1
00:01:04,187 --> 00:01:06,773
- Upstairs!
- What's going on?

2
00:01:06,898 --> 00:01:07,940
Who are you?

3
00:01:09,859 --> 00:01:12,070
Dade! Dade!

4
00:01:13,029 --> 00:01:14,113
Knock it down.

5
00:01:16,074 --> 00:01:18,409
The defendant, Dade Murphy,

6
00:01:18,743 --> 00:01:22,372
who calls himself 'Zero Cool',

7
00:01:22,497 --> 00:01:27,377
has repeatedly committed criminal acts
of a malicious nature.

8
00:01:27,502 --> 00:01:31,923
This defendant possesses
a superior intelligence,

9
00:01:32,048 --> 00:01:36,511
which he uses to a destructive
and antisocial end.

10
00:01:37,971 --> 00:01:46,062
His computer virus crashed 1 507 systems,
including Wall Street trading systems,

11
00:01:46,187 --> 00:01:51,275
single-handedly causing a seven-point
drop in the New York stock market.

12
00:01:51,985 --> 00:01:56,739
Dade Murphy, l hereby fine
your family $45,000.

13
00:01:57,699 --> 00:02:02,120
l sentence you to probation.
You are forbidden to use a computer

14
00:02:02,245 --> 00:02:06,416
or a touchtone telephone until
the day of your 18th birthday.

15
00:04:37,942 --> 00:04:40,570
- Dade?
- Yeah, Mom?

16
00:04:40,778 --> 00:04:42,322
What are you doing?

17
00:04:44,324 --> 00:04:46,909
Taking over a TV network.

18
00:04:47,452 --> 00:04:51,622
Finish up, honey. Go to sleep.
And happy birthday.

19
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,465
Security, Norm...

20
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:01,549
Norman speaking.

21
00:05:01,674 --> 00:05:04,844
Norman. This is Mr Eddie Vedder
from Accounting.

22
00:05:04,969 --> 00:05:08,973
I had a power surge here at home
that wiped out a fiIe I was working on.

23
00:05:09,932 --> 00:05:12,852
l'm in big trouble.
You know anything about computers?

24
00:05:14,395 --> 00:05:15,563
Gee...

25
00:05:15,688 --> 00:05:20,360
My BLT drive on my computer
just went AWOL,

26
00:05:20,485 --> 00:05:24,822
and l have this big project
due tomorrow for Mr Kawasaki.

27
00:05:24,947 --> 00:05:27,158
lf l screw up, he'll make me
commit hari-kari.

28
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:32,372
You know these Japanese
management techniques.

29
00:05:33,373 --> 00:05:35,875
CouId you read me
the number on the modem?

30
00:05:37,794 --> 00:05:40,296
It's a IittIe boxy thing
with switches on it.

31
00:05:40,421 --> 00:05:42,382
It Iets my computer
taIk to the one there.

32
00:05:42,507 --> 00:05:43,383
212...

33
00:05:43,508 --> 00:05:48,054
555 4240.

34
00:06:10,618 --> 00:06:16,416
So-caIIed American Indians, Latinos,
and bIacks are geneticaIIy mediocre.

35
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:18,334
Yak, yak, yak.

36
00:06:19,419 --> 00:06:20,503
Get a job.

37
00:06:53,911 --> 00:06:57,040
You are about to experience
the awe and mystery

38
00:06:57,165 --> 00:06:58,666
which reaches from
the inner mind

39
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:02,128
to... The Outer Limits.

40
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:14,849
Zero...

41
00:07:16,309 --> 00:07:17,185
No, wait.

42
00:07:29,781 --> 00:07:30,490
Unbelievable.

43
00:07:30,698 --> 00:07:32,200
A hacker.

44
00:07:38,748 --> 00:07:42,251
Yeah, okay, Acid Burn. That's enough.

45
00:08:28,423 --> 00:08:30,550
Shit on me!

46
00:08:36,222 --> 00:08:39,517
Good morning.
Did you unpack your stuff yet?

47
00:08:41,644 --> 00:08:43,396
Up all night again?

48
00:08:43,771 --> 00:08:46,607
Can this wait until both
of my eyes are open?

49
00:08:49,694 --> 00:08:53,489
Can l cut the electricity to his room
so he'll get some sleep?

50
00:08:53,614 --> 00:08:57,285
He's been playing with his computer
all night for a week.

51
00:08:58,077 --> 00:09:00,079
Yes, he could be playing with himself.

52
00:09:01,664 --> 00:09:04,125
Yes, l'll ask. Dade,

53
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,669
you like girls, don't you?

54
00:09:06,794 --> 00:09:09,839
Yeah. l just haven't found one
as charming as you.

55
00:09:11,841 --> 00:09:13,676
You haven't done anything stupid, right?

56
00:09:14,761 --> 00:09:16,304
Right, Dade?

57
00:09:16,471 --> 00:09:17,597
Right, Mom.

58
00:09:17,972 --> 00:09:19,641
And l'm still a virgin.

59
00:09:35,323 --> 00:09:37,867
You hooked it up to the phone,
didn't you?

60
00:09:38,326 --> 00:09:41,329
Dade, turn the shower off!

61
00:09:43,581 --> 00:09:46,918
You screw up again
and you won't get into coIIege.

62
00:09:59,764 --> 00:10:02,225
l'm sorry we had to move
in your senior year.

63
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:06,145
l didn't want to sell the house
but l had to take this job. You know that.

64
00:10:07,647 --> 00:10:10,233
You'II Iove New York.
It's the city that never sIeeps.

65
00:10:47,937 --> 00:10:51,607
l miss you, too, baby.
Claro que sí.

66
00:10:52,817 --> 00:10:54,319
Excuse me.

67
00:10:54,819 --> 00:10:56,738
Chill, man. l'm talking to Venezuela.

68
00:10:56,863 --> 00:10:59,240
l'm sorry. Where's the principal's office?

69
00:10:59,365 --> 00:11:00,783
l can't help you, kid.

70
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,758
Do you have your transfer forms?

71
00:11:19,177 --> 00:11:21,804
lt's a straightforward question.

72
00:11:27,769 --> 00:11:29,145
Do you speak English?

73
00:11:29,395 --> 00:11:31,731
Sorry, you wanted...

74
00:11:31,856 --> 00:11:33,358
Transfer forms.

75
00:11:42,992 --> 00:11:44,410
Are you coming?

76
00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:00,760
The gym is through there
and the cafeteria is through there.

77
00:12:01,302 --> 00:12:03,346
Great. Cool.

78
00:12:06,891 --> 00:12:08,351
What's your name?

79
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:10,770
Kate. Kate Libby.

80
00:12:11,562 --> 00:12:13,022
Here's your class.

81
00:12:13,356 --> 00:12:16,109
My class.
l'm not in your class?

82
00:12:16,901 --> 00:12:18,778
No, you're not in my class.

83
00:12:22,115 --> 00:12:23,616
Give me time.

84
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,284
- You new?
- Yeah.

85
00:12:26,035 --> 00:12:27,620
Tell him about the pool, Kate.

86
00:12:28,871 --> 00:12:29,789
Pool?

87
00:12:29,872 --> 00:12:33,543
There's an Olympic-size
swimming pool on the roof.

88
00:12:34,335 --> 00:12:36,129
Take the stairs over there.

89
00:12:37,171 --> 00:12:39,549
Yeah. Sure.

90
00:12:41,592 --> 00:12:42,969
Thanks.

91
00:12:47,181 --> 00:12:49,017
Hey! Hold the door!

92
00:12:54,188 --> 00:12:55,273
No pool.

93
00:13:29,515 --> 00:13:31,768
Oh, my God. He found the pool.

94
00:13:36,272 --> 00:13:37,649
I'm Mr Simpson.

95
00:13:37,774 --> 00:13:41,819
I'm subbing for Ms BayIess,
who was arrested at the anti-fur raIIy.

96
00:13:44,572 --> 00:13:50,328
I know some ofyou kids got computers

Chapter One.
'Designing GraphicaI Interface'.

98
00:14:06,719 --> 00:14:09,222
What's your interest in Kate Libby?

99
00:14:09,347 --> 00:14:11,265
Academic, purely sexual?

100
00:14:11,474 --> 00:14:13,101
Homicidal.

101
00:14:13,768 --> 00:14:16,688
What's up, man? l'm the Phreak.

102
00:14:17,438 --> 00:14:20,400
The Fantom Phreak?
The King of Nynex?

103
00:14:22,652 --> 00:14:24,404
l know you play the game.

104
00:14:24,737 --> 00:14:27,198
Phreak, Phreak, Phreak.
Dude, dude, dude.

105
00:14:27,407 --> 00:14:30,994
Joey! One more 'dude'
and l'll slap the shit out of you.

106
00:14:31,661 --> 00:14:35,790
You gotta stop letting your mama
dress you, man. You're hopeless!

107
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:39,836
- Check it.
- l need a handle.

108
00:14:41,546 --> 00:14:43,923
l don't have an identity
until l have a handle.

109
00:14:44,048 --> 00:14:47,302
You're right about that.
Check it. Friday.

110
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:54,392
Wait. How about The Master of Disaster?

111
00:14:54,517 --> 00:14:56,728
You're utterly hopeless, man.

112
00:14:56,853 --> 00:14:59,272
Ultra Laser... Doctor Doom!

113

121
00:15:54,285 --> 00:15:55,703
No, thank you.

122
00:16:26,234 --> 00:16:28,653
That's a nice score for a girl.

123
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,074
Think you can do better?

124

125
00:16:51,175 --> 00:16:53,219
ls this kid bothering you, Kate?

126
00:16:54,137 --> 00:16:56,097
Could l get some room here?

127
00:16:56,973 --> 00:16:58,725
Why don't you come up here?

128
00:17:37,263 --> 00:17:38,348
He's good!

129
00:17:49,067 --> 00:17:51,527
Well, it looks like l'm on top.

130
00:17:55,573 --> 00:17:58,993
Congratulations.
No-one's ever beat her before.

131
00:17:59,243 --> 00:18:01,120
You just made an enemy for life.

132
00:18:03,748 --> 00:18:06,084
Boy meets world. Let's go.

133
00:18:25,228 --> 00:18:27,313
- Who's that?
- Curtis.

134
00:18:28,856 --> 00:18:30,024
What's he do?

135
00:18:30,149 --> 00:18:33,027
You're looking at it.
He looks slick all day.

136
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:36,614
Joey!

137
00:19:16,654 --> 00:19:17,989
What's up?

138
00:19:24,162 --> 00:19:27,290
Oh, my God! You...?

139

Way cool!

140
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:43,890
You saw that?

141
00:19:44,307 --> 00:19:45,683
What the hell is going on?

142
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,019
Pool on the roof must be leaking.

143
00:19:58,112 --> 00:20:00,156
Oh, man. This is going to be good.

l'm not sure your mother qualifies

Emmanuel Goldstein, sir.

You, however, are not on my list.

00:21:30,371 --> 00:21:33,041
Class crashing. Come on.

164
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,584
Now get out.

165
00:21:36,377 --> 00:21:38,087
Thank you, sir.

166
00:21:44,927 --> 00:21:46,387
How was school?

167
00:21:49,557 --> 00:21:51,893
- What did we learn in school today?
- Revenge.

168
00:21:52,018 --> 00:21:54,687
Ahh. Did we meet someone special?

169
00:21:55,104 --> 00:21:56,689
No. No-one special.

170
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:02,654
l have to get back to work.
Would you please try to fill these out?

171
00:22:03,696 --> 00:22:04,656
Don't worry,

172
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:06,741
it's only the rest of your life.

173
00:22:08,242 --> 00:22:11,996
Anything else?
Want me to mow the lawn?

174
00:22:12,121 --> 00:22:14,666
Oops, l forgot. New York, no grass.

175
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:16,751
And unpack.

176
00:22:40,858 --> 00:22:44,404
You can sit at home
and do absolutely nothing

177
00:22:45,196 --> 00:22:47,615
and your name goes through
17 computers a day.

178
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:50,994
'1984'? Yeah, right. That's a typo.

179
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:56,291
Orwell's here and living large.
We have no names, man. No names!

180
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:58,584
Can l score a fry?

181
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:01,504
Meet Cereal Killer.

182
00:23:01,629 --> 00:23:03,131
As in Fruit Loops.

183
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:05,091
But he does know things.

184
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:07,093
Anyway, guys, listen.

185
00:23:07,927 --> 00:23:09,971
l'm in this computer, right?
l'm looking around...

186
00:23:10,096 --> 00:23:12,098
You got those Crayola books?

187
00:23:12,223 --> 00:23:14,100
Yeah, technicolour rainbow.

188
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:16,519
Green one.

189
00:23:16,644 --> 00:23:18,730
What is that? Let me see?

190
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:22,108
- What are these?
- lnternational UNlX environments.

191
00:23:22,233 --> 00:23:23,901
Luscious orange.

192
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:27,530
Computer security criteria...
DOD standards.

193
00:23:28,948 --> 00:23:31,492
The pink-shirt book... guide to lBM PCs.

194
00:23:31,617 --> 00:23:34,954
So-called due to the nasty pink shirt
the guy wears on the cover.

195
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:36,873
Devil book, the UNlX bible.

196
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:39,584
- What's that?
- Dragon book, compiler design.

197
00:23:41,544 --> 00:23:43,421
- What's that?
- The Red book.

198
00:23:43,546 --> 00:23:45,923
NSA-trusted networks.

199
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:50,094
Otherwise known as 'The Ugly Red Book
That Won't Fit On A Shelf'.

200
00:23:50,219 --> 00:23:54,557
Anyway, guys. Come on.
l'm in this computer, right.

201
00:23:55,183 --> 00:24:00,104
l'm looking around, throwing commands.
l don't know what it does or anything.

202
00:24:00,229 --> 00:24:01,397
lt's choice.

203
00:24:01,522 --> 00:24:05,443
lt's beautiful. Four hours
just messing around in there.

204
00:24:05,568 --> 00:24:08,446
Finally, l figure out...

205
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,239
that it's a bank.

206
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:14,869
Okay, wait. lt's a bank. So, this morning,
l check the paper,

207
00:24:14,994 --> 00:24:20,583
some cash machine in, like, Bumsville,
ldaho, spits out $700 into the street.

208
00:24:20,708 --> 00:24:22,418
- That's kinda cool.
- That was me.

209
00:24:22,543 --> 00:24:25,546
- l did that.
- You did this from your house?

210
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,675
Are you stoned or stupid?

211
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,804
You don't hack a bank from your house!
You get nailed by the FBl.

212
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:34,305
Are your brains in your ass?

213
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:35,932
Don't you know anything?

214
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:38,685
lt's universally stupid, man.

215
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:42,313
l don't know things because you guys
won't tell me anything. Right?

216
00:24:42,438 --> 00:24:44,357
What are the three most used passwords?

217
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:48,194
'Love', 'Secret' and 'Sex'.

218
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:51,072
But not in that order, necessarily. Right?

219
00:24:51,197 --> 00:24:56,119
Don't forget 'God'. System operators
love to use 'God'. Male ego.

220
00:24:56,411 --> 00:25:01,291
To be elite, you have to do a righteous
hack, not this accidental shit.

221
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:06,170
Which means you score
one of those Gibsons, man.

222
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:10,383
Those supercomputers they use
to do physics and look for oil.

223
00:25:10,508 --> 00:25:13,052
No way, man. Security is too tight.

224
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:16,139
Maybe. But if l wanted to hack
some heavy metal,

225
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:19,851
l'd work my way in
through some back door.

226
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:25,315
Oh, man. Wouldn't you just love
to get one of those Gibsons?

227
00:25:26,232 --> 00:25:28,067
Who ate all of my fries?

228
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:32,530
- Joey!
- No, l didn't touch your fries.

229
00:25:33,364 --> 00:25:36,284
- Cereal, man. You owe me a pack.
- lt was him.

230
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:39,120
- Lay off that shit, man.
- l'm gonna hit you!

231
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:43,768
Yes! Home run, home run. Okay, okay.

232
00:26:45,436 --> 00:26:47,105
You and me, Lucy.

233
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:49,691
We're gonna show them, baby.

234
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:51,109
Ow!

235
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:23,391
Mr BeIford?

236
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:26,936
My name is The Plague.

237
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:30,565
Mr The PIague, something weird
is happening on the net.

238
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:33,359
As in what, you hapless techno-weenie?

239
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:36,863
One of the Gibsons is working really hard.

240
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:40,533
We got one person on-line
but with the workload of 10 users.

241
00:27:40,616 --> 00:27:42,035
l think we got a hacker.

242
00:27:47,081 --> 00:27:50,043
Okay, we need proof that we were here.

243
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:55,798
Yeah. Garbage. Give me Garbage.

244
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:09,103
Shit.

245
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:37,215
Never fear,

246
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:39,759
l is here.

247
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:45,974
- l located the activity to terminal 23.
- Let's echo 23, see what's up.

248
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,492
God wouldn't be up this late.

249
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:19,382
Shit!

250
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:23,928
Get me the switching control centre.
l need to trace this call.

251
00:29:30,768 --> 00:29:33,479
Hold on, Mom. Hold on one second.

252
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:37,525
- Open the door, Joseph.
- Yeah, okay.

253
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:40,486
There you go.

254
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:42,905
Bed. Sleep.

255
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:45,575
Now!

256
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,828
Sweet dreams, Joseph.

257
00:29:52,915 --> 00:29:53,875
He's gone.

258
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,501
Did you get a trace?

259
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:57,128
Yeah, we got him.

260
00:29:57,503 --> 00:29:58,671
Good.

261
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:14,812
Nice place, huh?

262
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:21,319
You heard of a hacker called Acid Burn?

263
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:25,031
- You know who he is?
- No. Don't know who he is.

264
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:26,157
Do you?

265
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:31,412
Nikon! Lord Nikon, this is...

266
00:30:31,537 --> 00:30:32,914
Crash Override.

267
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,416
Never heard of you.
You done anything?

268
00:30:35,541 --> 00:30:36,292
No.

269
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:39,796
Come on!

270
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:45,301
What? Your Mom buy you
a 'puter for Christmas?

271
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:50,431
- Does he know anything?
- Sure. He's elite.

272
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,059
Come in.

273
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:02,777
- Nikon, can l crash at your place tonight?
- Again?

274
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:05,363
Yeah, sure.

275
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:12,245
Hackers penetrate and ravage

276
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:15,957
public and private computer systems,
infecting them with viruses...

277
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:17,709
Who are these guys?

278
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:22,588
Richard Gill.
Hacker enemy number one. Real boner.

279
00:31:23,589 --> 00:31:25,925
Showtime. Showtime!

280
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,848
- What's going on?
- Four,

281
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:35,143
three, two, one...

282
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:38,646
WeIcome to our show!

283
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:39,731
Hack the PIanet!

284
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:42,066
Hack the Planet!

285
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:46,279
For Iate night hacks, JoIt CoIa,
soft drink ofthe eIite hacker.

286
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:48,781
- Who are these guys?
- That's Razor and Blade.

287
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:50,783
Razor and Blade?

288
00:31:50,908 --> 00:31:53,369
That's right. This is a pay-phone.

289
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:55,246
Don't ask.

290
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:59,083
As you can see, this isjust a simpIe
micro-cassette recorder.

291
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:02,837
Hook it up to the phone,
and drop in five bucks in quarters.

292
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:06,382
Record the tone the coins make,
hang up, get your money back.

293
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:09,927
Never again pay for a service
that wouId be cheap,

294
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:12,388
if it weren't run
by profiteering gIuttons.

295
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:16,100
Remember, hacking is more than
just a crime. It's a survivaI trait.

296
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,605
l'm a real wild child,
l'm a wild one

297
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,524
l'm a wild one

298
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:29,113
Thank you! Thank you very much!

299
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:34,327
Joey! Joey! Thank you!

300
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:35,745
Freeze!

301
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,163
- What?
- Get out of there!

302
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:38,122
Out!

303
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:41,209
- Joey!
- Get in there!

304
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,211
Sit down!

305
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:44,796
Lucy!

306
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,131
Where are you taking her?

307
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:49,676
Joey!

308
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:00,853
- How's it going, Ray?
- Looks good, sir.

309
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,814
We got an uncorrupted hard drive.

310
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:04,899
ln English, please.

311
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,985
l didn't protect the President
for ten years

312
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:09,028
to finish my career
feeling like an idiot.

313
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:13,157
l'm sorry, sir. He didn't have time
to erase his computer files.

314
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:17,161
Good. Let's finish up here.
Take him in for interrogation.

315
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:19,497
Agent Gill, can you spare a moment?

316
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:21,749
Why, of course, Jennifer.

317
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:25,837
- Joey!
- How dangerous are hackers?

318
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:31,968
Hackers penetrate and ravage public
and private computer systems,

319
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:35,805
infecting them with viruses
and stealing sensitive materials.

320
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,640
These people are terrorists.

321
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:56,409
Morning, gentlemen.

322
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:57,952
Please, be seated.

323
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:01,748
l see we're still dressing
in the dark, Eugene.

324
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:05,668
Once again, don't call me Eugene.

325
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:07,295
Our recent intruder

326
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:12,800
penetrated using a superuser account,
giving him access to our whole system.

327
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:16,429
Precisely what you're paid to prevent.

328
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:21,434
Someone didn't bother reading my memo
on commonly used passwords.

329
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:25,521
As l meticulously pointed out,
the foremost used passwords are...

330
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:30,610
'Love', 'Sex', 'Secret' and 'God'.

331
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:34,572
So would Your Holiness
care to change her password?

332
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:38,618
A hacker planted the virus.

333
00:34:39,369 --> 00:34:40,828
Virus?

334
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:48,628
Yesterday, the ballast program
for a supertanker training model

335
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:52,840
mistakenly thought the vessel was empty
and flooded its tanks.

336
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:54,634
Excuse me?

337
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:58,262
The little boat flipped over.

338
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:03,267
A virus planted within the Gibson system
claimed responsibility.

339
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:04,519
lt left a note?

340
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:14,570
UnIess $5 miIIion is transferred
to the foIIowing account in 7 days,

341
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:17,657
I wiII capsize five tankers
in the EIIingson fIeet.

342
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:20,201
- ls that...?
- That is the virus.

343
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:22,287
Leonardo da Vinci.

344
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:27,083
We have 26 ships at sea
and don't know which ones are infected.

345
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:31,170
Well, put the ship's ballast
under manual control.

346
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:32,797
There's no such thing any more.

347
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:35,300
These ships are totally computerised.

348
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:37,927
They rely on satellite navigation

349
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:42,849
which links them to our network,
and the virus, wherever they are.

350
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:45,059
What are we supposed to do?

351
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:49,439
Luckily, you have a gifted
and talented security officer.

352
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:53,359
l traced the hacker's call.
The Secret Service picked him up.

353
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:58,114
l'll search his files for the original
virus code and eliminate it.

354
00:35:58,281 --> 00:36:01,534
We expect you
to get on this right away.

355
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:06,581
- How soon?
- As fast as l can.

356
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:11,210
This is common in corporations
as large as ours. Don't worry about it.

357
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:14,922
The Secret Service
is helping us out, 100 percent.

358
00:36:16,758 --> 00:36:17,967
We'll be in touch.

359
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,303
What the hell was that all about?

360
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:23,765
l had to move fast.
The hacker copied my garbage file.

361
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:24,891
What?

362
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:28,686
l created da Vinci so we could
get the Secret Service

363
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:32,273
to arrest the hacker and seize
the equipment, which we can't do alone.

364
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:38,905
- l don't want to go to jail for this.
- Relax. Think about the $25 million.

365
00:36:39,072 --> 00:36:45,411
But you created a virus that's going to
cause a worldwide ecological disaster.

366
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:48,498
Just to arrest some hacker kid?

367
00:36:48,665 --> 00:36:50,458
Basically, yes.

368
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:54,003
Jesus! You're sick, Eugene.

369
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:55,505
l'll take care of this.

370
00:36:56,714 --> 00:37:00,843
l can cancel it any time.
l don't need the code.

371
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:03,388
What better way to confiscate the disk

372
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:06,557
and find out how much of
the garbage file was copied.

373
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:08,726
Get it!

374
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:12,981
Why did l ever trust you?

375
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:18,778
Get the file, otherwise
you'll lose all your toys.

376
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:30,415
Did you find the virus program
on the disks we confiscated?

377
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:35,044
No. He's either very smart or very stupid.

378
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:41,718
Then he stashed it somewhere,
or he has an accomplice.

379
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:49,267
We'll release him. Keep tight surveillance
and see if he leads us to your disk.

380
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:58,943
Unit 3, outside suspect
Joey PardeIIa's apartment.

381
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:02,155
Suspect stiII grounded... by his mother.

382
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:04,032
Listen to this buIIshit.

383
00:38:04,574 --> 00:38:09,120
'This is our worId now. The worId
of the eIectron and the switch,

384
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,289
'the beauty ofthe baud.

385
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:16,210
'We exist without nationality,
skin colour or religious bias.

386
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:19,547
'You wage wars, murder,
cheat, lie to us,

387
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:23,384
'and try to make us believe it's for
our own good, yet we're the criminals.

388
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:28,014
'Yes, l am a criminal.
My crime is that of curiosity.

389
00:38:28,181 --> 00:38:32,769
'l am a hacker
and this is my manifesto.'

390
00:38:34,187 --> 00:38:35,813
Right? Manifesto?

391
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:36,981
'You may stop me,

392
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:39,901
'but you can't stop us all.'

393
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:42,195
That's cool.

394
00:38:42,362 --> 00:38:44,405
- Cool?
- Yeah, cool.

395
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:45,698
You think it's cool?

396
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:50,828
- lt's cool.
- lt's not cool. lt's commie bullshit.

397
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:01,005
Can l crash at your place tonight?

398
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,299
What's with him?

399
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:06,594
His parents missed Woodstock
and he's been making up for it since.

400
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,554
You hear about Joey's bust?

401
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:13,226
Probably had something to do
with that bank in ldaho.

402
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:15,228
You think he could hack a Gibson?

403
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:19,857
- Did you talk to him?
- No. His mom says he's grounded

404
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:23,987
for his next three lifetimes. And no
'consorting with computer friends'.

405
00:39:24,404 --> 00:39:26,489
The Secret Service is out to get him.

406
00:39:26,948 --> 00:39:29,450
Want to go to a big party tonight?

407
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:31,286
lt's at Kate's.

408
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,579
l thought so.

409
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:36,416
A little pelvis.

410
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:38,543
A little pelvis.

411
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:58,688
What the hell are you doing?

412
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:00,315
Plague!

413
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:01,858
Plague!

414
00:40:03,026 --> 00:40:03,943
Gill.

415
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:06,487
l think we got something.

416
00:40:06,863 --> 00:40:09,907
Yuk!... Hard copy!

417
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:13,244
Dade Murphy.

418
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:17,248
- Secret Service!
- Don't move!

419
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:18,082
What are you...?

420
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:19,542
Shut up!

421
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:23,796
What are you doing? Get off me!

422
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:26,841
God!

423
00:40:27,467 --> 00:40:30,219
Sit on the bed and keep your hands
where we can see them.

424
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,474
The year was 1988.

425
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:39,395
A nasty virus crashed
1 ,500 systems in one day.

426
00:40:42,482 --> 00:40:44,025
1 ,507.

427
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,943
lt got you 7 years' probation.

428
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:49,530
No computer. No touchtone phones.

429
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:53,701
Must have been hell, huh, Zero Cool?

430
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:59,874
A virus has been planted in
the Ellingson Mineral computer system.

431
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:02,418
You were our prime suspect.

432
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:06,005
Till we trashed your stuff
and found no trace of it.

433
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:10,885
We believe that Joey Pardella
is involved in this Ellingson virus.

434
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:16,391
He or his accomplice has a disk that
Mr Belford needs to disable that virus.

435
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:19,602
We want you to help us find it.

436
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:20,311
Gill.

437
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:34,117
Loser.

438
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:39,539
l can't believe you were only 1 1
when you wrote this.

439
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:44,836
lt's quite an impressive virus.

440
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:48,423
Dade.

441
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:55,138
l know how you might feel about narking
on your friends, but... we're hackers.

442
00:41:55,305 --> 00:41:59,934
For us, there's no such thing
as family and friends.

443
00:42:00,143 --> 00:42:04,939
We're each our own country,
with temporary allies and enemies.

444
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:09,736
Let's make a treaty.

445
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:14,032
l'm sorry. Who are you?

446
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:21,039
l'm the one who understands you.

447
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:24,584
Now, can we be allies?

448
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:30,548
Nah. l don't play well with others.

449
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,775
Shit! Come on!

450
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:52,111
Watch which friends you do play with.

451
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:58,159
With your record, you could land in jail
or get expelled. No college. No future.

452
00:42:59,035 --> 00:43:02,914
Exiled from everyone
and everything you love.

453
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,086
l'll be in touch.

454
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:11,756
He's fine.
Oh, and Dade,

455
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:16,302
- try to stay out of trouble, okay?
- Blow me.

456
00:43:17,804 --> 00:43:18,888
Thank you.

457
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:29,167
Her Mom makes big bucks
writing books for women.

458
00:44:29,459 --> 00:44:32,879
Stuff like 'Women Who Love Men
Who Are Emotional Amoebae'.

459
00:44:33,588 --> 00:44:34,839
That explains a lot.

460
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:55,151
Big man, stepping in.
Coming through.

461
00:44:55,735 --> 00:44:58,988
Big man, big boots.
You look good, girl.

462
00:45:02,951 --> 00:45:07,080
- Yo, what's up, Nikon?
- ln the house, man. Thanks.

463
00:45:07,622 --> 00:45:09,082
Dade, man. You made it.

464
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:12,335
Houston, we have lift-off.

465
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:15,463
Three o'clock. Check it.
Don't look right away!

466
00:45:15,588 --> 00:45:17,131
Look at her, man.

467
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:26,057
Lisa Blair.
26 East 7th Street, apartment 16.

468
00:45:26,182 --> 00:45:27,433
555 4817.

469
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:28,434
Boom!

470
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:32,063
- How'd you know that?
- l got a photographic memory.

471
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:34,023
lt's a curse.

472
00:45:34,232 --> 00:45:35,483
Lisa!

473
00:45:41,322 --> 00:45:46,619
Oh! Look at that pooper, man.
Spandex, it's a privilege, not a right.

474
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:55,962
Hi, my name's Vicki and l'm an addict.

475
00:45:57,463 --> 00:46:00,008
Hi. My name's Hank and l'm an addict.

476
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:03,845
My name's Joey, but...

477
00:46:05,013 --> 00:46:06,097
l'm not an addict.

478

No, really. Listen.

l got in trouble with my computer.

480
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:14,564
My lawyer told the judge l'm an addict,
but l'm not addicted to my computer.

481
00:46:15,023 --> 00:46:15,940
No, really.

482
00:46:16,691 --> 00:46:17,775
l'm not an addict.

483
00:46:18,151 --> 00:46:19,068

Yo! Check this out.
This is insanely great.

487
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,799
- Yeah? Display?
- Active matrix.

488
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:44,052
A million psychedelic colours.

489
00:46:44,177 --> 00:46:45,762
This baby is sweet.

490
00:46:46,679 --> 00:46:49,474
- l want it.

491
00:46:49,766 --> 00:46:51,643

492
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:10,995
Shit!

493
00:47:12,288 --> 00:47:14,332
Come on. Get out.

494
00:47:14,499 --> 00:47:16,876
- Was that her top?
- One-handed.

495
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:18,628
Difficulty rating?

496
00:47:19,796 --> 00:47:20,797
Seven.

497
00:47:23,716 --> 00:47:27,887
Wow!... Burn's wetware
matches her software.

498
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:30,932
Burn?

499
00:47:32,517 --> 00:47:34,018
What are you doing here?

500
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:36,980
We're sorry! Just looking
at your fly laptop.

501
00:47:37,105 --> 00:47:38,564
lt's hype, you know.

502
00:47:38,690 --> 00:47:40,149
You're in the butter zone now, baby.

503
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:44,654
Yeah, it is.

504
00:47:46,239 --> 00:47:47,740
l want to triple the RAM.

505
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:52,620
Leopard boy and the deceptor cons.

506
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:57,667
Kate! You're not going into that
computer shit now, right?

507
00:47:59,627 --> 00:48:00,878
Later, babe.

508
00:48:02,463 --> 00:48:05,383
- Yeah, right.
- The sensitive type.

509
00:48:07,635 --> 00:48:09,012
What's he doing here?

510
00:48:09,137 --> 00:48:10,763
He's my guest, Burn.

511
00:48:11,222 --> 00:48:12,307
You're Acid Burn?!

512
00:48:12,473 --> 00:48:14,350
You booted me out of OTV.

513
00:48:15,226 --> 00:48:17,854
- What?
- l'm Crash Override.

514
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:21,441
You're the moron
who's been invading my turf?

515
00:48:23,109 --> 00:48:24,360
Whoa, whoa! Crash...

516
00:48:24,485 --> 00:48:25,486
and Burn!

517
00:48:38,333 --> 00:48:40,543
Murphy kid turn you down?

518
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:47,091
l disguised myself as an Alabama State
Trooper and penetrated the FBl NClC.

519
00:48:47,258 --> 00:48:48,509
Pervert.

520
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:51,220
What are you talking about?

521
00:48:53,681 --> 00:48:57,477
The FBl computer holds files
on 20 million Americans.

522
00:48:58,269 --> 00:49:00,146
l just hacked into it.

523
00:49:00,647 --> 00:49:02,190
Congratulations.

524
00:49:02,899 --> 00:49:06,861
l have access to every piece of data
stored on Dade Murphy's parents.

525
00:49:07,946 --> 00:49:13,368
His parents separated five years ago,
reconciled, then divorced last year.

526
00:49:13,493 --> 00:49:14,619
Custody battle.

527
00:49:14,786 --> 00:49:16,955
Boy chose to go with his mother.

528
00:49:17,372 --> 00:49:18,331
So?

529
00:49:19,707 --> 00:49:24,921
So, we get the mother, we get the boy.

530
00:50:11,884 --> 00:50:13,511
What the hell are you doing?

531
00:50:14,429 --> 00:50:16,264
lt's cool, l'm just looking.

532
00:50:17,807 --> 00:50:20,476
- lt's too much machine for you.
- Yeah?

533
00:50:31,654 --> 00:50:33,948
l hope you don't screw like you type.

534
00:50:40,872 --> 00:50:42,624
lt has a killer refresh rate.

535
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,712
P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.

536
00:50:47,837 --> 00:50:51,132
lt's not just the chip. lt has a PCl bus.

537
00:50:51,257 --> 00:50:53,384
But... you knew that.

538
00:50:54,010 --> 00:50:55,678
lndeed.

539
00:50:56,095 --> 00:50:58,306
RlSC architecture is going
to change everything.

540
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:00,892
Yeah. RlSC is good.

541
00:51:05,897 --> 00:51:09,067
Sure this sweet machine's
not going to waste?

542
00:51:11,402 --> 00:51:13,821
Crash Override. What was it?

543
00:51:14,113 --> 00:51:18,284
'Mess with the best, die like the rest'?

544
00:51:18,952 --> 00:51:19,953
Yeah.

545
00:51:24,707 --> 00:51:26,084
Are you challenging me?

546
00:51:26,209 --> 00:51:27,293
Name your stakes.

547
00:51:28,378 --> 00:51:31,673
lf l win, you become my slave.

548
00:51:33,758 --> 00:51:34,759
Your slave?

549
00:51:35,301 --> 00:51:36,511
You wish.

550
00:51:37,470 --> 00:51:40,473
You'll do shit work.
Scan, crack copyrights, whatever l want.

551
00:51:40,598 --> 00:51:42,517
Deal. And if l win?

552
00:51:42,642 --> 00:51:44,978
Make it my first born.

553
00:51:45,103 --> 00:51:47,522
- Make it our first date.
- You won't win.

554
00:51:48,731 --> 00:51:49,941
And you have to smile.

555
00:51:50,066 --> 00:51:52,735
l don't do dates.

556
00:51:53,486 --> 00:51:56,698
But l don't lose, either. So you're on.

557
00:52:03,079 --> 00:52:05,915

Any questions?

565
00:52:45,955 --> 00:52:49,667
Yeah. Who's going to notify
his next of kin?

566
00:53:42,929 --> 00:53:45,098
He's in the personal ads.

567
00:53:48,142 --> 00:53:52,730
'Disappointed white male, cross-dresser,
looking for discreet friend

00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:43,216

Tie.

You look pitiful.

615
00:58:33,970 --> 00:58:38,516
Okay, you're not grounded any more.

616

- So? A garbage file has shit in it.

618
00:59:11,799 --> 00:59:13,968
lt's hot or something.

619
00:59:14,093 --> 00:59:18,806
Joey, a garbage file holds odd data.
Stuff that's been erased.

620
00:59:18,931 --> 00:59:20,933
l copied it from Ellingson, okay?

621
00:59:21,059 --> 00:59:23,895
They're asking me about it.
Will you take a look for me?

622
00:59:27,106 --> 00:59:28,608
Shit, Joey. You got a tail.

623
00:59:30,068 --> 00:59:31,069
Shit!

624
01:00:16,406 --> 01:00:19,284
I am watching you.

Come on.

629

Stick your hands up! Don't move!

630
01:00:37,218 --> 01:00:38,386
Déjà vu!

631

You're under arrest under the Computer
Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986.

632
01:00:42,890 --> 01:00:44,058
¡La computadora de mierda!

Uno.

Understand?

638
01:01:22,347 --> 01:01:24,265

639
01:01:24,390 --> 01:01:26,434
- l'm having trouble with a number.
- What number, pIease?

640
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:28,519
555 4202.

641
01:01:28,645 --> 01:01:30,229
- Just one moment.
- Thank you.

642
01:01:31,814 --> 01:01:33,983
- Hello?
- lt's me. l'm freaking.

643
01:01:34,108 --> 01:01:38,404
Joey reaIIy hacked into EIIingson.
He gave me the disk he copied

644
01:01:38,529 --> 01:01:41,366
and now I'm injaiI
for some serious shit!

645
01:01:41,491 --> 01:01:45,161
Stuff l didn't even do, like inserting
a virus called 'da Vinci'?

646
01:01:45,286 --> 01:01:47,288
And they keep asking about you guys.

647
01:01:47,413 --> 01:01:48,998
- Think they're gonna bust us?
- Yeah.

648
01:01:49,123 --> 01:01:52,168
You better figure out what's on that disk
'cause we're being framed.

649
01:01:52,293 --> 01:01:54,420
lt's in the place where
l put that thing once.

650
01:02:30,415 --> 01:02:30,999
Hi.

651
01:02:33,251 --> 01:02:34,585
Now l see what all the fuss is about.

652
01:02:41,634 --> 01:02:43,177
You have company.

653
01:02:46,764 --> 01:02:48,933
- Nice room.
- We need your help.

654
01:02:50,935 --> 01:02:53,146
Do my ears deceive me?

655
01:02:55,690 --> 01:02:58,943
No, no. Truce, you guys.
We got a higher purpose here.

656
01:02:59,110 --> 01:03:01,321
A wake-up call for
the Nintendo generation.

657
01:03:01,446 --> 01:03:03,156
We demand free access to data.

658
01:03:03,281 --> 01:03:05,950
Well, it comes with some responsibility.

659
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:10,413
'When l was a child, l spake as a child,
l thought as a child.

660
01:03:10,538 --> 01:03:13,583
'But when l became a man,
l put away childish things'.

661
01:03:14,125 --> 01:03:17,253
What? lt's Corinthians One,

662
01:03:17,378 --> 01:03:21,090
Chapter 1 3, verse 1 1 , you know?
Come on.

663
01:03:25,511 --> 01:03:27,889
Phreak and Joey are being framed.

664
01:03:28,014 --> 01:03:30,391
Can you help us find out
what's on this disk?

665
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:31,643
l can't.

666
01:03:32,143 --> 01:03:35,396
Everybody who touches that disk
gets arrested. l can't risk arrest.

667
01:03:35,521 --> 01:03:36,731
l'm sorry.

668
01:03:41,027 --> 01:03:43,279
Maybe l should go to the bathroom.

669
01:03:51,079 --> 01:03:52,580
What is it with you?

670
01:03:53,581 --> 01:03:58,127
We're supposed to be on the same side
and we really need your help.

671
01:03:59,754 --> 01:04:01,589
l really need your help.

672
01:04:03,883 --> 01:04:06,302
l'm sorry. l can't.

673
01:04:10,765 --> 01:04:12,308
Could you copy the disk?

674
01:04:12,433 --> 01:04:16,396
And just hide it in case we get busted
so we have a copy for our lawyers.

675
01:04:16,521 --> 01:04:18,481
Something that hasn't been
tampered with.

676
01:04:23,111 --> 01:04:25,154
You guys help yourself
to anything in the fridge.

677
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:26,781
Cereal has.

678
01:04:32,996 --> 01:04:35,415
Okay. l'll copy it.

679
01:04:35,623 --> 01:04:36,582
Thank you.

680
01:04:43,881 --> 01:04:45,758
The girl. The girl has the disk l need.

681
01:04:47,051 --> 01:04:49,512
l told you.
l don't play well with others.

682
01:04:50,305 --> 01:04:52,223
Turn on your laptop.

683
01:04:53,057 --> 01:04:55,226
Set it to receive a file.

684
01:05:03,151 --> 01:05:07,280
Lauren Murphy is now a wanted feIon
in the state of Washington.

685
01:05:08,698 --> 01:05:12,035
Forgery, embezzlement,
two drug convictions

686
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:16,414
pIus jumping paroIe. Once arrested,
she wiII have no triaI,

687
01:05:16,539 --> 01:05:20,752
she wiII notpass 'Go',
she wiII go directIy tojaiI.

688
01:05:20,877 --> 01:05:26,758
Then l change this file back to the original
and your mom disappears.

689
01:05:26,883 --> 01:05:28,092
That's buIIshit.

690
01:05:28,718 --> 01:05:32,639
What can l tell you?
Computers never lie, kid.

691
01:05:33,723 --> 01:05:39,479
Your mom wiII be arrested,
handcuffed and Iater strip-searched.

692
01:05:39,562 --> 01:05:42,273
You lay a finger on her and l'll kill you.

693
01:05:43,149 --> 01:05:45,443
Kid, don't threaten me.

694
01:05:45,902 --> 01:05:50,531
There are worse things than death...
and l can do all of them.

695
01:06:29,946 --> 01:06:31,114
TaIk to me.

696
01:06:31,239 --> 01:06:34,784
l got it. But Kate didn't know
what's on it,

697
01:06:34,909 --> 01:06:36,911
she came to me to figure it out.

698
01:06:37,787 --> 01:06:40,623
She didn't plant the virus.
You leave her alone.

699
01:06:40,748 --> 01:06:44,585
Don't worry, kid. Ifshe's innocent,

700
01:06:44,711 --> 01:06:46,212
she'II be fine.

701
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:50,633
Your mommy's safe now, okay?

702
01:08:13,383 --> 01:08:14,342
Kate, Listen.

703
01:08:15,093 --> 01:08:16,219
Hold on.

704
01:08:16,386 --> 01:08:19,138
- l have to tell you something.
- Hold on!

705
01:08:19,430 --> 01:08:22,642
- lt's so lean and clean.
- Looks like a hacker wrote it.

706
01:08:23,351 --> 01:08:25,061
Come here. Look at this.

707
01:08:25,687 --> 01:08:27,480
This thing is tense.

708
01:08:28,523 --> 01:08:30,149
That's ill, man.

709
01:08:30,650 --> 01:08:32,110
lt's incomplete.

710
01:08:33,486 --> 01:08:37,031
This'll take forever to figure out.
l'll make some coffee.

711
01:08:40,410 --> 01:08:41,869
Tag, you're in.

712
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:06,037
- lt's not a virus. lt's a worm.
- What's it eat?

713
01:10:06,204 --> 01:10:07,997
lt nibbles. You see all of this?

714
01:10:08,122 --> 01:10:11,376
This is all of Ellingson's
financial transactions.

715
01:10:11,542 --> 01:10:15,046
From million dollar deals
to $10 some guy pays for gas.

716
01:10:15,213 --> 01:10:17,173
The worm eats a few cents
from each transaction.

717
01:10:17,340 --> 01:10:19,801
No-one's caught it because
the money isn't really gone.

718
01:10:19,968 --> 01:10:21,761
lt's just data being shifted around.

719
01:10:21,928 --> 01:10:26,140
And when the worm's ready, it zips out
with the money and erases its tracks.

720
01:10:26,265 --> 01:10:28,685
Joey got cut off before he got to that part.
Check it out.

721
01:10:28,851 --> 01:10:32,897
Here it's already running
at twice the speed as when it started.

722
01:10:33,064 --> 01:10:35,733
- At this rate, the run ends in...
- ..two days.

723
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:40,488
- lt's already eaten about...
- ..21 .8 million bucks.

724
01:10:41,823 --> 01:10:44,826
Whoever wrote this
needs someone to take the fall.

725
01:10:44,951 --> 01:10:47,704
That's Phreak and Joey and us.

726
01:10:47,870 --> 01:10:52,083
We have to find out where the money's
going before the worm disappears,

727
01:10:52,250 --> 01:10:54,544
so we can find out who created it.

728
01:10:54,711 --> 01:10:55,920
l know who wrote it!

729
01:10:56,421 --> 01:10:57,297
What?

730
01:10:57,463 --> 01:10:59,090
This Ellingson security creep.

731
01:10:59,716 --> 01:11:02,802
l gave him a copy of the disk
you gave me.

732
01:11:02,969 --> 01:11:03,845
You what?

733
01:11:04,012 --> 01:11:05,722
l didn't know what was on it.

734
01:11:05,847 --> 01:11:09,267
Oh, man! That's universally stupid, man.

735
01:11:09,434 --> 01:11:10,977
Yo, man. You're an amateur.

736
01:11:12,645 --> 01:11:13,730
Why did he come to you?

737
01:11:13,896 --> 01:11:15,690
l've got a record.

738
01:11:16,107 --> 01:11:17,734
l was Zero Cool.

739
01:11:17,859 --> 01:11:24,032
Zero Cool crashed 1 ,507 systems
in one day. Biggest crash in history.

740
01:11:24,198 --> 01:11:27,201
Front page New York Times,
August 10, 1988.

741
01:11:28,536 --> 01:11:30,246
l thought you was black, man.

742
01:11:30,872 --> 01:11:33,207
Yo, man, this is Zero Cool!

743
01:11:34,125 --> 01:11:35,209
That's far out!

744
01:11:35,376 --> 01:11:36,753
This is Zero Cool, man!

745
01:11:38,171 --> 01:11:39,714
Yeah, that's great.

746
01:11:40,173 --> 01:11:41,090
There goes MlT.

747
01:11:41,257 --> 01:11:43,343
- l'll make it up!
- How?

748
01:11:44,636 --> 01:11:45,845
l'll hack the Gibson.

749
01:11:46,012 --> 01:11:48,014
They'll trace you like that, man.

750
01:11:48,181 --> 01:11:49,974
The cops will find you
with a smoking gun.

751
01:11:50,099 --> 01:11:51,351
Fucked if l care, man.

752
01:11:51,517 --> 01:11:54,687
Even with the password,
it'd take you ten minutes to get in,

753
01:11:54,854 --> 01:11:56,481
then you'd have to find the files.

754
01:11:56,606 --> 01:11:58,858
The cops would have you in five minutes.

755
01:11:59,025 --> 01:12:01,694
Oh, wow! We are fried!

756
01:12:01,819 --> 01:12:04,322
Never send a boy to do a woman's job.

757
01:12:04,489 --> 01:12:06,574
With me, we can do it in seven.

758
01:12:06,824 --> 01:12:09,369
l help, we do it in six.

759
01:12:09,535 --> 01:12:13,748
l gotta save all your asses!
l help, we do it in five minutes.

760
01:12:13,915 --> 01:12:16,376
Okay. Let's go shopping.

761
01:12:44,779 --> 01:12:45,863
You know,

762
01:12:46,489 --> 01:12:51,536
if l didn't live by a strict code of honour,
l might take advantage of this situation.

763
01:12:51,661 --> 01:12:53,705
Erotically, as it were.

764
01:13:18,396 --> 01:13:20,315
All right. Hold it right there.

765
01:13:25,570 --> 01:13:26,904
Shit!

766
01:13:27,030 --> 01:13:29,073
My subway defence system.

767
01:13:34,829 --> 01:13:36,372
He's way down there.

768
01:13:38,166 --> 01:13:39,167
Ta-da!

769
01:13:39,709 --> 01:13:43,212
- Yo, brain-dead... the manual!
- Oops!

770
01:13:49,260 --> 01:13:50,261
Hey!

771
01:13:50,845 --> 01:13:51,846
Truck!

772
01:13:56,059 --> 01:13:57,060
Find it?

773
01:13:58,353 --> 01:14:01,689
The phone's all right. The problem
must be somewhere else.

774
01:14:41,604 --> 01:14:45,858
They had a large chunk
of the garbage file?

775
01:14:48,653 --> 01:14:52,240
- How much do they know?
- Enough to implicate us.

776
01:14:52,365 --> 01:14:55,034
You said the worm was untraceable.

777
01:14:55,159 --> 01:14:58,121
Yeah... to civilians.
But they're hackers.

778
01:14:58,246 --> 01:15:01,916
Don't worry.
We just launch the da Vinci virus.

779
01:15:02,583 --> 01:15:05,503
- Then they'll all be put away.
- Launch the da Vinci virus?

780
01:15:05,628 --> 01:15:09,382
- You can't do that.
- No-one believes the guilty.

781
01:15:09,507 --> 01:15:15,388
By the time they realise the truth,
we'll be long gone with all our money.

782
01:15:16,139 --> 01:15:19,267
Look, there is no right and wrong.

783
01:15:19,475 --> 01:15:22,353
There is only fun... and boring.

784
01:15:23,354 --> 01:15:26,941
A 30-year prison sentence
sounds pretty dull to me.

785
01:15:27,275 --> 01:15:28,735
Who do you prefer serves it?

786
01:15:28,860 --> 01:15:31,446
Us... or them?

787
01:15:49,255 --> 01:15:54,677
UnIess $5 miIIion is transferred
to the foIIowing account in seven days,

788
01:15:54,802 --> 01:15:57,847
I wiII capsize five EIIingson tankers.

789
01:15:57,972 --> 01:16:00,350
The virus goes off
tomorrow at 10.30AM,

790
01:16:00,475 --> 01:16:03,186
and those hackers tried
to get into our system again.

791
01:16:03,311 --> 01:16:06,314
l insist you take more strenuous action

792
01:16:06,439 --> 01:16:10,401
or Ellingson Mineral will hold
the Secret Service responsible.

793
01:16:14,072 --> 01:16:17,492
Get me arrest warrants
on Kate Libby, alias Acid Burn,

794
01:16:17,617 --> 01:16:20,036
Emmanuel Goldstein,
alias Cereal Killer,

795
01:16:20,161 --> 01:16:23,122
Dade Murphy,
aIias Crash Override, aIso known as

796
01:16:23,247 --> 01:16:28,169
Zero CooI, and PauI Cook,
aIias Lord Nikon.

797
01:16:28,503 --> 01:16:30,964
Pick them up tomorrow at 9.00AM.

798
01:16:32,799 --> 01:16:33,841
Snoop on to them

799
01:16:33,967 --> 01:16:36,010
as they snoop on to us.

800
01:16:41,224 --> 01:16:45,812
- Yeah, it's Kate.
- Hey, Burn. We got a little problem.

801
01:17:03,871 --> 01:17:04,956
So, what've we got?

802
01:17:05,081 --> 01:17:09,627
Well, 50 passwords, plus whatever
Polaroid-head got inside Ellingson.

803
01:17:09,752 --> 01:17:11,379
l got a lot, right?

804
01:17:11,713 --> 01:17:13,548
l don't know how many, but...

805
01:17:14,507 --> 01:17:15,633
my head hurts.

806
01:17:15,758 --> 01:17:17,260
Yo, check this out.

807
01:17:18,136 --> 01:17:19,762
- What's a da Vinci virus?
- What?

808
01:17:19,887 --> 01:17:24,684
lt's a memo about how they'll deal with
the oil spills that happened on the 14th.

809
01:17:25,810 --> 01:17:27,145
What oil spills?

810
01:17:29,188 --> 01:17:32,984
- Brain-dead. Today's the 1 3th.
- Well, this hasn't happened yet.

811
01:17:33,192 --> 01:17:35,862
The 14th is the day the worm ends it run.

812
01:17:38,615 --> 01:17:42,201
lsn't the da Vinci virus
what Phreak's being charged with?

813
01:17:42,327 --> 01:17:46,331
Look. 'lnfecting ballast programs
of Ellingson tankers'.

814
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:47,749
They blame hackers!

815
01:17:47,874 --> 01:17:48,875
Damn!

816
01:17:49,167 --> 01:17:51,127
A worm and a virus?

817
01:17:51,294 --> 01:17:52,837
The plot thickens.

818
01:17:58,885 --> 01:18:00,762
Whoa, whoa! Where are you going?

819
01:18:00,887 --> 01:18:01,888
l got an idea.

820
01:18:02,513 --> 01:18:04,849
We got a few hours until we're arrested.

821
01:18:04,974 --> 01:18:07,894
Stay low. l'm going to get help.

822
01:18:08,019 --> 01:18:09,646
I'II beep you.

823
01:18:12,148 --> 01:18:13,149
Are you coming?

824
01:18:17,654 --> 01:18:19,697
May the Force be with you, man.

825
01:18:48,142 --> 01:18:49,602
There they are!

826
01:18:50,144 --> 01:18:53,523
Razor and BIade?! They're fIakes!

827
01:18:53,690 --> 01:18:57,151
They're elite! Let's get 'em.

828
01:19:49,037 --> 01:19:52,206
Get off the stage, man! Get off!

829
01:20:15,855 --> 01:20:17,315
l lost them!

830
01:20:19,025 --> 01:20:20,318
Where were you?

831
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:37,293
l don't like this.

832
01:20:42,298 --> 01:20:44,550
l definitely don't like this.

833
01:20:44,842 --> 01:20:46,928
What do you want?

834
01:20:50,890 --> 01:20:52,976
We come in peace.

835
01:20:55,103 --> 01:20:57,772
We need your help, if you're up to it.

836
01:20:59,065 --> 01:21:01,276
She's buff. Ballsy.

837
01:21:02,318 --> 01:21:03,361
Let's keep her.

838
01:21:03,528 --> 01:21:04,654
Waste the dude.

839
01:21:11,661 --> 01:21:16,457
A virus called da Vinci will cause
oil spills tomorrow at 10.30AM.

840
01:21:16,833 --> 01:21:19,294
lt's somehow connected to that worm.

841
01:21:19,460 --> 01:21:24,299
We need you to overload the Gibson so
we can kill da Vinci and copy the worm.

842
01:21:24,882 --> 01:21:27,719
She's rabid... but cute.

843
01:21:28,219 --> 01:21:30,888
See, we're very busy.

844
01:21:31,055 --> 01:21:37,145
A TV network that wishes to remain
nameless is interested in our show.

845
01:21:38,062 --> 01:21:39,439
Let's go, Kate.

846
01:21:42,317 --> 01:21:43,693
Wait.

847
01:21:44,569 --> 01:21:46,571
Nobody said no.

848
01:21:47,155 --> 01:21:51,367
But you will need more than
just two media icons like us.

849
01:21:51,909 --> 01:21:52,869
You need an army.

850
01:21:53,036 --> 01:21:58,207
That's it. An eIectronic army.
If I were us,

851
01:21:58,374 --> 01:22:02,253
l'd get on the lnternet,
send out a major distress signal.

852
01:22:02,837 --> 01:22:04,297
Hackers of the world, unite!

853
01:22:04,589 --> 01:22:06,215
How will you take care of the cops?

854
01:22:26,861 --> 01:22:28,363
l'm blowing up!

855
01:22:28,488 --> 01:22:31,074
lt's Kate. Grand Central.
Let's hit it!

856
01:23:39,726 --> 01:23:40,810
You're the man!

857
01:23:41,811 --> 01:23:42,770
You're the man!

858
01:24:03,541 --> 01:24:05,460
Joey, you made it!

859
01:24:09,964 --> 01:24:12,675
Okay. Use your best viruses
to buy us some time.

860
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:14,636
We must get in and copy the worm.

861
01:24:17,180 --> 01:24:19,223
l had to do that to break the tension.

862
01:24:20,099 --> 01:24:22,810
- Cereal. Go fix the phones.
- Roger.

863
01:24:25,063 --> 01:24:26,856
Joey, take his place.

864
01:24:28,066 --> 01:24:29,984
- Me?
- Take his place. Do it.

865
01:24:30,193 --> 01:24:31,611
You can do it.

866
01:24:32,654 --> 01:24:33,655
Ready?

867
01:24:35,365 --> 01:24:36,991
Let's boot up.

868
01:25:32,839 --> 01:25:36,384
- What is it? What's wrong?
- Nothing. Just a minor glitch.

869
01:25:36,509 --> 01:25:39,721
A minor glitch with you seems
to turn into a major catastrophe.

870
01:25:45,893 --> 01:25:47,895
There's a new virus in the database.

871
01:25:48,021 --> 01:25:49,272
What's happening?

872
01:25:49,397 --> 01:25:51,524
lt's eating memory. What do l do?

873
01:25:51,649 --> 01:25:52,817
Type 'cookie', you idiot.

874
01:25:52,942 --> 01:25:54,861
l'll head them off at the pass.

875
01:25:59,115 --> 01:26:01,659
We have a bug attacking all log-in files.

876
01:26:01,784 --> 01:26:04,162
Run anti-virus.
Give me a systems display.

877
01:26:11,502 --> 01:26:13,046
Die, dickweeds!

878
01:26:16,716 --> 01:26:18,301
A rabbit's in the system.

879
01:26:18,426 --> 01:26:19,302
Send a flu shot.

880
01:26:19,427 --> 01:26:22,180
Rabbit? Flu shot? Someone talk to me.

881
01:26:22,305 --> 01:26:26,434
A rabbit replicates till it overloads
a file then spreads like cancer.

882
01:26:26,559 --> 01:26:27,644
Cancer?

883
01:26:28,478 --> 01:26:32,607
Row, row, row your boat

884
01:26:32,732 --> 01:26:35,109
GentIy down the stream.

885
01:26:35,234 --> 01:26:38,154
MerriIy, merriIy, merriIy, merriIy,

886
01:26:38,279 --> 01:26:40,698
Life is but a dream.

887
01:26:42,325 --> 01:26:43,952
Whoa! Falling off!

888
01:26:44,827 --> 01:26:46,579
lt's a Gibson, it's finding us too fast.

889
01:27:02,261 --> 01:27:05,098
There's too many garbage files.
l need more time.

890
01:27:11,813 --> 01:27:16,567
They're at Grand Central station,
lower level. Don't screw up.

891
01:27:16,693 --> 01:27:18,152
Get out of here!

892
01:27:18,278 --> 01:27:21,406
Everyone, let's move! Move it!

893
01:27:21,823 --> 01:27:23,658
Get the hell out of the way! Come on!

894
01:27:23,783 --> 01:27:25,451
Grand Central!

895
01:27:29,747 --> 01:27:33,584
Game's over. Last chance to get out
of this without a prison sentence.

896
01:27:33,710 --> 01:27:35,044
You're not good enough to beat me.

897
01:27:35,169 --> 01:27:38,840
Maybe l'm not. But we are,

898
01:27:38,965 --> 01:27:41,426
- you asshoIe!
- Give it up!

899
01:27:42,510 --> 01:27:45,221
Just give it up.

900
01:27:49,017 --> 01:27:50,476
Are we fashionably late?

901
01:27:56,399 --> 01:27:57,734
Okay, let's go!

902
01:29:04,759 --> 01:29:08,179
We have massive infection.
Multiple GPl viruses...

903
01:29:08,304 --> 01:29:09,555
..from remote nodes.

904
01:29:09,681 --> 01:29:12,183
- They're going for the kernel.
- Colonel who?

905
01:29:12,308 --> 01:29:14,352
The command processor. The brain!

906
01:29:14,477 --> 01:29:16,562
Cancer, brain. Brain cancer!

907
01:29:17,230 --> 01:29:18,356
What's going on?

908
01:29:18,481 --> 01:29:20,858
ln short, Duke, a shitstorm.

909
01:29:22,902 --> 01:29:24,779
Move! Go!

910
01:30:05,945 --> 01:30:07,530
l found it!

911
01:30:08,239 --> 01:30:09,532
l found it!

912
01:30:34,098 --> 01:30:36,559
This is the end, my friend.

913
01:30:38,227 --> 01:30:39,520
Thank you for calling.

914
01:30:43,107 --> 01:30:44,150
Shit!

915
01:30:44,317 --> 01:30:45,610
He got me!

916
01:30:46,277 --> 01:30:47,528
Joey's gettin' stupid busy.

917
01:30:49,030 --> 01:30:52,533
Joey, go after the worm.
You're the closest.

918
01:30:54,035 --> 01:30:57,538
lt's root, slash, period, 'workspace',

919
01:30:57,664 --> 01:31:00,416
slash, period, 'garbage', period.

920
01:31:03,670 --> 01:31:05,254
Out of the way!

921
01:31:08,675 --> 01:31:10,969
Out of the way! Freeze!

922
01:31:14,973 --> 01:31:15,556
Come on!

923
01:31:41,666 --> 01:31:42,375
All right! Wow!

924
01:31:44,252 --> 01:31:45,336
Kill the Gibson!

925
01:31:45,461 --> 01:31:46,462
Roger that.

926
01:31:52,427 --> 01:31:55,388
Come on, you son of a bitch.
ls that all you got?

927
01:31:55,972 --> 01:31:58,391
Come on! Let's see what else you can do.

928
01:31:58,516 --> 01:32:03,438
You talking to me, huh?
Are you nuts? Come at me!

929
01:32:07,150 --> 01:32:08,943
They're in the kernel.

930
01:32:09,068 --> 01:32:10,278
Help me!

931
01:32:12,947 --> 01:32:15,867
The tankers have stopped capsizing.

932
01:32:15,992 --> 01:32:17,744
BaIIast tanks emptying.

933
01:32:17,869 --> 01:32:19,329
Should be okay.

934
01:32:32,508 --> 01:32:34,302
Little pissant!

935
01:32:46,689 --> 01:32:47,690
Yes!

936
01:32:49,984 --> 01:32:51,527
Let's get outta here!

937
01:32:51,653 --> 01:32:52,403
Freeze!

938
01:33:12,465 --> 01:33:14,676
They're trashing our rights, man.

939
01:33:14,842 --> 01:33:17,845
They're trashing the flow of data.

940
01:33:18,012 --> 01:33:19,180
Trashing!

941
01:33:19,472 --> 01:33:20,556
Trashing!

942
01:33:20,848 --> 01:33:21,849
Trashing!

943
01:33:22,767 --> 01:33:24,477
Hack the planet!

944
01:33:24,769 --> 01:33:26,646
- Hack the planet!
- Shut up and get in!

945
01:33:26,813 --> 01:33:28,606
Hack the planet!

946
01:33:28,856 --> 01:33:30,191
Hack the planet!

947
01:33:37,907 --> 01:33:40,118
- Hello.
- We caught them.

948
01:33:40,285 --> 01:33:42,161
- Good.
- Red-handed.

949
01:33:43,121 --> 01:33:45,331
You won't be having
any more trouble from them.

950
01:33:58,720 --> 01:34:03,349
Me, all right? l did it.
She knows shit about computers.

951
01:34:05,059 --> 01:34:06,769
She's just my girlfriend.

952
01:34:09,606 --> 01:34:12,066
l suggest you modify your attitude,

953
01:34:12,191 --> 01:34:13,901
because you are floating

954
01:34:14,027 --> 01:34:15,820
and l am about to flush your ass.

955
01:34:17,488 --> 01:34:20,658
Mrs Murphy is here to see you, sir.

956
01:34:27,957 --> 01:34:30,918
- Are you crazy? What are you doing?
- Trying to help you.

957
01:34:37,425 --> 01:34:39,135
- Dade.
- What?

958
01:34:40,511 --> 01:34:41,596
Thanks for your help.

959
01:34:48,102 --> 01:34:50,229
Your son is in big trouble.

960
01:34:50,563 --> 01:34:54,943
He violated his probation and
has engaged in criminal activities.

961
01:34:55,818 --> 01:34:58,029
My son happens to be a genius.

962
01:34:58,154 --> 01:35:02,283
He understands things that you won't
comprehend if you live to be 100.

963
01:35:02,408 --> 01:35:05,036
He would never use his knowledge
to harm others.

964
01:35:05,161 --> 01:35:07,205
The news crew you requested is here.

965
01:35:07,330 --> 01:35:09,457
Good. l have some things to tell them.

966
01:35:09,707 --> 01:35:13,544
Your son is facing 30 felony counts
in an ongoing investigation.

967
01:35:13,711 --> 01:35:16,089
You face arrest if you do that.

968
01:35:16,214 --> 01:35:18,007
l don't care if l face certain death.

969
01:35:18,132 --> 01:35:20,843
Mrs Murphy stays right here.

970
01:35:22,887 --> 01:35:24,764
Wow. She's great.

971
01:35:26,266 --> 01:35:26,933
Yeah.

972
01:35:29,602 --> 01:35:30,770
..and attacked the EIIingson network.

973
01:35:30,937 --> 01:35:34,023
Is this the Iast we've seen
of this kind ofespionage?

974
01:35:35,191 --> 01:35:38,278
No. Hackers are a grave threat
to the national security.

975
01:35:38,403 --> 01:35:41,364
This incident just proves
that we need

976
01:35:41,489 --> 01:35:44,033
- increased funding to stop...
- We're getting interference.

977
01:35:44,200 --> 01:35:46,494
HoIa, boys and girIs.
It is I, CereaI KiIIer,

978
01:35:46,619 --> 01:35:51,791
making my first worIdwide
gIobaI teIevision appearance.

979
01:35:52,375 --> 01:35:54,627
Yes, that's right.

980
01:35:54,794 --> 01:35:58,298
I'm here to teII you about this heinous
scheme hatched within EIIingson MineraI.

981
01:35:59,382 --> 01:36:00,216
But for what?

982
01:36:00,383 --> 01:36:02,927
WorId domination? Nay.

983
01:36:03,094 --> 01:36:06,389
Something far more tacky.

984
01:36:06,848 --> 01:36:12,604
A virus caIIed da Vinci, that wouId cause
EIIingson tankers to capsize,

985
01:36:12,729 --> 01:36:17,442
was to be bIamed on innocent hackers.
This virus was reaIIy a smokescreen.

986
01:36:17,567 --> 01:36:24,407
What couId be so important to protect
that someone wouId create such a nasty,

987
01:36:24,532 --> 01:36:27,368
anti-sociaI, uncooI virus program?

988
01:36:27,493 --> 01:36:28,578
But why?

989
01:36:29,120 --> 01:36:31,664
CouId it be to cover the tracks
of this worm program?

990
01:36:31,789 --> 01:36:34,876
A worm that was to steaI 25 miIIion bucks.

991
01:36:35,126 --> 01:36:38,046
The password for this worm
beIongs to Margo WaIIace,

992
01:36:38,171 --> 01:36:41,215
- head ofPubIic ReIations at EIIingson.
- Oh, my God!

993
01:36:41,341 --> 01:36:43,259
And Eugene BeIford,

994
01:36:43,384 --> 01:36:46,888
- computer security officer.
- Son of a bitch!

995
01:36:47,555 --> 01:36:52,435
What's this? The account in the Bahamas
where the money was to be stashed?

996
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:53,645
I think so.

997
01:36:53,770 --> 01:36:55,521
Unlucky!

998
01:36:57,398 --> 01:36:58,566
Yo.

999
01:36:58,691 --> 01:37:00,568
I kinda feeI Iike God.

1000
01:37:05,782 --> 01:37:07,116
Plague?

1001
01:37:09,619 --> 01:37:10,620
Eugene?

1002
01:37:21,047 --> 01:37:26,761
l don't even know how to work the VCR
let alone a computer. Get off!

1003
01:37:26,886 --> 01:37:32,725
Listen, l'll make a deal. Eugene Belford.
l know where his mother is.

1004
01:37:32,850 --> 01:37:35,311
Get off me! l need a lawyer!

1005
01:37:45,905 --> 01:37:47,865
Here you are, Mr Babbage.

1006
01:37:47,991 --> 01:37:52,078
Flight time to Tokyo is 14 hours.
Can l get you anything else?

1007
01:37:52,203 --> 01:37:54,580
Just a pillow, please.

1008
01:38:00,920 --> 01:38:02,005
Thank you.

1009
01:38:04,465 --> 01:38:06,301
You're welcome.

1010
01:38:06,426 --> 01:38:09,137
What's going on? Let go of me!
Stewardess!

1011
01:38:09,262 --> 01:38:11,973
l'll never fly this airline again!

1012
01:38:22,525 --> 01:38:24,652
You look good in a dress.

1013
01:38:25,737 --> 01:38:27,614
You would have looked better.

1014
01:38:34,370 --> 01:38:36,247
Wanna go for a swim?

1015
01:38:46,966 --> 01:38:49,969
l can't believe they decided you won.

1016
01:38:50,970 --> 01:38:55,350
They didn't. The guys felt it was
the only way l'd get a date.

1017
01:38:58,561 --> 01:38:59,729
Anyway,

1018
01:39:01,522 --> 01:39:03,232
you're pretty good.

1019
01:39:03,608 --> 01:39:05,068
You're elite.

1020
01:39:06,819 --> 01:39:07,987
Yeah?

1021
01:39:08,529 --> 01:39:13,242
lf you'd said that at the start,
you would have avoided a lot of trouble.

1022
01:39:25,338 --> 01:39:26,798
Beat that!

1023
01:39:40,395 --> 01:39:41,604
You know,

1024
01:39:43,564 --> 01:39:47,485
- l've been having these weird...
- ..dreams.
