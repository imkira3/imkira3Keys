00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,600
The universe...

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,230
A vast expanse of space and matter.

3
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:14,020
It includes all that we see
and all that we know.

4
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:18,900
Since the beginning of time,
we wonder how it came to be.

5
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:24,120
A gloriously orchestrated plan,
a chance of series of events?

6
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:28,270
Or something much, much double?

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,074

00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:18,820
Let my mammals pass...!

9
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,600
This never gonna work.

10
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,560
The ancients grant us safe passage.

11
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,900
Sweet!

12
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,720
Aww... The air feels strange.

13
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,850
Diego?

14
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,020
What?

15
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,450
The black hole.

16
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:16,740
No piece of cosmic garbage is too small,

17
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:20,810
too insignificant or too pathetic,
to escape its mighty...

18
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:24,570
Ohh... Never mind...

19
00:14:25,305 --> 00:15:25,845
