<i>[ Bell Chiming ]</i>

3
00:00:35,077 --> 00:00:37,300
France... The 17th Century...

4
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:42,229
The English and the Spanish were threatening
war... A war that France could not win.

5
00:00:42,278 --> 00:00:47,025
King Louis XIII was a weak man... and he was
easily manipulated by the head of the Catholic Church...

6
00:00:47,049 --> 00:00:49,070
...Cardinal Richelieu

7
00:00:49,094 --> 00:00:54,523
Richelieu built his own army of Cardinal's Guards
to fortify his power. The only thing

8
00:00:54,547 --> 00:00:57,976
standing in his way was the King's brave and loyal force,

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,342
...The Musketeers.

Okay. Whew.
Ohh!

12
00:01:14,792 --> 00:01:17,022
Yeah. You went
on the defensive too soon.

13
00:01:17,127 --> 00:01:20,427
Ah, you gave too much ground.
A Musketeer would never do that.

14
00:01:20,531 --> 00:01:24,399
A Musketeer doesn't fight his duels
after a morning of farm chores.

15
00:01:24,502 --> 00:01:28,598
No, but they drink and carouse all
night. So it's much the same thing.

16
00:01:28,706 --> 00:01:31,732
Time to eat.
<i>Don't fill his head with that.</i>

17
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:35,278
D'Artagnan wishes to serve his king
as the bravest of Musketeers.

18
00:01:35,379 --> 00:01:38,747
Well, I might have a drink
now and then. [ Chuckles ]

- [ Chuckles]
- Riders coming.

but you're welcome to share it.

You don't recognize me,
Gaston?

23
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,028
Not since you no longer
wear the colors of the King.

24
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:03,507
Are you the son?

25
00:02:03,607 --> 00:02:06,269
You know your father was
quite a swordsman at one time.

26
00:02:06,377 --> 00:02:08,846
- The best in Europe.
- Second best.

27
00:02:08,946 --> 00:02:12,712
- He's second to no one.
- He is no one but a cripple.

Leave now.

29
00:02:16,287 --> 00:02:20,281
Not without the taxes.
<i>I've paid my taxes to the King.</i>

30
00:02:20,391 --> 00:02:22,359
Oh, that does the Church
no good at all.

31
00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:25,019
Taxes for the King,
taxes for the Church,

32
00:02:25,129 --> 00:02:28,030
taxes for the sheriff,
taxes for the mayor.

33
00:02:28,132 --> 00:02:29,964
It's a wonder there is
anything left to eat.

34
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:33,560
Does it look like
I've struck gold here?

35
00:02:33,671 --> 00:02:37,733
Such insolence...
from a thief.

36
00:02:37,841 --> 00:02:40,708
- My father is not a thief.
- D'Artagnan! Please.

37
00:02:42,346 --> 00:02:46,874
Listen to your mother,
and listen to me.

38
00:02:46,984 --> 00:02:49,976
A man who does not pay his taxes
is no more than a thief.

39
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:53,022
- My father was a Musketeer.
- I know.

40

Not here.

I've heard otherwise.
You've heard wrong.

42
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:04,591

Planchet will take
care of you.

46
00:03:59,289 --> 00:04:03,453
I do not hope to replace
your parents. No one can.

47
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,188
However, I would like to
help you in becoming a man.

48
00:04:06,296 --> 00:04:09,027
It's a rather
tricky journey.

49
00:04:09,133 --> 00:04:11,932
I will be your guide.

50
00:04:14,705 --> 00:04:17,402
I want you to teach me
to become a Musketeer,

51
00:04:17,508 --> 00:04:19,670
like you taught my father.

52
00:04:19,777 --> 00:04:22,644
I will find that man
and kill him.

53
00:04:22,746 --> 00:04:27,183
Listen to me, D'Artagnan.
Listen to me carefully.

54
00:04:27,284 --> 00:04:31,016
I didn't teach your father how
to kill. I taught him how to live.

55
00:04:31,121 --> 00:04:35,752
I don't understand.
That's because you're a boy.

56
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:38,760
You have always
had your father in you.

57
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:41,593
I can see it in your eyes.

58
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:43,599
You will become a Musketeer.

59

A great one.
Understand...

60
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:52,203
it will not happen quickly, and
it will only happen if you listen.

61
00:04:52,309 --> 00:04:56,041
If you teach me,
I will listen.

62
00:04:58,716 --> 00:05:01,617
I'd be honored.

Whoa. Whoa.

for bad food and worse company.

will strengthen his position with the people.

It doesn't have to be like this.
We can get along much better.

458
00:44:21,810 --> 00:44:23,904
I'll take my chances
with the Cardinal.

459
00:44:27,682 --> 00:44:31,812
Oh, that's better. That's
more like it-- [ Groans ]

460
00:44:33,988 --> 00:44:37,856
Remember... we're family.
That sad fact...

461
00:44:37,959 --> 00:44:40,360
is all that
keeps you alive.

462
00:44:40,462 --> 00:44:42,362
Up!

463
00:44:42,464 --> 00:44:46,560
My-My dear niece, may I
say something? No. Just listen.

464
00:44:46,668 --> 00:44:49,535
If you ever
touch me again,

465
00:44:49,637 --> 00:44:52,538
threaten me again
or hit me again,

466
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:56,304
I will slice off your balls
and feed them to the pigs.

467
00:44:56,411 --> 00:44:58,937
Do you understand me?

468
00:44:59,047 --> 00:45:04,508
[ Gasps ] Yes-Yes. Very clear.
You explained it quite well.

469
00:45:06,788 --> 00:45:09,758
Get out!

470
00:45:13,394 --> 00:45:17,126
[ Crying ]

471
00:46:17,292 --> 00:46:19,351
You wanted to see me?

472
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:21,827
I am your humble servant,
D'Artagnan.

473
00:46:23,698 --> 00:46:26,030
I've heard about you,
Monsieur D'Artagnan,

474
00:46:26,134 --> 00:46:28,501
and nothing I've heard
suggests you're humble.

475
00:46:28,603 --> 00:46:30,697
Monsieur Rochefort
will not be joining us.

476
00:46:33,041 --> 00:46:35,408
Who are you,
D'Artagnan?

477
00:46:35,510 --> 00:46:39,003
Where are you from?

478
00:46:39,113 --> 00:46:41,605
What do you want?

479
00:46:41,716 --> 00:46:44,913
I even want to know your
philosophical and political leanings.

480
00:46:45,019 --> 00:46:49,855
I don't have any. You'd best acquire some
quickly, if you're to survive in Paris.

481
00:46:49,958 --> 00:46:52,859
Is that why you wish to see
me, to pass along advice?

482
00:46:52,961 --> 00:46:56,955
Fires are erupting all over
France. Last night, for example.

483
00:46:57,065 --> 00:47:00,660
I'm sure you'll be glad to know that I
subdued the peasants without further incident.

484
00:47:00,768 --> 00:47:04,636
And how did you deal with the ones
who were not peasants? You confuse me.

485
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:07,470
The men I confronted were
well-armed and fought like swordsmen.

486
00:47:07,575 --> 00:47:09,509
Even swordsmen can be poor.

487
00:47:09,611 --> 00:47:11,841
Do you know why France
has come to this?

488
00:47:14,582 --> 00:47:17,210
The King, poor man,
is weak.

489
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:21,016
The Queen is manipulative.

490
00:47:21,122 --> 00:47:25,423
The Spanish and the English are
opportunistic. The Protestants are divisive.

491
00:47:25,526 --> 00:47:28,655
The nobles are scared
and the peasants are impatient.

492
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:31,255
Well, I thought they were
just cold and hungry.

493
00:47:31,366 --> 00:47:35,132
If that were so, we could just give
them hot soup and be done with it.

494
00:47:43,011 --> 00:47:45,605
Understand me. There
will be a shift in power,

495
00:47:45,713 --> 00:47:47,738
and with that,
a shift in wealth.

496
00:47:47,849 --> 00:47:49,977
Those who do not join me
will be against me.

497
00:47:50,084 --> 00:47:52,553
They will be swept away with the King.
That includes your friends, the Musketeers.

498
00:47:52,654 --> 00:47:55,919
I will be sure to tell them.
I'm counting on that.

499
00:47:56,024 --> 00:47:59,324
-How is it you have their trust?
- I helped them free Treville.

500
00:47:59,427 --> 00:48:01,623
Such honesty.

501
00:48:01,729 --> 00:48:03,720
Such stupidity.

502
00:48:03,831 --> 00:48:06,994
I assumed Your Eminence
was not aware Treville was jailed.

503
00:48:07,101 --> 00:48:10,298
I mean, why would it be
important to jail an old man...

504
00:48:10,405 --> 00:48:13,466
when the impression it would give is
that Your Eminence was frightened of him?

505
00:48:13,574 --> 00:48:16,407
And, of course, why give
the Musketeers a martyr?

506
00:48:16,511 --> 00:48:18,980
Of course.

507
00:48:21,316 --> 00:48:23,842
For a man who does not
have a political position,

508
00:48:23,951 --> 00:48:26,921
you think remarkably
like a politician.

509
00:48:33,528 --> 00:48:35,758
Men without greed
make me nervous.

510
00:48:38,266 --> 00:48:40,826
This is someone
who will bear watching.

511
00:48:40,935 --> 00:48:43,267
Or eliminating.

512
00:48:43,371 --> 00:48:46,534
I think he's the most
dangerous kind of man.

513
00:48:46,641 --> 00:48:49,269
He's young
and he has a cause.

514
00:48:49,377 --> 00:48:52,438
He will serve me
or he will serve no one.

515
00:48:52,547 --> 00:48:57,212
I think you should kill him now,
before he causes more trouble.

516
00:48:57,318 --> 00:48:59,650
You've barely washed
the blood from your teeth...

517
00:48:59,754 --> 00:49:03,281
and you hunger for more.
Call it a weakness.

518
00:49:03,391 --> 00:49:05,450
I want him alive,
for the moment.

519
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:08,393
After last night,
he's in the King's good grace.

520
00:49:08,496 --> 00:49:13,229
When the time is right and the King
can do no harm, I will let you have him.

521
00:49:13,334 --> 00:49:17,271
- When? Will it be soon?
-Yes.

522
00:49:18,806 --> 00:49:20,706
Good.

523
00:49:20,808 --> 00:49:23,834
[ Yelling ]

524
00:49:49,537 --> 00:49:52,734
[ Treville] The Cardinal is not satisfied
with suspending the Musketeers,

525
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:55,901
now he has to arrest them; I will
not stand by while this happens.

526
00:49:56,010 --> 00:49:59,412
- This is not necessary.
- Or wise.

527
00:49:59,514 --> 00:50:02,575
What is not wise
is hiding here,

528
00:50:02,683 --> 00:50:06,176
letting Cardinal Richelieu
dictate what I do.

529
00:50:06,287 --> 00:50:09,746
[ Sighs ] I will no longer
cower in this place.

530
00:50:09,857 --> 00:50:12,383
Then Richelieu will have you
cowering in one of his jails instead.

531
00:50:12,493 --> 00:50:17,192
Aramis, I do not intend
to cower at all.

532
00:50:17,298 --> 00:50:19,892
If they want
to put me in jail,

533
00:50:20,001 --> 00:50:21,901
if they want
to hang me,

534
00:50:22,003 --> 00:50:24,199
so be it.

535
00:50:24,305 --> 00:50:26,569
I will no longer hide.

536
00:50:43,791 --> 00:50:46,158
Your Majesty, Buckingham
has left for England...

537
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:48,888
after the fiasco at the banquet.

538
00:50:48,996 --> 00:50:50,725
The situation with the English
grows more...

539
00:50:52,133 --> 00:50:54,192
intense.

540
00:50:55,603 --> 00:50:58,766
If you will excuse us.

541
00:50:58,873 --> 00:51:02,867
The concerns of the Crown
are my concerns as well.

542
00:51:02,977 --> 00:51:06,242
- We do not wish to trouble you.
- I assure you...

543
00:51:06,347 --> 00:51:10,580
if anything can help keep peace,
it's not troubling.

544
00:51:10,685 --> 00:51:12,585
I think there is still
an opportunity--

545
00:51:12,687 --> 00:51:15,088
The role of the Queen
is not to think.

546
00:51:17,458 --> 00:51:21,088
- But if I could explain-- - The
Queen wishes to return to her chamber.

547
00:51:31,606 --> 00:51:34,507
I would not presume to dictate
the behavior of the Queen,

548
00:51:34,609 --> 00:51:37,476
but she grows
more strong-willed.

549
00:51:37,578 --> 00:51:39,478
It does you
an injustice.

550
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:43,346
- I will deal with her.
- I'm certain that you will.

Your Highness.

552

Most of the Musketeers are in
the cells back here and here.

Most of the Musketeers are in
the cells back here and here.

554
00:51:50,424 --> 00:51:52,859
At dawn,
they change guards.

555
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:55,258
The hour before,
they'd be most vulnerable.

556

[Man] They'll expect it.
They're counting on it.

I need your help. Yes,
of course. Anything.

Please, come with me.
Where?

00:52:28,062 --> 00:52:32,295
We escort the Queen. She visits
Buckingham, a last plea to avert war.

00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,494
Won't the King's Guards
escort her?

565
00:52:34,602 --> 00:52:37,537
No, the King does not know.
Richelieu does not know.

566

No one must know.
Not now, not later.

567

I must have your
word on that. You have.

in the company of commoners.

Oh, how fortunate
we're so common.

No, I-I-- You betrayed
your own flesh and blood.

If I do not come back

I'm coming back for you.
[ Whimpering ]

I'm afraid you're going
to regret we ever met.

Well, it would be nice
