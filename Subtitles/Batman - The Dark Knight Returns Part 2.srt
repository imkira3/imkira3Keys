1
00:00:04,464 --> 00:00:07,801
<i>Today marks three months
since Batman's defeat of the Mutant leader...</i>

2
00:00:07,967 --> 00:00:09,678
<i>... at the West River drainage site.</i>

3
00:00:09,844 --> 00:00:12,639
<i>The Mutants have adopted
Batman's methods as their own...</i>

4
00:00:12,806 --> 00:00:15,266
<i>... leading to a series of brutal attacks
on criminals.</i>

5
00:00:15,433 --> 00:00:17,394
<i>So psychopaths go after bad guys?</i>

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,854
<i>Who cares?
Why blame Batman, for chrissakes?</i>

7
00:00:20,021 --> 00:00:22,482
<i>And in these strange times, people ask:</i>

8
00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:25,276
<i>"Has Gotham traded one evil
for another?"</i>

9
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,616
<i>This is the face of the future.
Let Gotham's criminals beware.</i>

10
00:00:31,783 --> 00:00:34,411
<i>Gotham City belongs to the Batman.</i>

11
00:00:34,577 --> 00:00:37,789
<i>That statement came from the self-named
Sons of Batman...</i>

12
00:00:37,956 --> 00:00:41,251
<i>... shortly after the body of a known
drug dealer was found murdered...</i>

13
00:00:41,418 --> 00:00:44,838
<i>... in an East Side tenement.
One of several splinter groups that formed...</i>

14
00:00:45,004 --> 00:00:48,258
<i>... from the Mutant gang after their leader
was defeated by the Batman.</i>

15
00:00:48,425 --> 00:00:49,467
<i>They're using his name.</i>

16
00:00:49,634 --> 00:00:52,929
<i>He could at least release a clear statement
against what they're doing.</i>

17
00:00:53,096 --> 00:00:56,558
<i>The Batman doesn't exactly come out
with statements to the press.</i>

18
00:00:56,725 --> 00:00:59,310
<i>No, he can't, because he's an outlaw.</i>

19
00:00:59,477 --> 00:01:01,730
<i>How are the Sons of Batman
his responsibility?</i>

20
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:04,649
- <i>He didn't create them.</i>
- <i>He absolutely did.</i>

21
00:01:04,816 --> 00:01:07,736
<i>They exist because
Batman broke up the larger gang.</i>

22
00:01:07,902 --> 00:01:09,237
<i>And we're better off for it.</i>

23
00:01:09,404 --> 00:01:12,115
<i>Would you prefer the Mutant leader
still be running things?</i>

24
00:01:12,282 --> 00:01:14,159
<i>This Sons of Batman thing is exactly...</i>

25
00:01:14,325 --> 00:01:17,537
<i>... why we didn't want these
costumed heroes around 10 years ago...</i>

26
00:01:17,704 --> 00:01:19,664
<i>... and why Batman
shouldn't have come back.</i>

27
00:01:19,831 --> 00:01:21,791
<i>Because of their effect on our youth...</i>

28
00:01:21,958 --> 00:01:25,503
<i>... on the public, on the media,
you get copycats.</i>

29
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:30,008
I see my favorite patient is up and about.
Just super to see how well you're doing.

30
00:01:30,175 --> 00:01:34,179
- For years it seemed like you didn't have...
- A reason to go on.

31
00:01:34,429 --> 00:01:35,680
Exactly.

32
00:01:35,847 --> 00:01:39,100
- I saw you on the TV last night.
- Oh, that.

33
00:01:39,267 --> 00:01:41,728
I get invited on the talk-show circuit
now and then.

34
00:01:41,895 --> 00:01:45,523
Must be wonderful to get to tell
your side of things.

35
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:49,360
I know the world has every reason
to hate me.

36
00:01:49,527 --> 00:01:53,531
Don't say that.
I always say, "Hate never heals."

37
00:01:53,698 --> 00:01:57,243
But it's so disheartening.

38
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:06,336
<i>I wish Batman could go public,
but the police...</i>

39
00:02:06,503 --> 00:02:09,881
I bet I could arrange an appearance for you
on one of the shows.

40
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,966
The home would have to approve
a day pass.

41
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:15,553
They'll insist I be right beside you
at all times, even on-stage.

42
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,557
Oh, please.
No one wants to hear from me.

43
00:02:19,724 --> 00:02:22,060
I think they'll fight for the chance
to book you.

44
00:02:22,227 --> 00:02:24,521
I'll make some calls right now.

45
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:28,149
<i>What I think we should do is trust Batman...</i>

46
00:02:28,316 --> 00:02:31,903
<i>... at least for the time being.
He's saved us before.</i>

47
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:35,323
<i>Public uproar over</i>
The Dave Endochrine Show's <i>announcement...</i>

48
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:38,243
<i>... that Joker will be appearing
as a guest this week...</i>

49
00:02:38,409 --> 00:02:40,036
<i>... while media analysts predict...</i>

50
00:02:40,203 --> 00:02:43,206
<i>... it'll be Endochrine's
highest-rated episode in years.</i>

51
00:02:43,373 --> 00:02:46,668
<i>Meanwhile, the White House
continues to decline comment on...</i>

52
00:02:46,835 --> 00:02:48,586
<i>... the Batman's renewed activities...</i>

53
00:02:48,753 --> 00:02:51,714
<i>... and the suggestion
that his defiance is an embarrassment...</i>

54
00:02:51,881 --> 00:02:53,591
<i>... to the current administration.</i>

55
00:02:53,758 --> 00:02:55,844
<i>A White House spokesman
only volunteered...</i>

56
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,513
<i>... that the president would deal
with the situation...</i>

57
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,766
<i>... if and when appropriate
and in his own way.</i>

58
00:03:01,933 --> 00:03:06,229
Son, you know
I like to keep you out of domestic affairs...

59
00:03:06,396 --> 00:03:09,274
- ... what with all the ruckus you stir up.
- Yes, sir.

60
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,776
But, well, it's a ruckus...

61
00:03:11,943 --> 00:03:13,611
... I'd like you to straighten out.

62
00:03:13,778 --> 00:03:16,281
Involving a friend of yours
in Gotham City.

63
00:03:16,447 --> 00:03:20,702
It's all well and good to have
a wild bronco on the ranch now and then.

64
00:03:20,869 --> 00:03:23,121
Does the hands good to break him in.

65
00:03:23,288 --> 00:03:26,249
But if the bronco up
and kicks over the fence...

66
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:28,793
... and gets all the other horses crazy...

67
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,380
- ... well, that's bad for business.
- I understand, sir.

68
00:03:32,547 --> 00:03:37,385
Now, I'm not asking you to put him down.
Not yet, anyway. But settle him.

69
00:03:37,552 --> 00:03:40,638
Ride him around the yard
a few times if you have to.

70
00:03:40,805 --> 00:03:44,309
- You know what I'm asking.
- Sir, I can talk to him but...

71
00:03:44,475 --> 00:03:47,520
I'd just hate for things to get out of hand.

72
00:03:47,687 --> 00:03:50,231
You know, how to get in touch with him,
don't you, son?

73
00:03:50,398 --> 00:03:54,319
- He's not hard to find, sir.
- Good boy.

74
00:04:04,495 --> 00:04:06,331
- What are you?
- We Bruno's.

75
00:04:06,497 --> 00:04:07,832
We nasty.

76
00:04:07,999 --> 00:04:09,834
Bruno? Who's he?

77
00:04:12,003 --> 00:04:16,049
- Bruno is a she.
- Ha. Big she.

78
00:04:16,215 --> 00:04:17,675
Kind of my nasty.

79
00:04:17,842 --> 00:04:19,093
Aces, Don.

80
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,388
Bruno Joker's squeeze.
He billy berserkest ever.

81
00:04:22,555 --> 00:04:25,516
Yeah. Joker king of the billy.

82
00:04:25,767 --> 00:04:28,436
Eh. Maybe he make us Jokers.

83
00:04:28,603 --> 00:04:31,356
You Mutant kids go from
one boss to the next.

84
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:35,652
- Too young to make your own decisions?
- We not kids. We make decisions.

85
00:04:35,818 --> 00:04:38,738
- You even old enough to drink?
- Course we drink.

86
00:04:38,905 --> 00:04:42,367
We slicer-dicers. We prove it.

87
00:04:56,506 --> 00:04:58,049
Guess you're Bruno.

88
00:04:58,216 --> 00:05:01,010
Those two morons don't have a brain
between them.

89
00:05:01,177 --> 00:05:03,221
So I'm gonna give them yours.

90
00:05:03,388 --> 00:05:05,223
All over their suits.

91
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:07,433
Thief! You're a thief!

92
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,853
Store on Seventh Street sells this for 2.50.

93
00:05:14,482 --> 00:05:15,984
Lady spud mine, Rob.

94
00:05:18,403 --> 00:05:19,862
I need the points.

95
00:06:06,034 --> 00:06:08,202
Hey, Bats! Bruno's taking off.

96
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:17,295
Pull that trigger and I'll be back for you.

97
00:06:20,465 --> 00:06:23,426
<i>Pull that trigger and I'll be back for you.</i>

98
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:30,391
Bruno's heading your way.

99
00:06:30,558 --> 00:06:32,643
<i>Lead her into the alley. Don't let her see you.</i>

100
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:35,688
<i>Violate that order and you're fired.</i>

101
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:40,902
Oh, yes.

102
00:07:21,067 --> 00:07:23,528
If you're lucky, Bruno,
you'll end up in jail tonight.

103
00:07:35,164 --> 00:07:38,876
But first you're gonna tell me what
Joker has planned for his TV appearance.

104
00:08:11,784 --> 00:08:12,910
Somebody do something.

105
00:08:14,245 --> 00:08:16,747
- There's a train coming!
- Do something!

106
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:21,377
There's one more. It's coming!

107
00:08:41,731 --> 00:08:43,608
Tell me what Joker's planning.

108
00:08:45,693 --> 00:08:49,113
No. Not him. Not now.

109
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,307
What is this? Unh.

110
00:09:24,273 --> 00:09:27,485
- We have to talk.
- I'm busy.

111
00:09:27,652 --> 00:09:31,822
My place, in the morning.
Until then, stay out of my way.

112
00:09:38,454 --> 00:09:40,665
Was that him?

113
00:09:48,464 --> 00:09:52,468
<i>Soviet representatives stormed out of talks
over the conflict in Corto Maltese today...</i>

114
00:09:52,677 --> 00:09:56,681
<i>... calling American military presence
in the region pure fascist aggression...</i>

115
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:59,725
<i>... and pledging total military commitment
to ousting the U. S...</i>

116
00:09:59,892 --> 00:10:01,811
<i>... from the Latin American island nation.</i>

117
00:10:01,978 --> 00:10:05,690
<i>Well, all that sounds like to me
is the bluster of bullies.</i>

118
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:08,985
<i>And we don't back down from bullies.
No, sir, we don't.</i>

119
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:11,112
<i>Mr. President!</i>

120
00:10:12,989 --> 00:10:15,658
<i>How about that smartly dressed youngster
in the front row?</i>

121
00:10:15,825 --> 00:10:18,869
<i>Mr. President, what's your position
on the Batman controversy?</i>

122
00:10:19,036 --> 00:10:22,456
<i>It was our understanding the government
reached an arrangement with him...</i>

123
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:25,293
<i>... and his colleagues years ago
to cease their activities.</i>

124
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,670
<i>Doesn't his return defy that arrangement?</i>

125
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:32,049
<i>Well, can't say I know
what arrangement you're talking about.</i>

126
00:10:32,216 --> 00:10:36,137
<i>But as for what's going on in Gotham,
it's not my row to hoe, now is it?</i>

127
00:10:36,304 --> 00:10:39,181
<i>That's a matter for the state level,
and they've got a solid...</i>

128
00:10:39,348 --> 00:10:41,392
<i>... clearheaded governor there,
yes, they do.</i>

129
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:44,312
<i>Sorry, guys,
I've got a whole state to run...</i>

130
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:47,189
<i>... and I trust the judgment
of Mayor Stevenson on that.</i>

131
00:10:47,565 --> 00:10:51,235
<i>My job is to administrate,
not render moral judgments.</i>

132
00:10:51,402 --> 00:10:53,696
<i>We've just appointed
a new police commissioner...</i>

133
00:10:53,863 --> 00:10:55,489
<i>... and I'm not about to interfere.</i>

134
00:10:55,948 --> 00:10:59,910
<i>The job will officially change hands from
outgoing Commissioner James Gordon...</i>

135
00:11:00,077 --> 00:11:03,414
<i>... to incoming Ellen Yindel
at a formal dinner this evening.</i>

136
00:11:03,581 --> 00:11:06,500
<i>Neither has commented yet
on Ms. Yindel's plans.</i>

137
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:24,393
To try to quote Ellen Yindel's
outstanding record in the time I have...

138
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,103
... would do her a disservice.

139
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:29,190
Instead I offer the new commissioner
my sympathy...

140
00:11:29,357 --> 00:11:32,526
... knowing the impossible job
she is about to face.

141
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:36,864
The life-and-death decisions.
The city of thieves and murderers...

142
00:11:37,031 --> 00:11:40,785
... and honest people too afraid to hope.

143
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:44,413
Recently, a man returned
to the public eye...

144
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:48,417
... who refuses to do nothing
while chaos runs rampant.

145
00:11:48,584 --> 00:11:53,464
A man who shows us
we can seize our city back from fear.

146
00:11:53,631 --> 00:11:56,801
Many have asked
how I can condone this man.

147
00:11:56,967 --> 00:12:01,889
My answer is that we all have something,
or someone, worth fighting for.

148
00:12:02,056 --> 00:12:03,808
I have my wife, Sarah.

149
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:06,644
Any time I wonder
if I'm doing the right thing...

150
00:12:06,811 --> 00:12:09,480
... I think of Sarah, and the rest is easy.

151
00:12:10,022 --> 00:12:13,317
Now it's Commissioner Yindel's turn
to face this man.

152
00:12:13,484 --> 00:12:17,530
She may make him her enemy,
or maybe she'll learn from him.

153
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:20,866
Either way, I wish her well.

154
00:12:26,997 --> 00:12:27,998
Thank you.

155
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:31,585
James Gordon dedicated his life
to keeping this city safe...

156
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:34,422
... and I'm honored
to share a stage with him.

157
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:39,510
But this office will no longer tolerate
the actions of a criminal.

158
00:12:39,677 --> 00:12:44,849
As my first official act as commissioner,
on the charges of breaking and entering...

159
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:48,102
... assault and battery,
and creating a public menace...

160
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:51,814
... I hereby issue a warrant
for the Batman's arrest.

161
00:13:04,702 --> 00:13:07,204
You cost me hours of work last night.

162
00:13:07,371 --> 00:13:10,541
Then I'll get right to it.
You have to go back into retirement.

163
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:12,293
You're upsetting too many people.

164
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,961
Mm-hm.

165
00:13:14,128 --> 00:13:17,965
Why do you always have to be like this?
You played right into their hands last time.

166
00:13:18,132 --> 00:13:21,385
When the parents groups came after us,
you're the one they pointed to.

167
00:13:21,552 --> 00:13:22,636
You act like a criminal.

168
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:26,974
Heh, we are criminals, Clark.
We always have been.

169
00:13:27,141 --> 00:13:30,811
You're still one too.
Only difference is you have a boss.

170
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:34,899
And you answer to no one.

171
00:13:36,859 --> 00:13:39,111
You know, we almost
had this talk 10 years ago...

172
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:41,697
... when you wouldn't go along
with the deal we made.

173
00:13:41,864 --> 00:13:44,325
Everyone else agreed.
Diana went back to her people...

174
00:13:44,492 --> 00:13:45,868
... Hal left the planet.

175
00:13:46,035 --> 00:13:48,078
And Oliver? Did he agree?

176
00:13:50,331 --> 00:13:51,916
That's not how I wanted that to go.

177
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:54,043
He was all torn up about it too.

178
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:57,922
- He made it necessary. Like...
- Like I'm about to?

179
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:03,010
- Do you even remember why you retired?
- I remember.

180
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:07,556
Look. Either shut it down or
one of these days someone with authority...

181
00:14:07,723 --> 00:14:09,475
... is gonna tell me to come stop you.

182
00:14:09,642 --> 00:14:11,936
- And when that happens...
- When that happens...

183
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:13,854
... may the best man win.

184
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:17,024
I have to go. We'll finish this later.

185
00:14:22,905 --> 00:14:25,032
No hurry.

186
00:14:25,616 --> 00:14:29,328
<i>Brave American forces
are now engaged in direct combat...</i>

187
00:14:29,495 --> 00:14:32,581
<i>... with Soviet troops in Corto Maltese.</i>

188
00:14:32,748 --> 00:14:36,627
<i>Now, those Soviets would like to see us
turn our tails and run.</i>

189
00:14:36,794 --> 00:14:41,257
<i>But we've got to protect our interest...
I mean, stand up for freedom...</i>

190
00:14:41,423 --> 00:14:43,551
<i>... and the good people of Corto Maltese.</i>

191
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:47,263
<i>So don't you fret.
We've got God on our side.</i>

192
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:50,349
<i>Or the next best thing, anyway.</i>

193
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:19,837
<i>We got a sweet show tonight, folks.
Dr. Ruth Heizraumer...</i>

194
00:15:20,004 --> 00:15:21,755
<i>... the wet hamburger bun contest...</i>

195
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:24,675
<i>... and a man who's brought
a lot of smiles to the world.</i>

196
00:15:24,842 --> 00:15:26,635
<i>See you then.</i>

197
00:15:26,802 --> 00:15:29,847
It was great to hear from you, boss.
Most of the other guys...

198
00:15:30,014 --> 00:15:33,100
... well, they gave up on you.
But I knew you'd come back.

199
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:37,855
Oh, you look great. Anyway,
I whipped up the lipstick you asked for.

200
00:15:38,022 --> 00:15:40,899
And Bobby and Mary,
they can't wait to help.

201
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:44,486
Oh, I also made you these,
special filters.

202
00:15:44,653 --> 00:15:48,032
Wear them tonight
and only breathe through your nose.

203
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:51,160
And all these years I just held my breath.

204
00:15:51,327 --> 00:15:52,494
Really?

205
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:55,831
I could kiss you.

206
00:16:03,047 --> 00:16:07,176
Robin's last class is about to end.
Go pick her up at school.

207
00:16:07,343 --> 00:16:10,846
And if Miss Kelley should have something
better to do with her evening?

208
00:16:11,013 --> 00:16:13,432
There's nothing better.

209
00:16:13,891 --> 00:16:16,226
Where you been all this time?
You're, like, gone.

210
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,603
Been busy.

211
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,897
You gonna make
it to the fairgrounds tomorrow?

212
00:16:20,064 --> 00:16:21,899
Opening day? Our tradition?

213
00:16:22,066 --> 00:16:23,901
Ugh. It's this night job.

214
00:16:24,068 --> 00:16:25,736
Details. As in more.

215
00:16:25,903 --> 00:16:29,365
Just helping some spud. It'd bore you.

216
00:16:31,659 --> 00:16:33,452
Gotta fly.

217
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:37,623
Hey, Alfred.

218
00:17:05,317 --> 00:17:08,946
First two teams are with me
on the roof, the rest of you are down here.

219
00:17:09,113 --> 00:17:11,031
I'm not waiting for the Joker.

220
00:17:11,198 --> 00:17:15,911
And you can bet Batman isn't either.
Neither of them is leaving here a free man.

221
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:17,871
- Is that understood?
- Yes, ma'am.

222
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:28,716
More on the eyes, please.

223
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:30,551
You want lipstick, handsome?

224
00:17:30,718 --> 00:17:34,513
I brought my own, thanks.

225
00:17:35,973 --> 00:17:39,059
Wonderful to see you
showing such interest.

226
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:47,651
Okay, Bobby, Mary,
Uncle Joker's counting on you.

227
00:17:47,818 --> 00:17:49,278
Go make him proud.

228
00:17:54,408 --> 00:17:56,702
This is strictly
an observation mission for you.

229
00:17:56,869 --> 00:18:00,164
Stay in the copter
and do not touch any of the controls.

230
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:02,750
If there's any trouble, just say "boosters."

231
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:06,670
The computer's all voice-controlled.
You don't need to understand a thing.

232
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:09,298
Figure I wouldn't anyway.

233
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,683
Joker's thought this through.
The publicity's brought the cops...

234
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,894
... and they'll keep me from him.

235
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:28,150
That a cloak?

236
00:18:28,984 --> 00:18:30,152
Cool.

237
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:32,613
<i>Commissioner, something's incoming.</i>

238
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:35,491
- <i>We can't get a lock on it.</i>
- I don't see anything.

239
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:40,996
Everything's on auto.
Touch any of it and you're fired.

240
00:18:41,163 --> 00:18:42,498
Cool, boss.

241
00:18:45,209 --> 00:18:47,628
Keep at it! Do a channel sweep.

242
00:18:48,754 --> 00:18:49,838
Holy...

243
00:18:51,715 --> 00:18:54,635
- He can fly.
- Not for long. Hit the flood!

244
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:13,320
Batman, you are under arrest.

245
00:19:34,925 --> 00:19:36,718
Fox, Stokes, rush him!

246
00:19:36,885 --> 00:19:39,137
- Rush him?
- He's twice your age, son.

247
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:40,597
Find the nerve.

248
00:19:51,567 --> 00:19:55,946
What can we say about our next guest
that hasn't been said before? Frank?

249
00:19:56,113 --> 00:20:00,784
He's a kook, Dave. A maniac.
No, I mean it, he's a nut.

250
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:03,287
Nothing like it, eh?

251
00:20:03,453 --> 00:20:06,915
I always take this moment
to say a little affirmation to myself.

252
00:20:07,082 --> 00:20:10,794
So many faces. So few smiles.

253
00:20:10,961 --> 00:20:15,716
Hey, now, no need to be nervous.
Just follow my lead and be yourself.

254
00:20:18,969 --> 00:20:22,723
And our special guest,
the Clown Prince of Crime...

255
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,641
... Joker.

256
00:20:37,946 --> 00:20:40,657
Get a copter in close to blow
this stuff away!

257
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:47,331
Freeze, Batman!

258
00:20:59,676 --> 00:21:01,637
Fire weapons.

259
00:21:04,973 --> 00:21:06,350
Do something!

260
00:21:19,446 --> 00:21:22,699
Joker, you've asked for a chance
to share your side of things.

261
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:25,452
I'm told you've killed
about 600 people.

262
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:28,705
- How exactly does your side of that go?
- Stop right there.

263
00:21:28,872 --> 00:21:32,668
This is a sensitive man,
and I won't have him being harassed.

264
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:35,879
That's all right. I want people to get me.

265
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,547
All right, then.

266
00:21:41,009 --> 00:21:44,888
That's why I'm gonna kill everyone
in this room.

267
00:21:46,223 --> 00:21:47,307
Okay.

268
00:21:47,474 --> 00:21:50,143
I think that's a little more insight
than we had in mind.

269
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:52,562
It's okay, he doesn't really mean that.

270
00:21:52,729 --> 00:21:54,564
He's just trying to ease the tension.

271
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:56,066
Funny way to go about it.

272
00:21:56,233 --> 00:21:59,861
You have to remember,
this man isn't responsible for those killings.

273
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:02,990
He's merely a victim of the Batman's
psychotic obsession.

274
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:05,742
I thought
I was Batman's psychotic obsession.

275
00:22:07,244 --> 00:22:09,663
So you think the Batman's
the real sicko here.

276
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:13,208
Without a doubt. He's an
obsessive-compulsive, narcissistic...

277
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:15,460
... hero-complexed sociopath.

278
00:22:15,627 --> 00:22:19,631
- I would love a shot at him as a patient.
- Do guests get to keep these?

279
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:25,262
Heh. Sure, you do whatever you want with it.
We got a closet full of them.

280
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:33,395
So long as you won't miss it.

281
00:22:45,949 --> 00:22:49,745
Breathe, David. Breathe.

282
00:23:33,205 --> 00:23:34,331
Billy close.

283
00:23:35,957 --> 00:23:38,126
Ace the cloak.

284
00:23:58,855 --> 00:24:01,358
Batman, land your vehicle now!

285
00:24:01,525 --> 00:24:03,568
Been following on the radio.

286
00:24:03,735 --> 00:24:06,613
It's over. Joker's gone.

287
00:24:07,614 --> 00:24:11,201
- How many?
- Don't know. Lots.

288
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:13,995
You have five seconds to comply.

289
00:24:15,831 --> 00:24:17,541
Boosters.

290
00:24:18,917 --> 00:24:21,837
- Boosters!
- Peel.

291
00:24:30,345 --> 00:24:32,347
Head back to the cave.

292
00:24:32,514 --> 00:24:35,559
- I'm not fired?
- You're not fired.

293
00:24:41,731 --> 00:24:44,693
<i>The military has imposed
a communications blackout...</i>

294
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:48,363
<i>... for the 500-mile area
surrounding Corto Maltese...</i>

295
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:52,242
<i>... amid reports of severe weather
affecting the ongoing battle.</i>

296
00:25:54,095 --> 00:25:55,430
<i>While more locally...</i>

297
00:25:55,597 --> 00:25:58,600
<i>... tragedy struck at today's taping
of</i> The Dave Endochrine Show...

298
00:25:58,767 --> 00:26:03,063
<i>... where Joker used his deadly smile gas
to kill the entire audience.</i>

299
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:05,565
<i>Joker is now reported to be on the loose...</i>

300
00:26:05,732 --> 00:26:09,986
<i>... as is the Batman,
who tangled with police at the scene.</i>

301
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:13,990
You never should have come back, Bruce.

302
00:26:14,407 --> 00:26:16,618
You don't know
how much the world has changed.

303
00:26:16,785 --> 00:26:17,953
Selina.

304
00:26:31,174 --> 00:26:34,135
I need your help. It's very important.

305
00:26:44,396 --> 00:26:45,480
My help.

306
00:26:46,648 --> 00:26:50,694
I made myself pretty for you.
You should say thank you.

307
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,153
Thank you.

308
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,531
That's better.

309
00:26:55,198 --> 00:26:58,868
Ee. The years have not been kind,
have they?

310
00:26:59,035 --> 00:27:02,289
Anyhoo,
I have a little errand for one of your girls.

311
00:27:02,455 --> 00:27:03,665
I think her name's Elsie.

312
00:27:03,832 --> 00:27:07,377
She has a date
with a congressman tonight?

313
00:27:07,544 --> 00:27:11,715
<i>The death toll in the wake
of Joker's attack stands at 206...</i>

314
00:27:11,881 --> 00:27:15,385
<i>... including host Dave Endochrine
and Joker's own doctor...</i>

315
00:27:15,552 --> 00:27:17,053
<i>... Bartholomew Wolper.</i>

316
00:27:17,846 --> 00:27:21,057
- How do you fight someone like that?
- Simpler than I've made it.

317
00:27:21,224 --> 00:27:24,227
There's nothing wrong with Joker
that I can't fix.

318
00:27:24,394 --> 00:27:25,729
With my hands.

319
00:27:25,895 --> 00:27:27,856
<i>Both Joker and the Batman...</i>

320
00:27:28,023 --> 00:27:30,984
<i>... who himself left dozens of police
hospitalized...</i>

321
00:27:31,151 --> 00:27:33,069
<i>... are now fugitives from the law.</i>

322
00:27:37,407 --> 00:27:39,409
Oh, Elsie.

323
00:27:43,413 --> 00:27:46,041
There's something I need you to do,
congressman.

324
00:27:46,207 --> 00:27:49,252
- Will you do it?
- Yes, Elsie.

325
00:27:50,462 --> 00:27:53,590
He'll want me to pick up his trail.
This is his game.

326
00:27:54,215 --> 00:27:56,176
- He'll want it to go on.
- <i>I'm sorry.</i>

327
00:27:56,343 --> 00:27:59,012
<i>We're going now
to Ben Derrick, live in Midtown...</i>

328
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:01,014
<i>... where a shocking story is unfolding.</i>

329
00:28:01,181 --> 00:28:04,059
<i>Lola, I'm standing outside
the Gotham Vista Hotel...</i>

330
00:28:04,225 --> 00:28:06,561
<i>... where Congressman
Hector Alejandro Noches...</i>

331
00:28:06,728 --> 00:28:08,938
<i>... has climbed out onto a 40th-story ledge...</i>

332
00:28:09,105 --> 00:28:12,275
<i>... and is demanding a full nuclear
strike against Corto Maltese.</i>

333
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:24,079
You don't think they'll launch
their nukes over this?

334
00:28:24,245 --> 00:28:25,580
We have to strike first!

335
00:28:25,747 --> 00:28:27,957
We're the most powerful country
in the world.

336
00:28:28,124 --> 00:28:29,459
Sir, please.

337
00:28:32,629 --> 00:28:35,715
<i>Lola, it's just confusion
and one messy body down here right now.</i>

338
00:28:35,882 --> 00:28:39,594
<i>Commissioner Yindel has arrived on the scene.
I'll see if I can get a statement.</i>

339
00:28:39,761 --> 00:28:41,763
Commissioner,
any word on why the congressman...?

340
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:43,515
Get those cameras behind the line!

341
00:28:46,017 --> 00:28:48,686
Commissioner. O'Halloran, 6th precinct.

342
00:28:48,853 --> 00:28:51,022
- Lieutenant.
- Any way I can help?

343
00:28:51,189 --> 00:28:53,983
This wasn't a suicide.
The girl upstairs has been drugged.

344
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:57,904
- Says she's from Kyle Escorts.
- That's Selina Kyle. My old beat.

345
00:28:58,071 --> 00:29:01,825
- Shut it down and bring her in.
- Yes, ma'am.

346
00:29:01,991 --> 00:29:03,284
Commissioner.

347
00:29:03,451 --> 00:29:06,371
Lieutenant O'Halloran, ma'am.
Heard there was...

348
00:29:06,538 --> 00:29:08,498
- Is something wrong?
- Stop that man!

349
00:29:21,678 --> 00:29:23,847
All units to Kyle Escorts.

350
00:29:49,372 --> 00:29:51,124
Selina.

351
00:29:55,545 --> 00:29:57,172
Bruce...

352
00:29:58,089 --> 00:30:01,509
... he's worse than ever.
He's using lipstick...

353
00:30:01,676 --> 00:30:02,802
... mind control.

354
00:30:06,473 --> 00:30:08,808
The police are going to be here soon.
Can you walk?

355
00:30:09,809 --> 00:30:11,686
I think so.

356
00:30:13,146 --> 00:30:14,689
Boss, found something.

357
00:30:14,856 --> 00:30:16,232
Cotton candy.

358
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:17,859
The fairgrounds.

359
00:30:18,026 --> 00:30:19,319
Thousands will be there.

360
00:30:19,486 --> 00:30:20,904
Half my friends will be there.

361
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:23,406
- Fan out.
- Bring the Wing in close.

362
00:30:23,573 --> 00:30:24,908
Don't take the girl.

363
00:30:25,074 --> 00:30:27,118
- He'll...
- Don't worry.

364
00:30:28,578 --> 00:30:30,580
On the ground. Now.

365
00:30:56,523 --> 00:30:59,484
Good soldier. Good soldier.

366
00:31:12,914 --> 00:31:14,666
Boss, something's coming.

367
00:31:14,832 --> 00:31:17,627
- It's big. It's...
- Him.

368
00:31:22,924 --> 00:31:24,926
He's there. Hold tight.

369
00:31:32,141 --> 00:31:35,478
Children, do you know
why all these people are so upset?

370
00:31:35,645 --> 00:31:38,106
That bad man up there.

371
00:31:39,941 --> 00:31:41,651
Bobby, you know what to do.

372
00:31:50,493 --> 00:31:53,746
- Incoming.
- Wait, let it get closer.

373
00:32:01,963 --> 00:32:03,715
Don't worry, Mary dear.

374
00:32:03,881 --> 00:32:10,179
You two distract the little one,
and I'll handle the bad man.

375
00:32:45,089 --> 00:32:47,800
Are you out of your mind?

376
00:32:49,719 --> 00:32:52,013
I'm through playing, Joker.

377
00:32:52,722 --> 00:32:55,141
Be still, my heart.

378
00:33:15,161 --> 00:33:16,412
Don't leave in such a rush.

379
00:33:17,246 --> 00:33:19,082
- Unh.
- Aah!

380
00:33:41,062 --> 00:33:43,856
You're the Joker, right?
Batman's gonna kick your ass.

381
00:33:44,023 --> 00:33:47,026
He's gonna have to go through you first.

382
00:33:52,949 --> 00:33:54,784
Let the boy go, Joker.

383
00:34:19,767 --> 00:34:20,935
Oh, that's bad.

384
00:34:21,102 --> 00:34:24,480
You should get that looked at
when you have a chance.

385
00:35:17,158 --> 00:35:18,534
He's got a gun.

386
00:35:18,701 --> 00:35:20,703
Freeze, Joker.

387
00:35:51,943 --> 00:35:53,569
Excuse me, sorry. Beg your pardon.

388
00:35:53,736 --> 00:35:56,364
Coming through. Excuse me.
Sorry about that.

389
00:35:56,531 --> 00:36:00,493
Ooh, my bad. Excuse me.

390
00:36:30,439 --> 00:36:32,400
No more.

391
00:36:36,404 --> 00:36:40,950
All the people I've murdered
by letting you live.

392
00:36:41,784 --> 00:36:44,078
I never kept count.

393
00:36:44,954 --> 00:36:46,789
- I did.
- I know.

394
00:36:49,709 --> 00:36:51,711
And I love you for it.

395
00:37:01,721 --> 00:37:05,308
It's finally here, isn't it?
The moment we've both dreamed about.

396
00:37:10,938 --> 00:37:13,482
Oh, don't tell me you're gonna fall asleep
before we finish.

397
00:37:14,108 --> 00:37:17,486
You have gotten old, haven't you?

398
00:37:21,991 --> 00:37:25,786
Not quite how I imagined it...

399
00:37:26,495 --> 00:37:29,498
... but we can still end on a high note.

400
00:37:46,974 --> 00:37:50,102
You're in trouble now.

401
00:37:53,856 --> 00:37:55,024
Go ahead.

402
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:58,694
Say this has never happened
to you before.

403
00:37:59,403 --> 00:38:00,529
Shut up.

404
00:38:00,696 --> 00:38:02,740
Make me.

405
00:38:02,907 --> 00:38:05,368
Come on, finish me.

406
00:38:10,581 --> 00:38:13,459
Doesn't matter. I win.

407
00:38:13,626 --> 00:38:16,212
I made you lose control.

408
00:38:19,548 --> 00:38:22,718
And they'll kill you for it.

409
00:38:26,222 --> 00:38:29,350
See you in hell.

410
00:38:57,336 --> 00:38:59,088
Keep going, down here.

411
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:02,842
There's another body.

412
00:39:07,596 --> 00:39:10,516
Watch yourselves.
Witnesses saw both of them this way.

413
00:39:15,771 --> 00:39:17,398
Down this way. Go right.

414
00:39:18,482 --> 00:39:21,402
Robin, call the copter.

415
00:39:22,111 --> 00:39:24,488
Locate my signal.

416
00:39:36,959 --> 00:39:38,669
Don't touch him.

417
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:04,904
Freeze, you son of a bitch. Unh.

418
00:40:05,571 --> 00:40:07,656
Cute gun.

419
00:40:07,823 --> 00:40:10,534
- Move forward.
- Keep your heads straight.

420
00:40:12,828 --> 00:40:14,497
How are we supposed to find him?

421
00:40:14,663 --> 00:40:16,415
If it isn't a cop, shoot it.

422
00:40:26,884 --> 00:40:28,844
- Over there.
- Clumsy.

423
00:40:37,561 --> 00:40:39,188
Stop laughing.

424
00:41:21,772 --> 00:41:23,691
Auto-pilot. Property damage.

425
00:43:02,289 --> 00:43:04,833
- He gonna make it?
- Suture.

426
00:43:10,381 --> 00:43:14,093
He'll live. He's far too stubborn to die.

427
00:43:18,138 --> 00:43:21,850
<i>Through this horrific murder
and his attacks on the police...</i>

428
00:43:22,017 --> 00:43:25,479
<i>... the Batman has revealed himself
to be an unqualified menace.</i>

429
00:43:25,646 --> 00:43:29,358
<i>I have asked the governor to place
the state police at Gotham City's disposal...</i>

430
00:43:29,525 --> 00:43:31,819
<i>... to hunt down this dangerous fugitive.</i>

431
00:43:31,986 --> 00:43:34,530
- No comment.
- Jim, you can't protect him anymore.

432
00:43:34,697 --> 00:43:36,198
<i>He's a murderer now.</i>

433
00:43:36,365 --> 00:43:38,701
<i>If you've talked to him,
you have to let me know.</i>

434
00:43:38,867 --> 00:43:40,536
He and I don't talk anymore.

435
00:43:40,703 --> 00:43:42,454
<i>I know everything I need to know.</i>

436
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,334
<i>Joker's death and Batman's fugitive status...</i>

437
00:43:47,501 --> 00:43:51,839
<i>... have become more than local
or statewide issues these days.</i>

438
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:57,886
<i>... and this morning,
White House spokesperson Melanie Endara...</i>

439
00:43:58,053 --> 00:44:01,724
<i>... said the FBI was providing
regular updates to the Oval Office...</i>

440
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:04,643
<i>... on the progress police are making
in the hunt for Batman.</i>

441
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:08,522
- The groceries? Now?
- Wanna eat tonight?

442
00:44:10,107 --> 00:44:12,318
I'm going.

443
00:44:14,862 --> 00:44:17,406
Be careful. And no cigars.

444
00:44:21,827 --> 00:44:25,414
<i>Another splinter group has emerged
from the remains of the Mutant army.</i>

445
00:44:25,581 --> 00:44:27,416
<i>Calling themselves the Nixons...</i>

446
00:44:27,583 --> 00:44:30,252
<i>... the group is committing
a spree of violent armed holdups...</i>

447
00:44:30,419 --> 00:44:33,255
<i>We interrupt this program
to bring you a special report.</i>

448
00:44:33,422 --> 00:44:36,633
<i>We now go live to a statement
from the president of the United States.</i>

449
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:40,554
<i>Well, folks, I've got some good news
and some bad news.</i>

450
00:44:40,721 --> 00:44:43,599
<i>The good news is that
our brave American troops...</i>

451
00:44:43,766 --> 00:44:46,101
<i>... were victorious in Corto Maltese...</i>

452
00:44:46,268 --> 00:44:49,063
<i>... and the Soviets
have completely withdrawn.</i>

453
00:44:49,229 --> 00:44:51,357
<i>Bad news is, well...</i>

454
00:44:51,523 --> 00:44:55,235
<i>... looks like those Russians
are some mighty sore losers.</i>

455
00:45:13,462 --> 00:45:16,465
<i>The warhead appears
to be on a course for Corto Maltese...</i>

456
00:45:16,632 --> 00:45:19,134
<i>... where 50,000 U.S. troops are stationed...</i>

457
00:45:19,301 --> 00:45:22,346
<i>... along with the 2 million citizens
of the small island.</i>

458
00:45:22,513 --> 00:45:25,140
<i>But the larger questions
on everyone's minds...</i>

459
00:45:25,307 --> 00:45:29,269
<i>... are whether this is the first strike
in a full-scale nuclear attack...</i>

460
00:45:29,436 --> 00:45:32,481
<i>... and whether the U.S.
has begun retaliation.</i>

461
00:45:57,339 --> 00:46:00,509
<i>We are getting reports
that the missile has changed course...</i>

462
00:46:00,676 --> 00:46:03,095
<i>... and will now detonate over an...</i>

463
00:46:06,432 --> 00:46:07,850
What happened?

464
00:47:41,068 --> 00:47:45,614
- What happened? Is he dead?
- No, he's quite alive.

465
00:47:45,781 --> 00:47:48,534
Appears the whole city
is having an outage.

466
00:47:50,577 --> 00:47:54,414
Odd that the emergency generator
hasn't kicked in.

467
00:47:57,209 --> 00:48:00,879
Aces. My cheapo watch stopped too.
Figure I didn't just buy it.

468
00:48:04,091 --> 00:48:06,134
- Boss.
- Show me.

469
00:48:10,514 --> 00:48:11,974
Clark...

470
00:48:12,724 --> 00:48:15,060
... you let them do it.

471
00:48:15,727 --> 00:48:17,312
You idiot.

472
00:48:17,479 --> 00:48:21,233
- What? What's happening?
- Sir, you have to rest.

473
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:25,320
A blackout, our generator's dead,
and Robin's watch stopped.

474
00:48:25,487 --> 00:48:27,823
It's an electromagnetic pulse.

475
00:48:27,990 --> 00:48:30,409
In all likelihood, from a nuclear explosion.

476
00:48:30,576 --> 00:48:31,827
You don't know that.

477
00:48:34,121 --> 00:48:35,163
Oh, dear.

478
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:37,666
We're still here.

479
00:48:39,751 --> 00:48:41,003
For the moment.

480
00:48:44,298 --> 00:48:47,467
May mean the Soviets
detonated a cold bringer.

481
00:48:47,634 --> 00:48:49,428
Not meant to kill us, just cripple us.

482
00:48:51,388 --> 00:48:55,100
- Ever ride a horse before?
- Don't think I've ever seen a horse before.

483
00:48:55,267 --> 00:48:58,061
You're about to learn fast.

484
00:49:03,025 --> 00:49:07,487
Not as fun as I thought it would be.

485
00:49:20,834 --> 00:49:22,836
This is our moment.

486
00:49:23,003 --> 00:49:24,880
Gotham is helpless.

487
00:49:25,047 --> 00:49:26,548
We will take charge.

488
00:49:26,715 --> 00:49:29,051
We will kill anyone who stands in our way.

489
00:49:30,552 --> 00:49:32,179
No.

490
00:49:46,485 --> 00:49:50,405
Tonight I am going to maintain order
in Gotham City.

491
00:49:50,572 --> 00:49:52,407
You are going to help me.

492
00:49:54,618 --> 00:49:56,078
But not with these.

493
00:49:56,244 --> 00:49:58,246
These are loud and clumsy.

494
00:49:58,413 --> 00:50:01,416
These are the weapons of cowards.

495
00:50:03,418 --> 00:50:05,587
Our weapons are precise and quiet.

496
00:50:05,754 --> 00:50:07,714
In time I will teach them to you.

497
00:50:07,881 --> 00:50:12,386
But for tonight, you will rely
on your brains and your fists.

498
00:50:12,552 --> 00:50:15,138
Tonight, we are the law.

499
00:50:15,305 --> 00:50:17,349
Tonight, I am the law.

500
00:50:27,275 --> 00:50:29,653
- Looters are gonna strip us dry.
- We need more cops.

501
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:32,114
- We don't even have phone lines.
- One at a time.

502
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:34,616
Commissioner, we got a problem.

503
00:51:21,037 --> 00:51:22,497
Slice and dice.

504
00:52:02,871 --> 00:52:07,626
- Hey, we need to put out the fires.
- Are you crazy? Let go of me.

505
00:52:09,211 --> 00:52:11,254
Get out of my store, huh. Get out of here.

506
00:52:24,851 --> 00:52:26,019
Listen up.

507
00:52:26,186 --> 00:52:28,063
This is our neighborhood.

508
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:29,397
Our homes.

509
00:52:29,564 --> 00:52:31,691
We're better than this.

510
00:52:32,734 --> 00:52:36,571
The fires are spreading,
and the fire department isn't coming.

511
00:52:36,738 --> 00:52:39,407
So if any of you want roofs
over your heads tomorrow...

512
00:52:39,574 --> 00:52:42,702
... and the day after that, start helping.

513
00:52:45,497 --> 00:52:48,583
I have buckets.
Let's get those hydrants open.

514
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:50,168
- All right.
- Yeah, right.

515
00:52:50,335 --> 00:52:51,378
Let's do it.

516
00:52:56,758 --> 00:52:59,928
- Here, let me help you.
- The drugstore has bandages.

517
00:53:17,237 --> 00:53:20,282
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls...

518
00:53:20,448 --> 00:53:23,785
... I'm here to appeal
to your community spirit.

519
00:53:23,952 --> 00:53:26,329
I know you've had your differences
in the past.

520
00:53:26,496 --> 00:53:29,124
Some of you will even argue
that you can't work together.

521
00:53:29,291 --> 00:53:30,458
That's fine.

522
00:53:30,625 --> 00:53:32,627
Those people will stay tied up.

523
00:53:32,794 --> 00:53:35,297
And it will not be a function
of which group you're in.

524
00:53:35,463 --> 00:53:39,134
What is this, the gestapo?
He lumps us together with criminals. Unh.

525
00:53:39,301 --> 00:53:40,385
Shut up, man.

526
00:53:40,552 --> 00:53:44,097
The rest of you can lend a hand
to keep our city from falling apart.

527
00:53:44,264 --> 00:53:46,182
You can lead by example.

528
00:53:46,349 --> 00:53:47,559
Your choice.

529
00:53:47,726 --> 00:53:49,644
I'm sure you're all eager to help.

530
00:54:08,330 --> 00:54:11,082
- I'm suing.
- Good luck with that.

531
00:54:15,962 --> 00:54:18,590
- What are we gonna do?
- Nothing.

532
00:54:18,757 --> 00:54:20,675
He's too big.

533
00:54:20,842 --> 00:54:23,178
- All right.
- All right, keep it going, guys.

534
00:54:26,181 --> 00:54:28,642
- Come on.
- Keep working.

535
00:54:30,518 --> 00:54:33,146
- Come on, guys. Have that.
- More water.

536
00:54:48,203 --> 00:54:50,747
The fire is spreading to the East Side!

537
00:55:16,898 --> 00:55:17,899
Jim!

538
00:55:21,236 --> 00:55:22,737
Oh.

539
00:55:26,157 --> 00:55:29,661
<i>One week now that the U.S.
has been blanketed in a cloud of ash.</i>

540
00:55:29,828 --> 00:55:33,665
<i>Electricity is finally coming back online
in parts of the country...</i>

541
00:55:33,832 --> 00:55:37,711
<i>... but the impact on weather patterns
is expected to last much longer.</i>

542
00:55:37,877 --> 00:55:41,423
<i>It's high noon in Gotham City,
and yet there's no sun...</i>

543
00:55:41,589 --> 00:55:43,633
<i>... and it's the coldest day of the year.</i>

544
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,260
<i>I don't know what to wear.</i>

545
00:55:45,427 --> 00:55:47,387
<i>Every major city in the country but one...</i>

546
00:55:47,554 --> 00:55:50,765
<i>... has descended into riots,
looting and other crimes.</i>

547
00:55:50,932 --> 00:55:53,351
<i>The president has imposed
limited martial law...</i>

548
00:55:53,518 --> 00:55:55,729
<i>... but this has been seen to have little effect.</i>

549
00:55:56,104 --> 00:55:58,064
<i>Only Gotham has maintained order...</i>

550
00:55:58,231 --> 00:56:00,942
<i>... thanks to the vigilante gang
being led by the Batman...</i>

551
00:56:01,109 --> 00:56:03,236
<i>... adding to the massive
credibility nightmare...</i>

552
00:56:03,403 --> 00:56:06,072
<i>... being experienced
by the president's administration.</i>

553
00:56:08,116 --> 00:56:11,911
- How are you feeling, son?
- Better, Mr. President. Thank you.

554
00:56:12,078 --> 00:56:14,039
Sorry I haven't been able to help more.

555
00:56:14,205 --> 00:56:18,126
Oh. This'll all blow over.
Don't you give it another thought.

556
00:56:18,585 --> 00:56:22,130
So long as you're up to handling
our other little problem now?

557
00:56:22,630 --> 00:56:23,631
Of course, sir.

558
00:56:23,798 --> 00:56:26,634
Though he'll never let me
bring him in alive.

559
00:56:26,801 --> 00:56:30,472
Well, you do what you need to do.

560
00:56:35,101 --> 00:56:37,228
You always did do it wrong, Bruce.

561
00:56:37,395 --> 00:56:40,148
Been five years since I busted out of jail...

562
00:56:40,315 --> 00:56:42,025
... and you know I've been busy.

563
00:56:42,192 --> 00:56:43,818
But I made it hard on them.

564
00:56:43,985 --> 00:56:45,945
They had to cover up my escape...

565
00:56:46,112 --> 00:56:48,281
... and now they have to cover up my work.

566
00:56:48,448 --> 00:56:51,951
And it's a lot harder to frost me
if they can't admit I exist.

567
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:57,665
You draw too much attention to yourself.
Always have.

568
00:56:57,832 --> 00:57:00,794
I mean, sure, you play it mysterious...

569
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:03,338
... but it's a noisy kind of mysterious.

570
00:57:03,505 --> 00:57:06,132
You, they have to kill.

571
00:57:06,299 --> 00:57:08,134
What is it you want, Oliver?

572
00:57:08,301 --> 00:57:10,345
A piece of him. The schoolboy.

573
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:14,557
I always knew it would come down
to the two of you someday.

574
00:57:14,724 --> 00:57:16,851
The world's not big enough
for the both of you.

575
00:57:18,686 --> 00:57:20,772
Doesn't have to be a big piece.

576
00:57:20,939 --> 00:57:24,359
Just count me in, for old times' sake.

577
00:57:26,194 --> 00:57:28,363
Still hurts when it's cold.

578
00:57:28,530 --> 00:57:31,908
Lately, it's been cold a lot.

579
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:41,543
Good. Now take him into a canter.

580
00:57:42,544 --> 00:57:43,545
No!

581
00:57:49,175 --> 00:57:51,553
Crime Alley.

582
00:58:00,478 --> 00:58:05,275
- You're not even close to fully recovered.
- Neither is he.

583
00:58:12,323 --> 00:58:16,911
He doesn't need a walking hospital bed
to keep his insides together.

584
00:58:19,998 --> 00:58:22,584
I know you're not looking forward
to your part in this.

585
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:24,919
I can't say it will be pleasant.

586
00:58:25,086 --> 00:58:28,256
But it does fall within my duties.

587
00:58:35,346 --> 00:58:37,432
One hour.

588
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:41,769
<i>Army troops have evacuated
the downtown slum known as Crime Alley.</i>

589
00:58:41,936 --> 00:58:45,356
<i>No explanation has been given,
and news coverage has been flatly...</i>

590
00:58:59,370 --> 00:59:01,956
Vehicle approaching from the west.
Something huge.

591
00:59:04,083 --> 00:59:06,211
Let it through. Then close the hole.

592
00:59:12,967 --> 00:59:16,137
He'll still be weak,
between the nuke and so little sunlight.

593
00:59:17,096 --> 00:59:20,642
Just how weak we'll see
when he finds my first surprise.

594
00:59:20,808 --> 00:59:25,063
Yeah, but how long you expect
to last against him?

595
00:59:25,230 --> 00:59:27,565
- Long enough.
- Boss.

596
00:59:27,732 --> 00:59:29,734
I'm trying to get the plan here.

597
00:59:30,401 --> 00:59:33,655
I mean, you gonna die tonight or what?

598
00:59:34,447 --> 00:59:36,449
Figure I will.

599
00:59:40,495 --> 00:59:42,288
I've got a visual. It's him.

600
00:59:42,455 --> 00:59:45,458
Do not engage. Just monitor his position.

601
00:59:45,625 --> 00:59:47,418
Wait, I lost him.

602
00:59:47,585 --> 00:59:50,838
Don't worry. He can't hide from what's coming.

603
01:00:52,567 --> 01:00:55,320
Isn't this a school night, young lady?

604
01:00:55,486 --> 01:00:56,988
Clark.

605
01:01:00,199 --> 01:01:01,993
This is between you and me.

606
01:01:06,414 --> 01:01:10,084
- We don't have to do this.
- Sure we do.

607
01:01:16,466 --> 01:01:18,593
Bruce, be reasonable.

608
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:20,178
You know what my orders are.

609
01:01:20,678 --> 01:01:21,929
Your orders?

610
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:26,494
You say you answer
to some sort of authority.

611
01:02:26,661 --> 01:02:29,122
They only want me dead
because I'm an embarrassment.

612
01:02:30,289 --> 01:02:32,291
Because I do what they can't.

613
01:02:32,458 --> 01:02:34,001
What kind of authority is that?

614
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:44,303
It doesn't matter. It's their world,
and they won't stand for you anymore.

615
01:02:44,470 --> 01:02:47,014
If it isn't me, it'll just be someone else.

616
01:02:47,932 --> 01:02:50,768
Really? Who do they send after you?

617
01:02:58,192 --> 01:03:00,862
We got the vehicle. Appears disabled.

618
01:03:01,028 --> 01:03:03,531
- Unknown if anyone's inside.
- <i>Roger that.</i>

619
01:03:03,698 --> 01:03:05,867
<i>Approach with caution.</i>

620
01:04:55,309 --> 01:04:56,978
Bruce, this is idiotic.

621
01:05:10,825 --> 01:05:12,577
That was three ribs, Bruce.

622
01:05:14,245 --> 01:05:15,580
Don't make me do this.

623
01:05:21,752 --> 01:05:24,130
<i>Robin. This is a recording.</i>

624
01:05:24,297 --> 01:05:26,966
<i>Clark should be too busy to listen now.
Here's the plan.</i>

625
01:05:34,098 --> 01:05:35,308
Anything good on?

626
01:05:38,352 --> 01:05:42,273
<i>What was that?
Who's up there? I want people on that roof.</i>

627
01:06:36,911 --> 01:06:38,371
Get ready.

628
01:06:46,337 --> 01:06:48,839
What are you doing?
Do you want me to kill you?

629
01:06:49,006 --> 01:06:51,092
Oh, you're not going to kill me.

630
01:06:51,258 --> 01:06:52,259
Now.

631
01:06:58,766 --> 01:07:00,393
It wasn't easy to make, Clark.

632
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:03,062
It took years and cost a fortune.

633
01:07:03,229 --> 01:07:05,564
Luckily, I had both.

634
01:07:06,107 --> 01:07:07,733
He's down here!

635
01:07:09,026 --> 01:07:10,695
Eyes downside, spud.

636
01:07:10,861 --> 01:07:12,530
Hi-ho freaking silver.

637
01:07:15,783 --> 01:07:17,952
You're feeling it now, aren't you?

638
01:07:18,119 --> 01:07:21,080
What the rest of us live with every day.

639
01:07:21,247 --> 01:07:22,790
Your own mortality.

640
01:07:24,125 --> 01:07:25,376
Don't worry, you'll survive.

641
01:07:25,793 --> 01:07:28,629
The kryptonite will work its way
out of your lungs soon enough.

642
01:07:32,466 --> 01:07:34,635
Bruce. Your heart.

643
01:07:45,896 --> 01:07:47,815
We got them. They got nowhere to go.

644
01:07:57,908 --> 01:08:00,494
But I didn't have to go easy on you.

645
01:08:00,661 --> 01:08:03,330
A different binding agent, a stronger mix.

646
01:08:03,497 --> 01:08:05,499
I want you to remember that.

647
01:08:05,666 --> 01:08:08,002
I wanted to remind you
to stay out of my way.

648
01:08:08,169 --> 01:08:11,172
In all the years to come,
in your most private moments...

649
01:08:11,338 --> 01:08:15,509
... I want you to remember
the one man who beat you.

650
01:08:20,306 --> 01:08:22,183
Bruce.

651
01:08:49,752 --> 01:08:50,753
Don't touch him.

652
01:08:52,129 --> 01:08:55,633
<i>Funeral proceedings are underway today
for Bruce Wayne...</i>

653
01:08:55,800 --> 01:09:00,054
<i>... as Gotham City still reels
from last week's spectacular revelation...</i>

654
01:09:00,221 --> 01:09:03,641
<i>... that the world famous billionaire
was the Batman.</i>

655
01:09:03,808 --> 01:09:08,395
<i>All of Wayne's secrets, his methods
and tools in his decades as the Batman...</i>

656
01:09:08,562 --> 01:09:11,982
<i>... died with him
as Wayne Manor burned to the ground.</i>

657
01:09:12,149 --> 01:09:14,735
<i>The fire was apparently set by his butler...</i>

658
01:09:14,902 --> 01:09:17,196
<i>... who himself died of a stroke at the scene.</i>

659
01:09:17,363 --> 01:09:19,073
<i>Every penny of Wayne's wealth...</i>

660
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:23,410
<i>... all of his accounts and financial holdings,
have also disappeared.</i>

661
01:09:23,577 --> 01:09:24,745
Amen.

662
01:09:35,089 --> 01:09:37,341
You've got some nerve showing up here.

663
01:09:37,508 --> 01:09:40,761
- I know who killed him, damn you...
- Selina.

664
01:09:40,928 --> 01:09:44,682
Don't. It's no use. Let's go.

665
01:09:46,934 --> 01:09:48,269
Were you a friend?

666
01:09:48,936 --> 01:09:52,106
I think so. I honestly couldn't say.

667
01:09:52,606 --> 01:09:54,775
Sounds about right.

668
01:10:37,234 --> 01:10:40,321
- See that ledge? Get another lamp up there.
- Right, boss.

669
01:10:40,487 --> 01:10:43,782
- And, you, one there too.
- Cool, boss.

670
01:10:44,366 --> 01:10:46,160
There's a fresh spring under here.

671
01:10:46,327 --> 01:10:48,495
I want our water supply set up in one hour.

672
01:10:48,662 --> 01:10:52,333
- We ain't got forever, people.
- Sure we do.

673
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:16,357
Starting now,
I'm going to teach you everything.

674
01:11:16,523 --> 01:11:19,693
All of my ways. All of my secrets.

675
01:11:19,860 --> 01:11:22,780
You're going to be my army,
operating in the shadows...

676
01:11:22,947 --> 01:11:24,865
... keeping Gotham safe.

677
01:11:25,032 --> 01:11:28,494
And we're going to take
as long as we need.

678
01:11:28,661 --> 01:11:31,664
Now, do what Oliver says
and get to work.

679
01:11:31,830 --> 01:11:33,540
- Right, boss.
- You got it, boss.

680
01:11:33,707 --> 01:11:37,044
- Give me a hand here.
- Go. Come on, come on, come on.

681
01:11:38,671 --> 01:11:40,673
Heard the schoolboy found you out.

682
01:11:40,839 --> 01:11:43,384
It's all right.
I think the message got through.

683
01:11:43,550 --> 01:11:46,887
As long as we stay quiet,
he'll leave us alone.

684
01:11:47,054 --> 01:11:51,558
- You gonna be all right with this?
- This quieter mysterious?

685
01:11:51,725 --> 01:11:55,104
I spent 10 years looking for a good death.

686
01:11:55,270 --> 01:11:56,730
This...

687
01:11:58,524 --> 01:12:00,734
This'll be a good life.

688
01:12:26,468 --> 01:12:28,262
Good enough.
