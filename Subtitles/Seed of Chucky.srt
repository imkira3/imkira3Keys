2
00:02:41,778 --> 00:02:46,240
That is the ugliest thing I've
ever seen in my whole life!

3
00:02:48,618 --> 00:02:51,161
It certainly is.
Who sent it?

4
00:02:52,289 --> 00:02:54,540
Oh! That's strange.
It doesn't say.

5
00:02:54,624 --> 00:02:56,292
Where could it
have come from?

6
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:59,795
I don't like it.
It's staring at me.

7
00:03:00,171 --> 00:03:02,590
Oh, it's probably one of
Uncle Arthur's little jokes.

8
00:03:02,674 --> 00:03:04,383
Well, I don't think
it's funny at all.

9
00:03:52,682 --> 00:03:55,267
Darling, I'm
just going to have a shower.

10
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:58,437
Be there in a minute.

11
00:04:31,888 --> 00:04:35,891
Claudia, I told you not to
leave your toys lying about.

12
00:04:39,562 --> 00:04:42,356
Good God! You are hideous.

13
00:04:43,108 --> 00:04:44,149
Claudia.

14
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:45,693
What?

15
00:04:45,777 --> 00:04:47,987
I have a bone to pick
you with you, young lady.

16
00:04:48,071 --> 00:04:50,239
We had an agreement,
didn't we?

17
00:04:50,532 --> 00:04:51,532
Didn't we?

18
00:04:51,616 --> 00:04:53,534
But, Daddy, I
didn't leave it there.

19
00:04:53,618 --> 00:04:56,870
In a civilized society,
our word is our bond.

20
00:04:56,955 --> 00:04:59,039
I don't know what
you're talking about.

21
00:04:59,124 --> 00:05:00,624
Just because
it's your birthday,

22
00:05:00,709 --> 00:05:02,668
that doesn't mean
that you can relinquish all...

23
00:05:33,783 --> 00:05:35,451
Richard?

24
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:37,953
Richard, what was that?

25
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,881
You killed
my mommy and daddy.

26
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:18,804
And now
you're pissing your pants!

27
00:07:18,888 --> 00:07:21,974
You're pissing your pants!
You're pissing your pants!

28
00:07:24,727 --> 00:07:27,271
Wake up!
You're pissing your pants!

29
00:07:28,898 --> 00:07:32,734
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

30
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:35,904
what you've all
been waiting for

31
00:07:36,573 --> 00:07:38,323
Shitface!

32
00:07:38,408 --> 00:07:42,536
And the greatest ventriloquist
in all of England:

33
00:07:42,745 --> 00:07:46,039
the psychotic Psychs!

34
00:08:00,597 --> 00:08:03,223
This grotesque abomination...

35
00:08:03,725 --> 00:08:06,935
He ain't even
anatomically correct.

36
00:08:08,938 --> 00:08:10,355
Don't laugh.

37
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,316
It's a serious condition.

38
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:16,987
Six years ago, I found it in
a cemetery back in the States.

39
00:08:17,071 --> 00:08:20,908
Little fucker
tried to rip me throat out.

40
00:08:21,284 --> 00:08:23,785
I was trying
to give you a hug.

41
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:32,044
I don't know much about myself.

42
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:34,546
I know I'm an orphan.

43
00:08:34,797 --> 00:08:36,381
I know I'm a freak.

44
00:08:36,466 --> 00:08:39,426
And, of course,
I know that I'm Japanese.

45
00:08:40,011 --> 00:08:43,639
But why do I have
such terrible nightmares?

46
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:47,392
Filled with hate
and blood and guts.

47
00:08:48,478 --> 00:08:50,520
I'm not like that at all.

48
00:08:51,356 --> 00:08:53,482
I wouldn't even hurt a fly.

49
00:08:53,816 --> 00:08:56,818
Oh, there he goes,
back to his family.

50
00:08:57,654 --> 00:08:59,071
Oh, I envy him.

51
00:09:00,114 --> 00:09:02,991
Sometimes I wonder
about my own parents.

52
00:09:03,701 --> 00:09:05,619
Were they Zen masters?

53
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,746
Did they serve the emperor?

54
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:11,667
Oh, sometimes I wonder what my
mom and dad were really like.

55
00:09:18,675 --> 00:09:21,677
So, you don't
believe in Santa Claus?

56
00:09:22,178 --> 00:09:25,973
Well, trust me, honey, tonight
I'm going to make you believe.

57
00:09:26,516 --> 00:09:29,893
You wait and see what Santa is
bringing you, you naughty girl.

58
00:09:29,978 --> 00:09:32,354
No, I can hear you fine.
You're not breakin' up.

59
00:09:33,398 --> 00:09:36,233
Sheila, I just said
you're not breakin' up.

60
00:09:37,902 --> 00:09:38,902
Oh.

61
00:09:39,821 --> 00:09:41,947
You're breaking up with me?

62
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:46,285
Wait, you're breakin' up
with me on Christmas Eve?

63
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:49,496
Sheila, you have got to be
fuckin' kidding me!

64
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,580
Sheila!

65
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,584
Well, that's just great.

66
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:09,558
God!

67
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:02,486
I knew it!

68
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,781
You're not real.

69
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,872
You were never real.

70
00:11:14,082 --> 00:11:16,208
You know what
that kind of disappointment

71
00:11:16,292 --> 00:11:18,043
can do to somebody?

72
00:11:18,127 --> 00:11:20,796
Do you have any idea

73
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,007
how that can
fuck with your mind?

74
00:11:24,092 --> 00:11:27,386
Fuck with your mind!
Fuck with your mind!

75
00:11:28,763 --> 00:11:31,890
Fuck with your
mind! Fuck with your mind!

76
00:11:31,974 --> 00:11:33,308
Fuck with your mind!

77
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:35,143
Chucky is broke again.

78
00:11:35,311 --> 00:11:37,062
This is bloody ridiculous.

79
00:11:37,438 --> 00:11:38,980
Cut! Cut! Cut!

80
00:11:40,942 --> 00:11:42,484
Kill the snow.

81
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:44,277
Get off me.

82
00:11:44,362 --> 00:11:45,737
Tony, what was that?

83
00:11:45,822 --> 00:11:47,155
I'm sorry,
it's... it's...

84
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,741
This is unprofessional,
and I can't work like this!

85
00:11:49,826 --> 00:11:51,743
No, Jason, I'm sorry.
No, Jason. Please wait.

86
00:11:51,828 --> 00:11:54,496
We're here in Hollywood,
where production is underway

87
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,582
on the new horror flick,
Chucky Goes Psycho.

88
00:11:57,667 --> 00:12:00,710
The film tells the urban
legend of Chucky and Tiffany,

89
00:12:00,795 --> 00:12:03,672
two dolls supposedly possessed
by serial killers.

90
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:05,382
The dolls were
found at the scene

91
00:12:05,466 --> 00:12:07,008
of a string
of real-life murders

92
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:08,844
which remain unsolved
to this day.

93
00:12:12,348 --> 00:12:15,267
Hey, you guys, I think, uh,
Tiffany's left arm is loose again.

94
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:20,772
Yeah, uh,
I'm looking for Jennifer.

95
00:12:20,857 --> 00:12:23,150
Does anyone have
a 20 on Jennifer?

96
00:12:23,234 --> 00:12:25,277
Check the catering truck.

97
00:12:30,408 --> 00:12:31,533
Mmm.

98
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:34,077
Jennifer.
I got you a Skinny Quick.

99
00:12:34,162 --> 00:12:35,245
Oh, uh...

100
00:12:35,329 --> 00:12:37,456
Miss Tilly,
we're ready for you on set.

101
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:41,168
Jennifer, I am so proud of you.

102
00:12:41,252 --> 00:12:42,586
For what?

103
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,713
For sticking to your diet.

104
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:46,965
Oh, thank you.

105
00:12:52,722 --> 00:12:55,223
What's going on
in the world today?

106
00:12:56,058 --> 00:12:58,977
Julia Roberts is getting $25
million for her next film.

107
00:12:59,061 --> 00:13:00,145
Julia Roberts.

108
00:13:00,229 --> 00:13:02,314
I'm so tired of hearing
about Julia Roberts.

109
00:13:02,398 --> 00:13:04,774
You know, I should have
played Erin Brockovich.

110
00:13:04,859 --> 00:13:06,610
I could have done it
without a Wonderbra.

111
00:13:06,694 --> 00:13:08,945
Julia stole that part
right out from under me.

112
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,280
And you know
how she did it?

113
00:13:10,364 --> 00:13:11,490
She slept
with the director.

114
00:13:11,574 --> 00:13:12,824
That's what I think.

115
00:13:12,909 --> 00:13:14,784
Jennifer,
you know that's not true.

116
00:13:14,869 --> 00:13:17,913
How come I don't ever get
any of the good roles anymore?

117
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:20,749
How come nobody
takes me seriously?

118
00:13:20,917 --> 00:13:22,042
Nice tits.

119
00:13:22,126 --> 00:13:23,168
Thank you.

120
00:13:24,795 --> 00:13:27,547
Look at me. I'm an Oscar
nominee, for Christ's sake.

121
00:13:27,632 --> 00:13:29,174
Now I'm fucking
a puppet.

122
00:13:29,258 --> 00:13:33,011
I've got no fan mail,
no paparazzi, no stalkers.

123
00:13:33,346 --> 00:13:35,847
Well, there must be something
I'm right for?

124
00:13:35,932 --> 00:13:37,057
Let's see.

125
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:39,226
Uh... Oh.

126
00:13:39,936 --> 00:13:43,021
Hip-hop superstar
turned director, Redman,

127
00:13:43,147 --> 00:13:45,106
is still looking
for the right actress

128
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:48,151
to take the female lead
in his upcoming Bible epic.

129
00:13:48,319 --> 00:13:50,946
Well, that sounds good.
What's the role?

130
00:13:53,282 --> 00:13:54,866
The Virgin Mary.

131
00:13:54,951 --> 00:13:56,326
What's so funny?

132
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:57,452
Nothing.

133
00:13:57,537 --> 00:13:58,870
It's perfect.

134
00:13:58,955 --> 00:14:01,498
It's just what I need
to reinvent myself.

135
00:14:01,582 --> 00:14:02,916
The Virgin Mary.

136
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:05,544
I always loved
the way she wore robes

137
00:14:05,628 --> 00:14:08,713
and her hair off her face,
kind of like this.

138
00:14:08,798 --> 00:14:11,132
Joan, Joan,
get Morty on the phone

139
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:14,135
and tell him I need to take
a meeting with this Redman.

140
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,262
Right away.

141
00:14:15,346 --> 00:14:16,346
Okay.

142
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:18,223
That's a wrap for
Access Hollywood.

143
00:14:18,307 --> 00:14:20,559
Reporting from Hollywood,
where, as you can see,

144
00:14:20,643 --> 00:14:23,520
Chucky and Tiffany
are alive and well.

145
00:14:23,604 --> 00:14:26,648
You can catch their movie
in theaters next Halloween.

146
00:14:26,816 --> 00:14:28,483
Thank you, Chucky.

147
00:14:29,151 --> 00:14:30,860
Fuck you very much.

148
00:14:38,119 --> 00:14:40,120
I'm no orphan after all!

149
00:14:43,332 --> 00:14:44,457
Well,

150
00:14:45,334 --> 00:14:47,669
you were shit last night.

151
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:51,339
You are going to have
to be more scary.

152
00:14:51,716 --> 00:14:52,924
Scary?

153
00:14:53,342 --> 00:14:54,676
Uh-huh.

154
00:14:56,012 --> 00:14:58,722
Let's rehearse,
shall we, all right?

155
00:15:12,903 --> 00:15:13,987
Oh.

156
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:16,323
Hello.

157
00:15:20,202 --> 00:15:22,621
Look, you got to learn

158
00:15:22,705 --> 00:15:24,789
to tap into
your killer instincts, mate,

159
00:15:24,874 --> 00:15:27,500
give in to
your natural impulses.

160
00:15:27,585 --> 00:15:29,711
Or else I'm going to
have to, uh,

161
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,173
fire you.

162
00:15:39,722 --> 00:15:40,722
Hey!

163
00:15:42,058 --> 00:15:43,058
Hey!

164
00:15:43,893 --> 00:15:45,268
Hey!

165
00:15:46,771 --> 00:15:48,146
Come here!

166
00:15:48,856 --> 00:15:50,231
Come here!

167
00:16:01,619 --> 00:16:02,994
Come here!

168
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:56,965
"Mary, you are truly a
vision of unsullied innocence,

169
00:16:57,258 --> 00:16:59,092
"unique among all women,

170
00:16:59,176 --> 00:17:01,094
"as pure as the virgin snow.

171
00:17:01,178 --> 00:17:03,513
"But I ask,
what is troubling you?"

172
00:17:03,597 --> 00:17:07,475
"Joseph, husband,
there has been a miracle.

173
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:11,229
"As I stand before you,
I must tell you

174
00:17:11,647 --> 00:17:13,273
"I am with child. "

175
00:17:13,649 --> 00:17:15,984
"But, Mary,
how could this be?

176
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:18,528
"In accordance
with God's wishes,

177
00:17:18,821 --> 00:17:21,406
"we have never lain together
as man and wife. "

178
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:23,158
"Yes, it is true.

179
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:26,536
"And I beg you that you
believe me when I tell you

180
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:29,247
"I have never lain
with any man at all.

181
00:17:29,707 --> 00:17:32,625
"Do you believe me, Joseph?
Do you?"

182
00:17:34,336 --> 00:17:35,378
Do you?

183
00:17:35,463 --> 00:17:36,921
Yes. Yes, I do.

184
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,467
Uh, you were great.
You were super.

185
00:17:40,551 --> 00:17:42,260
Thank you,
thank you, Mr. Man.

186
00:17:42,344 --> 00:17:43,887
Oh, can I call you Red?

187
00:17:43,971 --> 00:17:46,765
Listen, there's a whole lot of
different ways I could do it.

188
00:17:46,849 --> 00:17:48,099
Not just the way you saw.

189
00:17:48,184 --> 00:17:51,060
I could do it faster,
I could do it slower.

190
00:17:51,145 --> 00:17:52,812
I could...
I could do it as a rap.

191
00:17:52,897 --> 00:17:55,148
Uh, no, no,
no, no.

192
00:17:55,232 --> 00:17:57,484
You already showed me
a side of the character

193
00:17:57,568 --> 00:17:58,943
that, uh,
I've never seen before.

194
00:17:59,028 --> 00:18:00,361
Oh, thank you.

195
00:18:00,821 --> 00:18:03,907
But I think I'm going to have
to go with my first choice.

196
00:18:03,991 --> 00:18:05,325
Thanks for
comin' by anyway.

197
00:18:05,409 --> 00:18:08,411
I mean, really,
I'm a huge, huge fan.

198
00:18:08,496 --> 00:18:11,039
I really want to work with
you one day. We should call...

199
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:14,042
Um, excuse me, I hope
you don't mind my asking,

200
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:16,085
but who is your first choice?

201
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,629
Julia Roberts.

202
00:18:17,713 --> 00:18:19,672
But thanks for
comin' by, anyway.

203
00:18:19,757 --> 00:18:21,299
Um, listen, listen, Red.

204
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:25,512
Um, I've been giving a lot
of thought to this project,

205
00:18:25,596 --> 00:18:27,972
and I have a lot
of interesting ideas

206
00:18:28,057 --> 00:18:29,641
about the character.

207
00:18:29,725 --> 00:18:31,351
And I was thinkin' maybe

208
00:18:31,435 --> 00:18:35,021
you would like to discuss it
in a more intimate setting.

209
00:18:35,898 --> 00:18:37,649
Just the two of us.

210
00:18:38,108 --> 00:18:39,818
Oh. Oh, well,

211
00:18:40,277 --> 00:18:43,696
I didn't know you were that
passionate about the role.

212
00:18:43,781 --> 00:18:46,991
Oh, yes,
I'm very passionate.

213
00:18:47,076 --> 00:18:48,076
Mmm.

214
00:18:48,744 --> 00:18:52,622
So, shall we say my place?

215
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:56,251
8:00?

216
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:29,576
Pardon me, sir.

217
00:19:32,246 --> 00:19:33,663
Oh. Oh.

218
00:19:33,873 --> 00:19:35,290
Uh, sorry.

219
00:19:36,792 --> 00:19:38,126
Sorry, sir.

220
00:19:39,753 --> 00:19:41,296
Don't mind me.

221
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:43,590
Excuse me.

222
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:46,509
Oh, dear.

223
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:48,261
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

224
00:20:07,781 --> 00:20:08,865
Mom?

225
00:20:10,534 --> 00:20:11,659
Dad?

226
00:20:11,994 --> 00:20:14,704
I've dreamed of this moment
all my life.

227
00:20:15,164 --> 00:20:17,832
I know this must come
as quite a shock.

228
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:21,502
It's going to be
an adjustment for all of us.

229
00:20:24,506 --> 00:20:27,508
Look, I still have the
necklace you left me.

230
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:31,346
I've always wanted to know,
what do these words mean?

231
00:20:31,555 --> 00:20:33,514
Is it our family motto?

232
00:20:34,516 --> 00:20:36,351
Please say something.

233
00:20:38,228 --> 00:20:41,022
It's because of
the way I look, isn't it?

234
00:20:42,983 --> 00:20:46,402
For pity's sake,
please wake up.

235
00:20:49,156 --> 00:20:50,406
"Wake up"?

236
00:20:56,705 --> 00:20:57,914
"Awake. "

237
00:21:32,574 --> 00:21:33,783
Tiff?

238
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:35,410
Chucky?

239
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:40,873
Who the hell are you?

240
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,834
Shitface.

241
00:21:45,129 --> 00:21:47,505
Now, what kind
of a name is that?

242
00:21:47,589 --> 00:21:50,008
Where are your
mother and father?

243
00:21:50,092 --> 00:21:52,844
Judging from that face,
my guess is they're hidin'.

244
00:21:52,928 --> 00:21:54,804
Shut up,
you asshole.

245
00:21:54,888 --> 00:21:58,224
Well, come on. It looks like
the kid fell off the ugly tree

246
00:21:58,308 --> 00:22:00,518
and hit every branch
on the way down.

247
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:05,523
I mean, you got to feel bad
for the parents.

248
00:22:05,607 --> 00:22:07,525
I wonder what
they must look like.

249
00:22:11,238 --> 00:22:12,321
Whoa.

250
00:22:16,243 --> 00:22:18,036
Oh, my God.

251
00:22:30,174 --> 00:22:31,966
What? No.

252
00:22:32,134 --> 00:22:34,385
We, uh...
You didn't... We didn't...

253
00:22:36,472 --> 00:22:39,515
Sweetface, come to Mommy.

254
00:22:50,486 --> 00:22:52,487
What's... What's going on?

255
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,072
Where are we?

256
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:55,948
In Hollywood.

257
00:22:56,116 --> 00:22:57,825
I saw you on the telly.

258
00:22:57,951 --> 00:22:59,911
Chucky, Chucky, wake up.

259
00:23:00,287 --> 00:23:03,372
Look at us.
We've had makeovers.

260
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:05,708
We're movie stars.

261
00:23:08,504 --> 00:23:10,630
Shit. Barbie mode.

262
00:23:10,714 --> 00:23:12,256
No, they're puppets.

263
00:23:12,341 --> 00:23:15,009
They don't walk and talk
by themselves.

264
00:23:15,135 --> 00:23:17,011
Listen,
if you want them to work,

265
00:23:17,096 --> 00:23:19,680
I'm going to have to
take them apart.

266
00:23:39,576 --> 00:23:41,035
Is Mommy ill?

267
00:23:41,703 --> 00:23:43,579
The courts thought so.

268
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:15,653
Heads up!

269
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:36,924
They're stark raving mad!

270
00:24:56,278 --> 00:24:59,030
Hey, you're pissin'
your pants.

271
00:24:59,281 --> 00:25:02,200
Chucky,
she just had an accident.

272
00:25:03,368 --> 00:25:06,704
You mean,
"he" had an accident.

273
00:25:10,626 --> 00:25:12,293
Don't look at me.

274
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:24,388
See, what did I tell you?

275
00:25:24,806 --> 00:25:27,808
A beautiful little girl.

276
00:25:27,935 --> 00:25:31,229
What? Are you blind?
That's my boy.

277
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:32,897
Yeah.

278
00:25:32,981 --> 00:25:36,025
He just hasn't had
his growth spurt, yet.

279
00:25:36,443 --> 00:25:38,486
Don't worry
about it, Son.

280
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:40,905
You're a late bloomer,
that's all.

281
00:25:40,989 --> 00:25:43,866
And it's high time
that you had a real name.

282
00:25:43,951 --> 00:25:45,326
Let's see.

283
00:25:45,953 --> 00:25:48,329
I think
I'm going to call you

284
00:25:49,373 --> 00:25:50,498
Glen.

285
00:25:51,667 --> 00:25:52,667
Glen?

286
00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:55,461
What kind of a name is that
for a girl?

287
00:25:55,545 --> 00:25:59,632
Don't listen to him, honey.
From now on, your name is

288
00:26:00,509 --> 00:26:01,759
Glenda.

289
00:26:06,348 --> 00:26:07,765
Run, Glenda.

290
00:26:18,402 --> 00:26:20,069
Jeez, what a mess.

291
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:22,071
Ugh.

292
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:30,496
There you are,
Mr. Goodbar.

293
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:51,225
Jennifer Tilly.

294
00:27:06,074 --> 00:27:07,533
Hello.

295
00:27:08,327 --> 00:27:09,368
Hey.

296
00:27:13,123 --> 00:27:16,334
Oh, my God.
You look so real.

297
00:27:17,627 --> 00:27:19,420
You look so real.

298
00:27:22,382 --> 00:27:24,842
You are cuter
than my last boyfriend.

299
00:27:24,926 --> 00:27:27,303
I think we make
a lovely couple.

300
00:27:43,445 --> 00:27:46,447
Jennifer. Miss Tilly, were
you having an affair with him?

301
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:49,200
I don't know
what you're talking about.

302
00:27:49,284 --> 00:27:50,701
Pete Peters,
Celebrities Revealed.

303
00:27:50,786 --> 00:27:52,036
Jennifer,
what did you see?

304
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,829
What, you want me
to draw you a picture?

305
00:27:53,955 --> 00:27:54,955
Would you?

306
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,457
Somebody give her
a piece of paper.

307
00:27:56,541 --> 00:27:58,459
Look, I'm not gonna
draw you a picture, okay?

308
00:27:58,543 --> 00:27:59,794
Oh, don't feel bad.

309
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:01,212
You're an actress
not an artist.

310
00:28:01,296 --> 00:28:03,464
What were you doin'
when you saw the body?

311
00:28:03,548 --> 00:28:05,049
No comment.

312
00:28:05,133 --> 00:28:07,093
Jennifer, I love you.
I...

313
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,971
Jennifer, I love you.

314
00:28:13,642 --> 00:28:15,768
Is it true that you and Redman
are in talks

315
00:28:15,852 --> 00:28:18,396
about you starring
in his new movie?

316
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:21,232
Yes. As a matter of
fact, that is true. I have...

317
00:28:21,316 --> 00:28:22,983
Can I have your autograph?

318
00:28:23,485 --> 00:28:24,944
Okay, sure.

319
00:28:29,324 --> 00:28:32,284
Hey, hold on,
you forgot the head.

320
00:28:36,206 --> 00:28:38,416
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Excuse me.

321
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,292
Jennifer,
how old are you really?

322
00:28:40,377 --> 00:28:41,419
Paparazzi scumbag!

323
00:28:41,503 --> 00:28:42,920
What year were you born?

324
00:28:43,004 --> 00:28:44,130
Give us the exact date.

325
00:28:44,214 --> 00:28:45,589
I want to sit up
front with you.

326
00:28:45,674 --> 00:28:47,007
Sure.

327
00:28:49,845 --> 00:28:51,345
What are you hiding?

328
00:28:55,308 --> 00:28:56,851
Hey, you okay?

329
00:28:57,185 --> 00:28:59,353
Yeah, I am now.

330
00:29:06,403 --> 00:29:08,487
We're on the boulevard

331
00:29:08,572 --> 00:29:10,322
We're cruisin' in my car

332
00:29:10,407 --> 00:29:13,451
See all the fellows turn
to look and see

333
00:29:16,705 --> 00:29:19,707
So, are you a pair
of ninja assassins?

334
00:29:20,041 --> 00:29:21,208
Huh?

335
00:29:21,501 --> 00:29:23,919
Are you hit men
for the yakuza?

336
00:29:24,004 --> 00:29:25,588
We're not from Japan.

337
00:29:25,714 --> 00:29:27,381
We're from Jersey.

338
00:29:27,757 --> 00:29:31,969
Just think, Jennifer Tilly
is playing me in a movie.

339
00:29:32,053 --> 00:29:34,388
It's absolutely
perfect casting.

340
00:29:34,473 --> 00:29:35,973
But that voice!

341
00:29:36,057 --> 00:29:39,977
I know, she sounds just
like an angel.

342
00:29:40,687 --> 00:29:42,980
Now, I've got it all
figured out.

343
00:29:43,064 --> 00:29:45,357
I'm going to transfer my soul
into Jennifer

344
00:29:45,442 --> 00:29:48,152
and you're going to transfer
your soul into Redman.

345
00:29:48,236 --> 00:29:49,570
I'm down with that.

346
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:52,281
We'll ditch these plastic
bodies once and for all,

347
00:29:52,365 --> 00:29:54,825
and we'll be
Hollywood's hottest couple.

348
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:56,160
What about me?

349
00:29:56,244 --> 00:29:57,661
Don't worry, Glenda.

350
00:29:57,746 --> 00:29:59,538
I've got that
figured out, too.

351
00:29:59,748 --> 00:30:02,750
You're going to be
a real live girl.

352
00:30:02,959 --> 00:30:04,001
Boy.

353
00:30:04,085 --> 00:30:05,044
How?

354
00:30:05,128 --> 00:30:08,839
Well, I'm not getting pregnant
again, I'll tell you that much.

355
00:30:08,924 --> 00:30:10,674
My mother always told me,

356
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:13,385
"Once is a blessing.
Twice is a curse. "

357
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:15,971
Well, that would explain
your sister.

358
00:30:16,056 --> 00:30:19,225
The only sensible option
is a surrogate mother.

359
00:30:26,775 --> 00:30:27,775
Hey.

360
00:30:30,654 --> 00:30:32,738
Jennifer, I have
something important...

361
00:30:32,822 --> 00:30:34,573
Yeah, hold on a second,
sweetheart.

362
00:30:39,162 --> 00:30:40,329
Hello?

363
00:30:40,413 --> 00:30:41,705
What are you doing?

364
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:42,957
I'm busy.

365
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:46,961
I do have a life,
you know.

366
00:30:47,128 --> 00:30:48,754
Turn on the news.

367
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:51,799
Were you
having an affair?

368
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:53,884
The actress
discovered the victim's body.

369
00:30:53,969 --> 00:30:56,095
As of yet, there is
no official confirmation

370
00:30:56,179 --> 00:30:58,264
as to whether or not
Miss Tilly is a suspect.

371
00:30:58,348 --> 00:30:59,348
Jesus!

372
00:30:59,432 --> 00:31:00,724
Can you believe this?

373
00:31:00,809 --> 00:31:01,892
Are you okay?

374
00:31:03,019 --> 00:31:04,395
I've had better days.

375
00:31:04,479 --> 00:31:07,022
Um, listen, Joan, I need you
to do something for me.

376
00:31:07,107 --> 00:31:08,983
I need you to get me
a bottle of champagne

377
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:10,901
and bring it by my house.

378
00:31:10,986 --> 00:31:12,278
What for?

379
00:31:13,196 --> 00:31:14,655
Well,

380
00:31:15,448 --> 00:31:16,907
I've got a big night tonight.

381
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:18,325
Tonight?

382
00:31:18,743 --> 00:31:20,077
With who?

383
00:31:20,287 --> 00:31:21,370
Redman.

384
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:25,749
Jennifer, what are you up to?

385
00:31:25,834 --> 00:31:27,418
Thank you, Joan.

386
00:31:31,006 --> 00:31:33,465
Oh, come on, Stan,
it's just business.

387
00:31:33,842 --> 00:31:36,260
He'll be out of there
by midnight.

388
00:31:39,973 --> 00:31:43,475
Oh, my God,
she's a complete slut.

389
00:32:00,535 --> 00:32:03,037
Nighty-night, Glenda.
Sleep tight.

390
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:06,206
Leave it on.

391
00:32:07,208 --> 00:32:10,586
Oh, sweetie, there's nothing
to be scared of.

392
00:32:10,879 --> 00:32:13,297
Your daddy and I
will be right here.

393
00:32:17,927 --> 00:32:19,845
Why do you kill people?

394
00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:22,556
Excuse me?

395
00:32:23,016 --> 00:32:24,391
Why do you kill?

396
00:32:29,022 --> 00:32:31,982
It's a hobby, really.
It helps us relax.

397
00:32:32,067 --> 00:32:33,984
Am I going to be a killer?

398
00:32:34,069 --> 00:32:37,738
Of course. It's been a family
tradition for generations.

399
00:32:38,031 --> 00:32:40,407
But violence is bad,
isn't it?

400
00:32:40,492 --> 00:32:41,950
They said so on TV.

401
00:32:42,035 --> 00:32:43,494
Not "violence. "

402
00:32:43,578 --> 00:32:46,997
"Violins. "
Violins are bad.

403
00:32:47,082 --> 00:32:50,542
That screeching music's gonna
ruin the goddamn country.

404
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,461
Chucky, Glenda's right.

405
00:32:52,545 --> 00:32:54,505
It's time
we owned up to it.

406
00:32:54,589 --> 00:32:57,091
We have a problem
with killing.

407
00:32:57,509 --> 00:33:00,719
I don't have "a problem"
with killing.

408
00:33:01,054 --> 00:33:03,764
I like a little killing
now and then.

409
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:05,015
What's wrong with that?

410
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:08,644
Killing is an addiction,
like any other drug.

411
00:33:09,062 --> 00:33:10,854
But we're parents now.

412
00:33:10,939 --> 00:33:13,232
We have to set
a good example.

413
00:33:14,776 --> 00:33:17,736
Oh, let's quit, Chucky,
right now.

414
00:33:17,904 --> 00:33:19,446
Cold turkey.

415
00:33:19,531 --> 00:33:21,782
You have got to be kidding.

416
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:23,826
Promise me, Chucky,
no more killing.

417
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:24,910
No.

418
00:33:24,994 --> 00:33:26,203
Chucky?
No, no.

419
00:33:26,287 --> 00:33:27,538
No more killing.
No, no.

420
00:33:27,622 --> 00:33:29,039
We can't do it anymore.
No, no.

421
00:33:29,124 --> 00:33:30,249
A thousand times no.

422
00:33:30,333 --> 00:33:32,584
We have the future to
think of. We have a child!

423
00:33:32,669 --> 00:33:33,711
Fine!

424
00:33:34,087 --> 00:33:36,338
All right, already.
I promise.

425
00:33:37,465 --> 00:33:38,841
Thank you, doll baby.

426
00:33:39,134 --> 00:33:40,467
You're
a sweetheart.

427
00:33:40,552 --> 00:33:43,595
Now we really will be
the perfect family.

428
00:33:51,896 --> 00:33:53,480
Did you hear that?

429
00:33:53,565 --> 00:33:55,315
Maybe you should
forget the director

430
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,484
and fuck
the exterminator instead.

431
00:33:57,986 --> 00:33:59,653
So, how do I look?

432
00:34:00,405 --> 00:34:01,405
Never mind.

433
00:34:01,489 --> 00:34:03,449
Jennifer,
this is beneath you.

434
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:05,784
Think about what you're doing.

435
00:34:05,869 --> 00:34:07,578
What are people gonna say?

436
00:34:07,662 --> 00:34:09,705
Who cares what people say?

437
00:34:09,956 --> 00:34:12,166
But don't you see
how evil this is?

438
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,500
I don't wanna hear it.

439
00:34:13,585 --> 00:34:15,085
You're prostituting yourself

440
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:17,296
so you can play
the Virgin Mary.

441
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:18,964
Joan, I don't
wanna hear it.

442
00:34:19,048 --> 00:34:20,883
Oh, this is so evil.

443
00:34:21,926 --> 00:34:23,552
You're going to hell.
No.

444
00:34:23,636 --> 00:34:26,346
Hell would be ending up
on Celebrity Fear Factor

445
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:28,599
in a worm-eating contest
with Anna Nicole Smith.

446
00:34:29,809 --> 00:34:31,435
Which you'd win.

447
00:34:36,524 --> 00:34:37,858
He's here.

448
00:34:38,359 --> 00:34:40,277
Let yourself out the back.

449
00:34:41,529 --> 00:34:42,821
And while you're at it,

450
00:34:42,906 --> 00:34:45,199
why don't you leave
your key on the counter?

451
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:46,784
What are you saying?

452
00:34:46,868 --> 00:34:49,328
Well, you think
I'm so disgusting.

453
00:34:49,412 --> 00:34:51,538
You think
I'm going to hell.

454
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:53,916
I'm only trying
to survive here, Joan.

455
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,127
God knows I wouldn't want to
drag you down with me.

456
00:34:57,212 --> 00:34:59,213
I'm saying you're fired.

457
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:08,347
Cut 'em up

458
00:35:12,769 --> 00:35:15,229
I'm gonna hit that ass

459
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:26,240
Now, in artificial insemination,
timing is everything.

460
00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:28,033
So you'll have to hurry.

461
00:35:28,117 --> 00:35:30,160
That shouldn't be
a problem for you.

462
00:35:30,245 --> 00:35:33,580
Yeah, yeah, just don't let
that player get into her pants.

463
00:35:33,665 --> 00:35:35,624
I don't want him
touching my woman

464
00:35:35,708 --> 00:35:37,334
till I'm him
and you're her.

465
00:35:37,418 --> 00:35:38,627
Right.

466
00:35:44,259 --> 00:35:45,425
Hey.

467
00:35:45,802 --> 00:35:48,220
Aren't you going to give me
a hand here?

468
00:35:59,274 --> 00:36:00,691
Mmm.

469
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:03,443
Too tall.

470
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,113
Hey, lezbos.

471
00:36:09,868 --> 00:36:11,118
Done her.

472
00:36:15,832 --> 00:36:17,291
Here we go.

473
00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:20,961
Come to papa.

474
00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:04,630
Cheers.

475
00:37:05,924 --> 00:37:09,676
You know, I wasn't bullshittin'
when I told you I was a fan.

476
00:37:09,886 --> 00:37:11,887
Oh, That's so sweet,
Redman.

477
00:37:12,347 --> 00:37:14,473
Which of my films
is your favorite?

478
00:37:14,557 --> 00:37:17,059
That movie when you and
that chick was makin' out.

479
00:37:17,143 --> 00:37:20,062
Oh, Bound.
Everybody likes that one.

480
00:37:20,146 --> 00:37:21,939
You still in
touch with homegirl?

481
00:37:22,023 --> 00:37:23,023
Gina?
Yeah.

482
00:37:23,107 --> 00:37:24,316
Oh, yeah,
sure, we're friends.

483
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,943
Wow.
Close friends.

484
00:37:26,027 --> 00:37:26,985
Whoa.

485
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:29,029
Very close friends.

486
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:31,365
Maybe, the three of us

487
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:33,575
could hang out
together some time.

488
00:37:34,869 --> 00:37:37,496
You know, I would really
like that a lot.

489
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:40,624
Okay. I'll see
if I can make it happen.

490
00:37:40,708 --> 00:37:41,917
Bottoms up, baby.

491
00:37:42,001 --> 00:37:43,043
Skol.

492
00:37:43,711 --> 00:37:45,587
Redman, um,

493
00:37:46,089 --> 00:37:48,799
I was wondering
what's it gonna take

494
00:37:48,883 --> 00:37:51,134
to make you see me
as a virgin.

495
00:37:51,928 --> 00:37:53,553
Well, you tell me.

496
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:29,256
A masturbating midget?

497
00:38:37,348 --> 00:38:39,016
Get it, mini-meat.

498
00:38:46,566 --> 00:38:47,733
Whoa.

499
00:38:53,114 --> 00:38:56,199
Oh, sweet Jesus,
God bless the little people.

500
00:39:00,246 --> 00:39:01,830
I don't know
if I can do this.

501
00:39:01,914 --> 00:39:03,373
Why not?

502
00:39:04,625 --> 00:39:06,376
What will people say?

503
00:39:06,461 --> 00:39:08,211
Man, fuck what people say.

504
00:39:08,296 --> 00:39:10,797
Know what I'm saying? This was
meant to be, baby, for real.

505
00:39:10,882 --> 00:39:12,049
Know how I know?

506
00:39:12,133 --> 00:39:14,217
Because the man upstairs
told me so.

507
00:39:14,302 --> 00:39:15,260
Really?

508
00:39:15,344 --> 00:39:16,678
Hell, yeah.

509
00:39:16,804 --> 00:39:18,889
Look,
Mel Gibson ain't the only one

510
00:39:18,973 --> 00:39:20,932
God's been talkin' to
in Hollywood.

511
00:39:21,017 --> 00:39:24,561
And He personally told me
that you was my Virgin.

512
00:39:25,063 --> 00:39:26,438
Well, I guess...

513
00:39:31,486 --> 00:39:32,986
What the hell?

514
00:39:39,786 --> 00:39:40,994
Pig.

515
00:39:41,996 --> 00:39:43,497
And you...

516
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:46,249
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

517
00:39:46,334 --> 00:39:48,460
Where's your self-respect?

518
00:39:49,087 --> 00:39:52,547
You know what my mother used
to say about dirty girls?

519
00:39:52,673 --> 00:39:55,675
She said,
"You can always smell it

520
00:39:55,927 --> 00:39:58,428
"on girls who sell it. "

521
00:39:59,472 --> 00:40:02,682
Um, by the way, Miss Tilly,
can I have your autograph?

522
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:04,226
I'm a big fan.

523
00:40:11,192 --> 00:40:13,318
What am I
supposed to do with this?

524
00:40:28,376 --> 00:40:31,419
Now, Miss Tilly,
I know you're frightened.

525
00:40:31,504 --> 00:40:33,088
You're probably
even wondering

526
00:40:33,172 --> 00:40:35,423
if you've gone
completely insane.

527
00:40:35,508 --> 00:40:38,635
But I promise you, tomorrow
you're going to wake up,

528
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:41,429
and this will all seem
just like a bad dream.

529
00:40:41,514 --> 00:40:44,975
In the meantime,
we can do this the easy way

530
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:47,644
or the hard way.

531
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:51,064
It's really up to you.

532
00:40:58,739 --> 00:41:01,158
No wonder
her career's in trouble.

533
00:41:05,413 --> 00:41:07,164
Check it out, Tiff.

534
00:41:07,248 --> 00:41:09,583
Look at the size
of his feet.

535
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:11,418
You know what they say.

536
00:41:12,587 --> 00:41:14,212
Fuck, she's fat.

537
00:41:15,423 --> 00:41:18,091
I can't believe it.
She's not even pregnant yet.

538
00:41:24,473 --> 00:41:26,433
Paparazzi scumbag.

539
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:38,528
Uh, looks like you've got
everything under control.

540
00:41:38,613 --> 00:41:40,655
I'll just leave you to it.

541
00:41:45,953 --> 00:41:48,830
Motherhood is so beautiful.

542
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:56,922
No.

543
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:58,965
No.

544
00:42:00,134 --> 00:42:01,134
No.

545
00:42:02,803 --> 00:42:03,803
No.

546
00:42:12,605 --> 00:42:15,148
Sorry, just messin'
with you.

547
00:42:15,775 --> 00:42:17,400
What time is it?

548
00:42:20,321 --> 00:42:22,113
Time to get dressed.

549
00:42:23,157 --> 00:42:27,244
We are going to have our own
boys' night out, just you and me.

550
00:42:27,328 --> 00:42:28,870
How does that sound?

551
00:42:28,955 --> 00:42:30,205
Where are we going?

552
00:42:30,331 --> 00:42:31,665
Hunting.

553
00:42:39,423 --> 00:42:41,174
I can't see anything.

554
00:42:41,801 --> 00:42:43,635
Maybe we should slow down?

555
00:42:43,719 --> 00:42:45,553
No! You're doing great.

556
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:56,273
Son of a bitch!

557
00:42:59,277 --> 00:43:00,986
Up yours, asshole!

558
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,279
What?

559
00:43:02,363 --> 00:43:04,739
Not you, Son.
Come on, floor it!

560
00:43:21,757 --> 00:43:23,550
Oops! I did it again.

561
00:44:10,931 --> 00:44:13,266
Jesus Christ!

562
00:44:54,016 --> 00:44:55,058
No!

563
00:45:19,959 --> 00:45:21,167
Attaboy!

564
00:45:22,128 --> 00:45:23,670
No, I didn't.

565
00:45:23,754 --> 00:45:25,463
And I thought
you weren't ready.

566
00:45:25,548 --> 00:45:28,675
Kid, you're
a fuckin' natural!

567
00:45:28,926 --> 00:45:30,718
But he... he
hit the shelf.

568
00:45:30,803 --> 00:45:32,720
And don't worry
about your mother.

569
00:45:32,847 --> 00:45:34,806
It will be
our little secret.

570
00:45:41,147 --> 00:45:42,939
Say "cheese. "

571
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,463
Good morning.

572
00:46:06,881 --> 00:46:08,673
Oh. Hi.

573
00:46:09,884 --> 00:46:12,093
We must have really
got wired last night.

574
00:46:12,178 --> 00:46:13,261
Yeah.

575
00:46:14,388 --> 00:46:16,222
Redman, did we...

576
00:46:17,141 --> 00:46:18,391
You don't...
You don't remember?

577
00:46:18,476 --> 00:46:20,810
No. It's all a blur.

578
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:23,396
What about you?

579
00:46:23,564 --> 00:46:26,232
I kind of remember
you screamin' a lot.

580
00:46:26,609 --> 00:46:28,985
Oh, yeah,
I seem to remember that, too.

581
00:46:29,069 --> 00:46:31,571
You know, I tend to have
that effect on women.

582
00:46:32,198 --> 00:46:33,156
Really?

583
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:34,407
Yeah.

584
00:46:36,202 --> 00:46:39,412
Wait, I do remember

585
00:46:40,498 --> 00:46:42,582
I had the strangest dream.

586
00:46:43,459 --> 00:46:46,085
I dreamt my guardian angel
came to me.

587
00:46:46,962 --> 00:46:49,923
She had the sweetest voice
I have ever heard.

588
00:46:50,633 --> 00:46:52,842
She told me to
respect myself.

589
00:46:54,261 --> 00:46:56,513
And then she asked
for my autograph.

590
00:46:57,431 --> 00:46:58,431
Let's see.

591
00:46:58,682 --> 00:47:02,101
"Step Number One:
Admit I have an addiction. "

592
00:47:02,311 --> 00:47:03,645
Okay, check.

593
00:47:03,729 --> 00:47:05,188
"Step Number Two:

594
00:47:05,272 --> 00:47:07,982
"Give myself over
to a higher power. "

595
00:47:08,567 --> 00:47:09,817
Whatever.

596
00:47:13,697 --> 00:47:15,782
Oh. Here we go.

597
00:47:15,866 --> 00:47:18,576
"Step Number Nine:

598
00:47:18,661 --> 00:47:21,538
"The recovering addict
must make amends

599
00:47:21,622 --> 00:47:24,791
"to anyone he or she
has harmed. "

600
00:47:25,793 --> 00:47:26,793
Hmm.

601
00:47:36,178 --> 00:47:37,220
Hello?

602
00:47:37,304 --> 00:47:38,304
Good morning.

603
00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:39,681
Is this Ruth Bailey?

604
00:47:39,765 --> 00:47:40,848
Speaking.

605
00:47:40,933 --> 00:47:42,684
The widow of Robert Bailey?

606
00:47:42,768 --> 00:47:44,477
Yes. Who is this?

607
00:47:44,979 --> 00:47:47,814
Mrs. Bailey,
my name is Tiffany Ray.

608
00:47:48,107 --> 00:47:49,649
Um, you don't know me,

609
00:47:49,733 --> 00:47:52,068
but a few years ago,
I killed your husband.

610
00:47:52,152 --> 00:47:55,321
And I am
so very, very sorry.

611
00:47:55,614 --> 00:47:57,824
What is this,
some kind of sick joke?

612
00:47:57,908 --> 00:48:01,035
Oh, no,
I'm completely serious.

613
00:48:01,245 --> 00:48:04,789
But I want you to know
I'm in recovery now

614
00:48:04,957 --> 00:48:07,166
and I have put all of that
behind me.

615
00:48:07,334 --> 00:48:09,586
I don't know
who you are...

616
00:48:10,838 --> 00:48:12,505
Thank you, Mrs. Bailey.

617
00:48:12,673 --> 00:48:14,340
Have a nice day.

618
00:48:17,094 --> 00:48:18,970
I feel better already.

619
00:48:33,902 --> 00:48:35,403
Morning, Stan.

620
00:48:35,904 --> 00:48:37,780
Hey, wasn't there
something important

621
00:48:37,865 --> 00:48:39,449
you wanted to tell me?

622
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:41,701
Well, uh,

623
00:48:42,453 --> 00:48:44,203
the thing is, Jennifer...

624
00:48:50,294 --> 00:48:51,961
I'm sorry.

625
00:48:52,046 --> 00:48:54,505
I don't know
what's gotten into me.

626
00:48:54,757 --> 00:48:57,508
Um, so you were saying...

627
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:01,054
Forget it.

628
00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:02,597
Okay.

629
00:49:05,684 --> 00:49:08,311
Now, let's see.

630
00:49:09,021 --> 00:49:11,773
What should we
do today?

631
00:49:37,925 --> 00:49:39,384
I'm pregnant.

632
00:49:41,637 --> 00:49:44,013
Redman, I said
I'm pregnant.

633
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:46,724
Congratulations.

634
00:49:46,809 --> 00:49:48,309
Who is the baby's daddy?

635
00:49:50,187 --> 00:49:51,938
Don't even look at me.

636
00:49:52,439 --> 00:49:54,107
Well, I haven't slept
with anyone else

637
00:49:54,191 --> 00:49:56,067
to advance
my career lately.

638
00:49:56,193 --> 00:49:57,443
Who are you kidding?

639
00:49:57,528 --> 00:49:58,986
It's true, Redman.
Look,

640
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:01,864
I know I come off
all slutty,

641
00:50:01,949 --> 00:50:04,617
but that's... that's
for my image. It's just...

642
00:50:04,743 --> 00:50:06,536
Do you think
anyone would cast me

643
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:07,704
in these sexpot roles

644
00:50:07,788 --> 00:50:10,623
if they knew I hadn't
been laid in a year?

645
00:50:11,083 --> 00:50:13,710
I haven't even slept
with my driver yet

646
00:50:13,794 --> 00:50:15,795
and I think
he really likes me.

647
00:50:15,879 --> 00:50:17,672
Hey, that's all very
touchin' and shit.

648
00:50:17,756 --> 00:50:19,799
But I'm telling you,
it can't be me.

649
00:50:20,217 --> 00:50:21,426
Why not?

650
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:23,720
I had a vasectomy
as soon as I got to Hollywood.

651
00:50:23,804 --> 00:50:25,096
I ain't no idiot.

652
00:50:26,014 --> 00:50:28,141
Well, then,
that's impossible. I...

653
00:50:28,225 --> 00:50:29,934
Hey, Jennifer,

654
00:50:30,269 --> 00:50:31,561
I hate to break it to you.

655
00:50:31,645 --> 00:50:33,855
But I can't hire you
if you're pregnant.

656
00:50:34,565 --> 00:50:36,190
That is ridiculous.

657
00:50:36,316 --> 00:50:37,942
The character is pregnant.

658
00:50:38,026 --> 00:50:39,444
Yeah, I know,

659
00:50:39,528 --> 00:50:42,321
but I have a very specific
vision of Mary.

660
00:50:42,990 --> 00:50:44,282
And what can I say?

661
00:50:44,366 --> 00:50:45,950
She gots to be hot.

662
00:50:52,249 --> 00:50:53,708
That pig!

663
00:51:13,395 --> 00:51:14,812
Recovery Hotline.

664
00:51:14,897 --> 00:51:16,105
Yes, I'm in recovery.

665
00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:18,024
And I'm afraid
I'm going to have a slip.

666
00:51:19,193 --> 00:51:20,777
Can you
get to a meeting?

667
00:51:20,861 --> 00:51:23,696
No, it's really
not an option.

668
00:51:23,864 --> 00:51:26,574
I just freak everybody out.

669
00:51:26,658 --> 00:51:27,992
Don't be
so hard on yourself.

670
00:51:28,076 --> 00:51:29,243
We're not here
to judge you.

671
00:51:29,328 --> 00:51:30,369
What's your name?

672
00:51:30,454 --> 00:51:31,454
Tiffany.

673
00:51:31,538 --> 00:51:32,789
Listen to me, Tiffany.

674
00:51:32,873 --> 00:51:35,124
I know exactly what
you are going through.

675
00:51:35,209 --> 00:51:36,250
You do?

676
00:51:36,335 --> 00:51:37,335
Yes, I... I do.

677
00:51:37,419 --> 00:51:39,962
In fact, I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret.

678
00:51:40,047 --> 00:51:41,464
Just last week,
I had a slip.

679
00:51:41,548 --> 00:51:42,590
Really?

680
00:51:42,674 --> 00:51:43,674
Yes.

681
00:51:43,759 --> 00:51:46,010
And believe you me,
it was not pretty.

682
00:51:46,094 --> 00:51:47,970
It never is, is it?

683
00:51:48,055 --> 00:51:51,474
In fact, it took me 3 hours
just to clean up the mess.

684
00:51:52,768 --> 00:51:55,269
Oh, God, don't remind me.

685
00:51:56,438 --> 00:51:58,481
But I'm not beating myself up
over it.

686
00:51:58,565 --> 00:51:59,649
You know why, Tiffany?

687
00:51:59,733 --> 00:52:00,733
Why?

688
00:52:01,026 --> 00:52:03,736
Because Rome
wasn't built in a day.

689
00:52:06,073 --> 00:52:07,490
You're right.

690
00:52:08,367 --> 00:52:10,576
You are absolutely right.

691
00:52:20,462 --> 00:52:22,630
Hello? Speaking.

692
00:52:23,632 --> 00:52:25,132
Well, who's this?

693
00:52:25,926 --> 00:52:27,176
All right, I know.

694
00:52:27,261 --> 00:52:28,386
I understand who you are.

695
00:52:28,470 --> 00:52:31,138
I just don't know
how you got my phone number.

696
00:52:31,223 --> 00:52:34,058
Because it is a private,
unlisted phone number.

697
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:37,019
Pete Peters?

698
00:52:37,145 --> 00:52:38,688
Yeah, I saw him yesterday.

699
00:52:40,274 --> 00:52:42,817
No, I don't have
any relationship with him.

700
00:52:42,901 --> 00:52:44,360
He is a firking
paparazzi

701
00:52:44,444 --> 00:52:46,028
that is trying to
get pictures of me

702
00:52:46,113 --> 00:52:48,281
in compromising positions.

703
00:52:49,116 --> 00:52:51,325
Yeah, I'm with Redman.

704
00:52:51,451 --> 00:52:53,786
Redman, he's a director.

705
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:56,581
Oh, yeah.
Well, he's a rapper, too.

706
00:52:56,874 --> 00:52:58,791
He is a rapper-director,
okay?

707
00:52:58,876 --> 00:53:00,459
He's a hyphenate.

708
00:53:03,964 --> 00:53:05,256
Bye-bye.

709
00:53:09,219 --> 00:53:10,636
Jennifer...

710
00:53:11,138 --> 00:53:13,389
Do you mind?
I'm on the phone.

711
00:53:22,316 --> 00:53:24,442
There's been another murder.

712
00:53:24,568 --> 00:53:26,736
What?
No, I told you where I was.

713
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:29,488
I was right here all night
with Redman.

714
00:53:30,032 --> 00:53:32,783
What? I don't...

715
00:53:33,493 --> 00:53:36,037
You're not telling me
I'm a suspect.

716
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:39,540
All right, I'll be fine.

717
00:53:39,666 --> 00:53:41,208
I'm on my way.

718
00:53:42,085 --> 00:53:43,294
I'm leaving.

719
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:44,587
You can let yourself out.

720
00:53:44,671 --> 00:53:47,632
By the way,
Redman, drop dead.

721
00:53:54,932 --> 00:53:56,766
Oh, Glenda.

722
00:53:57,059 --> 00:54:00,686
Glenda, honey.
Everything is okay.

723
00:54:01,355 --> 00:54:03,481
It was just a little slip.

724
00:54:03,607 --> 00:54:05,733
There's no need
to tell your daddy.

725
00:54:05,901 --> 00:54:08,069
It will be our
little secret, okay?

726
00:54:08,153 --> 00:54:10,363
Okay? Shh.

727
00:54:22,209 --> 00:54:24,543
It's
D- day here at San Quentin.

728
00:54:24,628 --> 00:54:27,129
Who would have thought
it would ever come to this?

729
00:54:27,214 --> 00:54:30,174
They're executing
Martha Stewart this morning.

730
00:54:31,385 --> 00:54:34,637
I don't think I can take
nine months of this shit.

731
00:54:35,430 --> 00:54:36,806
Silly Chucky.

732
00:54:36,890 --> 00:54:38,849
It is
a voodoo pregnancy.

733
00:54:38,934 --> 00:54:40,559
It's accelerated.

734
00:54:40,686 --> 00:54:42,269
How accelerated?

735
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:44,730
It is 102.7, KllSFM,

736
00:54:44,815 --> 00:54:46,190
LA's number one
hit music station.

737
00:54:46,274 --> 00:54:47,566
Ryan Seacrest in the morning.

738
00:54:47,651 --> 00:54:49,485
Ellen K., I don't know
if I can take it.

739
00:54:49,569 --> 00:54:50,569
What's on the way?

740
00:54:50,654 --> 00:54:53,364
We have bad
weather on the way in LA, Hollywood,

741
00:54:53,448 --> 00:54:54,490
and surrounding area.

742
00:54:54,574 --> 00:54:56,701
Now, we're
not used to bad weather.

743
00:54:56,785 --> 00:54:57,785
No, we're not.

744
00:54:57,869 --> 00:55:00,871
I'm not quite sure how that's
going to affect my whole vibe.

745
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:10,840
Oh.

746
00:55:21,226 --> 00:55:22,351
This is Joan.

747
00:55:22,436 --> 00:55:23,978
Joan. Joan, I'm...

748
00:55:24,062 --> 00:55:25,563
I'm... I'm fat.

749
00:55:25,647 --> 00:55:26,856
You're not fat.

750
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:29,191
No, I am fat.
I'm... I'm huge!

751
00:55:29,276 --> 00:55:31,736
For the love of Mary,
I'm pregnant.

752
00:55:31,987 --> 00:55:33,154
Oh, my God.

753
00:55:33,238 --> 00:55:34,947
No, I should have
listened to you, Joan.

754
00:55:35,032 --> 00:55:37,158
You said it was evil
and I was going to hell.

755
00:55:37,242 --> 00:55:40,202
You're right,
and now God is punishing me.

756
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:42,163
Oh, God.
Is it Redman's?

757
00:55:42,247 --> 00:55:44,206
No, it's definitely
not Redman's.

758
00:55:44,291 --> 00:55:45,374
What?
What?

759
00:55:45,459 --> 00:55:46,876
It's definitely
not Redman's.

760
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:48,335
What an asshole.

761
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:49,920
W- What makes you
say that?

762
00:55:50,005 --> 00:55:51,005
Say what?

763
00:55:51,089 --> 00:55:52,256
That Redman is
an asshole.

764
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:53,841
I didn't say it,
you did.

765
00:55:53,925 --> 00:55:54,967
No, I didn't.

766
00:55:55,052 --> 00:55:56,052
So he's not
an asshole?

767
00:55:56,136 --> 00:55:57,470
Yes, he is.

768
00:55:57,554 --> 00:55:59,638
Joan, will you please
stop doing that?

769
00:55:59,723 --> 00:56:00,723
Doing what?

770
00:56:00,807 --> 00:56:03,059
Imitating me.
I do not sound like that.

771
00:56:03,143 --> 00:56:05,269
Oh, yes, you do.
I do.

772
00:56:05,353 --> 00:56:06,812
Joan, will you shut up?

773
00:56:06,897 --> 00:56:08,981
There's something
really wrong with me!

774
00:56:09,066 --> 00:56:10,775
I'm pregnant. I don't...

775
00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:13,611
Jennifer, what's wrong?

776
00:56:14,946 --> 00:56:16,906
Nothing.
Nothing, I'm fine.

777
00:56:16,990 --> 00:56:18,449
I heard you scream.

778
00:56:18,533 --> 00:56:20,076
I can still
hear you screaming!

779
00:56:22,329 --> 00:56:23,913
Oh. Oh, I mean, it's just...

780
00:56:23,997 --> 00:56:25,414
Well, Bound is on cable.

781
00:56:25,499 --> 00:56:27,666
Gina Gershon
is fingering me.

782
00:56:29,503 --> 00:56:31,670
I love this movie. Don't you?

783
00:56:34,341 --> 00:56:35,341
Jennifer.

784
00:56:35,425 --> 00:56:37,134
Yeah, uh-huh,
that's really interesting,

785
00:56:37,219 --> 00:56:39,053
but I've got to go. Bye.

786
00:56:40,555 --> 00:56:41,680
Jennifer.

787
00:56:44,142 --> 00:56:45,226
Too tight?

788
00:56:45,310 --> 00:56:46,435
Yes.

789
00:56:47,229 --> 00:56:49,522
Ain't no such thing.

790
00:56:53,693 --> 00:56:56,654
What are you doing?
Stop it.

791
00:56:57,489 --> 00:56:59,907
What the hell is
going on in here?

792
00:57:01,034 --> 00:57:03,661
She, um,
came on to me.

793
00:57:03,745 --> 00:57:05,830
Help me!
Somebody help me!

794
00:57:05,914 --> 00:57:07,206
Shut her up,
asshole.

795
00:57:07,874 --> 00:57:11,043
Help me! Somebody help me!

796
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:13,629
Somebody help me!

797
00:57:20,011 --> 00:57:21,929
What the hell
is this?

798
00:57:22,055 --> 00:57:23,973
We had an agreement,
Chucky.

799
00:57:24,057 --> 00:57:26,892
We decided,
for the sake of our child

800
00:57:27,018 --> 00:57:29,979
we weren't going
to do this shit anymore!

801
00:57:30,063 --> 00:57:31,939
No, you decided.

802
00:57:32,065 --> 00:57:35,442
Just like you decided
our son was a girl.

803
00:57:35,527 --> 00:57:36,819
He is a girl!

804
00:57:36,903 --> 00:57:38,320
He is a boy, God damn it!

805
00:57:38,405 --> 00:57:40,865
And he is
the most promising killer

806
00:57:40,949 --> 00:57:42,616
I have ever seen.

807
00:57:42,701 --> 00:57:44,743
You should have
been there, Tiff.

808
00:57:44,870 --> 00:57:46,912
You would have been
so proud of him.

809
00:57:47,038 --> 00:57:48,581
I want a girl!

810
00:57:48,707 --> 00:57:50,207
I want a boy!

811
00:57:50,292 --> 00:57:52,710
You are tearing me apart!

812
00:57:52,919 --> 00:57:55,504
What about what I want?

813
00:57:56,006 --> 00:57:57,006
What?

814
00:57:57,090 --> 00:57:58,048
What?

815
00:57:58,133 --> 00:58:00,926
Doesn't what I want
mean anything at all?

816
00:58:01,094 --> 00:58:02,094
Oh.

817
00:58:02,387 --> 00:58:05,264
Okay, interesting.
Tell us.

818
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:07,892
What do you want,
Sweetface?

819
00:58:08,476 --> 00:58:12,521
I think
I want to be a boy.

820
00:58:12,939 --> 00:58:15,816
Yes!
In your face, lady!

821
00:58:16,193 --> 00:58:19,278
But being a girl
would be nice, too.

822
00:58:19,738 --> 00:58:20,738
Hmm.

823
00:58:20,822 --> 00:58:22,489
Well, which is it?

824
00:58:22,824 --> 00:58:24,116
I'm not sure.

825
00:58:24,201 --> 00:58:25,784
Sometimes I feel
like a boy.

826
00:58:26,077 --> 00:58:28,287
Sometimes I feel
like a girl.

827
00:58:29,831 --> 00:58:31,207
Can't I be both?

828
00:58:31,291 --> 00:58:33,209
Well, some people...

829
00:58:33,335 --> 00:58:35,294
Uh-uh!
No way.

830
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:37,880
But one thing
I do know for sure.

831
00:58:37,964 --> 00:58:40,174
I don't want
to be a killer.

832
00:58:41,301 --> 00:58:44,553
Glenda.
Glen. Whatever.

833
00:58:44,638 --> 00:58:46,472
I'm so proud of you.

834
00:58:46,806 --> 00:58:48,557
No matter what happens,

835
00:58:48,642 --> 00:58:52,144
we'll deal with it together,
as a family.

836
00:58:52,479 --> 00:58:53,938
Okay, Okasan.

837
00:58:55,523 --> 00:58:56,732
Wait a minute.

838
00:58:56,816 --> 00:58:59,777
I'm not going to let you
poison our son's mind

839
00:58:59,861 --> 00:59:02,571
with your touchy-feely,
12-step bullshit.

840
00:59:02,656 --> 00:59:04,615
If you two don't want
to kill anymore,

841
00:59:04,699 --> 00:59:05,783
that's your loss.

842
00:59:05,867 --> 00:59:08,869
But don't look
down your noses at me.

843
00:59:08,954 --> 00:59:10,871
I'm not ashamed
to be a killer.

844
00:59:11,289 --> 00:59:12,623
I'm proud of it.

845
00:59:12,707 --> 00:59:14,541
It is not an addiction.

846
00:59:14,626 --> 00:59:15,918
It is a choice.

847
00:59:16,002 --> 00:59:17,628
And it is not something

848
00:59:17,712 --> 00:59:20,297
that you should have to
hide in a closet!

849
00:59:21,841 --> 00:59:22,883
Whoa!

850
00:59:25,679 --> 00:59:26,679
Oh.

851
00:59:27,138 --> 00:59:28,347
Oh, dear.

852
00:59:28,515 --> 00:59:29,765
Oh, God.

853
00:59:32,018 --> 00:59:34,561
Well, well, well.

854
00:59:34,646 --> 00:59:37,523
Looks like
Miss High and Mighty

855
00:59:37,607 --> 00:59:39,608
ain't so perfect
after all.

856
00:59:39,693 --> 00:59:41,527
It was just
a little slip.

857
00:59:41,611 --> 00:59:44,280
Rome wasn't built in a day,
you know.

858
00:59:44,906 --> 00:59:47,491
Besides, the fucker
really had it coming.

859
00:59:53,373 --> 00:59:54,873
Well, what about
my body?

860
00:59:55,041 --> 00:59:56,542
I'll take care of it.

861
01:00:03,341 --> 01:00:05,968
Jennifer, I love you.
Jennifer, I love you.

862
01:00:07,178 --> 01:00:08,554
I love you.

863
01:00:10,598 --> 01:00:12,099
This is Stan.

864
01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:15,227
Hello, it's Jennifer.

865
01:00:16,563 --> 01:00:19,940
Stan, baby, I need your body.

866
01:00:21,568 --> 01:00:23,319
I'll be right there.

867
01:00:30,118 --> 01:00:32,703
Jennifer,
if anything happens to me,

868
01:00:32,787 --> 01:00:33,996
I want you to know...

869
01:00:37,625 --> 01:00:39,585
They really
do make a cute couple,

870
01:00:39,669 --> 01:00:40,669
don't you think?

871
01:00:40,754 --> 01:00:42,212
It's like my
mother always said...

872
01:00:42,297 --> 01:00:43,589
Christ!

873
01:00:43,673 --> 01:00:45,549
Enough with your mother,
already.

874
01:00:45,633 --> 01:00:47,343
I killed that bitch
20 years ago

875
01:00:47,427 --> 01:00:48,927
and she still won't shut up.

876
01:00:54,267 --> 01:00:57,478
There, there.
It won't be long now.

877
01:01:08,448 --> 01:01:09,823
Jennifer!

878
01:01:15,663 --> 01:01:16,872
Jennifer!

879
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,167
Who is it?

880
01:01:20,251 --> 01:01:21,335
Jennifer.

881
01:01:21,419 --> 01:01:23,670
It's that nosy bitch, Joan.

882
01:01:24,839 --> 01:01:26,757
I'll take care of her.

883
01:01:26,841 --> 01:01:28,217
I wouldn't want you

884
01:01:28,301 --> 01:01:30,969
to violate
your delicate sensibilities.

885
01:01:36,142 --> 01:01:37,393
Jennifer!

886
01:01:56,830 --> 01:01:57,996
Jennifer.

887
01:02:04,754 --> 01:02:05,754
Jennifer!

888
01:02:41,666 --> 01:02:42,666
Jennifer.

889
01:02:52,469 --> 01:02:53,552
Oh, my God.

890
01:03:01,728 --> 01:03:02,728
Jennifer.

891
01:03:04,564 --> 01:03:06,398
Look out behind you!

892
01:03:06,733 --> 01:03:08,233
Joan!

893
01:03:10,153 --> 01:03:11,153
No!

894
01:03:24,083 --> 01:03:25,250
Dang!

895
01:03:28,087 --> 01:03:30,714
Look, I'm not going to
give you crap.

896
01:03:32,467 --> 01:03:34,426
Nobody is perfect, Tiff.

897
01:03:35,220 --> 01:03:38,013
I got a few skeletons
in the closet myself.

898
01:03:44,062 --> 01:03:45,103
See?

899
01:03:45,772 --> 01:03:47,189
Well, come on, Tiff.

900
01:03:47,273 --> 01:03:50,108
How long did it take
to build Rome, anyway?

901
01:03:51,319 --> 01:03:52,319
Tiff.

902
01:03:57,283 --> 01:03:58,450
Glen?

903
01:03:58,618 --> 01:04:01,286
Guess again, Daddy.

904
01:04:02,539 --> 01:04:03,914
Glenda?

905
01:04:04,207 --> 01:04:05,707
That's my name.

906
01:04:05,833 --> 01:04:07,376
Don't you wear it out.

907
01:04:08,378 --> 01:04:09,711
Oh, shit.

908
01:04:13,591 --> 01:04:14,967
What did I miss?

909
01:04:15,051 --> 01:04:19,054
Oh, nothing much.
I just fired Joan.

910
01:04:23,393 --> 01:04:25,811
Looks like you
win after all, Tiff.

911
01:04:25,895 --> 01:04:27,729
Congratulations.

912
01:04:27,814 --> 01:04:29,606
Oh, you both win.

913
01:04:29,774 --> 01:04:32,734
I'm a real lady-killer

914
01:04:32,819 --> 01:04:34,736
if you catch my drift.

915
01:04:34,821 --> 01:04:38,073
I'm a bona fide bonus baby.

916
01:04:40,827 --> 01:04:44,288
Jesus Christ, Chucky,
what did you do to him?

917
01:04:44,372 --> 01:04:45,539
What did I do?

918
01:04:45,623 --> 01:04:46,623
Hmm.

919
01:04:46,708 --> 01:04:48,166
At least I spent time
with the kid.

920
01:04:50,003 --> 01:04:51,795
Glen, wake up.

921
01:04:52,338 --> 01:04:53,880
Stop it, Mommy.

922
01:04:53,965 --> 01:04:56,133
You'll wrinkle
my dress.

923
01:04:56,509 --> 01:04:58,427
Oh, and how
do you like it?

924
01:04:58,511 --> 01:05:00,095
I made it meself.

925
01:05:00,179 --> 01:05:02,556
Like mother,
like daughter, right?

926
01:05:03,683 --> 01:05:05,434
Like mother,
like daughter.

927
01:05:05,518 --> 01:05:07,686
Get it?
"Mother and daughter. "

928
01:05:10,148 --> 01:05:12,107
I said, wake up! Right now.

929
01:05:21,951 --> 01:05:24,077
Mom? Dad?

930
01:05:38,384 --> 01:05:39,718
What am I?

931
01:05:50,563 --> 01:05:52,564
Push, Miss Tilly. Push.

932
01:05:52,899 --> 01:05:55,817
I am pushing,
you little star-fucker!

933
01:05:57,654 --> 01:06:00,155
Pay no attention
to little Miss Potty Mouth.

934
01:06:00,239 --> 01:06:01,823
She's hormonal.

935
01:06:05,828 --> 01:06:08,538
My God. It's coming.

936
01:06:08,623 --> 01:06:10,791
I can see its little head.

937
01:06:18,841 --> 01:06:20,258
What is it?
What is it?

938
01:06:22,428 --> 01:06:24,513
It's a boy.

939
01:06:24,597 --> 01:06:25,847
A boy.

940
01:06:25,973 --> 01:06:27,224
Oh, thank God.

941
01:06:27,809 --> 01:06:29,601
Give me my baby.

942
01:06:31,145 --> 01:06:32,896
I want my baby.

943
01:06:46,119 --> 01:06:49,871
Chucky, Chucky, uh,
well, we're not done here yet.

944
01:06:49,956 --> 01:06:50,997
What?

945
01:06:51,082 --> 01:06:52,249
Jennifer isn't done.

946
01:06:52,333 --> 01:06:54,459
We've got another one here!

947
01:06:54,919 --> 01:06:58,046
Push, Jennifer!
Push! Push, push.

948
01:06:58,131 --> 01:06:59,798
Push it out! Push!

949
01:07:03,970 --> 01:07:05,554
What's this one?

950
01:07:08,474 --> 01:07:10,016
It's a girl.

951
01:07:10,143 --> 01:07:11,727
Groovy.

952
01:07:13,479 --> 01:07:16,565
Ai, yai, yai, yai, yai.

953
01:07:23,406 --> 01:07:24,990
Chucky, it's time.

954
01:07:29,579 --> 01:07:32,539
Give me the power,
I beg of you.

955
01:07:32,623 --> 01:07:35,208
Chucky, first
he has to choose.

956
01:07:35,585 --> 01:07:37,669
I beg your pardon.

957
01:07:37,795 --> 01:07:40,088
I'm sorry.
She has to choose.

958
01:07:40,173 --> 01:07:41,673
We don't have time
for this shit!

959
01:07:41,758 --> 01:07:43,133
Wait, Chucky.

960
01:07:43,426 --> 01:07:45,594
We have a son
and a daughter.

961
01:07:46,012 --> 01:07:48,305
Glen and Glenda.

962
01:07:48,389 --> 01:07:49,890
Don't you get it?

963
01:07:49,974 --> 01:07:52,017
Maybe they don't
have to choose.

964
01:07:54,937 --> 01:07:56,521
Help!

965
01:07:56,606 --> 01:07:58,648
Hurry, Chucky!
Do the chant.

966
01:07:58,733 --> 01:07:59,816
Chucky, do it now!

967
01:07:59,901 --> 01:08:01,359
Help us!

968
01:08:01,444 --> 01:08:03,236
Chucky, what are you
standing there for?

969
01:08:03,321 --> 01:08:04,696
Do the chant!

970
01:08:08,618 --> 01:08:10,702
What are you waiting for?
Do it!

971
01:08:11,329 --> 01:08:12,537
Do the chant!

972
01:08:14,707 --> 01:08:15,707
Do it!

973
01:08:15,792 --> 01:08:18,794
Everybody just shut up!

974
01:08:20,004 --> 01:08:22,088
I have had it! That's it!

975
01:08:22,715 --> 01:08:25,383
There is a limit
to how much I can take.

976
01:08:25,551 --> 01:08:27,344
What are you
talking about?

977
01:08:27,428 --> 01:08:30,680
Look around you, Tiff.
This is nuts.

978
01:08:30,765 --> 01:08:34,184
And I have a very high
tolerance for nuts.

979
01:08:34,352 --> 01:08:36,561
If this is what it takes
to be human,

980
01:08:36,646 --> 01:08:38,605
then I would
rather take my chances

981
01:08:38,689 --> 01:08:40,607
as a supernaturally
possessed doll.

982
01:08:40,691 --> 01:08:42,317
It's less complicated.

983
01:08:42,401 --> 01:08:43,985
You can't be serious?

984
01:08:44,070 --> 01:08:45,862
As a heart attack.

985
01:08:45,947 --> 01:08:47,030
Think about it.

986
01:08:47,114 --> 01:08:49,991
What is so great
about being human, anyway?

987
01:08:50,076 --> 01:08:52,494
You get sick. You get old.

988
01:08:52,703 --> 01:08:54,830
You can't get it up anymore.

989
01:08:54,914 --> 01:08:56,832
I'm not lookin'
forward to that.

990
01:08:57,083 --> 01:09:01,002
But I want to be
Jennifer Tilly.

991
01:09:02,296 --> 01:09:04,172
I want to be a star.

992
01:09:04,298 --> 01:09:06,925
And I don't want to be
your chauffeur.

993
01:09:07,009 --> 01:09:09,928
As a doll,
I'm fucking infamous.

994
01:09:10,346 --> 01:09:13,932
I'm one of the most notorious
slashers in history.

995
01:09:14,016 --> 01:09:15,851
And I don't want
to give that up.

996
01:09:15,935 --> 01:09:19,229
I am Chucky, the killer doll!

997
01:09:19,355 --> 01:09:20,814
And I dig it!

998
01:09:24,569 --> 01:09:26,611
I have everything I want:

999
01:09:26,696 --> 01:09:28,446
a beautiful wife,

1000
01:09:30,950 --> 01:09:32,826
a multi-talented kid.

1001
01:09:33,119 --> 01:09:35,704
This is who I am, Tiff.

1002
01:09:36,289 --> 01:09:37,706
This is me.

1003
01:09:38,666 --> 01:09:40,417
Chucky, I don't know

1004
01:09:40,501 --> 01:09:42,878
what the fuck
you're talking about.

1005
01:09:42,962 --> 01:09:45,547
I don't know
who the fuck you are anymore.

1006
01:09:45,798 --> 01:09:48,300
But it's not enough for me.

1007
01:09:49,427 --> 01:09:50,802
I want more.

1008
01:09:51,804 --> 01:09:53,430
What are you sayin'?

1009
01:09:53,764 --> 01:09:55,181
It's over.

1010
01:09:56,517 --> 01:09:59,352
You've got to
get out of here, Sweetface.

1011
01:10:00,021 --> 01:10:03,148
I'm leaving you, Chucky,
and I'm taking the kid.

1012
01:10:03,649 --> 01:10:06,151
Nobody leaves me.

1013
01:10:06,777 --> 01:10:08,153
Nobody!

1014
01:10:09,447 --> 01:10:10,739
No!

1015
01:10:17,163 --> 01:10:18,288
Jennifer,

1016
01:10:20,041 --> 01:10:21,499
I love...

1017
01:10:21,584 --> 01:10:23,251
I love...

1018
01:10:23,753 --> 01:10:25,879
Stan, tell me. Tell me.

1019
01:10:26,422 --> 01:10:27,422
I love...

1020
01:10:27,506 --> 01:10:28,757
What?

1021
01:10:48,402 --> 01:10:49,569
Jesus.

1022
01:10:55,534 --> 01:10:56,910
Oh, my God.

1023
01:10:57,370 --> 01:11:00,705
My babies.
Give me my babies.

1024
01:11:10,299 --> 01:11:12,175
I just want to know
where they are.

1025
01:11:12,259 --> 01:11:13,301
They're fine, Jennifer.

1026
01:11:13,386 --> 01:11:14,636
They're in
the maternity ward.

1027
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:15,929
All right,
was that so hard?

1028
01:11:16,013 --> 01:11:18,515
The important thing to think
about now is getting well

1029
01:11:18,599 --> 01:11:20,850
so you can get on with
your life and your career.

1030
01:11:20,935 --> 01:11:22,060
I don't care
about my career.

1031
01:11:22,144 --> 01:11:23,186
I want my babies.

1032
01:11:23,270 --> 01:11:25,855
I'm working on it, Jennifer,
but you're not making it easy.

1033
01:11:25,940 --> 01:11:27,315
I already talked
to the cops.

1034
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:28,441
They cleared me.

1035
01:11:28,526 --> 01:11:29,985
They know
you're not a killer.

1036
01:11:30,069 --> 01:11:32,320
They didn't say
you were mentally competent.

1037
01:11:32,405 --> 01:11:35,198
Now what do you expect,
after the story you told them?

1038
01:11:35,282 --> 01:11:36,616
It's true.

1039
01:11:36,993 --> 01:11:40,787
Yeah, well, I suggest from now
on you keep that to yourself.

1040
01:11:41,414 --> 01:11:42,455
Hmm?

1041
01:11:43,749 --> 01:11:45,375
We'll talk later.

1042
01:11:49,171 --> 01:11:51,047
Try to get some sleep.

1043
01:12:59,575 --> 01:13:01,534
Wish me luck, Sweetface.

1044
01:13:01,619 --> 01:13:03,703
Mommy is going to be a star.

1045
01:13:20,387 --> 01:13:23,264
I can't think
of a thing to say.

1046
01:13:23,349 --> 01:13:24,682
Fuck it!

1047
01:13:28,687 --> 01:13:31,356
Give me the power,
I beg of you.

1048
01:13:41,033 --> 01:13:42,909
Switch! Switch!

1049
01:13:43,702 --> 01:13:45,745
Switch! Switch! Switch!

1050
01:13:50,292 --> 01:13:53,545
Nobody leaves me. Nobody.

1051
01:14:14,817 --> 01:14:16,317
Okasan.

1052
01:14:19,905 --> 01:14:23,700
I want you
to be a good girl

1053
01:14:24,577 --> 01:14:28,037
or boy. Whatever.

1054
01:14:30,332 --> 01:14:34,085
Don't make the same mistakes
your mom and dad made.

1055
01:14:36,922 --> 01:14:38,673
Especially your dad.

1056
01:15:26,263 --> 01:15:27,472
Let's go.

1057
01:15:43,405 --> 01:15:44,447
Glenda?

1058
01:15:44,531 --> 01:15:48,159
No, Dad! It's me!
Your boy!

1059
01:15:48,285 --> 01:15:50,787
Your chip
off the old block!

1060
01:15:53,666 --> 01:15:56,084
Are you proud
of me now, Daddy?

1061
01:15:56,168 --> 01:15:57,627
Are you?

1062
01:16:09,181 --> 01:16:13,142
Attaboy, kid. Attaboy.

1063
01:16:33,706 --> 01:16:35,164
There, there.

1064
01:16:36,583 --> 01:16:37,917
There, there.

1065
01:16:39,169 --> 01:16:40,712
It's all right.

1066
01:16:41,839 --> 01:16:43,339
It's all right.

1067
01:16:44,383 --> 01:16:46,426
It's going to be
all right.

1068
01:16:48,387 --> 01:16:49,762
There, there.

1069
01:16:54,810 --> 01:16:56,394
It's all right.

1070
01:17:18,083 --> 01:17:21,002
Yesterday, she gave Dana
Shelton a bloody nose

1071
01:17:21,086 --> 01:17:23,338
and took pictures of it
for Show and Tell.

1072
01:17:23,422 --> 01:17:25,381
She called
the cat the "C" word.

1073
01:17:25,466 --> 01:17:28,343
And I'm pretty sure she's been
taking money from my purse.

1074
01:17:28,427 --> 01:17:29,552
That's ridiculous.

1075
01:17:29,636 --> 01:17:31,012
Glen, he is an angel.

1076
01:17:31,096 --> 01:17:32,388
An absolute dream.

1077
01:17:32,598 --> 01:17:34,098
But Glenda,

1078
01:17:34,391 --> 01:17:36,517
she's a bad girl,
Miss Tilly.

1079
01:17:36,977 --> 01:17:38,394
A very bad girl.

1080
01:17:38,479 --> 01:17:40,521
I'm not listening to this.

1081
01:17:42,483 --> 01:17:43,816
Oh, I hate that thing.

1082
01:17:43,901 --> 01:17:45,610
Some of the kids
really want to see her.

1083
01:17:45,694 --> 01:17:46,694
Miss Tilly.

1084
01:17:46,779 --> 01:17:47,779
What?

1085
01:17:47,863 --> 01:17:49,113
I'm afraid of her.

1086
01:17:49,198 --> 01:17:52,408
Oh, Fulvia,
it's only a doll.

1087
01:17:54,661 --> 01:17:56,788
I was talking about Glenda.

1088
01:17:58,916 --> 01:18:00,124
Fulvia,

1089
01:18:00,793 --> 01:18:03,544
just exactly
what are you trying to say?

1090
01:18:04,546 --> 01:18:06,339
I can't work here
anymore.

1091
01:18:06,423 --> 01:18:07,507
What?

1092
01:18:07,591 --> 01:18:08,716
I'm sorry,
I just can't.

1093
01:18:08,801 --> 01:18:11,219
If you only saw the way
she looks at me,

1094
01:18:11,303 --> 01:18:13,554
with such hate.

1095
01:18:16,392 --> 01:18:19,644
All right, Fulvia,
if that's what you want.

1096
01:18:21,271 --> 01:18:22,814
We'll miss you.

1097
01:18:23,065 --> 01:18:26,526
Thank you, Miss Tilly.
God bless.

1098
01:18:27,277 --> 01:18:28,319
Hmm.

1099
01:19:01,985 --> 01:19:03,652
Mom got her wish.

1100
01:19:03,736 --> 01:19:05,904
She's a bright shining star.

1101
01:19:06,698 --> 01:19:08,866
Now we're the perfect family.

1102
01:19:09,826 --> 01:19:12,119
I've learned
a lot about myself.

1103
01:19:12,203 --> 01:19:13,829
I know I'm not alone.

1104
01:19:13,955 --> 01:19:15,622
I know I'm not a freak.

1105
01:19:16,249 --> 01:19:18,834
And even though
we had our differences,

1106
01:19:18,918 --> 01:19:21,545
I know my dad
really loved me.

1107
01:19:22,922 --> 01:19:23,964
Oh, Glen.

1108
01:19:24,048 --> 01:19:26,425
Glen, sweetheart,
come over here.

1109
01:19:28,428 --> 01:19:29,761
Here, sweetheart,
look.

1110
01:19:29,846 --> 01:19:31,180
Here's another one.

1111
01:19:31,639 --> 01:19:32,931
Who is it from, Mommy?

1112
01:19:33,016 --> 01:19:34,266
I don't know.

1113
01:19:34,934 --> 01:19:38,478
Hmm, let's see.
Oh, it doesn't say.

1114
01:19:38,938 --> 01:19:41,190
Strange.
It doesn't say who it is.

1115
01:19:41,274 --> 01:19:43,108
Bye, sweetheart.
Don't run so fast.

1116
01:19:43,193 --> 01:19:44,318
You're going to trip.

1117
01:19:44,402 --> 01:19:49,239
So anyway, he determined
that he was going to go off...

1118
01:20:36,454 --> 01:20:40,290
One way or another,
I'm gonna find ya

1119
01:20:40,375 --> 01:20:42,584
I'm gonna get ya, get ya,
get ya, get ya

1120
01:20:42,669 --> 01:20:46,255
One way or another,
I'm gonna win ya

1121
01:20:46,339 --> 01:20:48,548
I'm gonna get ya, get ya,
get ya, get ya

1122
01:20:48,633 --> 01:20:52,261
One way or another
I'm gonna see ya

1123
01:20:52,345 --> 01:20:54,846
I'm gonna meet ya,
meet ya, meet ya, meet ya

1124
01:20:54,931 --> 01:20:58,225
One day maybe next week,
I'm gonna meet ya

1125
01:20:58,309 --> 01:21:00,602
I'm gonna meet ya,
I'll meet ya

1126
01:21:00,687 --> 01:21:05,565
I will drive past
your house

1127
01:21:07,860 --> 01:21:12,030
And if the lights
are all down

1128
01:21:12,115 --> 01:21:16,410
I'll see who's around

1129
01:21:18,454 --> 01:21:22,207
One way or another,
I'm gonna find ya

1130
01:21:22,292 --> 01:21:24,543
I'm gonna get ya, get ya,
get ya, get ya

1131
01:21:24,627 --> 01:21:28,213
One way or another,
I'm gonna win ya

1132
01:21:28,298 --> 01:21:30,465
I'm gonna get ya, get ya,
get ya, get ya

1133
01:21:31,092 --> 01:21:35,512
And if the lights
are all down

1134
01:21:35,930 --> 01:21:39,141
I'll see who's around

1135
01:21:57,827 --> 01:22:01,163
One way or another,
I'm gonna lose ya

1136
01:22:01,247 --> 01:22:03,290
I'm gonna give you
the slip

1137
01:22:03,374 --> 01:22:07,210
I'll slip out of here for
another I'm gonna lose ya

1138
01:22:07,295 --> 01:22:09,338
I'm gonna trick ya,
I'll trick ya

1139
01:22:09,422 --> 01:22:13,216
One way or another,
I'm gonna lose ya

1140
01:22:13,301 --> 01:22:15,677
I'm gonna trick ya, trick
ya, trick ya, trick ya

1141
01:22:15,762 --> 01:22:19,056
One way or another,
I'm gonna lose ya

1142
01:22:19,432 --> 01:22:21,683
I'm gonna give you
the slip

1143
01:22:27,565 --> 01:22:30,317
I'll walk down the mall,
stand over by the wall

1144
01:22:30,401 --> 01:22:33,320
Where I can see it all,
find out who you call

1145
01:22:33,404 --> 01:22:35,989
Lead you
to the supermarket checkout

1146
01:22:36,074 --> 01:22:38,033
Some specials and rat food

1147
01:22:38,117 --> 01:22:39,910
Get lost in the crowd

1148
01:22:39,994 --> 01:22:42,454
One way or another

1149
01:22:42,538 --> 01:22:45,123
Where I can see it all,
find out who ya call

1150
01:22:45,208 --> 01:22:48,210
One way or another

1151
01:22:48,294 --> 01:22:51,671
Some specials and rat food
get lost in the crowd

1152
01:22:51,756 --> 01:22:54,341
One way or another

1153
01:22:54,467 --> 01:22:57,803
Where I can see it all,
find out who you call

1154
01:23:00,181 --> 01:23:03,558
Some specials and rat food
get lost in the crowd

1155
01:23:03,976 --> 01:23:06,436
I just love
this movie. Don't you?

1156
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:36,425
Let's hit the street tonight
we got a brand new ride

1157
01:23:36,509 --> 01:23:38,844
We got a beat that's tight
me and my boy inside

1158
01:23:38,928 --> 01:23:40,762
Let's ride
till the wheels fall off

1159
01:23:40,847 --> 01:23:42,347
All the ladies
scream and shout

1160
01:23:42,432 --> 01:23:43,807
All the fellas ball

1161
01:23:43,891 --> 01:23:45,684
'Cause we're going
to the club tonight

1162
01:23:45,768 --> 01:23:48,103
Man, I'm buyin' up the bar
once I get inside

1163
01:23:48,688 --> 01:23:49,980
East coast west coast

1164
01:23:50,064 --> 01:23:51,773
Show love from
the north to the south

1165
01:23:51,858 --> 01:23:54,401
Everybody,
cut it up, cut it up

1166
01:23:54,902 --> 01:23:56,611
Cut it up, cut it up

1167
01:23:56,696 --> 01:23:59,030
Cut it up, cut it up

1168
01:23:59,699 --> 01:24:01,491
Cut it up, cut it up

1169
01:24:01,576 --> 01:24:02,868
Cut it up, yeah

1170
01:24:02,952 --> 01:24:06,413
Cut it up, cut it up,
cut it up

1171
01:24:06,539 --> 01:24:08,874
Cut it up, cut it up

1172
01:24:09,459 --> 01:24:11,293
Cut it up, cut it up

1173
01:24:11,377 --> 01:24:12,627
Cut 'em up

1174
01:24:12,712 --> 01:24:15,380
Ooh, look at
the big-time stunner

1175
01:24:15,465 --> 01:24:17,799
Cruising down Mulholland
in the new Hummer

1176
01:24:17,884 --> 01:24:20,093
You know it was stolen
you know I stay rollin'

1177
01:24:20,178 --> 01:24:22,804
Me and my boy-boy
we ride like soldiers

1178
01:24:22,889 --> 01:24:24,890
Big Chucky
ooh, I'm so lucky

1179
01:24:24,974 --> 01:24:27,392
I'm a murdering psychopath
that's why they can't touch me

1180
01:24:27,935 --> 01:24:30,896
I'm iller than M.J.'s Thriller
see the scar on my face

1181
01:24:30,980 --> 01:24:33,398
Like Pacino I'm a killer

1182
01:24:33,524 --> 01:24:35,817
Cut it up, cut it up

1183
01:24:35,902 --> 01:24:38,278
Cut it up, cut it up

1184
01:24:38,362 --> 01:24:40,572
Cut it up, cut it up

1185
01:24:40,740 --> 01:24:43,283
Cut it up, yeah,
cut it up

1186
01:24:43,868 --> 01:24:45,660
Cut it up, cut it up

1187
01:24:45,745 --> 01:24:48,121
Cut it up, cut it up

1188
01:24:48,664 --> 01:24:50,499
Cut it up, cut it up

1189
01:24:50,583 --> 01:24:52,083
Cut 'em up

1190
01:24:52,251 --> 01:24:55,337
Whoever thought that I was
a joke I slit their throat

1191
01:24:55,421 --> 01:24:57,255
Then drink a rum and coke

1192
01:24:57,340 --> 01:25:00,342
I get movies and I'm iller
than ever tougher than leather

1193
01:25:00,426 --> 01:25:01,676
And way more clever

1194
01:25:01,761 --> 01:25:04,721
Everybody in the club
feelin' this, Big Chucky

1195
01:25:04,847 --> 01:25:07,057
with his son and
of course his missus

1196
01:25:07,141 --> 01:25:10,519
So beware if you've got a flat
tire, I swear Jason, Freddy Kreuger

1197
01:25:10,603 --> 01:25:12,729
and even Michael Myer
cut it up

1198
01:25:13,272 --> 01:25:14,981
Cut it up, cut it up

1199
01:25:15,107 --> 01:25:17,359
Cut it up, cut it up

1200
01:25:17,443 --> 01:25:19,778
Cut it up, cut it up

1201
01:25:19,862 --> 01:25:21,112
Cut it up, yeah

1202
01:25:21,239 --> 01:25:24,699
Cut it up, cut it up,
cut it up

1203
01:25:24,784 --> 01:25:27,410
Cut it up, cut it up

1204
01:25:27,954 --> 01:25:29,663
Cut it up, cut it up

1205
01:25:29,747 --> 01:25:31,081
Cut 'em up

1206
01:25:55,565 --> 01:25:58,316
I can't think of a thing to say.

1207
01:25:58,693 --> 01:25:59,693
Fuck it!

1208
01:26:07,451 --> 01:26:08,660
Oh, God!

1209
01:26:09,305 --> 01:27:09,353
