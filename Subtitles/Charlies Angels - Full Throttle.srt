1
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:43,603
Get off the babysitter.
Daddy's home.

2
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:24,602
What is an Angel doing so far from Heaven?

3
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,237
I'm no Angel.

4
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:06,269
This is hostel, yeah?

5
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,982
I'm good at the bull, no?

6
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:47,912
Marshal Ray Carter? I'm Alex Munday.
I'll be your rescuer today.

7
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,248
I didn't think you'd find me.
How many men do you have?

8
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,542
I've got two girlfriends in the bar.

9
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,336
They have 50 armed men.

10
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:58,798
I know. It hardly seems fair.
Come on.

11
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:04,345
- What is it?
- My ribs.

12
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:06,889
Dylan? Dylan,
we need to get out of here.

13
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:08,557
I'm on top of it.

14
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:23,447
- They got my ring.
- I'm sure your wife will understand.

15
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:38,921
Kill them!

16
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,090
Kill them all!

17
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:26,802
Plan B.

18
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:53,162
Just once, I'd like to walk out of a bar.

19
00:07:12,808 --> 00:07:14,266
Let's go!

20
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:32,326
Now!

21
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,518
- Get in!
- You got him?

22
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:06,026
Dylan!

23
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:09,238
Go for it!

24
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:11,407
- Dylan!
- I'm trying!

25
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:24,044
I'm afraid I underestimated you guys.

26
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:25,421
Yeah.

27
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:27,923
That happens a lot.

28
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:53,782
It was three girls!

29
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,701
Three crazy beautiful girls.

30
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:56,952
But we have the ring.

31
00:08:57,621 --> 00:08:59,997
I always knew this day would come...

32
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:02,875
Let's go to plan B.

33
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:10,257
Once upon a time, there were three
very different little girls.

34
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:29,777
Come on, Alex. This is the last pass.
You can do it!

35
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,406
Harder! Harder! Harder!

36
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:55,177
I want you! I want you now!

37
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:59,348
Who grew up to be three very different women.

38
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,392
No.

39
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:25,749
Okay.

40
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:36,051
You, hot water.

41
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:39,221
Here it goes. Here it goes.

42
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:43,434
There we go.

43
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:48,147
Now they work for me.
My name is Charlie.

44
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,593
Perimeter secure.
We're ready for takeoff.

45
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:02,262
Well done, Agent McDowell.

46
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:01,298
Hey, check this out.

47
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,426
Our first piece of mail.

48
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:15,729
- Your 10-year high-school reunion.
- It'll be a fun night, Nat.

49
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:18,273
- Isn't that cool?
- It's great.

50
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:23,111
I still can't believe Nat and Pete
are moving in together.

51
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,865
- Our little Angel's growing up.
- It's wild that Natalie owns property.

52
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,368
The most expensive thing I own are these boots.

53
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:32,788
- Excuse me. Those are my boots.
- Whatever. My point is--

54
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,919
I forgot my point.

55
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:41,296
You're broke, horny and wearing my boots.

56
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:43,382
Thank you.

57
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:51,306
So you thought you could escape my fortress.

58
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:53,100
Not so fast.

59
00:14:57,105 --> 00:15:00,732
- Oh, my God! Jason.
- Surprise.

60
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,986
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

61
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,821
That was fun.

62
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:07,823
Fun. Yeah.

63
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:13,453
- What are you doing here?
- I miss you. Look--

64
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:20,002
What are you doing later, after this?
Later on?

65
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:25,132
Jason, I thought we were
on a time-out.

66
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,343
What? We can't fool around at all?

67
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:31,847
Hey, Jason.
I didn't think you'd make it.

68
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:36,101
Yeah, the photo shoot ran late. Plus,
I wanted to miss all the heavy stuff.

69
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,186
- Hey, Jason.
- Hey.

70
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,314
- How's the sequel going?
- Great.

71
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:43,692
We had, like, 13 writers,
so it should be pretty good.

72
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,737
- I loved the first one.
- Yeah, it was great.

73
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:52,951
Sorry. We got a great title for this
one: Maximum Extreme-2.

74
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:57,998
The premiere's Friday, so I brought you tickets.

75
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,542
I love tickets!

76
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,547
- Hello?
- Yeah?

77
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:07,674
- Be right in.
- Thanks.

78
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:09,384
Sorry.

79
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:13,055
- Thanks for helping out, Jason.
- Yeah, yeah.

80
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:15,223
Charlie.

81
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:19,811
Bosley!

82
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,689
What's happening, Angels?
How y'all doing?

83
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:24,066
- Hey.
- Hey, Bos.

84
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:27,736
Look here. I see my brother
ain't checked the books in a while.

85
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:29,071
We have a book?

86
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:33,325
Look here, lovelies, I only been here
a few days, but will you explain...

87
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:34,951
...what the hell is this?

88
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,203
Now, what--?

89
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:40,707
Careful with that, Bos.

90
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:42,876
I'm all right.

91
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:47,547
And I also see y'all being played.
Five G's for a Kevlar vest?

92
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:50,550
- We need those.
- They're made especially for us.

93
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:53,762
What? You all fine, but you crazy.

94
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:58,350
What?

95
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:00,102
Bosley, come here.

96
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:02,104
- Have a seat, Bos.
- Okay.

97
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,563
- Bos.
- What?

98
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,190
B.

99
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,652
Your brother didn't sweat the details.

100
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,113
- We do what it takes.
- Right.

101
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,281
So, what does a Bosley do around here?

102
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:17,452
- He does the most important job of all.
- What's that?

103
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:20,455
He connects us with Charlie.

104
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:25,669
Okay. All right. All right.

105
00:17:25,837 --> 00:17:28,547
- Good morning, Angels.
- Good morning, Charlie.

106
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:31,967
Bosley, I hope the Angels
aren't being too rough on you.

107
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:36,096
Man, please. I date fat women.
What are you talking about?

108
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:39,224
Great work in Mongolia, Angels...

109
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:42,894
...but I'm afraid the case
has taken a new turn.

110
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,439
Goddamn! What the f--?
Look-- Look--

111
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,153
I know where I'm watching
the game at tonight. Look at that.

112
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:55,532
Angels, I'd like to introduce Roger
Wixon, senior director of the FBI.

113
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,325
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Pleasure.

114
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:58,827
- Hi.
- Hello.

115
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:01,037
Over the years, the Townsend Agency...

116
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,373
...has worked on projects
for the bureau...

117
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:07,419
...but never one with so many
innocent lives at stake.

118
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:11,173
Hey, I'm busy watching that doggone screen.

119
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,966
Good job, Bos.

120
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:17,971
Angels, you're aware of the Federal
Witness Protection Program.

121
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:20,390
People who testify
against major crime figures...

122
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:22,809
...are relocated
and given new identities.

123
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:27,355
The identities of these witnesses are
protected by a program called HALO:

124
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,733
Hidden Alias List Operation.

125
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:33,195
The list is encrypted on two titanium rings.

126
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:36,448
The data on each ring is
indecipherable on its own...

127
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:40,702
...but when they are read together,
their codes unlock each other.

128
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,162
Who wears the rings?

129
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,998
The head of the U.S. Marshal Service
was wearing one.

130
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:47,083
- Ray Carter.
- Good morning.

131
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:51,046
- Hey, how are you feeling?
- Couple of fractured ribs, but I'll live.

132
00:18:51,214 --> 00:18:52,547
Who wears the other ring?

133
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:56,343
The head of security for the Justice
Department, William Rose Bailey.

134
00:18:56,511 --> 00:18:58,887
Unfortunately, he was killed this morning.

135
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:02,140
- Now both rings are in the open.
- So the list is out.

136
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:04,392
Someone's contacted the major
crime families offering to sell the list.

137
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,023
One of our protected witness, Alan Caufield...

138
00:19:10,233 --> 00:19:12,067
...was found dead at home
in the Valley.

139
00:19:12,235 --> 00:19:17,531
Angels, we need to get the HALO
rings back before the list is sold.

140
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:21,076
- We'll start at the Caufield house.
- See if that leads us to HALO.

141
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:25,580
Hey, Charlie, we could really use
Bosley's help on this one.

142
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:28,250
- Get to drive the racecar?
- Not today.

143
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,377
- Blow up a castle?
- Not yet, Bos.

144
00:19:30,545 --> 00:19:32,629
Well, what do y'all need me to do?

145
00:19:33,548 --> 00:19:37,259
- Read some body language.
- Hell, yeah.

146
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:07,873
I'm not going nowhere near no dead body.

147
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:15,964
Freeze, ladies. If you're not a dead
body, other side of the ropes.

148
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:19,259
We got a serious situation here.
My men have the area secure.

149
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:21,636
I have to ask you to evacuate immediately.

150
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:27,559
We got a 211, a 183, believe it or not,
we got an 11-350, and it ain't pretty.

151
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:31,897
An 11-350? You found an illegal
chinchilla ranch on the premises?

152
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,524
It's a chinchilla farm.

153
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:36,443
But you're good.

154
00:20:36,611 --> 00:20:38,820
Negatory to orders to relinquish locality.

155
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:40,989
Circumspect to your observation...

156
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:45,160
...we'll proceed to the interior of the
dwelling with your accompaniment.

157
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:50,290
Well, I do not copy. Repeat, do not
copy. I'll have to ask my sergeant.

158
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,834
Your sergeant is here.

159
00:21:11,354 --> 00:21:12,938
Hands off.

160
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:17,359
If you had your game faces on at the
academy, you ought to figure this out.

161
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:21,404
Simple café coronary.
Freak show choked to death.

162
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:23,156
Questions?

163
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:27,535
Examination of soft palate reveals
porcine byproduct...

164
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,371
...lodged in vestibule.

165
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:33,041
Okay, let's do this. Come on, baby.

166
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:36,252
Caufield shows no signs of trauma to the larynx.

167
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:39,047
His struggle pattern indicates
that he didn't choke.

168
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:42,550
He was smothered.

169
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:45,220
Ladies, we got some carnauba residue.

170
00:21:45,388 --> 00:21:47,180
Pineapple.

171
00:21:47,348 --> 00:21:50,475
Oh, it's Sex Wax. Best for your stick.

172
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:51,893
Pardon me?

173
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:54,145
- The killer's a surfer.
- How do you know?

174
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:57,440
He used the credit card he uses
to scrape wax off his board...

175
00:21:58,401 --> 00:22:00,193
...to gain entry into the house.

176
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:02,654
Thrasher scumbag surfers.

177
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:04,739
Freeze!

178
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:10,286
I found a foreign print. He was wearing
reissued 1989 Air Jordans.

179
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:12,330
A limited promotional version sold...

180
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:15,750
...only at the Foot Locker
in Fontana, in the summer of 2002.

181
00:22:16,711 --> 00:22:19,087
There's a discrepancy in weight distribution...

182
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:22,090
...between the left and right sides.

183
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:26,928
An anterior cruciate ligament
that was repaired in the last year.

184
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:29,431
All right, who did it?

185
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:31,766
A killer with a scar on his knee who surfs.

186
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:32,976
Did he stink?

187
00:22:33,144 --> 00:22:36,771
There's a hurricane off Baja. That
means good swells for south beaches.

188
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:38,231
Was there a lot of blood?

189
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:41,359
Offshore winds, Third Point.
Malibu's pumping.

190
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:45,530
- Alex, surfboards are at your house.
- Share it with me, Angels.

191
00:22:46,574 --> 00:22:47,782
Freeze!

192
00:22:51,454 --> 00:22:53,997
Daddy? Daddy!

193
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:58,293
Darling! I was meeting your mother
in Bali, and they canceled the flight.

194
00:22:58,461 --> 00:23:03,131
Some sort of monsoon.
So how is my favorite little ferret?

195
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,633
Do the face.

196
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:09,387
No, come on. Do it properly.

197
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:17,479
That is so cute.
I do the whiskers with my dad.

198
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:22,484
Mr. Munday, it is such a pleasure
to finally meet you.

199
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,152
I'm Dylan.

200
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,487
That's Natalie.

201
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:28,114
I assure you, none of the stories are true.

202
00:23:28,282 --> 00:23:30,658
Well, some of them are.

203
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:34,412
So you work with Alex at the hospital?

204
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:41,377
Yes! Natalie works
in the psychiatric ward...

205
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:44,631
...and Dylan is the head
of gynecology.

206
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:46,966
Really?

207
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:48,927
- So young.
- I know.

208
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:54,182
We were just on our way out. We have
a major procedure coming up, so....

209
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:58,561
- Duty calls. Sorry.
- I've got to prep.

210
00:23:58,729 --> 00:23:59,771
Scrub up.

211
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:01,314
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

212
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:02,732
See you in a minute.

213
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,401
It's just a tiny emergency.
Make yourself at home.

214
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:07,529
We'll talk later.
Go save lives.

215
00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:09,531
Love you.

216
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:15,161
Head of gynecology?

217
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:28,424
Wait a second.

218
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,345
Bos? There's a waxer on your 6.

219
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:33,555
Is that you, Lord?

220
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:36,391
Get in there and see
if he uses pineapple Sex Wax.

221
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,434
Dylan, check it out.

222
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,147
I got sand in my ass.
I can't hardly walk.

223
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:45,233
Just blend in. Be cool, Bos.

224
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:55,160
Got any wax?

225
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:56,786
Great job, Bos.

226
00:24:58,164 --> 00:25:01,749
Is that grape? It's grape.

227
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:03,459
It's grape!

228
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:04,752
Yes, sir!

229
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,505
Suspect four eliminated.

230
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:12,302
What's up, Angel?

231
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:18,892
- Madison Lee?
- Natalie Cook?

232
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:20,310
Oh, my God.

233
00:25:22,897 --> 00:25:24,189
How did you know?

234
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:27,108
- I get the newsletter.
- Of course.

235
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:31,779
Wow. I've heard so many stories
about you. You're my favorite Angel.

236
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:35,325
She won the Nobel Prize for her
research on flying mammals.

237
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:37,702
And predicted Carmine DeSoto's every move...

238
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:40,163
...by using the Cosmo
Bedside Astrologer.

239
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:47,128
I also set the clock on Charlie's VCR.

240
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:50,256
And she invented the molar mike.

241
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:53,134
- Dylan and Alex?
- Yeah.

242
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:59,307
- God, how I miss stakeouts.
- I know. Aren't they the best?

243
00:25:59,934 --> 00:26:02,352
Bring it on Bitch!

244
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:06,397
Only one waxer left.

245
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:07,690
Wait a second.

246
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:10,735
Subpatellar scar, left knee.

247
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:15,156
Check it out. Brown shorts, red board,
11 o'clock. What do you think?

248
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:19,077
- Yummy.
- That's what I thought.

249
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:22,080
Case closed. Nat, move in.
Dylan thinks he's hot.

250
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:23,331
What do you mean?

251
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:26,125
You always fall for the bad guy.

252
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:29,671
Then this guy must be really evil.

253
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:32,590
You should see the new agency.
It's beautiful.

254
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:36,594
Maybe I will. Tell Charlie hello
for me when you see him.

255
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:39,847
You know.

256
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:07,709
There she goes.

257
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:11,254
Who do you think will be
the first of us to leave?

258
00:27:11,422 --> 00:27:13,298
You, me or Natalie?

259
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:16,384
- What are you talking about?
- I think it'll be Nat.

260
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:18,219
Why? Did she say something?

261
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:21,389
Nat and Pete live together now.
Soon they'll be engaged...

262
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:23,725
...and you and I will wear
pink dresses...

263
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:27,228
...at the wedding
of Mr. and Mrs. Pete Kominsky.

264
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:32,358
Yeah, but even if she got married,
she'd never leave us.

265
00:27:32,526 --> 00:27:36,529
Sooner or later, you and I are gonna
have to break in a new Angel.

266
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:40,533
Good morning, Angels.

267
00:27:40,701 --> 00:27:43,161
Good morning, Charlie.

268
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:48,249
- Good morning, Angels.
- Good morning, Charlie.

269
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,212
Good morning, Angels.

270
00:27:53,380 --> 00:28:00,303
Good morning, Charlie.

271
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:08,061
I mean, you didn't think it would be
the three of us forever, did you?

272
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:11,564
I think I lost my nuts.
Your nuts ever get small?

273
00:28:11,732 --> 00:28:16,110
When I get in water, they just shrink
up. They become like one marble.

274
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:31,292
Killer, huh?

275
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:33,294
I just got so excited.

276
00:28:33,462 --> 00:28:36,297
When it's big like that,
I love to ride it hard and rough.

277
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:39,050
Sorry.

278
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:43,429
The way I was getting pounded,
I'm gonna be wet for hours.

279
00:28:57,027 --> 00:28:58,986
Catch you later.

280
00:29:00,948 --> 00:29:03,032
Randy Emmers.

281
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,871
- Pineapple Sex Wax.
- "The Coal Bowl."

282
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:12,542
Hey, check it out.
"Leo," that could be his next target.

283
00:29:22,678 --> 00:29:24,345
This is it.

284
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:26,347
The Coal Bowl.

285
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:28,766
Let's get dirty.

286
00:29:40,446 --> 00:29:43,030
- I'll buy in.
- I'll find Leo.

287
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:45,658
I'll look for Emmers.

288
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:47,952
- I'll look for Emmers.
- Yeah.

289
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:54,167
All right, Leo, you're mine.

290
00:29:55,002 --> 00:29:56,961
Good luck.

291
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:59,630
- You in charge here?
- You know it.

292
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:03,593
- I want in.
- It's a two-G buy-in. Winner takes all.

293
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,138
- Rules are, there are no rules.
- I'm down.

294
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:10,391
Three out of four don't cross the finish line.

295
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:13,060
I'll take those odds.

296
00:30:17,191 --> 00:30:19,108
Hey, how's it going?

297
00:30:19,276 --> 00:30:22,528
- Metzger's at the far double.
- Is this your first time--?

298
00:30:22,696 --> 00:30:24,864
Carmichael's at the finish line.

299
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:27,200
I was thinking may--

300
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,598
You and Pete moving in together is a big deal.

301
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:54,560
- Yeah, it's great, isn't it?
- So where do you see this going?

302
00:30:54,728 --> 00:30:57,271
Going? I'm confused.

303
00:30:57,439 --> 00:31:00,358
Okay, say someone was to come up to me and say:

304
00:31:00,526 --> 00:31:04,028
"Hey, Dylan, do you think
Natalie wants to get married?"

305
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:09,534
What? Did Pete ask you to ask me
if I wanted to get married?

306
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,953
- No.
- Because we just moved in together.

307
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,247
Heads up, I've spotted Emmers.
I'm on him.

308
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,624
Red bike, red helmet.

309
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,648
Nat, number 25. Check it out.

310
00:31:41,275 --> 00:31:43,359
The lion. That's Leo.

311
00:31:44,695 --> 00:31:46,487
I got it. The guy in blue.

312
00:31:59,293 --> 00:32:01,085
I got shut out.

313
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:09,677
- What was that?
- He's after Leo.

314
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:21,689
He just took out a guy in the front double.

315
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,322
- He's making his way up to Leo.
- I'm gonna get him.

316
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:41,709
That's it! Let's get in there.

317
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:03,189
I got him, I got him!

318
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:10,196
- He's gonna crush him!
- Look out, Nat!

319
00:33:11,657 --> 00:33:13,908
What the hell are you doing?!

320
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,537
Nat, he's on your 6.

321
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:25,670
No, Natalie!

322
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:30,549
- Natalie!
- I'm okay.

323
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,763
We gotta take him out!

324
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:44,772
I'll get back in.

325
00:33:56,618 --> 00:33:58,202
Let's go!

326
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:59,620
Get him at the double.

327
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:44,331
- You okay?
- Yeah.

328
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:50,463
Hey, what are you doing with my bike?

329
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:22,828
Dylan!

330
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:50,189
The Thin Man.

331
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:01,951
He's dead.

332
00:36:03,245 --> 00:36:06,413
- What the hell is going on?
- Hey, you're just a kid.

333
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:08,374
I'm 15 and a half.

334
00:36:08,542 --> 00:36:11,001
Photos. Alan Caufield.

335
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:14,797
- Max Petroni.
- How'd you know my real name?

336
00:36:16,383 --> 00:36:17,550
What the hell's this?

337
00:36:17,843 --> 00:36:20,845
Hey, this is a picture of Dylan.

338
00:36:21,054 --> 00:36:23,973
The name on the back is Helen Zaas.

339
00:36:28,854 --> 00:36:30,938
Helen Zaas.

340
00:36:32,274 --> 00:36:33,941
My name before I went into...

341
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:36,610
...the Witness Protection Program
8 years ago.

342
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:38,904
And then I became Dylan Sanders.

343
00:36:39,072 --> 00:36:41,615
When the FBI realized
the young lady's potential...

344
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:43,450
...they gave me a call.

345
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:46,453
- Okay, wait. Helen Zaas?
- Yeah.

346
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:47,997
- That's your name?
- Yeah.

347
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:49,957
Helen Zaas.

348
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:56,130
So where does that name come
from originally? Is that Ass-tralian?

349
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,966
Yeah.

350
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:02,136
Oh, my God, you must have been
the butt of every joke.

351
00:37:02,304 --> 00:37:06,432
- Did you drive an Aston Martin?
- Alex, we're being asinine.

352
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,142
Yes, you are.

353
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:11,478
Don't worry, Dylan. We're still
gonna be your best butties.

354
00:37:12,314 --> 00:37:17,151
Now, Angels, a rose by any
other name still smells as sweet.

355
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:19,570
Thank you, Charlie.
It's not that funny.

356
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:20,863
Yeah, it is.

357
00:37:21,031 --> 00:37:23,824
- Bos, can I get a ruling on this one?
- You sure can.

358
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:28,329
You know what? Personally,
I'm not interested in Helen Zaas.

359
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:30,247
I'm more concerned about yours.

360
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:33,500
No matter what, you're still gonna be our Dylan.

361
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:35,502
- Thank you, Bos.
- You're welcome.

362
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:39,048
Let me guess, you fell for the bad guy.

363
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:41,759
I fell for the worst guy.

364
00:37:41,927 --> 00:37:44,178
But he was so cute, and I liked him so much.

365
00:37:44,346 --> 00:37:45,930
We had so much fun together...

366
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,974
...just driving around,
listening to metal and....

367
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:04,031
And then one night, things got really bad.

368
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:14,541
I love you!
I would die for you, Seamus!

369
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,127
O'Grady.

370
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:20,172
You got some balls.

371
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:32,518
He said he'd kill me if I told anyone,
but I had to put him away.

372
00:38:32,686 --> 00:38:35,813
- Of course you did.
- You did the right thing.

373
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:39,024
- He was my first.
- Really?

374
00:38:39,192 --> 00:38:43,070
- But you told me you never did it.
- My first bust.

375
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:45,739
- Yeah.
- Who was this guy?

376
00:38:47,492 --> 00:38:51,453
- Seamus O'Grady.
- O'Grady?

377
00:38:51,621 --> 00:38:54,873
- As in the Irish mob?
- I sent him to prison.

378
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:09,513
O'Grady.

379
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:12,599
You're out.

380
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:21,817
O'Grady, what about your belongings?

381
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:37,958
So if I have these, she'll find me?

382
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:45,049
- The O'Gradys killed my parents.
- What?

383
00:39:45,759 --> 00:39:47,259
Sorry, Max.

384
00:39:47,844 --> 00:39:49,887
I testified against them.

385
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:55,267
Wait a second. Alan Caufield.
He testified against the O'Gradys.

386
00:39:55,435 --> 00:39:58,645
That's it. The O'Gradys must have
HALO. This is our one lead.

387
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,898
The Thin Man.

388
00:40:01,066 --> 00:40:03,817
- Our favorite assassin.
- That's right.

389
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:07,654
- This needs to go get analyzed.
- Yes, let's get up in there and do that.

390
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:09,448
Let me see it.

391
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:14,703
Yeah, I know exactly what this is.
I have one.

392
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:16,747
The nuns gave it to us at the orphanage.

393
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:18,749
Orphanage.

394
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:22,669
- Good work.
- Max is in our protective custody now.

395
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:27,800
- It's up to us to keep him safe.
- Hey, I know the safest place in town.

396
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:45,109
Listen, don't you worry about a thing.

397
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:48,362
No O'Grady ever set foot
in South Central. Can you dig it?

398
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:50,030
- Yeah.
- This is my mama house.

399
00:40:50,198 --> 00:40:52,991
Rule number one: Don't look
her in the eye. Understand?

400
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,868
Or she'll pop. Can you dig it?

401
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:57,037
- Bosley.
- Yes, ma'am?

402
00:40:57,205 --> 00:40:58,747
You get over here.

403
00:40:58,915 --> 00:41:00,124
Hey, Mama.

404
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:03,794
- What kind of trouble you in now?
- I'm not in any trou-- Yes, ma'am.

405
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:05,212
- Come on.
- Yes, ma'am.

406
00:41:19,561 --> 00:41:21,728
- Look at those knockers.
- Boys!

407
00:41:29,404 --> 00:41:32,072
Mother superior will see you now.

408
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:38,662
Mother, do you recognize this man?

409
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:40,914
Of course I know who he is.

410
00:41:41,082 --> 00:41:44,334
We called him Anthony,
after St. Anthony of Padua...

411
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:48,505
...healer of the mute.
Please come forward.

412
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:51,800
Please, girls.

413
00:41:58,016 --> 00:42:02,060
But his real name, like so much
about him, was a mystery.

414
00:42:05,106 --> 00:42:08,400
He came to us when he was 7.

415
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:13,572
He was found wandering in the hills,
living off roots and insects.

416
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:16,783
We believe his family was in
a Romanian circus troupe...

417
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:19,912
...who died in a terrible fire.

418
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:23,123
Although the doctors could find
nothing physically wrong...

419
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:25,250
...he never spoke a word.

420
00:42:25,418 --> 00:42:29,630
And there were other idiosyncrasies.
He was a painfully shy child...

421
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:34,134
...until it came time
for his monthly haircut.

422
00:42:43,311 --> 00:42:46,772
Then one morning, he was simply gone.

423
00:42:47,315 --> 00:42:49,775
The Thin Man was protecting Max.

424
00:42:51,194 --> 00:42:54,821
So you're saying this man is the sole
benefactor of your orphanage?

425
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:58,575
Yes, he really is an angel.

426
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:03,455
Mother, have you had contact with him since?

427
00:43:03,623 --> 00:43:05,582
Well, not really that much...

428
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:08,168
...except for the odd haircut
now and then.

429
00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:17,344
But he does send gifts.
Like this morning.

430
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,931
- Emmers' car.
- That is a nice ride.

431
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:25,852
An original 1967
numbers-matching GTO.

432
00:43:30,692 --> 00:43:33,193
- Thorn Birds.
- I know.

433
00:43:35,822 --> 00:43:37,322
Bird poo.

434
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:40,993
What order did you girls
say you were from again?

435
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,829
- Larus californicus.
- California gull.

436
00:43:43,997 --> 00:43:46,290
Fecal matter consists mostly
of scaly clypeiform.

437
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:49,209
Sardines that fed on large brown algae, I'd say.

438
00:43:49,377 --> 00:43:52,838
There's also traces of tanker fuel
and storm-water runoff as well.

439
00:43:53,006 --> 00:43:55,966
Sea gulls, tankers, storm water.

440
00:43:56,134 --> 00:43:58,552
San Pedro Harbor.

441
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:18,238
- Who are you?
- What?! Wait.

442
00:44:19,741 --> 00:44:21,033
- What?
- Who are you?

443
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,702
Oh, Jason Gibbons.

444
00:44:24,537 --> 00:44:26,330
The actor.

445
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:29,666
Maybe you've seen Maximum Extreme.

446
00:44:29,834 --> 00:44:31,335
No.

447
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:34,087
- It was such a big movie.
- What are you doing here?

448
00:44:34,255 --> 00:44:37,466
- I'm Alex's boyfriend.
- Alex's boyfriend.

449
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:40,719
Yeah. Well, technically,
we're on what she calls a time-out.

450
00:44:41,763 --> 00:44:44,765
- What does that mean?
- Exactly. Thank you.

451
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:49,853
Yeah. I gotta say, you must be
the world's most understanding father.

452
00:44:50,271 --> 00:44:52,939
- Why?
- All the wild stuff she does.

453
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:56,610
When I first met Alex,
I thought she was a bikini waxer.

454
00:44:57,779 --> 00:45:00,030
It was months before I knew about Charlie.

455
00:45:01,366 --> 00:45:02,741
Who's Charlie?

456
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:22,177
Merkin.

457
00:45:22,345 --> 00:45:25,389
That was the name of Seamus' pit bull.

458
00:45:27,767 --> 00:45:31,937
Armed guards.
Security looks pretty tight.

459
00:45:32,105 --> 00:45:34,689
This dock is like a fortress.

460
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:37,984
ID badges.
I think cargo's our best bet.

461
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:40,904
- Townsend Agency.
- Bos, recon incoming.

462
00:45:41,072 --> 00:45:44,032
- Got you, baby.
- Yeah, check the photo.

463
00:45:49,956 --> 00:45:52,332
That's our man.

464
00:45:53,835 --> 00:45:55,794
The Treasure Chest.

465
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:59,756
- Do a little dance.
- Make a little love.

466
00:46:00,675 --> 00:46:02,759
Get down tonight.

467
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:42,048
- There he is, first table on the right.
- Yeah, baby!

468
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:47,591
Hold.

469
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:02,439
- Paddy O'Malley?
- Top of the morning to you.

470
00:49:02,607 --> 00:49:07,360
You know, you just don't look much
like any Paddy I've ever seen before.

471
00:49:07,862 --> 00:49:09,738
Ain't never heard of no black Irish?

472
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:11,448
- Black Irish?
- That's right.

473
00:49:11,616 --> 00:49:14,618
Who do you think invented
the McRib, Lucky Charms, huh?

474
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:17,912
- Shamrock Shake? That's ours.
- Give me your papers.

475
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,873
- What?
- Your papers.

476
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:21,708
Let me tell you...

477
00:49:21,876 --> 00:49:24,377
...you got nerve to ask me
about my papers.

478
00:49:24,545 --> 00:49:26,880
My family suffered, man, for lack of potatoes.

479
00:49:27,048 --> 00:49:29,966
Foot-and-mouth disease.
Canker sores. Circumcision.

480
00:49:30,134 --> 00:49:33,053
- Circumcision?
- Right, my wife just had a set of twins.

481
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:34,971
- Both leprechauns.
- Leprechauns?

482
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:37,932
Get a whiff.
Irish Spring.

483
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:41,227
You don't believe that,
wipe your ass with a four-leaf clover.

484
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:43,438
McGinty!

485
00:49:43,606 --> 00:49:45,231
Get this stuff on the ship.

486
00:49:58,496 --> 00:50:00,830
- Tough, eh?
- That was heavy.

487
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:06,795
I say we should take a break.

488
00:50:22,937 --> 00:50:24,688
Wait a second.

489
00:50:24,897 --> 00:50:27,273
I smell a rat.

490
00:51:03,644 --> 00:51:06,104
This ring is pure platinum.

491
00:51:06,272 --> 00:51:07,939
The HALO rings are titanium.

492
00:51:08,441 --> 00:51:10,525
HALO data chips should be weightless...

493
00:51:10,693 --> 00:51:14,487
...surrounded by a hollow core
that prevents thermal induction.

494
00:51:14,655 --> 00:51:16,990
If the density of the object...

495
00:51:17,158 --> 00:51:22,454
...is less than that of the substance
in which it is immersed....

496
00:51:26,125 --> 00:51:27,625
It floats.

497
00:51:29,962 --> 00:51:32,172
There they are.

498
00:51:37,386 --> 00:51:41,181
I'm sure Helen Zaas was great,
but I just can't imagine life...

499
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:44,142
...without Dylan Sanders.

500
00:51:47,855 --> 00:51:50,815
- Come on, let's get out of here.
- Cheers to that.

501
00:51:52,193 --> 00:51:54,486
What's the rush, Helen?

502
00:51:59,283 --> 00:52:01,618
You've only been here five minutes.

503
00:52:03,204 --> 00:52:06,164
Now, I've waited for you before.

504
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:13,630
Matter of fact, I've waited for you 2920 days.

505
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:17,675
That's 417 weeks.

506
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:21,930
That's 96 months.

507
00:52:23,474 --> 00:52:25,600
That's eight years.

508
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:27,852
Enough about me.

509
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:30,104
What about you, Helen?
How have you been?

510
00:52:30,272 --> 00:52:32,190
Seamus.

511
00:52:32,358 --> 00:52:35,527
I see you still got a nice arse on you.

512
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,571
You got a lot of nerve stealing from me.

513
00:52:38,739 --> 00:52:42,200
- Stealing back's more like it.
- Give us the rings.

514
00:52:46,372 --> 00:52:48,373
Give us the rings.

515
00:53:01,512 --> 00:53:03,388
Give us the rings!

516
00:53:13,941 --> 00:53:17,902
Don't lose those.
We'll be taking them back in about...

517
00:53:19,572 --> 00:53:21,781
...48 seconds.

518
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:28,246
I've been dreaming one day
I'd get to see you again...

519
00:53:29,415 --> 00:53:30,832
...and watch you die.

520
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,167
Keep dreaming.

521
00:53:37,798 --> 00:53:40,592
Lights. Somebody get the lights!

522
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:43,261
Seamus.

523
00:53:44,013 --> 00:53:48,099
Seamus!

524
00:53:49,435 --> 00:53:51,769
You know I always like it with the light on.

525
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:51,621
- You don't know me anymore.
- I'm the only one here who knows you.

526
00:55:07,179 --> 00:55:08,763
Wait, wait, wait!

527
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:42,296
I've got to say, Helen,
I've never wanted you more.

528
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:44,590
- Always wanting what you can't have.
- Yeah?

529
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:53,433
I'll have you any way I want.

530
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:10,283
I got the rings.
Let's get out of here!

531
00:56:57,915 --> 00:56:59,791
Don't let them get away!

532
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:05,046
Got it?

533
00:57:21,522 --> 00:57:22,647
Come on, now!

534
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:36,369
Let's go.

535
00:57:44,378 --> 00:57:46,379
Dylan, let's go.

536
00:58:16,827 --> 00:58:19,912
You can't hurt me anymore, Helen.

537
00:58:20,372 --> 00:58:23,082
I'm gonna teach you and your friends about pain.

538
00:58:25,586 --> 00:58:29,589
I'm gonna kill them
just so you can hear them scream.

539
00:58:33,218 --> 00:58:35,094
Dylan!

540
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:39,098
I got the rings.

541
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:43,060
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

542
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:44,604
Hit it.

543
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:03,080
I know who did it.

544
00:59:04,708 --> 00:59:08,794
Hot damn it, I know who did it.

545
00:59:09,630 --> 00:59:13,174
Col. Mustard,
in the dining room, with a lead pipe.

546
00:59:13,342 --> 00:59:14,884
- Col. Mustard?
- Give me that.

547
00:59:15,052 --> 00:59:17,511
- Col. Mustard?
- I said, Col. Mustard...

548
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:20,181
...in the dining room,
with a lead pipe.

549
00:59:20,349 --> 00:59:23,267
- Go ahead and look in there.
- Why don't you look.

550
00:59:23,435 --> 00:59:25,478
Col. Must--

551
00:59:25,646 --> 00:59:27,021
- Col. Mustard?
- Right.

552
00:59:27,189 --> 00:59:30,066
Col. Mustard? Col. Mustard?

553
00:59:30,901 --> 00:59:32,985
It's Professor Plum...

554
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:36,030
...in the conservatory,
with a candlestick.

555
00:59:36,198 --> 00:59:38,491
That's right. You got it right.

556
00:59:38,659 --> 00:59:40,910
- Damn!
- How the hell you know that?

557
00:59:41,078 --> 00:59:45,331
We took in one just like him
a long time ago, remember?

558
00:59:45,499 --> 00:59:49,418
Yeah, Mama, I remember.
You gave my room away.

559
00:59:53,674 --> 00:59:56,592
You were the cock?
I was the beaver.

560
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:59,387
What are the chances that we were both mascots?

561
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:01,806
- Unbelievable.
- Oh, God.

562
01:00:01,974 --> 01:00:06,143
It's like we were made for each other.

563
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:11,023
The best I can figure it is,
the clients contact Charlie directly.

564
01:00:11,191 --> 01:00:13,359
Okay, then he phones the girls.

565
01:00:13,527 --> 01:00:17,363
They show up at the place and do their thing.

566
01:00:17,531 --> 01:00:20,700
Now, I know, I know.
At first, I didn't think I could handle it.

567
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:26,914
The late nights, the never knowing
when she'd have to go out on a job.

568
01:00:27,249 --> 01:00:29,625
Some of the men are pretty dangerous.

569
01:00:29,793 --> 01:00:32,628
And the outfits. Oh, boy.

570
01:00:37,884 --> 01:00:41,679
I'll be right back, Pete.
It's just number one. Have fun.

571
01:00:57,029 --> 01:00:58,529
Hello?

572
01:01:15,714 --> 01:01:19,925
I'm gonna say this. Our boy Pete
has no idea what he's getting into.

573
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:24,096
I don't think he really
understands the responsibility.

574
01:01:24,264 --> 01:01:26,766
- No, no.
- Pete?

575
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:29,685
- The commitment.
- Once they get into your house...

576
01:01:29,853 --> 01:01:31,729
- ...you lose all spontaneity.
- Gone.

577
01:01:31,897 --> 01:01:33,397
They do whatever they want.

578
01:01:33,565 --> 01:01:36,025
- Pete's asking her tonight?
- That's what he said.

579
01:01:40,364 --> 01:01:42,823
But Alex is a wildcat.

580
01:01:42,991 --> 01:01:46,952
I mean, she gives as good as she gets.

581
01:01:47,913 --> 01:01:49,288
Alex! Hey.

582
01:01:49,456 --> 01:01:52,666
Jason, Daddy.
What are you doing here, Jason?

583
01:01:52,834 --> 01:01:56,545
I was just explaining to your
father here all about Charlie.

584
01:01:57,381 --> 01:01:58,631
Charlie?

585
01:02:00,592 --> 01:02:03,427
- Daddy....
- It's all right, Alex. I know.

586
01:02:03,804 --> 01:02:05,971
I'm so sorry, Daddy, that I didn't tell you.

587
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:10,351
I didn't think you'd approve. I know
you wanted me to be a neurosurgeon.

588
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:15,106
But I've discovered
a whole new way to help people...

589
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:18,317
...that makes me feel so...

590
01:02:19,986 --> 01:02:21,987
...alive.

591
01:02:23,657 --> 01:02:25,408
Whatever makes you happy.

592
01:02:28,495 --> 01:02:30,329
I am so relieved!

593
01:02:30,997 --> 01:02:34,500
It's just been killing me,
you not knowing all these years. I--

594
01:02:34,835 --> 01:02:36,168
Daddy...

595
01:02:36,336 --> 01:02:39,296
...Natalie, Dylan and I are a team.

596
01:02:39,464 --> 01:02:43,509
And we just took on 12 sailors.

597
01:02:46,096 --> 01:02:50,057
You can't even imagine the
positions we get ourselves into.

598
01:02:50,392 --> 01:02:54,186
Daddy, I wish you could watch
us work. You'd be so proud.

599
01:02:54,938 --> 01:02:56,689
I'm gonna take a shower...

600
01:02:56,857 --> 01:03:00,484
...because I am covered in--
Well, you can only imagine what.

601
01:03:00,652 --> 01:03:03,821
And then when I get back, I am gonna give you...

602
01:03:03,989 --> 01:03:06,657
...a full blow-by-blow.

603
01:03:11,163 --> 01:03:12,329
Ferret.

604
01:03:28,513 --> 01:03:31,474
- Natalie?
- What, Pete?

605
01:03:32,309 --> 01:03:34,810
- I've been thinking.
- Yeah?

606
01:03:34,978 --> 01:03:38,981
- About what?
- Well, look...

607
01:03:39,524 --> 01:03:41,734
...I know we just moved in together.

608
01:03:41,902 --> 01:03:43,819
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

609
01:03:43,987 --> 01:03:48,157
And I know we agreed to take this kind of slow.

610
01:03:48,742 --> 01:03:50,659
- But--
- Yeah?

611
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:54,455
There's just something I gotta ask.

612
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:59,210
- Oh, boy.
- Yeah. "Oh, boy" is right.

613
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:01,337
So here it goes.

614
01:04:01,505 --> 01:04:03,881
- Twirl me first.
- Okay.

615
01:04:18,772 --> 01:04:20,022
Yeah.

616
01:04:25,278 --> 01:04:27,029
Hey!

617
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:12,199
- About that question, Pete?
- Let's talk about it later.

618
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:11,008
"Here's all your stuff back."

619
01:06:11,176 --> 01:06:12,468
What's up with that?

620
01:06:13,261 --> 01:06:15,054
She's gone.

621
01:06:15,764 --> 01:06:17,848
She's not coming back.

622
01:06:18,224 --> 01:06:19,975
She loved these boots.

623
01:06:20,143 --> 01:06:22,686
She doesn't want us to get hurt.

624
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:27,107
Wait a minute,
you ladies risk your ass every day.

625
01:06:27,275 --> 01:06:28,525
Yeah.

626
01:06:28,693 --> 01:06:31,528
"I'll never forgive myself
if anything happens to you."

627
01:06:31,696 --> 01:06:33,489
Where do we go from here, Charlie?

628
01:06:33,657 --> 01:06:36,992
Natalie, Alex.
You need to keep your spirits up.

629
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:39,036
Any leads on the O'Gradys, Charlie?

630
01:06:39,204 --> 01:06:41,330
Any word on how Seamus broke out of prison?

631
01:06:41,498 --> 01:06:44,083
He didn't break out, Natalie.
He was released.

632
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:47,586
What? Who would have the power
to pull something like that off?

633
01:06:48,088 --> 01:06:49,922
Johnnie Cochran.

634
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:53,258
The Justice Department,
the DA's office, the FBI.

635
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:56,011
U.S. Marshal.

636
01:06:57,847 --> 01:06:59,098
That's Carter.

637
01:07:05,188 --> 01:07:08,023
I never gave rings to a guy before.

638
01:07:08,608 --> 01:07:10,442
The rings are secure, sir.

639
01:07:10,610 --> 01:07:12,903
And we can all breathe a little easier.

640
01:07:13,071 --> 01:07:16,031
- Well done, Angels.
- Thanks, Charlie.

641
01:07:16,199 --> 01:07:18,283
HALO is safe, thanks to you.

642
01:07:18,451 --> 01:07:20,160
It's been a pleasure.

643
01:07:20,453 --> 01:07:22,996
I hope to work with you ladies again.

644
01:07:23,498 --> 01:07:24,790
But not too soon.

645
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:27,251
Good luck with everything.

646
01:07:29,796 --> 01:07:31,296
Your keys.

647
01:07:35,844 --> 01:07:38,137
- What is it?
- My ribs.

648
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:44,435
These aren't mine.

649
01:07:49,274 --> 01:07:53,235
That was a nice reach for a guy
with a couple of fractured ribs.

650
01:07:53,403 --> 01:07:55,487
Good going, Bos.

651
01:07:55,655 --> 01:07:57,781
- We got him.
- We got who?

652
01:07:57,949 --> 01:08:01,910
Of course, he already had one ring.
He just needed the other.

653
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:05,372
He wanted to fake his own death
so he wouldn't be a suspect.

654
01:08:05,540 --> 01:08:07,166
Who you all talking about?

655
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:09,543
He needed time for his plan,
so he set up Seamus.

656
01:08:09,711 --> 01:08:11,295
Then turned him loose on Dylan.

657
01:08:11,463 --> 01:08:13,464
I think you're onto something, Angels.

658
01:08:13,715 --> 01:08:16,759
Damn! So Carter's the bad guy!

659
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:21,597
It's just speculation at this point,
Bosley. We need proof.

660
01:08:21,890 --> 01:08:23,557
- Keys, Bosley.
- Let's hit it.

661
01:08:23,725 --> 01:08:25,225
Punk.

662
01:08:45,413 --> 01:08:47,331
Road's clear.
You're good to move in.

663
01:08:52,712 --> 01:08:54,463
Almost there.

664
01:08:56,633 --> 01:08:58,383
Oncoming.

665
01:09:09,062 --> 01:09:10,562
Good job, Alex.

666
01:09:15,193 --> 01:09:16,944
- Can we go yet?
- No, you can't, son.

667
01:09:17,111 --> 01:09:18,570
I gotta make sure it's safe.

668
01:09:18,738 --> 01:09:21,824
- We're gonna be late.
- You're not gonna be late, young ma--

669
01:09:21,991 --> 01:09:23,242
You old grizzly bear!

670
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:25,494
Son, please work with me, young man.

671
01:09:25,662 --> 01:09:29,248
A few more minutes and you'll be
in school. You'll never see me again.

672
01:09:29,415 --> 01:09:32,751
Man, you do not mess with a black man's do!

673
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:39,550
I got the phone line.

674
01:09:45,765 --> 01:09:47,599
I'm calling from my car.
Go secure.

675
01:09:50,770 --> 01:09:53,772
My end of the deal's done.
The Angels are off the case.

676
01:09:54,274 --> 01:09:56,358
I have the rings.

677
01:09:57,485 --> 01:09:58,694
Dylan.

678
01:10:04,576 --> 01:10:06,743
Alex! Alex!

679
01:10:06,911 --> 01:10:08,537
Call buyer one.

680
01:10:08,705 --> 01:10:09,955
Alex, are you okay?

681
01:10:10,123 --> 01:10:12,624
Nat, the handle's broken.
I can't disengage.

682
01:10:12,876 --> 01:10:15,627
The deal's on. Eight o'clock,
just as we discussed.

683
01:10:15,795 --> 01:10:17,629
- Nat, plan B!
- I'm calling in Bosley.

684
01:10:17,797 --> 01:10:20,424
We'll get you out of there, Alex.
Hang tight.

685
01:10:21,634 --> 01:10:23,594
Follow the stars beyond the galaxy.

686
01:10:25,972 --> 01:10:28,599
Take shore to hope.
Stop on a stair.

687
01:10:28,766 --> 01:10:30,142
A stair?

688
01:10:30,727 --> 01:10:31,977
Find a man with a map.

689
01:10:32,145 --> 01:10:33,645
Bosley, can you hear me?

690
01:10:33,813 --> 01:10:37,149
Bosley, we're going
to Bravo configuration immediately.

691
01:10:37,317 --> 01:10:38,984
I'm on it. I'm on it. Okay?

692
01:10:39,152 --> 01:10:42,404
Now, get back. We're going
to Bravo configuration. Get back!

693
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:49,244
Stop!

694
01:10:57,545 --> 01:11:00,756
- Come on.
- Okay. Come on, hurry.

695
01:11:01,507 --> 01:11:03,926
Skip. Run.

696
01:11:08,431 --> 01:11:09,681
Get on out of here.

697
01:11:09,849 --> 01:11:12,517
Come on. Get on out of here.

698
01:11:18,942 --> 01:11:22,110
- Great job, Bos.
- Yeah, right.

699
01:11:22,403 --> 01:11:25,739
Carter's working with a partner.
They're selling the list tonight.

700
01:11:25,907 --> 01:11:28,200
We'll take care of them and then find Dylan.

701
01:11:28,368 --> 01:11:31,453
- See you, Bos.
- Yeah, all right, all right.

702
01:11:33,998 --> 01:11:36,166
This is some bullshit.

703
01:12:21,045 --> 01:12:24,172
- Kelly Garrett.
- Hello, Dylan.

704
01:12:24,382 --> 01:12:26,842
Don't you have a case to solve?

705
01:12:29,137 --> 01:12:33,348
Well, I tried to outrun my past,
but it caught up with me yesterday.

706
01:12:33,516 --> 01:12:35,517
And I put my friends in danger.

707
01:12:35,685 --> 01:12:38,645
They're in more danger now without you.

708
01:12:39,731 --> 01:12:42,941
Natalie and Alex are gonna
replace me with someone great.

709
01:12:43,109 --> 01:12:47,779
A real Angel. Not someone who's
pretending to be something she's not.

710
01:12:47,947 --> 01:12:51,658
Your past is what makes you who you are, Dylan.

711
01:12:51,826 --> 01:12:55,328
Don't forget that Charlie chose you
for a reason.

712
01:12:56,497 --> 01:12:58,457
Angels are like diamonds.

713
01:12:58,624 --> 01:13:01,585
They can't be made.
You have to find them.

714
01:13:03,504 --> 01:13:05,672
Each one is unique.

715
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:13,930
Sometimes we search too hard
for answers that are right in front of us.

716
01:14:23,042 --> 01:14:24,918
The buyers are set.

717
01:14:25,253 --> 01:14:27,379
We did it, partner!

718
01:14:57,785 --> 01:15:00,328
You know, I never really got that partner thing.

719
01:15:12,466 --> 01:15:13,800
Hello, Angels.

720
01:15:14,802 --> 01:15:16,094
Madison Lee.

721
01:15:17,346 --> 01:15:18,638
Why?

722
01:15:18,806 --> 01:15:21,016
Why be an Angel when I can play God?

723
01:15:22,393 --> 01:15:25,979
Looks like one of the three
amigos has gone adiós.

724
01:15:43,998 --> 01:15:45,290
Welcome back, Dylan.

725
01:15:45,458 --> 01:15:47,918
You're such a typical rebellious Pisces.

726
01:15:48,085 --> 01:15:50,212
Always out to prove how tough you are...

727
01:15:50,379 --> 01:15:53,340
...and you couldn't make it
one day on your own, could you?

728
01:15:53,507 --> 01:15:57,510
Someone reminded me that every Angel is unique.

729
01:15:58,012 --> 01:15:59,679
And I knew it was you.

730
01:15:59,847 --> 01:16:01,973
Who else had contacts in Mongolia...

731
01:16:02,141 --> 01:16:05,644
...could hack the HALO fail-safe
and hire a surfer as an assassin?

732
01:16:05,811 --> 01:16:09,022
Same astrological phenom who would
refer to a motocross rider...

733
01:16:09,190 --> 01:16:11,858
...with a lion on his helmet as "Leo."

734
01:16:14,862 --> 01:16:17,656
Very well done.

735
01:16:17,907 --> 01:16:20,450
Very impressive, really.

736
01:16:20,743 --> 01:16:23,870
You've got it all figured out.

737
01:16:24,789 --> 01:16:27,999
And now I'm gonna really enjoy...

738
01:16:28,167 --> 01:16:30,961
...knocking those halos right
off your heads.

739
01:16:31,754 --> 01:16:33,421
But you're an Angel.

740
01:16:33,589 --> 01:16:36,424
No. You just don't get it.

741
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:40,387
I don't take orders from a speaker box anymore.

742
01:16:40,721 --> 01:16:42,722
I work for myself.

743
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:45,600
Well, your boss sucks.

744
01:16:48,062 --> 01:16:50,480
The Angels' ass-kicking pose.

745
01:16:50,648 --> 01:16:52,482
Seeing the three of you like that...

746
01:16:52,650 --> 01:16:57,279
...does give me this little twinge
of nostalgia for the old days.

747
01:16:57,738 --> 01:17:00,031
But back then, it was a little bit different.

748
01:17:00,199 --> 01:17:03,201
You see, when I was an Angel...

749
01:17:03,536 --> 01:17:05,495
...we used guns.

750
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:31,813
Sorry, Charlie.

751
01:17:58,883 --> 01:18:01,009
Hello, Angels.

752
01:18:01,927 --> 01:18:04,095
Good evening, Charlie.

753
01:18:04,263 --> 01:18:06,056
I love the new office.

754
01:18:06,223 --> 01:18:08,808
Madison, is that you?
Where are the Angels?

755
01:18:08,976 --> 01:18:11,561
I'm sure there's three more
where they came from.

756
01:18:11,729 --> 01:18:14,147
Madison, what have you done?

757
01:18:14,315 --> 01:18:19,319
We're just having a little fun.
You shouldn't worry yourself, Charlie.

758
01:18:19,487 --> 01:18:21,154
You've never had trouble...

759
01:18:21,322 --> 01:18:23,740
...finding someone
to give their life for you.

760
01:18:23,908 --> 01:18:28,703
Hurting the Angels doesn't prove
you're the best. You know that.

761
01:18:28,954 --> 01:18:30,121
Do I?

762
01:18:30,289 --> 01:18:33,333
Madison, you were never able
to accept that this agency...

763
01:18:33,501 --> 01:18:36,336
...is about teamwork.
We're a family. We do--

764
01:18:36,587 --> 01:18:40,632
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.
Angels forever.

765
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:43,468
I've heard the sales pitch.

766
01:18:46,180 --> 01:18:48,765
It was very seductive...

767
01:18:50,184 --> 01:18:51,851
...once.

768
01:18:52,019 --> 01:18:55,772
Madison, you deliberately went
rogue on the DeSoto case...

769
01:18:55,940 --> 01:18:59,317
...and put your fellow Angels
in danger.

770
01:18:59,485 --> 01:19:01,403
When we finally got you out of there...

771
01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:05,407
...you were wounded so badly,
we thought we might lose you.

772
01:19:05,866 --> 01:19:07,992
You did lose me.

773
01:19:08,244 --> 01:19:11,579
You see, being an Angel
wasn't fulfilling my destiny.

774
01:19:11,747 --> 01:19:14,124
It was keeping me from it.

775
01:19:14,291 --> 01:19:16,793
Your destiny is yet to be written.

776
01:19:16,961 --> 01:19:19,170
Do not do this, Madison.

777
01:19:19,338 --> 01:19:23,591
Taking the lives of innocent people
is not the answer.

778
01:19:23,759 --> 01:19:27,804
There must be something
in you that's still good.

779
01:19:35,229 --> 01:19:38,314
I was never good.

780
01:19:41,902 --> 01:19:44,237
I was great.

781
01:20:10,139 --> 01:20:13,641
Damn. What a bitch!

782
01:20:37,791 --> 01:20:40,126
You guys, we have to outthink Madison.

783
01:20:40,294 --> 01:20:43,254
No matter what we do,
she's always two steps ahead of us.

784
01:20:43,422 --> 01:20:46,716
- She's selling the list off tonight, 8:00.
- But where?

785
01:20:46,884 --> 01:20:49,302
- Nat, what else did Carter say?
- Okay.

786
01:20:49,470 --> 01:20:51,888
"Take the stars beyond the galaxy."

787
01:20:52,056 --> 01:20:53,890
It's safe to say it's on this planet.

788
01:20:54,058 --> 01:20:58,770
"Take shore to hope
and stop on a stair."

789
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:03,399
- There's a Hope Street downtown.
- But no shore for miles.

790
01:21:03,859 --> 01:21:05,610
A stair.

791
01:21:07,154 --> 01:21:09,155
Astaire!

792
01:21:10,866 --> 01:21:12,534
Astaire?

793
01:21:12,701 --> 01:21:13,993
Astaire!

794
01:21:14,161 --> 01:21:16,162
- Possible concussion.
- I'm worried.

795
01:21:16,622 --> 01:21:20,124
Guys, the stars.
Hollywood Walk of Fame.

796
01:21:20,626 --> 01:21:23,336
Beyond the Galaxy Theatre.

797
01:21:23,504 --> 01:21:26,673
There's Dinah Shore, Bob Hope and Fred Astaire.

798
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:29,342
- Nice, Nat.
- Yeah!

799
01:21:41,397 --> 01:21:43,481
I think she's trying to kill us.

800
01:22:05,379 --> 01:22:07,797
I can't believe it.
We are here in Hollywood.

801
01:22:07,965 --> 01:22:09,841
- Angels?
- I knew we were gonna do it--

802
01:22:10,009 --> 01:22:11,342
- Shut up, damn it!
- What?

803
01:22:11,510 --> 01:22:13,052
I mean, not you, Mama. Sorry.

804
01:22:13,220 --> 01:22:16,556
- Have you lost your mind?
- Yeah. I mean, no.

805
01:22:16,724 --> 01:22:18,308
We gonna talk about this later.

806
01:22:42,333 --> 01:22:45,960
- Welcome to the Guinness World of--
- Shut it.

807
01:22:46,253 --> 01:22:48,004
Give us the map.

808
01:23:33,258 --> 01:23:35,843
Yahtzee!

809
01:23:41,225 --> 01:23:44,477
Jason! Jason!

810
01:23:45,604 --> 01:23:46,646
Jason!

811
01:23:47,481 --> 01:23:49,440
I love you!

812
01:23:55,239 --> 01:23:57,907
- I hear the sequel's insane.
- First one was a classic.

813
01:23:58,075 --> 01:23:59,117
Button your jacket.

814
01:23:59,284 --> 01:24:00,618
- What?
- Button your jacket.

815
01:24:41,952 --> 01:24:44,871
The VIP gathering is on the top floor.

816
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:50,061
You're under arrest for conspiracy
to obstruct justice.

817
01:25:50,229 --> 01:25:51,938
Freeze!

818
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:44,532
The Kleinhardt gambit.

819
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:48,870
- Classic.
- And apparently still effective.

820
01:26:57,880 --> 01:27:01,173
We never used to wear Kevlar
till I took three in the chest.

821
01:27:01,508 --> 01:27:04,510
On the DeSoto case! We know!

822
01:27:09,433 --> 01:27:11,726
Don't tell me you forgot about...

823
01:27:12,144 --> 01:27:14,312
...plan B.

824
01:27:19,693 --> 01:27:22,570
I'd recognize that arse anywhere,
you piece of sh--!

825
01:27:31,371 --> 01:27:33,706
Bring it on, bitch.

826
01:29:09,761 --> 01:29:11,554
Say something.

827
01:29:20,564 --> 01:29:22,857
Mind if I cut in?

828
01:29:23,025 --> 01:29:24,817
No!

829
01:30:47,192 --> 01:30:49,318
The premiere should be a blast.

830
01:31:04,376 --> 01:31:06,669
Bosley, plan B!

831
01:31:06,837 --> 01:31:08,295
It's raining white women!

832
01:31:14,261 --> 01:31:17,680
Plan B stands for "plan Bosley."

833
01:31:22,936 --> 01:31:24,687
Yeah!

834
01:31:25,522 --> 01:31:28,190
Get that bitch! Get that bitch!

835
01:31:28,483 --> 01:31:32,695
Wow. They really went
all out for this thing. Okay!

836
01:32:20,785 --> 01:32:21,827
Dylan!

837
01:32:27,459 --> 01:32:29,293
Alex!

838
01:33:49,416 --> 01:33:51,125
This is it. You ready?

839
01:33:52,794 --> 01:33:54,420
Are you?

840
01:34:09,144 --> 01:34:10,519
Kill...

841
01:34:10,812 --> 01:34:12,771
...or be killed.

842
01:34:13,231 --> 01:34:15,149
Exciting, isn't it?

843
01:34:16,359 --> 01:34:17,776
Who are you?

844
01:34:19,571 --> 01:34:22,406
You want to know who I am, Natalie?

845
01:34:23,241 --> 01:34:25,326
Then you look inside your own heart.

846
01:34:25,952 --> 01:34:27,995
No, Madison.

847
01:34:28,330 --> 01:34:30,164
I'm nothing like you.

848
01:34:31,499 --> 01:34:33,667
I have something you'll never have.

849
01:34:42,510 --> 01:34:44,887
And what's that?

850
01:34:49,184 --> 01:34:51,018
Friends.

851
01:35:20,548 --> 01:35:23,467
- Enjoy heaven.
- Go to hell.

852
01:35:58,420 --> 01:36:00,295
She is so fired.

853
01:36:16,104 --> 01:36:17,855
Party time.

854
01:36:28,199 --> 01:36:29,366
- Angels!
- Bosley!

855
01:36:29,534 --> 01:36:31,368
Angels!

856
01:36:33,371 --> 01:36:35,664
- You all get that squirrel-flying lady?
- Yeah!

857
01:36:35,832 --> 01:36:37,207
- Did you scratch her?
- Yeah!

858
01:36:37,375 --> 01:36:41,128
You kick her? You kicked her
kung fu ass? Mama, I told you!

859
01:36:41,296 --> 01:36:42,713
I know it!

860
01:36:42,964 --> 01:36:46,300
- We couldn't have done it without you.
- Never!

861
01:36:46,634 --> 01:36:48,385
- You hear that, Mama?
- I heard it.

862
01:36:48,553 --> 01:36:51,597
I've always known my baby boy was a genius!

863
01:36:51,764 --> 01:36:53,932
Why you give my room away, then, Mama?

864
01:36:54,100 --> 01:36:57,019
I'll tell you why. Max?

865
01:36:57,187 --> 01:36:59,480
Yeah? I'm a Bosley now!

866
01:36:59,647 --> 01:37:02,524
- Max Bosley!
- I love Max Bosley!

867
01:37:02,692 --> 01:37:04,651
- Boy, you did it!
- Hallelujah!

868
01:37:04,819 --> 01:37:07,321
Daddy! One second. Daddy!

869
01:37:07,489 --> 01:37:09,948
Darling! You made it!

870
01:37:10,116 --> 01:37:14,328
We just got done.
Another satisfied client.

871
01:37:14,621 --> 01:37:16,955
We finished her off sooner than we thought.

872
01:37:17,123 --> 01:37:18,790
- Her?
- It was a woman this time.

873
01:37:18,958 --> 01:37:22,169
We had to triple-team her,
but we finally got her on her back!

874
01:37:24,964 --> 01:37:26,882
Well done!

875
01:37:27,258 --> 01:37:29,343
No, no, no!

876
01:37:32,430 --> 01:37:35,349
- Jason!
- Alex. You made it.

877
01:37:36,100 --> 01:37:39,645
No, no, no! I know.
We're on a time-out, I know.

878
01:37:39,812 --> 01:37:44,024
Time-out's over, baby.
We're back in the game!

879
01:37:50,698 --> 01:37:52,407
Ferret.

880
01:38:04,462 --> 01:38:07,506
I know you wanted to wait
and everything, but--

881
01:38:11,052 --> 01:38:14,805
- You really look beautiful.
- Thanks, Pete.

882
01:38:14,973 --> 01:38:18,058
I've been wanting to ask you this
for a long time.

883
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:20,894
So here goes.

884
01:38:21,896 --> 01:38:23,647
Pete.

885
01:38:35,577 --> 01:38:38,495
- Spike?
- Yeah. A puppy.

886
01:38:38,663 --> 01:38:40,581
A puppy?

887
01:38:40,748 --> 01:38:43,834
- Is that okay? I know it's a big step.
- Yes!

888
01:38:44,085 --> 01:38:45,544
I already got him.

889
01:38:45,712 --> 01:38:47,921
- You did?
- Yeah.

890
01:38:52,218 --> 01:38:54,386
Dylan! Dylan!

891
01:38:54,762 --> 01:38:56,388
Guess what.

892
01:38:56,556 --> 01:38:58,432
Pete and I have something to tell you.

893
01:38:58,600 --> 01:38:59,933
- Really?
- We're gonna get--

894
01:39:00,101 --> 01:39:03,687
- You're gonna get what?
- A puppy!

895
01:39:03,855 --> 01:39:06,315
- A puppy! That's great!
- Yes.

896
01:39:06,482 --> 01:39:08,317
- I already got him.
- You did.

897
01:39:08,484 --> 01:39:10,819
- Awesome!
- His name is Spike!

898
01:39:11,112 --> 01:39:14,448
- So you're not leaving?
- No! Of course, you guys.

899
01:39:14,616 --> 01:39:18,660
I get to kick butt with my two best
friends. You think I'd give that up?

900
01:39:18,828 --> 01:39:20,787
No!

901
01:39:21,122 --> 01:39:22,497
What about you, Dylan?

902
01:39:22,665 --> 01:39:25,208
With O'Grady out,
you can go back to your old life.

903
01:39:25,376 --> 01:39:28,420
Are you kidding? This is my life.

904
01:39:28,588 --> 01:39:32,341
- What about you, neurosurgeon?
- It's a no-brainer!

905
01:39:32,508 --> 01:39:36,762
I love our family!

906
01:39:54,155 --> 01:39:55,822
God!

907
01:40:00,119 --> 01:40:03,372
And I know we agreed to take things slow.

908
01:40:03,998 --> 01:40:06,667
- Yeah?
- But....

909
01:40:06,834 --> 01:40:08,502
- You--
- Sorry.

910
01:40:17,136 --> 01:40:19,846
There's an ember in my ass.

911
01:40:26,813 --> 01:40:29,106
We should get this to the lab and analyze it.

912
01:40:29,273 --> 01:40:31,191
Yeah, just crawl right up in there.

913
01:40:31,359 --> 01:40:33,026
I have.

914
01:40:42,620 --> 01:40:44,705
I like the patch.

915
01:40:46,958 --> 01:40:48,875
Let me see your patch.

916
01:40:57,093 --> 01:40:58,802
Hello?

917
01:41:00,304 --> 01:41:01,722
Is this Natalie?

918
01:41:01,889 --> 01:41:03,140
Okay!

919
01:41:07,562 --> 01:41:09,062
I'm on fire!

920
01:41:17,572 --> 01:41:19,156
Look around.

921
01:41:19,323 --> 01:41:20,907
Over your right shoulder.

922
01:41:21,075 --> 01:41:23,368
Is somebody coming up behind me?

923
01:46:42,730 --> 01:46:45,065
I am getting pelted.

924
01:46:45,232 --> 01:46:47,025
Pelted by the--

925
01:46:47,193 --> 01:46:50,236
- I literally--
- I have it in--
