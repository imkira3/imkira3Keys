1
00:01:49,007 --> 00:01:52,260
Your brother's soul is mine.

2
00:01:52,343 --> 00:01:53,594
Liu!

3
00:01:54,636 --> 00:01:57,389
You will be next.

4
00:02:07,607 --> 00:02:09,024
Chan.

5
00:02:29,209 --> 00:02:33,003
"Liu Kang - Brother Dead.
Return home. Grandfather"

6
00:02:41,803 --> 00:02:42,845
Let's go.

7
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:45,972
ls the perimeter secured?

8
00:02:46,056 --> 00:02:48,683
- Yes!
- Better be, l want Kano.

9
00:02:48,767 --> 00:02:52,978
- Trust me.
- l trust 1 person. You talk to her.

10
00:03:12,579 --> 00:03:14,206
Good boy.

11
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:17,750
She's here.

12
00:03:18,584 --> 00:03:20,503
Right on time.

13
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:25,882
l love punctuality in a woman...

14
00:03:26,925 --> 00:03:28,802
don't you...

15
00:03:28,885 --> 00:03:30,678
Mr. Shang Tsung?

16
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,976
Now, you're sure she'll follow me?

17
00:03:37,934 --> 00:03:39,978
You killed her partner, didn't you?

18
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:43,398
She'll follow you into hell.

19
00:03:43,481 --> 00:03:45,691
Just make sure she's on that boat.

20
00:03:45,774 --> 00:03:49,361
Sonya Blade must be at the tournament.

21
00:03:53,197 --> 00:03:55,616
Me and Sonya should share a cabin.

22
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,911
Have our own little honeymoon cruise.

23
00:03:58,995 --> 00:04:02,622
lf you so much as touch her, Kano...

24
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:06,501
you'll need a seeing eye dog.

25
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:44,700
Where's Kano?

26
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:48,496
Where is he?

27
00:05:21,525 --> 00:05:22,650
Let's dance.

28
00:05:55,345 --> 00:05:57,431
This is where you fall down.

29
00:06:01,434 --> 00:06:05,062
Where do you get these guys?

30
00:06:05,146 --> 00:06:07,772
The press says l don't know
how to do this stuff?

31
00:06:07,856 --> 00:06:11,818
- Cut. Reset. Back in 15.
- l won't do it again.

32
00:06:11,901 --> 00:06:13,570
- What do you mean?
- l won't.

33
00:06:13,653 --> 00:06:16,488
- lt's the last shot! Where you going?
- To my trailer.

34
00:06:16,572 --> 00:06:19,533
Then l'll shoot myself for being
in your movie.

35
00:06:19,616 --> 00:06:22,243
Kill me.
l'll be back directing traffic.

36
00:06:22,326 --> 00:06:25,038
Don't leave me hanging up here.
You're killing me!

37
00:06:25,121 --> 00:06:26,998
l love you. l need you.

38
00:06:27,081 --> 00:06:29,207
Excuse me,

39
00:06:29,249 --> 00:06:32,044
there's someone who wants
to speak to you.

40
00:06:32,127 --> 00:06:34,588
- Who is it?
- l don't really know.

41
00:06:34,671 --> 00:06:38,716
- You don't know who's on the set?
- No, of course not. l...

42
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:42,053
- lt had better not be a reporter.
- Oh God, no.

43
00:06:42,094 --> 00:06:43,721
You want me to find out?

44
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,392
Oh, great.

45
00:06:49,434 --> 00:06:51,394
Mister, you're in my chair.

46
00:06:51,436 --> 00:06:53,562
"Johnny Cage A Fake!"

47
00:06:55,939 --> 00:06:57,733
Hi, Johnny.

48
00:06:58,942 --> 00:07:00,735
Master Boyd.

49
00:07:00,818 --> 00:07:04,614
The press is still giving you
a hard time.

50
00:07:04,697 --> 00:07:06,531
Yeah, they think l'm a fake.

51
00:07:06,615 --> 00:07:10,410
You're one of the best
martial artists in the world...

52
00:07:10,494 --> 00:07:13,288
and l can help you prove it.

53
00:07:13,372 --> 00:07:14,455
Prove it? How?

54
00:07:14,538 --> 00:07:16,248
A tournament.

55
00:07:16,332 --> 00:07:17,750
The tournament.

56
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:21,003
lt's held once a generation.

57
00:07:22,295 --> 00:07:24,589
The world's best fighters
are invited.

58
00:07:24,672 --> 00:07:28,218
You win the tournament,
you win their respect.

59
00:07:28,301 --> 00:07:32,096
They'll tell the entire world
you're the real goods.

60
00:07:32,179 --> 00:07:34,598
- So how do l...?
- There's a boat.

61
00:07:34,682 --> 00:07:36,641
Leaves pier forty...

62
00:07:36,683 --> 00:07:38,601
Hong Kong, tomorrow.

63
00:07:38,643 --> 00:07:40,436
Be on it.

64
00:07:56,492 --> 00:07:58,827
"The Temple of Light, China"

65
00:08:36,568 --> 00:08:37,986
Liu.

66
00:08:47,578 --> 00:08:49,580
ls this the place?

67
00:08:49,621 --> 00:08:51,122
Yes.

68
00:08:51,205 --> 00:08:53,916
This is where we found his body.

69
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,710
What happened?

70
00:08:55,793 --> 00:08:58,254
After you left for America...

71
00:08:58,338 --> 00:09:00,505
he followed in your footsteps.

72
00:09:00,589 --> 00:09:02,382
Preparing for the tournament.

73
00:09:02,424 --> 00:09:06,594
Grandfather ... it wasn't enough
to fill my head with that nonsense?

74
00:09:06,677 --> 00:09:09,263
To save the world is not nonsense.

75
00:09:09,347 --> 00:09:13,683
Men fighting in a simple contest
don't decide these things.

76
00:09:13,767 --> 00:09:15,435
How can a wise man believe this?

77
00:09:15,518 --> 00:09:17,437
We all believe in it...

78
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,397
including your brother.

79
00:09:35,495 --> 00:09:38,246
Liu Kang has been given the dream.

80
00:09:38,288 --> 00:09:40,207
He is the Chosen One.

81
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:45,086
No. He left our temple.
Turned his back on us.

82
00:09:45,127 --> 00:09:48,005
Why have you come back?

83
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:51,549
l want to represent the Order of Light
at the Tournament.

84
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:53,259
For what reason?

85
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:56,096
My brother's killer will be there.

86
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:59,306
That cannot be your only reason
for going...

87
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,600
or you will fail.

88
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:04,269
Oh yes, l forgot.

89
00:10:04,311 --> 00:10:07,355
We're fighting for the fate
of the world.

90
00:10:07,438 --> 00:10:09,607
That's why you left the temple...

91
00:10:09,691 --> 00:10:12,485
and ran away, isn't it?

92
00:10:21,742 --> 00:10:26,122
The Great Tournament
was too much responsibility.

93
00:10:26,163 --> 00:10:27,665
But vengeance...

94
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:32,085
that's so much simpler.

95
00:10:32,168 --> 00:10:34,087
Lord Rayden.

96
00:10:37,506 --> 00:10:40,092
You're still running away
from your destiny.

97
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:46,264
Rayden?

98
00:10:47,098 --> 00:10:48,641
Grandfather, get up.

99
00:10:48,725 --> 00:10:51,518
This isn't your God of Thunder.

100
00:10:51,601 --> 00:10:54,604
- He's a beggar.
- Spare him, my Lord Rayden.

101
00:10:54,688 --> 00:10:57,774
American life has enfeebled his mind.

102
00:10:57,858 --> 00:10:59,692
Too much television.

103
00:10:59,775 --> 00:11:02,278
So, you're going to
win the tournament?

104
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:04,780
- Yes, l am.
- Show me how.

105
00:11:08,366 --> 00:11:10,827
Oh, don't tell me you're afraid...

106
00:11:10,869 --> 00:11:12,579
of a simple beggar?

107
00:11:26,424 --> 00:11:28,342
lf you are Rayden...

108
00:11:29,426 --> 00:11:31,762
why did you let Chan die?

109
00:11:31,845 --> 00:11:35,306
- Why didn't you protect him?
- Why didn't you?

110
00:11:36,849 --> 00:11:38,934
l've had enough of this.

111
00:11:40,603 --> 00:11:43,521
l'll find my brother's killer
at the tournament.

112
00:11:43,563 --> 00:11:46,858
With or without your consent.

113
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:58,117
He isn't ready, my Lord...

114
00:11:58,201 --> 00:12:00,161
and we lost so much time.

115
00:12:00,244 --> 00:12:02,288
l know.

116
00:12:02,372 --> 00:12:04,165
But there is no one else.

117
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:21,930
"Chai Wan Bay, Hong Kong"

118
00:12:33,524 --> 00:12:35,274
Ah, give me a break.

119
00:12:39,529 --> 00:12:41,739
"Johnny Cage Fake!"

120
00:12:42,823 --> 00:12:44,449
- Sure.

121
00:12:45,867 --> 00:12:47,619
Aren't you Art Lean?

122
00:12:47,703 --> 00:12:50,705
l saw you fight in London,
you're great.

123
00:12:50,788 --> 00:12:55,584
Thanks. l saw some of your films.
You can't fake those moves.

124
00:12:55,668 --> 00:12:57,836
Yeah, well, tell that to the press.

125
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:05,134
Pal, when the ship comes in...

126
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:07,553
could you put these on board?

127
00:13:07,636 --> 00:13:09,638
You want me to carry your luggage?

128
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:13,266
l pay money. You carry bags.

129
00:13:13,349 --> 00:13:16,394
- Or is that too complicated?
- No.

130
00:13:16,477 --> 00:13:17,603
l got it.

131
00:13:17,687 --> 00:13:19,105
Good.

132
00:13:32,867 --> 00:13:36,036
Thank God l didn't ask him
to park the car.

133
00:13:40,165 --> 00:13:43,417
Nothing says that creep at the club
wasn't lying.

134
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,919
Kano could be 1000 miles
from here by now.

135
00:13:50,923 --> 00:13:52,216
What is that?

136
00:14:02,225 --> 00:14:04,353
You must be kidding me.

137
00:14:22,576 --> 00:14:24,036
Wait.

138
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:26,038
That's it, Blade...

139
00:14:26,747 --> 00:14:28,539
come to Papa.

140
00:14:37,464 --> 00:14:39,508
Sonya, don't get on that thing.

141
00:14:39,591 --> 00:14:41,218
Hey, Sonya!

142
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:05,405
Hey, you.

143
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,783
Alright, tough guy, you want to get...

144
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:09,951
tough?

145
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,577
No. Do you?

146
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:15,080
l'm Johnny Cage.
And you are?

147
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:17,082
Where's Kano?

148
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,084
l don't know who you're talking about.

149
00:15:21,043 --> 00:15:22,962
But l can help you find him.

150
00:15:23,045 --> 00:15:24,964
Out of my way.

151
00:15:27,299 --> 00:15:29,718
Just another starstruck fan, huh?

152
00:15:53,113 --> 00:15:55,365
l'm honored to finally meet you.

153
00:15:56,241 --> 00:15:58,826
Shang Tsung at your service.

154
00:16:00,494 --> 00:16:03,497
l'm looking for a murderer.
He boarded this ship.

155
00:16:03,581 --> 00:16:06,124
l'm impressed.

156
00:16:06,207 --> 00:16:09,377
But it is my boat,
and if you'd like a tour...

157
00:16:09,461 --> 00:16:12,254
l'd love to give it to you myself.

158
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:15,132
Be nice to the lady.

159
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:16,967
She's doing her job.

160
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:20,136
When l want back-up
l'll radio for it.

161
00:16:27,309 --> 00:16:29,269
Got that radio handy?

162
00:16:34,523 --> 00:16:36,776
Scorpion and Sub-Zero.

163
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,196
The deadliest of enemies...

164
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:42,364
but slaves under my power.

165
00:16:44,866 --> 00:16:45,700
Move aside.

166
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:17,687
- Enough.
- Lord Rayden.

167
00:17:17,728 --> 00:17:21,022
How good of you to grace us
with your...

168
00:17:21,731 --> 00:17:22,899
presence.

169
00:17:25,151 --> 00:17:27,861
Your sideshow freaks
attacked my fighters.

170
00:17:27,903 --> 00:17:31,699
That is expressly forbidden
before the tournament...

171
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,742
as your emperor well knows.

172
00:17:33,825 --> 00:17:36,327
My sincere apologies.

173
00:17:36,411 --> 00:17:38,496
lt won't happen again,
l promise you.

174
00:17:38,579 --> 00:17:40,915
- l shall see to that.
- Of course.

175
00:17:42,249 --> 00:17:44,209
Until we reach the island...

176
00:17:44,251 --> 00:17:46,128
where you have no dominion.

177
00:17:46,211 --> 00:17:48,796
My dominions are well known to me,
sorcerer.

178
00:17:48,879 --> 00:17:51,340
- Thank you.
- What tournament?

179
00:17:53,259 --> 00:17:55,344
You've been chosen, Sonya.

180
00:17:56,761 --> 00:17:59,514
Much to my delight.

181
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:07,021
You really are Rayden.

182
00:18:07,646 --> 00:18:09,231
Come with me.

183
00:18:14,444 --> 00:18:18,281
1 guy with things coming
out of his hand, 1 who freezes stuff...

184
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:21,783
and 1 man who seems to be made
out of electricity.

185
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:25,287
How did he disappear?
What's going on? Who is he?

186
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,371
Let's think this through.

187
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:29,582
There is a rational explanation.

188
00:18:29,665 --> 00:18:34,294
He's Rayden, God of Lightening
and Protector of the Realm of Earth.

189
00:18:34,377 --> 00:18:36,671
- Great.
- There's your rational explanation.

190
00:18:36,755 --> 00:18:38,173
Listen.

191
00:18:39,716 --> 00:18:41,717
What you're about to face is...

192
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,719
vastly more important than...

193
00:18:43,802 --> 00:18:46,055
your ego...

194
00:18:46,138 --> 00:18:47,765
your enemy...

195
00:18:47,806 --> 00:18:51,476
or your quest for revenge.
You have embarked...

196
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:53,937
on a sacred mission.

197
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:57,564
You have been chosen to defend
the Realm of Earth...

198
00:18:57,648 --> 00:19:00,567
in a tournament called Mortal Kombat.

199
00:19:00,651 --> 00:19:02,277
Defend it from who?

200
00:19:03,778 --> 00:19:07,114
Your world is but
one of many realms.

201
00:19:07,198 --> 00:19:10,785
One of them is a forsaken land
called Outworld...

202
00:19:10,826 --> 00:19:14,496
ruled by an immortal
who has crowned himself emperor.

203
00:19:14,579 --> 00:19:18,041
Now he seeks a new world
to conquer and enslave.

204
00:19:18,124 --> 00:19:20,000
Now, wait a second.

205
00:19:20,084 --> 00:19:22,419
lf this guy is so powerful...

206
00:19:22,503 --> 00:19:24,338
why doesn't he invade us?

207
00:19:24,421 --> 00:19:26,547
To enter the Realm of Earth

208
00:19:26,631 --> 00:19:29,300
the Emperor's demon sorcerer,
Shang Tsung...

209
00:19:29,342 --> 00:19:33,470
and his warriors must win 10 straight
victories in Mortal Kombat.

210
00:19:35,305 --> 00:19:37,474
They have won nine.

211
00:19:37,557 --> 00:19:40,560
This will be the tenth.

212
00:19:40,644 --> 00:19:44,689
A handful of people on a leaky boat
are going to save the world?

213
00:19:45,523 --> 00:19:47,108
Exactly.

214
00:19:48,192 --> 00:19:50,986
The essence of Mortal Kombat...

215
00:19:53,405 --> 00:19:55,490
is not about death...

216
00:19:56,282 --> 00:19:58,200
but life.

217
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,495
Mortal men and women...

218
00:20:01,579 --> 00:20:03,454
defending your own world.

219
00:20:03,538 --> 00:20:05,498
Why are you telling me this?

220
00:20:05,582 --> 00:20:07,500
What about the others?

221
00:20:07,584 --> 00:20:09,836
They are all great fighters...

222
00:20:11,128 --> 00:20:13,880
but l have looked
into their souls...

223
00:20:15,173 --> 00:20:17,551
and yours.

224
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:20,261
One of you will decide
the outcome of the tournament.

225
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,515
The fate...

226
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:27,183
of billions will depend upon you.

227
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:31,688
Sorry.

228
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:33,897
What about Shang Tsung?

229
00:20:38,444 --> 00:20:41,738
Oh, still concerned
only with vengeance?

230
00:20:41,779 --> 00:20:44,782
lf you challenge Shang Tsung now...

231
00:20:44,824 --> 00:20:47,160
you'll lose your life and your soul.

232
00:20:47,243 --> 00:20:49,411
He'll pay for my brother's death.

233
00:20:51,121 --> 00:20:53,040
You're not ready.

234
00:20:56,042 --> 00:20:57,084
Look.

235
00:20:58,628 --> 00:21:00,379
lt has begun.

236
00:21:17,353 --> 00:21:19,395
lt has begun.

237
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,712
Black Hawk to Cardinal.

238
00:21:48,796 --> 00:21:52,549
Black Hawk calling Cardinal.
ls anybody monitoring?

239
00:21:55,094 --> 00:21:58,346
Jaxx, this is Sonya.
Do you copy?

240
00:21:58,429 --> 00:22:01,641
While you're at it,
call my agent.

241
00:22:01,683 --> 00:22:03,976
Do l look like your secretary?

242
00:22:31,584 --> 00:22:32,834
What are you doing?

243
00:22:32,917 --> 00:22:36,129
The electrical disturbance
blew out the transistors.

244
00:22:36,212 --> 00:22:38,172
Your radio equipment's fine.

245
00:22:38,214 --> 00:22:40,173
Look at your compass.

246
00:22:46,847 --> 00:22:49,015
Where the hell are we?

247
00:22:49,056 --> 00:22:52,059
- Do l look like your travel agent?
- Fine.

248
00:22:52,143 --> 00:22:53,978
Okay...

249
00:22:54,061 --> 00:22:55,645
l give up.

250
00:22:56,313 --> 00:22:57,606
What's going on?

251
00:22:57,689 --> 00:22:59,399
l don't know.

252
00:23:00,567 --> 00:23:03,027
But what if all the legends
were true?

253
00:23:07,239 --> 00:23:08,824
What legends?

254
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:35,096
Do you need help with those?

255
00:23:44,104 --> 00:23:46,023
Ah, no more steps.

256
00:23:51,152 --> 00:23:54,572
Great! Can't wait
to see the bathrooms.

257
00:24:20,636 --> 00:24:21,762
You know?

258
00:24:22,638 --> 00:24:24,847
When a woman looks at you like that...

259
00:24:24,931 --> 00:24:26,933
it usually means something.

260
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:39,777
Princess Kitana.

261
00:24:39,819 --> 00:24:42,613
She's our most dangerous adversary.

262
00:24:44,657 --> 00:24:46,242
Watch her carefully, Reptile.

263
00:24:46,325 --> 00:24:49,619
Keep her away from these humans.

264
00:26:09,104 --> 00:26:10,481
Welcome.

265
00:26:10,564 --> 00:26:13,067
You're here to compete in...

266
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:14,693
Mortal Kombat.

267
00:26:14,777 --> 00:26:18,738
Tomorrow morning the great
combat begins.

268
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:21,366
Some will have the distinct honor...

269
00:26:21,449 --> 00:26:23,910
and pleasure...

270
00:26:23,952 --> 00:26:27,412
to face Prince Goro...

271
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:29,957
our reigning champion.

272
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:33,834
You are witnesses to a great
turning point in the history...

273
00:26:33,918 --> 00:26:35,836
of your planet.

274
00:26:37,213 --> 00:26:39,130
Treasure these moments...

275
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:42,926
as if they were your last.

276
00:26:44,386 --> 00:26:47,137
Now, for a taste of things to come...

277
00:28:03,537 --> 00:28:06,332
Flawless victory.

278
00:28:13,129 --> 00:28:17,966
"Come to a little tournament," he said.
"Be good for the career," he said.

279
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:19,843
Yeah, right.

280
00:28:19,885 --> 00:28:20,886
Liu.

281
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:25,264
- Where are you going?
- After Shang Tsung.

282
00:28:25,348 --> 00:28:29,310
You can't go after him.
Remember what Rayden said?

283
00:28:29,352 --> 00:28:33,188
He didn't say anything to me.
He knows where Kano's hiding.

284
00:28:34,356 --> 00:28:36,983
You know, you've got to admire her.

285
00:28:37,067 --> 00:28:40,277
When she sets her mind on something...

286
00:28:40,361 --> 00:28:42,613
lt's not her mind you're admiring.

287
00:28:44,907 --> 00:28:46,074
True.

288
00:29:22,231 --> 00:29:26,192
How many times must l tell you?
l don't need your help.

289
00:29:26,276 --> 00:29:28,194
l can take care of myself.

290
00:29:28,278 --> 00:29:31,321
We can't help it.
lt's a guy thing.

291
00:29:31,405 --> 00:29:34,283
- Where are you going?
- l'm following him.

292
00:29:34,366 --> 00:29:37,452
- l work alone.
- No, Shang Tsung is mine.

293
00:29:38,452 --> 00:29:40,246
Let's forget about Shang.

294
00:29:40,329 --> 00:29:42,123
Forget about him?

295
00:29:42,206 --> 00:29:45,709
l want to get to the bottom of this.

296
00:29:45,792 --> 00:29:47,752
Are you out of your mind?

297
00:30:03,933 --> 00:30:05,643
Sonya...

298
00:30:05,727 --> 00:30:08,937
You go ahead. Find out
what that was.

299
00:30:09,021 --> 00:30:11,607
Liu and l'll wait right here.

300
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:12,941
What?

301
00:30:19,238 --> 00:30:22,366
See, me... l believe
in a fair fight.

302
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:24,826
You know, one-on-one,
man-to-man...

303
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:28,288
hand to hand.
Like my daddy taught me.

304
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:31,123
But what l just saw
wasn't very fair.

305
00:30:31,207 --> 00:30:33,417
That's Kano.

306
00:30:33,459 --> 00:30:35,544
Forget about Kano.

307
00:30:35,628 --> 00:30:37,087
Who's the other guy?

308
00:30:37,171 --> 00:30:40,173
Then he freezes this guy, right?

309
00:30:40,256 --> 00:30:44,010
And then he explodes.
l could see his guts and everything.

310
00:30:45,928 --> 00:30:47,346
Almost lost my lunch.

311
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:50,641
Disgusting.

312
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:55,686
What l want to know...
if this Shang Tsung guy's so great...

313
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:58,773
how come he's got such a
crummy looking boat?

314
00:30:59,982 --> 00:31:02,651
Well, anyway, guy gives me the creeps.

315
00:31:02,692 --> 00:31:06,488
"Treasure these moments".

316
00:31:09,365 --> 00:31:12,535
That was his intention.

317
00:31:12,618 --> 00:31:15,870
Shang Tsung is a great sorcerer.

318
00:31:15,954 --> 00:31:18,206
The wise cultivate his favor.

319
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:21,209
Those who challenge his power...

320
00:31:21,292 --> 00:31:23,502
become his slaves.

321
00:31:24,378 --> 00:31:26,088
Yeah?

322
00:31:26,171 --> 00:31:28,257
l haven't seen any of them around.

323
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:30,383
You fool!

324
00:31:30,466 --> 00:31:33,094
You know nothing.

325
00:31:33,177 --> 00:31:35,930
He enslaves souls.

326
00:31:36,013 --> 00:31:40,475
He learned the black arts
from the Emperor himself.

327
00:31:41,476 --> 00:31:43,854
You're some kind of royalty too...

328
00:31:43,895 --> 00:31:46,397
- right?
- l am Goro!

329
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,400
general of the armies
of Outworld and prince...

330
00:31:49,483 --> 00:31:52,735
of the subterranean realm of Shokan.

331
00:31:52,861 --> 00:31:54,863
Subterranean?

332
00:31:54,904 --> 00:31:57,574
What's that,
something like underground?

333
00:31:57,615 --> 00:32:00,076
Yes, something like...

334
00:32:00,117 --> 00:32:01,076
that.

335
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:04,037
l'm kind of an underworld boss.

336
00:32:04,955 --> 00:32:07,623
Well... l mean, back home.

337
00:32:08,583 --> 00:32:10,459
How lucky for them...

338
00:32:10,543 --> 00:32:12,461
"back home".

339
00:32:14,255 --> 00:32:15,797
lt's true...

340
00:32:16,464 --> 00:32:17,924
Prince Goro.

341
00:32:19,467 --> 00:32:24,388
Why else would l have chosen
such a disreputable looking cretin?

342
00:32:25,222 --> 00:32:26,307
Look at him.

343
00:32:27,141 --> 00:32:28,934
No dignity...

344
00:32:29,018 --> 00:32:30,518
no manners.

345
00:32:30,602 --> 00:32:34,522
Yet in the realm of Earth...

346
00:32:34,606 --> 00:32:37,192
such men can amass great wealth...

347
00:32:37,275 --> 00:32:39,610
and almost godlike power.

348
00:32:43,405 --> 00:32:48,117
l'd get back to my amassing
as soon as possible, if you don't mind.

349
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:50,244
Now, when do l get paid?

350
00:32:50,328 --> 00:32:53,788
After you've fought the girl.
But remember...

351
00:32:53,872 --> 00:32:56,958
she's not to be harmed,
only humiliated.

352
00:32:58,293 --> 00:33:00,961
l have plans for my beautiful Sonya.

353
00:33:03,797 --> 00:33:08,259
To what do we owe the honor
of your visit, Shang Tsung?

354
00:33:08,343 --> 00:33:12,972
To warn you Kung Lao's descendant
is competing in the tournament.

355
00:33:13,056 --> 00:33:17,518
- Handle him carefully.
- l saw this Liu Kang in the hall.

356
00:33:17,601 --> 00:33:20,354
He'll pose no problem.

357
00:33:20,437 --> 00:33:23,189
This is no time for
foolish pride.

358
00:33:24,524 --> 00:33:26,859
We've never been
so close to victory.

359
00:33:26,943 --> 00:33:30,195
Which is why l've come
to warn you of another danger.

360
00:33:32,739 --> 00:33:34,533
Princess Kitana.

361
00:33:34,616 --> 00:33:37,493
The Emperor's adopted daughter?

362
00:33:37,535 --> 00:33:39,745
Why should l worry about her?

363
00:33:39,829 --> 00:33:42,998
Princess Kitana
is 10,000 years old...

364
00:33:43,082 --> 00:33:45,750
and the rightful heir to the
throne of Outworld.

365
00:33:45,834 --> 00:33:49,337
She must not join the forces
from the Realm of Earth...

366
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:51,840
especially Liu Kang.

367
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:55,425
What's so special about you?

368
00:33:56,468 --> 00:33:57,719
l don't know.

369
00:33:57,803 --> 00:34:00,221
The Emperor will not
tolerate failure...

370
00:34:01,681 --> 00:34:04,559
and neither will l.

371
00:34:04,642 --> 00:34:07,602
l do not fail.

372
00:34:07,686 --> 00:34:09,604
Let's get out of here.

373
00:34:13,483 --> 00:34:15,693
What? What is it?

374
00:34:15,734 --> 00:34:18,821
We are not alone.

375
00:34:26,244 --> 00:34:28,455
Wait a second,
l don't remember this.

376
00:34:34,877 --> 00:34:35,919
Look!

377
00:34:38,421 --> 00:34:40,631
That has to be Princess Kitana.

378
00:34:40,715 --> 00:34:43,009
She's trying to help us.

379
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:45,385
- You're hard up for a date.
- Come on.

380
00:34:45,427 --> 00:34:47,721
Forget her. She's 10,000 years old.

381
00:34:47,804 --> 00:34:49,848
- So what?
- Liu?

382
00:35:38,306 --> 00:35:41,017
- What happened?
- There's something here.

383
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,186
lt's following Princess Kitana.

384
00:35:43,269 --> 00:35:45,395
Where is she?

385
00:35:45,479 --> 00:35:46,605
l don't know.

386
00:35:53,778 --> 00:35:57,907
- Where are we going?
- l know exactly where we're going.

387
00:35:57,949 --> 00:35:59,908
Kitana went this way.

388
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:05,497
l can smell her perfume.

389
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:08,958
l don't smell anything.

390
00:36:14,295 --> 00:36:15,797
l smell something.

391
00:36:18,925 --> 00:36:20,343
Bullshit.

392
00:36:33,729 --> 00:36:35,148
We got company.

393
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:32,530
Just the way l like them.

394
00:37:32,572 --> 00:37:34,783
Dumb and ugly.

395
00:37:34,866 --> 00:37:37,701
- Piece of cake.
- Piece of cake, huh?

396
00:37:37,785 --> 00:37:40,871
- Well, it was easy for me.
- Get over yourself.

397
00:37:40,954 --> 00:37:43,706
What is it with you guys?

398
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:46,584
We're standing...
they're not.

399
00:37:46,709 --> 00:37:48,628
What more do you want?

400
00:37:56,301 --> 00:38:00,096
Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant.

401
00:38:02,264 --> 00:38:05,810
So, why don't you show me
what you plan to do about...

402
00:38:05,893 --> 00:38:06,935
them?

403
00:38:20,114 --> 00:38:22,073
l don't think so.

404
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:38,796
You'll find that this
is the way out.

405
00:38:49,472 --> 00:38:51,723
You guys are lucky he stopped us.

406
00:39:01,899 --> 00:39:05,653
- So, you've seen what you'll face?
- You mean Goro?

407
00:39:05,736 --> 00:39:08,697
- And Shang Tsung.
- Will he fight in the tournament?

408
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,657
lf he chooses to.

409
00:39:10,699 --> 00:39:13,325
As a former champion
he has the right to do so.

410
00:39:13,409 --> 00:39:17,455
And he's far more dangerous
than Goro.

411
00:39:17,496 --> 00:39:21,583
His power comes from the souls
of vanquished warriors.

412
00:39:21,666 --> 00:39:23,626
To fight Shang Tsung...

413
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:25,712
is to face not one...

414
00:39:25,795 --> 00:39:28,006
but a legion of adversaries.

415
00:39:28,089 --> 00:39:29,715
Remember that.

416
00:39:34,428 --> 00:39:37,013
Tomorrow the tournament begins.

417
00:39:37,972 --> 00:39:39,557
Be prepared.

418
00:39:54,445 --> 00:39:56,322
From this moment on...

419
00:39:56,363 --> 00:39:59,657
my island will be your battleground.

420
00:40:02,327 --> 00:40:03,536
Liu Kang!

421
00:40:03,578 --> 00:40:05,829
You will be first.

422
00:40:05,871 --> 00:40:08,457
Let Mortal Kombat begin.

423
00:40:20,675 --> 00:40:22,094
- Let's go!
- Yes!

424
00:42:15,984 --> 00:42:19,071
Your soul is mine.

425
00:42:32,499 --> 00:42:34,292
Fatality.

426
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:58,521
Sonya Blade!

427
00:43:00,815 --> 00:43:02,858
l have something for you, my dear.

428
00:43:02,942 --> 00:43:05,777
l don't want anything from you.

429
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:08,196
On the contrary.

430
00:43:08,279 --> 00:43:11,991
l have something you want very much.

431
00:43:12,033 --> 00:43:14,159
You can thank me later.

432
00:43:33,635 --> 00:43:35,428
Hello, baby.

433
00:43:35,511 --> 00:43:37,388
Did you miss me?

434
00:43:54,528 --> 00:43:56,572
Now look at this.

435
00:43:56,613 --> 00:43:59,407
This little baby
brings back memories, doesn't it?

436
00:43:59,449 --> 00:44:02,076
You used it to knife your mother
in the back?

437
00:44:03,953 --> 00:44:07,289
lt put a big smile on your
partner, though. Ear...

438
00:44:09,541 --> 00:44:11,126
to ear...

439
00:44:15,963 --> 00:44:18,466
Give it up. l've studied
all your moves.

440
00:44:18,549 --> 00:44:19,591
Study this.

441
00:44:59,334 --> 00:45:01,169
Does it hurt, baby?

442
00:45:20,852 --> 00:45:22,562
Right. Finish him.

443
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:25,816
No, Sonya. Don't!

444
00:45:27,108 --> 00:45:29,443
- Give me a break!
- Okay.

445
00:46:06,183 --> 00:46:07,935
Get over here!

446
00:46:31,122 --> 00:46:32,582
Come here!

447
00:47:38,639 --> 00:47:39,890
Welcome!

448
00:49:28,484 --> 00:49:30,069
Get down here!

449
00:50:52,557 --> 00:50:56,018
"To my Greatest Fan
Johnny Cage"

450
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:48,229
Begin!

451
00:51:57,655 --> 00:52:00,824
Fight with all of your heart
or there is no hope.

452
00:52:00,908 --> 00:52:02,659
Why do you care if l win?

453
00:52:17,713 --> 00:52:21,717
To win your next match,
use the element which brings life.

454
00:52:21,759 --> 00:52:22,843
What?

455
00:52:22,927 --> 00:52:23,970
Kitana!

456
00:52:35,521 --> 00:52:37,773
Remember my words.

457
00:52:37,856 --> 00:52:39,899
That's enough!

458
00:52:41,484 --> 00:52:43,569
You disappoint me.

459
00:52:45,405 --> 00:52:47,115
Not very wise.

460
00:55:31,756 --> 00:55:34,634
Use the element which brings life.

461
00:55:41,307 --> 00:55:42,725
Water.

462
00:56:19,882 --> 00:56:21,383
ls it time?

463
00:56:22,343 --> 00:56:24,344
Yes.

464
00:56:24,427 --> 00:56:26,846
We've let these humans win enough.

465
00:56:28,181 --> 00:56:30,767
At last.

466
00:57:25,313 --> 00:57:26,481
What the...?

467
00:57:39,784 --> 00:57:41,619
Yeah, that's it! ln and out!

468
00:57:52,796 --> 00:57:54,255
Come on. You can do it!

469
00:57:54,297 --> 00:57:55,798
Move! Use your feet.

470
00:57:56,674 --> 00:57:58,009
Kick him!

471
00:58:10,269 --> 00:58:13,105
Come on, Art. Get up!

472
00:58:24,698 --> 00:58:25,657
Get out!

473
00:58:27,075 --> 00:58:28,577
Finish him.

474
00:58:30,245 --> 00:58:31,120
Get out!

475
00:58:41,588 --> 00:58:43,465
Goro! Goro!

476
00:58:43,506 --> 00:58:45,759
Yes! Goro!

477
00:59:04,441 --> 00:59:05,567
Finish him!

478
00:59:09,862 --> 00:59:12,657
Time to die.

479
00:59:12,698 --> 00:59:13,658
Finish him.

480
00:59:52,775 --> 00:59:55,026
Flawless victory.

481
00:59:55,068 --> 00:59:58,738
Your soul is mine!

482
01:00:17,087 --> 01:00:18,672
We can't win!

483
01:00:18,714 --> 01:00:21,842
How can we possibly beat
something like that?

484
01:00:21,925 --> 01:00:24,552
Good question.

485
01:00:24,635 --> 01:00:27,680
Goro can be killed.

486
01:00:27,763 --> 01:00:32,350
Shang Tsung's power can be destroyed
by mortal men and women.

487
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:36,896
You can overcome any adversary...

488
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:40,858
no matter how bizarre
their powers may seem.

489
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:43,694
There is always a way.

490
01:00:44,820 --> 01:00:48,072
Only one thing can defeat you:

491
01:00:48,156 --> 01:00:50,325
Your own fear.

492
01:00:50,408 --> 01:00:52,619
So, who says we're afraid?

493
01:00:54,369 --> 01:00:57,080
You must first face your fears...

494
01:00:57,122 --> 01:01:00,042
if you are to conquer them.

495
01:01:00,083 --> 01:01:03,461
You, Johnny, are afraid
you're a fake...

496
01:01:03,544 --> 01:01:07,632
so you'll rush into any fight
just to prove you're not.

497
01:01:09,758 --> 01:01:11,551
You'll fight...

498
01:01:11,593 --> 01:01:13,470
bravely enough...

499
01:01:13,553 --> 01:01:15,262
but foolishly...

500
01:01:15,346 --> 01:01:17,264
carelessly...

501
01:01:17,348 --> 01:01:19,433
and you'll be beaten.

502
01:01:22,478 --> 01:01:25,271
You, Sonya...

503
01:01:25,313 --> 01:01:29,275
are afraid to admit even you
sometimes need help.

504
01:01:33,737 --> 01:01:36,490
lf you are afraid to trust...

505
01:01:37,324 --> 01:01:39,617
you will lose.

506
01:01:46,498 --> 01:01:47,916
Wait.

507
01:01:48,667 --> 01:01:49,626
Wait.

508
01:01:50,877 --> 01:01:51,962
What about me?

509
01:01:52,045 --> 01:01:54,588
Oh, you.

510
01:01:54,672 --> 01:01:57,341
You fear your own destiny.

511
01:01:57,424 --> 01:02:01,010
You already fled once
when you went to America, so...

512
01:02:01,094 --> 01:02:03,179
you're guilty about Chan's death.

513
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:05,390
l am responsible for Chan's death.

514
01:02:05,473 --> 01:02:09,810
Every mortal is responsible
for his own destiny.

515
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:12,479
Chan believed this.
Why can't you?

516
01:02:14,314 --> 01:02:15,523
l tried.

517
01:02:15,606 --> 01:02:18,359
Despair is the most dangerous fear.

518
01:02:18,442 --> 01:02:20,444
l know this...

519
01:02:20,528 --> 01:02:22,696
and so does Shang Tsung.

520
01:02:22,779 --> 01:02:25,657
He can peer into your soul...

521
01:02:25,699 --> 01:02:28,410
and use the fear he sees against you.

522
01:02:29,327 --> 01:02:31,495
You must be prepared.

523
01:02:55,057 --> 01:02:57,393
Liu!

524
01:02:57,435 --> 01:02:59,978
You will be next.

525
01:03:12,615 --> 01:03:15,491
Goro's never been beaten.

526
01:03:15,575 --> 01:03:17,785
You go up against him,
he'll kill you.

527
01:03:17,869 --> 01:03:19,287
lf l don't...

528
01:03:19,370 --> 01:03:22,123
then he'll finish us off
one at a time.

529
01:03:23,665 --> 01:03:25,584
lf l challenge him now...

530
01:03:26,501 --> 01:03:29,087
l can finish this.

531
01:03:29,171 --> 01:03:32,089
You're making this sound simple
and it isn't.

532
01:03:32,131 --> 01:03:33,758
Yeah, it is.

533
01:03:35,176 --> 01:03:38,887
'Cause l can't let what happened
to Art happen to you.

534
01:03:40,472 --> 01:03:42,974
Not to you.

535
01:03:43,058 --> 01:03:46,810
Oh, don't you dare do this
to protect me, Johnny Cage.

536
01:03:46,894 --> 01:03:49,521
Trust me. l've a plan.

537
01:03:49,605 --> 01:03:52,982
l don't believe this!
You are the most egotistical...

538
01:03:53,066 --> 01:03:55,860
self-deluded person l have ever met.

539
01:03:55,944 --> 01:03:57,904
You forgot "good looking."

540
01:04:04,034 --> 01:04:06,994
Challenging Goro, eh?

541
01:04:07,078 --> 01:04:10,206
You weren't supposed
to fight him now.

542
01:04:10,289 --> 01:04:12,792
Are you that eager to die?

543
01:04:12,875 --> 01:04:14,418
l'm not the one who'll die.

544
01:04:17,796 --> 01:04:19,214
l see.

545
01:04:20,006 --> 01:04:21,716
You're very foolish.

546
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:24,552
The true sign of a hero.

547
01:04:24,635 --> 01:04:26,762
You want to protect your friends.

548
01:04:26,804 --> 01:04:29,430
But make no mistake.

549
01:04:30,473 --> 01:04:32,809
They too will die...

550
01:04:32,850 --> 01:04:35,562
after Goro destroys you.

551
01:04:35,645 --> 01:04:38,105
So what's the problem?

552
01:04:39,147 --> 01:04:41,275
As you wish.

553
01:04:41,316 --> 01:04:45,486
As absurd as your request is,
l shall grant it.

554
01:04:45,570 --> 01:04:50,491
ln return l reserve the right
to challenge the winner myself.

555
01:04:50,575 --> 01:04:53,285
Or another of my choosing.

556
01:04:53,326 --> 01:04:57,289
ln a place designated by me
for the final battle...

557
01:04:57,372 --> 01:04:58,957
of the tournament.

558
01:05:00,416 --> 01:05:03,002
- You got it, pal.
- l don't think so.

559
01:05:07,255 --> 01:05:09,507
Too late, Lord Rayden.

560
01:05:10,508 --> 01:05:12,635
The rules are quite clear.

561
01:05:13,595 --> 01:05:15,512
lt's... How do you say?

562
01:05:16,930 --> 01:05:19,182
"A deal's a deal."

563
01:05:24,729 --> 01:05:26,188
What have you done?

564
01:05:26,272 --> 01:05:28,566
l made a choice.

565
01:05:28,649 --> 01:05:30,984
This is our tournament, remember?

566
01:05:31,026 --> 01:05:32,444
Mortal Kombat.

567
01:05:32,527 --> 01:05:34,446
We fight it.

568
01:05:41,285 --> 01:05:42,912
Good.

569
01:05:42,995 --> 01:05:45,872
At last one of them has understood.

570
01:05:48,541 --> 01:05:51,377
Goro! Goro!

571
01:06:54,765 --> 01:06:57,059
Finish him quickly.

572
01:06:57,101 --> 01:06:58,768
Pay me my tribute.

573
01:06:58,852 --> 01:07:02,397
This puny mortal
will be no problem.

574
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:04,774
l'll crush him in one blow.

575
01:07:04,816 --> 01:07:06,400
Alright.

576
01:07:07,526 --> 01:07:08,694
Let's dance.

577
01:07:18,744 --> 01:07:21,413
Yes! Sorry.

578
01:07:27,294 --> 01:07:28,627
You imbecile.

579
01:07:32,673 --> 01:07:34,717
Damn, that hurt.

580
01:07:35,301 --> 01:07:36,718
Follow him.

581
01:07:36,801 --> 01:07:37,802
Finish him.

582
01:07:43,682 --> 01:07:46,143
- Yes! Yes!
- Goro! Goro!

583
01:07:48,854 --> 01:07:51,147
Finish him! Finish him!

584
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:31,682
Those were $500 sunglasses,
asshole.

585
01:08:51,324 --> 01:08:53,201
This is where you fall down.

586
01:09:08,297 --> 01:09:10,883
Let me go!

587
01:09:11,926 --> 01:09:13,176
Stop!

588
01:09:15,262 --> 01:09:18,890
l hereby exercise my right
to challenge.

589
01:09:18,932 --> 01:09:21,267
l challenge her.

590
01:09:21,350 --> 01:09:23,769
You're a coward, sorcerer.

591
01:09:23,811 --> 01:09:25,271
Stand and fight.

592
01:09:25,312 --> 01:09:27,815
We had a deal, remember?

593
01:09:27,898 --> 01:09:30,859
Mortal Kombat continues.
l'm simply...

594
01:09:30,942 --> 01:09:32,861
changing the place...

595
01:09:34,988 --> 01:09:37,281
as we agreed.

596
01:09:40,117 --> 01:09:42,077
- Sonya!
- Wait!

597
01:09:45,163 --> 01:09:48,541
- Where's he taken her?
- To the Emperor's castle...

598
01:09:48,624 --> 01:09:51,960
in the wastelands of Outworld,
where l cannot follow.

599
01:09:52,043 --> 01:09:53,962
We can.

600
01:09:54,045 --> 01:09:57,757
Rayden...Can Sonya
beat Shang Tsung?

601
01:09:59,466 --> 01:10:00,676
l'm sorry.

602
01:10:00,759 --> 01:10:03,387
- You're sorry.
- There is one last rule.

603
01:10:03,470 --> 01:10:05,722
Neglected to mention it.

604
01:10:05,805 --> 01:10:09,767
She must accept the challenge
or there'll be no final combat.

605
01:10:09,851 --> 01:10:13,812
l have nothing further
to teach you, Liu Kang.

606
01:10:13,896 --> 01:10:15,647
You possess the knowledge.

607
01:10:15,731 --> 01:10:19,359
All that is lacking now is the will.

608
01:10:19,443 --> 01:10:21,611
You sure you don't want to go?

609
01:10:21,694 --> 01:10:24,489
ln Outworld, if you look
hard enough...

610
01:10:24,530 --> 01:10:26,491
you will find another guide.

611
01:10:36,081 --> 01:10:37,374
Good luck.

612
01:10:48,510 --> 01:10:50,220
They'll need it.

613
01:10:53,180 --> 01:10:55,349
This is not good.

614
01:10:55,432 --> 01:10:57,767
But l'm fine.

615
01:10:57,850 --> 01:10:59,936
l can deal with this.

616
01:11:03,272 --> 01:11:06,775
So... this is Outworld.

617
01:11:06,858 --> 01:11:09,611
l can see why they want
a change of scenery.

618
01:11:09,694 --> 01:11:11,780
We should head for that tower.

619
01:11:11,863 --> 01:11:14,114
He'd have taken Sonya there.

620
01:11:34,758 --> 01:11:36,467
l hate this place.

621
01:11:36,551 --> 01:11:39,554
l do. l'm telling you l hate it.

622
01:11:39,637 --> 01:11:42,348
A hostile environment,
l'm unprepared...

623
01:11:42,390 --> 01:11:45,100
with people who want to kick my ass.

624
01:11:45,183 --> 01:11:47,561
lt's like being back in high school!

625
01:11:49,020 --> 01:11:50,771
What's that?

626
01:11:52,273 --> 01:11:53,649
Wait.

627
01:11:54,233 --> 01:11:55,651
What?

628
01:11:56,277 --> 01:11:58,236
There's something else.

629
01:11:58,278 --> 01:11:59,737
Oh, great.

630
01:12:03,950 --> 01:12:05,534
What are you doing?

631
01:12:10,372 --> 01:12:11,623
What are you doing?

632
01:12:42,275 --> 01:12:43,692
Reptile.

633
01:15:43,348 --> 01:15:45,308
Oh no, you don't.

634
01:15:53,357 --> 01:15:54,942
Well done.

635
01:15:57,777 --> 01:16:00,113
You're finally learning, Liu Kang.

636
01:16:00,154 --> 01:16:01,614
Kitana.

637
01:16:02,281 --> 01:16:03,533
Come with me.

638
01:16:06,368 --> 01:16:08,328
What happened here?

639
01:16:09,496 --> 01:16:12,832
The same thing that will happen
to your world...

640
01:16:12,915 --> 01:16:15,000
unless you prevent it.

641
01:16:17,419 --> 01:16:21,339
My father was the rightful ruler
of Outworld

642
01:16:23,299 --> 01:16:26,969
Then his best warriors
lost ten Mortal Kombats...

643
01:16:27,052 --> 01:16:29,596
and the Emperor entered the Realm...

644
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:32,266
killed my parents and adopted me...

645
01:16:32,349 --> 01:16:34,434
to lay claim to the throne.

646
01:16:39,021 --> 01:16:41,149
but it was beautiful once...

647
01:16:41,232 --> 01:16:45,318
before Shang Tsung engineered
its destruction.

648
01:16:45,402 --> 01:16:48,530
How can l stop this from happening
in my world?

649
01:16:48,613 --> 01:16:50,948
lf l did not believe in you...

650
01:16:51,031 --> 01:16:52,867
l would not have helped you.

651
01:16:54,660 --> 01:16:57,871
ln the Black Tower you will face
three challenges.

652
01:16:57,954 --> 01:17:01,583
You must face your enemy.
You must face yourself.

653
01:17:01,666 --> 01:17:04,751
And you must face your worst fear.

654
01:18:20,901 --> 01:18:24,029
l will not fight you, Shang Tsung.

655
01:18:24,113 --> 01:18:26,906
l am not playing your game.

656
01:18:29,534 --> 01:18:30,993
My sweet Sonya.

657
01:18:31,077 --> 01:18:33,037
There's no one else.

658
01:18:33,121 --> 01:18:35,163
lf you don't fight...

659
01:18:35,247 --> 01:18:37,749
the Realm of Earth will
forfeit the Tournament...

660
01:18:38,792 --> 01:18:40,793
and its portals will open...

661
01:18:40,876 --> 01:18:43,629
to our great Emperor.

662
01:18:43,712 --> 01:18:45,464
You're lying.

663
01:18:46,424 --> 01:18:48,299
My friends will come for me.

664
01:18:49,634 --> 01:18:51,469
Hoping against hope.

665
01:18:51,511 --> 01:18:55,722
Such an endearing human trait.
l'm touched. Really.

666
01:18:57,808 --> 01:19:00,185
One last chance, Sonya.

667
01:19:00,269 --> 01:19:02,229
Fight me in Mortal Kombat.

668
01:19:02,312 --> 01:19:04,105
Go to hell.

669
01:19:05,648 --> 01:19:07,442
Take her away.

670
01:19:08,484 --> 01:19:10,777
The Emperor will be overjoyed.

671
01:19:13,822 --> 01:19:15,449
My friends will come.

672
01:19:18,784 --> 01:19:20,119
They're already here.

673
01:19:22,830 --> 01:19:25,832
- Seize them.
- Stay where you are.

674
01:19:27,083 --> 01:19:30,044
Will you dare interfere
with the tournament...

675
01:19:30,128 --> 01:19:32,714
and betray our Emperor?

676
01:19:32,797 --> 01:19:36,258
ln his great wisdom, he knows
that Mortal Kombat...

677
01:19:36,341 --> 01:19:38,260
cannot be won by treachery.

678
01:19:38,343 --> 01:19:41,679
How dare you speak to me
of treachery?

679
01:19:41,721 --> 01:19:45,683
Your ignorance will lose forever...

680
01:19:45,725 --> 01:19:48,059
the keys to the Realm of Earth.

681
01:19:49,102 --> 01:19:50,687
Very well.

682
01:19:55,233 --> 01:19:57,193
l challenge you.

683
01:19:58,861 --> 01:20:00,780
You'll fight me.

684
01:20:06,117 --> 01:20:07,827
l am Liu Kang...

685
01:20:07,911 --> 01:20:10,330
descendant of Kung Lao.

686
01:20:11,246 --> 01:20:14,208
l challenge you to Mortal Kombat.

687
01:20:14,249 --> 01:20:17,086
Do you accept or yield?

688
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:21,214
l accept.

689
01:20:22,590 --> 01:20:24,008
Leave us.

690
01:20:27,219 --> 01:20:29,012
l will take care..

691
01:20:29,096 --> 01:20:32,057
of this impudent mortal myself.

692
01:20:45,777 --> 01:20:47,737
Nice dress.

693
01:21:55,754 --> 01:21:57,672
You fool.

694
01:22:08,515 --> 01:22:10,308
What's that noise?

695
01:22:10,349 --> 01:22:13,394
The source of all
Shang Tsung's power.

696
01:22:13,478 --> 01:22:15,480
The souls of 1000 dead warriors.

697
01:22:22,069 --> 01:22:23,653
Face your enemy.

698
01:23:50,019 --> 01:23:52,188
ls that all you've got, sorcerer?

699
01:23:53,648 --> 01:23:55,232
Liu Kang!

700
01:23:56,608 --> 01:23:59,278
l can see into your soul.

701
01:23:59,361 --> 01:24:02,989
You will die.

702
01:24:06,951 --> 01:24:08,578
Face yourself.

703
01:24:08,661 --> 01:24:12,205
You can look into my soul...

704
01:24:12,289 --> 01:24:14,124
but you don't own it.

705
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:27,886
Face your worst fear.

706
01:24:27,969 --> 01:24:30,305
l'm not afraid of my destiny.

707
01:24:30,346 --> 01:24:31,805
Face me.

708
01:24:36,643 --> 01:24:37,644
Liu.

709
01:24:40,313 --> 01:24:41,397
Chan?

710
01:24:44,484 --> 01:24:45,818
lt can't be you.

711
01:24:48,195 --> 01:24:50,155
Rayden sent me.

712
01:24:50,822 --> 01:24:52,366
To help you.

713
01:24:52,449 --> 01:24:54,325
You're not really Chan.

714
01:24:56,660 --> 01:24:59,038
Remember when our parents died?

715
01:25:02,165 --> 01:25:04,834
You promised you'd always
take care of me?

716
01:25:08,546 --> 01:25:09,797
l remember.

717
01:25:11,548 --> 01:25:13,842
lt's my turn to take care of you.

718
01:25:20,598 --> 01:25:21,849
Come with me.

719
01:25:26,895 --> 01:25:28,480
l forgive you for letting me die.

720
01:25:33,901 --> 01:25:35,486
lt wasn't my fault.

721
01:25:37,947 --> 01:25:39,447
- Brother.
- No.

722
01:25:41,908 --> 01:25:44,035
Chan chose his own path.

723
01:25:45,286 --> 01:25:48,247
Every man is responsible
for his own destiny.

724
01:25:49,707 --> 01:25:51,625
Shang Tsung killed my brother.

725
01:25:53,627 --> 01:25:54,794
You're mine.

726
01:26:21,443 --> 01:26:23,902
The Chosen One.

727
01:26:42,627 --> 01:26:44,838
l am The Chosen One.

728
01:26:53,928 --> 01:26:56,014
You hear your slaves, sorcerer?

729
01:26:59,976 --> 01:27:03,687
You have lost your power over them.
They have risen up against you.

730
01:27:04,563 --> 01:27:06,065
Free them.

731
01:27:07,816 --> 01:27:11,694
They are mine forever.

732
01:27:26,832 --> 01:27:29,794
All those souls,
and you don't have your own.

733
01:27:29,877 --> 01:27:31,586
l pity you, sorcerer.

734
01:27:34,631 --> 01:27:37,509
Save your pity for the weak.

735
01:27:37,550 --> 01:27:38,592
Surrender!

736
01:27:52,188 --> 01:27:54,189
Never!

737
01:28:33,432 --> 01:28:35,600
Flawless victory.

738
01:29:21,432 --> 01:29:22,933
l knew you'd come.

739
01:29:23,850 --> 01:29:25,268
Chan.

740
01:29:28,396 --> 01:29:30,273
One day...

741
01:29:30,315 --> 01:29:32,274
we will be reunited...

742
01:29:34,401 --> 01:29:37,946
but until then my spirit
will always be with you.

743
01:29:40,448 --> 01:29:42,367
Go in peace, my brother.

744
01:30:22,735 --> 01:30:24,820
Let's go home..

745
01:30:46,755 --> 01:30:48,799
l've been waiting for you.

746
01:30:48,882 --> 01:30:51,135
What took you so long?

747
01:30:51,176 --> 01:30:53,886
l guess you knew it would
end this way.

748
01:30:54,679 --> 01:30:56,014
Didn't have a clue.

749
01:30:58,474 --> 01:31:01,268
You humans are so unpredictable.

750
01:31:03,020 --> 01:31:06,481
l must tell you something...
you guys did great.

751
01:31:08,774 --> 01:31:12,486
- Bow to me!
- What is it?

752
01:31:14,030 --> 01:31:15,613
The Emperor.

753
01:31:21,411 --> 01:31:25,372
You weak, pathetic fools.
l've come for your souls.

754
01:31:26,165 --> 01:31:27,708
l don't think so.

755
01:41:12,548 --> 01:41:13,965
Excellent!

756
01:41:16,301 --> 01:41:18,428
Flawless victory!
