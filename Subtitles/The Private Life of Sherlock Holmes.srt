2
00:00:38,064 --> 00:00:41,625
Somewhere in the vaults
of a bank in London...

3
00:00:41,668 --> 00:00:45,365
is a tin dispatch box
with my name on it.

4
00:00:45,405 --> 00:00:50,468
It is not to be opened
until 50 years after my death.

5
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:53,035
It contains certain mementos...

6
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:55,172
of my long association
with a man...

7
00:00:55,215 --> 00:00:59,242
who elevated the science
of deduction to an art...

8
00:00:59,285 --> 00:01:02,186
the world's first,
and, undeniably...

9
00:01:02,222 --> 00:01:06,522
most famous consulting
detective.

10
00:03:27,233 --> 00:03:29,201
To my heirs...

11
00:03:29,235 --> 00:03:30,862
In my lifetime...

12
00:03:30,904 --> 00:03:32,997
I have recorded
some sixty cases...

13
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:35,769
demonstrating the singular gift
of my friend...

14
00:03:35,809 --> 00:03:37,333
Sherlock Holmes...

15
00:03:37,377 --> 00:03:38,639
dealing with everything...

16
00:03:38,678 --> 00:03:41,112
from "The Hound
of the Baskervilles"...

17
00:03:41,147 --> 00:03:42,910
to his mysterious
brother Mycroft...

18
00:03:42,949 --> 00:03:46,385
and the devilish
Professor Moriarty.

19
00:03:46,419 --> 00:03:48,319
But there were
other adventures which...

20
00:03:48,354 --> 00:03:50,288
for reasons of discretion...

21
00:03:50,323 --> 00:03:52,587
I have decided to withhold
from the public...

22
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:54,889
until this much later date.

23
00:03:54,928 --> 00:03:58,830
They involve matters of
a delicate and, sometimes...

24
00:03:58,865 --> 00:04:00,594
scandalous nature...

25
00:04:00,633 --> 00:04:02,464
as will shortly
become apparent.

26
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:08,373
It was August of 1887...

27
00:04:08,408 --> 00:04:10,672
and we were returning
from Yorkshire...

28
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:13,474
where Holmes had solved
the baffling murder...

29
00:04:13,513 --> 00:04:16,073
of Admiral Abernetti.

30
00:04:16,115 --> 00:04:19,209
You may recall that he broke
the murderer's alibi...

31
00:04:19,252 --> 00:04:21,618
by measuring the depth
to which the parsley...

32
00:04:21,654 --> 00:04:25,556
had sunk in the butter
on a hot day.

33
00:04:44,544 --> 00:04:47,035
I wish you'd give me
a bit more warning...

34
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,980
when you come home unexpected.

35
00:04:49,015 --> 00:04:52,314
I'd have roasted a goose,
had a few flowers for you.

36
00:04:52,352 --> 00:04:53,717
My dear Mrs. Hudson...

37
00:04:53,753 --> 00:04:56,654
criminals are as
unpredictable as head colds.

38
00:04:56,689 --> 00:04:58,589
You never quite know when
you're going to catch one.

39
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:00,490
I'll unpack your bags.

40
00:05:00,526 --> 00:05:03,120
Here's an advance copy
of "Strand Magazine."

41
00:05:03,162 --> 00:05:05,426
They've printed
"The Red-headed League."

42
00:05:05,465 --> 00:05:06,762
Very impressive.

43
00:05:06,799 --> 00:05:08,232
Would you like to see
how I've treated it?

44
00:05:08,268 --> 00:05:10,327
I can hardly wait.
I'm sure I shall find out...

45
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:12,167
all sorts
of fascinating things...

46
00:05:12,205 --> 00:05:13,832
about the case
that I never knew before.

47
00:05:13,873 --> 00:05:15,704
Just what do you mean by that?

48
00:05:15,742 --> 00:05:16,834
Oh, come now, Watson.

49
00:05:16,876 --> 00:05:19,504
You must admit you have
a tendency to overromanticize.

50
00:05:19,545 --> 00:05:22,514
You've taken my simple
exercises in logic...

51
00:05:22,548 --> 00:05:24,675
and embellished them,
embroidered them...

52
00:05:24,717 --> 00:05:25,684
exaggerated them.

53
00:05:25,718 --> 00:05:27,015
I deny the accusation.

54
00:05:27,053 --> 00:05:28,543
You've described me as 6'4"...

55
00:05:28,588 --> 00:05:31,182
whereas I am barely 6'1".

56
00:05:31,224 --> 00:05:32,589
A bit of poetic license.

57
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,545
You've saddled me with
this improbable costume...

58
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,152
which the public
now expects me to wear.

59
00:05:36,195 --> 00:05:38,186
That is not my doing.
Blame it on the illustrator.

60
00:05:38,231 --> 00:05:40,859
Made me out to be
a violin virtuoso.

61
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:41,889
There's an invitation...

62
00:05:41,935 --> 00:05:43,935
from the Liverpool Symphony
to appear as soloist...

63
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,403
in "The Mendelssohn Concerto."

64
00:05:45,438 --> 00:05:46,405
Really?

65
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:48,031
The fact is, I could
barely hold my own...

66
00:05:48,074 --> 00:05:50,599
in the pit orchestra
of a second-rate music hall.

67
00:05:50,643 --> 00:05:52,770
You're much too modest.

68
00:05:52,812 --> 00:05:54,746
You have given the reader
the distinct impression...

69
00:05:54,781 --> 00:05:57,306
that I'm a misogynist.

70
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:59,409
Actually,
I don't dislike women.

71
00:05:59,452 --> 00:06:01,784
I merely distrust them.

72
00:06:01,821 --> 00:06:04,688
The twinkle in the eye
and the arsenic in the soup.

73
00:06:04,724 --> 00:06:07,989
It's those little touches
that make you colorful.

74
00:06:08,027 --> 00:06:09,961
Lurid is more like it.

75
00:06:09,996 --> 00:06:12,430
You've painted me
as a hopeless dope addict...

76
00:06:12,465 --> 00:06:15,901
just because I occasionally
take a 5%% solution of cocaine.

77
00:06:15,935 --> 00:06:17,232
A seven percent solution.

78
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:19,170
Five percent.

79
00:06:19,205 --> 00:06:20,900
Don't you think I'm aware
you've been diluting it...

80
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,101
behind my back?

81
00:06:23,142 --> 00:06:25,736
As a doctor,
as well as your friend...

82
00:06:25,778 --> 00:06:27,177
I strongly disapprove...

83
00:06:27,213 --> 00:06:30,046
of this insidious habit
of yours.

84
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:32,745
My dear friend,
as well as my dear doctor...

85
00:06:32,785 --> 00:06:34,412
I only resort to narcotics...

86
00:06:34,454 --> 00:06:36,979
when I'm suffering
from acute boredom...

87
00:06:37,023 --> 00:06:38,115
when there are
no interesting cases...

88
00:06:38,157 --> 00:06:39,454
to engage my mind.

89
00:06:39,492 --> 00:06:40,754
Look at this.

90
00:06:40,793 --> 00:06:43,421
An urgent appeal to find
some missing midgets.

91
00:06:43,463 --> 00:06:44,930
Did you say midgets?

92
00:06:44,964 --> 00:06:47,660
Mmm, six of them.
The Tumbling Piccolos...

93
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,725
an acrobatic act
with some circus.

94
00:06:49,769 --> 00:06:52,897
Disappeared between
London and Bristol.

95
00:06:52,939 --> 00:06:54,531
Well, don't you
find that intriguing?

96
00:06:54,574 --> 00:06:56,235
Extremely so.

97
00:06:56,275 --> 00:06:58,072
You see, they're
not only midgets...

98
00:06:58,111 --> 00:06:59,738
but also anarchists.

99
00:06:59,779 --> 00:07:00,803
Anarchists?

100
00:07:00,847 --> 00:07:02,678
By now they have been
smuggled to Vienna...

101
00:07:02,715 --> 00:07:05,548
dressed as little girls
in organdy pinafores.

102
00:07:05,585 --> 00:07:07,610
They are to greet
the czar of all the Russias...

103
00:07:07,653 --> 00:07:09,587
when he arrives
at the railway station.

104
00:07:09,622 --> 00:07:11,954
They will be carrying
bouquets of flowers...

105
00:07:11,991 --> 00:07:13,822
and concealed
in each bouquet...

106
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,953
will be a bomb with a lit fuse.

107
00:07:17,196 --> 00:07:18,561
You really think so?

108
00:07:18,598 --> 00:07:20,122
Not at all.

109
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:23,499
The circus owner offers me
five pounds for my services.

110
00:07:23,536 --> 00:07:25,197
That's not even
a pound a midget.

111
00:07:25,238 --> 00:07:26,899
So, obviously,
he's a stingy blighter...

112
00:07:26,939 --> 00:07:27,997
and the little chaps
simply ran off...

113
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:29,303
to join another circus.

114
00:07:30,309 --> 00:07:32,300
It sounded so promising.

115
00:07:33,346 --> 00:07:36,042
There are no great crimes
anymore, Watson.

116
00:07:36,082 --> 00:07:38,141
The criminal class
has lost all enterprise...

117
00:07:38,184 --> 00:07:39,344
and originality.

118
00:07:39,385 --> 00:07:42,115
At best, they commit
some bungling villainy...

119
00:07:42,155 --> 00:07:43,850
with a motive so transparent...

120
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:46,518
that even a Scotland Yard
official could see through it.

121
00:07:49,062 --> 00:07:50,586
Mrs. Hudson!

122
00:07:52,799 --> 00:07:54,562
Yes? What is it?

123
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,397
What have I done now?

124
00:07:56,436 --> 00:07:58,597
There is something missing
from my desk.

125
00:07:58,638 --> 00:07:59,605
Missing?

126
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:00,606
Something very crucial.

127
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,607
What?

128
00:08:01,641 --> 00:08:02,767
Dust!

129
00:08:02,809 --> 00:08:06,040
You've been tidying up
against my explicit orders.

130
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:09,207
Oh, look, I made sure
I hadn't disturbed anything.

131
00:08:09,248 --> 00:08:11,546
Dust, Mrs. Hudson,
is an essential part...

132
00:08:11,584 --> 00:08:13,051
of my filing system.

133
00:08:13,086 --> 00:08:14,144
By the thickness of it...

134
00:08:14,187 --> 00:08:15,677
I can date any document
immediately.

135
00:08:15,721 --> 00:08:18,588
Well, some of the dust
was this thick.

136
00:08:19,592 --> 00:08:21,492
That would be...

137
00:08:21,527 --> 00:08:23,256
March 1883.

138
00:08:47,253 --> 00:08:50,586
Oh! How can you stand this?

139
00:08:50,623 --> 00:08:53,421
Why don't you let me
air the room out?

140
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:55,586
Please, Mrs. Hudson,
he's working on...

141
00:08:55,628 --> 00:08:57,619
a definitive study
of tobacco ash.

142
00:08:57,663 --> 00:09:00,325
Oh, I'm sure there's
a crying need for that.

143
00:09:00,366 --> 00:09:02,834
In our endeavors,
it is sometimes vital...

144
00:09:02,869 --> 00:09:04,962
to distinguish
between, say, the ashes...

145
00:09:05,004 --> 00:09:08,235
of a Macedonian cigarette
and a Jamaican cigar.

146
00:09:08,274 --> 00:09:12,233
So far he has classified
140 different kinds of ashes.

147
00:09:12,278 --> 00:09:15,372
All of which will
wind up on my rug.

148
00:09:15,414 --> 00:09:17,780
That will be enough,
Mrs. Hudson.

149
00:09:19,452 --> 00:09:20,714
All right...

150
00:09:20,753 --> 00:09:23,881
if you gentlemen want
to stay and suffocate.

151
00:09:31,697 --> 00:09:34,257
She's right. I am suffocating.

152
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,267
Oh, let me open the window.

153
00:09:35,301 --> 00:09:38,532
Not from lack of air.
From lack of activity.

154
00:09:38,571 --> 00:09:41,039
Sitting here, week after week,
blowing smoke rings...

155
00:09:41,073 --> 00:09:44,304
staring through a microscope...
there's no challenge in that.

156
00:09:44,343 --> 00:09:46,675
Personally, I consider it
a major contribution...

157
00:09:46,712 --> 00:09:48,646
to scientific criminology.

158
00:09:48,681 --> 00:09:50,979
How I envy you
your mind, Watson.

159
00:09:51,017 --> 00:09:51,984
You do?

160
00:09:52,018 --> 00:09:55,510
It's placid,
imperturbable, prosaic.

161
00:09:55,555 --> 00:09:58,456
But my mind rebels
against stagnation.

162
00:09:58,491 --> 00:10:01,051
It's like a racing engine
tearing itself to pieces...

163
00:10:01,093 --> 00:10:02,651
because it's not connected up...

164
00:10:02,695 --> 00:10:04,219
with the work
for which it was built.

165
00:10:59,018 --> 00:11:00,042
Holmes.

166
00:11:07,727 --> 00:11:10,821
Holmes... where's
your self-control?

167
00:11:10,863 --> 00:11:12,023
Fair question.

168
00:11:14,433 --> 00:11:16,025
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

169
00:11:16,068 --> 00:11:18,195
Thoroughly...

170
00:11:18,237 --> 00:11:19,727
but this will take care of it.

171
00:11:34,687 --> 00:11:36,279
There was nothing I could do...

172
00:11:36,322 --> 00:11:38,347
when he went on one of
his cocaine binges...

173
00:11:38,391 --> 00:11:41,326
except hope and pray that
some interesting case...

174
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,419
would come along
to snap him out of it.

175
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:48,157
Why are you being
so stubborn, Holmes?

176
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,633
Why won't you go?

177
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:55,764
It's the final performance of
the Imperial Russian Ballet.

178
00:11:55,808 --> 00:11:57,605
The house has been
sold out for months.

179
00:11:57,643 --> 00:12:00,237
Tickets are going
at a guinea apiece.

180
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:02,270
That's precisely it.

181
00:12:02,315 --> 00:12:04,749
Why should someone
send us two free tickets?

182
00:12:04,784 --> 00:12:05,910
Anonymously, at that.

183
00:12:05,951 --> 00:12:07,748
Well, whoever sent them
must be in great distress.

184
00:12:07,787 --> 00:12:09,084
The note says...

185
00:12:09,121 --> 00:12:12,852
"Please, you are the only man
in the world who can help me."

186
00:12:12,892 --> 00:12:14,985
I suspect
it's some sort of plot.

187
00:12:15,027 --> 00:12:16,927
You mean, somebody wants
to lure us into a trap?

188
00:12:16,962 --> 00:12:18,452
Somebody wants to kill me.

189
00:12:18,497 --> 00:12:19,486
Kill you?

190
00:12:19,532 --> 00:12:20,590
That's right.

191
00:12:20,633 --> 00:12:21,759
It's a plot
to bore me to death.

192
00:12:21,801 --> 00:12:23,132
I detest ballet.

193
00:12:24,136 --> 00:12:27,799
But this isn't just any ballet.

194
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,740
It's "Swan Lake."

195
00:12:50,496 --> 00:12:52,555
You know, of course, Holmes...

196
00:12:52,598 --> 00:12:54,930
that swan isn't really a swan.

197
00:12:54,967 --> 00:12:57,697
It's an enchanted princess.

198
00:12:57,737 --> 00:12:58,931
Mmm.

199
00:13:30,302 --> 00:13:31,667
Fabulous woman.

200
00:13:31,704 --> 00:13:33,171
Don't you think so, Holmes?

201
00:13:33,205 --> 00:13:34,172
Who?

202
00:13:34,206 --> 00:13:35,696
The great Petrova.

203
00:13:49,588 --> 00:13:51,886
Very strong arches,
I must admit.

204
00:13:52,892 --> 00:13:55,588
They say twelve men
have died for her.

205
00:13:55,628 --> 00:13:56,595
Really?

206
00:13:56,629 --> 00:13:58,494
Six committed suicide...

207
00:13:58,531 --> 00:13:59,998
four were killed in duels...

208
00:14:00,032 --> 00:14:01,431
and one fell out
of the gallery...

209
00:14:01,467 --> 00:14:03,560
of the Vienna Opera House.

210
00:14:03,602 --> 00:14:05,092
That's only eleven.

211
00:14:05,137 --> 00:14:07,367
The man who fell
from the gallery...

212
00:14:07,406 --> 00:14:10,432
landed on top of another man
in the orchestra.

213
00:14:10,476 --> 00:14:12,910
That makes an even dozen...

214
00:14:12,945 --> 00:14:14,913
in a messy sort of way.

215
00:14:33,599 --> 00:14:34,759
Mr. Holmes.

216
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,199
Yes?

217
00:14:36,235 --> 00:14:38,032
I am Nikolai Rogozhin...

218
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:40,868
Director General of
the Imperial Russian Ballet.

219
00:14:43,909 --> 00:14:46,207
So glad you accept invitation.

220
00:14:46,245 --> 00:14:47,337
This is Dr. Watson.

221
00:14:47,379 --> 00:14:49,040
Nice to meet you.

222
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,218
You're enjoying?

223
00:14:53,252 --> 00:14:54,480
Immensely.

224
00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:00,217
Tell me, Mr. Holmes...

225
00:15:00,259 --> 00:15:02,056
how is your health?

226
00:15:02,094 --> 00:15:03,391
My health?

227
00:15:03,429 --> 00:15:05,090
Better consult my doctor.

228
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:06,791
Oh, he's in excellent shape.

229
00:15:09,368 --> 00:15:12,496
Any insanity in your family?
Diabetes? Asthma?

230
00:15:12,538 --> 00:15:15,006
Would you mind telling me
what this is all about?

231
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,439
Certainly.

232
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,802
Madame Petrova...

233
00:15:20,813 --> 00:15:22,906
she has problem.

234
00:15:22,948 --> 00:15:24,609
Can you be more specific?

235
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,845
Certainly not.

236
00:15:26,886 --> 00:15:28,854
Liaison with a crowned head?

237
00:15:28,888 --> 00:15:31,083
Compromising letters? Blackmail?

238
00:15:42,735 --> 00:15:43,793
After performance...

239
00:15:43,836 --> 00:15:46,999
there will be little
celebration backstage...

240
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:49,030
and Madame requests
your presence.

241
00:15:49,074 --> 00:15:50,871
We'd be delighted.

242
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:53,037
You are invited, also.

243
00:16:03,956 --> 00:16:05,116
Hey!

244
00:16:20,906 --> 00:16:23,932
Ah, Mr. Holmes...

245
00:16:23,976 --> 00:16:25,910
Madame is expecting you
in her dressing room.

246
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,246
Dr. Watson, you will
amuse yourself meanwhile.

247
00:16:30,282 --> 00:16:32,648
We have vodka, caviar, girls.

248
00:16:32,685 --> 00:16:33,709
Oh, no, thank you.

249
00:16:33,752 --> 00:16:34,741
No girls?

250
00:16:34,787 --> 00:16:37,278
No caviar.
It makes me break out in hives.

251
00:16:42,661 --> 00:16:44,629
Doctor Watson.

252
00:16:49,702 --> 00:16:52,637
Any of your girls
understand English?

253
00:16:52,671 --> 00:16:54,639
Nyet!

254
00:16:54,673 --> 00:16:55,867
Well, now, not one single word?

255
00:16:55,908 --> 00:16:57,273
Nyet!

256
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:00,374
In that case,
I don't mind telling you...

257
00:17:00,412 --> 00:17:03,848
that you all have
lovely pooh-poohs.

258
00:17:08,654 --> 00:17:10,554
Mr. Holmes,
I must prepare you.

259
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:12,784
This is not ordinary case.

260
00:17:12,825 --> 00:17:16,056
It's only the extraordinary
that interests me.

261
00:17:16,095 --> 00:17:17,187
Good.

262
00:17:17,229 --> 00:17:22,257
Because you'll find this
extra-extraordinary.

263
00:17:25,704 --> 00:17:27,103
Madame Petrova...

264
00:17:33,379 --> 00:17:35,404
Mr. Sherlock Holmes...

265
00:17:35,447 --> 00:17:39,247
may I present Madame Petrova.

266
00:17:45,891 --> 00:17:48,189
Ochen priatna.

267
00:17:51,897 --> 00:17:53,330
Madame.

268
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:01,437
Madame says you are
shorter than she thought.

269
00:18:01,473 --> 00:18:02,770
Oh, I didn't mean to be.

270
00:18:08,013 --> 00:18:09,310
Short, tall, who cares?

271
00:18:09,348 --> 00:18:11,077
It is the brains that count.

272
00:18:11,116 --> 00:18:12,447
Well, thank you.

273
00:18:12,484 --> 00:18:13,678
Thank you.

274
00:18:18,357 --> 00:18:20,052
Baskervilles.

275
00:18:20,092 --> 00:18:22,185
Madame is great
admirer of yours.

276
00:18:22,227 --> 00:18:23,888
She has read every story.

277
00:18:23,929 --> 00:18:25,920
Her favorite is...

278
00:18:25,964 --> 00:18:29,058
"Big Dog from Baskervilles."

279
00:18:29,101 --> 00:18:31,763
I'm afraid it loses
something in translation.

280
00:18:31,804 --> 00:18:32,896
Nikolai...

281
00:18:35,941 --> 00:18:38,967
Mr. Holmes,
you know about fiddles?

282
00:18:44,049 --> 00:18:46,176
What is your opinion of this?

283
00:18:50,222 --> 00:18:55,489
"Antonius Stradivarius,
Cremonensis...

284
00:18:55,527 --> 00:18:57,961
"Anno 1709."

285
00:18:58,964 --> 00:19:00,795
Well, the label is authentic.

286
00:19:04,636 --> 00:19:07,070
Judging from the shape,
the color of the varnish...

287
00:19:07,106 --> 00:19:09,802
and the tone, I would say
it is a genuine Stradivarius...

288
00:19:09,842 --> 00:19:11,002
of the best period.

289
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:13,705
You like?

290
00:19:13,746 --> 00:19:15,008
Oh, it's magnificent.

291
00:19:15,047 --> 00:19:16,036
Nikolai...

292
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:23,081
Here. Take it.

293
00:19:24,156 --> 00:19:25,521
Madame says it is yours.

294
00:19:25,557 --> 00:19:26,524
Mine?

295
00:19:26,558 --> 00:19:29,083
For services you will render.

296
00:19:29,128 --> 00:19:31,858
My fees as a detective
are not exactly trifling...

297
00:19:31,897 --> 00:19:33,990
but a Stradivarius...
you're not serious.

298
00:19:34,032 --> 00:19:37,092
I am not, but Madame is.

299
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:48,871
All right...

300
00:19:48,914 --> 00:19:50,905
I will pour vodka and explain.

301
00:19:52,718 --> 00:19:54,777
Mr. Holmes...

302
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:58,256
what you have seen
tonight is last...

303
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:00,281
and positively
final performance...

304
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:02,156
of Madame Petrova.

305
00:20:02,194 --> 00:20:03,161
She is retiring.

306
00:20:03,195 --> 00:20:04,856
What a shame.

307
00:20:04,897 --> 00:20:06,694
She's been dancing since
she was three years old...

308
00:20:06,732 --> 00:20:09,064
and after all,
she is now thirty-eight.

309
00:20:09,101 --> 00:20:11,194
I must say,
she doesn't look thirty-eight.

310
00:20:11,236 --> 00:20:14,637
That is because
she is forty-nine.

311
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:18,199
So Madame has decided
to leave ballet...

312
00:20:18,243 --> 00:20:20,234
and spend life
bringing up her child.

313
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:21,473
How admirable.

314
00:20:21,513 --> 00:20:23,481
Problem is how to find father.

315
00:20:23,515 --> 00:20:24,812
Oh, is he missing?

316
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:25,817
Correct.

317
00:20:25,851 --> 00:20:27,212
And that's why
you've called me in.

318
00:20:27,219 --> 00:20:28,652
Also correct.

319
00:20:28,687 --> 00:20:29,654
We must have father.

320
00:20:29,688 --> 00:20:32,555
Because without father,
how could there be child?

321
00:20:32,591 --> 00:20:33,888
Oh, I see.

322
00:20:33,926 --> 00:20:37,919
The whole thing is still
in the planning stage.

323
00:20:37,963 --> 00:20:38,930
Correct again.

324
00:20:38,964 --> 00:20:40,329
Madame would like child...

325
00:20:40,365 --> 00:20:42,890
to be brilliant and beautiful.

326
00:20:42,935 --> 00:20:46,029
Since she is beautiful,
she needs man who is brilliant.

327
00:20:46,071 --> 00:20:48,005
Zo sdarovya!

328
00:20:55,047 --> 00:20:56,241
What's in it?

329
00:20:56,281 --> 00:20:57,248
What does it taste like?

330
00:20:57,282 --> 00:20:58,271
Red pepper.

331
00:20:58,317 --> 00:20:59,477
That's what's in it.

332
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,112
I beg your pardon?

333
00:21:03,155 --> 00:21:05,035
Madame would like to know
when you can be ready.

334
00:21:05,057 --> 00:21:06,684
- Ready?
- To leave for Venice.

335
00:21:06,725 --> 00:21:08,022
All the arrangements
have been made.

336
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,960
You will spend
one week there with Madame...

337
00:21:09,995 --> 00:21:10,962
This is all very flattering...

338
00:21:10,996 --> 00:21:12,486
but surely
there are other men...

339
00:21:12,531 --> 00:21:13,498
better men.

340
00:21:13,532 --> 00:21:14,499
To tell truth...

341
00:21:14,533 --> 00:21:16,160
you were not the first choice.

342
00:21:16,201 --> 00:21:18,533
We considered
Russian writer... Tolstoy.

343
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:20,595
Oh, that's more like it.
The man's a genius.

344
00:21:20,639 --> 00:21:21,765
Too old.

345
00:21:21,807 --> 00:21:24,640
Then we considered
philosopher... Nietzsche.

346
00:21:24,676 --> 00:21:26,143
Well, absolutely
first-rate mind.

347
00:21:26,178 --> 00:21:27,440
Uh-uh, too German.

348
00:21:27,479 --> 00:21:29,879
Then we considered Tchaikovsky.

349
00:21:29,915 --> 00:21:31,883
Oh, you couldn't go
wrong with Tchaikovsky.

350
00:21:31,917 --> 00:21:34,545
We could, and we did.

351
00:21:34,586 --> 00:21:37,146
It was catastrophe.

352
00:21:37,189 --> 00:21:38,156
Why?

353
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:40,158
We don't know.

354
00:21:40,192 --> 00:21:43,161
Because Tchaikovsky...

355
00:21:43,195 --> 00:21:44,355
how shall I put it?

356
00:21:46,465 --> 00:21:49,730
Women... not his glass of tea.

357
00:21:51,003 --> 00:21:52,470
Oh, pity, that.

358
00:21:57,542 --> 00:22:00,170
Madame is very happy
with her final choice.

359
00:22:00,212 --> 00:22:01,941
Madame must not be too hasty.

360
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,914
She must remember
that I am an Englishman.

361
00:22:03,949 --> 00:22:04,916
So?

362
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:05,917
You know what
they say about us.

363
00:22:05,951 --> 00:22:07,213
If there's one thing
more deplorable...

364
00:22:07,252 --> 00:22:09,186
than our cooking,
it's our lovemaking.

365
00:22:09,221 --> 00:22:11,815
We are not the most
romantic of people.

366
00:22:11,857 --> 00:22:12,824
Perfect.

367
00:22:12,858 --> 00:22:14,792
We don't want
sentimental idiots...

368
00:22:14,826 --> 00:22:18,557
falling in love,
committing suicide.

369
00:22:18,597 --> 00:22:20,394
One week in Venice
with Madame...

370
00:22:20,432 --> 00:22:22,457
she goes back to
St. Petersburg with baby...

371
00:22:22,501 --> 00:22:25,561
you go back to London
with fiddle.

372
00:22:26,805 --> 00:22:28,534
An equitable arrangement.

373
00:22:29,908 --> 00:22:32,172
About my medical history...

374
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:33,837
when you asked me,
I neglected to mention...

375
00:22:33,879 --> 00:22:35,506
one small detail.

376
00:22:35,547 --> 00:22:37,538
There is hemophilia
in my family.

377
00:22:37,582 --> 00:22:38,549
Huh?

378
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:40,608
We're all bleeders.

379
00:22:49,094 --> 00:22:51,824
Madame says not to worry,
she will not scratch you.

380
00:22:51,863 --> 00:22:53,763
Well, that's reassuring
to know, but there...

381
00:22:57,235 --> 00:22:59,032
Madame says you talk too much.

382
00:22:59,071 --> 00:23:02,438
You find her attractive or no?

383
00:23:02,474 --> 00:23:04,442
Well, I...

384
00:23:04,476 --> 00:23:05,443
Oh, excuse me.

385
00:23:05,477 --> 00:23:08,071
What does "prokyzhynik" mean?

386
00:23:08,113 --> 00:23:11,048
It means you little devil.

387
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:13,847
It does? I am? Thank you.

388
00:23:13,885 --> 00:23:15,147
I repeat question.

389
00:23:17,489 --> 00:23:20,549
You find Madame
attractive or no?

390
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:24,495
Oh, I find her
most attractive...

391
00:23:25,564 --> 00:23:27,191
for a woman, that is.

392
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,699
Then no problem.

393
00:23:28,734 --> 00:23:30,861
Maybe a slight one.

394
00:23:30,902 --> 00:23:32,802
You see, I am not a free man.

395
00:23:33,605 --> 00:23:35,197
Not free?

396
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,468
But you are bachelor.

397
00:23:36,508 --> 00:23:39,739
A bachelor living
with another bachelor...

398
00:23:39,778 --> 00:23:41,678
for the last five years.

399
00:23:43,482 --> 00:23:45,916
Five very happy years.

400
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:51,014
What is it you are
trying to tell us?

401
00:23:51,056 --> 00:23:53,115
Well, I hoped I could
avoid the subject...

402
00:23:53,158 --> 00:23:56,787
but some of us,
through a cruel...

403
00:23:56,828 --> 00:23:58,193
caprice of Mother Nature...

404
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:59,822
Get to point.

405
00:23:59,865 --> 00:24:01,696
The point is
that Tchaikovsky...

406
00:24:01,733 --> 00:24:03,894
is not an isolated case.

407
00:24:03,935 --> 00:24:06,665
You mean you
and Dr. Watson...

408
00:24:08,807 --> 00:24:12,573
He... is your glass of tea?

409
00:24:12,611 --> 00:24:14,670
If you want to be
picturesque about it.

410
00:24:22,687 --> 00:24:24,314
Tchaikovsky?

411
00:24:41,273 --> 00:24:44,299
Believe me, Madame,
the loss is all mine.

412
00:24:45,143 --> 00:24:47,134
But I would rather
disappoint you now...

413
00:24:47,179 --> 00:24:49,739
than disappoint you
in a gondola in Venice.

414
00:24:51,516 --> 00:24:54,542
It would have been...
catastrophe!

415
00:25:15,207 --> 00:25:16,174
Watson.

416
00:25:16,208 --> 00:25:17,175
Watson, are you coming?

417
00:25:17,209 --> 00:25:18,176
What is it, old boy?

418
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:19,177
We're going home.

419
00:25:19,211 --> 00:25:22,806
Home? Not a chance.

420
00:25:22,848 --> 00:25:25,817
Not the slightest,
not the remotest chance.

421
00:25:25,851 --> 00:25:27,011
Toodle-oo!

422
00:25:37,295 --> 00:25:38,557
Hey!

423
00:27:48,893 --> 00:27:50,121
Good luck.

424
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:54,425
Just one moment.

425
00:28:00,238 --> 00:28:02,365
What's going on?

426
00:28:03,908 --> 00:28:05,432
What happened to the girls?

427
00:28:05,477 --> 00:28:07,843
Why, do you not
prefer it this way?

428
00:28:07,879 --> 00:28:09,005
What way?

429
00:28:09,047 --> 00:28:11,015
Oh, you don't have to pretend.

430
00:28:11,049 --> 00:28:13,279
Mr. Holmes
told us everything...

431
00:28:13,318 --> 00:28:14,945
about you and him.

432
00:28:14,986 --> 00:28:17,079
About me and him?

433
00:28:17,122 --> 00:28:19,386
Come on.
No need to be bashful.

434
00:28:19,424 --> 00:28:21,551
We are not bourgeois.

435
00:28:21,593 --> 00:28:24,460
Maybe between doctors
and detectives...

436
00:28:24,496 --> 00:28:26,464
is unusual, but...

437
00:28:26,498 --> 00:28:29,467
in ballet, is very usual.

438
00:28:29,501 --> 00:28:31,526
What is?

439
00:28:31,569 --> 00:28:35,335
Caprice of Mother Nature.

440
00:28:35,373 --> 00:28:38,865
Look, Cahvel and Misha...

441
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:44,075
Boris and Demitri,
and llya and Sergei.

442
00:28:44,115 --> 00:28:47,642
Sergei... half and half.

443
00:29:24,189 --> 00:29:25,349
Holmes!

444
00:29:32,864 --> 00:29:34,195
Holmes!

445
00:29:38,203 --> 00:29:39,830
There you are.

446
00:29:39,871 --> 00:29:44,035
You wretch! You rotter!

447
00:29:44,075 --> 00:29:45,633
You blackguard!

448
00:29:45,677 --> 00:29:49,169
Of all the vile,
unspeakable fabrications!

449
00:29:49,214 --> 00:29:52,615
What do you have to say
for yourself?

450
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:54,948
Well, don't just sit there!

451
00:29:54,986 --> 00:29:56,146
Speak up, man!

452
00:30:04,696 --> 00:30:06,288
Holmes?

453
00:30:10,235 --> 00:30:11,532
Are you all right, Holmes?

454
00:30:13,505 --> 00:30:14,733
Holmes?

455
00:30:29,421 --> 00:30:30,854
From the sound
of your footsteps...

456
00:30:30,889 --> 00:30:34,154
I gathered that you were not
in a particularly amiable mood.

457
00:30:36,261 --> 00:30:39,594
How... how could you...

458
00:30:39,631 --> 00:30:42,395
invent such a dastardly lie?

459
00:30:42,434 --> 00:30:44,800
What the deuce
were you thinking of?

460
00:30:49,007 --> 00:30:53,068
Watson, you have
my most abject apologies.

461
00:30:53,111 --> 00:30:55,671
But have you ever been
cornered by a madwoman?

462
00:30:55,713 --> 00:30:57,578
It seemed like the only
way to get out of it...

463
00:30:57,615 --> 00:30:59,776
without hurting her feelings.

464
00:30:59,818 --> 00:31:01,581
And what about my feelings...

465
00:31:01,619 --> 00:31:03,246
and my reputation?

466
00:31:03,288 --> 00:31:05,756
You realize the gravity
of what you've done...

467
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:06,984
the possible repercussions?

468
00:31:07,025 --> 00:31:08,424
So there'll be a little
gossip about you...

469
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,518
in St. Petersburg.

470
00:31:09,561 --> 00:31:11,688
These things spread
like wildfire.

471
00:31:11,729 --> 00:31:14,357
I can just hear
those malicious whispers...

472
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:15,696
behind my back.

473
00:31:15,733 --> 00:31:18,361
I'll never be able to show
my face in polite society.

474
00:31:18,403 --> 00:31:21,201
And if it ever got back
to my old regiment...

475
00:31:21,239 --> 00:31:24,675
you don't know the Fifth
Northumberland Fusioneers.

476
00:31:24,709 --> 00:31:26,939
They'll strike me
off the rolls.

477
00:31:26,978 --> 00:31:28,639
They'll cut off my pension!

478
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,648
Watson, you're running amuck.

479
00:31:30,682 --> 00:31:34,083
Dishonored, disgraced,
ostracized...

480
00:31:36,254 --> 00:31:37,516
What am I to do?

481
00:31:38,389 --> 00:31:40,914
Well, for one thing,
I'd get rid of that flower.

482
00:31:45,597 --> 00:31:47,394
Oh, you may think
this is funny...

483
00:31:47,432 --> 00:31:49,229
but we're both
in the same boat.

484
00:31:49,267 --> 00:31:51,462
We must take
desperate measures.

485
00:31:51,503 --> 00:31:53,630
We must stop this talk!

486
00:31:55,306 --> 00:31:57,240
Maybe if we got married.

487
00:31:57,275 --> 00:31:59,505
Then they'd really talk.

488
00:32:02,113 --> 00:32:03,910
Obviously,
we cannot continue...

489
00:32:03,948 --> 00:32:05,916
to live under the same roof.

490
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:07,679
We must move apart.

491
00:32:07,719 --> 00:32:09,016
Of course...

492
00:32:09,053 --> 00:32:11,180
we can still see each
other clandestinely...

493
00:32:11,222 --> 00:32:13,190
on remote benches
in Hyde Park...

494
00:32:13,224 --> 00:32:15,055
and in the waiting rooms...

495
00:32:15,093 --> 00:32:17,561
of suburban railway stations.

496
00:32:17,595 --> 00:32:19,722
This whole thing's ridiculous.

497
00:32:19,764 --> 00:32:22,028
We have nothing to hide.

498
00:32:22,066 --> 00:32:23,533
That's what I've been
trying to tell you.

499
00:32:23,568 --> 00:32:26,230
Let somebody start a rumor,
just one ugly word.

500
00:32:26,271 --> 00:32:27,704
We'll sue them for slander.

501
00:32:27,739 --> 00:32:29,036
No one would dare.

502
00:32:29,073 --> 00:32:31,701
After all, you have an enviable
record with the fair sex.

503
00:32:31,743 --> 00:32:32,710
Damn right.

504
00:32:32,744 --> 00:32:34,871
I can get women
from three continents...

505
00:32:34,913 --> 00:32:36,039
to testify for me...

506
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,638
and you can get women
to vouch for you, too...

507
00:32:37,682 --> 00:32:39,047
can't you, Holmes?

508
00:32:46,424 --> 00:32:48,016
Can you, Holmes?

509
00:32:49,928 --> 00:32:51,156
Good night, Watson.

510
00:32:53,264 --> 00:32:54,424
Holmes.

511
00:32:56,467 --> 00:32:58,162
Let me ask you a question.

512
00:32:58,202 --> 00:33:00,898
I hope I'm not
being presumptuous...

513
00:33:00,939 --> 00:33:03,635
but there have been
women in your life?

514
00:33:03,675 --> 00:33:06,371
The answer is yes...

515
00:33:08,646 --> 00:33:11,376
you're being presumptuous.

516
00:33:16,554 --> 00:33:17,748
Good night.

517
00:33:20,558 --> 00:33:21,889
Holmes.

518
00:33:32,003 --> 00:33:35,962
What indeed was
his attitude towards women?

519
00:33:36,007 --> 00:33:39,067
Was there some secret
he was holding back...

520
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:41,670
or was he just
a thinking machine...

521
00:33:41,713 --> 00:33:43,977
incapable of any emotion?

522
00:33:44,015 --> 00:33:45,915
I was not to get the answer...

523
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:48,578
until we became involved
in what I considered to be...

524
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:52,613
the most outrageous case
in all our years together.

525
00:34:20,585 --> 00:34:22,246
Were you expecting someone?

526
00:34:22,286 --> 00:34:23,480
Not at this hour.

527
00:34:26,924 --> 00:34:29,256
Maybe Mrs. Hudson
is entertaining.

528
00:34:29,293 --> 00:34:31,124
I never found her so.

529
00:34:39,404 --> 00:34:40,393
I don't know nothing about it.

530
00:34:40,438 --> 00:34:42,668
Then I'd like
to speak to the master.

531
00:34:42,707 --> 00:34:43,867
Well, I think he's in bed.

532
00:34:43,908 --> 00:34:45,205
It's important.

533
00:34:45,243 --> 00:34:46,642
What is it, Mrs. Hudson?

534
00:34:46,678 --> 00:34:49,738
There's a cabby here,
says you owe him two and six.

535
00:34:49,781 --> 00:34:51,078
For what?

536
00:34:51,115 --> 00:34:52,742
For the fare, governor.

537
00:34:52,784 --> 00:34:54,843
The young lady
don't have no money.

538
00:34:54,886 --> 00:34:56,148
What young lady?

539
00:34:56,187 --> 00:34:57,552
This one.

540
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:09,258
Well, what have we here?

541
00:35:10,802 --> 00:35:12,133
Who are you, miss?

542
00:35:14,272 --> 00:35:15,830
What happened to you?

543
00:35:26,451 --> 00:35:27,941
I don't know.

544
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,815
That's all she keeps saying:

545
00:35:30,855 --> 00:35:32,789
"I don't know. I don't know."

546
00:35:36,761 --> 00:35:37,955
Where did she come from?

547
00:35:37,995 --> 00:35:39,257
From the river.

548
00:35:39,297 --> 00:35:40,764
I was driving down
the embankment...

549
00:35:40,798 --> 00:35:42,425
just below
Westminster Bridge...

550
00:35:42,467 --> 00:35:45,698
and there she was
in the water, drowning.

551
00:35:45,737 --> 00:35:47,534
Wasn't easy, governor...

552
00:35:47,572 --> 00:35:51,599
what with the cold water
and her fighting me.

553
00:35:51,642 --> 00:35:53,576
Why did you bring her here?

554
00:35:53,611 --> 00:35:58,548
Because I found
this in her hand.

555
00:35:58,583 --> 00:36:01,108
"221-B Baker Street."

556
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:02,642
That's right, isn't it?

557
00:36:02,687 --> 00:36:05,383
Young lady, what did
you want at this address?

558
00:36:08,259 --> 00:36:10,159
I do not remember.

559
00:36:11,896 --> 00:36:13,989
Rather perplexing,
wouldn't you say?

560
00:36:14,599 --> 00:36:16,157
Rather.

561
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,224
Well, gentlemen...

562
00:36:17,268 --> 00:36:19,896
you want her, it's two and six.

563
00:36:19,937 --> 00:36:22,405
Or shall I throw her
back in the river?

564
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:25,170
Oh, Mr. Holmes,
you can't let him do that.

565
00:36:25,209 --> 00:36:26,904
Watson, you better
accept delivery.

566
00:36:29,447 --> 00:36:30,471
Keep the change.

567
00:36:30,515 --> 00:36:31,914
Thank you, governor.

568
00:36:35,453 --> 00:36:38,547
No extra charge for the use
of the horse blanket.

569
00:36:40,625 --> 00:36:42,525
You're shivering, my dear.

570
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,527
Come along...

571
00:36:43,561 --> 00:36:45,122
let me get you out
of those wet clothes.

572
00:37:18,429 --> 00:37:19,862
Sit here, my dear.

573
00:37:29,674 --> 00:37:32,234
She's suffering from
shock and exposure.

574
00:37:44,689 --> 00:37:46,122
There was some printing
on the back of this...

575
00:37:46,157 --> 00:37:48,148
but it seems to have
come off in the water.

576
00:37:50,261 --> 00:37:51,285
Look at this.

577
00:37:51,329 --> 00:37:53,593
She's had a nasty
blow on the head.

578
00:37:53,631 --> 00:37:55,724
Could she have hit
her head when she fell...

579
00:37:55,766 --> 00:37:56,766
or jumped into the river?

580
00:37:58,502 --> 00:38:01,096
No. The blood had
already coagulated.

581
00:38:01,138 --> 00:38:03,129
So, it would appear
that she was the victim...

582
00:38:03,174 --> 00:38:04,937
of a deliberate attack.

583
00:38:04,976 --> 00:38:06,466
Get my bag, will you?

584
00:38:11,749 --> 00:38:13,444
Who are you?

585
00:38:13,484 --> 00:38:15,714
I'm Dr. Watson...

586
00:38:15,753 --> 00:38:17,584
and this is Sherlock Holmes.

587
00:38:17,622 --> 00:38:19,419
Oh.

588
00:38:19,457 --> 00:38:21,891
Do the names mean
anything to you?

589
00:38:21,926 --> 00:38:23,723
No.

590
00:38:23,761 --> 00:38:25,160
Think.

591
00:38:27,164 --> 00:38:28,893
I'm trying.

592
00:38:28,933 --> 00:38:30,662
Can you think of your own name?

593
00:38:33,104 --> 00:38:34,571
No.

594
00:38:34,605 --> 00:38:36,698
She's obviously
had a concussion...

595
00:38:36,741 --> 00:38:38,902
which often leads
to temporary amnesia.

596
00:38:38,943 --> 00:38:39,910
So, all we know...

597
00:38:39,944 --> 00:38:41,411
is that she was
coshed on the head...

598
00:38:41,445 --> 00:38:42,445
dumped into the Thames...

599
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,948
and subsequently
dumped into our laps.

600
00:38:44,982 --> 00:38:46,677
We know a lot more than that.

601
00:38:46,717 --> 00:38:48,776
From her accent,
we know she's foreign.

602
00:38:48,819 --> 00:38:50,582
From her ring,
we know she's married.

603
00:38:50,621 --> 00:38:52,418
There's one other clue we have.

604
00:38:52,456 --> 00:38:53,423
Namely?

605
00:38:53,457 --> 00:38:54,515
Something I deduced...

606
00:38:54,558 --> 00:38:56,150
when I was helping
her up the stairs.

607
00:38:57,528 --> 00:38:58,756
No corset.

608
00:39:01,465 --> 00:39:02,762
Good work.

609
00:39:06,704 --> 00:39:09,605
"La Femme Elegant."

610
00:39:11,242 --> 00:39:13,369
Are you French?

611
00:39:13,411 --> 00:39:15,572
Vous etes francaise?

612
00:39:17,415 --> 00:39:18,905
Non.

613
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:21,043
Je ne suis pas francaise.

614
00:39:22,019 --> 00:39:23,646
How can she say
she's not French...

615
00:39:23,688 --> 00:39:24,712
in French?

616
00:39:24,755 --> 00:39:26,586
Vous etes suisse?

617
00:39:27,692 --> 00:39:28,886
Non.

618
00:39:28,926 --> 00:39:31,258
Alors, vous etes belge?

619
00:39:33,664 --> 00:39:35,632
Je ne suis pas sur.

620
00:39:42,573 --> 00:39:45,667
Vous etes belge, de Bruxelles?

621
00:39:47,445 --> 00:39:48,605
Bruxelles.

622
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,074
Oui.

623
00:39:51,115 --> 00:39:53,083
Je pense que oui.

624
00:39:54,051 --> 00:39:55,780
Oh, dash!

625
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:59,256
Will someone remove
this violin, please?

626
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:01,087
We just found out
she's Belgian.

627
00:40:01,125 --> 00:40:02,217
Poor thing.

628
00:40:02,259 --> 00:40:03,419
From Brussels.

629
00:40:04,962 --> 00:40:06,395
If you don't mind.

630
00:40:12,303 --> 00:40:13,861
Is your name Gabrielle?

631
00:40:15,106 --> 00:40:16,266
Gabrielle?

632
00:40:16,941 --> 00:40:18,772
I don't know.

633
00:40:20,077 --> 00:40:22,477
And your husband's
name is Emile?

634
00:40:23,814 --> 00:40:24,940
Emile.

635
00:40:24,982 --> 00:40:26,040
Where is he?

636
00:40:26,083 --> 00:40:28,108
What are you doing in London?

637
00:40:28,152 --> 00:40:29,949
I don't know.

638
00:40:29,987 --> 00:40:31,887
When did you arrive
from Brussels?

639
00:40:31,922 --> 00:40:33,549
Where are you staying?

640
00:40:33,591 --> 00:40:35,354
I don't know!

641
00:40:35,393 --> 00:40:37,327
What happened at the river?

642
00:40:37,361 --> 00:40:38,885
Think!

643
00:40:38,929 --> 00:40:40,521
Pensez!

644
00:40:42,433 --> 00:40:43,400
That's enough, Holmes.

645
00:40:43,434 --> 00:40:44,458
I will not permit you...

646
00:40:44,502 --> 00:40:45,969
to question her
in this condition.

647
00:40:47,838 --> 00:40:49,169
Here, Mrs. Hudson.

648
00:40:50,508 --> 00:40:52,703
Put her to bed, my bed.

649
00:40:52,743 --> 00:40:55,644
I'll sleep on the couch.

650
00:40:55,679 --> 00:40:57,044
Come on.

651
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:00,842
I better give her
a sleeping draught.

652
00:41:00,885 --> 00:41:01,909
Watson, I think
we should arrange...

653
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:03,783
to have her removed
to a hospital.

654
00:41:03,821 --> 00:41:04,810
Under no circumstances.

655
00:41:04,855 --> 00:41:06,322
She should have
medical attention.

656
00:41:06,357 --> 00:41:07,756
She can get that from me...

657
00:41:07,792 --> 00:41:10,158
but more important,
she must be protected.

658
00:41:10,194 --> 00:41:11,991
There's already been
one attempt on her life.

659
00:41:12,029 --> 00:41:14,520
This temporary amnesia,
how temporary is it?

660
00:41:14,565 --> 00:41:16,430
It depends on the extent
of her injury.

661
00:41:16,467 --> 00:41:19,163
It's like veils
shrouding her memory.

662
00:41:19,203 --> 00:41:20,568
It could clear up
in a few days...

663
00:41:20,604 --> 00:41:21,764
or a few weeks.

664
00:41:21,806 --> 00:41:23,865
Watson, this is
a very small flat.

665
00:41:23,908 --> 00:41:25,603
We don't want to
clutter it up with women.

666
00:41:25,643 --> 00:41:27,804
Holmes, we've never
had a case like this.

667
00:41:27,845 --> 00:41:29,642
A woman comes to us
with a problem.

668
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,772
We don't know who the woman is.

669
00:41:30,815 --> 00:41:32,442
We don't know
what the problem is.

670
00:41:32,483 --> 00:41:33,609
Don't you find
that challenging?

671
00:41:33,651 --> 00:41:34,777
Quite...

672
00:41:34,819 --> 00:41:37,481
but we can't afford to wait
for these veils to lift.

673
00:41:37,521 --> 00:41:39,955
We must break through them
as quickly as possible.

674
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:41,685
You really feel
it's that urgent?

675
00:41:41,725 --> 00:41:42,885
I do.

676
00:41:45,162 --> 00:41:46,857
The sooner we solve the case...

677
00:41:46,897 --> 00:41:48,694
the sooner we can
get rid of her.

678
00:41:51,001 --> 00:41:52,332
Oh.

679
00:43:24,795 --> 00:43:26,126
Emile?

680
00:43:32,436 --> 00:43:34,028
Emile.

681
00:43:38,275 --> 00:43:39,674
Emile.

682
00:43:41,478 --> 00:43:43,105
Is that you, Emile?

683
00:43:47,985 --> 00:43:49,850
Yes, Gabrielle.

684
00:43:51,655 --> 00:43:53,520
Oh, Emile.

685
00:43:53,557 --> 00:43:56,526
I thought I would
never find you.

686
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:00,394
Oh. Oh, Emile.
Hold me tight.

687
00:44:00,431 --> 00:44:03,958
It's been such a long time...

688
00:44:04,001 --> 00:44:05,866
so many nights.

689
00:44:07,204 --> 00:44:10,071
Do you know what I did
before I left Brussels?

690
00:44:10,107 --> 00:44:11,233
What?

691
00:44:11,275 --> 00:44:14,039
I hope you're not going
to be angry with me.

692
00:44:14,078 --> 00:44:16,740
I bought myself
an expensive negligee.

693
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:18,304
Did you?

694
00:44:18,349 --> 00:44:24,117
A pink negligee
with marabou feathers.

695
00:44:25,389 --> 00:44:27,516
Don't you think it's
a little bit foolish...

696
00:44:27,558 --> 00:44:28,923
for a married woman?

697
00:44:30,561 --> 00:44:31,926
Come on.

698
00:44:34,798 --> 00:44:36,561
Where is the negligee?

699
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:39,160
In my luggage. Come here.

700
00:44:40,671 --> 00:44:43,139
And where is your luggage?

701
00:44:43,173 --> 00:44:45,733
Oh, I don't know.

702
00:44:46,944 --> 00:44:50,471
Come, Emile.
Come, come here.

703
00:44:50,514 --> 00:44:54,280
Please. Oh, please.
Come here.

704
00:45:03,994 --> 00:45:06,019
What is it, Emile?

705
00:45:06,063 --> 00:45:07,826
What are you doing?

706
00:45:22,279 --> 00:45:23,769
Dr. Watson.

707
00:45:26,617 --> 00:45:28,585
Porridge is getting lumpy.

708
00:45:28,619 --> 00:45:29,916
Hadn't you better get up?

709
00:45:31,221 --> 00:45:34,486
I would like to
very much, but...

710
00:45:34,525 --> 00:45:36,425
Mrs. Hudson, would you mind...

711
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:38,758
planting your knee
in the small of my back?

712
00:45:38,796 --> 00:45:39,854
Yes, I would.

713
00:45:39,897 --> 00:45:42,331
Please. I'm in
excruciating pain.

714
00:45:43,967 --> 00:45:44,991
A bit higher...

715
00:45:45,035 --> 00:45:46,866
just below my seventh vertebra.

716
00:45:46,904 --> 00:45:48,872
That's good.
Put your arms under mine.

717
00:45:48,906 --> 00:45:50,771
Now fold them behind my neck.

718
00:45:50,808 --> 00:45:52,469
Now give it a good snap.

719
00:45:53,143 --> 00:45:55,805
No. No. Show no mercy.
Bear down on me.

720
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:01,108
Bless you.

721
00:46:01,151 --> 00:46:02,482
That darn couch.

722
00:46:03,854 --> 00:46:06,322
Oh, you better see
if our patient is awake.

723
00:46:13,597 --> 00:46:14,723
Dr. Watson...

724
00:46:14,765 --> 00:46:17,393
she's gone.

725
00:46:17,434 --> 00:46:18,662
Gone?

726
00:46:22,773 --> 00:46:25,139
Holmes! Holmes!

727
00:46:25,175 --> 00:46:26,938
She's gone!

728
00:46:30,948 --> 00:46:33,178
Well, I never.

729
00:46:36,854 --> 00:46:38,446
Mmm, I smell porridge.

730
00:46:38,489 --> 00:46:40,252
Lumpy as usual, I suppose.

731
00:46:40,290 --> 00:46:41,279
Ah, there you are, Holmes.

732
00:46:41,325 --> 00:46:42,917
We were just
wondering how, uh...

733
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,791
We certainly were.

734
00:46:44,828 --> 00:46:46,420
Mrs. Hudson,
why don't you...

735
00:46:46,463 --> 00:46:49,091
go down to the kitchen,
get a towel, and wipe...

736
00:46:49,133 --> 00:46:51,226
that look of disapproval
off your face.

737
00:46:53,303 --> 00:46:55,771
Liberties in my house.

738
00:46:55,806 --> 00:46:57,603
You can't really blame her.

739
00:46:57,641 --> 00:46:59,040
I mean, the way it looks.

740
00:46:59,076 --> 00:47:00,441
If I didn't know you better...

741
00:47:00,477 --> 00:47:02,968
I might suspect you'd taken
advantage of the young lady.

742
00:47:03,013 --> 00:47:05,106
As a matter of fact,
I did take advantage of her.

743
00:47:05,149 --> 00:47:06,616
Would you hand me
the butter knife, please?

744
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:07,878
Of course.

745
00:47:10,387 --> 00:47:11,877
You did what?

746
00:47:11,922 --> 00:47:13,219
Thank you.

747
00:47:13,257 --> 00:47:15,225
Holmes, this is reprehensible.

748
00:47:15,259 --> 00:47:17,318
Where are your
professional ethics?

749
00:47:17,361 --> 00:47:19,295
Have you no sense
of decency, no shame?

750
00:47:19,329 --> 00:47:21,388
None whatsoever.
If you must know...

751
00:47:21,432 --> 00:47:24,026
I found her body
quite rewarding.

752
00:47:25,035 --> 00:47:26,297
You cad!

753
00:47:26,336 --> 00:47:29,601
Especially the palm
of her right hand.

754
00:47:31,575 --> 00:47:33,372
I'd rather not hear about it.

755
00:47:33,410 --> 00:47:34,843
Very well.
Then I won't bother...

756
00:47:34,878 --> 00:47:36,812
to tell you how
I traced her suitcase.

757
00:47:39,116 --> 00:47:40,413
That's her suitcase?

758
00:47:40,451 --> 00:47:42,214
Remember that piece
of soggy cardboard...

759
00:47:42,252 --> 00:47:43,742
with our address on it?

760
00:47:43,787 --> 00:47:45,254
It was a luggage ticket.

761
00:47:45,289 --> 00:47:47,257
The number had
rubbed off on her hand.

762
00:47:47,291 --> 00:47:49,259
And since she must've
arrived from Brussels...

763
00:47:49,293 --> 00:47:51,158
by the boat train,
I concluded that she had...

764
00:47:51,195 --> 00:47:53,686
checked her belongings
at Victoria Station.

765
00:47:53,730 --> 00:47:55,095
By Jove, if you're right...

766
00:47:55,132 --> 00:47:57,100
we should find a clue
to her identity.

767
00:47:57,134 --> 00:48:00,297
Or at least a pink negligee
with marabou feathers.

768
00:48:01,638 --> 00:48:03,128
Voila.

769
00:48:03,173 --> 00:48:05,198
Well, let's see.
What else is in here?

770
00:48:11,582 --> 00:48:14,551
Now we're getting somewhere.

771
00:48:14,585 --> 00:48:17,713
Oh. Who do you
suppose this is?

772
00:48:26,597 --> 00:48:28,792
Good morning, Madame Valladon.

773
00:48:28,832 --> 00:48:31,300
You are Gabrielle Valladon?

774
00:48:31,335 --> 00:48:32,563
Yes.

775
00:48:32,603 --> 00:48:34,901
And this is your husband
Emile Valladon.

776
00:48:34,938 --> 00:48:36,929
Yes.

777
00:48:36,974 --> 00:48:38,908
Sorry to have
ransacked your valise...

778
00:48:38,942 --> 00:48:41,172
but since you
came to us for help...

779
00:48:42,279 --> 00:48:43,906
Where am I?

780
00:48:43,947 --> 00:48:47,405
221-B Baker Street.

781
00:48:47,451 --> 00:48:48,645
Oh, yes.

782
00:48:49,853 --> 00:48:52,253
Which one of you
is Sherlock Holmes...

783
00:48:52,289 --> 00:48:53,620
and which is Dr. Watson?

784
00:48:53,657 --> 00:48:55,420
Dr. Watson
is the handsome one.

785
00:48:57,761 --> 00:49:00,161
That's the way
he affects most women.

786
00:49:01,965 --> 00:49:03,933
Coffee. You want
some strong coffee.

787
00:49:03,967 --> 00:49:06,527
It's all so confusing.

788
00:49:06,570 --> 00:49:08,504
Well, let's try to sort it out.

789
00:49:09,773 --> 00:49:13,038
You came to London
looking for your husband, right?

790
00:49:13,076 --> 00:49:15,374
Yes.

791
00:49:15,412 --> 00:49:17,380
He's a mining engineer.

792
00:49:17,414 --> 00:49:20,383
We were married
five years ago in the Congo.

793
00:49:20,417 --> 00:49:22,885
Where your husband was
working in a copper mine.

794
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:23,944
How did you know?

795
00:49:23,987 --> 00:49:25,750
Your wedding ring...
it's made of copper.

796
00:49:29,226 --> 00:49:33,356
Last year, he invented
a new kind of air pump...

797
00:49:33,397 --> 00:49:37,333
and was hired by an English
company... Jonah, Limited.

798
00:49:37,367 --> 00:49:38,561
Here we are.

799
00:49:39,937 --> 00:49:41,632
Jonah, Limited. Go on.

800
00:49:43,607 --> 00:49:45,632
We've been writing
to each other regularly...

801
00:49:45,676 --> 00:49:47,610
then suddenly...

802
00:49:47,644 --> 00:49:51,080
three weeks ago,
his letters stopped.

803
00:49:51,114 --> 00:49:54,242
I kept on writing,
but no answer.

804
00:49:54,284 --> 00:49:58,618
So, finally I decided
to go to that address.

805
00:49:59,723 --> 00:50:01,691
"32 Ashdown Street."

806
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:07,090
Yes. It's just
an empty store...

807
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:09,291
nobody there.

808
00:50:09,333 --> 00:50:13,064
So, I tried to find
Jonah, Limited.

809
00:50:13,103 --> 00:50:16,004
No such company exists.

810
00:50:16,039 --> 00:50:18,030
How decidedly odd.

811
00:50:18,075 --> 00:50:20,168
Madame Valladon, can
you think of any reason...

812
00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:22,144
why your husband
should've lied to you...

813
00:50:22,179 --> 00:50:24,204
about these things?

814
00:50:24,247 --> 00:50:26,442
Emile? Never.

815
00:50:26,483 --> 00:50:28,883
He loves me, and I love him.

816
00:50:28,919 --> 00:50:30,716
I gathered that much.

817
00:50:32,689 --> 00:50:34,657
I went to the police.

818
00:50:34,691 --> 00:50:35,658
They said they would...

819
00:50:35,692 --> 00:50:38,126
send out a missing
persons report...

820
00:50:38,161 --> 00:50:40,959
but they didn't
sound too encouraging.

821
00:50:40,998 --> 00:50:42,966
Then I went to
the Belgian embassy.

822
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,969
They suggested
I should consult you.

823
00:50:46,003 --> 00:50:47,971
You could've done worse.

824
00:50:48,005 --> 00:50:49,632
I was on my way here.

825
00:50:49,673 --> 00:50:53,609
Then suddenly there were
footsteps behind me...

826
00:50:53,644 --> 00:50:56,010
and a hand over my mouth...

827
00:50:56,046 --> 00:50:59,948
and a smell of chloroform,
and the next thing I knew...

828
00:50:59,983 --> 00:51:01,974
I was in the water.

829
00:51:02,019 --> 00:51:05,113
And then a man was
wrapping me in a blanket.

830
00:51:05,155 --> 00:51:06,122
Madame Valladon...

831
00:51:06,156 --> 00:51:08,090
somebody tried to
kill you last night.

832
00:51:08,125 --> 00:51:09,888
Do you have any idea
who could've done it?

833
00:51:09,926 --> 00:51:12,918
I don't understand any of it.

834
00:51:12,963 --> 00:51:15,932
Oh, what does it all
mean, Mr. Holmes?

835
00:51:15,966 --> 00:51:17,433
Where is my husband?

836
00:51:17,467 --> 00:51:19,264
You must help me find him.

837
00:51:19,302 --> 00:51:21,293
We'll do our best,
I assure you.

838
00:51:24,474 --> 00:51:27,602
Madame Valladon,
I want you to send...

839
00:51:27,644 --> 00:51:30,135
one more letter
to your husband.

840
00:51:31,148 --> 00:51:33,480
To Emile Valladon...

841
00:51:35,018 --> 00:51:37,452
Ashdown Street...
what was that number?

842
00:51:37,487 --> 00:51:38,818
Thirty-two.

843
00:51:39,856 --> 00:51:42,188
What do you want me
to say in the letter?

844
00:51:42,225 --> 00:51:43,453
Nothing.

845
00:51:43,493 --> 00:51:44,460
Nothing?

846
00:51:44,494 --> 00:51:46,291
Holmes...

847
00:51:46,329 --> 00:51:49,093
you're sending
an empty sheet of paper...

848
00:51:49,132 --> 00:51:50,292
to an empty shop?

849
00:51:50,333 --> 00:51:51,994
That empty shop is
obviously being used...

850
00:51:52,035 --> 00:51:54,629
as an accommodation
address or letter drop.

851
00:51:54,671 --> 00:51:57,469
But what gets dropped
must be picked up.

852
00:51:57,507 --> 00:52:01,170
The question is how
and by whom...

853
00:52:01,211 --> 00:52:02,508
and why?

854
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:37,940
Hammer.

855
00:52:38,782 --> 00:52:40,044
Chisel.

856
00:53:20,590 --> 00:53:21,887
Here.

857
00:53:25,195 --> 00:53:26,594
It's so strange to think...

858
00:53:26,630 --> 00:53:30,794
I've been writing to a place
like this all these months.

859
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:40,871
Look. Canaries.

860
00:53:42,379 --> 00:53:44,040
Suppose this could've
been a pet shop?

861
00:53:44,081 --> 00:53:45,844
Maybe.

862
00:53:45,882 --> 00:53:47,042
Shh.

863
00:53:49,453 --> 00:53:51,182
Here comes our letter.

864
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:02,198
Well, now we are faced with...

865
00:54:02,232 --> 00:54:04,928
the most nerve-racking part
of a detective's job...

866
00:54:04,968 --> 00:54:08,199
doing nothing... just waiting.

867
00:54:08,238 --> 00:54:09,899
- Mr. Holmes?
- Mm-hmm.

868
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:12,204
I don't know how I'm
going to pay for all this.

869
00:54:12,242 --> 00:54:13,971
The purse with my money in it...

870
00:54:14,010 --> 00:54:15,705
is somewhere at
the bottom of the Thames.

871
00:54:15,746 --> 00:54:16,770
It could be worse.

872
00:54:16,813 --> 00:54:18,144
You could be
at the bottom of the Thames...

873
00:54:18,181 --> 00:54:21,708
much to your discomfort
and much to my chagrin.

874
00:54:22,486 --> 00:54:25,011
I don't understand how anybody
picks up letters here.

875
00:54:26,189 --> 00:54:28,680
There's no footprints,
just tracks.

876
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:31,993
What does it mean?

877
00:54:32,028 --> 00:54:34,997
I would surmise somebody
was using ice skates...

878
00:54:35,031 --> 00:54:38,023
if it weren't for
a conspicuous absence of ice.

879
00:54:44,141 --> 00:54:45,472
What do we do now?

880
00:54:45,509 --> 00:54:47,704
This way.

881
00:54:54,785 --> 00:54:56,446
Oh.

882
00:55:01,725 --> 00:55:05,024
Good morning, my pretties.

883
00:55:05,061 --> 00:55:08,030
Here's Mum with your breakfast.

884
00:55:08,064 --> 00:55:10,089
You think I'd forgotten you?

885
00:55:12,502 --> 00:55:17,030
Some of you will be going
on a little trip soon.

886
00:55:17,073 --> 00:55:18,973
I hate to lose you...

887
00:55:19,009 --> 00:55:22,103
but even an old woman's
got to live.

888
00:55:22,145 --> 00:55:24,739
Though you might well ask why.

889
00:55:24,781 --> 00:55:26,840
Oh. Oh!

890
00:55:26,883 --> 00:55:31,616
You never told me.
We have a letter.

891
00:55:43,533 --> 00:55:44,693
Ooh!

892
00:55:56,112 --> 00:55:57,943
- Got it?
- Yeah. All right.

893
00:55:57,981 --> 00:56:01,314
Come on, you old body.

894
00:56:01,351 --> 00:56:02,818
Right. I'll be taking them.

895
00:56:02,853 --> 00:56:05,185
Morning, duchess.

896
00:56:05,222 --> 00:56:06,246
Good morning.

897
00:56:06,289 --> 00:56:08,018
What have you been
doing with yourself?

898
00:56:08,058 --> 00:56:09,184
What do you think?

899
00:56:09,226 --> 00:56:11,990
Taking dancing lessons.

900
00:56:13,897 --> 00:56:16,365
How many do you want this time?

901
00:56:16,399 --> 00:56:17,491
Two dozen.

902
00:56:18,935 --> 00:56:21,961
What are you doing
with all those canaries?

903
00:56:22,005 --> 00:56:23,597
What's going on up there?

904
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:26,973
Now, duchess, we don't know,
and we don't want to know.

905
00:56:27,010 --> 00:56:28,272
When you work for Jonah...

906
00:56:28,311 --> 00:56:30,779
it's better not
to ask questions.

907
00:56:30,814 --> 00:56:31,803
Come on.

908
00:56:31,848 --> 00:56:34,214
Six, eight, ten... get in there.

909
00:56:34,251 --> 00:56:37,948
Fourteen, seventeen... in you go.

910
00:56:37,988 --> 00:56:40,548
Twenty, twenty-four.

911
00:56:40,590 --> 00:56:42,683
How about that letter?
Does that go, too?

912
00:56:42,726 --> 00:56:46,594
No. This is going to be
picked up in person.

913
00:56:48,665 --> 00:56:50,030
Go on.

914
00:56:50,066 --> 00:56:51,328
Right, you got it?

915
00:56:51,368 --> 00:56:52,528
Wait.

916
00:56:53,436 --> 00:56:54,596
All right. Up.

917
00:56:55,539 --> 00:56:58,235
All right, my pretties.

918
00:56:58,275 --> 00:57:00,971
Back to sleep you go.

919
00:57:05,215 --> 00:57:06,944
Ooh!

920
00:57:28,171 --> 00:57:30,469
I really thought
we were done for.

921
00:57:30,507 --> 00:57:33,135
The art of concealment,
my dear Watson...

922
00:57:33,176 --> 00:57:35,474
is merely a matter of
being in the right place...

923
00:57:35,512 --> 00:57:36,979
at the right time.

924
00:57:40,016 --> 00:57:42,143
Did you hear what she said?

925
00:57:42,185 --> 00:57:44,483
You really think Emile
is going to pick up...

926
00:57:44,521 --> 00:57:45,488
the letter himself?

927
00:57:45,522 --> 00:57:48,582
It certainly would
simplify things, wouldn't it?

928
00:57:48,625 --> 00:57:52,026
Letter drops,
wheelchairs, canaries?

929
00:57:53,563 --> 00:57:55,827
And what was
all that about Jonah?

930
00:57:55,865 --> 00:57:58,095
And what do you suppose
they're doing up there?

931
00:57:58,134 --> 00:57:59,158
And where is up there?

932
00:57:59,202 --> 00:58:03,332
My guess would be Scotland...
Inverness, to be more precise.

933
00:58:03,373 --> 00:58:04,340
Inverness?

934
00:58:04,374 --> 00:58:07,707
Didn't you notice the paper
at the bottom of their cage?

935
00:58:07,744 --> 00:58:09,735
"The Inverness Courier."

936
00:58:11,214 --> 00:58:14,012
Mr. Holmes, this letter.

937
00:58:14,050 --> 00:58:15,142
What about it?

938
00:58:16,419 --> 00:58:18,944
It is addressed to you.

939
00:58:18,989 --> 00:58:20,217
To me?

940
00:58:22,325 --> 00:58:24,793
But that's impossible.
We sent it ourselves.

941
00:58:24,828 --> 00:58:26,056
Nevertheless.

942
00:58:30,333 --> 00:58:31,891
"My dear Sherlock...

943
00:58:31,935 --> 00:58:34,597
"I expect you and Dr. Watson
to join me at the club...

944
00:58:34,638 --> 00:58:36,606
"immediately upon
receipt of this note.

945
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:38,574
"According to my calculations...

946
00:58:38,608 --> 00:58:41,406
"that should be at 11:40 A. M.

947
00:58:41,444 --> 00:58:43,969
"Your brother Mycroft."

948
00:58:44,014 --> 00:58:46,414
What time do you
make it, Watson?

949
00:58:48,685 --> 00:58:49,811
11:43.

950
00:58:49,853 --> 00:58:52,981
Either your watch is wrong
or Mycroft has miscalculated...

951
00:58:53,023 --> 00:58:56,288
and knowing Mycroft,
I suggest you reset your watch.

952
00:58:56,326 --> 00:58:57,725
Right.

953
00:59:10,373 --> 00:59:11,863
Holmes...

954
00:59:11,908 --> 00:59:13,341
I don't mind telling you...

955
00:59:13,376 --> 00:59:15,173
I'm a bit apprehensive
about this.

956
00:59:15,211 --> 00:59:17,270
I'm rather curious myself
to know what's going on...

957
00:59:17,313 --> 00:59:18,940
in that Machiavellian
mind of his.

958
00:59:18,982 --> 00:59:20,950
No. I don't mean Mycroft.
I mean Madame Valladon.

959
00:59:20,984 --> 00:59:22,110
Oh, don't worry.

960
00:59:22,152 --> 00:59:23,792
She'll be perfectly safe
with Mrs. Hudson.

961
00:59:26,956 --> 00:59:28,389
To see Mr. Mycroft Holmes.

962
00:59:28,425 --> 00:59:29,449
Right you are, sir.

963
00:59:29,492 --> 00:59:31,790
He's expecting you
in the upstairs study.

964
00:59:31,828 --> 00:59:33,489
Now, if you gentlemen
will sign in.

965
00:59:33,530 --> 00:59:36,761
Surname, Christian name,
address, nature of business.

966
00:59:41,171 --> 00:59:42,695
Gentlemen!

967
01:00:06,529 --> 01:00:09,498
Hmm. Jamaican, no doubt.

968
01:00:09,532 --> 01:00:15,368
Either Tropical or Golacina.
I'm not quite sure.

969
01:00:24,647 --> 01:00:25,614
Come in.

970
01:00:25,648 --> 01:00:27,343
Come in, Sherlock, Dr. Watson.

971
01:00:27,383 --> 01:00:28,816
Sit down.

972
01:00:28,852 --> 01:00:31,480
You're looking very fit,
both of you.

973
01:00:31,521 --> 01:00:33,045
Thank you.

974
01:00:33,089 --> 01:00:34,784
How are you, Mycroft?
How's your gout?

975
01:00:34,824 --> 01:00:38,225
Under control, except for
an occasional twinge.

976
01:00:38,261 --> 01:00:42,288
I've got a treat for you...
very old Madeira, 1814.

977
01:00:42,332 --> 01:00:44,300
There are only six bottles
left in the world.

978
01:00:44,334 --> 01:00:45,460
I've got two of them...

979
01:00:45,502 --> 01:00:46,969
and I'm negotiating
for a third.

980
01:00:47,003 --> 01:00:48,436
If you don't mind
my saying so...

981
01:00:48,471 --> 01:00:51,099
anybody who's susceptible
to gout shouldn't be...

982
01:00:51,141 --> 01:00:52,540
The last doctor who
warned me about that...

983
01:00:52,575 --> 01:00:54,543
was crossing Picadilly,
slipped on an orange peel...

984
01:00:54,577 --> 01:00:56,017
and was run over
by a delivery van...

985
01:00:56,045 --> 01:00:57,478
from Fortnum and Mason.

986
01:00:57,514 --> 01:00:58,811
To your very good health.

987
01:00:58,848 --> 01:01:01,476
Why are you wasting
this precious stuff on us?

988
01:01:01,518 --> 01:01:04,316
I see you so rarely.
How long has it been?

989
01:01:04,354 --> 01:01:07,323
Not since the, uh, case of
the Greek interpreter.

990
01:01:07,357 --> 01:01:08,654
Isn't it ridiculous?

991
01:01:08,691 --> 01:01:10,659
Two brothers,
living in the same town.

992
01:01:10,693 --> 01:01:13,218
Same town, perhaps,
but not in the same world.

993
01:01:14,531 --> 01:01:16,362
This is superb.

994
01:01:16,399 --> 01:01:17,661
How old did you say it was?

995
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:21,033
1814. One year before Waterloo.

996
01:01:21,070 --> 01:01:24,164
One year before Waterloo!

997
01:01:24,207 --> 01:01:25,435
Think of that!

998
01:01:25,475 --> 01:01:28,774
You do know where Waterloo is,
don't you, Doctor?

999
01:01:28,812 --> 01:01:31,906
Why, it's...

1000
01:01:31,948 --> 01:01:33,279
It's in Belgium, isn't it?

1001
01:01:34,484 --> 01:01:35,951
Quite.

1002
01:01:35,985 --> 01:01:37,612
And speaking of Belgium...

1003
01:01:37,654 --> 01:01:39,281
it has come to my attention...

1004
01:01:39,322 --> 01:01:40,789
that you are interested
in the whereabouts...

1005
01:01:40,824 --> 01:01:42,291
of a certain engineer.

1006
01:01:42,325 --> 01:01:43,622
Yes, I am.

1007
01:01:43,660 --> 01:01:45,787
Well, I can save you
a lot of trouble.

1008
01:01:45,829 --> 01:01:47,956
I'd be grateful
for any suggestion.

1009
01:01:47,997 --> 01:01:50,625
My suggestion is that
you pursue it no further.

1010
01:01:50,667 --> 01:01:52,635
For any particular reason?

1011
01:01:52,669 --> 01:01:54,967
Because it involves
the national security.

1012
01:01:55,004 --> 01:01:56,801
We are handling
the matter ourselves.

1013
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:58,307
We? Who's we?

1014
01:01:58,341 --> 01:01:59,968
The Diogenes Club, of course.

1015
01:02:00,009 --> 01:02:00,976
I didn't say that.

1016
01:02:01,010 --> 01:02:02,102
I've always suspected...

1017
01:02:02,145 --> 01:02:03,806
there was some kind of
underground connection...

1018
01:02:03,847 --> 01:02:04,973
between this stodgy...

1019
01:02:05,014 --> 01:02:07,312
and seemingly calcified
establishment...

1020
01:02:07,350 --> 01:02:08,817
and the Foreign Office
in Whitehall.

1021
01:02:08,852 --> 01:02:10,319
That is neither here nor there.

1022
01:02:10,353 --> 01:02:13,117
It seems to me the Diogenes Club
is here, there, and everywhere.

1023
01:02:13,156 --> 01:02:15,249
When there are rumblings
of revolt in the Sudan...

1024
01:02:15,291 --> 01:02:17,589
an expedition
subsidized by your club...

1025
01:02:17,627 --> 01:02:20,118
conveniently shows up to study
the source of the Nile.

1026
01:02:20,163 --> 01:02:22,324
When there's trouble along
the Indian frontier...

1027
01:02:22,365 --> 01:02:24,526
some of your fellow members
pop up in the Himalayas...

1028
01:02:24,567 --> 01:02:27,092
allegedly looking for
the Abominable Snowman.

1029
01:02:31,007 --> 01:02:33,134
What a vivid imagination
my brother has.

1030
01:02:33,176 --> 01:02:34,507
At the age of five...

1031
01:02:34,544 --> 01:02:36,136
by carefully observing
a neighbor's house...

1032
01:02:36,179 --> 01:02:37,510
he deduced that babies
were brought...

1033
01:02:37,547 --> 01:02:39,515
not by the stork
but by the midwife...

1034
01:02:39,549 --> 01:02:40,846
in her satchel.

1035
01:02:40,884 --> 01:02:43,045
As good an explanation as any.

1036
01:02:46,723 --> 01:02:47,849
Yes, Wiggins?

1037
01:02:47,891 --> 01:02:49,518
An immediate answer
is requested, sir.

1038
01:02:49,559 --> 01:02:50,719
Oh, yes.

1039
01:02:58,568 --> 01:03:00,536
Tell them that the three boxes
go to Glennahurich...

1040
01:03:00,570 --> 01:03:02,367
and the red runner
goes to the castle.

1041
01:03:02,405 --> 01:03:03,685
The three boxes to Glennahurich.

1042
01:03:03,706 --> 01:03:06,197
The red runner to the castle.
Very good, sir.

1043
01:03:15,351 --> 01:03:17,979
Why don't you crumple it up
and swallow it...

1044
01:03:18,021 --> 01:03:19,113
just to make sure?

1045
01:03:19,155 --> 01:03:21,646
My dear Sherlock,
there are certain affairs...

1046
01:03:21,691 --> 01:03:23,591
that do not come
within the province...

1047
01:03:23,626 --> 01:03:25,651
of the private detective.

1048
01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:27,492
They have to be dealt with...

1049
01:03:27,530 --> 01:03:29,555
on an altogether
different level.

1050
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:30,827
In other words...

1051
01:03:30,867 --> 01:03:32,892
you want me to stay
within my limits.

1052
01:03:32,936 --> 01:03:34,062
I do, indeed.

1053
01:03:34,103 --> 01:03:35,195
And speaking of limits...

1054
01:03:35,238 --> 01:03:37,763
what, exactly,
is "Jonah, Limited"?

1055
01:03:38,508 --> 01:03:40,066
Sherlock, when I said
drop this case...

1056
01:03:40,109 --> 01:03:41,440
it was not merely a suggestion.

1057
01:03:41,477 --> 01:03:42,842
It was an order.

1058
01:03:42,879 --> 01:03:44,005
By whose authority?

1059
01:03:44,047 --> 01:03:45,674
By the authority of
Her Majesty's government.

1060
01:03:45,715 --> 01:03:47,842
I hope I have made myself clear.

1061
01:03:50,553 --> 01:03:51,850
Perfectly.

1062
01:03:51,888 --> 01:03:54,379
And now if you'll
excuse me, gentlemen...

1063
01:03:55,892 --> 01:03:56,859
Good-bye, sir.

1064
01:03:56,893 --> 01:03:58,383
A pleasure, as always.

1065
01:04:02,031 --> 01:04:03,965
Just a minute.

1066
01:04:05,902 --> 01:04:09,235
You forgot your... "tool kit."

1067
01:04:21,517 --> 01:04:22,882
You will be gentle, won't you...

1068
01:04:22,919 --> 01:04:24,318
when you tell her
you're dropping the case?

1069
01:04:24,354 --> 01:04:25,844
Watson, what does
the word Glennahurich...

1070
01:04:25,888 --> 01:04:27,116
suggest to you?

1071
01:04:27,156 --> 01:04:28,123
Absolutely nothing.

1072
01:04:28,157 --> 01:04:29,283
- It's Scottish.
- Is it?

1073
01:04:29,325 --> 01:04:31,987
And like all Scottish names,
it's really a word picture.

1074
01:04:32,028 --> 01:04:35,327
Glen means "valley,"
na means "of the"...

1075
01:04:35,365 --> 01:04:37,663
and hurich,
if memory serves me...

1076
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:39,133
means "yew tree."

1077
01:04:39,168 --> 01:04:41,329
You're just
trying to impress me.

1078
01:04:41,371 --> 01:04:45,398
So, the three boxes go to
the valley of the yew tree.

1079
01:04:58,421 --> 01:05:00,981
And I'll be in Scotland before...

1080
01:05:01,024 --> 01:05:02,685
You are dropping the case,
aren't you, Holmes?

1081
01:05:02,725 --> 01:05:03,885
Open that door.

1082
01:05:11,801 --> 01:05:12,961
Don't shoot, Mrs. Hudson.

1083
01:05:13,002 --> 01:05:15,368
You're liable to lose
two excellent tenants.

1084
01:05:15,405 --> 01:05:17,168
Oh, at last.

1085
01:05:17,206 --> 01:05:19,970
It's been a ghastly experience.

1086
01:05:20,009 --> 01:05:21,306
Why? What's happened?

1087
01:05:21,344 --> 01:05:22,811
Did you ever try
doing embroidery...

1088
01:05:22,845 --> 01:05:24,312
with a gun in your hand?

1089
01:05:24,347 --> 01:05:26,781
You'll be relieved to know
it was not loaded.

1090
01:05:30,153 --> 01:05:33,122
Holmes, are you planning
to disobey Mycroft's orders?

1091
01:05:33,156 --> 01:05:34,987
He's not just
your brother, you know.

1092
01:05:35,024 --> 01:05:37,686
You'll be defying
Her Majesty's government.

1093
01:05:39,695 --> 01:05:42,357
Any news?
Did you find out anything?

1094
01:05:44,534 --> 01:05:47,059
Let's just say I know
what the next step will be.

1095
01:05:47,103 --> 01:05:48,070
Yes?

1096
01:05:48,104 --> 01:05:49,128
I want you to pack your things.

1097
01:05:49,172 --> 01:05:50,503
Where are we going?

1098
01:05:50,540 --> 01:05:51,837
Holmes, let me caution you...

1099
01:05:51,874 --> 01:05:53,865
At 7:30 this evening,
Dr. Watson and I...

1100
01:05:53,910 --> 01:05:55,810
are going to take you
to Victoria Station...

1101
01:05:55,845 --> 01:05:57,506
and put you on the boat train.

1102
01:05:57,547 --> 01:05:58,673
The boat train?

1103
01:05:58,714 --> 01:05:59,840
Oh, that's better.

1104
01:05:59,882 --> 01:06:01,816
You're sending me
back to Brussels...

1105
01:06:01,851 --> 01:06:02,840
is that it?

1106
01:06:02,885 --> 01:06:04,147
Madame Valladon,
you must understand...

1107
01:06:04,187 --> 01:06:05,677
I came here to find my husband.

1108
01:06:05,721 --> 01:06:07,154
You were going to help me.

1109
01:06:07,190 --> 01:06:09,522
Yes, my dear,
but circumstances have changed.

1110
01:06:09,559 --> 01:06:11,652
The great detective.

1111
01:06:12,795 --> 01:06:14,956
Maybe this case is
too small for you.

1112
01:06:14,997 --> 01:06:15,964
On the contrary...

1113
01:06:15,998 --> 01:06:17,488
it's being handled
on a much higher...

1114
01:06:17,533 --> 01:06:19,000
I won't go back to Brussels!

1115
01:06:19,035 --> 01:06:21,026
Maybe you're giving up,
but I am not.

1116
01:06:21,070 --> 01:06:23,038
I'm going to go on
looking for him...

1117
01:06:23,072 --> 01:06:24,630
and nobody's going to stop me!

1118
01:06:24,674 --> 01:06:26,335
Even if they try to kill me!

1119
01:06:26,375 --> 01:06:28,309
Are you quite finished?

1120
01:06:29,078 --> 01:06:30,568
If you recall,
what I said was that...

1121
01:06:30,613 --> 01:06:32,376
we were going to put
you on the boat train.

1122
01:06:32,415 --> 01:06:34,508
I didn't say you were
going to stay on it.

1123
01:06:34,550 --> 01:06:35,517
She's not?

1124
01:06:35,551 --> 01:06:37,519
At 7:30, Mr. Holmes
and Dr. Watson...

1125
01:06:37,553 --> 01:06:39,851
will be seen waving good-bye
to Madame Valladon...

1126
01:06:39,889 --> 01:06:41,015
at Victoria Station.

1127
01:06:41,057 --> 01:06:44,458
At 8:12, Mr. and Mrs. Ashdown...

1128
01:06:44,494 --> 01:06:47,088
accompanied by
their valet John...

1129
01:06:47,130 --> 01:06:48,688
will appear at Euston Station...

1130
01:06:48,731 --> 01:06:51,256
and board the Highland Express
to Inverness.

1131
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:54,292
Mister and missis.

1132
01:06:54,337 --> 01:06:55,497
Thank you.

1133
01:06:56,839 --> 01:06:58,534
I'm sorry for what I said.

1134
01:06:59,909 --> 01:07:01,171
That's not necessary.

1135
01:07:02,712 --> 01:07:04,612
I'll go and pack.

1136
01:07:05,414 --> 01:07:07,678
Maybe I should do it,
since I'm the valet.

1137
01:07:07,717 --> 01:07:09,344
Holmes, exactly what
are you up to?

1138
01:07:09,385 --> 01:07:11,683
As you like to put it
in your chronicles...

1139
01:07:11,721 --> 01:07:13,018
the game is afoot!

1140
01:07:13,055 --> 01:07:14,147
But what game?

1141
01:07:14,190 --> 01:07:16,852
Are you really that interested
in the Belgian engineer?

1142
01:07:16,893 --> 01:07:19,862
Or is it the wife of
the Belgian engineer?

1143
01:07:25,668 --> 01:07:27,795
You don't like me
very much, do you?

1144
01:07:27,837 --> 01:07:30,465
Nothing of the sort.
Quite the opposite...

1145
01:07:30,506 --> 01:07:33,339
but there's more to this case
than meets the eye.

1146
01:07:35,511 --> 01:07:36,739
Looking for something?

1147
01:07:39,248 --> 01:07:40,977
Yes. My other glove.

1148
01:07:41,817 --> 01:07:42,977
Let me help you.

1149
01:07:55,031 --> 01:07:56,293
Here it is.

1150
01:07:58,701 --> 01:07:59,998
Thank you.

1151
01:08:34,837 --> 01:08:36,668
All right. You can look now.

1152
01:08:39,342 --> 01:08:41,469
Am I embarrassing you,
Mr. Holmes?

1153
01:08:41,510 --> 01:08:43,307
Not at all.
Would it surprise you...

1154
01:08:43,346 --> 01:08:46,713
if I told you I once
spent a night with 121 women?

1155
01:08:46,749 --> 01:08:47,716
Oh?

1156
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:51,186
A very interesting case...
in a harem in Constantinople.

1157
01:09:00,029 --> 01:09:02,998
Oh! I'm... sorry, Father.

1158
01:09:03,032 --> 01:09:06,365
I mean, Friar. Or is it Abbot?

1159
01:09:15,711 --> 01:09:17,611
Going to Scotland,
you gentlemen?

1160
01:09:17,647 --> 01:09:18,807
So are we.

1161
01:09:26,322 --> 01:09:27,619
I'm a valet.

1162
01:09:27,657 --> 01:09:31,616
My master and mistress and I
are on our way to Inverness.

1163
01:09:31,661 --> 01:09:34,391
Ever been there?
Beautiful country.

1164
01:09:36,632 --> 01:09:37,599
Oh, forgive me.

1165
01:09:37,633 --> 01:09:40,932
You must be one of those orders
that's taken the vow of silence?

1166
01:09:40,970 --> 01:09:42,699
Trappists,
I think you're called.

1167
01:09:51,347 --> 01:09:53,008
I see you're reading
"The Book of Jonah."

1168
01:09:53,049 --> 01:09:55,916
Funny. We were just talking
about Jonah this morning.

1169
01:09:58,587 --> 01:09:59,747
Never mind.

1170
01:10:10,232 --> 01:10:14,191
Hmm..."Women are never
to be entirely trusted...

1171
01:10:14,236 --> 01:10:16,397
"not the best of them."

1172
01:10:16,439 --> 01:10:17,497
What did you say?

1173
01:10:17,540 --> 01:10:18,734
I didn't say it.

1174
01:10:18,774 --> 01:10:21,334
You did,
according to Dr. Watson.

1175
01:10:21,377 --> 01:10:24,710
He gave me some old copies
of "Strand Magazine."

1176
01:10:24,747 --> 01:10:28,513
The good doctor is constantly
putting words into my mouth.

1177
01:10:28,551 --> 01:10:30,348
Then you deny it.

1178
01:10:30,386 --> 01:10:32,354
Not at all.

1179
01:10:32,388 --> 01:10:35,516
I am not a wholehearted
admirer of womankind.

1180
01:10:36,859 --> 01:10:39,157
I'm not very fond
of them myself.

1181
01:10:43,566 --> 01:10:47,229
The most affectionate woman
I ever knew was a murderess.

1182
01:10:47,269 --> 01:10:48,531
Oh?

1183
01:10:48,571 --> 01:10:50,539
It was one of those
passionate affairs...

1184
01:10:50,573 --> 01:10:53,371
at odd hours
right in my laboratory.

1185
01:10:53,409 --> 01:10:55,036
And all the time,
behind my back...

1186
01:10:55,077 --> 01:10:56,544
she was stealing cyanide...

1187
01:10:56,579 --> 01:10:59,412
to sprinkle on her husband's
steak and kidney pie.

1188
01:10:59,448 --> 01:11:01,279
You mustn't judge all women by...

1189
01:11:01,317 --> 01:11:02,545
Of course not.

1190
01:11:02,585 --> 01:11:04,553
Only the ones I
was involved with...

1191
01:11:04,587 --> 01:11:06,452
and I don't just
mean professionally.

1192
01:11:06,489 --> 01:11:11,825
Kleptomaniacs, nymphomaniacs,
pyromaniacs...

1193
01:11:12,928 --> 01:11:14,589
Take my fiancee, for instance.

1194
01:11:14,630 --> 01:11:16,188
Your... fiancee?

1195
01:11:16,232 --> 01:11:19,861
She was the daughter
of my violin teacher.

1196
01:11:19,902 --> 01:11:23,531
We were engaged to be married,
the invitations were out...

1197
01:11:23,572 --> 01:11:25,836
I was being fitted
for a tailcoat...

1198
01:11:25,875 --> 01:11:27,843
and twenty-four hours
before the wedding...

1199
01:11:27,877 --> 01:11:29,845
she died of influenza.

1200
01:11:29,879 --> 01:11:31,141
I'm sorry.

1201
01:11:31,180 --> 01:11:35,139
It just proves my contention
that women are unreliable...

1202
01:11:35,184 --> 01:11:37,846
and not to be trusted.

1203
01:11:41,724 --> 01:11:43,555
Good night, Mrs. Ashdown.

1204
01:11:44,627 --> 01:11:46,595
Good night, Mr. Ashdown.

1205
01:12:06,115 --> 01:12:09,380
Sie sputen mach Inverness.
Doch steigen die aus.

1206
01:12:09,418 --> 01:12:11,909
Dort mussen wir
finden den Valladon.

1207
01:12:24,767 --> 01:12:26,735
I will take that.

1208
01:12:26,769 --> 01:12:29,203
Let's see now.
One, two, three, four, five.

1209
01:12:29,238 --> 01:12:31,399
How do you get to Glennahurich?

1210
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:32,566
How far is it?

1211
01:12:32,608 --> 01:12:33,905
Glennahurich...

1212
01:12:33,943 --> 01:12:36,070
You know, a valley
with a yew tree.

1213
01:12:36,111 --> 01:12:38,079
It's about a mile
out of the town.

1214
01:12:38,113 --> 01:12:39,910
Why do you want to go there?

1215
01:12:39,949 --> 01:12:41,750
Well, it sounds like
a nice, peaceful place...

1216
01:12:41,784 --> 01:12:42,751
for a picnic.

1217
01:12:42,785 --> 01:12:44,047
It's a peaceful place,
right enough...

1218
01:12:44,086 --> 01:12:45,849
but it's no place for a picnic.

1219
01:12:45,888 --> 01:12:46,855
Why not?

1220
01:12:46,889 --> 01:12:48,151
Because it's a cemetery.

1221
01:13:24,393 --> 01:13:27,419
The three boxes!
Is that it, Holmes?

1222
01:13:27,463 --> 01:13:29,260
I would think so.

1223
01:13:29,298 --> 01:13:34,031
The two small ones...
they must be children's coffins.

1224
01:13:50,786 --> 01:13:56,418
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes,
dust to dust.

1225
01:13:56,458 --> 01:13:58,221
In sure and certain hope...

1226
01:13:58,260 --> 01:14:00,592
of the Resurrection
to eternal life...

1227
01:14:00,629 --> 01:14:03,120
through our Lord Jesus Christ.

1228
01:14:03,165 --> 01:14:05,292
The grace of
our Lord Jesus Christ...

1229
01:14:05,334 --> 01:14:07,768
and the love of God...

1230
01:14:07,803 --> 01:14:10,101
and the Communion
of the Holy Spirit...

1231
01:14:10,139 --> 01:14:11,868
be with us all.

1232
01:14:11,907 --> 01:14:13,067
Amen.

1233
01:14:32,227 --> 01:14:33,956
It's so sad.

1234
01:14:33,996 --> 01:14:36,294
Sad and rather odd.

1235
01:14:36,332 --> 01:14:39,790
There were no flowers
and no mourners.

1236
01:14:53,015 --> 01:14:54,573
Good morning.

1237
01:14:54,617 --> 01:14:55,777
Morning.

1238
01:14:57,920 --> 01:14:59,217
Working you hard, dad?

1239
01:14:59,254 --> 01:15:01,119
No, not really.

1240
01:15:01,156 --> 01:15:02,555
You see,
this is healthy country.

1241
01:15:02,591 --> 01:15:05,719
Sometimes, you sit around
for weeks with nothing to do.

1242
01:15:05,761 --> 01:15:07,353
Then you get three in one day.

1243
01:15:07,396 --> 01:15:08,454
What happened?

1244
01:15:08,497 --> 01:15:10,226
An accident, aye.

1245
01:15:10,265 --> 01:15:12,426
A father and two sons,
they say.

1246
01:15:12,468 --> 01:15:14,527
They were found floating
in the loch.

1247
01:15:14,570 --> 01:15:15,628
Local people?

1248
01:15:15,671 --> 01:15:18,105
No, no. No one
around here knows 'em.

1249
01:15:18,140 --> 01:15:20,700
The story is their boat
capsized in a swell...

1250
01:15:20,743 --> 01:15:22,711
but I don't believe it.

1251
01:15:22,745 --> 01:15:24,372
What do you believe?

1252
01:15:24,413 --> 01:15:26,381
Well, you may think
I'm an old fool...

1253
01:15:26,415 --> 01:15:28,383
an old drunk, but...

1254
01:15:28,417 --> 01:15:31,944
I've been living around
Loch Ness all me life.

1255
01:15:33,222 --> 01:15:36,055
Are you trying to tell us
it was the monster?

1256
01:15:36,091 --> 01:15:37,456
Damn right.

1257
01:15:37,493 --> 01:15:39,085
MacLaren saw the kids' faces...

1258
01:15:39,128 --> 01:15:40,720
when they were pulled
out of the water.

1259
01:15:40,763 --> 01:15:42,663
Looked just like old men.

1260
01:15:42,698 --> 01:15:44,563
They must've died of fright.

1261
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:45,567
That's incredible.

1262
01:15:45,601 --> 01:15:47,034
Is it?

1263
01:15:47,069 --> 01:15:48,900
Last Easter Sunday,
the wife and me...

1264
01:15:48,937 --> 01:15:52,134
on our way to services,
when suddenly...

1265
01:15:53,175 --> 01:15:54,938
Ah, what's the use?

1266
01:15:56,245 --> 01:15:57,439
Here you are, dad.

1267
01:15:59,848 --> 01:16:01,509
Thank you. Thank you.

1268
01:16:01,550 --> 01:16:03,017
You seem like nice people.

1269
01:16:03,052 --> 01:16:04,952
If you're wanting a holiday
in Scotland...

1270
01:16:04,987 --> 01:16:07,217
go to Loch Lomond,
go to Holy Loch...

1271
01:16:07,256 --> 01:16:10,248
but stay away from Loch Ness.

1272
01:16:14,930 --> 01:16:17,228
To think that people
still believe in that nonsense.

1273
01:16:17,266 --> 01:16:19,791
I mean, here we are, living
in the nineteenth century.

1274
01:16:19,835 --> 01:16:21,666
I'm ashamed to admit it,
but I was relieved...

1275
01:16:21,704 --> 01:16:23,831
when he mentioned
a father and two boys.

1276
01:16:23,872 --> 01:16:26,397
It couldn't have anything
to do with Emile.

1277
01:16:26,442 --> 01:16:27,568
It would appear not.

1278
01:16:27,609 --> 01:16:30,271
However, there still remains
the clue of the castle...

1279
01:16:30,312 --> 01:16:32,371
and the red runner,
whoever he may be.

1280
01:17:03,846 --> 01:17:06,280
If they're
unidentified graves...

1281
01:17:06,315 --> 01:17:08,146
why are those boys
bringing flowers?

1282
01:17:08,183 --> 01:17:10,378
Because it's their brothers
who have just been buried.

1283
01:17:10,419 --> 01:17:11,408
Their brothers?

1284
01:17:11,453 --> 01:17:12,750
And they're not boys.

1285
01:17:12,788 --> 01:17:14,915
They're as tall
as they'll ever grow.

1286
01:17:14,957 --> 01:17:16,219
Hand me some pebbles.

1287
01:17:16,258 --> 01:17:17,350
Pebbles?

1288
01:17:20,863 --> 01:17:23,024
Take a look at their faces.

1289
01:17:38,413 --> 01:17:42,873
They are... how do you
call them in English?

1290
01:17:42,918 --> 01:17:44,351
Midgets.

1291
01:17:45,821 --> 01:17:48,153
Boys with the faces of old men.

1292
01:17:48,190 --> 01:17:49,657
I still don't see...

1293
01:17:49,691 --> 01:17:52,592
Would it help if I told you
they were acrobats?

1294
01:17:53,529 --> 01:17:54,496
Not at all.

1295
01:17:54,530 --> 01:17:56,157
Do you remember a tumbling act...

1296
01:17:56,198 --> 01:17:58,564
six brothers missing
from the circus?

1297
01:17:59,802 --> 01:18:01,702
That case you turned down.

1298
01:18:01,737 --> 01:18:03,034
I completely forgot.

1299
01:18:03,071 --> 01:18:06,199
Some of us are cursed with
memories like flypaper...

1300
01:18:06,241 --> 01:18:08,038
and stuck there is
a staggering amount...

1301
01:18:08,076 --> 01:18:12,069
of miscellaneous data,
mostly useless.

1302
01:18:29,398 --> 01:18:33,357
Mr. Holmes... if those
are not children, then...

1303
01:18:33,402 --> 01:18:34,562
Quite.

1304
01:18:35,571 --> 01:18:38,904
The question now is,
who's in the third grave?

1305
01:19:14,543 --> 01:19:16,534
Holmes! She's fainted!

1306
01:19:19,481 --> 01:19:21,278
Hand me that lantern.

1307
01:19:22,718 --> 01:19:24,811
It is Valladon, isn't it?

1308
01:19:25,921 --> 01:19:29,618
Obviously... but what
is not so obvious...

1309
01:19:29,658 --> 01:19:33,287
is why his wedding ring
has turned green...

1310
01:19:33,328 --> 01:19:36,957
and why there are three
dead canaries in the coffin.

1311
01:19:38,634 --> 01:19:40,898
White canaries.

1312
01:20:19,441 --> 01:20:21,500
You've a lovely view
of the loch from here...

1313
01:20:21,543 --> 01:20:23,841
as soon as the morning mist
rolls away.

1314
01:20:23,879 --> 01:20:26,507
If you have a mind to do
any sightseeing...

1315
01:20:26,548 --> 01:20:29,984
here's a guide to all
the local points of interest.

1316
01:20:30,018 --> 01:20:31,246
Thank you.

1317
01:20:32,220 --> 01:20:34,745
This way, please.
I'll show you to your room.

1318
01:20:37,659 --> 01:20:39,957
I suppose you're putting
me in the basement.

1319
01:20:39,995 --> 01:20:42,293
No, your room's in the attic.

1320
01:20:42,331 --> 01:20:43,389
Good.

1321
01:20:43,432 --> 01:20:45,059
It's the privy that's
in the basement.

1322
01:20:46,068 --> 01:20:47,228
Oh.

1323
01:20:57,279 --> 01:20:59,509
May I have your
wedding ring, please?

1324
01:21:25,407 --> 01:21:26,999
Just as I thought...

1325
01:21:27,042 --> 01:21:29,340
there is a distinct
difference in color...

1326
01:21:29,378 --> 01:21:31,676
between your ring
and your husband's...

1327
01:21:31,713 --> 01:21:33,840
which leads me to believe
that the cause of death...

1328
01:21:33,882 --> 01:21:36,350
was not drowning.

1329
01:21:36,385 --> 01:21:38,376
I wish you would stop that.

1330
01:21:42,724 --> 01:21:43,884
Stop it!

1331
01:21:45,727 --> 01:21:47,695
If we are to continue,
if we are to find out...

1332
01:21:47,729 --> 01:21:48,923
what really happened
to your husband...

1333
01:21:48,964 --> 01:21:51,159
you cannot act
the grief-stricken widow.

1334
01:21:51,199 --> 01:21:54,532
I'm... I'm... sorry.

1335
01:21:56,238 --> 01:21:58,172
I know it's not easy,
but you must remember...

1336
01:21:58,206 --> 01:22:00,265
we're that nice couple
from London...

1337
01:22:00,308 --> 01:22:01,969
on holiday in the Highlands.

1338
01:22:04,212 --> 01:22:05,474
I'll try.

1339
01:22:08,417 --> 01:22:10,544
That's much better.

1340
01:22:10,585 --> 01:22:11,574
Thank you.

1341
01:22:14,589 --> 01:22:17,752
Now, if I may proceed without
further interruptions.

1342
01:22:17,793 --> 01:22:19,192
Mr. Ashdown!

1343
01:22:24,533 --> 01:22:26,262
Holmes, I saw it.

1344
01:22:26,301 --> 01:22:28,394
I saw it from the attic window.
It's out there in the lake!

1345
01:22:28,437 --> 01:22:29,961
- You saw what?
- Telescope!

1346
01:22:30,005 --> 01:22:31,233
Where's the telescope?

1347
01:22:35,243 --> 01:22:36,733
What did you see?

1348
01:22:37,946 --> 01:22:39,379
The monster.

1349
01:22:39,414 --> 01:22:40,574
The monster?

1350
01:22:45,954 --> 01:22:49,822
There... there it is!

1351
01:23:02,070 --> 01:23:03,037
Look for yourself.

1352
01:23:03,071 --> 01:23:04,504
There it is there.
There, there.

1353
01:23:04,539 --> 01:23:05,563
See it?

1354
01:23:06,575 --> 01:23:08,805
There. See it?

1355
01:23:08,844 --> 01:23:10,937
I see nothing.

1356
01:23:10,979 --> 01:23:12,139
Nothing?

1357
01:23:14,649 --> 01:23:15,616
It's gone.

1358
01:23:15,650 --> 01:23:17,242
Gone? Maybe it was never there.

1359
01:23:17,285 --> 01:23:19,719
Holmes, I swear to you,
I saw it as clear as anything!

1360
01:23:19,754 --> 01:23:21,722
Watson, as you
so succinctly put it...

1361
01:23:21,756 --> 01:23:23,317
we are living in
the nineteenth century.

1362
01:23:23,358 --> 01:23:25,326
Maybe that grave digger
was right...

1363
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:27,191
the swell
and the boat overturning.

1364
01:23:27,229 --> 01:23:29,356
Monsieur Valladon may have
been found in the lake...

1365
01:23:29,397 --> 01:23:30,625
but he did not drown.

1366
01:23:30,665 --> 01:23:32,428
He died of asphyxiation.

1367
01:23:35,237 --> 01:23:36,534
Asphyxiation?

1368
01:23:36,571 --> 01:23:37,731
There's only one substance...

1369
01:23:37,772 --> 01:23:39,467
that can turn
a copper ring green...

1370
01:23:39,508 --> 01:23:41,908
and bleach the color
out of canaries...

1371
01:23:41,943 --> 01:23:42,932
chlorine gas.

1372
01:23:42,978 --> 01:23:45,208
Well, that may be,
but the fact remains...

1373
01:23:45,247 --> 01:23:48,216
that I saw something out there!

1374
01:23:48,250 --> 01:23:50,445
A figment of your imagination.

1375
01:23:50,485 --> 01:23:52,715
Now let us be logical.

1376
01:23:52,754 --> 01:23:56,747
The only concrete lead we have
is the reference to the castle.

1377
01:23:56,791 --> 01:24:00,750
The question is... which castle?

1378
01:24:00,795 --> 01:24:02,228
You call yourself logical?

1379
01:24:02,264 --> 01:24:05,859
You're the least
logical man I know.

1380
01:24:05,901 --> 01:24:07,232
Am I?

1381
01:24:07,269 --> 01:24:10,761
How can you say it's a figment
of my imagination...

1382
01:24:10,805 --> 01:24:12,773
when for years
you've been saying...

1383
01:24:12,807 --> 01:24:17,176
I have no imagination
whatsoever?

1384
01:26:12,093 --> 01:26:15,585
We have so far investigated
eight drafty castles...

1385
01:26:15,630 --> 01:26:17,825
had our bicycles
attacked by sheep...

1386
01:26:17,866 --> 01:26:20,027
and our ears assaulted
by bagpipes...

1387
01:26:20,068 --> 01:26:22,036
and we are exactly
where we started.

1388
01:26:22,070 --> 01:26:24,038
Would you like some more
cranberry sauce, dear?

1389
01:26:24,072 --> 01:26:25,369
Yes, dear.

1390
01:26:25,407 --> 01:26:27,375
Would you pass
the cranberry sauce, John?

1391
01:26:27,409 --> 01:26:28,398
Yes, dear.

1392
01:26:33,882 --> 01:26:35,008
I say there!

1393
01:26:35,050 --> 01:26:37,746
Good afternoon! Remember me?

1394
01:26:39,788 --> 01:26:41,221
There's some chaps
I met on the train.

1395
01:26:41,256 --> 01:26:43,281
We had a long conversation,
or rather...

1396
01:26:43,325 --> 01:26:44,553
I had a long conversation...

1397
01:26:44,592 --> 01:26:46,787
because they are
not allowed to talk.

1398
01:26:46,828 --> 01:26:49,558
Trappists, you know?
Just study their bibles.

1399
01:26:49,597 --> 01:26:50,597
Oh, you'll never guess...

1400
01:26:50,598 --> 01:26:52,225
what the one next
to me was reading...

1401
01:26:52,267 --> 01:26:55,065
"The Book of Jonah."
Isn't that odd?

1402
01:26:56,071 --> 01:26:57,231
Quite.

1403
01:27:05,613 --> 01:27:07,581
What is it, dear?
What's the matter?

1404
01:27:07,615 --> 01:27:08,775
Oh, a bee!

1405
01:27:35,744 --> 01:27:36,802
Well, I don't think
we have to bother...

1406
01:27:36,845 --> 01:27:37,812
with this castle.

1407
01:27:37,846 --> 01:27:39,473
It's just a pile of rubble.

1408
01:27:39,514 --> 01:27:43,575
Then why are they taking
all these precautions?

1409
01:27:44,586 --> 01:27:45,848
Why, indeed?

1410
01:27:47,922 --> 01:27:49,549
- Let's go.
- Go where?

1411
01:27:49,591 --> 01:27:51,388
When rebuffed
at the front door...

1412
01:27:51,426 --> 01:27:54,259
one's only choice is to try
the tradesman's entrance.

1413
01:28:16,151 --> 01:28:19,279
Sorry. No visitors allowed.

1414
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:20,514
Are you the guide here?

1415
01:28:20,555 --> 01:28:22,853
Yes, but the castle
is closed to the public...

1416
01:28:22,891 --> 01:28:24,153
while work is going on.

1417
01:28:24,192 --> 01:28:25,591
Oh, what are they doing?

1418
01:28:25,627 --> 01:28:27,151
It's being restored
by the Society...

1419
01:28:27,195 --> 01:28:29,356
for the Preservation
of Scottish Monuments.

1420
01:28:29,397 --> 01:28:30,364
Oh, that's too bad.

1421
01:28:30,398 --> 01:28:32,832
I particularly wanted my wife
to see Urquhart Castle.

1422
01:28:32,867 --> 01:28:34,907
The tower is one of
the most interesting examples...

1423
01:28:34,936 --> 01:28:36,369
of medieval architecture.

1424
01:28:36,404 --> 01:28:38,167
About 1400, wasn't it?

1425
01:28:38,206 --> 01:28:39,366
That's right.

1426
01:28:39,407 --> 01:28:43,400
Let me see, was it built
by James ll or James lll?

1427
01:28:43,445 --> 01:28:46,175
The lll, but if you'd like
to come back next year...

1428
01:28:46,214 --> 01:28:47,214
we'll be finished then...

1429
01:28:47,248 --> 01:28:48,648
and I'll be glad
to show you around.

1430
01:28:49,584 --> 01:28:50,744
Thank you.

1431
01:29:10,405 --> 01:29:11,394
Pleasant sort, isn't he?

1432
01:29:11,439 --> 01:29:12,906
Pleasant, but ignorant.

1433
01:29:12,941 --> 01:29:15,739
He was off one hundred years
and one James.

1434
01:29:15,777 --> 01:29:18,803
It's actually 1500 and James IV.

1435
01:29:21,382 --> 01:29:24,510
If he's an official guide,
shouldn't he know?

1436
01:29:24,552 --> 01:29:26,179
If he's an official guide.

1437
01:29:29,390 --> 01:29:30,830
Listen, do you hear
anything, Watson?

1438
01:29:34,062 --> 01:29:36,690
No. Those birds are making
too much of a racket.

1439
01:29:36,731 --> 01:29:38,426
They're not just birds.

1440
01:29:39,567 --> 01:29:41,262
They're our old friends.

1441
01:29:56,184 --> 01:29:58,049
Sulfuric acid.

1442
01:29:58,086 --> 01:30:00,714
The more we find out,
the less sense it makes.

1443
01:30:00,755 --> 01:30:03,986
To a graduate chemist,
it makes a great deal of sense.

1444
01:30:04,025 --> 01:30:06,391
Sulfuric acid when
exposed to salt water...

1445
01:30:06,427 --> 01:30:08,258
produces chlorine gas.

1446
01:30:11,099 --> 01:30:13,567
John, would you mind
clasping your hands, please?

1447
01:30:13,601 --> 01:30:14,898
Like that?

1448
01:30:14,936 --> 01:30:17,063
No, like that. Lower.

1449
01:30:18,172 --> 01:30:19,469
Thank you.

1450
01:30:39,894 --> 01:30:42,863
That tower may be more
interesting than I thought...

1451
01:30:43,965 --> 01:30:46,331
and not just architecturally.

1452
01:30:53,942 --> 01:30:57,469
Holmes... I have a feeling
we're redundant here.

1453
01:31:19,934 --> 01:31:22,061
We have now
observed the castle...

1454
01:31:22,103 --> 01:31:23,570
from the front, from the back...

1455
01:31:23,605 --> 01:31:25,698
from the side,
from land, from water.

1456
01:31:25,740 --> 01:31:27,833
What now? Planning to spend
the night out here?

1457
01:31:27,875 --> 01:31:29,035
If necessary.

1458
01:31:30,845 --> 01:31:33,040
You're gonna catch
your death of cold, you know.

1459
01:31:33,848 --> 01:31:36,942
Wouldn't it be ironic
if Holmes' last case...

1460
01:31:36,985 --> 01:31:38,350
were a case of pneumonia?

1461
01:31:40,755 --> 01:31:41,915
Sorry.

1462
01:31:46,995 --> 01:31:48,485
What's that?

1463
01:31:54,969 --> 01:31:56,061
Holmes!

1464
01:31:58,373 --> 01:31:59,806
There's... a...

1465
01:31:59,841 --> 01:32:01,866
Quick, Watson! After it!

1466
01:32:29,237 --> 01:32:31,171
Holmes, what are we doing?

1467
01:32:31,205 --> 01:32:33,173
We should be going away from it!

1468
01:32:33,207 --> 01:32:35,107
Keep rowing, damn it!

1469
01:32:58,466 --> 01:32:59,694
We've lost it.

1470
01:33:00,768 --> 01:33:02,531
At least you admit
there is an it...

1471
01:33:02,570 --> 01:33:04,697
not just a figment
of my imagination!

1472
01:33:04,739 --> 01:33:05,899
Quiet!

1473
01:33:10,311 --> 01:33:12,336
Do you have your
stethoscope with you?

1474
01:33:12,380 --> 01:33:13,904
Never without it.

1475
01:33:20,755 --> 01:33:22,120
What is it?

1476
01:33:24,192 --> 01:33:25,853
I can hear something.

1477
01:33:29,063 --> 01:33:31,031
It's getting closer...

1478
01:33:32,366 --> 01:33:34,231
and closer...

1479
01:33:48,783 --> 01:33:50,410
Holmes!

1480
01:33:52,053 --> 01:33:54,248
Get back! Get back!

1481
01:33:55,723 --> 01:33:57,554
Get back... you beast...

1482
01:34:09,737 --> 01:34:11,204
Are you all right?

1483
01:34:11,239 --> 01:34:13,799
I lost my parasol.

1484
01:34:16,711 --> 01:34:18,338
Where's Watson?

1485
01:34:23,484 --> 01:34:24,815
Watson!

1486
01:34:42,670 --> 01:34:43,830
Thank you.

1487
01:34:45,573 --> 01:34:50,738
I...have come face to face
with man-eating tigers.

1488
01:34:50,778 --> 01:34:52,803
I was once caught
in a stampede...

1489
01:34:52,847 --> 01:34:55,281
of wild elephants...
India, you know...

1490
01:34:55,316 --> 01:34:57,216
but I wasn't half as frightened.

1491
01:34:57,251 --> 01:35:00,186
This beast seems to have
a personal grudge against us!

1492
01:35:00,221 --> 01:35:02,917
Well, I just hope
it doesn't come back!

1493
01:35:02,957 --> 01:35:04,424
I don't think it will.

1494
01:35:05,927 --> 01:35:07,258
Look.

1495
01:35:16,470 --> 01:35:18,335
What strange goings-on!

1496
01:35:18,372 --> 01:35:20,306
Not really.

1497
01:35:20,341 --> 01:35:24,243
I would say that the monster,
after a hard day's work...

1498
01:35:24,278 --> 01:35:26,473
has returned home
for his supper.

1499
01:36:00,848 --> 01:36:02,179
Yes, I know.

1500
01:36:02,216 --> 01:36:04,184
But would you believe
you can't borrow...

1501
01:36:04,218 --> 01:36:05,779
a decent pair of trousers
in this place?

1502
01:36:17,031 --> 01:36:20,125
All right, Holmes.
Want to confide in us?

1503
01:36:20,167 --> 01:36:22,135
Whenever he starts whistling...

1504
01:36:22,169 --> 01:36:24,137
I know he's getting close
to a solution.

1505
01:36:24,171 --> 01:36:25,638
It's nothing new, actually.

1506
01:36:25,673 --> 01:36:28,141
We've come across
this situation before.

1507
01:36:28,175 --> 01:36:29,972
We have? Where?

1508
01:36:30,011 --> 01:36:30,978
At the ballet.

1509
01:36:31,012 --> 01:36:31,979
Ballet?

1510
01:36:32,013 --> 01:36:33,640
There's a lake,
and there's a castle...

1511
01:36:33,681 --> 01:36:36,445
and there's a swan that
isn't really a swan...

1512
01:36:36,484 --> 01:36:37,451
or in this case...

1513
01:36:37,485 --> 01:36:39,214
a monster that
isn't really a monster.

1514
01:36:40,888 --> 01:36:41,912
Then what is it?

1515
01:36:41,956 --> 01:36:44,584
What is it, indeed,
that feeds on canary birds...

1516
01:36:44,625 --> 01:36:47,822
and sulfuric acid
and has an engine for a heart?

1517
01:36:47,862 --> 01:36:48,988
An engine?

1518
01:36:49,030 --> 01:36:50,725
The stethoscope is a very
sensitive instrument...

1519
01:36:50,765 --> 01:36:53,165
and water is an excellent
conductor of sound.

1520
01:36:53,200 --> 01:36:55,168
There is no doubt
that we are dealing with...

1521
01:36:55,202 --> 01:36:56,726
a mechanical monster.

1522
01:36:56,771 --> 01:36:57,795
Oh!

1523
01:36:57,838 --> 01:36:59,897
Not only is it equipped
with an artificial heart...

1524
01:36:59,941 --> 01:37:01,909
it also has artificial lungs.

1525
01:37:02,910 --> 01:37:04,810
Judging from the bubbles
on the surface of the lake...

1526
01:37:04,845 --> 01:37:07,473
it uses some form of air pump.

1527
01:37:08,015 --> 01:37:10,677
You think my husband was
involved in all this?

1528
01:37:10,718 --> 01:37:13,687
Yes, Madame Valladon,
I'm sure of it.

1529
01:37:13,721 --> 01:37:17,020
But why would anybody want to
build a mechanical monster?

1530
01:37:17,058 --> 01:37:18,423
Just to scare people?

1531
01:37:18,459 --> 01:37:20,757
Not very likely.

1532
01:37:20,795 --> 01:37:23,355
Why did they try to keep me
from finding my husband?

1533
01:37:24,865 --> 01:37:26,662
And why was he
buried anonymously?

1534
01:37:26,701 --> 01:37:29,261
I think I have
a pretty good notion...

1535
01:37:29,303 --> 01:37:30,395
of what they're up to...

1536
01:37:30,438 --> 01:37:33,805
the Society for the Preservation
of Scottish Monuments...

1537
01:37:33,841 --> 01:37:36,469
better known
as the Diogenes Club!

1538
01:37:36,510 --> 01:37:38,341
Diogenes Club?

1539
01:37:39,246 --> 01:37:40,406
Come in!

1540
01:37:42,516 --> 01:37:44,814
Mr. Ashdown, I have a bottle
of champagne for you.

1541
01:37:45,586 --> 01:37:47,577
A bottle of champagne!

1542
01:37:48,756 --> 01:37:49,984
I didn't order it.

1543
01:37:50,024 --> 01:37:51,992
No, indeed.
You are to deliver it.

1544
01:37:52,026 --> 01:37:53,391
Those are my instructions.

1545
01:37:53,427 --> 01:37:55,918
Instructions from whom?
Deliver it where?

1546
01:37:55,963 --> 01:37:56,987
I wouldn't know, sir...

1547
01:37:57,031 --> 01:37:59,693
but there's a carriage
waiting for you downstairs.

1548
01:38:01,502 --> 01:38:04,164
Are you sure you've got
the right Mr. Ashdown?

1549
01:38:04,205 --> 01:38:06,230
Quite sure, Mr. Holmes.

1550
01:38:18,719 --> 01:38:20,118
Well, Watson...

1551
01:38:20,154 --> 01:38:23,920
I would say the curtain
is going up on the last act.

1552
01:38:23,958 --> 01:38:26,449
I don't like the sound of it.

1553
01:38:26,494 --> 01:38:28,086
Please be careful.

1554
01:38:32,066 --> 01:38:34,330
Holmes, you'd better
take this with you.

1555
01:38:42,009 --> 01:38:44,637
Well... who's minding
the castle?

1556
01:38:44,678 --> 01:38:46,737
You'd better get on.
It's getting late.

1557
01:38:46,781 --> 01:38:49,807
Where are we going?
Some sort of party?

1558
01:38:49,850 --> 01:38:52,148
You won't be disappointed
in the guest list.

1559
01:38:53,521 --> 01:38:54,988
Who's the host?

1560
01:38:55,022 --> 01:38:56,387
Jonah.

1561
01:40:07,528 --> 01:40:09,553
Mr. Ashdown, I presume?

1562
01:40:11,031 --> 01:40:12,658
The red runner, I presume.

1563
01:40:12,700 --> 01:40:16,136
You shouldn't have gone
to all this trouble just for me.

1564
01:40:16,170 --> 01:40:18,104
It's not for you. McKennah?

1565
01:40:18,139 --> 01:40:20,403
May I have
the champagne, please?

1566
01:40:20,441 --> 01:40:22,102
1886.

1567
01:40:22,143 --> 01:40:24,111
Not a very good vintage, is it?

1568
01:40:24,145 --> 01:40:26,443
Mediocre, but then again,
it's not for drinking.

1569
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:28,539
Tie it up, will you?

1570
01:40:28,582 --> 01:40:29,844
In here.

1571
01:40:36,223 --> 01:40:38,623
Interesting... and educational.

1572
01:40:38,659 --> 01:40:40,126
Despite my most
emphatic warning...

1573
01:40:40,161 --> 01:40:41,628
you persisted in meddling.

1574
01:40:41,662 --> 01:40:43,823
It would have served you right
if you had all drowned.

1575
01:40:43,864 --> 01:40:45,525
Sorry to be so unobliging.

1576
01:40:46,901 --> 01:40:48,801
"E. Valladon."

1577
01:40:48,836 --> 01:40:49,962
Hmm...

1578
01:40:50,004 --> 01:40:52,871
I imagine that this belongs
to the pretty lady...

1579
01:40:52,907 --> 01:40:55,205
and this belongs
to your... valet.

1580
01:40:55,242 --> 01:40:57,142
We found them floating
in the lake.

1581
01:40:57,178 --> 01:40:59,146
Speaking about things
floating in the lake...

1582
01:40:59,180 --> 01:41:01,648
how much do you know?
Or... think you know?

1583
01:41:01,682 --> 01:41:04,674
I think you're testing
some sort of underwater craft...

1584
01:41:04,718 --> 01:41:07,186
camouflaged
to mislead the gullible.

1585
01:41:07,221 --> 01:41:09,189
I think it's
an experimental model...

1586
01:41:09,223 --> 01:41:11,123
operated by a crew of midgets.

1587
01:41:11,158 --> 01:41:13,524
I think it is powered by
sulfuric acid batteries...

1588
01:41:13,561 --> 01:41:16,587
and uses canaries
to detect escaping gas.

1589
01:41:17,531 --> 01:41:19,590
Altogether, a unique
contraption.

1590
01:41:19,633 --> 01:41:21,601
Not quite that unique.

1591
01:41:21,635 --> 01:41:24,069
Right now, four countries
are trying to develop...

1592
01:41:24,104 --> 01:41:26,095
what we call a submersible...

1593
01:41:26,140 --> 01:41:28,938
but none of them could
solve the critical problem...

1594
01:41:28,976 --> 01:41:31,672
how to stay submerged long
enough to make it effective.

1595
01:41:32,213 --> 01:41:33,874
What does the good book say?

1596
01:41:34,982 --> 01:41:37,280
"And Jonah lived in
the belly of that fish...

1597
01:41:37,318 --> 01:41:39,752
"for three days
and three nights."

1598
01:41:39,787 --> 01:41:41,277
That was our goal...

1599
01:41:41,322 --> 01:41:42,789
and thanks to
Valladon's air pump...

1600
01:41:42,823 --> 01:41:44,654
we got a jump
on the rest of them.

1601
01:41:44,692 --> 01:41:46,489
It's a highly complex
system of filtration...

1602
01:41:46,527 --> 01:41:48,017
so we had a series of trials...

1603
01:41:48,062 --> 01:41:50,030
And at least one error.

1604
01:41:50,064 --> 01:41:51,531
During a test run
in the Moray Firth...

1605
01:41:51,565 --> 01:41:53,123
pressure caused
a leak in the hull...

1606
01:41:53,167 --> 01:41:55,032
sea water mixed with
the acid in the batteries...

1607
01:41:55,069 --> 01:41:56,627
to produce chlorine gas.

1608
01:41:56,670 --> 01:41:57,864
Before they could reach
the surface...

1609
01:41:57,905 --> 01:41:59,304
Valladon and two of
the crew were dead.

1610
01:41:59,340 --> 01:42:01,331
So you had them buried
in unmarked graves...

1611
01:42:01,375 --> 01:42:02,637
to preserve your secret.

1612
01:42:02,676 --> 01:42:03,768
It was essential...

1613
01:42:03,811 --> 01:42:05,642
to keep the information
from your client!

1614
01:42:05,679 --> 01:42:07,203
You went to all those lengths...

1615
01:42:07,248 --> 01:42:09,739
to prevent Madame Valladon
from finding her husband?

1616
01:42:09,783 --> 01:42:12,547
Your client isn't
Madame Valladon!

1617
01:42:13,554 --> 01:42:16,022
It's the Imperial
German Government.

1618
01:42:16,056 --> 01:42:17,921
They were after
the Belgian engineer...

1619
01:42:17,958 --> 01:42:19,323
or rather his invention.

1620
01:42:19,360 --> 01:42:21,328
They knew he was
employed by us...

1621
01:42:21,362 --> 01:42:22,488
but they couldn't
find out where.

1622
01:42:22,529 --> 01:42:26,989
So they enlisted the best
brain in England to help them.

1623
01:42:27,034 --> 01:42:28,695
You, my dear brother,

1624
01:42:28,736 --> 01:42:30,761
have been working for
the Wilhelm Strasse.

1625
01:42:36,910 --> 01:42:39,845
And Madame Valladon...

1626
01:42:39,880 --> 01:42:41,848
what part did she play
in all of this?

1627
01:42:41,882 --> 01:42:43,873
Madame Valladon is dead.

1628
01:42:43,917 --> 01:42:45,009
Dead?

1629
01:42:45,052 --> 01:42:48,146
The Germans disposed of her
three weeks ago in Brussels.

1630
01:42:51,792 --> 01:42:53,817
This is Gabrielle Valladon.

1631
01:43:04,738 --> 01:43:06,467
The woman who was
brought to your house...

1632
01:43:06,507 --> 01:43:07,872
in the middle of the night...

1633
01:43:07,908 --> 01:43:10,069
apparently fished out
of the Thames...

1634
01:43:10,110 --> 01:43:12,271
and apparently suffering
from amnesia...

1635
01:43:12,313 --> 01:43:14,281
is in fact
llsa von Hoffmanstal...

1636
01:43:14,315 --> 01:43:16,374
one of their most
skillful agents.

1637
01:43:16,417 --> 01:43:19,318
Am I going too fast for
the best brain in England?

1638
01:43:22,656 --> 01:43:23,816
Go on.

1639
01:43:23,857 --> 01:43:26,655
They planted her on you
quite neatly, I must admit...

1640
01:43:26,694 --> 01:43:27,661
so that you could lead them...

1641
01:43:27,695 --> 01:43:29,890
to their objective,
the air pump...

1642
01:43:29,930 --> 01:43:33,764
very much like using a hog
to find truffles.

1643
01:43:33,801 --> 01:43:36,167
And now perhaps
you'd care to join me.

1644
01:43:36,203 --> 01:43:40,572
I'm expecting a certain
royal personage from Balmoral.

1645
01:44:16,410 --> 01:44:17,707
Your Majesty.

1646
01:44:21,882 --> 01:44:23,747
I trust you had
a pleasant journey, ma'am.

1647
01:44:23,784 --> 01:44:26,776
It was long,
and it was tedious...

1648
01:44:26,820 --> 01:44:29,288
and it had better be
worth our while, Mr. Holmes.

1649
01:44:29,323 --> 01:44:31,291
I can assure you, ma'am,
it will be.

1650
01:44:31,325 --> 01:44:35,284
Now, what is this curious ship
we are supposed to christen?

1651
01:44:35,329 --> 01:44:38,264
We call it a submersible, ma'am.
It travels under water.

1652
01:44:38,298 --> 01:44:41,790
Under water?
What a fantastic idea!

1653
01:44:41,835 --> 01:44:44,531
Ma'am, may I present
some of the scientists...

1654
01:44:44,571 --> 01:44:45,868
responsible
for this achievement?

1655
01:44:45,906 --> 01:44:48,704
J. W. Ferguson, naval architect.

1656
01:44:48,742 --> 01:44:49,970
Your Majesty.

1657
01:44:50,010 --> 01:44:52,740
Professor Simson, our leading
expert in hydraulics.

1658
01:44:52,779 --> 01:44:53,905
Your Majesty.

1659
01:44:53,947 --> 01:44:57,246
W. W. Prescott, co-inventor
of the revolving periscope.

1660
01:44:57,284 --> 01:44:58,410
Your Majesty.

1661
01:44:58,452 --> 01:45:00,420
And this is my brother
Sherlock, ma'am.

1662
01:45:00,454 --> 01:45:03,981
Ah, yes! Sherlock Holmes.

1663
01:45:04,024 --> 01:45:05,924
We have been following
your exploits...

1664
01:45:05,959 --> 01:45:07,586
with great interest!

1665
01:45:07,627 --> 01:45:08,753
Thank you, ma'am.

1666
01:45:08,795 --> 01:45:11,559
Are you engaged in one of
your fascinating cases...

1667
01:45:11,598 --> 01:45:12,565
at the moment?

1668
01:45:12,599 --> 01:45:13,964
In a manner of speaking, ma'am.

1669
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:15,160
When can we expect to read...

1670
01:45:15,168 --> 01:45:16,635
Dr. Watson's account
of the case?

1671
01:45:16,670 --> 01:45:17,728
I hope never, ma'am.

1672
01:45:17,771 --> 01:45:20,604
It has not been one of
my more successful endeavors.

1673
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:21,800
Oh.

1674
01:45:52,839 --> 01:45:56,775
There she is, ma'am...
Her Majesty's Ship Jonah.

1675
01:46:09,289 --> 01:46:11,223
And what, may we ask...

1676
01:46:11,258 --> 01:46:13,783
is the purpose of that
hideous gargoyle?

1677
01:46:13,827 --> 01:46:15,454
Merely a decoy, ma'am.

1678
01:46:15,495 --> 01:46:19,226
Oh! To frighten away
the sharks, we imagine.

1679
01:46:19,266 --> 01:46:20,494
Something of the sort.

1680
01:46:25,939 --> 01:46:29,170
The crew will now demonstrate
the workings of the submersible.

1681
01:46:30,944 --> 01:46:31,968
Stand to!

1682
01:46:36,016 --> 01:46:39,247
Aren't they rather small
for sailors?

1683
01:46:39,286 --> 01:46:41,754
They are, ma'am, but because of
the size of the craft...

1684
01:46:41,788 --> 01:46:43,050
the Navy made an exception.

1685
01:46:43,089 --> 01:46:44,784
They should make it a rule.

1686
01:46:44,825 --> 01:46:47,726
It is quite fatiguing
to pin on all those medals...

1687
01:46:47,761 --> 01:46:49,922
while standing on our toes.

1688
01:47:06,346 --> 01:47:08,211
This is the main engine
which propels us under water...

1689
01:47:08,248 --> 01:47:10,216
at the rate of two knots.

1690
01:47:10,250 --> 01:47:12,582
The reciprocating
stabilizer mechanism...

1691
01:47:12,619 --> 01:47:15,986
the high-voltage
acid batteries...

1692
01:47:16,022 --> 01:47:20,049
the multi-stage compressor...
ballast tank trimmer...

1693
01:47:20,093 --> 01:47:22,857
the air pump which filters
and recirculates the air.

1694
01:47:23,663 --> 01:47:25,221
How charming!

1695
01:47:25,265 --> 01:47:26,892
The air pump, ma'am?

1696
01:47:26,933 --> 01:47:30,232
Canaries!
Must make the crew feel at home.

1697
01:47:30,270 --> 01:47:31,737
Yes, ma'am.

1698
01:47:31,771 --> 01:47:33,739
These are for firing
the torpedoes...

1699
01:47:33,773 --> 01:47:36,537
which are accurate
up to as much as 120 feet...

1700
01:47:36,576 --> 01:47:39,067
the telescope for scanning
the surface of the water...

1701
01:47:39,112 --> 01:47:41,410
But where is the glass bottom?

1702
01:47:41,448 --> 01:47:42,972
The what, ma'am?

1703
01:47:43,984 --> 01:47:45,349
The glass bottom!

1704
01:47:45,385 --> 01:47:47,819
You know... to observe the fish.

1705
01:47:47,854 --> 01:47:50,186
And the plants and the cockles.

1706
01:47:50,223 --> 01:47:52,020
That's not quite
the idea, ma'am.

1707
01:47:52,058 --> 01:47:54,856
H. M. S. Jonah has been
commissioned as a warship.

1708
01:47:54,895 --> 01:47:56,294
A warship?

1709
01:48:03,970 --> 01:48:05,437
Stop that noise!

1710
01:48:05,472 --> 01:48:07,303
Stop it!

1711
01:48:07,340 --> 01:48:09,035
Ma'am, if I may explain...

1712
01:48:09,075 --> 01:48:10,235
You had better!

1713
01:48:10,277 --> 01:48:11,744
The admiralty
regards this craft...

1714
01:48:11,778 --> 01:48:13,746
as the ultimate weapon
in naval warfare.

1715
01:48:13,780 --> 01:48:15,042
It can seek out enemy ships...

1716
01:48:15,081 --> 01:48:16,514
and destroy them
with those torpedoes...

1717
01:48:16,550 --> 01:48:19,041
while remaining
completely invisible.

1718
01:48:19,085 --> 01:48:21,713
You mean it can fire
at other vessels...

1719
01:48:21,755 --> 01:48:23,052
while under water?

1720
01:48:23,089 --> 01:48:24,056
Yes, ma'am.

1721
01:48:24,090 --> 01:48:25,057
Without any warning?

1722
01:48:25,091 --> 01:48:26,058
That is correct, ma'am.

1723
01:48:26,092 --> 01:48:27,684
Without showing her colors?

1724
01:48:27,727 --> 01:48:28,955
Indeed, ma'am.

1725
01:48:28,995 --> 01:48:31,793
Mr. Holmes, we are not amused.

1726
01:48:33,633 --> 01:48:37,296
It is unsportsmanlike,
it is un-English...

1727
01:48:37,337 --> 01:48:39,828
and it is in very poor taste!

1728
01:48:39,873 --> 01:48:42,808
We will have none of it!

1729
01:48:42,842 --> 01:48:44,707
I beg your pardon, ma'am.

1730
01:48:46,913 --> 01:48:50,576
Sometimes we despair
at the state of the world.

1731
01:48:50,617 --> 01:48:54,144
What will scientists
think of next?

1732
01:48:54,187 --> 01:48:55,950
That's precisely it, ma'am.

1733
01:48:55,989 --> 01:48:57,013
At this very moment...

1734
01:48:57,057 --> 01:48:58,752
the Germans,
under Count von Zeppelin...

1735
01:48:58,792 --> 01:49:01,226
are experimenting
with a dirigible.

1736
01:49:01,261 --> 01:49:04,458
A dirigible?
And what, pray, is that?

1737
01:49:04,497 --> 01:49:06,192
A rigid balloon
which could fly over London...

1738
01:49:06,232 --> 01:49:08,598
and drop a bomb
on Buckingham Palace.

1739
01:49:08,635 --> 01:49:10,500
It is being developed
at the express orders...

1740
01:49:10,537 --> 01:49:12,732
of Kaiser Wilhelm ll.

1741
01:49:12,772 --> 01:49:17,232
Nonsense! We refuse to believe
that our grandson Willie...

1742
01:49:17,277 --> 01:49:18,710
would do a thing like that!

1743
01:49:18,745 --> 01:49:20,212
We have conclusive proof, ma'am.

1744
01:49:20,246 --> 01:49:22,714
Our agent in Friedrichshafen,
a man named Ibidson...

1745
01:49:22,749 --> 01:49:25,217
actually saw the dirigible
and made a drawing of it.

1746
01:49:25,251 --> 01:49:26,718
Unfortunately,
he was apprehended...

1747
01:49:26,753 --> 01:49:28,721
before he could
cross the border.

1748
01:49:28,755 --> 01:49:33,215
Nevertheless, we want no part
of this beastly invention.

1749
01:49:33,259 --> 01:49:35,853
Get rid of it! Scuttle it!

1750
01:49:35,895 --> 01:49:37,795
The sooner the better!

1751
01:49:37,831 --> 01:49:39,025
May I point out, ma'am...

1752
01:49:39,065 --> 01:49:40,396
And do not concern yourself...

1753
01:49:40,433 --> 01:49:43,925
about that dirigible
dropping bombs on us.

1754
01:49:43,970 --> 01:49:48,134
We shall write a very sharp note
to the kaiser!

1755
01:49:48,808 --> 01:49:52,335
Now... we wish to return
to Balmoral.

1756
01:50:14,267 --> 01:50:15,291
Well, Mycroft...

1757
01:50:15,335 --> 01:50:18,202
it seems we have both
been undone by a woman.

1758
01:50:18,238 --> 01:50:21,207
What a shame...
all that superb engineering...

1759
01:50:21,241 --> 01:50:24,870
and all that cunning
espionage for naught.

1760
01:50:24,911 --> 01:50:26,708
Not necessarily.

1761
01:50:26,746 --> 01:50:29,772
If the Germans want that
submersible so badly...

1762
01:50:29,816 --> 01:50:32,148
why don't we give it to them?

1763
01:50:32,185 --> 01:50:33,550
Give it to them?

1764
01:50:33,586 --> 01:50:36,146
Invite them aboard
for the final journey...

1765
01:50:36,189 --> 01:50:38,623
700 feet straight down.

1766
01:50:40,260 --> 01:50:42,820
And how are you
going to arrange that?

1767
01:50:42,862 --> 01:50:44,989
I'm rather counting
on you to do it...

1768
01:50:45,031 --> 01:50:47,158
since you're on such
intimate terms...

1769
01:50:47,200 --> 01:50:48,929
with Fraulein von Hoffmanstal.

1770
01:50:51,771 --> 01:50:53,796
Shall we say good-bye
to Her Majesty?

1771
01:52:40,146 --> 01:52:42,478
Sorry about that,
but as long as you're up...

1772
01:52:43,950 --> 01:52:46,612
what is the German word
for castle?

1773
01:52:46,653 --> 01:52:47,813
Schlos, isn't it?

1774
01:52:49,222 --> 01:52:50,917
I think so.

1775
01:52:50,957 --> 01:52:54,188
And how would you say
"under the castle"?

1776
01:52:54,227 --> 01:52:57,253
Unten das schlos...
or die schlos?

1777
01:52:59,465 --> 01:53:02,127
I don't know.
My German is not that good.

1778
01:53:04,304 --> 01:53:05,271
Your Trappist friends...

1779
01:53:05,305 --> 01:53:07,068
are waiting outside
to hear from you.

1780
01:53:07,841 --> 01:53:08,808
It's a chilly morning.

1781
01:53:08,842 --> 01:53:09,809
We don't want to keep them...

1782
01:53:09,843 --> 01:53:11,310
standing around too long,
do we...

1783
01:53:13,079 --> 01:53:15,775
Fraulein Hoffmanstal?

1784
01:53:21,821 --> 01:53:23,982
Come now, it's too late
to play cat and mouse.

1785
01:53:29,395 --> 01:53:32,660
Unten dem schlos.

1786
01:53:33,666 --> 01:53:34,826
Thank you.

1787
01:53:36,269 --> 01:53:38,134
Here is your signaling device.

1788
01:53:39,138 --> 01:53:40,662
It's rather bent, I'm afraid.

1789
01:53:41,875 --> 01:53:42,967
Would you care to tell them...

1790
01:53:43,009 --> 01:53:45,102
where they can find
the submersible?

1791
01:53:49,015 --> 01:53:50,175
No?

1792
01:53:51,651 --> 01:53:53,812
Then I shall just have
to do it myself.

1793
01:53:58,925 --> 01:54:01,985
I only hope my Morse code
is adequate to the occasion.

1794
01:54:50,109 --> 01:54:52,669
Well... it's up to
the good monks now.

1795
01:54:52,712 --> 01:54:55,613
You can consider your part
of the mission accomplished...

1796
01:54:55,648 --> 01:54:57,138
Fraulein Hoffmanstal.

1797
01:54:58,151 --> 01:55:02,713
You're all wrong about me.
My name is not Hoffmanstal.

1798
01:55:02,755 --> 01:55:03,744
It isn't?

1799
01:55:03,790 --> 01:55:06,315
It's von Hoffmanstal.

1800
01:55:06,359 --> 01:55:08,554
I stand corrected.

1801
01:55:08,594 --> 01:55:11,085
I suppose once they
are in the castle...

1802
01:55:13,299 --> 01:55:16,427
Must amuse you, Mr. Holmes,
Trappists walking into a trap?

1803
01:55:16,469 --> 01:55:17,697
It's more amusing than that.

1804
01:55:17,737 --> 01:55:19,728
Once in the castle,
they will encounter...

1805
01:55:19,772 --> 01:55:21,569
surprisingly little resistance.

1806
01:55:21,607 --> 01:55:23,802
It will take but a small
bottle of chloroform...

1807
01:55:23,843 --> 01:55:25,401
to overcome the guards.

1808
01:55:25,445 --> 01:55:27,379
You mean you're going to
let them have the air pump?

1809
01:55:27,413 --> 01:55:28,380
Better than that.

1810
01:55:28,414 --> 01:55:30,245
We're going to let them
have the submersible.

1811
01:55:31,451 --> 01:55:33,715
They will find it with its
engines running all set to go.

1812
01:55:33,753 --> 01:55:35,778
I assume they're all
expert sailors.

1813
01:55:35,822 --> 01:55:37,790
And since there's
a German battleship...

1814
01:55:37,824 --> 01:55:39,348
cruising off the coast
of Scotland...

1815
01:55:39,392 --> 01:55:41,485
I expect they'll try to
sail it out of the loch...

1816
01:55:41,527 --> 01:55:42,459
and rendezvous at sea.

1817
01:55:43,629 --> 01:55:45,119
Did you say try to?

1818
01:55:47,300 --> 01:55:50,326
I would suggest you get
your things together.

1819
01:55:50,370 --> 01:55:53,100
Mycroft will be here to
take you into custody.

1820
01:55:56,042 --> 01:55:59,307
I never had you fooled
for a moment, did I?

1821
01:55:59,345 --> 01:56:01,870
You knew right from
the beginning...

1822
01:56:03,016 --> 01:56:05,780
when the cabby brought me
to Baker Street.

1823
01:56:07,587 --> 01:56:08,986
Let me see.

1824
01:56:11,491 --> 01:56:13,550
Not quite that soon.

1825
01:56:13,593 --> 01:56:15,686
It's so funny.

1826
01:56:15,728 --> 01:56:18,322
I asked for this
assignment, you know.

1827
01:56:19,332 --> 01:56:21,960
I was scheduled
to go to Japan...

1828
01:56:22,001 --> 01:56:23,628
but I couldn't resist
the challenge...

1829
01:56:23,669 --> 01:56:26,001
of coming up against the best.

1830
01:56:27,607 --> 01:56:29,802
I'm sorry I didn't give you
a closer game.

1831
01:56:31,944 --> 01:56:33,605
Close enough.

1832
01:56:35,281 --> 01:56:37,249
You're just being kind.

1833
01:56:37,283 --> 01:56:39,183
I failed miserably.

1834
01:56:40,653 --> 01:56:43,121
We all have occasional failures.

1835
01:56:44,257 --> 01:56:47,488
Fortunately, Dr. Watson
never writes about mine.

1836
01:56:52,031 --> 01:56:53,089
Holmes!

1837
01:57:02,175 --> 01:57:04,666
Holmes! I saw it again!

1838
01:57:04,710 --> 01:57:06,110
That thing!
It came from the castle!

1839
01:57:06,145 --> 01:57:07,669
It's out there!

1840
01:57:16,789 --> 01:57:19,724
It was out there. Now it's gone.

1841
01:57:19,759 --> 01:57:20,726
- It's gone?
- Forever.

1842
01:57:20,760 --> 01:57:22,193
Look for yourself.

1843
01:57:26,566 --> 01:57:28,090
A bottle of champagne?

1844
01:57:30,536 --> 01:57:32,060
And a Bible?

1845
01:57:33,573 --> 01:57:37,839
That's all that's left
of H. M. S. Jonah.

1846
01:57:38,945 --> 01:57:39,912
Holmes!

1847
01:57:39,946 --> 01:57:43,211
For once, would you mind
being a little less cryptic?

1848
01:57:43,249 --> 01:57:44,944
It would seem that someone
carelessly loosened...

1849
01:57:44,984 --> 01:57:47,145
the bolts of the submersible.

1850
01:57:48,588 --> 01:57:50,681
What a fitting end
for Trappists.

1851
01:57:50,723 --> 01:57:53,021
Now they are resting
in eternal silence...

1852
01:57:53,059 --> 01:57:54,583
at the bottom of the lake.

1853
01:57:58,431 --> 01:57:59,831
Do you know what
he's talking about?

1854
01:58:03,436 --> 01:58:05,631
Fraulein von Hoffmanstal.

1855
01:58:05,671 --> 01:58:08,265
Yes, Mr. Holmes. I'm all ready.

1856
01:58:08,875 --> 01:58:10,968
If there's one thing I like
about the Prussians...

1857
01:58:11,010 --> 01:58:12,068
it's their punctuality.

1858
01:58:12,111 --> 01:58:15,137
If there's one thing
I dislike about the British...

1859
01:58:15,181 --> 01:58:16,739
it's their climate.

1860
01:58:16,782 --> 01:58:19,114
I understand your jails
are very damp...

1861
01:58:19,152 --> 01:58:22,588
and your heating facilities
totally inadequate.

1862
01:58:22,622 --> 01:58:24,522
They are, but you're
not going to jail.

1863
01:58:24,557 --> 01:58:25,717
You're going back to Germany.

1864
01:58:26,859 --> 01:58:28,121
Germany?

1865
01:58:28,161 --> 01:58:30,220
You will be conducted
to the Swiss/German border...

1866
01:58:30,263 --> 01:58:32,128
and be exchanged for one
of our agents...

1867
01:58:32,165 --> 01:58:33,325
a man named Ibidson.

1868
01:58:35,168 --> 01:58:36,135
Thank you.

1869
01:58:36,169 --> 01:58:38,069
Oh, don't thank me.
Thank my brother.

1870
01:58:38,104 --> 01:58:39,401
It was his idea.

1871
01:58:44,443 --> 01:58:46,968
Frankly, I think we're
making a very poor deal.

1872
01:58:47,013 --> 01:58:48,412
You're much better
than most operatives...

1873
01:58:48,447 --> 01:58:50,210
working for
British intelligence.

1874
01:58:51,017 --> 01:58:52,450
Don't you agree, Sherlock?

1875
01:58:53,486 --> 01:58:56,649
And better than some
consulting detectives.

1876
01:59:16,776 --> 01:59:17,936
Shall we?

1877
01:59:26,552 --> 01:59:27,712
I'll take that.

1878
01:59:36,095 --> 01:59:37,255
Gentlemen.

1879
01:59:46,405 --> 01:59:47,372
All right, Holmes.

1880
01:59:47,406 --> 01:59:48,430
You don't have to
explain anything to me...

1881
01:59:48,474 --> 01:59:49,441
if you don't want to.

1882
01:59:49,475 --> 01:59:50,442
I appreciate that, Watson.

1883
01:59:50,476 --> 01:59:52,842
After all, I'm only
your official biographer!

1884
01:59:52,878 --> 01:59:54,311
Anyway, I don't think
she would care to have...

1885
01:59:54,347 --> 01:59:57,043
this story spread all over
the "Strand Magazine."

1886
01:59:57,850 --> 02:00:00,182
The public has a right
to know these things!

1887
02:00:00,219 --> 02:00:02,210
If she's a German spy...

1888
02:00:02,255 --> 02:00:04,746
why should we concern ourselves
about her feelings?

1889
02:00:21,040 --> 02:00:22,769
Giddyup.

1890
02:00:29,782 --> 02:00:33,218
Holmes, if I promise
not to write a word about it...

1891
02:00:33,252 --> 02:00:36,221
would you enlighten me,
as your friend, as your valet?

1892
02:00:36,255 --> 02:00:37,415
Quiet.

1893
02:00:38,424 --> 02:00:40,221
I'm trying to read
a personal message.

1894
02:00:40,259 --> 02:00:41,726
Message?

1895
02:00:57,677 --> 02:00:58,837
What's she saying?

1896
02:01:00,713 --> 02:01:04,809
Auf... wiedersehen.

1897
02:01:05,584 --> 02:01:08,382
Auf wieder... the nerve!

1898
02:01:41,587 --> 02:01:44,215
A letter from
the Diogenes Club.

1899
02:01:44,256 --> 02:01:46,315
Maybe Mycroft is putting
you up for membership!

1900
02:01:46,359 --> 02:01:48,156
If only to have
the distinct pleasure...

1901
02:01:48,194 --> 02:01:49,786
of blackballing his brother.

1902
02:02:09,548 --> 02:02:11,188
Aren't you going
to finish your breakfast?

1903
02:03:06,639 --> 02:03:08,266
Holmes, I'm terribly
sorry about this.

1904
02:03:11,877 --> 02:03:13,071
Where is it, Watson?

1905
02:03:15,714 --> 02:03:19,912
In the files. May to July, 1885.

1906
02:03:34,333 --> 02:03:35,960
You're getting better.

1906
02:03:36,305 --> 02:04:36,262
