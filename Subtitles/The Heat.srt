<i>Hey!</i>

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,643

00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,807

<i>You gotta fight
the powers that be</i>

7
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,003
<i>Got so many forces</i>

8

00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,570

00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,842

00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,809
<i>They say my music's too loud</i>

13
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,609
<i>I tried talkin' about it</i>

14
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,444
<i>I got the big run around</i>

15
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,443
<i>And when I rolled
with the punches</i>

16
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,284
<i>I got knocked on the ground</i>

17
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,170
<i>By all this bullshit going down</i>

18
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,687
<i>Hey!</i>

19
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,841
<i>Time is truly wastin'</i>

20

<i>We gotta fight

23
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,886
Huh?

24
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,928
Oh, my God.
It means cover me, go left.

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,889
Read the manual, why don't you?

26
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,723
Wait for my three count.

27
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,565
One... two...

28
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,811
Unbelievable.

29
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,325
FBI! Freeze!

30
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,882
Hands on top of your head!
On your head!

31
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,891
Surprise.

32
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,766
We've checked everywhere.
There's nothing.

33
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,766
Place is clean, Ashburn.
Looks like your...

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,844
...theory has a few holes in it.
Let's roll, boys.

35
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,288
So you think it's clean, huh?
Oh, here we go.

36
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,363
That's what they said last year

37
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,602
right before I arrested
the Red Falls Killer.

38
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,366
What are those?
Barbecued spare ribs?

39
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,001
Is that what that is?

40
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,726
I don't know,
maybe I'm wrong. Or...

41
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,091
...maybe I'm not.

42
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,766
Yeah. Airtight.
Dipped in wax.

43
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,411
I respect that.

44
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,325
I especially like the meat
to distract the dog.

45
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,287
And while that may have fooled the
loudest breather in the world...

46
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,085
...it did not fool me.

47
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,402
And unfortunately it's not
what I'm looking for.

48
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,444
So let's just cut to the chase.
Are there guns in the house?

49
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,130
I don't know anything
about any guns.

50
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,966
Interesting.

51
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,284
Maybe I'm wrong... you know?

52
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,441
Wait for it.

53
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,364
Maybe these guys
are right for a change.

54
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,647
Stranger things
have happened, right?

55
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,848
- That's a trap.
- Meteors, comets...

56
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,607
Somebody married Pete and he
can't even count to three.

57
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,801
See? Right there.

58
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,286
Oh, so frustrating.

59
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,009
You know, they loved these houses
during the prohibition era.

60
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,360
You guys know what
prohibition is, don't you?

61
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,642
Yeah, selling your ass
for money?

62
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,162
Really?

63
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,811
No, it was alcohol.

64
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,167
People loved to drink it, even
though they weren't supposed to.

65
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,765
And these houses
had all these nooks

66
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,800
and crannies where they could hide it.

67
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,285
Like this one.

68
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,649
Is there something behind me?
There is, isn't there?

69
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,321
Fuck.

70
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,650
Now you can roll.

71
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,487
Gentlemen.

72
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,406
Nice work, dick.

73
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,801
Let's go!

74
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,164
Hard to believe she's single.

75
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,483
<i>Immediately below that,
you feel a little crease...</i>

76
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,728
Wow, that's pretty impressive, huh?

77
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,684
Do you see that?
Look at that.

78
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,889
<i>Make an incision
right through there.</i>

79
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,480
That's pretty amazing, huh?

80
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,525
Pretty amazing.

81
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,041
Pumpkin!

82
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,725
Here, kitty, kitty!

83
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,049
Are you at
the neighbor's again?

84
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,605
Pumpkin!

85
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,891
Here, kitty, kitty!

86
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,602
Go on home. I'll see you tomorrow.

87
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,365
There you go.

88
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,531
Pumpkin, I told you to stay
away from that weird lady.

89
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,170
Oh, boy. Wife doesn't like
you working late, huh?

90
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,884
What do you want?

91
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,606
Oh, just letting you know that I
have been observing the agents.

92
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,125
Overseeing what
they've been up to,

93
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,929
you know...
keeping an eye on them.

94
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,570
Yeah. Supervising.

95
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,410
Supervising. Yes, sir.

96
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,806
Look, Ashburn.

97
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,928
I haven't made
any decisions yet.

98
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,289
Oh, of course not.
Everyone deserves a shot.

99
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,644
I don't know if you are the
right person for this position.

100
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,241
I'm sorry, what?
I'm confused.

101
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,527
Walk with me.

102
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:22,924
I've closed more cases than any agent here.
Should I not have done that?

103
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:26,607
You are a solid agent. There
are many other solid agents.

104
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,644
None of them have closed
the Red Falls Killer case.

105
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,770
Ashburn, it's no secret that none
of the other agents like you.

106
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,961
What?

107
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,571
I've gotten
countless complaints

108
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,484
of arrogance and competitiveness.
..showmanship.

109
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,165
Just give it a rest.

110
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:44,085
All right. We've got
a situation in Boston.

111
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,491
The Feds picked up chatter
on a guy moving in.

112
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,091
Simon Larkin.

113
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:53,280
We don't know what he looks like,
where he comes from, nothing.

114
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,847
We believe this guy is
doing the legwork for him.

115
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,321
Julian Vincent.
Nasty son of a bitch.

116
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,330
Murder. Extortion.

117
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,130
This is his M.O.

118
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,803
The problem with
guys like that is...

119
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,644
...everyone's
too scared to talk.

120
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,968
Pack your bags.
I'm sending you to Boston.

121
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,963
You know how to get
inside people's heads.

122
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,009
You want to find Larkin,
get to Julian.

123
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,806
You do well with this,
we can talk about the job.

124
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,571
<i>Whoo!</i>

125
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,684
<i>She's got stickers
on her locker</i>

126
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,880
<i>And the boys' numbers there
in magic marker</i>

127
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,962
<i>I'm hungry and
the hunger will linger</i>

128
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:34,250
<i>I eat sixteen saltine crackers
then I lick my fingers</i>

129
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,364
<i>Well, every morning
I deliver the news...</i>

130
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,204
Hey, Rojas sent me over.
He said you were really nice.

131
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,885
Yeah, what you looking for?

132
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,087
What's your name?

133
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,400
Champaz. What's yours?

134
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,561
Champaz?

135
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,881
Did your mom
give you that name?

136
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,081
Not exactly.

137
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,010
<i>Hey, Mullins. Captain
wants to know when you're coming in.</i>

138
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,567
You know what? Tell him I'll be there
sharply at go-fuck-yourself o'clock.

139
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,406
Okay? If there's no traffic.
Thank you.

140
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,724
That seems kind of expensive.
Expensive?

141
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,524
Can you break a hundred?

142
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,204
No, I'm not gonna
break a hundred.

143
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,404
I don't think I have that.
Do you have a discount?

144
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,203
What's going on here?

145
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,686
Okay, I don't want any drugs.
All right? Oh!

146
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,321
How you doing?

147
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,767
Are you trying to get a
deal on my girl here?

148
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,046
Are you her pimp?

149
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,565
No, we're just friends.

150
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,530
Well, I think this is just
between her and I, so...

151
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,171
Am I invading your space here?

152
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,287
Kind of.

153
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,727
I don't want to do that. Let
me see if this'll help you.

154
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,731
I just want to...

155
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,961
Oh!

156
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,443
It's a good thing I didn't
get the drugs from you.

157
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,689
Yeah, can you imagine that?

158
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,571
That would have been crazy.

159
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,971
That would have been bad.

160
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,963
That would have been bad!

161
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,001
Phew!

162
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,561
You'd better wipe that brow.

163
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:04,241
Listen, I gotta ask. Whatever... But
what was actually going on here?

164
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,891
We were just...

165
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:11,725
She looked kind of sad, so I thought I'd
help her out and give her a ride home.

166
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,928
That's nice, like a good Samaritan.
Yeah.

167
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,401
Are you depressed? Was he
giving you a ride home?

168
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,562
Yeah, I was cheering you up.
Yeah, good for you.

169
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,722
You know who else is pretty sad?
Frank over here.

170
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,644
Right, Frank? You get sad 'cause
you shit and piss yourself?

171
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,721
You having a sad day, Frank?

172
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,211
Hey, maybe you can put him
in the back of your car.

173
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,090
You want to shit and piss
all over this guy's car?

174
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,446
Let's open up the...

175
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,970
Frank, you wanna shit your pants and get in the...
Oh, Good, it's open.

176
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,565
I can put Frank in there.

177
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,211
He can shit and piss
himself until he's happy.

178
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,851
I got some towels...
Does that sound good?

179
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,361
Why don't you let me
see your I.D.?

180
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,447
Oh, come on, please?

181
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,330
Let me take the whole thing.

182
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,010
I don't...
It's good, I got it.

183
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,811
Oh, good.

184
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,088
I got nervous that
maybe you didn't have

185
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,162
a wife and a whole
bunch of kids, but...

186
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,727
...luckily you do.
What's your wife's name?

187
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,961
Bella.

188
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,804
Oh, Bella. Good.

189
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,802
Hey, can I borrow your phone for a minute?
My battery's out.

190
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,411
Why do you want
to borrow my phone?

191
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,845
Because I asked
you for your phone.

192
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,327
Give me your fucking phone.
Shut your mouth.

193
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,247
Can you give me one chance here?

194
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,408
Yeah, I'll give you one chance.

195
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,244
Yeah, who's this? Is this Bella?

196
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,401
No, no, no!

197
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,090
Don't do that. Don't do that.

198
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,646
This is Officer Mullins.
I'm here with your husband.

199
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,882
God! What are you, Spock?

200
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,966
No, he's not been in an
accident, unfortunately.

201
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,122
I do have him here
with a known prostitute.

202
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,806
She's lying!
Bella, she's lying!

203
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,043
Oh, that's not
the first time, huh?

204
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,802
Yeah, that's him. He's crying because
I'm breaking his fucking hand.

205
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,565
Oh, she said do it harder.

206
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,404
Ow! All right, Bella.
That's for Bella.

207
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,167
You got to go with
your instincts, Bella.

208
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,490
You're welcome.

209
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,807
She's probably gonna
burn your shit today.

210
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,445
You don't understand.

211
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,647
She just had a baby.

212
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,649
There's a lot going on down there.
I'm not gonna touch that!

213
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,968
Why don't you take
your seatbelt off?

214
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,121
Come on, please.

215
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,965
You seem reasonable.
Take your fucking belt off.

216
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,610
You look like you
got some compassion.

217
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,962
I love the sound
of a guy that...

218
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,925
...after his wife gives him
his fifth fucking child,

219
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,968
complains about
her messy vagina.

220
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,322
And then you don't want
to fucking touch her?

221
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,090
I can unlock the door!

222
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,367
Get out of the fucking car!

223
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,801
Get out of the fucking car!

224
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,166
Are you kidding me?

225
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,363
Get up against the car.
What is your problem?

226
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,286
You want to do that?

227
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,600
It's hot! The car is hot!

228
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,286
Good! I hope it burns
your fucking dick off.

229
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,490
Hey, it's Rojas!
My favorite asshole.

230
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,205
Look what I found.

231
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,529
Did I take some of your business away?
That's a shame.

232
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,441
I don't know what you're talking about.
I just stand on this corner...

233
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,005
...and do my sodukas, okay?

234
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,321
Oh, is that right? First of
all, it's sudoku, dumb-ass.

235
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,491
And you want to tell me that
you're just here coincidentally?

236
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,569
Right in the middle
of all the prostitutes?

237
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,722
Lady, why are you
so obsessed with me?

238
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,881
You should be ashamed,

239
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,651
trying to break down a successful
black man. You racist?

240
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,121
Don't play that race
bullshit card with me!

241
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,721
Nine out of ten guys
I fuck are black guys!

242
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,965
Lady, what you need to do is go down
the road, take a vacation, okay?

243
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,562
And go get your groove back.
Lady, just relax. Chill. Okay?

244
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,401
What is that?

245
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,407
Take off.

246
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,241
That's what I thought.

247
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,289
I'm not a part of this!

248
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,044
Shut up! Shut up!

249
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,926
Oh, my God!

250
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,685
Oh, it's on.

251
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,921
She's crazy!

252
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,726
Come on, please let me out. I
get really carsick.

253
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,763
Oh, no, that's terrible!

254
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,082
I got him now.
I got him!

255
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,930
You are a meth head!

256
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,566
Oh, my God!

257
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,125
Hey, look who's here!

258
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,125
Yeah, you better run!

259
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,406
Oh, shit.

260
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,644
I got him! I got him!

261
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,121
You piece of shit, I said stop!

262
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,090
I said stop!

263
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,521
I said stop!

264
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,806
You're crushing my balls!

265
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,644
I hope they fucking rupture!

266
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,844
Lady, get the fuck off me! What
the hell is wrong with you?

267
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,007
Bella, I'm sorry!

268
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,442
Let me go! Hold still,
you piece of shit!

269
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,325
My leg, lady! Let me go!

270
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,965
What is wrong with you?

271
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,169
I'll tell you what's the matter with me!
It's you, piece of shit!

272
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,171
Son of a bitch!

273
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,805
Stop moving!

274
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,325
Leave me alone!

275
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,568
Get off me! Get off me!

276
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,966
Shit. Oh!

277
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,801
Yeah.

278
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,805
What the hell did
you throw at me?

279
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,047
A watermelon.

280
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,360
A watermelon?

281
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,682
Aw, hell, no! See, I told
you you was a racist.

282
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,880
I tried to hit you with my car.
What's that make me?

283
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,526
Let's see what you got in...
Oh, look at this!

284
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,450
Look at this.
Not even my birthday.

285
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,170
Hey, you planted
that shit on me!

286
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,810
Yeah, I planted it.
I'm innocent!

287
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,760
Shut up before I feed you watermelon.
Get up!

288
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,041
Levy?

289
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,242
Federal Agent Sarah Ashburn
from the New York field office.

290
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,327
Hi, how are you?

291
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,767
I need all your files on all
known drug dealers of the area.

292
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,729
Right. We heard
you were coming.

293
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,370
Actually, I was expecting it.

294
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,881
I'll show you to your desk.

295
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,360
Not necessary.
I won't be here long.

296
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,210
I can carry these.
Thank you.

297
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,609
Whoa! Hey! Ashburn!

298
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,887
Oh!
Oh, God!

299
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,365
You okay?
What is it?

300
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,285
Low-end dealer just brought
into the East Boston precinct.

301
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,930
Name's Terrell Rojas.

302
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,563
Oh. Oh, okay.

303
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,722
Good. Thank you very much.
Good luck out there.

304
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,680
It's not about luck, pal.
Not about luck.

305
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,081
Wow.

306
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,449
That was almost cool.

307
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,163
Almost.

308
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,682
Come on, come on.

309
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,962
Ain't gonna fucking park today?

310
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,760
All right.
Here we go. Finally.

311
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,205
I'm moving in there!

312
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,441
No, don't...

313
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,205
Hey, hey!
No, get back in your car!

314
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,886
Hey, asshole!

315
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,125
Goddamn it!

316
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,965
Hey, you need to sign in.

317
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,131
Captain Woods?

318
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,286
Captain Woods?

319
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,169
Christ.
I'm sorry?

320
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,130
Uh... How can I help you?

321
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,130
Special Agent Sarah Ashburn.

322
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,884
We got intel recently
that you brought in

323
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,530
a dealer by the name
of Terrell Rojas.

324
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,842
Yeah, but Detective Mullins
isn't back from lunch yet.

325
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,560
I'm sure he won't mind.

326
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,327
He's a she, and we're not
allowed to go near her collars.

327
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,971
Let me tell you what I think.

328
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,480
Every second
we're standing here

329
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,885
is interfering with
the federal investigation.

330
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,162
So if you'd be so kind
as to show Mr. Rojas

331
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,004
to an interrogation room.
Thank you.

332
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,045
Special Agent?

333
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,331
This way.

334
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,005
Special Agent.

335
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,330
Special Agent.

336
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,680
Shit.

337
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,011
You are looking at
possession with intent...

338
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:02,046
...which is a class D drug charge,
chapter 94C, section 32A.

339
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,288
I had a joint and a few
little bags of coke.

340
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,600
Since when is
that shit illegal?

341
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,603
The answer to your
question is always.

342
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,370
And with your priors...

343
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,047
...you are looking at 25 years
and some pretty stiff fines.

344
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,045
Who the hell cares about fines?
That's 25 years!

345
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,523
Never mind. Let's see
what you make of these.

346
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,725
What I make of them...

347
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:25,282
...is that somebody doesn't want
somebody else selling on their turf.

348
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:29,043
But you're still here... and you're alive.
Why is that?

349
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,725
Who you working for?
Nobody.

350
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,961
Who you working for?
Nobody.

351
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,121
Who you working for?
Nobody!

352
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,804
If I tell you,
that's my ass chopped up

353
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,405
into a million
motherfucking pieces!

354
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,485
Goddamn it.

355
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,205
Fucker.

356
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,569
God. Puss!

357
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,042
Motherfucker!

358
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,044
Everybody's got to fucking
park in my spot. Goddamn it!

359
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,082
Shit! Suit-wearing, god...

360
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,244
Ow, fuck!

361
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,928
I said I'm fucking parking there!

362
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,561
Steal my goddamn fucking space!

363
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,041
I don't want you to do time.

364
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,291
I don't want you to get chopped
up into little, tiny...

365
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,963
...mother-F-ing pieces. Oh.

366
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,602
I can protect you. I can.
But you've got to help me.

367
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,921
I can help you.

368
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,770
You'll help me?
Yeah.

369
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,285
Where can I find Julian?

370
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,411
I get my stuff from this bitch
named Tatiana on Newkirk Avenue.

371
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,971
Can you describe her?

372
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,930
She got brown eyes.

373
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,603
She got some
big-ass breastses.

374
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,085
Big breastses.
Okay.

375
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,523
Can you maybe be a little
bit more specific?

376
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,726
Her breastses is like this.

377
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,605
Okay. Thank you.

378
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,564
That's a shame.

379
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,881
Don't.

380
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,005
Oh! Ha-ha! Oh, yeah!
We're at a comedy party!

381
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,726
Move the fuck out of my way.
Get a room.

382
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,003
Tim, you still owe me $40.

383
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,244
Yeah, tomorrow it's $60!
Fucking dickweed.

384
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,164
Why is the cage empty?

385
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,767
What did I tell you
about moving my prisoners?

386
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,331
He's in interrogation.

387
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,804
Why would he be in interrogation
when I'm standing right here?

388
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,247
They came and got him.

389
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,367
Who's "they"?

390
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,562
It better be two of me.
Is it two of me?

391
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,767
It was a lady.

392
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,285
I'm a lady.
Did I come and get him?

393
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,482
No, it was a different lady.
She was nice.

394
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,882
I'm fucking nice.
Why was she nice to you?

395
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,485
She made me give her the keys.

396
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,722
I'm gonna make you
fucking bend over...

397
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,962
...and I'm gonna reach up
your ass into your pocket

398
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,485
and get the keys to your house.

399
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,449
Then I'm gonna drive there...

400
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,762
...come in your front door
and kill you in your sleep.

401
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,407
I think I have a clear idea
of what we're looking for,

402
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,720
and I appreciate your time.

403
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,649
Wow, lady, you're on
a real fucking roll.

404
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,887
Excuse me?

405
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,246
No, I won't excuse you.

406
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,971
I just spent the last 30 minutes
thinking of ways to kill you.

407
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,083
I'm sorry, when did we meet?

408
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,321
Is this your lawyer?

409
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,086
Are you an insurance salesman?
Do you sell those shitty suits?

410
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,766
I'm Special Agent Sarah Ashburn.
How can I help you?

411
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,930
You can get all of that
and get the fuck out of here.

412
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,081
This is my room

413
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,322
Were you about to be
questioned by a detective?

414
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,285
I am a detective
and that's my perp.

415
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,728
Ah! I understand now.

416
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,044
Detective, Mr. Rojas will
be continuing on with me.

417
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,483
No.
It's a jurisdictional issue.

418
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,766
Not gonna happen.

419
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,410
Your efforts are duly noted.

420
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,527
Oh, great.

421
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,171
And if you're okay with
everything, could you just...

422
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,402
...close the door on the way out?
I'll shut the door on you.

423
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,130
Will you lay down and put
your head in the door?

424
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,329
I'll slam it
about 157,000 times.

425
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,925
Aw, shit, girl, you better run.

426
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,923
Shut your mouth.
Run like you on fire.

427
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,161
Be quiet.

428
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,322
Get up and we'll
settle this outside.

429
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,164
I won't be going outside.

430
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,687
You're gonna get up
and come outside.

431
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,921
No, ma'am.

432
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,764
Fine. We'll do this inside.

433
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,129
Can somebody remove this person
from the interrogation room?

434
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,563
Mental illness is nothing to be ashamed of.
It runs in many families.

435
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,767
I'm gonna hit you.

436
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,046
You're not. Please don't.

437
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,402
I'm gonna hit you and knock
all your little buttons.

438
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,607
I'm gonna hit you there,
or here...

439
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,806
Do not put your finger in...

440
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,166
Stop touching my buttons!

441
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,321
Stop wearing buttons.

442
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,642
Don't move those
fucking hands at me.

443
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,450
I'll get that stupid barrette!

444
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,443
I'll take that barrette right
out of your fucking hair!

445
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,489
Stop, stop, stop!

446
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,366
Both of you... my office now.

447
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,764
Nope. Not in there.

448
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:31,322
There is nothing I can do, Mullins.
The FBI has jurisdiction.

449
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,250
Maybe they're in here.

450
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,846
Stop. Will you stop?

451
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,046
Nope, they're not in there.

452
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,851
What is she doing?

453
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,443
She's looking for my balls.

454
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,042
Hey, if anyone sees
the Captain's balls...

455
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,923
...let me know. They're about
this big, but a lot tinier.

456
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,443
They're like a pea... or
like a ball bearing.

457
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:54,287
Or if you've ever seen a mouse
ball, about half that size.

458
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,126
Incredibly tiny. They're
like really, really tiny...

459
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,886
...little girl balls.
If little girls had balls.

460
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,806
So if you find little,
tiny girl balls...

461
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,924
...that are so fucking
tiny and shriveled up...

462
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,244
...let me know, because I'll put
them right back up his scrotum!

463
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,686
Knock it off.

464
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,604
How about you do
something for once?

465
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,000
What do you want me to do?

466
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,321
Have my back

467
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,846
and stop being so goddamn
disappointing like everybody else!

468
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,331
Well, that was professional.

469
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,090
Was that not professional?
Here.

470
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,891
Let me be professional. Let
me help you pick up your bag.

471
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,121
That's very mature.

472
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,761
Let me just
straighten that shit up.

473
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,565
Oh, wait, hey!

474
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,166
Good news! Good news,
I found his balls!

475
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:37,405
In a clear sack! Yeah, enjoy that.
Shove those back up there.

476
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,565
Cop of the year!

477
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,410
Keep it up!

478
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,324
This job is destroying me.

479
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,120
You know how old I am?

480
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,846
58?

481
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,163
I'm 43 years old.

482
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,606
Mmm-hmm.

483
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,330
Well, I always round up.

484
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,131
I have a five-year-old son
who calls me grandpa!

485
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:01,603
So, uh... anyhoo, sir...

486
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,367
...if you could
just... you know...

487
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,161
...keep her... away from me...

488
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,841
...that would
be... very helpful.

489
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,880
She stole your keys,
didn't she?

490
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,202
Yes, she did. Do you know
where I can find her?

491
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:17,125
She's probably at O'Flanagan's.
It's a bar down the street.

492
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,726
It's a little divey. You
might want to wear a vest.

493
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,649
<i>Okay I'm Rambo I ramshack</i>

494
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,404
<i>I'm next to that cheese
like rat traps</i>

495
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,005
<i>On top of that green
like grass ass</i>

496
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,445
<i>That's over y'all head
like snapbacks</i>

497
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,280
<i>I get it where I fit in,
put up then I put in</i>

498
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,924
<i>Tryna find an ass
I can put my fucking foot in</i>

499
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,161
<i>Run this shit,
no, I run this shit</i>

500
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,041
<i>Don't give one fuck, bitch
I done this shit...</i>

501
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:40,164
Sir, is this place open?
Is there a door... Oh.

502
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:45,602
So there is. Could you point
it out to me with your finger?

503
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,524
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

504
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,125
Hand them over.
Give me the keys. Now.

505
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,441
Oh, my God.

506
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,125
Did you drop something?

507
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,366
I apologize.

508
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,121
You are so concerned about
taking down a guy like Rojas...

509
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,525
...wasting all this time

510
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,280
when I could have stopped a drug
lord who is far more dangerous...

511
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,442
...and supplies to
people like Rojas.

512
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,563
Bullshit. Who?

513
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,329
Okay, you want to
see some bull feces?

514
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,249
I think I said "bullshit".

515
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,727
Here's some bull poo-poo.
How does that look?

516
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,327
See that? Oh, come on.
I got a kid here.

517
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,641
Oh, I'm so sorry.

518
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,086
I'm very, very sorry.

519
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,601
Wait a minute, this is a bar.

520
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,207
No, absolutely not.
No, no, no, no.

521
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,402
Why do I not know
who Simon Larkin is?

522
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,325
That would probably be because
the FBI knows more than you do.

523
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,165
Anything happening in my
neighborhood I have a right to know.

524
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,324
No, you actually don't.
You want to know.

525
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,811
And you do not
have the clearance

526
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,168
that would allow you to read
everything that is in this file.

527
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,521
Okay, all right!

528
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,247
When bad shit happens
in my neighborhood,

529
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,561
I get a little
passionate about it.

530
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,725
I shouldn't have read your files.
I went too far.

531
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,082
Well, I accept your apology.

532
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,803
But you need to understand that
this is a highly important case.

533
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,850
And the information is
highly, highly sensitive.

534
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,331
Therefore we have
these clearances.

535
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:18,246
I don't have the clearances.
Right? I mean, you are...

536
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,722
You are, wow, FBI.

537
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:24,084
I mean, you are a goddamn
angel of the law.

538
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,044
Well, that's a little...

539
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,481
I want you to spread those
wings and just soar.

540
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,690
Watch it!

541
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,442
You watch it.
I'm a federal agent.

542
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,964
Oh, yeah? Well, guess what, you dick!
I'm a federal agent, too!

543
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,964
I work at the post office.

544
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:47,968
Well, I appreciate the work you do
for us on the ground. Thank you.

545
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,645
You bet your ass you do.

546
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,724
I see no one will be
getting their mail today!

547
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,121
Good burn.

548
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,482
Good burn. You got burned,
you big drunk paddy!

549
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,768
Kiss my cunt, you twat!

550
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,082
So we are good?

551
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,281
Thank you.
Thank you.

552
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,891
America thanks you.

553
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,206
And I it.

554
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,606
And it you.

555
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,041
Thank you.

556
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,446
Whoa!

557
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,124
Yes, okay.

558
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,801
Good day.

559
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,806
Dumbass.

560
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,684
<i>So how you been, Jason?</i>

561
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,844
You want to talk
about Simon Larkin?

562
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,525
I never heard of him.

563
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,920
Don't lie to me.

564
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,082
You're my brother,
I know when you're lying.

565
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,487
I'm just a low-level guy.

566
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,286
I heard of Larkin
but I never met him.

567
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,922
He's a goddamn animal, and I'm
trying to keep him from meeting you.

568
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,084
You gonna storm through Boston
and take down a drug lord?

569
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,771
Yeah, I might.

570
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,650
Have you met me?

571
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,281
Yeah, unfortunately.

572
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,490
Yeah, shut up.

573
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,484
Look, I get out tomorrow.

574
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,166
I'm coming home.
I'm gonna be fine.

575
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,004
I promise, all right?

576
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:17,091
Oh! Never approach me if
I'm not expecting you!

577
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,090
What are you, an animal?

578
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,646
You said you would
stay off my case,

579
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,361
and now I find you in front
of Tatiana's apartment.

580
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,727
I live here.

581
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,521
Oh, that's hilarious.
You know what's not funny?

582
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,087
That you stole a
confidential FBI case file.

583
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,044
I don't remember any of that.

584
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,443
I'm going to say it one more time.
Stand down, Officer.

585
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,006
Fuck off, Officer.

586
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,845
Oh, okay, now you've really done it.
I'm going to call my boss.

587
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,441
Yeah, you do that, tattle tits!

588
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,441
Fucking narc!

589
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,802
Unbelievable. Unbelievable.

590
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,248
<i>It's Ashburn, sir.
I need authorization...</i>

591
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,683
...to suspend a police officer
from my investigation.

592
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,884
Ashburn, why is working with local
authorities a problem for you?

593
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,041
<i>Sir, it's not.</i>

594
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,971
I understand how this might
sound coming from me...

595
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,006
...but I think this individual might
actually be mentally unstable.

596
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,527
Her captain says she
grew up on those streets

597
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,601
and knows them
better than anyone.

598
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,563
That seems like an asset
to our investigation.

599
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,967
Sir, I...

600
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,326
No, just work with her.

601
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,006
Show me you can do this
or forget the promotion.

602
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:28,245
Well, sir, no need to take someone's badge.
I think I can, uh...

603
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,842
I think I can work
something out, sir.

604
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,844
All right. Thank you.

605
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,090
You know, uh...

606
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,850
I just...

607
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,287
I think you and I got off
on the wrong foot.

608
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,521
Oh!

609
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,602
I don't know Boston,
and you obviously have...

610
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,843
...a lot of resources and a lot of
knowledge about the area that could be,

611
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,445
you know, useful.

612
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,364
Probably very.
So, uh...

613
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,364
...maybe we can work
together on this.

614
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,046
I don't need your help
to take down Larkin.

615
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,726
You wouldn't even have known
about Larkin if not for me.

616
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,161
So obviously the FBI can
get information you can't.

617
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,529
And there's a lot more
where that comes from. A lot!

618
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:07,684
Maybe I just need to hear a little
"I need your help, Mullins."

619
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,171
I won't be doing that.

620
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,163
Okay, then get your
ass back in your car.

621
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,685
This is ridiculous.

622
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,002
I'm an FBI agent.
You're a police officer.

623
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,844
"I need your help, Mullins."

624
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,845
I need your help, Mullins.

625
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:23,483
What is this, a whisper party? I
want that third floor to hear it.

626
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:28,170
"I need your help, Mullins." Then
give me a little echo on "Mullins".

627
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:36,049
I need your help, Mullins,
Mullins, Mullins...

628
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,884
Just move. Move, move!

629
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,640
God! Even in that,
you're annoying.

630
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,649
I will work with you...

631
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,161
...as long as we're clear
that this is my case.

632
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,442
That's actually
not... correct.

633
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,682
Awesome.
Glad you see it my way.

634
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,251
Careful of the car.

635
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,801
Goddamn it.

636
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,403
Stand down.
I got it.

637
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,483
If you just let go...
I got it.

638
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,846
I have it, just let me...

639
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,126
I've got it.

640
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,931
I got it.

641
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,604
Oh, shit!

642
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,767
Ma'am, you, uh...

643
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,609
Just go. Just go.

644
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,767
Let me take the lead on this.
I'm a trained interviewer.

645
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,241
"Interviewer?" What are
you, Barbara Walters?

646
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,085
I thought we'd go in there and
bring in some heat on her.

647
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,242
I'm sorry, what does
that even mean?

648
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,925
Me and you, we're the heat.

649
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,686
We go in there, interrogate her,
scare the shit out of her...

650
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,922
We don't say "interrogation".
It's too aggressive.

651
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,321
Rule number one, catch more
with sugar than with a stick.

652
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,930
That's a horrible
fucking saying.

653
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:48,289
We like to create a genuine
personal interest in the subject,

654
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,401
allowing them to open up.

655
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,484
Then I'll perform instant
personality assessments

656
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,971
based on
the Myers-Briggs theory...

657
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,362
...Thematic
Apperception Tests and...

658
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,726
...a few others I
won't bore you with.

659
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,371
Well, I am balls deep
in boredom.

660
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,165
All right, as long as
you don't do that

661
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,651
whole long explanation again...

662
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,490
...we'll try it
your way first.

663
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,006
Only because you're older.

664
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,320
Oh, my God.

665
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,080
Tatiana Krumova, I am Special
Agent Sarah Ashburn...

666
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,607
...and this is Detective Mullins.
Detective Mullins.

667
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,529
And we'd like to ask you a few questions
if you could give us a moment.

668
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:28,322
Oh, shoot. You know, now is bad.
I'm making butter.

669
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,051
How about other time?

670
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,360
If you could just give... How
about right fucking now?

671
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,164
Right fucking now!

672
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,165
Well, Tatiana, thank you.
This is very kind of you.

673
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,561
So...

674
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,842
How long have you lived here?

675
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,043
I've lived here
since I moved in.

676
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,085
Okay, that's
very... very helpful.

677
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,562
Okay, we'll get
a little more specific.

678
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,843
What do you do for a living?

679
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,365
I know what this asshole
does for a living.

680
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,680
What you know, asshole?

681
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,001
Sugar, no stick.

682
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,924
It is Bulgarian, is it not?

683
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,605
No, I'm fucking French!

684
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,444
Oh, Jesus.
Tatiana...

685
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,210
I don't understand
what you are saying.

686
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,846
Nice bullshit Bulgarian.

687
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,410
That was perfect Bulgarian.

688
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,409
I mean I don't understand
what you are talking about!

689
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,847
Why I go to jail
when I don't do shits?

690
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:18,966
Ah! So she did understand what I
was saying, just not the context.

691
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,491
Oh, sweet God.

692
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,087
All right, Rosetta Stone,
you're done.

693
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,005
Ugh! Oh, Jesus.

694
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,523
How many porns have been
made on this couch?

695
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,286
Oh, this couch not of your satisfaction?
You're not comfy?

696
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,442
I'll get comfy. When
my foot's up your ass.

697
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,521
Wow.

698
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,648
That'll make me really comfy.
Don't poke me!

699
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,802
Tatiana, I want to
get really real.

700
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,122
You ready to get real?
Let's get real.

701
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,847
Okay, we both know you've been
blowing shit up your nose all day.

702
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,446
Man, I get it. There's nothing
more I'd love to do than...

703
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,683
...slip into my camisole, put my
feet up, have a little smack.

704
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,928
Real good time,
maybe a couple cold ones,

705
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,048
a little chip and dip,
watch some cartoons.

706
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,203
I'd get a big bowl of coke...

707
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,761
I'd put my face in it, cut
it with a little Ritalin...

708
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,604
Heaven on fucking earth, right?
Sure.

709
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,967
I'd camp out all week
for tickets to that show.

710
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,400
What is this, <i>Training Day?</i>

711
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,926
All fucking week
I'd camp out for that!

712
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,363
But you, you piece of shit, you've
been rolling deep for a long time.

713
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,364
And now it's time you open
up that goddamn mouth

714
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,760
and tell us what
we want to know.

715
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:19,163
You got good point. I tell you what.
I open my mouth.

716
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,528
You get the fuck
out my house now!

717
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,330
How's that for open mouth?

718
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,965
Fuck out! Get fuck out!

719
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,530
Yeah, I'll get the fuck out.

720
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,921
All right.

721
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,926
You should really stop smoking
because it's an awfully bad habit.

722
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,080
You're leaving half your
lipstick in the ashtray.

723
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:38,370
I had a great aunt that lost
most of her teeth to smoking.

724
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,641
Good to know.

725
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,167
A lot of fistfights,
too, but mostly smoking.

726
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,641
We're gonna get
out of your hair.

727
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,887
That is not front door.

728
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,364
Put your hands
where I can see 'em!

729
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,521
Don't fucking move.

730
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,088
Is this your drug mule?
Oh, my gosh!

731
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,200
That's my mother!

732
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,123
Do you have balloons
of horse up your ass?

733
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,441
You break my fucking door!

734
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,806
Stand down, Officer.

735
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,769
Who closes the door
to take a shit?

736
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,805
Humans do.

737
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,645
Don't touch underpants!

738
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,127
Get out, bull in china shop!
Out of my house!

739
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,526
What the fuck's wrong with you?

740
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:11,124
Wow, you are just
all stick and no sugar.

741
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,811
Did you get
the cigarette or not?

742
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:17,120
Uh, yeah... of course I did.

743
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,481
Yeah.

744
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:23,247
I snagged these matches, too. I think
our guy likes to go to Club Ekko.

745
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,331
Really?
Yes, really.

746
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,604
Let's find out, shall we?

747
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,009
Hang on. The couch was disgusting.
I need to wash my hands.

748
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,843
Wait a minute,
you do live here?

749
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,645
That's what I said.

750
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,366
Oh.

751
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:45,203
Wow, your windows
are all boarded up.

752
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,361
Yeah, I've got the glass,

753
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,801
I just don't have the...
you know, window blankets.

754
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,002
The curtains?
You mean the curtains?

755
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,083
Whatever. Okay?

756
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,205
That's just my family.

757
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,401
Oh.

758
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,482
Yeah, it's sweet.

759
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,847
You want something to eat?

760
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,361
I didn't finish my submarine
sandwich the other day.

761
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,051
No, thank you.

762
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:12,011
Sorry I don't have poached
eggs in rubies for you.

763
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,483
No, I don't mean
to be rude, but...

764
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,844
...one could catch a MRSA
infection in here, that's all.

765
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,570
What part of that wasn't rude?

766
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:23,491
Just for your own well-being.
For example, that door.

767
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,330
That door has no
way of locking.

768
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,164
Someone could barge in at any moment.
It's not safe.

769
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,322
No one's coming in here...

770
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,171
...because they know
I keep this fully stocked.

771
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,171
Oh, my God.

772
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,481
Yeah, I know.

773
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,403
A Marlin 1894CB?

774
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,409
Is that an FN PS90?

775
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,846
Yeah! Nice one.

776
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,490
You have all of this
in your house?

777
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,005
You didn't even
mention my baby.

778
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,531
Look at this.
Oh!

779
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,850
My little pride and joy.

780
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,291
This little beauty could
vaporize an above-ground pool.

781
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,249
If you didn't want
the pool anymore.

782
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,731
No kidding.
Pretty, huh?

783
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,400
Yeah. How do you refuse
that sales pitch, huh?

784
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,042
You don't.
Unless you're an asshole.

785
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,888
I haven't seen one of these
since World War II.

786
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,566
No! God,
that... occasionally ticks.

787
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,723
Put it back slowly.
Slowly!

788
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,929
Like half that speed.

789
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,204
Half that speed!

790
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,042
Stop shaking.
Put your pinky down.

791
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,326
I got it on eBay. It was supposed
to be bigger and different.

792
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,401
It doesn't matter.

793
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,801
I'm gonna "Bad Feedback"
his ass, though.

794
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:43,921
All right, ladies.

795
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,844
Here's the DNA results
from the book of matches

796
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,922
and the cigarette butt
you got from Tatiana's.

797
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:51,448
We pulled two sets of prints.
First one's a real nut job.

798
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,923
Look at this. Reckless
driving, assault, arson.

799
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,606
Oh, God.
Ahem! Really?

800
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,922
Who the fuck is this guy?
He's my assistant.

801
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,122
You know I'm an agent, right?
Arson?

802
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,850
It was a drug house!

803
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,844
I really feel the need
to finish reading your files.

804
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,684
I feel the need for you to
stay out of my business

805
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,364
so I don't punch
you in the teeth.

806
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,529
What did you find out
about the cigarette?

807
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,205
Okay. Hank LeSoire.

808
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,361
Local businessman.

809
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,442
Got tons of ties to the
drug world, black market...

810
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:20,484
...as well as prostitution rings.
Co-owner of Club Ekko.

811
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,849
It looks like we found our distributor.
Can you back that up, please?

812
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,490
Back up to which one?
That.

813
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,047
I'm not into you!

814
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,400
Your breast is
invading my space.

815
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,449
Keep your finger
out of my areola.

816
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,324
Contain your areola!

817
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,290
There. Now we're even.

818
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,805
He looks like a real Chatty Cathy.
Did you tap the phone?

819
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,721
I haven't been able to. Guy
gets a new prepaid every other week.

820
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,205
By the time I can
get his phone number

821
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,685
and hack in,
he's got a new one.

822
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:46,047
Let's get a bug into the
phone he does have.

823
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,326
I want to know what
he's saying this week.

824
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,681
Just get a court order and a bug.
We'll do it ourselves.

825
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,200
If you're gonna boss me around,
at least buy me dinner first.

826
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,243
No.
Okay. Cool.

827
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,209
I'll get that to you ASAP.

828
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,806
You got to work on your game.
That was weak.

829
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,361
What? I thought I
was being charming.

830
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:04,486
I don't know what to say to that.
Now I just feel bad for you.

831
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,527
Okay, so LeSoire
co-owns Club Ekko.

832
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:12,003
Let's start surveilling it and figure
out how to get a bug in his phone.

833
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,366
Tell me everything
you know about it.

834
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,720
It's just
a shitty club downtown.

835
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,330
I've never been inside,

836
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,006
but there's always a line of
awful people around the corner.

837
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,527
They've called P.D. a couple
times to break up fights.

838
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,170
Oh, shit.
What's wrong?

839
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:26,523
Just don't look. Don't look!
Act like we're talking.

840
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,607
Hey, Shannon.

841
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,681
Hey, Robin.

842
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,685
I really enjoyed our night together.
You just disappeared on me.

843
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,490
Yeah, I know.
I was there.

844
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,688
Can I take you to dinner,
or a movie, or something?

845
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:39,083
Do you not hear how pathetic
everything out of your mouth sounds?

846
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:42,050
There's a girl out there
for you, but it's not me.

847
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:45,329
Maybe it's her. Her lady business
is like an old dirty attic.

848
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,324
It's full of broken Christmas
lights and doll shoes and shit.

849
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,164
Why don't you
clean that out for her?

850
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:55,091
That's a
misrepresentation of my vagina.

851
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,724
Wow, what was that about?

852
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,208
You sleep with a guy one time and he
wants to marry you. Jesus Christ!

853
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,368
Yeah, I know what you mean.

854
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,205
Who was that?

855
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,771
My mom.

856
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,608
<i>Ortiz
settles in the batter's box.</i>

857
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,682
<i>Verlander with the pitch.
A ground ball...</i>

858
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,201
<i>...through the legs of Cabrera
into right field.</i>

859
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:25,041
<i>Pedroia is headed for second base.
He slides, and he is...</i>

860
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,321
How about I tell you

861
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,640
a little something
about myself?

862
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,290
Oh, God.
Let's see...

863
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,442
I went to undergrad at Yale.

864
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,766
I have been with the Bureau
for about twelve years.

865
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,565
Up for a promotion.

866
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,083
See, I caught
the Red Falls Killer.

867
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,283
I remember thinking
that guy was innocent.

868
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:46,883
He's been in jail for eleven months.
That would make me...

869
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:50,283
...a horrible person if what
you said was actually factual.

870
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,886
Well, you can just tell
the judge you fucked up.

871
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,447
I didn't. I did not F up.

872
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,165
Don't get your
panties in a wad.

873
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,287
They're not wadded.

874
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,769
I'm intuitive. I say what I feel.
I'm usually right.

875
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,122
Take it or leave it.
Oh, I did not know.

876
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:06,961
Okay.

877
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,011
There's our guy.

878
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,411
I see him as well.

879
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,804
<i>Well, Daft Punk
is playing at my house</i>

880
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,291
<i>My house</i>

881
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:31,841
<i>I'll show you the ropes, kid,
show you the ropes</i>

882
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,527
<i>I got a bus and a
trailer at my house</i>

883
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,886
<i>My house...</i>

884
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,163
There he is. Over there.

885
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,280
We got to get past
those bodyguards.

886
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,961
We won't have to,
because he'll come to us.

887
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,768
Excuse me!
Step aside, please!

888
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,321
All right.

889
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,131
This will go fast.

890
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,806
When I pull the alarm, the crowd
will head towards the two exits.

891
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,360
He will head toward
the nearest one,

892
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,811
which is northeast.
I will bump into him.

893
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,806
I will grab the cell, place the bug
in it, tell him he dropped the phone.

894
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,002
It's something I like
to call a "cop drop".

895
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:09,368
Yeah, I got it.
Okay... here we go.

896
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,207
My God, there are no wires
attached to this thing.

897
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,444
What is that? Gum?
Or is it Silly Putty?

898
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,644
Don't touch it!
It's a condom.

899
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,122
All right, he's on the move.

900
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,440
We got to get out there and shake our
asses like the rest of the foxes.

901
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:30,723
Oh, yes, dancing to get close to him.
Fantastic idea!

902
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,650
Jesus. Don't!

903
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,490
Don't do anything you're doing.

904
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,686
But he's over that way.

905
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,644
Let's just go find a bathroom.

906
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,766
I told you, I don't have
to use the bathroom!

907
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:43,764
Did I ask about your bathroom habits?
You are killing us out there.

908
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,526
You don't fit in! Take
off that fucking jacket.

909
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,170
This is a good jacket.

910
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,129
You look like you're
gonna set up a table

911
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,009
and do their taxes.
Take it off!

912
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,691
This is ridiculous.

913
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,091
Your shitty jacket?
My God!

914
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,931
Okay, jacket's off.
Jacket's off.

915
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,965
I can't watch whatever
process is about to happen.

916
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,525
Now unbutton your buttons.

917
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,091
I'm a federal agent!

918
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,844
I know, and you look like one.

919
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,691
You think you'll bump into him and
he won't think something's up?

920
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,281
Fine. How's that? Is that good?
Can we go?

921
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,284
No, I think it's getting worse.

922
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,204
My fear is I'm gonna
put you in a bikini

923
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,009
and you'll still look like
a fucking bank teller.

924
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,481
Do you have to
use that language?

925
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,330
I'm trying to make a point!

926
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,720
I'm saying your face

927
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,529
and whatever is underneath this

928
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,250
shitty outfit is
maybe not terrible.

929
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,682
I'll have you know I
dress appropriately.

930
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,042
I got it!
It's when this...

931
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,409
...your big flapping mouth, starts
running, and then you put...

932
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:39,967
...this getup on top of it, and it's just...
it's a boner killer.

933
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,969
I'm gonna help you.
What are you doing?

934
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,480
Now I just want you to shut up.

935
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:44,886
Oh, my God.

936
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,643
Oh, my God! I only brought
five of these to Boston!

937
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,570
I'll cut the other four.

938
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,889
God, that's terrible fabric!

939
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,690
Just get that off your wrist.

940
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,401
This one was of
my favorite ones.

941
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:59,051
Just take it off.
Take it off!

942
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,565
Okay, just give me a second!

943
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,162
Okay, I look like
I've been attacked.

944
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,925
That's not my fault.

945
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:09,162
Oh, it's my fault? Let
me even out the bottom.

946
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,846
Would you stop
carving up my clothes?

947
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:14,407
I'm making shorts!
Everybody likes shorts.

948
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,722
Jesus! Hold still!

949
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:21,209
That feels... awkward. Weird.
Don't touch that area.

950
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:24,204
Don't duck down, or you're
gonna suck my hand up there.

951
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,681
Will you stop
pulling my pants off?

952
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,684
Jesus!
What?

953
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,281
What are those?

954
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,444
What are those?
Stop it!

955
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,842
They're my Spanx. They
hold everything together.

956
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:38,887
Why? What's gonna
come popping out?

957
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,725
Nothing! It just keeps everything
where it's supposed to be.

958
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,450
Shit, like medically?

959
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:45,881
No, not medically.
Just to...

960
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,725
It just keeps it right
where it's supposed to be.

961
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,964
You got to vent that furnace.

962
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,840
That's a lot of
compression and heat.

963
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,082
It gets plenty of
ventilation, thank you.

964
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,003
My hand's a foot off
and it's on fire.

965
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,571
Then why don't you
cut them shorter

966
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,244
because no one can
see my cervix yet?

967
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,846
I'll cut them shorter. No, stop it!
We're finished.

968
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,321
Okay, let's do you now.

969
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,801
I don't need that!

970
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,287
What do you mean?

971
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:11,328
I put my sexuality
out through motion.

972
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:15,204
When this starts going, it's all...
You'll get it.

973
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,926
So I have to look like this and
you get to look like that?

974
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,924
I know, it's not fair.

975
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:21,601
We gotta tackle the helmet.

976
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,604
It's got a real style
memory, huh?

977
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,764
You gotta flip that shit over.

978
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,171
Bend over.
Why?

979
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,447
You look like Darth Vader.
Just flip it over.

980
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:34,691
God Almighty.

981
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:37,161
I gotta just finger tease
the shit out of this.

982
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:39,447
Wait. What?
I'm gonna finger tease it.

983
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:42,082
What is that?
What does that mean?

984
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:43,884
Not what you want it to mean.

985
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,281
Hit it!

986
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,411
What are you looking at?

987
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:57,285
I like how your friend's shorts
make me feel in my shorts.

988
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,125
I am sorry. That was much
cruder than I meant it to be.

989
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,166
I stand corrected on the shorts.
Let's proceed.

990
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,323
Oh, God, we're dead.

991
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:06,806
At one o'clock.

992
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:07,961
Let's do this.

993
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:09,881
All right.

994
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:13,242
Get in there.
Get in there.

995
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:16,089
How do you get in?
I don't know how.

996
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,286
Back it in.

997
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,921
Get in there. Get your hands
in and get the phone.

998
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:21,485
Okay, Pinky.

999
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,484
Do the cop drop.
I'm trying to!

1000
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,011
Do the fucking cop drop!

1001
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:26,684
I can't do it
from this position!

1002
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,762
No. No, no, no!

1003
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,681
Okay, coming in one more time.
Get her away.

1004
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,165
I got her! But
you're like a fucking nanny!

1005
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:39,203
Picture time!

1006
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:41,802
Damn it. Can somebody
get my phone?

1007
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,048
I got it!
I got it! Let go!

1008
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:47,364
Thanks a lot, bro. And close
a couple buttons... club policy.

1009
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,451
God bless!

1010
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,091
I got the orange one!

1011
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:52,645
I need some water.

1012
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,290
Stop it! Stop it!

1013
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,925
I will fucking kill you.

1014
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:57,241
Where is he?

1015
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,363
Get in there.
Okay, one more time.

1016
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:00,601
Get her away.

1017
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:02,281
Jesus,
there's too many of them!

1018
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,731
- Hello.
- Hi.

1019
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:06,884
Your moves are weird
as shit... and I love it.

1020
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,451
You have really soft hair.

1021
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,045
Oh, yeah,
it's the shampoo move!

1022
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:11,970
Use your boobs!

1023
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:14,084
You see these?
Oh, God, yeah.

1024
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,246
I'm looking, I'm liking.
Oh, girl, so great!

1025
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:21,650
Hey, what is this?

1026
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,729
What's going on? Whoa!

1027
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:28,281
Oh, God, back it in.
Whoa, please!

1028
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,161
Hi.
Hi.

1029
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,006
You're the first chick over
forty to give me a boner.

1030
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:35,441
Great.

1031
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:36,767
Want to go get a drink?

1032
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:38,569
Okay. Yeah.

1033
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,964
Maybe. Maybe.

1034
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,443
That's the only reason
girls hit on me.

1035
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:46,681
Oh, sorry, yeah.

1036
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,922
Every night, the hottest
chicks come in here.

1037
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:52,448
They're like, "There's LeSoire!"
Short skirts, too much makeup.

1038
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:54,125
Looking like fucking gremlins.

1039
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:55,440
Oh, I hate that!

1040
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:58,769
Don't feed them after midnight, right?
They turn into more sluts.

1041
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:01,885
Give me a whiskey.

1042
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:03,770
I just noticed that lion.

1043
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:05,450
That is amazing.
Fuck!

1044
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,126
Who the fuck keeps putting
lions in the back?

1045
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:09,921
Fourteen dollars.

1046
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:11,081
Fourteen dollars?

1047
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:14,082
Is it magic fucking whiskey?

1048
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:17,403
Do I get a motorcycle with it?
Is it served in Jesus's shoe?

1049
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:18,761
Can I sit in your lap?

1050
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:19,921
Obviously.

1051
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,281
I like where this is going.

1052
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:23,407
Me, too.

1053
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,561
I would love to!

1054
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:30,087
We're having
a big foam party later.

1055
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,090
So sorry.

1056
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:37,088
I am so sorry.

1057
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:39,402
Drunk bitch.
Get her out of here.

1058
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:41,403
She holds her
liquor like a five-year-old.

1059
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:42,720
I'm so sorry!

1060
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,442
- All right, sweetheart, you're out.
- Sorry.

1061
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:47,961
- I'm a pony!
- Sorry.

1062
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:49,884
Get her the fuck out!
Take her home.

1063
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:53,442
I've got to drive the school bus tomorrow!
It's my shift.

1064
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:55,608
- It's my shift!
- Here we go.

1065
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,250
I didn't get your number!

1066
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:59,402
I'll find you. I'll find you.

1067
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:13,485
Oh! Pretty nice, right?
Ooh!

1068
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,642
I have to say that
was pretty awesome.

1069
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:18,491
It really was. Put her there.
Put her there!

1070
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,643
No, put her there.

1071
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:23,005
Ah!
Don't do that.

1072
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,084
You just make it odd.

1073
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,123
I'm trying not to
lash out at you,

1074
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,009
and you make it
really impossible.

1075
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,282
What was that about?
We got company.

1076
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,685
Oh, shit.

1077
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,650
Hold on, I can lose them.

1078
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:38,847
You want me to take the wheel?

1079
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:40,285
No, I was a precision
driver at Quantico.

1080
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:42,647
They thought I was the instructor...
I was that good.

1081
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:46,721
Oh, shoot.

1082
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:50,407
Lose them!

1083
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,369
What do you think
I'm trying to do?

1084
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:57,403
Stop it! Stop it!
I got it.

1085
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:01,321
Hold on.

1086
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,326
Ah!

1087
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:16,887
And that is how
you lose a tail.

1088
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,567
Nicely done.
I'm surprised.

1089
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:22,570
Our friends are back.

1090
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,370
I got it. I got it.
Tag out.

1091
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:25,607
What are you doing?

1092
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:26,920
I'll show you
how I stop a tail.

1093
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:28,401
Watch out!

1094
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:34,681
FBI! Drop your weapon!
Oh, my God.

1095
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,769
- What the hell is that?
- I don't know.

1096
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,889
Special Agent Garrett, DEA!
Drop it!

1097
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,042
No, seriously,
what the fuck are you?

1098
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,567
What are you, fucking deaf?
I just told you, DEA!

1099
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,045
Drop your fucking gun!

1100
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:46,526
Now!

1101
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,244
Shit.

1102
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:51,369
I'm very sorry about earlier.

1103
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,570
I just thought you
were an assassin.

1104
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:55,564
Because of your... weapon.

1105
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:57,244
And because you
look evil as shit.

1106
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:00,722
Yeah, I get it. I'm an albino,
so I look like a bad guy, right?

1107
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:01,961
No, that's not what we were...

1108
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,087
Yeah. Yeah.

1109
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:06,050
Yeah, well, I'm DEA! And
let me tell you something.

1110
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:07,880
Two months we've been
sitting on that club,

1111
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,410
then you two
come in one night...

1112
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:12,211
...like a couple of amateurs and
almost blow the whole thing!

1113
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,607
Obviously you have no idea
who you are speaking with.

1114
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:15,960
I'm Federal Agent
Sarah Ashburn.

1115
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:18,805
Yes, I'm sure your credentials
are quite impressive,

1116
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:20,922
as is your choice
of... wardrobe.

1117
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:22,485
Nice hot pants.
You might want to try

1118
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:24,449
shaving above
the knee next time.

1119
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:27,285
Are you giving beauty tips?
Do you own a fucking mirror?

1120
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:31,081
Listen. This whole "female
professionals in the workplace" thing,

1121
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:32,241
I'm fine with it.

1122
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:35,450
But the problem, all due
respect with you people...

1123
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:38,126
...is that you get all excited,
your emotions take over...

1124
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:40,806
...your hormones kick in, you're
riding the cotton pony...

1125
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,371
Next thing you know
you're complimenting

1126
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:44,124
the bad guy on
his fucking couch!

1127
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:46,721
Oh, all due respect to you,
who's your wife?

1128
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,529
A five-pound bag of flour
with a hole in it?

1129
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:50,284
Hey, hey, hey!
Listen, ma'ams.

1130
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:53,086
We've been cramped inside
this van for two months.

1131
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,571
We're not gonna
let you swoop in

1132
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:55,926
from nowhere and
take all the credit.

1133
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:58,321
I don't want to see you two
anywhere near this case!

1134
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:00,489
We have got
informants everywhere!

1135
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,324
We've got
surveillance everywhere!

1136
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:03,686
We do not need
the two of you...

1137
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:06,320
...coming in with your estrogen
flying at full speed...

1138
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,927
...sticking out in the middle of broad
daylight fucking things up for us!

1139
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:12,651
Because the two of us are
gonna bring these guys in.

1140
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:15,330
Fuck you, chalk balls!

1141
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:17,403
Not even on your birthday,
sweetheart.

1142
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,165
That's right, keep walking.

1143
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:22,685
This isn't over.

1144
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:28,001
FYI, we women were born
with hair on our legs.

1145
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:34,521
You don't have to stop.

1146
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:35,840
What are you doing? Whoa!

1147
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,282
You want to tell me
what was wrong back there?

1148
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:44,361
Nothing.

1149
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:46,204
I saw your face when
you watched the footage.

1150
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:50,647
It looked like you saw someone you knew.
Possibly your brother?

1151
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:54,204
You did not read that
from my fucking face.

1152
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:57,171
You read my file, didn't you?
God, you're an asshole!

1153
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:59,129
Yes, I read it,
but it is my job

1154
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,440
to know everything
about a case,

1155
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:01,560
including who I work with.

1156
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:02,961
I don't like that.

1157
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,328
We should talk to him tomorrow.

1158
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:07,645
Where is he?

1159
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:09,564
Probably at my parents'.

1160
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:11,842
Well then... let's
go to your parents'.

1161
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,401
No, I can't go to my parents'.

1162
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:15,767
Why?

1163
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:17,649
I'm the one that
put him in jail.

1164
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,401
Okay, never mind.

1165
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:25,362
It's not like I liked doing it.

1166
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:28,245
He got mixed up with a lot
of really bad people.

1167
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:29,891
And then he started...

1168
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:33,564
He started using that shit. I
just had to get him out of there.

1169
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:37,084
You know, ironically, a lot
of people become addicted...

1170
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:39,846
...when they're in prison.
I think it's like...

1171
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:43,243
...80%-85% of the inmates
require treatments.

1172
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:45,447
I hate you.

1173
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:46,726
Yeah, I know.
I'm sorry.

1174
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:50,049
But I actually wasn't finished.
I was going to say...

1175
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,928
Why can't you just be quiet?

1176
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:40,161
What the F?

1177
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:42,443
These are cloth.
They're nice.

1178
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:44,284
I could have shot you!

1179
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:47,165
Oh, I'm sorry, do you not like
someone invading your privacy?

1180
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:51,803
Oh, come on. I glanced at your file.
You broke into my home!

1181
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:54,122
I care about who
I'm working with, too.

1182
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:56,362
And it's a little uncomfortable

1183
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:58,363
that you feel the need
to travel with trophies.

1184
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:00,045
It's not what you think.

1185
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:02,567
They moved me up here,
rented this apartment,

1186
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:03,880
and that is all my stuff.

1187
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:07,681
These four shitty, sad boxes... this is it?
This is your life?

1188
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:08,961
Yes.

1189
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,844
Oh, God. I don't think that
could be any sadder if you...

1190
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,490
...threw it all
in the trash bag

1191
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:16,210
and started
dragging it behind you.

1192
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:19,450
You use coffee filters for
toilet paper at your house.

1193
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,602
I'm buying them anyway.
They have a dual purpose.

1194
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,325
That's not what they're for.

1195
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:26,324
Yeah, real fancy-pants.
I see it. I see it in here.

1196
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:28,682
Looks like you were pretty
cool in high school, huh?

1197
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:31,286
Yes. Yes, I was.
But what...

1198
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:32,811
Because you weren't.

1199
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:35,242
You know what that girl's not?
That girl's not cool.

1200
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,721
My favorite part is you
only have two signatures...

1201
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:39,410
...both by teachers.

1202
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:43,366
Mrs. Burke said, "Have a good
summer." That's a personal touch.

1203
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:45,689
My real favorite is this one.

1204
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:48,284
"It'll get better."

1205
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:50,011
Yes, fine.

1206
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:52,204
Okay, now we're even.

1207
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,041
Okay.

1208
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:55,645
I see you have a cat.

1209
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:58,521
Yep.

1210
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:02,767
Is he around? Because I'd like
to, you know, pet him and stuff.

1211
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:06,642
He... ran away, uh,
when I was in New York.

1212
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,681
Oh, God, that
kind of tears me up.

1213
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:16,481
Yeah, it was,
um... it was a loss.

1214
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:19,447
That cat got one look
at your shitty life

1215
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:21,921
and said,
"No fucking thanks, man..."

1216
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,563
"...I am outta here!"

1217
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:28,005
I'm still kind of just grieving
a little bit about it.

1218
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:32,123
That fucking tabby is an
asshole, that's what he is.

1219
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:33,725
Fuck you!

1220
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:37,686
Yeah, "Fuck you!" That's what I
say to that cat. Goddamn it.

1221
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:45,486
Such a shitty,
shitty little life.

1222
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,564
You can't even keep a cat.

1223
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,444
That hurts a little bit.

1224
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:51,563
That's just the grief.
No, not the grief.

1225
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:54,246
It's just the pounding
a little bit.

1226
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:56,723
Oh. All right.
Don't be a dick about it.

1227
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:58,285
Thank you for that.

1228
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,881
All right, let's
hit the road, okay?

1229
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:02,730
I've got to change.

1230
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:04,729
What's the matter
with your pantsuit?

1231
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:07,004
It's pajamas.

1232
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:09,163
Well, excuse
the shit out of me,

1233
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:11,561
I didn't realize you
slept in a fucking tux.

1234
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:13,644
Go ahead, get your top hat.

1235
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:36,722
This is the place where
you're supposed to be civilized!

1236
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,527
Be a mother
for once in your life.

1237
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,923
Oh, great. This asshole!

1238
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:45,641
Just take it easy.
Hey, Pop.

1239
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,240
Hey, pork chop.

1240
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,402
Well, well, well.
Look who it is!

1241
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:52,604
The rat's back in the house. Did you
come back to arrest somebody else?

1242
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:55,963
You know, I saw Ma throw a can of Diet
Coke in the garbage the other day.

1243
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:57,645
She didn't recycle it!

1244
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:01,043
Dad here, he's splicing cable
off the neighbors next door.

1245
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:02,287
Come on now, Mark.

1246
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:03,880
Maybe you should
fingerprint him.

1247
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,922
Maybe get yourself
some stripes!

1248
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:07,650
Petey here, how many songs

1249
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:09,768
you download illegally
off the Internet? 5,000?

1250
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:11,724
- Ten, twenty thousand.
- 20,000!

1251
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:13,962
Mikey just stole
a laptop from his work!

1252
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:16,805
Stole? I fucking worked there for six weeks.
I deserved to take it.

1253
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:18,962
Exactly. No health insurance.
That balances out.

1254
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:21,561
But not you... you'll probably
call in the SWAT team!

1255
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:24,007
Actually, she could, because
those are horrible examples.

1256
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:26,162
Here are the nuggies!

1257
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:27,321
Here we go.

1258
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:33,645
What kind of an animal throws
her own brother in jail?

1259
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,082
This kind of animal... right here!
Shut up.

1260
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:37,841
How about keeps him
from killing himself?

1261
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:39,530
I was the only one that
got him off the street.

1262
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:40,801
None of you fucks did!

1263
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:43,361
You should never
arrest your family!

1264
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:45,443
Who the fuck are you?
That's Gina!

1265
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:47,443
Well, tell Gina I'm gonna
strangle her at the table!

1266
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:50,001
She is my best friend! You touch
her, you gotta go through me first.

1267
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:51,491
Who the fuck are you?

1268
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:53,761
I'll kill you, and kill her
with your fucking dead body!

1269
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:56,566
Everybody calm down.
Shannon's right.

1270
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:59,326
This one has no business
chiming in on a family matter!

1271
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:01,721
"This one?" Why are you talking
about my girlfriend like that?

1272
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:03,882
She wears sweatpants
to your mother's dinner!

1273
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:05,320
Those are her
classy sweatpants.

1274
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:06,961
They don't say
"Insert Here" on the ass.

1275
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:08,320
Her ass is hanging out!

1276
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,243
Look at her breasts
at the table!

1277
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:15,045
Welcome home.

1278
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:17,287
You here to arrest me?

1279
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:18,407
I hope not.

1280
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:20,766
You selling Bibles?

1281
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:22,410
No, she's Ashburn.

1282
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:23,921
Let's go.

1283
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:25,571
We need to talk.

1284
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:28,091
Sit down.

1285
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:44,080
Uh, that is one
of the better...

1286
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:47,082
...Jesus sports-themed
paintings I've seen.

1287
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:49,601
It's very good. Nice.

1288
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:51,451
What are you doing
at Club Ekko?

1289
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:54,251
What are you, my mother?
How do you know I was there?

1290
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:58,047
I know everything. Are you already
working for those guys again?

1291
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:00,521
No, this guy Julian,
he sent for me

1292
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:02,290
because he wants me
to start working with him.

1293
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:04,966
But I told him no, I'm getting
a straight job, and it's fine.

1294
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:08,488
Everybody's cool now.
We parted amicably.

1295
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:10,969
Are you a knock?
I'm sorry?

1296
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:13,202
Are you a knock?
A "knock"?

1297
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:14,886
I'm sorry, I don't
know what that is.

1298
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:16,291
A knock.

1299
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:18,090
Am I speaking fucking Japanese?

1300
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:19,281
Yeah, listen to him.

1301
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:20,891
I'll sound it out for you.

1302
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:22,810
Are you...

1303
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:25,162
...or are you not...

1304
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:28,163
...a knock?
A fucking knock!

1305
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:30,250
Like Johnny Depp
in <i>21 Jump Street.</i>

1306
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:32,607
Ah, I see! Okay, a narc.

1307
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:35,327
A knock, yes!
What was I saying?

1308
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:39,121
I was missing the R.I heard
"knock", but apparently there's a C.

1309
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:40,327
He said knock!

1310
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:41,811
I said fucking knock, right?

1311
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:44,327
Why are you wearing a long-sleeved flannel?
It's hot out.

1312
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:47,006
I'm a little fluey.
It's nothing.

1313
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:49,362
You want me to break that thumb?
Please, don't! No!

1314
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:50,846
Mercy. Mercy. Mercy.

1315
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:52,485
Straighten that arm.

1316
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:56,122
It looks worse than it is. It's not a big deal.
This guy Julian...

1317
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:57,970
...wants me to keep working.
They like me.

1318
00:59:58,120 --> 00:59:59,770
Tell me where I can
find Julian right now.

1319
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:00,966
No. Just stay out of it.

1320
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:04,203
They're maniacs. They'll chop you
up, or gun you down, or worse.

1321
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:06,323
Jason, tell me
what you fucking know!

1322
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:07,481
I don't know anything.

1323
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:12,522
Okay. Sal Natale.

1324
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,162
Okay?
You know Sal Natale?

1325
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:16,527
Of course I do.

1326
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:18,444
He was gonna steal
this huge shipment

1327
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:20,249
they got coming in,
so they popped him.

1328
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:23,051
He's in the trunk of his Caddy
under the Charles River Bridge.

1329
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:24,281
I want you to stay
in this house.

1330
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:26,886
If I catch you outside, I'll
hurt you worse than them.

1331
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,690
What are you?
Why are you here?

1332
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:31,002
I'm a federal agent.
I'm a Special Agent.

1333
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:32,531
Special, like retarded?

1334
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:35,407
We don't use that word.
We say "special needs".

1335
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:38,171
But I have a very high IQ.

1336
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:39,930
Are you a boy or a girl?

1337
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:41,571
That's a fair question.

1338
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:43,250
Uh, I'm... I'm female.

1339
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:44,681
No kidding.

1340
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:46,046
All woman!

1341
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:48,442
From the get-go?
No operation?

1342
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:49,766
Um...

1343
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:51,080
From birth, yes.

1344
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:53,360
How you get that close a shave
on your face?

1345
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,561
I need to go, but I'll be back to, um...

1346
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:57,563
Nice knowing you.
Yeah, thank you.

1347
01:00:57,960 --> 01:00:59,928
Yep, that's
Sal Natale, all right.

1348
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:03,567
Bullet hole through the head. That's
unusually civilized for them.

1349
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:05,564
Oh, they cut out his tongue, too.
Ah.

1350
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:08,406
There you have it. They
like to send a message.

1351
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:10,444
Did you find the tongue? Sure.

1352
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:12,244
Shoved it up his anal cavity.

1353
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:14,130
That's a weird message.

1354
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:16,360
The tip of the tongue was
sticking out of the rectum.

1355
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:18,130
So it made it appear
as if his buttocks

1356
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:19,804
were giving the police
the raspberry.

1357
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:22,765
Did they draw googly eyes or
anything on his butt cheeks?

1358
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:23,921
No.

1359
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:28,445
Seems like kind of an opportunity missed.
That would have been funny.

1360
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:32,924
Well, I feel that they were just
trying to be tongue in cheek.

1361
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:37,209
God, don't do that.

1362
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:40,202
Where are his belongings?

1363
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:44,282
Any clues as to where
the body was killed?

1364
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:46,442
We're still looking
for their base camp.

1365
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:48,489
Well, if there's
anything on him

1366
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:50,284
that will tell us,
I will find it.

1367
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:57,040
- Huh.
- Is that coke?

1368
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:59,641
I don't think so.
It's more like a coating.

1369
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:02,121
Same traces found
on all the victims' shoes.

1370
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:03,810
All of them had...
Epoxy powder coating.

1371
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:04,881
Right?

1372
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:06,041
That's right.

1373
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:09,804
Each sample was made of the same ingredient.
Which means...

1374
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:11,491
They were all
killed same place.

1375
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:12,641
Exactly.

1376
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:14,085
I checked it out Wow.

1377
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:16,163
There are three places that
have this kind of powder.

1378
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:18,322
Paint factory!
Yeah.

1379
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:20,404
We all know that.
Well, it's...

1380
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:22,085
Look at this.

1381
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:25,402
This one right here is
centered in the location...

1382
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:28,086
Where all four dead
bodies were found!

1383
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,323
Right.
That's what I thought.

1384
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:31,891
This one shut down years ago,

1385
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:33,291
owned by a man by
the name of Lief Sa...

1386
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:34,930
Sambertineson?
Sagglemint?

1387
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:37,446
Samber...?
Old Sagglemint.

1388
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:38,761
Santino.

1389
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:40,922
Oh, Santino!
Santino... Santino.

1390
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:43,444
Is that a derivative
of Sagglemint?

1391
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:45,762
Get me the address
to that paint factory ASAP.

1392
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:47,365
Excuse me, Ashburn? Um...

1393
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:49,091
I was wondering...

1394
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:50,850
Oh. This
is a little awkward.

1395
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:53,600
Uh, it's nothing personal, but
as a rule I make it a point...

1396
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:56,206
...not to date my
co-workers, so... thank you.

1397
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:59,204
I was wondering if you would
not talk to me in that tone.

1398
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:01,968
Oh! Yes, of course!

1399
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:03,884
That's a little different.

1400
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:05,451
I wouldn't.
Why would I?

1401
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:07,050
Why would you? Really.

1402
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:09,124
We should go to
the paint factory.

1403
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:12,284
Are we clear here? Because
it got real awkward.

1404
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:14,568
No... I think we're all good.
Right?

1405
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:16,370
Uh... ASHBURN: We're really good.

1406
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:17,487
Same page.

1407
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:18,880
Because I don't want any bad...

1408
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:20,126
We're all good.
Here we go.

1409
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:21,805
Let's go to the paint factory.

1410
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:24,406
She doesn't want to date
co-workers, so spread the word.

1411
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:25,641
Shut up.

1412
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:29,043
<i>Caught my man cheating Now I'm
rolling through the west side</i>

1413
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:31,771
<i>'Bout to burn this fucking
house down like I'm Left Eye</i>

1414
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:32,807
<i>Rest in peace</i>

1415
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:34,211
<i>Like I'm Left Eye Rest in peace</i>

1416
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:35,486
<i>Like I'm Left Eye</i>

1417
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:38,530
<i>'Bout to burn this motherfucker
down like I'm Left Eye</i>

1418
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:41,968
<i>Heard my man is cheating with
another bitch at my house</i>

1419
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:58,210
What is that shit?

1420
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:00,601
Stop it.

1421
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:02,081
Just cover me and go right.

1422
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:03,525
Well, then say that.

1423
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:05,728
You make me want to shoot you.

1424
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:10,682
I don't know what your
problem is, but we told you...

1425
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:12,683
stay out of the city.

1426
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:17,648
I don't know what it is. Are you deaf?
Do you not speak English?

1427
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:20,443
I got to do something
with you, man.

1428
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:23,282
Look, Julian...
I'm sorry.

1429
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:25,602
I'll sell for you guys.
Whatever you want me to do.

1430
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:27,681
I'm just trying to
make some extra money.

1431
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:29,643
You can't blame
me for that, right?

1432
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:31,962
Relax.
I totally get it.

1433
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:34,122
Thank you. I'm not
gonna shoot you.

1434
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:36,282
Okay. It's cool, man. Thanks.

1435
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:38,283
He is.
Wait! Hold on!

1436
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:40,326
Shit!

1437
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:43,211
If we grab Julian,
I can get into his head.

1438
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:44,486
We'll have Larkin by tonight.

1439
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:46,085
Two against two.
I like those odds.

1440
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:47,400
I'll call for backup.

1441
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:49,285
It's already here.

1442
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:51,765
Oh, hey!

1443
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:55,209
I was looking for you. Um, I
forgot to get your number.

1444
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:58,682
Cool. It's, uh,
1-800-GiveMeYourFuckingGuns.

1445
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:03,167
That's, uh...
too many numbers.

1446
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:07,122
I met these disasters at
the club the other night.

1447
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:09,124
Now they're both here.

1448
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:10,760
You think you
might have been bugged?

1449
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:12,651
Give me a break.

1450
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:16,765
What the fuck?

1451
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:22,769
Think you're hot shit?
Guess what.

1452
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:24,569
You guys look even
older in this lighting!

1453
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:26,251
Come on.
Fuck you.

1454
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:29,683
Fuck you! It's not fuck me.
It's fuck you.

1455
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:33,248
You know why? Because I'm
about to fuck you up.

1456
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:37,801
Pick it up.

1457
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:41,840
Do it. Give me a reason
to shoot you in the face.

1458
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:48,481
How long will this take?

1459
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:50,290
Maybe 12 hours, hopefully less.

1460
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:51,964
I have to find out
what drives him.

1461
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:53,884
We could just beat him
with a phonebook.

1462
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:55,804
No! For so many
reasons, no.

1463
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:57,325
You just need to be
patient, all right?

1464
01:05:57,400 --> 01:06:00,449
It is crucial that
you remain patient.

1465
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:03,200
It's also crucial that you stop
wearing this stupid barrette.

1466
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:05,044
Don't! Just leave it.

1467
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:07,168
Why? You have one on your head.

1468
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:09,208
Yeah, on top of my head,
like a normal person.

1469
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:11,402
What is the difference?
Just move on.

1470
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:14,285
If you enter that room, you could
break the bond we have created.

1471
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:16,920
Okay? Just please, please
trust me on this one.

1472
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:18,923
Do you understand
how important this is?

1473
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,365
Yeah, I do.

1474
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:23,245
And you will be patient?

1475
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:24,881
I will.

1476
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:27,365
Okay. All right.

1477
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:32,721
Hello.

1478
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:35,121
Coffee?

1479
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:38,124
I drink a little more coffee
than I probably should.

1480
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:40,681
Where's Larkin?

1481
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:42,489
You couldn't wait ten seconds?

1482
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:43,961
What's so funny?

1483
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:46,202
You... thinking you're
going to make me talk.

1484
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:48,448
You're talking
right now, dumb-ass!

1485
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:50,360
You look like one of
the Campbell's soup kids

1486
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:52,084
who grew up and
became an alcoholic.

1487
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:55,449
Oh, surprisingly catty.
You're a fucking genius.

1488
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:57,762
I asked you to stay outside!

1489
01:06:57,880 --> 01:06:59,006
I need to go tough on him.

1490
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:00,531
Are you not already doing that?

1491
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:02,005
No! I'm doing
good cop, bad cop.

1492
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:03,361
You know, I can hear you.

1493
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:04,521
Shut up!

1494
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,321
Just please,
don't do anything crazy.

1495
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:11,164
I won't do anything crazy.

1496
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:14,808
What am I gonna do that's crazy?
I'm a police officer. Huh?

1497
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,490
Am I gonna
shoot you in the dick?

1498
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:19,484
You said nothing crazy,
and that is a no-no!

1499
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:20,561
No-no!

1500
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:22,409
Turn around. I need you
to pass a polygraph.

1501
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:24,250
Put it away!
Turn around!

1502
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:26,846
Don't worry, she won't do it.
She won't do anything.

1503
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,243
So you want to gamble with your
scrotum and your testicles?

1504
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:31,606
Okay, gamble away!

1505
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:32,801
Just go to the corner!

1506
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:33,881
I'm in it!

1507
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:36,686
I'll tell you what we're gonna do...
play a little game.

1508
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:38,330
I'm gonna take
out these bullets.

1509
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:41,167
Except this one. Because
this is my favorite.

1510
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:42,480
I'm gonna keep that in there.

1511
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:44,409
And then you're gonna
tell me where Larkin is.

1512
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:46,603
And you're gonna
tell me when and where

1513
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:48,682
that shipment is coming in.
Okay?

1514
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:50,641
Right now.

1515
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:54,448
I'm gonna kill you
and everyone you know.

1516
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:57,529
That's not what I asked.

1517
01:07:57,680 --> 01:07:59,569
Straight arrow,
take the gun from her!

1518
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:00,721
Now you want me to
save your scrotum?

1519
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:02,640
When is the shipment coming in?
I don't know.

1520
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:03,681
Ah!

1521
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:06,201
All right! There's a
shipment on Wednesday!

1522
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:07,885
Where?
I don't know!

1523
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,411
I swear to God, I don't know!

1524
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:11,284
Tell her! Just tell
her where it is!

1525
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:12,970
Don't shoot me in the dick!

1526
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:15,242
I don't know! It's gonna be Wednesday!
That's four shots!

1527
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:17,169
Don't take any more shots!

1528
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:18,964
Just tell her
where it's coming in!

1529
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:20,690
I don't know! Don't
shoot me in the dick!

1530
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:22,569
Enough! Stop it!

1531
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:24,484
You brought
Julian and LeSoire in?

1532
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:26,483
You out of your minds?
Wasn't too smart.

1533
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:28,404
Oh. So you're not supposed
to arrest someone

1534
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:30,528
when they commit murder
and try and kill you?

1535
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,162
You wanted us to
keep them on the street?

1536
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:35,362
You shouldn't
even have been there!

1537
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:37,522
Larkin is the big catch,
not those two!

1538
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:39,364
Now we're never
gonna be able to...

1539
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:41,124
Craig! Calm down!
We can all hear you.

1540
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:42,691
Yeah, dogs can hear you.

1541
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:44,211
Of course dogs can hear me!

1542
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:47,205
Are you okay? Because
you look really pale.

1543
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:48,885
It's a genetic condition!

1544
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:50,121
Ashburn, come here.

1545
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:51,891
Fucking snow cone.

1546
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:55,647
Oh, I get it! That's a good
one because I'm really white!

1547
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:59,606
Can I have a moment
with my agent, please?

1548
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:01,841
I'm good.

1549
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:04,962
All right. I'm gonna
be right over there.

1550
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:07,165
Right there.

1551
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:08,641
Thank you.

1552
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:10,564
Why didn't you alert anyone

1553
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:12,520
once you found evidence
of Julian's whereabouts?

1554
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:14,244
It was an unconfirmed lead.

1555
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:16,402
I wasn't gonna waste anyone's
time until I knew it was real.

1556
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:19,007
Give it a rest. I want
you to stand down...

1557
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:21,925
...while I figure out how to
repair all this shit with the DEA.

1558
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:24,208
Sir, no, please.
I swear I've been doing

1559
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:25,566
everything you sent
me out here to do.

1560
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:27,046
We've been doing
such good work.

1561
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:29,088
I know you are.

1562
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:30,401
It's just...

1563
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:34,648
I don't know, it's... never
easy when you are involved.

1564
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:44,771
Fuck that guy.

1565
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:47,640
If you're not in trouble,
you're not doing your job.

1566
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:48,961
Yeah.

1567
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:51,929
We should go get a drink. Right?

1568
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:53,611
What's the point of being a cop

1569
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:55,091
if you can't get one drink
at the end of the night?

1570
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:56,680
That's what I'm talking about!

1571
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:58,131
I said I just want one.

1572
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:00,403
Oh, no, no, here...
it is one.

1573
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:02,847
Sometimes he just likes
to do this thing where...

1574
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:06,681
...he pours them in three
little glasses, but it's one.

1575
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:09,641
All right, here we go!

1576
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:11,651
Let's loosen that up.

1577
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:12,960
Okey-dokey.

1578
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:19,801
There you go.

1579
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,002
- There you go. Keep a pace.
- Okay.

1580
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:24,003
Don't spit that shit out.
It's not free.

1581
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:25,366
Let's go.

1582
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:27,011
Keep that in.

1583
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:28,727
Ooh.

1584
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:32,168
Hey, how you doing?
I haven't heard from you.

1585
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:33,811
Shit.

1586
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,323
No, you haven't.

1587
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:39,007
Well, did I do
something wrong, or...

1588
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:43,767
Okay, here we go.

1589
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:45,764
It's not you, it's me.

1590
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:48,762
Uh, I'm still
working on myself.

1591
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:51,844
So I can't be a part of two
until I'm a better one.

1592
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:53,411
You don't have to do that.

1593
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:54,766
Oh, wait.
My favorite's coming.

1594
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,081
Oh.

1595
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:58,527
You make me want to
be a better woman.

1596
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:00,251
I thought we had a good time.

1597
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:05,003
We did have a lot of fun.
And now we're gonna move on.

1598
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:06,850
Let it go.

1599
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:09,365
All right. Cool.

1600
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:11,523
No hard feelings, right?

1601
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:23,042
Okay, hit it.
Hit it.

1602
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:27,127
Bye.

1603
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:30,964
I didn't know how else to say it.
It's pretty clear.

1604
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:33,290
That's why you
don't feed strays.

1605
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:36,131
Can we get two more...

1606
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:37,966
...shots?

1607
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:39,361
Six.

1608
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:44,042
We should get a
few more of these, right?

1609
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:48,684
I don't know, Mullins.
It's hard.

1610
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:50,810
I know we're not
supposed to say this,

1611
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:53,326
but being a woman
in this field is hard.

1612
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:57,726
Men are just so intimidated
by me, which is like... why?

1613
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:02,166
And then you put your personality
on top of that and it is...

1614
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:03,965
...it is off-putting.

1615
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:07,522
You know, I was actually
married for six some years.

1616
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:09,450
Was he a hearing man?
Yes.

1617
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:13,043
He didn't understand how
much the job meant to me,

1618
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:14,804
so I thought it'd
be best to just...

1619
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:17,765
...be alone rather than
to compromise the work.

1620
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,331
I get that.

1621
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:24,086
It's kind of weird that it does
get lonely... a little bit.

1622
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:27,607
It's hard to
make female friends.

1623
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:29,842
I hung out, you know...

1624
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:33,527
...really just with my brothers
and stuff growing up and...

1625
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:36,525
...they just all turned out
to be terrible people.

1626
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:37,761
So that's kind of a bummer.

1627
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:40,042
Your family loves you.

1628
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:43,206
I mean,
in their own unique way,

1629
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:45,203
but they love you and
that's a wonderful...

1630
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:46,361
Very unique.

1631
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:47,931
That sounds like
it's coming from

1632
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,684
somebody that's an only child.

1633
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:52,804
No, I was actually raised
with a lot of children.

1634
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,162
Other children?
What, in a circus?

1635
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:57,283
No, just in...
in the houses.

1636
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:00,329
Oh, my God.

1637
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,684
You're a foster kid.

1638
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:04,801
Yes, I was.

1639
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:06,211
Oh, my God.

1640
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:08,442
No. Jesus, that clears up a lot.

1641
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:11,364
Foster kid. That makes sense.
That's a tough go of it.

1642
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:13,847
No, it was totally fine.

1643
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:17,720
There was a lot of benefits
to being a foster kid.

1644
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:19,529
Yeah?
Yeah.

1645
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:22,683
On Christmases, there was
this local drugstore

1646
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:28,244
that would sponsor us and give us
little baggies of toiletries and stuff.

1647
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:34,327
On Thanksgiving, we would hit these
different putt putt golf courses.

1648
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:37,411
You'd meet all kinds of...
Other sad kids?

1649
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:39,403
No...
Oh, Jesus.

1650
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:44,004
That's the saddest series
of images I've ever heard.

1651
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:48,369
I don't think it affected me in
the long run at all. At all.

1652
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:49,441
You're probably fine.

1653
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:53,809
I can see how maybe it was, like, a
little bit, but not anything that's...

1654
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:56,202
Maybe it has?
Oh, God.

1655
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:58,204
Oh, God, my life!

1656
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,843
Oh, God.

1657
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:04,761
All right. Let it
out, that's it.

1658
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:07,202
Good for you to start
working through it.

1659
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:09,362
I don't feel well.
I don't feel well.

1660
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:11,688
You're not
making me feel great.

1661
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:14,281
All right...
blow it out.

1662
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:16,330
Really let it go.

1663
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:18,449
You've got more than that.

1664
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:19,801
Oh!

1665
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:21,890
Good job!

1666
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:23,725
I don't feel well.

1667
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:26,360
Do you want some Jäger?
Two Jägers!

1668
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:29,565
Let's hear it!

1669
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:31,161
Whoo!

1670
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:33,971
This is for you!

1671
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:39,128
<i>The chills that you spill
Up my back keep me filled</i>

1672
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:41,168
<i>With satisfaction
when we're done</i>

1673
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:43,242
<i>Satisfaction of what's to come</i>

1674
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:45,526
Sex walk!

1675
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:48,651
Look at it!
Look at it!

1676
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:49,887
Look at it.

1677
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:51,246
Giving it to you!

1678
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:52,561
Higher.

1679
01:14:57,920 --> 01:14:58,960
My name...

1680
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:00,726
...is Detective Mullins.

1681
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:03,360
You'd better lay your ass down.

1682
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:05,523
I smell bacon.
I smell bacon.

1683
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:07,364
I smell bacon.

1684
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:11,681
Ooh! Ooh!
Ooh! Ooh!

1685
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:14,724
Biscuits are done!

1686
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:29,851
Let's do it again!

1687
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:33,089
No! Stop playing this song!

1688
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:36,687
Why? Because you played
it 26 fucking times.

1689
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:39,406
Hey! She's a foster kid. Yeah.

1690
01:15:39,480 --> 01:15:42,723
She had Q-tips and tampons
and shit for Christmas.

1691
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:46,202
She's had a horrible,
fucking miserable life.

1692
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:47,884
Look at her!
Yeah!

1693
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:50,691
All right.
Play the goddamn song.

1694
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:52,888
Don't you fucking swear at us.

1695
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,968
Yes, you celebrate your music.
Okay.

1696
01:15:57,920 --> 01:15:59,081
Everybody, get up!

1697
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:00,930
Come dance!
Come on!

1698
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:02,810
Get up, you fuck!

1699
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:05,841
Get on!

1700
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:08,766
Look, it's a frenzy.
We started a frenzy.

1701
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,809
You're covered in nuts.

1702
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:14,647
You've having a bad dream.
You're covered in nuts.

1703
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:25,801
Let's give them a little something...
Hold still.

1704
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:29,887
<i>Spin me around
till I fell asleep</i>

1705
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:35,561
<i>Then up the stairs
he would carry me</i>

1706
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:40,328
<i>Girl you're every woman
in the world to me</i>

1707
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:44,403
I love this place.

1708
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:47,970
Hey, to this...
to this place.

1709
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:53,321
Ah.

1710
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:54,921
Ah.

1711
01:16:57,480 --> 01:16:59,289
I don't feel it.

1712
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:00,361
Keep it up.

1713
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:04,082
<i>Girl you're every woman
in the world to me</i>

1714
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:08,402
<i>You're everything I need</i>

1715
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:13,524
Oh, crap.

1716
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:19,606
Oh!

1717
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:24,208
Hey, how long
have we been here?

1718
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:28,205
Oh, crap.

1719
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:30,485
Okay, focus.

1720
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:45,286
You know what? Here's this.
This counts as something.

1721
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:48,522
That's it.
I'm all in.

1722
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:53,851
Hey, how's it going?

1723
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,321
Jesus, you've got to get
a mint in that dumpster.

1724
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:59,683
Oh, God. Was I smoking
cigarettes last night?

1725
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:02,724
Yeah, you kept taking them out of
people's mouths and smoking them.

1726
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:03,847
God, that's so nasty!

1727
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:04,967
It was pretty gross.

1728
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:06,610
Why is my jacket in the pot?

1729
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:08,489
Don't worry.
I'll get it right back.

1730
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:10,483
Let's see what you got.

1731
01:18:13,320 --> 01:18:15,004
Oh, shit.
That's great.

1732
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:17,202
Good evening.
That's great.

1733
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:18,925
There you go.

1734
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:22,007
I didn't think you'd care
that much about your jacket.

1735
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:24,160
You didn't care at all when
you gave away your car.

1736
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:25,924
Who did I give it to? To Wayne!

1737
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:27,206
Who's Wayne?

1738
01:18:27,320 --> 01:18:28,641
Wayne! He just
walked out of here!

1739
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:30,245
You were sitting
in his lap all night.

1740
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:32,209
You had your
tongue down his throat.

1741
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:40,721
Oh, God! It feels like
we've been hibernating!

1742
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:42,211
Didn't bother you last night.

1743
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:43,606
Oh, Jesus, ten missed messages.

1744
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:45,728
Will you get him, please?

1745
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:47,928
Wayne, Ashburn wants
her underwear back!

1746
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:51,402
I do not! You cannot take that car!
It's government property.

1747
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:55,281
Oh, yeah? Well, I pay taxes,
so fuck the government!

1748
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:56,726
Let's not, okay?

1749
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:58,290
Get out of the car,
you asshole!

1750
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:01,201
Oh, God.

1751
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:10,087
Oh, my God!

1752
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:11,446
Oh, shit! Wayne!

1753
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:13,725
God, your first boyfriend.

1754
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:16,123
You two were electric.

1755
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:18,004
How did Julian escape?

1756
01:19:18,440 --> 01:19:20,841
Federal marshals transferring
him got ambushed.

1757
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,446
We're not sure whether Larkin's
men followed the marshals

1758
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:25,602
or got information
from the inside.

1759
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:27,000
Isn't it obvious?

1760
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:28,207
Fuck you!

1761
01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:29,691
I know when I smell
a fucking albino rat.

1762
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:31,410
If you want to point a finger,

1763
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:33,164
why don't you point it
at yourself?

1764
01:19:33,480 --> 01:19:35,448
If you two hadn't
brought Julian in,

1765
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:38,161
Larkin would have never
known we were on to him!

1766
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:39,367
And this whole case

1767
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:42,011
wouldn't be the giant mixed-up
bucket of shit that it is now.

1768
01:19:42,160 --> 01:19:44,162
So fuck you and
your albino prejudice!

1769
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:47,364
Now Larkin knows who you are,
and Julian's angry as shit.

1770
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:48,965
If I were you,
I would get out of town.

1771
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:50,445
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

1772
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:53,530
Ashburn, he's right.
This isn't a choice.

1773
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:55,330
No way!

1774
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:58,324
You're not my boss, Puss in Boots.
And even if you were...

1775
01:19:58,520 --> 01:19:59,931
...you still
couldn't stop me.

1776
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,765
I have more invested in this
case than any of you assholes.

1777
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:04,450
And now you fucked it up!

1778
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:08,725
That's another fucked-up area of my life.
Thanks for bringing it up.

1779
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:10,405
No, this was just
emailed to me.

1780
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:17,441
Okay, fine. I guess
I'm out of line, huh.

1781
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:20,046
I'll step back and see
what you assholes can do.

1782
01:20:20,360 --> 01:20:22,408
Go U.S.A. Let's go.

1783
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:24,682
We got to get my family out.
They're gonna kill them.

1784
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:27,042
I'll talk to Hale. The FBI
can arrange everything.

1785
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:29,202
Are you kidding?
We got a mole in there.

1786
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:31,044
I'm assuming it's the
albino, but we don't know.

1787
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:32,121
It could be Levy.

1788
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:33,805
It could be somebody
from my precinct.

1789
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:35,370
It could be your boss,
<i>Puss in Boots.</i>

1790
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:37,966
We are going in there by
ourselves and doing it now.

1791
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:39,804
Are you with me or not?

1792
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:45,051
Okay.

1793
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:46,841
This is bullshit!

1794
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:49,002
Why should we uproot our lives
because you're an asshole?

1795
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:51,766
Don't talk to her like that.
It's not her fault.

1796
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:53,331
You want to bring everyone?

1797
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:55,004
No, but it'd be
like <i>Schindler's List.</i>

1798
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:57,931
Dad! Come on, we cannot
fit that in the car!

1799
01:20:58,120 --> 01:20:59,929
I don't want them
to take my treasures.

1800
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:02,520
No, no, no!
I thought you were inside.

1801
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:03,681
Say bye-bye.

1802
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:05,762
Say bye-bye. No. I'll call
you when I get there.

1803
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:08,642
You are so rude.
I know. I'm so sorry.

1804
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:10,041
This is my house!
Just go outside.

1805
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:11,525
Where are you going? Outside!
I'll be right back

1806
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:12,965
I can see through your shirt.

1807
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:14,371
Oh, God, are you serious?
Oh, my God.

1808
01:21:14,440 --> 01:21:15,441
What are you doing
with the bat?

1809
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:17,921
Just let 'em try to come over here, Shan.
Just let 'em try.

1810
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,365
They're not gonna
throw soft balls at you.

1811
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:21,204
They're gonna shoot you, moron.
Get your bag.

1812
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:23,081
Would you get over yourself
for Christ's sake?

1813
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:24,929
Bring it on, motherfuckers.

1814
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:26,970
Not you, Mrs. Amendola.

1815
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:29,680
Hi. Can I drive?

1816
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:30,921
No, but if you could
make your way around...

1817
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:33,526
Get out and let me drive.
I'm a really good driver!

1818
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:35,445
Mullins! Your mom.

1819
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:38,763
Our lives are in danger. I
may have to change my name.

1820
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:43,125
So if you get a call from
someone named Carla, it's me!

1821
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:44,930
When did you become
such a princess?

1822
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,047
You make it impossible!

1823
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:47,690
All right, seatbelts, everyone!

1824
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:49,530
Come on, buddy...
come on.

1825
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:50,886
Right here, buddy!
Right here!

1826
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:52,041
What the fuck is this?

1827
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:53,770
That's my puppy. I got
him four months ago.

1828
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:55,285
I named him Kevin Garnett.

1829
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:56,441
You're an asshole!

1830
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:58,010
You gotta see
the cock on this thing.

1831
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:01,763
Move. We're not bringing this
fucking horse to a motel.

1832
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:03,729
We gotta get Gina.
For what?

1833
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:05,723
Because you put her
fucking life in danger!

1834
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:07,291
Nobody gives a shit about her.

1835
01:22:07,480 --> 01:22:08,891
If I'm going, Gina's going!

1836
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:10,041
I'm not going
unless we get Gina.

1837
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:11,121
Just get in.

1838
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:12,321
We're getting Gina.

1839
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:13,721
Move your feet,
I'll chop 'em off!

1840
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:15,883
We're going to Gina's!

1841
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:19,246
I hope a truck
hits us and we all die.

1842
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:24,402
What the fuck is
this girl doing?

1843
01:22:28,160 --> 01:22:30,845
Could she go any slower? Could
she physically go slower?

1844
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,206
Go get your girlfriend.

1845
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:33,520
She's fine, Ma!

1846
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,002
I forgot my curling
iron, Mrs. Mullins!

1847
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:38,003
Come on, Gina, get in the car!

1848
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:39,241
What the fuck?

1849
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:42,165
I got you the rollie so you could roll the bag!
So get over here!

1850
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:43,367
You kidding?

1851
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:44,566
You bought me
a bag for Christmas

1852
01:22:44,640 --> 01:22:46,080
so that I could
carry my own luggage?

1853
01:22:46,160 --> 01:22:47,844
Gina, come on...
let's go.

1854
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,760
I'm gonna get you
a dick-sucker for Christmas

1855
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:50,926
so I don't have to
do it no more.

1856
01:22:51,080 --> 01:22:53,082
Go get her!
Jesus! I'm going!

1857
01:22:53,320 --> 01:22:54,600
Gina! You really
didn't say that.

1858
01:22:54,640 --> 01:22:55,721
Oh, that's why you're here.

1859
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:56,801
Go get her.

1860
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:59,326
Come on, Pete, just break
up with this girl!

1861
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:00,720
Let's go, let's go!

1862
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:02,240
You're making a scene,
you assholes!

1863
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:04,721
You think you're man enough?
You fucking man enough?

1864
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:07,851
Knock it off!
Just knock it off!

1865
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:09,411
I got this!

1866
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:11,370
Hey! Assholes!

1867
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:14,006
Get in the car! Get in the car!
Get in the car!

1868
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:15,645
Did she just pull outa gun?

1869
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:18,685
You know what happens now?
You don't get this one!

1870
01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:22,531
So, Jason,
your family seems nice.

1871
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:24,842
Yeah, we have our good days.

1872
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:26,371
My make-up is
in that one.

1873
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:28,290
I'll rip your pants off!

1874
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:41,407
If we just knew where that
shipment was coming to,

1875
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:42,970
we would have
Larkin and Julian.

1876
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:45,322
They would both be there,
and we could get them.

1877
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:48,205
I'm just happy that Jason
is out of there for now.

1878
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:49,561
Yeah.

1879
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:51,607
Shame, though.

1880
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:54,251
Having your brother on the
inside would be a coup for us.

1881
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:55,521
That's what you want to say?

1882
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:56,766
Because you're
saying that out loud.

1883
01:23:56,920 --> 01:23:59,924
You would say exactly the same
thing if it wasn't your brother.

1884
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:01,411
We're done talking about this.

1885
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:03,244
So if it was just
some random drug dealer,

1886
01:24:03,320 --> 01:24:04,520
you wouldn't send him back in?

1887
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:06,284
If it was someone like Rojas...

1888
01:24:06,360 --> 01:24:08,089
We're not talking about Rojas.

1889
01:24:08,240 --> 01:24:10,447
We're talking about my
brother, you fuckwit.

1890
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:13,251
We all have a lot to lose
if we don't catch Larkin.

1891
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:14,440
What do you have to lose?

1892
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:15,481
I have a lot.

1893
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:17,130
Some bullshit promotion?

1894
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:19,283
You don't give
a shit about my family

1895
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:20,691
or if Jason gets out
there and gets killed.

1896
01:24:20,840 --> 01:24:22,524
I feel you're not being honest.

1897
01:24:22,680 --> 01:24:25,763
Because nobody forced your brother
to get involved with drugs.

1898
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:27,046
You're an asshole for that.

1899
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:28,849
Okay, that's not
helping, either.

1900
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:30,451
I'm trying to
create a dialogue.

1901
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:33,046
Note that I start my
statements with "I feel".

1902
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:35,123
Oh, I feel like
you're an asshole.

1903
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:36,441
You know what I feel?

1904
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:38,807
I feel that you have worn that
shirt every day this week.

1905
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:40,803
And I feel that you
turning it inside out

1906
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:42,040
does not make it a new shirt.

1907
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:43,531
Well, I feel like it does

1908
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:45,722
Oh, really? Well, I
feel I disagree.

1909
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:47,326
Must be nice.
What?

1910
01:24:47,480 --> 01:24:50,006
Must be really nice
for you to know everything.

1911
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:52,202
To be so much smarter
than everybody else.

1912
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:54,960
I don't profess to know everything,
but I do know quite a bit.

1913
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:57,080
What I know is accurate
and scientifically proven,

1914
01:24:57,120 --> 01:24:58,724
and I share that
information with you.

1915
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:00,006
If you have
a problem with that,

1916
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:01,724
tune me out like you always do.

1917
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:03,325
Help! He's choking!

1918
01:25:04,160 --> 01:25:05,810
Okay, I've got it.

1919
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:07,969
Somebody call an ambulance!

1920
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:11,045
Check his mouth!

1921
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:13,043
There's nothing there!
Okay, lay him down.

1922
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:15,362
Sir, relax.
Everything will be fine.

1923
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:17,284
Let me get his head back.

1924
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:20,284
He's choking. I need a
knife and a straw, please!

1925
01:25:20,440 --> 01:25:22,886
A knife and a straw!
Why a knife and a straw?

1926
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:25,042
I'm going to perform
an emergency tracheotomy.

1927
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:26,281
I'll need a glass of vodka.

1928
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:28,090
Vodka! It's a Denny's!

1929
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:29,605
For sterilization.
Hot water!

1930
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:30,761
Do you know what you're doing?

1931
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:31,841
Technically, no...

1932
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:33,649
...but I've been
doing some research

1933
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:35,802
and I feel fairly
confident I know how.

1934
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:37,366
He's still choking!

1935
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:39,041
Sir, what I'm going
to do is find your...

1936
01:25:39,080 --> 01:25:41,200
Please don't put that in there.
Shh. Stop touching me.

1937
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:44,603
I think the cricothyroid membrane is here.
I'll make a small incision...

1938
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:46,444
Let go of my hand.
Please don't do that.

1939
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:48,329
I'm going to make
a small incision.

1940
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:52,280
The reason I'm doing this...
is because you're choking.

1941
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:55,165
I'm gonna cut in... just a
little bigger...

1942
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:57,402
That goes in
deeper than I thought.

1943
01:25:57,560 --> 01:25:58,846
Now I'm going to
insert my fingers.

1944
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:00,331
Don't put your finger in there!

1945
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:03,727
There is the membrane.

1946
01:26:03,880 --> 01:26:06,645
It's a fucking horror show! Don't
put your fingers in there!

1947
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:10,243
Sir, what I'm going to do is
insert the straw in the hole...

1948
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:12,607
...and it will allow the
oxygen to get to your brain.

1949
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:15,929
In one moment, you will feel the
oxygen flow into your brain.

1950
01:26:16,120 --> 01:26:17,804
That's not oxygen.

1951
01:26:17,960 --> 01:26:19,450
That's not oxygen!

1952
01:26:19,720 --> 01:26:21,085
That's a lot of blood.

1953
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:24,123
Oh, my God,
there's so much blood!

1954
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:25,481
I don't know what I'm doing!

1955
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:26,800
Stop crying!
You did this!

1956
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:28,485
When's the ambulance coming?

1957
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:29,766
I got it! Move!

1958
01:26:29,880 --> 01:26:30,961
I'm so sorry

1959
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:34,527
So much blood!

1960
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:35,647
You asshole!

1961
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:37,406
You probably
could have just pulled

1962
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:38,811
the piece of pancake
out of his throat.

1963
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,206
He's alive, isn't he?

1964
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:42,567
I have a cut on my arm
from earlier.

1965
01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:44,051
Do you think I
should amputate it?

1966
01:26:44,280 --> 01:26:45,406
You know you're
not a real doctor?

1967
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:46,606
Neither are you.

1968
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,002
Bye-bye! You're a
reckless person.

1969
01:26:50,160 --> 01:26:51,446
Thank you.
Not you.

1970
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:56,565
Oh, my God.

1971
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:04,491
Ashburn.

1972
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:08,809
Why don't you
have your own phone?

1973
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:10,365
Who am I, the Queen of England?

1974
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:13,205
I don't know. Does the Queen of
England only wear sweatpants?

1975
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:14,646
Fuck you.
You F you.

1976
01:27:14,720 --> 01:27:15,721
This is Mullins.

1977
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:17,888
Shannon, I left. I couldn't
sit there anymore.

1978
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:19,889
What? Where are you?

1979
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:22,761
I talked to them and everything's fine.
Nothing's weird, we're good.

1980
01:27:22,920 --> 01:27:25,002
It doesn't work
that way, Jason.

1981
01:27:25,080 --> 01:27:26,241
They know you're my brother.

1982
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:28,004
But they also
know you arrested me

1983
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:29,889
and that made it seem
like I hated you.

1984
01:27:30,040 --> 01:27:32,725
No, it doesn't work that way.
Shut up for a minute!

1985
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:34,882
<i>Look, I know where the
shipment's going to.</i>

1986
01:27:35,040 --> 01:27:36,690
I don't give a shit
about the shipment!

1987
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:38,364
Just get your
ass back here now.

1988
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:41,131
I'm gonna stick around or
they'll know something's weird.

1989
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:42,805
Get off me!
It's my phone.

1990
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:44,121
<i>Trust me, I'm trying
to do the right thing.</i>

1991
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:45,406
Are you kidding me?

1992
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:47,562
<i>What?</i>
Jason! Jason!

1993
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:48,881
Let go of my vest!

1994
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:50,361
Shannon?

1995
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:52,204
It's Ashburn. What the
fuck is going on?

1996
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:54,010
What have you got?
Don't talk to her!

1997
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:57,204
The shipment's coming to the Boston
Harbor Shipyard at 11 o'clock.

1998
01:27:58,040 --> 01:27:59,929
<i>It's a big freight, tons of guys.</i>
I got it.

1999
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:02,924
<i>They'll be heavily armed. You
got to be careful, you hear me?</i>

2000
01:28:03,080 --> 01:28:06,084
The ship is called the S.S.
Tank or something like that.

2001
01:28:06,360 --> 01:28:08,203
I promise we'll be there.
<i>I got to go.</i>

2002
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:10,562
I'll break your fucking arm!

2003
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:14,411
Okay, take it easy!
Just take it easy!

2004
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:19,926
Shit!

2005
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:23,250
You just made my
brother a dead man!

2006
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:24,930
No, he's gonna be fine.

2007
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:26,884
Mullins, I swear he'll be fine.

2008
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:29,247
We're gonna have
the full power of...

2009
01:28:29,400 --> 01:28:32,085
...the Boston FBI down on that
terminal tonight, I promise you.

2010
01:28:32,360 --> 01:28:33,850
He'll be fine.

2011
01:28:34,120 --> 01:28:35,645
It really is a good thing.
You'll thank me.

2012
01:28:35,720 --> 01:28:36,846
Shut up!

2013
01:28:45,680 --> 01:28:47,409
- All right.
<i>- The ship's coming in.</i>

2014
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:48,760
<i>Time to lock and load.</i>

2015
01:28:48,840 --> 01:28:49,841
Okay, here we go.

2016
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:01,084
<i>Police! Put your hands up!</i>

2017
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:05,728
FBI! Get your fucking hands in the air now!
Let's see 'em!

2018
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:07,605
Boat's clean.

2019
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:11,925
It's not clean. We found
a joint in that girl's purse.

2020
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:14,931
Oh, now...
this is really a mess.

2021
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:17,966
Sir, we just have to
hit the streets again.

2022
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:20,128
And if the shipment came in...

2023
01:29:20,440 --> 01:29:22,249
Ashburn, enough.
It's over.

2024
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:23,600
I'm sending you
back to New York.

2025
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:25,205
Sir, no, please!

2026
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:26,725
I'm telling you, I'm so close.

2027
01:29:26,840 --> 01:29:28,524
This was just a little hiccup.

2028
01:29:28,680 --> 01:29:29,966
It wasn't a hiccup.

2029
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:33,045
<i>Lo siento.</i>
Don't.

2030
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:34,805
Don't even...
Oh, God.

2031
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:41,566
Um, sorry. Detective Mullins.
Have you seen her?

2032
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:44,565
Hospital. Some kind
of family emergency.

2033
01:29:46,280 --> 01:29:47,486
Oh, God.

2034
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:06,162
He's in an induced coma.

2035
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:09,405
They shot him and left
him out in the street.

2036
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:12,609
I'm so sorry, Mullins.

2037
01:30:13,560 --> 01:30:14,925
I'm sorry.

2038
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:17,330
He was trying to move on.

2039
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:20,331
He had a job interview.
I saw the resume.

2040
01:30:20,680 --> 01:30:22,682
It was a terrible resume.

2041
01:30:23,320 --> 01:30:25,084
He mentioned prison and...

2042
01:30:25,480 --> 01:30:28,165
...in Special Skills he said,
"Keeping it real", but...

2043
01:30:29,480 --> 01:30:30,970
...he was trying.

2044
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:33,364
How's your family holding up?

2045
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:35,488
They're not talking to me.

2046
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:37,005
Blame me now more than ever.

2047
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:38,441
It's not your fault.

2048
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:39,686
Yes, it is.

2049
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,207
Damn it, I should have
handled it by myself!

2050
01:30:44,360 --> 01:30:45,691
So that's it?

2051
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:50,161
I'm not your partner anymore?

2052
01:30:50,680 --> 01:30:54,287
No, you're not. You're another
fucking disappointment.

2053
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:58,968
I want you to know that I'm gonna
find the man responsible for this.

2054
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:02,041
Hey, Shannon.

2055
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:06,370
Uh, that was wicked rude.

2056
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:09,807
<i>You can live your life</i>

2057
01:31:09,880 --> 01:31:12,531
<i>In a crowded city</i>

2058
01:31:17,680 --> 01:31:22,891
<i>You can walk along
a crowded street</i>

2059
01:31:28,680 --> 01:31:34,483
<i>But the city
really ain't no bigger</i>

2060
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:38,568
Police!
Put your hands up!

2061
01:31:40,360 --> 01:31:41,361
Really?

2062
01:31:48,240 --> 01:31:53,371
<i>But it don't do too
much good to be talkin'</i>

2063
01:31:56,600 --> 01:31:59,331
<i>Brother, when there ain't no</i>

2064
01:31:59,400 --> 01:32:02,131
<i>Ain't nobody listening</i>

2065
01:32:05,560 --> 01:32:07,608
I'll give these back to you.

2066
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:10,046
Thank you so much
for your help.

2067
01:32:10,120 --> 01:32:11,326
Anytime.

2068
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:14,886
We're gonna miss
you around here.

2069
01:32:15,080 --> 01:32:16,650
Oh, I don't think so.

2070
01:32:17,120 --> 01:32:18,406
I might.

2071
01:32:23,240 --> 01:32:24,924
You did a good job out there.

2072
01:32:25,240 --> 01:32:28,642
Just keep your fingers out of guys' necks.
It's nasty.

2073
01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:30,121
Bye.

2074
01:32:37,640 --> 01:32:39,802
We sent out alerts
to airports, train stations.

2075
01:32:40,120 --> 01:32:42,646
DEA's gonna take
the lead on this one.

2076
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:44,848
Although this is
a joint task force,

2077
01:32:44,920 --> 01:32:46,922
we're also working
with the Boston P.D.

2078
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:48,730
Adam and I will be handpicking

2079
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:51,121
all the officers so we
don't wind up with this.

2080
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:55,001
Any questions?

2081
01:32:56,480 --> 01:32:57,845
That's not right.

2082
01:32:58,480 --> 01:32:59,481
No, it's not.

2083
01:32:59,640 --> 01:33:02,689
That officer you're making fun
of and all laughing at...

2084
01:33:02,840 --> 01:33:05,047
...has more integrity,
commitment,

2085
01:33:05,160 --> 01:33:07,481
courage and guts than
anybody in this room.

2086
01:33:07,720 --> 01:33:09,370
Yeah... but less
mental stability.

2087
01:33:11,720 --> 01:33:13,768
So just to be clear,

2088
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:15,524
what does mental
instability look like?

2089
01:33:15,680 --> 01:33:16,966
Keeping people safe?

2090
01:33:17,040 --> 01:33:18,565
Protecting the community?
Getting the job done?

2091
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:20,563
Is that what it looks like?
Then great.

2092
01:33:20,720 --> 01:33:23,564
If that's what it looks like,
sign me up for the crazy house!

2093
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:25,524
That officer right there...

2094
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:29,686
...is a better law enforcement
officer than anybody in this room.

2095
01:33:30,040 --> 01:33:33,362
Myself included. She is better than
you, she is better than you...

2096
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:35,522
...and she is definitely
better than you.

2097
01:33:35,680 --> 01:33:38,684
What are you doing? Are you texting?
Playing a game?

2098
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:41,770
What is it? Put it away!
God, you guys!

2099
01:33:42,040 --> 01:33:45,726
What is the matter with you?
You're just such jerks!

2100
01:33:46,360 --> 01:33:48,044
You're just such...

2101
01:33:48,240 --> 01:33:53,246
You're just a shit-jerk! You're
just a shit-jerk dick... fucker!

2102
01:33:53,560 --> 01:33:56,564
You're a shit-jerk
dick-fucker assholer!

2103
01:33:56,760 --> 01:33:59,445
And you just go
fuck yourselves!

2104
01:33:59,880 --> 01:34:02,281
Sorry, <i>señor,</i> not you.
Pardon, please.

2105
01:34:02,600 --> 01:34:04,921
Just... all you fuckers!

2106
01:34:15,080 --> 01:34:16,241
Get on the ground!

2107
01:34:16,440 --> 01:34:17,441
You are under arrest!

2108
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:20,723
Put your hands up and tell me where
the fuck Larkin is!

2109
01:34:21,320 --> 01:34:24,927
I think it'd be much more better
if you put your hands up.

2110
01:34:25,560 --> 01:34:27,403
"Much more better?"

2111
01:34:27,560 --> 01:34:29,927
Drop the gun and take a
grammar course, you idiot.

2112
01:34:30,120 --> 01:34:31,645
Who the fuck are you?

2113
01:34:31,960 --> 01:34:33,291
Me and her...

2114
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:36,604
...we're the fucking heat.

2115
01:34:39,080 --> 01:34:42,482
All right... we've got some
scumbags to visit, huh?

2116
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:44,768
Yeah, we do.
Get up, asshole!

2117
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:45,961
Let's go.

2118
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:50,567
Where's Larkin?

2119
01:34:50,640 --> 01:34:51,926
I don't even know who that is.

2120
01:34:52,120 --> 01:34:53,201
Where is he?

2121
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:54,601
I don't know who
the fuck that is!

2122
01:34:54,760 --> 01:34:56,444
Really? It's clean?

2123
01:34:56,960 --> 01:34:58,644
You not finding anything?

2124
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:00,450
Nothing in here?

2125
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:03,444
Okay, hold on a second.
How about this? Right there!

2126
01:35:03,640 --> 01:35:05,165
Right there!

2127
01:35:05,560 --> 01:35:07,688
Got your pizza!

2128
01:35:08,280 --> 01:35:09,850
Got your pizza, mister!

2129
01:35:11,200 --> 01:35:12,645
Fresh hot pizza!

2130
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:14,962
Get on your knees!
Where's your stash?

2131
01:35:15,120 --> 01:35:16,281
I don't have anything yet.

2132
01:35:16,360 --> 01:35:17,964
I'm waiting to get some
from a new distributor.

2133
01:35:18,120 --> 01:35:19,804
Who's your new distributor?

2134
01:35:24,120 --> 01:35:25,963
Oh, shit, man!

2135
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:27,651
Guess who.

2136
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,002
Surprise.
Come on, man!

2137
01:35:30,240 --> 01:35:32,891
I don't know what y'all are doing here!
I'm out of the game.

2138
01:35:33,080 --> 01:35:35,560
You know what I hate? Drugs.
I'm a different man!

2139
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:39,086
This is not mine.

2140
01:35:39,160 --> 01:35:40,650
I just bought that
refrigerator the other day.

2141
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:42,644
This must have been in there.

2142
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:46,049
We want to know
where all this new shit

2143
01:35:46,120 --> 01:35:47,770
is coming from.
Where is Larkin?

2144
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:51,925
Bitch, what part of "I'm out"
do you not understand? I'm out!

2145
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:55,331
You want to interview him?

2146
01:35:55,880 --> 01:35:59,327
No. No. I think I have
something better in mind.

2147
01:36:01,400 --> 01:36:04,051
Oh, shit! I don't know shit!
Come on!

2148
01:36:04,360 --> 01:36:06,840
I don't know, you're
getting awfully heavy, Rojas.

2149
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:08,047
Yeah, lie to me again.

2150
01:36:08,160 --> 01:36:10,480
I want to feel your body sliding
through my delicate hands.

2151
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:11,601
I don't know shit!

2152
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:13,410
Whoa, I can't hold you!

2153
01:36:13,480 --> 01:36:14,680
No, I don't want to die!

2154
01:36:14,720 --> 01:36:16,051
I don't want to die!

2155
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:18,965
Okay! It's at a warehouse!
On Summer Street!

2156
01:36:19,240 --> 01:36:21,242
I'm almost disappointed.
Get me up!

2157
01:36:21,400 --> 01:36:22,606
Let's pull him up.

2158
01:36:22,680 --> 01:36:25,081
No, I'm not kidding.
I can't lift him up.

2159
01:36:25,360 --> 01:36:26,600
I can't lift him!

2160
01:36:26,680 --> 01:36:28,125
I've only done this
one other time

2161
01:36:28,200 --> 01:36:29,565
and it was
a really tiny hooker.

2162
01:36:29,800 --> 01:36:31,040
Lift my ass up!

2163
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:32,770
You ain't putting
nobody over no rails

2164
01:36:32,840 --> 01:36:34,285
you can't fucking
lift them out!

2165
01:36:34,520 --> 01:36:35,885
Okay, okay!

2166
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:39,925
Uh... Just tuck your head
and relax your body.

2167
01:36:40,120 --> 01:36:41,485
Lady, what the fuck?

2168
01:36:42,080 --> 01:36:44,082
Crap! Crap!
Get me up!

2169
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:52,721
Thank you again!
Thank you!

2170
01:36:53,720 --> 01:36:55,882
That was on me.
I take that.

2171
01:36:56,240 --> 01:36:58,720
I hope this ain't my car.
This is my car?

2172
01:37:00,120 --> 01:37:03,090
On, shit! My 2003!

2173
01:37:04,720 --> 01:37:05,926
Let's load up.

2174
01:37:06,280 --> 01:37:07,964
<i>Hey, I can be the answer</i>

2175
01:37:08,360 --> 01:37:09,771
<i>I'm ready to dance
when the vamp up</i>

2176
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:11,729
<i>And when I hit that dip,
get your camera</i>

2177
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:13,404
No, no, no!
Yes, yes.

2178
01:37:13,560 --> 01:37:14,846
You said that thing ticks.

2179
01:37:14,920 --> 01:37:16,206
But not for days.

2180
01:37:16,280 --> 01:37:17,406
<i>The bitch who wants
to compete and</i>

2181
01:37:17,480 --> 01:37:19,289
<i>I could freak a 'fit,
that pump with the peep and</i>

2182
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:21,203
<i>You know what your bitch
become when her weave in</i>

2183
01:37:21,280 --> 01:37:23,362
<i>I just wanna sip that punch
with your peeps and</i>

2184
01:37:23,480 --> 01:37:25,084
<i>Sit in that lunch
if you're treating</i>

2185
01:37:25,160 --> 01:37:26,969
<i>Kick it with your bitch
who come from Parisian</i>

2186
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:29,566
<i>She know where I get mine
from, and the season</i>

2187
01:37:29,640 --> 01:37:31,961
You hungry? I got a
sandwich I didn't finish.

2188
01:37:32,280 --> 01:37:34,760
Is that the same sandwich
you offered me a week ago?

2189
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:37,487
It's cheese.
Cheese doesn't go bad.

2190
01:37:39,640 --> 01:37:43,770
<i>I heard you're riding with
the same tall, tall tale</i>

2191
01:37:44,240 --> 01:37:47,130
<i>Telling them you made some
Made some</i>

2192
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:50,966
<i>Saying you're grinding
but you ain't going nowhere</i>

2193
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:52,406
<i>Nowhere</i>

2194
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:54,847
<i>What you gon' do when I appear</i>

2195
01:37:54,920 --> 01:37:56,445
<i>W-when-when I premiere</i>

2196
01:37:56,520 --> 01:37:58,682
<i>Bitch, the end
of your lives are near</i>

2197
01:37:58,760 --> 01:38:00,285
<i>This shit been mine, mine</i>

2198
01:38:00,360 --> 01:38:01,964
<i>What you gon' do when I appear</i>

2199
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:04,085
<i>W-when-when I premiere</i>

2200
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:06,242
<i>Bitch, the end
of your lives are near</i>

2201
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:08,004
<i>This shit been mine, mine</i>

2202
01:38:08,280 --> 01:38:09,930
<i>This shit been mine, mine</i>

2203
01:38:11,360 --> 01:38:12,805
Baby formula.

2204
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:15,920
Cartels have been smuggling
cocaine in baby formula for years.

2205
01:38:16,160 --> 01:38:17,286
Two of them, two of us.

2206
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:18,486
I like those odds.

2207
01:38:20,840 --> 01:38:22,205
Boston P.D.!

2208
01:38:22,360 --> 01:38:23,691
Get down on the ground!

2209
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,651
That's right,
that's how we roll. Come on.

2210
01:38:31,680 --> 01:38:34,490
You guys are all coming back
from break at the same time?

2211
01:38:37,480 --> 01:38:38,686
Unfortunate.

2212
01:38:38,840 --> 01:38:41,161
You guys get less attractive
every time I see you.

2213
01:38:41,320 --> 01:38:43,243
Put the fucking guns down.
No, thanks.

2214
01:38:43,400 --> 01:38:45,243
Nice entrance, Teen Wolf.

2215
01:38:45,400 --> 01:38:47,448
You look like a Ninja Turtle.
Take it easy.

2216
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:48,647
I've held someone at gunpoint

2217
01:38:48,720 --> 01:38:50,006
for 72 hours before.
Let's go.

2218
01:38:50,160 --> 01:38:51,491
We need to do what he says.

2219
01:38:51,560 --> 01:38:52,607
What?

2220
01:38:52,760 --> 01:38:53,807
It's the best thing.

2221
01:38:53,880 --> 01:38:56,406
We gonna shoot our way out of this?
Put the gun in the bag.

2222
01:38:56,720 --> 01:38:58,404
No, hold your gun up.

2223
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:00,562
Give them the bag,
give them everything!

2224
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:03,565
Goddamn you. I thought
you had my back.

2225
01:39:03,720 --> 01:39:05,722
Put it in the bag
and slide it over, now.

2226
01:39:05,960 --> 01:39:07,291
It's in the bag!

2227
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:08,771
Slide the bag over!

2228
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:09,961
Sorry.

2229
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:12,848
I guess you and her
are engaged now, huh?

2230
01:39:12,920 --> 01:39:13,921
What?

2231
01:39:14,040 --> 01:39:15,405
Well, because...

2232
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:17,887
...you just gave me
a ring, motherfucker!

2233
01:39:17,960 --> 01:39:18,961
Oh, shit!

2234
01:39:26,960 --> 01:39:28,121
Shit.

2235
01:39:31,240 --> 01:39:32,446
Oh, God.

2236
01:39:32,600 --> 01:39:34,728
No, stop, stop!
Okay, that feels broken.

2237
01:39:34,880 --> 01:39:36,041
Pull it out.

2238
01:39:36,120 --> 01:39:37,326
It's out!

2239
01:39:37,640 --> 01:39:38,721
Nice work.

2240
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:40,962
How many of you are there?
Really!

2241
01:39:46,520 --> 01:39:47,851
How funny.

2242
01:39:49,160 --> 01:39:53,006
This is like when you were interrogating
me, only now you're tied up...

2243
01:39:53,320 --> 01:39:55,163
...and I've got
all these knives.

2244
01:39:57,320 --> 01:39:59,846
You know, I don't
like to shoot people.

2245
01:40:00,080 --> 01:40:01,923
I like cutting people up.

2246
01:40:02,440 --> 01:40:04,124
It's kind of what I do.

2247
01:40:05,920 --> 01:40:07,809
I like that one.

2248
01:40:07,960 --> 01:40:09,880
That's a good small one.
Good choice, it's small.

2249
01:40:10,200 --> 01:40:11,406
You like this?

2250
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:12,761
Not too flashy.

2251
01:40:13,120 --> 01:40:15,726
This is actually
an oyster shucking knife.

2252
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:20,287
Either of you ladies
need your oyster shucked?

2253
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:22,284
Not at the moment.
Not me.

2254
01:40:22,520 --> 01:40:24,887
I got to tell you,
I've done this

2255
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:27,361
a lot of times
to a lot of people...

2256
01:40:28,040 --> 01:40:31,044
...but you two, you're
gonna be the most fun.

2257
01:40:31,120 --> 01:40:32,360
What?

2258
01:40:33,040 --> 01:40:34,530
Larkin's here.

2259
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:36,690
Larkin.
Upstairs.

2260
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:44,206
This fun will have to wait.
The boss is here.

2261
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:47,724
Can you please excuse
me a second, ladies?

2262
01:40:48,200 --> 01:40:50,885
Sure, take what time you need.
Yeah, take your time.

2263
01:40:51,040 --> 01:40:52,565
Okay, cool.

2264
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:54,644
Oh, also, um...

2265
01:40:55,280 --> 01:40:57,123
...would you mind
holding this for me?

2266
01:40:57,360 --> 01:40:59,806
Well, my hands are tied,
but I can certainly try.

2267
01:40:59,960 --> 01:41:01,644
Okay, let me help you.

2268
01:41:01,880 --> 01:41:03,644
Jesus!
Thanks.

2269
01:41:07,240 --> 01:41:08,571
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
Shit!

2270
01:41:08,840 --> 01:41:10,683
Breathe through the pain...

2271
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:12,564
Yeah, do that.

2272
01:41:13,080 --> 01:41:14,411
Do that, do that.

2273
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:15,686
Breathe it out, breathe it out.

2274
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:16,841
Okay, Mullins.

2275
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:19,925
If we should perish...

2276
01:41:20,080 --> 01:41:22,048
We're not gonna.
Just shh!

2277
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:24,846
I know I'm not very
good with my feelings...

2278
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:26,809
...but I need to
tell you something.

2279
01:41:27,160 --> 01:41:29,128
You are smart.

2280
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:31,522
You are smart and
you are intuitive.

2281
01:41:31,800 --> 01:41:34,007
And you're the best cop
I've ever worked with.

2282
01:41:35,280 --> 01:41:36,645
You, too, thank you.

2283
01:41:36,840 --> 01:41:39,366
You were right. I went back and
looked at the evidence and...

2284
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:41,841
...I think the Red Falls
Killer is innocent.

2285
01:41:43,200 --> 01:41:45,043
Did you happen to
mention that to anybody

2286
01:41:45,200 --> 01:41:46,964
before you put yourself in a
life-threatening situation?

2287
01:41:47,160 --> 01:41:48,366
No, I didn't!

2288
01:41:48,720 --> 01:41:51,724
Jesus! Good luck... you're taking
that to your grave probably.

2289
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,321
Fuck, the other leg!
Fuck, the other leg!

2290
01:41:56,160 --> 01:41:57,889
You can move your chair,
too, you know.

2291
01:41:57,960 --> 01:42:00,008
I am moving my chair.

2292
01:42:00,520 --> 01:42:03,000
Just grab the knife.
Take it!

2293
01:42:03,160 --> 01:42:04,844
Just take it!

2294
01:42:05,880 --> 01:42:06,881
I'm sorry.

2295
01:42:07,040 --> 01:42:09,327
I got it! Shit!

2296
01:42:09,880 --> 01:42:11,882
Shut up.
Shut up. Shut up.

2297
01:42:12,240 --> 01:42:13,526
Just come on, all right?

2298
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:15,045
I am doing it as fast as I can.

2299
01:42:15,200 --> 01:42:16,611
It's almost there.

2300
01:42:18,040 --> 01:42:19,166
Got it!

2301
01:42:19,320 --> 01:42:20,446
Hurry up, hurry up.

2302
01:42:20,680 --> 01:42:21,841
Hurry up.

2303
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:24,005
What?
Somebody's coming up.

2304
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:25,890
Got to put it back in. What?

2305
01:42:26,080 --> 01:42:27,411
I got to put it back in.

2306
01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:28,965
And I'll put my hands
behind my back.

2307
01:42:29,040 --> 01:42:30,485
When he gets close,
I'll grab him.

2308
01:42:30,640 --> 01:42:32,404
But you got to shut up
and let me put it back in.

2309
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:33,800
Okay, just put it in.

2310
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:35,401
What are you doing?

2311
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:37,010
Sorry, it doesn't
go in that easy.

2312
01:42:37,160 --> 01:42:38,321
Just shut up!

2313
01:42:38,480 --> 01:42:40,084
Motherfucker!

2314
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:42,688
I'm sorry. Oh, shit.

2315
01:42:43,160 --> 01:42:45,640
I'll pretend to
keep my hands tied.

2316
01:42:46,080 --> 01:42:47,570
Shut up, shut up.

2317
01:42:49,200 --> 01:42:52,682
Oh, no, Scoob! Velma and
Daphne got captured!

2318
01:42:52,840 --> 01:42:55,241
I never thought I'd
be happy to see you guys.

2319
01:42:55,400 --> 01:42:57,004
We got to get her
to the hospital.

2320
01:42:57,200 --> 01:42:58,326
Did you guys call this in?

2321
01:42:58,440 --> 01:43:00,044
Yeah, I sent a fucking
owl with a note.

2322
01:43:00,240 --> 01:43:01,526
How did you even
know we were here?

2323
01:43:01,600 --> 01:43:02,761
We followed you.

2324
01:43:02,920 --> 01:43:04,365
I knew you wouldn't
give up easily,

2325
01:43:04,440 --> 01:43:06,283
especially not after they
greased your shitbag brother.

2326
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:09,882
Fuck you. It takes a lot more than
Larkin to take down a Mullins.

2327
01:43:10,120 --> 01:43:11,610
Jason's not dead?

2328
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:13,524
Come on, Adam.
Larkin is on his way.

2329
01:43:13,680 --> 01:43:15,682
What is this, a Q and A?
Can we do this later?

2330
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:18,207
Wait. Did he talk to the police?
Did he see Larkin?

2331
01:43:18,360 --> 01:43:20,886
How is she supposed to know? He's
been in a coma. Untie my leg.

2332
01:43:21,120 --> 01:43:23,805
That's too bad. Where is he?
Is he at Boston General?

2333
01:43:23,960 --> 01:43:24,961
Why? You gonna send
him fucking flowers?

2334
01:43:25,240 --> 01:43:26,321
Why are you so...?

2335
01:43:27,120 --> 01:43:28,406
Oh, my God.

2336
01:43:28,600 --> 01:43:29,806
You piece of shit.

2337
01:43:30,120 --> 01:43:32,122
You guys are
working with Larkin.

2338
01:43:32,360 --> 01:43:33,721
I really wish you
hadn't said that.

2339
01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:34,807
Said What?

2340
01:43:36,280 --> 01:43:38,123
Oh, God!
Shit!

2341
01:43:38,280 --> 01:43:39,805
That felt good!

2342
01:43:39,960 --> 01:43:42,645
It wasn't the albino.
I feel bad.

2343
01:43:42,840 --> 01:43:44,604
He wasn't working for Larkin.

2344
01:43:44,680 --> 01:43:46,170
He just wanted you off the case

2345
01:43:46,280 --> 01:43:47,691
'cause he's
a misogynistic asshole.

2346
01:43:47,920 --> 01:43:50,924
Why are you doing this? You
getting some kind of payoff?

2347
01:43:51,120 --> 01:43:52,610
I was in the beginning.

2348
01:43:52,840 --> 01:43:54,729
Six years dealing
with these lowlifes,

2349
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:56,450
making shit money...
Ah!

2350
01:43:58,000 --> 01:43:59,081
You're Larkin.

2351
01:43:59,400 --> 01:44:00,401
Holy shit.

2352
01:44:00,680 --> 01:44:01,727
Ta-da!

2353
01:44:01,800 --> 01:44:04,485
Get it? Right?
Makes perfect sense!

2354
01:44:04,960 --> 01:44:08,885
Now I'm bragging, but it's very
nice having a second income.

2355
01:44:09,200 --> 01:44:10,884
I heard shots.
What the...?

2356
01:44:11,280 --> 01:44:13,647
Aw, the albino.
That guy was hilarious!

2357
01:44:14,040 --> 01:44:16,202
Boss, I don't think that
was such a good idea.

2358
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:18,801
You spend three years in a van
with him, you'd kill him, too.

2359
01:44:19,080 --> 01:44:20,525
We'll pin it on LeSoire.

2360
01:44:21,280 --> 01:44:23,567
I've got to go to the
hospital to finish Jason.

2361
01:44:23,760 --> 01:44:26,604
You deal with these two. No loose ends.
Mmm-hmm.

2362
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:28,445
You fucking rat.

2363
01:44:28,640 --> 01:44:30,760
We told you to stay out of the way.

2364
01:44:32,160 --> 01:44:33,366
Good-bye.

2365
01:44:33,520 --> 01:44:34,851
You fucking rat!

2366
01:44:35,480 --> 01:44:37,084
See you, buddy.
Don't call me buddy.

2367
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:39,404
He's actually a great guy.

2368
01:44:40,040 --> 01:44:41,451
All right...

2369
01:44:42,040 --> 01:44:43,644
...let's have some fun.

2370
01:44:48,760 --> 01:44:51,206
I've been waiting to
do this a long time.

2371
01:44:52,440 --> 01:44:54,807
Campbell soup, you're up first.

2372
01:44:55,160 --> 01:44:56,685
Please don't hurt us.

2373
01:44:56,840 --> 01:44:59,241
Please. I didn't mean
to say the shit I said.

2374
01:44:59,480 --> 01:45:00,481
Don't hurt us.

2375
01:45:09,040 --> 01:45:10,565
Mullins, gun at two-thirty!

2376
01:45:13,320 --> 01:45:14,526
Get it!

2377
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:17,561
Don't!

2378
01:45:17,880 --> 01:45:21,089
You take one step
and your partner gets it.

2379
01:45:23,560 --> 01:45:24,686
Oh!

2380
01:45:25,160 --> 01:45:26,161
Oh, shit.

2381
01:45:26,360 --> 01:45:27,407
Nice.

2382
01:45:28,480 --> 01:45:29,527
Oh, God!

2383
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:30,647
Look at me.
Are you okay?

2384
01:45:30,840 --> 01:45:32,490
I think I'm gonna throw up.

2385
01:45:32,760 --> 01:45:35,161
That was
a really bad head-butt.

2386
01:45:35,400 --> 01:45:37,482
It was good... but
you're gonna feel it.

2387
01:45:37,680 --> 01:45:39,011
Go!
Get yourself untied.

2388
01:45:39,240 --> 01:45:41,322
Then we're gonna go
get Jason. Got it?

2389
01:45:43,880 --> 01:45:45,211
Why won't they
answer the fucking phone?

2390
01:45:45,400 --> 01:45:46,731
Go, go, go!

2391
01:45:54,360 --> 01:45:55,441
Oh, dick-fucker!

2392
01:45:57,880 --> 01:45:59,882
Get off the fucking phone!

2393
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:03,125
Useless!

2394
01:46:16,520 --> 01:46:18,045
We got something!

2395
01:46:19,120 --> 01:46:20,804
I got it.
Get her on the stretcher.

2396
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:23,804
No, I got it. I got it!

2397
01:46:24,280 --> 01:46:26,965
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

2398
01:46:27,120 --> 01:46:28,485
Wow, crap.

2399
01:46:28,640 --> 01:46:31,484
Here we go. Oh, crap.
All right. Got to turn.

2400
01:46:31,960 --> 01:46:32,961
Call 911!

2401
01:46:33,240 --> 01:46:34,651
You won't shoot me?

2402
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:36,211
Just call it!

2403
01:46:39,680 --> 01:46:41,523
Where is my brother,
you asshole?

2404
01:46:41,680 --> 01:46:43,921
It's that kind of language
from your family

2405
01:46:44,040 --> 01:46:45,804
that forced us to move
him to the east wing.

2406
01:46:46,200 --> 01:46:47,531
Move, dipshit!

2407
01:46:47,800 --> 01:46:49,211
Jason, I'm coming!

2408
01:46:49,640 --> 01:46:50,846
What the fuck?

2409
01:46:53,800 --> 01:46:55,131
Come on, come on.

2410
01:46:57,160 --> 01:46:59,003
This stupid chair!

2411
01:46:59,520 --> 01:47:01,443
Screw it.

2412
01:47:27,240 --> 01:47:29,686
It's amazing what a little air

2413
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:32,240
in the bloodstream
does to the human heart.

2414
01:47:32,840 --> 01:47:34,569
You may not want to watch this.

2415
01:47:34,840 --> 01:47:36,001
Wait!

2416
01:47:36,240 --> 01:47:39,050
I just want you to know
that I get it.

2417
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:41,684
I get it. I mean...

2418
01:47:42,600 --> 01:47:45,251
...I've been on the job
a long time and...

2419
01:47:45,600 --> 01:47:49,605
...you just see so many bad
things and bad people and...

2420
01:47:50,240 --> 01:47:54,768
...you just start to wonder if
there's anybody good anymore and...

2421
01:47:55,600 --> 01:47:58,922
...I just want you to know that
you don't have to do this.

2422
01:47:59,840 --> 01:48:01,444
You don't have to do it.

2423
01:48:03,440 --> 01:48:04,771
I know.

2424
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:07,125
But I do.

2425
01:48:07,280 --> 01:48:09,328
Because I have plans
that don't involve

2426
01:48:09,400 --> 01:48:11,448
me going to prison
with people I put there.

2427
01:48:11,680 --> 01:48:13,762
So say good-bye
to your mick brother.

2428
01:48:13,880 --> 01:48:14,881
Wait!

2429
01:48:15,680 --> 01:48:17,444
Drop it or I'll
fire this weapon!

2430
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:18,761
Or I inject...

2431
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:23,644
Oh, you shot him in the dick!

2432
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:25,171
Twice.

2433
01:48:25,480 --> 01:48:26,527
Oh, shit!

2434
01:48:26,840 --> 01:48:29,002
I took a page right out
of your book, partner.

2435
01:48:29,320 --> 01:48:31,527
But I've never done it.

2436
01:48:31,840 --> 01:48:35,322
I just aim it at it. I don't actually do it.
That's too fucking crazy.

2437
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:36,851
What about Julian?

2438
01:48:36,920 --> 01:48:38,160
I take the bullets out!

2439
01:48:38,480 --> 01:48:42,326
I just use it as a tactic to scare him.
I mean, Jesus, I'm not crazy!

2440
01:48:42,640 --> 01:48:44,642
Don't make me
feel bad about it!

2441
01:48:44,960 --> 01:48:46,325
No, I know.

2442
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:49,007
Ooh, watch that leg.

2443
01:48:50,160 --> 01:48:51,650
You did good, little buddy.

2444
01:48:52,480 --> 01:48:54,403
You saved my brother's life.

2445
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:02,882
Internal Affairs is going to open
a top-to-bottom investigation

2446
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,162
of every department now.

2447
01:49:05,440 --> 01:49:06,441
Nice work.

2448
01:49:06,680 --> 01:49:09,160
Well, it was
a team effort, sir.

2449
01:49:09,680 --> 01:49:12,490
Yeah, we put out
an APB on Julian.

2450
01:49:12,720 --> 01:49:14,882
Oh, don't bother,
he's in the trunk.

2451
01:49:15,840 --> 01:49:17,683
Oh, and, sir...

2452
01:49:18,840 --> 01:49:21,684
...we're going to have to reopen
the Red Falls Killer case.

2453
01:49:22,840 --> 01:49:24,205
Good for you.

2454
01:49:26,200 --> 01:49:29,204
I thought that would feel
good, but it felt awful.

2455
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:32,922
That's probably
gonna just keep feeling bad.

2456
01:49:33,720 --> 01:49:35,085
But I'm glad you did it.

2457
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:36,850
Should we be
leaving the hospital?

2458
01:49:36,920 --> 01:49:38,365
Oh, shit. No.

2459
01:49:38,680 --> 01:49:41,524
Probably not.
Probably not. Spin it.

2460
01:49:43,240 --> 01:49:44,924
Let's take this one.

2461
01:49:45,160 --> 01:49:46,889
Get up here.
Is that clean?

2462
01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:48,326
It's clean enough.

2463
01:49:48,760 --> 01:49:51,604
Oh, my God! It smells like
several people died on here.

2464
01:49:51,920 --> 01:49:54,241
Let me just sit. I don't
need to be on my face!

2465
01:49:54,440 --> 01:49:55,885
You can help the process.

2466
01:49:56,200 --> 01:49:57,725
Not clean!
Inchworm it up.

2467
01:49:59,400 --> 01:50:01,050
Okay, that's good.
Just flip me.

2468
01:50:01,280 --> 01:50:03,282
Get off the leg,
get off the leg.

2469
01:50:04,600 --> 01:50:06,090
Don't fall off!

2470
01:50:06,400 --> 01:50:08,129
I want this place
locked down, people!

2471
01:50:08,240 --> 01:50:10,402
Nobody goes in or out
without talking to me!

2472
01:50:10,680 --> 01:50:13,684
I want you three stationed at each
end of the east wing. Let's go!

2473
01:50:13,960 --> 01:50:15,724
Let's clear
this hallway, people!

2474
01:50:16,720 --> 01:50:18,085
Get the press out of here.

2475
01:50:20,600 --> 01:50:21,601
You Okay?

2476
01:50:22,040 --> 01:50:24,042
Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

2477
01:50:24,440 --> 01:50:26,124
Yeah, I knew you would be.

2478
01:50:26,640 --> 01:50:27,971
I'm good, too.

2479
01:50:29,400 --> 01:50:30,401
Excuse me.

2480
01:50:30,600 --> 01:50:33,809
This woman is one of the
best agents in the FBI.

2481
01:50:34,120 --> 01:50:36,805
Make sure she's well taken care of.
All right?

2482
01:50:39,960 --> 01:50:41,121
That was...

2483
01:50:41,560 --> 01:50:43,403
That was interesting, right?

2484
01:50:43,760 --> 01:50:45,603
I would look into that.

2485
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:47,331
What is that?

2486
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:49,890
All right, let's go.

2487
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:51,604
You actually have to stay here.

2488
01:50:51,920 --> 01:50:55,163
Well, just do what you
can to save that leg.

2489
01:50:55,600 --> 01:50:57,284
Oh, I'm not a doctor.

2490
01:50:57,600 --> 01:50:59,762
All right, fucktard,
I know you're not a doctor.

2491
01:50:59,960 --> 01:51:02,406
But tell it to the doctor!
How about that?

2492
01:51:05,960 --> 01:51:09,009
All right! I'll wait
right here for you!

2493
01:51:09,400 --> 01:51:11,084
Throw out that sandwich!

2494
01:51:11,240 --> 01:51:12,480
I'll bring you that sandwich!

2495
01:51:12,600 --> 01:51:13,806
No! Throw it out!

2496
01:51:13,960 --> 01:51:15,564
You got it, buddy.

2497
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:18,120
For outstanding service...

2498
01:51:18,160 --> 01:51:20,003
...Officer Shannon Mullins.

2499
01:51:35,840 --> 01:51:40,368
There you go, Shannon! That's
what I'm talking about!

2500
01:51:45,160 --> 01:51:47,367
Now hold it up!
Hold it up! Yeah!

2501
01:51:59,320 --> 01:52:00,685
Take out the gun!

2502
01:52:04,520 --> 01:52:06,170
<i>Just a little snooze, man.</i>

2503
01:52:06,480 --> 01:52:08,847
I move to
cake-toast to Jason!

2504
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:10,684
Yeah! To Jason!

2505
01:52:10,920 --> 01:52:12,524
May I have your attention?

2506
01:52:12,680 --> 01:52:14,760
I wanted you to have this.
It was your grandmother's.

2507
01:52:15,160 --> 01:52:16,844
She would have been
very proud of you

2508
01:52:16,920 --> 01:52:18,649
for taking care
of your brother.

2509
01:52:20,520 --> 01:52:22,363
That's awesome.
Take a picture.

2510
01:52:22,680 --> 01:52:25,286
Take a picture!
Come on, take a picture!

2511
01:52:25,360 --> 01:52:26,486
Are you serious?

2512
01:52:27,200 --> 01:52:28,531
"Dunkin' Jesus"?

2513
01:52:31,720 --> 01:52:33,210
No cell phones.

2514
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:35,331
How about now?

2515
01:52:35,560 --> 01:52:38,006
Oh, different story?
Aw, come on back!

2516
01:52:44,560 --> 01:52:46,050
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

2517
01:52:46,560 --> 01:52:49,803
So, you getting all
settled in your new digs?

2518
01:52:50,040 --> 01:52:54,045
<i>Yeah, they're pretty sweet. Who
needed that promotion anyway?</i>

2519
01:52:54,360 --> 01:52:56,886
I'm glad I stayed around
where all the action is.

2520
01:52:57,080 --> 01:53:00,209
We got a lot of scumbags
to take down here in Boston.

2521
01:53:00,400 --> 01:53:01,640
Yeah, we do.

2522
01:53:01,920 --> 01:53:04,082
<i>Hey... did you get
that package I sent?</i>

2523
01:53:04,400 --> 01:53:06,448
Oh, I haven't opened it yet.
I'm sorry.

2524
01:53:06,520 --> 01:53:08,568
Your dad sent me
something, too.

2525
01:53:08,920 --> 01:53:11,241
So it's like
the Mullins gift day.

2526
01:53:12,400 --> 01:53:13,481
Oh. Okay.

2527
01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:15,603
I signed it in the front.

2528
01:53:15,840 --> 01:53:17,922
Does that mean you broke
into my house again?

2529
01:53:18,160 --> 01:53:19,525
Maybe, maybe not.

2530
01:53:19,680 --> 01:53:21,603
Amazing how that door
opens all by itself.

2531
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:23,684
I see it. Very funny.

2532
01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:26,843
I know. I was just kidding.
Look at the back.

2533
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:29,042
<i>Oh, you wrote something
else mean and...</i>

2534
01:53:29,560 --> 01:53:31,289
...profanity-laden
in the back?

2535
01:53:31,600 --> 01:53:32,931
Okay, here it is.

2536
01:53:38,760 --> 01:53:41,604
Well... don't make it weird.

2537
01:53:45,360 --> 01:53:46,521
Later, nerd.

2538
01:53:46,920 --> 01:53:48,604
It takes a nerd to know a nerd.

2539
01:53:49,080 --> 01:53:51,765
Okay. You made it weird. Bye.

2540
01:53:54,800 --> 01:53:56,450
I left my baby in the car.

2541
01:54:18,960 --> 01:54:20,644
Hey, there's, uh...

2542
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:23,531
...something I've been
thinking about a lot

2543
01:54:23,600 --> 01:54:25,250
that's been bothering me and...

2544
01:54:25,560 --> 01:54:26,925
I got you something.
Oh.

2545
01:54:31,640 --> 01:54:33,005
I found your friend.

2546
01:54:34,160 --> 01:54:36,162
Pumpkin!
Awesome, right?

2547
01:54:36,480 --> 01:54:37,845
I drove all the way
to New Jersey,

2548
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:40,287
and I was up and down these
streets, looking all over.

2549
01:54:40,600 --> 01:54:42,170
I was just about to give up,

2550
01:54:42,280 --> 01:54:43,850
and I was over
by your old place,

2551
01:54:43,920 --> 01:54:45,445
and suddenly I hear
this little bell.

2552
01:54:45,600 --> 01:54:48,365
I thought, wait a minute! I looked
in your neighbor's window...

2553
01:54:48,600 --> 01:54:50,682
...and I saw this asshole
sitting right on the couch.

2554
01:54:50,840 --> 01:54:52,410
I said,
"You are coming with me,"

2555
01:54:52,480 --> 01:54:54,005
"even if you don't want
to go back with her."

2556
01:54:54,160 --> 01:54:55,525
Oh, he fought you, huh?

2557
01:54:55,680 --> 01:54:57,444
Yeah, he fought me pretty hard.
Wow.

2558
01:54:57,600 --> 01:55:01,366
But I'm just glad that I
could make this reuniting.

2559
01:55:01,680 --> 01:55:04,047
What a surprise this is, huh?

2560
01:55:04,840 --> 01:55:06,842
What a surprise, huh?

2561
01:55:07,200 --> 01:55:08,964
Look at where you are!

2562
01:55:09,680 --> 01:55:11,603
This was never your cat, was it?
No.

2563
01:55:11,800 --> 01:55:14,201
Goddamn it. Put him in the box.
Put him in the box!

2564
01:55:15,800 --> 01:55:16,847
Can you put him back?

2565
01:55:17,080 --> 01:55:18,525
Do I have a lot of choice?

2566
01:55:18,720 --> 01:55:20,370
Can you make sure he's got

2567
01:55:20,440 --> 01:55:22,124
lots of water?
Just don't.

2568
01:55:22,280 --> 01:55:23,281
He likes to snuggle.

2569
01:55:23,360 --> 01:55:25,120
Don't make me put the
cat down and punch you.

2570
01:55:31,080 --> 01:55:34,129
<i>It's no use
We're gonna have to fight</i>

2571
01:55:34,200 --> 01:55:37,329
<i>You've thrown your words
'round a thousand times</i>

2572
01:55:37,400 --> 01:55:39,801
<i>Like a child
who can't empathize</i>

2573
01:55:39,880 --> 01:55:43,009
<i>You don't speak the language
You don't read my signs</i>

2574
01:55:43,520 --> 01:55:46,205
<i>You wanna know
what I really think?</i>

2575
01:55:46,360 --> 01:55:48,931
<i>You wanna know
what I really believe?</i>

2576
01:55:49,560 --> 01:55:52,006
<i>There's a fire
burning up in here</i>

2577
01:55:52,680 --> 01:55:55,047
<i>See the smoke
coming out of my ears</i>

2578
01:55:55,120 --> 01:55:58,044
<i>Oh, no, we both know</i>

2579
01:55:58,400 --> 01:56:00,926
<i>More trouble's gonna find us
if we're all alone</i>

2580
01:56:01,760 --> 01:56:04,047
<i>I wanna show you
what I really mean</i>

2581
01:56:04,160 --> 01:56:07,164
<i>But you're always
on the outside looking in</i>

2582
01:56:07,560 --> 01:56:10,564
<i>Oh, won't you
come into my head?</i>

2583
01:56:10,640 --> 01:56:13,484
<i>Come inside,
lie down in my head?</i>

2584
01:56:13,760 --> 01:56:16,684
<i>Oh, won't you
come into my head?</i>

2585
01:56:16,760 --> 01:56:19,730
<i>I just wanna have you
up in my head</i>

2586
01:56:32,280 --> 01:56:34,601
<i>Look through my eyes
I'm your binocular</i>

2587
01:56:35,440 --> 01:56:37,681
<i>And every time you'll get
a shock you'll learn</i>

2588
01:56:38,560 --> 01:56:41,006
<i>What's it like to be
in my dimension</i>

2589
01:56:41,080 --> 01:56:44,050
<i>I'll be the center
of your attention</i>

2590
01:56:44,640 --> 01:56:46,881
<i>Listen to all the sounds I hear</i>

2591
01:56:47,560 --> 01:56:50,166
<i>The quiet prose and
the crack of the snare</i>

2592
01:56:50,920 --> 01:56:53,287
<i>Make your mark on my territory</i>

2593
01:56:53,400 --> 01:56:56,131
<i>Carve your name in every cavity</i>

2594
01:56:56,480 --> 01:56:59,290
<i>Oh, no, we both know</i>

2595
01:56:59,360 --> 01:57:02,091
<i>More trouble's gonna find us

<i>Oh, you want
a piece of my mind?</i>

2619
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,651
<i>Emphatic and erratic
at the drop of a dime</i>

2620

<i>Oh, you want

2626
01:59:01,640 --> 01:59:04,325
<i>This is my DNA and my chemistry</i>

2627
