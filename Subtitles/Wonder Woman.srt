00:00:48,842 --> 00:00:51,428
<i>I used to want to save the world.</i>

3
00:00:53,012 --> 00:00:55,223
<i>This beautiful place.</i>

4
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,102
<i>But I knew so little then.</i>

5
00:01:01,354 --> 00:01:03,773
<i>It is a land of magic and wonder.</i>

6
00:01:04,691 --> 00:01:07,318
<i>Worth cherishing in every way.</i>

7
00:01:09,612 --> 00:01:11,448
<i>But the closer you get,</i>

8
00:01:12,699 --> 00:01:16,286
<i>the more you see the great darkness
simmering within.</i>

9
00:01:20,707 --> 00:01:23,251
<i>And mankind?</i>

10
00:01:24,294 --> 00:01:26,921
<i>Mankind is another story altogether.</i>

11
00:01:29,257 --> 00:01:34,179
<i>What one does when faced with the truth
is more difficult than you think.</i>

12
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:46,191
<i>I learned this the hard way.</i>

13
00:01:47,484 --> 00:01:49,319
<i>A long, long time ago.</i>

14
00:01:52,197 --> 00:01:53,198
<i>And now,</i>

15
00:01:56,034 --> 00:01:57,702
<i>I will never be the same.</i>

16
00:02:05,376 --> 00:02:06,377
<i>Merci.</i>

17
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:54,592
Hello, Diana.

18
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:56,511
- Hello, Diana.
- Hello.

19
00:02:57,178 --> 00:02:58,471
<i>Diana!</i>

20
00:02:59,514 --> 00:03:00,974
Diana!

21
00:03:01,558 --> 00:03:02,559
<i>Come back!</i>

22
00:03:42,307 --> 00:03:43,808
- It looks very good.
- Very good.

23
00:03:43,975 --> 00:03:44,976
How is she doing?

24
00:03:45,143 --> 00:03:46,144
She's good.

25
00:03:46,311 --> 00:03:47,645
- Keep working with her.
- I will.

26
00:03:48,855 --> 00:03:49,856
Naomi.

27
00:04:12,337 --> 00:04:13,379
Diana!

28
00:04:15,006 --> 00:04:16,341
Diana, I see you.

29
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,724
Where are you going?
Slow down!

30
00:04:34,859 --> 00:04:36,861
Hello, Mother.

31
00:04:37,445 --> 00:04:38,863
How are you today?

32
00:04:40,365 --> 00:04:42,909
<i>Let's get you back to school
before another tutor quits.</i>

33
00:04:43,076 --> 00:04:46,621
But don't you think
it's time to start my training?

34
00:04:47,205 --> 00:04:49,040
Antiope thinks I'm ready.

35
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,042
Does she?

36
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,379
I could begin showing her some things.

37
00:04:56,214 --> 00:04:58,383
She should at least
be able to defend herself.

38
00:04:58,549 --> 00:04:59,592
From whom?

39
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,719
In the event of an invasion.

40
00:05:01,886 --> 00:05:05,223
<i>Isn't that why I have
the greatest warrior in our history</i>

41
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:07,725
leading an entire army, General?

42
00:05:08,893 --> 00:05:11,813
I pray a day will never come
where she has to fight.

43
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:15,066
But you know,
a scorpion must sting,

44
00:05:15,233 --> 00:05:17,819
<i>- a wolf must hunt—</i>
- She is a child.

45
00:05:17,986 --> 00:05:19,986
<i>The only child on the island.
Please let her be so.</i>

46
00:05:20,113 --> 00:05:21,114
<i>But, Mother...</i>

47
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,824
There will be no training.

48
00:05:30,748 --> 00:05:32,208
<i>What if I promised to be careful?</i>

49
00:05:33,334 --> 00:05:34,919
It's time to sleep.

50
00:05:36,713 --> 00:05:39,007
What if I didn't use a sword?

51
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,843
Fighting does not make you a hero.

52
00:05:42,427 --> 00:05:44,762
Just a shield then. No sharp edges.

53
00:05:44,929 --> 00:05:49,100
Diana, you are the most
precious thing in the world to me.

54
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:53,980
I wished for you so much so,
I sculpted you from clay myself

55
00:05:54,147 --> 00:05:56,691
and begged Zeus to give you life.

56
00:05:56,858 --> 00:05:58,651
You've told me this story.

57
00:05:59,235 --> 00:06:02,655
Which is why tonight
I will tell you a new one.

58
00:06:03,281 --> 00:06:06,451
A story of our people,
and my days of battle.

59
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:07,618
Yes!

60
00:06:07,785 --> 00:06:11,289
So you will finally understand
why war is nothing to hope for.

61
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:20,339
Long ago, when time was new

62
00:06:21,007 --> 00:06:23,968
and all of history was still a dream,

63
00:06:24,135 --> 00:06:26,471
<i>the Gods ruled the Earth,</i>

64
00:06:26,637 --> 00:06:29,307
<i>Zeus king among them.</i>

65
00:06:31,851 --> 00:06:35,021
<i>Zeus created beings
over which the Gods would rule.</i>

66
00:06:35,563 --> 00:06:38,066
<i>Beings born in his image,</i>

67
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:41,903
<i>fair and good,
strong and passionate.</i>

68
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:46,741
He called his creation "man."
And mankind was good.

69
00:06:47,742 --> 00:06:50,912
But Zeus's son
grew envious of mankind

70
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:54,332
and sought to corrupt
his father's creation.

71
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:58,836
<i>This was Ares, the God of War.</i>

72
00:07:01,005 --> 00:07:05,218
Ares poisoned men's hearts
with jealousy and suspicion.

73
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:07,512
<i>He turned them against one another</i>

74
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:10,681
<i>and war ravaged the Earth.</i>

75
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:15,728
<i>So, the Gods created us, the Amazons,</i>

76
00:07:15,895 --> 00:07:18,523
<i>to influence men's hearts with love</i>

77
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:21,192
<i>and restore peace to the Earth.</i>

78
00:07:24,237 --> 00:07:27,365
<i>And for a brief time, there was peace.</i>

79
00:07:33,246 --> 00:07:34,747
<i>But it did not last.</i>

80
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:45,091
<i>Your mother, the Amazon Queen,
led a revolt</i>

81
00:07:45,258 --> 00:07:48,219
<i>that freed us all from enslavement.</i>

82
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:58,479
<i>When Zeus led the Gods to our defense,</i>

83
00:07:58,646 --> 00:08:01,899
<i>Ares killed them one by one,</i>

84
00:08:02,066 --> 00:08:05,236
<i>until only Zeus himself remained.</i>

85
00:08:06,571 --> 00:08:10,950
<i>Zeus used the last of his power
to stop Ares,</i>

86
00:08:11,784 --> 00:08:16,581
<i>striking such a blow,
the God of War was forced to retreat.</i>

87
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:18,916
<i>But Zeus knew</i>

88
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:23,254
<i>that one day, Ares might return
to finish his mission.</i>

89
00:08:23,838 --> 00:08:26,299
<i>An endless war,</i>

90
00:08:26,465 --> 00:08:29,468
<i>where mankind would finally
destroy themselves,</i>

91
00:08:29,635 --> 00:08:32,430
<i>and us with them.</i>

92
00:08:32,597 --> 00:08:35,016
<i>So Zeus left us a weapon,</i>

93
00:08:35,183 --> 00:08:38,269
<i>one powerful enough to kill a God.</i>

94
00:08:39,437 --> 00:08:43,441
<i>With his dying breath,
Zeus created this island</i>

95
00:08:43,608 --> 00:08:45,860
<i>to hide us from the outside world,</i>

96
00:08:46,027 --> 00:08:48,362
<i>somewhere Ares could not find us.</i>

97
00:08:52,825 --> 00:08:55,119
<i>And all has been quiet ever since.</i>

98
00:09:02,835 --> 00:09:07,006
We give thanks to the Gods
for giving us this paradise.

99
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:10,468
And the Godkiller?

100
00:09:15,181 --> 00:09:16,182
The Godkiller?

101
00:09:16,349 --> 00:09:18,976
The weapon that's strong enough
to kill a god.

102
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:21,312
<i>Can I see it?</i>

103
00:09:31,364 --> 00:09:33,199
The Gods gave us many gifts.

104
00:09:33,866 --> 00:09:35,660
One day, you'll know them all.

105
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,080
This great tower is where we keep them.

106
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:52,677
The Godkiller.

107
00:09:56,514 --> 00:09:57,974
<i>It's beautiful.</i>

108
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:00,935
Who would wield it?

109
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:06,023
I pray it will never be called to arms.

110
00:10:06,732 --> 00:10:09,694
But only the fiercest among us
even could.

111
00:10:10,278 --> 00:10:12,071
And that is not you, Diana.

112
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:15,283
You see, you're safe,

113
00:10:15,783 --> 00:10:18,786
and there is nothing
you should concern yourself with.

114
00:10:32,341 --> 00:10:33,968
You keep doubting yourself, Diana.

115
00:10:34,135 --> 00:10:36,345
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

116
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:38,222
No, I don't.

117
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,420
You are stronger than you believe.

118
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:46,564
<i>You have greater powers than you know.</i>

119
00:10:46,731 --> 00:10:48,649
<i>- But if you don't try hard—
- Diana!</i>

120
00:11:00,411 --> 00:11:01,412
Are you hurt?

121
00:11:01,996 --> 00:11:03,164
No, Mother, I'm fine,

122
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:05,041
- I was just—
- Training.

123
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,045
It seems I'm not
the revered queen I should be.

124
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:11,422
Disobeyed, betrayed by my own sister...

125
00:11:11,589 --> 00:11:13,799
No, Mother.
It was me, I asked her to...

126
00:11:13,966 --> 00:11:15,176
Take her to the palace.

127
00:11:17,011 --> 00:11:18,012
Off you go.

128
00:11:26,604 --> 00:11:28,731
You left me no choice, Hippolyta.

129
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,152
You neglect your duty
if she cannot fight.

130
00:11:33,319 --> 00:11:35,404
You speak of a time that may never come.

131
00:11:36,989 --> 00:11:38,491
He might never return.

132
00:11:39,575 --> 00:11:41,369
He could have died from his wounds.

133
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:44,455
Ares is alive.

134
00:11:44,622 --> 00:11:47,958
You feel it, as I do, in your bones.

135
00:11:48,584 --> 00:11:51,253
It is only a matter of time
before he returns.

136
00:11:55,174 --> 00:11:59,011
The stronger she gets,
the sooner he'll find her.

137
00:11:59,178 --> 00:12:01,931
Hippolyta, I love her as you do.

138
00:12:03,474 --> 00:12:06,394
But this is the only way
to truly protect her.

139
00:12:17,446 --> 00:12:20,866
You will train her harder than
any Amazon before her.

140
00:12:21,617 --> 00:12:23,452
<i>Five times harder,</i>

141
00:12:23,619 --> 00:12:25,663
<i>ten times harder.</i>

142
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:28,749
<i>Until she is better than even you.</i>

143
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,293
<i>But she must never know the truth</i>

144
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,212
<i>about what she is</i>

145
00:12:33,379 --> 00:12:35,214
<i>or how she came to be.</i>

146
00:13:29,852 --> 00:13:31,103
Harder.

147
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:34,064
<i>You're stronger than this, Diana.</i>

148
00:13:34,273 --> 00:13:35,399
Again.

149
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:54,001
Never let your guard down.

150
00:13:55,211 --> 00:13:56,962
You expect the battle to be fair.

151
00:13:57,129 --> 00:13:58,547
A battle will never be fair.

152
00:14:12,478 --> 00:14:13,479
Antiope!

153
00:14:15,397 --> 00:14:16,398
Lay still.

154
00:14:16,774 --> 00:14:17,775
You are bleeding.

155
00:14:19,527 --> 00:14:21,779
- I'm sorry...
- Wait, Diana, wait.

156
00:14:28,077 --> 00:14:29,245
What have I done?

157
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,164
I'm sorry.

158
00:17:03,774 --> 00:17:05,776
<i>Where did this fog come from?</i>

159
00:17:09,655 --> 00:17:12,199
There. Go forward!

160
00:17:29,341 --> 00:17:31,427
<i>There he is! The pilot! I can see him.</i>

161
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:32,803
He's there!

162
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:04,668
Wow.

163
00:18:07,755 --> 00:18:09,089
You're a man.

164
00:18:13,594 --> 00:18:16,346
Yeah. I mean...

165
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:20,017
Do I not look like one?

166
00:18:24,605 --> 00:18:25,814
Where are we?

167
00:18:26,356 --> 00:18:27,858
Themyscira.

168
00:18:28,025 --> 00:18:29,276
Therma-what?

169
00:18:29,777 --> 00:18:30,778
Who are you?

170
00:18:39,161 --> 00:18:41,789
I'm one of the good guys,
and those are the bad guys.

171
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:42,998
What?

172
00:18:43,165 --> 00:18:45,018
The Germans. Come on,
we need to get out of here.

173
00:18:45,042 --> 00:18:47,169
- The Germans?
<i>- Diana!</i>

174
00:18:47,336 --> 00:18:49,546
Step away from her, now!

175
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:53,050
<i>Ready your bows!</i>

176
00:18:56,553 --> 00:18:57,888
They have guns, right?

177
00:18:58,055 --> 00:18:59,640
Fire!

178
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:02,392
Fire!

179
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:04,895
Come on!

180
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:43,076
Stay there!

181
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:22,199
Shield!

182
00:21:43,387 --> 00:21:45,138
No!

183
00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:46,306
No!

184
00:21:52,187 --> 00:21:53,563
No.

185
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:57,693
No, no. Antiope. Antiope.

186
00:21:57,859 --> 00:22:00,529
Antiope, hey. Hey, hey.

187
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:03,323
Hey.

188
00:22:03,907 --> 00:22:04,908
- Diana.
- Be still.

189
00:22:06,743 --> 00:22:08,203
The time has come.

190
00:22:09,413 --> 00:22:11,415
You... You must...

191
00:22:11,581 --> 00:22:14,751
What? What, Antiope?

192
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,257
Godkiller.

193
00:22:20,841 --> 00:22:22,884
- Diana, go...
- Go where?

194
00:22:23,677 --> 00:22:25,012
- Go where?
- Go...

195
00:22:25,178 --> 00:22:28,056
No, please, no. No. No!

196
00:22:28,223 --> 00:22:30,183
No, no, no.

197
00:22:30,976 --> 00:22:32,811
- No!
- Antiope!

198
00:22:34,396 --> 00:22:35,564
No!

199
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:44,114
- You.
- No.

200
00:22:45,532 --> 00:22:47,034
No, Mother, no.

201
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,952
He fought at my side
against the invaders.

202
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:50,954
What man fights against his own people?

203
00:22:51,121 --> 00:22:53,957
- These aren't my people.
- Then why do you wear their colors?

204
00:22:56,084 --> 00:22:57,085
I can't tell you that.

205
00:22:57,252 --> 00:22:58,295
You need to tell us now!

206
00:22:58,462 --> 00:22:59,504
What is your name?

207
00:23:00,881 --> 00:23:02,257
I can't tell you that either.

208
00:23:03,091 --> 00:23:05,886
We should kill him now,
and be done with it.

209
00:23:06,053 --> 00:23:07,054
<i>If he dies,</i>

210
00:23:07,721 --> 00:23:12,392
we know nothing about who they are,
and why they came.

211
00:23:19,983 --> 00:23:21,735
My, uh,

212
00:23:23,153 --> 00:23:27,657
name is Captain Steve Trevor,
pilot, American Expeditionary Forces.

213
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:30,952
Serial number 8141921.

214
00:23:31,161 --> 00:23:33,371
That's all I'm at liberty to...

215
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:39,503
Assigned to British Intelligence.

216
00:23:41,296 --> 00:23:42,964
What the hell is this thing?

217
00:23:43,131 --> 00:23:46,176
The Lasso of Hestia compels you
to reveal the truth.

218
00:23:46,718 --> 00:23:48,178
But it's really hot.

219
00:23:48,345 --> 00:23:51,348
It is pointless, and painful, to resist.

220
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:53,308
What is your mission?

221
00:23:53,475 --> 00:23:57,270
Whoever you are,
you are in more danger than you think.

222
00:23:57,437 --> 00:23:58,480
What is your mission?

223
00:24:01,858 --> 00:24:02,859
I am a...

224
00:24:07,531 --> 00:24:08,532
I am a...

225
00:24:11,868 --> 00:24:13,203
I am a spy.

226
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:19,000
I'm a spy. I'm a spy.

227
00:24:21,753 --> 00:24:23,046
<i>British Intelligence got word</i>

228
00:24:23,213 --> 00:24:25,674
<i>that the leader of the German Army,
General Ludendorff,</i>

229
00:24:25,841 --> 00:24:29,719
<i>would be visiting a secret military
installation in the Ottoman Empire.</i>

230
00:24:29,886 --> 00:24:33,056
<i>I posed as one of their pilots,
and flew in with them.</i>

231
00:24:33,223 --> 00:24:36,726
<i>According to our intel,
the Germans had no troops left,</i>

232
00:24:36,893 --> 00:24:39,563
<i>no money, no munitions of any kind.</i>

233
00:24:39,729 --> 00:24:41,064
<i>But our intel was wrong.</i>

234
00:24:41,231 --> 00:24:43,942
<i>The Germans had the Turks
building bombs for them.</i>

235
00:24:44,109 --> 00:24:47,237
<i>And not just bombs, new weapons.</i>

236
00:24:47,404 --> 00:24:48,989
<i>Secret weapons.</i>

237
00:24:50,448 --> 00:24:55,203
<i>Invented by Ludendorff's
chief psychopath, Dr. Isabel Maru.</i>

238
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:59,082
<i>The boys in the trenches
called her "Dr. Poison."</i>

239
00:25:00,584 --> 00:25:01,710
<i>And for good reason.</i>

240
00:25:30,572 --> 00:25:34,075
<i>From what I could tell, if Dr. Maru
was able to complete her work,</i>

241
00:25:34,242 --> 00:25:37,287
<i>millions more would die.
The war would never end.</i>

242
00:25:37,954 --> 00:25:40,040
<i>I was there to observe and report,
nothing more,</i>

243
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,585
<i>but I had to do something.</i>

244
00:25:48,673 --> 00:25:49,966
<i>I'm so close.</i>

245
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:53,178
<i>I know I can make the gas
penetrate the mask.</i>

246
00:25:53,345 --> 00:25:55,555
I just... I need more time.

247
00:25:55,722 --> 00:25:57,602
Unfortunately, Doctor,
we do not have more time.

248
00:25:57,641 --> 00:25:59,559
This work, this...

249
00:26:04,898 --> 00:26:06,149
Get that man!

250
00:26:06,316 --> 00:26:07,525
<i>There!</i>

251
00:27:01,538 --> 00:27:04,958
But if I can get these notes back
to British Intelligence in time,

252
00:27:05,709 --> 00:27:08,295
it could stop millions more from dying.

253
00:27:09,296 --> 00:27:11,214
It could stop the war.

254
00:27:11,381 --> 00:27:13,508
War? What war?

255
00:27:15,719 --> 00:27:17,137
The war.

256
00:27:20,056 --> 00:27:22,559
The war to end all wars.

257
00:27:23,893 --> 00:27:25,603
<i>Four years,</i>

258
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:28,023
<i>27 countries,</i>

259
00:27:28,189 --> 00:27:30,150
25 million dead,

260
00:27:30,734 --> 00:27:32,736
<i>soldiers and civilians.</i>

261
00:27:32,902 --> 00:27:34,821
Innocent people,

262
00:27:35,739 --> 00:27:37,991
women and children slaughtered.

263
00:27:39,326 --> 00:27:42,829
<i>Their homes and their villages
looted and burned.</i>

264
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:49,169
Weapons far deadlier than you can

265
00:27:52,088 --> 00:27:53,590
ever imagine.

266
00:27:57,927 --> 00:27:59,679
It's like nothing I've ever seen.

267
00:28:01,097 --> 00:28:02,849
<i>It's like the world's going to end.</i>

268
00:28:05,101 --> 00:28:06,353
Should we let him go?

269
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:09,105
And risk him bringing
more men to our shores?

270
00:28:09,272 --> 00:28:11,358
We cannot hold him forever, my queen.

271
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:13,610
Mother. Excuse me,

272
00:28:13,777 --> 00:28:17,614
but after everything the man said,
this must be Ares.

273
00:28:17,781 --> 00:28:19,141
What are you talking about, child?

274
00:28:19,199 --> 00:28:22,202
Forgive me, Senator,
but the man called it "a war without end."

275
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:25,288
Millions of people already dead.

276
00:28:25,789 --> 00:28:27,707
Like nothing he's ever seen.

277
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:30,293
Only Ares could do such a thing.

278
00:28:32,295 --> 00:28:35,382
We cannot simply let him go.
We must go with him.

279
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:38,361
I will not deploy our army
and leave Themyscira defenseless

280
00:28:38,385 --> 00:28:39,427
to go and fight their war.

281
00:28:39,594 --> 00:28:41,471
It is not their war.

282
00:28:41,638 --> 00:28:44,808
Zeus created man to be
just and wise, strong and passionate...

283
00:28:44,974 --> 00:28:47,394
That was a story, Diana!

284
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,000
There is much you do not understand.

285
00:28:49,062 --> 00:28:50,105
Men are easily corrupted.

286
00:28:50,271 --> 00:28:53,066
Yes, but Ares is behind that corruption!

287
00:28:53,233 --> 00:28:56,111
It is Ares who has
these Germans fighting.

288
00:28:56,277 --> 00:29:00,323
<i>And stopping the God of War
is our foreordinance.</i>

289
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:02,909
As Amazons, this is our duty.

290
00:29:03,076 --> 00:29:05,912
But you are not an Amazon
like the rest of us.

291
00:29:06,955 --> 00:29:08,415
So you will do nothing.

292
00:29:09,082 --> 00:29:10,162
As your queen, I forbid it.

293
00:29:23,346 --> 00:29:24,514
Strange.

294
00:29:26,349 --> 00:29:28,309
Is it true you saved his life?

295
00:29:28,852 --> 00:29:29,853
Who told you that?

296
00:29:30,019 --> 00:29:31,020
He did.

297
00:29:54,377 --> 00:29:55,378
Whoa! I...

298
00:29:57,964 --> 00:29:59,549
I didn't see you come in.

299
00:30:04,888 --> 00:30:07,724
Would you say you're a

300
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:11,144
typical example of your sex?

301
00:30:11,769 --> 00:30:13,438
I am

302
00:30:16,691 --> 00:30:18,401
above average.

303
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,156
What's that?

304
00:30:25,074 --> 00:30:26,493
It's a...

305
00:30:28,536 --> 00:30:29,537
Oh! Um...

306
00:30:31,748 --> 00:30:33,666
It's a watch.

307
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:35,084
A watch?

308
00:30:35,251 --> 00:30:36,252
<i>Yeah, it's a watch.</i>

309
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:37,837
It tells time.

310
00:30:38,838 --> 00:30:40,840
My father gave it to me.

311
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:44,150
It's been through hell and back
with him.

312
00:30:45,512 --> 00:30:48,473
Now it's with me,
and good thing it's still ticking.

313
00:30:49,516 --> 00:30:50,517
What for?

314
00:30:52,435 --> 00:30:54,020
Because it tells time.

315
00:30:55,438 --> 00:30:57,941
When to eat, sleep, wake up, work.

316
00:30:59,609 --> 00:31:02,487
You let this little thing
tell you what to do?

317
00:31:02,654 --> 00:31:04,113
Yeah.

318
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,121
Can I ask you some questions?

319
00:31:13,581 --> 00:31:14,958
<i>- Where are we?</i>
- Themyscira.

320
00:31:15,124 --> 00:31:18,628
No, I got that before.
But I mean, where are we?

321
00:31:19,921 --> 00:31:21,357
What is this place?
Who are you people?

322
00:31:21,381 --> 00:31:23,466
Why does the water do that?

323
00:31:23,633 --> 00:31:26,278
<i>How come you don't know what a watch is?
How come you speak English so well?</i>

324
00:31:26,302 --> 00:31:28,429
We speak hundreds of languages.

325
00:31:29,305 --> 00:31:32,684
We are the bridge to
a greater understanding between all men.

326
00:31:34,894 --> 00:31:35,979
Right.

327
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,652
You know, I didn't get a chance
to say this, uh, earlier,

328
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:48,324
but thank you for dragging me
out of the water.

329
00:31:49,742 --> 00:31:51,160
Thank you

330
00:31:51,744 --> 00:31:53,830
for what you did on the beach.

331
00:32:01,963 --> 00:32:02,964
So,

332
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,717
you're here to let me go?

333
00:32:07,135 --> 00:32:10,680
I tried, but it's not up to me.

334
00:32:11,222 --> 00:32:13,016
I even asked them to send me with you.

335
00:32:15,518 --> 00:32:16,936
Or anyone.

336
00:32:17,103 --> 00:32:18,146
An Amazon.

337
00:32:18,313 --> 00:32:19,981
The Amazons.

338
00:32:20,148 --> 00:32:21,608
The Amazons?

339
00:32:21,774 --> 00:32:24,527
<i>It is our sacred duty
to defend the world.</i>

340
00:32:25,194 --> 00:32:27,030
And I wish to go.

341
00:32:29,699 --> 00:32:31,909
But my mother will not allow it.

342
00:32:34,329 --> 00:32:35,330
Well,

343
00:32:36,873 --> 00:32:38,875
I can't say I blame her.

344
00:32:39,042 --> 00:32:40,082
<i>The way this war is going,</i>

345
00:32:40,209 --> 00:32:43,129
I wouldn't want to
let anyone I care about near it.

346
00:32:43,296 --> 00:32:45,214
Then why do you want to go back?

347
00:32:45,757 --> 00:32:47,800
I don't think "want" is the word.

348
00:32:49,677 --> 00:32:52,180
I guess I gotta try.

349
00:32:54,057 --> 00:32:56,142
My father told me once,

350
00:32:56,309 --> 00:32:58,669
he said, "If you see something wrong
happening in the world,

351
00:32:58,811 --> 00:33:01,522
"you can either do nothing,
or you can do something."

352
00:33:03,566 --> 00:33:05,401
And I already tried "nothing."

353
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:45,353
Nice outfit.

354
00:35:46,646 --> 00:35:47,730
Oh, thank you.

355
00:35:48,481 --> 00:35:51,484
Now, I will show you
the way off the island

356
00:35:52,068 --> 00:35:53,611
and you will take me to Ares.

357
00:35:54,445 --> 00:35:55,446
Deal.

358
00:36:04,622 --> 00:36:05,998
I'm leaving in that?

359
00:36:06,165 --> 00:36:07,416
We are.

360
00:36:08,835 --> 00:36:10,837
Yeah, we're leaving in that?

361
00:36:11,003 --> 00:36:12,463
Do you not know how to sail?

362
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:13,790
Of course I know how to sail.

363
00:36:13,923 --> 00:36:15,683
Why wouldn't I know how to sail?
It's just...

364
00:36:16,634 --> 00:36:17,969
It's been a while.

365
00:36:47,456 --> 00:36:48,958
I'm going, Mother.

366
00:36:49,584 --> 00:36:52,753
I cannot stand by
while innocent lives are lost.

367
00:36:53,629 --> 00:36:58,050
If no one else will defend the world
from Ares, then I must.

368
00:36:59,844 --> 00:37:01,178
I have to go.

369
00:37:01,345 --> 00:37:02,722
I know.

370
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:06,225
<i>Or at least I know I cannot stop you.</i>

371
00:37:11,939 --> 00:37:13,691
There is so much...

372
00:37:14,734 --> 00:37:15,943
So much you do not understand.

373
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:17,570
<i>I understand enough.</i>

374
00:37:17,737 --> 00:37:21,282
That I'm willing to fight for those
who cannot fight for themselves.

375
00:37:23,993 --> 00:37:25,494
Like you once did.

376
00:37:26,162 --> 00:37:28,080
You know that if you choose to leave,

377
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:31,167
you may never return.

378
00:37:33,085 --> 00:37:35,004
Who will I be if I stay?

379
00:37:43,888 --> 00:37:46,849
This belonged to
the greatest warrior in our history,

380
00:37:47,433 --> 00:37:50,019
our beloved Antiope.

381
00:37:50,186 --> 00:37:52,313
Make sure you are worthy of it.

382
00:37:53,898 --> 00:37:55,149
I will.

383
00:37:58,235 --> 00:38:00,738
Be careful in the world of men, Diana.

384
00:38:02,281 --> 00:38:04,659
They do not deserve you.

385
00:38:09,246 --> 00:38:12,208
You have been my greatest love.

386
00:38:16,295 --> 00:38:17,505
Today,

387
00:38:19,548 --> 00:38:21,550
you are my greatest sorrow.

388
00:39:00,423 --> 00:39:01,799
Should you have told her?

389
00:39:02,675 --> 00:39:07,138
The more she knows,
the sooner he'll find her.

390
00:39:18,774 --> 00:39:20,651
How long until we reach the war?

391
00:39:21,861 --> 00:39:23,988
The war? Which part?

392
00:39:24,155 --> 00:39:25,406
The Western Front in France

393
00:39:25,573 --> 00:39:27,950
is 400 miles long
from the Alps to the North Sea.

394
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,537
Where the fighting
is the most intense, then.

395
00:39:31,704 --> 00:39:34,582
If you take me there,
I'm sure I'll find Ares.

396
00:39:38,502 --> 00:39:40,880
Ares? As in, the God of War?

397
00:39:41,047 --> 00:39:45,134
The God of War is our responsibility.
Only an Amazon can defeat him.

398
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:47,636
With this.

399
00:39:49,096 --> 00:39:50,264
And once I do,

400
00:39:50,806 --> 00:39:52,433
the war will end.

401
00:39:59,565 --> 00:40:01,650
Look, I appreciate your spirit,

402
00:40:02,318 --> 00:40:04,361
<i>but this war is...</i>

403
00:40:04,528 --> 00:40:06,739
It's a great big mess.

404
00:40:07,615 --> 00:40:10,409
And there's not a whole lot
you and I can do about that.

405
00:40:10,576 --> 00:40:13,296
I mean, we can get back to London,
and try to get to the men who can.

406
00:40:13,329 --> 00:40:15,414
I'm the man who can!

407
00:40:15,581 --> 00:40:17,374
And once I find and destroy Ares,

408
00:40:17,541 --> 00:40:20,169
the German armies
will be freed from his influence

409
00:40:20,336 --> 00:40:23,339
and they will be good men again,
and the world will be better.

410
00:40:27,843 --> 00:40:28,844
Great.

411
00:40:29,762 --> 00:40:30,846
You'll see.

412
00:40:34,308 --> 00:40:35,351
What are you doing?

413
00:40:35,768 --> 00:40:37,853
Oh, I thought maybe you'd want to

414
00:40:39,271 --> 00:40:40,397
get some sleep.

415
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:46,529
And what about you?
Are you not sleeping?

416
00:40:46,695 --> 00:40:48,364
Does the average man not sleep?

417
00:40:52,493 --> 00:40:55,621
Yes, we sleep.
We just don't sleep with, uh...

418
00:40:55,788 --> 00:40:56,868
You don't sleep with women?

419
00:40:56,956 --> 00:40:59,875
No. I mean, I do sleep with...
I sleep with...

420
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:02,628
Yes, I do.

421
00:41:02,795 --> 00:41:05,256
But, out of the, uh,

422
00:41:05,464 --> 00:41:07,842
confines of marriage

423
00:41:08,008 --> 00:41:09,426
it's just...

424
00:41:11,887 --> 00:41:13,889
It's not polite to assume, you know?

425
00:41:17,643 --> 00:41:19,103
"Marriage"?

426
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:21,188
Marriage. Do you not have that on...

427
00:41:22,439 --> 00:41:23,816
You go before a judge

428
00:41:23,983 --> 00:41:28,154
and you swear to love,
honor and cherish each other

429
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,446
until death do you part.

430
00:41:30,322 --> 00:41:32,575
And do they?
Love each other till death?

431
00:41:32,741 --> 00:41:34,493
Not very often, no.

432
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,078
Then why do they do it?

433
00:41:36,871 --> 00:41:39,331
I have no idea.

434
00:41:40,166 --> 00:41:41,977
So, you cannot sleep with me
unless I marry you.

435
00:41:42,001 --> 00:41:44,321
I will sleep with you, if you want.
I'll sleep right there.

436
00:41:44,378 --> 00:41:45,462
<i>There's plenty of room.</i>

437
00:41:45,629 --> 00:41:48,174
- Then, fine, if you don't mind...
- No, it's up to you.

438
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:50,902
I know it's up to me, I'm making
the choice. I will come sleep with you.

439
00:41:50,926 --> 00:41:51,927
Okay.

440
00:41:54,805 --> 00:41:55,973
Yeah, just...

441
00:41:57,266 --> 00:41:58,475
Okay.

442
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:18,120
You know, where I come from,
I'm not considered average.

443
00:42:18,871 --> 00:42:21,081
You know, being a spy,

444
00:42:21,248 --> 00:42:24,543
you have to show a certain amount of

445
00:42:26,587 --> 00:42:27,796
vigor.

446
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:34,303
Have you never met a man before?
What about your father?

447
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:36,222
I had no father.

448
00:42:36,889 --> 00:42:38,515
My mother sculpted me from clay

449
00:42:38,682 --> 00:42:40,809
and I was brought to life by Zeus.

450
00:42:44,188 --> 00:42:45,648
Well, that's neat.

451
00:42:49,235 --> 00:42:50,653
<i>Sorry.</i>

452
00:42:53,155 --> 00:42:54,657
Where I come from,

453
00:42:55,908 --> 00:42:58,202
babies are made differently.

454
00:42:59,203 --> 00:43:01,038
You refer to reproductive biology.

455
00:43:01,205 --> 00:43:02,790
- Yes, yes.
- Yeah, I know.

456
00:43:03,582 --> 00:43:05,125
I know all about that.

457
00:43:05,292 --> 00:43:08,128
I mean, I refer to that,
and other things.

458
00:43:09,046 --> 00:43:10,339
The pleasures of the flesh.

459
00:43:13,217 --> 00:43:15,135
Do you know about that?

460
00:43:16,303 --> 00:43:20,099
I've read all 12 volumes of Clio's
<i>Treatises on Bodily Pleasure.</i>

461
00:43:21,934 --> 00:43:23,978
- All 12, huh?
<i>- Mmm-hmm.</i>

462
00:43:28,607 --> 00:43:30,067
Did you bring any of those with you?

463
00:43:30,693 --> 00:43:31,860
You would not enjoy them.

464
00:43:32,027 --> 00:43:33,362
I don't know. Maybe.

465
00:43:33,529 --> 00:43:34,655
<i>No, you wouldn't.</i>

466
00:43:34,822 --> 00:43:36,198
Why not?

467
00:43:36,365 --> 00:43:39,493
They came to the conclusion that men
are essential for procreation,

468
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:41,537
but when it comes to pleasure,

469
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:43,789
unnecessary.

470
00:43:43,956 --> 00:43:45,457
No, no.

471
00:43:50,087 --> 00:43:51,088
Good night.

472
00:43:51,297 --> 00:43:52,548
Night.

473
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:06,687
How long until we are operational?

474
00:44:06,854 --> 00:44:08,063
Two days, sir.

475
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:09,898
You have until tonight, Captain.

476
00:44:10,065 --> 00:44:14,194
Sir, the men have had no food,
no sleep.

477
00:44:14,361 --> 00:44:16,530
Do you think I have had
any food or rest, Captain?

478
00:44:16,989 --> 00:44:18,615
Do you hear me making excuses?

479
00:44:18,782 --> 00:44:19,783
No.

480
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:21,410
Your men are weak, complacent.

481
00:44:21,577 --> 00:44:24,538
You've let them forget that
an attack can happen at any time,

482
00:44:24,705 --> 00:44:26,123
from any quarter!

483
00:44:26,290 --> 00:44:27,570
So, let's you and I remind them,

484
00:44:27,624 --> 00:44:28,625
shall we?

485
00:44:43,432 --> 00:44:45,225
- Doctor.
- General.

486
00:44:45,392 --> 00:44:46,393
Progress?

487
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,853
Not enough.

488
00:44:48,729 --> 00:44:50,689
It is over, General.

489
00:44:50,856 --> 00:44:52,733
Germany is giving up.

490
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:56,820
Von Hindenburg has recommended
the <i>Kaiser</i> sign the armistice.

491
00:44:56,987 --> 00:44:59,031
We have run out of time.

492
00:45:00,657 --> 00:45:03,452
As soon as the <i>Kaiser</i>
sees the newest weapon,

493
00:45:03,619 --> 00:45:05,329
he will not sign the armistice.

494
00:45:05,496 --> 00:45:06,580
But, without my book...

495
00:45:06,747 --> 00:45:07,998
We will get your book!

496
00:45:08,165 --> 00:45:10,626
It is you that I believe in. Not it.

497
00:45:12,002 --> 00:45:15,047
I know that you can,
and will, succeed. Hmm.

498
00:45:16,882 --> 00:45:20,219
It is what you were put on this earth
to do.

499
00:45:23,847 --> 00:45:27,267
Something did come to me last night.

500
00:45:27,434 --> 00:45:29,436
A different type of gas.

501
00:45:30,354 --> 00:45:31,438
For you.

502
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:33,982
<i>To restore your strength.</i>

503
00:46:04,096 --> 00:46:06,432
<i>I've got it. I've got it!</i>

504
00:46:07,015 --> 00:46:10,102
And if it's what I think,

505
00:46:11,270 --> 00:46:13,105
it's going to be

506
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:16,191
terrible.

507
00:46:37,504 --> 00:46:38,672
<i>Morning!</i>

508
00:46:39,173 --> 00:46:41,717
We got lucky, we caught a ride.
We made some good time.

509
00:46:41,884 --> 00:46:44,219
<i>Welcome to jolly old London!</i>

510
00:46:44,595 --> 00:46:46,013
It's hideous.

511
00:46:46,555 --> 00:46:48,015
Yeah, it's not for everybody.

512
00:47:10,412 --> 00:47:11,872
- Morning, darling.
- What a beauty.

513
00:47:12,039 --> 00:47:13,040
Hello, beautiful!

514
00:47:13,207 --> 00:47:15,709
Gentlemen, eyes to yourself.
Thank you so much.

515
00:47:17,669 --> 00:47:19,630
Come on! Come on.

516
00:47:21,173 --> 00:47:22,758
Why are they holding hands?

517
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:25,802
Uh, probably because they're together.

518
00:47:28,555 --> 00:47:31,099
No, no, no. We're not together.
I mean, in that way.

519
00:47:31,266 --> 00:47:32,267
This way.

520
00:47:32,434 --> 00:47:33,644
To the war!

521
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:36,498
Well, technically, the war is that way.
But we gotta go this way first.

522
00:47:36,522 --> 00:47:38,023
And where are we going?

523
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:39,942
We gotta get this notebook
to my superiors.

524
00:47:40,108 --> 00:47:41,193
Hey, hey, hey!

525
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:44,488
No, no, no.
I let you go, you take me to Ares.

526
00:47:44,655 --> 00:47:46,406
We made a deal, Steve Trevor.

527
00:47:46,573 --> 00:47:47,950
And a deal is a promise.

528
00:47:48,116 --> 00:47:49,952
And a promise is unbreakable.

529
00:47:50,702 --> 00:47:52,788
Oh, boy. Damn it. All right.

530
00:47:54,039 --> 00:47:55,874
You come with me first
to deliver this,

531
00:47:56,041 --> 00:47:58,335
and then we'll get you a ticket,
uh...

532
00:47:58,585 --> 00:47:59,670
to the war.

533
00:47:59,962 --> 00:48:00,963
Deal?

534
00:48:02,464 --> 00:48:03,590
- Let's go.
- Diana...

535
00:48:03,757 --> 00:48:04,758
What are you doing?

536
00:48:04,925 --> 00:48:07,028
You can't do that because
you're not wearing any clothes.

537
00:48:07,052 --> 00:48:10,305
Let's go...
Let's go buy you some clothes.

538
00:48:10,472 --> 00:48:12,266
What do these women wear into battle?

539
00:48:12,432 --> 00:48:13,809
They don't, uh...

540
00:48:14,017 --> 00:48:15,602
A baby!

541
00:48:16,979 --> 00:48:18,373
- No, no, no. No babies.
- Oh... Oh...

542
00:48:18,397 --> 00:48:20,065
No, please. No babies.

543
00:48:20,232 --> 00:48:22,025
That one's not made out of clay.

544
00:48:22,359 --> 00:48:23,443
Come on.

545
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:25,612
Diana! Please.

546
00:48:40,836 --> 00:48:43,338
Thank God! You're not dead!

547
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:46,466
Hoorah and huzzah!

548
00:48:46,633 --> 00:48:48,927
I did think you were dead
until I got your call, you know?

549
00:48:49,511 --> 00:48:51,722
<i>He's been gone for weeks.
Not a single word.</i>

550
00:48:51,888 --> 00:48:52,889
<i>Very unlike him.</i>

551
00:48:53,056 --> 00:48:55,475
I'm introducing myself.
It's Etta Candy.

552
00:48:55,642 --> 00:48:57,644
I'm Steve Trevor's secretary.

553
00:48:57,811 --> 00:48:59,146
What is a secretary?

554
00:48:59,313 --> 00:49:00,689
Ooh! Well, I do everything.

555
00:49:00,856 --> 00:49:03,296
I go where he tells me to go,
and I do what he tells me to do.

556
00:49:03,567 --> 00:49:05,986
Well, where I'm from,
that's called slavery.

557
00:49:06,153 --> 00:49:07,279
I really like her.

558
00:49:07,446 --> 00:49:08,655
Fantastic. Ladies, after you.

559
00:49:08,822 --> 00:49:09,990
Oh, I do, I like her.

560
00:49:10,157 --> 00:49:12,075
And it does rather feel like that,

561
00:49:12,242 --> 00:49:13,785
except the pay is very good.

562
00:49:13,952 --> 00:49:16,288
We've got our work cut out for us,
haven't we?

563
00:49:18,457 --> 00:49:22,377
Is this what passes for armor
in your country?

564
00:49:24,046 --> 00:49:25,213
"Armor." It's fashion.

565
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:26,840
Keeps our tummies in.

566
00:49:27,382 --> 00:49:28,634
Why must you keep them in?

567
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,053
Only a woman with no tummy
would ask that question.

568
00:49:32,763 --> 00:49:36,308
Conservative,
but not entirely un-fun.

569
00:49:37,559 --> 00:49:38,935
Try it on, at least.

570
00:49:39,102 --> 00:49:40,145
Very well.

571
00:49:41,438 --> 00:49:43,023
- Ooh! Ah, ah, ah...
- No! No, no, no.

572
00:49:43,398 --> 00:49:44,524
Ooh!

573
00:49:49,863 --> 00:49:51,406
Come on! Oh!

574
00:50:00,123 --> 00:50:02,918
How can a woman
possibly fight in this?

575
00:50:03,085 --> 00:50:04,169
Fight?

576
00:50:04,336 --> 00:50:05,921
We use our principles.

577
00:50:06,088 --> 00:50:07,928
I mean, that's how
we're going to get the vote.

578
00:50:07,964 --> 00:50:11,718
Although, I am not opposed to
engaging in a bit of fisticuffs,

579
00:50:11,885 --> 00:50:13,637
should the occasion arise.

580
00:50:14,971 --> 00:50:16,264
Lovely.

581
00:50:16,556 --> 00:50:17,557
Oop!

582
00:50:17,766 --> 00:50:20,185
It's itchy. It's choking me.

583
00:50:21,561 --> 00:50:23,647
Can't say I blame it.

584
00:50:23,814 --> 00:50:25,065
Etta.

585
00:50:25,232 --> 00:50:26,233
Where is she?

586
00:50:26,441 --> 00:50:28,777
Oh, she's trying on outfit number 226.

587
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:41,748
Miss Candy, the whole point
was to make her look less

588
00:50:41,915 --> 00:50:43,083
<i>distracting.</i>

589
00:50:45,419 --> 00:50:46,420
May I?

590
00:50:51,133 --> 00:50:52,467
<i>Really? Specs?</i>

591
00:50:52,634 --> 00:50:55,194
And suddenly she's not the most
beautiful woman you've ever seen?

592
00:51:01,435 --> 00:51:02,644
Better.

593
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:15,115
Yeah, that's not going to work.

594
00:51:15,282 --> 00:51:16,992
Please put the sword down, Diana.

595
00:51:17,159 --> 00:51:18,160
Diana!

596
00:51:19,411 --> 00:51:20,537
Let me try it by myself.

597
00:51:20,704 --> 00:51:21,788
After you, sir.

598
00:51:31,339 --> 00:51:32,340
Etta...

599
00:51:32,758 --> 00:51:35,093
Why don't I meet you
back at the office

600
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:37,345
and, meanwhile,
I'll take this for safekeeping.

601
00:51:37,512 --> 00:51:38,513
Oh, no, I don't think so.

602
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:40,432
You gotta put the sword down, Diana.
Please.

603
00:51:40,599 --> 00:51:41,993
- It doesn't go with the outfit.
- At all.

604
00:51:42,017 --> 00:51:44,644
Put the sword down, first of all.

605
00:51:47,063 --> 00:51:50,650
Promise me you will protect it
with your life.

606
00:51:51,193 --> 00:51:52,944
Yes... No.

607
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:55,238
You can trust her. Just hand that over.

608
00:51:55,405 --> 00:51:57,240
- Shield.
- And the shield to her.

609
00:51:57,407 --> 00:51:58,408
There we go. Whoa!

610
00:51:58,575 --> 00:51:59,576
You got it? Thanks, Etta.

611
00:51:59,743 --> 00:52:01,661
This is easy.

612
00:52:03,038 --> 00:52:04,414
Oh. There we go.

613
00:52:32,275 --> 00:52:33,276
What is it?

614
00:52:35,111 --> 00:52:37,531
Hopefully nothing. Come on.

615
00:52:47,207 --> 00:52:49,251
- Steve, why are we hiding?
- Shh! Come on, come on.

616
00:52:58,802 --> 00:53:00,470
Captain Trevor.

617
00:53:01,304 --> 00:53:04,432
I believe you have something that is
the property of General Ludendorff.

618
00:53:06,059 --> 00:53:08,728
Ah, it's the, uh, bad-guy convention.

619
00:53:08,937 --> 00:53:11,439
Give us Dr. Maru's notebook.

620
00:53:12,065 --> 00:53:13,567
Where did I put that thing?

621
00:53:14,609 --> 00:53:17,028
Stand back!

622
00:53:27,664 --> 00:53:28,748
Or maybe not.

623
00:53:44,806 --> 00:53:45,974
Tough luck.

624
00:53:52,147 --> 00:53:54,316
Is there anything else
you want to show me?

625
00:53:55,650 --> 00:53:56,930
Where do you think you're going?

626
00:53:59,404 --> 00:54:00,822
Oh!

627
00:54:03,575 --> 00:54:06,286
I'm sorry. But you are
clearly under his control.

628
00:54:06,453 --> 00:54:09,164
- Diana...
- Let me help you get free.

629
00:54:09,331 --> 00:54:10,874
Where will I find Ares?

630
00:54:18,214 --> 00:54:20,508
- He's... He's dead.
- Hmm.

631
00:54:21,217 --> 00:54:22,510
Cyanide.

632
00:54:31,353 --> 00:54:33,063
Stay here. I'll be right back.

633
00:54:33,229 --> 00:54:36,024
<i>Gentlemen! Gentlemen, please!</i>

634
00:54:36,858 --> 00:54:40,654
The sad truth is, the majority of them
don't even know what they're fighting for!

635
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:41,821
Let him speak!

636
00:54:41,988 --> 00:54:44,157
Yes, thank you. Gentlemen...

637
00:54:44,699 --> 00:54:48,745
Germany is an immensely proud nation.

638
00:54:50,038 --> 00:54:51,873
They will never surrender.

639
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:54,918
Now, look.
The only way to end this war...

640
00:54:55,085 --> 00:54:58,421
Colonel,
I have to talk to you outside.

641
00:54:58,588 --> 00:55:00,840
<i>...and restore world peace</i>

642
00:55:01,007 --> 00:55:02,550
is to negotiate

643
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:05,971
an armistice.

644
00:55:06,554 --> 00:55:08,974
<i>- There's a woman in here.
- Um...</i>

645
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:10,620
What's she doing in here?
Get her out.

646
00:55:12,477 --> 00:55:13,728
Get her out.

647
00:55:14,396 --> 00:55:15,438
Sorry.

648
00:55:15,605 --> 00:55:17,899
Blind sister.
She got lost on the way to the bathroom.

649
00:55:18,066 --> 00:55:20,068
I think it's this way.
Sorry, guys.

650
00:55:20,777 --> 00:55:22,946
Um...
Our only aim at this time

651
00:55:23,113 --> 00:55:25,740
must be to achieve peace,

652
00:55:25,907 --> 00:55:27,784
at any cost!

653
00:55:31,287 --> 00:55:33,581
Why do they not let him speak?
He's talking peace.

654
00:55:33,748 --> 00:55:35,250
Not right now. Sorry.

655
00:55:40,088 --> 00:55:42,942
Trevor, what the hell were you thinking,
bringing a woman into the Council Chamber?

656
00:55:42,966 --> 00:55:44,926
The intel that I brought back
is time-sensitive.

657
00:55:45,093 --> 00:55:46,533
This is one of Dr. Maru's notebooks.

658
00:55:46,678 --> 00:55:47,679
Notebook or not...

659
00:55:47,846 --> 00:55:48,990
We need to get it to cryptography

660
00:55:49,014 --> 00:55:50,741
and I need an immediate audience
with the generals.

661
00:55:50,765 --> 00:55:53,077
You do not just barge in here
and demand an audience with the Cabinet.

662
00:55:53,101 --> 00:55:54,787
Sir, with all due respect,
what I saw in my last mission

663
00:55:54,811 --> 00:55:55,997
could change the course of the war.

664
00:55:56,021 --> 00:55:57,439
<i>Captain Trevor!</i>

665
00:55:59,024 --> 00:56:00,793
I heard we'd lost you
on one of your missions,

666
00:56:00,817 --> 00:56:02,318
yet here you are,
back from the dead,

667
00:56:02,485 --> 00:56:04,404
and I see you've
brought a friend with you.

668
00:56:04,571 --> 00:56:06,090
Our deepest apologies
for the interruption, sir.

669
00:56:06,114 --> 00:56:07,741
No, no, no. Nonsense.

670
00:56:07,907 --> 00:56:09,617
Thanks to this young woman,

671
00:56:09,784 --> 00:56:13,288
the room was finally quiet enough for me
to get at least a few words in.

672
00:56:13,455 --> 00:56:15,331
Sir Patrick Morgan, at your service.

673
00:56:15,999 --> 00:56:17,959
Diana, Princess of Themys...

674
00:56:18,126 --> 00:56:19,961
"Prince." Diana Prince.

675
00:56:20,795 --> 00:56:21,838
She is, uh...

676
00:56:22,005 --> 00:56:23,006
And I...

677
00:56:23,173 --> 00:56:24,215
Are...

678
00:56:24,382 --> 00:56:25,383
Working together.

679
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:27,653
<i>She actually helped me
bring this, uh, notebook back here.</i>

680
00:56:27,677 --> 00:56:29,971
<i>That's from Dr. Maru's lab.</i>

681
00:56:30,138 --> 00:56:32,950
I think the information contained inside
will change the course of the war, sir.

682
00:56:32,974 --> 00:56:34,809
My God.

683
00:56:35,769 --> 00:56:37,812
- Dr. Poison, herself.
- Yes.

684
00:57:07,967 --> 00:57:09,010
<i>Yes.</i>

685
00:57:09,677 --> 00:57:11,096
<i>Intriguing.</i>

686
00:57:11,262 --> 00:57:12,555
Any further intelligence?

687
00:57:12,722 --> 00:57:15,767
Sadly not, sir.
Cryptography have had no luck.

688
00:57:15,934 --> 00:57:17,852
It seems like it's a mixture
of two languages,

689
00:57:18,061 --> 00:57:21,564
but, as yet, they've failed
to determine which two languages.

690
00:57:21,731 --> 00:57:23,358
Ottoman and Sumerian.

691
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:28,238
Surely, someone else in this room
knew that.

692
00:57:28,404 --> 00:57:29,489
Who is this woman?

693
00:57:29,656 --> 00:57:31,366
<i>She's my, um,</i>

694
00:57:32,033 --> 00:57:33,076
secretary, sir.

695
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:35,912
And she can understand
Ottoman and Sumerian?

696
00:57:36,496 --> 00:57:37,956
She's a very good secretary.

697
00:57:38,123 --> 00:57:39,541
See her out.

698
00:57:40,166 --> 00:57:42,836
Sir, if this woman can read it,

699
00:57:43,002 --> 00:57:44,838
<i>we should hear what she has to say.</i>

700
00:57:45,004 --> 00:57:46,714
Yes, very well.

701
00:57:52,595 --> 00:57:54,389
It's a formula

702
00:57:54,973 --> 00:57:56,432
for a new kind of gas.

703
00:57:57,016 --> 00:58:00,520
Mustard gas.
Hydrogen-based, instead of sulfur.

704
00:58:00,687 --> 00:58:01,771
Hydrogen-based...

705
00:58:01,938 --> 00:58:04,566
Gas masks would be useless
against hydrogen.

706
00:58:04,732 --> 00:58:07,569
The book says they plan to
release the gas

707
00:58:07,735 --> 00:58:09,070
at "the front"?

708
00:58:09,237 --> 00:58:10,238
When?

709
00:58:10,405 --> 00:58:11,573
It doesn't say.

710
00:58:12,031 --> 00:58:13,324
Wait. "Front" of what?

711
00:58:13,491 --> 00:58:14,492
Sir,

712
00:58:14,659 --> 00:58:16,452
that is the evidence we need.

713
00:58:16,619 --> 00:58:18,222
You have to find out
where they're making that gas.

714
00:58:18,246 --> 00:58:19,557
You have to burn it to the ground.

715
00:58:19,581 --> 00:58:20,582
Destroy it.

716
00:58:20,748 --> 00:58:23,293
Ludendorff was last seen in Belgium.

717
00:58:23,459 --> 00:58:27,589
We can't be seen sending troops
into German-occupied Belgium

718
00:58:27,755 --> 00:58:30,466
as we are negotiating their surrender.

719
00:58:30,633 --> 00:58:32,385
Sir, I've seen that gas
with my own eyes.

720
00:58:32,552 --> 00:58:35,305
If it is used,
it will kill everyone on both sides.

721
00:58:35,471 --> 00:58:36,514
They will all die.

722
00:58:36,681 --> 00:58:39,601
That is what soldiers do, Captain.

723
00:58:40,435 --> 00:58:42,187
<i>Send me in
with some logistical support.</i>

724
00:58:42,353 --> 00:58:45,481
At least give me the chance
to take out Ludendorff's operation myself.

725
00:58:45,648 --> 00:58:46,774
Are you insane?

726
00:58:46,941 --> 00:58:49,235
I can't introduce rogue elements
this late in the game.

727
00:58:49,402 --> 00:58:50,403
Sir, I can...

728
00:58:50,570 --> 00:58:51,779
<i>Now, more than ever,</i>

729
00:58:51,946 --> 00:58:55,617
the armistice
is of paramount importance.

730
00:58:55,783 --> 00:58:59,412
It must be negotiated, it must be signed,
and this is...

731
00:59:00,288 --> 00:59:02,957
Well, it's the best way
of stopping the war.

732
00:59:03,124 --> 00:59:05,126
Captain, you will do nothing.

733
00:59:05,293 --> 00:59:07,295
And that is an order.

734
00:59:08,254 --> 00:59:09,255
Yes, sir.

735
00:59:10,465 --> 00:59:11,466
I understand, sir.

736
00:59:12,425 --> 00:59:13,468
I don't!

737
00:59:13,927 --> 00:59:15,287
Diana, I know this is confusing...

738
00:59:15,428 --> 00:59:17,615
<i>- It is not confusing! It's unthinkable!</i>
- Who is this woman?

739
00:59:17,639 --> 00:59:18,782
She's with me. She's with us, sir.

740
00:59:18,806 --> 00:59:19,891
I am not with you!

741
00:59:20,058 --> 00:59:23,144
You would knowingly sacrifice
all those lives,

742
00:59:23,311 --> 00:59:24,455
as if they mean less than yours!

743
00:59:24,479 --> 00:59:26,290
- Diana, let's talk about this outside.
- As if they mean nothing?

744
00:59:26,314 --> 00:59:29,651
Where I come from, generals don't
hide in their offices like cowards.

745
00:59:29,817 --> 00:59:31,977
- That's enough!
- They fight alongside their soldiers.

746
00:59:32,111 --> 00:59:33,655
They die with them on the battlefield!

747
00:59:33,821 --> 00:59:35,341
- That's enough!
- You should be ashamed.

748
00:59:35,365 --> 00:59:37,285
- My apologies. Diana...
- You should be ashamed.

749
00:59:37,367 --> 00:59:39,007
<i>- Diana...
- All of you should be ashamed!</i>

750
00:59:40,161 --> 00:59:41,788
Please slow down!

751
00:59:41,955 --> 00:59:43,289
That's your leader?

752
00:59:43,456 --> 00:59:45,625
How could he say that?
Believe that?

753
00:59:45,792 --> 00:59:47,210
And you!

754
00:59:47,377 --> 00:59:49,170
Was your duty
to simply give them a book?

755
00:59:49,337 --> 00:59:50,338
No!

756
00:59:50,505 --> 00:59:51,815
You didn't stand your ground!
You didn't fight!

757
00:59:51,839 --> 00:59:53,442
Because there was no chance
of changing his mind!

758
00:59:53,466 --> 00:59:56,135
This is Ares, and he's not going to
allow a negotiation

759
00:59:56,302 --> 00:59:57,720
or a surrender!

760
00:59:57,887 --> 01:00:00,515
The millions of people you talked about,
they will die!

761
01:00:00,682 --> 01:00:02,141
We are going anyway!

762
01:00:04,686 --> 01:00:06,271
You mean, you were lying?

763
01:00:06,854 --> 01:00:08,648
I'm a spy! That's what I do!

764
01:00:08,815 --> 01:00:10,655
How do I know
you're not lying to me right now?

765
01:00:15,530 --> 01:00:17,031
I am taking you to the front.

766
01:00:17,699 --> 01:00:19,742
We are probably going to die.

767
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:22,704
This is a terrible idea.

768
01:00:27,375 --> 01:00:29,335
We're going to need reinforcements.

769
01:00:39,721 --> 01:00:41,180
These are the reinforcements?

770
01:00:41,347 --> 01:00:42,765
Yup.

771
01:00:43,182 --> 01:00:44,934
Are these even good men?

772
01:00:45,852 --> 01:00:47,061
Hmm. Relatively.

773
01:00:48,354 --> 01:00:52,066
Even in Africa, gentlemen,
we haven't seen such luxuries.

774
01:00:52,233 --> 01:00:56,529
But the luxury that we have now...
It's like we can't stop making money!

775
01:00:56,696 --> 01:00:58,948
So, my uncle, the prince, and I...

776
01:00:59,115 --> 01:01:01,326
Boy! Which prince is that?

777
01:01:01,868 --> 01:01:04,096
I decide to extend the opportunity
for a few good soldiers...

778
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:05,580
But, seriously, which prince?

779
01:01:06,414 --> 01:01:09,417
Hey, Sultan Angora Mynx Cashmere,

780
01:01:09,584 --> 01:01:11,252
<i>could I talk to you for a minute?</i>

781
01:01:11,586 --> 01:01:13,755
Gentlemen, excuse me one second.

782
01:01:14,505 --> 01:01:15,506
"Bar." Well, a "pub."

783
01:01:15,673 --> 01:01:18,926
You bugger. I have been greasing
those peacocks all night, and you...

784
01:01:19,969 --> 01:01:21,763
Oh, my goodness gracious.

785
01:01:22,638 --> 01:01:23,765
That's a work of art.

786
01:01:23,931 --> 01:01:25,558
Sameer, Diana. Diana, Sameer.

787
01:01:25,725 --> 01:01:27,894
Hi, Diana.
You can call me Sammy, please.

788
01:01:28,061 --> 01:01:29,062
"Sammy."

789
01:01:29,228 --> 01:01:31,439
Sameer, I wouldn't do that,
if I were you.

790
01:01:31,606 --> 01:01:32,940
Sameer's a top undercover man.

791
01:01:33,107 --> 01:01:35,587
<i>He can talk the skin off a cat
in as many languages as you can.</i>

792
01:01:54,295 --> 01:01:55,380
Oh, you're done.

793
01:01:55,546 --> 01:01:56,547
Where's Charlie?

794
01:02:00,468 --> 01:02:01,552
<i>Le voilà.</i>

795
01:02:04,722 --> 01:02:07,016
At least this "Charlie"
is good with his fists.

796
01:02:07,975 --> 01:02:09,185
That's not Charlie.

797
01:02:17,110 --> 01:02:18,152
That's Charlie.

798
01:02:22,490 --> 01:02:23,491
Steven!

799
01:02:23,950 --> 01:02:26,494
May God put a flower
upon your head, son.

800
01:02:26,661 --> 01:02:27,954
Good to see you.

801
01:02:29,455 --> 01:02:31,499
<i>So, what were you fighting about?</i>

802
01:02:32,458 --> 01:02:35,378
I mistook his glass for mine.
It happens.

803
01:02:35,545 --> 01:02:37,130
This man is no fighter.

804
01:02:37,296 --> 01:02:39,173
Charlie is an expert marksman.

805
01:02:39,674 --> 01:02:40,714
It means he shoots people.

806
01:02:40,842 --> 01:02:42,510
From very far away.

807
01:02:42,844 --> 01:02:44,303
They never know what hit them.

808
01:02:45,972 --> 01:02:48,558
So, how do you know who you kill
if you can't see their face?

809
01:02:48,724 --> 01:02:50,893
I don't. Trust me, it's better that way.

810
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:52,437
You fight without honor.

811
01:02:53,020 --> 01:02:54,647
Who gets paid for honor? Eh?

812
01:02:55,982 --> 01:02:57,358
So, what's the job, boss?

813
01:02:58,860 --> 01:02:59,986
Uh, two days, tops.

814
01:03:00,153 --> 01:03:02,572
We need, uh, supplies
and passage to Belgium.

815
01:03:02,738 --> 01:03:03,823
And what's the going rate?

816
01:03:03,990 --> 01:03:05,032
Better be a good pay.

817
01:03:05,199 --> 01:03:07,326
Yeah, well, here's the thing.

818
01:03:08,161 --> 01:03:10,329
Um, I told you it was going to be quick.

819
01:03:11,789 --> 01:03:14,333
And there's a lot to be gained by this.

820
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:16,377
So, it's for a great cause...

821
01:03:16,794 --> 01:03:17,795
Uh, freedom...

822
01:03:18,004 --> 01:03:19,005
Hmm.

823
01:03:19,213 --> 01:03:20,590
Friendship,

824
01:03:23,176 --> 01:03:24,319
uh, ending the war, friendship...

825
01:03:24,343 --> 01:03:25,678
- Okay, you have no money.
- No.

826
01:03:33,352 --> 01:03:34,604
What?

827
01:03:34,770 --> 01:03:35,897
What is this?

828
01:03:36,063 --> 01:03:37,663
We're going to drop her off
at the front.

829
01:03:37,690 --> 01:03:39,317
- "Dropping her off"?
- Yeah.

830
01:03:39,942 --> 01:03:42,195
Listen, sweetheart,
I'm not going to get myself killed

831
01:03:42,361 --> 01:03:43,672
helping a wee lassie out of a ditch.

832
01:03:43,696 --> 01:03:45,740
- Know what I mean?
- Here's the little thief now!

833
01:03:45,907 --> 01:03:47,909
We don't need your kind around here.

834
01:03:58,085 --> 01:03:59,337
She did it!

835
01:03:59,921 --> 01:04:02,798
I'm both frightened and aroused.

836
01:04:09,096 --> 01:04:10,866
- Oh, here they are! Sorry I'm late.
- Sir Patrick!

837
01:04:10,890 --> 01:04:12,490
Yes, that's what I was going to mention.

838
01:04:14,268 --> 01:04:16,062
- Sir Patrick.
<i>- Oh, no, no, no.</i>

839
01:04:16,229 --> 01:04:18,397
Please, gentlemen, sit.
Miss Prince, sit.

840
01:04:22,610 --> 01:04:24,820
I assume you're here
planning something

841
01:04:24,987 --> 01:04:28,157
that's going to get you either
court-martialed or killed.

842
01:04:28,324 --> 01:04:30,201
And I assume you're here to stop us.

843
01:04:30,826 --> 01:04:31,953
No.

844
01:04:32,119 --> 01:04:33,788
Not at all, in fact.

845
01:04:34,789 --> 01:04:35,790
Well, look.

846
01:04:35,957 --> 01:04:37,250
I was a younger man, once.

847
01:04:37,416 --> 01:04:40,456
And, had I been in better health, I'd like
to think that I might do the same.

848
01:04:40,628 --> 01:04:41,629
Hmm.

849
01:04:41,837 --> 01:04:44,090
<i>It's a very,
very honorable thing you're doing.</i>

850
01:04:44,257 --> 01:04:45,258
Therefore,

851
01:04:46,467 --> 01:04:47,802
I'm here to help.

852
01:04:48,469 --> 01:04:49,845
Unofficially, of course.

853
01:04:50,972 --> 01:04:52,181
What's your plan?

854
01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:56,644
If there's another weapons facility,
find it and destroy it.

855
01:04:57,144 --> 01:04:59,105
Along with Ludendorff and Maru.

856
01:05:00,356 --> 01:05:03,109
In that case, to allay suspicion,

857
01:05:03,776 --> 01:05:07,905
the charming Etta, here,
could, uh, run the mission from my office.

858
01:05:08,489 --> 01:05:09,490
"Run"...

859
01:05:11,701 --> 01:05:12,702
Also,

860
01:05:13,661 --> 01:05:16,163
there's enough here for a few days.

861
01:05:21,669 --> 01:05:22,712
Thank you, sir.

862
01:05:22,878 --> 01:05:24,463
You're very welcome.

863
01:05:25,006 --> 01:05:27,049
Take great care, all of you,

864
01:05:27,216 --> 01:05:28,217
<i>and good luck.</i>

865
01:05:39,562 --> 01:05:40,563
Cheers!

866
01:05:49,614 --> 01:05:51,532
Fresh ice cream, made today. Hello, miss.

867
01:05:51,699 --> 01:05:53,099
Would you like to buy an ice cream?

868
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:54,785
- Me?
- Are you hungry?

869
01:05:54,952 --> 01:05:55,953
Yes.

870
01:05:56,162 --> 01:05:57,371
Thank you.

871
01:05:57,538 --> 01:05:58,581
Eight pence, please, sir.

872
01:05:58,748 --> 01:06:00,108
Here you go, pal. Keep the change.

873
01:06:00,207 --> 01:06:02,376
- Thank you very much, sir.
- Mmm.

874
01:06:02,585 --> 01:06:04,065
- What do you think?
- It's wonderful!

875
01:06:04,211 --> 01:06:05,212
Yeah.

876
01:06:06,380 --> 01:06:08,841
- You should be very proud.
<i>- Thank you very much!</i>

877
01:06:09,008 --> 01:06:10,384
You should be very proud.

878
01:06:13,721 --> 01:06:17,058
<i>It's a long way to Tipperary</i>

879
01:06:17,224 --> 01:06:20,603
<i>It's a long way to go</i>

880
01:06:20,770 --> 01:06:24,023
I hope our guy meets us here.
Chief's expecting us before dark.

881
01:06:24,732 --> 01:06:25,775
"Chief"?

882
01:06:26,776 --> 01:06:28,402
Uh, yeah. A smuggler.

883
01:06:29,236 --> 01:06:30,696
Very reputable.

884
01:06:31,072 --> 01:06:34,200
A liar, a murderer, and now a smuggler.

885
01:06:34,742 --> 01:06:35,743
Lovely.

886
01:06:36,243 --> 01:06:37,536
Careful, I might get offended.

887
01:06:37,703 --> 01:06:39,246
I wasn't referring to you.

888
01:06:39,705 --> 01:06:40,706
Really?

889
01:06:40,956 --> 01:06:42,996
I went undercover
and pretended to be somebody else,

890
01:06:43,084 --> 01:06:44,895
shot people on your beach,
and smuggled a notebook.

891
01:06:44,919 --> 01:06:47,421
Liar, murderer, smuggler.
Are you still coming?

892
01:07:07,066 --> 01:07:08,067
It's awful.

893
01:07:09,443 --> 01:07:10,945
That's why we're here.

894
01:07:29,004 --> 01:07:30,798
The gas will kill everything.

895
01:07:30,965 --> 01:07:33,676
What kind of weapon kills innocents?

896
01:07:34,135 --> 01:07:35,678
In this war,

897
01:07:35,845 --> 01:07:37,179
every kind.

898
01:07:42,685 --> 01:07:45,187
You were absent
at the council meeting, General.

899
01:07:45,354 --> 01:07:48,065
I see you are negotiating the terms
of the armistice without me.

900
01:07:48,232 --> 01:07:50,985
- On the <i>Kaiser's</i> behalf.
- And on your insistence!

901
01:07:51,527 --> 01:07:54,613
We could easily win this war,
if only you had a little faith.

902
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:56,073
<i>We don't.</i>

903
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:57,908
<i>There are shortages of food,</i>

904
01:07:58,075 --> 01:07:59,869
medicine, ammunition.

905
01:08:00,995 --> 01:08:04,749
Every hour we delay
costs thousands of German lives.

906
01:08:04,915 --> 01:08:07,585
One attack and the war can be ours!

907
01:08:10,254 --> 01:08:12,089
As we speak, my chemist...

908
01:08:12,256 --> 01:08:14,467
We stand against you and your

909
01:08:14,759 --> 01:08:15,760
witch.

910
01:08:16,218 --> 01:08:18,095
Ludendorff, enough!

911
01:08:19,472 --> 01:08:21,432
Twenty-four hours from now,

912
01:08:21,599 --> 01:08:23,684
this war will end.

913
01:08:24,268 --> 01:08:25,770
It is over.

914
01:08:26,979 --> 01:08:28,564
It is over for you.

915
01:08:32,193 --> 01:08:33,736
It is over for all of you.

916
01:08:50,628 --> 01:08:51,962
But the mask won't help.

917
01:08:52,129 --> 01:08:54,006
They don't know that.

918
01:09:08,979 --> 01:09:09,980
Let's go!

919
01:09:10,147 --> 01:09:12,441
Time to stage a demonstration
for the <i>Kaiser!</i>

920
01:09:14,902 --> 01:09:15,945
You're late.

921
01:09:16,111 --> 01:09:17,488
<i>Cowboy sneak-attack, Chief!</i>

922
01:09:18,489 --> 01:09:19,490
How are you?

923
01:09:20,324 --> 01:09:21,884
- Good to see you, pal.
<i>- Okay, big man!</i>

924
01:09:24,662 --> 01:09:26,497
- Good to see you.
- Ah, yes!

925
01:09:27,248 --> 01:09:28,749
Good to see you, my friend.

926
01:09:29,667 --> 01:09:30,918
You beauty!

927
01:09:31,669 --> 01:09:33,045
Who is this?

928
01:09:39,844 --> 01:09:41,470
And I am Diana.

929
01:09:42,346 --> 01:09:43,389
Where did you find her?

930
01:09:43,931 --> 01:09:45,099
She found me.

931
01:09:45,683 --> 01:09:47,977
- I plucked him from the sea.
<i>- It's a long story.</i>

932
01:09:48,143 --> 01:09:49,371
We don't have to
talk about that right now.

933
01:09:49,395 --> 01:09:50,813
What's there?

934
01:09:51,981 --> 01:09:53,983
British tea for the Germans,

935
01:09:54,149 --> 01:09:56,110
German beer for the British.

936
01:09:57,820 --> 01:10:00,197
And Edgar Rice Burroughs novels
for both.

937
01:10:00,364 --> 01:10:01,407
And guns!

938
01:10:03,367 --> 01:10:06,287
Well, may we get what we want!

939
01:10:06,453 --> 01:10:07,788
May we get what we need.

940
01:10:07,955 --> 01:10:10,207
But may we never get what we deserve.

941
01:10:10,374 --> 01:10:11,750
Bang!

942
01:10:18,674 --> 01:10:20,009
Strange thunder.

943
01:10:21,552 --> 01:10:23,053
German 77s.

944
01:10:23,387 --> 01:10:24,722
Guns. Big ones.

945
01:10:25,973 --> 01:10:27,308
It's the front, out there.

946
01:10:28,642 --> 01:10:30,019
The evening hate.

947
01:10:30,728 --> 01:10:32,646
So, who do you fight for in this war?

948
01:10:32,813 --> 01:10:33,981
I don't fight.

949
01:10:34,148 --> 01:10:36,150
<i>You're here for profit, then?</i>

950
01:10:36,525 --> 01:10:38,527
No better place to be.

951
01:10:39,862 --> 01:10:42,132
Nowhere better to be than in a war
where you don't take a side?

952
01:10:42,156 --> 01:10:43,324
<i>I have nowhere else.</i>

953
01:10:43,866 --> 01:10:45,468
The last war
took everything from my people.

954
01:10:45,492 --> 01:10:46,785
We have nothing left.

955
01:10:47,661 --> 01:10:48,871
At least here,

956
01:10:49,663 --> 01:10:51,081
I'm free.

957
01:10:51,665 --> 01:10:53,542
Who took that from your people?

958
01:10:54,168 --> 01:10:55,502
His people.

959
01:11:00,549 --> 01:11:01,550
<i>Don't go...</i>

960
01:11:02,259 --> 01:11:04,887
Don't go in. Don't go!

961
01:11:05,054 --> 01:11:07,348
<i>Don't! Boys, no!</i>

962
01:11:07,514 --> 01:11:08,515
Don't go in there!

963
01:11:08,682 --> 01:11:10,142
Shh. You're safe.

964
01:11:10,309 --> 01:11:12,478
You're safe. Are you okay?

965
01:11:12,645 --> 01:11:13,979
Get off me, woman!

966
01:11:14,146 --> 01:11:15,689
Stop making a fuss!

967
01:11:16,023 --> 01:11:17,191
God!

968
01:11:21,278 --> 01:11:23,656
He sees ghosts.

969
01:11:28,661 --> 01:11:29,745
You're going to get cold.

970
01:11:29,912 --> 01:11:31,038
Oh, I don't...

971
01:11:31,497 --> 01:11:33,874
Don't worry about Charlie.
He doesn't mean anything by it.

972
01:11:49,306 --> 01:11:51,475
<i>Get out of there, now.
We've got to move!</i>

973
01:11:51,642 --> 01:11:54,061
You bloody animal, move!
Go on! Get on!

974
01:11:54,228 --> 01:11:56,188
These animals,
why are they hurting them?

975
01:11:56,355 --> 01:11:58,357
Because they need to move, quick!

976
01:11:58,524 --> 01:12:00,192
- Like us!
- But this is not the way.

977
01:12:00,901 --> 01:12:02,444
I could help them.

978
01:12:02,653 --> 01:12:03,933
<i>There's no time. Come on, woman!</i>

979
01:12:07,074 --> 01:12:08,200
Mama!

980
01:12:12,997 --> 01:12:14,915
That man... He's wounded.

981
01:12:15,082 --> 01:12:17,126
<i>There is nothing you can do
about it, Diana.</i>

982
01:12:17,292 --> 01:12:18,836
<i>We must keep moving!</i>

983
01:12:39,857 --> 01:12:41,108
What is this?

984
01:12:41,275 --> 01:12:43,318
You wanted me to take you to the war.
This is it.

985
01:12:43,485 --> 01:12:44,862
So, where are the Germans?

986
01:12:45,029 --> 01:12:47,448
A couple hundred yards
across the field.

987
01:12:47,614 --> 01:12:48,949
- Their trench is...
- Watch out!

988
01:12:51,577 --> 01:12:53,746
Chief! It's good to see you!

989
01:12:53,912 --> 01:12:56,123
<i>Oi! Chief's back! He's back!</i>

990
01:12:57,583 --> 01:12:58,751
All right, let's move!

991
01:13:14,558 --> 01:13:17,144
- Diana, we have to go.
- We need to help these people.

992
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:18,391
We have to stay on-mission.

993
01:13:18,479 --> 01:13:19,956
The next safe crossing
is at least a day away.

994
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:22,542
- What are we waiting for?
- We cannot leave without helping them.

995
01:13:22,566 --> 01:13:24,151
These people are dying.

996
01:13:24,318 --> 01:13:26,129
They have nothing to eat,
and in the village...

997
01:13:26,153 --> 01:13:27,714
- Enslaved, she said!
- I understand that.

998
01:13:27,738 --> 01:13:28,739
Women and children!

999
01:13:28,906 --> 01:13:30,258
We need to make
our next position by sundown.

1000
01:13:30,282 --> 01:13:32,451
How can you say that?
What is the matter with you?

1001
01:13:32,618 --> 01:13:34,661
This is No Man's Land, Diana!

1002
01:13:35,245 --> 01:13:37,122
It means no man can cross it,
all right?

1003
01:13:37,289 --> 01:13:39,625
This battalion has been here
for nearly a year

1004
01:13:39,792 --> 01:13:42,169
and they barely gained an inch.

1005
01:13:42,336 --> 01:13:45,631
Because, on the other side,
there are a bunch of Germans

1006
01:13:45,798 --> 01:13:48,038
pointing machine guns at
every square inch of this place.

1007
01:13:48,133 --> 01:13:50,385
This is not something you can cross.
It's not possible.

1008
01:13:50,552 --> 01:13:51,929
So what? So, we do nothing?

1009
01:13:52,096 --> 01:13:53,847
No, we are doing something.
We are.

1010
01:13:54,014 --> 01:13:55,307
- We just...
- Steve.

1011
01:13:55,474 --> 01:13:56,892
We can't save everyone in this war.

1012
01:13:57,059 --> 01:13:58,268
<i>Steve, Steve...</i>

1013
01:13:58,977 --> 01:14:00,417
This is not what we came here to do.

1014
01:14:16,495 --> 01:14:17,496
No,

1015
01:14:17,663 --> 01:14:19,665
but it's what I'm going to do.

1016
01:14:34,888 --> 01:14:36,223
Diana!

1017
01:14:58,412 --> 01:15:00,706
What the bloody hell
is she playing at?

1018
01:15:17,097 --> 01:15:19,474
She's taking all the fire!
Let's go!

1019
01:15:22,978 --> 01:15:25,063
Stay down! Stay down!

1020
01:15:25,230 --> 01:15:26,607
<i>That's an order!</i>

1021
01:16:19,826 --> 01:16:20,661
Go, now!

1022
01:16:20,827 --> 01:16:22,746
<i>She's done it!
She's got them on the run!</i>

1023
01:16:26,625 --> 01:16:28,835
Get down, get down! She's done it!

1024
01:16:42,557 --> 01:16:43,976
Steve!

1025
01:16:44,184 --> 01:16:45,269
Let's go!

1026
01:16:48,063 --> 01:16:49,773
Come on, go!

1027
01:17:10,043 --> 01:17:11,628
Stay here. I'll go ahead.

1028
01:17:47,247 --> 01:17:48,623
- What the...
- Let's move!

1029
01:18:26,953 --> 01:18:28,455
<i>We need more firepower.</i>

1030
01:19:44,573 --> 01:19:45,657
Sniper!

1031
01:19:45,824 --> 01:19:47,117
Go!

1032
01:19:49,327 --> 01:19:50,328
Get in!

1033
01:19:50,495 --> 01:19:51,955
Charlie, bell tower!

1034
01:20:00,172 --> 01:20:01,292
<i>Come on, Charlie. Shoot him!</i>

1035
01:20:02,424 --> 01:20:04,384
Hey, it's okay.

1036
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:07,721
<i>Huh.</i>

1037
01:20:09,514 --> 01:20:11,516
Follow me! Give me some cover!

1038
01:20:17,689 --> 01:20:19,399
Right!

1039
01:20:19,566 --> 01:20:22,277
We're going to put this on our backs,
and, when I say go,

1040
01:20:22,444 --> 01:20:23,444
- lift hard!
- Okay.

1041
01:20:24,446 --> 01:20:26,323
<i>Diana! Shield!</i>

1042
01:20:30,410 --> 01:20:31,912
Go!

1043
01:21:33,598 --> 01:21:35,642
<i>Stay very,
very still for me, my friends.</i>

1044
01:21:35,809 --> 01:21:37,435
<i>Please. So important.</i>

1045
01:21:41,147 --> 01:21:42,440
Thank you very much.

1046
01:21:42,607 --> 01:21:45,318
This has been such an honor for me,
taking your photograph.

1047
01:21:45,485 --> 01:21:46,528
Thank you so much.

1048
01:21:52,951 --> 01:21:55,245
<i>For all his talk of shooting,</i>

1049
01:21:55,412 --> 01:21:56,997
he cannot shoot.

1050
01:22:00,083 --> 01:22:02,627
Not everyone gets to be
what they want to be all the time.

1051
01:22:03,169 --> 01:22:05,589
Me, I am an actor.

1052
01:22:05,755 --> 01:22:07,132
I love acting.

1053
01:22:07,299 --> 01:22:09,009
I didn't want to be a soldier.

1054
01:22:10,176 --> 01:22:11,636
But I'm the wrong color.

1055
01:22:12,596 --> 01:22:14,931
Everyone is fighting their own battles,
Diana.

1056
01:22:16,349 --> 01:22:17,809
Just as you are fighting yours.

1057
01:22:24,024 --> 01:22:25,650
It's too much.
I wish you well.

1058
01:22:25,817 --> 01:22:26,818
Thank you, thank you.

1059
01:22:30,989 --> 01:22:32,532
I'm on the... On the phone...

1060
01:22:33,033 --> 01:22:35,535
Uh, it's "Veld." V-E-L-D.

1061
01:22:35,702 --> 01:22:37,245
It's a tiny village.

1062
01:22:37,412 --> 01:22:39,205
<i>It may not even be on the map.</i>

1063
01:22:39,372 --> 01:22:40,707
Ooh! I found it! I found it!

1064
01:22:41,249 --> 01:22:42,834
<i>Did you find Ludendorff's operation?</i>

1065
01:22:43,001 --> 01:22:44,836
No, no, no. But I located him.

1066
01:22:45,003 --> 01:22:47,464
And, oh, lucky you,
he's only a few miles away,

1067
01:22:47,631 --> 01:22:49,466
at German High Command.

1068
01:22:49,883 --> 01:22:51,551
<i>German High Command, huh?</i>

1069
01:22:51,718 --> 01:22:53,345
So, intel reports

1070
01:22:53,511 --> 01:22:55,680
<i>that Ludendorff is hosting a gala.</i>

1071
01:22:55,847 --> 01:22:57,223
<i>A sort of "last hurrah"</i>

1072
01:22:57,390 --> 01:22:59,684
before the Germans sign the armistice.

1073
01:22:59,851 --> 01:23:02,562
And the <i>Kaiser</i> himself
is going to be there.

1074
01:23:03,063 --> 01:23:05,607
As well as Dr. Maru.

1075
01:23:06,232 --> 01:23:07,835
Actually, the gala could be
perfect cover.

1076
01:23:07,859 --> 01:23:09,569
<i>- Captain Trevor.</i>
- Yes, sir.

1077
01:23:09,736 --> 01:23:12,322
<i>You are, under no circumstances,
to go anywhere near</i>

1078
01:23:12,489 --> 01:23:14,532
that gala tomorrow night.
Do you hear me?

1079
01:23:14,699 --> 01:23:16,701
<i>You'd be jeopardizing
everything we've worked for.</i>

1080
01:23:16,868 --> 01:23:19,204
<i>You cannot compromise the armistice.</i>

1081
01:23:19,371 --> 01:23:21,131
- Sir, there will be no armistice...
- Steve!

1082
01:23:21,164 --> 01:23:23,004
...once Ludendorff bombs
the entire front line.

1083
01:23:23,166 --> 01:23:24,167
Hold on one second, sir.

1084
01:23:24,334 --> 01:23:26,354
You shouldn't be bothered
about upsetting the peace accord.

1085
01:23:26,378 --> 01:23:28,213
- Why not?
- Ares would never let...

1086
01:23:28,672 --> 01:23:29,673
What?

1087
01:23:30,215 --> 01:23:31,216
What is it?

1088
01:23:31,758 --> 01:23:33,718
Of course. It makes complete sense.

1089
01:23:35,220 --> 01:23:38,306
Ares developed a weapon,
the worst ever devised.

1090
01:23:38,473 --> 01:23:40,225
- Ares? You mean Ludendorff.
- No.

1091
01:23:40,767 --> 01:23:42,185
I mean Ares.

1092
01:23:42,769 --> 01:23:44,187
Ludendorff is Ares!

1093
01:23:45,814 --> 01:23:47,565
Sir, this is our last chance,

1094
01:23:47,732 --> 01:23:49,492
our final chance
to find out where the gas is

1095
01:23:49,651 --> 01:23:51,587
and to learn how Ludendorff
plans on delivering it.

1096
01:23:51,611 --> 01:23:53,363
No, no, no. I forbid it.

1097
01:23:53,530 --> 01:23:54,739
Do you hear me? I forbid it.

1098
01:23:54,906 --> 01:23:56,783
Sir, I'm losing you! Sir?

1099
01:23:56,950 --> 01:23:57,951
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Sir...

1100
01:24:01,246 --> 01:24:02,956
How likely is he to respect my wishes?

1101
01:24:03,123 --> 01:24:05,291
Not very likely, I'll be honest.

1102
01:24:11,589 --> 01:24:13,258
Sammy. Sammy, no. No, no, no.

1103
01:24:13,425 --> 01:24:15,301
Sammy, I have to work.

1104
01:24:15,468 --> 01:24:16,779
I gotta rustle up a German uniform.

1105
01:24:16,803 --> 01:24:18,239
I still have to plot the course
for tomorrow.

1106
01:24:18,263 --> 01:24:19,889
That's easy, boss. Come on.

1107
01:24:20,056 --> 01:24:21,575
There is nothing we can do
until tomorrow.

1108
01:24:21,599 --> 01:24:22,719
You said it yourself, Steve.

1109
01:24:22,809 --> 01:24:24,811
So... <i>Madame, s'il vous plaît.</i>

1110
01:24:24,978 --> 01:24:25,979
<i>Incroyable!</i>

1111
01:24:26,730 --> 01:24:28,231
<i>Magnifique!</i>

1112
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:29,441
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1113
01:24:29,607 --> 01:24:30,817
<i>Monsieur, s'il vous plaît.</i>

1114
01:24:32,944 --> 01:24:34,362
<i>- Et voilà!</i>
- Merci, <i>Sammy.</i>

1115
01:24:34,529 --> 01:24:35,530
<i>Et voilà!</i>

1116
01:24:47,876 --> 01:24:49,169
You did this.

1117
01:24:51,463 --> 01:24:52,464
We did.

1118
01:24:57,427 --> 01:24:58,845
Do you have dancing on

1119
01:24:59,721 --> 01:25:01,014
Paradise Island?

1120
01:25:01,181 --> 01:25:02,974
Dancing, yeah. Of course.

1121
01:25:03,141 --> 01:25:07,187
But these people are just swaying.

1122
01:25:08,021 --> 01:25:11,399
Okay, if you're going to be fighting
the God of War,

1123
01:25:11,566 --> 01:25:14,527
I may as well teach you how to dance,
you poor thing.

1124
01:25:14,694 --> 01:25:17,363
All right, probably without the gun.

1125
01:25:17,530 --> 01:25:18,782
<i>Madame.</i>

1126
01:25:21,534 --> 01:25:23,077
If you would.

1127
01:25:23,745 --> 01:25:24,746
Well...

1128
01:25:26,498 --> 01:25:28,708
If I'm going to a gala,
I'll need to know how to dance.

1129
01:25:28,875 --> 01:25:30,728
- You're not going to the gala.
- Of course I am.

1130
01:25:30,752 --> 01:25:32,629
- No, you're not.
- Why wouldn't I?

1131
01:25:32,796 --> 01:25:34,798
Well, for one,
you don't know how to dance.

1132
01:25:35,340 --> 01:25:37,717
I would argue that
they don't know how to dance.

1133
01:25:37,884 --> 01:25:39,177
Be polite, be polite.

1134
01:25:41,888 --> 01:25:44,307
All right. So, give me your hand.

1135
01:25:44,474 --> 01:25:45,517
Like so.

1136
01:25:46,226 --> 01:25:49,437
And I'm gonna put my arm

1137
01:25:49,604 --> 01:25:51,356
around you, like so.

1138
01:25:52,023 --> 01:25:53,983
And we just...

1139
01:25:54,150 --> 01:25:55,610
What did you call it? "Sway"?

1140
01:25:55,777 --> 01:25:56,903
Then you just sway.

1141
01:25:57,487 --> 01:25:58,988
You're awfully close.

1142
01:26:01,115 --> 01:26:03,243
That's what it's all about.

1143
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:07,330
I see.

1144
01:26:16,297 --> 01:26:18,550
I haven't heard him sing in years.

1145
01:26:35,066 --> 01:26:37,902
It's, uh... It's a snowfall.

1146
01:26:42,282 --> 01:26:43,283
Touch it.

1147
01:26:46,411 --> 01:26:47,912
It's magical!

1148
01:26:48,913 --> 01:26:50,623
It is, isn't it?

1149
01:26:52,667 --> 01:26:54,085
It is, yeah.

1150
01:27:00,633 --> 01:27:04,053
Is this what people do
when there are no wars to fight?

1151
01:27:04,762 --> 01:27:05,763
Yeah.

1152
01:27:07,056 --> 01:27:10,143
Yeah, this and other things.

1153
01:27:10,310 --> 01:27:11,728
What things?

1154
01:27:13,646 --> 01:27:14,647
Um...

1155
01:27:19,152 --> 01:27:20,653
They have breakfast.

1156
01:27:21,237 --> 01:27:22,864
They really love a breakfast.

1157
01:27:23,031 --> 01:27:25,575
And, um, they love to wake up

1158
01:27:26,534 --> 01:27:28,745
and read the paper and go to work.

1159
01:27:29,829 --> 01:27:31,581
They get married.

1160
01:27:32,206 --> 01:27:33,958
Make some babies,
grow old together.

1161
01:27:34,709 --> 01:27:35,793
I guess.

1162
01:27:39,756 --> 01:27:41,257
What is it like?

1163
01:27:45,261 --> 01:27:46,763
I have no idea.

1164
01:29:21,733 --> 01:29:23,151
The villagers gave them to us.

1165
01:29:24,068 --> 01:29:26,779
- A gracious gift.
- And they call us heroes.

1166
01:29:26,946 --> 01:29:27,947
You are.

1167
01:29:28,740 --> 01:29:30,533
Hey, fellas. I know that

1168
01:29:31,784 --> 01:29:33,453
I said this job was two days,

1169
01:29:35,663 --> 01:29:36,748
and a deal's a deal.

1170
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:40,501
You'd get lost without us.

1171
01:29:41,419 --> 01:29:42,420
Yeah.

1172
01:29:43,212 --> 01:29:45,372
<i>We all know Diana is capable
of taking care of herself.</i>

1173
01:29:45,590 --> 01:29:47,175
I'm worried that you won't make it.

1174
01:29:47,341 --> 01:29:48,634
There's no more money.

1175
01:29:48,801 --> 01:29:50,219
We've been paid enough.

1176
01:29:50,803 --> 01:29:52,722
Maybe you're better off
without me, yeah?

1177
01:29:53,723 --> 01:29:55,308
No, Charlie.

1178
01:29:56,768 --> 01:29:58,853
Who will sing for us?

1179
01:29:59,645 --> 01:30:01,773
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Oh, no, please.

1180
01:30:02,648 --> 01:30:03,900
Sing?

1181
01:30:04,108 --> 01:30:05,818
You asked for it.

1182
01:30:05,985 --> 01:30:09,113
<i>Green grow the rashes, O</i>

1183
01:30:09,405 --> 01:30:12,992
<i>Green grow the rashes, O</i>

1184
01:30:13,159 --> 01:30:16,829
<i>The sweetest hours I e'er did spend</i>

1185
01:30:17,830 --> 01:30:19,999
You must think
I was born yesterday.

1186
01:30:20,166 --> 01:30:22,043
I know it sounds crazy,
but it's true.

1187
01:30:22,210 --> 01:30:23,377
Every word.

1188
01:30:23,753 --> 01:30:25,129
Wait, wait, wait.

1189
01:30:25,296 --> 01:30:27,215
There is a whole island
of women like her?

1190
01:30:27,381 --> 01:30:29,175
And not a single man among them?

1191
01:30:30,176 --> 01:30:31,427
How do we get there?

1192
01:30:31,719 --> 01:30:33,679
<i>And she thinks</i>

1193
01:30:33,846 --> 01:30:35,890
that Ludendorff is Ares, the God of War?

1194
01:30:36,057 --> 01:30:38,935
And only by killing him
will the war end? Don't be daft.

1195
01:30:39,102 --> 01:30:40,520
<i>You saw what happened out there.</i>

1196
01:30:41,020 --> 01:30:43,106
<i>The way she charged
that machine-gun nest?</i>

1197
01:30:43,272 --> 01:30:45,066
The way she took out that tower?

1198
01:30:46,567 --> 01:30:47,902
Maybe it's true.

1199
01:30:49,070 --> 01:30:50,404
I think it's true.

1200
01:30:50,863 --> 01:30:51,906
I believe it's true.

1201
01:30:52,073 --> 01:30:53,074
<i>Et voilà.</i>

1202
01:30:53,241 --> 01:30:57,036
Steven, son, you don't really believe
this rubbish, do you?

1203
01:31:20,226 --> 01:31:22,562
Diana! Diana!
Hiding, hiding.

1204
01:31:24,397 --> 01:31:25,815
How the hell do we get into that?

1205
01:31:26,899 --> 01:31:29,652
I see only a couple of guards
on the door to distract.

1206
01:31:29,861 --> 01:31:31,341
Yeah, it won't look suspicious at all

1207
01:31:31,404 --> 01:31:33,048
when I come sauntering
out of the woods on foot.

1208
01:31:33,072 --> 01:31:34,073
I could get in.

1209
01:31:34,240 --> 01:31:35,840
You're not going in. It's too dangerous.

1210
01:31:35,908 --> 01:31:37,493
- Too dangerous?
- Yes, too dangerous.

1211
01:31:37,660 --> 01:31:38,744
And you're too distracting.

1212
01:31:38,911 --> 01:31:41,372
So, look, I'll go in there,
and follow them

1213
01:31:41,539 --> 01:31:44,143
to wherever they're working on the gas
or, better yet, where it is.

1214
01:31:44,167 --> 01:31:45,561
- Then I'm coming with you.
<i>- No, you're not!</i>

1215
01:31:45,585 --> 01:31:48,421
What you're wearing
isn't exactly undercover.

1216
01:31:48,588 --> 01:31:49,589
I don't know.

1217
01:31:49,755 --> 01:31:51,733
I would say she was pretty undercover
on that battlefield.

1218
01:31:51,757 --> 01:31:53,801
<i>We just...
We can't get you in, okay?</i>

1219
01:31:53,968 --> 01:31:55,529
So, I'll scout it out, report back, and...

1220
01:31:55,553 --> 01:31:57,430
But as long as he's still alive,
it doesn't...

1221
01:31:57,597 --> 01:32:00,057
You cannot go into German High Command
and kill anyone.

1222
01:32:00,224 --> 01:32:02,101
You just can't. You have to trust me.

1223
01:32:03,436 --> 01:32:05,271
- Oh, wow!
- Where did that come from?

1224
01:32:05,438 --> 01:32:07,481
Oh, can I drive it?
Please, let me drive it!

1225
01:32:07,648 --> 01:32:08,900
I'll be your chauffeur.

1226
01:32:09,066 --> 01:32:10,276
Come on, come on.

1227
01:32:11,027 --> 01:32:12,028
Stay put!

1228
01:32:12,862 --> 01:32:13,863
<i>Where did this come from?</i>

1229
01:32:14,030 --> 01:32:16,199
A field over there. It's full of them!

1230
01:32:20,786 --> 01:32:22,014
Chief, I say you and me
scope out the area

1231
01:32:22,038 --> 01:32:23,598
in case we need to
beat a hasty retreat.

1232
01:32:23,748 --> 01:32:26,125
- What do you say, Diana?
- Huh?

1233
01:32:30,630 --> 01:32:31,839
<i>Colonel.</i>

1234
01:32:35,801 --> 01:32:38,387
Steve, they have invitations.

1235
01:32:39,805 --> 01:32:42,183
Don't worry, play it cool.
You got this. You got this.

1236
01:32:46,479 --> 01:32:47,521
Your invitation, please.

1237
01:32:47,688 --> 01:32:48,689
<i>Dhanyavaad,</i> sahib.

1238
01:32:48,898 --> 01:32:50,498
The colonel and I
wish for many blessings

1239
01:32:50,650 --> 01:32:52,770
and all manner of other things
to fall upon your head.

1240
01:32:52,902 --> 01:32:54,445
Your head must be empty.

1241
01:32:54,654 --> 01:32:56,530
He wants my invitation, you idiot.

1242
01:32:56,697 --> 01:32:57,865
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1243
01:32:58,032 --> 01:33:00,493
I must apologize
a thousand, thousand times, my master.

1244
01:33:00,701 --> 01:33:03,663
I make the most horrible,
the most unforgivable mistake.

1245
01:33:03,829 --> 01:33:05,098
I lost the colonel's invitation.

1246
01:33:05,122 --> 01:33:06,123
What?

1247
01:33:06,290 --> 01:33:09,001
Are you saying we drove all the way
through the mud and rain

1248
01:33:09,168 --> 01:33:10,896
- only for you to lose my invitation?
- I'm a snail.

1249
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:12,004
No! I'm a bug.

1250
01:33:12,171 --> 01:33:14,048
Not even a bug.
I am the dung of a bug!

1251
01:33:14,215 --> 01:33:15,466
And you're right, master...

1252
01:33:16,175 --> 01:33:17,510
Blessing be upon us.

1253
01:33:28,229 --> 01:33:29,605
<i>This is ridiculous.</i>

1254
01:33:29,772 --> 01:33:31,941
<i>I'm not going to spend
the entire evening out here,</i>

1255
01:33:32,108 --> 01:33:34,193
you stupid idiots! Move your cars!

1256
01:33:55,423 --> 01:33:56,924
What are you supposed to be?

1257
01:34:00,594 --> 01:34:02,221
What are you doing?

1258
01:34:27,038 --> 01:34:28,080
Excuse me.

1259
01:34:30,916 --> 01:34:32,251
I don't drink.

1260
01:34:40,426 --> 01:34:41,594
Have we met?

1261
01:34:41,761 --> 01:34:43,596
No, but I've been watching you.

1262
01:34:44,597 --> 01:34:46,057
Following your career, I mean.

1263
01:34:47,433 --> 01:34:49,935
<i>You are Dr. Isabel Maru.</i>

1264
01:34:50,102 --> 01:34:52,646
The most talented chemist
in the German Army.

1265
01:34:52,813 --> 01:34:54,440
I am a fan.

1266
01:35:05,326 --> 01:35:07,453
I hope I am not crossing a line.

1267
01:35:08,954 --> 01:35:11,374
I know you
and General Ludendorff are

1268
01:35:11,540 --> 01:35:12,583
very close.

1269
01:35:12,750 --> 01:35:16,003
We work well together. Yes.

1270
01:35:16,837 --> 01:35:19,799
But having someone like me behind you,

1271
01:35:20,466 --> 01:35:22,093
I could provide a lot more.

1272
01:35:22,259 --> 01:35:24,136
And who are you?

1273
01:35:24,720 --> 01:35:28,682
A man who would show you appreciation
a genius like yourself deserves.

1274
01:35:35,147 --> 01:35:37,650
I love fire. Don't you?

1275
01:35:40,152 --> 01:35:41,821
It is like

1276
01:35:43,155 --> 01:35:45,282
a living act of entropy.

1277
01:35:45,449 --> 01:35:47,827
The ultimate weapon of destruction.

1278
01:35:48,744 --> 01:35:50,955
Reminding us that, in the end,

1279
01:35:51,455 --> 01:35:54,834
everything eventually
returns to the ash it came from.

1280
01:35:57,336 --> 01:35:59,797
There is something reassuring about it.

1281
01:36:05,094 --> 01:36:07,304
I see all of that in your eyes.

1282
01:36:10,766 --> 01:36:13,060
Perhaps you could show me
what you're working on.

1283
01:36:29,118 --> 01:36:30,619
<i>I hear it is...</i>

1284
01:36:32,872 --> 01:36:35,124
I hear it is extraordinary.

1285
01:36:35,916 --> 01:36:39,587
I appreciate your interest in my work,

1286
01:36:39,753 --> 01:36:42,047
<i>but I am loyal to General Ludendorff.</i>

1287
01:36:42,214 --> 01:36:43,215
<i>Besides,</i>

1288
01:36:43,757 --> 01:36:46,469
now I see your attention is

1289
01:36:49,638 --> 01:36:50,681
elsewhere.

1290
01:37:14,705 --> 01:37:16,582
Enjoying the party?

1291
01:37:18,584 --> 01:37:21,587
I confess, I'm not sure what it is
we're celebrating.

1292
01:37:21,754 --> 01:37:24,507
A German victory, of course.

1293
01:37:24,673 --> 01:37:25,674
Victory?

1294
01:37:25,841 --> 01:37:28,052
When I hear peace could be so close.

1295
01:37:28,260 --> 01:37:29,261
Peace?

1296
01:37:29,428 --> 01:37:31,555
There's only an armistice

1297
01:37:31,722 --> 01:37:33,724
in an endless war.

1298
01:37:33,891 --> 01:37:35,267
Thucydides.

1299
01:37:35,476 --> 01:37:37,436
Ah! You know your Ancient Greeks.

1300
01:37:37,603 --> 01:37:39,438
They understood

1301
01:37:39,605 --> 01:37:41,941
that war is a god.

1302
01:37:42,107 --> 01:37:43,776
A god that requires human sacrifice.

1303
01:37:43,943 --> 01:37:45,861
And in exchange,

1304
01:37:46,028 --> 01:37:47,780
war gives man purpose,

1305
01:37:48,364 --> 01:37:50,574
meaning, a chance to rise above

1306
01:37:50,741 --> 01:37:53,035
his petty, mortal, little self

1307
01:37:53,619 --> 01:37:54,912
and be courageous,

1308
01:37:55,663 --> 01:37:57,164
noble, better!

1309
01:37:58,165 --> 01:38:01,460
Only one of the many gods
believed in that.

1310
01:38:01,877 --> 01:38:04,046
- Mmm.
- And he was wrong.

1311
01:38:05,256 --> 01:38:07,174
You know nothing of the gods.

1312
01:38:07,341 --> 01:38:08,551
<i>Herr</i> General.

1313
01:38:11,470 --> 01:38:13,013
Enjoy the fireworks.

1314
01:38:18,561 --> 01:38:19,645
What are you doing?

1315
01:38:19,812 --> 01:38:21,252
- Out of my way!
- Diana, look at me.

1316
01:38:21,355 --> 01:38:23,155
If you kill Ludendorff
before we find the gas,

1317
01:38:23,190 --> 01:38:24,543
we won't be able to stop anything.

1318
01:38:24,567 --> 01:38:25,568
I will stop Ares!

1319
01:38:25,734 --> 01:38:26,819
What if you're wrong?

1320
01:38:28,487 --> 01:38:30,155
What if there is no Ares?

1321
01:38:31,949 --> 01:38:33,325
You don't believe me.

1322
01:38:33,867 --> 01:38:35,536
I can't let you do this.

1323
01:38:36,120 --> 01:38:37,413
What I do is not up to you.

1324
01:38:44,211 --> 01:38:45,296
Diana!

1325
01:38:49,717 --> 01:38:50,968
<i>Diana...</i>

1326
01:38:51,135 --> 01:38:52,219
<i>It's the gas.</i>

1327
01:38:52,386 --> 01:38:54,430
The village... The village!

1328
01:38:57,391 --> 01:38:58,976
What are they cheering for?

1329
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:02,688
Diana!

1330
01:39:05,107 --> 01:39:06,734
What did they fire?

1331
01:39:06,900 --> 01:39:07,901
The gas.

1332
01:39:08,068 --> 01:39:09,754
- It was Ludendorff.
- I saw him. He was in the tower.

1333
01:39:09,778 --> 01:39:11,947
Wherever he goes, you follow.

1334
01:39:12,531 --> 01:39:13,782
How will you find us?

1335
01:39:14,366 --> 01:39:15,576
I know how.

1336
01:40:33,362 --> 01:40:34,697
Diana!

1337
01:40:37,825 --> 01:40:40,494
They're dead. They're all dead.

1338
01:40:41,328 --> 01:40:42,955
I could have saved them.

1339
01:40:43,288 --> 01:40:45,666
I could have saved them
if it weren't for you.

1340
01:40:45,833 --> 01:40:47,793
You stopped me from killing Ares!

1341
01:40:48,335 --> 01:40:50,462
- No!
- Stay away from me!

1342
01:40:50,629 --> 01:40:51,964
<i>I understand everything now.</i>

1343
01:40:52,131 --> 01:40:54,091
It isn't just the Germans
that Ares has corrupted.

1344
01:40:54,133 --> 01:40:55,300
It's you, too.

1345
01:40:55,926 --> 01:40:57,052
All of you.

1346
01:40:58,178 --> 01:40:59,555
I will find Ares

1347
01:40:59,722 --> 01:41:01,348
and I will kill him.

1348
01:41:04,476 --> 01:41:05,477
Diana!

1349
01:41:06,770 --> 01:41:08,021
That smoke,

1350
01:41:09,022 --> 01:41:10,149
<i>it's the Chief!</i>

1351
01:41:10,315 --> 01:41:11,567
He followed Ludendorff.

1352
01:41:13,068 --> 01:41:14,653
Follow the smoke!

1353
01:41:40,804 --> 01:41:42,347
Hey! Diana, that way!

1354
01:41:58,739 --> 01:42:00,616
Come on! Let's go!

1355
01:42:22,179 --> 01:42:23,764
<i>What a surprise.</i>

1356
01:42:24,473 --> 01:42:25,682
Strange.

1357
01:42:26,975 --> 01:42:29,144
Unfortunately, I have another matter

1358
01:42:30,437 --> 01:42:31,438
to attend to.

1359
01:42:36,610 --> 01:42:38,904
What are you?

1360
01:42:39,071 --> 01:42:40,322
You will soon find out.

1361
01:43:14,731 --> 01:43:18,443
As magnificent as you are,
you are still no match for me.

1362
01:43:22,614 --> 01:43:24,408
We'll see about that.

1363
01:43:48,682 --> 01:43:50,809
I am Diana of Themyscira,

1364
01:43:52,519 --> 01:43:54,605
<i>daughter of Hippolyta,</i>

1365
01:43:55,480 --> 01:43:57,816
Queen of the Amazons.

1366
01:44:01,069 --> 01:44:03,822
And your wrath upon this world is over.

1367
01:44:20,631 --> 01:44:23,383
In the name of all
that is good in this world,

1368
01:44:23,550 --> 01:44:26,261
I hereby complete
the mission of the Amazons

1369
01:44:26,428 --> 01:44:28,263
by ridding this world of you

1370
01:44:28,430 --> 01:44:29,514
forever!

1371
01:45:36,748 --> 01:45:37,749
<i>Diana?</i>

1372
01:45:43,839 --> 01:45:45,090
Diana!

1373
01:45:49,261 --> 01:45:50,512
I killed him.

1374
01:45:52,097 --> 01:45:54,266
I killed him, but nothing stopped.

1375
01:45:56,435 --> 01:45:58,645
You kill the God of War,
you stop the war.

1376
01:45:58,812 --> 01:46:00,897
Exactly what we have to do now.

1377
01:46:01,064 --> 01:46:02,482
We need to stop the gas. Come on.

1378
01:46:02,649 --> 01:46:04,085
No. All of this should have stopped!

1379
01:46:04,109 --> 01:46:05,110
Diana...

1380
01:46:05,277 --> 01:46:07,255
The fighting should have stopped.
Why are they doing this?

1381
01:46:07,279 --> 01:46:09,281
I don't know! I don't know.

1382
01:46:09,448 --> 01:46:11,116
Ares is dead.

1383
01:46:11,283 --> 01:46:13,493
They can stop fighting now.
Why are they still fighting?

1384
01:46:13,660 --> 01:46:15,287
Because, maybe it's them!

1385
01:46:15,829 --> 01:46:16,830
Maybe...

1386
01:46:18,790 --> 01:46:21,418
Maybe people aren't always good.

1387
01:46:22,294 --> 01:46:24,171
Ares or no Ares,

1388
01:46:25,464 --> 01:46:28,842
maybe it's just who they are.

1389
01:46:31,678 --> 01:46:33,055
- Diana...
- No.

1390
01:46:33,221 --> 01:46:34,723
Diana, we can talk about this later.

1391
01:46:34,890 --> 01:46:36,117
- I need you to come with me.
- No. No.

1392
01:46:36,141 --> 01:46:38,060
After everything I saw, it can't be!

1393
01:46:38,226 --> 01:46:39,686
It cannot be!

1394
01:46:40,312 --> 01:46:42,064
They were killing each other.

1395
01:46:42,230 --> 01:46:44,983
Killing people they cannot see.
Children...

1396
01:46:45,150 --> 01:46:46,693
Children!

1397
01:46:46,902 --> 01:46:49,321
No, it had to be him.
It cannot be them!

1398
01:46:49,488 --> 01:46:51,907
Diana, people... I...

1399
01:46:52,074 --> 01:46:53,575
She was right.

1400
01:46:54,159 --> 01:46:55,160
My mother was right.

1401
01:46:55,327 --> 01:46:57,245
She said,
"The world of men do not deserve you."

1402
01:46:57,412 --> 01:46:59,289
They don't deserve our help, Steve.

1403
01:46:59,456 --> 01:47:01,656
- It's not about deserve!
- They don't deserve our help.

1404
01:47:01,750 --> 01:47:03,585
Maybe we don't!

1405
01:47:05,212 --> 01:47:07,464
But it's not about that.
It's about what you believe.

1406
01:47:08,507 --> 01:47:11,343
You don't think I get it
after what I've seen out there?

1407
01:47:13,512 --> 01:47:16,392
You don't think I wish I could tell you
that it was one bad guy to blame?

1408
01:47:17,057 --> 01:47:18,558
It's not!

1409
01:47:20,936 --> 01:47:22,562
We're all to blame.

1410
01:47:22,854 --> 01:47:23,855
I am not.

1411
01:47:25,398 --> 01:47:27,192
But maybe I am!

1412
01:47:31,154 --> 01:47:32,239
Please.

1413
01:47:32,405 --> 01:47:34,199
If you believe that
this war should stop,

1414
01:47:34,366 --> 01:47:36,118
if you want to stop it,

1415
01:47:36,284 --> 01:47:38,537
help me stop it right now.

1416
01:47:40,247 --> 01:47:43,083
Because, if you don't,
they will kill thousands more.

1417
01:47:43,708 --> 01:47:45,669
Please, please come with me.

1418
01:47:45,836 --> 01:47:47,379
I have to go.

1419
01:47:52,926 --> 01:47:55,387
I have to go.

1420
01:48:07,232 --> 01:48:08,233
Hey! Hey!

1421
01:48:12,737 --> 01:48:14,156
- Where's Diana?
- We're on our own.

1422
01:48:14,322 --> 01:48:16,783
- What?
- What do you see, Charlie?

1423
01:48:17,492 --> 01:48:19,119
<i>Looks like a bunch of gas bombs</i>

1424
01:48:19,286 --> 01:48:21,913
but I can't see
where they're taking them.

1425
01:48:22,080 --> 01:48:23,415
<i>How are we going to get in there?</i>

1426
01:48:24,082 --> 01:48:26,126
I've got an idea. Come on, guys.

1427
01:48:26,293 --> 01:48:27,419
Come on!

1428
01:48:41,266 --> 01:48:42,809
Who's there?

1429
01:48:55,488 --> 01:48:57,032
Sir Patrick.

1430
01:48:57,782 --> 01:49:02,120
You were right, Diana.
They don't deserve our help.

1431
01:49:03,288 --> 01:49:07,250
They only deserve destruction.

1432
01:49:08,293 --> 01:49:09,711
You...

1433
01:49:11,630 --> 01:49:13,632
You're him.

1434
01:49:17,052 --> 01:49:18,470
I am.

1435
01:49:19,054 --> 01:49:23,975
But I am not what you thought I was.

1436
01:49:44,120 --> 01:49:45,705
What is it?

1437
01:49:46,998 --> 01:49:48,416
The future.

1438
01:49:53,004 --> 01:49:55,173
I am not your enemy, Diana.

1439
01:49:57,008 --> 01:50:00,845
I am the only one who truly knows you.

1440
01:50:01,012 --> 01:50:05,433
And who truly knows them, as you now do.

1441
01:50:07,852 --> 01:50:11,690
They have always been,
and always will be

1442
01:50:11,856 --> 01:50:15,694
weak, cruel, selfish,

1443
01:50:15,860 --> 01:50:19,030
and capable of the greatest horrors.

1444
01:50:28,373 --> 01:50:29,874
All I ever wanted

1445
01:50:30,041 --> 01:50:35,005
was for the Gods to see how evil
my father's creation was.

1446
01:50:36,923 --> 01:50:38,633
But they refused.

1447
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:40,051
I am Diana of Themyscira...

1448
01:50:40,218 --> 01:50:41,219
So I destroyed them.

1449
01:50:41,386 --> 01:50:43,388
...daughter of Hippolyta,

1450
01:50:43,555 --> 01:50:44,795
and I'm here to complete her...

1451
01:50:53,565 --> 01:50:54,816
The Godkiller...

1452
01:50:57,861 --> 01:50:59,779
My dear child,

1453
01:51:01,156 --> 01:51:03,658
that is not the Godkiller.

1454
01:51:06,161 --> 01:51:07,704
You are.

1455
01:51:10,415 --> 01:51:13,418
Only a god can kill another god.

1456
01:51:14,419 --> 01:51:18,340
Zeus left the child he had
with the Queen of the Amazons

1457
01:51:18,506 --> 01:51:20,592
as a weapon to use against me.

1458
01:51:20,759 --> 01:51:22,594
No. You liar.

1459
01:51:24,304 --> 01:51:26,765
I compel you to tell me the truth.

1460
01:51:29,100 --> 01:51:30,810
I am.

1461
01:51:56,961 --> 01:51:59,339
I am not the God of War, Diana.

1462
01:51:59,506 --> 01:52:02,217
I am the God of Truth.

1463
01:52:03,510 --> 01:52:05,011
Mankind

1464
01:52:05,637 --> 01:52:07,806
stole this world from us.

1465
01:52:10,475 --> 01:52:14,020
<i>They ruined it, day by day.</i>

1466
01:52:14,187 --> 01:52:18,358
<i>And I, the only one
wise enough to see it,</i>

1467
01:52:20,026 --> 01:52:22,779
<i>was left too weak to stop them.</i>

1468
01:52:23,488 --> 01:52:27,117
<i>All these years,
I have struggled alone,</i>

1469
01:52:27,283 --> 01:52:29,202
<i>whispering into their ears.</i>

1470
01:52:29,369 --> 01:52:34,207
<i>Ideas, inspiration for formulas,</i>

1471
01:52:34,999 --> 01:52:36,626
<i>weapons,</i>

1472
01:52:39,129 --> 01:52:41,631
but I don't make them use them.

1473
01:52:42,507 --> 01:52:44,592
They start these wars on their own.

1474
01:52:45,718 --> 01:52:49,514
<i>All I do is orchestrate an armistice
I know they cannot keep,</i>

1475
01:52:49,681 --> 01:52:52,225
<i>in the hope
they will destroy themselves.</i>

1476
01:52:53,977 --> 01:52:56,020
<i>But it has never been enough.</i>

1477
01:52:57,689 --> 01:52:59,441
Until you.

1478
01:53:01,484 --> 01:53:05,738
<i>When you first arrived,
I was going to crush you.</i>

1479
01:53:06,239 --> 01:53:09,492
<i>But I knew that
if only you could see</i>

1480
01:53:09,659 --> 01:53:12,495
what the other gods could not,

1481
01:53:14,873 --> 01:53:19,419
then you would join me,
and with our powers combined,

1482
01:53:19,586 --> 01:53:23,590
we could finally end all the pain,
all the suffering,

1483
01:53:23,756 --> 01:53:26,468
the destruction they bring.

1484
01:53:26,634 --> 01:53:31,931
And we could return this world
to the paradise it was before them.

1485
01:53:33,391 --> 01:53:35,018
<i>Forever.</i>

1486
01:53:37,896 --> 01:53:39,439
<i>I...</i>

1487
01:53:44,110 --> 01:53:46,988
I could never be a part of that.

1488
01:53:50,241 --> 01:53:52,869
My dear, I don't want to fight you.

1489
01:53:53,953 --> 01:53:55,330
<i>But, if I must...</i>

1490
01:54:04,797 --> 01:54:06,591
- Steve!
- Come on, let's go!

1491
01:54:07,300 --> 01:54:08,426
<i>Sammy, let's go!</i>

1492
01:54:09,052 --> 01:54:10,720
Get this plane out of here!

1493
01:54:40,667 --> 01:54:45,088
Oh, my dear, you have so much to learn.

1494
01:55:10,196 --> 01:55:12,532
Oh, my God!

1495
01:55:12,699 --> 01:55:13,992
What are we gonna do?

1496
01:55:15,827 --> 01:55:18,037
There's not much we can do,

1497
01:55:18,496 --> 01:55:19,998
if that's who I think it is.

1498
01:55:26,004 --> 01:55:27,922
But we can stop that plane.

1499
01:55:40,977 --> 01:55:43,021
<i>If we can get on the radio,</i>

1500
01:55:43,187 --> 01:55:45,064
we can ask Flying Corps
to shoot her down.

1501
01:55:45,231 --> 01:55:48,359
No. If it crashes, it'll wipe everyone out
for 50 square miles!

1502
01:55:48,526 --> 01:55:49,527
We gotta ground it!

1503
01:55:49,694 --> 01:55:51,529
Bad news. It's on a timer.

1504
01:55:51,696 --> 01:55:54,073
If we ground it here,
it's the same thing.

1505
01:56:01,039 --> 01:56:02,832
Is it flammable, Chief?

1506
01:56:02,999 --> 01:56:06,377
Yeah, she said it's hydrogen.
It's flammable.

1507
01:56:13,426 --> 01:56:15,720
I need you guys to clear me a path
to that plane.

1508
01:56:15,887 --> 01:56:18,097
- No, Steve!
- Hey, Steve!

1509
01:56:19,390 --> 01:56:20,391
Come on!

1510
01:57:03,768 --> 01:57:05,561
Come on! This way! Steve!

1511
01:57:15,947 --> 01:57:17,156
- Go, Steve, come on.
- Go!

1512
01:57:17,949 --> 01:57:19,325
Steve!

1513
01:57:22,161 --> 01:57:24,122
- Go, Steve. Come on.
- Run, run!

1514
01:58:02,243 --> 01:58:05,663
Let's see what kind of god
you really are.

1515
01:58:31,856 --> 01:58:34,525
<i>You will help me destroy them, Diana,</i>

1516
01:58:38,654 --> 01:58:40,531
<i>or you will die.</i>

1517
01:58:50,500 --> 01:58:52,752
<i>Come on, come on.
Let's go, go, go!</i>

1518
01:58:54,796 --> 01:58:57,048
- Move it, boys! Now!
- Let's go! Run!

1519
01:59:22,907 --> 01:59:25,618
Is that all you have to offer?

1520
01:59:41,843 --> 01:59:45,763
It is futile to imagine you can win.

1521
01:59:46,556 --> 01:59:48,182
Give up, Diana.

1522
01:59:48,349 --> 01:59:49,350
<i>Guys, I'm out.</i>

1523
01:59:52,353 --> 01:59:53,604
Chief! Anything left?

1524
01:59:53,771 --> 01:59:54,856
I got nothing.

1525
01:59:55,022 --> 01:59:56,065
- Anything!
<i>- No.</i>

1526
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:15,167
Steve.

1527
02:01:01,547 --> 02:01:02,965
Steve...

1528
02:01:06,469 --> 02:01:08,846
No!

1529
02:01:43,798 --> 02:01:46,092
<i>Yes, Diana!</i>

1530
02:01:46,258 --> 02:01:48,970
<i>Take them all!</i>

1531
02:01:49,136 --> 02:01:52,098
<i>Finally, you see.</i>

1532
02:01:52,723 --> 02:01:55,142
Look at this world.

1533
02:01:56,060 --> 02:01:58,854
<i>Mankind did this, not me.</i>

1534
02:02:00,064 --> 02:02:01,983
<i>They are ugly,</i>

1535
02:02:02,149 --> 02:02:04,235
<i>filled with hatred,</i>

1536
02:02:04,402 --> 02:02:05,653
<i>weak,</i>

1537
02:02:05,820 --> 02:02:08,906
<i>just like your Captain Trevor.</i>

1538
02:02:09,073 --> 02:02:11,909
Gone, and left you nothing.

1539
02:02:12,743 --> 02:02:14,912
<i>And for what?</i>

1540
02:02:15,329 --> 02:02:16,622
<i>Pathetic!</i>

1541
02:02:18,457 --> 02:02:19,750
He deserved to burn!

1542
02:02:30,761 --> 02:02:34,473
<i>Look at her and tell me I'm wrong.</i>

1543
02:02:43,607 --> 02:02:47,611
<i>She is the perfect example
of these humans</i>

1544
02:02:49,405 --> 02:02:53,200
<i>and unworthy of your sympathy
in every way.</i>

1545
02:02:54,452 --> 02:02:56,954
Destroy her, Diana.

1546
02:02:57,621 --> 02:03:01,042
<i>You know that she deserves it.
They all do.</i>

1547
02:03:04,628 --> 02:03:06,088
Do it!

1548
02:03:10,801 --> 02:03:12,470
<i>Diana!</i>

1549
02:03:15,848 --> 02:03:17,266
<i>Diana...</i>

1550
02:03:26,025 --> 02:03:27,026
What?

1551
02:03:28,152 --> 02:03:29,820
I have to go.

1552
02:03:32,531 --> 02:03:33,991
What are you saying?

1553
02:03:34,366 --> 02:03:35,367
Steve,

1554
02:03:36,035 --> 02:03:38,329
whatever it is, I can do it.

1555
02:03:38,496 --> 02:03:39,497
No. No.

1556
02:03:39,663 --> 02:03:41,290
- Let me do it.
- No.

1557
02:03:41,457 --> 02:03:43,000
It has to be me.

1558
02:03:43,167 --> 02:03:44,960
It has to be me.

1559
02:03:45,127 --> 02:03:48,130
I can save today.
You could save the world.

1560
02:03:56,972 --> 02:03:59,600
I wish we had more time.

1561
02:04:00,184 --> 02:04:02,686
What? What are you saying?

1562
02:04:05,356 --> 02:04:06,524
I love you!

1563
02:04:18,536 --> 02:04:19,829
You're wrong about them.

1564
02:04:29,755 --> 02:04:31,507
They're everything you say,

1565
02:04:32,258 --> 02:04:34,009
but so much more.

1566
02:04:34,176 --> 02:04:35,553
Lies!

1567
02:05:01,787 --> 02:05:05,416
They do not deserve your protection!

1568
02:05:07,209 --> 02:05:08,377
It's not about deserve.

1569
02:05:13,257 --> 02:05:15,176
It's about what you believe.

1570
02:05:18,429 --> 02:05:19,930
And I believe in love.

1571
02:05:20,097 --> 02:05:24,393
Then I will destroy you!

1572
02:05:52,296 --> 02:05:53,964
Goodbye, brother.

1573
02:09:26,218 --> 02:09:28,554
<i>I used to want to save the world.</i>

1574
02:09:29,721 --> 02:09:33,475
<i>To end war and bring peace to mankind.</i>

1575
02:09:34,059 --> 02:09:37,896
<i>But then I glimpsed the darkness
that lives within their light</i>

1576
02:09:38,814 --> 02:09:41,150
<i>and learned that inside
every one of them,</i>

1577
02:09:41,733 --> 02:09:43,986
<i>there will always be both.</i>

1578
02:09:44,862 --> 02:09:47,739
<i>A choice each must make
for themselves.</i>

1579
02:09:47,906 --> 02:09:51,326
<i>Something no hero will ever defeat.</i>

1580
02:09:53,036 --> 02:09:54,037
<i>And now I know</i>

1581
02:09:54,997 --> 02:09:59,626
<i>that only love can truly save the world.</i>

1582
02:10:01,503 --> 02:10:03,172
<i>So, I stay,</i>

1583
02:10:03,338 --> 02:10:05,507
<i>I fight, and I give,</i>

1584
02:10:08,260 --> 02:10:10,262
<i>for the world I know can be.</i>

1585
02:10:15,017 --> 02:10:16,226
<i>This is my mission now.</i>

1586
02:10:19,605 --> 02:10:20,939
<i>Forever.</i>

1587
02:10:21,305 --> 02:11:21,698
