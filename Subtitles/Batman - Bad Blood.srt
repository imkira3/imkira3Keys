00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,584
<i>In other news, Chuckie Sol,
a made man in the Black Mask mob</i>

3
00:00:18,684 --> 00:00:22,322
<i>was kidnapped at gunpoint
by masked assailants earlier today.</i>

4
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:26,192
<i>Suspicion is high that Sol was a victim
of the recent turf war</i>

5
00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:28,561
<i>raging between the mob
and a new rival gang</i>

6
00:00:28,661 --> 00:00:32,796
<i>composed of high-tech criminals
known to have crossed paths with Batman.</i>

7
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:37,344
I don't know about any weapon shipment,
Tusk. Mask don't tell us...

8
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:41,305
You could do better than that, Chuckie.
We ain't got all night.

9
00:00:45,377 --> 00:00:51,078
Old Electrocutioner here gets
mighty ticked when someone lies.

10
00:00:51,516 --> 00:00:54,913
When is that weapons shipment due?

11
00:01:12,871 --> 00:01:15,909
Wait... Batman doesn't use guns.

12
00:01:16,309 --> 00:01:18,444
Batman doesn't.

13
00:01:18,544 --> 00:01:20,358
But I do.

14
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:35,420
- I'm just the accountant.
- Shut it!

15
00:01:57,983 --> 00:02:00,478
That's no way to treat a lady.

16
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:17,637
I could've handled these C-listers
on my own.

17
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:22,278
Dressing like a bat doesn't make you
a hero. It just makes you a target.

18
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:26,661
And using a gun makes you just like them.

19
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:35,169
I want you out of here. Now!

20
00:03:31,309 --> 00:03:33,094
Down!

21
00:03:41,986 --> 00:03:45,124
This wasn't a break-in. Was it, Firefly?

22
00:03:45,224 --> 00:03:46,612
Of course not.

23
00:03:46,712 --> 00:03:50,277
- They're working for someone new.
- Who?

24
00:03:53,064 --> 00:03:58,087
This is truly an honor, Batman.
I've waited so very long for this moment.

25
00:03:58,187 --> 00:04:01,872
Though the circumstances
are less than ideal.

26
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:03,704
Do I know you?

27
00:04:03,804 --> 00:04:07,676
Intimately... and not at all.

28
00:04:11,299 --> 00:04:14,105
And you rag on me for stealing your look.

29
00:04:37,893 --> 00:04:39,832
Onyx, now.

30
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,931
Rest well, Batman.

31
00:06:00,176 --> 00:06:03,066
<i>It's not like he punches a time clock,
but I can assure you</i>

32
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:07,717
<i>that the Gotham Police Force is more
than capable of keeping this city safe.</i>

33
00:06:07,817 --> 00:06:10,901
<i>Even without a masked hero to back us up.</i>

34
00:06:13,488 --> 00:06:15,986
You're a bad liar, Gordon.

35
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:33,476
- <i>So, are on your way?</i>
- Yeah, babe. You can't believe the traffic.

36
00:06:34,526 --> 00:06:36,410
It's Blockbuster!

37
00:06:44,376 --> 00:06:48,400
<i>Can't wait to see you.
It's been weeks, Dick.</i>

38
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,960
<i>I've almost forgotten what you feel like.</i>

39
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,143
I'll remind...

40
00:06:56,037 --> 00:07:00,183
- <i>It's... What's all that noise?</i>
- Construction.

41
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:04,890
Hold on, I think I see an opening.

42
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:15,499
Yup. All clear, Kori.
I'll be at the tower in fi...

43
00:07:16,819 --> 00:07:19,855
Babe, you have no idea
how sorry I am, but...

44
00:07:19,955 --> 00:07:24,660
- <i>But, what about our...</i>
- Got a family emergency. Nightwing out.

45
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,978
Your timing really sucks, Alfred.

46
00:07:39,323 --> 00:07:43,262
Well, your trip to the rainforest
seems ill-timed, Mr. Wayne.

47
00:07:43,462 --> 00:07:47,483
- With the world tech summit coming up...
- <i>It's not for another week, Ms. Bannister.</i>

48
00:07:47,883 --> 00:07:49,451
<i>We're down here studying rare herbs</i>

49
00:07:49,551 --> 00:07:52,087
<i>that could prove revolutionary
for medical research.</i>

50
00:07:52,187 --> 00:07:55,391
And earn millions
for our pharmaceutical interests.

51
00:07:55,491 --> 00:07:59,895
All well and good. But why did you
have to lead the team?

52
00:08:00,095 --> 00:08:01,730
<i>Because it's my company.</i>

53
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:04,383
<i>And I can do whatever
the bloody hell I want to.</i>

54
00:08:04,483 --> 00:08:08,237
<i>You still have to answer to this board,
Mr. Wayne. And frankly...</i>

55
00:08:08,337 --> 00:08:10,005
I think we're done here.

56
00:08:10,105 --> 00:08:13,876
If any of you have further concerns,
bring them to Lucius.

57
00:08:13,976 --> 00:08:17,861
He's more than capable
of handling things while I'm gone.

58
00:08:22,885 --> 00:08:24,620
Oh, dear.

59
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,656
I'd watch those "bloody hells," governor.

60
00:08:27,756 --> 00:08:29,291
Don't want to be giving yourself away.

61
00:08:29,391 --> 00:08:34,296
Master Dick. It's bad manners
to sneak up on a person like that.

62
00:08:34,396 --> 00:08:38,114
Sneaking up on people is kind
of what we do around here, Alfred.

63
00:08:38,633 --> 00:08:40,635
That's a joke.

64
00:08:40,735 --> 00:08:44,023
We are not amused.

65
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:47,474
I'm not exactly in a festive mood either.

66
00:08:48,743 --> 00:08:53,798
- How long has he been gone?
- Two weeks, one day, 15 hours.

67
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:56,001
Wouldn't be the first time.

68
00:08:56,351 --> 00:09:01,256
But he's never been gone this long
without notifying me in some way.

69
00:09:01,356 --> 00:09:05,527
Last night, the signal was up for an hour.
Third time this week.

70
00:09:05,627 --> 00:09:08,147
And if the police are aware
of his absence,

71
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:11,750
then you can be certain
the criminal class is as well.

72
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:16,005
There's already been a sharp uptick
in underworld activities.

73
00:09:16,105 --> 00:09:18,390
If Batman doesn't return soon...

74
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:21,907
I know. All bloody hell's
gonna break loose.

75
00:09:23,411 --> 00:09:27,207
Even when you've disappeared,
I can't get away from you.

76
00:09:29,984 --> 00:09:33,322
Oh, Mr. Fox.
I think it's way past time we...

77
00:09:33,422 --> 00:09:38,842
Apologies, Ms. Bannister. I have
an important visitor who simply can't wait.

78
00:09:43,488 --> 00:09:45,768
- That woman!
- What's wrong, Dad?

79
00:09:45,868 --> 00:09:50,105
Bannister's been barking at you for years.
You never let her get under your skin.

80
00:09:50,205 --> 00:09:52,508
Maybe I'm getting too old for this.

81
00:09:52,608 --> 00:09:54,977
Come on. Let's get some grub.

82
00:09:55,477 --> 00:10:00,182
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to cancel, Luke.
Too much on my plate right here.

83
00:10:00,282 --> 00:10:02,806
Of course, if you'd finally
accept Mr. Wayne's offer,

84
00:10:02,906 --> 00:10:05,254
- we could do lunch every day.
- Dad...

85
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:07,489
With your background
in physics and math...

86
00:10:07,589 --> 00:10:09,892
- Dad...
- ...you'd be an extraordinary asset.

87
00:10:09,992 --> 00:10:15,230
Dad! I said no before I went
into the service and it's still no.

88
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:16,132
Why?

89
00:10:16,232 --> 00:10:19,049
You're the one who told me
to follow my own path.

90
00:10:21,636 --> 00:10:26,723
Yes. But I never thought
it would take you to Afghanistan.

91
00:10:42,823 --> 00:10:45,482
I thought your doctor
told you to give that up.

92
00:10:50,264 --> 00:10:53,969
I've decided to live dangerously.
Like my daughter.

93
00:10:54,069 --> 00:10:58,073
As I recall, I picked up the art
of dangerous living from you, Colonel Kane.

94
00:10:58,173 --> 00:10:59,241
How are you, Dad?

95
00:10:59,341 --> 00:11:03,462
I'm more concerned with how you are,
Kate. I haven't seen you in weeks.

96
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:06,857
I was hoping you'd met some nice girl.

97
00:11:07,883 --> 00:11:12,153
I've been trying to find out something,
anything, about my mystery man.

98
00:11:12,253 --> 00:11:15,244
- And?
- It's like he doesn't even exist.

99
00:11:15,344 --> 00:11:19,812
- What about his friends?
- Vanished without a trace.

100
00:11:19,912 --> 00:11:23,565
I watched that place blow apart, Dad.
There was no way he could've escaped.

101
00:11:23,665 --> 00:11:26,335
And I keep wondering
if there was something...

102
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:28,791
Anything that I could've done.

103
00:11:28,891 --> 00:11:32,958
Are you sure he's dead, Kate?
This is Batman we're talking about.

104
00:11:33,308 --> 00:11:35,994
No one could've survived that.

105
00:11:36,094 --> 00:11:38,779
I need your help on this one.

106
00:11:42,316 --> 00:11:44,954
Your mother always thought
you'd be an artist.

107
00:11:45,054 --> 00:11:48,245
Elizabeth was the one
with the real talent.

108
00:11:56,631 --> 00:11:59,849
Katey. Are you okay?

109
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:04,121
Kate?

110
00:12:05,774 --> 00:12:09,259
I'll see what my network can dig up
on your mystery man.

111
00:12:10,711 --> 00:12:13,849
They keep hoping
for an answer, don't they?

112
00:12:13,949 --> 00:12:17,367
- Why don't you give them one.
- Not my style.

113
00:12:27,795 --> 00:12:31,147
It seems reports of his death
have been greatly...

114
00:12:33,134 --> 00:12:35,218
exaggerated.

115
00:12:37,355 --> 00:12:39,639
Watch your back, Kate.

116
00:12:49,183 --> 00:12:51,320
New guy thinks he can move in.

117
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:54,890
I'm gonna show those punks
who's top dog around here.

118
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:59,061
- Gotham's my bitch.
- Which makes you mine, Mask.

119
00:12:59,161 --> 00:13:02,850
You're supposed to be dead.
Let me fix that for you.

120
00:13:22,116 --> 00:13:23,834
Damn it!

121
00:13:27,988 --> 00:13:31,741
I bet 50 grand that you
were dead this time.

122
00:13:32,427 --> 00:13:34,564
You lost.

123
00:13:34,664 --> 00:13:37,013
Always bet on Black.

124
00:13:50,378 --> 00:13:54,397
Robin? Somebody kill this freaking kid!

125
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:07,561
Damian?

126
00:14:52,373 --> 00:14:55,644
- What?
- I could've handled this alone.

127
00:14:55,844 --> 00:15:00,316
If that's your best, Batman,
you're not gonna fool anyone, Grayson.

128
00:15:01,216 --> 00:15:04,534
Maybe you'd like a megaphone
to announce that?

129
00:15:12,527 --> 00:15:14,864
There's no way you're gonna
pull this off without my help.

130
00:15:15,364 --> 00:15:16,532
Modest as ever, I see.

131
00:15:16,632 --> 00:15:20,231
I'm more Batman than you'll ever be.
Just follow my lead.

132
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:24,888
We're being tailed.

133
00:15:53,267 --> 00:15:55,950
You've been tracking me all night.

134
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:58,373
I want to know why.

135
00:15:58,473 --> 00:16:02,077
First, tell me why you're running
around Gotham playing dress-up.

136
00:16:02,177 --> 00:16:04,127
I'm guessing Nightwing?

137
00:16:06,213 --> 00:16:07,182
Busted.

138
00:16:07,282 --> 00:16:10,485
Actually, I think he's more than capable
of fooling most people.

139
00:16:10,585 --> 00:16:13,407
And you're certainly not gonna
pass for Batman, short stack.

140
00:16:13,855 --> 00:16:16,825
- Who the hell are you?
- Easy, Robin.

141
00:16:16,925 --> 00:16:19,361
Tell me what you want
and why you've been following me.

142
00:16:19,461 --> 00:16:23,427
I just had to make sure. You see,
I was there the night Batman died.

143
00:16:28,068 --> 00:16:30,238
He threw me clear and saved my life.

144
00:16:30,338 --> 00:16:34,290
But before I could get
back up here it blew apart.

145
00:16:35,609 --> 00:16:38,680
- And we're just supposed to believe that?
- Believe what you want.

146
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:42,799
- I don't trust her.
- Oh, but you did trust Talon.

147
00:16:43,117 --> 00:16:44,483
Shut up.

148
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:48,023
Who was it? Who were Tusk
and Firefly working for?

149
00:16:48,123 --> 00:16:52,594
I don't know. But when I find out,
I'll drop a note in your lunchbox.

150
00:16:52,694 --> 00:16:55,898
If you're serious about hunting them down
then we should work together.

151
00:16:56,198 --> 00:17:00,180
Just because I wear this,
doesn't mean I'm a part of your little cult.

152
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:09,392
You really have a way with women, Grayson.

153
00:17:16,684 --> 00:17:19,203
Do you think he's really dead?

154
00:17:19,303 --> 00:17:20,505
I don't know.

155
00:17:20,605 --> 00:17:23,692
You'd like it, wouldn't you...
if he never came back?

156
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:26,342
Then you get to keep that suit.

157
00:17:32,566 --> 00:17:35,270
I've struggled for years
to get out of Bruce's shadow,

158
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:39,057
to build a life for myself as far away
from his world as possible.

159
00:17:39,157 --> 00:17:43,060
And the last thing I want
is to be wearing this damn thing!

160
00:17:45,848 --> 00:17:49,905
<i>I've finally managed to locate
Master Bruce's files on Batwoman.</i>

161
00:17:50,005 --> 00:17:51,420
How come I never heard of her?

162
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:56,606
- <i>She's kept a rather low profile.</i>
- Not low enough for Batman, I'll bet.

163
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:02,096
<i>Investigative report on Batwoman,
aka Katherine Kane.</i>

164
00:18:02,196 --> 00:18:04,633
- Katey?
- You know her?

165
00:18:05,033 --> 00:18:08,371
<i>Her father is Colonel Jacob Kane.
Military intelligence.</i>

166
00:18:08,771 --> 00:18:13,141
<i>On Katherine's 12th birthday, she and
her twin sister Elizabeth were abducted,</i>

167
00:18:13,241 --> 00:18:16,895
<i>along with their mother, Gabrielle,
and held for ransom.</i>

168
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:20,415
<i>Colonel Kane led a rescue mission
that saved Kate's life.</i>

169
00:18:20,515 --> 00:18:24,683
<i>But in the attempt both Gabrielle
and Elizabeth were murdered.</i>

170
00:18:24,783 --> 00:18:27,890
<i>She would follow in her father's footsteps,
enrolling at West Point,</i>

171
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:32,244
<i>but ultimately expelled.
Something broke inside Kate.</i>

172
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:35,397
<i>Two years later,
Katherine emerged as Batwoman.</i>

173
00:18:35,497 --> 00:18:39,301
<i>She's impressive, but her methods
make her a danger to this city.</i>

174
00:18:39,401 --> 00:18:40,769
<i>And to herself.</i>

175
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:44,082
<i>It's time for me to decide if I'm going
to take her under my wing...</i>

176
00:18:46,207 --> 00:18:48,552
<i>or take her down.</i>

177
00:18:50,645 --> 00:18:54,303
Poor Katey. It always begins
with death. Doesn't it, Alfred?

178
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:57,652
<i>I'm as astonished as you are, Master Dick.</i>

179
00:18:57,752 --> 00:19:01,272
Anyone mind filling me in?
How do you know her?

180
00:19:01,372 --> 00:19:03,003
I just do.

181
00:19:15,469 --> 00:19:17,572
I had to dig very deep, my dear,

182
00:19:17,672 --> 00:19:21,209
reach out to contacts
that even I find somewhat unsavory.

183
00:19:21,309 --> 00:19:24,246
But here he is, your mystery man.

184
00:19:24,346 --> 00:19:28,350
The Heretic. That's his accomplice. Onyx.

185
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:31,086
Heretic? What kind of name is that?

186
00:19:31,186 --> 00:19:35,397
One that invokes disbelief.
His accomplishments certainly do.

187
00:19:35,857 --> 00:19:40,128
In the last 10 months, he has quietly
forged some dangerous alliances,

188
00:19:40,228 --> 00:19:42,964
as well as become a Thorn
in the side of Black Mask.

189
00:19:43,064 --> 00:19:46,485
He may have gathered half the criminals
in Gotham under his command.

190
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:48,710
- But who is he?
- All I know is...

191
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:53,174
that he's left a trail of empty vaults
and dead bodies across this city.

192
00:19:53,274 --> 00:19:58,179
And as your experience attests,
he seems to have a fixation with Batman.

193
00:19:58,279 --> 00:20:01,216
With all due respect, Dad,
that doesn't help much.

194
00:20:01,316 --> 00:20:05,529
I'm sorry. I just need
to figure this out on my own.

195
00:20:06,437 --> 00:20:08,983
I'll see you back at the house.

196
00:20:10,307 --> 00:20:14,122
Don't worry, Kate.
I won't let you down again.

197
00:20:24,838 --> 00:20:28,510
If you're gonna keep standing me up
for dinner, Dad, you could at least call.

198
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:32,723
Oh, God. Luke, I'm sorry.
I'm just swamped.

199
00:20:36,884 --> 00:20:39,496
It's not just the summit, is it?

200
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,923
Excuse me?

201
00:20:41,023 --> 00:20:43,774
This has something to do
with the fact that Batman's missing.

202
00:20:43,874 --> 00:20:45,440
Batman?

203
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:48,907
Dad, you've been bringing me here
since I was a kid.

204
00:20:49,007 --> 00:20:50,836
I've seen enough over the years
to figure out

205
00:20:50,936 --> 00:20:53,989
that there's some connection between
Wayne Enterprises and Batman.

206
00:20:54,089 --> 00:20:56,905
Somehow I missed that
in the last stockholder's report.

207
00:20:57,005 --> 00:21:00,308
In fact, if I was gonna make
an educated guess,

208
00:21:00,408 --> 00:21:02,644
I'd say you supply him
with some of his tech.

209
00:21:02,744 --> 00:21:06,124
- That's some theory.
- Dad, I just...

210
00:21:29,904 --> 00:21:33,265
It's coming from Wayne Tech. The vault.

211
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:43,317
Don't play games with me.

212
00:21:43,417 --> 00:21:46,430
I don't know about any vault.

213
00:21:47,021 --> 00:21:49,595
Fine. Kill him.

214
00:22:03,103 --> 00:22:08,806
Get us into the vault, Mr. Fox,
or your son becomes a memory.

215
00:22:09,811 --> 00:22:11,622
Stop!

216
00:22:37,737 --> 00:22:40,775
Look at all these magnificent toys.

217
00:22:40,975 --> 00:22:42,711
You know what we need, Kuttler.

218
00:22:42,811 --> 00:22:46,264
Yes. A fleet of trucks,
so we can take it all.

219
00:22:46,364 --> 00:22:50,411
But for now...
the components will have to do.

220
00:23:05,132 --> 00:23:07,001
How could you know?

221
00:23:07,101 --> 00:23:10,004
This is the 21st century, Mr. Fox.

222
00:23:10,104 --> 00:23:14,218
There are no secrets
in this world anymore.

223
00:23:15,442 --> 00:23:17,255
Dad!

224
00:23:19,112 --> 00:23:22,526
Except the ones we take to our graves.

225
00:23:56,616 --> 00:24:00,198
You dare to wear the mantle of the bat.

226
00:24:22,075 --> 00:24:24,688
Get to the transport.

227
00:24:29,516 --> 00:24:31,529
The boy.

228
00:24:34,489 --> 00:24:36,825
Electrocutioner, stop!

229
00:24:36,925 --> 00:24:41,038
You're gonna fry up real good,
you stupid little...

230
00:24:45,565 --> 00:24:48,072
Come back and fight, you cowards!

231
00:24:59,446 --> 00:25:02,493
- Damn it.
- Help!

232
00:25:02,683 --> 00:25:04,228
He needs an ambulance.

233
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:15,272
You want more, Bruce?

234
00:25:15,629 --> 00:25:17,936
Don't take it all for yourself.

235
00:25:18,036 --> 00:25:22,030
Don't worry, ladies.
There's plenty of me to go around.

236
00:25:22,703 --> 00:25:24,905
Mother's pearls?

237
00:25:25,005 --> 00:25:27,417
Where did you get those?

238
00:25:28,409 --> 00:25:30,688
Where did you get them?

239
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:39,697
What the hell is this?

240
00:26:48,823 --> 00:26:51,358
Still no progress, Tetch?

241
00:26:51,458 --> 00:26:55,229
So much memory. So much experience.

242
00:26:55,329 --> 00:26:58,699
It's a delicate job,
threading my way through the layers.

243
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:02,370
You, on the other hand,
could be reprogrammed in an hour.

244
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:05,906
You're like wet sand,
compared to this concrete.

245
00:27:06,006 --> 00:27:08,509
His trauma runs so deep.

246
00:27:08,609 --> 00:27:11,579
It's as if he defines himself by his pain.

247
00:27:11,979 --> 00:27:14,058
Such madness.

248
00:27:14,248 --> 00:27:16,693
You have to dig deeper.

249
00:27:18,068 --> 00:27:19,914
Push past the trauma.

250
00:27:22,824 --> 00:27:27,761
To the child he was,
before he lost his precious parents.

251
00:27:27,861 --> 00:27:30,407
Then, you'll break him.

252
00:27:34,501 --> 00:27:36,487
And then, he'll be ours.

253
00:27:36,587 --> 00:27:39,674
You make it sound so easy, Talia.

254
00:27:39,774 --> 00:27:42,810
Easier than dying, Mr. Tetch.

255
00:27:43,211 --> 00:27:47,615
We had the detonators.
But the bat was there, waiting for us.

256
00:27:47,715 --> 00:27:50,517
- Grayson.
- Not just him.

257
00:27:50,617 --> 00:27:52,520
- The boy.
- Of course.

258
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:55,356
He was nearly killed, but I saved him.

259
00:27:55,456 --> 00:27:58,927
- I saved him.
- I would expect no less.

260
00:27:59,027 --> 00:28:02,006
We should capture Damian. Bring him here.

261
00:28:04,764 --> 00:28:07,736
I prefer to keep my son
at arm's length. For now.

262
00:28:08,036 --> 00:28:10,702
But if we remove him
from the battle till it's over, then...

263
00:28:10,802 --> 00:28:13,283
I've told you, no.

264
00:28:15,075 --> 00:28:17,678
I know why you want the boy, Heretic.

265
00:28:17,778 --> 00:28:20,879
I'd stay away from that rabbit hole,
if I were you.

266
00:28:21,149 --> 00:28:24,027
Mind your own business, Tetch.

267
00:28:25,785 --> 00:28:29,256
Nothing would give me more pleasure.

268
00:28:41,234 --> 00:28:45,173
- I'm so sorry, Luke.
- That's all you have to say?

269
00:28:45,273 --> 00:28:47,942
I was in the vault, Dick. I know.

270
00:28:48,042 --> 00:28:51,421
Listen, I don't think this is the time.

271
00:28:52,179 --> 00:28:55,875
My dad might feel differently,
if he could talk.

272
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:02,757
I came home from one war,
only to walk right into another one.

273
00:29:02,857 --> 00:29:05,468
And I want to be a part of it.

274
00:29:05,925 --> 00:29:08,479
Best way to help is right here,
at your father's side.

275
00:29:08,579 --> 00:29:10,899
I'm a soldier, Dick.
I need to be on the front lines,

276
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:13,968
not stuck in some lab or boardroom
or freakin' bedside chair.

277
00:29:14,068 --> 00:29:16,904
And last night, I saw the weapons
that could help me.

278
00:29:17,004 --> 00:29:20,374
Weapons that my dad created
and almost got killed for.

279
00:29:20,774 --> 00:29:25,212
No, Luke, listen. I understand,
I really do, but it's not my call.

280
00:29:25,312 --> 00:29:29,492
Not right now. Things are complicated.
Trust me, okay?

281
00:29:31,885 --> 00:29:34,397
- Dick...
- Alfred.

282
00:29:35,188 --> 00:29:36,624
I'm on it.

283
00:29:36,724 --> 00:29:39,870
I got to run. I'm sorry.

284
00:29:53,941 --> 00:29:56,311
God, I haven't laughed
like that in so long.

285
00:29:56,611 --> 00:29:59,480
I noticed you looked pretty miserable
when you came in.

286
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,596
One of those days?

287
00:30:02,115 --> 00:30:04,556
One of those lives.

288
00:30:04,952 --> 00:30:07,625
- Hey!
- Excuse me.

289
00:30:08,555 --> 00:30:11,491
So, you're a cop?

290
00:30:11,591 --> 00:30:13,627
A detective.

291
00:30:14,027 --> 00:30:15,630
You have a problem with that?

292
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:18,532
No, not at all.

293
00:30:18,632 --> 00:30:22,006
You just don't look the part.

294
00:30:22,203 --> 00:30:26,807
- What's a cop supposed to look like?
- Not as hot as you.

295
00:30:27,265 --> 00:30:31,873
- Did I just say that out loud?
- Yeah, you did. You're good.

296
00:30:32,113 --> 00:30:36,189
Actually, I'm terrible.
I haven't dated in over a year and I...

297
00:30:42,605 --> 00:30:45,888
- Is something wrong?
- What? No. No. No.

298
00:30:45,988 --> 00:30:51,073
Look, I do have to go, but...
can I give you my card? Call me?

299
00:30:52,065 --> 00:30:53,367
Yeah, right.

300
00:30:53,467 --> 00:30:58,788
That's not a line, Rene, I...
I like you, I really do.

301
00:30:58,888 --> 00:31:01,429
But something's come up.

302
00:31:13,703 --> 00:31:15,344
Where's the kid?

303
00:31:17,924 --> 00:31:20,711
I thought we could talk alone... Katey.

304
00:31:22,095 --> 00:31:23,998
How long have you known?

305
00:31:24,098 --> 00:31:28,560
Me? Not long. But Batman's
been on to you from the start.

306
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:35,509
Look, just so you know, I haven't given up.
I just... needed to clear my head.

307
00:31:35,609 --> 00:31:38,683
We all need to take off
the mask sometimes.

308
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,284
To remind ourselves
that we're people underneath.

309
00:31:43,384 --> 00:31:45,453
Dick Grayson.

310
00:31:45,853 --> 00:31:49,824
You know, when we were kids and I'd
see you at all those society bashes...

311
00:31:49,924 --> 00:31:51,259
I had quite a crush on you.

312
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:54,099
Really? I thought
you were totally annoying.

313
00:31:55,895 --> 00:31:58,996
Took me a while to get a hang
of the girl thing.

314
00:31:59,096 --> 00:32:01,635
Yeah, me too.

315
00:32:01,735 --> 00:32:06,428
- Why reveal yourself?
- Call it a hunch. Come on.

316
00:32:08,209 --> 00:32:10,444
I don't have a concussion.

317
00:32:10,544 --> 00:32:13,334
I wasn't aware you received
a medical degree

318
00:32:13,434 --> 00:32:15,870
while you were in the Himalayas,
Master Damian.

319
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:19,287
I've been hurt worse than this
sparring with my grandfather.

320
00:32:19,387 --> 00:32:21,822
I'd hardly hold Ra's Al Ghul up

321
00:32:21,922 --> 00:32:25,226
as an example of enlightened
child-rearing.

322
00:32:25,326 --> 00:32:27,895
Master Dick was quite explicit.

323
00:32:27,995 --> 00:32:31,499
At least 24 hours of observation.

324
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:34,702
He's not my father! And neither are you.

325
00:32:35,002 --> 00:32:39,878
And for that, young man,
you should be profoundly grateful.

326
00:32:48,982 --> 00:32:52,152
He saved my life once before, you know.

327
00:32:52,252 --> 00:32:55,243
In a way, he created me.

328
00:32:55,343 --> 00:32:57,845
Yeah, he does that.

329
00:32:57,945 --> 00:32:59,780
He pissed me off.

330
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,320
He does that, too.

331
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:07,739
<i>When I got kicked out of the military,
my life was a blur of sex,</i>

332
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:10,841
<i>drugs and techno-house.</i>

333
00:33:10,941 --> 00:33:13,955
<i>But I thought I could take care of myself.</i>

334
00:33:17,664 --> 00:33:20,668
- How ya doin', gorgeous?
- Out of my way, asshole.

335
00:33:20,768 --> 00:33:22,974
I don't think so.

336
00:33:25,606 --> 00:33:27,857
You little bitch!

337
00:33:51,047 --> 00:33:52,907
You're welcome.

338
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:06,747
After that night, I swore I'd never need
Batman or anyone saving me again.

339
00:34:06,847 --> 00:34:11,616
My mother and sister were victims
of the animals out there. Not me.

340
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:16,227
I get that, Kate. But it doesn't mean
you have to be alone.

341
00:34:40,113 --> 00:34:42,592
You made a big mistake coming here.

342
00:34:50,957 --> 00:34:55,134
I was trained to never make mistakes.
Just like you.

343
00:35:05,406 --> 00:35:10,011
Don't fight it, Damian.
I've had the flaws bred out of me.

344
00:35:10,711 --> 00:35:14,619
But you... you're just a boy.

345
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:20,125
What was it like growing up with him?

346
00:35:22,188 --> 00:35:27,478
When I was a kid, I idolized him.
Hell... I wanted to be him.

347
00:35:27,578 --> 00:35:31,831
But the older I got, the more I realized
that I didn't know him at all.

348
00:35:31,931 --> 00:35:36,570
How could I? Bruce Wayne
is as much a mask as Batman.

349
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:39,891
And I think the only thing
behind those masks is pain.

350
00:35:40,641 --> 00:35:43,544
A pain he refuses to share with anyone.

351
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:46,792
So what was it like?

352
00:35:47,447 --> 00:35:49,587
Lonely.

353
00:36:42,085 --> 00:36:44,872
- It's Alfred.
- Your butler is a part of this, too?

354
00:36:44,972 --> 00:36:47,441
Trust me, he's a total badass. Yeah?

355
00:36:47,541 --> 00:36:50,925
<i>Master Damian is gone, sir.</i>

356
00:37:22,341 --> 00:37:23,918
Where am I?

357
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:31,594
- What the hell are you doing?
- Unfortunately...

358
00:37:31,694 --> 00:37:34,747
I have no more choice in this than you do.

359
00:37:39,325 --> 00:37:41,532
Who are you?

360
00:37:45,615 --> 00:37:48,180
I'm you, Damian...

361
00:37:49,419 --> 00:37:51,439
all grown up.

362
00:37:51,539 --> 00:37:54,408
You're not me. You can't be.

363
00:37:54,508 --> 00:37:57,177
I'm the product of a program that your...

364
00:37:57,277 --> 00:38:00,347
our grandfather initiated.

365
00:38:00,447 --> 00:38:03,263
He wanted to create the perfect soldier.

366
00:38:03,533 --> 00:38:08,088
They used your DNA and put it
through a process of accelerated growth.

367
00:38:08,188 --> 00:38:10,890
Most of the prototypes died quickly.

368
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:12,760
But I survived.

369
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:16,196
I was the strongest of them all.

370
00:38:16,396 --> 00:38:17,631
Still...

371
00:38:17,731 --> 00:38:22,670
I was an empty shell, till Mr. Tetch here
brought me to full consciousness.

372
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:28,538
And as good a job as he did,
there's always been something missing.

373
00:38:28,638 --> 00:38:30,310
A void.

374
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:33,529
And I'm going to fill that void...

375
00:38:33,629 --> 00:38:35,732
with you.

376
00:38:35,982 --> 00:38:38,385
Everything in there...

377
00:38:38,485 --> 00:38:41,087
is going in here.

378
00:38:41,187 --> 00:38:43,457
You, brother...

379
00:38:43,557 --> 00:38:46,589
will provide me with a soul.

380
00:38:46,689 --> 00:38:48,785
The hell, I am.

381
00:38:53,165 --> 00:38:56,303
I don't understand why she just
doesn't grow another one of you.

382
00:38:56,403 --> 00:38:59,927
- She's got a freezer full...
- Are you insane?

383
00:39:01,808 --> 00:39:03,881
Mother.

384
00:39:10,583 --> 00:39:12,319
How dare you!

385
00:39:12,419 --> 00:39:16,123
It wasn't my idea.
This lunatic said he'd kill me if I...

386
00:39:16,223 --> 00:39:19,264
Shut up! You'll suffer for this.

387
00:39:21,027 --> 00:39:24,064
My entire life I've been suffering!

388
00:39:24,164 --> 00:39:27,785
Tell me, what is a man without memories?

389
00:39:28,135 --> 00:39:32,473
I want to know you,
and love you, as he does.

390
00:39:32,673 --> 00:39:37,048
I want to feel you in my heart.
In my blood.

391
00:39:38,477 --> 00:39:43,357
I've always served you without question.
I've never asked anything of you.

392
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:48,704
Please, let me have this.

393
00:39:51,057 --> 00:39:53,393
You poor tormented creature,

394
00:39:53,493 --> 00:39:56,797
how could I not have felt
the depths of your pain?

395
00:39:57,297 --> 00:40:00,788
How could a mother have left
her child so alone...

396
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,341
in the dark.

397
00:40:08,775 --> 00:40:10,894
How could you just kill him
like that? He was...

398
00:40:10,994 --> 00:40:12,800
He was flawed.

399
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:15,379
What about me, am I flawed, too?

400
00:40:15,479 --> 00:40:17,317
Remove all memories of this incident

401
00:40:17,417 --> 00:40:19,720
and then make the other
necessary adjustments.

402
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:22,890
- Adjustments?
- You're of no use to me like this.

403
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:25,627
Recalcitrant, emotional.

404
00:40:26,359 --> 00:40:28,629
Your father's influence, no doubt.

405
00:40:28,729 --> 00:40:31,869
Onyx, get this trash out of here.

406
00:40:35,848 --> 00:40:39,373
Good thing Alfred had the foresight
to put a tracker on the kid's uniform.

407
00:40:39,473 --> 00:40:41,742
The sisters of perpetual grace.

408
00:40:41,842 --> 00:40:44,745
A respected religious order
with missions across the world.

409
00:40:44,845 --> 00:40:47,793
Perfect front for criminal scumbags.

410
00:41:11,354 --> 00:41:13,109
This isn't gonna be easy.

411
00:41:16,108 --> 00:41:19,245
Nuns with M60s and katanas?

412
00:41:19,345 --> 00:41:22,019
That would make them nunjas.

413
00:41:41,433 --> 00:41:44,842
Kind of hate I let you talk me
into using rubber bullets.

414
00:41:59,719 --> 00:42:02,343
Looks like you could use a little help.

415
00:42:06,025 --> 00:42:08,762
- Hello, nurse.
- Luke?

416
00:42:08,862 --> 00:42:12,329
You want a megaphone to announce that?
Call me Batwing.

417
00:42:14,934 --> 00:42:17,937
Batwing? That's original.

418
00:42:19,639 --> 00:42:22,347
Can't say I'm not glad to see you.

419
00:42:46,666 --> 00:42:49,569
It's the bats. Three of them!

420
00:42:49,769 --> 00:42:51,671
Three?

421
00:42:52,071 --> 00:42:55,146
- We retreat.
- Why?

422
00:42:56,158 --> 00:42:57,811
The compound is expendable.

423
00:42:57,911 --> 00:43:01,913
We have more urgent matters
to attend to. Come.

424
00:43:16,896 --> 00:43:19,937
Kill him! Kill him!

425
00:44:08,615 --> 00:44:11,635
It's me, it's your son.

426
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:15,326
Come on, Father.

427
00:44:23,129 --> 00:44:26,670
Batman, we need you.

428
00:44:44,717 --> 00:44:47,157
Can you blow those doors?

429
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:53,030
- God's not going to like this.
- I don't think she's been here for a while.

430
00:45:14,915 --> 00:45:17,124
This way!

431
00:45:46,779 --> 00:45:49,186
Come on, Father.

432
00:45:53,853 --> 00:45:55,029
How are you?

433
00:45:55,129 --> 00:45:59,163
In one piece, which is more
than I can say for this place.

434
00:47:20,099 --> 00:47:21,697
No.

435
00:47:37,590 --> 00:47:39,926
Thanks for saving our butts
back there, Luke.

436
00:47:40,026 --> 00:47:42,662
Yeah, too bad they got away.

437
00:47:42,762 --> 00:47:46,299
Well, Dad always wanted me
to work with Bruce Wayne.

438
00:47:46,399 --> 00:47:49,062
I'm proud to be a part of your team.

439
00:47:49,902 --> 00:47:52,905
We can handle this on our own.

440
00:47:53,005 --> 00:47:56,880
Nightwing, Robin, back to Gotham.

441
00:47:58,567 --> 00:48:00,599
You're welcome.

442
00:48:09,021 --> 00:48:12,492
You really should be resting.
The summit's tomorrow.

443
00:48:12,692 --> 00:48:15,632
It's been a week, I'm fine.

444
00:48:15,778 --> 00:48:18,614
Like father, like son.

445
00:48:18,964 --> 00:48:23,804
All things considered, Master Bruce,
you're in surprisingly good condition.

446
00:48:24,004 --> 00:48:26,806
She treated you... treated us...

447
00:48:26,906 --> 00:48:30,010
like we were machines
that she could just program.

448
00:48:30,110 --> 00:48:31,845
That's all we were to her.

449
00:48:31,945 --> 00:48:34,748
After Bruce Wayne completes
his hosting duties at the summit,

450
00:48:34,848 --> 00:48:36,633
we'll gather any leads we can to find her.

451
00:48:36,733 --> 00:48:40,036
Why wait? I'll call in Kate
and Luke and then...

452
00:48:40,136 --> 00:48:43,320
No. You shouldn't have involved them
in the first place.

453
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:47,327
- Batwing pretty much involved himself.
- And Batwoman?

454
00:48:47,427 --> 00:48:50,467
Did she force you to reveal our secrets?

455
00:48:51,730 --> 00:48:53,466
You weren't here, sir.

456
00:48:53,566 --> 00:48:56,403
Master Dick made a judgment call,

457
00:48:56,503 --> 00:48:59,276
and I think it was the right one.

458
00:48:59,738 --> 00:49:02,409
Maybe so, but from here on...

459
00:49:02,509 --> 00:49:04,815
it's only family.

460
00:49:05,461 --> 00:49:08,128
Kate's going through the hard drive
we pulled from the convent.

461
00:49:08,228 --> 00:49:10,862
- Fine, but when she's done, that's it.
- But we have to...

462
00:49:10,962 --> 00:49:15,815
You're not Batman anymore, Dick!
I call the shots around here.

463
00:49:19,458 --> 00:49:23,196
He's been through an extraordinary
ordeal, Master Dick.

464
00:49:23,296 --> 00:49:26,640
Yeah? Well, so have we.

465
00:49:27,033 --> 00:49:29,587
<i>As the summit kicks off today,
politicians and dignitaries</i>

466
00:49:29,687 --> 00:49:31,863
<i>from more than 20 nations
converge on Gotham,</i>

467
00:49:31,963 --> 00:49:35,775
<i>for what promises to be a pivotal look
at how technology will shape our future.</i>

468
00:49:35,875 --> 00:49:39,807
<i>Minutes ago, Bruce Wayne arrived to deliver
the keynote address that will kick off</i>

469
00:49:39,907 --> 00:49:43,600
<i>the conference and also unveil
ground-breaking technological advances.</i>

470
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:48,475
<i>Up next, researchers discover
mysterious findings on Mars...</i>

471
00:49:50,556 --> 00:49:52,697
What do you mean he doesn't want my help?

472
00:49:53,994 --> 00:49:58,731
He says he's grateful for everything
you've done, Kate, but he just feels that...

473
00:49:58,831 --> 00:50:01,271
Oh, hell, you know what he's like.

474
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:08,535
He just wants to keep it in the family.

475
00:50:09,042 --> 00:50:11,744
I thought you wanted me
to be part of the family.

476
00:50:11,844 --> 00:50:14,381
Yeah, what do I know?

477
00:50:14,581 --> 00:50:19,223
- <i>Find anything on that hard drive, yet?</i>
- No, I gave it to Batwing.

478
00:50:19,718 --> 00:50:22,620
I figured his father's tech could help us.

479
00:50:23,655 --> 00:50:26,058
<i>I'm sorry about this, Kate.</i>

480
00:50:26,158 --> 00:50:29,159
- If it were up to me...
- Nothing to be sorry about.

481
00:50:29,259 --> 00:50:31,601
Goodbye, Dick.

482
00:50:43,175 --> 00:50:45,112
Dad!

483
00:51:19,244 --> 00:51:22,916
<i>As the co-chair of Wayne Enterprises,</i>

484
00:51:23,016 --> 00:51:27,160
<i>it is my profound privilege
to present our host.</i>

485
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:30,907
<i>A man of fellowship, a man of kindness,</i>

486
00:51:31,007 --> 00:51:33,010
<i>a man of peace.</i>

487
00:51:33,310 --> 00:51:36,383
<i>Mr. Bruce Wayne.</i>

488
00:51:54,379 --> 00:51:57,154
Soon, we'll be through
the looking glass, gentlemen.

489
00:51:58,483 --> 00:52:00,420
<i>You're all wearing beta versions
of Wayne Tech's</i>

490
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:02,555
<i>latest breakthrough in communications.</i>

491
00:52:02,655 --> 00:52:07,697
<i>With these translators, we hope to build
bridges between language and culture.</i>

492
00:52:11,507 --> 00:52:14,434
What? We're about to take over the world.

493
00:52:14,534 --> 00:52:17,336
Can't a man dress for the occasion?

494
00:52:17,436 --> 00:52:19,410
Idiot!

495
00:52:20,906 --> 00:52:22,325
Walrus.

496
00:52:22,425 --> 00:52:24,444
<i>The world has become
a more dangerous place.</i>

497
00:52:24,544 --> 00:52:26,660
<i>To meet these threats,
Wayne Tech and S.T.A.R. Labs</i>

498
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:28,555
<i>have developed the watchtower initiative.</i>

499
00:52:28,915 --> 00:52:32,560
<i>Prepare to embark
on the greatest adventure.</i>

500
00:53:33,511 --> 00:53:37,583
Dad doesn't even remember doing it.
He was programmed.

501
00:53:37,683 --> 00:53:40,987
- But why?
- Somehow, they knew I had that drive.

502
00:53:41,087 --> 00:53:44,591
Like they knew about the vault
at Wayne Enterprises.

503
00:53:44,691 --> 00:53:46,926
- Bruce told them.
- Not my father.

504
00:53:47,026 --> 00:53:50,274
Talia had him in there for weeks
and he suddenly snaps out of it

505
00:53:50,374 --> 00:53:52,332
just because we show up?

506
00:53:52,432 --> 00:53:55,168
No, you're wrong. He's fine.

507
00:53:55,268 --> 00:53:59,004
No, he's not. He's not fine.

508
00:53:59,104 --> 00:54:01,240
She got to him.

509
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:04,715
- She's not finished, is she?
- She's just getting started.

510
00:54:07,546 --> 00:54:10,320
Found this on the hard drive.

511
00:54:10,916 --> 00:54:13,453
There are vice-presidents on this list.

512
00:54:13,553 --> 00:54:16,753
Military and corporate leaders,
the vice-chancellor of Germany.

513
00:54:16,853 --> 00:54:18,431
So, why would Talia have this?

514
00:54:18,531 --> 00:54:22,562
What if Talia got to the men and women
on that list, brainwashed them?

515
00:54:22,812 --> 00:54:26,351
Then that would place the League
of Shadows' influence in every country.

516
00:54:26,451 --> 00:54:28,588
She'd control the world.

517
00:54:28,688 --> 00:54:31,625
My God, kid, your mom's got game.

518
00:54:32,125 --> 00:54:35,228
And all the leaders she would need
are at the summit...

519
00:54:35,328 --> 00:54:37,806
along with Bruce Wayne.

520
00:54:49,708 --> 00:54:51,515
Master...

521
00:54:57,149 --> 00:55:00,190
- Status?
- Just a second.

522
00:55:01,386 --> 00:55:03,822
Activating power boost.

523
00:55:03,922 --> 00:55:05,925
You're on, Tetch.

524
00:55:06,225 --> 00:55:09,040
Beginning brain wave synchronization.

525
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:12,799
<i>So many minds. So little time.</i>

526
00:55:12,899 --> 00:55:15,034
And a new age dawns.

527
00:55:15,134 --> 00:55:18,442
Even Ra's Al Ghul couldn't achieve this.

528
00:55:21,439 --> 00:55:25,544
<i>Hey, Batwing, need a ride in the...
Batwing?</i>

529
00:55:25,644 --> 00:55:27,667
<i>Very funny.</i>

530
00:55:28,463 --> 00:55:29,983
You sure they won't know we're coming?

531
00:55:30,083 --> 00:55:32,719
<i>Not once we jam their radar
and shut down the alarm system.</i>

532
00:55:32,919 --> 00:55:34,837
Good thing you got us those schematics.

533
00:55:35,137 --> 00:55:38,612
<i>Hope my dad understands
when he finds out I hacked his computer.</i>

534
00:55:39,958 --> 00:55:43,057
- Got 'em.
- Engaging auto-pilot.

535
00:56:11,289 --> 00:56:14,249
Heads up, looks like we've got company.

536
00:56:19,598 --> 00:56:21,667
How long, Kuttler?

537
00:56:21,767 --> 00:56:25,604
- Twenty minutes at most.
- Make it 10.

538
00:56:25,704 --> 00:56:27,707
Get it.

539
00:56:27,807 --> 00:56:30,113
I brought you a little something.

540
00:56:41,486 --> 00:56:43,756
We've got to find the dignitaries
and evacuate them.

541
00:56:44,056 --> 00:56:45,124
What about Father?

542
00:56:45,224 --> 00:56:47,593
Our first priority is getting
those people out.

543
00:56:47,693 --> 00:56:49,533
Not mine.

544
00:57:02,474 --> 00:57:06,983
We don't have time for this, Damian.
Join us or die.

545
00:57:09,147 --> 00:57:10,454
Father.

546
00:57:30,535 --> 00:57:34,374
<i>The League of Shadows
compels you to be one with us.</i>

547
00:57:34,574 --> 00:57:36,843
<i>There is no you.</i>

548
00:57:36,943 --> 00:57:40,685
<i>You have no home. You have no people.</i>

549
00:59:32,157 --> 00:59:33,567
That can't be good.

550
00:59:46,271 --> 00:59:50,209
<i>You are the League of Shadows
and it is your home.</i>

551
00:59:50,309 --> 00:59:54,380
- <i>We are your people.</i>
- About time you came back.

552
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:56,519
Indeed.

553
01:00:04,828 --> 01:00:06,284
Come on!

554
01:00:08,261 --> 01:00:09,503
No!

555
01:00:14,399 --> 01:00:16,386
Justice!

556
01:00:16,486 --> 01:00:18,775
Not vengeance.

557
01:00:26,278 --> 01:00:27,913
Damn.

558
01:00:28,013 --> 01:00:29,849
<i>Batwing to Robin.</i>

559
01:00:29,949 --> 01:00:32,188
Got a situation here.

560
01:00:32,999 --> 01:00:37,314
I need you to manually transfer power from
the damaged thruster to the remaining two.

561
01:00:39,324 --> 01:00:41,992
Oh, crap! Dad's gonna kill me.

562
01:00:52,888 --> 01:00:54,966
Big dirty...

563
01:01:35,714 --> 01:01:39,289
- <i>The League of Shadows...</i>
- Shut it down.

564
01:02:10,666 --> 01:02:12,943
Bloody hell.

565
01:02:38,743 --> 01:02:42,609
<i>Cutting it kinda close! Hurry up, kid!</i>

566
01:03:33,364 --> 01:03:37,759
Well done, beloved.
We will at least have this victory.

567
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:43,866
Finish him.

568
01:03:47,346 --> 01:03:50,940
Bruce! Don't.

569
01:03:51,083 --> 01:03:54,784
That's what it's all about in the end,
isn't it, Mother?

570
01:03:54,954 --> 01:03:58,124
Not the vision of a better world
my grandfather had.

571
01:03:58,224 --> 01:03:59,959
It's just about control.

572
01:04:00,259 --> 01:04:03,729
Start with the bastard.
We can always make more.

573
01:04:03,829 --> 01:04:05,706
Bruce...

574
01:04:05,806 --> 01:04:09,639
you don't kill. You've never killed.

575
01:04:10,169 --> 01:04:14,440
Don't let her win.
Don't let her take your soul.

576
01:04:14,540 --> 01:04:18,744
If anything, I have cleansed it.
I washed away his trauma.

577
01:04:19,644 --> 01:04:21,951
Finish them.

578
01:04:22,547 --> 01:04:26,052
You brought us all together
because you understood our pain...

579
01:04:26,152 --> 01:04:28,988
our loneliness better
than anyone else could.

580
01:04:29,088 --> 01:04:33,390
We needed family. We needed you.

581
01:04:34,993 --> 01:04:40,404
- Shoot him!
- You're not just a mask. You're a man.

582
01:04:46,804 --> 01:04:49,320
The best man I've ever known.

583
01:04:52,144 --> 01:04:54,697
- No!
- Can't fight it.

584
01:04:54,797 --> 01:05:00,239
Yes, you can, damn it! For the little boy
who lost his world in that alley.

585
01:05:00,652 --> 01:05:02,679
Enough!

586
01:05:12,397 --> 01:05:14,465
I'm sorry.

587
01:05:14,565 --> 01:05:16,718
I'm so sorry.

588
01:05:18,119 --> 01:05:20,160
It's all right, Father.

589
01:05:24,869 --> 01:05:27,184
That's for what you did
to my father, bitch!

590
01:05:30,415 --> 01:05:32,284
It's over, Mother.

591
01:05:32,384 --> 01:05:34,854
Your grand plan has ended.

592
01:05:34,954 --> 01:05:37,156
How is it I ever loved either of you?

593
01:05:37,256 --> 01:05:42,244
- I don't think you ever did.
- Oh, beloved, you have no idea.

594
01:05:42,344 --> 01:05:46,292
I have thought of little else
for the last 12 years.

595
01:05:46,632 --> 01:05:49,919
But nothing, not my passion,

596
01:05:50,019 --> 01:05:52,238
not the death of my father,

597
01:05:52,338 --> 01:05:55,674
not even our child
could bring you to my side.

598
01:05:55,774 --> 01:06:00,546
I know now,
I will never have you in this life.

599
01:06:00,646 --> 01:06:03,917
- But perhaps, in death.
- Get her!

600
01:06:19,747 --> 01:06:21,888
She played us again.

601
01:07:02,573 --> 01:07:04,473
From what Nightwing said,

602
01:07:04,573 --> 01:07:07,379
once the programming is broken,
it can't be reset.

603
01:07:07,479 --> 01:07:11,450
Not yours, not anybody's.

604
01:07:11,550 --> 01:07:14,558
Well, I suppose Tetch could've done it,
if he hadn't lost his head.

605
01:07:16,787 --> 01:07:18,957
I'm proud of you, Kate.

606
01:07:19,057 --> 01:07:22,415
Gabrielle and Elizabeth
would be proud, too.

607
01:07:23,094 --> 01:07:25,235
I hope so.

608
01:07:28,499 --> 01:07:31,636
I'm a... a little early.

609
01:07:31,736 --> 01:07:35,445
No, no. You're right on time.

610
01:07:52,223 --> 01:07:54,639
I'm heading to the tower.

611
01:07:55,493 --> 01:07:58,201
Thanks for lunch, Alfred.

612
01:07:59,897 --> 01:08:01,934
- What's going on?
- Master Bruce is having

613
01:08:02,034 --> 01:08:04,570
a heart-to-heart with Damian.

614
01:08:04,670 --> 01:08:06,852
One can't help feeling bad.

615
01:08:06,952 --> 01:08:11,696
Despite her madness, she was his mother.

616
