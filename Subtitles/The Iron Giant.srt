2
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:17,956
Mayday! Mayday!

3
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:21,926
This is the Annabelle. I've lost my
bearings! I'm taking on water.

4
00:01:22,131 --> 00:01:26,830
My last good reading is
44 degrees north, 68 degrees....

5
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:33,642
Portland Station to Annabelle.
What is your position?

6
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:38,143
I don't know exactly. Off the coast
somewhere near Rockwell! Wait.

7
00:01:38,714 --> 00:01:40,648
The lighthouse! I see it!

8
00:03:01,498 --> 00:03:03,022
Over here, honey!

9
00:03:05,802 --> 00:03:09,602
Hey, Mom! You won't believe our 
good luck. Guess what I found?

10
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,277
Hogarth, we've been
through this before. No pets.

11
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:16,241
But he's not a pet, Mom.
He's a friend.

12
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:19,540
We've got to rent a room
if we're gonna make ends meet...

13
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,718
...and no one wants
shredded upholstery.

14
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:24,046
You won't know he's there.
I'll cage him.

15
00:03:24,254 --> 00:03:28,021
Until you feel sorry for him
and set him free in the house!

16
00:03:28,225 --> 00:03:30,352
Do you remember the raccoon, Hogarth?

17
00:03:31,428 --> 00:03:32,827
I remember the raccoon.

18
00:03:33,029 --> 00:03:35,760
Please, Mom, at least look at him.

19
00:03:36,867 --> 00:03:39,665
All right. Where is this guy?

20
00:03:39,871 --> 00:03:41,963
I can't read this handwriting.

21
00:03:42,172 --> 00:03:45,141
That one should have lettuce,
tomato, extra mayo.

22
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,108
I will go get him, okay?

23
00:03:50,046 --> 00:03:52,777
So he wants us to hold the mayo
and the mustard.

24
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:55,646
How about just hold
the flavor altogether?

25
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:03,021
Excuse me.

26
00:04:03,226 --> 00:04:07,060
Excuse me. Sir?

27
00:04:10,134 --> 00:04:11,464
Excuse me--!

28
00:04:15,373 --> 00:04:17,170
- What's that?
- Please don't move.

29
00:04:17,408 --> 00:04:20,343
My pet's under your table.
Don't look!

30
00:04:20,545 --> 00:04:23,139
If you make a scene,
my mom won't let me keep him.

31
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:25,440
- What kind of pet, kid?
- A squirrel.

32
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:26,708
He's friendly.

33
00:04:26,918 --> 00:04:31,322
I'm telling the truth, dang it!
It came from outer space. I saw it.

34
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:34,356
And it was headed toward land.

35
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,858
I called the government
in Washington about it.

36
00:04:37,162 --> 00:04:40,598
Maybe it was a Sputnik
or an invader from Mars.

37
00:04:40,832 --> 00:04:42,094
That's what it is.

38
00:04:42,301 --> 00:04:44,133
It's an invader from Mars!

39
00:04:44,337 --> 00:04:47,499
A spaceship of some kind.
An unidentified flying object.

40
00:04:47,706 --> 00:04:52,110
Unidentified? Knowing you, Earl,
I'd say it was either whiskey or beer.

41
00:04:58,016 --> 00:04:59,415
I saw it too.

42
00:05:01,621 --> 00:05:03,486
I rest my case.

43
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,252
I believe you.

44
00:05:09,562 --> 00:05:10,790
What if it is Sputnik?

45
00:05:11,397 --> 00:05:12,694
Or a flying saucer...

46
00:05:12,898 --> 00:05:14,196
...from Mars?

47
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,867
I bet we could find it.

48
00:05:16,369 --> 00:05:19,064
Sorry, kid.
I didn't really see anything.

49
00:05:19,272 --> 00:05:21,672
But if we don't stick up
for the kooks, who will?

50
00:05:21,874 --> 00:05:23,809
Is my son bothering you, sir?

51
00:05:27,146 --> 00:05:30,013
No! Call me Dean.

52
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:33,510
Hogarth, you were going
to get your pet, honey?

53
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,708
I will, Mom.

54
00:05:34,921 --> 00:05:37,480
- Right after I finish talking with--
- Dean.

55
00:05:40,793 --> 00:05:42,522
- Found your pet.
- Where?

56
00:05:42,729 --> 00:05:46,597
Squirrel's up my pants, Hogarth.
I'm trying not to wig out here.

57
00:05:46,799 --> 00:05:47,857
Don't wig out.

58
00:05:48,067 --> 00:05:50,558
Okay. He's heading north now.

59
00:05:51,271 --> 00:05:55,901
I'm sorry, kid. I'd like to apologize
to everyone in advance for this.

60
00:06:06,654 --> 00:06:08,212
Check, please.

61
00:06:08,689 --> 00:06:10,486
It's a rat!

62
00:06:15,796 --> 00:06:18,890
Hello, this is Hogarth Hughes speaking.
Who's calling?

63
00:06:19,099 --> 00:06:20,964
I'm really sorry, but--

64
00:06:21,168 --> 00:06:22,260
Thank you.

65
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:25,905
I need to work late tonight.
There's cold chicken in the icebox.

66
00:06:26,107 --> 00:06:28,575
You can have that and some carrots--

67
00:06:28,777 --> 00:06:30,540
I'm way ahead of you, Mom.

68
00:06:30,811 --> 00:06:33,143
I'll make it up to you, okay?

69
00:06:33,381 --> 00:06:34,712
- I love you, honey.
- Me too.

70
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:35,780
And, Hogarth...

71
00:06:35,984 --> 00:06:39,784
...no scary movies, no late snacks,
in bed by 8:00. Got it?

72
00:06:39,988 --> 00:06:42,388
Come on, Mom. It's me, remember?

73
00:06:42,624 --> 00:06:46,754
Why, the porpoise can communicate
telepathically, Miss Melon.

74
00:06:46,962 --> 00:06:50,523
If we can transplant at least 15%
of their brain matter into ours...

75
00:06:50,732 --> 00:06:53,428
...we may be able to read minds.

76
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:58,467
Darn. A perfectly good brain wasted.

77
00:06:58,673 --> 00:07:01,403
I think you've seen enough.
How about a nightcap?

78
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:03,940
Let's say my place.

79
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,313
I was thinking the same thing.
Mind reader.

80
00:07:08,516 --> 00:07:12,145
Darn. I seem to have left
my keys in the lab.

81
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:23,259
You're gonna get it.

82
00:07:32,107 --> 00:07:33,198
Who's there?

83
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:50,216
Come on!

84
00:07:50,425 --> 00:07:52,189
Stupid antenna.

85
00:08:27,764 --> 00:08:30,460
Invaders from Mars!

86
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,119
Honey?

87
00:13:37,013 --> 00:13:39,038
Help! Help! Stop! Help!

88
00:13:48,524 --> 00:13:51,925
Don't you know better
than to wander off at night alone?

89
00:13:52,128 --> 00:13:53,527
What if something happened?

90
00:13:53,729 --> 00:13:55,560
I'm sorry, Mom.

91
00:13:55,765 --> 00:13:58,325
Don't you ever do that to me again.

92
00:13:58,534 --> 00:14:02,402
I was so scared.
I thought I'd lost you.

93
00:14:03,572 --> 00:14:07,872
You won't believe this.
Something ate our TV antenna.

94
00:14:11,014 --> 00:14:13,073
No! I'm serious!

95
00:14:13,283 --> 00:14:15,581
But it's not Sputnik,
like Mr. Stutz thought.

96
00:14:15,786 --> 00:14:19,085
No, it's a robot!
No, really, it is!

97
00:14:19,723 --> 00:14:23,659
And the robot, it's 100 feet high!
And it eats metal!

98
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,987
Stop it! Just...

99
00:14:26,496 --> 00:14:28,054
...stop.

100
00:14:28,265 --> 00:14:29,596
I'm not--

101
00:14:31,401 --> 00:14:32,993
I'm not in the mood.

102
00:14:35,005 --> 00:14:37,565
Come on. Let's go home.

103
00:14:54,591 --> 00:14:57,617
A peaceful, stay-at-home kind of day
in a town...

104
00:14:57,828 --> 00:14:59,261
...very much like your own.

105
00:14:59,463 --> 00:15:00,589
But then, suddenly...

106
00:15:00,797 --> 00:15:02,322
...without warning...

107
00:15:03,134 --> 00:15:05,762
...atomic holocaust!

108
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:08,438
But how does one survive
an atomic attack?

109
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,539
Did you hear about crazy Mr. Stutz?

110
00:15:10,741 --> 00:15:12,868
He says his boat
ran into a sea monster.

111
00:15:13,077 --> 00:15:15,477
I heard it was sunk by a meteor.

112
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,138
It was a metal meteor.
It ate his boat. My dad says--

113
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:20,578
It wasn't any of those.

114
00:15:20,785 --> 00:15:23,879
What would you know about it,
Poindexter?

115
00:15:24,222 --> 00:15:26,315
Don't make me come over there.

116
00:15:26,524 --> 00:15:29,220
Hands over your head
Keep low to the ground

117
00:15:29,427 --> 00:15:32,191
Time to duck and cover
The bombs are coming down

118
00:15:32,497 --> 00:15:33,555
Duck and cover

119
00:15:34,866 --> 00:15:38,734
It's about 50 or 60 feet high
and it only eats metal.

120
00:15:38,936 --> 00:15:40,426
Shut up, you little spaz!

121
00:15:40,638 --> 00:15:43,903
It's probably been sent by
foreigners to take over the country.

122
00:15:44,108 --> 00:15:46,770
We should bomb it to smithereens
before it does.

123
00:15:46,978 --> 00:15:50,073
'Cause all the kids who don't
Will cease to be around

124
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:51,839
Thanks for the scrap, Floyd.

125
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:55,247
Sorry I can't pay you more.
But it's got this...

126
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:58,420
...this large bite out of it.

127
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:02,651
That's why I'm selling it.
It's got a large bite out of it.

128
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:05,887
- What could've done this?
- I told you what.

129
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:10,525
Strange invaders.

130
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:14,399
Thanks for believing me.
I really did call the government.

131
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:17,598
They're sending someone
to take care of the whole thing.

132
00:16:17,809 --> 00:16:20,277
Jeez, Earl. You really are crazy.

133
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,845
Who in the hell would
the government send?

134
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:28,649
Kent Mansley,
Unexplained Phenomena.

135
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:30,617
- Marv Loach. I--
- What happened?

136
00:16:30,822 --> 00:16:34,883
Not sure. Sometimes the line'll snap
if the weather is bad, sure.

137
00:16:35,093 --> 00:16:38,790
But for a whole tower to get
twisted up like that....

138
00:16:39,998 --> 00:16:41,124
It's got me beat.

139
00:16:41,466 --> 00:16:46,302
It's almost like it was bitten off
by some enormous beast.

140
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:48,440
Enormous beast.

141
00:16:49,242 --> 00:16:50,971
What do you think?
Escaped gorilla?

142
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:52,542
What department is that again?

143
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:56,545
I'm not at liberty to reveal the
particulars of the agency I work for...

144
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:58,376
...and all that that implies.

145
00:16:58,585 --> 00:17:00,849
You mean national security?

146
00:17:01,054 --> 00:17:02,578
Let's put it this way.

147
00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:04,722
Once in a while, things happen...

148
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:07,653
...that can't be rationalized
in a conventional way.

149
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,419
People wanna know that
their government has a response.

150
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:13,063
I am that response.

151
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:15,291
So were there any witnesses?

152
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,333
Well, sir, if you'll just follow me.

153
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:21,297
We did find this.

154
00:17:22,842 --> 00:17:25,437
United States Government, huh?

155
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:28,410
Guess that means something big's
happening here, eh?

156
00:17:28,615 --> 00:17:32,450
No, Marv. Big things happen
in big places.

157
00:17:32,653 --> 00:17:36,588
The sooner I fill out my report,
the sooner I can get back to them.

158
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:39,317
Enormous beast, yeah....

159
00:17:41,662 --> 00:17:44,130
Biggest thing here is probably
the homecoming queen.

160
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:45,662
Oh, my God!

161
00:17:51,505 --> 00:17:52,971
Come on, I need a witness.

162
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:55,641
- It's around the corner.
- Don't pull so hard.

163
00:17:55,843 --> 00:17:58,470
It's like a big "chomp"
out of the side of the car.

164
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:01,170
It's like a bite
out of a ham sandwich, like a--

165
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:08,914
What are we looking at here,
Mr. Manley?

166
00:18:09,323 --> 00:18:11,290
Something big, Marv.

167
00:18:13,326 --> 00:18:15,227
Something big.

168
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,232
Hello!

169
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:26,201
Come out!

170
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:31,603
Hey, big metal guy,
I got food here for you!

171
00:18:32,914 --> 00:18:34,211
Metal!

172
00:18:34,415 --> 00:18:36,509
Crunchy, delicious metal!

173
00:18:36,718 --> 00:18:39,049
Come and get it!

174
00:20:16,552 --> 00:20:20,489
So I guess you're
not gonna hurt me, huh?

175
00:20:27,464 --> 00:20:29,397
The shutoff switch.

176
00:20:31,334 --> 00:20:33,165
You saw me save you.

177
00:20:37,174 --> 00:20:39,301
So where are you from?

178
00:20:41,512 --> 00:20:44,174
You came from the sky, right?

179
00:20:44,648 --> 00:20:46,013
From up there?

180
00:20:46,617 --> 00:20:48,346
Don't you remember anything?

181
00:20:51,222 --> 00:20:55,022
Maybe it's that bump on your head.

182
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,351
Do you talk?

183
00:21:00,731 --> 00:21:04,860
You know, words? "Blah, blah, blah,"
like that? Can you do that?

184
00:21:09,307 --> 00:21:12,400
Well, you get the idea anyway.

185
00:21:12,777 --> 00:21:13,903
Let's see.

186
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:18,412
See this? This is called a rock.

187
00:21:18,983 --> 00:21:20,176
Rock.

188
00:21:22,086 --> 00:21:22,916
Good.

189
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:36,897
That is a tree.

190
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,763
Rock. Tree.

191
00:21:40,204 --> 00:21:41,033
Get it?

192
00:21:44,942 --> 00:21:46,602
That's right!

193
00:21:47,378 --> 00:21:48,936
My own giant robot.

194
00:21:49,213 --> 00:21:52,614
I am now the luckiest kid in America!

195
00:21:52,817 --> 00:21:53,908
This is unbelievable.

196
00:21:54,118 --> 00:21:58,579
This is the greatest discovery since,
I don't know, television or something.

197
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:02,658
I gotta tell someone. I should call--
No, they'll panic.

198
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:05,852
People wig out and shoot when
they see something big like you.

199
00:22:07,366 --> 00:22:10,698
Wig out. It means crazy.
You know, like....

200
00:22:14,439 --> 00:22:16,373
No, no! Don't do that!

201
00:22:16,575 --> 00:22:18,941
That's the stuff
that makes them shoot at you.

202
00:22:19,145 --> 00:22:22,545
Two nights ago, at approximately
1900 hours, sat com radar...

203
00:22:22,748 --> 00:22:26,617
...detected an unidentified object
entering Earth's atmosphere...

204
00:22:26,819 --> 00:22:29,879
...losing contact with it 2 1/2 miles
off the coast of Rockwell.

205
00:22:30,089 --> 00:22:33,058
Some assumed it was a large meteor
or a downed satellite.

206
00:22:33,258 --> 00:22:35,819
But Washington received
a call from someone...

207
00:22:36,029 --> 00:22:38,997
...who reported an actual encounter
with the object.

208
00:22:39,431 --> 00:22:42,424
This is no meteor, gentlemen.

209
00:22:42,635 --> 00:22:45,467
This is something much more serious.

210
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:50,368
We can't call Ripley's Believe It Or Not
because they wouldn't believe it.

211
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:51,771
And....

212
00:22:52,145 --> 00:22:55,238
It's getting dark.
And if I don't get home soon...

213
00:22:55,448 --> 00:22:57,142
...Mom's gonna wonder where I am.

214
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:59,613
If she comes looking for me
and sees you...

215
00:22:59,819 --> 00:23:02,049
...then we got
the screaming problem again.

216
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:05,486
So for now, would you,
you know, just...

217
00:23:05,691 --> 00:23:07,819
...just stay here, okay?

218
00:23:08,026 --> 00:23:09,891
I'll come back tomorrow.

219
00:23:18,204 --> 00:23:19,193
Goodbye.

220
00:23:22,941 --> 00:23:24,034
No, no.

221
00:23:24,343 --> 00:23:25,811
Me go.

222
00:23:26,012 --> 00:23:27,206
You stay.

223
00:23:27,412 --> 00:23:29,176
No following.

224
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:31,339
Good.

225
00:23:33,585 --> 00:23:35,053
I told you!

226
00:23:35,388 --> 00:23:38,846
I'll come back tomorrow!

227
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:41,219
Now, stay!

228
00:23:47,735 --> 00:23:49,464
Bad robot!

229
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:07,546
Look, you can't go stomping around
and you can't come with me.

230
00:24:07,756 --> 00:24:09,656
My mom will wig out.

231
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:12,325
That's right.

232
00:24:12,527 --> 00:24:17,464
So you have got to stay in the forest,
and I'll bring you some food tomorrow.

233
00:24:17,832 --> 00:24:21,597
But I gotta go home now.

234
00:24:22,504 --> 00:24:24,334
So goodbye.

235
00:24:35,083 --> 00:24:36,606
Hey, wait a minute!

236
00:24:36,817 --> 00:24:38,342
What do you think you're doing?

237
00:24:38,553 --> 00:24:40,248
Look at this mess!

238
00:24:48,595 --> 00:24:49,756
Put it back!

239
00:24:49,964 --> 00:24:51,522
Put it back right now!

240
00:24:52,767 --> 00:24:56,032
Help me! I need your help!

241
00:24:58,406 --> 00:24:59,065
Good, good!

242
00:25:05,412 --> 00:25:07,244
Put them together. Like this.

243
00:25:07,449 --> 00:25:09,610
This one here, that one there.

244
00:25:10,384 --> 00:25:13,478
Okay, over, over. Good, good.
Now the other one.

245
00:25:14,722 --> 00:25:15,553
Okay. Good enough.

246
00:25:15,757 --> 00:25:17,054
Let's go!

247
00:25:19,259 --> 00:25:20,090
What the--?

248
00:25:22,264 --> 00:25:25,324
That's fine! Leave it alone!
The train is coming!

249
00:25:25,534 --> 00:25:27,901
The train is coming!

250
00:25:28,471 --> 00:25:29,769
Come on, let's go!

251
00:25:53,296 --> 00:25:54,319
You're alive!

252
00:26:07,344 --> 00:26:10,245
- Anybody out there?
- We're in trouble now.

253
00:26:10,447 --> 00:26:11,641
Are you all right?

254
00:26:11,847 --> 00:26:15,045
I've changed my mind.
You can follow me home. Let's go.

255
00:26:16,452 --> 00:26:17,852
Mayor's office.

256
00:26:18,054 --> 00:26:19,953
What? A train accident?

257
00:26:20,557 --> 00:26:22,286
He hit a giant creature?

258
00:26:22,491 --> 00:26:24,721
What creature could be big enough to--

259
00:26:25,862 --> 00:26:26,988
I need your car.

260
00:27:10,209 --> 00:27:13,234
You can fix yourself? Neat-o!

261
00:27:13,779 --> 00:27:17,339
Mom's home. Just stay here, okay?
I'll be back. Bye!

262
00:27:18,617 --> 00:27:19,742
Bye.

263
00:27:29,194 --> 00:27:30,786
What happened here?

264
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:34,865
Go on. Tell him what you saw, Frank.

265
00:27:36,268 --> 00:27:38,792
You're not gonna believe this.

266
00:27:40,539 --> 00:27:43,735
But it was a giant metal man.

267
00:27:47,812 --> 00:27:50,680
Does anyone know where I can get to
a telephone nearby?

268
00:27:54,886 --> 00:27:56,148
Would you say grace?

269
00:28:02,426 --> 00:28:03,655
Oh, my God!

270
00:28:06,464 --> 00:28:08,296
Oh, my God...

271
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:10,568
...we thank you.

272
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:12,898
For...

273
00:28:13,372 --> 00:28:15,670
...the food that Mom...

274
00:28:15,874 --> 00:28:17,933
...has put in front of us and--
Stop!

275
00:28:19,478 --> 00:28:21,502
The devil...

276
00:28:21,879 --> 00:28:25,372
...from doing bad things and....

277
00:28:25,584 --> 00:28:27,551
Get out of here!

278
00:28:28,987 --> 00:28:30,283
Satan?

279
00:28:30,622 --> 00:28:31,452
Go!

280
00:28:31,822 --> 00:28:33,757
Go, so...

281
00:28:34,326 --> 00:28:36,793
...that we may live in peace. Amen.

282
00:28:36,994 --> 00:28:38,656
Amen.

283
00:28:38,931 --> 00:28:42,424
That was really unusual, Hogarth.

284
00:28:43,202 --> 00:28:44,725
Forgot to wash my hands.

285
00:28:59,218 --> 00:29:00,049
Stop, stop!

286
00:29:01,487 --> 00:29:03,547
All right. Come on. Over here.

287
00:29:21,508 --> 00:29:23,066
Come on, over here. Come on.

288
00:29:25,846 --> 00:29:29,475
Hey there, scout. Kent Mansley.
I work for the government.

289
00:29:35,723 --> 00:29:39,920
Hey there. Kent Mansley. Work for
the government. Your parents home?

290
00:29:40,127 --> 00:29:41,218
We're eating.

291
00:29:42,262 --> 00:29:43,888
Who's there, honey?

292
00:29:44,231 --> 00:29:47,394
Hello there. Do you have
a telephone I could use?

293
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,501
- There's one in the kitchen.
- Thank you.

294
00:29:49,703 --> 00:29:51,033
Thank you very much.

295
00:29:51,271 --> 00:29:52,100
Here.

296
00:29:53,072 --> 00:29:54,904
Pretend you're a gangster.

297
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:58,939
- You call me at home for this?
- You don't understand.

298
00:29:59,879 --> 00:30:01,040
It ate my car.

299
00:30:01,247 --> 00:30:02,737
And you saw this happen?

300
00:30:02,949 --> 00:30:06,612
No, I didn't actually see it.
It went off into the woods.

301
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:09,083
So you don't have any evidence?

302
00:30:09,289 --> 00:30:10,847
But I've got an eyewitness!

303
00:30:11,058 --> 00:30:13,049
An eyewitness with a concussion.

304
00:30:13,994 --> 00:30:15,461
This thing is a menace.

305
00:30:15,662 --> 00:30:19,257
It tore up the power station.
It caused a train wreck!

306
00:30:19,466 --> 00:30:20,296
What did?

307
00:30:20,502 --> 00:30:22,526
Tell me again, Mansley,
and this time...

308
00:30:22,736 --> 00:30:24,898
...listen to yourself.

309
00:30:25,807 --> 00:30:28,104
A giant metal monster.

310
00:30:30,211 --> 00:30:33,112
Please, sir. I've got
a feeling about this one.

311
00:30:33,314 --> 00:30:36,648
That's lovely, Kent. But let me try
to explain how this works.

312
00:30:36,852 --> 00:30:40,379
If you told me you'd found,
say, a giant footprint...

313
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:43,217
...I might send an expert
to make a plaster cast of it.

314
00:30:43,426 --> 00:30:47,089
Get me a photograph
and I could get some troops over there!

315
00:30:47,295 --> 00:30:49,821
But you tell me you've got a feeling...?

316
00:30:50,032 --> 00:30:53,934
All right, fine. You want evidence?
I'll get you evidence.

317
00:30:54,136 --> 00:30:57,003
And when I do, I'm gonna want
a memo distributed.

318
00:30:57,206 --> 00:30:58,195
That sounds swell.

319
00:30:58,407 --> 00:31:01,308
I'll want that memo carbon-copied
and redistributed--

320
00:31:16,225 --> 00:31:18,749
Hi. Thanks for the use of your phone.

321
00:31:19,495 --> 00:31:21,963
Thank you for the use
of your phone, Mrs...?

322
00:31:22,164 --> 00:31:25,395
Hughes. Annie Hughes.
And this is my son, Hogarth.

323
00:31:25,601 --> 00:31:27,694
Thank you, Annie. Hobart.

324
00:31:27,902 --> 00:31:30,098
That's Hogarth!

325
00:31:32,741 --> 00:31:35,903
What an embarrassing name.
Might as well call him Zeppo.

326
00:31:36,111 --> 00:31:39,547
What kind of a sick person
would name a kid Hogar--?

327
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:42,174
Hog Hug.

328
00:31:43,218 --> 00:31:44,049
Hogarth Hughes!

329
00:31:48,991 --> 00:31:51,015
Kent Mansley.
You work for the government.

330
00:31:51,227 --> 00:31:53,457
I wasn't gonna say that.

331
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:55,858
I have something for you, Hogarth.

332
00:31:56,065 --> 00:31:58,363
Your BB gun. Where did you find that?

333
00:31:58,567 --> 00:31:59,864
Up at the power station.

334
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:02,698
- Hogarth was out there the other night.
- Really?

335
00:32:02,906 --> 00:32:05,101
See anything unusual, Hogarth?

336
00:32:05,307 --> 00:32:08,243
Nothing...

337
00:32:08,445 --> 00:32:10,709
...unusual, really.

338
00:32:15,753 --> 00:32:17,219
Gotta use the bathroom.

339
00:32:24,996 --> 00:32:28,659
Strange he's so tightlipped. The other
night he couldn't stop talking.

340
00:32:28,865 --> 00:32:31,391
I mean, 100-foot robots and whatnot.

341
00:32:31,602 --> 00:32:33,501
A hundred-foot robot?

342
00:32:34,037 --> 00:32:35,505
That's nutty!

343
00:32:35,907 --> 00:32:37,101
What else did he say?

344
00:32:37,307 --> 00:32:39,037
No, wait, stop!

345
00:32:40,178 --> 00:32:41,576
Excuse me.

346
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:49,014
What is going on in there?

347
00:32:51,689 --> 00:32:52,986
Are you all right?

348
00:32:53,291 --> 00:32:54,780
I'm fine.

349
00:32:54,991 --> 00:32:58,189
You know, this sort of thing is
why it's so important...

350
00:32:58,395 --> 00:33:00,728
...to really chew your food.

351
00:33:09,239 --> 00:33:10,264
A little privacy?!

352
00:33:10,474 --> 00:33:11,498
Sorry.

353
00:33:11,909 --> 00:33:13,137
Sorry.

354
00:33:13,577 --> 00:33:15,374
He's been acting strange lately.

355
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:16,443
That hurt.

356
00:33:27,592 --> 00:33:29,219
Thank you again, Annie.

357
00:33:31,394 --> 00:33:35,798
Good night, Hogarth. I'm sure
we'll see each other again real soon.

358
00:33:43,075 --> 00:33:44,598
If you're gonna stay here...

359
00:33:44,809 --> 00:33:48,211
...you gotta keep better track
of yourself.

360
00:33:49,514 --> 00:33:54,076
Anyway, I thought you'd like,
you know, a bedtime story or something.

361
00:33:54,286 --> 00:33:57,414
I've got some really cool ones.

362
00:33:57,624 --> 00:34:00,889
Mad Magazine, very funny.

363
00:34:01,594 --> 00:34:03,960
The Spirit, very cool.

364
00:34:04,264 --> 00:34:05,663
Boy's Life ?

365
00:34:05,865 --> 00:34:07,126
Oh, here.

366
00:34:07,366 --> 00:34:10,029
This guy is Superman.

367
00:34:10,369 --> 00:34:12,302
Sure, he's famous now...

368
00:34:12,503 --> 00:34:14,473
...but he started off just like you.

369
00:34:14,674 --> 00:34:18,802
Crash-landed on Earth.
Didn't know what he was doing.

370
00:34:19,011 --> 00:34:22,947
But he only uses his powers for good,
never for evil.

371
00:34:23,715 --> 00:34:25,183
Remember that.

372
00:34:31,424 --> 00:34:33,482
That's Atomo, the metal menace.

373
00:34:33,724 --> 00:34:36,319
He's not the hero. He's the villain.

374
00:34:36,561 --> 00:34:38,290
He's not like you.

375
00:34:38,531 --> 00:34:40,121
You're a good guy.

376
00:34:40,632 --> 00:34:42,224
Like Superman.

377
00:34:42,435 --> 00:34:44,628
Superman.

378
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:50,666
You're hungry, aren't you?

379
00:34:51,377 --> 00:34:53,900
But I don't have any metal here.

380
00:34:54,512 --> 00:34:55,980
Just follow me.

381
00:34:57,850 --> 00:34:59,647
Pick me up, okay?

382
00:35:11,398 --> 00:35:12,989
Okay, now, march!

383
00:35:34,121 --> 00:35:35,985
Oh, yeah. That's Rockwell.

384
00:35:36,322 --> 00:35:37,516
Nice place, huh?

385
00:35:37,724 --> 00:35:38,851
Rockwell?

386
00:35:39,059 --> 00:35:41,551
Yes, I was born right down there.

387
00:35:41,863 --> 00:35:43,591
Rockwell!

388
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,759
No, stop! Look out for the cow!

389
00:35:48,035 --> 00:35:49,502
Come on, no, not there!

390
00:35:49,703 --> 00:35:52,433
Please stop. No, stop!

391
00:35:55,243 --> 00:35:57,073
We can't go there yet.

392
00:35:57,278 --> 00:36:00,042
People just aren't ready for you.

393
00:36:12,359 --> 00:36:13,725
That was close.

394
00:36:13,928 --> 00:36:17,363
We can't go running around
like that, okay?

395
00:36:18,297 --> 00:36:19,230
Look!

396
00:36:22,102 --> 00:36:25,470
I guess that would be okay to eat.
It's been there for months.

397
00:36:28,375 --> 00:36:29,274
We gotta hide!

398
00:36:29,711 --> 00:36:30,939
You know, hide?

399
00:36:31,145 --> 00:36:33,341
It's when you--
You know, when you--

400
00:36:33,547 --> 00:36:35,015
Just get behind something, quick!

401
00:36:39,687 --> 00:36:41,120
Don't move.

402
00:37:08,784 --> 00:37:11,378
Our troubles are over.

403
00:37:16,291 --> 00:37:17,316
This is it.

404
00:37:17,525 --> 00:37:18,992
All you can eat.

405
00:37:33,477 --> 00:37:35,104
Turn it off!

406
00:37:40,684 --> 00:37:42,584
Come on, turn it off!

407
00:37:53,261 --> 00:37:55,356
All right, who's out there?

408
00:37:58,968 --> 00:38:01,403
I know you. Squirrel boy.

409
00:38:02,838 --> 00:38:05,535
By night, known as Hogarth. Got it.

410
00:38:06,343 --> 00:38:09,174
Come on inside, kid.
Sorry about the crowbar.

411
00:38:09,979 --> 00:38:12,972
You'd be surprised how many people
wanna steal scrap.

412
00:38:13,182 --> 00:38:16,812
But, man, once I turn it into art,
I can't give it away.

413
00:38:17,019 --> 00:38:18,213
I mean, what am I?

414
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:22,050
A junkman who sells art
or an artist who sells junk?

415
00:38:22,259 --> 00:38:23,590
You tell me.

416
00:38:23,793 --> 00:38:25,989
I like it, I think.

417
00:38:27,098 --> 00:38:30,931
Listen, you're not gonna call
my mom, are you?

418
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:32,795
She doesn't know I'm out.

419
00:38:33,069 --> 00:38:37,199
Don't worry, kid. It's not my style
to report a guy to the authorities.

420
00:38:38,041 --> 00:38:39,339
I'm gonna have some coffee.

421
00:38:39,543 --> 00:38:43,206
What do you want, some milk,
or what? Milk?

422
00:38:43,413 --> 00:38:44,472
Coffee's fine.

423
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:48,913
I drink it. I'm hip.

424
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:50,212
I don't know.

425
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:53,947
This is espresso, you know?
It's like coffee-zilla.

426
00:38:54,157 --> 00:38:56,454
I said, I'm hip.

427
00:38:59,262 --> 00:39:02,322
She moved me up a grade.
Now I'm even more not fitting in.

428
00:39:02,532 --> 00:39:05,366
I was getting all A's.
My mom says, "You need stimulation."

429
00:39:05,569 --> 00:39:08,869
- I go, "I'm stimulated enough now."
- That's for sure.

430
00:39:09,073 --> 00:39:11,633
"You need a challenge."
So now I'm challenged...

431
00:39:11,843 --> 00:39:15,642
...to keep my lunch money because
of the mooses who wanna pound me...

432
00:39:15,847 --> 00:39:17,676
...since they think
I'm smarter than them.

433
00:39:17,883 --> 00:39:19,874
I don't think I am,
I just do the homework.

434
00:39:20,084 --> 00:39:24,282
If everyone did, they could move up a
grade and get pounded. Any more coffee?

435
00:39:24,488 --> 00:39:27,356
Look, it's really none
of my business, kid...

436
00:39:27,559 --> 00:39:30,528
...but who cares what
these creeps think, you know?

437
00:39:30,729 --> 00:39:33,253
They don't decide who you are.
You do.

438
00:39:33,465 --> 00:39:36,798
You are who you choose to be.

439
00:39:40,504 --> 00:39:42,769
- Did you hear that?
- No, wait. Stop!

440
00:39:54,885 --> 00:39:55,715
It's okay!

441
00:39:56,021 --> 00:39:56,988
My God!

442
00:39:57,189 --> 00:39:59,317
- He isn't gonna--
- Run, kid! Run!

443
00:40:02,962 --> 00:40:05,123
It's okay. He isn't--

444
00:40:05,498 --> 00:40:07,728
It's okay. He isn't gonna hurt me.

445
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,868
Don't squash him!

446
00:40:10,469 --> 00:40:11,902
Do not...

447
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:14,105
...squash him.

448
00:40:15,107 --> 00:40:16,473
His name is Dean.

449
00:40:16,676 --> 00:40:18,473
We like Dean.

450
00:40:22,482 --> 00:40:23,779
So...

451
00:40:24,049 --> 00:40:26,348
...where'd he come from?

452
00:40:26,853 --> 00:40:28,377
He doesn't remember.

453
00:40:28,587 --> 00:40:30,783
He's like a little kid.

454
00:40:31,089 --> 00:40:32,522
Little. Yeah.

455
00:40:33,826 --> 00:40:36,020
Wait a minute. You can talk to him?

456
00:40:36,228 --> 00:40:40,165
He can't say a lot of words yet
but he understands things pretty good.

457
00:40:40,366 --> 00:40:41,831
I see.

458
00:40:46,438 --> 00:40:49,134
He needs food and shelter.

459
00:41:01,053 --> 00:41:03,717
You got plenty of room here.

460
00:41:03,923 --> 00:41:06,358
- This place is perfect.
- Go away.

461
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:10,586
I can have him push the door down.
You know I can.

462
00:41:10,798 --> 00:41:12,526
I can't hide it here.

463
00:41:12,733 --> 00:41:14,597
- "Him," not "it."
- Whatever.

464
00:41:14,802 --> 00:41:19,296
You don't even know where "he"
came from. Or what the hell "he" is!

465
00:41:19,505 --> 00:41:21,269
He's my friend.

466
00:41:22,242 --> 00:41:24,675
Yeah, what am I? Am I your friend?

467
00:41:24,878 --> 00:41:29,075
Bring some Franken-bot with out-of-state
plates, make me change my tune.

468
00:41:29,282 --> 00:41:32,115
I don't like that jazz.
God, I'm tired.

469
00:41:32,318 --> 00:41:34,115
So he can stay?

470
00:41:34,454 --> 00:41:38,585
Tonight. Tomorrow, I don't know.
I don't know about tomorrow.

471
00:41:47,535 --> 00:41:49,263
Sleep tight.

472
00:41:49,536 --> 00:41:51,596
I'll see you tomorrow.

473
00:42:05,652 --> 00:42:07,882
- You're up already?
- Just making the bed.

474
00:42:08,089 --> 00:42:11,252
That's nice. Come downstairs.
I have a surprise for you.

475
00:42:16,497 --> 00:42:18,761
Morning, sport. Sleep well?

476
00:42:21,201 --> 00:42:24,364
Isn't it wonderful?
We finally rented our room.

477
00:42:25,607 --> 00:42:27,198
I'm not very hungry.

478
00:42:39,188 --> 00:42:43,624
- This is Hogarth Hughes.
- I said he could stay the night, kid.

479
00:42:43,825 --> 00:42:45,019
It's morning now.

480
00:42:45,227 --> 00:42:49,630
I'll try to come over. But there's
this weird guy here who's watching me.

481
00:42:49,831 --> 00:42:51,162
What's that supposed to mean?

482
00:42:51,367 --> 00:42:54,802
I got this big, giant--
Giant thing out here.

483
00:42:55,003 --> 00:42:57,472
I can't talk right now, okay? Bye.

484
00:42:57,805 --> 00:42:59,865
Who was that, sport?
Friend of yours?

485
00:43:00,074 --> 00:43:01,838
Yeah. He's a new kid.

486
00:43:04,246 --> 00:43:07,215
Stop! Stop that! Stop it!

487
00:43:08,416 --> 00:43:11,010
Mind if I ask you
a few questions, buckaroo?

488
00:43:11,219 --> 00:43:14,314
Why would you tell your mom
about a giant robot?

489
00:43:14,524 --> 00:43:16,082
What'd you see at the power station?

490
00:43:16,292 --> 00:43:18,556
Tell anyone else?
How big is this thing?

491
00:43:18,761 --> 00:43:20,160
Been in the forest lately?

492
00:43:20,363 --> 00:43:22,489
Champ? Slugger? Cowboy?
Where you going?

493
00:43:22,699 --> 00:43:24,223
I'm going out!

494
00:43:24,433 --> 00:43:27,528
Why not take Mr. Mansley with you?
Show him the sights.

495
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:29,567
Oh, Mom, the sights?

496
00:43:29,772 --> 00:43:33,401
I'd love that. Give us a chance
to get acquainted, swap stories.

497
00:43:33,609 --> 00:43:35,475
There are two kinds of metal here.

498
00:43:35,678 --> 00:43:37,669
Scrap and art.

499
00:43:37,881 --> 00:43:40,075
If you gotta eat one of them,
eat the scrap.

500
00:43:40,283 --> 00:43:44,379
What you currently have--
in your mouth--is art!!

501
00:43:48,357 --> 00:43:49,517
Art?

502
00:43:55,631 --> 00:43:57,531
Forget it. Forget it!

503
00:43:57,868 --> 00:43:59,835
It's gone. It's--

504
00:44:02,439 --> 00:44:03,736
That's not bad.

505
00:44:07,009 --> 00:44:10,035
First, you take a chocolate bar.
Any bar'll do.

506
00:44:10,346 --> 00:44:11,575
Do you mind if I...?

507
00:44:11,814 --> 00:44:13,372
No, knock yourself out, skipper.

508
00:44:14,216 --> 00:44:16,913
You crumble up the chocolate
into little pieces.

509
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:20,351
Then you kind of stir it
into the ice cream. See?

510
00:44:20,557 --> 00:44:22,684
Yes, I see.
What do you call this again?

511
00:44:22,893 --> 00:44:26,021
Landslide. It's new. Very new.

512
00:44:26,697 --> 00:44:28,630
Landslide.

513
00:44:28,965 --> 00:44:30,489
Topnotch.

514
00:44:31,235 --> 00:44:35,762
You know, Hogarth, we live
in a strange and wondrous time.

515
00:44:36,306 --> 00:44:37,739
The Atomic Age.

516
00:44:38,075 --> 00:44:40,907
But there's a dark side to progress.

517
00:44:41,211 --> 00:44:42,509
Ever hear of Sputnik?

518
00:44:42,711 --> 00:44:45,181
Yeah, it's the first satellite
in space.

519
00:44:45,382 --> 00:44:49,319
Foreign satellite, Hogarth,
and all that that implies.

520
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,046
Even now, it orbits overhead.

521
00:44:53,959 --> 00:44:55,289
Watching us.

522
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:58,162
We can't see it, but it's there.

523
00:44:58,363 --> 00:45:00,660
Much like that giant thing
in the woods.

524
00:45:01,033 --> 00:45:04,730
We don't know what it is
or what it can do. I don't feel safe.

525
00:45:04,937 --> 00:45:05,767
Do you?

526
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:07,336
What are you talking about?

527
00:45:07,539 --> 00:45:10,803
What am I talking about?
What am I talking about?!

528
00:45:11,308 --> 00:45:13,903
I'm talking about
your goldarned security!

529
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:15,807
While you're snoozing
in your jammies...

530
00:45:16,013 --> 00:45:18,539
...back in Washington,
we're wide-awake and worried. Why?

531
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:21,343
Because everyone wants what we have!
Everyone!

532
00:45:21,553 --> 00:45:23,680
You think this metal man is fun.
But who built it?

533
00:45:23,888 --> 00:45:27,450
The Russians? The Chinese? Martians?
Canadians? I don't care!

534
00:45:27,658 --> 00:45:29,990
We didn't build it,
and that's reason enough...

535
00:45:30,194 --> 00:45:32,629
...to assume the worst
and blow it to kingdom come!

536
00:45:32,863 --> 00:45:36,459
Now, you'll tell me about this thing.
You're gonna lead me to it.

537
00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:39,865
And we are going to destroy it
before it destroys us!

538
00:45:41,539 --> 00:45:43,508
Hold that thought and stay right there.

539
00:45:50,615 --> 00:45:53,140
Little lower. Little bit lower....

540
00:45:53,986 --> 00:45:55,452
I thought you were in trouble.

541
00:45:55,653 --> 00:45:56,814
That sucks. Let me....

542
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:59,718
I had to ditch this weird guy
who's staying at our house.

543
00:45:59,925 --> 00:46:01,826
It took me hours to shake him!

544
00:46:02,094 --> 00:46:04,188
I kill myself to get out here!

545
00:46:04,396 --> 00:46:07,764
And you have him doing
arts and crafts.

546
00:46:07,967 --> 00:46:10,764
You got a problem with
arts and crafts, little man?

547
00:46:10,969 --> 00:46:14,929
He's a giant robot, Dean.
It's a little undignified.

548
00:46:16,041 --> 00:46:18,442
Well, smart guy,
what would you have him do?

549
00:46:22,982 --> 00:46:25,415
Main systems on. Main engines.

550
00:46:25,685 --> 00:46:27,209
One, two and three.

551
00:46:27,421 --> 00:46:31,448
All systems go. Five, four, three...

552
00:46:31,657 --> 00:46:33,421
...two, one!

553
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:34,624
Blast off!

554
00:46:45,738 --> 00:46:48,037
We're landing. We're landing!

555
00:46:48,242 --> 00:46:50,709
We're landing!

556
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:58,916
Say, can you guys
cool yourselves a little?

557
00:46:59,153 --> 00:47:00,916
We're pressing our luck here.

558
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:03,111
Hey, baby, we are cool!

559
00:47:03,323 --> 00:47:06,224
Welcome to downtown Coolsville.

560
00:47:06,426 --> 00:47:08,622
Population: us.

561
00:47:08,928 --> 00:47:13,490
Well, can you move Coolsville
to some place less conspicuous?

562
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:15,428
How about the lake?

563
00:47:16,836 --> 00:47:19,203
Come with us. It'll be fun.

564
00:48:10,392 --> 00:48:14,191
This can't last forever.
We gotta tell somebody about him.

565
00:48:14,396 --> 00:48:16,159
You worry too much.

566
00:48:20,769 --> 00:48:22,202
Watch this!

567
00:48:22,403 --> 00:48:24,338
All right, we're watching.

568
00:48:24,539 --> 00:48:27,907
This one's for professionals only!

569
00:48:29,744 --> 00:48:30,905
Banzai!

570
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:40,053
Come on in!

571
00:48:40,789 --> 00:48:42,756
The water's great!

572
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:44,620
No, thanks.

573
00:48:44,827 --> 00:48:46,885
You weenie!

574
00:48:48,597 --> 00:48:49,825
Come on in.

575
00:48:50,032 --> 00:48:53,195
It's really, really refreshing.

576
00:49:00,175 --> 00:49:02,144
What? You too?

577
00:49:02,977 --> 00:49:04,070
You...

578
00:49:04,345 --> 00:49:06,245
...big baby!

579
00:49:11,186 --> 00:49:12,278
Banzai!

580
00:49:53,231 --> 00:49:55,699
You're right in the middle
of the road!

581
00:49:56,367 --> 00:49:57,628
All right.

582
00:50:01,304 --> 00:50:04,501
I think that's enough fun for one day.

583
00:50:19,257 --> 00:50:23,387
Are you okay in there? I'm back
with the toilet paper you needed.

584
00:50:23,593 --> 00:50:26,586
Thanks! I think
I'm feeling better now.

585
00:50:27,231 --> 00:50:28,391
Much.

586
00:50:28,599 --> 00:50:30,157
Much better.

587
00:50:37,775 --> 00:50:39,367
It's beautiful, huh?

588
00:50:40,111 --> 00:50:41,372
Hey, look!

589
00:50:43,313 --> 00:50:44,939
It's a deer.

590
00:50:46,784 --> 00:50:48,342
Let's get closer.

591
00:51:22,255 --> 00:51:24,416
Well, I guess he decided to--

592
00:51:32,597 --> 00:51:34,155
It's the monster!

593
00:51:46,845 --> 00:51:48,574
It's dead.

594
00:51:51,217 --> 00:51:52,445
Dead?

595
00:51:55,755 --> 00:51:56,914
Don't do that!

596
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:00,083
Why?

597
00:52:00,393 --> 00:52:02,759
It's dead. Understand?

598
00:52:03,363 --> 00:52:05,592
They shot it...

599
00:52:05,965 --> 00:52:07,295
...with that gun.

600
00:52:15,807 --> 00:52:17,070
What's wrong?

601
00:52:19,077 --> 00:52:22,740
- Gun.
- Yes. Guns kill.

602
00:52:23,483 --> 00:52:26,280
Guns kill.

603
00:52:51,177 --> 00:52:55,411
I know you feel bad about the deer.
But it's not your fault.

604
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:57,148
Things die.

605
00:52:57,351 --> 00:52:59,115
It's part of life.

606
00:52:59,487 --> 00:53:00,976
It's bad to kill.

607
00:53:01,855 --> 00:53:03,482
But it's not bad to die.

608
00:53:04,224 --> 00:53:06,192
You die?

609
00:53:06,728 --> 00:53:07,751
Well...

610
00:53:09,163 --> 00:53:11,427
...yes, someday.

611
00:53:11,632 --> 00:53:13,931
I die?

612
00:53:14,235 --> 00:53:15,634
I don't know.

613
00:53:15,936 --> 00:53:17,632
You're made of metal...

614
00:53:18,273 --> 00:53:20,433
...but you have feelings.

615
00:53:20,674 --> 00:53:22,608
And you think about things.

616
00:53:22,876 --> 00:53:25,402
And that means you have a soul.

617
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:27,972
And souls don't die.

618
00:53:28,882 --> 00:53:30,509
Soul?

619
00:53:30,884 --> 00:53:34,844
Mom says it's something inside
of all good things...

620
00:53:35,290 --> 00:53:37,985
...and that it goes on
forever and ever.

621
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:55,934
Souls don't die.

622
00:54:09,056 --> 00:54:10,683
You're late for dinner.

623
00:54:13,862 --> 00:54:15,989
Your mom's working late tonight.

624
00:54:16,197 --> 00:54:17,663
So it's just us guys.

625
00:54:17,866 --> 00:54:20,732
And we're gonna have a little chat.
Sit down!

626
00:54:22,001 --> 00:54:24,163
How's that? A little too bright?

627
00:54:24,371 --> 00:54:25,530
Good.

628
00:54:27,608 --> 00:54:30,772
Forgive me. I wanted you
to learn something.

629
00:54:31,113 --> 00:54:32,807
What can I learn from you?

630
00:54:33,015 --> 00:54:34,242
You can learn this:

631
00:54:34,450 --> 00:54:36,474
I can do anything I want,
whenever I want...

632
00:54:36,685 --> 00:54:39,018
...if I feel it's in
the people's best interest.

633
00:54:39,221 --> 00:54:41,190
The giant metal man, where is it?

634
00:54:41,391 --> 00:54:43,859
I don't know what
you're talking about.

635
00:54:44,226 --> 00:54:46,194
You don't? Well.

636
00:54:47,797 --> 00:54:49,730
Does this ring a bell?

637
00:54:51,801 --> 00:54:53,359
How about this?

638
00:54:54,503 --> 00:54:56,301
You've been careless.

639
00:54:56,505 --> 00:54:58,098
It doesn't prove anything.

640
00:54:58,308 --> 00:55:00,435
It's enough to get the Army here
with one call.

641
00:55:00,710 --> 00:55:01,869
What's stopping you?

642
00:55:02,478 --> 00:55:03,605
Where's the giant?!

643
00:55:03,945 --> 00:55:05,915
You can't protect him...

644
00:55:06,315 --> 00:55:09,547
...any more than you can protect
your mother.

645
00:55:09,985 --> 00:55:10,884
My mom?

646
00:55:11,087 --> 00:55:15,114
It's difficult to raise a boy all alone.
We can make it more difficult.

647
00:55:15,492 --> 00:55:17,618
In fact, we can make it so difficult...

648
00:55:17,826 --> 00:55:20,795
...it would be irresponsible
to leave you in her care...

649
00:55:20,996 --> 00:55:22,828
...and all that that implies.

650
00:55:23,032 --> 00:55:25,661
- You'll be taken away from her.
- You can't do that!

651
00:55:25,868 --> 00:55:28,463
Oh, we can. And we will.

652
00:55:32,542 --> 00:55:34,442
He's in the junkyard.

653
00:55:34,743 --> 00:55:37,007
McCoppin's Scrap, off Culver Road.

654
00:55:37,213 --> 00:55:41,650
The junkyard. Of course!
Food for the metal-eater.

655
00:55:42,018 --> 00:55:45,748
I wouldn't worry about this.
It isn't really happening.

656
00:55:46,056 --> 00:55:48,650
This is only a bad dream.

657
00:55:52,529 --> 00:55:54,087
Where's the giant?

658
00:55:55,831 --> 00:55:58,460
This is only a bad dream.

659
00:55:58,868 --> 00:55:59,926
Yes, sir.

660
00:56:00,436 --> 00:56:01,768
This thing is real, sir.

661
00:56:02,070 --> 00:56:06,668
I not only have incontrovertible
evidence, I know where it's hidden.

662
00:56:07,110 --> 00:56:11,206
I don't know who built it, but it's
massive and we're running out of time.

663
00:56:11,414 --> 00:56:13,939
There's no doubt we should act.
The question is...

664
00:56:14,151 --> 00:56:16,209
...can you afford not to?

665
00:56:16,787 --> 00:56:19,017
Excellent, sir.
You won't regret it.

666
00:56:19,457 --> 00:56:20,947
Thank you, sir.

667
00:56:31,268 --> 00:56:34,830
The Army arrives in the morning.
Don't get cute.

668
00:56:40,478 --> 00:56:42,002
I gotta warn Dean.

669
00:56:52,957 --> 00:56:54,515
I'll be watching you.

670
00:58:13,406 --> 00:58:14,669
Morning, Kent.

671
00:58:22,882 --> 00:58:26,910
For some reason, the Army is
in our front yard, Mr. Mansley.

672
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:29,783
Please call me Kent.

673
00:58:55,748 --> 00:58:57,842
- All right, where is it?
- What?

674
00:58:58,051 --> 00:59:00,611
You know darn well what. The monster.

675
00:59:00,821 --> 00:59:03,187
The giant thing. The metal man.

676
00:59:05,859 --> 00:59:09,522
The metal man. Jeez, you were
scaring me there for a second.

677
00:59:09,728 --> 00:59:12,631
I thought I was under attack
or something.

678
00:59:12,933 --> 00:59:14,194
He's in the back.

679
00:59:14,401 --> 00:59:16,392
Come on. I'll show you.

680
00:59:21,843 --> 00:59:23,969
You guys got here just in time.

681
00:59:24,179 --> 00:59:29,081
This rich cat, some industrialist,
wants him for the lobby of his company.

682
00:59:29,284 --> 00:59:31,445
He whipped out his checkbook
on the spot.

683
00:59:31,652 --> 00:59:34,883
I said, "Hey, you got him
for the rest of your life.

684
00:59:35,088 --> 00:59:39,081
But, what, I gotta let go the moment
I give birth? I mean, come on.

685
00:59:39,325 --> 00:59:41,659
Give me some time
to cut the umbilical."

686
00:59:42,963 --> 00:59:44,487
Here he is.

687
00:59:50,839 --> 00:59:52,807
Anyway, I haven't sold him yet.

688
00:59:53,008 --> 00:59:57,240
So if you really want him and if,
you know, you throw in...

689
00:59:57,446 --> 00:59:59,209
...a competitive bid....

690
00:59:59,413 --> 01:00:00,814
Sir, listen.

691
01:00:01,015 --> 01:00:03,006
Step outside, Mansley.

692
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:06,848
You realize how much hardware
I brought out here?!

693
01:00:07,055 --> 01:00:10,855
You just blew millions
of Uncle Sam's dollars out of your butt!

694
01:00:11,060 --> 01:00:15,997
I gotta admit, I'm relieved that
this is what Hogarth was talking about.

695
01:00:16,432 --> 01:00:20,060
I mean, I was beginning to think
it was real.

696
01:00:21,537 --> 01:00:23,730
I mean, don't get me wrong.
I like it.

697
01:00:23,939 --> 01:00:27,238
But do you need all this stuff
on the surface?

698
01:00:28,644 --> 01:00:30,406
No, actually.

699
01:00:31,412 --> 01:00:33,573
It seems kind of slapped on.

700
01:00:33,816 --> 01:00:36,341
Not as thought-out
as this other piece.

701
01:00:36,551 --> 01:00:38,247
You like that one?

702
01:00:40,923 --> 01:00:44,359
You'll be inspector of toilets
by the time I'm finished with you!

703
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:48,928
Now, pack up. I'll expect you back
in Washington to clear out your office.

704
01:00:49,163 --> 01:00:50,392
Yes, sir.

705
01:00:53,836 --> 01:00:55,462
I see why Hogarth sneaks out here.

706
01:00:55,770 --> 01:00:58,001
You mean, you know about that?

707
01:00:59,342 --> 01:01:00,706
Now I do.

708
01:01:14,190 --> 01:01:17,885
Bye, Kent, and all that that implies.

709
01:01:18,094 --> 01:01:19,924
Okay, you can move now.

710
01:01:21,364 --> 01:01:22,762
Nice job!

711
01:01:28,003 --> 01:01:29,732
Thruster to base.

712
01:01:29,941 --> 01:01:31,339
I'm going in.

713
01:01:31,540 --> 01:01:34,635
Only one creature could create
so much destruction.

714
01:01:34,845 --> 01:01:36,539
The hideous, people-eating...

715
01:01:36,747 --> 01:01:40,203
...killing machine, Atomo!

716
01:01:43,821 --> 01:01:45,651
No Atomo.

717
01:01:54,198 --> 01:01:56,097
I Superman.

718
01:01:56,300 --> 01:01:58,232
Okay, Superman.

719
01:01:58,535 --> 01:01:59,696
Take this!

720
01:02:03,673 --> 01:02:04,971
Stupid gun.

721
01:02:18,088 --> 01:02:19,578
What's wrong?

722
01:02:22,425 --> 01:02:24,986
As I was saying, take this!

723
01:02:31,035 --> 01:02:32,468
What happened? What was that--

724
01:02:32,669 --> 01:02:34,605
Stay down and follow me.

725
01:02:41,512 --> 01:02:42,536
Get back!

726
01:02:45,683 --> 01:02:47,878
I said, get back! I mean it!

727
01:02:48,819 --> 01:02:50,913
No, stop. Why?

728
01:02:51,123 --> 01:02:53,022
It was an accident. He's our friend.

729
01:02:53,224 --> 01:02:56,991
He's a piece of hardware.
Why do you think the Army was here?

730
01:02:57,194 --> 01:03:00,790
He's a weapon! A big gun that walks!

731
01:03:04,536 --> 01:03:05,900
I not gun.

732
01:03:06,137 --> 01:03:07,435
Yeah, what's that?

733
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:11,203
You almost did that to Hogarth!

734
01:03:17,115 --> 01:03:18,638
Come back!

735
01:03:18,917 --> 01:03:20,282
- Stop!
- Giant!

736
01:03:20,484 --> 01:03:22,077
Come back!

737
01:03:26,358 --> 01:03:28,053
It was defensive.

738
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:30,524
He reacted to the gun.

739
01:03:33,666 --> 01:03:35,997
You won't get there
fast enough on foot.

740
01:03:55,588 --> 01:03:58,021
See, I told you it was a big hoax.

741
01:03:58,356 --> 01:03:59,914
- Dad said--
- Give me the binoculars.

742
01:04:00,126 --> 01:04:02,423
- What? What?
- There it is. I see it!

743
01:04:03,528 --> 01:04:05,758
It's big. It's walking away.

744
01:04:05,965 --> 01:04:07,932
- Give me those.
- Over there. See it?

745
01:04:08,133 --> 01:04:09,930
The monster! Holy cow!

746
01:04:11,370 --> 01:04:12,496
Watch it!

747
01:04:12,705 --> 01:04:13,730
Help!

748
01:04:13,940 --> 01:04:15,703
Somebody help me!

749
01:04:16,109 --> 01:04:17,873
I don't wanna fall!

750
01:04:19,112 --> 01:04:20,101
Help!

751
01:04:20,313 --> 01:04:21,507
I'm slipping!

752
01:04:21,714 --> 01:04:23,774
I can't hold on much longer!

753
01:04:32,625 --> 01:04:34,217
- Dad!
- Daddy!

754
01:04:37,029 --> 01:04:39,658
- He saved those boys!
- It's friendly!

755
01:04:55,149 --> 01:04:56,139
What--?

756
01:05:01,856 --> 01:05:03,050
Stop! Look!

757
01:05:03,258 --> 01:05:05,418
Look behind you!
The giant, it's attacking!

758
01:05:05,626 --> 01:05:07,720
It's stomping the town! I was right!

759
01:05:07,929 --> 01:05:10,659
- Sweet Mother of God.
- Look, damn you!

760
01:05:18,639 --> 01:05:21,767
I am not a gun.

761
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:46,628
Let's get out of here!

762
01:05:46,833 --> 01:05:48,029
Run!

763
01:05:59,112 --> 01:06:01,547
Stop! There's a kid in his hands!

764
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:03,649
Stop shooting!

765
01:06:04,252 --> 01:06:06,618
He only reacts defensively.

766
01:06:06,821 --> 01:06:10,053
If you don't shoot, he's harmless.
You gotta tell the general!

767
01:06:10,259 --> 01:06:12,227
This is all your fault, beatnik.
If you--

768
01:06:12,428 --> 01:06:13,486
Shut up and listen!

769
01:06:13,696 --> 01:06:17,062
You've gotta make them stop.
The giant's got the kid with him.

770
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:19,259
I'll take care of it.

771
01:06:24,707 --> 01:06:26,230
He says the monster's killed a kid.

772
01:06:26,442 --> 01:06:29,170
Sir, we must stop it at all costs.

773
01:06:29,377 --> 01:06:31,777
Go to code red. Repeat, code red!

774
01:06:33,314 --> 01:06:35,805
Mr. President,
we have a situation, sir.

775
01:06:43,059 --> 01:06:44,389
Watch it, lady!

776
01:06:56,972 --> 01:06:57,802
Look out for the bus!

777
01:07:13,356 --> 01:07:14,720
You can fly?

778
01:07:16,793 --> 01:07:18,623
You can fly!

779
01:07:27,337 --> 01:07:30,636
Try pointing your arms straight ahead,
like Superman!

780
01:07:57,133 --> 01:07:59,897
I've lost visual.
Repeat, lost visual!

781
01:08:04,408 --> 01:08:06,375
Man, that was close!

782
01:08:14,151 --> 01:08:15,015
Gotcha!

783
01:08:32,738 --> 01:08:34,569
Good call, Mansley.

784
01:08:34,773 --> 01:08:39,608
Secure the area. Let's find out
what this thing is and who sent it.

785
01:09:05,704 --> 01:09:08,003
- It's still alive!
- Shoot at it!

786
01:09:31,530 --> 01:09:32,758
Retreat! Retreat!

787
01:09:34,734 --> 01:09:36,530
Let's get out of here!

788
01:09:49,315 --> 01:09:52,374
He's unconscious, but he's okay.
Let's get him in the car.

789
01:09:52,584 --> 01:09:55,577
Drive, baby, drive!
Step on it! Floor it!

790
01:09:55,788 --> 01:09:59,588
It's gaining on us.
Faster! Faster! Hurry!

791
01:10:09,102 --> 01:10:10,967
All battleships fire at the robot!

792
01:10:11,171 --> 01:10:12,263
Now!

793
01:10:12,606 --> 01:10:14,233
Now, damn it, now!

794
01:10:22,348 --> 01:10:25,249
Nothing can stop it!
We've hit it with everything we've got!

795
01:10:25,452 --> 01:10:27,477
Not everything, general. The bomb.

796
01:10:29,388 --> 01:10:31,823
The Nautilus isn't far offshore.

797
01:10:32,793 --> 01:10:34,089
You scare me, Mansley.

798
01:10:34,294 --> 01:10:36,990
You want us to bomb ourselves
in order to kill it?

799
01:10:37,197 --> 01:10:39,530
The giant follows whatever attacks it.

800
01:10:39,734 --> 01:10:42,532
We can lure it away from the town,
then destroy it.

801
01:10:44,272 --> 01:10:48,038
Tell the Nautilus to
target the robot and await my command.

802
01:10:49,611 --> 01:10:52,079
This is Nautilus.
What's the giant's position?

803
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:54,976
67.71972 degrees west...

804
01:10:55,183 --> 01:10:57,879
...by 44.50177 degrees north.

805
01:10:58,253 --> 01:10:59,242
Locked and loaded.

806
01:10:59,654 --> 01:11:01,121
Oh, my baby, I'm so sorry.

807
01:11:01,322 --> 01:11:03,483
- Stop the car.
- Honey, you're all right.

808
01:11:03,691 --> 01:11:05,386
Go back! We've gotta help him!

809
01:11:05,593 --> 01:11:07,925
Are you crazy?
You're lucky to be alive!

810
01:11:08,129 --> 01:11:09,721
We're taking you to a hospital.

811
01:11:15,570 --> 01:11:17,594
Out of the car!
We're evacuating the area.

812
01:11:17,804 --> 01:11:19,898
We gotta get this boy to a hospital.

813
01:11:20,108 --> 01:11:21,598
What boy?

814
01:11:26,848 --> 01:11:28,213
Hogarth, no!

815
01:11:39,227 --> 01:11:40,558
No! Stop!

816
01:11:52,174 --> 01:11:53,402
This is General Rogard.

817
01:11:53,609 --> 01:11:56,975
Ready the attack and prepare
to retreat to the fallback position.

818
01:11:57,179 --> 01:11:59,875
No! Stop! My son is out there!

819
01:12:02,551 --> 01:12:04,018
No, wait. It's me...

820
01:12:04,219 --> 01:12:06,015
...Hogarth. Remember?

821
01:12:06,589 --> 01:12:10,457
It's bad to kill. Guns kill.

822
01:12:10,893 --> 01:12:13,191
And you don't have to be a gun.

823
01:12:13,629 --> 01:12:16,360
You are what you choose to be.

824
01:12:16,699 --> 01:12:18,565
You choose.

825
01:12:19,536 --> 01:12:20,594
Choose.

826
01:12:32,114 --> 01:12:33,672
It's okay. It's okay.

827
01:12:34,083 --> 01:12:36,518
We gotta show them you're good.

828
01:12:39,889 --> 01:12:40,855
Nautilus to Rogard.

829
01:12:41,056 --> 01:12:42,149
Missile armed and ready.

830
01:12:42,359 --> 01:12:44,327
What are you saying, he's friendly?

831
01:12:44,527 --> 01:12:46,688
Attacking him triggers
a defense mechanism.

832
01:12:46,895 --> 01:12:50,797
Don't listen! Destroy the monster
while we still have the chance!

833
01:12:52,034 --> 01:12:54,127
You shoot and the whole thing
starts over.

834
01:12:54,337 --> 01:12:56,202
Stop it now! Our future's at stake!

835
01:12:56,406 --> 01:12:57,236
Orders, sir?

836
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:59,567
Which is why you have got to stop.

837
01:12:59,775 --> 01:13:01,641
It's getting closer! Orders, sir?!

838
01:13:01,845 --> 01:13:02,675
Don't shoot!

839
01:13:03,747 --> 01:13:05,544
Hold your fire! The boy's alive?

840
01:13:05,748 --> 01:13:06,909
It's a trick! Launch it.

841
01:13:07,117 --> 01:13:08,812
Are you mad, Mansley?

842
01:13:09,019 --> 01:13:10,748
All units, stand down!

843
01:13:10,953 --> 01:13:13,319
Rogard to Nautilus.
Come in, Nautilus.

844
01:13:13,523 --> 01:13:14,854
Nautilus standing by.

845
01:13:15,058 --> 01:13:16,319
Launch the missile now!

846
01:13:24,134 --> 01:13:26,761
It's targeted
to the giant's current position!

847
01:13:27,437 --> 01:13:29,166
Where's the giant, Mansley?

848
01:13:32,877 --> 01:13:35,869
We can duck and cover.
There's a shelter right there.

849
01:13:36,079 --> 01:13:38,843
There's no way to survive this,
you idiot!

850
01:13:39,050 --> 01:13:40,881
You mean, we're all going to--

851
01:13:41,084 --> 01:13:44,646
To die, Mansley, for our country.

852
01:13:45,189 --> 01:13:48,021
Screw our country! I want to live!

853
01:13:54,066 --> 01:13:55,192
Hold him, men.

854
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:59,200
Make sure he stays here,
like a good soldier.

855
01:14:13,218 --> 01:14:14,344
It's a missile.

856
01:14:14,553 --> 01:14:16,521
When it comes down...

857
01:14:17,089 --> 01:14:18,852
...everyone will die.

858
01:14:19,057 --> 01:14:19,921
There it is!

859
01:14:36,575 --> 01:14:39,874
- Shouldn't we get to a shelter?
- It wouldn't matter.

860
01:14:40,277 --> 01:14:42,542
I fix.

861
01:14:49,353 --> 01:14:50,321
Giant?

862
01:14:57,129 --> 01:14:59,563
You stay.

863
01:15:00,866 --> 01:15:03,357
I go.

864
01:15:08,607 --> 01:15:11,337
No following.

865
01:15:21,454 --> 01:15:22,818
I love you.

866
01:15:51,318 --> 01:15:52,876
You are who you choose to be.

867
01:15:56,156 --> 01:15:58,590
Superman.

868
01:16:30,591 --> 01:16:32,149
Let's go home.

869
01:17:18,973 --> 01:17:21,909
Your best work yet, honey.
No doubt about it.

870
01:17:22,111 --> 01:17:24,807
You think this is my best? Really?

871
01:17:25,981 --> 01:17:28,882
You know, next to that bug thing.

872
01:17:29,218 --> 01:17:32,051
You know, the one with the shovels....

873
01:17:33,923 --> 01:17:35,982
Come on, honey. Time to go.

874
01:17:36,191 --> 01:17:37,214
See you later, guys.

875
01:17:37,426 --> 01:17:39,394
See you later, Hogarth.

876
01:17:40,663 --> 01:17:42,961
- The general sent this to you.
- What is it?

877
01:17:43,165 --> 01:17:45,690
He said it was
the only part recovered.

878
01:17:45,901 --> 01:17:47,994
He thought you should have it.

879
01:17:50,071 --> 01:17:51,732
I miss him.

880
01:18:40,925 --> 01:18:42,392
See you later!

881
01:18:43,305 --> 01:19:43,507
