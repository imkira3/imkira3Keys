01:37:41,403 --> 01:37:44,323
I think it's the most wonderful place
in the whole world.

1503
01:37:44,406 --> 01:37:46,575
WONKA: I'm very pleased
to hear you say that...

1504
01:37:46,658 --> 01:37:48,952
because I'm giving it to you.

1505
01:37:50,078 --> 01:37:52,498
CHARLIE: What?
WONKA: That's all right, isn't it?

1506
01:37:52,581 --> 01:37:55,417
GRANDPA: You're giving Charlie-
WONKA: I can't go on forever.

1507
01:37:55,501 --> 01:37:57,753
WONKA: And I don't really want to try.

1508
01:37:57,836 --> 01:38:00,881
So who can I trust
to run the factory when I leave...

1509
01:38:00,964 --> 01:38:02,925
and take care
of the Oompa Loompas for me?

1510
01:38:03,008 --> 01:38:04,426
Not a grownup.

1511
01:38:04,510 --> 01:38:07,930
A grownup would want to do everything
his own way, not mine.

1512
01:38:08,013 --> 01:38:11,767
That's why I decided a long time ago
that I had to find a child.

1513
01:38:11,850 --> 01:38:15,270
A very honest, loving child...

1514
01:38:15,771 --> 01:38:19,274
to whom I can tell all my most precious
candy-making secrets.

1515
01:38:19,358 --> 01:38:22,027
CHARLIE: So, you sent the Golden Tickets?
WONKA: Right.

1516
01:38:22,110 --> 01:38:24,780
<i>The factory's yours.
You can move in immediately.</i>

1517
01:38:24,863 --> 01:38:26,865
GRANDPA: And me?
WONKA: Absolutely.

1518
01:38:27,032 --> 01:38:29,618
CHARLIE: What happens to the-
WONKA: The whole family.

1519
01:38:29,701 --> 01:38:31,662
I want you to bring them all.

1520
01:38:35,207 --> 01:38:36,959
But, Charlie...

1521
01:38:37,459 --> 01:38:41,421
don't forget what happened to the man
who suddenly got everything he wanted.

1522
01:38:41,505 --> 01:38:42,881
CHARLIE: What happened?

1523
01:38:42,965 --> 01:38:45,300
He lived happily ever after.

1524
01:38:47,219 --> 01:38:49,888
