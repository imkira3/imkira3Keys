For three decades,
the Kowolski family bakery

12
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,491
has been a mainstay
in downtown Buffalo,

13
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:19,578
known for their
sinfully sweet,
cream-filled Polski Pierogis,

14
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:23,457
and the occasional
sugar-induced coma
that follows.

00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:26,418

their 30th anniversary,

or a spoon?

lt's a good thing
we're wearing these today,

21

So tell me, Mama.
Why make
Buffalo's biggest cookie?

will be happy?

The previous Buffalo record
was eight feet, seven inches,

36
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,333
baked by Gladys Pelsnick.

37
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:51,503
lf this cookie beats Gladys's,
it will prove once and for all

38
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,964
that the Kowolskis
have much more free time.

39
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:57,676
And the cookie is 1 0 feet,
four inches.

messing with you, Bruce.

to the board,

so we'll have something
to put on the air today?

of a ceiling here.

by the way. Loving it.

He gets on sweeps. Maybe
l should be more like Evan.

You don't wanna be like Evan.
Evan's an asshole.

No, Bruce. You can't.

As everyone knows,
after 33 years, our beloved
Pete Fineman is retiring.

virtually impossible to fill,
but the show must go on,

no one better than
our very own Evan Baxter.

the great Pete Fineman,
but l will do my best.

to be a part of our
local community of Buffalo,

256
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:48,595
and l think, in a lot of ways,
a great city is like
a great recipe, really.

add some caregivers,
maybe a few nuts,

with the love and support
of our good families.

one sweet place to live.

to freeze your big,
