00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:35,762
Good morning.

3
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:40,725
Peter, are you okay?

4
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:49,374
You're up early today.

5
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:56,634
CURSE - GRUDGE

6
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:17,882
Hi.

7
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:21,177
Excuse me.

8
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:28,225
Hi, Emma.

9
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:31,312
It's good to see you again.

10
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:37,985
Do you remember me?

11
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:40,529
It's Yoko.

12
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:28,632
- Sorry. Did I wake you?
- Bottom drawer.

13
00:08:38,602 --> 00:08:39,935
Thank you.

14
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:43,439
- You know me so well.
- Come back to bed.

15
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,609
I can't. I'm gonna be late
for my architecture midterm.

16
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,278
Check your watch.

17
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:59,580
I set the clock an hour ahead last night.

18
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:06,128
Maybe you know me too well.

19
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,721
I'm really glad you decided
to come here with me.

20
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:18,474
- Me, too.
- You sure?

21
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:21,143
Of course. Why?

22
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:25,731
- It's a big deal, you know.
- Lots of people go abroad.

23
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:31,028
Besides, you've been dreaming
about coming here forever.

24
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,530
I'm just glad we could be together.

25
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:43,248
- Don't you have class today?
- Nope.

26
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:46,001
Just have to pick up a book
I left at the Care Center.

27
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:50,381
Come on, you could spare 10 minutes.
I promise I'll get you to class on time.

28
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:36,218
- Where are you going?
- Come here. I wanna show you something.

29
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:44,643
It's a Buddhist ritual.

30
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:48,564
The incense smoke carries the prayers
to the spirits of their ancestors.

31
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,357
It's to help them find peace.

32
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:56,947
They must have lost someone they loved.

33
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,455
Excuse me.

34
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,666
Come on.

35
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,760
Karen?

36
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:20,012
- Karen?
- Yes, Alex?

37
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:24,725
- Are you free this afternoon?
- Just a test to study for. Why?

38
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:29,063
Your wish has been granted.
Your first visit alone.

39
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,358
Just make sure she has what she needs
and help out around the house.

40
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:36,779
It's Yoko's case, but she didn't show up
for work this morning.

41
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,990
I can't get her on the phone.
She must be sick or something.

42
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:43,160
And she has the damn house key.

43
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,622
What's this phrase?

44
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:51,794
That's "severe lethargy
with mild dementia."

45
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:58,383
Apparently, she sleeps
through most of the day.

46
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:01,637
Her daughter-in-law doesn't work,
so she'll probably be there.

47
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,100
It's an English-language house,
so you should be fine.

48
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:08,060
Here's the address.

49
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,145
You can use the wall chart
if you need help

50
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:13,440
and don't forget to bring a map, okay?

51
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:19,738
Don't worry, Karen. You're ready.

52
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,241
Excuse me...

53
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,827
I'm looking for this house.

54
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:10,581
I think it's that way.

55
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:50,222
Hello?

56
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:12,911
Is anybody here?

57
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:36,101
Oh, my God. Are you all right? Come here.

58
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,664
Okay, Emma.

59
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,252
My name's Karen Davis.

60
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:08,467
I'm from the Care Center.
I'm substituting for Yoko, just for today.

61
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:17,976
Looks like you need a new bandage.

62
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,608
How did that happen, Emma?

63
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:09,694
Hello?

64
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:40,535
Yes, he was shut in the closet.
There was tape all around the door.

65
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,456
They're not home yet.

66
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:49,878
I don't know.
Emma still hasn't said a word to me.

67
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:54,174
No, he won't come down.

68
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:56,843
Yes, I'm sure he's Japanese.

69
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:03,600
I know. I'm sorry, Alex. Okay.

70
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:06,144
Just get here as soon as you can.

71
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,472
Toshio.

72
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:09,517
Toshio.

73
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:25,366
Matthew and Jennifer aren't around.
Leave a message.

74
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:30,413
Hey, guys, it's Susan.
Matt, are you there? Pick up.

75
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:34,793
Okay, I'm leaving work now,
so you can try my cell

76
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:37,087
or give me a call at home later.

77
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:41,216
I just want to make sure Mom's okay.

78
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,593
So just call me when you can, okay?

79
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,334
Emma.

80
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:25,260
Who are you talking to?

81
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:35,145
I just want her to leave me alone.

82
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:42,110
You need to get some rest, okay?

83
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:08,928

84

LOOKING FOR OCCUPANT
Happy Home Sect. Ltd.

85
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:33,161
Welcome. What do you think?

86
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:37,540
Your shoes.

87
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:42,170
- Even in your own house?
- Even in your own house.

88
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,593
It's perfect for Mom.

89
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:52,430
She won't even have to
deal with the stairs.

90
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:04,567
- Hey, where's Mom?
- I'll look for her.

91
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,251
Mom?

92
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:06,587
Mom?

93
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:18,891
Come on, Mom.
You know what the doctor said about stairs.

94
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:23,062
- Is she okay?
- Yeah.

95
00:25:23,147 --> 00:25:24,647
Hey, Mom.

96
00:25:27,151 --> 00:25:28,443
What?

97
00:25:29,403 --> 00:25:32,113
Mom, are you all right?

98
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:53,319
Suzuki-san?

99
00:26:55,280 --> 00:27:00,243
- We'll take it.
- Okay.

100
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:02,263
Morning.

101
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:04,056
Morning.

102
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:09,061
I hope Mom's okay.
She's been sleeping ever since we got here.

103
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:11,731
Not at night.

104
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:16,777
I've told you, Matthew,
you can sleep through anything.

105
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:19,113
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

106
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:23,034
I'm sure it was just the move.
She'll get back on schedule.

107
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:27,955
- Have you seen my travel mug?
- I haven't unpacked it yet.

108
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:35,254
Maybe you should say something
to the helper.

109
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:37,298
- What's her name?
- Yoko.

110
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:40,885
Who knows?
Maybe she can suggest something.

111
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:42,261
Maybe.

112
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:46,807
I miss seeing this.

113
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:53,231
I guess now we're
gonna have to talk in the morning.

114
00:28:57,027 --> 00:28:58,778
Hey, kiddo, you okay?

115
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:04,742
Jen? Sorry, honey, are you all right?

116
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:09,789
What's up?

117
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,420
I went for a walk yesterday.

118
00:29:16,797 --> 00:29:18,172
Just to explore.

119
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:22,593
And I got so lost.

120
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:28,182
And I couldn't find anyone
who spoke English that could help me.

121
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:35,481
This will get easier soon. I promise.

122
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:40,278
Or else?

123
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:47,535
Or else I tell the company
it's just not working out.

124
00:29:47,995 --> 00:29:51,664
And we're going back to the States
with or without my old job.

125
00:29:54,418 --> 00:29:57,503
They can find somebody else
to crunch their numbers.

126
00:29:59,089 --> 00:30:01,549
But until then,

127
00:30:02,843 --> 00:30:06,470
promise me you'll give it a good try,
okay, Jen?

128
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:09,015
Deal.

129
00:31:26,927 --> 00:31:30,054
If you want something,
all you have to do is say so.

130
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:34,827
Who's there?

131
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:23,542
Hey, Jen?

132
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:26,462
Jen?

133
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:46,899
What the hell...

134
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:52,738
Mom?

135
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,619
Are you all right?

136
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:03,541
Mom, where's Jennifer?

137
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,720
Come on.

138
00:34:17,097 --> 00:34:18,097
Hey, Jen?

139
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:24,937
You scared...

140
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:30,276
Jen? Honey?

141
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,407
Honey, what is it? What's wrong?

142
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:43,956
What happened? Honey, what is it?

143
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:45,749
What?

144
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,424
Honey, I'm gonna call an ambulance,
all right?

145
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:06,638
Who are you? What are you doing here?

146
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:28,602
Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.

147
00:36:32,399 --> 00:36:33,399
Karen?

148
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,492
Mrs. Williams.

149
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:47,538
Mrs...

150
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,045
Karen?

151
00:36:57,841 --> 00:36:58,841
Karen!

152
00:37:10,437 --> 00:37:11,478
INVESTIGATION

153
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:30,205
I am Detective Nakagawa.
This is Detective Igarashi, my assistant.

154
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:31,415
Hi.

155
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:34,668
Is Karen okay?

156
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:37,963
She is very shaken.

157
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:41,967
We would like her to stay
in the hospital tonight under evaluation.

158
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:45,596
Do you know these people?

159
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:54,062
Yeah, that's Matthew Williams
and his wife, Jennifer.

160
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:59,443
He's the son of the woman
Karen came here to see.

161
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,281
When was the last time you saw them?

162
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:09,203
When they came in to register.

163
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:12,122
It's standard procedure,

164
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:14,416
although the visits were arranged
by his employer.

165
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:17,628
- I think he works at...
- We've spoken with his employer.

166
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:19,963
He hasn't shown up for work today.

167
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:26,595
If you could please come by tomorrow
and make a statement.

168
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:30,349
The address is there at the bottom.

169
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:38,607
- Yoko.
- I'm sorry?

170
00:38:43,613 --> 00:38:45,447
Karen's a substitute.

171
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:48,367
Yoko's the girl
who's normally in charge of Emma.

172
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:51,912
She's also been missing from work.

173
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:54,164
For how long?

174
00:38:56,668 --> 00:39:00,087
Since yesterday.
I think I saw her bike outside.

175
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:28,365
Hey, guys, it's Susan.
Matt, are you there? Pick up.

176
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:33,453
Okay, I'm leaving work now,
so you can try my cell

177
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:35,539
or give me a call at home later.

178
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:37,124
I'm just a little worried about Mom.

179
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:39,293
I just want to make sure she's okay.

180
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:41,712
So just call me when you can, okay?

181
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:47,217
Thursday, 8:27 p.m. End of messages.

182
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:50,679
That's Matthew's sister.

183
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:52,472
This must be her.

184
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:56,393
It seems she works here in Tokyo.

185
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:59,605
Call her at work, then try home.

186
00:39:59,689 --> 00:40:02,149
If no one answers send someone.

187
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:04,818
Yes, Sir.

188
00:42:25,001 --> 00:42:26,918
Nagakawa-san...

189
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:31,006
who does that belong to?

190
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:09,085
It's okay. I've got you.

191
00:43:12,465 --> 00:43:16,384
Your boss told me what happened.
I'm sorry.

192
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:24,226
I'm not even sure what did happen.

193
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:28,188
An old woman passed away in her sleep.

194
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:32,609
- It's sad, but that's all it is.
- Is that how they're saying she died?

195
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:42,410
That house.

196
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:47,249
There was something...

197
00:43:54,799 --> 00:43:56,758
It's okay, Karen.

198
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:09,437
I'm sorry to disturb you, Miss Davis.

199
00:44:10,231 --> 00:44:13,650
I was wondering if you could answer
some additional questions.

200
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:22,367
How are you feeling?

201
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:25,871
Okay. Tired.

202
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:30,959
- You are an exchange student?
- Yes.

203
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:35,547
And you have been volunteering
at the Care Center for...

204
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:39,175
Three months.
I needed a social welfare credit.

205
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:44,306
You said this was the first time
you'd been in that house?

206
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:46,808
Yeah.

207
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:52,731
About the Japanese boy
you said you saw there...

208
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:55,650
- Did you find him?
- No, not yet.

209
00:44:57,653 --> 00:45:00,447
You said the boy had been taped
into the closet?

210
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:02,073
That's right.

211
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:06,494
And there was a book, a journal.

212
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:08,455
Did it belong to the boy?

213
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:12,500
I don't think so.
I think it belonged to a woman.

214
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:17,672
The writing looked feminine.

215
00:45:19,175 --> 00:45:21,885
Did you speak with the boy
after you opened the closet?

216
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:22,969
Briefly.

217
00:45:23,346 --> 00:45:26,556
I asked his name. He said it was Toshio.

218
00:45:34,941 --> 00:45:36,775
One more question, please.

219
00:45:40,029 --> 00:45:42,238
We found this in the hallway.

220
00:45:45,618 --> 00:45:46,952
This is him.

221
00:45:47,036 --> 00:45:48,328
This is the boy.

222
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:55,877
Detective Nakagawa?

223
00:45:56,545 --> 00:45:58,797
The whole time I was in that house,

224
00:45:59,924 --> 00:46:01,883
I felt something was wrong.

225
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:08,223
What happened there?

226
00:46:16,941 --> 00:46:20,318
The bodies of the son and daughter-in-law

227
00:46:20,403 --> 00:46:23,321
of the woman you were caring for
were found in the attic.

228
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:28,868
It seems that the son killed his wife,
and then himself.

229
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:40,797
Please excuse me for a moment.

230
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:52,934
We checked the apartment of Susan,
the sister.

231
00:46:53,019 --> 00:46:54,853
She wasn't there.

232
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:58,231
And?

233
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:02,777
It's strange, but the chain lock
had been drawn from the inside.

234
00:47:03,029 --> 00:47:06,239
It seems she did come home
but no one was in the room.

235
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:15,582
Get the surveillance tapes from where
she works.

236
00:47:17,752 --> 00:47:18,877
They were...

237
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:25,467
They were the first family
to live in that house...

238
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:34,100
since the discovery in the
attic three years ago.

239
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:39,856
Do you know anything about this?

240
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:02,003
Three years ago.

241
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:11,721
Matthew and Jennifer aren't around.
Leave a message.

242
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:17,894
Hey, guys, it's Susan.
Matt, are you there? Pick up.

243
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:23,483
Okay, I'm leaving work now,
so you can try my cell,

244
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:25,860
or give me a call at home later.

245
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:28,113
I'm just a little worried about Mom.

246
00:48:28,197 --> 00:48:30,782
I just want to make sure she's okay.

247
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:34,035
So just call me when you can, okay?

248
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:44,564
Matthew?

249
00:49:49,612 --> 00:49:51,362
Matthew, stop it.

250
00:50:18,766 --> 00:50:20,433
Is anyone there?

251
00:50:59,515 --> 00:51:01,140
Excuse me!

252
00:51:01,517 --> 00:51:05,228
Please. There was something on the...

253
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:09,774
On the tenth floor...

254
00:51:10,943 --> 00:51:13,027
there was something...

255
00:51:13,112 --> 00:51:15,613
something strange.

256
00:51:15,698 --> 00:51:19,200
- Sit down, please.
- Please, just help.

257
00:55:06,678 --> 00:55:07,678
Hello?

258
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:09,013
It's me.

259
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:12,558
Matthew.

260
00:55:14,895 --> 00:55:17,271
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm downstairs.

261
00:55:17,773 --> 00:55:19,774
What number are you again?

262
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:22,151
1601. I'll buzz you in.

263
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,854
I don't know what you're up...

264
00:57:25,901 --> 00:57:27,777
What are you doing here?

265
00:57:27,903 --> 00:57:31,739
I thought they weren't gonna let you go
until tonight. Did you escape?

266
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:34,825
I just had to get out of there.

267
00:57:37,329 --> 00:57:39,205
I didn't wanna be alone.

268
00:57:42,042 --> 00:57:43,417
Okay, Karen.

269
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:46,962
Hold on a second.

270
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:52,927
I was wondering if I could
take the rest of the day off?

271
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:11,654
Karen? Karen.

272
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:19,412
What's wrong?

273
00:58:22,541 --> 00:58:23,541
Hey.

274
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:27,420
Talk to me.

275
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:35,428
I think I saw something in that house.

276
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:40,182
Emma and I were alone in that room,

277
00:58:42,894 --> 00:58:45,604
but I think there was something else
there with us.

278
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:48,941
Karen, what is it?

279
00:58:51,319 --> 00:58:52,319
Karen.

280
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:01,844
I just wanna go home.

281
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:29,583
Hello?

282
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:47,560
Yoko?

283
01:01:17,299 --> 01:01:19,899
What happened, Yoko?

284
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:54,491
My name is Karen Davis.
I'm really sorry to bother you.

285
01:05:55,493 --> 01:05:58,287
I was wondering
if I could ask you a few questions.

286
01:05:58,371 --> 01:06:00,747
Questions about what?

287
01:06:01,124 --> 01:06:03,500
I realize this is really awkward.

288
01:06:04,627 --> 01:06:06,378
I'm here because

289
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:12,259
I need to ask you a few questions
about your husband.

290
01:06:18,141 --> 01:06:19,975
So, how did you know Peter?

291
01:06:24,105 --> 01:06:27,316
I think there's a connection
between your husband's death

292
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:29,318
and something that happened to me.

293
01:06:31,362 --> 01:06:33,155
What happened to you?

294
01:06:36,075 --> 01:06:37,659
It's hard to explain.

295
01:06:42,790 --> 01:06:44,750
I know this sounds strange,

296
01:06:46,169 --> 01:06:48,879
but I don't think your husband
wanted to die.

297
01:06:48,963 --> 01:06:51,840
Then why would he throw himself
out a window?

298
01:07:12,946 --> 01:07:15,155
Did you know a woman named Kayako?

299
01:07:17,659 --> 01:07:18,784
No.

300
01:07:19,369 --> 01:07:20,827
Did your husband?

301
01:07:21,746 --> 01:07:23,121
I don't think so.

302
01:07:23,998 --> 01:07:25,582
Maybe it was somebody he worked with.

303
01:07:25,667 --> 01:07:26,833
Look,

304
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:30,545
I have had the police up here,

305
01:07:31,881 --> 01:07:35,676
I've talked to detectives,
I've hired private investigators.

306
01:07:36,177 --> 01:07:38,512
I don't know what you're going through.

307
01:07:40,098 --> 01:07:42,182
I don't have any answers for you.

308
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:43,976
Sorry.

309
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:45,310
Please.

310
01:07:45,687 --> 01:07:47,646
I don't know what else to do.

311
01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:50,357
Please help me.

312
01:07:56,656 --> 01:07:59,074
This is all his stuff from school.

313
01:08:03,037 --> 01:08:05,122
This is from our first date.

314
01:09:13,232 --> 01:09:14,357
My God.

315
01:09:17,069 --> 01:09:18,069
Peter!

316
01:09:18,905 --> 01:09:20,155
Hey, Shimizu.

317
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:25,786
- Happy Monday.
- Yeah, right.

318
01:09:27,079 --> 01:09:28,371
Here's your mail.

319
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:33,585
- Another one?
- Yeah.

320
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:35,962
I have no idea.

321
01:09:36,047 --> 01:09:38,757
She says she used to be
in one of my classes,

322
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:41,551
but I don't know who the hell she is.

323
01:09:41,761 --> 01:09:43,929
- Thanks.
- No problem.

324
01:09:45,348 --> 01:09:47,140
- Have a good one.
- Thanks.

325
01:09:54,273 --> 01:09:55,565
"Kayako Saeki... Kayako Saeki...
Kayako Saeki"

326
01:10:49,787 --> 01:10:51,580
Hello?

327
01:10:54,667 --> 01:10:56,293
Is your mother home?

328
01:11:11,517 --> 01:11:12,809
Hello?

329
01:11:22,403 --> 01:11:23,528
Hi.

330
01:11:45,509 --> 01:11:47,093
Are you alone here?

331
01:13:48,883 --> 01:13:52,719
Detective Nakagawa,
I need to speak with you.

332
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:58,850
The woman who was murdered in that house
three years ago knew this man.

333
01:13:59,268 --> 01:14:02,103
He committed suicide
the morning after she died.

334
01:14:02,897 --> 01:14:05,648
I don't believe he killed himself.

335
01:14:07,318 --> 01:14:10,403
I don't understand. What's happening?

336
01:14:13,157 --> 01:14:14,908
Three years ago,

337
01:14:15,576 --> 01:14:18,078
three of my colleagues, my friends

338
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:21,706
began investigating a case.

339
01:14:23,125 --> 01:14:26,586
Two died mysteriously,
and one disappeared.

340
01:14:29,048 --> 01:14:32,509
They had been investigating the murders
at that house.

341
01:14:33,928 --> 01:14:37,263
Are you saying the detectives died
because of that house?

342
01:14:39,517 --> 01:14:42,852
I've been in that house. So have you!

343
01:14:49,193 --> 01:14:50,819
It is said in Japan,

344
01:14:50,903 --> 01:14:54,197
that when a person dies
in extreme sorrow or rage,

345
01:14:55,658 --> 01:14:57,283
the emotion remains,

346
01:14:58,327 --> 01:15:00,745
becoming a stain upon that place.

347
01:15:02,915 --> 01:15:05,333
Death becomes a part of that place,

348
01:15:06,919 --> 01:15:09,129
killing everything it touches.

349
01:15:12,258 --> 01:15:14,634
Once you have become a part of it,

350
01:15:16,637 --> 01:15:19,389
it will never let you go.

351
01:15:34,613 --> 01:15:34,654
Corpses abandoned in garbage bag

352
01:15:34,655 --> 01:15:35,989
Corpses abandoned in garbage bag

353
01:15:46,458 --> 01:15:48,001
INVESTIGATION - KEEP OUT

354
01:16:16,488 --> 01:16:20,575
METROPOLITAN POLICE DEPARTMENT
KEEP OUT

355
01:17:30,604 --> 01:17:31,729
Boy!

356
01:17:32,231 --> 01:17:33,481
Boy!

357
01:17:55,671 --> 01:17:56,671
Doug?

358
01:18:45,429 --> 01:18:46,721
Karen, it's me.

359
01:18:46,889 --> 01:18:49,098
Look, where have you been all day?

360
01:18:50,476 --> 01:18:52,268
I'm really worried about you.

361
01:18:52,352 --> 01:18:54,270
The Care Center called.

362
01:18:54,354 --> 01:18:56,147
Alex and Yoko are dead.

363
01:18:57,941 --> 01:18:59,734
I found your research and...

364
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:02,153
Did you go to that house?

365
01:19:05,407 --> 01:19:06,908
I'm coming to find you.

366
01:19:09,161 --> 01:19:11,162
If you get this, stay there.

367
01:19:11,997 --> 01:19:13,122
I love you.

368
01:19:25,803 --> 01:19:26,803
Karen?

369
01:20:17,312 --> 01:20:18,479
Doug?

370
01:20:19,523 --> 01:20:23,317
- Hey. Did you get my message?
- Doug!

371
01:20:24,278 --> 01:20:26,445
I just wanted you to know...

372
01:21:09,156 --> 01:21:10,573
Don't worry,

373
01:21:10,657 --> 01:21:12,033
it isn't any problem.

374
01:21:13,368 --> 01:21:14,535
I love you.

375
01:21:15,370 --> 01:21:17,205
I'll call you before I leave.

376
01:21:19,416 --> 01:21:20,416
I love you.

377
01:21:22,127 --> 01:21:23,211
Ten minutes.

378
01:21:23,795 --> 01:21:25,630
Yeah, I'll be home soon.

379
01:21:26,798 --> 01:21:28,257
Yeah, love you, too.

380
01:21:43,899 --> 01:21:51,899
Guess your mom's gonna be late.

381
01:29:08,301 --> 01:29:09,968
Doug? Doug?

382
01:30:47,233 --> 01:30:48,233
Doug?

383
01:33:05,371 --> 01:33:08,081
Male Caucasian, around mid-20's.

384
01:33:09,250 --> 01:33:11,168
How about the woman in question?

385
01:33:11,586 --> 01:33:13,211
We're sending for her right now.

386
01:33:17,842 --> 01:33:20,635
How did she survive?

387
01:33:23,598 --> 01:33:26,308
We're still investigating...

388
01:33:26,392 --> 01:33:29,019
we were able to save the house.
