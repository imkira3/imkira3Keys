00:01:14,451 --> 00:01:16,386
<i>The future.</i>

3
00:01:16,411 --> 00:01:19,831
<i>A dark, desolate world.</i>

4
00:01:25,712 --> 00:01:31,009
<i>A world of
war, suffering, loss...</i>

5
00:01:31,301 --> 00:01:33,278
<i>on both sides.</i>

6
00:01:34,346 --> 00:01:38,809
<i>Mutants and the humans
who dared to help them.</i>

7
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:46,441
<i>Fighting an enemy
we cannot defeat.</i>

8
00:02:13,302 --> 00:02:16,221
<i>Are we destined down this path?</i>

9
00:02:16,596 --> 00:02:21,768
<i>Destined to destroy ourselves
like so many species before us?</i>

10
00:02:25,397 --> 00:02:29,151
<i>Or can we evolve fast
enough to change ourselves?</i>

11
00:02:29,776 --> 00:02:31,153
<i>Change our fate?</i>

12
00:02:37,367 --> 00:02:40,746
<i>Is the future truly set?</i>

13
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:11,253
They're here!

14
00:04:16,967 --> 00:04:18,026
Time's up.

15
00:04:18,051 --> 00:04:19,094
Sentinels!

16
00:04:23,348 --> 00:04:24,349
Sunspot!

17
00:04:29,271 --> 00:04:30,397
Let's go.

18
00:05:15,484 --> 00:05:16,835
Run!

19
00:05:18,487 --> 00:05:19,488
Go!

20
00:07:00,213 --> 00:07:01,965
Blink! No!

21
00:07:49,137 --> 00:07:50,555
Too late, assholes.

22
00:08:10,158 --> 00:08:11,701
Don't move, you mutant scum!

23
00:08:15,413 --> 00:08:16,581
No!

24
00:08:17,957 --> 00:08:20,226
Flat on the ground,
hands behind your head!

25
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:27,717
<i>So few of us left.</i>

26
00:08:31,096 --> 00:08:32,138
<i>Professor?</i>

27
00:08:33,431 --> 00:08:34,683
I've found them.

28
00:10:06,983 --> 00:10:08,109
Professor!

29
00:10:10,153 --> 00:10:11,362
Bobby.
Hey, Storm.

30
00:10:12,489 --> 00:10:13,531
Hey, kid.

31
00:10:14,532 --> 00:10:17,076
Professor, you made it.

32
00:10:28,797 --> 00:10:31,758
Whenever the Sentinels attack,
Warpath spots them...

33
00:10:32,425 --> 00:10:34,360
then I send Bishop
back to warn us

34
00:10:34,385 --> 00:10:36,137
of the attack before it happens.

35
00:10:36,513 --> 00:10:38,807
Blink scouts the next site...

36
00:10:39,557 --> 00:10:41,893
and then we leave before they
ever know we were there.

37
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,687
Because...
we never were.

38
00:10:44,854 --> 00:10:46,689
What do you mean
you were never there?

39
00:10:46,856 --> 00:10:48,541
She projects Bishop back in time

40
00:10:48,566 --> 00:10:49,901
a few days to warn the others...

41
00:10:50,068 --> 00:10:51,694
of the coming attack.

42
00:10:51,861 --> 00:10:53,988
So she sends
Bishop back in time?

43
00:10:54,113 --> 00:10:56,783
No, just his consciousness,
into his younger self.

44
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:58,201
His younger body.

45
00:10:58,993 --> 00:11:00,161
Wow.

46
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:03,957
This might just work, Charles.

47
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:06,251
What might work?

48
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,854
The Sentinel program
was originally

49
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:12,048
conceived by
Doctor Bolivar Trask.

50
00:11:12,382 --> 00:11:16,845
In the early '70s, he was one of the
world's leading weapons designers.

51
00:11:17,095 --> 00:11:21,307
<i>But, covertly, he had begun
experimenting on mutants...</i>

52
00:11:21,474 --> 00:11:24,644
<i>using their gifts
to fuel his own research.</i>

53
00:11:24,811 --> 00:11:26,187
This is extraordinary.

54
00:11:26,354 --> 00:11:29,566
<i>There was one mutant who
had discovered what he was doing.</i>

55
00:11:29,774 --> 00:11:34,737
A mutant with the ability to
transform herself into anyone.

56
00:11:35,238 --> 00:11:36,656
Mystique.

57
00:11:37,532 --> 00:11:39,617
<i>I knew her as Raven.</i>

58
00:11:39,826 --> 00:11:41,302
We met when we were children,

59
00:11:41,327 --> 00:11:43,162
grew up together.

60
00:11:44,038 --> 00:11:45,832
She was like a sister to me.

61
00:11:46,165 --> 00:11:47,876
I tried to help her...

62
00:11:48,042 --> 00:11:51,588
but only succeeded
in driving her away.

63
00:11:52,297 --> 00:11:55,174
She hunted Trask
across the world.

64
00:11:55,508 --> 00:11:58,862
And at the Paris
Peace Accords in 1973,

65
00:11:58,887 --> 00:12:00,138
<i>after the Vietnam War...</i>

66
00:12:00,972 --> 00:12:02,348
<i>she found Trask...</i>

67
00:12:05,435 --> 00:12:06,978
and killed him.

68
00:12:13,151 --> 00:12:14,861
<i>It was the first
time she killed.</i>

69
00:12:14,986 --> 00:12:16,571
It wasn't her last.

70
00:12:16,738 --> 00:12:20,491
But killing Trask did not have
the outcome she expected.

71
00:12:20,617 --> 00:12:22,468
It only persuaded the government

72
00:12:22,493 --> 00:12:24,662
of the need for his program.

73
00:12:24,871 --> 00:12:27,040
They captured her that day...

74
00:12:27,206 --> 00:12:30,001
tortured her,
experimented on her.

75
00:12:30,835 --> 00:12:33,563
<i>In her DNA,
they discovered the secrets</i>

76
00:12:33,588 --> 00:12:35,381
<i>to her powers of transformation.</i>

77
00:12:35,548 --> 00:12:37,592
<i>It gave them
the key they needed...</i>

78
00:12:37,717 --> 00:12:41,721
<i>to create weapons that could
adapt to any mutant power.</i>

79
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,140
<i>And in less than 50 years...</i>

80
00:12:44,307 --> 00:12:46,476
<i>the machines that
have destroyed...</i>

81
00:12:46,601 --> 00:12:50,396
<i>so many of our kind were created.</i>

82
00:12:50,521 --> 00:12:54,192
But it all started
that day in 1973...

83
00:12:54,692 --> 00:12:56,069
the day she first killed.

84
00:12:56,361 --> 00:12:58,279
The day she truly became...

85
00:12:58,404 --> 00:12:59,864
Mystique.

86
00:13:01,866 --> 00:13:03,242
You want to go back there.

87
00:13:03,409 --> 00:13:06,704
If I can get to her,
stop the assassination...

88
00:13:06,829 --> 00:13:08,247
keep her out of their hands...

89
00:13:08,373 --> 00:13:11,834
then we can stop the Sentinels
from ever being born.

90
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:15,213
And end this war
before it ever begins.

91
00:13:19,467 --> 00:13:22,261
Uh, I can send someone
back a couple weeks.

92
00:13:22,887 --> 00:13:24,238
Maybe a month.

93
00:13:24,263 --> 00:13:27,617
But you're talking about
going back decades.

94
00:13:27,642 --> 00:13:30,520
You have the most powerful brain
in the world, Professor...

95
00:13:31,229 --> 00:13:34,899
but the mind can only stretch
so far before it snaps.

96
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,486
It would rip you apart.
I'm sorry.

97
00:13:38,903 --> 00:13:40,822
No one could survive that trip.

98
00:13:41,197 --> 00:13:44,242
What if someone's mind
has a way of snapping back?

99
00:13:45,743 --> 00:13:48,913
What if someone can heal as
fast as they're ripped apart?

100
00:14:13,771 --> 00:14:15,106
Okay, spread out.

101
00:14:15,273 --> 00:14:17,442
Take your positions.

102
00:14:31,456 --> 00:14:34,100
So I wake up in my younger
body, God knows where.

103
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:35,293
Then what?

104
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:38,463
You'll need to go to
my house and find me.

105
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:41,274
Convince me of all of this.

106
00:14:41,299 --> 00:14:43,109
Won't you be able
to just read my mind?

107
00:14:43,134 --> 00:14:46,345
I didn't have my powers in 1973.

108
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:49,323
Logan, you're going
to have to do for me

109
00:14:49,348 --> 00:14:50,850
what I once did for you.

110
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:53,811
Lead me, guide me.

111
00:14:54,145 --> 00:14:56,439
I was a very different man then.

112
00:14:56,564 --> 00:14:58,733
You'll have to be patient with me.

113
00:14:59,484 --> 00:15:01,986
Patience is my strongest suit.

114
00:15:02,153 --> 00:15:03,296
You'll need me as well.

115
00:15:03,321 --> 00:15:04,363
What?

116
00:15:04,489 --> 00:15:07,341
After Mystique left Charles,
she came with me...

117
00:15:07,366 --> 00:15:10,495
and I set her on
a dangerous path.

118
00:15:10,828 --> 00:15:12,180
A darker path.

119
00:15:12,205 --> 00:15:14,932
It's going to take the two
of us, side by side...

120
00:15:14,957 --> 00:15:17,668
at a time when we couldn't
be further apart.

121
00:15:21,005 --> 00:15:22,340
Great.

122
00:15:23,132 --> 00:15:24,842
So where do I find you?

123
00:15:25,176 --> 00:15:26,677
Well, it's complicated.

124
00:15:30,014 --> 00:15:31,824
Basically, your body
will go to sleep

125
00:15:31,849 --> 00:15:34,077
while your mind
travels back in time.

126
00:15:34,102 --> 00:15:35,262
As long as you're back there,

127
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:38,397
past and present will
continue to coexist.

128
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:40,191
But once you wake up...

129
00:15:41,526 --> 00:15:44,237
whatever you've done will
take hold and become history.

130
00:15:44,529 --> 00:15:47,507
And for the rest of us, it will
be the only history that we know.

131
00:15:47,532 --> 00:15:50,910
It will be like the last
50 years never happened.

132
00:15:51,369 --> 00:15:53,579
And this world, and this war...

133
00:15:53,746 --> 00:15:57,125
the only person who will
remember it is you.

134
00:15:59,001 --> 00:16:00,061
All right, Logan...

135
00:16:00,086 --> 00:16:01,604
I need you to clear your head

136
00:16:01,629 --> 00:16:03,356
and to stay as calm as possible.

137
00:16:03,381 --> 00:16:04,941
What? What do you mean?

138
00:16:04,966 --> 00:16:07,401
If your mind gets rocky, it will
be harder for me to hold you...

139
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:09,862
and you could start to slip
between past and future.

140
00:16:09,887 --> 00:16:11,889
What if I need to
get a little rocky?

141
00:16:13,015 --> 00:16:14,367
Think peaceful thoughts?

142
00:16:14,392 --> 00:16:17,311
Peaceful thoughts...
Do you have any good news?

143
00:16:17,478 --> 00:16:20,164
Well, you don't really age,

144
00:16:20,189 --> 00:16:21,589
so you'll pretty
much look the same.

145
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,460
You won't have
much time in the past.

146
00:16:24,485 --> 00:16:26,087
The Sentinels will find us.

147
00:16:26,112 --> 00:16:27,446
They always do.

148
00:16:27,613 --> 00:16:29,240
And this time,
we won't be able to run.

149
00:16:29,407 --> 00:16:30,950
We'll have no escape.

150
00:16:32,243 --> 00:16:34,287
This is our last chance.

151
00:16:34,745 --> 00:16:36,722
You really think this will work?

152
00:16:36,747 --> 00:16:38,583
I have faith in him.

153
00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:40,726
It's not him I'm
worried about, it's us.

154
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:42,311
We were young...

155
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:43,921
we didn't know any better.

156
00:16:44,922 --> 00:16:47,425
We will now.

157
00:16:48,467 --> 00:16:49,802
See you all soon.

158
00:16:49,969 --> 00:16:51,929
This might sting a little.

159
00:17:41,812 --> 00:17:44,523
<i>The first time</i>

160
00:17:47,318 --> 00:17:50,796
<i>Ever I saw your face</i>

161
00:17:52,198 --> 00:17:53,407
Whoa.

162
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:01,916
<i>I thought the sun</i>

163
00:18:03,459 --> 00:18:04,560
<i>Rose in your eyes</i>

164
00:18:14,637 --> 00:18:20,184
<i>And the moon and the stars</i>

165
00:18:23,604 --> 00:18:28,167
<i>Were the gifts you gave</i>

166
00:18:28,192 --> 00:18:29,652
Holy shit.

167
00:18:37,618 --> 00:18:39,328
It worked.

168
00:18:43,874 --> 00:18:45,184
Hey, what's going on?

169
00:18:45,209 --> 00:18:47,395
- Gwen, get dressed.
- Who the hell are you?

170
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:48,604
Hey, I don't know
what's going on.

171
00:18:48,629 --> 00:18:50,022
You're supposed to be

172
00:18:50,047 --> 00:18:51,257
guarding the boss's daughter,
not screwing her.

173
00:18:51,382 --> 00:18:53,259
Well, I didn't sleep with her.

174
00:18:53,384 --> 00:18:55,052
No?
No.

175
00:18:55,761 --> 00:18:58,531
I mean, yes, I slept
with her many times.

176
00:18:58,556 --> 00:18:59,865
Jimmy!

177
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:02,451
That wasn't me.
That was the old me.

178
00:19:02,476 --> 00:19:05,204
I just got here 20 seconds ago.

179
00:19:05,229 --> 00:19:06,289
Really?

180
00:19:06,314 --> 00:19:07,373
Then what happened
to your clothes?

181
00:19:07,398 --> 00:19:08,941
My... Oh.

182
00:19:09,567 --> 00:19:11,043
Would you believe
me if I told you

183
00:19:11,068 --> 00:19:12,570
I was sent here from the future?

184
00:19:12,695 --> 00:19:14,130
Huh?

185
00:19:15,406 --> 00:19:16,924
Get out of here, sweetheart.
Yeah.

186
00:19:16,949 --> 00:19:18,884
- We're gonna take care of this comedian.
- No, you're not.

187
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:21,120
You're gonna give me the keys to
your car and some money for gas...

188
00:19:21,245 --> 00:19:22,471
or you're gonna wake
up in the hospital.

189
00:19:22,496 --> 00:19:24,290
Trust me, I know how
these things play out.

190
00:19:24,415 --> 00:19:26,058
Oh. Because you're
from the future?

191
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:27,126
No.

192
00:19:27,668 --> 00:19:28,919
Because of these.

193
00:19:31,255 --> 00:19:32,715
What the hell?

194
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:39,180
God damn it!

195
00:19:59,116 --> 00:20:01,118
Peaceful thoughts.

196
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:19,528
We are reviewing
all of our defense expenditures...

197
00:20:19,553 --> 00:20:21,597
and all the black books
are being opened.

198
00:20:21,764 --> 00:20:25,684
We can't support a weapon
that targets our own citizens.

199
00:20:25,851 --> 00:20:27,478
If these mutants,
as you describe...

200
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,980
are already living among us...

201
00:20:30,147 --> 00:20:31,982
then they are living
here peacefully.

202
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:33,793
We haven't had an
incident in over 10 years.

203
00:20:33,818 --> 00:20:35,152
After what happened in Cuba?

204
00:20:35,277 --> 00:20:36,612
That was never confirmed.

205
00:20:36,779 --> 00:20:38,989
We have very real
enemies out there...

206
00:20:39,156 --> 00:20:40,549
the Russians, the Chinese.

207
00:20:40,574 --> 00:20:43,661
We are talking about
a tenth of a tenth...

208
00:20:43,828 --> 00:20:45,871
of a tenth of our population.

209
00:20:46,038 --> 00:20:48,432
Allow me to read
something to you.

210
00:20:48,457 --> 00:20:49,642
Please.

211
00:20:49,667 --> 00:20:52,545
This was acquired by
our friends at the CIA.

212
00:20:52,711 --> 00:20:54,021
It's a dissertation...

213
00:20:54,046 --> 00:20:57,800
written by a mutant
at Oxford University.

214
00:20:58,592 --> 00:20:59,969
And I quote...

215
00:21:00,428 --> 00:21:02,304
"To Homo Neanderthalensis..."

216
00:21:02,471 --> 00:21:04,682
"his mutant cousin,
Homo Sapiens..."

217
00:21:05,141 --> 00:21:06,475
"which is us..."

218
00:21:06,642 --> 00:21:08,644
"was an aberration."

219
00:21:08,811 --> 00:21:11,939
"The arrival of the mutated
human species, Homo Sapiens..."

220
00:21:12,106 --> 00:21:16,444
"was followed by the immediate
extinction of their less evolved kin."

221
00:21:17,069 --> 00:21:18,070
Well...

222
00:21:18,654 --> 00:21:23,075
Now, we are the Neanderthal.

223
00:21:23,242 --> 00:21:25,052
Speak for yourself,
Dr. Trask.

224
00:21:27,163 --> 00:21:29,874
You know, when you sent our
soldiers to Vietnam...

225
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,667
without the weapons they
needed to win the war...

226
00:21:31,834 --> 00:21:33,752
you underestimated your enemy.

227
00:21:33,878 --> 00:21:37,273
You do that with this enemy...

228
00:21:37,298 --> 00:21:38,524
Mmm...

229
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:41,552
and it won't be some border
skirmish halfway around the world.

230
00:21:41,719 --> 00:21:43,888
This time, the war will
be for our streets...

231
00:21:44,054 --> 00:21:46,265
our cities, our homes...

232
00:21:46,432 --> 00:21:50,478
and by the time you see the
need for my program...

233
00:21:50,811 --> 00:21:52,938
it will be too late...

234
00:21:53,105 --> 00:21:57,735
and you will have lost
two wars in one lifetime.

235
00:22:00,654 --> 00:22:02,781
We are sorry,
Dr. Trask...

236
00:22:03,199 --> 00:22:05,534
but your Sentinel Program...

237
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,162
it ain't gonna fly.

238
00:22:20,758 --> 00:22:21,984
Can I help you, Colonel?

239
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:24,303
Just here to give our
boys a proper send-off.

240
00:22:24,428 --> 00:22:27,765
I'm sorry, sir, but we have orders.
This is a quarantined area.

241
00:22:27,932 --> 00:22:29,934
Stand aside, soldier.

242
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,977
That's an order.

243
00:22:41,111 --> 00:22:42,112
Atten-hut!

244
00:22:43,113 --> 00:22:44,198
At ease.

245
00:23:07,638 --> 00:23:08,948
What is all this?

246
00:23:08,973 --> 00:23:10,558
Lab reports, blood tests.

247
00:23:10,975 --> 00:23:12,451
It's all getting packed up
and shipped back.

248
00:23:12,476 --> 00:23:13,661
Where is it going?

249
00:23:13,686 --> 00:23:14,728
Same place they are.

250
00:23:15,521 --> 00:23:16,814
Trask Industries.

251
00:23:18,357 --> 00:23:20,000
Let's go, gentlemen.

252
00:23:20,025 --> 00:23:22,319
I'm taking you out
of this shit show.

253
00:23:22,486 --> 00:23:24,321
Shipping home?

254
00:23:25,364 --> 00:23:26,532
Not just yet.

255
00:23:27,241 --> 00:23:28,801
What are you doing with those?

256
00:23:28,826 --> 00:23:30,619
Something to make the ride
a little smoother.

257
00:23:30,869 --> 00:23:33,205
I'm transferring you
to a private facility...

258
00:23:33,831 --> 00:23:35,708
where we can run
a few more tests.

259
00:23:41,338 --> 00:23:42,756
Your men are not military.

260
00:23:44,091 --> 00:23:45,092
Private outfit.

261
00:23:45,551 --> 00:23:47,052
We're authorized
to remand these men.

262
00:23:47,261 --> 00:23:48,262
Hmm.

263
00:23:51,682 --> 00:23:53,434
These troops are going home.

264
00:23:53,601 --> 00:23:57,605
Well, Colonel, I don't believe you
have jurisdiction in this matter.

265
00:23:58,522 --> 00:24:00,858
I'm afraid I do, son.

266
00:24:01,025 --> 00:24:02,151
I'm sorry, who are you?

267
00:24:02,776 --> 00:24:04,445
The question is, Major...

268
00:24:08,699 --> 00:24:09,700
...who are you?

269
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,205
Raven!

270
00:24:56,622 --> 00:24:57,998
That's not my name.

271
00:25:03,587 --> 00:25:05,589
I had that.

272
00:25:05,756 --> 00:25:06,840
I know.

273
00:25:08,676 --> 00:25:10,636
Let's move out.
Come on, let's go.

274
00:25:10,803 --> 00:25:11,970
Where's Erik?

275
00:25:12,137 --> 00:25:13,222
I'm on my own now.

276
00:25:16,684 --> 00:25:17,976
Let's go! Move it!

277
00:25:36,745 --> 00:25:38,288
Hold that plane!

278
00:25:38,789 --> 00:25:41,625
Wouldn't wanna leave these boys
in this godforsaken country.

279
00:25:41,792 --> 00:25:42,793
Yes, sir.

280
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,337
You're not coming
with us, are you?

281
00:25:45,796 --> 00:25:47,172
My war's not over.

282
00:25:47,339 --> 00:25:48,882
The enemy is still out there.

283
00:26:12,156 --> 00:26:14,074
The four privates,
where did they go?

284
00:26:14,241 --> 00:26:16,076
They were headed
towards the tarmac.

285
00:27:14,843 --> 00:27:16,220
Can I help you?

286
00:27:16,637 --> 00:27:19,097
Uh... Yeah, what
happened to the school?

287
00:27:19,264 --> 00:27:22,284
The school's been shut for years.
Are you a parent?

288
00:27:22,309 --> 00:27:25,020
I sure as hell
hope not. Who are you?

289
00:27:25,229 --> 00:27:27,231
I'm Hank. Hank McCoy.

290
00:27:27,356 --> 00:27:29,399
I look after the house now.

291
00:27:30,192 --> 00:27:31,502
You're Beast?

292
00:27:31,527 --> 00:27:33,946
Look at you. I guess
you're a late bloomer.

293
00:27:34,071 --> 00:27:35,255
I don't know what
you're talking about,

294
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,865
but I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

295
00:27:37,115 --> 00:27:38,759
So where's the Professor?

296
00:27:38,784 --> 00:27:40,093
There's no professor here.

297
00:27:40,118 --> 00:27:42,246
You're pretty strong
for a scrawny kid.

298
00:27:42,412 --> 00:27:44,765
You sure there's not
a little Beast in there?

299
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:46,558
No, he's not here.
Come on, Beast.

300
00:27:46,583 --> 00:27:48,043
Come on, Beastie.
No.

301
00:27:48,252 --> 00:27:49,878
Hey!

302
00:27:51,421 --> 00:27:52,631
I said the school's closed.

303
00:27:52,756 --> 00:27:54,758
You need to leave. Not
until I see the Professor.

304
00:27:54,925 --> 00:27:57,386
There's no professor here,
I told you that.

305
00:27:57,511 --> 00:28:01,056
Look, kid. You and I are
gonna be good friends.

306
00:28:03,308 --> 00:28:05,269
You just don't know it yet.

307
00:28:07,813 --> 00:28:09,314
Professor!

308
00:28:15,445 --> 00:28:16,655
Professor!

309
00:28:31,712 --> 00:28:33,338
Hank?

310
00:28:33,505 --> 00:28:35,299
What's going on here?

311
00:28:36,633 --> 00:28:37,860
Professor?

312
00:28:37,885 --> 00:28:39,177
Please don't call me that.

313
00:28:39,303 --> 00:28:40,804
Why?
You know this guy?

314
00:28:40,971 --> 00:28:43,323
Yeah, he looks
slightly familiar.

315
00:28:43,348 --> 00:28:45,617
Get off the bloody
chandelier, Hank.

316
00:28:47,436 --> 00:28:48,770
You can walk.

317
00:28:48,937 --> 00:28:50,147
You're a perceptive one.

318
00:28:50,272 --> 00:28:51,815
I thought Erik...

319
00:28:51,982 --> 00:28:53,166
Which makes it
slightly perplexing that

320
00:28:53,191 --> 00:28:55,127
you missed our
sign on the way in.

321
00:28:55,152 --> 00:28:56,461
This is private property,
my friend.

322
00:28:56,486 --> 00:28:58,614
I'm gonna have to ask him
to ask you to leave.

323
00:28:58,739 --> 00:29:00,215
Well.

324
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,159
I'm afraid I can't do that...

325
00:29:04,536 --> 00:29:06,163
because I was sent here for you.

326
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:09,291
Well, tell whoever it was
that sent you that I'm busy.

327
00:29:10,208 --> 00:29:11,528
That's gonna be
a little tricky...

328
00:29:12,002 --> 00:29:15,339
because the person
who sent me was you.

329
00:29:15,505 --> 00:29:16,565
What?

330
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:18,258
About 50 years from now.

331
00:29:18,425 --> 00:29:19,905
Like in the future,
50 years from now?

332
00:29:19,927 --> 00:29:20,986
Yeah.

333
00:29:21,011 --> 00:29:22,930
I sent you from the future?
Yeah.

334
00:29:23,513 --> 00:29:24,640
Piss off.

335
00:29:25,849 --> 00:29:28,435
If you had your powers, you'd
know I was telling the truth.

336
00:29:28,602 --> 00:29:31,229
How do you know
I don't have my p...

337
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,123
- Who are you?
- I told you.

338
00:29:33,148 --> 00:29:34,666
Are you CIA?
No.

339
00:29:34,691 --> 00:29:35,692
You've been watching me?

340
00:29:35,817 --> 00:29:37,544
I know you, Charles.

341
00:29:37,569 --> 00:29:39,571
We've been friends for years.

342
00:29:39,947 --> 00:29:41,698
I know your powers
came when you were 9.

343
00:29:42,532 --> 00:29:44,576
I know you thought you were
going crazy when it started...

344
00:29:44,743 --> 00:29:46,845
all the voices in your head.

345
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:48,472
And it wasn't
until you were 12...

346
00:29:48,497 --> 00:29:52,000
that you realized all the voices
were in everyone else's head.

347
00:29:52,167 --> 00:29:54,378
Do you want me to go on?

348
00:29:55,545 --> 00:29:57,105
I never told anyone that.

349
00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:00,759
Not yet, no, but, you will.

350
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:03,487
All right,
you've piqued my interest.

351
00:30:03,512 --> 00:30:05,097
What do you want?

352
00:30:05,263 --> 00:30:07,349
We have to stop Raven.

353
00:30:09,685 --> 00:30:11,603
I need your help.

354
00:30:12,729 --> 00:30:14,523
We need your help.

355
00:30:18,735 --> 00:30:20,821
I think I'd like to wake up now.

356
00:30:25,909 --> 00:30:27,995
What does she
have to do with this?

357
00:30:32,207 --> 00:30:33,934
<i>So you're saying...</i>

358
00:30:33,959 --> 00:30:36,169
they took Raven's
power, and what?

359
00:30:36,503 --> 00:30:38,714
They weaponized it?

360
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,881
Yep.

361
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:42,092
She is unique.

362
00:30:42,259 --> 00:30:44,177
Yeah, she is, Hank.

363
00:30:44,344 --> 00:30:47,322
In the beginning, the Sentinels
were just targeting mutants.

364
00:30:47,347 --> 00:30:50,225
Then they began to identify the
genetics in non-mutants...

365
00:30:51,601 --> 00:30:54,980
who would eventually have mutant
children and grandchildren.

366
00:30:55,522 --> 00:30:58,525
Many of the humans tried to help
us, but it was a slaughter.

367
00:30:58,942 --> 00:31:01,695
Leaving only the worst
of humanity in charge.

368
00:31:01,862 --> 00:31:03,822
I've been in a lot of wars.

369
00:31:05,949 --> 00:31:07,826
I'd never seen
anything like this.

370
00:31:08,618 --> 00:31:10,178
And it all starts with her.

371
00:31:10,203 --> 00:31:12,664
Let's just say
for the sake of...

372
00:31:13,665 --> 00:31:16,418
the sake, that I
choose to believe you...

373
00:31:16,585 --> 00:31:19,629
that I choose to help you.
Raven won't listen to me.

374
00:31:21,798 --> 00:31:25,719
Her heart and soul
belong to someone else now.

375
00:31:26,136 --> 00:31:27,220
I know.

376
00:31:29,097 --> 00:31:31,725
That's why we're
gonna need Magneto, too.

377
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,102
Erik?

378
00:31:34,644 --> 00:31:36,063
You do know where he is?
Yeah.

379
00:31:42,611 --> 00:31:43,862
He's where he belongs.

380
00:31:44,946 --> 00:31:46,506
You're just gonna walk out?

381
00:31:46,531 --> 00:31:49,176
Ooh, top marks. Like I
said, you are perceptive.

382
00:31:49,201 --> 00:31:51,121
The Professor I know would
never turn his back...

383
00:31:51,244 --> 00:31:53,163
on someone who'd
lost their path.

384
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:55,332
Especially someone he loved.

385
00:31:57,751 --> 00:31:59,086
You know...

386
00:31:59,252 --> 00:32:01,379
I think I do remember you now.

387
00:32:01,546 --> 00:32:03,815
Yeah. We came to
you a long time ago...

388
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,967
seeking your help.

389
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:09,971
And I'm gonna say to you
what you said to us then.

390
00:32:11,723 --> 00:32:12,933
Fuck off.

391
00:32:13,433 --> 00:32:14,726
Listen to me, you little shit.

392
00:32:15,227 --> 00:32:18,355
I've come a long way, and I've
watched a lot of people die.

393
00:32:18,522 --> 00:32:20,190
Good people. Friends.

394
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,733
If you're gonna
wallow in self-pity...

395
00:32:21,858 --> 00:32:23,752
and do nothing, then you're
gonna watch the same thing...

396
00:32:23,777 --> 00:32:25,445
you understand?

397
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,202
We all have to die sometime.

398
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:38,917
Told you there was
no professor here.

399
00:32:41,169 --> 00:32:43,004
What the hell happened to him?

400
00:32:46,925 --> 00:32:48,927
<i>He lost everything.</i>

401
00:32:49,094 --> 00:32:51,513
<i>Erik, Raven...</i>

402
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,473
<i>his legs.</i>

403
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:56,518
<i>We built the school,
the labs, this whole place...</i>

404
00:32:56,726 --> 00:33:00,438
then, just after
the first semester...

405
00:33:00,605 --> 00:33:02,190
the war in Vietnam got worse.

406
00:33:03,275 --> 00:33:04,776
Many of the teachers...

407
00:33:05,193 --> 00:33:07,779
and older students were drafted.

408
00:33:08,155 --> 00:33:09,489
It broke him.

409
00:33:09,948 --> 00:33:12,284
<i>He retreated into himself.</i>

410
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:14,703
<i>I wanted to help,
do something...</i>

411
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:16,913
<i>so I designed a serum
to treat his spine...</i>

412
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:21,126
<i>derived from the same formula that
helps me control my mutation.</i>

413
00:33:22,377 --> 00:33:25,088
I take just enough
to keep myself balanced...

414
00:33:26,756 --> 00:33:28,216
but he takes too much.

415
00:33:28,633 --> 00:33:30,635
I tried easing him back...

416
00:33:30,802 --> 00:33:34,306
but he just couldn't bear
the pain, the voices.

417
00:33:34,472 --> 00:33:36,933
The treatment
gives him his legs...

418
00:33:37,684 --> 00:33:39,603
but it's not enough.

419
00:33:39,811 --> 00:33:40,812
He's...

420
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,108
He's just lost too much.

421
00:33:58,330 --> 00:33:59,956
<i>You're not scared of me?</i>

422
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:04,044
<i>I always believed I
couldn't be the only one in the world.</i>

423
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,087
<i>Charles Xavier.</i>

424
00:34:08,798 --> 00:34:09,966
Raven.

425
00:34:11,343 --> 00:34:13,053
You're hungry and alone.

426
00:34:13,428 --> 00:34:14,946
Take whatever you want.

427
00:34:14,971 --> 00:34:17,891
We've got lots of food.
You don't have to steal.

428
00:34:18,892 --> 00:34:20,101
In fact...

429
00:34:20,268 --> 00:34:22,771
<i>you never have to steal again.</i>

430
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:25,106
<i>And that's a promise.</i>

431
00:34:30,654 --> 00:34:32,697
I'll help you get her.

432
00:34:34,282 --> 00:34:37,577
Not for any of your future
shite, but for her.

433
00:34:37,744 --> 00:34:38,912
Fair enough.

434
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,207
But I'll tell you this.
You don't know Erik.

435
00:34:42,415 --> 00:34:45,001
That man is a monster.
A murderer.

436
00:34:45,126 --> 00:34:47,938
You think you can
convince Raven to change?

437
00:34:47,963 --> 00:34:49,089
To come home?

438
00:34:49,506 --> 00:34:50,924
That's splendid.

439
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,344
But what makes you think
you can change him?

440
00:34:54,511 --> 00:34:58,098
Because you and Erik sent
me back here together.

441
00:35:00,934 --> 00:35:02,494
<i>The room they're holding him in</i>

442
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:03,812
<i>was built during
the Second World War...</i>

443
00:35:03,979 --> 00:35:05,580
<i>when there was
a shortage of steel.</i>

444
00:35:05,605 --> 00:35:09,442
<i>So the foundation is pure
concrete and sand. No metal.</i>

445
00:35:09,609 --> 00:35:10,694
He's being held...

446
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:13,071
a hundred floors
beneath the most

447
00:35:13,196 --> 00:35:15,448
heavily guarded
building on the planet.

448
00:35:15,615 --> 00:35:16,992
Why is he in there?

449
00:35:18,702 --> 00:35:19,953
What, he forgot to mention?

450
00:35:22,122 --> 00:35:23,164
Uh, JFK.

451
00:35:23,581 --> 00:35:24,683
He killed...

452
00:35:25,959 --> 00:35:29,629
What else explains a bullet
miraculously curving through the air?

453
00:35:29,796 --> 00:35:31,423
Erik's always had
a way with guns.

454
00:35:31,548 --> 00:35:33,275
Are you sure you want
to carry on with this?

455
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,734
This is your plan, not mine.

456
00:35:34,759 --> 00:35:36,903
We don't have any
resources to get us in.

457
00:35:36,928 --> 00:35:38,596
Or out.

458
00:35:39,222 --> 00:35:40,849
It's just me and Hank.

459
00:35:41,016 --> 00:35:42,350
I knew a guy.

460
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:43,977
Yeah, he'd be a young man now.

461
00:35:44,102 --> 00:35:47,397
Grew up outside of D.C.

462
00:35:47,522 --> 00:35:49,107
He could get into anywhere.

463
00:35:49,274 --> 00:35:51,818
I just don't know how the hell
we're gonna find him.

464
00:35:53,153 --> 00:35:55,822
Is Cerebro out of the question?

465
00:35:58,408 --> 00:36:00,618
We have a phonebook.

466
00:36:06,958 --> 00:36:09,252
I thought you'd be getting
ready for your trip, sir.

467
00:36:09,419 --> 00:36:11,296
I just came to
grab a couple files.

468
00:36:11,463 --> 00:36:14,883
Is that a new scarf?
It's nice.

469
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:16,134
Thank you.

470
00:37:47,434 --> 00:37:48,743
Dr. Trask?

471
00:37:48,768 --> 00:37:49,853
One second.

472
00:37:50,937 --> 00:37:52,163
Oh.

473
00:37:52,188 --> 00:37:54,691
We added some names
to the Paris meeting.

474
00:37:58,194 --> 00:37:59,446
Thank you.

475
00:38:00,613 --> 00:38:01,948
Is something wrong, sir?

476
00:38:02,907 --> 00:38:05,034
No. It's nothing.

477
00:38:05,368 --> 00:38:07,954
Would you mind
typing up my itinerary?

478
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,123
I don't wanna miss anything.

479
00:38:18,423 --> 00:38:19,983
- Here, here, here.
- Where?

480
00:38:20,008 --> 00:38:21,448
Just stop here.
All right, all right.

481
00:38:21,593 --> 00:38:23,720
Next time I'm driving.
Don't get used to it.

482
00:38:41,404 --> 00:38:43,256
What's he done now?

483
00:38:43,281 --> 00:38:45,033
I will just write you a
check for whatever he took.

484
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,451
We just need to talk to him.

485
00:38:48,995 --> 00:38:53,391
Peter! The cops
are here. Again.

486
00:39:00,381 --> 00:39:01,501
What do you guys want?

487
00:39:01,633 --> 00:39:04,302
I didn't do anything.
I've been here all day.

488
00:39:05,428 --> 00:39:07,388
Just relax, Peter.
We're not cops.

489
00:39:07,555 --> 00:39:08,656
Of course you're not.
If you were,

490
00:39:08,681 --> 00:39:09,766
you wouldn't be
driving a rental car.

491
00:39:09,933 --> 00:39:10,934
How did you know
we've got a rental car?

492
00:39:11,059 --> 00:39:12,936
I checked your registration when
you were walking to the door.

493
00:39:13,061 --> 00:39:14,078
I also had some time to kill

494
00:39:14,103 --> 00:39:15,104
so I went through
your rental agreement.

495
00:39:15,271 --> 00:39:17,357
Saw you were from out of town.
Are you FBI?

496
00:39:18,316 --> 00:39:20,443
No, you're not cops. Hey, what's
with this gifted youngsters place?

497
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:22,946
That's an old card.

498
00:39:24,197 --> 00:39:26,199
He's fascinating.
He's a pain in the arse.

499
00:39:26,366 --> 00:39:27,534
What, a teleporter?

500
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:28,785
No, he's just fast.

501
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:31,329
And when I knew him
he wasn't so... young.

502
00:39:32,163 --> 00:39:33,998
Young?
You're just old.

503
00:39:34,999 --> 00:39:36,876
So you're not afraid
to show your powers?

504
00:39:37,043 --> 00:39:38,603
What powers? What
are you talking about?

505
00:39:39,379 --> 00:39:40,838
Do you see
something strange here?

506
00:39:42,006 --> 00:39:44,133
Nothing anybody would
believe if you told them.

507
00:39:48,263 --> 00:39:49,864
So, who are you?
What do you want?

508
00:39:49,889 --> 00:39:51,558
We need your help, Peter.
For what?

509
00:39:51,724 --> 00:39:53,768
To break into a highly
secured facility...

510
00:39:54,185 --> 00:39:55,478
and to get someone out.

511
00:39:55,645 --> 00:39:56,688
Prison break?

512
00:39:57,355 --> 00:39:58,523
That's illegal, you know.

513
00:39:58,815 --> 00:39:59,816
Um...

514
00:40:02,902 --> 00:40:04,737
Well, only if you get caught.

515
00:40:04,904 --> 00:40:06,005
So, what's in it for me?

516
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:09,409
You, you kleptomaniac, get
to break into the Pentagon.

517
00:40:15,331 --> 00:40:17,000
How do I know I can trust you?

518
00:40:18,001 --> 00:40:19,502
Because we're just like you.

519
00:40:21,796 --> 00:40:23,006
Show him.

520
00:40:34,892 --> 00:40:36,853
That's cool,
but it's disgusting.

521
00:40:38,688 --> 00:40:43,484
Built in 1943, the Pentagon
is the world's largest office building...

522
00:40:43,651 --> 00:40:46,529
housing more than
25,000 military employees...

523
00:40:46,696 --> 00:40:48,339
stretched over six
million square feet.

524
00:40:48,364 --> 00:40:49,365
Where's the bathroom?

525
00:40:49,866 --> 00:40:52,285
He always needs to pee!

526
00:41:55,264 --> 00:41:57,575
Yeah, we're getting broadcast
signal down here. What's going on?

527
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,435
Damn it, call Maintenance,
get them down here.

528
00:43:36,365 --> 00:43:40,161
...fought for and captured the island
of Iwo Jima from the Japanese Empire.

529
00:43:40,828 --> 00:43:42,205
Now, this month-long battle...

530
00:43:42,371 --> 00:43:43,915
included some of
the fiercest fighting

531
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,583
during World War
II in the Pacific...

532
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:03,726
In three seconds, those
doors are going to open...

533
00:44:03,893 --> 00:44:06,229
and 20 guards will
be here to shoot us.

534
00:44:07,271 --> 00:44:09,123
I know. That's what
I'm waiting for.

535
00:44:09,148 --> 00:44:10,291
What are you doing?

536
00:44:10,316 --> 00:44:12,043
I'm holding your neck so
you don't get whiplash.

537
00:44:12,068 --> 00:44:13,069
What?

538
00:44:13,194 --> 00:44:15,404
Whiplash.

539
00:44:19,909 --> 00:44:21,244
Don't move!

540
00:44:36,259 --> 00:44:37,568
You're good, it'll pass.

541
00:44:37,593 --> 00:44:38,761
It happens with everyone.

542
00:44:41,264 --> 00:44:43,432
You must have done
something pretty serious.

543
00:44:43,558 --> 00:44:45,034
What did you do, man?

544
00:44:45,059 --> 00:44:46,619
What did you do?

545
00:44:46,644 --> 00:44:48,412
What did you do? Why'd
they have you in there?

546
00:44:48,437 --> 00:44:50,231
For killing the President.

547
00:44:51,023 --> 00:44:54,193
Ah. Wow.
Shit.

548
00:44:54,986 --> 00:44:56,712
The only thing I'm guilty of

549
00:44:56,737 --> 00:44:58,322
is fighting for people like us.

550
00:44:58,489 --> 00:45:00,424
You take karate?
You know karate, man?

551
00:45:00,449 --> 00:45:02,577
I don't know karate.

552
00:45:02,743 --> 00:45:04,053
But I know crazy.

553
00:45:05,162 --> 00:45:08,057
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and
girls, this is a Code Red situation.

554
00:45:08,082 --> 00:45:10,142
We are evacuating
the entire floor...

555
00:45:10,167 --> 00:45:12,937
so that my associate and I...

556
00:45:12,962 --> 00:45:14,647
can, uh, secure the prison.

557
00:45:14,672 --> 00:45:16,173
Who are you?

558
00:45:16,299 --> 00:45:17,842
We're special operations, CB...

559
00:45:17,967 --> 00:45:19,318
FB-CID.

560
00:45:19,343 --> 00:45:22,238
Perhaps you didn't hear me
when first I spoke...

561
00:45:22,263 --> 00:45:24,156
but it is imperative
that you understand...

562
00:45:24,181 --> 00:45:25,783
we're in a complete
lockdown situation.

563
00:45:25,808 --> 00:45:27,535
We have to get you
to the third floor...

564
00:45:34,525 --> 00:45:36,569
Oh, I'm sorry.
Were you finished?

565
00:45:41,782 --> 00:45:43,659
They told me you control metal.

566
00:45:44,035 --> 00:45:45,244
"They"?

567
00:45:48,205 --> 00:45:51,417
You know, my mom once knew
a guy who could do that.

568
00:45:54,003 --> 00:45:56,923
I'm sorry, I'm just not
very good with violence.

569
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,302
Charles?

570
00:46:08,017 --> 00:46:09,936
Good to see you too, old friend.

571
00:46:10,102 --> 00:46:11,228
And walking.

572
00:46:11,354 --> 00:46:12,813
No thanks to you.

573
00:46:14,273 --> 00:46:16,734
You're the last person in the
world I expected to see today.

574
00:46:16,901 --> 00:46:18,194
Believe me...

575
00:46:18,361 --> 00:46:20,029
I wouldn't be here
if I didn't have to.

576
00:46:20,363 --> 00:46:22,365
If we get you out of here,
we do it my way.

577
00:46:22,531 --> 00:46:23,532
No killing.

578
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:24,951
No helmet.

579
00:46:25,576 --> 00:46:27,536
I couldn't disobey
you even if I wanted.

580
00:46:27,703 --> 00:46:30,247
I'm never getting
inside of that head again.

581
00:46:31,582 --> 00:46:33,542
I need your word, Erik.

582
00:46:36,754 --> 00:46:37,880
Nobody move!

583
00:46:38,381 --> 00:46:40,383
Hold it right there!

584
00:46:42,426 --> 00:46:44,095
- Charles.
- Don't move.

585
00:46:44,261 --> 00:46:46,263
Hands up, or we will shoot!

586
00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:48,115
Freeze them, Charles.
I can't.

587
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:49,433
Hands up!

588
00:46:54,105 --> 00:46:55,189
No!

589
00:47:08,077 --> 00:47:12,289
<i>If I could save time in a bottle</i>

590
00:47:13,582 --> 00:47:18,521
<i>The first thing
that I'd like to do</i>

591
00:47:18,546 --> 00:47:21,232
<i>Is to save every day</i>

592
00:47:21,257 --> 00:47:25,111
<i>Till eternity passes away</i>

593
00:47:25,136 --> 00:47:28,097
<i>Just to spend them with you</i>

594
00:47:29,348 --> 00:47:33,602
<i>If I could make days
last forever</i>

595
00:47:34,687 --> 00:47:38,274
<i>If words could make
wishes come true</i>

596
00:47:39,859 --> 00:47:42,503
<i>I'd save every day</i>

597
00:47:42,528 --> 00:47:45,423
<i>Like a treasure and then</i>

598
00:47:45,448 --> 00:47:49,827
<i>Again,
I would spend them with you</i>

599
00:47:50,536 --> 00:47:53,723
<i>But there never seems
to be enough time</i>

600
00:47:53,748 --> 00:47:56,225
<i>To do the things you want to do</i>

601
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:58,919
<i>Once you find them</i>

602
00:48:01,797 --> 00:48:04,191
<i>I've looked around
enough to know</i>

603
00:48:04,216 --> 00:48:08,929
<i>That you're the one I want
to go through time with</i>

604
00:48:48,511 --> 00:48:50,012
Thanks, kid.

605
00:48:54,683 --> 00:48:56,727
Peter,
thank you very, very much.

606
00:48:56,894 --> 00:48:57,895
You take care.

607
00:48:58,062 --> 00:48:59,371
Hey, I saw your
flight plan in the cockpit.

608
00:48:59,396 --> 00:49:00,476
Why are you going to Paris?

609
00:49:12,034 --> 00:49:13,786
Imagine if they were metal.

610
00:49:15,204 --> 00:49:17,014
Do me a favor and return it for me.
Okay.

611
00:49:17,039 --> 00:49:18,374
And, Peter?

612
00:49:18,874 --> 00:49:20,184
Take it slow.

613
00:49:21,252 --> 00:49:23,129
Where did they dig you up?

614
00:49:24,421 --> 00:49:26,715
You're gonna find
this hard to believe...

615
00:49:27,967 --> 00:49:29,718
but, uh, you sent me.

616
00:49:29,885 --> 00:49:32,054
You and Charles.

617
00:49:32,221 --> 00:49:33,806
From the future.

618
00:49:56,245 --> 00:49:58,414
How did you lose them?

619
00:49:58,581 --> 00:50:00,833
The treatment for my
spine affects my DNA.

620
00:50:03,669 --> 00:50:06,172
You sacrificed your powers
so you could walk?

621
00:50:07,006 --> 00:50:10,176
I sacrificed my powers
so that I could sleep.

622
00:50:12,636 --> 00:50:13,762
What do you know about it?

623
00:50:13,929 --> 00:50:15,239
I've lost my fair share.

624
00:50:15,264 --> 00:50:16,265
Ha.

625
00:50:16,682 --> 00:50:18,434
Dry your eyes, Erik.

626
00:50:18,601 --> 00:50:20,269
It doesn't justify
what you've done.

627
00:50:20,436 --> 00:50:22,104
You have no idea what I've done.

628
00:50:22,271 --> 00:50:23,939
I know that you took the things
that mean the most to me.

629
00:50:24,273 --> 00:50:26,584
Well, maybe you should have
fought harder for them.

630
00:50:26,609 --> 00:50:27,960
If you want a fight, Erik...

631
00:50:27,985 --> 00:50:29,587
Sit down.
...I will give you a fight!

632
00:50:29,612 --> 00:50:30,796
Let him come.

633
00:50:30,821 --> 00:50:32,631
You abandoned me!

634
00:50:32,656 --> 00:50:33,924
You took her away...

635
00:50:33,949 --> 00:50:35,034
and you abandoned me!

636
00:50:35,201 --> 00:50:36,619
Angel.

637
00:50:36,952 --> 00:50:38,287
Azazel.

638
00:50:38,954 --> 00:50:40,789
Emma.

639
00:50:40,956 --> 00:50:42,333
Banshee.

640
00:50:43,292 --> 00:50:44,960
Mutant brothers and sisters...

641
00:50:45,127 --> 00:50:46,587
all dead!

642
00:50:48,839 --> 00:50:50,608
Countless others...

643
00:50:50,633 --> 00:50:51,734
experimented on.

644
00:50:51,759 --> 00:50:52,860
Butchered!

645
00:50:52,885 --> 00:50:53,944
Erik!

646
00:50:53,969 --> 00:50:55,095
Where were you, Charles?

647
00:50:55,471 --> 00:50:57,765
We were supposed
to protect them!

648
00:50:58,307 --> 00:51:00,643
Where were you when your
own people needed you?

649
00:51:00,809 --> 00:51:02,895
Hiding! You and Hank!

650
00:51:03,312 --> 00:51:05,064
Pretending to be
something you're not!

651
00:51:05,648 --> 00:51:07,024
Erik!

652
00:51:08,859 --> 00:51:11,403
You abandoned us all.

653
00:51:31,548 --> 00:51:33,759
So, you were always an asshole.

654
00:51:36,345 --> 00:51:38,948
I take it we're best
buddies in the future.

655
00:51:40,516 --> 00:51:41,951
I spent a lot of years

656
00:51:41,976 --> 00:51:43,686
trying to bring you down, bub.

657
00:51:44,270 --> 00:51:46,021
How does that work out for you?

658
00:51:46,188 --> 00:51:47,898
You're like me.

659
00:51:49,066 --> 00:51:50,818
You're a survivor.

660
00:51:54,905 --> 00:51:56,265
Do you wanna pick
all that shit up?

661
00:52:15,050 --> 00:52:19,596
General, maybe you should slow down,
we have a big day tomorrow.

662
00:52:20,556 --> 00:52:26,270
We're celebrating, captain. It's not every day you win
a war, let alone against the American devils.

663
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,107
I'm getting another bottle.

664
00:52:47,166 --> 00:52:48,267
Excuse me.

665
00:52:49,418 --> 00:52:51,378
I'm pretty sure it was my fault.

666
00:52:51,754 --> 00:52:53,172
You speak Vietnamese.

667
00:52:53,422 --> 00:52:54,506
I'm an interpreter.

668
00:52:56,508 --> 00:52:59,011
I speak many tongues.

669
00:52:59,762 --> 00:53:01,930
Let me buy you another drink...

670
00:53:02,264 --> 00:53:04,350
unless you're here with someone.

671
00:53:05,059 --> 00:53:07,394
I'm alone.

672
00:53:08,645 --> 00:53:10,939
A bottle of Johnnie Walker please.

673
00:53:25,704 --> 00:53:28,374
You're going to the Summit tomorrow?

674
00:53:33,462 --> 00:53:38,525
A pretty girl interested in politics...

675
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:41,136
Looks can be deceiving.

676
00:53:41,553 --> 00:53:43,013
Lady.

677
00:53:43,806 --> 00:53:47,017
Show me more, baby?

678
00:53:48,811 --> 00:53:51,397
Clothes off?

679
00:54:03,867 --> 00:54:07,871
What's the matter, baby? You don't
think I look pretty like this?

680
00:54:54,418 --> 00:54:57,212
Fancy a game?
It's been a while.

681
00:54:57,379 --> 00:54:59,047
I'm not in the mood
for games, thank you.

682
00:55:05,929 --> 00:55:08,849
I haven't had
a real sip in ten years.

683
00:55:21,653 --> 00:55:22,988
I didn't kill the President.

684
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:26,074
The bullet curved, Erik.

685
00:55:26,241 --> 00:55:27,743
Because I was
trying to save him.

686
00:55:29,286 --> 00:55:30,829
They took me out before I could.

687
00:55:30,996 --> 00:55:32,097
Why would you try and save him?

688
00:55:32,122 --> 00:55:34,750
Because he was one of us.

689
00:55:45,928 --> 00:55:48,347
You must think me so foolish.

690
00:55:49,932 --> 00:55:51,934
We've always said they
would come after us.

691
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:55,437
I never imagined they'd
use Raven's DNA to do it.

692
00:55:56,313 --> 00:55:57,606
When did you last see her?

693
00:56:01,276 --> 00:56:03,153
The day I left for Dallas.

694
00:56:04,154 --> 00:56:05,447
And how was she?

695
00:56:07,449 --> 00:56:08,450
Strong.

696
00:56:09,326 --> 00:56:10,327
Driven.

697
00:56:11,495 --> 00:56:12,596
Loyal.

698
00:56:12,621 --> 00:56:15,374
How... How was she?

699
00:56:17,125 --> 00:56:18,293
She was...

700
00:56:20,045 --> 00:56:21,797
We were...

701
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:27,636
I could see why she
meant so much to you.

702
00:56:30,222 --> 00:56:31,890
You should be proud
of her, Charles.

703
00:56:33,475 --> 00:56:35,352
She's out there
fighting for our cause.

704
00:56:35,519 --> 00:56:36,895
Your cause.

705
00:56:37,688 --> 00:56:40,482
The girl I raised was
not capable of killing.

706
00:56:40,649 --> 00:56:42,150
You didn't raise her,
you grew up with her.

707
00:56:42,317 --> 00:56:44,361
She couldn't stay a little girl
forever, that's why she left.

708
00:56:44,528 --> 00:56:47,406
She left because you
got inside her head.

709
00:56:49,408 --> 00:56:51,326
That's not my power.

710
00:56:53,328 --> 00:56:54,663
She made a choice.

711
00:56:54,830 --> 00:56:57,666
But now we know where
that choice leads, don't we?

712
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,309
She's going to murder Trask,

713
00:56:59,334 --> 00:57:00,574
they're going to capture her...

714
00:57:01,169 --> 00:57:03,422
and then they're
going to wipe us out.

715
00:57:03,589 --> 00:57:05,507
Not if we get to her first.

716
00:57:06,717 --> 00:57:08,927
Not if we change
history tomorrow.

717
00:57:14,433 --> 00:57:16,101
I'm sorry, Charles...

718
00:57:20,522 --> 00:57:21,523
for what happened.

719
00:57:22,357 --> 00:57:23,692
I truly am.

720
00:57:27,779 --> 00:57:29,819
It's been a while since I've played.

721
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:33,577
I'll go easy on you.

722
00:57:35,454 --> 00:57:37,372
Might finally be a fair fight.

723
00:57:38,707 --> 00:57:40,083
You have the first move.

724
00:57:54,222 --> 00:57:56,992
<i>The diplomats from
all around the world</i>

725
00:57:57,017 --> 00:57:59,061
<i>are arriving here
today at the Hotel Royal.</i>

726
00:57:59,227 --> 00:58:00,646
<i>It's an historic day.</i>

727
00:58:00,812 --> 00:58:03,123
<i>It's the, uh, official ending</i>

728
00:58:03,148 --> 00:58:05,901
<i>of the United States' military
involvement in Vietnam.</i>

729
00:58:06,109 --> 00:58:08,236
<i>There we have the South
Vietnamese Foreign Minister...</i>

730
00:58:08,403 --> 00:58:10,072
<i>with other South
Vietnamese dignitaries.</i>

731
00:58:10,989 --> 00:58:13,241
The Summit doesn't begin
for another hour.

732
00:58:13,408 --> 00:58:15,010
The hotel has arranged
a private room

733
00:58:15,035 --> 00:58:16,578
upstairs for
your special guests.

734
00:58:16,745 --> 00:58:18,764
That will be plenty of time.

735
00:58:22,834 --> 00:58:26,797
Good afternoon, everyone.
Hello, thank you for coming.

736
00:58:26,963 --> 00:58:29,591
Congratulations on
winning this war.

737
00:58:30,092 --> 00:58:32,277
Now, I know you all
have hands to shake

738
00:58:32,302 --> 00:58:34,429
and photos to take downstairs...

739
00:58:34,596 --> 00:58:36,640
so I will get
right to the point.

740
00:58:37,432 --> 00:58:39,685
There is a new enemy out there.

741
00:58:39,851 --> 00:58:42,354
An enemy that will render
your arsenals useless...

742
00:58:42,521 --> 00:58:43,814
your armies powerless...

743
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:45,857
and your nations defenseless.

744
00:58:51,613 --> 00:58:55,492
<i>You will need a new weapon for
this war. I call them Sentinels.</i>

745
00:58:57,327 --> 00:58:59,304
Named after
the ancient guardians

746
00:58:59,329 --> 00:59:01,206
that stood at
the gates of the citadel.

747
00:59:03,458 --> 00:59:06,294
They have the aeronautic
capabilities of a Harrier jet.

748
00:59:07,295 --> 00:59:09,631
Armed with guns
that can fire off...

749
00:59:09,798 --> 00:59:13,802
<i>more than 2,000 rounds per minute
of thermoceramic ammunition.</i>

750
00:59:13,969 --> 00:59:16,471
But size, power, speed...

751
00:59:16,638 --> 00:59:18,557
you could find that
at Lockheed or Boeing.

752
00:59:18,724 --> 00:59:21,226
No, what makes the
Sentinels so special...

753
00:59:21,393 --> 00:59:24,855
is the ability to target
the mutant X-gene.

754
00:59:25,021 --> 00:59:26,523
A genetic guidance system

755
00:59:26,648 --> 00:59:29,192
that can lock onto a mark a half a
mile away.

756
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:32,362
It won't trigger unless it
has identified the target.

757
00:59:32,529 --> 00:59:34,423
With this weapon, there will be

758
00:59:34,448 --> 00:59:36,074
no human collateral damage.

759
00:59:36,241 --> 00:59:39,077
If I turn it on, the system
couldn't even activate in here.

760
00:59:46,835 --> 00:59:50,672
Unless there's a mutant.

761
00:59:59,222 --> 01:00:01,933
There has to be
some kind of mistake.

762
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:06,229
My machines don't make mistakes.

763
01:00:08,690 --> 01:00:10,130
What are you?

764
01:00:11,026 --> 01:00:12,778
I assure you...

765
01:00:14,863 --> 01:00:15,903
No, don't shoot it.

766
01:00:16,531 --> 01:00:17,841
I assure you,

767
01:00:17,866 --> 01:00:19,426
I don't know what
you're talking about.

768
01:00:53,819 --> 01:00:54,861
Raven!

769
01:01:00,283 --> 01:01:02,160
Raven? Raven!

770
01:01:06,248 --> 01:01:07,641
Raven?

771
01:01:09,751 --> 01:01:10,919
Charles?

772
01:01:11,086 --> 01:01:13,338
We've come for you, Erik and I.

773
01:01:13,505 --> 01:01:14,506
Together.

774
01:01:15,507 --> 01:01:17,676
I never thought
I'd see you again.

775
01:01:17,843 --> 01:01:20,153
I made you
a promise a long time ago

776
01:01:20,178 --> 01:01:21,304
that I would protect you.

777
01:01:29,062 --> 01:01:30,105
<i>Wolverine!</i>

778
01:01:34,317 --> 01:01:35,527
I'm going to keep you safe.

779
01:01:35,694 --> 01:01:37,320
I'm going to keep you
out of their hands.

780
01:01:41,283 --> 01:01:42,617
Erik?

781
01:01:43,785 --> 01:01:45,954
Erik?
What are you doing?

782
01:01:47,622 --> 01:01:49,165
Securing our future.

783
01:01:49,875 --> 01:01:51,293
Forgive me, Mystique.

784
01:01:51,668 --> 01:01:54,129
As long as you're out
there, we'll never be safe.

785
01:01:55,297 --> 01:01:56,481
Erik...

786
01:01:56,506 --> 01:01:58,508
Use your power,
Charles. Stop him.

787
01:01:58,675 --> 01:01:59,801
He can't.

788
01:02:30,665 --> 01:02:32,167
He's slipping back.

789
01:02:32,334 --> 01:02:33,543
I'm losing him.

790
01:03:15,210 --> 01:03:16,252
<i>Stryker!</i>

791
01:03:16,711 --> 01:03:18,897
<i>Someone will finish
what we've started, Wolverine!</i>

792
01:03:18,922 --> 01:03:20,023
<i>One day!</i>

793
01:03:25,428 --> 01:03:26,429
Restrain him.

794
01:03:41,569 --> 01:03:42,570
Erik!

795
01:03:52,747 --> 01:03:53,890
Where am I?

796
01:03:53,915 --> 01:03:54,958
Huh?

797
01:03:56,793 --> 01:03:58,086
How the hell did I get here?

798
01:03:58,253 --> 01:03:59,838
What? You came to us.

799
01:04:00,839 --> 01:04:02,090
Who are you?
Charles.

800
01:04:02,590 --> 01:04:03,817
Charles Xavier!

801
01:04:03,842 --> 01:04:04,901
I don't know you.

802
01:04:04,926 --> 01:04:06,970
Huh?
What the hell is that?

803
01:04:07,095 --> 01:04:10,473
Whoa.Whoa. Look, I can deal with this.
Just go.

804
01:04:10,765 --> 01:04:12,142
Stop Erik!

805
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:13,785
Erik, please...

806
01:04:13,810 --> 01:04:14,936
I'm sorry.

807
01:04:15,103 --> 01:04:16,271
Erik...

808
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:37,333
You're Logan, that's Hank
McCoy, I'm Charles Xavier.

809
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:39,961
You spent the last
couple of days with us.

810
01:04:43,339 --> 01:04:44,966
You're on acid.

811
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:49,846
Somebody gave you
really bad acid, yeah?

812
01:05:34,516 --> 01:05:35,658
Just hold on tight,

813
01:05:35,683 --> 01:05:36,963
we'll get through this together.

814
01:05:38,394 --> 01:05:39,687
Oh, my God, Kitty.

815
01:05:41,856 --> 01:05:42,857
She's wounded pretty bad.

816
01:06:48,173 --> 01:06:49,257
I got him.

817
01:06:54,012 --> 01:06:55,013
Professor?

818
01:06:55,763 --> 01:06:56,848
What happened to you?

819
01:06:58,433 --> 01:06:59,826
I just saw someone who's gonna

820
01:06:59,851 --> 01:07:01,436
bring me a lot of pain someday.

821
01:07:04,272 --> 01:07:05,273
Where's Raven?

822
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:07,192
Gone.
What?

823
01:07:07,358 --> 01:07:09,402
We have to get out of here.

824
01:07:09,736 --> 01:07:11,976
We want to know if there's
any sort of connection with...

825
01:07:18,369 --> 01:07:20,038
<i>Yesterday,
the Paris Peace Summit...</i>

826
01:07:20,205 --> 01:07:22,916
<i>was rocked by the appearance
of unidentified assailants...</i>

827
01:07:23,041 --> 01:07:25,335
<i>the likes of which
the world has never seen.</i>

828
01:07:25,501 --> 01:07:28,213
<i>Mass hysteria has gripped
the nation as people ask...</i>

829
01:07:28,379 --> 01:07:30,632
<i>"Where did they come from?
Will they be back?"</i>

830
01:07:30,798 --> 01:07:33,718
<i>And most importantly,
"Are they friend or foe?"</i>

831
01:07:33,885 --> 01:07:36,888
<i>That was London
correspondent Toby Elliot...</i>

832
01:07:37,013 --> 01:07:38,893
<i>reporting from the
Paris Peace Summit yesterday.</i>

833
01:07:40,058 --> 01:07:42,685
What the hell are we dealing with here?
Off the record.

834
01:07:43,478 --> 01:07:46,856
Two days ago, this
man, Erik Lehnsherr...

835
01:07:47,023 --> 01:07:49,525
escaped from a maximum security
prison inside the Pentagon.

836
01:07:49,692 --> 01:07:51,628
We believe that this woman

837
01:07:51,653 --> 01:07:53,404
is a former associate
of Lehnsherr's.

838
01:07:53,571 --> 01:07:55,131
They were together in Cuba,

839
01:07:55,156 --> 01:07:57,575
the day of the crisis in '62.

840
01:07:57,742 --> 01:08:01,412
He was also implicated
in Kennedy's assassination.

841
01:08:02,538 --> 01:08:03,915
What about that thing?

842
01:08:04,082 --> 01:08:05,583
We don't know what
that thing is, sir.

843
01:08:05,750 --> 01:08:08,044
Actually, we really don't
know what any of them are.

844
01:08:08,211 --> 01:08:10,755
Yes. Yes, we do.

845
01:08:11,589 --> 01:08:13,007
They're mutants.

846
01:08:14,384 --> 01:08:18,346
He has the power
to control metal.

847
01:08:18,513 --> 01:08:19,822
Last I checked, that's what

848
01:08:19,847 --> 01:08:21,349
most of your weapons
were made of.

849
01:08:21,557 --> 01:08:25,395
And she can transform
into anyone.

850
01:08:25,561 --> 01:08:28,356
A general, a secret serviceman.

851
01:08:28,523 --> 01:08:29,774
Even you,
Mr. President.

852
01:08:30,441 --> 01:08:31,834
She could walk
into this office...

853
01:08:31,859 --> 01:08:35,530
and order a nuclear strike
if she was in the mood.

854
01:08:35,697 --> 01:08:37,282
And that's only two of them.

855
01:08:37,448 --> 01:08:40,451
Do we have any countermeasures?
Any defense?

856
01:08:40,618 --> 01:08:42,870
I was waiting for you
to ask me that question.

857
01:08:43,204 --> 01:08:46,958
That's an experimental program, sir.
Strictly off the books.

858
01:08:55,758 --> 01:08:58,428
You're telling me these mutants
are out in the world...

859
01:08:58,594 --> 01:09:01,055
and our best defense
are these giant metal robots?

860
01:09:01,222 --> 01:09:03,266
Many of the mutants
look like us.

861
01:09:03,725 --> 01:09:05,893
My Sentinels can
tell the difference.

862
01:09:06,144 --> 01:09:08,438
I have eight prototypes
ready to go.

863
01:09:08,604 --> 01:09:10,581
They're built out of
a space-age polymer,

864
01:09:10,606 --> 01:09:12,275
not an ounce of metal on them.

865
01:09:18,906 --> 01:09:20,241
I want to make a demonstration.

866
01:09:20,408 --> 01:09:22,660
I want the world to know
that we can protect them.

867
01:09:23,161 --> 01:09:24,787
What do you need to get
these things operational?

868
01:09:24,954 --> 01:09:26,497
I already gave that
number to Congress.

869
01:09:26,664 --> 01:09:29,417
Unfortunately, they
elected to shut me down.

870
01:09:29,584 --> 01:09:32,170
It's going to cost a bit
more to turn them on.

871
01:09:32,337 --> 01:09:33,438
Whatever you need.

872
01:09:33,463 --> 01:09:35,340
Oh, and one more thing.

873
01:09:35,506 --> 01:09:38,926
If we do manage to capture
them, I would like her.

874
01:09:39,093 --> 01:09:41,012
For research purposes,
of course.

875
01:09:46,851 --> 01:09:48,269
Terrible thing.

876
01:09:49,437 --> 01:09:50,813
What is?

877
01:09:51,272 --> 01:09:52,832
Being born like that.

878
01:09:52,857 --> 01:09:53,983
Is it?

879
01:09:54,317 --> 01:09:56,611
Can you imagine...

880
01:09:56,861 --> 01:09:59,530
Looking in the mirror and seeing that
staring back at you?

881
01:10:00,615 --> 01:10:03,368
Yes, I can.

882
01:10:05,620 --> 01:10:08,247
Where do you think she comes from?

883
01:10:08,498 --> 01:10:11,292
You think she has a family?

884
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:14,504
Yes.

885
01:10:14,670 --> 01:10:16,506
She does.

886
01:11:04,220 --> 01:11:06,322
If I see so much
as a screw move,

887
01:11:06,347 --> 01:11:08,349
I will jam this
into your throat.

888
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:10,685
How did you find me?

889
01:11:10,852 --> 01:11:12,353
You taught me well.

890
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:14,856
It's been a long time
since we were this close.

891
01:11:16,357 --> 01:11:17,733
I missed you.

892
01:11:17,900 --> 01:11:19,569
You tried to kill me.

893
01:11:19,735 --> 01:11:21,863
So the rest of us could live.

894
01:11:23,364 --> 01:11:24,615
What do you mean?

895
01:11:25,199 --> 01:11:27,201
We received a message
from the future.

896
01:11:27,368 --> 01:11:29,287
Don't lie to me.

897
01:11:29,912 --> 01:11:31,914
I never have, and I never will.

898
01:11:33,541 --> 01:11:36,018
Humans use your blood,
your genes,

899
01:11:36,043 --> 01:11:38,421
to create a weapon
that wipes us all out.

900
01:11:38,588 --> 01:11:40,064
I was only doing what I thought

901
01:11:40,089 --> 01:11:42,049
necessary to secure our future.

902
01:11:42,216 --> 01:11:43,568
So what's to stop me
from killing you

903
01:11:43,593 --> 01:11:45,386
right now and
securing my future?

904
01:11:46,429 --> 01:11:47,555
Nothing.

905
01:11:48,806 --> 01:11:50,725
It doesn't matter anymore.

906
01:11:50,892 --> 01:11:53,728
They have your DNA. Your
blood was on the street.

907
01:11:54,395 --> 01:11:55,730
Whose fault was that?

908
01:11:57,398 --> 01:11:58,816
Mine.

909
01:11:59,734 --> 01:12:03,070
I've seen their plans.
They're creating a weapon.

910
01:12:03,237 --> 01:12:06,157
And now they have what they
need to take it further.

911
01:12:08,451 --> 01:12:11,787
We have to strike now, while
we still hold the upper hand.

912
01:12:14,624 --> 01:12:16,667
I've seen too many
friends die, Erik.

913
01:12:18,753 --> 01:12:21,063
I don't want a war.

914
01:12:21,088 --> 01:12:22,924
I only want the man
who murdered them.

915
01:12:23,090 --> 01:12:24,592
This is war.

916
01:12:26,427 --> 01:12:28,262
What happened to you?

917
01:12:29,096 --> 01:12:31,349
Did you lose your way
while I was gone?

918
01:12:33,351 --> 01:12:35,436
Are you still Charles' Raven?

919
01:12:37,772 --> 01:12:40,191
Or are you Mystique?

920
01:12:43,611 --> 01:12:45,154
Trask is the enemy.

921
01:12:47,323 --> 01:12:49,367
Killing one man isn't enough.

922
01:12:49,784 --> 01:12:51,118
It never was for you.

923
01:12:52,495 --> 01:12:53,704
Goodbye, Erik.

924
01:13:18,938 --> 01:13:20,164
What happened?

925
01:13:20,189 --> 01:13:21,816
Come on.
Can he walk?

926
01:13:21,983 --> 01:13:23,150
He needs his treatment.

927
01:13:23,651 --> 01:13:24,835
Hank, I can hear them.

928
01:13:24,860 --> 01:13:25,987
I know. It's okay.

929
01:13:26,153 --> 01:13:28,197
Can you make it stop?
I'll get them.

930
01:13:30,199 --> 01:13:31,325
Hey, hey.

931
01:13:31,450 --> 01:13:33,160
Pull yourself together.

932
01:13:33,327 --> 01:13:34,829
It's not over yet.

933
01:13:37,999 --> 01:13:39,375
You don't believe that.

934
01:13:41,294 --> 01:13:42,670
How do you know?

935
01:13:42,837 --> 01:13:44,505
As these go...

936
01:13:46,215 --> 01:13:49,510
this comes back.

937
01:13:50,177 --> 01:13:52,513
They all come back.

938
01:13:57,685 --> 01:13:59,103
Look.

939
01:13:59,854 --> 01:14:01,522
I'm still here...

940
01:14:02,565 --> 01:14:04,066
and she's still out there.

941
01:14:06,235 --> 01:14:08,362
We need your help, Charles.

942
01:14:08,946 --> 01:14:10,531
Not like this.
I need you.

943
01:14:10,990 --> 01:14:14,243
We can't find Raven.
Not without your powers.

944
01:14:17,872 --> 01:14:20,207
I added a little extra
because you missed a dose.

945
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:27,048
Charles.

946
01:14:58,412 --> 01:15:00,539
Hank, do me a favor.

947
01:15:01,248 --> 01:15:03,542
Would you help me
to my study, please?

948
01:15:08,547 --> 01:15:10,299
Come on, I got you.

949
01:15:20,434 --> 01:15:22,728
Are you sure about this?

950
01:15:24,105 --> 01:15:26,232
Absolutely not.

951
01:15:32,780 --> 01:15:34,949
This creature is extraordinary.

952
01:15:36,158 --> 01:15:37,843
Her genes could hold the key

953
01:15:37,868 --> 01:15:39,970
to mutation itself.

954
01:15:39,995 --> 01:15:41,138
I need more.

955
01:15:41,163 --> 01:15:43,999
That's all they were able to
scrape off the pavement in Paris.

956
01:15:44,166 --> 01:15:45,334
More than blood.

957
01:15:45,835 --> 01:15:47,628
I need brain tissue...

958
01:15:47,795 --> 01:15:50,423
spinal fluid, bone marrow.

959
01:15:51,549 --> 01:15:52,775
Imagine...

960
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:54,402
Sentinels that could transform,

961
01:15:54,427 --> 01:15:55,678
adapt to any target.

962
01:15:56,470 --> 01:15:58,597
If I could just get
my hands on her.

963
01:15:58,764 --> 01:16:00,658
This girl could leap

964
01:16:00,683 --> 01:16:02,435
the program forward years...

965
01:16:02,601 --> 01:16:04,478
decades into the future.

966
01:16:05,813 --> 01:16:07,106
How old is your son now, Major?

967
01:16:08,441 --> 01:16:09,525
Jason?

968
01:16:09,692 --> 01:16:11,752
He's coming up on ten now,
if you can believe it.

969
01:16:11,777 --> 01:16:13,279
Eight years from fighting age.

970
01:16:13,529 --> 01:16:15,423
And how many of
our sons and brothers

971
01:16:15,448 --> 01:16:17,199
did we just ship
home in body bags?

972
01:16:17,366 --> 01:16:19,326
Maybe fifty,
fifty-five thousand?

973
01:16:19,493 --> 01:16:20,953
And how many more
on the other side?

974
01:16:22,496 --> 01:16:24,331
Never before...

975
01:16:24,498 --> 01:16:27,501
in all of human history...

976
01:16:27,668 --> 01:16:32,339
has there been a cause which
could unite us as a species.

977
01:16:33,340 --> 01:16:35,676
Until now.

978
01:16:36,969 --> 01:16:38,971
You really hate,
mutants, don't you?

979
01:16:39,138 --> 01:16:42,475
On the contrary,
I rather admire them.

980
01:16:42,641 --> 01:16:43,726
The things they can do.

981
01:16:45,394 --> 01:16:48,355
I see mutants as our salvation.

982
01:16:48,522 --> 01:16:49,690
A common enemy.

983
01:16:50,524 --> 01:16:53,652
A common struggle
against the ultimate enemy.

984
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:56,197
Extinction.

985
01:16:56,655 --> 01:16:57,798
I believe our new friends...

986
01:16:57,823 --> 01:17:00,201
are going to help us
usher in a new era, Bill.

987
01:17:00,367 --> 01:17:02,703
A new era of genuine...

988
01:17:02,870 --> 01:17:05,623
and long-lasting peace.

989
01:17:19,595 --> 01:17:21,113
<i>Attention, attention.</i>

990
01:17:21,138 --> 01:17:23,015
<i>Transport departure
in two hours.</i>

991
01:17:23,182 --> 01:17:27,186
<i>Repeat. Transport
departure in two hours.</i>

992
01:17:33,359 --> 01:17:36,153
When was the last
time you were down here?

993
01:17:36,362 --> 01:17:37,738
The last time we went
looking for students.

994
01:17:38,030 --> 01:17:39,740
A lifetime ago.

995
01:17:45,621 --> 01:17:47,790
Welcome, Professor.

996
01:18:11,272 --> 01:18:13,482
Raven's wounded.
She won't be moving fast.

997
01:18:21,907 --> 01:18:24,243
These are muscles I haven't
stretched in a long time.

998
01:19:07,828 --> 01:19:08,829
Charles!

999
01:19:11,290 --> 01:19:12,374
Charles!

1000
01:19:20,299 --> 01:19:23,093
Charles? It's all right.

1001
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:27,473
I'll go check the generator.

1002
01:19:35,230 --> 01:19:36,815
It's not the machinery, is it?

1003
01:19:37,650 --> 01:19:39,068
I can't do this.
My mind...

1004
01:19:39,193 --> 01:19:40,402
Yes, you can.

1005
01:19:40,527 --> 01:19:42,379
It won't take it.
You're just a little rusty.

1006
01:19:42,404 --> 01:19:44,865
You don't understand. It's not
a question of being rusty.

1007
01:19:45,032 --> 01:19:46,842
I can flip the switches.
I can turn the knobs.

1008
01:19:46,867 --> 01:19:50,496
But my power comes from here.
It comes from...

1009
01:19:51,205 --> 01:19:52,873
And it's broken.

1010
01:19:53,999 --> 01:19:55,918
I feel like one of my students.

1011
01:19:56,210 --> 01:19:57,503
Helpless.

1012
01:19:58,879 --> 01:20:00,230
It was a mistake
coming down here.

1013
01:20:00,255 --> 01:20:01,857
It was a mistake freeing Erik.

1014
01:20:01,882 --> 01:20:04,318
This whole thing has
been one bloody mistake.

1015
01:20:04,343 --> 01:20:06,845
I'm sorry, Logan, but they
sent back the wrong man.

1016
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:09,098
You're right.

1017
01:20:10,432 --> 01:20:11,934
I am.

1018
01:20:12,851 --> 01:20:14,353
Actually, it was
supposed to be you.

1019
01:20:15,396 --> 01:20:18,941
But I was the only one who could
physically make the trip.

1020
01:20:19,608 --> 01:20:20,734
And, uh...

1021
01:20:21,068 --> 01:20:22,653
And I don't know
how long I've got here.

1022
01:20:23,112 --> 01:20:25,906
But I do know that
a long time ago...

1023
01:20:26,532 --> 01:20:28,909
actually, a long
time from now...

1024
01:20:29,243 --> 01:20:32,413
I was your most
helpless student.

1025
01:20:32,871 --> 01:20:35,249
And you unlocked my mind.

1026
01:20:35,416 --> 01:20:38,085
You showed me what I was.

1027
01:20:38,252 --> 01:20:40,087
You showed me what I could be.

1028
01:20:40,254 --> 01:20:42,256
I don't know how
to do that for you.

1029
01:20:42,423 --> 01:20:44,383
You're right.
I don't.

1030
01:20:46,260 --> 01:20:48,303
But I know someone who might.

1031
01:20:48,762 --> 01:20:50,406
Hmm.

1032
01:20:50,431 --> 01:20:53,392
Look into my mind.

1033
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:55,911
You saw what I did to Cerebro.

1034
01:20:55,936 --> 01:20:57,246
You don't want me
inside your head.

1035
01:20:57,271 --> 01:20:58,414
There's no damage you can do...

1036
01:20:58,439 --> 01:20:59,999
that hasn't already
been done. Trust me.

1037
01:21:00,107 --> 01:21:01,108
Come on.

1038
01:21:12,578 --> 01:21:13,620
Hey.

1039
01:21:15,539 --> 01:21:16,640
Hey, Logan.

1040
01:21:16,665 --> 01:21:17,666
Hi, Jean.

1041
01:21:18,125 --> 01:21:19,268
Kill me.

1042
01:21:19,293 --> 01:21:20,294
I love you.

1043
01:21:23,589 --> 01:21:28,110
You poor, poor man.

1044
01:21:28,135 --> 01:21:29,303
Look past me.

1045
01:21:29,470 --> 01:21:31,305
No, I don't want your suffering.

1046
01:21:31,472 --> 01:21:33,449
I don't want your future!

1047
01:21:33,474 --> 01:21:35,601
Look past my future.

1048
01:21:35,851 --> 01:21:37,978
Look for your future.

1049
01:21:41,482 --> 01:21:42,816
That's it.

1050
01:21:43,192 --> 01:21:44,443
That's it.

1051
01:21:46,153 --> 01:21:47,488
That's it.

1052
01:22:35,410 --> 01:22:37,371
Charles.

1053
01:22:39,206 --> 01:22:40,582
Charles.

1054
01:22:44,837 --> 01:22:47,214
So this is what becomes of us.

1055
01:22:48,507 --> 01:22:50,342
Erik was right.

1056
01:22:51,009 --> 01:22:53,220
Humanity does this to us.

1057
01:22:53,387 --> 01:22:56,014
Not if we show
them a better path.

1058
01:22:56,932 --> 01:22:58,600
You still believe?

1059
01:22:58,767 --> 01:23:01,228
Just because someone
stumbles, loses their way...

1060
01:23:01,395 --> 01:23:04,231
it doesn't mean
they're lost forever.

1061
01:23:04,857 --> 01:23:08,610
Sometimes we all need
a little help.

1062
01:23:09,570 --> 01:23:11,238
Oh, I'm not the man I was.

1063
01:23:13,407 --> 01:23:15,450
I open my mind...

1064
01:23:16,034 --> 01:23:18,245
and it almost overwhelms me.

1065
01:23:18,579 --> 01:23:22,082
You're afraid,
and Cerebro knows it.

1066
01:23:23,250 --> 01:23:25,794
All those voices...

1067
01:23:27,546 --> 01:23:32,217
so much pain.

1068
01:23:32,593 --> 01:23:35,929
It's not their pain
you're afraid of.

1069
01:23:36,096 --> 01:23:38,098
It's yours, Charles.

1070
01:23:39,391 --> 01:23:41,894
And as frightening
as it may be...

1071
01:23:42,060 --> 01:23:44,897
that pain will
make you stronger.

1072
01:23:45,230 --> 01:23:48,275
If you allow
yourself to feel it...

1073
01:23:48,442 --> 01:23:50,152
embrace it...

1074
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:53,255
it will make you more powerful

1075
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:55,490
than you ever imagined.

1076
01:23:55,657 --> 01:23:57,467
It's the greatest

1077
01:23:57,492 --> 01:23:58,994
gift we have...

1078
01:23:59,161 --> 01:24:01,054
to bear their pain

1079
01:24:01,079 --> 01:24:02,998
without breaking.

1080
01:24:03,165 --> 01:24:04,958
And it's born...

1081
01:24:05,125 --> 01:24:07,502
from the most human power.

1082
01:24:08,503 --> 01:24:10,088
Hope.

1083
01:24:19,181 --> 01:24:21,516
Please, Charles...

1084
01:24:21,683 --> 01:24:25,646
we need you to hope again.

1085
01:24:33,946 --> 01:24:36,406
Find what you were looking for?

1086
01:24:42,204 --> 01:24:43,497
The power's back on.

1087
01:24:43,664 --> 01:24:44,957
Yes.

1088
01:24:45,999 --> 01:24:47,709
Yes, it is.

1089
01:26:28,060 --> 01:26:29,478
She's lost too much blood.

1090
01:26:30,103 --> 01:26:31,438
She can't keep going like this.

1091
01:26:31,605 --> 01:26:33,774
We have no choice, Bobby.

1092
01:26:33,940 --> 01:26:35,275
We can wake him up.
No!

1093
01:26:36,902 --> 01:26:38,153
They need more time.

1094
01:26:38,737 --> 01:26:40,781
I had...

1095
01:26:41,323 --> 01:26:43,325
a glimpse into the past.

1096
01:26:43,492 --> 01:26:44,910
If we wake Logan now...

1097
01:26:45,077 --> 01:26:48,455
we may set our fate
on an even darker course.

1098
01:26:48,663 --> 01:26:50,457
They need more time.

1099
01:27:09,810 --> 01:27:11,436
Raven, stop.

1100
01:27:12,354 --> 01:27:13,980
Stop running.

1101
01:27:14,314 --> 01:27:15,482
Charles?

1102
01:27:17,526 --> 01:27:18,668
Where are you?

1103
01:27:18,693 --> 01:27:19,961
Back at the house...

1104
01:27:19,986 --> 01:27:21,780
where you should be.

1105
01:27:21,947 --> 01:27:24,116
I need you to come home.

1106
01:27:24,825 --> 01:27:26,660
I know what I need to do.

1107
01:27:30,330 --> 01:27:31,598
If you kill Trask...

1108
01:27:31,623 --> 01:27:33,792
you will be creating countless
more just like him.

1109
01:27:34,459 --> 01:27:35,544
Then I'll kill them, too.

1110
01:27:35,669 --> 01:27:38,171
Those are Erik's words,
not yours.

1111
01:27:39,214 --> 01:27:40,715
Oh!

1112
01:27:41,842 --> 01:27:44,344
The girl I grew up with
wasn't capable of killing.

1113
01:27:44,469 --> 01:27:45,470
She was good...

1114
01:27:45,595 --> 01:27:48,181
fair, full of compassion.

1115
01:27:49,516 --> 01:27:51,326
I have compassion.

1116
01:27:51,351 --> 01:27:52,853
Just not for Trask.

1117
01:27:52,978 --> 01:27:54,646
He's murdered too many of us.

1118
01:27:58,525 --> 01:28:00,402
Shut her down, Charles.
Get in her head.

1119
01:28:00,569 --> 01:28:02,028
She's not letting me in.

1120
01:28:02,195 --> 01:28:05,407
I'm barely holding on.
I'm not strong enough yet.

1121
01:28:13,540 --> 01:28:15,375
I know what Trask has done...

1122
01:28:15,750 --> 01:28:18,086
but killing him
will not bring them back.

1123
01:28:18,712 --> 01:28:19,855
It will set you on a path...

1124
01:28:19,880 --> 01:28:21,882
from which there is no return.

1125
01:28:22,591 --> 01:28:24,342
An endless cycle of killing.

1126
01:28:24,509 --> 01:28:28,221
Us and them, until
there is nothing left.

1127
01:28:29,097 --> 01:28:33,101
But we can stop it,
right now, you and I.

1128
01:28:34,019 --> 01:28:37,105
You just have to come home.

1129
01:28:38,398 --> 01:28:40,192
I have to?

1130
01:28:40,567 --> 01:28:42,027
You haven't changed
at all, Charles.

1131
01:28:43,361 --> 01:28:44,446
Like I said...

1132
01:28:44,571 --> 01:28:46,948
I know exactly
what I have to do.

1133
01:29:02,255 --> 01:29:03,256
Where is she?

1134
01:29:03,423 --> 01:29:05,425
She's in an
airport, boarding a plane.

1135
01:29:06,134 --> 01:29:07,594
A plane to where?

1136
01:29:10,555 --> 01:29:12,224
Washington, D.C.

1137
01:29:13,934 --> 01:29:17,521
Guys, there's something
I need to show you.

1138
01:29:19,940 --> 01:29:21,733
We're going backwards in time.

1139
01:29:21,900 --> 01:29:23,960
I set the system I designed...

1140
01:29:23,985 --> 01:29:26,363
to record any news about Paris
over all three networks...

1141
01:29:26,738 --> 01:29:27,822
and PBS.

1142
01:29:28,240 --> 01:29:29,783
All three? Wow.

1143
01:29:30,116 --> 01:29:31,785
Yeah, and PBS.

1144
01:29:32,786 --> 01:29:34,204
Look what I found.

1145
01:29:34,371 --> 01:29:35,851
Tomorrow, in front
of the White House,

1146
01:29:35,872 --> 01:29:37,472
the President will
make his announcement.

1147
01:29:37,791 --> 01:29:39,960
He will be joined by Secretary
of Defense Laird...

1148
01:29:40,126 --> 01:29:43,713
and has even sought the help of
renowned scientist Bolivar Trask...

1149
01:29:43,880 --> 01:29:47,384
his special advisor
to combat this mutant issue.

1150
01:29:47,551 --> 01:29:48,693
The White House has asked...

1151
01:29:48,718 --> 01:29:49,945
Raven doesn't realize...

1152
01:29:49,970 --> 01:29:51,905
that if she kills Trask
at an event like that...

1153
01:29:51,930 --> 01:29:54,307
with the whole world watching...

1154
01:29:55,100 --> 01:29:57,561
Then I came a long way
for nothing.

1155
01:29:58,103 --> 01:30:00,183
And there's more bad news.
I saw in a report...

1156
01:30:00,647 --> 01:30:02,207
they found traces
of her blood in Paris.

1157
01:30:02,482 --> 01:30:05,485
For all we know,
they already have her DNA...

1158
01:30:05,652 --> 01:30:06,836
which is all they'd need.

1159
01:30:06,861 --> 01:30:08,989
To create the Sentinels
of the future.

1160
01:30:12,576 --> 01:30:14,636
There's a theory
in quantum physics...

1161
01:30:14,661 --> 01:30:16,288
that time is immutable.

1162
01:30:16,496 --> 01:30:18,431
It's like a river. You can
throw a pebble into it...

1163
01:30:18,456 --> 01:30:21,751
and create a ripple, but the
current always corrects itself.

1164
01:30:22,669 --> 01:30:24,604
No matter what you do, the river

1165
01:30:24,629 --> 01:30:26,423
just keeps flowing
in the same direction.

1166
01:30:26,840 --> 01:30:28,133
What are you trying to say?

1167
01:30:28,300 --> 01:30:30,176
What I'm saying is...

1168
01:30:30,343 --> 01:30:31,987
what if the war is inevitable?

1169
01:30:32,012 --> 01:30:34,431
What if she's meant
to kill Trask?

1170
01:30:35,974 --> 01:30:38,518
What if this is just
simply who she is?

1171
01:30:40,520 --> 01:30:44,524
Just because someone
stumbles, loses their way...

1172
01:30:44,691 --> 01:30:46,693
doesn't mean
they're lost forever.

1173
01:30:51,531 --> 01:30:54,200
No, I don't believe
that theory, Hank.

1174
01:30:55,118 --> 01:30:58,121
And I cannot believe
that is who she is.

1175
01:30:59,372 --> 01:31:00,557
Ready the plane.

1176
01:31:00,582 --> 01:31:03,001
We're going to Washington.

1177
01:32:20,995 --> 01:32:22,497
You all right?

1178
01:32:22,622 --> 01:32:23,665
Getting there.

1179
01:32:28,586 --> 01:32:31,256
Whatever happens today, I need
you to promise me something.

1180
01:32:32,132 --> 01:32:35,260
You've looked into my mind
and seen a lot of bad...

1181
01:32:36,136 --> 01:32:37,804
but you've seen the good, too.

1182
01:32:38,847 --> 01:32:40,515
The X-Men.

1183
01:32:41,766 --> 01:32:43,351
Promise me you'll find us.

1184
01:32:45,145 --> 01:32:47,147
Use your power,
bring us together.

1185
01:32:47,772 --> 01:32:49,858
Guide us. Lead us.

1186
01:32:51,526 --> 01:32:54,320
Storm. Scott.

1187
01:32:56,489 --> 01:32:57,824
Jean.

1188
01:32:59,159 --> 01:33:01,327
Remember those names.

1189
01:33:02,328 --> 01:33:04,664
There are so many of us.

1190
01:33:05,331 --> 01:33:07,667
We will need you, Professor.

1191
01:33:10,628 --> 01:33:13,047
I'll do my best.

1192
01:33:13,214 --> 01:33:14,883
Your best is enough.

1193
01:33:16,801 --> 01:33:18,511
Trust me.

1194
01:33:42,494 --> 01:33:44,954
There's 12 carriers
inbound, 10 miles!

1195
01:33:45,872 --> 01:33:46,956
They've found us.

1196
01:34:04,015 --> 01:34:06,201
Thousands of people
will be gathered here today.

1197
01:34:06,226 --> 01:34:07,702
They've come from
all over the world...

1198
01:34:07,727 --> 01:34:10,563
to witness history,
along with news crews...

1199
01:34:10,730 --> 01:34:12,232
from at least 50
different countries.

1200
01:34:13,942 --> 01:34:15,276
Thank you.

1201
01:34:17,695 --> 01:34:19,055
Can I see your
invitations, please?

1202
01:34:19,864 --> 01:34:21,174
Yes, you may.

1203
01:34:21,199 --> 01:34:22,383
These two are with me.

1204
01:34:22,408 --> 01:34:23,510
Go ahead.

1205
01:34:23,535 --> 01:34:24,661
Thank you.

1206
01:34:31,417 --> 01:34:32,794
Logan!

1207
01:34:32,919 --> 01:34:34,519
Please, this way, sir.

1208
01:35:01,281 --> 01:35:03,161
I haven't found her yet.
But she has to be here.

1209
01:35:03,283 --> 01:35:05,083
<i>The President
of the United States.</i>

1210
01:35:27,807 --> 01:35:29,517
My fellow Americans...

1211
01:35:29,684 --> 01:35:34,355
today we face the gravest
threat in our history...

1212
01:35:34,480 --> 01:35:35,707
mutants.

1213
01:35:38,818 --> 01:35:41,237
We have prepared
for this threat.

1214
01:35:44,240 --> 01:35:47,827
In the immortal words
of Robert Oppenheimer...

1215
01:35:47,994 --> 01:35:49,120
"Behold."

1216
01:35:49,704 --> 01:35:52,498
"The world will never be
the same again."

1217
01:36:23,029 --> 01:36:24,030
Can I help you?

1218
01:36:27,408 --> 01:36:28,618
No, you can't.

1219
01:37:06,572 --> 01:37:07,824
Here they come.

1220
01:37:14,580 --> 01:37:16,340
<i>This is for you,
brothers and sisters.</i>

1221
01:37:18,835 --> 01:37:19,919
Raven?

1222
01:37:22,672 --> 01:37:23,756
I have her.

1223
01:37:24,424 --> 01:37:25,984
Let me go, Charles.

1224
01:37:27,802 --> 01:37:29,262
There. You see?

1225
01:37:29,429 --> 01:37:30,513
Secret Serviceman.

1226
01:37:30,680 --> 01:37:31,764
Left of the stage.

1227
01:37:31,889 --> 01:37:33,016
- Got him.
- Go.

1228
01:37:53,786 --> 01:37:55,138
What the hell are you doing?

1229
01:37:55,163 --> 01:37:56,639
I didn't tell you
to activate them.

1230
01:37:56,664 --> 01:37:57,832
I didn't.

1231
01:38:16,434 --> 01:38:18,311
<i>Raven, please, listen to me.</i>

1232
01:38:18,811 --> 01:38:22,940
<i>We've been given a second
chance to define who we are.</i>

1233
01:38:24,984 --> 01:38:26,360
<i>Don't do this.</i>

1234
01:38:29,781 --> 01:38:32,033
Gentlemen, you cannot
pass this point.

1235
01:38:39,874 --> 01:38:41,626
We can't stop that many.

1236
01:38:41,793 --> 01:38:44,670
No, but we can slow them down.

1237
01:39:22,542 --> 01:39:24,210
Erik!

1238
01:39:58,494 --> 01:39:59,495
Ah!

1239
01:40:09,046 --> 01:40:10,756
Storm!

1240
01:40:29,150 --> 01:40:30,626
Go, go, go!

1241
01:40:32,528 --> 01:40:33,613
Watch your head!

1242
01:40:46,584 --> 01:40:47,727
Go, go, go!

1243
01:40:47,752 --> 01:40:49,128
Take us to DEFCON 3.

1244
01:40:49,295 --> 01:40:50,563
Mr. President,
we are Code Red.

1245
01:40:50,588 --> 01:40:51,964
What's our air
defense readiness?

1246
01:40:52,131 --> 01:40:53,441
All our air
defenses are ready one.

1247
01:40:53,466 --> 01:40:54,942
What the hell
happened out there?

1248
01:40:54,967 --> 01:40:56,110
I will fix it.

1249
01:40:56,135 --> 01:40:57,178
You said that before.

1250
01:40:57,303 --> 01:40:58,512
I wanted to make a statement.

1251
01:40:58,638 --> 01:41:01,490
Now the whole goddamn world
knows we can't protect them.

1252
01:41:01,515 --> 01:41:02,658
I will fix it.

1253
01:41:02,683 --> 01:41:04,477
You damn well better.

1254
01:42:15,923 --> 01:42:16,924
Charles!

1255
01:42:18,050 --> 01:42:19,385
No, no, no...

1256
01:43:05,973 --> 01:43:07,725
Is everybody okay?

1257
01:43:41,592 --> 01:43:43,177
No!

1258
01:43:46,305 --> 01:43:47,348
Behind you.

1259
01:43:49,725 --> 01:43:51,602
Ah!

1260
01:44:32,017 --> 01:44:33,352
Now!

1261
01:44:56,709 --> 01:44:59,253
I'm probably not supposed
to ask this kind of thing...

1262
01:44:59,753 --> 01:45:02,381
but in the future, do I make it?

1263
01:45:02,840 --> 01:45:04,175
No.

1264
01:45:05,885 --> 01:45:07,361
But we can change that.

1265
01:45:07,386 --> 01:45:08,929
Right?

1266
01:45:19,565 --> 01:45:21,192
Do what you were made for.

1267
01:45:30,409 --> 01:45:31,911
Where are you?

1268
01:45:37,708 --> 01:45:38,709
Ah!

1269
01:45:49,261 --> 01:45:50,763
I got this! Go!

1270
01:46:33,472 --> 01:46:35,140
Oh, dear God, no.

1271
01:46:51,031 --> 01:46:53,284
So much for being a survivor.

1272
01:47:35,743 --> 01:47:37,036
One of them is in here.

1273
01:47:39,663 --> 01:47:41,415
No, no, no!
Don't kill it!

1274
01:47:42,082 --> 01:47:43,167
I need it alive.

1275
01:47:56,597 --> 01:47:58,223
What the hell has happened?

1276
01:49:05,999 --> 01:49:08,210
You built these
weapons to destroy us.

1277
01:49:09,169 --> 01:49:10,879
Why?

1278
01:49:14,466 --> 01:49:17,177
<i>Because you are
afraid of our gifts.</i>

1279
01:49:18,137 --> 01:49:20,639
<i>Because we are different.</i>

1280
01:49:21,807 --> 01:49:25,144
<i>Humanity has always feared
that which is different.</i>

1281
01:49:25,811 --> 01:49:27,187
<i>Well, I am here to tell you...</i>

1282
01:49:27,396 --> 01:49:28,814
to tell the world...

1283
01:49:29,815 --> 01:49:31,984
you are right to fear us.

1284
01:49:32,359 --> 01:49:34,069
<i>We are the future.</i>

1285
01:49:34,820 --> 01:49:37,489
<i>We are the ones
who will inherit this earth.</i>

1286
01:49:37,740 --> 01:49:40,325
And anyone who
stands in our way...

1287
01:49:40,492 --> 01:49:42,494
will suffer the same fate
as these men...

1288
01:49:42,661 --> 01:49:43,996
you see before you.

1289
01:49:51,211 --> 01:49:53,839
<i>Today was meant to be a
display of your power.</i>

1290
01:49:54,590 --> 01:49:56,675
Instead I give you a glimpse...

1291
01:49:56,842 --> 01:50:00,345
<i>of the devastation my race
can unleash upon yours.</i>

1292
01:50:09,563 --> 01:50:11,732
<i>Let this be a warning
to the world.</i>

1293
01:50:12,441 --> 01:50:15,235
<i>And to my mutant brothers
and sisters out there...</i>

1294
01:50:16,028 --> 01:50:17,446
<i>I say this.</i>

1295
01:50:18,197 --> 01:50:19,865
<i>No more hiding.</i>

1296
01:50:20,032 --> 01:50:21,867
<i>No more suffering.</i>

1297
01:50:22,701 --> 01:50:25,078
You have lived in the shadows...

1298
01:50:25,245 --> 01:50:28,081
<i>in shame and fear for too long.
Come out.</i>

1299
01:50:29,333 --> 01:50:30,726
<i>Join me.</i>

1300
01:50:30,751 --> 01:50:34,254
<i>Fight together in
a brotherhood of our kind.</i>

1301
01:50:34,880 --> 01:50:36,548
A new tomorrow...

1302
01:50:37,758 --> 01:50:39,551
that starts today.

1303
01:50:46,767 --> 01:50:48,602
<i>All those years wasted...</i>

1304
01:50:48,769 --> 01:50:50,771
fighting each other, Charles.

1305
01:50:54,316 --> 01:50:57,945
To have a precious
few of them back...

1306
01:51:36,692 --> 01:51:37,960
Mr. President, sir.
Stand down.

1307
01:51:37,985 --> 01:51:39,862
I said, stand down!

1308
01:51:41,697 --> 01:51:43,365
You want to make a statement?

1309
01:51:43,824 --> 01:51:45,617
Kill me. Fine.

1310
01:51:45,784 --> 01:51:47,703
But spare everyone else.

1311
01:52:00,340 --> 01:52:02,342
Very heroic,
Mr. President...

1312
01:52:02,843 --> 01:52:04,344
but you had no intention...

1313
01:52:04,469 --> 01:52:06,680
of sparing any of us.

1314
01:52:07,139 --> 01:52:10,534
The future of our
species begins now.

1315
01:52:46,011 --> 01:52:47,237
You used to be a better shot.

1316
01:52:47,262 --> 01:52:48,513
Trust me, I still am.

1317
01:53:02,361 --> 01:53:03,862
Get out of my head, Charles!

1318
01:53:04,029 --> 01:53:05,530
Raven.

1319
01:53:05,697 --> 01:53:07,574
Please, do not make us
the enemy today.

1320
01:53:07,783 --> 01:53:09,618
Look around you.
We already are.

1321
01:53:10,118 --> 01:53:11,870
Not all of us.

1322
01:53:12,079 --> 01:53:14,331
All you've done so far...

1323
01:53:14,665 --> 01:53:16,667
is save the lives of these men.

1324
01:53:17,709 --> 01:53:20,253
You can show them a better path.

1325
01:53:23,924 --> 01:53:25,384
Shut her down, Charles.

1326
01:53:27,594 --> 01:53:31,223
I've been trying to control you
ever since the day we met...

1327
01:53:31,598 --> 01:53:33,600
and look where that's got us.

1328
01:53:35,727 --> 01:53:38,563
Everything that happens now...

1329
01:53:39,231 --> 01:53:41,400
is in your hands.

1330
01:53:45,445 --> 01:53:48,240
I have faith in you, Raven.

1331
01:55:26,922 --> 01:55:29,049
He's all yours, Charles.

1332
01:55:56,618 --> 01:55:59,246
If you let them have me,
I'm as good as dead.

1333
01:55:59,412 --> 01:56:00,789
You know that.

1334
01:56:01,456 --> 01:56:03,041
I know.

1335
01:56:05,043 --> 01:56:06,711
Goodbye, old friend.

1336
01:56:09,381 --> 01:56:11,216
Goodbye, Erik.

1337
01:56:44,624 --> 01:56:46,626
Are you sure you
should let them go?

1338
01:56:47,586 --> 01:56:48,962
Yes.

1339
01:56:49,588 --> 01:56:51,298
I have hope for them.

1340
01:56:52,465 --> 01:56:56,469
There's going to be a time,
Hank, when we are all together.

1341
01:57:00,348 --> 01:57:02,309
What about Logan?

1342
01:57:34,132 --> 01:57:36,801
<i>The first time</i>

1343
01:57:39,804 --> 01:57:45,060
<i>Ever I saw your face</i>

1344
01:57:50,023 --> 01:57:53,418
<i>I thought the sun...</i>

1345
01:58:17,926 --> 01:58:21,238
Buckminster Fuller is a
great example of an architect...

1346
01:58:21,263 --> 01:58:25,517
whose ideas were very similar
to those of a utopian future.

1347
01:58:31,856 --> 01:58:34,526
Good morning, Logan.
Late start.

1348
01:58:44,619 --> 01:58:45,954
Have a good lunch.

1349
01:58:46,121 --> 01:58:47,372
- Good job.
- Thank you.

1350
01:58:47,706 --> 01:58:49,040
Very good job.

1351
01:58:49,916 --> 01:58:51,501
Storm.

1352
01:59:22,574 --> 01:59:23,658
Jean.

1353
01:59:25,076 --> 01:59:26,411
Hey, Logan.

1354
01:59:26,953 --> 01:59:28,079
Jean.

1355
01:59:28,788 --> 01:59:30,498
Are you okay?

1356
01:59:32,250 --> 01:59:33,668
You're here.

1357
01:59:34,294 --> 01:59:36,338
Where else would I be?

1358
01:59:38,631 --> 01:59:39,632
Whoa.

1359
01:59:40,467 --> 01:59:42,427
Easy, pal.

1360
01:59:43,970 --> 01:59:46,514
Well, some things never change.

1361
01:59:47,932 --> 01:59:49,517
It's good to see you, Scott.

1362
01:59:51,311 --> 01:59:52,620
Uh-huh.

1363
01:59:52,645 --> 01:59:53,813
See you later, Jean.

1364
01:59:57,942 --> 01:59:59,486
Professor.

1365
01:59:59,944 --> 02:00:02,739
Logan, is everything all right?

1366
02:00:06,117 --> 02:00:07,577
Yeah.

1367
02:00:08,620 --> 02:00:10,455
Yeah, I think it is.

1368
02:00:27,013 --> 02:00:28,281
You did it.

1369
02:00:28,306 --> 02:00:29,616
Did what?

1370
02:00:29,641 --> 02:00:31,643
Logan, don't you have
a class to teach?

1371
02:00:32,310 --> 02:00:33,978
A class to teach?

1372
02:00:35,021 --> 02:00:36,106
History.

1373
02:00:36,815 --> 02:00:38,316
History?

1374
02:00:39,150 --> 02:00:40,819
Actually, I could use
some help with that.

1375
02:00:41,319 --> 02:00:42,821
Help with what?

1376
02:00:42,987 --> 02:00:46,491
Pretty much
everything after 1973.

1377
02:00:51,037 --> 02:00:54,082
I think the history I know
is a little different.

1378
02:00:55,708 --> 02:00:57,419
Welcome back.

1379
02:01:00,171 --> 02:01:01,840
It's good to see you, Charles.

1380
02:01:03,216 --> 02:01:05,051
It's good to see everyone.

1381
02:01:05,218 --> 02:01:06,719
Well...

1382
02:01:07,345 --> 02:01:09,514
I had a promise to keep.

1383
02:01:10,682 --> 02:01:13,935
You and I have a lot of
catching up to do.

1384
02:01:14,853 --> 02:01:16,354
Yeah.

1385
02:01:19,899 --> 02:01:22,026
What's the last thing
you remember?

1386
02:01:27,115 --> 02:01:28,867
Drowning.

1387
02:01:37,125 --> 02:01:38,376
<i>The past.</i>

1388
02:01:39,878 --> 02:01:41,187
<i>A new...</i>

1389
02:01:41,212 --> 02:01:42,964
<i>and uncertain world.</i>

1390
02:01:54,392 --> 02:01:56,686
<i>A world of
endless possibilities.</i>

1391
02:01:59,439 --> 02:02:01,566
<i>And infinite outcomes.</i>

1392
02:02:03,234 --> 02:02:04,360
You kidding me?

1393
02:02:04,486 --> 02:02:05,945
Oh, he's alive!

1394
02:02:10,325 --> 02:02:13,077
<i>Countless
choices define our fate.</i>

1395
02:02:13,995 --> 02:02:16,456
<i>Each choice, each moment...</i>

1396
02:02:16,623 --> 02:02:19,250
<i>a ripple in the river of time.</i>

1397
02:02:19,417 --> 02:02:21,753
What do you want us to do
with him, Major Stryker?

1398
02:02:21,920 --> 02:02:23,671
<i>Enough ripples...</i>

1399
02:02:23,838 --> 02:02:26,424
<i>and you change the tide.</i>

1400
02:02:26,591 --> 02:02:27,675
I'll take him from here.

1401
02:02:27,842 --> 02:02:31,763
<i>For the future
is never truly set.</i>

1402
