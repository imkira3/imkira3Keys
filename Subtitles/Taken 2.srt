2
00:03:26,082 --> 00:03:27,333
He slaughtered our men...

3
00:03:29,377 --> 00:03:30,545
our brothers...

4
00:03:32,797 --> 00:03:33,923
our sons.

5
00:03:36,467 --> 00:03:39,888
The dead cry out
to us for justice.

6
00:03:40,763 --> 00:03:44,225
On their souls, I swear to you.

7
00:03:44,976 --> 00:03:48,313
The man who took
our loved ones from us...

8
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:52,525
the man who has brought us
such pain and sorrow.

9
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:55,820
We Will find him.

10
00:03:56,738 --> 00:03:58,698
We will bring him here.

11
00:04:00,617 --> 00:04:06,372
We will not rest until his blood
flows into this very ground.

12
00:04:08,374 --> 00:04:10,877
We will have our revenge.

13
00:04:32,649 --> 00:04:34,108
Sir? Excuse me.

14
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:35,485
Yeah.

15
00:04:36,027 --> 00:04:38,404
The finish is included
in the cost of the wash.

16
00:04:38,571 --> 00:04:40,782
That's okay,
I'd rather do it myself.

17
00:04:40,865 --> 00:04:43,576
I'm a little
obsessive that way.

18
00:05:25,034 --> 00:05:26,786
Lenore.
Bryan.

19
00:05:26,953 --> 00:05:27,996
Hi. How are you?

20
00:05:28,162 --> 00:05:29,330
Fine. You?

21
00:05:29,414 --> 00:05:31,082
Mmm, good, good.

22
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:32,250
Is something up?

23
00:05:32,417 --> 00:05:35,003
No. It's Saturday, two o'clock.

24
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:37,046
Kim's driving lesson?

25
00:05:37,213 --> 00:05:38,881
Uh... Music lesson
got switched.

26
00:05:39,048 --> 00:05:41,259
The Tuesday one
or the Friday one?

27
00:05:41,426 --> 00:05:43,344
I have no idea.

28
00:05:44,804 --> 00:05:46,264
You know how kids are.
Mmm-hmm.

29
00:05:46,431 --> 00:05:48,016
Especially the ones
who are desperate

30
00:05:48,099 --> 00:05:49,819
to pass their driving
test at the third try.

31
00:05:49,934 --> 00:05:50,935
She's not desperate.

32
00:05:51,102 --> 00:05:54,897
But she failed the test twice, Lennie.
It's important.

33
00:05:55,064 --> 00:05:58,192
So, where is she, really?

34
00:05:59,694 --> 00:06:01,404
I've never been
a good liar, have I?

35
00:06:01,571 --> 00:06:03,531
No, it's not your forte.

36
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:07,785
She's at her boyfriend.

37
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:13,291
She has a boyfriend?

38
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:15,334
Do you want to
come in for a drink?

39
00:06:16,044 --> 00:06:17,462
Yeah.
I think you should.

40
00:06:21,257 --> 00:06:23,458
Why didn't she tell me, for God's sake?

41
00:06:23,468 --> 00:06:25,868
She probably didn't want you
running a full security check...

42
00:06:25,928 --> 00:06:28,765
of everything he's done
since kindergarten.

43
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:34,228
But she's okay, right?

44
00:06:34,395 --> 00:06:35,354
Yeah, she's okay.

45
00:06:40,568 --> 00:06:44,405
Lennie, tell me
it's none of my business...

46
00:06:44,572 --> 00:06:46,365
but are you okay?

47
00:06:48,701 --> 00:06:49,702
No.

48
00:06:50,828 --> 00:06:52,497
Not really.

49
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:54,832
We've separated.

50
00:06:56,918 --> 00:06:59,796
Lennie, if there's
anything I can do...

51
00:07:01,089 --> 00:07:02,673
Well, I better...

52
00:07:02,965 --> 00:07:04,550
Thanks for the wine.

53
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,260
Bryan.

54
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:07,929
Don't.

55
00:07:08,304 --> 00:07:09,514
I don't even know
where the kid lives.

56
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,060
You found her in a city of 12
million people within 72 hours.

57
00:07:14,227 --> 00:07:15,103
Promise me.

58
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:16,979
I just told you...
Promise.

59
00:07:17,772 --> 00:07:19,941
I'm going to
give her her space.

60
00:07:25,363 --> 00:07:28,366
<i>Let me show you what I know</i>

61
00:07:29,742 --> 00:07:33,120
<i>Let me take you where I'll go</i>

62
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:37,667
<i>I want to, yeah, share with you</i>

63
00:07:38,793 --> 00:07:41,045
<i>Why won't you let me...</i>

64
00:07:41,212 --> 00:07:43,256
Um... Just wait a sec.

65
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:44,465
What?

66
00:07:49,053 --> 00:07:50,555
I really like you.

67
00:07:52,056 --> 00:07:53,057
What is it?

68
00:07:54,392 --> 00:07:57,562
Um...
It's okay. It's okay.

69
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:00,189
Take all the time you need.

70
00:08:23,087 --> 00:08:24,213
Hi.

71
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,174
May I help you?

72
00:08:29,594 --> 00:08:31,429
Is Kim here?
Yeah, and you are...?

73
00:08:31,596 --> 00:08:32,680
Her father.

74
00:08:33,264 --> 00:08:36,100
Mr. Mills, what a pleasure.
I'm Jamie.

75
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,061
Come in.

76
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:43,065
Can I get you anything?
A drink?

77
00:08:43,232 --> 00:08:44,901
Just my daughter will be fine.

78
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:46,944
Dad?

79
00:08:47,111 --> 00:08:48,112
Hi.

80
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:49,447
What are you doing here?

81
00:08:49,614 --> 00:08:51,866
I know how important it is
for you to pass your test.

82
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:53,951
Wait. Kim, you don't
have a license?

83
00:08:54,118 --> 00:08:55,745
Have you ever tried to
parallel park an Escalade?

84
00:08:55,912 --> 00:08:58,289
I told you to take
the test with my car.

85
00:08:58,456 --> 00:08:59,624
God. Dad.

86
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:04,754
Thank you.

87
00:09:06,255 --> 00:09:08,132
A pleasure to
meet you, Mr. Mills.

88
00:09:16,057 --> 00:09:18,809
<i>Could we slow down
a little bit, please?</i>

89
00:09:19,143 --> 00:09:21,228
I can't believe you just did that.

90
00:09:21,646 --> 00:09:23,314
You're leaving on
fall break next week.

91
00:09:23,481 --> 00:09:26,442
This is the only time I can get to
do this before I go to Istanbul.

92
00:09:26,609 --> 00:09:28,653
<i>We planned this. When you
make plans, you keep them.</i>

93
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:30,237
No, Dad, you planned this.

94
00:09:31,447 --> 00:09:32,657
How did you even find me?

95
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:33,944
Your mom and I were talking.

96
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,284
Why didn't you tell me
you have a boyfriend?

97
00:09:35,451 --> 00:09:36,744
Because I knew
you'd overreact...

98
00:09:36,911 --> 00:09:39,956
and I just want to feel normal
even if I'm just pretending.

99
00:09:40,623 --> 00:09:42,249
Remember to brake
before the stop...

100
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:43,000
Dad.

101
00:09:47,838 --> 00:09:50,257
Mom doesn't know
where Jamie lives.

102
00:09:53,803 --> 00:09:55,137
GPS?

103
00:09:55,304 --> 00:09:58,516
I had it installed in your phone.
I'm sorry.

104
00:09:58,683 --> 00:10:01,852
You hear so many scary stories of
goings-on with people your age...

105
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:04,339
Dad, I don't even know how to
start feeling normal again...

106
00:10:04,355 --> 00:10:05,690
but this definitely isn't it.

107
00:10:07,984 --> 00:10:09,610
Kim, you can move.

108
00:10:22,665 --> 00:10:24,625
Use your side mirror.

109
00:10:37,221 --> 00:10:40,558
Perfect. Why couldn't you
do that in the test?

110
00:10:41,225 --> 00:10:42,393
I don't know.

111
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,062
Maybe I didn't really
want a license.

112
00:10:45,229 --> 00:10:46,230
Listen...

113
00:10:46,397 --> 00:10:49,025
of course I know
where you're coming from.

114
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:51,736
But you have to trust me
to figure this out.

115
00:10:52,695 --> 00:10:55,072
Don't do this again, please?

116
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:56,490
I won't.

117
00:10:57,074 --> 00:11:00,161
And don't go running a background
check on him with your friends.

118
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:01,662
I won't.

119
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:04,331
Okay.

120
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:06,333
See you Wednesday.

121
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,877
Two o'clock.

122
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:09,712
Love you.

123
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:12,089
Hey, I love you.

124
00:11:39,283 --> 00:11:40,284
Yeah.

125
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:41,911
Sam. Hi. It's me.

126
00:11:42,745 --> 00:11:46,457
Listen. I want you to run a
check on someone. Jamie Conrad.

127
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,167
The usual.
Not too deep.

128
00:11:48,334 --> 00:11:49,335
You got it.

129
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:50,544
<i>Okay. Thanks.</i>

130
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:06,644
Sir.

131
00:12:06,936 --> 00:12:07,937
Thank you.

132
00:12:14,026 --> 00:12:15,319
Mr. Pitrel?

133
00:12:15,861 --> 00:12:17,863
I have a registered letter for you.

134
00:12:18,155 --> 00:12:20,658
- Can you take that up, Sébastien?
- Yes, sir.

135
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:24,829
Here.

136
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:30,000
Sébastien?

137
00:12:54,567 --> 00:12:55,568
Where is he?

138
00:12:56,026 --> 00:12:57,027
I told you.

139
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:00,698
I don't know.

140
00:13:15,004 --> 00:13:16,088
Where is he?

141
00:13:19,592 --> 00:13:20,759
Where is he?

142
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:26,640
Okay.

143
00:13:31,562 --> 00:13:32,771
You want to play with me.

144
00:13:33,397 --> 00:13:34,440
No, no!

145
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,615
But I'm a good player, too.

146
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:51,582
Shh!

147
00:13:56,128 --> 00:13:57,004
Look.

148
00:13:57,296 --> 00:13:58,589
No, no!

149
00:14:00,257 --> 00:14:03,761
I guess the rules are changing.

150
00:14:06,764 --> 00:14:08,557
This man came to Paris.

151
00:14:09,475 --> 00:14:13,312
He used a card
to come into our house

152
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:15,522
and kill my friends..

153
00:14:16,357 --> 00:14:17,358
And my brother.

154
00:14:23,447 --> 00:14:24,907
This is your card.

155
00:14:32,957 --> 00:14:34,124
Where is he?

156
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:37,127
Where is he?

157
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:45,219
Stu, where are you going?
Come back!

158
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:23,090
What's happened?
Are you okay?

159
00:15:23,257 --> 00:15:25,009
Yeah, I'm great.

160
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:26,593
Come in. I'll get Kim.

161
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,928
Hey, hey, hey.

162
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:30,514
Lennie, talk to me.

163
00:15:32,141 --> 00:15:36,020
We had this trip planned to
China for Kim's spring break...

164
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:39,189
as a family, to try
and work things out.

165
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:40,858
And when Stu and I...

166
00:15:41,025 --> 00:15:43,235
I just thought it would
be nice for Kim and I

167
00:15:43,319 --> 00:15:45,112
to be away together...

168
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,864
away from all the tension.

169
00:15:47,323 --> 00:15:48,699
He canceled everything.

170
00:15:49,033 --> 00:15:50,617
All the reservations.

171
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:53,203
I just can't believe
he did this to us.

172
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:58,876
I'm just so tired.

173
00:15:59,043 --> 00:16:01,045
Just the fighting, the lawyers.

174
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:02,963
He's turned into
such a bastard.

175
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,673
I'm sorry, Lennie.

176
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,216
I'm sorry.

177
00:16:07,718 --> 00:16:10,387
I'm sorry. This is
really not your problem.

178
00:16:10,554 --> 00:16:12,848
It's my turn to have...

179
00:16:14,058 --> 00:16:15,351
I'll figure it out.

180
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:16,977
Look...

181
00:16:17,144 --> 00:16:19,229
Why don't you and
Kim come with me?

182
00:16:19,897 --> 00:16:22,733
But we can't impose on you.
You're working.

183
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,068
You're not imposing.

184
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:25,736
I'm working for three days.

185
00:16:25,903 --> 00:16:28,155
Then you can come over.

186
00:16:28,322 --> 00:16:29,406
It could be fun.

187
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,075
That's so sweet.

188
00:16:31,909 --> 00:16:33,994
I don't know.
I can't think right now.

189
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:36,705
Sure, I understand.
No pressure.

190
00:16:36,872 --> 00:16:39,917
I leave in the morning.
I work three days. Call me.

191
00:16:40,084 --> 00:16:42,419
If you're coming, I'll hang around.
If not, I'll come back.

192
00:16:42,586 --> 00:16:43,587
That's it.

193
00:16:43,754 --> 00:16:45,214
I'll go get Kim.

194
00:16:45,381 --> 00:16:46,173
Okay.

195
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:47,674
Thank you, Bryan.

196
00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:00,187
<i>She is definitely coming.</i>

197
00:17:00,354 --> 00:17:02,523
I don't know. Sam, I don't know.
Oh, come on.

198
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:04,233
You should have insisted.
Mmm-hmm.

199
00:17:04,942 --> 00:17:06,443
Come on, guys.
Cut me some slack.

200
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:07,861
She's going
through a hard time.

201
00:17:07,945 --> 00:17:09,238
I didn't want to
make it harder on her.

202
00:17:09,405 --> 00:17:11,031
She was confiding in me.

203
00:17:11,115 --> 00:17:13,784
Oh! I didn't know you guys
were still so cozy...

204
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:16,078
that she shares her
marriage issues with you.

205
00:17:16,245 --> 00:17:17,454
Wait a minute.

206
00:17:17,621 --> 00:17:21,041
I know you guys were close,
obviously, but are you close again?

207
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:22,459
Close like...

208
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:24,128
I'll lay money she's still
got something for him.

209
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:25,796
Don't go there, friend.

210
00:17:25,963 --> 00:17:28,549
Maybe he still
has something for her!

211
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:31,301
Can we talk about basketball?
For God's sake, come on!

212
00:17:48,318 --> 00:17:50,070
Istanbul.

213
00:17:59,413 --> 00:18:00,831
Thank you, Mr. Mills.

214
00:18:00,998 --> 00:18:03,667
You made my stay
feel very secure.

215
00:18:07,296 --> 00:18:09,590
Thank you.
Have a safe trip home.

216
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:10,799
You also.

217
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:29,443
<i>You've reached Lenore. Leave
a message after the beep.</i>

218
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:31,320
Hey, it's me.

219
00:18:31,487 --> 00:18:32,863
No message from you...

220
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:35,532
so I guess you probably
found some place to go.

221
00:18:35,699 --> 00:18:37,868
I hope things are
a little easier.

222
00:18:38,035 --> 00:18:41,163
If you ever need to talk
or anything, I'm here.

223
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:42,789
I mean, I'll be there.

224
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:45,792
I'll probably
ship out tomorrow.

225
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:48,045
No news from Kim.

226
00:18:48,212 --> 00:18:50,297
I guess she's busy with
the boyfriend and all.

227
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:51,548
Dad.

228
00:18:53,675 --> 00:18:54,760
Surprise!

229
00:18:54,843 --> 00:18:56,845
Oh, my God. Kim, baby.

230
00:18:57,888 --> 00:18:59,890
Hey, Lennie.
Hello, Bryan.

231
00:19:00,057 --> 00:19:02,726
I was just leaving you a message.
When I didn't hear, it was...

232
00:19:02,893 --> 00:19:04,061
We wanted to surprise you.

233
00:19:04,228 --> 00:19:05,812
Well, you succeeded.

234
00:19:07,064 --> 00:19:08,425
You guys could have
been surprised.

235
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:09,816
I could have been out
of here and headed home.

236
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:11,401
Mom's been calling Sam.

237
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:13,070
Oh, yeah?
Uh-huh. Yes.

238
00:19:13,237 --> 00:19:14,530
We've been tracking you.

239
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:16,740
Exactly. You're not the
only one who's got moves.

240
00:19:16,907 --> 00:19:18,033
Apparently not.

241
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:20,661
Welcome to Istanbul.

242
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:29,253
Not too shabby, huh?

243
00:19:29,628 --> 00:19:30,462
Wow.

244
00:19:31,088 --> 00:19:33,423
Oh, my God.

245
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,801
Mom, look at this.

246
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:37,636
Oh, my God!

247
00:19:37,803 --> 00:19:38,804
It's crazy, right?

248
00:19:38,971 --> 00:19:40,138
It's beautiful!

249
00:19:40,305 --> 00:19:42,266
Thank you so much.
My pleasure.

250
00:19:42,432 --> 00:19:43,793
Listen, I'll let you
get settled...

251
00:19:43,934 --> 00:19:46,144
and I'll come and collect
you in half an hour?

252
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:47,604
Okay.

253
00:19:49,147 --> 00:19:50,941
Later.

254
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:10,544
Good morning.

255
00:20:16,466 --> 00:20:17,217
Good.

256
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:18,635
Go.

257
00:20:18,802 --> 00:20:19,469
Fast.

258
00:20:19,803 --> 00:20:20,554
Let's go.

259
00:21:09,227 --> 00:21:10,270
Hey.
Hey.

260
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:11,855
You look great.

261
00:21:12,022 --> 00:21:12,898
You, too.

262
00:21:13,732 --> 00:21:16,026
So, where are we heading?

263
00:21:16,193 --> 00:21:19,863
Well, I am going nowhere.
I'm beat.

264
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:23,408
I'm just going to take a nice
long bath and get into bed.

265
00:21:23,575 --> 00:21:24,618
Lennie. Are you sure?

266
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:25,702
Yeah.

267
00:21:27,245 --> 00:21:28,955
I guess it's just
you and me, kiddo.

268
00:21:29,206 --> 00:21:30,874
Anything special
you'd like to do?

269
00:21:32,876 --> 00:21:33,877
Kind of. Maybe.

270
00:22:01,655 --> 00:22:03,198
Hey.
Hey.

271
00:22:04,074 --> 00:22:05,155
You ready to take off, too?

272
00:22:05,158 --> 00:22:06,993
No, I thought I'd stick around
for a couple of more hours.

273
00:22:07,202 --> 00:22:08,203
Really?
Yeah.

274
00:22:08,537 --> 00:22:10,580
Cool.
No. Just kidding.

275
00:22:10,747 --> 00:22:13,750
Come on. Let's go. All right.
It's so crazy here.

276
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:21,925
On this side is Europe,
and the other side is Asia.

277
00:22:22,926 --> 00:22:26,513
And every conquest since,
for the last 2,500 years...

278
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,933
whether it was the West going
East or the East going West...

279
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,519
they all used this
very same waterway.

280
00:22:33,937 --> 00:22:35,814
You want some tea, baby?
Yeah.

281
00:22:35,981 --> 00:22:37,441
Just one, please.

282
00:22:37,607 --> 00:22:39,609
How do you know all this stuff?

283
00:22:39,985 --> 00:22:41,278
How do I know it?

284
00:22:41,611 --> 00:22:45,782
I read it in a book
on the flight over.

285
00:22:45,949 --> 00:22:48,285
And you can borrow
it if you wish.

286
00:22:48,452 --> 00:22:49,327
Yeah, I would.

287
00:22:50,787 --> 00:22:54,124
So, this Jamie...

288
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:57,169
Is it... serious?

289
00:22:57,335 --> 00:22:58,795
That was a really
smooth transition.

290
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:03,300
I don't know.

291
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:05,135
It's only been a few months.

292
00:23:05,302 --> 00:23:07,137
Are you in love with him?

293
00:23:09,014 --> 00:23:10,807
I guess I'm not sure yet.

294
00:23:10,974 --> 00:23:13,351
Have you ever
been in love before?

295
00:23:17,022 --> 00:23:19,858
Not the way that
Mom talks about it.

296
00:23:20,025 --> 00:23:21,818
How does she describe it?

297
00:23:22,194 --> 00:23:24,821
She said when you guys met...

298
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:29,242
that it was super special.

299
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:31,203
Super special?
She said that?

300
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:34,664
I think the exact
word she used was...

301
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,000
"magical."

302
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:41,171
Magical, huh?

303
00:24:27,884 --> 00:24:29,761
It's good to see
you again, my friend.

304
00:24:32,931 --> 00:24:34,266
Is everything prepared?

305
00:24:35,016 --> 00:24:36,393
As you requested.

306
00:24:37,352 --> 00:24:38,728
Ah! Perfect.

307
00:25:23,565 --> 00:25:25,275
Yeah?
He's in the lobby.

308
00:25:25,442 --> 00:25:26,985
Wait until he's outside.

309
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:29,112
And remember, alive.

310
00:25:31,364 --> 00:25:33,783
He's on to me.
I'm leaving.

311
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,760
- Hey.
- Hi.

312
00:25:51,926 --> 00:25:53,762
I thought we were
having lunch in the bazaar.

313
00:25:53,887 --> 00:25:54,971
Um...

314
00:25:55,055 --> 00:25:56,306
Jet lag just hit me...

315
00:25:56,473 --> 00:25:59,559
so I figured I'd veg out by
the pool and let you guys go.

316
00:25:59,726 --> 00:26:00,977
Meet up with you later?

317
00:26:01,645 --> 00:26:02,896
I guess. Okay with you?

318
00:26:03,063 --> 00:26:04,147
Of course. It's fine.

319
00:26:04,314 --> 00:26:06,107
Oh, okay. Bye.
Hey, Kim.

320
00:26:06,274 --> 00:26:08,394
That book I was telling you about?
It's on my dresser.

321
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:10,070
Definitely.

322
00:26:10,236 --> 00:26:12,072
No adventuring.
I'll go call the car.

323
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:13,323
Have fun.

324
00:26:14,074 --> 00:26:15,659
Hey, Kim.

325
00:26:15,825 --> 00:26:17,160
I know what you're doing.

326
00:26:17,327 --> 00:26:18,787
What?

327
00:26:25,627 --> 00:26:27,003
Yeah?

328
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:29,506
The daughter is staying here.
What can we do?

329
00:26:29,964 --> 00:26:32,801
I want all three of them.

330
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:35,011
Yes?

331
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:40,350
She thinks we just
fell off the turnip truck.

332
00:26:40,517 --> 00:26:41,559
What do you mean?

333
00:26:41,643 --> 00:26:43,269
She's trying to play cupid.

334
00:26:43,436 --> 00:26:44,437
Oh, I see.

335
00:26:45,021 --> 00:26:46,356
When you first came back...

336
00:26:46,523 --> 00:26:48,191
and said you wanted to
make up for all that time

337
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:50,110
that you lost with Kim?
Uh-huh?

338
00:26:50,193 --> 00:26:52,821
I thought, "Right.
Three weeks, he's gone."

339
00:26:52,987 --> 00:26:55,532
That was usually about the
limit you stuck around.

340
00:26:55,699 --> 00:26:57,117
Give or take a week.

341
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:01,287
Not too close.

342
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:04,390
You really proved me wrong.
I thought you'd never change.

343
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:06,042
Why not?

344
00:27:06,209 --> 00:27:08,503
I don't know.
Your personality.

345
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:11,464
When you commit to something...

346
00:27:11,631 --> 00:27:13,049
you focus all
your energy there.

347
00:27:13,216 --> 00:27:14,551
Like a dog with a bone.

348
00:27:14,718 --> 00:27:16,386
Nice analogy.

349
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,513
You know what I mean.

350
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:22,350
When you give, it's 100
percent of 100 percent.

351
00:27:22,517 --> 00:27:25,395
If I was on to something,
it was just that thing.

352
00:27:25,562 --> 00:27:28,231
Even though I tell myself
I should change...

353
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:30,734
I could never give it up.

354
00:27:31,818 --> 00:27:33,361
You gave us up.
Mmm-mmm.

355
00:27:33,903 --> 00:27:35,864
No, never.

356
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:37,907
Not in here.

357
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:57,427
Driver, turn left.

358
00:28:00,889 --> 00:28:02,599
Lennie, don't.

359
00:28:04,392 --> 00:28:05,268
What?

360
00:28:09,647 --> 00:28:10,927
Will you tell me
what's going on?

361
00:28:11,024 --> 00:28:12,025
It's okay.

362
00:28:18,823 --> 00:28:19,824
Where is he?

363
00:28:24,788 --> 00:28:26,989
You see the gallery entrance
in the middle of the block?

364
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,000
Will you tell me what's going on?
Do you see it?

365
00:28:29,501 --> 00:28:30,502
Yeah, I see it.

366
00:28:30,668 --> 00:28:32,337
When we stop,
I want you to get out

367
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,047
of the car like
you're a shopper.

368
00:28:34,214 --> 00:28:35,465
I want you to go inside.

369
00:28:35,632 --> 00:28:36,912
Will you tell me
what's going on?

370
00:28:36,925 --> 00:28:37,967
Listen to me.

371
00:28:38,134 --> 00:28:39,427
Lennie, there's
no time for this.

372
00:28:39,594 --> 00:28:41,221
Just talk to me!
Listen.

373
00:28:41,387 --> 00:28:44,140
When you exit the back of the
fabric store, turn right.

374
00:28:44,307 --> 00:28:45,975
Take the first
street on the right,

375
00:28:46,059 --> 00:28:47,685
then left on
the very next street.

376
00:28:47,852 --> 00:28:50,563
Go straight until you
come to a set of steps.

377
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:54,025
There's a red corridor.
It's a lane.

378
00:28:54,192 --> 00:28:56,528
When you exit the lane,
there's a cab stand.

379
00:28:56,694 --> 00:28:57,946
Go back to the hotel.

380
00:28:58,112 --> 00:29:00,573
Get Kim. Get the head
of hotel security...

381
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:03,451
and demand that he
cordon off your room.

382
00:29:03,618 --> 00:29:05,745
Do not open
the door for anyone.

383
00:29:05,912 --> 00:29:08,832
No room service, no police, no one.
You wait for me.

384
00:29:08,998 --> 00:29:10,583
I can't believe
this is happening.

385
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:11,751
I need you to focus.

386
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:17,006
Are you ready?

387
00:29:17,173 --> 00:29:18,049
No.

388
00:29:18,216 --> 00:29:20,218
I need you to be ready.
I need you to be ready.

389
00:29:20,385 --> 00:29:21,511
Come on, focus.

390
00:29:21,678 --> 00:29:22,804
Driver, stop.

391
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:25,807
Okay, go.

392
00:29:25,974 --> 00:29:27,433
Wait, what about you?

393
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,601
I'll be fine.

394
00:29:28,768 --> 00:29:31,088
It's the guys following us who
are about to have a problem.

395
00:29:31,187 --> 00:29:33,356
When a dog has a bone...

396
00:29:33,523 --> 00:29:35,804
the last thing you want to do
is try and take it from him.

397
00:29:41,447 --> 00:29:42,740
Be careful.

398
00:29:46,369 --> 00:29:47,245
Out of the car.

399
00:29:48,162 --> 00:29:50,748
Come on. Move,
move, move!

400
00:29:54,252 --> 00:29:55,920
Sir! Please.

401
00:29:56,629 --> 00:29:58,298
Please. Sir!

402
00:30:01,426 --> 00:30:02,260
He knows.

403
00:30:03,136 --> 00:30:04,470
Do it now.

404
00:30:23,698 --> 00:30:24,490
Come on.

405
00:30:46,429 --> 00:30:47,263
Shit.

406
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:03,112
Come on, Kim,
answer the goddamn phone.

407
00:31:52,662 --> 00:31:53,746
He's gone!

408
00:32:05,508 --> 00:32:07,927
Oh, God, no!
Somebody help me!

409
00:32:08,094 --> 00:32:10,138
The key!
Open the door, please!

410
00:32:11,723 --> 00:32:12,557
Shit!

411
00:34:23,604 --> 00:34:24,730
I'll blow his brains out.

412
00:34:31,779 --> 00:34:32,947
Oh, Bryan!

413
00:34:34,323 --> 00:34:35,157
Please!

414
00:34:35,658 --> 00:34:36,993
Drop the gun.

415
00:34:40,997 --> 00:34:42,415
<i>I really wish you were here.</i>

416
00:34:42,582 --> 00:34:45,084
Me too. You have no idea.

417
00:34:46,502 --> 00:34:47,295
<i>What?</i>

418
00:34:47,962 --> 00:34:48,963
<i>My dad's calling.</i>

419
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,423
<i>He's on a date with my mom.</i>

420
00:34:53,009 --> 00:34:54,260
I'll call you right back.

421
00:34:54,427 --> 00:34:56,178
<i>Miss you. Bye.</i>

422
00:34:59,307 --> 00:35:00,349
How's it going?

423
00:35:00,516 --> 00:35:01,851
Listen to me carefully, Kim.

424
00:35:03,686 --> 00:35:06,272
Your mother and I...

425
00:35:06,439 --> 00:35:07,940
are going to be taken.

426
00:35:09,483 --> 00:35:10,359
Daddy!

427
00:35:10,818 --> 00:35:12,028
Oh, my God.

428
00:35:12,194 --> 00:35:14,155
And people are going to
come for you, too.

429
00:35:14,447 --> 00:35:17,033
<i>Leave the place
where you are calmly.</i>

430
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:19,160
<i>Go to where the book
is I told you about.</i>

431
00:35:19,327 --> 00:35:22,872
There's a door. Go into the
room and hide in the closet.

432
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:25,041
<i>You got that?</i>
Yes.

433
00:35:25,207 --> 00:35:26,876
Good. I'll call you.

434
00:35:27,043 --> 00:35:29,545
Go, now.

435
00:35:41,515 --> 00:35:42,391
No!

436
00:35:43,851 --> 00:35:44,810
No!

437
00:35:54,195 --> 00:35:55,071
No!

438
00:36:13,089 --> 00:36:15,549
She is in room 422.

439
00:36:16,258 --> 00:36:17,593
No! No!

440
00:36:32,316 --> 00:36:35,277
<i>One, two, three...</i>

441
00:36:35,444 --> 00:36:37,947
<i>four, five, six.</i>

442
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:40,783
<i>Right turn.</i>

443
00:36:43,953 --> 00:36:45,246
<i>Man singing.</i>

444
00:36:56,507 --> 00:36:58,968
<i>One, two, three...</i>

445
00:37:02,096 --> 00:37:03,305
<i>four.</i>

446
00:37:03,973 --> 00:37:05,141
Boat.

447
00:37:15,109 --> 00:37:15,818
The pool!

448
00:37:26,662 --> 00:37:27,830
Security, fourth floor.

449
00:37:27,997 --> 00:37:28,998
<i>Do you copy me?</i>

450
00:37:29,498 --> 00:37:30,833
<i>Send someone now.</i>

451
00:37:31,542 --> 00:37:32,376
<i>25...</i>

452
00:37:33,544 --> 00:37:35,671
<i>26... 27...</i>

453
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:37,965
<i>28...</i>

454
00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:39,842
29.

455
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:40,801
Stop.

456
00:37:50,853 --> 00:37:51,687
She's not here.

457
00:37:51,896 --> 00:37:53,856
- Not here?
<i>- Check her dad's room.</i>

458
00:38:20,925 --> 00:38:22,635
<i>Hammer on metal.</i>

459
00:38:35,106 --> 00:38:37,525
<i>Left. Gear shift
to second.</i>

460
00:38:37,691 --> 00:38:40,277
<i>One, two, three.</i>

461
00:38:42,196 --> 00:38:43,405
Birds.

462
00:38:53,415 --> 00:38:54,333
You have them?

463
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,793
Yes, <i>efendi</i>. Both.

464
00:39:00,422 --> 00:39:01,590
Take them to the shop.

465
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:25,573
Look!

466
00:39:25,781 --> 00:39:26,740
A flip-flop.

467
00:39:31,954 --> 00:39:32,830
You go left!

468
00:39:33,038 --> 00:39:33,539
C'mon!

469
00:39:43,382 --> 00:39:44,466
<i>Right turn.</i>

470
00:39:44,633 --> 00:39:45,593
<i>Twenty-seven.</i>

471
00:39:48,804 --> 00:39:49,638
<i>Stop.</i>

472
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:58,022
No! No!

473
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:47,196
I shot some guy!

474
00:42:18,287 --> 00:42:20,331
Come on, Sam. Pick up.

475
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,834
<i>Hey, this is Sam.
Leave me a message.</i>

476
00:42:24,001 --> 00:42:24,793
Shit.

477
00:42:33,302 --> 00:42:34,470
Are you guys okay?

478
00:42:34,636 --> 00:42:36,972
No, no.
Are you all right?

479
00:42:37,139 --> 00:42:38,474
Yes.

480
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,642
I'm just scared.

481
00:42:40,809 --> 00:42:43,187
Kim, listen to me
very carefully.

482
00:42:44,146 --> 00:42:46,648
I need you to calm
down and pull yourself together.

483
00:42:46,982 --> 00:42:47,816
Okay.

484
00:42:47,983 --> 00:42:51,028
The men who came for you,
did they leave?

485
00:42:51,195 --> 00:42:53,864
Yes. What do they want?

486
00:42:54,031 --> 00:42:55,324
I'm going to find out.

487
00:42:55,657 --> 00:42:57,076
Is Mom okay?

488
00:43:00,329 --> 00:43:01,246
Dad.

489
00:43:02,164 --> 00:43:03,332
Mom's fine.

490
00:43:03,499 --> 00:43:04,666
<i>Okay.</i>

491
00:43:05,417 --> 00:43:06,835
What are we going to do?

492
00:43:07,336 --> 00:43:10,672
I want you to go to the U.S. Embassy.
You'll be safe there.

493
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:12,424
What about you and Mom?

494
00:43:14,051 --> 00:43:16,762
I'll figure something out.

495
00:43:17,346 --> 00:43:18,389
Where are you now?

496
00:43:18,764 --> 00:43:20,391
I don't really know, Kim.

497
00:43:21,016 --> 00:43:23,060
<i>Dad, how can I tell them
where to find you, then?</i>

498
00:43:23,227 --> 00:43:25,020
You can't.
Now get going.

499
00:43:25,229 --> 00:43:26,105
No.

500
00:43:26,522 --> 00:43:27,356
Kimmie...

501
00:43:27,523 --> 00:43:29,441
No. Tell me what to do.

502
00:43:30,567 --> 00:43:31,402
No, Kim.

503
00:43:31,568 --> 00:43:33,445
Dad, if you tell me what
to do, I can do it.

504
00:43:33,862 --> 00:43:34,863
Kim, this is not a game.

505
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:37,533
I know that.
It's my parents' lives.

506
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:40,369
<i>Dad, please.</i>

507
00:43:40,536 --> 00:43:42,746
You're wasting time.

508
00:43:46,875 --> 00:43:47,876
<i>Please.</i>

509
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:49,711
Tell me what to do.

510
00:43:51,213 --> 00:43:53,632
Can you get out of
the closet safely?

511
00:43:59,054 --> 00:43:59,763
Yes.

512
00:44:00,889 --> 00:44:03,809
If you can,
take the case with you.

513
00:44:04,893 --> 00:44:05,769
Okay.

514
00:44:17,072 --> 00:44:17,781
I'm out.

515
00:44:18,073 --> 00:44:23,454
The combination
is 23-28-84.

516
00:44:30,502 --> 00:44:31,670
<i>Is it open?</i>
Yeah.

517
00:44:31,837 --> 00:44:33,589
Okay. Do you see a map?

518
00:44:33,755 --> 00:44:34,465
Yeah.

519
00:44:34,631 --> 00:44:35,632
<i>Take the map.</i>

520
00:44:36,008 --> 00:44:38,260
You'll see a scale on
the top in kilometers.

521
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:39,511
<i>Do you see it?</i>

522
00:44:41,597 --> 00:44:43,140
Yeah, I see it.

523
00:44:43,307 --> 00:44:45,434
Take a shoelace from one
of my shoes in the closet.

524
00:44:45,809 --> 00:44:47,686
<i>Use it as a guide.</i>

525
00:44:50,772 --> 00:44:52,107
<i>There's a pen in the case.</i>

526
00:44:52,274 --> 00:44:53,358
<i>Take it.</i>

527
00:44:54,651 --> 00:44:57,321
Draw a circle with the
hotel in the center of it.

528
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:00,282
<i>It's done.</i>

529
00:45:00,449 --> 00:45:02,284
Make the diameter
three kilometers.

530
00:45:03,452 --> 00:45:04,495
<i>You got that?</i>

531
00:45:13,045 --> 00:45:13,879
<i>It's done.</i>

532
00:45:14,046 --> 00:45:16,006
Draw another circle with
the market in the center.

533
00:45:18,967 --> 00:45:19,551
<i>Okay.</i>

534
00:45:19,718 --> 00:45:21,637
Do the circles
intersect at any points?

535
00:45:21,803 --> 00:45:23,013
<i>No.</i>

536
00:45:24,681 --> 00:45:26,308
Now, take one of
those little cans,

537
00:45:26,391 --> 00:45:27,976
<i>the ones with
the pins on the top.</i>

538
00:45:28,477 --> 00:45:29,311
<i>It's a grenade.</i>

539
00:45:29,478 --> 00:45:31,980
I want you to go to the
balcony with the grenade.

540
00:45:33,815 --> 00:45:35,984
<i>Is there a safe place
you can throw it?</i>

541
00:45:39,696 --> 00:45:40,906
There's a parking garage.

542
00:45:41,073 --> 00:45:42,241
Anyone on it?

543
00:45:42,908 --> 00:45:43,742
No.

544
00:45:43,909 --> 00:45:45,789
I want you to pull the pin
out of the grenade...

545
00:45:45,911 --> 00:45:47,496
<i>count to three
so I can hear it,</i>

546
00:45:47,579 --> 00:45:49,164
then toss it as far as you can.

547
00:45:49,331 --> 00:45:51,041
<i>And then run back
into the room.</i>

548
00:45:51,208 --> 00:45:53,919
Keep the phone on so I
can hear the explosion.

549
00:45:56,588 --> 00:45:57,422
One...

550
00:45:57,839 --> 00:45:58,674
<i>two...</i>

551
00:45:58,924 --> 00:45:59,591
three.

552
00:46:08,183 --> 00:46:10,894
One, two, three...

553
00:46:15,023 --> 00:46:15,857
Dad?

554
00:46:16,024 --> 00:46:19,403
Now draw a circle on the map
with the hotel in the middle...

555
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:23,031
and the circumference
at 4.5 kilometers.

556
00:46:30,038 --> 00:46:32,749
Do the circles
intersect at any points?

557
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:34,793
Yeah, at two points.

558
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,920
I'm at one of the two
intersecting points.

559
00:46:37,087 --> 00:46:40,799
Now go outside and look at
the flags on the rooftops.

560
00:46:41,633 --> 00:46:43,427
<i>Do you see the flags?</i>

561
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:47,055
Yes.
Are they in the wind?

562
00:46:48,056 --> 00:46:50,058
Yeah.
Going east, right?

563
00:46:52,102 --> 00:46:53,562
I think so, yeah.
How did you know?

564
00:46:53,729 --> 00:46:54,771
Now look at the map.

565
00:46:54,938 --> 00:46:58,900
I want you to go to the point where
the circles intersect at the east.

566
00:46:59,067 --> 00:47:00,652
I want you to take
one of the guns,

567
00:47:00,736 --> 00:47:02,404
<i>get to a rooftop,
wait for my call.</i>

568
00:47:02,571 --> 00:47:03,905
And two of the grenades.

569
00:47:04,072 --> 00:47:07,993
Go to the rooftop at
the most easterly point.

570
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:10,162
Get up to the rooftop.

571
00:47:10,495 --> 00:47:11,788
<i>Wait for my call.</i>

572
00:47:12,414 --> 00:47:14,750
Be casual, Kim.
Blend in.

573
00:47:15,167 --> 00:47:16,585
Okay.

574
00:47:19,087 --> 00:47:19,963
Dad?

575
00:47:22,424 --> 00:47:23,592
<i>Dad?</i>

576
00:48:27,572 --> 00:48:28,782
Who are you?

577
00:48:29,324 --> 00:48:31,618
Those clothes don't belong to you.

578
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:32,869
Help!

579
00:48:33,328 --> 00:48:35,080
There's a thief in here!

580
00:49:38,643 --> 00:49:40,395
You know this man?

581
00:49:47,402 --> 00:49:48,904
This one?

582
00:49:50,155 --> 00:49:51,156
This one?

583
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,408
No.

584
00:49:54,493 --> 00:49:56,203
This one?

585
00:49:57,162 --> 00:49:58,163
What do you want?

586
00:49:58,330 --> 00:49:59,915
You recognize none of them.

587
00:50:00,081 --> 00:50:01,583
To you, they were nothing.

588
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:03,919
But to other people...

589
00:50:05,086 --> 00:50:08,673
they are sons and grandsons.

590
00:50:09,007 --> 00:50:11,259
Fathers and husbands.

591
00:50:11,426 --> 00:50:13,428
And you killed them all.

592
00:50:14,930 --> 00:50:17,724
Like they were
so many nothings.

593
00:50:23,939 --> 00:50:25,899
And this one?

594
00:50:27,442 --> 00:50:29,110
You recognize him?

595
00:50:29,528 --> 00:50:31,613
You do recognize him.

596
00:50:32,113 --> 00:50:35,450
Him, you didn’t just kill.
Him, you strapped to a chair.

597
00:50:35,617 --> 00:50:38,328
You attached electric
cables to the chair.

598
00:50:38,495 --> 00:50:40,372
You turned the current on...

599
00:50:40,539 --> 00:50:44,209
and you left it on
until his heart burst.

600
00:50:44,376 --> 00:50:48,838
He's the one who kidnapped dozens
of girls and ruined their lives.

601
00:50:49,005 --> 00:50:50,840
He was my son.

602
00:50:51,675 --> 00:50:55,095
Marko, from Tropojë.

603
00:50:55,929 --> 00:51:00,016
And I have come to
take you to Tropojë...

604
00:51:00,183 --> 00:51:03,812
to face you to the people
whose lives you have ruined.

605
00:51:03,979 --> 00:51:05,188
To give them justice.

606
00:51:05,355 --> 00:51:07,065
You mean to give them revenge.

607
00:51:07,232 --> 00:51:11,361
It if gives us peace
call it anything you wish.

608
00:51:11,945 --> 00:51:15,240
I killed your son because
he kidnapped my daughter.

609
00:51:17,534 --> 00:51:19,411
I don't care what he did!

610
00:51:21,371 --> 00:51:23,248
I only know...

611
00:51:23,415 --> 00:51:26,293
I will never see
his face again.

612
00:51:26,459 --> 00:51:29,004
I will never hear his voice.

613
00:51:34,384 --> 00:51:37,304
And as you held him responsible
for your daughter...

614
00:51:37,470 --> 00:51:39,097
I hold you responsible for him.

615
00:51:41,057 --> 00:51:43,351
Your death will not be quick.

616
00:51:43,518 --> 00:51:45,186
It will not be pleasant.

617
00:51:45,353 --> 00:51:46,646
But before you die...

618
00:51:46,813 --> 00:51:48,607
this is what you will see.

619
00:51:49,649 --> 00:51:51,151
Bring her in.

620
00:52:01,036 --> 00:52:03,038
Bryan...

621
00:52:26,895 --> 00:52:30,523
How long will it take for the
blood to rush to her head...

622
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:32,192
and have no place to go?

623
00:52:35,445 --> 00:52:37,697
About 30 minutes.

624
00:52:37,864 --> 00:52:40,575
You are right.
You're an expert for this.

625
00:52:40,742 --> 00:52:43,119
So you have 30 minutes
to watch her die.

626
00:52:43,286 --> 00:52:45,747
She had nothing
to do with this.

627
00:52:45,914 --> 00:52:47,832
Do what you want with me.
Let her go.

628
00:52:48,083 --> 00:52:49,751
Don't play the hero with me.

629
00:52:49,918 --> 00:52:51,836
Now we are going to
catch your daughter.

630
00:52:52,003 --> 00:52:55,256
She will be sold to the
lowest brothel in this world.

631
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:56,883
No! No!

632
00:52:57,050 --> 00:53:00,345
She will be abused
by so many men...

633
00:53:00,512 --> 00:53:05,266
that she'll be nothing more than a
piece of meat a dog would not have.

634
00:53:20,073 --> 00:53:21,700
Don't listen to them, Lennie.

635
00:53:22,367 --> 00:53:23,368
Kim is safe.

636
00:53:23,535 --> 00:53:24,619
I spoke with her.

637
00:53:25,078 --> 00:53:26,329
She's safe.

638
00:53:26,663 --> 00:53:29,374
You have to stay calm.
Breathe slowly.

639
00:53:29,541 --> 00:53:30,542
You have to.

640
00:53:30,709 --> 00:53:32,877
I won't let anything
happen to you, or to her.

641
00:53:33,044 --> 00:53:34,087
I promise.

642
00:53:39,968 --> 00:53:41,219
<i>Hello, Murad?</i>
Shh!

643
00:53:41,761 --> 00:53:42,762
Quiet.

644
00:53:42,929 --> 00:53:44,139
<i>We lost the girl.</i>

645
00:53:45,432 --> 00:53:46,474
The girl has gone.

646
00:53:46,641 --> 00:53:48,561
I'll be back as soon as
we get her, then we move.

647
00:53:49,227 --> 00:53:50,061
Come on!

648
00:53:51,813 --> 00:53:53,148
Hold on, Lennie.

649
00:54:15,128 --> 00:54:16,796
Hold on, Lennie.
Hold on.

650
00:54:22,677 --> 00:54:24,012
What's he doing?

651
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,015
Get out of the way!

652
00:54:28,141 --> 00:54:29,809
Sorry! Sorry!

653
00:54:29,976 --> 00:54:32,103
Come back!
You have to pay!

654
00:54:35,148 --> 00:54:36,107
Lennie.

655
00:54:37,776 --> 00:54:38,693
Lennie.

656
00:54:48,203 --> 00:54:51,289
I'm with you, baby.
I'm here. I'm here.

657
00:55:15,230 --> 00:55:17,315
Come on. Call.

658
00:55:18,149 --> 00:55:19,734
Please, come on.

659
00:55:21,069 --> 00:55:21,861
Lennie.

660
00:55:22,028 --> 00:55:22,821
Bryan.

661
00:55:22,987 --> 00:55:25,073
Lennie. Lennie.

662
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:26,825
I'm coming back.

663
00:55:38,670 --> 00:55:39,671
Please.

664
00:55:39,754 --> 00:55:41,130
I'm here.

665
00:55:41,214 --> 00:55:42,257
Set off another grenade.

666
00:56:01,442 --> 00:56:03,152
Dad?
You're close.

667
00:56:03,486 --> 00:56:05,530
I want you to keep moving east.

668
00:56:05,697 --> 00:56:08,074
Count to 30 and then
set off another one.

669
00:56:08,241 --> 00:56:10,702
One, two, three...

670
00:56:14,998 --> 00:56:16,541
18,19...

671
00:56:19,627 --> 00:56:21,379
26, 27...

672
00:56:21,546 --> 00:56:23,548
28, 29...

673
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:25,133
30.

674
00:56:31,222 --> 00:56:32,932
Go out and check
what's going on.

675
00:56:40,273 --> 00:56:42,108
Kim.
<i>Yeah.</i>

676
00:56:42,275 --> 00:56:45,653
Look east. Look for a
white cloud of steam.

677
00:56:47,655 --> 00:56:48,656
I see it.

678
00:56:48,823 --> 00:56:50,283
Run to it. Tell me
when you're there.

679
00:57:00,168 --> 00:57:01,169
I'm going down.

680
00:57:18,269 --> 00:57:19,979
Dad.
Where are you?

681
00:57:20,146 --> 00:57:21,147
I'm right by the steam.

682
00:57:21,314 --> 00:57:23,191
<i>Drop the gun down the vent.</i>

683
00:57:23,358 --> 00:57:25,026
Oh, God, they're here.
They're coming.

684
00:57:25,193 --> 00:57:26,903
Drop the gun, Kim, and run.

685
00:57:29,739 --> 00:57:30,573
Go.

686
00:57:30,865 --> 00:57:32,659
<i>Dad! They're coming.</i>

687
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:08,236
I'm coming back.

688
01:00:00,848 --> 01:00:02,809
Drop that.

689
01:00:04,519 --> 01:00:05,436
On your knees!

690
01:00:09,273 --> 01:00:10,566
Don't do this.

691
01:00:10,817 --> 01:00:12,235
Please.

692
01:00:23,204 --> 01:00:24,914
Dad?

693
01:00:25,373 --> 01:00:27,500
Dad! Dad!

694
01:00:28,876 --> 01:00:30,002
Baby.

695
01:00:34,632 --> 01:00:35,633
Where's Mom?
Is she okay?

696
01:00:35,842 --> 01:00:38,553
She's safe.
She's safe.

697
01:00:48,563 --> 01:00:50,106
Slow down,
slow down, slow down.

698
01:00:53,776 --> 01:00:54,944
I've got a fare.

699
01:01:00,533 --> 01:01:01,367
I'll be back.

700
01:01:10,418 --> 01:01:12,461
That man had the same
tattoo as the men in Paris.

701
01:01:12,628 --> 01:01:15,089
It's not you they want, Kim.
It's me.

702
01:01:30,688 --> 01:01:33,149
I want you to wait here.
I'm going to get Mom.

703
01:01:33,316 --> 01:01:35,443
Wait five minutes,
and if I don't show up...

704
01:01:35,610 --> 01:01:39,113
I want you to go straight here,
to the American Embassy.

705
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:41,616
Tell them what happened. Dad...

706
01:01:41,782 --> 01:01:43,062
No time, Kim.
Give me your phone.

707
01:01:43,659 --> 01:01:46,495
You wait five minutes,
not a moment longer.

708
01:01:46,662 --> 01:01:49,165
No matter what happens,
time runs out, you go.

709
01:01:49,332 --> 01:01:50,666
You understand me?

710
01:01:51,626 --> 01:01:52,793
Okay.

711
01:03:28,973 --> 01:03:29,974
No!

712
01:03:31,392 --> 01:03:32,226
No.

713
01:03:33,477 --> 01:03:34,145
Bryan!

714
01:03:53,748 --> 01:03:54,582
Yes?

715
01:04:21,150 --> 01:04:21,859
Move!

716
01:04:22,026 --> 01:04:23,778
You killed him.
I had no choice. Move.

717
01:04:23,944 --> 01:04:25,988
Where's Mom? She's
fine, she's not far.

718
01:04:26,155 --> 01:04:28,032
Where is she?
Come on, move!

719
01:04:30,618 --> 01:04:32,219
I don't want to do this.
Keep going, Kim.

720
01:04:32,286 --> 01:04:33,120
Where are we going?

721
01:04:33,287 --> 01:04:35,623
Go straight. We have
to go to the Embassy.

722
01:04:38,292 --> 01:04:39,502
I'm not sure I can.

723
01:04:39,668 --> 01:04:41,462
Do you know how to shoot? No.

724
01:04:41,629 --> 01:04:42,630
Then drive.

725
01:04:50,012 --> 01:04:51,388
They escaped.

726
01:04:54,141 --> 01:04:55,643
<i>Officer down in Balat.</i>

727
01:04:55,851 --> 01:04:56,560
Copy.

728
01:04:57,686 --> 01:04:58,521
Shit, cops.

729
01:05:00,231 --> 01:05:00,981
I have to stop.

730
01:05:01,148 --> 01:05:03,317
No, I just shot one of them.
Now, go.

731
01:05:11,534 --> 01:05:12,660
Come on, go!

732
01:05:35,683 --> 01:05:36,725
Right.

733
01:05:42,022 --> 01:05:43,190
Back, back, back!

734
01:05:44,525 --> 01:05:46,026
Come on, move!

735
01:05:48,279 --> 01:05:49,446
Come on, Kim.

736
01:05:57,204 --> 01:05:58,455
Go, go!

737
01:06:00,124 --> 01:06:01,542
Faster.

738
01:06:05,212 --> 01:06:06,130
Keep going.

739
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:20,102
Left!
Yeah.

740
01:06:22,605 --> 01:06:23,647
They're in the taxi!

741
01:06:26,567 --> 01:06:28,068
Keep going.

742
01:06:30,237 --> 01:06:31,238
Oh, no.
Shit.

743
01:06:31,405 --> 01:06:32,823
Stay low. Keep going.

744
01:06:37,328 --> 01:06:38,787
Come on, faster.
I can't.

745
01:06:38,954 --> 01:06:40,915
You can do it!
I can't!

746
01:06:42,625 --> 01:06:44,501
Come on, move! Move.

747
01:06:45,461 --> 01:06:46,587
Dad!
Keep going.

748
01:06:47,129 --> 01:06:47,963
Move!

749
01:06:49,089 --> 01:06:50,090
Right.

750
01:07:02,144 --> 01:07:03,145
Oh, shit.

751
01:07:05,856 --> 01:07:06,857
No!

752
01:07:29,129 --> 01:07:30,506
Come on, Kim. Move!

753
01:07:34,009 --> 01:07:35,260
Go!
I'm trying.

754
01:07:43,435 --> 01:07:44,520
Come on, keep going.

755
01:07:47,272 --> 01:07:48,232
Turn left.

756
01:07:57,616 --> 01:07:58,659
Shit.

757
01:08:00,244 --> 01:08:01,120
Dad!

758
01:08:01,286 --> 01:08:02,955
Keep going. Stay low.

759
01:08:15,718 --> 01:08:17,428
Faster, Kim.
I can't.

760
01:08:22,975 --> 01:08:24,268
Come on, faster!
Dad!

761
01:08:24,435 --> 01:08:25,769
Keep going.

762
01:08:29,273 --> 01:08:30,473
You can make it.

763
01:08:31,775 --> 01:08:32,735
Do it.

764
01:08:57,009 --> 01:08:58,510
Here! Don't stop.

765
01:08:58,677 --> 01:08:59,595
But the soldiers.

766
01:08:59,762 --> 01:09:01,013
They'll move.

767
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:04,391
Down, Kim!

768
01:09:23,952 --> 01:09:24,995
<i>Nobody shoot.</i>

769
01:09:25,287 --> 01:09:26,705
<i>It's a suicide bomber.</i>

770
01:09:31,001 --> 01:09:32,795
Are you okay?

771
01:09:32,961 --> 01:09:34,004
Yeah.

772
01:09:37,049 --> 01:09:39,343
Keep your head down, Kimmie.

773
01:09:46,850 --> 01:09:47,684
Hey, Bry.

774
01:09:47,851 --> 01:09:51,063
<i>Sam, we're in a courtyard of the U.
S. Embassy in Istanbul...</i>

775
01:09:51,230 --> 01:09:52,606
in a smashed-up car.

776
01:09:52,940 --> 01:09:53,774
<i>Don't ask.</i>

777
01:09:53,941 --> 01:09:56,235
Can you call someone to make
sure we don't get shot?

778
01:09:56,401 --> 01:09:57,444
Yeah, of course.

779
01:09:57,611 --> 01:09:59,071
<i>Thanks.</i>

780
01:09:59,238 --> 01:10:01,615
It's Bry. He's in
trouble in Istanbul.

781
01:10:03,867 --> 01:10:06,078
Mom didn't get away, did she?

782
01:10:08,539 --> 01:10:09,540
No.

783
01:10:09,706 --> 01:10:11,375
Oh, God, Dad.

784
01:10:11,542 --> 01:10:12,835
Tell me the truth.
Is she...

785
01:10:13,001 --> 01:10:15,629
No, no, no, Kim.
No, she's not.

786
01:10:16,713 --> 01:10:19,925
But they have her.

787
01:10:20,092 --> 01:10:23,303
And they will use her until
they get what they want.

788
01:10:24,388 --> 01:10:25,180
Me.

789
01:10:27,766 --> 01:10:31,311
You'll be safe here in the
Embassy until I come back.

790
01:10:31,645 --> 01:10:34,064
Kimmie, it's going to be okay.

791
01:10:34,231 --> 01:10:36,358
Nothing's okay.

792
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:38,902
Kim, listen.

793
01:10:40,988 --> 01:10:43,407
I have to find them...

794
01:10:43,574 --> 01:10:45,284
and bring your mom back.

795
01:10:45,450 --> 01:10:47,119
And then I have to
make sure these people

796
01:10:47,202 --> 01:10:48,871
never bother us
again in our lives.

797
01:10:50,289 --> 01:10:52,583
What are you going to do?

798
01:10:56,128 --> 01:10:58,088
What I do best.

799
01:11:29,953 --> 01:11:31,496
Mrs. Mills.

800
01:11:33,207 --> 01:11:36,293
What should I do
with you, Mrs. Mills?

801
01:12:35,227 --> 01:12:37,479
I have nothing against you.

802
01:12:37,646 --> 01:12:39,898
You didn't kill my son.

803
01:12:43,694 --> 01:12:46,863
But your husband did.

804
01:12:48,657 --> 01:12:51,410
Now, he betrayed
you by choosing

805
01:12:51,493 --> 01:12:54,496
to save your daughter
instead of you.

806
01:12:55,372 --> 01:12:57,916
He left you here like a dog.

807
01:12:59,876 --> 01:13:03,463
At least my daughter
is still alive.

808
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:23,483
Mrs. Mills,
you're a good mother...

809
01:13:24,735 --> 01:13:26,737
and a brave woman.

810
01:13:28,238 --> 01:13:31,158
For that, I'm going to
send you back home...

811
01:13:31,992 --> 01:13:34,828
piece by piece.

812
01:16:53,944 --> 01:16:55,153
Shut up!

813
01:17:44,578 --> 01:17:47,497
Ohri, shoot this dog.

814
01:18:06,349 --> 01:18:08,101
Go and see what's happened.

815
01:18:17,694 --> 01:18:20,030
Let's go. Move through
here, to the hammam.

816
01:18:20,447 --> 01:18:21,364
Hurry!

817
01:19:31,601 --> 01:19:32,811
Mirko!

818
01:19:33,019 --> 01:19:34,229
Mirko!

819
01:19:37,357 --> 01:19:38,733
You stay here.

820
01:19:40,527 --> 01:19:41,695
No!

821
01:20:21,860 --> 01:20:22,986
No.

822
01:20:59,439 --> 01:21:01,107
No. Bryan!

823
01:21:01,274 --> 01:21:03,109
Come on!

824
01:21:37,811 --> 01:21:38,645
You can't come in!

825
01:21:39,437 --> 01:21:40,480
Get lost.

826
01:22:30,446 --> 01:22:31,656
Lennie.

827
01:25:15,194 --> 01:25:16,571
Lennie.

828
01:25:19,115 --> 01:25:20,950
I'm here, baby.
I'm here.

829
01:25:21,284 --> 01:25:24,370
I'm coming back, Lennie.
I'm coming back.

830
01:25:24,454 --> 01:25:25,371
Okay?

831
01:26:04,577 --> 01:26:06,704
What are you waiting for?

832
01:26:07,747 --> 01:26:09,582
You have other sons?

833
01:26:10,917 --> 01:26:11,751
Two.

834
01:26:11,918 --> 01:26:15,880
And if I killed you, they
will come and seek revenge.

835
01:26:17,465 --> 01:26:19,634
They will, for sure.

836
01:26:19,801 --> 01:26:21,594
And I will kill them, too.

837
01:26:23,387 --> 01:26:25,431
You can change that.

838
01:26:25,598 --> 01:26:28,434
You can go home,
live your life.

839
01:26:28,768 --> 01:26:31,437
Enjoy your sons,
your grandsons.

840
01:26:32,980 --> 01:26:34,816
And my other son...

841
01:26:35,942 --> 01:26:37,652
Marko.

842
01:26:40,988 --> 01:26:43,157
The son you killed.

843
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:47,286
Am I supposed to
just forget it?

844
01:26:47,453 --> 01:26:48,287
No.

845
01:26:48,454 --> 01:26:50,706
You will just have
to live with it,

846
01:26:50,790 --> 01:26:52,959
like the parents of all
those kidnapped girls.

847
01:26:54,460 --> 01:26:56,963
Or you can die here.

848
01:26:57,296 --> 01:26:58,339
What are you telling me?

849
01:26:58,506 --> 01:27:03,010
What I'm saying is,
if you give me your word...

850
01:27:04,470 --> 01:27:08,975
I will throw down this gun
and simply walk away.

851
01:27:11,435 --> 01:27:12,645
Why?

852
01:27:13,104 --> 01:27:17,608
Because I am tired of it all.

853
01:28:25,843 --> 01:28:27,929
Lennie, I'm here.

854
01:28:28,971 --> 01:28:31,015
I'm here, baby.
I'm here.

855
01:28:31,933 --> 01:28:33,351
Come on, baby.

856
01:28:37,897 --> 01:28:40,358
It's okay. It's okay.

857
01:28:41,776 --> 01:28:43,194
It's okay.

858
01:28:44,236 --> 01:28:45,655
We're safe.

859
01:28:48,032 --> 01:28:49,492
Bryan...

860
01:28:50,701 --> 01:28:51,535
Kim.

861
01:28:52,161 --> 01:28:52,995
Kim...

862
01:28:53,162 --> 01:28:54,664
She's safe.

863
01:28:56,624 --> 01:28:57,917
She's safe.

864
01:29:08,135 --> 01:29:09,971
We're all safe.

865
01:29:35,871 --> 01:29:37,373
Okay.

866
01:29:39,792 --> 01:29:41,502
Line it up.

867
01:29:42,837 --> 01:29:44,630
That's it.

868
01:29:46,590 --> 01:29:48,050
Now, begin to cut.

869
01:29:48,217 --> 01:29:51,721
Not too fast, not too fast.

870
01:29:51,887 --> 01:29:55,850
Straighten it out.
Straighten, straighten.

871
01:29:57,810 --> 01:29:58,894
That's it.

872
01:29:59,061 --> 01:29:59,937
Stop, stop, stop.

873
01:30:01,397 --> 01:30:02,815
Perfect.

874
01:30:18,414 --> 01:30:20,499
Perfect score.

875
01:30:20,958 --> 01:30:22,376
Great!

876
01:30:23,753 --> 01:30:24,795
Congratulations.

877
01:30:24,962 --> 01:30:26,380
Thank you.

878
01:30:30,259 --> 01:30:31,886
I was perfect.

879
01:30:32,970 --> 01:30:35,848
I've been saying that
since the day you were born.

880
01:30:36,015 --> 01:30:38,059
Congratulations.

881
01:30:38,225 --> 01:30:40,895
So, what would you like
to do to celebrate?

882
01:30:41,687 --> 01:30:42,855
Um...

883
01:30:43,522 --> 01:30:44,443
I think I have an idea.

884
01:30:44,607 --> 01:30:45,608
Yeah?

885
01:30:45,775 --> 01:30:46,984
Yeah. I'll drive.

886
01:30:47,151 --> 01:30:48,527
Of course.

887
01:30:58,662 --> 01:31:01,540
<i>Don't knock it till you try it</i>

888
01:31:02,041 --> 01:31:04,168
<i>Just come out to LA...</i>

889
01:31:10,758 --> 01:31:13,302
Here you go.
Three double-chocolate fudge.

890
01:31:15,137 --> 01:31:16,180
Thank you.

891
01:31:16,263 --> 01:31:17,640
Who's having the strawberry?

892
01:31:17,807 --> 01:31:19,433
I'm sorry, but I
just ordered three.

893
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:21,560
Actually, the order said four.

894
01:31:21,977 --> 01:31:23,312
I ordered the fourth one.

895
01:31:23,479 --> 01:31:24,647
For who?

896
01:31:26,524 --> 01:31:27,817
Oh, Jamie.

897
01:31:27,983 --> 01:31:28,859
Hey.

898
01:31:30,069 --> 01:31:31,070
Hi.

899
01:31:31,153 --> 01:31:32,279
Hi. Perfect timing.

900
01:31:32,446 --> 01:31:33,614
Jamie.

901
01:31:34,406 --> 01:31:35,908
It's cool if he
joins us, right?

902
01:31:36,075 --> 01:31:37,076
Of course it is, honey.

903
01:31:37,535 --> 01:31:38,577
Dad?

904
01:31:40,621 --> 01:31:42,665
Of course it is, honey.
Behave.

905
01:31:42,832 --> 01:31:44,125
It's nice to see
you again, sir.

906
01:31:45,543 --> 01:31:47,837
Nice to see you, too.
Sit down.

907
01:31:48,629 --> 01:31:49,713
Hi.

908
01:31:49,797 --> 01:31:51,132
We got you a strawberry.

909
01:31:51,298 --> 01:31:52,216
Oh, please.

910
01:31:52,383 --> 01:31:53,300
Thanks, Dad.

911
01:31:53,467 --> 01:31:56,762
Don't shoot this one. I really like him.

912
01:32:15,614 --> 01:32:19,994
<i>You know I'm not one
to break promises</i>

913
01:32:23,122 --> 01:32:27,293
<i>I don't want to hurt you
but I need to breathe</i>

914
01:32:30,588 --> 01:32:34,884
<i>At the end of it all
you're still my best friend</i>

915
01:32:38,178 --> 01:32:42,975
<i>But there's something inside
that I need to release</i>

916
01:32:45,311 --> 01:32:48,814
<i>Which way is right
Which way is wrong</i>

917
01:32:49,148 --> 01:32:52,860
<i>How do I say that
I need to move on</i>

918
01:32:53,694 --> 01:33:00,034
<i>You know we're
headed separate ways</i>

919
01:33:00,117 --> 01:33:05,205
<i>And it feels like I am
just too close to love you</i>

920
01:33:08,667 --> 01:33:12,630
<i>There's nothing
I can really say</i>

921
01:33:16,008 --> 01:33:19,929
<i>I can't lie no more
I can't hide no more</i>

922
01:33:20,012 --> 01:33:22,222
<i>Got to be true to myself</i>

923
01:33:23,098 --> 01:33:28,187
<i>And it feels like I am
just too close to love you</i>

924
01:33:29,438 --> 01:33:31,523
<i>So I'll be on my way</i>

925
01:34:02,262 --> 01:34:06,558
<i>You gave me more
that I can return</i>

926
01:34:09,645 --> 01:34:14,566
<i>Yet there's oh, so much
that you deserve</i>

927
01:34:16,735 --> 01:34:20,114
<i>There's nothing to say
nothing to do</i>

928
01:34:20,447 --> 01:34:24,284
<i>I've nothing to give
I must leave without you</i>

929
