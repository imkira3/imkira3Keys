- Oh.
- Hmm.

163
00:11:17,961 --> 00:11:19,223
ASH: Max!

164
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:20,490
Sorry about my friend.

165
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:22,691
Max, what's gotten into you?

166
00:11:22,733 --> 00:11:23,927
Wait...

167
00:11:23,967 --> 00:11:25,730
Ladies and gentlemen!

168
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:29,637
It seems we have some volunteers
to help us with our next trick!

169
00:11:29,673 --> 00:11:31,903
Gentlemen, you must be
in show business...

170
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:33,534
because your timing
is impeccable!

171
00:11:33,577 --> 00:11:34,544
BOTH: Huh?

172
00:11:34,578 --> 00:11:36,842
Fellow magicians,
what are your names?

173
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,108
My name is Ash.

174
00:11:38,148 --> 00:11:39,979
I'm Max... the Great.

175
00:11:40,016 --> 00:11:41,040
Pikachu!

176
00:11:41,084 --> 00:11:42,142
Let's do it!

177
00:11:42,185 --> 00:11:44,813
Since you're obviously
great magicians...

178
00:11:44,855 --> 00:11:47,722
feast your eyes
on Butler's burning box!

179
00:11:47,758 --> 00:11:51,421
You must simply escape the box
before it bursts into flames!

180
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:53,588
- Burning box?
- Pika.

181
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,688
That's your cue.

182
00:11:54,731 --> 00:11:57,256
But, Diane,
we're not really magicians.

183
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,201
Yeah, yeah, sure.
And we're not really clowns.

184
00:12:00,237 --> 00:12:02,228
It's just not fair
that Max and Ash...

185
00:12:02,272 --> 00:12:04,001
get to be in the show
and I don't!

186
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,064
You said it!

187
00:12:05,108 --> 00:12:06,439
If there's anyone
who should be sharing...

188
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:09,741
the same stage as Diane,
it's me!

189
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:13,648
- Uhh...
- Ohh...

190
00:12:13,683 --> 00:12:16,277
BUTLER:
Dusclops, step forward!

191
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:18,287
Dusclops.

192
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:20,084
Dusclops.

193
00:12:20,123 --> 00:12:22,057
Dusclops.

194
00:12:22,092 --> 00:12:23,889
BUTLER: Real magicians
like Ash and Max...

195
00:12:23,927 --> 00:12:27,454
should have no trouble easily
escaping from a box like this.

196
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:29,055
So, to make it interesting...

197
00:12:29,099 --> 00:12:32,227
they only have ten seconds
'til Dusclops destroys it...

198
00:12:32,269 --> 00:12:33,930
with his hyperbeam!

199
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:35,198
Ten...

200
00:12:35,238 --> 00:12:36,796
Ooh, they're stuck
in a dark place...

201
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,740
with impending
doom and no way out.

202
00:12:38,775 --> 00:12:40,367
- Eight...
- That sounds like my life.

203
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:42,037
How are we supposed
to get out?

204
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:44,478
I don't know, Ash.
Must be some trick...

205
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:47,506
- five, four...
- I hope, or this could end bad.

206
00:12:47,551 --> 00:12:50,918
- Three...
- Dus...

207
00:12:50,954 --> 00:12:53,047
- two...
- Ooh!

208
00:12:53,089 --> 00:12:54,556
One!

209
00:12:54,591 --> 00:12:56,923
Dusclops, hyperbeam!

210
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,892
Dus!

211
00:13:00,463 --> 00:13:01,862
ALL: Oohh!

212
00:13:02,966 --> 00:13:05,366
Oohh!

213
00:13:09,439 --> 00:13:13,341
<i>Ohh... unh!</i>

214
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:16,504
Not only did they escape
from the box just in time...

215
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:20,038
but they made bouquets
of flowers appear as well!

216
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:21,914
Let's thank those
amazing magicians...

217
00:13:21,952 --> 00:13:24,113
Ash, Pikachu,
and Max the Great!

218
00:13:24,154 --> 00:13:27,055
[Fanfare]

219
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:30,457
Ha ha! Thank you!
Thank you!

220
00:13:30,493 --> 00:13:33,223
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

221
00:13:35,365 --> 00:13:36,855
Thank you!

222
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,731
Do you think they'll tell us
how they did it?

223
00:13:38,768 --> 00:13:41,362
Do you think they'll
introduce me to that girl Diane?

224
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:44,532
Aw! Yeah!

225
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:47,099
- Pikachu!
- Pika!

226
00:13:47,143 --> 00:13:49,008
Now that's magic!

227
00:13:49,045 --> 00:13:50,569
Pika...

228
00:13:50,614 --> 00:13:51,706
chuuuu!

229
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:54,911
Give it up! Your Pika-power
won't work in our zap-trap.

230
00:13:54,951 --> 00:13:56,782
Aah! Aah!

231
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,050
BOTH: And now
on with the show!

232
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:01,387
Team Rocket,
give me back my Pikachu!

233
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:03,051
Ladies and gentlemen...

234
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:04,958
For our final trick
of the evening...

235
00:14:04,995 --> 00:14:07,987
we're going to make
all the Pokémon disappear!

236
00:14:08,031 --> 00:14:10,431
This is the best part
of the show!

237
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:15,337
[All laughing]

238
00:14:18,675 --> 00:14:20,404
MEOWTH:
So who's the clowns now?!

239
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:21,774
You can keep our salary.

240
00:14:21,811 --> 00:14:24,109
We'll take our pay
in Pokémon!

241
00:14:24,147 --> 00:14:25,444
- No!
- No!

242
00:14:25,482 --> 00:14:26,506
Stop 'em!

243
00:14:26,549 --> 00:14:28,642
- I'll get 'em...
- I'll do it!

244
00:14:28,685 --> 00:14:29,879
Behold!

245
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,083
We have one final performance
as our encore!

246
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:34,590
Now, Dusclops...

247
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:35,818
Capitata!

248
00:14:35,859 --> 00:14:39,852
Dus... clops!

249
00:14:39,896 --> 00:14:41,124
Aah!

250
00:14:42,933 --> 00:14:44,161
Pika!

251
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,360
Pikachu!

252
00:14:47,938 --> 00:14:49,098
Pika!

253
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:51,903
Ha! Let's have
an encore of our own!

254
00:14:51,942 --> 00:14:55,503
Pika... chu!

255
00:14:58,348 --> 00:15:00,373
Rahr.

256
00:15:00,417 --> 00:15:03,545
No magic show would be complete
without a vanishing act...

257
00:15:03,586 --> 00:15:05,713
and so we saved
the best for last.

258
00:15:05,755 --> 00:15:07,916
Dusclops, use Night Shade!

259
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:10,756
Dus... clops!

260
00:15:10,794 --> 00:15:14,890
Looks like Team Rocket's
blasting off again.

261
00:15:14,931 --> 00:15:17,798
Bravo! Bravo!

262
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:21,065
Everyone thinks that Team Rocket
was part of the show.

263
00:15:21,104 --> 00:15:23,197
Yeah. But they won't be back
for a curtain call.

264
00:15:23,239 --> 00:15:26,072
[Ash and Max laughing]

265
00:15:26,109 --> 00:15:30,205
Ha ha...

266
00:15:30,249 --> 00:15:31,273
[Screaming]

267
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,678
<i>ASH: Jirachi?</i>

268
00:15:35,721 --> 00:15:37,655
Mm-hmm.
According to the legend...

269
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:40,386
Jirachi is a very special
Pokémon that awakens...

270
00:15:40,426 --> 00:15:43,520
just once every thousand years.

271
00:15:43,562 --> 00:15:47,328
I think... it's sleeping
right inside here.

272
00:15:47,366 --> 00:15:48,890
BROCK: It's like a cocoon.

273
00:15:48,934 --> 00:15:50,595
- Awesome.
- Pika.

274
00:15:50,636 --> 00:15:52,001
Oh, that's amazing.

275
00:15:52,037 --> 00:15:54,301
So the voice that Max heard...

276
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:58,276
Yes. It is said that in order
to awaken from its slumber...

277
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:01,177
Jirachi needs for
two things to happen:

278
00:16:01,213 --> 00:16:04,182
The Millennium Comet must be
visible in the night sky...

279
00:16:04,216 --> 00:16:07,310
and Jirachi must find itself...
a friend.

280
00:16:07,353 --> 00:16:09,184
It needs a friend?

281
00:16:09,221 --> 00:16:11,382
Is that why
it was talking to Max?

282
00:16:11,423 --> 00:16:13,891
So now we just need
the Millennium Comet.

283
00:16:13,926 --> 00:16:15,291
Hmm, and that's tonight.

284
00:16:15,327 --> 00:16:16,294
Aww!

285
00:16:16,328 --> 00:16:19,229
Hello... Jirachi.

286
00:16:23,235 --> 00:16:24,827
First, Max was
hearing things...

287
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:26,770
and now he's made friends
with a big rock.

288
00:16:26,805 --> 00:16:28,067
Cut it out!

289
00:16:28,107 --> 00:16:29,904
You're just jealous
that Jirachi chose me...

290
00:16:29,942 --> 00:16:31,807
to talk to as his friend
instead of you!

291
00:16:31,844 --> 00:16:35,371
They also say Jirachi has
the power to grant wishes...

292
00:16:35,414 --> 00:16:39,373
but it can't do anything without
first having you as its friend.

293
00:16:39,418 --> 00:16:41,113
Oh, OK, I'll do it.

294
00:16:41,153 --> 00:16:42,677
Max, meet Jirachi.

295
00:16:42,721 --> 00:16:43,881
How do you do?

296
00:16:43,922 --> 00:16:45,890
- Aww...
- Pika.

297
00:16:45,924 --> 00:16:48,757
Wow. Max, can I see
what it feels like?

298
00:16:48,794 --> 00:16:50,284
Let me see!

299
00:16:50,329 --> 00:16:52,991
I thought it's crazy
to be friends with a rock!

300
00:16:53,032 --> 00:16:57,366
Yeah, well, I was just kidding.
Please, let me just hold it.

301
00:16:57,403 --> 00:16:58,597
No way!

302
00:16:58,637 --> 00:17:00,036
Hey, get back here!

303
00:17:00,072 --> 00:17:01,198
<i>MAX: I can't hear you!</i>

304

<i>MAY: I said I was sorry!</i>

305
00:17:02,574 --> 00:17:04,542
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

[Riders screaming]

307
00:17:14,887 --> 00:17:17,481
MAY: Wow, look at this!

308
00:17:17,523 --> 00:17:19,457
You have excellent taste,
young lady.

309
00:17:19,491 --> 00:17:21,049
That's a wishing star.

310
00:17:21,093 --> 00:17:22,355
A wishing star?

311
00:17:22,394 --> 00:17:24,658
It works with
the Millennium Comet.

312
00:17:24,697 --> 00:17:27,530
On each of the seven nights
that the comet appears...

313
00:17:27,566 --> 00:17:30,034
all you have to do is fold down
one of the sections...

314
00:17:30,069 --> 00:17:31,331
and make a wish.

315
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:33,270
ALL: Ohh.

316
00:17:33,305 --> 00:17:37,537
If you do it all seven nights,
then your wish will come true.

317
00:17:37,576 --> 00:17:39,168
Wow! I'll take it!

318
00:17:39,211 --> 00:17:40,735
A wise choice.

319
00:17:40,779 --> 00:17:44,146
But you only get one wish,
so make it count.

320
00:17:44,183 --> 00:17:45,343
Uhh.

321
00:17:48,787 --> 00:17:50,482
Whoa. Would you look at that!

322
00:17:50,522 --> 00:17:52,717
Won't be long
before the comet appears.

323
00:17:54,626 --> 00:17:56,924
Can you see that, Jirachi?

324
00:17:56,962 --> 00:17:58,657
