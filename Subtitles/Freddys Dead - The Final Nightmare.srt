2
00:01:33,924 --> 00:01:35,186
This is the pilot speaking.

3
00:01:35,225 --> 00:01:37,750
You'll notice the "fasten
seat belts" sign is on.

4
00:01:37,794 --> 00:01:39,887
Passing through
a little turbulence here.

5
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:43,388
Unfortunately,
we can't get up over it...

6
00:01:43,433 --> 00:01:45,560
and we can't
get underneath it, so...

7
00:01:45,602 --> 00:01:47,797
just hang in there.

8
00:01:47,838 --> 00:01:48,998
Excuse me, miss?

9
00:01:52,609 --> 00:01:54,236
Can I have
a different seat, please?

10
00:01:54,878 --> 00:01:57,210
Oh, I'm afraid
we're full tonight, sir.

11
00:01:57,247 --> 00:01:58,805
You're gonna have to stay put.

12
00:01:59,649 --> 00:02:00,980
Thanks anyway.

13
00:02:27,711 --> 00:02:29,235
He's going to make you
help him...

14
00:02:30,414 --> 00:02:31,904
because you're the last.

15
00:02:42,559 --> 00:02:43,787
Listen...

16
00:02:43,827 --> 00:02:46,489
I really need
to change this seat.

17
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:48,828
I'm sorry.
There's nothing I can do.

18
00:02:51,201 --> 00:02:52,498
I'm afraid of heights.

19
00:02:53,303 --> 00:02:54,770
Don't be a pussy.

20
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:06,947
It's not fair! I was almost out!

21
00:03:54,664 --> 00:03:56,063
Shit!

22
00:04:25,529 --> 00:04:27,554
I'll get you, my pretty...

23
00:04:27,597 --> 00:04:29,895
and your little soul, too!

24
00:06:58,415 --> 00:06:59,973
One ticket.

25
00:07:01,718 --> 00:07:03,310
Round trip.

26
00:07:05,488 --> 00:07:06,614
Hurry up, boy.

27
00:07:06,656 --> 00:07:09,489
You don't wanna miss the bus.

28
00:07:34,684 --> 00:07:37,482
No screaming
while the bus is in motion.

29
00:08:12,188 --> 00:08:15,180
Now be a good little doggy...

30
00:08:15,859 --> 00:08:17,053
and go fetch!

31
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:40,298
Spencer, I wanna make sure
you understand our situation.

32
00:09:40,343 --> 00:09:43,176
In one week,
you walk out of here...

33
00:09:43,213 --> 00:09:46,705
and I expect some changes in
your behavior when you get home.

34
00:09:48,084 --> 00:09:49,346
I know you're hearing me.

35
00:09:49,385 --> 00:09:51,444
I put you in here
because you gave me no choice.

36
00:09:51,488 --> 00:09:54,116
Next time, I'll leave you here.

37
00:09:54,157 --> 00:09:55,317
Thanks for the visit, Dad.

38
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,530
Nice job on my kid.

39
00:10:01,564 --> 00:10:03,327
I expected to see
some improvement.

40
00:10:03,366 --> 00:10:04,833
He isn't a Toyota.

41
00:10:05,401 --> 00:10:06,561
What a jerk.

42
00:10:12,742 --> 00:10:14,073
You OK?

43
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:16,874
Yeah. Dad just came by
to lay down some ground rules...

44
00:10:16,913 --> 00:10:18,039
for when I come home...

45
00:10:18,081 --> 00:10:21,073
no more running away, no more
setting his cars on fire.

46
00:10:21,117 --> 00:10:22,243
There are other ways
to get his attention...

47
00:10:22,285 --> 00:10:23,752
besides blowing up the garage.

48
00:10:23,786 --> 00:10:25,253
Yeah. He barely even blinked.

49
00:10:26,756 --> 00:10:29,418
All he wants me to do now
is grow up to be him...

50
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:31,393
an exact copy.

51
00:10:31,427 --> 00:10:34,157
I don't feel like playing
football and date-raping coeds.

52
00:10:34,197 --> 00:10:36,631
One of these days, you're going
to have to face your father.

53
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:37,826
Maggie...

54
00:10:39,502 --> 00:10:41,527
look what I found
in Spencer's room.

55
00:10:41,571 --> 00:10:43,232
A pipe bomb, huh?

56
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:47,432
That? Just showing the kids
survival techniques.

57
00:10:52,782 --> 00:10:55,080
Been confiscating stuff
like this all week.

58
00:10:55,118 --> 00:10:56,585
Where do they get it?

59
00:10:56,619 --> 00:10:59,019
I'll put this downstairs
with the rest of the arsenal.

60
00:10:59,055 --> 00:11:01,114
Weren't the police supposed
to dispose of that stuff?

61
00:11:01,157 --> 00:11:03,921
The police are supposed
to do a lot of things.

62
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,155
- Get your hands off of me!
- Tracy!

63
00:11:06,195 --> 00:11:08,425
- What's the problem?
- She was beating on another kid.

64
00:11:08,464 --> 00:11:09,692
He was hitting on me!

65
00:11:09,732 --> 00:11:11,700
She doesn't like
to be touched.

66
00:11:12,569 --> 00:11:14,730
We have a session today, yes?

67
00:11:14,771 --> 00:11:16,261
I have Doc's class.

68
00:11:16,306 --> 00:11:17,466
Work around him.

69
00:11:18,741 --> 00:11:20,140
I'm sorry, sir.

70
00:11:25,248 --> 00:11:26,977
You seen this junkie before?

71
00:11:27,717 --> 00:11:29,150
No. He's new.

72
00:11:29,185 --> 00:11:33,121
Beautiful. Another afternoon
shot doing juvie paperwork.

73
00:11:33,156 --> 00:11:34,384
Screw that shit.

74
00:11:34,424 --> 00:11:36,619
Let's just scoop him up
and take him to the shelter.

75
00:11:37,393 --> 00:11:39,884
Let the bleeding hearts
do the typing.

76
00:11:41,598 --> 00:11:43,896
That's it. Come on, Tracy.
That's it.

77
00:11:43,933 --> 00:11:46,424
Oh, yeah. She's bad.
The crowd loves her!

78
00:11:46,469 --> 00:11:47,595
She's getting ready...

79
00:11:47,637 --> 00:11:50,902
for the heavyweight champion
boxing match of the world.

80
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,407
Hey, hey, hey. Look at her go.

81
00:11:52,442 --> 00:11:54,034
You know, you are sexy
when you sweat.

82
00:11:55,878 --> 00:11:58,574
You ain't gettin' none, Carlos!

83
00:11:58,615 --> 00:12:00,776
You wouldn't hit a guy
with a handicap, would you?

84
00:12:00,817 --> 00:12:03,217
Oh, you call it a handicap?

85
00:12:03,252 --> 00:12:04,981
I call it chicken, man!
Come on, let's spar.

86
00:12:05,021 --> 00:12:07,421
- No, no. Forget it, Trace.
- Come on...

87
00:12:13,096 --> 00:12:15,087
Don't tune out. Why don't you
talk back to her for once?

88
00:12:15,131 --> 00:12:17,361
Oh, yeah, right. Like you
talk back to your father?

89
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,164
Let me tell you something.
I stopped talking back...

90
00:12:20,203 --> 00:12:22,262
when it became hazardous
to my health, you know?

91
00:12:24,073 --> 00:12:25,233
So, are we set?

92
00:12:25,274 --> 00:12:28,038
Yeah. No problem.
I gave the van driver our cash.

93
00:12:28,077 --> 00:12:30,011
As long as we do it before dawn,
we're home free.

94
00:12:30,046 --> 00:12:33,675
We're gonna be livin' large
in Cali before the week is out.

95
00:12:34,584 --> 00:12:36,211
You better be sure, man.

96
00:12:36,252 --> 00:12:37,879
Trust me, all right?
I got it all covered.

97
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,979
I need to get outta here
even more than you do.

98
00:12:40,023 --> 00:12:42,253
You don't know shit
about needing to get out!

99
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:43,883
Your family's a picnic,
rich boy!

100
00:12:43,926 --> 00:12:46,588
What? You think I hang around
you morons by choice?

101
00:12:46,629 --> 00:12:48,221
Least your father
didn't try to set you up...

102
00:12:48,264 --> 00:12:50,095
with his girlfriend's
older sister.

103
00:12:50,133 --> 00:12:51,896
Don't talk to me about fathers.

104
00:12:51,934 --> 00:12:53,333
Yours come to visit, too?

105
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:56,497
Yeah...
every time I close my eyes.

106
00:13:09,719 --> 00:13:12,313
That did it. Yep. OK.

107
00:13:12,355 --> 00:13:13,845
They caught
one of your star pupils...

108
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:15,790
beating up
on one of our kids again.

109
00:13:16,726 --> 00:13:18,421
Thought you said
you were making progress.

110
00:13:19,462 --> 00:13:21,692
I only get twenty-three minutes
a week with these kids.

111
00:13:21,731 --> 00:13:23,198
With that kind of attention...

112
00:13:23,232 --> 00:13:24,699
you're lucky
she didn't kill him.

113
00:13:26,135 --> 00:13:28,103
That's a good attitude
for a therapist.

114
00:13:28,137 --> 00:13:31,800
Tracy's got some deep trauma
buried inside of her head.

115
00:13:31,841 --> 00:13:34,401
Conventional therapy
is not going to work.

116
00:13:34,444 --> 00:13:36,776
And dream therapy is, huh?

117
00:13:36,813 --> 00:13:38,212
You're such a hippie.

118
00:13:38,848 --> 00:13:41,840
I can reach these kids
through their dreams.

119
00:13:41,884 --> 00:13:43,875
You give me a chance, I can help
you with your little problem.

120
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,888
I don't have a little problem.

121
00:13:45,922 --> 00:13:48,220
I just have
a little reoccurring dream...

122
00:13:48,257 --> 00:13:49,884
and I'm handling it fine.

123
00:13:49,926 --> 00:13:52,326
And you are not being paid
to be a dream doctor.

124
00:13:52,361 --> 00:13:53,851
I'm barely being paid.

125
00:13:53,896 --> 00:13:55,557
That's why I gotta do
what I think is right.

126
00:13:55,598 --> 00:13:56,963
This is new.

127
00:13:56,999 --> 00:13:58,159
You like it?

128
00:13:59,736 --> 00:14:02,899
These are ancient dream demons.

129
00:14:02,939 --> 00:14:05,737
Supposedly they roam
the dreams of the living...

130
00:14:05,775 --> 00:14:09,677
till they find
the most evil, twisted...

131
00:14:09,712 --> 00:14:11,043
human imaginable.

132
00:14:12,882 --> 00:14:15,442
Then they give him
the power to cross the line...

133
00:14:15,485 --> 00:14:17,851
and turn our nightmares
into reality.

134
00:14:18,788 --> 00:14:21,586
Maggie, cops just brought in
another kid. Real mess.

135
00:14:21,624 --> 00:14:24,457
Hasn't sleep for days,
bad case of amnesia.

136
00:14:24,494 --> 00:14:26,223
We need your evaluation
right away.

137
00:14:31,067 --> 00:14:32,557
How long have you been awake?

138
00:14:32,602 --> 00:14:34,263
As far as I can remember?

139
00:14:34,303 --> 00:14:36,567
I don't know. About three days.

140
00:14:38,741 --> 00:14:40,606
Looks more like three weeks.

141
00:14:42,578 --> 00:14:45,342
Yeah, well,
that's the wonder of amnesia...

142
00:14:46,115 --> 00:14:47,810
always keeps you guessing.

143
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:49,181
Where you from?

144
00:14:49,218 --> 00:14:51,015
I don't know!

145
00:14:52,955 --> 00:14:55,947
All I know
is that wherever I'm from...

146
00:14:55,992 --> 00:14:57,289
I was the last.

147
00:14:57,326 --> 00:14:58,520
The last what?

148
00:14:58,561 --> 00:14:59,755
Survivor.

149
00:15:00,997 --> 00:15:04,160
Look, do you have any...

150
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,294
caffeine pills or coffee?
Maybe some coke?

151
00:15:08,671 --> 00:15:10,696
I meant the soda.

152
00:15:13,609 --> 00:15:14,769
Sit down.

153
00:15:26,389 --> 00:15:27,583
Why do you want to stay awake?

154
00:15:27,623 --> 00:15:29,386
Because if I fall asleep...

155
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,493
I'm not waking up.

156
00:15:32,528 --> 00:15:33,654
Why do you think that?

157
00:15:33,696 --> 00:15:36,358
I don't think it. I feel it.

158
00:15:38,901 --> 00:15:41,369
If I fall asleep...

159
00:15:41,404 --> 00:15:42,837
there's gonna be trouble.

160
00:15:46,709 --> 00:15:48,199
Springwood.

161
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,208
Water tower.

162
00:15:58,921 --> 00:16:02,755
Four thousand five hundred
and sixty-seven

163
00:16:02,792 --> 00:16:05,192
Bottles of beer on the wall

164
00:16:06,329 --> 00:16:09,958
Four thousand five hundred
and sixty-seven

165
00:16:09,999 --> 00:16:11,864
Bottles of beer

166
00:16:13,436 --> 00:16:17,167
If one of those bottles
should happen to fall

167
00:16:17,206 --> 00:16:19,800
What a case of...

168
00:16:19,842 --> 00:16:21,332
Hey, I'll break a bottle
over your head...

169
00:16:21,377 --> 00:16:23,368
if you don't shut the fuck up!

170
00:16:27,016 --> 00:16:30,850
Four thousand five hundred
and sixty-six

171
00:16:30,887 --> 00:16:33,321
Bottles of beer on the wall

172
00:16:37,393 --> 00:16:38,883
I won't tell.

173
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,706
Now you're it.

174
00:16:58,748 --> 00:17:00,147
Remember what you have to do.

175
00:17:00,182 --> 00:17:01,740
You got to tag me.

176
00:17:02,785 --> 00:17:03,945
That's it.

177
00:17:08,357 --> 00:17:10,120
Come to Daddy.

178
00:17:43,426 --> 00:17:44,688
Play with me.

179
00:17:45,428 --> 00:17:47,419
Tell me who I am.

180
00:17:47,463 --> 00:17:49,055
I won't tell.

181
00:18:43,352 --> 00:18:46,344
Free me, you idiot!
I'm your fucking memory!

182
00:18:54,263 --> 00:18:55,753
Oh, shit.

183
00:18:58,134 --> 00:18:59,123
Asshole.

184
00:19:01,771 --> 00:19:03,671
What were you dreaming about?

185
00:19:06,175 --> 00:19:07,802
A room.

186
00:19:07,843 --> 00:19:09,640
A house.

187
00:19:09,678 --> 00:19:11,236
A little girl.

188
00:19:12,448 --> 00:19:15,440
Something about the town
from my article.

189
00:19:16,852 --> 00:19:18,581
I remember a water tower.

190
00:19:22,491 --> 00:19:24,891
The article... do you remember
where you got it?

191
00:19:26,162 --> 00:19:28,824
The little girl...
what did she look like?

192
00:19:28,864 --> 00:19:30,695
Brown hair with...

193
00:19:30,733 --> 00:19:32,132
red ribbons.

194
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:37,665
I don't like it.

195
00:19:37,706 --> 00:19:40,300
There's some connection between
your dreams and his dreams...

196
00:19:40,342 --> 00:19:42,902
and his dreams mean bad news.

197
00:19:42,945 --> 00:19:45,072
I know you think I'm crazy,
but I can feel it.

198
00:19:45,114 --> 00:19:48,106
Why can't anybody talk about
anything but dreams around here?

199
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:50,584
I'm so sick of hearing
about this bullshit!

200
00:19:50,619 --> 00:19:51,745
You don't believe that.

201
00:19:51,787 --> 00:19:54,255
You think solving this boy's
puzzle can help with your own.

202
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:55,757
I don't have a puzzle.

203
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,957
Yes, you do.

204
00:19:59,995 --> 00:20:01,428
And although you think
you know everything...

205
00:20:01,464 --> 00:20:04,160
you may not be ready to face
what this boy will show you.

206
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,861
I never said I wanted
to go back there.

207
00:20:05,901 --> 00:20:07,869
I've dealt
with amnesiacs before.

208
00:20:07,903 --> 00:20:10,303
Take you to Springwood,
it's gonna trigger something...

209
00:20:10,339 --> 00:20:11,897
some spark to help you remember.

210
00:20:11,941 --> 00:20:15,206
I don't need a spark to remember
that it was a bad place.

211
00:20:15,244 --> 00:20:16,575
You want a spark? You go.

212
00:20:16,612 --> 00:20:18,842
I'll stay here,
sparkless but happy.

213
00:20:18,881 --> 00:20:21,042
I'll be right there with you.
Don't worry.

214
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:23,916
Kelly, we're gonna take
the van for awhile.

215
00:20:54,183 --> 00:20:55,946
I told you not to let me
fall asleep.

216
00:20:55,985 --> 00:20:57,646
Was that too much to ask for?

217
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:03,382
Go back.

218
00:21:03,425 --> 00:21:05,450
Oh, my God! Pull over!

219
00:21:05,494 --> 00:21:06,654
John, wake up!

220
00:21:11,767 --> 00:21:13,792
Shit. Great.

221
00:21:15,905 --> 00:21:17,372
Funny meeting you here.

222
00:21:17,406 --> 00:21:19,101
Nice driving.

223
00:21:20,109 --> 00:21:22,168
What the hell are you guys
doing here?

224
00:21:23,012 --> 00:21:24,206
Great plan, asshole.

225
00:21:24,246 --> 00:21:26,806
- It almost worked, all right?
- I can't believe you people.

226
00:21:26,849 --> 00:21:30,012
Pulling a stunt like that.

227
00:21:30,052 --> 00:21:32,213
Oh, my God.

228
00:21:32,254 --> 00:21:35,052
Look, the first thing we have
to do is find a telephone...

229
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:36,887
and you call Kelly
and tell him where you are.

230
00:21:36,926 --> 00:21:38,223
You understand?

231
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:40,751
And then we have to figure out
how to get you home.

232
00:21:40,796 --> 00:21:42,423
Are you listening?

233
00:21:42,464 --> 00:21:43,692
Don't scream at me!

234
00:21:43,732 --> 00:21:45,427
It was your driving
that almost killed us.

235
00:22:14,897 --> 00:22:17,161
Two for a dollar, right here!

236
00:22:17,199 --> 00:22:18,393
Get 'em, two!

237
00:22:19,401 --> 00:22:20,595
Two for a dollar!

238
00:22:21,904 --> 00:22:25,067
First I want you to find
a phone, call Kelly...

239
00:22:25,107 --> 00:22:26,369
and tell him you're all right.

240
00:22:26,408 --> 00:22:27,875
Then I want you
to get in that van...

241
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:29,707
and drive straight back
to the shelter.

242
00:22:29,745 --> 00:22:31,076
Think you can handle that...

243
00:22:31,113 --> 00:22:32,580
or do I have to call
the police?

244
00:22:36,719 --> 00:22:38,346
Get away from here. You go away!

245
00:22:38,387 --> 00:22:40,412
"Or do I have to call
the police?"

246
00:22:41,223 --> 00:22:42,451
She ain't my mother.

247
00:22:44,226 --> 00:22:46,421
We want some peach cobbler
here and...

248
00:23:00,876 --> 00:23:02,639
- There are no kids.
- What?

249
00:23:04,013 --> 00:23:05,071
Town fair...

250
00:23:05,114 --> 00:23:06,775
and there are no kids.

251
00:23:18,027 --> 00:23:20,222
- So what's up, Spence?
- This phone's out of order.

252
00:23:20,262 --> 00:23:21,524
So is this town.

253
00:23:21,563 --> 00:23:22,587
You are not kidding.

254
00:23:22,631 --> 00:23:27,091
Oh, what beautiful,
adorable children!

255
00:23:27,136 --> 00:23:28,865
Would you like to come
and live with us?

256
00:23:28,904 --> 00:23:32,203
It's been so long since
we've had children in the house.

257
00:23:32,241 --> 00:23:34,175
So long.

258
00:23:34,209 --> 00:23:36,370
This time,
I swear it'll be different.

259
00:23:36,412 --> 00:23:38,107
This time, I'll be careful...

260
00:23:38,147 --> 00:23:40,877
and I'll hide you better,
so that he'll never find you.

261
00:23:40,916 --> 00:23:43,384
Looky, I got your nose! Looky!

262
00:23:43,419 --> 00:23:44,579
Ethel!

263
00:23:46,588 --> 00:23:49,386
I want my children back!

264
00:23:49,425 --> 00:23:50,915
You know they bring him!

265
00:23:59,435 --> 00:24:01,232
Now see what you done did?!

266
00:24:02,371 --> 00:24:03,998
Jesus.

267
00:24:04,039 --> 00:24:06,337
- We're in Twin Peaks here.
- Definitely.

268
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:07,501
Have we seen enough?

269
00:24:07,543 --> 00:24:08,874
- Yeah.
- Good.

270
00:24:12,047 --> 00:24:14,106
Come on, back in the van.

271
00:24:14,149 --> 00:24:15,844
That's a very good idea.

272
00:24:15,884 --> 00:24:17,249
Now. Go!

273
00:24:17,286 --> 00:24:18,446
Jeez.

274
00:24:25,327 --> 00:24:26,555
I hope they make it.

275
00:24:26,595 --> 00:24:28,324
Let's see what they can tell us
at the school.

276
00:24:29,231 --> 00:24:31,825
- What?
- Somebody rang those bells.

277
00:24:32,568 --> 00:24:33,728
Lucky us.

278
00:24:51,186 --> 00:24:53,245
Trace, there's a map back here.

279
00:24:53,288 --> 00:24:54,880
Did I say I needed a map?

280
00:24:54,923 --> 00:24:57,414
I can't get over the way
those people looked at us.

281
00:24:57,459 --> 00:24:59,120
Yeah, that was weird.

282
00:25:08,837 --> 00:25:10,099
Shit.

283
00:25:12,207 --> 00:25:13,401
Nice going.

284
00:25:14,143 --> 00:25:16,771
Takes talent to travel
in a complete circle.

285
00:25:16,812 --> 00:25:18,439
And you're making me dizzy.

286
00:25:19,515 --> 00:25:21,278
Jeez.

287
00:25:21,316 --> 00:25:22,647
Do you have to do that?

288
00:25:22,684 --> 00:25:24,845
You're such a high ho,
you know that?

289
00:25:24,887 --> 00:25:27,378
I don't play that shit.
I need all the senses I've got.

290
00:25:27,423 --> 00:25:29,414
Put that fucking thing out.

291
00:25:29,458 --> 00:25:30,584
It's hard enough
staying awake...

292
00:25:30,626 --> 00:25:32,491
without you lighting up
every ten seconds.

293
00:25:32,528 --> 00:25:35,326
- This relaxes me.
- I'll relax you.

294
00:25:35,364 --> 00:25:36,888
I'll just puncture your heart...

295
00:25:36,932 --> 00:25:38,524
mess up these seats.

296
00:25:38,567 --> 00:25:39,795
You need to get laid.

297
00:25:39,835 --> 00:25:41,598
Would you like the map now?

298
00:25:42,538 --> 00:25:44,506
No, I don't need any map.

299
00:25:45,474 --> 00:25:47,135
No, of course not.

300
00:25:57,019 --> 00:25:58,179
- Why'd you stop?
- Look.

301
00:26:28,817 --> 00:26:30,148
Oh, great.

302
00:26:32,621 --> 00:26:33,815
Give me the map.

303
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:37,654
Not a word.

304
00:26:37,693 --> 00:26:40,218
Carlos, I asked you for the map!

305
00:27:07,823 --> 00:27:08,983
What is this?!

306
00:27:17,032 --> 00:27:18,727
I asked you for the map.

307
00:27:18,767 --> 00:27:20,530
What?

308
00:27:22,871 --> 00:27:24,930
Yeah, well,
the map says we're fucked.

309
00:27:26,775 --> 00:27:29,209
Look, you've had two chances.
Now it's my turn.

310
00:27:33,715 --> 00:27:34,841
Dickhead.

311
00:27:34,883 --> 00:27:36,043
Nice.

312
00:27:54,536 --> 00:27:56,936
You'll all be expected
to pass...

313
00:27:56,972 --> 00:28:00,066
both the written
and an oral examination.

314
00:28:01,343 --> 00:28:02,571
Don't disturb him.

315
00:28:03,278 --> 00:28:06,611
You will need to study...

316
00:28:06,648 --> 00:28:07,842
this.

317
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,815
Now the dates.
Got to get the dates right.

318
00:28:13,855 --> 00:28:15,322
Got to keep them in order.

319
00:28:15,357 --> 00:28:17,484
If you get them out of order,
you'll get very confused.

320
00:28:36,945 --> 00:28:38,071
You were here.

321
00:28:38,113 --> 00:28:39,273
What?

322
00:28:42,718 --> 00:28:43,878
Welcome...

323
00:28:45,721 --> 00:28:47,279
to Freddy 101.

324
00:28:48,991 --> 00:28:50,856
1493...

325
00:28:50,892 --> 00:28:53,417
Freddy sailed across the sea.

326
00:28:59,801 --> 00:29:01,735
These dates, they're all
within a ten-year period.

327
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:03,795
What the hell happened here?

328
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:05,534
Freddy happened here.

329
00:29:06,808 --> 00:29:08,776
Here was the crucial point.

330
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:10,243
Anybody know
what I'm getting at?

331
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:12,307
Anybody? Hmm?

332
00:29:12,347 --> 00:29:14,747
Come on, people!

333
00:29:14,783 --> 00:29:15,613
We covered this!

334
00:29:16,451 --> 00:29:19,545
This is where
they took away his child.

335
00:29:19,588 --> 00:29:20,885
What child?

336
00:29:20,922 --> 00:29:22,048
Taken away...

337
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:23,887
put in the town orphanage.

338
00:29:23,925 --> 00:29:25,187
Freddy had a kid.

339
00:29:30,365 --> 00:29:33,857
1494...

340
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:36,633
Freddy came back...

341
00:29:36,672 --> 00:29:38,162
to look...

342
00:29:38,206 --> 00:29:39,537
for more.

343
00:29:47,215 --> 00:29:48,477
There's no way out.

344
00:29:48,517 --> 00:29:49,848
Not with you driving.

345
00:29:49,885 --> 00:29:51,785
Yeah, well,
you didn't do much better.

346
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:54,050
No, but at least I did it
in half the time.

347
00:29:56,892 --> 00:29:58,519
Come on. Where are you going?

348
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,323
Away.

349
00:30:00,362 --> 00:30:01,852
Look, we're just too fried
to see straight.

350
00:30:01,897 --> 00:30:03,023
Let's just find Maggie.

351
00:30:03,065 --> 00:30:06,831
I'm not turning myself over
for any adult supervision.

352
00:30:06,868 --> 00:30:08,460
This girl's getting some rest.

353
00:30:09,471 --> 00:30:12,372
In fact, I think I see my kinda
neighborhood up ahead...

354
00:30:12,407 --> 00:30:13,533
empty.

355
00:30:13,575 --> 00:30:15,042
You know, she's losing it.

356
00:30:15,077 --> 00:30:16,874
Sad thing is,
I'm starting to like her.

357
00:30:16,912 --> 00:30:18,140
That is sad.

358
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,577
Come on, Trace. Wait up!

359
00:30:37,933 --> 00:30:39,400
This is the one.

360
00:30:39,434 --> 00:30:41,265
We'll have it all to ourselves.

361
00:30:42,037 --> 00:30:44,562
- Bet there's no heat.
- No plumbing, right?

362
00:30:44,606 --> 00:30:45,937
You'll survive.

363
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:49,441
Come on.

364
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,046
Where you going?

365
00:31:33,088 --> 00:31:36,216
Gonna go upstairs
and find a bed. Man, I'm tired.

366
00:31:36,258 --> 00:31:37,987
I gotta find a bathroom.

367
00:31:39,194 --> 00:31:42,095
This place makes the shelter
look like the Ritz.

368
00:32:03,451 --> 00:32:04,645
Great.

369
00:32:05,587 --> 00:32:06,747
Well...

370
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:12,453
at least it beats the streets,
right, Carlos?

371
00:32:13,895 --> 00:32:15,556
Ohh, this is good.

372
00:32:16,798 --> 00:32:18,265
I'm gonna get some sleep...

373
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,996
and I will get us out of here
in the morning.

374
00:32:32,614 --> 00:32:35,378
Why do you think that kid
said not to fall asleep?

375
00:32:35,417 --> 00:32:37,044
'Cause he's a lame-o freak.

376
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:40,349
Miss Maggie's pet psycho.

377
00:33:07,782 --> 00:33:09,113
Where the hell are you?

378
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:11,516
Why aren't you listening
to me, Carlos?

379
00:33:28,904 --> 00:33:30,531
Tracy, where are you?

380
00:33:30,572 --> 00:33:32,130
Behind you.

381
00:33:36,311 --> 00:33:37,471
Mama?

382
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:44,643
Maybe you don't hear so good.

383
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:49,183
Maybe I clean out your ears
for you.

384
00:33:49,224 --> 00:33:51,385
No, no. Mama, please,
I've been a good boy.

385
00:33:51,426 --> 00:33:52,688
You don't understand.

386
00:33:52,727 --> 00:33:54,558
I've been good, Mama!

387
00:33:54,596 --> 00:33:57,656
Don't make me deaf, Mama!
Please! I'm sorry!

388
00:33:57,699 --> 00:33:58,859
I'm not.

389
00:34:14,215 --> 00:34:17,309
Oh, Carlos, lend me your ear.

390
00:35:44,839 --> 00:35:50,402
Give me my hearing back!

391
00:36:17,539 --> 00:36:19,006
Where is it?

392
00:37:11,926 --> 00:37:14,121
Y-you wouldn't do that,
would you, man?

393
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:16,256
No, no, no! Please!

394
00:37:16,297 --> 00:37:17,457
No, man!

395
00:38:36,044 --> 00:38:38,569
Nice hearing from you, Carlos.

396
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,358
I can't find Carlos.

397
00:39:01,436 --> 00:39:02,869
See what's on this TV?

398
00:39:04,973 --> 00:39:07,441
I'm gonna take the van.
I'm gonna look for him.

399
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:16,578
Give me some room!

400
00:39:19,454 --> 00:39:20,887
Don't fall asleep, man!

401
00:39:20,922 --> 00:39:22,048
Get out!

402
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:24,024
Spencer, get out, man!

403
00:39:24,058 --> 00:39:25,753
Carlos, man...

404
00:39:26,527 --> 00:39:28,518
we were just looking for you.

405
00:39:30,698 --> 00:39:32,495
Don't fall asleep, man!

406
00:39:32,533 --> 00:39:34,763
Spencer, you stupid stoner!

407
00:39:43,945 --> 00:39:45,708
We shouldn't even be here.

408
00:39:48,549 --> 00:39:49,948
We're supposed to be
finding out about you...

409
00:39:49,984 --> 00:39:52,384
not some dead killer's kid.

410
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:55,150
We might be talking
about the same thing.

411
00:39:55,189 --> 00:39:57,851
The whole town's obsessing
on this Krueger character.

412
00:39:57,892 --> 00:39:59,382
Don't you start.

413
00:40:00,895 --> 00:40:03,796
But why else
would they be afraid of me?

414
00:40:03,831 --> 00:40:06,629
Why else am I still alive
when everybody else is dead?

415
00:40:06,668 --> 00:40:09,364
Skip, skip, skip to my loo

416
00:40:09,404 --> 00:40:11,929
Skip to my loo, my darling

417
00:40:21,249 --> 00:40:23,217
Martha, no running.

418
00:40:23,251 --> 00:40:24,616
Everyone hold hands.

419
00:40:26,921 --> 00:40:29,082
Oh, you've come back.

420
00:40:29,123 --> 00:40:30,522
How nice.

421
00:40:31,526 --> 00:40:32,754
Do you remember me?

422
00:40:32,794 --> 00:40:34,421
Well, of course I do, my boy.

423
00:40:34,462 --> 00:40:37,329
I remember
every one of my children.

424
00:40:37,365 --> 00:40:38,627
Especially you.

425
00:40:39,434 --> 00:40:41,265
What a pretty little girl
you were.

426
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:43,899
And I remember you...

427
00:40:43,938 --> 00:40:45,929
and you.

428
00:40:45,973 --> 00:40:47,304
Do you remember
the Krueger child?

429
00:40:47,342 --> 00:40:48,809
Of course.

430
00:40:48,843 --> 00:40:50,708
Who was it?

431
00:40:50,745 --> 00:40:53,236
We're not permitted to disclose
a child's real identity.

432
00:40:53,281 --> 00:40:55,272
Oh, Melissa. Melissa.

433
00:40:55,316 --> 00:40:57,443
You must let Bobby
have the ball.

434
00:40:58,486 --> 00:41:00,454
Come here. That's all right.

435
00:41:00,488 --> 00:41:01,819
We share.

436
00:41:01,856 --> 00:41:04,825
I wonder who has a little
bare footie around here?

437
00:41:04,859 --> 00:41:06,224
"K. Krueger."

438
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:08,353
Could mean anything
from Kevin to Kyle.

439
00:41:08,396 --> 00:41:10,864
All it really means is there was
a child here by that name.

440
00:41:11,966 --> 00:41:14,696
No. It's me.

441
00:41:17,905 --> 00:41:19,702
I'm his kid.

442
00:41:19,741 --> 00:41:21,675
That's why he's kept me alive.

443
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:24,878
He's trying to play
some sick game with me.

444
00:41:24,912 --> 00:41:27,380
He is dead, all right?

445
00:41:27,415 --> 00:41:29,178
He's dead,
and you're not his kid.

446
00:41:30,218 --> 00:41:31,879
How do you know?

447
00:41:31,919 --> 00:41:33,546
She remembered me.

448
00:41:33,588 --> 00:41:35,055
She remembered me, too...

449
00:41:35,089 --> 00:41:37,387
and fifty other
imaginary friends.

450
00:41:37,425 --> 00:41:38,892
Let's get out of here.

451
00:41:38,926 --> 00:41:40,894
Let's draw a picture.

452
00:41:40,928 --> 00:41:43,396
We can draw pictures all day.

453
00:41:43,431 --> 00:41:44,557
There you go.

454
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:47,193
Clippety-clop, clippety-clop.
Isn't that fun?

455
00:41:53,741 --> 00:41:55,470
I can't believe I found you.

456
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:56,977
What are you still doing here?

457
00:41:57,011 --> 00:41:58,842
I can't find Carlos...

458
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,677
and Spencer's wasted
at this old house.

459
00:42:00,715 --> 00:42:03,309
We gotta get to them
before Freddy does.

460
00:42:03,351 --> 00:42:04,784
- Who's Freddy?
- I'll tell you on the way.

461
00:42:04,819 --> 00:42:05,911
Come on!

462
00:42:07,822 --> 00:42:08,982
God damn it!

463
00:42:19,567 --> 00:42:21,728
All right. Once again.

464
00:42:22,737 --> 00:42:24,170
This is your brain.

465
00:42:26,707 --> 00:42:29,267
This is your brain...

466
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:31,301
on drugs.

467
00:42:33,581 --> 00:42:34,741
Questions?

468
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:39,014
Yeah! What are you on?

469
00:42:39,053 --> 00:42:42,318
Looks like a frying pan
and some eggs to me.

470
00:42:44,759 --> 00:42:46,351
Hey, Spence.

471
00:42:46,394 --> 00:42:48,259
Let's trip out.

472
00:42:56,737 --> 00:42:57,897
Cool.

473
00:43:35,109 --> 00:43:36,508
Now he's gone!

474
00:43:37,345 --> 00:43:39,040
He must've fallen asleep.

475
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:41,048
You two look here and upstairs.
I'm gonna look downstairs.

476
00:43:41,082 --> 00:43:42,549
They're not here anymore.

477
00:43:42,583 --> 00:43:45,575
Just humor me,
will you, please, and look?

478
00:43:49,457 --> 00:43:50,947
Where am I?

479
00:43:52,593 --> 00:43:54,151
Jump, boy.

480
00:44:02,069 --> 00:44:03,764
- Dad?
- Be like me.

481
00:44:05,907 --> 00:44:08,467
Father knows best.

482
00:44:08,509 --> 00:44:10,101
Oh! Oh, stop!

483
00:44:15,383 --> 00:44:17,078
I'm not like you!

484
00:44:17,118 --> 00:44:18,676
I don't wanna be like you!

485
00:44:20,755 --> 00:44:23,849
Be like me.

486
00:44:23,891 --> 00:44:26,553
Now I'm playin' with power!

487
00:44:30,398 --> 00:44:31,626
All right.

488
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:34,891
Super Spencer!

489
00:44:40,741 --> 00:44:42,766
Great graphics.

490
00:44:55,923 --> 00:44:57,720
Whoa. I'm here.

491
00:45:09,537 --> 00:45:11,402
I found Spencer!

492
00:45:16,877 --> 00:45:18,674
OK, hold him down.

493
00:45:20,047 --> 00:45:21,514
Oh, shit.

494
00:45:23,050 --> 00:45:24,711
Hold on. Hold on to him.

495
00:45:24,752 --> 00:45:27,516
- What's happening to him?
- He's stuck in a nightmare.

496
00:45:27,555 --> 00:45:28,749
And it's kicking
the shit out of him!

497
00:45:29,657 --> 00:45:31,682
- Wake him up.
- He's too wasted.

498
00:45:31,726 --> 00:45:34,251
- Spencer! Jesus.
- It's Freddy.

499
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:37,763
We've got to get him out.

500
00:45:37,798 --> 00:45:39,356
I'll go into his dream.

501
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,891
I'll try and bring him out
before he gets killed.

502
00:45:41,936 --> 00:45:43,096
That's crazy.

503
00:45:45,906 --> 00:45:47,635
What do you call that, rational?

504
00:46:06,594 --> 00:46:08,926
Right... left.
Right, left, right, left. Pow!

505
00:46:23,911 --> 00:46:24,809
He's getting trashed.

506
00:46:24,845 --> 00:46:25,971
I have to go in.

507
00:46:26,013 --> 00:46:27,275
What about Freddy?

508
00:46:28,115 --> 00:46:29,241
Freddy won't hurt me.

509
00:46:29,283 --> 00:46:30,841
I'm family.

510
00:46:30,885 --> 00:46:32,614
OK, so how are you gonna go in?

511
00:46:32,653 --> 00:46:34,314
Well...

512
00:46:35,589 --> 00:46:36,920
you're gonna have to lay me out.

513
00:46:37,892 --> 00:46:39,018
What? What is it...

514
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:40,789
- Just fucking lay me out!
- Wait a second!

515
00:46:40,828 --> 00:46:44,559
- Doc told me a different way.
- No time to talk! Just do it!

516
00:46:52,907 --> 00:46:55,774
Jesus Christ.

517
00:47:02,516 --> 00:47:04,882
I told you I knew an easier way.

518
00:47:04,919 --> 00:47:08,116
Concentration meditation.
That's what Doc always says.

519
00:47:09,523 --> 00:47:11,184
This place is incredible.

520
00:47:13,928 --> 00:47:15,828
Pow! Bam! Splat!

521
00:47:15,863 --> 00:47:17,023
Is that him?

522
00:47:18,866 --> 00:47:20,060
Jump, boy.

523
00:47:21,368 --> 00:47:23,199
Ow! Stop!

524
00:47:23,237 --> 00:47:25,205
Oh, shit! Spencer!

525
00:47:29,877 --> 00:47:31,845
Come on, John! Let go of me!

526
00:47:33,581 --> 00:47:34,843
Get out of here! Now, Tracy!

527
00:47:34,882 --> 00:47:38,181
Hey, You forgot the power glove.

528
00:47:40,755 --> 00:47:42,086
Pow!

529
00:47:43,124 --> 00:47:44,682
Boing, boing.

530
00:47:57,872 --> 00:47:59,737
Be like me. Be like me.

531
00:48:15,990 --> 00:48:17,218
What do you know?

532
00:48:17,258 --> 00:48:19,488
I beat my high score.

533
00:48:41,415 --> 00:48:44,350
Great to be back in business...

534
00:48:44,385 --> 00:48:46,216
thanks to you.

535
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:56,661
Daddy's waiting for you,
little girl.

536
00:48:56,697 --> 00:48:58,062
Shut the fuck up, man!

537
00:49:10,945 --> 00:49:13,140
Spencer's gone.
I couldn't stop it.

538
00:49:13,948 --> 00:49:15,415
John's still in there.

539
00:49:15,449 --> 00:49:16,746
I couldn't wake him up.

540
00:49:16,784 --> 00:49:19,309
Come on! Snap out of it!
What are we gonna do?

541
00:49:19,353 --> 00:49:21,844
We're gonna pick him up
and get the hell out of here!

542
00:50:27,588 --> 00:50:29,215
Not again.

543
00:50:29,256 --> 00:50:31,190
He's not gonna get me again.

544
00:50:32,326 --> 00:50:34,590
Nothing is gonna
make me get off this bed.

545
00:50:37,765 --> 00:50:39,426
Damn it!

546
00:50:44,371 --> 00:50:45,599
I hate this house.

547
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:34,387
Up here!

548
00:51:50,504 --> 00:51:51,937
I know why you let me go.

549
00:51:54,108 --> 00:51:57,703
Do you think I'm your daddy?

550
00:52:00,781 --> 00:52:03,147
Wrong!

551
00:52:07,621 --> 00:52:09,589
But you let me live.

552
00:52:09,623 --> 00:52:13,719
Only long enough for you
to bring me back my daughter.

553
00:52:13,761 --> 00:52:14,921
Your daughter?

554
00:52:18,132 --> 00:52:19,394
And now...

555
00:52:19,433 --> 00:52:24,496
she's gonna take me
to a whole new playground.

556
00:52:29,877 --> 00:52:33,278
Grounded!

557
00:52:54,635 --> 00:52:56,728
Oh, my God, Maggie!
What's going on?

558
00:52:57,771 --> 00:52:59,796
Come on, Maggie. Let's go!

559
00:53:01,408 --> 00:53:02,739
Come...

560
00:53:02,776 --> 00:53:04,573
Let's get out of here!

561
00:53:04,611 --> 00:53:06,078
Let's get the hell out of here!

562
00:53:06,113 --> 00:53:08,673
It... it's not a boy.

563
00:53:10,384 --> 00:53:11,874
It's...

564
00:53:14,221 --> 00:53:15,711
Come on!
We gotta get out of here!

565
00:53:15,756 --> 00:53:17,917
Now! Come on!

566
00:53:21,061 --> 00:53:22,221
Let's go!

567
00:53:32,239 --> 00:53:35,174
You forgot
where you came from, kid...

568
00:53:36,176 --> 00:53:39,543
but I know where you're going.

569
00:53:45,652 --> 00:53:47,586
It's traveling time!

570
00:54:00,367 --> 00:54:02,528
What's wrong?
Maggie, get in the van!

571
00:54:02,569 --> 00:54:03,729
Come on!

572
00:54:05,572 --> 00:54:07,836
We gotta get the hell
out of here!

573
00:54:07,875 --> 00:54:09,172
Oh, God.

574
00:54:09,209 --> 00:54:10,540
Let's go!

575
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:34,367
Whatever happened...

576
00:54:34,401 --> 00:54:36,301
it wasn't your fault.

577
00:54:48,916 --> 00:54:50,406
Carlos, Tracy, and Spencer...

578
00:54:50,450 --> 00:54:52,884
stowed away in the back
of the shelter van.

579
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:55,388
They were trying to escape.
Can you believe it?

580
00:54:55,422 --> 00:54:58,391
So I took them to the phone.
They were supposed to call you.

581
00:54:58,425 --> 00:55:00,393
John Doe and I were gonna
check out the school.

582
00:55:00,427 --> 00:55:02,292
But Tracy got separated.

583
00:55:02,329 --> 00:55:03,762
And then they ran away.

584
00:55:05,032 --> 00:55:06,329
What the hell
are you talking about?

585
00:55:06,366 --> 00:55:09,335
I'm talking about Carlos
and Spencer and the John Doe!

586
00:55:09,369 --> 00:55:11,360
Kelly, they just disappeared!

587
00:55:11,405 --> 00:55:12,997
Been handling
too many cases, Maggie.

588
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:14,507
Those kids were never here.

589
00:55:16,043 --> 00:55:18,011
I would've remembered
any new arrivals.

590
00:55:18,045 --> 00:55:20,138
Kelly, I'm talking about
forty-eight hours ago.

591
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:21,306
I brought you a John Doe.

592
00:55:21,348 --> 00:55:22,610
Don't tell me
you don't remember that!

593
00:55:22,649 --> 00:55:24,412
You the one who's handling
too many cases!

594
00:55:24,451 --> 00:55:25,611
Get some rest, Maggie.

595
00:55:29,423 --> 00:55:30,720
And then...

596
00:55:31,725 --> 00:55:33,693
we got back and...

597
00:55:33,727 --> 00:55:36,457
no one remembers John or Carlos.

598
00:55:37,397 --> 00:55:40,560
It's like they never existed.

599
00:55:40,601 --> 00:55:42,364
I've been hearing strange shit.

600
00:55:42,402 --> 00:55:45,894
Like some of the kids
are dreaming about Carlos.

601
00:55:46,907 --> 00:55:48,340
And they don't even
remember him.

602
00:55:52,479 --> 00:55:54,208
I remember him.

603
00:55:54,248 --> 00:55:55,875
Why?

604
00:55:55,916 --> 00:55:57,884
Because I can control my dreams.

605
00:55:57,918 --> 00:56:00,819
I'm not fooled
by this thing you saw.

606
00:56:01,688 --> 00:56:02,814
Whatever he is...

607
00:56:02,856 --> 00:56:05,950
he's fucking with the line
between dreams and reality.

608
00:56:05,993 --> 00:56:08,587
He didn't just kill Carlos
and the others.

609
00:56:09,763 --> 00:56:10,923
He erased them.

610
00:56:25,245 --> 00:56:26,405
It's not a boy.

611
00:56:55,175 --> 00:56:56,335
Mother!

612
00:57:20,467 --> 00:57:21,627
Shit.

613
00:57:26,273 --> 00:57:27,797
You're getting ready
to kill somebody.

614
00:57:27,841 --> 00:57:29,468
Defend myself.

615
00:57:32,379 --> 00:57:34,074
It's your mind he'll go for.

616
00:57:36,616 --> 00:57:37,776
Your fear.

617
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:41,984
I knew it, I knew it, I knew it.

618
00:57:45,826 --> 00:57:48,386
Maggie, what are you doing?

619
00:57:49,896 --> 00:57:51,090
Who are they?

620
00:57:51,898 --> 00:57:53,456
Let me have that.

621
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:55,866
- I have to know.
- I don't know.

622
00:57:55,902 --> 00:57:58,132
I don't know who they were.
They wouldn't tell me.

623
00:57:58,905 --> 00:58:01,396
They have rules
about no contact.

624
00:58:03,076 --> 00:58:05,169
Oh, there's been contact.

625
00:59:05,172 --> 00:59:06,639
Find me.

626
00:59:06,673 --> 00:59:07,833
Find Daddy.

627
00:59:08,942 --> 00:59:10,000
You're it.

628
00:59:12,212 --> 00:59:13,770
Come to Daddy.

629
00:59:15,849 --> 00:59:18,181
I won't tell.

630
00:59:18,218 --> 00:59:19,378
Oh, God.

631
00:59:28,228 --> 00:59:29,991
Fred, please...

632
00:59:30,030 --> 00:59:31,520
I won't tell.

633
00:59:34,534 --> 00:59:36,593
We need to talk, Loretta.

634
00:59:41,541 --> 00:59:43,099
Go inside, honey.

635
00:59:44,678 --> 00:59:46,669
I won't tell.

636
00:59:46,713 --> 00:59:48,840
I told you never...

637
00:59:48,882 --> 00:59:51,180
never to go in there.

638
00:59:51,218 --> 00:59:53,118
I told you that! I told you.

639
01:01:04,558 --> 01:01:06,788
Catherine.

640
01:01:11,498 --> 01:01:14,695
You were such a little artist.

641
01:01:14,734 --> 01:01:16,201
No, it can't be.

642
01:01:17,904 --> 01:01:19,462
I know who I am.

643
01:01:26,212 --> 01:01:28,874
You're my blood.

644
01:01:28,915 --> 01:01:31,713
Only you could have
brought me out...

645
01:01:31,751 --> 01:01:33,480
in your mind.

646
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:35,715
But you can't be my father.

647
01:01:35,755 --> 01:01:37,950
They took you away from me...

648
01:01:37,991 --> 01:01:41,324
but I made 'em pay!

649
01:01:41,361 --> 01:01:45,764
I took all their children
away from them...

650
01:01:45,799 --> 01:01:47,027
and now...

651
01:01:48,201 --> 01:01:49,759
that's over.

652
01:01:51,705 --> 01:01:53,070
Come on.

653
01:02:01,381 --> 01:02:02,848
The shelter.

654
01:02:04,050 --> 01:02:08,646
Time to start all over again.

655
01:02:08,688 --> 01:02:10,383
But this isn't Springwood!

656
01:02:17,731 --> 01:02:19,460
Every town...

657
01:02:19,499 --> 01:02:21,660
has an Elm Street.

658
01:02:58,338 --> 01:02:59,965
Tracy girl...

659
01:03:00,940 --> 01:03:02,271
Daddy's home.

660
01:03:03,643 --> 01:03:05,907
Daddy... you're dead.

661
01:03:10,950 --> 01:03:12,474
I'm home, darling.

662
01:03:23,163 --> 01:03:24,494
Come say hello.

663
01:03:26,132 --> 01:03:27,827
I don't want to, Daddy.

664
01:03:38,011 --> 01:03:41,003
Come on, give Daddy some honey.

665
01:03:46,352 --> 01:03:48,183
No one has to know.

666
01:03:56,396 --> 01:03:57,727
You're not my daddy.

667
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:02,365
Come on, Tracy.

668
01:04:09,843 --> 01:04:12,641
Here! Do you love me now?

669
01:04:17,851 --> 01:04:19,182
He's dead!

670
01:04:19,219 --> 01:04:20,982
My daddy's dead.

671
01:04:28,161 --> 01:04:30,356
No honey for Daddy?

672
01:04:37,437 --> 01:04:39,962
What's with kids today, huh?

673
01:04:40,006 --> 01:04:41,906
No respect.

674
01:04:41,941 --> 01:04:44,136
You can't scare me anymore.

675
01:04:44,177 --> 01:04:46,805
Oh, you better speak up.

676
01:04:46,846 --> 01:04:49,440
Must be my deaf ear.

677
01:04:57,657 --> 01:05:00,524
Kung fu this, bitch.

678
01:05:06,633 --> 01:05:09,568
This is my dream,
and I do what I want.

679
01:05:09,602 --> 01:05:11,661
Might be your dream...

680
01:05:11,704 --> 01:05:14,468
but it's my rules!

681
01:05:35,495 --> 01:05:38,328
Doc... I need to talk to Doc!

682
01:05:39,966 --> 01:05:41,092
Come on!

683
01:06:20,940 --> 01:06:23,135
Doc? Doc, is that you?

684
01:06:23,176 --> 01:06:24,803
Yeah, Tracy. Where are you?

685
01:06:24,844 --> 01:06:26,471
I'm over here
in one of the lockers.

686
01:06:26,512 --> 01:06:27,774
You gotta get me out!

687
01:06:33,386 --> 01:06:34,580
Where the hell are you?

688
01:06:34,621 --> 01:06:35,883
Right here.

689
01:06:39,959 --> 01:06:40,823
You taught her a lot...

690
01:06:40,860 --> 01:06:44,990
but there's so much more
to learn.

691
01:06:45,031 --> 01:06:47,363
How about this, Doc?

692
01:07:16,529 --> 01:07:20,761
Sticks and stones
may break my bones...

693
01:07:21,634 --> 01:07:25,331
but nothing will ever kill me.

694
01:07:26,172 --> 01:07:29,437
Well, let's see now.

695
01:07:29,475 --> 01:07:32,535
First they tried burning me.

696
01:07:34,614 --> 01:07:38,710
Then they tried burying me.

697
01:07:44,924 --> 01:07:48,758
But this... this is my favorite.

698
01:07:50,697 --> 01:07:53,996
They even tried holy water.

699
01:07:58,504 --> 01:08:02,770
But I just keep on tickin'...

700
01:08:03,943 --> 01:08:06,878
because they promised me that.

701
01:08:06,913 --> 01:08:08,039
They?

702
01:08:08,081 --> 01:08:09,981
The dream people.

703
01:08:10,016 --> 01:08:12,314
The ones that gave me this job.

704
01:08:13,820 --> 01:08:15,310
In dreams...

705
01:08:16,155 --> 01:08:20,854
I am forever!

706
01:08:20,893 --> 01:08:22,622
Too bad you're not.

707
01:08:42,715 --> 01:08:43,875
Thank God.

708
01:08:46,052 --> 01:08:47,576
I think I've got a way
to get him.

709
01:08:49,355 --> 01:08:50,879
So what's the plan, Doc?

710
01:08:53,226 --> 01:08:54,352
Thanks.

711
01:08:54,394 --> 01:08:55,759
You can't get him
in the dream...

712
01:08:56,596 --> 01:08:59,724
but if this can come out,
he can come out.

713
01:08:59,766 --> 01:09:02,394
And if he can come out,
he can bleed.

714
01:09:02,435 --> 01:09:04,164
- And die.
- Right.

715
01:09:04,203 --> 01:09:05,727
How will you know
when I got him?

716
01:09:05,772 --> 01:09:07,467
I'm gonna find you with this...

717
01:09:07,507 --> 01:09:08,974
and then I'm bringing you out.

718
01:09:09,008 --> 01:09:11,272
You've got to be holding him
to carry him out.

719
01:09:11,310 --> 01:09:12,834
I know.

720
01:09:12,879 --> 01:09:14,676
He's gonna try and trick you
just like Tracy.

721
01:09:15,381 --> 01:09:17,508
He'll try to use your eyes
to fool you.

722
01:09:17,550 --> 01:09:19,177
You'll use these.

723
01:09:19,218 --> 01:09:20,515
Get the hell outta here.

724
01:09:20,553 --> 01:09:22,043
You want to live?

725
01:09:22,088 --> 01:09:24,215
These mean nothing here...

726
01:09:24,257 --> 01:09:26,521
but in a dream,
they can be anything you want.

727
01:09:26,559 --> 01:09:29,585
He got inside your head.
You get inside of his.

728
01:09:30,830 --> 01:09:32,092
That's my job, isn't it?

729
01:09:32,131 --> 01:09:35,157
Be careful. He's good at
finding out what hurts the most.

730
01:09:35,201 --> 01:09:36,327
Exactly.

731
01:09:36,369 --> 01:09:39,065
That's why you gotta take me
with you.

732
01:09:39,105 --> 01:09:40,436
I can't.

733
01:09:40,473 --> 01:09:43,636
It's gotta be me and him.

734
01:09:46,379 --> 01:09:47,641
All right, Doc.

735
01:09:48,748 --> 01:09:49,908
Put me in.

736
01:09:54,987 --> 01:09:56,147
Strap her in.

737
01:09:59,492 --> 01:10:00,789
Take a deep breath.

738
01:10:02,295 --> 01:10:03,728
Good.

739
01:10:04,564 --> 01:10:05,724
Ten...

740
01:10:06,566 --> 01:10:07,931
nine...

741
01:10:08,634 --> 01:10:10,101
eight...

742
01:10:10,136 --> 01:10:11,433
seven...

743
01:10:11,471 --> 01:10:13,098
six...

744
01:10:13,139 --> 01:10:14,470
five...

745
01:10:14,507 --> 01:10:16,168
four...

746
01:10:16,209 --> 01:10:17,471
three...

747
01:10:17,510 --> 01:10:18,670
two...

748
01:10:19,712 --> 01:10:20,872
one.

749
01:11:19,719 --> 01:11:22,153
Get inside his brain.

750
01:13:21,107 --> 01:13:22,836
I'm in his memories.

751
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:35,886
Son of a hundred maniacs

752
01:14:13,993 --> 01:14:15,984
You ready for it, boy?

753
01:14:17,397 --> 01:14:20,992
You been a waste
since the day I took you in.

754
01:14:21,034 --> 01:14:23,764
Now it's time
to take your medicine.

755
01:14:29,576 --> 01:14:31,009
Thank you, sir.

756
01:14:32,979 --> 01:14:34,503
May I have another?

757
01:14:39,686 --> 01:14:41,654
You want to know
the secret of pain?

758
01:14:42,422 --> 01:14:45,118
If you just stop feeling it...

759
01:14:45,158 --> 01:14:46,352
you can start using it.

760
01:14:52,932 --> 01:14:54,092
Child killer!

761
01:15:14,254 --> 01:15:16,154
We know what you want.

762
01:15:16,189 --> 01:15:17,884
I want it all!

763
01:15:17,924 --> 01:15:19,255
Of course you do.

764
01:15:19,292 --> 01:15:20,418
Then open up.

765
01:15:20,460 --> 01:15:23,793
And you shall be forever!

766
01:15:51,357 --> 01:15:52,790
Mommy!

767
01:16:02,802 --> 01:16:04,827
Don't worry, baby.

768
01:16:04,871 --> 01:16:07,271
Mommy just had
to take her medicine...

769
01:16:07,307 --> 01:16:09,571
for snooping
in Daddy's special work.

770
01:16:12,245 --> 01:16:15,009
But you won't tell, will you?

771
01:16:15,815 --> 01:16:17,305
I won't tell.

772
01:16:28,528 --> 01:16:31,156
But you did tell, didn't you?

773
01:16:32,498 --> 01:16:36,434
And now it's time
to take your medicine.

774
01:16:41,874 --> 01:16:43,205
You killed my mother!

775
01:16:49,082 --> 01:16:50,242
She's got him!

776
01:16:51,317 --> 01:16:52,648
Let's get her out of there.

777
01:17:15,508 --> 01:17:16,736
I've got you!

778
01:17:24,317 --> 01:17:25,477
I had him!

779
01:17:26,386 --> 01:17:27,910
Where the hell is he?

780
01:17:30,556 --> 01:17:31,818
Maybe the trip killed him.

781
01:17:31,858 --> 01:17:34,019
No... because
I'm still seeing things...

782
01:17:34,694 --> 01:17:36,719
the way I did in my dream.

783
01:17:36,763 --> 01:17:37,525
It's not over. Let's go.

784
01:17:48,708 --> 01:17:50,403
The cops were supposed
to pick this stuff up.

785
01:17:50,443 --> 01:17:51,569
I'm glad they didn't.

786
01:17:51,611 --> 01:17:53,442
We'll have to hit him
with everything we've got.

787
01:17:57,650 --> 01:17:59,982
Check out this knife.

788
01:18:00,019 --> 01:18:01,816
- Hey, put that away.
- That's too small.

789
01:18:07,927 --> 01:18:09,588
Guess so.

790
01:18:09,629 --> 01:18:10,789
You sure that's big enough?

791
01:18:12,565 --> 01:18:14,089
Still believe
he's gonna show up, huh?

792
01:18:15,201 --> 01:18:16,463
Come on, Tracy. Over here.

793
01:18:19,072 --> 01:18:20,539
I can feel it.

794
01:18:52,438 --> 01:18:54,065
You're real here.

795
01:18:54,107 --> 01:18:55,904
It wasn't my fault.

796
01:18:56,642 --> 01:18:57,802
It wasn't.

797
01:18:58,845 --> 01:19:02,178
You saw what they did to me
when I was a kid.

798
01:19:02,215 --> 01:19:03,512
You saw.

799
01:19:05,284 --> 01:19:06,876
I loved you.

800
01:19:08,521 --> 01:19:10,284
And your mother.

801
01:19:10,323 --> 01:19:13,121
I tried so hard to be good.

802
01:19:14,594 --> 01:19:15,925
I know, Daddy.

803
01:19:16,896 --> 01:19:18,796
But when they took you
from me...

804
01:19:19,499 --> 01:19:20,625
it wasn't right.

805
01:19:20,666 --> 01:19:23,191
Oh, I knew you'd believe me.

806
01:19:24,804 --> 01:19:25,964
Come to Daddy.

807
01:19:41,154 --> 01:19:42,485
Over here!

808
01:19:43,456 --> 01:19:44,946
I'm OK.

809
01:19:45,725 --> 01:19:46,987
Maggie, watch out!

810
01:19:53,533 --> 01:19:55,467
- Where's the key?
- I don't know!

811
01:19:56,736 --> 01:19:57,930
The lock's jammed!

812
01:19:57,970 --> 01:19:59,938
I didn't need a glove...

813
01:19:59,972 --> 01:20:02,031
to kill your bitch
of a mother...

814
01:20:02,074 --> 01:20:05,737
and I don't need one now!

815
01:20:14,220 --> 01:20:16,120
Come on.

816
01:20:16,155 --> 01:20:17,486
Let go.

817
01:20:24,430 --> 01:20:25,863
I'll show you how.

818
01:20:32,738 --> 01:20:34,296
Like you showed my mother?

819
01:20:34,340 --> 01:20:35,568
And Carlos?

820
01:20:37,443 --> 01:20:38,603
And Spencer?

821
01:20:40,279 --> 01:20:42,577
Give Daddy the glove back,
princess.

822
01:20:42,615 --> 01:20:43,775
Never!

823
01:20:45,918 --> 01:20:47,078
Give it to me!

824
01:20:49,956 --> 01:20:51,548
Gimme the glove!

825
01:20:55,061 --> 01:20:57,120
In your dreams!

826
01:21:13,746 --> 01:21:17,375
Oh, Daddy, I remember when we
used to hold hands together...

827
01:21:17,416 --> 01:21:19,350
when I was a kid.

828
01:21:19,385 --> 01:21:20,545
I didn't like it then, either!

829
01:21:23,689 --> 01:21:26,317
I forgot how much it hurts
to be human.

830
01:22:37,063 --> 01:22:38,291
Go ahead...

831
01:22:38,998 --> 01:22:40,488
put it on.

832
01:22:42,735 --> 01:22:44,259
It's in your blood.

833
01:23:00,753 --> 01:23:02,311
That's it. Put it on.

834
01:23:05,191 --> 01:23:07,125
Feels good, doesn't it?

835
01:23:09,028 --> 01:23:11,690
Yeah... come on.

836
01:23:12,898 --> 01:23:16,026
Let your daddy show you
how to use it.

837
01:23:41,761 --> 01:23:43,729
Happy Father's Day.

838
01:23:43,763 --> 01:23:45,094
Come on, Doc!

839
01:23:49,235 --> 01:23:50,361
Come on! Let's hurry!

840
01:23:50,403 --> 01:23:51,700
Let's get outta here! Come on!

841
01:23:51,737 --> 01:23:54,797
Oh... kids.

842
01:24:07,653 --> 01:24:09,120
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm OK.

843
01:24:23,401 --> 01:24:24,834
Freddy's dead.
