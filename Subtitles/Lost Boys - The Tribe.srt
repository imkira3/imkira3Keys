00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:05,431
Well, this--
This chick came into my house and--

483
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:10,436
And she sprouted fangs and then she
turned into stone and exploded.

484
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:14,232
Now, that's just ridiculous.

485
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:17,151
Vampires don't just turn into stone
and then explode.

486
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:20,780
They have to be pierced through the heart
with a sharp object.

487

You know, I guess
the antlers could have done that.

it doesn't have to be sharp.

00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:35,670
It can be a blunt object,
as long as it pierces the heart.

and you give me comic books?

...see here?

This poor sap's drinking the blood
of the head vampire.

503
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:09,787
They like to trick people
by putting it into wine bottles.

...my sister drank blood
and now she's a vampire.

509

Half. She's only half vampire.

510
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:02,048
She won't make the transition to full
bloodsucker until she makes her first kill.

-Great.
-That is great, actually.
