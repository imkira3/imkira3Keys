She's married to

No, it's the Magic Mirror, sire.

but there's one thing you forgot.

353
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:08,201
You are not a king, My Liege,
and so a kingdom this is not.

354
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:10,366
Uh, Thelonius.

355
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:13,160
You were saying?

356
00:24:13,327 --> 00:24:16,422
What I mean is, you're not a king yet,
but you can become one.

357
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,378
All you have to do is
marry a princess.

358
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,464
- Go on.
- So just sit back and relax, My Lord,

<i>She may live with seven other men,

<i>Just kiss her dead, frozen lips

<i>- Come on, give it up for Snow White!
- She's in Tupperware.</i>

374
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:04,928
<i>Bachelorette number
three lives in a dragon-guarded castle,</i>

375

<i>surrounded by hot boiling lava!</i>

376

<i>- But don't let that cool you off.</i>

377
00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:12,641
<i>She likes piña coladas

<i>Yours for the rescuing,
Princess Fiona!</i>

<i>- I don't know!
- ...bachelorette number two,</i>

381
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:24,945
- or bachelorette number three?
- They're all so nice. I don't know.

382
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:27,610
Boys, what do you say?
One, two, three, one, three, one?

383

One, three, two, three...

Except for that dragon and lava thing.
I'll have to find someone else to go.

388

You know, I should probably mention
this little thing about the princess

389
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:55,725
- that happens at night.
- I will make Fiona my queen,

have the perfect king!

00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:45,426
You've won the honor of embarking
on a great and noble quest!

600
00:39:45,592 --> 00:39:47,594
- But we're already on a quest.
- To get my swamp back!

601
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,137
Yes, and you've nearly
accomplished it!

602
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:52,148
All you need to do
is one more simple little task,

603
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:54,435
and I'll hand over
the deed to your swamp.

604
00:39:54,601 --> 00:39:56,569
And what exactly is
this little task?

605
00:39:56,728 --> 00:40:00,028
There's just this package
that I need picked up.

606
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:03,819

Little task, my hoof!

Rescue a princess? Fight a dragon?
Man, we got jacked!

616
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:55,294
We? I don't remember inviting a
donkey on this leg of the journey.

617
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:56,204
I don't get it, Shrek.

618
00:40:56,371 --> 00:40:58,794
Why didn't you just make him
give you your swamp back?

619
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:00,675
Ooh! Pull some of that
ogre stuff on him.

620

You know, throttle him,
lay siege to his fortress.

621
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:05,717
- The whole ogre trip.
- For your information,

622
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,178
there's a lot more to ogres
than people think.

623
00:41:08,341 --> 00:41:12,391
- Hm. Example?
- Example. OK.

624
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:15,648
Ogres are like onions.

625
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:17,684
- They stink?
- Yes. No!

626
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:18,976
- Uh, they make you cry?
- No!

627
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:20,736
You leave them out in the sun,
they get all brown

628
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:22,897
and start sprouting
little white hairs.

629
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:26,902
No! Layers.
Onions have layers.

630
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:30,994
Ogres have layers.

631
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,783
Onions have layers. You get it?
We both have layers!

632
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:36,453
<i>Oh... You both got layers.</i>

633
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:38,292
But you know,
not everybody likes onions.

634
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:42,300
Parfaits! Everybody likes parfaits,
and they have layers!

635
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:45,883
Have you ever met a person that said,
"Hey, let's get some parfaits,"

636
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:49,345
and they be like,
"Hell no, I don't like no parfaits!"

637
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:53,682
- Parfaits are delicious.
- I don't care!

638
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:55,097
Ogres are not like parfaits!

639
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:58,767
Parfaits might be the most delicious
thing on the whole damn planet.

640
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:02,779
This may turn into the longest day

- Well, so much for "noble steed."
- You're not supposed to be an ogre.

899
00:58:58,452 --> 00:59:02,753
Princess, I was sent to rescue you
by Lord Farquaad, OK?

900
00:59:02,914 --> 00:59:04,291
He's the one who
wants to marry you.

901
00:59:04,458 --> 00:59:06,005
Then why didn't he
come and rescue me?

902
00:59:06,168 --> 00:59:08,762
Good question. You should ask him that
when we get there tomorrow.

903
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:10,297
Tomorrow?

904
00:59:10,464 --> 00:59:12,307
- Oh, my gosh, it's almost sunset!
- So?

905
00:59:12,466 --> 00:59:15,140
Oh, uh... I didn't realize
it was so late. We need to make camp.

906
00:59:15,302 --> 00:59:17,145
Camp?
But you've just escaped!

907
00:59:17,304 --> 00:59:19,022
Yes, and I found the whole ordeal
quite exhausting.

908
00:59:19,181 --> 00:59:20,182
I need to rest immediately.

909
00:59:20,348 --> 00:59:21,816
That's unfortunate,
because we're gonna keep going.

910
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:23,977
I need to find somewhere
to camp right now!

911
00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:27,322
Very well.
There's a cave right there.

912
00:59:27,481 --> 00:59:29,404
- That is no place for a princess.
- No, it's perfect.

913
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:30,818
Well, gentlemen,
I bid thee good night!

914
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:32,736
You want me to read you a bedtime story?
'Cause I will.

915
00:59:32,903 --> 00:59:34,155
I said good night!

916
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:38,412
She seems nice.

917
00:59:42,162 --> 00:59:45,006
<i>"By day one way,
by night another,</i>

918
00:59:45,165 --> 00:59:50,012
<i>this shall be the norm, until
you find true love's first kiss</i>

919
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:53,219
<i>and then take love's true form."</i>

920
00:59:57,469 --> 01:00:00,393
And this is what I realized,
if we escaped a dragon,

921
01:00:00,555 --> 01:00:03,274
man, we could do anything.

922
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:06,152
Hey, I could be a steed.

923
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:09,736
Ooh! Or I could work
the Crusades circuit if I wanted to.

924
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:15,408
I could even be one of those horses
that pulls those wagons full of beer!

925
01:00:19,533 --> 01:00:22,537
I'd have to get some hair extensions
on my ankles, but I could do it.

926
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:28,254
- Who do you wanna be?
- I don't want to be anyone.

927
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:29,668
Just for fun, though,
who would you pick?

928
01:00:29,835 --> 01:00:31,212
- I wouldn't. Donkey...
- No, but if you had to.

929
01:00:31,378 --> 01:00:33,301
Like, if a guy had a sword
at your throat and he was like,

930
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:36,433
"Look here, you can't be an ogre
anymore, pick something else,"

931
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:37,934
then who would you pick?

932
01:00:38,093 --> 01:00:41,222
I would pick that guy up
and hurl him into a tree!

933
01:00:42,139 --> 01:00:44,016
Man, you are no fun at all,
you know it?

934
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:47,231
Is this what it's gonna be like
when we finish rescuing the princess?

935
01:00:47,394 --> 01:00:49,567
Us sitting around our swamp
all day doing nothing?

936
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:54,030
Our swamp? Donkey, there is no "our."
There's no "we."

937
01:00:54,192 --> 01:00:57,241
There's just me and my swamp.
And when I do get back,

938
01:00:57,404 --> 01:01:01,204
the first thing I'm going to do is
build a ten-foot wall around my land.

939
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:07,543
You cut me deep, Shrek.

940
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:11,335
You cut me real deep just now.

941
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:15,593
What's your problem anyway?
What you got against the whole world?

942
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:18,099
I'm not the one with
the problem, OK?

943
01:01:18,258 --> 01:01:21,432
It's the world who seems
to have a problem with me.

944
01:01:21,595 --> 01:01:25,099
You saw how that princess reacted.
That's how it always is.

945
01:01:25,265 --> 01:01:30,817
People take one look at me and it's all,
"Help! A big, stupid, ugly ogre!"

946
01:01:34,274 --> 01:01:37,528
They judge me
before they even know me.

947
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:41,949
That's why I'm
better off alone.

948
01:01:44,910 --> 01:01:46,958
But you know what, Shrek?

949
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:49,088
When we met,

950
01:01:49,247 --> 01:01:52,797
I didn't think you <i>was</i> just
a big, stupid, ugly ogre.

951
01:01:58,131 --> 01:01:59,428
Yeah, I know.

952
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:09,814
So there's really no one else
you'd rather be?

Why, good morning, men.

1058
01:12:08,241 --> 01:12:09,584
Mornin'.

1059
01:12:09,742 --> 01:12:12,165
Uh, Princess,
did you by any chance eat

1060
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:14,956
a few of those funny little
mushrooms by the stream?

1061
01:12:15,122 --> 01:12:17,170
Of course not.

1062
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:20,086
I'm just happy that it's a new day,

1063
01:12:20,253 --> 01:12:22,847
full of promise and fresh starts.

1064
01:12:23,005 --> 01:12:24,678
And the first thing
I would like to do

1065
01:12:24,841 --> 01:12:27,264
is to apologize
for my behavior yesterday.

1066
01:12:27,426 --> 01:12:31,431
We obviously got off on the wrong foot,
and I would like to make it up to you.

1067
01:12:31,597 --> 01:12:33,224
- You would?
- Yes.

1068
01:12:33,391 --> 01:12:36,019
You did rescue me, after all.

1069
01:12:36,185 --> 01:12:39,189
So I've gathered a basket
of berries for the trip,

1070
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:44,077
and I made you each...
 a daisy chain!

1071
01:12:44,235 --> 01:12:47,535
Oh, wow! Look at these!
They're beautiful, Princess!

1072
01:12:47,697 --> 01:12:50,576
- Aren't they beautiful, Shrek?
- Oh... Oh...

1073
01:12:50,741 --> 01:12:54,587
Oh! You'll grow to love them,
I promise. Lead the way!

1074
01:12:55,413 --> 01:12:57,666
So, uh...

1075
01:13:00,459 --> 01:13:03,554
So, Princess,
do you often frolic with rats?

1076
01:13:03,713 --> 01:13:04,680
And what if I do?

1077
01:13:04,839 --> 01:13:08,343
Oh, I don't know, Princess,
germ-infested vermin,

1078
01:13:08,509 --> 01:13:10,102
not exactly what I expected.

1079
01:13:10,261 --> 01:13:14,186
Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people
before you get to know them.

1080
01:13:14,348 --> 01:13:15,349
Ouch!

1081
01:13:17,435 --> 01:13:22,487
So, tell me about my groom-to-be,
Lord Farquaad. What's he like?

1082
01:13:22,648 --> 01:13:27,119
Well, um,
let me put it this way, Princess,

1083
01:13:27,278 --> 01:13:31,158
men of Farquaad's stature
are in short supply.

1084
01:13:32,450 --> 01:13:36,171
- Really?
- Yeah, but he is a little intimidating.

1085
01:13:36,329 --> 01:13:39,924
- Well, he must be!
- And yet very good at small talk.

1086
01:13:46,672 --> 01:13:48,515
What are you guys doing?

1087
01:13:48,674 --> 01:13:53,851
What? Just saying you might
want to lower your expectations a bit.

1088
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:58,484
Yes, like three feet or so.

1089
01:13:58,643 --> 01:14:02,693
All right, all right, yuck it up.
It doesn't bother me. Not today.

1090
01:14:02,855 --> 01:14:06,610
After a lifetime of misery,
things are finally going my way.

1091
01:14:06,776 --> 01:14:10,872
Oh...
A lifetime of misery, right. OK.

1092
01:14:17,286 --> 01:14:18,629
- You chuckled.
- Huh?

1093
01:14:18,788 --> 01:14:22,213
When I said "lifetime of misery,"
you chuckled.

1094
01:14:23,542 --> 01:14:24,919
- Did I?
- Yes.

1095
01:14:25,086 --> 01:14:29,967
Look, I'm sure it was very difficult
living in a dragon-guarded tower.

1096
01:14:30,132 --> 01:14:31,850
- It was.
- I'm sure.

1097
01:14:34,261 --> 01:14:35,729
All right, then.

1098
01:14:37,556 --> 01:14:40,400
Although, it must've been nice
to have a roof and a cozy bed.

1099
01:14:40,559 --> 01:14:42,857
Which is more
than I had when I left home.

1100
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:45,864
You're not actually comparing yourself
to what I endured?

1101
01:14:46,023 --> 01:14:50,153
I'm just saying you don't corner
the market on unhappy childhoods.

1102
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:53,619
There are things you
don't know, you know.

1103
01:14:53,781 --> 01:14:55,658
About me.
About how rough I had it!

1104
01:14:55,825 --> 01:14:58,248
What, you run out of
shampoo a couple of times?

1105
01:14:59,912 --> 01:15:02,131
- I mean about my life!
- In that cushy tower of yours?

1106
01:15:02,289 --> 01:15:04,007

01:30:00,729 --> 01:30:03,733
- Good night.
- Good night.

1341
01:30:08,153 --> 01:30:09,154
Uh-uh.

1342
01:30:09,321 --> 01:30:11,289
No, sir. I'm sorry,
but I did not come this whole way,

1343
01:30:11,448 --> 01:30:12,574
putting up with you
and your body odor,

1344
01:30:12,741 --> 01:30:14,414
just so you can let her
walk away like that!

1345
01:30:14,576 --> 01:30:17,546
- What are you talking about?
- I'm an animal, and I got instincts.

1346
01:30:18,163 --> 01:30:20,006
And you two were obviously
digging on each other.

1347
01:30:20,165 --> 01:30:22,839
Oh, you're crazy.
I'm just bringing her back to Farquaad.

1348
01:30:23,001 --> 01:30:24,844
So you don't have
any feelings for her at all?

1349
01:30:25,003 --> 01:30:29,975
Look, even if I did and
I'm not saying I do, because I don't.

1350
01:30:30,133 --> 01:30:32,056
She's a princess and I'm...

1351
01:30:32,218 --> 01:30:34,016
- An ogre?
- Yeah.

1352
01:30:34,179 --> 01:30:36,523
- An ogre.
- She needs to know.

1353
01:30:36,681 --> 01:30:38,149
- Hey, where you going?
- To get more wood,

1354
01:30:38,308 --> 01:30:40,060
before your fire dies.

1355
01:30:57,452 --> 01:30:58,453
Princess.

1356
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:04,418
Princess Fiona.

1357
01:31:05,335 --> 01:31:07,133
Princess, where are you?

1358
01:31:08,338 --> 01:31:10,636
Princess, it's very spooky in here,
I ain't playing no games... Oh!

1359
01:31:10,799 --> 01:31:12,597
- No! Help! Shrek!
- Oh, no, no, no! It's OK!

1360
01:31:12,759 --> 01:31:15,888
- What'd you do with the princess?
- Donkey, I am the princess. It's me.

1361
01:31:16,054 --> 01:31:19,479
- In this body.
- Oh, my God. You ate the princess!

1362
01:31:19,641 --> 01:31:22,770
Can you hear me? Keep breathing!
I'll get you out of there!

1363
01:31:22,936 --> 01:31:24,233
Donkey!

1364
01:31:26,314 --> 01:31:27,315
Princess?

1365
01:31:28,733 --> 01:31:30,235
What happened to you?

1366
01:31:30,402 --> 01:31:33,406
"By day one way,
by night another,

1367
01:31:33,571 --> 01:31:37,201
this shall be the norm, until
you find true love's first kiss

1368
01:31:37,367 --> 01:31:40,120
and then take love's true form."

1369
01:31:40,286 --> 01:31:43,130
That's beautiful.
I didn't know you wrote poetry.

1370
01:31:43,289 --> 01:31:45,542
Donkey, it's a curse.
I've had it since I was girl.

1371
01:31:45,709 --> 01:31:48,212
- A curse?
- A witch cast a spell on me.

1372
01:31:48,378 --> 01:31:51,882
Now every night, when the sun
goes down I become this...

1373
01:31:52,048 --> 01:31:53,595
...this horrible,
ugly beast!

1374
01:31:53,758 --> 01:31:56,227
All right, calm down,
you're not that ugly.

1375
01:31:58,096 --> 01:32:00,519
OK, I'm not gonna lie,
you are ugly,

1376
01:32:00,682 --> 01:32:05,279
but you only look like this at night.
Shrek's ugly 24/7.

1377
01:32:05,437 --> 01:32:08,236
- Wait a second, that's perfect!
- Perfect? Donkey,

1378
01:32:08,398 --> 01:32:11,072
if Lord Farquaad finds out I look
like this, he'll never marry me!

1379
01:32:11,234 --> 01:32:13,908
- So?
- So, I have to kiss my true love!

1380
01:32:14,070 --> 01:32:17,165
The kiss is the only thing that will
break the spell and make me beautiful.

1381
01:32:17,323 --> 01:32:20,167
But, you know,
you're kind of an ogre, and Shrek...

1382
01:32:20,326 --> 01:32:21,953
Well, you got a lot in common.

1383
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:23,463
- Shrek?
- Yeah, if he knew all this,

1384
01:32:23,621 --> 01:32:25,373
- I think maybe...
- No, wait, wait, wait, he can't know.

1385
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:28,464
And you can't tell him! Not a word!
No one must ever know!

1386
01:32:28,626 --> 01:32:30,924
- Promise you won't tell. Promise!
- All right, all right.

1387
01:32:31,087 --> 01:32:34,637
I won't tell him.
But you should.

1388
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:37,017
Man, I know when
this is all over,

1389
01:32:37,177 --> 01:32:39,475
I'm gonna need a whole lot
of serious therapy.

1390
01:32:41,014 --> 01:32:43,187
Princess, I...

1391
01:32:44,809 --> 01:32:46,903
How's it going first of all?
Good?

1392
01:32:47,896 --> 01:32:50,319
Good for me, too. I'm OK.

1393
01:32:50,482 --> 01:32:52,155

the deed has been put in your name.

Hm?

That is so sweet, but you don't have
to waste good manners on the ogre.

It's not like it has feelings.

No, you're right, it doesn't.

beautiful, fair, flawless Fiona.

Will you be the perfect bride
for the perfect groom?

1472
01:38:53,845 --> 01:38:55,347
Lord Farquaad, I accept.
Nothing would make me...

1473
01:38:55,513 --> 01:38:57,231
Excellent! I'll start the plans,
for tomorrow we wed!

1474
01:38:57,390 --> 01:39:00,018
No! I mean, why wait?

1475

You're right. The sooner the better.

ride ahead. Tell them it's a Code Red!

- Fare thee well, ogre.

Shrek! Shrek, what are you doing?
You're letting her get away!

1482
01:39:25,334 --> 01:39:27,553
Look, there's something you don't know!
I talked to her last night and...

1483
01:39:27,712 --> 01:39:29,385
Yeah, I know you
talked to her last night.

1484
01:39:29,547 --> 01:39:32,642
You two are great pals, aren't you?
So why don't you follow her home?

1485
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:35,474
- But Shrek, I want to go home with you.
- Hey, I told you already,

1486
01:39:35,678 --> 01:39:40,525
I live alone! My swamp, me!

1635
01:49:36,487 --> 01:49:39,161
She wasn't talking about you!
She was talking about hersel...

1636
01:49:41,700 --> 01:49:42,872
...someone else.

1637
01:49:43,035 --> 01:49:46,835
She wasn't talking about me?
Well then, who was she talking about?

1638
01:49:46,997 --> 01:49:49,170
No, sir. I ain't saying nothing.

1639
01:49:49,333 --> 01:49:50,801
You don't wanna listen to me, right?
Right?

1640
01:49:50,959 --> 01:49:52,256
- Donkey!
- No.

1641
01:49:55,964 --> 01:49:57,682
OK, look, I'm sorry, all right?

1642
01:50:00,302 --> 01:50:01,303
I'm sorry.

1643
01:50:02,262 --> 01:50:07,689
I guess I am just
a big, stupid, ugly ogre.

1644
01:50:10,604 --> 01:50:12,151
Can you forgive me?

1645
01:50:15,692 --> 01:50:16,864
Hey, that's what friends are for,
right?

1646
01:50:17,027 --> 01:50:18,028
Right.

1647
01:50:20,823 --> 01:50:22,917
- Friends?
- Oh! Friends!

1648
01:50:25,327 --> 01:50:27,500
So, what did Fiona
say about me?

1649
01:50:27,663 --> 01:50:29,916
What are you asking me for?
Why don't you just go ask her?

1650
01:50:30,082 --> 01:50:31,379
Donkey!
The wedding!

1651
01:50:31,542 --> 01:50:34,546
- We'll never make it in time!
- I know someone who can help!

1652
01:51:07,619 --> 01:51:11,089
People of Duloc,

1653
01:51:11,248 --> 01:51:15,128
we gather here today to bear witness

1654
01:51:15,294 --> 01:51:19,595
to the union of our
new king and queen.

1655
01:51:19,756 --> 01:51:25,513
And as the warm glow
of this setting sun lifts our heads,

1656
01:51:25,679 --> 01:51:28,102
so too does the...

1657
01:51:28,265 --> 01:51:31,439
Excuse me.
Could we just skip to the "I do's"?

1658
01:51:31,602 --> 01:51:34,606
- What?
- Uh, yeah. Go on, go on.

1659
01:51:34,771 --> 01:51:37,945
Right, well then, do you, Lord Farquaad,
take Princess Fiona?

1660
01:51:38,108 --> 01:51:39,109
- I do.
- And do you...

1661
01:51:39,276 --> 01:51:41,028
- I do.
- Yes, I thought you might.

1662
01:51:41,195 --> 01:51:42,572
Well, then,
by the power vested in me...

1663
01:51:42,738 --> 01:51:43,955
- Stop the wedding!
- Shrek?

1664
01:51:44,114 --> 01:51:45,536
What does he want?
Really, it's rude enough

1665
01:51:45,699 --> 01:51:49,624
being alive when no one wants you,
but showing up uninvited to a wedding?

1666
01:51:49,786 --> 01:51:51,834
- Fiona, I need to talk to you.
- Oh, now you want to talk?

1667
01:51:51,997 --> 01:51:53,999
Well, it's a little late for that,
so if you'll excuse me...

1668
01:51:54,166 --> 01:51:56,089
- But you can't marry him!
- And why not?

1669
01:51:56,251 --> 01:51:58,595
Because he's just marrying you
so he can be king.

1670
01:51:58,754 --> 01:51:59,971
That is outrageous!

1671
01:52:00,130 --> 01:52:02,303
- Fiona, don't listen to him.
- He's not your true love.

1672
01:52:02,466 --> 01:52:03,968
And what do you know
about true love?

1673
01:52:04,134 --> 01:52:08,014
Well... I...

1674
01:52:09,681 --> 01:52:10,807
Um...

Aw...

1677
01:52:18,023 --> 01:52:20,492
Well, this is precious. Huh? Hm?

1678
01:52:20,651 --> 01:52:23,700
The ogre has fallen in love
with the princess. Oh, good Lord.

1679
01:52:27,449 --> 01:52:30,293
Mm! Guards, take this abomination
out of my sight!

1680
01:52:30,452 --> 01:52:31,453
No!

1681
01:52:32,829 --> 01:52:36,379
I mean...

1682
01:52:36,541 --> 01:52:40,591
Let's hear what the monster has to say.
It might be worth a laugh.

1683
01:52:41,171 --> 01:52:42,593
Oh, you are awful.

1684
01:52:44,841 --> 01:52:48,596
Well, you heard her, ogre.
Express yourself. Hm?

1685
01:52:48,762 --> 01:52:51,766
With as few grunts as possible.

1686
01:52:55,185 --> 01:52:59,110
Right. OK.
