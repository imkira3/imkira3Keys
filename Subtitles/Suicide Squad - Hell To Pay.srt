2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

3
00:00:27,857 --> 00:00:30,760
We're three kilometers
off the coast, Vertigo.

4
00:00:32,128 --> 00:00:33,764
Keep it steady, Manta.

5
00:00:35,232 --> 00:00:37,000
I'll go rouse the rabble.

6
00:00:39,536 --> 00:00:41,005
Time to move.

7
00:00:41,972 --> 00:00:43,871
I'm good to go.

8
00:00:43,873 --> 00:00:46,340
Sponge and Julie, not so sure.

9
00:00:46,342 --> 00:00:48,742
Didn't Waller get you
a room last night?

10
00:00:48,744 --> 00:00:50,678
Don't be a hater, Floyd.

11
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:54,215
Or are you just upset because
Waller didn't put you in charge.

12
00:00:54,217 --> 00:00:58,218
Yeah, why is that, Deadshot?
You usually run things.

13
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:01,489
She asked me if her dress
made her look fat.

14
00:01:01,491 --> 00:01:03,691
She's gotten cranky
since she lost weight.

15
00:01:03,693 --> 00:01:06,795
Not our issue.
Is it, Daddy?

16
00:01:06,797 --> 00:01:11,932
We are just having our second
honeymoon anywhere we can.

17
00:01:11,934 --> 00:01:14,935
<i>Not on my time, convict.</i>

18
00:01:14,937 --> 00:01:20,441
<i>The only one who gets
satisfied tonight is me.</i>

19
00:01:20,443 --> 00:01:26,013
<i>Your target is an underboss in the
Black Mask mob, Tobias Whale,</i>

20
00:01:26,015 --> 00:01:29,417
<i>who happens to sideline
in stolen intel.</i>

21
00:01:29,419 --> 00:01:32,753
<i>Tonight, he's delivering a
flash drive full of nastiness.</i>

22
00:01:32,755 --> 00:01:38,926
<i>Pay-offs to dictators, senators playing
footsies in the restroom, the usual.</i>

23
00:01:38,928 --> 00:01:41,363
<i>More importantly,
he has leaked info</i>

24
00:01:41,365 --> 00:01:45,132
<i>implicating our
very own operations.</i>

25
00:01:45,134 --> 00:01:49,170
<i>Needless to say, Mama would be very
disappointed if you screwed this up.</i>

26
00:01:49,172 --> 00:01:51,372
<i>So keep your heads
on the mission</i>

27
00:01:51,374 --> 00:01:53,711
<i>if you want to keep them
on your shoulders.</i>

28
00:01:54,544 --> 00:01:55,779
<i>Any questions?</i>

29
00:01:56,413 --> 00:01:57,878
<i>Good.</i>

30
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,782
<i>They're all yours, Vertigo.</i>

31
00:02:01,384 --> 00:02:03,787
<i>I'll be on radio silence
till you're done.</i>

32
00:02:04,821 --> 00:02:06,290
<i>Waller out.</i>

33
00:02:07,824 --> 00:02:09,293
You heard the lady.

34
00:02:40,756 --> 00:02:42,424
Show off.

35
00:03:01,377 --> 00:03:03,046
All right, goddamn it.

36
00:04:16,152 --> 00:04:20,287
So I says if the money's good,
who gives a shit, huh?

37
00:04:22,691 --> 00:04:24,426
Hey. Oh...

38
00:04:32,769 --> 00:04:35,039
Ah! Oh. Ugh!

39
00:04:40,075 --> 00:04:41,575
Ah!

40
00:04:52,054 --> 00:04:54,121
You still got it, baby.

41
00:04:54,123 --> 00:04:56,360
And it's all yours, Daddy.

42
00:06:26,248 --> 00:06:28,683
You're that fool, Deadshot.

43
00:06:28,685 --> 00:06:30,551
Ain't this some shit?

44
00:06:30,553 --> 00:06:34,222
Did Black Mask find out about
my sidekick and send you?

45
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:40,760
I'm gonna mess you up real good.

46
00:06:40,762 --> 00:06:42,399
It's his turn.

47
00:07:17,234 --> 00:07:22,272
Expletive deleted and the
free world is saved again.

48
00:07:29,813 --> 00:07:31,147
Stay down, dog.

49
00:07:32,114 --> 00:07:33,813
What the heck's going on?

50
00:07:33,815 --> 00:07:35,585
This wasn't part of the mission.

51
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:37,854
Vertigo...

52
00:07:49,464 --> 00:07:50,698
Why?

53
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,036
Aw, honeymoon's over.

54
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:59,342
What about him?

55
00:08:02,111 --> 00:08:04,778
I'd rather not kill him
at the same wound.

56
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,881
He'd wonder about that.

57
00:08:06,883 --> 00:08:10,618
I say we let the train
run him over.

58
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,152
You're working together?

59
00:08:12,154 --> 00:08:14,655
Working, playing...

60
00:08:14,657 --> 00:08:16,189
We're soulmates.

61
00:08:16,191 --> 00:08:19,027
Even in prison, things can be

62
00:08:19,029 --> 00:08:21,229
arranged.

63
00:08:21,231 --> 00:08:23,496
What about the file?

64
00:08:23,498 --> 00:08:26,299
We make a copy,
give Waller back the original.

65
00:08:26,301 --> 00:08:27,801
She'll never know

66
00:08:27,803 --> 00:08:32,407
and then, when the grieving
widow and I are paroled,

67
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:34,544
we'll have a little nest-egg.

68
00:08:35,577 --> 00:08:37,014
She knows.

69
00:08:37,481 --> 00:08:38,649
What?

70
00:08:39,281 --> 00:08:40,383
Waller.

71
00:08:41,784 --> 00:08:43,350
<i>She's been listening.</i>

72
00:08:43,352 --> 00:08:46,253
<i>You're lying,
I'm team leader.</i>

73
00:08:46,255 --> 00:08:48,357
She knew there was
a traitor somewhere.

74
00:08:53,696 --> 00:08:57,067
Waller? Listen to me, I beg to you.

75
00:09:12,082 --> 00:09:17,886
Floyd, please, don't let her.

76
00:09:17,888 --> 00:09:20,220
I know, I know I was a bad girl.

77
00:09:20,222 --> 00:09:22,956
And it was all Vertigo's idea.

78
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:25,960
Please don't let her
kill me, Floyd!

79
00:09:28,331 --> 00:09:30,267
Don't let her blow my head off.

80
00:09:35,838 --> 00:09:38,773
She's down, Waller. Turn it off.

81
00:09:38,775 --> 00:09:40,874
<i>A mercy killing.</i>

82
00:09:40,876 --> 00:09:42,712
Getting soft on me, Lawton?

83
00:09:47,951 --> 00:09:50,354
Just saving on the dry cleaning.

84
00:10:23,752 --> 00:10:25,952
Stop this madness.

85
00:10:25,954 --> 00:10:27,521
You can't get rid of me.

86
00:10:27,523 --> 00:10:31,392
I am not some vestigial twin
you can excise like a skin tag.

87
00:10:31,394 --> 00:10:35,529
Hey, Doc, I'm getting sick
of hearing this guy's crap.

88
00:10:35,531 --> 00:10:38,200
Ain't you got something
that'll knock him out.

89
00:10:38,768 --> 00:10:40,337
Anasthetic!

90
00:10:43,106 --> 00:10:44,741
Where is the anasthetic?

91
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:51,412
Well, that's just peachy.

92
00:10:51,414 --> 00:10:55,082
No anasthetic?
You're all insane!

93
00:10:55,084 --> 00:10:57,651
Shut your pie hole,
we're gonna do this.

94
00:10:57,653 --> 00:11:02,459
Just show me again, Doc,
one more time.

95
00:11:05,761 --> 00:11:06,994
Voila.

96
00:11:06,996 --> 00:11:10,400
Beautiful.

97
00:11:11,701 --> 00:11:13,437
No. No. No. No!

98
00:11:31,087 --> 00:11:32,588
Drill.

99
00:11:35,524 --> 00:11:39,826
We'll start around the eye.

100
00:11:45,869 --> 00:11:48,970
Oh, thank God, he was
going to disfigure me.

101
00:11:48,972 --> 00:11:50,573
That lunatic. That...

102
00:11:51,741 --> 00:11:53,474
How dare you?

103
00:11:53,476 --> 00:11:57,581
This is an operating theater
not some abattoir.

104
00:11:59,314 --> 00:12:01,748
We have a patient
for you, Professor.

105
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,652
A person in need of
medical attention.

106
00:12:04,654 --> 00:12:08,491
We're wondering if you could
clear your schedule. Hmm?

107
00:12:10,592 --> 00:12:15,397
A patient in need is always
my first consideration.

108
00:12:16,366 --> 00:12:17,766
Good answer.

109
00:12:56,405 --> 00:12:57,741
Mail call, Lawton.

110
00:13:20,797 --> 00:13:22,499
Morning, sunshine.

111
00:13:24,067 --> 00:13:26,702
Get another offer from
Gun Fund Monthly, did you?

112
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,801
No, wait a tick.

113
00:13:28,803 --> 00:13:30,539
It's your little girl, isn't it?

114
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:36,244
Aw, did she reject another
letter from dear old dad?

115
00:13:36,246 --> 00:13:39,080
How old is she now, 13, 14?

116
00:13:39,082 --> 00:13:43,653
Her uncle bought her any more, eh?
I get bored crazy in that age.

117
00:13:45,987 --> 00:13:49,022
Tell you what, girls like her
need a daddy.

118
00:13:49,024 --> 00:13:52,192
How'd you reckon?
Well, get paroled early

119
00:13:52,194 --> 00:13:54,230
maybe Uncle Digger
can look her up.

120
00:13:56,365 --> 00:13:59,298
Oh! Christ! Son of a...

121
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,701
You could've put my eye out.

122
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,103
Must be gettin' rusty.

123
00:14:02,105 --> 00:14:04,537
Boomer's government property.

124
00:14:04,539 --> 00:14:06,275
You break it, you buy it.

125
00:14:07,108 --> 00:14:08,611
Hiya, cowboy.

126
00:14:09,845 --> 00:14:11,677
How's Trix?

127
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:13,849
Oh, not that crazy broad again.

128
00:14:15,183 --> 00:14:17,718
My choices have been
dwindling lately.

129
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,120
I heard about
poor little Julie?

130
00:14:20,122 --> 00:14:21,854
Beats all my luck, you know.

131
00:14:21,856 --> 00:14:26,762
But I offered to give her a whole
new makeover with a baseball bat.

132
00:14:29,298 --> 00:14:30,431
Who else?

133
00:14:30,433 --> 00:14:31,731
You heard of Killer Frost?

134
00:14:31,733 --> 00:14:33,768
- The ice queen.
- Yeah.

135
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:36,771
Crystal Frost, a tough girl
from a tougher home.

136
00:14:36,773 --> 00:14:39,172
<i>Her parents were, well...</i>

137
00:14:39,174 --> 00:14:42,976
<i>Let's just say they could've
used some discipline themselves.</i>

138
00:14:42,978 --> 00:14:46,247
<i>Then her metahuman powers
kicked in,</i>

139
00:14:46,249 --> 00:14:49,286
<i>and suddenly, Mom and Dad
were put on ice.</i>

140
00:14:58,928 --> 00:15:02,930
<i>They never knew how cold
her heart really was.</i>

141
00:15:02,932 --> 00:15:09,470
<i>They say she couldn't be tamed, but I think
Little Crystal's warmed up to us considerably.</i>

142
00:15:09,472 --> 00:15:15,609
And then there's Copperhead, AKA
Sameer Park, a meta contortionist

143
00:15:15,611 --> 00:15:18,245
<i>heavily into extreme
body modification.</i>

144
00:15:18,247 --> 00:15:23,986
<i>If his bio tech tail isn't repulsive
enough, he also shoots acid venom.</i>

145
00:15:26,688 --> 00:15:28,591
Say hello, Copperhead.

146
00:15:33,996 --> 00:15:37,800
The last is Bronze Tiger,
AKA Ben Turner.

147
00:15:38,768 --> 00:15:41,638
<i>Ex-CIA, then vigilante.</i>

148
00:15:43,173 --> 00:15:46,676
<i>Possibly the greatest
martial artist in the world.</i>

149
00:15:49,911 --> 00:15:55,849
If it weren't for his vow never to take
an innocent life, I'd put him incharge.

150
00:16:01,423 --> 00:16:03,460
I can feel the love.

151
00:16:15,004 --> 00:16:16,402
Open wide, Ms. Frost.

152
00:16:16,404 --> 00:16:17,805
Bite me.

153
00:16:20,577 --> 00:16:23,110
Thank you. Try not to move.

154
00:16:23,112 --> 00:16:26,114
We wouldn't want the appartus
to go off accidentally.

155
00:16:26,116 --> 00:16:28,282
It happened once
to the ten-eyed man.

156
00:16:28,284 --> 00:16:29,519
Who?

157
00:16:30,052 --> 00:16:31,621
Exactly.

158
00:16:51,506 --> 00:16:53,407
Insertion's complete.

159
00:16:53,409 --> 00:16:55,010
Task force X is
locked and loaded.

160
00:16:58,747 --> 00:17:00,814
Woo-hoo!

161
00:17:00,816 --> 00:17:02,619
What's this all about, Waller?

162
00:17:03,651 --> 00:17:06,253
This is about making me
happy, Tiger.

163
00:17:06,255 --> 00:17:08,757
This time I'm searching
for something special.

164
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:12,159
A lost card.

165
00:17:12,161 --> 00:17:15,495
Just call the bank, honey.
They'll get you a new one.

166
00:17:15,497 --> 00:17:17,766
What's it got?
Some kind of code?

167
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,067
You might say.

168
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:22,936
The last person who had it
was this man.

169
00:17:22,938 --> 00:17:25,675
He calls himself "Steel Maxim."

170
00:17:26,475 --> 00:17:28,641
Seriously?

171
00:17:28,643 --> 00:17:32,846
<i>Late 20s, no distinguishing
marks, except for a tramp stamp.</i>

172
00:17:32,848 --> 00:17:34,380
<i>An Egyptian Ankh.</i>

173
00:17:34,382 --> 00:17:37,516
We think he played a part
in the card's disappearance.

174
00:17:37,518 --> 00:17:40,021
But he's been hard
to track down.

175
00:17:40,023 --> 00:17:44,257
Find him, and I'll slice a year
of all your sentences.

176
00:17:44,259 --> 00:17:48,160
Oh, great, only 87 more
suicide missions to go.

177
00:17:48,162 --> 00:17:49,198
Cheers, Waller.

178
00:17:50,999 --> 00:17:52,832
One more thing.

179
00:17:52,834 --> 00:17:54,734
This one's off the grid.

180
00:17:54,736 --> 00:17:57,937
You'll be dealing with me
directly and only me.

181
00:17:57,939 --> 00:18:00,206
Deadshot will be
your team leader.

182
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:04,378
I told you before, Waller, I don't
take orders from murderers.

183
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,748
Not even if I said, "Please"?

184
00:18:08,685 --> 00:18:12,119
I answer to a higher authority.

185
00:18:12,121 --> 00:18:16,122
Higher than Waller? That
sounds like blasphemy, mate.

186
00:18:16,124 --> 00:18:19,259
I'd say maybe we should
take this outside.

187
00:18:19,261 --> 00:18:20,860
But that's up to her.

188
00:18:20,862 --> 00:18:22,495
Settle down, love birds.

189
00:18:22,497 --> 00:18:25,534
It's too early to start
losing your heads just yet.

190
00:18:27,436 --> 00:18:30,273
I've requisitioned
this vehicle for your mission.

191
00:18:32,074 --> 00:18:33,907
You're kidding?

192
00:18:33,909 --> 00:18:37,112
Like I said,
this one is off the books.

193
00:18:38,281 --> 00:18:39,579
No hotels...

194
00:18:39,581 --> 00:18:42,449
Roadtrip!

195
00:18:42,451 --> 00:18:46,288
I guess that'll save us from having
to explain him to the concierge.

196
00:18:47,957 --> 00:18:49,158
Hiss.

197
00:18:50,692 --> 00:18:54,129
Hey, we got cheese dogs
and Chicken Nuggies!

198
00:18:56,064 --> 00:18:57,766
Blow me up now.

199
00:20:05,634 --> 00:20:07,202
It's about time.

200
00:20:08,137 --> 00:20:10,771
Your late, you waste of flesh.

201
00:20:10,773 --> 00:20:14,744
Banshee, is that any way
to talk to our associate?

202
00:20:17,213 --> 00:20:19,949
Please, see him in.

203
00:20:21,283 --> 00:20:23,582
Word is, they gave her
six months tops,

204
00:20:23,584 --> 00:20:25,519
so really wants the card
bad now.

205
00:20:25,521 --> 00:20:29,225
It's all there, all the information
Waller has on the card.

206
00:20:30,293 --> 00:20:33,593
Your text said
she sent out Task Force X.

207
00:20:33,595 --> 00:20:35,427
Last night,

208
00:20:35,429 --> 00:20:37,731
I tried to get these to you
sooner, but I have to be careful.

209
00:20:37,733 --> 00:20:40,501
The Wall has eyes everywhere.

210
00:20:40,503 --> 00:20:42,170
I shouldn't be gone too long.

211
00:20:46,342 --> 00:20:48,574
Uh, thanks.

212
00:20:48,576 --> 00:20:53,382
Before you rush off, you neglected to
tell me where Waller is sending them.

213
00:20:54,249 --> 00:20:56,148
Branson.

214
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:58,417
The man they're tracking, he's been
spotted there looking for work.

215
00:20:58,419 --> 00:20:59,822
What does he do?

216
00:21:00,522 --> 00:21:01,890
He's an...

217
00:21:02,792 --> 00:21:04,260
entertainer.

218
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:18,040
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Hey!

219
00:21:21,377 --> 00:21:22,745
Park in the back.

220
00:21:30,118 --> 00:21:32,355
Oh, yeah, whoo!

221
00:21:42,898 --> 00:21:45,366
- Woo-hoo, yeah!
- Curb it, clown.

222
00:21:45,368 --> 00:21:47,868
We don't wanna call attention
to ourselves.

223
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:52,673
Honey, in case you haven't
noticed, nobody's looking at us.

224
00:21:52,675 --> 00:21:54,974
- Split up.
- Dibs on backstage!

225
00:21:54,976 --> 00:21:57,013
Woo-hoo. I like that!

226
00:21:59,348 --> 00:22:00,817
I'm going.

227
00:22:07,756 --> 00:22:10,389
Look at the bag of marbles
on that fella.

228
00:22:10,391 --> 00:22:14,162
You missed your calling, Snake eyes,
chicks would go crazy for you.

229
00:22:14,996 --> 00:22:18,131
Bored now. Going out.

230
00:22:18,133 --> 00:22:20,600
Uh-uh, we're on standby.

231
00:22:20,602 --> 00:22:22,401
Deadshot gave us montior duty.

232
00:22:22,403 --> 00:22:25,539
So much for not taking orders
from murderers, eh, Benji?

233
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:27,308
Shut it, Boomer.

234
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,945
Sit your ass down.

235
00:22:29,678 --> 00:22:31,514
Make me, dolomite.

236
00:22:34,249 --> 00:22:36,149
I don't kill innocents.

237
00:22:36,151 --> 00:22:38,121
But I doubt if you'd qualify.

238
00:22:39,755 --> 00:22:41,288
Pull it back.

239
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:43,192
Or I'll rip your mouth in half.

240
00:22:49,998 --> 00:22:52,232
You're on a mission,

241
00:22:52,234 --> 00:22:56,938
you don't wander away, you don't make
trouble, and you don't piss me off.

242
00:23:10,451 --> 00:23:12,351
We didn't see him.

243
00:23:12,353 --> 00:23:14,119
This nut job was
frisking the boys.

244
00:23:14,121 --> 00:23:16,823
I had to cool her off.

245
00:23:16,825 --> 00:23:19,292
Psychotics have needs, you know?

246
00:23:19,294 --> 00:23:20,830
We have needs.

247
00:23:22,663 --> 00:23:24,266
We're moving to the next club.

248
00:23:25,167 --> 00:23:26,966
This is gonna take forever.

249
00:23:26,968 --> 00:23:29,869
Well, we could always
put up some flyers.

250
00:23:29,871 --> 00:23:35,175
<i>Ladies and ladies,
it's that king from Cairo,</i>

251
00:23:35,177 --> 00:23:37,476
<i>the sphinx of kinks,</i>

252
00:23:37,478 --> 00:23:43,451
<i>the sandstorm guaranteed
to blow you away.</i>

253
00:23:44,186 --> 00:23:46,052
Oh!

254
00:23:46,054 --> 00:23:50,857
<i>Get ready to sweat
for the Pharaoh!</i>

255
00:23:57,131 --> 00:23:58,935
Didn't see him backstage.

256
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,203
Me likey.

257
00:24:31,999 --> 00:24:33,236
It's him.

258
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:51,387
- Banshee! Oh, crap!
- Where're you going?

259
00:24:57,592 --> 00:24:58,628
Shit!

260
00:25:00,028 --> 00:25:02,564
Oh, crap! Oh, crap!
Oh, crap! Oh, crap!

261
00:25:26,921 --> 00:25:28,356
Uh. No!

262
00:25:51,546 --> 00:25:53,415
No!

263
00:25:58,521 --> 00:26:00,255
Oh, this is bad.

264
00:26:32,254 --> 00:26:33,522
Buddy Frankenstein?

265
00:26:48,838 --> 00:26:50,272
Whoa!

266
00:27:03,251 --> 00:27:05,488
Zoom, what the hell?

267
00:27:06,353 --> 00:27:08,355
What are you waiting for?

268
00:27:08,357 --> 00:27:10,393
Do I have to do everything?

269
00:27:16,198 --> 00:27:19,334
Hiya, cowboy, need a ride?

270
00:27:30,178 --> 00:27:31,546
Get us out of here!

271
00:27:41,524 --> 00:27:42,656
Heads up, mate.

272
00:27:43,859 --> 00:27:45,694
<i>Ha ha. Right in the gulleys.</i>

273
00:28:11,753 --> 00:28:14,454
- Something's wrong.
- Yeah, he's too fast for him.

274
00:28:14,456 --> 00:28:16,455
No, he's too slow.

275
00:28:16,457 --> 00:28:20,127
He should've broken into this
jalopy and killed us all by now.

276
00:28:20,129 --> 00:28:21,330
He's still mine.

277
00:28:27,034 --> 00:28:28,437
Frost, on the right!

278
00:28:45,754 --> 00:28:50,022
Pfft. Come on. You don't understand.
I've got a 10:00 a.m. call back

279
00:28:50,024 --> 00:28:51,425
for <i>Bachelor Babe.</i>

280
00:28:51,427 --> 00:28:54,026
Really? Aw, that's
my favorite show.

281
00:28:54,028 --> 00:28:58,531
It's so romantic like you're
the only girl at a frat party.

282
00:28:58,533 --> 00:29:02,369
Oh, you're not going anywhere,
buddy, until we get some answers.

283
00:29:02,371 --> 00:29:04,670
Like why're you
so popular with Zoom?

284
00:29:04,672 --> 00:29:07,040
How should I know?
I've never even seen the guy.

285
00:29:07,042 --> 00:29:09,009
But you knew Silver Banshee.

286
00:29:09,011 --> 00:29:11,477
The second you saw her,
you bolted.

287
00:29:11,479 --> 00:29:14,214
Yeah, everyone knows who
Silver Banshee is.

288
00:29:14,216 --> 00:29:16,315
Uh, no.

289
00:29:16,317 --> 00:29:20,453
Okay, okay, so we crossed
paths a few times. So what?

290
00:29:20,455 --> 00:29:22,187
Listen to this tosser.

291
00:29:22,189 --> 00:29:24,924
How'd a nobody like you
even get Banshee's attention?

292
00:29:24,926 --> 00:29:26,729
Because I was Fate.

293
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:30,964
Dr. Fate. I used to be
Dr. Fate, okay?

294
00:29:30,966 --> 00:29:33,032
Shut up.

295
00:29:33,034 --> 00:29:36,034
It's true. It's not like
I was the only one.

296
00:29:36,036 --> 00:29:37,503
There have been a lot of Fates.

297
00:29:37,505 --> 00:29:39,606
Uh, they're chosen by
the spirit of Nabu.

298
00:29:39,608 --> 00:29:42,009
Oh, yeah?
Why'd he choose you?

299
00:29:42,011 --> 00:29:43,676
Uh, why not me?

300
00:29:43,678 --> 00:29:45,779
Six percent body fat,
20 inch guns.

301
00:29:45,781 --> 00:29:48,113
Hell, I even took
a magic class once.

302
00:29:48,115 --> 00:29:52,484
<i>So, I was going strong at the end
of this 10k when I saw it, uh...</i>

303
00:29:52,486 --> 00:29:53,555
him.

304
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:57,525
<i>And at first,
I thought he was God.</i>

305
00:29:59,427 --> 00:30:01,764
<i>I just couldn't figure
what religion.</i>

306
00:30:03,732 --> 00:30:07,568
<i>And Nabu wasn't much of a talker
but when I had that helmet on,</i>

307
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:10,337
<i>it was like, I didn't need
to hear him at all.</i>

308
00:30:10,339 --> 00:30:13,840
<i>Like, I knew what to do.</i>

309
00:30:13,842 --> 00:30:17,010
<i>Let me tell you,
I was hella hot.</i>

310
00:30:17,012 --> 00:30:19,612
<i>Superhero-hot.</i>

311
00:30:19,614 --> 00:30:23,351
<i>Banshee was sprung as soon
as she laid eyes on moi.</i>

312
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:34,961
<i>I mean, come on. Sure she
played hard to get at first.</i>

313
00:30:34,963 --> 00:30:37,633
<i>But I know that
she knew what was up.</i>

314
00:30:39,234 --> 00:30:40,468
<i>Oh, she knew.</i>

315
00:30:41,636 --> 00:30:43,706
<i>Oh, yeah.
She knew.</i>

316
00:30:45,273 --> 00:30:47,506
Oh, my God, they did it.

317
00:30:47,508 --> 00:30:50,176
That was sweet day.

318
00:30:50,178 --> 00:30:52,611
<i>I mean, Nabu hooked me up
with my own place.</i>

319
00:30:52,613 --> 00:30:54,946
<i>Sometimes I'd have to
fight off hell dogs,</i>

320
00:30:54,948 --> 00:30:57,315
<i>and you know,
some crazy demons.</i>

321
00:30:57,317 --> 00:31:00,552
<i>But I spent most of the time
dusting his knick-knacks.</i>

322
00:31:00,554 --> 00:31:02,957
<i>This dude had everything
but a dead monkey.</i>

323
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:07,659
<i>But of all the junk,
the thing that Nabu cherished</i>

324
00:31:07,661 --> 00:31:10,298
<i>the absolute most
was the smallest.</i>

325
00:31:13,267 --> 00:31:15,533
<i>A shiny black card.</i>

326
00:31:15,535 --> 00:31:17,369
<i>It had writing on it.</i>

327
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:22,073
<i>"Get out of hell free?"</i>

328
00:31:22,075 --> 00:31:25,110
It's crazy, I know, I read about
it in one of Nabu's books.

329
00:31:25,112 --> 00:31:28,481
Supposedly, if you have this
card on you when you die,

330
00:31:28,483 --> 00:31:30,986
you bypass hell and
you go straight to heaven.

331
00:31:32,954 --> 00:31:34,686
Oh, like a DFA pass.

332
00:31:34,688 --> 00:31:37,057
Yeah.

333
00:31:37,059 --> 00:31:40,426
A whole lot of blood should we
start to have a card like that.

334
00:31:40,428 --> 00:31:45,932
Yeah, but only one person can
use it, then it's used up.

335
00:31:45,934 --> 00:31:50,070
All I know is that damn card
screwed up my situation for good.

336
00:31:50,072 --> 00:31:51,637
What do you mean?

337
00:31:51,639 --> 00:31:54,072
I'd been there about
two months, and it gets old.

338
00:31:54,074 --> 00:31:58,677
<i>So one evening, I hit this bar
and I meet this redhead.</i>

339
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:01,347
<i>And she's so hot.
So I said to her...</i>

340
00:32:01,349 --> 00:32:04,586
You don't know it yet, baby,
but you just met your fate.

341
00:32:07,421 --> 00:32:09,723
<i>Cornball? Yes, but it works.</i>

342
00:32:09,725 --> 00:32:12,328
<i>Especially when I bring her
back to my place.</i>

343
00:32:13,961 --> 00:32:16,396
<i>She had this girlfriend
with her, kinda hard and quiet,</i>

344
00:32:16,398 --> 00:32:19,599
<i>not really my type but
they were a package deal.</i>

345
00:32:19,601 --> 00:32:21,536
<i>Like I'm gonna say no to that?</i>

346
00:32:23,137 --> 00:32:25,605
<i>It started off great.</i>

347
00:32:25,607 --> 00:32:28,974
<i>But after a while,
I got a little suspicious</i>

348
00:32:28,976 --> 00:32:31,744
<i>'cause the butch one hadn't
joined in the fun yet.</i>

349
00:32:31,746 --> 00:32:34,546
<i>I mean, who can say no
to all of this. Am I right?</i>

350
00:32:34,548 --> 00:32:39,452
<i>And I catch her red-handed
boosting the freaking card.</i>

351
00:32:39,454 --> 00:32:40,889
<i>I mean, who does that?</i>

352
00:33:08,949 --> 00:33:11,586
<i>And the only thing they took
was the card.</i>

353
00:33:13,688 --> 00:33:15,724
<i>Everything else was untouched.</i>

354
00:33:17,559 --> 00:33:19,027
<i>Including me.</i>

355
00:33:20,262 --> 00:33:21,864
<i>You think he cared?</i>

356
00:33:27,936 --> 00:33:30,172
<i>He didn't even give me
a chance to explain.</i>

357
00:33:32,173 --> 00:33:36,842
A couple of days later, I called up
my girlfriend, and she was freaking.

358
00:33:36,844 --> 00:33:39,078
She said people were looking
for me, government types.

359
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,481
They were asking about the card.
Like I knew where it was.

360
00:33:41,483 --> 00:33:45,685
Anyway, she blocked me, so I called
up my sidechick, same thing.

361
00:33:45,687 --> 00:33:48,353
Finally, I ran out of options.

362
00:33:48,355 --> 00:33:53,024
So I changed my name and have
been lying low ever since.

363
00:33:53,026 --> 00:33:56,395
Calling yourself "Steel Maxim,"
and stripping.

364
00:33:56,397 --> 00:33:58,196
That's lying low to you?

365
00:33:58,198 --> 00:34:02,968
It's called hiding
in plain sight, sweetheart.

366
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:05,437
Anyway, you gotta believe me,
I had nothing to do

367
00:34:05,439 --> 00:34:09,009
with the card,
I swear on my life!

368
00:34:09,011 --> 00:34:10,843
<i>So who's Dr. Fate now?</i>

369
00:34:10,845 --> 00:34:12,577
<i>I heard Nabu
picked some chick.</i>

370
00:34:12,579 --> 00:34:14,847
You get all that?

371
00:34:14,849 --> 00:34:17,486
I got it.
He's telling the truth.

372
00:34:17,985 --> 00:34:19,919
Useless.

373
00:34:19,921 --> 00:34:22,622
But at least now,
we know who took the card.

374
00:34:22,624 --> 00:34:25,725
Sounded like Scandal Savage
and Knockout.

375
00:34:25,727 --> 00:34:28,160
But it didn't sound like
their kind of heist.

376
00:34:28,162 --> 00:34:29,695
It's not.

377
00:34:29,697 --> 00:34:33,099
I bet my eyeteeth that her daddy
Vandal Savage is on this.

378
00:34:33,101 --> 00:34:35,234
According to
the Justice League database,

379
00:34:35,236 --> 00:34:38,637
that bastard is
a 50,000 year old caveman

380
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:41,742
<i>who was affected by radiation
from a meteorite.</i>

381
00:34:42,477 --> 00:34:44,109
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

382
00:34:44,111 --> 00:34:47,879
Anyway, you might be familiar
with his other nom de plume.

383
00:34:47,881 --> 00:34:52,684
<i>Alexander the Great, Caesar,
Genghis Khan.</i>

384
00:34:52,686 --> 00:34:55,921
He's history's bloodiest tyrant.

385
00:34:55,923 --> 00:34:57,990
And you're going after him.

386
00:34:57,992 --> 00:35:02,595
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I didn't signup
to deal with an immortal butcher.

387
00:35:02,597 --> 00:35:04,530
You didn't sign up for anything.

388
00:35:04,532 --> 00:35:08,504
I run the op the way I want,
and I want that card, Deadshot.

389
00:35:11,472 --> 00:35:13,872
I need it.

390
00:35:13,874 --> 00:35:16,943
It's Savage, Waller,
you gotta give me something.

391
00:35:16,945 --> 00:35:18,945
But we already have Zoom
on our ass.

392
00:35:18,947 --> 00:35:20,883
I can't go back to them
with nothing.

393
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:24,015
Fine. Ten years.

394
00:35:24,017 --> 00:35:26,653
I'll give you ten years off.

395
00:35:26,655 --> 00:35:28,820
You know what that
means for you?

396
00:35:28,822 --> 00:35:30,091
You're out.

397
00:35:31,459 --> 00:35:32,861
If you're in...

398
00:35:40,769 --> 00:35:42,738
So when do we get the show
on the road?

399
00:35:45,273 --> 00:35:46,574
Drive.

400
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:57,653
What do we do
with Magic Mike?

401
00:36:04,793 --> 00:36:06,762
Hey!

402
00:36:08,628 --> 00:36:10,129
Not cool.

403
00:36:10,131 --> 00:36:13,068
At least you could call me
a car, assholes.

404
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,899
Which exit, cowboy?

405
00:36:46,901 --> 00:36:50,470
Waller said to keep going
north until we hear from her.

406
00:36:50,472 --> 00:36:52,805
I'm surprised she really
believes this mumbo-jumbo.

407
00:36:52,807 --> 00:36:54,307
- Do you?
- What?

408
00:36:54,309 --> 00:36:56,608
You know, that
you can skip hell.

409
00:36:56,610 --> 00:37:00,814
Beats me. I always thought
this was hell, Captain Kangaroo.

410
00:37:00,816 --> 00:37:03,350
Hey, all right.
First up, that's offensive.

411
00:37:03,352 --> 00:37:04,883
I'll tell you another thing.

412
00:37:04,885 --> 00:37:07,687
If any of us truly
deserves hell, it's Waller.

413
00:37:07,689 --> 00:37:09,021
And that bitch knows it.

414
00:37:09,023 --> 00:37:10,823
My God, the way she does.

415
00:37:10,825 --> 00:37:13,859
I ain't worrying. I know
I'm going to heaven.

416
00:37:13,861 --> 00:37:17,997
Anyone who can put up with
Mr. J deserves a break.

417
00:37:17,999 --> 00:37:20,466
The problem is, sweetheart,

418
00:37:20,468 --> 00:37:23,903
you have to die in order to find
out if the card really works.

419
00:37:23,905 --> 00:37:26,004
Pretty-bloody-embarrassing
if it didn't.

420
00:37:26,006 --> 00:37:28,006
What about you, gunman?

421
00:37:28,008 --> 00:37:30,809
You think the card will work
like the blood you spilled?

422
00:37:30,811 --> 00:37:32,979
Or don't you believe in heaven?

423
00:37:32,981 --> 00:37:34,850
I believe in heaven, Boomer.

424
00:37:36,418 --> 00:37:38,220
Everytime you shut your mouth.

425
00:37:40,956 --> 00:37:43,588
You joke about heaven
and hell, Deadshot.

426
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:46,959
But trust me, they exist.

427
00:37:46,961 --> 00:37:49,729
There's not a morning goes by
I don't get up wondering

428
00:37:49,731 --> 00:37:51,767
if this will be
my judgement day.

429
00:37:52,666 --> 00:37:55,367
Lined up with the woman I love.

430
00:37:55,369 --> 00:37:59,173
Will face the lake of hell fire with
the same vermin who brought me down.

431
00:38:01,709 --> 00:38:05,378
The only thing any of us can
hope for is divine intervention.

432
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:10,115
Only through the grace of God can
we be saved from eternal damnation.

433
00:38:10,117 --> 00:38:12,353
For all the blood we spilt...

434
00:38:14,222 --> 00:38:17,758
Everything else is just talk.

435
00:38:24,432 --> 00:38:26,935
So, guess the card
couldn't hurt then, eh?

436
00:38:32,472 --> 00:38:35,475
Dude, this is
the way they left me.

437
00:38:35,477 --> 00:38:36,809
I was kidnapped.

438
00:38:36,811 --> 00:38:38,577
Thats's what they all
say, buddy.

439
00:38:38,579 --> 00:38:40,745
We'll get you something pretty
to wear back at the station.

440
00:38:40,747 --> 00:38:42,249
Hope you like pink.

441
00:38:46,954 --> 00:38:49,454
Sorry, officer.

442
00:38:49,456 --> 00:38:52,293
But I think your tags
are about to expire.

443
00:38:52,927 --> 00:38:54,296
Oh, crap.

444
00:38:57,365 --> 00:38:59,664
<i>All right,
listen up, it turns out</i>

445
00:38:59,666 --> 00:39:03,535
<i>that Scandal Savage and her gal
pal have an apartment in Denver.</i>

446
00:39:03,537 --> 00:39:07,141
<i>There's a hidden safe. I'll
be sending you floor plans.</i>

447
00:39:11,178 --> 00:39:13,379
Yes, sir. We'll be ready.

448
00:39:13,381 --> 00:39:15,080
Wonderful.

449
00:39:15,082 --> 00:39:19,684
A few days without a scalpel in my
hand, I'll start to feel all fidgety.

450
00:39:19,686 --> 00:39:22,754
Better get dressed, babe.
The caveman cometh.

451
00:39:22,756 --> 00:39:26,160
Oh, about time. This little
piggy's been cramping our style.

452
00:39:29,831 --> 00:39:31,562
No peeking.

453
00:39:31,564 --> 00:39:34,200
Madam, I'm a surgeon.

454
00:39:34,202 --> 00:39:37,102
I've seen bodies before.

455
00:39:37,104 --> 00:39:38,539
Not like this one.

456
00:40:30,323 --> 00:40:31,827
Fun!

457
00:40:45,539 --> 00:40:50,175
I don't know why your papa wants me
for a job any bone cutter could do.

458
00:40:50,177 --> 00:40:54,278
My work is art,
it's transformational.

459
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:57,182
So is your bank account
if you do this right.

460
00:40:57,184 --> 00:41:00,218
I have been wanting this
since I escaped from Apocalypse.

461
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:02,990
Hmm, what do you think?
Too Wonder Woman?

462
00:41:03,724 --> 00:41:05,994
He likes Wonder Woman.

463
00:41:06,827 --> 00:41:08,426
There's only three.

464
00:41:08,428 --> 00:41:11,398
Some guy in cuffs
and a pig mask.

465
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,133
Kinky.

466
00:41:16,438 --> 00:41:18,874
They usually call up
first, don't they?

467
00:41:55,276 --> 00:41:57,111
Oh, God!

468
00:42:01,983 --> 00:42:04,019
I smell bacon.

469
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,022
You heard me.

470
00:42:15,796 --> 00:42:17,562
So far no one's died.

471
00:42:17,564 --> 00:42:20,068
Let's see how long
we can make that last.

472
00:42:26,106 --> 00:42:27,641
Now.

473
00:42:32,912 --> 00:42:34,412
It's here.

474
00:42:34,414 --> 00:42:37,149
Frost, how about a few
icy cuffs for the ladies?

475
00:43:01,441 --> 00:43:02,577
Balls.

476
00:43:31,372 --> 00:43:33,108
What a world. What a world!

477
00:43:44,918 --> 00:43:46,852
We can't get a clean shot.

478
00:43:46,854 --> 00:43:49,224
The woman is expendable.

479
00:44:53,419 --> 00:44:57,890
I know you could see me, Savage,
I got the card!

480
00:44:57,892 --> 00:44:59,425
You really want to kill me?

481
00:44:59,427 --> 00:45:01,526
I'm guessing no,
but then again,

482
00:45:01,528 --> 00:45:04,298
but who'd have guessed
a caveman believed in hell?

483
00:45:14,474 --> 00:45:16,108
Everyone, get behind me.

484
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:17,544
No fast moves.

485
00:45:20,081 --> 00:45:22,113
Can't negotiate with him.

486
00:45:22,115 --> 00:45:26,619
Right now, we're just playing
poker, and I've got the wild card.

487
00:45:26,621 --> 00:45:28,823
Well, that makes me feel
a lot better.

488
00:45:33,459 --> 00:45:35,394
Father, we must help her.

489
00:45:35,396 --> 00:45:37,164
Get Pyg onboard.

490
00:45:38,164 --> 00:45:40,200
She's dying, she can't be left.

491
00:45:47,974 --> 00:45:49,343
Get Pyg.

492
00:45:53,613 --> 00:45:56,381
Christ, I thought
you were a lousy father.

493
00:45:56,383 --> 00:45:58,785
Just move back nice and slow.

494
00:46:05,959 --> 00:46:08,260
We're like fish
in a freaking barrel.

495
00:46:08,262 --> 00:46:11,830
If you kill me,
your card gets used up.

496
00:46:11,832 --> 00:46:15,666
If you wound me,
my friends will finish the job.

497
00:46:15,668 --> 00:46:19,872
Either way, you lose
your ticket to heaven.

498
00:46:19,874 --> 00:46:24,579
Give me the card, and I'll
spare all your sorry lives.

499
00:46:25,246 --> 00:46:26,812
Sounds reasonable.

500
00:46:26,814 --> 00:46:28,247
We're so screwed.

501
00:46:28,249 --> 00:46:29,617
Okay.

502
00:46:33,921 --> 00:46:35,189
Oh, come on.

503
00:46:43,764 --> 00:46:45,733
You better be up there
snake man.

504
00:47:39,921 --> 00:47:44,090
Gee, Frosty, it's like
Christmas eveyday with you.

505
00:47:54,769 --> 00:47:57,772
Trust me, that one's
out of order.

506
00:48:14,222 --> 00:48:15,957
Damn it, we're too late.

507
00:48:17,858 --> 00:48:20,158
So they didn't get the card.

508
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,961
At least we know who's got it.

509
00:48:22,963 --> 00:48:25,696
Savage has disappeared
for decades.

510
00:48:25,698 --> 00:48:27,467
I can't lose them.

511
00:49:12,146 --> 00:49:14,646
<i>I understand he took you
by surprise.</i>

512
00:49:14,648 --> 00:49:20,718
<i>What I don't understand is why I'm not
blowing your fool heads off right now.</i>

513
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:23,521
His ship was as big as a 747.

514
00:49:23,523 --> 00:49:26,124
Your satellite's must've
picked him up.

515
00:49:26,126 --> 00:49:28,093
<i>Savage uses a cloaking device.</i>

516
00:49:28,095 --> 00:49:30,062
<i>He could hide the moon
if he wanted to.</i>

517
00:49:30,064 --> 00:49:32,398
He must've left
some kind of trail.

518
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,733
A heat signature?
A disruption in the clouds?

519
00:49:34,735 --> 00:49:36,767
<i>You better hope
we find something.</i>

520
00:49:36,769 --> 00:49:40,437
<i>Otherwise, this camping trip
is over.</i>

521
00:49:40,439 --> 00:49:42,340
<i>Waller out.</i>

522
00:49:42,342 --> 00:49:45,343
Oh, Benji gets a star.

523
00:49:45,345 --> 00:49:47,077
We should've kept on fighting.

524
00:49:47,079 --> 00:49:49,383
At least one of us would've
gotten out with a card.

525
00:49:50,416 --> 00:49:52,216
Hey, where you going?

526
00:49:52,218 --> 00:49:53,651
I need to get some air.

527
00:49:53,653 --> 00:49:55,655
Well, who's gonna lead us?

528
00:49:56,523 --> 00:49:58,059
You're incharge.

529
00:50:04,564 --> 00:50:06,734
Who wants pizza?

530
00:50:36,564 --> 00:50:38,463
It's okay.

531
00:50:38,465 --> 00:50:39,900
I'm looking for Zoe.

532
00:50:40,599 --> 00:50:42,434
Are you her dad?

533
00:50:42,436 --> 00:50:43,738
Yeah.

534
00:50:45,506 --> 00:50:47,008
Where are you guns?

535
00:50:52,246 --> 00:50:54,713
Cool. A lot of .45s right?

536
00:50:54,715 --> 00:50:57,015
I play a lot of
first person shooters.

537
00:50:57,017 --> 00:50:59,086
I'm PussycatKill
on <i>Blood World.</i>

538
00:51:01,188 --> 00:51:02,854
Why isn't she here?

539
00:51:02,856 --> 00:51:04,624
She stays away a lot.

540
00:51:05,459 --> 00:51:07,227
Crap. You got any?

541
00:51:08,327 --> 00:51:09,894
Where'd she go?

542
00:51:09,896 --> 00:51:12,796
Southside on King street,
There's a drug house.

543
00:51:12,798 --> 00:51:14,534
She usually ends up there.

544
00:51:16,068 --> 00:51:18,635
Don't get me wrong.
She's no tweaker.

545
00:51:18,637 --> 00:51:20,606
Maybe some weed.

546
00:51:20,608 --> 00:51:24,441
Speaking of, might as well
wake and bake since I'm up.

547
00:51:24,443 --> 00:51:26,211
She says she's like you.

548
00:51:26,213 --> 00:51:28,082
Likes to live dangerously.

549
00:51:29,383 --> 00:51:32,184
But she kind of hates you too.

550
00:51:32,186 --> 00:51:35,189
I asked my therapist about it,
but he was already asleep.

551
00:51:36,289 --> 00:51:37,525
Want some?

552
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:40,595
More for me.

553
00:52:14,227 --> 00:52:16,162
Seen her around here lately?

554
00:52:17,197 --> 00:52:18,829
Sorry.

555
00:52:18,831 --> 00:52:20,765
You lonely, darling?

556
00:52:20,767 --> 00:52:22,869
No, thanks,
I'm just looking for...

557
00:52:23,803 --> 00:52:26,640
Zoe?

558
00:52:32,311 --> 00:52:35,549
Hey, hey, hey.
What's your hurry, buddy?

559
00:52:37,385 --> 00:52:39,952
Tough guy, huh? He got any cash?

560
00:52:39,954 --> 00:52:43,557
Look, you dickless wonders,
I don't have time for this.

561
00:52:46,626 --> 00:52:48,662
You're in trouble, deadbeat.

562
00:52:49,896 --> 00:52:51,998
You shut off your comm lines.

563
00:52:57,470 --> 00:52:59,306
Your kid's not on mission.

564
00:53:00,374 --> 00:53:02,041
You don't understand.

565
00:53:02,043 --> 00:53:04,843
You think you're the only one
who's lost someone?

566
00:53:04,845 --> 00:53:06,812
Remember
the League of Assassins?

567
00:53:06,814 --> 00:53:09,680
You worked for 'em
once or twice.

568
00:53:09,682 --> 00:53:12,285
Once. Lousy benefits.

569
00:53:16,256 --> 00:53:19,224
Went undercover and
infiltrated them the agency.

570
00:53:19,226 --> 00:53:22,026
They found out,
they tried to kill me,

571
00:53:22,028 --> 00:53:24,064
but that's easier said
than done.

572
00:53:25,064 --> 00:53:27,635
<i>So they went after my fiance.</i>

573
00:53:32,106 --> 00:53:36,341
<i>I tracked down and killed
as many of them I could.</i>

574
00:53:36,343 --> 00:53:39,644
<i>Including a few moles
working for us.</i>

575
00:53:39,646 --> 00:53:44,986
I didn't know, but to tell you
the truth, I didn't care.

576
00:53:45,718 --> 00:53:47,820
This story have a point?

577
00:53:47,822 --> 00:53:51,622
Don't make me feel sorry for
you and your rathole existence.

578
00:53:51,624 --> 00:53:55,394
I did everything in God's power
to protect the woman I loved.

579
00:53:55,396 --> 00:53:57,999
But you, you threw
your daughter away.

580
00:54:16,584 --> 00:54:17,852
Shit.

581
00:54:36,970 --> 00:54:38,805
I was holding back
because of your kid,

582
00:54:40,508 --> 00:54:42,109
but now I'm gonna finish this.

583
00:54:44,778 --> 00:54:46,912
Deadshot, you gotta
call the Wall.

584
00:54:46,914 --> 00:54:49,680
She went nuts when
she found out I was incharge.

585
00:54:49,682 --> 00:54:53,417
I says to her, "So how's a girl
supposed to get ahead in this outfit?"

586
00:54:53,419 --> 00:54:56,057
And that's when she got
really pissed off.

587
00:54:56,590 --> 00:54:57,925
Shall we?

588
00:55:00,626 --> 00:55:01,961
It's not her.

589
00:55:13,539 --> 00:55:16,039
I'm here.

590
00:55:16,041 --> 00:55:18,809
<i>You're one lucky guy, Lawton.</i>

591
00:55:18,811 --> 00:55:23,284
<i>You don't know how close you came
to an out-of-body experience.</i>

592
00:55:24,050 --> 00:55:27,084
I took a side trip. So what?

593
00:55:27,086 --> 00:55:28,822
Tiger's incharge.

594
00:55:30,624 --> 00:55:31,826
You heard the woman.

595
00:55:32,526 --> 00:55:33,761
Drive.

596
00:55:49,409 --> 00:55:51,910
Waller wants us to keep going
north for the time being.

597
00:55:51,912 --> 00:55:55,916
We'll take a rest stop here
and reconvene at 1700 hours.

598
00:55:58,617 --> 00:55:59,919
Five o' clock.

599
00:56:01,387 --> 00:56:02,389
Oh!

600
00:56:08,861 --> 00:56:10,965
I think grumpy's staying.

601
00:56:12,131 --> 00:56:14,001
Are you stayin' grumpy?

602
00:56:16,168 --> 00:56:18,338
Yep, grumpy's staying.

603
00:56:22,343 --> 00:56:25,010
I'm gonna order some food.
What do you want?

604
00:56:25,012 --> 00:56:27,214
Anything but chicken nuggies.

605
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:29,784
I'm going to the can.

606
00:56:31,718 --> 00:56:33,954
I bet she pees icicles.

607
00:56:49,135 --> 00:56:50,403
Hmm.

608
00:56:57,510 --> 00:56:59,278
Who is this?

609
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:01,613
<i>Listen clsoe, 'cause
I'm only gonna say this once.</i>

610
00:57:01,615 --> 00:57:06,153
32.1 degrees north,
minus 112 degrees east.

611
00:58:03,543 --> 00:58:04,878
What the hell?

612
00:58:07,146 --> 00:58:10,115
- And no onions.
<i>- Tiger.</i>

613
00:58:10,117 --> 00:58:12,584
- <i>They got Frost.</i>
- What?

614
00:58:12,586 --> 00:58:13,988
I'm goin' after them.

615
00:59:55,188 --> 00:59:57,057
<i>Hope you're doing all right.</i>

616
00:59:59,392 --> 01:00:01,892
Sorry if Banshee
got a little rough.

617
01:00:01,894 --> 01:00:03,394
She feels terrible.

618
01:00:03,396 --> 01:00:06,766
Yeah, I'm all up in
my feelings about it.

619
01:00:10,104 --> 01:00:12,736
Honestly, we meant you no harm.

620
01:00:12,738 --> 01:00:14,173
We just want to talk.

621
01:00:15,742 --> 01:00:19,044
Fact is, I'm a fan.

622
01:00:19,046 --> 01:00:23,481
I mean, this gift you have,
it's really quite extraordinary.

623
01:00:23,483 --> 01:00:26,486
I don't think people realize
what you're capable of doing.

624
01:00:27,486 --> 01:00:29,155
What's this about?

625
01:00:31,124 --> 01:00:33,457
Its about a favor.

626
01:00:33,459 --> 01:00:35,760
Everyone needs a favor
once in a while.

627
01:00:35,762 --> 01:00:38,296
Banshee here would like me
to help her go back in time

628
01:00:38,298 --> 01:00:41,099
to seek vengeance against
the clan who banished her.

629
01:00:41,101 --> 01:00:42,401
That bastards!

630
01:00:42,403 --> 01:00:45,736
Blockbuster, uncomplicated
fellow that he is

631
01:00:45,738 --> 01:00:47,671
would like his own island.

632
01:00:50,175 --> 01:00:53,044
Me? I want the card.

633
01:00:53,046 --> 01:00:56,183
Waller can trace me, you know?
She'll be sending them.

634
01:00:57,117 --> 01:00:59,720
What if I can make all that
go away?

635
01:01:00,854 --> 01:01:02,653
And what do you get out of it?

636
01:01:02,655 --> 01:01:06,293
Like I said a favor.
One hand washing the other.

637
01:01:08,561 --> 01:01:10,894
It has to do with
Professor Pyg, I...

638
01:01:10,896 --> 01:01:13,497
I think I finally understand
how he fits in.

639
01:01:13,499 --> 01:01:18,405
And for you, it would take no more effort
than freezing a tray of ice cubes.

640
01:01:20,139 --> 01:01:21,541
I'm listening.

641
01:01:26,144 --> 01:01:27,413
Don't move.

642
01:01:46,867 --> 01:01:48,765
Sorry.

643
01:01:48,767 --> 01:01:50,236
Just a cramp.

644
01:01:56,441 --> 01:01:58,475
<i>I'm telling you,
nothing's moving inside.</i>

645
01:01:58,477 --> 01:02:00,380
Not even the dust and the air.

646
01:02:02,514 --> 01:02:04,250
She's in there, all right.

647
01:02:05,418 --> 01:02:07,318
I want to set up a perimeter.

648
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:09,553
Boomerang, you take
the north side.

649
01:02:09,555 --> 01:02:12,157
Harley. Where's Harley?

650
01:02:14,193 --> 01:02:17,162
We're coming to get you, Frosty!

651
01:02:17,164 --> 01:02:19,564
Shit.

652
01:02:19,566 --> 01:02:21,932
How's our leadership
thing going?

653
01:02:29,508 --> 01:02:31,844
You sure you got
the right address?

654
01:02:33,479 --> 01:02:37,013
She's in there somewhere.
Zoom may have turned her.

655
01:02:37,015 --> 01:02:39,919
I'll give you 30 seconds,
then I'm done with her.

656
01:02:41,421 --> 01:02:44,424
Look around.
Copperhead, under the house.

657
01:02:53,133 --> 01:02:54,465
Really?

658
01:02:54,467 --> 01:02:57,401
Well, she is like
Frosty the snowman.

659
01:02:57,403 --> 01:03:00,240
Maybe she melted.

660
01:03:16,389 --> 01:03:18,390
Something's off.
We're being set up.

661
01:03:18,392 --> 01:03:20,527
Tell Waller we found her.
Buy her some time.

662
01:03:21,695 --> 01:03:24,497
<i>We think we got
Frost, Waller. Standby.</i>

663
01:03:26,432 --> 01:03:27,901
She's done.

664
01:03:35,874 --> 01:03:37,610
<i>The bomb, it's down here.</i>

665
01:03:38,311 --> 01:03:39,513
Everybody out.

666
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:03,236
I don't think he looks so good.

667
01:04:16,148 --> 01:04:20,686
Poor Tiger, just when I was
starting to get interested.

668
01:04:23,122 --> 01:04:27,492
<i>Lawton, we just got satellite
photos on those coordinates you gave me.</i>

669
01:04:27,494 --> 01:04:32,062
<i>This canyon shortcut will get
you to Savage ahead of Zoom.</i>

670
01:04:32,064 --> 01:04:35,166
<i>I'm enroute, but it might
take a while.</i>

671
01:04:35,168 --> 01:04:37,968
There wouldn't be a hospital
on the way, would there?

672
01:04:37,970 --> 01:04:39,303
Or a mortuary.

673
01:04:39,305 --> 01:04:41,472
<i>He's a soldier, Lawton.</i>

674
01:04:41,474 --> 01:04:43,675
<i>Dying's an occupational hazard.</i>

675
01:04:43,677 --> 01:04:48,747
<i>Keep your eyes on the road
and your head on the mission.</i>

676
01:04:48,749 --> 01:04:53,283
Why so glum, mate? You got
your job back, didn't ya?

677
01:04:53,285 --> 01:04:56,254
That bloody fool. Our true-blue.

678
01:04:56,256 --> 01:04:58,254
So freaking noble.

679
01:04:58,256 --> 01:05:00,992
Never got that we're just a puppets
trying to get through the show

680
01:05:00,994 --> 01:05:02,595
with our strings attached.

681
01:05:17,010 --> 01:05:19,010
<i>It's quite
a crib Vandal's got.</i>

682
01:05:19,012 --> 01:05:21,548
All that's missing is a sign
that says "Bad guy lives here."

683
01:05:28,921 --> 01:05:30,090
Come on.

684
01:05:49,976 --> 01:05:53,711
How's that?
Mighty beauty, I'd say.

685
01:05:53,713 --> 01:05:56,582
Let's not give each other
handjobs just yet.

686
01:06:00,253 --> 01:06:01,988
You see a way to get inside?

687
01:06:17,736 --> 01:06:19,539
I think we're being summoned.

688
01:06:32,151 --> 01:06:33,517
Poor Piggy.

689
01:06:33,519 --> 01:06:35,919
<i>Looks like he went to market.</i>

690
01:06:35,921 --> 01:06:38,758
This is a warning.
I'd say it's working.

691
01:06:56,575 --> 01:06:59,478
I presume my grieving
daughter sent you.

692
01:07:03,381 --> 01:07:04,914
Children.

693
01:07:04,916 --> 01:07:06,984
I must've sired
a hundred thousand.

694
01:07:06,986 --> 01:07:10,155
You think one would
show me some respect.

695
01:07:10,157 --> 01:07:14,628
If you wanna live another century
or two, hand over the card.

696
01:07:16,762 --> 01:07:19,296
That would be impossible.

697
01:07:19,298 --> 01:07:22,533
Mate, he's gotta have it. Doesn't
work if you don't have it on you.

698
01:07:22,535 --> 01:07:23,803
Not on me.

699
01:07:26,206 --> 01:07:27,441
In me.

700
01:07:28,474 --> 01:07:29,843
Professor Pyg.

701
01:07:34,447 --> 01:07:35,879
I don't get it.

702
01:07:35,881 --> 01:07:39,149
He had Pyg implant
the card in him.

703
01:07:39,151 --> 01:07:44,021
In such a position that to
remove it would kill me.

704
01:07:44,023 --> 01:07:47,892
Why do you even need it? You're
supposed to live for bloody ever.

705
01:07:47,894 --> 01:07:51,861
I'm immortal, not invulnerable.

706
01:07:51,863 --> 01:07:55,432
I've had more brushes with death
in the last ten years

707
01:07:55,434 --> 01:07:57,667
than all
the centuries preceding

708
01:07:57,669 --> 01:08:00,106
thanks to the emergence
of meta humans.

709
01:08:02,275 --> 01:08:04,043
I'm afraid no one lives forever.

710
01:08:08,814 --> 01:08:11,649
It's a neurosynaptic discharge.

711
01:08:11,651 --> 01:08:15,119
Blocks sensory motor
functions pretty quickly.

712
01:08:15,121 --> 01:08:18,090
That is, if you can
still hear me.

713
01:08:43,450 --> 01:08:44,918
That's a hell of an entrance.

714
01:08:50,956 --> 01:08:53,391
Frosty, you got the wrong side.

715
01:08:53,393 --> 01:08:56,459
We're the good bad guys...

716
01:08:56,461 --> 01:08:59,633
God, I've been wanting
to do that for a week now.

717
01:09:06,738 --> 01:09:09,073
Such a quick healer.

718
01:09:09,075 --> 01:09:11,577
You and I have that in common.

719
01:09:12,711 --> 01:09:14,813
Our little favor, Miss Frost?

720
01:09:16,549 --> 01:09:17,884
<i>Lawton.</i>

721
01:09:20,152 --> 01:09:23,287
We should be there at 0200 hours.
You have it yet?

722
01:09:23,289 --> 01:09:24,691
Getting there.

723
01:09:27,927 --> 01:09:29,563
Why are they freezing him?

724
01:09:30,329 --> 01:09:31,662
Not quite.

725
01:09:31,664 --> 01:09:33,631
Just bringing down
his body temperature

726
01:09:33,633 --> 01:09:35,635
to the point where
we can work with him.

727
01:09:37,536 --> 01:09:40,738
You're slow, Zoom, in the old
days, you never needed help.

728
01:09:40,740 --> 01:09:42,075
What's the problem?

729
01:09:46,946 --> 01:09:48,915
You might say everything.

730
01:09:56,121 --> 01:09:57,555
Nice shot.

731
01:09:57,557 --> 01:09:59,159
It was Batman.

732
01:10:00,226 --> 01:10:01,695
In another timeline.

733
01:10:03,429 --> 01:10:05,128
Can't say that I blame him.

734
01:10:05,130 --> 01:10:08,532
Thanks to me, his entire world
was going to die.

735
01:10:08,534 --> 01:10:13,740
Only Flash could turn back time and I was
damned if I was gonna let that happen.

736
01:10:14,639 --> 01:10:16,642
I never saw it coming.

737
01:10:19,211 --> 01:10:20,977
<i>But I felt it.</i>

738
01:10:20,979 --> 01:10:23,114
<i>I tried to vibrate
my inner molecules</i>

739
01:10:23,116 --> 01:10:27,083
<i>to save my brain even as
the bullet was tearing through.</i>

740
01:10:27,085 --> 01:10:31,587
<i>And in that moment, that very
infinitesimal split-second before death,</i>

741
01:10:31,589 --> 01:10:35,659
<i>I drew the Speed Force into me with
every ounce of will power I had left.</i>

742
01:10:35,661 --> 01:10:42,865
<i>And literally by time, I'd expanded my
moment of dying into day, maybe weeks.</i>

743
01:10:42,867 --> 01:10:45,368
But it's like operating
in a fog.

744
01:10:45,370 --> 01:10:48,773
Everything's a little unreal
and warped.

745
01:10:48,775 --> 01:10:51,374
I feel like I'm walking
through water sometimes.

746
01:10:51,376 --> 01:10:55,878
And then when I speed up, I can
feel my life slipping away.

747
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:57,416
He's ready.

748
01:11:04,022 --> 01:11:06,257
I'm running on fumes now.

749
01:11:06,259 --> 01:11:09,696
But I've got just enough
gas left for this.

750
01:11:44,830 --> 01:11:46,900
Bon voyage, caveman.

751
01:11:58,812 --> 01:12:01,678
Shall we send Savage
some company, Banshee?

752
01:12:20,866 --> 01:12:25,337
You were right, speedy, nobody
knows what I'm capable of.

753
01:12:41,054 --> 01:12:43,523
Why, thanks. Don't mind if I do.

754
01:12:45,924 --> 01:12:48,993
I don't suppose you're
coming back to the fold?

755
01:12:48,995 --> 01:12:51,595
You supposed right, deadhead.

756
01:12:51,597 --> 01:12:53,230
The neck is clear.

757
01:12:53,232 --> 01:12:55,966
<i>And I got the card.</i>

758
01:12:55,968 --> 01:12:58,935
<i>Membership does have
its privileges after all.</i>

759
01:12:58,937 --> 01:13:01,071
Oh, really?

760
01:13:01,073 --> 01:13:02,638
I didn't think
you were a believer.

761
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:05,409
I'm not, but a girl's
gotta make some money.

762
01:13:05,411 --> 01:13:07,444
How do I put
this up for auction?

763
01:13:07,446 --> 01:13:10,247
Let Waller know
I'll give her the first bid.

764
01:13:10,249 --> 01:13:14,187
You tell that trick bitch
her ass is mine, you hear?

765
01:13:15,821 --> 01:13:18,922
Yeah, I think she got it.

766
01:13:18,924 --> 01:13:20,526
<i>So long, suckers.</i>

767
01:13:57,863 --> 01:13:59,462
Okay.

768
01:13:59,464 --> 01:14:01,867
Let's see how cold-blooded
you can get.

769
01:14:04,437 --> 01:14:07,003
Where's the car?
How close are they doing?

770
01:14:07,005 --> 01:14:09,308
Coopehead's got her,
but not for long.

771
01:14:24,389 --> 01:14:27,960
Waller, I'll see you in hell,
you dirty...

772
01:14:47,879 --> 01:14:49,414
Son of a bitch.

773
01:14:51,317 --> 01:14:53,920
How about helping
old Digger out here, eh?

774
01:14:54,620 --> 01:14:56,289
Hey, hey. Whoa, hey.

775
01:15:00,893 --> 01:15:02,592
Two dead, Waller.

776
01:15:02,594 --> 01:15:05,397
<i>I'll live with it.
Just get me the card.</i>

777
01:15:10,669 --> 01:15:13,106
All for a magic trick.

778
01:15:16,976 --> 01:15:19,510
Oh, ye of little faith.

779
01:15:19,512 --> 01:15:22,078
She'll blow you head off,
too, you know?

780
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:24,017
You're still not
getting it, love.

781
01:15:25,151 --> 01:15:26,316
I got the card.

782
01:15:26,318 --> 01:15:28,017
No onne's gonna kill me

783
01:15:28,019 --> 01:15:30,490
and waste a pass to the
pearly gates on this tosser.

784
01:15:48,808 --> 01:15:52,376
Benji! Oh, I thought
you were toast, mate.

785
01:15:52,378 --> 01:15:53,977
You okay?

786
01:15:53,979 --> 01:15:55,912
Where are the others?

787
01:15:55,914 --> 01:15:57,580
Oh, dead.

788
01:15:57,582 --> 01:16:00,751
They all killed each other
like cats in a bag.

789
01:16:00,753 --> 01:16:03,720
Savage, Zoom, all of them.

790
01:16:03,722 --> 01:16:05,189
What about the card?

791
01:16:05,191 --> 01:16:06,623
Well, mate, who knows?

792
01:16:06,625 --> 01:16:08,628
Waller's got to bring
a cleaning crew for that.

793
01:16:09,695 --> 01:16:10,996
Even for scum,

794
01:16:11,997 --> 01:16:14,431
you make a lousy liar.

795
01:16:14,433 --> 01:16:17,403
Watch it, kitten, you're not
the only one with claws.

796
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:31,117
I know you have it.
Give it to me!

797
01:16:34,052 --> 01:16:35,621
Screw you.

798
01:16:37,022 --> 01:16:39,222
Cowboy, Zoom just took off.

799
01:16:39,224 --> 01:16:42,258
- Oh, yeah.
- No, you stay.

800
01:16:42,260 --> 01:16:43,763
Make sure they don't leave.

801
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:50,103
Goddamn it.

802
01:17:06,552 --> 01:17:10,223
Either your reflexes are back
or mine are short.

803
01:17:13,825 --> 01:17:15,128
Hmm.

804
01:17:16,495 --> 01:17:18,664
I'd say this more than
evens things.

805
01:17:23,068 --> 01:17:26,035
Drop the card and walk away.

806
01:17:26,037 --> 01:17:28,905
What are you gonna do?
Kill me?

807
01:17:28,907 --> 01:17:31,341
Death by a thousand cuts, Tiger.

808
01:17:31,343 --> 01:17:33,312
I'll have that card
by number ten.

809
01:18:11,015 --> 01:18:12,585
Did I say ten?

810
01:18:19,290 --> 01:18:21,193
I underestimated.

811
01:18:36,909 --> 01:18:39,644
Do it. Save me the trouble.

812
01:18:40,612 --> 01:18:43,145
Maybe I'll just ward you too.

813
01:18:43,147 --> 01:18:48,784
I promise you, Deadshot, I'm
good for one last hit of speed.

814
01:18:48,786 --> 01:18:51,691
Any bullet you shoot,
I'll make sure it's lethal.

815
01:18:52,691 --> 01:18:54,160
So go ahead.

816
01:18:54,893 --> 01:18:56,628
Make my afterlife.

817
01:19:14,713 --> 01:19:16,715
Fuck my life.

818
01:19:46,711 --> 01:19:47,847
Kill me.

819
01:19:49,048 --> 01:19:51,047
We got him.

820
01:19:51,049 --> 01:19:52,918
We just crossed the finish line.

821
01:20:00,492 --> 01:20:02,195
I can't save you.

822
01:20:02,894 --> 01:20:04,296
I'm beyond

823
01:20:05,330 --> 01:20:06,698
salvation.

824
01:20:24,950 --> 01:20:27,687
You didn't want her
to have it either.

825
01:20:29,655 --> 01:20:31,590
She doesn't deserve it.

826
01:20:32,790 --> 01:20:35,660
What was her name? Your fiance?

827
01:20:37,662 --> 01:20:38,930
Miyoshi.

828
01:20:40,366 --> 01:20:41,834
Pretty name.

829
01:21:04,924 --> 01:21:07,660
Uh, I'll be damned.

830
01:21:11,796 --> 01:21:14,433
You better have that
freaking card.

831
01:21:21,205 --> 01:21:22,775
Not a scratch on it.

832
01:21:27,979 --> 01:21:30,549
Hmm, it feels cold.

833
01:21:31,383 --> 01:21:32,785
It's a cold world.

834
01:21:33,684 --> 01:21:35,918
This Zoom guy, he disappeared.

835
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:39,588
I looked around...
Oh, hi, Wally, how's Trix?

836
01:21:39,590 --> 01:21:41,824
She would live.

837
01:21:43,696 --> 01:21:45,194
Are we good?

838
01:21:45,196 --> 01:21:48,967
No one's ever to speak
of this, Lawton, understood?

839
01:21:51,469 --> 01:21:53,338
I'll be seeing you, Waller.

840
01:21:55,307 --> 01:21:56,809
<i>Maybe in heaven.</i>
