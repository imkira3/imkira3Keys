3
00:01:09,468 --> 00:01:11,304
Hm?

4
00:01:24,616 --> 00:01:26,483
Let's go.

5
00:01:26,485 --> 00:01:28,585
<i>So what are we doing here?</i>

6
00:01:28,587 --> 00:01:30,087
<i>Well, my grandfather
used to tell me,</i>

7
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:31,888
<i>the future can give you
anything you want.</i>

8
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:33,590
Come on. What are you doing?

9
00:01:33,592 --> 00:01:35,226
What are you doing?

10
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:38,795
<i>If we wait long enough,
the future will create it.</i>

11
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:41,798
<i>Maybe through technology,</i>

12
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,136
<i>or maybe just from making you
not want it anymore.</i>

13
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:48,342
<i>Either way, the answer
is in the future.</i>

14
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,715
What's wrong, Boss? Come on.

15
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,585
You wanna go back
to obedience school?

16
00:02:02,621 --> 00:02:03,622
Yeah.

17
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:05,658
I didn't think so.

18
00:02:18,604 --> 00:02:19,840
What's in it, Boss?

19
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:43,864
Oh.

20
00:02:57,609 --> 00:02:58,942
Boss!

21
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,922
Hello?

22
00:03:11,056 --> 00:03:12,255
Hello...

23
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:16,029
Boss, let's go.

24
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:19,630
Jackie.

25
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:21,298
- Professor Hopper here.
- <i>Hey!</i>

26
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,166
<i>You didn't get shot
by any hunters. Awesome.</i>

27
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:24,267
So I found the van.

28
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:25,702
No sign of the hippies. Uh...

29
00:03:25,704 --> 00:03:27,271
Listen, I need you to put
a climbing pack together for me.

30
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:29,974
- <i>Oh, really?</i>
- But you can't tell Taylor.

31
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:31,642
If he finds out
I'm doing an expedition

32
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:33,344
without him, he'll get upset.

33
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:34,644
It's better this way.

34
00:03:34,646 --> 00:03:36,814
<i>Do you want her
to have, like,</i>

35
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:39,049
10,000 of your babies?

36
00:03:39,051 --> 00:03:40,718
It's like you're 13.

37
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,986
- Yeah.
- Just shut your mouth.

38
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:43,854
You shut your mouth...

39
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:47,591
Tay-Tay. Best friend, buddy.

40
00:03:47,593 --> 00:03:48,759
Pal...

41
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:50,727
Oh, hi, Jackie.

42
00:03:50,729 --> 00:03:52,662
And... Taylor.

43
00:03:52,664 --> 00:03:53,964
Did he really say
not to tell me?

44
00:03:53,966 --> 00:03:55,465
Mm-hmm.

45
00:03:55,467 --> 00:03:56,534
Hey, the whole point
of the favor was discretion.

46
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:58,868
- Come on, Boss. Come on.
- Here, Boss.

47
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:00,203
Sorry.

48
00:04:00,205 --> 00:04:02,974
I had a teeny-tiny car issue
so Taylor had to drive.

49
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:04,308
Besides, he wanted to help.

50
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,509
So you saw it?

51
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:08,812
You saw the van?
When do we go?

52
00:04:08,814 --> 00:04:11,615
I appreciate you setting
this up on such short notice...

53
00:04:11,617 --> 00:04:13,718
- No problemo.
- I appreciate your offer.

54
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,953
Taylor did all the hard work.

55
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:18,788
Situation's changed.
I'm going alone.

56
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,323
- All righty.
- Who's gonna watch your back?

57
00:04:20,325 --> 00:04:21,626
Boss, of course.

58
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:22,794
I'm serious.

59
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:23,994
Nobody's been on this land
in decades.

60
00:04:23,996 --> 00:04:25,028
You guys don't have anything
to worry about.

61
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:27,665
- It's gonna be fine.
- Perfect.

62
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:29,035
Then we'll be back
in no time, right?

63
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:31,367
I'm going alone.

64
00:04:31,369 --> 00:04:34,939
You guys will be fine without me
for a couple of days. Okay?

65
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,273
If you're worried
about your evaluations,

66
00:04:36,275 --> 00:04:39,143
which you should be,
they've already been submitted.

67
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:40,645
And they're glowing.

68
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:42,980
If you can believe that.
Even yours.

69
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:44,917
Oh, look! Twinsies.

70
00:04:46,785 --> 00:04:48,419
Okay, great. Thanks.

71
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:49,920
Gotta get up early.

72
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:50,987
You really think
you're gonna find them?

73
00:04:50,989 --> 00:04:52,922
Maybe.
But if I really get lucky,

74
00:04:52,924 --> 00:04:54,960
I might just find
what they were looking for.

75
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:57,563
Come on, Boss.

76
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,117
It's not plan A.

77
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:21,655
It's just in case.

78
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:27,023
God, you're such a worrywart.

79
00:05:38,003 --> 00:05:40,170
You're just gonna
hold down the fort, huh?

80
00:05:40,172 --> 00:05:42,174
Great.

81
00:05:48,013 --> 00:05:49,848
You're still there, huh?

82
00:06:29,888 --> 00:06:31,090
Moisture?

83
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:42,902
It's a wall.

84
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,681
<i>Jackie, come on.
Wake up.</i>

85
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:58,184
Come on, Jackie!

86
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,852
Uh, hi, good morning.

87
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:03,052
We still have to go.

88
00:07:03,054 --> 00:07:03,787
Even if we have to get
a ride to the gate

89
00:07:03,789 --> 00:07:04,888
and hike for a few days.

90
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:07,391
No. We are not hiking
for a few days.

91
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:09,559
There's no signal within, like,
a hundred miles of that place.

92
00:07:09,561 --> 00:07:11,996
How would anybody know
when to pick us up?

93
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:13,064
You've gotta know somebody

94
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:14,999
who would let us borrow
their truck.

95
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:16,066
Somebody...

96
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:17,501
- Anybody...
- What are you doing

97
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,768
- with my phone?
- Nope.

98
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,270
- I'm not calling her.
- Name one other person

99
00:07:20,272 --> 00:07:22,540
who has an off-road vehicle
who would bend over backwards

100
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:24,208
for you at 6 a.m.
on a Saturday morning.

101
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,809
And it's not her vehicle.

102
00:07:25,811 --> 00:07:27,177
It's her dad's jeep.

103
00:07:27,179 --> 00:07:29,112
And there's no way that
she's gonna loan it out to us.

104
00:07:29,114 --> 00:07:30,181
We'll just rent a truck,
it's fine.

105
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:32,081
- No. We don't have enough time.
- No.

106
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:33,217
- Cara?
- Hang up the...

107
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:34,417
Hey, this is Jackie,

108
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:35,485
Taylor's friend
from the archeology program.

109
00:07:35,487 --> 00:07:36,586
Say goodbye.

110
00:07:36,588 --> 00:07:40,057
I am great,
thank you for asking.

111
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:42,992
Look, Taylor has something
he wants to ask you about.

112
00:07:42,994 --> 00:07:44,160
Come on. Take it.

113
00:07:44,162 --> 00:07:47,066
Sorry, did we wake you up?

114
00:07:49,301 --> 00:07:52,235
- You're doing what?
- What?

115
00:07:52,237 --> 00:07:53,838
What is she doing?

116
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,006
What if I had another option

117
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:56,206
for you that was
a little more adventurous,

118
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:57,508
that would definitely
give Veeves an A?

119
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,609
The only thing is,
you really need to bring by

120
00:07:59,611 --> 00:08:01,011
your dad's sweet-ass
four by four.

121
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:02,112
Awesome.

122
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:03,480
I'll text you
Jackie's address and...

123
00:08:03,482 --> 00:08:06,119
come by like, ASAP,
and we'll explain on the way.

124
00:08:08,186 --> 00:08:09,252
Veeves...

125
00:08:09,254 --> 00:08:10,987
Mm-hmm. Cara's half-sister.

126
00:08:10,989 --> 00:08:12,088
Actually, how are you with kids?

127
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:13,924
Uh... awesome.

128
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:15,292
Okay, so I'm gonna leave

129
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:19,028
this disclaimer here,
just in case I get a bad grade.

130
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:20,598
Cara's hijacking
my school project

131
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,198
to help out a guy she likes.

132
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,001
But there's a catch.

133
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,401
Dad just made her take
a refresher course

134
00:08:25,403 --> 00:08:27,003
on how to drive stick.

135
00:08:27,005 --> 00:08:28,338
Let's see how that went.

136
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,140
Okay, Dad. I got it, I got it.

137
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:31,641
- I got it.
- Honey,

138
00:08:31,643 --> 00:08:35,646
treat a manual transmission
like you would a relationship.

139
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:38,048
You gotta give a little
to get a little.

140
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:40,083
Find the balance.

141
00:08:40,085 --> 00:08:41,051
Dad...

142
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:43,187
- What?
- He's just a friend.

143
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:46,155
Okay? And I really don't need
your relationship advice,

144
00:08:46,157 --> 00:08:48,157
- but thank you.
- But he was a four-sport

145
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:50,160
letterman in high school.
He plays Rugby!

146
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:51,294
Do you want me
to give him your number?

147
00:08:51,296 --> 00:08:52,362
'Cause it sounds like
you like him.

148
00:08:52,364 --> 00:08:54,098
Now, would I let you
borrow the jeep

149
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,165
if I didn't like the guy?

150
00:08:56,167 --> 00:08:58,902
Our purpose in recording this
is to show problem-solving

151
00:08:58,904 --> 00:09:00,971
through adverse
and unfamiliar situations.

152
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:03,306
So, what is our adverse
and unfamiliar situation?

153
00:09:03,308 --> 00:09:06,343
Well, Jackie and I,
we're teaching assistants

154
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:07,410
for this really great guy

155
00:09:07,412 --> 00:09:09,313
in this semester
named Professor Hopper.

156
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:11,048
<i>And, uh... he's been obsessed</i>

157
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,683
with finding these hippies
that went missing

158
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:14,285
- back in the '70s.
- Mm-hmm.

159
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:16,120
<i>They were tripping shrooms
or something,</i>

160
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:18,722
<i>and they went off looking
for the Fountain of Youth...</i>

161
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:19,622
- What?
- <i>And they never came home.</i>

162
00:09:19,624 --> 00:09:20,723
The Fountain of Youth? Really?

163
00:09:20,725 --> 00:09:22,425
Look, I'm not asking you guys

164
00:09:22,427 --> 00:09:23,626
to get your hands muddy.

165
00:09:23,628 --> 00:09:24,727
You can stay in the car
when we get there, okay?

166
00:09:24,729 --> 00:09:25,929
Yeah, all right.
Well, when you told me

167
00:09:25,931 --> 00:09:27,964
that you got a plan
to get Veeves an A,

168
00:09:27,966 --> 00:09:28,832
you really
should have elaborated.

169
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:29,934
Wait, we forgot about Furby.

170
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:31,935
- Furby?
- Mm. Is it imperative

171
00:09:31,937 --> 00:09:33,069
that he come?

172
00:09:33,071 --> 00:09:34,170
I don't... He just...

173
00:09:34,172 --> 00:09:36,006
He smells weird
and he always has that

174
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:38,041
cheese puff crust
on his fingernails.

175
00:09:38,043 --> 00:09:39,109
If Wallace is away
from his mother too long,

176
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:41,411
he gets what we call
"anxiety-rhea."

177
00:09:41,413 --> 00:09:43,948
- Mom!
- But he has pills for that.

178
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,149
Do you have
the house phone?

179
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:46,516
I won't be here.
But, you know, just in case.

180
00:09:46,518 --> 00:09:47,718
Great. Um...
we'll have him home by tonight.

181
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,920
- No booze?
- No, ma'am.

182
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,121
- No drugs?
- No, ma'am.

183
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:53,056
No girls?
Absolutely no girls.

184
00:09:53,058 --> 00:09:54,357
I know he's at
that age because...

185
00:09:54,359 --> 00:09:56,359
I walked in on him
the other day, in his room,

186
00:09:56,361 --> 00:09:58,094
without knocking
and you can imagine

187
00:09:58,096 --> 00:09:59,429
what he's doing.

188
00:09:59,431 --> 00:10:00,631
- Yeah, I promise you...
- Let's go.

189
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:02,665
Let's get in it.
Let's get out of here and...

190
00:10:02,667 --> 00:10:03,766
- Perfect.
- Don't do that.

191
00:10:03,768 --> 00:10:05,669
- I love you, Wallace!
- Okay.

192
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:06,940
Love you, Mom.

193
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:17,381
<i>You can clip the cameras
to your bags</i>

194
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:19,049
<i>to keep your hands free.</i>

195
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:21,084
Here you go.
They're Wi-Fi ready.

196
00:10:21,086 --> 00:10:23,053
Password is... "fart party."

197
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:24,357
What?

198
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:28,025
And one for you, my love.

199
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:29,392
Mm-mm,
you gotta earn it.

200
00:10:29,394 --> 00:10:30,426
Ow!

201
00:10:32,297 --> 00:10:33,563
<i>All right, so who wants
to give Furby the rundown?</i>

202
00:10:33,565 --> 00:10:35,933
<i>I don't need an explanation.</i>

203
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:37,467
<i>That's how big
my love is for you.</i>

204
00:10:37,469 --> 00:10:39,102
- <i>Come on, man.</i>
- <i>Thank you, fart party.</i>

205
00:10:39,104 --> 00:10:42,006
<i>We are going
to find the Fountain of Youth.</i>

206
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:43,540
<i>Well, whatever
my baby wants.</i>

207
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:45,007
<i>Just as long as I can show you</i>

208
00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:46,543
<i>the fountain
of Furby afterwards.</i>

209
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:47,511
- <i>Ew!</i>
- <i>Come on, Furby.</i>

210
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:47,579
<i>So gross, dude.</i>

211
00:10:50,181 --> 00:10:52,281
Well, look at that.

212
00:10:52,283 --> 00:10:55,084
It would have been impossible
to find without a satellite map.

213
00:10:55,086 --> 00:10:57,154
Hey, Furby.
You wanna narrate?

214
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,289
The state of decomposition,
seen now on the van,

215
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:00,390
- is evident that...
- Oh, my god.

216
00:11:00,392 --> 00:11:01,857
- Never mind.
- Hey, come on.

217
00:11:01,859 --> 00:11:03,059
- This is gold over here.
- This is definitely it.

218
00:11:03,061 --> 00:11:05,429
- Wow.
- Hey, Jackie. I...

219
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:06,163
brought my projector
if you wanna curl up in there

220
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,765
and watch movies later.

221
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:09,268
Ew, no. Creepy.

222
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:12,906
Jackie.

223
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:15,908
- The Hoppers?
- Yeah.

224
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:19,543
Why didn't he tell us?

225
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:20,810
I don't get it.

226
00:11:20,812 --> 00:11:21,678
It means
that Hopper didn't just go

227
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,045
looking for some random hippies

228
00:11:23,047 --> 00:11:25,549
that got lost trying
to find the Fountain of Youth.

229
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:28,117
He's trying to find
his missing parents.

230
00:11:28,119 --> 00:11:30,386
Guys, we should totally
take a picture for my vlog.

231
00:11:30,388 --> 00:11:31,622
Help me out. Come on, come on.

232
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:33,589
It will be the greatest
profile picture ever.

233
00:11:33,591 --> 00:11:34,960
All righty.

234
00:11:36,428 --> 00:11:37,429
Okay.

235
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:40,064
Everybody say...

236
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:41,165
"Team Hopper."

237
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:42,565
Team Hopper!

238
00:11:42,567 --> 00:11:45,202
Everybody say, "Team Furby!"

239
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,472
- Team Furby!
- Why?

240
00:11:48,106 --> 00:11:50,073
You guys suck.

241
00:11:50,075 --> 00:11:52,141
Furby, come around
and pull this back door open.

242
00:11:52,143 --> 00:11:53,211
Yes, my Queen.

243
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:56,814
Aah!

244
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:58,082
- Sorry.
- Oh, geez.

245
00:11:58,084 --> 00:11:58,949
Where'd you get this kid.

246
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:00,483
Please don't tell my mom I fell.

247
00:12:00,485 --> 00:12:02,185
Are you okay?
What happened?

248
00:12:02,187 --> 00:12:04,288
- I tripped.
- You okay?

249
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,389
I found this.

250
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,357
- What?
- No, just wait. Okay?

251
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:08,424
It might be a booby trap.

252
00:12:08,426 --> 00:12:10,461
Relax. It's not <i>The Goonies.</i>

253
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:11,795
What's <i>The Goonies?</i>

254
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:13,163
- Seriously?
- What?

255
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:14,264
You haven't seen
<i>The Goonies?</i>

256
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:16,366
You kinda do look like Chunk.

257
00:12:17,735 --> 00:12:19,035
- What is that?
- Ladies and gentlemen,

258
00:12:19,037 --> 00:12:20,370
- we have a winner.
- Whoa, is that a cave?

259
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:22,575
Easy, kid.
You're just here to document.

260
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:26,543
Wow.

261
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:28,444
This is huge.

262
00:12:28,446 --> 00:12:29,512
- Firsties!
- No, Veeves.

263
00:12:29,514 --> 00:12:31,550
- Please stay next to me.
- Mm-hmm.

264
00:12:36,321 --> 00:12:39,289
No one said
anything about caves.

265
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,592
Caves have bats and...

266
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,528
and bears, and...

267
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:45,531
monsters...

268
00:12:46,197 --> 00:12:47,199
and...

269
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,767
Spiders!

270
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:52,102
- Hey, hey, hey.
- They're everywhere.

271
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:53,170
- Let me go.
- Hey, they're crickets.

272
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:56,205
Furby.
Take a chill pill, dude.

273
00:12:56,207 --> 00:12:58,474
- Hey, be nice.
- Don't hurt yourself.

274
00:12:58,476 --> 00:13:01,612
Crickets, spiders...

275
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,149
Whatever. They tried to eat me.

276
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,282
Where's Jackie?

277
00:13:06,284 --> 00:13:09,218
I'm over here.
The rope keeps going.

278
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,590
I'm gonna crawl further.

279
00:13:13,158 --> 00:13:15,692
Dude, it goes
over a cliff.

280
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:17,630
Don't go too far.
You complete me.

281
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,236
Wait.

282
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:27,471
It's been severed at the top.

283
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,275
- Hey, clear the rope.
- Go ahead.

284
00:13:30,441 --> 00:13:31,708
Guys,
this room is massive.

285
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,709
We've got our work
cut out for us.

286
00:13:33,711 --> 00:13:36,646
It looks like somebody went down
but they didn't come back up.

287
00:13:36,648 --> 00:13:37,881
Someone cut Hopper's rope?

288
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:39,315
There's no way
this is Hopper's rope.

289
00:13:39,317 --> 00:13:40,352
It's way too old.

290
00:13:41,686 --> 00:13:43,255
How far down does it go?

291
00:13:44,556 --> 00:13:46,490
Um, like...

292
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,723
I can't tell.

293
00:13:47,725 --> 00:13:49,660
It's too deep to see the bottom.

294
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,594
Are there any crickets?

295
00:13:51,596 --> 00:13:52,963
Some, yeah.

296
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:54,264
I'm out.

297
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:56,335
Professor Hopper,
are you down there?

298
00:13:58,369 --> 00:14:00,337
So, we should
probably do a second line

299
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,905
on the descent to play it safe.

300
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:03,176
What does that mean?

301
00:14:04,676 --> 00:14:05,943
All right, stud muffin.

302
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:08,212
You're up here on lookout
until we get back.

303
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:09,679
So, how long are we talking?

304
00:14:09,681 --> 00:14:11,948
Mm, it depends how long
it takes Cara to have a fit.

305
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,750
- Veeves!
- Great.

306
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:14,784
- Wait.
- Okay.

307
00:14:14,786 --> 00:14:16,352
Not to overstep my bounds

308
00:14:16,354 --> 00:14:17,654
but, uh...

309
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:20,591
your girlfriend could be
really annoying sometimes.

310
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:22,593
Cara's not my girlfriend, dude.

311
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:23,961
Uh, she's not?

312
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:26,563
No. Sometimes I don't
even think she's a girl.

313
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:28,598
Oh, she's totally a girl.

314
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,799
Furby,
how about you just shut up?

315
00:14:29,801 --> 00:14:31,671
- She has all the fun parts.
- Furby, shut up!

316
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:36,508
All right.

317
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:39,943
Take this. Just in case.

318
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:42,945
Yeah. Or we can yell.
It's 20 feet away.

319
00:14:42,947 --> 00:14:44,580
We don't know how far
that thing lead.

320
00:14:44,582 --> 00:14:46,482
And yet, you still go.

321
00:14:46,484 --> 00:14:47,684
Yeah.

322
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:49,352
There's trail mix
and water in my duffle

323
00:14:49,354 --> 00:14:50,455
if we're gone too long.

324
00:14:53,524 --> 00:14:55,291
Later, Furb.

325
00:14:55,293 --> 00:14:57,026
I'll miss you.

326
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:02,466
Counting on you, stud.

327
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:04,534
Counting on me for what?

328
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:05,934
Oh, I don't know, dude.

329
00:15:05,936 --> 00:15:08,405
It just sounded nicer than
"Don't screw anything up."

330
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,606
We'll radio you at the bottom.

331
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:12,041
So, what is it?
One chime for "yes,"

332
00:15:12,043 --> 00:15:13,609
two chimes for "no,"
and three chimes

333
00:15:13,611 --> 00:15:15,011
for "I love you?"

334
00:15:15,013 --> 00:15:16,445
Uh...

335
00:15:17,548 --> 00:15:18,747
You really got
to focus here. Okay?

336
00:15:18,749 --> 00:15:19,482
I would have killed
to do this stuff

337
00:15:19,484 --> 00:15:21,785
when I was her age.

338
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:23,786
I'm 13. I've been
rappelling before, so chill.

339
00:15:23,788 --> 00:15:25,554
Yes. But did you have
a safety instructor,

340
00:15:25,556 --> 00:15:26,689
and footholds, and helmets,

341
00:15:26,691 --> 00:15:28,592
and safety cables
in case you fell.

342
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:29,660
Actually, I didn't.

343
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:31,594
And that's what made it
so much fun.

344
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:35,431
- Hey, Jackie. Wait up.
- Relax.

345
00:15:35,433 --> 00:15:37,434
It's gonna be fine.

346
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,702
Jackie knows what she's doing.

347
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:40,569
Let Veeves have some fun
for once.

348
00:15:40,571 --> 00:15:43,475
Or if you want,
I got another harness.

349
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:46,376
You can come with us.

350
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:49,348
You owe me big.
You know that right?

351
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:50,847
Yeah.

352
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:54,684
Hey, be careful.

353
00:15:54,686 --> 00:15:55,720
I got it.

354
00:15:57,322 --> 00:15:58,323
Veeves.

355
00:15:59,691 --> 00:16:01,193
Veeves!

356
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:03,359
It's fine.

357
00:16:03,361 --> 00:16:05,362
They would have yelled up
if there was a problem.

358
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:07,430
- You think?
- Yeah.

359
00:16:07,432 --> 00:16:08,531
She's just being
a little sister

360
00:16:08,533 --> 00:16:10,468
because you're being
a big sister.

361
00:16:17,575 --> 00:16:19,642
Veeves, come on.

362
00:16:19,644 --> 00:16:21,477
- Veeves!
- <i>Veeves.</i>

363
00:16:21,479 --> 00:16:23,380
Hey, shut it, punk.

364
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:24,680
Taylor, Taylor!

365
00:16:24,682 --> 00:16:27,617
You're fine. You're fine.
We're halfway down.

366
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:29,721
I can't believe
I let you talk me into this.

367
00:16:33,725 --> 00:16:35,391
It's crazy.

368
00:16:35,393 --> 00:16:37,461
- It's like damp.
- What?

369
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:38,531
It's weird.

370
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:40,396
You can feel it.

371
00:16:41,966 --> 00:16:43,065
<i>There's like
this invisible boundary,</i>

372
00:16:43,067 --> 00:16:44,769
where the air
completely changes.

373
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:03,482
What the hell?

374
00:18:16,727 --> 00:18:17,729
What?

375
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:19,799
Boss?

376
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:22,501
Boss!

377
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:30,475
Oh, shit.

378
00:18:34,612 --> 00:18:36,448
Boss, someone's here.
We gotta go.

379
00:18:37,882 --> 00:18:40,015
Boss! Come on.

380
00:18:40,017 --> 00:18:41,486
Get in the car, boy.

381
00:18:44,555 --> 00:18:45,790
What the hell?

382
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:00,505
Let's go.

383
00:19:02,006 --> 00:19:03,641
Come on. Come on.

384
00:19:21,025 --> 00:19:22,460
Hello.

385
00:19:24,795 --> 00:19:25,930
I'm unarmed.

386
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:28,667
Please don't shoot me.

387
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,002
I'm from the University
Archeology Department.

388
00:19:33,004 --> 00:19:34,939
I came to explore your cave.

389
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:37,943
My battery has died.

390
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:41,847
I seem to have lost my dog.

391
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:51,655
I'm gonna check your truck
for jumper cables.

392
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:53,626
I'm not here to steal anything.

393
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:59,432
Just maybe your car battery.

394
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,554
Jackie?

395
00:20:24,121 --> 00:20:25,590
Jackie!

396
00:20:29,994 --> 00:20:31,062
Shit.

397
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:46,712
Jackie!

398
00:20:47,612 --> 00:20:49,044
Taylor!

399
00:20:49,046 --> 00:20:50,648
You guys in here?

400
00:20:56,621 --> 00:20:57,689
Hello!

401
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:02,626
I don't remember
eating breakfast this morning.

402
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:04,763
I think I'm having some kind
of an episode.

403
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:07,632
Hello?

404
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:15,907
Oh, wow.

405
00:21:54,178 --> 00:21:55,813
I think I see the bottom.

406
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:00,216
Look who changed her mind.

407
00:22:00,218 --> 00:22:01,551
- Easy on the landing.
- You look like a pro.

408
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:02,754
Glad you could join us.
We were getting lonely.

409
00:22:03,821 --> 00:22:05,021
- Easy...
- Yeah. Well, how about you

410
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:06,222
- answer me when I call you.
- Uh...

411
00:22:06,224 --> 00:22:06,989
I didn't hear anything
and I don't think

412
00:22:06,991 --> 00:22:08,057
Jackie heard anything.

413
00:22:08,059 --> 00:22:09,094
Yeah. Well then,
check your ears.

414
00:22:11,161 --> 00:22:13,730
You're so weird, dude.

415
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:15,999
They're kinda boring.
Let's go explore.

416
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,570
Let's do it.

417
00:22:18,169 --> 00:22:19,604
Adventure time.

418
00:22:20,805 --> 00:22:22,806
So pretty.

419
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:24,206
- I know, right?
- Whoa.

420
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:26,242
Guys, we're gonna go
check out this tunnel.

421
00:22:31,215 --> 00:22:33,849
Hey, Veeves.
Stay close. Come on.

422
00:22:33,851 --> 00:22:36,086
- Stay close, Cara.
- Veeves.

423
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:37,921
Ooh...

424
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:39,191
- Stop.
- What?

425
00:22:40,024 --> 00:22:41,025
It's not me.

426
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,493
Okay, careful. Watch your step.

427
00:22:44,495 --> 00:22:47,731
Here we go.
I wonder how far back that goes.

428
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:50,966
- I wonder...
- It's crazy in there.

429
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:54,005
Did you hear that?

430
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,642
Okay...

431
00:23:06,517 --> 00:23:07,450
Come here.

432
00:23:08,653 --> 00:23:09,386
Oh, my god,
oh, my god, oh, my god.

433
00:23:11,822 --> 00:23:13,822
Guys, what was that?

434
00:23:13,824 --> 00:23:15,026
You guys,
we gotta get out now.

435
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:17,793
No, we didn't come this far
just to leave now,

436
00:23:17,795 --> 00:23:21,097
- because of some weird noises.
- Taylor, seriously?

437
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:22,464
- Yeah, I'm staying.
- Weird noises,

438
00:23:22,466 --> 00:23:23,767
those were screams!

439
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:24,770
Let's go.

440
00:23:26,036 --> 00:23:27,470
Wait.

441
00:23:27,472 --> 00:23:28,704
I'm not leaving without Hopper.

442
00:23:28,706 --> 00:23:30,773
Cara, wait.
I'm the fastest climber.

443
00:23:30,775 --> 00:23:31,974
Furby and I can
pull you two up faster

444
00:23:31,976 --> 00:23:33,542
than you could ever
pull yourselves up.

445
00:23:33,544 --> 00:23:34,610
- She's right.
- Okay?

446
00:23:34,612 --> 00:23:35,712
I'll come back down
once they're up.

447
00:23:35,714 --> 00:23:37,513
- Okay. Uh-huh.
- You ready?

448
00:23:37,515 --> 00:23:39,081
One, two, three.

449
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:51,860
Whoa, no!

450
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:54,864
Jackie!

451
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:56,165
- Jackie!
- What...

452
00:23:57,802 --> 00:23:58,835
What happened, Jackie?

453
00:23:58,837 --> 00:24:00,169
I got it.

454
00:24:02,006 --> 00:24:04,040
Awesome.

455
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:05,276
It's okay, I got it.

456
00:24:10,014 --> 00:24:11,917
What? They cut the rope.

457
00:24:15,986 --> 00:24:17,153
Thank you.

458
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:19,992
Oh, shit.

459
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,028
Furby, I swear to God, man.

460
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,261
- He cut it?
- Geez!

461
00:24:26,263 --> 00:24:27,329
Furby wouldn't cut it!

462
00:24:27,331 --> 00:24:28,498
Furby!

463
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,233
Stop messing around, man.
I swear to God.

464
00:24:31,235 --> 00:24:33,101
Drop us the rope back down,
dumbass.

465
00:24:33,103 --> 00:24:35,039
You almost killed Jackie.

466
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:41,813
Furby?

467
00:24:43,113 --> 00:24:45,016
How'd he do that?

468
00:24:46,217 --> 00:24:47,184
Hey, dude.

469
00:24:47,186 --> 00:24:48,617
- Are you okay up there?
- Shit.

470
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:54,890
Okay, let me just
take it off.

471
00:24:54,892 --> 00:24:57,327
I know Furby since kindergarten,
he wouldn't do this.

472
00:24:58,863 --> 00:25:00,097
What is it?

473
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:02,130
Got caught on Cara's harness
when she fell.

474
00:25:02,132 --> 00:25:03,265
How bad is it?

475
00:25:03,267 --> 00:25:04,600
They feel broken.

476
00:25:06,303 --> 00:25:08,070
Sorry, Hopper.

477
00:25:08,072 --> 00:25:11,074
Looks like your two
best climbers just got benched.

478
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:14,010
- Is yours that bad?
- Yeah.

479
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:16,178
Guys, we have to figure out
an exit plan.

480
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,181
Our exit plan is for Furby
to stop being a dick

481
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:19,482
and throw down another rope.

482
00:25:19,484 --> 00:25:21,584
Yeah, but could you
climb it with that hand?

483
00:25:21,586 --> 00:25:22,885
I don't really have
a choice now, do I?

484
00:25:22,887 --> 00:25:24,620
Cara, you're gonna have
to climb freehand.

485
00:25:24,622 --> 00:25:25,955
What?

486
00:25:25,957 --> 00:25:28,590
No, it's like 90 feet.
If she falls, she's dead.

487
00:25:30,962 --> 00:25:31,964
Um...

488
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:35,801
Give me that radio.

489
00:25:37,167 --> 00:25:38,803
I'm gonna get an A for sure.

490
00:25:40,237 --> 00:25:41,404
Furby...

491
00:25:41,406 --> 00:25:42,871
Stop messing around, man. Okay?

492
00:25:42,873 --> 00:25:44,007
We got something down here
and I need you to throw down

493
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:46,041
the other end of the rope
right now.

494
00:25:49,947 --> 00:25:50,847
Furby?

495
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:52,184
Hit the chime button.

496
00:25:57,088 --> 00:25:59,792
- There's something down there.
- And they have a radio.

497
00:26:02,193 --> 00:26:04,293
Professor Hopper?

498
00:26:04,295 --> 00:26:06,061
This is Taylor, we're here
to get you out of here.

499
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:11,936
<i>Help... me.</i>

500
00:26:13,103 --> 00:26:14,806
- Cara?
- Taylor...

501
00:26:16,373 --> 00:26:17,975
Who is this?

502
00:26:22,246 --> 00:26:23,980
<i>It's me, over...</i>

503
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:26,214
<i>Help... me.</i>

504
00:26:26,216 --> 00:26:29,053
Professor Hopper, is that you?

505
00:26:34,091 --> 00:26:35,191
<i>Furby...</i>

506
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:37,327
What?
Did he just say "Furby"?

507
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:39,298
That doesn't sound like Furby.

508
00:26:41,131 --> 00:26:43,031
Who is this?

509
00:26:43,033 --> 00:26:44,532
Who's on this channel?

510
00:26:44,534 --> 00:26:47,305
<i>Dude... It's Furby.</i>

511
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:52,107
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?

512
00:26:52,109 --> 00:26:53,276
What's it look like I'm doing?

513
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,344
I'll figure out
what the hell is going on.

514
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:56,279
No, you can't go
in there alone.

515
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,114
- Let's go.
- No, no.

516
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,182
You can't go alone.

517
00:26:59,184 --> 00:27:00,649
And you're staying here
with Jackie.

518
00:27:00,651 --> 00:27:04,087
The one person who doesn't stand
a chance to defend herself,

519
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:06,088
I'll take my chances
with you guys, thanks.

520
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:07,257
Are you kidding me? No.

521
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:08,758
If it were Hopper,
he would've said so,

522
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,359
so sit your butt down.
Right now.

523
00:27:10,361 --> 00:27:11,429
Who's gonna stop me?

524
00:27:15,132 --> 00:27:16,732
See? You see now?

525
00:27:16,734 --> 00:27:18,467
Why I didn't wanna bring
a 13-year-old into this cave?

526
00:27:18,469 --> 00:27:19,769
Well, there would've been
no problem,

527
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:21,370
except for her stupid friend
who cut the rope.

528
00:27:21,372 --> 00:27:22,437
He didn't cut the rope.

529
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:27,743
Honey, I think
the class project is over.

530
00:27:27,745 --> 00:27:29,244
This is the kind of thing
only a camera

531
00:27:29,246 --> 00:27:30,413
can prove actually happened,

532
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:32,415
and you don't want to have
a record of it?

533
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:33,715
If she's shining the light,

534
00:27:33,717 --> 00:27:35,286
she might as well be rolling.

535
00:27:38,555 --> 00:27:40,289
Well, we can sit here
and wait forever,

536
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:41,357
or we can do
what we came down here to do

537
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:43,095
and figure out
what's over there.

538
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:48,500
I hate all of you.

539
00:27:57,042 --> 00:27:58,443
Bye, guys. I'll be here.

540
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:04,146
I feel like I got put
in a time-out.

541
00:28:04,148 --> 00:28:06,315
"Just go wait
by yourself, Jackie."

542
00:28:06,317 --> 00:28:09,318
"Yeah, go ahead.
Stand in the corner."

543
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,489
Blair Witch will see you now.

544
00:28:13,657 --> 00:28:15,424
<i>I don't hear it
chiming back anymore.</i>

545
00:28:15,426 --> 00:28:17,426
<i>Do you think maybe
they just turned it off?</i>

546
00:28:17,428 --> 00:28:18,761
<i>Let's hope so.</i>

547
00:28:18,763 --> 00:28:20,064
<i>Watch your head.</i>

548
00:28:20,831 --> 00:28:22,066
Professor Hopper?

549
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:27,069
Now this cave's
got to be really old.

550
00:28:27,071 --> 00:28:28,471
Professor Hopper?

551
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:30,205
Look at the formations.

552
00:28:30,207 --> 00:28:31,441
Oh, so you're a cave expert now.

553
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:33,378
I watched
the Discover Channel with Dad.

554
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:36,982
There's light ahead.

555
00:28:51,495 --> 00:28:52,496
Guys?

556
00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:02,374
Furby?

557
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:06,311
Why is the light
moving like that?

558
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:08,347
I don't know.

559
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:12,017
I've never seen
anything like it.

560
00:29:12,617 --> 00:29:14,086
That's so weird.

561
00:29:16,353 --> 00:29:18,588
Look, the tunnel keeps going.

562
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,822
It's probably just Furby

563
00:29:19,824 --> 00:29:22,157
screwing with his flashlight
or something.

564
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:24,359
Hey, Furby!

565
00:29:24,361 --> 00:29:26,130
Hey, give me a boost.

566
00:29:28,132 --> 00:29:30,167
- Got it?
- Yeah, I'm good.

567
00:29:41,212 --> 00:29:43,548
There's a rope...

568
00:29:44,882 --> 00:29:47,383
Oh, my god.

569
00:29:47,385 --> 00:29:49,684
Oh my god, Taylor,
take Veeves to the other room.

570
00:29:49,686 --> 00:29:51,154
Why?

571
00:29:51,156 --> 00:29:53,155
Just take her to the other room!

572
00:29:53,157 --> 00:29:54,857
- What's wrong?
- Damn it, Taylor!

573
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:56,427
- Take her to the other room!
- Yeah.

574
00:29:57,395 --> 00:29:58,397
Come on.

575
00:30:04,601 --> 00:30:06,702
- What's she freaking out about?
- I don't know.

576
00:30:06,704 --> 00:30:09,140
She's your sister
so we're gonna listen to her.

577
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:14,443
What is that?

578
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,082
- Shh.
- What?

579
00:30:19,583 --> 00:30:21,285
Hey, guys. What's up?

580
00:30:22,887 --> 00:30:25,453
- What are you doing?
- Oh, not much.

581
00:30:25,455 --> 00:30:27,623
Just... Can't walk, and...

582
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:30,459
You guys definitely left me
in that scary room

583
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:32,328
for what felt like forever.

584
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:35,463
But, uh, you know,
enough about me.

585
00:30:35,465 --> 00:30:38,466
How you doing?
How's your day been?

586
00:30:38,468 --> 00:30:40,435
- There you go.
- Taylor!

587
00:30:40,437 --> 00:30:42,405
- That room is creepy.
- Right there.

588
00:30:42,407 --> 00:30:43,940
There you go.

589
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:46,274
- What did you see up there?
- No! Sit.

590
00:30:46,276 --> 00:30:47,710
I'm not your dog, dude.

591
00:30:47,712 --> 00:30:49,712
Take it easy, Cara.

592
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:51,616
We're all dealing
with the same thing.

593
00:30:53,484 --> 00:30:54,653
Take off your camera.

594
00:30:55,686 --> 00:30:57,686
What's going on?

595
00:30:57,688 --> 00:30:59,356
Whatever it is, it'll be okay.

596
00:31:04,395 --> 00:31:07,396
Oh, my god. Cara.

597
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:09,732
Enough with the suspense, guys.
What is it?

598
00:31:09,734 --> 00:31:11,934
Stay over there!

599
00:31:11,936 --> 00:31:13,668
- We can't just leave him here.
- Leave who?

600
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:14,971
Jackie don't let her
come over here.

601
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:16,241
Is it Hopper?

602
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:21,646
Don't move. Okay?
I mean it.

603
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:27,219
No.

604
00:31:28,953 --> 00:31:30,386
- Wait, stop.
- Oh, my god. Cara!

605
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:31,654
No, Veeves, no!

606
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:32,722
- Is that Furby?
- No!

607
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,257
Hey, no, no, no!

608
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:36,392
Is he okay?

609
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:38,493
Is he
gonna be all right?

610
00:31:38,495 --> 00:31:40,398
Is he gonna be all right?

611
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,269
I think his neck is broken.

612
00:31:49,273 --> 00:31:50,609
How did this happen?

613
00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:56,544
I don't know
but we're gonna be okay.

614
00:31:56,546 --> 00:31:58,415
It's gonna be okay.

615
00:32:02,786 --> 00:32:05,588
I think he tried to climb down,
and somebody cut his rope.

616
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,057
Who would do this to us?

617
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:10,328
Who would cut Furby's rope?

618
00:32:15,532 --> 00:32:17,433
He didn't even want
to come down in the first place.

619
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:18,602
Why would he descend alone?

620
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:23,208
Oh, wow.
The camera's still on.

621
00:32:24,742 --> 00:32:27,076
Is there anything Furby
didn't bring in that backpack?

622
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:28,376
Grappling hook
would've been nice.

623
00:32:28,378 --> 00:32:29,511
<i>Team Hopper!</i>

624
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:33,616
Okay. This is it.

625
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,550
<i>Counting on you, stud.</i>

626
00:32:35,552 --> 00:32:37,853
<i>Counting on me for what?</i>

627
00:32:37,855 --> 00:32:39,588
<i>I don't know, dude.
It just sounded nicer</i>

628
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,022
<i>than "Don't screw anything up."</i>

629
00:32:41,024 --> 00:32:42,724
<i>We'll radio you at the bottom!</i>

630
00:32:42,726 --> 00:32:44,425
<i>So, what is it?
Like, one chime for "yes,"</i>

631
00:32:44,427 --> 00:32:47,730
<i>two chimes for "no," and
three chimes for "I love you"?</i>

632
00:32:47,732 --> 00:32:49,434
<i>Uh...</i>

633
00:32:55,439 --> 00:32:56,472
<i>Not sure if the rescue rangers</i>

634
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,107
<i>are playing a joke on me.</i>

635
00:32:58,109 --> 00:33:00,809
<i>But it's been radio silence
for like half an hour.</i>

636
00:33:00,811 --> 00:33:02,379
<i>Crikey, we better head over
and check it out.</i>

637
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:07,817
<i>Hello?</i>

638
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,687
<i>Hey, guys. What's the deal?</i>

639
00:33:16,793 --> 00:33:18,728
<i>I'm trying not to think
about it too much</i>

640
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:21,597
<i>'cause I'm not really
wired that way.</i>

641
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:23,732
<i>But it's kinda strange,
you know?</i>

642
00:33:23,734 --> 00:33:25,704
<i>And, "by strange," I mean scary.</i>

643
00:33:26,737 --> 00:33:28,370
<i>And, "by scary," I mean,</i>

644
00:33:28,372 --> 00:33:31,440
<i>I wish I haven't started
thinking about it.</i>

645
00:33:31,442 --> 00:33:32,907
<i>And now that I've been
thinking about it too much,</i>

646
00:33:32,909 --> 00:33:34,478
<i>I kinda hate myself.</i>

647
00:33:38,515 --> 00:33:39,618
<i>Now I have to poop.</i>

648
00:33:41,819 --> 00:33:44,520
<i>So, I was trying to find
a place to do a twosie,</i>

649
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:46,388
<i>and, oh, look what I found.</i>

650
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:48,723
<i>A cave, a rope, and a jeep.</i>

651
00:33:48,725 --> 00:33:50,224
<i>Do you guys think this is
where Hopper went down?</i>

652
00:33:50,226 --> 00:33:52,494
<i>Because I do.
Good work, Sherlock.</i>

653
00:33:52,496 --> 00:33:54,298
<i>You went down the wrong hole.</i>

654
00:33:55,666 --> 00:33:57,465
<i>So I found
Hopper's dad's journal,</i>

655
00:33:57,467 --> 00:33:59,001
<i>and it looks like he had
a little too much herbal fun</i>

656
00:33:59,003 --> 00:34:01,869
<i>in the '60s,
if you know what I mean,</i>

657
00:34:01,871 --> 00:34:04,806
<i>and got obsessed with a bunch
of fandom youth mythology.</i>

658
00:34:04,808 --> 00:34:06,442
<i>Just a bunch
of drawings and stories</i>

659
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:08,143
<i>about Spanish conquistadors</i>

660
00:34:08,145 --> 00:34:10,445
<i>trying to find some cave
that the natives said</i>

661
00:34:10,447 --> 00:34:12,683
<i>contained magical healing waters
or something.</i>

662
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:17,152
<i>It says the queen sent
a dozen expeditions</i>

663
00:34:17,154 --> 00:34:18,954
<i>to find this water
and bring a vial of it</i>

664
00:34:18,956 --> 00:34:20,889
<i>to her dying husband.</i>

665
00:34:20,891 --> 00:34:22,358
<i>All but one of the expeditions</i>

666
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,391
<i>either died at the hands
of the natives,</i>

667
00:34:23,393 --> 00:34:25,761
<i>or returned empty handed.</i>

668
00:34:25,763 --> 00:34:27,262
<i>The last expedition disappeared</i>

669
00:34:27,264 --> 00:34:29,532
<i>somewhere northwest
of the Alamo.</i>

670
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:30,933
<i>That sounds familiar.</i>

671
00:34:30,935 --> 00:34:31,867
<i>And it's the last thing
I wanna read</i>

672
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:33,538
<i>before it gets dark.</i>

673
00:34:35,672 --> 00:34:37,840
Guys, why is it sunset?

674
00:34:37,842 --> 00:34:41,509
There's no way it's that dark.
It's one o'clock.

675
00:34:41,511 --> 00:34:42,811
He must have a filter
on the camera.

676
00:34:42,813 --> 00:34:44,246
It's some kind of a joke.

677
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:45,980
- <i>Hear that...</i>
- It's gotta be a joke.

678
00:34:45,982 --> 00:34:47,449
<i>...are after something.</i>

679
00:34:47,451 --> 00:34:49,552
How is it a joke? It's dark,
and that's your dad's jeep.

680
00:34:49,554 --> 00:34:50,853
- So, I don't know what...
- Guys, if Furby's dead,

681
00:34:50,855 --> 00:34:52,520
he's probably not joking.

682
00:34:52,522 --> 00:34:55,657
<i>It's midnight now
and you guys aren't back.</i>

683
00:34:55,659 --> 00:34:58,793
<i>My cell has no signal
and is dead.</i>

684
00:34:58,795 --> 00:35:01,463
<i>I've no idea how to drive
this thing, so...</i>

685
00:35:01,465 --> 00:35:03,599
<i>Cara, when you see this,</i>

686
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:05,835
<i>have fun dealing with the wrath
that is my mother.</i>

687
00:35:08,839 --> 00:35:10,306
<i>Okay, so I'm not gonna lie,</i>

688
00:35:10,308 --> 00:35:11,974
<i>I got a little freaked out
by the coyotes</i>

689
00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:14,342
<i>so I turned the projector off
and read a little more</i>

690
00:35:14,344 --> 00:35:16,779
<i>of Hopper's
dad's journal instead.</i>

691
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:19,815
<i>So this magic water
healing story</i>

692
00:35:19,817 --> 00:35:21,349
<i>has been pass down
through his family</i>

693
00:35:21,351 --> 00:35:24,786
<i>but it wasn't until Hopper's dad
had kids of his own,</i>

694
00:35:24,788 --> 00:35:27,623
<i>and his daughter got sick,</i>

695
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:28,991
<i>till he went looking
for the cave.</i>

696
00:35:28,993 --> 00:35:31,893
<i>Which means, that this chick</i>

697
00:35:31,895 --> 00:35:34,730
<i>is the reason
my friends are missing.</i>

698
00:35:34,732 --> 00:35:36,699
<i>And coyotes
are gonna eat me tonight.</i>

699
00:35:40,804 --> 00:35:42,170
<i>Oh, hello.</i>

700
00:35:42,172 --> 00:35:43,739
<i>My mom probably
had a heart attack</i>

701
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:44,876
<i>'cause I didn't come home
last night.</i>

702
00:35:45,944 --> 00:35:47,610
<i>And you know what sucks?</i>

703
00:35:47,612 --> 00:35:50,012
<i>It just occurred to me that
no one knows we're here</i>

704
00:35:50,014 --> 00:35:51,380
<i>because we told them we're going</i>

705
00:35:51,382 --> 00:35:52,848
- <i>to Hamilton Pool.</i>
- What's happening?

706
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:54,516
Taylor...

707
00:35:54,518 --> 00:35:58,219
- This is a total mind fuck.
- Jackie...

708
00:35:58,221 --> 00:36:00,523
<i>So, not only am I
all alone up here,</i>

709
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:02,257
<i>but I have no idea
how to get back,</i>

710
00:36:02,259 --> 00:36:04,995
<i>no way to get back,
and no one's looking for me.</i>

711
00:36:06,596 --> 00:36:07,663
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

712
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:10,635
<i>It's Tuesday now.</i>

713
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:13,601
<i>The jeep is dead</i>

714
00:36:13,603 --> 00:36:16,672
<i>because I listened to the radio
all night because...</i>

715
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:20,009
<i>I might or might not be
afraid of the dark.</i>

716
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:23,945
<i>I ate all the food I could find
and drink all the water.</i>

717
00:36:23,947 --> 00:36:26,014
<i>And at this point
I've decided...</i>

718
00:36:26,016 --> 00:36:27,650
<i>That my friends
are probably dead.</i>

719
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:31,654
<i>And the only way
I'm gonna survive this...</i>

720
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:33,721
<i>is if I climb down
with Hopper's rope</i>

721
00:36:33,723 --> 00:36:34,892
<i>and look for his car keys.</i>

722
00:36:38,895 --> 00:36:40,895
<i>All right,
this part's for my mom.</i>

723
00:36:40,897 --> 00:36:42,565
<i>I'm really sorry
I didn't call you</i>

724
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:44,366
<i>to tell you where I went.</i>

725
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:46,837
<i>I was just really excited
to make some new friends.</i>

726
00:36:47,337 --> 00:36:48,904
<i>And...</i>

727
00:36:48,906 --> 00:36:51,639
<i>I think they really like me
this time.</i>

728
00:36:51,641 --> 00:36:54,846
<i>And, if for some reason,
you guys find this...</i>

729
00:36:56,313 --> 00:36:57,714
<i>I really hope you make it home.</i>

730
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:01,116
<i>Cool, calm, collected.</i>

731
00:37:01,118 --> 00:37:02,821
<i>Cool, calm, collected.
Cool, calm, collected.</i>

732
00:37:04,054 --> 00:37:05,723
<i>All right, let's party.</i>

733
00:37:08,625 --> 00:37:10,659
<i>Here we go.
Cool, calm, collected.</i>

734
00:37:10,661 --> 00:37:12,860
<i>Cool, calm, collected.
Cool, calm, collected.</i>

735
00:37:12,862 --> 00:37:14,730
<i>Like a real man.</i>

736
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:17,733
<i>Cool...</i>

737
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:19,768
<i>Calm...</i>

738
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:20,871
<i>And collect...</i>

739
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:24,008
<i>What the heck is that?</i>

740
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:28,610
What is it?

741
00:37:28,612 --> 00:37:30,645
- <i>Whoa!</i>
- He sees something.

742
00:37:36,654 --> 00:37:37,989
Oh, my god.

743
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:41,726
Please turn it off.

744
00:37:42,759 --> 00:37:43,861
So you got your answer.

745
00:37:44,761 --> 00:37:46,094
Are you satisfied?

746
00:37:46,096 --> 00:37:48,364
Or do you wanna keep going
until we're all dead?

747
00:37:48,366 --> 00:37:50,898
It doesn't make sense.
The timecode spans several days.

748
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:53,668
We've only been in here an hour.

749
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:55,971
Maybe we fell asleep
on the way down or something...

750
00:37:55,973 --> 00:37:58,907
All of us?
Are you kidding right now?

751
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:01,376
I never fell asleep.
Did you fall asleep?

752
00:38:01,378 --> 00:38:02,578
- Did you fall asleep?
- No...

753
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,645
- Nobody fell asleep!
- Jackie, calm down!

754
00:38:03,647 --> 00:38:04,713
Well, what do you
want me to say?

755
00:38:04,715 --> 00:38:06,815
Don't you think
if I had an answer,

756
00:38:06,817 --> 00:38:07,949
I would share it with you?

757
00:38:07,951 --> 00:38:09,384
You may not have an answer,

758
00:38:09,386 --> 00:38:10,886
but you're the only one
with an option

759
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:11,719
that the rest of don't have.

760
00:38:11,721 --> 00:38:13,123
Yeah, what option is that?

761
00:38:15,692 --> 00:38:17,092
You're the only one
who has a chance

762
00:38:17,094 --> 00:38:18,630
of climbing out of here?

763
00:38:24,868 --> 00:38:26,670
- Maybe I can do it?
- No.

764
00:38:27,971 --> 00:38:29,904
It's Veeves or it's you.

765
00:38:29,906 --> 00:38:31,840
Or we go deeper into the cave,

766
00:38:31,842 --> 00:38:33,308
we cross our fingers
and we hope...

767
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:36,078
No, no. It's way too dangerous.
You saw what happened to Furby.

768
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,079
Yeah, well, it's more dangerous
if we stay down here.

769
00:38:38,081 --> 00:38:40,049
There is somebody up there
cutting the ropes.

770
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:41,784
Yeah, well, I don't have a rope
for them to cut.

771
00:38:41,786 --> 00:38:42,918
- So, what does it matter?
- No.

772
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,887
None of this was supposed
to happen.

773
00:38:44,889 --> 00:38:48,456
You went looking for someone
who went missing

774
00:38:48,458 --> 00:38:51,826
while he was looking for
someone else that went missing.

775
00:38:51,828 --> 00:38:53,063
What'd you think would happen?

776
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,396
I don't know.

777
00:38:55,398 --> 00:38:56,697
I thought that we were
a step ahead

778
00:38:56,699 --> 00:38:59,571
because we found the rope
leading off of the van.

779
00:39:01,105 --> 00:39:02,173
Okay, I'm sorry.

780
00:39:14,217 --> 00:39:15,583
You're gonna be okay.

781
00:39:15,585 --> 00:39:16,684
You're with Taylor and Jackie,
for a little while.

782
00:39:16,686 --> 00:39:19,822
- Why?
- Jackie's right.

783
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:21,626
I'm the only one
who can get us out.

784
00:39:32,802 --> 00:39:33,904
Still rolling.

785
00:39:34,871 --> 00:39:35,873
You never know.

786
00:39:37,741 --> 00:39:38,976
Can I count on you?

787
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:00,765
Hey.

788
00:40:01,799 --> 00:40:02,800
Hey.

789
00:40:03,299 --> 00:40:04,735
Just hold on.

790
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,074
Here.

791
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:13,044
Take this with you.

792
00:40:14,043 --> 00:40:15,911
It's a GPS beacon.

793
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:18,846
It'll send out an SOS
from anywhere in the world.

794
00:40:18,848 --> 00:40:20,916
It'll work once you
get to the surface.

795
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:22,985
I packed it once I realized
how stupid it might be

796
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:24,920
going looking for somebody
who went missing

797
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:26,824
while he was looking
for somebody that went missing.

798
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:34,929
And, hey, don't come down
without help, okay?

799
00:40:34,931 --> 00:40:37,034
Why do I get the feeling
you know what's going on here?

800
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:39,771
I don't.

801
00:40:40,203 --> 00:40:41,272
You won't tell me?

802
00:40:43,206 --> 00:40:45,507
Fine. I mean, I'd like to know
what I'm climbing up to.

803
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:47,844
I think you owe me at least
that much, don't you?

804
00:40:50,815 --> 00:40:51,916
I think it's the sun.

805
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:55,083
I think it's days and nights.

806
00:40:55,085 --> 00:40:56,884
That's why the timecode
didn't match the videos.

807
00:40:56,886 --> 00:40:58,554
Seriously?

808
00:40:58,556 --> 00:41:00,956
That might be the dumbest thing
I've ever heard.

809
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,026
It's just an idea.

810
00:41:08,165 --> 00:41:09,233
Please don't fall.

811
00:41:17,174 --> 00:41:18,976
I'll be right here
if you need me.

812
00:41:32,589 --> 00:41:34,322
Remember,
alert the beacon first,

813
00:41:34,324 --> 00:41:37,058
- then drop the rope.
- I know, I know!

814
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:39,796
Alert the beacon, drop the rope.

815
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:41,998
Don't look down.

816
00:41:43,132 --> 00:41:44,599
- Okay.
- It should beep twice

817
00:41:44,601 --> 00:41:46,002
when it picks up a satellite.

818
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:00,284
How you doing?

819
00:42:01,317 --> 00:42:02,319
Almost there!

820
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:09,025
I can feel
the air changing again!

821
00:42:18,067 --> 00:42:19,369
Okay.

822
00:42:41,625 --> 00:42:43,090
Taylor!

823
00:42:43,092 --> 00:42:44,962
Taylor, the rope is gone!

824
00:42:47,063 --> 00:42:48,398
There's something wrong
with the air!

825
00:42:49,699 --> 00:42:50,967
Taylor!

826
00:42:52,168 --> 00:42:54,938
Okay.

827
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:58,940
Damn it!

828
00:42:58,942 --> 00:43:00,076
I'm gonna get a signal!

829
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:02,344
Come on!

830
00:43:02,346 --> 00:43:04,947
Shit!

831
00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:06,918
Come on! Please work.

832
00:43:13,357 --> 00:43:16,358
Oh, my god. Seriously?

833
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,128
Oh, come on.

834
00:43:18,462 --> 00:43:19,831
Come on!

835
00:43:31,708 --> 00:43:33,043
Come on.

836
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:36,280
Okay...

837
00:44:07,143 --> 00:44:08,145
Taylor!

838
00:44:11,181 --> 00:44:12,183
Taylor!

839
00:44:14,384 --> 00:44:15,953
You won't believe what happened.

840
00:44:17,286 --> 00:44:19,387
What do you mean
"what happened?"

841
00:44:19,389 --> 00:44:21,422
I have never seen
anything like it.

842
00:44:21,424 --> 00:44:23,025
Everything's gone, okay?

843
00:44:23,027 --> 00:44:24,360
There's no trees,
there's no grass.

844
00:44:24,362 --> 00:44:28,230
There's just rock everywhere,
these formations.

845
00:44:28,232 --> 00:44:30,465
Wait,
what about the GPS?

846
00:44:30,467 --> 00:44:33,137
I tried to activate the beacon
but I couldn't get a signal.

847
00:44:34,571 --> 00:44:35,770
It worked
before we left,

848
00:44:35,772 --> 00:44:36,871
I checked it in the jeep.

849
00:44:36,873 --> 00:44:38,040
Well, I walked
all over the place,

850
00:44:38,042 --> 00:44:40,509
I couldn't activate
the stupid thing.

851
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:42,543
- Hello?
- Come on, I got you.

852
00:44:42,545 --> 00:44:44,012
- A little help?
- I think...

853
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:45,514
- I think a bomb went off.
- Here, let me help you.

854
00:44:47,051 --> 00:44:49,317
When... when we came down.

855
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:51,319
- There's something in the sky.
- Here, sit down.

856
00:44:51,321 --> 00:44:53,822
There's a whole lot to tell you.

857
00:44:53,824 --> 00:44:54,690
- I'll tell you when I get down.
- If you guys can stop

858
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:57,425
running off. It's just an idea.

859
00:44:57,427 --> 00:44:58,626
Come on, I got you.

860
00:44:58,628 --> 00:45:00,031
Be careful,
you're almost down.

861
00:45:04,168 --> 00:45:05,436
Cara, come on, dude.

862
00:45:13,844 --> 00:45:15,610
"Come on" what?

863
00:45:15,612 --> 00:45:18,079
You were gone for, like,
two seconds.

864
00:45:18,081 --> 00:45:19,815
If you don't wanna climb
all the way up, just say so.

865
00:45:19,817 --> 00:45:20,916
I don't get it.

866
00:45:20,918 --> 00:45:24,219
It's not really
a good time for jokes.

867
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:27,157
No, I'm not joking.
Just watch the stupid playback.

868
00:45:28,391 --> 00:45:29,960
Just watch it.

869
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:35,265
Okay.

870
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:38,235
<i>How you doing?</i>

871
00:45:39,502 --> 00:45:41,037
<i>Almost there.</i>

872
00:45:43,373 --> 00:45:45,141
<i>I can feel the air
changing again.</i>

873
00:45:50,114 --> 00:45:53,083
<i>Taylor!
Taylor the rope is gone!</i>

874
00:45:55,286 --> 00:45:57,021
<i>There's something wrong
with the air!</i>

875
00:45:58,255 --> 00:45:59,290
<i>Taylor!</i>

876
00:46:05,261 --> 00:46:06,263
<i>Shit.</i>

877
00:46:10,266 --> 00:46:11,268
Hey.

878
00:46:12,136 --> 00:46:13,835
Will you say something?

879
00:46:13,837 --> 00:46:15,172
<i>...gonna get a signal!</i>

880
00:46:27,551 --> 00:46:28,552
Veeves...

881
00:46:29,418 --> 00:46:30,420
play mine.

882
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:37,395
This isn't possible.
How is this possible?

883
00:46:39,295 --> 00:46:40,297
Why is that?

884
00:46:41,697 --> 00:46:43,067
<i>How you doing?</i>

885
00:46:44,368 --> 00:46:46,233
<i>Almost there.</i>

886
00:46:46,235 --> 00:46:48,402
- <i>Taylor!</i>
- <i>What?</i>

887
00:46:48,404 --> 00:46:50,005
<i>You won't believe
what happened!</i>

888
00:46:50,007 --> 00:46:52,239
<i>What do you mean
"what happened"?</i>

889
00:46:52,241 --> 00:46:54,007
Believe me now?

890
00:46:54,009 --> 00:46:55,876
<i>Everything's gone, okay?
There's no trees...</i>

891
00:46:55,878 --> 00:46:57,581
Guys, I was up there
for 30 minutes.

892
00:46:58,581 --> 00:47:00,315
This is seconds.

893
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:04,588
Why are the tapes different?

894
00:47:06,355 --> 00:47:07,454
Why are the tapes different?

895
00:47:07,456 --> 00:47:10,192
What the hell
is going on, Taylor?

896
00:47:10,194 --> 00:47:12,527
I realized something
when we watched Furby's tape.

897
00:47:12,529 --> 00:47:14,628
A night had passed
in his footage.

898
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:17,599
But the rope was still running
from the cave to the van.

899
00:47:17,601 --> 00:47:20,467
It wasn't a person
who cut the rope...

900
00:47:20,469 --> 00:47:23,073
It was friction,
over a long period of time.

901
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:25,607
What?

902
00:47:25,609 --> 00:47:27,241
Time is passing differently
down here,

903
00:47:27,243 --> 00:47:28,344
than it is on the surface.

904
00:47:29,246 --> 00:47:30,247
What?

905
00:47:32,348 --> 00:47:34,215
It's the sun.

906
00:47:34,217 --> 00:47:35,286
Rising and setting.

907
00:47:36,752 --> 00:47:37,985
It's the only way
that Furby's tape

908
00:47:37,987 --> 00:47:39,253
was days ahead of ours,

909
00:47:39,255 --> 00:47:40,487
even though we all came in
at the same time.

910
00:47:40,489 --> 00:47:43,491
What? How long
have we been down here for?

911
00:47:43,493 --> 00:47:45,326
I have a date this weekend.

912
00:47:45,328 --> 00:47:46,661
Seriously?

913
00:47:46,663 --> 00:47:48,465
We've been in here weeks,
maybe months already.

914
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,235
I'm sorry, Veeves.

915
00:47:54,237 --> 00:47:55,638
I shouldn't have
brought you here.

916
00:47:57,975 --> 00:48:00,407
Why am I the one crying?

917
00:48:00,409 --> 00:48:02,376
You're 13.

918
00:48:02,378 --> 00:48:05,447
I'm not crying
because you're my big sister.

919
00:48:05,449 --> 00:48:07,251
And I know
you'll get us out of here.

920
00:48:17,427 --> 00:48:18,429
Whoa.

921
00:48:20,364 --> 00:48:23,234
So, every time that happens,
that's a day?

922
00:48:27,503 --> 00:48:29,507
Wait.
The Fountain of Youth.

923
00:48:30,973 --> 00:48:33,476
So, it's like if time stops...

924
00:48:34,543 --> 00:48:35,777
you stay young forever.

925
00:48:35,779 --> 00:48:37,681
Guys, this really is
the Fountain of Youth.

926
00:48:40,817 --> 00:48:42,152
Nothing?

927
00:48:42,819 --> 00:48:44,154
Okay.

928
00:48:46,355 --> 00:48:47,491
We have to get out of here.

929
00:49:02,371 --> 00:49:04,072
We've gotta have enough rope
in between what we've got here

930
00:49:04,074 --> 00:49:05,676
and what we've got in the
other room to get out of here.

931
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:07,976
For what?

932
00:49:07,978 --> 00:49:10,311
You want me to climb back
up there with all that rope?

933
00:49:10,313 --> 00:49:11,447
I'm running out
of ideas here.

934
00:49:13,417 --> 00:49:15,583
Take some time to rest.

935
00:49:15,585 --> 00:49:17,585
Just give me
like ten minutes.

936
00:49:17,587 --> 00:49:20,355
Ten minutes?
We don't have ten minutes.

937
00:49:20,357 --> 00:49:21,755
It's gonna take Taylor and I
at least half an hour,

938
00:49:21,757 --> 00:49:22,792
to climb out of here.

939
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:27,094
How long is half an hour
down here?

940
00:49:27,096 --> 00:49:29,364
Cara, you found Furby
facing down, right?

941
00:49:29,366 --> 00:49:30,565
Yeah. Why?

942
00:49:30,567 --> 00:49:32,366
In the video,
he was on his side.

943
00:49:32,368 --> 00:49:33,802
And his radio wasn't smashed.

944
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:36,307
So, what smashed his radio?

945
00:49:41,844 --> 00:49:44,681
<i>Whoa.
What the heck is that?</i>

946
00:49:46,616 --> 00:49:48,351
<i>Aah!</i>

947
00:49:52,621 --> 00:49:53,757
Great, this is it.

948
00:49:55,225 --> 00:49:57,458
<i>Furby,
stop messing around, man.</i>

949
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:59,027
<i>I swear to God.</i>

950
00:49:59,029 --> 00:50:00,762
<i>Drop us the rope
back down, dumbass.</i>

951
00:50:00,764 --> 00:50:02,366
<i>You almost killed Jackie.</i>

952
00:50:05,802 --> 00:50:06,804
<i>Furby?</i>

953
00:50:09,005 --> 00:50:10,773
Wait, Furby was still alive?

954
00:50:13,909 --> 00:50:15,509
<i>Hey, dude.
Are you okay up there?</i>

955
00:50:16,779 --> 00:50:17,947
So, it really was him
on the radio.

956
00:50:20,417 --> 00:50:22,384
<i>Furby,
stop messing around, man, okay?</i>

957
00:50:22,386 --> 00:50:24,219
<i>We got something down here,</i>

958
00:50:24,221 --> 00:50:24,987
<i>and I need you to throw down
the other end of the rope.</i>

959
00:50:24,989 --> 00:50:25,454
<i>Right now.</i>

960
00:50:26,156 --> 00:50:28,655
<i>Furby?</i>

961
00:50:31,395 --> 00:50:33,128
<i>Professor Hopper?</i>

962
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:34,496
<i>This is Taylor, we're gonna
get you out of here.</i>

963
00:50:34,498 --> 00:50:35,532
Help me.

964
00:50:36,833 --> 00:50:37,835
<i>Who is this?</i>

965
00:50:45,174 --> 00:50:46,609
Taylor, help me.

966
00:50:49,179 --> 00:50:50,612
<i>Professor Hopper?</i>

967
00:50:50,614 --> 00:50:51,615
<i>Is that you?</i>

968
00:50:53,917 --> 00:50:55,286
<i>Furby...</i>

969
00:50:56,953 --> 00:50:58,520
<i>Who is this?</i>

970
00:50:58,522 --> 00:51:00,121
<i>Who's on this channel?</i>

971
00:51:00,123 --> 00:51:01,588
Dude, it's Furby.

972
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:18,407
What the hell?

973
00:51:21,645 --> 00:51:23,744
Wait!

974
00:51:23,746 --> 00:51:25,846
<i>Ah! Help!</i>

975
00:51:25,848 --> 00:51:27,014
<i>No. No, no, no!</i>

976
00:51:44,868 --> 00:51:46,503
What just happened?

977
00:51:57,913 --> 00:51:59,415
There's someone in here.

978
00:51:59,882 --> 00:52:01,384
And it's not Hopper.

979
00:52:04,087 --> 00:52:05,488
I'm gonna be sick.

980
00:52:14,931 --> 00:52:17,532
Don't worry about me.
Just watch the tunnel.

981
00:52:17,534 --> 00:52:18,900
And, Veeves,
watch for falling rocks.

982
00:52:18,902 --> 00:52:20,101
She's gonna be fine.

983
00:52:20,103 --> 00:52:22,704
But no matter what,
you can't look up, okay?

984
00:52:22,706 --> 00:52:24,908
Thanks. I get it.

985
00:52:28,612 --> 00:52:29,713
You got it, Cara!

986
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:36,884
You got this.
Just take it

987
00:52:36,886 --> 00:52:37,888
a little bit at a time.

988
00:52:39,288 --> 00:52:40,922
Oh, my god.

989
00:52:40,924 --> 00:52:42,757
Sorry. I'll shut up.

990
00:52:42,759 --> 00:52:43,761
Okay, okay.

991
00:52:49,565 --> 00:52:50,965
Veeves,

992
00:52:50,967 --> 00:52:51,733
this is exactly what we're
trying to avoid right now.

993
00:52:51,735 --> 00:52:52,567
It's Furby's footage.

994
00:52:52,569 --> 00:52:53,637
Don't watch that.

995
00:52:54,705 --> 00:52:55,936
I noticed
something earlier.

996
00:52:55,938 --> 00:52:57,271
What?

997
00:52:57,273 --> 00:52:58,775
He sees something here. Wait.

998
00:53:00,009 --> 00:53:01,544
You can slow
the playback.

999
00:53:03,246 --> 00:53:04,514
Do you see that?

1000
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:07,648
That, right there.

1001
00:53:07,650 --> 00:53:09,284
The sun's path keeps changing.

1002
00:53:09,286 --> 00:53:11,786
What?
Why is it doing that?

1003
00:53:11,788 --> 00:53:12,790
Oh, my god.

1004
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:14,925
It's not just the sun.

1005
00:53:15,926 --> 00:53:18,625
- What?
- It's the seasons.

1006
00:53:18,627 --> 00:53:20,696
This thing is the sun
shifting on the horizon.

1007
00:53:23,299 --> 00:53:24,166
Oh, my god,
you're right.

1008
00:53:24,168 --> 00:53:26,333
That's not just one revolution.

1009
00:53:26,335 --> 00:53:27,569
It's hundreds.

1010
00:53:27,571 --> 00:53:28,936
Wait, what did she say?

1011
00:53:28,938 --> 00:53:31,639
That's why everything
was so different on the surface.

1012
00:53:31,641 --> 00:53:33,741
We've been down here
a really long time.

1013
00:53:33,743 --> 00:53:35,610
What?

1014
00:53:35,612 --> 00:53:38,645
Guys, what's going on
down there? What's on the video?

1015
00:53:38,647 --> 00:53:39,880
Guys, this is bad.

1016
00:53:39,882 --> 00:53:42,317
This is really, really bad.

1017
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:44,117
Guys,
what's on the video?

1018
00:53:44,119 --> 00:53:46,587
Those are entire years.

1019
00:53:46,589 --> 00:53:48,755
It's the solstice, that's the
only thing that makes sense.

1020
00:53:48,757 --> 00:53:49,790
Seriously?

1021
00:53:49,792 --> 00:53:51,728
Each of those is a year,
not a day?

1022
00:53:52,862 --> 00:53:54,161
How long is that?

1023
00:53:54,163 --> 00:53:56,567
Taylor, we've been
in here for hours.

1024
00:53:56,967 --> 00:53:59,000
So...

1025
00:53:59,002 --> 00:54:00,871
Holy shit...

1026
00:54:06,875 --> 00:54:08,076
- Whoa!
- Oh, my god.

1027
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:09,344
Cara, look up!

1028
00:54:12,181 --> 00:54:13,947
- Ah! Whoa!
- Jackie!

1029
00:54:13,949 --> 00:54:16,016
- Go!
- Are you okay?

1030
00:54:16,018 --> 00:54:17,751
Come on.

1031
00:54:17,753 --> 00:54:18,788
The hell is that?

1032
00:54:20,156 --> 00:54:21,355
Cara, be careful!

1033
00:54:23,092 --> 00:54:24,594
We're being rescued.

1034
00:54:25,628 --> 00:54:26,830
Hey, Cara, climb up it!

1035
00:54:38,407 --> 00:54:39,775
This thing is huge.

1036
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:45,947
Dude...

1037
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:47,117
Wait, there's something
coming down.

1038
00:54:49,185 --> 00:54:50,554
What is that?

1039
00:54:51,186 --> 00:54:53,688
That is a giant.

1040
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:54,956
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

1041
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:56,126
Veeves, stay back.

1042
00:55:00,563 --> 00:55:01,797
Come on, let's go.

1043
00:55:03,732 --> 00:55:04,834
Oh, my god.

1044
00:55:06,002 --> 00:55:07,538
I don't wanna go back up.

1045
00:55:14,677 --> 00:55:15,746
Dude, look!

1046
00:55:18,081 --> 00:55:19,980
Where did he come from?

1047
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,708
Okay, okay, okay.

1048
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:48,976
All right, go.

1049
00:55:52,982 --> 00:55:54,116
- Go!
- How far does it go?

1050
00:55:55,851 --> 00:55:57,751
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1051
00:55:57,753 --> 00:55:58,886
We can stay
ahead of him.

1052
00:55:58,888 --> 00:56:00,721
His suit looks hard to move in.

1053
00:56:00,723 --> 00:56:02,592
On your leg, okay?

1054
00:56:03,726 --> 00:56:05,092
I'm good.

1055
00:56:05,094 --> 00:56:07,929
Guys, it hurts.

1056
00:56:07,931 --> 00:56:09,996
I can't... I have to stop.

1057
00:56:09,998 --> 00:56:11,132
What is this place?

1058
00:56:13,069 --> 00:56:14,802
I think we lost him.

1059
00:56:14,804 --> 00:56:16,003
He's moving pretty slow.

1060
00:56:16,005 --> 00:56:16,806
Wait, no, no. Go, go, go!

1061
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:20,741
- Okay!
- Go!

1062
00:56:20,743 --> 00:56:21,911
It looks like
the ground's wet.

1063
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:28,952
Go, go!

1064
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:32,990
Faster.
Let's go faster.

1065
00:56:36,192 --> 00:56:37,894
I think I see light
up ahead.

1066
00:56:39,828 --> 00:56:40,897
Wait, it's fire.

1067
00:56:42,898 --> 00:56:44,766
Why is there fire?

1068
00:56:44,768 --> 00:56:46,101
Guys, there's someone else
in here.

1069
00:56:46,103 --> 00:56:47,835
- Veeves, take Jackie.
- Shit. Ow.

1070
00:56:47,837 --> 00:56:49,137
- You good?
- Uh-huh.

1071
00:56:49,139 --> 00:56:50,173
Come on, I got you.

1072
00:56:55,110 --> 00:56:57,512
There's no pulse,
but she's warm.

1073
00:56:57,514 --> 00:56:59,514
- She just died.
- Oh, my god.

1074
00:56:59,516 --> 00:57:01,215
- What?
- This is Hopper's mom.

1075
00:57:01,217 --> 00:57:03,016
What?

1076
00:57:03,018 --> 00:57:04,787
She's been here
for 40 years.

1077
00:57:06,054 --> 00:57:07,889
I think we lost him.

1078
00:57:07,891 --> 00:57:09,960
Taylor, look,
from the photos.

1079
00:57:14,029 --> 00:57:15,865
Oh,
that's Hopper's dad.

1080
00:57:19,034 --> 00:57:20,867
Who are those guys?

1081
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:27,108
And what are they doing
with a gun?

1082
00:57:29,145 --> 00:57:30,213
Oh, shit.

1083
00:57:35,250 --> 00:57:36,285
Go, go now.

1084
00:57:40,556 --> 00:57:41,891
Come on, hurry. Go.

1085
00:57:45,994 --> 00:57:47,063
Go. Hurry, hurry.

1086
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:19,393
Let's go.

1087
00:58:28,036 --> 00:58:29,402
Shh!

1088
00:58:33,409 --> 00:58:35,876
Oh, my god, guys.
What about Taylor?

1089
00:58:35,878 --> 00:58:37,878
You stay here.
You don't move from Jackie.

1090
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:39,049
- Do you promise me?
- Okay.

1091
00:58:39,949 --> 00:58:41,017
Be careful.

1092
00:58:42,085 --> 00:58:43,119
Come here.

1093
00:58:47,322 --> 00:58:48,792
It'll be okay.

1094
00:58:50,393 --> 00:58:53,027
Taylor... Taylor!

1095
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:54,264
Oh, my...

1096
00:59:02,337 --> 00:59:03,973
You can't.

1097
00:59:06,174 --> 00:59:08,010
You can't leave me here!

1098
00:59:37,072 --> 00:59:38,204
Oh, my god.

1099
00:59:38,206 --> 00:59:39,940
You've got to wake up.

1100
00:59:39,942 --> 00:59:41,076
Come on, just wake up.

1101
00:59:44,681 --> 00:59:46,047
Oh, my god.

1102
00:59:46,049 --> 00:59:47,150
Wake up.

1103
00:59:48,083 --> 00:59:49,416
Wake up.

1104
00:59:49,418 --> 00:59:50,821
Please...

1105
00:59:54,690 --> 00:59:55,891
No.

1106
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:59,259
No, no!

1107
00:59:59,261 --> 01:00:01,094
No! Don't touch him!

1108
01:00:01,096 --> 01:00:02,198
No, no!

1109
01:00:02,665 --> 01:00:04,065
Ah!

1110
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:34,264
No, no, no, no!

1111
01:00:35,397 --> 01:00:36,398
What are you doing?

1112
01:00:37,532 --> 01:00:39,034
Stop! You'll kill him!

1113
01:01:20,442 --> 01:01:21,808
Oh, my god.

1114
01:01:21,810 --> 01:01:23,013
What happened?

1115
01:01:25,047 --> 01:01:26,049
Come on.

1116
01:01:32,054 --> 01:01:33,253
We have to get
Veeves and Jackie.

1117
01:01:33,255 --> 01:01:34,788
No, wait.

1118
01:01:34,790 --> 01:01:36,325
There's another one.
Stay back.

1119
01:01:53,208 --> 01:01:54,074
We have to help him.

1120
01:01:57,112 --> 01:01:58,179
What's wrong with him?

1121
01:02:12,527 --> 01:02:13,529
We have to help him.

1122
01:02:16,331 --> 01:02:17,333
Cara!

1123
01:02:29,612 --> 01:02:30,981
Stay back.

1124
01:02:37,252 --> 01:02:38,253
He needs his mask
to breath.

1125
01:02:45,261 --> 01:02:46,295
What's wrong with him?

1126
01:02:49,831 --> 01:02:51,100
Oh, no.

1127
01:02:52,301 --> 01:02:53,402
He's out of time.

1128
01:03:24,299 --> 01:03:25,331
Okay...

1129
01:03:25,333 --> 01:03:26,400
Veeves!

1130
01:03:26,402 --> 01:03:27,637
They're okay. Let's go.

1131
01:03:39,714 --> 01:03:41,181
What's he doing?

1132
01:03:43,552 --> 01:03:45,188
Did they
just fall asleep?

1133
01:03:47,556 --> 01:03:48,590
Cara!

1134
01:03:49,458 --> 01:03:50,724
Veeves!

1135
01:03:50,726 --> 01:03:51,561
- Oh, my god.
- You're okay!

1136
01:03:53,962 --> 01:03:55,598
We're all right.

1137
01:03:57,967 --> 01:03:59,335
Are
these guys sleeping?

1138
01:04:01,603 --> 01:04:03,337
How did you
manage that?

1139
01:04:03,339 --> 01:04:05,074
We didn't do it.
He did.

1140
01:04:06,542 --> 01:04:08,078
What year are you from?

1141
01:04:09,212 --> 01:04:10,677
Tell us
what year are you from.

1142
01:04:10,679 --> 01:04:12,413
What happened to him?

1143
01:04:12,415 --> 01:04:13,516
He can't breathe our air.

1144
01:04:22,225 --> 01:04:23,590
<i>We've reached
the two-week mark...</i>

1145
01:04:23,592 --> 01:04:24,491
- Holy cow.
- <i>in the search for five...</i>

1146
01:04:24,493 --> 01:04:26,094
<i>missing students.</i>

1147
01:04:26,096 --> 01:04:28,362
<i>The three college
and two middle school students</i>

1148
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:30,496
<i>disappeared 14 days ago</i>

1149
01:04:30,498 --> 01:04:31,764
<i>and are thought
to have been headed west</i>

1150
01:04:31,766 --> 01:04:34,235
<i>in a green Land Rover Defender.</i>

1151
01:04:34,237 --> 01:04:35,469
<i>Travis and Williamson County...</i>

1152
01:04:35,471 --> 01:04:38,471
Please. Just tell us
what year you're from.

1153
01:04:40,643 --> 01:04:42,041
<i>Joining us tonight</i>

1154
01:04:42,043 --> 01:04:43,076
<i>is the father
of two of the missing.</i>

1155
01:04:43,078 --> 01:04:46,380
<i>Cara and Veeves Pintauro.</i>

1156
01:04:46,382 --> 01:04:48,248
<i>Thank you for speaking
with us tonight, Rich.</i>

1157
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:49,416
<i>We appreciate it.</i>

1158
01:04:49,418 --> 01:04:51,083
<i>Yeah, Carter,</i>

1159
01:04:51,085 --> 01:04:52,853
<i>I'm asking for help
from the public tonight.</i>

1160
01:04:52,855 --> 01:04:55,422
<i>It's been two weeks
since I've seen my daughters.</i>

1161
01:04:55,424 --> 01:04:58,324
<i>So, I'm asking anybody,
please look at these pictures.</i>

1162
01:04:58,326 --> 01:05:01,728
<i>And, if you've seen them,
contact your local authorities.</i>

1163
01:05:01,730 --> 01:05:03,364
<i>I need my girls back.</i>

1164
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:07,268
Please, I don't know
what you're saying.

1165
01:05:07,270 --> 01:05:08,304
What is he saying?

1166
01:05:17,313 --> 01:05:18,612
I don't know what you're saying.

1167
01:05:25,154 --> 01:05:27,688
<i>We must
continue to go into space</i>

1168
01:05:27,690 --> 01:05:30,590
<i>for the future of humanity.</i>

1169
01:05:30,592 --> 01:05:34,427
<i>I don't think we will survive
another thousand years</i>

1170
01:05:34,429 --> 01:05:38,299
<i>without escaping beyond
our fragile planet.</i>

1171
01:05:38,301 --> 01:05:40,302
<i>We want to leap into the future.</i>

1172
01:05:41,436 --> 01:05:43,170
<i>We want major breakthroughs.</i>

1173
01:05:43,172 --> 01:05:45,706
<i>American footprints
on distant worlds,</i>

1174
01:05:45,708 --> 01:05:47,241
<i>are not too big a dream.</i>

1175
01:05:47,243 --> 01:05:48,842
<i>They're calling it
"The Arc."</i>

1176
01:05:48,844 --> 01:05:51,712
<i>Fifteen miles long
and two miles across.</i>

1177
01:05:51,714 --> 01:05:54,782
<i>The ship may hold
up to 250,000 people.</i>

1178
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:56,317
<i>Once in orbit,
it will put to use</i>

1179
01:05:56,319 --> 01:05:59,085
<i>the world's first
hyper-accelerator,</i>

1180
01:05:59,087 --> 01:06:01,822
<i>capable of sending ships
as far as Mars,</i>

1181
01:06:01,824 --> 01:06:04,324
<i>in a matter of hours.</i>

1182
01:06:04,326 --> 01:06:06,092
<i>As we take off...</i>

1183
01:06:06,094 --> 01:06:08,329
<i>As we take the final steps
toward the colonization,</i>

1184
01:06:08,331 --> 01:06:09,996
<i>of our new home planet, Mars,</i>

1185
01:06:09,998 --> 01:06:12,467
<i>and hope that one day
we may return to planet Earth.</i>

1186
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:20,609
That happened
while we were down here?

1187
01:06:24,679 --> 01:06:26,215
Is this really real?

1188
01:06:29,418 --> 01:06:31,585
We've been in here that long?

1189
01:06:31,587 --> 01:06:34,654
It was like thousands
of years went by.

1190
01:06:34,656 --> 01:06:36,456
Long enough for people
to be eight-feet-tall

1191
01:06:36,458 --> 01:06:37,824
and speak a different language.

1192
01:06:37,826 --> 01:06:39,428
So then we're just stuck
in here?

1193
01:06:41,364 --> 01:06:42,365
Forever?

1194
01:06:48,404 --> 01:06:49,772
Even if we can get
to the surface...

1195
01:06:50,906 --> 01:06:53,407
everything we've known is gone.

1196
01:06:53,409 --> 01:06:54,507
That can't be right.

1197
01:06:54,509 --> 01:06:55,844
What about everybody back home?

1198
01:06:57,779 --> 01:06:59,748
- What about Mom and Dad?
- Hey, hey.

1199
01:07:02,418 --> 01:07:03,951
We still have each other.

1200
01:07:03,953 --> 01:07:06,656
And Jackie and Taylor are here
with us, we'll figure it out.

1201
01:07:08,424 --> 01:07:09,659
We'll figure it out.

1202
01:07:13,828 --> 01:07:15,297
What are we gonna do?

1203
01:07:23,139 --> 01:07:25,405
Okay, we have two options.

1204
01:07:25,407 --> 01:07:27,407
We either get out
of here right now,

1205
01:07:27,409 --> 01:07:29,610
or we accept that we are staying
in here forever.

1206
01:07:29,612 --> 01:07:32,512
Because if that guy is what
humans have evolved to, then...

1207
01:07:32,514 --> 01:07:33,547
what are we gonna
be dealing with

1208
01:07:33,549 --> 01:07:35,384
by the time we get
to the surface.

1209
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:41,154
No matter what's up there,

1210
01:07:41,156 --> 01:07:42,891
we have a way out now
and we should use it.

1211
01:07:43,525 --> 01:07:44,558
Taylor.

1212
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:45,561
Look.

1213
01:07:47,962 --> 01:07:49,564
Oh, my god!

1214
01:07:52,134 --> 01:07:53,336
What is it?

1215
01:07:53,802 --> 01:07:54,837
Hopper was here.

1216
01:07:56,739 --> 01:07:58,538
He must have gone down
on another tunnel.

1217
01:07:58,540 --> 01:07:59,741
Taylor, we have to go.

1218
01:08:01,777 --> 01:08:03,309
I know what I said...

1219
01:08:03,311 --> 01:08:05,545
But if we don't find him, this
would've all been for nothing.

1220
01:08:05,547 --> 01:08:06,646
- What?
- Hopper's the only one

1221
01:08:06,648 --> 01:08:07,848
who's gonna know
what to do right now.

1222
01:08:07,850 --> 01:08:08,851
Oh, my god.

1223
01:08:09,752 --> 01:08:10,753
Seriously?

1224
01:08:15,523 --> 01:08:16,590
Wait a minute.

1225
01:08:16,592 --> 01:08:18,494
What about the cowboy's gun?

1226
01:08:20,195 --> 01:08:21,463
Thanks, Jackie.

1227
01:08:26,502 --> 01:08:27,835
There's four shots left.

1228
01:08:27,837 --> 01:08:29,472
You guys get Furby,
I'll be right back.

1229
01:08:31,206 --> 01:08:32,872
If you hear gunshots,
don't wait for me, okay?

1230
01:08:32,874 --> 01:08:33,909
Just go.

1231
01:09:41,576 --> 01:09:42,578
Hopper?

1232
01:10:11,339 --> 01:10:13,739
Hopper?

1233
01:10:22,718 --> 01:10:23,783
Hopper!

1234
01:10:26,722 --> 01:10:27,790
Professor Hopper.

1235
01:10:30,058 --> 01:10:32,024
Professor, it's Taylor.

1236
01:10:32,026 --> 01:10:34,760
She's stuck.

1237
01:10:34,762 --> 01:10:36,596
- What?
- We're too late.

1238
01:10:59,687 --> 01:11:00,956
She was my sister.

1239
01:11:04,026 --> 01:11:05,495
She's trapped.

1240
01:11:06,328 --> 01:11:09,162
Everything slows down in there.

1241
01:11:09,164 --> 01:11:10,831
Just like everything
slowed down

1242
01:11:10,833 --> 01:11:12,502
as soon as you walked inside.

1243
01:11:37,092 --> 01:11:38,127
That's it.

1244
01:11:39,395 --> 01:11:40,763
You actually found it.

1245
01:11:44,932 --> 01:11:45,998
This whole cave
is a system

1246
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,835
geared, designed
to protect The Fountain.

1247
01:11:48,837 --> 01:11:50,970
Each layer's a different speed
than the last.

1248
01:11:50,972 --> 01:11:52,439
Taylor!

1249
01:11:52,441 --> 01:11:54,006
We need your help with Furby!

1250
01:11:54,008 --> 01:11:55,908
Jackie?

1251
01:11:55,910 --> 01:11:57,579
Jackie, down here.

1252
01:11:59,048 --> 01:12:00,782
Stop. Don't go in there.

1253
01:12:02,116 --> 01:12:03,216
If you go in there,
I'm not gonna be able

1254
01:12:03,218 --> 01:12:04,554
to get you out.

1255
01:12:05,820 --> 01:12:07,589
Taylor!

1256
01:12:09,090 --> 01:12:10,323
Come on.

1257
01:12:10,325 --> 01:12:11,524
Come on, Hopper, we gotta go.

1258
01:12:11,526 --> 01:12:12,458
- Come on!
- Wait. I can't move.

1259
01:12:12,460 --> 01:12:14,894
- Come on!
- I can't move.

1260
01:12:15,963 --> 01:12:17,132
Okay. Okay, come on.

1261
01:12:19,234 --> 01:12:21,234
It's bad.

1262
01:12:21,236 --> 01:12:22,903
They stabbed me
straight through.

1263
01:12:22,905 --> 01:12:23,906
Oh, my god.

1264
01:12:26,808 --> 01:12:28,809
The water's only a few
hundred feet, let's go.

1265
01:12:28,811 --> 01:12:30,179
- Come on!
- Stop!

1266
01:12:32,481 --> 01:12:33,715
I'm done.

1267
01:12:34,717 --> 01:12:36,118
Can't you see I'm done?

1268
01:12:40,755 --> 01:12:42,088
Well, maybe I'm not?

1269
01:12:42,090 --> 01:12:43,357
I'll bring the water
to you.

1270
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:45,492
I'm gonna be dead
in five minutes, just go.

1271
01:12:47,262 --> 01:12:48,731
Just go.

1272
01:12:49,998 --> 01:12:52,064
It'll take me forever
to walk back.

1273
01:12:52,066 --> 01:12:53,800
Even with your help.

1274
01:12:53,802 --> 01:12:55,771
Get out now before there's more
of 'em.

1275
01:12:58,807 --> 01:12:59,939
I'll take that though...

1276
01:12:59,941 --> 01:13:02,074
Buy you some time.

1277
01:13:02,076 --> 01:13:03,877
- Taylor?
- Just get out of here. Go!

1278
01:13:03,879 --> 01:13:05,845
Taylor we need
your help with Furby.

1279
01:13:05,847 --> 01:13:08,014
Go.

1280
01:13:08,016 --> 01:13:10,283
I didn't come this far
to leave without you.

1281
01:13:10,285 --> 01:13:12,755
I got what I came for, Taylor,
just go!

1282
01:13:13,922 --> 01:13:15,023
I'll be right back.

1283
01:13:18,026 --> 01:13:19,091
Taylor!

1284
01:13:56,164 --> 01:13:57,463
He's not that far away.

1285
01:13:57,465 --> 01:13:59,498
I can probably get there
and back in a few minutes.

1286
01:14:01,236 --> 01:14:02,568
Even if I have to carry him.

1287
01:14:02,570 --> 01:14:05,271
Uh... Well, this time,
I'm going with you.

1288
01:14:05,273 --> 01:14:06,540
How long is this supposed
to take?

1289
01:14:06,542 --> 01:14:08,241
My ankle just took seconds.

1290
01:14:08,243 --> 01:14:09,274
All right. Hopefully,

1291
01:14:09,276 --> 01:14:10,844
Furby won't take
that long either.

1292
01:14:10,846 --> 01:14:12,080
Yeah. That's unlikely.

1293
01:14:12,513 --> 01:14:13,680
Veeves!

1294
01:14:13,682 --> 01:14:15,948
I think we're good.

1295
01:14:15,950 --> 01:14:17,984
Be ready to light it
no matter what.

1296
01:14:31,667 --> 01:14:34,067
Shall we try to put
the space guy in or...

1297
01:14:34,069 --> 01:14:35,534
I mean he did us a favor, right?

1298
01:14:36,605 --> 01:14:38,838
Uh, guys...

1299
01:14:42,977 --> 01:14:44,243
Oh, shit.

1300
01:14:44,245 --> 01:14:45,711
They're coming,
we have to go now.

1301
01:14:45,713 --> 01:14:48,014
- Veeves, light it. Let's go!
- Taylor, they're waking up. Run!

1302
01:14:48,016 --> 01:14:49,983
Taylor,
grab the lightsaber thing.

1303
01:14:49,985 --> 01:14:52,085
Hurry, hurry. Go!

1304
01:14:56,357 --> 01:14:58,293
Guys, go!
Faster, come on!

1305
01:15:02,129 --> 01:15:03,164
Come on, let's go!

1306
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:08,134
Hurry!
They're right behind us.

1307
01:15:09,303 --> 01:15:11,637
Whoa! Holy shit!
The light stopped moving.

1308
01:15:11,639 --> 01:15:12,842
How does it work?

1309
01:15:14,243 --> 01:15:15,274
Whoa!

1310
01:15:17,145 --> 01:15:19,412
Hurry. Go!

1311
01:15:19,414 --> 01:15:21,150
- They're coming.
- Go, go. Come on, Veeves.

1312
01:15:22,351 --> 01:15:23,684
Go!
I'm right behind you.

1313
01:15:23,686 --> 01:15:25,318
Guys! Come on, go!
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

1314
01:15:27,121 --> 01:15:29,023
- They're here!
- Oh, my god!

1315
01:15:29,624 --> 01:15:30,890
Hurry!

1316
01:15:32,128 --> 01:15:34,394
- Veeves, how you doin'?
- I got this.

1317
01:15:34,396 --> 01:15:36,098
- Jackie?
- Killin' it!

1318
01:15:37,132 --> 01:15:38,064
Go faster.

1319
01:15:38,066 --> 01:15:40,199
Guys!

1320
01:15:40,201 --> 01:15:42,335
Something's really,
really wrong here.

1321
01:15:42,337 --> 01:15:44,371
Something's really,
really wrong down here too.

1322
01:15:44,373 --> 01:15:46,072
What is that? Is that water?

1323
01:15:46,074 --> 01:15:48,308
Between water
and psycho-Flintstones?

1324
01:15:48,310 --> 01:15:50,042
I say keep climbing.

1325
01:16:00,187 --> 01:16:01,356
Cara, be careful.

1326
01:16:03,991 --> 01:16:05,292
Cara!

1327
01:16:05,294 --> 01:16:07,159
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, my god!

1328
01:16:07,161 --> 01:16:09,061
Hold on tight!

1329
01:16:09,063 --> 01:16:10,363
Oh, my god! It has my arm!

1330
01:16:10,365 --> 01:16:11,967
Cara!

1331
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:20,674
Taylor!

1332
01:16:20,676 --> 01:16:22,975
Grab me! I got you!

1333
01:16:22,977 --> 01:16:25,278
It has my leg!

1334
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:27,314
- Come on, Cara!
- Help!

1335
01:16:27,316 --> 01:16:29,082
It has my leg!

1336
01:16:29,084 --> 01:16:30,853
Guys?

1337
01:16:32,721 --> 01:16:34,320
No, don't!

1338
01:16:36,657 --> 01:16:37,927
Cara!

1339
01:18:02,477 --> 01:18:04,980
Oh, my god.

1340
01:18:09,450 --> 01:18:11,818
Oh, my god!

1341
01:18:11,820 --> 01:18:13,452
Whoa!
Jackie, are you okay?

1342
01:18:13,454 --> 01:18:15,188
Whoa! No. No. No.

1343
01:18:15,190 --> 01:18:17,122
Taylor,
they're climbing!

1344
01:18:22,097 --> 01:18:23,965
Guys! Look!

1345
01:18:29,103 --> 01:18:30,940
Oh, shit!

1346
01:18:32,473 --> 01:18:33,773
- Cara?
- Hold still!

1347
01:18:33,775 --> 01:18:35,809
It's a bumpy ride once you break
through the water.

1348
01:18:35,811 --> 01:18:37,543
One at a time.
Veeves, you go in first.

1349
01:18:37,545 --> 01:18:39,181
- Wait!
- Ready?

1350
01:18:41,083 --> 01:18:42,217
Oh, my god!

1351
01:18:44,518 --> 01:18:46,485
Taylor, off the wall.

1352
01:18:46,487 --> 01:18:48,320
- Where are we going?
- I'll see you on the other side.

1353
01:18:48,322 --> 01:18:49,557
Just get off the wall.

1354
01:18:56,498 --> 01:18:58,864
Oh, my god, Cara. I don't know!

1355
01:18:58,866 --> 01:19:01,434
It's gonna be fine.
Just hold your breath. Ready?

1356
01:19:01,436 --> 01:19:03,635
Oh, man! What about Furby
and Hopper?

1357
01:19:03,637 --> 01:19:05,305
Once you break through,
we'll have all the time

1358
01:19:05,307 --> 01:19:07,142
that we need.
Just hold your breath.

1359
01:19:08,110 --> 01:19:09,208
Are you ready?

1360
01:19:09,210 --> 01:19:11,144
I don't like this.

1361
01:19:12,013 --> 01:19:13,581
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa...

1362
01:19:55,423 --> 01:19:56,555
Guys?

1363
01:20:01,562 --> 01:20:02,563
Guys?

1364
01:20:06,601 --> 01:20:07,603
Whoa!

1365
01:20:47,575 --> 01:20:50,079
- Holy shit!
- Hey, Furby!

1366
01:20:53,447 --> 01:20:54,913
Holy shit!

1367
01:20:54,915 --> 01:20:56,351
Wanna go to Mars?

1368
01:20:57,285 --> 01:20:58,417
Welcome back!

1369
01:20:58,419 --> 01:21:00,220
Dude,
this place is awesome.

1370
01:21:00,222 --> 01:21:01,290
Oh, here they come.

1371
01:21:03,624 --> 01:21:04,625
Veeves.

1372
01:21:07,661 --> 01:21:09,561
Mom?

1373
01:21:09,563 --> 01:21:10,566
Daddy!

1374
01:21:16,303 --> 01:21:17,636
Yeah.

1375
01:21:17,638 --> 01:21:19,173
We got a lot to talk about.

1376
01:21:20,674 --> 01:21:22,108
What the heck
is this place?

1377
01:21:22,110 --> 01:21:25,545
Well, it's not quite home,
but at least we're all together.

1378
01:21:25,547 --> 01:21:28,314
Together? Like...
together-together?

1379
01:21:28,316 --> 01:21:29,649
Let's get you guys
dried off.

1380
01:21:29,651 --> 01:21:33,519
No, goof.
Come on, I'll show you around.

1381
01:21:33,521 --> 01:21:36,692
A lot has changed but we're
kind of a big deal around here.
