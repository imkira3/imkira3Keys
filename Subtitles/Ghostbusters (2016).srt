00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:16,767
So, the Aldridge Mansion is the only
19th century home in New York City

3
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,281
preserved both inside and out.

4
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,930
At the time of its construction,

5
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,321
it was one of the most
elegant homes in existence.

6
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:27,560
Interesting fact.
This grandfather clock was on the Titanic

7
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,722
and was saved by Sir Aldridge.

8
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,209
A Romanian woman and her child were
forced to leave the lifeboat to make room.

9
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,243
Over here,

10
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,609
you can imagine Sir Aldridge
entertaining his wealthy guests.

11
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,811
It's said that, in this very room, P.T. Barnum
first had the idea to enslave elephants.

12
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,210
And if you'll follow me...

13
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,043
Now, I'm gonna tell you
something a little spooky.

14
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:02,805
On the morning of October 25th, 1894,
Sir Aldridge awoke, furious,

15
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,848
when his breakfast was not waiting for him.

16
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,766
So he called to his servants,
but none of them responded.

17
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,646
Why?

18
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,851
Because, during the night, one by one,

19
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,367
they had each been stabbed to death
in their sleep.

20
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,330
It was later discovered

21
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,121
they were murdered by his eldest daughter,

22
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,203
Gertrude Aldridge.

23
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,248
Sir Aldridge once wrote in his diary,

24
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,209
"I know God makes no mistakes,

25
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,888
"but I believe he may have been drunk
when he built Gertrude's personality."

26
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,725
Now, to spare the family public humiliation,

27
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,962
instead of turning her in to the police,

28
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,682
they locked her in this basement.

29
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,645
And they fed her

30
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,725
through this slot.

31
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,486
Years later, when a new owner moved in,

32
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,722
they dug out her remains.

33
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,925
But, after repeatedly hearing strange sounds,

34
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,044
he sealed it shut.

35
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:07,324
That's right.
No one has opened this door since then.

36
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,531
Okay.

37
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,726
Follow me.

38
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,683
Maybe steer clear of the door.

39
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,401
Sorry, Sir Aldridge.
I got to get out of here!

40
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,170
Garret, you idiot.

41
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,926
No.

42
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,084
No.

43
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,881
No! No! No!

44
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,205
No! No!

45
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,284
No!

46
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,250
Daniel. Teresa.

47
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,842
Dr. Roberts. Robert, hello.

48
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,288
- Erin, sweetheart. Hi.
- Hello, Phil.

49
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,084
- Good morning, Jack.
- Hi.

50
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,801
- Did you hear the news?
- Tell me.

51
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,201
I'm lecturing in the big hall today.

52
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,362
- Darling, that's wonderful.
- I know.

53
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,523
- This is what you're wearing?
- What?

54
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,841
I have someone I want you to meet.

55
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,208
Phyllis, I would like
to introduce Erin Gilbert.

56
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,602
She specializes in
theoretical particle physics.

57
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,523
I'm a huge fan.

58
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,204
This is such an honor to meet you.

59
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,966
Phyllis is guest lecturing
in Daniels' astrophysics and cosmology.

60
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,124
Erin just learned she's being published.

61
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,648
Yes, well, I'm very proud.

62
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,485
I don't allow my lab
to submit to journals anymore.

63
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,122
I think journals tamper with the process
and ultimately hurt scientific research.

64
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,888
Yeah. It's like when scientists get caught up,
you know, in those dumb awards.

65
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,566
- You know...
- Awards are massively important.

66
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,450
Yes, no, I was saying
it'd be dumb not to go after awards,

67
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,602
'cause that's where science really shines.

68
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,810
It's, unfortunately, the only way
to draw attention to good science.

69
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,331
Excellent point.

70
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,643
All right. I should be going.

71
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,721
Hey, Simon.

72
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,005
Well, I'm going to lecture right now

73
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,040
in the big hall.

74
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:56,170
It's good that it's big, too, 'cause I've got
a lot of big ideas I'm going to be spreading.

75
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,562
Hey, good luck on your tenure review.
Make me proud.

76
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,241
Fingers crossed.

77
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,926
Not that crossing your fingers
means anything, 'cause it doesn't.

78
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,889
I couldn't disagree more.

79
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:10,363
It's been proven that superstitions
can have tremendous performance benefits.

80
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,206
Exactly. I'm wrong about everything.

81
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,128
All right. Well, I'm gonna try to get out
of here without stepping on these cracks.

82
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,885
I don't want my mom calling me, like...

83
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,011
See, when they change direction,
you've got to...

84
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,969
So, you know her?

85
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,008
Ding dong.

86
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,081
Yeah.

87
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,528
Sean, that is an excellent question.

88
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,967
As you can see from my calculations,

89
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:39,365
we will soon be able to combine
general relativity and quantum theory.

90
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,242
Teaching in the big hall. Big day.

91
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,730
Big hall. Big hall. Big hall!

92
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,006
Big hall!

93
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,210
Sorry to interrupt, but I need to speak
to you about something you wrote.

94
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,407
I'm sorry. Yes. What...

95
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,847
What publication?

96
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,240
I'm talking about your book.

97
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,041
Book.

98
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,403
I'm sorry, I don't know what you mean.

99
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,482
Now, if you'll excuse me,
my class will be here any minute.

100
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,005
You're Erin Gilbert, right?

101
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,485
Co-author of Ghosts from Our Past:

102
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,166
Both Literally and Figuratively:
The Study of the Paranormal?

103
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,650
I think you're looking
for a different Erin Gilbert.

104
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,326
One that likes very long titles.

105
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,450
Okay. But this really does look like you.

106
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,731
What? No.

107
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,160
Yeah, that's me.

108
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,810
Look, it was a very long time ago,

109
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,087
and it was just a gag
between a couple of friends.

110
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,486
I'm sorry.

111
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,528
A 460-page gag?

112
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,931
The first sentence is, "This is not a joke."

113
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,366
What do you want?

114
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,680
Well, I'm Ed Mulgrave.

115
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,969
I'm the historian at the Aldridge Mansion,
and I believe it's haunted.

116
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,690
If you could just come take a look.

117
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,570
I tried the police, but I just sound crazy.

118
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,883
I'm sorry.
That book you're holding is utter nonsense.

119
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,841
I don't even know how you got that.
I thought I burned both copies.

120
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,922
It's on Amazon. Both hard copy and e-book.

121
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,527
- What?
- It's on Books on Tape, too.

122
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,045
Only, I know how to read.

123
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,647
Is it now?

124
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,487
No!

125
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,484
No, no, no, no, no. I'm gonna kill you, Abby.

126
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,041
Erin.

127
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,327
Hi! Dr. Filmore. Hello, hi.

128
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,643
We're set for the final review
of your tenure case on Thursday.

129
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,207
Great.

130
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,886
But I saw that you had
a recommendation letter

131
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,764
from Dr. Branum at Princeton.

132
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,088
Their science department
is really not what it used to be.

133
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,370
And I would consider getting a referral
from a more prestigious college.

134
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,249
More prestigious than Princeton?

135
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,721
Yes.

136
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,084
You see, I think you're an asset
to modern physics,

137
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,164
but I would hate to see you
throw it down the drain.

138
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,722
No. No, no, no, sir.
I won't throw it down the drain.

139
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,450
And I will get on that letter.

140
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:56,481
Yes. Princeton.
More like Prince-tons of dummies go there.

141
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,605
About your clothes...

142
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,444
Yes? Did you...

143
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,130
Too sexy for academia?

144
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,641
Never mind.

145
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,840
No, no, no. What is it?

146
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,004
- Never mind!
- I don't...

147
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,051
Abby. You promised you wouldn't do this.

148
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,640
"Abigail continues her passion
for the study of the paranormal

149
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,247
"at the Kenneth P. Higgins
Institute of Science."

150
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,765
Come on, F7!

151
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,407
Are you kidding me?

152
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,721
Hello?

153
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,643
I've been waiting a long time.

154
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,089
Has been a while, hasn't it?

155
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,206
Hope you brought me more than one wonton.

156
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,286
Excuse me?

157
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,489
Well, well, well.

158
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,121
Erin.

159
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,726
Abby.

160
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,607
Bennie.

161
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,445
Yes, I know who you are, Bennie.
Can I just...

162
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,923
Can I have my lunch
that I've been waiting an hour for?

163
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,968
You know they make
smaller headphones now, right?

164
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,605
It's an advance in science.

165
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,410
Thank you for asking.

166
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,369
Probably the future you're looking at.

167
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,561
Here you go.

168
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,211
Why don't you show Miss Gilbert to the door.

169
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,089
It's just the same door we came in from.

170
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,049
- Yeah, I know how to get out. It's figurative.
- It's really not that hard.

171
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,450
- No, I'm okay.
- Don't.

172
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,405
- I tried.
- Poorly.

173
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,645
You put our book online
without my permission.

174
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,411
I don't need your permission.

175
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,761
Of course you need my permission.
I wrote that book with you.

176
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,046
My name is on it.

177
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,248
No. Absolutely not.

178
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,761
That book is a whole new
revenue stream for me.

179
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,764
And I'm, like, one-tenth away from
getting a new mini fridge in here.

180
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,285
Look, I am up for tenure right now.

181
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,691
"I'm up for tenure."

182
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,726
And if my colleagues at Columbia University
google my name,

183
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,609
that is the first thing that comes up.

184
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,001
Along with a ghost emoji now,
thank you very much,

185
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,161
- that does a little dance.
- You know what?

186
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,049
That book was our baby.

187
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,647
And you abandoned that baby
before it even learned to fly!

188
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,610
Okay, well, books can't fly.
And neither can babies, so...

189
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,330
You don't know. I'll tell you what.

190
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,291
If I had a human baby that could fly,
I wouldn't be telling the press about it.

191
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,762
If I had a flying baby,
I'd zip this, and so would you.

192
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,525
There is no experimental backing
for anything in that book.

193
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,682
And it makes me look like a crazy person.

194
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,206
- God! Are you kidding me?
- What?

195
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,328
I got one wonton!

196
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:43,325
I got a tub of soup,
and I got one split wonton.

197
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,164
Look at that, just floating there.

198
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,369
I'm sorry you're having
a soup crisis right now.

199
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,920
There's not even any meat in there.
That's just a carrot.

200
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,286
Abby, please.

201
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,090
- Yes.
- Abby!

202
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,161
I got one wonton!

203
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,561
What do I have to do?

204
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:59,087
I will take my top off for Bennie
if it gets me three more wontons.

205
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,731
I swear to God.

206
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,640
You carry a lot of tension in your shoulders.

207
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,687
I'm sorry, hello? Who are you?

208
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,649
Holtzmann. Virgo.

209
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,848
Avid skier. Gluten-full.

210
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,811
And 100% jazzed to meet you.

211
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,642
Don't get too close to her, Holtzmann.

212
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,007
She'll ask you to write a book,
and then she'll squash your dreams.

213
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,127
Okay.

214
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,486
Holtzmann works with me here in the lab.

215
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:27,042
She's a brilliant engineer and very loyal.

216
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,003
She would not abandon you.

217
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,451
I get it.

218
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,330
She also happens to specialize in
experimental particle physics.

219
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,442
- She was almost hired by CERN.
- That's very impressive.

220
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,170
What happened?

221
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,766
- There was a lab incident.
- But he's gonna wake up.

222
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,769
- He woke up yesterday.
- Great.

223
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,842
Then he screamed
and went back into a coma.

224
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,843
Well, I bet all that screaming
tuckered him out.

225
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,446
Can we get back to our discussion please?

226
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:54,161
Gosh, it sounds like a great time,
but I'm gonna have to say no

227
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,322
because Holtzmann and I are really busy here

228
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,768
actualizing what we just
theorized about in our book.

229
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,887
- Really?
- Yeah.

230
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:04,487
We're incredibly close on the hollow laser
for the reverse tractor beam.

231
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,800
Really close.

232
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,370
You're making a reverse tractor beam?

233
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,364
Abby, why don't you let her listen
to the EVP.

234
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,488
- What EVP?
- No. Not... There's no EVP.

235
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,086
- EVP is electro...
- Electro voice phenomenon.

236
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,764
I'm familiar. I know what it means.

237
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,366
And there's never been one substantiated.

238
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,329
There hasn't? There hasn't been one...

239
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,845
You know what? You come with me.

240
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,048
With a suit on and you get so cocky.

241
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,961
A few months ago, we spent eight nights
at the Chelsea Hotel.

242
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,201
We didn't get anything.

243
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,210
Well, we didn't think so.

244
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:37,126
And then later, in the lab, when we were
reviewing these tapes...

245
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,891
- You really got me.
- You know what?

246
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,405
Usually we can't even get people over here.

247
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,369
- But we have never...
- She came right over to it.

248
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,250
Never had anybody actually
put their face down close to the machine.

249
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,244
It's a cool joke. That was funny.
It's disgusting.

250
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,721
Is it more or less disgusting
if I tell you it came from the front?

251
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,451
- You didn't...
- I can do it live if you want.

252
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,049
What's next? You gonna give me a wedgie?

253
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,444
No. I think both of us pretty much feel
you have enough stuck up your butt.

254
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,887
Burn!

255
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,761
Okay, you know what, I thought
we could have an adult conversation,

256
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,604
but apparently we can't.

257
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,001
Erin, if you don't believe
in this stuff anymore,

258
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,082
then why were you looking for the book?

259
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:27,165
A man came to see me at my work
saying his building was haunted.

260
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,767
What building?

261
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,444
The Aldridge Mansion.

262
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,602
It's obviously a joke.

263
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,365
What are you doing?

264
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,561
See, this is, this is exactly...

265
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,529
- You want to go find some ghosts?
- Yes.

266
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,047
Break!

267
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,168
- Wait, you're going?
- I got the pack.

268
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,804
Abby! Please, Abby. The book.

269
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,723
Come on. Let's go!

270
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,131
I'm not going with you guys.

271
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,804
No. Are you kidding?

272
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,245
You were never invited!

273
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,687
I need you out of the lab,
so I can lock the door.

274
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,091
Well, you said "let's," so...

275
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,571
- Oh, my God. Just pull the...
- We're wasting time.

276
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,130
Just close the door behind you, it'll lock!

277
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,486
Abby, wait!

278
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,525
Hey! Taxi!

279
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,491
- Hey! Hey!
- Abby.

280
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,005
Abby, come on.

281
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,082
Please, Abby, just
take the book down. Please.

282
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,885
All right, all right,

283
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:19,203
but you have to introduce us
to this guy at the Aldridge Mansion.

284
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,486
Yes, he would love to meet you.

285
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,801
Then I will consider, maybe,

286
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,929
taking the book down
until you get your stupid tenure

287
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,365
at your stupider college.

288
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,727
Absolutely. Yes, I will. Yes, of course!

289
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,321
You got it?

290
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,163
Excuse me! Excuse me!

291
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,686
We're not open.

292
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,524
- Can I help you?
- Yes. Hi.

293
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,931
We're looking for Ed Mulgrave.

294
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,685
- I wanted to introduce these people to him.
- Hi there.

295
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,524
He came to see me this morning.

296
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,489
- Ed Mulgrave?
- Yes.

297
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,131
But Ed Mulgrave died 15 years ago.

298
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,004
- Yes! That's awesome!
- What?

299
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,684
Dead for 15 years!

300
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,922
Ed's a ghost! Knew it!

301
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,566
I just saw him today...

302
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,601
He's...

303
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,161
So, who is this?

304
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,368
That's Ed's son. Ed Junior.

305
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,169
Okay. That's obviously who I meant. That's...

306
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,768
Hi, Junior. If I may, when is the last time
the paranormal entity was actually seen?

307
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:16,811
And if you were to rank it, let's say between
probably a T1 and T5...

308
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,043
Garret here saw it on Tuesday,
and I believe it made him soil himself.

309
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,168
- Jesus.
- Wow. Soiling.

310
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,004
I'd put that at a T3.

311
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,606
T4, if it was poop.

312
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,125
- What?
- Unless you ate something weird.

313
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,406
Then it wasn't the ghost.

314
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,608
Kinda hard to suss that out
after the fact though.

315
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,920
I didn't soil myself.

316
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,844
He did. He called me sobbing, saying,
"Oh, my God, my pants are toast."

317
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,366
Did you happen to keep
a sample of the soiling?

318
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,441
A sample?

319
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,443
- Okay. All right.
- I'd love to get that back to the lab.

320
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,251
Well, so I have made the introduction.

321
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,765
- Yeah, thank you.
- There you go.

322
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,683
All right, well, how 'bout
you take us across the street.

323
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,331
I got to get in there, set up.
Let's go on a tour.

324
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,011
You're gonna die in there.

325
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,251
Aldridge Mansion. Take one.

326
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,129
And we are rolling.

327
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,168
Checking the settings. We look good.

328
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,207
What is that?

329
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:03,045
Looks like one of those things
that makes cotton candy.

330
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,009
It's a PKE meter.

331
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,888
There's a ghost anywhere around here,
this baby's gonna find it.

332
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,326
Does it work?

333
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,681
Yeah, it works.

334
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:16,446
I just haven't had the appropriate proximity
to an entity for it to work.

335
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,010
Strange reading here.

336
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,131
Ma'am, can you tell us where you got
the world's tiniest bow tie?

337
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,364
It came with the shirt.

338
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,082
Okay, somebody really doesn't
want us getting in that door.

339
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,521
Can you tell us what it's like
to walk around in those shoes all day?

340
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,768
- It's not fun.
- All right.

341
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,120
Holtzmann, check this out.

342
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,361
Hold your ponies.

343
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,965
All right. Good gag.

344
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,565
Hey, are you getting that?

345
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,687
Very funny.

346
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,684
Is everything a joke to you guys?

347
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,001
Just your mama.

348
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,242
No, actually, I think the world of your mom.

349
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,322
You guys put all that
gooey stuff on the floor.

350
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,281
You opened the basement door.
You tried to freak me out.

351
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,970
We did not open the basement door...

352
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,247
Basement door is open.

353
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,841
- I didn't open it. Did you open it?
- I did not open it.

354
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,044
You know what, it was probably Ed.
And the guy who didn't poop his pants.

355
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,806
Look over there.

356
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,844
I didn't even know it did that.

357
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,843
- I... My ears just...
- Mine just popped, too.

358
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,921
That is definitely...

359
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,684
- An AP-xH shift. Yes!
- Shift.

360
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,240
- I mean, for sure. That's...
- Guys?

361
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,564
I don't think we're alone.

362
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,880
Holy crap.

363
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,445
Let me have the camera. Thank you.

364
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,601
Okay.

365
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,844
How can you be eating right now?

366
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,331
Once you pop...

367
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,569
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

368
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,484
Good God.

369
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,244
Class 4 apparition.

370
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,845
Distinct human form.

371
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,809
This can't be happening.

372
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,484
It's happening, all right.

373
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,449
That's the most beautiful thing
I have ever seen.

374
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,651
I'm gonna try to talk to it.

375
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,561
Just be careful, she could be malevolent.

376
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,529
Yeah, just make sure you're recording it.

377
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,125
- Yeah, I'm getting it all.
- Okay.

378
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,531
Just be cautious.

379
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,047
I think she wants to communicate with us.

380
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,406
I knew it, I knew it, I knew it.

381
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,009
It's okay. She seems peaceful.

382
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,691
Hello.

383
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,605
I think you're gorgeous.

384
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,566
Hello. Hi.

385
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:54,763
My name is Erin Gilbert,
Doctor of Particle Physics at Columbia...

386
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,444
- Yes!
- God!

387
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,760
She's getting away! Come on!

388
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,089
- Hurry, hurry!
- Run!

389
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,650
- Get it, get it!
- Where'd it go? Where'd it go?

390
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,044
- Where'd it go? Where'd it go?
- There!

391
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,045
What just happened?

392
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,690
Abby, what just happened?

393
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,686
I'll tell you what just happened.
We saw a ghost.

394
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,966
- We saw a ghost!
- Yeah, we saw a ghost!

395
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,690
We saw a ghost! Oh, my God!

396
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,285
- We saw a ghost.
- We saw a ghost!

397
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,649
Oh, my God, we saw a ghost!

398
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,209
We were right! We weren't crazy!

399
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,645
We saw a ghost!

400
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,529
Ghosts are real! Ghosts are real!

401
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,171
I believe in ghosts 'cause I just saw one!
They're real!

402
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,330
Who is that?

403
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,323
Dr. Bronstein saw this on Reddit.

404
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,643
It was re-blogged
from a site entitled Ghost News.

405
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,242
Not a publication I'd heard of.

406
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:06,085
I hope you understand that
when we give someone tenure...

407
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,890
I accept your tenure.

408
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,806
When we give someone tenure,
they represent this institution.

409
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,522
But this is just not
what this institution is about.

410
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,561
Dr. Gibbons.

411
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,848
Found mold in my office, so I gotta move.

412
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,685
Don't tell anyone.
I don't want people to panic or anything.

413
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,966
Kids, hello.

414
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,442
I didn't get fired. Even though
I have the old plant in the box.

415
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,285
Margaret, hi.
Just taking my plant out for some air.

416
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,883
Just like to carry it in this box
with all my other personal stuff.

417
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,322
Phil. Phil. Hi. Phil...

418
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,051
If you turn around, you'll see me.
I'm right behind you.

419
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,963
Yeah. He's looking at that chart.

420
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,926
Couldn't figure that out, either.
Call me when you figure that out.

421
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,570
Haven't been able to.

422
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,886
Samantha. Hi. How are you?

423
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:55,362
Sixty. Seventy.

424
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,522
Sometimes, I like to
put all my stuff from my office in a box

425
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,809
and just do some exercises
and just use it as weights. Eighty.

426
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,807
Well, I hope you're happy.

427
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,131
That video you posted got me fired.

428
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,801
Fired!

429
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:15,165
- No! God, no! We will all die.
- Turn to ash from the inside out.

430
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,522
- What?
- Put it down. Carefully.

431
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,728
- Put it... Put it down... Oh, my God.
- Fired!

432
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,962
After years,

433
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,801
years of hard work.

434
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,120
And ass-kissing.

435
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,248
God, I kissed so many
different kinds of asses.

436
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,483
Erin, we're sorry that you lost your job.

437
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:36,325
But, I mean, there is
kind of a glass is half full aspect of it.

438
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,528
I mean, we saw a real ghost.

439
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,090
You know, and she was beautiful.

440
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,170
Till she dislocated her jaw
and ecto-projected all over you.

441
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,846
Yeah, that stuff went everywhere,
by the way, in every crack.

442
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:50,323
But, I got to say, even that was
kind of spectacularly beautiful.

443
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,522
I did detect a heavy ionization discharge.

444
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,601
I mean, I could smell it.

445
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:59,571
A full-torso transmogrification
with corporeal aggression.

446
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,529
I mean, how often does that happen?

447
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,443
I mean, they want us to be quiet about that?

448
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,409
We are not gonna be quiet about that.

449
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,689
And it's not just us.
We have over 100 comments already.

450
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,131
And they're not all crazies.

451
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,611
Come here, I want to show you this.

452
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,045
Read that.

453
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,726
"Ain't no bitches gonna hunt no ghosts."

454
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,370
No, no. Okay.

455
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,090
The one below it.

456
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:24,767
This woman is describing
a Class 3 haunting in her house.

457
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,207
She can't just move.
She can't call the police.

458
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,089
She can't call her friends.
Who's she gonna call?

459
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,162
Ghost Jumpers!

460
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,681
Tonight, the Ghost Jumpers
make contact with the ghost of Bigfoot.

461
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,728
God! These phonies!

462
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,040
I mean, you know what?

463
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,722
These guys are the reason you got fired.

464
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:43,885
It's because of stuff like this that makes it
impossible for us to do our real work.

465
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,731
This cannot be the best option for people.

466
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,963
Okay, we are on the cusp of something here,
a real discovery.

467
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:54,771
Unlike Columbia,
this institute is 100% behind us.

468
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,921
Really?

469
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,244
Erin, this is what we have dreamed about
since we were little kids.

470
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:04,843
I know that if you come and join us here,
they are gonna be so pumped.

471
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,446
We just have to go upstairs
and ask for more money.

472
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,490
I just honestly didn't realize
your department still existed.

473
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:13,086
- What?
- Come on, ghosts?

474
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:18,451
I will not let the 12-year reputation of
this fine institution be besmirched by you!

475
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:22,561
Come on! Suddenly this place
has a classy reputation to uphold?

476
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,450
You're only dean now
because the last dean went to jail.

477
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,329
Are you saying that I'm not qualified?

478
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,607
You spell science with a "Y."

479
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:33,446
And what's upsetting about that is
I don't think you know that that's wrong.

480
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,683
This is an institution of higher learning.

481
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,649
And if you guys want to study "ghosts,"

482
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,281
do it somewhere else,
because I have two words for you.

483
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,805
Let me guess, "Get out"?

484
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,531
- No, he's gonna say "suck it."
- He's not gonna say "suck it."

485
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,171
Suck it.

486
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,806
- You were right.
- You know...

487
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,041
My gosh.

488
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,326
I think it might be a ghost.

489
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,290
No, it's not. It's just a bird.

490
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,691
Bye. There's the door.

491
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,967
Later days. Can you hear this?
Let me turn it up.

492
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,811
Oh, my God.

493
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,407
This is incredibly immature behavior.

494
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,241
Caught it.

495
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,004
Just a minor setback.

496
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,401
You know what, guys?
I think we can really do this.

497
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,643
We can become the first scientists to prove
the existence of the paranormal.

498
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,922
All we have to do is
find an entity and capture it

499
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,004
and bring it into a controlled environment.
That's all!

500
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,609
Hey! There's the Erin I remember.
Welcome back.

501
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,808
- Thank you.
- Nice.

502
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,564
Okay, we should probably
get this equipment out of here.

503
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,768
- They're gonna want it back.
- I thought this stuff was yours.

504
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,966
- All stolen.
- No...

505
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,327
Hey! That worthless garbage
belongs to this school!

506
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,290
Scatter! Scatter! Scatter!

507
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,285
Go, go, go, scatter!

508
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,047
Hey. Good morning.

509
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,451
Okay.

510
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,207
Hey, how you doing, sir? Got a Metro...

511
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,523
Hey. That's a dope jacket, man.
I got that jacket.

512
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,887
You know what? It's a sweater.
I made a mistake.

513
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,291
You have a good day, all right?

514
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,204
Hey! How you doing, man?

515
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,850
They'll always ignore you.

516
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:09,847
They are walking sewage, concerned
only with their own trivial matters.

517
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,201
Okay.

518
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,611
When the Fourth Cataclysm begins,

519
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:16,730
laborers, such as yourself,
will be among the last led to the butchery.

520
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,007
So, make the most of your extra time.

521
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:23,121
You are just a bundle of joy, ain't ya?

522
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,646
You have a good day with your crazy ass.

523
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,290
I wonder what train he taking.

524
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,289
Is he going on the tracks?

525
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,841
Man...

526
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,362
You want to use the bathroom,

527
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,683
there's a perfectly nice bathroom
upstairs at Starbucks.

528
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,251
Hey, hey!

529
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,402
Hey, you're not supposed to be
down here, man. Only subway...

530
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,441
What in the sweet hell?

531
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,920
Exquisite.

532
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,562
I'm cool, dude. Yeah.

533
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,881
Forget this, man!

534
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,201
Forget this!

535
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,407
Aldridge Mansion? Check.

536
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,162
Seward Street subway station?

537
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,321
Check.

538
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,530
Well done, Rowan.

539
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,768
But still so many more checks to go.

540
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,730
You have been bullied your entire life.

541
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,602
Now you will be the bully.

542
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:21,125
Trust in your abilities,

543
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,807
and the universe shall bend before your will.

544
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,681
Hey, weirdo.
We got a clogged toilet in 1843. It's bad.

545
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,922
I mean, like, biblically bad. Get on it.

546
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,681
Absolutely.

547
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,603
Nothing would make me happier.

548
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,923
Whatever, freak show. Just do it.

549
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:44,209
And the universe shall bend before your will.

550
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,849
Charge the lines.

551
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,321
Create the vortex.

552
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,121
Break the barrier.

553
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,891
I found a fantastic spot for your business.

554
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,291
It's more of a research lab.

555
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,248
- What do you think?
- That's it?

556
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,885
Let's go see your new home.

557
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,801
- Oh, my God! Look at...
- Look at it!

558
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,769
- Look at how high!
- Look at the amazing spread!

559
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,490
Look at the ceiling to the floor height!

560
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,249
Look at this. Look at it.

561
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,761
It's perfect.

562
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,569
- We got tons of space.
- Stripper pole!

563
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,210
- We'll take it.
- Great.

564
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,931
- The rent is $21,000 a month.
- Fuck you.

565
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,651
- Excuse me?
- I'm sorry. That's the rent?

566
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,563
- Yeah.
- Who can afford that?

567
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,971
All your friend said was that

568
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,281
you were looking for a place
to explore the unknown.

569
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,089
Okay, we need to explore
something a lot cheaper.

570
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,361
There's an upstairs!

571
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,408
Are you offended by the smell
of Chinese food?

572
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,721
I have now moved above you,
and you still can't help me out.

573
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:43,043
How does it take you an hour
to go up one flight of stairs?

574
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,451
I have really bad knees.

575
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,926
You know what?

576
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,527
What is that?

577
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,523
It's our hot and sour shrimp soup.

578
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,207
That looks like dishwater and one shrimp,
and I think it's...

579
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,169
I hope that's a water chestnut.

580
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,524
We're dancing? Okay.

581
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,200
Let's be safe, though.

582
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,970
Holtz. Holtz. Holtzmann!

583
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,451
Fire!

584
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,970
Over towards the fire.

585
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,767
Thank you.

586
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,811
I hate to DeBarge in.

587
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,563
- She loves that.
- Is that by DeBarge?

588
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,766
I thought it was Devo.

589
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,047
Anyway, I got the website up.

590
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,043
I passed out a bunch of these fliers
all over town,

591
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,929
so I'm drumming us up a little business.

592
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,004
"If you see something, say something."

593
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,730
- It's catchy.
- It's good.

594
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:56,009
- Yeah, I'll take it.
- I think it might be the anti-terrorism slogan.

595
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,491
God.

596
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,122
- It is, isn't it?
- It is. I'm sorry.

597
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,282
Well, I guess now we know
why so many people are calling

598
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,488
about suspicious-looking bags.

599
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,446
Dang it.

600
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,522
- I love the green paper!
- Thank you.

601
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:13,681
Hey. I'm here about the receptionist job.

602
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,322
- Hi. Hi.
- Hi.

603
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,244
Is this a big ol' robot?

604
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,846
What?

605
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,764
The receptionist job that was in the paper.
That's what I was here about.

606
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,205
You're hired.

607
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,967
Okay, I... God, you're all sweaty.

608
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,646
I think I got it.
"If there's something strange in the..."

609
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,041
Kevin. Right?

610
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,121
- Kevin.
- Yeah.

611
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,565
Abby. We spoke on the phone.

612
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,766
- We did. Yeah.
- Hello there.

613
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,080
- Okay.
- Kevin.

614
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,884
That's a manly name.

615
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,406
My name's Erin. With an "E."

616
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,687
For "everything you want."

617
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,042
Okay. Well, we should probably...

618
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,166
Should probably get started.

619
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,163
Erin? Do you want to join us?

620
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,641
- Yes.
- Erin.

621
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,165
I've got some questions.

622
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,522
Okay. Here we go.

623
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,285
Let me just get to my notes.

624
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,366
Okay.

625
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,408
All right, first off, I just want to say...

626
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:14,086
You know, we should probably start with
a very important question

627
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:17,721
that we're asking all of the applicants.

628
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,326
You know, are you seeing anyone right now?

629
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,567
- Seeing anyone?
- Yeah.

630
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,086
- Just for business purposes.
- Business purposes only.

631
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,966
Well, I'm seeing all three of you.

632
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,486
In front of me.

633
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:34,690
Just forget she even asked, because
if she did, that would be illegal, so...

634
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,001
Forgotten.

635
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,081
Good.

636
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,128
No, I've forgotten.
I don't know what you asked.

637
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,641
There we go.

638
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,530
Jillian Holtzmann, Radio Times.

639
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,321
What have you been doing
with your whole life?

640
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,526
Great question.

641
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,841
Well, lots of different jobs.

642
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,521
I did the "actor thing."

643
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,122
- Worked for...
- I'm just gonna... Just real quick.

644
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,802
Can I ask why no glass?

645
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:02,450
Yeah. They just kept getting dirty,
so I took them out.

646
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,127
- That's...
- Don't have to clean them anymore.

647
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,201
- Oh, boy.
- And I can just...

648
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,282
- I got to try to keep that in mind.
- Yeah.

649
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,727
Would it be okay
if I bring Mike Hat to work sometimes?

650
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,882
He has major anxiety problems.

651
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:15,482
You know what? I would love
to let your cat live here with you,

652
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,881
but I have a pretty severe cat allergy.

653
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,571
No, I don't have a cat.

654
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,211
He's a dog. His name is Mike Hat.

655
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,603
Your dog's name is My Cat?

656
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,170
No, Mike Hat.

657
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,481
Your dog's name is Mike, last name Hat?

658
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,324
Well, his full name is Michael Hat.

659
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:33,087
I can't say that I'm allergic to dogs, so...

660
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,889
It's all right. He lives with my mum.

661
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,008
- Well, then we have that figured out.
- Okay. That was...

662
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,162
One down. No cat.

663
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,641
But you know what I say, let's jump ahead.

664
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,487
Kevin dabbles in web design.

665
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,361
And I asked him to throw together
maybe a couple of logos for us.

666
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,811
- You want to see them?
- Now is your moment.

667
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,086
Pull it out.

668
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,841
Sure.

669
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,600
You're like a lawsuit waiting to happen.

670
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,485
Here we go.

671
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,766
Okay, so...

672
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,930
What do you think of that?

673
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:06,921
Yeah, you do see how this
might make us look bad, right?

674
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,206
Is it the boobs you don't like?
'Cause I can make them bigger.

675
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,964
No, I can see them.

676
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,202
Ghost Tits was my nickname
in middle school.

677
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,327
Right?

678
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,607
You know what? I think
it's not always about the end result.

679
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,091
It's about the journey.

680
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,605
Well, what about this one?

681
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,685
I think that's already a thing.

682
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,807
What, 7-1-1?

683
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,006
It's 7-Eleven.

684
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,491
Yep, it is. I have another option, though.

685
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,050
- Okay, please.
- It's this one.

686
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,241
That's one of my favorites.

687
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:36,125
I think you might've made a mistake.
I don't think that one's for us.

688
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,645
No. No, that's for you.

689
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:41,805
You know, I just thought the floating hot dog
implies that a ghost is holding it.

690
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,765
Your work is more cerebral than I expected.

691
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,321
Still, so many questions about that choice.

692
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:52,007
First one is, why a hot dog?

693
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,083
I just like them.

694
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,722
Both food groups, all in one.

695
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,688
Dogs and buns.

696
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,165
- Those are great.
- Yeah.

697
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:04,483
We're actually gonna
discuss everything just for a second,

698
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,210
so if you could just stand over there,

699
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,169
- we just need to convene for a moment.
- Okay.

700
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,685
- Sure. All right.
- Thank you.

701
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,041
Just go right over there.

702
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,246
Don't listen.

703
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,881
I won't.

704
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,927
He covered his eyes.

705
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,325
Guys, look, as much as
I would like to have him here to look at...

706
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,640
What?

707
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,890
You don't find him attractive?

708
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,527
Kevin?

709
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,650
God, no. Poor guy.

710
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:34,444
- I don't know, guys. I don't know.
- Come on, Erin.

711
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,965
We need help around here.

712
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,769
We cannot keep carrying
that equipment up here.

713
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:41,009
And I know the phones aren't ringing
off the hook right now, but they will be.

714
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,923
You know,
an aquarium is a submarine for fish.

715
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,490
Listen, let's just see
how the rest of the day goes.

716
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:48,849
You know, talk to other people, and we will
hire who is most qualified, okay? Deal?

717
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,161
There are no other people.
He's the only applicant.

718
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,241
Excellent.

719
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,884
God, that's loud.

720
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,610
- It's loud.
- It's loud.

721
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,601
Kevin. You got the job.

722
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,250
- Welcome aboard.
- Cool.

723
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,886
Can I bring my suitcases up?

724
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,291
Yep, you sure can.

725
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,921
Look at him.

726
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,047
Ma'am?

727
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:14,442
Hi, ma'am. If you're waiting for takeout,
you should really wait downstairs.

728
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,286
This... The magazine was here,
so, I don't know,

729
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,488
I just thought that might be
your waiting room.

730
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,767
You know, fun fact about this place,

731
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,411
that this building is built in the same place

732
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:29,007
as the first Chinese gambling den
in New York. Did you know that?

733
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,447
I mean, it's, like, coincidence.

734
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:34,211
Also, I got chased by a ghost.

735
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,561
What?

736
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,405
You know, up above us
was the old New York prison.

737
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:42,563
It's the first place in New York
that they electrocuted people.

738
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,041
I'm telling you, it used to take so long

739
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:48,044
that they'd just be like, "Shoot him.
We using too much electricity."

740
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,561
That's why I knew something weird
was going on down here, man.

741
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,481
Did you see that?

742
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,286
- Yes. I saw that.
- Did you see that?

743
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,249
- That wasn't me.
- I saw that quite a bit.

744
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,087
Wait, wait. Hey! Seriously? For real?

745
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,286
'Ey. Come on, man.

746
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,927
- Didn't I tell you?
- Is he down here all the time?

747
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,128
He think this is his art studio.

748
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,851
No, no. My studio is in SoHo.
This is more of a gallery.

749
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,160
Okay, hello there.

750
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:16,003
Have you seen a Class 4, semi-anchored
entity anywhere in the vicinity?

751
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,162
- You talking like a boat?
- Can you speak English?

752
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,288
- I'm being specifically clear.
- Let me. Let me.

753
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,971
Hi. Have you seen a ghost down here?

754
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,280
- Okay, that's clearer.
- Yeah.

755
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,089
- Yeah, I've seen a ghost.
- You, too?

756
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,127
Yeah.

757
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,844
Would you be able to describe it to us?

758
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,887
- Thank you.
- But...

759
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,406
Come on, man. Come on, man.

760
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,766
No, no, no, no. Let him, let him...

761
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,807
- I'll take a visual.
- No! I can't let him.

762
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,881
This is my job. I'm gonna get fired!

763
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,286
- We want the visual!
- No, no, this is very helpful.

764
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,964
This is not helpful for me.

765
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,088
'Ey. Look at me. Stop.

766
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,523
- Stop painting.
- I'm so sorry.

767
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,647
I don't like this on my wall.

768
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,761
You don't want it here anymore?

769
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,842
- I don't want this ghost on my wall.
- No ghost.

770
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,160
- Let me fix this, then.
- Well, I...

771
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,241
No ghosts allowed.

772
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,765
- You know what? You know what?
- Right?

773
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,080
- Get your ass up out of here.
- Come on.

774
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,286
Bye, Patty!

775
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,805
- I love you.
- Man!

776
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,370
This ain't art!

777
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,086
And y'all encouraging him.

778
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,491
Come on!

779
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,606
Come on!

780
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,246
Am I on crack, or is that a good logo?

781
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,962
Guys, I cannot do it by myself.

782
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,771
This equipment is untested
and highly unstable.

783
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:19,967
All right, ladies, we got a limited window
for when the next train arrives,

784
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,087
I'm telling you.

785
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,321
And don't touch the third rail

786
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,643
unless y'all little dainty ass
can handle 750 volts.

787
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,164
- Come on.
- You know what?

788
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,244
I should've gave you some coveralls, man.
It's so unsanitary down here.

789
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:37,405
You know, you don't usually think about
the amount of urine smell.

790
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:41,002
That's pretty much how it's gonna be.
It's not gonna freshen up at all.

791
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,650
Oh, boy. Okay.

792
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,162
Definitely got something over here.
Look at... Is that...

793
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,366
What is that, a burn?

794
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,090
That's where I saw that weird sparking thing.

795
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,281
What was it?

796
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:52,603
Baby, if I knew what it was,
I wouldn't say "a weird sparking thing."

797
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,802
You're mouthy. I like that.

798
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,047
It looks like fission scorch.

799
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,771
What? Fission scorch down here?

800
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,171
Except that you're right.

801
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,528
What is... Wait, I'm smelling
both electrical discharge

802
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,204
- and isotopic decay.
- Isotopic decay.

803
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,770
How is that... Holtzmann?

804
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,081
- Yeah. What?
- Come here. I need your snoot on this.

805
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:12,961
Am I nuts?

806
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,161
'Ey, 'ey, ladies.

807
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,050
While y'all over there making out
with that dirty piece of garbage,

808
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,849
we only got a couple of minutes.

809
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,240
Do you see that?

810
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,970
- The eyes.
- All right, Holtzmann.

811
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:26,361
- Now is not the time to be messing with...
- No.

812
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,370
Cream and sugar.

813
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:34,291
Hey, Patty, can I get some
illumination on this subject?

814
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,521
Yeah, I can put some light on that.

815
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,091
Oh, boy!

816
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,084
That is more and more unsettling.

817
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,686
That's the dude I saw!
I'm telling you, that's him!

818
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,000
We got another Class 4,

819
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:48,289
and this one's even more ionized
than the one at the Aldridge Mansion.

820
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,362
Where are these ghosts coming from?

821
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,124
You know what?
I got to get this thing on film.

822
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,201
- Holtzmann?
- Yup.

823
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,327
- Power us up.
- Okay.

824
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,767
'Cause we are taking this pretty boy
back to the lab.

825
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,367
This is a little rough.
It's in its early stages. Got to be honest.

826
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,249
Just gonna plug these things in here.

827
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,766
- Okay, Erin, come here.
- Let me document this.

828
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,447
- Grab it, grab it.
- Wait.

829
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,682
That's gonna shoot a proton stream
at that ghost, okay?

830
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,683
So whenever I say, "Go," you just do that.

831
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,888
Why am I operating
the untested nuclear laser?

832
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,485
You have the longest arms.

833
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,891
You guys might want to hurry up.

834
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:18,770
Oh, my God. I forgot the most important part.

835
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,251
Yeah. Sorry.

836
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:23,961
Erin, this is just a little bit of grounding
so you don't die immediately.

837
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,405
Do you know your iron level?

838
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,921
It's fine.

839
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,525
You have done this before, right?

840
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,931
Okay, Erin, on my cue.

841
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,645
Aim the barrel at him.

842
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,407
Ready, aim, fire!

843
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,563
Okay, this is a little underwhelming.
Can we get more power?

844
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,971
And once again, fire!

845
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,170
This isn't working!

846
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,883
Can this beam get any stronger?

847
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,281
Well, not at the moment.

848
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,010
That's the train! We got to move!

849
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,645
Just try to lure him back to the platform!

850
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,201
Grab her!

851
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,921
- Come on!
- Move, move, move!

852
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,001
Come on, move!

853
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:13,127
- Hurry!
- That's the express train!

854
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,770
And it's not stopping!

855
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,045
It's coming! Get her up!

856
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,486
Not the collar!

857
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,247
Well, I guess he going to Queens.

858
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,926
He's gonna be the third scariest thing
on that train.

859
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,002
God, did you see that?

860
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,082
You can't see anything.

861
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,682
My God! I mean,
that power surge really held him.

862
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,765
We need more juice.

863
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,410
We need to be more mobile.
I know what to do.

864
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,811
- Yes.
- I almost got killed.

865
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,450
Yeah, I know. It was so awesome.

866
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,521
It was awesome.

867
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:54,131
Everyone thinks this video is fake.
Look at these comments.

868
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,487
We have to bring a ghost back to this lab
and document it, you guys.

869
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,040
I mean, this stuff is real.
We have to be able to prove it.

870
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,043
We will. And you shouldn't
be reading this stuff.

871
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,963
You're not supposed to listen
to what crazy people write

872
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,201
in the middle of the night online.

873
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,123
Look at...
"Bogus equipment"? You know what?

874
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,601
I'd love you to meet me any place, any time.

875
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,603
No, no, no, let's...
You're right. We should...

876
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:13,160
- Here is your coffee, Abby.
- Thank you.

877
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:15,129
Did you get sugar in it this time?

878
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,166
I hate coffee.

879
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,890
- Yeah, the sugar's in there.
- Sugar's in it.

880
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,527
I'll take it.

881
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:28,206
Don't want to waste a cup of coffee.

882
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:31,491
Can we just pretend
that didn't happen, please?

883
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,642
All right, well, what do you think?

884
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:36,007
I... You know what? I just can't watch that.

885
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,849
I'm not sure.
I mean, it's just a lot of bits and pieces.

886
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,321
I'm pretty sure none of it is
supposed to be in the subway, though.

887
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,846
It's like it was part
of a miniature cyclotron.

888
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:47,241
And they used a chromium alloy for the hull.

889
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,246
I would've used aluminum, but I'm crazy.

890
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,410
What's that weird thing that guy said
to the lady from the subway?

891
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,326
I know what you're talking about.

892
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,323
Fourth Cataclysm. Yeah.

893
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,485
- Hi.
- Fourth Cataclysm.

894
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,166
Man, what they gonna do,
make a fifth one, starring The Rock?

895
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,049
Yeah, you guys, you have a visitor.

896
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,242
She's here to see you in the booth.

897
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:09,322
Booth number one. With the earrings.

898
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,808
- Yeah.
- Yeah. We see her now.

899
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:13,006
- Thanks.
- No worries.

900
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:14,286
I'm joining the club.

901
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,408
Well, it's not really a... I'm sorry.

902
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:20,968
Kevin. Hi, can you answer the phone, please?

903
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,769
- I can't. It's in the fish tank.
- No.

904
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,205
The one on the desk that's ringing. That one.

905
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:25,850
- That one.
- Yep.

906
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,202
- Oh, my God.
- What's this place called again?

907
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:30,601
Conductors of
the Metaphysical Examination. Talk.

908
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:34,002
Got it. Conductors of Metamucils and Stuff.

909
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,962
Slow down. I... What...

910
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:40,521
They hung up?

911
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,648
No, I was just not into that conversation.

912
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:46,486
Kevin, I'm really gonna need you
to try a little harder. Okay, buddy?

913
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,927
Well, if they call back, I will.
I got to take off, though.

914
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:52,010
I'm in a hide-and-seek tournament,
and we are in the semis.

915
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:55,368
Kevin, I'm gonna need you
to pick up all those suitcases.

916
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,125
Did you hurt your face?

917
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:01,443
Hey, did y'all hire that big dumb dude?

918
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:02,601
Bye!

919
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,563
Man, I got a cousin Mookie.

920
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:08,002
He is half as stupid,
and he will work for Vienna sausages.

921
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:12,529
The thing is, this isn't really a club.
It's a scientific research group.

922
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,967
And I understand that,
but let me tell you something.

923
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,648
I read a lot of nonfiction,

924
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:20,485
and you guys know
a lot about this science stuff,

925
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:21,607
but I know New York.

926
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,409
And check this out!

927
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,721
I can borrow a car from my uncle,

928
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:28,047
and y'all won't have to lug
all this heavy equipment around.

929
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,083
- Guys, we got to get a car.
- Come on, baby.

930
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:33,607
You need me. You need Patty.
Patty come with benefits. You need me.

931
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,250
Stop playing like you don't.

932
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:36,401
You're in.

933
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:41,361
Yeah.

934
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:45,525
You get a car,
and you get a car, and you get a car!

935
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:50,081
You didn't disclose
that the vehicle was gonna be a hearse.

936
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:54,131
I'm sorry. My uncle owns a funeral home,
not a Enterprise Rent-A-Car.

937
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:56,328
Hope you checked to see
there wasn't a body in the back.

938
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:59,562
I don't think so. I don't really know.

939
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:00,846
You didn't check?

940
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:02,046
I mean, I was in a hurry.

941
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:04,885
I checked to see if we had gas.
That was more important.

942
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,007
So there is a body?

943
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:08,287
Let Holtzmann check.
She likes that type of stuff.

944
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:11,523
Yeah, I can think of seven good uses
of a cadaver today.

945
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,284
No, Dr. Frankenstein,

946
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:15,806
we got to turn in the body
if there's one in there.

947
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:18,487
- All right.
- Don't do that.

948
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:25,730
- Excuse me, maintenance man.
- Mrs. Ponner.

949
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:26,961
How may I help you?

950
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:31,807
Well, for starters, perhaps you can tell me
what in God's name this is?

951
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:35,769
Mrs. Ponner, this is nothing more than
some leakage from our air conditioning.

952
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:39,244
Well, I think it's touched my skin,
and it's given me a rash.

953
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:40,891
Does it look right?

954
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:46,762
Mrs. Ponner, I wanted to say no.

955
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:50,282
But, yes, I'm afraid there is some redness

956
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:51,841
in here.

957
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:54,122
- Is it very bad?
- No.

958
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,131
Of course not, Mrs. Ponner.

959
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:58,965
But I assure you,
whoever is responsible for this

960
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:03,406
will be flogged within an inch of their life
and then left on the street to die like a pig.

961
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:07,805
- Well, I didn't ask for that.
- Well, in that case, I'll send up some cream.

962
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:24,130
I know everyone is anxious,
but we have to be patient.

963
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:28,405
Who thought it would be funny
to put Earl in that old lady's back?

964
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:34,050
The guests are starting to complain.

965
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:37,721
And we don't want to give away any spoilers
before the big show.

966
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:40,927
See you soon.

967
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,569
Very soon.

968
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:46,246
Based on the results
of the subway field test...

969
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:47,890
The one where you were
almost killed, remember?

970
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:49,041
I remember.

971
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:53,569
I added a booster using microfabricated
radio-frequency quadrupoles

972
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:56,445
to speed up particles
before entering the DLA device,

973
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:59,288
portable, wearable for maximum flexibility.

974
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,571
Then we add the reversible
psychokinetic energy sync

975
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:05,689
plus Holtzy's hollow beam to this baby,
and voilà.

976
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:06,966
We got a ghost in there.

977
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:09,562
- Slap me.
- Okay.

978
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:11,085
I will slap you as...

979
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:13,244
I just want to say
what an exciting moment this is.

980
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:15,243
Holtzmann, I am beyond impressed.

981
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:16,924
Abby, is that comfortable?

982
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,048
It's a lot heavier than I expected,

983
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:21,885
and I'm pretty sure
it's compacting my spinal column, but...

984
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,082
- So you're gonna want to plant your feet firm.
- Okay.

985
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,606
Bend your knees
to compensate for the extra kickback.

986
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:28,887
All right. Turning the machine on.

987
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,567
Boy, she's got an impressive purr.

988
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:36,604
Okay, so, that little asshole over there
is the target.

989
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:37,727
Okay.

990
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:40,246
Just put your thumb
on that red trigger button there.

991
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:41,970
- Yeah.
- And go to town.

992
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:43,041
Okay.

993
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,081
And here we go!

994
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:53,483
I guess she's not
bending her knees enough, right?

995
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:57,883
She's doing a marvelous impression
of a deflating balloon.

996
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:00,440
We just got to let her ride it out
until she's out of juice.

997
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,284
She's corkscrewing me!

998
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:04,089
Abby, I'll make some adjustments.

999
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,491
It's like fighting a gator!

1000
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:13,490
Looking forward to this metal show.

1001
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,161
Hi.

1002
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:17,201
Ozzy rocks!

1003
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:19,721
Yeah!

1004
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,165
It's...

1005
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:22,924
He certainly does rock.

1006
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:28,041
This world cannot be cleansed fast enough.

1007
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:29,761
Hi.

1008
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,001
Enjoy the show.

1009
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:33,041
Rock and roll.

1010
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,288
So, how did the two of you guys meet?

1011
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:41,525
Abby transferred
to my high school, junior year.

1012
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:43,090
Go, Karate Cats.

1013
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:47,006
We started telling ghost stories,
and we just kind of bonded right away.

1014
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:49,845
And all the other kids were, you know,
getting drunk and going to parties,

1015
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,888
and we're like, "That's stupid."

1016
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:54,890
Plus, we weren't invited to any parties.

1017
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:56,967
You know what? You know what I thought...

1018
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,122
I'm not gonna tell you.
I'm just gonna show you. You'll see.

1019
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:02,283
So, how did y'all get into ghosts?
Did one of you see one?

1020
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:04,490
Yeah, I did.

1021
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:05,561
Really?

1022
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:09,850
When I was eight years old,
the mean old lady that lived next door died.

1023
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:14,401
And that night, I woke up

1024
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,482
and she was standing at the foot of my bed,

1025
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,762
just staring at me.

1026
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:26,571
She did that every night for almost a year.

1027
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:27,766
What?

1028
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:32,165
And I told my parents,
and they didn't believe me.

1029
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:34,081
Still don't believe me.

1030
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,803
I had to go to therapy for years,

1031
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,770
and the kids at school found out,

1032
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:42,730
and they would laugh at me
and make fun of me,

1033
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,290
call me "ghost girl."

1034
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,602
Abby was the only person who believed me.

1035
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,563
Kids is mean, man. But I believe you.

1036
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:54,166
Thanks.

1037
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:56,288
- I have some questions.
- Seriously?

1038
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,404
- Okay, ready?
- Oh, no.

1039
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,528
- I found this in a box when we were moving.
- Oh, no.

1040
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:05,681
Oh, no!

1041
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:06,887
Yes!

1042
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,207
I wish we still had this presentation.

1043
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,442
I mean, it was pretty great.

1044
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,409
I kinda wish I could've seen it, man.

1045
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:15,562
- You might just get your wish, Patty.
- No way.

1046
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:17,369
Wait, you have it?

1047
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,045
Damn, I wish I hadn't wished that.

1048
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:21,282
Ghosts, they're real!

1049
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:23,841
Lord, help us.

1050
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:29,730
- Para...
- ...normal...

1051
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:31,768
- ...is...
- ...normal.

1052
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:33,171
And a valid science.

1053
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:35,686
- Thank you for requesting this.
- I...

1054
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:38,600
Why don't I see ghosts
flying around everywhere?

1055
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,485
The barrier stops them.

1056
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:44,724
It's the last line of defense betwixt
the worlds of the living and the dead.

1057
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,322
Protect the barrier! Protect the barrier!
Protect the barrier!

1058
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:50,330
Or mankind will end.

1059
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:53,930
That was really good.

1060
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,002
- That was really good.
- We actually...

1061
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:58,128
- That was... I'm a little proud of us.
- Yes.

1062
00:51:58,760 --> 00:51:59,761
Rhythmic clapping.

1063
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:01,968
I'm so goddamn happy
you two are back together.

1064
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:07,883
Man, I'm gonna tell you right now, y'all,
I was hating it up until the finale,

1065
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:09,485
but the finale is what got me.

1066
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:11,130
- Guys, we're on TV.
- What?

1067
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:15,285
A local team of paranormal investigators
released a video of a proclaimed ghost.

1068
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:18,848
You can see clearly there's something
in the picture that isn't easily explained.

1069
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:22,129
Oh, my God! They're showing the video!
We famous! We famous.

1070
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:23,810
As a result, there are
a lot of questions being asked now

1071
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,689
about the people who shot the video.

1072
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:29,242
So, what do we think of these Ghostbusters?
Are they to be taken seriously? And...

1073
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:31,209
"Ghostbusters"? That is not our name.

1074
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,645
They can't just make up a name
and just call us...

1075
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:33,721
I spoke with Martin Heiss earlier.

1076
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,211
- He's with the Council for Logic and Data.
- Okay.

1077
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:36,566
- Martin Heiss. Okay, okay.
- Okay.

1078
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:39,371
He is a famed debunker of the paranormal.

1079
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,568
Dr. Heiss, you're a highly regarded
scientific authority.

1080
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:43,688
- Your credentials are impeccable.
- Thank you, Pat.

1081
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,843
If you see something
of true scientific interest in this video,

1082
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:50,811
that goes a long way to legitimize these
Ghostbusters and everything they stand for.

1083
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:52,724
A game changer, yes.

1084
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,725
So, tell me, Dr. Heiss, is this for real?

1085
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:58,205
Hell no.

1086
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:00,810
So, now we're the ghost girls.

1087
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:02,845
I feel your pain, Erin.

1088
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:05,730
No. You know what? Screw that.

1089
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:07,245
We are scientists.

1090
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:08,651
- Plus Patty.
- Thank you.

1091
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:11,371
Okay, we believe in provable,
physical results.

1092
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,044
- That's what we believe in.
- Yes, we do!

1093
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:14,281
- Preach.
- I will preach.

1094
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:15,566
You know what we're gonna do, ladies?

1095
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:17,847
We're gonna catch a ghost,
we're gonna bring...

1096
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:19,207
God.

1097
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:22,011
We're gonna catch a ghost,
bring it back to the lab...

1098
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:23,320
- Kevin?
- Yes, boss?

1099
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:24,845
Can you answer the phone
that's ringing, please?

1100
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:26,649
- Buddy.
- Yes, I can, boss.

1101
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,001
Ghostbusters.

1102
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:30,684
- "Conductors of the Metaphysical..."
- Okay.

1103
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:31,921
Cool. See ya.

1104
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,685
Hey, guys, which one of these
makes me look more like a doctor?

1105
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,490
Me playing saxophone
or me listening to saxophone?

1106
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,444
Who was on the phone?

1107
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:42,363
The Stonebrook Theatre.

1108
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:43,851
There's a goat on the loose.

1109
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:46,565
I'm gonna load up the car.

1110
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:48,766
Okay, okay, okay!

1111
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:50,285
Yo, yo, I got something for us, too!

1112
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,568
Hey, hey, hey, you guys,
I got these from work.

1113
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:55,846
I'm making it official, man.

1114
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:57,769
You put one of these on,
you won't get slimed again.

1115
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:59,730
- That's great.
- Yeah, we'll put them on in the car.

1116
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:01,888
- Okay.
- Erin!

1117
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:06,161
One second.

1118
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:07,881
Who's that?

1119
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:08,961
Erin!

1120
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:12,281
Hello, Phil.

1121
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:15,682
How do you just completely ignore
my calls and messages for a week?

1122
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:17,762
- Me? Ignore you?
- Yeah.

1123
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:21,526
You just stood there during the most
humiliating moment of my life.

1124
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:22,840
Is that her boyfriend?

1125
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:24,567
- No.
- Sexy.

1126
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:27,246
Who are you? Who are these people?

1127
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:29,926
You didn't tell me about
a book that you wrote,

1128
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,685
and now everyone's saying
you're some sort of crazy ghost hunter.

1129
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:36,128
Okay, well, first of all, that's wrong.
We don't hunt ghosts.

1130
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:39,488
We stalk them.
And we are very close to trapping one soon.

1131
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,930
And then we will study it
and do reports on it.

1132
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,970
Yeah, he probably dances real sexy.

1133
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:48,088
You know what I'm saying,
like, just a wind...

1134
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:50,966
I don't think his hips move at all.

1135
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:53,327
I think he's mechanical
from, like, the rib cage down.

1136
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,528
- No!
- I know how that guy dances.

1137
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:56,601
- How's he dance?
- Like...

1138
00:54:57,960 --> 00:54:59,041
No!

1139
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:01,441
I'm telling you, he...
Look, I bet you he get loose and...

1140
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:03,488
I bet you he pop locks. I bet you...

1141
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:05,369
He does... No!

1142
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:07,926
None of that. None of that's happening.

1143
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,641
- It's rigid. It's got a lot of teeth.
- Girl. Please.

1144
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:13,890
And he thinks he's doing you a favor.

1145
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:15,803
- Man, he rip that...
- And you're like, "Get it off me."

1146
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:18,042
He rip that V-neck off
and he gets it busy, man.

1147
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:21,761
And he's got... He rips that V-neck off,
he's got another V-neck underneath it.

1148
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:25,004
And you know what?
I don't care that people think I'm crazy.

1149
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:26,320
I don't care what you think, or anyone.

1150
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,607
Because what we're doing here
is groundbreaking.

1151
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:31,087
It's serious. We're doing important work.

1152
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,004
Hey!

1153
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,411
Look at this beauty!

1154
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:41,286
Wait a minute.
What did you do to my uncle's hearse?

1155
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:42,401
I fixed it.

1156
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:47,366
He works at a funeral home!
I can't take this back with a ghost on it!

1157
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:49,010
It's our science mobile, I'll have you know.

1158
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:53,244
And I'm about to go with my science friends,
and we are about to do real work.

1159
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:55,891
So, good day to you, sir.

1160
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:58,602
- Erin.
- We gotta go!

1161
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:00,364
We are late. Get in here.

1162
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,522
- Not you, Phil.
- Erin!

1163
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:04,728
- Funny.
- Erin, we have to... This is not funny.

1164
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:05,841
Just get in the...

1165
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,444
- Erin, please get in.
- Holtzmann, this is not the time.

1166
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,921
You are killing me. Erin.

1167
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:14,320
We have fun.

1168
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:51,521
- Let's go.
- Let's go...

1169
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:52,726
- Did you want to...
- I'm sorry.

1170
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,211
- I'll let you. I'll let you.
- Next time.

1171
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,728
Are you the Ghostbusters?

1172
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,404
Actually, we're
the Conductors of the Metaphysical...

1173
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:13,482
We're... Yes. We're the Ghostbusters.

1174
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:23,564
"There's a chicken frying itself
in the library."

1175
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:25,768
- That is strange.
- That is not what he said.

1176
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:27,604
Please, follow me.

1177
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:30,683
Right away. Please, all of you.

1178
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:34,725
Fernando was down here when
something crawled out of a wall vent, and...

1179
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:37,081
I heard him screaming, so I went to check,

1180
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:41,529
and that's when the "thing" was
tossing Fernando all around the room.

1181
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:44,650
I thought it was gonna kill him.
I shrieked when I saw it. I...

1182
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:48,527
I guess I scared it, because I'm told
that I have a very disturbing scream.

1183
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:49,921
I could see that.

1184
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,765
Anyway, if you could just mosey around,
you'll probably bump into it.

1185
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:53,921
'Kay, girls?

1186
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,609
All right. Well, we know
it's down here somewhere.

1187
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:59,570
Let's split up, and if you see anything,
get on the walkie.

1188
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:01,961
Roger.

1189
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:21,642
Holtzmann! This is serious!

1190
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:24,166
And I agree. We all agree.

1191
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:25,765
Except for Kathy. She doesn't get it.

1192
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:27,171
All right, come on.

1193
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:49,686
Guys, I think I got
another one of those devices.

1194
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:51,683
I just thought this was gonna be
like a book club.

1195
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:53,842
Play some Stevie Nicks albums, you know?

1196
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:57,164
'Cause I'm telling you right now,
if I see two twins from The Shining,

1197
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:58,241
I'm gonna pass out.

1198
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:02,640
Okay, yep.

1199
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:05,328
Room full of nightmares. Not going in there.

1200
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:07,880
I don't understand
how I get wrapped up in this stuff.

1201
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,123
I had a good job at the MTA.

1202
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:14,484
Was it perfect?
No, of course it wasn't perfect.

1203
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:17,484
But I tell you what, everybody was alive.

1204
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:21,965
Was that there before?

1205
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:24,209
Please do not answer.

1206
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:26,645
I said, don't answer!

1207
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:31,887
Okay...

1208
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:38,881
Hi.

1209
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:42,010
It's a full paranormal transferal embodiment.

1210
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:45,243
Erin, all of our theories
on spectral possession are true.

1211
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:48,087
There's a ghost in that thing, and I want it.

1212
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:49,207
Let's light 'em up!

1213
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:01,450
Run! We're gonna lose it! Come on!

1214
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:03,045
- I love your fire!
- Man.

1215
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:14,925
Upstairs! Go, go, go! Come on!

1216
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:18,570
Why fear what's around you?

1217
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:21,129
It could be everything you dreamed
And it's about to be true

1218
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:23,680
Yeah

1219
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:27,089
Come with the one who wants to
drag you away from the shore

1220
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:28,241
'Cause you're looking for more

1221
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:30,810
You want some more

1222
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:33,289
That's not mine!

1223
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:38,522
I think those machines
are making them stronger!

1224
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:40,011
That thing is super ionized!

1225
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:41,570
And super not-benign!

1226
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:44,211
This music is so terrible,
it's making him more angry.

1227
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:45,691
Play something gentle!

1228
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:48,886
Behold the power of the undead!

1229
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:52,527
We have summoned Satan himself!

1230
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,968
For we are the kings of all...

1231
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:04,803
- Let's do this!
- Go, go.

1232
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:21,120
This auditorium is Art Deco, you idiots!

1233
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:22,925
Aim for the ghost!

1234
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:28,211
Hey, Patty, you take that aisle.
I'll take the far one.

1235
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:31,329
Okay, I need y'all to get out the way!
We need to get up those aisles!

1236
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:34,011
All right, move, people!
I need to get down that aisle!

1237
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:36,686
If you're not gonna move,
you're gonna become part of this operation!

1238
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:38,529
All right, heads up!

1239
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:40,601
Come on! Move me left!

1240
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:43,329
Watch the rings. Watch the rings.

1241
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:44,925
Okay, you sweaty freaks.

1242
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,048
I'm 'bout to save you from this ghost!

1243
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:56,691
Okay, so I don't know if it was a race thing
or a lady thing, but I'm mad as hell.

1244
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:58,444
- Pick me up!
- All right, put me down!

1245
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:01,000
Put me down! Down, down, thank you.

1246
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:04,451
Okay, Patty, stay still!

1247
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:06,727
- You have sort of a...
- Okay, I just...

1248
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:08,450
I don't need you to tell me
anything right now.

1249
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:10,807
- No, no, no... You got a...
- Nope.

1250
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:13,611
I really need you not to tell me
anything right now.

1251
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:15,842
- But, Patty, there...
- Hey. I'm tired.

1252
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:16,961
- No, no, no...
- Listen...

1253
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:18,451
I'm just gonna go ahead and take off,
how about that?

1254
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:20,648
No, no, no,
I don't really think that's a good idea.

1255
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:22,961
- Going to take off...
- Come on, Patty. Patty!

1256
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:27,090
And I don't want to piss off the ghost.

1257
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:31,411
Moving, going back to my booth at the MTA,

1258
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:33,687
so let me know if you
need some MetroCards.

1259
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:35,410
- Do it, do it, do it.
- 'Cause I am...

1260
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:38,126
- Really?
- All right, ladies, light 'em up!

1261
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:40,089
Patty, stay still.

1262
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:41,810
Just don't hit Patty anywhere important.

1263
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:43,166
- What?
- Nothing!

1264
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:48,566
You gonna get it now!

1265
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:54,921
Erin, I forgot to tell you, don't let
your beam get entangled with my beam.

1266
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:57,281
- What? Why?
- It's too much power.

1267
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:58,646
It would cause a counter reaction.

1268
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:02,281
The beam would shoot back into your body,
and each atom will implode.

1269
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:04,567
- What!
- Holtz, open that trap!

1270
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:05,801
Okay.

1271
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:08,281
And I'm gonna open it on three.

1272
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:09,805
- Holtzmann!
- Ready?

1273
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:11,645
- Sweetie!
- Two...

1274
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:13,848
- Open the box!
- And one. Okay!

1275
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:19,888
Erin, doing great. Abby, doing great.

1276
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:21,803
Patty, try a little harder, okay?

1277
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:23,530
Get in the box, you hellion!

1278
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:27,250
Come on, we got you!

1279
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:28,401
Come on.

1280
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:39,251
Excuse me, gotta get...
Excuse me, excuse me.

1281
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:40,446
I got a ghost to get. Thank you.

1282
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:49,086
Did we just catch a ghost?

1283
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:50,207
Yeah, yeah.

1284
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:52,044
We put a ghost in a box!

1285
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:57,207
You want some more, you want some more?

1286
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:58,521
Yes!

1287
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:00,648
What you're looking for
You want some more...

1288
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:01,721
Right in there!

1289
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:04,087
We are the Beasts of Mayhem!

1290
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:12,968
Sorry, can't buy you another one.

1291
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:14,121
Yeah!

1292
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:21,041
Wankers! Black Sabbath did that shit in '74.

1293
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:23,722
Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters!

1294
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:25,245
- My gosh.
- Thanks so much.

1295
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:26,970
Why are there ghosts in New York?

1296
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:29,611
We made magic today,
and that's all I got to say. I'm Holtzmann.

1297
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:31,409
Where are these ghosts coming from?

1298
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:34,570
Are there any more ghosts
inside the theater?

1299
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:36,170
I think we took it out.

1300
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:37,241
Listen, we're scientists.

1301
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:40,847
We're here for the unanswerable questions
and, really, to pursue truth.

1302
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:42,160
We're the Ghostbusters!

1303
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:43,685
Yeah!

1304
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:48,161
Nope. I had him yesterday.

1305
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:49,447
So?

1306
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:50,681
So, it's your turn.

1307
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:52,840
Weirdo city.

1308
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:54,925
Charge the lines.

1309
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,364
Create the vortex.

1310
01:04:57,880 --> 01:04:59,530
Break the barrier.

1311
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:03,001
Enjoy your fun, Ghostbusters.

1312
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:06,729
For soon, you shall bow down before me.

1313
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:22,601
There he is.

1314
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:24,603
Come on, Kevin. Let's go.

1315
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:25,727
Kev.

1316
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:26,881
Go, Kev.

1317
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:29,089
Go, Kev. Go, Kev.

1318
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:30,161
Go, Kev.

1319
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:31,801
Stop, Kev.

1320
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:33,405
- Watch it!
- Stop, Kev.

1321
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:35,364
- Watch it.
- Stop it, Kevin.

1322
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:42,926
Please.

1323
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:47,245
Get it. Get it.

1324
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:49,485
This is so good. We have to celebrate.

1325
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:51,483
- Come on! This is what...
- You're right, you're right.

1326
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:53,085
- Yep.
- ...legit feels like.

1327
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:54,161
- Right here. This.
- Yep.

1328
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:55,446
Oh, my God.

1329
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:58,083
You have to stop kissing this.

1330
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:01,209
That... It just makes me feel
so warm and tingly inside.

1331
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:03,044
That's probably the radiation.

1332
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:07,281
Hey, guys, I got some pretty cool stuff
cooking up over here,

1333
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:09,368
if you want to just turn your head.

1334
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:13,525
I got some newly printed circuit boards,
and I rebuilt the superconducting magnets.

1335
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:14,840
I improved beam accuracy

1336
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:17,161
by adding a plasma shield
to the RF discharge chamber.

1337
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:19,408
I have cryocooler to reduce helium boil-off,

1338
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:23,166
and to top it all off,
we got a freakin' Faraday cage

1339
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:25,368
to attenuate RF noise and avoid quenching.

1340
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:28,521
- Nice!
- All right!

1341
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:30,568
There's a Smartin Christ here to see you.

1342
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:33,651
Smartin Christ?

1343
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:36,001
Wait, are you saying "Martin Heiss"?

1344
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:37,570
- Doctor...
- No. No.

1345
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:39,808
Dr. Martin Heiss, the famed scientist
and paranormal debunker?

1346
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:41,848
- He's in this building right now?
- Yeah, that guy.

1347
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:44,964
Okay, you tell him that we're not here.

1348
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:47,042
- Wait, what? What?
- I don't want to talk to him.

1349
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:48,121
They're not here.

1350
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:53,402
Dr. Heiss, hello. Welcome. Dr. Erin Gilbert.

1351
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:57,724
Is this a good time, Doctor,
or is this dinner rush?

1352
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:00,324
Why don't you call
and make an appointment?

1353
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:01,606
It's actually a perfect time.

1354
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:05,890
We were just
doing some experiments over here.

1355
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:09,569
Yes, please, have a seat.

1356
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:11,005
Let's start light and easy.

1357
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:17,087
Why are you pretending to catch ghosts?

1358
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:21,803
You know, it's really easy
to just sit there and be the naysayer,

1359
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:23,689
when you don't actually do anything.

1360
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:27,651
You know that we only comprehend
about 4% of the universe.

1361
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:29,006
4%!

1362
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:31,686
- Across the board! It's four!
- Abby, Abby...

1363
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:35,525
We all believe in the scientific method.

1364
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:37,329
I've dedicated my life to it.

1365
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:41,931
And we have actually done it.

1366
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:44,807
Today, at 4:32 p.m.,

1367
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:49,249
we successfully trapped a Class 3 vapor.

1368
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:50,481
You're telling me

1369
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:52,691
there is a ghost

1370
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:55,489
inside that thermos?

1371
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:57,608
- In that can?
- Don't touch it. Don't touch it.

1372
01:07:57,680 --> 01:07:59,330
Booyah. Emphasis on the "boo."

1373
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:01,602
Well, I would love to see that.
I really would.

1374
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:04,929
Shoot. You know what?
You're not gonna get that treat today.

1375
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:08,641
We're still assessing what type
of containment method we're gonna use.

1376
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:11,690
We're testing the lab... In the...

1377
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:16,330
So, till we figure out
how to best keep the entity,

1378
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:18,800
that's not gonna happen.

1379
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:20,325
How's that for my timing?

1380
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:21,925
I come.

1381
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,321
You've caught a ghost. I can't see it.

1382
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:27,006
Look, I know it probably
sounds like we're making this up.

1383
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:29,168
- Yeah.
- It sounds crazy,

1384
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:33,131
and we probably don't really look like
legitimate scientists.

1385
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:35,646
No, you only lack the proper equipment,

1386
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:38,883
like a garbage truck
to hang on to the back of.

1387
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,607
Said the guy with
the walking stick and the floppy hat.

1388
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:44,886
It was my mother's.

1389
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:46,726
Yeah, that is an awesome hat.

1390
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:49,246
All right, man. Thanks for stopping by.

1391
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,241
Well, I guess the graciousness has run out.

1392
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:54,807
You want to see it?

1393
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:57,884
I would love to see it.

1394
01:08:57,960 --> 01:08:59,086
Well, he can't see it.

1395
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:01,527
I'm going to show it to you, then.
How about that?

1396
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:03,523
- Gear up, you guys.
- No, you're not. Don't.

1397
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:07,285
Excuse me. Why are you doing this?

1398
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:08,850
Because he doesn't believe us.

1399
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:11,686
Erin. Come on, we have finally succeeded

1400
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:14,240
at doing the thing that we have talked about
since we were little kids.

1401
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:16,921
And you want to risk it all, what, for him?

1402
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,764
Who cares if you impress him?

1403
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:21,451
Golly, you two are something.

1404
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:23,361
You're right. I'm sorry.

1405
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:24,965
- I don't...
- Okay.

1406
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:26,360
- I don't know what I was thinking.
- All right.

1407
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:27,601
It's okay.

1408
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:31,247
Attagirl!

1409
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:32,367
Sorry. I did it. I'm sorry.

1410
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:33,527
- My God!
- I know!

1411
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:34,442
Casper?

1412
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:40,601
Man!

1413
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:42,923
Hey, that man went out the wrong door.

1414
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:46,931
Oh, my God.

1415
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:52,762
He wasn't really Ghostbusters material.

1416
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:54,530
Who threw him out the window?

1417
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:56,682
A ghost threw him out the window.

1418
01:09:56,920 --> 01:09:58,081
You mean like Patrick Swayze?

1419
01:09:58,160 --> 01:09:59,969
Like, he's sitting behind you,
making some pottery?

1420
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:01,804
Yeah. Like Patrick Swayze.

1421
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:05,202
That's it. Then we were all dancing
at a summer camp in the Catskills.

1422
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:07,282
And then we sat down,
and he was behind me,

1423
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:08,407
and we made a vase.

1424
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:09,606
You're combining the two...

1425
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:11,364
- I combined a couple of Swayze movies.
- Yeah.

1426
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:12,726
You know what was a good one? Road House.

1427
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,040
I loved Road House.

1428
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:15,201
- Point Break.
- He was a...

1429
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:16,361
Point Break.

1430
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:17,845
Come on. At the end with the big wave?

1431
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:19,046
He was a ghost in that, too!

1432
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:20,281
Well, you don't know if he dies at the end.

1433
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:22,801
He doesn't die.
He doesn't die. They don't say he dies.

1434
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:24,086
Well, now what?

1435
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:27,566
- Who are you guys?
- Official business.

1436
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:29,051
We'll take it from here. Thank you.

1437
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:30,366
- What?
- You need to come with us.

1438
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:31,407
- What?
- Why?

1439
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:32,811
The mayor needs a word, ladies.

1440
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:43,846
So it's tandem parachuting.
So you'd be with an instructor.

1441
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:45,401
The little spoon.

1442
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:48,131
- And who is on top?
- The instructor.

1443
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:53,571
Mayor.

1444
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:55,881
Hey! There you are.

1445
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:58,770
Welcome. Sorry for the mess
and for the drama.

1446
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:00,683
Please, come sit down. Take that one.

1447
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:02,808
Good. That's right.
And, you, that's a good one for you.

1448
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:05,326
And take the end seat. Good.

1449
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:07,801
That's not so good.

1450
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:09,609
No feet on the table, please.

1451
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:11,170
Sir, we don't have a lot of time.

1452
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:12,446
- And we're not frauds.
- No.

1453
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:13,885
- We are legitimate scientists.
- Let me interrupt you.

1454
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:15,405
We know you're not frauds,

1455
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:18,006
because we have been monitoring
this situation quite closely.

1456
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:21,243
Agents Hawkins and Rorke
are with Homeland Security.

1457
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:25,405
So we've been investigating
this extremely quietly.

1458
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:28,041
- Okay.
- So, what do you know?

1459
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:31,371
We believe that someone is creating a device

1460
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:33,761
that attracts and amplifies
paranormal activity.

1461
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:35,968
And that activity can be escalating now

1462
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:38,520
and giving us an even larger scale event.

1463
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:40,568
"Larger scale." Well, that sounds terrible.

1464
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:43,482
Okay, well,
you've been doing great work. Well done.

1465
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:45,881
We really appreciate it,
but it's time to knock it off.

1466
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:48,324
- What?
- Knock it off.

1467
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:51,324
No, I heard you and I see the hand gesture.
What does...

1468
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:53,641
These gentlemen are on it.
Let the government do their work.

1469
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:58,282
We're just worried that you all
are drawing a lot of attention...

1470
01:11:58,360 --> 01:11:59,885
- Exactly.
- ...to yourselves.

1471
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,047
What?

1472
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:03,043
- Patty does wear big earrings.
- Patty.

1473
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:07,206
Well, if it's a crime to look good,
guilty as charged.

1474
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:10,523
Other than that, I feel like
we keep a very low profile.

1475
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:12,204
You drive a hearse with a ghost on it,

1476
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:14,760
and you use a distinctly
un-American-sounding siren.

1477
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:15,841
We do.

1478
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:17,570
Do you have any idea
how many federal regulations

1479
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:19,165
you're breaking on a daily basis?

1480
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:20,605
- One?
- No.

1481
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:22,684
- Two?
- No.

1482
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:23,761
Is it one?

1483
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:25,410
Just sit quietly.

1484
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:26,925
Here's the essence of the deal.

1485
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,924
We are gonna have to
make the public believe

1486
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,331
that you are frauds.

1487
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:33,364
- What? Wait. Why?
- What?

1488
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:35,886
The human brain, you know,
it can only handle so much.

1489
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:39,043
If everybody knew what was going on,
you know, there'd be a panic.

1490
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:43,762
So, we need to get the information out there
that the incident at the concert was a hoax.

1491
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:47,165
'Cause, otherwise, there'd be mass hysteria.

1492
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:50,485
We don't want mass hysteria either.

1493
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:53,370
Our main concern is that
we're allowed to continue our work.

1494
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:56,171
- Yes, that is very important.
- Very important.

1495
01:12:56,240 --> 01:13:03,089
But my concern is, I feel like the cat is sort of
already kind of out of the bag.

1496
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:06,562
I think what they're saying is
the cat is out of the bag.

1497
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:10,122
They want us to put the cat
back inside the bag.

1498
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:11,281
No, I know that's what they're saying.

1499
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:13,408
- But I'm saying the cat's already out.
- I know. I know it's out.

1500
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:15,244
- So it's hard to put the cat back in.
- It's not impossible.

1501
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:17,243
- But that's why they have that saying.
- It's a nonsense saying.

1502
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:18,970
If the cat is outta the bag,
you can't put it back in!

1503
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:20,081
I put a cat in a bag all the time.

1504
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:21,161
But once the cat is out of the bag,

1505
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:22,401
aren't you like, "The cat is out of the bag!"

1506
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:24,528
We just want to
shove that damn cat back in the bag.

1507
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:26,409
The cat has been out of the bag before,

1508
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:29,006
and yet, people lose interest
and put it back in.

1509
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:30,481
People always move on.

1510
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:33,723
Sheriff in New Mexico
reports a UFO encounter.

1511
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:37,088
The crew of the SS Ourang Medan
dies mysteriously.

1512
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:40,687
The entire town of Langville, Montana,
goes missing.

1513
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:42,206
It does?

1514
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:43,327
Okay, but he...

1515
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:45,324
We're talking about relocating.

1516
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:48,603
No one's being killed here, right?

1517
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,764
They were turned inside out.

1518
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:53,241
Their skin is on the inside of their body?

1519
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:57,530
Their skin is on the inside of their body
because their organs are on the outside.

1520
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,206
But they're okay, right?

1521
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:00,767
Sure.

1522
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:02,690
I think they're dead.

1523
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:06,204
On that horrifying note,
thank you all so much for coming.

1524
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:09,851
Call this number if you have any more info.

1525
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:12,764
When it comes to these ghosts,
we'll take it from here.

1526
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:16,121
The US government
doesn't need the help of hobbyists, okay?

1527
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:19,409
So go back upstairs to
your little dim sum tea party, okay?

1528
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:22,723
And leave it to us. We're the big dogs.

1529
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:30,406
- Hey, come on, man.
- I'm sorry. Sorry.

1530
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:33,401
Meatheads.

1531
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:37,566
- Unlock it. Unlock it.
- Okay, wait. Hold on.

1532
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:46,651
Roll your window up.

1533
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:48,241
I'm watching you.

1534
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:52,926
You think they got genitals in there?
Or is it more of a Ken doll situation?

1535
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:54,406
I'm watching you!

1536
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:57,241
I'm gonna go with Ken doll situation.

1537
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,001
It's smooth.

1538
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:01,528
We're watching you!

1539
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:05,846
Now, the mayor said we could
continue our work, and so we shall.

1540
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:06,967
We got to be prepared.

1541
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:09,930
That's why I've made a table of treats.

1542
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,729
Erin, you've had a hard day. Step right up.

1543
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:13,040
Pick a gun, any gun.

1544
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:15,161
No!

1545
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:16,850
I'm sorry, not that gun.

1546
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:18,888
That one's not ready. It's yours when it is.

1547
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:20,325
Here, in the meantime...

1548
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:22,281
This.

1549
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:24,645
What does it do?

1550
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:26,290
It's a Swiss Army knife.

1551
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:28,408
No woman should walk around unarmed.

1552
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:30,046
I know what it does.

1553
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:32,521
- Also, here, why don't you take this.
- Yeah?

1554
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:34,610
Give that a toss.

1555
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:36,648
That's gonna send up a little poof.

1556
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:38,728
It's only dangerous to ghosts.

1557
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:40,165
- All right.
- Okay.

1558
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:45,167
Nice!

1559
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:51,681
Yeah, my mistake. It was a medium poof.

1560
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:54,008
This puppy I like to call a Ghost Chipper.

1561
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:58,005
Hollow-laser technology,
sucks in the ghost and neutralizes it.

1562
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:01,084
Step up to bat and do what you're gonna do.

1563
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:04,006
You truly scare me.
I just want to let you know that.

1564
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:07,691
I'm gonna just...

1565
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:15,447
Come on!

1566
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:17,841
It's like Mardi Gras in there.

1567
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:19,490
It's a proton glove.

1568
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:22,769
It's gonna maximize flexibility
during hand-to-specter combat.

1569
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:24,922
Just give it a punch, it's motion-activated.

1570
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:37,610
Okay. That

1571
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:39,965
was awesome!

1572
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:46,683
- No, that is a deadly high five.
- No.

1573
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:48,125
- No.
- Hey, ladies,

1574
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:50,407
I'd call this a successful test.

1575
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:54,931
It's fraudulent and unsafe, frankly.

1576
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:59,085
You know, these Ghostbusters
are creating an unnecessary panic

1577
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:00,924
- in a sad grab for fame.
- It's fine.

1578
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,401
People can rest assured
that these women are fake.

1579
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:06,687
Damn.

1580
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:08,967
- My favorite acid.
- It's okay. I'll get it. I'll get it.

1581
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:10,041
Be careful.

1582
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:12,325
Hey, guys, I've been meaning to ask,

1583
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:14,801
what was that thing that threw that man
out the window the other day?

1584
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:16,689
Kevin, it was a ghost.

1585
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:19,366
- A ghost?
- Do you not know what goes on here, Kevin?

1586
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:20,601
Okay, I've got it.

1587
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:22,926
We sell the restaurant.

1588
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:24,684
Guys, we haven't had customers, anyway.

1589
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:27,650
It's time to face the facts,
the restaurant is not working.

1590
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:29,085
You're standing in the acid.

1591
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:31,208
- Not my slippers.
- It's hydrochloric acid.

1592
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:33,169
Get the baking soda. There you go.

1593
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:35,004
That's how you clean up hydrochloric.

1594
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:36,081
Good boy.

1595
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:39,528
- Oh, God, it stinks.
- Just a big, beautiful dummy.

1596
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:42,570
Well, it's official.
We're all ghost girls now.

1597
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:44,127
Can't see.

1598
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:46,646
- Well, that's the acid.
- Get back to the eyewash station.

1599
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:49,451
- Where is that?
- Back by the bathroom. Left.

1600
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:50,561
There you go.

1601
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:52,850
Stop when you hit something.

1602
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,206
- Okay.
- Jesus.

1603
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:56,281
Good job.

1604
01:17:56,680 --> 01:17:59,286
All right, I would like
to remind everybody here

1605
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:01,767
that in a very short amount of time,

1606
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:05,128
we have seen
multiple Class 4 malevolent apparitions.

1607
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:06,486
- Yeah.
- We did.

1608
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:08,449
Who cares what anybody else
is saying about us?

1609
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:09,646
We know what we're doing.

1610
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:13,281
I mean, all morning,
I've been reading about this stuff.

1611
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:14,691
There's sightings all over the city.

1612
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:17,604
"Wailing spirit sighted at 6th and 26th."

1613
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:21,127
Another one,
"Spectral polar bear on 63rd and 5th."

1614
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:24,443
Then there was that weeping wall
in the thrift store at Chelsea.

1615
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:29,651
- Wait. Did you say 6th and 26th?
- Yeah. "Wailing spirits, 6th and 26th."

1616
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:33,242
6th and 26th. 6th and 26th. Okay.

1617
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:34,526
6th and 26th.

1618
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:39,809
Aldridge Mansion. Upper West Side. Yes?
70... 72nd.

1619
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:41,211
Where did we find the first device?

1620
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:43,971
- At the subway, right here.
- Okay.

1621
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:45,565
Theater. Downtown. Downtown.

1622
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:47,324
- Downtown?
- Yes, yes. In here.

1623
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:48,811
Okay, what was the other address you said?

1624
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:51,326
Polar bear on 63rd and 5th Avenue.

1625
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:52,811
And the one in Chelsea?

1626
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:56,680
- Chelsea is at 10th Avenue and 18th.
- 18th. 10th and 18th.

1627
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:10,046
What do those look like to you?

1628
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:13,290
It's an "X." Touching other little "X's."

1629
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:14,771
- Ley lines.
- Ley lines.

1630
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:16,001
What's "ley lines"?

1631
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:19,801
It's a hidden network of energy lines
that run across the Earth.

1632
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:22,087
It's a current of supernatural energy.

1633
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:25,689
Supposedly, if you look at sacred sites
and weird events all over the world,

1634
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:28,001
and connect them with lines
where they intersect,

1635
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:30,651
it's an unusually powerful spot.

1636
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:31,881
Abby and I just dismissed this theory

1637
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:34,930
because it just seemed
too random to have any merit.

1638
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:36,644
Dismiss this.

1639
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:42,089
Okay. That looks like it's got some merit.

1640
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:46,241
He's using the devices
to charge the ley lines.

1641
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:50,161
- He's creating a vortex.
- A vortex.

1642
01:19:50,680 --> 01:19:51,841
Oh, boy.

1643
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:55,129
Okay, if he gets one of his machines in there
and it's big enough,

1644
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:58,002
he's gonna be able
to rip a hole right through that barrier.

1645
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:00,242
Letting whatever's on this plane

1646
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:03,722
come crashing down on this plane.

1647
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:05,370
Okay, I'm calling this in.

1648
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:12,328
Okay, that intersection right there
between 7th and 8th.

1649
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:14,482
What is there now?

1650
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:18,481
The Mercado.
Mercado. It's Spanish for "table."

1651
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:20,688
The Mercado? That actually makes sense.

1652
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:23,604
Okay, yes, I'm looking for
Agents Hawkins and Rorke.

1653
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:26,251
The Mercado has one of
the weirdest histories

1654
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:27,526
of the buildings in New York.

1655
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:30,001
Okay, so it's your standard-issue
haunted building.

1656
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:32,321
No. This is even before it was a building.

1657
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:34,926
All sorts of massacres happened at that spot.

1658
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:38,721
Like the peaceful trade between
the Lenape Indians and Captain Warren.

1659
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:40,723
Then, all of a sudden, everybody dies.

1660
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:43,804
Oh, my God, you guys.
This is the dude that was at the subway

1661
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:46,008
that was talking about the cataclysms!
This is him!

1662
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:49,604
It's always the sad, pale ones.

1663
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:52,286
Okay, ladies, let's gear up
and hit that Mercado.

1664
01:20:57,520 --> 01:21:00,171
Who's in the mood to save New York City?

1665
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:28,882
And did you try adjusting the thermostat
before placing this call?

1666
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:32,009
Well, I'm terribly sorry
that you have a draft in your room.

1667
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:35,527
Why don't you hold while I connect you
to someone who might care.

1668
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:38,206
- Hi. Excuse me.
- Hold on.

1669
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:40,362
- What do you want?
- Where's your janitor?

1670
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:42,886
That nut-job! What has he done...

1671
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,570
I don't want to know.

1672
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:47,928
Just take the stairs down and get him out.

1673
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:20,328
Hey, stop right there!

1674
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:21,890
Shut it down!

1675
01:22:24,280 --> 01:22:25,691
The Ghostbusters.

1676
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:28,525
Look, I think it's great
you found yourself a little hobby,

1677
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:31,410
and I'm sure, on paper,
flooding New York City with ghosts

1678
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:32,811
seemed like a great idea,

1679
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:35,326
but we happen to like
the world the way it is.

1680
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:39,166
Then you must've been afforded the basic
dignity and respect of a human being,

1681
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:40,366
which I have been denied.

1682
01:22:40,440 --> 01:22:41,771
Not really.

1683
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:43,808
People dump on us pretty much all the time.

1684
01:22:44,440 --> 01:22:48,570
I am a genius.
I see things that no one else does.

1685
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:52,884
And for it, I am rewarded
with nothing but scorn and mockery.

1686
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:56,248
Luckily, I am not
the only one seeking revenge.

1687
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:58,209
Behind these are millions of souls,

1688
01:22:58,280 --> 01:22:59,805
souls which have been cast aside.

1689
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:04,568
Souls who see the world
as it truly is, as garbage.

1690
01:23:04,640 --> 01:23:06,722
Garbage that needs to be cleaned up.

1691
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:08,690
They're mostly dudes.

1692
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:10,928
When these barriers are destroyed,

1693
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:15,085
an army of the undead
will return to pester the living.

1694
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:18,209
Pester the living doesn't sound so bad.

1695
01:23:18,720 --> 01:23:24,090
They will return to pester the living
with unspeakable pain and torment.

1696
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:28,006
Children will be pestered limb from limb
in front of their own parents.

1697
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:31,721
The parents will be pestered in half
and pestered in half again.

1698
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:36,089
And pestered into the ground until their
bloody, pulpy bodies are nothing but meat.

1699
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:39,847
That's a different definition of "pester"
than what I was thinking.

1700
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:43,208
I think the word we're looking for
is apocalypse. Apocalypse.

1701
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:47,046
Well, let's get these barriers destroyed,
shall we?

1702
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:50,167
Wait, wait, wait! Rowan.

1703
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:54,524
I get it. You don't like people.
People can be terrible.

1704
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:58,241
The thing is, though,
there's so many terrific things out there.

1705
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:02,245
I mean, wonderful things
that are worth living for.

1706
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:05,324
I mean, you got soup,

1707
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:10,247
and, you know, that first... You know when...

1708
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:13,449
God. I can only think of soup.
Anybody? Somebody? Patty?

1709
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:14,681
- Salad.
- Salad.

1710
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:16,444
No, no, no! Wait, wait, wait!

1711
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:18,010
Okay, stop what you're doing.

1712
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:19,605
The police are already on their way.

1713
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:22,411
It's over. You're going to jail, Rowan.

1714
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:24,801
Well, in that case,

1715
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,047
bye.

1716
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:38,441
That's a weird move.

1717
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:39,806
He dead. That's a dead man.

1718
01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:41,928
See if you can shut that thing down.

1719
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:47,644
- Come on!
- Holtz?

1720
01:24:49,640 --> 01:24:50,846
Holtz, are we good?

1721
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:54,610
Well, he's not, but, yeah, we're okay.

1722
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:56,762
Okay. Well, that's over.

1723
01:24:56,840 --> 01:24:59,320
Okay, we're down here! Down here!

1724
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:01,084
You hate to see the smart ones go bad.

1725
01:25:02,040 --> 01:25:05,123
Man, it smells like burned bologna
and regrets down here.

1726
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:07,646
Like, the dude that worked here,

1727
01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:10,610
he, like, dressed, like,
in a Captain Kirk-type outfit.

1728
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:12,205
- What's up?
- He was, like, standing over here...

1729
01:25:12,280 --> 01:25:13,406
I don't know. It's strange.

1730
01:25:13,480 --> 01:25:16,290
You know, his technology's
not that different from ours.

1731
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:19,489
It's basically, like, we're
both using the same science.

1732
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:21,642
- That is strange.
- I think I know why.

1733
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:25,685
Look what Mr. Cuckoo Pants
has been reading at the beach. No.

1734
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:26,841
Oh, my God.

1735
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:29,844
I told you that there would be
people out there that loved our work.

1736
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:32,651
Why am I so flattered that
that weird little sociopath bought our book?

1737
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:37,009
Thank you for everything you did.
You saved us all.

1738
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:38,605
The mayor thanks you, of course.

1739
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:41,001
Privately, so don't tell anyone.

1740
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:42,047
Can I walk you out?

1741
01:25:42,120 --> 01:25:44,282
Well, why don't you all go get some rest?

1742
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:47,011
These gentlemen here
will get you out of here. Okay?

1743
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:48,246
- Thank you. That's very nice.
- All right.

1744
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:51,051
- Thanks for all you've done, ladies.
- Thank you very much.

1745
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:54,522
I just have to say a couple things
to the press. You know how that goes.

1746
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:56,728
So we just are gonna fake-arrest you now.

1747
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:59,565
And we towed your car.
Real-tow, not fake-tow.

1748
01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:00,687
- Ms. Lynch!
- What's that?

1749
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:02,609
- Ms. Lynch!
- What? Wait, why?

1750
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:04,647
- Excuse me!
- Stop resisting.

1751
01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:06,888
I'm not. I'm walking with you.

1752
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:09,327
- Is New York in trouble?
- Everything is fine.

1753
01:26:09,400 --> 01:26:15,851
It was just another publicity stunt
by these incredibly sad and lonely women.

1754
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:18,571
It's like they read Eat, Pray, Love
and just ran with it.

1755
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:38,922
Well, mission accomplished, ladies.

1756
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,571
I say we get some drinks and celebrate.

1757
01:26:41,640 --> 01:26:43,563
How about it, Erin? It's my treat.

1758
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:45,369
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1759
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:47,044
A couple quick questions for my blog.

1760
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:51,409
First, how does it feel wasting
tax payer money and government resources

1761
01:26:51,480 --> 01:26:52,891
with your pranks?

1762
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:55,964
Why don't you go back to
your mother's basement where you live?

1763
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:58,848
Yeah, I plan to, after this.

1764
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:01,048
Ms. Gilbert, I asked around your hometown.

1765
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:02,804
I talked to somebody
you went to school with.

1766
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:05,121
They said when you were a kid,
you made up a ghost.

1767
01:27:05,240 --> 01:27:08,847
So, tell me,
were you born a fraud, ghost girl?

1768
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:10,607
Don't call me that!

1769
01:27:10,680 --> 01:27:12,205
Erin! Oh, my God!

1770
01:27:12,280 --> 01:27:13,884
Erin, he's too pasty to fight.

1771
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:15,724
Erin, you're making us look bad right now.

1772
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:17,802
Erin, come on, let it go.

1773
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:20,008
They should put you back in therapy,
you freak.

1774
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:24,121
Damn!

1775
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,001
Hey.

1776
01:27:29,680 --> 01:27:31,728
Guess whose desk I just set on fire.

1777
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:33,211
You'll never guess.

1778
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:37,171
You may guess when you see
your desk later. Okay.

1779
01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:38,321
All right. Just read it. Just read it.

1780
01:27:38,440 --> 01:27:40,124
"Midtown movie theater owner claims

1781
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:44,444
"Basset Hound
regularly attends matinees by himself."

1782
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:46,204
- Look at his ears.
- Yes, I see.

1783
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:47,321
I meant the one about me.

1784
01:27:48,240 --> 01:27:49,241
Yes.

1785
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:54,087
It's devastating.

1786
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:56,121
Look, you're on TV.

1787
01:27:56,200 --> 01:27:57,565
We spoke to Dr. Harold Filmore,

1788
01:27:57,640 --> 01:27:59,961
Physics Department Chair
at Columbia University,

1789
01:28:00,040 --> 01:28:01,451
where Ms. Gilbert used to teach.

1790
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:02,487
No, no.

1791
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:06,167
It's unfortunate that we have
these former ties with Ms. Gilbert.

1792
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:11,007
Here at Columbia University,
we're about real science, discovering truth,

1793
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:13,961
not lying for a sad moment of fame.

1794
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:16,805
You know what?
They don't know what they're talking about.

1795
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:20,089
We also spoke with the Dean
of the Kenneth P. Higgins Institute.

1796
01:28:20,160 --> 01:28:21,127
Oh, God.

1797
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:25,205
Ms. Gilbert's association with the
Kenneth P. Higgins Institute, albeit distant,

1798
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:27,129
is a blight on this university.

1799
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:31,330
But, good news,
I have an album dropping in two weeks.

1800
01:28:31,400 --> 01:28:34,290
It's called I'mma Be Me, and I wouldn't mind
playing you the title track.

1801
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:37,801
God.

1802
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:39,325
Yo, Erin, shake that off.

1803
01:28:39,400 --> 01:28:40,640
You know how many lives you saved?

1804
01:28:40,720 --> 01:28:42,643
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we gotta get out there.

1805
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:45,326
We gotta get something to eat.
We gotta find that Basset Hound.

1806
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:46,845
I'll just see you guys tomorrow.

1807
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:48,684
I gotta go. I'm sorry.

1808
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:50,404
- Erin...
- I'm sorry!

1809
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:52,562
So, Abby, I've been doing a lot of thinking,

1810
01:28:52,680 --> 01:28:56,127
and congratulations,
I've decided to become a Ghostbuster.

1811
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:59,841
Oh, God. I don't have time to try to explain
why that's not going to happen.

1812
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:05,522
I thought they would've
been happy about that.

1813
01:29:51,160 --> 01:29:52,764
Did you guys lose your keys?

1814
01:29:52,840 --> 01:29:56,686
What did I tell you? Pin it to your bra strap.
That's where mine is, and it...

1815
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:21,451
Who's out there?
Holtzmann, I swear to God, I...

1816
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:46,090
Don't look so surprised.

1817
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:50,283
You didn't think I was gone when
there's so much left to do, did you, Abby?

1818
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:53,009
It's brilliant, really.

1819
01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:58,291
My devices energized spectral entities
on a nuclear, paramolecular level.

1820
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:00,440
Sound familiar?

1821
01:31:01,160 --> 01:31:03,003
It's the reverse of your research.

1822
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:06,609
Do it in the right place, with enough power,
and there goes the barrier.

1823
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:10,242
And then the world shall bend to...

1824
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:14,805
Okay. I apologize.
That looks nastier than I intended.

1825
01:31:17,560 --> 01:31:18,561
Enjoy, Abby!

1826
01:31:34,440 --> 01:31:35,646
Ghostbusters. What do you want?

1827
01:31:36,240 --> 01:31:39,528
Hello? Guys, it's me. Are you there?
Please pick up if you're there.

1828
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:40,847
Call me as soon as you get this.

1829
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:44,402
I think when Rowan killed himself,
it was just the next step in his plan.

1830
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:46,847
The mayor's itinerary has been set.

1831
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:51,084
Mayor Bradley is meeting with the diplomats
at Lotus Leaf this very moment.

1832
01:31:52,120 --> 01:31:53,485
Lotus Leaf.

1833
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:59,369
Abby! We got you a sandwich
so you don't be picking off of ours, man.

1834
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:02,330
You need some food.
Your moods have been real bad, yo.

1835
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:03,606
Come on now.

1836
01:32:03,680 --> 01:32:06,081
Abby? You in there?

1837
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:10,291
Everything okay?

1838
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,367
Abby, come and get your sandwich

1839
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:15,329
Come and get your sandwich, please

1840
01:32:15,960 --> 01:32:17,644
You want your little sandwich?

1841
01:32:18,720 --> 01:32:20,210
Abby...

1842
01:32:20,280 --> 01:32:21,611
Hello, Jillian.

1843
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:23,201
Hello, Abby.

1844
01:32:24,200 --> 01:32:25,565
Are you okay?

1845
01:32:25,640 --> 01:32:27,005
I'm quite well.

1846
01:32:27,560 --> 01:32:28,891
That's good.

1847
01:32:39,640 --> 01:32:40,971
You found my pipe.

1848
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:42,485
I got it at the dumpster yesterday.

1849
01:32:43,080 --> 01:32:45,560
I'm gonna use it to make a proton shotgun.

1850
01:32:45,640 --> 01:32:46,971
Pretty cool, right?

1851
01:32:47,080 --> 01:32:49,845
If it doesn't work,
we can just swing it around and break stuff,

1852
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:51,524
so it's kind of a win-win.

1853
01:32:52,920 --> 01:32:54,206
- What?
- What are you doing?

1854
01:32:55,080 --> 01:32:56,161
Not my babies!

1855
01:32:57,200 --> 01:32:58,326
Hey!

1856
01:32:58,640 --> 01:33:00,005
- Wait a minute!
- No!

1857
01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:01,411
Man, are y'all playing?

1858
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:04,205
'Cause this ain't funny, man. Yo! For real!

1859
01:33:04,280 --> 01:33:06,601
See, Abby, I told you
to have that sandwich, man.

1860
01:33:06,680 --> 01:33:08,125
Low blood sugar is serious!

1861
01:33:08,200 --> 01:33:09,725
- Hello, Patricia.
- What?

1862
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:16,486
Abby!

1863
01:33:16,760 --> 01:33:17,841
What the...

1864
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:19,846
Look at the view.

1865
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:23,125
This is fun, right?

1866
01:33:24,360 --> 01:33:25,361
Good-bye.

1867
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:28,530
I got you, baby! I got you!

1868
01:33:42,280 --> 01:33:44,282
- Oh, my God, help me.
- Hi, Patty.

1869
01:33:48,600 --> 01:33:50,284
Hell no! The Devil is a liar!

1870
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:53,846
Hellion, begone!

1871
01:33:54,760 --> 01:33:56,091
Shit.

1872
01:33:56,640 --> 01:33:57,801
No!

1873
01:33:59,480 --> 01:34:01,721
Holtzy! Got you, Holtzy!

1874
01:34:03,360 --> 01:34:04,441
No!

1875
01:34:04,520 --> 01:34:06,727
Get out of my friend, ghost!

1876
01:34:12,040 --> 01:34:13,530
That's gonna leave a mark!

1877
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:16,206
The power of Patty compels you!

1878
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:19,367
Is that you, Abby?

1879
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:20,487
Where did he go?

1880
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:21,925
Hey, guys, check it out!

1881
01:34:22,080 --> 01:34:23,161
Hey, listen.

1882
01:34:23,240 --> 01:34:26,005
I figured you're gonna need my help,
so I borrowed all this stuff.

1883
01:34:26,080 --> 01:34:28,924
If you could just chuck me down
my own proton pack, that'd be great.

1884
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:30,490
- Kevin, come inside!
- Kevin.

1885
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:31,681
- Come inside.
- I'm part of the team.

1886
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:32,921
I can help out.
I'm not gonna get in your way.

1887
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,206
- Come on, move!
- Move!

1888
01:34:34,280 --> 01:34:35,850
I was born to be a Ghostbuster, all right?

1889
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:36,921
Nothing's gonna stop me!

1890
01:34:40,240 --> 01:34:41,685
- Man.
- Kevin!

1891
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:43,489
Come on, Rowan, get out of him!

1892
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:45,164
Thanks for the upgrade.

1893
01:34:45,680 --> 01:34:47,091
Rowan, ya big bully!

1894
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:50,003
Hope this guy knows
how to ride a motorcycle.

1895
01:34:50,120 --> 01:34:51,406
Rowan, not Kevin!

1896
01:34:52,360 --> 01:34:53,600
Yeah, he does.

1897
01:34:55,760 --> 01:34:57,285
That's so not good.

1898
01:35:04,120 --> 01:35:06,646
No, no. It's just a magic trick.
He didn't actually cut her in half.

1899
01:35:06,760 --> 01:35:09,127
- No, no. I was there. She was cut in half.
- There's two women.

1900
01:35:09,200 --> 01:35:10,804
- Yeah, I saw it.
- It's just a trick.

1901
01:35:11,480 --> 01:35:12,811
Mayor Bradley, it's me!

1902
01:35:13,640 --> 01:35:15,642
Who the shit is this?

1903
01:35:15,720 --> 01:35:17,449
It's me! It's Erin.

1904
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:19,409
She thinks that's a sliding door.

1905
01:35:19,480 --> 01:35:20,641
It's Erin. Hi!

1906
01:35:20,720 --> 01:35:23,041
She thinks they're all doors. That's sad.

1907
01:35:23,120 --> 01:35:24,565
She's a scientist.

1908
01:35:24,640 --> 01:35:26,130
Mayor Bradley.

1909
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:28,291
You have to evacuate the city!

1910
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:29,447
Never say that word.

1911
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:30,885
You have to shut down the power
to the whole city!

1912
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:33,691
Don't you understand? He's using
the power to energize them!

1913
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:36,081
You know what, as you can see,
the mayor is very busy.

1914
01:35:36,160 --> 01:35:37,321
No.

1915
01:35:37,400 --> 01:35:38,526
It's happening.

1916
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:40,570
Can you hear it?

1917
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:43,686
It's...

1918
01:35:46,840 --> 01:35:48,080
Okay, that's a dumpster.

1919
01:35:48,160 --> 01:35:50,481
But the undead are still arriving.

1920
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:51,925
Please, Mayor Bradley,
you have to believe me.

1921
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,490
You're the only one
that can do something. Don't...

1922
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:55,011
Please don't be like the mayor in Jaws.

1923
01:35:56,520 --> 01:35:58,921
Never compare me to the Jaws mayor. Never!

1924
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:00,001
Please, you have to get everyone out.

1925
01:36:00,120 --> 01:36:01,167
You're endangering everyone in the city!

1926
01:36:01,240 --> 01:36:02,401
That took way too long.

1927
01:36:02,480 --> 01:36:03,527
What are you doing?

1928
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:05,125
My... Get off of me!

1929
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:08,084
Mayor Bradley, you have to listen to me!

1930
01:36:08,160 --> 01:36:11,050
Get out of the city! Get out of the city!

1931
01:36:11,160 --> 01:36:12,685
They're coming!

1932
01:36:12,760 --> 01:36:15,127
Don't you understand?
These ghosts kill people!

1933
01:36:24,160 --> 01:36:25,969
50 cents a T-shirt.

1934
01:36:26,040 --> 01:36:28,088
My plan is to wear a new one every day,

1935
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:31,482
and then just throw 'em out
and then start over every month, yeah.

1936
01:36:32,480 --> 01:36:34,960
Hey. Man, nobody ordered
a Clark Kent strippergram.

1937
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:36,246
Clark Kent?

1938
01:36:37,040 --> 01:36:39,407
Because of the glasses
and the handsomeness?

1939
01:36:50,120 --> 01:36:52,521
I should have worked out more
when I was alive.

1940
01:37:03,160 --> 01:37:05,527
I definitely should have worked out more.

1941
01:37:40,720 --> 01:37:42,961
You have to get out of the city!

1942
01:37:43,960 --> 01:37:45,769
Please! Get out!

1943
01:37:47,880 --> 01:37:48,961
No.

1944
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:51,285
It's happening.

1945
01:38:45,080 --> 01:38:47,321
City College must have just let out, huh?

1946
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:50,521
Yankees suck!

1947
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:55,364
What the hell am I doing in New York?

1948
01:38:56,720 --> 01:38:57,721
Let's do this!

1949
01:38:58,160 --> 01:38:59,161
Yeah.

1950
01:39:07,560 --> 01:39:09,403
Taxi! Taxi!

1951
01:39:12,360 --> 01:39:14,408
- Where you going?
- Chinatown.

1952
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:16,847
Nah. That's, like,
one more block south than I want to go.

1953
01:39:16,920 --> 01:39:19,491
Sir, those are actual ghosts flying around!

1954
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:21,961
They're Class 5 floating vapors.
Nothing to worry about.

1955
01:39:22,040 --> 01:39:24,247
No, no, no, it's important.
Don't you see what's happening?

1956
01:39:24,320 --> 01:39:25,446
Look, I don't go to Chinatown,

1957
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:28,040
I don't drive wackos,
and I ain't afraid of no ghosts.

1958
01:39:28,120 --> 01:39:29,645
What? No, no, no, wait!

1959
01:39:30,120 --> 01:39:32,009
That's a double negative!

1960
01:39:32,280 --> 01:39:33,964
That means you are afraid of ghosts.

1961
01:39:34,880 --> 01:39:36,291
God, I got to get my gear.

1962
01:39:46,040 --> 01:39:47,644
Seem to have hit an impasse.

1963
01:39:47,720 --> 01:39:49,131
Yeah, I'd say so.

1964
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:54,004
All right, let's clear a path.

1965
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:56,322
You guys, this looks like my kitchen.

1966
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:11,126
What the hell is that thing?

1967
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:18,120
- Hey, hey!
- Wait!

1968
01:40:18,240 --> 01:40:19,571
Really?

1969
01:40:19,640 --> 01:40:21,290
Did you leave the keys in the car?

1970
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:29,042
My uncle is gonna be pissed.

1971
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:34,964
- Okay, light him up!
- No, don't shoot.

1972
01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:37,042
The equipment on top of that
is basically a nuclear reactor.

1973
01:40:37,120 --> 01:40:39,361
- What?
- Okay, I vote we don't shoot at that.

1974
01:40:54,560 --> 01:40:56,722
Well, we just gave a ghost a nuke.

1975
01:40:56,800 --> 01:40:58,404
We should probably run.

1976
01:40:58,640 --> 01:40:59,641
Yep.

1977
01:41:00,600 --> 01:41:01,965
Go! Go! Moving out!

1978
01:41:23,280 --> 01:41:26,807
Yo, was Thanksgiving
like Halloween back in the 1920s?

1979
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:29,042
'Cause that's a creepy-ass Macy's Parade.

1980
01:41:29,120 --> 01:41:33,444
I don't know. I've always kind of been
attracted to husky men in hats.

1981
01:41:35,320 --> 01:41:36,970
I just made eye contact.

1982
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:38,690
- With the balloon?
- Yeah, straight down the barrel.

1983
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:45,206
- Damn.
- I think we may look like chew toys to him.

1984
01:41:45,520 --> 01:41:47,329
All right, let's pop some balloons!

1985
01:42:14,680 --> 01:42:16,284
Lord, have mercy.

1986
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:18,209
This is just wrong!

1987
01:42:18,600 --> 01:42:20,807
I can't move my hand.

1988
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:22,962
I can't reach the trigger.

1989
01:42:23,800 --> 01:42:26,883
You guys, this is exactly
how I pictured my death.

1990
01:42:37,080 --> 01:42:38,241
Come on.

1991
01:42:39,320 --> 01:42:41,049
Proton guns are all well and good,

1992
01:42:41,120 --> 01:42:43,885
but sometimes you need the Swiss Army.

1993
01:42:45,280 --> 01:42:46,850
Welcome back!

1994
01:42:47,240 --> 01:42:49,083
- Am I shouting?
- Yeah.

1995
01:42:49,520 --> 01:42:52,171
I think the balloon popped my ear!

1996
01:42:52,240 --> 01:42:56,848
All right, let's go save this city
and get our terrible receptionist back.

1997
01:42:56,920 --> 01:42:58,922
We're not gonna find another one that pretty.

1998
01:43:13,400 --> 01:43:14,811
Who's the flying beefcake?

1999
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:18,441
Hello.

2000
01:43:18,760 --> 01:43:23,084
Dear brave men and women
of the protection services industry,

2001
01:43:23,480 --> 01:43:26,290
I would like to see you dance.

2002
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:31,961
Get it off.

2003
01:43:32,040 --> 01:43:33,121
I can't. It won't work anymore.

2004
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:42,883
I control all of you.

2005
01:43:55,480 --> 01:43:56,481
This is fun.

2006
01:44:02,840 --> 01:44:04,444
Women. Always late.

2007
01:44:05,960 --> 01:44:08,486
Probably couldn't decide
which dirty jumpsuit to wear.

2008
01:44:09,760 --> 01:44:12,411
Let's give 'em a proper New York welcome,
shall we?

2009
01:44:15,240 --> 01:44:18,005
Welcome to the glory days of New York City.

2010
01:44:18,080 --> 01:44:19,127
Have fun!

2011
01:44:32,640 --> 01:44:34,051
Never been good in a fight.

2012
01:44:34,600 --> 01:44:35,761
Well, good news.

2013
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:37,683
Here's your chance to work on that.

2014
01:44:40,600 --> 01:44:42,443
Guys, you all have your sidearms.

2015
01:44:42,520 --> 01:44:44,170
I suggest you use them.

2016
01:44:44,240 --> 01:44:45,651
Okay, power up.

2017
01:45:05,120 --> 01:45:06,485
Holtzy, get down! Get down!

2018
01:45:12,600 --> 01:45:13,601
Slap shot!

2019
01:45:14,760 --> 01:45:15,761
Gotcha.

2020
01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:21,169
This isn't very Puritan behavior!

2021
01:45:25,080 --> 01:45:26,320
D'oh. Nuts!

2022
01:45:32,640 --> 01:45:33,926
I'm getting the hang of this!

2023
01:45:37,120 --> 01:45:38,121
Shoot.

2024
01:45:38,200 --> 01:45:39,850
I lost my glasses!

2025
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:42,207
Wait, wait, I got 'em! They're in my hand!

2026
01:45:42,280 --> 01:45:43,361
A little help!

2027
01:45:52,520 --> 01:45:53,646
Impressive.

2028
01:45:57,120 --> 01:45:58,884
Holtzy! I got you!

2029
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:02,322
It's chipping time now, ghost.

2030
01:46:04,240 --> 01:46:06,607
And this is what you get for sitting on me!

2031
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:09,047
Missed me!

2032
01:46:09,120 --> 01:46:10,201
Thanks, Patty.

2033
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:23,206
Not you guys again!

2034
01:46:25,600 --> 01:46:27,204
Say hello to my little...

2035
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:31,331
What the hell?

2036
01:46:36,480 --> 01:46:38,005
Forgot about my new toys.

2037
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:42,161
Let's go.

2038
01:47:09,920 --> 01:47:12,207
You just got Holtzmanned, baby!

2039
01:47:12,720 --> 01:47:13,767
You know what?

2040
01:47:13,840 --> 01:47:16,286
I'm glad I didn't know
any of you when you were alive,

2041
01:47:16,360 --> 01:47:18,647
'cause I don't enjoy any of you,
especially you.

2042
01:47:18,720 --> 01:47:20,643
Okay. All right, Abby,
let's reel it in tighter.

2043
01:47:20,720 --> 01:47:23,041
- I don't like you either!
- We got to save our energy.

2044
01:47:23,120 --> 01:47:24,610
Come on, let's go.

2045
01:47:26,600 --> 01:47:28,967
Oh, my God, you killed a Pilgrim.

2046
01:47:29,400 --> 01:47:30,731
It appears I did.

2047
01:47:39,160 --> 01:47:41,162
- This is weird.
- It sure is.

2048
01:47:41,280 --> 01:47:43,248
Hey, why y'all like this?

2049
01:47:43,480 --> 01:47:44,970
Something's up, man.

2050
01:47:47,720 --> 01:47:49,529
Yeah, great work, fellas.

2051
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:51,204
Your country thanks you.

2052
01:48:00,600 --> 01:48:03,251
Well, that thing's having
the time of its life.

2053
01:48:04,440 --> 01:48:05,487
Let's go.

2054
01:48:29,800 --> 01:48:30,847
God.

2055
01:48:32,280 --> 01:48:34,647
It feels like the slime
is after me, personally.

2056
01:48:35,120 --> 01:48:36,406
That's all I'm saying.

2057
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:37,811
This might be a crazy hunch,

2058
01:48:37,880 --> 01:48:40,247
but I think he's got that machine
up and running again.

2059
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:42,646
Come on.

2060
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:49,811
Damn, I missed.

2061
01:48:50,080 --> 01:48:51,002
Kevin!

2062
01:48:52,160 --> 01:48:53,969
Is that what this thing's name is?

2063
01:48:54,040 --> 01:48:59,206
Thought it'd be something more Australian
like "Jack-O" or "Dave-O" or "Rob-O."

2064
01:48:59,280 --> 01:49:01,806
I see there's five of you now.

2065
01:49:05,600 --> 01:49:06,886
Who are you?

2066
01:49:06,960 --> 01:49:08,564
I'm Frank.

2067
01:49:09,560 --> 01:49:11,403
I just came down to get some ice.

2068
01:49:11,880 --> 01:49:13,405
Get out of here!

2069
01:49:13,760 --> 01:49:15,171
Get out of here!

2070
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:23,561
I think we should've gave him a heads up
about what was going on out there, y'all.

2071
01:49:24,160 --> 01:49:26,288
It's been a very long day.
Why don't you take a seat?

2072
01:49:27,800 --> 01:49:28,801
Please, sit.

2073
01:49:28,880 --> 01:49:30,006
Don't mind if I do.

2074
01:49:33,480 --> 01:49:34,481
Okay.

2075
01:49:35,440 --> 01:49:37,249
I do appreciate the joke. It's a classic.

2076
01:49:37,320 --> 01:49:38,651
For fun.

2077
01:49:38,840 --> 01:49:41,446
I know you're getting real comfy
in your Kevin skin suit,

2078
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:42,885
but it's time you hop out.

2079
01:49:43,320 --> 01:49:46,961
We like him,
despite his many, many frustrating quirks.

2080
01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:49,646
- He just started figuring out the phones!
- Yeah.

2081
01:49:50,520 --> 01:49:51,681
I don't know.

2082
01:49:53,160 --> 01:49:55,083
Is this a little too Peter Pan?

2083
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:57,161
Anyway, I'll embrace it.

2084
01:50:00,520 --> 01:50:01,601
You know, to be honest with you,

2085
01:50:01,680 --> 01:50:03,887
this guy's making me feel
stupider by the second.

2086
01:50:04,040 --> 01:50:05,007
He's all yours.

2087
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:06,966
- No!
- No, no, no!

2088
01:50:09,840 --> 01:50:11,649
Don't let Rowan get away!

2089
01:50:11,720 --> 01:50:13,609
I got his ass! Here I am.

2090
01:50:14,560 --> 01:50:17,882
Nobody hurts Kevin, man!
Nobody hurts Kevin!

2091
01:50:17,960 --> 01:50:20,884
Come out, come out wherever you are

2092
01:50:20,960 --> 01:50:22,007
Over here.

2093
01:50:24,080 --> 01:50:25,366
Those guns come with instructions?

2094
01:50:25,440 --> 01:50:28,728
Come on, Rowan! Come get your virginity
out of the lost-and-found!

2095
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:30,609
- You shoot like girls.
- 12 o'clock!

2096
01:50:38,480 --> 01:50:39,527
I think you broke it.

2097
01:50:39,600 --> 01:50:40,931
Look what you made me do!

2098
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:42,650
It's ridiculous. Let's get Kevin.

2099
01:50:44,160 --> 01:50:45,969
I knew he was dumb as a box of rocks.

2100
01:50:46,040 --> 01:50:48,486
I didn't know he's as heavy as one.
What's he made out of?

2101
01:50:48,560 --> 01:50:50,449
Pure muscle. And baby-soft skin.

2102
01:50:51,680 --> 01:50:53,603
Come on, Rowan, show yourself!

2103
01:50:54,160 --> 01:50:56,049
What form would you prefer I take?

2104
01:50:56,120 --> 01:50:58,805
Maybe something stationary.
Like a bull's-eye.

2105
01:50:58,920 --> 01:51:00,570
Well, I'll tell you what I prefer.

2106
01:51:00,640 --> 01:51:04,008
I prefer something nice and cute,
like a friendly little ghost.

2107
01:51:05,480 --> 01:51:06,891
Is this what you want?

2108
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:08,325
Something more familiar?

2109
01:51:08,680 --> 01:51:09,966
Ice cream.

2110
01:51:10,480 --> 01:51:12,244
Well, you know what,
I don't have no problem with that.

2111
01:51:12,320 --> 01:51:13,970
Thank you very much for being reasonable.

2112
01:51:14,040 --> 01:51:16,361
If this is what you want, it works for me.

2113
01:51:18,280 --> 01:51:20,487
God, he's really going for it.

2114
01:51:20,560 --> 01:51:22,722
Man, I said cute. Cute!

2115
01:51:22,800 --> 01:51:23,961
God.

2116
01:51:24,520 --> 01:51:27,091
No. No, no, no.

2117
01:51:27,200 --> 01:51:28,201
No.

2118
01:51:29,640 --> 01:51:31,165
Okay, this is not good.

2119
01:51:48,320 --> 01:51:50,846
Run! Run!

2120
01:52:22,360 --> 01:52:23,521
Come on!

2121
01:52:24,520 --> 01:52:25,681
Erin!

2122
01:52:32,360 --> 01:52:35,364
Okay. Homeboy is pretty much
not keeping up with what we agreed upon.

2123
01:52:38,480 --> 01:52:42,007
What part of "small and friendly"
did he not understand?

2124
01:52:48,480 --> 01:52:49,766
What do we do now?

2125
01:52:49,840 --> 01:52:52,764
We gotta go back there. We've got to
shoot directly in the portal with more power.

2126
01:52:52,840 --> 01:52:55,081
If we can do that, we might be able
to cause a reverse reaction.

2127
01:52:55,160 --> 01:52:56,525
We gotta cross the streams.

2128
01:52:56,600 --> 01:52:59,444
Wait, wait, wait. You mean that thing
you were talking about that's so powerful

2129
01:52:59,520 --> 01:53:01,284
that will make all of our atoms implode?

2130
01:53:01,360 --> 01:53:03,601
No, implode is the wrong word.
It'll be more violent than that.

2131
01:53:03,680 --> 01:53:06,047
We gotta cross 'em up,
and we've got an extremely good shot

2132
01:53:06,120 --> 01:53:09,681
at pulling all the ionized ecto-matter
back into the dimension of its origin.

2133
01:53:09,800 --> 01:53:11,928
So, on the plus side, we save the world.

2134
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:16,210
And on the negative side, we experience the
most painful death conceivable of all time.

2135
01:53:16,400 --> 01:53:18,448
Yeah. It's hard to shine
that penny, but yeah.

2136
01:53:18,760 --> 01:53:19,761
Okay.

2137
01:53:20,320 --> 01:53:21,321
Let's do it.

2138
01:53:21,400 --> 01:53:24,085
Attagirl. Okay, let's go. Go, go, go.

2139
01:53:39,840 --> 01:53:41,251
All right, fire 'em up.

2140
01:54:06,320 --> 01:54:07,367
The portal's too strong.

2141
01:54:07,440 --> 01:54:09,886
We still don't have enough power
to reverse it.

2142
01:54:15,160 --> 01:54:17,766
Yo, what about that nuclear thing
on top of the car?

2143
01:54:17,840 --> 01:54:20,844
If we can get those reactors
super-critical inside the vortex,

2144
01:54:20,920 --> 01:54:23,207
the beta radiation could 180 the polarity.

2145
01:54:23,280 --> 01:54:25,487
Causing a total protonic reversal.

2146
01:54:25,560 --> 01:54:27,688
It's gonna turn that portal
into a giant ghost trap.

2147
01:54:27,760 --> 01:54:29,444
You are a genius, Patty.

2148
01:54:29,680 --> 01:54:30,920
I'm a Ghostbuster.

2149
01:54:31,640 --> 01:54:33,563
All right, let's narrow his path.

2150
01:54:41,640 --> 01:54:43,085
Aim for the silver canisters.

2151
01:55:05,080 --> 01:55:06,206
It's working!

2152
01:55:18,240 --> 01:55:19,287
He's too strong.

2153
01:55:19,360 --> 01:55:21,806
We can't let the portal close
with him still here.

2154
01:55:21,880 --> 01:55:22,927
All right, ladies.

2155
01:55:23,760 --> 01:55:24,966
Let's loosen his grip.

2156
01:55:34,280 --> 01:55:35,645
Yo, that's where
you wanted us to shoot, right?

2157
01:55:35,720 --> 01:55:36,926
Yes.

2158
01:55:44,920 --> 01:55:46,081
Look out!

2159
01:55:47,520 --> 01:55:48,601
Abby!

2160
01:56:06,760 --> 01:56:08,046
The portal's closing!

2161
01:56:08,120 --> 01:56:10,646
- Abby, hang on! I'm coming!
- What is she doing?

2162
01:56:17,280 --> 01:56:18,327
Hang on, Abby!

2163
01:56:47,200 --> 01:56:48,531
Abby!

2164
01:56:57,880 --> 01:56:58,927
Erin.

2165
01:56:59,920 --> 01:57:01,490
I wasn't gonna leave you twice.

2166
01:57:01,800 --> 01:57:02,926
Yeah.

2167
01:57:05,680 --> 01:57:06,761
Hold on!

2168
01:57:10,240 --> 01:57:12,163
- Oh, my God.
- We got to get 'em out of there.

2169
01:57:12,240 --> 01:57:13,446
We got to get 'em out of there!

2170
01:57:38,920 --> 01:57:40,331
Shut up!

2171
01:57:40,880 --> 01:57:41,881
Yeah!

2172
01:57:42,680 --> 01:57:43,727
Hell yeah!

2173
01:57:45,840 --> 01:57:48,081
Yeah! Yeah!

2174
01:57:48,160 --> 01:57:49,969
Oh, my God! Oh, my God.

2175
01:57:50,080 --> 01:57:51,081
Oh, my God!

2176
01:57:52,240 --> 01:57:53,401
Yeah! Yeah!

2177
01:57:54,440 --> 01:57:55,805
- What's "whoa"?
- Yes.

2178
01:57:55,920 --> 01:57:57,081
No!

2179
01:57:58,440 --> 01:57:59,566
My...

2180
01:58:00,520 --> 01:58:01,760
My gosh.

2181
01:58:04,240 --> 01:58:05,810
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

2182
01:58:05,880 --> 01:58:07,120
My gosh!

2183
01:58:08,320 --> 01:58:09,560
What year is it?

2184
01:58:09,640 --> 01:58:10,846
- It's 2040.
- What?

2185
01:58:10,920 --> 01:58:13,207
- Our president is a plant.
- Oh, my God!

2186
01:58:13,280 --> 01:58:14,884
I'm kidding. You were gone two seconds.

2187
01:58:14,960 --> 01:58:16,325
- We did it?
- Yeah.

2188
01:58:16,440 --> 01:58:18,249
- Yeah, you did it.
- Yep.

2189
01:58:18,360 --> 01:58:19,691
- We all did it.
- We all did it.

2190
01:58:19,760 --> 01:58:21,444
- We all did it.
- That's right.

2191
01:58:21,520 --> 01:58:23,284
- We all did it.
- Well...

2192
01:58:24,320 --> 01:58:26,402
What did you do, Kevin?

2193
01:58:26,480 --> 01:58:27,686
I did a lot, actually.

2194
01:58:27,760 --> 01:58:29,603
I'll have you know that
I walked over to the power box,

2195
01:58:29,680 --> 01:58:30,841
pushed a bunch of buttons.

2196
01:58:30,920 --> 01:58:33,491
Everything got sucked into the portal,
then it closed up.

2197
01:58:33,560 --> 01:58:34,846
- Kev.
- That's...

2198
01:58:34,960 --> 01:58:37,122
Sweet, sweet Kev. The two are unrelated.

2199
01:58:38,440 --> 01:58:41,523
More important question.
When did you have time to get a sandwich?

2200
01:58:41,720 --> 01:58:43,961
When I was looking for you guys,
I looked in that deli over there.

2201
01:58:44,040 --> 01:58:47,681
When we were risking our lives,
trying to save New York City,

2202
01:58:47,760 --> 01:58:49,808
you stopped in to get a sandwich?

2203
01:58:49,880 --> 01:58:51,484
Quit splitting hairs, okay?

2204
01:58:51,600 --> 01:58:53,170
Potatoes, tomatoes. It doesn't matter.

2205
01:58:53,240 --> 01:58:55,004
Point is, the Ghostbusters...

2206
01:58:55,880 --> 01:58:57,211
Are back together again, okay?

2207
01:58:57,280 --> 01:58:58,441
And that's what friends are for.

2208
01:59:00,600 --> 01:59:02,489
- Just glad you okay, man.
- Kevin!

2209
01:59:02,560 --> 01:59:04,289
Yes. Hold my hand longer.

2210
01:59:04,360 --> 01:59:05,930
Okay. Okay. Okay.

2211
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,401
I love the hair, by the way.
Makes you look a lot older.

2212
01:59:08,480 --> 01:59:09,561
You know what?

2213
01:59:11,560 --> 01:59:12,846
A little help, please?

2214
01:59:16,320 --> 01:59:17,321
Really?

2215
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:21,650
Can I have the beverage, please?

2216
01:59:21,720 --> 01:59:22,721
Don't.

2217
01:59:26,200 --> 01:59:27,406
And a muffin, thanks.

2218
01:59:28,240 --> 01:59:29,241
Oh, my God.

2219
01:59:30,080 --> 01:59:31,491
Are you a wizard?

2220
01:59:31,800 --> 01:59:33,290
In the aftermath of the events,

2221
01:59:33,360 --> 01:59:35,010
authorities are still trying to understand

2222
01:59:35,080 --> 01:59:37,924
what happened in Times Square
and throughout the city.

2223
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,241
I saw Pilgrims. Ghost Pilgrims.

2224
01:59:40,520 --> 01:59:44,206
So you're honestly gonna stand here
and tell me that we didn't all see ghosts,

2225
01:59:44,320 --> 01:59:45,970
that what actually happened

2226
01:59:46,040 --> 01:59:48,771
was that terrorists drugged all of the water
with hallucinogens.

2227
01:59:48,840 --> 01:59:49,921
Yes. Yes.

2228
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:51,331
Wait, what?

2229
01:59:51,400 --> 01:59:53,084
- Baba Booey!
- I... I...

2230
01:59:53,320 --> 01:59:56,642
...with the government trying to claim
the event wasn't supernatural,

2231
01:59:56,720 --> 02:00:00,008
despite so many eyewitness accounts
to the contrary.

2232
02:00:00,080 --> 02:00:01,286
The big question is,

2233
02:00:01,360 --> 02:00:05,046
was it the four women
who refer to themselves as Ghostbusters

2234
02:00:05,120 --> 02:00:06,963
who actually thwarted the attack?

2235
02:00:07,040 --> 02:00:08,007
We may never know.

2236
02:00:08,080 --> 02:00:10,048
Well, now I know how Batman feels.

2237
02:00:11,880 --> 02:00:13,928
You know what?
You don't have to keep fiddling with it.

2238
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,731
I think it looks nice. Right?

2239
02:00:16,880 --> 02:00:18,484
I'd talk to you at an AA meeting.

2240
02:00:19,480 --> 02:00:20,481
It's my fault, anyway.

2241
02:00:20,560 --> 02:00:22,210
The box said the color was called Garfield.

2242
02:00:23,720 --> 02:00:26,166
It wasn't even the cat. It was the president.

2243
02:00:27,320 --> 02:00:29,527
It was part of
the Dead Presidents Color Collection.

2244
02:00:29,600 --> 02:00:31,284
You stay away from Taft.

2245
02:00:31,360 --> 02:00:34,250
That's my mother's color.
I don't want to see that on anyone's head.

2246
02:00:34,320 --> 02:00:36,482
Mine was "Woman with a Secret."

2247
02:00:37,320 --> 02:00:39,084
And she was kind of going...

2248
02:00:39,160 --> 02:00:41,003
And she appeared to be in a canoe.

2249
02:00:41,080 --> 02:00:43,082
You know what, I want to make a toast.

2250
02:00:45,480 --> 02:00:46,970
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

2251
02:00:47,840 --> 02:00:51,561
Physics is the study of
the movement of bodies in space,

2252
02:00:51,680 --> 02:00:54,968
and it can unlock the mysteries
of the universe.

2253
02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:59,682
But it cannot answer the essential question
of what is our purpose here.

2254
02:00:59,760 --> 02:01:03,128
And, to me, the purpose of life is to love.

2255
02:01:03,200 --> 02:01:06,761
And to love is what you have shown me.

2256
02:01:06,840 --> 02:01:09,764
I didn't think that I would
ever really have a friend until I met Abby,

2257
02:01:09,840 --> 02:01:12,127
and then I feel like
I have a family of my own.

2258
02:01:12,240 --> 02:01:13,685
And I love you. Thank you.

2259
02:01:14,360 --> 02:01:15,327
Thank you.

2260
02:01:15,840 --> 02:01:17,171
I mean, that was like
a real thing right there.

2261
02:01:17,240 --> 02:01:19,049
- Yeah, that was...
- That was, like, so real.

2262
02:01:19,120 --> 02:01:20,884
I'm so sorry I'm late.

2263
02:01:22,520 --> 02:01:25,444
We want to thank you for your discretion.

2264
02:01:25,520 --> 02:01:28,171
It's not working at all, but thank you.

2265
02:01:28,240 --> 02:01:32,245
Actually, we'd like you to continue
to study this subject,

2266
02:01:32,320 --> 02:01:33,890
fully funded.

2267
02:01:33,960 --> 02:01:37,089
You know, we need to be better prepared,
just in case.

2268
02:01:37,160 --> 02:01:38,810
- Yeah. Yes, that's smart.
- Yes.

2269
02:01:38,880 --> 02:01:40,848
Whatever you need, going forward.

2270
02:01:40,920 --> 02:01:42,126
Anything at all.

2271
02:01:43,280 --> 02:01:44,441
Anything?

2272
02:01:45,560 --> 02:01:46,641
Anything.

2273
02:01:46,720 --> 02:01:47,767
Hell yeah!

2274
02:01:49,560 --> 02:01:50,607
Second floor is mine.

2275
02:01:50,680 --> 02:01:52,523
You can't claim a whole floor.

2276
02:01:52,600 --> 02:01:53,647
- I just did.
- You can't...

2277
02:01:53,720 --> 02:01:55,449
You can't do that, Holtzy!

2278
02:01:55,760 --> 02:01:57,410
Not bad, ghost girl.

2279
02:01:57,480 --> 02:01:59,562
Thank you, and I proudly take that title.

2280
02:02:04,120 --> 02:02:05,884
- Is that...
- Patty's uncle.

2281
02:02:10,200 --> 02:02:11,361
Unc!

2282
02:02:12,160 --> 02:02:13,207
Where is it?

2283
02:02:13,720 --> 02:02:15,529
What are you talking about?
I told you what happened.

2284
02:02:15,600 --> 02:02:16,886
Where's the car?

2285
02:02:16,960 --> 02:02:19,327
- It's on the other side.
- In Jersey?

2286
02:02:19,400 --> 02:02:21,004
No, in the portal.

2287
02:02:22,040 --> 02:02:24,691
You know what? We should probably
let them just work this out.

2288
02:02:24,760 --> 02:02:25,727
- Excuse me.
- Patty,

2289
02:02:25,800 --> 02:02:27,689
I got four funerals this weekend.

2290
02:02:27,760 --> 02:02:29,489
I can't do them with just one hearse.

2291
02:02:29,560 --> 02:02:31,085
Maybe you could do two at a time.

2292
02:02:31,160 --> 02:02:32,685
We're not stacking 'em like flapjacks!

2293
02:02:45,120 --> 02:02:46,849
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

2294
02:02:46,960 --> 02:02:48,246
I know what you did.

2295
02:02:48,480 --> 02:02:49,641
What?

2296
02:02:49,720 --> 02:02:52,405
Bennie, don't get weird on me, okay?

2297
02:02:53,760 --> 02:02:54,966
What is...

2298
02:02:55,400 --> 02:02:57,004
Yeah!

2299
02:02:57,080 --> 02:03:01,369
I'm just looking for a reasonable ratio
of wontons to broth.

2300
02:03:01,440 --> 02:03:02,965
This is absolute madness.

2301
02:03:03,120 --> 02:03:05,726
Come on, girl.
You deserve every wonton in the world.

2302
02:03:05,800 --> 02:03:07,882
Don't let any man tell you otherwise.

2303
02:03:07,960 --> 02:03:08,961
- Okay, you can go.
- All right.

2304
02:03:09,040 --> 02:03:10,280
- We still good for brunch?
- Nope.

2305
02:03:10,400 --> 02:03:11,401
Just go.

2306
02:03:26,840 --> 02:03:29,923
Ghostbusters. Please give
a detailed description of your apparition.

2307
02:03:30,880 --> 02:03:32,405
Well, that sounds like

2308
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:36,804
an illusional meta-physious, spectro-mian.

2309
02:03:38,040 --> 02:03:39,690
I'm talking like you guys.

2310
02:03:39,760 --> 02:03:41,091
- Way to go, Kev.
- Yeah.

2311
02:03:41,160 --> 02:03:43,322
Well, that sounds very scary.

2312
02:03:43,400 --> 02:03:46,722
It's probably 'cause you got
a lot of bad karma from your previous life.

2313
02:03:48,680 --> 02:03:49,920
I hate coffee.

2314
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:51,889
I'm just gonna disconnect his phone.

2315
02:03:51,960 --> 02:03:53,200
- He won't notice.
- No.

2316
02:04:09,280 --> 02:04:10,964
How's it going over here?

2317
02:04:11,960 --> 02:04:12,961
Good. Really good.

2318
02:04:13,040 --> 02:04:16,169
I'm working on some kind of next-level stuff.

2319
02:04:16,240 --> 02:04:17,446
Case in point.

2320
02:04:22,800 --> 02:04:23,801
What is this for?

2321
02:04:23,880 --> 02:04:26,963
It catches ghosts
and it transports them somewhere else.

2322
02:04:27,040 --> 02:04:28,371
I don't know where,

2323
02:04:28,480 --> 02:04:30,960
but I have a feeling it's Michigan.

2324
02:04:32,480 --> 02:04:34,050
Sorry, Lansing.

2325
02:04:45,760 --> 02:04:47,649
Hey, how's this containment unit?

2326
02:04:47,720 --> 02:04:49,131
You got that up and going?

2327
02:04:49,200 --> 02:04:51,407
That? That's going real smooth.

2328
02:04:52,080 --> 02:04:56,210
I just would say don't be in a room with it
for more than an hour at a time,

2329
02:04:56,280 --> 02:04:59,602
because I'm thinking a lot of hair loss.

2330
02:04:59,720 --> 02:05:02,291
Well, that might be
something we want to work on.

2331
02:05:03,400 --> 02:05:05,971
Hi. Hello. Sorry, I didn't know
anyone else was here.

2332
02:05:06,040 --> 02:05:07,565
What a ding-a-ling. I forgot to introduce.

2333
02:05:07,640 --> 02:05:09,961
This is my mentor, Dr. Rebecca Gorin.

2334
02:05:10,560 --> 02:05:12,324
This is reckless, Jillian.

2335
02:05:12,600 --> 02:05:14,090
All someone has to do is sneeze too hard

2336
02:05:14,160 --> 02:05:16,527
and everyone in this building
is going to disintegrate.

2337
02:05:16,760 --> 02:05:19,001
It's completely unstable.

2338
02:05:19,080 --> 02:05:20,684
Do we need this safety light?

2339
02:05:20,760 --> 02:05:24,924
Safety lights are for dudes.

2340
02:05:27,440 --> 02:05:28,487
I hate doing that.

2341
02:05:29,360 --> 02:05:32,284
Hey, y'all need to come check this out.
Come up to the roof.

2342
02:05:42,560 --> 02:05:43,891
Is that for us?

2343
02:05:44,520 --> 02:05:47,126
I guess some people
actually do know what we did.

2344
02:05:48,200 --> 02:05:49,964
Well, that's not terrible.

2345
02:05:50,520 --> 02:05:51,965
No, it's not.

2346
02:05:52,040 --> 02:05:53,530
It's not terrible at all.

2347
02:13:11,200 --> 02:13:12,964
I call it the nutcracker.

2348
02:13:13,480 --> 02:13:14,970
'Cause it crushes the ghost.

2349
02:13:15,040 --> 02:13:16,371
No, it's for walnuts.

2350
02:13:19,320 --> 02:13:20,526
Smart.

2351
02:13:25,720 --> 02:13:27,882
What is it? Did you get something?

2352
02:13:27,960 --> 02:13:30,611
Yeah. I heard something really weird.

2353
02:13:32,560 --> 02:13:33,891
What's "Zuul"?

2354
02:13:34,305 --> 02:14:34,855
