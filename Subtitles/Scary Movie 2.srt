00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:22,917
Free paper. Ha ha!
Shit, son.

170
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:25,208
Yeah, so how
you digging college?

171
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,458
I don't know.

172
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,958
It's OK, I guess.

173
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,333
I feel like such a geek
sometimes, though.

174
00:08:31,334 --> 00:08:33,917
Everyone is so cool,
and I'm...not.

175
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:36,042
Oh, come on, Cindy.

176
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,500
You ain't that bad.

177
00:08:37,542 --> 00:08:39,500
All you need is
a little bit of flavor.

178
00:08:39,542 --> 00:08:41,083
Hmm. Maybe some new gear.

179
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:42,333
"Gear?"

180
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:43,667
That's slang for "clothing."

181
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:45,667
- Oh.
- Here. Come on.

182
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:47,083
We gonna cool you up
right now.

183
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:50,708
Don't sit like this,
first of all.

184
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,792
Don't sit like that, son.
Sit cool.

185
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,708
- OK.
- Right up, son.

186
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,792
Feel yourself, son,
like that.

187
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:58,125
Yeah. Now go like this.

188
00:08:58,167 --> 00:09:00,375
Uh. Uh, yeah.

189
00:09:00,417 --> 00:09:02,375
- That's cool.
- Yeah.

190
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:04,042
Yeah. Now stand up,
let me show you some moves.

191
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:05,125
Right, left.

192
00:09:05,167 --> 00:09:06,417
Right, left.

193
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,583
Uh, son. Uh!

194
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:09,875
BOTH: Right, left.

195
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:11,083
Right, kick.

196
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:12,125
Uh, son.

197
00:09:12,167 --> 00:09:13,375
Uh, psych.

198
00:09:13,417 --> 00:09:14,458
Throw a little bit
of slang in there.

199
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:18,292
Say, "Yo, that jacket
is tight, son. Ya mean?"

200
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:21,083
Yo, that jacket is tight, son.

201
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:22,833
- Ya mean?
- Ya mean?

202
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:25,875
Yeah, something like that.

203
00:09:25,917 --> 00:09:26,875
Throw it all together.

204
00:09:26,917 --> 00:09:28,500
OK. Right, left.

205
00:09:28,542 --> 00:09:30,208
Right, kick, uh!

206
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,375
Yo, that jacket is tight.

207
00:09:32,417 --> 00:09:35,500
Now run that shit, bitch.
Ya mean?

208
00:09:37,542 --> 00:09:39,583
That is the shit, dog.

209
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:42,667
Oh, man.
You boners aren't ready yet?

210
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,792
Dude, relax, man.
I'm telling you,

211
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,792
We'll get there on time,
all right?

212
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:48,625
Yo, dogs, what y'all think?

213
00:09:48,667 --> 00:09:50,333
Tucked in or out?

214
00:09:51,917 --> 00:09:53,083
- Out, man.
- Out, man. Come on.

215
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,583
No doubt. No doubt.
That's what I thought.

216
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:58,292
You fuckheads would be ready if
you weren't partying all night.

217
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:00,667
Come on, man.
It was so awesome.

218
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:02,042
We got so wasted, man!

219
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:03,750
I had, like, a keg myself.

220
00:10:03,792 --> 00:10:05,875
I woke up naked
in a tub of ice.

221
00:10:05,917 --> 00:10:06,958
All right!

222
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,457
Yeah, man.

223
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:11,708
Oh, shit, Ray,
you got a tattoo.

224
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,000
Oh, shit.
What's it say?

225
00:10:14,042 --> 00:10:16,208
"Ray!" Oh, man.

226
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,125
Oh, shit,
you got a tattoo, too.

227
00:10:18,126 --> 00:10:19,208
Oh, really? Dude!

228
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,083
Dude, what's it say?

229
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:22,625
"Fucked me."

230
00:10:22,667 --> 00:10:24,583
Oh, sweet, man.
"Ray..."

231
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:25,833
"Fucked me."

232
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,958
- "Ray..."
- "Fucked me."

233
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,833
BOTH: "Ray fucked me."

234
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:32,750
Yeah! Ha ha! Whoo!

235
00:10:32,792 --> 00:10:34,792
What, man?

236
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:36,083
Oh.

237
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:37,750
Wedgie moment! Ha ha!

238
00:10:37,792 --> 00:10:41,208
Come on. You're gonna give me
a yeast infection.

239
00:10:41,292 --> 00:10:42,875
Hey, girl, that jacket
is slamming.

240
00:10:42,917 --> 00:10:43,875
Thanks.

241
00:10:43,917 --> 00:10:45,042
You better be careful,
though.

242
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:46,333
Some girl
got an ass-whipping...

243
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:48,083
over a jacket
stolen earlier today.

244
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:50,417
Some people is so ghetto.

245
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:52,583
What class we got next?

246
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:53,708
Psychology.

247
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,917
Oh! Me, too! 101?

248
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:58,833
- In room 302 at 10?00?
- That's it!

249
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:01,375
Oh! Uh-uh!
No. This is too much.

250
00:11:01,417 --> 00:11:02,667
I got these psychic powers
on line.

251
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:05,208
Remind me to get
a lotto ticket tomorrow.

252
00:11:05,292 --> 00:11:07,208
Oh, don't split the pole now.

253
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:10,000
That is very, very bad luck.
My psychic told me.

254
00:11:10,042 --> 00:11:12,417
ALEX: You don't really believe
in that stuff, do you?

255
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:14,417
BRENDA: Yes, I do. Very much.

256

[ Horn honks ]

257
00:11:20,542 --> 00:11:22,208
Are these all the subjects?

258
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,333
Yes, sir.
I took the liberty of putting...

259
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:26,750
those with near-death
experiences on the very top.

260
00:11:26,751 --> 00:11:28,249
Any of them hot?

261
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:31,458
As I'm sure you are aware,
Professor...

262
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,667
subjects who are close to death
are statistically more likely...

263
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:36,417
to have
the suggestibility required...

264
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:39,458
for paranormal investigation,
which is why, of course...

265
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,375
I gave them
special consideration.

266
00:11:42,417 --> 00:11:44,000
Oh, good thinking, Dwight.

267
00:11:44,042 --> 00:11:46,417
Traumatized coeds
are a sure thing.

268
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:50,792
PROFESSOR: Ooh, I like her.

269
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:53,125
Oh, yes, sir.
That is Cindy Campbell--

270
00:11:53,167 --> 00:11:55,458
classic abandoned
personality disorder.

271
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,375
She seems guarded,
but willing.

272
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:00,042
And this?

273
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:01,708
That is Ray Wilkins, sir.

274
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,292
I couldn't quite
figure him out...

275
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:05,625
but he seemed very eager
and pleased to meet me.

276
00:12:05,667 --> 00:12:07,875
What's this?

277
00:12:07,917 --> 00:12:12,625
It's a picture that he sent
after the interview.

278
00:12:12,667 --> 00:12:15,542
Where did you find these kids?

279
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:17,083
Sir, they're all survivors...

280
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:18,708
of the Stevenston County
Massacre.

281
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:22,167
Oh, fantastic!

282
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:26,833
These kids are exactly
the catalyst we need...

283

to awaken
the spirits of Hell House.

284
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:34,000
Sir, exactly how are we going
to get them up there?

285
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:35,667
We'll tell them...

286
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:37,292
it's part of the class.

287
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:40,500
We'll say--excuse me--

288
00:12:40,542 --> 00:12:41,833
that they're participating
in a study...

289
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:44,250
of sleep disorders.

290

We are going
to make history, Dwight--

291
00:12:46,167 --> 00:12:48,542

for which you receive
an automatic grade of "A"...

298

[ Snoring ]

We are going to spend
the weekend together...

302
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:16,500
where we've established
a controlled environment...

303
00:13:16,542 --> 00:13:21,500
in which we'll study
your various sleep disorders.

304
00:13:21,542 --> 00:13:22,833
Now, I'll be passing out
directions--

- No.

- No, Dwight.
- I can do it.

Yeah.

Study? Ha!

320
00:13:58,875 --> 00:13:59,958

I'm sorry, Buddy.

323
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,375
You seem like
a really nice guy...

but I just got out of
a really bad relationship...

all the commotion...

I went in there...

What? So you think
I did this to myself?.

831
00:36:13,708 --> 00:36:16,000
No. All I'm saying
is that cats are known...

832
00:36:16,042 --> 00:36:18,083
to be very
territorial animals...

833
00:36:18,125 --> 00:36:20,125
and it's likely
that it did attack...

834
00:36:20,167 --> 00:36:22,833
but that doesn't mean
it was possessed.

this cat did attack...

Anyway, I think
she killed him...

991

Let me help you.

DWIGHT:
I don't need your help.

995
00:43:50,417 --> 00:43:51,792
I can do it myself.

OK. Professor,
uh, we need to talk.

PROFESSOR:
What is it, Dwight?

999
00:44:01,208 --> 00:44:02,292
DWIGHT: I think
you should consider...

1000
00:44:02,333 --> 00:44:04,208
cutting the experiment short.

1001
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:05,667
What?

1002
00:44:05,708 --> 00:44:08,167
This poltergeist is growing
increasingly more violent.

1003
00:44:08,168 --> 00:44:09,750
I think we're all
in danger here...

1004
00:44:09,792 --> 00:44:11,625
and I've got to put
my foot down...

1005
00:44:11,667 --> 00:44:13,333
and stand up for
what I believe in...

1006
00:44:13,334 --> 00:44:15,000
and say that
we've got to pull the plug.

1007
00:44:15,042 --> 00:44:17,292
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, Dwight.

1008

I say when we pull the plug.

1009
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:21,750
We are on the verge
of greatness...

1010

and I am this close
to getting laid.

1011
00:44:25,208 --> 00:44:26,667
Now, the bus arrives

Yes, sir.

Guys, I think
the Professor's up to something.

1017
00:44:39,833 --> 00:44:41,458
I heard Dwight
tell the Professor...

1018
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:42,792
there could be
a poltergeist in the house...

1019
00:44:42,833 --> 00:44:45,000
and that we could all
be in danger!

No. We can't go anywhere.
The gates are locked.

01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:46,832
She kept it coming

1804
01:18:46,833 --> 01:18:49,083
It was hypnotic
and so erotic

1805
01:18:49,125 --> 01:18:50,500
I tried,
but I just couldn't stop it

1806
01:18:50,542 --> 01:18:51,875
She kept it coming

1807
01:18:51,917 --> 01:18:54,250
It was hypnotic
and so erotic

1808
01:18:54,292 --> 01:18:55,917
I tried,
but I just couldn't stop it

1809
01:18:55,958 --> 01:18:57,292
She kept it coming

1810
01:18:57,333 --> 01:18:59,417
It was hypnotic
and so erotic

1811
01:18:59,458 --> 01:19:01,333
I tried,
but I just couldn't stop it

1812
01:19:01,334 --> 01:19:03,208
She kept it coming

1813
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:08,958
She kept it coming

1814
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,875
[ New song begins ]

1815
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:23,750
Ooh, when it's dark outside

1816
01:19:23,792 --> 01:19:28,458
All my fears arise

1817
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:33,375
When it's dark outside

1818
01:19:33,417 --> 01:19:36,708
All my fears

1819
01:19:36,750 --> 01:19:41,625
Sun's gone down,
the light's all gone

1820
01:19:41,667 --> 01:19:46,208
Big-ass house
and we're alone

1821
01:19:46,250 --> 01:19:48,542
I hear voices,
what I'm-a do?

1822
01:19:48,583 --> 01:19:50,958
Hear those noises,
what I'm-a do?

1823
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,792
What's my choice here,
run like a fool?

1824
01:19:53,833 --> 01:19:56,458
I'm long gone

1825
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:58,500
- Shh.
- What's that sound?

1826
01:19:58,542 --> 01:20:00,958
Everybody look
what's floating round

1827
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,958
Not too sure of what I see

1828
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,583
All I know is it's scaring me

1829
01:20:05,625 --> 01:20:12,167
Ooh, when it's dark outside

1830
01:20:12,208 --> 01:20:16,917
All my fears arise

1831
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:21,833
When it's dark outside

1832
01:20:21,875 --> 01:20:25,292
All my fears

1833
01:20:25,333 --> 01:20:27,667
And just when
you think it's over

1834
01:20:27,708 --> 01:20:32,500
Some new sound
is coming towards me

1835
01:20:32,542 --> 01:20:34,583
Getting loud

1836
01:20:34,625 --> 01:20:37,000
I hear noises,
where I'm-a go?

1837
01:20:37,042 --> 01:20:39,500
Hear those voices,
head for the door

1838
01:20:39,542 --> 01:20:42,208
What's my plan?
Don't know anymore

1839
01:20:42,250 --> 01:20:45,000
Something's wrong

1840
01:20:45,042 --> 01:20:46,750
- Shh.
- What's that sound?

1841
01:20:46,792 --> 01:20:49,708
Everybody look
what's going down

1842
01:20:49,750 --> 01:20:51,708
And why won't you let me be?

1843
01:20:51,750 --> 01:20:54,167
Go right now,
you're scaring me

1844
01:20:54,208 --> 01:21:00,708
Ooh, when it's dark outside

1845
01:21:00,750 --> 01:21:05,458
All my fears arise

1846
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:10,292
When it's dark outside

1847
01:21:10,333 --> 01:21:13,583
All my fears

1848
01:21:13,625 --> 01:21:20,167
Ooh, when it's dark outside

1849
01:21:20,208 --> 01:21:24,917
All my fears arise

1850
01:21:24,958 --> 01:21:29,750
When it's dark outside

1851
01:21:29,792 --> 01:21:34,083
All my fears

1852
01:21:34,125 --> 01:21:35,833
Here's something,
so get back

1853
01:21:35,875 --> 01:21:38,333
Shorty looking at me like,
"Yo, let me hit that"

1854
01:21:38,375 --> 01:21:40,458
Footsteps in the dark,
whatcha gone do?

1855
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:41,542
I was talking
to this chicken

1856
01:21:41,625 --> 01:21:43,000
Oh. Shit.

1857
01:21:43,042 --> 01:21:44,083
Is this a poltergeist
or a heist?

1858
01:21:44,125 --> 01:21:45,500
She robs some

1859
01:21:45,542 --> 01:21:46,708
All the jewels,
murdering tools

1860
01:21:46,750 --> 01:21:47,750
We got some

1861
01:21:47,792 --> 01:21:48,833
Like cha-cha

1862
01:21:48,875 --> 01:21:50,083
Ready to open up shop

1863
01:21:50,125 --> 01:21:51,208
Wreak havoc on the block

1864
01:21:51,250 --> 01:21:52,333
Now love it, don't stop

1865
01:21:52,375 --> 01:21:53,708
Come on

1866
01:21:53,750 --> 01:21:59,417
Ooh, when it's dark outside

1867
01:21:59,458 --> 01:22:02,875
All my fears arise

1868
01:22:02,917 --> 01:22:09,250
Ooh, when it's dark outside

1869
01:22:09,251 --> 01:22:13,958
All my fears arise

1870
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:18,792
When it's dark outside.
