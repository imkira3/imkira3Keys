00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,330
<i>It's okay, son...</i>

3
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:13,481
<i>I know you want this to be over.</i>

4
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,128
<i>I'm right here.</i>

5
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,171
<i>I will be right here...</i>

6
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,081
<i>But, you don't give up.</i>

7
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,050
<i>You hear me?</i>

8
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:51,926
<i>As long as you can still
grab a breath, you fight.</i>

9
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,967
<i>You breathe... keep breathing.</i>

10
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,851
Hawk.

11
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,082
Ah, shit.

12
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,571
Goddamn sumbitches.

13
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,405
The sumbitch
got shit for brains.

14
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,921
You seen Coulter?

15
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,081
Nope.

16
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,371
Listen up!

17
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,045
When them plews is cleaned,

18
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,248
I want you to hoop 'em up
real tight.

19
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,559
Remember, we're not doing
no 15-pelt bales!

20
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,560
We're going
30-pelt bales!

21
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,601
Fitzgerald!

22
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,641
Cap'n.

23
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,644
Where are we with the haul?
What are you thinking?

24
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,844
I'm thinking, whatever it is
they're hunting out there...

25
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,843
...I hope it don't need
another shot.

26
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,088
Make sure we're ready
to head out by dawn.

27
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,207
Been done by this morning.

28
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,725
I'd have liked
to be out by how,

29
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,888
but the men
are too tired.

30
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,360
We're only a few days
from the fort.

31
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,447
We're trapped out.

32
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,922
All we have to worry about
is fresh meat for the boys.

33
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,846
Well, you, uh, seen Coulter?

34
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,644
Hey, we took down
an elk. A big one.

35
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,449
We need help
to haul the meat back.

36
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,045
Let me know
when it's on the spit.

37
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,406
I'll help you
with it then.

38
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,244
Come on, I need your help.

39
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,641
We needed help when we were
loading them bales.

40
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,645
I been eating this damn
beaver meat so long...

41
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,928
...I'm starting to
miss my wife's cooking.

42
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,691
I'm starting
to miss your wife.

43
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,807
Shut up.

44
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,321
Help!

45
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,491
Help.

46
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,331
Is that Coulter?

47
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,802
You go get the Captain.

48
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,291
Jesus Christ.

49
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,169
Anybody see them?

50
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,811
Stay quiet.

51
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,166
Watch the ridge.

52
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,208
What was that?

53
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,120
Pa?

54
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,600
Let's go.

55
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,724
They got Thomas.

56
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,565
I can't see 'em.
I can't see 'em.

57
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,085
Get down!

58
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,086
We're surrounded!
They're everywhere!

59
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,089
Stay here! Stay here!

60
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,605
Paul, no!

61
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,402
They want us out in the open.

62
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,760
Nobody move!
Stay where you are!

63
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,809
They want the pelts.

64
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,564
We got to get
on that boat right now

65
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,130
or we'll lose it all.

66
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,282
Get to the boat!
To the boat, son! Move!

67
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,251
Move, move!

68
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:28,126
Leave the furs!
Leave the furs! To the boat!

69
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,442
Hawk!

70
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,965
Hawk!

71
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,970
Hawk!

72
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,522
Grab some pelts!
Come on, grab the pelts!

73
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,566
Grab the pelts!
Grab the pelts!

74
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,409
Give this
to my little girl.

75
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,762
You're coming with us.
I'll get help.

76
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,605
Leave the furs!
Leave the pelts!

77
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,566
Willman!

78
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,840
Lean on me.
Just keep going.

79
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,602
Get to the boat!

80
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,085
Fucking savage!

81
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,641
Get on the fucking boat!

82
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,611
Help!

83
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,007
Cut the rope!
Cut the rope!

84
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,810
Wait for Amos!

85
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,490
No! We go now!

86
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,649
Fire the cannon!

87
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,526
Don't leave! Wait!

88
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,761
My daughter, Powaqa, is not here.

89
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,449
Collect all the pelts we can carry.

90
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:50,169
We'll trade pelts with the French
for horses and keep searching for her.

91
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,889
...and dust becomes flour...

92
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,204
...and when the morning
is clear...

93
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,570
...this child of God will meet
Jesus Christ himself. Amen.

94
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,761
You ready?

95
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,091
Hold still.

96
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,930
Where did you learn that?

97
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,121
My father was a doctor.
Bridger!

98
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,680
Captain,
we got a swarm of

99
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,604
tree niggers out here
waiting to finish the job.

100
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,406
Tell me you got
some kind of plan.

101
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,601
Glass?

102
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,802
Missouri's no good.

103
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,601
Not while the Ree's
running it.

104
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,610
We got to
get off this boat.

105
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,802
Oh, you want to
get off the boat?

106
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,129
Then what do we do, huh?

107
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,767
Take our furs and sit
out there amongst the Ree

108
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,490
like a bunch of ducks?

109
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,963
Only safe thing to do is track
a new course back up on land.

110
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,491
That'll add weeks
to the trip.

111
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,682
Better than floating
where they can get eyes on us.

112
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,327
They got eyes on you
right now, son.

113
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,484
What I'm saying is
we stay on the boat.

114
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,007
Chart a course
toward the fort

115
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,485
and take our chances
on the water.

116
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,530
Glass knows
this territory best.

117
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,170
It's his job
to get us home safe.

118
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,401
Get us home safe?
Yeah.

119
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,926
Need I remind you
we already lost 32 men?

120
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,207
It's 33 now.
They were my men, Fitzgerald.

121
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,123
I know how many I lost.

122
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,651
We do like Glass says.
That's the end of it.

123
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,571
We have to
set the boat loose.

124
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,166
If the Ree are tracking us,
they'll find it downriver.

125
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,323
Best course is to
hike inland to the Grand

126
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,084
and follow it
to Fort Kiowa.

127
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,049
On foot?

128
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,326
It'll be winter
before we get there.

129
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,050
Yeah, unless
we come across a post,

130
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,246
trade for some horses.

131
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,163
Ain't no posts
that far over!

132
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,563
Captain, losing this boat
is a goddamn mistake.

133
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,002
The Ree
ain't that stupid.

134
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,600
We keep it, we can lay it up
around Arrow's Peak.

135
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,762
Quit acting like you know
what you're talking about.

136
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,330
Ain't nobody talking to you.

137
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,011
Who'd listen
to you anyway?

138
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,442
Can't find your way out of
your breeches to take a shit.

139
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,842
All I'm saying is
Camp Rhulen is just up the way.

140
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,924
We can hole up there.

141
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,850
We walk.

142
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,522
Yeah, I'm sure we will.

143
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,324
Wish my dad
was a doctor.

144
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,846
Then he could've bought me
a captain's job.

145
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,291
What do we do, eh?

146
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,523
Pray these pelts ain't rotten
if we ever get back here?

147
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,291
Make sure
to mark this place.

148
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,886
We're leaving a fortune
under these rocks.

149
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,451
Glass, chart a course.

150
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,966
Tightest you can that
gets us around the Ree.

151
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,370
This ain't right.

152
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,404
We all know these furs

153
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,482
ain't gonna be here
by the time we come back.

154
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,121
There's no way we can haul
them all the way to the fort.

155
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,123
Arikara are
all through the territory.

156
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,480
We'll want
our hands free.

157
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,483
We're gonna
lose those pelts.

158
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,085
You rather keep the pelts
or your life?

159
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,406
Life?

160
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,405
What life you talking about?
I ain't got no life.

161
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,449
I just got living
and the only way I get that

162
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,329
is through these pelts.

163
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,006
Fuck!

164
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,323
Ain't no way I'm going home
after six months

165
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,243
working my ass off
like a mule...

166
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,002
...risking my neck,
men dying, and for what?

167
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,605
Damn near lost everything.

168
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,921
Job's been fucked
from the start!

169
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,922
There's the one
been fucking us.

170
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,603
You wonder how the Ree
got the dead drop on us...

171
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,000
...when Mr. Glass
was supposed

172
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,963
to look out
for that very thing?

173
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,362
All them Pawnee buddies of his.

174
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,284
Pawnee's as much against
the Ree as the rest of us.

175
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,441
Yeah?

176
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,606
Well, what about
his little half-breed son?

177
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,441
What kind of savage
you think his mama was?

178
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,363
Oh, lay off the boy, Fitz.

179
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,804
All I'm saying is...

180
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,805
...a savage... is savage.

181
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,210
Hey, Glass...

182
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,720
...is it true
what they say

183
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,211
about you shooting a lieutenant

184
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,487
while living
with them savages?

185
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,044
Twenty-one dead soldiers
and 40 dead feathernecks.

186
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,327
But you and your boy
the only ones to walk out alive.

187
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,522
Kind of a miracle.

188
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,965
Shut up, Fitzgerald.

189
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,166
Is that what you did?

190
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,641
Shot one of your own
to save this little dog here?

191
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,286
Shut up!

192
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,723
Why? Was he playing with
this little boy's mama, huh?

193
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,490
Did he kill her?

194
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,571
Hey, you can quit
polishing that rifle

195
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,165
when I'm talking to you.

196
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,925
I'm working on it.

197
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,480
You can work on it
when I'm done talking to you.

198
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,921
Look at me.

199
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,331
That's enough!

200
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,761
You're forgetting
your place, boy.

201
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,082
As far as I can tell,
my place is here

202
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,447
on the smart end
of this rifle.

203
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,682
You move along, Fitzgerald.

204
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,771
That's an order!

205
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,887
Listen!

206
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,769
There's only a couple hours
of light left.

207
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,047
We got to stash these pelts
and get rid of the boat.

208
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,360
Let's go!

209
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,999
I told you to be invisible, son.

210
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,319
At least he...

211
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,319
...If you want to survive,
keep your mouth shut.

212
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,559
- At least he heard me...
- They don't hear your voice!

213
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,039
They just see the color of your face.

214
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,719
You understand?

215
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,846
Yes.

216
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,079
You have to listen to me, son.

217
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,447
You have to listen.

218
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,005
Beckett!

219
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,161
Weston!

220
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,243
Why are
they not jumping?

221
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,241
It looks
like they changed their minds.

222
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,242
Smart sumbitches.

223
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,251
Smart.

224
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,921
I ought to be
on that boat.

225
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,442
They did the right thing.

226
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,770
It's time to move.

227
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,965
Get up.

228
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,126
We're headed out.

229
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,564
I'm coming.

230
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,442
It's better you lay down.

231
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:19,519
When the rest of the men are ready
you send them to me.

232
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,488
I'm going west.

233
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:41,802
You are my son.

234
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,085
There are only two here.

235
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,164
Powaqa is not here.

236
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,039
The others probably took her.

237
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,883
They went north.

238
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:08,366
We'll pick up their tracks on the mountain.

239
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,050
Was it
the right decision?

240
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,491
Leaving the boat?

241
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,007
The Ree own that river.
They would've flanked us.

242
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,041
We stay east of the Grand
through the mountains,

243
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,770
we cut a week off our trip.

244
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,889
Lands are bone dry up there.
Nothing for the Ree to hunt.

245
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,325
Except us.

246
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,205
Except us.

247
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,002
Is it true
what Fitzgerald said?

248
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,205
Is that why you came out
here to the edge of the world?

249
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,161
Glass?

250
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,083
I do like the quiet.

251
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,531
Your boy...

252
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,524
...he's seen a lot.

253
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,044
He got a mother
you need to get him back to?

254
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,768
Mr. Glass!

255
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,924
There are cubs here!

256
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,170
We got cubs here!

257
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,804
Christ Almighty.

258
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,645
He's down here!

259
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,489
Keep your eyes open.
There's bears around.

260
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,529
I need your help now!

261
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,285
Oh, my God.

262
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,249
Get me rags now!

263
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,005
Give me rags
before he bleeds out. Rags.

264
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,844
Prepare the kit. Bridger!
You hold that.

265
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,284
Easy. Oh, my God.

266
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,646
Got to give him
credit for taking that grizz

267
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,960
down with him.

268
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,280
He shouldn't have shot.

269
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,362
The place is crawling
with tree niggers.

270
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,801
That's enough!
That's enough!

271
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,803
We're still
in Ree territory.

272
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,644
He's one of our own men.

273
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,807
Scout a circle around us.
North and west.

274
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,609
Take those two with you.

275
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,489
Bill, Fryman,
you take south and east.

276
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:13,086
Watch for anyone
that might've heard that shot.

277
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,249
We have to stitch him up.

278
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,324
What about me? Captain?

279
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,890
You just stay here.

280
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,321
Hold it down.

281
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,767
I'm so sorry, Mr. Glass.

282
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,486
Bridger,
press down here.

283
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,084
He's bleeding
down here, too.

284
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,807
They're torturing the bastard.

285
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,723
The proper thing to do
would be...

286
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,929
...to finish him off quick.

287
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,931
Unless he has a chance
of pulling through.

288
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,564
Pulling through?

289
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,882
You saw what that
grizz did to him.

290
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,048
He'll be dead inside an hour.
Mmm-hmm.

291
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,927
Yeah, we all will be
if he don't quit wailing like that.

292
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:58,002
Toward you and twist it
into place. I'll hold him. Go.

293
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,844
- Pa.
- Hold him. Go.

294
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,127
Go!

295
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,686
Now!

296
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,410
He passed out.

297
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,925
I'll take advantage
and stitch up his neck.

298
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,127
Water.

299
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,961
Bridger, tell the others

300
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,286
we'll camp here tonight.

301
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,727
I'm right here.

302
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,883
I'll be right here...

303
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,924
Toussaint, he's here.

304
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,046
I thought he wouldn't make it.

305
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,764
I'm glad you made it here.

306
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,130
We need horses and rifles.

307
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,842
We bring you many pelts.

308
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:06,483
No horses... just what we agreed.

309
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,527
Take all the pelts you want.

310
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,810
We need horses and rifles.

311
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,124
I need a woman with big tits...

312
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,884
Who can cook.

313
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,841
We can't give you any horses.

314
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,041
What's he saying?

315
00:32:23,042 --> 00:32:24,882
I don't know, something about horses.

316
00:32:24,883 --> 00:32:27,008
Bring us something to drink... some whisky.

317
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,681
Tell him to stop asking about the horses.

318
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,525
Always good doing business with you.

319
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,365
Horses.

320
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,041
No horses.

321
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,929
All we can trade are guns and ammunition.

322
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:45,441
Tell him if he asks about horses again,
there is no deal.

323
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,243
Where did you get these? The Americans?

324
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,405
They're already branded.

325
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:55,726
I'll only be able to get
half price for them.

326
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,768
Get him away from there.

327
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,370
I said no horses.

328
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,128
We'll take these three horses.

329
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,970
I'm not going to say it again.

330
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,682
They aren't part of the deal.

331
00:33:06,683 --> 00:33:08,364
Now tell your man to step away.

332
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,290
We had an agreement, you have to honor it.

333
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:17,091
<i>In French</i>
You stand there and talk to me about honor?

334
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:20,404
I told you he speaks French.

335
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,002
Those pelts are stolen.

336
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:31,761
You all have stolen everything from us.

337
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,650
Everything!

338
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,365
The land.

339
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,808
The animals.

340
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:45,406
Two white men snuck into our village,
and took my daughter, Powaqa.

341
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:54,766
We leave you these pelts
because honor demands it.

342
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,999
I take your horses to find my daughter.

343
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,800
You are free to try and stop me.

344
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,002
Business is business.

345
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:14,962
Prepare five horses for them.

346
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:23,724
I want everybody up
at the crack of dawn.

347
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,562
Carrying Glass will be hard...

348
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,724
...so we need to get ahead
as far as possible.

349
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,563
We'll divide into two groups.

350
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,651
Fitzgerald, Jones, Fryman,

351
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,087
you take the east side
of the river.

352
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,561
Anderson, you scout up front.

353
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:43,001
That claw
don't belong to you.

354
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,170
It ain't for me.

355
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,565
Stop!

356
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:05,247
Don't let him down!
Don't let him down!

357
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,131
Watch it.

358
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,926
How we gonna
make it up this?

359
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,126
Slow down.

360
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,811
It's killing us, Captain!

361
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,603
Lift it, Bridger!

362
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,363
Goddamn it,
keep it steady.

363
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,487
Lift it up higher.

364
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,607
I am.

365
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,965
And heave!

366
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,362
I'll go up and pull.

367
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,769
My foot!

368
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,524
Enough of this shit!

369
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,291
We'll never make it across
like this, Captain.

370
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,324
He's burning up.

371
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,329
Cap'n, you ain't doing us
nor him no favors...

372
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,846
...by letting him
go on suffering like this.

373
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,165
Captain, it's all
the same up here.

374
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:14,722
We're gonna have to go back.
Find another way.

375
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,401
Glass. Hugh.

376
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,927
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

377
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,921
Lay that rag over his eyes,
Mr. Bridger.

378
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,201
What?

379
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,486
Lay the rag
over his eyes.

380
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,686
Wait!

381
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,921
I'm sorry, Hugh.

382
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,764
Sir, I can't do that.

383
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,280
How do we
get back without him?

384
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,964
Only he knows the way.

385
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,041
Lay the rag
over his eyes.

386
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,167
I can't.

387
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,770
Wait! How do
we get back...

388
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,603
Lay it over his eyes!

389
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,610
Step back.

390
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:57,366
Bridger, stop!
Bridger, Henry.

391
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,283
Henry! Henry, please.

392
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,285
Captain. Captain.
Please. Please leave...

393
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,965
There's a $70 bonus

394
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,884
from the Rocky Mountain Fur
Company to the two men...

395
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,201
...that stay with Glass
to see this through.

396
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,406
I'll stay!

397
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,642
Me, too.
Money or not, I'll stay.

398
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,325
I'll need a third.

399
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,801
Sorry, Captain.

400
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,168
I have a family.
I'm not crazy.

401
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,724
Captain, three men
can't hold off a party of Ree,

402
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,643
much less some boys.

403
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,083
Besides, $70 ain't gonna buy
nobody a new set of ears.

404
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,730
A hundred, then.

405
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,561
This man is the only reason
we're still alive.

406
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,927
We were 45 men
when this started.

407
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,082
Now we're ten. Almost nine.

408
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,323
He's my father.
He can have my share.

409
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,926
Mine, too.
He can have my share also.

410
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,920
All right.

411
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,204
If Mr. Bridger
feels the same way,

412
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,611
I'll lag behind with them.

413
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,920
You?
Yep.

414
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,002
You already lost
my share of the pelts...

415
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,889
...so I got no choice
but to make it up

416
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,530
by some other means.

417
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,490
Sticking around
for another day or two

418
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,130
don't make no difference.

419
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,680
$300... at least I get to
go home with something.

420
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,684
Glass is to be cared
for until, understood?

421
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,691
Yeah. You have my word.
I understand.

422
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,691
You boys get him
down off this slope

423
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,683
and somewhere safe
before dark.

424
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,371
Fitzgerald.

425
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:33,366
Glass is to be cared for
as long as necessary.

426
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,643
And a proper burial
when it's time.

427
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,881
He's earned it.

428
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,131
I understand.

429
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,890
You hurt yourself?

430
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,051
I'll be fine.

431
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,971
Can you hear that wind, father?

432
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:05,284
Remember what mother used to say
about the wind?

433
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:11,805
The wind cannot defeat
a tree with strong roots.

434
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:21,684
You are still breathing...

435
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:28,729
I miss her so much.

436
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,931
I will be right here...

437
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,488
I'm right here.

438
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:04,920
As long as you can still grab a breath,
you fight.

439
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,800
<i>You breathe. Keep breathing.</i>

440
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:13,842
<i>When there is a storm...</i>

441
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:20,481
<i>And you stand in front of a tree...</i>

442
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:32,529
<i>If you look at its branches,
you swear it will fall.</i>

443
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:50,240
<i>But if you watch the trunk,
you will see its stability.</i>

444
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,725
<i>Three hundred bucks</i>

445
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,404
<i>goes a long way
toward retirement.</i>

446
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:38,291
<i>Go down to Texas, find me
a decent piece of land,</i>

447
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,249
<i>and start pissing in the wind.</i>

448
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:44,403
Get me the hell out of this
godforsaken place.

449
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,404
Ree done that to you?

450
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,651
I'm just asking.

451
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,324
Yeah, they done it.

452
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:59,491
They took their
sweet time with it.

453
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,960
At the start,
I didn't feel nothing.

454
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,764
I just heard the sound...

455
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:07,243
...of the knife scraping
against my skull and...

456
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:08,965
...them all laughing
and whooping

457
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,088
and hollering and whatnot.

458
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,930
Then the blood came.

459
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:16,005
It was cold. It started
streaming down my face,

460
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,605
in my eyes, and...

461
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,604
...breathing it in.

462
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,764
Choking on it.

463
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,922
That's when I felt it.

464
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,602
Yeah, felt all of it.

465
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,760
I got my head
turned inside out.

466
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:32,886
Jesus.

467
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,962
Them Indians
down Texas way...

468
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,124
...they may rob you,
but they ain't gonna take your topknot.

469
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:40,885
When was it?

470
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:45,610
Goddamn it,

471
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:48,968
will you quit that noise now,
will you?

472
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,486
Quit it.

473
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,604
<i>I'm falling further back</i>

474
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:20,251
<i>from Henry and the boys
on account of tending to you.</i>

475
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:25,920
Got to get up
the damn mountain,

476
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,321
but winter
keeps chasing us down.

477
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:34,528
If you ready
to take the sacrament...

478
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,682
...I can do that for you.

479
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:44,922
What you holding to, Glass?

480
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:49,681
You know...

481
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,283
...it would be better...

482
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:55,569
...if you were to take that
last breath of yours now...

483
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:57,130
for all of us.

484
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,523
Now you hung tough.

485
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:03,450
And that's something.

486
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:05,885
I'm begging you.

487
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:08,167
Them Ree are so close
I can smell 'em.

488
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,561
You can smell 'em, too.

489
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,041
You got to think of your boy.
All right?

490
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,724
'Cause you're gonna kill him.

491
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,122
You'll kill us all.

492
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:26,327
I can muzzle you
if you like.

493
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,323
Take away this suffering
quick and easy.

494
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,404
No one ever has to know
that you give up.

495
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,643
All you have to do is blink
if you want me to do that.

496
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,161
Save your boy and blink.

497
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,241
You just have to blink.

498
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:03,607
Yeah. There it is.

499
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:05,525
You'd best hope
the good Lord'll

500
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,602
get His ass here
quick, huh?

501
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,841
Maybe He'll forgive your sins,
maybe not.

502
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,048
Thus I do commend thee
to the Lord.

503
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:21,969
Through Jesus Christ the Lord
of all reality and mercy...

504
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:25,728
...and the Father
and the Creator, I hold thee...

505
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:28,041
Get away! Get away!

506
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:31,647
You okay?
Jim! Jim! Help!

507
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:43,807
Help!

508
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:45,211
Calm down.

509
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:47,129
Jim! Help!

510
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:49,891
Don't shout! You're gonna
get us all killed!

511
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:52,361
Keep away! I'll tell
the Captain what you did.

512
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:53,965
They'll hang you!

513
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:56,481
They'll hang you! Jim, help!

514
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,642
We have an understanding.

515
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,402
What's fucking wrong
with you people?

516
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,331
Shit.

517
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:19,242
I got one beaver, Hawk.

518
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:22,730
Breathing changed?

519
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,243
I hadn't noticed.

520
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:29,403
Damn, he's cold as ice.

521
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:33,082
Here you go, Mr. Glass.

522
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,925
This will help you.
Keep you warm.

523
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:38,251
It's all right.

524
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,605
Where's Hawk?

525
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,524
He ain't with you?

526
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:46,841
No.

527
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:48,251
No?

528
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,362
I understand, Mr. Glass.

529
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:58,444
It's all right.
I think I'll get a fire going.

530
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:01,286
Yeah.
Sounds like a good idea.

531
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:08,771
Hawk!

532
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:13,451
<i>Hawk!</i>

533
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:36,730
Shh. Ree.

534
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:39,724
There's about 20 of them
down by the creek.

535
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:43,646
They're headed this way.
Grab your shit and let's go.

536
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,926
Shit. What do we do?

537
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,729
Run, right now.

538
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:51,001
What about Hawk?

539
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:53,003
He ain't our problem no more.

540
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:54,491
We can't just leave him.

541
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,244
Either he's gutted or scalped.

542
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:58,766
And if he ain't
he can find us, can't he?

543
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:00,683
What about Glass?

544
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:03,127
He ain't our problem.
Like us, he's on his own.

545
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,806
We made a promise
to the Captain.

546
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:07,530
A proper burial
when the time was needed.

547
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:09,523
He needs that rifle!

548
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:13,924
He couldn't do nothing with it
if you tarred it to his hand.

549
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,764
We can't do this.

550
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:17,524
We got no fucking choice.

551
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,523
No, we can't.
Look at him.

552
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:24,047
All right, shit, then, buddy.
Get him up.

553
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:25,451
You want to take him?

554
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:29,690
Come on now!

555
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:32,804
Easy. Slowly, Fitz.
Easy with him.

556
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,850
Just get your shit.

557
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:38,365
Get your shit!

558
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,531
Shut up.

559
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:45,805
Shut up!

560
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:47,566
Hold up!

561
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,562
Fitz. What are you doing?

562
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,369
What does it look like?

563
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:56,727
Proper burial.
Like you wanted.

564
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,643
No, not like this.

565
00:50:58,720 --> 00:50:59,881
Why not?

566
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:03,411
He's alive, Fitz.
He's alive.

567
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:06,891
So shoot him.

568
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:21,842
I have to go.
I have to go.

569
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:25,241
I'm sorry, Mr. Glass.
I'm sorry.

570
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

571
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:44,602
Captain! This way!

572
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:48,126
There's a path down here!

573
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,603
There ain't shit down there!

574
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:53,125
We got to climb over!

575
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,645
Glass said to stay east!

576
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,121
Glass can go to hell!

577
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:59,371
What's the map say?

578
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,807
Keep climbing.
We climb, Captain.

579
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:03,530
We keep climbing.

580
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:05,449
Till we reach Old Gabe.

581
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:10,971
We climb.

582
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:13,805
We got to wait for Murph.

583
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:15,804
Yeah.
You wait for him.

584
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:17,971
Captain?

585
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,246
Sir...

586
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:24,687
...Murphy says
there's a way down there.

587
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:26,250
Who we following?

588
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:27,810
You follow who you want!

589
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:29,405
I'm going up!

590
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,005
Stubby, keep going up!

591
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:34,321
Murph! Come here!

592
00:55:56,360 --> 00:56:00,410
I'm not leaving you, son.

593
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:04,966
I'm right here.

594
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:12,445
Fire's done.

595
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:15,442
I can't even feel my feet.

596
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:20,524
Didn't we put enough distance
between us and them Ree?

597
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:23,649
A dozen Ree can make
twice as good time as we can.

598
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:25,484
Twenty.
What?

599
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:29,284
You said you saw
twenty Ree.

600
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:31,601
Yeah? What you
talking about?

601
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,370
You woke me up.
Mmm-hmm.

602
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:39,881
You said you saw
twenty Ree by the creek.

603
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:41,962
Well, yeah,
twenty, a dozen...

604
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:43,121
...it don't matter.

605
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:46,807
I wasn't gonna hang around
counting fucking feathers.

606
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,211
As a matter of fact...

607
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:55,725
...what was you doing down
by the creek all by yourself?

608
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:58,767
I'd already brought up
plenty of water.

609
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:01,726
Hey!

610
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:05,246
Answer me, Fitzgerald.
I asked you a question.

611
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:09,530
Don't question me
on account of you feel guilty.

612
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:11,887
Answer me
or I'll blow your head off.

613
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:14,122
You got
a short-term memory, boy.

614
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:16,921
Your ass would be floating
around the Missouri right now

615
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,650
if it wasn't for me.

616
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:22,642
You want to ask questions?

617
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:25,081
What you want to ask?
If you want to know, ask it.

618
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:26,566
Hmm?

619
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:27,971
You want to know
why you left

620
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:30,208
Mr. Glass back there
for dead, huh?

621
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:33,568
Or why you left your little
boyfriend running around?

622
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:36,484
You want to know
if he's still alive?

623
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:39,002
I'll tell you why.
It's 'cause you ain't a man yet.

624
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:41,328
It's 'cause you was
scared shitless.

625
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:42,845
You're scared now.

626
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:44,285
The Ree.

627
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:45,691
What of them?

628
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:48,443
Tell me, did you see 'em?

629
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:50,682
Put your rifle down.
Did you see the Ree?

630
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:54,120
No.

631
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:57,203
Not a single one.

632
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:03,361
You fucking lied to me?
You lied to me!

633
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:09,726
I had to scare
some sense into you, boy.

634
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:12,202
Glass was dead.
Hawk we don't know about.

635
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:15,211
No point in either of us
dying either, you understand?

636
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:17,688
The way I see it,
I saved your life twice now.

637
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,888
I ought to be God to you.

638
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:23,723
And God giveth...
and God taketh away.

639
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:32,525
Lucky fucker.

640
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:37,208
Next time you want to
shoot somebody...

641
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:39,123
...you might
want to use powder,

642
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,770
prime your rifle.

643
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:47,401
Come on. Let's git.
Grab your shit.

644
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:52,690
Fresh blood. This could be Powaqa.

645
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:05,726
A dead boy.

646
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:16,449
A Pawnee boy.

647
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:18,205
Let's go.

648
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:28,485
Who did this?

649
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:30,562
I don't know.

650
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:40,803
Could be
Captain Leavenworth's boys.

651
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:43,489
Mmm. Yeah.

652
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:47,246
Put some eyes on the back
of your head.

653
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:53,642
These Injuns ain't never
as dead as you think they are.

654
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:55,561
Look at 'em, huh?

655
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:58,086
They're always
stealing our shit.

656
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:36,522
We got horses over here!

657
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:42,210
Hey, Bridger.

658
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:49,290
We got horses!

659
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:57,122
What you want to do
about these pigs?

660
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:06,406
The Lord's on our side, kid.

661
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:16,324
You all right there, kid?

662
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:18,563
Your head in the right place?

663
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:20,571
I guess.

664
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:28,331
I can't help thinking about
whether we did the right...

665
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:30,921
Ain't our place to wonder.
The good Lord...

666
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:34,243
...got us on a road
whether we choose it or not.

667
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:40,763
My pop, he weren't
a religious man, you know?

668
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:43,002
If you couldn't grow it,
kill it, or eat it,

669
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:46,004
he just plain old
didn't believe in it.

670
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:50,208
And this one time he head on
up the old Saba hills.

671
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:51,845
San Saba hills?

672
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:56,206
He joined a couple Texas
Ranger buddies of his to hunt.

673
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:59,683
Pretty routine. He done it
like a hundred times before.

674
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:02,770
Should have been a 3-day kill,
but on the second day,

675
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:04,729
it all went fucked.

676
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:07,441
Somehow that night
he lost his buddies.

677
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:09,210
And to top it off...

678
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:12,040
...them Comanches
went and took the horses.

679
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:15,280
So he was starving
and delirious...

680
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:19,201
...and he crawls up
into this mott, this...

681
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:21,801
...group of trees out
in the middle of nowhere

682
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:24,486
just sticking up
in this ocean of scrub...

683
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:26,882
...and he found religion.

684
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:30,565
At that moment,
he told me...

685
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:32,723
...he found God.

686
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:35,926
Uh-huh.

687
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:42,768
And it turns out that God...

688
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:45,490
...He's a squirrel.

689
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:49,245
Yeah. A big, old meaty one.

690
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:54,446
"I found God,"
he used to say.

691
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:58,524
"And while sitting there
and basking in the glory

692
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:00,523
"and sublimity of mercy..."

693
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:04,685
shot and ate
that son of a bitch."

694
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:15,126
Mmm.

695
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:20,443
Yeah. You might want to
close your eyes, kid.

696
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:08,163
I'm injured.

697
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:10,889
What happened to you?

698
01:27:12,840 --> 01:27:14,649
A bear.

699
01:27:15,680 --> 01:27:17,489
A bear.

700
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:20,130
Grizzly.

701
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:24,845
Grizzly.

702
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:41,846
My men... left me for dead.

703
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:45,326
Killed my son.

704
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:53,366
I lost my family too.

705
01:27:53,720 --> 01:27:56,371
Sioux killed my people.

706
01:27:57,520 --> 01:28:04,483
I'm going south to find more Pawnee.

707
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:11,287
My heart bleeds...

708
01:28:12,760 --> 01:28:16,685
But revenge is in the creator's hands.

709
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:26,204
You will ride with me...

710
01:29:34,240 --> 01:29:36,083
Your body is rotten.

711
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:38,450
Need to heal.

712
01:29:43,960 --> 01:29:45,485
You could die.

713
01:30:00,160 --> 01:30:03,164
Yeah!
There she is.

714
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:06,011
We did it.

715
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,480
You ought to be
proud of yourself, boy.

716
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:11,447
Yeah.

717
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:12,760
We followed orders.

718
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:15,002
We just skipped
the funeral part.

719
01:30:15,320 --> 01:30:18,802
Don't go clown there
and start growing no conscience.

720
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:20,081
'Cause sure
as night'll come

721
01:30:20,160 --> 01:30:22,766
they'll have us swinging
from a couple ropes.

722
01:30:22,840 --> 01:30:25,525
We did
what we had to do.

723
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:55,521
<i>We had the extra day
so we managed to dig.</i>

724
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:57,365
...a little deeper,
lay rocks on top

725
01:30:57,440 --> 01:30:59,010
so scavengers
couldn't get at him.

726
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:02,369
It was done right and all.
He was buried right.

727
01:31:03,720 --> 01:31:04,960
Sir, can we...

728
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:06,246
The truth is that...

729
01:31:07,720 --> 01:31:10,724
...when Hawk disappeared,
I was worried about savages.

730
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:14,209
And I was ready to get,
to move on out.

731
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:18,406
Yeah, but, Bridger here
argued to stay.

732
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:21,368
He argued to stay...

733
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:24,444
...so he could at least
build a cross or something...

734
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:26,484
...to put on top
of Glass's grave,

735
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:29,564
and that's what he did.
That's what we did.

736
01:31:29,640 --> 01:31:32,120
I'm glad you pulled
your weight, Mr. Bridger.

737
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:33,850
He more than
pulled his weight, Captain.

738
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:36,321
This man here,
he was my partner.

739
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:46,371
Am I to assume that the agreed
arrangement did not change?

740
01:31:46,440 --> 01:31:49,330
Uh, fortunately for me,
it did not.

741
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:50,965
Mmm-hmm.

742
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:12,770
Thank you...

743
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:17,125
...for your courage,
honor, and service.

744
01:32:18,280 --> 01:32:19,725
Deal or no deal,
Mr. Bridger,

745
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:22,121
you deserve something
for what you did.

746
01:32:22,440 --> 01:32:23,805
Thank you.

747
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:37,687
Kid's been beating himself up
awful bad the whole trip.

748
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:43,202
We all saw
the shape Glass was in.

749
01:32:43,280 --> 01:32:45,806
There was no more
to be done. Right?

750
01:32:46,120 --> 01:32:47,167
Yeah.

751
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,161
We all saw him.

752
01:36:16,680 --> 01:36:22,323
<i>When there is a storm...</i>

753
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:29,084
<i>And you stand in front of a tree...</i>

754
01:36:30,240 --> 01:36:36,566
<i>If you look at its branches,
you swear it will fall.</i>

755
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:50,320
<i>But if you watch the trunk,
you will see its stability.</i>

756
01:42:11,880 --> 01:42:14,611
There are traces of a camp...

757
01:42:15,120 --> 01:42:18,169
There are traces of a camp...

758
01:42:19,400 --> 01:42:20,208
Where?

759
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:23,563
Entering the moon forest.

760
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:27,925
Maybe from two days ago.
They are moving east.

761
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:30,644
Tell the others.

762
01:42:31,320 --> 01:42:34,767
Let's move quickly,
Powaqa could be with them!

763
01:42:55,600 --> 01:42:57,762
Bring me the girl...

764
01:42:58,480 --> 01:43:00,881
Those five horses weren't for free.

765
01:44:21,680 --> 01:44:23,444
Shh...

766
01:44:24,880 --> 01:44:26,803
Don't make a sound.

767
01:44:41,080 --> 01:44:44,482
I will get a horse.

768
01:44:48,760 --> 01:44:52,162
I'll cut off your balls.

769
01:45:07,720 --> 01:45:10,530
Where is Toussaint?

770
01:45:12,920 --> 01:45:15,287
Come here...

771
01:46:06,520 --> 01:46:08,443
- May I join you?
- Yes.

772
01:46:08,680 --> 01:46:09,681
Yeah?

773
01:46:09,800 --> 01:46:10,801
Yes.

774
01:46:10,880 --> 01:46:14,726
I was wondering when we might
be getting paid for that haul.

775
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:17,485
'Cause them pelts
we collected

776
01:46:17,600 --> 01:46:19,284
are still out there,
you know...

777
01:46:19,360 --> 01:46:20,964
...under a couple foot
of dirt and snow.

778
01:46:21,040 --> 01:46:23,691
But that ain't
my fault.

779
01:46:23,760 --> 01:46:25,330
I'm waiting for
Captain Leavenworth

780
01:46:25,440 --> 01:46:27,124
to arrive
with his army.

781
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:29,487
Then we'll have
enough men...

782
01:46:29,560 --> 01:46:32,291
...to shoot some civilization
into those fucking Arikara

783
01:46:32,360 --> 01:46:34,044
and get back
our pelts.

784
01:46:34,120 --> 01:46:36,248
All right. All right.

785
01:46:36,880 --> 01:46:39,247
When's that supposed to happen?

786
01:46:39,560 --> 01:46:40,891
I don't know.

787
01:46:41,240 --> 01:46:43,402
But until then,
nobody gets paid.

788
01:46:45,720 --> 01:46:47,722
Listen here, all right?

789
01:46:48,080 --> 01:46:51,721
I was hired to trap 'em.
I wasn't hired to guard 'em.

790
01:46:52,080 --> 01:46:56,449
The way I see it,
now you, you got a safe.

791
01:46:56,600 --> 01:46:58,409
It's probably full of money.

792
01:46:58,480 --> 01:47:01,290
You signed a contract
to protect your boss

793
01:47:01,360 --> 01:47:03,601
and your boss's property.

794
01:47:04,240 --> 01:47:05,571
And that safe
isn't full anymore.

795
01:47:05,640 --> 01:47:07,927
It's short about $300.

796
01:47:08,600 --> 01:47:10,921
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

797
01:47:11,240 --> 01:47:13,163
It means,
according to my records...

798
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:15,169
...you purchased more goods
on the expedition

799
01:47:15,280 --> 01:47:17,601
than what you are
owed by the company.

800
01:47:22,440 --> 01:47:24,602
Now, Happy New Year,
Fitzgerald.

801
01:56:30,760 --> 01:56:33,889
Fryman!
White man at the gate!

802
01:56:46,440 --> 01:56:47,805
Speak English.

803
01:56:48,040 --> 01:56:50,168
I have no weapon.

804
01:56:50,240 --> 01:56:51,969
Open her up!

805
01:56:52,040 --> 01:56:53,485
Get the Captain!

806
01:56:53,560 --> 01:56:54,607
<i>Where are your men?</i>

807
01:56:55,800 --> 01:56:57,006
All dead.

808
01:56:57,080 --> 01:56:58,366
Who was he?

809
01:56:58,880 --> 01:57:01,486
I don't know.
Something to eat, please?

810
01:57:01,560 --> 01:57:03,130
Food comes at a price.

811
01:57:04,320 --> 01:57:05,651
I have no money.

812
01:57:05,720 --> 01:57:07,245
Then you don't eat.

813
01:57:07,320 --> 01:57:10,085
Give back some of them stolen
pelts you buy from the Injuns.

814
01:57:10,160 --> 01:57:11,650
Not now, Jones.
Huh?

815
01:57:11,720 --> 01:57:13,722
Silver.
How is this? Silver.

816
01:57:16,840 --> 01:57:18,251
This all you got?

817
01:57:20,320 --> 01:57:22,322
We was nine.

818
01:57:22,680 --> 01:57:25,160
My friend, he die
in the snow.

819
01:57:25,480 --> 01:57:27,482
And the other was...

820
01:57:27,840 --> 01:57:29,842
...kill by wolf. I see it.

821
01:57:30,160 --> 01:57:32,322
By wolf, yeah, kill.

822
01:57:32,680 --> 01:57:34,250
Where'd you get this?

823
01:57:34,840 --> 01:57:36,171
Canteen.

824
01:57:36,440 --> 01:57:39,171
He drop it.
He kill Toussaint, he drop it...

825
01:57:39,280 --> 01:57:40,486
Who? Who?

826
01:57:40,560 --> 01:57:42,688
I don't know.
I don't see.

827
01:57:44,600 --> 01:57:45,647
It could be Hawk.

828
01:57:48,520 --> 01:57:49,931
Yeah, could be.

829
01:57:50,040 --> 01:57:52,122
That half-breed runt
couldn't steal no horse.

830
01:57:52,200 --> 01:57:53,960
- Maybe it was Weston.
- Or Beckett.

831
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:55,365
How far from here?

832
01:57:55,440 --> 01:57:56,771
Thirty mile.

833
01:57:56,880 --> 01:57:58,484
Northwest,
near the Yellowstone.

834
01:57:58,560 --> 01:57:59,971
The Yellowstone!

835
01:58:00,040 --> 01:58:02,725
Get the horses saddled.
Torches and supplies.

836
01:58:02,800 --> 01:58:04,529
Ten dollars a man.

837
01:58:04,600 --> 01:58:06,204
Anderson, you stay here.

838
01:58:06,280 --> 01:58:09,170
Yes, sir.
Feed him and watch him.

839
01:58:10,440 --> 01:58:12,010
I'll get you a drink.

840
01:58:28,120 --> 01:58:29,201
When we get to
the Yellowstone,

841
01:58:29,320 --> 01:58:31,448
we split into two groups!

842
01:58:42,880 --> 01:58:44,211
Hawk!

843
01:58:44,440 --> 01:58:46,442
Hawk, you out there?

844
01:58:54,040 --> 01:58:56,202
Whoa! Whoa!

845
01:59:03,360 --> 01:59:05,124
Keep your guard up!

846
01:59:06,880 --> 01:59:08,405
Eyes in front!

847
01:59:20,040 --> 01:59:21,485
Who are you?

848
01:59:21,720 --> 01:59:23,563
Beckett? Is that you?

849
01:59:35,320 --> 01:59:36,526
Glass?

850
01:59:37,760 --> 01:59:38,807
Glass!

851
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:41,124
Jesus Christ!

852
01:59:41,200 --> 01:59:43,089
Jesus Christ,
what happened?

853
01:59:43,760 --> 01:59:45,364
Where is he?

854
01:59:48,200 --> 01:59:50,521
Jones, take him. Go.

855
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,844
I'm riding ahead.
Bill, take Bridger.

856
01:59:54,840 --> 01:59:56,365
Take Bridger!

857
02:00:10,520 --> 02:00:11,521
Have you seen Fitzgerald?

858
02:00:11,640 --> 02:00:12,971
No, sir.

859
02:00:18,800 --> 02:00:20,962
Get up. Get up!

860
02:00:21,040 --> 02:00:22,804
You seen Fitzgerald?
No, sir.

861
02:00:22,960 --> 02:00:24,041
Fitzgerald?

862
02:00:33,880 --> 02:00:36,690
Whoa, easy.
Where did he go?

863
02:00:37,880 --> 02:00:40,406
Who?
Fitzgerald. Where did he go?

864
02:00:40,720 --> 02:00:41,721
I have no idea.

865
02:00:41,800 --> 02:00:43,290
Tell me or I'll take
your head off.

866
02:00:43,360 --> 02:00:45,328
I swear to God...

867
02:00:45,400 --> 02:00:47,323
Tell me. Tell me!

868
02:00:47,400 --> 02:00:48,731
Texas!

869
02:00:48,800 --> 02:00:53,089
He said he was going to Texas.
He said he was gonna reenlist.

870
02:00:53,160 --> 02:00:54,605
Then he started
talking about property.

871
02:00:54,680 --> 02:00:56,603
"A decent
piece of land."

872
02:00:56,680 --> 02:00:59,206
He's heading for Texas.
That's all I know.

873
02:00:59,280 --> 02:01:00,645
Stay here.

874
02:01:03,760 --> 02:01:05,250
Fitzgerald!

875
02:01:06,600 --> 02:01:08,284
Fitzgerald!

876
02:01:36,800 --> 02:01:38,290
Goddamn it!

877
02:01:41,040 --> 02:01:42,644
Goddamn it!

878
02:01:43,280 --> 02:01:46,204
Jones! Get the Captain!

879
02:01:46,280 --> 02:01:47,486
Fryman!

880
02:01:47,560 --> 02:01:48,721
Open the gate!

881
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:50,325
Open it up!

882
02:01:52,080 --> 02:01:53,730
Murphy,
get the Captain.

883
02:02:00,160 --> 02:02:02,731
Get him to the doctor. Now!

884
02:02:03,920 --> 02:02:07,561
You said he was dead!
You said he was dead!

885
02:02:07,640 --> 02:02:08,721
I thought
he was, I swear!

886
02:02:10,640 --> 02:02:12,005
He lied to me!

887
02:02:12,080 --> 02:02:13,491
You're a liar.

888
02:02:13,560 --> 02:02:16,131
You left him out there!

889
02:02:17,160 --> 02:02:18,924
Say the Lord's Prayer.

890
02:02:19,240 --> 02:02:21,163
Say the Lord's Prayer!

891
02:02:22,520 --> 02:02:27,003
- Our Father, Who art in heaven.
- Who art... I can't!

892
02:02:27,080 --> 02:02:28,844
Shut up! Shut up!

893
02:02:28,920 --> 02:02:31,844
From here out,
you're a prisoner charged with treason!

894
02:02:31,920 --> 02:02:34,571
Take him to the cage!
Take him to the cage

895
02:02:34,640 --> 02:02:36,529
or you'll hang alongside him!

896
02:02:36,600 --> 02:02:38,762
I thought he was gonna die!

897
02:02:40,200 --> 02:02:41,929
Fitz lied to me!

898
02:02:43,040 --> 02:02:44,280
I couldn't help him!

899
02:02:48,200 --> 02:02:49,611
Glass!

900
02:02:49,680 --> 02:02:51,409
Fitz lied to me!

901
02:03:21,880 --> 02:03:22,881
How is he?

902
02:03:22,960 --> 02:03:24,405
He'll be fine,
but there is swelling.

903
02:03:24,480 --> 02:03:25,811
He needs to rest.

904
02:03:25,960 --> 02:03:28,008
I'll be back
to check up on him.

905
02:03:37,320 --> 02:03:39,561
He ran off,
didn't he?

906
02:03:48,160 --> 02:03:50,527
Bridger's telling the truth.

907
02:03:52,360 --> 02:03:53,691
How's that?

908
02:03:54,280 --> 02:03:58,001
Fitzgerald lied to him.
He was just following orders.

909
02:04:00,120 --> 02:04:02,885
He wasn't there when
Fitzgerald stabbed my boy to death.

910
02:04:07,960 --> 02:04:09,530
Is that what happened?

911
02:04:11,760 --> 02:04:13,285
He killed Hawk.

912
02:04:17,360 --> 02:04:18,964
I need a horse and gun.

913
02:04:19,040 --> 02:04:22,408
No, you need to rest and eat.
I'm going after him.

914
02:04:22,480 --> 02:04:23,766
No.

915
02:04:25,120 --> 02:04:26,804
You'll never find him
without me.

916
02:04:27,120 --> 02:04:29,805
If we wait till morning
he'll get away.

917
02:04:29,880 --> 02:04:31,484
No, he won't.

918
02:04:32,640 --> 02:04:34,483
He's afraid.

919
02:04:35,480 --> 02:04:38,484
He knows how far
I came for him.

920
02:04:39,720 --> 02:04:40,721
Same as that elk.

921
02:04:40,800 --> 02:04:44,247
When they get afraid,
they run deep into the woods.

922
02:04:44,800 --> 02:04:48,691
I got him trapped.
He just doesn't know it yet.

923
02:04:49,080 --> 02:04:50,923
How can you be so sure?

924
02:04:51,720 --> 02:04:54,564
'Cause he has
everything to lose.

925
02:04:56,640 --> 02:04:59,166
All I had was that boy.

926
02:05:00,320 --> 02:05:02,482
And he took him away from me.

927
02:05:05,920 --> 02:05:08,241
I can't let you
go back out there.

928
02:05:08,320 --> 02:05:09,924
Not again.

929
02:05:13,160 --> 02:05:15,845
I ain't afraid
to die anymore.

930
02:05:17,560 --> 02:05:19,449
I done it already.

931
02:05:25,200 --> 02:05:27,123
I'm going with you.

932
02:06:42,360 --> 02:06:44,328
That's his horse,
all right.

933
02:06:46,920 --> 02:06:49,730
No way he could've ridden him
through the night.

934
02:06:49,800 --> 02:06:51,529
How far ahead?

935
02:06:52,120 --> 02:06:54,122
Half a day at the most.

936
02:06:54,440 --> 02:06:56,204
Could be Ree.

937
02:06:56,320 --> 02:06:58,607
If they aren't his,
we lose him.

938
02:06:59,280 --> 02:07:02,966
Unless he reenlisted
so he could justify killing again...

939
02:07:03,280 --> 02:07:05,282
...these tracks
right here are his.

940
02:07:15,640 --> 02:07:18,120
<i>I can't remember
my wife's face.</i>

941
02:07:18,960 --> 02:07:21,486
<i>Last week,
she was still with me.</i>

942
02:07:23,040 --> 02:07:24,804
<i>Now she's gone.</i>

943
02:07:27,800 --> 02:07:31,168
I worry I won't recognize her
when I get back home.

944
02:07:43,320 --> 02:07:45,641
Is it true
you killed an officer?

945
02:07:50,320 --> 02:07:53,688
I just killed the man
who was trying to kill my son.

946
02:08:12,440 --> 02:08:13,771
Smoke.

947
02:08:15,040 --> 02:08:16,451
How close?

948
02:08:21,120 --> 02:08:23,361
No more than
a mile up that way.

949
02:08:23,520 --> 02:08:26,888
I'm gonna head up to the west.
You go down to the east.

950
02:08:27,200 --> 02:08:29,601
Let's see if we can
find some tracks.

951
02:08:30,480 --> 02:08:32,289
And if it's the Ree?

952
02:08:32,800 --> 02:08:35,201
If it's the Ree,
you turn right back around

953
02:08:35,280 --> 02:08:37,123
and meet me back here.

954
02:10:04,960 --> 02:10:07,804
Now, I wouldn't expect
to find a man of your stature...

955
02:10:08,120 --> 02:10:09,645
...so far away
from his stove

956
02:10:09,720 --> 02:10:11,404
on a morning
as cold as this, Captain.

957
02:10:11,480 --> 02:10:12,811
You lost?

958
02:10:12,960 --> 02:10:15,486
I'm here to take you back
to Fort Kiowa...

959
02:10:15,800 --> 02:10:17,962
...where you
will be tried for murder.

960
02:10:18,320 --> 02:10:19,651
Is that so?

961
02:10:19,880 --> 02:10:22,167
I ain't crazy
about your plan.

962
02:10:22,640 --> 02:10:24,642
Besides, I got
one of my own.

963
02:17:53,080 --> 02:17:55,845
We had a deal, Glass!

964
02:17:58,920 --> 02:18:01,400
I tried to tell your boy,
all right?

965
02:18:01,480 --> 02:18:04,450
I tried to tell him,
but he wouldn't listen

966
02:18:04,520 --> 02:18:06,204
and he kept on screaming.

967
02:18:06,280 --> 02:18:08,806
He was gonna get
everybody killed.

968
02:18:10,440 --> 02:18:13,410
But you and me...
we had a deal.

969
02:18:15,440 --> 02:18:17,727
You know what
happened out there.

970
02:18:18,120 --> 02:18:21,169
And on my soul,
the Lord... He knows...

971
02:18:21,240 --> 02:18:23,083
...what happened out there.

972
02:18:25,800 --> 02:18:27,564
There was no deal.

973
02:18:30,640 --> 02:18:32,369
You killed my boy.

974
02:18:36,160 --> 02:18:38,242
Well, maybe you should've
raised a man,

975
02:18:38,360 --> 02:18:40,089
instead of some
girlie little bitch.

976
02:18:51,920 --> 02:18:53,763
Goddamn it.

977
02:21:16,960 --> 02:21:20,806
You came all this way
just for your revenge, huh?

978
02:21:23,240 --> 02:21:25,561
Well, you enjoy it, Glass.

979
02:21:26,400 --> 02:21:29,370
'Cause there ain't nothing
gonna bring your boy back.

980
02:21:32,320 --> 02:21:34,004
