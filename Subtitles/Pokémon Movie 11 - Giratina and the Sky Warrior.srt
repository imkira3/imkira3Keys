That did feel nice...

I'll bet it did.

Although it was a little chilly.

been the tiniest bit gentler...

- Huh.

Did you...?

00:13:55,197 --> 00:13:56,239
Yeah, I heard it!

It's telepathy!

184
00:13:59,576 --> 00:14:01,786
Okay, so where did you come from?

185
00:14:02,037 --> 00:14:03,246
From over there.

186
00:14:03,288 --> 00:14:04,539
From over where?

187
00:14:04,581 --> 00:14:06,583
I said from over there.

188
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:08,960

mean by over there?

and then you head over there...

192
00:14:15,467 --> 00:14:16,634
Something's not right!

(Nurse Joy) It's a Shaymin,
the Gratitude Pokémon.

00:14:42,244 --> 00:14:44,037

Now, will you go out with me?

So grateful!

218
00:15:09,813 --> 00:15:12,273
Of course we could
always just be friends!

219
00:15:12,482 --> 00:15:13,816
Still more grateful!

220
00:15:13,901 --> 00:15:15,319
Of course, perhaps...

221
00:15:16,403 --> 00:15:18,947

At the Pokémon Center!

231
00:15:41,428 --> 00:15:44,180
Nurse Joy treated you,
and now you're all better!

Oh, please!

233
00:15:45,265 --> 00:15:46,849
I never need healing!

234
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:48,017
But I do get hungry...

235
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,353
That sure doesn't sound
like gratitude to me...

236
00:15:50,812 --> 00:15:52,396
Well, you sound fine now!

237
00:15:52,439 --> 00:15:53,982
I'm glad you're feeling healthy.

238
00:15:54,024 --> 00:15:55,233
My name is Dawn!

239
00:15:55,317 --> 00:15:57,360
And my partner Piplup is over here!

240
00:15:57,444 --> 00:15:59,529
- Pip!
- Pika!

241
00:16:00,155 --> 00:16:01,865
I've got just the thing.

242
00:16:02,074 --> 00:16:03,909
Try this, it's called a poffin.

243
00:16:03,992 --> 00:16:05,201
I made it myself.

244
00:16:05,535 --> 00:16:06,869
Oh, thank you!

245
00:16:10,123 --> 00:16:10,832
So?

246
00:16:10,832 --> 00:16:12,458
It's okay, I guess...

247
00:16:12,501 --> 00:16:13,668
Okay?

248
00:16:13,669 --> 00:16:15,587
Hey! I'm Ash!

249
00:16:15,629 --> 00:16:17,839
I want you to meet
my partner Pikachu!

250
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:18,840
Pikachu!

251
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,094
Pika!

252
00:16:23,303 --> 00:16:26,514
[coughing]

253
00:16:26,515 --> 00:16:29,226
Whoa, you're not
gonna blow up, are you?

254
00:16:29,226 --> 00:16:31,144
It breathed in smoke
from our stove...

255
00:16:31,269 --> 00:16:31,936
A-ha!

256
00:16:31,979 --> 00:16:33,897
That would be called Seed Flare.

257
00:16:33,897 --> 00:16:35,273
Wha-? Seed Flare?

258
00:16:35,691 --> 00:16:37,651
When a Shaymin
breathes in polluted air,

259
00:16:37,693 --> 00:16:39,403
it purifies it in its body,

260
00:16:39,403 --> 00:16:42,406
separating it into light and
water and then expelling it.

261
00:16:42,447 --> 00:16:44,323
That process is called Seed Flare!

262
00:16:44,366 --> 00:16:45,742
- Pika!
- Lup!

263
00:16:45,951 --> 00:16:48,703
Shaymin, you're really
something aren't you?

264
00:16:48,829 --> 00:16:50,288
I am aren't I?

265
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:51,289
(Nurse Joy)
One thing...

266
00:16:51,873 --> 00:16:54,041
There was a Shaymin
who used Seed Flare,

267
00:16:54,626 --> 00:16:58,421
and when it inhaled toxic air
it destroyed an entire forest!

268
00:16:59,172 --> 00:17:02,425
You're all lucky your stove
had very little toxicify.

269
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:05,970
I would say you owe
me a big thank you!

270
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:08,140
We're supposed to tell you that!

271
00:17:08,181 --> 00:17:09,974
And don't forget we're
the ones who brought you

272
00:17:10,017 --> 00:17:11,351
- to the Pokémon Center!
- Pika!

273
00:17:11,393 --> 00:17:13,603
- That was your idea!
- What?

274
00:17:13,854 --> 00:17:14,813
But wait...

275
00:17:15,897 --> 00:17:18,190
What in the world would
a Shaymin be doing here,

276
00:17:18,233 --> 00:17:19,317
of all places?

277
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,694
- I shouldn't be here should I?
- Piplup!

278
00:17:21,737 --> 00:17:22,946
So what happened?

279
00:17:22,946 --> 00:17:25,198
I was tossed all over the place!

280
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,407
It was horrible!

281
00:17:26,408 --> 00:17:28,618
That's how you got
covered by all that dirt!

282
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:29,535
I know!

283
00:17:29,578 --> 00:17:32,247
So you're going to bring me
to the Flower Garden right?

284
00:17:32,956 --> 00:17:35,541
Look here, I have to go to
the Flower Garden

285
00:17:35,584 --> 00:17:36,376
and that's that!

286
00:17:36,418 --> 00:17:38,044
For the Flower Bearing of course!

287
00:17:38,086 --> 00:17:40,254
- Flower Bearing?
- Never heard of that before...

288
00:17:40,964 --> 00:17:42,298
(Nurse Joy)
Shaymin have a custom.

289
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,759
Once every season a group
of them gather together

290
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,428
in a garden, and migrate,

291
00:17:46,428 --> 00:17:49,806
then a brand new garden grows
wherever they decide to stop.

292
00:17:50,807 --> 00:17:53,518
That's where the name
Flower Bearing comes from.

293
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,312
I'm going to fly off from
the Flower Garden!

294
00:17:56,354 --> 00:17:57,938
Wow... You can fly?

295
00:17:58,065 --> 00:17:59,691
Don't tell me you can't...

296
00:17:59,733 --> 00:18:00,900
Of course I can't!

297
00:18:00,942 --> 00:18:02,485
Aw, what a shame!

298
00:18:02,486 --> 00:18:03,737
Man...

299
00:18:03,779 --> 00:18:06,156
Come on...
Let's go to the Flower Garden!

300
00:18:06,198 --> 00:18:07,365
So where is it?

301
00:18:07,449 --> 00:18:09,409
It's right over there!

302
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:10,911
Let's go now!

303
00:18:10,952 --> 00:18:12,662
I thought you said you could fly

304
00:18:12,704 --> 00:18:14,330
I can but not now.

305
00:18:14,372 --> 00:18:15,664
What's that supposed to mean?

306
00:18:15,999 --> 00:18:17,375
No need to worry!

307
00:18:17,417 --> 00:18:19,961
You'll get to the Flower Garden
'cause we'll all take you!

308
00:18:19,961 --> 00:18:21,045
Piplup!

309
00:18:21,129 --> 00:18:22,130
Pika, Pika!

310
00:18:22,297 --> 00:18:23,423
(Brock)
Shall we get moving?

311
00:18:23,673 --> 00:18:25,174
(Ash)
Right... Let's do it!

312
00:18:25,342 --> 00:18:27,344
- Gratitude Pokémon...!
- Shaymin!

313
00:18:27,511 --> 00:18:29,513
Of course we're talking primo rare!

314
00:18:29,513 --> 00:18:31,973
Giving a gratitudinous gift
of Shaymin to the Boss

315
00:18:31,973 --> 00:18:34,183
would certainly gift
back to us in spades!

316
00:18:34,184 --> 00:18:36,269
Wealth beyond our wildest dreams!

317
00:18:36,478 --> 00:18:38,396
We'll be bursting
at the money seams!

318
00:18:38,438 --> 00:18:40,857
So, it's Operation Swipe Shaymin!

319
00:18:40,899 --> 00:18:41,733
- Right!
- Yeah!

320
00:18:41,775 --> 00:18:43,359
Wobbuff-

321
00:18:49,741 --> 00:18:52,201
(Ash)
Okay which way should we go?

322
00:18:52,327 --> 00:18:53,161
That way!

323
00:18:53,161 --> 00:18:54,203
No, this way!

324
00:18:54,204 --> 00:18:55,371
No, this way!

325
00:18:55,455 --> 00:18:56,706
Make up your mind!

326
00:18:57,124 --> 00:18:58,250
Now, Ash...

327
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,460
So, which way, Shaymin?

328
00:19:12,222 --> 00:19:13,389
Pika!

329
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:14,682
It's like a bouquet!

330
00:19:14,766 --> 00:19:16,017
It's that way!

331
00:19:16,017 --> 00:19:17,018
Lup?

332
00:19:17,185 --> 00:19:18,102
Piplup!

333
00:19:18,645 --> 00:19:21,022
Someone please tell me
which way that way is?

334
00:19:22,816 --> 00:19:24,818
Pip, Pip, Pip, Pip, Pip, Pip...

335
00:19:33,869 --> 00:19:34,578

But who's here?

340
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,751
Them! They are!

341
00:19:42,169 --> 00:19:42,878

Pika!

We put the "they" in them!

344
00:19:46,173 --> 00:19:48,425
And of course you
put the "T" in twerps!

345
00:19:48,633 --> 00:19:49,592

Kinda says it all, doesn't it?

What's going on?

359
00:20:26,171 --> 00:20:28,006

Is it gone?

There it is!

Piplup! Use Bubblebeam!

Pip, Pip, Pip!

375
00:21:15,804 --> 00:21:17,972
Stop it, all of you!

376
00:21:17,973 --> 00:21:19,849
You can't upset Giratina!

377
00:21:19,891 --> 00:21:21,058
Giratina?

378
00:21:21,309 --> 00:21:22,184
That's what that is?

379
00:21:22,227 --> 00:21:23,144
Shieldon!

380
00:21:28,984 --> 00:21:30,276
- Over here!
- Right...!

381
00:21:31,069 --> 00:21:32,153
- Piplup!
- Pika!

382
00:21:34,531 --> 00:21:35,448

Piplup, Piplup!

387
00:21:55,719 --> 00:21:56,803
Be careful!

388
00:21:57,721 --> 00:21:59,264
My body feels normal again!

389
00:21:59,306 --> 00:22:01,349
We made it through
the low-gravify zone!

390
00:22:02,517 --> 00:22:04,977
This is some weird place, for sure. <i>..</i>

391
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:07,605
Piplup, Pip, Piplup!

392
00:22:07,647 --> 00:22:08,439
Pika!

393
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:10,191
Pika, Pika!

394
00:22:11,609 --> 00:22:13,235
Pika...

395
00:22:21,619 --> 00:22:22,620
Is anybody hurt?

396
00:22:22,704 --> 00:22:25,081
Well, I managed to not get eaten!

397
00:22:25,206 --> 00:22:26,957
Are you the Shaymin from before?

398
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,875
Are you...

399
00:22:28,043 --> 00:22:29,044
Who are you?

400
00:22:29,044 --> 00:22:31,212
Newton Graceland is the name!

401
00:22:31,212 --> 00:22:34,006
I'm in the process of
researching the Reverse World.

402
00:22:34,382 --> 00:22:36,467
And just so you know,
among those in my field

403
00:22:36,509 --> 00:22:39,386
I'm considered a genius
if I do say so myself.

404
00:22:39,929 --> 00:22:42,097
Why doesn't he tell us
what he really thinks?

405
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,599
- Humble guy.
- Pika.

406
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,767
What a weirdo!

407
00:22:45,268 --> 00:22:46,352
Come on!

408
00:22:46,394 --> 00:22:49,480
That's no way to treat someone
who saved your lives.

409
00:22:50,482 --> 00:22:51,524
(Dawn)
I'm sorry.

410
00:22:51,566 --> 00:22:53,109
Thank you for saving us!

411
00:22:53,485 --> 00:22:54,611
My name's Ash!

412
00:22:54,736 --> 00:22:55,778
And I'm Dawn!

413
00:22:55,904 --> 00:22:57,280
- Pikachu!
- Piplup!

414
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,782
Uh, what exactly
is the Reverse World?

415
00:22:59,866 --> 00:23:01,075
And what's a Giratina?

416
00:23:01,076 --> 00:23:03,411
Ahh, excellent questions, those.

417
00:23:03,411 --> 00:23:04,870
Allow me to explain!

418
00:23:05,288 --> 00:23:07,415
We're now in the middle
of an alternate world

419
00:23:07,415 --> 00:23:09,458
the location of which
is exactly opposite

420
00:23:09,501 --> 00:23:10,919
the world of reality!

421
00:23:11,086 --> 00:23:13,463
- World of reality?
- Pika?

422
00:23:13,463 --> 00:23:16,424
The force of gravify gets
weaker and stronger here

423
00:23:16,424 --> 00:23:18,092
depending on where
you happen to be,

424
00:23:18,093 --> 00:23:21,304
which means here,
we have a distorted world!

425
00:23:26,935 --> 00:23:28,645
(Newton)
Even though these two worlds

426
00:23:28,645 --> 00:23:30,813
exist side by side with each other,

427
00:23:30,814 --> 00:23:32,774
they do not intersect at all.

428
00:23:32,941 --> 00:23:35,735
However, Giratina,
and only Giratina,

429
00:23:35,777 --> 00:23:38,571
has the power to travel
between these two worlds.

430
00:23:38,613 --> 00:23:40,948
Moreover, Giratina's
the only Pokémon

431
00:23:40,949 --> 00:23:42,492
that exists in this world,

432
00:23:42,826 --> 00:23:45,578
which is to say Giratina's
the master of the Reverse World,

433
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:46,454
as it were.

434
00:23:46,538 --> 00:23:48,706
Well, I don't like Giratina.

435
00:23:48,748 --> 00:23:50,750
That monster tried to eat me!

436
00:23:50,792 --> 00:23:51,626
Huh...

437
00:23:51,793 --> 00:23:53,419
Why would that be?

438
00:23:54,587 --> 00:23:57,256
Would you all perhaps like to
go back to the real world?

439
00:23:57,298 --> 00:23:58,257
You bet!

440
00:23:58,299 --> 00:23:59,133
Pika!

441
00:23:59,134 --> 00:24:01,928
I have to get to
the Flower Garden right away!

442
00:24:02,303 --> 00:24:04,513
Then in that case there's
not a moment to lose.

443
00:24:04,681 --> 00:24:06,307
- Pika?
- What does that mean?

444
00:24:06,307 --> 00:24:07,933
All right, there's still time.

445
00:24:08,309 --> 00:24:09,727
Come on, be lively!

446
00:24:10,645 --> 00:24:11,354
Pip?

447
00:24:12,439 --> 00:24:13,189
Piplup!

448
00:24:15,984 --> 00:24:18,236
This place looks like
a circus funhouse.

449
00:24:18,278 --> 00:24:20,697
But we're not having fun
and we're all alone.

450
00:24:20,905 --> 00:24:23,699
Hey, I've heard of not having
any idea which end's up,

451
00:24:23,741 --> 00:24:24,450
but this?

452
00:24:24,492 --> 00:24:26,827
This is ridiculous, even for us!

453
00:24:26,828 --> 00:24:28,621
(Team Rocket) - That's saying something.
- That's saying something.

454
00:24:42,552 --> 00:24:44,845
Whoa, man!

455
00:24:46,181 --> 00:24:48,308
(Newton) I became obsessed
with the Reverse World

456
00:24:48,349 --> 00:24:50,434
and started researching
it exhaustively.

457
00:24:50,685 --> 00:24:54,438
The next thing I knew
five years had gone by.

458
00:24:54,814 --> 00:24:55,898
Funny guy...

459
00:24:55,899 --> 00:24:57,650
Well he seems impressive!

460
00:24:57,692 --> 00:24:58,984
(Shaymin)
He's a weirdo!

461
00:25:01,821 --> 00:25:02,822
(Dawn)
What's that?

462
00:25:03,865 --> 00:25:06,492
(Newton) When there are
imbalances in the real world,

463
00:25:06,534 --> 00:25:09,411
this world then corrects
them to maintain the balance

464
00:25:09,454 --> 00:25:10,830
between time and space.

465
00:25:11,164 --> 00:25:13,749
Whenever this occurs
a black cloud appears!

466
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:14,625

One quick breath

You see, once time and space,

479
00:25:48,076 --> 00:25:50,703
two dimensions that never
should've met, collided

480
00:25:51,079 --> 00:25:52,789
and unraveled each other!

482
00:26:04,342 --> 00:26:07,261
Dialga and Palkia both
thought that their territories

483
00:26:07,262 --> 00:26:08,638
had been violated,

484
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,723
so they began fighting fiercely.

Whoa...

Remember that?

Back in Alamos Town!

488
00:26:13,768 --> 00:26:16,979
As a result, both time and
space were bent violently,

489

and the sum total
of the Reverse World

490
00:26:19,023 --> 00:26:21,817
started overflowing with
all of this toxicify.

Giratina was absolutely
furious with Dialga and Palkia

for defiling its home,

494

00:27:15,622 --> 00:27:17,290
Right, angry with Shaymin!

504
00:27:17,332 --> 00:27:19,208
Really, really angry!

505
00:27:27,884 --> 00:27:29,135
(Newton)
But that's not all.

506
00:27:29,344 --> 00:27:31,971
Giratina can no longer
go into the real world

507
00:27:32,013 --> 00:27:33,305
because of Dialga!

508
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,891
- Serves Giratina right!
- Pika...

509
00:27:35,933 --> 00:27:37,893
Let the punishment fit the crime!

510
00:27:37,894 --> 00:27:38,728
Pika?

511
00:27:39,228 --> 00:27:40,354
Look, it's Brock!

512
00:27:40,563 --> 00:27:41,313
You're right!

513
00:27:41,356 --> 00:27:42,982
He's still back there!

514
00:27:45,985 --> 00:27:46,944
Come on.

515
00:27:46,986 --> 00:27:49,405
You guys...where are you?

516
00:27:49,489 --> 00:27:50,573
Hey, Brock!

517
00:27:50,573 --> 00:27:51,615
Can you hear us?

518
00:27:52,367 --> 00:27:53,701
- Stop it!
- Pika!

519
00:27:57,246 --> 00:27:59,289
If something gets destroyed here,

520
00:27:59,374 --> 00:28:01,709
it has a big influence
on the real world.

521
00:28:02,543 --> 00:28:06,129
Any changes to those bubbles
are reflected in the real world.

522
00:28:07,674 --> 00:28:10,760
Now gravify gets strange
again starting right here.

523
00:28:13,846 --> 00:28:15,264
- But it can be kind of fun!

I've got to say,
I'm thoroughly impressed!

Sorry but flattery will
get you nowhere.

541
00:29:20,955 --> 00:29:21,747
Whatever!

542
00:29:21,789 --> 00:29:22,706
We've got to go!

Now hurry or you
won't be able to get out!

Right.

559
00:30:05,416 --> 00:30:07,418
Giratina can see
into the real world,

560
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:10,254
so watch your step
and also beware of mirrors!

We want to go home too!

Yeah, leave this weightless stuff
for the astronauts!

567
00:30:48,543 --> 00:30:50,169
(computer)
Giratina is surfacing.

(Zero)
ls Dialga nearby?

569
00:30:51,879 --> 00:30:54,298
No, it's outside
of the radar's field.

570
00:30:59,303 --> 00:31:02,514
Infi, zoom in on the spot where
Giratina tried to surface...

571
00:31:02,932 --> 00:31:03,682
Right!

572
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:09,438
(Brock)
Where'd you all go?

573
00:31:09,605 --> 00:31:10,856
(Ash)
To the Reverse World!

574
00:31:11,357 --> 00:31:12,232
What's that?

575
00:31:12,316 --> 00:31:13,233
Where's Newton?

576
00:31:13,234 --> 00:31:14,443
He stayed back there.

Pika?

578
00:31:15,862 --> 00:31:17,363
He said "beware of mirrors"...

579
00:31:17,446 --> 00:31:18,363
The mirror?

580
00:31:19,657 --> 00:31:21,533
It's coming this way!

581
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:24,328
This place's dangerous

582
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:25,329
Let's go!

583
00:31:25,663 --> 00:31:27,498
(Brock)
Tell me what's going on!

584
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:33,712
I see...

585
00:31:33,754 --> 00:31:35,297
So that's how it is.

586
00:31:36,132 --> 00:31:37,258
(Infi)
Be careful.

587
00:31:37,341 --> 00:31:38,925
I await your return.

A Giratina?

589
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,474
In the Reverse World?

590
00:31:46,267 --> 00:31:47,893
I wish I could have seen that...

591
00:31:47,935 --> 00:31:50,145
(Dawn) Then you would've
seen how dangerous it was!

592
00:31:50,146 --> 00:31:52,356
Thanks to me you're
all safe and sound!

593
00:31:52,732 --> 00:31:54,650
Aren't you grateful I'm around?

594
00:31:54,692 --> 00:31:56,694
Don't forget it was you
that got us in this mess

595
00:31:56,736 --> 00:31:57,903
in the first place!

596
00:31:58,112 --> 00:31:59,988
It's time to step up to the plate!

597
00:31:59,989 --> 00:32:02,825
It's time for you to get me
to the Flower Garden!

And how do you know our Shaymin?

I don't know him!

Yeah, what a lucky guy!

672
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,853
Hey, I'll bet that's why
you've got such a cute wife!

673
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,774
It's so cute!

674
00:35:23,025 --> 00:35:24,192
It's gonna bite!

675
00:35:25,444 --> 00:35:26,361
It's all right.

676
00:35:26,362 --> 00:35:27,529
I don't bite.

677
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:29,072
Hey!

678
00:35:30,825 --> 00:35:32,034
May I hold it?

679
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:33,201
Of course!

680
00:35:35,371 --> 00:35:36,789
There, there...

681
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:53,263
Giratina's moving again!

682
00:35:54,098 --> 00:35:56,058
- Professor!
- Don't leave us in the lurch!

683
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:59,061
Then come with me if
you want to learn something!

684
00:36:00,688 --> 00:36:02,398
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.

685
00:36:07,987 --> 00:36:09,905
Amazing! They're like twins!

686
00:36:09,947 --> 00:36:10,739
Yeah!

687
00:36:11,031 --> 00:36:11,948
What're those?

688
00:36:11,991 --> 00:36:13,659
Gracidea flowers, Dawn!

689
00:36:13,909 --> 00:36:15,493
Gracidea flowers?

690
00:36:18,706 --> 00:36:21,041
Around these parts if you
really want to show someone

691
00:36:21,041 --> 00:36:23,877
your gratitude you send them
a bouquet of Gracidea Flowers,

692
00:36:23,878 --> 00:36:26,380
since they look like
Shaymin the Gratitude Pokémon!

693
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:29,174
But it's wonderful that I'm
getting to hold the real thing!

694
00:36:29,216 --> 00:36:31,426
- You're grateful, right?
- Yeah!

695
00:36:31,927 --> 00:36:33,720
You'd better be
careful with that one!

696
00:36:33,721 --> 00:36:35,514
It might blow up at any moment!

697
00:36:35,639 --> 00:36:38,308
I don't do that to nice people!

698
00:36:39,602 --> 00:36:42,354
Layla and all her friends are
going back to their hometown.

699
00:36:42,396 --> 00:36:45,107
It's my great-grandmother's
hundredth birthday!

700
00:36:45,149 --> 00:36:47,651
She took such good care of
me when I was a little girl,

701
00:36:47,693 --> 00:36:50,696
so I figured I would give her
a bouquet of Gracidea Flowers

702
00:36:50,738 --> 00:36:52,114
to show my gratitude!

703
00:36:55,993 --> 00:36:56,785
Min?

704
00:36:58,996 --> 00:36:59,830
Min?

705
00:37:08,672 --> 00:37:09,631
Piplup!

706
00:37:16,263 --> 00:37:17,264
Pika!

707
00:37:23,604 --> 00:37:24,646
Pika?

708
00:37:24,647 --> 00:37:25,773
Shaymin!

709
00:37:29,777 --> 00:37:31,028
Pika!

710
00:37:32,154 --> 00:37:35,991
[laughing]
Whee!

711
00:37:36,575 --> 00:37:38,827
- It's flying!
- Piplup!

712
00:37:45,459 --> 00:37:46,501
What happened?

713
00:37:46,543 --> 00:37:48,628
See, Shaymin changes into Sky Form

714
00:37:48,629 --> 00:37:51,256
when it comes in contact
with Gracidea pollen!

715
00:37:51,465 --> 00:37:53,175
Is that part of the Flower Bearing?

716
00:37:53,175 --> 00:37:55,677
Right! The Shaymin gather
at a Gracidea Garden

717
00:37:55,719 --> 00:37:58,179
where they change into
Sky Form and fly off!

718
00:37:58,973 --> 00:37:59,848
Pika!

719
00:37:59,848 --> 00:38:02,016
Do you know where
the Gracidea Garden is?

720
00:38:02,059 --> 00:38:03,310
We're lookin' for it!

721
00:38:03,936 --> 00:38:05,729
Excuse me, coming through!

722
00:38:05,771 --> 00:38:06,605
Follow me!

723
00:38:09,149 --> 00:38:10,733
Okay, check out this map.

724
00:38:10,943 --> 00:38:12,486
Here's where we are right now!

725
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:15,239
If you transfer to a boat
at the next station,

726
00:38:15,281 --> 00:38:17,783
the Gracidea Garden
will be around here.

727
00:38:18,033 --> 00:38:21,077
You picked a good time 'cause
the flowers are ready to bloom.

728
00:38:22,246 --> 00:38:23,288
You see?

729
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:24,873
I have to go right away!

730
00:38:24,915 --> 00:38:26,541
My friends are all there!

731
00:38:26,792 --> 00:38:28,877
If I do not make it
before the flowers bloom,

732
00:38:28,919 --> 00:38:30,337
I'll be left behind.

733
00:38:30,587 --> 00:38:32,088
That's why you were in a rush!

734
00:38:32,131 --> 00:38:33,298
Exactly!

735
00:38:36,218 --> 00:38:39,596
Giratina was a problem,
but I'm fine now.

736
00:38:39,638 --> 00:38:42,265
I can fly there anytime I want!

737
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:44,142
I wanna see the Flower Bearing too!

738
00:38:44,184 --> 00:38:46,019
- Piplup!
- Yeah, me too!

739
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,271
Can't wait to see it!

740
00:38:47,313 --> 00:38:48,188
Pika!

741
00:38:48,188 --> 00:38:49,731
It's something to see.

742
00:38:50,065 --> 00:38:51,858
I love when things turn out right!

743
00:38:53,235 --> 00:38:54,069
Pika?

744
00:38:54,194 --> 00:38:56,571
Magnezone!

745
00:39:08,709 --> 00:39:09,960
What do they want?

746
00:39:10,002 --> 00:39:12,087
They're all trying to
capture Shaymin!

747
00:39:12,296 --> 00:39:15,257
No chance you're
ever going to get me!

748
00:39:15,257 --> 00:39:17,092
Magnemite, Magnemite!

749
00:39:19,178 --> 00:39:21,930
Shaymin!

750
00:39:24,141 --> 00:39:25,267
Told ya!

751
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,353
Now Pikachu, Iron Tail!

752
00:39:28,854 --> 00:39:30,230

00:39:35,736 --> 00:39:37,195
Wow, well done!

756
00:39:37,237 --> 00:39:38,780
Pikachu, Pika!

757
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,283

00:40:22,324 --> 00:40:26,161
Magnezone!

774
00:40:26,662 --> 00:40:28,580
Pikachu, Thunderbolt, let's go!

775
00:40:28,622 --> 00:40:30,165
Now, Piplup, Bubblebeam!

776
00:40:30,207 --> 00:40:34,336
- Pika, Pikachu!
- Lup, Lup, Lup, Lup!

781
00:40:50,352 --> 00:40:51,644
Pikachu!

782
00:40:55,732 --> 00:40:57,024
Every last one of them!

783
00:40:57,067 --> 00:40:59,402
Have you changed a little
or is it just me?

784
00:41:00,279 --> 00:41:02,572
It's thank Shaymin time!

785
00:41:02,614 --> 00:41:05,199
- It's just you, Brock!
- Pikachu.

786
00:41:05,868 --> 00:41:07,578
Gull!

787
00:41:07,619 --> 00:41:08,953

Gull!

790
00:41:11,748 --> 00:41:13,750
- Piplup, Piplup!
- Thanks for everything everybody!

791
00:41:13,792 --> 00:41:15,752
Pika, Pika!

792
00:41:15,794 --> 00:41:17,253
Have a safe trip!

793
00:41:17,296 --> 00:41:20,132
And make sure you don't
get <i>off</i> in the wrong place!

794
00:41:20,424 --> 00:41:22,050
(Dawn)
No need to worry!

795
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:23,051
(Ash)
We'll be fine!

796
00:41:23,093 --> 00:41:24,886
(man)
Be careful!

797
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:34,771
(Infi)
Welcome back, Sir.

798
00:41:36,356 --> 00:41:37,523
How's Giratina?

799
00:41:38,192 --> 00:41:40,485
Giratina's surfaced just once.

800
00:41:40,527 --> 00:41:41,694
I knew it.

801
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:47,116
Calculate where
Giratina will surface next.

802
00:41:47,826 --> 00:41:49,786
Already in process.

803
00:41:56,793 --> 00:41:59,086
(Dawn)
Brock, isn't this part of the sea?

804
00:41:59,421 --> 00:42:02,257
(Brock) The fact is, a glacier
wore away the mountain here

805
00:42:02,299 --> 00:42:04,551
and created this valley
a long time ago...

806
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,969
(Ash)
A glacier?

807
00:42:07,012 --> 00:42:07,804
Like this!

808
00:42:08,013 --> 00:42:10,390
Ice has been covering and
wearing away at this mountain

809
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:12,433
- for tens of thousands of years!
- Pika!

810
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:13,393
Whoa!

811
00:42:13,393 --> 00:42:14,435
Looks cold!

812
00:42:14,478 --> 00:42:17,230
And there's a glacier located
deep in the Flower Garden

813
00:42:17,231 --> 00:42:18,482
we're headed to as well.

814

00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:56,203
Pikachu, you flying with 'em?

840
00:43:56,455 --> 00:43:57,372
Pika!

841
00:43:58,707 --> 00:44:01,584
- Staravia!
- Pikachu!

842
00:44:02,836 --> 00:44:04,337
Pika!

843
00:44:08,091 --> 00:44:09,759
Staravia!

844
00:44:10,427 --> 00:44:11,886
Star!

845
00:44:16,308 --> 00:44:17,559
Staravia!

846
00:44:18,310 --> 00:44:20,353
Pika!

847
00:44:21,521 --> 00:44:23,064
Min!

848
00:44:25,984 --> 00:44:27,735
Pika, Pika!

849
00:44:28,654 --> 00:44:29,905
- Piplup!
- Pika!

850
00:44:29,946 --> 00:44:31,948
Piplup!

851
00:44:45,629 --> 00:44:46,546
Pika!

852
00:44:50,967 --> 00:44:51,634
Oh, no!

853
00:44:51,677 --> 00:44:53,136
You're coming as well!

854
00:44:53,512 --> 00:44:54,387
Pity...

855
00:44:54,388 --> 00:44:56,181
Much too heavy.

856
00:44:56,390 --> 00:44:57,224
Ouch!

857
00:44:58,725 --> 00:44:59,767
- Pika?
- Staravia!

858
00:44:59,810 --> 00:45:01,311
Pika!

859
00:45:02,104 --> 00:45:03,939
- Altaria!
- Star!

860
00:45:03,939 --> 00:45:07,400
Altaria! Altaria, Altaria!

861
00:45:07,401 --> 00:45:09,611
Pika!

862
00:45:10,070 --> 00:45:11,112
Yeah!

863
00:45:14,658 --> 00:45:16,451
Shaymin's sure having fun!

864
00:45:16,451 --> 00:45:18,870
Just like it'll be
at the Flower Garden!

865
00:45:18,912 --> 00:45:21,247
Flying <i>off</i> with all its friends.

866
00:45:23,291 --> 00:45:25,876
Guess we won't have
much more time together.

867
00:45:27,379 --> 00:45:28,254
Shaymin...

868
00:45:33,719 --> 00:45:34,720
Know what?

869
00:45:34,761 --> 00:45:36,429
It's kind of a relief.

870
00:45:37,264 --> 00:45:38,139
Hey!

871
00:45:38,265 --> 00:45:40,308
Ow, ow!

872
00:45:50,068 --> 00:45:52,236
As you can see,
we've finally succeeded

873
00:45:52,279 --> 00:45:54,197
in entering
the Reverse World!

874
00:45:54,239 --> 00:45:55,156
(man)
Watch out!

875
00:45:58,452 --> 00:45:59,369
Master!

876
00:46:00,162 --> 00:46:03,373
Only Giratina can move freely
in and out of this world!

877
00:46:03,582 --> 00:46:06,001
Then let's grab
that power ourselves!

878
00:46:06,042 --> 00:46:06,917
Right!

879
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:14,675
Soon, it will all be mine...

880
00:46:16,636 --> 00:46:18,346
(Infi)
Giratina has surfaced.

881
00:46:30,734 --> 00:46:33,027
Pip, Pip, Pip, Pip, Pip, Piplup.

882
00:46:34,112 --> 00:46:35,363
What's that?

883
00:46:36,156 --> 00:46:38,324
That's the same thing
we got sucked into before!

884
00:46:38,492 --> 00:46:39,659
Uh-oh!

885
00:46:40,577 --> 00:46:41,536
Let's get out of here!

886
00:46:41,578 --> 00:46:43,413
I'm not going anywhere!

887
00:46:47,167 --> 00:46:49,127
Pika, Pika!

888
00:46:50,170 --> 00:46:52,547
Piplup!

889
00:46:53,048 --> 00:46:55,592
- Pika!
- Star!

890
00:46:57,260 --> 00:46:58,219
Magnezone.

891
00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:01,223
That's the entrance
into the Reverse World.

892
00:47:03,517 --> 00:47:04,392
Let's go!

893
00:47:04,893 --> 00:47:06,102
Magnezone!

894
00:47:07,813 --> 00:47:08,855
Magnemite!

895
00:47:14,653 --> 00:47:16,029
Piplup!

896
00:47:18,865 --> 00:47:19,782
Star!

897
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:21,867
Staravia!

898
00:47:25,997 --> 00:47:27,665
This is the Reverse World?

899
00:47:27,707 --> 00:47:29,041
(Ash)
We're back again!

900
00:47:31,962 --> 00:47:33,421
- Oh no!
- Pip!

901
00:47:33,463 --> 00:47:36,132
- It's Giratina!
- It's huge!

902
00:47:40,470 --> 00:47:42,597
Giratina, I'm challenging you!

903
00:47:42,639 --> 00:47:44,265
You go, Shaymin!

904
00:47:44,808 --> 00:47:46,559
Shaymin!

905
00:47:55,777 --> 00:47:57,445
That's what I was afraid of!

906
00:47:57,571 --> 00:47:59,489
Pikachu, Thunderbolt, let's go!

907
00:47:59,656 --> 00:48:00,698
Help Shaymin!

908
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:02,950
- Pikachu!
- Staravia!

909
00:48:04,035 --> 00:48:04,952
Star!

910
00:48:04,953 --> 00:48:08,122
Pikachu!

911
00:48:13,753 --> 00:48:14,837
Pika!

912
00:48:25,390 --> 00:48:27,975
Shaymin!

913
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:36,359
Shaymin!

914
00:48:37,027 --> 00:48:37,777
Lup!

915
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:39,821
Min!

916
00:48:40,113 --> 00:48:42,490
Min!

917
00:48:42,532 --> 00:48:43,783
Staravia!

918
00:48:45,410 --> 00:48:46,911
Pikachu!

919
00:48:48,914 --> 00:48:49,456
Star!

920
00:48:49,456 --> 00:48:51,583
- Pika!
- Staravia!

921
00:48:52,626 --> 00:48:53,668
Min!

922
00:48:53,793 --> 00:48:54,752
Min!

923
00:48:55,128 --> 00:48:55,711
Min!

924
00:48:55,754 --> 00:48:56,671
Pika!

925
00:49:00,342 --> 00:49:02,677
I guess I didn't want to be eaten!

926
00:49:05,055 --> 00:49:07,182
But, what happened to
all your strength?

927
00:49:07,223 --> 00:49:09,183
I'm not so good at night...

928
00:49:09,559 --> 00:49:12,311
It could be be that Shaymin
can only take on Sky Form

929
00:49:12,312 --> 00:49:13,730
during the daytime...

930
00:49:18,902 --> 00:49:21,195
Why can't you run any faster?

931
00:49:21,196 --> 00:49:23,406
Why're you always on me
when we're running'?

932
00:49:23,490 --> 00:49:25,700
So we'll be eaten together!
That's why!

933
00:49:25,742 --> 00:49:26,993
Very Funny!

934
00:49:29,704 --> 00:49:31,747
Quick Pikachu, use Thunderbolt!

935
00:49:31,873 --> 00:49:36,373
Pikachu!

936
00:49:37,671 --> 00:49:39,089
Pika!

937
00:49:41,466 --> 00:49:42,800
(Newton)
Hello!

938
00:49:43,051 --> 00:49:45,511
Ash, Dawn, up here!

939
00:49:45,804 --> 00:49:47,305
- Wow, it's Newton!
- Pip?

940
00:49:47,472 --> 00:49:48,222
Newton?

941
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:49,807
- Pikachu!
- Pika!

942
00:49:50,350 --> 00:49:52,477
Hi, Newton, I'm Brock!

943
00:49:52,519 --> 00:49:53,770
Nice to meet you!

944
00:49:55,522 --> 00:49:58,149
This isn't a place people
usually come back to!

945
00:49:58,358 --> 00:49:59,400
But, this way!

946
00:50:02,737 --> 00:50:03,988
Staravia!

947
00:50:08,868 --> 00:50:10,327
(Ash)
Staravia, return!

948
00:50:11,997 --> 00:50:14,249
You're all quite a handful,
aren't you?

949
00:50:14,791 --> 00:50:17,668
Okay, whatever, you're taking me
to the Flower Garden right?

950
00:50:18,211 --> 00:50:19,795
Giratina's out there.

951
00:50:19,921 --> 00:50:22,048
We can't just waltz out of here.

952
00:50:22,048 --> 00:50:24,133
You'll all abandon me, I know it!

953
00:50:24,175 --> 00:50:27,511
Where's all that confidence
you had back in Sky Form...?

954
00:50:27,721 --> 00:50:29,472
I left it back in the sky!

955
00:50:29,514 --> 00:50:32,350
- I should have known.
- Pikachu!

956
00:50:41,985 --> 00:50:43,778
Home sweet home.

957
00:50:43,945 --> 00:50:45,655
I'm finally back...

958
00:50:46,406 --> 00:50:50,159
Such a beautiful,
quiet and unspoiled world,

959
00:50:50,994 --> 00:50:53,287
where no one can bother me...

960
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:55,039
At last!

961
00:50:57,917 --> 00:50:59,460
Welcome, Master, sir!

962
00:50:59,461 --> 00:51:01,337
We brought you some cool stuff!

963
00:51:03,048 --> 00:51:04,215
How about a hot towel?

964
00:51:04,257 --> 00:51:05,883
And something to wet your whistle?

965
00:51:05,925 --> 00:51:07,801
Well, thank you, thank you.

966
00:51:07,802 --> 00:51:08,969
Team Rocket?

967
00:51:08,970 --> 00:51:10,721
What're you doing here?

968
00:51:11,222 --> 00:51:14,099
Isn't it obvious that we've
become his star pupils?

969
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:16,811
His top trio of
Reverse World wonks!

970
00:51:16,853 --> 00:51:18,980
Actually we just
go and get him junk.

971
00:51:19,355 --> 00:51:20,397
Hold it, Newton!

972
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:21,315
These guys...

973
00:51:21,357 --> 00:51:23,817
...are actually quite
helpful to be honest!

974
00:51:25,904 --> 00:51:28,072
Well, I don't care, I'm hungry!

975
00:51:32,118 --> 00:51:33,494
Give me food.

976
00:51:33,536 --> 00:51:35,204
Gimme a break, greenback!

977
00:51:35,622 --> 00:51:37,498
I ain't got any grub.

978
00:51:39,209 --> 00:51:41,294
Give me food!

979
00:51:42,837 --> 00:51:44,004
(Ash)
Shaymin!

980
00:51:44,172 --> 00:51:45,506
Pika!

981
00:51:46,299 --> 00:51:47,550
Sheildon!

982
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:54,557
Piplup!

983
00:51:54,599 --> 00:51:56,350
The Shaymin's mine.

984
00:51:57,143 --> 00:51:59,478
- Shaymin!
- You again?

985
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:02,022
Pika!

986
00:52:03,483 --> 00:52:05,318
Pikachu!

987
00:52:05,902 --> 00:52:07,194
Who's that dude?

988
00:52:07,237 --> 00:52:09,739
Not sure but I think
we should sit this one out.

989
00:52:09,781 --> 00:52:11,699
Hide this one out too...

990
00:52:16,037 --> 00:52:17,663
No use, can't move!

991
00:52:17,664 --> 00:52:18,539
Zero!

992
00:52:18,665 --> 00:52:19,666
You!

993
00:52:20,125 --> 00:52:22,210
Zero was my assistant once!

994
00:52:23,002 --> 00:52:25,379
If it isn't the good doctor
Newton Graceland.

995
00:52:25,421 --> 00:52:26,964
Long time no see.

996
00:52:27,006 --> 00:52:28,716
You haven't changed a bit...

997
00:52:29,050 --> 00:52:29,842
Save it!

998
00:52:30,009 --> 00:52:31,218
Why did you come here?

999
00:52:31,928 --> 00:52:33,554
You know why. <i>..</i>

1000
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:36,849
To make this wonderful world
all mine!

1001
00:52:36,850 --> 00:52:38,393
You're still on that?

1002
00:52:39,185 --> 00:52:41,478
You have no claim to this world.

1003
00:52:41,521 --> 00:52:42,939
I never said I did!

1004
00:52:42,981 --> 00:52:43,856
Perhaps...

1005
00:52:43,857 --> 00:52:45,733
But you're trying to keep
this beautiful place

1006
00:52:45,775 --> 00:52:46,734
all to yourself!

1007
00:52:46,734 --> 00:52:47,151
Look!

1008
00:52:47,193 --> 00:52:50,696
The Reverse World is vital in
that it sustains the real world!

1009
00:52:51,531 --> 00:52:53,449
I've already figured that out.

1010
00:52:54,868 --> 00:52:55,994
However...

1011
00:53:00,748 --> 00:53:02,332
This place is beautiful.

1012
00:53:02,709 --> 00:53:04,627
But people destroy it!

1013
00:53:04,794 --> 00:53:06,420
Defile and pollute it!

1014
00:53:06,462 --> 00:53:07,045
Wrong!

1015
00:53:07,046 --> 00:53:09,840
Don't you realize
that's this world's job?

1016
00:53:09,883 --> 00:53:13,595
Magnemite, Magnemite, Magnemite,
Magnemite, Magnemite...

1017
00:53:13,595 --> 00:53:15,263
Ah, yes, that's right...

1018
00:53:15,388 --> 00:53:17,765
I've forgotten to mention
that I've finished building

1019
00:53:17,807 --> 00:53:19,433
your invention for you!

1020
00:53:19,434 --> 00:53:20,351
Oh, no!

1021
00:53:21,227 --> 00:53:22,811
Don't breathe in!

1022
00:53:23,021 --> 00:53:25,648
Piplup!

1023
00:53:25,690 --> 00:53:26,607
Min!

1024
00:53:26,858 --> 00:53:28,901
Magnemite, Magnemite!

1025
00:53:31,362 --> 00:53:32,321
Shaymin!

1026
00:53:33,198 --> 00:53:34,282
Dawn!

1027
00:53:34,699 --> 00:53:37,743
Min!

1028
00:53:37,744 --> 00:53:39,036
Shaymin!

1029
00:53:39,454 --> 00:53:43,458
Min!

1030
00:53:43,458 --> 00:53:44,625
There we go.

1031
00:53:44,751 --> 00:53:47,628
Min...

1032
00:53:48,213 --> 00:53:50,173
What a pity, Giratina...

1033
00:53:51,007 --> 00:53:53,801
Because of Dialga,
you lost your ability to travel

1034
00:53:53,801 --> 00:53:55,427
back to the real world,

1035
00:53:55,845 --> 00:53:57,471
but I'll help you...

1036
00:54:00,850 --> 00:54:02,017
Pika!

1037
00:54:02,393 --> 00:54:05,229
Min...

1038
00:54:05,271 --> 00:54:06,438
Of course!

1039
00:54:06,481 --> 00:54:08,065
That's Seed Flare!

1040
00:54:16,658 --> 00:54:18,660
Giratina's here!

1041
00:54:20,411 --> 00:54:23,997
Now, open a hole using Seed Flare!

1042
00:54:24,457 --> 00:54:25,666
Help Giratina...

1043
00:54:26,125 --> 00:54:27,501
Allow it to leave now!

1044
00:54:28,461 --> 00:54:29,336
Hole?

1045
00:54:31,214 --> 00:54:34,050
- Magneton!
- Magnemite, Magnemite!

1046
00:54:34,092 --> 00:54:36,302
- Magnemite!
- Magneton, Magneton!

1047
00:54:36,302 --> 00:54:38,304
It's getting rid of the Magnemite!

1048
00:54:38,388 --> 00:54:41,182
Giratina has no interest
in eating Shaymin!

1049
00:54:46,145 --> 00:54:47,271
Min!

1050
00:54:51,526 --> 00:54:53,611
It's going to eat me!

1051
00:54:56,322 --> 00:54:58,157
Shaymin doesn't understand!

1052
00:55:01,536 --> 00:55:03,079
Here we go!

1053
00:55:06,124 --> 00:55:07,458
Pika!

1054
00:55:21,723 --> 00:55:23,433
Min!

1055
00:55:26,769 --> 00:55:27,770
Pika, Pi!

1056
00:55:27,895 --> 00:55:30,647
Pika!

1057
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:32,399
And now, Giratina...

1058
00:55:32,650 --> 00:55:35,569
Realize your dream and
go to the real world!

1059
00:55:44,037 --> 00:55:45,038
Pika...

1060
00:55:52,295 --> 00:55:53,421
It's a glacier!

1061
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:54,922
(Dawn)
Shaymin!

1062
00:55:59,302 --> 00:56:00,761
Shaymin, you all right?

1063
00:56:00,970 --> 00:56:03,097
It was about to eat me!

1064
00:56:03,181 --> 00:56:03,931
You're wrong.

1065
00:56:04,015 --> 00:56:06,434
Giratina wasn't trying to eat you...

1066
00:56:13,191 --> 00:56:16,110
Giratina only wanted to
get you to use Seed Flare

1067
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:18,278
so it could come forth
into this world.

1068
00:56:18,571 --> 00:56:21,490
It was also trying to get rid of
all the Magnemite!

1069
00:56:23,910 --> 00:56:25,119
Piplup!

1070
00:56:35,171 --> 00:56:36,547
It looks different!

1071
00:56:36,756 --> 00:56:39,717
It probably has to do with
the gravify change...

1072
00:56:39,801 --> 00:56:40,802
Pika!

1073
00:56:45,264 --> 00:56:48,642
♪♪

1074
00:56:56,109 --> 00:56:57,151
Pika!

1075
00:56:58,152 --> 00:56:59,695
- What's that?
- Piplup!

1076
00:57:27,598 --> 00:57:29,141
Magnezone!

1077
00:57:30,810 --> 00:57:34,104
Giratina, I have been waiting
such a long time now

1078
00:57:34,147 --> 00:57:35,523
for you to come here!

1079
00:57:39,944 --> 00:57:40,861
Pika?

1080
00:57:41,654 --> 00:57:43,614
What is Zero up to?

1081
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:04,927
(Infi) Giratina is
returning to its condition

1082
00:58:04,969 --> 00:58:07,012
before making
contact with Dialga.

1083
00:58:07,013 --> 00:58:09,015
It is already capable of
entering and leaving

1084
00:58:09,015 --> 00:58:09,890
the Reverse World.

1085
00:58:09,932 --> 00:58:12,976
Giratina's Reverse World arrival
has shattered the time loop.

1086
00:58:13,519 --> 00:58:16,563
Infi, now,
commence scanning process!

1087
00:58:17,023 --> 00:58:17,815
Understood.

1088
00:58:17,857 --> 00:58:19,984
Beginning scan immediately.

1089
00:58:37,418 --> 00:58:38,419
It's true...

1090
00:58:38,544 --> 00:58:40,295
I designed that machine.

1091
00:58:41,047 --> 00:58:43,049
I built it so I'd be able to absorb

1092
00:58:43,049 --> 00:58:44,842
all of Giratina's Abilities!

1093
00:58:44,884 --> 00:58:46,844
But why would you do that?

1094
00:58:49,555 --> 00:58:52,474
So I could enter and leave
the Reverse World at will!

1095
00:58:53,351 --> 00:58:54,393
At that point...

1096
00:58:56,646 --> 00:58:59,065
I realized Giratina
would then be sacrificed!

1097
00:59:01,943 --> 00:59:03,611
This project is terminated!

1098
00:59:03,611 --> 00:59:04,445
Master...

1099
00:59:04,445 --> 00:59:05,737
What are you saying?

1100
00:59:05,947 --> 00:59:08,407
We can't use Giratina
as a sacrifice

1101
00:59:08,407 --> 00:59:10,283
just for the sake of our research!

1102
00:59:20,086 --> 00:59:21,212
What are you doing?

1103
00:59:29,387 --> 00:59:30,596
My blueprints...

1104
00:59:30,930 --> 00:59:32,514
I'm deleting all of them!

1105
00:59:36,352 --> 00:59:37,144
(Newton)
But...

1106
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:39,939
Obviously Zero never forgot them!

1107
00:59:40,606 --> 00:59:43,609
And if that thing was built
to my specifications,

1108
00:59:43,609 --> 00:59:46,737
Giratina will soon be no more.

1109
00:59:46,904 --> 00:59:49,031
- You mean Giratina's...
- Pika!

1110
00:59:52,326 --> 00:59:55,370
It won't be long before
the Reverse World is all mine!

1111
00:59:56,038 --> 00:59:58,498
And then I will rule there
like a king!

1112
00:59:58,749 --> 01:00:02,836

1113

01:00:10,469 --> 01:00:11,720
Where're you going?

1117
01:00:11,887 --> 01:00:13,597
This whole thing is my fault.

1118
01:00:14,056 --> 01:00:16,308
I have to make
sure Giratina's safe!

1119
01:00:16,309 --> 01:00:17,518
I'm comin' too!

1120
01:00:17,810 --> 01:00:18,936
- Me too!
- Piplup!

1121
01:00:19,437 --> 01:00:20,896
Shaymin, you wait here.

1122
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:23,982
Piplup!

1123
01:00:32,867 --> 01:00:33,826
Finally!

1124
01:00:34,535 --> 01:00:36,954
This is the Gracidea Flower Garden!

1125
01:00:46,130 --> 01:00:47,965
Well, I'm going on ahead!

1126
01:00:48,174 --> 01:00:49,049
Shaymin!

1127
01:00:49,175 --> 01:00:50,092
Let's go!

1128
01:00:50,134 --> 01:00:51,051
- Right!
- Right!

1129
01:00:51,969 --> 01:00:53,261
Hey!

1130
01:00:53,888 --> 01:00:55,890
I'm starting to sense a pattern...

1131
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:06,984
He can't...

1132
01:01:07,276 --> 01:01:09,027
- He won't!
- Pika!

1133
01:01:09,862 --> 01:01:12,114
We will all help Giratina!

1134
01:01:12,657 --> 01:01:13,824
Take care of them.

Prepare to enter the Reverse World.

1142
01:01:46,357 --> 01:01:47,566
(Infi)
As you wish.

1143
01:02:01,163 --> 01:02:02,956
Pikachu, Thunderbolt, now!

1144
01:02:02,998 --> 01:02:04,290
Bubblebeam, Piplup, let's go!

01:02:04,291 --> 01:02:07,043
- Piplup, Lup, Lup!
- Chu!

1146
01:02:09,255 --> 01:02:10,965
It didn't do a thing!

1147
01:02:10,965 --> 01:02:12,508
They bounced right off!

1148
01:02:12,550 --> 01:02:14,969
Then I'll have to go in
and stop him myself!

Newton!

1155
01:03:00,306 --> 01:03:02,016
I should be able to
get in through here!

Chu!

1158
01:03:05,561 --> 01:03:07,187
We'll take care of the Magnemite!

1159
01:03:07,188 --> 01:03:08,564
(Shaymin)
I'll help too!

1160
01:03:08,606 --> 01:03:10,316
