2
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,800
Oh, fuck!

3
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,555
I wasn't trying to escape.

4
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:45,007
No, please.
Don't.

5
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:55,007
Oh, God. I don't want to die.

6
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:02,204
Yeah. Yeah, I'll make you clean.

7
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:09,386
I'm sorry.

8
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,222
I didn't mean to...

9
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:53,809
Hey, sis.

10
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:56,007
What time is it?

11
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,743
Just after 8:00.

12
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,110
You want me to make coffee?

13
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:01,779
No, I gotta go. I'll call you later.

14
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:04,279
You sure there's nothing I can do?

15
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:07,918
Angie, everything's gonna be fine.
Just go back to sleep.

16
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:53,502
<i>All right, I'm coming, I'm coming.</i>

17
00:07:57,543 --> 00:07:58,874
Ben Carson.

18
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:03,143
Lorenzo Sapelli. I've been waiting for you.
Come on in.

19
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:04,205
Thanks.

20
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:12,390
How long you been working here?

21
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:16,258
All together? Fifteen years.

22
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:19,562
You were here for the fire?

23
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,031
Devastating.

24
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:26,503
Entire building up in flames.

25
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:39,111
It has been five years since the fire.

26
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:42,916
They're still in a legal battle
with the insurance companies.

27
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:46,447
Even cleaning up this mess is impossible.

28
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,689
I've given up faith about reopening,
and besides,

29
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:53,664
who'd ever want to shop here
after everything that's happened?

30
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:57,536
You know, the Meredith family
acquired this building

31
00:08:57,603 --> 00:09:01,198
after St. Matthew's Hospital
closed in 1952.

32
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:05,605
It was the very first Mayflower
to open on the East Coast.

33
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:11,973
Yeah, the company wants us to patrol
the premises every couple of hours,

34
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:15,885
but I do my rounds every three.
That's more than enough.

35
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:20,790
Anyway, you'll see, not too much
going on. It's pretty calm around here.

36
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:26,757
Well, there you go.

37
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,231
Perfume and cosmetics department,
what's left of it anyway.

38
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:40,371
Thank God you didn't show up any later.
This place gives me the creeps at night.

39
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:42,004
No electricity.

40
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:44,677
All these mirrors.

41
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:48,987
- Best to keep your eyes away from them.
- You polish them?

42
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:52,189
- I'm sorry?
- The mirrors, they're so clean.

43
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:55,318
No, that's Gary. Gary Lewis.

44
00:09:55,394 --> 00:09:57,828
Fellow who was working here before you.

45
00:09:57,897 --> 00:10:00,365
He was completely obsessed
with these damn mirrors.

46
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,833
Spent the entire night cleaning them.

47
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:07,639
How long has it been
since you left the NYPD?

48
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:11,973
About a year.

49
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:16,674
I know it's none of my business,
but why did you resign from the force?

50
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,552
You used to be a detective,
is that correct?

51
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:22,247
Yeah.

52
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:24,583
I'm sorry.

53
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:26,955
I always been too curious.

54
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:28,550
It's all right.

55
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:40,498
There was a pretty big team
working here before the fire.

56
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:44,703
You know, when you stop to think,
of all the department stores in New York,

57
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:48,213
this one was the most beautiful,
most luxurious.

58
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:52,208
I mean, it breaks your heart, it really does.

59
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:54,748
Well, here you go.

60
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:58,117
This is where you'll be spending
most of your time.

61
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:01,023
At least you got electricity in here.

62
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:03,527
It's warm. It's nice.

63
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:05,029
You've even got a TV.

64
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:22,474
<i>I opened up the trunk,
which he so called hid the pictures.</i>

65
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:25,415
<i>I grabbed the goody bag,
walked to the backyard,</i>

66
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:29,545
<i>opened up the barbecue grill,
I grabbed the lighter fluid,</i>

67
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:31,351
Waiting to Exhale.

68
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,856
Hello?

69
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:36,085
Hello.

70
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:39,131
- Hey, Rosa, how are you doing?
- I'm fine. Let me help you.

71
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,563
Thanks.

72
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:42,860
Where are the kids?

73
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:45,529
<i>Upstairs with Señor Ben.</i>

74
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:48,834
Thanks.

75
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:52,537
So everybody at my school
thinks this boy named Eamon,

76
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:57,105
which is, like, one of my best friends,
which is a boy, likes me.

77
00:11:57,183 --> 00:12:01,677
And this girl named Christiana,
who liked him, is just now gossiping.

78
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:03,119
You want me to talk to Mrs. Ward?

79
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:07,888
She'll make them want to wrap me up
in toilet paper for Halloween.

80
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,757
- Hey.
- Hey.

81
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:12,024
Look, Mommy. Look what Daddy got me.

82
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:15,192
It looks great. You'll have to show me
how it works later, okay?

83
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:17,531
It's so fast, Mommy.

84
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:19,764
Ben? Can I talk to you?

85
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,767
Yeah. Okay, you two.

86
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:26,141
You need to finish your homework.
You need to get ready for your bath.

87
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:27,702
Come on. No fooling around, let's go.

88
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,805
Okay, let's go, Michael.

89
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:33,477
Hey. Come here.

90
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:36,248
Happy, happy birthday.

91
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:38,119
- Thanks, Dad.
- Yeah.

92
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:41,048
- Hey.
- Hey.

93
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:56,871
- What is this?
- What?

94
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:59,410
I've asked you
not to drop by without calling.

95
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:00,843
You won't answer my calls.

96
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:02,346
Please, Ben,
I don't want to argue with you.

97
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:05,815
I don't want to argue, either. If you're not
gonna answer my calls, what...

98
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:10,646
I haven't had a drink
for over three months,

99
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:12,987
but since you won't answer your calls,
how would you know?

100
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:14,650
I don't want to know.

101
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:16,758
What I want is for you
to respect my needs.

102
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:19,423
Amy, I'm doing everything I can
to respect your needs.

103
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:21,557
I haven't had a drink.

104
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:24,000
I got a new job to hold me over
till I'm reinstated.

105
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:27,596
I'm doing everything I can
to get back on my feet again.

106
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,439
What?

107
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:34,376
You don't think people can change?

108
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:37,973
We're not talking about people.
We're talking about you.

109
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,041
Amy, I killed a man.

110
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:42,814
You don't just get over that.

111
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:44,856
I needed time. I needed you.

112
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:46,824
- I was right here.
- Yeah.

113
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:48,359
Judging me like everybody else.

114
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:50,588
How dare you say that to me?

115
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:53,131
I was the only one at the precinct
who defended you.

116
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,464
How many times did I chase reporters
off our front lawn?

117
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:59,060
How can you say that to me?

118
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:00,332
I've always been in your corner!

119
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:02,306
I've been the only one
who believed in you!

120
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:04,205
You're fucking unbelievable!

121
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:06,244
Please, I didn't come here to fight.

122
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:09,611
Look, I'm sorry that I came over
without calling.

123
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:12,946
I just wanted to see them.

124
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,246
But we have to set up some rules.

125
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,254
What fucking rules?

126
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:18,882
Come on, Amy,
just tell me what rules I need to follow

127
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,552
so I can see my son on his birthday!

128
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:23,818
Look at yourself.

129
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:28,028
This is exactly what I'm talking about.

130
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:32,196
I don't know how you're going to be
from one moment to the next.

131
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:36,833
When I get around you, I get nervous.

132
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:39,935
Because I am so scared
that I am losing you.

133
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,772
And I screw everything up.

134
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:47,946
- I've missed you so much.
- I miss you, too.

135
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:51,721
Amy, we deserve another chance.

136
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:56,523
I know how much I love you, and I know
somewhere inside there, you love me, too.

137
00:14:57,997 --> 00:14:59,191
Please.

138
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:04,233
Please.

139
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:18,209
I can't do this.

140
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:20,581
I can't do this, Ben.

141
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:25,716
Fuck.

142
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:33,501
Holy shit.

143
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:53,952
What the hell?

144
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:50,407
Fuck!

145
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,847
Man.

146
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:02,587
What the...

147
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:50,739
- You should stop taking those pills.
- Jesus!

148
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:55,637
How are you doing today?

149
00:21:56,648 --> 00:22:00,812
I'm fine. I feel a lot better.
I'm leaving in a couple of minutes.

150
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:04,045
Are you sure you're all right?

151
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:05,316
Please, not you.

152
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:08,518
Okay. I'm just saying,
you can talk to me if you want.

153
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:10,458
I'm your little sister.

154
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:13,854
It's that new job, isn't it?

155
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:16,560
Yeah, well, I need that new job.

156
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:20,731
I can't take care of Amy and the kids
and myself on my pension.

157
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:24,105
I'm not gonna sleep on your couch
for the rest of my life.

158
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:28,840
Okay, well, maybe you get a daytime job,
a regular job.

159
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:30,677
It's not that simple.

160
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,582
Well, you should think about it.

161
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,133
Ben! What happened?

162
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:52,598
Just leave me alone.
Please, just leave me alone!

163
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:54,764
Angie, get out of here! Now!

164
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:23,759
What is happening to you, Ben?

165
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:26,667
Pull yourself together.

166
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,071
Help!

167
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:27,480
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my...

168
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:28,917
No!

169
00:27:33,918 --> 00:27:35,317
"Gary Lewis."

170
00:28:47,592 --> 00:28:48,820
Esseker.

171
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:51,718
Esseker.

172
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:18,346
Hello?

173
00:30:20,618 --> 00:30:21,949
Hello?

174
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:26,123
Where are you?

175
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:29,524
I want to help you,
but I need to know where you are!

176
00:30:29,594 --> 00:30:30,959
Damn it!

177
00:30:36,267 --> 00:30:37,632
I'm coming!

178
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:05,493
Anybody here?

179
00:31:08,132 --> 00:31:09,724
Is anybody in here?

180
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:03,286
Fuck this place.

181
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:26,770
Mom! Mom! Mom!

182
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,398
- Mom! Mom!
- Michael?

183
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:32,136
Are you okay? What's happening?

184
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:34,735
Michael. What's the matter, sweetie?

185
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:37,607
- There's a lady screaming.
- Where?

186
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:41,174
- There, in the mirror.
- In the mirror?

187
00:33:41,552 --> 00:33:43,782
I don't see anybody
but you and I in the mirror.

188
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:46,153
- You just had a nightmare, sweetie.
- Okay.

189
00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:48,522
Sometimes they can feel really real,
but they're not, all right?

190
00:33:48,593 --> 00:33:50,686
- Okay.
- Okay, let's go back to sleep.

191
00:33:50,762 --> 00:33:53,390
Come on. In you go.

192
00:33:53,464 --> 00:33:56,262
I'm right around the corner, all right?

193
00:33:56,334 --> 00:33:59,132
- Love you.
- I love you, too, sweetie.

194
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:04,708
- Can you leave the door open?
- Sure, sweetheart.

195
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:08,007
- But you go back to sleep, okay?
- All right, Mom.

196
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,842
<i>... not clear how it happened.</i>

197
00:34:09,914 --> 00:34:13,372
<i>The 42-year-old is expected to go
on trial this month for allegedly</i>

198
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:16,352
<i>sexually assaulting a former co-worker
in her apartment</i>

199
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:19,857
<i>for 13 hours on Halloween night in 2005.</i>

200
00:34:19,924 --> 00:34:23,951
<i>Braunstein's lawyer says his client
was mentally ill at the time.</i>

201
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:27,824
<i>The Feds say they'll seek the death
penalty against a former mob boss</i>

202
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,129
<i>accused of ordering a hit on a rival.</i>

203
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:32,192
<i>The trial of Vincent "Vinny Gorgeous"...</i>

204
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:57,152
I swear to you,
I could feel my flesh burning.

205
00:34:57,228 --> 00:35:00,425
I couldn't breathe.
It was like my lungs were full of smoke.

206
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:04,264
It was like a nightmare, but I was awake.
I know I was awake.

207
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:08,972
- You think I'm crazy, don't you?
- I don't know what to think.

208
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,065
I think you're just going through
a hard time in your life.

209
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:13,303
You're under a lot of stress.

210
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:16,869
You've been having those nightmares
since the shooting.

211
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:23,717
- You know it wasn't your fault.
- They're everywhere.

212
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:28,047
- What are you talking about?
- The fucking mirrors, they are everywhere,

213
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,923
in the department store,
on the corner of every street,

214
00:35:29,994 --> 00:35:32,895
in the window of every building
in this city.

215
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:34,454
I feel...

216
00:35:36,033 --> 00:35:40,367
I feel like I'm not the one
looking into the mirrors

217
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:42,770
but they're looking back at me.

218
00:35:44,408 --> 00:35:47,935
There's no one looking back at you
through the mirrors.

219
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:53,143
You're obviously... You're still conflicted
about what happened.

220
00:35:55,753 --> 00:35:58,347
Maybe you need to talk to someone.

221
00:35:58,556 --> 00:36:00,615
A professional, someone...

222
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:06,789
Mirrors are just glass and silver, Ben.
That's it.

223
00:36:06,864 --> 00:36:08,855
There's nothing behind them.

224
00:36:11,235 --> 00:36:14,068
Will you please go get some sleep, okay?

225
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:16,606
I love you.

226
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:32,620
Coming!

227
00:36:35,993 --> 00:36:37,324
Hold on!

228
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:47,464
- Mr. Carson?
- Yeah.

229
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,870
You want to sign here, please?

230
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:57,445
- You have a good day, sir.
- Thanks.

231
00:37:08,926 --> 00:37:10,223
Holy shit.

232
00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:20,987
Lorenzo, I need to talk to you.

233
00:38:21,065 --> 00:38:24,967
I just had the craziest day here.
Your ex-colleagues came to pay us a visit.

234
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:26,094
What are you talking about?

235
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:28,638
Well, you know Gary, the guy
who was working here before you?

236
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:29,764
Yeah.

237
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:33,003
Cops found him dead
in a subway station in Harlem.

238
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:36,638
I never liked him too much, but,
poor guy, he didn't deserve to go like that.

239
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:38,375
Did they happen to tell you
the cause of death?

240
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:40,314
- What?
- Did they tell you how he died?

241
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:42,215
No, no, they wouldn't tell me.

242
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:45,187
Mrs. Sapelli is waiting for me at home.
I got to go.

243
00:38:45,256 --> 00:38:47,486
By the way,
about that leak in the basement.

244
00:38:47,558 --> 00:38:51,858
They're sending someone over
to work on that, beginning of next week.

245
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:24,722
We have a white male, 50 years of age,
name unknown.

246
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:28,031
Following the completion
of the external examination,

247
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:30,659
the body was washed and lightly dried.

248
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:34,501
A Y-incision was made
from the bilateral clavicular joints

249
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:36,699
to the xiphoid process.

250
00:39:36,774 --> 00:39:39,299
- The tissue was waterlogged...
- Amy.

251
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:40,639
Yes, what is it?

252
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:44,203
There's someone in the lobby for you.
It sounds urgent.

253
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:54,019
Ben.

254
00:39:54,091 --> 00:39:55,422
What's happening?
What are you doing here?

255
00:39:55,493 --> 00:39:58,326
Thanks for seeing me.
Look, I need to ask you a favor.

256
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:01,024
- I'm in the middle of work.
- I know. Twenty minutes.

257
00:40:01,098 --> 00:40:03,293
Yesterday morning you picked up a body.

258
00:40:03,367 --> 00:40:06,427
Gary Lewis.
I just need to take a look at him.

259
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:08,201
- Who is he?
- He was a night watchman

260
00:40:08,272 --> 00:40:10,570
at the Mayflower. I replaced him.

261
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:12,108
How do you have his driver's license?

262
00:40:12,176 --> 00:40:16,169
I found his wallet in the department store.
Look, I just need to know how he died.

263
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:18,949
Why do you need to know how he died?

264
00:40:19,016 --> 00:40:21,780
Ben, you've been suspended. You're not
supposed to be doing any investigations.

265
00:40:21,852 --> 00:40:23,911
Amy, please, just listen to me.
This is serious.

266
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:26,889
There are some very strange things
happening over at the Mayflower.

267
00:40:26,957 --> 00:40:29,084
I can't explain, but it's...

268
00:40:30,227 --> 00:40:33,196
This guy Gary Lewis sent me a package
right before he died.

269
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:35,232
Thing is, I never met him before.

270
00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:38,462
Inside the package were all these articles
on the Mayflower, on the fire.

271
00:40:38,536 --> 00:40:42,165
It was like he was trying to tell me
something or warn me about something.

272
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:44,434
I need to figure this out. Please.

273
00:40:44,508 --> 00:40:48,171
Gary Lewis, Gary Lewis. There he is, B-16.

274
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:50,041
He slashed his throat.

275
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:53,447
There you go, there's your answer.
Your man committed suicide.

276
00:40:53,517 --> 00:40:58,147
And you get a lot of suicide cases
with people that slash their own throats?

277
00:40:59,056 --> 00:41:02,048
I didn't think so. Excuse me.

278
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:05,425
All I know is,
the police are still investigating this one.

279
00:41:05,496 --> 00:41:06,793
That's why we still have the body.

280
00:41:06,864 --> 00:41:09,389
What did he use to cut his throat?

281
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,298
A piece of mirror.

282
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:14,467
He probably broke the mirror into pieces

283
00:41:14,538 --> 00:41:17,200
so he'd have something
to cut himself with.

284
00:41:17,274 --> 00:41:19,105
Seven years bad luck.

285
00:41:21,045 --> 00:41:22,637
Esseker.

286
00:41:22,713 --> 00:41:24,544
Are you okay, Ben?

287
00:41:25,249 --> 00:41:26,580
I'm fine.

288
00:41:29,587 --> 00:41:31,521
I'm sorry, excuse me.

289
00:41:34,725 --> 00:41:36,659
I need to see his file.

290
00:41:36,727 --> 00:41:38,592
- What?
- I need his file.

291
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:39,686
- Ben.
- What's the problem?

292
00:41:39,763 --> 00:41:40,821
I just need to see his file.

293
00:41:40,898 --> 00:41:42,729
Calm down. You're not even
supposed to be down here,

294
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,064
and now you want to
look at somebody's file?

295
00:41:45,135 --> 00:41:46,966
Look, I'll be off then.

296
00:41:47,037 --> 00:41:49,267
Amy, you know where to find me
if you need me.

297
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,968
Yeah. Thanks, Peter. I appreciate it.

298
00:41:57,214 --> 00:42:01,048
- I want you to leave now. I'm serious, Ben.
- Amy, I'm sorry.

299
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:04,216
I can't leave here until I see that file.

300
00:42:04,722 --> 00:42:06,781
It's important, please.

301
00:42:08,158 --> 00:42:09,455
Please.

302
00:42:37,621 --> 00:42:40,784
Amy, come here and look at this picture.

303
00:42:44,461 --> 00:42:46,986
Look at the piece of mirror
that Gary Lewis is holding.

304
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:51,125
And look at it up here
in its reflected image in the other mirror.

305
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:54,033
It's full of blood.

306
00:42:54,104 --> 00:42:58,063
Yet in reality, it's perfectly clean.
Not a single drop, not a single drop on it.

307
00:42:58,142 --> 00:43:00,576
So what? It's probably the angle
from which the photograph was taken.

308
00:43:00,644 --> 00:43:02,669
What are you trying to prove?

309
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:05,579
What if the mirrors are showing us
something that's not really happening?

310
00:43:05,649 --> 00:43:08,311
- What are you talking about?
- No, just listen to me.

311
00:43:08,385 --> 00:43:13,186
What if the mirrors are reflecting
something that's beyond our reality?

312
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:15,851
What if the mirrors can actually make us
do things that we don't want to do?

313
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:17,621
Like making Gary Lewis
slit his own throat.

314
00:43:17,695 --> 00:43:21,529
Ben, listen to yourself.
You can't talk like that around here.

315
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,760
Don't you want to get reinstated?

316
00:43:23,834 --> 00:43:27,668
Amy, I'm seeing things in the mirrors
at work, bad things,

317
00:43:27,738 --> 00:43:29,968
to the point where I can feel
what they're showing me.

318
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:33,840
Ben, you're driving me fucking crazy!
I don't have time for this.

319
00:43:33,911 --> 00:43:35,037
What's wrong with you?

320
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:39,014
Do you think I'm making this up?
Do you think I'm fucking lying?

321
00:43:41,485 --> 00:43:44,818
What medication are you taking
to stop drinking?

322
00:44:01,438 --> 00:44:03,303
That's a strong drug.

323
00:44:03,874 --> 00:44:08,402
It has a lot of serious side effects.
How many pills are you taking a day?

324
00:44:11,915 --> 00:44:14,281
I'm sorry that I bothered you.

325
00:44:15,052 --> 00:44:16,485
You're right.

326
00:44:17,755 --> 00:44:19,780
Thanks for trying to help.

327
00:46:27,985 --> 00:46:30,078
...night at this bar.
It's a couple of blocks from here.

328
00:46:30,154 --> 00:46:32,315
- All right. Where's the body?
- Calm down.

329
00:46:32,389 --> 00:46:35,051
- I can't. How am I gonna calm down?
- Let the detective by. Step over here.

330
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:38,026
And there's a guy been living with her
at her place. There's a guy.

331
00:46:38,095 --> 00:46:41,656
All right. You say she works at this bar?
At night?

332
00:46:41,732 --> 00:46:43,723
Yeah, she works nights. She goes nights.

333
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:46,133
She comes home late.
I don't see her come home.

334
00:46:46,203 --> 00:46:47,727
She probably closes the bar, right?

335
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:51,366
Yeah. 'Cause she sleeps during the day,
like early morning hours.

336
00:46:51,441 --> 00:46:52,806
All right.

337
00:47:18,535 --> 00:47:23,131
I saw blood falling from the ceiling.
Then she call me.

338
00:47:23,207 --> 00:47:26,574
I want you to ask her,
did she hear any noises, any sounds?

339
00:47:26,643 --> 00:47:27,837
- What's going on?
- One second.

340
00:47:27,911 --> 00:47:30,607
It's all right, I live in apartment eight.
I used to be a cop.

341
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:33,241
- Just tell me what's going on.
- Just a second.

342
00:47:33,317 --> 00:47:36,377
I want to talk to the lead detective!
Angela!

343
00:47:36,453 --> 00:47:39,479
- Who is the lead detective?
- Ben.

344
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:42,654
Larry, what the hell are you doing here?

345
00:47:43,393 --> 00:47:46,954
- Larry, just tell me what's going on.
- Ben, it's not good.

346
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:48,657
Where's Angie?

347
00:47:50,434 --> 00:47:53,528
Where the fuck is my sister?
Tell them to let go of me!

348
00:47:53,604 --> 00:47:56,004
- I can't do that, Ben!
- God damn it!

349
00:48:39,616 --> 00:48:42,449
<i>The water has obliterated
most of the marks.</i>

350
00:48:42,719 --> 00:48:45,552
No sign of struggle or forced entry.

351
00:48:46,056 --> 00:48:49,457
And the front door was locked,
which means that

352
00:48:49,526 --> 00:48:51,619
the person who did this
either had keys to the apartment

353
00:48:51,695 --> 00:48:53,925
or it was someone that she knew.

354
00:48:53,997 --> 00:48:56,693
He would've never laid a finger on her.

355
00:48:57,467 --> 00:49:01,164
You know, when their father died,
Ben took care of Angela.

356
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:04,665
She meant the world to him.

357
00:49:04,741 --> 00:49:08,700
Listen, so far, his statement is pretty
consistent with the facts, you know?

358
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:11,771
We checked it out.
He showed up to work at 7:00 p.m.

359
00:49:11,848 --> 00:49:13,076
And the downstairs neighbors said

360
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:16,347
they began to notice the water leakage
at around 10:00.

361
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:19,480
The only strange thing,
and this could just be a coincidence,

362
00:49:19,556 --> 00:49:23,492
is that Ben told the daytime
security guard, Lorenzo Sapelli,

363
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:26,324
that he was planning on quitting the job.

364
00:49:26,396 --> 00:49:31,060
Like he was moving away someplace.
He mention anything like that to you?

365
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:32,294
No.

366
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:36,970
Lately, communication hasn't been
our strong point.

367
00:49:37,574 --> 00:49:38,802
What are you gonna do with him?

368
00:49:38,875 --> 00:49:40,866
I figure we'll let him go.
We got no reason to keep him here.

369
00:49:40,944 --> 00:49:42,275
Larry.

370
00:49:55,125 --> 00:49:56,786
I'm so sorry.

371
00:49:58,362 --> 00:49:59,886
Ben?

372
00:49:59,963 --> 00:50:02,898
Why don't you come home
and spend some days with the kids?

373
00:50:02,966 --> 00:50:04,490
I can't.

374
00:50:05,302 --> 00:50:08,271
I don't want to put our children in danger.

375
00:50:09,306 --> 00:50:11,866
She asked me to quit, but I wouldn't.

376
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:17,044
- They came after her.
- What are you talking about?

377
00:50:19,916 --> 00:50:22,612
I've got some things I need to take care of.

378
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:25,814
- Wait, Ben. Please.
- Amy. Amy, let me go.

379
00:50:25,889 --> 00:50:27,379
I don't want you
to get in any more trouble.

380
00:50:27,457 --> 00:50:30,984
- Please stay out of it.
- I know who did this.

381
00:50:31,061 --> 00:50:34,622
Well, in that case,
you've got to tell Larry everything.

382
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,191
He'll never believe me.

383
00:50:40,904 --> 00:50:42,565
Neither will you.

384
00:52:04,721 --> 00:52:06,746
What do you want?

385
00:52:06,823 --> 00:52:08,688
Please, just tell me.

386
00:52:09,392 --> 00:52:11,622
What do you want from me?

387
00:52:16,533 --> 00:52:19,001
What do you want from me?

388
00:52:39,523 --> 00:52:41,548
"Esseker."

389
00:52:46,363 --> 00:52:50,060
Hey. I need you to run a name for me.
Esseker.

390
00:52:50,133 --> 00:52:55,002
Echo, Sierra, Sierra, Echo,
Kilo, Echo, Romeo.

391
00:52:55,071 --> 00:52:58,563
<i>- Did you check online?
- I've already done that.</i>

392
00:52:58,642 --> 00:53:01,202
Nothing. IRS and DMV.

393
00:53:01,278 --> 00:53:03,143
<i>- Where?
- Try New York.</i>

394
00:53:03,213 --> 00:53:04,840
<i>- When?
- Last five or six years.</i>

395
00:53:04,915 --> 00:53:06,246
<i>Okay, Ben.</i>

396
00:53:06,316 --> 00:53:08,841
Thanks.
Get back to me as soon as you can.

397
00:53:10,654 --> 00:53:13,521
"Mayflower burns, 48 presumed dead."

398
00:53:15,725 --> 00:53:18,523
"Berry confesses to
deadly Mayflower fire."

399
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:25,801
"Watchman arrested."

400
00:53:27,938 --> 00:53:31,738
"Woman, three children murdered."
Come on, Ben, connect the dots.

401
00:53:31,808 --> 00:53:34,072
"Mr. Berry maintains that
the mirrors in the store are the ones

402
00:53:34,144 --> 00:53:37,307
"that brutally killed his wife
and three children."

403
00:53:41,651 --> 00:53:44,381
"Mirrors are guilty. Mirrors are guilty."

404
00:53:45,088 --> 00:53:47,579
<i>- Yeah. What did you get?
- Hey.</i>

405
00:53:47,657 --> 00:53:50,490
<i>Look, I didn't find anything
under that name.</i>

406
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:53,154
Shit! Shit.

407
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:55,790
<i>Do you want me
to look outside New York?</i>

408
00:53:55,865 --> 00:53:58,459
No. Hold on. Hold on.

409
00:54:02,372 --> 00:54:05,933
I want you to run another name for me.
Berry, Terrence Berry.

410
00:54:06,009 --> 00:54:08,477
<i>Terrence Berry.</i>

411
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:10,640
<i>Wait one sec.</i>

412
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:17,375
<i>- I think I got him. You still there?
- Yeah.</i>

413
00:54:18,188 --> 00:54:21,646
<i>- Your guy murdered his whole family.
- I already know that.</i>

414
00:54:21,725 --> 00:54:23,124
<i>He's dead.</i>

415
00:54:24,661 --> 00:54:25,992
Damn it.

416
00:54:27,731 --> 00:54:30,564
Can you tell me where he was committed
before he died?

417
00:54:33,503 --> 00:54:36,802
You know, Mr. Carson, when one
starts to perceive one's own reflection

418
00:54:36,873 --> 00:54:38,738
as a completely separate being,

419
00:54:38,808 --> 00:54:42,005
one is suddenly confronted
with two entirely separate egos,

420
00:54:42,078 --> 00:54:45,775
two entirely separate worlds
that can surface at any given moment.

421
00:54:45,849 --> 00:54:49,148
A feeling of self-hatred,
usually triggered by a psychological shock

422
00:54:49,219 --> 00:54:51,050
can split the personality in two.

423
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:54,420
Hence creating two or more personalities
with distinct memories

424
00:54:54,491 --> 00:54:58,086
and distinct behavior patterns
within the same individual.

425
00:54:58,161 --> 00:55:02,564
The patient then has
the false perception of the existence

426
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:06,898
of two distinct worlds, the real world
and the world inside a mirror.

427
00:55:11,741 --> 00:55:14,403
These recordings were used
in Terrence's trial.

428
00:55:17,714 --> 00:55:19,579
You'll see they speak for themselves.

429
00:55:23,887 --> 00:55:25,821
<i>Why did you set
the department store on fire?</i>

430
00:55:25,889 --> 00:55:29,052
<i>In order to destroy the mirrors.</i>

431
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:34,555
<i>Only fire can destroy mirrors,
isn't that right, Doctor?</i>

432
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:40,159
<i>What made you think you absolutely
had to destroy those mirrors, Terrence?</i>

433
00:55:43,807 --> 00:55:48,744
<i>They killed my Helen
and my three children.</i>

434
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:50,911
<i>For what reason?</i>

435
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:52,379
<i>Why would mirrors
want to kill your family?</i>

436
00:55:52,449 --> 00:55:55,145
<i>- Because I didn't...
- Didn't do what?</i>

437
00:55:57,587 --> 00:55:59,316
<i>They asked me to find Esseker.</i>

438
00:55:59,389 --> 00:56:00,413
Oh, my God.

439
00:56:00,490 --> 00:56:02,287
<i>We all are looking for Esseker.</i>

440
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:04,054
Amy.

441
00:56:04,127 --> 00:56:06,186
Excuse me, I have to go.

442
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:12,160
<i>Tell me about Esseker, Terrence.
Who is Esseker?</i>

443
00:56:12,235 --> 00:56:14,897
<i>I don't know who Esseker is!</i>

444
00:56:15,939 --> 00:56:18,601
<i>I don't know who Esseker is!</i>

445
00:56:20,243 --> 00:56:21,540
<i>I don't know.</i>

446
00:56:29,853 --> 00:56:31,980
Mrs. Carson? It's Rosa.

447
00:56:32,655 --> 00:56:37,524
Mr. Ben is here.
He's moving all of the furniture around.

448
00:57:10,794 --> 00:57:13,558
- Hey. How was school today?
- Good.

449
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:15,894
Good. I'll be right back.

450
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:28,534
Dad...

451
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:32,240
Sweetheart, just give me a second.
I gotta take care of a couple of things.

452
00:57:54,771 --> 00:57:56,864
Daddy, what are you doing?

453
00:57:59,742 --> 00:58:02,040
Honey, don't look scared.
Everything's fine.

454
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:05,012
I think it looks nicer like this. Don't you?

455
00:58:21,464 --> 00:58:23,557
Rosa, what's happening?

456
00:58:23,867 --> 00:58:27,064
Take the kids downstairs, right now.
Right now.

457
00:58:27,604 --> 00:58:28,696
What the hell are you doing?

458
00:58:28,771 --> 00:58:30,966
Amy, you're gonna have to trust me.
This is for your own protection.

459
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:33,406
Get out of the house, right now!

460
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:36,570
Hey, are you listening to me?
You are scaring the kids!

461
00:58:36,646 --> 00:58:38,136
If you don't leave immediately,
I'm calling the police,

462
00:58:38,214 --> 00:58:40,182
and I warn you,
you will never see your kids again!

463
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:42,616
Amy, I am not crazy.
These mirrors are dangerous.

464
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:45,677
At first I thought it was just the ones
in the store, but after Angela was killed,

465
00:58:45,755 --> 00:58:47,052
I realized they can get at you anywhere.

466
00:58:47,123 --> 00:58:51,059
I promise I will leave the house.
Just let me cover these damn mirrors.

467
00:58:51,127 --> 00:58:53,061
What's wrong with you?

468
00:58:54,264 --> 00:58:56,357
I know what you've been going through
hasn't been easy.

469
00:58:56,432 --> 00:59:00,027
But guess what?
It hasn't been easy for us, either!

470
00:59:00,103 --> 00:59:03,095
Angela was a part of our lives, too,
you know that?

471
00:59:03,172 --> 00:59:06,005
It's not fair what you're doing to us, Ben!

472
00:59:06,075 --> 00:59:09,841
Michael... He's acting so strange now.

473
00:59:09,913 --> 00:59:13,940
He always wants to be alone. He won't
talk to me. He's having nightmares.

474
00:59:14,017 --> 00:59:16,884
Ben, your behavior is rubbing off on him!

475
00:59:16,953 --> 00:59:19,888
He is six years old. I have to protect him!

476
00:59:20,123 --> 00:59:22,353
I want to show you something.

477
00:59:25,161 --> 00:59:26,753
- Ben, let go of me!
- You don't want to believe me?

478
00:59:26,829 --> 00:59:27,853
Fine, I'll show you.

479
00:59:27,931 --> 00:59:30,422
- What are you doing?
- I'll show you!

480
00:59:32,035 --> 00:59:33,525
Are you crazy?

481
00:59:35,838 --> 00:59:37,999
- Have you gone completely mad?
- Just wait, you'll see.

482
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:39,939
- See what?
- You'll see.

483
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:43,569
See what, Ben?
What am I supposed to see?

484
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:53,351
It's not happening.

485
00:59:54,390 --> 00:59:56,187
It's not happening.

486
00:59:56,392 --> 00:59:59,190
Amy, I swear to you, at the Mayflower...

487
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:04,130
I am not lying.

488
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:23,043
Ben. Let's go back inside, okay?

489
01:00:26,589 --> 01:00:28,420
Put the gun away.

490
01:00:30,526 --> 01:00:33,962
Listen to me, baby. I want to help you.

491
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:36,057
Tell the kids I'm sorry.

492
01:00:36,132 --> 01:00:37,360
Ben!

493
01:01:09,465 --> 01:01:10,523
No!

494
01:04:58,327 --> 01:04:59,885
Jesus Christ.

495
01:05:53,049 --> 01:05:55,074
Larry, it's me. I need your help again.

496
01:05:55,151 --> 01:05:58,712
I'm trying to locate the patient-employee
manifest for St. Matthew's Hospital.

497
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:00,050
<i>Where is it?</i>

498
01:06:00,122 --> 01:06:02,317
Where was it? They closed it down.

499
01:06:02,391 --> 01:06:04,586
But it was in New York.
It's where the Mayflower used to be.

500
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:06,753
<i>The Mayflower? The department store?</i>

501
01:06:06,829 --> 01:06:09,127
Do you have any idea where
they would store records for a hospital

502
01:06:09,198 --> 01:06:11,393
that's been closed for over 50 years?

503
01:06:11,467 --> 01:06:13,935
<i>No, I don't. But I can send someone
to city hall to check it out.</i>

504
01:06:14,003 --> 01:06:17,939
<i>If it's a public hospital, there'd be a record
of it. Tell me exactly what you need.</i>

505
01:06:18,007 --> 01:06:21,636
Same thing. I'm looking for a patient
or an employee with the name Esseker.

506
01:06:21,711 --> 01:06:26,307
<i>All right, I'm on it. Give me a couple hours,
and, Ben, keep your head down.</i>

507
01:06:49,205 --> 01:06:50,229
Hey.

508
01:06:50,306 --> 01:06:52,774
- Did you get it?
- Yeah, I think so.

509
01:06:53,576 --> 01:06:56,602
It's Anna Esseker.

510
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:00,544
I didn't really know what you wanted,
so I got all the medical files.

511
01:07:00,616 --> 01:07:03,676
This is perfect, Larry. This is perfect.

512
01:07:03,753 --> 01:07:06,620
What happened?
Did you get in an accident?

513
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:08,884
Anna Esseker's file,
did you have to go to city hall for it?

514
01:07:08,958 --> 01:07:10,357
No, I didn't have to go anywhere.

515
01:07:10,426 --> 01:07:13,395
All the files in that place were in storage
with the cold-case evidence.

516
01:07:13,462 --> 01:07:14,622
Why, because of the fire?

517
01:07:14,697 --> 01:07:18,360
No, it's before the fire.
It's a totally different case.

518
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:20,696
Anna was a patient at St. Matthew's.

519
01:07:20,770 --> 01:07:23,398
She was in the psych ward
run by a Dr. Kane.

520
01:07:23,472 --> 01:07:26,600
Now get this,
she was only 12 years old when she died.

521
01:07:26,675 --> 01:07:27,664
What?

522
01:07:27,743 --> 01:07:31,702
When the nurses went on their rounds
first thing in the morning, October 6, 1952,

523
01:07:31,781 --> 01:07:34,773
they discovered that all the patients
had left their rooms during the night,

524
01:07:34,850 --> 01:07:36,841
and they'd all gathered in the main hall.

525
01:07:36,919 --> 01:07:39,513
Ben, they were all dead, including the girl.

526
01:07:39,588 --> 01:07:43,080
Apparently, they killed each other.
I mean, it was a slaughterhouse.

527
01:07:43,159 --> 01:07:45,525
That's when they closed the place down.
Who knows what really happened?

528
01:07:45,594 --> 01:07:47,960
- What about the doctor? Kane?
- Well, they arrested him.

529
01:07:48,030 --> 01:07:49,895
They found him dead
first day of the hearing.

530
01:07:49,965 --> 01:07:53,423
He slashed his wrists
with a piece of the cell mirror.

531
01:07:54,703 --> 01:07:57,365
- Thanks for your help.
- Good luck.

532
01:08:03,612 --> 01:08:04,840
Damn it!

533
01:08:41,717 --> 01:08:43,014
Jesus.

534
01:08:59,235 --> 01:09:00,896
"October 6, 1952."

535
01:09:05,374 --> 01:09:08,901
"Anna Esseker is diagnosed with
severe schizophrenia,

536
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:13,278
"leading to withdrawal from reality,
delusional and violent behavior."

537
01:09:24,126 --> 01:09:26,754
"Pennsylvania, August 1951."

538
01:09:45,481 --> 01:09:46,948
They don't match.

539
01:09:49,185 --> 01:09:53,315
Anna Esseker was discharged
from St. Matthew's Hospital October 4.

540
01:09:53,389 --> 01:09:55,550
Two days before the massacre.

541
01:10:17,813 --> 01:10:20,043
She's alive, isn't she?

542
01:10:34,630 --> 01:10:37,997
You almost done, sweetie? Okay.

543
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:42,504
Why is Daddy acting so scared?
It's not normal.

544
01:10:44,073 --> 01:10:46,871
He's way older than me.

545
01:10:47,443 --> 01:10:51,004
And I'm not acting scared, but he is.

546
01:10:52,281 --> 01:10:56,911
- Doesn't make any sense.
- Michael? What are you doing?

547
01:10:57,987 --> 01:10:59,181
Nothing.

548
01:11:00,022 --> 01:11:03,685
- Okay, well, we gotta get going, all right?
- Okay.

549
01:11:36,792 --> 01:11:39,283
<i>- Amy? Amy, what's wrong?
- Ben.</i>

550
01:11:39,361 --> 01:11:42,194
You have to come
to the house right now.

551
01:11:42,264 --> 01:11:43,856
I'm so scared.

552
01:11:43,932 --> 01:11:46,833
<i>- Amy, what's wrong?
- I'm so scared.</i>

553
01:11:46,902 --> 01:11:50,133
<i>- Amy, just tell me what happened.
- There's something in the house.</i>

554
01:11:51,707 --> 01:11:54,335
<i>- Something in the mirrors.
- I'm on my way.</i>

555
01:11:54,977 --> 01:11:56,467
God damn it!

556
01:12:02,918 --> 01:12:04,146
Come on.

557
01:12:54,870 --> 01:13:00,502
- Dad? When are you coming back home?
- Really soon, sweetheart. Come here.

558
01:13:03,812 --> 01:13:06,508
- I love you, Daddy.
- I love you, too, sweetheart.

559
01:13:06,582 --> 01:13:08,140
I gotta go.

560
01:13:08,650 --> 01:13:10,447
I'm afraid to stay here.

561
01:13:10,519 --> 01:13:12,487
There's gonna be windows and mirrors
wherever you go.

562
01:13:12,554 --> 01:13:14,988
Anything that causes a reflection
right now is dangerous.

563
01:13:15,057 --> 01:13:17,082
At least inside the house
we've covered everything.

564
01:13:17,159 --> 01:13:19,320
It's the safest place to be.

565
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:21,355
Amy, I'm so sorry.

566
01:13:21,497 --> 01:13:24,955
No. It's not your fault.
I should've believed you.

567
01:13:26,702 --> 01:13:28,033
Come here.

568
01:13:31,974 --> 01:13:35,000
Ben, you do whatever it takes to end this.

569
01:13:36,178 --> 01:13:38,612
- You hear me?
- I will.

570
01:13:40,616 --> 01:13:42,413
I'll be right back.

571
01:15:38,066 --> 01:15:39,624
Jesus.

572
01:15:41,670 --> 01:15:43,194
Yes, sir?

573
01:15:43,272 --> 01:15:46,764
Excuse me. Is this the Esseker farm?

574
01:15:46,842 --> 01:15:49,538
- What is it, Jimmy?
- I don't know, Ma.

575
01:15:50,112 --> 01:15:54,276
- What can I do for you, sir?
- I'm looking for Anna. Anna Esseker.

576
01:15:54,983 --> 01:15:57,611
There's a man looking for...
You said Anna?

577
01:15:57,686 --> 01:15:59,313
Yes, Anna Esseker.

578
01:15:59,388 --> 01:16:01,322
An Anna Esseker, Ma.

579
01:16:03,091 --> 01:16:06,925
Look, I'm sorry to bother you.
I must have the wrong place.

580
01:16:08,430 --> 01:16:09,761
What is it you want with Anna Esseker?

581
01:16:17,673 --> 01:16:20,506
I'm doing a research paper
on schizophrenia.

582
01:16:20,576 --> 01:16:23,170
I became familiar with
Anna Esseker's case.

583
01:16:23,245 --> 01:16:25,577
I just wanted to ask her some questions.

584
01:16:27,015 --> 01:16:30,781
Go tell Grandpa there's a man here
who's asking about his sister.

585
01:16:30,852 --> 01:16:32,046
Okay.

586
01:16:32,688 --> 01:16:34,155
Thank you.

587
01:16:34,222 --> 01:16:35,519
Grandpa?

588
01:16:37,159 --> 01:16:39,354
You know, up to this day,

589
01:16:39,428 --> 01:16:42,829
visions of Anna's fits
still haunt me at night.

590
01:16:44,299 --> 01:16:49,202
I helped my father fix up this part
of the basement especially for her.

591
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:53,308
Her fits were too violent.

592
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:56,276
<i>My mother couldn't
take her screams anymore.</i>

593
01:17:04,486 --> 01:17:09,947
We had every priest, doctor, healer,
coming in from all over the county,

594
01:17:10,025 --> 01:17:11,993
but no one could help her.

595
01:17:25,540 --> 01:17:32,378
So finally, a Dr. Kane from New York
answered my parents' cries for help.

596
01:17:34,583 --> 01:17:38,519
He rejected the idea of demonic
possession, said he didn't believe in it.

597
01:17:38,587 --> 01:17:43,217
He was convinced Anna suffered from
a rare form of personality disorder

598
01:17:44,393 --> 01:17:46,759
and mirrors could help her.

599
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:51,155
He wanted Anna under his care,
at St. Matthew's.

600
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:54,327
My parents were very poor,

601
01:17:54,403 --> 01:17:57,804
but he agreed to cover all the costs
of the hospital.

602
01:17:58,340 --> 01:18:00,433
Where did she go after the hospital?

603
01:18:00,509 --> 01:18:01,908
Don't you know?

604
01:18:01,977 --> 01:18:04,605
She died there
with all of Kane's other patients.

605
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:07,114
Mr. Esseker, I read the file.

606
01:18:07,182 --> 01:18:09,912
Anna left the hospital
two days before the massacre.

607
01:18:09,985 --> 01:18:13,477
Dr. Kane altered the documents
so she could disappear.

608
01:18:15,624 --> 01:18:17,148
Where did you get that document?

609
01:18:17,225 --> 01:18:20,683
I need you to tell me where she went
after St. Matthew's.

610
01:18:21,396 --> 01:18:23,762
She came back
and stayed with us for a while.

611
01:18:23,832 --> 01:18:28,098
What do you mean for a while?
What happened? Why did she leave?

612
01:18:28,170 --> 01:18:30,934
- I don't want to talk about that.
- Why did she leave?

613
01:18:32,441 --> 01:18:35,171
Because strange things
started to happen in the house.

614
01:18:35,243 --> 01:18:36,267
With Anna?

615
01:18:36,344 --> 01:18:39,802
No, no, not with Anna anymore.
No, she was totally cured.

616
01:18:41,850 --> 01:18:45,377
Strange things started to happen
with the mirrors, didn't they?

617
01:18:45,454 --> 01:18:48,753
Mr. Esseker, I need to know where Anna
is now. It's a matter of life and death.

618
01:18:48,824 --> 01:18:51,156
Do not make me threaten you.

619
01:18:51,226 --> 01:18:56,220
We sent her somewhere
where mirrors are forbidden.

620
01:18:57,299 --> 01:19:01,167
- Where the mirrors couldn't find her.
- Where? Where?

621
01:19:02,337 --> 01:19:05,704
St. Augustine's Monastery,
on the road to Reedfield.

622
01:20:08,303 --> 01:20:09,998
How can I help you?

623
01:20:11,439 --> 01:20:12,963
I'm sorry to disturb you, Sister,

624
01:20:13,041 --> 01:20:17,307
but I've come to speak with a member
of your community. Anna Esseker.

625
01:20:17,712 --> 01:20:19,771
Is she expecting you?

626
01:20:20,048 --> 01:20:21,345
No, not really.

627
01:20:21,416 --> 01:20:24,283
If you're not listed, I cannot help you, sir.

628
01:20:24,352 --> 01:20:28,448
Can you at least tell her
that I've come from New York

629
01:20:29,024 --> 01:20:30,548
to speak with her?

630
01:20:30,625 --> 01:20:33,890
I work with Dr. Kane
from St. Matthew's Hospital.

631
01:20:34,763 --> 01:20:36,958
It's very important, please.

632
01:20:42,871 --> 01:20:47,103
St. Matthew's closed down in 1952.
Who are you?

633
01:20:47,175 --> 01:20:49,336
My name is Benjamin Carson.

634
01:20:49,778 --> 01:20:53,578
I work as a night watchman
on Sixth Avenue in New York City

635
01:20:53,648 --> 01:20:56,947
in the building that used to be
St. Matthew's Hospital.

636
01:20:57,018 --> 01:20:59,578
What is it you want, Mr. Carson?

637
01:20:59,988 --> 01:21:01,853
My family is in danger,

638
01:21:01,923 --> 01:21:04,551
and what's threatening them
is asking for you.

639
01:21:04,626 --> 01:21:08,824
I came all this way to ask you

640
01:21:08,897 --> 01:21:11,127
why the mirrors that were left over
from St. Matthew's Hospital

641
01:21:11,199 --> 01:21:13,463
are so desperate to find you.

642
01:21:14,769 --> 01:21:16,498
Please, Miss Esseker.

643
01:21:17,138 --> 01:21:18,901
If you don't help me,

644
01:21:18,974 --> 01:21:21,306
I'm gonna lose the most important thing
to me in this world,

645
01:21:21,376 --> 01:21:23,071
and that's my family.

646
01:21:26,715 --> 01:21:28,649
Sit down, Mr. Carson.

647
01:21:37,726 --> 01:21:40,695
The mirrors are merely windows
on our world.

648
01:21:41,963 --> 01:21:44,830
It is not the wish of the mirrors to find me

649
01:21:45,901 --> 01:21:48,836
but of what is imprisoned inside them.

650
01:21:48,904 --> 01:21:50,997
What is imprisoned inside them?

651
01:21:52,374 --> 01:21:55,901
At the time that I was at St. Matthew's,

652
01:21:56,912 --> 01:22:00,507
<i>Dr. Kane's therapy
for personality disorders</i>

653
01:22:00,582 --> 01:22:05,451
<i>consisted of locking the patient up
in a mirrored room</i>

654
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:11,686
<i>for several days on end,
forcing them to confront their own image.</i>

655
01:22:13,929 --> 01:22:17,160
<i>Dr. Kane was wrong about his theory.</i>

656
01:22:17,666 --> 01:22:21,363
<i>There is no cure for schizophrenia,
Mr. Carson.</i>

657
01:22:24,472 --> 01:22:26,906
It was something else.

658
01:22:27,575 --> 01:22:33,639
<i>And whatever it was,
it left me and entered the mirrors.</i>

659
01:22:35,517 --> 01:22:36,916
Since that day,

660
01:22:36,985 --> 01:22:40,580
it has been collecting
the souls of the people it kills.

661
01:22:41,623 --> 01:22:43,784
I'm sorry,

662
01:22:43,858 --> 01:22:47,191
but if I agree to go with you
and return back to that place,

663
01:22:47,262 --> 01:22:48,991
I will make it possible for the demon

664
01:22:49,064 --> 01:22:51,931
to cross the threshold
back into the real world.

665
01:22:52,033 --> 01:22:54,558
Do you understand
what that means for my family?

666
01:22:54,636 --> 01:22:57,764
You can't do this.
You need to come back with me.

667
01:22:58,606 --> 01:23:01,575
I'm going to pray for you and your family.

668
01:23:01,643 --> 01:23:05,204
That's all I can do right now, Mr. Carson.
I'm sorry.

669
01:23:06,781 --> 01:23:08,476
God bless you.

670
01:23:09,684 --> 01:23:14,917
Gary Lewis, Terrence Berry and many
other men have died trying to find you.

671
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:17,185
And because they failed,
their families died, too.

672
01:23:17,258 --> 01:23:19,886
Two days ago my sister was murdered.

673
01:23:20,528 --> 01:23:23,554
My family will be next
if you don't help me.

674
01:23:23,999 --> 01:23:25,364
Please.

675
01:23:25,433 --> 01:23:28,664
Please. Wait, wait.

676
01:23:32,273 --> 01:23:33,706
This is my family.

677
01:23:33,775 --> 01:23:35,675
This is my wife Amy

678
01:23:35,744 --> 01:23:38,508
and my daughter Daisy
and my son Michael.

679
01:23:39,314 --> 01:23:41,009
They're beautiful.

680
01:23:41,483 --> 01:23:44,509
They're innocent.
They've never hurt anybody.

681
01:23:46,621 --> 01:23:48,054
Please.

682
01:23:48,390 --> 01:23:49,880
Take the photo.

683
01:23:51,393 --> 01:23:53,122
Just take the photo.

684
01:24:02,170 --> 01:24:03,660
Look at them.

685
01:24:06,674 --> 01:24:08,141
I'm sorry.

686
01:24:10,645 --> 01:24:13,113
Who the hell do you think you are?

687
01:24:13,381 --> 01:24:15,178
They're just kids!

688
01:24:53,288 --> 01:24:54,687
<i>- Hello?
- Amy.</i>

689
01:24:54,756 --> 01:24:57,350
<i>- Ben, where are you?
- At the monastery.</i>

690
01:24:57,826 --> 01:24:59,657
<i>- Did you find her?
- Yes.</i>

691
01:24:59,727 --> 01:25:01,752
Yeah? Did you talk to...

692
01:25:02,397 --> 01:25:04,524
<i>- Amy?
- Michael?</i>

693
01:25:06,201 --> 01:25:07,600
Michael?

694
01:25:07,836 --> 01:25:09,997
<i>Ben, hold on, Michael's gone.</i>

695
01:25:10,071 --> 01:25:11,333
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.

696
01:25:11,406 --> 01:25:13,806
I fell asleep with the kids on the bed
and now I don't know where he is.

697
01:25:13,875 --> 01:25:14,933
<i>Michael?</i>

698
01:25:15,009 --> 01:25:16,408
Amy, what's going on?
Is everything all right?

699
01:25:17,879 --> 01:25:18,937
Oh, fuck.

700
01:25:19,681 --> 01:25:21,239
Amy, what's going on?
Have you got Michael?

701
01:25:22,684 --> 01:25:23,912
Oh, my God.

702
01:25:24,786 --> 01:25:27,414
Ben, there's water everywhere.

703
01:25:28,456 --> 01:25:29,445
Oh, my God.

704
01:25:29,557 --> 01:25:33,254
<i>You've got to be careful of the water.
It creates reflections.</i>

705
01:25:34,062 --> 01:25:36,292
Someone is in the house.

706
01:25:36,364 --> 01:25:38,059
Someone scraped all the mirrors!

707
01:25:38,133 --> 01:25:39,725
Amy, where is Michael?

708
01:25:39,801 --> 01:25:42,463
I don't know. I don't know where he is.
I don't see him anywhere.

709
01:25:42,537 --> 01:25:44,368
<i>Amy, listen to me,
you've gotta stay away from the water.</i>

710
01:25:44,439 --> 01:25:47,169
<i>Get the kids
and stay away from the water!</i>

711
01:25:47,642 --> 01:25:49,735
<i>- Michael?
- Amy?</i>

712
01:25:49,811 --> 01:25:52,109
Amy? Shit!

713
01:26:00,822 --> 01:26:03,689
Which room is she in? Which one?

714
01:26:07,929 --> 01:26:10,625
My family is not dying tonight.
You are coming with me.

715
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:26,674
Michael?

716
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:46,628
Daisy?

717
01:26:49,704 --> 01:26:51,365
Daisy, come here.

718
01:27:05,386 --> 01:27:06,944
Come here, Daisy.

719
01:27:08,289 --> 01:27:09,347
Mom?

720
01:27:15,863 --> 01:27:17,330
Come here, sweetheart.

721
01:27:37,018 --> 01:27:38,918
What are you doing in there?

722
01:27:40,855 --> 01:27:43,187
Everything's going to be all right.

723
01:27:57,405 --> 01:27:58,963
No!

724
01:28:02,343 --> 01:28:04,777
No! No!

725
01:28:04,846 --> 01:28:06,006
Daisy!

726
01:28:09,083 --> 01:28:11,142
Come here! Get down!
Get down, right now!

727
01:28:11,219 --> 01:28:14,154
Get down, sweetie. Get down.
Oh, my God, are you okay?

728
01:28:14,222 --> 01:28:17,714
Oh, my God! Stay right there.
Don't move, baby! Don't move!

729
01:28:17,792 --> 01:28:20,226
- Mom, why did you do that to me?
- It wasn't me, sweetheart.

730
01:28:20,295 --> 01:28:22,229
You know I would never hurt you.
You know that.

731
01:28:22,297 --> 01:28:24,629
Here. Hold this. Hold it tight.

732
01:28:26,067 --> 01:28:27,091
Okay?

733
01:28:29,971 --> 01:28:33,338
Here, get down, sweetie.
Let me see. Let me see.

734
01:28:35,243 --> 01:28:37,473
Let me see, sweetie. It's gonna be okay.

735
01:28:37,545 --> 01:28:40,605
All right? I know it hurts. Stay right there.

736
01:28:42,684 --> 01:28:46,120
All right. Give me your hand.
I need you to hold it really tight, okay?

737
01:28:46,187 --> 01:28:48,712
Just flat and tight, just like that. Okay.

738
01:28:48,790 --> 01:28:52,089
Now, I need you to listen to me,
okay, baby?

739
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:54,060
- You have to be very brave.
- Okay.

740
01:28:54,128 --> 01:28:55,925
I need you to stay here
no matter what happens.

741
01:28:55,997 --> 01:28:59,558
No matter what you hear. Do not move
from this closet until I come back.

742
01:28:59,634 --> 01:29:01,101
- You understand me, right?
- Yes.

743
01:29:01,169 --> 01:29:03,967
Okay. Okay.

744
01:29:04,038 --> 01:29:06,165
Do not move. I love you.

745
01:29:07,608 --> 01:29:08,734
Don't move.

746
01:29:36,504 --> 01:29:37,835
Michael?

747
01:29:55,590 --> 01:29:56,887
Michael?

748
01:30:00,061 --> 01:30:01,392
Where are you?

749
01:30:03,831 --> 01:30:05,093
Michael?

750
01:30:23,017 --> 01:30:24,279
Michael!

751
01:30:24,919 --> 01:30:27,080
Michael, what are you doing?

752
01:30:31,259 --> 01:30:35,423
Don't be scared, Mommy.
He just wants to play with us.

753
01:30:35,830 --> 01:30:39,163
Michael, I want you to drop that knife,
right now.

754
01:30:39,233 --> 01:30:40,757
Do you hear me?

755
01:30:41,836 --> 01:30:46,068
You know very well you're not allowed
to play with knives. Don't you?

756
01:30:48,176 --> 01:30:49,370
Come on.

757
01:30:52,980 --> 01:30:54,709
That's a good boy.

758
01:30:55,082 --> 01:30:57,175
Give me the knife, Michael.

759
01:30:57,785 --> 01:30:59,753
Michael! Michael!

760
01:31:02,824 --> 01:31:04,223
Michael?

761
01:31:12,266 --> 01:31:13,528
Michael!

762
01:31:14,702 --> 01:31:16,033
Michael!

763
01:31:19,740 --> 01:31:21,173
Michael?

764
01:31:22,777 --> 01:31:24,301
Michael.

765
01:31:25,680 --> 01:31:27,011
Michael?

766
01:31:27,815 --> 01:31:30,511
Why are you hiding from me, sweetheart?

767
01:31:42,163 --> 01:31:43,653
Michael?

768
01:32:36,083 --> 01:32:39,018
You okay? Come on.

769
01:33:26,033 --> 01:33:28,501
It's waiting for me downstairs.

770
01:33:37,812 --> 01:33:42,078
Bring me inside. From now on,
I have to keep my eyes closed.

771
01:33:42,883 --> 01:33:45,681
Step up. You're in the room.

772
01:33:46,220 --> 01:33:47,915
Strap me in.

773
01:33:56,897 --> 01:33:59,627
I spent the darkest days of my life
in this room.

774
01:34:02,703 --> 01:34:04,193
Are you sure there's no other way?

775
01:34:04,271 --> 01:34:06,865
This is for your family, Mr. Carson.

776
01:34:08,242 --> 01:34:09,903
For your family.

777
01:34:24,025 --> 01:34:25,390
