1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:56,264
- What are you gonna cook?
- Your favourite.

3
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:58,349
What, again?

4
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:16,534
- Well, this is the last one.
- What, you mean no more tomatoes?

5
00:01:16,611 --> 00:01:20,079
You can never have
enough tins of tomatoes, eh?

6
00:01:20,162 --> 00:01:22,623
Instead...

7
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:25,668
we've got five tins of chickpeas.

8
00:01:25,751 --> 00:01:29,297
That should last at least five year, eh?

9
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,177
- Fancy a glass of wine?
- Yeah, that'd be great.

10
00:01:41,934 --> 00:01:44,103
We're in luck.

11
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:47,857
Drinkable.

12
00:02:05,249 --> 00:02:08,961
- You all right, sweetheart?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

13
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:15,051
Well, I'm not fine, it's all fucked, but...

14
00:02:15,134 --> 00:02:19,055
- Our children are safe, aren't they?
- Totally. Yeah.

15
00:02:19,138 --> 00:02:22,558
Thank God we paid for that school trip.
Imagine if we hadn't!

16
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:25,978
I can't. I can't imagine. I can't imagine.

17
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:31,275
And I don't want to imagine. I don't...
Listen, they're far, far away.

18
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:33,402
And they're safe and sound.

19
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,571
OK?

20
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,823
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

21
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:39,033
OK.

22
00:02:39,575 --> 00:02:41,661
Don't worry...

23
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:45,748
gorgeous.

24
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:00,763
Not interrupting, am I?

25
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,060
No.

26
00:03:06,143 --> 00:03:08,521
I found this in the cellar.

27
00:03:08,604 --> 00:03:13,484
I'd forgotten all about it.
I thought we could have them after dinner.

28
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:15,278
Yeah.

29
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:35,840
- It smells wonderful.
- And is that a bottle of wine, Don?

30
00:03:35,923 --> 00:03:39,010
- It is indeed, Geoff.
- Thank you.

31
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:42,346
There's chocolate for after,
courtesy of your good wife.

32
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,892
What have we here? I get blackberries.

33
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:50,188
Vanilla. Notes of autumn.

34
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,777
Karen?

35
00:04:02,658 --> 00:04:04,785
He'll be hungry.

36
00:04:06,078 --> 00:04:09,248
When he gets back
he'll want something to eat.

37
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,459
- Here we go again.
- Jacob, no.

38
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:15,713
Let me tell you something. It's five days
since your boyfriend ran out on us.

39
00:04:15,796 --> 00:04:18,883
If he's still breathing,
he won't be interested in pasta.

40
00:04:18,966 --> 00:04:20,760
Jacob!

41
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:23,804
- It'll be your fucking neck!
- Don't say that!

42
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:26,015
- Out of order, Jacob.
- Why?

43
00:04:26,098 --> 00:04:29,560
We all know it's true.
The sooner she faces it, the better.

44
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:34,148
There are no survivors.
It's just us in here and them out there.

45
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:41,072
- Sam?
- Quiet!

46
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:45,117
- God, it's a boy.
- Wait, wait. You don't know who's out there.

47
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:49,080
- Please, let me in!
- Don, it's a kid!

48
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:52,166
Help! Let me in!

49
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,126
Bloody hell.

50
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:01,676
- Please! Please, let me in!
- We're coming.

51
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,761
Let me in!

52
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:07,640
Please! Help! Let me in!

53
00:05:07,723 --> 00:05:09,934
Please!

54
00:05:10,017 --> 00:05:13,312
Get in. Come on, get in. Come here.

55
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:30,454
- Are you all right? Are you all right?
- Yeah.

56
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:39,297
- Where have you come from?
- Sandford.

57
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,091
Sandford's upriver a few miles.

58
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:48,306
- How did you get here?
- They were chasing me. Screaming.

59
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:50,808
I was scared. I ran.

60
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:54,520
I tried other houses.
They were empty.

61
00:05:54,604 --> 00:06:00,401
I came through the woods
and I followed the river until I got here.

62
00:06:00,484 --> 00:06:02,820
- Who were chasing you?
- My mum.

63
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:05,239
My dad.

64
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:08,201
They're trying to kill me.

65
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:12,413
- There's others, too.
- How many?

66
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:16,751
- Loads.
- Sam?

67
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:24,967
- It's got me! It's got my arm!
- Karen, no!

68
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,053
Help me!

69
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:55,665
Alice! Get outta here!
Get down the escape hatch, go! Go!

70
00:06:56,207 --> 00:07:00,044
- Geoff, I can't see. I can't see!
- Hold onto my hand!

71
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,713
Die, you fucker! Die!

72
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:15,810
Come back!

73
00:07:17,144 --> 00:07:19,063
Oh, God!

74
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:25,027
Keep going. Follow Jacob.
Keep going. Sally, there's no time.

75
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,905
- We can't leave them!
- Sally, come on!

76
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,866
Go!

77
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,998
Oh, no! Shit! Fuck!

78
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:42,170
Where are you?

79
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:45,423
- Where are you?
- Alice! Alice, no! Alice!

80
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,053
Geoff, come on!

81
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:53,264
Come on!

82
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,058
Geoff!

83
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,896
Sally, give me your hand.
Give me your hand, Sally!

84
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:05,067
No! Jacob! Help me!

85
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:15,953
Alice! Alice!

86
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,336
- Where are you?
- Come on! Leave him!

87
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:25,338
- I see him there!
- Leave him!

88
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:27,590
Let go!

89
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:29,467
Quick!

90
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:33,554
Don! Help us!

91
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,269
Don!

92
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,649
Don!

93
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:46,817
Get in there!

94
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:06,045
Don!

95
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,506
Don!

96
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,094
Don!

97
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:51,132
Jacob!

98
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,676
Come on!

99
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,222
Jacob!

100
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,686
Dear God!

101
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,400
Jacob!

102
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,001
Jacob!

103
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:57,156
Oh, fuck. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

104
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,325
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

105
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,221
Welcome to London.

106
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:47,016
Hey, Doyle, you having fun down there?

107
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,560
You can kiss my ass.

108
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:53,064
This is the worst combat I ever saw.
Where's the combat?

109
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,273
I hear you.

110
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:56,692
- Give me something to shoot.
- Too easy.

111
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,946
North-east of med centre,
20th floor, three windows in.

112
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:03,991
- Fat guy jerking off in the toilet.
- Oh, bug-nuts. Him again.

113
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:06,619
I don't see him.
Where is Fester Fucknut?

114
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:09,330
His dick in his hand on the 20th floor.

115
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:13,000
Next to the fire exit.
I think he needs ajerk-off extender.

116
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:15,753
Doyle, you're the expert
in hand-to-hand combat.

117
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:17,797
- Man-to-man combat.
- Shut up.

118
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,634
- Think it might be your dad, Doyle.
- You got me.

119
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,665
Shit.

120
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:59,130
- Colonel Phillips here. What is your status?
- Good morning, Colonel.

121
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:03,259
- Morning.
- I'm watching the new arrivals disembark.

122
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,052
Yes, Major?

123
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:08,389
- It'll take all morning to process them.
- Copy.

124
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:11,934
No one told me that
we're now admitting children.

125
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,741
Just follow around to your right.

126
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:56,187
Green and brown. Interesting iris variation.

127
00:14:56,270 --> 00:15:01,484
It's usually hereditary.
Do one of your parents have the same?

128
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,736
My mother. She did.

129
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:12,620
- How old are you, Andy?
- 12.

130
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:17,875
I think that makes you
the youngest person in the country.

131
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:20,503
Well, your blood pressure is A-OK

132
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,965
and you're negative
on any serious diseases or afflictions.

133
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:26,217
I think you're OK to come in.

134
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,344
Welcome back to Britain.

135
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:34,660
We are headed for our area
of security and reconstruction

136
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:37,121
designated as District One.

137
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:40,374
District One is located on the Isle of Dogs.

138
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:46,964
Although the Isle of Dogs is completely safe,
the surrounding area of London is not.

139
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:52,261
Large numbers of bodies are still not cleared
from the original outbreak of infection.

140
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:56,307
Rats and wild dogs are prevalent,
as is disease.

141
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,727
New arrivals are reminded
for their own safety

142
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:05,149
it is absolutely forbidden to cross the river
and leave the security zone.

143
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:11,155
You will be joining 15,000 civilians
who are already resident in District One.

144
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:16,994
As we approach your new home, you'll notice
a dramatically increased military presence.

145
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:19,914
The US Army is responsible for your safety.

146
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:25,586
We will do everything we can do
to make your repatriation as easy as possible.

147
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:29,924
Inside District One, however,
we believe you'll be pleasantly surprised.

148
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:34,178
We have hot and cold running water,
24-hour electricity,

149
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:38,724
a medical centre,
a supermarket and even a pub.

150
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:45,648
We're nearly home.

151
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,800
- Dad! Dad!
- It's Dad! Come on.

152
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:39,577
- Are you excited?
- Yeah.

153
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,377
I missed you so much.

154
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:52,256
Are you all right? Are you all right?

155
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:58,054
Guys. I never thought
I'd see you again, you know that?

156
00:19:09,524 --> 00:19:12,610
Let's get something to eat.

157
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:21,994
I should have been notified
before children were brought in.

158
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:24,914
We've not established
the protocol for minors.

159
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:30,294
We have issues of disease and sanitation.
We don't fully understand the virus yet.

160
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:34,006
We understand that it did not manage
to go cross-species,

161
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:39,345
that it did not manage to go airborne and that
the last infected human died six months ago.

162
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:42,348
- We weren't here six months ago.
- Major.

163
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:50,231
- What are you afraid of?
- What if it comes back?

164
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:53,025
- It won't come back.
- What if it does?

165
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:55,820
If it comes back, we kill it.

166
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:58,447
Code Red.

167
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,834
Come on, guys.

168
00:20:11,002 --> 00:20:13,588
What about this place, then, Andy?

169
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:16,549
Yeah, it's pretty good, Dad.

170
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,895
Look at the camera.

171
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:31,272
This way. Come through.

172
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:36,485
It's 25 floors. We've got the penthouse
up there. Believe me.

173
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:39,113
ID, sir. Thank you.

174
00:20:39,197 --> 00:20:43,034
- So, what do you do here, Dad?
- What do I do? I'm a section officer.

175
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:47,872
I keep the lights on, the water running,
the heat running. See this? Look.

176
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:53,503
That says triple A - "access all areas".
That's me. I basically run the place, you know.

177
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:57,632
No. You're the caretaker really, aren't you?

178
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:02,762
No, I run the place.

179
00:21:11,354 --> 00:21:12,813
Like it?

180
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:15,942
- It's amazing!
- Even better than sunny Spain?

181
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:21,948
You ought to have seen the camps. There
were 20 in each tent and chemical toilets.

182
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:24,909
- Everything smelled of piss.
- Nice.

183
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:32,250
We'll be moving to a new house soon.
A couple of months, in fact.

184
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,669
A new house?

185
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:36,879
Yeah.

186
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:42,218
Listen, I hope you guys understand.

187
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:46,180
We're not gonna be able
to go back to our old house.

188
00:21:46,264 --> 00:21:53,062
It's outside the security zone and I don't think
I'd want to go back there, even if I could.

189
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,857
What happened, Dad? To Mum?

190
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,736
Yeah.

191
00:22:03,281 --> 00:22:05,366
Yeah.

192
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:10,705
Do you wanna sit down
and I'll tell you all about it?

193
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:26,929
Your mum and I were hiding in a house.

194
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:31,475
A wee cottage.

195
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:38,524
It was an old couple that owned it

196
00:22:40,151 --> 00:22:42,445
and they were there, too.

197
00:22:43,821 --> 00:22:45,907
Three other people.

198
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:50,119
And we were...

199
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:55,625
just trying to stay alive, I suppose.

200
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:59,921
We were doing OK for a while.
And then we were attacked.

201
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:07,345
They came in through the kitchen window.

202
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:10,890
They were really fast, you know.

203
00:23:13,226 --> 00:23:15,311
Chased us.

204
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:19,190
Chased your mum.

205
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:26,239
And we were trapped.
Trapped in the bedroom.

206
00:23:26,948 --> 00:23:27,990
Don!

207
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:32,203
And I see...

208
00:23:33,788 --> 00:23:35,873
I see them...

209
00:23:38,543 --> 00:23:41,087
biting her.

210
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:43,464
I couldn't do anything.

211
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:52,932
I tried to go back.

212
00:23:54,475 --> 00:23:56,894
She was already gone.

213
00:24:02,692 --> 00:24:04,986
She was already gone.

214
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:08,990
Was there nothing you could do?

215
00:24:11,409 --> 00:24:14,453
No, there was nothing I could do.

216
00:24:17,999 --> 00:24:20,293
I managed to get away.

217
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:25,756
Just running, running, running...

218
00:24:30,845 --> 00:24:33,764
I got to this military camp.

219
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:43,024
And you know the rest. You know I've been
in quarantine waiting for you to come back.

220
00:24:47,737 --> 00:24:50,823
We're just happy you're still alive.

221
00:25:06,631 --> 00:25:08,925
I'm sorry.

222
00:26:02,645 --> 00:26:04,730
Doyle...

223
00:26:04,814 --> 00:26:08,359
- Doyle, you bastard.
- Boy, I've never seen you get so white.

224
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:10,319
- Fuck you.
- Good morning.

225
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:14,282
Yeah, fuck outta here, man.
I'm having all good dreams.

226
00:26:14,365 --> 00:26:18,953
Sunday afternoon, clear blue skies,
I'm laying in bed with my wife...

227
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:21,956
And now I'm back in this shithole.

228
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:23,457
- I know.
- Yeah?

229
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:26,711
I had that same dream about your wife.

230
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:30,298
- Quit fucking with me.
- Get outta here.

231
00:26:30,381 --> 00:26:36,637
- All right. Next time I'm gonna shoot you.
- All right. See you later, family man.

232
00:26:41,309 --> 00:26:44,228
I told you, I'm gonna shoot you.

233
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:18,054
What's on the TV tonight?

234
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:45,850
Are you OK? Bad dream?

235
00:28:51,397 --> 00:28:55,318
I get worried I'm gonna forget
what she looks like.

236
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:57,486
You won't forget.

237
00:28:58,154 --> 00:29:01,073
I don't even have a picture of her.

238
00:29:02,116 --> 00:29:04,202
You won't forget.

239
00:29:07,705 --> 00:29:09,832
Promise?

240
00:29:09,916 --> 00:29:12,001
Yeah.

241
00:29:21,219 --> 00:29:23,888
Andy, we agreed.
You heard what they said.

242
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:28,142
It's only dogs and rats out there.
We'll get what we want and come back again.

243
00:29:28,226 --> 00:29:31,604
- We should've told Dad.
- It's fine. Trust me.

244
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:34,482
They won't even know we're gone.

245
00:30:06,597 --> 00:30:09,100
Where are you going?

246
00:30:11,686 --> 00:30:15,356
Base, come in. We have two strays
who slipped out the north gate.

247
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:19,151
- Stray dogs?
- No, puppies.

248
00:30:19,235 --> 00:30:21,612
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

249
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:23,239
Yes! Yeah!

250
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:25,700
London's mine!

251
00:30:37,128 --> 00:30:39,672
That's what we need.

252
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:42,800
Yeah, if it had keys.

253
00:30:44,719 --> 00:30:46,804
Wait here.

254
00:32:04,131 --> 00:32:06,592
Let's go.

255
00:34:05,002 --> 00:34:07,088
There you go.

256
00:34:47,086 --> 00:34:48,504
Tam!

257
00:34:52,466 --> 00:34:54,552
Tam!

258
00:34:57,930 --> 00:35:00,016
Tam?

259
00:35:05,354 --> 00:35:07,648
Tammy, are you there?

260
00:35:12,945 --> 00:35:14,030
Tam?

261
00:35:14,113 --> 00:35:15,907
Tammy!

262
00:35:16,115 --> 00:35:18,201
Tammy!

263
00:35:54,612 --> 00:35:58,908
Tammy, this is stupid.
You're not being funny.

264
00:36:24,267 --> 00:36:26,686
I knew it.

265
00:36:47,081 --> 00:36:49,667
You're hurting me!

266
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:03,639
No! No! No! No!

267
00:37:03,723 --> 00:37:05,933
No, don't go! No!

268
00:37:06,517 --> 00:37:08,186
No!

269
00:37:08,644 --> 00:37:09,687
No!

270
00:37:20,448 --> 00:37:23,201
Doyle.

271
00:37:23,284 --> 00:37:25,995
I got your puppies.

272
00:37:42,094 --> 00:37:44,222
No!

273
00:37:50,561 --> 00:37:54,023
Get off me! Get off me!

274
00:38:07,411 --> 00:38:10,665
I apologise for these precautions.

275
00:38:10,748 --> 00:38:16,045
It's standard protocol with any survivors,
though we haven't had to do it for a while.

276
00:38:16,128 --> 00:38:21,008
The last survivor we came across
was over two months ago.

277
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:28,641
Can you tell me anything
about how you managed to keep alive

278
00:38:28,724 --> 00:38:30,726
while you were gone so long?

279
00:38:34,856 --> 00:38:37,859
Do you know of any other survivors?

280
00:38:41,404 --> 00:38:43,322
OK.

281
00:38:43,406 --> 00:38:47,160
I'm just going to take a blood sample.

282
00:38:47,243 --> 00:38:49,328
It won't hurt.

283
00:38:59,046 --> 00:39:03,092
Have you come into direct contact
with the infected?

284
00:39:13,352 --> 00:39:16,063
OK.

285
00:39:24,739 --> 00:39:27,033
I want to see my children.

286
00:39:31,037 --> 00:39:33,372
Of course. Of course.

287
00:39:53,935 --> 00:39:55,269
- Mr Harris.
- Yeah.

288
00:39:55,353 --> 00:39:59,482
- We've found your kids.
- Oh, thank God. Thank you so much.

289
00:39:59,565 --> 00:40:01,859
We found your wife, too.

290
00:40:13,246 --> 00:40:15,915
Can they hear me?

291
00:40:15,998 --> 00:40:19,961
- So, what do you two think you're playing at?
- You said you saw her die.

292
00:40:20,044 --> 00:40:22,630
- What?
- You said you saw her die!

293
00:40:26,259 --> 00:40:28,469
- I didn't say that.
- You did. You did.

294
00:40:28,553 --> 00:40:31,138
Baby, I didn't use those words.

295
00:40:31,222 --> 00:40:34,767
This is... I don't know.
I mean, it's confusing, you know.

296
00:40:34,851 --> 00:40:38,688
It's... it's very hard
for you to imagine, you know?

297
00:40:38,771 --> 00:40:42,692
- I... It's too hard to explain.
- Well, try to explain it, Dad! Try!

298
00:40:42,775 --> 00:40:47,488
Try? What do you want me to say?
I thought I saw Mum... die.

299
00:40:47,572 --> 00:40:51,117
Or I wouldn't have told you that.
I was sure.

300
00:40:53,369 --> 00:40:57,832
Look, guys, I'm not sure
what's happening here...

301
00:40:57,915 --> 00:41:00,334
but it's good. OK?

302
00:41:00,418 --> 00:41:03,212
That's the point. Mum's alive.

303
00:41:03,296 --> 00:41:05,590
I want to see her!

304
00:41:42,376 --> 00:41:45,213
There's no question, sir.

305
00:41:45,296 --> 00:41:47,548
She has the virus. She's infected.

306
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:52,428
Why isn't she showing any symptoms?

307
00:41:53,095 --> 00:41:54,972
- I don't know.
- Speculate.

308
00:41:59,685 --> 00:42:03,773
A genetic abnormality which acts
as some sort of natural immunity?

309
00:42:03,856 --> 00:42:09,946
But the virus is still in her blood and saliva,
so technically she's not immune.

310
00:42:10,029 --> 00:42:12,240
She's a carrier.

311
00:42:12,323 --> 00:42:15,034
She has the ability to infect others?

312
00:42:15,117 --> 00:42:17,203
Yes, sir. Absolutely.

313
00:42:21,249 --> 00:42:24,794
If this woman has natural immunity
she is incredibly valuable.

314
00:42:24,877 --> 00:42:30,174
Her blood could contain
the key to a vaccine, even a cure.

315
00:42:37,807 --> 00:42:40,226
Alice.

316
00:42:44,689 --> 00:42:46,774
Hey, baby.

317
00:42:49,986 --> 00:42:53,531
Oh, I'm so sorry. I was scared.

318
00:42:57,493 --> 00:42:59,662
I shouldn't have run away.

319
00:42:59,745 --> 00:43:01,747
I was scared.

320
00:43:05,376 --> 00:43:07,795
Please forgive me.

321
00:43:07,879 --> 00:43:11,549
Please, sir. We need time to study her.
We need to run some tests.

322
00:43:11,632 --> 00:43:14,760
You can run tests on her corpse, Major.

323
00:43:17,889 --> 00:43:20,183
I love you, Don.

324
00:43:26,522 --> 00:43:28,608
Yeah.

325
00:43:30,735 --> 00:43:33,070
Oh, God, I love you, too.

326
00:44:48,271 --> 00:44:49,647
Don!

327
00:46:08,643 --> 00:46:13,105
Clear channels to control room.
Control room, this is General Stone.

328
00:46:13,189 --> 00:46:17,735
All forces under my control, prepare
to execute Code Red on my command.

329
00:46:17,819 --> 00:46:19,529
- Affirmative.
- Affirmative.

330
00:46:19,612 --> 00:46:23,449
Break, break, break, all stations.
Sunray in 30 seconds.

331
00:46:23,533 --> 00:46:27,453
We have an outbreak in the med centre.
All units, safeties off.

332
00:46:27,537 --> 00:46:30,206
- Affirmative.
- Open air cav transmission.

333
00:46:30,289 --> 00:46:34,752
- Prepare containment areas.
- Move civilians to containment areas.

334
00:46:34,836 --> 00:46:39,006
Command personnel secure in bunker.
Confirm order to lock down.

335
00:46:39,090 --> 00:46:41,425
Lockdown confirmed.

336
00:46:41,509 --> 00:46:43,803
Execute Code Red.

337
00:46:49,517 --> 00:46:54,689
Flynn, come in. Flynn, do you hear
that Code Red or am I losing my shit?

338
00:46:54,772 --> 00:46:56,649
I was about to ask the same thing.

339
00:46:59,735 --> 00:47:02,280
Ten-hut!

340
00:47:21,966 --> 00:47:26,888
Everything's fine. Don't worry.
I'll be back in a moment.

341
00:47:28,389 --> 00:47:32,226
- It's probably nothing.
- Tam, it didn't sound like nothing.

342
00:47:32,310 --> 00:47:34,729
He said he'd be back in a moment.

343
00:48:09,597 --> 00:48:11,891
Are you OK? Let's go.

344
00:48:14,852 --> 00:48:17,438
Come on.

345
00:48:18,564 --> 00:48:22,235
- Move, move, move! Let's go!
- Andy, keep hold of my hand.

346
00:48:22,318 --> 00:48:24,612
OK, come on. Keep it moving.

347
00:48:24,695 --> 00:48:26,823
Come on, people. Come on.

348
00:48:26,906 --> 00:48:30,618
- Don't push.
- Sir, all civilians into the containment area.

349
00:48:30,701 --> 00:48:36,249
These kids are with me. It's important they are
kept protected. I need to get them out of here.

350
00:48:36,332 --> 00:48:40,753
- Sir, no exceptions. It's a Code Red.
- I know what it is. My name is...

351
00:48:40,837 --> 00:48:42,588
- Andy!
- Scarlet!

352
00:48:42,672 --> 00:48:44,257
Andy!

353
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:45,633
- Tammy!
- Andy!

354
00:48:45,716 --> 00:48:47,468
- Andy, wait!
- Scarlet!

355
00:48:47,552 --> 00:48:50,471
- Just wait, Andy! We're coming!
- Calm down. Calm down, now.

356
00:48:59,397 --> 00:49:03,359
Move down. Move down the room.
Keep moving. Go, go, go. Come on.

357
00:49:03,442 --> 00:49:07,738
- You think it's a drill?
- Of course not. Someone saw an infected.

358
00:49:08,781 --> 00:49:11,909
Keep moving. That's it.
Good, good. Let's go.

359
00:49:11,993 --> 00:49:14,954
- Why are you sealing us inside?
- For your protection.

360
00:49:15,037 --> 00:49:18,916
- Just guard the door. Don't lock it.
- It's for your own protection.

361
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,711
- We've got to find Andy.
- We'll find him.

362
00:49:46,486 --> 00:49:50,239
- Shut down civilian areas.
- Sector one, lockdown.

363
00:49:50,323 --> 00:49:54,911
- Sector eight, lockdown.
- Sector three, lockdown.

364
00:50:11,677 --> 00:50:16,516
Switch to emergency lighting.
Use of non-lethal force authorised.

365
00:50:16,599 --> 00:50:19,143
All snipers in position.

366
00:50:19,227 --> 00:50:24,148
- Ground forces to med centre.
- Ground force to med centre.

367
00:50:25,066 --> 00:50:27,109
Sector one covered.

368
00:50:33,616 --> 00:50:36,410
Everyone, stay calm.

369
00:50:57,390 --> 00:50:59,267
Dad.

370
00:51:16,367 --> 00:51:18,452
No! My dad... my dad!

371
00:51:20,204 --> 00:51:22,165
He's in here!

372
00:52:31,025 --> 00:52:32,485
No!

373
00:52:32,568 --> 00:52:37,824
Containment area, containment area,
move into position.

374
00:52:47,333 --> 00:52:48,626
No!

375
00:53:02,431 --> 00:53:04,809
I confirm, only target infected.

376
00:53:04,892 --> 00:53:07,311
Roger that. Only target infected.

377
00:53:15,528 --> 00:53:18,281
Targeting right. I've had two down.

378
00:53:21,409 --> 00:53:24,120
Watch out for the friendlies.

379
00:53:24,203 --> 00:53:26,539
I can't get a shot.

380
00:53:28,249 --> 00:53:30,960
Oh, man, this is FUBAR.

381
00:53:33,087 --> 00:53:35,882
We got a group there at 12 o'clock.

382
00:53:35,965 --> 00:53:41,470
- We've got one at three o'clock.
- On the ground, got four.

383
00:53:42,722 --> 00:53:44,891
16 down.

384
00:53:48,352 --> 00:53:50,813
I got two by the Jeep.

385
00:53:53,316 --> 00:53:56,652
- Jesus.
- I don't see who's a target.

386
00:54:00,531 --> 00:54:04,744
On the move! On the move!
Moving right! Moving right!

387
00:54:05,495 --> 00:54:09,540
I can't find
the designated target here.

388
00:54:09,957 --> 00:54:12,668
I cannot be target-specific.

389
00:54:12,752 --> 00:54:16,547
Whisky Three, why have you stopped firing?
Come in.

390
00:54:16,631 --> 00:54:22,094
Abandon selective targeting.
Shoot everything. Targets are now free.

391
00:54:22,178 --> 00:54:24,347
We've lost control.

392
00:54:29,519 --> 00:54:35,650
All units, all units, this is Medical
Commanding Officer Sierra Lima.

393
00:54:35,733 --> 00:54:39,654
Please be on the lookout for a young boy,
age 12, name, Andy.

394
00:54:42,657 --> 00:54:47,662
If he is located he must be immediately
evacuated from the containment zone.

395
00:54:47,745 --> 00:54:49,831
We have to find Andy.

396
00:54:49,914 --> 00:54:52,792
- We have to find him!
- It's OK. It's OK.

397
00:54:52,875 --> 00:54:56,587
We're gonna find him, OK?
We're gonna find him, I promise.

398
00:54:56,671 --> 00:55:02,385
I'm gonna get him out of here.
I'm gonna get you both out of here. Trust me.

399
00:55:23,239 --> 00:55:27,034
- New shot.
- Abandon selective targeting.

400
00:55:28,494 --> 00:55:32,915
- Confirm order?
- Target everyone at ground level.

401
00:55:32,999 --> 00:55:36,419
No exceptions. Repeat, no exceptions.

402
00:55:44,343 --> 00:55:45,595
Come on!

403
00:56:03,446 --> 00:56:07,033
Three down.
One of ours down there. Three o'clock.

404
00:56:20,713 --> 00:56:22,882
- Taking them down.
- Left sector, three o'clock.

405
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:30,181
Kid! Over here!

406
00:56:30,264 --> 00:56:32,808
Kid! Over here!

407
00:56:46,656 --> 00:56:50,201
- I got him.
- Well, take him out. Take him out.

408
00:56:50,284 --> 00:56:53,788
Doyle, I got two fuckers on me!

409
00:56:55,206 --> 00:56:57,333
Fuck.

410
00:56:59,877 --> 00:57:01,963
Fuck.

411
00:57:11,305 --> 00:57:13,391
Fuck!

412
00:58:25,963 --> 00:58:27,340
Tam?

413
00:58:48,903 --> 00:58:50,988
This is madness.

414
00:58:52,114 --> 00:58:55,326
- What's happening?
- They're shooting everybody.

415
00:58:55,409 --> 00:59:00,540
- Why? It makes no sense.
- It makes perfect sense.

416
00:59:00,623 --> 00:59:02,500
It's Code Red.

417
00:59:15,429 --> 00:59:17,390
I saw Dad.

418
00:59:17,473 --> 00:59:19,892
Where?

419
00:59:19,976 --> 00:59:22,520
He's one of them.

420
00:59:23,688 --> 00:59:27,024
Step one, kill the infected.

421
00:59:27,108 --> 00:59:30,278
Step two, containment.

422
00:59:30,778 --> 00:59:33,072
If containment fails...

423
00:59:34,532 --> 00:59:37,451
step three, extermination.

424
00:59:38,077 --> 00:59:41,831
Now they won't stop until everyone is dead.

425
00:59:43,541 --> 00:59:45,626
So what do we do?

426
00:59:46,544 --> 00:59:50,631
I mean, I'm not sitting around here
to get exterminated.

427
00:59:50,715 --> 00:59:52,675
We've gotta get outta here.

428
00:59:52,758 --> 00:59:57,597
If we take one step out of that door,
if the infected don't get us, the snipers will.

429
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:01,017
Well, you don't have a choice, my friend.

430
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:05,730
Right now it's dark out there. The snipers
can see you through their night scopes,

431
01:00:05,813 --> 01:00:10,943
but at least you have
some limited cover from the infected.

432
01:00:11,027 --> 01:00:15,406
But, you know, if you wanna wait till sun-up
then you're as good as dead.

433
01:00:15,490 --> 01:00:17,700
Who are you?

434
01:00:17,783 --> 01:00:20,912
Sergeant Doyle. Delta rooftop unit.

435
01:00:21,454 --> 01:00:23,956
Why aren't you at your post?

436
01:00:25,041 --> 01:00:26,918
Why aren't you?

437
01:00:28,377 --> 01:00:33,799
Look, you guys do what you want,
but I'm gonna get the fuck outta here.

438
01:00:34,258 --> 01:00:36,802
You coming?

439
01:00:42,266 --> 01:00:44,268
All right, come on.

440
01:00:54,529 --> 01:00:57,073
- Less shooting.
- Maybe it's under control.

441
01:00:57,156 --> 01:00:59,575
Or there are less shooters.

442
01:01:00,243 --> 01:01:04,914
All right, listen. I need you guys
to look at me and only me, OK?

443
01:01:04,997 --> 01:01:08,584
You run when I run.
Be my shadow. That's it, all right?

444
01:01:08,668 --> 01:01:10,962
Get around back. Watch her.

445
01:01:12,755 --> 01:01:15,258
Ready? Let's go.

446
01:01:26,352 --> 01:01:28,813
Stay.

447
01:01:32,024 --> 01:01:34,527
Doyle, come in.

448
01:01:38,781 --> 01:01:42,702
- Flynn, go.
- Doyle, where the fuck are you, man?

449
01:01:46,247 --> 01:01:50,084
- Ground level, District One.
- Shit. Close frequency.

450
01:01:50,168 --> 01:01:52,295
Copy that.

451
01:01:54,547 --> 01:01:58,968
What the fuck are you doing there?
You got some serious shit coming your way.

452
01:01:59,051 --> 01:02:02,722
- We already got some serious shit.
- I'm not playing. This is worse.

453
01:02:02,805 --> 01:02:06,976
The air cav just got their orders.
They're firebombing all of District One.

454
01:02:07,059 --> 01:02:09,520
- That was fast.
- Outbreak is out of control.

455
01:02:09,604 --> 01:02:15,026
They're taking no chances. So unless you are
out of the target zone, you are getting cooked.

456
01:02:15,109 --> 01:02:18,529
- How long we got?
- They're on their way. Four minutes, tops.

457
01:02:18,613 --> 01:02:24,076
But listen. I got some clear landing ground
at Regent's Park. That's the pick-up point.

458
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:29,248
- I'll be back in touch.
- Doyle, you fucking better be.

459
01:02:29,707 --> 01:02:33,544
All right, look, guys, we gotta run.
Just stay low and stay fast, OK?

460
01:02:33,628 --> 01:02:35,922
After me. Let's go.

461
01:02:42,762 --> 01:02:45,890
- Snipers! Get down! Snipers!
- Back! Back! Back!

462
01:02:45,973 --> 01:02:47,809
Get back! Get back!

463
01:02:47,892 --> 01:02:50,812
Andy, get back!

464
01:02:50,895 --> 01:02:53,815
- Back!
- Andy, get in!

465
01:02:56,108 --> 01:02:58,069
- Shit.
- Fuck!

466
01:02:58,152 --> 01:03:01,072
It's OK. It's just a flesh wound.

467
01:03:16,879 --> 01:03:18,840
Multiple shots, one hit.

468
01:03:20,258 --> 01:03:22,844
He's a panicker, no marksman.

469
01:03:28,224 --> 01:03:30,476
OK.

470
01:03:30,977 --> 01:03:32,770
- What's your name?
- Sam.

471
01:03:32,854 --> 01:03:36,482
OK, Sam. Come here. Get closer.
Do you see that doorway?

472
01:03:36,566 --> 01:03:42,446
I need you to run as fast as you can in a
zigzag like this, OK? Don't stop for anything.

473
01:03:42,530 --> 01:03:48,119
- You want me to be bait?
- He'll take shots at you, but he'll miss.

474
01:03:48,202 --> 01:03:52,165
He's gonna expose his position.
Means I get a shot at him. I won't miss.

475
01:03:52,248 --> 01:03:55,376
- You're out of your fucking mind.
- Stay back.

476
01:03:56,586 --> 01:04:00,965
Two minutes, we're all gonna die.
You want that?

477
01:04:01,048 --> 01:04:02,425
No!

478
01:04:02,508 --> 01:04:03,968
Andy!

479
01:04:04,051 --> 01:04:05,136
Fuck!

480
01:04:30,495 --> 01:04:32,747
Good work, kid.

481
01:04:39,545 --> 01:04:42,507
- The fence!
- Watch it, watch it. Behind me.

482
01:04:42,590 --> 01:04:44,634
Go! Go! Go!

483
01:04:47,386 --> 01:04:49,889
Come on. Come on, come on.

484
01:04:50,556 --> 01:04:52,642
Jump!

485
01:05:08,866 --> 01:05:11,786
This is Red Fox One pouring whisky.

486
01:05:14,205 --> 01:05:17,834
Keep going!
We'll be safe under the river.

487
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:03,856
Go! Go!

488
01:07:07,151 --> 01:07:09,946
Come on. Come on!

489
01:07:15,493 --> 01:07:17,411
Run! Run!

490
01:07:32,093 --> 01:07:36,055
Bring in biological units.
Fan out from predesignated positions.

491
01:07:36,139 --> 01:07:38,432
Bio units, copy.

492
01:07:39,392 --> 01:07:45,648
Use of chemical weapons authorised.
Repeat, chemical weapons are authorised.

493
01:10:38,696 --> 01:10:40,781
Stay close.

494
01:10:59,133 --> 01:11:01,427
They left us again.

495
01:11:04,597 --> 01:11:07,433
Do you think Mum's still alive?

496
01:11:09,435 --> 01:11:11,521
Not this time.

497
01:11:46,222 --> 01:11:50,101
- You look a little pale.
- Blood makes me nauseous.

498
01:11:50,184 --> 01:11:53,354
You never answered my question.

499
01:11:53,437 --> 01:11:55,982
About why you left your post.

500
01:11:56,065 --> 01:11:58,317
When I got that boy in my sights.

501
01:12:02,446 --> 01:12:05,116
That's not a target any more.

502
01:12:09,620 --> 01:12:12,957
When we were separated...

503
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:15,668
I thought I'd lost you, too.

504
01:12:17,211 --> 01:12:20,590
We won't get separated again.

505
01:12:20,673 --> 01:12:24,260
We'll stay together, whatever happens.

506
01:12:25,261 --> 01:12:27,138
Whatever happens.

507
01:12:28,014 --> 01:12:30,308
It was all fucked.

508
01:12:33,144 --> 01:12:37,106
You could hear it all over the radios. Fucked.

509
01:12:42,361 --> 01:12:44,864
Anyway, what about you?

510
01:12:46,657 --> 01:12:52,914
- Why the hell are you here?
- Their mother had very special blood.

511
01:12:54,540 --> 01:12:58,085
A natural kind of immunity to the virus.

512
01:13:02,632 --> 01:13:05,384
Not all genetic traits are passed on, you know.

513
01:13:05,468 --> 01:13:09,806
They can skip a generation
or vanish altogether, but...

514
01:13:09,889 --> 01:13:12,892
But they might have it.

515
01:13:12,975 --> 01:13:15,061
It's a possibility.

516
01:13:17,271 --> 01:13:21,317
So their lives are far more valuable than mine.

517
01:13:24,403 --> 01:13:26,864
Or yours.

518
01:13:28,866 --> 01:13:30,284
I got it.

519
01:13:32,870 --> 01:13:34,956
Doyle!

520
01:13:36,040 --> 01:13:37,416
Doyle!

521
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:40,461
- Flynn, go.
- You made it!

522
01:13:40,545 --> 01:13:44,715
I knew you'd do it. Listen. I'm coming
to you right now, but keep a lookout.

523
01:13:44,799 --> 01:13:48,386
There's sightings of infected
that have escaped the firebombing.

524
01:13:48,469 --> 01:13:51,472
- Give me an ETA.
- About 60.

525
01:13:51,556 --> 01:13:54,600
- Minutes?
- No. Seconds.

526
01:13:57,979 --> 01:13:59,063
All right, kids. Come on.

527
01:14:03,734 --> 01:14:05,945
Get down. Down! Down!

528
01:14:27,842 --> 01:14:30,386
I see you. I'm coming in.

529
01:14:30,470 --> 01:14:36,350
Jesus, Doyle, you got people with you.
Who the fuck are those people?

530
01:14:49,530 --> 01:14:52,408
Doyle! Who the fuck are those people?

531
01:14:52,492 --> 01:14:56,746
I can't take 'em. We will be shot out of the sky
if I try to land at the base.

532
01:14:56,829 --> 01:15:00,374
No, no, don't take 'em to base!
Take 'em over the Channel!

533
01:15:00,458 --> 01:15:02,960
- What?
- We gotta get these kids outta here.

534
01:15:03,044 --> 01:15:05,880
Get the fuck in, Doyle!
I'm not taking 'em!

535
01:15:05,963 --> 01:15:09,550
- Get me out of here!
- Sam, come back!

536
01:15:09,634 --> 01:15:14,263
Hey, get the fuck off there!
Get that fucker off my ski!

537
01:15:14,347 --> 01:15:17,475
- OK, you wanna fly with me, asshole?
- Sam!

538
01:15:17,558 --> 01:15:20,061
Come on!

539
01:15:34,116 --> 01:15:35,451
Fuck!

540
01:15:35,535 --> 01:15:38,579
We're gonna die down here!
Do something!

541
01:15:38,663 --> 01:15:41,082
You wanna fuck?

542
01:15:43,125 --> 01:15:45,336
Come on, you fuckers!

543
01:15:54,679 --> 01:15:56,639
Get up! Run! Move it!

544
01:16:18,619 --> 01:16:21,789
Don't look back! Keep going!

545
01:16:22,874 --> 01:16:25,001
Keep going.

546
01:16:31,757 --> 01:16:34,135
Fuck you, pussy!

547
01:16:50,401 --> 01:16:52,737
Doyle, come in! Doyle!

548
01:16:52,820 --> 01:16:56,782
You need to get to safe ground.
Get to the stadium. Ditch those people.

549
01:16:56,866 --> 01:16:59,118
I'm not taking 'em.

550
01:17:12,173 --> 01:17:14,634
Flynn, come in.
Flynn, I know you can hear me.

551
01:17:14,717 --> 01:17:18,429
Fuck the Code Red, fuck the chain
of command. I need an extraction.

552
01:17:18,513 --> 01:17:20,973
You better fucking be there, cos we will be.

553
01:17:21,057 --> 01:17:24,143
You OK? Yeah?

554
01:17:24,227 --> 01:17:26,771
I bet you're tired, huh? Me, too.

555
01:17:26,854 --> 01:17:31,442
OK, I need you to help me, OK?
Help me with your sister. You got that?

556
01:17:31,526 --> 01:17:34,987
Come on. Gotta go. Gotta go.
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

557
01:18:03,057 --> 01:18:05,643
Gas! Get back! Get back!

558
01:18:05,726 --> 01:18:09,480
- Tammy, Andy, get in the car!
- It's gas! Run! Come on!

559
01:18:09,564 --> 01:18:13,359
Come on, get in the car! Get in the car!

560
01:18:13,442 --> 01:18:16,154
Come on! Get in! Get in!

561
01:18:16,821 --> 01:18:18,865
Get in, Andy!

562
01:18:19,782 --> 01:18:21,909
Go, go, go!

563
01:18:25,746 --> 01:18:27,874
Lock the doors!

564
01:18:29,041 --> 01:18:31,544
Get the vents, get the vents.

565
01:19:14,045 --> 01:19:18,007
- It won't start!
- We'll be fine, all right? Just keep trying.

566
01:19:18,090 --> 01:19:20,176
It won't start!

567
01:19:26,974 --> 01:19:30,520
Come on, come on, come on.
Keep trying. Keep trying!

568
01:19:30,603 --> 01:19:35,441
- It won't start! It won't fucking start!
- Fuck me!

569
01:19:37,276 --> 01:19:41,239
- It won't start!
- Put your foot on the clutch.

570
01:19:41,739 --> 01:19:47,370
All right. You pop the clutch when I tell you,
OK? You get them to the stadium. OK?

571
01:19:51,582 --> 01:19:54,210
Keep your head down.

572
01:19:59,465 --> 01:20:01,759
I'll meet you there.

573
01:20:01,843 --> 01:20:03,052
OK.

574
01:20:08,474 --> 01:20:10,184
- Doyle!
- Doyle!

575
01:20:21,654 --> 01:20:25,199
Pop it! Pop it!

576
01:20:27,368 --> 01:20:29,370
Go! Go!

577
01:20:30,371 --> 01:20:32,748
Go!

578
01:20:49,348 --> 01:20:51,976
Oh, my God...

579
01:21:13,206 --> 01:21:14,248
OK.

580
01:21:35,770 --> 01:21:37,688
Fuck!

581
01:21:52,328 --> 01:21:54,038
- Scarlet!
- Fuck!

582
01:21:57,708 --> 01:21:59,794
They're shooting at us!

583
01:22:15,476 --> 01:22:17,937
Hold on!

584
01:22:23,025 --> 01:22:25,319
Shit.

585
01:22:32,201 --> 01:22:34,287
OK, let's go.

586
01:22:44,213 --> 01:22:47,216
Come on, through here, guys.

587
01:23:02,815 --> 01:23:05,109
Just hold onto the rails.

588
01:23:08,988 --> 01:23:11,073
Careful, guys.

589
01:23:14,785 --> 01:23:15,953
OK.

590
01:23:16,496 --> 01:23:18,080
OK.

591
01:23:18,164 --> 01:23:21,083
It's OK. I can see. I can see.

592
01:23:21,167 --> 01:23:24,253
Keep going down.

593
01:23:28,925 --> 01:23:30,218
OK.

594
01:23:30,301 --> 01:23:34,555
Just keep walking straight, guys.

595
01:23:34,639 --> 01:23:36,933
Holding against the wall.

596
01:23:37,016 --> 01:23:40,269
You're doing really well. You're doing great.

597
01:23:40,353 --> 01:23:43,147
OK, get back! Get back against the wall!

598
01:23:43,231 --> 01:23:45,608
OK. Good.

599
01:23:45,691 --> 01:23:50,321
Just stay close. Slightly to the right, Andy.

600
01:23:50,780 --> 01:23:54,283
It's OK. I can see. It's OK.
I've got the night sight on.

601
01:23:54,367 --> 01:23:59,205
You're doing great. Just hold... hold the rail.
Nice and slow down the stairs, OK?

602
01:23:59,288 --> 01:24:02,208
Stop! Stop! Stop right now!

603
01:24:02,291 --> 01:24:04,710
OK, Tammy, to your left. Good.

604
01:24:04,794 --> 01:24:08,798
OK. Good girl. Just straight down.
Nice and slow. Slower.

605
01:24:09,507 --> 01:24:13,803
Stop! Stop, honey.
It's OK. It's OK. It's OK. All right?

606
01:24:14,554 --> 01:24:17,723
Grab hold of the other railing, OK?
Go to your right.

607
01:24:17,807 --> 01:24:22,520
- Scarlet, I can't see anything!
- Go to your right. Go to your right.

608
01:24:22,603 --> 01:24:27,650
All right. Keep trying to skip... Just put your
leg far out in front of you, OK? Good girl.

609
01:24:27,733 --> 01:24:30,111
Hold onto the rail. Careful!

610
01:24:32,947 --> 01:24:35,283
Tammy!

611
01:24:35,366 --> 01:24:37,743
Andy!

612
01:24:37,827 --> 01:24:39,912
Where are you?

613
01:24:44,458 --> 01:24:47,170
Andy! Where are you? Andy!

614
01:24:47,253 --> 01:24:49,297
Answer me!

615
01:24:49,380 --> 01:24:52,175
Where are you?

616
01:24:55,470 --> 01:24:57,013
Tammy!

617
01:24:59,056 --> 01:25:02,018
- Where are you?
- Scarlet!

618
01:25:02,101 --> 01:25:06,189
- Tammy, I'm coming. I'm right here.
- Scarlet, I've lost Andy!

619
01:25:06,272 --> 01:25:09,275
- I'm right here.
- I've lost Andy.

620
01:25:09,358 --> 01:25:12,945
There we go.
Just come slowly towards me.

621
01:25:13,029 --> 01:25:15,156
I've lost Andy.

622
01:25:15,990 --> 01:25:18,075
We'll find Andy.

623
01:25:26,626 --> 01:25:28,169
Scarlet!

624
01:25:39,722 --> 01:25:41,349
Andy!

625
01:25:41,432 --> 01:25:43,976
Where are you?

626
01:26:01,702 --> 01:26:04,789
Scarlet.

627
01:26:17,552 --> 01:26:19,178
Tammy?

628
01:26:19,262 --> 01:26:21,430
Tammy?

629
01:26:21,514 --> 01:26:23,349
Scarlet?

630
01:26:50,418 --> 01:26:51,961
No!

631
01:26:55,465 --> 01:26:56,591
Don!

632
01:27:55,525 --> 01:27:58,444
We stay together - whatever happens.

633
01:27:58,528 --> 01:28:01,030
- No!
- Andy!

634
01:28:01,113 --> 01:28:03,241
Andy, no!

635
01:28:03,324 --> 01:28:05,409
