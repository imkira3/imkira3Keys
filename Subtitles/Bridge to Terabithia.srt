2
00:03:07,338 --> 00:03:09,033
- Want toast?
- Yes.

3
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:10,801
Ellie, where's your cereal bowl?

4
00:03:10,874 --> 00:03:12,808
- I'm not hungry.
- You need to eat.

5
00:03:12,876 --> 00:03:15,743
- I'm not hungry, Mom.
- You need to eat before school.

6
00:03:15,813 --> 00:03:17,781
- One more bite.
- You want jelly?

7
00:03:17,848 --> 00:03:19,475
Yes, please.

8
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:22,678
Watch it, Brenda.
Don't mess my clothes up.

9
00:03:22,753 --> 00:03:24,721
Billy Baker's in my class this year.

10
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:26,756
- Oh, did he flunk too?
- Shut up!

11
00:03:26,824 --> 00:03:29,384
- Hey!
- You're one to talk.

12
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:32,395
- Are you excited about school?
- Yeah.

13
00:03:32,464 --> 00:03:34,398
- Isn't your sister cute?
- You stink.

14
00:03:34,466 --> 00:03:35,558
Very cute.

15
00:03:35,634 --> 00:03:38,603
He stinks. He's gotta shower
before he eats with us.

16
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:40,865
Stop picking
on your brother and eat.

17
00:03:44,776 --> 00:03:45,902
May Belle?

18
00:03:45,977 --> 00:03:48,104
- Honey, here's your juice.
- Thanks.

19
00:03:49,714 --> 00:03:51,682
OK, who hid my sneakers?

20
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:55,242
Jess, you could hardly call them
sneakers anymore. I threw them out.

21
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,981
What? Mom!

22
00:03:57,055 --> 00:04:00,958
Sorry, but I will not send any child of
mine to school looking like some hobo.

23
00:04:01,027 --> 00:04:04,428
There's a perfectly good old pair
of Brenda's I put out for you.

24
00:04:05,998 --> 00:04:07,465
These are girls' ones.

25
00:04:07,533 --> 00:04:10,229
It's the fan belt this time,
but I got another.

26
00:04:10,303 --> 00:04:12,897
- Bye-bye.
- Ellie? Honey, here you go.

27
00:04:12,972 --> 00:04:15,532
- What's the matter?
- There's a big race today.

28
00:04:15,608 --> 00:04:17,667
- And?
- My sneakers.

29
00:04:17,743 --> 00:04:20,940
- I got a perfectly good pair for him.
- These are girls' ones.

30
00:04:21,013 --> 00:04:24,107
- I can't race in these.
- You couldn't race in your old ones.

31
00:04:24,183 --> 00:04:26,175
He needs some new sneakers, Mary.

32
00:04:27,421 --> 00:04:30,948
- Catch Billy's eye in that.
- We don't have anything for extras.

33
00:04:31,024 --> 00:04:34,016
- Excuse me?
- You're excused.

34
00:04:34,094 --> 00:04:36,824
They make them the same.
You got your chores done?

35
00:04:38,265 --> 00:04:39,698
Just about to.

36
00:05:17,739 --> 00:05:21,437
I try to keep my pit stops
under ten seconds, ace.

37
00:05:22,544 --> 00:05:24,307
Give it to me.

38
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,746
- Give it...
- Hey, that's my lunch!

39
00:05:26,815 --> 00:05:28,248
I found it!

40
00:05:30,719 --> 00:05:33,711
You're kidding me.

41
00:05:34,323 --> 00:05:35,984
OK, that's enough.

42
00:05:36,392 --> 00:05:38,917
Consider it a free lunch program,
farmer boy!

43
00:05:38,994 --> 00:05:40,723
All right, settle down.

44
00:05:41,497 --> 00:05:42,828
Good one, Janice.

45
00:05:42,898 --> 00:05:45,663
What do you call your teacher?
I wanna tell Alexandra.

46
00:05:45,735 --> 00:05:48,363
- "Monster Mouth. " Now scoot.
- Alexandra,

47
00:05:48,438 --> 00:05:53,398
- they call her "Monster Mouth" Myers.
- I said scoot!

48
00:05:53,643 --> 00:05:55,412
A few ground rules for this classroom.

49
00:05:55,678 --> 00:05:59,705
No talking. No chewing gum.
No electronic devices. Be forewarned.

50
00:05:59,783 --> 00:06:01,944
If you download essays
off the Internet,

51
00:06:02,018 --> 00:06:04,953
you'll be downloaded into detention.

52
00:06:05,021 --> 00:06:08,718
Let's start the year off on
the right foot and all do our own work.

53
00:06:08,792 --> 00:06:11,660
- I expect you to take notes.
- Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep,

54
00:06:11,729 --> 00:06:15,961
Beep-beep-beep-beep-beep.
Know what that is? My loser detector.

55
00:06:18,202 --> 00:06:19,464
Jesse Aarons!

56
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:23,697
I got it from your sisters.
I do not need it from you.

57
00:06:23,774 --> 00:06:26,106
- Oh, man.
- That goes for you as well.

58
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:27,667
He hit me.

59
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:32,042
- You're dead meat.
- Scott Hoager and Gary Fulcher,

60
00:06:32,116 --> 00:06:33,140
be quiet!

61
00:06:33,751 --> 00:06:37,586
Now, back to what we were discussing
before we were so rudely interrupted.

62
00:06:37,656 --> 00:06:39,749
Sweet sneaks, Aarons.

63
00:06:39,825 --> 00:06:43,056
You wear your sisters'
hand-me-down underwear too?

64
00:06:43,128 --> 00:06:46,256
He asked you a question,
twinkle toes.

65
00:06:50,068 --> 00:06:53,663
Good morning, kids. Welcome back.
I hope you had a great summer.

66
00:06:53,738 --> 00:06:57,469
Mrs. Myers, this is Leslie Burke,
who will be joining your class.

67
00:06:57,542 --> 00:07:01,410
- Leslie, welcome to Lark Creek.
- Thanks.

68
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:05,076
Thank you, Principal Turner.

69
00:07:05,151 --> 00:07:08,279
Well, Leslie, um,
you'll sit at my desk this morning,

70
00:07:08,354 --> 00:07:11,517
until we can figure out
where to squeeze you in.

71
00:07:14,994 --> 00:07:18,122
I like to start the year
with a little fun.

72
00:07:18,197 --> 00:07:21,860
I want you all to write a one-page
essay about your favorite hobby.

73
00:07:21,934 --> 00:07:23,424
Yes?

74
00:07:23,503 --> 00:07:27,496
Mrs. Myers, when you say one page,
did you mean both sides of the paper?

75
00:07:27,573 --> 00:07:30,873
- You can do one side, Madison.
- I'll do two.

76
00:07:30,944 --> 00:07:34,209
- Yeah, that's cool.
- No way!

77
00:07:34,281 --> 00:07:37,148
- It was so amazing.
- Can I have this?

78
00:07:37,217 --> 00:07:40,550
You could have two bucks out of it all.
I'm getting most of it, OK?

79
00:07:41,955 --> 00:07:43,320
- Excuse me.
- Got a dollar?

80
00:07:43,891 --> 00:07:46,621
- No.
- You're gonna have to use your pants.

81
00:07:47,861 --> 00:07:50,352
- What's your problem?
- You got that backwards.

82
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:53,331
- You got the problem.
- That's right, new girl.

83
00:07:54,868 --> 00:07:58,305
- Nice feet.
- You say something?

84
00:07:58,373 --> 00:07:59,840
What I said was,

85
00:07:59,908 --> 00:08:03,366
have you ever heard the story
about the trolls under the bridges

86
00:08:03,444 --> 00:08:05,878
who collect tolls
from unlucky travelers?

87
00:08:05,947 --> 00:08:08,006
Trolls?
What is she talking about?

88
00:08:09,484 --> 00:08:12,817
Nice try, beanpole.
It's still a dollar.

89
00:08:33,809 --> 00:08:35,071
Yeah!

90
00:08:36,579 --> 00:08:39,446
- Let's do it. Do it.
- Yeah, we've got Hoager.

91
00:08:41,517 --> 00:08:44,452
Next grade, line up.
Let's do this thing. Come on.

92
00:08:44,987 --> 00:08:46,614
Fulcher, Hoager, get in here.

93
00:08:47,256 --> 00:08:49,589
Get ready.
Let's get this race started.

94
00:08:49,659 --> 00:08:51,456
- Beep, beep, beep.
- Dead meat.

95
00:08:51,528 --> 00:08:56,124
Back behind the line. You know
how it goes. Back behind. Come on.

96
00:08:56,199 --> 00:08:58,633
Hey, new girl.
This is just for guys.

97
00:08:58,702 --> 00:09:00,363
Hey, I'm talking to you!

98
00:09:00,437 --> 00:09:03,406
What's the matter?
Afraid a girl's gonna beat you?

99
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:08,143
- On your mark. Get set.
- Dead meat.

100
00:09:17,321 --> 00:09:18,788
Go, Hoager!
Get in there!

101
00:09:26,964 --> 00:09:30,092
Go! Go, Jess, go!

102
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,494
Come on!

103
00:09:34,572 --> 00:09:36,369
Come on! You can do it!

104
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,670
Come on, Jess!

105
00:09:38,743 --> 00:09:40,734
Go, Jess, go!

106
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:58,125
Jess, Jess, did you win?

107
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,198
Hey, Jess, right?

108
00:10:14,514 --> 00:10:16,778
- Idiot!
- What?

109
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:21,248
- See you tomorrow.
- Ten seconds, ace.

110
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:29,451
Thank you.

111
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:33,329
Are you following me?

112
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:35,265
No. I live over there.

113
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:38,236
We're neighbors?
You got little sisters?

114
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:41,206
- No. Just me.
- Oh.

115
00:10:41,275 --> 00:10:43,140
You got any Barbies?

116
00:10:43,444 --> 00:10:46,675
Yeah. I think I have a few.
You got any?

117
00:10:46,747 --> 00:10:50,843
- Yeah, I have one... and a half.
- And a half?

118
00:10:50,918 --> 00:10:54,149
One got cut in half
playing Super Extreme Barbies.

119
00:10:54,221 --> 00:10:55,654
Never heard of that before.

120
00:10:55,723 --> 00:10:57,691
You flush the toilet
with them in it,

121
00:10:57,758 --> 00:11:00,455
drop them from the upstairs window,
stuff like that.

122
00:11:00,528 --> 00:11:03,691
- It's really fun.
- Sounds like fun.

123
00:11:03,765 --> 00:11:07,326
- Well, I'll see you around.
- Yeah. See ya.

124
00:11:07,402 --> 00:11:08,699
- See ya.
- Hey, guys.

125
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:09,759
Hey, Dad.

126
00:11:09,838 --> 00:11:12,898
- I'm getting supplies. You wanna come?
- Yeah. Sure.

127
00:11:13,308 --> 00:11:14,707
See ya.

128
00:11:17,112 --> 00:11:19,512
There we go.
This'll make it feel better.

129
00:11:19,581 --> 00:11:22,744
- How come it's my fault?
- When I ask you to watch the baby,

130
00:11:22,817 --> 00:11:25,411
- I mean watch the baby, Brenda.
- It's Ellie's turn.

131
00:11:25,487 --> 00:11:28,423
- I'm doing my algebra.
- Put more cream on there.

132
00:11:28,491 --> 00:11:30,925
You girls have to start
helping out more here.

133
00:11:30,993 --> 00:11:32,654
You're not little kids anymore.

134
00:11:42,271 --> 00:11:45,434
May Belle! How many times have
I told you, stay out of my stuff.

135
00:11:45,508 --> 00:11:47,567
- It wasn't me.
- It was too you.

136
00:11:47,643 --> 00:11:50,339
- You can't prove it!
- There a problem here?

137
00:11:50,412 --> 00:11:52,710
- Daddy!
- Hey, sweetie.

138
00:11:52,783 --> 00:11:54,978
Is he picking on you?

139
00:11:55,819 --> 00:11:58,845
- She was in my stuff.
- What stuff?

140
00:12:08,265 --> 00:12:09,960
How'd that race go?

141
00:12:10,033 --> 00:12:12,593
There's this new girl
moved in next door.

142
00:12:12,669 --> 00:12:15,934
She beat all of the boys.
Even Jess.

143
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:22,274
Make sure you take out
the garbage before supper.

144
00:12:22,547 --> 00:12:25,607
One drop.

145
00:12:25,683 --> 00:12:29,119
And that's the magic.
Here comes May Belle's flowers.

146
00:12:31,255 --> 00:12:32,745
Are these ever gonna grow?

147
00:12:32,824 --> 00:12:36,260
This greenhouse is gonna be filled
with your purple flowers.

148
00:12:36,327 --> 00:12:39,319
May Belle's flowers.

149
00:12:40,264 --> 00:12:43,631
I always wanted the one
that had, like, purple all over it.

150
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:47,461
They are so cool.

151
00:12:47,539 --> 00:12:50,007
- These things are gonna grow fast.
- Me too.

152
00:12:50,075 --> 00:12:52,942
- Tomorrow, it's gonna be filled.
- Yeah.

153
00:12:53,011 --> 00:12:56,208
The bell's gonna ring!

154
00:12:56,281 --> 00:12:59,739
- Good morning, everybody!
- Good morning, Ms. Edmunds!

155
00:12:59,818 --> 00:13:01,877
Aren't you glad
that summer's over?

156
00:13:01,954 --> 00:13:05,412
- No!
- No? I am.

157
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:07,685
Come and get your instruments.

158
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:09,624
- Can I play the woodblock?
- Yes.

159
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:14,159
Ms. Edmunds?
May I please play the castanets?

160
00:13:14,234 --> 00:13:17,465
Yes, you may.
Everybody ready for music?

161
00:13:18,037 --> 00:13:20,699
Take a picture.
Lasts longer.

162
00:13:20,907 --> 00:13:24,138
<i>It's awfully quiet.
# Old McDonald had a farm...</i>

163
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:27,145
- No!
- No? You don't like that song?

164
00:13:27,213 --> 00:13:29,681
- No!
- Then make some noise. Come on.

165
00:14:31,147 --> 00:14:33,479
- We saw this video yesterday.
- Whatever.

166
00:14:33,549 --> 00:14:36,313
Change it!
Give it... give it to me!

167
00:14:36,385 --> 00:14:38,615
Stop it.
You're always fighting.

168
00:14:38,688 --> 00:14:42,089
- Wait till I get my own place.
- I wanna watch this.

169
00:14:42,158 --> 00:14:45,127
We just
can't keep going like this.

170
00:14:45,194 --> 00:14:48,561
Honey, uh... I've only got what I've got
to work with. We gotta...

171
00:14:48,631 --> 00:14:51,156
You gotta figure out
a way to get down on this.

172
00:14:51,233 --> 00:14:54,168
It's a problem,
but I'm gonna try to get going.

173
00:14:54,236 --> 00:14:58,037
And maybe you can pick up
another shift at the store.

174
00:14:59,343 --> 00:15:00,833
Dead meat.

175
00:15:04,348 --> 00:15:06,316
Wow.

176
00:15:06,383 --> 00:15:09,181
You're really good at drawing.

177
00:15:09,252 --> 00:15:12,244
Like, better than any kid
I've ever seen.

178
00:15:12,322 --> 00:15:13,914
Uh... Thanks.

179
00:15:17,327 --> 00:15:20,387
I wanna share
this composition for two reasons.

180
00:15:20,464 --> 00:15:23,923
One, it uses adjectives well.
And two,

181
00:15:24,002 --> 00:15:28,769
it's clear the author paid attention
to what she saw and what she felt,

182
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:32,332
which is important for any writing.

183
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:37,313
<i>Self-Contained Underwater
Breathing Apparatus by Leslie Burke.</i>

184
00:15:38,182 --> 00:15:40,412
Leslie, why don't you read it for us.

185
00:15:41,119 --> 00:15:42,814
Oh, man. Can you believe this?

186
00:15:52,398 --> 00:15:54,229
"I'm moving gently forward,

187
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,869
over the wild and beautiful,
unexplored world below me.

188
00:15:59,171 --> 00:16:01,435
I'm floating in silence,

189
00:16:01,774 --> 00:16:04,538
and breaking it up
with the sound of my breath.

190
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:08,546
Above me, there's nothing
but shimmery light,

191
00:16:08,614 --> 00:16:10,605
the place where I've come from,

192
00:16:10,682 --> 00:16:13,150
and will go back to
when I am done here.

193
00:16:13,218 --> 00:16:15,652
I'm diving.

194
00:16:15,721 --> 00:16:18,384
I'm a scuba diver.

195
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:22,019
I'm going deeper past
the wrinkled rocks and dark seaweed

196
00:16:22,095 --> 00:16:26,156
toward a deep blueness
where a school of silver fish wait.

197
00:16:27,467 --> 00:16:30,163
As I swim through the water,

198
00:16:30,236 --> 00:16:32,864
bubbles burst from me,

199
00:16:32,939 --> 00:16:35,840
wobbling like little jellyfish
as they rise.

200
00:16:35,909 --> 00:16:37,877
I check my air.

201
00:16:37,944 --> 00:16:40,913
I don't have as much time
as I need to see everything,

202
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,779
but that is what makes it so special. "

203
00:16:44,685 --> 00:16:48,212
Thank you, Leslie.
Now tonight at 7:00 on channel four

204
00:16:48,289 --> 00:16:52,589
there is a special about
an undersea explorer, Dr. Bob Ballard.

205
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:56,994
I want everyone to watch and write one
page about what you've learned.

206
00:16:57,064 --> 00:16:58,531
Leslie?

207
00:16:58,599 --> 00:17:00,726
What if you can't watch this program?

208
00:17:00,801 --> 00:17:04,396
Inform your parents it's an assignment,
I'm sure they won't object.

209
00:17:04,472 --> 00:17:07,532
But... what if you don't have a TV?

210
00:17:14,649 --> 00:17:16,776
My dad says the TV
kills your brain cells.

211
00:17:16,852 --> 00:17:21,152
Your dad doesn't know anything.
We watch TV, like, every day.

212
00:17:21,223 --> 00:17:23,453
- I rest my case.
- Well, then, Leslie,

213
00:17:23,525 --> 00:17:27,461
you don't have to write this essay.
Pick something else to write about.

214
00:17:27,529 --> 00:17:30,123
Yeah, like, how to live in a cave.

215
00:17:30,198 --> 00:17:32,359
That's enough, Mr. Hoager.

216
00:17:38,374 --> 00:17:40,137
Hey, Leslie, come here.

217
00:17:40,209 --> 00:17:43,440
What are you gonna write your essay on?
Bats in caves?

218
00:17:57,426 --> 00:18:00,589
- Here comes Janice!
- New kid's in Janice's seat.

219
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:04,862
- What does she think she's doing?
- Jess! The big kids will kill her!

220
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:08,934
You have a death wish?
This row's for eighth-graders.

221
00:18:09,006 --> 00:18:13,875
That's right, beanpole. Move it.
Out of my way, farm boy.

222
00:18:32,197 --> 00:18:34,597
You're really asking for it.

223
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:37,794
Seems to me she gives it out
whether you ask for it or not.

224
00:18:37,869 --> 00:18:40,030
So might as well have some fun.

225
00:18:40,104 --> 00:18:43,835
Getting Janice all wound up
is a weird way of having fun.

226
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:48,343
Well, what's your idea of having fun?

227
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,274
- I don't know.
- Well, you wanna do something?

228
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:54,511
- I don't know.
- Let's do something. Definitely.

229
00:18:54,587 --> 00:18:55,884
- What?
- You can't do it.

230
00:18:55,955 --> 00:18:58,753
- Do what?
- What we're doing.

231
00:19:03,796 --> 00:19:07,197
Hey, May Belle!
I don't use my Barbies anymore.

232
00:19:07,266 --> 00:19:10,531
- If you want, you can have them.
- To keep for permanent?

233
00:19:10,603 --> 00:19:12,571
- Sure.
- Thanks.

234
00:19:15,341 --> 00:19:17,002
You're lucky to have a sister.

235
00:19:17,076 --> 00:19:19,943
I've got four, and I'd
trade them all for a good dog.

236
00:19:20,012 --> 00:19:22,379
I'd love to have a dog.

237
00:19:22,449 --> 00:19:24,747
Now let's go before
she changes her mind.

238
00:19:25,385 --> 00:19:28,286
Race you to the end of the road.
On your mark, get set, go!

239
00:19:59,153 --> 00:20:01,087
Come on, Jess!

240
00:20:01,155 --> 00:20:02,281
Come on!

241
00:20:07,328 --> 00:20:09,558
What about sharks?

242
00:20:11,198 --> 00:20:13,929
You ever see any sharks while you're

243
00:20:14,002 --> 00:20:16,163
scuba-ing or whatever?

244
00:20:16,238 --> 00:20:18,934
I've never gone scuba diving
in my whole life.

245
00:20:20,342 --> 00:20:23,834
- You lied in your essay?
- No. I made it up.

246
00:20:23,912 --> 00:20:26,176
It's different from lying.

247
00:20:27,683 --> 00:20:30,914
Those drawings you make,
you seen those things yourself?

248
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,754
No, but...

249
00:20:38,327 --> 00:20:39,852
Hey! Look at that!

250
00:20:40,296 --> 00:20:42,196
- Cool!
- That's been there forever.

251
00:20:42,265 --> 00:20:43,664
I wouldn't trust it.

252
00:20:44,467 --> 00:20:46,298
Come on. Just try it.

253
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:50,195
OK.

254
00:20:56,779 --> 00:20:58,940
You got it? That's it.

255
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,915
Thanks.

256
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:07,486
- What are you doing?
- Getting up higher.

257
00:21:09,426 --> 00:21:10,723
OK.

258
00:21:18,969 --> 00:21:22,234
Wow! That was so much fun.
You have to try it. Come on.

259
00:21:43,695 --> 00:21:45,128
OK.

260
00:22:02,782 --> 00:22:04,943
Let your head hang back,
watch the clouds.

261
00:22:05,017 --> 00:22:06,848
Feels like flying.

262
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:37,307
- We need a place. Just for us.
- Hmm?

263
00:22:37,451 --> 00:22:40,386
Where there's no
Janice Averys or Scott Hoagers.

264
00:22:40,454 --> 00:22:44,288
Yeah, but when we go back to school,
there they are waiting.

265
00:22:44,357 --> 00:22:46,052
Yeah, but...

266
00:22:46,126 --> 00:22:49,289
...someplace better than
just not being at school.

267
00:22:49,996 --> 00:22:52,932
What if there was a magical kingdom
only we knew about?

268
00:22:54,101 --> 00:22:55,762
I don't know. What if?

269
00:22:55,837 --> 00:22:58,101
OK, well...

270
00:22:58,172 --> 00:23:00,834
...what if the only way
we could enter it

271
00:23:00,908 --> 00:23:03,274
is by swinging on this enchanted rope?

272
00:23:03,344 --> 00:23:06,313
- Enchanted rope?
- Yeah.

273
00:23:07,215 --> 00:23:08,842
Come on.

274
00:23:14,055 --> 00:23:16,114
Leslie!

275
00:23:17,493 --> 00:23:18,517
Leslie!

276
00:23:29,471 --> 00:23:31,234
Leslie.

277
00:23:36,445 --> 00:23:38,777
- Come on!
- Wait up.

278
00:24:08,411 --> 00:24:09,935
Ahh!

279
00:24:10,013 --> 00:24:12,574
We shouldn't be in here.
This isn't our land.

280
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:15,710
- Not so loud. They'll hear you.
- What are you talking about?

281
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,755
Hey! What's that?

282
00:24:26,864 --> 00:24:30,391
Whoa. Jess, look at this. Wow.

283
00:24:32,903 --> 00:24:36,339
Too bad for them.
They got so close.

284
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:39,571
- What are you talking about?
- To the kingdom.

285
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,508
- What's that?
- What?

286
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:47,780
That sound. I've heard it before.
Someone's out there.

287
00:24:47,852 --> 00:24:50,844
That's the sound of the prisoners
rattling their chains.

288
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:53,556
What prisoners?

289
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:56,059
The prisoners of the Dark Master.

290
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:02,934
- We should go.
- Wait, Jess, look.

291
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,897
What is it?

292
00:25:10,076 --> 00:25:11,600
Look at this.

293
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:21,680
Wow. This is amazing.

294
00:25:26,058 --> 00:25:27,252
Wow.

295
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,028
This is it.

296
00:25:56,257 --> 00:25:57,918
Warriors.

297
00:25:59,661 --> 00:26:03,495
- Try dragonflies.
- No. They're warriors.

298
00:26:03,564 --> 00:26:05,930
From the treetop provinces.

299
00:26:07,101 --> 00:26:11,333
- I don't know this game.
- What game? This is for real.

300
00:26:13,708 --> 00:26:17,542
This is the ruins
of a once great fortress

301
00:26:17,612 --> 00:26:20,103
whose people have been imprisoned.

302
00:26:22,217 --> 00:26:25,186
Jess, you and I have been
sent to free them.

303
00:26:27,356 --> 00:26:30,689
Prisoners of the Dark Master, hear me!

304
00:26:31,326 --> 00:26:34,090
We have come to free you.

305
00:26:34,163 --> 00:26:35,824
Do you hear us?

306
00:26:35,898 --> 00:26:37,866
Show me that you hear us!

307
00:26:45,874 --> 00:26:49,311
You got lucky timing. The wind's
been blowing off and on all day.

308
00:26:51,114 --> 00:26:55,847
Can't hear you!

309
00:27:30,554 --> 00:27:33,648
- Go straight home. I'll see you soon.
- OK. See ya!

310
00:28:58,912 --> 00:29:01,643
Hey, don't you think
we should give her a hand?

311
00:29:04,886 --> 00:29:06,478
Uh... She's... She's fine.

312
00:29:06,988 --> 00:29:09,479
Beep, beep, beep, beep.

313
00:29:09,557 --> 00:29:11,218
...forget. There are four of us.

314
00:29:11,292 --> 00:29:12,623
OK.

315
00:29:14,562 --> 00:29:16,553
Remember to bring your bag.

316
00:29:16,631 --> 00:29:19,099
Why would anyone
want to wear that?

317
00:29:24,739 --> 00:29:26,173
Janice!

318
00:29:26,242 --> 00:29:27,869
- You OK?
- What's the problem?

319
00:29:27,943 --> 00:29:30,707
- Jess Aarons tripped me.
- Uh...

320
00:29:30,779 --> 00:29:32,838
On purpose.

321
00:29:32,915 --> 00:29:35,509
OK, Aarons. Hit the road.

322
00:29:36,652 --> 00:29:38,950
- But he didn't do anything.
- Go.

323
00:29:39,021 --> 00:29:42,752
- It was definitely him.
- I know.

324
00:29:58,141 --> 00:30:02,305
- What happened to you?
- Janice is a very talented person.

325
00:30:02,379 --> 00:30:05,212
She can shoot ketchup packets
over four rows of seats.

326
00:30:05,282 --> 00:30:07,045
Jeez.

327
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:10,544
Can I wash up at your house?
My mom sees this, she'll be all over

328
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:13,248
the principal and everybody,
and my life will be over.

329
00:30:16,259 --> 00:30:19,354
<i>Why would Dad do this?</i>

330
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:21,364
- Oh. Hello.
- Oh.

331
00:30:21,432 --> 00:30:23,866
Mom, this is Leslie.

332
00:30:23,935 --> 00:30:25,800
- Hi, Leslie.
- Hi.

333
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:28,566
- It's nice to meet you.
- Thank you. You too.

334
00:30:29,707 --> 00:30:32,301
So are you and your family
getting settled in OK?

335
00:30:32,376 --> 00:30:35,777
- Yes, ma'am.
- That's nice.

336
00:30:35,846 --> 00:30:38,474
- Come on. See ya later.
- Not too late, OK, honey?

337
00:30:39,283 --> 00:30:44,243
- Weird and weirder.
- Hey. Be glad he's found a friend.

338
00:30:44,322 --> 00:30:48,054
- Where's your dad work?
- At home. Same as my mom.

339
00:30:48,126 --> 00:30:50,219
- They're writers.
- Writers?

340
00:30:50,295 --> 00:30:53,389
- What do they write about?
- Fiction.

341
00:30:53,465 --> 00:30:55,092
That explains you.

342
00:30:56,568 --> 00:31:00,004
- What do you mean?
- Well, you like to make things up.

343
00:31:00,072 --> 00:31:02,563
And that's what your parents
do for a living.

344
00:31:03,942 --> 00:31:06,570
You know a lot about hardware?

345
00:31:06,645 --> 00:31:08,579
No. Why?

346
00:31:08,647 --> 00:31:12,209
Well, your dad works
at a hardware store.

347
00:31:12,285 --> 00:31:13,946
OK.

348
00:31:14,454 --> 00:31:17,150
All I'm saying is that
you are who you are...

349
00:31:17,223 --> 00:31:18,884
...not your parents.

350
00:31:21,394 --> 00:31:24,955
If they work at your house, you must
get to hang out with them a lot.

351
00:31:27,734 --> 00:31:29,497
Not really.

352
00:31:31,971 --> 00:31:33,734
What's that?

353
00:31:33,806 --> 00:31:36,673
- Grenade.
- There're no grenades here.

354
00:31:40,047 --> 00:31:41,241
Come on!

355
00:31:44,918 --> 00:31:48,319
- Squirrels!
- Part squirrel, part Scott Hoager.

356
00:31:48,389 --> 00:31:51,415
- Squogre.
- Squogre!

357
00:31:51,792 --> 00:31:54,317
The sneaky foot soldiers
of the Dark Master.

358
00:31:55,462 --> 00:31:57,692
- They're attacking!
- We need ammo!

359
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,465
This is not good.

360
00:32:09,377 --> 00:32:12,869
- See them? Up there?
- Yeah.

361
00:32:12,947 --> 00:32:16,974
- Do you? Really?
- Yeah.

362
00:32:27,662 --> 00:32:28,924
Les...

363
00:32:30,098 --> 00:32:31,259
Leslie?

364
00:32:33,002 --> 00:32:36,301
Leslie. Leslie!

365
00:32:38,007 --> 00:32:40,567
Come on. You can see
the whole kingdom from up here.

366
00:32:44,146 --> 00:32:47,172
Isn't this cool?
We can do anything here.

367
00:32:56,893 --> 00:32:58,793
Look at it.

368
00:32:58,862 --> 00:33:01,592
It's all ours.

369
00:33:01,665 --> 00:33:05,157
From the mountains to the oceans.

370
00:33:08,071 --> 00:33:10,733
- What am I looking for exactly?
- You'll see.

371
00:33:10,807 --> 00:33:13,776
Just close your eyes...

372
00:33:13,844 --> 00:33:15,607
...but keep your mind wide open.

373
00:33:30,361 --> 00:33:31,555
Wow.

374
00:33:33,297 --> 00:33:35,356
What do we call this place?

375
00:33:38,402 --> 00:33:39,994
Terabithia.

376
00:33:46,677 --> 00:33:51,138
Shh.
Everybody tiptoe. OK, ready?

377
00:33:52,017 --> 00:33:54,417
Happy birthday!

378
00:33:54,486 --> 00:34:01,420
<i># Happy birthday to you</i>

379
00:34:01,493 --> 00:34:05,327
<i># Happy birthday, dear Jess</i>

380
00:34:05,397 --> 00:34:08,332
<i># Happy birthday to you #</i>

381
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:09,997
Make a wish.

382
00:34:10,836 --> 00:34:12,827
- Yay!
- What'd you wish for?

383
00:34:18,945 --> 00:34:22,403
- This is cheap junk.
- No, it isn't.

384
00:34:22,482 --> 00:34:25,280
- I love it.
- How? It doesn't even work.

385
00:34:25,351 --> 00:34:28,115
I don't think we have
the hang of it yet, Dad.

386
00:34:28,188 --> 00:34:31,248
You know what? Keep the box.
We'll see if we can take it back.

387
00:34:33,226 --> 00:34:35,751
Daddy, there's something
in the greenhouse.

388
00:34:41,634 --> 00:34:45,002
That's the last thing I need,
some animal chewing it's way in here.

389
00:34:46,006 --> 00:34:48,372
What are you going to do
if you catch it?

390
00:34:48,442 --> 00:34:50,740
These vegetables are our livelihood.

391
00:34:50,811 --> 00:34:54,008
Can't afford to share them
with animals that get in here.

392
00:34:54,915 --> 00:34:56,883
- So, you're gonna kill it?
- Have to.

393
00:34:59,486 --> 00:35:03,718
Well, he's not gonna
get in here now, right, Dad?

394
00:35:03,791 --> 00:35:07,488
Hope not. But if he does,
you just let me deal with it.

395
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:11,194
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

396
00:35:11,266 --> 00:35:14,997
No, why don't you go on and do
your homework, I'll clean this mess up.

397
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:28,816
Under the seat.

398
00:35:33,755 --> 00:35:35,917
I heard it was
your birthday yesterday.

399
00:35:40,162 --> 00:35:43,097
- Like it?
- Wow.

400
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:46,424
It must've cost a fortune.

401
00:35:46,969 --> 00:35:49,164
What's it matter what it costs?

402
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:51,368
I don't know.

403
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,876
Well, I can take it back
and get a cheaper one, if you want.

404
00:35:56,646 --> 00:35:59,638
Thanks... a lot.

405
00:36:00,549 --> 00:36:03,451
<i># Jess and Leslie sitting in a tree...</i>

406
00:36:14,665 --> 00:36:16,690
Look.
The squogre and the vulture.

407
00:36:16,767 --> 00:36:18,462
Hey, here he comes.

408
00:36:18,535 --> 00:36:22,062
And a guy who can stand up to a squogre
is scared of a Hoager?

409
00:36:25,108 --> 00:36:27,201
Ms. Edmunds?

410
00:36:27,277 --> 00:36:30,145
- He speaks.
- Can I help you with those?

411
00:36:30,214 --> 00:36:33,615
You sure can.
And you just made my day.

412
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,653
- Great.
- I'll get that one.

413
00:36:37,722 --> 00:36:39,019
Thank you.

414
00:36:46,197 --> 00:36:49,257
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, hi, boys.

415
00:36:56,408 --> 00:36:58,808
How come you're so good at that?

416
00:36:58,877 --> 00:37:01,038
- Good at what?
- Building stuff.

417
00:37:01,113 --> 00:37:02,637
You're good at it for a girl.

418
00:37:02,715 --> 00:37:05,616
Same way I'm fast... for a girl.

419
00:37:05,684 --> 00:37:08,209
You know what I mean.

420
00:37:08,287 --> 00:37:11,381
You're pretty good at art... for a boy.

421
00:37:11,457 --> 00:37:13,357
OK, OK, truce.

422
00:37:17,496 --> 00:37:19,964
Don't your parents notice
this stuff's missing?

423
00:37:20,066 --> 00:37:22,466
Not when they're in
the middle of writing a book.

424
00:37:22,535 --> 00:37:25,095
What's that?

425
00:37:26,272 --> 00:37:27,466
Show yourselves!

426
00:37:41,087 --> 00:37:43,453
It's a giant troll!

427
00:37:43,523 --> 00:37:45,753
No, it's a giant tree
that almost killed us!

428
00:37:45,825 --> 00:37:48,317
You think that tree
just fell all by itself?

429
00:37:49,563 --> 00:37:50,655
Come on.

430
00:37:50,731 --> 00:37:54,167
When the Dark Master saw
the squogres weren't scaring us away,

431
00:37:54,235 --> 00:37:57,727
- he sent a giant troll.
- How big?

432
00:38:02,243 --> 00:38:04,234
That's how big its feet are.

433
00:38:07,481 --> 00:38:10,678
- You really think so?
- What else could it be?

434
00:38:12,453 --> 00:38:14,285
What should we do?

435
00:38:19,795 --> 00:38:23,629
If we had a troll hunter, we could
track its scent and sneak up on it.

436
00:38:24,433 --> 00:38:26,424
Hey, look at that! Come on!

437
00:38:29,204 --> 00:38:30,671
I think it went that way!

438
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,905
We rule Terabithia,
and nothing crushes us!

439
00:38:39,682 --> 00:38:41,274
I'll race you to the rope.

440
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:49,881
I love this place!

441
00:39:07,711 --> 00:39:10,475
Go on, get out of here.
And don't come back.

442
00:39:24,261 --> 00:39:26,252
What do you think you're doing?

443
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:30,289
- I took care of it for you.
- Did you, now? Now, how'd you do that?

444
00:39:30,367 --> 00:39:33,269
I took him into the forest.
He's not coming back, promise.

445
00:39:33,338 --> 00:39:36,705
Did he tell you he's gonna
stay the hell out of the greenhouse?

446
00:39:36,774 --> 00:39:39,265
No, he went out there
and he's not coming...

447
00:39:39,344 --> 00:39:41,608
Jess, you need to understand
something, OK?

448
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:45,547
This is not one of your cartoons. This
is just a pest that eats up our food,

449
00:39:45,617 --> 00:39:47,778
money we earn and time we don't have.

450
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:51,053
- OK.
- Get your head out of the clouds

451
00:39:51,122 --> 00:39:52,316
and do as I say.

452
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:55,087
OK.

453
00:40:25,292 --> 00:40:27,226
Good night, sweetheart.

454
00:40:28,962 --> 00:40:30,554
Sweet dreams.

455
00:40:31,631 --> 00:40:35,032
Lights out, Jess.

456
00:40:35,101 --> 00:40:36,728
Night, Dad.

457
00:40:42,943 --> 00:40:45,707
Are we slaying the giant troll
after school today?

458
00:40:45,779 --> 00:40:48,543
You've got your head
in the clouds, Leslie.

459
00:40:48,615 --> 00:40:52,143
- Huh?
- There is no giant troll, all right?

460
00:40:52,219 --> 00:40:56,019
Well, you better not let
the Terabithians hear you.

461
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:57,990
They thought you were their king.

462
00:41:12,273 --> 00:41:15,902
Alexandra, my daddy gave me Twinkies!

463
00:41:15,977 --> 00:41:19,209
Neither one squished, 'cause I
didn't put them next to my drink.

464
00:41:19,281 --> 00:41:21,112
I'd shut up about those Twinkies.

465
00:41:21,183 --> 00:41:23,947
You're just mad 'cause I
got some and you didn't.

466
00:41:24,019 --> 00:41:26,283
Whatever. Don't cry to me
when you lose them.

467
00:41:26,355 --> 00:41:27,913
I'll eat them, not lose them.

468
00:41:33,629 --> 00:41:36,462
Jess! Jess!

469
00:41:36,531 --> 00:41:40,592
Janice Avery stole my Twinkies!
Janice Avery stole my Twinkies!

470
00:41:40,669 --> 00:41:44,504
- I told you, keep your mouth shut.
- She's there. What are you gonna do?

471
00:41:44,574 --> 00:41:46,769
And she makes you pay to pee!

472
00:41:48,177 --> 00:41:49,872
It's a dollar, shorty.

473
00:41:49,946 --> 00:41:53,643
But I don't have a dollar.

474
00:41:53,716 --> 00:41:57,277
That's not fair, is it?
Peeing's definitely supposed to be free.

475
00:41:57,353 --> 00:41:58,718
Free to pee!

476
00:41:58,788 --> 00:42:01,985
Free to pee! Free to pee! Free to pee!

477
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:06,019
Let's go.

478
00:42:18,475 --> 00:42:20,807
I want my Twinkies, Janice Avery.

479
00:42:20,878 --> 00:42:22,812
What Twinkies, Twinkie?

480
00:42:24,114 --> 00:42:27,413
You're supposed to beat her up.
You're my brother!

481
00:42:27,484 --> 00:42:30,612
Do you know what would happen
if I were to pick a fight with her?

482
00:42:30,688 --> 00:42:32,883
You'll get your butt kicked.

483
00:42:32,956 --> 00:42:36,916
No, I'd get kicked out of school for
fighting a girl. What's that prove?

484
00:42:36,995 --> 00:42:39,725
She stole my Twinkies.

485
00:42:41,299 --> 00:42:43,062
Come on.

486
00:42:44,936 --> 00:42:46,767
It's all right, May Belle.

487
00:42:46,838 --> 00:42:50,706
We'll get her back. Won't we, Jess?

488
00:42:55,246 --> 00:42:58,044
<i>Don't let
the Terabithians hear you.</i>

489
00:42:58,116 --> 00:43:00,050
<i>They thought you were their king.</i>

490
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:22,298
Jess! Jess!

491
00:43:32,786 --> 00:43:36,347
Oh... Hi! Look at you!

492
00:43:36,423 --> 00:43:41,190
That is your very own, certified,
purebred, giant troll hunter.

493
00:43:41,795 --> 00:43:43,228
- He's for me?
- Yeah,

494
00:43:43,296 --> 00:43:45,696
he just took a giant
pee all over my sweatshirt.

495
00:43:45,766 --> 00:43:48,234
Wow, Jess. Thank you.

496
00:43:52,706 --> 00:43:54,799
I name you Prince Terrien,

497
00:43:54,875 --> 00:43:57,777
giant troll hunter extraordinaire.

498
00:43:57,845 --> 00:43:59,813
P.T. For short.

499
00:44:03,384 --> 00:44:05,614
Hey! I think he smells a troll.
Come on.

500
00:44:09,056 --> 00:44:11,718
Oh, no! We've got company!

501
00:44:11,793 --> 00:44:13,988
Dead meat! Dead meat!

502
00:44:15,329 --> 00:44:17,889
- Dead meat! Dead meat!
- Hairy Vultures!

503
00:44:19,901 --> 00:44:21,563
What's that?

504
00:44:26,675 --> 00:44:29,439
It's a giant troll.

505
00:44:33,649 --> 00:44:35,014
Nice feet.

506
00:44:37,719 --> 00:44:39,050
Run!

507
00:44:42,024 --> 00:44:43,457
Oh, my gosh!

508
00:44:50,166 --> 00:44:52,293
I think we lost it.

509
00:44:54,337 --> 00:44:58,967
Leslie...

510
00:44:59,042 --> 00:45:01,636
- What's its weak spot?
- Does it have a weak spot?

511
00:45:01,711 --> 00:45:03,178
I don't know!

512
00:45:04,814 --> 00:45:08,011
Just making it madder!

513
00:45:08,618 --> 00:45:10,347
P.T.!

514
00:45:13,122 --> 00:45:15,717
That's it! That's its weak spot!

515
00:45:15,793 --> 00:45:17,727
It's ticklish!

516
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:21,960
- Gross!
- Troll toe jam.

517
00:45:22,933 --> 00:45:25,128
Good boy, P.T. Good boy!

518
00:45:25,703 --> 00:45:27,330
Good dog.

519
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:35,440
What's Janice's weak spot, you think?

520
00:45:37,314 --> 00:45:39,680
Eighth-grade girl...

521
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:41,548
...probably eighth-grade boys.

522
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:43,679
Who's she got a crush on?

523
00:45:43,755 --> 00:45:46,383
I don't know. Let's see...

524
00:45:46,458 --> 00:45:49,985
...coolest boy in
eighth grade is probably...

525
00:45:50,061 --> 00:45:51,619
...Willard Hughes.

526
00:45:51,696 --> 00:45:54,164
- That's it.
- What's it?

527
00:45:55,634 --> 00:45:58,501
Write, "Dear Janice... "

528
00:45:58,570 --> 00:46:01,232
- You do it.
- No way.

529
00:46:01,306 --> 00:46:03,831
Boys' handwriting sucks.
No offense.

530
00:46:03,909 --> 00:46:05,103
It's gotta be you.

531
00:46:07,546 --> 00:46:09,207
OK.

532
00:46:09,282 --> 00:46:11,250
"Dear Janice,

533
00:46:11,317 --> 00:46:14,844
<i>you're the most amazing and
beautiful person I've ever known. "</i>

534
00:46:14,921 --> 00:46:18,755
- How do I know which desk is hers?
- It's got dried-up blood and old bones.

535
00:46:23,162 --> 00:46:26,598
<i>"I do not know if you know this
about me, but I need to tell you,</i>

536
00:46:26,666 --> 00:46:30,067
<i>I think you are so cool.</i>

537
00:46:30,136 --> 00:46:34,005
You are the coolest over
all the other girls in our school. "

538
00:46:34,074 --> 00:46:35,598
OK. Write this,

539
00:46:35,676 --> 00:46:39,305
<i>"Let's find out if what
I think we have is real. "</i>

540
00:46:43,183 --> 00:46:45,413
- Oh, Mr. Bailey...
- Huh?

541
00:46:45,485 --> 00:46:48,943
...I was looking for you.
- Me? Why?

542
00:46:49,022 --> 00:46:52,253
I think someone threw up
in the girls' room.

543
00:46:52,326 --> 00:46:54,521
All right, I'll take a look.

544
00:47:00,435 --> 00:47:03,336
"Meet me by the bus
after school today.

545
00:47:03,404 --> 00:47:06,669
We can ride home together
and talk about us. "

546
00:47:08,443 --> 00:47:11,105
<i>Underline and capitalize the "us. "</i>

547
00:47:11,179 --> 00:47:13,340
"All my love, Willard. "

548
00:47:16,551 --> 00:47:19,679
You know, if we get caught,
they're both gonna kill us.

549
00:47:29,531 --> 00:47:32,261
- I got your note.
- What are you talking about?

550
00:47:32,334 --> 00:47:33,926
That was really sweet.

551
00:47:34,003 --> 00:47:36,335
- I'm saving these seats.
- For who?

552
00:47:36,405 --> 00:47:39,169
Willard Hughes is gonna
ride Janice home today.

553
00:47:39,241 --> 00:47:42,005
- What are you talking about?
- Willard and Janice.

554
00:47:42,077 --> 00:47:44,272
They're totally in love.

555
00:47:44,346 --> 00:47:47,611
In your dreams.
Well, you better tell Willard that.

556
00:47:47,683 --> 00:47:50,049
It looks like he's
heading home in his own bus.

557
00:47:59,529 --> 00:48:01,429
Look at Janice!

558
00:48:05,268 --> 00:48:07,998
Hey, Janice, what happened?

559
00:48:08,071 --> 00:48:10,369
Didn't Willard know
he's in love with you?

560
00:48:13,076 --> 00:48:15,670
Where's
your boyfriend, Janice?

561
00:48:23,788 --> 00:48:27,315
- What just happened?
- He just walked away.

562
00:48:34,131 --> 00:48:36,224
- Yes.
- You wanna go?

563
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:38,234
- Yeah.
- I wanna come.

564
00:48:38,302 --> 00:48:41,897
- You can't.
- It's a free country!

565
00:48:41,972 --> 00:48:45,272
Don't follow us, or I'll tell Alexandra
you still suck your thumb

566
00:48:45,343 --> 00:48:47,277
and sleep with Mr. Blanky.

567
00:48:49,815 --> 00:48:53,751
- So, what do you say?
- They must have finished their book.

568
00:48:53,819 --> 00:48:56,117
- How do you know?
- Hey, Leslie.

569
00:48:56,188 --> 00:48:58,782
- We need your help.
- Come on.

570
00:49:03,462 --> 00:49:06,363
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, Leslie, come on.

571
00:49:06,431 --> 00:49:08,626
All right, let's go.
We're on a mission.

572
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:11,033
Hey, this is my friend, Jess.
Can he help?

573
00:49:11,104 --> 00:49:14,096
So, you're the infamous Jess.
Hi, I'm Judy.

574
00:49:14,173 --> 00:49:16,903
Leslie tells me you're good
with a paint brush.

575
00:49:16,976 --> 00:49:18,637
Grab one and get going.

576
00:49:18,711 --> 00:49:21,646
Come on! I am determined
to have this wall finished

577
00:49:21,714 --> 00:49:25,275
so when the late sun hits it,
we can watch it catch fire.

578
00:49:29,522 --> 00:49:33,720
Now, that's one steady hand, Jess.
That's an artist's hand. Am I right?

579
00:49:35,128 --> 00:49:36,686
Yeah.

580
00:49:36,996 --> 00:49:39,295
You know,
the best prize that life offers,

581
00:49:39,366 --> 00:49:42,130
is the chance to work hard
at work worth doing.

582
00:49:42,202 --> 00:49:44,261
Teddy Roosevelt said that, not me.

583
00:50:22,076 --> 00:50:26,012
- Wow.
- What did I tell you? Was it worth it?

584
00:50:54,210 --> 00:50:55,734
Hey, guys.

585
00:50:55,811 --> 00:50:58,303
Jess, get started on your homework, OK?

586
00:50:58,381 --> 00:51:01,009
I'm managing the store
on weekends, starting soon,

587
00:51:01,084 --> 00:51:03,848
I need you to pick up
on some chores around here.

588
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:06,514
You know, the best prize
that life can offer

589
00:51:06,590 --> 00:51:09,457
is working hard at work worth doing.

590
00:51:24,242 --> 00:51:25,504
Hey...

591
00:51:27,712 --> 00:51:30,146
...have you taken art classes?

592
00:51:30,214 --> 00:51:33,615
No, I...
I just made them up myself.

593
00:51:33,684 --> 00:51:35,481
You're really talented.

594
00:51:38,823 --> 00:51:42,156
Jess, don't let those other kids
get in your way.

595
00:51:44,462 --> 00:51:47,727
- Oh, here you go.
- Thank you.

596
00:51:52,170 --> 00:51:54,070
I just went to use the girl's room.

597
00:51:54,139 --> 00:51:56,437
Someone's in a stall,
crying their eyes out,

598
00:51:56,508 --> 00:51:58,669
and I think it's Janice Avery.

599
00:51:58,744 --> 00:52:00,712
It can't be the trick we played, can it?

600
00:52:00,779 --> 00:52:02,610
No way. But come here.

601
00:52:06,885 --> 00:52:08,716
Free to pee!

602
00:52:08,954 --> 00:52:10,945
Get out of here!

603
00:52:11,023 --> 00:52:14,481
Get out of here, now!

604
00:52:16,396 --> 00:52:19,331
- You should go talk to her.
- You kidding?

605
00:52:19,399 --> 00:52:22,766
It's not "skinned knee crying,"
it's something serious.

606
00:52:22,835 --> 00:52:25,201
It's the girls' bathroom,
I can't go in there.

607
00:52:25,271 --> 00:52:28,331
- I don't wanna go in there alone.
- What's the matter?

608
00:52:28,408 --> 00:52:32,367
A girl who can stand up to a giant troll
is afraid of some dumb eighth grader?

609
00:53:05,713 --> 00:53:06,975
Sorry.

610
00:53:07,047 --> 00:53:10,347
- Go on, tell me.
- No, I don't wanna tell you.

611
00:53:10,418 --> 00:53:12,943
- Why not?
- I'll tell you there.

612
00:53:16,858 --> 00:53:20,817
He, like, came up to me.
I'm pretty sure he likes me.

613
00:53:28,336 --> 00:53:30,964
No way! I like Tony!

614
00:53:34,977 --> 00:53:37,537
Her dad gets really mad at her.

615
00:53:37,613 --> 00:53:41,413
So? My dad gets mad at me...
pretty much all the time.

616
00:53:41,484 --> 00:53:43,748
- He hits her.
- Oh.

617
00:53:43,819 --> 00:53:47,812
Some neighbor heard them
yelling so loud, they called the police.

618
00:53:47,890 --> 00:53:52,020
And it got out. And all the seventh
and the eighth graders know about it.

619
00:53:52,094 --> 00:53:57,259
- Whoa.
- Which explains, like, a lot.

620
00:53:59,301 --> 00:54:02,567
Well, what did you say to her?

621
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:06,166
Well, I told her about not having a TV

622
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:08,143
and everyone laughing at me.

623
00:54:08,211 --> 00:54:11,203
I know what it's like
to have everyone think I was weird.

624
00:54:11,281 --> 00:54:13,272
Then what'd she say?

625
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:15,511
She asked me for advice.

626
00:54:16,653 --> 00:54:18,587
Janice Avery asked you for advice?

627
00:54:18,655 --> 00:54:21,055
- Yeah.
- And?

628
00:54:21,124 --> 00:54:23,524
Well, I told her just to pretend

629
00:54:23,593 --> 00:54:26,721
that she had no idea
what anyone was talking about,

630
00:54:26,797 --> 00:54:31,599
and in a few weeks' time,
everybody would just forget about it.

631
00:54:31,669 --> 00:54:33,569
Man...

632
00:54:33,638 --> 00:54:35,265
Then I gave her a piece of gum.

633
00:54:36,641 --> 00:54:38,700
- We should go.
- Yeah.

634
00:54:39,677 --> 00:54:42,840
- Wanna come back tomorrow?
- Can't. I got chores.

635
00:54:42,914 --> 00:54:45,781
- How about the next day?
- Sunday we go to church.

636
00:54:45,850 --> 00:54:47,909
- Can I come?
- You'd hate it.

637
00:54:47,985 --> 00:54:51,512
- No, I think it'd be cool.
- Uh, girls can't wear pants.

638
00:54:51,589 --> 00:54:55,959
- I've got dresses, Jess.
- You in a dress? That'd be a sight!

639
00:54:56,562 --> 00:54:57,654
See ya!

640
00:55:48,983 --> 00:55:52,077
That's what we need.
Bells... in Terabithia.

641
00:55:57,057 --> 00:55:59,025
I'm really glad I came.

642
00:55:59,093 --> 00:56:01,994
That whole Jesus thing,
it's really interesting.

643
00:56:02,062 --> 00:56:04,428
It's not interesting.
It's scary!

644
00:56:04,498 --> 00:56:06,898
It's nailing holes through your hands.

645
00:56:06,967 --> 00:56:10,664
It's 'cause we're all vile sinners.
God made Jesus die.

646
00:56:10,738 --> 00:56:13,606
- You really think that's true?
- It's in the Bible.

647
00:56:14,142 --> 00:56:16,235
You have to believe it,
and you hate it.

648
00:56:16,878 --> 00:56:20,041
I don't have to believe it,
and I think it's beautiful.

649
00:56:20,115 --> 00:56:22,948
- You gotta believe the Bible, Leslie.
- Why?

650
00:56:23,018 --> 00:56:25,748
'Cause if you
don't believe in the Bible,

651
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:27,981
God will damn you to hell when you die.

652
00:56:28,056 --> 00:56:30,251
Wow, May Belle.
Where'd you hear that?

653
00:56:30,325 --> 00:56:32,122
That's right, huh, Jess?

654
00:56:32,193 --> 00:56:36,391
God damns you to hell
if you don't believe in the Bible.

655
00:56:36,464 --> 00:56:38,933
- I think so.
- Well, I don't think so.

656
00:56:39,001 --> 00:56:42,835
I seriously do not think God
goes around damning people to hell.

657
00:56:42,905 --> 00:56:45,567
He's too busy running all this.

658
00:56:51,581 --> 00:56:54,516
Hey, Jess.
Give me a hand.

659
00:56:55,785 --> 00:56:57,720
Yeah. I'm coming.

660
00:56:59,655 --> 00:57:01,919
Get my drill out of the greenhouse.

661
00:57:20,510 --> 00:57:22,501
You haven't managed
to kill those yet?

662
00:57:22,579 --> 00:57:24,308
Not funny.

663
00:57:24,381 --> 00:57:25,575
Look.

664
00:57:26,216 --> 00:57:28,352
Ever thought of
putting them in the sun?

665
00:57:42,967 --> 00:57:45,435
Jess. Jess.

666
00:57:45,503 --> 00:57:48,768
- Where are my keys?
- What?

667
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:51,775
My keys. You never gave them back to me.

668
00:57:59,685 --> 00:58:01,619
- Think!
- I put the drill down here.

669
00:58:01,687 --> 00:58:04,884
Damn it, the keys to the store
are on it, the register, all of it.

670
00:58:04,957 --> 00:58:07,983
They have to replace those locks,
$ 700 out of my paycheck.

671
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:09,618
They gotta be right here.

672
00:58:09,695 --> 00:58:12,960
- If I don't have those keys...
- I'll find them, Dad. I promise.

673
00:58:13,032 --> 00:58:16,263
Why don't you draw me some money
to pay for it? How about that?

674
00:58:16,335 --> 00:58:18,530
Make yourself useful,
draw me some money.

675
00:58:18,604 --> 00:58:20,037
I said I'll find them.

676
00:58:24,811 --> 00:58:28,440
You look awful.
What's the matter?

677
00:58:28,515 --> 00:58:30,415
I lost the keys where my dad works,

678
00:58:30,483 --> 00:58:33,281
and now he has to get
new keys made, and locks.

679
00:58:33,353 --> 00:58:34,980
May Belle?

680
00:58:35,055 --> 00:58:37,455
Please don't anyone get mad at me.

681
00:58:37,524 --> 00:58:39,890
- What?
- He...

682
00:58:39,959 --> 00:58:43,190
- I know where your dad's keys are.
- You do?

683
00:58:43,863 --> 00:58:46,627
You know the bells
we talked about making?

684
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:50,033
Well, it was meant to be a surprise.

685
00:58:50,103 --> 00:58:52,038
All that clanking metal and junk.

686
00:58:52,106 --> 00:58:54,768
And... May Belle wanted to help.

687
00:58:54,842 --> 00:58:56,366
And you let her?

688
00:58:57,912 --> 00:59:00,380
Why did you tell me
you found them on the ground?

689
00:59:00,448 --> 00:59:03,008
- They were.
- On the ground in the greenhouse.

690
00:59:03,084 --> 00:59:05,552
What's the matter with you?
Dad wants to kill me.

691
00:59:05,619 --> 00:59:08,213
I was waiting for the right time.

692
00:59:10,725 --> 00:59:12,693
So you know where the keys are?

693
00:59:23,271 --> 00:59:24,568
See ya later.

694
00:59:27,242 --> 00:59:30,507
- Tell Mom I'll be home in a bit.
- Are you gonna tell Dad it was me?

695
00:59:30,579 --> 00:59:33,946
Don't worry. It's my job
to get Dad's keys back. See you later.

696
00:59:41,690 --> 00:59:43,249
Whoa.

697
00:59:43,326 --> 00:59:46,489
Look how high it got.
Come on. Let's go.

698
00:59:51,334 --> 00:59:54,565
"Get your head out of the clouds, boy.
Draw me some money.

699
00:59:54,637 --> 00:59:58,198
- Make yourself useful, draw me money. "
- What are you going on about?

700
00:59:58,274 --> 01:00:01,334
"This isn't one of your cartoons.
This is serious. "

701
01:00:01,410 --> 01:00:05,744
What's so great about being serious
all the time anyway? Tell me that.

702
01:00:11,121 --> 01:00:13,612
What if the Dark Master
gets the keys first?

703
01:00:13,690 --> 01:00:16,921
I'm not scared of any Dark Master,
and those are my dad's keys.

704
01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:32,831
Leslie, get behind me.

705
01:00:35,212 --> 01:00:37,306
Jess, turn around. There's more.

706
01:00:38,616 --> 01:00:40,015
Here, take this.

707
01:00:43,621 --> 01:00:45,612
Jess!

708
01:00:55,733 --> 01:00:56,961
P.T., get him!

709
01:01:04,710 --> 01:01:06,769
Good boy, P.T.

710
01:01:19,658 --> 01:01:20,682
Yeah!

711
01:01:20,759 --> 01:01:24,058
- Dead meat! Dead meat! Dead meat!
- Whoa!

712
01:01:26,966 --> 01:01:28,024
Run!

713
01:01:28,869 --> 01:01:30,700
Come on! Faster!

714
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:33,671
Dead meat! Dead meat!

715
01:01:35,876 --> 01:01:37,173
Dead meat! Dead meat!

716
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:44,541
Told you they were grenades.

717
01:01:52,893 --> 01:01:54,019
Jess!

718
01:01:54,094 --> 01:01:55,824
I got you, Leslie!

719
01:01:56,764 --> 01:01:57,924
I got you!

720
01:01:59,467 --> 01:02:01,401
Up ahead! Get ready!

721
01:02:06,507 --> 01:02:10,341
- They'll catch us.
- We're the fastest in Terabithia.

722
01:02:20,288 --> 01:02:21,950
He's watching us.

723
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:27,357
Where are the keys?

724
01:02:27,429 --> 01:02:29,659
Here, open this.

725
01:02:42,344 --> 01:02:44,972
Where are Terabithian warriors
when you need them?

726
01:02:45,047 --> 01:02:46,912
I don't know.

727
01:02:50,553 --> 01:02:52,646
Great. Now there's three of us.

728
01:02:59,529 --> 01:03:02,157
- Wow.
- Now we're even.

729
01:03:02,231 --> 01:03:03,664
Attack!

730
01:03:12,875 --> 01:03:17,108
Dead meat! Dead meat!
Dead meat! Dead meat! Dead meat!

731
01:03:18,615 --> 01:03:19,604
Come on.

732
01:03:20,284 --> 01:03:23,720
- Come on, P.T.
- Dead meat!

733
01:03:46,411 --> 01:03:48,936
Be careful!
You're almost there.

734
01:03:56,187 --> 01:03:58,519
Jess!

735
01:03:59,057 --> 01:04:00,319
Jess!

736
01:04:18,644 --> 01:04:19,770
Hey.

737
01:05:09,797 --> 01:05:11,856
- See ya!
- Yeah, see ya.

738
01:06:02,485 --> 01:06:05,010
Jess! I called you three times.

739
01:06:05,088 --> 01:06:06,316
It's your girlfriend.

740
01:06:06,389 --> 01:06:08,482
She's not my girlfriend.

741
01:06:09,559 --> 01:06:11,686
<i>- Hey.
- Hello, Jess.</i>

742
01:06:11,761 --> 01:06:13,786
Wait. Who is this?

743
01:06:13,863 --> 01:06:16,491
It's Saturday, but it's
your teacher, Ms. Edmunds.

744
01:06:16,566 --> 01:06:20,970
I was planning on taking my nephews
into the city to the museum,

745
01:06:21,038 --> 01:06:24,940
and my sister changed her plans
last minute, so I had a thought.

746
01:06:29,413 --> 01:06:32,211
- Hey, Mom.
- Hmm? Is it the baby?

747
01:06:32,283 --> 01:06:35,013
No, she's fine.
May Belle's got her.

748
01:06:35,085 --> 01:06:38,612
Teacher wants me to go
on a field trip today.

749
01:06:38,689 --> 01:06:41,487
- Is that OK?
- Mmm.

750
01:06:45,797 --> 01:06:47,697
Ms. Edmunds? Yeah, I can go.

751
01:06:55,941 --> 01:06:57,704
- All set?
- Yeah.

752
01:06:57,776 --> 01:06:59,175
- Yeah?
- Yes, ma'am.

753
01:07:06,451 --> 01:07:08,385
Forget something?

754
01:07:10,355 --> 01:07:12,688
No. I'm good.

755
01:07:48,895 --> 01:07:50,590
Wow.

756
01:07:55,936 --> 01:07:57,597
Honey, honey, stay here.

757
01:08:00,841 --> 01:08:03,402
- Do you like it?
- Yeah.

758
01:08:03,478 --> 01:08:06,572
It's Brueghel.
It's one of my favorites.

759
01:08:06,648 --> 01:08:10,015
I wonder if he started in notebooks
like you. I know da Vinci did.

760
01:08:14,822 --> 01:08:17,916
It's amazing how much
detail's put into it.

761
01:08:17,992 --> 01:08:20,324
You've been to a museum before, right?

762
01:08:20,395 --> 01:08:23,831
- No, it's my first time.
- Really?

763
01:08:23,898 --> 01:08:26,628
- Yup.
- Well, then I'm honored.

764
01:09:06,209 --> 01:09:08,040
It's such a nice day out.

765
01:09:08,111 --> 01:09:12,411
It's been raining so much, I began
to think it was like that Japanese myth

766
01:09:12,482 --> 01:09:16,475
where the sun goes into the cave
and vows never to come out.

767
01:09:16,553 --> 01:09:19,784
- You know about everything.
- Not by a long shot.

768
01:09:19,856 --> 01:09:21,881
But I do try to keep an open mind,

769
01:09:21,958 --> 01:09:24,553
and you'd be surprised
what finds its way in there.

770
01:09:24,628 --> 01:09:28,291
That's what Leslie Burke says.
She told me to keep my mind wide open.

771
01:09:28,366 --> 01:09:30,027
Leslie Burke is right.

772
01:09:30,101 --> 01:09:33,764
Mind like yours wide open,
you could create a whole new world.

773
01:09:41,645 --> 01:09:45,513
- Thank you very much.
- You're very welcome.

774
01:09:45,583 --> 01:09:49,213
- Maybe we could do this again sometime.
- Absolutely.

775
01:09:54,025 --> 01:09:56,493
- Hey, guys.
- See? I told you.

776
01:09:56,561 --> 01:09:58,620
Oh, my God, Jess!

777
01:10:00,298 --> 01:10:03,563
- Where in God's name have you been?
- Where have you been?

778
01:10:04,736 --> 01:10:07,068
Mom...

779
01:10:07,139 --> 01:10:09,630
I asked you. It wasn't like I...

780
01:10:09,708 --> 01:10:12,404
- They thought you were dead.
- Brenda, hush.

781
01:10:12,477 --> 01:10:14,274
Dead?

782
01:10:15,481 --> 01:10:17,244
What's going on?

783
01:10:24,023 --> 01:10:26,423
Your friend Leslie's dead.

784
01:10:28,261 --> 01:10:30,092
She drowned in a creek this morning.

785
01:10:30,163 --> 01:10:33,792
Apparently she tried to swing
across on a rope and it broke.

786
01:10:33,866 --> 01:10:36,096
They think she hit her head.

787
01:10:37,937 --> 01:10:41,396
No... No, it's not that kind of rope.

788
01:10:41,475 --> 01:10:45,104
It couldn't break.
It... wouldn't have.

789
01:10:45,179 --> 01:10:47,204
But it did.

790
01:10:50,484 --> 01:10:54,113
- I'm sorry, son.
- No, you're lying.

791
01:10:55,022 --> 01:10:59,049
- She's not even dead. You're lying!
- Jess!

792
01:12:33,357 --> 01:12:36,622
Hi, honey. You want some breakfast?

793
01:12:36,694 --> 01:12:39,458
I... I gotta do my chores first.

794
01:12:39,530 --> 01:12:42,294
Your dad's doing everything today.
You just sit down.

795
01:12:58,317 --> 01:13:00,080
Jess, your father and I thought

796
01:13:00,152 --> 01:13:02,814
we'd go to the Burkes today
and pay our respects.

797
01:13:02,888 --> 01:13:05,220
Just the three of us.

798
01:13:06,258 --> 01:13:07,691
Paying what?

799
01:13:29,148 --> 01:13:30,911
Prince Terrien. Shh.

800
01:13:31,818 --> 01:13:33,752
You must be Jess.

801
01:13:42,962 --> 01:13:47,696
I'm Mr. Aarons. This is my wife, Mary.
Very sorry about your loss.

802
01:13:47,768 --> 01:13:50,293
- I'm so sorry.
- Hi, Jess.

803
01:13:58,312 --> 01:14:00,303
She loved you, you know.

804
01:14:01,315 --> 01:14:02,805
You know, Leslie,

805
01:14:02,883 --> 01:14:06,842
she never had much luck
making friends at her old school.

806
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:10,253
We were hoping that when
we moved out here she would...

807
01:14:14,496 --> 01:14:16,930
She said
if it wasn't for you...

808
01:14:19,334 --> 01:14:21,598
You're the best friend she's ever had.

809
01:14:21,670 --> 01:14:23,638
I wanna thank you for that.

810
01:14:25,140 --> 01:14:27,199
You're welcome.

811
01:14:30,311 --> 01:14:33,303
My wife and I were wondering
about the service.

812
01:14:36,851 --> 01:14:40,447
We've decided to bring Leslie
back home until the service.

813
01:14:46,195 --> 01:14:50,188
- Jess.
- Next time,

814
01:14:50,266 --> 01:14:53,258
we should invite Leslie to go.

815
01:14:55,137 --> 01:14:57,332
She'd like that.

816
01:15:06,817 --> 01:15:08,341
Hey, kid.

817
01:15:09,786 --> 01:15:11,947
Sorry about your friend.

818
01:15:14,424 --> 01:15:18,952
The purpose
of object pronouns...

819
01:15:19,029 --> 01:15:22,157
So looks like you're
the fastest kid in the class now, huh?

820
01:15:24,534 --> 01:15:26,627
It's a joke, dude.

821
01:15:31,209 --> 01:15:33,234
- Are you nuts?
- Jess Aarons.

822
01:15:33,845 --> 01:15:35,938
Go wait for me out in the hall.

823
01:15:37,381 --> 01:15:39,815
Silent reading until I get back.

824
01:15:49,193 --> 01:15:50,922
Jess...

825
01:15:57,603 --> 01:16:00,504
When my husband died...

826
01:16:00,572 --> 01:16:03,564
...people kept telling me not to cry.

827
01:16:04,676 --> 01:16:07,076
People kept trying to help me to forget.

828
01:16:10,382 --> 01:16:12,714
But I didn't wanna forget.

829
01:16:12,785 --> 01:16:15,117
Excuse me.

830
01:16:17,890 --> 01:16:20,484
The things that girl came up with.

831
01:16:22,528 --> 01:16:25,123
I don't get students like her too often.

832
01:16:29,702 --> 01:16:32,170
So I realize...

833
01:16:32,238 --> 01:16:34,968
...that if it's hard for me...

834
01:16:35,041 --> 01:16:37,566
...how much harder it must be for you.

835
01:17:25,193 --> 01:17:27,354
Hurry up.
We're gonna miss the bus!

836
01:17:36,738 --> 01:17:38,501
Hey.

837
01:18:25,689 --> 01:18:27,748
Leslie?!

838
01:18:52,483 --> 01:18:54,610
Jess!

839
01:18:54,686 --> 01:18:56,210
Leslie!

840
01:18:56,287 --> 01:18:59,723
- Jess!
- Leslie!

841
01:19:06,198 --> 01:19:07,825
Lesl...

842
01:19:07,900 --> 01:19:10,892
Help me, I can't get across! Hurry!

843
01:19:12,104 --> 01:19:14,072
May Belle?

844
01:19:16,508 --> 01:19:18,703
Hold on! Don't move!

845
01:19:20,346 --> 01:19:22,837
Here, grab my arm.
I got you, don't worry.

846
01:19:28,188 --> 01:19:30,748
- What were you thinking?
- I was worried about you!

847
01:19:30,824 --> 01:19:33,622
Well, don't be. I don't want you here!

848
01:19:34,227 --> 01:19:37,025
- But I wanna come with you.
- This is our place. Go home.

849
01:19:37,097 --> 01:19:38,962
This is our place!

850
01:19:43,103 --> 01:19:44,468
I said go home!

851
01:19:59,587 --> 01:20:01,452
Honey, what's the matter?

852
01:20:02,423 --> 01:20:04,391
What's the matter?

853
01:20:04,458 --> 01:20:06,392
What's the matter, baby?

854
01:21:11,060 --> 01:21:12,789
No!

855
01:21:14,364 --> 01:21:16,093
Jess!

856
01:21:17,101 --> 01:21:19,865
It's OK, Jess.
It's OK, son, it's OK.

857
01:21:19,937 --> 01:21:21,734
It's all gone.

858
01:21:25,209 --> 01:21:27,677
Is it like the Bible says?

859
01:21:27,744 --> 01:21:29,644
Is she going to hell?

860
01:21:30,347 --> 01:21:32,144
I don't know everything about God,

861
01:21:32,216 --> 01:21:35,083
but I do know He's not
gonna send that little girl to hell.

862
01:21:35,152 --> 01:21:38,519
Then I'm going to hell
because it's all my fault.

863
01:21:38,589 --> 01:21:42,287
Don't you think that even for a minute.

864
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:44,988
But it is.

865
01:21:45,063 --> 01:21:49,295
I didn't invite her
to go to the museum with me.

866
01:21:49,367 --> 01:21:52,700
I didn't wanna invite her.

867
01:21:52,770 --> 01:21:56,069
I wasn't there to go with her.

868
01:21:56,141 --> 01:21:59,269
- It's my fault.
- No, no, no, no.

869
01:21:59,344 --> 01:22:01,505
It's not your fault.

870
01:22:01,579 --> 01:22:04,207
None of that makes it so.

871
01:22:04,282 --> 01:22:06,478
It's a terrible thing.

872
01:22:06,552 --> 01:22:11,182
It doesn't make any sense,
but it's not your fault, Jess.

873
01:22:16,228 --> 01:22:19,891
She brought you something special
when she came here, didn't she?

874
01:22:23,068 --> 01:22:25,468
That's what you hold on to.

875
01:22:28,541 --> 01:22:31,032
That's how you keep her alive.

876
01:22:51,298 --> 01:22:52,629
May Belle?

877
01:23:01,375 --> 01:23:02,740
Look.

878
01:23:04,545 --> 01:23:06,410
I'm sorry I pushed you.

879
01:23:08,616 --> 01:23:11,881
That was stupid and wrong...

880
01:23:13,988 --> 01:23:16,081
...and I really miss you talking to me.

881
01:23:56,499 --> 01:23:58,933
She's in your hands now.

882
01:24:22,192 --> 01:24:23,318
Hey!

883
01:24:25,162 --> 01:24:26,424
Wait!

884
01:24:28,499 --> 01:24:29,523
Wait!

885
01:24:31,835 --> 01:24:33,234
Hey!

886
01:24:39,176 --> 01:24:42,236
Jess? I'm sorry.
I didn't... I didn't see you.

887
01:24:42,313 --> 01:24:46,080
Can I use the lumber by your house?

888
01:24:46,151 --> 01:24:47,846
Yeah, yeah. Of course.

889
01:24:47,919 --> 01:24:50,649
Anything you see, you just...

890
01:24:51,523 --> 01:24:54,890
You know, I meant to...
I meant to give you Prince Terrien,

891
01:24:54,959 --> 01:24:58,190
but I... can't seem to give him up.

892
01:25:00,031 --> 01:25:02,090
Leslie would've wanted you to have him.

893
01:25:02,167 --> 01:25:03,725
Yeah.

894
01:26:27,221 --> 01:26:30,589
We're playing. By ourselves.

895
01:26:32,127 --> 01:26:36,086
OK, but I know the most
incredible place to play.

896
01:26:36,165 --> 01:26:39,225
You gotta promise you're
not gonna tell anybody about it.

897
01:26:39,301 --> 01:26:43,431
Not Brenda, not Ellie, not even Joycie.

898
01:26:43,505 --> 01:26:47,100
Tell Joycie a secret between you and me?

899
01:26:47,176 --> 01:26:48,700
She's nothing but a baby.

900
01:26:48,777 --> 01:26:52,042
You're right, and she's not ready
to be a princess yet.

901
01:26:52,114 --> 01:26:53,979
You have to train her and stuff.

902
01:26:54,049 --> 01:26:57,076
Princess? Who gets to be the princess?

903
01:27:06,863 --> 01:27:08,592
Step down.

904
01:27:12,068 --> 01:27:13,467
Watch your step.

905
01:27:21,010 --> 01:27:22,808
You're not peeking, are you?

906
01:27:24,915 --> 01:27:27,713
Step up. There you go.

907
01:27:35,125 --> 01:27:36,922
All right.

908
01:27:43,367 --> 01:27:45,335
OK. Open them.

909
01:27:51,109 --> 01:27:55,170
Wow. Did you make this?

910
01:27:56,615 --> 01:27:58,310
Yep.

911
01:28:01,152 --> 01:28:02,949
Hold on a second.

912
01:28:11,630 --> 01:28:14,998
Look! They must've heard the rumor,

913
01:28:15,067 --> 01:28:19,834
that the beautiful girl arriving today
is the new future ruler of Terabithia.

914
01:28:19,906 --> 01:28:23,239
- Who heard?
- The Terabithians.

915
01:28:23,309 --> 01:28:25,573
They've been waiting.

916
01:28:25,645 --> 01:28:27,636
Where?

917
01:28:27,713 --> 01:28:31,171
- I don't see them.
- It's an ancient forest, May Belle,

918
01:28:31,250 --> 01:28:33,650
full of magical creatures
and friendly giants,

919
01:28:33,719 --> 01:28:36,017
anything you can imagine.

920
01:28:36,088 --> 01:28:38,056
But you gotta look really hard.

921
01:28:38,124 --> 01:28:41,026
But keep your mind wide open.

922
01:28:49,670 --> 01:28:51,501
So, what do you think?

923
01:28:55,909 --> 01:28:58,343
Can there be purple flowers?

924
01:29:00,447 --> 01:29:02,881
Anything you want.

925
01:29:03,850 --> 01:29:05,841
Wow.

926
01:29:07,255 --> 01:29:08,552
And a castle.

927
01:29:08,623 --> 01:29:11,421
A big one, with towers and flags.

928
01:29:11,492 --> 01:29:13,824
Of course.

929
01:29:16,631 --> 01:29:19,464
Look, Jess. It's beautiful.

930
01:29:23,371 --> 01:29:25,066
Is there a king?

931
01:29:25,139 --> 01:29:26,572
Are you the king, Jess?

932
01:29:26,641 --> 01:29:29,235
Only if you're princess.

933
01:30:14,824 --> 01:30:17,190
Terabithia.

934
