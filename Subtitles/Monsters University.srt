1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:01,516
<i>The neck bone's connected</i>

3
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:02,955
<i>To the head bone</i>

4
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,601
<i>The head bone's connected
to the horn bone</i>

5
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,276
<i>The horn bone's right above
the wing bones</i>

6
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,595
- I scared you!
- No, you didn't.

7
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,639
Okay! Remember our field trip rules,
everyone.

8
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:20,441
No pushing, no biting,
and no fire breathing!

9
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:22,560
What did I just say?

10
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,161
Eighteen, nineteen...

11
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:26,437
Okay, we're missing one.
Who are we missing?

12
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:29,953
Mike Wazowski.

13
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:31,951
Thanks, Joe.

14
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:33,794
Good luck finishing
your crossword puzzle.

15
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:36,954
- Sorry, Michael. I didn't see you.
- That's okay.

16
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,636
When I was on the bus, I found a nickel!

17
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,395
I wish I had pockets.

18
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:44,520
Okay, everyone, partner up.
Get your field trip buddy.

19
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,879
Jeremy! You and me? Okay, no biggie.

20
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:53,001
Hailey? No? Pairing up with Claire?
Great choice. She's a good egg.

21
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,396
Russell.

22
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:56,879
Mike? Wazowski?

23
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:58,996
We car-pool?

24
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,873
- We're cousins.
- Hey!

25
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:04,078
Okay. Good catching up.

26
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:07,040
Well, Michael, it looks like
it's you and me again.

27
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,474
Come on, Karen. We're falling behind.

28
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,240
Please don't call me Karen.

29
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:23,160
<i>Now, stay close together.</i>

30
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:26,235
We're entering a very dangerous area.

31
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:29,081
Welcome to the Scare Floor.

32
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:36,436
This is where
we collect the Scream Energy

33
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,433
to power our whole world.

34
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:41,719
And can anyone tell me
whose job it is to go get that scream?

35
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,112
- Scarers!
- That's right!

36
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,591
Now, which one of you can
give me the scariest roar?

37
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:47,916
Me, me, me!

38
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:51,671
Sir! Right here!
Little green guy, two o'clock!

39
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,320
No, it's like this.

40
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,755
Hey, guys, watch this one.

41
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:55,911
Hey, I got a really good...

42
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:14,190
Whoa.

43
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:18,281
Well, hey there, kids.
Are you on a tour with your school?

44
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:19,391
- Yeah!
- Yes.

45
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:23,475
We're here to learn about Scream
Energy and what it takes to be a Scarer.

46
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:27,715
Well, hey, you're in luck,
because I just happen to be a Scarer.

47
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:29,832
I learned everything
I know from my school,

48
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:31,640
Monsters University.

49
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,990
Whoa.

50
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:34,311
It's the best Scaring School there is.

51
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,597
You wish! Fear Tech's the best.

52
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:40,631
Okay. You guys watch us and tell me
which school's the best. All right?

53
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,276
MU is.

54
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:46,441
Let's go, everybody!

55
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:48,160
<i>West coast coming online.</i>

56
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:49,880
<i>Scarers coming out.</i>

57
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:51,356
Oops. Stop right there.

58
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,354
Don't cross over that safety line.

59
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:56,081
Human children are extremely toxic.

60
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,760
Look at that!

61
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:01,151
Whoa! Hey, guys, watch the eye! Ow!

62
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:02,635
Look at that! It's amazing!

63
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,950
I know!

64
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,511
Excuse me. Fellas.

65
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,037
How about we do
tallest in the back?

66
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:12,680
Look, he's going to do a real Scare!

67
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,636
- Cool. I want to be a Scarer.
- Yeah. Me, too.

68
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:18,956
Come on, guys. I want to see.

69
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:23,121
Out of the way, Wazowski.
You don't belong on a Scare Floor.

70
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:34,236
Brian! Do not step over the line.

71
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:37,154
Mrs. Graves,
Michael went over the line.

72
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,473
Michael!

73
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,194
See? I told you. He's fine.

74
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,558
Well, I thought I heard something.

75
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:46,791
What?

76
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,794
Are you okay?

77
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,958
You could have gotten hurt!

78
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:57,791
I don't understand
how this could happen!

79
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:02,953
That was real dangerous, kid.
I didn't even know you were in there.

80
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:09,998
Wow. I didn't even know
you were in there.

81
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,235
Not bad, kid.

82
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:17,552
Michael, what do you have
to say for yourself?

83
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:23,200
How do I become a Scarer?

84
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,954
Monsters University!
Anybody getting off?

85
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:21,032
Well, everyone,
I don't mean to get emotional,

86
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,636
but everything in my life
has led to this moment.

87
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,439
Let it not be
just the beginning of my dream

88
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,194
but the beginning of all of our dreams.

89
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:29,238
Gladys, promise me
you'll keep auditioning.

90
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:31,392
Marie, Mr. Right
is out there somewhere.

91
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:33,831
Phil, keep using the ointment
till that thing goes away.

92
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:36,636
I wish you all the best.
Thank you all so much!

93
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:44,118
I'm welling up with tears. Now, get off.

94
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,640
Hello. How are you doing?

95
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,594
Stroke! Stroke!

96
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:35,231
Come on, put all you have into it!

97
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,475
Stroke! Stroke!

98
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:40,795
Okay! First thing on my list,

99
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:42,437
get registered.

100
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:44,638
Hey there, freshman. I'm Jay the R.A.,

101
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:47,520
and I'm here to say
that registration is thataway!

102
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:50,434
- Okay, Jay.
- Have a great first day.

103
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:53,361
Hey, I'm Kay!
Here's your orientation packet.

104
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,631
Thanks, Kay.

105
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:57,601
You can drop your bags off here
and get your picture taken with Trey.

106
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,394
- Say hooray!
- Hooray!

107
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,316
I can't believe it.

108
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:04,520
I'm officially a college student!

109
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:06,354
Okay, everyone, I'm Fay,

110
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:09,912
and I'll be giving you your
orientation tour on this perfect day!

111
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:16,318
Here are the labs where students learn

112
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,597
to design and build the doors
to the Human World.

113
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,961
Looks like the professor is
about to test a door!

114
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:40,431
The MU cafeteria serves a full buffet,
three meals a day.

115
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:44,678
I personally believe we have
some of the best chefs in the world.

116
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:48,956
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

117
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:52,161
The campus offers
a wide variety of majors,

118
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:56,952
but the crown jewel of MU
is the Scaring School.

119
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,958
Welcome to the Debate Team.
We're happy to have you.

120
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:15,112
I disagree for the following reasons.

121
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:16,680
True happiness
is a theoretical construct...

122
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:21,551
Hey there! Keep your eye on the sky
at the Astronomy Club!

123
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:28,119
Hey, hey, hey!
Come join the Improv Club.

124
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:30,431
You'll wish you were a...
Never... Always...

125
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:31,511
Ah, dang it!

126
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:35,437
MU's Greek Council.
We sponsor the annual Scare Games.

127
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,396
The Scare what now?

128
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:40,753
The Scare Games!
A super-intense Scaring competition!

129
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:43,754
They're crazy dangerous,
so anything could happen.

130
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:46,640
A bunch of guys went
to the hospital last year!

131
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:49,231
- You could totally die.
- And it's worth it.

132
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:52,275
You get a chance to prove
that you are the best!

133
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,231
Cool.

134
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:56,191
Wazowski, Room 319.

135
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,833
You know, your roommate
is a Scaring major, too.

136
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:03,751
"Hello, I'm your roommate."
Oh, that's too bland.

137
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,759
Don't force it. Just let it happen.

138
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:10,034
Your lifelong best friend
is right behind this door.

139
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:18,840
Hey there. I'm your roomie.

140
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,560
Name's Randy Boggs. Scaring major.

141
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:23,350
Mike Wazowski, Scaring major.

142
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:25,320
I can tell we're going to be
best chums, Mike.

143
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:28,593
Take whichever bed you want.
I wanted you to have first dibs.

144
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:31,235
You just disappeared.

145
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:34,758
Sorry. If I do that in Scaring class,
I'll be a joke.

146
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:37,515
No, it's totally great. You got to use it.

147
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:38,955
- Really?
- Yeah, but lose the glasses.

148
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:40,720
They give it away.

149
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:50,477
Okay!

150
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:53,480
Unpack. Check. Hang posters. Check.

151
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:55,996
Now I just need to ace my classes,
graduate with honors,

152
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:57,510
and become the greatest Scarer ever.

153
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,913
Boy, I wish I had your confidence, Mike.

154
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,594
Aren't you even a little nervous?

155
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:03,240
Actually, no.

156
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:06,472
I've been waiting for this my whole life.

157
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:12,110
I just can't wait to get started.

158
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:30,958
Oh, man! I can't be late on the first day!

159
00:12:58,790 --> 00:12:59,791
Wow.

160
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:18,435
You got to be kidding me.

161
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:20,401
I'm so nervous!

162
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,835
Relax. It will be fine.

163
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:22,957
Good morning, students.

164
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,359
Welcome to Scaring 101.

165
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:27,355
I am Professor Knight.

166
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:31,072
Now I'm sure all of you
were the scariest monster in your town.

167
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:34,554
Well, bad news, kids.
You're in my town now,

168
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:36,951
and I do not scare easily.

169
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:51,594
Dean Hardscrabble.
This is a pleasant surprise.

170
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,031
She's a legend.

171
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:59,592
She broke the all-time Scare Record
with the scream in that very can!

172
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,634
I don't mean to interrupt.

173
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:04,280
I just thought I'd drop by

174
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:07,877
to see the terrifying faces
joining my program.

175
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:11,271
Well, I'm sure my students
would love to hear

176
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:13,199
a few words of inspiration.

177
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:16,873
Inspiration? Very well.

178
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:23,431
Scariness is the true measure
of a monster.

179
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:24,875
If you're not scary

180
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:28,232
what kind of a monster are you?

181
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:33,359
It's my job to make
great students greater,

182
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:38,511
not make mediocre students
less mediocre.

183
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:43,036
That is why at the end of the semester
there will be a final exam.

184
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:49,351
Fail that exam and you are
out of the Scaring program.

185
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:57,719
So, I should hope
you're all properly inspired.

186
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,435
All right. All right.

187
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:09,516
Who can tell me the properties
of an effective roar?

188
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:11,391
Yes?

189
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:14,158
There are actually five.

190
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:16,358
Those include the roar's resonance,

191
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:18,592
the duration of the roar, and the...

192
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,196
Whoops. Sorry.

193
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:27,114
I heard someone say "roar,"
so I just kind of went for it.

194
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:29,074
Oh, excuse me, sorry.

195
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:31,721
I didn't mean to scare you there.
Hey, how you doing?

196
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:33,679
Very impressive, Mister...

197
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,479
Sullivan. Jimmy Sullivan.

198
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:36,877
Sullivan.

199
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:39,032
Like Bill Sullivan, the Scarer?

200
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:40,880
Yeah. He's my dad.

201
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:43,119
He's a Sullivan!

202
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:46,594
I should have known.
I expect big things from you.

203
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:49,311
Well, you won't be disappointed.

204
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,713
I'm sorry. Should I keep going?

205
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:54,231
No, no. Mr. Sullivan's covered it.

206
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:59,392
Everyone take out
your Scaring textbooks

207
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:01,313
and open them to chapter one.

208
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:03,392
Hey, bub. Can I borrow a pencil?

209
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:05,074
I forgot all my stuff.

210
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:08,279
All right. Yes.
There we go. That will get it.

211
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:10,001
Yeah.

212
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,354
Come on, Mike. It's a fraternity

213
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:14,911
and sorority party. We have to go!

214
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:17,516
If we flunk that Scaring final,
we are done.

215
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,231
I'm not taking any chances.

216
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:20,715
You've got
the whole semester to study,

217
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:24,351
but this might be our only chance
to get in good with the cool kids.

218
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:26,159
That's why I made these cupcakes.

219
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:28,518
That could have been embarrassing.

220
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:31,073
When I'm a Scarer,
life will be a nonstop party.

221
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,276
Stay out of trouble, wild man.

222
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:33,397
Wild man.

223
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:47,511
What the...

224
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:51,233
Archie!

225
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:55,511
Hey! What are you...

226
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:59,115
Wait... You're shushing me?
Hey! Hey! You can't...

227
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:02,121
- Where did he go?
- He's dead meat.

228
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:04,272
- That guy's in big trouble.
- Yeah, he is.

229
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,833
Hey, guys! Over here!

230
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:09,641
Fear Tech dummies.

231
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:13,631
- Sorry about that, buddy.
- Why are you in my room?

232
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:14,871
Your room? This is my...

233
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,914
This is not my room.

234
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:19,116
Archie! Come here, boy.

235
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:20,237
Archie?

236
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:22,438
Archie the Scare Pig.
He's Fear Tech's mascot.

237
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:23,996
Why is it here?

238
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:26,277
I stole it. Going to take it to the RORs.

239
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:27,431
The what?

240
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:31,117
Roar Omega Roar.
The top fraternity on campus.

241
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:33,557
They only accept the highly elite.

242
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:35,310
Okay, I'll lift the bed, you grab the pig.

243
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:37,350
- Ready? One, two, three.
- What? No, no... What...

244
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:38,551
That's it. Don't let go.

245
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,876
Careful. He's a biter.

246
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:44,231
Whoa! Whoa, hey... Whoa!

247
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:47,757
<i>L</i> got him!

248
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:54,159
That was awesome!

249
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:57,200
What am I doing? James P. Sullivan.

250
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,760
Mike Wazowski.

251
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:00,681
Listen, it was quite delightful
meeting you

252
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:01,991
and whatever that is,

253
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:04,118
but if you don't mind,
I have to study my Scaring.

254
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:06,961
You don't need to study Scaring.
You just do it.

255
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:09,591
Really? I think there's
a little more to it than that.

256
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,440
But, hey, thanks for stopping by.

257
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:12,955
Let go of that!

258
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:15,756
"My hat!
'MY Pig!

259
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:21,115
Hey! Come here!

260
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:23,272
Hey!

261
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:24,471
Catch it!

262
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:26,631
Come back here!

263
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:28,836
Yeah!

264
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:30,639
Ride it to frat row!

265
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:35,601
<i>Tentacles and serpent's wings,
they...</i>

266
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:36,671
Hey!

267
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:54,393
Go, go, go!

268
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:55,471
Hey...

269
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:57,399
Come on! Hey!

270
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:58,717
Cupcake?

271
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,035
Got it!

272
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:30,871
Fear Tech's mascot! MU rules!

273
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:37,674
M-U! M-U! M-U!

274
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:40,752
Did you see him catch that pig?

275
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:42,958
You are Jaws Theta Chi material,
freshman.

276
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,191
Thanks. I don't know...

277
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:46,432
No, no, no. He's an Omega Howl guy.

278
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:48,956
- Back off. We saw him first.
- No way. We did!

279
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:51,397
I'll take it from here, gentlemen.

280
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:55,279
Johnny Worthington,
president of Roar Omega Roar.

281
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:57,036
What's your name, big blue?

282
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:59,073
Jimmy Sullivan. Friends call me Sulley.

283
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:01,671
This guy's a Sullivan?
Like the famous Sullivan?

284
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,400
I can't believe it! That is crazy!

285
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,040
- Chet, calm down.
- I'm sorry.

286
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:08,000
Sulley, any freshman with the guts
to pull off a stunt like that

287
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:10,517
has got "Future Scarer"
written all over him.

288
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:13,077
Hey, did you see me ride the pig?
That took guts.

289
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:15,677
Slow down, squirt.
This party is for Scare students only.

290
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:19,116
Sorry, killer,
but you might want to hang out

291
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,874
with someone a little more your speed.

292
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:22,759
They look fun!

293
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:25,352
Hey there. Want to join Oozma Kappa?

294
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:26,631
We have cake.

295
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,521
Go crazy.

296
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:33,638
Is that a joke?

297
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:36,395
Sulley, talk to your friend.

298
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:38,632
He's not really my friend, but sure.

299
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:40,951
You heard him.
This is a party for Scare students.

300
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:42,676
I am a Scare student.

301
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,833
I mean for Scare students who actually,

302
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:46,952
you know, have a chance.

303
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:48,635
Aw, snap!

304
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:51,477
My chances are just as good as yours.

305
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,439
You're not even
in the same league with me.

306
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,436
Just wait, hotshot.

307
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:57,797
I'm going to scare circles
around you this year.

308
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,992
Okay. I'd like to see that.

309
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:03,441
Don't worry. You will.

310
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:09,957
Ready position.

311
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:11,750
Common crouch.

312
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:15,960
I want to see matted fur
and yellow teeth. Basic snarl.

313
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:18,079
Show me some slobber.

314
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:20,318
Drool is a tool, kids. Use it.

315
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:24,357
Now here is a monster
who looks like a Scarer.

316
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:27,831
You want a hope of passing
this class, you better eat,

317
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:30,157
breathe, and sleep Scaring.

318
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,231
Yeah!

319
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,436
Give me another one.

320
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:00,871
- Fear of spiders.
- Arachnophobia.

321
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:02,271
- Fear of thunder.
- Keraunophobia.

322
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:04,312
- Fear of chopsticks!
- Consecotaleophobia.

323
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:06,231
What is this, kindergarten?
Give me a hard one.

324
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:10,320
Go Monsters U!
You know what to do!

325
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:21,356
The answer is C, fangs.

326
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:22,757
Well done, Mr. Wazowski.

327
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:24,760
- A bowl of spiders!
- Correct!

328
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:26,953
- A clown running in the dark!
- Right again.

329
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:29,113
Warts, boils, and moles, in that order.

330
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:30,635
Outstanding!

331
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:22,671
Ogre slump.

332
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,036
Zombie snarl.

333
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:26,278
Dominant silverback gorilla.

334
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:29,240
That is some remarkable
improvement, Michael.

335
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:34,592
One frightening face does not
a Scarer make, Mr. Sullivan.

336
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:50,554
A Tauntaun Grimace
with Extra Slobber.

337
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,150
- You got it!
- That's what I'm saying.

338
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:55,435
I am going to wipe the floor
with that little know-it-all.

339
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:57,080
Yes, you are, big blue.

340
00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:59,120
Hey, wait. What are you guys...

341
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,875
It's just a precaution.

342
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:03,112
RORs are the best Scarers
on campus, Sullivan.

343
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:05,310
Can't have a member getting
shown up by a beach ball.

344
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:06,790
I am on a roll.

345
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:08,396
I'm going to destroy that guy.

346
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:10,793
Well, then you'll get this back
right away.

347
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:14,192
It's time to start delivering
on that Sullivan name.

348
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:20,681
Today's final will judge your ability
to assess a child's fear

349
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:24,920
and perform the appropriate Scare
in the Scare Simulator.

350
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:33,121
The Child Sensitivity Level
will be raised

351
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:36,114
from Bed-wetter to Heavy Sleeper,

352
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:38,796
so give it everything you've got.

353
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:40,679
Dean Hardscrabble is with us
this morning

354
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:43,512
to see who will be moving on
in the Scaring program

355
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,390
and who will not.

356
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:52,231
Let's get started.

357
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:57,195
I am a five-year-old girl
afraid of spiders and Santa Claus.

358
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:59,321
Which Scare do you use?

359
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:07,034
That's a Seasonal Creep and Crawl.

360
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:08,431
Demonstrate.

361
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:19,953
Results will be posted
outside my office. Next.

362
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:22,237
Focus.

363
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:25,399
Johnson, Crackle and Howl.
Yes!

364
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:41,675
Hey. Do you mind?

365
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:43,391
Don't mind at all.

366
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:49,754
Come on, Mike. Let's just move.

367
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,761
Stay out of my way.

368
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:57,198
Unlike you, I had to work hard
to get into the Scare program.

369
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:00,718
That's because you don't belong here.

370
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:11,601
That's what I thought.

371
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:16,070
I'm so sorry.

372
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:18,039
It was an accident.

373
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,479
What? This?

374
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:24,191
My one souvenir
from a lifetime of Scaring?

375
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:27,641
Accidents happen, don't they.

376
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:31,114
The important thing is no one got hurt.

377
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:34,478
You're taking this remarkably well.

378
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,232
Now, let's continue the exams.

379
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:42,398
Mr. Wazowski, I'm a five-year-old girl
on a farm in Kansas afraid of lightning.

380
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:44,155
Which Scare do you use?

381
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:47,034
Shouldn't I go up on the...

382
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:49,358
Which Scare do you use?

383
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:52,756
That is a Shadow Approach
with a Crackle Holler.

384
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:53,997
Demonstrate.

385
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:58,039
- Stop. Thank you.
- But I didn't get to...

386
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,555
I've seen enough.

387
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:02,116
I'm a seven-year-old boy...

388
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:06,151
I wasn't finished.

389
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:08,510
I don't need to know
any of that stuff to scare.

390
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:11,476
That "stuff" would've informed you

391
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:14,235
that this particular child
is afraid of snakes.

392
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:17,674
So a roar wouldn't make him scream,
it would make him cry,

393
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:20,640
alerting his parents,
exposing the monster world,

394
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:22,314
destroying life as we know it,

395
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:24,154
and of course we can't have that.

396
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:26,358
So I'm afraid I cannot
recommend that you continue

397
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:29,001
in the Scaring program. Good day.

398
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:31,198
Wait, what? But I'm a Sullivan.

399
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:35,954
Well then, I'm sure your family
will be very disappointed.

400
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:54,677
And, Mr. Wazowski,
what you lack is something

401
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:56,400
that cannot be taught.

402
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:59,400
You're not scary.

403
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:04,600
You will not be continuing
in the Scaring program.

404
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:08,476
Please. Let me try the simulator.
I'll surprise you.

405
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:12,996
Surprise me? I doubt that very much.

406
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:26,271
<i>Welcome back.</i>

407
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:30,116
<i>I hope everyone had a pleasant break.</i>

408
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:35,873
Some say that a career
as a scream-can designer is boring,

409
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:40,672
unchallenging, a waste
of a monster's potential.

410
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:46,439
Open your textbooks to chapter three.

411
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:49,480
We will now plunge into the rich history

412
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:51,991
of scream-can design.

413
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:39,150
Out of my way!

414
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:41,799
Coming through! Sorry.

415
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:46,715
<i>Welcome to this year's
Greek Scare Games kickoff.</i>

416
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:49,476
<i>The Scare Games! Yeah!</i>

417
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:52,632
<i>Okay, relax.</i>

418
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:56,795
<i>We have a special guest,
the founder of the games,</i>

419
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:59,111
<i>Dean Hardscrabble.</i>

420
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,191
<i>Good afternoon.</i>

421
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:07,558
<i>As a student, I created these games
as a friendly competition,</i>

422
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:10,232
<i>but be prepared.</i>

423
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:11,800
<i>To take home the trophy,</i>

424
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:15,238
<i>you must be the most fearsome
monsters on campus.</i>

425
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:20,396
<i>So good luck,
and may the best monsters win.</i>

426
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:21,756
<i>All right, everybody.</i>

427
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:23,870
<i>We're closing down sign-ups,
so we'll see you all...</i>

428
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:25,231
Wait!

429
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:28,476
I'm signing up!

430
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:31,881
What?

431
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:35,593
<i>You have to be
in a fraternity to compete.</i>

432
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:39,198
Behold the next winning fraternity
of the Scare Games,

433
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:43,998
the brothers, my brothers,
of Oozma Kappa!

434
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:47,115
Hi.

435
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:51,238
Mr. Wazowski, what are you doing?

436
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:53,831
You just said the winners are the most
fearsome monsters on campus.

437
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:56,396
If I win, it means
you kicked out the best Scarer

438
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:58,195
in the whole school.

439
00:31:58,270 --> 00:31:59,351
That won't happen.

440
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:01,395
How about a little wager?

441
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:04,874
If I win, you let me back
in the Scaring program.

442
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:08,919
And what would that prove?

443
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:10,756
That you were wrong.

444
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:15,791
Very well.

445
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:21,036
If you win, I will let your entire team
into the Scare program.

446
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:25,237
But if you lose,

447
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:27,756
you will leave Monsters University.

448
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:32,995
Deal.

449
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:36,631
Now all you need to do is find
enough members to compete.

450
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:37,711
We need six guys, right?

451
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:38,791
<i>Sorry, chief.</i>

452
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:42,478
<i>We count bodies, not heads.
That dude counts as one.</i>

453
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:46,152
Anybody else want to join our team?
Anyone at all?

454
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,356
Excuse me. Sorry. I'm late.

455
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:48,831
- Can I squeeze by you?
- Randy!

456
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:50,719
Randy, thank goodness.
I need you on my team.

457
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:53,596
Sorry. I'm already on a team.

458
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:54,671
Boggs.

459
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:56,991
I'm finally in with the cool kids, Mike.

460
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:58,674
Don't blow this for me.

461
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:01,356
Do the thing.

462
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:03,594
Where did he go?

463
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:04,917
Please, anybody.

464
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:07,197
I need one more monster.
Just one more!

465
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:09,274
<i>Yeah, sorry. Doesn't look good.</i>

466
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:11,796
<i>We have to move on.
Your team doesn't qualify.</i>

467
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:13,201
Yes, it does!

468
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:16,638
The star player has just arrived.

469
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:19,716
No way! Someone else!
Please! Anyone else.

470
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:22,590
<i>We're shutting down sign-ups, okay?
Is he on your team or not?</i>

471
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:26,715
Come on! Let's go!

472
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:30,514
Fine! Yes, he's on my team.

473
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:32,757
Good luck.

474
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:37,716
All right, Wazowski, what's the plan?

475
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:44,833
This is a fraternity house?

476
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:48,676
Hey there, teammateys!
Come on aboard!

477
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:51,672
As the president of Oozma Kappa,

478
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:54,481
it is my honor to welcome you
to your new home.

479
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:58,072
We call this room "Party Central."

480
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:00,478
Technically, we haven't
actually had a party here yet.

481
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:02,917
But when we do, we'll be ready!

482
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:13,677
The hot cocoa train is coming through!

483
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:15,593
Next stop... You!

484
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:17,718
I would like to start us off first by...

485
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:20,118
So, you guys are Scaring majors?

486
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:23,520
We were! None of us lasted very long.

487
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:26,992
I guess we just weren't what
old Hardscrabble was looking for.

488
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:29,072
Don Carlton, mature student.

489
00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:32,151
Thirty years in the textile industry

490
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:34,432
and then old dandy Don got downsized.

491
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:36,433
Figured I could throw myself
a pity party,

492
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:38,592
or go back to school
and learn the computers.

493
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:40,557
Hello. I'm Terry with a

494
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:43,600
And I'm Terri with an "I"!
I'm a dance major!

495
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:44,876
And I'm not.

496
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:46,873
Five, six, seven, eight!

497
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:49,351
Seven, eight, turn! And...
Why didn't you turn?

498
00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:51,194
Because we never agreed to do this!

499
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:53,950
- You said this was going to be cool!
- No one said this was gonna be cool.

500
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:55,270
- Now I'm embarrassed.
- Now you're embarrassed?

501
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:56,715
Yes, because it's in front of people!

502
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:58,201
You should wake up embarrassed.

503
00:34:58,270 --> 00:34:59,476
Hey, hey, hey!

504
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:02,714
I'm Art! New Age philosophy major.

505
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:05,031
Excited to live with you
and laugh with you,

506
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:07,395
and cry with you.

507
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:11,237
Thought you might like
to keep a dream journal.

508
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:14,710
Guess that leaves me.

509
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:16,235
My name's Scott Squibbles.

510
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:17,880
My friends call me Squishy.

511
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:20,112
I'm undeclared, unattached,

512
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:23,831
and unwelcome pretty much
everywhere but here.

513
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:26,551
Now that we've all been introduced,
as captain of our team...

514
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:29,281
So, basically, you guys have
no Scaring experience?

515
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:32,315
Not a lot! But now we've got you!

516
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:34,911
You're about the scariest fella
I've ever seen.

517
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:36,594
Even with them pink polka dots.

518
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:37,717
Thanks.

519
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:40,039
Actually, I think I bring
the whole package.

520
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:41,635
Your hands are as big as my face!

521
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:43,156
He's like a mountain with fur!

522
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:45,598
Come on. I don't even work out.

523
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:49,118
Yeah, me neither.
I don't want to get too big.

524
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:52,914
We thought our dreams were over,
but Mike said if we win,

525
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:54,630
they're letting us
in the Scaring program.

526
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:56,639
We're going to be real Scarers!

527
00:35:56,870 --> 00:35:58,599
- The best!
- You betcha!

528
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:00,320
Yeah! Right.

529
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:05,110
And here's what you've been
waiting for, fellas.

530
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:07,352
Your very own Oozma Kappa bedroom.

531
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:11,593
Great! We're sharing this room?

532
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,434
We'll let you guys get settled.

533
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:15,956
Anything you need,
you just give a big holler-oonie!

534
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:18,920
Okay, thanks, buddy.
Are you kidding me?

535
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:21,557
Look, they don't need to be good.
I'm going to carry the whole team.

536
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:23,998
Really? And who's going to carry you?

537
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:25,795
Hey, if you want to go back
to can design,

538
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:27,156
you know where the door is.

539
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:31,030
Great.

540
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:34,556
Guys?

541
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:36,881
Anybody home?

542
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:45,595
Hello?

543
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:47,437
Fellas?

544
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:58,158
Do you pledge your souls
to the Oozma Kappa brotherhood?

545
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:02,000
- Do you swear to keep secret...
- ...all that you learn here?

546
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:04,835
No matter how horrifying?

547
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:06,236
Hey!

548
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:08,473
Will you take the sacred oath of the...

549
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:10,558
- For crying out loud.
- Sweetie!

550
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:12,519
Turn the lights on
while you're down here!

551
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:14,080
You're going to ruin your eyes!

552
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:17,081
Mom! We're doing an initiation!

553
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:20,240
Scary. Well, carry on.

554
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:22,278
Just pretend I'm not here.

555
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:23,476
This is my mom's house.

556
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:27,272
Do you promise to look out
for your brothers...

557
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:31,679
...no matter what the peril?

558
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:38,081
Will you defend Oozma Kappa
no matter how dangerous?

559
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:41,518
No matter how insurmountable
the odds may be?

560
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:44,201
From evils both great and small?

561
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:46,557
In the face of unending pain and...

562
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:50,081
Forget it! You're in.

563
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:53,439
Look, we know we're no one's
first choice for a fraternity,

564
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:55,797
so it means a lot
to have you here with us.

565
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:59,761
Can't wait to start Scaring
with you, brothers.

566
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:10,639
- Time for a celebration!
- Yeah!

567
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:14,357
Grab the couch cushions, gentlemen,
because we're building a fort!

568
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:17,993
Mom, can we stay up late tonight?

569
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:36,721
I know you're a princess
and I'm just a stable boy.

570
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:39,600
Yuck!

571
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:43,478
- Mom! What are you doing?
- Your grubby paw was in my bed!

572
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:44,915
Were you kissing my hand?

573
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:47,800
No. And what about you
with all your shedding?

574
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:49,360
- I don't shed.
- Really.

575
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:51,351
Uh...

576
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:52,995
- Excuse me.
- I just want to get my stuff.

577
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:54,117
- Would you just...
- Hey. Come on!

578
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:55,601
...let me get my stuff!

579
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,595
First morning in the house.

580
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:02,394
That's going in the album!

581
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:05,360
- Guys! We got a letter!
- A letter?

582
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:06,920
We never get mail.

583
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:09,311
- Sorry. It's stuck.
- Would you... Give me that!

584
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:11,681
Tentacles. They're sticky.

585
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:13,957
It's the first event
of the Scare Games.

586
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:17,631
"A child's room is where you scare,

587
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:20,281
"but avoid the toxicity lurking there."

588
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:22,557
Wait a minute.
Where do they want us to meet?

589
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:30,034
Of all the sewers on campus,
this one has always been my favorite.

590
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:31,521
Art, you've been here before?

591
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:34,321
I have a life outside of the house,
you know.

592
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:39,473
Welcome to your worst nightmare,

593
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:41,075
the Scare Games!

594
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:45,713
Scare Games! Scare Games!

595
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:52,595
Yes! Yes, I love it!

596
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:54,515
I love this energy!

597
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:56,999
Okay. Okay, everybody.

598
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:59,641
Let's hear it
for the frats and sororities

599
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:02,078
competing in this year's games...

600
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:05,074
Jaws Theta Chi!

601
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:07,239
Python Nu Kappa!

602
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:08,631
Slugma Slugma Kappa!

603
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:12,117
Roar Omega Roar!

604
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:14,911
Eta Hiss Hiss!

605
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:19,320
And finally, Oozma Kappa.

606
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:26,481
Hi, Mom!

607
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:28,435
Smile!

608
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:32,157
Let's begin the first competition,

609
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:35,120
the Toxicity Challenge!

610
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:37,955
Human children are toxic!

611
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:41,872
And anything they touch is toxic.

612
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:44,078
We don't have any human toys,

613
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:46,791
but thanks to MU's biology department,

614
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:48,713
we found a close second,

615
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:53,154
the stinging glow urchin!

616
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:55,517
Trust me when I say,

617
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:57,479
you are not gonna
want to touch this bad boy!

618
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:58,791
I want to touch it.

619
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:02,234
And you certainly don't want
to touch any of its friends.

620
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:06,676
Yeah, I want to touch them.

621
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:08,719
This is the starting line.

622
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:12,078
The light at the end of the tunnel
is the finish line.

623
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:15,836
And whoever comes in last
is eliminated from the games.

624
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:18,674
- Mike...
- What is it?

625
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:19,997
Does that mean if we lose, we're out?

626
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:21,595
- Don't worry, Smoothie.
- Squishy!

627
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:23,195
Squishy. We're not going to lose,

628
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:26,996
because we have everything
we need to win right here.

629
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:28,711
Head.

630
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:30,754
No! Me. I'm going to win the race for us.

631
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:32,391
All right, all right. That's very cute,

632
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:34,512
but move, move, move.
I'm going to win this.

633
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:37,030
It's an obstacle course.
What are you going to do? Roar at it?

634
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:38,919
I can get through
faster than you, little guy.

635
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:42,751
Take your place at the starting line!

636
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:45,039
This is all about teamwork.

637
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:47,558
Everybody, stick together.

638
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:50,797
I'm going to beat you
over that finish line.

639
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:52,281
Get ready to eat my dust.

640
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:54,114
Hey, guys, should we huddle up?

641
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:57,799
Attention, teams. One last thing.

642
00:41:57,870 --> 00:41:59,713
Scarers work in the dark.

643
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:07,599
- I want to go home!
- On your marks...

644
00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:10,000
Hey, good luck, ladies.

645
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:12,835
Thanks! We're going to
rip you to pieces!

646
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:13,997
What?

647
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:17,271
...get set...

648
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:20,713
Go!

649
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:22,156
I'm going to touch them!

650
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:36,756
Come on!

651
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:41,796
Guys! We're falling behind a little!
Fellas!

652
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:45,311
Cheese and crackers!

653
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:46,721
Son of a moustache!

654
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:48,794
Salisbury steak, that hurts!

655
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:50,390
Is that as fast as you can go?

656
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:52,074
- Just getting started!
- What the...

657
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:00,950
That's got to hurt!

658
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:08,481
Terry!

659
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:10,360
Don't worry, we'll be...

660
00:43:28,470 --> 00:43:29,960
Yikes!

661
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:38,154
Roar Omega Roar wins!

662
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:53,833
Take that, Wazowski!

663
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:55,839
Are you delirious? I beat you!

664
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:57,356
Get your eye checked!

665
00:43:57,870 --> 00:43:58,871
Way to blow it, Oozmas!

666
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:00,994
Hey! Second place ain't bad.

667
00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:02,754
Second place, Jaws Theta Chi!

668
00:44:02,830 --> 00:44:03,831
What?

669
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:06,590
Your whole team
has to cross the finish line.

670
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:07,911
Third place, EEKs!

671
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:09,515
- Fourth place, PNKs!
- No.

672
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:11,920
- Fifth place, HSS!
- No, no, no!

673
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:13,196
And in last place,

674
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:15,873
Oozma Kappa.

675
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:19,558
I can't feel my anything.

676
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:23,999
Shocker! Oozma Kappa
has been eliminated!

677
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:25,836
No.

678
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:31,990
Don't look so surprised, Mr. Wazowski.

679
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,718
It would have taken a miracle
for you to...

680
00:44:35,950 --> 00:44:38,032
Attention, everyone.
We have an announcement.

681
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:41,034
Jaws Theta Chi has been disqualified.

682
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:46,675
The use of illegal protective gel
is cause for elimination.

683
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:48,036
What!

684
00:44:51,310 --> 00:44:54,120
Which means Oozma Kappa
is back in the games!

685
00:44:54,550 --> 00:44:56,075
It's a miracle!

686
00:44:57,030 --> 00:45:00,432
Your luck will run out, eventually.

687
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:09,232
This is going to be
harder than I thought.

688
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:14,831
Okay! Listen up, Oozmas.

689
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:16,878
Now, we're going to have to start
winning these things together,

690
00:45:17,390 --> 00:45:18,676
so that means I'm going to need

691
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:20,354
each of you guys
to pull your own weight.

692
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:21,670
- Mike?
- What is it?

693
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:24,037
We've made a list of
our strengths and weaknesses.

694
00:45:24,110 --> 00:45:27,319
In high school, I was
the master of the silent scare.

695
00:45:27,430 --> 00:45:31,833
I could sneak up on a field mouse
in a pillow factory.

696
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:34,197
Sorry! They get stickier
when I'm sweaty.

697
00:45:35,110 --> 00:45:36,919
Oh, my gosh, that's terrible.

698
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:40,278
We're experts in the ancient craft
of close-up magic.

699
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:45,160
It's all about misdirection.

700
00:45:46,630 --> 00:45:49,361
I have an extra toe.

701
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:50,591
Not with me, of course.

702
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:54,041
Guys, one slip-up on the next event,
and we're goners.

703
00:45:54,110 --> 00:45:55,191
So for this to work,

704
00:45:55,270 --> 00:45:57,955
I'm gonna need you
to take every instinct you have

705
00:45:58,030 --> 00:45:59,520
and bury it deep, deep down.

706
00:45:59,830 --> 00:46:01,912
- Done.
- From now on, we are of one mind.

707
00:46:01,990 --> 00:46:02,991
My mind.

708
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:04,151
Please.

709
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:06,470
I will tell you exactly what to do,
and how to do it.

710
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:08,633
Okay, Mike. Seems about right.

711
00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:10,196
All right. Give me scary steps.

712
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:12,193
Fifty up and down, right now. Let's go!

713
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:14,955
You're wasting your time.
We need a new team.

714
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:17,761
We can't just "get a new team"!

715
00:46:17,830 --> 00:46:19,671
I checked this morning.
It's against the rules.

716
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:21,559
What if we disguised a new team
to look like the old team?

717
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:23,474
No, no. We are not cheating.

718
00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:27,317
It's not cheating. I'm just, you know,
leveling the playing field.

719
00:46:29,270 --> 00:46:31,637
Okay, so it's kind of cheating,
but what do you want me to do?

720
00:46:31,710 --> 00:46:33,750
They're not exactly
the scariest group in the world.

721
00:46:33,990 --> 00:46:36,994
Oh, a ladybug!
Make a wish! Make a wish!

722
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:42,315
This is not going to work.

723
00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:44,040
Where are you going? We're training.

724
00:46:44,110 --> 00:46:45,157
I'm a Sullivan.

725
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:47,273
That's not enough.
You're all over the place.

726
00:46:47,350 --> 00:46:48,671
You're charging ahead when you...

727
00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:52,071
You tell them what to do but not me.

728
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:53,800
So long, Coach.

729
00:46:57,710 --> 00:46:59,121
Okay, Oozmas...

730
00:46:59,790 --> 00:47:01,076
Boy, we need to get you a bell.

731
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:04,831
Listen up. "if a kid hears you coming,
they'll call Mom or Dad,

732
00:47:04,910 --> 00:47:06,950
"then you'd better run fast
or things will get bad."

733
00:47:08,510 --> 00:47:10,353
In the next event,
if even one of us gets caught,

734
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:12,000
we're all out.

735
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:14,676
So remember, do exactly what I do.

736
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:26,633
We are at
the halfway point of the second event,

737
00:47:27,190 --> 00:47:29,557
and things are getting interesting.

738
00:47:33,190 --> 00:47:34,476
Got it.

739
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:36,796
Only two teams left.

740
00:47:37,550 --> 00:47:39,154
Who will make it out with their flag,

741
00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:40,874
and who will be eliminated?

742
00:47:40,950 --> 00:47:41,951
In a real Scare,

743
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:44,631
you do not want to get caught
by a kid's parent.

744
00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:47,839
And in this event,
you do not want to get caught by

745
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:49,390
the librarian.

746
00:47:52,550 --> 00:47:54,279
Quiet.

747
00:47:56,550 --> 00:47:58,552
What's so scary
about a little old librarian?

748
00:48:08,110 --> 00:48:10,397
I said, "Quiet."

749
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:36,673
- Faster.
- Slow and steady.

750
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:38,559
- Slow and steady.
- Slow and steady.

751
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:39,677
Slow and steady.

752
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:41,440
Slow and steady.

753
00:49:01,070 --> 00:49:03,118
- Sullivan!
- Sullivan!

754
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:43,354
No!

755
00:49:51,550 --> 00:49:54,156
Five, six, seven, eight!

756
00:49:54,230 --> 00:49:55,356
Look over here!

757
00:50:02,110 --> 00:50:04,078
- Is that legal?
- You better believe it, mop top!

758
00:50:04,230 --> 00:50:06,312
The only rule is don't get caught.

759
00:50:17,030 --> 00:50:18,520
Hey! Over here!

760
00:50:22,030 --> 00:50:23,634
- Come and get me!
- Come and get me!

761
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:24,757
Guys, what are you doing?

762
00:50:24,830 --> 00:50:25,991
They said don't let her catch you.

763
00:50:26,070 --> 00:50:27,595
But they didn't say how!

764
00:50:27,870 --> 00:50:29,270
Move it! Move it! Move it! Come on!

765
00:50:37,590 --> 00:50:38,591
We did it!

766
00:50:38,830 --> 00:50:41,436
No, we didn't. We forgot the flag!

767
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:42,921
Mike?

768
00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:46,994
'Way to 90, Squishy!
'Way to 90, Squishy!

769
00:50:47,230 --> 00:50:48,311
How?

770
00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:50,393
Misdirection.

771
00:50:56,870 --> 00:50:58,838
The EEKs have been eliminated

772
00:50:58,910 --> 00:51:02,232
and Oozma Kappa live
to scare another day!

773
00:51:02,590 --> 00:51:05,912
We're OK! We're OK! We're OK!

774
00:51:10,590 --> 00:51:12,194
I've never felt so alive!

775
00:51:12,270 --> 00:51:13,351
We were awesome!

776
00:51:13,430 --> 00:51:15,637
Okay, look. That wasn't real Scaring.

777
00:51:16,110 --> 00:51:17,390
It was better than what you did.

778
00:51:17,430 --> 00:51:18,841
You should've stuck to my strategy.

779
00:51:19,150 --> 00:51:20,151
Whatever.

780
00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:21,880
Talk to me when we start
the real Scaring.

781
00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:25,751
Hey! You guys going to the party?

782
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:27,994
I think you've got the wrong guys.

783
00:51:28,070 --> 00:51:30,038
- We don't get invited to...
- Party?

784
00:51:30,110 --> 00:51:31,874
The mid-games mixer at the RORs'.

785
00:51:31,950 --> 00:51:33,998
It's for the top Scare Teams.

786
00:51:34,070 --> 00:51:35,196
You're one of us now, right?

787
00:51:36,630 --> 00:51:37,756
See you there!

788
00:51:39,030 --> 00:51:41,032
- Did you hear that?
- I can't believe it!

789
00:51:41,110 --> 00:51:42,919
- Bad idea.
- This is great.

790
00:51:42,990 --> 00:51:46,597
They're finally seeing us
as real Scarers. We're going!

791
00:51:49,950 --> 00:51:51,793
Do young people still dance?

792
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:53,555
Because my moves are a little rusty.

793
00:51:53,630 --> 00:51:55,519
We forgot to bring a hostess gift.

794
00:51:55,590 --> 00:51:57,550
We can't go in there
without some scented candles.

795
00:51:57,590 --> 00:52:00,116
Calm down. We earned this.

796
00:52:00,430 --> 00:52:02,194
What if there's
a lull in the conversation?

797
00:52:02,270 --> 00:52:04,272
I never know what to... You know...

798
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:05,471
Say?

799
00:52:05,710 --> 00:52:07,121
How are you so good at this?

800
00:52:07,310 --> 00:52:09,312
You just took on
an angry 50-foot librarian,

801
00:52:09,390 --> 00:52:11,279
and you're afraid of a little party?

802
00:52:11,350 --> 00:52:12,590
Take a deep breath...

803
00:52:13,990 --> 00:52:15,071
...and in you go!

804
00:52:23,750 --> 00:52:24,797
Hello.

805
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:27,671
- It's Oozma Kappa!
- These guys are crazy!

806
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:29,912
What you did today was insane!

807
00:52:29,990 --> 00:52:31,151
That was awesome!

808
00:52:35,510 --> 00:52:38,320
Oozma Kappa,
tonight we party like Scarers!

809
00:53:00,830 --> 00:53:03,595
I've never stayed up this late in my life!

810
00:54:15,790 --> 00:54:18,191
Hey, quiet! Quiet!

811
00:54:18,910 --> 00:54:20,435
Quiet down, you can-wranglers.

812
00:54:20,950 --> 00:54:22,952
All right. On behalf of the RORs,

813
00:54:23,270 --> 00:54:26,638
we'd like to congratulate all the teams
that have made it this far.

814
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:30,031
All, right, let's hear it for the PNKs!

815
00:54:30,950 --> 00:54:33,191
I love that trick! Never gets old. HSS!

816
00:54:34,910 --> 00:54:35,911
Very creepy-

817
00:54:35,990 --> 00:54:40,279
And finally, the surprise team
of the Scare Games,

818
00:54:41,030 --> 00:54:42,156
Oozma Kappa!

819
00:54:42,550 --> 00:54:43,711
Come on over, guys.

820
00:54:45,710 --> 00:54:47,121
Now, I got to admit, fellas,

821
00:54:47,470 --> 00:54:49,632
I thought you were a bunch of nobodies.

822
00:54:50,590 --> 00:54:51,921
But, boy, was I wrong.

823
00:54:52,390 --> 00:54:54,279
Let's hear it for Oozma Kappa!

824
00:54:54,430 --> 00:54:56,478
Oozma Kappa!

825
00:54:56,550 --> 00:54:57,676
Oh!

826
00:54:59,310 --> 00:55:00,311
What?

827
00:55:00,550 --> 00:55:03,554
The most adorable monsters
on campus.

828
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:14,400
Release the stuffed animals.

829
00:55:18,990 --> 00:55:19,991
Faced!

830
00:55:24,270 --> 00:55:27,592
Don't worry.
Nobody reads the school paper.

831
00:55:27,670 --> 00:55:30,196
Yeah, but I'm pretty sure
they read the quad.

832
00:55:48,190 --> 00:55:49,237
Thank you very much.

833
00:55:49,310 --> 00:55:50,880
Okay. Would you like that
with two sleeves or four?

834
00:55:50,950 --> 00:55:52,190
Thanks. Tell your friends.

835
00:55:53,270 --> 00:55:54,795
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

836
00:55:54,870 --> 00:55:56,270
Raising a little money for charity.

837
00:55:56,390 --> 00:55:57,596
Yeah? Well, stop it.

838
00:55:57,870 --> 00:56:00,271
You want us to stop raising money
for charity? That's not cool.

839
00:56:00,350 --> 00:56:01,715
This guy hates charity!

840
00:56:02,390 --> 00:56:04,757
I want you to stop making us
look like fools.

841
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:07,721
Hey, you're making yourselves
look like fools.

842
00:56:08,110 --> 00:56:09,555
Let's be honest, boys.

843
00:56:09,630 --> 00:56:11,598
You're never going to be real Scarers,

844
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:14,480
because real Scarers look like us.

845
00:56:16,510 --> 00:56:19,832
But, hey, if you really want
to work for a Scare company

846
00:56:20,270 --> 00:56:23,080
they're always hiring in the mailroom.

847
00:56:28,790 --> 00:56:29,757
Guys, hold on!

848
00:56:30,710 --> 00:56:33,395
Hey, hey, hey! Wait a second.
Don't listen to him.

849
00:56:33,630 --> 00:56:35,200
We just need to keep trying.

850
00:56:35,430 --> 00:56:37,398
No, you need to stop trying!

851
00:56:37,470 --> 00:56:39,837
You can train monsters like this
all you want,

852
00:56:39,910 --> 00:56:41,435
but you can't change who they are.

853
00:56:47,430 --> 00:56:48,431
Mike...

854
00:56:49,110 --> 00:56:52,592
We appreciate everything you've done,
but he's right.

855
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:58,281
No matter how much we train,
we'll never look like them.

856
00:57:00,790 --> 00:57:01,791
We're built

857
00:57:03,270 --> 00:57:04,396
for other things.

858
00:57:16,670 --> 00:57:17,717
Sorry, squirt!

859
00:57:17,790 --> 00:57:20,157
Some monsters just aren't
cut out for the big leagues.

860
00:57:23,910 --> 00:57:25,321
The big leagues.

861
00:57:26,030 --> 00:57:27,031
Guys.

862
00:57:28,710 --> 00:57:30,314
We're going on a little field trip.

863
00:57:40,270 --> 00:57:41,635
My tentacle fell asleep.

864
00:57:42,070 --> 00:57:43,674
- Thanks, Mom.
- Have fun, kids!

865
00:57:43,790 --> 00:57:46,475
I'll just be here listening to my tunes.

866
00:57:51,350 --> 00:57:53,796
Hey, where are we?

867
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:55,235
The big leagues.

868
00:58:03,670 --> 00:58:05,115
Holy rely-poly-

869
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:06,271
Wow.

870
00:58:06,350 --> 00:58:07,920
Nice fence.

871
00:58:07,990 --> 00:58:09,480
This is amazing, Mike.

872
00:58:10,150 --> 00:58:11,675
We're not stopping here.

873
00:58:24,870 --> 00:58:26,918
This is crazy.
We're going to get arrested!

874
00:58:36,510 --> 00:58:38,592
<i>AH Scare Floors now active.</i>

875
00:58:38,750 --> 00:58:42,436
<i>West coast coming online.
Scarers coming out.</i>

876
00:58:44,390 --> 00:58:45,391
Look at them.

877
00:58:45,670 --> 00:58:47,115
They're going into the human world,

878
00:58:47,310 --> 00:58:49,312
and they don't even look scared!

879
00:58:52,710 --> 00:58:53,836
Wow.

880
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:55,839
Take a good look, fellas.

881
00:58:56,430 --> 00:58:58,159
See what they all have in common?

882
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:02,400
No, not really.

883
00:59:02,470 --> 00:59:05,917
Exactly. There's no one type of Scarer.

884
00:59:06,310 --> 00:59:08,591
The best Scarers use their differences
to their advantage.

885
00:59:11,550 --> 00:59:14,156
- Wow.
- Terri? Look.

886
00:59:19,030 --> 00:59:20,077
Hey!

887
00:59:20,230 --> 00:59:22,915
Look at that old feller
racking up the big numbers!

888
00:59:22,990 --> 00:59:26,153
Don, that old fella is
Earl "The Terror" Thompson!

889
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:28,676
What? Where? That's really him?

890
00:59:28,750 --> 00:59:30,957
He held the Scare Record
for three years!

891
00:59:31,310 --> 00:59:33,153
Third door from the end!

892
00:59:33,230 --> 00:59:35,597
Carla "Killer Claws" Benitez!

893
00:59:35,670 --> 00:59:37,798
Look!
It's "Screaming" Bob Gunderson!

894
00:59:38,190 --> 00:59:39,830
- I still have his rookie card.
- Me, too!

895
00:59:39,870 --> 00:59:41,201
Doesn't have the speed anymore,
but his

896
00:59:41,270 --> 00:59:43,671
- technique is flawless.
- Technique is flawless.

897
00:59:45,030 --> 00:59:46,634
You collected Scare Cards, huh?

898
00:59:46,710 --> 00:59:48,474
Yep. 450 of them.

899
00:59:48,550 --> 00:59:51,360
Impressive.
I have 6,000 still in mint condition,

900
00:59:51,430 --> 00:59:52,991
but, you know, 450 is pretty good, too.

901
00:59:53,030 --> 00:59:55,351
Hey, look at me!
I'm Earl "The Terror" Thompson!

902
00:59:56,910 --> 00:59:58,116
That's great!

903
00:59:58,790 --> 01:00:00,758
That's a pretty good one, Squish.

904
01:00:04,710 --> 01:00:05,996
I've been a real jerk.

905
01:00:07,550 --> 01:00:08,756
So have I.

906
01:00:10,950 --> 01:00:12,076
But it's not too late.

907
01:00:13,550 --> 01:00:17,475
We could be a great team.
We just need to start working together.

908
01:00:19,830 --> 01:00:20,991
Hey!

909
01:00:21,990 --> 01:00:23,111
What are you doing up there?

910
01:00:23,710 --> 01:00:24,996
I can't go back to jail!

911
01:00:29,310 --> 01:00:30,311
Come on!

912
01:00:30,390 --> 01:00:31,801
They're right behind us!

913
01:00:35,910 --> 01:00:36,911
Get back here!

914
01:00:43,670 --> 01:00:44,831
Up there! Get them!

915
01:00:48,790 --> 01:00:50,474
- Thanks, brother!
- Don't mention it.

916
01:00:52,350 --> 01:00:56,435
I'm fine, really!
It's just a little heart attack.

917
01:00:56,910 --> 01:00:58,958
I want a piece of that action!

918
01:01:11,070 --> 01:01:12,276
Mom! Start the car!

919
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:15,593
- What?
- Start the car!

920
01:01:15,830 --> 01:01:17,036
Stop the bar?

921
01:01:17,230 --> 01:01:19,198
The car! Start the car!

922
01:01:19,430 --> 01:01:20,591
Okay.

923
01:01:22,790 --> 01:01:24,190
Come on, come on, come on, come on!

924
01:01:24,230 --> 01:01:25,231
Get in! Get in!

925
01:01:25,710 --> 01:01:27,553
- Mom, go!
- Seatbelts.

926
01:01:28,550 --> 01:01:30,791
- Okay, go!
- Does anyone want gum?

927
01:01:30,870 --> 01:01:31,871
Just drive!

928
01:01:32,550 --> 01:01:33,836
Okay. Here we go!

929
01:01:38,510 --> 01:01:41,753
Oh, yeah!
Let's break in somewhere else!

930
01:02:04,990 --> 01:02:06,833
Rise and shine!

931
01:02:07,270 --> 01:02:10,080
Scary feet, scary feet...
The kid is in the bathroom!

932
01:02:10,150 --> 01:02:12,039
Scary feet, scary feet...
Oh, he's back!

933
01:02:13,990 --> 01:02:14,991
Wake up!

934
01:02:15,670 --> 01:02:17,035
Thirty-seven! Thirty-eight!

935
01:02:17,430 --> 01:02:19,319
Do I hear thirty-nine?
Come on!

936
01:02:20,030 --> 01:02:21,873
Yes! Okay, Oozma Kappa,
you're looking good.

is the point of a Scare.

"If you frighten a teen,
then Scarer beware."

939
01:02:28,710 --> 01:02:31,077
Okay, scare the little kid.

940
01:02:31,150 --> 01:02:32,436
Avoid the teenager!

941
01:02:38,390 --> 01:02:39,801
I'm on the phone!

942
01:02:41,110 --> 01:02:42,157
No one understands me!

943
01:02:43,310 --> 01:02:44,357
Whatever.

944
01:02:50,590 --> 01:02:51,955
But, Daddy, I love him!

945

You got 10 seconds. Go!

Kiosk! Pile of leaves!
Standing out in the open.

And there should be one more.

954

HOW did I do?

955
01:03:28,270 --> 01:03:29,556
Not too shabby, Don!

956
01:03:29,910 --> 01:03:32,038
Thanks! I cannot get down.

In the morning.

That's what I'm talking about!

962
01:03:50,710 --> 01:03:52,678
Time to go to work.

You're out!

964
01:04:16,190 --> 01:04:17,271
You're out.

965
01:04:18,550 --> 01:04:20,552
Hey, tough luck, Kris Kringle.

966
01:04:33,070 --> 01:04:34,310
Thank you.

967
01:04:37,710 --> 01:04:38,916
Yeah!

968
01:04:39,550 --> 01:04:40,711
Yeah!

969
01:04:41,910 --> 01:04:43,116
<i>We're down to two remaining teams,</i>

970
01:04:43,190 --> 01:04:46,273
Roar Omega Roar and Oozma <i>Kappa!</i>

971
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:50,474
Which leads us to the final event!

972
01:04:50,590 --> 01:04:53,070
"Every one of your skills
will be put to the test.

973
01:04:53,390 --> 01:04:56,758
"The Scare Simulator will prove
who's the best!"

974
01:04:57,070 --> 01:04:59,437
Tomorrow night you finally get to Scare

975
01:04:59,710 --> 01:05:01,155
in front of the whole school!

976
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:03,881
Enjoy the attention while it lasts, boys.

977
01:05:04,550 --> 01:05:07,759
After you lose,
no one will remember you.

978
01:05:08,150 --> 01:05:11,950
Maybe. But when you lose,
no one will let you forget it.

979
01:05:13,110 --> 01:05:16,353
Oh, boy. That is a good point.

980
01:05:17,550 --> 01:05:18,995
Hey, Oozmas, you guys are awesome!

981
01:05:19,070 --> 01:05:21,038
You've got to teach us your moves.

982
01:05:21,110 --> 01:05:23,761
Well, then you're gonna
want to talk to this guy.

983
01:05:24,110 --> 01:05:26,078
Sure, I can teach you.

984
01:05:26,150 --> 01:05:27,720
All right. You want to hide
behind the chair?

985
01:05:27,790 --> 01:05:28,950
You have to become the chair.

986
01:05:29,910 --> 01:05:31,480
Thanks for coming, Dean.

987
01:05:33,390 --> 01:05:34,391
Dean Hardscrabble!

988
01:05:34,510 --> 01:05:37,161
If we get back into the Scaring program,

989
01:05:37,230 --> 01:05:38,516
I hope there's no hard feelings.

990
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:46,310
Tomorrow, each of you must prove
that you are undeniably scary.

991
01:05:47,910 --> 01:05:50,993
And I know for a fact
that one of you is not.

992
01:05:56,510 --> 01:05:58,319
No. He works harder than anyone.

993
01:05:58,590 --> 01:05:59,716
Do you think he's scary?

994
01:05:59,950 --> 01:06:01,440
He's the heart and soul of the team!

995
01:06:01,670 --> 01:06:03,638
Do you think he's scary?

996
01:06:15,830 --> 01:06:18,197
We're going to win this thing
tomorrow, Sull, I can feel it!

997
01:06:18,830 --> 01:06:20,912
We'll finally have our lives
back on track.

998
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:23,990
Hey. Mike?

999
01:06:24,070 --> 01:06:27,279
You know, you've given me
a lot of really great tips.

1000
01:06:27,350 --> 01:06:28,875
I'd love to return the favor sometime.

1001
01:06:29,550 --> 01:06:31,598
Yeah, sure. Anytime.

1002
01:06:33,910 --> 01:06:35,196
- We're doing this now?
- Okay.

1003
01:06:35,550 --> 01:06:38,952
You've memorized every textbook,
every Scare Theory, and that is great.

1004
01:06:39,030 --> 01:06:40,395
Hey!

1005
01:06:40,470 --> 01:06:42,199
But now it's time to forget all that.

1006
01:06:42,270 --> 01:06:45,319
Just reach deep down
and let the scary out!

1007
01:06:45,670 --> 01:06:47,195
Just feel it.

1008
01:06:47,510 --> 01:06:48,750
Exactly. Go wild.

1009
01:06:49,030 --> 01:06:51,192
I don't know. I've kind of
got my own technique.

1010
01:06:51,630 --> 01:06:52,631
Give it a try.

1011
01:06:54,710 --> 01:06:56,155
Good, but bigger!

1012
01:06:56,950 --> 01:06:59,112
Nope. You're thinking again.
From the gut!

1013
01:07:00,310 --> 01:07:01,596
Let the animal out!

1014
01:07:03,430 --> 01:07:04,875
Come on! Dig deep!

1015
01:07:06,430 --> 01:07:09,036
Boys! It's a school night!

1016
01:07:11,350 --> 01:07:13,034
So, how was that?

1017
01:07:14,430 --> 01:07:15,636
Up top.

1018
01:07:16,670 --> 01:07:20,152
You know, it did feel different!
I feel like it's all coming together.

1019
01:07:20,230 --> 01:07:23,154
Yup, this time tomorrow
the whole school is finally going to see

1020
01:07:23,230 --> 01:07:25,039
what Mike Wazowski can do.

1021
01:07:25,110 --> 01:07:26,680
You're darn right.

1022
01:07:33,670 --> 01:07:35,479

1029
01:08:00,590 --> 01:08:03,036
Yeah! All right!

1030
01:08:04,550 --> 01:08:06,951

<i>First Scarers to the starting line.</i>

1037
01:08:21,950 --> 01:08:24,556
Okay, just like we planned.
I'll go first. Then, Don...

1038
01:08:24,630 --> 01:08:26,678
Hold on. Mike's the one
who started all this

1039
01:08:27,230 --> 01:08:29,881
and I think it's only right
if he's the one who finishes it.

1040
01:08:30,510 --> 01:08:31,796
I think you should go last.

1041
01:08:32,110 --> 01:08:33,236
Yes!

1042
01:08:33,310 --> 01:08:34,350
Yeah, Mike. Finish strong!

1043
01:08:35,470 --> 01:08:38,201
All right. Don, you okay going first?

1044
01:08:38,270 --> 01:08:40,432
I guess I'm as ready as I'll ever be.

1045
01:08:41,030 --> 01:08:42,998
Oozma Kappa!

1046
01:08:43,190 --> 01:08:44,715
Go Oozmas!

1047
01:08:44,790 --> 01:08:46,519
I'm gonna do it.
I'm going to beat this guy.

1048
01:08:47,470 --> 01:08:49,711
Hey, Bruiser!
You take it easy on grandpa.

1049
01:08:50,990 --> 01:08:53,152
Unleash the beast, Don!

1050
01:08:53,830 --> 01:08:55,195
Okay, then.

1051
01:09:45,550 --> 01:09:47,791
Thanks for taking it easy on grandpa.

1052

<i>Next group to the starting line.</i>

1053

01:10:06,430 --> 01:10:07,591
Yes! Yeah!

1055
01:10:30,670 --> 01:10:31,831
- Come on, Art.
- Come on, buddy.

1056
01:10:31,910 --> 01:10:33,071
You can do it.

1057
01:10:44,790 --> 01:10:45,791
Yes!

<i>Next up, Sullivan and Boggs!</i>

1059

01:11:31,630 --> 01:11:34,156
<i>And it's all tied up!</i>

1061

01:11:39,990 --> 01:11:42,072
Way to 90, Boggs!

1064

That's the last time
I lose to you, Sullivan.

1065

<i>Worthington and Wazowski,
to the starting line.</i>

1066

Hey-

1067
01:12:00,830 --> 01:12:02,070
Don't worry about Hardscrabble.

1068
01:12:03,190 --> 01:12:04,760
Don't worry about anyone else.

1069
01:12:05,310 --> 01:12:08,678
Just go out there and show them
what Mike Wazowski can do.

1070
01:12:11,110 --> 01:12:12,271
Thanks.

1071
01:12:22,030 --> 01:12:24,237
Don't take the loss too hard.

1072
01:12:24,310 --> 01:12:26,119
You never belonged here anyway.

1073
01:12:55,470 --> 01:12:58,155
<i>Amazing
performance by Worthington!</i>

1074
01:12:58,390 --> 01:13:00,199
- Johnny, you're my hero!
- ROR! ROR!

1075
01:13:02,030 --> 01:13:06,274
<i>The Oozmas will need
a record-breaking Scare to win this.</i>

1076
01:13:08,310 --> 01:13:10,074
<i>You don't belong on a Scare Floor.</i>

1077

<i>No one will remember you.</i>

<i>Come on! Dig deep!</i>

1080
01:13:22,150 --> 01:13:24,152
Yeah!

1081
01:13:27,030 --> 01:13:28,191
<i>They did it!</i>

1082
01:13:46,470 --> 01:13:48,438
Yeah! Hey!

1083

We're in the Scare program! Yeah!

1084
01:13:56,950 --> 01:13:58,952
Come here, you son of a gun!

1085
01:13:59,030 --> 01:14:01,556
- Way to go!
- Yeah!

1086
01:14:01,630 --> 01:14:03,200
A little stuck.

1087
01:14:03,310 --> 01:14:04,914
Pardon me there, Ms. Squibbles.

1088
01:14:04,990 --> 01:14:07,311
It's Sherrie.

1089
01:14:08,470 --> 01:14:11,121
We did it!

1090
01:14:15,350 --> 01:14:16,636
Way to go, Oozma Kappa!

1091
01:14:16,710 --> 01:14:17,836
- Thank you!
- Thanks a lot.

1092
01:14:17,950 --> 01:14:20,715
- You rule!
- I have never ruled before.

1093
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:22,758
You guys killed it out there!

1094
01:14:22,870 --> 01:14:23,917
Awesome!

1095
01:14:23,990 --> 01:14:25,674
Hey, Wazowski!

1096
01:14:26,750 --> 01:14:29,321
Come on, let's go, you maniac!
We're celebrating.

1097
01:14:30,430 --> 01:14:31,556
Mike?

1098
01:14:31,950 --> 01:14:33,315
I did it.

1099
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:36,074
I can't believe it.

1100
01:14:37,670 --> 01:14:39,320
I'm going to be a Scarer!

1101
01:14:39,830 --> 01:14:41,036
Yeah, yes, you are.

1102
01:14:41,430 --> 01:14:43,432
You hear that? Get plenty of rest, kiddo.

1103
01:14:43,510 --> 01:14:46,434
You haven't seen the last
of Mike Wazowski. Boo!

1104
01:14:53,510 --> 01:14:57,071
I knew I was scary.
I didn't know I was that scary.

1105
01:14:57,150 --> 01:14:59,756
Yeah, we're so scary
I guess we broke it.

1106
01:14:59,830 --> 01:15:01,161
Come on.

1107
01:15:13,150 --> 01:15:14,481
It's been tampered with.

1108
01:15:14,630 --> 01:15:16,431
I don't think you should be
messing with that.

1109
01:15:17,270 --> 01:15:19,637
Why are my settings different?

1110
01:15:20,190 --> 01:15:21,555
Mike, we should leave.

1111
01:15:23,110 --> 01:15:24,839
- Did you do this?
- Mike.

1112
01:15:24,910 --> 01:15:26,196
Did you do this?

1113
01:15:26,550 --> 01:15:27,881
L.-

1114
01:15:31,230 --> 01:15:32,277
Yes, I did. But you don't understand.

1115
01:15:32,350 --> 01:15:34,239
Why? Why did you do this?

1116
01:15:34,670 --> 01:15:36,718
You know, just in case.

1117
01:15:36,990 --> 01:15:38,196
In case of what?

1118
01:15:40,990 --> 01:15:42,321
You don't think I'm scary.

1119
01:15:42,910 --> 01:15:45,072
- Mike...
- You said you believed in me.

1120
01:15:46,110 --> 01:15:48,710
But you're just like Hardscrabble.
You're just like everyone else!

1121
01:15:48,910 --> 01:15:49,957
Look, you'll get better and better...

1122
01:15:50,190 --> 01:15:52,557
I'm as scary as you!
I'm as scary as anyone!

1123
01:15:52,870 --> 01:15:54,440
- I just wanted to help.
- No.

1124
01:15:54,510 --> 01:15:56,035
You just wanted to help yourself.

1125
01:15:56,230 --> 01:15:57,311
Well, what was I supposed to do?

1126
01:15:57,390 --> 01:15:59,711
Let the whole team fail
because you don't have it?

1127
01:16:32,590 --> 01:16:34,672
So your calculations were a little off.

1128
01:16:34,750 --> 01:16:36,434
That door took me all semester.

1129
01:16:36,510 --> 01:16:39,400
It's too dangerous.
The professor's just going to shred it.

1130
01:16:47,270 --> 01:16:49,159
There he is, the big guy.

1131
01:16:49,230 --> 01:16:51,631
The first of many trophies, I am sure.

1132
01:16:53,390 --> 01:16:54,471
Sullivan.

1133
01:16:54,870 --> 01:16:56,520
Nice work out there.

1134
01:16:56,590 --> 01:16:58,319
I look forward to having you
back in class.

1135
01:16:59,990 --> 01:17:01,480
Hey, there he is!

1136
01:17:02,630 --> 01:17:04,997
Looks like I was wrong about you.

1137
01:17:05,070 --> 01:17:06,356
You're one of us after all.

1138
01:17:06,630 --> 01:17:09,474
Way to go, Sulley!
Welcome back, broham!

1139
01:17:10,670 --> 01:17:12,513
You are one of us now, okay?

1140
01:17:12,830 --> 01:17:15,993
Anytime you want to come hang out
and do whatever, you got a crew.

1141
01:17:17,390 --> 01:17:19,119
You're a ROR, buddy!

1142
01:17:19,190 --> 01:17:20,191
Hey!

1143
01:17:20,870 --> 01:17:22,076
Where are you going?

1144
01:17:36,190 --> 01:17:37,396
You did what?

1145
01:17:37,870 --> 01:17:39,440
My team had nothing to do with it.

1146
01:17:39,510 --> 01:17:42,320
It was all me. I cheated.

1147
01:17:43,390 --> 01:17:45,472
I expect you off campus by tomorrow.

1148
01:17:46,950 --> 01:17:48,076
Yes, ma'am.

1149
01:17:48,990 --> 01:17:51,311
You're a disgrace to this university

1150
01:17:52,470 --> 01:17:54,632
and your family name.

1151
01:17:59,870 --> 01:18:00,951
What's going on?

1152
01:18:01,030 --> 01:18:02,441
Someone broke into the door lab!

1153
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:03,751
What?

1154
01:18:06,950 --> 01:18:07,951
Oh, no.

1155
01:18:14,070 --> 01:18:16,152
Open the door! Don't go in there!

1156
01:18:55,630 --> 01:18:56,677
You look funny.

1157
01:18:59,230 --> 01:19:00,231
What?

1158
01:19:05,230 --> 01:19:07,232
I'm so tired. What's going on?

1159
01:19:07,470 --> 01:19:08,630
It's the middle of the night.

1160
01:19:09,270 --> 01:19:10,760
A little funny green guy.

1161
01:19:23,110 --> 01:19:25,795
I want to touch it! It's so cute!

1162
01:19:29,350 --> 01:19:30,476
James!

1163
01:19:32,750 --> 01:19:35,674
No one goes near that door
until the authorities arrive.

1164
01:19:35,950 --> 01:19:37,031
You don't think that could be...

1165
01:19:37,110 --> 01:19:39,158
- it's Mike.
- But he could die out there!

1166
01:19:41,710 --> 01:19:42,916
James, wait! We can help.

1167
01:19:44,310 --> 01:19:47,473
Leave it to the old master of sales.

1168
01:19:48,310 --> 01:19:50,597
We got a call in,
but that's the best we can do.

1169
01:19:50,790 --> 01:19:54,192
Don Carlton, sales.
Folks, today is your lucky day.

1170
01:19:54,270 --> 01:19:56,876
How many times have you asked
yourself the following question...

1171
01:19:57,190 --> 01:19:58,680
- Arrest him.
- Pardon?

1172
01:19:59,910 --> 01:20:00,911
Spread them, pops!

1173
01:20:01,110 --> 01:20:02,600
- Do you mind?
- Don't move!

1174
01:20:02,710 --> 01:20:03,711
What? Sullivan!

1175
01:20:04,110 --> 01:20:05,157
Don't you dare!

1176
01:20:05,910 --> 01:20:07,150
Sullivan! Don't go in there!

1177
01:20:14,910 --> 01:20:15,957
Mike?

1178
01:20:16,950 --> 01:20:18,714
Mike!

1179
01:20:18,790 --> 01:20:20,872
The kids said
they saw something in the cabin.

1180
01:20:20,950 --> 01:20:23,191
- They're calling it an alien.
- It was!

1181
01:20:23,510 --> 01:20:24,636
I saw a little green guy!

1182
01:20:24,830 --> 01:20:26,116
What's the problem, ma'am?

1183
01:20:33,710 --> 01:20:34,791
Mike?

1184
01:20:38,390 --> 01:20:39,880
Bear! A bear in the camp!

1185
01:20:49,270 --> 01:20:51,557
Down this way. All right?

1186
01:20:56,550 --> 01:20:58,234
I heard something over here!

1187
01:21:01,430 --> 01:21:02,875
Mike!

1188
01:21:04,790 --> 01:21:06,474
Come on, buddy.
Let's get you out of here.

1189
01:21:12,590 --> 01:21:15,514
This is all my fault. I'm sorry.

1190
01:21:17,630 --> 01:21:20,713
You were right.
They weren't scared of me.

1191
01:21:23,630 --> 01:21:25,553
I did everything right.

1192
01:21:25,710 --> 01:21:27,712
I wanted it more than anyone.

1193
01:21:29,310 --> 01:21:32,473
And I thought...
I thought if I wanted it enough,

1194
01:21:32,590 --> 01:21:34,319
I could show everybody that...

1195
01:21:35,510 --> 01:21:37,990
That Mike Wazowski
is something special.

1196
01:21:40,510 --> 01:21:41,921
And I'm just

1197
01:21:43,750 --> 01:21:44,797
not.

1198
01:21:51,230 --> 01:21:53,232
Look, Mike, I know how you feel.

1199
01:21:53,470 --> 01:21:55,313
Don't do that! Please, don't do that!

1200
01:21:55,390 --> 01:21:57,961
- You do not know how I feel.
- Mike, calm down.

1201
01:21:58,150 --> 01:22:00,550
Monsters like you have everything.
You don't have to be good.

1202
01:22:00,590 --> 01:22:02,877
You can mess up over and over again

1203
01:22:02,950 --> 01:22:04,475
- and the whole world loves you.
- Mike...

1204
01:22:04,550 --> 01:22:08,111
You'll never know what it's like to fail
because you were born a Sullivan!

1205
01:22:08,310 --> 01:22:11,280
Yeah, I'm a Sullivan.
I'm the Sullivan who flunked every test.

1206
01:22:11,350 --> 01:22:12,990
The one who got kicked out
of the program,

1207
01:22:13,030 --> 01:22:15,192
the one who was so afraid
to let everyone down

1208
01:22:15,270 --> 01:22:16,556
that I cheated.

1209
01:22:16,830 --> 01:22:18,036
And I lied.

1210
01:22:21,710 --> 01:22:23,872
Mike, I'll never know how you feel,

1211
01:22:25,510 --> 01:22:27,512
but you're not the only failure here.

1212
01:22:31,710 --> 01:22:36,272
I act scary, Mike, but most of the time

1213
01:22:37,750 --> 01:22:39,195
I'm terrified.

1214
01:22:51,550 --> 01:22:53,439
How come you never
told me that before?

1215
01:22:55,390 --> 01:22:56,516
Because

1216
01:22:57,830 --> 01:22:59,832
we weren't friends before.

1217
01:23:04,950 --> 01:23:05,997
Check the lake!

1218
01:23:06,350 --> 01:23:08,512
I heard something here!

1219
01:23:08,990 --> 01:23:10,515
This way!

1220
01:23:16,430 --> 01:23:17,841
I saw movement!

1221
01:23:18,310 --> 01:23:19,436
Over there!

1222
01:23:35,030 --> 01:23:36,111
Sulley!

1223
01:23:42,990 --> 01:23:44,071
He's cornered!

1224
01:23:52,230 --> 01:23:53,470
No!

1225
01:23:55,350 --> 01:23:56,351
They're still in there!

1226
01:23:56,550 --> 01:23:59,360
Until the authorities arrive,
this door stays off!

1227
01:23:59,630 --> 01:24:02,076
No! You can't do that! No!

1228
01:24:02,390 --> 01:24:05,758
Enough! I want this room cleared now!

1229
01:24:06,110 --> 01:24:07,475
You can't do this!

1230
01:24:19,150 --> 01:24:20,515
We got to get out of here!

1231
01:24:22,350 --> 01:24:24,114
- Let them come.
- What?

1232
01:24:24,350 --> 01:24:26,193
If we scare them,
I mean really scare them,

1233
01:24:26,270 --> 01:24:29,160
we could generate enough scream
to power the door from this side!

1234
01:24:29,470 --> 01:24:30,471
What are you talking about?

1235
01:24:30,550 --> 01:24:32,234
I have read every book
about Scaring ever written.

1236
01:24:32,310 --> 01:24:33,311
This could work!

1237
01:24:33,470 --> 01:24:34,960
They're adults. I can't do this.

1238
01:24:35,230 --> 01:24:36,641
Yes, you can. Just follow my lead.

1239
01:25:08,790 --> 01:25:09,837
<i>Mama!</i>

1240
01:25:10,350 --> 01:25:11,511
<i>Mama!</i>

1241
01:25:11,950 --> 01:25:14,032
<i>Mama...</i>

1242
01:25:28,470 --> 01:25:29,517
What the...

1243
01:25:32,910 --> 01:25:34,480
- Now what?
- Phase two.

1244
01:25:37,990 --> 01:25:39,435
Keep together.

1245
01:25:49,150 --> 01:25:50,436
Are you ready?

1246
01:25:50,550 --> 01:25:52,359
- Mike, I can't.
- Yes, you can.

1247
01:25:52,430 --> 01:25:54,432
Stop being a Sullivan
and start being you.

1248
01:25:55,270 --> 01:25:56,317
Call for backup.

1249
01:25:56,470 --> 01:25:57,710
Assistance on the north side.

1250
01:25:57,990 --> 01:26:00,277
Repeat, we need assistance
on the north side.

1251
01:26:00,430 --> 01:26:02,114
<i>Ranger,
answer me, what's your 20?</i>

1252
01:26:02,190 --> 01:26:04,716
We need assistance on the north side.
We have a...

1253
01:26:04,870 --> 01:26:06,110
Look! What was it?

1254
01:26:06,190 --> 01:26:07,430
Let's go.

1255
01:26:43,750 --> 01:26:44,751
Sulley, come on!

1256
01:27:11,070 --> 01:27:12,231
How?

1257
01:27:13,670 --> 01:27:15,115
How did you do this?

1258
01:27:16,310 --> 01:27:17,516
Don't ask me.

1259
01:27:25,590 --> 01:27:27,513
Move, move, move!
This is a 54-23 in progress.

1260
01:27:27,590 --> 01:27:28,870
All right, everybody, clear out.

1261
01:27:29,110 --> 01:27:30,555
Secure the perimeter.

1262
01:27:30,630 --> 01:27:32,758
No child breach.
Repeat: no child breach.

1263
01:27:33,270 --> 01:27:34,510
You ruined our doors!

1264
01:27:34,590 --> 01:27:36,877
I've been working on my door
all semester!

1265
01:27:36,950 --> 01:27:37,951
Let's go, you two.

1266
01:27:38,230 --> 01:27:40,392
- You're alive!
- We are so glad you're safe.

1267
01:27:44,230 --> 01:27:45,197
Hey, wait!

1268
01:27:45,270 --> 01:27:46,271
What's going to happen to them?

1269
01:27:46,350 --> 01:27:49,433
That's for the university president
to decide.

1270
01:27:50,190 --> 01:27:54,115
But you can be sure
we'll be watching these two.

1271
01:27:54,190 --> 01:27:56,113
Always watching.

1272
01:28:01,310 --> 01:28:03,597
- Expelled?
- Yeah, we really messed up.

1273
01:28:04,550 --> 01:28:06,279
So, you're leaving?

1274
01:28:06,630 --> 01:28:08,837
Yeah, buddy. We have to go.

1275
01:28:09,790 --> 01:28:11,235
Harsh, man.

1276
01:28:11,470 --> 01:28:13,950
I'm sorry, guys.
You'd be in the Scaring program

1277
01:28:14,030 --> 01:28:15,230
right now if it wasn't for us.

1278
01:28:18,310 --> 01:28:19,311
What?

1279
01:28:19,630 --> 01:28:21,837
Well, it is
the gosh-darnedest thing.

1280
01:28:21,910 --> 01:28:23,912
Hardscrabble's letting us
into the Scare program.

1281
01:28:23,990 --> 01:28:25,071
What?

1282
01:28:25,150 --> 01:28:27,312
She was impressed with
our performance in the games.

1283
01:28:27,390 --> 01:28:29,392
She invited us to join next semester!

1284
01:28:29,630 --> 01:28:31,997
Congratulations, guys!

1285
01:28:32,270 --> 01:28:34,432
And that's not the only piece
of good news.

1286
01:28:34,510 --> 01:28:36,194
Sherrie and I are engaged!

1287
01:28:36,630 --> 01:28:38,758
Who is Sherrie?

1288
01:28:39,350 --> 01:28:40,875
She's my mom.

1289
01:28:40,950 --> 01:28:43,874
Well, if it isn't my two favorite fellas!

1290
01:28:43,950 --> 01:28:45,520
Come here. Give me some sugar.

1291
01:28:47,270 --> 01:28:48,920
So uncomfortable.

1292
01:28:48,990 --> 01:28:50,435
Come on, Scott.

1293
01:28:50,510 --> 01:28:52,592
I don't want you to think of me
as your new dad.

1294
01:28:52,670 --> 01:28:54,752
After all, we're fraternity brothers first.

1295
01:28:54,830 --> 01:28:55,911
This is so weird.

1296
01:28:56,230 --> 01:28:57,755
Just think of me
as your big brother

1297
01:28:58,030 --> 01:28:59,361
that's marrying your mother.

1298
01:28:59,430 --> 01:29:00,511
Wait. Hold on.

1299
01:29:00,590 --> 01:29:03,799
We're brothers who share
the same mom slash wife.

1300
01:29:03,870 --> 01:29:04,871
That's worse.

1301
01:29:06,870 --> 01:29:08,520
Well, I guess we should be going now.

1302
01:29:10,310 --> 01:29:12,551
Promise me you'll keep in touch.

1303
01:29:17,790 --> 01:29:20,361
You're the scariest bunch
of monsters I have ever met.

1304
01:29:23,950 --> 01:29:26,237
Don't let anyone tell you different.

1305
01:29:52,310 --> 01:29:55,280
So, what now?

1306
01:29:56,750 --> 01:29:59,431
You know, for the first time in my life,
I don't really have a plan.

1307
01:30:00,070 --> 01:30:03,438
You're the great Mike Wazowski.
You'll come up with something.

1308
01:30:04,750 --> 01:30:07,594
I think it's time I leave the greatness
to other monsters.

1309
01:30:08,590 --> 01:30:10,638
I'm okay just being okay.

1310
01:30:19,750 --> 01:30:20,956
So long, Sull.

1311
01:30:22,390 --> 01:30:23,437
So long.

1312
01:30:50,630 --> 01:30:51,756
Wazowski!

1313
01:30:51,870 --> 01:30:53,281
Stop the bus!

1314
01:30:55,470 --> 01:30:56,596
Are you crazy?

1315
01:30:57,230 --> 01:30:58,720
Mike,

1316
01:30:58,950 --> 01:31:01,157
I don't know a single Scarer
who can do what you do.

1317
01:31:01,590 --> 01:31:03,479
I know, everyone sees us together,

1318
01:31:03,630 --> 01:31:06,076
they think I'm the one running the show,
but the truth is,

1319
01:31:06,150 --> 01:31:08,994
I've been riding your coattails
since day one!

1320
01:31:09,430 --> 01:31:11,080
You made the deal with Hardscrabble.

1321
01:31:11,310 --> 01:31:13,790
You took a hopeless team
and made them champions.

1322
01:31:13,870 --> 01:31:15,315
All I did was catch a pig!

1323
01:31:15,750 --> 01:31:16,990
Technically, I caught the pig.

1324
01:31:17,390 --> 01:31:20,280
Exactly! And you think you're just okay?

1325
01:31:20,350 --> 01:31:22,830
You pulled off the biggest Scare
this school has ever seen!

1326
01:31:23,110 --> 01:31:24,999
- That wasn't me!
- That was you!

1327
01:31:25,110 --> 01:31:27,192
You think I could have done that
without you?

1328
01:31:27,310 --> 01:31:29,677
I didn't even bring a pencil
on the first day of school.

1329
01:31:31,990 --> 01:31:34,675
Mike, you're not scary. Not even a little.

1330
01:31:34,750 --> 01:31:36,195
But you are fearless.

1331
01:31:38,350 --> 01:31:40,876
And if Hardscrabble can't see that,
then she can just...

1332
01:31:40,990 --> 01:31:43,072
I can just what?

1333
01:31:44,870 --> 01:31:48,192
Careful, Mr. Sullivan.
I was just warming up to you.

1334
01:31:49,110 --> 01:31:50,111
Sorry.

1335
01:31:50,510 --> 01:31:52,035
Well, gentlemen,

1336
01:31:53,390 --> 01:31:56,360
it seems you made the front page again.

1337
01:31:58,990 --> 01:32:00,470
The two of you did something together

1338
01:32:00,870 --> 01:32:02,872
that no one has ever done before.

1339
01:32:04,070 --> 01:32:05,435
You surprised me.

1340
01:32:06,910 --> 01:32:10,517
Perhaps I should keep an eye out
for more surprises

1341
01:32:10,590 --> 01:32:12,080
like you in my program.

1342
01:32:13,030 --> 01:32:16,000
But as far as the two of you
are concerned

1343
01:32:16,110 --> 01:32:18,112
there is nothing I can do for you now.

1344
01:32:19,390 --> 01:32:22,200
Except, perhaps, wish you luck.

1345
01:32:26,230 --> 01:32:30,076
And, Mr. Wazowski,
keep surprising people.

1346
01:32:40,390 --> 01:32:43,951
You know, there is still one way
we can work at a Scare company.

1347
01:32:47,630 --> 01:32:49,678
They're always hiring in the mailroom.

1348
01:32:54,030 --> 01:32:55,839
This is better than I ever imagined!

1349
01:32:55,910 --> 01:32:58,641
I bet we break the all-time record
in our first year.

1350
01:32:58,710 --> 01:33:00,155
Mike, we're mail guys.

1351
01:33:00,230 --> 01:33:03,439
I know. I'm talking about
the record for letters delivered!

1352
01:33:04,990 --> 01:33:07,357
All right, newbies, quit goofing around.

1353
01:33:07,430 --> 01:33:10,036
I'll have you know tampering
with the mail is a crime

1354
01:33:10,110 --> 01:33:12,033
- punishable by banishment!
- Yes, sir.

1355
01:33:12,110 --> 01:33:13,714
We're right on it, Mr. Snowman.

1356
01:33:13,790 --> 01:33:15,280
The team of Wazowski and Sullivan

1357
01:33:15,350 --> 01:33:17,432
are going to change the world
starting today!

1358
01:33:17,510 --> 01:33:18,511
Say scream!

1359
01:33:18,630 --> 01:33:19,677
- Scream!
- Scream!

1360
01:34:04,070 --> 01:34:05,590
Wazowski, good luck on your first day!

1361
01:34:05,630 --> 01:34:06,711
<i>Thanks, Mew.</i>

1362
01:34:06,790 --> 01:34:08,792
- Good luck, Mike!
- Thanks, fellas.

1363
01:34:15,510 --> 01:34:16,841
You coming, Coach?

1364
01:34:18,270 --> 01:34:19,681
You better believe it.

1365
01:43:00,310 --> 01:43:03,075
I made it! My first day of class!

1366
01:43:04,470 --> 01:43:08,077
The school year's over, son.
You missed it.

1367
01:43:10,070 --> 01:43:11,117
Great.

1367
01:43:12,305 --> 01:44:12,332
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
