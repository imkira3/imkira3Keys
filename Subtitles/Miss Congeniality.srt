2
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:58,849
They're fighting again!

3
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:06,148
Oh, boy.

4
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:09,985
Don't! Wait! Not my homework!

5
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:11,570
No! Stop it! No!

6
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:13,280
Problem, gentlemen?

7
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:14,865
Hey, dork-brain!

8
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:21,016
If you weren't a girl,
I'd beat your face off.

9
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:22,581
You're calling me a girl?

10
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,124
You called me one!

11
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:25,918
You asked for it.

12
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:28,687
Ow!

13
00:01:31,384 --> 00:01:33,010
Now get out of here!

14
00:01:38,517 --> 00:01:40,017
Forget those guys.

15
00:01:40,185 --> 00:01:43,521
They're jealous because you're
smart and funny.

16
00:01:43,688 --> 00:01:45,689
And girls like that.

17
00:01:45,941 --> 00:01:47,608
What girls?

18
00:01:48,026 --> 00:01:49,652
Lots of girls.

19
00:01:50,112 --> 00:01:52,863
I mean... I like you.

20
00:01:53,031 --> 00:01:56,951
I don't like you. Now everybody
thinks I need a girl to fight for me.

21
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,328
You are a dork-brain.

22
00:02:03,667 --> 00:02:05,000
My nose!

23
00:02:08,421 --> 00:02:09,521
Wimp!

24
00:02:29,901 --> 00:02:31,735
Moe and Larry in the house.

25
00:02:34,573 --> 00:02:36,325
Grant, what have we got out back?

26
00:02:37,077 --> 00:02:38,452
All clear here, sir.

27
00:02:38,912 --> 00:02:40,329
Matthews, what do you got?

28
00:02:41,498 --> 00:02:43,583
Returnable cans, sir.

29
00:02:43,917 --> 00:02:45,751
I think I'm up to 75 cents.

30
00:02:47,337 --> 00:02:48,713
CLONSKY:
Hey, we got a cab.

31
00:02:50,757 --> 00:02:52,216
Here comes Curly.

32
00:03:13,614 --> 00:03:15,072
Yep, the Three Stooges.

33
00:03:22,623 --> 00:03:24,874
Check it out, lvan's packing.

34
00:03:39,306 --> 00:03:41,809
Thank you! We've got a briefcase.

35
00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:44,145
Hart, waiting for visual confirmation.

36
00:03:44,313 --> 00:03:45,939
No disc yet.

37
00:03:50,778 --> 00:03:52,403
Case is opening.

38
00:03:54,573 --> 00:03:56,407
This woman's ass is in the way.

39
00:03:59,328 --> 00:04:03,248
Hart, we can't see a goddamn thing.
We need to see the discs.

40
00:04:05,167 --> 00:04:07,945
- This broad's got two asses!
- Hart, do something!

41
00:04:08,254 --> 00:04:09,587
Excuse me.

42
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:11,673
You wanting something else?

43
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,468
Yeah. You know what?
I really love this borscht.

44
00:04:16,303 --> 00:04:18,179
Or, as they say in Russian:

45
00:04:23,435 --> 00:04:26,271
- All right, Hart. We got the discs.
- We're moving in!

46
00:04:42,454 --> 00:04:44,205
FBI! Get down on the ground! Now!

47
00:04:44,373 --> 00:04:46,167
- Get down on the ground!
- Do it!

48
00:04:46,544 --> 00:04:48,878
Keep your hands where I can see them!

49
00:04:52,174 --> 00:04:53,274
No English.

50
00:05:05,646 --> 00:05:10,233
Hart! Nobody moves until I see
some goddamn "Lazhitsa na pol"!

51
00:05:15,614 --> 00:05:17,240
Sir, he's turning purple!

52
00:05:17,616 --> 00:05:20,076
Hart, until we secure, you stay.

53
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,001
- Sir.
- Hart!

54
00:05:29,086 --> 00:05:32,589
Sir, that is one really, really
purple Russian, sir!

55
00:05:32,757 --> 00:05:35,258
MCDONALD:
He's still armed! Nobody moves!

56
00:05:35,426 --> 00:05:37,510
Hands up! Back off! Back off!

57
00:05:40,681 --> 00:05:42,640
- No, sir. He's not gonna die.
- Hart!

58
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,559
He's not good enough for that.

59
00:05:45,561 --> 00:05:49,939
His victims didn't get a chance
to choke on a peanut, did they, sir?

60
00:05:51,736 --> 00:05:53,111
Now you're going down.

61
00:05:55,948 --> 00:05:58,742
Drop the guns or I'll kill her.

62
00:05:59,702 --> 00:06:00,856
KRASHOW:
Lvan, out the back.

63
00:06:00,953 --> 00:06:04,081
You're not killing anyone,
you peanut-eating bastard.

64
00:06:06,626 --> 00:06:08,418
Step back!

65
00:06:11,756 --> 00:06:14,132
Move it! Move it!

66
00:06:33,277 --> 00:06:34,377
Party's over, boys.

67
00:06:40,326 --> 00:06:42,494
How's your head, my little piroshki?

68
00:06:43,329 --> 00:06:46,998
This is gonna put you away
for a long time. You know that?

69
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:49,334
Let's get that ambulance in here!

70
00:06:51,087 --> 00:06:53,672
- Shut up!
- Stay with me, all right?

71
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,967
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry. You did a great job!

72
00:07:12,026 --> 00:07:14,820
Nice work. See you back there, okay?

73
00:07:19,617 --> 00:07:22,453
Come on, Hart. The van's waiting.

74
00:07:22,829 --> 00:07:25,831
I got Grant shot.
I shouldn't have moved.

75
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,958
Come on, you made a choice.

76
00:07:28,168 --> 00:07:30,961
It was wrong, but that's it.
It's over.

77
00:07:31,254 --> 00:07:34,047
By the way, you look like hell.

78
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:39,781
- Morning, Mrs. Schwartz. Schnatzie.
- Good morning, Gracie.

79
00:09:41,179 --> 00:09:42,430
Hart.

80
00:09:42,764 --> 00:09:43,889
Yes, sir.

81
00:09:44,099 --> 00:09:46,392
ETA, 20 minutes.

82
00:09:46,685 --> 00:09:49,145
No problem. Breakdown?

83
00:09:50,355 --> 00:09:53,899
Yes, sir. Negative.
Do not need assistance.

84
00:09:54,443 --> 00:09:56,777
Ten-four, sir. Yes, I know it's hot.

85
00:10:21,555 --> 00:10:23,473
Hey, you cannot park...

86
00:10:27,728 --> 00:10:29,937
It's an emergency. Official business.

87
00:10:30,147 --> 00:10:32,565
Ma'am, aside, please. Thank you.

88
00:10:32,816 --> 00:10:35,318
Official business, sir.
Emergency. Step aside.

89
00:10:35,527 --> 00:10:37,570
Hey, get lost! I'm waiting here.

90
00:10:37,821 --> 00:10:39,906
FBI. You might want
to stay out of this.

91
00:10:40,074 --> 00:10:43,242
Excuse me.
Sir, ma'am, please back off.

92
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:47,580
All right. I need eight double-tall...

93
00:10:50,584 --> 00:10:53,002
Eight double-tall lattes.
One with no foam.

94
00:10:53,212 --> 00:10:55,880
Five decaf lattes with a long straw.

95
00:10:56,090 --> 00:11:00,093
Four caramel macchiattos. Double up
on the cup. I got a long way to go.

96
00:11:00,344 --> 00:11:03,471
Two blueberry scones
with the little granules on top...

97
00:11:03,681 --> 00:11:05,556
...and one Starbucks compilation CD.

98
00:11:06,934 --> 00:11:09,060
- No! I would like...
- Oh, jeez.

99
00:11:16,777 --> 00:11:19,237
What's going on? Where's McDonald?

100
00:11:19,448 --> 00:11:21,908
Could we put out an APB
on my Frappuccino?

101
00:11:22,118 --> 00:11:25,453
It's in the bag. Did he say anything
about last night?

102
00:11:25,621 --> 00:11:29,207
Relax. Don't annoy him.
Don't say anything. Don't argue.

103
00:11:29,417 --> 00:11:32,127
I don't argue. I never argue.
When do I argue?

104
00:11:32,378 --> 00:11:35,296
I might have a heated discussion
with somebody.

105
00:11:35,548 --> 00:11:38,466
Is this you not arguing?
Because you suck at it.

106
00:11:38,634 --> 00:11:40,135
MCDONALD:
Morning, everybody.

107
00:11:40,594 --> 00:11:42,512
Morning, sir. It's...

108
00:11:43,431 --> 00:11:44,531
Sir.

109
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,224
Okay, everybody.

110
00:11:46,642 --> 00:11:50,228
I know you're all concerned
about Grant's condition.

111
00:11:50,438 --> 00:11:52,605
So I'm happy to report...

112
00:11:53,149 --> 00:11:56,735
...Jerry's gonna be fine. He'll be
out of the hospital in two weeks.

113
00:11:56,944 --> 00:11:58,526
He says he's expecting lots of gifts.

114
00:12:00,072 --> 00:12:01,823
Okay, everybody.

115
00:12:02,366 --> 00:12:06,161
So much for the good news. We got
another letter from the Citizen.

116
00:12:06,829 --> 00:12:08,872
Arson, explosives, poison...

117
00:12:09,081 --> 00:12:11,791
...this guy never works
the same way twice.

118
00:12:13,377 --> 00:12:15,503
The only thing we know for sure...

119
00:12:16,005 --> 00:12:19,007
...is, we get these letters full
of incomprehensible riddles...

120
00:12:19,258 --> 00:12:21,676
...he strikes and suddenly
the clues make sense.

121
00:12:22,678 --> 00:12:24,596
This one is down in Intelligence.

122
00:12:24,805 --> 00:12:27,851
Hopefully, we'll get a lead
before somebody gets killed.

123
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:29,186
In the meantime...

124
00:12:29,479 --> 00:12:32,314
...Matthews, get a team together.

125
00:12:32,648 --> 00:12:35,400
Sir, you want me to take point?

126
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:37,694
For five years you've wanted it.

127
00:12:37,945 --> 00:12:41,281
Last night, you earned it.
Pick your team.

128
00:12:41,491 --> 00:12:44,159
I want preliminaries by 3.
That's it.

129
00:12:45,328 --> 00:12:46,428
Sir...?

130
00:12:49,957 --> 00:12:51,374
Who's buying me lunch?

131
00:12:51,542 --> 00:12:54,878
Sir, I would like to talk
about what happened last night.

132
00:12:55,046 --> 00:12:56,713
I didn't exactly follow orders...

133
00:12:56,964 --> 00:12:59,382
"Exactly" follow orders?
There's no such thing.

134
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:01,551
You follow orders or you don't.

135
00:13:01,719 --> 00:13:03,720
No arguments, sir. None whatsoever.

136
00:13:03,971 --> 00:13:05,931
Until the hearing,
you're out of the field.

137
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,350
The hearing is totally warranted.

138
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:11,186
Wouldn't I be better
on the Citizen case?

139
00:13:11,395 --> 00:13:13,730
I have a background
in profiling and decoding.

140
00:13:13,981 --> 00:13:15,232
- No.
- I could contribute.

141
00:13:15,483 --> 00:13:17,067
Like you contributed last night?

142
00:13:17,235 --> 00:13:19,319
By putting yourself
and five agents in jeopardy?

143
00:13:19,529 --> 00:13:21,696
I'll save the rest
for the review board.

144
00:13:21,906 --> 00:13:25,075
You will bury yourself
under a mountain of paperwork.

145
00:13:25,326 --> 00:13:27,244
Discussion is over.

146
00:13:45,181 --> 00:13:47,432
Mike, give me a pint.

147
00:13:47,851 --> 00:13:49,017
Rough day?

148
00:13:49,352 --> 00:13:50,853
The worst.

149
00:13:51,062 --> 00:13:52,396
Sure you want a whole one?

150
00:13:53,022 --> 00:13:55,732
Yeah. Hit me bigtime, baby.

151
00:13:55,984 --> 00:14:00,571
Hey, Einstein. If you figure out
that Citizen letter, let me know.

152
00:14:02,615 --> 00:14:05,576
Congratulations on the op.
It's a big shot.

153
00:14:06,202 --> 00:14:07,369
Thanks.

154
00:14:07,787 --> 00:14:09,621
How are you doing? You okay?

155
00:14:09,873 --> 00:14:11,290
I'm good.

156
00:14:13,459 --> 00:14:14,877
You're starting early today.

157
00:14:15,086 --> 00:14:17,921
Yeah, I'm gonna get chip-faced.
Want to join me?

158
00:14:18,214 --> 00:14:21,258
I'd love to, but I have
a pressing social engagement.

159
00:14:21,926 --> 00:14:23,026
Beth!

160
00:14:23,553 --> 00:14:24,887
Brownie meeting.

161
00:14:25,096 --> 00:14:27,598
- Mike, give me a beer and...
- Um...

162
00:14:27,932 --> 00:14:29,433
Milk. Give her milk.

163
00:14:29,809 --> 00:14:31,560
White wine spritzer.

164
00:14:31,811 --> 00:14:34,229
Are most of the people in here agents?

165
00:14:34,439 --> 00:14:37,526
As a matter of fact, here's
an agent. Gracie Hart.

166
00:14:37,777 --> 00:14:39,278
Beth Carter.

167
00:14:41,072 --> 00:14:42,323
Right back to you.

168
00:14:42,574 --> 00:14:46,160
Beth is an undergrad at Vassar,
doing a paper on law enforcement.

169
00:14:46,411 --> 00:14:48,245
I'm helping her get an inside look.

170
00:14:48,496 --> 00:14:50,623
I bet she'll do the same for you.

171
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:54,126
Gracie, I would love to get
a woman's point of view.

172
00:14:54,336 --> 00:14:57,671
You're barking up the wrong tree.
Right, Hart?

173
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:02,468
Do all the women have to wear
those really masculine shoes?

174
00:15:05,847 --> 00:15:09,433
I get these made special by the guy
that put the tattoo on my ass.

175
00:15:09,643 --> 00:15:12,436
We'll leave you with Ben and Jerry.
Catch you later.

176
00:15:12,646 --> 00:15:15,314
- Nice meeting you.
- You too.

177
00:15:17,609 --> 00:15:19,652
Hope you have a good time at the mall.

178
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,570
Wohop is the place.

179
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:25,115
Wohop is good, but if you like
variety, you go to La Chinita Linda.

180
00:15:25,325 --> 00:15:26,784
Their rice and beans are slamming.

181
00:15:26,993 --> 00:15:29,703
I don't want variety.
I get pork fried rice every...

182
00:15:29,871 --> 00:15:33,123
I figured it out! I tried to create
a content-based pattern...

183
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:34,829
...similar to his previous letters.

184
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:36,669
But this time, he used a signifier.

185
00:15:36,878 --> 00:15:39,213
In this case, the word "miss"...

186
00:15:39,381 --> 00:15:43,010
...in the subsequent letters.
Will you let me finish?

187
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,221
It's the Miss United States Pageant.

188
00:15:45,472 --> 00:15:48,224
Yeah. Intelligence thought so too.

189
00:15:48,517 --> 00:15:49,892
What do we got?

190
00:15:50,394 --> 00:15:53,562
Miss United States from San Antonio,
Texas, home of the Alamo.

191
00:15:53,814 --> 00:15:55,106
I forgot the Alamo.

192
00:15:55,315 --> 00:15:58,484
The pageant lasts three days.
Preliminaries, conferences...

193
00:15:58,694 --> 00:16:01,570
...the live telecast.
It's a logistical nightmare.

194
00:16:01,738 --> 00:16:03,072
Not just a babe-fest.

195
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:06,659
Jesus, we've only got 48 hours.

196
00:16:06,994 --> 00:16:08,995
Okay, gentlemen.

197
00:16:09,746 --> 00:16:11,247
Where do we start?

198
00:16:14,543 --> 00:16:16,669
I got a cousin in Texas.

199
00:16:17,087 --> 00:16:21,007
You might want to call the network and
pageant people. Set up a meeting.

200
00:16:23,218 --> 00:16:26,345
Because you'll probably need
their cooperation.

201
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:28,097
Yeah.

202
00:16:28,265 --> 00:16:30,433
Yeah, I can do that. Let's do that.

203
00:16:30,684 --> 00:16:32,268
What about jurisdiction?

204
00:16:32,644 --> 00:16:35,021
The Citizen has been ours
from the start.

205
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:37,606
You might want to call San Antonio.

206
00:16:37,774 --> 00:16:40,067
Grease some wheels so they like us...

207
00:16:40,277 --> 00:16:41,861
...when we need manpower and tech.

208
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:43,446
While I'm at it, let's do that.

209
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:44,880
Good idea.

210
00:16:45,032 --> 00:16:47,744
He loves to make a splash.
His target will be public...

211
00:16:47,953 --> 00:16:50,747
...like one of these outdoor prelims
or a TV broadcast.

212
00:16:50,956 --> 00:16:52,790
Telecasters at the convention center.

213
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:56,753
We're gonna need surveillance
on the interior perimeter.

214
00:16:56,962 --> 00:16:59,547
We'll need more.
There's a million places...

215
00:16:59,757 --> 00:17:03,384
...only these bikini-stuffers can go:
Backstage areas, hotel rooms...

216
00:17:03,594 --> 00:17:05,470
We need to get somebody in there.

217
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,889
Yeah! Now I'm thinking...

218
00:17:08,724 --> 00:17:09,824
...undercover.

219
00:17:10,059 --> 00:17:11,476
Good idea, boss.

220
00:17:11,685 --> 00:17:13,061
I got just the girl.

221
00:17:15,647 --> 00:17:17,899
- Huh? Huh?
- All right.

222
00:17:18,192 --> 00:17:19,942
That's nothing. Check this out.

223
00:17:20,152 --> 00:17:23,488
Compliments of my daughter:
The "Dress Up Sally" web site.

224
00:17:33,332 --> 00:17:34,999
What did I tell you? Hot, right?

225
00:17:35,167 --> 00:17:36,267
Yeah, baby.

226
00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:38,753
You got a little problem.

227
00:17:38,962 --> 00:17:40,296
She's perfect!

228
00:17:40,506 --> 00:17:41,672
Look to the left.

229
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:45,176
Down... down...

230
00:17:46,178 --> 00:17:48,221
HART: There you go.
ERIC: "On maternity leave"?

231
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:49,680
That's not gonna work.

232
00:17:49,848 --> 00:17:52,602
Not unless it's
"The Miss Lamaze Pageant."

233
00:17:58,234 --> 00:18:00,318
Can you do a search?

234
00:18:00,528 --> 00:18:03,363
Female field agents under 35.

235
00:18:15,668 --> 00:18:16,793
Jensen, Jensen!

236
00:18:28,472 --> 00:18:31,850
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
I got it, I got it!

237
00:18:42,778 --> 00:18:43,878
Oh, no!

238
00:18:44,029 --> 00:18:45,321
That's right, that's right!

239
00:18:49,076 --> 00:18:51,411
You think that's good?
Check this out.

240
00:18:51,662 --> 00:18:53,079
I got the winner right here.

241
00:18:53,289 --> 00:18:54,389
Scorekeepers ready?

242
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:02,257
This is the best part.

243
00:19:08,055 --> 00:19:09,155
Oh!

244
00:19:15,062 --> 00:19:16,438
He's right behind me, isn't he?

245
00:19:16,606 --> 00:19:18,565
Not really my color, is it?

246
00:19:19,775 --> 00:19:20,942
Sir, we were just...

247
00:19:21,569 --> 00:19:24,279
...looking for someone
to go undercover at the pageant.

248
00:19:25,406 --> 00:19:27,199
And I'm the best we have.

249
00:19:27,408 --> 00:19:29,326
It doesn't inspire much confidence.

250
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:31,453
Get back to work.

251
00:19:31,954 --> 00:19:35,624
- Hart, shouldn't you be at a desk?
- Yes, sir.

252
00:19:37,043 --> 00:19:39,711
You don't say anything?
Made me look like an idiot.

253
00:19:39,921 --> 00:19:42,547
Do I have eyes in the back of my head?

254
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:45,320
- He was standing right behind me.
- What were we gonna say?

255
00:19:45,468 --> 00:19:46,593
- What?
- This one.

256
00:19:47,637 --> 00:19:49,005
ERIC:
Are you kidding? It's Hart.

257
00:19:49,138 --> 00:19:51,556
Cut it off. Let's go back to work.

258
00:19:55,811 --> 00:19:56,911
Very funny.

259
00:19:57,063 --> 00:19:58,605
Hold on. That's not bad.

260
00:19:58,856 --> 00:20:03,401
Hold on, nothing. Hit the save button
because you won't see that again.

261
00:20:09,285 --> 00:20:11,495
- What do you say?
- No freaking way.

262
00:20:11,663 --> 00:20:12,788
Why not?

263
00:20:12,997 --> 00:20:15,832
I won't parade around in a swimsuit
like some bimbo...

264
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,920
...named Gracie Lou Freebush,
and all she wants is world peace.

265
00:20:21,256 --> 00:20:22,589
It wouldn't be like that.

266
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,008
You'd be on the undercover team.

267
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,094
Right. In a thong.

268
00:20:29,097 --> 00:20:30,681
In a tasteful one-piece!

269
00:20:30,932 --> 00:20:33,433
You do a few butt-shaping exercises...

270
00:20:33,685 --> 00:20:35,018
...you could pull this off.

271
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,812
You know what? Pull this off.

272
00:20:37,021 --> 00:20:38,689
Is it because McDonald hates me?

273
00:20:38,898 --> 00:20:41,024
Or is it, like, a woman thing?

274
00:20:43,945 --> 00:20:46,905
Don't kid yourself.
Nobody thinks of you that way.

275
00:20:51,661 --> 00:20:53,287
He's punishing me, isn't he?

276
00:20:53,496 --> 00:20:55,872
I had to beg him to let you do this.

277
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,709
That's right. Like it or not,
you screwed up, pal.

278
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,294
Sit down, sit down.

279
00:21:07,552 --> 00:21:10,222
I've never been in a beauty pageant.

280
00:21:10,473 --> 00:21:13,559
I don't even own a dress.
I don't even own a brush.

281
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:15,352
Ow, Jesus. Oh.

282
00:21:16,813 --> 00:21:19,565
Which part of that
is supposed to shock me?

283
00:21:28,658 --> 00:21:30,242
Let's suspend reality for a second...

284
00:21:30,493 --> 00:21:31,910
...and pretend I said yes.

285
00:21:32,078 --> 00:21:34,204
I got to do everything? Like...

286
00:21:34,414 --> 00:21:37,041
...the whole big hair
and the makeup and...

287
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,350
Damn right.

288
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:42,713
The spinning, the twirling, the
smiling, the cute little tap number.

289
00:21:44,257 --> 00:21:45,424
Hundred bucks on Matthews.

290
00:21:46,051 --> 00:21:47,968
I don't know. She's got rage.

291
00:21:50,597 --> 00:21:52,014
I'll take that bet.

292
00:22:00,607 --> 00:22:03,359
- That's right. That's right.
- Yeah!

293
00:22:03,526 --> 00:22:05,277
Yeah, baby.

294
00:22:06,988 --> 00:22:08,280
So you're saying...

295
00:22:08,531 --> 00:22:10,866
...I have to wear the bathing suit?

296
00:22:11,117 --> 00:22:14,370
Yeah, you have
to wear the bathing suit.

297
00:22:15,123 --> 00:22:16,290
Okay.

298
00:22:18,877 --> 00:22:20,461
You go, girl.

299
00:22:23,131 --> 00:22:25,132
Where am I gonna put my gun?

300
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:27,885
No place I want to know about.

301
00:22:29,596 --> 00:22:33,432
What could possibly motivate anybody
to enter a beauty pageant?

302
00:22:33,642 --> 00:22:35,935
Scholarship money,
a chance to see the world...

303
00:22:36,144 --> 00:22:38,020
...broaden your horizons...

304
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:41,565
So join the Marines. It's like
feminism never even happened.

305
00:22:41,775 --> 00:22:45,820
Any woman that does this is catering
to misogynistic Neanderthal mentality.

306
00:22:46,029 --> 00:22:48,114
I dated Young Miss Scarsdale.

307
00:22:48,323 --> 00:22:50,282
Can you really be this superficial?

308
00:22:50,492 --> 00:22:52,159
Hard to believe, right?

309
00:22:52,327 --> 00:22:53,427
Here we are.

310
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:56,664
Therefore, we'd like to use
one of our team undercover.

311
00:22:56,832 --> 00:22:58,582
Am I hearing this correctly?

312
00:22:58,792 --> 00:23:03,170
Kathy, these people want
to put one of their agents...

313
00:23:03,588 --> 00:23:04,839
...in the pageant.

314
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:06,190
They want her to win?

315
00:23:06,425 --> 00:23:08,050
No, ma'am.

316
00:23:08,927 --> 00:23:11,137
We will need your help
with the judging...

317
00:23:11,346 --> 00:23:13,681
...so our agent is in the top five...

318
00:23:13,932 --> 00:23:16,851
...to have access to
all the areas at all times.

319
00:23:17,102 --> 00:23:19,353
- Absolutely not.
- Miss Morningside...

320
00:23:19,688 --> 00:23:21,911
...we understand how important
this beauty pageant...

321
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:23,359
Excuse me.

322
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:25,778
This is not a beauty pageant.

323
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:28,030
This is a scholarship program.

324
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:30,992
And it has been ever since my reign.

325
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:34,203
I fully intend on maintaining
that credo.

326
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:35,908
Absolutely, Miss Morningside.

327
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,666
We're here to protect the girls.
Women.

328
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:40,126
Scholarship ladies.

329
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:45,631
There's nothing more important to me
than the safety of my girls.

330
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:48,718
I'd rather cancel the pageant
than have them blown up.

331
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:50,845
Especially without their knowledge.

332
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:54,724
We went to the network to cancel,
but they refused.

333
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:56,142
We can't force them.

334
00:23:57,728 --> 00:23:58,853
I'm confused.

335
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:00,897
What state is she going to be from?

336
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,065
All the winners have been chosen.

337
00:24:03,734 --> 00:24:07,904
We recently discovered some
information about Miss New Jersey.

338
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:11,741
And her performance in a little
film called Arma Get It On.

339
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:13,910
Was that her?

340
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:15,536
Oh, yeah!

341
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:19,415
She was gonna drop out pretty soon,
if you know what I mean.

342
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:26,090
Do you have an agent in mind?

343
00:24:30,888 --> 00:24:31,988
Sorry.

344
00:24:33,766 --> 00:24:36,518
Let me get you
Victor Melling's number.

345
00:24:36,685 --> 00:24:37,785
Frank.

346
00:24:37,937 --> 00:24:39,521
He's our pageant consultant.

347
00:24:40,064 --> 00:24:41,231
Frank.

348
00:24:41,774 --> 00:24:43,566
Maybe he can do something to help.

349
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,876
Frank!

350
00:24:45,444 --> 00:24:47,362
Oh! Just one minute.

351
00:24:49,365 --> 00:24:51,199
This is my assistant, Frank Tobin.

352
00:24:51,575 --> 00:24:53,243
Hi, everyone.

353
00:24:53,452 --> 00:24:56,246
Would you get these people
Victor's number, please?

354
00:24:56,455 --> 00:24:57,789
And get me a spring water.

355
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,624
And tuck in your shirt.

356
00:25:01,377 --> 00:25:03,962
That, that was... a water for you...

357
00:25:04,171 --> 00:25:05,463
...and...

358
00:25:05,714 --> 00:25:08,174
Victor Melling's number.

359
00:25:17,977 --> 00:25:20,144
Thank you. Thank you.

360
00:25:23,232 --> 00:25:24,566
Mr. Melling.

361
00:25:24,775 --> 00:25:25,875
How are you?

362
00:25:30,614 --> 00:25:34,119
If you are Grace Hart,
I quit here and now.

363
00:25:36,622 --> 00:25:38,415
I'm having a bad hair day.

364
00:25:39,208 --> 00:25:41,084
Bad hair decade, really.

365
00:25:41,335 --> 00:25:43,003
I'm Eric Matthews. We spoke.

366
00:25:43,337 --> 00:25:44,838
Your hair is perfect.

367
00:25:45,006 --> 00:25:46,923
However, I can't accept this job.

368
00:25:47,174 --> 00:25:50,010
There's no way I can make
this woman ready in two days.

369
00:25:50,344 --> 00:25:53,763
Please, Mr. Melling,
give it a chance. Sit down.

370
00:25:53,973 --> 00:25:56,224
Have lunch. Totally on the Bureau.

371
00:25:56,809 --> 00:25:59,978
I suppose that would be
the civilized thing to do.

372
00:26:01,522 --> 00:26:05,358
I'll take a rain check.
I got to take care of some FBI stuff.

373
00:26:05,526 --> 00:26:08,361
That thing I told you
about that I gotta do.

374
00:26:08,529 --> 00:26:11,531
But I'll see you later.
We'll hang out. You like caps?

375
00:26:12,283 --> 00:26:14,367
I'll get you an official FBI cap.

376
00:26:15,036 --> 00:26:16,244
See you later.

377
00:26:17,288 --> 00:26:18,455
What a pity.

378
00:26:19,624 --> 00:26:21,541
- Are you hungry?
- Yeah.

379
00:26:21,751 --> 00:26:23,752
- Yes.
- Yeah.

380
00:26:24,045 --> 00:26:27,380
It is always "yes,"
never "yeah." Sit down.

381
00:26:28,674 --> 00:26:32,677
Miss United States is always
well-spoken and polite.

382
00:26:32,887 --> 00:26:34,137
Do you understand?

383
00:26:34,347 --> 00:26:35,680
Watch the hands, garÃ§on.

384
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:37,517
- Excuse me.
- It's all right.

385
00:26:38,061 --> 00:26:41,229
I have a feeling we're going to need
a drop cloth later.

386
00:26:54,077 --> 00:26:56,495
VICTOR: Could I have another
cabernet sauvignon?

387
00:26:56,704 --> 00:26:58,246
Another keg for you?

388
00:26:58,665 --> 00:27:01,333
- I'm good, thanks.
- That's okay, Philip.

389
00:27:01,584 --> 00:27:05,253
So, how long have you been doing
this pageant-training thing?

390
00:27:05,421 --> 00:27:06,521
I'm sorry?

391
00:27:07,006 --> 00:27:11,426
What was the question? I was
distracted by a half-masticated cow...

392
00:27:11,678 --> 00:27:14,596
...rolling around
in your wide-open trap.

393
00:27:14,847 --> 00:27:16,598
Excuse me? What is your problem?

394
00:27:16,849 --> 00:27:17,949
- Problem?
- Yeah.

395
00:27:18,184 --> 00:27:20,727
I mean, yes.
Have I offended you in some way?

396
00:27:20,937 --> 00:27:24,940
You've been completely antagonistic
to me from the second I walked in.

397
00:27:25,191 --> 00:27:27,901
I was once the most
sought-after, highly paid...

398
00:27:28,111 --> 00:27:30,237
...consultant in pageant history.

399
00:27:30,446 --> 00:27:32,447
I had no idea.

400
00:27:33,616 --> 00:27:37,452
Every season, girls would plead
with me to train them.

401
00:27:37,745 --> 00:27:39,913
Ten out of 11 years...

402
00:27:40,123 --> 00:27:42,124
...my girls were crowned.

403
00:27:42,375 --> 00:27:45,838
The year we lost,
the winner was a deaf-mute.

404
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:47,756
You can't beat that.

405
00:27:50,301 --> 00:27:51,401
Then...

406
00:27:52,345 --> 00:27:53,971
...in '96...

407
00:27:54,389 --> 00:27:58,058
...my girl froze like a puddle halfway
through her aria from La BohÃ¨me.

408
00:27:58,601 --> 00:28:01,895
Afterwards, she told
a reporter from Pageant Magazine...

409
00:28:02,105 --> 00:28:03,856
...that I was a perfectionist...

410
00:28:04,065 --> 00:28:07,735
...who had harangued her
to within an inch of her sanity.

411
00:28:08,111 --> 00:28:11,488
Of course,
after that article came out...

412
00:28:13,074 --> 00:28:14,825
...nobody wanted me.

413
00:28:18,913 --> 00:28:21,665
Okay. With all due respect here...

414
00:28:21,916 --> 00:28:24,376
...why did Miss Morningside
suggest you?

415
00:28:24,627 --> 00:28:27,337
Because I am the best.

416
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:35,179
Or perhaps it's because everyone else
worth having had a contestant.

417
00:28:35,805 --> 00:28:39,767
They had their Southern belles,
their Midwestern farmers' daughters.

418
00:28:39,976 --> 00:28:42,895
Spunky Western cowgirls.

419
00:28:43,146 --> 00:28:44,246
And I have...

420
00:28:46,316 --> 00:28:47,816
...Dirty Harriet.

421
00:28:51,865 --> 00:28:53,616
Will you desist?

422
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:55,050
Yeah.

423
00:28:55,202 --> 00:28:56,786
Yes.

424
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,459
Oh, my God.

425
00:29:03,668 --> 00:29:05,878
I haven't seen a walk like that
since Jurassic Park.

426
00:29:06,046 --> 00:29:10,132
It's been working really well for me
for the past 30 years, all right?

427
00:29:10,342 --> 00:29:12,301
Well, glide, now. Glide.

428
00:29:13,845 --> 00:29:15,387
Don't look down, don't look down.

429
00:29:15,555 --> 00:29:20,142
Don't look down, look up. Your chin
should be parallel to the floor.

430
00:29:20,352 --> 00:29:21,936
Now glide. Glide.

431
00:29:22,687 --> 00:29:25,064
It's not the bloody Ice Capades.

432
00:29:25,315 --> 00:29:26,816
Gliding.

433
00:29:27,651 --> 00:29:31,070
No, no. Don't pick your feet up.
Don't pick your feet up.

434
00:29:31,404 --> 00:29:32,822
Why are you picking your feet up?

435
00:29:33,073 --> 00:29:34,824
Because I'm preparing to run away.

436
00:29:35,033 --> 00:29:36,700
- No, wait. Wait.
- What?

437
00:29:36,868 --> 00:29:37,968
Watch me.

438
00:29:38,078 --> 00:29:39,829
Glide. Glide.

439
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,167
See? Glide.

440
00:29:45,377 --> 00:29:48,087
It's all in the buttocks.
Don't I look pretty?

441
00:29:48,547 --> 00:29:51,257
It takes a very secure man
to walk like that.

442
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,597
Roll your hips.

443
00:29:56,849 --> 00:29:59,684
Head up, head up. Keep gliding...

444
00:30:00,602 --> 00:30:01,894
I'm gliding here!

445
00:30:02,104 --> 00:30:03,258
CABBIE:
What are you, blind?

446
00:30:03,397 --> 00:30:04,772
Asshole.

447
00:30:39,808 --> 00:30:42,643
VICTOR:
Look how she walks. She's floating.

448
00:30:42,895 --> 00:30:46,230
Lightly ascending
from cloud to cloud...

449
00:30:46,607 --> 00:30:48,149
...towards heaven.

450
00:30:49,818 --> 00:30:52,069
He takes one look at that fake rack...

451
00:30:52,279 --> 00:30:54,155
...he's gonna send her right back.

452
00:30:57,117 --> 00:31:00,955
Look, she's gonna cry again.
"If I only had a brain!"

453
00:31:01,957 --> 00:31:04,626
I am somewhat less than amused.

454
00:31:12,509 --> 00:31:14,135
How's she doing?

455
00:31:15,346 --> 00:31:17,555
With some intensive work...

456
00:31:17,848 --> 00:31:21,100
...she'll be ready for the world's
finest trailer park.

457
00:31:22,061 --> 00:31:23,311
Thank you!

458
00:31:27,608 --> 00:31:29,192
Both painful...

459
00:31:29,443 --> 00:31:30,944
...and grotesque.

460
00:31:31,362 --> 00:31:32,695
Isn't it?

461
00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:38,826
Oh, my God!

462
00:31:49,046 --> 00:31:52,340
Mr. Vic, we got everything
you asked for. Where do we start?

463
00:31:52,549 --> 00:31:54,676
Teeth, hair, manicure, pedicure.

464
00:31:54,885 --> 00:31:56,094
Which one first?

465
00:31:56,345 --> 00:31:58,638
What are you gonna do to my teeth?

466
00:31:58,847 --> 00:32:02,225
Hopefully, remove the beer
stains and steak residue.

467
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,231
Can't I get some Novocain?

468
00:32:06,482 --> 00:32:07,899
It's only a cleaning.

469
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:10,402
Sweeney Todd, what are you doing?

470
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:12,529
Your hair should make a statement.

471
00:32:12,738 --> 00:32:15,615
As long as it's not,
"Thanks for the Country Music Award."

472
00:32:15,825 --> 00:32:17,909
You'll be lucky
if I can get it untangled.

473
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:19,219
No mercy.

474
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:20,578
Can I borrow that drill?

475
00:32:23,165 --> 00:32:25,333
Attention. Attention.

476
00:32:25,584 --> 00:32:29,754
All hair removal units,
wax, electrolysis, laser...

477
00:32:29,922 --> 00:32:33,008
...to commence at 2300 hours.

478
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,240
HART:
Hello. Ah!

479
00:32:54,947 --> 00:32:56,114
Bikini wax.

480
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:09,169
How you doing?

481
00:33:09,378 --> 00:33:10,922
Ever seen one this big?

482
00:33:11,132 --> 00:33:12,674
Sandwich, I mean.

483
00:33:13,092 --> 00:33:14,885
That's a lot of meat.

484
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:20,807
Thank you!

485
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,477
Nobody said this job was easy.

486
00:33:26,731 --> 00:33:29,274
Mm, mm, mm.

487
00:33:37,658 --> 00:33:41,453
This earpiece lets you hear anybody
on our frequencies.

488
00:33:41,704 --> 00:33:44,498
I don't need it. With all this foil,
I'm getting HBO.

489
00:33:45,917 --> 00:33:47,334
This is a pin camera.

490
00:33:47,585 --> 00:33:49,503
There's an actual lens in there.

491
00:33:49,712 --> 00:33:52,589
It provides a digital video
feed to our hookups.

492
00:33:53,466 --> 00:33:55,258
Here's your new IDs.

493
00:33:55,468 --> 00:33:57,594
Pageant identity.

494
00:33:58,471 --> 00:34:00,097
Gracie Lou Freebush?

495
00:34:00,431 --> 00:34:01,807
I remembered you liked that.

496
00:34:02,016 --> 00:34:05,310
Well, my IQ just dropped 10 points.

497
00:34:08,856 --> 00:34:11,358
More... fluffy.

498
00:34:11,859 --> 00:34:14,653
Eyebrows. There should be two.

499
00:34:19,702 --> 00:34:21,870
Another two coats. And a sealant.

500
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:23,664
Unbelievable.

501
00:34:25,542 --> 00:34:29,169
Where the hell is she? What could
possibly be taking this long?

502
00:35:03,246 --> 00:35:04,746
Hart, is that you?

503
00:35:04,914 --> 00:35:08,083
I'm in a dress, I have gel in my hair,
I haven't slept...

504
00:35:08,334 --> 00:35:11,670
...I'm starved and I'm armed.
Don't mess with me.

505
00:35:12,088 --> 00:35:13,422
Ooh.

506
00:35:14,924 --> 00:35:17,176
I'm fine. I'm cool. I'm good.

507
00:35:18,386 --> 00:35:22,016
Yeah, that's her.
Mr. Vic, nice work!

508
00:35:22,225 --> 00:35:23,392
Thank you.

509
00:35:24,686 --> 00:35:26,312
My God, I'm good.

510
00:36:04,809 --> 00:36:06,936
Okay, Gracie Lou, listen up.

511
00:36:07,354 --> 00:36:09,772
"Operation Thong" has commenced.

512
00:36:11,107 --> 00:36:12,900
Why don't you stun-gun yourself?

513
00:36:13,568 --> 00:36:15,444
I knew she'd like that one.

514
00:36:16,655 --> 00:36:17,863
KATHY:
Victor?

515
00:36:18,365 --> 00:36:20,115
Try not to speak.

516
00:36:20,825 --> 00:36:22,159
Victor!

517
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:25,162
Miss Morningside, if it's possible...

518
00:36:25,413 --> 00:36:27,500
...you look more radiant than ever.

519
00:36:28,502 --> 00:36:31,128
Then I guess it's possible.
Hello.

520
00:36:31,463 --> 00:36:32,563
Hi.

521
00:36:34,633 --> 00:36:35,733
Miss Hart?!

522
00:36:36,301 --> 00:36:38,135
I mean, Miss Freebush.

523
00:36:39,263 --> 00:36:43,182
Victor, I see you haven't
completely lost your touch.

524
00:36:43,433 --> 00:36:45,309
You look absolutely perfect.

525
00:36:45,602 --> 00:36:48,938
And you're just in time
for the orientation breakfast.

526
00:36:49,606 --> 00:36:51,399
You'll take the bags to the room?

527
00:36:51,608 --> 00:36:53,818
It's been a while
since you've been with us...

528
00:36:54,027 --> 00:36:56,320
...but you remember
how everything goes.

529
00:36:57,155 --> 00:37:00,324
One little mistake
and I'm a bloody bellhop.

530
00:37:01,994 --> 00:37:04,203
Ohio. Oh-hi-yo!

531
00:37:04,496 --> 00:37:06,455
Washington. Nice apples.

532
00:37:06,665 --> 00:37:09,625
Original. You come up with that
all by yourself?

533
00:37:11,211 --> 00:37:13,796
- Miss Freebush!
- I got it. I got it.

534
00:37:14,006 --> 00:37:16,048
New Jersey? Welcome.

535
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:30,187
- Who's she?
- Have you seen her before?

536
00:37:33,652 --> 00:37:36,362
Oh, hey, New Jersey?
This one's empty.

537
00:37:38,741 --> 00:37:39,841
Thanks.

538
00:37:40,034 --> 00:37:42,577
- I'm Cheryl from Rhode Island.
- Hi, I'm...

539
00:37:42,745 --> 00:37:46,497
Gracie Lou Freebush. I memorized
the orientation pamphlet.

540
00:37:46,749 --> 00:37:49,417
I know all 49 ladies
by name and picture.

541
00:37:49,585 --> 00:37:51,336
Fifty, including myself.

542
00:37:51,545 --> 00:37:55,715
Your picture wasn't there, so I knew
it was you from your lack of picture.

543
00:37:57,009 --> 00:38:00,345
How about a little song for the drive?

544
00:38:00,554 --> 00:38:03,056
I think you know the one I mean.

545
00:38:04,391 --> 00:38:07,894
From sea to shining sea

546
00:38:08,103 --> 00:38:11,522
Like Lady Liberty

547
00:38:11,732 --> 00:38:16,569
She reigns over all she sees

548
00:38:17,404 --> 00:38:20,990
She's beauty and she's grace

549
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,534
She's Miss United States

550
00:38:28,082 --> 00:38:29,540
Entering Barbie-town.

551
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:31,209
We're up and running.

552
00:38:31,418 --> 00:38:33,086
CLONSKY:
I love my job!

553
00:38:33,295 --> 00:38:35,088
- Not a bad view.
- Not at all.

554
00:38:35,297 --> 00:38:37,757
There's our table!

555
00:38:38,052 --> 00:38:40,104
I got here three days early
so I could...

556
00:38:40,221 --> 00:38:42,972
Look at all the hoochie mama!

557
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,432
Not the pastry!

558
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:51,147
Ladies, I would like you to meet
Gracie Lou Freebush from New Jersey.

559
00:38:51,399 --> 00:38:53,608
Karen Krantz, New York.

560
00:38:53,818 --> 00:38:55,110
What's up, Jersey?

561
00:38:55,319 --> 00:38:58,154
- Mary Jo Wright, Texas.
- Hi there.

562
00:38:58,322 --> 00:39:00,407
CHERYL: Belinda Brown, Tennessee.
- Hi.

563
00:39:00,616 --> 00:39:01,825
- I like that!
- Oh, yeah!

564
00:39:02,326 --> 00:39:04,160
Leslie Davis, California.

565
00:39:04,328 --> 00:39:05,428
Hey, girl.

566
00:39:05,621 --> 00:39:07,914
And Alana Krewson, Hawaii.

567
00:39:08,332 --> 00:39:09,432
Aloha.

568
00:39:09,583 --> 00:39:10,959
Aloha to you too!

569
00:39:11,168 --> 00:39:15,839
I want you all to know, I believe what
it says on the sign at the Alamodome.

570
00:39:16,048 --> 00:39:17,674
We are all winners.

571
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:20,510
Hey, Hart! You think she's hungry?

572
00:39:20,678 --> 00:39:24,180
Most important, we're getting our
issues out there for people to hear.

573
00:39:24,348 --> 00:39:27,100
And it's an honor
to have made it this far.

574
00:39:27,309 --> 00:39:29,769
Especially when you're
from a small state...

575
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:31,646
That's so true!

576
00:39:31,856 --> 00:39:34,274
- Us Rhode Islanders...
- I wasn't finished.

577
00:39:36,318 --> 00:39:37,610
Did it sound like I was?

578
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:38,945
I'm sorry.

579
00:39:39,155 --> 00:39:41,364
Why are you apologizing to her?

580
00:39:41,574 --> 00:39:43,618
She's been drinking
too much Coppertone.

581
00:39:43,828 --> 00:39:46,329
- Are you talking to me?
- Yeah, I am.

582
00:39:47,331 --> 00:39:48,431
Question:

583
00:39:49,542 --> 00:39:53,086
In Hawaii, don't you use "Aloha"
for hello and goodbye?

584
00:39:53,629 --> 00:39:55,046
So?

585
00:39:55,715 --> 00:39:58,967
If you're on the phone with
someone who won't stop talking...

586
00:39:59,177 --> 00:40:01,636
...and you say "aloha,"
don't they start again?

587
00:40:08,352 --> 00:40:10,395
At least she thinks I'm funny.

588
00:40:11,063 --> 00:40:12,981
Hart? Hart, do you copy?

589
00:40:14,108 --> 00:40:16,401
- What's up?
- I don't know. It's not working.

590
00:40:16,611 --> 00:40:20,238
- It worked five minutes ago.
- Who put it together?

591
00:40:25,203 --> 00:40:27,329
Check one, check one...

592
00:40:29,749 --> 00:40:32,334
Thank you so much. Thank you.

593
00:40:33,044 --> 00:40:34,669
For the past 21 years...

594
00:40:34,879 --> 00:40:38,256
...it has been my honor to serve
as director of this pageant.

595
00:40:38,424 --> 00:40:42,093
And I know that this year will be
our most exciting event ever!

596
00:40:45,389 --> 00:40:47,641
Couple of geniuses I'm working with.

597
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:51,855
After the rehearsal and a photo shoot,
you can settle into your rooms.

598
00:40:52,065 --> 00:40:55,442
Tomorrow we will
begin the preliminaries...

599
00:40:55,693 --> 00:40:58,111
...hosted by our
master of ceremonies...

600
00:40:58,279 --> 00:41:01,240
...an American institution,
Stan Fields.

601
00:41:06,412 --> 00:41:08,956
Thank you! Oh, thank you, Kathy!

602
00:41:10,542 --> 00:41:12,626
Let's go! Get it back online!

603
00:41:12,794 --> 00:41:14,376
- We're working on it.
- We're trying.

604
00:41:14,546 --> 00:41:16,046
Thank you, Kathy.

605
00:41:16,297 --> 00:41:18,465
Isn't she ravishing?!

606
00:41:19,634 --> 00:41:21,593
How does she do it?

607
00:41:21,803 --> 00:41:26,682
I look in the mirror and say,
"Who's that old man in my pajamas?"

608
00:41:29,894 --> 00:41:34,231
And even though I'll be
retiring this year...

609
00:41:36,234 --> 00:41:38,986
Well, don't cry for me... Alabama.

610
00:41:39,696 --> 00:41:42,489
That's so sad. He's retiring.

611
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:44,491
He's not retiring.

612
00:41:44,742 --> 00:41:47,703
I spoke to him this morning,
and he blurted it out.

613
00:41:47,912 --> 00:41:52,291
They're firing him, going
for someone newer and younger.

614
00:41:53,293 --> 00:41:55,629
I hope it's Ricky Martin.

615
00:41:56,506 --> 00:41:57,840
Hey, hey, hey.

616
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:01,802
Jesus Christ!

617
00:42:03,221 --> 00:42:04,321
Oh.

618
00:42:07,517 --> 00:42:09,476
Oh, I uh...

619
00:42:10,604 --> 00:42:14,815
I'm sorry. I had a bite of my bagel
and I forgot to pray.

620
00:42:18,653 --> 00:42:20,863
Dear Jesus, please forgive me...

621
00:42:21,114 --> 00:42:24,617
...for not praying before I had
a bite of my bagel and schmeer.

622
00:42:24,826 --> 00:42:26,118
Thank you very much.

623
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:27,870
Amen.

624
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:26,530
- Hi!
- Hi.

625
00:43:26,682 --> 00:43:28,432
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

626
00:43:28,684 --> 00:43:31,102
Oh, no, I was just, you know...

627
00:43:31,436 --> 00:43:32,603
...grooming.

628
00:43:32,854 --> 00:43:35,606
I made some of my famous
hot chocolate.

629
00:43:38,568 --> 00:43:39,944
Oh, um...

630
00:43:40,821 --> 00:43:44,699
My roommate's asleep,
or she's starting to mold.

631
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:47,618
But do you want to come in?

632
00:43:57,796 --> 00:43:59,755
I asked some of the other girls...

633
00:43:59,965 --> 00:44:02,967
...but when they heard "chocolate"
they slammed their doors.

634
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:05,972
They didn't give me a chance
to say "nonfat."

635
00:44:07,474 --> 00:44:09,225
Well, here's to...

636
00:44:09,935 --> 00:44:11,352
...world peace.

637
00:44:11,854 --> 00:44:13,396
World peace.

638
00:44:15,441 --> 00:44:16,649
Mmm.

639
00:44:18,777 --> 00:44:19,877
Mm.

640
00:44:20,446 --> 00:44:21,546
Hot.

641
00:44:21,655 --> 00:44:22,822
I'm sorry.

642
00:44:23,574 --> 00:44:25,158
I have to tell you...

643
00:44:25,409 --> 00:44:29,746
...I thought it was really great
how you settled that argument today.

644
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,998
"Aloha, aloha."

645
00:44:32,166 --> 00:44:33,916
That's why you're gonna win.

646
00:44:34,418 --> 00:44:36,002
You're so clever.

647
00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:39,630
You should tell jokes for your talent.
What is your talent?

648
00:44:40,799 --> 00:44:43,259
It's... It's kind of like...

649
00:44:43,635 --> 00:44:46,387
It's, you know,
it's like a surprise.

650
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,431
- Oh.
- Yeah, yeah.

651
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,267
But don't worry,
it's nothing embarrassing.

652
00:44:51,685 --> 00:44:54,812
Not anything like baton twirling
or anything.

653
00:44:56,899 --> 00:44:59,025
So, what's your talent?

654
00:45:01,487 --> 00:45:03,780
Oh, Cheryl, I'm sorry.

655
00:45:05,032 --> 00:45:07,909
Twirling can be a real art.

656
00:45:08,118 --> 00:45:11,623
I saw this cheerleader doing it
at a football game.

657
00:45:11,832 --> 00:45:15,710
She lit her batons on fire
and did this sexy dance.

658
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,879
I wish I could do something like that.

659
00:45:18,047 --> 00:45:19,147
Why can't you?

660
00:45:19,381 --> 00:45:22,133
My parents don't like
anything ostentatious.

661
00:45:22,384 --> 00:45:24,677
And they really don't like fire.

662
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:31,059
Cheryl, I think you have as good
a chance as anyone to win.

663
00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:34,312
You believe in yourself
to have gotten this far, right?

664
00:45:35,147 --> 00:45:36,731
- Really?
- Yeah.

665
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:38,750
Wow.

666
00:45:39,985 --> 00:45:43,571
You're so nice and so smart
and so sensitive.

667
00:45:43,739 --> 00:45:45,490
You're definitely gonna win.

668
00:45:45,658 --> 00:45:46,758
That's it.

669
00:45:47,159 --> 00:45:51,162
Excuse me. I am in the middle
of a REM cycle over here.

670
00:45:51,372 --> 00:45:52,997
- Sorry.
- I'm sorry.

671
00:46:10,474 --> 00:46:12,016
Yes.

672
00:46:24,532 --> 00:46:26,616
Not happening.

673
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:32,956
- What?
- You took your earpiece out.

674
00:46:33,124 --> 00:46:34,708
- Vic needs you.
- Now?

675
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:37,586
- I haven't slept in two days!
- I'll give you a cookie.

676
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:40,005
It better be a big one.

677
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,718
You don't walk, you float.

678
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:48,054
Gently descending,
you don't look down.

679
00:46:48,264 --> 00:46:52,058
Go back up and do it again.
Never, ever look down, okay?

680
00:46:52,268 --> 00:46:54,394
Thighs touching...

681
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:57,314
- Touching, not clenching.
- I'm touching.

682
00:46:57,523 --> 00:47:01,526
There's a gap between knees and calves,
your calves and your ankles.

683
00:47:01,736 --> 00:47:05,322
Right now there's a huge gap between
my brain and my spinal cord.

684
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:08,658
Here. Take these.

685
00:47:27,347 --> 00:47:28,972
What, no armored car?

686
00:47:29,265 --> 00:47:31,266
That would be in my other dress.

687
00:47:31,935 --> 00:47:36,021
What are you planning to do
for your talent? Sing? Dance?

688
00:47:36,356 --> 00:47:38,190
Chew with your mouth closed?

689
00:47:38,358 --> 00:47:40,692
I'll do whatever you want, Yoda.

690
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:42,319
Oh, Lord.

691
00:47:43,947 --> 00:47:45,280
Agent Matthews!

692
00:47:45,615 --> 00:47:49,451
- This woman has no talent!
- Don't shout it in front of her.

693
00:47:49,661 --> 00:47:53,288
I wasn't told to provide a talent.
I can't do so in the next five hours!

694
00:47:53,581 --> 00:47:54,681
Wait a minute.

695
00:47:54,791 --> 00:47:56,208
What are you talking about?

696
00:47:56,376 --> 00:47:58,877
She'll be on-stage
with nothing to do...

697
00:47:59,128 --> 00:48:01,630
...but convert oxygen
into carbon dioxide!

698
00:48:01,881 --> 00:48:06,218
You said you couldn't make her pretty
in two days, but she's gorgeous.

699
00:48:06,469 --> 00:48:09,054
Compared to the car wreck
she was before.

700
00:48:09,305 --> 00:48:12,724
My duties are stated in a contract,
and I have fulfilled them.

701
00:48:12,892 --> 00:48:15,811
- You talent her up by tomorrow or...
- Are you threatening me?

702
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:19,398
- Listen to me, you old fruitcake!
- How dare you, you cupcake!

703
00:48:19,649 --> 00:48:23,819
There's something I know how to do.
I haven't done it since high school...

704
00:48:24,028 --> 00:48:27,614
- You're not having sex on this stage.
- I didn't know it was an option.

705
00:48:27,826 --> 00:48:30,494
This thing,
I just have to call room service.

706
00:48:31,079 --> 00:48:32,246
Miss Hart.

707
00:48:32,497 --> 00:48:33,747
Please.

708
00:48:37,377 --> 00:48:39,545
Thank you. And the other one.

709
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:43,440
Thank you.

710
00:48:50,432 --> 00:48:52,224
All right, all right, all right.

711
00:48:53,727 --> 00:48:56,228
Happy, you doughnut Nazi?

712
00:49:34,936 --> 00:49:37,688
Did I tell you Stan Fields
was getting fired?

713
00:49:37,939 --> 00:49:41,442
I'm on it. You just concentrate
on being Gracie Lou, all right.

714
00:49:42,235 --> 00:49:44,820
And by the way,
you're doing a great job.

715
00:49:45,489 --> 00:49:47,782
I thought the evening gown looked...

716
00:49:48,909 --> 00:49:51,827
- I totally bought it.
- I know, you think I'm gorgeous.

717
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:53,579
I don't think you're gorgeous.

718
00:49:53,914 --> 00:49:56,582
You think I'm gorgeous.

719
00:49:56,833 --> 00:49:59,210
You want to kiss me.

720
00:49:59,419 --> 00:50:01,003
You want to hug me...

721
00:50:01,254 --> 00:50:03,714
McDonald's more feminine.
I'd rather kiss him.

722
00:50:03,965 --> 00:50:07,301
- Love me.
You want to hug me.

723
00:50:07,511 --> 00:50:09,136
You want to smooch me.

724
00:50:19,106 --> 00:50:20,773
Enjoy the rest of your night.

725
00:50:34,746 --> 00:50:36,956
Gracie, you look so tired.

726
00:50:37,541 --> 00:50:39,627
Oh, she had a busy night.

727
00:50:39,837 --> 00:50:42,797
I saw that gentleman stop by the room.

728
00:50:42,965 --> 00:50:44,065
Gentleman?

729
00:50:44,216 --> 00:50:46,050
Uh-huh.

730
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:50,388
- No men in the room.
- It's different on the mainland.

731
00:50:50,556 --> 00:50:53,683
Hold on, ladies. Let's hear
her side of the story.

732
00:50:53,976 --> 00:50:55,393
You sleeping with a judge?

733
00:50:57,896 --> 00:50:59,272
Oh.

734
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:02,066
Oh, that guy? No.

735
00:51:02,317 --> 00:51:05,778
No, no, I was dating him
for a little while because...

736
00:51:05,988 --> 00:51:08,281
...he said he had
an incurable disease.

737
00:51:11,410 --> 00:51:13,786
I didn't realize it was stupidity.

738
00:51:13,996 --> 00:51:16,164
MARY JO: Oh, I know what that's like.
- All right.

739
00:51:16,373 --> 00:51:18,040
He is such a pathetic loser.

740
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:22,211
I'm sorry he's obsessed with me,
but at some point it's like, "Hello!"

741
00:51:22,421 --> 00:51:25,214
"Move on! Get over yourself!"

742
00:51:25,924 --> 00:51:27,800
His ego is this big.

743
00:51:28,010 --> 00:51:30,595
But his equipment is like this big!

744
00:51:31,763 --> 00:51:34,098
Good cover!
We worked that out together.

745
00:51:34,433 --> 00:51:36,100
Use it for a needle.

746
00:51:36,310 --> 00:51:38,519
Back to work.
Get ready for the Alamo.

747
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:42,356
Thank you. Thank you.

748
00:51:42,691 --> 00:51:47,363
And welcome to
the Miss United States Preliminary...

749
00:51:47,573 --> 00:51:50,867
...here at the beautiful
and historical Alamo!

750
00:51:53,454 --> 00:51:55,580
Prepare for what promises to be...

751
00:51:55,789 --> 00:51:59,709
...a day of astounding musical,
theatrical and dancing talent.

752
00:51:59,919 --> 00:52:02,629
And after I'm finished,
you can see the ladies.

753
00:52:02,838 --> 00:52:03,938
Oh, yes!

754
00:52:06,425 --> 00:52:08,051
And now, put it together...

755
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:11,888
...for Miss Mary Jo Wright from Texas!

756
00:52:14,350 --> 00:52:19,145
You light up my life

757
00:52:49,301 --> 00:52:51,137
What's her talent, bartending?

758
00:53:16,038 --> 00:53:21,001
I made it very clear you weren't
responsible for making her credible.

759
00:53:23,796 --> 00:53:26,047
I wish I could explain...

760
00:53:26,507 --> 00:53:28,967
...but there are no words.

761
00:53:42,023 --> 00:53:43,356
Eagle-Eye.

762
00:53:44,233 --> 00:53:46,943
You might want to check out
cowboy at 1:00.

763
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:50,196
My 1:00 or your 1:00?

764
00:53:50,448 --> 00:53:52,741
The one under the white Stetson.

765
00:53:52,992 --> 00:53:55,076
There's Stetsons everywhere.

766
00:53:58,374 --> 00:53:59,666
He's moving, he's moving.

767
00:54:00,043 --> 00:54:03,045
- Toward the stage.
- Hold on, we're checking it out.

768
00:54:03,671 --> 00:54:04,771
Guys.

769
00:54:09,552 --> 00:54:11,970
Guys, he has a gun. He has a gun.

770
00:54:12,889 --> 00:54:15,265
Who's got the 20 on the shooter?

771
00:54:17,393 --> 00:54:18,493
I'm taking him out.

772
00:54:18,686 --> 00:54:20,103
Wait for a visual!

773
00:54:22,106 --> 00:54:24,775
Gun! Gun! Everybody down!

774
00:54:28,738 --> 00:54:31,281
Better up to them, don't you think?

775
00:54:33,076 --> 00:54:36,370
In a bizarre incident at
the Miss United States Preliminaries...

776
00:54:36,579 --> 00:54:39,706
...the contestant from New Jersey
leapt off-stage...

777
00:54:39,916 --> 00:54:43,877
...and tackled a man in the crowd
who was trying to light a cigarette.

778
00:54:44,087 --> 00:54:46,505
She's here with me right now.

779
00:54:46,714 --> 00:54:50,050
What were you thinking when you
jumped off the stage?

780
00:54:50,259 --> 00:54:54,721
All the contestants are actively
involved in ending tobacco dependence.

781
00:54:54,931 --> 00:54:59,476
I think the gentleman will think twice
before he lights up again.

782
00:54:59,644 --> 00:55:01,397
I'm sure we all will.

783
00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:08,153
- Look, he had a gun.
- Of course.

784
00:55:08,405 --> 00:55:10,030
This is Texas, everyone has a gun.

785
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:11,824
My florist has a gun.

786
00:55:12,117 --> 00:55:13,242
I don't have a gun.

787
00:55:13,493 --> 00:55:15,119
My ancestors were Quakers.

788
00:55:15,328 --> 00:55:17,287
Stan, please!

789
00:55:17,622 --> 00:55:20,249
We assume any man
with a weapon is a suspect.

790
00:55:20,458 --> 00:55:22,084
We got the DNA results.

791
00:55:22,293 --> 00:55:25,421
The envelope from the Citizen
was licked by a woman.

792
00:55:25,672 --> 00:55:27,464
There's never been DNA before.

793
00:55:28,007 --> 00:55:30,342
He slipped up, or I should say "she."

794
00:55:30,593 --> 00:55:32,261
This is preposterous.

795
00:55:32,637 --> 00:55:34,680
You people are completely clueless.

796
00:55:34,931 --> 00:55:38,308
If I ran my pageant like this, we'd be
holding it in someone's basement!

797
00:55:38,518 --> 00:55:41,645
Every operation is bound
to have its screwups.

798
00:55:41,855 --> 00:55:44,314
As far as I can see,
she's still with us.

799
00:55:45,817 --> 00:55:46,984
Oh, God!

800
00:55:47,193 --> 00:55:50,362
Could I have a moment alone
with Miss Hart, please?

801
00:55:50,572 --> 00:55:51,697
Sure.

802
00:55:54,826 --> 00:55:56,493
Just for a tiny minute.

803
00:55:56,828 --> 00:55:59,329
We'll just be a moment.
Shop talk.

804
00:55:59,539 --> 00:56:00,639
Hair, gel, mousse.

805
00:56:03,042 --> 00:56:06,547
Look, I know I made a mistake.
I'm sorry.

806
00:56:09,217 --> 00:56:13,137
I've been fighting all my life
against your type.

807
00:56:13,346 --> 00:56:16,348
The ones who think we're
a bunch of worthless airheads.

808
00:56:16,892 --> 00:56:18,142
You know who I mean.

809
00:56:18,393 --> 00:56:19,727
Feminists...

810
00:56:19,978 --> 00:56:21,479
...intellectuals...

811
00:56:21,688 --> 00:56:22,813
...ugly women.

812
00:56:23,356 --> 00:56:25,733
I refuse to give in to their cynicism.

813
00:56:26,109 --> 00:56:30,571
That's why I have dedicated
my entire life to this scholarship.

814
00:56:31,239 --> 00:56:32,865
No one's going to ruin that.

815
00:56:33,867 --> 00:56:35,242
Not this year.

816
00:56:36,119 --> 00:56:38,662
You get in my way, I will kill you.

817
00:56:40,332 --> 00:56:41,624
Do you understand?

818
00:56:42,709 --> 00:56:43,809
Yeah.

819
00:56:44,002 --> 00:56:45,753
- Yes!
- Yes.

820
00:56:55,764 --> 00:56:56,864
Frank!

821
00:56:57,724 --> 00:57:02,353
The interview is the single most
important part of the pageant.

822
00:57:02,562 --> 00:57:05,272
It accounts for 30%
of your total score.

823
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:07,775
What's the other 70%, cleavage?

824
00:57:09,611 --> 00:57:13,241
Is this your idea of doing final preps
on the convention center?

825
00:57:13,867 --> 00:57:17,078
Look. Liberace's got her
in a nice evening gown.

826
00:57:17,538 --> 00:57:22,041
McDonald called. He saw Hart's anti-
smoking commercial. He's on his way.

827
00:57:22,292 --> 00:57:25,753
Good, perfect. I'd hate for him
to fire me over the phone.

828
00:57:25,963 --> 00:57:27,063
I can't believe this!

829
00:57:27,214 --> 00:57:28,314
It'll be ugly.

830
00:57:28,465 --> 00:57:29,565
No shit.

831
00:57:29,967 --> 00:57:32,301
I gotta do something.
I'm gonna go do laps.

832
00:57:32,469 --> 00:57:35,096
We'll go over tomorrow's assignments.

833
00:57:35,305 --> 00:57:36,430
You got it.

834
00:57:36,723 --> 00:57:38,099
Hands folded...

835
00:57:38,809 --> 00:57:40,726
...ankles crossed.

836
00:57:40,936 --> 00:57:42,061
Neck up!

837
00:57:42,271 --> 00:57:44,272
And remember, smile.

838
00:57:44,481 --> 00:57:48,109
Smilers wear a crown,
losers wear a frown.

839
00:57:48,443 --> 00:57:51,153
I would so love to hurt you right now.

840
00:57:51,321 --> 00:57:53,823
As long as you smile.

841
00:57:54,324 --> 00:57:55,424
Now...

842
00:57:55,826 --> 00:57:58,202
Why is New Jersey called...

843
00:57:58,495 --> 00:57:59,620
...the Garden State?

844
00:57:59,830 --> 00:58:04,333
You can't fit "Oil and petrochemical
refinery state" on a license plate?

845
00:58:04,585 --> 00:58:07,003
I don't appreciate your immaturity...

846
00:58:07,254 --> 00:58:09,171
...when I'm working as hard as I am.

847
00:58:09,339 --> 00:58:12,967
What's the big deal?
It's fixed, I'm in the top five.

848
00:58:13,176 --> 00:58:15,094
Congratulations to me.

849
00:58:15,304 --> 00:58:20,018
Is that enough? Have you no pride
in yourself, in your presentation?

850
00:58:20,311 --> 00:58:24,230
I'm an FBI agent, right? I'm not
a performing monkey in heels.

851
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:27,025
You're also a person,
and an incomplete one at that!

852
00:58:27,276 --> 00:58:30,862
In place of friends and relationships,
you have sarcasm and a gun.

853
00:58:31,030 --> 00:58:32,238
Oh, I have sarcasm?

854
00:58:32,448 --> 00:58:35,950
When every word that comes out of your
mouth is dripping with disdain?

855
00:58:36,243 --> 00:58:40,705
That is because I am a miserable,
grumpy elitist, and that works for me.

856
00:58:40,873 --> 00:58:43,750
I don't have relationships
because I don't want them.

857
00:58:43,959 --> 00:58:47,545
And I don't have friends
because I work 24-7.

858
00:58:47,755 --> 00:58:51,049
And you have no idea why I am
the way that I am.

859
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:54,385
As we're practicing interviews,
why are you the way you are?

860
00:58:54,637 --> 00:58:56,346
None of your damn business.

861
00:58:56,555 --> 00:58:59,390
The judges probably have
never heard that before.

862
00:58:59,558 --> 00:59:01,559
We have more to do here.

863
00:59:03,562 --> 00:59:05,521
No, we are finished.

864
00:59:06,899 --> 00:59:08,274
Finished.

865
00:59:10,819 --> 00:59:14,072
- Give me a 20 on Matthews.
- Be advised he's at the pool.

866
00:59:17,826 --> 00:59:20,078
"How do you feel about gun control?"

867
00:59:20,412 --> 00:59:21,788
Favorable.

868
00:59:30,925 --> 00:59:33,677
Thought I'd let you know
I was quitting. Take care.

869
00:59:34,345 --> 00:59:36,179
Hold on. Wait a minute.

870
00:59:36,806 --> 00:59:39,933
- What do you mean?
- I mean, you got the wrong girl.

871
00:59:40,101 --> 00:59:41,201
All right?

872
00:59:41,394 --> 00:59:42,519
I do not need this now.

873
00:59:42,770 --> 00:59:46,439
That's what I'm saying!
I'm totally screwing up in there!

874
00:59:46,607 --> 00:59:48,900
I don't feel
like a real agent anymore.

875
00:59:49,110 --> 00:59:51,611
I mean, Vic says
this thing that's so...

876
00:59:52,196 --> 00:59:55,407
I don't care what he said, you know?
I don't care.

877
00:59:55,616 --> 00:59:57,117
Because I am the job...

878
00:59:57,368 --> 00:59:59,911
...and I'm okay with that.
You're the job?

879
01:00:00,371 --> 01:00:02,455
Yeah, I'm the job.
We're all the job.

880
01:00:02,623 --> 01:00:04,582
Then what's wrong with me?

881
01:00:04,792 --> 01:00:08,461
I date. I know everyone thinks
I haven't had a date in 10 years.

882
01:00:08,713 --> 01:00:09,963
Is that what you think?

883
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:12,132
I think you date.

884
01:00:12,383 --> 01:00:13,883
Damn right I do.

885
01:00:14,385 --> 01:00:16,428
But both times it was screwed up.

886
01:00:17,638 --> 01:00:19,973
I don't even care.
All I want to do...

887
01:00:20,224 --> 01:00:22,058
...is my job.

888
01:00:22,309 --> 01:00:25,478
For the last three days
I feel like I'm completely lost.

889
01:00:25,730 --> 01:00:28,481
I've been waiting five years
to run my own op.

890
01:00:28,735 --> 01:00:31,778
- Would I blow it on the wrong girl?
- You picked me...

891
01:00:31,988 --> 01:00:34,948
...because I looked good
and wasn't on maternity leave.

892
01:00:35,158 --> 01:00:38,160
No, that's why they let me pick you.
Know why?

893
01:00:38,411 --> 01:00:40,162
- Lost a bet.
- You're smart...

894
01:00:40,371 --> 01:00:44,791
...and funny and you're easy
to talk to when you're unarmed.

895
01:00:45,752 --> 01:00:48,920
Give yourself a break
and cut Vic some slack.

896
01:00:49,130 --> 01:00:51,590
Because if they see
what I see, then...

897
01:00:52,967 --> 01:00:54,176
...they'll love you.

898
01:00:58,181 --> 01:00:59,514
So, what do you say?

899
01:01:05,897 --> 01:01:07,189
I won't let you down.

900
01:01:07,482 --> 01:01:09,191
Good, that's what I want to hear.

901
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:12,444
In all honesty, I might let you down.

902
01:01:12,695 --> 01:01:15,906
But I'll try my best not to.

903
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:20,619
Do not mess with the dress.

904
01:01:27,376 --> 01:01:30,045
Oh, Vic is gonna kill you.

905
01:01:31,047 --> 01:01:32,672
You in big trouble.

906
01:01:32,882 --> 01:01:34,510
Why? You fell.

907
01:01:34,719 --> 01:01:36,220
- You look good wet.
- Shut up!

908
01:01:50,235 --> 01:01:53,237
Whoa, guys, Hart's
in the dressing room. Come on.

909
01:01:53,446 --> 01:01:56,573
- You see the legs on that girl?
- Who's your daddy?

910
01:02:12,590 --> 01:02:14,258
Those better be candy dishes!

911
01:02:14,759 --> 01:02:15,859
Turn around.

912
01:02:18,263 --> 01:02:19,596
Open.

913
01:02:21,182 --> 01:02:23,600
This guy's like an inch from death!

914
01:02:24,894 --> 01:02:27,020
But what a way to go!

915
01:02:27,230 --> 01:02:29,940
- Break it up. Nothing to see.
- What do you mean?

916
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,067
She's a federal agent.
Come on.

917
01:02:35,196 --> 01:02:38,240
Guess it's time to apply
at my local Hooters.

918
01:02:38,616 --> 01:02:42,288
Hemorrhoid ointment? You think
the judges will look that closely?

919
01:02:42,497 --> 01:02:44,623
It's for the baggies under your eyes.

920
01:02:44,916 --> 01:02:46,016
Really?

921
01:02:47,419 --> 01:02:50,004
Good, hair spray.
Finally something I recognize.

922
01:02:51,089 --> 01:02:52,506
What are you doing?

923
01:02:52,716 --> 01:02:54,884
It stops the suit from riding up.

924
01:02:55,051 --> 01:02:56,151
Riding up where?

925
01:02:56,428 --> 01:02:58,304
Just up!

926
01:02:58,471 --> 01:02:59,571
That's enough!

927
01:02:59,723 --> 01:03:01,140
Why do you make things hard?

928
01:03:01,391 --> 01:03:04,894
I can see this is an incredibly
embarrassing situation for you.

929
01:03:05,145 --> 01:03:08,564
Why does Georgia get to wear
a one-piece and I have to wear this?!

930
01:03:08,773 --> 01:03:12,735
If you can do this, then you can
convince anyone that you belong here.

931
01:03:12,944 --> 01:03:14,528
Places, everybody! Let's go!

932
01:03:14,738 --> 01:03:20,075
The Swimsuit Preliminary accounts
for 15% of the total score...

933
01:03:20,327 --> 01:03:23,829
...and tests the grace,
athleticism and poise...

934
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:26,582
...of each lovely woman.

935
01:03:27,626 --> 01:03:30,669
The last time I was naked in public,
I came out of a uterus.

936
01:03:30,837 --> 01:03:34,089
I don't have breasts, my thighs...
I should wear a muumuu.

937
01:03:34,299 --> 01:03:36,550
I have avoided this experience
all my life.

938
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:39,553
And here it is.
You must achieve a Zen-like state.

939
01:03:39,763 --> 01:03:42,348
Listen to your breathing,
feel your heart...

940
01:03:42,599 --> 01:03:44,433
...think of the Dalai Lama.

941
01:04:04,373 --> 01:04:05,706
Texas!

942
01:04:10,629 --> 01:04:11,729
Rhode Island!

943
01:04:16,718 --> 01:04:18,219
New Jersey!

944
01:04:29,398 --> 01:04:31,983
Dalai Lama, Dalai Lama, Dalai Lama...

945
01:04:33,902 --> 01:04:35,152
New York!

946
01:04:39,366 --> 01:04:40,908
California!

947
01:04:45,122 --> 01:04:47,748
I would have to say,
world peace.

948
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,543
Definitely, world peace.

949
01:04:50,836 --> 01:04:53,548
That's easy. World peace.

950
01:04:53,882 --> 01:04:54,982
World peace.

951
01:04:55,134 --> 01:05:00,013
What is the one most important thing
our society needs?

952
01:05:01,181 --> 01:05:05,435
That would be harsher punishment
for parole violators, Stan.

953
01:05:11,525 --> 01:05:14,777
And, world peace.

954
01:05:20,034 --> 01:05:21,534
Thank you, Gracie Lou.

955
01:05:21,744 --> 01:05:23,369
And thank you, Stan.

956
01:05:25,456 --> 01:05:28,458
Cheryl Frasier from Rhode Island.

957
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:31,627
That was charming. Are you drunk?

958
01:05:31,795 --> 01:05:36,132
Glad you enjoyed it. Now excuse me,
I have to go unscrew my smile.

959
01:05:36,467 --> 01:05:38,176
We got a lead.

960
01:05:38,385 --> 01:05:40,303
- The blood test?
- Photos.

961
01:05:40,471 --> 01:05:43,473
Cheryl Frasier, with members
of a radical animal rights group...

962
01:05:43,682 --> 01:05:46,142
- ...involved in bombings.
- It's always the quiet ones.

963
01:05:46,310 --> 01:05:49,437
She fits the profile:
Loner, introverted.

964
01:05:49,688 --> 01:05:51,272
That Cheryl?

965
01:05:51,482 --> 01:05:55,068
Describe your perfect date.

966
01:05:56,489 --> 01:05:58,323
That's a tough one.

967
01:06:01,118 --> 01:06:03,995
I'd have to say April 25th...

968
01:06:04,288 --> 01:06:07,624
...because it's not too hot,
not too cold.

969
01:06:07,833 --> 01:06:10,335
All you need is a light jacket.

970
01:06:12,338 --> 01:06:14,839
Now, there is a hardened criminal.

971
01:06:16,342 --> 01:06:20,136
Maybe she's an accomplice.
Maybe she's his inside connection.

972
01:06:20,346 --> 01:06:22,514
That's what you gotta find out.

973
01:06:22,681 --> 01:06:23,781
How?

974
01:06:23,933 --> 01:06:26,351
Buddy up to her, you know, girl talk.

975
01:06:26,519 --> 01:06:28,770
- Girl talk?
- Yes, girl talk.

976
01:06:30,022 --> 01:06:32,023
Sorry, I'm totally drawing a blank.

977
01:06:32,233 --> 01:06:36,861
Leg waxing, fake orgasms,
the inability of men to commit.

978
01:06:37,029 --> 01:06:38,488
Why don't you talk to her?

979
01:06:39,824 --> 01:06:43,660
Lmagine she's me and you want to know,
but I don't want to talk about it.

980
01:06:43,869 --> 01:06:45,245
What would you do?

981
01:06:45,538 --> 01:06:47,122
You want me to beat her?

982
01:06:47,748 --> 01:06:48,873
Why don't you talk to her?

983
01:06:49,125 --> 01:06:51,376
Okay, forget about it. I will go.

984
01:06:52,044 --> 01:06:53,711
Put that back in your ear.

985
01:06:53,879 --> 01:06:56,047
I can't talk girl talk
with a guy in my head.

986
01:06:56,257 --> 01:06:58,383
I can't even do it with me in my head.

987
01:07:01,262 --> 01:07:02,764
Girl talk.

988
01:07:10,731 --> 01:07:12,190
Oh, my God!

989
01:07:12,483 --> 01:07:14,776
Hey, Rhode Island, how you doing?

990
01:07:14,986 --> 01:07:18,155
How can you ask that?
You heard my interview.

991
01:07:18,906 --> 01:07:21,283
I was like a female Rain Man.

992
01:07:21,492 --> 01:07:24,411
Oh, no, it def-def-definitely
wasn't Rain Man.

993
01:07:24,662 --> 01:07:26,163
Definitely not Rain Man.

994
01:07:26,414 --> 01:07:29,166
Come and have a midnight snack
with me and some...

995
01:07:29,417 --> 01:07:30,750
...girl talk.

996
01:07:30,918 --> 01:07:34,004
Are you crazy?
We can't have pizza and beer!

997
01:07:34,213 --> 01:07:36,882
Do you know how many calories
you're talking about?

998
01:07:37,091 --> 01:07:39,676
It's light beer and
she's gonna throw it up anyway.

999
01:07:39,844 --> 01:07:40,944
Come on.

1000
01:07:41,304 --> 01:07:43,763
Come with. No?

1001
01:07:43,931 --> 01:07:45,557
No takers? No?

1002
01:07:47,101 --> 01:07:48,935
All right, I'll just...

1003
01:07:49,187 --> 01:07:52,439
...sit here. You guys
go back on your bicycles...

1004
01:07:52,690 --> 01:07:56,943
...and I'll sit here with my
very large, cheesy pizza.

1005
01:07:57,320 --> 01:07:59,362
Oh, look at all that cheese.

1006
01:07:59,572 --> 01:08:00,672
Mmm, mm, mm.

1007
01:08:00,865 --> 01:08:02,782
Cheryl, don't.

1008
01:08:02,950 --> 01:08:05,285
At least scrape off the toppings.

1009
01:08:05,453 --> 01:08:09,208
First step, pizza.
Second step, flaming batons...

1010
01:08:13,755 --> 01:08:16,048
Let me have some. Oh, yeah.

1011
01:08:16,216 --> 01:08:18,550
I guess we'll be needing more pizza.

1012
01:08:36,361 --> 01:08:39,279
- I want another drink!
- Okay!

1013
01:08:39,989 --> 01:08:41,657
We're gonna get a drink.

1014
01:08:58,925 --> 01:09:00,926
Another round, ladies?

1015
01:09:01,678 --> 01:09:04,263
- I can't do another one!
- Yes, you can!

1016
01:09:13,022 --> 01:09:14,358
This is so weird!

1017
01:09:14,526 --> 01:09:17,319
This is my third one
and I don't feel a thing!

1018
01:09:17,529 --> 01:09:18,629
Really?

1019
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:21,031
Like when I did my interview question.

1020
01:09:21,324 --> 01:09:23,158
Don't worry, we all sucked.

1021
01:09:23,535 --> 01:09:27,204
You know, I had such a good answer
to that question too.

1022
01:09:27,414 --> 01:09:30,541
My idea of a perfect date
would be a man...

1023
01:09:30,834 --> 01:09:32,960
...who takes me to a romantic dinner.

1024
01:09:33,211 --> 01:09:36,380
Then we walk along the beach barefoot,
discussing books...

1025
01:09:36,548 --> 01:09:39,508
...and music and movies!

1026
01:09:39,718 --> 01:09:40,926
Aw.

1027
01:09:41,136 --> 01:09:42,511
No wonder you're still a virgin.

1028
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:48,058
Time to paint. Come on.

1029
01:09:48,226 --> 01:09:49,852
No, my contacts.

1030
01:09:51,438 --> 01:09:53,355
- We'll stay here.
- I want more pizza.

1031
01:09:53,565 --> 01:09:55,733
We're gonna have more pizza and beer.

1032
01:09:58,320 --> 01:09:59,653
Have fun!

1033
01:10:00,071 --> 01:10:03,198
- This is so much fun.
- Yeah, it's fun.

1034
01:10:03,408 --> 01:10:05,451
It's so fun it should be illegal.

1035
01:10:05,744 --> 01:10:08,579
Speaking of illegal,
have you ever, like...

1036
01:10:08,830 --> 01:10:10,205
...committed a crime?

1037
01:10:11,374 --> 01:10:12,666
Yes!

1038
01:10:13,752 --> 01:10:15,419
Yes, I did.

1039
01:10:17,672 --> 01:10:18,841
Go on.

1040
01:10:20,260 --> 01:10:23,763
One time I stole red underwear
from the department store.

1041
01:10:24,056 --> 01:10:25,765
My mother wouldn't buy them!

1042
01:10:26,058 --> 01:10:28,768
She said they were Satan's panties.

1043
01:10:31,521 --> 01:10:33,606
- So is that it?
- Yeah.

1044
01:10:33,857 --> 01:10:37,109
Oh, there was
this one thing in college...

1045
01:10:37,277 --> 01:10:39,278
...with my lit professor.

1046
01:10:39,529 --> 01:10:44,408
One day I came to his office. He said
he wanted to discuss a paper I wrote.

1047
01:10:45,369 --> 01:10:47,870
He wanted to discuss a paper, right?

1048
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:50,790
Hey, can I get another
one of these tubie things?

1049
01:10:51,041 --> 01:10:53,000
Yeah, can we get another tubie?

1050
01:10:54,002 --> 01:10:56,212
Anyway, he attacked me.

1051
01:10:58,799 --> 01:11:01,300
Cheryl, did you report him?

1052
01:11:01,551 --> 01:11:04,595
No, I never told anyone before this.

1053
01:11:04,888 --> 01:11:07,139
I know that happens all the time.

1054
01:11:07,307 --> 01:11:09,642
No, it doesn't! Cheryl, it doesn't.

1055
01:11:09,810 --> 01:11:12,770
There are so many maneuvers
that I could show you.

1056
01:11:13,021 --> 01:11:14,146
Really?

1057
01:11:14,314 --> 01:11:16,565
Yeah! Come on, get up.

1058
01:11:18,652 --> 01:11:20,820
I want you to firmly plant your feet.

1059
01:11:21,029 --> 01:11:22,655
I'm gonna move the chair.

1060
01:11:22,906 --> 01:11:24,742
Now if someone comes at you...

1061
01:11:31,834 --> 01:11:34,168
She's completely trashed.

1062
01:11:34,420 --> 01:11:37,797
We should get her back
before Miss Morningside finds out.

1063
01:11:38,048 --> 01:11:40,842
Kathy's got a boot up her ass
about something.

1064
01:11:41,093 --> 01:11:43,970
I don't think she ever
got over those rumors.

1065
01:11:44,179 --> 01:11:45,346
Come again?

1066
01:11:45,556 --> 01:11:47,515
Her pageant years
she was a runner-up.

1067
01:11:47,683 --> 01:11:50,643
But then the winner mysteriously
got food poisoning.

1068
01:11:50,853 --> 01:11:52,061
Bizarro!

1069
01:11:52,271 --> 01:11:55,690
No, Stan told me she got a letter
a few weeks back from the network...

1070
01:11:55,941 --> 01:11:58,359
...and they're firing her too!

1071
01:11:58,569 --> 01:12:01,696
She threw a chair out the window!

1072
01:12:03,115 --> 01:12:04,866
We gotta go. Come on.

1073
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:07,702
I got 20 people here
waiting for confirmation.

1074
01:12:13,584 --> 01:12:15,793
Don't tell me I don't understand.

1075
01:12:16,003 --> 01:12:18,087
I hate when I don't see
a wet paint sign.

1076
01:12:18,297 --> 01:12:19,464
Stop it. Listen.

1077
01:12:19,715 --> 01:12:23,092
- Can't hear you, took out my earpiece.
- I have a lead and it's not Cheryl.

1078
01:12:23,302 --> 01:12:25,720
Forget it. They bagged the Citizen.

1079
01:12:26,138 --> 01:12:27,597
What? Where?

1080
01:12:28,223 --> 01:12:29,851
It's confirmed.

1081
01:12:30,186 --> 01:12:32,228
He was holing up in a shack in Nevada.

1082
01:12:32,813 --> 01:12:35,190
Place had enough C4
to make a new Grand Canyon.

1083
01:12:35,399 --> 01:12:37,233
Let's pack up and get out of here.

1084
01:12:38,611 --> 01:12:41,571
Sir, I need to talk to you.
One second of your time.

1085
01:12:42,156 --> 01:12:43,740
- Hart.
- Hear me out a second.

1086
01:12:43,991 --> 01:12:48,203
I feel the situation bears further
scrutiny and our continued presence.

1087
01:12:48,412 --> 01:12:51,664
Do you have paint in your ears?
We caught the guy!

1088
01:12:51,874 --> 01:12:54,876
I respect what you're saying.
I'd say the same to me...

1089
01:12:55,127 --> 01:12:57,003
...but what if we were wrong?

1090
01:12:57,546 --> 01:13:00,924
What if the Citizen didn't send it?
What if it was a copycat?

1091
01:13:01,842 --> 01:13:04,219
The letter didn't follow
the normal pattern.

1092
01:13:04,428 --> 01:13:06,596
The linguistic scheme
was uncharacteristic...

1093
01:13:06,764 --> 01:13:09,140
...and the DNA said it was a woman!

1094
01:13:09,725 --> 01:13:12,519
Maybe he got his girlfriend
to lick the envelope.

1095
01:13:12,728 --> 01:13:15,021
I think we have reason
to monitor Morningside.

1096
01:13:15,231 --> 01:13:18,608
Why don't you jump on her
dressed like a Bavarian fruitcake?

1097
01:13:18,776 --> 01:13:21,569
You're the reason I had
to drag myself down here...

1098
01:13:21,779 --> 01:13:23,947
...and I don't want to hear anymore!

1099
01:13:24,198 --> 01:13:26,908
You're absolutely right, sir.
Not another damn word.

1100
01:13:27,159 --> 01:13:28,259
Thank you.

1101
01:13:28,661 --> 01:13:31,788
But she's getting fired this year,
which she didn't tell us.

1102
01:13:32,039 --> 01:13:35,041
You're already in enough
trouble with the review board.

1103
01:13:35,253 --> 01:13:38,880
Yeah, but when she was in the pageant,
the only reason she won was...

1104
01:13:39,090 --> 01:13:42,801
...because the winner got
food poisoning. How bizarro is that?

1105
01:13:43,052 --> 01:13:44,261
- "Bizarro"?
- Oh! Oh!

1106
01:13:44,470 --> 01:13:48,265
She threatened me. According to Mary
Jo, she has a history of violence.

1107
01:13:48,474 --> 01:13:49,683
Who is Mary Jo?

1108
01:13:49,892 --> 01:13:52,477
Are you getting your information
from a pajama party?

1109
01:13:52,728 --> 01:13:54,062
Would you shut up?

1110
01:13:54,313 --> 01:13:56,481
You're shutting up enough
for both of us.

1111
01:13:56,691 --> 01:13:57,791
- Matthews.
- Yes, sir?

1112
01:13:57,942 --> 01:14:00,068
Is there any reason
to suspect Morningside?

1113
01:14:06,993 --> 01:14:08,093
No, sir.

1114
01:14:12,123 --> 01:14:13,223
There.

1115
01:14:13,332 --> 01:14:16,585
I request permission to stay
with a small contingent.

1116
01:14:16,752 --> 01:14:20,338
- Denied.
- Then I request permission to stay alone.

1117
01:14:20,631 --> 01:14:25,010
You know what, I don't care
what you do. You want to stay, stay!

1118
01:14:25,219 --> 01:14:28,513
But as a private citizen.
Turn in your badge and your gun.

1119
01:14:29,265 --> 01:14:32,017
Everybody, I suggest we start packing.

1120
01:14:35,771 --> 01:14:36,871
What?

1121
01:14:37,106 --> 01:14:39,232
Don't look at me like I betrayed you.

1122
01:14:39,483 --> 01:14:41,445
Betrayal implies action.
You stood there.

1123
01:14:41,654 --> 01:14:43,155
You got nothing to go on.

1124
01:14:43,364 --> 01:14:45,532
I know everyone thinks I'm a screwup.

1125
01:14:45,783 --> 01:14:49,244
But I feel like I'm in the right
place at the right time.

1126
01:14:49,454 --> 01:14:52,539
I have to protect those girls.
It is my job.

1127
01:14:52,749 --> 01:14:54,074
Part of it is following orders.

1128
01:14:54,292 --> 01:14:58,170
The other part is using your brain.
Throw out the rule book...

1129
01:14:58,379 --> 01:15:01,381
I like the book. I like knowing
what I can and cannot do.

1130
01:15:01,633 --> 01:15:03,759
You're not the only one who lives
for the job.

1131
01:15:03,968 --> 01:15:06,970
I want to keep mine
for the next 20 or 30 years.

1132
01:15:08,222 --> 01:15:09,806
Jesus, Hart.

1133
01:15:10,016 --> 01:15:11,266
Give it a rest.

1134
01:15:11,476 --> 01:15:13,268
Sure, give it a rest.

1135
01:15:15,271 --> 01:15:16,521
What are you doing?

1136
01:15:18,066 --> 01:15:19,566
Don't do it.

1137
01:16:02,696 --> 01:16:04,071
Thank you.

1138
01:16:05,115 --> 01:16:07,241
Thank you so much.

1139
01:16:09,077 --> 01:16:10,744
I can't believe it!

1140
01:16:14,332 --> 01:16:15,624
Hi, Mom.

1141
01:16:16,710 --> 01:16:18,210
Don't do that!

1142
01:16:18,461 --> 01:16:22,715
That slow, creepy thing in the shadows.
Your father used to do that.

1143
01:16:22,924 --> 01:16:24,024
Mom.

1144
01:16:26,469 --> 01:16:27,886
This isn't gonna work.

1145
01:16:28,638 --> 01:16:31,140
Honey, of course it's going to work.

1146
01:16:31,349 --> 01:16:34,393
The feds caught the Citizen.
We have no one to pin it on!

1147
01:16:34,728 --> 01:16:36,145
Okay, that was bad luck.

1148
01:16:36,354 --> 01:16:40,566
But what about all these other letters
from terrorist groups threatening us?

1149
01:16:40,775 --> 01:16:42,359
"Women's Liberation Front."

1150
01:16:42,652 --> 01:16:45,988
"Islamic Jihad." They're not so nuts
about the swimsuit competition.

1151
01:16:46,239 --> 01:16:48,615
Any one of these
could have planted a bomb.

1152
01:16:48,825 --> 01:16:50,492
When did we get those?

1153
01:16:50,910 --> 01:16:53,247
I just finished writing them.

1154
01:16:53,457 --> 01:16:55,499
Just like the Citizen letter.

1155
01:16:56,585 --> 01:16:57,877
You're a genius.

1156
01:16:58,128 --> 01:17:00,629
No, Frank. I'm just pissed off.

1157
01:17:00,839 --> 01:17:03,132
Nobody fires me and gets away with it.

1158
01:17:03,383 --> 01:17:05,509
They want a newer, hotter show...

1159
01:17:05,677 --> 01:17:06,844
...they're gonna get it.

1160
01:17:07,471 --> 01:17:09,013
Mom, you're a little scary.

1161
01:17:09,264 --> 01:17:10,848
And you're a little bit sloppy.

1162
01:17:11,016 --> 01:17:13,934
Tuck your shirt.
I don't want to tell you again.

1163
01:17:15,020 --> 01:17:16,187
Let's go home, honey.

1164
01:17:16,813 --> 01:17:17,913
Mom?

1165
01:17:19,107 --> 01:17:20,357
Oops.

1166
01:17:32,537 --> 01:17:33,996
What's up?

1167
01:17:39,503 --> 01:17:41,629
- Need a hand, boss?
- I got it.

1168
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:51,013
Okay, Vic. Beautify me.

1169
01:17:51,223 --> 01:17:55,184
Hair, makeup, shellac, whatever
it is you do. That shiny stuff...

1170
01:17:55,435 --> 01:17:56,685
Where are you going?

1171
01:17:56,895 --> 01:18:01,192
Your Agent McDonald insists that I
depart, or I won't be compensated.

1172
01:18:01,568 --> 01:18:04,320
No. After the top 10!
I am completely on my own.

1173
01:18:04,530 --> 01:18:07,073
The FBI is gone, it's not fixed.
I need you!

1174
01:18:07,241 --> 01:18:09,325
Not anymore. The cocoon is open.

1175
01:18:09,535 --> 01:18:12,495
I've taken a woman
without a smidgen of estrogen...

1176
01:18:12,704 --> 01:18:14,372
...and made her a lady.

1177
01:18:14,581 --> 01:18:17,166
- Come on.
- I've never been prouder of myself.

1178
01:18:18,585 --> 01:18:19,685
Or...

1179
01:18:21,255 --> 01:18:23,589
...of any girl I have ever coached.

1180
01:18:24,716 --> 01:18:26,425
You are truly unique.

1181
01:18:27,261 --> 01:18:31,597
If I ever had a daughter,
I imagine that she would be...

1182
01:18:32,099 --> 01:18:33,266
...something like you.

1183
01:18:35,686 --> 01:18:37,270
Which is why I never reproduced.

1184
01:18:39,481 --> 01:18:42,775
I have a really strong feeling
something will happen to these girls.

1185
01:18:43,026 --> 01:18:44,694
You need to stay for me. Please.

1186
01:18:44,903 --> 01:18:46,237
I can't.

1187
01:18:46,864 --> 01:18:49,949
But I can leave you this.
I was saving it for tonight.

1188
01:18:50,284 --> 01:18:52,743
It's your size, I believe.

1189
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:54,954
Good luck to you, Gracie Lou.

1190
01:19:00,544 --> 01:19:02,253
It's been a privilege.

1191
01:19:21,275 --> 01:19:22,901
No insults today?

1192
01:19:23,152 --> 01:19:24,402
You're a Don Ho.

1193
01:19:24,612 --> 01:19:28,114
Has anyone seen Gracie? I can't
believe she missed dress rehearsal.

1194
01:19:28,324 --> 01:19:31,743
Maybe she couldn't take the pressure.
She ate four slices last night.

1195
01:19:31,952 --> 01:19:37,123
We all saw her glasses performance.
She is not making the top 10.

1196
01:19:38,167 --> 01:19:40,126
I overslept my beauty sleep.

1197
01:19:40,336 --> 01:19:43,046
- Do you need help?
- No, I'm fine.

1198
01:19:43,589 --> 01:19:45,924
I wonder which one of these...

1199
01:19:46,175 --> 01:19:47,550
...is lipstick.

1200
01:19:50,846 --> 01:19:51,946
Ladies!

1201
01:19:52,097 --> 01:19:54,599
Now, the first thing we need
to deal with...

1202
01:20:15,122 --> 01:20:17,832
Good luck, ladies! Keep it moving.
Let's go!

1203
01:20:18,042 --> 01:20:19,142
Looking good, ladies.

1204
01:20:19,377 --> 01:20:21,628
Will you go back to the mothership?

1205
01:20:21,837 --> 01:20:23,505
As long as you go with me, Tex-Ass.

1206
01:20:23,714 --> 01:20:26,841
Let's go, Pennsylvania,
New Jersey, Texas...

1207
01:20:27,551 --> 01:20:30,011
I can't open the goddamn bottle.

1208
01:20:30,221 --> 01:20:31,321
Frank!

1209
01:20:31,472 --> 01:20:33,682
Have a good show. You guys excited?

1210
01:20:34,892 --> 01:20:35,992
Get it.

1211
01:20:40,731 --> 01:20:41,856
Where are you going?

1212
01:20:42,066 --> 01:20:44,484
I forgot my breasts.
Hold on, I'll be back.

1213
01:20:50,324 --> 01:20:51,616
Going live.

1214
01:20:51,826 --> 01:20:54,911
In five, four, three...

1215
01:20:55,162 --> 01:20:58,415
It's the 75th Annual
Miss United States Pageant...

1216
01:20:58,624 --> 01:21:02,210
...live from San Antonio, Texas!

1217
01:21:13,389 --> 01:21:15,934
Good. That's the one I use at home.

1218
01:23:11,678 --> 01:23:14,513
And your host for the evening,
Stan Fields!

1219
01:23:14,722 --> 01:23:17,266
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen!

1220
01:23:17,475 --> 01:23:22,146
And welcome to a night of beauty,
talent and poise.

1221
01:23:22,355 --> 01:23:24,815
I'm not just talking
about my cohost...

1222
01:23:25,066 --> 01:23:27,570
...Kathy Morningside!

1223
01:23:30,532 --> 01:23:33,284
- Hello, Kathy.
- Stan, you charmer.

1224
01:23:33,493 --> 01:23:36,745
But you forgot to mention
"incredible intelligence."

1225
01:23:36,913 --> 01:23:39,999
That was incredibly stupid of me.
How can I make it up?

1226
01:23:40,250 --> 01:23:42,668
By helping me to announce
the top 10...

1227
01:23:42,878 --> 01:23:47,006
...chosen based on their performance
during the preliminaries this week.

1228
01:23:47,215 --> 01:23:48,716
Here's the envelope.

1229
01:23:48,925 --> 01:23:52,094
Thank you, Scott.
Ladies, hold your breath.

1230
01:23:54,890 --> 01:23:56,348
Hawaii!

1231
01:23:56,558 --> 01:23:59,810
Follow her. Beautiful.
Come in for that reaction.

1232
01:24:01,313 --> 01:24:03,189
- Go to two.
- Going to two.

1233
01:24:03,398 --> 01:24:04,940
California!

1234
01:24:07,235 --> 01:24:08,360
New York!

1235
01:24:11,823 --> 01:24:12,923
Alaska!

1236
01:24:15,785 --> 01:24:17,369
Texas!

1237
01:24:21,917 --> 01:24:23,292
Thank you.

1238
01:24:24,961 --> 01:24:26,837
New Jersey!

1239
01:24:29,257 --> 01:24:30,718
Thank you, thank you.

1240
01:24:31,553 --> 01:24:32,653
Oh, shit!

1241
01:24:34,223 --> 01:24:35,473
That was graceful.

1242
01:24:35,724 --> 01:24:37,350
That must have hurt.

1243
01:24:37,809 --> 01:24:39,894
But she's up and at it.

1244
01:24:46,068 --> 01:24:49,278
And last but not least, Rhode Island.

1245
01:24:53,992 --> 01:24:57,912
And there they are!
This year's top 10 finalists.

1246
01:25:00,999 --> 01:25:02,917
Well, the top 10 have been chosen.

1247
01:25:03,126 --> 01:25:06,796
We'll be right back with tonight's
swimsuit competition.

1248
01:25:13,679 --> 01:25:15,846
I checked out Kathy Morningside.

1249
01:25:16,014 --> 01:25:18,391
- Anything?
- Not even a traffic ticket.

1250
01:25:18,642 --> 01:25:23,187
Model citizen. Beauty contestant,
pageant director, loving mom.

1251
01:25:23,397 --> 01:25:25,690
- She's married?
- Widow. One son.

1252
01:25:25,941 --> 01:25:28,943
A sniveling, obsequious
weasel of a human being.

1253
01:25:30,028 --> 01:25:33,155
- You know her son?
- So do you. It's Frank.

1254
01:25:33,365 --> 01:25:36,033
- Her assistant?
- Asshole Frank?

1255
01:25:36,203 --> 01:25:37,303
One and the same.

1256
01:25:37,454 --> 01:25:40,456
She never mentioned anything.
Anything come up on the CCH?

1257
01:25:40,666 --> 01:25:42,041
Nothing on Frank Tobin.

1258
01:25:42,209 --> 01:25:44,419
There wouldn't be.
His name is Morningside.

1259
01:25:44,670 --> 01:25:47,463
He changed it to cover
his many indiscretions.

1260
01:25:48,215 --> 01:25:49,841
Wait. How do you know that?

1261
01:25:50,718 --> 01:25:53,219
I've been around this pageant
for many years.

1262
01:25:53,470 --> 01:25:56,723
I could shock you with the intimate
details I'm privy to.

1263
01:26:13,824 --> 01:26:15,241
Good job! Good job

1264
01:26:15,451 --> 01:26:18,328
Keep going, everybody. Keep moving.

1265
01:26:22,583 --> 01:26:23,683
Hey, hey.

1266
01:26:23,876 --> 01:26:25,335
I got you something.

1267
01:26:26,670 --> 01:26:28,254
Oh! Oh.

1268
01:26:28,505 --> 01:26:29,605
I couldn't...

1269
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:32,425
You ate pizza, you stole panties,
you're wild.

1270
01:26:32,676 --> 01:26:34,677
We worked on this, remember?

1271
01:26:35,262 --> 01:26:36,596
You're gonna be great.

1272
01:26:43,898 --> 01:26:46,399
- Can I see your ticket?
- Federal officer.

1273
01:26:47,234 --> 01:26:48,735
I'm with him.

1274
01:27:20,893 --> 01:27:22,602
Gentlemen, you can't go in...

1275
01:27:22,770 --> 01:27:23,870
Victor!

1276
01:27:24,814 --> 01:27:26,147
He's with me.

1277
01:27:27,650 --> 01:27:29,818
Wait. I'm not "with him" with him.

1278
01:27:30,069 --> 01:27:31,653
Come on, muffin.

1279
01:27:45,751 --> 01:27:49,172
Thank you! She certainly lit my fire.

1280
01:27:50,925 --> 01:27:53,301
Now you can wear Satan's panties!

1281
01:27:55,430 --> 01:27:58,098
Oh, my God, I gotta go on!

1282
01:28:02,812 --> 01:28:04,813
- Hey, Hart.
- What are you doing here?

1283
01:28:05,064 --> 01:28:08,692
I think you might have been right.
Frank is Kathy Morningside's son.

1284
01:28:08,860 --> 01:28:10,444
Disgusting, perverted Frank?

1285
01:28:10,695 --> 01:28:12,946
He cleared under another name.
I ran a new CCH.

1286
01:28:13,156 --> 01:28:15,699
DUI, assault, even a weapons charge.

1287
01:28:15,950 --> 01:28:17,284
Are we doing full deployment?

1288
01:28:17,493 --> 01:28:20,162
McDonald didn't want to hear about it.
It's just us.

1289
01:28:20,997 --> 01:28:23,206
Interview set change, five minutes.

1290
01:28:23,374 --> 01:28:25,208
Good show, Mr. Tobin.

1291
01:28:26,169 --> 01:28:29,671
Get ready.
Interview set change, five minutes.

1292
01:28:33,009 --> 01:28:35,135
You're up next, New Jersey.

1293
01:28:35,344 --> 01:28:36,887
I gotta get my glasses.

1294
01:28:38,556 --> 01:28:40,807
Hey! You're drinking my talent!

1295
01:28:41,017 --> 01:28:43,143
You got to make it into the top five.

1296
01:28:43,352 --> 01:28:45,061
- Can you whistle?
- No!

1297
01:28:45,229 --> 01:28:47,189
- Make hand puppets?
- No!

1298
01:28:47,398 --> 01:28:49,399
I had a girl who rearranged furniture.

1299
01:28:49,650 --> 01:28:52,110
You said all I have
is sarcasm and a gun.

1300
01:28:52,361 --> 01:28:54,031
That and a right hook.

1301
01:28:54,908 --> 01:28:59,828
And now, the musical stylings
of Gracie Lou Freebush.

1302
01:29:04,250 --> 01:29:05,350
Good evening.

1303
01:29:05,502 --> 01:29:09,379
The program says I'm supposed to play
the water glasses for you...

1304
01:29:09,589 --> 01:29:11,089
...but the girls got dehydrated.

1305
01:29:12,759 --> 01:29:13,884
No water glasses?

1306
01:29:14,761 --> 01:29:16,720
You want me to go to a commercial?

1307
01:29:16,930 --> 01:29:19,264
No, stay on her. Go with it.

1308
01:29:19,516 --> 01:29:23,894
I believe no woman should be without
a basic knowledge of self-defense.

1309
01:29:24,103 --> 01:29:28,190
So in order to show you this,
I'm gonna need a little help.

1310
01:29:28,691 --> 01:29:32,528
I would like to bring out
my assistant, Eric Bob.

1311
01:29:36,741 --> 01:29:39,618
More changes?
Follow her. Stay on her.

1312
01:29:39,786 --> 01:29:42,663
- How to inflict damage
with the least amount of force.

1313
01:29:43,248 --> 01:29:48,627
In some cases, your attacker might
come at you in a frontal assault.

1314
01:29:54,968 --> 01:29:56,969
Use the heel of your hand and thrust.

1315
01:29:57,178 --> 01:30:00,683
This will cause the nose to break
and your assailant's eyes to tear...

1316
01:30:00,892 --> 01:30:02,476
...giving you a chance to get away.

1317
01:30:02,727 --> 01:30:06,730
All right. Let's say your assailant
comes at you from behind.

1318
01:30:12,195 --> 01:30:13,821
Attack me!

1319
01:30:14,489 --> 01:30:15,589
Oh.

1320
01:30:15,740 --> 01:30:18,409
Little Eric looks a little scared.

1321
01:30:21,621 --> 01:30:24,081
Maybe he needs a little applause.

1322
01:30:24,958 --> 01:30:26,625
Yeah! Eric!

1323
01:30:40,515 --> 01:30:42,308
She's kicking his ass!

1324
01:30:44,603 --> 01:30:46,228
You were the best queen ever.

1325
01:30:46,438 --> 01:30:48,522
Thank you, that is so sweet.

1326
01:30:48,773 --> 01:30:51,358
Ladies, give Lori
some room to breathe.

1327
01:30:51,610 --> 01:30:53,027
Go on, now.

1328
01:30:53,361 --> 01:30:54,945
You need some powder.

1329
01:30:55,155 --> 01:30:57,114
You don't have to hold
the crown all night.

1330
01:30:57,324 --> 01:30:59,783
My God, that is disgraceful.

1331
01:30:59,951 --> 01:31:01,051
Frank!

1332
01:31:01,244 --> 01:31:04,540
Take this to the prop master.
See if you can't get it to shine.

1333
01:31:04,833 --> 01:31:08,753
If all else fails, go for the four
sensitive areas of the body.

1334
01:31:08,962 --> 01:31:10,630
But just remember to "sing."

1335
01:31:10,839 --> 01:31:12,757
S-l-N-G.

1336
01:31:16,762 --> 01:31:18,679
Solar plexus, instep...

1337
01:31:18,889 --> 01:31:20,973
...nose, groin!

1338
01:31:22,225 --> 01:31:23,392
SING.

1339
01:31:30,817 --> 01:31:32,234
Cue Stan.

1340
01:31:33,570 --> 01:31:34,695
Whoa.

1341
01:31:35,405 --> 01:31:37,281
Welcome to the Garden State!

1342
01:31:37,491 --> 01:31:42,536
When we return, we'll find out
who those lucky final five are.

1343
01:31:44,998 --> 01:31:46,540
Let's go find Frank.

1344
01:31:46,750 --> 01:31:48,417
Take left. I'll take this side.

1345
01:31:48,669 --> 01:31:50,294
No, evening gown. Now.

1346
01:31:59,096 --> 01:32:01,430
Ladies! In one moment,
five of you...

1347
01:32:01,598 --> 01:32:03,933
...will be one step
closer to the crown.

1348
01:32:05,519 --> 01:32:07,937
And one of those five...

1349
01:32:08,355 --> 01:32:09,691
...is...

1350
01:32:12,194 --> 01:32:13,319
...California!

1351
01:32:16,115 --> 01:32:17,907
Leslie Williams is a music major.

1352
01:32:18,117 --> 01:32:21,911
She believes in the healing power
of music. Loves opera, reggae...

1353
01:32:22,204 --> 01:32:25,832
...and, like any true California girl,
the Beach Boys.

1354
01:32:27,251 --> 01:32:28,710
Rhode Island!

1355
01:32:29,795 --> 01:32:32,797
Cheryl Frasier is a science major.
Her field is...

1356
01:32:32,965 --> 01:32:37,135
...nuclear fission with a minor
in elementary particles.

1357
01:32:39,096 --> 01:32:40,388
Nebraska!

1358
01:32:41,473 --> 01:32:45,101
For Kelly Beth Kelly,
all the world is a stage.

1359
01:32:45,436 --> 01:32:47,311
A theater major...

1360
01:32:47,479 --> 01:32:51,482
...she helps run a drama program
for underprivileged children.

1361
01:32:52,151 --> 01:32:53,568
New Jersey!

1362
01:32:54,653 --> 01:32:58,448
Gracie Lou Freebush hopes
to become a pediatrician.

1363
01:32:58,657 --> 01:33:00,950
Gracie, it's you. Go!

1364
01:33:01,160 --> 01:33:05,496
Her hobbies include
figure skating, water ballet...

1365
01:33:05,748 --> 01:33:08,666
...and taking long,
luxurious bubble baths.

1366
01:33:10,794 --> 01:33:12,503
You go, Gracie Lou.

1367
01:33:13,130 --> 01:33:15,675
And our fifth finalist:

1368
01:33:15,885 --> 01:33:17,844
Texas!

1369
01:33:18,512 --> 01:33:21,181
Mary Jo Wright is a psychology major.

1370
01:33:21,432 --> 01:33:24,684
In her spare time,
she works in a homeless shelter...

1371
01:33:24,935 --> 01:33:26,478
...and eats Mexican food.

1372
01:33:28,189 --> 01:33:31,900
Thank you, ladies.
You were magnificent.

1373
01:33:37,114 --> 01:33:39,199
I want all the lesbians to know...

1374
01:33:39,408 --> 01:33:41,701
...if I can make it to the top 10,
so can you!

1375
01:33:41,911 --> 01:33:43,661
Big out to Brooklyn! Yo!

1376
01:33:44,455 --> 01:33:45,705
Get her off of there!

1377
01:33:45,956 --> 01:33:47,207
Go to Stan!

1378
01:33:48,209 --> 01:33:49,959
Tina, I love you, baby!

1379
01:33:50,169 --> 01:33:52,504
I love you, Karen!

1380
01:33:55,841 --> 01:33:57,300
Whoo! Yeah!

1381
01:33:57,551 --> 01:34:02,180
And we'll be right back with our
final five lesbians. Interviews.

1382
01:34:02,389 --> 01:34:05,517
Bumper. Commercial.
Can we say "lesbians"?

1383
01:34:05,726 --> 01:34:07,310
You got a problem with that?

1384
01:34:08,229 --> 01:34:12,065
In a way, America is like a big ship.

1385
01:34:12,358 --> 01:34:15,568
When we work together
and respect each other...

1386
01:34:15,820 --> 01:34:18,404
...that's when the ship
gets safely home.

1387
01:34:19,448 --> 01:34:21,076
Terrific answer.

1388
01:34:21,327 --> 01:34:22,427
Damn it.

1389
01:34:25,248 --> 01:34:26,581
New Jersey.

1390
01:34:26,916 --> 01:34:29,876
As you may know,
there are many who consider...

1391
01:34:30,086 --> 01:34:35,257
...the Miss United States pageant
to be outdated and antifeminist.

1392
01:34:35,591 --> 01:34:37,259
What would you say to them?

1393
01:34:37,593 --> 01:34:38,927
Oh, my God.

1394
01:34:39,095 --> 01:34:42,264
I would have to say,
I used to be one of them.

1395
01:34:44,475 --> 01:34:46,768
And then I came here...

1396
01:34:47,019 --> 01:34:48,603
...and I realized that...

1397
01:34:48,771 --> 01:34:53,358
...these women are smart,
terrific people...

1398
01:34:53,568 --> 01:34:58,113
...who are just trying to make
a difference in the world.

1399
01:34:59,365 --> 01:35:01,867
We've become really good friends.

1400
01:35:02,785 --> 01:35:07,205
I know we all secretly hope the other
one will trip and fall on her face...

1401
01:35:08,124 --> 01:35:10,876
Wait a minute!
I've already done that!

1402
01:35:15,798 --> 01:35:20,010
For me, this experience has been
one of the most rewarding...

1403
01:35:21,429 --> 01:35:24,139
...and liberating experiences
of my life.

1404
01:35:27,061 --> 01:35:28,729
My God.

1405
01:35:29,397 --> 01:35:30,606
I did it.

1406
01:35:33,818 --> 01:35:35,068
And if anyone...

1407
01:35:35,570 --> 01:35:36,820
...anyone...

1408
01:35:37,322 --> 01:35:39,531
...tries to hurt one
of my new friends...

1409
01:35:40,074 --> 01:35:41,575
...I would take them out.

1410
01:35:42,243 --> 01:35:45,662
I would make them suffer so much,
they'd wish they were never born.

1411
01:35:45,830 --> 01:35:49,833
And if they ran,
I would hunt them down.

1412
01:35:54,547 --> 01:35:55,672
Thank you, Kathy.

1413
01:36:00,803 --> 01:36:04,765
A brief, shining moment,
and then that mouth.

1414
01:36:06,267 --> 01:36:08,518
Helps if you pull it out.

1415
01:36:09,854 --> 01:36:11,855
Good luck, ladies.

1416
01:36:12,065 --> 01:36:14,274
Where's the crown?
I wanted to rub it for luck.

1417
01:36:14,525 --> 01:36:16,151
Frank took it to get it polished.

1418
01:36:16,361 --> 01:36:19,154
I'll have it by the time
they announce the winner.

1419
01:36:20,365 --> 01:36:21,865
My God! It's the crown!

1420
01:36:22,116 --> 01:36:24,159
Yes, it is. You can taste it now...

1421
01:36:24,369 --> 01:36:25,577
No, no, no!

1422
01:36:25,787 --> 01:36:29,998
It goes Texas, Rhode Island
and New Jersey. Let's go.

1423
01:36:30,291 --> 01:36:32,336
Not the...
This. In the...

1424
01:36:32,545 --> 01:36:34,171
Finale positions.

1425
01:36:34,381 --> 01:36:39,385
Yes. Wear the crown. Be the crown.
You are the crown.

1426
01:36:44,557 --> 01:36:49,895
And now, the moment
of truth and beauty.

1427
01:36:50,981 --> 01:36:52,398
The envelope, please.

1428
01:37:05,829 --> 01:37:06,929
What?

1429
01:37:07,998 --> 01:37:09,915
A lot of tension.

1430
01:37:10,250 --> 01:37:12,001
The fourth runner-up is...

1431
01:37:12,752 --> 01:37:13,852
...California!

1432
01:37:22,595 --> 01:37:24,346
The third runner-up is...

1433
01:37:26,766 --> 01:37:28,100
...Nebraska!

1434
01:37:36,234 --> 01:37:38,946
- Am I in danger here?
- Wait here.

1435
01:37:39,156 --> 01:37:41,449
The second runner-up is Texas!

1436
01:37:56,423 --> 01:37:57,715
Drop it!

1437
01:37:58,050 --> 01:37:59,592
I mean it! Drop it!

1438
01:37:59,801 --> 01:38:00,901
This is it.

1439
01:38:01,094 --> 01:38:02,194
The moment.

1440
01:38:02,304 --> 01:38:06,307
One of these two ladies
will wear the crown.

1441
01:38:07,434 --> 01:38:09,310
Listen to me!

1442
01:38:09,478 --> 01:38:11,645
I'm gonna reach for my badge, slow.

1443
01:38:11,813 --> 01:38:13,689
You do, and you're dead.

1444
01:38:16,151 --> 01:38:17,485
The first runner-up...

1445
01:38:17,736 --> 01:38:20,988
...who will have to take the winner's
place if, for any reason...

1446
01:38:21,198 --> 01:38:23,199
...she cannot fulfill her duties is:

1447
01:38:25,160 --> 01:38:26,952
New Jersey! Which means...

1448
01:38:27,162 --> 01:38:28,573
...our new Miss United States is:

1449
01:38:28,705 --> 01:38:29,805
Don't take the crown.

1450
01:38:29,998 --> 01:38:31,665
Rhode Island's Cheryl Frasier!

1451
01:38:31,833 --> 01:38:35,961
- Don't take the crown. Trust me.
- I can't hear you. What?

1452
01:38:39,216 --> 01:38:41,967
She reigns over all she sees

1453
01:38:42,846 --> 01:38:44,847
She's beauty and she's grace

1454
01:38:45,015 --> 01:38:49,727
She's queen of 50 states
She's elegance and taste

1455
01:38:50,354 --> 01:38:52,647
She's Miss United States

1456
01:38:53,649 --> 01:38:56,734
Hold your crown up high

1457
01:38:58,779 --> 01:39:02,281
Go ahead, hold your crown up high

1458
01:39:04,827 --> 01:39:06,494
Raise it to the sky

1459
01:39:08,372 --> 01:39:09,831
Jersey's gone berserk!

1460
01:39:10,249 --> 01:39:11,833
Get her off the stage!

1461
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:13,709
Get away! Get away!

1462
01:39:14,545 --> 01:39:16,963
Hold your crown up high

1463
01:39:18,507 --> 01:39:21,551
Raise it to the sky

1464
01:39:22,553 --> 01:39:26,514
Hold your crown up high

1465
01:39:33,355 --> 01:39:34,638
She stands for all that's good

1466
01:39:35,357 --> 01:39:38,067
She loves her neighborhood

1467
01:39:40,154 --> 01:39:43,156
She's friends with everyone she meets

1468
01:39:45,242 --> 01:39:47,326
She's beauty and she's grace

1469
01:39:47,578 --> 01:39:49,706
She's queen of 50 states

1470
01:39:50,708 --> 01:39:54,377
She's elegance and taste

1471
01:39:54,545 --> 01:39:57,422
She's Miss United States

1472
01:39:57,590 --> 01:39:59,716
Hold your crown up high

1473
01:39:59,884 --> 01:40:00,984
Gracie!

1474
01:40:01,218 --> 01:40:05,722
Hold your crown up high

1475
01:40:25,075 --> 01:40:28,119
She's Miss United States.

1476
01:40:30,456 --> 01:40:31,915
Okay.

1477
01:40:33,334 --> 01:40:35,126
Good show, everybody.

1478
01:40:36,128 --> 01:40:39,923
- I was right in the middle of my song!
- There she is!

1479
01:40:42,635 --> 01:40:45,303
You got nothing on me.
This is ridiculous.

1480
01:40:45,554 --> 01:40:49,098
Where you're going, they'd love
to meet a former beauty queen.

1481
01:40:49,308 --> 01:40:51,476
When he says meet, he means M-E-A-T.

1482
01:40:53,981 --> 01:40:55,482
Miss Hart, you don't understand.

1483
01:40:55,650 --> 01:40:59,361
All I'm guilty of is trying to make
the world a more beautiful place.

1484
01:40:59,570 --> 01:41:00,820
Look at yourself.

1485
01:41:00,988 --> 01:41:04,157
When I met you, Dennis Rodman
looked better in a dress.

1486
01:41:04,408 --> 01:41:06,743
But now you're a lady! I did that.

1487
01:41:06,953 --> 01:41:11,164
Vic did that, and a team of highly
specialized federal manicurists...

1488
01:41:11,374 --> 01:41:13,875
...and people who make you beautiful.

1489
01:41:14,085 --> 01:41:15,460
Get in the car.

1490
01:41:15,670 --> 01:41:17,587
You think you saved something.

1491
01:41:17,797 --> 01:41:22,133
All you did was to destroy the dream
of young women all over the country.

1492
01:41:22,343 --> 01:41:23,969
Their dream is to get blown up?

1493
01:41:24,178 --> 01:41:26,179
You got a good shot
at that insanity plea.

1494
01:41:26,681 --> 01:41:27,806
I earned it!

1495
01:41:28,015 --> 01:41:30,642
Years of bitching beauty
queens and what do I get?

1496
01:41:30,851 --> 01:41:34,771
Fired! They steal my life,
they steal my beauty pageant.

1497
01:41:34,981 --> 01:41:39,192
Hey! It is not a beauty pageant.
It is a scholarship program.

1498
01:41:39,402 --> 01:41:40,902
Yeah, yeah.

1499
01:41:41,028 --> 01:41:42,128
"Yes."

1500
01:41:47,535 --> 01:41:52,330
Enjoy running the Miss San Antonio
Women's Correctional Facility Pageant!

1501
01:41:56,460 --> 01:41:58,920
- Get it? The Women's Correctional...
- Hey.

1502
01:42:00,216 --> 01:42:01,717
That was good work.

1503
01:42:04,220 --> 01:42:05,429
Right back at you.

1504
01:42:08,558 --> 01:42:10,934
So, how does it feel?

1505
01:42:11,644 --> 01:42:13,520
Throwing the rule book
out of the window?

1506
01:42:13,730 --> 01:42:15,480
Pretty good, actually.

1507
01:42:16,441 --> 01:42:18,066
I was thinking...

1508
01:42:18,234 --> 01:42:19,651
...when we get back...

1509
01:42:19,861 --> 01:42:23,238
...after we write up our reports
and you get all ugly again...

1510
01:42:23,656 --> 01:42:25,741
...maybe we could have dinner?

1511
01:42:25,950 --> 01:42:28,410
What? You asking me out on a date?

1512
01:42:29,078 --> 01:42:30,746
No. Just a casual dinner.

1513
01:42:30,997 --> 01:42:33,915
If we happen to have sex afterwards,
so be it.

1514
01:42:37,503 --> 01:42:40,422
You think I'm gorgeous.

1515
01:42:40,590 --> 01:42:43,467
You want to date me...

1516
01:42:43,676 --> 01:42:46,511
...love me and marry me.

1517
01:42:57,982 --> 01:42:59,900
A part of you is gonna miss this.

1518
01:43:00,109 --> 01:43:02,277
The heels.
They do something for my posture.

1519
01:43:02,528 --> 01:43:04,696
I'm suddenly very aware
and proud of my breasts.

1520
01:43:04,908 --> 01:43:07,284
- Funny, me too.
- Agent Matthews! Gracie!

1521
01:43:07,535 --> 01:43:08,869
Thank God you're still here.

1522
01:43:09,079 --> 01:43:10,621
There's been an emergency.

1523
01:43:10,872 --> 01:43:14,291
Somebody found some
sort of incendiary device.

1524
01:43:14,501 --> 01:43:16,293
Come on, quickly!

1525
01:43:16,878 --> 01:43:17,978
Excuse me. FBI.

1526
01:43:18,088 --> 01:43:22,132
She saved the pageant,
she saved our lives, and here she is!

1527
01:43:25,512 --> 01:43:26,804
That's not gonna work for me.

1528
01:43:27,889 --> 01:43:29,139
I can't go up there!

1529
01:43:29,432 --> 01:43:30,766
It was his idea, Gracie Lou.

1530
01:43:30,975 --> 01:43:33,811
I'd never get you here unless
you could shoot someone.

1531
01:43:34,062 --> 01:43:35,813
You'll get yours, Henry Higgins.

1532
01:43:36,523 --> 01:43:37,623
Come on.

1533
01:43:37,774 --> 01:43:39,149
Come on!

1534
01:43:42,028 --> 01:43:47,116
Ladies and gentlemen,
agent Gracie Hart of the FBI!

1535
01:43:50,537 --> 01:43:51,829
Not so fast!

1536
01:43:52,080 --> 01:43:55,165
Because even though
you're a federal officer...

1537
01:43:55,458 --> 01:43:59,169
...to us, you will always be
Gracie Lou Freebush.

1538
01:43:59,337 --> 01:44:04,174
The nicest, sweetest,
coolest girl at the pageant...

1539
01:44:04,426 --> 01:44:07,177
...and this year's Miss Congeniality!

1540
01:44:24,197 --> 01:44:25,364
I, uh...

1541
01:44:25,782 --> 01:44:27,825
I don't know what to say.

1542
01:44:28,994 --> 01:44:30,953
Except for...

1543
01:44:31,371 --> 01:44:33,122
...I can't wear this at work.

1544
01:44:35,542 --> 01:44:38,377
I never thought anything like
this would happen to me.

1545
01:44:38,879 --> 01:44:42,590
I kind of hoped it wouldn't.
But now that it has...

1546
01:44:43,049 --> 01:44:44,592
...I just want to say that...

1547
01:44:44,801 --> 01:44:46,218
...I'm very...

1548
01:44:49,389 --> 01:44:50,489
...very honored.

1549
01:44:51,975 --> 01:44:53,075
And...

1550
01:44:54,227 --> 01:44:55,327
...moved.

1551
01:44:55,896 --> 01:44:57,104
And...

1552
01:44:59,733 --> 01:45:01,400
...truly touched.

1553
01:45:05,197 --> 01:45:06,363
And...

1554
01:45:13,622 --> 01:45:15,498
...I really do want world peace.

1555
01:45:16,305 --> 01:46:16,345
