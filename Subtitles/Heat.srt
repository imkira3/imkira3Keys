1
00:03:38,275 --> 00:03:39,818
Check, charge or cash?

2
00:03:40,027 --> 00:03:41,069
Cash.

3
00:03:43,363 --> 00:03:44,865
Make it out to...

4
00:03:45,073 --> 00:03:46,909
Jack's Demolition. Tucson.

5
00:03:47,367 --> 00:03:48,911
$788.30.

6
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,272
Taking me to breakfast?

7
00:05:41,647 --> 00:05:43,274
I can't. I'm meeting Bosko.

8
00:05:44,734 --> 00:05:45,985
Hey, Vincent.

9
00:05:46,277 --> 00:05:47,653
Where are my barrettes?

10
00:05:47,987 --> 00:05:49,947
I saw them on the kitchen table.

11
00:05:50,239 --> 00:05:51,532
I already checked.

12
00:05:52,033 --> 00:05:53,117
Coffee?

13
00:05:53,326 --> 00:05:54,368
No school today?

14
00:05:54,493 --> 00:05:57,663
My dad's taking me to the new building
and then to lunch.

15
00:05:57,872 --> 00:05:59,457
Try under the sofa cushions.

16
00:06:03,335 --> 00:06:05,379
He's already half an hour late.

17
00:06:06,005 --> 00:06:09,133
He's going to show,
or stand her up like last time?

18
00:06:09,508 --> 00:06:10,676
I'll make coffee.

19
00:06:10,968 --> 00:06:12,094
Out of time.

20
00:06:24,857 --> 00:06:27,401
Mom, my barrettes are not on the couch.

21
00:06:28,485 --> 00:06:30,154
Wear the blue ones.

22
00:06:30,571 --> 00:06:33,240
I don't want to wear the blue ones.
They don't match.

23
00:06:33,365 --> 00:06:36,160
- Did you check in your bathroom?
- I checked everywhere!

24
00:06:36,285 --> 00:06:37,661
What do you want me to do?

25
00:06:37,786 --> 00:06:38,912
Find them!

26
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:41,957
- Mom, pay attention!
- All right, sweetie, all right!

27
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:43,876
Daddy's going to be here.

28
00:06:44,001 --> 00:06:45,169
I won't be ready!

29
00:06:45,294 --> 00:06:46,879
- I can't be late.
- You won't.

30
00:06:47,004 --> 00:06:48,630
I will be late!

31
00:06:48,964 --> 00:06:51,800
Before Daddy comes,
we can find them if we look together.

32
00:06:51,925 --> 00:06:54,511
It's all right, baby. It's all right.

33
00:06:55,846 --> 00:06:58,724
We'll find them together, you and me.
We'll find them.

34
00:06:58,849 --> 00:07:02,686
Just relax. He won't come
before we find them. I promise you.

35
00:07:14,197 --> 00:07:15,782
Give me another refill.

36
00:07:27,627 --> 00:07:28,795
What's your name?

37
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,130
Waingro.

38
00:07:38,972 --> 00:07:40,265
You're Michael?

39
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:55,530
You guys always work together?

40
00:07:56,239 --> 00:07:57,657
All the time.

41
00:07:58,032 --> 00:07:59,367
Real tight crew?

42
00:07:59,576 --> 00:08:00,660
Real tight.

43
00:08:01,744 --> 00:08:05,206
If this works good,
I'd consider going again, you know.

44
00:08:05,623 --> 00:08:08,001
Yeah. Stop talking, okay, Slick?

45
00:08:18,678 --> 00:08:19,929
How's he doing?

46
00:08:20,096 --> 00:08:21,431
Hundred percent.

47
00:08:22,348 --> 00:08:23,808
Right on schedule.

48
00:08:24,434 --> 00:08:26,310
Made a right on Venice Boulevard.

49
00:08:28,187 --> 00:08:29,981
<i>We're a mile and a half from you.</i>

50
00:08:30,106 --> 00:08:31,190
Okay.

51
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:56,882
Just crossed over the No. 1 lane,
300 yards from you.

52
00:08:57,633 --> 00:08:58,634
Get set.

53
00:08:58,801 --> 00:08:59,844
I am.

54
00:09:09,562 --> 00:09:10,604
Here we go.

55
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:12,040
211!

56
00:10:12,374 --> 00:10:13,834
We're being held up!

57
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:23,176
<i>- 211 alarm. Armored car.
- There's the call.</i>

58
00:10:23,301 --> 00:10:24,344
<i>Three minutes.</i>

59
00:10:25,971 --> 00:10:26,972
Clear!

60
00:11:31,119 --> 00:11:32,870
Eighty seconds left!

61
00:11:34,288 --> 00:11:36,416
Get back! Get back!

62
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:38,418
Get back!

63
00:11:40,586 --> 00:11:44,632
Slick, see that shit coming out of
their ears? They can't fucking hear you!

64
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:45,883
Cool it!

65
00:11:58,145 --> 00:11:59,272
I got it.

66
00:11:59,814 --> 00:12:00,940
Got it.

67
00:12:04,068 --> 00:12:05,987
You had to fuck with me.

68
00:12:06,404 --> 00:12:08,114
Want to fuck with me?

69
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:35,224
What are you doing? What did he do?

70
00:12:35,349 --> 00:12:36,809
He was making a move.

71
00:12:46,402 --> 00:12:47,736
Dumb motherfucker.

72
00:13:18,809 --> 00:13:19,935
I heard them.

73
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:44,626
$1.6 million...

74
00:13:45,585 --> 00:13:48,213
Forty cents on the dollar, $640,000 to you.

75
00:13:48,421 --> 00:13:50,340
Here's $150,000 front money.

76
00:13:51,258 --> 00:13:53,343
Get you the rest in two, three days.

77
00:13:54,552 --> 00:13:56,054
Who owned these?

78
00:14:00,058 --> 00:14:02,018
"Malibu Equity and Investments."

79
00:14:02,769 --> 00:14:04,145
Roger Van Zant.

80
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:06,064
Owns banks in the Caymans...

81
00:14:06,189 --> 00:14:10,068
runs investment portfolios
for offshore drug money. Stuff like that.

82
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,402
So?

83
00:14:11,611 --> 00:14:13,488
You ripped off his bearer bonds.

84
00:14:13,613 --> 00:14:14,781
He's insured.

85
00:14:15,865 --> 00:14:18,827
That's the point. He collects
100% from the insurance.

86
00:14:18,952 --> 00:14:21,579
He's a player. Maybe he buys
his bonds back from us...

87
00:14:21,704 --> 00:14:25,750
for 60% of their value.
Makes 40% on top of the 100%.

88
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:30,838
Sell it back to him,
that's an extra $320,000 to you.

89
00:14:31,714 --> 00:14:32,757
Try it on.

90
00:14:33,758 --> 00:14:34,842
Kelso called.

91
00:14:34,968 --> 00:14:36,052
About what?

92
00:14:36,302 --> 00:14:39,097
A score he's putting out,
he wants you to look at.

93
00:14:39,555 --> 00:14:41,599
I don't need his score. I got my own.

94
00:14:41,808 --> 00:14:44,102
Says it's clean and low eight figures.

95
00:14:44,644 --> 00:14:45,853
9:00 a.m. tomorrow.

96
00:14:45,978 --> 00:14:47,271
What happened?

97
00:14:48,731 --> 00:14:49,941
Don't ask.

98
00:15:25,351 --> 00:15:26,393
Find the ambulance?

99
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:29,688
- Dumped it four blocks from here.
- 22nd Street.

100
00:15:30,648 --> 00:15:33,651
They torched it.
Burned the guns, clothes, everything.

101
00:15:36,195 --> 00:15:40,324
They were airborne. They taped the last
few seconds of the black-and-whites.

102
00:15:42,785 --> 00:15:44,995
Stolen from Fresno two weeks ago.

103
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,123
Yellow pickup truck out of Whittier
a day before yesterday.

104
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,833
You taking this one?

105
00:15:50,376 --> 00:15:52,252
Or does it stay in Division?

106
00:15:53,462 --> 00:15:56,924
Does this look like gangbangers
working the local 7-11 to you?

107
00:15:57,049 --> 00:15:58,926
Robbery-Homicide's taking it.

108
00:15:59,718 --> 00:16:01,053
We got three motorists.

109
00:16:01,178 --> 00:16:03,597
All they saw were men with masks.
They were distant.

110
00:16:03,722 --> 00:16:06,266
TV man over there, however,
he was closer.

111
00:16:07,893 --> 00:16:09,269
Did he ID anybody?

112
00:16:09,394 --> 00:16:11,855
He was hiding. He heard it mostly.

113
00:16:14,233 --> 00:16:15,817
What about them?

114
00:16:16,568 --> 00:16:19,821
According to the TV man,
this guy started mouthing off.

115
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,073
Smart.

116
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:23,283
Somebody called a guard "Slick."

117
00:16:24,868 --> 00:16:26,203
Now, I figure this guy...

118
00:16:26,328 --> 00:16:29,373
went for that hold-out piece, ankle holster.

119
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,291
From here...

120
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:32,834
bang, bang...

121
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:34,419
bang, bang, bang.

122
00:16:34,836 --> 00:16:35,879
This side.

123
00:16:36,171 --> 00:16:40,759
This guy has got what appears to be
a double tap-entry wound to the sternum.

124
00:16:41,259 --> 00:16:44,262
Tattooing around the head wound,
scorched bone, close range.

125
00:16:44,387 --> 00:16:45,555
Probably executed.

126
00:16:47,724 --> 00:16:50,268
It was $1.6 million in bearer bonds.

127
00:16:50,435 --> 00:16:52,145
They ignored the loose cash.

128
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:55,065
'Cause they had no time.
They were on a clock.

129
00:16:55,273 --> 00:16:57,984
Which means they knew
our response time to a 211...

130
00:16:58,109 --> 00:17:00,987
had our air, immobilized it, entered...

131
00:17:01,613 --> 00:17:03,740
escaped in under three minutes.

132
00:17:03,948 --> 00:17:06,701
It's a good spot here.
We got good escape routes.

133
00:17:06,868 --> 00:17:08,078
Two freeways...

134
00:17:08,286 --> 00:17:09,746
within a quarter of a mile.

135
00:17:09,871 --> 00:17:11,081
Traffic video camera?

136
00:17:11,539 --> 00:17:13,541
Probably disabled. Check it anyway.

137
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,168
You recognize the M. O?

138
00:17:15,293 --> 00:17:16,461
M. O...

139
00:17:16,711 --> 00:17:18,088
is that they're good.

140
00:17:18,463 --> 00:17:22,675
Once it escalated into a murder-one
beef for all, after they killed two guards...

141
00:17:22,801 --> 00:17:24,135
they didn't hesitate.

142
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:28,181
Popped guard No. 3 because...
what difference does it make?

143
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,266
Why leave a living witness?

144
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:33,436
Drop of a hat,
these guys will rock-and-roll.

145
00:17:36,481 --> 00:17:38,107
The shape charge.

146
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:42,153
The shape charge indicates
that they are technically proficient.

147
00:17:42,278 --> 00:17:44,447
Proficient enough to go in on the prowl.

148
00:17:44,572 --> 00:17:47,909
Let's look for recent high-line burglaries
that have mystified us.

149
00:17:48,493 --> 00:17:51,662
Run "Slick" as an alias to the FBI.
You'll get the phone book.

150
00:17:51,788 --> 00:17:54,624
Do it anyway.
Who's moving the bearer bonds?

151
00:17:56,042 --> 00:17:59,587
Check the usual fences. You and I will
check Cuzomano and Torena.

152
00:17:59,712 --> 00:18:02,089
I want you to take Goldstein and Alfaro.

153
00:18:02,298 --> 00:18:03,674
Hang in with Forensics.

154
00:18:03,883 --> 00:18:06,510
From the bomb squad,
I want the explosive.

155
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:09,513
If we're lucky, it's exotic.
We can trace the sale.

156
00:18:11,182 --> 00:18:13,809
Get your hand out of that man's pocket.

157
00:18:21,942 --> 00:18:23,444
Anyone want some pie?

158
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,663
Gotta go to the john.

159
00:19:05,486 --> 00:19:09,323
I had to get it on. He was making a move.
I had to get it on.

160
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:26,048
Split's in the car.
I took out of ours evenly...

161
00:19:27,382 --> 00:19:29,426
to make up for his full end...

162
00:19:30,177 --> 00:19:34,222
'cause I want to pay off and get rid
of this motherfucker right now.

163
00:20:13,136 --> 00:20:14,179
Hold it!

164
00:21:54,236 --> 00:21:55,446
Where's the rest?

165
00:21:55,571 --> 00:21:58,365
We're late. You look too good to go out.

166
00:21:58,741 --> 00:22:00,617
I'll just jump you right here.

167
00:22:04,163 --> 00:22:06,790
- Where is it?
- Squared the bookies, baby.

168
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:10,127
There's more in a couple of days,
so don't sweat it. We're late.

169
00:22:10,252 --> 00:22:11,295
Come on.

170
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:13,088
You gotta be kidding me.

171
00:22:14,798 --> 00:22:15,924
Honey...

172
00:22:16,049 --> 00:22:20,762
it ain't worth the risks you take
for $8,000. Like in "Risk versus reward."

173
00:22:21,013 --> 00:22:22,055
Let's go.

174
00:22:22,181 --> 00:22:23,515
Get your coat.

175
00:22:25,517 --> 00:22:28,604
There's no point talking.
You're just a child growing older.

176
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:30,105
What does that mean?

177
00:22:30,439 --> 00:22:34,443
We're not making forward progress
like real grown-up adults living our lives...

178
00:22:34,568 --> 00:22:36,737
because I married a gambling junkie.

179
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:39,072
Get in the fucking car.

180
00:22:40,866 --> 00:22:42,534
What am I doing in here?

181
00:22:43,035 --> 00:22:44,077
You're not!

182
00:22:44,202 --> 00:22:46,872
Leave the bank book and the car keys...

183
00:22:46,997 --> 00:22:48,582
in the kitchen on your way out!

184
00:22:48,707 --> 00:22:52,544
- Are we going?
- Keep that crap. Dominick comes with me.

185
00:22:54,713 --> 00:22:56,423
Don't even think about...

186
00:23:21,114 --> 00:23:23,825
Tell me Albert Torena called back.

187
00:23:24,909 --> 00:23:26,619
Albert Torena call Vincent?

188
00:23:27,829 --> 00:23:29,038
No.

189
00:23:29,164 --> 00:23:30,582
Report came in.

190
00:23:31,249 --> 00:23:33,877
<i>The explosive was Dy-Ex,
used in demolition.</i>

191
00:23:34,127 --> 00:23:36,087
<i>You can pick it up in Nevada...</i>

192
00:23:36,254 --> 00:23:37,797
Arizona, New Mexico.

193
00:23:38,131 --> 00:23:39,883
Too common to trace a sale.

194
00:23:40,258 --> 00:23:41,843
That's wonderful.

195
00:24:02,071 --> 00:24:03,072
You all right?

196
00:24:03,698 --> 00:24:05,825
What happened? Where have you been?

197
00:24:06,451 --> 00:24:07,493
Work.

198
00:24:08,786 --> 00:24:10,538
Lauren's dad show up?

199
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:13,332
Didn't call...

200
00:24:13,457 --> 00:24:16,252
didn't show. We waited for you till 10:30.

201
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:21,507
Now, does this guy have any idea
what's going on with this kid?

202
00:24:24,051 --> 00:24:25,261
I don't know.

203
00:24:26,304 --> 00:24:27,722
Fucking jerk.

204
00:24:29,473 --> 00:24:30,683
Is she okay?

205
00:24:31,809 --> 00:24:33,853
She's been in her room all day.

206
00:24:34,061 --> 00:24:36,689
So, no, she's not okay. Neither am I.

207
00:24:37,314 --> 00:24:38,774
I made dinner...

208
00:24:39,191 --> 00:24:41,152
for us, four hours ago.

209
00:24:42,903 --> 00:24:45,906
Every time I try to maintain
a consistent mood between us...

210
00:24:46,031 --> 00:24:47,366
you withdraw.

211
00:24:48,492 --> 00:24:51,954
I got three dead bodies on a sidewalk...

212
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:54,456
off Venice Boulevard, Justine.

213
00:24:54,707 --> 00:24:56,041
I'm sorry...

214
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,210
if the goddamn...

215
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:00,212
chicken...

216
00:25:01,005 --> 00:25:02,631
got overcooked.

217
00:25:59,354 --> 00:26:00,480
Coffee, sir?

218
00:26:00,689 --> 00:26:01,690
Please.

219
00:26:07,362 --> 00:26:09,030
Will you pass the cream?

220
00:26:11,658 --> 00:26:12,742
Thanks.

221
00:26:12,867 --> 00:26:14,077
What'd you get?

222
00:26:15,328 --> 00:26:16,329
What?

223
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:18,790
What are you reading?

224
00:26:24,546 --> 00:26:25,964
Book about metals.

225
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:31,636
<i>Stress Fractures in Titanium.</i>

226
00:26:34,013 --> 00:26:35,682
What kind of work do you do?

227
00:26:38,852 --> 00:26:42,105
Lady, why are you so interested
in what I read or what I do?

228
00:26:46,526 --> 00:26:48,278
I've seen you in the store.

229
00:26:48,403 --> 00:26:49,654
What store?

230
00:26:50,071 --> 00:26:52,073
Hennessey and Ingalls. I work there.

231
00:26:54,033 --> 00:26:56,494
If you don't want to talk to me, it's okay.

232
00:26:56,703 --> 00:26:58,371
I'm sorry I bothered you.

233
00:27:08,756 --> 00:27:11,884
I didn't mean to be rude.
I didn't recognize you.

234
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,054
I work in metals. I'm a salesman.

235
00:27:15,388 --> 00:27:16,722
My name's Neil.

236
00:27:22,061 --> 00:27:23,229
I'm Eady.

237
00:27:26,107 --> 00:27:27,692
You like working there?

238
00:27:29,443 --> 00:27:30,528
Sure.

239
00:27:31,237 --> 00:27:34,907
I get a discount and there's
a whole section of books in my area.

240
00:27:35,116 --> 00:27:36,200
What area?

241
00:27:36,742 --> 00:27:38,202
Graphic design.

242
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,164
I do letterheads and logotypes
at night and...

243
00:27:42,915 --> 00:27:45,751
the store's a day job
until I get enough going.

244
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,545
Who do you do that for?

245
00:27:50,631 --> 00:27:52,049
A restaurant.

246
00:27:52,591 --> 00:27:54,552
I did their menus, and...

247
00:27:57,263 --> 00:27:59,390
a small record label.

248
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:01,600
CDs.

249
00:28:02,142 --> 00:28:03,894
I've done two so far.

250
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:07,940
You go to school for that?

251
00:28:08,482 --> 00:28:09,525
Yeah.

252
00:28:10,609 --> 00:28:11,944
I went to Parsons.

253
00:28:12,111 --> 00:28:13,278
Where's that?

254
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:14,738
New York City.

255
00:28:15,572 --> 00:28:17,157
How long you been here?

256
00:28:18,283 --> 00:28:19,618
About a year.

257
00:28:20,619 --> 00:28:21,745
Like it?

258
00:28:23,622 --> 00:28:26,417
Not really. I'm mostly here for the work.

259
00:28:34,132 --> 00:28:35,801
Live in this neighborhood?

260
00:28:35,926 --> 00:28:38,679
No, I live kind of above Sunset Plaza.

261
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,058
It's a little house I rent.

262
00:28:43,183 --> 00:28:46,770
And it's kind of rundown,
but a beautiful, beautiful view.

263
00:28:48,355 --> 00:28:49,564
What about you?

264
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:50,941
I live up here.

265
00:28:51,149 --> 00:28:52,526
That's very funny.

266
00:28:56,863 --> 00:28:59,157
Where's your family from originally?

267
00:29:01,701 --> 00:29:03,453
They're Scotch-Irish.

268
00:29:04,329 --> 00:29:06,456
They emigrated to Appalachia...

269
00:29:06,581 --> 00:29:08,625
in the late 1700s.

270
00:29:11,336 --> 00:29:12,796
Where are you from?

271
00:29:13,547 --> 00:29:14,839
The Bay area.

272
00:29:16,341 --> 00:29:17,676
Your folks there?

273
00:29:20,762 --> 00:29:23,223
My mother died a long time ago,
and my father...

274
00:29:23,348 --> 00:29:24,891
I don't know where he is.

275
00:29:25,016 --> 00:29:26,643
Got a brother somewhere.

276
00:29:32,524 --> 00:29:34,484
You have a tight family. I can tell.

277
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:36,861
Right?

278
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:38,363
You're right.

279
00:29:48,206 --> 00:29:49,833
City of lights.

280
00:29:53,253 --> 00:29:54,796
In Fiji, they have...

281
00:29:54,921 --> 00:29:58,591
iridescent algae that come out
once a year in the water.

282
00:29:59,884 --> 00:30:02,011
That's what it looks like out there.

283
00:30:03,262 --> 00:30:04,555
You been there?

284
00:30:05,932 --> 00:30:07,850
No, I'm going there someday.

285
00:30:16,943 --> 00:30:18,277
You travel a lot?

286
00:30:21,239 --> 00:30:22,281
Yeah.

287
00:30:22,657 --> 00:30:24,408
Traveling make you lonely?

288
00:30:29,622 --> 00:30:31,499
I'm alone. I am not...

289
00:30:31,958 --> 00:30:33,251
lonely.

290
00:30:33,626 --> 00:30:34,669
You?

291
00:30:36,295 --> 00:30:37,672
Real lonely.

292
00:32:42,712 --> 00:32:43,880
Albert!

293
00:32:46,674 --> 00:32:47,717
Shit!

294
00:32:49,636 --> 00:32:52,305
What you doing here? You crazy?
This ain't Disneyland.

295
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:54,557
You were supposed to get back to me.

296
00:32:54,682 --> 00:32:56,476
Where the fuck you been?

297
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,062
I couldn't break free.

298
00:32:59,187 --> 00:33:01,189
Let's violate his ass right now.

299
00:33:01,397 --> 00:33:02,899
I do for you...

300
00:33:03,191 --> 00:33:05,526
you don't do for me, is that it?

301
00:33:06,235 --> 00:33:10,657
Vincent, man. I swear, I was out all night.
I'm hitting like a Flamingo matador.

302
00:33:10,865 --> 00:33:13,159
That's got nothing to do with me.

303
00:33:13,409 --> 00:33:17,997
I'm cutting it smooth. I'm generating
leads and shit for you. I'm a dancer.

304
00:33:18,206 --> 00:33:19,499
You bullshit.

305
00:33:19,707 --> 00:33:22,126
I paged your ass all day.
I hate fucking paging.

306
00:33:22,251 --> 00:33:24,796
You're a speed freak,
jacking methamphetamine again.

307
00:33:24,921 --> 00:33:27,799
Where's your empathy?
It's a substance abuse problem.

308
00:33:27,924 --> 00:33:31,552
Empathy was yesterday. Today you're
wasting my motherfucking time.

309
00:33:31,677 --> 00:33:33,221
You fall in love?

310
00:33:34,805 --> 00:33:36,390
Did you fall in love...

311
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:38,309
and went off somewhere?

312
00:33:38,434 --> 00:33:40,645
Tell me that, I'll settle for it.

313
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:44,190
Give me all you got!

314
00:33:44,565 --> 00:33:46,233
Give me all you got!

315
00:33:46,651 --> 00:33:50,321
I swear, my brother Richard's going
to talk to you.

316
00:33:50,446 --> 00:33:52,031
I heard Richard?

317
00:33:52,782 --> 00:33:54,450
He's going to talk to you.

318
00:33:56,243 --> 00:33:57,828
He's gonna meet you tonight.

319
00:33:57,953 --> 00:33:59,455
He's not here, is he?

320
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:00,998
No, he'll meet you tonight.

321
00:34:01,123 --> 00:34:02,625
What happened to now?

322
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:06,670
I implored him because I knew
you was coming this a.m.

323
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:07,838
Bullshit.

324
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:10,090
I swear. He said no...

325
00:34:10,424 --> 00:34:12,343
'cause he in Phoenix.

326
00:34:12,509 --> 00:34:14,762
<i>By the time I get to Phoenix</i>

327
00:34:15,471 --> 00:34:17,139
<i>He'll be rising</i>

328
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:20,601
<i>He'll probably leave a note</i>

329
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:22,519
<i>Right on the door</i>

330
00:34:22,645 --> 00:34:24,772
Tonight's the best I can do for you.

331
00:34:26,482 --> 00:34:30,110
He'll meet you at BJ's on Alvarado.

332
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,362
At 2:00 a.m.

333
00:34:32,488 --> 00:34:33,530
Be there.

334
00:34:33,655 --> 00:34:35,240
You be there, too.

335
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:38,202
I can't be there, man. I got things to do.

336
00:34:38,327 --> 00:34:41,163
I got things to do, I got places to be.

337
00:34:42,498 --> 00:34:43,582
Be there.

338
00:34:49,713 --> 00:34:51,882
Don't waste my motherfucking time!

339
00:34:56,136 --> 00:34:57,262
What is it?

340
00:34:59,014 --> 00:35:00,265
It's a bank.

341
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:04,186
It depos cash on Thursday for distribution
to all the other branches...

342
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:06,355
to cover Friday payroll checks.

343
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,649
So on Thursdays,
the command branch has got a full whack.

344
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:11,276
On the prowl or strong?

345
00:35:11,401 --> 00:35:12,486
Strong. Through the door.

346
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:13,695
How many guys?

347
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:17,574
About four, or three, plus a driver.
You walk in, knock 'em over, walk out.

348
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:21,161
You want $100,000 in advance
against a ten-percent cut for that?

349
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:23,622
Sounds like a cowboy score.

350
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:27,375
They hit the hold-up alarms,
I gotta get out before the cops show.

351
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:30,503
They hit three hold-up alarm systems.

352
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:32,631
Two Telco and a cellular.

353
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:37,344
But the signals aren't
going anywhere because...

354
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:39,304
the night before...

355
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:40,847
you cut in...

356
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:43,641
and trick out the alarm system computer...

357
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,101
to turn itself...

358
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:47,312
and the video recorders off...

359
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:49,647
20 minutes before you enter.

360
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:52,150
Architectural, electrical plans?

361
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:53,401
I got that.

362
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:56,446
I got the boards already built.
They go right into the CPU.

363
00:35:57,864 --> 00:35:59,324
What's the estimate?

364
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:04,871
$12.1, $12.2 million.

365
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:09,000
You're on.

366
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,377
Congratulations.

367
00:36:12,045 --> 00:36:15,715
Let me give you a little idea
of where my estimates come from.

368
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:18,217
Nobody knew the merch was yours.

369
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:21,387
My way, you get 100%
from the insurance company...

370
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:23,431
take the bonds back from us...

371
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:27,059
<i>at 60 cents on the dollar
and make yourself another 40%.</i>

372
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:31,731
The operation doesn't skip a beat.
We all make out.

373
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,358
Sure, you got a deal.

374
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:38,487
Good, because there's no percentage
if everyone gets upset.

375
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:41,824
You have your man call me
and we'll set the meet.

376
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,284
Yeah, okay.

377
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:45,578
Nice talking to you.

378
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:48,289
You gonna deal with these guys?

379
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:51,250
Word's on the street
it's okay to steal my stuff.

380
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:53,794
I'm going to kill these sons of bitches.

381
00:36:53,919 --> 00:36:57,131
Have Harry bring me the spreadsheets
for Canary Island's Offshore.

382
00:37:02,344 --> 00:37:05,014
That's not really an estimate.
Those are exact figures.

383
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:08,350
I have a printout of the bank's cash flow
for the past two months.

384
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:10,102
How'd you get this information?

385
00:37:10,352 --> 00:37:11,604
Just comes to you.

386
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:14,148
This stuff just flies through the air.

387
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:17,860
It's just beamed out all over the place.
You just have to grab it.

388
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:19,570
I know how to grab it.

389
00:37:25,492 --> 00:37:27,119
Okay, here we go.

390
00:37:27,661 --> 00:37:29,121
$13.9 million.

391
00:37:32,791 --> 00:37:34,209
- I bought it.
- Good.

392
00:37:34,668 --> 00:37:36,128
What did I tell you?

393
00:37:39,965 --> 00:37:41,008
Here.

394
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:45,053
We're on. Call Van Zant,
collect the money.

395
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:47,431
How is he?

396
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:49,308
He's a businessman.

397
00:38:27,304 --> 00:38:28,763
Chris is at my place.

398
00:38:32,183 --> 00:38:33,351
What's wrong?

399
00:38:33,685 --> 00:38:35,520
Husband-and-wife stuff.

400
00:38:36,187 --> 00:38:37,856
I'll let him sleep it off.

401
00:38:52,245 --> 00:38:53,705
What happened to you?

402
00:38:57,917 --> 00:38:59,961
When will you get some furniture?

403
00:39:00,086 --> 00:39:01,754
When I get around to it.

404
00:39:04,424 --> 00:39:06,342
Charlene's gonna leave me.

405
00:39:08,761 --> 00:39:09,804
Why?

406
00:39:12,932 --> 00:39:15,018
Not enough steaks in the freezer.

407
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:18,104
With everything we've been doing?

408
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:21,858
Vegas and the Super Bowl cleaned me out.

409
00:39:22,775 --> 00:39:24,736
When you gonna get an old lady?

410
00:39:24,902 --> 00:39:26,529
When I get around to it.

411
00:39:28,948 --> 00:39:31,033
You got something else on the side?

412
00:39:32,618 --> 00:39:33,911
Nothing regular.

413
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:37,039
She got something else on the side?

414
00:39:37,165 --> 00:39:38,458
- No.
- You sure?

415
00:39:39,625 --> 00:39:41,085
Yeah, I'm sure.

416
00:39:43,296 --> 00:39:45,256
I don't know what you're doing.

417
00:39:46,799 --> 00:39:50,845
As Jimmy said, "You want to be
making moves on the street?

418
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:54,432
"Have no attachments.
Allow nothing to be in your life...

419
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:59,186
"that you can't walk out on in 30 seconds
if you spot the heat around the corner."

420
00:39:59,603 --> 00:40:00,771
Remember that?

421
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:10,573
For me, the sun rises
and sets with her, man.

422
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:27,006
We take the delivery of cash
from Van Zant...

423
00:40:27,131 --> 00:40:30,092
then I drop a deposit on Kelso
for this bank.

424
00:40:30,342 --> 00:40:31,677
Bank? What bank?

425
00:40:32,177 --> 00:40:34,930
What about the platinum thing?
It's ready to fall.

426
00:40:35,055 --> 00:40:36,932
That goes, too. Then the bank.

427
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:42,479
Want some breakfast?

428
00:40:49,987 --> 00:40:51,321
Are you okay?

429
00:40:51,822 --> 00:40:53,157
Yeah, sugar.

430
00:41:00,664 --> 00:41:01,832
For real.

431
00:41:01,957 --> 00:41:03,083
I'll do good.

432
00:41:03,333 --> 00:41:04,751
I'll see you later.

433
00:41:20,684 --> 00:41:22,018
You Solenko?

434
00:41:22,436 --> 00:41:23,520
I'm Don Breedan.

435
00:41:23,729 --> 00:41:27,899
Grierson, my parole officer, told me
to come here, see if you had a job for me.

436
00:41:28,024 --> 00:41:30,235
You're familiar with this kind of operation?

437
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,028
I'm a great grill man.

438
00:41:32,237 --> 00:41:33,572
Good. Good for you.

439
00:41:33,697 --> 00:41:37,742
You'll mop the toilets, hit the dishwasher,
bus tables and empty the garbage.

440
00:41:37,868 --> 00:41:41,288
Give me a hard time, I'll report you loaded,
drunk or stealing.

441
00:41:41,413 --> 00:41:43,248
I'll violate you back fast.

442
00:41:43,498 --> 00:41:46,209
Twenty-five percent of your take-home
kicks back to me.

443
00:41:46,334 --> 00:41:50,547
Rules of the game. Call Grierson,
check it out. Change in the back.

444
00:41:56,928 --> 00:41:58,722
What are you waiting for?

445
00:42:18,491 --> 00:42:20,201
<i>Malibu Equity and Investments.</i>

446
00:42:20,326 --> 00:42:21,828
Roger Van Zant.

447
00:42:21,953 --> 00:42:23,079
<i>Please hold.</i>

448
00:42:26,833 --> 00:42:28,710
<i>This is Roger Van Zant.</i>

449
00:42:29,293 --> 00:42:31,087
I'm supposed to collect something.

450
00:42:31,504 --> 00:42:34,090
Someone will call you back
from another line.

451
00:42:35,633 --> 00:42:38,469
818-133-6089.

452
00:43:03,744 --> 00:43:07,999
<i>I got a package for you. There's a drive-in
on Centinela. 2:30 tomorrow.</i>

453
00:43:08,249 --> 00:43:10,209
Just send one man, alone.

454
00:43:36,068 --> 00:43:37,987
- Who was that guy?
- Nobody.

455
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,948
- Who was that guy?
- Nobody.

456
00:43:41,365 --> 00:43:43,283
I gotta know who he is! Who is he?

457
00:43:43,450 --> 00:43:44,576
He's nobody, Neil.

458
00:43:44,702 --> 00:43:48,163
He's a legit liquor wholesaler
from Las Vegas. Alan Marciano.

459
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:50,082
Chris will make up.

460
00:43:50,207 --> 00:43:52,835
- It's too late! I'm sick of it!
- Shut up!

461
00:43:54,545 --> 00:43:57,881
Here's the deal.
You'll give Chris one last shot.

462
00:43:58,006 --> 00:44:01,969
After that, he fucks up,
then I will finance setting you up myself...

463
00:44:02,219 --> 00:44:04,346
on my own, anywhere you want.

464
00:44:04,513 --> 00:44:06,181
Dominick will go with you.

465
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:08,684
And my word counts. But right now...

466
00:44:09,059 --> 00:44:11,353
you will give him the chance.

467
00:44:15,565 --> 00:44:17,192
Clean up. Go home.

468
00:44:18,568 --> 00:44:20,195
Clean up. Go home!

469
00:45:06,282 --> 00:45:07,575
Give me all your money.

470
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:09,702
You'll get smoked with that shit.

471
00:45:09,828 --> 00:45:10,995
Won't be you.

472
00:45:14,207 --> 00:45:16,251
He's coming in alone. Send him through.

473
00:45:47,031 --> 00:45:48,658
Vincent, hey, man.

474
00:45:51,911 --> 00:45:54,163
This is my brother, Richard. Vincent.

475
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:55,790
It's all right.

476
00:45:57,041 --> 00:45:58,918
What have you got for me?

477
00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:03,673
Before we even get into that, there's
this crew ripping rides all along the beach.

478
00:46:05,716 --> 00:46:07,885
Now, in the back of a trim shop...

479
00:46:08,052 --> 00:46:11,263
if somebody wants to pay
a little visit this weekend...

480
00:46:11,389 --> 00:46:14,517
they might find two Turbos
and a 911 Slope.

481
00:46:15,476 --> 00:46:18,145
You're looking to rid yourself
of your competition?

482
00:46:19,355 --> 00:46:21,023
I'm a good citizen.

483
00:46:21,148 --> 00:46:22,691
I'm Donald Duck.

484
00:46:23,025 --> 00:46:24,860
You got something to tell me?

485
00:46:26,529 --> 00:46:28,280
Check this out, cuz.

486
00:46:29,198 --> 00:46:32,493
How do I know if I tell you
what you need to know...

487
00:46:32,868 --> 00:46:36,205
that you're gonna do
what the fuck I need to get done.

488
00:46:36,914 --> 00:46:38,666
Hanna is straight up.

489
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:41,752
I ain't your cuz, you rat motherfucker.

490
00:46:41,877 --> 00:46:44,171
And you know because I say so...

491
00:46:44,797 --> 00:46:47,591
after I hear what the fuck
you got to tell me!

492
00:46:47,716 --> 00:46:48,801
Fuck you.

493
00:46:48,926 --> 00:46:50,177
You understand?

494
00:46:50,469 --> 00:46:52,429
I can get killed for telling you this.

495
00:46:52,554 --> 00:46:54,765
You can get killed walking your doggie!

496
00:46:54,890 --> 00:46:56,183
All right, man...

497
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:59,144
there was a cat I was locked up with.

498
00:46:59,311 --> 00:47:03,649
Did a couple of two, three years.
He got out. I ran into him.

499
00:47:06,568 --> 00:47:07,694
And so?

500
00:47:08,153 --> 00:47:10,781
He's a big fiend for action.

501
00:47:10,906 --> 00:47:14,534
Now, if he'd have said nothing,
I'd have thought nothing, but...

502
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:18,038
he goes on and on,
telling me how he ain't done nothing...

503
00:47:18,163 --> 00:47:20,916
and nothing's been going on,
and all this bullshit.

504
00:47:21,041 --> 00:47:23,001
Right then and there I know...

505
00:47:23,585 --> 00:47:26,213
this cat's got something going down.

506
00:47:33,804 --> 00:47:35,514
Pretty fucking great.

507
00:47:37,265 --> 00:47:39,476
Albert, what's wrong with you?

508
00:47:40,227 --> 00:47:43,688
You drag me here,
waste my time like this.

509
00:47:43,814 --> 00:47:46,816
You saw a guy on the street
who's an ex-con?

510
00:47:46,942 --> 00:47:47,984
That's right.

511
00:47:48,109 --> 00:47:49,569
Well, I am...

512
00:47:49,778 --> 00:47:51,446
over-fucking-whelmed.

513
00:47:51,863 --> 00:47:54,366
What do you want for that,
a junior G-man badge?

514
00:47:54,783 --> 00:47:57,118
You gonna make the call
on them Porsches?

515
00:47:58,036 --> 00:47:59,371
Is he kidding me?

516
00:48:00,789 --> 00:48:01,831
I'm telling you:

517
00:48:01,956 --> 00:48:03,500
This Slick is no joke.

518
00:48:03,958 --> 00:48:05,460
He's double time.

519
00:48:05,585 --> 00:48:06,795
Say what?

520
00:48:07,545 --> 00:48:09,464
"Slick." What does that mean?

521
00:48:09,631 --> 00:48:12,050
That's what he calls people: "Slick."

522
00:48:13,676 --> 00:48:15,303
Tell me about him.

523
00:48:17,555 --> 00:48:19,390
About 6 feet tall...

524
00:48:19,682 --> 00:48:21,643
lots of jailhouse tats.

525
00:48:21,768 --> 00:48:23,895
Got a big-ass peacock right here.

526
00:48:26,439 --> 00:48:27,899
What's his name?

527
00:48:28,816 --> 00:48:30,109
Cheritto.

528
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:32,987
Michael Cheritto.

529
00:48:36,824 --> 00:48:39,410
<i>Thirty-three busts since 1976.</i>

530
00:48:39,535 --> 00:48:42,080
<i>Eleven for armed robbery,
three convictions.</i>

531
00:48:42,246 --> 00:48:44,874
<i>Two out of a three-to-five year beef
in Attica.</i>

532
00:48:44,999 --> 00:48:46,167
Three years in Marion.

533
00:48:46,292 --> 00:48:49,545
Five years in Folsom off a knock-back
to involuntary manslaughter.

534
00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:50,922
<i>Jacket's two inches thick.</i>

535
00:48:51,047 --> 00:48:52,965
Who do I have there now?

536
00:48:53,091 --> 00:48:55,802
<i>- Drucker and me. And Schwartz.
- Tell SIS...</i>

537
00:48:55,927 --> 00:48:59,805
I want full surveillance. That's 24 hours.
Round the clock, day and night.

538
00:48:59,931 --> 00:49:02,099
We never close. Open every day.

539
00:49:02,350 --> 00:49:04,143
<i>Bug the car, the house, the work.</i>

540
00:49:04,268 --> 00:49:06,479
<i>When he moves or sits,
like in a restaurant...</i>

541
00:49:06,604 --> 00:49:09,065
<i>I want pictures of who he moves
and sits with.</i>

542
00:49:09,190 --> 00:49:12,485
Then run makes on them.
They got jackets, trail them.

543
00:49:12,985 --> 00:49:15,446
I want it up and running
by tomorrow night.

544
00:50:10,959 --> 00:50:13,128
Put your hands where I can see them.

545
00:50:13,378 --> 00:50:15,547
Put your hands where I can see them.

546
00:50:16,423 --> 00:50:17,799
I tell you what to do.

547
00:50:17,925 --> 00:50:19,635
I tell you how to do it.

548
00:50:20,469 --> 00:50:23,889
Now, with your right hand only,
your right hand only...

549
00:50:25,557 --> 00:50:27,976
take the package and throw it in here.

550
00:50:45,869 --> 00:50:46,995
Behind you.

551
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:48,330
<i>On the right.</i>

552
00:52:07,658 --> 00:52:09,076
Roger Van Zant.

553
00:52:09,702 --> 00:52:10,828
Who's this?

554
00:52:11,329 --> 00:52:12,788
You know who this is.

555
00:52:13,706 --> 00:52:14,999
Yes, I do.

556
00:52:15,541 --> 00:52:17,501
<i>I sent a guy to deliver the package.</i>

557
00:52:17,627 --> 00:52:19,795
He didn't call. Is everything okay?

558
00:52:20,630 --> 00:52:22,840
<i>I tell you what, forget the money.</i>

559
00:52:23,424 --> 00:52:24,467
What?

560
00:52:25,217 --> 00:52:26,844
Forget the money.

561
00:52:29,388 --> 00:52:33,434
It's a lot of money. What are you doing?
What do you mean, "Forget the money"?

562
00:52:33,559 --> 00:52:36,437
What am I doing?
I'm talking to an empty telephone.

563
00:52:37,354 --> 00:52:38,772
I don't understand.

564
00:52:39,356 --> 00:52:42,526
'Cause there is a dead man
on the other end of this line.

565
00:53:03,756 --> 00:53:05,007
Do you like it?

566
00:53:05,132 --> 00:53:06,508
Look at my ring.

567
00:53:11,930 --> 00:53:13,140
Did you know?

568
00:53:14,683 --> 00:53:16,185
You are insane.

569
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:22,566
Do you like it?

570
00:53:22,691 --> 00:53:24,651
- It's beautiful.
- It's good.

571
00:53:24,818 --> 00:53:26,737
Don't ask him where he got it.

572
00:53:35,537 --> 00:53:37,873
What do you want to be
when you grow up?

573
00:53:38,248 --> 00:53:39,416
I don't know.

574
00:53:42,502 --> 00:53:43,879
Just like me.

575
00:53:44,004 --> 00:53:45,505
I don't know either.

576
00:54:00,103 --> 00:54:01,146
Hello?

577
00:54:01,855 --> 00:54:03,064
It's me.

578
00:54:04,816 --> 00:54:06,860
I was wondering if you'd call.

579
00:54:08,528 --> 00:54:09,821
I've been busy.

580
00:54:10,155 --> 00:54:11,448
Can I see you?

581
00:54:11,906 --> 00:54:13,783
I was afraid that was just...

582
00:54:14,743 --> 00:54:16,286
the one night.

583
00:54:17,454 --> 00:54:19,289
Not for me, it wasn't.

584
00:54:21,833 --> 00:54:23,293
Yeah, me neither.

585
00:54:25,503 --> 00:54:26,963
Can I fall by?

586
00:54:28,339 --> 00:54:29,424
Yeah.

587
00:54:29,674 --> 00:54:31,551
I'll see you in a little bit.

588
00:54:46,691 --> 00:54:48,359
Goddamn convention.

589
00:54:49,652 --> 00:54:51,821
- Which one's Slick?
- The wide one.

590
00:54:52,155 --> 00:54:53,823
We got two transmitters.

591
00:54:54,115 --> 00:54:56,868
One's in the wheel well,
backup's in the firewall.

592
00:54:56,993 --> 00:54:58,036
Here we are.

593
00:54:58,161 --> 00:55:00,121
Did you say goodnight to Neil?

594
00:55:00,872 --> 00:55:02,832
The blond is Chris Shiherlis.

595
00:55:02,957 --> 00:55:06,461
SIS has got a revolving tail
and hung a wire on the house phone.

596
00:55:09,005 --> 00:55:12,133
Cheritto's cruised the precious-metals
depository three times.

597
00:55:12,258 --> 00:55:14,552
Platinum, silver, and some bullion.

598
00:55:15,553 --> 00:55:18,139
Sammy and I think that will be
their next score.

599
00:55:18,264 --> 00:55:19,599
Who's the loner?

600
00:55:22,810 --> 00:55:24,270
First time we've seen him.

601
00:55:24,395 --> 00:55:25,938
We're not on him yet.

602
00:55:28,107 --> 00:55:29,400
Get on it.

603
00:55:47,251 --> 00:55:51,922
When these guys walk out the door of
whatever score they're gonna take next...

604
00:55:53,883 --> 00:55:57,011
they're gonna have the surprise
of a lifetime.

605
00:56:12,776 --> 00:56:14,403
Baby, time to go.

606
00:56:16,029 --> 00:56:18,407
Showed you a good time, didn't I?

607
00:56:21,952 --> 00:56:23,078
You fly.

608
00:56:23,287 --> 00:56:24,538
You're cool.

609
00:56:32,170 --> 00:56:35,882
You're lying to me.
I can always tell when people lie to me.

610
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,093
I ain't lying.

611
00:56:38,844 --> 00:56:40,304
You're a hot dog.

612
00:56:40,971 --> 00:56:42,764
A regular rodeo rider.

613
00:56:43,473 --> 00:56:46,476
And this was the monster fuck
of my young life.

614
00:56:51,022 --> 00:56:53,775
Now, I got to get my ass
street-side, sugar.

615
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:56,111
You don't have a truth-telling style.

616
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:58,113
What are you talking about?

617
00:56:58,321 --> 00:57:00,407
You don't know what this is.

618
00:57:06,955 --> 00:57:09,416
The Grim Reaper's visiting with you.

619
00:57:28,184 --> 00:57:29,519
Where have you been?

620
00:57:31,146 --> 00:57:32,814
SHU at Pelican Bay.

621
00:57:33,189 --> 00:57:34,899
Folsom, B-wing.

622
00:57:35,859 --> 00:57:37,402
I am a cowboy...

623
00:57:38,236 --> 00:57:40,113
looking for anything heavy.

624
00:57:40,238 --> 00:57:42,323
Billy said to come see you.

625
00:57:43,074 --> 00:57:44,909
That is why I am here.

626
00:57:53,918 --> 00:57:56,587
Why don't you call this guy?

627
00:57:57,672 --> 00:57:59,882
This guy's always putting guys on.

628
00:58:04,011 --> 00:58:05,054
Thank you.

629
00:58:19,569 --> 00:58:21,404
You're perfect for each other.

630
00:58:27,243 --> 00:58:29,120
I knew a guy in grade school.

631
00:58:29,495 --> 00:58:31,789
His name was Raoul... whatever.

632
00:58:31,914 --> 00:58:35,459
You could take his fingers
and fold them over each other.

633
00:58:35,751 --> 00:58:37,795
He'd turn his eyelids inside out...

634
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:40,881
I can't keep my hands off you.
That's the truth.

635
00:58:42,425 --> 00:58:45,052
That's what's so wonderful
about you in that...

636
00:58:45,177 --> 00:58:46,804
bestial sort of way.

637
00:58:51,517 --> 00:58:52,601
Woman.

638
00:58:59,441 --> 00:59:01,277
This better be earth-shattering.

639
00:59:08,284 --> 00:59:09,660
This is to Raoul.

640
00:59:12,037 --> 00:59:13,664
Yeah, Vincent Hanna.

641
00:59:55,997 --> 00:59:57,791
Here's how we found her.

642
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:02,963
How old?

643
01:00:03,088 --> 01:00:06,133
Sixteen, seventeen.
Been here about six hours.

644
01:00:06,967 --> 01:00:08,385
How'd she die?

645
01:00:08,510 --> 01:00:11,888
Beat her head in, same as the others.
Cerebral hematoma.

646
01:00:14,808 --> 01:00:15,934
Who's that?

647
01:00:16,518 --> 01:00:17,769
Mother and siblings.

648
01:00:17,894 --> 01:00:19,688
- Why are they here?
- It's fucked up.

649
01:00:19,813 --> 01:00:22,691
Somebody inside knew the girl
and called the family.

650
01:00:23,858 --> 01:00:24,985
Let's go.

651
01:00:29,781 --> 01:00:30,824
Nice.

652
01:00:31,783 --> 01:00:35,745
My intuition says the DNA check on
the semen will show it's the same guy...

653
01:00:35,870 --> 01:00:38,915
so it's a series and ending up
in your court.

654
01:00:39,290 --> 01:00:40,834
Sheriff's getting anywhere?

655
01:00:40,959 --> 01:00:42,168
Not yet.

656
01:00:43,545 --> 01:00:45,004
Get off of me!

657
01:00:47,966 --> 01:00:49,175
Oh, my God!

658
01:00:53,554 --> 01:00:54,722
Where is she?

659
01:00:55,056 --> 01:00:56,599
Easy, easy, easy.

660
01:00:59,894 --> 01:01:01,354
Please, come on.

661
01:01:04,273 --> 01:01:06,109
It's okay.

662
01:01:07,402 --> 01:01:08,861
Where is my baby?

663
01:01:09,070 --> 01:01:10,196
Where is she?

664
01:01:11,072 --> 01:01:13,241
I need to know what happened.

665
01:01:55,491 --> 01:01:57,576
I guess the earth shattered.

666
01:01:58,410 --> 01:02:01,163
So why didn't you let Bosko
take you home?

667
01:02:03,123 --> 01:02:05,376
I didn't want to ruin their night, too.

668
01:02:05,834 --> 01:02:07,127
What was it?

669
01:02:09,255 --> 01:02:10,714
You don't want to know.

670
01:02:10,839 --> 01:02:13,676
I'd like to know what's behind
that grim look on your face.

671
01:02:13,801 --> 01:02:16,220
I don't do that. You know it. Let's go.

672
01:02:16,887 --> 01:02:19,556
You never told me I'd be excluded.

673
01:02:21,850 --> 01:02:23,811
I told you when we hooked up...

674
01:02:23,936 --> 01:02:26,146
that you'd have to share me...

675
01:02:26,271 --> 01:02:29,983
with all the bad people
and all the ugly events on this planet.

676
01:02:30,192 --> 01:02:32,319
And I bought into that sharing...

677
01:02:32,653 --> 01:02:34,238
because I love you.

678
01:02:34,696 --> 01:02:38,408
I love you fat, bald, money,
no money, driving a bus.

679
01:02:38,575 --> 01:02:39,743
I don't care.

680
01:02:40,953 --> 01:02:43,664
But you have got to be present
like a normal guy.

681
01:02:43,789 --> 01:02:46,792
That's sharing.
This is not sharing, this is leftovers.

682
01:02:46,959 --> 01:02:49,962
What I should do is come home and say:

683
01:02:50,462 --> 01:02:54,049
"Hi, honey, guess what?
I walked into this house today...

684
01:02:54,174 --> 01:02:58,053
"where this junkie asshole
just fried his baby in a microwave...

685
01:02:58,178 --> 01:03:01,640
"because he was crying too loud,
so let me share that with you.

686
01:03:01,765 --> 01:03:04,559
"Come on, let's share that
and in sharing it...

687
01:03:04,810 --> 01:03:09,731
"we'll somehow cathartically dispel
all that heinous shit."

688
01:03:09,981 --> 01:03:11,107
Right?

689
01:03:13,485 --> 01:03:14,653
Wrong.

690
01:03:14,778 --> 01:03:15,904
You know why?

691
01:03:16,029 --> 01:03:18,240
'Cause you prefer the normal routine.

692
01:03:18,365 --> 01:03:20,575
We fuck and you don't speak.

693
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:22,827
'Cause I got to hold on to my angst.

694
01:03:23,495 --> 01:03:24,871
I preserve it...

695
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:28,416
because I need it.
It keeps me sharp, on the edge.

696
01:03:28,917 --> 01:03:30,210
Where I gotta be.

697
01:03:37,592 --> 01:03:39,302
You don't live with me.

698
01:03:41,888 --> 01:03:44,516
You live among the remains
of dead people.

699
01:03:48,606 --> 01:03:50,358
You read the terrain.

700
01:03:51,693 --> 01:03:54,070
You search for signs of passing...

701
01:03:54,779 --> 01:03:56,781
for the scent of your prey...

702
01:03:56,906 --> 01:03:58,867
and then you hunt them down.

703
01:04:00,535 --> 01:04:03,204
That's the only thing you're committed to.

704
01:04:06,457 --> 01:04:09,294
The rest is the mess you leave
as you pass through.

705
01:04:14,799 --> 01:04:18,219
What I don't understand is
why I can't cut loose of you.

706
01:04:37,989 --> 01:04:39,490
Let's go, baby.

707
01:04:42,326 --> 01:04:43,953
I met the manager.

708
01:04:44,412 --> 01:04:45,872
Is that the boss?

709
01:04:46,998 --> 01:04:49,917
I did time for what that motherfucker
does every day.

710
01:04:50,334 --> 01:04:53,754
Can you just handle it
till we find you something new?

711
01:04:54,839 --> 01:04:56,424
Can you do that?

712
01:04:58,509 --> 01:05:01,429
Ain't a hard time been invented
that I cannot handle.

713
01:05:07,601 --> 01:05:09,437
Why're you hanging with me?

714
01:05:11,313 --> 01:05:13,149
Because I'm proud of you.

715
01:05:19,113 --> 01:05:20,531
You're proud of me?

716
01:05:25,536 --> 01:05:27,621
Why the hell are you proud of me?

717
01:05:29,206 --> 01:05:30,583
Come on home.

718
01:05:41,468 --> 01:05:43,137
What were you doing there?

719
01:05:43,387 --> 01:05:44,805
I was skiing.

720
01:05:45,055 --> 01:05:46,807
I was trying to ski.

721
01:05:47,641 --> 01:05:50,561
That's what people do there.
You go skiing...

722
01:05:51,395 --> 01:05:53,188
and you meet people.

723
01:05:53,564 --> 01:05:55,107
You try to have a good time.

724
01:05:55,232 --> 01:05:56,859
- Did you have a good time?
- No.

725
01:05:56,984 --> 01:05:58,110
Why not?

726
01:05:58,485 --> 01:06:00,445
I'm not good at meeting people.

727
01:06:00,904 --> 01:06:02,239
You met me.

728
01:06:03,031 --> 01:06:05,492
That happened without my thinking
about it.

729
01:06:05,993 --> 01:06:07,869
Which is why I probably...

730
01:06:08,537 --> 01:06:10,580
No, it's because you are fine.

731
01:06:15,919 --> 01:06:17,879
Take off with me for a while.

732
01:06:19,339 --> 01:06:20,382
Where?

733
01:06:20,882 --> 01:06:22,217
New Zealand.

734
01:06:23,552 --> 01:06:24,636
When?

735
01:06:26,346 --> 01:06:28,890
I have to go separate.
You can meet me there.

736
01:06:29,432 --> 01:06:30,892
But my job...

737
01:06:31,017 --> 01:06:33,145
I got money. You don't need money.

738
01:06:33,270 --> 01:06:35,689
You could set up a studio and work there.

739
01:06:36,189 --> 01:06:37,315
I don't know.

740
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:38,942
What's there to know?

741
01:06:39,109 --> 01:06:40,569
Are you married?

742
01:06:42,195 --> 01:06:43,321
What?

743
01:06:43,446 --> 01:06:45,490
The last thing I am is married.

744
01:06:45,699 --> 01:06:48,576
I'm a needle starting at zero
going the other way.

745
01:06:48,785 --> 01:06:50,453
Then, all of a sudden...

746
01:06:51,413 --> 01:06:53,415
someone like you comes along.

747
01:06:56,918 --> 01:06:58,044
You don't know me.

748
01:06:58,169 --> 01:06:59,629
I know enough.

749
01:07:03,633 --> 01:07:05,009
Come with me.

750
01:07:14,936 --> 01:07:16,354
What's wrong?

751
01:07:18,147 --> 01:07:20,942
Nothing's wrong. Everything's right.
Will you go?

752
01:07:25,947 --> 01:07:26,948
Yeah.

753
01:07:30,743 --> 01:07:31,744
Good.

754
01:07:56,686 --> 01:07:58,062
Hi, sweetie.

755
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:01,941
You forget your mom was picking you up?

756
01:08:03,651 --> 01:08:04,777
No.

757
01:08:06,779 --> 01:08:08,489
So, what's going on?

758
01:08:10,366 --> 01:08:12,076
I felt like being alone.

759
01:08:15,037 --> 01:08:16,914
Come on, I'll drive you home.

760
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:14,846
What's happening?

761
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:17,766
Sir.

762
01:09:17,891 --> 01:09:20,519
Captain Jackson wants to know
what's going on.

763
01:09:20,686 --> 01:09:23,105
Nothing's going on. Stay off the air.

764
01:10:17,826 --> 01:10:19,077
Technique.

765
01:10:38,638 --> 01:10:40,598
Open Sesame. Right there.

766
01:11:38,405 --> 01:11:39,782
There he is.

767
01:12:41,927 --> 01:12:43,011
We walk!

768
01:12:43,136 --> 01:12:44,262
I'm there.

769
01:12:44,387 --> 01:12:45,514
We walk! Now!

770
01:13:00,570 --> 01:13:01,863
He's heard it.

771
01:13:10,288 --> 01:13:11,539
Heads up.

772
01:13:13,249 --> 01:13:15,335
- One's coming out.
- Hold it, Captain.

773
01:13:15,460 --> 01:13:17,754
Vincent, he's not carrying anything.

774
01:13:18,004 --> 01:13:19,005
I see.

775
01:13:22,217 --> 01:13:24,469
- Here we go.
- Not till my boss says so.

776
01:13:24,594 --> 01:13:26,930
Both of them are not carrying anything.

777
01:13:36,064 --> 01:13:37,690
<i>- Let them go.
- What do you mean?</i>

778
01:13:37,815 --> 01:13:38,858
<i>We can take them...</i>

779
01:13:38,983 --> 01:13:40,068
On what?

780
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:42,153
They didn't steal anything yet.

781
01:13:42,570 --> 01:13:47,116
It gets knocked back to a misdemeanor,
they do six months and they're out.

782
01:13:47,241 --> 01:13:48,451
No fucking way.

783
01:13:48,576 --> 01:13:51,788
I'm not taking the heat from my boss.
They are not walking.

784
01:13:51,913 --> 01:13:55,458
That's exactly what they'll do.
They'll walk. This is my operation.

785
01:13:55,583 --> 01:13:58,336
I have tactical command
that supersedes your rank.

786
01:13:58,461 --> 01:14:01,589
They will walk away
and you will let them. Fuck!

787
01:14:47,509 --> 01:14:48,928
Back to work.

788
01:14:50,888 --> 01:14:54,516
LAPD, the G, what?
Where the fuck did this heat come from?

789
01:14:55,142 --> 01:14:58,103
Maybe it's the score they were onto.
The place, not us.

790
01:14:58,228 --> 01:15:00,689
Because it's been hit a couple of times.

791
01:15:00,898 --> 01:15:04,985
Assume they got our phones, our houses,
that they got us right here, right now...

792
01:15:05,110 --> 01:15:07,571
as we sit. Everything. Assume it all.

793
01:15:08,071 --> 01:15:10,115
How will we buy the bank package?

794
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:11,742
I'll front that.

795
01:15:11,909 --> 01:15:13,577
What about Van Zant?

796
01:15:13,827 --> 01:15:17,831
With the heat we got, you want to play
World War II on the streets with Van Zant?

797
01:15:17,956 --> 01:15:19,374
No, I want my 750.

798
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:24,212
I got more motivation to whack Van Zant
than either of you. He is a fucking luxury.

799
01:15:24,338 --> 01:15:26,965
Our problem is to take the bank,
or split right now.

800
01:15:27,257 --> 01:15:29,635
Do not go home, do not pack, nothing.

801
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:34,222
Thirty seconds flat from now, we are gone
on our separate ways. That's it.

802
01:15:39,311 --> 01:15:41,271
The bank is worth the risk.

803
01:15:41,521 --> 01:15:42,981
I need it, brother.

804
01:15:44,649 --> 01:15:47,819
We should stay and take it down.
That's where I come out.

805
01:15:58,872 --> 01:16:00,957
I roll with you, Neil. Whatever.

806
01:16:01,416 --> 01:16:03,209
- Whatever.
- Not on this one.

807
01:16:03,335 --> 01:16:05,295
On this one, you're on your own.

808
01:16:18,266 --> 01:16:20,310
You figure this is the best thing to do?

809
01:16:20,643 --> 01:16:22,645
This is the best thing to do?

810
01:16:22,771 --> 01:16:26,941
I've got plans, I'm going away after,
so the reward is worth the stretch.

811
01:16:27,066 --> 01:16:29,944
But Elaine takes good care of you.
You got plenty put away.

812
01:16:30,069 --> 01:16:31,821
You got T-bonds, real estate.

813
01:16:31,946 --> 01:16:34,741
If I were you, I would be smart
and cut loose of this.

814
01:16:53,676 --> 01:16:54,927
For me...

815
01:16:55,053 --> 01:16:57,096
the action is the juice.

816
01:16:57,889 --> 01:16:58,890
I'm in.

817
01:17:04,645 --> 01:17:05,938
Yeah, sure.

818
01:17:06,272 --> 01:17:07,356
Let's go.

819
01:17:08,191 --> 01:17:09,984
Fuck them, let's do it.

820
01:17:10,109 --> 01:17:12,361
Let's go. We got a lot of work to do.

821
01:17:29,879 --> 01:17:31,672
Tim, I gotta call you back.

822
01:17:32,006 --> 01:17:34,341
- Can I help you?
- Are you Alan Marciano?

823
01:17:34,550 --> 01:17:35,843
Who the fuck are you?

824
01:17:35,968 --> 01:17:37,094
Who am I?

825
01:17:37,845 --> 01:17:40,014
Lieutenant Vincent Hanna, LAPD.

826
01:17:40,139 --> 01:17:43,559
LA? This is Las Vegas.
You don't even have jurisdiction here.

827
01:17:45,019 --> 01:17:48,689
Do you know who you're pushing around?
I know people here.

828
01:17:48,814 --> 01:17:51,734
Las Vegas PD takes you into custody.

829
01:17:53,235 --> 01:17:57,364
You are extradited to Newark
on a warrant for smuggling cigarettes...

830
01:17:57,489 --> 01:17:59,575
up from North Carolina three years ago...

831
01:17:59,700 --> 01:18:01,660
or you go to work for us.

832
01:18:02,161 --> 01:18:03,620
Cut and dried.

833
01:18:04,079 --> 01:18:05,414
That is it.

834
01:18:05,748 --> 01:18:06,790
Shit.

835
01:18:07,791 --> 01:18:09,460
Charlene Shiherlis.

836
01:18:09,626 --> 01:18:10,669
Who?

837
01:18:10,836 --> 01:18:11,879
Who?

838
01:18:12,296 --> 01:18:14,089
What are you, a fucking owl?

839
01:18:14,256 --> 01:18:18,135
The lady you been talking dirty to
on the telephone every day last week.

840
01:18:18,594 --> 01:18:20,220
You can't tie me to her.

841
01:18:20,470 --> 01:18:24,516
Who needs to? Your ass is on a plane
back to New Jersey, jackoff.

842
01:18:26,852 --> 01:18:28,478
Why did I get mixed up with her?

843
01:18:28,604 --> 01:18:31,690
Because she's got a great ass!

844
01:18:32,858 --> 01:18:35,527
And you got your head all the way up it.

845
01:18:36,528 --> 01:18:37,571
Jesus.

846
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:39,740
Ferocious, aren't I?

847
01:18:40,198 --> 01:18:41,950
When I think of asses...

848
01:18:42,075 --> 01:18:43,535
a woman's ass...

849
01:18:44,119 --> 01:18:45,996
something comes out of me.

850
01:18:47,038 --> 01:18:48,039
So?

851
01:18:48,206 --> 01:18:49,791
So, no big thing.

852
01:18:50,584 --> 01:18:52,043
All I want...

853
01:18:52,419 --> 01:18:55,046
is her husband
and his whole fucking crew.

854
01:18:55,297 --> 01:18:57,048
You'll work with Sgt. Drucker.

855
01:19:02,053 --> 01:19:04,431
San Clemente Road and Hermosa...

856
01:19:04,764 --> 01:19:07,684
that's where we cut through the fence.
That's the access.

857
01:19:07,809 --> 01:19:08,852
Right.

858
01:19:09,060 --> 01:19:11,563
The security systems around here
are a joke.

859
01:19:16,443 --> 01:19:19,237
St. Vincent Thomas Bridge,
that's escape route No. 1.

860
01:19:20,113 --> 01:19:21,197
No. 2:

861
01:19:21,322 --> 01:19:23,491
<i>Over here. Anaheim to the 110.</i>

862
01:19:23,700 --> 01:19:24,743
Good.

863
01:19:25,034 --> 01:19:26,077
You got it?

864
01:19:26,202 --> 01:19:27,579
Good. Let's go.

865
01:19:50,268 --> 01:19:51,811
They were looking back...

866
01:19:53,312 --> 01:19:54,814
in this direction.

867
01:19:55,648 --> 01:19:57,358
A container facility?

868
01:19:57,483 --> 01:19:58,985
What? Cartage theft?

869
01:19:59,110 --> 01:20:01,821
Too visible. Too lowball for them.

870
01:20:05,992 --> 01:20:08,202
There's an oil refinery and a scrap yard.

871
01:20:08,327 --> 01:20:09,662
Refinery only pays by check.

872
01:20:09,787 --> 01:20:11,038
No cash around.

873
01:20:11,372 --> 01:20:12,915
Same for the scrap yard.

874
01:20:16,460 --> 01:20:17,753
Stealing hubcaps?

875
01:20:21,924 --> 01:20:24,260
A refinery and a scrap yard.

876
01:20:25,511 --> 01:20:27,346
What the hell is going on?

877
01:20:27,471 --> 01:20:29,557
That's what we are trying to figure out.

878
01:20:30,141 --> 01:20:31,892
We thought we had it.

879
01:20:32,685 --> 01:20:33,978
Thought we had it.

880
01:20:43,696 --> 01:20:45,239
I got an idea...

881
01:20:46,198 --> 01:20:48,117
on what they were looking at.

882
01:20:51,829 --> 01:20:54,039
Want to know what they're looking at?

883
01:20:55,874 --> 01:20:58,752
I mean, is this guy something,
or is he something?

884
01:21:00,212 --> 01:21:02,214
This crew is good.

885
01:21:04,466 --> 01:21:06,093
Know what they're looking at?

886
01:21:07,052 --> 01:21:08,095
What?

887
01:21:09,513 --> 01:21:10,514
Us.

888
01:21:11,974 --> 01:21:13,475
The LAPD.

889
01:21:14,059 --> 01:21:15,894
The police department.

890
01:21:17,271 --> 01:21:18,730
We just got made.

891
01:21:26,864 --> 01:21:27,906
Yeah!

892
01:21:36,498 --> 01:21:37,541
Okay!

893
01:21:47,300 --> 01:21:49,177
Okay, motherfucker!

894
01:22:09,656 --> 01:22:11,116
Kelso come through?

895
01:22:11,491 --> 01:22:13,952
Yeah, you can build a bank with these.

896
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,418
Name is Hanna.

897
01:22:21,751 --> 01:22:23,211
First name, Vincent.

898
01:22:23,837 --> 01:22:25,797
I smeared this sergeant five yards.

899
01:22:25,922 --> 01:22:27,424
Hanna's all over you.

900
01:22:28,258 --> 01:22:30,969
He's on all the work cars.
Michael's house. Shiherlis's.

901
01:22:31,094 --> 01:22:33,471
Not yours. They've been
losing you at night.

902
01:22:33,596 --> 01:22:34,848
He's a hot dog.

903
01:22:35,140 --> 01:22:37,392
Graduate school. Marine Corps.

904
01:22:38,017 --> 01:22:39,811
Lieutenant in Robbery-Homicide.

905
01:22:39,936 --> 01:22:43,481
He's taken down some heavy crews.
He blew away Frankie in Chicago.

906
01:22:43,606 --> 01:22:45,233
He was a fucking maniac.

907
01:22:46,109 --> 01:22:48,319
He was working Narcotics before that.

908
01:22:48,861 --> 01:22:51,197
Divorced twice. Current wife's Justine.

909
01:22:51,322 --> 01:22:52,949
He's why the extra heat.

910
01:22:55,785 --> 01:22:57,412
The vice sergeant...

911
01:22:58,788 --> 01:23:00,665
says Hanna likes you...

912
01:23:01,666 --> 01:23:05,086
thinks you're some kind of star.
You do this sharp, that sharp.

913
01:23:05,211 --> 01:23:07,672
Look how sharp this guy is to figure that.

914
01:23:10,133 --> 01:23:11,592
Funny as a heart attack.

915
01:23:11,717 --> 01:23:15,221
Three marriages? Do you think
that means he likes staying home?

916
01:23:15,972 --> 01:23:18,391
Means he's one of those guys out there...

917
01:23:18,641 --> 01:23:21,310
prowling around all night, dedicated.

918
01:23:23,688 --> 01:23:26,107
With him and this much heat,
you should pass.

919
01:23:33,447 --> 01:23:35,032
It's worth the stretch.

920
01:23:36,033 --> 01:23:37,993
This guy can hit or miss.

921
01:23:38,494 --> 01:23:40,121
You can't miss once.

922
01:23:40,955 --> 01:23:42,081
You sure?

923
01:23:43,249 --> 01:23:44,542
I am sure.

924
01:23:50,673 --> 01:23:52,133
Let's go to the garage.

925
01:24:20,494 --> 01:24:21,912
Where are we going?

926
01:24:27,251 --> 01:24:28,710
Where are you going?

927
01:24:29,086 --> 01:24:30,087
Out.

928
01:25:28,812 --> 01:25:29,813
What are they on?

929
01:25:29,938 --> 01:25:31,147
<i>TAC 9.</i>

930
01:25:33,066 --> 01:25:36,986
<i>They're northbound out LAX on the 405.
We got four ground units.</i>

931
01:25:55,713 --> 01:25:58,424
<i>This is Vincent Hanna in Air 18.
Who have I got?</i>

932
01:25:58,841 --> 01:26:01,052
<i>This is JJ. I'm in Air 40.</i>

933
01:26:01,177 --> 01:26:04,347
<i>Richard Glover's with me.
It's on the 105 eastbound...</i>

934
01:26:04,472 --> 01:26:06,307
<i>approaching the 110.</i>

935
01:26:07,517 --> 01:26:08,976
Revolving tail?

936
01:26:09,143 --> 01:26:11,854
<i>I got two units in front, three behind.</i>

937
01:26:11,979 --> 01:26:15,191
Have one of them pick me up
at the Vermont on-ramp.

938
01:26:16,234 --> 01:26:17,485
Let's go.

939
01:27:07,576 --> 01:27:11,538
Am I 100 yards, or what?
Am I close or far, or what?

940
01:27:11,705 --> 01:27:13,707
<i>Three hundred yards, center lane.</i>

941
01:28:20,899 --> 01:28:22,192
How're you doing?

942
01:28:25,904 --> 01:28:28,531
What do you say I buy you a cup of coffee?

943
01:28:35,080 --> 01:28:36,373
Yeah, sure. Let's go.

944
01:28:37,123 --> 01:28:38,333
Follow me.

945
01:28:54,182 --> 01:28:55,975
Seven years in Folsom.

946
01:28:56,768 --> 01:28:58,561
In the hole for three.

947
01:28:58,728 --> 01:29:00,146
McNeil before that.

948
01:29:03,524 --> 01:29:05,485
McNeil as tough as they say?

949
01:29:06,736 --> 01:29:08,696
You looking to become a penologist?

950
01:29:09,947 --> 01:29:11,574
You looking to go back?

951
01:29:11,866 --> 01:29:16,037
I chased down some crews. Guys just
looking to fuck up, get busted back.

952
01:29:16,162 --> 01:29:17,246
That you?

953
01:29:18,372 --> 01:29:20,666
You must've worked some dipshit crews.

954
01:29:21,417 --> 01:29:23,127
I worked all kinds.

955
01:29:26,798 --> 01:29:30,718
You see me doing liquor store holdups
with a "Born to Lose" tattoo on my chest?

956
01:29:32,011 --> 01:29:33,095
I do not.

957
01:29:33,304 --> 01:29:34,347
Right.

958
01:29:35,890 --> 01:29:37,683
I am never going back.

959
01:29:39,477 --> 01:29:41,562
Then don't take down scores.

960
01:29:42,855 --> 01:29:44,482
I do what I do best:

961
01:29:44,690 --> 01:29:48,611
I take scores. You do what you do best:
Try to stop guys like me.

962
01:29:52,531 --> 01:29:54,742
You never wanted a regular-type life?

963
01:29:55,534 --> 01:29:58,204
What is that? Barbecues and ball games?

964
01:30:00,164 --> 01:30:01,207
Yeah.

965
01:30:03,709 --> 01:30:05,753
This regular-type life like your life?

966
01:30:06,420 --> 01:30:08,380
My life? No, my life...

967
01:30:10,174 --> 01:30:11,842
My life's a disaster zone.

968
01:30:13,719 --> 01:30:16,221
I got a stepdaughter so fucked up...

969
01:30:16,805 --> 01:30:19,850
because her real father
is this large-type asshole.

970
01:30:19,975 --> 01:30:21,018
I got a wife.

971
01:30:21,143 --> 01:30:23,979
We're passing each other
on the down slope of a marriage.

972
01:30:24,104 --> 01:30:25,147
My third.

973
01:30:27,358 --> 01:30:31,070
Because I spend all my time
chasing guys like you around the block.

974
01:30:31,195 --> 01:30:32,488
That's my life.

975
01:30:38,994 --> 01:30:40,746
A guy told me one time:

976
01:30:42,581 --> 01:30:46,960
"Don't get attached to anything
you can't walk out on in 30 seconds...

977
01:30:47,085 --> 01:30:49,504
"if you feel the heat around the corner."

978
01:30:51,006 --> 01:30:54,176
If you're on me and you got to move
when I move...

979
01:30:54,593 --> 01:30:57,596
how do you expect to keep a marriage?

980
01:30:59,473 --> 01:31:01,266
That's an interesting point.

981
01:31:02,851 --> 01:31:04,102
Are you a monk?

982
01:31:05,437 --> 01:31:06,646
I have a woman.

983
01:31:07,230 --> 01:31:08,690
What do you tell her?

984
01:31:11,151 --> 01:31:12,819
I tell her I'm a salesman.

985
01:31:19,659 --> 01:31:22,662
So, if you spot me coming
around that corner...

986
01:31:23,705 --> 01:31:25,582
you'll just walk out on her?

987
01:31:27,167 --> 01:31:28,752
Not say good-bye?

988
01:31:29,544 --> 01:31:31,171
That's the discipline.

989
01:31:32,047 --> 01:31:33,840
That's pretty vacant.

990
01:31:34,049 --> 01:31:35,675
It is what it is.

991
01:31:35,800 --> 01:31:38,553
It's that, or we both better go
do something else.

992
01:31:40,597 --> 01:31:42,557
I don't know how to do anything else.

993
01:31:43,058 --> 01:31:44,476
Neither do I.

994
01:31:47,312 --> 01:31:48,855
I don't want to either.

995
01:31:49,647 --> 01:31:50,815
Neither do I.

996
01:31:58,531 --> 01:32:01,117
You know, I have this recurring dream.

997
01:32:03,036 --> 01:32:05,955
I'm sitting at this big banquet table and...

998
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:09,626
all the victims of all the murders
I ever worked are there...

999
01:32:09,751 --> 01:32:13,671
and they're staring at me
with these black eyeballs...

1000
01:32:14,339 --> 01:32:18,259
because they got eight-ball hemorrhages
from the head wounds.

1001
01:32:19,552 --> 01:32:22,680
And there they are,
these big balloon people...

1002
01:32:23,097 --> 01:32:26,476
because I found them two weeks
after they'd been under the bed.

1003
01:32:27,268 --> 01:32:29,729
The neighbors reported the smell...

1004
01:32:30,730 --> 01:32:32,315
and there they are...

1005
01:32:32,440 --> 01:32:34,150
all just sitting there.

1006
01:32:36,402 --> 01:32:37,570
What do they say?

1007
01:32:39,614 --> 01:32:40,615
Nothing.

1008
01:32:41,073 --> 01:32:42,241
No talk?

1009
01:32:44,452 --> 01:32:46,203
They have nothing to say.

1010
01:32:47,121 --> 01:32:49,081
We just look at each other.

1011
01:32:50,082 --> 01:32:51,709
They look at me...

1012
01:32:52,251 --> 01:32:54,378
and that's it. That's the dream.

1013
01:32:57,256 --> 01:32:59,091
I have one where I'm drowning.

1014
01:32:59,884 --> 01:33:03,512
I gotta wake myself up and start breathing
or I'll die in my sleep.

1015
01:33:05,639 --> 01:33:06,974
Know what that's about?

1016
01:33:08,642 --> 01:33:10,060
Having enough time.

1017
01:33:11,770 --> 01:33:12,938
Enough time...

1018
01:33:13,397 --> 01:33:15,107
to do what you want to do?

1019
01:33:15,316 --> 01:33:16,567
That's right.

1020
01:33:19,111 --> 01:33:20,446
You doing it now?

1021
01:33:20,654 --> 01:33:21,864
No, not yet.

1022
01:33:27,494 --> 01:33:29,455
You know, we're sitting here...

1023
01:33:30,831 --> 01:33:33,042
like a couple of regular fellas.

1024
01:33:33,167 --> 01:33:36,003
You do what you do,
and I do what I gotta do.

1025
01:33:38,130 --> 01:33:40,466
Now that we've been face to face...

1026
01:33:43,469 --> 01:33:46,096
if I'm there and I gotta put you away...

1027
01:33:46,472 --> 01:33:47,931
I won't like it.

1028
01:33:48,807 --> 01:33:49,933
But, I tell you...

1029
01:33:52,519 --> 01:33:54,479
if it's between you...

1030
01:33:54,688 --> 01:33:58,483
and some poor bastard whose wife
you're gonna turn into a widow...

1031
01:33:59,484 --> 01:34:00,652
brother...

1032
01:34:01,153 --> 01:34:02,988
you are going down.

1033
01:34:15,542 --> 01:34:17,836
There's a flip side to that coin.

1034
01:34:20,172 --> 01:34:22,340
What if you do got me boxed in...

1035
01:34:22,799 --> 01:34:24,551
and I gotta put you down?

1036
01:34:25,719 --> 01:34:27,429
Because no matter what...

1037
01:34:27,929 --> 01:34:29,890
you won't get in my way.

1038
01:34:31,224 --> 01:34:33,435
We've been face to face, yeah.

1039
01:34:36,730 --> 01:34:38,440
But I will not hesitate.

1040
01:34:38,773 --> 01:34:40,108
Not for a second.

1041
01:34:46,656 --> 01:34:48,116
Maybe that'll happen.

1042
01:34:50,869 --> 01:34:51,870
Or...

1043
01:34:52,245 --> 01:34:53,538
who knows?

1044
01:34:54,164 --> 01:34:56,499
Maybe we'll never see each other again.

1045
01:35:12,515 --> 01:35:14,017
They dumped us.

1046
01:35:15,310 --> 01:35:16,352
What?

1047
01:35:16,811 --> 01:35:18,271
They dumped us.

1048
01:35:18,896 --> 01:35:20,106
What do you mean?

1049
01:35:20,231 --> 01:35:21,482
Chris slipped away.

1050
01:35:21,607 --> 01:35:23,484
He doesn't talk about their scores...

1051
01:35:23,609 --> 01:35:26,946
so there's nothing for me to get
from Marciano. I just tried.

1052
01:35:27,321 --> 01:35:29,282
- What about Cheritto?
- Same.

1053
01:35:29,407 --> 01:35:32,034
Transponders got put on a bus
to San Clemente.

1054
01:35:34,745 --> 01:35:36,497
They dumped all our surveillance?

1055
01:35:36,622 --> 01:35:38,833
Yes, at the same time. 9:00 p.m.

1056
01:35:40,126 --> 01:35:43,337
I had coffee with McCauley
half an hour ago!

1057
01:35:43,462 --> 01:35:44,505
We were on you.

1058
01:35:44,630 --> 01:35:48,509
Then McCauley drives in to LAX
where surveillance can't fly over.

1059
01:35:49,260 --> 01:35:51,637
His car's still there. He's gone.

1060
01:35:57,101 --> 01:36:01,605
Does anybody have any idea
where the fuck these people are?

1061
01:37:01,456 --> 01:37:02,499
Hear from him?

1062
01:37:03,417 --> 01:37:07,379
Not a thing. And not hearing
bothers me more. Where's this guy?

1063
01:37:09,923 --> 01:37:10,924
This guy...

1064
01:37:11,049 --> 01:37:12,509
we put him on.

1065
01:37:12,634 --> 01:37:14,261
Says he knows McCauley.

1066
01:37:20,016 --> 01:37:21,017
Who are you?

1067
01:37:22,227 --> 01:37:23,395
Waingro.

1068
01:37:23,979 --> 01:37:25,605
My name's Waingro.

1069
01:37:25,981 --> 01:37:29,151
I've been living in this office.
How well do you know him?

1070
01:37:30,569 --> 01:37:33,029
We took some major scores together.

1071
01:37:36,992 --> 01:37:38,868
Why haven't I heard from him?

1072
01:37:38,994 --> 01:37:40,870
He's probably busy right now.

1073
01:37:41,496 --> 01:37:43,123
But he's real thorough.

1074
01:37:44,499 --> 01:37:46,626
He ain't going to forget about you.

1075
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:48,336
That's reassuring.

1076
01:37:50,171 --> 01:37:52,632
I got some moves I could make here.

1077
01:37:53,758 --> 01:37:55,969
Probably be a big help to you.

1078
01:38:17,532 --> 01:38:19,158
You recognize the grill man?

1079
01:38:26,624 --> 01:38:27,667
No.

1080
01:38:27,792 --> 01:38:28,835
Folsom.

1081
01:38:28,960 --> 01:38:31,295
D-block. Housed with Dobie Rush.

1082
01:38:32,964 --> 01:38:34,424
I ain't got my break yet.

1083
01:38:34,549 --> 01:38:36,717
Cisco and Pancho didn't show.

1084
01:38:36,968 --> 01:38:39,595
Haul out the garbage. Mop up the back.

1085
01:38:39,929 --> 01:38:41,639
Take your break later.

1086
01:38:42,014 --> 01:38:43,432
Piece of shit.

1087
01:38:43,850 --> 01:38:44,976
Pick up!

1088
01:38:48,312 --> 01:38:49,730
Where the hell is he?

1089
01:38:49,856 --> 01:38:52,066
I want to check the slot for the work car.

1090
01:38:52,275 --> 01:38:53,359
So did I.

1091
01:39:01,325 --> 01:39:02,368
Hang on.

1092
01:39:05,371 --> 01:39:10,126
Use the land line. Call me at 103-7206.

1093
01:39:21,929 --> 01:39:23,097
Where are you?

1094
01:39:23,222 --> 01:39:25,933
There's cops all over me, man,
like a cheap suit.

1095
01:39:26,934 --> 01:39:28,269
I can't dump them.

1096
01:39:31,021 --> 01:39:32,815
They know you see them?

1097
01:39:33,107 --> 01:39:34,984
They're doing parallels.

1098
01:39:37,695 --> 01:39:39,238
I can try to dump them again.

1099
01:39:39,363 --> 01:39:41,323
<i>How are we going to know if you did?</i>

1100
01:39:41,448 --> 01:39:43,075
If not, you'll draw them to us.

1101
01:39:43,659 --> 01:39:44,743
Go to Ventura.

1102
01:39:44,868 --> 01:39:46,120
<i>Pull them out of here.</i>

1103
01:39:46,245 --> 01:39:49,706
I'm sorry. Last thing I wanted to do
was let you down.

1104
01:40:16,316 --> 01:40:17,359
Pick up.

1105
01:40:19,861 --> 01:40:21,363
Neil, man. What's up?

1106
01:40:21,571 --> 01:40:22,614
What's up?

1107
01:40:22,739 --> 01:40:24,449
What are you doing here?

1108
01:40:24,741 --> 01:40:28,203
I'm looking for a driver
who can handle scanners on the radio.

1109
01:40:28,328 --> 01:40:29,621
Right now, today.

1110
01:40:29,996 --> 01:40:31,289
You remember the drill?

1111
01:40:31,414 --> 01:40:32,666
Yeah, sure.

1112
01:40:32,874 --> 01:40:34,000
You cool?

1113
01:40:34,751 --> 01:40:36,378
You know I'm cool.

1114
01:40:37,170 --> 01:40:39,548
One answer: yes or no. Right now.

1115
01:40:53,770 --> 01:40:56,564
Yeah, man. Fuck, yeah. You're on.

1116
01:40:57,941 --> 01:40:59,484
Out back in five.

1117
01:41:09,953 --> 01:41:11,329
What's burning?

1118
01:41:11,871 --> 01:41:13,081
What is this?

1119
01:41:13,581 --> 01:41:15,583
Where do you think you're going?

1120
01:42:51,887 --> 01:42:53,931
Don't move! Put your hands in the air!

1121
01:42:54,098 --> 01:42:55,140
Hands up!

1122
01:42:55,307 --> 01:42:56,934
Put them up! Now!

1123
01:42:58,310 --> 01:42:59,394
Get on your knees!

1124
01:42:59,561 --> 01:43:00,562
The keys!

1125
01:43:01,563 --> 01:43:03,023
Get on your knees!

1126
01:43:07,402 --> 01:43:08,529
Get over there!

1127
01:43:09,947 --> 01:43:11,031
Turn around!

1128
01:43:11,240 --> 01:43:12,783
Put your hands behind you!

1129
01:43:12,908 --> 01:43:13,951
Get down!

1130
01:43:14,076 --> 01:43:15,118
Stay down!

1131
01:43:16,161 --> 01:43:17,162
Get down!

1132
01:43:19,957 --> 01:43:22,376
- Down!
- The keys! The keys!

1133
01:43:27,255 --> 01:43:28,298
Stay down!

1134
01:43:29,091 --> 01:43:32,094
We want to hurt no one.
We want the bank's money, not yours.

1135
01:43:32,219 --> 01:43:35,222
Your money is insured by the government.
You won't lose a dime.

1136
01:43:35,347 --> 01:43:36,515
Think of your families.

1137
01:43:36,640 --> 01:43:39,100
Don't risk your life. Don't be a hero.

1138
01:43:39,476 --> 01:43:44,189
I want you to sit on the floor, put your
hands on your head. Anybody feels sick...

1139
01:43:44,314 --> 01:43:46,858
anybody got heart trouble,
lean against the wall.

1140
01:43:48,276 --> 01:43:49,277
The key.

1141
01:43:49,486 --> 01:43:50,737
What key?

1142
01:43:52,697 --> 01:43:54,741
Sit down and stay down!

1143
01:43:55,784 --> 01:43:58,411
Sit there. Don't move. Let it bleed.

1144
01:44:47,710 --> 01:44:49,670
Get down. Down, down, down.

1145
01:44:49,921 --> 01:44:51,380
Put your heads down!

1146
01:45:16,947 --> 01:45:19,283
You guys working a case
on a Neil McCauley?

1147
01:45:19,408 --> 01:45:22,620
This C.I., Hugh Benny,
called in about a bank.

1148
01:45:25,790 --> 01:45:28,751
Far East National Bank, 11:30!

1149
01:45:46,226 --> 01:45:48,520
I want a block at Figueroa and Fifth...

1150
01:45:48,646 --> 01:45:51,690
and I want a block
northbound Flower at Sixth.

1151
01:46:29,936 --> 01:46:31,688
They're already coming out.

1152
01:46:32,272 --> 01:46:34,316
We gotta take them in the car.

1153
01:46:34,483 --> 01:46:36,276
Wait till they are all in.

1154
01:46:36,526 --> 01:46:38,820
Get clean shots. Watch your background.

1155
01:46:48,371 --> 01:46:49,748
Police! Move!

1156
01:46:51,208 --> 01:46:52,584
Move. Move. Get down.

1157
01:47:14,731 --> 01:47:16,066
Move it. Down, down.

1158
01:47:19,569 --> 01:47:20,737
We did it!

1159
01:47:25,241 --> 01:47:26,284
Move!

1160
01:47:32,582 --> 01:47:33,791
Get down!

1161
01:47:43,343 --> 01:47:44,385
Get in the car!

1162
01:48:01,152 --> 01:48:02,361
Go! Go!

1163
01:49:03,255 --> 01:49:04,298
Go!

1164
01:49:29,197 --> 01:49:30,198
Go!

1165
01:51:11,299 --> 01:51:12,300
Come on!

1166
01:51:45,332 --> 01:51:46,625
Get down!

1167
01:51:59,763 --> 01:52:03,684
All the way down! Get down! Now!

1168
01:53:03,827 --> 01:53:05,120
Come here.

1169
01:53:50,665 --> 01:53:51,958
I got you.

1170
01:53:56,295 --> 01:54:00,675
<i>Tragedy in the neighborhood today.
A bank robbery spilled out into the street.</i>

1171
01:54:01,050 --> 01:54:04,053
<i>Claudia Newman, live on the scene.
She has the latest.</i>

1172
01:54:04,303 --> 01:54:08,266
<i>This afternoon, a neighborhood was
terrorized by a bank holdup gone wrong.</i>

1173
01:54:08,474 --> 01:54:12,186
<i>With the streets full of shoppers and kids,
police and armed robbers...</i>

1174
01:54:12,311 --> 01:54:13,729
Excuse me, bartender.

1175
01:54:13,938 --> 01:54:17,775
<i>Our top story tonight:
Robbery, pursuit and, finally, death.</i>

1176
01:54:17,900 --> 01:54:21,028
<i>A Los Angeles neighborhood is shaken
by a bank robbery...</i>

1177
01:54:21,237 --> 01:54:23,656
<i>that ended in homicide and terror.</i>

1178
01:54:23,948 --> 01:54:25,366
<i>Michael Cheritto...</i>

1179
01:54:25,491 --> 01:54:29,537
<i>one of four men involved
in the foiled robbery, died at the scene.</i>

1180
01:54:29,662 --> 01:54:30,913
<i>Also fatally wounded:</i>

1181
01:54:31,038 --> 01:54:34,333
<i>another suspect, Donald Breedan,
who died of gunshot wounds...</i>

1182
01:54:34,458 --> 01:54:38,045
<i>during the extensive gunfire
between police and suspects.</i>

1183
01:54:40,172 --> 01:54:41,632
All right, hold him.

1184
01:54:41,966 --> 01:54:43,467
It's all right.

1185
01:54:51,517 --> 01:54:52,560
So?

1186
01:54:52,685 --> 01:54:54,687
He's got blood loss and shock.

1187
01:54:54,812 --> 01:54:58,566
I'll give you quarter-grain bottles
of morphine for the pain.

1188
01:54:59,441 --> 01:55:00,568
Bottom line?

1189
01:55:01,110 --> 01:55:03,821
It's mostly tissue damage, which is good.

1190
01:55:04,280 --> 01:55:06,657
His clavicle's fractured. Can you rest?

1191
01:55:07,366 --> 01:55:08,450
Six, seven hours.

1192
01:55:08,575 --> 01:55:10,119
- That's it?
- That's it.

1193
01:55:10,536 --> 01:55:11,996
Take off your shirt.

1194
01:55:12,121 --> 01:55:13,122
What?

1195
01:55:14,623 --> 01:55:16,083
Take off your shirt.

1196
01:55:24,591 --> 01:55:25,968
My daughter gave it to me.

1197
01:55:26,093 --> 01:55:28,262
I don't give a shit. Take it off.

1198
01:55:40,649 --> 01:55:41,817
Listen to me.

1199
01:55:42,234 --> 01:55:46,196
Nate's going to pick you up.
He's going to take you to his place.

1200
01:55:47,572 --> 01:55:48,657
Where's Charlene?

1201
01:55:48,782 --> 01:55:53,161
We gotta go. We're on the 6:00 news.
We gotta get out of here.

1202
01:55:53,286 --> 01:55:55,288
I'm not going without her.

1203
01:55:55,664 --> 01:55:56,957
Think about that.

1204
01:55:57,290 --> 01:55:59,084
I will meet you at Nate's.

1205
01:55:59,334 --> 01:56:00,627
Where are you going?

1206
01:56:00,794 --> 01:56:04,548
To find out if our out got spilled
along with every other damn thing.

1207
01:56:05,048 --> 01:56:06,299
Who did it?

1208
01:56:07,676 --> 01:56:08,969
Who wasn't there?

1209
01:56:10,470 --> 01:56:11,471
Trejo.

1210
01:56:15,350 --> 01:56:16,893
See you at Nate's.

1211
01:56:25,235 --> 01:56:26,611
You still want me?

1212
01:56:27,028 --> 01:56:30,156
You come down here right now
and get me. Dominick and me.

1213
01:56:31,408 --> 01:56:32,534
<i>Okay, baby.</i>

1214
01:56:32,992 --> 01:56:34,953
<i>I'll be there in two hours.</i>

1215
01:56:36,287 --> 01:56:37,330
All right.

1216
01:56:39,374 --> 01:56:41,167
Goddamn you, Chris.

1217
01:56:41,292 --> 01:56:42,418
Goddamn you.

1218
01:56:43,419 --> 01:56:45,630
You're on a plane to Los Angeles.

1219
01:56:45,880 --> 01:56:46,923
Right.

1220
01:57:35,262 --> 01:57:37,390
Why did you do it? What happened?

1221
01:57:38,766 --> 01:57:40,309
- They made me.
- Who?

1222
01:57:40,476 --> 01:57:41,686
Where's Anna?

1223
01:57:43,104 --> 01:57:44,230
She's dead.

1224
01:57:47,191 --> 01:57:50,277
So is Michael and Breedan,
the guy who stood in for you.

1225
01:57:50,820 --> 01:57:51,946
Who did it?

1226
01:57:52,113 --> 01:57:53,114
Who did it?

1227
01:57:53,239 --> 01:57:54,949
They had Anna, man.

1228
01:57:55,115 --> 01:57:56,116
Who?

1229
01:57:57,535 --> 01:57:58,661
Waingro.

1230
01:57:59,453 --> 01:58:00,663
Waingro.

1231
01:58:01,455 --> 01:58:02,581
On his own?

1232
01:58:04,625 --> 01:58:06,335
- For someone.
- Who?

1233
01:58:07,628 --> 01:58:09,922
The other he worked for.

1234
01:58:11,131 --> 01:58:12,341
Van Zant.

1235
01:58:15,344 --> 01:58:16,637
Van Zant?

1236
01:58:20,933 --> 01:58:22,101
Are you sure?

1237
01:58:22,684 --> 01:58:23,936
Van Zant.

1238
01:58:25,729 --> 01:58:28,065
Did you tell them how we're getting out?

1239
01:58:29,191 --> 01:58:30,651
I don't think so.

1240
01:58:31,360 --> 01:58:32,528
Come on.

1241
01:58:34,404 --> 01:58:35,948
I don't remember.

1242
01:58:41,370 --> 01:58:42,496
I'll call a medic.

1243
01:58:42,621 --> 01:58:44,456
I'm not going to make it.

1244
01:58:46,750 --> 01:58:48,835
I can't feel nothing.

1245
01:58:51,088 --> 01:58:52,964
My Anna's gone.

1246
01:58:55,175 --> 01:58:56,802
She's gone.

1247
01:58:58,845 --> 01:59:00,806
Don't leave me like this.

1248
01:59:01,848 --> 01:59:03,350
Please, homes.

1249
01:59:04,476 --> 01:59:06,436
Don't leave me like this.

1250
01:59:33,380 --> 01:59:35,840
You on a cellular? Use a hard line.

1251
01:59:36,758 --> 01:59:38,009
It's a new one.

1252
01:59:39,469 --> 01:59:41,930
The guy lives on Hillside Terrace, Encino.

1253
01:59:42,305 --> 01:59:43,681
10725.

1254
01:59:44,057 --> 01:59:45,433
<i>10725.</i>

1255
01:59:45,767 --> 01:59:46,851
<i>Chris?</i>

1256
01:59:47,352 --> 01:59:49,062
He's with me, my place.

1257
01:59:49,395 --> 01:59:51,731
Next, Waingro, okay?

1258
01:59:53,566 --> 01:59:54,859
You got the time?

1259
01:59:55,860 --> 01:59:57,237
I'll make time.

1260
01:59:57,612 --> 01:59:59,364
And I need a new out.

1261
02:00:00,073 --> 02:00:01,199
Is it blown?

1262
02:00:02,992 --> 02:00:04,619
How can I trust it?

1263
02:00:07,747 --> 02:00:08,873
You got it.

1264
02:00:09,916 --> 02:00:11,376
Stay healthy.

1265
02:00:16,923 --> 02:00:18,549
Charlene Shiherlis.

1266
02:00:19,467 --> 02:00:22,386
Drucker's got a safe house in Venice
to stash her in.

1267
02:00:22,512 --> 02:00:24,013
Neil's transportation.

1268
02:00:24,138 --> 02:00:27,975
Get on the phone. Somewhere, someone's
trying to put it together for him.

1269
02:00:28,434 --> 02:00:30,811
You don't believe he already had a plan?

1270
02:00:30,937 --> 02:00:32,521
Sure. Now he needs another.

1271
02:00:32,647 --> 02:00:34,774
Would you trust yours
after this afternoon?

1272
02:00:36,442 --> 02:00:38,903
This rat motherfucker,
where did we get him?

1273
02:00:39,028 --> 02:00:42,573
He's a C.I. for a burglary cop.
Called in the tip on the bank.

1274
02:00:42,782 --> 02:00:44,367
On Neil McCauley.

1275
02:00:44,575 --> 02:00:46,035
How much time we got?

1276
02:00:46,494 --> 02:00:51,123
Eight, ten hours for him to set up
a new out. After that, he's gone, bye-bye.

1277
02:01:44,843 --> 02:01:47,596
You ratted McCauley to us!
How'd you know?

1278
02:01:47,846 --> 02:01:49,139
Who told you?

1279
02:01:49,514 --> 02:01:51,808
Who told you, rat motherfucker?

1280
02:01:52,184 --> 02:01:53,226
Who?

1281
02:02:37,896 --> 02:02:39,356
Waingro, where is he?

1282
02:02:40,398 --> 02:02:41,524
Where?

1283
02:02:41,649 --> 02:02:42,942
How would I know?

1284
02:03:08,718 --> 02:03:09,719
Well...

1285
02:03:10,303 --> 02:03:12,055
what do we have here?

1286
02:03:13,014 --> 02:03:14,182
This pretty?

1287
02:03:14,307 --> 02:03:15,391
This pretty?

1288
02:03:19,020 --> 02:03:20,480
You piece of shit.

1289
02:03:20,605 --> 02:03:23,608
Told me you wanted out from under.
You're scared, right?

1290
02:03:23,733 --> 02:03:25,485
You want out? This is out.

1291
02:03:25,610 --> 02:03:28,821
- Yeah, what's your end?
- I don't need no stupid broad.

1292
02:03:29,405 --> 02:03:30,781
How'd I get into this?

1293
02:03:30,907 --> 02:03:31,949
Easy.

1294
02:03:32,742 --> 02:03:35,077
You heard me. She had a rough ride.

1295
02:03:35,453 --> 02:03:36,579
Fix her a drink.

1296
02:03:36,704 --> 02:03:38,539
Look in the cabinet above the sink.

1297
02:03:38,664 --> 02:03:39,707
Fuck her.

1298
02:03:42,126 --> 02:03:44,754
You better get in there and stay in there.

1299
02:03:48,341 --> 02:03:49,717
Lookie here.

1300
02:03:51,260 --> 02:03:53,971
My name is Sgt. Drucker, LAPD Homicide.

1301
02:03:54,096 --> 02:03:55,890
You want to put Dominick
in the bedroom?

1302
02:03:56,015 --> 02:03:57,767
He stays with me.

1303
02:04:07,902 --> 02:04:09,278
So, what now?

1304
02:04:12,114 --> 02:04:13,199
He's right.

1305
02:04:13,324 --> 02:04:15,326
You want out? This is out.

1306
02:04:17,202 --> 02:04:19,413
You believe you have to betray Chris?

1307
02:04:19,538 --> 02:04:20,748
No shit.

1308
02:04:21,332 --> 02:04:23,709
That's right. You would have to.

1309
02:04:24,335 --> 02:04:28,172
See, if you don't betray Chris,
you victimize Dominick.

1310
02:04:29,173 --> 02:04:32,634
'Cause he'll be an orphan
when you go to prison as an accessory...

1311
02:04:32,760 --> 02:04:37,473
'cause you got no parents to take him.
So he ends up raised in foster homes...

1312
02:04:37,598 --> 02:04:39,475
juvenile facilities.

1313
02:04:39,725 --> 02:04:41,477
Then he steals a car.

1314
02:04:42,186 --> 02:04:47,065
Then he winds up in gladiator academies
like Chino and Tracy.

1315
02:04:47,691 --> 02:04:49,943
Fucked for life.

1316
02:04:51,153 --> 02:04:53,822
You know what happens,
because you've been there.

1317
02:04:55,490 --> 02:04:59,786
Dominick didn't get a chance yet
to choose his life. But Chris did.

1318
02:05:01,788 --> 02:05:04,499
If you give up Chris, you get off clean.

1319
02:05:05,500 --> 02:05:06,835
You can do it...

1320
02:05:07,210 --> 02:05:09,463
for your kid, so you can raise him.

1321
02:05:13,508 --> 02:05:14,843
What else are you selling?

1322
02:05:14,968 --> 02:05:16,344
All kinds of shit.

1323
02:05:17,846 --> 02:05:22,642
But I don't have to sell this, you know it.
This kind of shit here sells itself.

1324
02:05:29,399 --> 02:05:30,942
<i>Here's an update.</i>

1325
02:05:31,067 --> 02:05:32,611
Drucker's on Line 2.

1326
02:05:32,736 --> 02:05:34,237
<i>Hold on for a second.</i>

1327
02:05:37,115 --> 02:05:39,034
Drucker's on the other line.

1328
02:05:39,701 --> 02:05:40,910
Conference him in.

1329
02:05:42,162 --> 02:05:43,204
Go ahead.

1330
02:05:43,580 --> 02:05:45,206
Vincent, it's me.

1331
02:05:47,917 --> 02:05:50,044
One answer. What's it going to be?

1332
02:05:57,051 --> 02:05:59,554
We're set here. She'll make the call.

1333
02:05:59,679 --> 02:06:02,765
That's good. Here's the deal.

1334
02:06:03,183 --> 02:06:06,311
Hugh Benny has reformed
his wayward life...

1335
02:06:06,436 --> 02:06:08,897
and become a born-again good citizen.

1336
02:06:09,230 --> 02:06:13,443
Apparently, Neil got sold out to us
by this cowboy named Waingro.

1337
02:06:13,860 --> 02:06:18,656
Waingro used to be a part of Neil's crew,
then went to work for a money launderer:

1338
02:06:18,781 --> 02:06:20,033
<i>Van Zant.</i>

1339
02:06:20,742 --> 02:06:23,745
Units are at Van Zant's house
as we speak...

1340
02:06:23,870 --> 02:06:25,997
because he got shot dead earlier tonight.

1341
02:06:26,581 --> 02:06:29,834
<i>If Neil goes after anybody else,
it's going to be Waingro.</i>

1342
02:06:30,084 --> 02:06:33,588
Waingro just got himself a suite
at the Airport Marquis...

1343
02:06:33,713 --> 02:06:35,590
under the name Jamieson.

1344
02:06:35,840 --> 02:06:40,386
He's there now. I want you to get that
to bail bondsmen, bookies...

1345
02:06:40,511 --> 02:06:43,472
<i>assignment officers
and snitches in County.</i>

1346
02:06:43,598 --> 02:06:47,935
Anyone you can think of who'll put it
on the street. Deploy a team at the hotel...

1347
02:06:48,060 --> 02:06:50,521
<i>and personally check their coms
every 30 minutes.</i>

1348
02:06:50,646 --> 02:06:53,024
Because maybe Neil will go for him.

1349
02:06:53,316 --> 02:06:54,608
How're you feeling?

1350
02:06:55,401 --> 02:06:56,944
Banged up, but I'll live.

1351
02:07:06,162 --> 02:07:07,496
He's here.

1352
02:07:08,247 --> 02:07:09,874
Neil is still here.

1353
02:07:11,083 --> 02:07:12,543
I can feel it.

1354
02:07:13,419 --> 02:07:14,837
For how long?

1355
02:07:16,380 --> 02:07:18,299
Seven, eight hours, max.

1356
02:07:27,725 --> 02:07:29,018
What did you do?

1357
02:07:29,601 --> 02:07:30,644
That was you?

1358
02:07:31,020 --> 02:07:32,896
I don't sell metal.

1359
02:07:33,605 --> 02:07:36,650
Would have been okay, you fly out after.
Now it's jammed.

1360
02:07:36,775 --> 02:07:38,318
We gotta go together.

1361
02:07:38,819 --> 02:07:41,155
Those other people were with you?

1362
02:07:42,698 --> 02:07:44,283
My friend, Michael...

1363
02:07:46,034 --> 02:07:47,953
he knew the risks.

1364
02:07:52,499 --> 02:07:54,501
When it rains, you get wet.

1365
02:07:57,337 --> 02:07:58,881
Get packed. Let's go.

1366
02:08:18,358 --> 02:08:20,277
Why did you do this to me?

1367
02:08:31,872 --> 02:08:33,206
It'll be all right.

1368
02:08:33,331 --> 02:08:35,250
Do you understand?

1369
02:08:39,921 --> 02:08:41,673
It's going to be all right.

1370
02:08:53,143 --> 02:08:56,271
There's a Camaro at this address,
Level D, Slot 18.

1371
02:09:01,568 --> 02:09:03,027
Here's some cash.

1372
02:09:06,030 --> 02:09:07,282
When is it over?

1373
02:09:10,743 --> 02:09:12,412
Twenty-two hours from now.

1374
02:09:12,787 --> 02:09:16,749
- Then we get out of here clean.
- When will you let me leave?

1375
02:09:20,378 --> 02:09:21,379
Go now.

1376
02:09:21,504 --> 02:09:23,464
You want out? There's the door.

1377
02:09:24,090 --> 02:09:26,050
Will you let me leave later?

1378
02:09:31,222 --> 02:09:32,765
It will be different.

1379
02:09:34,434 --> 02:09:36,144
Do you even understand?

1380
02:10:07,133 --> 02:10:08,467
It's ready.

1381
02:10:16,183 --> 02:10:17,977
This is my friend Ralph.

1382
02:10:18,644 --> 02:10:20,604
You didn't tell me you were...

1383
02:10:21,480 --> 02:10:22,815
Oh, my God!

1384
02:10:23,023 --> 02:10:24,233
Where's Lauren?

1385
02:10:24,608 --> 02:10:26,360
She's at Lisa-Beth's.

1386
02:10:26,860 --> 02:10:28,988
This has nothing to do with me. I'm sorry.

1387
02:10:29,113 --> 02:10:30,197
What for?

1388
02:10:30,322 --> 02:10:31,448
Sit down.

1389
02:10:32,449 --> 02:10:33,826
Don't you get angry?

1390
02:10:34,702 --> 02:10:35,786
I'm angry.

1391
02:10:37,538 --> 02:10:39,373
I'm very angry, Ralph.

1392
02:10:40,124 --> 02:10:43,043
You can ball my wife if she wants you to.

1393
02:10:44,628 --> 02:10:48,006
You can lounge around here on her sofa.

1394
02:10:49,133 --> 02:10:50,968
In her ex-husband's...

1395
02:10:51,510 --> 02:10:54,721
dead-tech, post-modernistic,
bullshit house...

1396
02:10:54,847 --> 02:10:56,223
if you want to.

1397
02:10:58,934 --> 02:11:01,144
But you do not get to watch...

1398
02:11:01,478 --> 02:11:03,313
my fucking...

1399
02:11:03,438 --> 02:11:04,606
television set!

1400
02:11:04,731 --> 02:11:06,066
For God's sake.

1401
02:11:12,948 --> 02:11:14,741
Put the television set down.

1402
02:11:14,908 --> 02:11:17,452
- I never cheated on you, bitch.
- Maybe you should have.

1403
02:11:17,577 --> 02:11:19,663
- I should have?
- You're a party to this.

1404
02:11:19,830 --> 02:11:22,999
I made Ralph fuck you
because it makes me feel good.

1405
02:11:23,125 --> 02:11:24,751
Our situation is absurd.

1406
02:11:27,379 --> 02:11:30,173
Shut up, Ralph! Sit down!

1407
02:11:33,093 --> 02:11:36,930
Why is it that I have to figure things out
and explain them to you?

1408
02:11:37,138 --> 02:11:39,724
I say what I mean, and I do what I say.

1409
02:11:39,849 --> 02:11:41,059
How admirable.

1410
02:11:41,184 --> 02:11:43,436
- You bet.
- Except none of it's about us.

1411
02:11:44,104 --> 02:11:45,105
No.

1412
02:11:46,564 --> 02:11:49,526
I may be stoned on grass and Prozac but...

1413
02:11:50,360 --> 02:11:52,445
you walk through our life dead.

1414
02:11:53,196 --> 02:11:57,242
Now I have to demean myself with Ralph
just to get closure with you.

1415
02:12:10,296 --> 02:12:12,674
Passports, traveler's checks, plastic.

1416
02:12:13,216 --> 02:12:14,425
The plane...

1417
02:12:14,884 --> 02:12:18,346
charter terminal, LAX, Hangar 17.

1418
02:12:18,471 --> 02:12:20,098
Call letters are 1011 Sierra.

1419
02:12:23,351 --> 02:12:24,519
Touches down...

1420
02:12:24,644 --> 02:12:27,146
holds for you five minutes, then splits.

1421
02:12:27,397 --> 02:12:30,942
The plane will stand an FAA check.
Filed a flight plan, the works.

1422
02:12:32,819 --> 02:12:33,903
Where's Chris?

1423
02:12:34,237 --> 02:12:35,279
He's gone.

1424
02:12:36,656 --> 02:12:37,657
What?

1425
02:12:38,324 --> 02:12:40,827
Said he's going on his own.
Went to find Charlene.

1426
02:12:40,952 --> 02:12:43,204
- Did you bring him here?
- Yeah, I did.

1427
02:12:44,080 --> 02:12:45,123
What happened?

1428
02:12:46,249 --> 02:12:47,792
It's a free country.

1429
02:12:53,047 --> 02:12:54,840
Check in with me at 9:00...

1430
02:12:55,132 --> 02:12:56,884
everything is still cool.

1431
02:12:58,761 --> 02:12:59,887
All right.

1432
02:13:23,077 --> 02:13:25,538
I don't know what I'm doing anymore.

1433
02:13:28,874 --> 02:13:30,668
I know life is short.

1434
02:13:31,335 --> 02:13:33,379
Whatever time you get is luck.

1435
02:13:36,131 --> 02:13:37,675
You want to walk?

1436
02:13:40,552 --> 02:13:42,304
You walk right now...

1437
02:13:43,931 --> 02:13:45,516
all on your own.

1438
02:13:46,225 --> 02:13:48,852
On your own you choose to come with me.

1439
02:13:55,275 --> 02:13:56,860
All I know is...

1440
02:13:59,154 --> 02:14:02,783
there's no point in me
going anywhere anymore...

1441
02:14:03,992 --> 02:14:05,953
if it's going to be alone...

1442
02:14:07,037 --> 02:14:08,539
without you.

1443
02:15:08,598 --> 02:15:09,682
I got a live one.

1444
02:15:10,642 --> 02:15:12,018
I'll hold.

1445
02:15:14,479 --> 02:15:15,939
Show yourself.

1446
02:15:17,065 --> 02:15:19,108
- Do it.
- Shut up!

1447
02:15:22,987 --> 02:15:25,198
Now, just one second at the window...

1448
02:15:26,491 --> 02:15:28,243
and it's all over.

1449
02:17:18,268 --> 02:17:19,311
Hey, man...

1450
02:17:21,104 --> 02:17:24,358
you know any place to rent around here?

1451
02:17:27,736 --> 02:17:29,863
The grocer has got cards on the wall.

1452
02:17:42,042 --> 02:17:43,168
It's not him.

1453
02:17:43,293 --> 02:17:44,628
It's not Chris.

1454
02:17:52,802 --> 02:17:54,471
Unit 2, this is Command.

1455
02:17:54,971 --> 02:17:56,348
Take him at the street.

1456
02:17:56,473 --> 02:17:57,641
Check him out.

1457
02:18:25,293 --> 02:18:26,711
He's John Peterson.

1458
02:18:26,836 --> 02:18:28,796
<i>Valid ID. Car's registered to...</i>

1459
02:18:28,922 --> 02:18:31,341
<i>Bukowski, Gene.</i>

1460
02:18:31,674 --> 02:18:32,884
<i>Ran it to DMV.</i>

1461
02:18:33,009 --> 02:18:34,260
<i>It's clean.</i>

1462
02:18:37,180 --> 02:18:38,389
Let him go.

1463
02:18:38,848 --> 02:18:39,932
Roger.

1464
02:18:40,224 --> 02:18:42,185
Thank you. Have a good evening.

1465
02:18:44,562 --> 02:18:45,646
It's no-go.

1466
02:18:55,448 --> 02:18:58,242
Would you like a cup of coffee
while we wait?

1467
02:18:58,367 --> 02:19:00,077
Yeah, that would be nice.

1468
02:19:31,233 --> 02:19:32,568
What do you got?

1469
02:19:32,693 --> 02:19:34,111
<i>Nothing's happening.</i>

1470
02:19:47,374 --> 02:19:48,834
Hello, it's Vincent.

1471
02:19:49,460 --> 02:19:50,502
<i>What do you got?</i>

1472
02:19:50,628 --> 02:19:53,047
Nothing's going on. Waingro went for ice.

1473
02:19:53,422 --> 02:19:54,506
<i>That's it.</i>

1474
02:20:03,307 --> 02:20:04,600
You know what?

1475
02:20:07,186 --> 02:20:08,604
Neil is gone.

1476
02:20:13,734 --> 02:20:15,277
Flying like a bird.

1477
02:20:16,195 --> 02:20:17,487
How do you know?

1478
02:20:19,072 --> 02:20:20,282
We still got bait!

1479
02:20:20,407 --> 02:20:22,451
- Maybe some time!
- What do we got?

1480
02:20:22,576 --> 02:20:23,869
What do we got?

1481
02:20:24,786 --> 02:20:26,747
<i>Bon voyage, motherfucker.</i>

1482
02:20:28,248 --> 02:20:29,708
You were good.

1483
02:20:31,543 --> 02:20:33,170
I'm going to the hotel.

1484
02:20:34,463 --> 02:20:36,423
I'm going to take a shower...

1485
02:20:37,466 --> 02:20:40,302
and I'm going to sleep for a month.

1486
02:22:51,181 --> 02:22:52,224
Here.

1487
02:22:59,356 --> 02:23:00,399
Come on.

1488
02:23:09,074 --> 02:23:10,117
Shit.

1489
02:23:19,418 --> 02:23:21,128
Motherfucking waste.

1490
02:23:24,631 --> 02:23:27,593
Assholes shoot themselves all fucking day.

1491
02:23:27,718 --> 02:23:28,760
Not you, baby.

1492
02:23:28,885 --> 02:23:30,095
Not you.

1493
02:23:35,434 --> 02:23:38,395
Where would she be? Her name is Lauren.

1494
02:23:38,520 --> 02:23:41,314
Lauren Gustafson,
and she's supposed to be here.

1495
02:23:48,697 --> 02:23:50,782
I need somebody to help...

1496
02:23:56,955 --> 02:23:58,039
I got you.

1497
02:23:59,374 --> 02:24:02,460
You'll be all right, I swear. It's okay, baby.

1498
02:24:03,003 --> 02:24:04,504
Let's get a doctor!

1499
02:24:04,629 --> 02:24:06,339
Let's go! A doctor here!

1500
02:24:06,673 --> 02:24:09,050
- There's your mama.
- Let's just calm down.

1501
02:24:09,175 --> 02:24:11,303
- Is she on any drugs?
- I'm calm. No.

1502
02:24:13,847 --> 02:24:16,307
Get a trauma surgeon
and a vascular surgeon.

1503
02:24:16,725 --> 02:24:20,186
I think she cut both arteries.
I could hardly feel her pulse.

1504
02:24:20,562 --> 02:24:21,730
Her pressure's down.

1505
02:24:21,855 --> 02:24:24,065
So is her respiration.
You have to intubate her.

1506
02:24:24,190 --> 02:24:25,400
It's ready.

1507
02:24:27,068 --> 02:24:29,070
When's the last time anybody saw her?

1508
02:24:29,195 --> 02:24:30,196
I don't know.

1509
02:24:30,321 --> 02:24:31,656
Where did you find her?

1510
02:24:31,865 --> 02:24:32,991
The bathtub.

1511
02:24:34,993 --> 02:24:37,245
Give her large-bore normal saline.

1512
02:24:37,370 --> 02:24:38,788
Keep pressure on those bleeders.

1513
02:24:38,913 --> 02:24:42,250
Give me two units, O-negative.
Let's type and cross her for six.

1514
02:24:44,210 --> 02:24:47,672
Where is Respiratory? We need more help.
Get them down now.

1515
02:24:47,797 --> 02:24:50,758
Let's have X-ray ready
for post-intubation chest X-ray.

1516
02:24:57,098 --> 02:25:00,184
Your daughter's out of surgery
and she's in the recovery room.

1517
02:25:00,309 --> 02:25:01,769
Her vital signs are stable.

1518
02:25:01,936 --> 02:25:04,439
The surgeon will speak to you
in a few moments.

1519
02:25:04,564 --> 02:25:05,648
She's okay?

1520
02:25:05,773 --> 02:25:06,858
She's doing good.

1521
02:25:06,983 --> 02:25:08,484
She'll be okay.

1522
02:25:08,985 --> 02:25:10,862
She's going to be okay.

1523
02:25:11,070 --> 02:25:13,948
Oh, my baby.
Why did she do this to herself?

1524
02:25:15,408 --> 02:25:18,494
Look what she did.
Look what she did to herself.

1525
02:25:22,915 --> 02:25:25,543
It's all right. It's going to be all right.

1526
02:25:26,002 --> 02:25:28,087
I'm here. I ain't going anywhere.

1527
02:25:28,212 --> 02:25:30,965
Do you understand?
I ain't going anywhere.

1528
02:25:45,938 --> 02:25:47,022
It's me.

1529
02:25:47,481 --> 02:25:50,234
Plane's in the air now.
You're right on time.

1530
02:25:50,901 --> 02:25:52,778
I still can't find a driver...

1531
02:25:52,945 --> 02:25:54,613
<i>so that's in the trust.</i>

1532
02:25:55,030 --> 02:25:56,407
<i>One other thing...</i>

1533
02:25:57,449 --> 02:25:59,326
<i>I gotta tell you.</i>

1534
02:25:59,785 --> 02:26:03,872
The guy you want is in the Marquis
under Jamieson, if you still give a shit...

1535
02:26:04,164 --> 02:26:05,916
<i>which I figured you wouldn't.</i>

1536
02:26:06,208 --> 02:26:07,584
You figured right.

1537
02:26:08,043 --> 02:26:09,586
So, so long, brother.

1538
02:26:11,839 --> 02:26:13,298
You take it easy.

1539
02:26:14,007 --> 02:26:15,300
You're home free.

1540
02:26:17,386 --> 02:26:18,595
Take it easy.

1541
02:26:29,648 --> 02:26:30,732
What is it?

1542
02:26:31,066 --> 02:26:32,234
Nothing.

1543
02:26:32,568 --> 02:26:33,777
Home free.

1544
02:27:11,982 --> 02:27:13,858
I gotta take care of something.

1545
02:27:14,025 --> 02:27:15,277
Is there time?

1546
02:27:15,986 --> 02:27:17,153
There's time.

1547
02:27:45,932 --> 02:27:48,560
I'll be right back. Just leave her running.

1548
02:28:30,935 --> 02:28:31,936
<i>Registration.</i>

1549
02:28:32,061 --> 02:28:33,145
This is room service.

1550
02:28:33,270 --> 02:28:37,149
A Jamieson ordered a BLT, and they
screwed up his room number. What is it?

1551
02:28:37,274 --> 02:28:39,068
<i>- They're always doing that.
- I know.</i>

1552
02:28:39,193 --> 02:28:40,736
<i>1735.</i>

1553
02:28:40,861 --> 02:28:42,071
Thank you.

1554
02:30:25,799 --> 02:30:27,467
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

1555
02:30:27,592 --> 02:30:30,637
<i>We are currently experiencing a fire alarm.</i>

1556
02:30:31,221 --> 02:30:32,639
<i>Do not panic.</i>

1557
02:30:32,764 --> 02:30:34,766
<i>Do not take the elevators.</i>

1558
02:30:39,813 --> 02:30:41,231
I'm staying here.

1559
02:30:41,356 --> 02:30:44,651
I'll check the stairs.
If there's smoke, I'll pull you out.

1560
02:30:49,239 --> 02:30:51,533
What about her dad? Should I call him?

1561
02:30:52,617 --> 02:30:54,827
He's somewhere in the Sierras.

1562
02:30:56,913 --> 02:30:58,539
And she chose you.

1563
02:31:01,167 --> 02:31:02,960
She picked your place.

1564
02:31:05,171 --> 02:31:07,048
It's not right, what happened to her.

1565
02:31:07,173 --> 02:31:08,633
No, it's not.

1566
02:31:25,107 --> 02:31:26,817
Is there any way that...

1567
02:31:29,195 --> 02:31:31,239
it could work out between us?

1568
02:31:34,075 --> 02:31:36,410
I wish I could say yes, you know.

1569
02:31:36,786 --> 02:31:37,828
But...

1570
02:31:38,037 --> 02:31:39,580
in the end...

1571
02:31:44,543 --> 02:31:46,253
It's like you said:

1572
02:31:49,423 --> 02:31:50,758
All I am...

1573
02:31:51,467 --> 02:31:53,552
is what I'm going after.

1574
02:32:00,976 --> 02:32:03,145
I'm not what you want, Justine.

1575
02:32:14,281 --> 02:32:16,200
Go on, if you have to.

1576
02:32:18,994 --> 02:32:20,120
I'll stay.

1577
02:32:20,245 --> 02:32:22,289
I'm okay. I can handle this.

1578
02:32:25,334 --> 02:32:26,794
Just be careful.

1579
02:32:27,586 --> 02:32:30,214
Call me here. Let me know you're okay.

1580
02:32:31,340 --> 02:32:32,341
Okay?

1581
02:33:33,151 --> 02:33:35,487
Security. There's a fire on three.

1582
02:33:35,612 --> 02:33:37,238
We have to evacuate all floors.

1583
02:33:37,364 --> 02:33:38,990
I can't leave here.

1584
02:33:47,874 --> 02:33:50,877
Why don't we just talk
about this a bit, brother?

1585
02:34:05,183 --> 02:34:06,476
He's here on 17.

1586
02:34:09,479 --> 02:34:10,688
Look at me.

1587
02:34:10,855 --> 02:34:11,898
Look at me!

1588
02:34:15,276 --> 02:34:16,319
Look at me!

1589
02:34:48,309 --> 02:34:49,685
LAPD! Don't move!

1590
02:34:49,810 --> 02:34:51,604
Put your hands on your head!

1591
02:35:27,181 --> 02:35:29,016
Switch me to TAC 5.

1592
02:35:29,641 --> 02:35:30,851
Casals...

1593
02:35:31,185 --> 02:35:32,227
JJ...

1594
02:35:32,978 --> 02:35:34,271
Drucker, JJ...

1595
02:35:34,396 --> 02:35:36,732
<i>I'm in the lobby level by the stairwell.</i>

1596
02:35:36,857 --> 02:35:37,941
What have you got?

1597
02:35:38,066 --> 02:35:40,861
<i>Teams are moving up the other elevators
to the 17th floor.</i>

1598
02:35:40,986 --> 02:35:44,406
<i>Elevators are all out of commission
because of the fire alarm.</i>

1599
02:35:44,865 --> 02:35:46,200
Fine. 10-4.

1600
02:38:11,218 --> 02:38:12,761
Let me have that shotgun.

1601
02:44:30,928 --> 02:44:33,055
Told you I'm never going back.

1602
02:44:37,226 --> 02:44:38,268
Yeah.

1603
02:50:23,402 --> 02:50:24,403
English
