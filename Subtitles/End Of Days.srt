She was chosen
to bear his child.

<i>If she lives to bring about the End</i>
<i>of Days, there will be no redemption.</i>

<i>Okay, now give me a big push.</i>

That's it.
You're doing great.

<i>That's it. Okay, stop pushing.</i>
...five, six, seven--

<i>I have the baby's head.</i>

12
00:05:38,329 --> 00:05:40,524
Don't push yet.

13
00:05:40,598 --> 00:05:44,227
One little push oughta finish this off.
One little push.

14
00:05:46,371 --> 00:05:49,033
You have a beautiful baby girl.

15
00:05:49,107 --> 00:05:50,905
Oh!

16
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:54,707
She's so beautiful!

17
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,715
She's so beautiful!

00:05:58,851 --> 00:06:00,944
Just gonna take her
and clean her up.

19
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,920
- Not yet.
- Hospital rules.

20
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:05,014
Please. You'll have her back
before you know it.

21
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:58,241
Here she is.

22
00:07:59,347 --> 00:08:04,046
All fresh and clean.

23
00:08:04,118 --> 00:08:07,747
You thought of a name for her yet?
Christine.

24
00:08:07,822 --> 00:08:10,382
Her name is Christine.

25
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:13,758
Happy birthday, Christine.

<i>Three more nights left</i>

<i>Three more nights</i>

<i>Three more nights until the biggest
celebration in the history of this city...</i>

32
00:08:42,883 --> 00:08:44,851
<i>Where will you be?</i>

33
00:08:47,188 --> 00:08:50,248
<i>Hey, Bobby, come over here.</i>
<i>Something weird's goin' on.</i>

34
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,961
What do you got there, Charlie?
I don't know.

35
00:09:01,036 --> 00:09:03,903
Pressure's climbin' off the gauge.

36
00:09:24,995 --> 00:09:27,122
Go the other way!

37
00:10:43,699 --> 00:10:45,792
Excuse me.

38
00:11:57,678 --> 00:12:00,203
What the hell are you--

39
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,360
Mmm.

<i>You're on</i> Gotham Talk.
<i>Say something interesting.</i>

41
00:12:49,334 --> 00:12:51,598
<i>I'm trying to figure out</i>
<i>what everyone's predicting here.</i>

42
00:12:51,669 --> 00:12:55,127
<i>Is the world going to come to an end</i>
<i>at exactly 12:01 on New Year's, or--</i>

43
00:12:55,206 --> 00:12:57,800
<i>I'll tell you what.</i>
<i>You should play it safe,</i>

44
00:12:57,876 --> 00:12:59,811
<i>not quit your job just yet.</i>

45
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:01,972
<i>Tell you something else:</i>
<i>in two more nights,</i>

46
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:04,311
<i>this place is gonna see</i>
<i>the wildest party ever.</i>

47
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:07,648
<i>We're gonna be there with the first hundred
callers, we're gonna make the most noise,</i>

48
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,712
<i>and we're gonna be the craziest,</i>
<i>and if the world comes to an end,</i>

49
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:12,757
<i>what the hell,</i>
<i>we're all gonna be together!</i>

50
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:15,021
<i>And if it doesn't,</i>
<i>and I don't think it will,</i>

51
00:13:15,095 --> 00:13:17,586
<i>then we'll all have the best time</i>
<i>anybody has ever had.</i>

<i>Honey, I'm home.</i>

54
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:58,698
I was just pulling myself together.

55
00:13:58,775 --> 00:14:01,505
It's gonna take a lot more pulling.

56
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,748
<i>You are looking</i>
<i>very sharp this morning.</i>

57
00:14:05,815 --> 00:14:08,340
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

58
00:14:08,418 --> 00:14:11,547
You got about five minutes
to get ready. Here.

59
00:14:11,622 --> 00:14:13,681
There's enough caffeine in this
to kill an elephant.

60
00:14:13,757 --> 00:14:17,158
Oughta get you started.

61
00:14:18,829 --> 00:14:21,354
- So what's today?
- Transport.

62
00:14:23,467 --> 00:14:25,698
Anyone special?

63
00:14:31,009 --> 00:14:33,341
No, just some Wall Street scumbag.

64
00:14:33,411 --> 00:14:36,778
Why the hell does he need
all this protection?

65
00:14:36,848 --> 00:14:38,874
Well, I guess he fucked
with some people...

66
00:14:38,951 --> 00:14:41,784
<i>that didn't like</i>
<i>being fucked with.</i>

67
00:14:41,854 --> 00:14:46,621
Personally, I like scumbags.
They pay better.

68
00:15:08,483 --> 00:15:11,782
They say breakfast
is the most important meal of the day.

69
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:17,882
No, I'm good.
Thanks.

<i>- Okay, you zeroes.</i>

These people are paying us good money.

75
00:15:30,472 --> 00:15:33,771
Get your heads out of your asses
and start earning those paychecks.

76
00:15:33,842 --> 00:15:35,902
<i>Follow Three, give me a visual sweep.</i>

<i>Ten seconds out.</i>

00:16:21,694 --> 00:16:24,458
<i>Roger. Ten seconds.</i>

<i>Follow Three, we have arrived.</i>

<i>Sky Two,</i>
<i>fire escape, southwest corner.</i>

90
00:16:50,391 --> 00:16:52,757
Fire escape's negative.

91
00:17:08,396 --> 00:17:11,160
You're wrong! Shooter!
Evac! Evac!

92
00:17:11,232 --> 00:17:13,427
Get in the car!

93
00:17:38,628 --> 00:17:41,096
Call N.Y.P.D.!
Get me an ambulance!

94
00:17:41,164 --> 00:17:44,362
- What the hell's goin' on?
<i>- I see him! I see him!</i>

95
00:17:44,435 --> 00:17:46,767
Shit!

96
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,070
Oh, shit! Tell me
you remembered! Come on!

97
00:17:57,948 --> 00:17:59,974
Get up, you pussy.

98
00:18:02,454 --> 00:18:04,547
Where's the shooter?

99
00:18:04,623 --> 00:18:06,648
- Headed for the roof.
- So are we.

100
00:18:10,529 --> 00:18:13,624
Sky Two, get the fuck
down here, now!

101
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,598
Come on! Hurry!

00:18:36,757 --> 00:18:39,055
Take us up there!

103
00:18:53,908 --> 00:18:56,070
Move in! Move in!

104
00:19:29,046 --> 00:19:32,538
- Set us down! Hurry!
- There's too much crap on that roof!

105
00:19:32,617 --> 00:19:35,586
<i>- We'll tear off the main rotor.</i>
<i>- Then get us down as low as you can!</i>

106
00:19:35,653 --> 00:19:38,554
<i>Hurry now! Go!</i>

107
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:40,387
Strap me in!

108
00:19:43,729 --> 00:19:46,755
You're good!

109
00:20:20,034 --> 00:20:22,631
He's gonna jump off the roof! Shit!

110
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:33,239
He's got him!

111
00:20:47,296 --> 00:20:49,161
Gun! Gun!

112
00:22:14,089 --> 00:22:18,686
Oculus Dei!
<i>The thousand years has ended!</i>

113
00:22:18,761 --> 00:22:21,229
The Dark Angel is loosed
from his prison!

114
00:22:21,297 --> 00:22:24,357
Get down on the ground and
put your hands behind your head.

115
00:22:25,968 --> 00:22:27,936
You don't know
what you've done!

116
00:22:28,004 --> 00:22:31,338
- Get down, or I'll put you down!
- The thousand years has ended!

117
00:22:31,408 --> 00:22:33,740
You don't know what you've done!

118
00:23:16,356 --> 00:23:18,881
Priest that drinks.
Can't be all bad.

119
00:23:18,959 --> 00:23:21,621
I think the police
may want that at some point.

120
00:23:21,695 --> 00:23:24,163
- They call it evidence.
- I like to get a head start.

121
00:23:24,231 --> 00:23:26,745
- No reason to make it easy for them.
- Yeah.

122
00:23:26,879 --> 00:23:28,973
All right.

123
00:23:31,685 --> 00:23:34,984
Watch the lines.
<i>Go through here.</i>

124
00:23:38,925 --> 00:23:41,291
She doesn't look happy
with the statements.

125
00:23:41,361 --> 00:23:44,957
Should've just killed that son
of a bitch. Less paperwork. Yeah.

126
00:23:45,032 --> 00:23:47,796
Hey, Detective. Bobby.
Hey, Jer, it's been a while.

127
00:23:47,868 --> 00:23:51,736
Hey. How are you, Marge?
Can't complain. You?

128
00:23:51,806 --> 00:23:54,172
It's a nice day to jump out
of a helicopter.

129
00:23:54,241 --> 00:23:56,472
Well, just doing my job.

130
00:23:56,545 --> 00:23:58,536
Now, listen.
Something I gotta ask you.

131
00:23:58,613 --> 00:24:01,605
<i>Yeah, what is it?</i>
You still drinking?

132
00:24:01,683 --> 00:24:03,878
<i>Oh, yeah, we got all</i>
<i>liquored up this morning.</i>

133
00:24:03,952 --> 00:24:06,819
- We start every day that way.
- I'm just reading his statement.

134
00:24:06,888 --> 00:24:10,450
You said here the guy spoke to you.
Yeah. So what?

135
00:24:10,526 --> 00:24:13,290
The guy doesn't have a tongue.

136
00:24:13,363 --> 00:24:16,491
- What?
- He has no tongue?

137
00:24:16,566 --> 00:24:20,263
Why don't I just leave
that little detail out for now.

138
00:24:20,336 --> 00:24:23,430
No big deal, right?
<i>Are you saying that I imagined all this?</i>

139
00:24:23,506 --> 00:24:26,067
No, I'm just saying.
I saved a life today.

140
00:24:26,143 --> 00:24:28,111
What the hell did you do?
All right, let it go.

141
00:24:28,178 --> 00:24:30,476
- No, no. I know what I heard.
- All right.

142
00:24:30,547 --> 00:24:33,345
<i>Those people who don't</i>
<i>belong here, get them out of here.</i>

143
00:24:33,417 --> 00:24:35,408
Make sure this place is secure.

144
00:24:52,337 --> 00:24:56,297
A drunk hangs out in a neighborhood bar,
passes out enough times,

145
00:24:56,375 --> 00:24:59,310
people would know where he lived
from carrying him home.

146
00:24:59,378 --> 00:25:01,312
I mean, it's one thing I know.

147
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,746
Yeah, well, it's important to be
an expert at something.

148
00:25:03,816 --> 00:25:07,115
Oh, it took years of research.
This must be it.

149
00:25:17,364 --> 00:25:20,561
What do you want to bet
it's rent-controlled?

150
00:25:49,231 --> 00:25:51,393
Well, I don't think this is paint.

151
00:25:54,237 --> 00:25:56,603
A real art buff.

152
00:25:56,673 --> 00:26:00,006
I don't go for this look.
It's just too damn busy.

153
00:26:11,789 --> 00:26:14,451
Listen to this.

154
00:26:14,525 --> 00:26:16,925
"I have seen the Earth
laid to waste.

155
00:26:16,994 --> 00:26:22,262
<i>"I have seen the horror to come. Is it</i>

00:26:22,334 --> 00:26:25,132
<i>"The thousand years have ended.</i>

157

Twenty... seven."

158
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,768
<i>It ends in a football score.</i>
<i>That's nice.</i>

159
00:26:36,482 --> 00:26:38,382
<i>Hey, I found something.</i>

160
00:26:38,451 --> 00:26:42,080
Can you see what it is?

161
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:49,822
His tongue.

162
00:26:51,131 --> 00:26:54,328
<i>He must have</i>
<i>cut it out himself.</i>

163
00:26:54,401 --> 00:26:59,634
Okay. And why is it someone would
cut out their own tongue?

164
00:26:59,706 --> 00:27:02,938
To keep from talking.
Right.

165
00:27:07,115 --> 00:27:09,583
Well, I could eat.

166
00:27:09,651 --> 00:27:11,983
Ah!

167
00:27:12,053 --> 00:27:14,749
- Shit!
- What?

168
00:27:16,191 --> 00:27:18,625
All right, I knew
that was gonna happen.

169
00:27:18,694 --> 00:27:21,185
No, it's all right.

170
00:27:21,263 --> 00:27:23,254
There's something in here.

171
00:27:30,105 --> 00:27:32,301
Have you ever seen her before?
Nah.

172
00:28:03,942 --> 00:28:06,672
<i>This guy</i>
<i>is no ordinary hit man.</i>

173
00:28:06,745 --> 00:28:08,804
No, this one's extraordinary.

174
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,747
Let's get the hell outta here.
This place is making me itch.

175
00:28:11,817 --> 00:28:15,982
- Drop it! Don't move! Freeze!
- Don't move! Freeze!

176
00:28:17,457 --> 00:28:19,584
Oh. It's us.

177
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,020
<i>Jesus! How the hell</i>
<i>did you two find this place?</i>

178
00:28:24,097 --> 00:28:27,191
Lucky guess.
So what did you find out?

179
00:28:27,267 --> 00:28:29,861
His name's Thomas Aquinas.
He's a priest.

180
00:28:29,937 --> 00:28:31,996
Why don't you tell us
something we don't know?

181
00:28:32,072 --> 00:28:35,564
- A homicidal priest. That's good.
- Yeah? Well, it gets better.

182
00:28:35,643 --> 00:28:38,840
He studied at the Vatican.
He was one of their alleged visionaries.

183
00:28:38,912 --> 00:28:41,746
Came here in '81
to St. John's Church downtown.

184
00:28:41,816 --> 00:28:44,580
<i>Six months ago, he disappeared.</i>

185
00:28:44,653 --> 00:28:47,121
Priests there say he was
having a spiritual crisis.

186
00:28:47,188 --> 00:28:49,588
Oh, yeah.
That's what this is about.

187
00:28:49,658 --> 00:28:52,855
Spiritual crisis.
Doesn't make any sense.

188
00:28:52,927 --> 00:28:55,691
<i>What's a priest doing shooting</i>
<i>at a Wall Street banker?</i>

189
00:28:55,764 --> 00:28:59,724
<i>A Wall Street banker,</i>
<i>by the way, who suddenly disappeared.</i>

190
00:28:59,802 --> 00:29:01,702
Maybe we should ask the girl.

191
00:29:01,771 --> 00:29:04,069
What girl?

192
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:07,598
Uh, the guy. The guy. Priest guy.

193
00:29:11,014 --> 00:29:13,209
There's five million women
living in New York City.

194
00:29:13,283 --> 00:29:15,195
How we gonna find her
without a name?

195
00:30:00,777 --> 00:30:02,711
Here.

196
00:30:08,286 --> 00:30:11,255
Look, I already gave you some money.
Can you just move on, please?

197
00:30:11,322 --> 00:30:14,951
He's comin' for you.
He's comin' for you, Christine.

198
00:30:15,026 --> 00:30:17,119
How do you know my name?

199
00:30:17,195 --> 00:30:20,995
He's gonna fuck you. He's gonna
fuck you, Christine. Can you see him?

200
00:30:21,065 --> 00:30:23,298
- Can you see him?
- Who are you?

201
00:30:23,368 --> 00:30:25,598
<i>How do you know my name?</i>

202
00:30:31,176 --> 00:30:34,009
He's gonna fuck you, Christine.

203
00:30:47,994 --> 00:30:51,761
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

204
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:37,613
Ohh.

205
00:31:53,498 --> 00:31:56,194
The thousand years have ended.

206
00:31:56,267 --> 00:31:59,430
Thousand years have ended.

207
00:32:59,969 --> 00:33:02,699
"When the thousand years are ended,

208
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:06,037
Satan shall be loosed
out of his prison."

209
00:33:07,543 --> 00:33:10,579
<i>"Twenty... seven. "</i>

210
00:33:22,626 --> 00:33:24,560
<i>Christine?</i>

211
00:33:26,863 --> 00:33:29,389
<i>Christine?</i>
I'll be there in a sec!

212
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:46,884
Doctor's office.

213
00:33:46,952 --> 00:33:48,920
Hello.
Is Dr. Abel in, please?

214
00:33:48,987 --> 00:33:50,921
Who's calling, please?
It's Christine York.

215
00:33:50,989 --> 00:33:54,425
<i>Christine, listen to me.</i>
<i>We've been over this before.</i>

216
00:33:54,493 --> 00:33:59,158
It's a terrible thing to lose your
parents. I know it was a long time ago.

217
00:33:59,232 --> 00:34:02,793
The holidays always make something
like that feel much worse.

218
00:34:02,869 --> 00:34:08,239
Understand, these dreams are your
creation. There's nothing real about them.

219
00:34:09,742 --> 00:34:13,304
You control them.
They don't control you.

220
00:34:15,082 --> 00:34:17,550
Take another Xanax
to relieve your anxiety.

221
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:21,654
You are fine. Trust me.

222
00:34:24,091 --> 00:34:27,619
Another vision?
Why didn't you tell me?

223
00:34:27,696 --> 00:34:31,860
I didn't want you to worry. <i>I'm your</i>
<i>stepmother. It's my job to worry.</i>

224
00:34:31,933 --> 00:34:33,867
No big deal, really.

225
00:34:33,935 --> 00:34:37,735
<i>Just someone on the subway car</i>
<i>turned into porcelain and shattered.</i>

226
00:34:37,806 --> 00:34:41,334
<i>What's wrong with me? Why do I see</i>
<i>things? Why am I so different?</i>

227
00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:45,676
Oh, you don't know how special you are.

228
00:34:45,748 --> 00:34:49,047
You're better than everybody else.
Just remember that.

229
00:34:49,118 --> 00:34:52,053
I don't want to be better or worse.
I want to be normal.

230
00:34:52,121 --> 00:34:55,853
I want a normal life.
You have to have patience.

231
00:34:55,926 --> 00:34:58,360
All good things will come
to you. You'll see.

232
00:35:06,515 --> 00:35:09,974
Oh, excuse me.
I'm sorry, we're closed.

233
00:35:10,053 --> 00:35:13,318
I would like to talk to you
about Thomas Aquinas.

234
00:35:13,389 --> 00:35:15,550
Father, please, I need you downstairs.
Just take these.

235
00:35:15,625 --> 00:35:17,559
Father, please.
Go.

236
00:35:20,697 --> 00:35:24,293
I've already told the police. Thomas
was a friend of mine and a colleague.

237
00:35:24,368 --> 00:35:27,303
He had nothing to do
with what happened today.

238
00:35:27,371 --> 00:35:29,339
There was no one else
on that fire escape.

239
00:35:29,406 --> 00:35:33,365
You don't understand. I understand
getting shot at, and I don't like it.

240
00:35:33,444 --> 00:35:36,312
He shot at you?
No, he shot at my client.

241
00:35:36,381 --> 00:35:39,578
- I happened to get in the way.
- Who's your client?

242
00:35:39,651 --> 00:35:40,905
That's irrelevant right now.

243
00:35:40,931 --> 00:35:43,840
What I want to know is why would
a priest try to kill someone?

244
00:35:43,888 --> 00:35:48,222
You've been drinking. I've got 14
years sober, and I can spot that.

245
00:35:48,293 --> 00:35:52,253
Well, good for you. Your friend and
colleague, was he working for someone?

246
00:35:52,331 --> 00:35:54,356
Yes, he was working for God.

247
00:35:54,433 --> 00:35:57,163
So God ordered a hit
on an investment banker?

248
00:35:57,236 --> 00:36:00,103
There's a lot that you don't know.
You think you've seen everything?

249
00:36:00,172 --> 00:36:02,367
You haven't. There are
things you never dreamed of.

250
00:36:02,441 --> 00:36:06,401
There's another world out there.
Thomas saw it, and it destroyed him.

251
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,610
I've seen a lot too, but there's nothing
that would make me cut my tongue out.

252
00:36:10,684 --> 00:36:14,415
Yeah, well, wait a few days.
What happens in a few days?

253
00:36:14,488 --> 00:36:16,922
<i>Did Thomas tell you</i>
<i>about a girl?</i>

254
00:36:19,294 --> 00:36:22,320
- No.
- I see. Do you believe in God?

255
00:36:25,166 --> 00:36:28,397
Maybe once, but not anymore.

256
00:36:28,469 --> 00:36:30,596
What happened?

257
00:36:30,672 --> 00:36:33,164
We had a difference of opinion.

258
00:36:33,242 --> 00:36:37,702
I thought that my wife and daughter
should live, and He felt otherwise.

259
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:42,183
I'm sorry to hear about the loss. Maybe
it's time for you to renew your faith.

260
00:36:43,886 --> 00:36:46,081
This girl.

261
00:36:46,155 --> 00:36:48,454
Is she in trouble?
Does she need help?

262
00:36:48,525 --> 00:36:51,494
I have a lot of things to do here.
Excuse me. Excuse me.

263
00:36:51,561 --> 00:36:54,462
I have more questions, if you don't mind.
I've got a question for you.

264
00:36:54,531 --> 00:36:57,398
If you don't believe in God,
how can you understand his adversary?

265
00:36:57,467 --> 00:37:01,871
Now I have to believe in God
in order to solve a crime?

266
00:37:01,939 --> 00:37:05,102
I'm sure that you can
find your way out.

267
00:37:42,949 --> 00:37:45,680
- How many have received the stigmata?
- She's the third this week.

268
00:37:50,758 --> 00:37:55,058
<i>What is she saying?</i> For your own good,
get out and forget what you've seen!

269
00:37:55,129 --> 00:37:59,396
Was Thomas part of this? There are forces
at work you couldn't possibly comprehend!

270
00:37:59,467 --> 00:38:02,163

275
00:39:10,108 --> 00:39:12,134

blood on the hands of the Christ child,</i>

303
00:41:44,107 --> 00:41:46,598
<i>depicted in Michelangelo's</i>
<i>famous sculpture of the</i> Pieta--

304
00:41:46,676 --> 00:41:49,111
<i>...atmosphere of fear</i>
<i>and panic, random acts of violence...</i>

305
00:41:49,179 --> 00:41:51,943
<i>are being attributed to satanic cults</i>
<i>who seem determined...</i>

306
00:41:52,016 --> 00:41:53,950
<i>to disrupt New Year's celebrations</i>
<i>throughout the world.</i>

307
00:41:54,018 --> 00:41:55,391
<i>Here in New York--</i>

308
00:42:11,675 --> 00:42:14,872
Sorry, pal, you can't come in here.

309
00:42:14,945 --> 00:42:19,781
Ahh. The young boys that you seduced
have left their scent upon you.

310
00:42:22,387 --> 00:42:25,584
Remember who it is that you serve.
Hmm?

311
00:42:44,544 --> 00:42:46,876
<i>Open your eyes, Thomas.</i>

312
00:42:57,090 --> 00:43:01,926
Look. Look at the face that has haunted
your dreams for a thousand years.

313
00:43:19,515 --> 00:43:21,847
They say you can see the future, Thomas.

314
00:43:23,986 --> 00:43:28,447
Then you must know exactly
what I'm going to do to you.

315
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,954
<i>I don't know what we hope</i>
<i>to get from this guy.</i>

316
00:43:33,029 --> 00:43:34,997
He's got no fuckin' tongue.
He can write.

317
00:44:04,629 --> 00:44:06,392
Fuck me.

318
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:10,399
<i>There is still no explanation...</i>

319
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:14,406
<i>for the devastating explosions</i>
<i>that rocked midtown two nights ago.</i>

320
00:44:14,474 --> 00:44:16,601
In the wake
of Tuesday night's explosion,

321
00:44:16,676 --> 00:44:21,477
investigators from the New York City Fire
Department are still at a loss to explain...

322
00:44:21,547 --> 00:44:26,076
<i>why the restaurant suddenly burst</i>
<i>into flames, killing at least 35 people.</i>

323
00:44:26,153 --> 00:44:29,884
- Hey, asshole, watch where you're going.
- Hey, I like the shirt.

324
00:44:29,957 --> 00:44:31,424
Screw you, man!

325
00:44:36,430 --> 00:44:38,489
Hey, kid.

326
00:44:41,436 --> 00:44:44,928
Nice shirt.

327
00:45:36,328 --> 00:45:39,263
<i>I'm tellin' you, no one entered the room.</i>
<i>Maybe he did it himself.</i>

328
00:45:39,331 --> 00:45:41,299
Then how did he get the last scalpel in!

329
00:45:41,366 --> 00:45:43,231
Oh, my God.

330
00:45:43,302 --> 00:45:47,398
- It just keeps getting better.
- I've never seen anything like this.

331
00:45:50,877 --> 00:45:54,677
<i>I think this</i>
<i>is written in Latin.</i>

332
00:45:54,747 --> 00:45:58,649
"When the thousand years has ended,

333
00:45:58,718 --> 00:46:04,350
Satan shall be loosed out of his prison."

334
00:46:04,424 --> 00:46:08,486
Uh, this next part is not clear. I-I-I
think it's in English.

335
00:46:08,562 --> 00:46:10,792
<i>It says, "Christ--</i>

336
00:46:10,864 --> 00:46:14,265
Christ in New York."

337
00:46:20,108 --> 00:46:22,542
Christ!

338
00:46:26,715 --> 00:46:31,448
Well, it's official. I'm never
sleeping again, ever. You okay?

339
00:46:33,189 --> 00:46:37,819
A guy cuts words into his chest.
Someone else nails him to the ceiling.

340
00:46:37,893 --> 00:46:40,361
What's not okay?

341
00:46:40,429 --> 00:46:42,590
So where we going?

342
00:46:42,665 --> 00:46:46,123
The girl. I gotta talk to her,
find out what she knows.

343
00:46:46,202 --> 00:46:48,171
W-W-Wait. We don't have a name.
That would help.

344
00:46:48,238 --> 00:46:52,766
Maybe we do.
Maybe it's not "Christ in New York."

345
00:46:52,843 --> 00:46:56,574
Maybe it's, "Chris in New York,"
"Christine in New York."

346
00:46:56,647 --> 00:47:02,143
"Christine York." Let's run a D.M.V. check
and find out if any of those names come up.

347
00:47:07,458 --> 00:47:09,426
<i>Hello, Christine York.</i>

348
00:47:09,494 --> 00:47:11,428
Sometimes you border on competent.

349
00:47:11,496 --> 00:47:15,160
- I know. It's scary, isn't it?

350
00:47:22,235 --> 00:47:24,795
<i>Christine?</i>

351
00:47:24,871 --> 00:47:27,635
Mabel called. She'd like you
to get dressed and join her for lunch.

352
00:47:27,707 --> 00:47:29,641
<i>Grazie,</i> Carson.

353
00:48:04,747 --> 00:48:07,511
No!

354
00:48:22,366 --> 00:48:24,425
Shit!

355
00:49:03,844 --> 00:49:05,641
No! No!

356
00:49:07,914 --> 00:49:10,007
Ahhh! Goddamn it, get off me!

357
00:49:10,083 --> 00:49:12,143
Go downstairs and watch the front door!
<i>Please!</i>

358
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:15,087
Help!
There is no sanctuary but heaven.

359
00:49:15,156 --> 00:49:17,454
You must go there now.

360
00:49:17,525 --> 00:49:20,517
What are you doing? I commend you
to Almighty God and entrust you--

361
00:49:20,595 --> 00:49:22,859
<i>At what point is this considered...</i>

362
00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:25,695
interfering with
a police investigation?

363
00:49:25,767 --> 00:49:29,794
Hey, we are private citizens having
a conversation with another citizen.

364
00:49:29,872 --> 00:49:33,831
I mean, I don't think they've found
a way to outlaw that. At least not yet.

365
00:49:35,043 --> 00:49:37,671
<i>Please! No!</i>

366
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:43,481
May you return to Him who formed--

367
00:49:51,761 --> 00:49:55,391
Go down there. Do whatever you can.
I need more time to finish the last rites.

368
00:49:55,466 --> 00:49:57,366
May Christ, the true shepherd--

369
00:49:57,434 --> 00:49:59,402
<i>Help!</i>
Stairs.

370
00:49:59,470 --> 00:50:01,404
Covered.

371
00:50:04,308 --> 00:50:05,707
<i>Help!</i>

372
00:50:11,116 --> 00:50:12,811
May you see your redeemer--

373
00:50:18,924 --> 00:50:21,415
...forever, amen.

374
00:51:01,803 --> 00:51:03,794
Son of a bitch!

375
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:28,925
You all right?

376
00:51:28,999 --> 00:51:31,661
Yeah.
Check the body down the stairs.

377
00:51:31,735 --> 00:51:33,431
What body?

378
00:51:35,706 --> 00:51:38,766
Call the police, and get an ambulance.

379
00:51:42,046 --> 00:51:44,640
Take it easy. We're the good guys.

380
00:51:44,715 --> 00:51:47,206
<i>All right?</i>
<i>What happened?</i>

381
00:51:48,787 --> 00:51:52,951
Carson.
Those men-- Th-Those men--

382
00:51:53,025 --> 00:51:55,323
They tried to kill me.

383
00:51:55,394 --> 00:51:57,828
Why?

384
00:51:57,896 --> 00:52:01,731
<i>Eight jets, variable speed.</i>
<i>That's what I call dying in style.</i>

385
00:52:01,801 --> 00:52:03,928
What kind of girl lives in a house
like this, anyway?

386
00:52:04,003 --> 00:52:06,028
Oh, she's an orphan.
Both parents deceased.

387
00:52:06,105 --> 00:52:09,097
After the mother died, the home nurse
married the father.

388
00:52:09,175 --> 00:52:11,234
Now the nurse is the sole guardian.

389
00:52:11,310 --> 00:52:14,006
I think it's adorable the way you talk
like a real cop.

390
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:16,777
Yeah? So you think after they clean up
this mess, we could...

391
00:52:16,850 --> 00:52:19,114
Don't tempt me.
<i>soak a little?</i>

392
00:52:48,317 --> 00:52:51,980
They relax me. You want one?
Oh, no, thanks. I drink.

393
00:52:53,222 --> 00:52:56,521
My little girl had one just like it.
Really?

394
00:52:56,592 --> 00:53:00,723
Mm-hmm. Yeah? You snoop through
her stuff without asking too?

395
00:53:00,797 --> 00:53:03,027
When I was looking for something.

396
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:05,625
What are you looking for?

397
00:53:05,702 --> 00:53:07,636
A connection.

398
00:53:07,704 --> 00:53:10,832
Most days, I don't feel
connected to anyone.

399
00:53:10,907 --> 00:53:14,207
I noticed
a lot of religious books outside.

400
00:53:14,278 --> 00:53:16,405
Mm.
They're my stepmother's.

401
00:53:16,481 --> 00:53:19,279
- Is she a big believer?
- No, not really.

402
00:53:19,350 --> 00:53:21,875
It's mostly just kind of
like a hobby with her.

403
00:53:21,953 --> 00:53:25,218
Do you know a priest by the name
of Thomas Aquinas?

404
00:53:25,289 --> 00:53:28,123
No.
Is that your connection, religion?

405
00:53:28,193 --> 00:53:30,184
I've seen a lot of attempted murders,

406
00:53:30,262 --> 00:53:32,890
but I've never seen anyone
perform the last rites before.

407
00:53:32,965 --> 00:53:34,899
<i>Christine?</i>
In here!

408
00:53:36,401 --> 00:53:39,928
Are you all right? Oh, my God,
I just heard what happened!

409
00:53:40,005 --> 00:53:41,940
Did they hurt you?

410
00:53:42,008 --> 00:53:44,101
I'm okay, but Carson--

411
00:53:44,177 --> 00:53:46,839
I know. Oh.

412
00:53:48,281 --> 00:53:51,114
I'm just so glad you came along
when you did.

413
00:53:51,184 --> 00:53:53,225
Thanks.

414
00:54:18,553 --> 00:54:22,489
I didn't realize you knew where
the library was, let alone had a card.

415
00:54:23,925 --> 00:54:26,224
Well, there's a lot
about me you don't know.

416
00:54:30,232 --> 00:54:32,097
<i>They're right outside.</i>

417
00:54:32,167 --> 00:54:34,761
<i>You must</i>
<i>bring her. He is waiting for her.</i>

418
00:54:34,837 --> 00:54:37,931
No, that's impossible!
They'll follow me and find the temple!

419
00:54:40,910 --> 00:54:42,844
I couldn't convince her
to come here.

420
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:52,414
Yuck!
Then I shall have to go to her.

421
00:54:52,488 --> 00:54:54,582
<i>Did I mention</i>
<i>I had a date tonight?</i>

422
00:54:54,658 --> 00:54:56,853
Not just the inflatable kind.
A real live girl.

423
00:54:56,927 --> 00:54:59,122
Did you break up
with the inflatable one?

424
00:54:59,196 --> 00:55:03,189
Yeah. She was just too needy.

425
00:55:03,267 --> 00:55:05,861
Everything was about her.

426
00:55:05,936 --> 00:55:08,633
It's just that this is starting
to feel a lot like work.

427
00:55:08,707 --> 00:55:12,473
<i>Normally, I wouldn't mind work</i>
<i>because, well, you know,</i>

428
00:55:12,544 --> 00:55:14,603
<i>we'd be getting paid.</i>

429
00:55:14,679 --> 00:55:17,705
Watching rich people for free.
It just seems odd, doesn't it?

430
00:55:21,152 --> 00:55:23,485
Okay, I'll wait here.

431
00:55:31,764 --> 00:55:34,562
- Change your mind about the pill?
- I found something.

432
00:55:37,237 --> 00:55:40,468
Christine, what are you doing?
Why is that man here?

433
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:42,474
I'll be five minutes.

434
00:55:42,542 --> 00:55:46,000
<i>She loves me to death, but she's</i>
<i>a little overprotective.</i>

435
00:56:10,172 --> 00:56:12,663
I took this from one
of your attackers.

436
00:56:12,741 --> 00:56:15,266
Did you show that to the police?
No.

437
00:56:15,344 --> 00:56:19,338
If I did, it would end up in a plastic
envelope on one of their large shelves.

438
00:56:19,416 --> 00:56:23,352
That's pretty cynical. Well,
I've put a few of those envelopes...

439
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:25,888
up on that large shelf myself.

440
00:56:25,956 --> 00:56:28,720
I used to be a cop.

441
00:56:28,792 --> 00:56:31,124
Now, this amulet
is from a Masonic order...

442
00:56:31,194 --> 00:56:34,426
in a former sub-herald
of the Vatican knights.

443
00:56:34,498 --> 00:56:36,625
<i>The Knights</i>
<i>of the Holy See.</i>

444
00:56:36,701 --> 00:56:39,864
<i>They await the return</i>
<i>of the Dark Angel to Earth.</i>

445
00:56:39,937 --> 00:56:43,464
So, the men that attacked me
are devil worshippers?

446
00:56:43,541 --> 00:56:46,772
No. This says
they're the good guys.

447
00:56:46,844 --> 00:56:49,939
They're the ones that are supposed
to stop the devil worshippers.

448
00:56:50,015 --> 00:56:53,281
Those were the good guys?
What does that have to do with me?

449
00:57:03,429 --> 00:57:07,388
I'm sorry.
I have a medical condition.

450
00:57:07,467 --> 00:57:11,961
Sometimes I see things that aren't
there. No. I saw it too.

451
00:57:40,101 --> 00:57:42,092
I've been having visions
ever since I can remember,

452
00:57:42,170 --> 00:57:44,662
but I've never shared one before.

453
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:46,674
There must be an explanation.

454
00:57:46,742 --> 00:57:49,142
I hope so. I've been waiting
all my life to hear it.

455
00:58:49,742 --> 00:58:52,210
Let's get out of here!
Come on!

456
00:58:52,278 --> 00:58:53,905
You're not going anywhere.

457
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:56,279
- What are you doing?
- There's no time to discuss this.

458
00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:01,950
<i>After all these years of waiting, it's</i>
<i>finally happening.</i> What's happening?

459
00:59:02,022 --> 00:59:03,887
<i>You can't run away now!</i>

460
00:59:06,393 --> 00:59:09,123
<i>Stop it!</i>
Let her go! No!

461
00:59:19,441 --> 00:59:21,966
Don't you love me?

462
00:59:22,043 --> 00:59:24,034
Didn't I give you everything?

463
00:59:24,112 --> 00:59:27,776
Haven't I been a mother to you?

464
00:59:47,604 --> 00:59:49,595
No-o-o!

465
01:00:04,002 --> 01:00:07,632
- Christine. You know who I am.
- Oh, no.

466
01:00:07,707 --> 01:00:10,471
- I've come for you.
- Let's go. Come on.

467
01:00:27,494 --> 01:00:31,624
You only had one simple job,
and you couldn't even do that.

468
01:00:46,881 --> 01:00:50,818
Hey, Marge? Marge, over here!
We need your help!

469
01:00:50,886 --> 01:00:52,854
Easy with the hardware.

470
01:00:55,624 --> 01:00:58,787
Jesus, Marge!
What the fuck?

471
01:00:58,861 --> 01:01:01,352
<i>It's okay, Jer.</i>
<i>We just want the girl.</i>

472
01:01:01,430 --> 01:01:04,889
Okay, tell me. What the hell
is going on here? I don't know.

473
01:01:04,968 --> 01:01:07,300
I don't believe you.

474
01:01:07,370 --> 01:01:10,237
- All right. I'm coming out.
- Throw out the gun.

475
01:01:10,307 --> 01:01:14,038
Please don't don't
leave me here. Please!

476
01:01:19,984 --> 01:01:21,383
<i>Hands on your head.</i>

477
01:01:21,452 --> 01:01:24,751
What?
<i>Hands on your head. Now!</i>

478
01:01:33,465 --> 01:01:35,558
What do you want with her, Marge?
Huh?

479
01:01:35,634 --> 01:01:40,162
<i>- Why is she so important?</i>
- Just the girl. You can kill him.

480
01:01:54,454 --> 01:01:56,649
Come on!
Quickly!

481
01:02:14,575 --> 01:02:17,511
<i>You, I don't need.</i>

482
01:02:17,579 --> 01:02:20,548
But you--

483
01:02:20,615 --> 01:02:23,448
Call your people.
Find them.

484
01:02:38,935 --> 01:02:41,665
Over here.

485
01:02:45,976 --> 01:02:48,877
Goddamn it!

486
01:02:48,946 --> 01:02:52,507
Get up!
Come on. Get up!

487
01:02:52,583 --> 01:02:56,576
My best friend is dead. Everyone is
trying to kill us. I just shot two cops.

488
01:02:56,653 --> 01:02:59,384
Why is everyone after you?
I don't know.

489
01:02:59,457 --> 01:03:01,550
I swear. I don't know.
Why is this happening?

490
01:03:01,626 --> 01:03:04,993
<i>I know it's my fault.</i>
<i>I just don't know why.</i>

491
01:03:06,965 --> 01:03:10,264
<i>That man on the stairs,</i>
<i>what do you know about him?</i>

492
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:12,826
Nothing.
Come on. I saw your face.

493
01:03:12,904 --> 01:03:15,430
You recognized him.
I don't talk about it.

494
01:03:15,507 --> 01:03:18,271
Tell me.
I need to know.

495
01:03:22,648 --> 01:03:27,108
I've seen him before...
in my dreams.

496
01:03:27,186 --> 01:03:31,783
- In your dreams?
- They're-- They're nightmares really.

497
01:03:31,858 --> 01:03:35,794
He takes me, and--
and he makes love to me.

498
01:03:35,862 --> 01:03:38,456
I've been making love
to him my whole life.

499
01:03:38,531 --> 01:03:42,400
I thought I was crazy, but he was
never real before tonight.

500
01:03:42,470 --> 01:03:45,030
Oh, he's real.
I've seen him before.

501
01:03:45,106 --> 01:03:49,736
I'm afraid. Don't be afraid.
I won't let him do any harm to you.

502
01:03:49,810 --> 01:03:54,747
I'm afraid of me. I'm afraid that
if I see him, if he tries to take me,

503
01:03:54,815 --> 01:03:57,580
I'm gonna want him to.

504
01:03:57,653 --> 01:04:01,145
Let's go!

505
01:04:01,223 --> 01:04:03,847
Where we going?
To get some answers.

506
01:04:14,392 --> 01:04:17,225
You don't need that.
You have no enemies here.

507
01:04:17,295 --> 01:04:20,924
I'm not so sure about that. This
girl was just attacked by your people.

508
01:04:20,999 --> 01:04:24,902
Your Vatican knights almost killed her!
Vatican knights?

509
01:04:24,970 --> 01:04:26,904
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

510
01:04:26,972 --> 01:04:30,032
Well, they're not my people.
They think they're doing God's work.

511
01:04:30,109 --> 01:04:32,270
- But they're not.
- I want to know what's going on,

512
01:04:32,344 --> 01:04:34,744
and I want to know right now!
Put the gun away.

513
01:04:34,814 --> 01:04:37,578
Did anybody see you come?

514
01:04:37,650 --> 01:04:41,348
No.
Good. We should be safe here.

515
01:04:41,421 --> 01:04:46,916
According to the Scriptures, he can't
see inside of the house of God.

516
01:04:46,993 --> 01:04:49,723
Who can't?
Maybe now you're ready to believe.

517
01:05:08,183 --> 01:05:11,084
Her hands are healed.
That's the power of faith.

518
01:05:11,153 --> 01:05:13,451
- Who is she?
- She's a Polish peasant.

519
01:05:13,522 --> 01:05:15,615
<i>She fell into a trance</i>
<i>about two weeks ago,</i>

520
01:05:15,691 --> 01:05:18,751
and then she began to speak in a language
she couldn't possibly have known.

521
01:05:18,827 --> 01:05:23,492
<i>She made a prophecy about End of Days.</i>
"End of Days"?

522
01:05:23,566 --> 01:05:26,592
Of man's destruction and
the unholy's reign upon the earth.

523
01:05:26,669 --> 01:05:30,002
Why don't you stop all this church talk
and tell us what the hell is going on.

524
01:05:30,073 --> 01:05:35,010
Who's after her? Well, if you'll
excuse me, I'll try to explain.

525
01:05:35,078 --> 01:05:37,775
<i>You know anything about</i>
<i>the number of the beast?</i>

526
01:05:37,848 --> 01:05:40,646
Revelation of St. John?
From his dream?

527
01:05:40,718 --> 01:05:44,711
Six-six-six? The number of the beast
is not six-six-six.

528
01:05:44,788 --> 01:05:49,088
Often in dreams, numbers appear
upside down and backwards.

529
01:05:49,159 --> 01:05:53,426
So, six-six-six becomes nine-nine-nine.

530
01:05:53,498 --> 01:05:56,399
Like in 1999, the year of his return.

531
01:05:56,468 --> 01:05:58,698
What does that have to do with me?

532
01:06:00,005 --> 01:06:03,372
Regressus diaboli:
<i>The return of Satan.</i>

533
01:06:03,441 --> 01:06:06,570
Does any of this
look familiar to you?

534
01:06:17,223 --> 01:06:22,025
She's been chosen.
He's in her blood.

535
01:06:22,095 --> 01:06:26,225
<i>The Holy Church has been searching</i>
<i>for you since the day you were born.</i>

536
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:29,326
Chosen for what? <i>Every thousand years,</i>
<i>on the eve of the millennium,</i>

537
01:06:29,403 --> 01:06:31,530
the Dark Angel comes and takes a body,

538
01:06:31,605 --> 01:06:36,009
and then he walks the Earth, looking for
a woman who will bear his child.

539
01:06:36,077 --> 01:06:39,945
<i>It all has to happen in that unholy hour</i>
<i>before midnight on New Year's Eve.</i>

540
01:06:40,014 --> 01:06:43,711
<i>If he consummates</i>
<i>your flesh with this human body,</i>

541
01:06:43,785 --> 01:06:46,583
then he unlocks the gate of hell...

542
01:06:46,654 --> 01:06:50,591
<i>and everything as we know it</i>
<i>ceases to exist.</i>

543
01:06:50,659 --> 01:06:53,685
<i>So, the Prince of Darkness</i>
<i>wants to conquer the Earth,</i>

544
01:06:53,762 --> 01:06:56,890
<i>but has to wait until an hour</i>
<i>before midnight of New Year's Eve?</i>

545
01:06:56,966 --> 01:07:00,402
Is this Eastern time? It's got
nothing to do with New Year's Eve.

546
01:07:00,469 --> 01:07:03,462
It has to do with a temporary
celestial alignment.

547
01:07:03,540 --> 01:07:06,407
<i>The Gregorian monks</i>
<i>studied the heavens.</i>

548
01:07:06,476 --> 01:07:09,240
They were able to calculate
the precise moment of this event.

549
01:07:09,312 --> 01:07:12,076
<i>They created our calendar</i>
<i>by mapping this event...</i>

550
01:07:12,148 --> 01:07:14,776
<i>and counting backwards</i>
<i>from that moment.</i>

551
01:07:14,851 --> 01:07:18,652
It was a mistake to come here. It doesn't
matter whether you believe or not.

552
01:07:18,723 --> 01:07:21,851
He's real, and he won't rest
till he finds this girl.

553
01:07:21,926 --> 01:07:25,692
Why did he pick me? Because the stars
were right when you were born.

554
01:07:25,763 --> 01:07:29,164
<i>A man's body was also chosen,</i>
<i>just like yours.</i>

555
01:07:29,233 --> 01:07:32,670
<i>If the devil does exist,</i>
<i>why doesn't your god do anything?</i>

556
01:07:32,738 --> 01:07:38,040
It's not <i>my</i> God. It's <i>our</i> God, and
He doesn't say that He will save us.

557
01:07:38,110 --> 01:07:41,273
He says that we will save ourselves.

558
01:07:41,346 --> 01:07:44,612
<i>Save myself? What am I supposed</i>
<i>to do? Get a restraining order?</i>

559
01:07:44,684 --> 01:07:47,983
- We have to have faith.
- Faith.

560
01:07:48,054 --> 01:07:50,545
<i>Yes, faith.</i>
<i>It's an interesting concept.</i>

561
01:07:50,623 --> 01:07:53,820
If you read the Bible,
you can't miss it. Faith!

562
01:07:53,893 --> 01:07:58,478
Between your faith and my Glock
nine millimeter, I take my Glock.

563
01:07:58,504 --> 01:07:59,824
Come on. Let's go.

564
01:07:59,867 --> 01:08:03,564
I'm afraid it takes a person of
pure heart to defeat pure evil.

565
01:08:03,637 --> 01:08:06,470
You did your job. You brought her here
to people of faith. We'll protect her.

566
01:08:06,540 --> 01:08:10,772
- We'll hide her.
- You know, you live in a different world.

567
01:08:10,844 --> 01:08:14,474
We have some real serious problems here,
and this is not solving them.

568
01:08:14,549 --> 01:08:17,746
Satan's greatest trick was convincing man
he didn't exist.

569
01:08:21,556 --> 01:08:26,584
I don't, uh--
This all feels true to me.

570
01:08:26,661 --> 01:08:32,100
You'll be safer with me. At least I can
fight this guy with something real.

571
01:08:32,168 --> 01:08:34,659
<i>You know what to do.</i>
<i>You feel it.</i>

572
01:08:44,748 --> 01:08:47,080
I'm sorry.

573
01:08:49,219 --> 01:08:51,153
Let him go.

574
01:09:19,558 --> 01:09:22,152
It gets easier when you
accept what you are.

575
01:09:22,227 --> 01:09:26,324
A fallen soul.
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

576
01:09:29,703 --> 01:09:32,001
<i>Door's locked,</i>
<i>no windows broken.</i>

577
01:09:32,072 --> 01:09:35,530
- How did I get in here?
- Who the fuck are you?

578
01:09:35,608 --> 01:09:38,042
Oh, I think you know who I am.

579
01:09:38,111 --> 01:09:40,637
You just don't want to believe it.

580
01:09:42,249 --> 01:09:44,717
I took a bullet for you.

581
01:09:44,785 --> 01:09:47,117
I protected you.
Oh, no-no-no. You didn't protect me.

582
01:09:47,188 --> 01:09:51,488
You protected this body. Am I--
Am I getting a pattern here?

583
01:09:51,559 --> 01:09:57,021
So much pain.
"Not to be taken with alcohol."

584
01:09:57,099 --> 01:09:59,761
Remember that.

585
01:09:59,835 --> 01:10:01,803
Oh.

586
01:10:01,870 --> 01:10:04,532
<i>To lose a wife and child.</i>

587
01:10:06,007 --> 01:10:09,307
I can't even imagine
what that must be like.

588
01:10:09,378 --> 01:10:14,111
- What do you want?
- To make you happy again.

01:10:58,964 --> 01:11:00,898
Yes, you certainly do.

600
01:11:00,966 --> 01:11:03,594
But I don't think he'll be home.

601
01:11:03,669 --> 01:11:06,537
<i>Now, what makes you say</i>
<i>a silly thing like that?</i>

602
01:11:06,606 --> 01:11:09,404
He never comes home. <i>Well, honey,
you know your daddy works hard.</i>

603
01:11:09,476 --> 01:11:12,741
It's not about how much time you're
there. It's about "quality time."

604
01:11:12,813 --> 01:11:16,510
Now, he'll be home just like he promised.
You'll see.

605
01:11:16,583 --> 01:11:18,517
<i>He keeps his promises.</i>

606
01:11:18,585 --> 01:11:22,522
I can give it all back to you.
<i>Everything</i> that He took away.

607
01:11:22,590 --> 01:11:24,285
Everything.

608
01:11:24,358 --> 01:11:27,293
<i>You can hold your wife again.</i>

609
01:11:27,361 --> 01:11:31,092
You can watch your daughter walk through
the door in her prom dress.

610
01:11:31,165 --> 01:11:34,135
All you have to do is tell me
where the girl is.

611
01:11:34,203 --> 01:11:37,934
Come on. She's a nobody to you.
You don't even know her.

612
01:11:38,006 --> 01:11:40,497
You're in the middle of something
you don't really understand.

613
01:11:40,576 --> 01:11:43,807
You think you're saving her from me?
She wants to be with me.

614
01:11:43,879 --> 01:11:46,780
- <i>You know that.</i>
- What did you do in school today?

615
01:11:46,849 --> 01:11:50,547
<i>- You think I'd harm her?</i>
<i>-  I'd treat her like a queen.</i>

616
01:11:50,620 --> 01:11:54,215
Turn around, sweetheart. <i>You told me
you'd do anything to get your family back.</i>

617
01:11:54,290 --> 01:11:57,748
You want them?
This is your chance.

618
01:11:57,827 --> 01:12:01,092
They're not real.
<i>Does that matter?</i>

619
01:12:01,164 --> 01:12:03,861
- Oh, yes.
- <i>I think you need to be reminded...</i>

620
01:12:03,934 --> 01:12:06,494
of how painful reality is.

621
01:12:08,138 --> 01:12:10,504
<i>No!</i>

622
01:12:19,885 --> 01:12:21,648
Oh, shit!

623
01:12:30,262 --> 01:12:32,231
Don't hurt my baby!

624
01:12:32,298 --> 01:12:34,698
- <i>Daddy!</i>
- Let my daughter go!

625
01:12:37,169 --> 01:12:39,399
Daddy!

626
01:12:39,472 --> 01:12:43,932
Let go of my baby!

627
01:12:46,513 --> 01:12:48,378
No!

628
01:12:51,118 --> 01:12:54,451
Oh, it's true.

629
01:13:11,205 --> 01:13:14,107
It wasn't your fault.

630
01:13:14,176 --> 01:13:16,667
- I wasn't there.
- No, you were just--

631
01:13:16,745 --> 01:13:18,713
You were out doing your job.

632
01:13:18,781 --> 01:13:23,548
- I wasn't fucking there!
- Oh, look at you. Torn apart by guilt.

633
01:13:23,619 --> 01:13:27,681
You didn't do anything wrong. You were
an honest cop. You didn't take money.

634
01:13:27,757 --> 01:13:31,124
You had to testify against them even
after they threatened your family.

635
01:13:31,194 --> 01:13:33,219
Most people would never
testify against those guys.

636
01:13:33,296 --> 01:13:35,491
They're not like you.
You had to do the right thing.

637
01:13:35,565 --> 01:13:37,931
And where was God, hmm?

638
01:13:38,001 --> 01:13:40,993
He could've stopped it, but he didn't. He
fucked you. Then He made you feel guilty.

639
01:13:41,071 --> 01:13:44,098
Me, I don't do guilt.
I didn't do what happened here.

640
01:13:44,175 --> 01:13:47,440
He did.
Now you just think about that.

641
01:13:47,511 --> 01:13:49,445
Then you tell me
who's really your friend.

642
01:13:49,513 --> 01:13:52,038
I can make it like it never happened.

643
01:13:52,116 --> 01:13:54,949
<i>All for the price</i>
<i>of a stranger's address.</i>

644
01:13:56,355 --> 01:13:58,482
No!

645
01:14:00,092 --> 01:14:02,083
You will never see the girl!

646
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:05,561
Now, you see--
Now you're upsetting me.

647
01:14:05,630 --> 01:14:08,360
You don't want
to see me upset, believe me.

648
01:14:08,433 --> 01:14:11,699
Oh, you want to fuck with me?
You think you know bad, huh?

649
01:14:11,771 --> 01:14:15,468
You're a fucking choirboy
compared to me! A choirboy!

650
01:14:15,541 --> 01:14:18,476
You're in touch with your anger.
I really like that.

651
01:14:18,544 --> 01:14:21,513
I don't know about you,
but I'm going to have a drink.

652
01:14:21,581 --> 01:14:24,573
You and I are so much alike.

653
01:14:24,651 --> 01:14:27,449
We're nothing alike!
Nothing!

654
01:14:27,521 --> 01:14:31,116
Look at yourself. Look at this.
Look at what you are now.

655
01:14:31,191 --> 01:14:34,490
You walked away from the light,
just like me. You want one?

656
01:14:34,561 --> 01:14:38,965
- You need to get out, now.
- Come on. You know what's in your heart.

657
01:14:39,034 --> 01:14:42,492
<i>We're on the same side.</i>
I'm not on your side, and I never will be.

658
01:14:42,570 --> 01:14:46,631
You're on His side?
He's the one who took away your family.

659
01:14:46,708 --> 01:14:48,767
Let me tell you something about Him.

660
01:14:48,843 --> 01:14:52,108
He is the biggest underachiever
of all time.

661
01:14:52,180 --> 01:14:56,914
He just had a good publicist, that's all.
Something good happens: "It's His will."

662
01:14:56,986 --> 01:15:00,217
Something bad happens:
"He moves in mysterious ways."

663
01:15:00,289 --> 01:15:03,258
You take that-- that overblown
press kit they call the Bible.

664
01:15:03,325 --> 01:15:05,316
<i>You look for the answer in there,</i>
<i>what do they tell you?</i>

665
01:15:05,394 --> 01:15:09,024
"Shit happens."
 Please.

666
01:15:09,099 --> 01:15:13,035
He treated you like garbage.
You walked away.

667
01:15:13,103 --> 01:15:16,402
I'm not the bad guy.

668
01:15:16,473 --> 01:15:18,668
What about the End of Days?

669
01:15:18,742 --> 01:15:21,074
Think of it as a new beginning.

670
01:15:21,144 --> 01:15:24,706
A change of management. And you'll be
right there with me on the ground floor.

671
01:15:24,782 --> 01:15:28,047
It will be so cool.

672
01:15:28,119 --> 01:15:30,053
Tell me what you want.

673
01:15:30,121 --> 01:15:33,113
Tell me what you really want,
and I'll give it to you.

674
01:15:37,129 --> 01:15:39,723
I'll tell you what I want.

675
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:45,001
I want you to go to hell.

676
01:15:45,070 --> 01:15:49,439
You see, sometimes the problem is...

677
01:15:51,544 --> 01:15:54,035
hell...

678
01:15:54,114 --> 01:15:56,605
comes to you!

679
01:16:09,979 --> 01:16:12,777
Don't fuck up the coat.

680
01:16:15,251 --> 01:16:17,344
I've wasted
too much time on this.

681
01:16:17,420 --> 01:16:20,948
You see those insignificant little dots
down there? Huh? Do you see them?

682
01:16:21,025 --> 01:16:24,517
That's what you mean to me.
Now, give me the girl!

683
01:16:24,595 --> 01:16:26,688
Not today.

684
01:16:51,958 --> 01:16:54,426
Look down.

685
01:16:54,494 --> 01:16:59,295
Now, look in your heart and tell me
you don't want to die.

686
01:16:59,365 --> 01:17:01,265
All you got to do is take my hand.

687
01:17:01,334 --> 01:17:04,429
And I'll give you back
everything that He took away.

688
01:17:08,342 --> 01:17:10,970
- Come on.
- Okay.

689
01:17:11,044 --> 01:17:15,947
<i>Okay. Okay. Okay.</i>

690
01:17:23,525 --> 01:17:25,584
Fuck... you!

691
01:18:13,412 --> 01:18:15,403
Hey.
Hey!

692
01:18:17,082 --> 01:18:19,482
- I thought you were dead.
- Couple of seconds, I would've been.

693
01:18:19,551 --> 01:18:22,952
All I remember is steppin' out of the van,
then I woke up in the fucking gutter.

694
01:18:23,021 --> 01:18:25,854
What the hell are you doing here?
What are you talking about?

695
01:18:25,924 --> 01:18:29,258
<i>I've been lookin' for you all night.</i>
<i>What the hell happened to you?</i>

696
01:18:32,599 --> 01:18:35,159
- Hey. Hey. Hey.
- I can't trust you.

697
01:18:35,235 --> 01:18:39,035
I don't know how much you had to drink,
okay, but let's not point the gun at me?

698
01:18:39,105 --> 01:18:41,130
I just need to know.
You need to know what?

699
01:18:41,207 --> 01:18:44,974
That you are you. Of course I'm me!
What the hell are you talking about?

700
01:18:47,748 --> 01:18:50,546
You took his body.
All right. You're ill.

701
01:18:50,618 --> 01:18:53,451
Okay?
You need some help. All right?

702
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:56,045
Oh, fuck!
Jesus!

703
01:18:56,124 --> 01:18:58,388
- Fuck.
- You're bleeding.

704
01:18:58,460 --> 01:19:00,860
Of course I'm bleeding!
You fuckin' shot me!

705
01:19:00,929 --> 01:19:04,228
I just needed to find out!
You found out, okay?

706
01:19:04,299 --> 01:19:07,826
Stop being such a pussy!
It's just a scratch. Pussy? Come on!

707
01:19:07,902 --> 01:19:10,428
Oh, Christ.
Does it hurt?

708
01:19:10,506 --> 01:19:12,872
What do you think?
Jesus.

709
01:19:12,942 --> 01:19:15,604
What the hell's the matter with you?
What's going on here?

710
01:19:15,678 --> 01:19:17,646
I can't explain it.

711
01:19:20,950 --> 01:19:24,078
I shouldn't have left
her alone like that.

712
01:19:24,153 --> 01:19:27,851
- I should be with her.
<i>- Tell me what to do.</i>

713
01:19:27,924 --> 01:19:30,085
I gotta get back there.

714
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:32,560
Got to get her as far away
from him as I can.

715
01:19:32,629 --> 01:19:35,496
Okay, we'll leave town.
You get her. I'll get a Striker car.

716
01:19:35,565 --> 01:19:37,556
Just tell me where to meet you.

717
01:19:44,208 --> 01:19:47,336
St. John's Church... in one hour.

718
01:19:52,984 --> 01:19:55,681
<i>How much longer, Father?</i>

719
01:19:55,754 --> 01:20:00,020
Well, he has to sire his child between
11:00 and midnight tomorrow night.

720
01:20:00,092 --> 01:20:03,721
So, we must keep you hidden until
that hour passes.

721
01:20:08,902 --> 01:20:12,360
We've come to help.
Your Eminence.

722
01:20:12,439 --> 01:20:15,875
In this hour of darkness,
we need all the help we can get.

723
01:20:18,545 --> 01:20:21,811
How's the girl?
The girl's fine. Thanks.

724
01:20:26,220 --> 01:20:28,313
No.

725
01:20:28,389 --> 01:20:31,552
No. Father! Father, they're the ones
who tried to kill me!

726
01:20:34,061 --> 01:20:36,189
- No!
- <i>Your Eminence, what are you doing?</i>

727
01:20:36,264 --> 01:20:38,357
<i>We cannot allow this union to take place.</i>
<i>No! No.</i>

728
01:20:38,433 --> 01:20:39,798
Please!
<i>You can't! You mustn't!</i>

729
01:20:39,868 --> 01:20:42,803
<i>- Let go!</i>
- She is only one life.

730
01:20:42,871 --> 01:20:45,237
<i>How many lives are you prepared</i>
<i>to end if we do nothing?</i>

731
01:20:45,307 --> 01:20:47,298
- That's not who we are.
- Of course it is.

732
01:20:47,376 --> 01:20:50,676
We are doing God's work.
We are preventing the End of Days.

733
01:20:50,747 --> 01:20:54,308
But you can't prevent evil
by doing evil.

734
01:20:54,384 --> 01:20:56,375
- There is no time!
- No!

735
01:20:56,452 --> 01:20:58,477
- It's the only way.
- <i>No-o-o!</i>

736
01:20:58,554 --> 01:21:00,317
<i>May God forgive us!</i>

737
01:21:00,390 --> 01:21:02,324
Amen.

738
01:21:07,464 --> 01:21:10,456
I can do this all day long.

739
01:21:10,534 --> 01:21:13,094
Now, let her go.

740
01:21:13,170 --> 01:21:15,229
You must let us finish.

741
01:21:15,305 --> 01:21:18,969
<i>If she is slain, his hope of creating</i>
<i>a kingdom on Earth dies with her.</i>

742
01:21:19,043 --> 01:21:21,910
<i>- Her death is God's will.</i>
- It's not God's will.

743
01:21:21,980 --> 01:21:24,107
<i>It's your will, and it will</i>
<i>lead to our destruction.</i> Jericho.

744
01:21:24,182 --> 01:21:26,742
<i>She must be removed.</i>
<i>It's the only way to defeat him.</i>

745
01:21:26,818 --> 01:21:30,117
For a thousand years,
we prepared ourselves for this.

746
01:21:30,188 --> 01:21:33,021
We're not afraid to die.
Good.

747
01:21:33,091 --> 01:21:35,185
Because I'm not afraid to kill you.

748
01:21:35,261 --> 01:21:37,559
Let her go.

749
01:21:55,907 --> 01:21:58,034
Go. Go.
Get out of here.

750
01:21:59,778 --> 01:22:01,872
<i>Go!</i>

751
01:22:08,321 --> 01:22:11,415
God help us.
We're too late.

752
01:22:13,660 --> 01:22:17,392
- I've come for my wife.
- Let's go.

753
01:22:17,464 --> 01:22:20,297
<i>This is the house of the Lord, our God,</i>
<i>and you are not welcome here.</i>

754
01:22:21,969 --> 01:22:26,872
I can stand the pain of being in church.
How much pain can you bear?

755
01:22:26,940 --> 01:22:29,738
Christine!
Come to me.

756
01:22:29,810 --> 01:22:32,405
<i>I am the one</i>
<i>you've been waiting for.</i>

757
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:34,573
I am the answer to your prayers.

758
01:22:34,649 --> 01:22:37,618
In the name of God,
I order you to leave here now!

759
01:22:42,357 --> 01:22:45,452
<i>May the wrath of God destroy--</i>

760
01:23:09,052 --> 01:23:13,854
A thousand years you have waited for
my return. And behold, you have failed.

761
01:23:13,925 --> 01:23:18,988
And with your last breath you shall
bear witness to the End of Days.

762
01:23:41,754 --> 01:23:44,519
No! Jericho!

763
01:23:52,232 --> 01:23:54,200
Get in the car!
Run!

764
01:23:56,971 --> 01:23:59,064
Jesus! Come on!

765
01:24:10,452 --> 01:24:13,046
Bobby, what the hell are you doing?

766
01:24:13,121 --> 01:24:15,248
What are you doing?
Open the door! <i>Open up!</i>

767
01:24:15,323 --> 01:24:17,348
- Come on! Open up!
- Open the door!

768
01:24:19,461 --> 01:24:23,454
Jer--
Please, stop the car! Please!

769
01:24:33,075 --> 01:24:35,543
Jer!

770
01:25:15,354 --> 01:25:17,879
Jer!

771
01:25:57,866 --> 01:25:59,800
<i>You should have taken my offer.</i>

772
01:25:59,868 --> 01:26:02,666
<i>At least you would have</i>
<i>been happy once in your life.</i>

773
01:26:09,212 --> 01:26:12,978
Let her go, or I'll kill you.

774
01:26:13,049 --> 01:26:15,916
Ooh, so much anger, so much hatred.

775
01:26:15,985 --> 01:26:18,317
You're almost there.

776
01:26:23,627 --> 01:26:27,791
I'm gonna hurt you so bad,
you're gonna beg to die.

777
01:26:27,865 --> 01:26:31,801
But I'm not gonna let you.
It's not gonna be that easy.

778
01:26:31,869 --> 01:26:36,830
You're mine, and I want you
to see what's gonna happen.

779
01:27:32,862 --> 01:27:35,490
<i>World religious
leaders have asked their followers...</i>

780

<i>to prepare for the new millennium not</i>
<i>with celebrating and partying...</i>

781
01:27:39,268 --> 01:27:41,736

<i>of kindness, compassion--</i>

782
01:27:41,804 --> 01:27:46,299
<i>This is it, New York.</i>
<i>The last day of the first 2,000 years.</i>

783
01:28:57,286 --> 01:29:02,121
- How long have I been out?
- You almost slept the whole day.

784
01:29:02,191 --> 01:29:05,285
You're lucky to be alive.

785
01:29:14,370 --> 01:29:16,304
The time?

786
01:29:16,372 --> 01:29:19,603
It's almost 7:00.
It's not too late.

787
01:29:19,676 --> 01:29:22,839
He has the girl.
But it's not too late.

788

<i>Jesus, what did you do?</i>
<i>Get hit by a truck?</i>

790
01:29:55,882 --> 01:29:57,941
No, the truck missed me.

791
01:30:25,847 --> 01:30:28,873
Where the hell are you goin'?
Doing my job.

792
01:30:28,950 --> 01:30:31,077
<i>You know, the cops are after you.</i>

793
01:30:31,152 --> 01:30:33,086
<i>They have to wait.</i>
<i>I've got to do something.</i>

794
01:30:41,897 --> 01:30:44,127
That son of a bitch.

795
01:32:18,901 --> 01:32:23,133
Yes.
You wish entrance?

796
01:32:25,174 --> 01:32:31,011
You have much hatred
and vengeance in your heart.

797
01:32:31,081 --> 01:32:33,447
You may pass.

798

<i>Princeps finis dierum.</i>

01:35:16,220 --> 01:35:20,350
Angelus obscurus.

804
01:35:20,424 --> 01:35:22,757
Angelus obscurus.

01:35:22,827 --> 01:35:26,285
Angelus obscurus.

806
01:35:26,364 --> 01:35:30,767
You can't resist, can you?
'Cause you don't want to.

807
01:35:33,838 --> 01:35:38,538
I didn't come here to hurt you.
I came here to love you.

808
01:35:41,814 --> 01:35:45,875
Relax.
Give yourself to me.

809
01:36:14,315 --> 01:36:16,783
- No one move, or I kill the girl.
- What are you doing?

810
01:36:16,851 --> 01:36:19,787
- Trust me.
- You're not gonna kill her.

811
01:36:19,855 --> 01:36:22,085
<i>You said it yourself.</i>
<i>I have a dark heart.</i>

812
01:36:22,157 --> 01:36:24,557
- Then stand with me.
- I'll tell you what.

813
01:36:24,626 --> 01:36:29,529
<i>You let us both out of here,</i>
<i>and I'll stand wherever you want.</i>

814
01:36:29,598 --> 01:36:32,999
- Step back, or I'll pull the trigger.
- I didn't want to kill you.

815
01:36:33,068 --> 01:36:35,003
<i>But now you leave me no choice.</i>

816
01:36:42,312 --> 01:36:45,611
Let her go, Jer.

817
01:36:45,682 --> 01:36:47,617
<i>Oh, don't look at me like that.</i>

818
01:36:47,685 --> 01:36:49,710
You'd be amazed what you agree to
when you're on fire.

819
01:36:49,787 --> 01:36:53,120
Don't do it, Bobby.
You're better than this.

820
01:36:53,190 --> 01:36:56,421
You're better than him. You know,
considering how you've lived your life,

821
01:36:56,493 --> 01:37:00,623
when this is all over, what makes you
think you're going upstairs anyways, huh?

822
01:37:00,698 --> 01:37:04,635
Come on, Jer. This is the main event.
It's gonna happen.

823
01:37:04,703 --> 01:37:06,869
Why shouldn't you have the
best seats in the house?

824
01:37:06,895 --> 01:37:10,673
You will never get a shot
off, and you know it.

825
01:37:14,079 --> 01:37:15,979
Don't do it.

826
01:37:18,884 --> 01:37:22,479
<i>Bobby.</i>

827
01:37:22,555 --> 01:37:24,785
I thought we had a deal?

828
01:37:24,857 --> 01:37:27,155
<i>Bobby.</i>

829
01:37:45,646 --> 01:37:48,740
Well, I guess the deal's off.

830
01:37:55,390 --> 01:37:57,688
No!

831
01:38:00,162 --> 01:38:02,392
You son of a bitch!

832
01:38:33,998 --> 01:38:36,558
Here!
This way!

833
01:38:49,781 --> 01:38:51,715
Up here.

834
01:39:02,528 --> 01:39:04,928
Shit!

835
01:39:31,492 --> 01:39:34,620
- Oh, thank God. I thought I hit you.
- Just get us out of here!

836
01:39:39,434 --> 01:39:41,163
Let's go.
Give me a minute.

837
01:39:42,904 --> 01:39:46,237
I'd feel better if you'd show me how
to use one of those things.

838
01:39:46,308 --> 01:39:50,711
- <i>I want to do something. Let me help.</i>
- All right. Here.

839
01:39:50,779 --> 01:39:54,011
You take the gun.
Line up the sight with your target.

840
01:39:54,083 --> 01:39:56,643
Uh-huh. Beware of the recoil.
Here's the magazine.

841
01:39:56,719 --> 01:39:58,846
Put it in. Load.

842
01:39:58,921 --> 01:40:01,685
Only pull the trigger when you're ready--

843
01:40:04,060 --> 01:40:06,528
Like that?
Yeah, like that.

844
01:40:28,920 --> 01:40:30,945
He's on the tracks!

845
01:40:32,090 --> 01:40:33,853
Shit!

846
01:40:33,925 --> 01:40:36,588
- Don't stop! Don't stop!
- What are you doing?

847
01:40:56,850 --> 01:40:58,477
He's gone.

848
01:41:51,175 --> 01:41:53,006
Oh, God.

849
01:41:55,579 --> 01:41:57,308
Go on.

850
01:42:03,188 --> 01:42:05,986
We must separate the cars.
Separate the cars. What?

851
01:42:27,146 --> 01:42:29,341
Jericho!

852
01:42:31,385 --> 01:42:33,250
Jericho!

853
01:42:44,498 --> 01:42:48,060
Jericho!

854
01:42:56,110 --> 01:42:58,840
That's it. Come on.

855
01:43:06,355 --> 01:43:08,550
Jericho!

856
01:43:48,733 --> 01:43:50,997
Here. Hold on!

857
01:44:45,794 --> 01:44:48,820
Jericho!

858
01:44:48,898 --> 01:44:53,302
<i>How can you expect to defeat me</i>

860
01:45:35,013 --> 01:45:37,676

01:46:22,457 --> 01:46:24,891
What are we gonna do?

865
01:46:30,031 --> 01:46:33,194
Hide. Just hide!
No.

866
01:47:49,216 --> 01:47:53,016
Please, God, help me.

867
01:47:54,288 --> 01:47:56,882
Give me strength.

Christine.

869
01:51:02,556 --> 01:51:04,581
Christine?

870

Jericho?

871
01:51:12,467 --> 01:51:14,628
Are you all right?

872
01:51:14,702 --> 01:51:18,536
What happened?
It's over.

873
01:51:18,606 --> 01:51:21,075
We won.

874
01:51:21,143 --> 01:51:22,770
We won.

875
01:51:27,383 --> 01:51:29,510
Let's go.

876
01:51:32,321 --> 01:51:34,222
Huh?

877
01:51:37,694 --> 01:51:41,858
- What's wrong?
- Nothing is wrong.

878
01:51:43,833 --> 01:51:47,030
Everything is the way it should be.

879
01:51:47,103 --> 01:51:50,835
No! Jericho! No! No!

880
01:51:50,908 --> 01:51:53,433
