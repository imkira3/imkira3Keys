1
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:35,242
Billions of years ago...

2
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:40,039
...a race of immortals harnessed
the most powerful force in existence:

3
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,667
The emerald energy of willpower.

4
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:46,253
These immortals,
the Guardians of the Universe...

5
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:49,798
...built a world from where they could
watch over all of existence:

6
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:52,342
The planet Oa.

7
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:57,431
They divided the universe
into 3600 sectors.

8
00:00:57,599 --> 00:01:03,103
A ring powered by the energy of will was
sent to every sector to select a recruit.

9
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:08,650
In order to be chosen by the ring,
it was said one must be without fear.

10
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:11,779
Together, these 3600 recruits...

11
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:17,910
...formed the intergalactic peacekeepers
known as the Green Lantern Corps.

12
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:29,630
Of all the threats the Corps ever faced...

13
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:33,967
...the gravest was an entity of fear
known as Parallax.

14
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:36,678
Only the legendary Green Lantern
Abin Sur...

15
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:40,182
...was capable of capturing
and imprisoning this beast...

16
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:44,144
...which he did on the lost planet of Ryut.

17
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,610
You are afraid.

18
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:16,737
Good.

19
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:44,825
- I mean, we go into this every time.
- It's not every time.

20
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:48,787
- No, honey. Think back.
- Think back. Think back.

21
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:52,457
I was fine the last time. I'm usually fine.
I'm fine with your work.

22
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:56,461
- Can I just tell you something?
- Of course you can.

23
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,174
- I'm scared, honey.
- Shh, shh.

24
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,326
Is everything okay?

25
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:31,204
Oh, you know how Mom gets
the night before a test flight.

26
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:35,542
But you're not scared, are you, Dad?

27
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:40,797
Let's just say it's my job not to be.

28
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,470
Good night, son.

29
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:35,602
Hal, you're gonna be late.

30
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:38,897
Good morning, Mom. Gotta go.

31
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:19,104
Dad! Dad! Dad!

32
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:27,320
- You think she'll break mach 3?
- We'll find out soon enough.

33
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:29,573
Hey, shouldn't you be in school?

34
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,701
Mr. Ferris raised the rear stabilizer.

35
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:34,995
Yes, he did.

36
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:38,248
The yaw rate gyros are calibrated,
but the pitch is off 2 degrees.

37
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,418
- I can live with that. How about the INS?
- Good to go.

38
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:42,794
- Okay.
- Johnny.

39
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,464
- Be sure to check the ignition sequences.
- No problem.

40
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,048
- We did, Carl, twice.
- Right.

41
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:50,510
And, uh, the gyros?
Did we do the gyro calibrations?

42
00:07:58,436 --> 00:07:59,686
Hey, Carl.

43
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,898
Maybe Hal would like to join Carol
up in your office.

44
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:07,736
- The two of them can watch together.
- Come on, young man. Let's go find Carol.

45
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,029
Hal.

46
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,495
Keep it warm for me.

47
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:23,335
- Hi.
- Oh, hey, Hector.

48
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:27,631
Hey. So, um, I have this book.

49
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:30,217
It's about the possibility
of life on other planets.

50
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,262
- Cool.
- Well, it almost has to exist, but...

51
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,765
- Hal!
- Hey, Carol.

52
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:39,643
Hector. You still wanna
trade Hot Wheels?

53
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,228
Sure.

54
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:45,524
Well, look who's here.
Our future test pilot.

55
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:47,359
Jacket suits you, son.

56
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,902
- Hi, Dad.
- Hey.

57
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:52,113
I keep telling Hector, books are fun,
but every once in a while...

58
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:55,575
...it's not such a bad idea to get
out in the world, right, Hal?

59
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:58,286
- Hey, Bob.
- The man of the hour.

60
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:01,373
Nothing like a first flight
to get the blood boiling, eh, Carl?

61
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,542
Dad, can we watch
from down in the field?

62
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,377
- Sure.
- Yes!

63
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,672
- You kids be careful.
- Stay with the engineers.

64
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:10,799
Go on, son. See it up close.

65
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:14,135
That's okay, Dad. I'll be fine.

66
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:18,306
Ferris Tower, Sabre One,
ready for take-off.

67
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:21,309
Request unrestricted climb,
flight level 450.

68
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:29,526
Yes! Yes!

69
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:32,028
Sabre One,
unrestricted climb approved.

70
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:34,781
On passing 10,000 feet,
contact Ferris Departure.

71
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,951
You're cleared for take-off.
Good luck, Sabre.

72
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:14,404
Whoo! Yeah, Dad!

73
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:57,776
Sinestro, I'm traveling at maximum velocity.
Tell Fentara I should...

74
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,402
Fentara is dead.

75
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:03,948
The planet's inhabitants?

76
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,576
Your mission to evacuate them
is no longer necessary.

77
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:09,204
It's just as it was on Talok.

78
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:12,624
Every life form destroyed
and their essence absorbed.

79
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,959
Traces of yellow power everywhere.

80
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,461
And the Guardians?

81
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,088
The Guardians are silent.

82
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:21,299
I've demanded an audience with them.

83
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,435
Abin Sur.

84
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:25,613
I'm badly wounded.

85
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:30,660
Heading to the nearest inhabited planet
for the selection process.

86
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:34,497
Tell the Guardians it's Parallax.

87
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:51,681
No. No.

88
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:00,356
Sorry, I gotta run.
Make yourself at home, okay?

89
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:02,275
There's, uh, water in the tap.

90
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:28,635
No!

91
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:30,470
Yup.

92
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,018
Asshole.

93
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:43,691
The Ferris Sabre I I I is state-of-the-art
of artificial-intelligence fighter planes.

94
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:47,695
It has all of the flying and combat
capability of a human pilot...

95
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:50,990
...but with none of the human error
that comes with it.

96
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:54,160
Carl isn't just blowing smoke
to get a contract, general.

97
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:56,371
Your staff, these contractors, my office...

98
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:58,915
...we've all been part of this
from the ground up.

99
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:00,917
Well, I appreciate that, senator.

100
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,169
But today the rubber meets the road.

101
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:08,341
We have a simulated combat situation.
Two Sabres against Carl's two best pilots.

102
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:27,944
Carol. Was gonna do a little flying today.
What do you think?

103
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,362
I think you're late.

104
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,614
Yes, but that's only because I slept in.

105
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,783
I used to sleep in. Then I turned 11.

106
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:35,827
Let me give you a little heads-up.

107
00:16:35,994 --> 00:16:39,414
I've gone up against these Sabres all week
and they smoked me every time.

108
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:42,959
There isn't anything you can do that
they can't do better, faster...

109
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,420
...and without disappointing women
everywhere.

110
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:47,964
I, uh, think we both know that's not true.

111
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:51,551
This is exactly why I didn't want you
for this. My father did.

112
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,136
I would've gone with Jensen.

113
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:56,973
I'd have too, but unfortunately
he's busy not being good enough.

114
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,683
At least he shows up.

115
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,351
Hal...

116
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,478
...this test today, it's important.

117
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:05,481
I'm gonna make you look good up there.
Don't worry, okay?

118
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:09,277
Now let's get these pants off
and fly some planes.

119
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:14,157
Highball, weapon check now.

120
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:15,658
Roger that.

121
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:20,788
- Good morning, Mr. Ferris.
- Morning, everybody.

122
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:23,499
Gentlemen.

123
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:28,004
- We about ready, Tom?
- Yes, Mr. Ferris. We are go for test.

124
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:31,174
Sapphire, cleared weapons hot
at the merge.

125
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:33,968
Ferris Test, Sapphire. Weapons are hot.

126
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,928
Fly safe, Highball.

127
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:38,181
Um, no.

128
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:51,861
Goddamn it!
Tom, what the hell you feed those things?

129
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,696
F-35s, what else?

130
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,830
Wakey, wakey, Sapphire.

131
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:04,999
You got a shot,
now would be a great time.

132
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:08,085
Easy, Highball. Just lining it up.

133
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:24,227
There's no way
we're taking these out solo.

134
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:26,646
Get over here.
Let's figure something out.

135
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:29,148
On my way, Highball.

136
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:36,823
Now stay right there and look real pretty.

137
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:02,515
Highball, did you just use your wingman
as a decoy?

138
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:28,624
Highball, those Sabres headed up your 6
can fly anywhere you can.

139
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,710
Then let's go somewhere I can't fly.

140
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,716
What the hell is he up to?

141
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:38,259
Coffin corner.

142
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:43,139
Highball, rules of engagement
set ceiling at 50,000 feet.

143
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:46,601
Yeah, because the Sabres will stall
if they go any higher, right, Tom?

144
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:47,977
And so will you.

145
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:56,319
Compressor stall. Compressor stall.

146
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:35,358
Yes!

147
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:43,199
Um, I mean, damn it, Hal.

148
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:45,993
Your boy certainly
takes his job seriously.

149
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,622
Ailerons, Hal. Side to side.

150
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:50,831
I got it.

151
00:20:55,253 --> 00:20:56,295
Hal.

152
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,219
Keep it warm for me.

153
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:07,014
Going through 25,000.

154
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,392
Hey, you okay, Highball?

155
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,228
Yeah, just taking my victory lap.

156
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:22,571
- Going through 20,000.
- Okay, Highball, give me some roll.

157
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,372
Yeah, Dad!

158
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:34,041
Hal, do you read me?

159
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:46,762
Highball, you're approaching
minimum ejection altitude.

160
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:54,603
Highball, you're below 10,000 AGL.
Spin is unrecoverable.

161
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:57,189
Eject, eject, eject!

162
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:00,359
You're not scared, are you, Dad?

163
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:03,362
Let's just say it's my job not to be.

164
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:10,453
Dad!

165
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:15,374
Dad!

166
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,979
You stupid son of a bitch. You...

167
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:39,190
Stand down, Bob. It doesn't matter now.

168
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:40,524
It does matter.

169
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:43,611
Never mind that you crashed
a brand-new F-35.

170
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:46,655
You broke the rules of engagement.
You sacrificed your wingman.

171
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:49,450
And you blew the contract
this company was depending on.

172
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:51,577
I'm sorry. I thought this was a dogfight.

173
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:54,246
I was under the impression
the objective was to win.

174
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:57,500
No, the objective was to show
what the Sabres could do in combat.

175
00:22:57,667 --> 00:23:00,628
And in combat,
no pilot is gonna crater his own plane.

176
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:02,463
I did.

177
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:07,009
Now you know you gotta boost the ceiling.
I showed you what they can't do.

178
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:09,845
You didn't have to make that point
in front of Air Force Acquisitions.

179
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:11,263
That's enough, Carol.

180
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:16,977
Since I'm gonna have to lay off most of
my company anyway, you're fired, Hal.

181
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:18,270
It's too late. I quit.

182
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:20,064
He's not fired and you don't quit.

183
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,858
You're grounded,
pending the results of an investigation.

184
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:32,034
Watch your back.

185
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,661
That's impossible, Bob.

186
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:43,045
- Tell me what happened.
- Controls locked up.

187
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:46,632
Don't give me that, Hal. You had a
window when you could've recovered.

188
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,342
Did you choke?

189
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,636
You wouldn't be the first,
but I need to know.

190
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:53,514
My controls locked up.
What the hell is all this, anyway?

191
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,182
What's with the ridiculous suit?

192
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:59,103
- I know your dad's been bucking for you...
- The merits of my career choices...

193
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:03,482
You're a pilot, and a good one.
Giving that up to fly a desk is bullshit.

194
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:04,984
I like it and I'm good at it.

195
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:08,863
Doesn't mean I'll never get in a cockpit
again. It isn't one way or the other.

196
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:12,449
That's the way a child looks at things,
and we aren't children anymore.

197
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:15,494
At least...

198
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:22,668
I just don't wanna see
someone I care about getting hurt.

199
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,421
Least of all you.

200
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:05,753
Choose well.

201
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:33,155
A test pilot's daring maneuvers
almost ended in tragedy.

202
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:37,785
Witnesses say pilot Hal Jordan
ejected at the last possible second...

203
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:40,037
...before his jet crashed
in the open desert.

204
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:42,122
He's the son of the late Martin Jordan...

205
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:45,334
...who was killed in his own
ill-fated test flight back in 1993.

206
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:48,045
We are told that Hal Jordan
is doing fine right now...

207
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:51,048
...though we have yet to hear
an official statement.

208
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,257
Hey, guys.

209
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:56,011
The incident has been a blow
to a new high-tech aircraft program...

210
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:57,596
Hey. How was work?

211
00:25:57,764 --> 00:26:00,349
Oh. It was amazing, Jack.
Thank you for asking. Hey, Janice.

212
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:03,644
Just help me out here, because
I'm really trying to understand this.

213
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:05,688
- Mm-hm.
- Do you wanna be like him so bad?

214
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:08,107
- You just assume it's my fault.
- I talked to Carl.

215
00:26:08,274 --> 00:26:10,401
- Oh. Heh, heh.
- You pushed the plane past its limits...

216
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:13,362
That's my job. It was an accident.
Everybody walked away.

217
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:17,032
Like your motorcycle accident
that put you in the hospital for a month?

218
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,910
I miss all this quality family time.
Good talk, Jack.

219
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:33,757
Where's Jason?

220
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:35,884
In his room.

221
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:37,594
Why?

222
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,932
Hey, it's Uncle Hal.

223
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:44,184
What's up there, ace?

224
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:48,105
This is the worst 11 th birthday party
I've ever been to.

225
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,691
No dancing girls?
What's going on...? Hey.

226
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:53,193
Hey.

227
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:55,654
I'm fine.

228
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:58,198
I guess I got a little freaked out
or something.

229
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:00,242
It happens.

230
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:01,493
Not to you.

231
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:03,412
Look...

232
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:06,290
...you don't have anything
to worry about.

233
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:07,499
You wanna know why?

234
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:11,503
Yeah, I may be a total screw-up
in every other part of my life...

235
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:15,716
...but the one thing I do know
how to do is fly.

236
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:20,137
You know, I used to know this kid.

237
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,765
Was a funny-looking little bastard.

238
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:26,852
One day, he's standing on the mound,
and he throws a perfect game.

239
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:30,022
That... That was me.

240
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:32,066
That was you?

241
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:36,445
Thought you looked familiar.

242
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:42,117
You were totally in the zone that day.
Remember?

243
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:46,872
- I still dream about it.
- I bet.

244
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:49,625
Take it.

245
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,585
Close your eyes.

246
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,129
Go on.

247
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:01,136
Now...

248
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:04,431
...can you remember
exactly how you felt that day?

249
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:09,812
That's how I feel when I'm flying.

250
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:12,439
Like that plane is a part of me.

251
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:16,819
No, it's like,
no matter how bad things get...

252
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:21,490
...there's something good out there...

253
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:23,992
...just over the horizon.

254
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:30,874
I could really feel it.

255
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:33,961
Yeah.

256
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:36,547
Me too.

257
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:48,976
Hey, got you something, birthday boy.
Wrapped it myself.

258
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:56,358
Cool. It's an X-1, right?

259
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:59,611
It's a Starfighter. My dad gave me that.

260
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:01,446
Let's put it up.

261
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:05,284
What happened today?

262
00:29:05,451 --> 00:29:07,119
I mean, when you crashed.

263
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:09,204
Not really sure, exactly.

264
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:12,624
Were you scared?

265
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:16,461
It's my job not to be.

266
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:21,967
You know, you're totally missing
your super-lame birthday party.

267
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:25,721
Beat it. Go, go, go!

268
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:30,142
I'm glad you're okay.

269
00:29:33,479 --> 00:29:35,564
Me too, ace.

270
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:51,079
Get off! No!

271
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,667
Aah! No!

272
00:30:57,397 --> 00:31:01,191
- Come on, stay with me. Stay with me.
- I'm gonna get you some help.

273
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:04,861
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay. Okay, hold on.

274
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:07,322
Your name. Your name.

275
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:10,158
It's Hal. Hal Jordan.

276
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:15,247
Hal Jordan, I am Abin Sur,
protector of Sector 2814.

277
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:16,665
Okay, hey, listen.

278
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:22,296
We're gonna get you to a hospital, okay?
Okay? One that carries purple blood.

279
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,881
The ring...

280
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:26,550
...it chose you.

281
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:28,218
Take it!

282
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,639
Place the ring in the lantern.

283
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:35,392
Place the ring, speak the oath...

284
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:38,020
- What?
- Great honor, responsibility...

285
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:40,772
I don't understand.
Breathe. You gotta breathe, okay?

286
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:43,400
All you gotta do is breathe.
Just breathe, okay?

287
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:46,069
Hey, hey, hey. No, no, no.
Hey, hey.

288
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:50,073
Hey, hey, hey. Come on, man.
No, no, no, don't do that.

289
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:54,036
Hey, now, don't do that.

290
00:31:54,912 --> 00:31:56,913
Oh, come on.

291
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:12,596
X-97 systems check complete.

292
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,269
Yo.

293
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:22,856
Come again?

294
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:41,958
Hmm.

295
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,086
Is that a spaceship?

296
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:45,796
Yeah.

297
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:48,465
Is it real?

298
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:50,801
It's real.

299
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:53,804
Did you see what kind of power source
this thing uses?

300
00:32:53,971 --> 00:32:55,764
- Do you understand...?
- We can't stay.

301
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:57,182
- We can't stay here.
- What?

302
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,226
- Gotta go.
- What?

303
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:00,977
Pilot.

304
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:04,231
He wore a uniform.
I think he was a soldier.

305
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,233
He gave me this.

306
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:07,943
He proposed?

307
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:15,742
We're gone. We're gone, now!

308
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:34,761
They're gonna know someone was there.
Alien pilots don't bury themselves.

309
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:36,513
I couldn't just leave him there.

310
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:39,307
I hope this thing isn't radioactive.

311
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:42,519
- Yeah, well, you're the genius. You... Aah!
- Aah!

312
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,354
- Jesus!
- Aah! Whoa!

313
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:48,942
Got it!

314
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:53,655
He said that the ring chose me.

315
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:57,200
He said it was a great honor.
Responsibility.

316
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:58,702
Responsibility?

317
00:33:58,870 --> 00:33:59,870
- Yeah.
- You?

318
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:06,209
Well, maybe on their planet
"responsibility" just means "asshole."

319
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:08,545
Let's hope so.

320
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:24,728
A great light has gone out
in the universe.

321
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:27,314
Abin Sur is dead.

322
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:32,986
Four of my Lantern brothers killed.

323
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:37,574
The inhabitants of two worlds
annihilated by an unknown enemy.

324
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:40,869
An enemy that possesses
the yellow power of fear.

325
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:48,793
We know it originated from
within the Lost Sector.

326
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:52,380
We know it grows more powerful
with each encounter.

327
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:57,761
According to Abin Sur's last transmission,
he seemed to know what it was.

328
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:01,848
His only words were, "It's Parallax."

329
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:12,400
We are aware of the threat.
We are assessing the situation.

330
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:17,239
While you assess,
innocent lives will be lost.

331
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,282
Let me take the fight to this enemy.

332
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:22,953
There is much of which
you are not aware, Sinestro.

333
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,872
If the danger is as great as we suspect...

334
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,791
What are you saying?

335
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:31,253
You believe this enemy can defeat us?

336
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:44,641
Guardians, if your faith in our power
has faltered, let me renew it.

337
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:48,436
Let me take a squadron of my strongest
Lanterns against this enemy...

338
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:52,566
...and I'll prove to you
our best days are not behind us.

339
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:34,733
Dr. Hammond?

340
00:36:35,901 --> 00:36:37,360
Dr. Hector Hammond?

341
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:40,530
We need to ask you to come with us.

342
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:45,493
Did Adam put you up to this?

343
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:03,053
Get out of the car, please.

344
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:34,417
Whoa.

345
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:51,101
Dr. Hammond?

346
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:52,686
Dr. Amanda Waller.

347
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:57,565
I must apologize for the theatrics,
but the government does like its protocols.

348
00:37:57,733 --> 00:37:59,526
Please, follow me.

349
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:23,675
Is that what I think it is?

350
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:26,469
An alien life form, doctor.

351
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:29,097
The first that mankind
has ever encountered...

352
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:32,684
...despite what the conspiracy theorists
would have you believe.

353
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:36,563
We want you to do the initial assessment
of its physiology.

354
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:38,606
My God.

355
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:42,944
Why me?

356
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:46,573
As a xenobiologist, your skills are
specifically suited to the task.

357
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:47,824
Beyond that...

358
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,743
...I'm not at liberty to tell you.

359
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,788
Hello.

360
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:30,366
The eyes, nose, ears and mouth
are humanoid.

361
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:34,829
In the left anterior thoracic region
is a 10-centimeter wound...

362
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:38,625
...with jagged edges containing attached
cyanotic-colored coagulum.

363
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,543
Okay, all right.

364
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:43,379
Place the ring, then speak the oath.

365
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,550
The oath.

366
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:50,053
Because everybody knows the oath.

367
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:52,889
Used to sing it in camp.

368
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:59,562
I, Hal Jordan...

369
00:40:00,105 --> 00:40:02,357
...do solemnly swear...

370
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:05,401
...to pledge allegiance...

371
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:07,320
...to a lantern...

372
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:11,324
...that I got from a dying purple alien...

373
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:13,493
...in a swamp.

374
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:15,578
The epidermis is magenta.

375
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:18,623
It appears transparent
and is extremely thin...

376
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:24,045
...allowing visualization of muscles
and individual muscle fibers.

377
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:28,216
"To infinity and beyond."

378
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:31,094
"By the power of Grayskull."

379
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:32,762
What the hell?!

380
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:36,599
If you can fly me 100 miles in the middle
of nowhere, you'd think that you...

381
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,768
No!

382
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:54,701
In brightest day, in blackest night...

383
00:40:55,035 --> 00:40:57,996
...no evil shall escape my sight.

384
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:01,624
Let those who worship evil's might...

385
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:08,631
...beware my power:

386
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:10,800
Green Lantern's light.

387
00:41:30,487 --> 00:41:31,821
Carol.

388
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:35,074
- Everything okay in there?
- It's fine.

389
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:36,910
Well, can I come in?

390
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:38,161
No.

391
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:40,914
Yeah, no, because we're...
Uh, do you wanna get a drink?

392
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:43,124
- Can we talk?
- Yeah.

393
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:45,919
We can talk and drink.

394
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:58,890
- My initial analysis.
- Thank you, doctor.

395
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:04,646
I don't need to tell you that the mere fact
that it's humanoid is extraordinary.

396
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:09,817
It's indicating a convergent evolution,
or perhaps a common ancestry...

397
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:13,363
...and the implications of that
are staggering.

398
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:16,115
I mean, where did it come from?

399
00:42:16,283 --> 00:42:19,535
This could completely change the way
that the world views itself.

400
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:22,789
You imagine the way that the public
will react to this?

401
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:26,626
Um, but I know that
that won't happen. I do.

402
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:29,796
Like yourself, doctor,
I'm a seeker of truth.

403
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:32,507
But the people who pay for facilities
like this...

404
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:35,385
...have other priorities
and the power to enforce them.

405
00:42:35,552 --> 00:42:37,387
So I keep it a secret.

406
00:42:37,554 --> 00:42:40,223
People like us have to work
within the system, doctor.

407
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:43,017
We do the best we can.

408
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:46,229
Right.

409
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:50,775
Pick that up.

410
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:55,071
I, um...

411
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:57,156
I'm really sorry.

412
00:42:57,908 --> 00:42:59,951
Did you just apologize?

413
00:43:00,577 --> 00:43:03,830
You haven't been replaced by an alien
or something?

414
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:05,665
No.

415
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,333
I'm good.

416
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:10,086
Ah. I'm good.

417
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:13,089
I'm good, totally good. Uh...

418
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:17,760
Do you think I'm irresponsible?

419
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:25,059
No need to answer. That's fine.

420
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:27,478
Hal. Ha, ha.

421
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:33,901
You look pretty.

422
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:40,616
And we haven't been in this place
together since...

423
00:43:41,618 --> 00:43:42,744
...that night.

424
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:46,456
- You forgot it was my birthday.
- Did I?

425
00:43:46,623 --> 00:43:47,957
Mm.

426
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:51,794
That was also the night...
The first time that we ever...

427
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:54,922
...flew together.

428
00:43:57,634 --> 00:44:00,887
You've been flying ever since
with anyone who'd get in the plane.

429
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:09,479
Oh, yeah.

430
00:44:09,938 --> 00:44:11,314
- Oh, no.
- Come on.

431
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:12,982
- No, yeah, let's go.
Mm-mm.

432
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:15,651
- Dance with me.
- No.

433
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:24,243
No.

434
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:26,329
Hal. No.

435
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:30,958
No.

436
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:38,341
I really am sorry.

437
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:42,386
Oh. It's okay.
The contract isn't quite dead yet.

438
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:43,971
I told you I was good at this.

439
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:46,682
I wasn't talking about the contract.

440
00:44:49,978 --> 00:44:54,273
I would've screwed this up. You know?

441
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:57,485
Even if I didn't go to the Air Force...

442
00:44:58,487 --> 00:45:00,822
...I would've found some way to...

443
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:04,617
- You and me, I would've blown it.
- Yeah, is that what you tell yourself?

444
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:06,994
Mm. What do you tell yourself?

445
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:13,334
That you were scared
I was getting too close.

446
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,465
You know what I spent
my afternoon doing?

447
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:21,092
What?

448
00:45:21,426 --> 00:45:23,427
Worrying about you.

449
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:29,851
I went over every inch of the flight data.
There was nothing wrong with the plane.

450
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:33,521
- What happened up there?
- Thanks for the dance.

451
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:04,093
I told you to watch your back.

452
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:07,555
You cost us all our jobs,
you son of a bitch.

453
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:28,451
Pathetic.

454
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:32,455
Bastard's been living off his old man's
reputation his whole life.

455
00:46:38,503 --> 00:46:39,962
Hey.

456
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:42,381
Hey!

457
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:45,551
My face is just getting warmed up.

458
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:36,824
Whoa.

459
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:56,802
Have you concluded admiring yourself?

460
00:50:56,970 --> 00:50:58,470
Uh...

461
00:50:58,638 --> 00:50:59,805
Yeah.

462
00:50:59,973 --> 00:51:03,767
Well, your ring translator
is functioning properly.

463
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:07,146
Your mask will appear when protection
of your identity is required.

464
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:09,023
There is no need for it on Oa.

465
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:11,066
A talking fish.

466
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:12,902
Actually, my race is Xudarian.

467
00:51:13,069 --> 00:51:16,572
Our DNA does somewhat resemble
your own ichthyological species.

468
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:20,993
I am Tomar-Re, protector of Sector 2813
and home to...

469
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:25,664
80,012 galaxies,
2.34 million sentient species.

470
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:27,625
How do I know that?

471
00:51:27,792 --> 00:51:29,418
The induction process.

472
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:34,048
It activates the ring's higher functions,
including a working knowledge base.

473
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:35,424
In truth, we were curious.

474
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:40,095
The process had never been attempted on
a species as young as humans before.

475
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:47,269
As you are the first to be chosen,
I've been sent to welcome you here.

476
00:51:48,563 --> 00:51:50,981
And here is?

477
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:57,029
Welcome to Oa.

478
00:52:01,409 --> 00:52:04,954
This planet has been our home
for countless millennia.

479
00:52:05,121 --> 00:52:08,123
It was created for us by the Guardians.

480
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:09,959
Guardians?

481
00:52:10,126 --> 00:52:11,919
There stands their Citadel.

482
00:52:12,545 --> 00:52:15,714
They are immortals,
among the most ancient of races.

483
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:20,135
They made all you see
and are responsible for all we are and do.

484
00:52:20,887 --> 00:52:23,305
Since time immemorial,
the Green Lantern Corps...

485
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:28,310
...has served as the keepers of peace,
order and justice throughout the universe.

486
00:52:28,728 --> 00:52:32,564
To be chosen to join its ranks
is the highest of honors...

487
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:35,067
...and the greatest of responsibilities.

488
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:37,736
Yeah. Yeah, that part I heard about.

489
00:52:38,446 --> 00:52:39,738
We're going to fly now.

490
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:44,118
- Fly?
- Absolutely.

491
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:46,912
All right.

492
00:52:47,622 --> 00:52:49,665
I can do that.

493
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:56,130
Join me.

494
00:52:57,799 --> 00:52:59,675
I can do that.

495
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:13,439
Yeah!

496
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:17,735
Whoa!

497
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:50,267
What is that?

498
00:53:50,435 --> 00:53:53,354
It's the energy
that's generated from the Central Battery.

499
00:53:53,521 --> 00:53:57,024
Its power comes from the will
of every living creature in the universe.

500
00:53:57,442 --> 00:54:02,404
It, in turn, charges your lantern,
which, in turn, charges your ring.

501
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:05,991
Even your suit is comprised
entirely of energy.

502
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:07,743
What's with all the green?

503
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:09,370
Green is the color of will.

504
00:54:09,537 --> 00:54:11,080
The Guardians harnessed will...

505
00:54:11,247 --> 00:54:14,541
...because it's the strongest
source of energy in the universe.

506
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:20,422
There's so many.

507
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:24,218
The stars you can see from
your home planet on the clearest night...

508
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:26,428
...your sector is a thousand times larger.

509
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:32,726
And 3600 Lanterns,
each with a sector just as vast.

510
00:54:56,709 --> 00:55:00,087
Lanterns, I've called you here
to this unprecedented gathering...

511
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:03,549
...because we face
an unprecedented danger.

512
00:55:05,176 --> 00:55:09,555
Our four Lantern brothers
were killed by an enemy called Parallax.

513
00:55:10,723 --> 00:55:14,143
An enemy we don't yet fully understand.

514
00:55:14,602 --> 00:55:19,273
We do know it's powerful enough
to destroy entire civilizations.

515
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:24,611
Powerful enough
to defeat even Abin Sur...

516
00:55:25,071 --> 00:55:27,197
...our finest warrior...

517
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:30,784
...whose light can never be replaced.

518
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:39,585
The Guardians have charged me
to lead a squadron of Lanterns...

519
00:55:39,752 --> 00:55:41,503
...in an assault on Parallax.

520
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:45,382
We will seek out and find this enemy.

521
00:55:46,801 --> 00:55:49,011
And we will destroy it.

522
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:53,515
Alone, we are now vulnerable.

523
00:55:53,766 --> 00:55:57,269
United, we are still invincible.

524
00:55:58,021 --> 00:55:59,855
We have never been defeated.

525
00:56:00,273 --> 00:56:02,149
Will we be defeated now?

526
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:03,484
No!

527
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:08,989
It was for this moment
that we were created.

528
00:56:09,157 --> 00:56:12,284
But I don't need to tell you your duty.

529
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:15,454
I don't need to tell you who we are.

530
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:22,878
We are the Corps! We are the Corps!

531
00:56:23,796 --> 00:56:28,175
We are the Corps! We are the Corps!

532
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:35,390
Your will turns thought into reality.

533
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:38,560
To master the ring,
you must learn to focus your will...

534
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:41,772
...and create what you see in your mind.

535
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:47,653
The ring's limits
are only what you can imagine.

536
00:56:52,992 --> 00:56:54,326
Do that again.

537
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:55,744
Now you try.

538
00:56:57,997 --> 00:56:59,164
Concentrate.

539
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:18,767
The ring will inform you
where there is an imminent threat.

540
00:57:22,188 --> 00:57:25,023
This particular threat's name is Kilowog.

541
00:57:25,191 --> 00:57:27,693
He'll be your combat training officer.

542
00:57:28,027 --> 00:57:31,613
- Whoa!
- Never let your guard down, poozer.

543
00:57:32,448 --> 00:57:34,616
Welcome to Ring Slinging 101.

544
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:36,368
Or as I like to call it:

545
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:39,413
The worst day of your worthless life.

546
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:44,918
The human. Ain't never seen one before.

547
00:57:47,505 --> 00:57:49,464
- You smell funny.
- Ugh.

548
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:51,008
I smell funny?

549
00:57:51,175 --> 00:57:54,970
Yeah, I heard about humans.
Think you're the center of the universe.

550
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:56,179
You want to be a Lantern?

551
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:58,765
You gotta commit to the Corps.

552
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:03,895
All right, poozer.
Let's see what you've got.

553
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:20,662
Your constructs are only gonna be
as strong as your will.

554
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:22,331
And your will is pathetic.

555
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:29,379
I'm gonna work you
and I'm gonna hit you...

556
00:58:29,547 --> 00:58:33,008
...until your will is strong enough
to be worthy of the Corps.

557
00:58:46,022 --> 00:58:47,356
Next lesson.

558
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,527
Ha, ha. Feel that?

559
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:55,322
It's the gravitational pull
of your average sun.

560
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:58,950
Makes flying through space
very dangerous.

561
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:02,287
The bigger you are,
the quicker you burn.

562
00:59:04,832 --> 00:59:06,875
Gravity's a bitch.

563
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:11,838
Here, let me help you.

564
00:59:14,550 --> 00:59:19,388
Remember, your enemy,
he's not gonna play fair.

565
00:59:25,895 --> 00:59:28,855
Well, that's good advice.
Thanks, gorgeous.

566
00:59:29,023 --> 00:59:30,482
So...

567
00:59:32,026 --> 00:59:33,819
...this is the human.

568
00:59:34,570 --> 00:59:37,072
When I learned Abin Sur's ring
had chosen you...

569
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,740
...I said there had to be a mistake.

570
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:43,870
I see nothing to change my mind.

571
00:59:44,497 --> 00:59:46,206
I'll take it from here, Kilowog.

572
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:50,585
The Corps is only as strong
as its weakest link.

573
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:53,839
And I will tolerate no weak links.

574
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:55,716
You understand me?

575
00:59:57,552 --> 01:00:00,220
Are you afraid, human?

576
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:04,182
Are you afraid?

577
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:05,392
Don't.

578
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:09,229
Don't do that.

579
01:00:13,651 --> 01:00:14,943
Shall we?

580
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:19,114
Sure.

581
01:00:20,158 --> 01:00:21,867
A sword?

582
01:00:22,034 --> 01:00:23,869
How human.

583
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:36,506
I do believe I smell fear.

584
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:43,638
I'm a Green Lantern.

585
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:47,726
I fear nothing.

586
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:51,897
Fear is the enemy of will.

587
01:00:52,064 --> 01:00:53,899
Will is what makes you take action.

588
01:00:57,445 --> 01:01:01,072
Fear is what stops you
and makes you weak.

589
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:08,914
Makes your constructs feeble.

590
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:22,260
You must ignore your fear.
When you're afraid, you can't act.

591
01:01:22,428 --> 01:01:25,972
When you can't act, you can't defend.
If you can't defend, you die.

592
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:33,021
You reek of fear, Hal Jordan.

593
01:01:33,606 --> 01:01:35,273
Abin Sur was a great warrior.

594
01:01:35,733 --> 01:01:37,526
My mentor.

595
01:01:37,818 --> 01:01:39,402
My friend.

596
01:01:39,987 --> 01:01:44,074
You insult his memory
by wearing his ring.

597
01:02:01,884 --> 01:02:05,512
I'm done. He's right. I'm only human.
We're not ready to defend the universe.

598
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:08,723
A few days ago, we thought we were
the only ones in the universe.

599
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:12,561
The ring chose you. It wouldn't have
if it hadn't seen something in you.

600
01:02:12,728 --> 01:02:13,770
Oh, yeah?

601
01:02:13,938 --> 01:02:16,147
Something you yourself don't yet see.

602
01:02:16,315 --> 01:02:18,233
The ring never makes a mistake.

603
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:20,902
This time it did.

604
01:03:09,076 --> 01:03:11,411
That until recently, we didn't realize...

605
01:03:11,579 --> 01:03:16,458
...that many of these little critters that we've
been calling bacteria weren't bacteria at all.

606
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:21,463
They were an entirely different type
of primitive prokaryotic cell.

607
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:25,592
These little buggers, called archaeans,
are still poorly understood.

608
01:03:28,346 --> 01:03:29,512
Um...

609
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:32,724
But might turn out to be
different from bacteria...

610
01:03:36,062 --> 01:03:40,273
But might turn out to be as different
from bacteria as bacteria is from us.

611
01:03:40,441 --> 01:03:41,650
Some call them extremophiles...

612
01:03:43,152 --> 01:03:46,613
...because they live in the most extreme
environments on Earth, such as...

613
01:03:46,781 --> 01:03:48,907
God, he's so boring.

614
01:03:49,075 --> 01:03:50,742
...The boiling waters of a geyser.

615
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:52,327
What a loser.

616
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:55,121
- Michael!
- Huh?

617
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:57,123
What did you say?

618
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,167
I didn't say anything.

619
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:03,922
Did you just call me a loser?

620
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:06,174
What kind of freak is this guy?

621
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:07,967
"Freak"?!

622
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:28,196
Class dismissed.

623
01:05:10,573 --> 01:05:12,407
So how you been?

624
01:05:12,825 --> 01:05:14,576
Been a while.

625
01:05:15,828 --> 01:05:18,913
So you had a rough night last night.
Did you get her name, huh?

626
01:05:21,959 --> 01:05:24,461
You need to get some sleep, son.

627
01:05:25,004 --> 01:05:28,006
- Have a seat.
- What can I do for you, Dad?

628
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:30,592
Well, actually, you've already done it.

629
01:05:31,177 --> 01:05:32,927
For me and for your country.

630
01:05:33,429 --> 01:05:34,929
What are you talking about?

631
01:05:35,097 --> 01:05:40,268
I'm talking about you impressing
a whole lot of very important people.

632
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:44,230
Where did you get that?

633
01:05:44,398 --> 01:05:47,942
I'm on a subcommittee
overseeing the agencies involved.

634
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:53,114
- Top-secret, of course.
- It was you. That's why they chose me.

635
01:05:53,449 --> 01:05:57,368
Because of this, we're gonna be able
to get you a top post on the inside now...

636
01:05:57,536 --> 01:05:59,204
...helping to oversee the operation.

637
01:05:59,371 --> 01:06:03,958
There are scientists
that worked their whole lives for this.

638
01:06:04,126 --> 01:06:06,127
- Mm-hm.
- People more qualified.

639
01:06:06,295 --> 01:06:07,587
And less connected.

640
01:06:07,755 --> 01:06:11,382
Don't be naive, son.
It's the way the world works.

641
01:06:11,675 --> 01:06:15,053
You have to seize an opportunity
when it presents itself.

642
01:06:17,807 --> 01:06:19,599
He'll never get it.

643
01:06:19,767 --> 01:06:20,809
Just wasting his life away.

644
01:06:22,186 --> 01:06:23,645
What an embarrassment.

645
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:28,817
Bill! Ha. How are you?

646
01:06:28,984 --> 01:06:30,652
I'm terrific.

647
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:34,739
No, no, no. Just finishing up a meeting.
Got plenty of time.

648
01:07:34,049 --> 01:07:38,303
With my own eyes I saw this creature
induce fear in our finest warriors...

649
01:07:38,470 --> 01:07:40,597
...and then feed on that fear.

650
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:42,807
There's more.

651
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:46,978
We've tracked its trajectory.
Parallax is headed for Oa.

652
01:07:47,479 --> 01:07:49,814
Never before has an enemy
dared attack us here.

653
01:07:49,982 --> 01:07:52,233
You must tell me what you know.

654
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:57,155
Will has always been our sole weapon...

655
01:07:57,323 --> 01:08:00,033
...against the forces of darkness
in the universe.

656
01:08:00,534 --> 01:08:04,078
But as that power began to seem
insufficient...

657
01:08:04,246 --> 01:08:06,748
...a great debate arose among us.

658
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:09,334
Should we exploit
another source of power...

659
01:08:09,668 --> 01:08:13,671
...one we had long since sworn
should never be used?

660
01:08:14,256 --> 01:08:15,757
Fear.

661
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:19,594
But the power of fear
was too unpredictable.

662
01:08:19,762 --> 01:08:22,430
The chance of corruption too great.

663
01:08:22,598 --> 01:08:25,016
And so we decided against it.

664
01:08:25,184 --> 01:08:29,187
All of us, that is, except one.

665
01:08:29,897 --> 01:08:33,650
Alone, this Guardian
entered the forbidden chamber.

666
01:08:33,817 --> 01:08:37,779
He wanted to prove the light of fear
could be mastered.

667
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:40,782
His intentions were pure...

668
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:44,035
...but his hopes were naive.

669
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:47,747
Consumed by the yellow power of fear...

670
01:08:47,915 --> 01:08:52,460
...the Guardian became the very evil
he had wished to destroy.

671
01:08:52,628 --> 01:08:54,712
He became Parallax.

672
01:09:02,304 --> 01:09:05,223
For the universe's safety and his own...

673
01:09:05,391 --> 01:09:09,644
...Abin Sur was charged with
imprisoning Parallax in the Lost Sector.

674
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:11,187
But he escaped.

675
01:09:11,355 --> 01:09:15,316
Feeding on the fear of others,
he grew larger, more powerful.

676
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:16,651
And is now headed here...

677
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:20,154
...to take his revenge on you
and destroy the Corps.

678
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:29,163
Then we have no choice.

679
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:33,584
We must prepare to harness the power
of our enemy and fight fear with fear.

680
01:09:33,752 --> 01:09:36,921
To protect our sectors,
we must be able to defend ourselves.

681
01:09:38,132 --> 01:09:40,883
We must forge a yellow ring.

682
01:09:49,685 --> 01:09:50,685
Watch your step.

683
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:52,520
- Senator.
- Senator.

684
01:09:52,688 --> 01:09:55,606
Don't have to worry about me no more

685
01:09:55,774 --> 01:09:58,985
I'm gone

686
01:09:59,737 --> 01:10:03,781
I'm gone, I'm gone

687
01:10:06,326 --> 01:10:07,368
Hello.

688
01:10:07,536 --> 01:10:08,786
Hi.

689
01:10:13,709 --> 01:10:16,335
Everybody get on your feet

690
01:10:17,546 --> 01:10:19,797
You make me nervous
When you're in your seat

691
01:10:20,966 --> 01:10:22,050
Rough night, huh?

692
01:10:23,886 --> 01:10:25,136
Hector.

693
01:10:26,221 --> 01:10:28,056
How you doing?
What have you been up to?

694
01:10:28,223 --> 01:10:30,850
- Same old, same old.
- Yeah. Me too.

695
01:10:31,018 --> 01:10:35,897
Hal Jordan. Worst pilot I've ever seen.
Or the best. Not quite sure.

696
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:37,231
I've been called both.

697
01:10:37,399 --> 01:10:40,902
- Glad you could make it, son.
- I was a little surprised I got the invite.

698
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:42,236
No, you're family, Hal.

699
01:10:42,404 --> 01:10:45,114
There are thinkers in this world
and there are doers.

700
01:10:45,282 --> 01:10:47,075
And you are one of the doers.

701
01:10:48,869 --> 01:10:51,370
Yeah, but the thinkers
make what I do possible.

702
01:10:51,538 --> 01:10:53,915
Wouldn't have a plane
unless someone thought it up.

703
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:55,458
Of course.

704
01:10:55,667 --> 01:10:57,585
Excuse me, I need a drink.

705
01:10:59,254 --> 01:11:02,090
- I gotta get back to work. This is work.
- Yes, sir.

706
01:11:02,257 --> 01:11:04,926
- Nice to see you, son.
- You too. You too.

707
01:11:11,558 --> 01:11:13,392
Nice.

708
01:11:15,270 --> 01:11:18,147
Yeah, my dad used to train in it.

709
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:21,859
I was talking about your dress.

710
01:11:24,279 --> 01:11:26,072
Nice jacket.

711
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:28,407
Last time I checked,
you didn't even own one.

712
01:11:28,575 --> 01:11:31,285
Yeah, I've been shaking up
the wardrobe lately.

713
01:11:31,453 --> 01:11:34,956
Congratulations on the contract.
How'd you manage to pull that off?

714
01:11:35,124 --> 01:11:38,459
I pointed out you only won because you
broke the rules of engagement.

715
01:11:38,669 --> 01:11:41,796
And Tom figured out
how to give the Sabres more altitude.

716
01:11:41,964 --> 01:11:45,258
So I guess in a way,
without even meaning to...

717
01:11:45,425 --> 01:11:47,135
...you actually did us a favor.

718
01:11:48,929 --> 01:11:50,304
Look...

719
01:11:51,473 --> 01:11:53,516
...I'm uncomfortable
with the word "hero."

720
01:11:53,684 --> 01:11:55,309
Hey

721
01:12:02,192 --> 01:12:04,485
Thank you. Thank you all for joining us.

722
01:12:04,653 --> 01:12:05,820
Great evening.

723
01:12:05,988 --> 01:12:10,241
Somebody very special I'd like to thank
for helping us to nail this contract:

724
01:12:10,951 --> 01:12:13,327
My daughter, Carol Ferris.

725
01:12:13,495 --> 01:12:14,495
Come on!

726
01:12:24,256 --> 01:12:26,048
Congratulations, Carol.

727
01:12:26,216 --> 01:12:28,301
I take one look at you, young lady...

728
01:12:28,468 --> 01:12:30,845
...or at Hal Jordan over there,
spitting image of his dad...

729
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:33,014
- Whoo!
- You give us hope.

730
01:12:33,432 --> 01:12:35,183
A toast to our future.

731
01:12:35,350 --> 01:12:37,185
- Hear, hear!
- To the future!

732
01:12:37,352 --> 01:12:38,436
We're in good hands.

733
01:12:54,912 --> 01:12:57,705
Hector! Oh, my God! Hey!

734
01:13:03,003 --> 01:13:05,546
- Congratulations. Um...
- Thank you.

735
01:13:05,714 --> 01:13:09,300
Here's to you and Hal, the future.

736
01:13:10,052 --> 01:13:13,346
Yeah, heh, I'm sorry.

737
01:13:13,764 --> 01:13:17,475
I know it couldn't have been easy
growing up with your dad.

738
01:13:17,643 --> 01:13:20,645
But, hey, you're doing great, so... Ha, ha.

739
01:13:20,812 --> 01:13:22,563
I am. I'm doing great. Ha, ha.

740
01:13:22,731 --> 01:13:25,399
- He's right, though. I'm not a doer.
- Ha, ha.

741
01:13:25,567 --> 01:13:28,236
Although I did get to examine
an alien body recently.

742
01:13:28,403 --> 01:13:29,946
That was very cool.

743
01:13:30,113 --> 01:13:33,699
I can't tell anyone about it,
but, hey, you can't have everything.

744
01:13:33,867 --> 01:13:36,118
Hector telling you another
of his science-fiction stories?

745
01:13:36,286 --> 01:13:38,287
What the hell's wrong with him?

746
01:13:38,455 --> 01:13:40,248
Can't keep his mouth shut.

747
01:13:40,832 --> 01:13:43,251
You really do have
a creative imagination.

748
01:13:43,418 --> 01:13:44,752
Bye.

749
01:13:45,045 --> 01:13:46,087
Senator.

750
01:13:46,588 --> 01:13:49,257
I apologize. We really must go.

751
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:52,343
- Good night, Carol.
- Good night.

752
01:13:55,931 --> 01:13:56,931
Senator!

753
01:13:57,266 --> 01:13:58,808
Hey.

754
01:13:59,643 --> 01:14:00,768
Thanks for everything.

755
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:13,072
Bye, senator!

756
01:14:38,932 --> 01:14:42,310
Get the crash crew here.
Our helicopter's going down.

757
01:14:52,612 --> 01:14:53,738
Oh, my God.

758
01:16:01,848 --> 01:16:04,308
What is that? What is that?

759
01:17:27,809 --> 01:17:30,811
What happened tonight took place
in just a matter of seconds...

760
01:17:30,979 --> 01:17:33,647
...but people will be talking about it
for years to come.

761
01:17:33,815 --> 01:17:37,735
A helicopter careening out of control,
headed toward certain tragedy...

762
01:17:37,903 --> 01:17:42,072
...when all of a sudden, a mystery man,
a hero, saves the day...

763
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:45,826
...incredibly diverting the helicopter
from destroying innocent people...

764
01:17:46,036 --> 01:17:50,331
...and miraculously rescuing Carol Ferris.

765
01:17:50,790 --> 01:17:56,003
The real question tonight is who is this
amazing hero and where is he now?

766
01:18:06,348 --> 01:18:08,390
Start talking.

767
01:18:09,559 --> 01:18:11,018
- A racetrack?
- Yeah.

768
01:18:11,186 --> 01:18:12,603
Hmm.

769
01:18:12,771 --> 01:18:16,190
That's the best you could come up with
for your first big appearance? Racetrack.

770
01:18:16,358 --> 01:18:18,526
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I disappoint you?

771
01:18:18,693 --> 01:18:23,322
I materialized a track out of pure energy,
saving hundreds, and you're disappointed.

772
01:18:23,490 --> 01:18:24,615
I'm sorry about that.

773
01:18:24,783 --> 01:18:26,492
No, I wanna see this stuff. Show me.

774
01:18:26,660 --> 01:18:28,202
I don't think that's a good idea.

775
01:18:28,370 --> 01:18:29,912
Come on, I wanna see this stuff.

776
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:32,706
I wanna see the outfit, the flying...
You gotta show me.

777
01:18:32,874 --> 01:18:34,750
Hal, being your best friend's no picnic.

778
01:18:34,918 --> 01:18:37,169
- It's for emergencies!
- You owe me!

779
01:18:37,963 --> 01:18:40,631
Hal, I wanna see it.

780
01:18:41,841 --> 01:18:42,883
Fine.

781
01:18:44,219 --> 01:18:45,678
Hold on to your glasses.

782
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:49,640
All right.

783
01:18:49,808 --> 01:18:51,308
Question:

784
01:18:52,394 --> 01:18:55,145
- You ready to have your mind blown?
- Yeah.

785
01:18:56,064 --> 01:18:57,273
Ring.

786
01:18:57,440 --> 01:18:59,024
Finger.

787
01:19:09,536 --> 01:19:10,703
Here we go.

788
01:19:18,253 --> 01:19:21,463
- Did you break it already?
- I didn't break it, okay? It's just...

789
01:19:21,631 --> 01:19:24,383
It's out of juice. I have to recharge it.

790
01:19:34,644 --> 01:19:36,478
Now pay attention.

791
01:19:39,774 --> 01:19:41,442
Aah! Green!

792
01:19:44,112 --> 01:19:46,614
- Wow.
- I know, right?!

793
01:19:49,451 --> 01:19:50,951
Whoo!

794
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:55,247
Not bad, huh?

795
01:19:55,415 --> 01:19:57,583
You're a superhero.

796
01:20:05,884 --> 01:20:07,801
Don't they always get the girl?

797
01:20:36,790 --> 01:20:38,415
Evening, ma'am.

798
01:20:39,084 --> 01:20:41,710
Didn't get a chance to say goodbye.

799
01:20:42,337 --> 01:20:44,046
Are you okay?

800
01:20:44,214 --> 01:20:47,675
Uh, yeah, no,
I'm glad to have a chance to thank you.

801
01:20:47,842 --> 01:20:50,594
Just doing my job.
No thanks necessary, miss.

802
01:20:51,012 --> 01:20:52,846
No, it is.

803
01:20:53,598 --> 01:20:55,474
You saved my life.

804
01:20:55,850 --> 01:20:59,019
You saved all of our lives.
That was a very...

805
01:21:06,277 --> 01:21:07,444
Hal?

806
01:21:07,862 --> 01:21:09,029
Miss?

807
01:21:09,197 --> 01:21:10,614
Hal?!

808
01:21:11,366 --> 01:21:14,034
Oh, my Go... Oh, my God!

809
01:21:14,244 --> 01:21:16,870
- Oh, my God! Hal!
- How did you know it was me?

810
01:21:17,038 --> 01:21:19,790
What? I've known you my whole life!
I've seen you naked!

811
01:21:19,958 --> 01:21:22,876
You don't think I would recognize you
because I can't see your cheekbones?!

812
01:21:23,044 --> 01:21:26,797
What is this?! Why is your skin green?
Why are you glowing?

813
01:21:26,965 --> 01:21:28,674
What the hell is with that mask?!

814
01:21:29,259 --> 01:21:30,384
It came with the outfit.

815
01:21:32,721 --> 01:21:34,012
Cool, huh?

816
01:21:35,348 --> 01:21:38,559
So it all works
because of this magic ring? Ha, ha.

817
01:21:38,727 --> 01:21:41,395
No, there's no such thing as magic.

818
01:21:41,563 --> 01:21:44,189
Intergalactic green peacekeepers,
thousands of them.

819
01:21:44,357 --> 01:21:46,650
- Ha, ha.
- But, no.

820
01:21:46,901 --> 01:21:48,026
I'm not making it up.

821
01:21:50,572 --> 01:21:53,031
I mean, when we were kids,
who'd have thought?

822
01:21:53,658 --> 01:21:57,161
- I did, actually. I called this early on.
- Ha-ha-ha.

823
01:21:57,328 --> 01:22:01,373
I said, "One day I'll be a
green space cop." Here I am.

824
01:22:03,168 --> 01:22:06,587
Okay, so at the party, how did you
make that big green ramp thing?

825
01:22:07,338 --> 01:22:10,674
Anything I see in my mind, I can create.
I just have to focus.

826
01:22:11,342 --> 01:22:12,426
Anything?

827
01:22:13,428 --> 01:22:14,678
Anything.

828
01:22:29,903 --> 01:22:33,030
Happy birthday. Better late than never.

829
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:35,282
Um...

830
01:22:36,284 --> 01:22:37,951
Okay, so how does it work?

831
01:22:38,119 --> 01:22:43,415
They just, um, call you on your cell,
"Cat in a tree, downtown Milky Way"?

832
01:22:43,583 --> 01:22:46,627
No. I don't think it works
exactly like that.

833
01:22:46,795 --> 01:22:49,379
Well, technically speaking, um...

834
01:22:49,631 --> 01:22:51,799
...I actually sort of, uh...

835
01:22:52,842 --> 01:22:54,092
...quit.

836
01:22:54,260 --> 01:22:55,469
What do you mean? How?

837
01:22:55,637 --> 01:22:59,139
Well, I mean, it's a lot like quitting
anything else, really.

838
01:22:59,766 --> 01:23:00,974
I don't understand.

839
01:23:01,142 --> 01:23:03,435
How do you walk away
from something like that?

840
01:23:03,603 --> 01:23:04,812
Is that even possible?

841
01:23:04,979 --> 01:23:08,440
Oh, I think we both know
I'm pretty good at walking away.

842
01:23:13,363 --> 01:23:16,824
If for once you didn't quit something
you cared about...

843
01:23:16,991 --> 01:23:19,243
...what's the worst that could happen?

844
01:23:36,636 --> 01:23:38,846
Well, thank you.
This has been really something.

845
01:23:39,013 --> 01:23:42,391
- I know I've made a lot of mistakes...
- Look, Hal, I'm not mad at you.

846
01:23:43,309 --> 01:23:45,519
I feel bad for you, really.

847
01:23:45,854 --> 01:23:48,689
You've been given so much so often.

848
01:23:49,524 --> 01:23:51,024
And you just...

849
01:23:55,363 --> 01:23:56,238
Good night.

850
01:24:49,459 --> 01:24:50,500
Dr. Hammond?

851
01:24:52,837 --> 01:24:55,714
There is something I'd like to show you.

852
01:24:55,882 --> 01:24:59,301
Something I'm fairly certain
you'll want to see.

853
01:25:07,602 --> 01:25:08,894
See you later, Mom.

854
01:25:09,062 --> 01:25:10,729
- I love you.
- Bye, baby.

855
01:25:12,482 --> 01:25:14,358
No!

856
01:25:17,445 --> 01:25:21,782
Physical contact
accesses mnemonic data.

857
01:25:22,450 --> 01:25:25,202
I can see your memories.

858
01:26:01,614 --> 01:26:02,656
Dad.

859
01:26:04,325 --> 01:26:06,660
Son, this is my fault.

860
01:26:07,495 --> 01:26:09,246
But I'm gonna fix it.

861
01:26:10,164 --> 01:26:13,625
We're gonna get you well again.
Whatever it takes.

862
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:18,171
I don't know what you're talking about.

863
01:26:18,339 --> 01:26:20,757
We detected traces
of a second alien life form...

864
01:26:20,925 --> 01:26:23,009
...buried within the body of the first.

865
01:26:23,177 --> 01:26:25,512
You've been exposed.

866
01:26:25,847 --> 01:26:30,809
I've never felt better in my life.

867
01:26:31,561 --> 01:26:33,937
We know everything, son.

868
01:26:34,689 --> 01:26:37,023
I've never felt better in my life.

869
01:26:57,378 --> 01:27:01,131
To be chosen to join its ranks
is the highest of honors...

870
01:27:01,299 --> 01:27:03,842
...and the greatest of responsibilities.

871
01:27:04,051 --> 01:27:06,553
The ring never makes a mistake.

872
01:27:31,579 --> 01:27:33,246
It's gonna be all right.

873
01:27:33,414 --> 01:27:35,832
They just need to run some tests,
that's all.

874
01:27:41,172 --> 01:27:42,672
Keep him under.

875
01:27:45,927 --> 01:27:48,053
I only want what's best for you.

876
01:28:06,781 --> 01:28:08,031
Run.

877
01:28:43,109 --> 01:28:44,943
- Hector.
- Shh, shh.

878
01:28:45,111 --> 01:28:46,653
Don't worry.

879
01:28:48,489 --> 01:28:50,490
I only want what's best for you.

880
01:30:12,657 --> 01:30:15,158
The ring, it chose you.

881
01:30:15,326 --> 01:30:16,868
Take it!

882
01:30:18,663 --> 01:30:19,996
Hal.

883
01:30:20,873 --> 01:30:22,666
Hi.

884
01:30:25,586 --> 01:30:28,421
The alien was one of you.

885
01:30:30,383 --> 01:30:32,926
How did we end up so different?

886
01:30:33,094 --> 01:30:34,844
Hmm? Hmm?

887
01:30:35,012 --> 01:30:36,638
Sit down!

888
01:30:38,933 --> 01:30:40,183
Now...

889
01:30:42,395 --> 01:30:43,603
...how's Carol?

890
01:30:45,773 --> 01:30:47,232
- That came out wrong.
- Please.

891
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:49,275
- I've made mistakes...
- Look, Hal...

892
01:30:49,443 --> 01:30:51,903
I feel bad for you, really. Good night.

893
01:30:57,743 --> 01:31:01,997
You're just as much of a failure
as I was.

894
01:31:03,290 --> 01:31:04,958
And just as afraid.

895
01:31:06,168 --> 01:31:08,586
Well...

896
01:31:09,296 --> 01:31:11,548
...I used to fight my fear.

897
01:31:15,302 --> 01:31:19,472
But now that I've tasted its true power...

898
01:31:23,060 --> 01:31:25,145
...I'll never go back.

899
01:31:33,654 --> 01:31:35,613
No!

900
01:31:55,301 --> 01:31:58,928
You wear the ring of the Lantern
that imprisoned me.

901
01:31:59,847 --> 01:32:02,307
You will suffer the same fate.

902
01:32:02,475 --> 01:32:05,810
Once I have devoured your world...

903
01:32:05,978 --> 01:32:08,313
...I will have all the strength I need...

904
01:32:08,481 --> 01:32:12,358
...to defeat the Corps
and destroy the Guardians.

905
01:32:44,725 --> 01:32:46,059
Let me get this straight.

906
01:32:46,227 --> 01:32:49,604
This thing that's out there attacking
planets is connected to Hector?

907
01:32:49,772 --> 01:32:52,357
Somehow it infected him
after it killed Abin Sur.

908
01:32:52,525 --> 01:32:56,736
- Well, you're just gonna have to stop it.
- Oh, I'm just gonna have to stop it, huh?

909
01:32:56,904 --> 01:32:58,571
Well, I tried that and I failed.

910
01:32:58,739 --> 01:33:02,075
And the senator died.
I told you, the ring made a mistake.

911
01:33:02,243 --> 01:33:04,911
Wait, go back.
How did the ring make a mistake?

912
01:33:05,079 --> 01:33:10,041
The one thing that a Green Lantern
is supposed to be is fearless.

913
01:33:10,584 --> 01:33:13,711
Fearless is the job description.

914
01:33:14,338 --> 01:33:15,380
That isn't me.

915
01:33:15,548 --> 01:33:17,924
So you're just gonna walk away again?

916
01:33:18,092 --> 01:33:22,011
Explain this to me, Hal.
Please explain to me just once, why.

917
01:33:22,179 --> 01:33:23,930
Because I'm afraid!

918
01:33:40,739 --> 01:33:42,782
You don't think your dad ever felt afraid?

919
01:33:44,076 --> 01:33:45,910
If he did,
he figured out some way to beat it.

920
01:33:46,078 --> 01:33:48,788
Yeah, well, there's a word for that:

921
01:33:49,123 --> 01:33:50,665
Courage.

922
01:33:57,590 --> 01:34:01,301
They said that the ring wouldn't have
chosen me if it didn't see something.

923
01:34:02,303 --> 01:34:05,597
Something I don't see. Yet.

924
01:34:09,310 --> 01:34:10,685
I see it.

925
01:34:12,021 --> 01:34:13,980
I always have.

926
01:34:14,899 --> 01:34:17,317
The ring didn't see
that you were fearless.

927
01:34:17,484 --> 01:34:20,820
It saw that you had the ability
to overcome fear.

928
01:34:21,572 --> 01:34:23,990
It saw that you're courageous.

929
01:34:27,161 --> 01:34:28,494
Which you are.

930
01:34:29,330 --> 01:34:30,663
Just like your dad.

931
01:34:39,340 --> 01:34:42,050
The Lantern is a threat.

932
01:34:42,927 --> 01:34:45,220
Eliminate him.

933
01:35:19,213 --> 01:35:21,339
Our new weapon is ready.

934
01:35:22,049 --> 01:35:23,716
Once I've mastered its power...

935
01:35:24,385 --> 01:35:27,053
...I'll begin training the Corps
to do the same.

936
01:35:28,389 --> 01:35:30,556
Though Earth will be lost...

937
01:35:30,975 --> 01:35:35,061
...we'll be ready to make a stand against
Parallax before it reaches Oa.

938
01:35:35,229 --> 01:35:36,813
Then the power of the enemy
will be ours.

939
01:35:36,981 --> 01:35:38,815
At what cost?

940
01:35:41,568 --> 01:35:44,237
- You dare enter this chamber?
- I need your help.

941
01:35:45,864 --> 01:35:48,074
You gotta help me save my world.

942
01:35:55,916 --> 01:36:01,087
I know that humans aren't
the strongest species, or the smartest.

943
01:36:02,506 --> 01:36:04,590
We're young, we have a lot to learn.

944
01:36:05,301 --> 01:36:06,592
But we're worth saving.

945
01:36:15,311 --> 01:36:17,603
This new weapon of yours,
you can't use it.

946
01:36:17,813 --> 01:36:21,607
Once you cross that line, once you've given in
to fear, you'll never go back. I've seen it.

947
01:36:23,736 --> 01:36:26,571
Look, I know right now you're afraid.

948
01:36:26,739 --> 01:36:29,073
You dare accuse the Guardians
of feeling fear?

949
01:36:29,241 --> 01:36:30,533
Yes, I do.

950
01:36:30,701 --> 01:36:32,869
That's exactly why Parallax
is beating you...

951
01:36:33,037 --> 01:36:35,621
...because you're afraid
to even admit you're afraid.

952
01:36:35,789 --> 01:36:37,373
I know.

953
01:36:37,791 --> 01:36:39,751
I spent my entire life doing it.

954
01:36:40,961 --> 01:36:43,546
You know, we have a saying on Earth.

955
01:36:43,714 --> 01:36:46,257
We say, "I'm only human."

956
01:36:47,968 --> 01:36:51,596
We say it because we're vulnerable,
we say it because we know we're afraid.

957
01:36:51,764 --> 01:36:53,890
It doesn't mean we're weak.

958
01:36:56,143 --> 01:36:57,602
Help me save my planet.

959
01:36:58,645 --> 01:37:00,063
Don't give in to fear.

960
01:37:00,230 --> 01:37:03,357
Fight it. Fight it with me.

961
01:37:04,610 --> 01:37:06,986
Your words are compelling, young human.

962
01:37:07,154 --> 01:37:10,823
But as immortals, we must measure
our actions over billions of years...

963
01:37:10,991 --> 01:37:13,159
...and the fate of the universe.

964
01:37:13,327 --> 01:37:17,830
We simply cannot risk losing everything
on the chance you might be right.

965
01:37:17,998 --> 01:37:21,125
Then don't. Don't risk any more lives.

966
01:37:22,336 --> 01:37:23,461
Just mine.

967
01:37:25,255 --> 01:37:27,006
Let me go fight for my world...

968
01:37:27,174 --> 01:37:31,385
...and I'll show you
that will is stronger than fear.

969
01:37:32,346 --> 01:37:34,514
There is no way you can succeed.

970
01:37:34,681 --> 01:37:36,891
You will die, Hal Jordan.

971
01:37:38,519 --> 01:37:40,770
Then I'll die trying.

972
01:37:43,357 --> 01:37:45,525
Good luck, Green Lantern.

973
01:38:44,877 --> 01:38:46,419
I wouldn't do that.

974
01:38:49,423 --> 01:38:50,756
Look closely.

975
01:38:55,721 --> 01:38:57,513
She's beautiful, isn't she?

976
01:38:58,765 --> 01:39:01,601
I loved her from the moment
I first saw her.

977
01:39:01,768 --> 01:39:04,937
But she could never see me,
as you were always standing in the way.

978
01:39:05,105 --> 01:39:06,939
But not anymore.

979
01:39:07,566 --> 01:39:10,067
No! No! Don't! Don't do this, Hector.

980
01:39:10,235 --> 01:39:13,779
Please.

981
01:39:14,865 --> 01:39:15,907
I know how you feel.

982
01:39:17,951 --> 01:39:19,952
Come on, look at yourself!

983
01:39:22,623 --> 01:39:24,790
No, I know what it's like...

984
01:39:26,126 --> 01:39:27,960
...to not live up to expectations...

985
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:31,380
...to feel like nothing that you do
will ever be good enough.

986
01:39:35,636 --> 01:39:37,970
I know what it's like to be afraid.

987
01:39:39,097 --> 01:39:40,890
Let me help you.

988
01:39:42,267 --> 01:39:45,144
Hal. You've changed.

989
01:39:46,396 --> 01:39:49,899
How wonderful that all it took for you
to grow up was the end of the world.

990
01:39:51,401 --> 01:39:53,110
Now it's my turn.

991
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:58,449
And if I can't be like you,
I'm gonna make her like me.

992
01:39:58,617 --> 01:40:00,785
And let's face it, once she's like me...

993
01:40:01,578 --> 01:40:03,746
...then you wouldn't be very interested.

994
01:40:03,914 --> 01:40:05,998
Hmm? Now, would you?

995
01:40:07,834 --> 01:40:09,961
- Why can't you?
- Hmm?

996
01:40:11,338 --> 01:40:13,130
Why can't you be like me?

997
01:40:13,298 --> 01:40:15,341
Heh. Huh?

998
01:40:16,593 --> 01:40:17,969
Let her go...

999
01:40:21,348 --> 01:40:22,473
...and you can have it.

1000
01:40:28,188 --> 01:40:30,022
You can do anything.

1001
01:40:30,691 --> 01:40:32,358
Be anything.

1002
01:40:35,028 --> 01:40:36,445
Take it.

1003
01:40:39,741 --> 01:40:41,993
Let her make the choice.

1004
01:40:47,499 --> 01:40:48,958
Okay.

1005
01:41:16,570 --> 01:41:17,903
Wow.

1006
01:41:28,540 --> 01:41:29,915
Now bring her down.

1007
01:41:33,587 --> 01:41:34,754
Hal.

1008
01:41:36,548 --> 01:41:37,590
I lied.

1009
01:41:43,680 --> 01:41:45,222
I lied too.

1010
01:41:45,932 --> 01:41:47,933
See, the way it works is...

1011
01:41:48,101 --> 01:41:49,352
...you have to be chosen.

1012
01:42:30,102 --> 01:42:32,061
You have failed me.

1013
01:43:03,593 --> 01:43:04,844
Stay here.

1014
01:43:05,011 --> 01:43:06,345
No problem.

1015
01:43:33,957 --> 01:43:36,959
Your will is strong,
but not strong enough.

1016
01:43:38,044 --> 01:43:40,880
You are nothing without the ring.

1017
01:44:06,740 --> 01:44:09,241
You must move out of the area now.

1018
01:44:09,409 --> 01:44:11,911
Please clear the streets.

1019
01:44:12,078 --> 01:44:13,871
Clear the streets immediately.

1020
01:44:17,334 --> 01:44:19,585
You can never beat this. You'll die.

1021
01:44:19,753 --> 01:44:21,587
At least I can get it away from here.

1022
01:44:21,755 --> 01:44:24,423
- How do you think you're gonna do that?
- I don't know. I don't know.

1023
01:44:25,842 --> 01:44:28,260
Maybe I can outthink it or...

1024
01:44:28,428 --> 01:44:30,262
The dogfight, remember?

1025
01:44:30,430 --> 01:44:31,931
Those were a couple of jets.

1026
01:44:32,098 --> 01:44:34,225
Unbeatable jets.

1027
01:44:36,519 --> 01:44:39,104
The ring chose me for a reason.

1028
01:44:40,357 --> 01:44:42,149
This is why.

1029
01:44:43,735 --> 01:44:46,612
- Look, I'm probably not...
- Please don't. No.

1030
01:44:46,780 --> 01:44:48,155
Hey.

1031
01:44:57,207 --> 01:44:59,458
This is a mandatory evacuation.

1032
01:44:59,626 --> 01:45:01,961
Everyone must clear the streets
immediately.

1033
01:45:03,546 --> 01:45:07,633
Police emergency,
everyone must clear the street now.

1034
01:45:42,919 --> 01:45:45,337
Everybody off now! Now!

1035
01:45:45,880 --> 01:45:47,131
Go! Go!

1036
01:45:56,474 --> 01:45:57,808
Run!

1037
01:46:24,377 --> 01:46:25,961
- Run!
- Aah! Aah!

1038
01:46:44,689 --> 01:46:47,399
I feel your fear growing.

1039
01:46:47,817 --> 01:46:49,610
You will be dead soon.

1040
01:46:49,778 --> 01:46:52,571
In brightest day, in blackest night...

1041
01:46:52,739 --> 01:46:56,241
And when you're gone,
I'll destroy everything you ever loved.

1042
01:46:56,409 --> 01:46:59,411
...No evil shall escape my sight.

1043
01:46:59,579 --> 01:47:03,040
Your family, your home,
your planet will be no more.

1044
01:47:03,458 --> 01:47:07,336
Let those who worship evil's might...

1045
01:47:07,504 --> 01:47:12,132
The entire human race will be wiped out
because you, Hal Jordan...

1046
01:47:12,300 --> 01:47:13,842
...were afraid.

1047
01:47:14,010 --> 01:47:16,553
...Beware my power:

1048
01:47:17,097 --> 01:47:18,430
Green Lantern's light!

1049
01:48:34,424 --> 01:48:38,343
The bigger you are, the faster you burn.

1050
01:50:39,966 --> 01:50:42,426
Though his time
wearing the ring has been brief...

1051
01:50:43,511 --> 01:50:48,807
...Hal Jordan's defeat of Parallax will be
remembered as long as the Corps exists.

1052
01:50:49,017 --> 01:50:52,644
His actions are a reminder
of why the ring chose each of us.

1053
01:50:53,813 --> 01:50:55,647
To overcome fear...

1054
01:50:56,316 --> 01:50:59,651
...and destroy evil wherever it may hide.

1055
01:51:08,202 --> 01:51:10,454
As Lanterns,
we must fight with all our will.

1056
01:51:12,206 --> 01:51:14,666
Our wills haven't always been united.

1057
01:51:16,502 --> 01:51:17,753
It's time they were.

1058
01:51:19,797 --> 01:51:22,424
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Can I train them or can I train them?

1059
01:51:23,676 --> 01:51:26,053
You're impertinent, Hal Jordan.

1060
01:51:26,220 --> 01:51:29,848
You're rash, volatile, opinionated.

1061
01:51:31,351 --> 01:51:34,603
It seems Abin Sur found another
just like himself.

1062
01:52:16,562 --> 01:52:19,481
Wow, I am never getting used to that.

1063
01:52:24,070 --> 01:52:27,572
My new job requires that I travel.

1064
01:52:30,410 --> 01:52:31,827
Be away for a while.

1065
01:52:35,665 --> 01:52:39,418
Away, never gone.

1066
01:52:44,173 --> 01:52:45,382
Hal.

1067
01:52:45,550 --> 01:52:46,883
Yeah?

1068
01:52:47,260 --> 01:52:49,428
Can you take off the mask?

1069
01:52:54,600 --> 01:52:55,934
That's really cool. Ha, ha.

1070
01:53:10,616 --> 01:53:12,451
So, what happens now?

1071
01:53:13,703 --> 01:53:15,620
I'm gonna go look for trouble.

1072
01:53:39,145 --> 01:53:41,563
Of all the Lanterns
who have ever worn the ring...

1073
01:53:41,731 --> 01:53:44,733
...there was one
whose light shined brightest.

1074
01:53:45,151 --> 01:53:48,487
At first, his humanity
was thought to be a weakness.

1075
01:53:48,654 --> 01:53:52,574
And yet it proved to be
his greatest strength.
