2
00:03:58,312 --> 00:03:59,897
Your breakfast, sir.

3
00:04:17,915 --> 00:04:23,838
Pork bellies! I have a hunch
something exciting is going to happen

4
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:26,465
in the pork belly market this morning.

5
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:43,274
Will Miss Penelope
be dining with you this evening, sir?

6
00:04:43,941 --> 00:04:46,277
Yes. Yes, she will.

7
00:05:28,444 --> 00:05:30,946
- Good morning, Mr Winthorpe.
- Morning, Folsey.

8
00:05:40,831 --> 00:05:42,911
- Morning, Mr Winthorpe.
- Good morning.

9
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:45,419
- Morning, Mr Winthorpe.
- Morning.

10
00:05:46,962 --> 00:05:49,215
- Morning, Mr Winthorpe.
- Morning.

11
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:52,093
Good morning, Mr Winthorpe.

12
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:56,430
- Morning, Mr Winthorpe.
- Morning, Mr Winthorpe.

13
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:00,893
- Good morning, Mr Winthorpe.
- Morning.

14
00:06:03,646 --> 00:06:06,148
- Good morning, Mr Winthorpe.
- Morning.

15
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:27,586
Pork bellies. I knew it. I knew it!

16
00:06:44,854 --> 00:06:47,982
- Good morning, Mr Duke.
- Good morning, Mr Duke.

17
00:06:49,608 --> 00:06:52,319
- Good morning, Mr Duke.
- Morning, Mr Duke.

18
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:55,406
- Morning, Mr Duke.
- Morning, Mr Duke.

19
00:06:55,531 --> 00:06:58,617
- Mr Duke.
- Good morning, Mr Duke.

20
00:06:58,743 --> 00:07:00,828
Good morning, Mr Duke.

21
00:07:32,276 --> 00:07:34,487
When do we sell?

22
00:07:34,612 --> 00:07:38,157
How stupid these scientists are!

23
00:07:38,282 --> 00:07:42,453
The eternal question! There is no question.
The answer's obvious.

24
00:07:42,578 --> 00:07:45,998
I don't care about
heredity versus environment.

25
00:07:46,123 --> 00:07:50,294
I'm sick and tired of hearing it. I care
how much we get for our pork bellies.

26
00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:52,505
Winthorpe will sell
at 76 and a quarter.

27
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:55,257
His charts say that's as high as it'll go.

28
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,761
It'll never get that high. Let's sell now.

29
00:07:58,886 --> 00:08:02,098
Patience, Mortimer.
Let's see if Winthorpe's right.

30
00:08:03,766 --> 00:08:07,061
Winthorpe's wrong. It's topped out.
I say we sell now.

31
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:09,939
- Just another few seconds.
- The market's closing.

32
00:08:10,064 --> 00:08:12,691
We won't get the order in.

33
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:35,715
We just made an extra $347,000.

34
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,217
Get me Winthorpe.

35
00:08:38,342 --> 00:08:42,054
Well, I never had an instant
of doubt in my mind, Mortimer.

36
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:46,267
Yes, I'm sure a lot of people
went belly-up on that one.

37
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:48,477
I'll see you at the club.

38
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:20,342
Morning Mr Duke.

39
00:09:20,468 --> 00:09:23,846
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
Thank you very much.

40
00:09:23,971 --> 00:09:27,141
Vietnam did this to me
but I'm not bitter, thank you.

41
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:30,436
Merry Christmas! Happy Hanukkah?

42
00:09:30,561 --> 00:09:33,355
Spare a poor war veteran some change?
I'm on my knees for life.

43
00:09:33,481 --> 00:09:35,524
I have no money to give you.

44
00:09:35,649 --> 00:09:37,485
Please, anything.

45
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,279
A quarter, just a couple of dollars.

46
00:09:40,404 --> 00:09:43,199
Anything, a quarter, a nickel, please.

47
00:09:43,324 --> 00:09:45,618
Hey, man, I really don't appreciate this.

48
00:09:45,743 --> 00:09:49,747
I don't care what it is,
smoked ham, anything, a jacket.

49
00:09:49,872 --> 00:09:53,000
Thanks! How'd you
like a stump up your ass?

50
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:56,670
- Stay outta here!
- You've got a lot of soul. I appreciate it.

51
00:10:02,093 --> 00:10:04,178
Listen to this.

52
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:06,389
"Expect this stagnation to continue,

53
00:10:06,514 --> 00:10:08,599
"until the Department Of Agriculture's

54
00:10:08,724 --> 00:10:10,935
January crop report."

55
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:14,397
Exactly as we thought, Randolph.

56
00:10:14,522 --> 00:10:17,983
Wrong! Quite wrong. Untrue.

57
00:10:18,109 --> 00:10:20,194
They've given this genetics fellow

58
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:23,864
the Nobel Prize. He doesn't know
the first thing about human nature.

59
00:10:23,989 --> 00:10:28,369
We're about to make
millions of dollars in frozen orange juice

60
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:30,579
and you're talking about human nature.

61
00:10:30,705 --> 00:10:32,540
Money isn't everything.

62
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:33,833
Grow up.

63
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:36,460
Mother always said you were greedy.

64
00:10:36,585 --> 00:10:38,462
She meant it as a compliment.

65
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:47,430
Ezra, right on time.

66
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:52,309
I bet you thought
I'd forgotten your Christmas bonus.

67
00:10:52,435 --> 00:10:54,520
There you are.

68
00:10:55,479 --> 00:10:59,400
Five dollars!
Maybe I'll go to the movies...

69
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:02,695
by myself.

70
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:07,158
- Half of it is from me.
- Thank you, Mr Mortimer.

71
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:21,839
- Gentlemen.
- Looking good, Louis.

72
00:11:21,964 --> 00:11:23,674
Feeling good, Todd.

73
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:27,470
We need a fourth for squash today, Louis.
Are you interested?

74
00:11:27,595 --> 00:11:30,931
No can do. I'll be having dinner
with Penelope, tonight.

75
00:11:31,849 --> 00:11:36,937
- Oh, lucky you.
- It's not luck, Todd.

76
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:49,492
Randolph, Mortimer.

77
00:11:49,617 --> 00:11:51,952
What have you got for us?

78
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:54,246
It's that time of the month again.

79
00:11:54,372 --> 00:11:58,376
Payroll cheques for our employees,
which require your signatures.

80
00:11:58,501 --> 00:12:00,961
And no forgetting to sign the big ones.

81
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:04,673
We are paying some of our employees
an awful lot of money.

82
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:07,301
You can't get around
the minimum wage.

83
00:12:13,974 --> 00:12:19,772
$50,000 to Clarence Beeks!
Who the hell...

84
00:12:21,565 --> 00:12:25,319
I meant to ask you about that.
I went through our records,

85
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:28,781
and there doesn't seem to be
a Clarence Beeks employed with the firm.

86
00:12:30,658 --> 00:12:34,495
Oh, Clarence Beeks.
Yes, of course.

87
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:39,166
- He's doing something top secret for us.
- Research.

88
00:12:40,668 --> 00:12:42,753
How is Penelope?

89
00:12:42,878 --> 00:12:46,924
Don't forget she's our grandniece - you'd
better make an honest woman of her.

90
00:12:47,049 --> 00:12:51,220
Well, I'll certainly try, sir.
The wedding invitations go out this week.

91
00:12:51,345 --> 00:12:53,347
Good. Good work, Winthorpe.

92
00:12:54,724 --> 00:12:57,476
Don't worry about this,
Winthorpe.

93
00:12:57,601 --> 00:13:00,563
I'll take care of this one personally.

94
00:13:02,773 --> 00:13:05,985
- Goodbye, Winthorpe.
- Goodbye, Winthorpe.

95
00:13:17,538 --> 00:13:19,957
Winthorpe is a very steady young man.

96
00:13:20,082 --> 00:13:22,918
We're lucky
to have him managing our firm.

97
00:13:23,044 --> 00:13:28,090
Oh, hogwash. Exeter, Harvard -
he's the product of good environment.

98
00:13:28,215 --> 00:13:30,926
It's got nothing to do with environment.

99
00:13:31,052 --> 00:13:34,597
With his genes, you could put him
anywhere and he'd come out on top.

100
00:13:34,722 --> 00:13:38,392
Breeding, same as in race horses.
It's in the blood.

101
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:50,529
Hey, baby, what's happening?
How you doing?

102
00:13:50,654 --> 00:13:54,867
Once you've had a man with no legs,
you never go back.

103
00:13:54,992 --> 00:13:58,120
I know what you're thinking.
You seen "Porgy And Bess"?

104
00:13:58,245 --> 00:14:00,664
We can make it, baby. Me and you.

105
00:14:02,124 --> 00:14:03,334
You bitch!

106
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,225
- Who's that? Who's there?
- Police!

107
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:23,813
We've had complaints about con men
pretending to be blind and crippled.

108
00:14:23,938 --> 00:14:27,691
I ain't seen nothing since
I stepped on that landmine in Vietnam.

109
00:14:27,817 --> 00:14:29,902
It was very painful.

110
00:14:30,027 --> 00:14:32,530
You were in 'Nam? So were we. Where?

111
00:14:32,655 --> 00:14:35,616
I was in... Sang Bang...

112
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:37,201
Dang Gong...

113
00:14:37,326 --> 00:14:39,912
I was all over the place, a lot of places.

114
00:14:40,037 --> 00:14:41,539
What unit?

115
00:14:41,664 --> 00:14:44,917
I was with the Green Berets,
Special Unit Battalions...

116
00:14:45,042 --> 00:14:49,714
Commando Airborne Tactics...
Specialist Tactics Unit Battalion.

117
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,257
Yeah, it was real hush hush.

118
00:14:51,382 --> 00:14:54,885
I was Agent Orange,
Special Agent Orange, that was me.

119
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:57,096
Airborne, huh?

120
00:15:07,565 --> 00:15:09,692
I can see! I can see!

121
00:15:09,817 --> 00:15:11,736
I have... I have legs.

122
00:15:11,861 --> 00:15:15,156
I have... Oh shit, look at this.
Legs! I can walk.

123
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:18,117
Jesus, praise Jesus.

124
00:15:18,242 --> 00:15:22,830
I appreciate this. Oh, this is beautiful.
I can't believe... Thank you.

125
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:24,915
I don't know what to do it's...

126
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:29,378
Glory be to God. Praise Jesus.
Look at me.

127
00:15:29,503 --> 00:15:32,006
This is too much. I can't believe it.

128
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:37,386
Ah, beautiful. Listen... I can't thank you.
First Moses, now this. God, Jesus...

129
00:15:37,511 --> 00:15:40,973
I'm so happy, oh God.
Look at me, this is too much.

130
00:15:41,098 --> 00:15:44,060
What a happy day!

131
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:47,188
Really, I appreciate it.
Y'alls OK now. Look at this.

132
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:51,233
I can walk. I don't know what to say...
I'll be all right. Take it easy.

133
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:55,154
Y'all beautiful,
both of you are, the two of you.

134
00:16:02,912 --> 00:16:05,206
How are you doing?

135
00:16:12,546 --> 00:16:14,882
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Stop thief.

136
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:17,718
- Help, help!
- What are you talking about, man?

137
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:21,263
Don't kill me, take it, please.
I'm getting married.

138
00:16:21,389 --> 00:16:24,058
- I don't want your bag.
- Help! Help!

139
00:16:25,935 --> 00:16:27,311
Help! Help!

140
00:16:28,396 --> 00:16:29,563
Help!

141
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:32,358
He's in there. After him.

142
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:39,865
- Excuse me.
- Watch out. He probably has a weapon.

143
00:16:42,993 --> 00:16:45,996
Stop him. He has my briefcase.

144
00:16:46,122 --> 00:16:48,332
He's inside. That guy's crazy.

145
00:16:52,628 --> 00:16:54,714
He's getting away.

146
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:57,049
There he is. That's him. Get him.

147
00:16:57,174 --> 00:17:00,177
He's under the table.
Somebody go under there.

148
00:17:00,302 --> 00:17:02,388
Right there. There he is.

149
00:17:06,016 --> 00:17:08,936
Is there a problem, officers?

150
00:17:16,694 --> 00:17:19,363
What in heaven's name is going on here?

151
00:17:19,488 --> 00:17:24,285
- He tried to rob the payroll, Randolph.
- I didn't, he bumped into me.

152
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:27,246
I did not.
You tried to grab my briefcase.

153
00:17:27,371 --> 00:17:30,291
- It was an accident.
- An accident, really?

154
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:33,085
- What will happen to him?
- We'll book him

155
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:36,547
on assault, robbery, and resisting arrest.

156
00:17:36,672 --> 00:17:39,050
Well done, Winthorpe.

157
00:17:39,175 --> 00:17:42,928
I'm innocent.
I was trying to give his briefcase back.

158
00:17:43,054 --> 00:17:45,598
I can't go to jail cos of some ass-wipe.

159
00:17:45,723 --> 00:17:48,350
Officer, I would like to press full charges.

160
00:17:48,476 --> 00:17:51,020
People like this are a menace
to decent society.

161
00:17:51,187 --> 00:17:53,814
You're from a broken home of course?

162
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:55,900
Yeah, it was broke. So what?

163
00:17:56,025 --> 00:17:58,986
You have a history of juvenile arrests,
I presume?

164
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:02,406
Drug abuse, reform school,
state prisons and all that-

165
00:18:02,531 --> 00:18:05,618
I want a lawyer.
Is there a lawyer in the house?

166
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:16,170
That man is a product
of a poor environment.

167
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:18,798
There's nothing wrong with him,
I can prove it.

168
00:18:19,048 --> 00:18:22,301
Of course there's
something wrong with him...

169
00:18:22,426 --> 00:18:24,595
He's a Negro!

170
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,099
He's probably been stealing
since he could crawl.

171
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:44,740
Given the right
surroundings and encouragement,

172
00:18:45,574 --> 00:18:50,621
I'll bet that that man could run
our company as well as Winthorpe.

173
00:18:50,746 --> 00:18:53,791
Are we talking about a wager, Randolph?

174
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:59,839
I suppose you think Winthorpe...
say if he were to lose his job,

175
00:18:59,964 --> 00:19:02,758
would resort
to holding up people on the streets.

176
00:19:02,883 --> 00:19:06,721
No, I don't think that
would be enough for Winthorpe.

177
00:19:06,846 --> 00:19:12,351
We'd have to heap a little more
misfortune on those narrow shoulders.

178
00:19:13,102 --> 00:19:15,604
If he lost his job and his home

179
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:18,357
and his fiancee and his friends.

180
00:19:18,482 --> 00:19:22,403
If he were somehow disgraced
and arrested by the police

181
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:24,613
and thrown in jail, even.

182
00:19:25,948 --> 00:19:29,952
Yes, I'm sure he'd take to crime
like a fish to water.

183
00:19:30,077 --> 00:19:34,915
You'd have to put him in the wrong
surroundings, with the worst sort of people.

184
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:38,586
I mean real scum, Randolph.

185
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:40,796
We've done it before.

186
00:19:41,047 --> 00:19:43,549
This time it's in a good cause.

187
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:46,469
How much do you want to bet?

188
00:19:46,594 --> 00:19:49,305
- The usual amount.
- Why not?

189
00:19:54,477 --> 00:19:57,605
You're so brave, Louis.

190
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,982
Someone has to take a stand
against criminals.

191
00:20:00,107 --> 00:20:02,401
But he could have killed you.

192
00:20:02,526 --> 00:20:07,198
In such a situation, you have
no time to think - instinct takes over.

193
00:20:07,323 --> 00:20:10,284
It's either kill or be killed.

194
00:20:13,954 --> 00:20:16,165
Did Louis tell you what he did today?

195
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:23,255
Mr Louis kindly shared this afternoon's
excitement with me, Miss Penelope.

196
00:20:25,674 --> 00:20:28,177
You're so hot tempered, darling.

197
00:20:31,305 --> 00:20:33,849
I would have grovelled
and begged for mercy.

198
00:20:41,524 --> 00:20:43,943
I want you Louis, now.

199
00:20:48,155 --> 00:20:50,366
- Coleman.
- Sir?

200
00:20:51,575 --> 00:20:54,745
We'll take our drinks in the living room,
by the fire.

201
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,792
- No dessert, sir?
- You have it.

202
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:03,838
Thank you, sir.

203
00:21:12,263 --> 00:21:14,807
Hello.

204
00:21:14,974 --> 00:21:18,310
Oh, hello Mr Duke, sir...
A what?

205
00:21:20,771 --> 00:21:23,315
A scientific experiment.

206
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:25,651
Not at all, sir, no I...

207
00:21:25,776 --> 00:21:28,362
It all sounds very...

208
00:21:29,196 --> 00:21:31,282
...original.

209
00:21:31,824 --> 00:21:35,369
Well, it's your house and I work for you.

210
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:38,372
I shall make the necessary arrangements.

211
00:21:39,582 --> 00:21:41,876
And a very good night to you, sir.

212
00:21:45,921 --> 00:21:48,007
What a scumbag.

213
00:21:48,924 --> 00:21:52,803
Mumsie wants to have a party for us
right after New Year's.

214
00:21:52,928 --> 00:21:55,431
January 2nd, is that good for you?

215
00:21:55,556 --> 00:21:58,684
OK with me, hon. Darn nice of her too.

216
00:21:58,809 --> 00:22:01,562
Oh, heck. 2nd January. Can't do it.

217
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:05,191
- Oh, Louis.
- It's the day the crop reports come out.

218
00:22:05,941 --> 00:22:11,197
What do those stupid old crop reports
have to do with Mumsie's party?

219
00:22:11,322 --> 00:22:14,408
It's the busiest time
of year in the office, sugarpuff.

220
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:18,704
It's just not fair. Why can't you
make them do it another day?

221
00:22:18,829 --> 00:22:22,875
The Department Of Agriculture gets those
estimates from all over the country.

222
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,086
Pork bellies, soybeans,

223
00:22:25,211 --> 00:22:27,171
frozen orange juice.

224
00:22:27,296 --> 00:22:30,132
I'll just have to ask Todd to take me.

225
00:22:31,342 --> 00:22:35,221
Now, wait just a minute. If you think
I'm going to let that playboy...

226
00:22:35,346 --> 00:22:37,598
Just teasing you.

227
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:39,934
You know something, Witherspoon?

228
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:44,063
- What?
- We are going to make a great couple.

229
00:22:44,188 --> 00:22:46,816
We're going to have a great life.

230
00:22:48,609 --> 00:22:51,362
- Excuse me, sir.
- What is it?

231
00:22:51,487 --> 00:22:54,907
Will you be needing me any more,
this evening, sir?

232
00:22:55,991 --> 00:22:59,912
No, I think I have everything I want.

233
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:02,456
Good night, sir.

234
00:23:12,174 --> 00:23:14,677
I had to keep him
under surveillance.

235
00:23:14,802 --> 00:23:18,597
I had to make sure
he had his payroll before I made my move.

236
00:23:18,723 --> 00:23:21,934
- Tell us how you cut him.
- With no knife.

237
00:23:22,059 --> 00:23:26,397
- You told me you cut the dude.
- With these I cut him.

238
00:23:26,522 --> 00:23:30,067
I am a chain belt in Kung Fu.
Bruce Lee was my teacher.

239
00:23:54,592 --> 00:23:59,263
That's the "quart of blood" technique.
Do it, a quart of blood drops out of a body.

240
00:23:59,388 --> 00:24:03,601
- Tell him how you beat on the cop.
- Cops, plural.

241
00:24:03,726 --> 00:24:08,230
Beat the shit out of ten cops and had
to change my whole strategy around.

242
00:24:08,355 --> 00:24:12,943
When they brought you in and booked you,
you was crying like a pussy.

243
00:24:13,069 --> 00:24:18,074
- Yeah.
- The cops threw tear gas in my face.

244
00:24:18,199 --> 00:24:21,994
I still walked in like a man,
so get outta my face.

245
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:25,414
You beating up a man,
putting him in hospital.

246
00:24:25,539 --> 00:24:28,042
- How come I don't see marks on you?
- Yeah.

247
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:30,586
Cos I'm a karate man, all right.

248
00:24:30,711 --> 00:24:34,423
Karate men bruise on the inside
They don't show their weaknesses.

249
00:24:34,548 --> 00:24:38,636
You don't know that, motherfucker.
Now get off my back, all right.

250
00:24:39,637 --> 00:24:43,224
I wish my bitches would hurry up.
I ain't got time to be here.

251
00:24:43,349 --> 00:24:46,477
Where is your bitches,
Mr Big Time Pimp?

252
00:24:46,602 --> 00:24:47,937
Yeah.

253
00:24:51,065 --> 00:24:54,485
Didn't I tell you,
the phone in my limousine is busted

254
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:56,696
and I can't get in contact
with my bitches.

255
00:24:57,446 --> 00:25:00,491
Yeah, the phone in the limo had busted.
Are you ignorant?

256
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:06,205
- Look, sit down, all right.
- It ain't cool being no jive turkey

257
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:08,541
so close to Thanksgiving.

258
00:25:12,253 --> 00:25:13,713
Hey, now...

259
00:25:15,297 --> 00:25:18,426
You boys don't know what you're doing,
I can see that already.

260
00:25:18,551 --> 00:25:23,264
Do you know who you're fucking with?
Back the fuck up, back up.

261
00:25:23,389 --> 00:25:27,309
D'you know who you're fucking with
in cell number four on the ninth floor.

262
00:25:27,435 --> 00:25:29,979
- Billy Ray Valentine?
- Yes.

263
00:25:30,146 --> 00:25:31,605
Move it.

264
00:25:31,731 --> 00:25:35,651
- You made bail.
- I did?

265
00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:50,332
May I suggest using a night stick, officer?

266
00:25:50,458 --> 00:25:52,334
Get outta here.

267
00:26:19,236 --> 00:26:20,696
Mr Valentine.

268
00:26:22,573 --> 00:26:24,867
Could you spare us a moment?

269
00:26:26,243 --> 00:26:30,581
- Don't I know you two guys?
- Step inside, nice and warm in here.

270
00:26:30,706 --> 00:26:36,087
- Whisky, all you want.
- I ain't falling for the same trick twice.

271
00:26:36,212 --> 00:26:39,423
You'd get me in the car,
and have me arrested for stealing it.

272
00:26:39,548 --> 00:26:42,635
Why should we do that, Mr Valentine?

273
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,513
We're the ones who bailed you out.

274
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:22,925
Who are y'all? What y'all want?

275
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:27,888
We want to help you. My brother and I
run a privately funded programme,

276
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:30,808
to rehabilitate
culturally disadvantaged people.

277
00:27:30,933 --> 00:27:35,187
We'd like to supply you
with a home of your own, a car,

278
00:27:35,312 --> 00:27:39,108
a generous bank account,
and employment with our company.

279
00:27:39,233 --> 00:27:42,528
We're going to start you at $80,000 a year.

280
00:27:44,196 --> 00:27:46,282
- $80,000?
- Mmm.

281
00:27:46,407 --> 00:27:47,908
Excuse me.

282
00:27:50,286 --> 00:27:52,913
This is a practical joke, right, brother?

283
00:27:55,332 --> 00:27:59,211
Then these dudes
are a couple of faggots, huh?

284
00:27:59,336 --> 00:28:01,422
What's my next move, man?

285
00:28:03,132 --> 00:28:05,217
Thank you, you've been helpful.

286
00:28:09,263 --> 00:28:13,267
- What about the payroll?
- We've had the charges dropped.

287
00:28:13,392 --> 00:28:15,603
You're a free man, Valentine.

288
00:28:15,728 --> 00:28:18,856
We can stop right now
and you can walk out on us forever.

289
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:33,954
No, I believe I can hang out
with you fellas for a while.

290
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,415
- Excellent.
- I'm Randolph Duke.

291
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,626
How you doing Randy, what's happening?

292
00:28:38,751 --> 00:28:42,046
- My younger brother, Mortimer.
- Hey Morty! What it is.

293
00:28:42,171 --> 00:28:44,423
Billy Ray Valentine, Capricorn.

294
00:28:44,548 --> 00:28:47,885
Randy, that's like Randy Jackson
from the Jackson Five, right?

295
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:50,346
- Yes, I suppose so.
- Yeah.

296
00:29:04,235 --> 00:29:06,654
Here we are, William.

297
00:29:08,906 --> 00:29:10,991
How you doing?

298
00:29:11,117 --> 00:29:13,869
Hey, Randy, Morty. This is nice, I like this.

299
00:29:13,994 --> 00:29:16,706
- William...
- Billy Ray.

300
00:29:16,831 --> 00:29:20,292
William, this is Coleman.
He'll look after your day-to-day needs.

301
00:29:20,418 --> 00:29:24,588
- Can I relieve you of those?
- You get a glass, I'll give you a sip.

302
00:29:25,631 --> 00:29:29,552
- Perhaps, your coat, sir?
- Yes, this is my coat.

303
00:29:29,677 --> 00:29:32,805
Coleman is here to take care of you.
He is your servant.

304
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:34,932
- May I?
- Get out of here.

305
00:29:35,057 --> 00:29:39,395
Valentine very badly wants to take a hot
bath and get into something comfortable.

306
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,814
Don't you, Valentine?

307
00:29:45,693 --> 00:29:47,778
Jacuzzi, sir?

308
00:29:47,903 --> 00:29:50,656
I knew you was faggots.
You ain't Jacuzzying nobody.

309
00:29:50,781 --> 00:29:53,284
It's a whirlpool bath sir.

310
00:29:53,409 --> 00:29:55,494
I think you'll enjoy it.

311
00:29:59,707 --> 00:30:03,836
Bubbles, man!
Say, when I was growing up,

312
00:30:03,961 --> 00:30:08,340
we want a Jacuzzi,
we had to fart in the tub. This is bad!

313
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:21,228
- What's he doing in there?
- He's singing, sir.

314
00:30:21,353 --> 00:30:23,439
They're very musical people, aren't they?

315
00:30:24,732 --> 00:30:29,111
- What shall I do with his clothes?
- Send them to the laundry.

316
00:30:29,236 --> 00:30:33,824
He'll need them to wear back to the ghetto,
after I've won our bet.

317
00:30:33,949 --> 00:30:38,621
- Well, what do you think?
- I like it, Randy, very nice.

318
00:30:38,746 --> 00:30:41,957
I like the way you have the mirror and stuff.

319
00:30:42,083 --> 00:30:46,045
- I don't think he understands.
- Morty, I do understand.

320
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:49,423
- William, this is your home.
- Right.

321
00:30:49,548 --> 00:30:53,344
- It belongs to you.
- Yeah, I like my home. It's very nice.

322
00:30:53,469 --> 00:30:57,098
- I have nice taste in houses.
- Everything here is yours.

323
00:30:57,223 --> 00:30:59,517
- This is my stuff?
- Your own property.

324
00:30:59,642 --> 00:31:01,727
- My own personal shit.
- You understand?

325
00:31:01,852 --> 00:31:04,980
Yeah, I like that.
You know what I like most?

326
00:31:05,106 --> 00:31:07,942
The curtains, it's beautiful the way
I've set this place up.

327
00:31:08,067 --> 00:31:10,945
This is something else.
I like it. The cabinets.

328
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:14,532
Beautiful. I suppose
you'll give me this TV set for free?

329
00:31:14,657 --> 00:31:16,992
- That's right.
- Everything here is mine?

330
00:31:17,118 --> 00:31:19,912
- I guess the stereo's mine too?
- Absolutely.

331
00:31:20,037 --> 00:31:22,748
This is too much.
I could really dig this. You know why?

332
00:31:22,873 --> 00:31:24,959
This happens to me every week.

333
00:31:25,084 --> 00:31:27,962
This is your house.

334
00:31:28,087 --> 00:31:31,882
These are your personal possessions.

335
00:31:32,007 --> 00:31:34,719
You will only be stealing from yourself.

336
00:31:34,844 --> 00:31:37,763
Look, first you throw my ass in jail.

337
00:31:37,888 --> 00:31:42,518
Then you run me some garbage
about how this is my house, this is my rug

338
00:31:42,643 --> 00:31:44,979
and this is my personal slave too.

339
00:31:45,104 --> 00:31:49,400
I understand how you feel
but the fact remains, all this is yours.

340
00:31:49,525 --> 00:31:51,944
You may do with it whatever you wish.

341
00:31:52,069 --> 00:31:55,948
This is my stuff.
I can do what I want with it, right?

342
00:31:56,073 --> 00:31:58,993
This is my vase, Billy Ray's vase?

343
00:31:59,118 --> 00:32:03,289
I can play Harlem Globetrotters
shit with it, like Meadow Lark Lemon?

344
00:32:06,751 --> 00:32:11,005
- Hey man, I'm sorry about that.
- Perfectly all right, it was your vase.

345
00:32:12,965 --> 00:32:15,217
That was a fake, right?

346
00:32:15,342 --> 00:32:17,970
I think we paid $35,000 for it.

347
00:32:19,805 --> 00:32:24,435
But, I seem to remember we estimated
its value at $50,000 for the insurance.

348
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:30,691
You see, Mortimer? William
has already made us a profit of $15,000.

349
00:32:39,742 --> 00:32:41,744
You want me to break something else?

350
00:32:41,869 --> 00:32:43,204
No.

351
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,640
Excuse me.

352
00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:12,191
I hope we're not pushing it, using Mr
Beeks for this, as well as the crop report.

353
00:33:12,316 --> 00:33:16,487
We are involved in a very important
scientific experiment, Mortimer

354
00:33:16,612 --> 00:33:19,323
and Mr Beeks has always proven reliable.

355
00:33:58,154 --> 00:34:00,072
Excuse me... Sorry.

356
00:34:06,454 --> 00:34:08,789
Hello, Todd. Gents.

357
00:34:22,928 --> 00:34:27,725
Gentlemen. There is something rotten
in the Heritage Club.

358
00:34:29,018 --> 00:34:31,771
Something that has
never raised its vile head

359
00:34:31,896 --> 00:34:35,524
in the 208 years of the club's history.

360
00:34:37,026 --> 00:34:38,903
There is a thief,

361
00:34:39,028 --> 00:34:41,113
and he's sitting here among us.

362
00:34:41,238 --> 00:34:44,283
Not an ordinary thief like the man

363
00:34:44,408 --> 00:34:47,787
Winthorpe had the guts
to stand up to yesterday.

364
00:34:47,912 --> 00:34:52,708
No, this man is a hundred times lower.

365
00:34:55,127 --> 00:34:58,798
I'd like to introduce Mr Beeks
of Lyndhurst Security.

366
00:35:03,302 --> 00:35:08,140
Thank you. I'd like
to ask you gentlemen to all stand up.

367
00:35:15,731 --> 00:35:19,360
I'd like to ask you to place
your left hand on the shoulder

368
00:35:19,485 --> 00:35:22,405
of the man to your left.

369
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:29,245
I would now ask you

370
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:34,291
to place your right hand in the coat pocket
of the member to your right.

371
00:35:34,417 --> 00:35:37,878
And empty the contents
of those pockets onto the table.

372
00:35:42,174 --> 00:35:44,093
Thank you.

373
00:35:44,552 --> 00:35:46,429
You may sit.

374
00:35:57,231 --> 00:36:00,359
We marked three $50 bills with red X's.

375
00:36:02,486 --> 00:36:05,031
Less than ten minutes ago

376
00:36:05,156 --> 00:36:09,201
those bills were stolen
from a coat in the cloakroom.

377
00:36:10,453 --> 00:36:13,414
One of our operatives witnessed the theft.

378
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:47,907
Now, wait a minute. I've never seen
this money before in my life.

379
00:36:48,032 --> 00:36:52,328
Randolph, Mortimer, this is outrageous.
I haven't done anything wrong.

380
00:36:53,162 --> 00:36:55,706
Oh, Winthorpe.

381
00:36:55,831 --> 00:36:58,876
I'm glad your parents
are not alive to see this.

382
00:37:00,127 --> 00:37:03,130
Wait, this is preposterous.
This is insane.

383
00:37:03,255 --> 00:37:06,133
I have no reason to steal. I'm not a thief.

384
00:37:06,258 --> 00:37:09,428
I demand a fair hearing.
At least grant me that.

385
00:37:29,198 --> 00:37:32,410
You realise you're making
a grave mistake.

386
00:37:32,535 --> 00:37:36,455
Boy, are you two going to be sorry.
You know who I am?

387
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:40,251
Yeah, Winthorpe Louis III.

388
00:37:40,376 --> 00:37:43,295
I'm permitted two calls,
point me to the phone.

389
00:37:43,421 --> 00:37:46,716
- Take off your clothes.
- Wait, I know my rights.

390
00:37:46,841 --> 00:37:48,259
Take off your clothes.

391
00:37:49,552 --> 00:37:53,389
You are making a career decision here.
Now, you'd better think about it.

392
00:37:53,514 --> 00:37:56,600
Because you'll have to live with it
for the rest of your life.

393
00:37:57,727 --> 00:38:00,813
Strip, before I tear you a new asshole.

394
00:38:03,774 --> 00:38:05,860
Did you hear what this man said?

395
00:38:05,985 --> 00:38:09,447
Now, I have witnesses.
This man is physically threatening me.

396
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,618
Winthorpe...

397
00:38:14,744 --> 00:38:17,538
Louis the third.

398
00:38:17,663 --> 00:38:21,333
All right. One gold watch.

399
00:38:25,254 --> 00:38:28,174
One alligator skin wallet.

400
00:38:29,633 --> 00:38:32,887
Master Charge,
American Express... Gold Card.

401
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:37,016
Visa, Diner's Club, Carte Blanche.

402
00:38:38,142 --> 00:38:40,227
Two tickets...

403
00:38:40,895 --> 00:38:44,482
- "La Bo-heem"
- "La Boheme" - it's an opera.

404
00:38:45,232 --> 00:38:47,318
It's an opera.

405
00:38:54,867 --> 00:38:59,288
- One cellophane bag.
- I've never seen that before in my life.

406
00:39:02,833 --> 00:39:06,379
That's PCP - phencyclidine.
Angel dust.

407
00:39:06,504 --> 00:39:09,006
You ever seen
what this stuff does to kids?

408
00:39:09,131 --> 00:39:13,469
You're looking
at three to five, mandatory... Louis.

409
00:39:31,612 --> 00:39:35,700
What's happening, Terry?
Gimme a bottle of your best champagne.

410
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:41,789
You've got a nerve,
showing your face here after all this time.

411
00:39:41,914 --> 00:39:44,250
Look, man, I got your money.

412
00:39:44,959 --> 00:39:48,879
I got your poor... measly... $27...

413
00:39:49,046 --> 00:39:51,173
with interest.

414
00:39:52,633 --> 00:39:55,594
Billy Ray, honey. Is that you?

415
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:59,682
Who do you think it is?
Terence, get the lady some champagne.

416
00:39:59,807 --> 00:40:04,145
In fact, champagne for everybody,
courtesy of Billy Ray Valentine.

417
00:40:12,236 --> 00:40:14,321
A toast to Billy Ray?

418
00:40:18,909 --> 00:40:20,369
I'm very sexy.

419
00:40:20,494 --> 00:40:24,582
People will say, "Billy Ray, you're sexy,"
and not understand my sexuality.

420
00:40:24,707 --> 00:40:26,250
I know.

421
00:40:28,586 --> 00:40:32,840
You was in the tank last night,
braggin' on your limousine.

422
00:40:33,674 --> 00:40:36,510
You're the motherfucker
I was gonna carve.

423
00:40:36,635 --> 00:40:38,512
Yeah.

424
00:40:41,807 --> 00:40:43,684
Motherfucker?

425
00:40:43,809 --> 00:40:45,603
<i>Moi?</i>

426
00:40:45,728 --> 00:40:49,607
That's my limousine outside,
why don't you take a look at it?

427
00:40:49,732 --> 00:40:51,817
Right outside?

428
00:40:52,526 --> 00:40:55,321
Yeah.

429
00:40:55,446 --> 00:40:57,531
You took care of him, baby.

430
00:40:57,656 --> 00:41:01,160
I was gonna kick his ass,
but I'm a peaceful man.

431
00:41:09,418 --> 00:41:12,338
Ladies, it's time for me to get home.

432
00:41:12,463 --> 00:41:16,926
But if any of you ladies want
to drop by my house for cocktails,

433
00:41:17,051 --> 00:41:19,678
there's plenty of room in my limousine.

434
00:41:19,804 --> 00:41:21,889
Come on, everybody.

435
00:41:44,954 --> 00:41:48,541
- You're looking so fine, Billy Ray.
- Thank you very much.

436
00:41:54,213 --> 00:41:58,134
If you're gonna vomit,
the bathroom's downstairs.

437
00:41:58,259 --> 00:42:00,344
No, downstairs, man.

438
00:42:02,096 --> 00:42:03,556
Shit!

439
00:42:06,183 --> 00:42:08,436
Hey! Hey!

440
00:42:08,561 --> 00:42:11,772
That's a Persian rug. It's from Persia.

441
00:42:19,447 --> 00:42:21,782
What is this shit here?

442
00:42:21,907 --> 00:42:25,619
Hold up! Hey, who's been
putting out their Kools on my floor?

443
00:42:26,787 --> 00:42:30,750
Who has been putting out
their Kools on my floor?

444
00:42:36,255 --> 00:42:38,883
Have you people ever heard of coasters?

445
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:47,475
Would you like me to prepare some
more hors d'oeuvres for the guests, sir?

446
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,685
Fuck them.

447
00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:54,106
Coleman, there was more people
in this room before, where 'd they go?

448
00:42:54,231 --> 00:42:57,902
I believe some of them
have adjourned upstairs, sir.

449
00:42:58,110 --> 00:42:59,987
To my bedroom?

450
00:43:01,906 --> 00:43:04,200
I'm waiting for you, Billy Ray.

451
00:43:05,117 --> 00:43:07,286
Put your clothes on
and get out.

452
00:43:25,262 --> 00:43:27,431
Yeah, that's my girl, over there.

453
00:43:34,855 --> 00:43:37,191
Can I have everybody's attention please?

454
00:43:51,956 --> 00:43:54,250
Get the fuck out!

455
00:43:58,921 --> 00:44:01,132
Good night, sir.

456
00:44:01,257 --> 00:44:04,760
Good night, madam.
I hope you enjoyed it.

457
00:44:08,848 --> 00:44:10,307
Thank you.

458
00:44:14,395 --> 00:44:17,440
It was a stone groove, my man.

459
00:44:17,565 --> 00:44:19,650
You are the most righteous...

460
00:44:19,775 --> 00:44:23,279
Get the fuck out, man.
Let's go, come on.

461
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:26,198
Hurry up.

462
00:44:27,241 --> 00:44:31,203
And be quiet out there.
My neighbours are asleep, they work too.

463
00:44:35,207 --> 00:44:37,126
Well, your...

464
00:44:37,251 --> 00:44:40,880
Your friends seemed to enjoy it,
I thought it was a great success.

465
00:44:41,005 --> 00:44:46,052
They weren't friends. They're a bunch of
freeloaders, treating my house like a zoo.

466
00:44:47,511 --> 00:44:52,433
Why don't you retire, sir? I'll straighten up.
You've got a big day tomorrow.

467
00:44:54,852 --> 00:44:58,022
Yeah, yeah, I think I will...

468
00:44:59,899 --> 00:45:01,776
...retire.

469
00:45:02,651 --> 00:45:05,321
Good night, Coleman. Thanks, man.

470
00:45:11,285 --> 00:45:12,828
Good night, sir.

471
00:45:33,349 --> 00:45:35,518
Let's go, Winthorpe.

472
00:45:48,406 --> 00:45:52,201
- Excuse me.
- I'll see you later, we'll have lunch.

473
00:45:52,326 --> 00:45:55,371
How would you like
to make a fast hundred?

474
00:45:55,496 --> 00:45:57,581
I just got out.

475
00:45:57,707 --> 00:46:02,294
Are you trying to entrap me right here?
You guys must be getting desperate.

476
00:46:30,656 --> 00:46:32,742
Is that your purse?

477
00:46:34,702 --> 00:46:36,787
Yes.

478
00:46:36,912 --> 00:46:38,998
That's a nice purse.

479
00:46:41,333 --> 00:46:43,419
Thank you.

480
00:46:49,216 --> 00:46:51,761
Darling, I'm so glad to see you.

481
00:46:52,553 --> 00:46:55,473
Louis, you're making a scene.

482
00:46:56,349 --> 00:46:58,434
The good news is I'm innocent.

483
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:01,729
I've never done anything resembling this.

484
00:47:01,854 --> 00:47:04,982
Louis, you look awful. I'm so ashamed.

485
00:47:05,107 --> 00:47:07,902
Those clothes and those shoes and...

486
00:47:09,070 --> 00:47:12,698
you've been fighting, and you smell.

487
00:47:13,741 --> 00:47:15,826
I smell?

488
00:47:15,951 --> 00:47:19,663
Penelope, do you realise
where I've been since yesterday?

489
00:47:19,789 --> 00:47:22,500
They beat me up and stole my clothes.

490
00:47:22,625 --> 00:47:24,919
Those men wanted to have sex with me.

491
00:47:25,044 --> 00:47:28,839
- Can we discuss this somewhere else?
- They tried to bend me over this...

492
00:47:28,964 --> 00:47:33,427
If this place is indicative
of correctional institutions in this country,

493
00:47:33,552 --> 00:47:36,097
they might as well let all the convicts out.

494
00:47:36,222 --> 00:47:38,307
It's far worse on the inside.

495
00:47:38,432 --> 00:47:43,270
Stealing from your friends, Louis?
Heroin, Louis? Have you lost your mind?

496
00:47:43,396 --> 00:47:46,732
Mother wants me to call off the wedding
and so does Todd.

497
00:47:46,857 --> 00:47:49,485
Todd, what does Todd have to do with it?

498
00:47:49,610 --> 00:47:54,407
You've been fired from Duke & Duke.
They're charging you with embezzlement.

499
00:47:55,574 --> 00:47:58,411
Embezzlement?
I've never stolen anything in my life.

500
00:47:58,536 --> 00:48:00,705
How could the man I loved,

501
00:48:00,830 --> 00:48:04,625
whose children I wanted to have
and breast-feed, be a heroin dealer?

502
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:07,086
It wasn't heroin, it was angel dust, PCP...

503
00:48:08,212 --> 00:48:11,507
Listen Penelope,
I swear to you, on my honour,

504
00:48:11,632 --> 00:48:13,718
with almighty God as my witness,

505
00:48:13,843 --> 00:48:16,387
I am not an angel dust dealer.

506
00:48:20,933 --> 00:48:23,102
Oh, Louis.

507
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:30,067
I've been looking
everywhere for you, baby.

508
00:48:30,192 --> 00:48:34,405
- Louis, I'm hurting. I just need a shot.
- Would you please...

509
00:48:34,530 --> 00:48:38,701
- Who is this person?
- I've never seen this woman before.

510
00:48:40,244 --> 00:48:42,329
Don't say that, Louis.

511
00:48:44,415 --> 00:48:48,044
Come on baby, just a dime bag.
I'll do all those things you like.

512
00:48:51,881 --> 00:48:56,510
You lying... filthy... disgusting... creep.

513
00:48:56,635 --> 00:49:01,557
Todd was right about you. I never want
to see you again as long as I live.

514
00:49:13,652 --> 00:49:17,198
Grand! Great! Thanks a lot.

515
00:49:17,698 --> 00:49:21,786
It was a joke.
Your friend said it would get you off.

516
00:49:21,911 --> 00:49:26,999
- Someone told you to do this to me?
- Yeah, and he paid me $100.

517
00:49:27,124 --> 00:49:28,584
He's over there.

518
00:49:32,463 --> 00:49:35,800
Let me get this straight,
I give you 20 for the cab,

519
00:49:35,925 --> 00:49:38,302
and you'll give me 50 at your house?

520
00:49:38,427 --> 00:49:41,806
That is correct.
My butler will give you $50,

521
00:49:41,931 --> 00:49:44,016
and drive you anywhere you wish.

522
00:49:44,141 --> 00:49:47,603
You don't exactly look like
the type that has a butler.

523
00:49:47,728 --> 00:49:52,316
- If you're hustling me...
- Hustling you, hustling you?

524
00:49:55,444 --> 00:49:58,989
You don't think they give these
to just anyone, do you?

525
00:49:59,115 --> 00:50:03,369
I can charge goods and services
in over 86 countries around the world.

526
00:50:04,537 --> 00:50:07,665
Yeah? Well I don't take credit cards.

527
00:50:17,466 --> 00:50:20,428
You'll see what a mistake all this was.

528
00:50:30,021 --> 00:50:31,272
Yes?

529
00:50:31,397 --> 00:50:35,109
Coleman, could you let me in?
I'm having trouble with my key.

530
00:50:35,234 --> 00:50:40,656
- Who are you? What do you want?
- Just let me in, I'm in no mood for jokes.

531
00:50:40,781 --> 00:50:45,494
Coleman? There's no Coleman here.
You've made a mistake.

532
00:50:53,002 --> 00:50:55,087
Excuse me, for a moment.

533
00:50:55,963 --> 00:50:59,383
Coleman! Let me in.

534
00:51:01,594 --> 00:51:04,555
If you don't go away,
I shall call the police.

535
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:23,157
Hello. I'll be making a cash withdrawal
for the amount of $500.

536
00:51:24,533 --> 00:51:26,702
In fact, make it $1,000.

537
00:51:33,876 --> 00:51:35,586
Excuse me.

538
00:51:44,178 --> 00:51:48,724
I'm sorry, Mr Winthorpe,
but the IRS has frozen your accounts.

539
00:51:48,849 --> 00:51:50,851
What? You know me.

540
00:51:50,976 --> 00:51:53,229
You're a heroin dealer, Mr Winthorpe.

541
00:51:53,354 --> 00:51:57,024
It wasn't heroin, it was angel dust - PCP
and I never touched it.

542
00:51:57,149 --> 00:52:01,696
Regardless, it's not the kind of business
we want at First National.

543
00:52:03,239 --> 00:52:05,449
May I see your credit cards please?

544
00:52:10,663 --> 00:52:13,165
- I've been ordered to repossess them.
- What?

545
00:52:13,290 --> 00:52:17,962
Wait, what am I supposed to live on?
What's going to happen to me?

546
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:20,589
Roger.

547
00:52:33,519 --> 00:52:36,772
Why is someone
deliberately trying to ruin my life?

548
00:52:36,897 --> 00:52:39,692
Tell you what. Forget about the $50, OK?

549
00:52:39,817 --> 00:52:41,902
I'm just real tired. I'm going home.

550
00:52:43,779 --> 00:52:47,241
You've got to believe me.
You must believe me.

551
00:52:47,366 --> 00:52:50,703
I have been framed.
You can't just leave me here.

552
00:52:50,828 --> 00:52:53,330
I've got enough problems, Louis.

553
00:52:57,293 --> 00:52:59,378
Come on, come on.

554
00:53:00,713 --> 00:53:02,590
Listen! Wait!

555
00:53:02,715 --> 00:53:03,841
Wait.

556
00:53:05,134 --> 00:53:09,972
I have over $150,000 in that bank.

557
00:53:10,890 --> 00:53:14,810
But you don't care because
you helped them do this to me.

558
00:53:22,151 --> 00:53:24,362
Get off your knees, Louis.

559
00:53:32,620 --> 00:53:34,705
Give me your hand.

560
00:53:37,666 --> 00:53:39,543
Soft hands.

561
00:53:40,628 --> 00:53:45,007
And a manicure. Never done a hard day's
work in your life, have you?

562
00:53:49,887 --> 00:53:52,598
I'm gonna regret this but...

563
00:53:52,723 --> 00:53:55,142
come on. Get in.

564
00:54:13,411 --> 00:54:17,581
I'm going to get to the bottom of this.
This has been a grave mistake.

565
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:21,168
Hey, that looks just like
the dude that had me busted.

566
00:54:21,293 --> 00:54:23,295
Sir?

567
00:54:23,421 --> 00:54:26,465
Right there,
he looked just like the mother...

568
00:54:26,590 --> 00:54:30,011
I mean, he looks just like
the gentleman that had me busted.

569
00:54:30,636 --> 00:54:32,471
To whom are you referring, sir?

570
00:54:32,596 --> 00:54:34,473
The dude right there.

571
00:54:36,392 --> 00:54:38,978
- Right over there.
- That's my car.

572
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:43,315
Coleman!
Coleman, that's my car!

573
00:54:43,441 --> 00:54:46,986
That's my car! That's my driver.

574
00:54:52,658 --> 00:54:54,952
There's some strange shit
going on here, Coleman.

575
00:54:55,911 --> 00:54:58,497
You don't want
to be late for your first day, sir.

576
00:55:06,172 --> 00:55:08,632
What do they want me to do here?

577
00:55:08,758 --> 00:55:12,470
- I'm sure they'll tell you.
- What if I can't do it?

578
00:55:13,346 --> 00:55:15,431
Just be yourself, sir.

579
00:55:15,556 --> 00:55:19,185
Whatever happens,
they can't take that away from you.

580
00:55:35,117 --> 00:55:37,828
- Excuse me, my name is...
- Mr Valentine.

581
00:55:37,953 --> 00:55:40,539
They're waiting in the last office
down the hall.

582
00:56:02,937 --> 00:56:07,942
- Ah, William, my boy. Right on time.
- Come in, come in.

583
00:56:10,444 --> 00:56:12,530
Sit down.

584
00:56:15,366 --> 00:56:18,285
No thanks, guys.
I already had breakfast.

585
00:56:18,411 --> 00:56:21,080
This is not a meal, Valentine.

586
00:56:21,205 --> 00:56:25,626
We are here to try to explain to you,
what it is we do here.

587
00:56:25,751 --> 00:56:28,671
We are commodities brokers, William.

588
00:56:28,796 --> 00:56:31,132
Now, what are commodities?

589
00:56:31,257 --> 00:56:34,176
Commodities are agricultural products.

590
00:56:34,301 --> 00:56:38,097
Like coffee, that you had for breakfast.

591
00:56:38,222 --> 00:56:40,975
Wheat, which is used to make bread.

592
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:43,394
Pork bellies, which is used to make bacon,

593
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:47,565
which you might find in a bacon,
lettuce and tomato sandwich.

594
00:56:49,108 --> 00:56:54,989
Then there are other commodities like...
frozen orange juice... and gold.

595
00:56:55,114 --> 00:56:59,785
Though, of course, gold
doesn't grow on trees like oranges.

596
00:57:01,162 --> 00:57:03,873
- Clear so far?
- Yeah.

597
00:57:03,998 --> 00:57:08,002
Good, William.
Now, some of our clients are speculating

598
00:57:08,127 --> 00:57:11,505
that the price of gold
will rise in the future.

599
00:57:11,630 --> 00:57:16,844
We have other clients who are speculating
that the price of gold is going to fall.

600
00:57:16,969 --> 00:57:19,764
They've placed their orders with us

601
00:57:19,889 --> 00:57:23,726
and we buy or sell their gold for them.

602
00:57:23,851 --> 00:57:26,645
Tell him the good part.

603
00:57:26,771 --> 00:57:32,193
The good part is that no matter whether
our clients make money,

604
00:57:32,318 --> 00:57:37,448
or lose money,
Duke & Duke get the commissions.

605
00:57:37,907 --> 00:57:40,534
Well, what do you think, Valentine?

606
00:57:42,661 --> 00:57:46,290
Sounds to me like you guys
are a couple of bookies.

607
00:57:46,415 --> 00:57:48,042
I told you he'd understand.

608
00:57:49,710 --> 00:57:53,547
It doesn't take a genius
to figure out what happened.

609
00:57:53,672 --> 00:57:58,094
It's the same guy who tried
to rob the payroll, no doubt, that's him.

610
00:57:58,219 --> 00:58:00,304
He planted the drugs on me.

611
00:58:00,429 --> 00:58:02,723
Rachim, Mohammed, Larry.
How are you guys doing?

612
00:58:02,848 --> 00:58:05,768
Hey, hey, how ya doing?

613
00:58:07,478 --> 00:58:09,563
You know those people?

614
00:58:21,784 --> 00:58:24,078
He was wearing my Harvard tie.

615
00:58:24,203 --> 00:58:28,666
Can you believe it? My Harvard tie.
Like, oh sure, he went to Harvard.

616
00:58:30,126 --> 00:58:35,589
If he's being driven around in my car,
he could actually be living in my house.

617
00:58:36,549 --> 00:58:38,843
Maybe he's even taken my job.

618
00:58:38,968 --> 00:58:43,347
For all I know, right at this moment
he could be fondling my fiancee.

619
00:58:43,931 --> 00:58:47,810
And Coleman -
after years of service, this betrayal.

620
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:50,021
I don't understand it.

621
00:58:50,646 --> 00:58:53,774
There's going to be retribution.
Oh, he's going to pay.

622
00:58:53,899 --> 00:58:56,527
- The things that I...
- Shut up, Louis.

623
00:58:56,652 --> 00:59:00,197
Taxis cost money,
food costs money and rent costs money!

624
00:59:00,322 --> 00:59:04,326
Now, you want me to help you out,
I expect a lot in return.

625
00:59:04,452 --> 00:59:08,622
These were here when I moved in.
Put 'em on if you want.

626
00:59:14,754 --> 00:59:20,009
Look, I cannot begin to tell you
how much I appreciate this...

627
00:59:20,134 --> 00:59:24,472
- Ophelia.
- Ophelia, you realise that's the name...

628
00:59:24,597 --> 00:59:27,850
I know, Hamlet's girlfriend.
He went crazy, she killed herself.

629
00:59:27,975 --> 00:59:30,895
This is not Shakespeare, Louis.

630
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:35,775
I'm 24. I'm from a small, miserable
mining town you probably never heard of.

631
00:59:37,151 --> 00:59:41,655
The only thing I've got going for me,
is this body, this face,

632
00:59:41,781 --> 00:59:43,866
and what I got up here.

633
00:59:53,542 --> 00:59:55,628
I don't do drugs.

634
00:59:55,753 --> 00:59:57,838
And I don't have a pimp.

635
00:59:59,465 --> 01:00:01,550
This place is a dump.

636
01:00:01,676 --> 01:00:05,054
But it's cheap,
it's clean and it's all mine.

637
01:00:05,179 --> 01:00:08,724
I've saved 42 grand
and it's in T-Bills earning interest.

638
01:00:08,849 --> 01:00:12,228
I've got three more years on my back.
I'll have enough to retire.

639
01:00:13,604 --> 01:00:15,898
You're a prostitute?

640
01:00:21,779 --> 01:00:24,615
I'm talking about
a business proposition, Louis.

641
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:29,912
I help you get back on your feet
and you pay me, in cash, five figures.

642
01:00:30,037 --> 01:00:33,165
That's the deal
and it's not subject to negotiation.

643
01:00:33,290 --> 01:00:35,376
Understood?

644
01:00:51,517 --> 01:00:56,355
By the way, food and rent are not
the only things here that cost money.

645
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:58,482
You sleep on the couch.

646
01:01:01,027 --> 01:01:03,195
It's hit rock bottom. Come on, let's buy.

647
01:01:04,822 --> 01:01:07,116
Buy 200 May belly contracts at 66.8.

648
01:01:07,241 --> 01:01:11,620
- Put them on my personal account.
- That's a big mistake, man.

649
01:01:11,746 --> 01:01:17,918
- Valentine, this is very important, watch.
- You're going to get reamed on this one.

650
01:01:18,044 --> 01:01:21,005
Why shouldn't we buy now, William?

651
01:01:21,130 --> 01:01:22,965
Price is going to keep going down.

652
01:01:25,092 --> 01:01:27,636
Randolph, this isn't
Monopoly money we're playing with.

653
01:01:30,181 --> 01:01:33,392
This is Randolph Duke.
Hold that belly over a moment.

654
01:01:34,643 --> 01:01:39,440
Tell me why you think
the price of pork bellies is going down.

655
01:01:39,565 --> 01:01:44,487
- It's Christmas time. Everybody's uptight.
- Could we please buy now?

656
01:01:44,612 --> 01:01:48,115
- If you want to lose money go ahead.
- What are you trying to say?

657
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:51,911
OK, pork belly prices
have been dropping all morning.

658
01:01:52,036 --> 01:01:56,791
So everybody's waiting for them
to hit rock bottom so they can buy cheap.

659
01:01:56,916 --> 01:01:59,835
The people with
pork belly contracts are thinking,

660
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:03,255
"Hey, we're losing all our money
and Christmas is coming.

661
01:02:03,381 --> 01:02:06,509
"I won't be able to buy my
son the GI Joe with the Kung Fu grip.

662
01:02:06,634 --> 01:02:10,805
"And my wife won't make love to me
cos I ain't got no money."

663
01:02:10,930 --> 01:02:13,516
They're panicking, screaming, "Sell, sell."

664
01:02:13,641 --> 01:02:18,104
They don't want to lose all their money.
They are panicking right now. I can feel it.

665
01:02:18,229 --> 01:02:19,939
Look at them.

666
01:02:20,064 --> 01:02:22,983
He's right, Mortimer, my God, look at it.

667
01:02:23,818 --> 01:02:26,320
I'd wait till you get to 64, then buy.

668
01:02:26,445 --> 01:02:28,948
You'll have cleared out
all the suckers by then.

669
01:02:30,032 --> 01:02:32,743
Do you realise how much money
he just saved us?

670
01:02:32,868 --> 01:02:35,371
Money isn't everything, Randolph.

671
01:02:38,082 --> 01:02:42,545
Advise our clients
interested in bellies to buy at 64.

672
01:02:42,670 --> 01:02:45,005
Mr Valentine has set the price.

673
01:02:47,383 --> 01:02:51,429
Well done, William.
Very well done.

674
01:02:51,554 --> 01:02:54,432
Come on, Randolph, we're gonna be late.

675
01:03:24,545 --> 01:03:28,299
Yo...
Mortimer dropped his money clip.

676
01:03:29,342 --> 01:03:32,470
- You can count it, it's all there.
- Thank you.

677
01:03:32,595 --> 01:03:37,516
- It's all there, count it.
- I'm sure it is. Keep up the good work.

678
01:03:37,641 --> 01:03:39,769
All right, Randy.

679
01:03:39,894 --> 01:03:41,979
Nice try, Mortimer.

680
01:04:35,950 --> 01:04:38,661
That was great, that was really great.

681
01:04:42,248 --> 01:04:45,167
...and she stepped on the ball.

682
01:04:47,795 --> 01:04:51,298
Oh my God, I don't believe it.

683
01:04:54,301 --> 01:04:58,514
- Ah, there you are.
- I think I'm going to be sick.

684
01:04:58,639 --> 01:05:00,725
Don't worry, I'll handle this, Pookums.

685
01:05:02,435 --> 01:05:04,520
Todd, Harry, Andrew, Philip.

686
01:05:04,645 --> 01:05:08,649
I realise this looks completely awful
but I just wanted to assure you,

687
01:05:08,774 --> 01:05:11,527
my friends, that I am completely innocent.

688
01:05:11,652 --> 01:05:16,032
I'm going to fight this.
Someone is out to get me and I know who.

689
01:05:16,157 --> 01:05:19,785
The important thing is
that I can rely on you,

690
01:05:19,910 --> 01:05:22,288
my friends, as character witnesses.

691
01:05:29,503 --> 01:05:31,630
I'm going to be defending myself

692
01:05:31,756 --> 01:05:35,259
and I wondered
if you could see your way clear

693
01:05:35,384 --> 01:05:40,181
to perhaps advance me
a small loan until the hearing.

694
01:05:42,016 --> 01:05:46,479
Frankly, Winthorpe,
and I think I speak for all of us,

695
01:05:46,604 --> 01:05:51,067
I think it shows incredibly bad taste
for you to embarrass us like this.

696
01:05:53,027 --> 01:05:55,279
I believe I'm still a member of this club.

697
01:05:57,239 --> 01:06:02,870
Nobody wants to buy your drugs, Louis.
Why don't you just go away?

698
01:06:16,175 --> 01:06:18,260
Burnt my fingers, man.

699
01:06:21,305 --> 01:06:23,391
I beg your pardon.

700
01:06:24,892 --> 01:06:27,812
Man, that watch is so hot, it's smokin'.

701
01:06:27,937 --> 01:06:31,774
Hot? Do you mean to imply, stolen?

702
01:06:31,899 --> 01:06:35,444
- I'll give you 50 bucks for it.
- 50 bucks!

703
01:06:35,986 --> 01:06:40,282
No, no, no. This is a Rochefoucauld, the
thinnest water-resistant watch in the world.

704
01:06:40,408 --> 01:06:43,077
Singularly unique, sculptured in design,

705
01:06:43,202 --> 01:06:47,998
hand-crafted in Switzerland
and water-resistant to three atmospheres.

706
01:06:48,124 --> 01:06:53,796
This is the sports watch of the '80s.
$6,955 retail.

707
01:06:53,921 --> 01:06:55,631
Got a receipt?

708
01:06:55,756 --> 01:06:58,050
Look, it tells time simultaneously

709
01:06:58,175 --> 01:07:01,512
in Monte Carlo, Beverly Hills, London,
Paris, Rome and Gstaad.

710
01:07:01,637 --> 01:07:05,933
In Philadelphia it's worth 50 bucks.

711
01:07:06,851 --> 01:07:08,936
Just give me the money.

712
01:07:21,991 --> 01:07:24,660
How much for the gun?

713
01:07:29,248 --> 01:07:33,002
So, this snail is standing
in front of the Cadillac salesman, see,

714
01:07:33,127 --> 01:07:36,672
and says,
"How much is that Cadillac?"

715
01:07:43,929 --> 01:07:47,975
The snail says,
"I want a big 'S' put on each door

716
01:07:48,100 --> 01:07:53,439
"and on top of the car, I want a big 'S'
so everybody can see it."

717
01:07:53,564 --> 01:07:57,902
Salesman says, "Why do you want that?"
He says, "When I drive down the avenue...

718
01:07:58,027 --> 01:08:02,698
"I want everybody to say
'Look at that S-car-go."'

719
01:08:09,413 --> 01:08:12,083
"Look at the S-car-go."

720
01:08:19,131 --> 01:08:23,469
I'm considering going long on April wheat.
What do you think, Valentine?

721
01:08:26,764 --> 01:08:30,518
I can think of three good reasons
why you shouldn't do that, judge.

722
01:08:30,643 --> 01:08:35,022
One, the Russian wheat harvest isn't going
to be as bad as people think... and two...

723
01:08:38,150 --> 01:08:41,278
...and three, judging by
the jewels around your girlfriend's neck,

724
01:08:41,404 --> 01:08:45,074
I think you're going to need every penny
just to keep her happy.

725
01:09:25,197 --> 01:09:28,868
103.
That's it, you're staying in bed.

726
01:09:28,993 --> 01:09:34,206
That man has moved into my house.
He's stolen my job. I have to do something.

727
01:09:36,333 --> 01:09:38,419
Stay here.

728
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:47,136
It's ten o'clock - here's Johnny.

729
01:09:47,261 --> 01:09:51,390
Listen, baby, I'm sorry.
My momma just came in from outta town.

730
01:09:51,515 --> 01:09:53,601
Can we do it next week?

731
01:09:57,396 --> 01:09:59,482
Flowers for me?

732
01:09:59,607 --> 01:10:01,275
Thanks.

733
01:10:05,946 --> 01:10:08,741
- What are you doing?
- You've got company.

734
01:10:08,866 --> 01:10:11,369
Business is business.
I'll go for a walk.

735
01:10:11,494 --> 01:10:14,622
- Fresh air will do me good.
- Lay down.

736
01:10:19,126 --> 01:10:22,254
I'm sorry you had to cancel
your appointment.

737
01:10:25,007 --> 01:10:27,093
What are you doing?

738
01:10:40,981 --> 01:10:44,360
Ophelia, I can't tell you
how good that feels.

739
01:10:45,236 --> 01:10:47,947
You've been so kind to me.

740
01:10:48,072 --> 01:10:51,534
I'm just protecting my investment.
That's all.

741
01:10:53,577 --> 01:10:55,663
Shut up and go to sleep.

742
01:11:10,845 --> 01:11:14,390
99 and a half. You're not
getting out of bed until it's normal.

743
01:11:14,515 --> 01:11:17,226
I feel fine and I've
inconvenienced you enough.

744
01:11:17,351 --> 01:11:20,021
You have work to do and so do I.

745
01:11:20,146 --> 01:11:22,231
Nobody works on Christmas Eve.

746
01:11:22,356 --> 01:11:26,444
I'm going shopping
and then I'll make you a nice quiet dinner.

747
01:11:26,569 --> 01:11:28,654
Now, read your paper.

748
01:11:44,295 --> 01:11:48,549
Christmas! I'll give him a Christmas
present he'll never forget.

749
01:13:15,803 --> 01:13:18,723
Ah William, where've you been?
The party's already begun.

750
01:13:18,848 --> 01:13:20,933
I have some work to finish.

751
01:13:21,058 --> 01:13:24,186
It's Christmas Eve
and William wants to keep working.

752
01:13:25,438 --> 01:13:28,858
I'll think of you in Stockholm,
when I accept the Nobel Prize.

753
01:13:28,983 --> 01:13:33,487
The wager has two parts - something
about a second party turning to crime.

754
01:13:37,199 --> 01:13:39,744
Didn't you say you had work to do?

755
01:13:39,869 --> 01:13:44,373
Yes sir. I was wondering about this
$10,000 cheque to Mr Clarence Beeks.

756
01:13:44,498 --> 01:13:46,584
I'll take care of it, Valentine.

757
01:13:46,709 --> 01:13:49,628
I don't recall a Clarence Beeks, Mr Duke.

758
01:13:49,754 --> 01:13:52,256
It was before you joined us, Valentine.

759
01:13:52,381 --> 01:13:57,053
We did manage to stay in business
for 47 years before your arrival.

760
01:13:57,553 --> 01:14:00,473
Have a drink, William.
Merry Christmas.

761
01:14:00,598 --> 01:14:03,726
- Merry Christmas, Mr Duke.
- What?

762
01:14:03,851 --> 01:14:06,896
- Merry Christmas.
- Oh, oh, Merry Christmas.

763
01:14:17,406 --> 01:14:21,035
Ho, ho, ho!

764
01:14:31,921 --> 01:14:34,006
Just what do you think you're doing?

765
01:14:34,548 --> 01:14:38,928
Randolph, Mortimer, come in here quickly,
I've finally caught him.

766
01:14:42,181 --> 01:14:44,809
- Who are you?
- I've caught him red-handed.

767
01:14:44,934 --> 01:14:47,019
Winthorpe, is that you?

768
01:14:47,144 --> 01:14:50,898
I'm making a citizen's arrest.
This man is a drug dealer.

769
01:14:51,023 --> 01:14:54,110
Look, his office drawer,
he's got all the bad drugs here.

770
01:14:54,235 --> 01:14:57,154
Marijuana joints, pills, Quaaludes,

771
01:14:57,279 --> 01:15:01,742
Valium, yellow ones, red ones,
cocaine grinder, drug needles.

772
01:15:01,867 --> 01:15:04,036
He's the pusher, not me.

773
01:15:04,161 --> 01:15:07,248
I just came in
and caught him planting this stuff.

774
01:15:07,373 --> 01:15:10,292
It's obviously
some primitive attempt to frame me.

775
01:15:10,418 --> 01:15:15,006
Frame you? Boy, if that
isn't the pot calling the kettle black.

776
01:15:15,131 --> 01:15:18,009
This man's obviously a lunatic.
I'm calling security.

777
01:15:19,176 --> 01:15:21,262
Put that phone down.

778
01:15:22,930 --> 01:15:26,267
Hello, security...
Merry Christmas.

779
01:15:28,644 --> 01:15:31,063
You tried to rob me,
plant drugs on me.

780
01:15:31,188 --> 01:15:35,276
You steal my house, my car, my job.
I ought to kill him now.

781
01:15:35,401 --> 01:15:37,486
Look, this is a big misunderstanding.

782
01:15:37,611 --> 01:15:41,449
I don't know nothing about it.
Could you put the gun away?

783
01:15:41,574 --> 01:15:45,369
Put that gun away at once, Winthorpe.
Have you lost your mind?

784
01:15:46,620 --> 01:15:48,122
Freeze, slime ball.

785
01:15:50,249 --> 01:15:55,629
I realise this whole experience
must have been rather unsettling for you.

786
01:15:55,755 --> 01:15:57,882
Winthorpe, don't leave. We can explain.

787
01:15:58,549 --> 01:16:01,260
Yeah, you'll be sorry.

788
01:16:03,721 --> 01:16:07,141
You'll all be very, very sorry.

789
01:16:29,497 --> 01:16:33,584
Poor, deluded creature.
We caught him pilfering at our club,

790
01:16:33,709 --> 01:16:37,171
embezzling funds, selling drugs.

791
01:16:37,296 --> 01:16:39,715
Now he's dressing up like Santa Claus.

792
01:16:40,633 --> 01:16:42,718
Very sordid business.

793
01:16:42,843 --> 01:16:46,555
I can't believe Winthorpe
would fall to pieces like that.

794
01:16:46,806 --> 01:16:49,100
It's not my business,
but he belongs behind bars.

795
01:16:49,225 --> 01:16:52,687
- He's unemployed, Valentine.
- It's no excuse, Mortimer.

796
01:16:52,812 --> 01:16:55,398
He's flat broke, obviously hungry.

797
01:16:55,523 --> 01:16:57,775
But he has money to buy drugs, right?

798
01:16:57,900 --> 01:17:01,987
You can't be soft on people like that.
Take it from me, Randolph.

799
01:18:07,595 --> 01:18:09,930
Pay up, Mortimer, I've won the bet.

800
01:18:12,350 --> 01:18:15,019
Here, one dollar.

801
01:18:17,271 --> 01:18:22,443
We took a perfectly useless
psychopath, like Valentine,

802
01:18:22,568 --> 01:18:26,405
and turned him
into a successful executive.

803
01:18:27,531 --> 01:18:29,617
And during the same time,

804
01:18:29,742 --> 01:18:33,871
we turned an honest, hard-working man

805
01:18:33,996 --> 01:18:38,292
into a violently deranged, would-be killer.

806
01:18:40,544 --> 01:18:43,923
Now, what are we going to do
about taking Winthorpe back

807
01:18:44,048 --> 01:18:46,133
and returning Valentine to the ghetto?

808
01:18:46,258 --> 01:18:49,553
I don't want Winthorpe back
after what he's done.

809
01:18:50,638 --> 01:18:54,475
You mean keep Valentine on,
as Managing Director?

810
01:18:55,643 --> 01:19:00,606
Do you really believe I would have a nigger
run our family business, Randolph?

811
01:19:00,731 --> 01:19:03,943
Of course not. Neither would I.

812
01:19:04,610 --> 01:19:07,738
I do think we should hold off
on switching them back, though.

813
01:19:07,863 --> 01:19:10,991
Until we get that crop report,
New Year's Eve, don't you?

814
01:19:11,117 --> 01:19:13,786
Absolutely, no sense
rocking the boat until then.

815
01:19:13,911 --> 01:19:17,623
If Mr Beeks does what we paid him to do,

816
01:19:17,748 --> 01:19:21,043
we should have a very happy New Year.

817
01:19:21,168 --> 01:19:23,254
Indeed.

818
01:19:41,814 --> 01:19:44,567
Hey, Winthorpe, Winthorpe.

819
01:19:52,408 --> 01:19:53,492
Hey.

820
01:20:15,890 --> 01:20:18,809
Hey, Winthorpe.
Yo, Winthorpe.

821
01:20:19,935 --> 01:20:22,355
Winthorpe. Yo.

822
01:20:25,816 --> 01:20:27,902
Sorry about that.

823
01:20:41,916 --> 01:20:44,001
Yo! Yo!

824
01:20:45,336 --> 01:20:47,421
Hey, Taxi!

825
01:22:44,789 --> 01:22:46,999
Hi, Louis. Merry Christmas.

826
01:22:51,504 --> 01:22:53,923
Louis, I have a big surprise for you.

827
01:22:55,341 --> 01:23:00,262
Excuse me. The door was open...
I'm looking for a Louis Winthorpe.

828
01:23:00,388 --> 01:23:04,225
- Does he live here?
- Wait here a minute, I'll be right back.

829
01:23:08,729 --> 01:23:11,732
Louis, Louis. It's him. It's Valentine.

830
01:23:12,942 --> 01:23:16,070
Louis... Louis?

831
01:23:21,367 --> 01:23:22,910
Louis.

832
01:23:24,578 --> 01:23:26,997
It was close but he's going to be all right.

833
01:23:27,123 --> 01:23:29,917
Now, make sure he gets plenty of rest.

834
01:23:30,042 --> 01:23:32,253
And for God's sake, no excitement.

835
01:23:33,921 --> 01:23:36,007
Thanks, Doc. Merry Christmas.

836
01:23:36,132 --> 01:23:39,260
Merry Christmas to you.
I'll let myself out, Coleman. Thank you.

837
01:23:39,385 --> 01:23:41,470
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

838
01:23:49,311 --> 01:23:53,190
It was a dream.
I dreamt the whole thing.

839
01:23:53,315 --> 01:23:55,401
It was just a bad dream.

840
01:23:55,526 --> 01:23:57,570
Good morning, sir.

841
01:23:57,695 --> 01:23:59,280
Merry Christmas.

842
01:23:59,405 --> 01:24:03,200
Coleman, I've had
the most absurd nightmare.

843
01:24:03,325 --> 01:24:05,870
I was poor and no one liked me.

844
01:24:05,995 --> 01:24:09,915
I lost my job, I lost my house.
Penelope hated me.

845
01:24:10,708 --> 01:24:13,669
And it was all because
of this terrible, awful Negro.

846
01:24:17,548 --> 01:24:21,427
- Oh dear!
- It... was... the... Dukes.

847
01:24:21,552 --> 01:24:24,055
You're a dead man, Valentine.

848
01:24:25,514 --> 01:24:29,560
It was an experiment.
They used us as guinea pigs, man.

849
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:34,774
The Dukes used us as guinea pigs.

850
01:24:34,899 --> 01:24:38,194
To see how our lives would turn out.
They made a bet.

851
01:24:38,319 --> 01:24:41,238
- I'm afraid it's true, sir.
- I believe him, Louis.

852
01:24:41,364 --> 01:24:46,369
The Dukes ruined my life over a bet?

853
01:24:46,494 --> 01:24:50,998
- For how much?
- A dollar.

854
01:24:52,333 --> 01:24:54,418
One dollar.

855
01:24:55,419 --> 01:24:58,547
Fine, that's the way they want it.

856
01:24:59,965 --> 01:25:01,300
No problem.

857
01:25:03,844 --> 01:25:07,473
You can't just shoot people
with a double-barrelled shotgun

858
01:25:07,598 --> 01:25:09,684
cos you're pissed at them.

859
01:25:09,809 --> 01:25:12,853
- Why not?
- It's assault with a deadly weapon.

860
01:25:12,978 --> 01:25:15,314
You get 20 years for that shit.

861
01:25:15,439 --> 01:25:17,525
Do you have any better ideas?

862
01:25:17,650 --> 01:25:22,655
Yeah, it seems the best way to hurt rich
people is by turning 'em into poor people.

863
01:25:24,156 --> 01:25:27,743
You have to admit,
you didn't like it yourself a bit.

864
01:25:27,868 --> 01:25:30,996
Under heavy security,

865
01:25:31,122 --> 01:25:34,875
the crop estimates
for next year's orange crop

866
01:25:35,001 --> 01:25:38,921
are being delivered to the Department
Of Agriculture in Washington DC.

867
01:25:39,088 --> 01:25:43,217
Louis, Louis, that's him,
the guy who paid me to talk dirty to you.

868
01:25:43,342 --> 01:25:47,013
In charge of security, Mr Clarence Beeks
of Lyndhurst Security.

869
01:25:47,179 --> 01:25:49,223
Clarence Beeks.

870
01:25:49,348 --> 01:25:54,061
- The Dukes gave him 10 grand.
- I saw 50,000 in the payroll.

871
01:25:54,186 --> 01:25:56,439
Mortimer said it was for research.

872
01:25:56,564 --> 01:26:01,569
Research, so he can get that top secret
report, two days before it goes public.

873
01:26:01,694 --> 01:26:06,824
Oh my God, the Dukes will corner
the entire frozen orange juice market.

874
01:26:06,949 --> 01:26:09,160
Unless somebody stops them.

875
01:26:09,285 --> 01:26:11,996
Or beats them to it.

876
01:26:12,121 --> 01:26:13,789
Eggnog?

877
01:26:13,914 --> 01:26:16,584
Duke & Duke, may I ask who's calling?

878
01:26:16,709 --> 01:26:19,837
Duke & Duke, he's busy.
Can you hold please?

879
01:26:19,962 --> 01:26:23,632
May I help you? One moment,
Mr Beeks, I'll put you right through.

880
01:26:31,640 --> 01:26:36,395
Operation "strange fruit"
proceeding according to plan.

881
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:42,026
I anticipate penetration and acquisition
at 21:00 tomorrow. Hold on.

882
01:26:42,485 --> 01:26:44,570
Fuck off!

883
01:26:44,695 --> 01:26:49,658
- When can we expect delivery?
- I will be leaving DC by train.

884
01:26:49,784 --> 01:26:55,456
Will rendezvous at 24:00 at the
Hilton Hotel, parking level D, Section 4.

885
01:26:55,581 --> 01:26:58,334
That's the orange section.

886
01:26:58,459 --> 01:27:00,753
Orange, I like that, very good.

887
01:27:00,878 --> 01:27:03,839
The final payment is due on delivery,
in cash.

888
01:27:17,353 --> 01:27:19,188
Jesus, hey!

889
01:27:19,647 --> 01:27:21,732
Happy New Year!

890
01:27:54,849 --> 01:28:00,062
- Ever make it with an ape?
- Harvey, haven't you had enough drink?

891
01:28:00,229 --> 01:28:02,773
Are you kidding,
it's not even New Year's Eve.

892
01:28:02,940 --> 01:28:05,359
Come here, kiss this beautiful ape.

893
01:28:05,484 --> 01:28:07,862
Come on.

894
01:28:08,946 --> 01:28:11,032
Harrisburg Express...

895
01:28:18,873 --> 01:28:21,667
- What?
- It's my turn to drive.

896
01:28:23,669 --> 01:28:26,005
- No it isn't.
- It is.

897
01:28:26,130 --> 01:28:29,925
- I'm sure you think it is, but it isn't.
- Don't you remember?

898
01:28:30,051 --> 01:28:32,678
You drove the shipment of anchovies.

899
01:28:32,803 --> 01:28:37,308
Yeah, but you had the video tape
recorders this afternoon.

900
01:28:39,393 --> 01:28:41,479
I backed them up about five feet.

901
01:28:41,604 --> 01:28:45,775
We take turns. Sometimes it's longer,
sometimes shorter. It's my turn now.

902
01:28:45,900 --> 01:28:48,444
- No it isn't.
- Yes it is.

903
01:28:55,743 --> 01:28:59,413
- Merry New Year.
- Happy New Year.

904
01:28:59,538 --> 01:29:01,666
In this country, we say, "Happy New Year".

905
01:29:04,710 --> 01:29:07,088
Thank you for correcting my English,
which stinks.

906
01:29:07,213 --> 01:29:11,801
I am Naga Eboko,
exchange student from Cameroon.

907
01:29:41,080 --> 01:29:43,165
Beef jerky time.

908
01:29:43,749 --> 01:29:47,086
- You want some beef jerky?
- No, please.

909
01:29:47,753 --> 01:29:49,463
There's plenty, you know.

910
01:29:50,047 --> 01:29:52,425
This animal's being
routed through to New York.

911
01:29:52,550 --> 01:29:55,720
Its care and feeding instructions
are on this bill of lading.

912
01:29:55,845 --> 01:29:57,930
OK, gotcha.

913
01:29:58,055 --> 01:30:01,892
I doubt you'll have need it but, there's
a tranquilliser gun in the First Aid kit.

914
01:30:03,185 --> 01:30:07,732
- Oh, yeah?
- Say, have you guys been drinking?

915
01:30:07,857 --> 01:30:11,485
- No, sir. Not us.
- There's enough drunks here already.

916
01:30:16,032 --> 01:30:18,200
Happy New Year.

917
01:30:18,325 --> 01:30:22,413
That's kind of you, son.
A Happy New Year to you, too.

918
01:30:22,538 --> 01:30:27,501
Could I offer either of you two gentlemen
a wee jolt of Irish whisky,

919
01:30:27,626 --> 01:30:29,920
to usher in the New Year.

920
01:30:30,046 --> 01:30:32,131
Not for me, pal.

921
01:30:33,674 --> 01:30:36,802
I do not drink. It is against my religion.

922
01:30:36,927 --> 01:30:41,432
I always say, religion's a fine thing,
taken in moderation.

923
01:30:41,557 --> 01:30:43,642
Beef jerky?

924
01:30:43,768 --> 01:30:46,729
No son, it gives me wind,
something terrible.

925
01:30:50,941 --> 01:30:53,027
We are moving! We are moving!

926
01:30:57,323 --> 01:31:00,451
New York, here we come!

927
01:31:13,005 --> 01:31:15,341
Come in, my child, join the party.

928
01:31:15,466 --> 01:31:19,595
Let me see, you would be from Austria.
Am I right?

929
01:31:19,720 --> 01:31:23,808
- No, I am Inga from Sweden.
- Sweden?

930
01:31:23,933 --> 01:31:27,103
But you're wearing <i>Lederhosen.</i>

931
01:31:28,145 --> 01:31:30,356
<i>Ja,</i> for sure, from Sweden.

932
01:31:35,111 --> 01:31:37,321
Please, help me with my rucksack.

933
01:31:39,156 --> 01:31:41,242
Oh yeah, sure, why not?

934
01:32:09,562 --> 01:32:13,190
I'm hungry, man.
I've got to get something more to eat.

935
01:32:13,315 --> 01:32:17,153
Well, maybe there's
some pretzels in the bar car.

936
01:32:34,462 --> 01:32:36,422
You're welcome!

937
01:32:48,225 --> 01:32:51,354
- Who is that?
- Open the door, man.

938
01:32:58,611 --> 01:33:02,156
I'm dressed as a baggage handler.

939
01:33:02,281 --> 01:33:07,161
Imagine how embarrassed I was that
someone had the same costume I had!

940
01:33:08,037 --> 01:33:12,375
Monkey, monkey?
I'm a fucking gorilla you clown!

941
01:33:12,875 --> 01:33:17,129
I certainly hope there's
enough space on the train for me.

942
01:33:18,047 --> 01:33:21,425
Naga, Naga Eboko, from Cameroon.

943
01:33:21,550 --> 01:33:24,178
Do you remember me? It's Lionel Joseph.

944
01:33:25,429 --> 01:33:30,101
Lionel, from the African Education
Conference, right?

945
01:33:30,226 --> 01:33:34,980
I was Director of Cultural Events
at the Haile Selassie Pavilion.

946
01:33:35,106 --> 01:33:37,775
I remember
we have big fun there.

947
01:33:53,541 --> 01:33:56,585
Now we are all here,
we will have a picnic, <i>ja?</i>

948
01:33:56,711 --> 01:34:00,840
You will help me get my rucksack down
for the Swedish meatballs.

949
01:34:05,094 --> 01:34:07,596
- Remember the one we did?
- Yeah.

950
01:34:13,102 --> 01:34:16,480
- The memories.
- All day long I could tell those stories.

951
01:34:16,605 --> 01:34:19,734
- Those were good ones.
- The good old days.

952
01:34:19,859 --> 01:34:22,153
- There you are, sweet pea.
<i>- Danke.</i>

953
01:34:25,656 --> 01:34:28,826
So, the train will be
pulling into Philadelphia soon.

954
01:34:28,951 --> 01:34:31,996
Will you be getting off
at the city of brotherly love?

955
01:34:32,121 --> 01:34:34,415
I will but you won't...

956
01:34:35,708 --> 01:34:37,793
...Winthorpe.

957
01:34:37,918 --> 01:34:40,212
- See if this one's empty.
- Hey, back off.

958
01:34:40,338 --> 01:34:43,424
I'll rip out your eyes
and piss on your brain.

959
01:34:43,549 --> 01:34:45,885
- Excuse me.
- You got it.

960
01:34:47,386 --> 01:34:49,847
All right. On your feet. Up! Let's go.

961
01:34:49,972 --> 01:34:53,100
Bunch of fucking weirdos!
We're going to take a little walk.

962
01:34:53,225 --> 01:34:56,312
Don't try anything funny
or the whore loses a kidney.

963
01:35:24,298 --> 01:35:27,093
- No, I'm from Sweden.
- Beat it.

964
01:35:27,218 --> 01:35:31,847
Hey, I'm King Kong,
the biggest, baddest guy in the jungle.

965
01:35:31,972 --> 01:35:34,058
Get lost, you maggot.

966
01:35:35,184 --> 01:35:38,145
Hey, who is that guy,
your father or something?

967
01:35:43,025 --> 01:35:45,111
All right, hold it right here.

968
01:35:45,236 --> 01:35:47,780
- Honestly, Beeks.
- This is as far as we go.

969
01:35:48,989 --> 01:35:51,409
No more cockamamie cigar smoke.

970
01:35:51,534 --> 01:35:54,370
No more Swedish meatballs there, tootsie.

971
01:35:54,912 --> 01:35:58,207
And no more phoney Irish whisky.

972
01:35:58,332 --> 01:36:00,584
No more goddamn jerky beef.

973
01:36:01,293 --> 01:36:03,379
The party's over.

974
01:36:03,504 --> 01:36:07,133
The party's over. Hey, come on.

975
01:36:07,258 --> 01:36:09,343
What do you mean, "The party's over"?

976
01:36:09,468 --> 01:36:12,346
It's not even ten o'clock, you dummy.

977
01:36:12,471 --> 01:36:15,099
Hey, come on. Loosen up, man.

978
01:36:15,224 --> 01:36:17,309
It's almost New Year's Eve.

979
01:36:49,592 --> 01:36:52,261
Hey, look what happened to me!

980
01:37:01,604 --> 01:37:04,315
Sometimes, they look so human,
it gives you the creeps.

981
01:37:06,817 --> 01:37:10,112
Boy, that other one's
getting kinda horny, ain't he?

982
01:37:10,237 --> 01:37:13,616
Think we ought to hit him up
with the tranquilliser gun?

983
01:37:13,741 --> 01:37:15,826
It's New Year's. Let 'em have their fun.

984
01:37:18,871 --> 01:37:21,415
That black one must be the female.

985
01:37:39,517 --> 01:37:44,271
- Where is he?
- Beeks. Are you there, Beeks?

986
01:37:51,278 --> 01:37:53,406
I'm over here.

987
01:37:57,493 --> 01:37:59,912
That's far enough.

988
01:38:00,037 --> 01:38:02,123
Did you get the report?

989
01:38:03,249 --> 01:38:05,584
Let's see the money.

990
01:38:13,759 --> 01:38:15,845
OK, toss it over.

991
01:38:27,606 --> 01:38:29,692
Thank you, Beeks.

992
01:38:39,869 --> 01:38:43,873
Wonderful news. Wonderful.

993
01:38:43,998 --> 01:38:47,335
Beeks, Happy New Year.

994
01:38:58,888 --> 01:39:03,267
My life savings. Try not to lose it.

995
01:39:03,392 --> 01:39:07,730
Lose it? In a couple of hours, you're going
to be the richest butler that ever lived.

996
01:39:12,360 --> 01:39:16,030
I worked real hard for this, Louis.
Hope you know what you're doing.

997
01:39:17,323 --> 01:39:20,242
- Thank you, Ophelia.
- What are you doing?

998
01:39:22,161 --> 01:39:24,246
10:31...

999
01:39:24,372 --> 01:39:26,457
That's us, Louis.

1000
01:39:31,921 --> 01:39:34,173
Coleman, would you please.

1001
01:39:34,298 --> 01:39:36,384
Thank you.

1002
01:40:14,547 --> 01:40:19,218
I could use a stiff drink.
Would you care to join me?

1003
01:40:45,745 --> 01:40:48,456
- Morning, Mr Duke.
- Wilson.

1004
01:40:48,581 --> 01:40:50,666
- Good morning, Mr Duke.
- Wilson.

1005
01:41:03,220 --> 01:41:05,306
Keep the change.

1006
01:41:06,432 --> 01:41:09,727
Think big, think positive.
Never show any sign of weakness.

1007
01:41:09,852 --> 01:41:15,024
Always go for the throat. Buy low, sell high.
Fear, that's the other guy's problem.

1008
01:41:15,149 --> 01:41:19,612
Nothing can prepare you for the unbridled
carnage you are about to witness.

1009
01:41:19,737 --> 01:41:21,822
The Super Bowl, the World Series.

1010
01:41:21,947 --> 01:41:26,994
Pressure? Here it's kill or be killed.
Make no friends and take no prisoners.

1011
01:41:27,119 --> 01:41:30,247
One minute you're up half a million,
the next, boom.

1012
01:41:30,373 --> 01:41:32,917
Your kids don't go to college
and you've lost your Bentley.

1013
01:41:33,042 --> 01:41:36,504
We've got to kill the motherfucker...
We've got to kill them.

1014
01:41:36,629 --> 01:41:40,675
We want you to buy as much OJ
as you can, the instant trading starts.

1015
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:44,595
Don't worry if the price starts going up,
just keep buying.

1016
01:41:44,720 --> 01:41:47,515
They'll broadcast the crop report
in an hour, what if...

1017
01:41:47,640 --> 01:41:49,892
Let us worry about that, Wilson.

1018
01:41:53,771 --> 01:41:55,022
Yes, sir.

1019
01:41:58,567 --> 01:42:04,198
- How's the ulcer, Harry?
- Pretty good. How's the hypertension?

1020
01:42:04,323 --> 01:42:06,409
Hasn't bothered me in months.

1021
01:42:34,395 --> 01:42:36,480
Let's kick some ass.

1022
01:42:57,626 --> 01:43:01,672
This is it. The last
bastion of pure capitalism left on earth.

1023
01:43:01,797 --> 01:43:06,218
Here in New York they trade everything,
gold, silver, platinum,

1024
01:43:06,344 --> 01:43:09,263
heating oil, propane, cocoa and sugar

1025
01:43:09,388 --> 01:43:11,849
and, of course,
frozen, concentrated orange juice.

1026
01:43:11,974 --> 01:43:16,020
The people on the phones are taking
orders from brokers all over the world.

1027
01:43:16,145 --> 01:43:20,649
The runners hand those
orders to the traders in the pits.

1028
01:43:24,653 --> 01:43:28,199
They're trading cotton over there.
And that's the silver pit.

1029
01:43:28,908 --> 01:43:32,244
The Dukes' trader is going to be
buying like crazy right from the opening.

1030
01:43:32,370 --> 01:43:34,455
We wait until he drives the price up?

1031
01:43:34,580 --> 01:43:39,168
Right. I can't wait to see his face, when
they broadcast that genuine crop report.

1032
01:43:39,293 --> 01:43:41,379
OJ trading opens at 9:00.

1033
01:43:41,504 --> 01:43:44,423
- Let's go kick some butt.
- Let's go.

1034
01:44:46,152 --> 01:44:49,613
Hey, hey. The Dukes
are trying to corner the market.

1035
01:44:49,739 --> 01:44:52,867
- They know something.
- Let's get in on it.

1036
01:44:53,909 --> 01:44:55,494
200, taken.

1037
01:44:55,619 --> 01:44:59,749
- 130.
- 200, 200.

1038
01:44:59,915 --> 01:45:02,001
Louis.

1039
01:45:02,126 --> 01:45:04,211
Not yet, almost.

1040
01:45:04,545 --> 01:45:06,714
- 220 taken.
- 209.

1041
01:45:06,839 --> 01:45:10,009
- Yeah, yeah, got 'em.
- 139.

1042
01:45:13,929 --> 01:45:17,808
Now!
Sell, 200 April at 142.

1043
01:45:31,989 --> 01:45:36,160
That's not right.
How can the price be going down?

1044
01:45:36,285 --> 01:45:38,996
Something's wrong. Where's Wilson?

1045
01:45:41,415 --> 01:45:43,501
What are they doing here?

1046
01:45:43,626 --> 01:45:47,546
- They're selling, Mortimer.
- Why, that's ridiculous.

1047
01:45:49,340 --> 01:45:54,845
- Unless that crop report...
- God help us.

1048
01:46:05,064 --> 01:46:08,484
I told you we shouldn't have
committed everything, you asshole.

1049
01:46:08,609 --> 01:46:12,780
We've got to get Wilson and tell him to sell.

1050
01:46:38,764 --> 01:46:40,224
Ladies and gentlemen,

1051
01:46:40,349 --> 01:46:42,268
the Secretary Of Agriculture.

1052
01:46:52,445 --> 01:46:56,866
Ladies and gentlemen, the
orange crop estimates for the next year.

1053
01:47:11,005 --> 01:47:15,551
After calculating the estimates from
various orange producing states,

1054
01:47:15,676 --> 01:47:17,720
We have concluded the following...

1055
01:47:18,137 --> 01:47:22,224
The cold winter has apparently
not effected the orange harvest.

1056
01:47:27,813 --> 01:47:32,485
...consumers can expect
orange juice prices to fall...

1057
01:47:39,659 --> 01:47:41,786
Wilson, for Christ's sake, sell.

1058
01:47:53,547 --> 01:47:55,424
Buy 'em.

1059
01:48:30,042 --> 01:48:32,128
Wilson, where are you going?

1060
01:48:32,253 --> 01:48:36,841
You idiot. Get back in there at once
and sell, sell.

1061
01:48:49,979 --> 01:48:52,064
- Five.
- Yeah, 200.

1062
01:48:52,189 --> 01:48:55,109
- 100.
- Yeah, that was 100.

1063
01:48:55,234 --> 01:48:58,237
Did you get that?

1064
01:49:14,962 --> 01:49:17,048
Happy New Year.

1065
01:49:18,924 --> 01:49:22,094
- Winthorpe.
- Valentine.

1066
01:49:22,219 --> 01:49:26,140
- How'd you make out today?
- How could you do this to us,

1067
01:49:26,265 --> 01:49:28,351
after everything we've done for you?

1068
01:49:28,476 --> 01:49:31,604
Oh, see I made Louis a bet here.

1069
01:49:31,729 --> 01:49:35,566
Louis bet me that we couldn't get rich
and put you in the poorhouse.

1070
01:49:35,691 --> 01:49:38,611
He didn't think we could do it. I won.

1071
01:49:38,736 --> 01:49:40,821
I lost.

1072
01:49:41,280 --> 01:49:44,200
- One dollar.
- Thank you, Louis.

1073
01:49:45,743 --> 01:49:47,828
- After you.
- Certainly.

1074
01:49:51,916 --> 01:49:54,001
Margin call, gentlemen.

1075
01:49:54,126 --> 01:49:56,671
- Why you can't expect...
- You know the rules.

1076
01:49:56,796 --> 01:50:01,926
All accounts to be settled at the
end of the day's trading, without exception.

1077
01:50:02,051 --> 01:50:06,347
You know perfectly well,
we don't have $394 million in cash.

1078
01:50:06,472 --> 01:50:11,602
I'm sorry, boys. Put the Duke brothers'
seats on the exchange up for sale at once.

1079
01:50:11,727 --> 01:50:15,106
Seize all assets of Duke & Duke
Commodity Brokers,

1080
01:50:15,231 --> 01:50:18,943
as well as all personal holdings
of Randolph and Mortimer Duke.

1081
01:50:19,068 --> 01:50:22,238
We're ruined!

1082
01:50:22,363 --> 01:50:25,199
This is an outrage,
I demand an investigation.

1083
01:50:25,324 --> 01:50:29,954
You can't sell our seats. A Duke has been
on this exchange since it was founded.

1084
01:50:30,079 --> 01:50:32,456
We founded this exchange. It's ours.

1085
01:50:32,581 --> 01:50:34,667
It belongs to us.

1086
01:50:35,710 --> 01:50:37,753
We'd better call your brother
an ambulance.

1087
01:50:37,878 --> 01:50:41,424
Fuck him!
I want trading reopened, right now.

1088
01:50:41,549 --> 01:50:45,553
Get those brokers back in here.
Turn those machines back on.

1089
01:50:45,678 --> 01:50:48,597
Turn those machines back on.

1090
01:50:52,852 --> 01:50:56,647
You and your Nobel Prize, you idiot.

1091
01:50:56,772 --> 01:50:59,608
Where's Beeks? Where in hell is Beeks?

1092
01:50:59,734 --> 01:51:02,403
- Beeks!
- Yeah, I forgot all about that guy.

1093
01:51:11,787 --> 01:51:14,332
OK, one male gorilla.

1094
01:51:14,457 --> 01:51:17,126
Wait a minute.
There's two of them in that cage.

1095
01:51:17,251 --> 01:51:21,130
One gorilla, two gorillas. Big deal.
Whole bunch is getting sent back to Africa.

1096
01:51:21,255 --> 01:51:25,760
It's a big scientific experiment.
What do I know? Anyway, they're in love.

1097
01:51:46,739 --> 01:51:49,617
- Hey, Coleman.
- Yes.

1098
01:51:50,993 --> 01:51:53,788
What about lunch?
The lobster or the cracked crab?

1099
01:51:53,913 --> 01:51:57,333
- What do you think?
- Can't we have both?

1100
01:51:57,458 --> 01:51:59,502
Why not?

1101
01:51:59,627 --> 01:52:01,712
- Dimitri.
- Sir.

1102
01:52:01,837 --> 01:52:07,093
- Lobster and cracked crab for everyone.
- Extra prima good, Mr Coleman, sir.

1103
01:52:16,268 --> 01:52:18,854
Looking good, Billy Ray.

1104
01:52:18,979 --> 01:52:21,482
Feeling good, Louis.
