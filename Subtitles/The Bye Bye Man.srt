coming over to the house.

Elliot, you can go ahead

00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:19,089
and live a sheltered, shallow,
physical existence.

286
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,806
Well, a non-physical existence
would be kind of tough.

I should believe, 'cause it means

you got rid of the spirit.

in this stuff, okay?

Right. Sorry. No being rational.

Yo, El, just loosen up
the grip a little bit,

They did.

310
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:43,329
Bro, I didn't say anything. Swear.

311
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,686
I would never tell anyone that.

312
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,845
They're worried about you, though.

313

All right, I'm sorry I laughed at you
before, but that's not funny.

00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:56,006
I'm not being funny, Elliot.
This is just what I'm getting.

315
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,325
Okay, how did they die?

316
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,966

in his power to protect you now.

But they worry that
he's taking on too much.

All right. So, you talked
to my brother tonight.

biscuits or rolls or something.

bakes biscuits.

Likewise, if I were to brush
a few atoms from this wall,

591

it would still be here.

to slowly brush the atoms,
one by one, away from this wall?

Well, at first,
you'd say it's still a wall.

I brush a few more,
well, it's still a wall.

But what if I remove every single atom
from this wall except for one?

01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:42,846
Poked around like a good nosy
reporter and heard rumors...

982
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:45,486
Whispers about an evil,

983
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:49,167
some kind of a reaper
that drove the teenager mad.

984
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:52,811
Larry had to go nosing around
and writing it down.

985
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:55,891
And then it came to Larry, too,

986
01:12:55,960 --> 01:13:00,727
this nightmare, this name
we must not think or say.

987
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:06,165
But just three days
after Larry got back from Iowa,

988
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:08,083
I came home from work.

989
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:11,243
October 20th, 1969.

990
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:14,847
The day my life went turn-turn-turn...

991
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:18,449
LARRY: Don't say it. Don't think it.

992
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:21,285
Don't say it.
Don't think it. Don't say it.

993
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:24,924
Don't think it.
Don't say it. Don't think it.

994
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,129
Don't say it. Don't think it.
Don't say it. Don't think it.

995
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:29,929
Don't say it. Don't think it.

996
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:34,885
Oh, my God.

997
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:37,326
Don't say it.

998
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:42,969
Larry... Oh, my God.

999
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:49,121
(YOUNG MS. REDMON GASPS)

1000
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:50,600
I was just doing my job.

1001
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,082
That's what I do. I track down the story.

1002
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:54,969
And that's what I was doing.

1003
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:57,801
See...

1004
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:02,846
Once you know his name,
you can't escape him.

1005
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:07,491
You see, he gets in your head and...

1006
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:10,561
He makes you do horrible things.

1007
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:12,210
Okay. Okay. (SHUSHING)

1008
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:15,362
What horrible things?

1009
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:17,647
Who makes you do this?
What are you talking about?

1010
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:19,051
Let's get you to bed, okay, sweetheart?

1011
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:23,808
Listen. Listen, I didn't know
if he was alive or dead.

1012
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:25,525
And then the hound...

1013
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:27,011
That's how you know he's coming.

1014
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:29,367
When you see the hound
and you hear the coins,

1015
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:31,204
that's when you know he's close by.

1016
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:34,248
- You understand?
- No, I... (STAMMERS)

1017
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:35,801
MS. REDMON: Larry...

1018
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:38,042
I don't know what's happened,
but I'm trying...

1019
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:39,605
He listens for his name.

1020
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:41,842
Anyone could say it. It could be you.

1021
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:43,081
Or it could be me.

1022
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:47,121
And it's just dumb luck
like the flip of a coin.

1023
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:52,242
And I heard the name
and I told Janey the name.

1024
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:54,366
"Don't think it. Don't say it."

1025
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:56,966
What does this mean? What did you write?

1026
01:14:57,040 --> 01:14:58,530
I don't understand.

1027
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:01,162
He makes you see things.

1028
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:03,643
And he makes you do things.

1029
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:08,202
Who knows how many good people
he's made do horrible things like this.

1030
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:10,601
No! Oh, God, no! Please.

1031
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:11,966
Please, don't.

1032
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:13,769
Please put it down.

1033
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:17,642
You think it's me?

1034
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:19,529
You think I did this?

1035
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:22,965
This is what happens.

1036
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:26,004
They say people snap.
They say people go crazy.

1037
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:27,411
No, it's him.

1038
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:29,086
It's him that's doing it!

1039
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:32,485
(SHUSHING) Just put it...
Put it down. Okay?

1040
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:33,641
No.

1041
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:35,841
I love you.

1042
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:38,571
MS. REDMON:
But in the end, Larry was a hero.

1043
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:40,210
You tell people that.

1044
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:42,203
Larry erased him, you see.

1045
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:45,921
He did away with everyone who'd
heard it before they could pass it on.

1046
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,411
But not you.

1047
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:48,846
You're here.

1048
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:51,728
How did you survive all this time?

1049
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:53,086
- Survive?
- Yes.

1050
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:54,721
How did you beat it?

1051
01:15:55,640 --> 01:15:57,005
I didn't beat it.

1052
01:15:57,080 --> 01:15:58,445
I never knew it.

1053
01:15:58,520 --> 01:15:59,681
What?

1054
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:02,651
If my husband had told me the name,
he'd have had to kill me with the rest.

1055
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:04,370
My husband controlled himself.

1056
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:08,411
Your fucking husband wrote the name
in the nightstand you sold and I read it.

1057
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:11,211
He typed it in a dead article
and I read that, too!

1058
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:12,247
Don't you say it!

1059
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:14,322
Your husband spared you and he got me.

1060
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:16,164
He's in me now. He's in my friends.

1061
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:19,809
- You want my help?
- Yes.

1062
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:22,081
Here.

1063
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:26,563
Kill all of the ones you told first
and then kill yourself.

1064
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:27,926
It's the only way.

1065
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:39,086
No! There has to be another way.

1066
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:41,811
"Don't say it.
Don't think it." It's a clue.

1067
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:44,045
- Look.
- (TRAIN HORN BLARING)

1068
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:46,289
Oh, my God. He's coming!

1069
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:48,806
What are you talking about?
You didn't bring him here.

1070
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:50,484
- Don't you see it?
- See what?

1071
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:54,167
The light... Hear the name...
He's in your head.

1072
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:58,961
He makes us see things, hear things,
tricks to make us afraid.

1073
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:01,281
He makes us afraid. Then he grows.

1074
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:03,601
The more scared we are,
the more real he gets.

1075
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:05,290
We make him real with our fear.

1076
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:07,408
We make him more powerful.

1077
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:11,124
Yeah, we give him the power

1078
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:13,328
and he gets closer and he hears us
when we think of him.

1079
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:15,886
But maybe, if we're not afraid,
we take his power.

1080
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:18,247
Maybe, if we're not afraid, he's nothing!

1081
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:27,201
How could you figure it out
and my Larry not?
