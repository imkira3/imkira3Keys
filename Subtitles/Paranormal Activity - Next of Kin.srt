3
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,328
Can you see it?

4
00:00:35,412 --> 00:00:37,914
Uh, yeah, a little,
but it looks good.

5
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:41,459
- All right, can you slate for me?
- Mm-hmm.

6
00:00:42,836 --> 00:00:44,754
All right, whenever you're ready.

7
00:00:44,838 --> 00:00:46,881
Mmm, okay.

8
00:00:47,465 --> 00:00:52,637
Uh, we are here in the beautiful Denny's
in Scottsdale, Arizona,

9
00:00:52,721 --> 00:00:57,726
and I am about to meet my first
biological relative, Samuel.

10
00:00:57,809 --> 00:00:59,394
- Samuel.
- Samuel.

11
00:00:59,477 --> 00:01:02,772
You gonna tell them about
all the drunken nights here at this booth?

12
00:01:02,856 --> 00:01:04,733
You do not-- You keep your mouth shut.

13
00:01:04,816 --> 00:01:06,484
Grand Slam.

14
00:01:06,568 --> 00:01:07,736
I think that's him.

15
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,072
- You think-- You think that's him?
- Mm-hmm.

16
00:01:13,742 --> 00:01:17,203
Yeah, he's trying to pay the Uber
with cash. That's definitely him.

17
00:01:23,418 --> 00:01:25,420
- Samuel?
- Yeah, that's, uh-- that's me.

18
00:01:25,503 --> 00:01:26,629
Margot.

19
00:01:26,713 --> 00:01:28,882
Cool.

20
00:01:28,965 --> 00:01:30,091
- Wow.
- Wow.

21
00:01:30,175 --> 00:01:34,262
- Oh, this is crazy. Sorry.
- No, no, I'm, uh...

22
00:01:35,346 --> 00:01:37,390
uh, at a loss for words myself.

23
00:01:38,641 --> 00:01:41,186
- Are you hungry?
- Yeah, yeah. Uh...

24
00:01:42,562 --> 00:01:43,563
Is that...

25
00:01:43,646 --> 00:01:46,399
- Yeah, it's Chris.
- Hey. How you doing?

26
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:50,862
So, uh, you said that
this is gonna be a documentary?

27
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:55,617
Yeah. It's weird. I never thought
I would ever do anything about myself.

28
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,411
Feels kind of self-indulgent,

29
00:01:58,495 --> 00:02:00,246
- but, uh...
- Mmm.

30
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,790
...Chris pushed me to do it.

31
00:02:01,873 --> 00:02:03,291
Her story's too good.

32
00:02:03,792 --> 00:02:06,085
- Some waters for you.
- Oh, thank you.

33
00:02:08,546 --> 00:02:09,714
Thank you.

34
00:02:11,758 --> 00:02:14,219
I've actually, uh, never, uh, been...

35
00:02:15,595 --> 00:02:18,223
in front of a camera before.

36
00:02:19,808 --> 00:02:21,184
Any camera?

37
00:02:21,267 --> 00:02:23,436
- Yeah.
- What?

38
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,191
Yeah, we're typically not
supposed to be, um, photographed,

39
00:02:28,274 --> 00:02:31,110
'cause, you know, uh, vanity is a sin.

40
00:02:31,194 --> 00:02:32,529
Ah. Right, right.

41
00:02:32,612 --> 00:02:36,115
But there are exceptions, if--
If our elders condone it.

42
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:39,118
Yeah, you had said on the phone
that you left the community.

43
00:02:39,202 --> 00:02:40,203
- Right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

44
00:02:40,286 --> 00:02:42,455
And how long ago has it been?

45
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:44,749
About...

46
00:02:46,751 --> 00:02:48,253
seven months, I think.

47
00:02:49,087 --> 00:02:51,297
Is this weird for your adopted parents?

48
00:02:51,381 --> 00:02:55,176
It is, but could I have gone on
living the rest of my life

49
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,637
not finding out who my real family was?

50
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,180
Yeah, it'd be fine,

51
00:03:00,557 --> 00:03:03,893
but I think for a lot of us,

52
00:03:03,977 --> 00:03:06,354
people who have been given up
by their parents,

53
00:03:07,063 --> 00:03:08,606
there's always something missing.

54
00:03:10,191 --> 00:03:16,114
Anyway, to find out where I come from
would be really special for me.

55
00:03:16,197 --> 00:03:17,407
Absolutely.

56
00:03:17,907 --> 00:03:19,325
Hopefully I can help.

57
00:03:20,702 --> 00:03:23,329
How do you even meet
an Amish dude on 23andMe?

58
00:03:23,413 --> 00:03:26,165
- Like, isn't that against the rules?
- He's on his <i>Rumspringa.</i>

59
00:03:26,249 --> 00:03:28,209
- What's that?
- It's basically like a year

60
00:03:28,293 --> 00:03:30,712
where they get to see the outside world
for themselves.

61
00:03:30,795 --> 00:03:33,798
So he was floating around, you know,
taking odd jobs.

62
00:03:33,882 --> 00:03:37,260
Then he meets this woman
and, uh, builds her a pen--

63
00:03:37,343 --> 00:03:38,428
Chicken coop.

64
00:03:38,511 --> 00:03:40,305
Thank you. Chicken coop. Correct.

65
00:03:40,388 --> 00:03:43,766
- Basically, she becomes obsessed with him.
- More of a cat-lady type, yeah.

66
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,768
Do you wanna tell the story?

67
00:03:45,852 --> 00:03:48,646
- My bad, my bad. I'm sorry.
- 'Cause you can if you want.

68
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:55,445
Anyway, so basically she's bragging to him
about how she's 25% Cherokee or whatever

69
00:03:55,528 --> 00:03:57,989
and tells him about
the online DNA test you can do.

70
00:03:58,072 --> 00:04:01,826
So he gets one, gets a match-- it's me.

71
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,995
She's Amish.

72
00:04:04,078 --> 00:04:06,205
- I am not Amish.
- You are Amish.

73
00:04:06,289 --> 00:04:07,290
Not how that works.

74
00:04:09,918 --> 00:04:11,794
You got this from the hospital?

75
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:16,966
I can't believe anyone
would just abandon their baby like that.

76
00:04:18,927 --> 00:04:24,307
Yeah, I've probably
watched that video over a hundred times,

77
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,768
and I get a new question
every time I watch it.

78
00:04:27,769 --> 00:04:29,395
Like, why did she do it?

79
00:04:30,313 --> 00:04:33,650
Why did she drive so far away
just to abandon me?

80
00:04:36,527 --> 00:04:39,072
Is she even still alive? You know.

81
00:04:41,616 --> 00:04:45,036
And what I think is weird about it
is the way that she's holding me.

82
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:48,373
Like, looking around like she's scared.

83
00:04:49,707 --> 00:04:52,710
Maybe she was just worried
she was gonna get caught.

84
00:04:53,628 --> 00:04:54,879
Guilt, yeah?

85
00:04:54,963 --> 00:04:57,048
Yeah, I mean, that's what I think.

86
00:04:57,131 --> 00:04:58,174
Maybe.

87
00:04:58,841 --> 00:04:59,926
I don't know.

88
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:13,523
<i>Attention,
all passengers in the baggage claim area.</i>

89
00:05:13,606 --> 00:05:16,109
<i>Delta would like to welcome you
to Buffalo, New York.</i>

90
00:05:20,989 --> 00:05:22,782
- My signature shot.
- Spaz.

91
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:25,201
Oh, here, I got it.

92
00:05:25,284 --> 00:05:26,703
Damn. Kid is strong.

93
00:05:26,786 --> 00:05:29,872
Oh, you know, farm labor.
You get used to moving heavy stuff.

94
00:05:30,373 --> 00:05:33,334
- Thanks.
- What is this stuff?

95
00:05:33,418 --> 00:05:34,585
Magic, baby.

96
00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:37,005
Lipstick cam, drone, LEDs.

97
00:05:37,088 --> 00:05:40,800
- We're not fucking around over here.
- Yeah, clearly not. Okay.

98
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:44,971
Uh, our sound guy said
he'd be in a green van.

99
00:05:45,054 --> 00:05:46,055
Oh. Right there.

100
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:47,223
Hey.

101
00:05:47,306 --> 00:05:48,433
Yes.

102
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:57,066
- Hey.
- Hey-- Oh.

103
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:59,360
Airport. Sorry, mask. I got it. Sick.

104
00:06:04,073 --> 00:06:05,158
- Hey.
- Are you Dale?

105
00:06:05,241 --> 00:06:06,284
- Yeah.
- Hey, I'm Margot.

106
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:08,786
- This is Chris, our DP.
- Hey.

107
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,371
- This is Sam.
- Hey. Dale, Sam.

108
00:06:10,455 --> 00:06:14,250
- Thank you so much for picking up the van.
- Of course. Let's get you guys loaded up.

109
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:16,627
It was his first flight ever, actually.

110
00:06:16,711 --> 00:06:17,962
- First flight ever?
- Yeah.

111
00:06:18,046 --> 00:06:19,130
- Yeah.
- No shit!

112
00:06:20,006 --> 00:06:21,382
That's a great camera.

113
00:06:26,763 --> 00:06:29,140
- Make yourselves comfortable.
- Yeah, thank you.

114
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:31,350
Oh, we all got tested. Are you okay if we...

115
00:06:31,434 --> 00:06:32,602
Oh, yeah, yeah.

116
00:06:32,685 --> 00:06:34,437
I got COVID, like, five times.

117
00:06:35,146 --> 00:06:36,689
All good, baby.

118
00:06:36,773 --> 00:06:37,857
Really?

119
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:41,569
Yeah. I mean, it was diagnosed once,
but I think I kept getting it after that.

120
00:06:41,652 --> 00:06:44,697
Yeah, I don't know.
My body is weird, but I'm alive.

121
00:06:44,781 --> 00:06:47,075
Seriously, thank you so much
for getting us though.

122
00:06:47,158 --> 00:06:49,786
Yeah, of course. I had nothing going on,
so this is great for me.

123
00:06:50,495 --> 00:06:52,622
There's so much more snow up here.

124
00:06:52,705 --> 00:06:54,957
Oh, yeah. Weather changes every day.

125
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:57,460
One day you got snow, next it's slush.

126
00:06:57,543 --> 00:06:59,587
That's why you gotta do, like,
these zip off--

127
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,672
I do all my pants with zip offs, so it's--

128
00:07:01,756 --> 00:07:04,217
You got pants. Oh, it's too hot out?

129
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,760
Now you got shorts, baby.

130
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:09,222
I'll show you when we get in.
I'll throw the legs on, dude. It rules.

131
00:07:09,305 --> 00:07:10,348
It's--

132
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:13,851
And I gotta say, easy access
for the ladies, if you know what I mean.

133
00:07:13,935 --> 00:07:14,936
Okay.

134
00:07:15,019 --> 00:07:16,604
Hey, look at that.

135
00:07:17,814 --> 00:07:18,815
What?

136
00:07:30,493 --> 00:07:32,453
What's going through your head?

137
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:36,124
I'm nervous, but excited.

138
00:07:41,003 --> 00:07:43,756
<i>? Or are we looking
for an answer? ?</i>

139
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:57,979
Okay, so just, uh--
Just past the barn here.

140
00:07:58,062 --> 00:07:59,063
The turnoff here.

141
00:07:59,147 --> 00:08:00,940
You have any service here?

142
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,400
Uh, nope.

143
00:08:02,483 --> 00:08:04,694
Yeah, me either.

144
00:08:04,777 --> 00:08:05,862
Christ.

145
00:08:06,362 --> 00:08:07,697
Slow, slow, slow.

146
00:08:08,739 --> 00:08:11,367
Okay, and you can stop here.

147
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,204
- Okay.
- Oh, wow, it's so cute.

148
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:18,082
Oh, um--

149
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:20,626
You guys, actually,
just, uh, give me a second here.

150
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:22,795
Uh, I'll be back in one second.

151
00:08:53,242 --> 00:08:54,285
Samuel!

152
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:56,245
Eli, go back in the house.

153
00:08:57,955 --> 00:08:59,081
Oh, God.

154
00:09:02,752 --> 00:09:04,420
That doesn't look great.

155
00:09:09,634 --> 00:09:10,760
Okay.

156
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:20,478
All right, guys, uh...

157
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:23,064
bad news.

158
00:09:27,902 --> 00:09:31,697
So you didn't think to call ahead
and let them know we were coming?

159
00:09:32,448 --> 00:09:35,785
They're fucking Amish, dude.
They don't have a phone.

160
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:37,036
Oh.

161
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:38,663
- Right.
- Yeah.

162
00:09:40,456 --> 00:09:42,416
Two beds.

163
00:09:43,793 --> 00:09:46,420
Okay, we're gonna have to figure that out.

164
00:09:47,213 --> 00:09:48,381
Goddamn.

165
00:09:48,464 --> 00:09:51,008
You gotta teach me how you do this.
Do you have a system?

166
00:09:51,092 --> 00:09:53,678
Yeah, you know, you just make a list,
account for it,

167
00:09:53,761 --> 00:09:55,513
make sure you put it in the right spot.

168
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:58,391
That blue one actually goes right there
in that corner.

169
00:09:58,474 --> 00:09:59,517
- There you go.
- Awesome.

170
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,019
Yeah, it's-- you know, it's pretty easy.

171
00:10:02,103 --> 00:10:04,313
Man! GoPro.

172
00:10:04,397 --> 00:10:07,024
These rule. Love these.
You can get them filthy,

173
00:10:07,108 --> 00:10:09,360
you can toss them around,
you can get them wet.

174
00:10:10,278 --> 00:10:13,281
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you can do...

175
00:10:13,364 --> 00:10:15,324
- Yeah, you can do a lot with the GoPros.
- Yeah.

176
00:10:15,408 --> 00:10:16,492
Yeah, you're right.

177
00:10:22,665 --> 00:10:23,666
You missed it.

178
00:10:23,749 --> 00:10:28,629
I mean, like, maybe this is, uh,
gonna be a process. You know?

179
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,592
Maybe Sam can go back tomorrow
and try again.

180
00:10:34,302 --> 00:10:36,137
I mean, he-- he left 'em.

181
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,264
- They probably don't even want him back.
- Shh.

182
00:10:38,347 --> 00:10:39,682
- Stop.
- I'm just saying.

183
00:10:39,765 --> 00:10:42,518
- Keep your voice down.
- We might have to adopt him.

184
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:44,478
He's right there. Can you chill?

185
00:10:49,734 --> 00:10:50,943
We'll figure it out.

186
00:10:58,409 --> 00:11:00,911
What was that?

187
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:13,841
- Mm-mmm.
- Oh. Oh.

188
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:15,426
Gentlemen first, okay?

189
00:11:19,305 --> 00:11:21,974
- Did-- Did you leave that open?
- No.

190
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:36,530
You're such a scaredy-cat.

191
00:11:36,614 --> 00:11:37,823
It's adorable.

192
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:40,951
Oh, gosh.

193
00:11:41,035 --> 00:11:42,578
Shit!

194
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:48,542
Eli, what are you doing here?

195
00:12:00,888 --> 00:12:03,182
Oh. Here, I got it.

196
00:12:08,813 --> 00:12:11,899
- Uh, may-- may I?
- Oh, no, it's okay. Thank you.

197
00:12:15,152 --> 00:12:16,320
Oh, hi, puppy.

198
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:20,741
Sorry.

199
00:12:20,825 --> 00:12:21,909
This way.

200
00:12:28,707 --> 00:12:30,960
All right, I'm this way.

201
00:12:31,043 --> 00:12:33,337
- So you guys sleep tight.
- Oh, yeah.

202
00:12:33,421 --> 00:12:35,631
I'll be, uh, in there.

203
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:37,299
- See you in the morning.
- Good night.

204
00:12:37,842 --> 00:12:39,677
Your room is over here.

205
00:12:46,392 --> 00:12:47,435
Wow.

206
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:50,229
Oh, it's beautiful.

207
00:12:50,312 --> 00:12:52,565
There's more wood by the stove.

208
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:54,567
- If you need anything, let me know.
- Okay.

209
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:56,819
- Good night.
- It's perfect. Thank you so much.

210
00:12:59,155 --> 00:13:01,198
Hey, Jacob, actually, um...

211
00:13:02,408 --> 00:13:05,453
- Thank you. That means so much.
- Good night.

212
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:14,253
Okay. So, what-- what'd he say?

213
00:13:15,671 --> 00:13:19,467
He said, "Thank you so much
for bringing Eli home,"

214
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:23,596
and he's really grateful,
so we can stay for a couple of days.

215
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:25,890
- With our cameras?
- He said, "Okay."

216
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:27,975
Hey! Yes!

217
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:30,853
It's so weird, like, I was so...

218
00:13:31,479 --> 00:13:36,358
I mean, it was the first people
I've ever seen who are related to me.

219
00:13:36,442 --> 00:13:40,237
- Yeah, that's your family.
- I was wondering if we'd look alike.

220
00:13:40,321 --> 00:13:43,449
Dale, you don't fit on the bed.

221
00:13:43,532 --> 00:13:45,367
Oh, yeah.

222
00:13:45,451 --> 00:13:48,078
I'm used to it. I sleep on a full at home.

223
00:13:48,162 --> 00:13:51,248
Why do you sleep on a full?
You're, like, 6'7".

224
00:13:51,332 --> 00:13:53,959
I-- I share a room with my mom,
and she-- she takes the queen.

225
00:13:54,043 --> 00:13:56,378
- You sleep with your mom?
- Yeah, yeah.

226
00:13:56,462 --> 00:13:58,005
She lives with me, so...

227
00:13:58,088 --> 00:13:59,298
I don't-- Yeah.

228
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:02,426
- What?
- That's sweet.

229
00:14:06,013 --> 00:14:07,264
Chris?

230
00:14:08,307 --> 00:14:09,308
- Chris?
- What?

231
00:14:09,391 --> 00:14:10,392
Look.

232
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:14,730
What's up?

233
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:25,574
What the hell?
It's, like, 2:00 in the morning.

234
00:14:26,367 --> 00:14:27,826
Are those people?

235
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:35,417
Yeah, I hope so.

236
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:36,919
I mean, what else could it be?

237
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:39,880
It's like they're
going into the forest.

238
00:14:47,471 --> 00:14:49,014
What the fuck?

239
00:14:53,978 --> 00:14:55,479
That was weird.

240
00:15:11,203 --> 00:15:13,247
I got some cool B-roll
this morning.

241
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:16,917
Froot Loops.

242
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:20,045
Did you know
that they could eat Froot Loops?

243
00:15:20,129 --> 00:15:22,798
It's cereal, dude, not a computer.

244
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:25,092
- Hey.
- You don't have to do this.

245
00:15:25,593 --> 00:15:28,554
I love your dress. It's so pretty.
Did you make that?

246
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:31,599
No. It's from Walmart.

247
00:15:31,682 --> 00:15:32,975
Do you have TikTok?

248
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:37,021
- Uh, no, not on my phone.
- I do. I gotta show you this video I made.

249
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:39,648
Mary, stop rushing around.

250
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,946
Sorry, Levina. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

251
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,156
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

252
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:51,035
Sorry. Just trying to give you
some local flair.

253
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:52,328
It means, "How are you?"

254
00:15:53,037 --> 00:15:54,663
- Hi!
- Hi, Eli.

255
00:15:54,747 --> 00:15:55,914
What's up, dude?

256
00:15:56,749 --> 00:15:59,209
Um-- Hey, Eli. Eli.

257
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:04,840
So do you all have any plans
for the day, or...

258
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:09,803
Um, we would love to see,
you know, the rest of your home.

259
00:16:09,887 --> 00:16:11,305
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

260
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:15,184
I know the elders like Jacob
can feel kind of intense,

261
00:16:15,267 --> 00:16:17,311
but as long as you stick with me,
you'll be fine.

262
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:19,897
Don't approach anybody in the community
without asking their permission.

263
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:23,400
Everybody's really nice,
but, uh, they can be a little shy.

264
00:16:23,484 --> 00:16:26,403
Um-- Oh, the woods, I would avoid those.

265
00:16:26,487 --> 00:16:27,738
Um, we get bears.

266
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:31,408
And I'll be with you, but, uh, they get
kind of violent during the winter.

267
00:16:31,492 --> 00:16:33,160
Actually, we saw some people

268
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:35,204
going into the woods last night,
super late.

269
00:16:35,287 --> 00:16:37,748
Yeah, that was
probably a hunting party. Um--

270
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:40,793
Somebody's cow got attacked, so...

271
00:16:40,876 --> 00:16:42,753
- Oh. Okay.
- Yeah.

272
00:16:45,506 --> 00:16:47,633
I feel like everyone
seems relatively young.

273
00:16:49,218 --> 00:16:51,595
So how long has the family been here?

274
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:55,265
A long time. About 200 years, I think.

275
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:58,143
- 200 years?
- Yeah.

276
00:16:58,227 --> 00:17:00,104
Watch the fire here.

277
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:02,147
So this is the workshop.

278
00:17:02,231 --> 00:17:06,443
- Fix horseshoes, equipment, wheels.
- Wow.

279
00:17:07,695 --> 00:17:08,987
Work 'em young.

280
00:17:09,071 --> 00:17:10,864
Yeah, everyone has a purpose.

281
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:13,450
He's not used to strangers. Come on.

282
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:18,580
Where did my mom live when she was here?

283
00:17:18,664 --> 00:17:21,834
I think she was in the room above yours,
but we just use it as storage now.

284
00:17:21,917 --> 00:17:23,168
Oh.

285
00:17:23,252 --> 00:17:25,713
- You wanna see the barn?
- Yeah.

286
00:17:25,796 --> 00:17:27,756
Oh, my gosh,

287
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,633
there's so many cows.

288
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:34,555
- What's all the bags?
- Uh, it's salt.

289
00:17:34,638 --> 00:17:36,557
You know, for the animals and ice.

290
00:17:38,183 --> 00:17:40,686
- Are those pigs? Stop.
- Also got some pigs.

291
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:43,063
Come on.

292
00:17:43,647 --> 00:17:45,232
- There's pigs.
- Okay, come on over.

293
00:17:45,816 --> 00:17:46,942
Guys, get in.

294
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:48,986
- They really like...
- Dale, get in.

295
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:50,696
No, you don't have to get the shot.

296
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:53,157
Just, like, you have to
experience the pigs, okay?

297
00:17:53,741 --> 00:17:56,076
You could put your boom mic-- Yeah.

298
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,203
Yeah, get-get his-- get his dialogue.

299
00:17:58,287 --> 00:18:00,080
- Stop.
- Hey, what's the scoop?

300
00:18:00,164 --> 00:18:03,625
- Sir, what's the scoop?
- I gotta get a shot of these guys too.

301
00:18:03,709 --> 00:18:05,377
- It's too cute.
- Do they all have, like--

302
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:08,630
How do I say this?
Like, nice butts like that?

303
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,552
- Hey, you guys wanna see the loft?
- Yes.

304
00:18:15,387 --> 00:18:18,682
- Oh, hey.
- Oh, my God, Sam.

305
00:18:18,766 --> 00:18:20,976
- It's pretty cool, right?
- It's huge.

306
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:23,979
Well, we got a lot of animals to feed,
especially during the winter.

307
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:26,356
- It's beautiful.
- You're gonna do my job too?

308
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,734
- You're in the center of my frame.
- That's what we're doing?

309
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:32,446
- Shit, man.
- Okay.

310
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:33,697
Sorry. You okay?

311
00:18:34,323 --> 00:18:36,074
- Yeah.
- I'm so sorry. There's a bale drop there.

312
00:18:36,158 --> 00:18:38,702
- You gotta be careful.
- That wouldn't have been too good.

313
00:18:38,786 --> 00:18:40,078
Shish kebab, you know?

314
00:18:40,162 --> 00:18:42,247
- I wasn't paying any attention.
- No, it's okay.

315
00:18:42,331 --> 00:18:44,249
There's just lots of holes around here.

316
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,710
- Let's get you away from that.
- I'm a klutz. Thank you.

317
00:18:46,794 --> 00:18:48,587
- You good?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

318
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,798
- Let's get down from this height.
- Is there a restroom?

319
00:18:50,881 --> 00:18:52,883
I kind of peed a little when she...

320
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:03,018
- Hey. Hi.
- Hi.

321
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:04,144
I'm Margot.

322
00:19:04,228 --> 00:19:07,064
I don't think I've met you guys yet,
but, yeah, we've met.

323
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:08,649
- That's Clara.
- Clara, hi.

324
00:19:08,732 --> 00:19:10,692
- And Grace.
- A dog!

325
00:19:10,776 --> 00:19:12,110
He's so cute.

326
00:19:12,194 --> 00:19:13,195
How old are you guys?

327
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:14,988
- I'm 16.
- Sixteen?

328
00:19:15,864 --> 00:19:17,366
Are you-- You're all 16?

329
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:20,577
Yeah, so you guys are way too young
to have known my mom.

330
00:19:21,203 --> 00:19:24,081
But your parents,
do they ever talk about her?

331
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:27,334
My mom said Sarah hooked up
with an Englishman.

332
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:29,378
- Clara.
- Everyone knows it.

333
00:19:30,254 --> 00:19:31,755
An Englishman?

334
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:33,757
Just means someone outside the community.

335
00:19:34,925 --> 00:19:38,303
Oh, so, like... like, a local?

336
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:43,016
Um, does anybody know who he was?

337
00:19:46,603 --> 00:19:49,773
So she got pregnant with an outsider?

338
00:19:50,482 --> 00:19:53,151
So I imagine that didn't
go over very well.

339
00:19:53,235 --> 00:19:55,028
We have a lot of work to do.

340
00:19:55,529 --> 00:19:58,657
We'll get in trouble if we
don't get to it. Right, Clara?

341
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:01,034
- Yes, I'm sorry.
- Excuse us.

342
00:20:32,357 --> 00:20:33,984
- Amen.
- Amen.

343
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:39,615
We have a saying.

344
00:20:40,198 --> 00:20:44,244
"The storm may scatter a thousand leaves,
but the tree grows anew."

345
00:20:44,995 --> 00:20:47,205
We are humbled and grateful

346
00:20:47,289 --> 00:20:49,499
to have our sister, Margot,
returned to us.

347
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:51,877
The Lord's will unfolds,

348
00:20:52,461 --> 00:20:56,924
and we accept the obligations
and the sacrifices that he expects of us.

349
00:20:59,134 --> 00:21:00,177
Eh.

350
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:03,889
Uh, thank you so much
for allowing us into your home.

351
00:21:03,972 --> 00:21:05,599
I am so grateful.

352
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:08,268
Seriously. Um...

353
00:21:08,352 --> 00:21:11,063
I've always hoped
that I could meet you all,

354
00:21:11,146 --> 00:21:14,399
so this is a really special moment for me.

355
00:21:14,483 --> 00:21:16,526
So thank you.

356
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:20,030
Dude. Dude.

357
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:22,115
I thought it was a clap moment.

358
00:21:24,576 --> 00:21:25,661
Begin.

359
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:29,331
I'd have some, but...

360
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:35,337
Oh, right. Right, right, right.

361
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,131
They-- They tend to the chickens.

362
00:21:38,215 --> 00:21:40,384
- Hamburger.
- Hamburger.

363
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:40,694
Jacob definitely
has a thing for you.

364
00:22:40,777 --> 00:22:42,237
- What?
- He's always staring at you.

365
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,321
Don't be gross.

366
00:22:43,405 --> 00:22:45,699
What's wrong with this thing?
Nothing's charging.

367
00:22:45,782 --> 00:22:48,160
- It's old. Just wiggle it.
- That's what she said.

368
00:22:48,243 --> 00:22:50,328
Stupid.

369
00:22:50,412 --> 00:22:55,042
I actually thought it was really sweet
the way everyone was so present.

370
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:57,169
What, you wanna join 'em?

371
00:22:57,252 --> 00:22:59,629
No, but I mean, like,
when is the last time

372
00:22:59,713 --> 00:23:02,215
that you went to dinner
and didn't look at your phone?

373
00:23:02,966 --> 00:23:05,135
Tonight.

374
00:23:06,011 --> 00:23:07,054
Exactly.

375
00:23:11,308 --> 00:23:13,643
Dude, close it. It's freezing.

376
00:23:13,727 --> 00:23:15,979
I don't hear the genny.

377
00:23:16,897 --> 00:23:18,732
And it's snowing again.

378
00:23:20,609 --> 00:23:23,236
I'd fix it, but I'm already in my cammies.

379
00:23:27,199 --> 00:23:28,617
It's dark dark.

380
00:23:31,745 --> 00:23:32,788
"Cammies."

381
00:23:33,705 --> 00:23:35,040
It's coming down.

382
00:23:57,229 --> 00:23:58,271
Shit.

383
00:24:04,903 --> 00:24:06,238
Oh, shit!

384
00:24:08,615 --> 00:24:10,617
Bitch-ass scarecrow.

385
00:24:13,703 --> 00:24:15,372
Ain't even no crows out here.

386
00:24:24,548 --> 00:24:25,715
Fuck.

387
00:24:37,352 --> 00:24:39,437
Come on, baby, don't do this to me now.

388
00:25:03,003 --> 00:25:04,254
Oh, Jesus.

389
00:25:06,339 --> 00:25:07,757
Kid, you scared me.

390
00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:09,801
Where are your shoes?

391
00:25:12,596 --> 00:25:13,805
Sleepwalker.

392
00:25:14,848 --> 00:25:16,558
He does it from time to time.

393
00:25:17,809 --> 00:25:19,186
Lucky you were out here.

394
00:25:19,269 --> 00:25:20,687
Yeah. Our generator died.

395
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:23,732
Come back inside. The cold will bite you.

396
00:25:26,026 --> 00:25:27,027
Weird.

397
00:25:31,489 --> 00:25:33,116
My head is killing me.

398
00:25:34,534 --> 00:25:37,829
- What's up with that?
- Barometric pressure.

399
00:25:37,913 --> 00:25:39,748
It's like altitude sickness,

400
00:25:39,831 --> 00:25:42,375
only your body's reacting
to the clean air.

401
00:25:42,459 --> 00:25:45,921
Dale, you are an encyclopedia
of random information.

402
00:25:46,004 --> 00:25:47,005
Thank you.

403
00:25:49,925 --> 00:25:53,678
Did you hear that sound again last night,
like someone walking in the attic?

404
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:56,598
- No, I was knocked out.
- Same.

405
00:26:06,942 --> 00:26:08,860
Dale, you're completely insane.

406
00:26:08,944 --> 00:26:12,155
Come on. The makeover maketh the man.

407
00:26:12,239 --> 00:26:14,032
- That's what she said, right?
- Yeah.

408
00:26:14,115 --> 00:26:16,201
Yeah.

409
00:26:22,832 --> 00:26:25,210
Yes, Dale!

410
00:26:25,293 --> 00:26:28,421
Hee-hee! Oh? Oh?

411
00:26:28,505 --> 00:26:29,756
Yeah, what do we think?

412
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:32,092
You guys know that dance?
A little moonwalk.

413
00:26:32,175 --> 00:26:34,511
Yeah, do the dance. Come on, everybody!

414
00:26:34,594 --> 00:26:36,054
Everybody, dance with me.

415
00:26:36,137 --> 00:26:38,640
Hello, hello.

416
00:26:40,475 --> 00:26:41,768
Suits you.

417
00:26:48,525 --> 00:26:50,860
- Let's go talk to 'em.
- Yeah.

418
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:01,663
See, that's slow motion.
It's getting a whole bunch of frames

419
00:27:01,746 --> 00:27:02,747
for one second.

420
00:27:02,831 --> 00:27:04,874
A thousand pictures, one second.

421
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:08,503
So it gets, like, the little details,
intricacies of you.

422
00:27:08,586 --> 00:27:10,714
You know, the water
splashing up right there.

423
00:27:10,797 --> 00:27:13,258
- Stuff the human eye can't see.
- Mmm.

424
00:27:18,763 --> 00:27:20,307
I like your doll.

425
00:27:23,518 --> 00:27:24,728
What's her name?

426
00:27:24,811 --> 00:27:26,062
Sarah.

427
00:27:29,941 --> 00:27:31,943
- That's a pretty name.
- Thanks.

428
00:27:34,154 --> 00:27:36,072
You know, that was my mom's name.

429
00:27:37,073 --> 00:27:39,117
She used to live here a long time ago.

430
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,910
She's still here.

431
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:44,039
What did you say?

432
00:27:44,122 --> 00:27:46,166
She doesn't like you.

433
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:49,210
Who doesn't like me?

434
00:27:50,754 --> 00:27:51,838
Wait, y--

435
00:27:54,591 --> 00:27:56,551
She just left her doll like that?

436
00:28:10,607 --> 00:28:12,025
What is that?

437
00:28:31,336 --> 00:28:35,548
It's three o'clock in the morning,
and somebody's up there again.

438
00:28:35,632 --> 00:28:37,842
Third night in a row.

439
00:28:43,181 --> 00:28:44,474
Oh, fuck.

440
00:29:03,868 --> 00:29:04,869
Okay.

441
00:29:08,123 --> 00:29:09,332
Oh, fuck.

442
00:29:44,075 --> 00:29:45,493
Creepy.

443
00:31:08,493 --> 00:31:09,911
What the fuck?

444
00:31:25,802 --> 00:31:26,803
What?

445
00:31:46,614 --> 00:31:48,449
No fucking way.

446
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:24,944
What is that?

447
00:32:55,475 --> 00:32:56,643
Hello?

448
00:33:05,568 --> 00:33:06,861
Hello?

449
00:35:01,017 --> 00:35:02,351
You gotta be kidding me.

450
00:35:02,852 --> 00:35:04,103
Fuck.

451
00:35:05,897 --> 00:35:07,565
How do I get out of here?

452
00:35:12,069 --> 00:35:13,362
Okay.

453
00:35:22,955 --> 00:35:23,998
Fuck.

454
00:35:27,543 --> 00:35:29,212
God.

455
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:39,806
This is gonna be interesting.

456
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:53,110
- What was it?
- I don't know.

457
00:35:53,611 --> 00:35:56,239
I don't--
I mean, it looks like a face, right?

458
00:35:56,322 --> 00:35:58,366
It's gotta be something else.

459
00:35:58,449 --> 00:36:01,244
I mean, a lens distortion.

460
00:36:01,327 --> 00:36:03,704
- A lens distortion?
- Mmm.

461
00:36:03,788 --> 00:36:07,667
Fucking-- See, this is-- No.

462
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:10,920
This is why I don't like creepy old farms.
They're always haunted.

463
00:36:11,003 --> 00:36:12,839
Dale, keep your voice down.

464
00:36:12,922 --> 00:36:15,883
I'm serious. Look at this place.
Tell me it's not fucking haunted.

465
00:36:15,967 --> 00:36:17,218
Really.

466
00:36:17,301 --> 00:36:19,637
My cousin Greg saw a ghost
in the walk-in freezer

467
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:20,930
at a Cracker Barrel.

468
00:36:21,597 --> 00:36:23,891
What was he going in
the walk-in freezer for?

469
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:27,311
- He worked there.
- Okay.

470
00:36:29,856 --> 00:36:32,233
Come on, are you--
Are you really buying this shit?

471
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:35,653
I mean, I felt something up there with me.

472
00:36:37,697 --> 00:36:38,823
Okay.

473
00:36:38,906 --> 00:36:42,410
So, we're ghost hunters now. Is that it?

474
00:36:42,493 --> 00:36:44,871
'Cause I thought I signed up
for a prestige documentary,

475
00:36:44,954 --> 00:36:46,914
not a fringy ghost-farm cable show.

476
00:36:46,998 --> 00:36:48,958
It's not funny, Chris. It's not.

477
00:36:49,041 --> 00:36:53,129
I mean, like, the letter,
the creepy drawing.

478
00:36:54,839 --> 00:36:57,341
And then the little girl saying,
"She's still here."

479
00:36:57,884 --> 00:36:59,886
I mean, something is going on,

480
00:37:00,678 --> 00:37:03,890
and it feels like it has something to do
with my mom.

481
00:37:05,349 --> 00:37:07,310
Yeah, right over there.
That'd be great.

482
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:09,729
You're set. Sorry, just making sure that--

483
00:37:09,812 --> 00:37:11,647
It doesn't matter
if you can see it, right?

484
00:37:13,149 --> 00:37:14,358
Dale, two steps back.

485
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:16,861
Looks good.

486
00:37:17,612 --> 00:37:18,821
Do I just start?

487
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:21,365
- Yeah, when you're ready.
- Mmm.

488
00:37:25,953 --> 00:37:27,914
Sarah was, um...

489
00:37:29,957 --> 00:37:31,792
Sarah was our wildflower.

490
00:37:34,045 --> 00:37:35,546
A nonconformist

491
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:40,217
growing up in a community
whose bedrock is homogeneity.

492
00:37:40,301 --> 00:37:41,677
And, uh...

493
00:37:43,304 --> 00:37:44,680
Uh--

494
00:37:45,222 --> 00:37:46,599
But the, uh...

495
00:37:48,517 --> 00:37:49,644
I mean, what...

496
00:37:51,062 --> 00:37:55,358
What we all saw as spunky
and free-spirited

497
00:37:55,441 --> 00:37:57,610
when she was a little girl, um...

498
00:38:00,613 --> 00:38:05,076
it evolved into something much darker.

499
00:38:06,994 --> 00:38:09,330
There were several attempts
to take her own life.

500
00:38:09,413 --> 00:38:10,498
What?

501
00:38:10,581 --> 00:38:13,709
When that didn't work, she got pregnant.

502
00:38:14,377 --> 00:38:18,339
It was-- It was a boy from town.
She wouldn't tell us who.

503
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:22,802
I--

504
00:38:24,679 --> 00:38:28,015
I suspect she did it purely out of spite,

505
00:38:28,808 --> 00:38:30,142
as a way to--

506
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:33,646
To rail against our ways

507
00:38:34,146 --> 00:38:35,523
and our rules.

508
00:38:35,606 --> 00:38:38,275
And, uh, that-- that worked.

509
00:38:39,235 --> 00:38:40,486
She was shunned.

510
00:38:41,195 --> 00:38:42,196
Shunned.

511
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,117
What, like, sent away?

512
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,202
No, no.

513
00:38:48,285 --> 00:38:51,747
Shunning is being separated
from the flock.

514
00:38:53,124 --> 00:38:57,628
You eat alone, you work alone,
you sleep alone.

515
00:38:59,005 --> 00:39:02,258
And that's--
And that is painful, trust me.

516
00:39:06,846 --> 00:39:10,307
I suppose it could be
what drove her away in the end.

517
00:39:17,565 --> 00:39:20,359
I found this letter in my mom's room.

518
00:39:31,704 --> 00:39:33,706
You were in the attic last night.

519
00:39:34,707 --> 00:39:38,753
What did she mean when she said,
"You can't have me or my baby"?

520
00:39:44,341 --> 00:39:47,386
We don't allow children out of wedlock.

521
00:39:48,304 --> 00:39:52,641
Sarah was required to give her baby
to another wedded couple in the community.

522
00:39:55,478 --> 00:39:57,229
She was forced to give me away?

523
00:39:57,313 --> 00:39:58,314
That's right.

524
00:40:03,819 --> 00:40:04,904
That's horrible.

525
00:40:05,404 --> 00:40:09,158
More horrible than leaving a newborn
on the ground,

526
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:12,078
on the sidewalk like a piece of trash?

527
00:40:13,412 --> 00:40:14,914
I loved Sarah.

528
00:40:14,997 --> 00:40:18,334
She was my only daughter,
but she cared for nobody but herself.

529
00:40:20,461 --> 00:40:21,962
That was her sickness.

530
00:40:25,966 --> 00:40:27,009
I get it.

531
00:40:28,469 --> 00:40:30,054
It's shitty what they did to her.

532
00:40:31,597 --> 00:40:32,598
Yeah.

533
00:40:42,483 --> 00:40:45,820
But I mean,
she did the right thing though, right?

534
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,699
'Cause otherwise
I would have been stuck here forever.

535
00:40:52,701 --> 00:40:53,702
For sure.

536
00:41:00,918 --> 00:41:02,503
I ke--

537
00:41:03,462 --> 00:41:05,256
I keep thinking about that little girl.

538
00:41:07,633 --> 00:41:09,176
What she said the other day.

539
00:41:16,642 --> 00:41:18,185
It's just like I have this...

540
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:22,148
weird feeling she's still here,

541
00:41:22,231 --> 00:41:25,526
in the pit of my stomach,
ever since I got here.

542
00:41:27,194 --> 00:41:29,280
I can't put my finger on it.

543
00:42:18,204 --> 00:42:19,580
All right, not much further.

544
00:42:19,663 --> 00:42:22,208
The drone made it seem
like it was right over here.

545
00:42:22,291 --> 00:42:27,213
I think I would do, like,
a spaghetti with meatballs right now.

546
00:42:27,296 --> 00:42:29,048
Are you that hungry?

547
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:31,759
Would you guys eat human?

548
00:42:31,842 --> 00:42:34,011
No, I would never eat a human.

549
00:42:34,094 --> 00:42:38,224
I would eat a person, faster than
I'd like to admit, to be honest.

550
00:42:38,307 --> 00:42:40,184
Well, that's noted.

551
00:42:40,267 --> 00:42:42,353
Look up though. Look at that.

552
00:42:44,396 --> 00:42:48,317
How far away are we supposed to go?

553
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:51,320
Whoa.

554
00:42:51,946 --> 00:42:54,657
Right? That's what
I've been telling you about.

555
00:42:55,699 --> 00:42:57,743
So it's a church. Whoopee.

556
00:42:57,826 --> 00:43:01,538
Yeah, but why would they
build a church all the way back here?

557
00:43:01,622 --> 00:43:03,040
It's like a mile away.

558
00:43:03,123 --> 00:43:05,542
Gotta be
where they were going the other night.

559
00:43:05,626 --> 00:43:08,254
Bears, my ass.

560
00:43:08,337 --> 00:43:10,923
That means a lot of people
walking through here.

561
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:13,884
- Be careful.
- Watch your step.

562
00:43:13,968 --> 00:43:15,177
Yeah.

563
00:43:17,638 --> 00:43:21,767
<i>"So weit-- So weit nicht weiter."</i>

564
00:43:22,810 --> 00:43:24,270
Anyone speak German?

565
00:43:24,353 --> 00:43:25,854
Yeah, it says, um,

566
00:43:26,355 --> 00:43:28,399
"Sweet, nice wiener."

567
00:43:31,485 --> 00:43:32,486
Man.

568
00:43:36,031 --> 00:43:38,784
- Can you pick a lock?
- Of course. I'm Black.

569
00:43:41,745 --> 00:43:43,414
Move aside, please.

570
00:43:45,165 --> 00:43:46,166
No way.

571
00:43:47,042 --> 00:43:50,170
Yeah, cousin Greg
used to boost stuff all the time.

572
00:43:50,713 --> 00:43:52,798
- You know, TVs, cars, whatever.
- Sorry.

573
00:43:52,881 --> 00:43:54,174
Cousin Greg's busy.

574
00:43:54,258 --> 00:43:56,218
Cousin Greg is in prison.

575
00:43:57,052 --> 00:43:58,095
Voila.

576
00:44:00,889 --> 00:44:02,391
No, no, stop!

577
00:44:03,017 --> 00:44:06,145
This is a house of worship.
It's off limits to you. No cameras!

578
00:44:06,228 --> 00:44:07,688
I'm sorry. Yeah.

579
00:44:08,188 --> 00:44:10,524
- Can we go inside without the cameras?
- No, I'm sorry.

580
00:44:10,607 --> 00:44:12,026
It's not permitted.

581
00:44:13,652 --> 00:44:16,530
Lunch is ready back at the house.
Come with me.

582
00:44:16,613 --> 00:44:18,240
Yes. Nice.

583
00:44:19,366 --> 00:44:22,411
What are we doing?
Like a schnitzel thing, or a sausage?

584
00:44:23,203 --> 00:44:26,457
Is that offensive? I don't know
if that's, like, stereotyping.

585
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:36,091
Not for me, not for me.

586
00:44:36,175 --> 00:44:37,593
Thank you so much.

587
00:44:38,969 --> 00:44:41,430
There seems to be a little more.

588
00:44:41,513 --> 00:44:43,849
Dale, save some for everyone else.

589
00:44:43,932 --> 00:44:45,392
Oh, yeah, sorry.

590
00:44:46,268 --> 00:44:47,394
Dude.

591
00:45:07,331 --> 00:45:10,334
Hey, mind if I film you
for a moment?

592
00:45:19,176 --> 00:45:21,303
Fuck. Uh...

593
00:45:21,387 --> 00:45:23,305
- Hey. Hey. Uh--
- Oh, my gosh.

594
00:45:56,672 --> 00:45:58,424
What is that?

595
00:46:01,552 --> 00:46:03,929
No way.

596
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:30,581
- What's wrong?
- Shh. Listen.

597
00:46:30,664 --> 00:46:31,832
What?

598
00:46:35,169 --> 00:46:36,462
What is that?

599
00:46:38,046 --> 00:46:39,131
I don't know.

600
00:46:45,095 --> 00:46:46,388
What is that?

601
00:46:49,558 --> 00:46:51,351
Turn the light off.

602
00:46:51,435 --> 00:46:53,812
- They're gonna see it. Turn it off.
- Okay, right.

603
00:47:28,138 --> 00:47:29,598
Hey, let's just go back.

604
00:47:31,350 --> 00:47:34,603
Or get closer.

605
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:44,863
I can't see shit.

606
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,449
Go upstairs.

607
00:47:56,667 --> 00:47:58,919
Hold her down, brother.

608
00:48:03,048 --> 00:48:04,758
What are they doing?

609
00:48:04,841 --> 00:48:05,968
What?

610
00:48:14,601 --> 00:48:15,769
What? No.

611
00:48:24,152 --> 00:48:25,737
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

612
00:48:38,125 --> 00:48:40,294
It's starting to spread.

613
00:48:41,003 --> 00:48:42,629
I know.

614
00:48:42,713 --> 00:48:44,923
We have to do it now.

615
00:48:50,762 --> 00:48:52,180
We should follow them.

616
00:49:09,156 --> 00:49:10,657
Let's go. Come on.

617
00:49:14,661 --> 00:49:15,871
Fuck.

618
00:49:23,295 --> 00:49:24,504
What are they doing?

619
00:49:25,672 --> 00:49:27,674
Something fucked up.

620
00:49:37,267 --> 00:49:39,269
Why would they put it in a church?

621
00:49:39,353 --> 00:49:41,313
Definitely not to bless it.

622
00:49:46,568 --> 00:49:51,323
We hear this insane screaming,
dying noise in the middle of the night,

623
00:49:51,406 --> 00:49:54,618
and then we go and there's, like a--
Like, a goat sacrifice.

624
00:49:54,701 --> 00:49:56,745
- Look, animals get sick, right?
- Like, a goat--

625
00:49:57,579 --> 00:49:58,664
Some have birth defects.

626
00:49:58,747 --> 00:50:01,708
We can't feed them, take care of them.
We do what we have to.

627
00:50:01,792 --> 00:50:04,753
Okay, yeah, then why did they
bring the goats into your church?

628
00:50:04,836 --> 00:50:06,630
I told you not to go in the church.

629
00:50:07,172 --> 00:50:10,175
- We didn't go in the church, we saw them--
- Hey, what's going on here?

630
00:50:10,258 --> 00:50:11,426
What do you mean?

631
00:50:11,510 --> 00:50:14,429
Thought this was supposed to be
a documentary about where you're from.

632
00:50:14,513 --> 00:50:16,723
And-- And now you're--
You're sneaking out at night,

633
00:50:16,807 --> 00:50:19,643
and you're filming all kinds of stuff
that's not really your business.

634
00:50:19,726 --> 00:50:22,479
Like, I'm trying to help you.

635
00:50:22,562 --> 00:50:23,939
Don't make me regret it.

636
00:50:28,944 --> 00:50:31,279
They're definitely
hiding something from us.

637
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:33,240
Well, whatever it is,

638
00:50:33,323 --> 00:50:35,951
they obviously left Sam behind
to babysit us.

639
00:50:37,285 --> 00:50:39,413
So we'll have to find a way
to distract him.

640
00:50:41,748 --> 00:50:43,333
All right, who's first?

641
00:50:44,418 --> 00:50:45,627
You got it.

642
00:50:46,461 --> 00:50:47,921
Let's go, Dale.

643
00:50:48,422 --> 00:50:49,423
Okay.

644
00:50:50,173 --> 00:50:53,635
So you're gonna take both of these reins
in your left hand. Good.

645
00:50:53,719 --> 00:50:55,887
Right hand's gonna go
around that pommel there. Good.

646
00:50:55,971 --> 00:50:58,181
Your, uh, left foot's
gonna go in the stirrup.

647
00:50:58,265 --> 00:50:59,808
And then...

648
00:50:59,891 --> 00:51:00,976
Hold that tight.

649
00:51:01,059 --> 00:51:02,060
Whoa!

650
00:51:02,144 --> 00:51:03,145
- You're okay.
- Hey!

651
00:51:03,228 --> 00:51:07,315
- Look at you. I told you he likes you.
- Both hands on the reins.

652
00:51:07,399 --> 00:51:09,359
Good, good. Both hands, both hands.

653
00:51:09,443 --> 00:51:11,111
- Okay.
- You're okay, you're okay.

654
00:51:11,194 --> 00:51:12,612
Have fun.

655
00:51:12,696 --> 00:51:14,281
- No, no, no.
- Hey!

656
00:51:14,364 --> 00:51:15,532
Oh!

657
00:51:15,615 --> 00:51:17,826
- Hey, stop!
- You wrong for that.

658
00:51:17,909 --> 00:51:20,203
- Just pull back on the reins!
- Go, Dale.

659
00:51:20,871 --> 00:51:22,164
I'm squeezing!

660
00:51:22,664 --> 00:51:25,584
Stop! Tell him to stop!

661
00:51:37,387 --> 00:51:38,388
All right.

662
00:51:43,143 --> 00:51:44,144
Voila.

663
00:51:59,826 --> 00:52:01,203
Where are the pews?

664
00:52:01,703 --> 00:52:03,789
I thought this
was supposed to be a church.

665
00:52:07,834 --> 00:52:09,252
Whoa. Chris.

666
00:52:10,629 --> 00:52:12,214
There's paintings on the ground.

667
00:52:12,714 --> 00:52:13,715
Oh, yeah.

668
00:52:13,799 --> 00:52:17,052
God, it kind of looks like
the drawing that I saw in the attic.

669
00:52:17,761 --> 00:52:20,096
"Asmodeus."

670
00:52:32,818 --> 00:52:34,694
What the fuck, man?

671
00:52:40,909 --> 00:52:43,829
"The young and the weak
will suffer first"?

672
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:51,253
"Lest sacrifices be made."

673
00:52:57,175 --> 00:52:58,343
What is that?

674
00:53:02,514 --> 00:53:03,682
Okay...

675
00:53:06,476 --> 00:53:10,146
Is that some, like,
Cirque du Soleil stuff? Like, what--

676
00:53:20,031 --> 00:53:21,825
Saw those in the barn.

677
00:53:24,619 --> 00:53:25,912
That's a big bell.

678
00:53:28,248 --> 00:53:29,249
Margot.

679
00:53:29,791 --> 00:53:31,084
- Margot?
- Here.

680
00:53:31,167 --> 00:53:32,377
Oh.

681
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:33,628
Look.

682
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,840
- What is that?
- I think it's blood.

683
00:53:44,139 --> 00:53:45,682
Okay, hold on one second.

684
00:53:46,182 --> 00:53:47,225
Just one second.

685
00:53:49,477 --> 00:53:50,478
What?

686
00:54:02,657 --> 00:54:04,784
- This thing slides.
- Don't break it.

687
00:54:04,868 --> 00:54:07,078
- Help me push it. Help me push it over.
- Why?

688
00:54:07,162 --> 00:54:09,372
One, two...

689
00:54:12,167 --> 00:54:13,168
That's it.

690
00:54:14,669 --> 00:54:15,754
No way.

691
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,178
Fuck.

692
00:54:24,846 --> 00:54:25,889
Holy fuck.

693
00:54:26,890 --> 00:54:27,891
Holy fuck.

694
00:54:35,231 --> 00:54:37,275
- Whoa.
- Okay, so what?

695
00:54:37,859 --> 00:54:38,902
They just...

696
00:54:40,654 --> 00:54:42,489
threw the dead goats down there?

697
00:54:43,073 --> 00:54:44,115
But why?

698
00:54:46,117 --> 00:54:47,535
I don't know, some sort of...

699
00:54:48,870 --> 00:54:50,163
religious custom?

700
00:54:51,456 --> 00:54:52,540
Fuck.

701
00:54:53,875 --> 00:54:55,543
Hey, hey, be careful.

702
00:55:06,596 --> 00:55:09,224
Whoa, dude, that's--

703
00:55:09,307 --> 00:55:10,892
That's fucking far, yo.

704
00:55:16,648 --> 00:55:17,691
What?

705
00:55:19,401 --> 00:55:21,236
- Fuck it.
- Fuck what?

706
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:23,196
Fuck what?

707
00:55:23,279 --> 00:55:24,739
What? Mm-mmm, mm-mmm.

708
00:55:24,823 --> 00:55:27,826
Hard no this time.
We don't even know if this thing is safe.

709
00:55:27,909 --> 00:55:30,704
It's here. I mean,
they're using it for a reason.

710
00:55:30,787 --> 00:55:34,457
Okay, Margot, I can't just stand here
and let you do this. Come on, now.

711
00:55:34,541 --> 00:55:37,711
Chris, we get one shot, one chance.
I'm not messing it up.

712
00:55:37,794 --> 00:55:39,462
It's too important.

713
00:55:39,546 --> 00:55:41,798
Just give me the camera.
Man the pulley. We got this.

714
00:55:41,881 --> 00:55:43,341
The fuck we got this.

715
00:55:47,262 --> 00:55:48,930
You sure about this?

716
00:55:49,014 --> 00:55:50,015
Yes.

717
00:55:50,557 --> 00:55:51,766
It's good.

718
00:55:58,815 --> 00:56:00,233
Do I look cool?

719
00:56:00,775 --> 00:56:02,193
No, you look crazy.

720
00:56:06,197 --> 00:56:07,198
Thank you.

721
00:56:11,411 --> 00:56:12,620
Okay.

722
00:56:15,415 --> 00:56:18,626
Okay, just... let it out real slow.

723
00:56:19,252 --> 00:56:20,795
Slow.

724
00:56:23,757 --> 00:56:24,758
Okay.

725
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:28,845
- Whoa. Are you okay?
- Yeah.

726
00:56:29,721 --> 00:56:31,431
Yeah, I'm good. Keep going.

727
00:56:45,612 --> 00:56:46,654
You good?

728
00:56:46,738 --> 00:56:47,739
Yep.

729
00:56:58,958 --> 00:57:00,210
Jesus, what is that?

730
00:57:00,919 --> 00:57:01,961
What?

731
00:57:04,047 --> 00:57:05,381
There's a smell.

732
00:57:05,465 --> 00:57:06,549
Fuck.

733
00:57:07,425 --> 00:57:08,676
It's pretty bad.

734
00:57:12,055 --> 00:57:13,181
You okay?

735
00:57:14,432 --> 00:57:15,767
Yeah.

736
00:57:15,850 --> 00:57:17,393
I'm-- I'm good.

737
00:57:17,477 --> 00:57:18,520
All right.

738
00:57:25,568 --> 00:57:27,153
What the fuck? What?

739
00:57:34,911 --> 00:57:36,830
There's crosses everywhere.

740
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:38,581
What?

741
00:57:38,665 --> 00:57:40,333
There's crosses everywhere.

742
00:57:41,793 --> 00:57:43,461
Do you wanna keep going?

743
00:57:44,754 --> 00:57:45,797
Yeah.

744
00:57:46,589 --> 00:57:47,924
Yeah, keep going.

745
00:58:09,112 --> 00:58:10,155
Okay.

746
00:58:13,074 --> 00:58:14,742
I can see the bottom!

747
00:58:22,417 --> 00:58:24,502
Chr-- Chris?

748
00:58:27,755 --> 00:58:28,798
Chris?

749
00:58:37,390 --> 00:58:38,641
It's stuck.

750
00:58:40,310 --> 00:58:42,687
Hold on. Hold on. The pulley's stuck.

751
00:58:49,152 --> 00:58:50,570
So fucking close.

752
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:55,950
I think I can reach it if I lean.

753
00:59:00,121 --> 00:59:02,540
Hey, there-- there's something down here!

754
00:59:04,584 --> 00:59:05,710
A room!

755
00:59:30,318 --> 00:59:32,445
Okay. Who was that?

756
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:34,906
Wait, go back.

757
00:59:38,284 --> 00:59:40,370
Who...

758
00:59:41,788 --> 00:59:44,040
Hey, Chris, I'm done. Pull me up.

759
00:59:47,168 --> 00:59:50,004
Hey, please. I'm serious. Pull me up.

760
00:59:53,633 --> 00:59:55,510
Chris?

761
00:59:55,593 --> 00:59:57,303
Hey, pull me up!

762
01:00:05,561 --> 01:00:08,189
Look, if you just listen to it,
then you'll understand.

763
01:00:08,273 --> 01:00:10,566
You could've hurt yourself.
You scared the shit out of me.

764
01:00:10,650 --> 01:00:12,443
I just-- That's all I'm saying.

765
01:00:12,527 --> 01:00:14,445
It's gotta be known,
like, acknowledged at least.

766
01:00:14,529 --> 01:00:16,698
I'ma listen to it.
I'll listen to it, but it's like--

767
01:00:16,781 --> 01:00:18,825
- Okay.
- Come on.

768
01:00:19,867 --> 01:00:21,369
I'm listening to it.

769
01:00:23,162 --> 01:00:25,248
Dale, is that booze?

770
01:00:25,331 --> 01:00:27,875
Whiskey, man.
I just fell off a fucking horse.

771
01:00:29,502 --> 01:00:30,795
<i>Chris.</i>

772
01:00:31,963 --> 01:00:33,131
<i>- Chris!</i>
- Okay.

773
01:00:33,214 --> 01:00:35,508
<i>Pull me up!</i>

774
01:00:35,591 --> 01:00:36,884
<i>Chris, pull me up!</i>

775
01:00:36,968 --> 01:00:38,594
<i>- Pull me up!</i>
- Go back.

776
01:00:42,098 --> 01:00:44,100
<i>Chris!</i>

777
01:00:45,435 --> 01:00:46,853
<i>- Pull me up!</i>
- You hear that?

778
01:00:46,936 --> 01:00:49,147
<i>- Chris, pull me up!</i>
- There's something down there.

779
01:00:51,357 --> 01:00:54,319
An animal?

780
01:00:54,402 --> 01:00:57,196
Shit, they're throwing goats
down a mine shaft

781
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:58,906
to feed an animal...

782
01:00:59,699 --> 01:01:01,951
in a cave a hundred feet underground?

783
01:01:03,453 --> 01:01:05,163
Fuck those guys.

784
01:01:15,882 --> 01:01:17,884
Good. Steady.

785
01:01:18,551 --> 01:01:20,178
Push it, left, left.

786
01:01:30,271 --> 01:01:32,607
Um, Jacob?

787
01:03:04,115 --> 01:03:05,158
What?

788
01:03:22,592 --> 01:03:23,676
Fuck.

789
01:03:25,011 --> 01:03:26,053
What?

790
01:03:41,736 --> 01:03:42,945
Whoa, whoa.

791
01:03:43,029 --> 01:03:44,864
Battery? Totally fucking dead.

792
01:03:44,947 --> 01:03:47,617
- They've been watching me.
- What?

793
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:51,329
Sam didn't leave the community
to find himself. He left to find me.

794
01:03:51,412 --> 01:03:55,458
- This whole thing's like a fucking setup.
- Okay, just slow down. Slow down.

795
01:03:59,837 --> 01:04:01,339
Is everything all right?

796
01:04:03,591 --> 01:04:05,343
Yeah, um--

797
01:04:06,427 --> 01:04:07,929
I'm okay, thank you.

798
01:04:08,554 --> 01:04:09,639
Good.

799
01:04:10,681 --> 01:04:11,933
It's good to hear.

800
01:04:16,646 --> 01:04:19,273
Okay, wait.
I thought they couldn't have computers.

801
01:04:19,357 --> 01:04:21,776
Chris, the emails went back
for over a year.

802
01:04:21,859 --> 01:04:24,028
Way before Sam contacted me.

803
01:04:24,111 --> 01:04:26,614
I mean, they knew where I live.
They have my address.

804
01:04:26,697 --> 01:04:28,324
They fucking have pictures of me.

805
01:04:28,407 --> 01:04:30,826
- They had my class schedule.
- What the fuck?

806
01:04:30,910 --> 01:04:32,161
They were watching me.

807
01:04:32,245 --> 01:04:34,872
They clearly brought us here for a reason.

808
01:04:34,956 --> 01:04:37,208
- Why would they do that?
- I don't fucking know.

809
01:04:37,291 --> 01:04:39,377
I don't fucking know,
but it's freaking me out.

810
01:04:39,460 --> 01:04:40,753
I wanna go home.

811
01:04:41,712 --> 01:04:44,632
- I wanna go.
- Okay. Okay, okay. But look, how?

812
01:04:45,132 --> 01:04:48,135
We have no car, we have no phone,

813
01:04:48,219 --> 01:04:50,346
and there's no one around for 30 miles.

814
01:04:50,429 --> 01:04:51,514
Fuck.

815
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:53,766
This is so fucked.

816
01:04:58,229 --> 01:04:59,230
Hey.

817
01:05:00,356 --> 01:05:01,607
Tomorrow.

818
01:05:01,691 --> 01:05:04,068
Okay? It's all good.
First thing in the morning,

819
01:05:04,151 --> 01:05:06,070
we'll head into town
and get a battery for the van.

820
01:05:11,075 --> 01:05:12,243
Okay?

821
01:05:47,028 --> 01:05:48,404
Dale, wake up.

822
01:05:52,325 --> 01:05:53,534
Wake up.

823
01:05:54,118 --> 01:05:55,620
Wake up.

824
01:05:57,330 --> 01:05:58,456
Fuck.

825
01:06:00,958 --> 01:06:02,335
Wake up.

826
01:06:07,381 --> 01:06:08,799
What?

827
01:06:19,352 --> 01:06:20,603
Chris, wake up.

828
01:06:21,562 --> 01:06:23,856
Please, wake up!

829
01:06:26,984 --> 01:06:28,986
Who the fuck is that?

830
01:07:31,757 --> 01:07:32,925
Margot?

831
01:07:36,971 --> 01:07:38,097
Chris.

832
01:07:43,769 --> 01:07:45,521
Oh, Jesus Christ.

833
01:07:46,397 --> 01:07:48,441
Hey, Margot. Margot?

834
01:07:48,524 --> 01:07:49,525
Are you okay?

835
01:07:57,324 --> 01:07:58,909
She's resting again.

836
01:08:01,787 --> 01:08:03,622
What was wrong with her?

837
01:08:03,706 --> 01:08:08,377
I'd say it's exhaustion coupled with
an unusually severe menstrual cycle.

838
01:08:08,461 --> 01:08:11,213
She lost a fair amount of blood,
but she's going to be fine.

839
01:08:11,297 --> 01:08:13,340
Well, shouldn't we
take her to a hospital?

840
01:08:13,424 --> 01:08:15,551
No, she doesn't need a hospital.
She needs rest.

841
01:08:15,634 --> 01:08:18,637
Okay, no offense,
but are you even a real doctor?

842
01:08:19,138 --> 01:08:21,015
Listen, let her get some rest.

843
01:08:21,098 --> 01:08:24,560
If her condition worsens,
we'll get her to a hospital.

844
01:08:31,025 --> 01:08:33,110
Unusually strong menstrual cycle?

845
01:08:33,986 --> 01:08:35,321
Do you believe that?

846
01:08:38,574 --> 01:08:41,494
Man, this is so stupid.
Nobody's coming.

847
01:08:41,577 --> 01:08:42,828
You got a better idea?

848
01:08:43,412 --> 01:08:45,748
I don't see any Amish auto part stores
around here.

849
01:08:48,375 --> 01:08:49,710
Look.

850
01:08:49,794 --> 01:08:51,253
- Oh!
- Ah!

851
01:08:51,337 --> 01:08:53,297
- Thank God.
- Oh, fuck, man. Yes.

852
01:08:53,380 --> 01:08:54,590
Oh, thank God.

853
01:08:55,132 --> 01:08:57,259
I think it's a mail truck. Hey!

854
01:08:58,886 --> 01:09:00,763
- Hey, man.
- Hey there.

855
01:09:00,846 --> 01:09:03,015
Will you give us a ride into town?
Our battery died.

856
01:09:03,098 --> 01:09:04,642
- Yeah. That's all right.
- Hop in?

857
01:09:04,725 --> 01:09:06,644
- Come on in.
- Thank you.

858
01:09:06,727 --> 01:09:07,770
Thank you so much.

859
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:09,980
That's a nice camera you got.

860
01:09:10,064 --> 01:09:12,107
We're shooting a documentary
up at the Beiler farm.

861
01:09:12,191 --> 01:09:15,194
Oh, yeah? What's y'alls documentary about?

862
01:09:15,277 --> 01:09:16,862
Amish people.

863
01:09:16,946 --> 01:09:18,697
- Amish people?
- Yeah.

864
01:09:19,740 --> 01:09:22,201
You guys staying at the Beiler farm?

865
01:09:22,284 --> 01:09:25,746
Yeah. Actually, we've been there
for about a week now filming.

866
01:09:25,830 --> 01:09:30,292
Yeah, all right.
Well, you know the Beilers ain't Amish.

867
01:09:30,376 --> 01:09:32,586
Uh, what? Of course they are.

868
01:09:32,670 --> 01:09:35,047
Think they are? Right.

869
01:09:35,130 --> 01:09:38,509
Hey, I've been working this route
for over 40 years

870
01:09:38,592 --> 01:09:42,012
and I know every family
within a 50-square-mile area,

871
01:09:42,096 --> 01:09:44,306
and most of them are Amish.

872
01:09:45,015 --> 01:09:46,684
Now, they all will tell you...

873
01:09:47,685 --> 01:09:50,187
the Beilers ain't Amish.

874
01:09:52,231 --> 01:09:54,108
- Can I help you?
- Car battery?

875
01:09:54,191 --> 01:09:56,068
- What size?
- 31C.

876
01:09:56,151 --> 01:09:58,070
31C. Let me go check for you.
Be right back.

877
01:09:58,153 --> 01:09:59,446
Fuck, man.

878
01:09:59,530 --> 01:10:01,907
Maybe we shouldn't have
left Margot, man. Maybe--

879
01:10:01,991 --> 01:10:03,576
Why would they pretend to be Amish?

880
01:10:03,659 --> 01:10:06,078
I don't know.
Maybe hiding in plain sight, right?

881
01:10:06,161 --> 01:10:08,205
It's like... I-I don't know.

882
01:10:08,289 --> 01:10:11,667
They-- They look like them, they blend in,
I mean, they're off the grid.

883
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:13,043
It's kind of a genius idea.

884
01:10:13,127 --> 01:10:15,713
Why would they need to be Amish?
What's the point in that?

885
01:10:15,796 --> 01:10:18,382
- What size battery was it again?
- 31C.

886
01:10:18,465 --> 01:10:21,594
Yeah, I'm not seeing it here.
I'm gonna go check in the back for you.

887
01:10:21,677 --> 01:10:24,513
Hey, uh, you mind
if we use your Internet for a second, man?

888
01:10:24,597 --> 01:10:26,056
- Not at all. Have at it.
- Cool.

889
01:10:26,140 --> 01:10:28,183
Just don't look up anything weird.

890
01:10:28,267 --> 01:10:29,977
Go, Dale.

891
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:32,771
What do you want me to look up?
"Fake Amish people"?

892
01:10:32,855 --> 01:10:34,231
No, search "Asmodeus."

893
01:10:34,315 --> 01:10:35,691
- Asmodeus?
- Yeah.

894
01:10:35,774 --> 01:10:37,735
That's the name we found at the church.

895
01:10:42,781 --> 01:10:44,033
Shit.

896
01:10:44,116 --> 01:10:46,744
"The demonic prince of lust,
suffering and wrath.

897
01:10:46,827 --> 01:10:50,581
Asmodeus, or Asmodaios,
is the overlord of the Nine Hells.

898
01:10:50,664 --> 01:10:52,166
He is the prince of demons--"

899
01:10:52,249 --> 01:10:54,877
I fucking knew it, man.
These people are devil worshippers.

900
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:56,712
Click that right there at the top.

901
01:10:59,465 --> 01:11:03,218
"The Norwegian village of Beskytter
was beset by a pestilence.

902
01:11:03,302 --> 01:11:05,930
Crops and livestock perished,
neighbor turned against neighbor

903
01:11:06,013 --> 01:11:09,433
- in abhorrent acts of violence."
- The same stuff we saw in the church.

904
01:11:09,516 --> 01:11:12,519
"It was believed to be
the work of the demon, Asmodeus.

905
01:11:13,228 --> 01:11:17,191
In their desperation, the village
turned to the White Witch for help.

906
01:11:17,274 --> 01:11:20,027
It is said the witch trapped the demon
inside a chosen woman of God,

907
01:11:20,110 --> 01:11:23,405
her body a holy vessel
to ensnare the powerful entity.

908
01:11:25,658 --> 01:11:27,910
Through her bloodline,
from daughter to daughter,

909
01:11:27,993 --> 01:11:32,039
the demon, Asmodeus, be passed,
lest it be unleashed upon the world."

910
01:11:33,832 --> 01:11:35,000
Fuck, man.

911
01:11:35,084 --> 01:11:37,211
They, like, trapped them
inside these women's bodies?

912
01:11:37,294 --> 01:11:38,545
Okay, come on.

913
01:11:38,629 --> 01:11:42,508
Like, witches, demons?
Like, that's not-- that's not real, right?

914
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:44,593
Even if it's not real, they could still--

915
01:11:45,260 --> 01:11:47,429
If they believe it, then think about it.

916
01:11:47,513 --> 01:11:49,473
Margot's mom runs off, right?

917
01:11:49,556 --> 01:11:53,060
And she hides her baby to keep her away
from these cultish motherfuckers,

918
01:11:53,143 --> 01:11:54,895
but they still find her somehow

919
01:11:54,979 --> 01:11:57,523
and they lure her back to do
whatever this shit is to her.

920
01:11:58,399 --> 01:12:01,485
All right, you guys.
Got the last 31C right here.

921
01:12:01,568 --> 01:12:04,029
Oh, shit, dude.
You're a lifesaver, man.

922
01:12:04,113 --> 01:12:05,114
All right.

923
01:12:07,533 --> 01:12:08,909
Fuck.

924
01:12:10,953 --> 01:12:14,248
All right. I'm gonna go deal with
this battery. Meet me at the house.

925
01:12:14,331 --> 01:12:17,292
- You sure you don't need help?
- No, man. Just get Margot and our shit.

926
01:12:17,376 --> 01:12:20,838
- Let's get the fuck out of here.
- Yeah. Fuck this place.

927
01:12:25,676 --> 01:12:26,885
Hello?

928
01:12:27,970 --> 01:12:28,971
Margot.

929
01:12:33,017 --> 01:12:34,476
Fuck. Mary.

930
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:35,644
Hey, hey. Mary.

931
01:12:35,728 --> 01:12:37,062
Wait, wait, wait. No.

932
01:12:37,146 --> 01:12:38,313
Mary.

933
01:12:38,397 --> 01:12:39,898
Mary, where's your dad?

934
01:12:40,607 --> 01:12:42,151
Mary, open up.

935
01:12:42,234 --> 01:12:43,360
Fuck.

936
01:12:45,446 --> 01:12:48,198
Margot, it is time to go.

937
01:12:49,116 --> 01:12:50,868
What the fuck? Our shit.

938
01:12:50,951 --> 01:12:52,619
Where the fuck is our shit?

939
01:13:01,837 --> 01:13:04,131
What the fuck is going on, Sam?

940
01:13:04,923 --> 01:13:06,258
Where's Margot?

941
01:13:08,010 --> 01:13:09,094
Sam?

942
01:13:10,012 --> 01:13:12,097
Where the fuck is Margot, man?

943
01:13:14,683 --> 01:13:17,853
Women are
the most powerful creatures on Earth.

944
01:13:17,936 --> 01:13:18,937
What?

945
01:13:19,021 --> 01:13:20,606
Givers of life.

946
01:13:22,066 --> 01:13:24,985
That is why our sisters bear this burden.

947
01:13:26,612 --> 01:13:29,364
They're the only ones
strong enough to hold him back.

948
01:13:32,034 --> 01:13:33,744
It's time.

949
01:13:35,287 --> 01:13:36,663
Stay behind locked doors.

950
01:13:37,498 --> 01:13:39,750
Don't come out
until the bell stops ringing.

951
01:13:39,833 --> 01:13:41,919
What? Sam.

952
01:13:42,002 --> 01:13:44,254
Dude, where are you going? Sam!

953
01:14:24,586 --> 01:14:27,047
Margot?

954
01:14:30,050 --> 01:14:31,176
Margot?

955
01:14:34,930 --> 01:14:36,473
Okay. Easy, man.

956
01:14:36,557 --> 01:14:39,184
- Don't try to stop this.
- Jacob, just put the gun down.

957
01:14:39,268 --> 01:14:42,104
Her body is the only thing
that can hold the demon.

958
01:14:42,604 --> 01:14:45,899
If you set him free,
he'll be able to possess anyone,

959
01:14:45,983 --> 01:14:47,401
jumping from body to body.

960
01:14:47,484 --> 01:14:49,361
- What are you doing to her?
- He'll kill us all.

961
01:14:49,444 --> 01:14:52,322
He'll kill every last one of us.

962
01:14:53,448 --> 01:14:56,201
Just put the gun down, man.

963
01:14:56,285 --> 01:14:59,788
Please, man. You don't want to do this.

964
01:15:32,905 --> 01:15:35,824
Fuck. Oh, fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck.

965
01:15:53,675 --> 01:15:55,469
Hold on, Margot. I'm coming.

966
01:16:10,359 --> 01:16:12,277
Oh-- Oh, God.

967
01:16:16,448 --> 01:16:17,449
Fuck.

968
01:16:18,742 --> 01:16:20,369
Margot? Fuck.

969
01:16:21,203 --> 01:16:22,412
Margot?

970
01:16:26,959 --> 01:16:28,252
Margot?

971
01:16:30,295 --> 01:16:32,172
Okay, fuck it. Fuck.

972
01:16:36,093 --> 01:16:38,095
Okay.

973
01:16:41,682 --> 01:16:43,100
Oh, God.

974
01:16:46,228 --> 01:16:48,355
Margot?

975
01:16:48,438 --> 01:16:50,816
Margot!

976
01:16:52,985 --> 01:16:54,903
Margot.

977
01:16:56,822 --> 01:16:58,031
The fuck?

978
01:16:59,032 --> 01:17:00,742
What are you doing? Shit.

979
01:17:00,826 --> 01:17:03,453
What are you doing to her?

980
01:17:03,537 --> 01:17:05,080
Margot, get the fuck up!

981
01:17:05,580 --> 01:17:08,000
Fuck. Margot! Just stop it, all right.

982
01:17:08,583 --> 01:17:10,961
I said stop it.

983
01:17:12,963 --> 01:17:15,048
Margot? Margot. Margot.

984
01:17:15,841 --> 01:17:17,884
- Fuck.
- The salt. The salt.

985
01:17:17,968 --> 01:17:20,971
Please. Wake up, Margot.
Come on. It's time to go. Up, up, up.

986
01:17:21,054 --> 01:17:23,515
- Margot. Margot, get up.
- The salt. The salt.

987
01:17:23,598 --> 01:17:25,517
Margot, come on. Get up! Please wake up.

988
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:27,102
Yeah. Come on. Yeah.

989
01:17:27,185 --> 01:17:29,646
No! No!

990
01:17:29,730 --> 01:17:30,731
- Back up!
- No!

991
01:17:30,814 --> 01:17:32,441
- Back up or I'll fuckin'--
- You don't--

992
01:17:32,524 --> 01:17:34,401
You don't know what you're doing!

993
01:17:37,738 --> 01:17:39,156
The fuck is that?

994
01:17:39,239 --> 01:17:40,782
Goddamn. Margot, run!

995
01:17:40,866 --> 01:17:42,784
Run, Margot! Run!

996
01:17:45,370 --> 01:17:47,372
Run! Fucking run!

997
01:17:52,210 --> 01:17:53,337
Run, Margot!

998
01:17:53,420 --> 01:17:55,047
Run! Fuck!

999
01:17:56,381 --> 01:17:59,718
What the fuck was that?

1000
01:18:01,386 --> 01:18:03,513
Oh, shit. No, no, no.

1001
01:18:03,597 --> 01:18:05,807
Fuck! Fuck.
How are we gonna get out of here?

1002
01:18:05,891 --> 01:18:07,392
There's gotta be a way out.

1003
01:18:07,476 --> 01:18:09,478
There's gotta be a fucking way out.
There's gotta be. Come on.

1004
01:18:09,561 --> 01:18:11,897
- Come on, come on, Chris. Fucking think.
- Hello?

1005
01:18:11,980 --> 01:18:13,482
Holy shit. Dale?

1006
01:18:13,565 --> 01:18:16,943
Dale! It's us! We need you
to pull us back up, man!

1007
01:18:17,027 --> 01:18:20,280
- What the fuck's going on, man?
- We're stuck! Just pull up the pulley!

1008
01:18:20,364 --> 01:18:22,199
We need you to pull the pulley!

1009
01:18:22,282 --> 01:18:23,575
Okay!

1010
01:18:23,658 --> 01:18:26,370
Okay. Come on. Come on, Margot.

1011
01:18:26,453 --> 01:18:29,289
Holy fuck.
What the fuck was that thing, man?

1012
01:18:29,373 --> 01:18:31,833
Jesus. Okay.

1013
01:18:33,126 --> 01:18:35,003
Here. Hold on tight. Hold on.

1014
01:18:35,879 --> 01:18:37,672
All right, pull it up now, Dale!

1015
01:18:38,340 --> 01:18:39,674
Now, now, now, now!

1016
01:18:40,300 --> 01:18:42,302
Okay.

1017
01:18:42,386 --> 01:18:44,805
We're almost there. We're almost there.
We're almost there.

1018
01:18:50,268 --> 01:18:51,478
Faster, Dale!

1019
01:18:52,813 --> 01:18:54,898
Come on, man. Come on.

1020
01:18:54,981 --> 01:18:56,191
Fuck me.

1021
01:18:59,736 --> 01:19:00,779
Fuck me.

1022
01:19:01,738 --> 01:19:02,739
Okay.

1023
01:19:05,534 --> 01:19:07,411
Come on, man. Come on, man.

1024
01:19:07,494 --> 01:19:08,954
Don't leave a brother down here. Fuck.

1025
01:19:12,165 --> 01:19:13,583
Oh, shit.

1026
01:19:21,174 --> 01:19:23,844
Come on, man!
Pull the fucking rope now, man! Now!

1027
01:19:25,929 --> 01:19:28,140
Thank God.

1028
01:19:31,852 --> 01:19:34,229
All right, Dale. Pull me up.
Pull me up, man.

1029
01:19:35,856 --> 01:19:37,482
Faster, man. Now, now, now.

1030
01:19:37,566 --> 01:19:39,901
Oh, fuck! Pull me up, Dale! Pull me up!

1031
01:19:39,985 --> 01:19:42,028
Pull me up, Dale! Pull me up!

1032
01:19:42,112 --> 01:19:43,113
Come on, Dale!

1033
01:19:45,198 --> 01:19:46,199
Fuck.

1034
01:19:49,995 --> 01:19:52,038
Good job. Stop. Yeah.

1035
01:19:57,335 --> 01:19:59,504
We gotta get the fuck out of here.
Did you fix the battery?

1036
01:19:59,588 --> 01:20:01,256
- Yeah, it's ready.
- All right, shit. Let's go.

1037
01:20:03,383 --> 01:20:05,385
- Margot, you good?
- Margot. Now, Margot.

1038
01:20:05,469 --> 01:20:07,471
Margot.

1039
01:20:07,554 --> 01:20:10,098
What the fuck? Dale, just pick her up.

1040
01:20:12,726 --> 01:20:14,811
No, no, no, no. Fuck.

1041
01:20:14,895 --> 01:20:16,521
No, no. No.

1042
01:20:16,605 --> 01:20:18,273
Fuck.

1043
01:20:21,443 --> 01:20:22,903
Run! Run!

1044
01:20:28,909 --> 01:20:30,744
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1045
01:20:30,827 --> 01:20:32,245
- Fuck that.
- Run, Dale. Run!

1046
01:20:33,079 --> 01:20:34,498
Margot, come on! Come on!

1047
01:20:36,374 --> 01:20:38,960
What is that thing, man?

1048
01:20:43,215 --> 01:20:45,634
Which way? Come on, man. I can't see shit.

1049
01:20:49,095 --> 01:20:50,472
- Chris!
- Dale, which way?

1050
01:20:50,555 --> 01:20:52,098
Margot, where are you?

1051
01:20:59,981 --> 01:21:01,900
Go, Margot! Run! Run, Margot!

1052
01:21:44,985 --> 01:21:46,319
Oh, God!

1053
01:21:52,701 --> 01:21:54,578
Come on. Let's start moving.

1054
01:22:08,592 --> 01:22:10,677
Quick, this way. This way.

1055
01:22:29,487 --> 01:22:30,864
Margot?

1056
01:22:30,947 --> 01:22:32,490
Margot? Margot!

1057
01:22:40,540 --> 01:22:41,625
Margot?

1058
01:22:42,959 --> 01:22:45,086
Oh, shit. Margot. Okay, okay.

1059
01:22:45,754 --> 01:22:46,963
Margot?

1060
01:22:52,052 --> 01:22:54,429
Margot, Margot, Margot. Oh, my God.

1061
01:22:54,512 --> 01:22:56,640
Okay. I'm gonna get us out of here.

1062
01:22:57,515 --> 01:22:59,434
Oh, shit. Margot, run. Run!

1063
01:23:01,686 --> 01:23:03,271
Go, go, go.

1064
01:23:14,783 --> 01:23:15,784
Shit.

1065
01:23:27,212 --> 01:23:28,463
We're on the wrong side.

1066
01:23:28,546 --> 01:23:30,882
We need to get up and over
to get to the van.

1067
01:23:50,443 --> 01:23:52,070
The van's right there.

1068
01:23:52,153 --> 01:23:53,613
Okay?

1069
01:23:53,697 --> 01:23:54,864
It's right there.

1070
01:24:17,303 --> 01:24:20,181
Stop! Get off of him! Sarah!

1071
01:24:23,393 --> 01:24:24,728
Look at me.

1072
01:24:29,357 --> 01:24:30,483
Look at me.

1073
01:24:34,654 --> 01:24:36,364
Look at my face.

1074
01:24:39,743 --> 01:24:40,994
Can you see?

1075
01:24:44,122 --> 01:24:45,957
Do you remember me?

1076
01:24:49,252 --> 01:24:50,879
It's me.

1077
01:24:53,548 --> 01:24:55,091
Your daughter.

1078
01:24:58,428 --> 01:25:00,096
I'm here now...

1079
01:25:03,683 --> 01:25:05,101
Mom.

1080
01:25:07,187 --> 01:25:08,605
I'm here now.

1081
01:25:34,881 --> 01:25:37,091
Fuck. Are you okay?

1082
01:25:41,179 --> 01:25:42,972
Yeah.

1083
01:25:50,730 --> 01:25:51,940
We gotta go.

1084
01:26:00,448 --> 01:26:01,533
Let's go.

1085
01:26:07,914 --> 01:26:10,124
Okay. Lock it.

1086
01:26:10,625 --> 01:26:11,709
Okay.

1087
01:26:13,461 --> 01:26:14,462
Keys. Keys.

1088
01:26:15,296 --> 01:26:17,090
Where the fuck you put the keys?

1089
01:26:17,674 --> 01:26:18,758
Dale.

1090
01:26:21,386 --> 01:26:22,887
Fuck!

1091
01:26:25,765 --> 01:26:26,766
Okay.

1092
01:26:27,559 --> 01:26:28,935
All right, we should go get it.

1093
01:26:35,942 --> 01:26:38,611
Oh, my God. No.

1094
01:26:38,695 --> 01:26:40,572
All right. Here. I'll do it.

1095
01:26:40,655 --> 01:26:43,324
Margot, I'll get it.
Just shine that light over here.

1096
01:26:43,408 --> 01:26:45,827
Okay. Keys, keys, keys, keys.

1097
01:26:52,375 --> 01:26:56,087
Margot, let's go. Margot, now. Come on.

1098
01:26:56,170 --> 01:26:58,089
Margot, now. Let's go.

1099
01:26:59,591 --> 01:27:00,758
Let's go.

1100
01:27:47,263 --> 01:27:49,807
We're almost there. We're almost there.

1101
01:27:49,891 --> 01:27:51,100
Okay.

1102
01:28:00,526 --> 01:28:02,862
Fuck. Come on.

Fuck me.

01:28:10,870 --> 01:28:13,623
Come on. Come on. Fuck.

Oh, shit!

01:28:39,399 --> 01:28:41,025
Fuck.

1110
01:28:41,109 --> 01:28:42,276
Oh, fuck.
