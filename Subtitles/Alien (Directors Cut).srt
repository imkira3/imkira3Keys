1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:06:56,875 --> 00:07:01,879
- Got any biscuits over there?
- Here's some cornbread.

3
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:06,217
I am cold.

4
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:09,178
- Still with us, Brett?
- Right.

5
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:14,434
- I feel dead.
- Anybody ever tell you look dead?

6
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:21,399
Oh, yeah. I forgot something.

7
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:25,611
Before we dock,
we ought to discuss the bonus situation.

8
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:28,948
Brett and I think we deserve full shares.

9
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:33,828
Mr. Parker and I feel the bonus situation
has never been equitable.

10
00:07:33,996 --> 00:07:37,248
You get what you're contracted for,
like everybody else.

11
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:39,667
But everybody else gets more than us.

12
00:07:39,835 --> 00:07:42,462
Dallas, Mother wants to talk to you.

13
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:46,591
I saw it. Yellow light's for my eyes only.

14
00:07:46,842 --> 00:07:49,469
Get dressed, huh? Parker?

15
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:52,972
I haven't finished my coffee.
It's the only thing good on this ship.

16
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:50,780
Morning, Mother.

17
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,105
- Right?
- OK.

18
00:09:24,273 --> 00:09:26,482
Plug us in.

19
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:29,652
Thank you.

20
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:36,450
- Where is Earth?
- You should know.

21
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:39,620
It's not our system.

22
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:41,414
Scan.

23
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,627
I can't believe this.

24
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:49,463
Contact traffic control.

25
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:53,301
This is commercial towing vehicle
Nostromo,

26
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:58,639
out of the Solomons,
registration number 1 80924609,

27
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:03,269
calling Antarctica traffic control.
Do you read me?

28
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:06,564
Commercial towing vehicle Nostromo,
out of the Solomons,

29
00:10:06,732 --> 00:10:11,652
registration number 1 80924609.

30
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,905
- Nothing.
- Keep trying.

31
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:19,994
Calling Antarctica traffic control.
Do you read me, Antarctica?

32
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:24,624
I've found it. Just short of Zeta II Reticuli.

33
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:29,670
- We haven't reached the outer rim yet.
- That's hard to believe.

34
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:32,715
What the hell are we doing out here?

35
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:37,136
Don't know.
What the hell are you talking about?

36
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:40,640
- That's not our system.
- I know that.

37
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:46,854
Ever notice how they never come down
here? This is where the work is, right?

38
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:53,486
Same reason we get a half share to their
one. Our time is their time. Same old shit.

39
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:55,988
I think l know why they don't come down.

40
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:58,824
It's because of you.
You have no personality.

41
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:11,587
- You happen to be in my seat. Can I have it?
- Of course. Sorry.

42
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:19,553
What's happening now, baby?

43
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:26,185
Some of you may have figured out we're
not home yet. We're only halfway there.

44
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:30,731
- What?
- Mother's interrupted our course.

45
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:31,899
Why?

46
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:36,612
She's programmed to do that
should certain conditions arise. They have.

47
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:41,492
It seems she has intercepted
a transmission of unknown origin.

48
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:45,579
- She got us up to check it out.
- A transmission? Out here?

49
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:47,623
What kind of transmission?

50
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:51,502
Acoustical beacon
that repeats at intervals of 12 seconds.

51
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,379
- SOS?
- I don't know.

52
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:56,424
- Human?
- Unknown.

53
00:11:56,591 --> 00:12:00,386
- So what?
- We are obligated under Section...

54
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:05,850
- This is a commercial ship, not a rescue ship.
- Right.

55
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:08,853
It's not in my contract, this kind of duty.

56
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:13,691
And what about money? Give me
some money, I'd be happy to oblige.

57
00:12:13,859 --> 00:12:16,569
Let's go over the bonus situation.

58
00:12:16,737 --> 00:12:19,280
I'm sorry, can I say something?

59
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:23,409
There is a clause which states
"Any systematized transmission

60
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:26,871
indicating intelligent origin
must be investigated...

61
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:29,290
I wanna go home and party.

62
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:31,751
Will you just listen to the man?

63
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:37,631
..on penalty of total forfeiture of shares."

64
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,175
No money.

65
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:42,261
You got that?

66
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:45,139
- Well, yeah.
- We're going in.

67
00:12:45,307 --> 00:12:47,057
We're going in.

68
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:58,194
Approaching orbital apogee. Mark.

69
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:03,199
Equatorial orbit nailed.

70
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,341
DOR's in line.

71
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:24,345
- Status on the lifters?
- Give me an AC pressure reading.

72
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:33,479
48 seconds and counting.

73
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,734
Prepare to disengage from platform.

74
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:40,903
20 seconds.

75
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:43,614
1 8, 1 7...

76
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:50,663
13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7,

77
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:56,460
6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 .

78
00:13:56,628 --> 00:13:58,003
Lock.

79
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:00,005
Disengage.

80
00:14:05,095 --> 00:14:06,303
Clear.

81
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:14,937
Money's safe.
Let's take her down.

82
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:26,574
- Roll 92 degrees, port yaw.
- Prime the port.

83
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:58,522
I'm not getting anything.

84
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:07,281
Turbulence.

85
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:18,542
Locked and floating.
You can drop us any time now.

86
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:23,589
Initial damping's going off.
Hold on, there'll be a little bump.

87
00:15:30,055 --> 00:15:32,389
What the hell was that?

88
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:34,975
Pressure drop. Must have lost a shield.

89
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:36,810
Let's go with it.

90
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:40,481
I'm still not getting anything.

91
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:48,864
Dropping off now.

92
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:51,075
Still dropping.

93
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:54,703
There we are, we've got it.

94
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:56,914
Take her down.

95
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:05,714
Navigation lights on.

96
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:42,918
9, 8, 7...

97
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:48,632
6, 5, 4, 3, 2,

98
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,634
1 .

99
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:52,845
Kill drive engines.

100
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:14,992
What the hell happened?

101
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,203
Give me an answer.

102
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:22,332
- Is the hull breached?
- I don't see anything. We still have pressure.

103
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,086
- Push the screen.
- Why?

104
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:39,016
Secondary load-sharing unit is out.

105
00:17:39,184 --> 00:17:42,102
Three of the four cells are gone.

106
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:47,691
- Is that it?
- No, hold on.

107
00:17:47,859 --> 00:17:53,238
We can't fix it out here anyway
and we need to reroute a couple of ducts.

108
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:54,698
Dry-dock time.

109
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:56,992
Tell him to dry-dock.

110
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:01,288
We can't fix it out here.
We've gotta reroute all these ducts.

111
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:03,874
To do that, we've got to dry-dock.

112
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:05,959
What else?

113
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:10,547
Some fragments caked up. We've got
to clean it out and depressurize it.

114
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:13,258
How long before we're functional?

115
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:16,762
- Look...
- 1 7 hours, tell her.

116
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:20,599
At least 25 hours.

117
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:23,060
Get started. I'll be right down.

118
00:18:23,228 --> 00:18:26,730
- Why's she coming down here?
- She better stay the fuck out of my way.

119
00:18:26,898 --> 00:18:29,483
I'd like to see what she's gonna do
when she gets here.

120
00:18:39,911 --> 00:18:41,954
Any response yet?

121
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:47,251
Absolutely nothing, except
the same transmission every 12 seconds.

122
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:50,170
All the other channels are dead.

123
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:57,261
Kick on the floods.

124
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:14,528
We can't go anywhere in this.

125
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:18,157
Mother says the sun rises in 20 minutes.

126
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:24,246
- How far to the source of transmission?
- Northeast. Just under 2,000 meters.

127
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:26,707
Walking distance?

128
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:32,588
- Can you give me an atmospheric?
- Yes.

129
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:41,054
It's almost primordial.

130
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:46,560
Inert nitrogen, high concentration
of carbon dioxide crystals, methane...

131
00:19:46,728 --> 00:19:49,730
- I'm working on the trace elements.
- Anything else?

132
00:19:49,898 --> 00:19:53,817
There's rock, lava base.

133
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:59,156
Deep cold, well below the line.

134
00:20:00,575 --> 00:20:03,327
I'll volunteer to be in the first group
to go out.

135
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:06,121
That figures.

136
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:10,334
- You, too, Lambert.
- Swell.

137
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:14,254
You'd better break out the weapons.

138
00:21:27,245 --> 00:21:33,166
- I can't see a goddamn thing.
- Ash, are you receiving?

139
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:40,340
Good contact on my board.

140
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:44,636
Clear and free. Keep the line open.
Let's go.

141
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:01,903
Hey, Ripley.

142
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:05,657
I want to ask you a question.

143
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:09,119
If they find what they're after,
do we get full shares?

144
00:22:09,287 --> 00:22:13,415
Don't worry,
you'll get whatever's coming to you.

145
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:17,627
I'm not doing any more work
until we get this straightened out.

146
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:22,049
Brett, you're guaranteed by law
to get a share.

147
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:25,052
- What?
- Why don't you just fuck off?

148
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:28,638
- What?
- What did you say?

149
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:33,185
If you have any trouble,
I'll be on the bridge.

150
00:22:33,353 --> 00:22:36,438
Come back here.

151
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:45,030
- Son of a bitch.
- What's the matter?

152
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:56,458
Can't see a goddamn thing.

153
00:22:56,626 --> 00:22:58,627
Quit griping.

154
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:01,463
- I like griping.
- Knock it off.

155
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,936
How's it going?

156
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:21,316
- All right.
- You put that transmission through ECIU?

157
00:23:21,484 --> 00:23:24,402
No. Mother hasn't identified it yet.

158
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:27,989
- Mind if I give it a shot?
- Please do.

159
00:24:44,275 --> 00:24:47,903
- Ash, can you see this?
- I can.

160
00:24:51,032 --> 00:24:53,909
I've never seen anything like it.

161
00:25:01,918 --> 00:25:04,294
It's very bizarre.

162
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,477
All right.

163
00:25:20,645 --> 00:25:23,688
Moving on to second position.

164
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:25,899
What is it?

165
00:25:28,152 --> 00:25:30,111
Let's get outta here.

166
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:33,782
We've got this far. We have to go on.

167
00:25:37,912 --> 00:25:40,413
Will you say that again?

168
00:25:40,581 --> 00:25:41,581
Shit.

169
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:46,920
As you can see, it's hard to describe.

170
00:25:47,088 --> 00:25:49,673
I'm going back to the console.

171
00:26:42,685 --> 00:26:44,060
Dallas?

172
00:27:43,537 --> 00:27:46,998
Come on down here.
There's something different.

173
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:53,129
I don't know what it is, but if we can
get up that wall, we can find out.

174
00:29:04,452 --> 00:29:07,787
Alien life form.

175
00:29:07,955 --> 00:29:10,957
It looks like it's been dead a long time.

176
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:13,626
Fossilised.

177
00:29:13,794 --> 00:29:17,088
Looks like it's grown out of the chair.

178
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,898
Bones are bent outward.

179
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:38,067
Like he exploded from inside.

180
00:29:42,573 --> 00:29:46,201
Wonder what happened
to the rest of the crew.

181
00:29:50,206 --> 00:29:52,916
Let's get the hell outta here.

182
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:05,720
Hey, Dallas.

183
00:30:05,888 --> 00:30:09,057
Lambert, come on over here.

184
00:30:10,059 --> 00:30:11,726
Come on.

185
00:30:19,944 --> 00:30:23,905
- What have you got?
- See what you make of this.

186
00:30:31,372 --> 00:30:35,542
Ash, that transmission.
Mother's deciphered part of it.

187
00:30:35,709 --> 00:30:38,461
- It doesn't look like an SOS.
- What is it, then?

188
00:30:38,629 --> 00:30:41,881
It looks like a warning.

189
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:46,094
- I'm gonna go out after them.
- What's the point?

190
00:30:47,555 --> 00:30:53,309
By the time it takes to get there,
they'll know if it's a warning or not.

191
00:31:20,421 --> 00:31:23,131
Are you OK down there?

192
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:32,765
- Can you see anything?
- A cave of some sort, but I...

193
00:31:35,352 --> 00:31:38,730
It's like the goddamn tropics in here.

194
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:43,860
What the hell is this?

195
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:23,524
The pit is completely enclosed.

196
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:29,405
It's full of leathery objects,
like eggs or something.

197
00:32:47,758 --> 00:32:53,680
There's a layer of mist covering the eggs
that reacts when broken.

198
00:32:57,518 --> 00:33:00,395
Kane? Are you all right?

199
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:02,647
I'm OK.

200
00:33:05,442 --> 00:33:07,819
I'm OK. I just slipped.

201
00:33:27,881 --> 00:33:31,008
It appears to be completely sealed.

202
00:33:56,243 --> 00:33:59,871
Wait, there's movement.

203
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:03,708
It seems to have organic life.

204
00:35:08,774 --> 00:35:11,234
- Are you there, Ripley?
- I'm here.

205
00:35:17,533 --> 00:35:20,827
- I'm at the inner lock hatch.
- Right.

206
00:35:30,504 --> 00:35:33,339
Are you there?
We're clean, let us in.

207
00:35:33,507 --> 00:35:37,176
- What happened to Kane?
- Something attached itself to him.

208
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:39,846
What kind of thing?

209
00:35:40,013 --> 00:35:42,181
An organism. Open the hatch.

210
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:46,686
If we let it in, the ship could be infected.
You know the quarantine procedure.

211
00:35:46,854 --> 00:35:50,523
- 24 hours for decontamination.
- He could die. Open the hatch.

212
00:35:50,691 --> 00:35:53,484
If we break quarantine, we could all die.

213
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:57,989
Can you open the goddamn hatch?
We have to get him inside.

214
00:35:59,533 --> 00:36:01,450
No, I can't do that.

215
00:36:01,618 --> 00:36:03,369
If you were in my position
you'd do the same.

216
00:36:03,537 --> 00:36:06,455
This is an order.
Open that hatch, do you hear me?

217
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:07,915
Yes.

218
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:12,837
- This is an order! Do you hear me?
- I read you. The answer is negative.

219
00:36:16,383 --> 00:36:18,801
Inner hatch open.

220
00:36:45,746 --> 00:36:47,455
My God.

221
00:36:57,925 --> 00:37:00,092
What the hell is that?

222
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:03,763
How is he?

223
00:37:06,516 --> 00:37:09,352
How are we gonna get that off him?

224
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:14,190
- How do we get it off?
- Just a minute. I'll get some instruments.

225
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:25,034
Right. If I make an incision here

226
00:37:25,202 --> 00:37:28,496
to try and remove
one of the digits from his face...

227
00:37:28,664 --> 00:37:30,539
You're gonna do what?

228
00:37:30,707 --> 00:37:33,709
Finger. I'll try and get this finger off.

229
00:37:33,877 --> 00:37:36,629
Get this cleating on there...

230
00:37:39,633 --> 00:37:42,635
- It's tearing his scalp.
- I know.

231
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,639
It's not coming off
without tearing his face off with it.

232
00:37:47,641 --> 00:37:50,101
We'll have to take a look at him inside.

233
00:37:52,354 --> 00:37:55,231
How come they don't freeze him?

234
00:37:55,399 --> 00:37:58,359
How come you guys don't freeze him?

235
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,627
You can take your mask off.

236
00:38:34,855 --> 00:38:40,359
- What's it got down his throat?
- I suggest it's feeding him oxygen.

237
00:38:40,527 --> 00:38:45,364
Paralyses him, puts him in a coma,
then keeps him alive.

238
00:38:45,532 --> 00:38:48,325
What the hell is that?

239
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:52,121
- We've got to get it off him.
- Just a minute.

240
00:38:52,289 --> 00:38:54,790
Let's not be too hasty.

241
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:58,753
We don't know anything about it.

242
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:05,426
We're assuming it's feeding him oxygen.
If we remove it, it could kill him.

243
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:10,556
I'll take that chance.
Let's cut it off him now.

244
00:39:10,724 --> 00:39:14,226
- You take responsibility?
- Yes. Get him out of there.

245
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:18,272
Where do you want to do this?

246
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:21,442
We'll make an incision
just below the knuckle.

247
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:23,694
Right here?

248
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:34,246
Good God.

249
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:40,753
That crap's gonna eat through the hull.

250
00:39:42,255 --> 00:39:46,008
I think it's going to eat through
the goddamn hull. Come on.

251
00:39:47,761 --> 00:39:49,845
This way.

252
00:39:57,771 --> 00:39:59,939
Next deck.

253
00:40:17,249 --> 00:40:19,333
There it is.

254
00:40:20,961 --> 00:40:23,003
Don't get under it.

255
00:40:28,677 --> 00:40:30,886
Looks like it's stopping.

256
00:40:33,807 --> 00:40:35,641
Take a look at this.

257
00:40:35,809 --> 00:40:39,186
Brett, give me your pen, quick.

258
00:40:39,354 --> 00:40:41,397
Come on.

259
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:49,196
Don't get any on your arm.

260
00:40:55,579 --> 00:40:57,705
It's stopped.

261
00:40:57,873 --> 00:41:01,959
I haven't seen anything like that,
except molecular acid.

262
00:41:02,127 --> 00:41:05,254
It must be using it for blood.

263
00:41:05,422 --> 00:41:09,300
It's got a wonderful defence mechanism.
You don't dare kill it.

264
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,510
What about Kane?

265
00:41:13,513 --> 00:41:15,723
Here's your pen back.

266
00:41:15,891 --> 00:41:20,519
- What do we do now?
- Leave Kane to Ash. You get back to work.

267
00:41:33,116 --> 00:41:34,241
Okay.

268
00:41:35,577 --> 00:41:37,703
Try it.

269
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:46,462
- Damn it. I felt sure that was it.
- Try it again.

270
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:51,884
Feel like I've been in this place a month.

271
00:41:52,052 --> 00:41:56,013
We shouldn't have landed here
in the first place.

272
00:41:56,181 --> 00:42:00,434
Shouldn't have landed
on this damn ball, I know that.

273
00:42:00,602 --> 00:42:04,772
The sooner we patch this up,
the sooner we can go home.

274
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:06,857
This place gives me the creeps.

275
00:43:10,422 --> 00:43:13,048
It's amazing. What is it?

276
00:43:14,551 --> 00:43:16,635
I'd say it's...

277
00:43:17,971 --> 00:43:20,222
I don't know yet.

278
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:27,521
- Do you want something?
- Yes, I...

279
00:43:29,983 --> 00:43:32,818
A little talk. How's Kane?

280
00:43:32,986 --> 00:43:35,362
He's holding. No changes.

281
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:38,532
And our guest?

282
00:43:43,246 --> 00:43:46,623
As I said, I'm still collating.

283
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:52,254
But I have confirmed that he's got
an outer layer of protein polysaccharides.

284
00:43:52,422 --> 00:43:58,969
He has a funny habit of shedding his cells
and replacing them with polarized silicone,

285
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:05,142
which gives him a prolonged resistance
to adverse environmental conditions.

286
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:07,227
Is that enough?

287
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:09,605
Plenty. What does it mean?

288
00:44:09,773 --> 00:44:14,151
- Please don't do that. Thank you.
- I'm sorry.

289
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:20,699
It's an interesting combination of elements,
making him a tough little son of a bitch.

290
00:44:20,867 --> 00:44:23,160
And you let him in.

291
00:44:23,328 --> 00:44:25,704
I was obeying a direct order.

292
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:32,044
When Dallas and Kane are off the ship,
I'm senior officer.

293
00:44:32,212 --> 00:44:34,254
Oh, yes. I forgot.

294
00:44:35,131 --> 00:44:39,218
You also forgot the Science Division's
basic quarantine law.

295
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:43,597
- That I didn't forget.
- I see. You just broke it.

296
00:44:43,765 --> 00:44:47,184
What would you have done with Kane?

297
00:44:47,352 --> 00:44:50,604
You knew his only chance
was to get him in here.

298
00:44:50,772 --> 00:44:55,025
Unfortunately, by breaking quarantine,
you risk everybody's life.

299
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:57,611
Maybe I should have left him outside.

300
00:44:57,779 --> 00:45:02,199
Maybe I've jeopardized the rest of us,
but it was a risk I was willing to take.

301
00:45:02,367 --> 00:45:06,245
It's a pretty big risk for a science officer.

302
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:10,040
It's not exactly out of the manual.

303
00:45:11,334 --> 00:45:14,837
I take my responsibilities
as seriously as you.

304
00:45:16,089 --> 00:45:19,925
You do your job
and let me do mine.

305
00:45:56,504 --> 00:45:58,797
- Where's Dallas?
- In the shuttle.

306
00:46:04,804 --> 00:46:05,804
Dallas.

307
00:46:05,972 --> 00:46:08,140
You should have a look at Kane.

308
00:46:08,308 --> 00:46:11,476
- Why?
- Something's happened.

309
00:46:11,644 --> 00:46:14,479
- Serious?
- Interesting.

310
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:23,322
Ripley, meet me in the infirmary right away.

311
00:46:26,034 --> 00:46:29,244
- Where is it?
- I don't know.

312
00:46:29,412 --> 00:46:33,999
- We have to try and find it.
- Let's check it.

313
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:01,526
Please be careful.

314
00:47:42,277 --> 00:47:44,569
Sorry.

315
00:48:16,853 --> 00:48:19,938
Not in the corner.

316
00:48:20,106 --> 00:48:24,109
Have one of these. Just in case.

317
00:48:36,539 --> 00:48:38,915
Kane? Dallas?

318
00:48:44,005 --> 00:48:45,630
Are you OK?

319
00:48:45,798 --> 00:48:50,052
- I didn't see it. Was it in the overhead?
- It was up there somewhere.

320
00:48:50,219 --> 00:48:54,389
- My God.
- Cover the damn thing, will you?

321
00:48:54,557 --> 00:48:59,102
- It's alive.
- That's a reflex action.

322
00:49:00,897 --> 00:49:02,856
We've got to have a look at this.

323
00:49:15,495 --> 00:49:17,621
Excuse me.

324
00:49:23,211 --> 00:49:27,839
- It seems dead enough.
- Good. Let's get rid of it.

325
00:49:28,007 --> 00:49:33,804
For God's sake, this is the first time
we've encountered a species like this.

326
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:36,807
It has to go back,
tests have to be made...

327
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:41,770
Are you kidding? This thing bled acid.
Who knows what it will do when it's dead?

328
00:49:41,938 --> 00:49:45,023
I think it's safe to assume it isn't a zombie.

329
00:49:45,191 --> 00:49:47,901
Dallas, it has to go back.

330
00:49:48,069 --> 00:49:53,240
I'd soon as not burn it at the stake,
but you're the science officer.

331
00:49:53,408 --> 00:49:55,742
- It's your decision.
- Dallas.

332
00:49:56,202 --> 00:50:00,080
- You won't make me change my mind...
- I'm not trying to change your mind.

333
00:50:00,248 --> 00:50:02,874
I just want you to listen...

334
00:50:04,919 --> 00:50:09,047
- How can you leave that decision to him?
- I just run the ship.

335
00:50:09,215 --> 00:50:12,050
Anything scientific, Ash has the final word.

336
00:50:12,218 --> 00:50:15,429
- How does that happen?
- That's what the company wants.

337
00:50:15,596 --> 00:50:20,934
- Since when is that standard procedure?
- Standard procedure is to do what they say.

338
00:50:21,894 --> 00:50:26,565
- Did you ever ship out with Ash before?
- I went out five times with another officer.

339
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:30,819
They replaced him two days before
we left Thedus with Ash.

340
00:50:30,987 --> 00:50:35,365
- I don't trust him.
- I don't trust anybody.

341
00:50:35,533 --> 00:50:39,244
- How are the repairs going?
- They're pretty much finished.

342
00:50:39,412 --> 00:50:42,205
- Why didn't you tell me?
- There's still some things to do.

343
00:50:42,373 --> 00:50:44,040
Like what?

344
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:48,128
We're blind on B and C decks,
the reserve power system's blown...

345
00:50:48,296 --> 00:50:50,922
That's horseshit.
We can take off without that.

346
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:55,385
- You think that's a good idea?
- I just wanna get the hell outta here.

347
00:51:19,744 --> 00:51:22,287
Dust in the intakes.
Number two's overheating.

348
00:51:22,455 --> 00:51:24,789
Spit on it for two minutes!

349
00:51:25,666 --> 00:51:29,628
We're hot and we're getting hotter.

350
00:51:31,464 --> 00:51:34,174
Engine room, red clip status.

351
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:39,012
- One kilometer on ascension.
- Engage artificial gravity.

352
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:42,724
- Engaged.
- I'm altering the vector now.

353
00:51:47,021 --> 00:51:49,105
Inhibit CNG.

354
00:51:52,151 --> 00:51:56,029
- Struts retract.
- Struts retracted.

355
00:52:18,386 --> 00:52:19,928
Walk in the park.

356
00:52:20,096 --> 00:52:23,181
When we fix something,
it stays fixed, eh, Brett?

357
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:24,391
Right.

358
00:52:39,907 --> 00:52:44,119
We should freeze him. If he's got a disease,
why don't we stop it there?

359
00:52:44,287 --> 00:52:47,372
- We can get to a doctor back home.
- Right.

360
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:51,668
Whenever he says anything,
you say "Right". You know that?

361
00:52:51,836 --> 00:52:53,503
Right.

362
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:57,966
Your staff just follows you around
and says "Right"! Like a parrot.

363
00:52:58,134 --> 00:53:01,595
- Shape up. What are you, a parrot?
- Right.

364
00:53:01,762 --> 00:53:03,888
Knock it off.

365
00:53:04,056 --> 00:53:08,018
- Kane will have to go into quarantine.
- And so are we.

366
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:12,689
- How about something to lower your spirits?
- Thrill me, will you?

367
00:53:12,857 --> 00:53:16,901
According to my calculations,
based on time spent...

368
00:53:17,069 --> 00:53:20,155
- The short version. How far to Earth?
- Ten months.

369
00:53:20,323 --> 00:53:22,365
- Oh, God.
- Right.

370
00:53:23,409 --> 00:53:24,451
Yes?

371
00:53:24,619 --> 00:53:28,121
- I think you should see Kane.
- Has his condition changed?

372
00:53:28,289 --> 00:53:30,582
- It's simpler if you come.
- We're on our way.

373
00:53:33,336 --> 00:53:35,420
Right.

374
00:53:38,382 --> 00:53:40,884
How are you feelin'?

375
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:48,058
- How are you doing?
- Terrific. Next silly question?

376
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,605
Thank you.

377
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:59,402
Do you remember anything
about the planet?

378
00:54:01,072 --> 00:54:04,407
What's the last thing you do remember?

379
00:54:10,581 --> 00:54:15,293
I remember some horrible dream
about smothering and...

380
00:54:17,922 --> 00:54:19,714
Anyway, where are we?

381
00:54:19,882 --> 00:54:22,133
- Right here.
- We're on our way home.

382
00:54:22,301 --> 00:54:25,428
Back to the old freezerinos.

383
00:54:26,514 --> 00:54:30,642
- I've got to have something to eat first.
- I need something myself.

384
00:54:31,435 --> 00:54:34,312
One more meal before bedtime. I'm buying.

385
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,689
That's a break.

386
00:54:57,211 --> 00:55:01,756
First thing I'm going to do when I get back
is to get some decent food.

387
00:55:01,924 --> 00:55:07,429
I can dig it. I've eaten worse food than this,
but then I've tasted better.

388
00:55:07,596 --> 00:55:10,598
You pound down the stuff
like there's no tomorrow.

389
00:55:10,766 --> 00:55:15,228
I'd rather be eating something else,
but right now I'm thinking food.

390
00:55:15,396 --> 00:55:19,023
You should know,
you know what it's made of.

391
00:55:19,191 --> 00:55:23,236
I don't wanna talk about what it's made of.
I'm eating this.

392
00:55:24,613 --> 00:55:28,867
What's the matter?
The food ain't that bad.

393
00:55:29,994 --> 00:55:32,078
What's wrong?

394
00:55:34,623 --> 00:55:36,749
What? What?

395
00:55:36,917 --> 00:55:38,960
This is serious.

396
00:55:48,846 --> 00:55:51,097
Get the spoon.

397
00:55:53,434 --> 00:55:56,352
- Get it into his mouth.
- I'm trying.

398
00:56:25,674 --> 00:56:27,759
Oh, God!

399
00:56:35,893 --> 00:56:37,936
Don't touch it. Don't touch it.

400
00:56:56,789 --> 00:56:59,249
- Dallas?
- Yeah.

401
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:03,127
- Anything?
- No. You?

402
00:57:03,295 --> 00:57:05,338
Nothing.

403
00:57:05,506 --> 00:57:08,007
- Did you see anything?
- No.

404
00:57:43,127 --> 00:57:45,628
Inner hatch sealed.

405
00:57:48,674 --> 00:57:51,175
Anybody want to say anything?

406
00:58:27,046 --> 00:58:30,715
This is just an ordinary prod,
like a cattle prod.

407
00:58:30,883 --> 00:58:35,595
It's got a portable battery.
It's insulated from here to here.

408
00:58:35,763 --> 00:58:39,724
Just make damn sure
nobody puts their hand on the end of it.

409
00:58:42,269 --> 00:58:46,564
It shouldn't damage the bastard
unless its skin is thinner than ours.

410
00:58:46,732 --> 00:58:50,652
But it will give him a little incentive.

411
00:58:50,819 --> 00:58:52,904
Now we just have to find him.

412
00:58:53,072 --> 00:58:59,911
I've designed this tracking device.
You just set it to search for a moving object.

413
00:59:01,455 --> 00:59:05,958
Hasn't got much range, but within
a certain distance, it gives off a signal.

414
00:59:06,126 --> 00:59:09,128
What does it key on?

415
00:59:09,296 --> 00:59:13,091
Micro changes in air density.

416
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:15,468
Gimme a demo.

417
00:59:17,763 --> 00:59:20,765
See? And again...

418
00:59:20,933 --> 00:59:23,142
Gotcha.

419
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:28,940
Two teams. Ash, Lambert and I.
Ripley, you take Parker and Brett.

420
00:59:30,776 --> 00:59:35,071
Anyone see this thing, you catch it
in the net that Parker is holding.

421
00:59:35,239 --> 00:59:37,990
Parker, I don't want any heroics
out of you, all right?

422
00:59:38,158 --> 00:59:41,202
Catch it, put it in the airlock, get rid of it.

423
00:59:41,370 --> 00:59:47,792
The channels are open on all decks.
I want you to keep in touch at all times.

424
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:50,002
Let's go.

425
01:00:03,517 --> 01:00:06,102
I thought you fixed 12 module.

426
01:00:06,270 --> 01:00:09,981
We did. I don't understand it.

427
01:00:12,484 --> 01:00:15,486
The circuits must have burned out.

428
01:00:27,207 --> 01:00:30,585
- What have we got here?
- Hold your light over here.

429
01:00:30,752 --> 01:00:32,753
That's it.

430
01:00:32,921 --> 01:00:36,007
I don't know if this will work.

431
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:40,845
- Put this in there.
- Right.

432
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:47,727
Check the insulation.

433
01:00:47,895 --> 01:00:49,937
Shit...

434
01:01:12,044 --> 01:01:14,962
According to this, it's within five meters.

435
01:01:23,472 --> 01:01:26,891
Micro changes in air density, my ass.

436
01:01:31,647 --> 01:01:33,940
It's within five meters.

437
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:36,108
Be careful.

438
01:02:05,264 --> 01:02:10,768
- Don't creep up on me with that thing.
- You guys stick together.

439
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:29,495
What?

440
01:02:29,663 --> 01:02:31,831
It's in this locker.

441
01:02:31,999 --> 01:02:33,624
In where?

442
01:02:33,792 --> 01:02:35,835
Here, take it.

443
01:02:38,130 --> 01:02:40,172
I got it.

444
01:02:42,843 --> 01:02:44,260
Wait.

445
01:02:45,053 --> 01:02:47,638
All right, when I say.

446
01:02:50,809 --> 01:02:53,811
- All right. Now.
- Easy.

447
01:02:59,484 --> 01:03:02,903
- Don't let him go!
- What the hell are you doing?

448
01:03:03,071 --> 01:03:05,156
It's the cat.

449
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:16,000
We had to bag it. Now we might
pick it up on the tracker again.

450
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:20,963
Go and get it, man.

451
01:03:21,131 --> 01:03:24,508
You get him, we'll go on.

452
01:03:34,436 --> 01:03:36,854
Here, kitty.

453
01:03:37,022 --> 01:03:38,689
Here, kitty, kitty.

454
01:03:40,317 --> 01:03:43,027
Kitty crap. Jones?

455
01:03:46,198 --> 01:03:48,074
Jonesy?

456
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:50,034
Here, Jonesy.

457
01:03:57,876 --> 01:03:59,251
Jonesy?

458
01:04:05,050 --> 01:04:07,426
Here, kitty.

459
01:04:13,934 --> 01:04:15,559
Here, Jonesy.

460
01:04:27,739 --> 01:04:29,323
Jonesy.

461
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:42,962
Here, kitty, kitty.

462
01:06:10,842 --> 01:06:12,259
Kitty, kitty, kitty.

463
01:06:14,763 --> 01:06:16,388
Here, Jonesy.

464
01:06:17,349 --> 01:06:18,974
Jonesy.

465
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:22,853
Kitty, kitty.

466
01:07:12,404 --> 01:07:13,946
Jonesy?

467
01:07:22,539 --> 01:07:26,584
Come on, Jonesy.
Come on, baby. That's a kitty.

468
01:07:26,751 --> 01:07:28,836
Come on, baby.

469
01:07:30,130 --> 01:07:32,047
That's a kitty.

470
01:07:33,758 --> 01:07:36,927
I'm not gonna hurt you. Come on.

471
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:17,718
Whatever it was, it was big.

472
01:08:20,805 --> 01:08:22,431
You sure it took him into the air shaft?

473
01:08:22,599 --> 01:08:25,184
Disappeared into one of the cooling ducts.

474
01:08:25,352 --> 01:08:29,355
No question.
It's using the air ducts to move around.

475
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:34,610
Could he want Brett alive?

476
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:37,988
- What?
- Could Brett be alive?

477
01:08:38,156 --> 01:08:41,241
No. I mean, l don't think so.

478
01:08:41,409 --> 01:08:44,912
This air shaft may work to our advantage.

479
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:52,211
It comes out in the main airlock.
There's only one big opening along the way.

480
01:08:52,379 --> 01:08:58,509
We can cover that up and then we drive it
into the airlock and zap it into outer space.

481
01:08:58,677 --> 01:09:01,011
The son of a bitch is huge.

482
01:09:01,179 --> 01:09:03,430
It's like a man. It's big.

483
01:09:03,598 --> 01:09:05,474
Kane's son.

484
01:09:06,851 --> 01:09:11,438
Come on, Ash. The science department
should be able to help. How can we drive it?

485
01:09:11,606 --> 01:09:15,693
It's adapted well to our atmosphere,
considering its nutritional needs.

486
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:17,861
But we don't know about temperature.

487
01:09:18,029 --> 01:09:21,552
- OK, temperature. What if we change it?
- Let's try it.

488
01:09:21,629 --> 01:09:24,952
Most animals retreat from fire.

489
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:29,873
Fire, yeah. Parker, can you rig
three or four incinerator units?

490
01:09:30,917 --> 01:09:33,502
Give me 20 minutes, I'll do it.

491
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:35,921
- Who gets to go into the vent?
- I do.

492
01:09:36,881 --> 01:09:38,632
No.

493
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:43,303
You and Ash, take the main airlock.

494
01:09:43,471 --> 01:09:48,100
Parker, Lambert, you cover up
that maintenance opening.

495
01:11:26,407 --> 01:11:30,077
- I'm at the first junction.
- I'm right here.

496
01:11:30,245 --> 01:11:32,329
- Parker?
- Yeah.

497
01:11:32,497 --> 01:11:36,333
- Lambert?
- In position. I'm trying to get a reading.

498
01:11:36,501 --> 01:11:39,169
- The airlock is open.
- Okay, Ripley.

499
01:11:39,337 --> 01:11:40,963
Ready.

500
01:11:51,349 --> 01:11:54,101
I've got a reading on you now.

501
01:12:31,097 --> 01:12:33,932
Open the hatch to the third junction.

502
01:12:50,867 --> 01:12:52,451
OK, I'm through.

503
01:12:52,619 --> 01:12:54,203
- Ripley?
- Yes.

504
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:57,247
Close all the hatches behind me.

505
01:12:57,415 --> 01:12:59,458
I'm moving on.

506
01:13:14,098 --> 01:13:16,850
Dallas, hold on. I think I got it.

507
01:13:17,018 --> 01:13:20,187
- Yes, I've got it.
- Where?

508
01:13:21,689 --> 01:13:24,650
It's somewhere around the third junction.

509
01:13:24,817 --> 01:13:27,277
OK. Moving on.

510
01:13:46,631 --> 01:13:51,051
It is right around there.
You'll have to be careful.

511
01:14:00,603 --> 01:14:08,068
All right. I've reached the third junction
and I'm going down.

512
01:14:26,587 --> 01:14:29,756
What the hell's the matter with that box?

513
01:14:30,508 --> 01:14:34,052
Dallas, hold your position for a minute.

514
01:14:35,013 --> 01:14:37,764
- I've lost the signal!
- What?

515
01:14:37,932 --> 01:14:39,099
You sure?

516
01:14:39,267 --> 01:14:44,354
Are you sure it's not there?
It's got to be around there.

517
01:14:47,525 --> 01:14:51,361
Check that out.
You may be getting interference.

518
01:14:51,529 --> 01:14:54,614
Are you sure there's no sign of it?
It is there.

519
01:14:56,534 --> 01:14:58,910
It's gotta be around there.

520
01:14:59,829 --> 01:15:01,288
Dallas?

521
01:15:05,710 --> 01:15:07,753
All right.

522
01:15:13,718 --> 01:15:16,261
Am I clear? I wanna get outta here.

523
01:15:17,930 --> 01:15:21,058
Oh, God! It's moving right towards you.

524
01:15:29,233 --> 01:15:33,111
Move, get out of there! Move!

525
01:15:34,405 --> 01:15:37,574
Move, Dallas! Get out!

526
01:15:39,327 --> 01:15:42,245
No, the other way!

527
01:15:44,332 --> 01:15:45,874
Dallas?

528
01:15:46,042 --> 01:15:49,086
- No.
- Take it easy. Dallas?

529
01:15:55,176 --> 01:15:58,095
We found this laying there.

530
01:15:59,055 --> 01:16:00,931
No blood.

531
01:16:01,557 --> 01:16:03,600
No Dallas.

532
01:16:04,602 --> 01:16:06,686
Nothing.

533
01:16:11,109 --> 01:16:15,779
- I don't hear anybody sayin' nothing.
- I'm thinking.

534
01:16:17,448 --> 01:16:23,745
Unless somebody has a better idea,
we'll proceed with Dallas's plan.

535
01:16:23,913 --> 01:16:29,668
What? And end up like the others?
You're out of your mind.

536
01:16:29,836 --> 01:16:34,131
- You got a better idea?
- I say that we abandon the ship.

537
01:16:34,298 --> 01:16:41,179
We get the shuttle and get the hell out
of here, and hope somebody picks us up.

538
01:16:41,347 --> 01:16:45,559
- The shuttle won't take four.
- Then why don't we draw straws?

539
01:16:45,726 --> 01:16:48,687
I'm not drawing any straws.
I'm for killing it now.

540
01:16:48,855 --> 01:16:54,234
OK. Let's talk about killing it.
It's in the air shafts...

541
01:16:54,402 --> 01:16:57,195
Will you listen to me? Shut up!

542
01:16:57,363 --> 01:17:00,824
Let's hear it. Let's hear it.

543
01:17:00,992 --> 01:17:04,494
- It's using the air shafts.
- We don't know that...

544
01:17:04,662 --> 01:17:08,748
That's the only way.
We'll move in pairs.

545
01:17:08,916 --> 01:17:12,502
We'll go step by step
and cut off every bulkhead and vent

546
01:17:12,670 --> 01:17:16,798
until we have it cornered,
then we'll blow it the fuck out into space.

547
01:17:16,966 --> 01:17:19,009
Is that acceptable to you?

548
01:17:19,177 --> 01:17:20,760
If it means killing it, yeah.

549
01:17:20,928 --> 01:17:23,346
Obviously it means killing it.

550
01:17:24,515 --> 01:17:26,349
But we have to stick together.

551
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:32,564
- How are our weapons?
- Fine. This one needs refueling.

552
01:17:32,732 --> 01:17:35,025
Will you get it, please?

553
01:17:35,193 --> 01:17:38,820
- Ash, go with him.
- I can manage.

554
01:17:38,988 --> 01:17:41,031
Don't follow me.

555
01:17:44,368 --> 01:17:45,827
Ash?

556
01:17:47,872 --> 01:17:50,957
Any suggestions from you or Mother?

557
01:17:52,251 --> 01:17:54,669
We're still collating.

558
01:17:55,880 --> 01:18:00,091
You're what? You're still collating?

559
01:18:01,677 --> 01:18:04,429
I find that hard to believe.

560
01:18:05,932 --> 01:18:10,644
- What would you like me to do?
- Just what you've been doing. Nothing.

561
01:18:10,811 --> 01:18:16,733
I've got access to Mother now,
and I'll get my own answers, thank you.

562
01:18:17,818 --> 01:18:19,903
All right.

563
01:20:10,222 --> 01:20:14,100
There is an explanation for this.

564
01:20:14,268 --> 01:20:17,896
I don't wanna hear
your goddamn explanation.

565
01:20:41,587 --> 01:20:44,672
Parker? Lambert?

566
01:20:53,057 --> 01:20:54,099
Ash.

567
01:20:55,017 --> 01:20:56,184
Open the door.

568
01:21:05,736 --> 01:21:07,278
Ash.

569
01:21:11,534 --> 01:21:14,244
Will you open the door?

570
01:21:18,082 --> 01:21:20,125
Let me by.

571
01:22:41,165 --> 01:22:43,666
What the hell are you doing?

572
01:23:00,851 --> 01:23:03,728
Get her up.

573
01:23:17,076 --> 01:23:18,952
It's an android!

574
01:23:33,884 --> 01:23:35,885
Jesus...

575
01:23:38,931 --> 01:23:42,225
It's a robot.
Ash is a goddamn robot.

576
01:23:43,936 --> 01:23:46,062
God.

577
01:23:52,611 --> 01:23:54,571
Holy shit.

578
01:23:55,990 --> 01:23:57,824
Help me get this fucking thing off.

579
01:24:05,499 --> 01:24:07,709
God... Jesus...

580
01:24:07,876 --> 01:24:10,086
Oh, God.

581
01:24:13,757 --> 01:24:16,718
How come the company
sent us a goddamn robot?

582
01:24:16,885 --> 01:24:20,722
They must have wanted the alien
for the weapons division.

583
01:24:20,889 --> 01:24:23,391
He's been protecting it all along.

584
01:24:23,559 --> 01:24:27,979
- Will you plug it in?
- I don't know...

585
01:24:28,147 --> 01:24:31,607
Because he may know how to kill it.

586
01:24:58,260 --> 01:25:00,720
Ash, can you hear me?

587
01:25:03,891 --> 01:25:05,224
Ash!

588
01:25:13,192 --> 01:25:15,693
I can hear you.

589
01:25:19,990 --> 01:25:22,408
What was your special order?

590
01:25:22,576 --> 01:25:25,620
You read it. I thought it was clear.

591
01:25:25,788 --> 01:25:31,501
- What was it?
- Bring back life form, priority one.

592
01:25:31,668 --> 01:25:34,587
All other priorities rescinded.

593
01:25:37,341 --> 01:25:42,011
The damn company.
What about our lives, you son of a bitch?

594
01:25:42,179 --> 01:25:45,973
I repeat, all other priorities are rescinded.

595
01:25:46,141 --> 01:25:50,645
How do we kill it?
There's gotta be a way of killing it.

596
01:25:50,813 --> 01:25:53,940
- How do we do it?
- You can't.

597
01:25:54,858 --> 01:25:56,651
That's bullshit.

598
01:25:56,819 --> 01:26:01,906
You still don't understand
what you're dealing with, do you?

599
01:26:02,074 --> 01:26:04,700
The perfect organism.

600
01:26:07,246 --> 01:26:12,041
Its structural perfection
is matched only by its hostility.

601
01:26:12,209 --> 01:26:14,293
You admire it.

602
01:26:17,423 --> 01:26:20,133
I admire its purity.

603
01:26:23,387 --> 01:26:25,680
A survivor,

604
01:26:27,599 --> 01:26:33,438
unclouded by conscience, remorse,

605
01:26:33,605 --> 01:26:35,940
or delusions of morality.

606
01:26:37,734 --> 01:26:42,029
I've heard enough of this
and I'm asking you to pull the plug.

607
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:44,991
Last word.

608
01:26:47,995 --> 01:26:52,165
I can't lie to you about your chances, but...

609
01:26:55,043 --> 01:26:58,087
you have my sympathies.

610
01:27:00,007 --> 01:27:06,053
We're gonna blow up the ship.
We'll take our chances in the shuttle.

611
01:27:06,221 --> 01:27:08,764
- Blow up the ship.
- Good.

612
01:27:08,932 --> 01:27:10,975
Come on.

613
01:27:37,419 --> 01:27:39,962
When we throw the switches,
how long do we have?

614
01:27:40,130 --> 01:27:42,006
- Ten minutes.
- No bullshit.

615
01:27:42,174 --> 01:27:47,094
Or we won't need no rocket
to fly through space.

616
01:27:47,262 --> 01:27:51,265
We'll need coolant
for the air support system.

617
01:28:02,528 --> 01:28:07,281
You two get all the coolant you can carry.
I'll get the shuttle ready.

618
01:28:07,449 --> 01:28:10,660
I'll give you about seven minutes.

619
01:28:10,827 --> 01:28:17,041
Come back up here, I'll shut the switches off
and we'll blow this fucker off into space.

620
01:28:17,209 --> 01:28:18,960
- Ready?
- Take care of yourself.

621
01:28:19,127 --> 01:28:21,379
Seven minutes.

622
01:28:58,375 --> 01:29:00,501
Take it easy.

623
01:29:04,673 --> 01:29:55,181
Jones?

624
01:30:29,341 --> 01:30:31,384
Okay, check the bottles.

625
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:46,482
Jones.

626
01:30:51,446 --> 01:30:53,864
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

627
01:30:56,576 --> 01:30:58,661
OK, go ahead.

628
01:31:00,038 --> 01:31:01,664
Jones?

629
01:31:07,587 --> 01:31:09,588
Kitty, kitty, kitty.

630
01:31:09,756 --> 01:31:11,924
Come here, Jones.

631
01:31:12,092 --> 01:31:13,509
Jones.

632
01:31:18,432 --> 01:31:21,225
Come here, boy.

633
01:31:22,477 --> 01:31:24,562
Nice kitty.

Get out of the way! It's gonna kill us!

I can't!

645
