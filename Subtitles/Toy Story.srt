1
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,644
All right, everyone!
This... is a stick-up!

2
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:03,354
Don't anybody move!

3
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:06,482
Now, empty that safe!

4
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:11,654
Money, money, money!

5
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:14,031
Stop it! Stop it,
you mean, old potato!

6
00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:17,160
Quiet, Bo Peep,
or your sheep get run over!

7
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:19,370
Help! Baa!
Help us!

8
00:01:19,455 --> 00:01:22,957
Oh, no, not my sheep!
Somebody do something!

9
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:32,425
Reach for the sky!

10
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,719
Oh, no! Sheriff Woody!

11
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:37,221
I'm here to stop you,
One-Eyed Bart.

12
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:39,974
How'd you know it was me?

13
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:41,768
Are you gonna come quietly?

14
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:43,060
You can't touch me, Sheriff!

15
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:46,439
I brought my attack dog
with the built-in force field.

16
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:50,485
Well, I brought my dinosaur
who eats force-field dogs.

17
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:54,697
Yipe, yipe, yipe, yipe!
You're going to jail, Bart!

18
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:57,617
Say goodbye to the wife
and Tater Tots.

19
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:08,503
You saved the day again, Woody.

20
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:11,130
You're my favourite deputy.

21
00:02:11,215 --> 00:02:13,716
You've got a friend in me

22
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:17,720
You've got a friend in me

23
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,597
Come on,
let's wrangle up the cattle.

24
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:22,767
When the road looks rough ahead

25
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:26,687
And you're miles and miles
from your nice, warm bed

26
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:27,980
Round 'em up, cowboy!

27
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:30,858
Just remember
what your old pal said

28
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:33,694
Boy, you've got a friend in me

29
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:34,987
Yee-haw!

30
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:37,949
Yeah, you've got a friend in me

31
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:39,659
Hey, cowboy!

32
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:43,579
Some other folks might be
a little bit smarter than I am

33
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,706
Big and stronger too

34
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:46,874
Come on, Woody.

35
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,042
Maybe

36
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:52,838
But none of them will ever
love you the way I do

37
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:55,758
It's me and you, boy

38
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,218
And as the years go by

39
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:59,095
Whoa! Whoa!

40
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,764
Our friendship will never die

41
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:07,228
You're gonna see
It's our destiny

42
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:10,690
You've got a friend in me

43
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:11,941
All right!

44
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,402
Yeah, you've got a friend in me

45
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:15,903
Score!

46
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,197
You got a friend in me

47
00:03:18,282 --> 00:03:19,323
Wow! Cool!

48
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:22,660
-What do you think?
-Oh, this looks great, Mom!

49
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,036
Okay, birthday boy...

50
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:26,163
We saw that at the store!
I asked you for it!

51
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:28,332
-I hope I have enough places.
-Wow, look at that! That's so...

52
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:30,001
-One, two... Four.
-Oh, my gosh, you got...

53
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:32,795
-Yeah, I think that's gonna be enough.
-Could we leave this up 'til we move?

54
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,797
-Well, sure! We can leave it up.
-Yeah!

55
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,924
Now go get Molly. Your friends
are gonna be here any minute.

56
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:39,844
Okay. It's party? time, Woody.

57
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:43,264
Yee-haw!

58
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:50,938
Howdy, little lady.

59
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:57,278
Somebody's poisoned the water hole.

60
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:58,946
Come on, Molly.

61
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:00,156
Oh, you're getting heavy.

62
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:02,241
See you later, Woody.

63
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:13,377
Pull my string!
The birthday party?'s today?

64
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,380
Okay, everybody,

65
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:17,840
coast is clear!

66
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,558
Ages 3 and up. It's on my box.

67
00:04:27,643 --> 00:04:31,562
Ages 3 and up. I'm not supposed
to be baby-sitting Princess Drool.

68
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,700
Hey, Hamm.

69
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:47,912
-Look, I'm Picasso!
-I don't get it.

70
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:52,541
You uncultured swine! What're
you lookin' at, ya hockey puck?

71
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:59,715
-Hey, Sarge, have you seen Slinky?
-Sir! No, sir!

72
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,718
Okay. Hey, thank you. At ease.

73
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,429
Hey, uh, Slinky?

74
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:08,349
Right here, Woody.
I'm red this time.

75
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,643
-No. Slink...
-Oh, well, all right.

76
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:11,894
You can be red if you want.

77
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:15,064
-Not now, Slink. I got some bad news.
-Bad news?

78
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:19,402
Just gather everyone up
for a staff meeting, and be happy.

79
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:20,486
Got it.

80
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,904
Be happy!

81
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:25,658
Staff meeting, everybody!
Snake, Robot, podium duty.

82
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:27,660
Hey.

83
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:32,581
Hey, Etch. Draw!

84
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,752
Oh! Got me again.

85
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:40,506
Etch, you've been working on that draw.
Fastest knobs in the West.

86
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,592
Got a staff meeting, you guys.
Come on, let's go.

87
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:46,303
Now, where is that... Oh.

88
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:48,931
Hey, who moved my doodle pad
way over here?

89
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:54,562
-How're you doin', Rex?
-Were you scared? Tell me honestly.

90
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:56,522
I was close to being scared
that time.

91
00:05:56,606 --> 00:06:00,192
I'm going for fearsome here,
but I just don't feel it.

92
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:02,570
I think I'm just
coming off as annoying.

93
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:06,198
Oh, hi, Bo. Hi.

94
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:08,868
I wanted to thank you, Woody,
for saving my flock.

95
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:11,704
Oh, hey, it was, uh, nothin'.

96
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:16,083
What do you say I get someone else
to watch the sheep tonight?

97
00:06:16,752 --> 00:06:18,294
Oh, yeah!

98
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:23,716
Remember, I'm just
a couple of blocks away.

99
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,593
-Yodel-ay-hee-hoo!
-Come on, come on.

100
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:26,969
Smaller toys up front.

101
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:30,890
Hey, Woody, come on.

102
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:38,397
Oh, thanks, Mike.

103
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,566
Okay... Whoa, whoa. Step back.

104
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,152
-For crying out loud.
-Thank you.

105
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:47,573
Hello? Check.
That better? Great.

106
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,659
Everybody hear me? Up on the shelf,
can you hear me? Great.

107
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:53,829
Okay. First item today...

108
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:57,249
Oh, yeah.
Has everyone picked a moving buddy?

109
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:59,919
-What?
-Moving buddy? You can't be serious.

110
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:02,213
I didn't know we were
supposed to have one already.

111
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:04,673
Do we have to hold hands?

112
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:07,009
You guys think this is a big joke.

113
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,512
We've only got one week
left before the move.

114
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:12,598
I don't want any toys left behind.
A moving buddy.

115
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:15,226
If you don't have one, get one!

116
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:18,270
All right, next. Oh, yes.

117
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:21,649
Tuesday night's plastic corrosion
awareness meeting

118
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:24,109
was, I think, a big success.

119
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:27,363
And we wanna thank Mr Spell
for putting that on for us.

120
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,074
-Thank you, Mr Spell.
-You're welcome.

121
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:33,577
Okay. Oh, yes.
One minor note here.

122
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:36,288
Andy's birthday party
has been moved to today.

123
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:38,082
Wait a minute here!

124
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:41,293
What do you mean the party?'s today?
His birthday's not 'til next week!

125
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:44,004
What's goin' on down there?
Is his mom losin' her marbles?

126
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:47,800
Well, obviously she wanted to
have the party? before the move.

127
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,635
I'm not worried.
You shouldn't be worried.

128
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,178
Of course Woody ain't worried.

129
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:53,305
He's been Andy's favourite
since kindergarten.

130
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,683
Hey, hey.
Come on, Potato Head.

131
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:59,311
If Woody says it's all right, then,
well, darn it, it's good enough for me.

132
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:01,605
Woody has never
steered us wrong before.

133
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:05,317
Come on, guys. Every Christmas
and birthday we go through this.

134
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:08,404
But what ifAndy gets
another dinosaur, a mean one?

135
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,490
I just don't think I could take
that kind of rejection!

136
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:13,868
Hey, listen,
no one's getting replaced.

137
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:16,871
This is Andy
we're talking about.

138
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:20,040
It doesn't matter
how much we're played with.

139
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:26,338
What matters is that we're here
for Andy when he needs us.

140
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:28,465
That's what we're made for, right?

141
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:32,303
Pardon me. I hate to break up the staff
meeting, but... they're here!

142
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:34,138
Birthday guests at three o'clock!

143
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,348
Stay calm, everyone!

144
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:37,892
Hey!

145
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:40,936
Meeting adjourned.

146
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:43,439
Ho, boy! Will you take a look
at all those presents?

147
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:45,941
I can't see a thing.

148
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:52,156
Yes, sir, we're next month's
garage sale fodder for sure.

149
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,075
-Any dinosaur-shaped ones?
-Oh, for crying out loud.

150
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,287
-They're all in boxes, you idiot.
-They're getting bigger.

151
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,664
Wait, there's a nice
little one over there.

152
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:01,790
Hi!

153
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,962
-Spell, trash can.
-We're doomed!

154
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,797
All right! All right!

155
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:12,551
If I send out the troops,
will you all calm down?

156
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:16,472
-Yes! Yes! We promise!
-Okay! Save your batteries.

157
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,557
Very good, Woody.
That's using the old noodle.

158
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:25,147
Sergeant, establish
a recon post downstairs. Code Red!

159
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,691
-You know what to do.
-Yes, sir!

160
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,611
All right, men.
You heard him. Code Red!

161
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:34,073
Repeat, we are at Code Red.
Recon plan Charlie. Execute!

162
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:36,283
Let's move!
Move, move, move, move!

163
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,303
Yeah!

164
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,516
Okay, come on, kids.

165
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,519
Everyone in the living room.
It's almost time for the presents.

166
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,292
All right, gangway, gangway.

167
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:30,587
And this is how we find out

168
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:32,881
what is in those presents.

169
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:39,596
Okay, who's hungry?

170
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:41,640
Here come the chips!

171
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:44,184
I've got Cool Ranch
and barbecue!

172
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:46,228
What in the world... Oh!

173
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:49,732
I thought I told him
to pick these up.

174
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:52,443
Shouldn't they be there by now?
What's taking them so long?

175
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:55,612
Hey, these guys are professionals.
They're the best.

176
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:58,657
Come on!
They're not lying down on the job.

177
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,837
Go on without me!
Just go!

178
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:14,757
A good soldier never
leaves a man behind.

179
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:34,651
Okay, everybody, come on.

180
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:37,696
Everybody settle down.
Now, kids. Everybody...

181
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:41,533
You sit in a circle. No, Andy.
Andy, you sit in the middle there.

182
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:45,662
Good. And... Which present
are you gonna open first?

183
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,791
-Mine!
-There they are.

184
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,585
Come in, Mother Bird.
This is Alpha Bravo.

185
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,921
-This is it! This is it! Quiet, quiet!
-Come in, Mother Bird.

186
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:57,132
All right, Andy's opening
the first present now.

187
00:11:57,217 --> 00:12:00,052
Mrs Potato Head! Mrs Potato Head!
Mrs Potato Head!

188
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:02,596
Hey, I can dream, can't I?

189
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,182
The bow's coming off.
He's ripping the wrapping paper.

190
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:07,768
It's a... It's...
It's a... a lunch box.

191
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:10,062
-We've got a lunch box here.
-A lunch box?

192
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,939
-Lunch box?
-For lunch.

193
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:14,525
Okay, second present.
It appears to be...

194
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:17,486
-Okay, it's bed sheets.
-Who invited that kid?

195
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,827
Oh! Only one left.

196
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:27,621
-Okay, we're on the last present now.
-Last present!

197
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:30,082
It's a big one. It's a...

198
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,709
-lt's a board game! Repeat, Battleship!
-Whew!

199
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:35,003
Hallelujah!

200
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,964
-Yeah! All right!
-Hey, watch it!

201
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:38,799
Sorry there, old spud head.

202
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:42,636
Mission accomplished. Well done, men.
Pack it up. We're goin' home.

203
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,055
So did I tell ya?
Nothin' to worry about.

204
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:48,559
I knew you were right all along, Woody.
Never doubted ya for a second.

205
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:50,936
Wait a minute. Oh!

206
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:55,107
-What do we have here?
-Wait! Turn that thing back on!

207
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,984
Come in, Mother Bird!
Come in, Mother Bird!

208
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:59,778
Mom has pulled a surprise
present from the closet.

209
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:02,281
Andy's opening it.
He's really excited about this one.

210
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:04,283
-Mom, what is it?
-It's a huge package.

211
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:07,327
Oh, get outta the... One of the kids
is in the way. I can't see.

212
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:10,372
-It's a...
-Wow!

213
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,877
It's a what? What is it?

214
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:17,796
-Oh, no!
-Oh, ya big lizard!

215
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:20,507
-Now we'll never know what it is!
-Way to go, Rex!

216
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:22,551
No, no! Turn 'em around!
Turn 'em around!

217
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,137
He's puttin' 'em in backwa...
Here, you're puttin' 'em in backwards!

218
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:28,348
Plus is positive, minus is negative!
Oh, let me!

219
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,852
Let's go to my room, guys!

220
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:34,771
Red alert! Red alert!
Andy is coming upstairs!

221
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,815
-There!
-Juvenile intrusion!

222
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,692
Repeat, resume
your positions now!

223
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:41,445
Andy's coming! Everybody,
back to your places! Hurry!

224
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,530
Get to your places!
Get to your places!

225
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:45,949
Where's my ear? Who's seen my ear?
Did you see my ear?

226
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:49,077
Out of my way! Here I come!
Here I come!

227
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:03,008
Hey, look, its lasers light up.
Take that, Zurg!

228
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:06,386
Quick, make a space.
This is where the spaceship lands.

229
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:08,639
And he does it like that.
And he does a karate chop action!

230
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:11,642
Come on down, guys!
It's time for games!

231
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:13,769
We've got prizes!

232
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,531
-What is it?
-Can you see it?

233
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:30,953
-What the heck is up there?
-Woody, who's up there with ya?

234
00:14:33,248 --> 00:14:34,206
Woody?

235
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:37,209
-What are you doing under the bed?
-Nothin'. Nothin'.

236
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,920
I'm sure Andy was just
a little excited, that's all.

237
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:42,756
Too much cake and ice cream,
I suppose. It's just a mistake!

238
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,635
Well, that mistake is sitting
in your spot, Woody.

239
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,888
-Have you been replaced?
-What did I tell you earlier?

240
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:51,807
No one is getting replaced.

241
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:55,602
Now, let's all be polite and give
whatever it is up there

242
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:59,356
a nice, big
Andy's-room welcome.

243
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:26,133
Buzz Lightyear to Star Command.

244
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:28,135
Come in, Star Command.

245
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:31,096
Star Command, come in.
Do you read me?

246
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,433
Why don't they answer? My ship!

247
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,522
Blast! This'll take weeks to repair.

248
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:44,151
Buzz Lightyear mission log,
stardate 4-0-7-2.

249
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:47,529
My ship has run off course
en route to sector 1 2.

250
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,115
I've crash-landed
on a strange planet.

251
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,701
The impact must've awoken me
from hypersleep.

252
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,539
Terrain seems a bit unstable.

253
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,709
No readout yet
if the air is breathable.

254
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:03,879
And there seems to be no sign
of intelligent life anywhere.

255
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:04,963
Hello!

256
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:08,300
Whoa! Hey!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

257
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,677
Did I frighten you? Didn't mean to.

258
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:13,180
Sorry. Howdy. My name is Woody.

259
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:17,142
And this is Andy's room.
That's all I wanted to say.

260
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,978
And also, there has been
a bit of a mix-up.

261
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:22,356
This is my spot, see,
the bed here.

262
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,733
Local law enforcement.
It's about time you got here.

263
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,819
I'm Buzz Lightyear, Space Ranger,
Universe Protection Unit.

264
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:30,113
My ship has crash-landed here
by mistake.

265
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:33,992
Yes, it is a mistake because,
you see, the bed here is my spot.

266
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:35,660
I need to repair
my turbo boosters.

267
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:38,872
Do you people still use fossil fuel, or
have you discovered crystallic fusion?

268
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,916
Well, let's see. We got double-A's.

269
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:43,377
Watch yourself!
Halt! Who goes there?

270
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:45,837
Don't shoot!
It's okay. Friends.

271
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:49,674
-Do you know these life-forms?
-Yes! They're Andy's toys.

272
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,135
All right, everyone,
you're clear to come up.

273
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,846
I am Buzz Lightyear.
I come in peace.

274
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:58,266
Oh, I'm so glad
you're not a dinosaur!

275
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,519
Wh-why, thank you!

276
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:03,313
Now, thank you all
for your kind welcome!

277
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:06,149
-Say, what's that button do?
-I'll show you.

278
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,860
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!

279
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,030
Hey, Woody's got something like that.
His is a pull string.

280
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:14,366
-Only it's...
-Only it sounds like a car ran over it.

281
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:18,161
Oh, yeah, but not like this.
This is a quality sound system.

282
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:19,788
Probably all copper wiring, huh?

283
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:23,125
So, where you from?
Singapore? Hong Kong?

284
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:27,462
Well, no. Actually, I'm stationed up
in the Gamma Quadrant of Sector Four.

285
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:30,382
As a member of the elite
Universe Protection Unit

286
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:31,883
of the Space Ranger Corps,

287
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:34,678
I protect the galaxy
from the threat of invasion

288
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:38,849
from the evil Emperor Zurg,
sworn enemy of the Galactic Alliance.

289
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,351
Oh, really?
I'm from Playskool.

290
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,895
And I'm from Mattel.
Well, I'm not really from Mattel.

291
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,522
I'm actually from a smaller company

292
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,774
that was purchased
in a leveraged buyout.

293
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:49,651
You'd think they'd never seen
a new toy before.

294
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,403
Well, sure. Look at him.

295
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:54,281
He's got more gadgets on him
than a Swiss Army knife.

296
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,075
Please be careful.

297
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,743
You don't want to be in the way
when my laser goes off.

298
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:02,289
Hey, a laser! How come
you don't have a laser, Woody?

299
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:05,333
It's not a laser! It's a...
It's a little light bulb that blinks.

300
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:07,085
-What's with him?
-Laser envy.

301
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,420
All right, that's enough!

302
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:11,923
Look, we're all very impressed
with Andy's new toy.

303
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:14,384
-Toy?
-T-O-Y. Toy!

304
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:18,430
Excuse me, I think the word
you're searching for is "Space Ranger."

305
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:22,976
The word I'm searching for I can't say
because there's preschool toys present.

306
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,561
Gettin' kinda tense, aren't ya?

307
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:27,689
Mr Lightyear, now, I'm curious.

308
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,400
What does a Space Ranger
actually do?

309
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:32,527
He's not a Space Ranger!

310
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:36,281
He doesn't fight evil
or, or shoot lasers or fly!

311
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,782
Excuse me.

312
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:42,287
Oh, impressive wingspan!
Very good!

313
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:47,125
Oh, what? What?
These are plastic. He can't fly!

314
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:50,670
They are a terillium-carbonic alloy,
and I can fly.

315
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:54,049
-No, you can't.
-Yes, I can.

316
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,133
-You can't.
-Can.

317
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:56,927
Can't. Can't. Can't!

318
00:18:57,011 --> 00:18:59,471
I tell you, I could fly around
this room with my eyes closed!

319
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:03,683
-Okay, then, Mr Light Beer, prove it.
-All right, then, I will.

320
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:05,727
Stand back, everyone!

321
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:16,154
To infinity and beyond!

322
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:45,183
-Can!
-Whoa!

323
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:48,478
Oh, wow, you flew magnificently!

324
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:52,691
-I found my movin' buddy.
-Thank you. Thank you all. Thank you.

325
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:56,611
That wasn't flying!
That was... falling with style.

326
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:59,864
Man, the dolls must really
go for you. Can you teach me that?

327
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,868
-Golly bob howdy!
-Oh, shut up!

328
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:04,953
You know, in a couple of days,

329
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,372
everything will be just the way
it was. They'll see.

330
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:09,124
They'll see.

331
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,585
I'm still Andy's favourite toy.

332
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:15,964
I was on top of the world
livin' high

333
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,049
It was right in my pocket

334
00:20:20,303 --> 00:20:22,012
I was livin' the life

335
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:25,473
Things were just the way
they should be

336
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:30,020
When from out of the sky
like a bomb

337
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:32,397
Comes some little punk
in a rocket

338
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:38,069
Now all of a sudden some
strange things are happening to me

339
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:40,155
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!

340
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:44,534
Strange

341
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,995
Things are happening to me

342
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,500
Strange

343
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:55,754
Things

344
00:20:55,838 --> 00:21:01,051
Strange things are happening to me

345
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,720
Ain't no doubt about it

346
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:13,146
I had friends
I had lots of friends

347
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:16,691
Now all my friends are gone

348
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:20,028
And I'm doin' the best I can

349
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,946
To carry on

350
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,408
-I had power
-Power

351
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:27,869
-I was respected
-Respected

352
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:30,997
But not any more

353
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:33,792
And I've lost the love of the one

354
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:36,669
Whom I adore

355
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:41,091
Let me tell you 'bout it
Strange

356
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:43,968
Things are happenin' to me

357
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:49,140
Strange

358
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:51,226
Things

359
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:55,313
Strange

360
00:21:55,398 --> 00:21:58,149
Things are happenin' to me

361
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:00,652
Ain't no doubt about it

362
00:22:03,406 --> 00:22:06,950
Strange

363
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:09,494
Things

364
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:13,790
Strange

365
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:15,917
Things

366
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:19,754
Finally!

367
00:22:21,382 --> 00:22:22,799
Hey, who's got my hat?

368
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:25,677
Look, I'm Woody!
Howdy, howdy, howdy!

369
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,888
Gimme that!

370
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:31,641
Say there, Lizard and Stretchy Dog,
let me show you something.

371
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:34,644
It looks as though I've been
accepted into your culture.

372
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:37,647
Your chief, Andy,
inscribed his name on me.

373
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:38,773
Wow!

374
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:40,817
With permanent ink too!

375
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:43,528
Well, I must get back
to repairing my ship.

376
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:49,242
Don't let it get to you, Woody.

377
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:51,703
Let what? I don't...
What do you mean? Who?

378
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:54,873
I know Andy's
excited about Buzz.

379
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:58,334
But you know he'll always have
a special place for you.

380
00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:02,297
-Yeah, like the attic.
-All right, that's it!

381
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,341
Unidirectional bonding strip.

382
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:07,802
Mr Lightyear wants more tape.

383
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:13,600
Listen, Light Snack,
you stay away from Andy.

384
00:23:13,684 --> 00:23:17,437
He's mine, and no one
is taking him away from me.

385
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:19,063
What are you talking about?

386
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:21,691
Where's that bonding strip?

387
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:24,277
And another thing,

388
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:28,573
stop with this spaceman thing!
It's getting on my nerves!

389
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:30,992
Are you saying you wanna lodge
a complaint with Star Command?

390
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:35,038
Okay! Well, so you wanna
do it the hard way, huh?

391
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:39,000
-Don't even think about it, cowboy.
-Oh, yeah, tough guy?

392
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:52,472
The air isn't... toxic.

393
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:56,142
How dare you open a spaceman's
helmet on an uncharted planet!

394
00:23:56,227 --> 00:23:59,562
My eyeballs could've been
sucked from their sockets!

395
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:04,692
You actually think
you're the Buzz Lightyear?

396
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:07,779
Oh, all this time
I thought it was an act!

397
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:11,658
Hey, guys, look!
It's the real Buzz Lightyear!

398
00:24:11,742 --> 00:24:12,992
You're mocking me,
aren't you?

399
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:15,828
Oh, no, no. No, no, no, no, no.
Buzz, look, an alien!

400
00:24:15,913 --> 00:24:17,330
Where?

401
00:24:25,047 --> 00:24:26,589
Yes!

402
00:24:30,094 --> 00:24:31,135
It's Sid!

403
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,971
Don't move!

404
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:34,722
I thought he was at summer camp.

405
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:36,891
They must've kicked him out
early this year.

406
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:39,227
Oh, no, not Sid!

407
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:40,895
Incoming!

408
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:46,067
-Who is it this time?
-I... I can't... I can't tell.

409
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,319
-Hey, where's Lenny?
-Right here, Woody.

410
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:52,240
Oh, no, I can't bear to watch
one of these again.

411
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:55,493
Oh, no, it's a Combat Carl.

412
00:24:55,578 --> 00:24:56,536
What's going on?

413
00:24:56,620 --> 00:25:00,331
Nothing that concerns you spacemen,
just us toys.

414
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,916
I'd better take a look anyway.

415
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:05,503
Why is that soldier
strapped to an explosive device?

416
00:25:05,588 --> 00:25:07,839
That's why, Sid.

417
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:10,300
Sure is a hairy fellow.

418
00:25:10,384 --> 00:25:12,427
No, no, that's Scud, you idiot.

419
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:14,929
That is Sid.

420
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,933
-You mean that happy child?
-That ain't no happy child.

421
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:22,270
He tortures toys, just for fun!

422
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:27,942
Well, then we've got
to do something.

423
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:29,861
What are you doing?
Get down from there!

424
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:33,197
-I'm gonna teach that boy a lesson.
-Yeah, sure. You go ahead.

425
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:35,658
Melt him with your scary laser.

426
00:25:35,743 --> 00:25:38,703
Be careful with that!
It's extremely dangerous.

427
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:41,539
He's lighting it!
He's lighting it! Hit the dirt!

428
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,417
Look out!

429
00:25:48,631 --> 00:25:51,215
Yes! He's gone! He's history!

430
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:54,385
I could've stopped him.

431
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:57,639
Buzz, I would love
to see you try.

432
00:25:58,057 --> 00:26:00,183
Of course, I'd love
to see you as a crater.

433
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:03,895
The sooner we move, the better.

434
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:05,772
Yeah!

435
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:13,821
To infinity and beyond!

436
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:17,158
All this packing
makes me hungry.

437
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:20,161
What would you say to dinner
at, oh, Pizza Planet?

438
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:23,164
Pizza Planet? Oh, cool!

439
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:26,000
Go wash your hands,
and I'll get Molly ready.

440
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:29,379
-Can I bring some toys?
-You can bring one toy.

441
00:26:29,463 --> 00:26:32,423
-Just one?
-One toy?

442
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,889
Will Andy pick me?

443
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,478
"Don't count on it"?

444
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:09,210
Buzz! Oh, Buzz!
Buzz Lightyear.

445
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:11,629
Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness.
We've got trouble!

446
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:14,382
-Trouble? Where?
-Down there. Just down there.

447
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:17,218
A helpless toy, it's...
it's trapped, Buzz!

448
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:19,720
Then we've no time to lose.

449
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:26,686
I don't see anything!

450
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,980
Oh, he's there!
Just, just keep looking!

451
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:30,356
What kind of toy...

452
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:50,126
Buzz!

453
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,419
Buzz!

454
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:54,630
I don't see him in the driveway.

455
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:58,342
-I think he bounced into Sid's yard!
-Oh! Buzz!

456
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:04,640
Hey, everyone, R.C.'s trying to
say something. What is it, boy?

457
00:28:04,725 --> 00:28:08,436
-He's saying that this was no accident.
-What do you mean?

458
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,938
-I mean Humpty-Dumpty was pushed...
-No!

459
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:12,273
...by Woody!

460
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:14,192
-What?
-Wait a minute.

461
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:18,529
You don't think I meant to knock Buzz
out the window, do you? Potato Head?

462
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:21,699
That's Mr Potato Head to you,
you back-stabbing murderer!

463
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:23,868
Now, it was an accident, guys.

464
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:26,746
Come on.
Now, you, you gotta believe me.

465
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:30,291
We believe ya, Woody.
Right, Rex?

466
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,877
Well, ye... N...
I don't like confrontations!

467
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:36,631
Where is your honour, dirt bag?
You are an absolute disgrace!

468
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,341
You don't deserve to... Hey!

469
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:41,719
You couldn't handle Buzz cutting
in on your playtime, could you, Woody?

470
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:45,890
Didn't wanna face the fact that Buzz
just might be Andy's new favourite toy.

471
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:47,266
So you got rid of him.

472
00:28:47,351 --> 00:28:50,061
Well, what ifAndy starts playing
with me more, Woody, huh?

473
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:52,063
You gonna knock me
outta the window too?

474
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:54,273
I don't think we should
give him the chance.

475
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:56,400
There he is, men. Frag him!

476
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:57,985
Let's string him up
by his pull string!

477
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,446
-I got dibs on his hat!
-Would you boys stop it!

478
00:29:00,531 --> 00:29:01,572
Tackle him!

479
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:04,242
No, no, no! Wait!
I can explain everything!

480
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:07,245
Okay, Mom, be right down.
I've gotta get Buzz.

481
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:08,454
Retreat!

482
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,419
Mom, do you know
where Buzz is?

483
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:17,004
No, I haven't seen him.

484
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:23,052
-Andy, I'm heading out the door!
-But, Mom, I can't find him!

485
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:25,596
Honey, just grab some other toy.
Now, come on!

486
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:27,682
Oh, okay.

487
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:36,107
I couldn't find my Buzz.
I know I left him right there.

488
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:39,193
Honey, I'm sure he's around.
You'll find him.

489
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,960
It's too short!
We need more monkeys!

490
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:59,130
There aren't any more!
That's the whole barrel!

491
00:30:00,424 --> 00:30:02,466
Buzz, the monkeys
aren't working!

492
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:06,512
We're formulating another plan!
Stay calm!

493
00:30:06,597 --> 00:30:08,556
Oh, where could he be?

494
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:23,404
-Can I help pump the gas?
-Sure! I'll even let you drive.

495
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,489
-Yeah?
-Yeah, when you're 1 6.

496
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:27,491
Funny, Mom.

497
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:31,996
Great. How am I gonna convince
those guys it was an accident?

498
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,627
Buzz!

499
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:42,006
Buzz! Ha! You're alive!

500
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:45,343
This is great!
Oh, I'm saved! I'm saved.

501
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:47,928
Andy'll find you here,
he'll take us back to the room

502
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:53,225
and then you can tell everyone
that this was all just a big mistake.

503
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:56,103
Huh? Right? Buddy?

504
00:30:56,605 --> 00:30:59,565
I just want you to know that even
though you tried to terminate me,

505
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:02,526
revenge is not an idea
we promote on my planet.

506
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:06,656
-Oh. Well, that's good.
-But we're not on my planet, are we?

507
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:07,740
No.

508
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:16,332
Okay, come on!

509
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,584
You want a piece of me?

510
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:28,177
Buzz, Buzz,
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue.

511
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:31,180
-Next stop.
-Pizza Planet! Yeah!

512
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:35,017
Andy!

513
00:31:43,777 --> 00:31:46,320
Wh... Doesn't he realise
that I'm not there?

514
00:31:48,198 --> 00:31:49,990
I'm lost!

515
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:53,327
Oh, I'm a lost toy!

516
00:31:58,667 --> 00:31:59,959
Buzz Lightyear mission log.

517
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:03,421
The local sheriff and I seem to be at
a huge refuelling station of some sort.

518
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:04,547
You!

519
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:28,070
-According to my navi-computer, the...
-Shut up!

520
00:32:28,155 --> 00:32:31,449
-Just shut up, you idiot!
-Sheriff, this is no time to panic.

521
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:35,119
This is the perfect time to panic.
I'm lost. Andy is gone.

522
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:37,413
They're gonna move from their house
in two days, and it's all your fault!

523
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:40,624
My... My fault? If you hadn't pushed me
out of the window in the first place...

524
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:41,792
Oh, yeah?

525
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:44,962
Well, if you hadn't shown up in your
stupid little cardboard spaceship

526
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:47,173
and taken away everything
that was important to me...

527
00:32:47,257 --> 00:32:48,632
Don't talk to me
about importance!

528
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:51,761
Because of you the security
of this entire universe is in jeopardy!

529
00:32:51,845 --> 00:32:54,305
What? What are
you talkin' about?

530
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:57,099
Right now, poised at
the edge of the galaxy, Emperor Zurg

531
00:32:57,184 --> 00:32:58,809
has been secretly building
a weapon

532
00:32:58,894 --> 00:33:02,146
with the destructive capacity
to annihilate an entire planet!

533
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:06,484
I alone have information that reveals
this weapon's only weakness.

534
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:08,778
And you, my friend,
are responsible

535
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:12,239
for delaying my rendezvous
with Star Command!

536
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:15,826
You... are... a... toy!

537
00:33:15,911 --> 00:33:18,162
You aren't the real
Buzz Lightyear! You're a...

538
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:23,042
You're an action figure!
You are a child's plaything!

539
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:27,671
You are a sad, strange little man,
and you have my pity.

540
00:33:27,756 --> 00:33:28,923
Farewell.

541
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:32,092
Oh, yeah?
Well, good riddance, ya loony!

542
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:34,512
"Rendezvous with Star Command."

543
00:33:35,889 --> 00:33:38,140
-Hey, gas dude!
-You talkin' to me?

544
00:33:38,225 --> 00:33:40,684
-Yeah, man. Can you help me?
-Pizza Planet? Andy!

545
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:42,728
Do you know
where Cutting Boulevard is?

546
00:33:42,813 --> 00:33:44,188
Oh, no!

547
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:47,149
I can't show my face
in that room without Buzz.

548
00:33:47,234 --> 00:33:50,152
-Buzz! Buzz, come back!
-Go away!

549
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:53,614
No! Buzz, you gotta
come back! I...

550
00:33:55,492 --> 00:33:57,827
I found a spaceship!

551
00:33:59,496 --> 00:34:01,705
It's a spaceship, Buzz!

552
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:06,794
Come on, man, hurry up! Like,
the pizzas are getting cold here!

553
00:34:07,671 --> 00:34:10,506
-Cutting Boulevard, huh?
-Yeah, yeah. Which way?

554
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:13,467
Now, you're sure this space freighter
will return to its port of origin

555
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:15,970
once it jettisons its food supply?

556
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:20,474
And when we get there, we'll be able
to find a way to transport you home.

557
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:24,103
-Well, then, let's climb aboard.
-No, no, no, wait, Buzz! Buzz!

558
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:26,230
Let's get in the back.
No one will see us there.

559
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:29,525
Negative. There are no restraining
harnesses in the cargo area.

560
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:31,819
-We'll be much safer in the cockpit.
-Yeah, bu...

561
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:34,196
Buzz! Buzz!

562
00:34:34,281 --> 00:34:35,739
That's two lefts
and a right, huh?

563
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:38,742
-Thanks for the directions, okay?
-Yeah. And remember, kid...

564
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:40,244
Buzz!

565
00:34:52,716 --> 00:34:55,551
It's safer in the cockpit
than the cargo bay. What an idiot.

566
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:22,119
Next shuttle lift-off
is scheduled for

567
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:25,623
T-minus 30 minutes and counting.

568
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,211
You are clear to enter.

569
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:33,088
Welcome to Pizza Planet.

570
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:36,884
The white zone
is for immediate pizza...

571
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:38,469
Sheriff!

572
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:41,639
There you are.

573
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:45,017
Now, the entrance is heavily guarded.
We need a way to get inside.

574
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:48,312
Great idea, Woody.

575
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:50,522
I like your thinkin'.

576
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:54,485
You are clear to enter.
Welcome to Pizza Planet.

577
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:56,236
Now!

578
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:59,156
Quickly, Sheriff!
The air lock is closing.

579
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,867
Jones, party of five,
your shuttle is now boarding...

580
00:36:01,952 --> 00:36:03,911
Hey, Mom,
can we have some tokens?

581
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,622
Watch where you're going!

582
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:08,165
Sorry.

583
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:18,384
...nine, eight, seven, six,

584
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:21,553
five, four, three,

585
00:36:21,638 --> 00:36:23,597
two, one.

586
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:27,226
What a spaceport!
Good work, Woody.

587
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:38,862
Mom, can I play Black Hole?
Please, please, please?

588
00:36:38,947 --> 00:36:40,864
-Andy!
-Now, we need to find a ship

589
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:44,368
-that's headed for Sector 1 2.
-Wait a minute. No, Buzz! This way.

590
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:47,788
-There's a special ship. I just saw it.
-You mean it has hyperdrive?

591
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,499
Hyperactive hyperdrive.

592
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:53,460
And Astro... turf!

593
00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:56,046
-Where is it? I don't see the...
-Come on. That's it.

594
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:57,548
Spaceship!

595
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:02,594
All right, Buzz, get ready.
And...

596
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:04,513
-And the universe explodes!
-Okay, Buzz, when I say go,

597
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:07,266
we're gonna jump in the basket.
Buzz!

598
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:10,978
-No!
-Mom, if I eat all my pizza,

599
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:12,563
can I have some alien slime?

600
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:15,399
This cannot be happening to me.

601
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:26,910
-A stranger.
-From the outside.

602
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:31,582
Greetings. I am Buzz Lightyear.

603
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:34,084
I come in peace.

604
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:39,631
Before your space journey,
re-energise yourself

605
00:37:39,716 --> 00:37:43,343
with a slice of pepperoni,
now boarding at counter three.

606
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,305
This is an intergalactic emergency.

607
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:48,849
I need to commandeer
your vessel to Sector 1 2.

608
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:51,310
Who's in charge here?

609
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:54,229
The claw!

610
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,566
The claw is our master.

611
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,902
The claw chooses who will go
and who will stay.

612
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:03,405
-This is ludicrous.
-Hey, bozo, you got a brain in there?

613
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:05,908
Take that!

614
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:09,286
Oh, no! Sid!

615
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:10,954
Get down!

616
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:14,625
What's gotten into you? I was...

617
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:16,877
You are the one that decided
to climb into this...

618
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:19,379
The claw, it moves.

619
00:38:24,886 --> 00:38:26,220
I have been chosen!

620
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:29,932
Farewell, my friends.
I go on to a better place.

621
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,351
Gotcha!

622
00:38:34,104 --> 00:38:37,147
A Buzz Lightyear?
No way!

623
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,124
Yes!

624
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:57,042
Buzz! No!

625
00:38:58,628 --> 00:38:59,753
Hey!

626
00:39:02,257 --> 00:39:03,298
He has been chosen!

627
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:05,008
-He must go.
-Hey!

628
00:39:05,093 --> 00:39:06,635
-What are you doing?
-Do not fight the claw.

629
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:08,846
Stop it! Stop it, you zealots!

630
00:39:12,392 --> 00:39:15,144
All right!
Double prizes!

631
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:20,440
Let's go home and... play.

632
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:36,957
Sheriff, I can see
your dwelling from here.

633
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,168
-You're almost home.
-Nirvana is coming.

634
00:39:39,252 --> 00:39:41,837
-The mystic portal awaits.
-Will you be quiet?

635
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,380
You guys don't get it, do you?

636
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:46,758
Once we go into Sid's house,
we won't be coming out.

637
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:49,303
Whoa, Scud! Hey, boy!

638
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,430
Sit! Good boy.

639
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:54,308
-Hey, I got something for you, boy.
-Freeze!

640
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:58,979
Ready, set, now!

641
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:02,858
Hannah!
Hey, Hannah!

642
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:05,068
-What?
-Did I get my package in the mail?

643
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:07,571
-I don't know.
-What do you mean you don't know?

644
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:09,448
I don't know!

645
00:40:10,283 --> 00:40:13,243
-Oh, no, Hannah! Look, Janie!
-What? Hey!

646
00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:15,120
-She's sick!
-No, she's not!

647
00:40:15,205 --> 00:40:17,664
I'll have to perform
one of my operations.

648
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:20,375
-No!
-No, not Sid's room. Not there.

649
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,336
Hey, give her back!

650
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,254
Sid! Sid!

651
00:40:25,173 --> 00:40:28,467
Oh, no, we have
a sick patient here, nurse.

652
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:30,510
Prepare the OR, stat!

653
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,848
Patient is... prepped.

654
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:40,437
No one's ever attempted a double
bypass brain transplant before.

655
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:44,274
Now for the tricky part.
Pliers!

656
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:47,152
I don't believe that man's
ever been to medical school.

657
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:51,782
Doctor, you've done it!

658
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:54,451
Hannah!

659
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,536
Janie's all better now.

660
00:40:57,705 --> 00:41:01,250
-Mom! Mom!
-She's lying!

661
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:03,961
Whatever she says,
it's not true!

662
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:19,142
We are gonna die.
I'm outta here!

663
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:25,440
Locked.

664
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:27,734
There's gotta be another way
outta here.

665
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:42,207
Buzz? Was that you?

666
00:41:51,801 --> 00:41:54,261
Hey, hi there, little fella.

667
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:57,764
Come out here.
Do you know a way outta here?

668
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:29,546
Buzz!

669
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:42,976
They're cannibals.

670
00:42:46,147 --> 00:42:47,314
Mayday, mayday.

671
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:49,649
Come in, Star Command.
Send reinforcements.

672
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:52,069
Star Command, do you copy?

673
00:42:52,487 --> 00:42:54,905
I've set my laser from stun to kill.

674
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:59,159
Great. Great. Yeah, and if anyone
attacks us, we can blink 'em to death.

675
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:04,706
Hey, you guys,
I think I found him!

676
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:07,501
Buzz, is that you?

677
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,586
Whiskers, will you
get outta here!

678
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:12,547
You're interfering
with the search and rescue!

679
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:15,842
Look, they're home.

680
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:22,599
Mom, have you seen Woody?

681
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:24,267
Where was the last place
you left him?

682
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:25,602
Right here in the van.

683
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:28,355
Oh, I'm sure he's there.
You're just not looking hard enough.

684
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,941
He's not here, Mom.
Woody's gone.

685
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:33,402
Woody's gone?

686
00:43:33,486 --> 00:43:35,445
Yeah, boy, the weasel ran away.

687
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:37,614
Huh? Huh?
I told you he was guilty.

688
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:41,952
Who would've thought he was
capable of such atrocities?

689
00:43:43,371 --> 00:43:46,248
Oh, Slink,
I hope he's okay.

690
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:54,297
Oh, a survivor.
Where's the rebel base? Talk!

691
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:59,261
I can see your will is strong.

692
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:04,057
Well, we have ways
of making you talk.

693
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:16,987
Where are your rebel friends now?

694
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:19,990
Sid, your Pop Tarts are ready!

695
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:21,700
All right!

696
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:36,006
Are you all right?
I'm proud of you, Sheriff.

697
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:38,758
A lesser man would've talked
under such torture.

698
00:44:39,552 --> 00:44:41,845
I sure hope this isn't permanent.

699
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:45,182
Still no word from Star Command.
We're not that far from the space port.

700
00:44:45,266 --> 00:44:47,684
The door. It's open!
We're free!

701
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:48,894
Woody, we don't know
what's out there!

702
00:44:48,978 --> 00:44:50,270
I'll tell you wha...

703
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:54,733
They're gonna eat us, Buzz!
Do something quick!

704
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:56,651
Shield your eyes.

705
00:44:58,613 --> 00:45:01,448
It's not working. I recharged it
before I left. It should be good for...

706
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:05,160
You idiot! You're a toy!
Use your karate chop action!

707
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:07,954
-Get away!
-Hey! Hey! How're you doin' that?

708
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:10,874
-Stop that.
-Back! Back, you savages! Back!

709
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:14,669
-Woody, stop it!
-Sorry, guys, but dinner's cancelled!

710
00:45:15,004 --> 00:45:17,589
There's no place like home!
There's no place like home!

711
00:45:18,466 --> 00:45:20,133
There's no place like home.

712
00:45:34,357 --> 00:45:36,691
Another stunt like that, cowboy,
you're gonna get us killed.

713
00:45:36,776 --> 00:45:39,152
Don't tell me what to do.

714
00:45:58,506 --> 00:46:01,967
Yee-haw! Giddyap, pardner!

715
00:46:02,051 --> 00:46:04,844
We got to get this wagon train
a-movin'!

716
00:46:07,682 --> 00:46:08,974
Split up!

717
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:33,498
Calling Buzz Lightyear.
Come in, Buzz Lightyear.

718
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:35,709
-This is Star Command.
-Star Command!

719
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:38,295
-Buzz Lightyear, do you read me?
-Buzz Lightyear responding.

720
00:46:38,379 --> 00:46:39,462
Read you loud and clear.

721
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:42,048
Buzz Lightyear,
planet Earth needs your help.

722
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:44,301
-On the way!
-Buzz Lightyear!

723
00:46:44,385 --> 00:46:48,888
The world's greatest superhero!
Now the world's greatest toy!

724
00:46:48,973 --> 00:46:51,933
Buzz has it all!
Locking wrist communicator!

725
00:46:52,018 --> 00:46:54,477
-Calling Buzz Lightyear!
-Karate chop action!

726
00:46:54,562 --> 00:46:56,563
-Wow!
-Pulsating laser light!

727
00:46:56,647 --> 00:47:00,025
-Total annihilation!
-Multi-phrase voice simulator!

728
00:47:00,109 --> 00:47:02,235
There's a secret mission
in uncharted space.

729
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,154
There's a secret mission
in uncharted space.

730
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:07,490
And best of all,
high pressure space wings!

731
00:47:07,575 --> 00:47:11,286
-To infinity and beyond!
-Not a flying toy.

732
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:12,996
Get your Buzz Lightyear action figure

733
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:16,333
-and save a galaxy near you!
-Buzz Lightyear!

734
00:47:16,417 --> 00:47:19,919
Available at all Al's Toy Barn outlets
in the tri-county area.

735
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:24,299
And welcome back to the Point
Richmond Bowling Championship.

736
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:31,723
Out among the stars I sail

737
00:47:31,807 --> 00:47:34,517
Way beyond the moon

738
00:47:36,187 --> 00:47:40,565
In my silver ship I sailed

739
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:44,778
To a dream
that ended too soon

740
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:47,697
Now I know exactly

741
00:47:47,782 --> 00:47:51,284
Who I am and what I'm here for

742
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:54,788
You are a toy! You can't fly!

743
00:47:56,624 --> 00:48:01,127
And I will go sailing

744
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,839
No more

745
00:48:09,512 --> 00:48:13,473
But no, it can't be true

746
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:16,726
I could fly if I wanted to

747
00:48:16,811 --> 00:48:19,521
Like a bird in the sky

748
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:22,440
If I believed I could fly

749
00:48:22,525 --> 00:48:25,151
Why, I'd fly

750
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:28,029
To infinity and beyond!

751
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:47,590
Clearly, I

752
00:48:47,675 --> 00:48:52,387
Will go sailing

753
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:55,056
No more

754
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:11,614
Mom! Mom, have you seen
my Sally doll?

755
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:14,534
What, dear? What was that?

756
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:17,245
Never mind!

757
00:49:24,545 --> 00:49:27,380
Buzz, the coast is clear.
Buzz, where are you?

758
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:30,967
There's a secret mission
in uncharted space. Let's go.

759
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:34,387
Really?
That is so interesting.

760
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:38,099
Would you like some tea,
Mrs Nesbitt?

761
00:49:38,726 --> 00:49:39,726
Buzz!

762
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:42,687
It's so nice you could join us
on such late notice.

763
00:49:42,772 --> 00:49:46,357
-Oh, no!
-What a lovely hat, Mrs Nesbitt.

764
00:49:46,442 --> 00:49:48,610
It goes quite well with your head.

765
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:51,988
Hannah! Oh, Hannah!

766
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:54,824
Mom? Please excuse me, ladies.

767
00:49:54,909 --> 00:49:56,701
I'll be right back.

768
00:49:59,455 --> 00:50:03,500
What is it, Mom?
Mom, where are you?

769
00:50:03,584 --> 00:50:06,085
Buzz. Hey.
Buzz, are you okay?

770
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:09,339
Gone! It's all gone.

771
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:12,300
All of it's gone.
Bye-bye. See ya.

772
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:13,426
What happened to you?

773
00:50:13,511 --> 00:50:16,179
One minute you're defending
the whole galaxy.

774
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:20,225
And suddenly you find yourself
suckin' down Darfeeling with

775
00:50:20,309 --> 00:50:23,478
Marie Antoinette
and her little sister.

776
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:27,690
I think you've had
enough tea for today.

777
00:50:27,775 --> 00:50:29,526
Let's get you outta here, Buzz.

778
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:32,570
Don't you get it?
You see the hat?

779
00:50:32,655 --> 00:50:37,617
-I am Mrs Nesbitt!
-Snap out of it, Buzz!

780
00:50:41,497 --> 00:50:43,706
I'm sorry. I...
You're right.

781
00:50:43,791 --> 00:50:46,668
I am just a little depressed.
That's all.

782
00:50:46,752 --> 00:50:48,795
I can get through this.

783
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:50,672
Oh, I'm a sham!

784
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:52,048
-Look at me.
-Quiet, Buzz.

785
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:55,009
I can't even fly out of a window.

786
00:50:55,094 --> 00:50:58,346
The hat looked good?
Tell me the hat looked good.

787
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:01,224
-The apron is a bit much.
-"Out the window"!

788
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:03,601
Buzz, you're a genius!

789
00:51:03,686 --> 00:51:05,019
Come on, come on. This way.

790
00:51:05,104 --> 00:51:08,273
Years of academy, training, wasted!

791
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:10,733
B-3.

792
00:51:10,818 --> 00:51:12,902
Miss! G-6.

793
00:51:12,987 --> 00:51:15,196
You sunk it. Are you peeking?

794
00:51:15,281 --> 00:51:18,575
Oh, quit your whinin' and pay up.
No, no, not the ear.

795
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:21,119
-Give me the nose. Come on.
-How about three out of five?

796
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:25,498
Hey, guys! Guys! Hey!

797
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:29,252
-Son of a building block. It's Woody.
-He's in the psycho's bedroom.

798
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:31,754
-Hi!
-Everyone! It's Woody!

799
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:32,839
-Woody?
-You're kidding!

800
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:36,050
-Woody?
-We're gonna get outta here, Buzz.

801
00:51:36,552 --> 00:51:37,760
Buzz?

802
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,225
-Hey, look!
-Woody!

803
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:46,436
Oh, boy, am I glad
to see you guys.

804
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:49,188
-I knew you'd come back, Woody.
-What are you doin' over there?

805
00:51:49,273 --> 00:51:51,733
It's a long story, Bo.
I'll explain later.

806
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:53,818
Here! Catch this!

807
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:57,405
-Whoa! I've got it, Woody.
-He got it, Woody.

808
00:51:57,489 --> 00:52:00,366
Good goin', Slink. Nowjust,
just tie it on to somethin'.

809
00:52:00,451 --> 00:52:02,952
Wait, wait, wait, wait. I got
a better idea. How 'bout we don't?

810
00:52:03,037 --> 00:52:04,370
-Hey!
-Potato Head.

811
00:52:04,455 --> 00:52:06,414
Did you all take stupid pills
this morning?

812
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:08,458
Have you forgotten
what he did to Buzz?

813
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:10,084
And now you wanna let him
back over here?

814
00:52:10,169 --> 00:52:14,589
No! No, no, no, no, no! You got it...
You got it all wrong, Potato Head.

815
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:17,008
Buzz is fine. Buzz is right here.
He's with me!

816
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:20,386
-You are a liar!
-No, I'm not. Buzz, come over here.

817
00:52:20,471 --> 00:52:24,223
Tell the nice toys that you're...
that you're not dead.

818
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:28,144
Just a sec!

819
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:31,356
Buzz, will you get up here
and give me a hand?

820
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:34,859
That's very funny, Buzz.

821
00:52:34,944 --> 00:52:38,029
-This is serious!
-Hey, Woody! Where'd ya go?

822
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:40,198
He's lying. Buzz ain't there.

823
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:42,992
Oh! Hi, Buzz!

824
00:52:43,077 --> 00:52:46,162
Why don't you say hello
to the guys over there?

825
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:49,958
Hiya, fellas!
To infinity and beyond!

826
00:52:50,042 --> 00:52:51,834
Hey, look! It's Buzz!

827
00:52:51,919 --> 00:52:56,839
Hey, Buzz, let's show the guys
our new secret best friends handshake.

828
00:52:56,924 --> 00:52:58,257
Give me five, man!

829
00:52:58,342 --> 00:52:59,509
Something's screwy here.

830
00:52:59,593 --> 00:53:02,470
So you see we're friends now, guys.
Aren't we, Buzz?

831
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:04,472
You bet. Give me a hug.

832
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:07,016
Boy, I love you too.

833
00:53:07,101 --> 00:53:08,685
See? It is Buzz.

834
00:53:08,769 --> 00:53:10,395
Now give back the lights,
Potato Head.

835
00:53:10,479 --> 00:53:11,938
Wait just a minute.

836
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:14,565
-What are you tryin' to pull?
-Nothing!

837
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:20,613
-Oh, that is disgusting.
-Murderer!

838
00:53:20,698 --> 00:53:22,782
-No! No, no, no, no, no!
-You murdering dog!

839
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:25,201
-It's not what you think. I swear!
-Save it for the jury.

840
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:27,870
I hope Sid pulls
your voice box out, ya creep.

841
00:53:27,955 --> 00:53:29,872
No, no! No, no!
Don't leave! Don't leave!

842
00:53:29,957 --> 00:53:32,917
Ya gotta help us, please! You don't
know what it's like over here!

843
00:53:33,002 --> 00:53:34,335
Come on.
Let's get outta here.

844
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:37,046
Go back to your lives, citizens.
Show's over.

845
00:53:37,131 --> 00:53:39,716
Come back! Slink!

846
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:43,720
Slink! Please!
Please! Listen to me!

847
00:53:43,804 --> 00:53:47,056
No! No! Come back!

848
00:53:47,141 --> 00:53:49,642
Slinky!

849
00:53:58,402 --> 00:54:00,903
Buzz! Go away!

850
00:54:00,988 --> 00:54:02,697
You disgusting freaks!

851
00:54:04,116 --> 00:54:06,451
All right, back!
Back, you cannibals!

852
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:14,876
He is still alive, and you're
not gonna get him, you monsters!

853
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,753
What are you doin'?

854
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:21,758
Hey. Hey, they fixed you.

855
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:26,888
But they're cannibals.

856
00:54:26,972 --> 00:54:29,515
We saw them eat
those other toys.

857
00:54:37,775 --> 00:54:40,401
Sorry. I thought
that you were gonna...

858
00:54:41,236 --> 00:54:43,071
You know, you know, eat my friend.

859
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:45,239
Hey, no, no, wait, hey!

860
00:54:45,324 --> 00:54:46,741
-What's wrong?
-Sid?

861
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:48,493
Not now, Mom! I'm busy!

862
00:54:48,577 --> 00:54:50,995
-Sid! Buzz, come on!
-You left that door open.

863
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:55,500
Get up! Use your legs! Fine!
Let Sid trash you! But don't blame me!

864
00:54:57,795 --> 00:55:01,047
It came!
It finally came!

865
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:05,885
"The Big One."

866
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:11,307
"Extremely dangerous.

867
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:14,102
"Keep out of reach of children."

868
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:18,648
Cool! What am I gonna blow?

869
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:21,609
Man. Hey, where's
that wimpy cowboy doll?

870
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:40,920
Yes. I've always wanted
to put a spaceman into orbit.

871
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:52,849
Now. Yes.

872
00:55:57,271 --> 00:55:59,230
Oh, no!

873
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:03,442
Oh, man!

874
00:56:10,117 --> 00:56:11,868
Sid Phillips reporting.

875
00:56:11,952 --> 00:56:13,494
Launch of the shuttle
has been delayed

876
00:56:13,579 --> 00:56:16,247
due to adverse weather
conditions at the launch site.

877
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:19,208
Tomorrow's forecast, sunny.

878
00:56:20,711 --> 00:56:22,420
Sweet dreams.

879
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:31,304
I looked everywhere, honey,
but all I could find was your hat.

880
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:33,556
But what if we
leave them behind?

881
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:35,391
Oh, don't worry, honey.

882
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:38,895
I'm sure we'll find Woody and Buzz
before we leave tomorrow.

883
00:56:47,321 --> 00:56:48,487
I need air!

884
00:56:49,156 --> 00:56:50,656
Will you quit movin' around?

885
00:56:50,741 --> 00:56:54,368
I'm sorry. It's just that I get...
I get so nervous before I travel.

886
00:56:54,453 --> 00:56:56,871
How did I get stuck
with you as a moving buddy?

887
00:56:56,955 --> 00:56:59,123
Everyone else was picked.

888
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:07,215
Oh, Woody.

889
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:12,136
If only you could see
how much Andy misses you.

890
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:27,777
Hey, Buzz!

891
00:57:34,368 --> 00:57:38,204
Hey. Get over here and see if
you can get this toolbox off me.

892
00:57:40,916 --> 00:57:43,751
Oh, come on, Buzz, I...

893
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:47,964
Buzz, I can't do this without you.
I need your help.

894
00:57:49,633 --> 00:57:52,843
I can't help.
I can't help anyone.

895
00:57:52,928 --> 00:57:55,805
Why, sure you can, Buzz.
You can get me outta here.

896
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:59,225
Then I'll get that rocket off you, and
we'll make a break for Andy's house.

897
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:02,812
Andy's house, Sid's house.
What's the difference?

898
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:06,983
Oh, Buzz. You've had a big fall.
You must not be thinking clearly.

899
00:58:07,067 --> 00:58:10,528
No, Woody. For the first time
I am thinking clearly.

900
00:58:10,612 --> 00:58:13,281
You were right all along.
I'm not a Space Ranger.

901
00:58:13,365 --> 00:58:17,576
I'm just a toy, a stupid,
little, insignificant toy.

902
00:58:17,661 --> 00:58:18,911
Whoa, hey, wait a minute.

903
00:58:18,996 --> 00:58:22,415
Bein' a toy is a lot better
than bein' a, a Space Ranger.

904
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:24,834
-Yeah, right.
-No, it is.

905
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:27,962
Look, over in that house is a kid
who thinks you are the greatest.

906
00:58:28,046 --> 00:58:30,715
And it's not because
you're a Space Ranger, pal.

907
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:34,677
It's because you're a toy.
You are his toy.

908
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:36,345
But why would Andy want me?

909
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:41,726
Why would Andy want you?
Look at you! You're a Buzz Lightyear.

910
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:44,520
Any other toy would give up
his moving parts just to be you.

911
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:48,149
You've got wings.
You glow in the dark. You talk!

912
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:51,610
Your helmet does
that, that, that whoosh thing.

913
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:54,780
You are a cool toy.

914
00:58:58,285 --> 00:59:01,120
As a matter of fact,
you're too cool.

915
00:59:01,705 --> 00:59:04,957
I mean, I mean, what chance
does a toy like me have

916
00:59:05,042 --> 00:59:08,336
against a Buzz Lightyear
action figure?

917
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:11,005
All I can do is...

918
00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:15,509
There's a snake in my boots.

919
00:59:15,594 --> 00:59:17,887
Why would Andy ever want
to play with me

920
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:20,681
when he's got you?

921
00:59:21,475 --> 00:59:25,144
I'm the one that should be
strapped to that rocket.

922
00:59:47,918 --> 00:59:51,003
Listen, Buzz, forget about me.

923
00:59:51,088 --> 00:59:54,006
You should get outta here
while you can.

924
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:07,311
Buzz? What are you doin'?
I thought you were...

925
01:00:07,396 --> 01:00:10,439
Come on, Sheriff. There's a kid
over in that house who needs us.

926
01:00:10,524 --> 01:00:12,483
Now let's get
you out of this thing.

927
01:00:12,567 --> 01:00:13,943
Yes, sir!

928
01:00:16,530 --> 01:00:18,656
Come on, Buzz.
We can do it.

929
01:00:24,704 --> 01:00:26,455
Woody, it's the moving van.

930
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:28,707
We gotta get outta here now.

931
01:00:33,547 --> 01:00:35,172
Come on, Buzz.

932
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:37,967
All right.

933
01:00:39,428 --> 01:00:42,221
-Hey, I'm out!
-Almost there.

934
01:00:47,269 --> 01:00:49,562
I want to ride the pony.

935
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:57,278
Woody? Woody?
Are you all right?

936
01:00:58,155 --> 01:01:00,739
I'm fine. I'm okay.

937
01:01:11,293 --> 01:01:14,753
Oh, yeah!
Time for lift-off!

938
01:01:17,716 --> 01:01:20,593
To infinity and beyond!

939
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:31,812
Back, back.

940
01:01:31,897 --> 01:01:33,647
Down, down!

941
01:01:34,316 --> 01:01:36,400
Okay, what do I do?
Come on, Woody. Think.

942
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:40,779
Guys!

943
01:01:42,491 --> 01:01:45,034
No, no, no, no! Wait!
Wait. Listen, please.

944
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:46,452
There's a good toy down there,

945
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:49,663
and he's gonna be blown
to bits in a few minutes.

946
01:01:49,748 --> 01:01:53,292
All because of me.
We gotta save him.

947
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:56,128
And...
But I need your help.

948
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:06,180
Please. He's my friend.

949
01:02:07,224 --> 01:02:09,600
And he's the only one I've got.

950
01:02:22,822 --> 01:02:26,492
Thank you.
Okay, I think I know what to do.

951
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:28,661
We're gonna have
to break a few rules.

952
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:31,872
But if it works,
it'll help everybody.

953
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:45,553
Houston to Mission Control.
Come in, Control.

954
01:02:45,845 --> 01:02:49,014
Launch pad is being constructed.

955
01:02:50,725 --> 01:02:51,934
All right, listen up.

956
01:02:52,018 --> 01:02:54,812
I need Pump Boy here,
Ducky here.

957
01:02:54,896 --> 01:02:57,606
Legs, you're with Ducky.

958
01:02:58,358 --> 01:03:01,026
RollerBob and I don't move
'til we get the signal. Clear?

959
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:04,572
Okay. Let's move!

960
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:26,594
Wind the frog.

961
01:03:48,783 --> 01:03:50,909
Wait for the signal.

962
01:04:06,301 --> 01:04:07,801
Go!

963
01:04:11,431 --> 01:04:13,265
All right, let's go!

964
01:04:13,767 --> 01:04:15,309
I'll get it!

965
01:04:15,393 --> 01:04:16,602
Now!

966
01:04:17,312 --> 01:04:19,104
I'm coming. I'm coming.

967
01:04:29,115 --> 01:04:30,449
Scud!

968
01:04:34,621 --> 01:04:36,288
Stupid dog.

969
01:04:44,047 --> 01:04:45,589
Lean back!

970
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:53,931
Mission Control, is the
launch pad construction complete?

971
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:56,558
Roger. Rocket is now
secured to guide wire.

972
01:04:56,643 --> 01:05:00,229
We are currently obtaining
the ignition sticks.

973
01:05:00,313 --> 01:05:02,064
Countdown will commence
momentarily.

974
01:05:02,148 --> 01:05:04,400
-Stand by.
-Let's go.

975
01:05:04,484 --> 01:05:08,737
Hey, Ma! Where are the matches?
Oh, wait. Here they are. Never mind.

976
01:05:08,822 --> 01:05:11,281
Woody! Great!
Help me outta this thing.

977
01:05:11,825 --> 01:05:15,244
-What?
-It's okay. Everything's under control.

978
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:17,996
Woody, what are you doing?

979
01:05:18,081 --> 01:05:22,334
Houston. All systems are go.
Requesting permission to launch...

980
01:05:23,294 --> 01:05:25,713
Hey? How'd you get out here?

981
01:05:27,382 --> 01:05:30,426
Oh, well. You and I
can have a cookout later.

982
01:05:34,013 --> 01:05:36,473
Houston, do we have
permission to launch?

983
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:39,059
Roger. Permission granted.

984
01:05:39,144 --> 01:05:43,272
You are confirmed
at "T" minus ten seconds.

985
01:05:43,356 --> 01:05:47,109
And counting.
Ten, nine,

986
01:05:47,193 --> 01:05:49,945
eight, seven, six,

987
01:05:50,029 --> 01:05:53,157
five, four, three, two,

988
01:05:53,241 --> 01:05:57,369
-one!
-Reach for the sky!

989
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:02,249
This town ain't big enough
for the two of us.

990
01:06:02,333 --> 01:06:03,625
What?

991
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:06,295
Somebody's poisoned the water hole.

992
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:10,382
-It's busted.
-Who are you callin' busted, buster?

993
01:06:11,342 --> 01:06:12,468
That's right.

994
01:06:12,552 --> 01:06:16,263
I'm talking to you, Sid Phillips.

995
01:06:16,347 --> 01:06:19,141
We don't like bein' blown up, Sid,

996
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:21,185
or smashed or ripped apart.

997
01:06:21,269 --> 01:06:24,730
-"We"?
-That's right! Your toys!

998
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:27,065
Mama!

999
01:06:27,567 --> 01:06:28,901
Mama!

1000
01:06:29,486 --> 01:06:32,571
Mama! Mama!

1001
01:06:54,469 --> 01:06:55,677
Mama!

1002
01:06:56,596 --> 01:07:00,808
From now on, you must take
good care of your toys!

1003
01:07:00,892 --> 01:07:04,978
Because if you don't,
we'll find out, Sid.

1004
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:11,401
We toys can see everything.

1005
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:14,947
So play nice.

1006
01:07:21,204 --> 01:07:24,748
We did it! We did it! Yes!

1007
01:07:24,833 --> 01:07:27,459
The toys!
The toys are alive!

1008
01:07:27,752 --> 01:07:29,211
Nice toy.

1009
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:34,383
What's wrong, Sid?

1010
01:07:34,467 --> 01:07:37,219
Don't you want to play with Sally?

1011
01:07:38,346 --> 01:07:40,556
Nice work, fellows.
Good job.

1012
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:43,225
Comin' out of the ground, what a touch.
That was a stroke of genius.

1013
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:45,018
Woody.

1014
01:07:46,479 --> 01:07:47,813
Thanks.

1015
01:07:49,607 --> 01:07:51,400
Everybody say, "Bye, house!"

1016
01:07:51,484 --> 01:07:53,777
-Woody! The van!
-Bye, house.

1017
01:07:56,698 --> 01:07:58,365
We gotta run! Thanks, guys!

1018
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:03,161
Quick!

1019
01:08:08,293 --> 01:08:10,252
Just go. I'll catch up.

1020
01:08:31,608 --> 01:08:32,858
Come on!

1021
01:08:48,374 --> 01:08:50,208
You can do it, Woody!

1022
01:08:52,462 --> 01:08:54,212
I got it!

1023
01:08:54,923 --> 01:08:56,381
I made it.

1024
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:03,805
Get away,
you stupid dog! Down!

1025
01:09:03,890 --> 01:09:06,475
-Down!
-Hold on, Woody!

1026
01:09:07,727 --> 01:09:10,145
I can't do it.

1027
01:09:11,189 --> 01:09:13,565
Take care ofAndy for me!

1028
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:15,192
No!

1029
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:17,986
Buzz!

1030
01:09:45,264 --> 01:09:46,348
Are we there already?

1031
01:09:46,432 --> 01:09:48,016
-Woody?
-How did you...?

1032
01:09:48,101 --> 01:09:49,393
-How'd he get here?
-Where have you...?

1033
01:09:49,477 --> 01:09:50,727
What happened?

1034
01:09:50,812 --> 01:09:52,938
-What's goin' on?
-What's he takin'?

1035
01:09:53,773 --> 01:09:55,065
There you are!

1036
01:09:55,149 --> 01:09:57,025
Hey. What's he doing?

1037
01:10:00,113 --> 01:10:01,863
He's at it again!

1038
01:10:13,292 --> 01:10:15,460
-Get him!
-Come on!

1039
01:10:24,303 --> 01:10:25,595
No, no!

1040
01:10:29,392 --> 01:10:31,643
No, no, no, no! Wait!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1041
01:10:39,819 --> 01:10:41,528
Pig pile!

1042
01:11:03,593 --> 01:11:05,927
-Get outta that car!
-Move it!

1043
01:11:08,139 --> 01:11:10,098
No! Please!
You don't understand!

1044
01:11:10,183 --> 01:11:12,225
Buzz is out there.
We gotta help him.

1045
01:11:12,310 --> 01:11:14,644
-No!
-Toss him overboard!

1046
01:11:14,729 --> 01:11:16,480
No, no, no! Wait!

1047
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:21,485
-Hooray!
-So long, Woody!

1048
01:11:27,033 --> 01:11:28,658
Oh! Woody!

1049
01:11:29,035 --> 01:11:32,037
-Oh! Well, thanks for the ride.
-Look out!

1050
01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:38,168
Now let's catch up
to that truck.

1051
01:11:45,551 --> 01:11:48,178
Guys! Guys! Woody's riding R.C.

1052
01:11:48,262 --> 01:11:50,388
-What?
-And Buzz is with him!

1053
01:11:54,685 --> 01:11:55,811
It is Buzz!

1054
01:11:55,895 --> 01:11:57,896
Woody was telling the truth.

1055
01:11:57,980 --> 01:12:01,358
-What have we done?
-Great! Now I have guilt.

1056
01:12:01,442 --> 01:12:03,568
We're almost there!

1057
01:12:04,779 --> 01:12:06,988
Rocky, the ramp!

1058
01:12:14,747 --> 01:12:16,123
Look out!

1059
01:12:16,916 --> 01:12:19,292
Quick! Hold onto my tail!

1060
01:12:24,423 --> 01:12:29,427
-Attaboy, Slink!
-Oh! Woody!

1061
01:12:29,887 --> 01:12:30,846
Woody! Speed up!

1062
01:12:30,930 --> 01:12:32,848
-Speed up!
-The batteries!

1063
01:12:32,932 --> 01:12:34,599
They're runnin' out!

1064
01:12:50,616 --> 01:12:54,911
-I can't hold on much longer.
-Slink! Hang on!

1065
01:13:10,678 --> 01:13:11,928
Great!

1066
01:13:14,765 --> 01:13:16,600
Woody! The rocket!

1067
01:13:16,684 --> 01:13:19,227
The match! Yes!

1068
01:13:19,312 --> 01:13:21,188
Thank you, Sid!

1069
01:13:28,321 --> 01:13:30,405
No! No, no! No!

1070
01:13:30,489 --> 01:13:33,992
No! Oh, no!

1071
01:13:34,076 --> 01:13:37,913
No, no, no, no, no,

1072
01:13:37,997 --> 01:13:39,748
no!

1073
01:13:39,832 --> 01:13:41,541
No!

1074
01:13:50,509 --> 01:13:53,678
-Woody! What are you doing?
-Hold still, Buzz!

1075
01:13:56,307 --> 01:13:57,432
You did it!

1076
01:13:57,808 --> 01:13:59,392
Next stop, Andy!

1077
01:13:59,477 --> 01:14:03,563
Wait a minute. I just lit a rocket.
Rockets explode!

1078
01:14:14,158 --> 01:14:16,618
I should have held on longer.

1079
01:14:16,702 --> 01:14:19,829
Look! Look! It's Woody
and Buzz comin' up fast!

1080
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:22,332
Woody!

1081
01:14:31,342 --> 01:14:32,801
Take cover!

1082
01:14:40,101 --> 01:14:42,227
This is the part
where we blow up!

1083
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:43,728
Not today!

1084
01:14:55,283 --> 01:14:57,492
Hey, Buzz!
You're flyin'!

1085
01:14:57,576 --> 01:15:00,870
This isn't flying.
This is falling with style.

1086
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:07,836
To infinity and beyond!

1087
01:15:14,051 --> 01:15:16,094
Buzz, we missed the truck.

1088
01:15:16,178 --> 01:15:18,263
We're not aiming for the truck.

1089
01:15:25,021 --> 01:15:26,021
Hey, wow!

1090
01:15:26,105 --> 01:15:28,315
-What? What is it?
-Woody! Buzz!

1091
01:15:28,399 --> 01:15:30,400
Oh, great, you found them.
Where were they?

1092
01:15:30,484 --> 01:15:32,569
-Here in the car!
-See?

1093
01:15:32,653 --> 01:15:35,947
Now, what'd I tell you?
Right where you left 'em.

1094
01:15:44,623 --> 01:15:48,209
-Which one can I open first?
-Let's let Molly open one.

1095
01:15:54,091 --> 01:15:55,383
Frankincense, this is Myrrh.

1096
01:15:55,468 --> 01:15:57,802
Hey, heads up, everybody.
It's show time.

1097
01:15:57,887 --> 01:15:59,763
Whoa! It's time!

1098
01:16:01,807 --> 01:16:03,224
Oh, Bo.

1099
01:16:03,309 --> 01:16:05,727
There's got to be a less painful way
to get my attention.

1100
01:16:05,811 --> 01:16:07,896
Merry Christmas, Sheriff.

1101
01:16:09,023 --> 01:16:11,441
Say, isn't that mistletoe?

1102
01:16:13,944 --> 01:16:17,447
Maybe Andy will get another dinosaur.
Like a leaf eater.

1103
01:16:17,531 --> 01:16:20,909
That way I could play
the dominant predator.

1104
01:16:20,993 --> 01:16:22,035
Quiet, everyone! Quiet!

1105
01:16:22,119 --> 01:16:25,789
Molly's first present
is Mrs Potato Head.

1106
01:16:25,873 --> 01:16:27,916
Repeat, a Mrs Potato Head.

1107
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,085
Way to go, Idaho!

1108
01:16:30,169 --> 01:16:32,212
Gee, I'd better shave.

1109
01:16:36,926 --> 01:16:38,301
Come in, Frankincense.

1110
01:16:38,386 --> 01:16:40,387
Andy is now opening
his first present.

1111
01:16:40,471 --> 01:16:43,264
-It's...
-Buzz. Buzz Lightyear,

1112
01:16:43,349 --> 01:16:45,308
-you are not worried, are you?
-I can't quite...

1113
01:16:45,393 --> 01:16:46,810
-Me? No, no.
-Make out...

1114
01:16:46,894 --> 01:16:49,562
No. No, no, no, no.

1115
01:16:49,647 --> 01:16:51,981
A large box... It's...

1116
01:16:52,066 --> 01:16:54,651
-Are you?
-Now, Buzz,

1117
01:16:54,735 --> 01:16:58,988
what could Andy possibly get
that is worse than you?

1118
01:17:00,366 --> 01:17:02,075
Oh, what is it? What is it?

1119
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:04,077
Wow! A puppy!

1120
01:17:19,135 --> 01:17:22,387
You've got a friend in me

1121
01:17:23,681 --> 01:17:26,724
You've got a friend in me

1122
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:31,104
When the road looks rough ahead

1123
01:17:31,188 --> 01:17:36,025
And you're miles and miles
from your nice, warm bed

1124
01:17:36,110 --> 01:17:39,529
You just remember
what your old pal said

1125
01:17:39,613 --> 01:17:42,407
Boy, you've got a friend in me

1126
01:17:43,909 --> 01:17:47,579
Yeah, you've got a friend in me

1127
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:55,962
You've got a friend in me

1128
01:17:57,173 --> 01:17:59,757
You've got a friend in me

1129
01:18:01,427 --> 01:18:05,471
-You got troubles
-And I got 'em too

1130
01:18:05,556 --> 01:18:09,601
There isn't anything
I wouldn't do for you

1131
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:12,687
If we stick together
we can see it through

1132
01:18:12,771 --> 01:18:16,107
'Cause you've got a friend in me

1133
01:18:17,943 --> 01:18:20,486
You've got a friend in me

1134
01:18:22,281 --> 01:18:26,284
Some other folks might be
a little bit smarter than I am

1135
01:18:26,368 --> 01:18:29,370
Bigger and stronger too

1136
01:18:29,455 --> 01:18:30,538
Maybe

1137
01:18:30,623 --> 01:18:36,252
But none of them will ever love you
the way I do

1138
01:18:36,337 --> 01:18:38,922
It's me and you, boy

1139
01:18:39,006 --> 01:18:42,425
And as the years go by

1140
01:18:42,509 --> 01:18:45,595
Our friendship will never die

1141
01:18:47,139 --> 01:18:51,976
You're gonna see it's our destiny

1142
01:18:52,061 --> 01:18:56,022
You've got a friend in me

1143
01:18:56,106 --> 01:18:58,650
You've got a friend in me

1144
01:19:00,319 --> 01:20:40,877
You've got a friend in me
