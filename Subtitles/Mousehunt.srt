00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:08,984
Hold your end up higher.
You're not holding it.

4
00:01:09,068 --> 00:01:10,694
I am, too.

5
00:01:10,778 --> 00:01:13,697
-You are not.
-Don't worry about me.

6
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:18,202
Hey, isn't that suit charcoal?

7
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,162
No.

8
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:23,582
Looks charcoal gray to me.
Some gray polyester blend.

9
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:25,626
You'd think
you could find a black suit

10
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,503
for your own father's funeral.

11
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:30,006
-It's black.
-No. I'm sure it's gray.

12
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:31,131
-It's black.
-Gray.

13
00:01:31,215 --> 00:01:32,216
-Black.
-Gray.

14
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,301
-Black.
-Fine, it's black.

15
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:37,263
It's the grayest black I've ever seen.

16
00:01:37,346 --> 00:01:39,181
It doesn't matter what color it is!

17
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:46,272
I'm sorry, Pop. I'm sorry!

18
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:00,953
Quick! Get him out of there!

19
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:03,330
He's halfway to the harbor
by now, bub.

20
00:02:03,914 --> 00:02:04,915
Well.

21
00:04:10,374 --> 00:04:14,544
"I leave you not just a model factory,

22
00:04:14,628 --> 00:04:18,256
"but something
infinitely more valuable.

23
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:20,968
"The future of string...

24
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:23,762
"itself.

25
00:04:33,647 --> 00:04:37,192
"And thus, it is my dying wish

26
00:04:37,276 --> 00:04:40,862
"that my two sons
run Smuntz String together."

27
00:04:40,946 --> 00:04:43,365
Great. Let's stick
a "For Sale" sign up on the lawn

28
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:44,533
and see what we can get.

29
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:48,245
Ernie, we're not supposed to sell it.
We're supposed to run it. Together.

30
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:51,248
Either way,
this godforsaken museum piece

31
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:53,584
is not worth a dime. Now, is it, Lars?

32
00:04:53,667 --> 00:04:56,503
Some things are more important
than money, Ernie.

33
00:04:56,587 --> 00:05:00,299
Notice it's always the financially
challenged who say that.

34
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:02,009
Please, please.

35
00:05:03,385 --> 00:05:06,846
"I also bequeath to you
my personal effects,

36
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:11,143
"including my ceramic egg,

37
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:17,650
"half box of Cuban cigars.. ."

38
00:05:17,733 --> 00:05:19,526
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

39
00:05:20,861 --> 00:05:22,904
"My collection of spoons."

40
00:05:25,324 --> 00:05:28,744
My goodness, what a treasure.
What a legacy.

41
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,874
Spoons! Spoons!
So many spoons, so little time.

42
00:05:35,584 --> 00:05:38,253
And, of course, something no household
should be without.

43
00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:39,629
The ceramic egg!

44
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:42,591
Can I have the egg? Can I?

45
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:47,805
-No, I want you to have it.
-Fine, I'll take it!

46
00:05:47,888 --> 00:05:50,223
Look, if you find any real estate
on that desk, you let me know.

47
00:05:50,307 --> 00:05:53,768
Well, it seems there is also a house.

48
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,772
-A house?
-Yes, "5120 Nortondale."

49
00:05:58,065 --> 00:06:02,565
Your father acquired it
many years ago as payment of a debt.

50
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:06,574
He never lived there,
but it's interesting.

51
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:11,157
It seems the previous owner was found
locked in a trunk in the attic.

52
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:14,164
Wait a minute. Is it worth anything?

53
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:17,960
Well, he was able to borrow $50,000
against it to pay his workers.

54
00:06:18,043 --> 00:06:19,919
Really? So, what is its value today?

55
00:06:21,213 --> 00:06:22,422
Fifty thousand dollars.

56
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:24,925
Great.

57
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:27,428
A worthless house
and a broken-down string factory.

58
00:06:28,178 --> 00:06:31,890
Well, at least
the day wasn't a total loss.

59
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:33,684
Thanks for the stogies, Pop.

60
00:06:35,477 --> 00:06:37,270
Wait. You can't go, Ernie.

61
00:06:37,354 --> 00:06:38,938
We have to go through
all these papers.

62
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,528
You'll have to excuse me.

63
00:06:46,071 --> 00:06:47,572
I've got a date with the Mayor.

64
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:56,957
Mr. Mayor! Mr. Mayor, over here!
Mr. Mayor!

65
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,209
Mr. Mayor, do you think
your recent triple heart bypass

66
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:00,544
will affect your campaign strategy?

67
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,254
Now, Leslie, I'm just here to eat.

68
00:07:04,506 --> 00:07:09,006
<i>Monsieur le maire,
madame maire,</i> welcome to Chez Ernie.

69
00:07:09,803 --> 00:07:13,264
What an honor it is to have you
in my humble bistro.

70
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:18,020
You brought the little ones.
The little bicycle thieves.

71
00:07:18,103 --> 00:07:20,980
<i>Bonjour!</i> Our very best table.

72
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:23,108
-Have you lost a little weight?
-I...

73
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:25,777
I think so! I think you may be buff.

74
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,867
-You know what I mean?
<i>-Monsieur</i> Ernie!

75
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,251
The air's not so thin at the top.

76
00:07:43,462 --> 00:07:46,047
Just like the old man to die
before I hit it big.

77
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:53,805
Remember, everyone.
Attention to detail is vital!

78
00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:57,475
Presentation is everything.

79
00:07:58,435 --> 00:08:02,105
No, no, no!
These I must deliver myself.

80
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:14,910
Duck a l'Orange avec du quack sauce.

81
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:18,831
And for <i>ze Mayor,
la specialitÃ© de la maison,</i>

82
00:08:18,914 --> 00:08:22,375
Lobster Loaf Ã  la Ernest
ou la bibliotheque.

83
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,169
Bon appetit.

84
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:29,508
<i>Bonjour!</i>

85
00:08:29,591 --> 00:08:31,134
Chef Ernie,
how does it feel to be serving

86
00:08:31,218 --> 00:08:33,136
the Mayor on the eve
of his campaign re-election?

87
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:36,431
-Well, Leslie. May I call you Leslie?
-Of course.

88
00:08:40,769 --> 00:08:44,481
Crunchy! I love the almonds.

89
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:47,734
Leslie, cuisine,
she is a fickle mistress...

90
00:08:49,236 --> 00:08:50,237
Look!

91
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,072
A cockroach!

92
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,662
That's only half a cockroach.

93
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:01,415
Daddy! You ate the head!

94
00:09:01,498 --> 00:09:03,082
Honey, are you okay?

95
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:17,973
Not again!

96
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,601
Was this an accident or murder...

97
00:09:21,518 --> 00:09:22,519
Clear!

98
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:25,564
I can do that better!

99
00:09:35,991 --> 00:09:39,577
Smuntz String is a relic of history.

100
00:09:40,579 --> 00:09:44,332
You don't make string by twining
two strands together anymore.

101
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:48,670
No. You make it simple,
singular, strong, with nylon.

102
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:51,339
But that's not string. That's cord.

103
00:09:51,423 --> 00:09:52,507
Exactly.

104
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:55,552
Twine is yesterday.
Single strong cord is today.

105
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:58,639
Zeppco International has been
interested in your factory for years,

106
00:09:58,722 --> 00:10:00,390
but your father refused to sell.

107
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:02,392
We're hoping
you would be a little smarter.

108
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:04,895
Zeppco is willing to buy you out

109
00:10:04,978 --> 00:10:08,147
and bring this museum
into the 21 st century.

110
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:10,567
Of course, we will keep you on
as a string consultant,

111
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:12,986
with a huge salary
and a hefty pension.

112
00:10:14,446 --> 00:10:15,447
-So.. .
-Well...

113
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,118
What do you say?

114
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:43,308
-My sons.. .
-Ernie.

115
00:10:44,726 --> 00:10:47,979
-Ernie!
-Yeah. Just a sec.

116
00:10:48,063 --> 00:10:52,563
I want you to have something.

117
00:10:52,734 --> 00:10:55,862
My most prized possession.

118
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:59,741
It's a piece of string.

119
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:04,325
Not just any string. The string.

120
00:11:05,038 --> 00:11:09,538
I found it my first day in America.

121
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,711
What's with the string?

122
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,547
It's been in my pocket for 60 years.

123
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:16,716
Here! I want you two to share it.

124
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,595
Maybe it'll bring you closer together.

125
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:24,307
-You haven't talked much lately.
-Yeah.

126
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,560
-What are you doing?
-I'm breaking it in half.

127
00:11:27,644 --> 00:11:28,895
-No!
-No?

128
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:31,189
I want you to share it.

129
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:34,192
-Forever.
-Sure, Pop, sure.

130
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:36,903
Here. You carry it the first 50 years,
I'll take the next.

131
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,030
Sure.

132
00:11:38,113 --> 00:11:40,240
And turn up
the morphine drip a little.

133
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:42,075
I heard that.

134
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,499
Promise me that you will never sell

135
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,836
Smuntz String

136
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,923
to one of those big conglomerates.

137
00:11:56,006 --> 00:12:00,506
Keep it
between you... brothers, family.

138
00:12:02,095 --> 00:12:03,096
Promise.

139
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:05,223
I promise, Pop.

140
00:12:06,516 --> 00:12:09,852
-I promise.
-So, you were saying?

141
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,981
I'll have to pass.

142
00:12:14,107 --> 00:12:15,108
What?

143
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:20,989
"A world without string is chaos."

144
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:26,703
For once the Smuntz name
was worth something!

145
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:28,038
No, no! Don't!

146
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,626
You used to love string!

147
00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:33,835
That was before,

148
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:37,088
when I was dating the son
of a wealthy string magnate!

149
00:12:37,172 --> 00:12:38,173
Not now,

150
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:42,219
when I am married to the half-owner
of a worthless deathtrap!

151
00:12:44,137 --> 00:12:47,348
I thought you'd be happy!
I stood up for myself today!

152
00:12:48,308 --> 00:12:50,435
April, I've got new ideas
for the factory.

153
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,020
You know, I've got big plans!

154
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,106
Don't you see, Lars?

155
00:12:54,189 --> 00:12:56,941
That's all you've ever had are plans.

156
00:12:57,025 --> 00:13:01,525
But my life is passing me by,
and I need more!

157
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:04,824
There's no air
in the middle class, Lars.

158
00:13:04,908 --> 00:13:06,659
I can't breathe here.

159
00:13:06,743 --> 00:13:08,077
Please, April, don't go.

160
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:10,872
I'm not going anywhere.

161
00:13:28,181 --> 00:13:31,934
<i>In a few brief moments,
the joy of the holidays was shattered</i>

162
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:34,312
<i>and the world changed for many people.</i>

163
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:37,399
<i>Mayor McKrinkle died
this afternoon at 4:30 p.m.</i>

164
00:13:37,482 --> 00:13:39,609
<i>at Our Lady of Sorrows Hospital.</i>

165
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:43,697
<i>Doctors here say the official cause
of death is heart failure</i>

166
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:46,574
<i>due to the Mayor's recent
culinary disaster.</i>

167
00:13:46,658 --> 00:13:49,994
<i>And once the hottest restaurants
on the wharf, Chez Ernie</i>

168
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:51,287
<i>has been condemned and...</i>

169
00:13:51,371 --> 00:13:53,206
Excuse me, I'm sorry,

170
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:56,418
I don't think I ordered
my cheese sandwich with capers.

171
00:13:56,501 --> 00:13:58,461
<i>We go live to Leslie Reinhart
for more updates.</i>

172
00:13:58,545 --> 00:13:59,587
I'm sorry.

173
00:13:59,671 --> 00:14:02,674
<i>If there is a villain in this tragedy,
it is Ernie Smuntz.</i>

174
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:05,927
Hey, Ernie. You're on the TV again!

175
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,053
What?

176
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:10,682
You know what this is? I'll tell ya.

177
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:13,435
-Guilt by accusation.
-No capers.

178
00:14:13,935 --> 00:14:15,186
No capers?

179
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:17,188
But that's just grilled cheese.
What's the point?

180
00:14:17,272 --> 00:14:19,148
Why don't they eat out of a trough?

181
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:22,110
All right, which one of you
palateless sheep

182
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,445
sent my sandwich back?

183
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,073
-Hi, Ernie!
-Lars?

184
00:14:29,826 --> 00:14:31,202
When I'm in the kitchen, I cook.

185
00:14:31,286 --> 00:14:34,330
I can't control every single thing
that goes on in there.

186
00:14:34,414 --> 00:14:37,542
You know, it really isn't fair
for everybody to blame you.

187
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:39,085
You didn't do anything wrong.

188
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:42,797
Yes. But society always needs somebody
to persecute,

189
00:14:42,881 --> 00:14:47,381
a scapegoat, someone to demonize.
The same thing happened to Galileo.

190
00:14:47,552 --> 00:14:49,762
Really? That's unbelievable.

191
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:52,056
With a cockroach and everything?

192
00:14:52,849 --> 00:14:53,975
No.

193
00:14:54,601 --> 00:14:57,395
The point is, I put everything I had
into that restaurant.

194
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:59,731
It was my livelihood and my home.

195
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:03,151
In one fatal bite,
it was all taken away from me.

196
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,320
If only we could sell the factory.

197
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:09,904
I'd let you stay with me, you know,
but April threw me out.

198
00:15:10,992 --> 00:15:12,159
That's too bad.

199
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,246
Yeah, well, don't worry about me,
though Ernie.

200
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:16,497
This is temporary.

201
00:15:16,581 --> 00:15:18,207
April's been like this
since high school.

202
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:20,209
She'll be back. I...

203
00:15:20,293 --> 00:15:24,793
Would you look at that?
Sleeping in the street. Pitiful.

204
00:15:27,717 --> 00:15:30,344
If I had a house, I'd sleep in it!

205
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:33,849
Ernie, do you remember
how close we were as kids?

206
00:15:33,932 --> 00:15:34,933
No.

207
00:15:35,642 --> 00:15:37,727
Hey! Merry Christmas!

208
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:41,815
Yeah, I was on top once, too.

209
00:15:41,898 --> 00:15:43,608
But there's only one way
to go from there,

210
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:46,653
and that's down, baby, down!

211
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,324
Ernie.

212
00:15:52,784 --> 00:15:56,746
Ernie, there was a quarter in there.

213
00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:00,542
A quarter? You think so small, Lars.

214
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:02,668
Look at the bigger picture.

215
00:16:02,752 --> 00:16:05,546
You have no home, you have no wife,
you have no money.

216
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:09,091
You have no discernible talents.
How can you ignore that?

217
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:12,053
Ernie, it's Christmas.

218
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,264
Instead of dwelling
on what we don't have,

219
00:16:15,348 --> 00:16:17,641
we should be thankful
for what we do have.

220
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,655
What a dump.

221
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,002
I can't believe
Pops never told us about this house.

222
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:29,172
It's huge.

223
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,676
This is just the kind of house
I'd expect him to have.

224
00:17:33,468 --> 00:17:35,887
It's just like him. Cold and spooky.

225
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:44,271
-Did you feel that?
-What?

226
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:45,730
I got a chill.

227
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:47,524
You shouldn't talk
about Pop like that.

228
00:17:48,066 --> 00:17:50,234
Really? What's this do for you?

229
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:55,444
Thanks for nothing,
you string-sucking old loon!

230
00:17:58,076 --> 00:17:59,410
He didn't mean it, Pop.

231
00:18:03,331 --> 00:18:04,874
Ernie! Ernie!

232
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:15,677
Only one bed. I'll flip you for it.

233
00:18:18,888 --> 00:18:19,889
Heads.

234
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:41,620
Ernie?

235
00:18:43,371 --> 00:18:44,580
Ernie. Ernie.

236
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:51,045
-You asleep?
-I was.

237
00:18:51,129 --> 00:18:52,463
How can you sleep through that?

238
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,800
-What? I don't hear anything.
-That.

239
00:18:56,968 --> 00:19:00,346
Listen. Hear it?
It's coming from upstairs.

240
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:22,577
Mothballs.

241
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:29,125
Hey, stop it! Hey!

242
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:41,929
Ernie. Ernie.

243
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,722
Wait. Wait a minute. Stop. Stop!

244
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:28,017
Look. Look, look, look.
It's only a toy.

245
00:20:36,317 --> 00:20:37,318
Shut up!

246
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:46,119
It's coming from up there!

247
00:20:49,789 --> 00:20:52,875
One, two, three!

248
00:21:01,801 --> 00:21:04,595
-It's just a mouse.
-What?

249
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:07,765
It's just a mouse. Never mind.

250
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:11,394
Hey, there are some posters up here.

251
00:21:12,937 --> 00:21:14,313
Stand still!

252
00:21:28,953 --> 00:21:30,704
They're blueprints.

253
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:35,168
Wait a minute.
Look at this date, 1876.

254
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,463
A centennial house
could actually be worth something.

255
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,716
Look, this must be the architect.
Here, look.

256
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:44,636
"Charles Lyle LaRue."

257
00:21:46,554 --> 00:21:51,054
-Charles Lyle LaRue.
-Charles Lyle LaRue?

258
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:57,899
Charles Lyle LaRue.

259
00:22:00,443 --> 00:22:03,028
Charles Lyle LaRue!

260
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:06,157
Charles Lyle LaRue!

261
00:22:07,158 --> 00:22:11,658
I'm actually standing
in the missing LaRue!

262
00:22:12,413 --> 00:22:15,874
-It's bold yet subtle.
-Classical yet non-traditional.

263
00:22:16,417 --> 00:22:17,626
The missing LaRue.

264
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:19,753
The rumored design completed

265
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:22,924
shortly before his committal
is a rumor no more.

266
00:22:23,007 --> 00:22:24,383
Before his committal?

267
00:22:24,467 --> 00:22:26,510
Well, I'm just glad
he finished the place

268
00:22:26,594 --> 00:22:29,013
before they carted him off
to the laughing academy.

269
00:22:32,308 --> 00:22:33,851
So, what do you think

270
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:35,811
a magnificent edifice
like this is worth?

271
00:22:37,021 --> 00:22:38,564
Properly restored, of course.

272
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:43,069
Well, his Parma Charnel House
went for six...

273
00:22:43,152 --> 00:22:44,319
But that was 10 years ago,

274
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:46,447
and it didn't have
this exquisite molding.

275
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:48,950
I see.
I can't get enough of good molding.

276
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,414
Did you hear that? $600,000.

277
00:22:55,206 --> 00:22:57,166
Alexander Falko!

278
00:22:58,126 --> 00:22:59,377
Back!

279
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:02,463
Gentlemen, congratulations.

280
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:06,717
Congratulations on your find.
I'm a great admirer of LaRue.

281
00:23:06,801 --> 00:23:07,885
Glass of rainwater, please.

282
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:11,263
Yes, Mr. Falko was the world's
leading collector of LaRues.

283
00:23:11,347 --> 00:23:15,476
Sort of like collecting stamps,
but they're bigger, right?

284
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:20,060
I'll get to the point. LaRue.
I have his books and his letters.

285
00:23:20,231 --> 00:23:22,358
You see these shoes?

286
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:23,443
-LaRues?
-LaRues?

287
00:23:23,526 --> 00:23:24,944
No, but I'm sure
he would have loved them.

288
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:26,863
Vegetarian snack.

289
00:23:26,946 --> 00:23:31,446
I own 42 LaRue houses, 42.
I want to make it 43.

290
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:35,204
You tell me how I'm going to do this.

291
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:38,666
Tell me how I will do this.
Help me. How will I do this?

292
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,752
Well, I'm glad you asked.

293
00:23:40,835 --> 00:23:43,462
His, Parma Charnel House went for six,

294
00:23:43,546 --> 00:23:46,006
but that was 10 years ago
and it didn't have this molding.

295
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:48,717
I'd say a find like this
in today's market

296
00:23:48,801 --> 00:23:49,802
is worth twice as much.

297
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:51,554
He's a LaRue connoisseur.

298
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:53,306
Guilty as charged.

299
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,475
Gentlemen, I'm going
to make you an offer.

300
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,727
No, no, no,
I couldn't possibly be so crass

301
00:23:58,811 --> 00:24:00,145
as to allow you to do that.

302
00:24:00,229 --> 00:24:02,898
But you are welcome
to come to the auction.

303
00:24:02,982 --> 00:24:04,858
-Auction?
-Auction, yes.

304
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,653
It would be grossly unfair of us

305
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:09,613
to deprive others of the chance
to bid on the missing LaRue.

306
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,369
May I have just one moment
with my brother, please?

307
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:16,620
-Sure. Of course.
-Thank you.

308
00:24:16,704 --> 00:24:17,705
Excuse me, please.

309
00:24:19,248 --> 00:24:21,458
-What is this?
-It's the...

310
00:24:21,542 --> 00:24:23,001
-What is this?
-It's the first I've heard...

311
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:24,087
No. No.

312
00:24:26,422 --> 00:24:27,840
What are you doing?

313
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:29,884
What am I doing?
I'm answering your prayers.

314
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:31,678
These pigeons are ripe for plucking.

315
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:33,971
Put them in a room together
try and outbid each other?

316
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:37,892
-We'll make $700,000, $800,000 easy.
-Man, you're smart!

317
00:24:40,436 --> 00:24:42,271
-You're going to get this.. .
-Don't talk to me!

318
00:24:42,897 --> 00:24:46,108
So, when is the earliest
we can set the auction?

319
00:24:46,192 --> 00:24:50,692
Well, I suppose all arrangements
could be completed within the week.

320
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:52,407
-A week it is.
-Great!

321
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:54,241
You're smarter than you look.

322
00:24:54,325 --> 00:24:55,617
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

323
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:58,663
But know this.

324
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:01,874
I have never paid
more than $10 million

325
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:03,542
for a house in my life!

326
00:25:18,933 --> 00:25:20,517
Okay, see you, then.

327
00:25:20,601 --> 00:25:23,270
Yeah. Thanks for stopping by.

328
00:25:29,485 --> 00:25:31,153
Ten million linen napkins.

329
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:35,741
Five million bales
of top-grade cotton fiber.

330
00:25:36,784 --> 00:25:40,746
Forty thousand hot lamps complete
with rotating plate-warming trays.

331
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:44,542
Two thousand twine threaders,
gleaming under real lights.

332
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:47,419
My own chain
of fine gourmet restaurants.

333
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:51,090
April can have
anything she's ever wanted!

334
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:55,386
Cars, coats, china. She loves china.

335
00:25:57,972 --> 00:25:59,974
I'm gonna build
an Olympic size swimming pool

336
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:02,769
fill it with pina coladas
and college girls.

337
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:09,984
If only Pop were here
to see this house!

338
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:12,612
He did. He just wasn't smart enough
to sell it.

339
00:26:12,695 --> 00:26:16,532
Lars, we've turned a corner.
Our future is staring us in the face.

340
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:21,116
And all we have to do is grab it,
baste it and scarf it down!

341
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:34,675
We've finally found our friend's home!

342
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:36,886
Well, I bought
a little present for ya, buddy.

343
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:42,600
Ernie, it's just a little mouse.
Do we really have to kill it?

344
00:26:42,683 --> 00:26:46,561
Yes. Listen to me.
A single vermin can bring you down.

345
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:47,980
Believe me, I know.

346
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:39,907
-I trust you slept well.
-Like a baby.

347
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,710
Hey, last night,
did you happen to hear the...

348
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:55,339
-Yeah. Let's see.
-Yeah.

349
00:28:03,097 --> 00:28:04,890
-Well, where'd he go?
-I don't know.

350
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:06,558
Maybe it snapped by itself.

351
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:09,729
I don't believe it.

352
00:28:11,397 --> 00:28:15,897
He snapped the trap, ate the olive,
and left the pit just to mock us.

353
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,447
I think you're giving him
a little too much credit.

354
00:28:20,948 --> 00:28:22,157
Mice don't mock.

355
00:28:22,241 --> 00:28:24,826
They don't have
a sense of humor or irony.

356
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:27,246
He's not sitting in his hole
in a smoking jacket,

357
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:30,750
sipping cognac and giggling
to himself, "I left the pit."

358
00:28:30,833 --> 00:28:34,169
The trap snapped itself,
the olive flew off, and he ate it.

359
00:28:34,253 --> 00:28:35,420
It's just that simple.

360
00:28:35,504 --> 00:28:38,840
But now that he knows we're here,
he won't come within a mile of us.

361
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:41,677
I don't think we'll be seeing
any more of that... Mouse!

362
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:52,145
What are you doing, you stupid nitwit?

363
00:28:53,856 --> 00:28:56,483
Don't! Give me that!
Don't let him get away!

364
00:29:25,012 --> 00:29:26,596
Are you trying to kill me?

365
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:30,351
The mouse!

366
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:35,397
Let me see. Let me see!

367
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:37,399
Can you see him?

368
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:40,194
Get me my Gouda.

369
00:29:44,156 --> 00:29:48,160
-Careful, careful !
-Don't touch me. You'll snap it.

370
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:50,746
-Well, you're not doing it right.
-Please, let me concentrate, will ya?

371
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,540
I'm putting it on carefully.
I am not...

372
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:55,209
Relax. It's cheese.

373
00:29:58,254 --> 00:29:59,755
Bon appetit.

374
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:03,842
That takes care of that.

375
00:30:26,907 --> 00:30:27,908
Hey!

376
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:31,829
Hey! What are you doing?

377
00:32:50,676 --> 00:32:52,427
Lars! Gimme a hand with this.

378
00:32:58,267 --> 00:33:00,894
You sure this tub fits
in with the rest of the house?

379
00:33:00,978 --> 00:33:03,647
Jacuzzi tub, Lars. It's a Jacuzzi tub.

380
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:06,316
And this isn't just a house.
It's a LaRue.

381
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,276
Of course it fits in with the decor.

382
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:11,613
-Luxury is timeless.
-How much, Ernie?

383
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:14,783
It was a steal at $1 ,200.

384
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:16,952
$1 ,200?

385
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:19,496
You spent our last money on a tub!

386
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,373
A Jacuzzi tub!

387
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:23,459
You have to spend money to make money.

388
00:33:23,542 --> 00:33:26,795
They threw in the cardboard lady
just to sweeten the deal.

389
00:34:08,003 --> 00:34:09,004
Well...

390
00:34:18,013 --> 00:34:20,557
Don't you think
this is a little... much?

391
00:34:21,725 --> 00:34:23,560
Never underestimate your opponent.

392
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:27,189
Let's say he has mastered a way

393
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:29,441
to empty a mousetrap
without getting caught.

394
00:34:30,442 --> 00:34:32,819
If he snaps one of these babies,

395
00:34:32,903 --> 00:34:35,947
a chain reaction
will start snapping them all.

396
00:34:36,031 --> 00:34:37,157
He'll panic,

397
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:39,576
and the law of averages
says one has to nab him.

398
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:43,706
Not bad.

399
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:47,584
Yes. Well, I like
to use both sides of my brain.

400
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:49,002
Come on, let's hit the sack.

401
00:35:26,915 --> 00:35:29,292
-Have you figured it out yet?
-Shut up.

402
00:35:29,376 --> 00:35:31,336
I'm thinking. I'm thinking!

403
00:35:45,517 --> 00:35:47,268
Ernie. Ernie!

404
00:35:52,399 --> 00:35:56,694
Keep perfectly still. This is it.

405
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:18,509
-What's he doing?
-I don't know.

406
00:36:31,146 --> 00:36:32,147
That was good.

407
00:36:54,878 --> 00:36:56,421
He's goin' for the cherries!

408
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:01,593
But you said mice like Gouda.

409
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:03,470
Not in the morning !
Cheese tires them out.

410
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:05,097
They need fruit for energy.

411
00:37:25,659 --> 00:37:27,827
Oh, no!

412
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:58,859
There he goes!

413
00:38:02,237 --> 00:38:04,906
-Juice!
-Got it!

414
00:38:08,952 --> 00:38:10,995
This game is over!

415
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,138
-I think it's working !
-Yeah.

416
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:36,730
I felt something.

417
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:39,774
Keep sucking!

418
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:50,410
Goddamn, that mouse stinks!

419
00:38:51,578 --> 00:38:53,621
Dead animals always do.

420
00:39:06,301 --> 00:39:07,844
Keep sucking, Ernie!

421
00:39:10,055 --> 00:39:11,389
Yeah, this'll get him!

422
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,581
What's this?

423
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:38,458
We're foreclosing on your house.

424
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,210
You quit paying your mortgage.

425
00:39:40,919 --> 00:39:44,380
Wait a minute, there's been
some mistake, this house is paid for.

426
00:39:44,464 --> 00:39:47,550
No, it was paid for,
but you borrowed against it.

427
00:39:47,634 --> 00:39:51,095
If you don't pay the $1 ,200 overdue,
we repossess it.

428
00:39:51,179 --> 00:39:55,016
-$1 ,200?
-Well, how long do we have?

429
00:39:56,310 --> 00:40:00,439
One week from, five days ago.

430
00:40:00,522 --> 00:40:03,608
But, that's two days!

431
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:05,193
Look, we don't have
the time or the energy

432
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:06,820
to deal with these petty problems now.

433
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:09,156
We're in the midst
of an extensive renovation.

434
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:11,491
Looks like
you're off to a great start.

435
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:16,288
You can ask your boss at Wimpy's
for an advance.

436
00:40:16,371 --> 00:40:17,747
You can pay him back
after the auction.

437
00:40:17,831 --> 00:40:19,040
Couldn't you ask your workers

438
00:40:19,124 --> 00:40:20,542
to forfeit their salaries
for a few weeks?

439
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:21,710
You are the boss.

440
00:40:21,793 --> 00:40:24,587
Well, if you hadn't spent
all our money on that Jacuzzi tub,

441
00:40:24,671 --> 00:40:26,255
we still might be able
to pay the mortgage.

442
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,216
It doesn't help to start crying now,
does it?

443
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:32,595
No, Fluffy! No!

444
00:40:32,679 --> 00:40:35,390
No! I want my kitty!

445
00:40:36,141 --> 00:40:37,559
No, no! No!

446
00:40:53,867 --> 00:40:55,368
That one's cute.

447
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:58,663
He doesn't have that killer instinct.

448
00:41:16,556 --> 00:41:20,434
Morning, gentlemen. I'm Maury.
Anything I can help you with?

449
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:22,979
Hi, Maury. We need a cat.

450
00:41:25,023 --> 00:41:28,609
Find the one you want
and I'll spay or neuter it myself.

451
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:31,947
Well, these are all kittens.

452
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:35,616
We were hoping for an older cat.
One with experience.

453
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:36,868
That's a switch.

454
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:39,704
Most people like the cute little ones.
Experience with what?

455
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:41,831
-Mouse hunting.
-All cats are good mousers.

456
00:41:41,915 --> 00:41:45,376
Yes. But we have huge rats
the size of sumo wrestlers

457
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:46,502
and lots of them.

458
00:41:46,586 --> 00:41:49,589
So, we really need a ferocious feline,

459
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:51,299
preferably with a history
of mental illness.

460
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:53,510
I'm talking one mean pussy.

461
00:41:53,593 --> 00:41:56,554
Yeah ! A vicious cat,
difficult to love.

462
00:41:56,638 --> 00:41:59,682
Do you have any of those
knocking around your cages?

463
00:41:59,766 --> 00:42:04,228
Funny you should ask. I had all
but given up on anyone wanting him.

464
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:07,190
We were about to gas him again.

465
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:10,360
-Again?
-Again?

466
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:14,030
He's spent most of his whole life
in that box, I expect.

467
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:16,950
"Catzilla"?

468
00:42:17,367 --> 00:42:19,118
You know,
the guys who clean up call him that.

469
00:42:19,202 --> 00:42:21,871
But you can call him
anything you want.

470
00:42:21,955 --> 00:42:24,499
I'd say he looks like a "Fluffy."

471
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:31,756
Poor little Catzilla.

472
00:42:32,799 --> 00:42:35,676
You want a home, don't you?
You wanna get out of here.

473
00:42:36,636 --> 00:42:39,930
Well, you're gonna have
to kill, kill, kill for it.

474
00:42:40,015 --> 00:42:41,975
You're a stupid cat, aren't you?

475
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:46,021
Yes, you are. And ugly. Extremely...

476
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:54,695
-You little bastard.
-We'll take him.

477
00:42:59,701 --> 00:43:00,785
Here, boy.

478
00:43:14,674 --> 00:43:15,966
He's got the scent now.

479
00:43:16,051 --> 00:43:18,094
Yeah, go get him, boy.

480
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:23,100
Easy, easy, easy, easy!

481
00:43:32,275 --> 00:43:34,402
I almost feel sorry
for the little fella.

482
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:37,030
-Almost!
-Almost!

483
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:47,433
It's time to stop worrying
about that mouse

484
00:44:47,517 --> 00:44:49,977
and start thinking about
how we're gonna locate $1 ,200.

485
00:44:50,061 --> 00:44:52,646
Don't worry, Ernie.
The workers will help us out.

486
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:55,984
You see, the truth is,

487
00:44:57,194 --> 00:45:00,655
we don't actually have any money.

488
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:14,498
We may have to defer
your next paycheck or two.

489
00:45:14,794 --> 00:45:17,713
So my brother and I can pay
the mortgage on the house.

490
00:45:17,797 --> 00:45:19,548
It's the missing LaRue!

491
00:45:20,717 --> 00:45:22,343
There's no need for violence!

492
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:25,180
Wait!

493
00:45:25,263 --> 00:45:26,722
Put that thing down.

494
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:49,079
Ernie!

495
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:51,873
What's the matter?

496
00:45:51,957 --> 00:45:56,419
Well, the workers, they didn't react
as positively as I hoped.

497
00:45:59,381 --> 00:46:00,548
No?

498
00:46:02,008 --> 00:46:03,175
What are you doing?

499
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:04,970
You could fit
through this window, right?

500
00:46:05,053 --> 00:46:07,430
What? I guess so.

501
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:08,515
Come on.

502
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:16,898
But, Lars, that was our last resort!

503
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:19,401
We're gonna have to find the money
some place else.

504
00:46:37,585 --> 00:46:41,130
Gosh, it's a shame nobody's interested
in buying the factory.

505
00:46:41,214 --> 00:46:43,633
Yeah, yeah, it's a shame.

506
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:45,969
But who'd be stupid enough
to buy the factory, right?

507
00:46:46,928 --> 00:46:47,929
Yeah.

508
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:36,454
You must be... Caesar.

509
00:48:36,538 --> 00:48:39,624
Well, Mr. Caesar, we're glad
you could get here so quickly.

510
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:13,741
You have mice.

511
00:49:16,077 --> 00:49:17,244
He's good.

512
00:49:18,329 --> 00:49:19,872
5120 Nortondale.

513
00:49:20,790 --> 00:49:23,584
January 4th, 0800 hours.

514
00:49:23,668 --> 00:49:25,920
Don't forget to get toothpaste
and Saran Wrap.

515
00:49:26,588 --> 00:49:29,382
We're in sort of a hurry. I just
wanna warn you about this mouse.

516
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:32,385
Yeah ! You got asbestos, all right!

517
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:36,472
I'll bet
it's up in the ceiling, mostly!

518
00:49:38,266 --> 00:49:42,520
Shouldn't take me more than a day
or two to remove it.

519
00:49:45,982 --> 00:49:50,482
Okay, then.
So, we're gonna go upstairs!

520
00:49:51,863 --> 00:49:54,282
All right, well,
we'll all go upstairs!

521
00:49:54,365 --> 00:49:55,366
Yeah.

522
00:49:58,036 --> 00:49:59,829
Okay, then. Yeah.

523
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:06,043
What are you doing?

524
00:50:08,254 --> 00:50:09,964
He's not listening anymore.

525
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:14,135
Good. Well, you're the expert.

526
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:16,512
I just hope you can take care
of this, whatever it takes.

527
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:19,098
We've been trying
to catch this menace all week.

528
00:50:20,308 --> 00:50:21,851
Here's your problem.

529
00:50:21,935 --> 00:50:23,895
Normal people are not...

530
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:28,024
psychologically equipped
to catch mice.

531
00:50:28,107 --> 00:50:31,527
You have to get inside their mind.

532
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:34,822
You have to know
what they want... need.

533
00:50:34,906 --> 00:50:37,700
You have to think like a mouse.

534
00:50:37,784 --> 00:50:41,245
If you can do that,
if you can think like a mouse,

535
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:44,206
you can anticipate their moves.

536
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:48,502
Then, boom ! <i>Sayonara,</i> mouse.

537
00:50:48,586 --> 00:50:51,338
Well, you got some great stuff.

538
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:55,176
Never touch that!

539
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:59,347
-All right!
-What is it?

540
00:51:01,432 --> 00:51:02,433
The big one.

541
00:51:03,643 --> 00:51:05,269
It's a flea bomb!

542
00:51:05,353 --> 00:51:06,979
Works on mice, too.

543
00:51:07,689 --> 00:51:12,189
Yeah? It better. Because we can't
handle any more intrusions.

544
00:51:12,318 --> 00:51:15,029
Sure. That's how you perceive it.

545
00:51:17,448 --> 00:51:18,991
But to that mouse,

546
00:51:19,075 --> 00:51:21,994
you are the intruder.

547
00:51:33,715 --> 00:51:36,759
I think if we work fast, we can make
enough string to meet our orders.

548
00:51:36,843 --> 00:51:39,136
That's the spirit. Just a few cases
so we can keep the LaRue.

549
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:41,055
-Good luck.
-Yeah. No. Wait! Where are you going?

550
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:42,640
-Aren't you going to help?
-I have to run a little errand.

551
00:51:42,724 --> 00:51:43,766
I'll see you later.

552
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:46,269
All you have to do is make
$1 ,200 worth. How long can that take?

553
00:51:46,352 --> 00:51:49,021
Light a match,
they're frightened by fire!

554
00:53:54,939 --> 00:53:56,565
Unsanitary creature.

555
00:53:59,235 --> 00:54:02,821
Defecating... in the dining room.

556
00:54:07,034 --> 00:54:09,536
0915. Evidence found.

557
00:54:13,791 --> 00:54:17,753
<i>Mus communis.</i> Male.

558
00:54:22,049 --> 00:54:26,386
Ten to 12 centimeters long,

559
00:54:28,931 --> 00:54:29,932
with a...

560
00:54:34,729 --> 00:54:37,815
What's this?
A slight calcium deficiency.

561
00:54:39,275 --> 00:54:40,442
That's interesting.

562
00:54:48,576 --> 00:54:51,161
Hi. This is Ernest Smuntz
of Smuntz String.

563
00:54:51,245 --> 00:54:53,747
Is this the business representative
for Zeppco International?

564
00:54:54,749 --> 00:54:57,835
Vinny? Hi, Vinny.
I'm glad I can call you Vinny.

565
00:54:58,586 --> 00:55:01,880
My brother and I have decided
to reconsider your generous offer.

566
00:55:01,964 --> 00:55:04,800
I'd love to discuss
selling our factory to you.

567
00:55:04,884 --> 00:55:06,886
No, not at the office.

568
00:55:06,969 --> 00:55:10,180
How about Ellman Square
under the big clock at noon?

569
00:56:36,225 --> 00:56:40,562
You, you must be Mrs. Lars Smuntz?

570
00:56:40,646 --> 00:56:43,273
I'm afraid
that status is in transition.

571
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:48,154
Well, is Lars in? I'd like to discuss
preparations for the auction.

572
00:56:48,654 --> 00:56:50,072
The auction?

573
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:09,258
Careful, Lars. You might catch a cold.

574
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:11,594
April!

575
00:57:14,263 --> 00:57:17,349
You look like you could use
some warming up.

576
00:57:23,814 --> 00:57:28,314
Thirteen hundred hours.
I've activated the Squeak Seeker 2000.

577
00:57:28,736 --> 00:57:31,029
I'm about to join with the prey.

578
00:57:47,546 --> 00:57:51,424
I'm experiencing malfunction
with the plasma screen. Stand by.

579
00:58:02,478 --> 00:58:03,729
Junk.

580
00:58:13,364 --> 00:58:14,531
Nothing works.

581
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:44,854
What?

582
00:58:52,403 --> 00:58:53,404
Oh, nuts!

583
00:59:39,992 --> 00:59:43,954
EKG, a C-spine, a chest x-ray
and pelvis. Now move!

584
00:59:44,038 --> 00:59:45,748
Twelve hundred dollars...

585
00:59:45,831 --> 00:59:47,916
Lie still, Mr. Smuntz,
you've just been hit by a bus.

586
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,711
I feel fine. What time is it?

587
00:59:50,795 --> 00:59:53,339
You may have had a concussion.
We're gonna do a series of x-rays.

588
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:54,924
You don't understand, Doc.

589
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:57,259
I have to get out of here.
I might still have a chance.

590
00:59:57,343 --> 00:59:58,802
We saved your hat.

591
00:59:59,678 --> 01:00:02,180
-I'm sorry. Are you family?
-Yes, we are sisters.

592
01:00:02,264 --> 01:00:04,432
Great. There's some paperwork
I need for you to fill out.

593
01:00:04,517 --> 01:00:05,518
Is he an organ donor?

594
01:00:05,601 --> 01:00:07,311
Don't let them fill anything.
I don't even know them.

595
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:09,897
I'm Hilde and this is Ingrid.

596
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:14,025
-We are hair models from Belgium.
-Belgian hair models. How exotic.

597
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:16,445
Listen to me, Doc.
I need to find a phone

598
01:00:16,529 --> 01:00:19,198
before I miss out
on the most important deal of my life.

599
01:00:19,281 --> 01:00:20,740
I think your brother
is a little delirious.

600
01:00:20,825 --> 01:00:23,577
I am not their brother.
I don't have any sisters!

601
01:00:23,661 --> 01:00:26,330
Ernie, are you okay?
I came as soon as I heard.

602
01:00:27,081 --> 01:00:28,832
Why are you wearing a pink overcoat?

603
01:00:30,417 --> 01:00:33,711
Because April gave us the $1 ,200!

604
01:00:38,050 --> 01:00:40,052
So she just up and gave you the money?

605
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:42,138
You don't think
she heard about the auction?

606
01:00:42,221 --> 01:00:44,681
No. I didn't even tell her
about the auction

607
01:00:44,765 --> 01:00:46,850
until after she took me back.

608
01:00:46,934 --> 01:00:48,977
She just showed up at the factory

609
01:00:49,061 --> 01:00:51,730
took off her coat
and begged me to take her.

610
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:56,485
We made love in a way
I've only ever seen in nature films.

611
01:00:58,112 --> 01:00:59,279
I almost can't believe it.

612
01:00:59,363 --> 01:01:02,824
I'll be able to open another
restaurant, you're back with April,

613
01:01:02,908 --> 01:01:05,535
and you'll even be able to keep
that worthless factory.

614
01:01:06,370 --> 01:01:08,789
You know it's funny that
you call the factory worthless,

615
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:11,458
because, well, there's something

616
01:01:11,542 --> 01:01:14,127
I probably should have
mentioned before.

617
01:01:14,211 --> 01:01:18,173
Yeah? Well, I guess
I have something to confess, too.

618
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:21,718
Hey, isn't that Caesar's truck?

619
01:01:34,565 --> 01:01:36,900
-Oh, my God !
-Caesar! What happened?

620
01:01:36,984 --> 01:01:40,153
-Please, sir. He's not well.
-Try to think. Did you kill the mouse?

621
01:01:40,237 --> 01:01:42,948
What's that? Horse?

622
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:45,993
-Fiendish ! I won't eat it.
-No.

623
01:01:53,626 --> 01:01:54,877
How'd you find him? Where was he?

624
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:59,460
911 call. No voice. We could hear
screaming in the background.

625
01:02:00,007 --> 01:02:01,842
He was locked in a trunk in the attic.

626
01:02:01,926 --> 01:02:04,136
We'll call you if we get any leads.

627
01:02:26,825 --> 01:02:27,826
What's that?

628
01:02:31,747 --> 01:02:34,291
<i>Put that down. What is that?</i>

629
01:02:38,254 --> 01:02:39,421
<i>That tickles!</i>

630
01:02:45,344 --> 01:02:48,180
I don't think we're dealing
with an ordinary mouse.

631
01:03:00,484 --> 01:03:01,776
My kitchen!

632
01:03:09,368 --> 01:03:12,496
Looks like Caesar decided
to make himself a sandwich.

633
01:03:14,873 --> 01:03:18,877
Pickles, arugula and capers.

634
01:03:19,628 --> 01:03:21,671
He toasted the side with the cheese...

635
01:03:23,424 --> 01:03:27,924
but not the other side,
so the arugula doesn't wilt.

636
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:31,556
How did he know that?

637
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:43,736
-Hello.
-Hello.

638
01:04:20,314 --> 01:04:23,567
-Do you see him?
-Yeah, I see him.

639
01:04:30,824 --> 01:04:34,452
Lars, I'm stuck!
Get me out of here! I can't breathe.

640
01:04:34,536 --> 01:04:36,329
I'll get a flashlight.

641
01:04:37,456 --> 01:04:38,457
Hurry!

642
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:49,051
-Here, Ernie, I got it.
-I can see that.

643
01:04:52,596 --> 01:04:56,683
Hang on, Ernie.
The flashlight's broken.

644
01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:06,568
-Okay, Ernie. I got a light.
-Great.

645
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:14,535
Lars, do you smell something?

646
01:05:18,038 --> 01:05:19,247
Smells like gas.

647
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:45,876
What are you gonna do?

648
01:06:45,959 --> 01:06:49,212
I'm gonna kill that unspeakable thing
once and for all.

649
01:06:49,296 --> 01:06:52,007
-Come on, Ernie, no, no.. .
-Stand back, Lars!

650
01:06:52,090 --> 01:06:53,633
I'm a man on a mission!

651
01:06:53,717 --> 01:06:55,719
Look, this is how accidents happen !
Come on, Ernie.

652
01:06:57,179 --> 01:06:58,638
Put the gun down. Calm down. Come on.

653
01:06:59,056 --> 01:07:01,725
I'm gonna blow
his furry little head off,

654
01:07:01,808 --> 01:07:04,560
and I'm gonna splatter
his devious little mouse brain

655
01:07:04,645 --> 01:07:06,521
from here to kingdom come!

656
01:07:06,605 --> 01:07:08,565
No! You're gonna blow
a hole in the wall.

657
01:07:08,649 --> 01:07:10,192
-Come on !
-It'll be worth it!

658
01:07:10,275 --> 01:07:11,609
Think of the auction!

659
01:07:12,277 --> 01:07:13,486
For God's sakes!

660
01:07:13,570 --> 01:07:15,905
Think of the money, Ernie, the money!

661
01:07:15,989 --> 01:07:18,408
They're gonna cut our price
if there's bullet holes in the walls.

662
01:07:18,492 --> 01:07:21,328
-The money?
-Yeah, the money. The moolah. Yeah.

663
01:07:22,996 --> 01:07:25,665
-There he goes.
-Shoot! Shoot!

664
01:07:30,254 --> 01:07:34,049
Yes! You hit the piano!
You hit the piano.

665
01:07:34,132 --> 01:07:35,133
Look.

666
01:07:48,272 --> 01:07:51,108
What are you, crazy?
You're blowing the whole house up.

667
01:07:51,191 --> 01:07:53,193
The only thing you haven't hit so far
is the mouse!

668
01:07:53,277 --> 01:07:55,862
Would you give somebody else
a chance with that gun?

669
01:07:56,822 --> 01:07:58,240
You're doing a wonderful job.

670
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,001
You got him!

671
01:08:14,798 --> 01:08:16,007
Get him ! Get him ! Get him!

672
01:08:19,219 --> 01:08:21,304
See you in hell, mouse!

673
01:08:25,726 --> 01:08:26,977
Fire!

674
01:08:54,338 --> 01:08:56,256
God, I hate that mouse.

675
01:09:04,765 --> 01:09:07,058
<i>When you hear the beep, start talking.</i>

676
01:09:07,142 --> 01:09:11,642
<i>Mr. Smuntz,
this is Vinny from Zeppco calling.</i>

677
01:09:12,439 --> 01:09:15,150
<i>We waited at the square
for over an hour,</i>

678
01:09:15,233 --> 01:09:16,734
<i>but you never showed.</i>

679
01:09:16,818 --> 01:09:19,403
<i>We do not appreciate
being treated this way,</i>

680
01:09:19,488 --> 01:09:20,989
<i>especially after your brother</i>

681
01:09:21,073 --> 01:09:23,617
<i>already turned down
our generous offer.</i>

682
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:26,577
<i>Consider our proposal withdrawn.</i>

683
01:09:32,084 --> 01:09:35,253
-Betrayed by my own brother!
-Betrayal?

684
01:09:36,254 --> 01:09:37,964
Don't talk to me about betrayal.

685
01:09:38,048 --> 01:09:40,133
You should have told me
about that offer!

686
01:09:40,217 --> 01:09:44,638
-Half that factory is mine.
-And half is...

687
01:09:44,721 --> 01:09:49,016
And half is mine, including the half
that you tried to sell.

688
01:09:49,101 --> 01:09:52,104
Yes, and would have
if not for that stinking' bus!

689
01:09:52,187 --> 01:09:53,313
Bus?

690
01:09:53,397 --> 01:09:57,897
You can't leave well enough alone,
can you? You ruin everything!

691
01:09:58,026 --> 01:10:00,695
Me? You blame me for this?

692
01:10:00,779 --> 01:10:03,072
Look! You blew a hole in the floor!

693
01:10:03,156 --> 01:10:07,368
I distinctly remember
somebody yelling, "Shoot! Shoot!"

694
01:10:07,452 --> 01:10:10,079
Yeah. Well, you never
listened to me before!

695
01:10:10,163 --> 01:10:12,331
-And you know why?
-Why?

696
01:10:12,416 --> 01:10:15,544
Because I have no respect for you!

697
01:10:15,627 --> 01:10:19,839
Spending your whole life
in that stupid factory!

698
01:10:19,923 --> 01:10:21,382
It's tragic.

699
01:10:21,466 --> 01:10:24,302
You think I didn't have other things
I wanted to do with my life?

700
01:10:24,386 --> 01:10:26,805
You think I didn't have
ambitions of my own?

701
01:10:26,888 --> 01:10:30,349
-Come on. You loved string.
-I didn't love string!

702
01:10:30,434 --> 01:10:31,560
Well, you could have fooled me.

703
01:10:31,643 --> 01:10:33,019
You and Pop
were always huddled together

704
01:10:33,103 --> 01:10:34,938
running some piece of something
through your fingers.

705
01:10:35,647 --> 01:10:37,649
It didn't matter what I did.
I didn't even exist.

706
01:10:38,316 --> 01:10:40,985
I made him my special rack of lamb
for his 70th birthday.

707
01:10:41,069 --> 01:10:43,529
-Oh, no!
-Yes! You remember.

708
01:10:44,239 --> 01:10:48,076
I slaved over that meal,
making sure everything was perfect.

709
01:10:49,119 --> 01:10:51,079
Did he say,
"Thanks, Ernie, it was delicious"?

710
01:10:52,164 --> 01:10:53,290
No.

711
01:10:53,790 --> 01:10:56,501
He only noticed the string
I had tied it with.

712
01:10:59,546 --> 01:11:00,880
He was crazy!

713
01:11:02,841 --> 01:11:04,467
But I still wanted his approval.

714
01:11:05,719 --> 01:11:07,971
I didn't leave, Lars. I was cast out.

715
01:11:10,265 --> 01:11:12,141
There you go again!

716
01:11:12,225 --> 01:11:14,685
Blaming everything else but yourself.

717
01:11:14,770 --> 01:11:16,563
You think you're a success?

718
01:11:17,314 --> 01:11:21,814
Well, you... can't... cook!

719
01:11:23,153 --> 01:11:26,281
-I hate you !
-And I hate you!

720
01:11:26,364 --> 01:11:28,157
Not as much as I hate you!

721
01:11:28,241 --> 01:11:30,576
-Yeah?
-Yeah. Double. Double!

722
01:11:30,660 --> 01:11:34,914
Give me something !
I'm gonna brain you!

723
01:11:34,998 --> 01:11:35,999
Here it is!

724
01:11:36,082 --> 01:11:37,792
Yeah, give it to me, then ! Go ahead!

725
01:11:42,631 --> 01:11:43,965
You killed him!

726
01:11:47,469 --> 01:11:49,554
I didn't even know he was there!

727
01:11:49,638 --> 01:11:51,640
Let's think of all the trouble
we could've saved ourselves

728
01:11:51,723 --> 01:11:53,850
if we'd just thrown
fruit at him in the first place.

729
01:11:55,060 --> 01:11:57,020
Look! He's still breathing!

730
01:11:57,103 --> 01:11:58,479
-Well, kill him !
-Yeah!

731
01:11:58,563 --> 01:11:59,981
-Find a blunt object!
-Yeah...

732
01:12:00,899 --> 01:12:02,984
-There it is.
-There you go. Get that...

733
01:12:03,068 --> 01:12:04,527
-Let him have it.
-I...

734
01:12:04,611 --> 01:12:05,778
What the hell are you waiting for?

735
01:12:05,862 --> 01:12:08,573
-I can't just hit him with a shovel.
-Why not?

736
01:12:08,657 --> 01:12:11,076
Well, look at him. He's pathetic.

737
01:12:11,159 --> 01:12:13,452
Pathetic? He's Hitler with a tail.

738
01:12:13,537 --> 01:12:15,121
This is The Omen with whiskers.

739
01:12:15,205 --> 01:12:17,832
Nostradamus didn't
see this thing coming.

740
01:12:17,916 --> 01:12:21,753
-Well, he's a living thing.
-Not for long. Gimme that!

741
01:12:26,299 --> 01:12:27,550
I can't!

742
01:12:32,472 --> 01:12:34,474
Look at him just lying there.

743
01:12:34,558 --> 01:12:37,352
It just doesn't feel
very sportsmanlike.

744
01:12:37,435 --> 01:12:39,854
We gotta do something quick!
I think he's coming to.

745
01:12:47,279 --> 01:12:49,948
I forgot to put holes in the box.

746
01:13:10,844 --> 01:13:13,513
<i>Hasta la vista,</i>
you little rat bastard!

747
01:13:15,390 --> 01:13:17,266
Come on. We got work to do.

748
01:13:17,350 --> 01:13:19,185
Two days till payday, my friend.

749
01:14:13,031 --> 01:14:17,410
Perfect. It's the architectural
find of the decade. Let's go...

750
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:20,538
-Shall we?
-Yes.

751
01:14:30,090 --> 01:14:34,385
Well, it wasn't easy,
but we finally made it.

752
01:14:36,137 --> 01:14:39,682
Ernie, I want you to have something.

753
01:14:45,563 --> 01:14:47,606
Pop's lucky piece of string.

754
01:14:49,651 --> 01:14:50,818
I'm glad you kept it.

755
01:14:51,987 --> 01:14:55,573
He wanted us to share it.
I don't know why,

756
01:14:56,825 --> 01:15:00,620
but I think if he were here right now,
he'd be proud of you.

757
01:15:02,831 --> 01:15:04,666
I think he'd be proud of us.

758
01:15:10,422 --> 01:15:14,922
Hello, ladies. How magnificent!
Welcome!

759
01:15:15,468 --> 01:15:18,220
Lars, you remember Ingrid and Hilde.

760
01:15:18,304 --> 01:15:19,305
-Hello.
-Hello.

761
01:15:19,389 --> 01:15:22,850
Ladies, your hair
looks positively biblical!

762
01:15:24,310 --> 01:15:25,394
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

763
01:15:27,147 --> 01:15:30,608
Well, if you will excuse me,
I have to check on my crÃªpes.

764
01:15:36,114 --> 01:15:37,865
Keep the champagne coming, boys.

765
01:15:37,949 --> 01:15:39,700
The more they drink,
the higher they bid.

766
01:15:40,702 --> 01:15:42,662
You boys put on quite a shindig here.

767
01:15:42,746 --> 01:15:44,664
Thank you so much, Mr. Falko.

768
01:15:57,927 --> 01:16:00,763
You know, it would be very, very sad

769
01:16:01,389 --> 01:16:04,642
if you boys put on this auction
and nobody bid.

770
01:16:04,726 --> 01:16:07,478
That would put a real crimp
in our evening,

771
01:16:07,562 --> 01:16:09,438
but I don't think there's any danger
of that happening.

772
01:16:09,522 --> 01:16:13,025
I don't know. There's a lot
of Eurotrash scarfing up the shrimps.

773
01:16:14,527 --> 01:16:16,278
I tell you what.

774
01:16:16,362 --> 01:16:19,281
You call off the auction. Now.

775
01:16:20,408 --> 01:16:23,285
And I will write you a check

776
01:16:23,369 --> 01:16:25,412
for ten millions.

777
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:32,753
As insanely generous as that is,
I have to decline,

778
01:16:32,837 --> 01:16:35,923
but I do appreciate
your thoughtful concern.

779
01:16:36,007 --> 01:16:37,174
Enjoy the party.

780
01:16:38,551 --> 01:16:40,970
Are you interested in spooling?

781
01:16:41,846 --> 01:16:43,514
Sure. My father...

782
01:16:43,598 --> 01:16:47,143
I mean, my brother and I
own a string factory.

783
01:16:47,769 --> 01:16:48,770
Really?

784
01:16:51,314 --> 01:16:54,025
I would love
to see your factory sometime.

785
01:16:54,109 --> 01:16:55,110
Really?

786
01:16:58,321 --> 01:17:00,281
Hello, April. What a surprise.

787
01:17:00,365 --> 01:17:02,575
Just dropping by
for no reason, I suppose?

788
01:17:02,659 --> 01:17:06,496
Does a wife need a reason?
Are you entertaining?

789
01:17:06,579 --> 01:17:09,415
-Don't you mean "ex-wife"?
-Not quite yet.

790
01:17:12,127 --> 01:17:15,922
-Hakuna matata.
-This crÃªpe. <i>C'est magnifique.</i>

791
01:17:16,005 --> 01:17:19,258
-The raisins are a nice touch.
-They are good, aren't they?

792
01:17:20,927 --> 01:17:21,928
Raisins?

793
01:17:48,163 --> 01:17:50,623
Ladies and gentlemen,
please take your seats.

794
01:17:50,707 --> 01:17:52,583
We are about to start the auction.

795
01:17:56,087 --> 01:17:59,173
Lars, I don't know whether
to congratulate you or wish you luck.

796
01:17:59,257 --> 01:18:01,467
-Wish us luck!
-Hello, April.

797
01:18:02,177 --> 01:18:03,928
-Hello.
-Nice to see you again.

798
01:18:04,721 --> 01:18:08,808
-I didn't know you knew our lawyer.
-It's just an expression.

799
01:18:12,187 --> 01:18:13,438
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen,

800
01:18:13,521 --> 01:18:15,814
for joining us
for this momentous occasion,

801
01:18:15,899 --> 01:18:20,399
the auction of our one item
out for bid, the missing LaRue.

802
01:18:23,489 --> 01:18:24,615
Before we start,

803
01:18:24,699 --> 01:18:27,118
I would like to introduce you
to the very fortunate owner

804
01:18:27,202 --> 01:18:31,164
of this architectural wonder,
Mr. Ernest Smuntz.

805
01:18:45,386 --> 01:18:47,763
Thank you, all, for coming.

806
01:18:47,847 --> 01:18:52,347
When my father left this extraordinary
house to my brother Lars...

807
01:18:58,191 --> 01:18:59,775
and myself,

808
01:19:00,818 --> 01:19:05,318
we had no idea
what surprises were in store for us

809
01:19:05,657 --> 01:19:08,117
or what was going to happen next.

810
01:19:20,296 --> 01:19:21,338
When Quincy Thorpe

811
01:19:21,422 --> 01:19:24,675
of the Historical Society
told us of its value,

812
01:19:25,677 --> 01:19:26,678
you...

813
01:19:27,428 --> 01:19:29,388
you could have knocked...

814
01:19:31,516 --> 01:19:33,017
us over with a feather.

815
01:19:33,643 --> 01:19:34,644
We...

816
01:19:35,895 --> 01:19:37,479
didn't know what hit us!

817
01:19:41,651 --> 01:19:45,363
The renovation was exhausting,
but ultimately, rewarding.

818
01:19:45,446 --> 01:19:48,282
The house was in terrible disrepair,

819
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:51,827
but nothing that a few nails...

820
01:20:03,923 --> 01:20:06,967
and some old-fashioned
elbow grease couldn't fix.

821
01:20:07,051 --> 01:20:09,386
I'm sure the people are eager
to get to the bidding.

822
01:20:09,470 --> 01:20:10,846
What? The bidding?

823
01:20:10,930 --> 01:20:14,183
-The bidding !
-All right. Thank you.

824
01:20:14,267 --> 01:20:15,476
Thank you, Mr. Smuntz.

825
01:20:20,857 --> 01:20:22,984
No matter what happens, keep going.

826
01:20:30,533 --> 01:20:35,033
Built in 1876, the last LaRue
in existence has five bedrooms...

827
01:20:35,872 --> 01:20:37,248
-Did you see him?
-Yes!

828
01:20:37,332 --> 01:20:38,916
I thought so.

829
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,961
-He ate the string.
-What?

830
01:20:42,045 --> 01:20:44,839
The string. Pop's lucky string!

831
01:20:44,922 --> 01:20:46,798
The son of a bitch ate it!

832
01:20:46,883 --> 01:20:49,969
-Why didn't you tell me you saw him?
-I didn't, I found this.

833
01:20:51,721 --> 01:20:53,389
I told you,
you should have weighed him.

834
01:20:53,473 --> 01:20:54,474
I'm sorry.

835
01:20:56,559 --> 01:20:59,353
-Did you see where it went?
-No. But it can't have gone far.

836
01:21:00,730 --> 01:21:03,315
Well, shall we start
the bidding at $1 million?

837
01:21:04,192 --> 01:21:07,486
Now, we all know we're here
to bid on the missing LaRue.

838
01:21:07,570 --> 01:21:10,197
Shall we start the bidding
at $500,000?

839
01:21:11,824 --> 01:21:15,244
Very good. I have $500,000
from the gentleman from Japan.

840
01:21:15,328 --> 01:21:18,831
-Now can I hear a million?
-A million.

841
01:21:19,791 --> 01:21:21,459
I'll give you one and a half.

842
01:21:21,542 --> 01:21:24,419
I have $1 .5 million.
Will someone give me two?

843
01:21:25,838 --> 01:21:26,880
There he is!

844
01:21:27,799 --> 01:21:30,092
Ladies and gentleman,
I'd like to remind you,

845
01:21:30,176 --> 01:21:33,429
that all the carpets and tapestries
were woven by hand

846
01:21:33,513 --> 01:21:35,723
in an honest valley
in Northern Turkey.

847
01:21:36,808 --> 01:21:41,308
Now, can I have an advance on 1 .5?
May I have two?

848
01:21:42,814 --> 01:21:44,732
Can I have two, ladies and gentlemen?

849
01:21:45,733 --> 01:21:48,527
-Two million !
-I have $2 million.

850
01:21:50,613 --> 01:21:52,948
I have $2 million,
ladies and gentlemen.

851
01:21:53,032 --> 01:21:54,533
Can I have an advance?

852
01:21:55,243 --> 01:21:57,119
-Can I have an advance on $2 million?
-So beautiful.

853
01:21:58,371 --> 01:22:00,623
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to draw your attention

854
01:22:00,706 --> 01:22:02,165
to the Lincrusta details

855
01:22:02,250 --> 01:22:05,461
of the gold and silver-leafed
copper and pewter...

856
01:22:07,046 --> 01:22:08,964
Ladies and gentlemen,
can I have an advance?

857
01:22:09,632 --> 01:22:11,425
An advance on $2 million?

858
01:22:11,968 --> 01:22:13,469
May I hear $3 million?

859
01:22:13,553 --> 01:22:16,222
I have $3 million from the lady
from New York City.

860
01:22:16,848 --> 01:22:21,018
-What are you doing?
-Nothing!

861
01:22:21,102 --> 01:22:23,813
Get your hand
out of there immediately!

862
01:22:26,399 --> 01:22:29,235
Wait! Wait just a minute!

863
01:22:29,318 --> 01:22:32,571
-Wait!
-Now may I hear $4 million?

864
01:22:32,655 --> 01:22:34,573
Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah!

865
01:22:37,535 --> 01:22:38,536
Four million.

866
01:22:38,619 --> 01:22:40,495
Four million from the gentleman
in Japan.

867
01:22:41,581 --> 01:22:42,623
I got it!

868
01:22:48,212 --> 01:22:51,381
The Sheikh bids $5 million.
Thank you, sir. I have $5 million.

869
01:22:51,841 --> 01:22:53,133
Five million dollars.

870
01:22:54,969 --> 01:22:57,513
Can I have an advance on $5 million?

871
01:22:57,597 --> 01:22:59,682
Ladies and gentlemen, $5 million.

872
01:23:00,391 --> 01:23:01,683
Can I have an advance?

873
01:23:01,767 --> 01:23:04,269
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's the missing LaRue.

874
01:23:04,353 --> 01:23:07,397
The bidding stands at $5 million,
ladies and gentlemen.

875
01:23:07,482 --> 01:23:09,692
I've got you now, my little friend.

876
01:23:09,775 --> 01:23:11,359
Hold onto it, I'm gonna get it out.

877
01:23:14,405 --> 01:23:16,115
Five million dollars
for the missing LaRue.

878
01:23:16,532 --> 01:23:18,909
-Have you got it yet?
-I'm not sure.

879
01:23:19,702 --> 01:23:23,831
Ladies and gentlemen, will
someone give me $6 million?

880
01:23:23,915 --> 01:23:24,916
Six million.

881
01:23:24,999 --> 01:23:26,333
-Thank you, sir.
-I have $6 million.

882
01:23:26,417 --> 01:23:28,794
-Hilde, the spool is smoking !
-The bidding stands at $6 million.

883
01:23:29,462 --> 01:23:30,754
May I have an advance?

884
01:23:32,131 --> 01:23:33,674
An advance, ladies and gentlemen.

885
01:23:35,134 --> 01:23:37,344
Can I have an advance on six?

886
01:23:37,428 --> 01:23:40,347
The bidding stands at $6 million.

887
01:23:40,431 --> 01:23:42,933
-Seven million.
-$7 million. Thank you.

888
01:23:43,809 --> 01:23:45,352
Any advance on seven?

889
01:23:46,395 --> 01:23:49,356
Seven million dollars, I have seven.

890
01:23:55,446 --> 01:23:58,449
Keep her away from the walls!
The house is priceless!

891
01:23:58,533 --> 01:24:01,577
-Keep going !
-Can I have 7.5?

892
01:24:06,332 --> 01:24:07,875
I have $8 million.

893
01:24:07,959 --> 01:24:11,379
$8 million going once,
$8 million going twice...

894
01:24:11,462 --> 01:24:14,840
$8 million?
You should have taken the check!

895
01:24:14,924 --> 01:24:16,759
You shut up! You...

896
01:24:18,052 --> 01:24:21,096
-Ten millions!
-$10 million. Can I have 11 ?

897
01:24:21,180 --> 01:24:23,307
I have $11 million
from the gentleman from Japan.

898
01:24:24,433 --> 01:24:26,726
Twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen.

899
01:24:28,437 --> 01:24:31,648
-$16 million from Ernie Smuntz.
-No!

900
01:24:33,317 --> 01:24:35,652
-Seventeen million.
-$17 million. Thank you, sir.

901
01:24:35,736 --> 01:24:37,946
I have $17 million. Any advance on 17?

902
01:24:48,749 --> 01:24:49,750
Good idea.

903
01:24:54,630 --> 01:24:57,799
When I tell you to, turn it on
full blast. We'll flush him out.

904
01:25:00,928 --> 01:25:01,929
Now!

905
01:25:08,978 --> 01:25:10,229
$18 million.

906
01:25:10,313 --> 01:25:13,190
Eighteen million dollars from the lady
from New York City. Thank you.

907
01:25:13,274 --> 01:25:15,192
You don't have that kind of money.

908
01:25:18,863 --> 01:25:20,406
-Ernie?
-Not now.

909
01:25:26,245 --> 01:25:28,497
-Twenty millions.
-20 million. Thank you, Mr. Falko.

910
01:25:28,581 --> 01:25:30,374
I have 20. Can I hear 21 ?

911
01:25:50,311 --> 01:25:52,688
Twenty-one million dollars
from the gentleman from Japan.

912
01:25:57,318 --> 01:26:01,030
-Any advance on 21 ?
-22 million. That's my last offer.

913
01:26:05,201 --> 01:26:07,286
22 million going once...

914
01:26:10,414 --> 01:26:14,418
-Twenty-five millions.
-$25 million.

915
01:26:18,214 --> 01:26:21,550
Thank you, sir. $25 million.

916
01:26:22,593 --> 01:26:24,219
$25 million.

917
01:26:24,303 --> 01:26:28,598
The bidding stands at $25 million.
Do I have an advance?

918
01:26:30,351 --> 01:26:33,020
$25 million going once,

919
01:26:35,231 --> 01:26:37,191
$25 million going twice...

920
01:27:03,968 --> 01:27:05,844
Going... going...

921
01:27:10,516 --> 01:27:12,726
Hey! Don't go!

922
01:27:14,437 --> 01:27:17,064
The water was just a...

923
01:27:17,606 --> 01:27:22,106
a demonstration of how durable
a LaRue really is.

924
01:27:23,696 --> 01:27:24,822
How about that?

925
01:27:26,031 --> 01:27:29,826
Now you know
this house will last forever.

926
01:28:39,188 --> 01:28:40,856
Pop's lucky string.

927
01:28:41,607 --> 01:28:43,400
I guess we got him.

928
01:28:46,487 --> 01:28:48,780
Yeah, I guess we did.

929
01:30:17,119 --> 01:30:18,411
What was that?

930
01:30:31,675 --> 01:30:33,635
Lars! Look!

931
01:31:05,876 --> 01:31:07,669
It's string.

932
01:31:15,344 --> 01:31:16,595
It's cheese.

933
01:31:43,956 --> 01:31:46,083
And the entire factory
has been retrofitted

934
01:31:46,166 --> 01:31:49,377
to facilitate the manufacturing
of cheese-based products.

935
01:31:49,461 --> 01:31:50,545
I see.

936
01:31:50,629 --> 01:31:54,299
And over here we are developing
our new lactose-free line.

937
01:31:54,383 --> 01:31:56,510
-What is that?
-That's quality control.

938
01:31:57,678 --> 01:31:59,388
Here you go. Knock yourself out.

939
01:32:02,182 --> 01:32:04,976
No good? Otis, more curry.

940
01:32:05,060 --> 01:32:06,227
Okay. Try this one.

941
01:32:10,190 --> 01:32:13,526
It's mozzarella and herring.
You can taste the herring, right?

942
01:32:13,610 --> 01:32:16,863
I've also got a great idea
for caviar-brie swirl,

943
01:32:16,947 --> 01:32:19,407
and a peanut butter and jelly
provolone for the kids.

944
01:32:19,491 --> 01:32:22,285
But what I really want to talk to you
about is expansion and marketing.

945
01:32:22,369 --> 01:32:24,120
I think
you should be our spokesperson.

946
01:32:24,204 --> 01:32:26,706
I know some people who've used
a mouse as a spokesperson

947
01:32:26,790 --> 01:32:28,583
and it seemed to work out pretty well.

948
01:32:28,667 --> 01:32:29,751
You see, I want to turn this

949
01:32:29,835 --> 01:32:32,254
into the string cheese factory
of tomorrow...
