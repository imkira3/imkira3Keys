00:00:13,126 --> 00:00:14,993
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

3
00:00:15,861 --> 00:00:18,617
<i>Hello. This is Centurion Trust.</i>

4
00:00:18,697 --> 00:00:22,805
<i>We have a robbery in progress
at 23 Forsythe Place.</i>

5
00:00:22,885 --> 00:00:25,081
<i>So it's in progress right now?</i>

6
00:00:25,171 --> 00:00:29,062
<i>They're in the building. They're taking
hostages, so as soon as you can.</i>

7
00:00:29,142 --> 00:00:31,231
<i>Sir, are you in a safe place?</i>

8
00:00:31,711 --> 00:00:33,565
<i>Drop the phone.</i>

9
00:00:33,945 --> 00:00:35,501
<i>Sir?</i>

10
00:00:35,981 --> 00:00:37,548
<i>Hello?</i>

11
00:05:36,548 --> 00:05:39,351
All right, you're all set. Thank you.

12
00:06:19,423 --> 00:06:21,259
I hate sirens.

13
00:06:22,628 --> 00:06:25,629
You never know if it's your
own damn house on fire.

14
00:06:30,435 --> 00:06:32,236
Miss Reece?

15
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,676
I'm Chris Kirkham. Come on in.

16
00:06:43,364 --> 00:06:44,893
Hi.

17
00:06:45,269 --> 00:06:47,350
What can I do for you today?

18
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:51,011
I got another deposit for ya.

19
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,751
Okay.

20
00:06:53,259 --> 00:06:55,915
Thanks for waiting out there.
I appreciate your patience.

21
00:06:55,995 --> 00:07:00,286
We're just crazy after the holiday weekend.
It gets to be a bit of a circus around here.

22
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:04,235
- My resume.
- Great, thanks. You can take a seat.

23
00:07:09,841 --> 00:07:12,076
All right, let's see what we got here.

24
00:07:15,297 --> 00:07:16,840
And is that all?

25
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:19,787
Got any marshmallows?

26
00:07:20,887 --> 00:07:23,810
I'm sorry, marshmallows?

27
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:28,281
Yeah, there's a fire.
We can just skip the marshmallows.

28
00:07:28,361 --> 00:07:32,252
Maybe you might want to meet me
for happy hour when you close?

29
00:07:32,932 --> 00:07:35,189
You are too sweet.

30
00:07:36,069 --> 00:07:40,293
Sounds like somebody got started
a little bit early already on happy hour.

31
00:07:41,173 --> 00:07:43,264
I like to beat the crowds.

32
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:46,832
All righty, you are all set.

33
00:07:46,912 --> 00:07:48,739
Have yourself a nice day.

34
00:07:54,085 --> 00:07:58,003
Babe, just because it happened once,
doesn't mean every time I meet a woman...

35
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:00,794
- ...it's gonna happen again at the bar.
- Sorry, next window.

36
00:08:00,874 --> 00:08:04,717
- How may I help you today, ma'am?
- You may help me today.

37
00:08:05,297 --> 00:08:07,320
These bounced.

38
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,490
Insufficient funds.

39
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:14,795
That's quite impossible. I made
a big deposit yesterday, so fix it.

40
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:18,898
- Let me see what I can do.
- Yeah, you do that.

41
00:08:19,878 --> 00:08:22,914
You sure you want to brave it
out there, Detective?

42
00:08:25,383 --> 00:08:28,435
Hey, it looks like it's getting kind
of serious out there, you might...

43
00:08:28,515 --> 00:08:30,554
...make sure everybody gets out okay.

44
00:08:36,561 --> 00:08:39,885
Looks like you've worked with some
of the big guys. That's great.

45
00:08:39,965 --> 00:08:41,799
You probably know the drill.

46
00:08:44,636 --> 00:08:49,263
Okay, so a little bit of time
since your last position.

47
00:08:50,443 --> 00:08:52,276
What did you get up to there?

48
00:08:54,379 --> 00:08:56,069
I'm sorry, can you repeat the question?

49
00:08:56,149 --> 00:08:59,072
Just a little bit of time
between your last position...

50
00:08:59,152 --> 00:09:02,875
...what did you get up to there?
What happened?

51
00:09:02,955 --> 00:09:04,844
I traveled.

52
00:09:05,224 --> 00:09:09,414
I spent some time in Mexico with
my church group teaching English...

53
00:09:09,494 --> 00:09:13,686
...and fell so in love with it that I ended
up just staying there for about a year.

54
00:09:13,766 --> 00:09:15,922
- That's fantastic.
- Yeah. It's great.

55
00:09:16,002 --> 00:09:19,615
The only reason I came back was because
someone in my family got really sick...

56
00:09:19,695 --> 00:09:23,796
...so I'm looking for a job
to start as soon as possible.

57
00:09:23,876 --> 00:09:27,167
Fair enough. Okay, gotcha.
I hope they're okay.

58
00:09:27,847 --> 00:09:30,068
Okay, great, well, listen...

59
00:09:30,952 --> 00:09:33,673
...this checks out, we do a background check.

60
00:09:33,753 --> 00:09:35,675
It's just a formality,
but they're pretty thorough.

61
00:09:35,755 --> 00:09:38,478
- You expect any red flags there? Any issues?
- No.

62
00:09:38,558 --> 00:09:43,182
So what happens is, you guys charge a fucking
fee for every single check that I bounced.

63
00:09:43,262 --> 00:09:46,285
I get charged. Okay?

64
00:09:46,365 --> 00:09:48,570
So then what happens is...
hold on. Let me talk.

65
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:53,995
What happens is I get charged a fee for
every fucking check here that bounced...

66
00:09:54,075 --> 00:09:57,408
...then the people that I paid,
they charge me...

67
00:09:57,488 --> 00:10:00,233
...and the fucking circus
happens all over again.

68
00:10:00,313 --> 00:10:03,030
- Yes, ma'am. I understand.
- I really don't think you do understand...

69
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:05,671
...because now that my account's
in the red, what?

70
00:10:05,751 --> 00:10:09,542
You're going to charge me another penalty?
Yeah, that's what you guys fucking do.

71
00:10:09,622 --> 00:10:11,844
- So let me ask you something.
- Okay.

72
00:10:11,924 --> 00:10:14,957
When the bank fucks up,
who pays Redd's penalties?

73
00:10:15,037 --> 00:10:19,686
- Ma'am, if you would watch your language...
- You charge me for every goddamn mistake.

74
00:10:19,766 --> 00:10:22,688
How does anybody get ahead in fucking life?
You know what I mean?

75
00:10:22,768 --> 00:10:25,959
- Let me ask you a fucking question, Mary.
- Yes?

76
00:10:26,239 --> 00:10:29,040
Who pays when you make a fucking mistake?

77
00:11:00,238 --> 00:11:03,774
- How'd the marshmallow line work for you?
- Fuck you.

78
00:11:10,381 --> 00:11:12,839
Well, listen, that leaves just timing.

79
00:11:13,319 --> 00:11:16,598
What's your timeline like?
The truth is we have...

80
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:21,747
...three tellers spots open now.
I can't seem to keep them, so...

81
00:11:21,827 --> 00:11:23,608
Can I ask why?

82
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:28,087
- If you don't mind me asking.
- No, I understand.

83
00:11:28,668 --> 00:11:30,536
I still want the job.

84
00:11:31,537 --> 00:11:35,029
I mean, it's silly, but since you asked...

85
00:11:35,109 --> 00:11:38,323
...it's an old building and...

86
00:11:39,103 --> 00:11:42,023
...some people get spooked
in here, and they...

87
00:11:42,103 --> 00:11:44,304
...think they hear and see things.

88
00:11:44,884 --> 00:11:47,680
And so, I swear to God, it's just...

89
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,571
...people talking and getting in their head.

90
00:11:49,651 --> 00:11:52,145
- Please? Curb your language.
- Yes. Please. Excuse me.

91
00:11:52,225 --> 00:11:55,326
- If you'll give me your social security...
- Hold on. Hold on.

92
00:11:56,996 --> 00:11:59,018
- Let me talk to a manager.
- Absolutely.

93
00:11:59,098 --> 00:12:01,420
Let's do that. Let's get
a fucking manager around here.

94
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,607
There's a fucking manager here.
There's gotta be some fucking manager here.

95
00:12:04,687 --> 00:12:06,842
Okay. What seems to be the issue?

96
00:12:06,972 --> 00:12:09,262
She had these checks returned.
I've looked her up.

97
00:12:09,342 --> 00:12:12,245
Are you the manager
or just a financial service specialist?

98
00:12:12,325 --> 00:12:16,502
I am Susan, the head teller,
and I'm just trying to see...

99
00:12:16,582 --> 00:12:19,071
- ...if I can help you here, okay?
- The head teller?

100
00:12:19,151 --> 00:12:21,647
Oh, great, here comes the cavalry.

101
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:24,150
I can't explain it, but...

102
00:12:25,804 --> 00:12:29,800
...in fairness, it's probably worth
telling you that in advance, but...

103
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,882
...I don't make anything of it.

104
00:12:32,832 --> 00:12:35,770
You know, do you spook easily, Miss Reece?

105
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:39,107
- No, sir. Not me.
- Okay, good. That settles that.

106
00:12:39,187 --> 00:12:41,651
The only thing that spooks is a bad loan.

107
00:12:43,725 --> 00:12:46,015
- That's funny.
- I'm perfectly calm.

108
00:12:46,145 --> 00:12:49,368
- So you checked the record?
- I just want my fucking money.

109
00:12:49,448 --> 00:12:53,189
Okay, ma'am, you don't have
an account with us.

110
00:12:54,419 --> 00:12:57,943
Well, that's a fucking mistake. Check again.

111
00:12:58,023 --> 00:13:01,214
- Is there a problem?
- No. There's no problem at all actually.

112
00:13:01,294 --> 00:13:05,897
- Hey, your shitty life is not my problem.
- Sir, can you let us handle this, sir?

113
00:13:13,903 --> 00:13:16,173
I'm gonna need you to step outside.

114
00:13:27,318 --> 00:13:30,843
Where's the fire? Is it close? Are we safe?

115
00:13:30,923 --> 00:13:33,346
We just need everybody to stay inside.

116
00:13:34,226 --> 00:13:37,283
- Ma'am, please.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey. Don't touch me.

117
00:13:37,363 --> 00:13:40,319
Get her the fuck out of here.
Please, do something about this.

118
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,401
- Keep your hands off me.
- I need you to step outside with me.

119
00:13:53,644 --> 00:13:55,702
Hands behind your head.

120
00:13:56,682 --> 00:14:01,447
Unit 4919, I'm at Centurion Trust Bank.
23 Forsythe Street. I've got a 29 in progress.

121
00:14:03,969 --> 00:14:05,596
Get down.

122
00:14:21,205 --> 00:14:22,765
Fuck that.

123
00:14:23,175 --> 00:14:25,397
Back up, now!

124
00:14:25,477 --> 00:14:28,545
Yeah, that's right. Give me your phone.
Give me your phone.

125
00:14:42,293 --> 00:14:45,186
Eyes to me. Back, back, back, back.

126
00:14:45,266 --> 00:14:47,100
Back up!

127
00:14:47,466 --> 00:14:49,724
Keep your eyes on me at all times.

128
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:54,676
<i>Unit 4919, is the situation under control?</i>

129
00:14:55,841 --> 00:14:58,674
You say code 21, this ends bad for everybody.

130
00:15:04,382 --> 00:15:06,272
Situation under control.

131
00:15:07,619 --> 00:15:11,275
- Good work.
- <i>Unit 4919, please repeat.</i>

132
00:15:17,496 --> 00:15:20,965
Yes, this is 4919.

133
00:15:21,467 --> 00:15:25,331
Situation under control. Took care of it.

134
00:15:31,008 --> 00:15:34,077
Let's check it out real quick.
I'll be right back.

135
00:15:41,219 --> 00:15:46,278
<i>This is Centurion Trust, we have
a robbery in progress at 23 Forsythe.</i>

136
00:15:46,358 --> 00:15:48,647
<i>Could you please send the police.</i>

137
00:15:48,827 --> 00:15:50,716
<i>In progress right now.</i>

138
00:15:50,796 --> 00:15:54,087
<i>They're taking hostages,
so as soon as you can.</i>

139
00:15:55,547 --> 00:15:58,091
Out now. Safety deposit vault. Let's go.

140
00:15:58,171 --> 00:16:01,072
You want to survive today?
Let's go. Let's go.

141
00:16:06,544 --> 00:16:08,776
Are you sure you want to do this, honey?

142
00:16:10,415 --> 00:16:14,139
Okay, I did a background
check too, Mr. Kirkham.

143
00:16:14,219 --> 00:16:16,108
You live in a nice house
with a white picket fence,

144
00:16:16,188 --> 00:16:18,644
you've got two boys, 7 and 8,
and another on the way.

145
00:16:18,724 --> 00:16:21,125
You make a decent amount of money,
and you've got a pretty enough wife...

146
00:16:21,205 --> 00:16:24,103
- ...so you have no reason to play hero.
- Okay.

147
00:16:24,463 --> 00:16:26,982
- I need you to work with me. Okay?
- Okay. Okay.

148
00:16:27,062 --> 00:16:29,702
- All right?
- Okay, understood.

149
00:16:30,602 --> 00:16:34,026
What are you doing? What are you doing?

150
00:16:34,106 --> 00:16:36,982
- We said don't hurt anybody.
- You fucking hurt somebody.

151
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:40,283
- I did it to save you.
- I know, thanks. Awesome.

152
00:16:41,013 --> 00:16:44,770
- Using fucking brass knuckles like that.
- I don't have time to be a good person.

153
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:47,686
- We're either doing this or we're not. Chill.
- We just don't hurt anybody, okay?

154
00:16:47,766 --> 00:16:50,761
- Well...
- That's what... that's what we agreed.

155
00:16:51,389 --> 00:16:53,880
- All right?
- All right. Fine.

156
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,078
Fine.

157
00:16:56,328 --> 00:16:59,101
- I need you to tell them to remain calm.
- Understood.

158
00:16:59,181 --> 00:17:02,721
You remain calm,
the orders are clear, do nothing.

159
00:17:02,801 --> 00:17:05,324
Sit quietly. Say your prayers in your head.

160
00:17:05,404 --> 00:17:08,993
- Do you understand? Okay? Thank you.
- Understood. Okay.

161
00:17:18,883 --> 00:17:22,107
- Sir, please.
- Don't talk. Do it.

162
00:17:22,187 --> 00:17:24,255
It's gonna be okay, Mary.

163
00:17:30,261 --> 00:17:32,283
Good girl. Come on.

164
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:36,794
Come on, let's go. Come on.

165
00:17:39,121 --> 00:17:41,168
Come on. Come on.

166
00:17:53,451 --> 00:17:55,719
You want me to do this or not?

167
00:17:59,923 --> 00:18:02,548
You're okay. Don't be nervous.

168
00:18:02,928 --> 00:18:06,369
Why so nervous? Why so nervous?

169
00:18:06,532 --> 00:18:09,439
Good girl. Good girls.

170
00:18:19,178 --> 00:18:20,244
Stop.

171
00:18:31,589 --> 00:18:33,258
Just stop.

172
00:18:33,338 --> 00:18:36,383
Get the code. You're doing very well.

173
00:18:38,563 --> 00:18:41,829
Now, stop being so self indulgent,
or I kill the cop.

174
00:18:48,372 --> 00:18:52,643
Sir, stay still. Stay still.
Stay still. Fuck.

175
00:19:27,744 --> 00:19:30,169
Goddammit. Do it right.

176
00:19:30,249 --> 00:19:33,238
Okay. Okay. Okay.

177
00:19:33,618 --> 00:19:35,907
What is so fucking difficult?

178
00:19:35,987 --> 00:19:38,388
Come on. Come on. Come on.

179
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:47,753
Where the fuck is the rest of the money?
Are you telling me there's all there is?

180
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:50,067
You're fucking useless.

181
00:19:58,575 --> 00:20:01,010
- You got it?
- Come on, let's go!

182
00:20:02,531 --> 00:20:05,814
- How much?
- Maybe a little over $70,000.

183
00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:09,541
I mean, there might be $5,000
or $10,000 in the teller's station.

184
00:20:09,621 --> 00:20:12,999
- How much? What'd he say?
- 70 grand.

185
00:20:13,826 --> 00:20:15,414
Clear.

186
00:20:15,494 --> 00:20:19,117
All right, that's not enough. Let's go.
Come on, Vee, let's get out of here.

187
00:20:19,197 --> 00:20:22,420
What do you mean? Are you fucking kidding?

188
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:26,558
- Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.
- What? Let's go? Fucking leave?

189
00:20:26,638 --> 00:20:29,994
We're not gonna leave.
You're not fucking going anywhere.

190
00:20:30,074 --> 00:20:33,606
Come on, we came here for him.
We came here to do this for him...

191
00:20:33,686 --> 00:20:36,441
...and we're not leaving until we do it.
Do you understand that?

192
00:20:36,521 --> 00:20:38,471
- Yes, I understand.
- Okay, then what's the problem?

193
00:20:38,551 --> 00:20:42,425
Does that look like half a million
dollars to you? No. 70 grand.

194
00:20:42,505 --> 00:20:45,410
Should we just go and rob some more fucking
banks or should we just finish this out?

195
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:48,847
- We leave while we still can.
- We're not leaving and going anywhere.

196
00:20:49,927 --> 00:20:52,176
Let go. Let go.

197
00:20:52,256 --> 00:20:54,498
Look at me. Look at me.
Let's get out of here, okay?

198
00:20:55,733 --> 00:20:59,625
Don't worry, I want to kill you too, bitch.
You've always been a fucking bitch.

199
00:20:59,705 --> 00:21:02,265
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

200
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:05,962
Let's go. All that we planned out.

201
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,869
Drop your fucking gun.

202
00:21:10,949 --> 00:21:14,506
I've got brothers I've got to answer to.
We ain't going anywhere without the money.

203
00:21:14,586 --> 00:21:17,074
You put your gun down, motherfucker.

204
00:21:18,857 --> 00:21:21,313
Please, please, please.

205
00:21:21,393 --> 00:21:24,606
Please, can we not leave without the money?
I hate when you get stubborn like this.

206
00:21:24,686 --> 00:21:27,552
Leah, this isn't a military op, okay?

207
00:21:27,632 --> 00:21:30,845
- We're not leaving without the money.
- Vee, Vee, look at me. There's no money.

208
00:21:30,925 --> 00:21:34,093
- It's a fucking bank. There's always money.
- Then where's the money?

209
00:21:34,173 --> 00:21:36,861
If you know where the money is,
show me where the money is.

210
00:21:36,941 --> 00:21:39,342
Look, I can tell you where the money is.

211
00:21:51,822 --> 00:21:55,480
- I can help you.
- Who the fuck are you?

212
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:59,918
I'm the assistant manager.
I know this bank inside and out.

213
00:21:59,998 --> 00:22:03,055
First, you're going to
want to disable the alarm.

214
00:22:03,835 --> 00:22:07,327
- What alarm?
- Behind the tellers' windows.

215
00:22:08,907 --> 00:22:12,475
It was set off because you
didn't follow protocol.

216
00:22:15,412 --> 00:22:17,837
You have three minutes, maybe four.

217
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:22,941
- Then what? What happens?
- Till the police know that you're here.

218
00:22:23,021 --> 00:22:24,580
- Can you please take this bag off.
- No.

219
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:28,246
- I'm having trouble. I have asthma.
- It doesn't matter. Tell me more.

220
00:22:28,326 --> 00:22:33,327
Look, at 5:20, all transactions
need to be reconciled...

221
00:22:33,407 --> 00:22:35,654
...and synced with the database.

222
00:22:35,734 --> 00:22:38,376
We need to verify the cash...

223
00:22:38,456 --> 00:22:41,326
...lock all the drawers in the safe
and the manager needs to type his pin in.

224
00:22:41,406 --> 00:22:45,305
If that doesn't happen,
the alarm is triggered at exactly 5:20.

225
00:22:47,144 --> 00:22:51,414
Now, the manager can do it or me.

226
00:22:55,286 --> 00:22:57,110
Take the bag off.

227
00:22:58,290 --> 00:22:59,799
Who the fuck are you?

228
00:23:01,459 --> 00:23:04,214
I can... I can help you.

229
00:23:06,897 --> 00:23:11,301
You just have to promise me
that no one else is going to get hurt.

230
00:23:15,372 --> 00:23:17,595
No, you listen to me, all right?

231
00:23:18,145 --> 00:23:22,622
You do as we say, we won't hurt you
and that's it. There's no negotiating here.

232
00:23:23,781 --> 00:23:28,818
The signal is sent, the police come.
It's as simple as that. No one wins.

233
00:23:32,455 --> 00:23:35,090
- That's true.
- Hold on.

234
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,852
All right, no one's going to get hurt, okay?

235
00:23:39,932 --> 00:23:42,571
Get the pin. Let's do this.

236
00:23:43,701 --> 00:23:45,160
Leah.

237
00:24:19,236 --> 00:24:22,495
- So we good?
- Yeah. Yeah, we're good.

238
00:24:24,175 --> 00:24:26,498
Where's the rest of the money?

239
00:24:26,578 --> 00:24:30,819
It's down below. That's where... that's
where the real money is, in the old vault.

240
00:24:30,899 --> 00:24:33,389
- You can get in there?
- It's a private vault.

241
00:24:33,469 --> 00:24:37,209
It's part of the old bank.
We just house it. It's antiquated.

242
00:24:37,289 --> 00:24:39,184
It's not even on the grid.

243
00:24:39,264 --> 00:24:42,114
- We're not prepared for this.
- We're in pretty good shape, I gotta say.

244
00:24:42,194 --> 00:24:44,985
We got the cobalt drill bits,
we got the welder for the back way out.

245
00:24:45,065 --> 00:24:49,321
- Perfect. Then we're going in.
- Depends on the vault. How old?

246
00:24:50,101 --> 00:24:52,590
It's 60, 70 years.

247
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:54,726
- We don't have time.
- Bullshit.

248
00:24:54,806 --> 00:24:59,731
The whole fucking warehouse is up in flames,
everything is locked up, we got time.

249
00:24:59,811 --> 00:25:01,833
How much money's in it?

250
00:25:01,913 --> 00:25:03,869
$6 million, cash.

251
00:25:04,149 --> 00:25:07,396
- $6 million?
- Bullshit.

252
00:25:08,586 --> 00:25:13,645
No, it's there. The end of
the basement hall, there's a door.

253
00:25:14,125 --> 00:25:17,036
The key is... here, this is it.

254
00:25:18,596 --> 00:25:20,419
The key.

255
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:22,688
We're in.

256
00:25:23,208 --> 00:25:27,125
<i>The fire we set is going to keep those
cops busy. I'll go down with Kramer.</i>

257
00:25:27,205 --> 00:25:31,596
<i>I'm gonna check it out and make sure
we're good. I'll be back in five minutes.</i>

258
00:25:31,676 --> 00:25:34,766
<i>Time me. You stay up here,
and you keep a lookout...</i>

259
00:25:34,846 --> 00:25:38,002
<i>...and then Michael goes down next
to cut the hole in the water main.</i>

260
00:25:38,082 --> 00:25:40,572
They're not on to us.
Haven't heard anything. We're good.

261
00:25:40,652 --> 00:25:43,575
<i>Supervise the whole operation
from up on high.</i>

262
00:25:43,655 --> 00:25:48,379
<i>Please watch Mr. assistant bank manager,
make sure Cyrus doesn't fucking kill anybody.</i>

263
00:25:48,459 --> 00:25:53,204
<i>In 30 minutes, we will slip out
the back door with $6 million cash.</i>

264
00:25:53,284 --> 00:25:55,548
<i>It's fucking perfect.</i>

265
00:27:06,069 --> 00:27:10,273
<i>Vee, if you can hear me, look at
the cameras behind you. 4 o'clock.</i>

266
00:27:19,116 --> 00:27:20,996
All right.

267
00:27:22,953 --> 00:27:25,621
- Let's go.
- Yeah, right.

268
00:27:31,662 --> 00:27:34,183
I can tell you're a decent man.

269
00:27:35,099 --> 00:27:36,911
You don't know me.

270
00:27:38,302 --> 00:27:39,858
Please, sir.

271
00:27:39,938 --> 00:27:42,593
- Stop talking.
- Please?

272
00:27:42,673 --> 00:27:45,029
- Shut up, let me handle this.
- Sir, stop talking.

273
00:27:45,109 --> 00:27:49,199
If you would've done your job from the
beginning, we wouldn't be in this shit show.

274
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,536
- Yeah, come on, buddy, let us go.
- Sir, let me handle this.

275
00:27:51,616 --> 00:27:53,538
Let me negotiate.
You had a chance to handle this.

276
00:27:53,618 --> 00:27:56,742
- Just let us all go.
- Stop talking. Stop talking.

277
00:27:56,822 --> 00:28:00,190
Stop fucking talking! Shut up!

278
00:28:24,047 --> 00:28:25,904
What are you gonna do? What are you gonna do?

279
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:27,722
Congratulations.

280
00:28:27,802 --> 00:28:30,274
Yeah, what? What?

281
00:28:30,354 --> 00:28:34,224
You are the first hostage
who's going to fucking die today.

282
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,108
I have to use the restroom.

283
00:28:56,013 --> 00:29:00,695
I have to use the restroom, and I prefer
not going right here in front of everyone.

284
00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:11,063
Shit. Is that it?

285
00:29:11,143 --> 00:29:12,728
Yeah.

286
00:29:19,269 --> 00:29:22,827
- How the fuck are you getting in there?
- It's a combo lock. It's nothing ugly.

287
00:29:22,907 --> 00:29:24,130
Really?

288
00:29:26,276 --> 00:29:28,032
How long?

289
00:29:28,112 --> 00:29:30,835
- 20 minutes.
- Here.

290
00:29:30,915 --> 00:29:33,204
- Stay on two.
- My favorite.

291
00:29:33,284 --> 00:29:34,818
Start.

292
00:29:39,691 --> 00:29:41,992
X marks the spot.

293
00:29:48,565 --> 00:29:50,087
Fuck.

294
00:29:50,467 --> 00:29:52,454
What the fuck is that?

295
00:30:03,246 --> 00:30:05,648
It's got to be a power surge or something.

296
00:30:18,161 --> 00:30:19,962
Watch him.

297
00:30:47,157 --> 00:30:49,806
<i>Unit 4919, what's your status?</i>

298
00:30:50,895 --> 00:30:54,156
<i>Unit 4919, are you still at 23-47?</i>

299
00:31:01,304 --> 00:31:03,173
Can you untie me?

300
00:31:06,509 --> 00:31:09,712
Can you please take the bag off my head?

301
00:31:12,415 --> 00:31:14,239
Don't move.

302
00:31:14,619 --> 00:31:16,452
You stay right there.

303
00:31:20,023 --> 00:31:21,790
Let's go.

304
00:31:26,396 --> 00:31:28,586
I can't pee when you're
pacing outside like that.

305
00:31:28,666 --> 00:31:30,955
What's that? Let's go. Let's hurry up.

306
00:31:31,035 --> 00:31:33,618
You're making me nervous. I can't pee.

307
00:31:33,698 --> 00:31:34,926
You what?

308
00:31:35,006 --> 00:31:40,285
I can't pee when you're pacing right
outside of the door like that. Please?

309
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:54,932
I couldn't either.

310
00:31:57,161 --> 00:31:58,927
What's your name?

311
00:32:01,931 --> 00:32:03,499
Susan.

312
00:32:17,981 --> 00:32:19,989
Who's in charge?

313
00:32:21,351 --> 00:32:23,018
Who do you think?

314
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:28,858
That's the problem.
It doesn't seem like anyone's in charge.

315
00:32:33,196 --> 00:32:34,998
Stop talking.

316
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,731
Oh, fuck. You fuck.

317
00:33:53,311 --> 00:33:56,970
I know that your hand
is being forced right now...

318
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:03,227
...and I don't know by who or why.

319
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:09,259
I don't hear you pissing in there.

320
00:34:18,068 --> 00:34:20,569
- You got any sisters?
- Yeah.

321
00:34:21,049 --> 00:34:23,294
Yeah? You love them?

322
00:34:23,674 --> 00:34:25,930
Yeah. I do.

323
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:29,730
- That's good.
- Are those your sisters out there?

324
00:34:33,016 --> 00:34:36,927
You're not like the others.
You don't want to hurt people.

325
00:34:38,206 --> 00:34:42,272
I know you tried to help that policeman.

326
00:34:43,828 --> 00:34:46,496
I know you're not a bad person.

327
00:34:50,233 --> 00:34:54,493
You know, sometimes you just don't
want to piss off the wrong people...

328
00:34:55,573 --> 00:34:57,761
...no matter what you're trying to do.

329
00:35:05,915 --> 00:35:07,717
What happened?

330
00:35:09,819 --> 00:35:12,311
I stiffed the wrong guys, Susan.

331
00:35:13,591 --> 00:35:15,658
And I owe them a lot of money.

332
00:35:21,731 --> 00:35:23,573
So we're here...

333
00:35:25,546 --> 00:35:28,972
...and my sisters...
my sisters are helping me.

334
00:35:32,742 --> 00:35:34,566
Let's go.

335
00:35:35,346 --> 00:35:37,236
I don't hear any piss.

336
00:35:38,316 --> 00:35:40,158
I can't pee.

337
00:35:52,529 --> 00:35:54,731
Susan, we're not here to hurt anybody.

338
00:35:59,802 --> 00:36:01,393
All right?

339
00:36:02,773 --> 00:36:04,574
Let's go.

340
00:36:09,279 --> 00:36:11,481
You need to see a doctor.

341
00:36:14,084 --> 00:36:16,174
Please, let me...

342
00:36:17,254 --> 00:36:18,776
Please?

343
00:36:19,556 --> 00:36:21,358
I want to help you.

344
00:36:24,544 --> 00:36:26,585
You're a good person.

345
00:36:28,065 --> 00:36:31,090
I know it's not in your heart
to do this, please?

346
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:35,226
You have my word
you're gonna go home to your family.

347
00:36:35,306 --> 00:36:37,107
I promise you.

348
00:36:40,777 --> 00:36:42,265
Put that on.

349
00:36:47,484 --> 00:36:49,319
All right, let's move.

350
00:36:53,523 --> 00:36:58,370
Move, move, move. Right there. Right there.
Right there. Right there. Go, go, go.

351
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:01,519
What's going on?
Why are you not cutting the pipe?

352
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:02,687
I'm going right now.

353
00:37:02,767 --> 00:37:05,386
We need to make sure
that we have a way out of here.

354
00:37:05,466 --> 00:37:07,270
I'm doing it.

355
00:37:22,418 --> 00:37:25,421
Let's go. Come on. Let's go.

356
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:29,813
What's up?

357
00:37:29,893 --> 00:37:32,483
I'm shaken up right now. Like, do
you think we've overlooked somebody?

358
00:37:32,563 --> 00:37:34,986
Like there's someone in the back I think.

359
00:37:35,066 --> 00:37:37,838
You gotta... Leah says we're falling behind.

360
00:37:37,918 --> 00:37:40,755
I don't fucking care. You hear what I said?

361
00:37:40,835 --> 00:37:44,529
Yeah, I heard you. I don't know.

362
00:37:44,609 --> 00:37:47,158
What the fuck do you think,
we're just gonna like slip out the back...

363
00:37:47,238 --> 00:37:50,762
...with a fucking pile of money, and
everything's just gonna be like dandy again?

364
00:37:50,982 --> 00:37:53,404
You'll buy some big fucking
mansion in Stillwood Park...

365
00:37:53,484 --> 00:37:57,108
...and maybe we'll get some daisies
and lay them on Mama's grave.

366
00:37:57,188 --> 00:38:00,011
And we'll be a big happy family again.

367
00:38:00,091 --> 00:38:04,348
Come on, Aaron. You know I fucking love
Leah to death, but you know the minute...

368
00:38:04,428 --> 00:38:07,919
...the minute this shit's done, she's out.
Like always. She's gonna be out.

369
00:38:07,999 --> 00:38:11,222
As soon as we fucking do this,
she's gonna be gone.

370
00:38:11,302 --> 00:38:13,691
I know it. You know it.

371
00:38:13,771 --> 00:38:15,420
I don't know it.

372
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:18,541
Who cares?

373
00:39:07,157 --> 00:39:10,027
Hey. So what's up?

374
00:39:11,395 --> 00:39:13,238
- He's doing well.
- Oh, yeah?

375
00:39:13,318 --> 00:39:15,031
He's fine.

376
00:41:19,188 --> 00:41:20,690
Kramer?

377
00:41:35,971 --> 00:41:37,473
Vee?

378
00:41:52,705 --> 00:41:56,259
What's he looking at?
What the fuck are you looking at?

379
00:42:02,098 --> 00:42:05,135
Get the fuck upstairs with the others.

380
00:42:24,653 --> 00:42:26,177
<i>Vee?</i>

381
00:42:27,157 --> 00:42:28,959
There's people down here.

382
00:42:32,662 --> 00:42:34,550
- Come on, dude.
- Kramer.

383
00:42:36,366 --> 00:42:39,056
- Piece of shit.
- Give it to me.

384
00:42:39,136 --> 00:42:41,793
Kramer? Can you hear me?

385
00:42:43,273 --> 00:42:45,446
- Kramer, you all right?
- There's no one down there.

386
00:42:45,526 --> 00:42:49,512
<i>Hey, we can actually see you
on the monitor, but what are you staring?</i>

387
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:03,291
- What the fuck is he doing?
- I don't know, he's just like...

388
00:43:03,595 --> 00:43:06,796
...what is he looking at?
Is he looking out in the hall?

389
00:43:09,398 --> 00:43:11,201
<i>There's people.</i>

390
00:43:20,342 --> 00:43:23,199
What the fuck? It keeps doing that.
Was it doing that up here?

391
00:43:23,279 --> 00:43:25,501
It was doing that down there.

392
00:43:48,787 --> 00:43:50,836
Did you just fucking see that?

393
00:43:56,611 --> 00:43:58,881
What the fuck just happened?

394
00:44:03,886 --> 00:44:06,408
Is there someone down there?
Is there someone down there?

395
00:44:06,488 --> 00:44:09,499
Have you seen somebody when I wasn't
up here? Was there someone down there?

396
00:44:09,579 --> 00:44:12,862
- I'm going down there. Fucking wake up!
- No one's down there.

397
00:44:16,999 --> 00:44:19,690
Michael, we need you
in the lobby with the keys.

398
00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:21,948
Cyrus, count the hostages.

399
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:03,313
Michael, we need you up here
with the keys to the basement.

400
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:10,420
<i>Cyrus, count the hostages.</i>

401
00:45:14,423 --> 00:45:16,292
Hold on.

402
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:23,464
The fucking door's locked.

403
00:45:28,905 --> 00:45:30,373
Come on.

404
00:48:52,741 --> 00:48:54,243
Michael?

405
00:49:10,793 --> 00:49:13,794
No lies. Short answers.

406
00:49:14,998 --> 00:49:17,017
What the fuck is down there?

407
00:49:17,801 --> 00:49:19,690
I swear to God I don't know.

408
00:49:20,270 --> 00:49:22,125
- Did you set us up?
- No.

409
00:49:22,205 --> 00:49:23,894
- You fucking set us up.
- No.

410
00:49:23,974 --> 00:49:27,264
Who the fuck is down there?
Do not fucking lie to me.

411
00:49:27,344 --> 00:49:29,900
Please, I don't want you
to get upset and hurt anyone.

412
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:33,215
You promised that you wouldn't
hurt anyone if I helped you.

413
00:49:36,385 --> 00:49:38,710
- You're lying.
- No.

414
00:49:39,970 --> 00:49:42,125
- You're lying.
- No.

415
00:49:48,597 --> 00:49:50,467
Who's calling?

416
00:49:53,736 --> 00:49:55,626
I don't know.

417
00:49:56,406 --> 00:49:57,907
Okay.

418
00:50:07,183 --> 00:50:09,098
Make them go away.

419
00:50:12,254 --> 00:50:15,112
Centurion Trust. How may I help you?

420
00:50:15,192 --> 00:50:17,848
<i>Can I please speak to whoever's in charge?</i>

421
00:50:18,328 --> 00:50:19,965
Hold, please.

422
00:50:22,698 --> 00:50:24,734
They want to talk to you.

423
00:50:31,006 --> 00:50:32,596
<i>Hello?</i>

424
00:50:33,176 --> 00:50:36,234
<i>This is Detective Tom Iger. Hello?</i>

425
00:50:37,544 --> 00:50:40,689
<i>Listen, I'm here to help work this out.</i>

426
00:50:57,967 --> 00:50:59,556
<i>Hello?</i>

427
00:51:01,104 --> 00:51:03,694
<i>Can you tell me if everyone's okay in there.</i>

428
00:51:03,774 --> 00:51:05,851
<i>Let's start there at least.</i>

429
00:51:08,244 --> 00:51:09,812
<i>Hello?</i>

430
00:51:13,749 --> 00:51:15,288
<i>I'm here.</i>

431
00:51:15,368 --> 00:51:18,006
<i>Can you let me know you're hearing me okay?</i>

432
00:51:19,222 --> 00:51:22,412
<i>Listen, I get it.</i>

433
00:51:22,492 --> 00:51:24,715
<i>This was supposed to be simple.</i>

434
00:51:24,795 --> 00:51:27,285
<i>Now, it's a different situation.</i>

435
00:51:28,765 --> 00:51:33,190
<i>If you let them go right now,
we can still make this right.</i>

436
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:35,992
<i>I will work with you every step of the way...</i>

437
00:51:36,072 --> 00:51:39,530
<i>...and I promise you we will make it
right and no one gets hurt.</i>

438
00:51:39,610 --> 00:51:42,819
This is how this is gonna go, Detective.
You're gonna give me 30 minutes...

439
00:51:42,899 --> 00:51:46,837
...and I'll pretend that you never called and
I'll make sure that everyone gets out okay.

440
00:51:46,917 --> 00:51:49,339
The other option, you push us
and these people will die.

441
00:51:49,419 --> 00:51:52,167
- Do you understand me, Detective?
- <i>I promise you, we can work...</i>

442
00:51:52,247 --> 00:51:56,292
The other option, you push us,
and these people will die.

443
00:52:07,737 --> 00:52:10,227
Somebody has a line to the outside.
It's one of your people.

444
00:52:10,307 --> 00:52:12,963
- That's not possible. It doesn't work...
- Why are you lying to me?

445
00:52:13,043 --> 00:52:15,635
It doesn't make sense. It's not protocol.

446
00:52:18,697 --> 00:52:20,522
Who's your head teller?

447
00:52:22,452 --> 00:52:24,545
Who the fuck is your head teller?

448
00:52:26,757 --> 00:52:30,029
Susan Reynolds. Number seven.

449
00:52:30,109 --> 00:52:32,722
- Thank you.
- Please don't hurt her.

450
00:52:46,775 --> 00:52:48,332
Kramer?

451
00:52:48,812 --> 00:52:50,313
Michael?

452
00:52:54,016 --> 00:52:57,019
Shit. Oh, my God.

453
00:53:18,407 --> 00:53:20,517
Okay, no lies.

454
00:53:20,597 --> 00:53:23,986
Short answers. Did you call the police?

455
00:53:24,915 --> 00:53:28,584
- How could I have?
- Then what the fuck is going on?

456
00:53:32,521 --> 00:53:34,957
Answer the fucking question!

457
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:41,371
It was... the bank.

458
00:53:41,451 --> 00:53:42,967
The what?

459
00:53:43,667 --> 00:53:45,719
You're not gonna believe me...

460
00:53:45,799 --> 00:53:48,671
...and I don't want you to hurt anyone.

461
00:53:50,806 --> 00:53:52,674
Try me.

462
00:53:54,843 --> 00:53:57,317
There's something down there...

463
00:53:57,716 --> 00:53:59,565
...in the basement.

464
00:54:00,336 --> 00:54:02,139
The vault.

465
00:54:04,756 --> 00:54:06,602
We're not alone.

466
00:54:08,191 --> 00:54:12,282
- Okay. Okay.
- I'm telling you the truth.

467
00:54:12,362 --> 00:54:14,434
Who's down there?

468
00:54:14,514 --> 00:54:17,396
No one goes down there, not even security...

469
00:54:19,015 --> 00:54:22,159
...because of what happened back in 1982.

470
00:54:22,239 --> 00:54:24,440
A man tried to rob the bank.

471
00:54:33,549 --> 00:54:35,818
<i>Someone got a line out.</i>

472
00:54:39,354 --> 00:54:43,592
<i>The man, he was deranged.
He held them hostage for days.</i>

473
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,444
No food, no water...

474
00:54:48,524 --> 00:54:50,888
...he demanded transportation, a way out...

475
00:54:50,968 --> 00:54:55,404
...but the police, they kept stalling,
and then he... he snapped.

476
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:02,698
<i>He made them shoot each other,
starting with the bank manager.</i>

477
00:55:05,647 --> 00:55:08,171
- He dies.
- I can't.

478
00:55:08,251 --> 00:55:11,541
Or I kill two more and you.

479
00:55:13,621 --> 00:55:15,624
Do it.

480
00:55:15,704 --> 00:55:17,472
Now!

481
00:55:25,834 --> 00:55:29,670
The ones that got away, he hunted them down.

482
00:55:30,741 --> 00:55:33,407
One was executed in the depository...

483
00:55:34,177 --> 00:55:38,435
...another one, a desk clerk,
a young woman...

484
00:55:38,515 --> 00:55:41,232
...was found by the basement boiler.

485
00:55:44,203 --> 00:55:46,626
<i>They kept finding bodies.</i>

486
00:55:47,457 --> 00:55:51,684
<i>Some had been burned alive in the vault.</i>

487
00:56:39,509 --> 00:56:42,798
<i>They all died. Every one of them.</i>

488
00:56:42,878 --> 00:56:46,802
<i>And they never caught the man,
no body, nothing.</i>

489
00:56:46,882 --> 00:56:51,355
Gone. No one saw his face,
no one knew who he was.

490
00:56:53,688 --> 00:56:57,012
You think something like that
just goes away with a paint job?

491
00:56:57,092 --> 00:57:01,650
It's still here. Ask anyone who's been
here, and they'll tell you the same.

492
00:57:01,730 --> 00:57:05,109
Something is still down there...

493
00:57:05,189 --> 00:57:08,830
...in the basement in the old bank.

494
00:57:15,676 --> 00:57:19,135
That was good. That was really good.

495
00:57:19,915 --> 00:57:22,137
I felt like I was there.

496
00:57:22,217 --> 00:57:24,274
The man in the mask.

497
00:57:25,054 --> 00:57:28,977
He just snapped? I don't like ghost stories.

498
00:57:29,157 --> 00:57:31,380
You can make this different.

499
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:34,116
You can walk out that door right now...

500
00:57:34,196 --> 00:57:36,631
...and you can make this right.

501
00:57:55,850 --> 00:57:57,972
This is 120 volts.

502
00:58:01,522 --> 00:58:05,113
And I'd be lying if I said
this wasn't gonna hurt...

503
00:58:05,193 --> 00:58:07,462
...and I wasn't gonna enjoy it.

504
00:58:12,867 --> 00:58:14,951
What are you doing to her?

505
00:58:15,971 --> 00:58:17,827
Why is she on the floor?

506
00:58:18,307 --> 00:58:19,760
You've...

507
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:26,368
Okay.

508
00:58:26,448 --> 00:58:29,238
Michael? Michael?

509
00:58:29,518 --> 00:58:31,273
Michael.

510
00:58:31,353 --> 00:58:33,809
We had one rule.

511
00:58:33,889 --> 00:58:36,611
One. Fuck!

512
00:58:36,691 --> 00:58:40,383
The cops are outside.
We need to get out of here.

513
00:58:41,163 --> 00:58:44,565
Don't fucking touch me.
We had one fucking rule.

514
00:58:44,930 --> 00:58:46,375
Okay.

515
00:59:15,612 --> 00:59:17,481
What happened?

516
00:59:19,851 --> 00:59:21,653
Kramer's dead.

517
00:59:23,322 --> 00:59:24,846
What?

518
00:59:26,526 --> 00:59:28,941
He took this drill bit
and put it to his head.

519
00:59:31,930 --> 00:59:33,765
He's dead.

520
00:59:39,221 --> 00:59:41,090
Something's going on here.

521
00:59:44,193 --> 00:59:46,395
Something's not right about this place.

522
00:59:50,866 --> 00:59:53,555
I'm... I'm sorry about this.

523
00:59:58,507 --> 01:00:00,742
You've always been there for me.

524
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:07,516
We're gonna get out of here.

525
01:00:09,718 --> 01:00:12,587
I swear to God,
we're going to get out of here.

526
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:27,837
There's five times more where that came from.

527
01:00:34,132 --> 01:00:37,340
- What are you guys doing up here?
- Michael says Kramer's dead.

528
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:39,602
- What?
- Kramer's dead.

529
01:00:39,682 --> 01:00:42,038
- He's not.
- The cops are outside.

530
01:00:42,118 --> 01:00:44,275
They just called. They know we're here.

531
01:00:45,555 --> 01:00:48,056
- Cops are here?
- Yeah.

532
01:00:49,491 --> 01:00:51,060
So.

533
01:00:54,596 --> 01:00:56,464
Fuck that.

534
01:01:01,770 --> 01:01:05,047
Okay, all right, we just go back
to the original plan then. We're good.

535
01:01:05,127 --> 01:01:06,964
We'll be home free.

536
01:01:07,614 --> 01:01:11,439
This doesn't make any sense.
Something's not right. These bills...

537
01:01:12,815 --> 01:01:16,000
...these bills are all from the same year.
These are all from 1982.

538
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:19,388
It's all from 1982.

539
01:01:19,688 --> 01:01:22,049
- Every bill is from 1982.
- No, it's not.

540
01:01:22,129 --> 01:01:23,953
Every single bill.

541
01:01:25,094 --> 01:01:27,450
Who cares? It's money.
Isn't that what you want?

542
01:01:27,530 --> 01:01:30,587
- Isn't that what this is about?
- Vee! Listen to me for a minute.

543
01:01:30,667 --> 01:01:34,590
- This doesn't make any fucking sense.
- You're losing it, and you're losing it.

544
01:01:34,670 --> 01:01:37,268
- This has triggered some stuff in your brain.
- Vee!

545
01:01:37,348 --> 01:01:41,129
Are you coming at me again? 'Cause I'm not
gonna deal with it. I'm not dealing with it.

546
01:01:41,209 --> 01:01:45,234
You fucking ruined my life.
Is that... are you good yet?

547
01:01:45,314 --> 01:01:47,749
Is money going to make you happy?

548
01:01:49,452 --> 01:01:53,042
You owe me. You don't give a fuck
about anybody but yourself.

549
01:01:53,122 --> 01:01:56,378
You're going to walk away as soon
as we're fucking done, right?

550
01:01:56,458 --> 01:02:01,734
Am I right? I'm usually right about you,
and how much you have hurt me...

551
01:02:01,814 --> 01:02:04,082
...and this fucking family.

552
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:09,225
If you would just say
you're fucking sorry. Can you?

553
01:02:09,305 --> 01:02:11,594
Can you say you're sorry?

554
01:02:11,674 --> 01:02:15,094
- You owe me. You fucking owe me.
- Get down.

555
01:02:21,716 --> 01:02:23,517
Crazy bitch.

556
01:02:25,086 --> 01:02:27,710
- What the hell is happening?
- I don't know.

557
01:02:27,790 --> 01:02:30,080
But your window just blew out.

558
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:33,183
What are you going to do?

559
01:02:34,103 --> 01:02:37,120
You're the only one thinking straight,
so what are you going to do?

560
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:40,056
What? I don't fucking know.

561
01:02:40,136 --> 01:02:43,125
We're gonna get the fucking money
and get out of here. The plan.

562
01:02:43,205 --> 01:02:46,162
- I'm telling you, she's losing it.
- I know.

563
01:02:46,242 --> 01:02:49,841
She's going to crack.
Okay? I don't trust her.

564
01:02:49,921 --> 01:02:51,903
Neither should you. I've seen this before.

565
01:02:51,983 --> 01:02:54,804
I know how it ends. People are
gonna die unless you do something.

566
01:02:54,884 --> 01:02:56,706
No, they're not.

567
01:02:57,486 --> 01:02:59,576
No, they're not.

568
01:03:01,556 --> 01:03:03,424
No one's gonna die.

569
01:03:05,526 --> 01:03:07,395
Not even you.

570
01:03:43,064 --> 01:03:44,907
- What's their next move?
- I don't know.

571
01:03:44,987 --> 01:03:47,823
- Why the fuck are they shooting at us?
- I don't know.

572
01:03:47,903 --> 01:03:51,762
- Tell me right fucking now.
- I don't know. It doesn't make any sense.

573
01:03:51,842 --> 01:03:53,702
My guess is...

574
01:03:54,626 --> 01:03:56,181
...it's a mistake.

575
01:03:56,261 --> 01:03:58,868
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- No. No.

576
01:03:58,948 --> 01:04:01,149
It's a mistake.

577
01:04:02,450 --> 01:04:05,648
Emotions are as high out there
as they are in here. There's...

578
01:04:05,728 --> 01:04:08,177
...confusion, miscommunication.

579
01:04:08,257 --> 01:04:12,318
You assumed they're organized out there.
I guarantee you they are not organized.

580
01:04:13,996 --> 01:04:19,388
There are probably 3 different departments
all vying for command, Police, FBI, ATF.

581
01:04:19,468 --> 01:04:22,959
Who the hell knows. You don't know
who's in charge and neither do they.

582
01:04:24,239 --> 01:04:26,128
Why would they do that?

583
01:04:26,608 --> 01:04:28,676
It's not a strategic move.

584
01:04:30,711 --> 01:04:34,237
- Unless...
- Unless what?

585
01:04:34,617 --> 01:04:36,707
Unless they're trying to isolate you.

586
01:04:38,087 --> 01:04:40,309
They need to see movement, good faith.

587
01:04:40,389 --> 01:04:41,777
How?

588
01:04:41,857 --> 01:04:45,548
- Release a hostage. It'll buy you time.
- No fucking way.

589
01:04:45,628 --> 01:04:49,698
The only way to save yourself
is to end this peacefully.

590
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:54,335
Do you think I want to be here?

591
01:04:56,004 --> 01:04:58,206
I'm a hostage just like you.

592
01:05:16,223 --> 01:05:17,725
Please.

593
01:05:35,876 --> 01:05:37,712
Help me.

594
01:05:54,862 --> 01:05:58,029
- What the fuck is that?
- An outgoing call.

595
01:06:00,835 --> 01:06:03,525
<i>Hello. This is Centurion Trust.</i>

596
01:06:03,605 --> 01:06:07,262
<i>We have a robbery in progress at 23 Forsythe.</i>

597
01:06:07,342 --> 01:06:09,531
<i>Please send the police.</i>

598
01:06:09,611 --> 01:06:11,667
<i>In progress right now.
They're in the building.</i>

599
01:06:11,747 --> 01:06:13,502
Can you describe the assailant?

600
01:06:13,582 --> 01:06:16,417
<i>They're taking hostages, so as soon...</i>

601
01:06:53,771 --> 01:06:55,273
Hey.

602
01:07:01,712 --> 01:07:05,149
Please, don't hurt me. Please.

603
01:07:11,589 --> 01:07:14,425
No, no, no, no, nobody...
nobody's gonna hurt you.

604
01:07:17,796 --> 01:07:19,631
What's your name?

605
01:07:22,766 --> 01:07:24,268
Samantha.

606
01:07:25,870 --> 01:07:29,517
- Samantha Campbell.
- What happened to you, Samantha?

607
01:07:29,809 --> 01:07:32,210
My ankle, I think it's broken.

608
01:07:36,281 --> 01:07:38,037
Yeah?

609
01:07:38,117 --> 01:07:40,151
You're not one of them, are you?

610
01:07:42,586 --> 01:07:45,078
What do you mean? I'm not one of who?

611
01:07:46,558 --> 01:07:48,369
Michael!

612
01:08:07,245 --> 01:08:09,335
- What are you doing, Detective?
- <i>Listen to me.</i>

613
01:08:09,415 --> 01:08:13,639
<i>We spotted what we thought was a civilian
in distress, and an order was given.</i>

614
01:08:13,719 --> 01:08:16,325
<i>But you have my word. We're standing down.</i>

615
01:08:16,405 --> 01:08:19,763
<i>We don't want anyone to get hurt.
Including you. You have my word on that.</i>

616
01:08:19,843 --> 01:08:21,852
Do you have any idea who you're dealing with?

617
01:08:23,212 --> 01:08:25,868
I can only control these guys for so long.

618
01:08:25,948 --> 01:08:28,337
<i>Same as me. So you gotta
give us something to work with.</i>

619
01:08:28,417 --> 01:08:29,971
Okay.

620
01:08:30,451 --> 01:08:33,388
Okay. I'm gonna give you
something to work with.

621
01:08:42,965 --> 01:08:44,487
Michael?

622
01:08:45,167 --> 01:08:46,991
Where are you?

623
01:08:48,871 --> 01:08:50,460
Michael?

624
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:53,743
Michael!

625
01:09:01,049 --> 01:09:02,493
Michael!

626
01:09:04,853 --> 01:09:06,921
Where are you?

627
01:09:19,367 --> 01:09:23,259
Right now, there are hostages at gunpoint.
If anything happens to me, two of them die.

628
01:09:23,339 --> 01:09:27,396
- Do you understand?
- I hear you loud and clear.

629
01:09:27,476 --> 01:09:31,512
We're not going to let that happen, okay?
We're going to work through this.

630
01:09:36,317 --> 01:09:37,818
Who called?

631
01:09:39,287 --> 01:09:41,560
We never received any phone calls.

632
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:44,551
I fucking heard the call. Who called?

633
01:09:44,793 --> 01:09:48,080
We got something on the radio.
It was garbled. It sounded like trouble.

634
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:51,020
That was it. No phone call.

635
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,929
Get out of here.

636
01:09:54,209 --> 01:09:55,736
Go.

637
01:09:57,938 --> 01:09:59,190
Wait.

638
01:10:11,018 --> 01:10:13,642
<i>Hello. This is Centurion Trust.</i>

639
01:10:13,722 --> 01:10:17,246
<i>We have a robbery in progress at 23 Forsythe.</i>

640
01:10:17,326 --> 01:10:19,414
<i>Please send the police.</i>

641
01:10:19,494 --> 01:10:21,464
<i>In progress right now.
They're in the building.</i>

642
01:10:21,544 --> 01:10:25,090
<i>They're taking hostages,
so as soon as you can.</i>

643
01:10:34,943 --> 01:10:36,812
Did you hear it?

644
01:11:01,870 --> 01:11:04,326
Michael? Hey, come on.

645
01:11:04,406 --> 01:11:07,329
- Michael, I'm serious.
- Look at me. Look at me. Hey, listen.

646
01:11:07,409 --> 01:11:10,065
This hallway, to the right,
there's a first door to the water main.

647
01:11:10,145 --> 01:11:13,668
There's a big hole. Everything's ready. Just
hop in there, and you get out of here, okay?

648
01:11:13,748 --> 01:11:16,772
When we get out of here, we're going to do
everything we wanted to do, all right?

649
01:11:16,852 --> 01:11:19,542
- Where the fuck are you going?
- Look at me.

650
01:11:20,622 --> 01:11:22,178
Michael?

651
01:11:22,458 --> 01:11:24,713
- What? Look, I'm serious.
- I'll see you soon, all right?

652
01:11:24,793 --> 01:11:26,722
Come with me. Please.

653
01:11:27,162 --> 01:11:29,511
- I'll see you soon.
- Michael, I'm serious. Come on.

654
01:11:30,636 --> 01:11:31,936
Alright.

655
01:11:32,016 --> 01:11:34,235
Shit. Jesus.

656
01:11:48,015 --> 01:11:49,606
Holy shit.

657
01:11:51,786 --> 01:11:53,307
Fuck.

658
01:12:21,709 --> 01:12:26,241
Now they have to come in.
The police, they have no choice.

659
01:12:27,621 --> 01:12:29,704
Please, you have to let them go.

660
01:12:41,101 --> 01:12:43,959
- Go.
- Maybe I was wrong about you.

661
01:12:44,539 --> 01:12:46,040
Go.

662
01:13:15,536 --> 01:13:17,727
Hey. Hey.

663
01:13:17,807 --> 01:13:20,054
Hey, come on. Get up.

664
01:13:27,115 --> 01:13:28,604
Hey!

665
01:13:28,684 --> 01:13:30,352
Don't go down there.

666
01:14:15,796 --> 01:14:20,468
Come on. You're gonna be okay.
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

667
01:15:20,127 --> 01:15:21,859
Leah!

668
01:16:57,524 --> 01:17:00,769
Keep moving. I'll be right behind you.

669
01:17:04,848 --> 01:17:06,376
Michael!

670
01:17:18,228 --> 01:17:19,796
Michael!

671
01:17:43,286 --> 01:17:44,855
Michael!

672
01:18:50,571 --> 01:18:52,216
No.

673
01:18:53,491 --> 01:18:57,539
- You take care of your sister.
- I'm not leaving without you.

674
01:18:57,619 --> 01:18:59,185
Go!

675
01:19:00,865 --> 01:19:02,749
It's gonna be okay.

676
01:19:19,817 --> 01:19:23,108
<i>Police are investigating last night's
armed robbery and arson...</i>

677
01:19:23,188 --> 01:19:24,910
<i>...of the Centurion Trust Bank.</i>

678
01:19:24,990 --> 01:19:28,047
<i>According to a statement released
by the department this morning...</i>

679
01:19:28,127 --> 01:19:32,213
<i>...at about 5:15 p.m., police responded
to a call from inside the bank...</i>

680
01:19:32,293 --> 01:19:36,388
<i>...where six employees and one patron
were being held hostage at gunpoint.</i>

681
01:19:36,468 --> 01:19:39,433
<i>Bank employees described five bank robbers...</i>

682
01:19:39,513 --> 01:19:43,662
<i>...three white males, two white females.
The robbers were armed.</i>

683
01:19:43,742 --> 01:19:46,317
<i>The bank employees were transported
to Grant Hospital...</i>

684
01:19:46,397 --> 01:19:49,193
<i>...where they were treated
for injuries and were later released.</i>

685
01:19:49,273 --> 01:19:52,838
<i>The robbers are all believed to have died
in the fire, authorities have said.</i>

686
01:19:52,918 --> 01:19:56,122
<i>The forecast, plenty of sunshine
through today...</i>

687
01:20:34,043 --> 01:20:37,461
- I heard on the radio...
- They're saying that we're dead.

688
01:20:43,634 --> 01:20:45,635
What was that?

689
01:20:50,174 --> 01:20:52,376
What did you see down there?

690
01:20:57,781 --> 01:21:00,505
Because I know what I saw. We were attacked.

691
01:21:00,585 --> 01:21:02,401
By the police.

692
01:21:03,438 --> 01:21:05,661
No, it's not the police.

693
01:21:06,341 --> 01:21:08,809
Come on, tell me, you saw.

694
01:21:12,262 --> 01:21:15,393
I don't know what I fucking saw,
all right? I saw you hesitate...

695
01:21:15,473 --> 01:21:18,513
...when we were supposed to be leaving
and the cops were trying to fucking kill us.

696
01:21:18,593 --> 01:21:21,720
And I saw the vault,
and I saw that it was empty...

697
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:25,225
...'cause someone went down there and
cleared it out. So where's the money?

698
01:21:28,929 --> 01:21:31,331
Where is the fucking money, Leah?

699
01:21:54,688 --> 01:21:56,556
Where's Michael?

700
01:22:06,365 --> 01:22:10,125
Wait, you were with him. You didn't...
you didn't take care of him?

701
01:22:10,205 --> 01:22:13,670
- He wouldn't come with me. I tried.
- Where is he?

702
01:22:17,444 --> 01:22:20,080
He's dead, Vee.

703
01:22:32,559 --> 01:22:34,428
Don't touch me.

704
01:23:33,653 --> 01:23:37,445
This guy that you're talking about. He's not
showing up on any of the camera footage.

705
01:23:37,525 --> 01:23:40,749
None of the cameras, he's not there.
He's not anywhere to be found.

706
01:23:40,829 --> 01:23:45,053
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying it just doesn't add up.

707
01:23:45,133 --> 01:23:48,798
You know this bank inside and out,
vault's customers throughout the years...

708
01:23:48,878 --> 01:23:52,727
...and yet, you don't
recognize this individual.

709
01:23:53,507 --> 01:23:56,121
I've got six positive IDs...

710
01:23:56,583 --> 01:23:59,834
...six hostages, but you're
telling me that there's seven.

711
01:23:59,914 --> 01:24:03,304
I thought this was just a de-briefing?
Am I a suspect now too?

712
01:24:03,384 --> 01:24:06,040
They took your radio, your firearm.

713
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:08,677
Any shred of dignity you had left...

714
01:24:09,157 --> 01:24:11,783
...well, I guess you didn't,
because they took that too, right?

715
01:24:12,293 --> 01:24:15,604
- Why did you get special treatment?
- What treatment?

716
01:24:15,864 --> 01:24:18,600
I was a hostage. I barely made it out.

717
01:24:18,900 --> 01:24:22,323
You got your own room. You were
the only hostage that was let go.

718
01:24:31,745 --> 01:24:35,670
- How old was he?
- I don't remember. Forties, maybe.

719
01:24:35,750 --> 01:24:40,008
- Did he say a name? Any names called?
- I don't remember any names.

720
01:24:40,088 --> 01:24:42,110
What were they talking about?

721
01:24:42,890 --> 01:24:46,114
- The vault. And the alarm.
- Could you make out a voice?

722
01:24:46,194 --> 01:24:52,421
He was telling them all the steps they
needed to make to disarm the alarm.

723
01:24:52,501 --> 01:24:54,523
So he did or did not work at the bank?

724
01:24:54,603 --> 01:24:56,805
He must have. He wouldn't know those things.

725
01:24:56,885 --> 01:24:59,027
How the fuck should I know?
Yeah, maybe he worked there.

726
01:24:59,107 --> 01:25:01,988
No, he was not a bank employee.

727
01:25:14,687 --> 01:25:18,009
- Did he say his name?
- He never said his name...

728
01:25:18,089 --> 01:25:21,970
...but I know everybody that's worked
at that bank for the past 10 years...

729
01:25:22,430 --> 01:25:26,254
- ...and I have never seen him there before.
- Are you saying you saw this man...

730
01:25:26,334 --> 01:25:30,024
...but he's not showing up
on any of the bank cameras.

731
01:25:30,104 --> 01:25:32,394
You realize that, don't you?

732
01:25:33,214 --> 01:25:37,031
All the cameras we have,
all the backup systems, he's...

733
01:25:37,111 --> 01:25:39,379
...I mean, he's nowhere to be found.

734
01:25:55,896 --> 01:26:00,514
You've seen employees come and go,
regional managers, auditors...

735
01:26:01,964 --> 01:26:04,572
...yet, you don't know who this guy is?

736
01:26:29,663 --> 01:26:32,220
<i>Hello, this is Centurion Trust.</i>

737
01:26:32,300 --> 01:26:35,807
<i>We have a robbery in progress at 23 Forsythe.</i>

738
01:26:35,887 --> 01:26:38,593
<i>Please, send the police.
In progress right now.</i>

739
01:26:38,673 --> 01:26:43,162
They're in the building, they're taking
hostages, as soon as you can.

740
01:26:46,813 --> 01:26:48,615
That's him.

741
01:26:53,453 --> 01:26:55,655
Where? This guy?

742
01:26:56,823 --> 01:26:58,825
That's not possible.

743
01:27:02,429 --> 01:27:05,499
That's one of the original
hostages from 1982.

744
01:27:36,663 --> 01:27:38,619
What's wrong?

745
01:27:38,699 --> 01:27:40,500
It won't start.

746
01:27:42,836 --> 01:27:44,859
All right, pop the hood.

747
01:27:45,039 --> 01:27:48,108
And when I say crank it, try it.

748
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:03,350
Okay, try it.

749
01:28:26,179 --> 01:28:27,681
Fuck.

750
01:28:31,350 --> 01:28:32,852
Vee!

751
01:28:33,305 --> 01:29:33,479
