00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,096
Good day,

3
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:25,852
all you hopeless jailbirds waiting to
end your lives locked up in these cells!

4
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:30,482
If y'all are just waiting for
your death, how 'bout it?

5
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:34,940
Why don't y'all fight to
the death in those cells?!

6
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:42,498
Whoever lives... I'll make you part of
my crew and take y'all with me outside!

7
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:11,189
Take the others, but not him.

8
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,860
So, he was alive...

9
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:20,410
The man known as the "demon heir"...

10
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:33,048
"2 years later"

11
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:35,633
. I I 0 ; .. I o. I.: I I a.
0 - ..

12
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:36,046
Wealth, fame, power...

13
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:41,428
Gold Roger, the king of the pirates, once
attained everything this world had to offer...

14
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:47,684
The last words before his death drove
people around the world to the seas.

15
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:50,732
"My treasure? If you want
it, you can have it.

16
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:54,732
Find it. I left everything
the world has to offer there."

17
00:01:56,116 --> 00:02:00,485
These words sparked the great pirate era.

18
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:08,122
That moment... I died once...
And so did you.

19
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:14,757
But... count me in.

20
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:20,713
I, buena festa, have the
greatest information of my life!

21
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:24,299
The treasure he hid away
is within my hands!

22
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:30,731
With that... everything that
you desire will be yours!

23
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,432
Let's do it...

24
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:38,114
The world's largest festival of the pirates,
by the pirates, for the pirates...!

25
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:42,034
The pirates fest!

26
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:47,740
Ahem, "to all of my dearest pirates!

27
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:51,952
A mix of enemies and allies
exchanging toasts can be fun.

28
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,037
Anyone is free to come
and go as they please.

29
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:58,796
We invite you to this world's
largest banquet, the pirates fest.

30
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:03,221
Sincerely, buena festa,
festival pirates captain."

31
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,349
I see it!

32
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:09,769
Festival!

33
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:14,191
I have heard of the pirates fest.

34
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:18,863
It is an enormous pirate festival
suddenly held once every few years.

35
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:24,990
I hear rare ships, food, weapons, information,
and such from around the world will be there.

36
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,992
Like a pirates' black market, eh?

37
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,994
Sounds like there'll be good booze, too.

38
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,043
"Furthermore, this time around,
as entertainment, a"...

39
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:35,587
"Gold Roger, the
king of the pirates"...

40
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:40,008
"-Related treasure hunt is planned."

41
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,380
Sounds like fun!

42
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:44,508
"Hunt for the pirate king's treasure"!

43
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:47,182
A pirate festival?
Treasure hunt! Treasure hunt!

44
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:51,144
They even sent us an eternal pose to the
festival's island... treasure hunt! Treasure hunt!

45
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:52,934
And what's more, the pirate king's...
Treasure hunt! Treasure hunt!

46
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,419
And what's more, the pirate king's...
Treasure hunt!

47
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:55,979
Hey! Have some suspicions!

48
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:56,808
She's scary!

49
00:03:57,028 --> 00:04:01,863
Buena festa was known as the
world's no. 1 festival master,

50
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:05,738
as well as a pirate who had strong ties
to informants and weapon merchants,

51
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:08,787
and was the subject of endless dark rumors.

52
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:10,785
But I thought he was dead.

53
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:13,959
A dead man and the pirate
king's treasure...

54
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:16,332
Well, whatever the truth is,

55
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:20,757
we can't ignore the words
"king of the pirates." Right, captain?

56
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:26,464
It's a treasure hunt among pirates!
Of course it's gonna be fun!

57
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:30,221
Let's go! To the pirates fest!

58
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,111
Marvelous...

59
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:14,701
The main players are arriving...

60
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:18,625
Excuse me, Mr. festa.

61
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:37,140
You sure do look feisty... monkey d. Luffy.

62
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:41,140
This is the grand festival
to celebrate our launch.

63
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:43,816
Make sure you fire it up!

64
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:48,233
My dear pirates!

65
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:52,819
You havin' fun at the pirates fest?!

66
00:06:56,708 --> 00:07:00,371
I'm sure you all know, but fights,
kidnapping, stealing, etc...

67
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:02,999
Anything is allowed in this pirates fest!

68
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:05,921
But... there's just one solid rule!

69
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:09,422
Never tell the Navy about this festival!

70
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:16,760
Anyone who does... will be chased to the ends
of hell and eliminated by all the pirates here.

71
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:19,094
Ooh, how scary!

72
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:20,850
Oops, I haven't introduced myself!

73
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:25,025
I am the mc and your host, Donald moderate!

74
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:29,980
And here is our special guest!
Everyone's favorite songstress, Ann!

75
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,316
Nice to meet you, everyone!

76
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:35,618
As you all know,
Ann is a devil fruit power-user!

77
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,617
Viso-viso vision!

78
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,448
Whoa! Hot!

79
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:41,875
The viso-viso fruit!

80
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:46,706
Its power can turn any touched
image into a visual illusion!

81
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:48,125
Though it vanishes right away.

82
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:49,795
Thank you!

83
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:53,469
Now, we're resurrecting this
pirates fest after 20 long years.

84
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:57,641
And there's a reason why
it takes place on this island!

85
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:01,015
It is said that a little before
the dawn of the great pirate era,

86
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:04,143
gold Roger, the king of the pirates,
discovered this island

87
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:08,022
and hid an amazing treasure
somewhere on this island!

88
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:10,729
And this is what he said:

89
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:16,945
"In a deep, lofty darkness,
we leave our answer."

90
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:21,372
Now, my friends! This is a challenge
from the king of the pirates!

91
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:27,295
Let us solve this mystery and
get our hands on that treasure!

92
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:36,178
Hey, hurry! They're saying somethin'!

93
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:37,756
We're super late!

94
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:42,970
That's you guys' fault! I said we were
just getting ready for the treasure hunt!

95
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,029
Why'd you have to stuff
yourselves like that?!

96
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,189
Look who's talking.

97
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:50,018
At any rate, this pumped-up crowd...

98
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:52,194
This is the real deal!

99
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:54,989
Yeah! Can't wait!

100
00:08:56,453 --> 00:09:01,163
Don't you all worry! The almighty usopp
will get the treasure for sure!

101
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,454
Let's go, chopper!

102
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:03,667
Yeah!

103
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,833
Guess we just have to go along with them.

104
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:08,708
But as far as I can tell from
the pirates gathered here...

105
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:12,256
Yeah... I see tons of crazy guys.

106
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:12,878
What?!

107
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:16,678
Hey all! The sunny's ready to go anytime!

108
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,346
Countin' on ya, franky!

109
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:18,929
Ugh. Countin' on ya, franky!

110
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,508
My "mustn't treasure hunt"
disease is getting to me...

111
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:24,014
You okay, usopp?!

112
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:31,481
What the hell... are you doing,
ya flashy idiots?!

113
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,687
Not me! It's this guy's fault!

114
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,647
Why is it my fault?!

115
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:37,573
Shut up flashily! Hurry up and find him!

116
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:39,993
You're the one responsible for security!

117
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:43,868
Correct! I am responsible
for security here!

118
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,416
I'm one of the terrifying
seven warlords of the seal

119
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:51,873
the living legend...
Captain buggy, the genius Jester!

120
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:57,553
We sent in 200 security pirates,
and yet, still can't catch one rat...!

121
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:03,054
Our pay from that festival geezer's
gonna go down! Find him flashily!

122
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:07,603
Looks like the situation's gonna
be far worse than I thought.

123
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:08,430
Straw hat-ya!

124
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:09,650
Aha!

125
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:12,939
Found you! Trafalgar law!

126
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,896
Room... shambles!

127
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,366
He vanished?!

128
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:28,033
The pirates fest... to think that this
many pirates actually gathered...

129
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:30,790
"Arrest them all this second"...

130
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,191
Is what I wanna say, but...

131
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:35,378
Our main target is the big boss,
festa the "festival master."

132
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:40,508
A big-time pirate from the days of Roger
who we thought died in a sea king accident.

133
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,463
And this guy, too.

134
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:46,222
The man the Navy headquarters
won't even admit is alive.

135
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:51,272
Douglas bullet... the worst escapee
from level 6 at impel down...

136
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:57,445
If these two are teamed up,
this is clearly no ordinary festival.

137
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:58,863
What was that?

138
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:01,994
What's goin' on?

139
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:06,412
S-5-s-s-s-stop! It's a sign to stop!

140
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,285
No... this must be...

141
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,241
The current's flow is...

142
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:17,966
My god! S-something crazy
has started to happen!

143
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:24,172
Ah! My friends!
Remember those words I said earlier!

144
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,553
"In a deep, lofty darkness"...

145
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,976
"We leave our answer."

146
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:32,181
But what does it mean by "lofty"?!

147
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:42,194
C-could this be...?!

148
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,490
Wait... I get it.

149
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:47,616
From the darkness of the deep sea,
it climbs to the heavens above!

150
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,163
Awesome!

151
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:54,335
It's the shooting sea current...
The knock-up stream!

152
00:11:57,342 --> 00:12:01,255
Whoa! And a bunch of bubbles have appeared!

153
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:07,174
Furthermore...! A very, very large...

154
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,851
Whoaaaa! What is that?!

155
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:16,934
An... island?! It's a bubble
with a whole island inside it!

156
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,268
How pretty!

157
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:23,573
There's no mistake! That's gotta
be Roger's hidden answer!

158
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:28,324
Now, my friends! How will you
proceed to that treasure island?!

159
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:30,996
All right! Go, franky!

160
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:36,044
Leave it to me, cap'n! This is why
we have a... secret weapon!

161
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:38,713
A secret weapon?!

162
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:41,041
Out of my way, shrimps...

163
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,923
Ooh! The first ones to kick things off are

164
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:48,176
the infamous kid pirates
from the worst generation!

165
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:52,887
Their captain, eustass "captain" kid,
and his partner, "massacre soldier" killer,

166
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:54,562
are in the game!

167
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,390
Now the pirates fest is heating up!

168
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,214
The hunt for the treasure of gold Roger,
the king of the pirates...!

169
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:03,696
No! This is pretty much
like a treasure race!

170
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,990
Now start!

171
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:14,909
Kid, you're gonna play
along with this game?

172
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:17,244
A game, eh...?

173
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:18,703
A-pa-pa!

174
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:22,666
Now! Pirates aiming for the
treasure are following kid!

175
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:25,672
The on-air pirates are
sailing rhythmically!

176
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:28,095
This is their captain, scratchmen apoo!

177
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:31,095
What's all the rush, yo?!

178
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:34,644
Ohh! And the Drake pirates got ahead!

179
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:37,598
X. Drake is closing in on kid!

180
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,892
Red flag and sea roar, eh...?

181
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:44,900
And! With the only female captain in
the worst generation... the Bonney pirates!

182
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:46,822
This is Bonney, the "glutton"!

183
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:49,651
More pizzas!

184
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:51,361
The hell are you doin'?!

185
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:54,744
Please make way, young lady.

186
00:13:54,959 --> 00:14:00,704
The fallen monk pirates have cut in!
This is their captain... urouge!

187
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:05,041
Ohh! What a merciless blast
from the firetank pirates!

188
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,751
It's Capone "gang" bege!

189
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,962
Can't beat me in numbers...

190
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:11,138
Next, the Hawkins pirates follow!

191
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:14,434
Hey... is this the time
to be reading fortunes?!

192
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:18,308
We'll support luffy-senpai with all we got!

193
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,856
I'm going to stand out the most!

194
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:23,276
Hey! Let me do the introductions, too!

195
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:25,299
The ones who are closing in
on the worst generation

196
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:28,690
are bartolomeo the cannibal
and white horse cavendish!

197
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:31,447
And! And...!

198
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,072
A bunch of other pirates, too.

199
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,529
Introduce us properly!

200
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:37,035
What's gonna happen in this treasure race?!

201
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:41,460
They're climbing neck-and-neck
up the knock-up stream!

202
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:43,208
So that's where the treasure is?

203
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,460
I'll leave the ruckus at the center to you.

204
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:46,335
What?!

205
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,543
Report the situation via transponder snail.

206
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:50,469
Where are you going, smoker-San?!

207
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:53,718
I'm taking this chance to sneak
into festa's hideout.

208
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:57,519
I'm going straight for
the one behind all this.

209
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,096
Sorry for the wait, guys!

210
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:03,979
This is the thousand sunny flying version!

211
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:07,904
Emperor penguin form!

212
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:09,447
So cool!

213
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:11,650
Now, let's go and catch up!

214
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:14,451
Stop right there, you damn rubber man!

215
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:20,082
Long time no see, straw hat!
Now, hand him over!

216
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:21,033
Oh, buggy.

217
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:21,788
Ugh.

218
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,540
You guys ready?!

219
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:27,749
Coup de... burst!

220
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:29,459
Buggyyyn!

221
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:35,174
Here we go!

222
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:37,850
Wh-whoaaa!

223
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,303
Th-th-this is incredible!

224
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:43,310
From rock bottom,
they've shot up towards the top!

225
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:45,812
There's not a soul at sea
who doesn't know this guy!

226
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:49,191
The man with a 1.5 billion
bounty on his head!

227
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:52,365
It's monkey d. Luffy!

228
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:57,412
With the straw hats joining the game,
this treasure race is heating up even more!

229
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:00,160
Straw hat! I'm cheering for you!

230
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,741
Luffy-senpai

231
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,497
don't stand out more than me!

232
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:05,669
That's not fair, straw hat!

233
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:06,997
Eeeeek!

234
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,878
We're gonna blast right through!

235
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:34,482
Excellent.

236
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:41,656
Now, it's about time to
get on with your plan.

237
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:45,879
The heck is that?!

238
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:50,923
The straw hat pirates jumped
straight into the lead!

239
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:54,127
Way to make things interesting, straw hat.

240
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:55,462
Splashdown complete!

241
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,217
Thank goodness...

242
00:16:57,433 --> 00:17:00,800
We got pretty far ahead, but make sure
you prepare for attacks from behind.

243
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,885
Franky, that was awesome!

244
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,105
'Course it was!

245
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:06,351
All right! Let's zip right through this!

246
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,774
Zip through!

247
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:10,442
What's the matter?

248
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,400
Ah!

249
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:15,527
Tra-guy!

250
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,483
Straw... hat-ya...

251
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:18,442
I need the first-aid kit!

252
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:19,806
What on earth happened?
I need the first-aid kit!

253
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,230
You need to be treated immediately!

254
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:24,123
Don't need it. I'll be leaving right away.

255
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:27,953
You guys leave this
island right this second.

256
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,163
Festa... is...

257
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:33,070
Talking about the host of the pirates fest?

258
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:38,839
Not just festa. They're
plotting something bad.

259
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:45,099
I've managed to let my crew escape...
But this place will become a warzone.

260
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,350
Hey, hey, what's the deal all of a sudden?!

261
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,774
Wait, tra-guy!

262
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:52,193
Tra-guy, you need to be resting!

263
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:55,738
Sorry for intruding. This is the matter
I've been investigating.

264
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,111
Where are you going in that condition?!

265
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:01,945
I'm gonna go pay them back.

266
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:05,702
Whoa! Those guys behind us
are already catchin' up!

267
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,705
This is bad! What'll we do?!

268
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:13,832
We're gonna keep going!

269
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:16,007
But we can't leave tra-guy
like that, either!

270
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,835
Chopper, look after him!

271
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:18,760
Got it!

272
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,174
Hey, I'm leaving! - Got it!

273
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:22,131
Then I'll go, too.

274
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,807
"Not just festa"... which means that

275
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:28,889
there are parties engaging in deals
and conflicts behind the scenes.

276
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:34,478
If this festival is a trap, this isn't
only tra-guy-kun's problem.

277
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:35,732
Let me go investigate.

278
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,564
Then I'll be Robin-chan's bodyguard!

279
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,321
If it's covert work, I
shall accompany them.

280
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:42,537
Okay, got it!

281
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,320
Hey! It's gettin' interesting.

282
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,540
You mean bad.

283
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,366
It could be connected to
the treasure, so be thorough.

284
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:50,542
Roger that, nami-San!

285
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:52,871
Let's do it! Tra-guy!

286
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,960
Do what you want.

287
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:59,795
If we're splitting up, you can use that.

288
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:05,182
What're we gonna do?!

289
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:07,142
We're going to die!
What're we gonna do?!

290
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:10,688
Oh, but I'm already dead!

291
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,561
Mil Fleur!

292
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,903
You saved us, Robin-chan.

293
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,360
If anything happens,
call with this transponder snail!

294
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,239
Roger.

295
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:26,741
Let me treat you first.

296
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:27,992
No...

297
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:31,827
Let's hurry. We're going to the
underground of this island...

298
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:33,877
To find festa!

299
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:40,711
Let's go now! We're almost
to the treasure island!

300
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:45,515
Now! The pirate ships' close race
is reaching its climax!

301
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:47,808
I see the top!

302
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,557
Wh-what's gonna happen to us?!

303
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:54,186
Full speed... ahead!

304
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:09,531
The top group has climbed all the
way up... the knock-up stream!

305
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,287
Countless pirate ships are
soaring through the air!

306
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:15,745
I've never seen anything like this!

307
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:19,378
And! The first to reach
the treasure island is...

308
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:25,676
Sure enough, the straw hat pirates!

309
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,847
Whoa!

310
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:32,807
Wow! Wh-what's this?!

311
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:35,560
A giant galleon ship lays
on the treasure island!

312
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,767
And look at what's there!

313
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:40,148
There's a mountain of treasure!

314
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:42,821
The whole situation is getting crazy!

315
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:44,148
Whoa!

316
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:47,280
Mountain of treasure! A treasure ship!

317
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:50,659
Luffy!

318
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,661
The treasure's ours!

319
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:57,745
That treasure chest looks
older and extra fishy.

320
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:01,128
I can smell the air of mystery
all the way from here!

321
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:05,632
Luffy! There's a small, old treasure
chest within the pile of treasure!

322
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:08,464
That's probably the pirate king's treasure!

323
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:09,684
Got it!

324
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:12,389
All right! You guys go grab it!

325
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:14,561
You're going, too! What're you scared of?!

326
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:16,389
Don't be silly!

327
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:19,692
I'm a sniper. Assisting them is my role.

328
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:21,565
You're just being a chicken.

329
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,438
This is getting fun!

330
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:25,443
There's treasure!

331
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:27,069
Get the treasure!

332
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:31,825
Now, the treasure hunt race
has reached its final stage!

333
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:37,754
Go on ahead!

334
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,203
Got it!

335
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:47,003
You're fightin' me...

336
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:49,054
Pirate hunter...!

337
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,633
Boom!

338
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,521
Straw hat!

339
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:58,733
Who're you?!

340
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:02,185
We are sick n' tired of your craziness!

341
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:03,814
I'm gonna get that treasure!

342
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,031
See yal!

343
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:07,323
Just keep fighting each other, ya idiots!

344
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:08,820
You...!

345
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,159
Are you gonna get in my way?

346
00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:18,413
This is a race. You're supposed
to get in people's way.

347
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:20,961
Sounds like you wanna die.

348
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:28,090
Get outta my way!

349
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:32,969
Gum-gum... elephant gun!

350
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:37,978
Stop, straw hat!

351
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:43,105
This is becoming one heck of
a race! Who's gonna...? Huh?!

352
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:47,233
Who on earth is gonna win?!

353
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:50,657
It's an easy win with my troops!

354
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:56,660
Outta my way!

355
00:23:04,675 --> 00:23:05,915
What a sight!

356
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:08,842
Why, you little...

357
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,464
Captain! Let's hurry...

358
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:15,425
Stealing, success rate... 40%...

359
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:18,351
Here we go, guys!

360
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:21,101
Special attack, green star!

361
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,183
Impact wolf!

362
00:23:25,446 --> 00:23:28,438
Thunderbolt tempo!

363
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:35,320
Franky radical beam!

364
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:39,080
Move, move, move!

365
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:48,383
Gum-gum... giant pistol!

366
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:55,173
There it is!

367
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:06,518
Everybody's strong. This is fun!

368
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:12,527
Be quiet, you!

369
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:15,450
Treasure's more important than security.

370
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:17,153
Get him! These dudes are crazy!

371
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:18,764
Knock him out!
These dudes are crazy!

372
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:35,720
Up ahead is his hideout. But watch out.

373
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:38,891
I was ambushed here earlier.

374
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:49,101
Ah. Huh?

375
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,943
It stinks, brook!

376
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,365
Please excuse me.

377
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:56,987
Be quiet!

378
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:59,365
I apologize.

379
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:02,493
It doesn't look like we can
go any further. Robin-chan.

380
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:04,996
Okay. Then I shall, too.

381
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:14,586
Don't worry, it won't cause
you sponsors any trouble.

382
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:20,016
Everything's going smoothly.
Just as planned, we'll have 'em launch...

383
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:23,310
A buster call on this island.

384
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,393
Hm? What's wrong?

385
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:30,525
What's the deal?!

386
00:25:30,738 --> 00:25:32,694
"Buster call"... as in that buster call?!

387
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:36,865
It's a large-scale Navy attack that
obliterates everything and everyone.

388
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:39,693
The whole island will be wiped off the map.

389
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:43,371
We know that! But why do that now?!

390
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:46,792
Not sure... but we need
to let everyone know.

391
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:53,499
Why the hell are you bastards here?!

392
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:57,003
It's quite rude of you to suddenly attack.

393
00:25:57,222 --> 00:26:00,760
Brook, watch out!
A sea prism stone is built into it!

394
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:02,386
That's right.

395
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:05,265
The stone emits the same energy as the sea.

396
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:08,188
Any devil fruit power-user that
touches this becomes helpless.

397
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,267
I'll stop him here. You guys get to luffy!

398
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:14,103
You think I'd let you?!

399
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:20,764
Take Robin-chan with you and run!

400
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:22,153
I don't think so!

401
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:25,914
Leave her the hell alone!

402
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:27,457
Haki, huh?

403
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:32,584
What are you all up to?

404
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,257
That's our line!

405
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:39,803
Behold! This is a close race!

406
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:42,347
And many pirates are dropping out!

407
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,768
Who is gonna get their
hands on the treasure?!

408
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:50,733
Out of my way!

409
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:52,937
Same to you!

410
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:55,269
I got it!

411
00:26:57,116 --> 00:27:01,701
The pirate king's treasure... is all mine!

412
00:27:01,912 --> 00:27:03,948
That damn clown!

413
00:27:05,082 --> 00:27:08,791
Buggy! The treasure's mine!

414
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:11,754
You damn rubber man!

415
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:14,171
Let's get out of here!

416
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,090
I don't think so!

417
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:19,668
Seize that guy! Get the treasure!

418
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:20,468
Yes, sir!

419
00:27:20,681 --> 00:27:21,841
Whoa!

420
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:24,013
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

421
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:26,425
This treasure is mine!

422
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:30,934
It's captain Roger's treasure.
It must be something incredi...

423
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:39,446
The first one to grab the treasure chest
was one of the seven warlords,

424
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:43,242
the genius Jester buggy!
What could be in the...?

425
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,493
What the heck?!

426
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:55,040
What's going on?!

427
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:56,667
The bubble is...

428
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:02,507
I'm falling!

429
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:06,423
My treasure!

430
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:23,820
What the hell... is going on?!

431
00:28:25,996 --> 00:28:28,783
Hang on! Sunny!

432
00:28:33,337 --> 00:28:34,497
Luffy!

433
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:38,748
I don't wanna die yet!

434
00:28:40,886 --> 00:28:43,252
His "iron arm" hasn't changed.

435
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:48,808
The immense power trained
for 20 years within prison...

436
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:51,635
Make sure it gets delivered!

437
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:01,068
You okay, kid?!

438
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:03,112
High priest! Please hang on!

439
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:05,782
This is crazy...

440
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:06,699
Captain!

441
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:10,325
Relax, I don't see any shadows of death.

442
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:12,740
What the heck happened?!

443
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,665
Hang in there!

444
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:15,788
I thought I was dead!

445
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:19,041
Captain buggy!

446
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:25,381
All right! I did it! This
is the pirate king's...

447
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:29,681
This is... is this really...?!

448
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:36,184
A galleon ship suddenly flew over
to the island and destroyed it!

449
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:40,689
And where did the pirate
king's treasure go?!

450
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:43,987
Dammit, who the hell did that?!

451
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:44,608
Kid...

452
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:46,065
What?!

453
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:50,034
You're kidding me...

454
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:51,953
That's...

455
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,677
Usopp!

456
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:14,259
This sea is a battlefield.

457
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:15,479
Die.

458
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:17,976
What the hell are you doin'?!

459
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:26,907
Luffy!

460
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:28,524
You bastard!

461
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:37,787
You must be the one...
Who attacked tra-guy!

462
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:40,585
Oh? You're pretty tough.

463
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:43,083
This is looking awfully bad!

464
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,541
Who the hell is he?

465
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:46,967
Thought I was dead!

466
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:48,179
Oh, you're alive.

467
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:49,511
"Course I'm alive!

468
00:30:49,723 --> 00:30:54,183
Dammit! I dropped the treasure!
Who's responsible?

469
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:56,354
That's...

470
00:30:56,438 --> 00:30:57,803
You know him?

471
00:30:58,023 --> 00:31:04,064
Y-yeah... just like me, he used to be
a member of the Roger pirates...

472
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:06,019
His name is Douglas bullet.

473
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:10,198
He was a monster that was as strong
as rayleigh-San back then.

474
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:13,743
Rayleigh? You mean the pirate
king's right-hand man?!

475
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:19,374
Now, let's begin.

476
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,329
Wh-what was that?!

477
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:28,333
Wha...? Hey...

478
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:31,090
Emergency!

479
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:35,174
No way...! This festival was supposed
to be a complete secret!

480
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:39,228
Hey, festa-San! What happened to
your information control, huh?!

481
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:41,270
Hey... don't tell me...

482
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:45,567
I-1-it's a huge Navy fleet!

483
00:31:50,117 --> 00:31:51,117
Run!

484
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,319
Wait for me!

485
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:55,073
Who's the damn snitch?!

486
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:59,748
The first fleet of Navy warships has
arrived as planned to the open sea.

487
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,325
A message from the Navy fleet.

488
00:32:01,545 --> 00:32:04,457
"Siege complete. We appreciate
your cooperation.â€

489
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:06,629
Vice admiral momonga, eh...?

490
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:09,925
Now, what'cha gonna do, pirates?

491
00:32:10,137 --> 00:32:13,971
Face them... or run from them?

492
00:32:17,811 --> 00:32:22,726
Dammit! We were set up by festa!
He sold us out to the Navy!

493
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:25,603
Wha...? Hey, wait for me!

494
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:30,479
I see no openings...

495
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:33,156
It's not just the treasure he's after?

496
00:32:34,828 --> 00:32:36,068
Hey, you...

497
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:40,873
You messed with my friend.
You'd better be ready to deal with me.

498
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:42,949
Friend?

499
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:47,129
You mean this piece of scum who
couldn't protect a single treasure?

500
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:52,171
I hear the worst generation is strong...

501
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:55,129
If you all want this treasure...

502
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:57,304
Come at me.

503
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:04,938
Conqueror's haki!

504
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,356
Truly a demon...

505
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:07,808
This is whack!

506
00:33:08,028 --> 00:33:10,064
Bring it on!

507
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:35,879
What's the matter, worst generation?
Too scared to move?

508
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:47,189
You're fighting... me!

509
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:49,858
Zoro!

510
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:55,280
We'll get in touch with sanji-kun
and the others and prepare to escape!

511
00:33:55,492 --> 00:33:57,949
It won't be easy getting through
that many warships!

512
00:33:58,161 --> 00:33:59,776
We need a plan!

513
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:02,487
Leave usopp to me! You take care of sunny!

514
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:03,707
Roger that!

515
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:08,126
Senpais! Please let us help you, too!

516
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:10,249
Ugh! What is that?

517
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:11,465
You guys!

518
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:12,873
All right! Come with me!

519
00:34:13,093 --> 00:34:14,833
Zoro! Wrong direction!

520
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:15,667
A miracle?!

521
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,923
Zoro-senpai! You're the man!

522
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:21,222
I've come for you, too! Be grateful!

523
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:24,471
Run before you get dragged in!

524
00:34:24,688 --> 00:34:30,308
Ya damn old rookie! Don't get excited
just because you're out of your Coop!

525
00:34:30,527 --> 00:34:35,442
Come. I'll start with you guys.

526
00:34:38,118 --> 00:34:40,575
The stage is set...

527
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:42,948
There's a little over ten minutes left.

528
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:48,500
You're called "demon heir"...
Now, let me see your power.

529
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:50,919
Puru-puru-puru-puru-puru...

530
00:34:51,131 --> 00:34:53,338
Puru-puru-puru-puru-puru...

531
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:56,917
What is happening...? Usopp...!
Puru-puru-puru-puru-puru...

532
00:34:56,928 --> 00:35:00,671
Even the marines have snuck in... what's
going on? Puru-puru-puru-puru-puru...

533
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:08,310
Long time no see...

534
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:11,222
Miss all Sunday.

535
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:14,105
You're... crocodile!

536
00:35:14,321 --> 00:35:19,156
Color me surprised. If you're going
after it, too, then that treasure...

537
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:22,655
Must be something that
could shake the very world.

538
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:29,208
You are perceptive. Douglas bullet is
secretly involved with this festival.

539
00:35:29,419 --> 00:35:33,879
"The tragedy of galzburg"...
The pirate who caused that massacre?!

540
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:38,333
His power is a bit of a pain.

541
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:39,963
What do you want from me?

542
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:42,011
Not you...

543
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:46,967
I have business with you.

544
00:35:47,187 --> 00:35:50,805
I have a plan. Tag along.

545
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:04,030
Snoopin' around in a place
like this! What're ya up to?!

546
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:08,238
Back at you! A buster call?!
Are you guys insane?!

547
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:10,119
Huh? What're you talking about?!

548
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:11,791
Puru-puru-puru...

549
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:12,742
Click.

550
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:16,955
Smoker-San! It's an emergency!
Bullet has appeared and taken the treasure!

551
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:20,383
He's destroyed the island and is about
to engage in battle with the straw hats!

552
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:22,756
So he's started making his move...

553
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:24,758
Captain! Where are you going?!

554
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:26,430
I'm clearing out, of course!

555
00:36:26,643 --> 00:36:29,055
You're clearing out all those warships?!

556
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,431
Wow, captain buggy!

557
00:36:31,648 --> 00:36:34,060
How positive can they be?

558
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:39,360
Just him alone is worse
than facing a Navy fleet.

559
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:42,063
It's best not to get involved...

560
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:47,403
Even if that treasure happened
to be the "one piece."

561
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:57,503
You guys stay out of my way!

562
00:36:57,716 --> 00:37:00,173
I'm fighting him! And
you're next, straw hat!

563
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:02,717
I'm comin' if you aren't...

564
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:20,272
Demon face!

565
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:25,156
Boom!

566
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:26,778
Boom!

567
00:37:45,138 --> 00:37:47,220
What the...?

568
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:51,050
How pathetic! I'll finish you off
by turning you into a brat!

569
00:37:56,149 --> 00:38:00,734
Gum-gum... elephant gun!

570
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:06,572
Why, youl!

571
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:08,241
Don't get in my way!

572
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:11,195
Y'all are in my way!

573
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:13,325
Big father!

574
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:15,406
Wow!

575
00:38:33,937 --> 00:38:35,473
Boom, boom!

576
00:38:43,196 --> 00:38:45,437
Retribution!

577
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:52,072
Go to hell!

578
00:38:53,206 --> 00:38:58,701
Gum-gum... red hawk!

579
00:39:12,976 --> 00:39:14,967
Stop butting in, you guys!

580
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,677
That's my line!

581
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:29,781
Not bad... but not enough!

582
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:32,575
Training, tactics, determination...

583
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:35,449
You lack all of 'em...

584
00:39:35,665 --> 00:39:41,331
I'll show you what real,
refined power looks like!

585
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:49,922
You bastard...! What're you after?!

586
00:39:50,972 --> 00:39:54,055
To be the world's strongest!

587
00:39:54,267 --> 00:39:57,100
This is a nice, tense atmosphere.

588
00:39:57,312 --> 00:39:59,928
Don't die on me too easily.

589
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:12,982
Before luffy and usopp come back,

590
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:15,202
I'll reduce the number of warships
and make a path!

591
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,369
You look after the ship!

592
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:20,244
Zoro-senpai entrusted me with a mission!

593
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:24,499
Leave it to me! I'll
protect it with my life!

594
00:40:24,714 --> 00:40:28,423
Now... how do we open up a path...?

595
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:32,927
Aiyeeee! It's fujitora!

596
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:34,925
The admiral himself!

597
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:42,229
I've come to seek on my own
what kind of justice this battle holds.

598
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:47,730
Follow admiral fujitora!
Seize all the pirates!

599
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:51,905
Ugh! What do you guys want?!

600
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:55,950
Straw hats! You must...

601
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:57,368
Please save us!

602
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:00,617
As if! Go fight yourself!

603
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:04,082
I smell Robin!

604
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,080
Robin-chan!

605
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:06,081
Everyone!

606
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:08,959
Robin! I'm glad you're safe!

607
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:11,336
Thank you. Where's he?

608
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:16,342
Well... he was suddenly alarmed
and took off somewhere.

609
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:18,718
I wonder what that was all about.

610
00:41:18,935 --> 00:41:20,891
Hey, Robin-chan, where's law?

611
00:41:21,104 --> 00:41:23,140
About that...

612
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:30,776
All right, let's split into two teams.

613
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:32,069
Chopper and brook,

614
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:35,114
you guys go back and tell luffy
and the others about the buster call.

615
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:35,690
Okay. Yes.

616
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,070
Robin-chan, you come with me.

617
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:37,900
Okay.

618
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:41,454
Listen, everyone! Luffy will
definitely get that treasure.

619
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:43,782
We trust in that and act accordingly.

620
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:45,037
Got it! Yes!

621
00:41:50,967 --> 00:41:52,753
He's playin' around...

622
00:41:58,975 --> 00:42:04,470
This is the power of the man who'll
become the king of the pirates.

623
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:09,399
If your goal is to become
the king of the pirates...

624
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,566
Then I refuse to lose to you!

625
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:13,895
Fourth gear!

626
00:42:14,115 --> 00:42:16,276
Snake-man!

627
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:19,279
Using your devil fruit power
and a full blast of haki?

628
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:21,281
You won't last long like that.

629
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:23,362
Yeah, here goes!

630
00:42:26,294 --> 00:42:27,704
Run! Python!

631
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:32,254
Gum-gum... jet culverin!

632
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:37,710
Gum-gum...

633
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:40,012
Black mamba!

634
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:55,153
No wonder you've got a 1.5 billion
bounty... you've got some spunk!

635
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:03,536
What's the matter?! Finished already?!

636
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:08,116
Yeah! This'll finish you!

637
00:43:08,336 --> 00:43:10,201
Gum-gum...

638
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:13,003
Gimme your best shot! Straw hat!

639
00:43:13,216 --> 00:43:16,549
Show me your true power!

640
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:19,218
King cobra!

641
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:45,035
"Former crew member of
pirate king overwhelmed

642
00:43:45,248 --> 00:43:48,206
by the fifth emperor, straw hat luffy!"

643
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:50,248
This'll make a fine story!

644
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:54,454
Countin' on ya. This party's
just getting started.

645
00:43:54,674 --> 00:43:58,007
Standby! Brachio head! Change!

646
00:43:58,219 --> 00:44:01,837
Iron... pirate!

647
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:05,765
General... franky!

648
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:14,682
Run!

649
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:17,981
Don't let them escape!

650
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:25,656
What're you all tryin' to do
teamin' up with that guy?!

651
00:44:25,872 --> 00:44:28,739
That is beyond the extent of my knowledge.

652
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:33,122
Who knows whether the decision to start this
war will turn out to be worthwhile or not...

653
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:34,497
"War," you said?!

654
00:44:34,714 --> 00:44:37,205
Barrier bulls!

655
00:44:37,425 --> 00:44:40,383
Blade of beauty... Saint! ExupÃ©ry!

656
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:44,341
You think you can defeat me?!

657
00:44:44,557 --> 00:44:45,922
Get 'em, boss!

658
00:44:46,142 --> 00:44:47,678
Take this! Slow-slow bea...

659
00:44:47,894 --> 00:44:49,054
Shut the hell up!

660
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:51,386
Stop the ship!

661
00:44:54,734 --> 00:44:55,814
You!

662
00:44:56,027 --> 00:44:58,814
Our captain himself dove
onto the front lines!

663
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:00,986
Are there only idiots?

664
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:05,442
Everyone, here goes! Zeus breeze tempo!

665
00:45:18,758 --> 00:45:21,500
Not bad, straw hat...

666
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:24,506
I like strong guys.

667
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:27,589
But you and your men...

668
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:31,387
I'll kill you all...

669
00:45:31,604 --> 00:45:34,311
In order to become the strongest!

670
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:36,639
Go be the strongest someplace else!

671
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:39,976
You'd better not lay another
hand on my friends!

672
00:45:40,196 --> 00:45:42,107
You make me sick.

673
00:45:42,323 --> 00:45:44,484
This sea is a battlefield!

674
00:45:46,661 --> 00:45:49,824
Power is everything!

675
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:56,959
What's that?!

676
00:46:02,677 --> 00:46:05,794
This is my ship, the catapult.

677
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:10,632
It's filled with all sorts
of weapons and iron.

678
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:14,264
Union armada!

679
00:46:20,361 --> 00:46:21,851
A devil fruit power...

680
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:28,696
I am a combinable human
who ate the clank-clank fruit!

681
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:33,245
I can combine all kinds of objects
and transform them.

682
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:39,744
In addition to my own strength,
I've got the ultimate ability!

683
00:46:39,964 --> 00:46:42,501
On top of that strength,
he's a devil fruit power-user...?

684
00:46:42,717 --> 00:46:44,878
What's going to happen?

685
00:46:45,094 --> 00:46:48,086
The weak can't survive in this sea...

686
00:46:48,306 --> 00:46:52,345
Just like... that
long nose from earlier.

687
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:55,768
Cut off any useless men, straw hat.

688
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:58,392
How can you say that?!

689
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:02,020
Then who would I have parties with?!
Are you an idiot?!

690
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:05,148
The hopeless idiot here is you!

691
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:08,401
Your so-called "friends"
are just a weakness.

692
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:14,908
Even that monster geezer whitebeard
died for his own men.

693
00:47:15,124 --> 00:47:16,955
Same with Roger!

694
00:47:17,168 --> 00:47:20,205
Those who died are all losers!

695
00:47:20,421 --> 00:47:24,585
That's the limit of those
who cling to their "friends."

696
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:29,794
My strength exists only
for me and my victory!

697
00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:34,098
I won't lose to someone like that!

698
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:37,677
If you want to talk big,
why don't you take this back, kid?!

699
00:47:37,897 --> 00:47:40,354
I'll tell you all before you die...

700
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:44,150
This really is Roger's treasure!

701
00:47:44,362 --> 00:47:46,603
Inside this...

702
00:47:47,615 --> 00:47:50,573
Is the one piece!

703
00:47:53,621 --> 00:47:56,328
One... piece...

704
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:07,089
It ends here. Now, let me see you struggle!

705
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:11,631
Gravity blade! Raging tiger!

706
00:48:14,475 --> 00:48:16,966
1080-pound Phoenix!

707
00:48:20,648 --> 00:48:22,980
Ultra tiger hunt!

708
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:34,658
We're gonna escape before
the rest of the marines get here!

709
00:48:37,498 --> 00:48:38,738
Don't tell me...

710
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:44,000
A warlord... what a pain...

711
00:48:44,213 --> 00:48:47,296
Whatever. Pacifistas! Get the pirates!

712
00:48:47,508 --> 00:48:50,045
Negative hollow!

713
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:54,636
I'm sorry to have been born.

714
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:59,183
You're not very cute.

715
00:48:59,395 --> 00:49:00,475
What's that?!

716
00:49:00,688 --> 00:49:02,394
Who on earth...

717
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:06,144
Is blocking my path with a pirate ship?!

718
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,941
Hey, hey, isn't that...?

719
00:49:08,154 --> 00:49:10,611
The warlord and pirate empress...

720
00:49:10,823 --> 00:49:13,439
Boa hancock!

721
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:18,323
Whatever I do, the world will
always forgive my actions...

722
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:23,329
Because I am beautiful.

723
00:49:23,544 --> 00:49:26,832
If they're our allies, we have
nothing to fear! Go, warlords!

724
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:28,878
Silence! Where's luffy?!

725
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:30,376
Look, wow!

726
00:49:30,593 --> 00:49:32,709
Three current warlords are here!

727
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:37,797
Stupid idiots! I ain't staying for this!
Even nine lives wouldn't be enough!

728
00:49:38,017 --> 00:49:39,132
See yal!

729
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:45,138
The admirals and the warlords?!
You tryin' to start a war or something?

730
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:47,313
Close, but not quite.

731
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:48,766
As expected from the Navy...

732
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:53,275
They want that treasure after all, eh?

733
00:49:53,491 --> 00:49:56,779
It's over... you brats!

734
00:50:06,337 --> 00:50:07,497
Kid!

735
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:11,713
This will teach you!

736
00:50:11,926 --> 00:50:12,926
You guys!

737
00:50:13,052 --> 00:50:14,052
Killer!

738
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:15,459
You bastard...!

739
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:19,638
People can only reach this
level on their own...

740
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:25,223
And on this level, the
weak lose everything.

741
00:50:51,924 --> 00:50:59,924
Only one person, the strongest one, can
obtain everything this sea has to offer.

742
00:51:12,403 --> 00:51:15,520
An eternal pose to laugh tale?!

743
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:21,200
Such a thing exists?! It's a huge
scoop that'll flip the world!

744
00:51:22,371 --> 00:51:23,486
That's right.

745
00:51:23,706 --> 00:51:29,076
The treasure is a guide to the island
laugh tale, where the one piece sleeps.

746
00:51:29,295 --> 00:51:31,877
The shortcut to becoming
the king of the pirates

747
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:34,831
that dumb Roger and his
crew buried in darkness...

748
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:39,214
I found it! And with this,
I'll change the times.

749
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:42,172
I'll spark a festival of madness!

750
00:51:43,726 --> 00:51:45,432
Die.

751
00:51:53,861 --> 00:51:57,274
You're still... fighting me!

752
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:00,981
What's all this?

753
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:05,907
Not only are you weak, but stupid, too, eh?

754
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:18,253
My captain is risking his life for me!

755
00:52:18,469 --> 00:52:20,926
I can't be nappin' here!

756
00:52:22,014 --> 00:52:27,975
The weaker the dog is, the stupider
he is, and the more he barks.

757
00:52:33,317 --> 00:52:36,229
Festivals equal "madness."

758
00:52:36,445 --> 00:52:38,060
We will plunge...

759
00:52:39,073 --> 00:52:42,440
The world into madness like no other.

760
00:52:43,494 --> 00:52:45,985
Into a stampede!

761
00:52:47,373 --> 00:52:49,659
We'll show ya...

762
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:54,960
Hmm... what a sight it's becoming...

763
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:57,254
Admiral! I have a report, sir!

764
00:52:59,468 --> 00:53:03,928
So it came out... the
pirate king's treasure...

765
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:06,551
Seize the pirates!

766
00:53:06,767 --> 00:53:09,850
We came all the way here!
We ain't going down!

767
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:22,438
One! Two! Django!

768
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:27,451
Kimono sleeve cage!

769
00:53:27,663 --> 00:53:28,823
Lock!

770
00:53:35,129 --> 00:53:38,121
Don't bother with the shrimps!
We'll get bullet! Gimme a hand, hina!

771
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:41,173
Smoker-kun! Why are you dressed like that?!

772
00:53:41,385 --> 00:53:44,047
Smoker-San!

773
00:53:44,263 --> 00:53:45,469
What on earth is going on?!

774
00:53:45,681 --> 00:53:48,263
Hq is keeping somethin' from us!

775
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:49,009
What?

776
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:55,563
Depending on what Roger's treasure is,
the higher-ups may make an insane decision.

777
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:57,389
You're acting on your own again?!

778
00:53:57,609 --> 00:53:59,975
Move! Marine!

779
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:01,901
Fulfill your duty here!

780
00:54:02,114 --> 00:54:04,070
No need to tell me.

781
00:54:05,409 --> 00:54:07,240
Outta the way!

782
00:54:07,453 --> 00:54:09,694
What the hell?!

783
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:13,781
You pirates are all... under arrest!

784
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:15,787
Whoa! Buggyyyn!

785
00:54:16,003 --> 00:54:17,003
You're...

786
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:19,373
What're you doin', ya flashy idiot?!

787
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:21,205
Crap! The Navy!

788
00:54:21,425 --> 00:54:25,213
Wait. I'm buggy, a warlord!
What do you think you're doing?!

789
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:28,421
Y-you! You looked inside that
treasure chest, didn't you?!

790
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:29,129
What?!

791
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:31,340
What was the treasure?!

792
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:34,677
Who cares about that right now?!

793
00:54:34,897 --> 00:54:37,604
What's important right
now is our own lives!

794
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:39,522
What's the treasure?! Spit it out! Now!

795
00:54:39,735 --> 00:54:40,735
I can't breathe...!

796
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:41,944
Smoker-San?!

797
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:45,696
Stop, I got it! I'll talk, I'll talk!
It's an eternal pose!

798
00:54:45,908 --> 00:54:48,775
An eternal pose to laugh tale!

799
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:49,994
Say what?!

800
00:54:50,204 --> 00:54:52,946
Charge! Seize the pirates!

801
00:55:00,339 --> 00:55:04,298
It seems that the course of the war is
about to turn. Let us hold off our battle.

802
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:05,590
Huh?!

803
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:12,089
This is a parting gift.

804
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:13,640
Hold it right there!

805
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:21,264
What the hell?!

806
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:23,896
A meteor?!

807
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:26,899
Retreat! Retreat!

808
00:55:27,115 --> 00:55:29,071
That's too huge!

809
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:32,822
The nine mountains and eight seas
constitute one world!

810
00:55:33,038 --> 00:55:35,529
A thousand of them form a small chiliocosm!

811
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:38,957
And when I gather and cube that chiliocosm,
there's nothing I can't cut!

812
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:41,251
Three-sword style secret technique!

813
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:45,502
The billion-fold world...

814
00:55:47,928 --> 00:55:50,294
Trichiliocosm!

815
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:55,341
Zoro-senpail

816
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:01,563
zoro-senpail

817
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:03,231
will I make it?!

818
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:12,198
Whaaaaat?!

819
00:56:19,251 --> 00:56:21,788
Anything beyond this is
outside of my contract.

820
00:56:22,713 --> 00:56:23,953
Let's go, ghost girl.

821
00:56:24,172 --> 00:56:25,958
Don't order me around!

822
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:28,506
And next time you decide to
slice a meteor, tell me first!

823
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:30,801
That scared me.

824
00:56:31,013 --> 00:56:32,128
We have to hurry!

825
00:56:32,347 --> 00:56:35,510
Luffy-San! Where are you?!

826
00:56:35,726 --> 00:56:39,344
Usopp! Where are you?!

827
00:56:49,907 --> 00:56:52,023
Ready! Fire!

828
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:56,694
It's time... Navy...

829
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:04,035
Now... it's showtime!

830
00:57:14,932 --> 00:57:18,470
Pull out your soldiers and ships now!
He's trying to gather us and...

831
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:20,425
Too late!

832
00:57:20,646 --> 00:57:26,186
Have a good taste... of my awakened powers!

833
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:35,232
What's that?!

834
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:40,579
Though it's rare, devil fruit
powers sometimes awaken

835
00:57:40,791 --> 00:57:44,750
and start affecting things other
than the users themselves.

836
00:57:51,343 --> 00:57:52,128
What's that?!

837
00:57:52,344 --> 00:57:54,255
What's going on?!

838
00:58:10,195 --> 00:58:12,106
He's targeting the ships!

839
00:58:40,809 --> 00:58:43,300
It's enormous...!

840
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,260
What now?!

841
00:58:53,405 --> 00:58:55,145
What?! Don't tell me...

842
00:58:56,742 --> 00:58:59,404
He's trying to confine us on the island!

843
00:59:01,038 --> 00:59:02,323
Luffy...!

844
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:06,956
What're you gonna do now, Navy?

845
00:59:07,169 --> 00:59:09,911
You've got only one choice!

846
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:13,045
Die...

847
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:27,844
The vice admirals are down in one hit?!

848
00:59:32,194 --> 00:59:33,194
Run!

849
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:34,859
A mountain's gonna drop!

850
00:59:35,072 --> 00:59:40,783
Ultimate... fist!

851
00:59:49,044 --> 00:59:51,660
The island split!

852
00:59:54,382 --> 00:59:56,043
Twenty-four years ago,

853
00:59:56,259 --> 01:00:01,299
I lost to the Navy and was imprisoned
in impel down. I asked myself then,

854
01:00:01,515 --> 01:00:06,430
"how can I obtain power so overwhelming
that I'll never lose again?

855
01:00:06,645 --> 01:00:11,856
How can I surpass Roger and
become the world's strongest?"

856
01:00:13,068 --> 01:00:18,563
Fleet admiral! The eternal pose
to the one piece is right here!

857
01:00:18,782 --> 01:00:22,775
Come and defeat me just like back then!

858
01:00:30,919 --> 01:00:33,285
The treasure is there, eh?

859
01:00:33,505 --> 01:00:36,121
What the heck's going on?!

860
01:00:36,341 --> 01:00:40,425
To think that he's swallowed hundreds
of pirate ships and warships

861
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:41,797
with his awakened power...

862
01:00:42,013 --> 01:00:44,720
The biggest problem is that haki.

863
01:00:44,933 --> 01:00:49,393
He's coated that gigantic body
with powerful armament haki.

864
01:00:49,604 --> 01:00:52,471
What tremendous power...

865
01:00:54,025 --> 01:00:56,016
At this rate...

866
01:00:57,612 --> 01:01:00,024
He's a devil fruit power-user...
Which means...

867
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:03,949
If luffy beats that guy,
this wall should go away!

868
01:01:04,161 --> 01:01:07,198
Then we'll have to...

869
01:01:07,414 --> 01:01:09,780
Uncle! What the hell's going on?!

870
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,662
Bullet still has the
pirate king's treasure!

871
01:01:12,878 --> 01:01:17,212
And he has swallowed our
warships and... ahhhh!

872
01:01:17,424 --> 01:01:18,880
Click.

873
01:01:19,092 --> 01:01:22,880
He didn't have to tell me. I can see it.

874
01:01:23,096 --> 01:01:25,257
A call from the fleet admiral, sir!

875
01:01:25,473 --> 01:01:28,260
I see... he's awakened, eh?

876
01:01:28,476 --> 01:01:32,094
So he's built up that much power...

877
01:01:32,314 --> 01:01:35,181
Borsalino...

878
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:38,938
Troublemakers are on the move, too.

879
01:01:39,154 --> 01:01:43,739
Evil must be eradicated
thoroughly and completely.

880
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:48,569
As he wishes... let's
give him a buster call!

881
01:01:51,082 --> 01:01:52,162
Marvelous!

882
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:55,788
You sure are one hell of a guy, bullet!

883
01:01:56,004 --> 01:01:59,041
I was right to bet the
rest of my life on you.

884
01:01:59,257 --> 01:02:02,670
That bastard Roger launched
the best festival called

885
01:02:02,886 --> 01:02:06,595
the "dawn of the great pirate era."

886
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:11,971
Even I, the festival master,
had no way to top that.

887
01:02:12,187 --> 01:02:15,554
But... with you, I can create a new era.

888
01:02:15,774 --> 01:02:19,813
I can destroy this stupid era.

889
01:02:20,028 --> 01:02:25,193
I'll surpass that bastard Roger completely!

890
01:02:30,622 --> 01:02:33,614
C'mon, I know you can do better, Navy!

891
01:02:33,833 --> 01:02:40,420
I expect more from your new fleet admiral!

892
01:02:40,632 --> 01:02:42,213
He's really done it!

893
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:45,258
A buster call is a symbol
of the world government.

894
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:50,214
And the great pirate Douglas bullet
is trying to surpass it all by himself!

895
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:54,472
What an epic revenge battle!
It's a huge scoop!

896
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:59,515
Now... all you underground trash...

897
01:03:00,652 --> 01:03:05,066
With the key to the one piece, the eternal
pose to laugh tale, in our hands,

898
01:03:05,282 --> 01:03:06,738
we are...

899
01:03:07,993 --> 01:03:11,281
Going to kill you and all the pirates!

900
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:13,407
S... say what?!

901
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:14,783
What's he saying?!

902
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:15,739
Explain!

903
01:03:15,959 --> 01:03:20,043
The era of gold Roger will come to an end.

904
01:03:20,255 --> 01:03:26,751
The great pirate era that shook up
the world is now in the past!

905
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:32,181
From here on, I, buena festa, will create
the hysteria of a new grand war

906
01:03:32,392 --> 01:03:36,476
that will rock the entire world!

907
01:03:36,688 --> 01:03:41,182
If you want the treasure, take it!
Steal it from us!

908
01:03:41,401 --> 01:03:45,770
Everything the world has
to offer is within our hands!

909
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:48,154
Damn you!

910
01:03:48,366 --> 01:03:49,856
Are you insane?!

911
01:03:51,411 --> 01:03:53,242
Anger is also...

912
01:03:57,083 --> 01:03:58,448
See this, Roger?

913
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:03,913
I will end this dull era of treasure
hunting that you started.

914
01:04:04,132 --> 01:04:06,339
The treasure is right here!

915
01:04:06,551 --> 01:04:08,542
They'll fight over it and shed blood!

916
01:04:08,762 --> 01:04:11,094
A festival in which only the strong win!

917
01:04:11,306 --> 01:04:16,846
That's the new era... I will create!

918
01:04:17,062 --> 01:04:19,303
A full-scale war with us, the Navy...

919
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:23,185
And a declaration of war
on all the world's pirates...

920
01:04:23,401 --> 01:04:26,859
It appears that their goal is to
destroy the order of this sea

921
01:04:27,072 --> 01:04:30,815
and plunge the world into a state of war.

922
01:04:31,034 --> 01:04:33,241
Douglas bullet, pirate...

923
01:04:33,453 --> 01:04:37,412
A war orphan born in the grand line's
militarist nation "galzburg."

924
01:04:37,624 --> 01:04:41,867
While young, he became a soldier
so great that he was called a hero.

925
01:04:42,087 --> 01:04:45,500
However, he was betrayed by
the military that trained him.

926
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:48,331
That distress pushed bullet into
inciting a wide-scale massacre

927
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:50,837
that put an end to the nation itself.

928
01:04:51,054 --> 01:04:52,760
After that, he took to the sea

929
01:04:56,017 --> 01:05:00,681
but for some reason, he joined Roger's crew
and further increased his notoriety.

930
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:05,641
Due to his brutality, sengoku-San,
the admiral at the time...

931
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:11,772
Betrayed by grownups...
And betrayed by friends...

932
01:05:11,991 --> 01:05:18,408
His lonesome upbringing made him
continue to fight without trusting others.

933
01:05:18,623 --> 01:05:25,040
But Roger taught him
defeat and took him in.

934
01:05:25,130 --> 01:05:25,289
N n avy n

935
01:05:25,296 --> 01:05:29,380
"Navy" soon, bullet was called the "demon
heir," carrying on Roger's strength.

936
01:05:29,384 --> 01:05:29,588
N n avy n

937
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:32,379
"Navy" he continued to fight,
hoping to surpass him...

938
01:05:32,387 --> 01:05:32,921
He continued to fight,
hoping to surpass him...

939
01:05:33,138 --> 01:05:35,174
But then Roger died.

940
01:05:35,390 --> 01:05:40,976
Bullet lost his way and began
to destroy everything in sight.

941
01:05:41,187 --> 01:05:45,931
He was a monster that lost
his goal of beating Roger.

942
01:05:46,151 --> 01:05:49,109
We couldn't let him run wild...

943
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:54,360
So we ordered a buster call,
just to capture him.

944
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:03,406
We cannot sympathize with him.

945
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:07,915
We must prevent a war that will involve
the entire world at all costs.

946
01:06:08,131 --> 01:06:09,792
You're right...

947
01:06:10,008 --> 01:06:15,719
We must shed a lot of blood one more
time to put an end to him for good.

948
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:23,848
Or is there another way to confront
him head-on, just as Roger did?

949
01:06:34,365 --> 01:06:36,572
See that, luffy?

950
01:06:36,784 --> 01:06:43,826
That bastard... faced with my power,
he turned tail and ran.

951
01:06:46,377 --> 01:06:48,493
Let's let him go...

952
01:06:49,756 --> 01:06:52,122
For today...

953
01:07:01,851 --> 01:07:04,888
Don't die... luffy!

954
01:07:05,104 --> 01:07:10,064
Our journey... can't possibly...

955
01:07:12,987 --> 01:07:15,023
End here!

956
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:24,237
We can't let it end... like this!

957
01:07:26,125 --> 01:07:31,961
Luffy... is gonna become
the king of the pirates!

958
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:41,671
The chill of the underworld, soul solid!

959
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:43,472
Usopp!

960
01:07:44,811 --> 01:07:46,392
You okay?!

961
01:07:46,604 --> 01:07:49,687
This is bad... I'll treat you right away!

962
01:07:50,692 --> 01:07:53,525
Treat... luffy first...

963
01:07:53,736 --> 01:07:56,603
He lost... too much blood...

964
01:07:56,823 --> 01:07:59,530
But, usopp! You're also...

965
01:08:00,785 --> 01:08:02,525
Please!

966
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:06,529
Okay.

967
01:08:08,167 --> 01:08:11,159
Robin-chan, let's hurry!
This place won't last long!

968
01:08:11,379 --> 01:08:13,620
I found it! If we have this...

969
01:08:21,055 --> 01:08:27,517
Attention! A message from
admiral kizaru! All units pull out!

970
01:08:27,729 --> 01:08:29,936
He ordered a complete withdrawal
within five minutes!

971
01:08:30,148 --> 01:08:32,560
Return immediately to the remaining ships!

972
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:34,003
Pull out!
Quickly! Return to the ships! Pull out!

973
01:08:34,027 --> 01:08:36,484
What's going on?! Does
he see the situation?!

974
01:08:36,696 --> 01:08:38,357
Please hurry and return to the ships!

975
01:08:38,573 --> 01:08:42,316
Admiral kizaru ordered a buster call!

976
01:08:42,535 --> 01:08:43,535
Say what?!

977
01:08:43,578 --> 01:08:46,160
The admiral's second fleet
is on standby at sea

978
01:08:46,372 --> 01:08:49,079
and will begin a barrage of
Cannon fire in five minutes!

979
01:08:49,292 --> 01:08:50,532
In five minutes?!

980
01:08:50,752 --> 01:08:52,788
You will die if you stay!

981
01:08:53,004 --> 01:08:55,916
Please evacuate immediately
to the remaining ships!

982
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:57,132
Is he insane?!

983
01:08:57,342 --> 01:09:01,756
Attention! Pull out completely
within five minutes!

984
01:09:04,849 --> 01:09:06,385
Retreat! Pull out!

985
01:09:06,601 --> 01:09:08,557
Five minutes isn't enough
to reach the ships!

986
01:09:08,770 --> 01:09:10,761
What's going on?! Hurry!

987
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:12,311
D-don't push!

988
01:09:14,233 --> 01:09:15,268
Finally...

989
01:09:15,485 --> 01:09:18,397
A buster call is used to
annihilate everything.

990
01:09:18,613 --> 01:09:23,482
I'll completely crush it and
rise to the world's strongest!

991
01:09:23,701 --> 01:09:26,784
You are next, four emperors!

992
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:29,453
Roger!

993
01:09:31,042 --> 01:09:34,079
Smoker-kun! We must evacuate now!

994
01:09:34,295 --> 01:09:35,580
Go on ahead.

995
01:09:35,797 --> 01:09:36,161
What?

996
01:09:36,381 --> 01:09:38,212
What?! I'll stay, too!

997
01:09:38,424 --> 01:09:39,834
I can still fight as well!

998
01:09:40,051 --> 01:09:42,918
Uh... m-me, too.

999
01:09:47,266 --> 01:09:49,177
Such a fool...

1000
01:09:50,436 --> 01:09:52,518
Huh?! Hina-San! Let me go!

1001
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:54,266
Vice admiral smoker!

1002
01:09:54,482 --> 01:09:56,564
Smoker-San!

1003
01:10:01,989 --> 01:10:04,822
If I take back that treasure from bullet,

1004
01:10:05,034 --> 01:10:10,495
I can stop this stupid operation that
wipes out everyone, including our men.

1005
01:10:11,457 --> 01:10:13,914
You rotten pirate!

1006
01:10:14,127 --> 01:10:16,539
You think you can do whatever you want?!

1007
01:10:16,754 --> 01:10:17,869
Heat haze!

1008
01:10:23,344 --> 01:10:26,632
I agree that we should
take him down, marine.

1009
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:30,427
But you think you can win all on your own?

1010
01:10:30,643 --> 01:10:35,558
You're from the revolutionary army!
If I remember right, you're straw hat's...

1011
01:10:35,773 --> 01:10:42,269
You know luffy? Take it easy on him.
He's my little brother.

1012
01:10:42,488 --> 01:10:44,604
Don't interfere!

1013
01:10:47,994 --> 01:10:49,200
Retreat!

1014
01:10:49,412 --> 01:10:52,119
Hurry! Pull out!

1015
01:10:52,331 --> 01:10:55,118
Hey, look at the Navy. They're panicking.

1016
01:10:57,086 --> 01:10:58,872
What should we do?!

1017
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:01,374
Luffy and the others will
definitely come back!

1018
01:11:01,591 --> 01:11:04,424
Just believe in them and
think of what you can do now!

1019
01:11:04,635 --> 01:11:06,876
You're so cool! Nami-senpail

1020
01:11:07,096 --> 01:11:08,677
just get a move on already!

1021
01:11:08,890 --> 01:11:10,426
Ye s, ma'am!

1022
01:11:13,686 --> 01:11:17,224
Oh, luffy, I'm worried...
Is there some kind of a clue?

1023
01:11:20,109 --> 01:11:21,189
Luffy's clothes?!

1024
01:11:21,402 --> 01:11:24,109
Luffy! Is it you, luffy?! Hang in there!

1025
01:11:24,322 --> 01:11:26,358
Luffy!

1026
01:11:26,574 --> 01:11:26,983
Huh?

1027
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:28,485
Huh?

1028
01:11:29,452 --> 01:11:30,452
Who the hell are you?!

1029
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:33,236
Ahhhhhh!

1030
01:11:39,504 --> 01:11:41,586
Chopper... brook...

1031
01:11:41,798 --> 01:11:43,629
Luffy! You're awake!

1032
01:11:43,841 --> 01:11:47,425
We found you and usopp half-dead
after he dragged you out of there!

1033
01:11:47,637 --> 01:11:49,969
What on earth happened?!

1034
01:11:50,181 --> 01:11:51,671
We heard their plan!

1035
01:11:51,891 --> 01:11:55,930
At this rate, a buster call will
be carried out on this island.

1036
01:11:56,145 --> 01:12:00,684
That guy's gotten huge and
is going wild with crazy powers.

1037
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:03,232
And we still haven't gotten
ahold of the others...

1038
01:12:03,444 --> 01:12:06,311
Thanks, chopper. I'm fine now.

1039
01:12:06,531 --> 01:12:07,896
What?

1040
01:12:08,115 --> 01:12:09,980
But, luffy...

1041
01:12:10,201 --> 01:12:12,943
You guys head on back to the sunny.

1042
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:16,199
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

1043
01:12:16,415 --> 01:12:17,871
L-luffy...

1044
01:12:18,084 --> 01:12:19,494
Usopp?!

1045
01:12:22,213 --> 01:12:23,453
Luffy...

1046
01:12:23,673 --> 01:12:27,461
Usopp! You saved me, thanks!
I almost got...

1047
01:12:27,677 --> 01:12:29,042
I'm ss o rry!

1048
01:12:31,848 --> 01:12:34,931
When it's... really important...

1049
01:12:35,142 --> 01:12:39,226
I'm... useless!

1050
01:12:40,815 --> 01:12:43,648
I'm not strong enough at all!

1051
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:46,101
Dammit!

1052
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:49,403
I'm sorry... everyone!

1053
01:12:49,615 --> 01:12:50,354
Usopp!

1054
01:12:50,575 --> 01:12:51,815
Usopp-San! Hang in there!

1055
01:12:52,034 --> 01:12:53,615
Hey, don't speak anymore!

1056
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:57,946
Chopper, take care of usopp.

1057
01:12:58,165 --> 01:12:59,496
Huh, luffy?!

1058
01:13:04,046 --> 01:13:07,914
You haven't... lost to him yet!

1059
01:13:13,514 --> 01:13:16,756
Bullet!

1060
01:13:24,358 --> 01:13:27,816
Considering our powers,
this fight will never end!

1061
01:13:28,029 --> 01:13:31,237
I don't have time to be dealin' with you!

1062
01:13:31,449 --> 01:13:34,111
You two! Get outta the way!

1063
01:13:39,332 --> 01:13:40,572
Thank you for leading the way.

1064
01:13:40,791 --> 01:13:43,783
Do you two know luffy's whereabouts?!

1065
01:13:44,003 --> 01:13:45,789
Warlords!

1066
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:54,464
What the hell?! What are
all of you guys doing here?!

1067
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:56,170
Don't get so worked up.

1068
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:59,723
I just want to scare him
out of his wits, that's all.

1069
01:13:59,936 --> 01:14:00,641
Huh?!

1070
01:14:00,853 --> 01:14:03,390
I've got business with the
mastermind of this festival.

1071
01:14:03,606 --> 01:14:06,973
Hey, hey! What're ya wastin'
time for, ya big morons?!

1072
01:14:07,193 --> 01:14:09,033
We'll be killed if we
don't escape right away!

1073
01:14:09,236 --> 01:14:12,228
All of you! What are you
rambling on about?!

1074
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:15,155
I asked you about luffy's whereabouts!

1075
01:14:15,368 --> 01:14:18,235
What's your damage?! Get
your foot off of me!

1076
01:14:20,039 --> 01:14:22,746
All of you, stop interfering!

1077
01:14:22,959 --> 01:14:24,870
We're out of time!

1078
01:14:25,086 --> 01:14:27,418
So our available forces are
not a unified front, eh?

1079
01:14:27,630 --> 01:14:28,630
Huh?!

1080
01:14:28,673 --> 01:14:30,959
All of you, listen to me
if you don't want to die.

1081
01:14:31,175 --> 01:14:34,292
I got a plan to drag him
out of his giant body.

1082
01:14:34,512 --> 01:14:35,877
Ya flashy idiot!

1083
01:14:36,097 --> 01:14:39,931
We gotta run right away because
we don't wanna die! Are ya stup...?

1084
01:14:40,142 --> 01:14:43,555
My strength... dammit...
You've got a sea prism stone?

1085
01:14:43,771 --> 01:14:45,102
Continue.

1086
01:14:45,314 --> 01:14:48,727
We'll only get one shot.
His punch can split the island.

1087
01:14:48,943 --> 01:14:50,433
If we fail, we die.

1088
01:14:50,653 --> 01:14:53,611
You're asking me to risk my life
over some pirate's dumb idea?!

1089
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:54,858
You gotta be kidding!

1090
01:14:55,074 --> 01:14:56,860
But there's no other way.

1091
01:14:57,076 --> 01:14:58,907
It's out of the question!

1092
01:15:00,955 --> 01:15:01,955
Is that...?

1093
01:15:02,164 --> 01:15:03,700
Luffy!

1094
01:15:05,167 --> 01:15:07,579
Bullet!

1095
01:15:12,925 --> 01:15:15,086
So you are alive, straw hat...

1096
01:15:15,302 --> 01:15:17,839
That's what I'm talking about!

1097
01:15:18,055 --> 01:15:23,391
Gum-gum... Kong gun!

1098
01:15:35,906 --> 01:15:38,522
The hell are ya doin'?!

1099
01:15:39,702 --> 01:15:41,658
Luffy!

1100
01:15:41,871 --> 01:15:44,453
Luffy! I wanted to see you!
That was a strong punch!

1101
01:15:44,665 --> 01:15:45,745
Are you hurt anywhere?!

1102
01:15:45,958 --> 01:15:50,247
Hancock! Long time no see! How ya been?

1103
01:15:50,463 --> 01:15:53,626
He's worried about me more than himself!

1104
01:15:53,841 --> 01:15:55,797
I can die happy!

1105
01:15:56,010 --> 01:15:58,547
Oh, tra-guy! Glad you're okay!

1106
01:15:58,763 --> 01:16:00,344
No need to worry about me.

1107
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:03,593
Straw hat-ya, I got a plan to drag him out.

1108
01:16:03,809 --> 01:16:05,891
Really? Let's do it!

1109
01:16:08,856 --> 01:16:10,847
Hey! I'm not done explaining it yet!

1110
01:16:11,067 --> 01:16:12,648
Sabo! Smokey!

1111
01:16:12,860 --> 01:16:14,191
Yo, luffy!

1112
01:16:14,403 --> 01:16:15,609
All right, let's do it!

1113
01:16:15,821 --> 01:16:19,234
Straw hat-ya! You could die if we fail!

1114
01:16:19,450 --> 01:16:20,735
Don't worry.

1115
01:16:20,951 --> 01:16:22,907
All of us here will do it together, right?

1116
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:25,736
Then it'll definitely work!

1117
01:16:28,209 --> 01:16:32,077
I'll leave the details to you,
tra-guy. I just wanna...

1118
01:16:33,672 --> 01:16:36,209
Defeat him!

1119
01:16:36,425 --> 01:16:38,416
Dammit! All right, fine!

1120
01:16:38,636 --> 01:16:42,254
I will follow you to the ends of the earth.

1121
01:16:43,182 --> 01:16:45,764
Guess there's no time to hesitate...

1122
01:16:47,853 --> 01:16:49,184
Let's do it!

1123
01:17:09,166 --> 01:17:14,286
The hell is that?! Pirates, a marine,
warlords, and the revolutionary army?!

1124
01:17:14,505 --> 01:17:18,999
It'll take a lot more than a ragtag group
like that to change things!

1125
01:17:27,643 --> 01:17:29,634
Wait! Straw hat-ya!

1126
01:17:29,854 --> 01:17:30,854
Luffy!

1127
01:17:31,063 --> 01:17:33,429
Bullet!

1128
01:17:33,649 --> 01:17:36,937
That idiot! He didn't even hear the plan!

1129
01:17:37,153 --> 01:17:39,565
So, what's the plan?

1130
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:42,021
Bullet's abnormal haki is the problem,

1131
01:17:42,241 --> 01:17:45,950
but I'll use my powers to
create a crack in his haki.

1132
01:17:46,162 --> 01:17:49,620
You guys attack that and
whittle down his body.

1133
01:17:49,832 --> 01:17:51,993
Then what?

1134
01:17:52,209 --> 01:17:55,372
The fewer things he controls,
the weaker he gets.

1135
01:17:55,588 --> 01:17:59,206
So we'll finish him off together
before he starts absorbing them again.

1136
01:17:59,425 --> 01:18:01,541
I can make the crack only once.

1137
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:05,127
Why do I have to team
up with these idiots?!

1138
01:18:05,347 --> 01:18:08,009
Gum-gum...

1139
01:18:12,188 --> 01:18:16,352
You'll need more than
pluck to beat me... kid!

1140
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:24,359
Luffy!

1141
01:18:27,536 --> 01:18:31,154
That idiot...! Does he ever learn?!

1142
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:35,032
Dammit! He really is strong!

1143
01:18:35,252 --> 01:18:37,413
I can't beat him this way!

1144
01:18:37,630 --> 01:18:38,961
Then I'll...

1145
01:18:39,173 --> 01:18:44,338
You're an insignificant
bunch, but fine by me.

1146
01:18:44,553 --> 01:18:48,762
The Navy, pirates... anyone who
dares to stand against me...

1147
01:18:48,974 --> 01:18:51,386
I will eradicate every last one of them!

1148
01:18:51,602 --> 01:18:55,766
Not even Roger could do that.
Then all will know...

1149
01:18:55,981 --> 01:18:59,849
That I'm the world's strongest!

1150
01:19:00,069 --> 01:19:01,149
Scatter!

1151
01:19:02,446 --> 01:19:06,189
Follow straw hat-ya! When I use
my power, that's the sign!

1152
01:19:10,537 --> 01:19:13,028
I'm counting on you, luffy's friend!

1153
01:19:13,249 --> 01:19:15,160
I ain't his friend!

1154
01:19:16,460 --> 01:19:19,076
You sure this is really gonna work?

1155
01:19:20,714 --> 01:19:24,582
You're taking your sweet-ass time,
you damn useless kids...

1156
01:19:24,802 --> 01:19:28,715
As we planned, I'll provoke his
transformation. And that's when...

1157
01:19:28,931 --> 01:19:30,011
Hey!

1158
01:19:30,224 --> 01:19:32,431
Not just once, but twice...

1159
01:19:32,643 --> 01:19:34,804
How dare you strike my beloved!

1160
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:37,932
Unforgivable...! This is unforgivable!

1161
01:19:38,148 --> 01:19:40,560
Damn! Every last one of 'em...!

1162
01:19:47,950 --> 01:19:51,488
Perfume femur... magna!

1163
01:19:55,416 --> 01:19:57,452
His body is so tough!

1164
01:20:01,338 --> 01:20:06,753
I'll crush all of you... in one blow!

1165
01:20:06,969 --> 01:20:08,505
Empress-ya! Good work!

1166
01:20:08,721 --> 01:20:09,927
Idiot...!

1167
01:20:10,139 --> 01:20:12,425
Ground death!

1168
01:20:15,894 --> 01:20:17,850
Sables!

1169
01:20:30,659 --> 01:20:32,274
Crocodile?!

1170
01:20:32,494 --> 01:20:35,827
How many decades has it
been, ya heap of junk?!

1171
01:20:37,082 --> 01:20:41,746
Interesting! You can die here, too!

1172
01:20:41,962 --> 01:20:43,168
Room!

1173
01:20:46,842 --> 01:20:48,423
Shambles!

1174
01:20:48,635 --> 01:20:49,715
What?!

1175
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:55,301
How pathetic.

1176
01:20:55,517 --> 01:20:58,008
The real fight starts here!

1177
01:20:58,228 --> 01:21:01,595
This is the only thing that
can surpass his power!

1178
01:21:10,074 --> 01:21:13,783
A petty trick like this won't stop me!

1179
01:21:13,994 --> 01:21:16,110
I'll just absorb all the debris

1180
01:21:16,330 --> 01:21:19,538
and coat myself with haki.
That'll be the end for you!

1181
01:21:20,626 --> 01:21:21,741
There it is!

1182
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:23,621
Now, marine! Let's go!

1183
01:21:23,837 --> 01:21:25,702
Don't order me around!

1184
01:21:27,716 --> 01:21:30,207
White blow!

1185
01:21:31,387 --> 01:21:35,801
Burning dragon claw fist!
Flame dragon king!

1186
01:21:46,527 --> 01:21:47,527
What?!

1187
01:21:47,653 --> 01:21:48,653
All right!

1188
01:21:48,821 --> 01:21:50,311
You little...!

1189
01:21:50,531 --> 01:21:52,442
C'mon, don't be so angry.

1190
01:21:54,451 --> 01:21:56,567
You're wasting your time!

1191
01:22:02,668 --> 01:22:04,659
Ow, ow, ow... dammit!

1192
01:22:04,878 --> 01:22:06,414
The hell was all that about?

1193
01:22:06,630 --> 01:22:10,464
Oh, yeah! Straw hat! That damn rubber man!
How dare he mess with me!

1194
01:22:10,676 --> 01:22:14,385
Who does he think I am?!
I'm an almighty warlord!

1195
01:22:14,596 --> 01:22:17,258
I'll find him and beat
the crap out of... hm?

1196
01:22:17,474 --> 01:22:19,055
Huh? Eeeeeeek!

1197
01:22:19,268 --> 01:22:21,133
What the hell is this?! Give me a break!

1198
01:22:21,353 --> 01:22:24,436
I can't die yet! I climbed all the
way up to become a warlord!

1199
01:22:24,648 --> 01:22:27,230
Buggy-sama's legend has just begun!

1200
01:22:27,443 --> 01:22:31,607
I can't let my life end in
a place like this, dammit!

1201
01:22:31,822 --> 01:22:33,608
But, well, it was a pretty fun life.

1202
01:22:33,824 --> 01:22:36,566
Momma, thank you for
bringing me into this world.

1203
01:22:36,785 --> 01:22:41,119
Wait, I ain't dead yet!
What am I, a flashy idiot?!

1204
01:22:41,331 --> 01:22:44,789
Oh, yeah! I have my famous weapon!

1205
01:22:45,002 --> 01:22:48,494
Special attack! Muggy ball!

1206
01:22:57,848 --> 01:22:59,008
What?!

1207
01:23:03,645 --> 01:23:07,729
Cipher pol... the government's dogs!

1208
01:23:13,989 --> 01:23:17,072
How'd you like that taste
of my incredible power?!

1209
01:23:19,745 --> 01:23:25,365
The hell's going on?! He's the one
they said carried on Roger's strength!

1210
01:23:25,584 --> 01:23:28,701
Incredible... but I bet
it won't end this easily!

1211
01:23:28,921 --> 01:23:33,915
Yeah, but luffy will be okay.
Let's hurry back to the sunny.

1212
01:23:34,885 --> 01:23:37,297
Robin-chan! Sorry, but
go on ahead without me!

1213
01:23:37,513 --> 01:23:38,548
What?

1214
01:23:40,641 --> 01:23:43,724
You think you've cornered me like this?!

1215
01:23:45,479 --> 01:23:46,719
Crap! Run!

1216
01:23:46,939 --> 01:23:49,772
Even with one arm gone...

1217
01:23:52,611 --> 01:23:54,192
I'm ss o rry!

1218
01:23:56,281 --> 01:23:59,648
This is enough to kill you all!

1219
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:03,326
Dammit! It failed!

1220
01:24:03,539 --> 01:24:06,406
Not yet! Let's all attack him
ohne more time to trim him down!

1221
01:24:06,625 --> 01:24:08,661
So that luffy can finish him off!

1222
01:24:08,877 --> 01:24:10,287
Straw hat-ya?!

1223
01:24:10,504 --> 01:24:11,209
That brat...!

1224
01:24:11,421 --> 01:24:12,831
Luffy!

1225
01:24:16,385 --> 01:24:18,376
Follow straw hat-ya!

1226
01:24:18,595 --> 01:24:19,380
What's this?!

1227
01:24:19,596 --> 01:24:23,134
Bleh! That was close!
There's no way I'm stayin' for this!

1228
01:24:41,535 --> 01:24:45,369
Idiots! I'll just repel it, that's all!

1229
01:24:46,498 --> 01:24:47,783
Then how's this?!

1230
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,240
Huh?

1231
01:24:50,335 --> 01:24:53,793
I can't die in a place... like this!

1232
01:25:05,475 --> 01:25:08,763
How insolent!

1233
01:25:09,855 --> 01:25:14,724
I'll crush... everything!

1234
01:25:14,943 --> 01:25:16,183
The hell's going on?!

1235
01:25:16,403 --> 01:25:18,439
He can move in that state?!

1236
01:25:25,912 --> 01:25:29,075
Bullet!

1237
01:25:31,668 --> 01:25:33,750
This will...

1238
01:25:33,962 --> 01:25:35,418
Beat you for sure!

1239
01:25:38,342 --> 01:25:41,800
You're just a ragtag bunch of weaklings!

1240
01:25:44,431 --> 01:25:47,047
Don't get so carried away!

1241
01:25:47,267 --> 01:25:53,183
Gum-gum... king, king...

1242
01:25:53,398 --> 01:25:57,858
Ultimate... fist!

1243
01:25:58,070 --> 01:26:02,313
King Kong... gun!

1244
01:26:21,718 --> 01:26:23,049
What?!

1245
01:26:45,659 --> 01:26:47,490
Lil' brat!

1246
01:26:47,703 --> 01:26:49,864
Nice try!

1247
01:26:51,957 --> 01:26:52,571
Luffy!

1248
01:26:52,791 --> 01:26:53,826
Luffy-San!

1249
01:26:54,042 --> 01:26:58,376
If you had just a bit more strength...
You would have won!

1250
01:27:00,132 --> 01:27:02,623
Wha...?! What the hell?!

1251
01:27:09,641 --> 01:27:11,097
What's going on?!

1252
01:27:13,061 --> 01:27:17,270
My special... green star...
Snake fireworks...

1253
01:27:17,482 --> 01:27:20,394
They're set off by a strong impact.

1254
01:27:20,610 --> 01:27:24,899
Assisting friends... is
the role of the sniper.

1255
01:27:25,115 --> 01:27:28,653
Ahhhhh! Bullet!

1256
01:27:28,869 --> 01:27:34,239
Don't tell me my plans will be ruined
by a bunch of brats like them!

1257
01:27:35,542 --> 01:27:37,078
He's finally out!

1258
01:27:37,294 --> 01:27:38,955
I'll take that treasure.

1259
01:27:46,511 --> 01:27:47,717
Don't get in...

1260
01:27:47,929 --> 01:27:49,965
Our captain's way!

1261
01:27:51,725 --> 01:27:55,138
Straw hat!

1262
01:27:55,353 --> 01:27:58,095
Our duel starts now!

1263
01:27:59,024 --> 01:28:00,309
You got some guts!

1264
01:28:00,525 --> 01:28:05,110
Let's see who's stronger...
With a fistfight!

1265
01:28:05,322 --> 01:28:07,654
You're insanely strong!

1266
01:28:07,866 --> 01:28:12,075
But I'm gonna surpass you!

1267
01:28:13,497 --> 01:28:15,579
So that I can protect...

1268
01:28:17,417 --> 01:28:20,625
What's important!

1269
01:28:23,215 --> 01:28:24,705
Don't make me laugh!

1270
01:28:31,348 --> 01:28:34,340
This sea is a battlefield!

1271
01:28:34,559 --> 01:28:40,395
A firm determination to believe only
in yourself and to survive alone...

1272
01:28:44,945 --> 01:28:48,108
That is the true source of ultimate power!

1273
01:28:58,917 --> 01:29:03,581
I wield that power!
I am the world's strongest man!

1274
01:29:03,797 --> 01:29:05,503
I am...

1275
01:29:05,715 --> 01:29:07,831
The king of the pirates!

1276
01:29:08,051 --> 01:29:11,043
The king of the pirates
is nothing like that!

1277
01:29:11,263 --> 01:29:13,379
Gum-gum...

1278
01:29:13,598 --> 01:29:16,010
Go to hell, straw hat!

1279
01:29:16,226 --> 01:29:18,387
King Kong...

1280
01:29:18,603 --> 01:29:20,559
The strongest...

1281
01:29:20,772 --> 01:29:22,012
Gatling!

1282
01:29:22,232 --> 01:29:24,439
Strike!

1283
01:29:39,791 --> 01:29:43,454
I can continue to win in this sea,
because I'm alone!

1284
01:29:43,670 --> 01:29:47,709
The world's strongest... is me!

1285
01:29:53,305 --> 01:29:55,011
Shut up!

1286
01:29:55,223 --> 01:30:00,388
There isn't a single person
who lives in these seas alone!

1287
01:30:04,733 --> 01:30:06,473
So strong...

1288
01:30:07,485 --> 01:30:13,822
But someday, I swear I'll defeat you
and become the world's strongest man...

1289
01:30:14,034 --> 01:30:15,570
Roger!

1290
01:30:15,785 --> 01:30:22,202
You're strong. I'll take
you on anytime, bullet.

1291
01:30:44,814 --> 01:30:52,027
I'm the man... who's gonna be...
The king of the pirates!

1292
01:31:23,436 --> 01:31:25,301
Luffy!

1293
01:31:25,522 --> 01:31:27,604
Are you all right?!

1294
01:31:27,816 --> 01:31:29,681
I got the treasure!

1295
01:31:29,901 --> 01:31:30,901
What?

1296
01:31:32,529 --> 01:31:34,736
We win!

1297
01:31:46,835 --> 01:31:49,417
This can't be... happening...

1298
01:32:01,224 --> 01:32:03,431
Luffy... what is that?

1299
01:32:03,643 --> 01:32:07,977
It's the pirate king's treasure.
I don't know what's inside, though.

1300
01:32:08,189 --> 01:32:09,429
What's this?

1301
01:32:11,735 --> 01:32:13,646
An eternal pose to laugh tale!

1302
01:32:13,862 --> 01:32:14,862
To laugh tale?

1303
01:32:15,071 --> 01:32:17,608
That's right! If you have this...

1304
01:32:19,701 --> 01:32:20,315
Luffy?

1305
01:32:20,535 --> 01:32:23,368
Hand that over, straw hat!

1306
01:32:27,917 --> 01:32:31,876
What the hell... are you doin'?!

1307
01:32:33,006 --> 01:32:35,042
I don't...

1308
01:32:35,258 --> 01:32:36,873
Need this!

1309
01:32:42,140 --> 01:32:44,927
You're insane, straw hat-ya...

1310
01:32:46,102 --> 01:32:47,808
Luffy! Luffy-San!

1311
01:32:50,857 --> 01:32:53,269
The buster call can't be stopped now!

1312
01:32:53,485 --> 01:32:57,444
It's my parting gift to you! Burn to ashes!

1313
01:32:58,907 --> 01:33:02,274
We've been watching all this time.

1314
01:33:03,244 --> 01:33:08,614
Festival master...
No, the monstrous warmonger...

1315
01:33:08,833 --> 01:33:11,290
Buena festa.

1316
01:33:11,503 --> 01:33:14,916
The revolutionary army's no. 2...

1317
01:33:16,174 --> 01:33:20,338
I never imagined that those guys
would team up. Was that your idea?

1318
01:33:20,553 --> 01:33:27,391
It was no one's. Luffy just somehow
inspired us to band together.

1319
01:33:28,728 --> 01:33:29,968
Fire fist!

1320
01:33:38,488 --> 01:33:41,070
Straw hat luffy...

1321
01:33:41,282 --> 01:33:47,027
He draws enemies and allies together...
And turns it into strong power...

1322
01:33:47,247 --> 01:33:52,913
He's got the potential... to be the next
pirate king and start a new era...

1323
01:33:53,128 --> 01:33:58,122
I guess I teamed up with the wrong man.

1324
01:33:58,341 --> 01:34:02,584
Don't worry, he would
never team up with you.

1325
01:34:11,813 --> 01:34:14,850
Thanks to Robin's map, we figured
out an escape route, but...

1326
01:34:15,066 --> 01:34:16,397
With the buster call...

1327
01:34:16,609 --> 01:34:19,146
Our path will be blocked!

1328
01:34:27,036 --> 01:34:28,697
So many of 'em!

1329
01:34:28,913 --> 01:34:30,619
We're like rats in a trap!

1330
01:34:37,213 --> 01:34:39,454
I'm gonna sink that fleet!

1331
01:34:39,674 --> 01:34:43,758
All of you... stay outta my way!

1332
01:34:49,184 --> 01:34:50,344
Those guys...

1333
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:52,266
Franky! Let's go, too!

1334
01:34:52,478 --> 01:34:54,969
Let's go, sunny!

1335
01:35:01,863 --> 01:35:03,353
Hey, you.

1336
01:35:03,573 --> 01:35:05,234
Can you visualize this guy?

1337
01:35:05,450 --> 01:35:06,986
It's no use! We're getting blocked!

1338
01:35:07,202 --> 01:35:09,659
Bring it on... we'll bust through!

1339
01:35:14,959 --> 01:35:17,041
Hey...! No way!

1340
01:35:17,253 --> 01:35:19,835
Yasakani sacred Jewel.

1341
01:35:20,048 --> 01:35:21,879
Crap! It's kizaru!

1342
01:35:24,302 --> 01:35:26,042
Fire fist!

1343
01:35:29,390 --> 01:35:30,790
A message from vice admiral smoker!

1344
01:35:30,975 --> 01:35:31,555
Hmm?

1345
01:35:31,768 --> 01:35:35,135
â€œPirate king's treasure
destroyed by straw hat luffy!

1346
01:35:35,355 --> 01:35:37,516
Many marines still on island!

1347
01:35:37,732 --> 01:35:40,018
Request immediate stop of buster call!

1348
01:35:40,235 --> 01:35:43,727
Repeat! Request immediate
stop of buster call!"

1349
01:35:43,947 --> 01:35:45,107
A wall of flames?!

1350
01:35:45,323 --> 01:35:46,608
It's a path of fire!

1351
01:35:46,824 --> 01:35:49,907
We can escape now! Luffy!

1352
01:36:05,176 --> 01:36:07,883
See ya... luffy.

1353
01:36:08,096 --> 01:36:11,088
Now's our chance, guys! Let's go!

1354
01:36:11,307 --> 01:36:13,423
Yeah!

1355
01:39:29,672 --> 01:39:32,084
What kind of joke is this?!

1356
01:39:32,300 --> 01:39:34,336
You recorded it to an eternal pose?!

1357
01:39:34,552 --> 01:39:37,794
We did it just in case!
If we ever need it again...

1358
01:39:38,014 --> 01:39:43,475
"Just in case"? We won't.
Our journey's over now...

1359
01:39:43,686 --> 01:39:47,304
It's not the kind of treasure that
someone who'd rely on this can obtain.

1360
01:39:49,025 --> 01:39:53,359
Ahh! Captain! We can't go back now!

1361
01:39:55,698 --> 01:39:59,737
We were... too early...

1362
01:39:59,952 --> 01:40:04,070
The one piece, huh...?
Wonder who'll find it...

1363
01:40:04,290 --> 01:40:06,497
Why, my son, obviously!

1364
01:40:06,709 --> 01:40:07,949
You don't have one.

1365
01:40:08,169 --> 01:40:10,660
I'm gonna have one soon!

1366
01:40:14,884 --> 01:40:16,670
Whaaaat?!

1367
01:40:16,886 --> 01:40:20,595
You broke the eternal pose to laugh tale?!

1368
01:40:20,806 --> 01:40:21,806
Yeah.

1369
01:40:21,849 --> 01:40:24,431
What are you doing?! Are
you stupid or what?!

1370
01:40:24,644 --> 01:40:28,432
That could've been a
shortcut to the one piece!

1371
01:40:29,774 --> 01:40:33,392
Well, knowing you, I thought you'd do that!

1372
01:40:33,611 --> 01:40:35,852
That was our big chance...

1373
01:40:38,991 --> 01:40:42,483
There are lots more awesome
adventures out there waiting for us!

1374
01:40:42,703 --> 01:40:45,445
If we took a shortcut,
we'd miss out on them all!

1375
01:40:45,665 --> 01:40:51,752
All right, you guys! Let's set sail
for our next adventure!

1376
01:40:51,963 --> 01:40:54,249
Yeah!

1377
01:40:55,305 --> 01:41:55,294
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
