1
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:53,880
Can I persuade you to take a sandwich?

2
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,050
I'll get drive-through.

3
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:40,840
You're counting on the Winged Avenger
to deliver you from evil...

4
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,680
...aren't you, my friend?

5
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,890
Are you going to kill me?

6
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:49,640
Maybe, maybe not.
We're of two minds on the subject.

7
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,860
Are you a gambling man?

8
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,940
Let's say we flip for it?

9
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:01,110
One man is born a hero,
his brother a coward.

10
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,120
Babies starve, politicians grow fat...

11
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:08,370
...holy men are martyred,
and junkies grow legion.

12
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,330
Why?

13
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,080
Why, why, why, why, why?

14
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,420
Luck!

15
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,460
Blind, stupid, simple, doo-dah...

16
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,510
...clueless luck!

17
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,470
The random toss...

18
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,640
...is the only true justice.

19
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:32,480
Let's see what justice has in store...

20
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:34,980
...for you.

21
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,240
It's like the touch of God.

22
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:44,160
Wait, wait, wait.

23
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,660
Fortune smiles.
Another day of wine and roses.

24
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,710
In your case, beer and pizza.

25
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:53,790
Out of here, guys!

26
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,920
-But you said you'd let me live!
-Too true!

27
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:00,920
And so you shall! Nothing's better
than live bait to trap a bat.

28
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:17,690
Hot entrance.

29
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,440
Two-Face?

30
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:20,690
Two guards are dead.

31
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:23,200
He's holding a third hostage.
Didn't see this one coming.

32
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,700
We should have.

33
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,530
The Second Bank of Gotham--

34
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,870
Second anniversary
of the day I captured him.

35
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,450
How could he resist?

36
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,950
I'm Chase Meridian.

37
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,500
I asked her to come here to consult
on the case. She specializes in--

38
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:40,050
Abnormal psychology,
multiple personalities. I read your work.

39
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:41,260
Insightful.

40
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,970
Naive, but insightful.

41
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:46,890
I'm flattered. Not every girl
makes a superhero's night table.

42
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:48,470
Can we reason with him?

43
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:51,470
-He's got innocent people up there.
-It won't do any good.

44
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,270
-He'll slaughter them without a thought.
-Agreed.

45
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:57,940
A trauma powerful enough to create
an alternate personality leaves one--

46
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,980
In a world where normal rules
of right and wrong no longer apply.

47
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,070
Exactly.

48
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:03,320
Like you.

49
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,570
I could write a hell of a paper on a man
who dresses like a flying rodent.

50
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,370
Bats aren't rodents, Dr. Meridian.

51
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,160
Really? I didn't know that.

52
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,290
You are interesting.

53
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,500
And call me Chase.

54
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:27,180
By the way, do you have a first name,
or do I call you Bats?

55
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,430
Let's start this party with a bang!

56
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:47,490
Very punctual, even for his own funeral.
Boys!

57
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,570
Kill the Bat!

58
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:02,340
Blast him!

59
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,600
Open sesame.

60
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,080
It's a trap!

61
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,830
<i>Attention citizens of fair Gotham!</i>

62
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,710
<i>When we open that safe,
we'll have everything we ever wanted:</i>

63
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:11,300
<i>Enough cash to rain down upon
fair Gotham, a glorious flood of chaos.</i>

64
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,430
<i>And, of course...</i>

65
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,300
<i>...you, my boy, dead!</i>

66
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,980
It's boiling acid!

67
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:27,110
<i>For your dying pleasure, we are serving
the acid that made us the men we are!</i>

68
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,150
No!

69
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,280
-Hold on.
-Yes!

70
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,530
Haul away!

71
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:38,740
Yes! Haul away!

72
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,630
-Give me your hand.
-Don't let go!

73
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,010
I must borrow this.

74
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:59,300
That's my hearing aid!

75
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:00,640
Thanks.

76
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,940
Wow! My shoes are melting!

77
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:18,410
No more!

78
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:35,170
Hang on.

79
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,510
Hang on?

80
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,700
Get him down.

81
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,160
Get him down.

82
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,120
Take it easy with him.

83
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,710
You'll be all right. Just stay calm.

84
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,510
This'll fix him!

85
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,520
Hang on, Batty!

86
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,750
Let's see.

87
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,500
Yes!

88
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,880
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!
Oh, happy day!

89
00:10:58,130 --> 00:10:59,840
Farewell forever to that...

90
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:02,050
...pointy-eared night rat!

91
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,760
Face!

92
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,250
You need help. Give it up.

93
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:57,480
Have the good taste to die!

94
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,280
See you!

95
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:43,740
<i>Despite a valiant effort
last night by Batman...</i>

96
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:47,780
<i>...Harvey Two-Face is still at large
and extremely dangerous.</i>

97
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,280
<i>In other news today...</i>

98
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:52,620
<i>...billionaire Bruce Wayne extended
his profit-sharing program...</i>

99
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:57,630
<i>...to the employees of the successful
electronics branch of Wayne Enterprises.</i>

100
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,680
Mr. Wayne.

101
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:14,100
Your inspections are
a departmental highlight.

102
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:16,600
Oh, my God, it's him.

103
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:20,190
I am a winner. I am a winner.

104
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,820
I am a winner.

105
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,740
I am a winner.

106
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:28,410
Bioremediation. Alternative fuel.

107
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,660
Mr. Wayne, look at that time.

108
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:34,160
Perhaps we should get to R & D
as soon as possible.

109
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:36,710
Mister...?

110
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,250
Oh, Bruce Wayne.

111
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,920
No, that's my name. And you are?

112
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:44,550
Nygma.

113
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,720
Edward.

114
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,390
Edward Nygma. You hired me personally.

115
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,850
Just like I tell everyone.

116
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:55,850
We've never actually met, but your name
was on the hiring slip. I have it.

117
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,690
I need that hand back.

118
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:01,400
Oh, yes, of course.

119
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:03,070
I'm sorry.

120
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,900
It's just that...

121
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:07,700
...you're my idol.

122
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:08,820
Back to work.

123
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:11,870
And some people have been trying
to keep us apart.

124
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,120
Back to work.

125
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:15,500
It's okay.

126
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,620
What's on your mind?

127
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,120
Precisely.

128
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,210
What's on all our minds?

129
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,210
Brain waves.

130
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,130
The future...

131
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,390
...of Wayne Enterprises...

132
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:34,100
...is brain waves.

133
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,640
I must apologize, Mr. Wayne.

134
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:40,810
-I terminated his project today.
-It's okay.

135
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,230
I have it!

136
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,410
My invention...

137
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:57,080
...beams any TV signal directly
into the human brain.

138
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:01,250
By stimulating neurons,
manipulating brain waves...

139
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:06,170
...this device makes the audience
feel like they're inside the show.

140
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:10,260
Why be brutalized by an uncaring world?

141
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:13,220
Did you say "manipulating brain waves"?

142
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,680
Yes.

143
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,730
But...

144
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,980
...someone like you would never need it.

145
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,190
Someone so...

146
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:27,690
...intelligent, witty and...

147
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:30,280
...charming.

148
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:35,410
I need a bit of additional funding
for human trials. Let me show you, please!

149
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:36,700
Now, listen...

150
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:39,870
...I want a full set of technical schematics
on this, okay?

151
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,460
We'll be full partners in this, Bruce.

152
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,790
Look at us! Two of a kind!

153
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:48,920
You call my assistant, Margaret.
She'll set something up.

154
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:51,130
That's not...

155
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,390
...going to be good for me.

156
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,970
I need an answer now.

157
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:58,640
I think I deserve it.

158
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,560
I'm sorry, then the answer is no.

159
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:05,060
Tampering with people's brain waves...

160
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,820
...mind manipulation...

161
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:10,150
...it just raises too many questions.

162
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:11,820
Sorry.

163
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,370
Thanks, keep up the good work.
The factory looks great.

164
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:16,830
All right, everyone!

165
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,240
Back to work!

166
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:20,450
We'll discuss this later!

167
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,340
You were supposed to understand.

168
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,760
I'll make you understand.

169
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,850
Lock.

170
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:47,480
Chair.

171
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,740
<i>I saw the signal.</i>

172
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,080
<i>All is ready.</i>

173
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:41,910
Commissioner?

174
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:43,250
He's at home.

175
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,580
I sent the signal.

176
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,000
What's wrong?

177
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,170
Last night at the bank I noticed
something about Two-Face:

178
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,340
His coin.

179
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:58,590
It's his Achilles' heel.

180
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,260
It can be exploited.

181
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:01,560
I know.

182
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,680
You called me for this?

183
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:05,770
The Batsignal is not a beeper.

184
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,360
I wish I could say that my interest
in you was...

185
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,270
...purely professional.

186
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,690
Are you trying to get under my cape?

187
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:16,740
A girl can't live by psychoses alone.

188
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:19,570
It's the car, right? Chicks love it.

189
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:23,450
What is it about the wrong kind of man?

190
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,370
In grade school: guys with earrings.

191
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:29,290
College: motorcycles, leather jackets.

192
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:31,460
Now...

193
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:36,670
...black rubber.

194
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:39,720
Try a fireman. Less to take off.

195
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:45,600
I don't mind the work.
Pity I can't see behind the mask.

196
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,480
We all wear masks.

197
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,190
My life's an open book. You read?

198
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:53,730
I don't blend in at a family picnic.

199
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:57,860
We could give it a try. I'll bring the wine...

200
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:01,240
...you bring your scarred psyche.

201
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,040
Direct, aren't you?

202
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,540
You like strong women.

203
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,410
I've done my homework.

204
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:11,500
Or do I need skintight vinyl and a whip?

205
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:15,000
I haven't had much luck with women.

206
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:18,130
Maybe you just haven't met
the right woman.

207
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,560
I saw the signal.

208
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,520
-What's going on?
-Nothing.

209
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:29,940
False alarm.

210
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:32,150
Are you sure?

211
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,120
Women.

212
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,890
Now I've got it!

213
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,980
"Too many questions.
There's too many questions.

214
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,600
"Too many...."

215
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,650
I'll show you it works!

216
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:17,190
What the hell is going on here?

217
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:21,490
I told you this project is terminated!
I'm calling Security!

218
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,750
Caffeine will kill you!

219
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:36,750
Rise and shine, little guinea pig.

220
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,420
What are you doing?

221
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:39,670
Untie me!

222
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,220
This won't hurt.

223
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:43,680
At least, I don't think it will.

224
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:46,470
What are you doing?

225
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,350
You touch that switch and--

226
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:50,390
This?

227
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,660
Losing resolution.

228
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,450
More power!

229
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,600
Edward Nygma...

230
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:35,850
...come on down!

231
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:38,020
You're the next contestant on...

232
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:39,690
<i>...Brain Drain!</i>

233
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:45,280
I'll take what's inside
thick skull number one!

234
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:47,490
What have we got for him?

235
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:50,950
Oh, Stickley, I'm having a breakthrough!

236
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:53,660
And a breakdown? Maybe!

237
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:56,710
Nevertheless, I'm smarter. I'm a genius.

238
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,880
No, several geniuses.

239
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:01,090
A gaggle, a swarm...

240
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,840
...a flock of freaking Freuds!

241
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:07,130
Riddle me this, Fred.

242
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:09,850
What is everything to someone...

243
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:12,100
...and nothing to everyone else?

244
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,270
Your mind, baby!

245
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,310
Now mine pumps with the power of yours!

246
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,690
"I'm sucking up your IQ

247
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:22,900
"Vacuuming your cortex

248
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:24,860
"Feeding off your brain"

249
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:52,390
What a rush!

250
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:56,270
What the hell just happened?

251
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:01,060
A very surprising side effect.

252
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:04,820
While you were mesmerized
by my 3-D TV...

253
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:08,780
...I utilized your neural energy
to grow smarter.

254
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,820
Bruce Wayne was right!

255
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:14,370
You demented, bizarre, unethical toad!

256
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,080
It is brain manipulation!

257
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:19,580
I'm reporting you to the FCC!

258
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:22,380
The human experimentation board!
The AMI!

259
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:23,840
And the police!

260
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,920
You are going up on charges...

261
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:27,760
...to court, to jail...

262
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:31,050
...and then to a mental institution
for the rest of your life!

263
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:34,140
But, first and foremost,
Nygma, you are fired!

264
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,310
Do you hear me? Fired!

265
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,810
I don't think so.

266
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:58,830
Help!

267
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:04,460
Hang on!

268
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:10,340
Babe!

269
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,340
You are fired!

270
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:14,510
Or should I say...

271
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:16,680
...terminated?

272
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,940
Surf's up, Big Kahuna!

273
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,650
Nice form, but rough on the landing.

274
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:33,530
He may have to settle for the Bronze.

275
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:40,250
"Questions," Mr. Wayne?

276
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:44,080
My work raises too many questions?

277
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:47,040
<i>Why hasn't anybody...</i>

278
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,920
<i>...put you in your place?</i>

279
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,340
<i>Harvey Dent,
once Gotham's District Attorney...</i>

280
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:59,060
<i>...was horribly scarred
by underworld kingpin, Boss Moroni.</i>

281
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:01,520
<i>Although Batman tried to save him...</i>

282
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:05,810
<i>...Dent's left-brain damage
turned him into a violent criminal...</i>

283
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:09,320
<i>...who blamed Batman
and who has vowed to destroy him.</i>

284
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:13,110
<i>Harvey Two-Face is extremely dangerous,
repeat, extremely dangerous.</i>

285
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,030
That was the Commissioner.

286
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,330
There's been an accident
at Wayne Enterprises.

287
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:21,450
Horrible way to die.

288
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,870
The surveillance cameras are down here.

289
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:28,170
We'll dredge the river, but with
that current, I doubt we'll find the body.

290
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:32,840
Why?

291
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:34,380
Oh, why?

292
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:39,220
I just can't believe it.

293
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:42,220
Two years working in the same office.

294
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,980
He was like my father...

295
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,480
...my brother...

296
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:49,060
...or a cousin that visits a lot.

297
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,230
Get a grip, Edward.

298
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,200
I found this in my cubicle.

299
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:59,740
You'll find the handwriting matches his,
as does the sentence structure.

300
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:06,250
I couldn't possibly continue on here.

301
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,210
The memories....

302
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:13,760
This is last night's security log.

303
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:15,760
There's Stickley.

304
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:23,470
Pretty cut and dry.

305
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,520
Yes, definitely suicide.

306
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:36,110
Thanks very much for your help, Bruce.
We'll be in touch.

307
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:44,330
Stickley's suicide doesn't make sense.
I want full benefits for his family.

308
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:47,210
Suicide's not covered
by our corporate insurance policy.

309
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:48,960
I know. Full benefits.

310
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:53,130
Gossip Gerty called 32 times.
Who are you taking to the Charity Circus?

311
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,380
I'll let you know. What's this?

312
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:57,380
I don't know.

313
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:59,300
I didn't see anyone.

314
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,480
"If you look at the numbers on my face...

315
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:13,980
"...you won't find 13 anyplace."

316
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,780
That's hideous.

317
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:17,530
What does it mean?

318
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,070
It's a riddle.

319
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:21,280
"Numbers on my face...13."

320
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,700
One through twelve.

321
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:25,490
The answer is a clock.

322
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,830
Who would send you a riddle?

323
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:29,670
That, Maggie...

324
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:31,380
...is the riddle.

325
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:17,380
Guess what I did today?

326
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,080
Wayne Manor.

327
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,540
See you soon.

328
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:31,080
Dr. Meridian, please. Thank you.

329
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,900
I...guess I'm early.

330
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:07,610
I have an appointment.

331
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,240
I'm Bruce Wayne.

332
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:10,990
Good.

333
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,790
Then you can afford to buy me a new door.

334
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:15,710
I'm sorry.

335
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:22,210
You...sounded like you were in...

336
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,050
...you know, trouble.

337
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:34,060
I prefer healthy expressions of violence
as opposed to breaking in.

338
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:36,480
So...

339
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:38,770
...how can I help you?

340
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:44,440
Someone's been sending me love letters.

341
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:47,400
One at my office and one at my home.

342
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:52,870
Commissioner Gordon thought
you might give me your opinion.

343
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,330
A clock.

344
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,500
Clock.

345
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,340
"Tear one off and scratch my head.

346
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,550
"What once was red is black instead."

347
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:14,180
A match.

348
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:21,900
My opinion: this letter writer is a wacko.

349
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,520
"Wacko?"

350
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:25,860
Is that a technical term?

351
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,990
Patient may suffer from obsession...

352
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,200
...with potential homicidal tendencies.
Is that better for you?

353
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:35,290
So, what you're saying is...

354
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:37,290
...this guy's a total wacko.

355
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:38,660
Exactly.

356
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:42,130
He's obsessed with you.

357
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:45,210
His only escape may be
to purge the fixation.

358
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,050
To kill me.

359
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,930
I think you understand obsession
better than you let on.

360
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:56,720
You like bats?

361
00:31:57,850 --> 00:31:59,810
That's a Rorschach, Mr. Wayne.

362
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,350
An inkblot.

363
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,230
People see what they want.

364
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,860
The question is: do you like bats?

365
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,450
Still playing with dolls?

366
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:15,080
She's a Malaysian dream warden.

367
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:18,580
Some cultures believe she protects you
from bad dreams.

368
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:21,500
It's silly to you, I'm sure.

369
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,880
You look so sad.

370
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,760
Do you need one?

371
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:33,470
Me? No. Why would I?

372
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:38,810
You're not exactly what you seem,
are you?

373
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:42,440
What is it you really came here for?

374
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:46,440
Yikes, time's up.

375
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:50,320
That's usually my line.

376
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:52,570
I'd love to stay here chatting--

377
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,030
Would you?

378
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:56,240
I'm not so sure.

379
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:59,500
I must get you out of those clothes.

380
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,830
Excuse me?

381
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,920
And into a black dress.

382
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,790
Tell me, Doctor, do you like the circus?

383
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,400
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

384
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:30,820
<i>...boys and girls of all ages...</i>

385
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:33,650
<i>...welcome to the greatest show on earth!</i>

386
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:36,660
Who is this beautiful young woman
you're with?

387
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,240
Dr. Chase Meridian.

388
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:39,410
A doctor?

389
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:41,250
What kind of doctor?

390
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:43,580
<i>...for Gotham Children's Hospital.</i>

391
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:46,380
<i>Let's thank our largest single donor:</i>

392
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:48,750
<i>Bruce Wayne!</i>

393
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:52,970
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

394
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:55,760
<i>...70 feet above the ground...</i>

395
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:59,350
<i>...performing feats
of unimaginable aerial skill...</i>

396
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:01,970
<i>...the Flying Graysons!</i>

397
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,400
Listen...

398
00:34:57,490 --> 00:35:01,280
...I'm going rock climbing this weekend.
Would you like to join me?

399
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:03,790
I'd like to.

400
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,830
I love climbing. I really love it.

401
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:08,120
But?

402
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,330
I've met someone.

403
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:14,050
That's fast work. You just moved here.

404
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:15,920
You could say he just...

405
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:18,470
...dropped out of the sky and...

406
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:20,010
...bang!

407
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,310
I think he felt it too.

408
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:24,640
He sure did.

409
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:25,770
What?

410
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,850
Who wouldn't?

411
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:31,270
<i>Now...</i>

412
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,070
<i>...Richard...</i>

413
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:36,650
<i>...the youngest Flying Grayson...</i>

414
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,700
<i>...will perform the awe-inspiring...</i>

415
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,160
<i>...death drop...</i>

416
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:44,580
<i>...without the safety...</i>

417
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:45,870
<i>...of a net!</i>

418
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:06,270
Let's go.

419
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,890
You'll be okay.

420
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:44,220
<i>Ladies...</i>

421
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:46,060
<i>...and gentlemen!</i>

422
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:50,890
<i>Now, the new management
of the circus invites you to forget...</i>

423
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:53,400
<i>...this good, wholesome fun...</i>

424
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,320
<i>...and join us in a celebration
of absolute chaos...</i>

425
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,190
<i>...and true jesters!</i>

426
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:00,570
<i>Bring it on!</i>

427
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:02,110
<i>Now!</i>

428
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:16,040
<i>Tonight, a new act for your...</i>

429
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:20,130
<i>...personal amazement.
We call it, "Massacre under the Big Top. "</i>

430
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,430
<i>Let us direct your attention to the ring.</i>

431
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,600
<i>Inside this harmless-looking orb are two...</i>

432
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:31,890
<i>...that's two hundred sticks of TNT.</i>

433
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:35,230
<i>And in our innocent hand...</i>

434
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,310
<i>...a radio detonator.</i>

435
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:39,780
What do you want?

436
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:41,570
<i>Want, Mr. Mayor?</i>

437
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:43,650
<i>One simple thing: Batman.</i>

438
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:45,780
<i>Bruised, broken, bleeding...</i>

439
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:47,660
<i>...in a word: dead!</i>

440
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,410
Batman.

441
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:55,620
<i>Who do we have before us?</i>

442
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,380
<i>Gotham's finest...</i>

443
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:58,880
<i>...well-to-do...</i>

444
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,090
<i>...influential.</i>

445
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:02,550
<i>Surely one of you knows who Batman is.</i>

446
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:06,220
<i>Hell, odds are one of you pasty-faced twits
is Batman!</i>

447
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,140
<i>You have two minutes.</i>

448
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:16,980
Harvey!

449
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:19,150
I'm Batman!

450
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:39,540
We can stop them.

451
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:40,920
Go out on the rigging.

452
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:41,750
Be careful.

453
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,050
Don't worry.

454
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,690
Go to work, boys!

455
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:26,340
Our kind of day.

456
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:37,270
Reach for it! Stop it!

457
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,480
Oh, my God.

458
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:28,300
It's good you took him in.
He hasn't anyone now.

459
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:32,090
He's filled out papers all day.
He hasn't slept or eaten.

460
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:45,690
Welcome, Master Grayson.

461
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:46,940
I'm Alfred.

462
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,980
How're you doing, Al?

463
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:54,820
There's a room prepared for you.
But perhaps you'd like to eat first.

464
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:59,080
Okay, I'm out of here.

465
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,080
Excuse me?

466
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,420
Telling that cop I'd stay here...

467
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:07,790
...saved me a lot
of social-service interviews.

468
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:10,670
So, no offense, but no thanks. See you.

469
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,420
Take it easy.

470
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:27,860
Where will you go? The circus
must be halfway to Metropolis.

471
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:29,650
Get a fix on Two-Face.

472
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:31,320
Then I'll kill him.

473
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:34,490
Killing Two-Face won't take the pain away.

474
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,240
It'll make it worse.

475
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,370
Spare me the sermons, all right?

476
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:41,700
I don't need your advice or your charity.

477
00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:44,660
Nice bike.

478
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:47,290
Hang out at a lot of biker bars?

479
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,840
You're almost on empty.

480
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,380
Fill it up in the garage.
There's no gas station for miles.

481
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:04,810
The pump's over here.

482
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:07,520
Is this a garage or a car museum, Bruce?

483
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:18,280
That's a 1917 Harley.

484
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:19,240
Yep.

485
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:22,120
Indian Classic, fully restored.

486
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:24,950
This is a Vincent Black Knight.

487
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:27,160
They only made a hundred.

488
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:30,040
A hundred and one, actually.
She's my favorite.

489
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:31,920
You've got two.

490
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:33,670
That one doesn't run.

491
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:36,510
The throttle sticks on this one.

492
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,090
Alfred's a good mechanic, but...

493
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:41,510
...these need a lot of work.

494
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:43,850
If someone were to fix them up...

495
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:45,640
...they could keep one.

496
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:48,730
Anyway...

497
00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:50,440
...have a nice trip.

498
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:52,860
You'll land on your feet.

499
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,530
Is the young master leaving?

500
00:43:58,780 --> 00:43:59,950
Pity.

501
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:03,950
I'll just toss this away then.
Perhaps the dogs are hungry.

502
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:09,250
Hey, Al, wait up.

503
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:04,360
Master Bruce?

504
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:11,540
Just like my parents.

505
00:46:12,290 --> 00:46:14,040
It's happening again.

506
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:18,540
A monster comes out of the night,
a scream, two shots.

507
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:21,880
I killed them.

508
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:23,970
What did you say?

509
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:25,470
He killed them.

510
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:26,760
Two-Face.

511
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:29,300
He slaughtered that boy's parents.

512
00:46:29,470 --> 00:46:30,720
No, no.

513
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:33,310
You said, "I killed them."

514
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:47,410
Take care of the kid.

515
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:49,070
Certainly, sir.

516
00:46:57,210 --> 00:47:00,090
Can I help you settle in, Master Grayson?

517
00:47:00,590 --> 00:47:01,500
No.

518
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,090
Thanks, I won't be staying long.

519
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:08,930
Is this a robin?

520
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:15,810
My brother's wire broke once
and I swung out and grabbed him.

521
00:47:17,270 --> 00:47:19,360
My father said I was his hero.

522
00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:22,820
I flew in like a robin.

523
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:27,530
Some hero I turned out to be.

524
00:47:28,450 --> 00:47:30,570
But your father was right.

525
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:33,040
You are a hero. I can tell.

526
00:47:40,210 --> 00:47:43,550
Throw this away, will you?
I won't need it anymore.

527
00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:48,680
I think I'll just put it in here.

528
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:57,270
Broken wings mend in time.

529
00:47:58,850 --> 00:48:01,150
One day Robin will fly again.

530
00:48:01,650 --> 00:48:02,860
I promise.

531
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:26,770
We'll drive.

532
00:51:00,370 --> 00:51:01,580
The Puzzler?

533
00:51:06,290 --> 00:51:07,540
The Gamester?

534
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:16,130
Captain Kill?

535
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:22,010
Question Mark Man?

536
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:42,580
Thank you. Thank you so much.

537
00:51:56,510 --> 00:51:59,300
The Bat's stubborn refusal to expire...

538
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:02,890
...is driving us insane!

539
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:07,940
Don't worry, baby.

540
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,400
You'll kill him soon.

541
00:52:16,190 --> 00:52:17,570
Besides...

542
00:52:17,950 --> 00:52:19,860
...I made your favorite:

543
00:52:19,990 --> 00:52:21,990
Sparkling champagne and...

544
00:52:22,530 --> 00:52:26,040
...yummy poached salmon
with little quail eggs and...

545
00:52:26,950 --> 00:52:28,410
...a creamy...

546
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:29,750
...dreamy...

547
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:31,790
...lemon soufflé.

548
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:34,460
No, I made your favorite:

549
00:52:34,630 --> 00:52:37,050
A charred heart of black boar...

550
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:39,840
...a side of raw donkey meat...

551
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:44,720
...and a Sterno and grain alcohol,
straight up, baby!

552
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:47,390
Perfect!

553
00:52:47,810 --> 00:52:49,390
Ladies, you spoil us!

554
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:52,520
We're of two minds about what to eat first.

555
00:52:53,610 --> 00:52:54,520
What?

556
00:52:54,610 --> 00:52:56,230
I hope you made extra.

557
00:52:56,610 --> 00:52:58,240
Who the hell are you?

558
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:00,820
Just a friend.

559
00:53:01,110 --> 00:53:02,780
But you can call me...

560
00:53:03,450 --> 00:53:05,030
...The Riddler.

561
00:53:07,410 --> 00:53:11,290
I'll call you dead, is more like it!
How did you find us? Talk!

562
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:15,960
But then if I talked, what would keep you
from slaying me, O Segregated One?

563
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:19,630
That's never going to heal
if you don't stop picking.

564
00:53:21,130 --> 00:53:23,430
Let's see if you bleed green.

565
00:53:24,930 --> 00:53:26,970
It's not me you want to kill.

566
00:53:27,930 --> 00:53:31,730
That's just too easy for someone
as powerful as you and...

567
00:53:32,270 --> 00:53:33,310
...you.

568
00:53:34,150 --> 00:53:35,400
But Batman...

569
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:38,980
...there's a challenge.

570
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:41,820
Kill the Bat! Sounds like a good idea.

571
00:53:42,450 --> 00:53:47,330
But have you thought it through? A few
bullets, a splash of blood, then what?

572
00:53:48,290 --> 00:53:49,660
Wet hands.

573
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:52,790
Post-homicidal depression.

574
00:53:57,090 --> 00:53:58,960
Why not humiliate him first?

575
00:53:59,090 --> 00:53:59,880
Yeah.

576
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:03,510
Expose his frailties. Then, when he is
at his weakest...

577
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:05,300
...crush him!

578
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,180
I see that...

579
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:11,770
...sparkle in your left eye.

580
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:15,100
I can help you get Batman.

581
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:19,860
That is, if you'II...

582
00:54:20,110 --> 00:54:22,820
...spare my life for just a few moments.

583
00:54:34,330 --> 00:54:35,670
Thank you.

584
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:40,880
<i>I love what you've done with this place.
Heavy Metal meets House and Garden.</i>

585
00:54:42,670 --> 00:54:44,010
Beautiful.

586
00:54:44,130 --> 00:54:46,390
It's so dark and Gothic and...

587
00:54:46,890 --> 00:54:48,970
...disgustingly decadent.

588
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:53,140
Yet so bright and chipper and...

589
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:56,560
...conservative.

590
00:55:00,570 --> 00:55:02,030
It's so you!

591
00:55:03,030 --> 00:55:04,700
And yet, so you!

592
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:10,830
Very few people are both a summer
and a winter, but...

593
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:14,040
...but you pull it off nicely.

594
00:55:16,370 --> 00:55:18,080
What's the point?

595
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:23,510
Has anyone ever told you, you have
a serious impulse-control problem?

596
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:27,010
This is the point.

597
00:55:39,730 --> 00:55:41,770
This is how I found you.

598
00:55:42,190 --> 00:55:43,940
Let me demonstrate.

599
00:55:49,950 --> 00:55:52,240
This is your brain on The Box.

600
00:55:52,450 --> 00:55:54,370
This is my brain on The Box.

601
00:55:54,450 --> 00:55:56,870
Does anyone else feel like a fried egg?

602
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,210
I'll have more.

603
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:02,040
There's more. But only the first one's free.

604
00:56:03,130 --> 00:56:04,760
Here's the bargain:

605
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:07,630
You'll help me steal production capital...

606
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:10,590
...so I can put a Box on every TV in town...

607
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:14,430
...and become Gotham's cleverest,
carbon-based life form!

608
00:56:15,810 --> 00:56:17,480
And in return....

609
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,770
Is everybody paying attention?

610
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:24,860
I will help you solve the greatest riddle
of all.

611
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:27,070
The mother of all riddles:

612
00:56:28,610 --> 00:56:29,950
Who is...

613
00:56:30,450 --> 00:56:31,820
...Batman?

614
00:56:33,830 --> 00:56:36,000
You broke into our hideout.

615
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:38,790
You violated the sanctity of our lair.

616
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:41,670
We should crush your bones into powder.

617
00:56:41,790 --> 00:56:44,090
But you pose an interesting proposition.

618
00:56:44,170 --> 00:56:48,470
Therefore, heads: we accept,
and tails: we blow your damn head off.

619
00:57:03,980 --> 00:57:05,440
Here's a good one.

620
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:06,940
No, no, no!

621
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:09,650
There is a good one.

622
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:15,200
-Leave that. I'll attend to it.
-I'm not used to being waited on.

623
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:41,890
Don't shoot me!

624
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:44,480
Don't eyeball me! Give me that!

625
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:50,360
Two-Face, show me how to punch a guy!

626
00:57:50,570 --> 00:57:53,820
It's dead simple, my boy.
Ball up your fist, reach back...

627
00:57:53,910 --> 00:57:55,620
...and assert yourself.

628
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,500
That looks fun. Let me try.

629
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:03,540
Ball up the fist, reach way back...
assert yourself.

630
00:58:08,550 --> 00:58:11,630
One hundred thousand,
two hundred and twenty.

631
00:58:12,050 --> 00:58:13,550
One hundred and....

632
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:15,220
I lost count!

633
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:21,520
<i>Last night another robbery,
perpetrated by the Green-Suited Menace...</i>

634
00:58:21,730 --> 00:58:25,310
<i>...resulting in millions in diamonds stolen,
with no sign of Batman.</i>

635
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:28,230
<i>Teamed with Two-Face,
this new criminal's pattern...</i>

636
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:32,650
<i>...of marking his crimes with puzzles
has Gothamites calling him The Riddler.</i>

637
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:36,450
Apparently, you and Batman
have a common enemy.

638
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:39,120
That was with the morning mail.

639
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:43,160
"The eight of us go forth, not back.

640
00:58:43,250 --> 00:58:45,870
"To protect our king from the foe's attack."

641
00:58:47,250 --> 00:58:48,210
Chess pawns.

642
00:58:48,290 --> 00:58:49,380
Clock.

643
00:58:49,590 --> 00:58:50,300
Matches.

644
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:52,210
All physical, man-made objects.

645
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:54,430
Small in size, light in weight.

646
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:56,090
What's the connection?

647
00:58:56,180 --> 00:58:59,890
With all due respect,
that's why they call him The Riddler.

648
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:04,140
May I help you?

649
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:06,810
Why is this the only locked door?

650
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:09,060
What's back there?

651
00:59:09,230 --> 00:59:11,360
Master Wayne's dead wives.

652
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:14,740
The silver closet. On your way.

653
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:20,910
<i>Now, you can be part of the action!</i>

654
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,960
<i>Nygma Tech brings the joy
of 3-D entertainment into your home!</i>

655
00:59:27,250 --> 00:59:30,090
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you...</i>

656
00:59:30,750 --> 00:59:32,250
<i>...my vision.</i>

657
00:59:33,590 --> 00:59:36,180
<i>The Box in every home in America...</i>

658
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:38,470
<i>...and one day, the world!</i>

659
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:41,930
<i>In local news, Edward Nygma's 3-D Box...</i>

660
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:44,480
<i>...has become the rage of Gotham.</i>

661
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:48,770
<i>Rioting occurred last night

<i>There is hardly a home

663
00:59:53,650 --> 00:59:56,740
<i>Critics claim The Box turns Gothamites
into zombies.</i>

664
00:59:56,950 --> 00:59:58,660
<i>But Edward Nygma just shrugs.</i>

665
00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:01,740
<i>"That's what they said
when TV was invented. "</i>

666
01:00:44,910 --> 01:00:46,160
Master Dick!

667
01:00:47,660 --> 01:00:48,830
Up here.

668
01:00:49,830 --> 01:00:51,920
Just checking, young sir.

669
01:01:21,030 --> 01:01:23,450
<i>Intruder alert. Intruder alert.</i>

670
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:54,610
I have something for you. It's on the table.

671
01:01:55,150 --> 01:01:56,730
I hope you like it.

672
01:02:07,530 --> 01:02:09,700
Call it clinical intuition.

673
01:02:10,580 --> 01:02:13,040
I thought your dreams needed changing.

674
01:02:16,210 --> 01:02:18,590
My parents were murdered before me...

675
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:20,460
...when I was a kid.

676
01:02:23,470 --> 01:02:24,800
I don't...

677
01:02:25,340 --> 01:02:28,260
...remember a lot of what happened, but...

678
01:02:29,810 --> 01:02:32,980
...what I do comes to me in my dreams.
Flashes.

679
01:02:34,140 --> 01:02:37,610
There's a new element now, though,
I haven't seen before.

680
01:02:37,940 --> 01:02:39,980
It's a red leather book.

681
01:02:41,490 --> 01:02:43,240
Something else....

682
01:02:43,490 --> 01:02:46,280
My dreams come to me
when I'm awake now.

683
01:02:47,620 --> 01:02:50,620
Bruce, you're describing
repressed memories.

684
01:02:51,410 --> 01:02:54,870
Images of a forgotten pain
that's trying to surface.

685
01:02:57,960 --> 01:02:59,750
I'll be right back.

686
01:03:19,940 --> 01:03:24,110
Is it possible there's an aspect
of your parents' death you haven't faced?

687
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:26,610
You were so young when it happened.

688
01:03:28,030 --> 01:03:30,240
Maybe I should leave you two alone.

689
01:03:31,620 --> 01:03:35,210
This goes way beyond taking
your work home, doesn't it?

690
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:39,590
All right.

691
01:03:41,630 --> 01:03:43,550
I think he's fascinating.

692
01:03:44,210 --> 01:03:45,470
Clinically.

693
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:47,680
Why does a man do this?

694
01:03:48,890 --> 01:03:51,390
It's as if he's cursed to pay a penance.

695
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:55,680
What crime could he have committed
to deserve a life of nightly torture?

696
01:03:56,890 --> 01:03:58,560
It's more than just...

697
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:02,270
...professional interest, isn't it, Chase?

698
01:04:03,230 --> 01:04:04,940
Bruce, are you jealous?

699
01:04:05,690 --> 01:04:06,780
No.

700
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:10,070
I can't be jealous of Batman.

701
01:04:11,450 --> 01:04:14,450
I want to be close,
but you won't let me near.

702
01:04:16,290 --> 01:04:18,370
What are you protecting me from?

703
01:04:19,750 --> 01:04:21,460
Do you want to know me?

704
01:04:22,290 --> 01:04:24,250
Do you want to know who I am?

705
01:04:26,170 --> 01:04:27,420
I guess...

706
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:30,180
...we're all two people.

707
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:34,640
The one in daylight,
and the one we keep in shadow.

708
01:04:35,930 --> 01:04:37,180
Rage...

709
01:04:37,430 --> 01:04:38,810
...violence...

710
01:04:40,020 --> 01:04:41,190
...passion.

711
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:46,650
Excuse me.

712
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:49,490
I'm busy.

713
01:04:49,660 --> 01:04:53,830
<i>I'm sorry to bother you.
I have some distressing news about Dick.</i>

714
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:55,370
Is he okay?

715
01:04:55,450 --> 01:04:58,370
<i>I'm afraid Master Dick has gone traveling.</i>

716
01:04:59,420 --> 01:05:00,670
He ran away?

717
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:03,090
<i>Actually, he took the car.</i>

718
01:05:04,340 --> 01:05:05,840
He boosted the Jag?

719
01:05:06,210 --> 01:05:07,460
<i>Not the Jaguar.</i>

720
01:05:07,630 --> 01:05:09,010
<i>The other car.</i>

721
01:05:09,220 --> 01:05:10,220
The Bentley?

722
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:11,470
<i>No, sir.</i>

723
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:13,180
<i>The other car.</i>

724
01:05:44,790 --> 01:05:47,710
Come for a little ride
in my love machine, babies?

725
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:54,720
It's Batman!

726
01:05:54,850 --> 01:05:56,510
Open up, Batman.

727
01:05:58,270 --> 01:05:59,180
Wait!

728
01:05:59,350 --> 01:06:00,810
That's not Batman!

729
01:06:00,890 --> 01:06:02,270
What do you mean?

730
01:06:02,350 --> 01:06:03,900
That's Batboy!

731
01:06:04,730 --> 01:06:06,230
It ain't the Bat!

732
01:06:29,510 --> 01:06:30,920
Let her go!

733
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:40,350
Who the hell are you?

734
01:06:40,850 --> 01:06:42,060
I'm Batman.

735
01:06:44,310 --> 01:06:46,560
I forgot my suit, all right?

736
01:07:26,770 --> 01:07:28,270
Come on, run!

737
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:30,860
Doesn't Batman ever kiss the girl?

738
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:34,030
Go!

739
01:07:34,110 --> 01:07:35,860
Thanks, you saved my life!

740
01:07:36,110 --> 01:07:39,120
I could definitely get
into this superhero gig.

741
01:08:03,270 --> 01:08:04,520
Batman!

742
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:19,570
Bastard!

743
01:08:19,950 --> 01:08:21,660
It should've been you!

744
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:25,450
If you had told Two-Face who you were
at the circus...

745
01:08:25,660 --> 01:08:27,670
...they'd still be alive!

746
01:08:30,790 --> 01:08:34,840
If Bruce Wayne could've given his life
for your family, he would have.

747
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:43,930
All I can think about every day
is getting Two-Face.

748
01:08:45,180 --> 01:08:47,020
He took my whole life.

749
01:08:49,310 --> 01:08:51,230
When I was out there tonight...

750
01:08:51,310 --> 01:08:53,570
...I imagined it was him I was fighting...

751
01:08:53,650 --> 01:08:55,820
...even when I was fighting you...

752
01:08:56,940 --> 01:08:58,740
...and the pain went away.

753
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:01,700
Do you understand?

754
01:09:01,870 --> 01:09:03,160
Yes, I do.

755
01:09:03,580 --> 01:09:04,580
Good.

756
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:07,000
You must help me find him.

757
01:09:07,870 --> 01:09:09,120
When we do...

758
01:09:09,370 --> 01:09:11,330
...I'm the one who kills him.

759
01:09:12,710 --> 01:09:15,210
So, you're willing to take a life?

760
01:09:16,170 --> 01:09:17,920
As long as it's Two-Face.

761
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:23,180
Then it will happen this way:

762
01:09:24,390 --> 01:09:25,930
You make the kill.

763
01:09:27,390 --> 01:09:30,520
But your pain doesn't die with Harvey,
it grows.

764
01:09:30,690 --> 01:09:34,520
So you run into the night
to find another face, and another...

765
01:09:35,070 --> 01:09:36,480
...and another...

766
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:40,700
...until one terrible morning
you wake up and realize...

767
01:09:40,860 --> 01:09:43,570
...that revenge has become
your whole life...

768
01:09:44,030 --> 01:09:45,780
...and you won't know why.

769
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:48,870
You can't understand.

770
01:09:49,370 --> 01:09:51,750
Your family wasn't killed by a maniac.

771
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,590
Yes, they were.

772
01:09:55,790 --> 01:09:57,300
We're the same.

773
01:09:57,710 --> 01:10:01,680
If we're the same, help me.
Train me, let me be your partner.

774
01:10:04,430 --> 01:10:05,510
No.

775
01:10:05,970 --> 01:10:07,260
I can't.

776
01:10:08,060 --> 01:10:10,060
You still have a choice.

777
01:10:10,810 --> 01:10:12,020
Look, Bruce...

778
01:10:12,230 --> 01:10:15,150
...I'm a part of this, whether you like it
or not.

779
01:10:32,790 --> 01:10:37,040
<i>Tonight all of Gotham society
has turned out for Edward Nygma's...</i>

780
01:10:37,460 --> 01:10:40,380
<i>...gala unveiling of his New Improved Box.</i>

781
01:10:41,590 --> 01:10:42,760
Thanks, Al.

782
01:10:42,930 --> 01:10:44,010
My pleasure, sir.

783
01:10:44,090 --> 01:10:46,720
<i>They'll be dining
and dancing the night away...</i>

784
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:49,810
<i>...on the glamorous roof
of the Ritz Gotham.</i>

785
01:11:00,990 --> 01:11:04,610
What's it like to have your face
on the cover of every magazine?

786
01:11:05,610 --> 01:11:10,240
Edward, how does it feel to be
the city's newest, most-eligible bachelor?

787
01:11:10,950 --> 01:11:12,660
Gotham must know!

788
01:11:13,620 --> 01:11:15,460
There's Bruce Wayne!

789
01:11:16,460 --> 01:11:17,460
Brucie!

790
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:21,090
Oh, Eddie, he is too cute!

791
01:11:22,670 --> 01:11:24,970
How come you don't look so good
in that suit?

792
01:11:25,050 --> 01:11:27,390
Shut up. You're here to work!

793
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:29,260
How's my mole?

794
01:11:29,350 --> 01:11:30,510
Fine.

795
01:11:30,970 --> 01:11:33,980
What about rumors of a Nygma Tech
takeover of Wayne Enterprises?

796
01:11:34,060 --> 01:11:37,400
Nygma Tech stock is outselling
Wayne Enterprises two to one.

797
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:39,900
Are you yesterday's news, Bruce?

798
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:42,940
Bruce, old man.

799
01:11:43,490 --> 01:11:48,370
The press wonders what it's like
to be outsold, outclassed, out-coifed and...

800
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:51,290
...generally outdone in every way.

801
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:54,200
Hello, Edward. Congratulations.

802
01:11:54,660 --> 01:11:56,710
Great party. Nice suit.

803
01:11:57,330 --> 01:11:58,750
Wit. Good.

804
01:12:00,210 --> 01:12:01,420
And you are?

805
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:02,420
Chase.

806
01:12:04,170 --> 01:12:06,880
And what a grand pursuit you must be.

807
01:12:09,850 --> 01:12:11,600
I'm Bruce Wayne, Miss...?

808
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:15,640
You can call me anything you want.

809
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:19,230
Ladies and gentlemen...

810
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:21,110
...the future!

811
01:12:21,570 --> 01:12:25,860
My New Improved Box offers
fully-interactive holographic fantasies.

812
01:12:46,170 --> 01:12:48,800
Edward, you're dashing and a genius.

813
01:12:49,930 --> 01:12:52,550
How do you create these images, hon?

814
01:12:53,100 --> 01:12:55,680
That, my dear, is my little secret.

815
01:13:03,230 --> 01:13:05,190
Fully-interactive holographs.

816
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:08,780
Only a high-frequency carrier wave,
beamed into the brain...

817
01:13:08,950 --> 01:13:10,610
...could create such images.

818
01:13:10,700 --> 01:13:12,740
And you wish you thought of it.

819
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:15,120
Don't be a sore loser.

820
01:13:15,370 --> 01:13:17,450
Step inside. Give it a try.

821
01:13:19,870 --> 01:13:23,540
If you can introduce images into the mind,
what stops you from...

822
01:13:23,710 --> 01:13:26,130
...extracting images out of the mind?

823
01:13:28,050 --> 01:13:30,630
Too timid to try my machine? Just say so.

824
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:35,470
Shall we dance?

825
01:13:56,660 --> 01:13:58,370
Naughty, naughty.

826
01:13:59,250 --> 01:14:00,830
Looking for something?

827
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,880
I was just wondering how you turn it off.

828
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:08,590
Clever.

829
01:14:09,590 --> 01:14:10,590
Thanks.

830
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:12,090
My pleasure.

831
01:14:41,210 --> 01:14:43,120
<i>Good evening, Mr. Wayne.</i>

832
01:14:44,540 --> 01:14:45,750
<i>Relax.</i>

833
01:14:48,130 --> 01:14:49,710
<i>Tell me your...</i>

834
01:14:50,550 --> 01:14:51,880
<i>...dreams.</i>

835
01:14:53,550 --> 01:14:54,890
<i>Tell me...</i>

836
01:14:55,050 --> 01:14:56,800
<i>...your fantasies.</i>

837
01:14:58,470 --> 01:15:00,350
<i>Tell me your secrets.</i>

838
01:15:02,980 --> 01:15:04,310
<i>Tell me...</i>

839
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:07,230
<i>...your deepest...</i>

840
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:08,820
<i>...darkest...</i>

841
01:15:09,150 --> 01:15:10,480
<i>...fears.</i>

842
01:15:41,180 --> 01:15:42,520
Relax, folks!

843
01:15:42,770 --> 01:15:45,850
It's only an old-fashioned, low-tech stickup!

844
01:15:46,190 --> 01:15:48,190
We're interested in the basics:

845
01:15:48,310 --> 01:15:50,900
Cash, jewelry, cellular telephones.

846
01:15:51,860 --> 01:15:55,530
Hand them over nice and quietly,
and no one will be hurt!

847
01:16:00,530 --> 01:16:02,290
Emergency, Alfred.

848
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:04,330
Yes, sir.

849
01:16:06,330 --> 01:16:08,040
Be calm, everybody!

850
01:16:08,210 --> 01:16:09,630
Just stay calm!

851
01:16:09,790 --> 01:16:11,170
Excuse me!

852
01:16:14,550 --> 01:16:17,550
You're ruining my big party!
Are you insane?

853
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:21,060
We're sick of waiting for you
to deliver Batman.

854
01:16:21,140 --> 01:16:23,220
Patience, O Bifurcated One.

855
01:16:23,350 --> 01:16:25,480
Patience, hell! We want him dead!

856
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:29,270
And nothing brings out the Batman
like a little murder and mayhem!

857
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:31,900
You could have let me in on the caper.

858
01:16:32,070 --> 01:16:36,240
We could have organized it, planned it,
pre-sold the movie rights!

859
01:16:49,830 --> 01:16:52,250
Your entrance was good, his was better.

860
01:17:00,590 --> 01:17:01,850
The difference?

861
01:17:01,930 --> 01:17:03,390
Showmanship!

862
01:17:10,940 --> 01:17:12,360
Emergency, Alfred.

863
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:13,900
Oh, sir....

864
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:16,360
I could be fired for this.

865
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:20,320
Perhaps they'll have me back
at Buckingham Palace.

866
01:17:32,210 --> 01:17:34,460
All right, boys! Phase Two!

867
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:40,510
My place, midnight.

868
01:18:52,750 --> 01:18:54,920
Nothing like a bad case of gas!

869
01:19:27,780 --> 01:19:29,490
Why can't you just die?

870
01:20:22,550 --> 01:20:23,630
Hi.

871
01:20:30,550 --> 01:20:32,180
What were you doing?

872
01:20:32,350 --> 01:20:35,140
You got a real gratitude problem,
you know that?

873
01:20:35,230 --> 01:20:37,810
I need a name. Batboy? Knight Wing?

874
01:20:38,350 --> 01:20:40,520
What's a good sidekick name?

875
01:20:40,730 --> 01:20:42,820
"Dick Grayson, college student."

876
01:20:42,900 --> 01:20:44,030
Screw you!

877
01:20:44,190 --> 01:20:46,240
I saved your life. You owe me.

878
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:48,660
You're going to get yourself killed.

879
01:20:48,860 --> 01:20:50,120
I'm your new partner.

880
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:51,240
No!

881
01:20:51,870 --> 01:20:56,410
Whenever you go out at night, I'll be
watching. Where Batman goes, I'll go.

882
01:20:56,580 --> 01:20:58,460
How will you stop me?

883
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:00,670
I can stop you.

884
01:21:05,260 --> 01:21:07,300
Hang this next to the Batsuit...

885
01:21:07,380 --> 01:21:08,930
...where it belongs.

886
01:21:13,430 --> 01:21:15,430
You're encouraging him.

887
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:20,270
Young men with a mind for revenge
need little encouragement.

888
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:22,270
They need guidance.

889
01:21:23,730 --> 01:21:28,070
You, above all, should know
the consequences of the life you choose.

890
01:21:35,700 --> 01:21:38,460
Even Chase calls being Batman a curse.

891
01:21:39,250 --> 01:21:42,080
Perhaps the lady is just
what the doctor ordered.

892
01:21:42,250 --> 01:21:44,380
She seems lovely and wise.

893
01:21:45,170 --> 01:21:47,300
I've never been in love before.

894
01:21:48,170 --> 01:21:49,550
Go to her.

895
01:21:51,090 --> 01:21:52,760
Tell her how you feel.

896
01:21:52,970 --> 01:21:55,510
She wants Batman, not Bruce Wayne.

897
01:21:56,310 --> 01:21:57,640
Let her decide.

898
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:53,030
I'm sorry.

899
01:22:55,160 --> 01:22:56,990
I can't believe this.

900
01:22:57,790 --> 01:23:01,000
I've imagined this moment
since I first saw you.

901
01:23:01,330 --> 01:23:02,790
Your eyes...

902
01:23:03,710 --> 01:23:05,210
...your lips...

903
01:23:06,710 --> 01:23:08,090
...your body.

904
01:23:10,260 --> 01:23:12,130
Now I have you and...

905
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:16,550
...I'm wishing you were somebody else.

906
01:23:22,020 --> 01:23:24,730
I guess a girl has to grow up sometime.

907
01:23:26,810 --> 01:23:28,520
I've met someone.

908
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:35,660
He's not you.

909
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:40,160
I hope you can understand.

910
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:47,000
I understand.

911
01:23:52,090 --> 01:23:53,300
Well....

912
01:24:15,450 --> 01:24:17,450
That's just what I said.

913
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:20,830
Then I taught my doggie a new trick:

914
01:24:21,620 --> 01:24:23,620
How to map the human mind.

915
01:24:23,870 --> 01:24:27,500
Would you like to see
what Bruce Wayne has in his head?

916
01:24:41,350 --> 01:24:42,930
Riddle me this:

917
01:24:43,810 --> 01:24:45,560
What kind of man...

918
01:24:45,730 --> 01:24:47,810
...has bats on the brain?

919
01:24:51,570 --> 01:24:54,280
-Go ahead. You can say it.
-You're a genius.

920
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:55,740
Oh, stop.

921
01:24:59,370 --> 01:25:01,370
So, from this day on...

922
01:25:01,910 --> 01:25:03,740
...Batman is no more.

923
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:07,670
You can't just quit.

924
01:25:07,830 --> 01:25:11,170
There's monsters out there.
Batman has to protect the innocent.

925
01:25:11,250 --> 01:25:14,840
I've dedicated my life to helping strangers
I've never met.

926
01:25:15,380 --> 01:25:17,300
Faces I've never seen.

927
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:18,840
Well...

928
01:25:19,390 --> 01:25:21,890
...the innocent aren't faceless anymore.

929
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:25,680
You can't tell me what to do
with the rest of my life.

930
01:25:25,770 --> 01:25:28,850
My dad told me that every man goes
his own way.

931
01:25:28,980 --> 01:25:31,020
My way goes to Two-Face.

932
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:33,110
You must help me.

933
01:25:33,690 --> 01:25:35,690
And if you do find Harvey...

934
01:25:35,940 --> 01:25:37,440
...and then you kill him...

935
01:25:37,530 --> 01:25:38,780
...what next?

936
01:25:42,620 --> 01:25:43,700
Exactly.

937
01:25:44,450 --> 01:25:46,750
Then you'd be alone, like me.

938
01:25:49,710 --> 01:25:51,540
No, you must let this go.

939
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,790
Listen to me, I'm your friend.

940
01:25:53,880 --> 01:25:56,460
I don't need a friend, I need a partner.

941
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:58,630
Two-Face has got to pay.

942
01:26:00,130 --> 01:26:01,220
Please.

943
01:26:03,470 --> 01:26:06,930
Chase is coming for dinner.
I'm going to tell her...

944
01:26:07,890 --> 01:26:09,140
...everything.

945
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:13,310
Come upstairs. We'll talk.

946
01:26:28,450 --> 01:26:30,370
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

947
01:26:31,330 --> 01:26:32,670
Happy Halloween.

948
01:26:32,830 --> 01:26:34,590
Happy Halloween to you.

949
01:27:08,870 --> 01:27:13,460
I asked you here tonight because
there's something I wanted to tell you.

950
01:27:14,290 --> 01:27:16,630
I wanted to tell you something too.

951
01:27:17,090 --> 01:27:18,380
What I wanted--

952
01:27:19,510 --> 01:27:21,220
Go ahead, you first.

953
01:27:26,100 --> 01:27:27,680
Trick or treat!

954
01:27:29,640 --> 01:27:31,770
All my life I have been...

955
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:34,980
...attracted to a certain kind of man.

956
01:27:35,100 --> 01:27:36,400
The wrong kind.

957
01:27:36,900 --> 01:27:39,270
Look at what I do for a living.

958
01:27:42,530 --> 01:27:43,900
And since...

959
01:27:44,110 --> 01:27:46,160
...since I met you, I....

960
01:27:48,660 --> 01:27:49,950
Oh, God.

961
01:27:50,410 --> 01:27:52,250
Why am I so nervous?

962
01:28:00,130 --> 01:28:03,920
Don't eat too much tonight
or you'll be sick in your beds.

963
01:28:35,370 --> 01:28:37,040
Happy Halloween!

964
01:28:51,060 --> 01:28:52,470
What's wrong?

965
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:55,020
It's happening again.

966
01:28:55,100 --> 01:28:56,390
Flashes.

967
01:28:57,100 --> 01:28:58,730
My parents' death.

968
01:28:59,900 --> 01:29:02,400
Your memories are trying
to break through.

969
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:04,440
I want to tell you something.

970
01:29:04,570 --> 01:29:06,490
Something I've never told anyone.

971
01:29:06,570 --> 01:29:07,860
It's all right.

972
01:29:08,070 --> 01:29:09,870
It's all right. I'm here.

973
01:29:16,120 --> 01:29:17,460
<i>I'm here.</i>

974
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,130
<i>The night of my parents' wake...</i>

975
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:27,340
<i>...the priest's words gave no comfort.</i>

976
01:29:29,130 --> 01:29:30,510
<i>Of course.</i>

977
01:29:31,850 --> 01:29:33,930
<i>There, on my father's desk...</i>

978
01:29:34,100 --> 01:29:35,770
<i>...the red book.</i>

979
01:29:36,020 --> 01:29:37,480
<i>His journal.</i>

980
01:29:37,850 --> 01:29:39,940
<i>He'd written in it every day.</i>

981
01:29:40,770 --> 01:29:43,150
<i>But now he'd never write in it again.</i>

982
01:29:44,360 --> 01:29:45,860
<i>At that moment I knew...</i>

983
01:29:45,940 --> 01:29:48,110
<i>...my life would never be the same.</i>

984
01:29:54,950 --> 01:29:57,250
<i>I raced out into the storm...</i>

985
01:29:57,870 --> 01:29:59,870
<i>...trying to outrun the rage.</i>

986
01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:01,210
<i>The pain.</i>

987
01:30:02,170 --> 01:30:03,630
<i>Then I fell.</i>

988
01:30:05,550 --> 01:30:07,130
<i>I fell forever.</i>

989
01:30:09,170 --> 01:30:11,180
<i>The cave was monstrous.</i>

990
01:30:12,470 --> 01:30:14,850
<i>It must have been there for centuries.</i>

991
01:30:16,970 --> 01:30:18,180
<i>And there...</i>

992
01:30:18,980 --> 01:30:20,730
<i>...deep in the shadows...</i>

993
01:30:22,190 --> 01:30:23,480
<i>...I saw....</i>

994
01:30:25,900 --> 01:30:27,940
<i>It was coming toward me.</i>

995
01:30:28,740 --> 01:30:31,570
<i>I was scared at first, but only at first.</i>

996
01:30:33,160 --> 01:30:35,870
<i>The figure in the dark was my destiny.</i>

997
01:30:37,080 --> 01:30:39,290
<i>It would change my life forever.</i>

998
01:30:41,500 --> 01:30:46,090
<i>I would use its image to strike terror
into the hearts of those who did evil.</i>

999
01:30:46,210 --> 01:30:50,630
<i>I would ensure what happened to me
would never happen to anyone else.</i>

1000
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:53,590
<i>I would have my revenge.</i>

1001
01:30:57,430 --> 01:30:59,680
What are you trying to tell me?

1002
01:31:02,100 --> 01:31:03,190
I'm....

1003
01:31:38,060 --> 01:31:39,640
Twick or tweet!

1004
01:31:46,810 --> 01:31:48,020
Trick.

1005
01:31:55,160 --> 01:31:56,660
Remember the plan?

1006
01:31:56,820 --> 01:31:58,580
Seize and capture.

1007
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:00,410
No killing.

1008
01:32:00,490 --> 01:32:02,580
That goes double for you.

1009
01:32:05,290 --> 01:32:07,290
If I was a superhero...

1010
01:32:08,170 --> 01:32:10,090
...where would I hide?

1011
01:32:15,050 --> 01:32:16,390
Spank me.

1012
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:31,820
<i>Intruder alert! Intruder alert!</i>

1013
01:32:34,900 --> 01:32:37,030
Intruder alert! Intruder alert!

1014
01:32:37,240 --> 01:32:38,530
Shut up!

1015
01:32:49,250 --> 01:32:51,250
Now, that's impressive!

1016
01:33:07,350 --> 01:33:10,940
It's always risky introducing
a tamed animal into the wild.

1017
01:33:25,250 --> 01:33:28,920
They may have trouble adapting
to their new environment.

1018
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,160
Somebody tell the fat lady...

1019
01:34:09,330 --> 01:34:11,130
...she's on in five.

1020
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:30,730
"Joygasm! "

1021
01:34:53,630 --> 01:34:55,130
Get the girl!

1022
01:35:06,510 --> 01:35:08,100
Don't kill him.

1023
01:35:10,060 --> 01:35:11,690
If you kill him...

1024
01:35:20,530 --> 01:35:22,320
...he won't learn nothing.

1025
01:35:57,730 --> 01:35:59,230
Master Bruce!

1026
01:36:07,070 --> 01:36:08,910
How are you, young man?

1027
01:36:10,290 --> 01:36:13,250
You haven't called me that for a long time.

1028
01:36:13,540 --> 01:36:15,370
Old habits die hard.

1029
01:36:16,250 --> 01:36:17,710
Are you all right?

1030
01:36:18,460 --> 01:36:19,750
Where's Chase?

1031
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:22,090
I'm afraid they've taken her.

1032
01:36:22,420 --> 01:36:24,470
Master Dick has run away.

1033
01:36:25,130 --> 01:36:27,050
The cave has been destroyed.

1034
01:36:28,010 --> 01:36:30,100
And there's another riddle.

1035
01:36:41,030 --> 01:36:42,610
I'm coming, my sweet.

1036
01:36:47,450 --> 01:36:48,820
Like the jacket?

1037
01:36:49,160 --> 01:36:51,160
It keeps me safe when I'm...

1038
01:36:51,330 --> 01:36:53,120
...jogging at night.

1039
01:36:54,040 --> 01:36:55,750
Batman will come for me.

1040
01:36:57,040 --> 01:36:58,290
Batman?

1041
01:36:59,460 --> 01:37:01,130
Batman, you say?

1042
01:37:02,340 --> 01:37:03,920
Coming for you?

1043
01:37:07,340 --> 01:37:08,550
I'm...

1044
01:37:09,180 --> 01:37:10,640
...counting on it.

1045
01:37:15,640 --> 01:37:18,350
What is that? Where's it coming from?

1046
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:20,480
There!

1047
01:37:20,810 --> 01:37:22,520
Who's doing that?

1048
01:37:22,860 --> 01:37:24,320
The Riddler!

1049
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:28,530
"We're five little items of an everyday sort.

1050
01:37:30,200 --> 01:37:32,790
"You'll find us all in a tennis court."

1051
01:37:33,290 --> 01:37:34,370
In....

1052
01:37:34,620 --> 01:37:36,000
A-E-l-O-U.

1053
01:37:37,210 --> 01:37:38,210
Vowels.

1054
01:37:38,370 --> 01:37:40,040
Not entirely unclever, sir.

1055
01:37:40,130 --> 01:37:42,880
But what do a clock, a match,
chess pawns...

1056
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:46,380
...and vowels have in common?
What do these riddles mean?

1057
01:37:46,550 --> 01:37:49,720
Every riddle contains a number
and they arrived in this order:

1058
01:37:49,800 --> 01:37:51,220
13, 1, 8...

1059
01:37:52,470 --> 01:37:53,390
...and 5.

1060
01:37:53,470 --> 01:37:55,060
13, 1, 8 and 5.

1061
01:37:56,390 --> 01:37:57,390
Meaning?

1062
01:37:57,560 --> 01:37:59,270
Letters of the alphabet?

1063
01:37:59,560 --> 01:38:01,360
Of course, 13 is M.

1064
01:38:01,650 --> 01:38:04,650
1 would be A, 8 would be H
and 5 would be E.

1065
01:38:05,320 --> 01:38:06,610
M-A-H-E.

1066
01:38:08,150 --> 01:38:10,160
Perhaps 1 and 8 are 18.

1067
01:38:11,490 --> 01:38:12,780
18 is R.

1068
01:38:13,990 --> 01:38:15,120
M-R-E.

1069
01:38:17,660 --> 01:38:18,830
How about...

1070
01:38:18,910 --> 01:38:20,330
..."Mr. E"?

1071
01:38:20,580 --> 01:38:22,750
-Mystery?
-Another name for mystery?

1072
01:38:22,840 --> 01:38:23,840
Enigma.

1073
01:38:24,340 --> 01:38:25,840
Mr. E. Nygma.

1074
01:38:26,590 --> 01:38:27,920
Edward Nygma.

1075
01:38:28,340 --> 01:38:32,340
Stickley's suicide was obviously
a computer-generated forgery.

1076
01:38:32,470 --> 01:38:35,970
You really are quite bright,
despite what people say.

1077
01:38:36,680 --> 01:38:38,730
Are all the Batsuits destroyed?

1078
01:38:38,930 --> 01:38:43,730
All except the prototype with the sonar
modifications. But it's not tested.

1079
01:38:44,610 --> 01:38:46,320
Tonight's a good night.

1080
01:38:58,290 --> 01:39:00,660
What do you suggest? By sea...

1081
01:39:02,290 --> 01:39:03,750
...or by air?

1082
01:39:08,760 --> 01:39:09,970
Why not both?

1083
01:39:18,970 --> 01:39:20,390
Who's your tailor?

1084
01:39:20,480 --> 01:39:22,520
I took the liberty, sir.

1085
01:39:25,400 --> 01:39:26,440
"R?"

1086
01:39:26,730 --> 01:39:28,400
What's that stand for?

1087
01:39:30,320 --> 01:39:31,320
Robin.

1088
01:39:32,780 --> 01:39:35,660
Riddler and Two-Face can make
a pretty lethal combination.

1089
01:39:35,740 --> 01:39:37,330
You could use a hand.

1090
01:39:37,580 --> 01:39:39,660
Two against two are better odds.

1091
01:39:40,250 --> 01:39:42,580
I can't promise I won't kill Harvey.

1092
01:39:43,210 --> 01:39:45,500
"A man's got to go his own way."

1093
01:39:45,790 --> 01:39:47,500
A friend taught me that.

1094
01:39:48,340 --> 01:39:49,920
Not just a friend.

1095
01:39:52,420 --> 01:39:53,800
A partner.

1096
01:40:27,040 --> 01:40:28,710
He's not coming.

1097
01:40:29,290 --> 01:40:30,800
Shut it down.

1098
01:40:41,060 --> 01:40:43,390
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

1099
01:40:49,480 --> 01:40:50,770
Hey, go!

1100
01:41:22,310 --> 01:41:23,470
A-14.

1101
01:41:29,190 --> 01:41:29,940
Hit!

1102
01:41:30,020 --> 01:41:30,980
Sweet!

1103
01:41:31,820 --> 01:41:32,780
B-12.

1104
01:41:36,780 --> 01:41:37,820
Hit!

1105
01:41:38,320 --> 01:41:39,870
My favorite vitamin.

1106
01:41:49,830 --> 01:41:51,710
That sinking feeling.

1107
01:41:51,920 --> 01:41:53,250
I like this game.

1108
01:41:53,340 --> 01:41:54,460
C-9.

1109
01:42:05,390 --> 01:42:07,390
You sunk my battleship!

1110
01:42:08,230 --> 01:42:09,520
Who, me?

1111
01:42:34,170 --> 01:42:35,800
This is your captain speaking.

1112
01:42:35,880 --> 01:42:39,970
Please return to your seats.
We will be experiencing turbulence.

1113
01:42:47,770 --> 01:42:49,140
I got him!

1114
01:42:55,980 --> 01:42:58,690
I hope they can find the little black box.

1115
01:43:43,820 --> 01:43:45,030
Now...

1116
01:43:47,030 --> 01:43:49,080
...the real game begins.

1117
01:43:56,840 --> 01:43:58,630
Holy rusted metal, Batman!

1118
01:44:00,670 --> 01:44:02,420
The ground, it's all metal.

1119
01:44:02,510 --> 01:44:04,590
It's full of holes: holey.

1120
01:44:09,930 --> 01:44:11,100
Wait!

1121
01:44:13,350 --> 01:44:15,350
The whole island's moving!

1122
01:45:01,480 --> 01:45:03,070
Looking for us?

1123
01:45:07,910 --> 01:45:09,620
That was for my mother!

1124
01:45:10,030 --> 01:45:11,160
My father!

1125
01:45:14,040 --> 01:45:15,250
My brother!

1126
01:45:16,420 --> 01:45:18,040
And this is for me!

1127
01:45:49,660 --> 01:45:51,830
Finally, justice is served!

1128
01:45:53,330 --> 01:45:54,750
Let us die!

1129
01:46:03,550 --> 01:46:06,170
You're a man after our own heart, son!

1130
01:46:06,470 --> 01:46:08,300
I'll see you in hell!

1131
01:46:14,470 --> 01:46:16,310
I'd rather see you in jail!

1132
01:46:20,650 --> 01:46:22,690
Oh, good boy. Good boy.

1133
01:46:23,320 --> 01:46:25,030
The Bat's taught you well.

1134
01:46:25,110 --> 01:46:26,190
Noble.

1135
01:46:26,360 --> 01:46:27,700
Stupid...

1136
01:46:28,320 --> 01:46:29,700
...but noble.

1137
01:47:14,240 --> 01:47:15,830
Riddle me this.

1138
01:47:16,370 --> 01:47:17,950
Riddle me that.

1139
01:47:18,250 --> 01:47:20,790
Who's afraid of the big black bat?

1140
01:47:21,920 --> 01:47:23,630
No more tricks, Edward.

1141
01:47:24,040 --> 01:47:25,630
Very well, then.

1142
01:47:30,380 --> 01:47:31,930
Let's get real.

1143
01:47:32,380 --> 01:47:34,800
Release Chase. This is between you
and me.

1144
01:47:34,890 --> 01:47:35,970
And me...

1145
01:47:36,100 --> 01:47:37,470
...and me!

1146
01:47:40,560 --> 01:47:45,400
You've sucked Gotham's brain waves and
now you've devised a way to read minds.

1147
01:47:47,650 --> 01:47:48,940
You betcha!

1148
01:47:49,190 --> 01:47:53,320
Soon my little Box will be
on countless TV's around the world...

1149
01:47:54,070 --> 01:47:56,660
...feeding me credit-card numbers...

1150
01:47:56,780 --> 01:47:58,450
...bank codes...

1151
01:47:58,660 --> 01:48:00,450
...sexual fantasies...

1152
01:48:00,660 --> 01:48:02,750
...and little white lies.

1153
01:48:03,420 --> 01:48:05,460
Into my head they'll go.

1154
01:48:05,790 --> 01:48:07,710
Victory is inevitable.

1155
01:48:08,590 --> 01:48:10,670
For if knowledge is power...

1156
01:48:11,760 --> 01:48:13,430
...then a god...

1157
01:48:13,590 --> 01:48:14,590
...am...

1158
01:48:15,680 --> 01:48:16,800
...I!

1159
01:48:23,440 --> 01:48:26,230
Was that over the top? I can never tell.

1160
01:48:29,610 --> 01:48:32,440
By the way, I've seen your mind. Freak!

1161
01:48:33,240 --> 01:48:35,200
Yours is the greatest riddle of all!

1162
01:48:35,280 --> 01:48:38,410
Can Bruce Wayne and Batman
ever truly coexist?

1163
01:48:39,790 --> 01:48:41,450
We'll find out today!

1164
01:48:42,710 --> 01:48:45,460
But first, let's meet our contestants.

1165
01:48:46,500 --> 01:48:48,210
Behind curtain...

1166
01:48:49,130 --> 01:48:50,800
...number one...

1167
01:48:54,010 --> 01:48:57,140
...the absolutely fabulous
Dr. Chase Meridian!

1168
01:48:58,470 --> 01:49:00,100
She enjoys hiking, manicures...

1169
01:49:00,180 --> 01:49:03,770
...and foolishly hopes to be the love
of Bruce's life.

1170
01:49:09,730 --> 01:49:11,650
Behind curtain number two...

1171
01:49:14,860 --> 01:49:17,200
..."Fatman's" one and only partner.

1172
01:49:17,660 --> 01:49:19,620
This acrobat turned orphan...

1173
01:49:19,740 --> 01:49:23,410
...likes Saturday-morning cartoons
and dreams of one day being...

1174
01:49:23,540 --> 01:49:25,660
...bare-naked with a girl.

1175
01:49:29,340 --> 01:49:31,550
And below these contestants...

1176
01:49:31,750 --> 01:49:33,760
...my personal favorite:

1177
01:49:34,010 --> 01:49:35,590
A watery grave.

1178
01:49:38,220 --> 01:49:39,930
Just one little touch...

1179
01:49:40,350 --> 01:49:43,520
...and five seconds later
these two players are...

1180
01:49:43,770 --> 01:49:45,850
...gull feed on the rocks below.

1181
01:49:48,770 --> 01:49:50,940
Not enough time to save them both.

1182
01:49:54,900 --> 01:49:57,200
Which one will it be, Batman?

1183
01:49:57,360 --> 01:49:58,700
Bruce's love?

1184
01:49:59,030 --> 01:50:01,660
Or the Dark Knight's junior partner?

1185
01:50:04,580 --> 01:50:07,710
There is no way for me to save them
or myself.

1186
01:50:08,330 --> 01:50:10,670
It's all one giant death-trap.

1187
01:50:11,090 --> 01:50:12,250
Judges?

1188
01:50:13,550 --> 01:50:16,300
I'm sorry. Your answer must be
in the form of a question.

1189
01:50:16,380 --> 01:50:18,130
But thank you for playing.

1190
01:50:18,220 --> 01:50:19,130
Wait!

1191
01:50:20,590 --> 01:50:22,010
I have a riddle for you.

1192
01:50:22,100 --> 01:50:23,260
For me?

1193
01:50:25,100 --> 01:50:26,350
Really?

1194
01:50:29,560 --> 01:50:30,850
Tell me.

1195
01:50:34,570 --> 01:50:36,150
I see without seeing.

1196
01:50:36,940 --> 01:50:39,820
To me, darkness is as clear as daylight.

1197
01:50:41,570 --> 01:50:42,700
What am I?

1198
01:50:44,120 --> 01:50:45,370
Please!

1199
01:50:46,080 --> 01:50:48,160
You're as blind as a bat!

1200
01:50:48,960 --> 01:50:50,000
Exactly.

1201
01:51:27,160 --> 01:51:28,410
Bummer!

1202
01:52:32,940 --> 01:52:34,060
Thanks.

1203
01:52:48,160 --> 01:52:50,080
All those heroics for nothing.

1204
01:52:50,160 --> 01:52:52,960
No more riddles, no more curtains one
and two.

1205
01:52:53,160 --> 01:52:54,960
Just plain curtains!

1206
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,090
Aren't you forgetting something?

1207
01:52:59,250 --> 01:53:00,420
Your coin.

1208
01:53:02,340 --> 01:53:04,170
You're always of two minds.

1209
01:53:05,550 --> 01:53:07,550
Yes, of course. You're right.

1210
01:53:08,180 --> 01:53:10,760
Emotion's always the enemy
of true justice.

1211
01:53:10,850 --> 01:53:13,020
You've always been a good friend.

1212
01:53:59,730 --> 01:54:00,860
Why?

1213
01:54:02,020 --> 01:54:03,400
Why can't I...

1214
01:54:03,530 --> 01:54:04,990
...kill you?

1215
01:54:08,490 --> 01:54:10,280
Too many questions.

1216
01:54:10,820 --> 01:54:12,410
Too many questions.

1217
01:54:13,240 --> 01:54:14,540
Poor Edward.

1218
01:54:15,250 --> 01:54:17,250
I had to save them both.

1219
01:54:17,750 --> 01:54:20,500
You see, I'm both Bruce Wayne
and Batman.

1220
01:54:21,250 --> 01:54:23,170
Not because I have to be.

1221
01:54:23,340 --> 01:54:24,510
Now...

1222
01:54:25,050 --> 01:54:27,050
...because I choose to be.

1223
01:54:50,530 --> 01:54:54,790
Thank you for responding to my request
for a consultation, Dr. Meridian.

1224
01:54:55,160 --> 01:54:56,410
Edward Nygma...

1225
01:54:56,580 --> 01:55:00,420
...has been screaming for hours
that he knows the true identity...

1226
01:55:00,580 --> 01:55:02,080
...of Batman.

1227
01:55:15,850 --> 01:55:17,020
Edward?

1228
01:55:17,850 --> 01:55:19,020
Who...

1229
01:55:19,560 --> 01:55:20,890
...is it?

1230
01:55:23,690 --> 01:55:25,820
It's Dr. Meridian. Chase.

1231
01:55:27,400 --> 01:55:28,990
Do you remember me?

1232
01:55:30,950 --> 01:55:32,660
How could I forget?

1233
01:55:34,450 --> 01:55:36,370
Dr. Burton tells me...

1234
01:55:37,540 --> 01:55:39,460
...you know who Batman is.

1235
01:55:40,460 --> 01:55:43,460
I can't tell you if you don't say, "please."

1236
01:55:44,880 --> 01:55:46,460
Edward, please.

1237
01:55:46,670 --> 01:55:48,210
Who is Batman?

1238
01:55:50,970 --> 01:55:52,180
I'm...

1239
01:55:52,550 --> 01:55:53,930
...Batman.

1240
01:56:20,250 --> 01:56:22,080
Your secret is safe.

1241
01:56:22,250 --> 01:56:24,330
He is definitely a wacko.

1242
01:56:25,580 --> 01:56:26,710
"Wacko?"

1243
01:56:26,920 --> 01:56:28,670
Is that a technical term?

1244
01:56:29,340 --> 01:56:30,420
Listen...

1245
01:56:34,010 --> 01:56:36,180
...I won't need this anymore.

1246
01:56:39,680 --> 01:56:42,310
Thank you for giving me a new dream.

1247
01:56:59,200 --> 01:57:00,870
Don't work too late.
