2
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,293
Darkest Peru.

3
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:42,611
A vast, unexplored wilderness
shrouded in mystery. Until now!

4
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,740
For I have been charged
by my fellow geographers

5
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,100
to leave the comforts of home and family

6
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,568
and set off upon a voyage of discovery.

7
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,140
I travel light, carrying only
the absolute essentials.

8
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,220
Maps, rations, modest timepiece
and travel piano.

9
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:06,361
And finally, deep in the undergrowth,
I spot something extraordinary.

10
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,540
An undiscovered species of bear.

11
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,420
Time to collect a specimen
for the museum.

12
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,403
I thought my time was up,
my ticket was punched.

13
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,620
But the bear saved my life.

14
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,780
He guided me through the jungle
to show me his world,

15
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,060
and in return, I introduced him to ours.

16
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:35,290
That's... That's a telescope.
That's my grandfather's telescope.

17
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,420
Oh, be very careful with that.

18
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,660
That's soap. Really wouldn't eat that.

19
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:46,180
Here we are, why don't you try this?
This is marmalade.

20
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,540
You spread it on toast,
put it in sandwiches, or...

21
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,928
Or you can drink it. Jolly good.

22
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,180
This is London. That's where I'm from.

23
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,521
Lon-don.

24
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,420
Good Lord!

25
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,820
Now try Stratford-upon-Avon.

26
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,140
Over time, I become friends
with the bears and even name them.

27
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,820
The female after my dear departed mother

28
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,242
and the male after an exotic boxer
I once met in a bar.

29
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,340
But the time eventually comes
to return to my wife and daughter

30
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,220
and share my findings with the world.

31
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,051
Goodbye, Lucy. Goodbye, Pastuzo.

32
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:25,660
And if you ever make it to London,
you can be sure of a very warm welcome.

33
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,580
I have learnt so much from these bears

34
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,129
but I wonder what, if anything,
they have learnt from me.

35
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,647
Marmalade!

36
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,286
They're ripe. They're ripe.
They're finally ripe!

37
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,245
Aunt Lucy!

38
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,140
Uncle Pastuzo!

39
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,289
You're never going to guess... Whoa!

40
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,660
Good morning, Aunt Lucy.

41
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,700
Good morning, my little hurricane.

42
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,020
Why do you have to come crashing in here
like a natural disaster?

43
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,540
But, Uncle Pastuzo... they're ripe.

44
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,220
Whoa-ho-ho!

45
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,140
It's Marmalade Day!

46
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,844
Marmalade Day!

47
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,926
Oh, it rather suits me. Marmalade Day!

48
00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:31,140
Do calm down, you two.

49
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,647
There's no need to rush.

50
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,162
Now be careful up there.

51
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,260
And keep your paws off my hat.

52
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,850
I will.

53
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,965
Marmalade.

54
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,340
Just one sandwich contains
all the vitamins and minerals

55
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,180
a bear needs for a whole day.

56
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,380
- Amazing.
- Hmm.

57
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,860
And your Aunt Lucy's recipe
is even better than the explorer's.

58
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,060
We must remember to take him a jar
when we go to London.

59
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,460
London?

60
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,900
I wouldn't worry! We've been talking
about that trip for 40 years.

61
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,940
One day, Pastuzo.

62
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,820
But why would you want to go anywhere

63
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,900
when we live in
the best place in the world?

64
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,810
Whoa!

65
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,927
Whoo-hoo!

66
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,201
Goodness.

67
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,460
I thought I told you to be careful.

68
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,980
And give me back my hat.

69
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,140
- Yes, Uncle. But...
- No buts.

70
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,608
It's about time I got a bit of respect
around here.

71
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,490
Embarrassing.

72
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,740
But tasty.

73
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,620
Friendly advice for the foreigner
in London. Lesson three.

74
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,122
It's dusk, and you pass a stranger
in the street.

75
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,380
- Greet them politely.
- Good evening.

76
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,300
To take the conversation further,
talk about the weather.

77
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,460
Real brolly-buster, isn't it?

78
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,580
Fact: Londoners have 107 ways
to say that it is raining...

79
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,260
- Can I have the last sandwich?
- Oh, no, I need that.

80
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,380
A wise bear always keeps
a marmalade sandwich in his hat

81
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,340
in case of emergency.

82
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,380
...and it's bucketing down.

83
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:35,060
Follow these simple rules and you will
always feel at home in London.

84
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,402
- Aunt Lucy?
- Earthquake!

85
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,963
Get to the shelter!

86
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,940
Oh!

87
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,441
- Aunt Lucy!
- Keep going!

88
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,845
Are you alright?

89
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,567
Uncle Pastuzo!

90
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,807
Uncle Pastuzo!

91
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,806
Get down!

92
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,484
Uncle Pastuzo?

93
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,051
Pastuzo?

94
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,842
Uncle Pastuzo?

95
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,767
Aunt Lucy.

96
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,042
What are we going to do?

97
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,161
Stay out of sight until London.

98
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,081
But... aren't you coming?

99
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,940
I am too old and too tired
to go any further.

100
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,940
Oh. Then, what will you do?

101
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,362
Oh, don't you worry about me.

102
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,660
I will be safe
in the home for retired bears.

103
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:31,620
But it is not yet time
for you to retire.

104
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:35,260
You must find a new home. In London.

105
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,366
But... But I don't know anyone there.
What if they don't even like bears?

106
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:46,300
You know, there was once a war
in the explorer's country.

107
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:50,060
Thousands of children
were sent away for safety,

108
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,980
left at railway stations
with labels around their necks,

109
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:59,530
and unknown families took them in
and loved them like their own.

110
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,966
They will not have forgotten
how to treat a stranger.

111
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,820
Now take care, my darling.
Remember your manners.

112
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,243
And keep safe.

113
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,411
Oh.

114
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,442
OK, I'll just get it now.

115
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,884
I'll throw it down.

116
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,010
Hi.

117
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,445
London.

118
00:11:22,773 --> 00:11:25,971
Oh, right. Yes. Manners. Here goes.

119
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,300
Good morning.
Really tipping it down, isn't it?

120
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,700
Strange.

121
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,246
How do you do?
I'm just looking for a home. And I...

122
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,780
Hello?

123
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,325
Excuse me...

124
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,084
Does anyone know where I...
where I can find a home?

125
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,241
Anyone?

126
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,020
Passengers are reminded to keep their
belongings with them at all times.

127
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,660
Unattended items will be taken away
and could be destroyed.

128
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,980
Oh, dear.

129
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:04,889
Oh, hello.

130
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,637
You hungry?

131
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,340
Me, too.

132
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:15,180
But this is all I've got left.
It's really just for emergency.

133
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,724
Oh, go on then.

134
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,780
Ah, right, I see what I've done.

135
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,327
Come on, you can't
all be having emergencies.

136
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,140
Can you all just go away, please?
I need to look presentable.

137
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,210
- That was so boring.
- I'm sorry you feel like that,

138
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,700
but it was my week to choose and I
enjoyed the Victorian Wool Experience.

139
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,820
At least we spent time together
as a family.

140
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,700
- And we learnt a lot about wool.
- Did you have fun, pumpkin?

141
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,620
It's Judy, and it was fine
until you jumped in the lake.

142
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,660
It's a bathing pond.
It's what you're supposed to do.

143
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,420
- Not naked!
- Well, I forgot my costume.

144
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,380
Jonathan, don't jump like that.

145
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,260
Seven per cent of childhood accidents
start with jumping.

146
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,020
- If I'm gonna be an astronaut...
- You're not "gonna" be.

147
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,020
You can be whatever you want, peanut.

148
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,940
- Oh, stranger danger.
- What?

149
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,860
Keep your eyes down.
There's some sort of bear over there.

150
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,220
- Probably selling something.
- Good evening.

151
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,163
No, thank you.

152
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,526
Oh, dear.

153
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,362
Must be doing something wrong.

154
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,380
Hello there.

155
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,766
Mary!

156
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,407
Oh. Hello.

157
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,900
Coming down in stair rods, isn't it?

158
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,331
Oh...

159
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,180
Yes.

160
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,850
- Mum...
- Er...

161
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:53,500
I hope you don't mind me asking,
but shouldn't you be at home?

162
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,740
Oh, yes, I should. But... I haven't
quite worked out how to find one.

163
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,900
- Where are your parents?
- They died when I was small.

164
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,651
- Here we go.
- All I have left is my aunt.

165
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,460
- And where's she?
- Darkest Peru.

166
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,140
- In the home for retired bears.
- Yeah, course she is.

167
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,740
How did you get here?

168
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,780
- I stowed away. In a lifeboat.
- Cool!

169
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,540
And ate marmalade.
Did you know bears like marmalade?

170
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,980
I didn't even know bears could talk.

171
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,700
Well, I'm a very rare bear.

172
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,940
There aren't many of us left.

173
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,460
And what are you going to do now?

174
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:27,420
Well, I thought I would probably
just sleep over there in that bin.

175
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,420
That's the spirit. Anyway...

176
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,140
- Dad!
- Why don't we find you some help?

177
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,220
Oh, yes, please.
If you're sure it's no trouble?

178
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,005
Of course it isn't. Is it, darling?

179
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,089
Not at all.

180
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,850
- Oh, yes, that is good.
- So...

181
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,660
- What's your name?
- Hmm?

182
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,206
- Do bears even have names?
- Of course we do.

183
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,984
My name is...

184
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,100
Beg your pardon?

185
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,566
Right.

186
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,980
- Well, go on.
- Hmm?

187
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,980
You try it.

188
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,048
Back of the throat.

189
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:27,566
Mr Brown, that is extremely rude.

190
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,980
Oh, at last.

191
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,660
Oh. Er, wait for me.

192
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,660
Is someone coming to get him?

193
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,860
Everyone's gone.
He'll have to come with us.

194
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,300
- No way.
- Dad!

195
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,846
- Stay where you are.
- He's so embarrassing.

196
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,380
We can't leave him here.

197
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,260
We can. He's not our responsibility.

198
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,931
He's a young bear
who needs our help, Henry.

199
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:52,300
It's just for one night, until we can
find the right people to look after him.

200
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,164
There you are.

201
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,700
- OK.
- Yes!

202
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,020
- Excuse me?
- Hello.

203
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,020
I'm dreadfully sorry,
I don't actually know your name.

204
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,900
Well, I've got a bear name, but it seems
to be rather hard to pronounce.

205
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,020
That's not ripe.

206
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:16,331
- Perhaps you'd like an English name.
- An English name? Like what?

207
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,140
Oh, look, Henry, it's perfect.

208
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,100
You want to call him Ketchup?
Ketchup the bear?

209
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,340
- Paddington!
- Paddington?

210
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,010
Paddington.

211
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,900
Pa-dding-ton.

212
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,660
Paddington!

213
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,762
Sorry! I like it.

214
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:45,723
Well, then, Paddington, how would you
like to come home with us?

215
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,130
London is the place for me

216
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,968
London, that lovely city

217
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,140
You could go to France or America

218
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,447
India, Asia or Australia

219
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,928
You're gonna come back to London City

220
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,922
London is the place for me

221
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:21,447
Oh! What sort of route do you call that?

222
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,580
Well, the young bear
said it was his first time in London.

223
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,330
I thought I'd show him the sights.

224
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,580
- Should've charged more!
- Keep the change.

225
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,980
Cheer up, mate. Might never happen.

226
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,162
Darling, have you got your keys?

227
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,780
Come on, Paddington.

228
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,180
Oh, yes.

229
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,529
But this... this is wonderful!

230
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,460
Do you know,
I was actually beginning to think

231
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,740
nobody would give me a home,
but this...! That's ripe.

232
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,020
This will suit me down to the ground.
Thank you very much.

233
00:18:19,697 --> 00:18:21,820
We're not giving you a home.

234
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,888
- Oh?
- It's just for the night.

235
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,300
You see, when a young person
comes to this country,

236
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,500
I'm afraid they don't just move in
with the first people they meet.

237
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,900
- No?
- You need a proper guardian.

238
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,020
What's that?

239
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,100
A grown-up who takes you
into their home and looks after you.

240
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,440
Like you?

241
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,820
Erm... Yes, well, I suppose so.

242
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,763
But not you?

243
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,100
No. We don't do that.

244
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,900
- It's normally someone you know.
- But what if you don't know anybody?

245
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,940
In that case, the authorities will house
you in some kind of government facility.

246
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,860
What? Like an orphanage?

247
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,220
No, no, no, not an orphanage.

248
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,500
It would be more like an institution
for young souls

249
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:13,020
whose parents have sadly passed on.

250
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,689
Oh.

251
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,820
- Well, what about the explorer?
- Who?

252
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:25,300
The man who visited us in Darkest Peru.
He said we'd always be welcome.

253
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,780
Well, what's his name? You could go now.

254
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,008
Ooh, well, I don't know his human name.

255
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,420
My uncle and aunt hadn't learnt
much English back then,

256
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,760
so they always called him...

257
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,420
There can't be that many explorers
who've been to Peru.

258
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,820
Maybe we can find him.

259
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,100
Without a name?
I wouldn't get your hopes up.

260
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,204
Right, come on, you. Pyjamas.

261
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,481
Jonathan!

262
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,868
Walk.

263
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,580
Don't worry, Paddington.

264
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,728
- We'll find him.
- Oh, thank you.

265
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,500
Let's look in the encyclopaedia,

266
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,260
unless, of course,
you'd like to freshen up first.

267
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,900
I beg your pardon?

268
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,580
You know, use the facilities?
Most people do after a long journey.

269
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:13,368
Oh. Well, if that's what most people do,
then I'd like to do that.

270
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,845
- Top of the stairs.
- Top of the... Ah, stairs.

271
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,011
OK. You're going that way. Got it.

272
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,682
- Are you alright?
- All good.

273
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,650
Hello. This is Henry Brown.
32 Windsor Gardens.

274
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:30,082
I just need to add something
to my home insurance policy.

275
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,980
Well, what it is, is we have
a guest for the night, a bear,

276
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,940
and I just needed some extra cover
for any da... Yes, a bear.

277
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,371
No, a real one.

278
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,408
About three foot six.

279
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,020
Grizzly? Not particularly.

280
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,926
Mind you, I haven't seen him
in the mornings.

281
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,060
So, how much would that be?

282
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,860
Batten down the hatches, young 'un.
There'll be a storm tonight.

283
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,620
The radio said it was clearing up.

284
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,900
Radio! I feel it in my knees.
My knees never lie.

285
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,685
- Guess what, Mrs Bird! We found a bear!
- Uh-huh.

286
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,580
- A real bear from Peru!
- That's nice, dear.

287
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,260
You don't seem very surprised.

288
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,728
I gave up being surprised when
they came up with the microwave oven.

289
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,490
And I still don't trust you.

290
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,660
Thank you for holding. Your call is...

291
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,445
- ...moderately...
- ...important to us.

292
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,041
Help.

293
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,500
- Where's he going to sleep?
- Not in my room. He's a he.

294
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,602
- Tony's a he.
- Shut up.

295
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,100
And Tony would be more than welcome
to a bunk-up.

296
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,740
- Who's Tony?
- I'm warning you.

297
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:58,220
- Just some boy she's in love with.
- No? Darling, really?

298
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,800
- That's it!
- When can I meet him?

299
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,524
Can I meet him? Darling?

300
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:11,140
- He can sleep in my room.
- He's not sleeping in anyone's room.

301
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,740
He's going in the attic.
I want you all to lock your doors.

302
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,500
I can't find anything
about an English explorer in Peru.

303
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,620
- Of course you can't.
- Why not?

304
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,460
He's making the whole thing up. It's the
sort of sob story your mother falls for.

305
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,860
- Hang on. That's not fair.
- It so is fair.

306
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,645
You've literally just brought home
a random bear.

307
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,340
- So embarrassing.
- You'd have done the same thing.

308
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,807
We're much more similar than you think.

309
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,740
- What are you doing?
- The storm is upon us.

310
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:40,300
Oh, you and your knees.
I can tell you for a fact, Mrs Bird,

311
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,164
it is not going to rain indoors.

312
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,327
- Oh, no.
- There she blows.

313
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:53,044
- Mr Brown, are you there?
- Yes, hello.

314
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,889
Yes, that sounds fine.

315
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,580
No, no, no, don't read me
the terms and conditions.

316
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:02,260
I want to action this as soon
as possible. Don't put me on hold again!

317
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,806
Paddington? What is going on in there?

318
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:09,881
Er, nothing. I'm just having
a spot of bother with the facilities.

319
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,780
Erm... Nice weather for the ducks?

320
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,202
That was amazing.

321
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:52,780
Dear Aunt Lucy. I have arrived in London

322
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:58,250
and so far it has rained, poured,
drizzled and chucked it down.

323
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,763
And I miss you.

324
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,460
London is not how we imagined it.

325
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,540
Hardly anyone says hello or wears hats.

326
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,340
And you can no longer simply
turn up at the station and get a home.

327
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,740
It's hard to see where a bear
could ever belong

328
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,605
in such a strange, cold city.

329
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:23,500
Luckily, I met the Browns, who are
letting me sleep in their attic.

330
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,060
They have a lovely house, but I'm not
going to be allowed to stay.

331
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,940
That animal is going
straight to the authorities.

332
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:33,100
- What about the explorer?
- There is no explorer.

333
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,820
I'm not putting this family in danger
while you go on some wild-goose chase.

334
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,780
First thing tomorrow,
that bear is out of here.

335
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:43,300
The Browns are a very curious tribe.

336
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,100
Mr Brown is something called
a risk analyst.

337
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:50,860
He says that having a bear in the house
increases the chances of major disaster

338
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,644
by 4,000%.

339
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,500
Mrs Brown illustrates adventure stories.

340
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:02,420
Her latest is set in the old tunnels
and sewers under London.

341
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,180
She says she's stuck at the moment

342
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:07,060
because she can't imagine
what her hero looks like,

343
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:10,380
but has no trouble coming up with
nicknames for her daughter Judy,

344
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,380
- like "twinkle" and "coconut" and...
- Sweety pops? Hello, darling.

345
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,060
I was thinking of going
to the sewers tomorrow night.

346
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:22,121
I just wondered if you wanted
to join me. You could bring this Tony.

347
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,411
Why would I want to bring anyone
down the toilet?

348
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,300
Come on, darling, it's not like that.

349
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:31,500
It's a subterranean labyrinth
that can take you anywhere in the city.

350
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,046
It's weird, it smells
and it's embarrassing.

351
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,340
Sure. Good point.

352
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,940
Judy suffers from a serious condition

353
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,460
called "embarrassment".

354
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:43,660
She is seeing a boy called Tony
but won't bring him home.

355
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:48,084
- So, when can I come round your house?
- That's never gonna happen.

356
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,540
She is learning Chinese...

357
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:53,201
Could you tell me the way
to the central business district?

358
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:57,340
...so she can run away
and start a small business.

359
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,602
I have been accused of insider trading

360
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,300
and require legal representation.

361
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,700
When Jonathan grows up,
he wants to be an astronaut.

362
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,220
Last year he built
a pair of rocket boots...

363
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,766
Three, two, one.

364
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,980
...and is now only allowed to play

365
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:18,260
with safe, educational, indoor toys
from the olden days.

366
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,780
They live with an old relative
called Mrs Bird.

367
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:27,601
Her husband was in the Navy, and she
still likes everything shipshape.

368
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,660
Tomorrow, they are taking me
to the authorities,

369
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,980
who will house me in something
that is not an orphanage,

370
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:40,449
but still doesn't sound like the sort
of home we were really hoping for.

371
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,480
Can't you sleep?

372
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,485
Me neither.

373
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,460
I do wish we could have
found the explorer.

374
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,500
I know, Paddington.
But I've been looking everywhere

375
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,900
and I still can't find any mention
of an English expedition to Peru.

376
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,300
But there really was an explorer,
Mrs Brown. He gave my uncle this hat.

377
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,540
What, that was the explorer's hat?

378
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,642
Hm-hmm. Why?

379
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:09,980
I've got a friend who runs
an antiques shop in the Portobello Road.

380
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,180
He knows all about old things
like your hat.

381
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,380
Oh...

382
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:16,140
it's just possible
he could help us find your explorer.

383
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,940
Well, that would be wonderful.

384
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,420
- But didn't Mr Brown say...
- Don't you worry about Mr Brown.

385
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,620
As far as he's concerned,
we're going to the authorities.

386
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,281
But I'm not standing by while there's
a chance of finding you a proper home.

387
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,802
Now make sure you get some sleep, OK?

388
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,885
Night-night.

389
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:42,420
Tomorrow,
we are going to find the explorer.

390
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,300
Love from Paddington.

391
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,460
Oh.

392
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:48,404
PS. That is now my name.

393
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,164
Good evening, Grant.

394
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,130
Madam Director.

395
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,041
Another delivery from the docks?

396
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,326
Bring it through.

397
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,725
Yes!

398
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:02,408
You are going to make
a fantastic addition to the collection.

399
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,860
Aren't you worried
people will ask questions?

400
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:09,580
Not at all. As far as the tree-huggers
who run this place are concerned,

401
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,860
I'd never dream of stuffing
a poor defenceless animal.

402
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,980
However, it's not enough for me just
to look after this dusty old collection.

403
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:21,289
I need to add the odd choice specimen
of my own.

404
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,580
There was some weird sort of animal
at the dock today.

405
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,100
Oh, yes?

406
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,283
Yeah. I was doing my rounds as usual

407
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,244
when I spotted something sticky
on the deck of the boat.

408
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,248
I think they were paw prints.

409
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,020
Whatever it was that had made them

410
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,202
had hidden himself away in the lifeboat.

411
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,460
Must have been in there
all the way from Peru.

412
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,801
Seems to have lived
on nothing but marmalade.

413
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,083
Did you say marmalade?

414
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,340
- Hmm.
- What happened to him?

415
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,460
- He sneaked out in the mail van.
- Yes?

416
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,380
- I tracked him to Paddington.
- Good.

417
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,766
But then he disappeared.

418
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:01,020
I'm sorry. It's just that that creature
means a great deal to me.

419
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,407
Why? Is he endangered?

420
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,970
He is now.

421
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,126
Oof!

422
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:33,601
Now, I know you all like marmalade,
but this is my sandwich.

423
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:44,166
You're not using those ear brushes
to clean your mouth, are you, Mr Brown?

424
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,940
Peculiar habit.

425
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,166
Morning!

426
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,365
Awesome.

427
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,660
Jonathan. Don't even think about it.

428
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,580
34 per cent of pre-breakfast accidents
involve banisters.

429
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,286
- But Paddington...
- I don't care what Paddington...

430
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,140
- It's so annoying, Mum.
- What is, pumpkin?

431
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,844
All my bathroom stuff is ruined.

432
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:25,100
Well, I've never liked you
using harsh chemicals, darling.

433
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,202
They play havoc on people's skin.

434
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,368
- Morning, Judy.
- Hello.

435
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:34,402
- Why is Dad so boring and annoying?
- It's for your own good.

436
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,860
Be nice, darlings.

437
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,740
All I was trying to do was wash my face.

438
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,126
Oh.

439
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,891
Better?

440
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,930
Come on, you two,
or you'll be late for school.

441
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,321
Heck of a racket coming
from your way last night, Brown.

442
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,700
Hello, Mr Curry.
I'm sorry if we disturbed you.

443
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,881
Good morning.

444
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,922
- I don't believe I've had the pleasure.
- Mr Curry, this is Paddington.

445
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,740
- He's a bear.
- I can see that.

446
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:09,208
- You must be a long way from home.
- I'm from Darkest Peru.

447
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,365
- Oh.
- Don't worry, Mr Curry, he's going.

448
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,449
Just as well. Don't want to be kept up
by any of your loud jungle music.

449
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,100
Don't tell anyone at school
about Paddington.

450
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,361
Why not?

451
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,689
Because everyone thinks
we're weird enough without the bear.

452
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,290
Ba, ba, ba, ba

453
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,860
Ba, ba, ba, ba

454
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,291
Ba, ba, ba, ba...

455
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,125
Hello there.

456
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,821
Dog!

457
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,580
Where's that bear? Now, watch out.
There are thieves, murderers

458
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:52,220
and pickpockets on every platform.
So follow us

459
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,402
- and do exactly as you're told.
- Right-o.

460
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,360
Thank you.

461
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,606
Officer.

462
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:15,940
So, about the authorities.
I've printed off directions.

463
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,220
Oh. Laminated.

464
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,860
- The green arrows are to make...
- Thank you, darling.

465
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,485
I know exactly where I'm going.

466
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,887
- Where's Paddington?
- What?

467
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,740
Oh! Paddington.

468
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,251
Paddington!

469
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,921
Oh!

470
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,167
Wow, I feel good

471
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,644
I knew that I would now

472
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,482
I feel good

473
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,522
I knew that I would now

474
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,366
So good

475
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,380
So good

476
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,448
I got you

477
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,050
Paddington?

478
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,620
Paddington!

479
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,166
- Over here!
- Coming.

480
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:24,330
That one's mine, thank you.

481
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:28,050
I assume he's yours.

482
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,420
Tell you what, Paddington.

483
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:34,491
It's not far to my friend's
antiques shop. Why don't we walk?

484
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,940
- Mrs Brown. Come in.
- You must be Mr Gruber.

485
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:43,900
And you must be the young gentleman
whose hat sounds so fascinating.

486
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,380
Welcome. You're just in time
for elevenses.

487
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,740
Every morning it arrives at 11 o'clock,

488
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,980
bringing salvation.

489
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:17,340
Just like a train that I took
many years ago.

490
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,900
- Really?
- Oh, yes. You see,

491
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,660
there was a lot of trouble
in my country.

492
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:27,300
So my parents sent me
all the way across Europe,

493
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,483
when I was not much older
than you are now.

494
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,648
Was it hard to find a home?

495
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,001
I had a great-aunt who took me in.

496
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,250
Master Gruber?

497
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:44,528
But I soon learnt a home
is more than a roof over your head.

498
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:54,530
My body had travelled very fast
but my heart...

499
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:58,530
she took a little longer to arrive.

500
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,220
But now I should like
to take a look at your hat.

501
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,980
- Oh, thank you.
- Unusual colour.

502
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:10,290
But it is hard to say how much of that
is original and how much...

503
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,780
Marmalade?

504
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,380
My uncle always kept
a marmalade sandwich in his hat

505
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,020
in case of emergency.

506
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:21,220
You're pulling my legs off.
What a splendid idea.

507
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:24,300
Ooh. Now, if you look carefully,

508
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,687
you can see your hat
has been hand stitched,

509
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,940
which suggests it is one of a kind.

510
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,380
- Really?
- Yes.

511
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,561
Hello there.

512
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,687
- Oh, wait a minute.
- It's very subtle.

513
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,610
- Oh, Paddington!
- The gentleman dropped his wallet!

514
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,165
Where is he?

515
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,203
- Mind out!
- Stop!

516
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,164
Come back!

517
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,485
What's he doing?

518
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,460
- Excuse me. Coming through.
- Careful!

519
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,722
Just trying to return
some lost property.

520
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,444
Hey, what are you doing?

521
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,900
Whoa!

522
00:38:01,403 --> 00:38:02,567
Sorry!

523
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,488
Oi, come back!

524
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,891
Some kind of tiny police bear.

525
00:38:19,482 --> 00:38:21,100
You!

526
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,420
What do you think you're doing?

527
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:25,220
Trying to return some lost property.

528
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:28,529
Get away from here! Leave my dog alone!

529
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,500
Do you want a biscuit?

530
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:37,764
Charlie Delta. Officer in distress.
Urgent assistance required. Go, go, go.

531
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,766
In 100 yards, bear left.

532
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,220
I've got your wallet!

533
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,860
Whoo-hoo!

534
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,486
It's actually quite good fun.

535
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,124
The Winter's Tale

536
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,220
contains Shakespeare's
most famous stage direction:

537
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:14,420
- "Exit, pursued by a..."
- Paddington?

538
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,921
- Paddington?
- Look, a bear!

539
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,648
You... dropped your wallet.

540
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:32,122
Gosh, you've got quite a few.

541
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,490
He certainly has.

542
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:43,287
No, you don't understand. I was just
trying to return some lost property.

543
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,323
Oh, hello, Judy.

544
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,820
- Do you know that bear?
- Erm...

545
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,251
He's awesome.

546
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,731
- Yeah, he's called Paddington.
- Thank you.

547
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,340
Thank you.

548
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,420
- Well done.
- Bear of the moment!

549
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:01,540
Oh, really? I just did
what any bear would do.

550
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,060
I can't thank you enough.

551
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:06,980
That scoundrel has been pocket-picketing
people around here for weeks.

552
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,460
He was extraordinary.

553
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,380
And it gave me
a chance to look at his hat.

554
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:14,140
- You see, this is no ordinary hat.
- No?

555
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:20,100
No. These markings mean that it was made
for a member of the Geographers' Guild.

556
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,406
What's that?

557
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,740
A very old explorers' club.

558
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,740
- Oh!
- Go and see them in the morning,

559
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,340
and if luck has been smiling
on your face,

560
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:31,125
they should be able to tell you
who they made it for.

561
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:35,300
OK. Protein.

562
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,340
- Per biscuit?
- Per biscuit.

563
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,649
- 0.5 grams.
- Yes.

564
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,620
Carbohydrates.

565
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,260
- Per biscuit?
- Per biscuit.

566
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:49,126
- Is 7.7 grams.
- Yes.

567
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,660
- Sodium.
- Ooh...

568
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,140
- I know this one.
- Yeah. Do you?

569
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,447
- Is it trace?
- Not trace.

570
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:21,771
It's him! After all these years,
it's really him!

571
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:27,366
You're stuffed, bear.

572
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,820
- One night, you said. One night!
- I know...

573
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,180
You promised to take him
to the authorities.

574
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,060
- I never promised.
- Well, you very heavily implied it.

575
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:40,245
I'm sorry, but he was telling the truth.
There really is an explorer.

576
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:44,260
- What are you doing?
- I'm doing my looking-away face.

577
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,820
- Are you doing the breathing?
- I'm doing the breathing.

578
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,700
All we need to do is take him
to the Geographers' Guild.

579
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,245
- Stop!
- The hand's gone up.

580
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:54,260
- We've done quite enough for this bear.
- And the voice.

581
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:57,220
- I am taking charge!
- You're taking charge?

582
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,780
Yes! Paddington
is a danger to this family.

583
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:02,140
Jonathan is quite irresponsible enough

584
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,980
without throwing a wild animal
into the mix.

585
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:08,084
Hey, Paddington.
Have you seen the paper?

586
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,260
Gosh.

587
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:13,220
You've only been in London a day
and you're already famous.

588
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,004
Oh.

589
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,740
I'm sorry if I wasn't very nice before.

590
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:22,380
It's just it's a new school and I didn't
want everyone to think I was weird.

591
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:26,280
Oh, I understand, Judy.
It's not easy being somewhere new.

592
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,140
No, it isn't.

593
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,402
He put earwax on my toothbrush!

594
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,500
Things can be very different
from how you imagined.

595
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:38,127
Don't let him bother you. Dad's always
been boring and annoying.

596
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:41,642
Oh, I don't know about that.
More to your father than meets the eye.

597
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,460
- Like what?
- When I first met him,

598
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,460
he was a very different man.

599
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,660
Get your motor running

600
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,100
Whoo!

601
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,300
- Head out on the highway
- Wahey!

602
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,846
- Looking for adventure
- That's my girl.

603
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,767
And whatever comes our way

604
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:04,300
- Not gonna let this change us, right?
- No way, baby.

605
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,768
- Born to be wild
- We're having a baby!

606
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:16,046
But becoming a father
does strange things to a man.

607
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,780
Be careful, there's a baby here.
Step back, there's a baby coming through.

608
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:23,260
Could you keep those flowers away, please?
She's too young for pollen.

609
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:25,700
- Where's the bike, darling?
- This is our new car.

610
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,300
What? It's very beige, isn't it?

611
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,220
It's a calm and neutral colour. Get in.

612
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:34,860
The point is, your father loves you
very much. Give him a chance.

613
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,610
He might just surprise you.

614
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,820
Oh.

615
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:41,380
Maybe you and Dad
just need a fresh start.

616
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:45,380
I suppose I didn't make
the best first impression.

617
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:47,540
Don't take this the wrong way but...

618
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:50,644
why don't we try to make you
look a bit more presentable?

619
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,283
Hang on a minute.
You're not talking about...

620
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,601
the facilities?

621
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:01,780
- Relax, Paddington, it's not that bad.
- It is that bad.

622
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:06,363
Doesn't it rain enough in this city
without having showers in the house?

623
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:23,602
The point is, we are parents now
and we have to protect our children.

624
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,380
We do.

625
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:28,245
- They're screaming.
- That's the sound of laughter.

626
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,180
Wind. Hot wind. Two hot winds.

627
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,980
I don't like it.

628
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,085
Well, I hope I don't look weird
after all that.

629
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:42,620
- Too much?
- Too much.

630
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,007
Too much?
Well, get me a brush, will you?

631
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,922
There it is.

632
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,889
- That's my old duffle coat.
- Actually, it was mine first.

633
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,128
Well, long before that, it was mine.

634
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:57,340
- Oh, was it, Mr Brown?
- Really?

635
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,820
- He wore it on his first day at school.
- It's lovely.

636
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:03,500
Wooden buttons for ease of paw.

637
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,460
And these two sandwich compartments
are an excellent idea.

638
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,700
I must say, it suits you very well.

639
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,260
I never thought
I'd like a human coat, but...

640
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:13,840
You look like one of the family.

641
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:17,643
You're not going to send Paddington
to the authorities, are you?

642
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,408
You will try the Geographers' Guild?

643
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:30,380
Yes, alright, we'll see
if they know anything.

644
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,211
- But if it's a dead end...
- I'm sure it won't be.

645
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:36,051
Thank you very much, Mr Brown.

646
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:46,100
You must get a lot of strange customers
in here.

647
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:48,043
You don't know the half of it, love.

648
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:51,860
I've had bishops, magicians, bears,
contortionists.

649
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:53,540
Did you say bears?

650
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,740
Yeah. Had one in here last night,
actually.

651
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:59,340
Oh! How fascinating. I don't suppose
you remember where you took him?

652
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,060
- 'Fraid I can't tell you that, love.
- Why not?

653
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:05,340
- It's against the Cabbie's Code, innit?
- The what?

654
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,740
The Cabbie's Code!
It's an oath of confidentiality we take.

655
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:12,300
You know, like your doctors,
your priests, your medieval knights.

656
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,460
You do understand, don't you, love?

657
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,210
Of course.

658
00:46:17,950 --> 00:46:20,660
Let me tell you about my code.

659
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:24,780
When somebody doesn't give me
what I want, I remove their body parts.

660
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,900
I start with the nasal hair.

661
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,208
And then I move on to something juicy.

662
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,004
That's my code and I always stick to it.

663
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:36,860
Do you always stick to yours?

664
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,100
- Well, it's not even really a code.
- No?

665
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:42,620
It's more a set of guidelines
than a binding ethos.

666
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,940
Then tell me,
where did you take the bear?

667
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:48,850
- Windsor Gardens!
- Thank you.

668
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:53,247
I wouldn't go up the Westway this
time of night. You wanna go north...

669
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:58,180
- Bye, Paddington.
- Goodbye, Jonathan.

670
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:00,681
- Good luck.
- Bye, Paddington.

671
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:05,410
Bye. I hope you all have a good day.

672
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:11,251
I really do like these French
sandwiches, Mrs Bird. Very exotic.

673
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:14,180
- Can I help you, son?
- Just a sec.

674
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:17,060
You've been in there for 47 minutes.
Either a very long call

675
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:20,660
or you're placing unauthorised
advertising in a public phone box.

676
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:22,180
I'm terribly sorry.

677
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:25,300
Hello

678
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:30,180
Is it me you're looking for?
I can see...

679
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,620
No problem... madam.

680
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,780
Many apologies if I disturbed you.
It's just,

681
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:38,620
I keep an eye on all
the comings and goings and...

682
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:41,660
there's been a few unsavoury
characters hanging around.

683
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,100
Let's get this over and done with.

684
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:47,940
There's even been a bear.
A most unpleasant creature.

685
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:52,648
As a matter of fact,
that bear is the reason I'm here.

686
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:07,380
Welcome to the Geographers' Guild.
Are you members?

687
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:09,460
No, but we are looking for one.

688
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:12,980
- The name?
- We don't actually know the name,

689
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:16,860
but we do know he went on an expedition
you funded to Darkest Peru.

690
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,246
Darkest Peru.

691
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:42,180
We've never been to Peru.

692
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:43,860
What? But you must have done.

693
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:47,860
I can see you're very busy.
Perhaps we could just go and check.

694
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:52,220
There are over two million letters,
diaries and artefacts up in our archive,

695
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:54,780
meticulously filed,
and they don't stay that way

696
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:58,260
by letting strange men
and their bears rummage around.

697
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:00,840
- Listen...
- I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

698
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:03,849
Come on then, Paddington.

699
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:07,161
Paddington?

700
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:09,561
Paddington?

701
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:13,380
- Paddington!
- Psst! Mr Brown? In here.

702
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:16,140
- What are you doing?
- We need to get into that archive.

703
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:20,060
Paddington,
please don't take this the wrong way,

704
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,940
but are you certain
there was an explorer?

705
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:26,567
You didn't just find a hat
and make up some...

706
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:31,490
What? Why are you looking at me
like that?

707
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,540
Is it me or is it hot in here?
Why do I feel so...

708
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,324
- Uncomfortable?
- Hmm.

709
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:38,660
- Flushed?
- Hmm.

710
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:40,420
- Queasy?
- Hmm.

711
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,140
It's called a hard stare.

712
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:45,460
My aunt taught me to do them
when people had forgotten their manners.

713
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:48,803
- Oh, give me strength.
- Mr Brown, you can trust me.

714
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:51,060
There really was an explorer.

715
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:53,860
And if we can find him,
I know he'll give me a home.

716
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:56,531
A proper home, like yours.

717
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:01,370
Now I've got an idea.
But I'm going to need your help.

718
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:13,540
- This is never going to work.
- Of course it will.

719
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:16,980
- You look very pretty.
- That's what they'll say in jail.

720
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:20,004
- Morning.
- Oh, hello there.

721
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:21,485
Hold up.

722
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:25,460
Haven't seen you before, have I?

723
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:29,201
No, that's right. I'm new.

724
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,567
Hmm... Thought so.

725
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:34,925
Lovely day, innit?

726
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,331
- Unusually hot.
- Yeah.

727
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,035
Just like you.

728
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:47,005
Go on, then. Off you pop.

729
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,081
Right!

730
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:02,362
Darkest Peru.

731
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:07,601
- 200 items!
- I knew that lady was hiding something.

732
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:18,020
What is it?

733
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:21,700
It says "record destroyed".
Let's check the others.

734
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,020
Oi!

735
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:24,884
New girl.

736
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:29,260
Is there a problem?

737
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:34,924
- Forgot to check your pass.
- My p... Oh, my pass. Yes.

738
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:39,369
Oh.

739
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,340
- It's an old photograph.
- Ha.

740
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,920
I'm sure you've always been a... Whoa.

741
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,980
O-O-2. Retrieve.

742
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,444
You've changed a bit.

743
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:04,728
I lost a lot of weight.

744
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:07,370
You're telling me.

745
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:09,963
And the...

746
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:14,126
I had it lasered.

747
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:21,760
And the arm's grown back.

748
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:26,011
It's a false arm.

749
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,921
You really can't feel a thing?

750
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:43,940
- Nothing.
- Amazing.

751
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:46,771
Well, I'm just off to the toilet.

752
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:49,165
See you in a bit.

753
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:55,980
Mr Brown, I've found something.

754
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:59,402
That's brilliant. Now let's put
these back and get out of here.

755
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:12,380
Er... Mr Brown...

756
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,460
Something's jamming the system.

757
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:22,420
I think it's a baguette.
Is that peanut butter?

758
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:24,860
Too orange. I think it's...

759
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,820
Marmalade.

760
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:31,840
Hey, you!

761
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:36,441
Stop that sexy woman!

762
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,371
Halt!

763
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:50,220
- You have a beautiful home, Mr Curry.
- I've lived here all my life.

764
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:54,500
I inherited it from my mother.
A very distant woman.

765
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:57,809
And being such a pillar
of the community, I can see why

766
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:01,447
having that beast move in next door
would upset you so.

767
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:05,820
I suppose I should be grateful
that it's only one bear.

768
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:08,980
Oh, but it always starts
with just one, Mr Curry.

769
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:12,540
Soon, the whole street
will be crawling with them.

770
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:14,780
Drains clogged with fur.

771
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,500
Buns thrown at old ladies.

772
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:19,968
Raucous all-night picnics.

773
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,940
- What can we do?
- I have certain connections.

774
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:27,700
If I can get hold of the bear, I can see
that he's sent where he belongs,

775
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:29,820
- no questions asked.
- Really?

776
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:35,260
But I can't do it alone. I need
a strong, capable man to help me.

777
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:37,806
Me? Oh, now...

778
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:40,500
if I start hanging around,
people will ask questions.

779
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:45,083
But you? You could keep an eye on him,
couldn't you? For me?

780
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:48,220
Of course.

781
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:52,609
Perfect. So you do that.
Soon as he's alone, we'll pounce.

782
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:56,700
Fire her up, Mr Gruber.

783
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:59,220
- You actually broke in?
- That's right.

784
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:00,860
Sounds incredibly brave.

785
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:04,940
There's a time for being boring and
annoying, and a time for being a man.

786
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,980
Mr Brown dressed up as a lady
and someone stuck pins in him.

787
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:09,300
- What?
- It's starting.

788
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:11,004
- What was that?
- Doesn't matter.

789
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:12,380
- In a dress?
- No!

790
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:13,686
Did look like a dress.

791
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:16,380
More of a housecoat.
Quite liberating, actually.

792
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:19,740
Darkest Peru.
A vast, unexplored wilderness,

793
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:22,764
shrouded in mystery. Until now!

794
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:24,900
Is that where you're from?

795
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,970
Oh, Paddington, it's incredible.

796
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:11,060
Goodbye, Lucy. Goodbye, Pastuzo.

797
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:15,940
And if you ever make it to London,
you can be sure of a very warm welcome.

798
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:18,100
I have learnt so much from these bears,

799
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:22,171
but I wonder what, if anything,
they have learnt from me.

800
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:27,042
Montgomery Clyde.

801
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:31,724
Dear Aunt Lucy. You'll never guess what.

802
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:36,860
Today I saw a film the explorer made
of Darkest Peru.

803
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:41,488
I do miss our old home, although I'm
beginning to understand life in London.

804
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:45,980
The Browns are a curious tribe,
but I rather like them.

805
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:48,606
The way Mr Brown
arranges his stationery.

806
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:52,020
The strange objects
Mrs Brown finds in her handbag.

807
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:53,940
There you are.

808
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:57,283
How Mrs Bird has a Hoover
for every occasion.

809
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:01,940
That Judy can master any language.
Even bear.

810
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:07,289
Wonderful pronunciation.

811
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:11,260
And how Jonathan
can build almost anything

812
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:13,681
using only Mr Brown's
educational old toys.

813
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:16,220
This is amazing!

814
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:19,660
It's very strange.
I may be about to find the explorer,

815
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:22,700
but I'm actually beginning
to feel at home here.

816
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:25,700
Paddington, these books
contain the names and addresses

817
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:27,500
of all the people who live in London.

818
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:30,300
If we look up every "M Clyde",
we'll find your explorer.

819
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,940
- Thank you, Mrs Brown.
- Let's get cracking.

820
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:35,020
Wait for me.
I'll see if I can find anything

821
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:36,820
about Captain Clyde in the library.

822
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:39,820
I'll come with you. I need to refresh
our marmalade supplies.

823
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:42,260
Shouldn't someone stay with Paddington?

824
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:44,060
It's only for a few hours.

825
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:47,562
You don't need to worry, Mr Brown.
I think I've got the hang of things.

826
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:50,010
Well, you take care.

827
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:52,380
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

828
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,642
Have you ever driven one of those?

829
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:02,523
Yes?

830
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,500
- Yes?
- Honeypot, this is Fierce Eagle.

831
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:08,540
- What?
- It's Mr Curry.

832
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:11,260
I did suggest that we adopt code names.

833
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:13,820
- Honeypot and Fierce Eagle.
- Yes, of course.

834
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:16,491
Do you actually have anything to report,
Fierce...?

835
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:17,940
- Eagle.
- ...Eagle?

836
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:19,060
Affirmative.

837
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:22,448
The Furry Menace is home alone.
I repeat,

838
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:25,140
the Furry Menace is home alone.

839
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:26,660
I'm on my way.

840
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:30,281
Honeypot.

841
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:33,088
- I need to get on the roof.
- Yes.

842
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:37,460
And after, I wondered if you'd like
to celebrate by dining with me.

843
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:39,940
I have some meat-paste sandwiches
and pickles.

844
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:42,180
- Sounds glorious.
- They went off on Tuesday

845
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:44,180
but you're normally alright for a week.

846
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:46,044
Mr Curry. The roof?

847
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:51,648
M Clyde, M Clyde...

848
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,766
Oh, dear.

849
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:00,365
I'm coming!

850
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,602
Come on, bear.

851
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:09,220
Just got a bit tied up
with the stationery.

852
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:11,084
Come on, little bear.

853
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:41,164
Elephant!

854
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:47,565
Bear!

855
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:50,866
Hide!

856
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:55,761
Darling! Darling! Honeypot, I'm coming!

857
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:39,900
Honeypot! Honeypot!

858
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:56,380
But it wasn't my fault.

859
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:58,620
Who else was in the house?
The door was locked.

860
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:00,540
- There was an elephant.
- An elephant?

861
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:04,020
It had the head of an elephant and body
of a snake, but it tried to shoot me!

862
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:06,088
- Have you been drinking salt water?
- No.

863
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:08,340
Paddington, tell us
what really happened.

864
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:09,965
- What?
- We won't be cross.

865
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:13,562
- Speak for yourself.
- Mrs Brown, you must believe me.

866
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:16,443
I would never lie to you.

867
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:19,340
I'm sorry, but that was the last straw.

868
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:20,980
It was an accident. They happen.

869
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:23,500
- But the children...
- Paddington's the best thing

870
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:26,220
that's ever happened to the children.
They're happy.

871
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:29,140
But what's the point of them being happy
if they're not safe?

872
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:30,620
He's putting them in danger.

873
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:32,660
They have to be our number-one priority.

874
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:34,410
They are!

875
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:38,005
They are.

876
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:44,962
And the worst part is
he won't even tell us the truth.

877
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:49,300
How can he live with us
if we can't even trust him?

878
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:51,220
I don't know, Henry.

879
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:53,243
We've got to face facts.

880
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:57,009
This house just isn't the place
for a bear.

881
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:00,249
Perhaps you're right.

882
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:03,651
Maybe we should take him
to the authorities.

883
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:42,884
Blow, wind, blow

884
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:46,860
Blow, wind, blow

885
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:52,967
I was never told the city of London
would be so cold

886
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:43,561
Thank you.

887
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,660
Get out of it!

888
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:55,250
Bloody bears!

889
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:58,921
I decide to roam

890
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:03,529
Now I wanted to go back home

891
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:10,940
"Dear Browns."

892
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:16,380
"Thank you very much for having me
to stay. You are a very lovely family."

893
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:20,087
"I'm very sorry
about the flood and the fire...

894
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:23,521
and the incident
at the Geographers' Guild."

895
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:26,847
"I hope that...

896
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:31,450
now I have gone,
things will calm down a bit."

897
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:36,043
"Yours, Paddington."

898
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:40,140
Well, shall we go after him?

899
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:42,402
It's better this way.

900
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:44,780
He didn't really belong here.

901
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:47,008
How can you say that?

902
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:50,420
Judy.

903
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:52,329
I'm going to my room.

904
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:56,247
- Where are you going?
- I just...

905
01:05:57,560 --> 01:05:59,210
I need to know he's OK.

906
01:06:06,470 --> 01:06:08,940
You just don't get it, do you?

907
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:10,140
What?

908
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:15,201
This family needed that wee bear
every bit as much as he needed you.

909
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:18,801
There. Said my piece.

910
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,220
Excuse me, I'm looking
for Montgomery Clyde.

911
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:44,900
I'm sorry, mate, I'm Morgan Clyde.

912
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,820
Thank you.

913
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:48,649
He's about three foot six.

914
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:52,886
He's got a bright red hat on
and a blue duffle coat.

915
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,084
And he's a bear.

916
01:06:57,320 --> 01:06:59,243
It's not much to go on.

917
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:01,500
Really?

918
01:07:02,353 --> 01:07:06,804
- Montgomery Clyde?
- I'm Marjorie Clyde, dearie.

919
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:27,563
Still no news.

920
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:30,500
In case you're interested.

921
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:32,204
Right.

922
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:58,220
- Who is it?
- Hello.

923
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:00,420
I'm looking for Montgomery Clyde.

924
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:02,700
- Never heard of him.
- But you must have done.

925
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:04,820
I've tried them all
and you're the last...

926
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:07,207
Why don't you clear off?

927
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:18,168
And if you ever make it to London,

928
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:21,260
you can be sure of a very warm welcome.

929
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:39,220
Please, please, please, please...

930
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:43,140
- Hello?
- Hello.

931
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:47,580
- I'm looking for Montgomery Clyde.
- Well, that's my father.

932
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:51,900
- The explorer Montgomery Clyde?
- That's right.

933
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,660
Come on in out of the cold.
I'll be right down.

934
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:57,969
Oh. Oh, thank you. Thank you!

935
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:01,580
Is Captain Clyde at home?

936
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:03,260
I'm afraid not.

937
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:06,204
You see, my father is dead.

938
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:09,531
Oh.

939
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:11,660
Oh, dear.

940
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:13,603
What did you want from him?

941
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:19,367
He once told my aunt that if ever
we came to London, we'd be welcome.

942
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:23,880
And I suppose I hoped
he might give me a home.

943
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:27,980
Oh, but I can do that.

944
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:30,811
- You can?
- Of course.

945
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:35,420
A lovely specimen like you
shouldn't be out on the streets.

946
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:38,808
You belong somewhere very special.

947
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:41,841
And I know just the place.

948
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:45,126
Come along.
We're going for a lovely ride.

949
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:47,970
Miss Clyde!

950
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:50,820
Mr Curry. What do you want?

951
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:54,300
I found these tied to a lamppost
and I thought waste not, want not.

952
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:57,449
Charming. Now, if you'll excuse me.

953
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:01,365
Erm... where exactly are you going?

954
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:04,128
What concern is it of yours?

955
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:08,180
- You've got the bear in there.
- And?

956
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:11,220
It's just, I thought you were
sending him to Peru. But...

957
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:13,900
I said I was sending him
where he belongs,

958
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,606
which in his case
is the Natural History Museum.

959
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:19,420
But, Honeypot, that is barbaric.

960
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:22,171
Mr Curry, I am not your Honeypot.
I never was.

961
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:23,460
What?

962
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:27,565
Now take your rotten flowers
and get out of here! Go.

963
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:30,251
Run!

964
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,809
- Hello?
- Good evening.

965
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:40,300
This is an anonymous phone call.

966
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:43,324
- Oh, hello, Mr Curry.
- It's not Mr Curry! It's Mr...

967
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:45,641
Burry.

968
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:47,780
I have some news

969
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:50,531
concerning the bear.

970
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:54,300
What? What do you mean?

971
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:57,020
- Who is it, Henry?
- It's Mr Curry doing a silly voice.

972
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:58,260
It's Burry!

973
01:10:58,360 --> 01:11:00,283
He says Paddington's been kidnapped!

974
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:27,060
Oh!

975
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:29,481
Welcome to your new home, bear.

976
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:33,220
This is a cathedral of knowledge.

977
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:35,940
Every major explorer
has added to its glory.

978
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:38,860
Charles Darwin brought
the giant tortoise from the Galapagos.

979
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:39,961
Good evening.

980
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:42,660
Captain Scott,
the emperor penguin from Antarctica.

981
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:44,250
- Gentlemen.
- Captain Cook,

982
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:46,380
- the kangaroo from Australia.
- G'day.

983
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:49,420
Each of these men has been immortalised
through his finds.

984
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:51,780
But do you see anything from my father?

985
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:53,245
No.

986
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:57,500
Because when he met
your oh-so-precious species,

987
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:59,841
he refused to collect a specimen.

988
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:02,460
No specimen?

989
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:05,860
Gentlemen, these were no dumb beasts.

990
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:07,940
They were intelligent and civilised.

991
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:10,566
Come off it, Clyde.
They didn't even speak English.

992
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:12,700
- Well, no, but...
- Did they play cricket?

993
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:15,140
- Drink tea?
- Do the crossword?

994
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:17,820
Pretty rum idea of civilisation
you've got, Clyde.

995
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:21,720
Tell us their location. We'll send
a real explorer to get a specimen.

996
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:25,244
Never!

997
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:27,460
Very well. You leave me no choice.

998
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:30,245
This expedition
shall be struck from the records.

999
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:32,940
Montgomery Clyde,

1000
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:37,260
I hereby revoke your membership
of this hallowed guild.

1001
01:12:37,660 --> 01:12:41,843
Geographers, turn your backs!

1002
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:46,660
He could have been rich and famous,

1003
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:51,243
but instead he threw it all away
and he opened a petting zoo.

1004
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:54,566
He put the happiness
of a few furry creatures

1005
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:56,620
above his own flesh and blood.

1006
01:12:56,720 --> 01:13:00,725
I vowed that one day I would finish
the job my father never could.

1007
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:06,283
And now, at last, that day has come.

1008
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:16,700
That's right!

1009
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:19,201
I'm going to stuff you, bear.

1010
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:47,500
I see him. And there's not
a moment to lose!

1011
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:50,580
How are we going to get in?
It'll be locked up like a fortress.

1012
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:54,260
Sewers. Didn't you say they could
take you anywhere in the city?

1013
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:55,600
Brilliant!

1014
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:20,700
You alright, love?

1015
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:23,167
Would you mind helping
a frail old woman?

1016
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:25,020
I've missed my bus.

1017
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:29,921
- Come on in. Come on out of the cold.
- Oh, thank you. You're so kind.

1018
01:14:40,746 --> 01:14:43,531
- It's locked from the other side.
- Leave it to me.

1019
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:46,420
What use is my old chemistry set?

1020
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:49,060
- Potassium nitrate, sulphur.
- Hmm?

1021
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:50,844
This stuff is lethal, Dad.

1022
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:56,088
Would you like a wee nip of antifreeze
for the old pacemaker?

1023
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:59,287
No, no, no. Not while I'm on duty.

1024
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:03,443
Oh. Too strong for you?

1025
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:08,803
Oh. Fighting talk. OK. I'll have one.

1026
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:12,606
Three, two, one.

1027
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:26,689
- Jonathan! That's 50,000 volts of...
- I know what I'm doing!

1028
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,081
Go for it!

1029
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:42,420
Go!

1030
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:48,660
No, best of three. I wasn't ready.
Come on.

1031
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:13,620
It's locked.

1032
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:16,166
- What do we do now?
- I know.

1033
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:22,167
- Henry! Henry, do not go out there!
- Do it, Dad.

1034
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,206
Someone has to.

1035
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:27,980
And that someone is me.

1036
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:29,730
Oh, I say!

1037
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:42,484
My hero.

1038
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:50,280
Crikey.

1039
01:16:58,280 --> 01:16:59,611
Whoa!

1040
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:02,608
Actually, this is insane.

1041
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:06,763
- Dad is property cool.
- He certainly is.

1042
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:19,647
I give up. I've gotta get back to work.

1043
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:22,760
Look, wait, wait, wait.

1044
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:26,770
Where's your fighting spirit?

1045
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:46,360
Henry!

1046
01:17:49,710 --> 01:17:50,768
Dad!

1047
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:57,460
Thank you.

1048
01:17:57,560 --> 01:17:58,860
He's alright.

1049
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:00,689
Good dog. Mwah!

1050
01:18:07,720 --> 01:18:09,131
Paddington!

1051
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:10,580
Paddington!

1052
01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:12,682
Up here!

1053
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:16,300
Is that you, God?

1054
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:17,660
What?

1055
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:20,684
It's just you sound a lot more
like Mr Brown than I imagined.

1056
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:22,540
It is Mr Brown.

1057
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:25,300
Mr Brown! What are you doing out there?

1058
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:26,980
We've come to rescue you!

1059
01:18:27,080 --> 01:18:28,411
You have?

1060
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:32,650
Mr Curry explained everything.
I'm so sorry I didn't believe you.

1061
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:39,208
Sabotage.

1062
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:45,767
Paddington, get out of there!

1063
01:18:58,680 --> 01:18:59,761
Bear!

1064
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:23,380
Give up, bear!

1065
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:26,260
Give up, bear!

1066
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,604
There's no way out.

1067
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:10,285
Henry!

1068
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:12,940
- Where's Paddington?
- I don't know.

1069
01:20:13,730 --> 01:20:15,740
I can hear something.

1070
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:20,140
- That's just the pipes.
- That's not pipes. That's bear.

1071
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:28,127
- He's going for the roof.
- Come on!

1072
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:40,765
Upstairs.

1073
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:19,161
- We've got you.
- Thank you.

1074
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:24,489
Come on, let's get out of here.

1075
01:21:25,240 --> 01:21:27,980
- Not so fast.
- No!

1076
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:30,731
Come on, hand over the bear.

1077
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:35,180
No. We won't do that.

1078
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:37,180
Mrs Brown?

1079
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:39,380
- He's family.
- Family?

1080
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:41,608
You're not even the same species.

1081
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:44,260
It's true.

1082
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:46,380
It is true.

1083
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:49,802
And when I first met Paddington,
I wanted nothing to do with him.

1084
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:54,660
But my wonderful wife,
she opened her heart to him

1085
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:57,260
and so did my incredible children.

1086
01:21:57,360 --> 01:21:59,340
- And now I have, too.
- Henry...

1087
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:02,603
it doesn't matter that he comes
from the other side of the world

1088
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:04,900
or that he's a different species

1089
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,651
or that he has
a worrying marmalade habit.

1090
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:11,740
We love Paddington.
And that makes him family!

1091
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:14,060
And families stick together!

1092
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:18,580
So if you want him,
you'll have to take us all!

1093
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:19,900
OK, then.

1094
01:22:20,855 --> 01:22:21,980
When I say "all"...

1095
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:25,540
- I've never stuffed a human, but...
- Wait.

1096
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:27,380
Wait.

1097
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:30,100
- You don't need to do that.
- Paddington!

1098
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:32,060
- No!
- Yes.

1099
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:34,322
That's right. Come, come.

1100
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:43,940
Erm, could I have one last request?

1101
01:22:45,089 --> 01:22:46,327
What is it?

1102
01:22:46,440 --> 01:22:49,250
I'd like a sandwich.
There's one in my hat.

1103
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:51,046
Go on, then.

1104
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:53,366
Thank you.

1105
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:08,340
Whoa!

1106
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:09,930
Who-o-oa!

1107
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:14,848
Nice try, bear!

1108
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,460
The crow's nest!

1109
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:22,060
Mrs Bird.

1110
01:23:22,160 --> 01:23:23,340
What?

1111
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:26,620
Hey, why didn't you look
where you were going?

1112
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:28,780
Shut your piehole.

1113
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:33,980
- Mrs Bird, you saved me.
- Oh!

1114
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:36,287
- Paddington!
- A bear.

1115
01:23:37,640 --> 01:23:40,900
Go easy. I have a dreadful headache.

1116
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:01,980
Hello?

1117
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:04,401
- Hi, Dad.
- Hello, Mr Brown.

1118
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:06,620
- Hello.
- What's going on?

1119
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:10,884
What a lovely surprise.
I didn't expect you home so early.

1120
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:15,780
- Something special's going on.
- More sugar.

1121
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:18,700
- Look at this. Hello, everyone.
- Hi, Dad.

1122
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:21,580
- Hi, big fella. What's cooking?
- Marmalade, Mr Brown.

1123
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:24,100
- Go on, have a taste.
- Delicious.

1124
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:26,965
Just one sandwich contains
all the vitamins and minerals

1125
01:24:27,080 --> 01:24:28,540
a bear needs for the whole day.

1126
01:24:28,640 --> 01:24:30,980
So does that mean
I don't have to eat vegetables?

1127
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:33,420
- He said "bear", not "boy".
- Sorry, Jonathan.

1128
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:35,100
- Thank you, Judy.
- Judy.

1129
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:38,820
Now, has anyone seen...
Thank you, Mrs Bird.

1130
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:41,100
I think every home
should have a marmalade day.

1131
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:43,931
- And a bear.
- Especially a bear.

1132
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:46,411
Home.

1133
01:24:49,480 --> 01:24:51,220
Dear Aunt Lucy.

1134
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:54,660
I'm sorry I haven't written sooner
but so much has been happening.

1135
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:56,780
I even met the explorer's daughter,

1136
01:24:56,880 --> 01:25:00,620
but she tried to stuff me,
so Mrs Bird threw her off a roof.

1137
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:01,820
Millicent Clyde...

1138
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:04,540
The judge didn't think
that prison would do her any good.

1139
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:06,780
So instead, he gave her
community service...

1140
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:09,380
No, please! Anything! Anything but that!

1141
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:11,084
...in the petting zoo.

1142
01:25:13,160 --> 01:25:17,051
- Get a move on, dung breath!
- It's not my breath!

1143
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:24,820
Back in Windsor Gardens,
life is very different.

1144
01:25:24,920 --> 01:25:27,860
Mrs Bird says it's because
things are finally set fair

1145
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:31,220
and it's had a tremendous effect
on her knees.

1146
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:35,180
Judy's embarrassment is clearing up
and she's even let Mrs Brown meet Tony.

1147
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:37,420
- You can't say anything.
- Of course not.

1148
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:40,171
- You can't touch me.
- I won't touch anyone, darling.

1149
01:25:40,280 --> 01:25:42,900
- And you're not gonna cry.
- No! No.

1150
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,500
There's just a lot going on
in my heart right now.

1151
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:47,967
We process things very differently,
you and I.

1152
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:49,730
- I know.
- Good.

1153
01:25:51,160 --> 01:25:52,980
Mum, this is Tony.

1154
01:25:53,080 --> 01:25:55,660
- Welcome to the family.
- Oh. Mum!

1155
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:58,650
Sorry. Sorry. Not crying.

1156
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:01,441
Henry?

1157
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:04,249
I'm sorry about her.

1158
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:08,043
She's weird. Er, but we all are.

1159
01:26:09,680 --> 01:26:12,100
Tea, anyone? No? No.

1160
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:15,820
And Mr Brown is helping Jonathan
build an enormous rocket.

1161
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:17,285
Are you sure about this, Dad?

1162
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:19,700
If we're gonna get
this bad boy into orbit,

1163
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:21,820
we're gonna need all the nitroglycerin.

1164
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:25,700
Although Jonathan worries about his
father's reckless attitude to safety.

1165
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:27,860
Houston, we may have a problem.

1166
01:26:27,960 --> 01:26:29,166
Duck!

1167
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:37,340
Mrs Brown says that in London,
everyone is different,

1168
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:40,523
but that means anyone can fit in.

1169
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:42,180
I think she must be right,

1170
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:46,490
because although I don't look like
anyone else, I really do feel at home.

1171
01:26:47,480 --> 01:26:51,180
I will never be like other people,
but that's alright.

1172
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:52,964
Because I am a bear.

1173
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:55,886
A bear called Paddington.

1174
01:26:56,520 --> 01:26:58,443
Come on, Paddington!

1175
01:26:59,640 --> 01:27:02,380
I had to laugh
till I couldn't laugh no more

1176
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:04,860
Like an old Chinaman out on the floor

1177
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:07,620
Pass me by, hopping like a clown

1178
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:10,340
I told meself
that he rarely go into town

1179
01:27:10,440 --> 01:27:12,920
And there was also a rajah gentleman

1180
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:15,660
Americans and British, West Indians

1181
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:18,604
Tell you one thing that really amused me

1182
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:20,940
Believe it or not was a pretty Japanese

1183
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:22,260
And they were singing

1184
01:27:22,360 --> 01:27:24,647
Ju-ba, ju-ba, a-ju-li-ba

1185
01:27:24,760 --> 01:27:27,060
They're jumping here
and they're jumping there

1186
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:29,860
With a boolah boolah boolah boolah
boolah boolah-ee

1187
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:31,980
The people going crazy

1188
01:27:45,720 --> 01:27:48,564
London is the place for me

1189
01:27:50,040 --> 01:27:53,408
London, that lovely city

1190
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:56,540
You could go to France or America

1191
01:27:56,640 --> 01:27:58,620
India, Asia or Australia

1192
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:02,247
You're gonna come back to London City

1193
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:10,491
London is the place for me

1194
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:15,208
Well, believe me,
I am speaking broad-mindedly

1195
01:28:16,280 --> 01:28:19,807
I am glad to know my mother country

1196
01:28:20,760 --> 01:28:23,060
I've been travelling
to countries years ago

1197
01:28:23,160 --> 01:28:25,620
But this is the place I want to know

1198
01:28:25,720 --> 01:28:28,769
London is the place for me

1199
01:28:34,520 --> 01:28:37,683
London is the place for me

1200
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:42,500
To live in London,
you are really comfortable

1201
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:47,060
Because the English people
are very much sociable

1202
01:28:47,160 --> 01:28:49,740
They will take you here
and they'll take you there

1203
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:52,060
And make you feel like a millionaire

1204
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:55,209
London is the place for me

1205
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:03,963
London is the place for me

1206
01:29:05,160 --> 01:29:08,607
At night, when you have nothing to do

1207
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:12,682
You can take a walk
down Shaftesbury Avenue

1208
01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:16,180
There you could laugh and talk
and enjoy the breeze

1209
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:18,620
Admire the beautiful sceneries

1210
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:21,769
London is the place for me

1211
01:29:27,560 --> 01:29:30,643
London is the place for me

1212
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:35,780
I cannot complain
of the time I have spent

1213
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:39,646
I mean, my life in London
is really magnificent

1214
01:29:40,640 --> 01:29:42,780
I have every comfort and every sport

1215
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:45,281
And my residence is at Hampton Court

1216
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:48,847
London is the place for me

1217
01:29:54,440 --> 01:29:57,284
London is the place for me

1218
01:31:03,640 --> 01:31:07,087
