1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:01:09,988 --> 00:01:11,739
Mama...?

3
00:01:19,914 --> 00:01:21,624
Mama?

4
00:01:24,961 --> 00:01:27,589
- Mama?
- Hi.

5
00:01:27,755 --> 00:01:30,300
Are you lost?
You wanna be best friends?

6
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,428
Fr... iend?

7
00:01:33,595 --> 00:01:37,140
- Friend?
- We'll start slow. What's your name?

8
00:01:40,435 --> 00:01:42,687
Wha-yer-name.

9
00:01:42,854 --> 00:01:44,897
No, no, no. What's your name?

10
00:01:45,064 --> 00:01:46,399
You-name!

11
00:01:47,025 --> 00:01:49,027
You-name? That's your name?

12
00:01:49,402 --> 00:01:50,903
You-name!

13
00:01:52,238 --> 00:01:53,906
Okaaay...

14
00:01:54,073 --> 00:01:56,534
I've got my work out out here.

15
00:02:00,455 --> 00:02:02,749
Come on, honeybun.

16
00:03:31,337 --> 00:03:35,466
YELLOWBIRD

17
00:04:00,283 --> 00:04:02,118
Look, it ain't complicated.

18
00:04:02,285 --> 00:04:05,705
You play nice,
or I'll bust your teeth

19
00:04:05,872 --> 00:04:08,541
until you look like pigeon puke.
I'll rip

20
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:11,544
your feathers off
till you cry to your mommy!

21
00:04:13,588 --> 00:04:14,380
Not bad!

22
00:04:14,547 --> 00:04:18,301
You had good volume, conviction.
But watch what you say.

23
00:04:18,468 --> 00:04:20,845
I'll bust your teeth? Look at me.

24
00:04:21,012 --> 00:04:24,390
Do I have teeth?
No, not one. Ahhhh! No teeth!

25
00:04:24,557 --> 00:04:26,100
I'll never get it right.

26
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:28,394
Hey, this is for your protection.

27
00:04:28,561 --> 00:04:30,938
I just don't feel comfortable, Bug.

28
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:36,110
Come on! You always say
you're scared of all the dangers!

29
00:04:36,277 --> 00:04:39,071
The rabid raccoons,
the killer hamsters...

30
00:04:39,238 --> 00:04:43,451
Yeah or gerbils with sharp teeth
or super violent

31
00:04:43,618 --> 00:04:45,411
bloodthirsty groundhogs.

32
00:04:46,412 --> 00:04:49,290
Hey, I've heard stories!

33
00:04:49,874 --> 00:04:52,668
I get it. You're terrified,
it's adorable.

34
00:04:52,835 --> 00:04:54,712
I'm trying to toughen you up!

35
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:57,715
Tough just isn't me, Bug.

36
00:04:57,882 --> 00:05:00,927
You say you want to get out
and see the world.

37
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:03,471
But you'll never go out that door!

38
00:05:04,722 --> 00:05:07,767
Look, I can't go right now.

39
00:05:07,934 --> 00:05:10,436
Besides, there's plenty to do here.

40
00:05:10,603 --> 00:05:12,814
What about a game of "Big Face"?

41
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:16,609
Biiiiiig face... little face!

42
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:18,778
Big face!

43
00:05:18,945 --> 00:05:20,404
Little face!

44
00:05:21,155 --> 00:05:23,908
Or maybe a little "Cardboard Roll"?

45
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:30,122
You're a bird, fella,

46
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:31,707
a bird.

47
00:05:31,874 --> 00:05:34,961
A bird flies,
it glides, it goes "ka-kawvvw"!

48
00:05:35,503 --> 00:05:37,630
You could see the whole world!

49
00:05:37,797 --> 00:05:39,632
The oceans, the mountains,

50
00:05:39,799 --> 00:05:42,051
the buffaloes!
The giant ostriches

51
00:05:42,218 --> 00:05:44,178
that wiggle their behinds like this!

52
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:46,848
The baboon-oceroses,

53
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:49,267
the orangu-possum!

54
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:03,656
It's really out there, you know.
Just like in the pictures.

55
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,617
Sure you don't want
to see it for real?

56
00:06:38,107 --> 00:06:39,859
Good morning, everyone.

57
00:06:40,026 --> 00:06:42,612
Come on, children, settle down now.

58
00:06:42,778 --> 00:06:45,531
Everyone on their branches!
Quickly, Anton.

59
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,744
Lisa, would you please hang up
the astronomy chart?

60
00:06:49,911 --> 00:06:51,829
Yes, miss!

61
00:06:52,705 --> 00:06:55,625
Just you wait,
I'll get called on again.

62
00:06:55,791 --> 00:07:00,254
If you'd learned the lesson,
you'd have nothing to worry about, Max.

63
00:07:00,421 --> 00:07:04,342
That's why you fail Night Sky Studies,
but get an "A" in Goofing Off.

64
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:07,970
Now try to remember.
Which planet lies to the East of Saturn?

65
00:07:08,763 --> 00:07:10,848
Miss Delf! Miss Delf!

66
00:07:11,015 --> 00:07:12,642
Um... Jupiturn?

67
00:07:12,808 --> 00:07:16,896
- Why not Plu-turn? Or Mercuturn?
- Shut your beak.

68
00:07:17,063 --> 00:07:20,149
- Who cares about the stars?
- If you don't memorize

69
00:07:20,316 --> 00:07:25,071
where the stars are at your age,
it'll be too late, you supercute

70
00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:28,991
doodooheads! Learn it, be confident.
The sky won't fall

71
00:07:29,158 --> 00:07:30,576
on your head, you know!

72
00:07:34,038 --> 00:07:36,624
It's only a leaf, kids! Don't panic.

73
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:40,670
What? I'm not panicking.
Who's panicking?

74
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:45,341
I know what it is. It's a leaf
from a Cyclobalanopsis Lithocarpus.

75
00:07:45,508 --> 00:07:47,843
You're a Litho-Crap-us!

76
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,595
"Carpus!"

77
00:07:49,762 --> 00:07:52,723
- How did it fall on you?
- From above.

78
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,600
- You didn't shake the branches?
- No.

79
00:07:54,767 --> 00:07:59,772
Nobody pulled on it? Shook it?
Tickled it? Wiggled it? Hopped around?

80
00:08:02,483 --> 00:08:05,528
OK, lesson's over for today, kids.

81
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:08,823
Wow, thank you, Leaf!

82
00:08:28,092 --> 00:08:29,427
Dad?

83
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:36,434
Already? Nobody pulled on it?

84
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,354
Shook it? Tickled it?
Wiggled it? Hopped around?

85
00:08:42,398 --> 00:08:45,109
That settles it.
Autumn's on its way.

86
00:08:45,276 --> 00:08:47,987
Yes! We're going to Africa!
Awesome!

87
00:08:48,154 --> 00:08:49,947
Let's go tell the others!

88
00:08:52,283 --> 00:08:53,659
Where is Africa?

89
00:08:55,703 --> 00:08:57,788
And... where are we?

90
00:08:59,582 --> 00:09:01,500
Wow, hold on...

91
00:09:02,084 --> 00:09:05,212
Couldn't we go someplace...
I don't know...

92
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:07,590
A little closer?

93
00:09:07,757 --> 00:09:10,259
Off to Africa! Time to fly!

94
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:17,224
Come on, little bro!
You can practice during the trip.

95
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:25,983
Janet! It's autumn! We're outta here!

96
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,818
Oh, already?

97
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:30,696
Michka! Get a move on. We're leaving!

98
00:09:30,863 --> 00:09:34,492
What? So soon?
But we're not ready yet!

99
00:09:36,202 --> 00:09:41,707
Anton, I'm sick of tidying up your toys!
Finish molting and stop clowning around!

100
00:09:41,874 --> 00:09:46,087
I gotta molt,
I can't wear this color for autumn!

101
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,006
Mom, Anton's annoying me.

102
00:09:59,809 --> 00:10:03,646
Darius! So we're leaving?
Why am I the last to know?

103
00:10:03,813 --> 00:10:08,484
I'm next in line, your
second-in-command, wing-man, back-up.

104
00:10:08,651 --> 00:10:11,237
I should be the first to know!

105
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:13,072
Well now, Karl,

106
00:10:13,239 --> 00:10:16,283
you're always saying
you've got a 6th sense!

107
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,577
I thought you knew already.

108
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:21,705
OK, OK! That's very funny.

109
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:24,792
"You're always saying
you've got a 6th sense"!

110
00:10:28,254 --> 00:10:29,505
Daddy?

111
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:31,632
Everything OK?

112
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:35,970
- What? Oh, sure.
- Are you worried about the iron birds?

113
00:10:36,137 --> 00:10:40,057
Sometimes I feel
that the seasons are all out of kilter.

114
00:10:40,224 --> 00:10:43,936
But I'm sure
that's just my old bird brain!

115
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,313
But don't you worry,

116
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,317
it's going to be a wonderful trip,
just like every year.

117
00:11:12,548 --> 00:11:14,216
Score!

118
00:11:15,134 --> 00:11:18,470
Everybody goes crazy!

119
00:11:23,184 --> 00:11:24,226
OK!

120
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,437
Come on!

121
00:11:26,604 --> 00:11:28,397
My shot.

122
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:32,610
Oh no!

123
00:11:35,738 --> 00:11:37,948
Oh, sorry, honeybun!

124
00:11:38,115 --> 00:11:41,744
I didn't mean to hit it so far.
Now you'll have to get it.

125
00:11:41,911 --> 00:11:43,662
It's no big deal...

126
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:46,165
- Ow, ow...
- What's the matter?

127
00:11:46,332 --> 00:11:49,335
Boy, does that hurt!
I sprained a mandible

128
00:11:49,835 --> 00:11:51,962
or twisted an antenna...

129
00:11:52,963 --> 00:11:55,049
Legs... paralyzed!

130
00:11:55,216 --> 00:11:57,343
Oh, you've gotta get that acorn!

131
00:11:57,509 --> 00:12:01,222
But... you shot it really far out there.

132
00:12:01,764 --> 00:12:04,475
You! Valiant friend! Don't abandon us.

133
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:06,227
You're our only hope.

134
00:12:07,186 --> 00:12:09,063
We can play with something else.

135
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:11,690
Never! It came
from my great-grandmother!

136
00:12:11,857 --> 00:12:14,526
Didn't you say
you found it in the forest?

137
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:18,822
It's been in the family for generations!
Please, honeybunny!

138
00:12:18,989 --> 00:12:20,699
I'm begging you!

139
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:24,245
Oh, the pain!

140
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:28,499
OK! I'll do it.
Just stop calling me bunny, OK?

141
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:51,397
I'm only doing this
because we're best friends.

142
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:55,442
Good.

143
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:25,097
Darius...

144
00:13:25,264 --> 00:13:29,184
- Will we really fly across the sea?
- Absolutely!

145
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,186
And the desert too?

146
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:34,231
Yes, Lisa. And the desert too.

147
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:39,862
Now go and get plenty to eat.
To stock up for the long journey.

148
00:13:40,029 --> 00:13:41,280
This is the one time

149
00:13:41,447 --> 00:13:44,950
I'll let you stuff yourselves.
Go on.

150
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:46,827
Sounds good to me!

151
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:52,708
Oh yes...

152
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,671
Once we get there, we'll find
a separate bush for the two of you.

153
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:01,091
Young lovebirds need their privacy.

154
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:02,676
- We're not...
- Dad!

155
00:14:03,302 --> 00:14:08,182
What are you saying? Did you eat a bad
blueberry? Willy and I aren't together.

156
00:14:08,349 --> 00:14:10,893
You kids must be as blind as bats!

157
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:14,605
Only you haven't noticed
you're made for each other.

158
00:14:14,772 --> 00:14:17,566
It's as plain as the beak on my face!

159
00:14:17,733 --> 00:14:18,984
Dad!

160
00:14:19,193 --> 00:14:20,444
Oops...

161
00:14:27,785 --> 00:14:29,953
I'll be back shortly, lovebirds.

162
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,623
Get everything ready for our departure.

163
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,833
I'm counting on you.

164
00:16:49,718 --> 00:16:52,054
One foot in front of the other.

165
00:16:52,221 --> 00:16:55,766
Keep walking... get the acorn...
What is that?

166
00:16:55,933 --> 00:16:58,477
A radioactive mutant coyote!

167
00:16:58,644 --> 00:16:59,978
No, just branches.

168
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:04,149
OK, let's not panic.
There is nothing dangerous out here,

169
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:06,318
just trees.

170
00:17:06,652 --> 00:17:11,448
Just big,
twisty black trees with claws!

171
00:17:11,615 --> 00:17:13,867
Right! Focus!

172
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:17,704
No acorn left behind!
Get that little soldier.

173
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:19,206
Hey, little guy!

174
00:17:19,373 --> 00:17:21,959
We're gonna get you out of here.

175
00:17:23,335 --> 00:17:25,212
What was I scared of?

176
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:30,217
Red alert! Abandon acorn!

177
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,770
Please... Somebody...

178
00:17:41,937 --> 00:17:43,272
Help!

179
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:46,942
- That's just what I was gonna say.
- Help me!

180
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:50,445
Help you? Help me!

181
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:54,241
Please, somebody! Please help!

182
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:59,496
I can't, sorry!
I... I got some dust in my eye!

183
00:17:59,663 --> 00:18:02,708
- I'm allergic to pollen!
- Are you still there?

184
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,209
No!

185
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:07,754
OK, I am, but listen... I'm uh...

186
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,841
. I-m gonna go get help!
- DON'T go!

187
00:18:11,008 --> 00:18:12,843
I'm begging you! Hurry!

188
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:15,220
OK, but let's do this quick

189
00:18:15,387 --> 00:18:17,598
and you better not be bleeding!

190
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:19,391
I cannot stand blood!

191
00:18:38,744 --> 00:18:39,995
Sir?

192
00:18:41,872 --> 00:18:44,124
Well, you don't look so good...

193
00:18:46,168 --> 00:18:49,171
You gotta help me, little fella...

194
00:18:49,338 --> 00:18:53,216
- I don't have much time left.
- OK, but we can't stay here.

195
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:56,678
My family has to leave
before winter comes.

196
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,806
It's a matter of life and death!

197
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,976
We'll get you home
and you'll be just fine!

198
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:04,269
Man, you're heavy!

199
00:19:05,187 --> 00:19:08,690
If my children don't leave
for Africa right away,

200
00:19:08,857 --> 00:19:10,442
they'll all die!

201
00:19:10,609 --> 00:19:15,822
You want me to help? We just met
and I'm not exactly the hero type.

202
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:19,576
You've got to go find Karl, my nephew!

203
00:19:20,118 --> 00:19:22,871
He's the only one
who can get them to Africa.

204
00:19:23,497 --> 00:19:24,790
Africa?

205
00:19:25,707 --> 00:19:30,045
Karl. If I'm still alive
in 10 minutes, I'll tell him.

206
00:19:30,212 --> 00:19:32,881
- How much do you weigh?
- He must change

207
00:19:33,048 --> 00:19:38,804
the usual route to avoid the iron birds!
They're all over our route this year.

208
00:19:39,471 --> 00:19:41,890
Just a suggestion: Give up carbs.

209
00:19:42,057 --> 00:19:43,392
The iron birds,

210
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:45,977
promise me you'll tell Karl!

211
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:47,145
Yeah, sure.

212
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:48,897
Promise me!

213
00:19:49,064 --> 00:19:51,775
- I promise.
- He's got to go the way

214
00:19:51,942 --> 00:19:55,195
of the pointed rocks,
then the river with the fireflies,

215
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:58,448
then change directions till the sea.

216
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:01,076
Karl's got a 6th sense...

217
00:20:01,243 --> 00:20:04,746
if he can just learn
to hear it, to follow it.

218
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:07,165
This is a lot of information.

219
00:20:07,332 --> 00:20:09,543
Can you repeat the first part?

220
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,753
You must tell them!

221
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,463
OK, OK! "Karl," "pointed rocks,"

222
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:17,884
"fireflies," "6th sense," I got it.
Now let's get out of here!

223
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:27,060
Daddy!

224
00:20:27,811 --> 00:20:29,271
Daddy! Where are you?

225
00:20:29,438 --> 00:20:34,359
Something's wrong. He was only supposed
to be gone for a couple of minutes.

226
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:37,612
Over here!

227
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:40,407
No! Daddy!

228
00:20:48,832 --> 00:20:50,041
Daddy?

229
00:20:57,632 --> 00:20:58,884
Daddy...

230
00:20:59,843 --> 00:21:03,889
Listen to the yellow bird...

231
00:21:04,055 --> 00:21:05,432
What?

232
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:08,894
- Yellow... bird...
- Daddy?

233
00:21:12,606 --> 00:21:14,065
No!

234
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:17,778
Daddy...

235
00:22:03,448 --> 00:22:04,533
Hey! You!

236
00:22:05,075 --> 00:22:06,493
Wait!

237
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:09,204
Who are you? What were you doing here?

238
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:11,039
I... I...

239
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:14,626
I'm sorry.

240
00:22:14,793 --> 00:22:16,378
Karl, what do we do?

241
00:22:17,087 --> 00:22:18,505
Karl?

242
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:21,508
Are you Karl?

243
00:22:21,675 --> 00:22:24,803
- Ladybug?
- Are you going to Africa

244
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:25,804
for the winter?

245
00:22:25,971 --> 00:22:28,849
Yes. But without Darius...

246
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:31,768
Without Darius?
You're gonna need him!

247
00:22:31,935 --> 00:22:36,481
What? Need him? For what?
Need him for what?

248
00:22:36,648 --> 00:22:40,402
- To get you to Africa!
- OK, OK!

249
00:22:40,569 --> 00:22:43,363
Listen, buggy,
we're a pretty tight group.

250
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:48,326
We've been through a lot without
dragging along a skinny yellow bird.

251
00:22:48,952 --> 00:22:51,162
Wait a minute. "Yellow bird?"

252
00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:53,665
Pay no attention to the ladybug.

253
00:22:53,832 --> 00:22:55,834
She lives alone, she's crazy.

254
00:22:56,001 --> 00:23:00,213
It's true. This guy is
the only one who knows the new route.

255
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,257
The new route?

256
00:23:02,424 --> 00:23:06,344
You can't take last year's route
because of the iron birds.

257
00:23:06,511 --> 00:23:08,889
Only he knows how to avoid them!

258
00:23:09,347 --> 00:23:12,309
- Iron birds?!
- This is insane.

259
00:23:12,475 --> 00:23:15,604
We are listening to a raving insect!

260
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:19,524
- Did you speak to my father?
- Yes. I tried to help him.

261
00:23:19,691 --> 00:23:22,277
It was your father's final wish.

262
00:23:22,903 --> 00:23:25,322
Could you excuse us for a moment?

263
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:29,826
Are you crazy?
Karl is supposed to lead them.

264
00:23:29,993 --> 00:23:31,953
Not if only you know the way.

265
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,580
I don't know the way!

266
00:23:33,747 --> 00:23:37,417
Sure you do!
Just follow the old man's clues.

267
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:39,794
Pointed rocks, fireflies...
It's easy.

268
00:23:39,961 --> 00:23:42,756
You have as much instinct
as any other bird.

269
00:23:42,923 --> 00:23:45,675
You left the house. Just keep going!

270
00:23:45,842 --> 00:23:47,761
Just... keep on... going?

271
00:23:47,928 --> 00:23:51,723
It's your chance, honeybun,
to be a part of a real flock.

272
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:53,850
You'll never be alone out there.

273
00:23:54,017 --> 00:23:55,852
But what about you?

274
00:23:56,019 --> 00:23:57,979
I can't leave you behind.

275
00:23:58,146 --> 00:24:02,525
This has all been very weird.
So, if you can give me the new route,

276
00:24:02,692 --> 00:24:04,527
we'll get out of here.

277
00:24:04,945 --> 00:24:07,072
Darius told me the way.

278
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:08,490
Yes!

279
00:24:08,657 --> 00:24:12,035
And he made me promise

280
00:24:12,202 --> 00:24:13,578
to take you there.

281
00:24:13,745 --> 00:24:16,539
Impossible. I'm the next in line.

282
00:24:16,706 --> 00:24:18,708
A promise is a promise.

283
00:24:24,172 --> 00:24:25,382
Come on quick!

284
00:24:25,548 --> 00:24:27,008
Let's fly!

285
00:24:44,526 --> 00:24:46,653
Oh no! Help!

286
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:49,698
- Fleck!
- Willy!

287
00:25:03,044 --> 00:25:04,421
No, that way!

288
00:25:12,929 --> 00:25:14,389
Fleck!

289
00:25:17,934 --> 00:25:20,520
Hey you! Wait for us!

290
00:25:21,062 --> 00:25:22,897
Fleck, you're alright?

291
00:25:23,064 --> 00:25:26,526
Thanks, buddy. You saved his life.

292
00:25:26,943 --> 00:25:29,988
Hi! I'm Willy,
the worried older brother.

293
00:25:30,155 --> 00:25:32,991
My father placed us
under your wing.

294
00:25:33,158 --> 00:25:35,035
So, which way do we go now?

295
00:25:35,577 --> 00:25:37,996
Let's all just calm down here!

296
00:25:38,163 --> 00:25:41,082
Don't listen to a stranger.
Why change...

297
00:25:41,249 --> 00:25:45,003
Karl, don't forget Dad's last words:
"Listen to the yellow bird".

298
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:49,674
Right! Darius says "yellow bird".
<i>2</i> minutes later, a yellow bird shows up!

299
00:25:49,841 --> 00:25:51,426
This is nonsense!

300
00:25:51,593 --> 00:25:53,970
Darius talked to you?
What did he say?

301
00:25:54,304 --> 00:25:56,931
Well, he made me promise

302
00:25:57,098 --> 00:26:00,018
to take you to Africa.
- He said that?

303
00:26:00,185 --> 00:26:02,437
Yeah, he did. Crazy, right?

304
00:26:02,604 --> 00:26:05,148
Because I've got a 6th sense.

305
00:26:05,315 --> 00:26:11,279
A 6th sense?! Ridiculous!
I'm the only one with a 6th sense.

306
00:26:11,446 --> 00:26:12,989
The pointed rocks!

307
00:26:13,156 --> 00:26:15,533
The pointed rocks! It's this way!

308
00:26:16,117 --> 00:26:18,578
Apparently you're not the only one!

309
00:26:19,788 --> 00:26:22,916
Hold on!
The stars aren't even lined up!

310
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:25,710
That's bad luck!
We're against the wind!

311
00:26:25,877 --> 00:26:29,255
And why isn't anyone listening to me?

312
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:34,594
Amazing!

313
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:39,599
It's the pointed rocks,
just like he said! Wow!

314
00:26:48,483 --> 00:26:51,820
Something is telling me
we have to find...

315
00:26:51,986 --> 00:26:54,781
a river with fireflies.

316
00:26:54,948 --> 00:26:57,826
- Yep, I'm getting a vibe.
- A vibe?

317
00:26:58,243 --> 00:27:01,538
I'm getting a vibe myself.
A different vibe.

318
00:27:03,665 --> 00:27:05,041
Go on!

319
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:10,004
Fly away, honeybun.
I did it. I'm so proud.

320
00:27:10,672 --> 00:27:13,216
Wait... Who'll be my best friend now?

321
00:28:14,569 --> 00:28:18,239
May the migration go smoothly,
may the wind be at our backs,

322
00:28:18,406 --> 00:28:23,161
may the sun shine, not too warm,
keep the northerly breeze not too cold.

323
00:28:23,328 --> 00:28:26,873
If you set the temperature
at 65 degrees, that'd be nice.

324
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:31,085
Hey, Maggie, are you praying
or giving us the weather forecast?

325
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:03,743
Let's see,
river with the fireflies...

326
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:06,454
River with the fireflies...

327
00:29:06,621 --> 00:29:08,873
This is crazy. Crazy, right?

328
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:12,085
We should just take last year's route,

329
00:29:12,252 --> 00:29:14,796
which is in the opposite direction!

330
00:29:14,963 --> 00:29:17,173
And come across the iron birds?

331
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:22,178
Get torn to shreds? Cut into pieces
with flesh like confetti...

332
00:29:22,762 --> 00:29:24,806
We get the message, Janet.

333
00:29:24,973 --> 00:29:28,434
Do you think
these iron birds really exist?

334
00:29:28,601 --> 00:29:29,602
Well, of course.

335
00:29:29,769 --> 00:29:35,066
Thank Birdness, you popped up with
the plan to avoid them, eh, mastermind?

336
00:29:36,651 --> 00:29:39,529
Oh, "mastermind",
that's such a strong word.

337
00:29:39,696 --> 00:29:44,409
Well, if Darius picked you...
Where you fly, we follow.

338
00:29:44,575 --> 00:29:46,119
Well, yes, ma'am.

339
00:29:46,286 --> 00:29:50,790
You can call me Janet!
I'm the mother of that stubborn Karl.

340
00:29:51,624 --> 00:29:55,169
I'm also Delf's aunt
and I'm married to this one.

341
00:29:55,336 --> 00:29:58,006
Michka. Delighted.
What's your name?

342
00:29:58,381 --> 00:30:02,176
Well, uh, Ladybug calls me honeybun.

343
00:30:02,343 --> 00:30:04,512
Honeybun? No, your real name?

344
00:30:04,846 --> 00:30:07,098
Well, I don't really have one.

345
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:09,809
That's it! Fireflies!

346
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:13,771
It really is a river of fireflies.

347
00:30:14,188 --> 00:30:16,858
- Hey look.
- See?

348
00:30:17,025 --> 00:30:19,110
He does know the way!

349
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:22,405
You know, I wanted to thank you,
leaving your house

350
00:30:22,572 --> 00:30:25,325
and friends behind for us.
It's very brave.

351
00:30:25,825 --> 00:30:29,120
- Brave? Me? Oh, well...
- Yes, you are.

352
00:30:29,287 --> 00:30:33,082
For a little bird, a non-migrator,
this is a big journey.

353
00:30:33,249 --> 00:30:35,960
You got that right.
Africa is, what...

354
00:30:36,377 --> 00:30:38,921
at least 3 or 4 hours from here.

355
00:30:39,088 --> 00:30:41,424
You're funny! And a real optimist!

356
00:30:41,591 --> 00:30:44,886
You need to be,
when you think about all the dangers.

357
00:30:45,053 --> 00:30:49,265
Right, right. All those dangers
just waiting, huh?

358
00:30:49,432 --> 00:30:51,392
Dangerously lurking.

359
00:30:51,976 --> 00:30:56,022
Ha! Hilarious...
Maybe we should take a pit stop.

360
00:30:56,189 --> 00:31:00,151
A little break sounds good.
Gotta think of the old-timers!

361
00:31:00,318 --> 00:31:02,612
My wings don't flap as well now!

362
00:31:02,779 --> 00:31:05,156
And I'm getting a little hungry.

363
00:31:06,074 --> 00:31:08,034
You're not a little anything!

364
00:31:09,452 --> 00:31:12,413
Doesn't it look
like the South of France?

365
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:17,168
It's probably the south South of France.
Or even already Spain.

366
00:31:21,255 --> 00:31:23,966
Why did we stop here?
It's the pits.

367
00:31:24,133 --> 00:31:27,470
- And it stinks.
- Maybe it's an "arm" pit!

368
00:31:27,637 --> 00:31:30,431
Miss Delf said
to stop in the city,

369
00:31:30,598 --> 00:31:34,894
'cause it's warmer here.
It's a great thing called pollution.

370
00:31:35,061 --> 00:31:37,688
- Right, Miss Delf?
- Correct, Lisa.

371
00:31:38,064 --> 00:31:40,233
She said that's correct!

372
00:31:41,442 --> 00:31:42,568
Hey, look!

373
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,446
Free food!

374
00:31:48,449 --> 00:31:50,910
Hey, guys, can I ask you...

375
00:31:55,456 --> 00:31:57,208
- Excuse me...
- Beat it!

376
00:31:58,209 --> 00:32:01,129
- Move it, shorty.
- Find another corner!

377
00:32:01,295 --> 00:32:02,630
Take off, Twiggy-

378
00:32:03,131 --> 00:32:06,300
I just want to know
which way to get to Africa!

379
00:32:14,642 --> 00:32:15,935
Help!

380
00:32:27,488 --> 00:32:30,616
For a little fella,
he sure got some bounce!

381
00:32:30,783 --> 00:32:34,704
We're being led by a moron!

382
00:32:46,132 --> 00:32:47,842
That hurt!

383
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:09,947
Help!

384
00:33:10,114 --> 00:33:14,452
Delf! Janet!
It's too dark! I've got dark-aphobia!

385
00:33:14,619 --> 00:33:15,912
What're you doing?

386
00:33:16,078 --> 00:33:19,415
Sorry, I was just in there
inspecting the...

387
00:33:20,541 --> 00:33:23,836
Forget it.
Let's get outta here. This place stinks.

388
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:27,298
Well yes, we were waiting for you.

389
00:33:27,465 --> 00:33:30,843
We need to pull everybody together.
This detour thing is...

390
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:33,638
Well, Karl is nervous about it.

391
00:33:33,804 --> 00:33:36,974
Listen, I don't think
this is gonna work out.

392
00:33:37,141 --> 00:33:40,436
It's too dangerous. I gotta go home,
lots of housework.

393
00:33:40,603 --> 00:33:42,563
- I've got a bug to feed.
- What?

394
00:33:43,231 --> 00:33:45,441
Here's what I'm thinking:

395
00:33:45,608 --> 00:33:48,236
Do we really need
to go to "Africa" Africa?

396
00:33:48,402 --> 00:33:49,403
What?

397
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:54,742
There's gotta be a ton of nice places
that are a lot closer than Africa.

398
00:33:55,284 --> 00:33:58,329
Places very "Africa-like", you know?

399
00:34:00,248 --> 00:34:04,293
OK. I get it.
I knew it was too good to be true.

400
00:34:04,669 --> 00:34:07,421
Why'd you help us out,
save an entire family,

401
00:34:07,588 --> 00:34:10,258
just 'cause of a promise
to a dying bird?

402
00:34:10,424 --> 00:34:14,011
No big deal. We'll go
our separate ways, we'll be fine.

403
00:34:14,428 --> 00:34:16,973
I'm sure you will. Fantastic!

404
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:19,976
Bye. Lovely. Really. Bon voyage!

405
00:34:20,142 --> 00:34:25,022
We'll survive
for 6, maybe 7 days on our own.

406
00:34:25,189 --> 00:34:28,734
Don't worry about it.
We'll just make them count.

407
00:34:28,901 --> 00:34:30,695
Nah, well, it's just

408
00:34:30,861 --> 00:34:34,657
it's a lot farther than I thought.
I'm not built for this.

409
00:34:34,824 --> 00:34:38,327
I'm sure Karl will be
very happy to take over.

410
00:34:38,494 --> 00:34:42,081
Stop making excuses!
If my father wanted Karl to lead us,

411
00:34:42,248 --> 00:34:47,295
he would have said so. But he asked you.
He must've had a good reason.

412
00:34:49,255 --> 00:34:52,758
I really can't think of one.
Plus, he didn't really...

413
00:34:52,925 --> 00:34:55,886
My dad was never wrong, never.

414
00:34:56,053 --> 00:34:59,348
Maybe he saw
you had a good heart,

415
00:34:59,515 --> 00:35:01,892
you wouldn't leave us in the lurch.

416
00:35:02,727 --> 00:35:04,895
And you had a 6th sense.

417
00:35:05,062 --> 00:35:09,025
He had like a "6th sense" sense?
Like a 7th sense?

418
00:35:09,442 --> 00:35:11,736
You are a bit weird, it's true.

419
00:35:11,902 --> 00:35:14,030
But my father could spot potential.

420
00:35:14,405 --> 00:35:17,366
He saw right away
you were something special.

421
00:35:19,452 --> 00:35:24,123
I've finished my speech. You're supposed
to say: "Yes, Delf, you're right",

422
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:27,043
I had my doubts,
but you turned me around."

423
00:35:27,209 --> 00:35:29,253
Sorry, my 6th sense must be off.

424
00:35:30,296 --> 00:35:32,131
<i>Pull yourself together, honeybun!</i>

425
00:35:32,632 --> 00:35:33,841
You, here?

426
00:35:34,216 --> 00:35:36,844
Trying to convince you
to lead our migration.

427
00:35:37,178 --> 00:35:39,847
- I'm not really here.
- Not here?

428
00:35:40,139 --> 00:35:42,850
Yeah, you do seem a little absent.

429
00:35:43,017 --> 00:35:45,353
Maybe that knock on your head...

430
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:49,857
- So, you hear <i>what I</i> say?
- Maybe she's right about the knock.

431
00:35:50,024 --> 00:35:54,028
<i>I'll tell you another thing:
You can't leave them in the lurch!</i>

432
00:35:54,195 --> 00:35:55,905
I can't? That's right!

433
00:35:56,072 --> 00:35:57,198
Sorry?

434
00:35:57,365 --> 00:36:00,117
I mean,
I can't leave you all in the lurch.

435
00:36:00,284 --> 00:36:01,869
That's what I think.

436
00:36:02,745 --> 00:36:04,914
<i>It's time to take charge.</i>

437
00:36:05,081 --> 00:36:06,791
- Time to take charge.
- Really?

438
00:36:06,957 --> 00:36:10,127
- <i>Follow your instincts.</i>
- I'll <i>follow</i> my <i>instincts.</i>

439
00:36:10,294 --> 00:36:13,172
<i>- Besides, she's cute.</i>
- <i>You're</i> cute.

440
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:15,091
Excuse me?

441
00:36:15,257 --> 00:36:18,219
Sorry!
That was my 6th sense talking!

442
00:36:18,386 --> 00:36:20,096
Yeah, it's working now.

443
00:36:20,262 --> 00:36:23,474
- So, you'll keep going?
- Yeah, OK!

444
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:25,893
I can sense what's ahead!

445
00:36:26,936 --> 00:36:29,105
Wow, amazing!

446
00:36:29,772 --> 00:36:33,067
You are acting a little weird
but amazing!

447
00:36:33,234 --> 00:36:34,527
Let's go!

448
00:36:40,157 --> 00:36:43,285
Fall in line, campers!
The sun is rising.

449
00:36:43,452 --> 00:36:45,871
We've got an Africa to get to!

450
00:36:46,038 --> 00:36:50,543
I am not moving.
You can all take off to your doom.

451
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:53,587
Just go without me.
Bon voyage, have fun.

452
00:36:54,088 --> 00:36:56,048
OK. See you next year!

453
00:36:56,215 --> 00:36:58,384
You would take off without me?

454
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,554
Who does that?!

455
00:37:15,317 --> 00:37:17,778
Hey little bro! Ready to fly?

456
00:37:20,281 --> 00:37:22,450
Yah-hoo!

457
00:37:23,451 --> 00:37:24,869
Fleck!

458
00:37:26,537 --> 00:37:27,621
Thanks, pal!

459
00:37:27,997 --> 00:37:29,540
Sorry about that.

460
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,584
No problem.

461
00:37:32,418 --> 00:37:35,504
I love kids. Just not for breakfast.

462
00:37:35,671 --> 00:37:38,257
You have to put on
some weight, bro.

463
00:37:38,424 --> 00:37:41,385
Catch a strong breeze,
you'll wind up in China!

464
00:37:41,552 --> 00:37:46,015
Don't sweat it. Your wings
will grow soon! So will your voice.

465
00:37:46,182 --> 00:37:50,853
You think so? 'Cause I gotta say,
I've really had it with this voice!

466
00:38:11,373 --> 00:38:15,920
Hey kid, why are all the others going
in the opposite direction?

467
00:38:16,086 --> 00:38:20,925
That's weird. They probably don't have
all the latest info, like myself.

468
00:38:21,091 --> 00:38:24,053
I should let them know.
I'll be right back.

469
00:38:28,766 --> 00:38:32,520
Hey, guys! Excuse me.
I'm in a bit of a jam here.

470
00:38:32,686 --> 00:38:35,147
Funny story:
I got some kooky directions.

471
00:38:35,314 --> 00:38:38,734
You wouldn't happen to know
which way is Africa?

472
00:38:38,901 --> 00:38:43,864
And how about South? You know
which way is South? Oh, forget it!

473
00:38:44,031 --> 00:38:47,326
I don't know
what my 6th sense is telling me.

474
00:38:47,493 --> 00:38:50,287
My other 5 senses
have gotten us lost.

475
00:38:50,454 --> 00:38:53,541
<i>Trust yourself. You'll find a path...</i>

476
00:38:53,707 --> 00:38:56,836
Really? You got me into this mess,

477
00:38:57,002 --> 00:38:59,922
you get me out!
You tell me the path.

478
00:39:00,089 --> 00:39:05,135
<i>Sorry, honeybun! Bad connection...
I'm losing contact.</i>

479
00:39:05,302 --> 00:39:06,595
How convenient!

480
00:39:06,762 --> 00:39:11,016
I knew it! You don't have a clue
where we are, do you?

481
00:39:11,183 --> 00:39:12,518
Sure I do...

482
00:39:12,685 --> 00:39:16,313
- Don't insult me, Yellow-nerd.
- I'm just being social!

483
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,441
You're not. You're lost,
you're just a con man!

484
00:39:20,776 --> 00:39:23,362
We're no closer to Africa
than when we started.

485
00:39:23,529 --> 00:39:28,492
So, let's out the charade.
Go tell everyone what's really going on.

486
00:39:28,659 --> 00:39:32,621
You and I both know
by now we should've already reached...

487
00:39:32,788 --> 00:39:35,040
The sea! Yippee!

488
00:39:36,375 --> 00:39:38,210
Yeah! We're at the sea!

489
00:39:38,377 --> 00:39:40,296
What is the sea, Miss Delf?

490
00:39:40,462 --> 00:39:43,674
It's what lies between us
and Africa, Gigi.

491
00:39:44,091 --> 00:39:48,637
There it is! There's the sea,
right where it was supposed to be!

492
00:39:48,804 --> 00:39:51,724
It's all part of the plan.
I did it!

493
00:39:52,558 --> 00:39:55,603
That's basic migration math, really.

494
00:39:55,769 --> 00:39:58,939
After the fireflies,
I plotted a perpendicular line

495
00:39:59,106 --> 00:40:03,444
to the sub-cutaneous cloud bank,
the one shaped like a kitty cat.

496
00:40:03,611 --> 00:40:04,945
I just had a feeling.

497
00:40:05,112 --> 00:40:08,949
We should stop for the night
before we cross.

498
00:40:21,462 --> 00:40:23,797
What a nice place to stay!

499
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:26,383
So lucky we found it!

500
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:28,510
- I wonder where the others are!
- Welcome

501
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:34,141
to the Beachfront Tree,
the finest accommodation on the coast!

502
00:40:34,308 --> 00:40:36,769
- Sir?
- We're having a special

503
00:40:36,936 --> 00:40:40,856
on our vacation suites,
room service included.

504
00:40:41,523 --> 00:40:44,360
I thought the season was over, sir...

505
00:40:44,985 --> 00:40:47,821
Shut up.
This is extra-business, putz.

506
00:40:47,988 --> 00:40:50,449
Aren't you expecting other travelers?

507
00:40:50,616 --> 00:40:52,952
You know,
crossing the Mediterranean?

508
00:40:53,118 --> 00:40:55,579
Ain't that like half a world away?

509
00:40:55,746 --> 00:40:58,332
Mediterranean. Oh, of course!

510
00:40:59,083 --> 00:41:02,920
So many guests
visit the Mediterranean here!

511
00:41:03,671 --> 00:41:06,757
Lots of tourists, day and night.

512
00:41:06,924 --> 00:41:10,219
Busy like bees.
But we don't have bees.

513
00:41:10,678 --> 00:41:14,098
- Clean bill of health.
- What? Oh yeah...!

514
00:41:14,264 --> 00:41:17,226
But he said
the season was over.

515
00:41:17,393 --> 00:41:20,354
No, no! You're just early!

516
00:41:20,521 --> 00:41:22,606
Lucky you're the first here.

517
00:41:22,773 --> 00:41:25,150
'Cause after that,
it's booked, booked, booked!

518
00:41:25,317 --> 00:41:27,528
Wait. Excuse me.

519
00:41:27,695 --> 00:41:31,448
Can we back up a sec?
What do you mean we're "early"?

520
00:41:31,615 --> 00:41:34,743
- Where are we exactly?
- In Holland.

521
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:41,458
This is Spain. Just look all around you
at the lovely Spanish scenery.

522
00:41:41,625 --> 00:41:46,463
Spain over there, Spain over here.
Spain left and right. Look behind you,

523
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:48,298
more Spain!

524
00:41:48,757 --> 00:41:51,885
Yeah, you won't get
much more Spanish than us!

525
00:41:52,052 --> 00:41:55,222
- Bien-vah-neeedo! Olé!
- I've been to Spain.

526
00:41:55,639 --> 00:41:57,766
Where are the olive trees?

527
00:41:59,184 --> 00:42:01,228
Where...? Frozen.

528
00:42:01,812 --> 00:42:05,816
Dead, all of them.
Just like that, CLACK! Such a disaster.

529
00:42:05,983 --> 00:42:07,943
My wife and I wept!

530
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:12,531
Wept and wept!
Especially her. She just kept saying:

531
00:42:12,698 --> 00:42:14,992
"Where are my olive trees?"

532
00:42:15,534 --> 00:42:18,829
Boy, what a painful time
in our lives that was.

533
00:42:19,038 --> 00:42:20,789
- Wow!
- Yeah!

534
00:42:21,123 --> 00:42:25,502
- Sounds like a national tragedy.
- "Olive-Apocalypse," we called it.

535
00:42:25,669 --> 00:42:28,380
"It'll never look like Spain!"
I said.

536
00:42:29,423 --> 00:42:32,301
It makes it look nothing like Spain.

537
00:42:32,468 --> 00:42:33,886
Terrible, right?

538
00:42:34,053 --> 00:42:37,890
You know, with global warming,
globalization and whatnot,

539
00:42:38,057 --> 00:42:41,351
everything looks the same,
wherever you are!

540
00:42:41,518 --> 00:42:44,271
Take this hole.
One of our luxury suites.

541
00:42:44,438 --> 00:42:47,191
Low fungus, no sap,
ventilation marvelous.

542
00:42:47,357 --> 00:42:51,403
Had a bald eagle stay here once,
true story.

543
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:55,449
Follow me, folks.
I have a nice room for you all.

544
00:42:55,616 --> 00:42:59,912
- Boy oh boy! I could get used to this.
- Not with this sea air.

545
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:01,997
I'm starting to freeze!

546
00:43:02,164 --> 00:43:06,251
You never had a real first name?
That's awful!

547
00:43:06,418 --> 00:43:08,587
Nah, it's just
that my parents never

548
00:43:08,754 --> 00:43:11,215
had time to give me one
before I was...

549
00:43:11,381 --> 00:43:13,842
I've got a few names
we could call you.

550
00:43:14,009 --> 00:43:16,595
You must have thought
about choosing one?

551
00:43:16,762 --> 00:43:19,431
Uh, no. You know what?
It never came up.

552
00:43:19,598 --> 00:43:21,433
What about "Scatterbrain"?

553
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,018
Or "Chicken Wings"?

554
00:43:23,185 --> 00:43:27,397
Enough, Karl! Don't pick on him.
He's had that his whole life.

555
00:43:27,564 --> 00:43:28,816
Not my whole life...

556
00:43:28,982 --> 00:43:32,111
Of course the poor thing
never had a name.

557
00:43:32,277 --> 00:43:36,156
So small he's been forgotten.
Just a bundle of feathers.

558
00:43:39,993 --> 00:43:43,122
Bring a dish of crunchy maggots
to my room.

559
00:43:43,288 --> 00:43:45,124
Right away, sir.

560
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:47,584
You're gonna love 'em.
The best in Holland.

561
00:43:47,751 --> 00:43:49,837
Holland? Holland!

562
00:43:50,003 --> 00:43:53,173
- I meant Spain...
- You said "Holland!"

563
00:43:53,757 --> 00:43:57,761
No, no. "Hollan-daise sauce," amigo!

564
00:44:04,977 --> 00:44:06,436
Holland...

565
00:44:10,482 --> 00:44:15,070
How did you get such a sense
of direction if you're not a migrator?

566
00:44:15,237 --> 00:44:18,657
He must have an internal compass
like homing pigeons.

567
00:44:18,824 --> 00:44:21,660
Are you part pigeon
on your mother's side?

568
00:44:21,827 --> 00:44:23,537
Something like that...

569
00:44:24,454 --> 00:44:26,915
Who sent you?
Where are you taking us?

570
00:44:27,082 --> 00:44:28,792
- Into a trap?
- What?

571
00:44:28,959 --> 00:44:31,670
- To get rid of us?
- Karl, what're you doing?

572
00:44:32,004 --> 00:44:36,175
- Karl, stop it!
- Willy, stay out of this. It's true.

573
00:44:36,341 --> 00:44:38,886
Calm down, son!
What's this all about?

574
00:44:39,052 --> 00:44:41,430
He's an imposter.

575
00:44:41,597 --> 00:44:43,348
And we're in Holland,

576
00:44:43,515 --> 00:44:46,101
not Spain! He's leading us

577
00:44:46,268 --> 00:44:50,731
straight North! He's probably
against migrators. You're sabotaging us!

578
00:44:51,064 --> 00:44:53,025
Karl, we're here by the sea.

579
00:44:53,775 --> 00:44:57,070
On the coast of Holland!

580
00:44:57,237 --> 00:44:58,572
That's North!

581
00:44:58,739 --> 00:45:01,283
When will you people wake up?

582
00:45:02,534 --> 00:45:03,744
Please, where are we?

583
00:45:05,704 --> 00:45:06,788
Spain.

584
00:45:07,456 --> 00:45:10,083
- Well?
- You're trusting rodents now?

585
00:45:11,335 --> 00:45:13,295
They're a bunch of liars!

586
00:45:13,462 --> 00:45:15,255
Hey, that's "Anti-Rat"!

587
00:45:15,422 --> 00:45:18,258
Sorry, this is
just a little family problem.

588
00:45:18,467 --> 00:45:21,094
Just "a little family problem"!

589
00:45:21,261 --> 00:45:23,680
No matter what I say,

590
00:45:23,847 --> 00:45:27,226
my family never seems to listen to me!

591
00:45:27,392 --> 00:45:29,394
What's your problem with me, huh?

592
00:45:29,561 --> 00:45:34,274
Am I too ambitious? Do I speak my mind?
Maybe I'm too modest?

593
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:37,736
I'm too loud for you, am I?

594
00:45:41,073 --> 00:45:42,074
Yes.

595
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:43,867
Well, yes.

596
00:45:44,034 --> 00:45:46,245
OK, in a word, yes, right.

597
00:45:47,079 --> 00:45:48,580
Right on the button.

598
00:45:48,747 --> 00:45:51,708
Well, you won't have to
put up with me anymore.

599
00:45:52,376 --> 00:45:56,296
I'll go find another family,
one that will take me as I am.

600
00:45:56,463 --> 00:45:58,632
- You mean super-obnoxious?
- Max!

601
00:45:59,633 --> 00:46:03,553
- Karl, we gotta stick together.
- Gotta calm down, sweets.

602
00:46:03,929 --> 00:46:06,765
Relax. You're far too tense.

603
00:46:06,932 --> 00:46:08,725
I'm not "too tense"!

604
00:46:09,601 --> 00:46:12,104
Let's take a little flight.

605
00:46:12,271 --> 00:46:15,399
I hear the oxygen is
really pure up here, but

606
00:46:15,565 --> 00:46:17,150
we gotta fly real high.

607
00:46:17,317 --> 00:46:19,486
I'm not "too tense"!

608
00:46:22,447 --> 00:46:24,908
Max, come with us.
You'll like this.

609
00:46:25,993 --> 00:46:27,619
Do I gotta?

610
00:46:29,204 --> 00:46:31,540
Don't get back too late, OK?

611
00:46:31,707 --> 00:46:34,334
Go easy on the oxygen.
Max is still young!

612
00:46:35,585 --> 00:46:37,587
Goodnight, you two.

613
00:46:52,853 --> 00:46:54,146
I'm really sorry

614
00:46:54,313 --> 00:46:55,647
about Karl.

615
00:46:56,148 --> 00:46:59,526
Delf, you know,
Karl's not as bad as all that.

616
00:46:59,693 --> 00:47:01,862
He's right about... some things.

617
00:47:02,029 --> 00:47:05,907
Don't doubt yourself again.
Africa is right across the sea.

618
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,203
- Why are you so sure?
- You've come through.

619
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:14,374
Show off a little!
Why is that so hard for you?

620
00:47:14,541 --> 00:47:16,168
It's just that...

621
00:47:16,835 --> 00:47:19,129
I'm not a migrator, that's all.

622
00:47:22,924 --> 00:47:26,928
Maybe my 6th sense is...
kind of senseless.

623
00:47:27,429 --> 00:47:31,767
It'll be over soon. We're almost there.
Then you're free to go.

624
00:47:32,517 --> 00:47:36,229
You're afraid that once we get there,
we won't let you leave.

625
00:47:36,396 --> 00:47:41,777
That we'll make you lead us back home,
then depend on you year after year.

626
00:47:41,943 --> 00:47:43,195
Is that it?

627
00:47:44,196 --> 00:47:45,655
Let me tell you...

628
00:47:46,156 --> 00:47:48,909
A friend of my dad's
is waiting for us.

629
00:47:49,368 --> 00:47:52,454
A veteran migrator.
And once we're in Africa,

630
00:47:52,621 --> 00:47:56,500
he'll take us under his wing
until one of us can take over.

631
00:47:57,125 --> 00:48:00,295
So, can you just get us to him?

632
00:48:00,462 --> 00:48:03,215
I think so. What's his name?

633
00:48:03,507 --> 00:48:06,259
- His name?
- Yeah, you know... His name!

634
00:48:06,885 --> 00:48:08,470
His name is...

635
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:11,223
<i>Sass... Saaa...</i>

636
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:13,642
Saaaa?

637
00:48:15,811 --> 00:48:16,686
Sam...

638
00:48:17,312 --> 00:48:18,688
- Sam?
- O.

639
00:48:18,855 --> 00:48:19,856
<i>Same'?</i>

640
00:48:20,023 --> 00:48:22,109
O... O'Coole!

641
00:48:22,275 --> 00:48:23,443
"Sam O'Coole"?

642
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:26,446
Yes! Sam O'Coole!

643
00:48:27,114 --> 00:48:29,032
He's... Irish!

644
00:48:29,199 --> 00:48:31,243
Sam O'Coole?

645
00:48:31,785 --> 00:48:34,121
That is the coolest name ever!

646
00:48:34,287 --> 00:48:36,456
He is cool. If you get us to him,

647
00:48:36,623 --> 00:48:39,042
after that you'll be free, I promise.

648
00:48:39,209 --> 00:48:42,087
You can go home
to your friend Ladybug,

649
00:48:42,754 --> 00:48:47,175
she can call you "honeybun"
all day long. I bet you miss that a lot.

650
00:48:47,342 --> 00:48:48,927
Yeah... Well, uh...

651
00:48:49,594 --> 00:48:51,054
Promise?

652
00:48:56,726 --> 00:48:59,438
Promise. Until you're in good hands

653
00:48:59,604 --> 00:49:00,939
with Sam O'Coole.

654
00:49:01,106 --> 00:49:03,900
Fantastic. Alright. Goodnight.

655
00:49:04,067 --> 00:49:06,528
Yes, g-goodnight.

656
00:49:09,948 --> 00:49:13,118
- Sorry, I'm just...
- Excuse me.

657
00:49:13,785 --> 00:49:14,953
See you tomorrow.

658
00:49:17,747 --> 00:49:20,000
I'm OK! I'm fine!

659
00:49:20,167 --> 00:49:22,752
I'm just gonna go stretch my legs.

660
00:49:28,550 --> 00:49:30,552
- It's mine!
- No, it's mine.

661
00:49:30,719 --> 00:49:32,762
No way! That was mine!

662
00:49:32,929 --> 00:49:35,849
Stop it! Mommy said
we weren't supposed to...

663
00:49:36,016 --> 00:49:37,392
No, it's mine! Ow!

664
00:49:38,143 --> 00:49:41,062
Hey! Some of us are trying to sleep!

665
00:49:41,563 --> 00:49:42,731
Quiet down now!

666
00:49:43,482 --> 00:49:45,525
I told you
no fruit flies indoors!

667
00:49:45,692 --> 00:49:49,863
We don't play with food!
Now brush your feathers and go to bed!

668
00:49:50,030 --> 00:49:52,616
Hey, kids!
You want a bedtime story?

669
00:49:52,782 --> 00:49:55,243
- Nah, give us a break.
- No, thanks.

670
00:49:55,702 --> 00:49:57,829
Nah, give us a break.

671
00:49:58,163 --> 00:50:01,041
Pity.
It was a story about the iron birds.

672
00:50:01,208 --> 00:50:02,834
Is it a really scary story?

673
00:50:03,001 --> 00:50:06,671
Are there people
who get chased and scream like...

674
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:11,801
Well, to tell you the truth,

675
00:50:11,968 --> 00:50:15,013
we don't know much
about the iron birds.

676
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:18,600
All we know is,
there are more and more of them.

677
00:50:18,767 --> 00:50:21,853
But no-one's ever seen an iron bird egg.

678
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:25,148
So, they must come from another planet!

679
00:50:34,783 --> 00:50:37,202
6th sense, 6th sense, pfft!

680
00:50:37,369 --> 00:50:39,829
I don't even know if I have 5 senses!

681
00:50:44,501 --> 00:50:48,797
Now, if the North Star is over there,
that must be the evening star

682
00:50:48,964 --> 00:50:53,802
in relation to the constellation of
"I've-no-idea-what-I'm-talking-about!"

683
00:50:55,470 --> 00:50:57,097
<i>Well, don't look at me!</i>

684
00:50:57,264 --> 00:50:59,558
<i>I'm not an astronomer.</i>

685
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:06,606
Excuse me, ma'am?

686
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:09,025
Huh? Ma'am?

687
00:51:09,317 --> 00:51:12,028
Sir! Sorry. Good evening.

688
00:51:13,405 --> 00:51:15,448
Where exactly are we?

689
00:51:16,032 --> 00:51:17,242
On the beach!

690
00:51:17,409 --> 00:51:19,703
Yes, I know that, thank you.

691
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:22,581
I mean, in relation to Africa?

692
00:51:22,747 --> 00:51:25,375
That's the Mediterranean there, right?

693
00:51:26,167 --> 00:51:28,295
Not quite, pal. Sorry to say,

694
00:51:28,461 --> 00:51:30,964
Africa's not around the corner either.

695
00:51:31,548 --> 00:51:33,049
Oh, no!

696
00:51:33,967 --> 00:51:37,429
The Equator, the tropical countries,
which way are they?

697
00:51:37,596 --> 00:51:40,390
Oh, you'll have to ask
my wife about that.

698
00:51:40,557 --> 00:51:42,100
Marjorie!

699
00:51:42,475 --> 00:51:45,395
Coming, honey!
I'm just shopping for dinner!

700
00:51:46,021 --> 00:51:51,067
OK, babydoll, but this young fella
wants some directions to the Equator.

701
00:51:51,651 --> 00:51:54,529
The Equator? Oh, that's easy.

702
00:51:54,696 --> 00:51:57,699
It's at right angles to the trajectory

703
00:51:57,866 --> 00:52:00,660
of the setting sun,
opposite the North Star.

704
00:52:00,827 --> 00:52:03,413
- Is he staying for dinner?
- No, thanks.

705
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:08,084
Any tips
for finding my bearings out there?

706
00:52:08,501 --> 00:52:13,006
Oh, well, you know,
Marjorie and I never go anywhere

707
00:52:13,173 --> 00:52:14,257
on vacation.

708
00:52:14,424 --> 00:52:17,010
He never takes me anywhere.

709
00:52:17,177 --> 00:52:19,429
"We're fine where we are",
he says!

710
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:23,933
She loves it here.

711
00:52:25,602 --> 00:52:27,604
I'm totally useless.

712
00:52:27,771 --> 00:52:30,023
What're you saying that for?

713
00:52:30,649 --> 00:52:34,235
I've been leading a whole family
in the wrong direction.

714
00:52:34,402 --> 00:52:36,696
Just because I wanted
to see the world.

715
00:52:36,863 --> 00:52:38,865
I was only thinking of myself

716
00:52:39,032 --> 00:52:42,118
and I put everyone in danger.
What'll I do?

717
00:52:43,870 --> 00:52:45,497
I think I know exactly

718
00:52:45,664 --> 00:52:47,457
what you need.

719
00:52:47,624 --> 00:52:48,917
Come here.

720
00:52:50,877 --> 00:52:53,797
Well, how do we feel now?

721
00:52:54,214 --> 00:52:57,092
Crushed... by love!

722
00:53:12,482 --> 00:53:15,402
Did I tell ya or did I tell ya?

723
00:53:15,568 --> 00:53:19,239
Breathe it in! The good stuff!

724
00:53:21,366 --> 00:53:22,617
Unreal!

725
00:53:23,201 --> 00:53:25,870
The stars all floaty...

726
00:53:26,579 --> 00:53:28,164
See that unicorn?

727
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:32,794
You won't be able to fly
in a straight line tomorrow!

728
00:53:35,922 --> 00:53:38,717
What do you say?
Maybe a little higher?

729
00:53:46,057 --> 00:53:47,892
I'm very impressed!

730
00:53:48,393 --> 00:53:52,105
- It even worked on the big ones.
- In the master's hands!

731
00:53:52,272 --> 00:53:55,650
So full of yourself!
Ls Fleck in bed too?

732
00:53:55,817 --> 00:53:58,361
Yes. In the hole right across from us.

733
00:54:01,531 --> 00:54:03,366
Where could he have gone?

734
00:54:24,179 --> 00:54:28,558
It's good to crack up with you guys,
because I love you guys!

735
00:54:28,975 --> 00:54:30,852
I love you!

736
00:54:32,145 --> 00:54:35,857
But you don't love me.
No, you don't love me.

737
00:54:36,024 --> 00:54:38,193
We do love you, man,

738
00:54:38,359 --> 00:54:40,153
we do.

739
00:54:40,945 --> 00:54:42,655
What is that?

740
00:54:44,532 --> 00:54:48,912
It's my heart
beating out love for you guys.

741
00:54:53,708 --> 00:54:55,627
An iron bird!

742
00:55:00,715 --> 00:55:02,175
Fleck! Where are you?

743
00:55:02,342 --> 00:55:04,260
Fleck! Answer me!

744
00:55:04,427 --> 00:55:05,470
There!

745
00:55:07,055 --> 00:55:07,931
Fleck...

746
00:55:12,894 --> 00:55:14,938
Oh, no, he wants to try to fly!

747
00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:17,565
Fleck! No!

748
00:55:21,611 --> 00:55:23,488
Iron bird!

749
00:55:23,655 --> 00:55:25,907
We saw an iron bird!

750
00:55:26,074 --> 00:55:27,534
Fleck!

751
00:55:29,244 --> 00:55:30,745
Willy!

752
00:55:52,225 --> 00:55:53,476
Willy!

753
00:56:07,532 --> 00:56:08,533
Help!

754
00:56:18,293 --> 00:56:22,422
Thank-you-very-much-sir.

755
00:56:24,465 --> 00:56:25,758
Fleck!

756
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:30,138
Oh, my little brother! You're alright.

757
00:56:31,139 --> 00:56:32,974
Don't ever do that again!

758
00:56:34,350 --> 00:56:38,187
Sorry. We didn't see
the little guy on the cliff.

759
00:56:38,354 --> 00:56:40,440
Yeah! We're at the sea.

760
00:56:42,358 --> 00:56:45,403
You saved him again!
Thanks, super hero.

761
00:56:45,570 --> 00:56:47,822
Don't thank me, thank him!

762
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:50,992
Thank the blubber!

763
00:56:54,287 --> 00:56:56,414
Really, thanks for everything!

764
00:56:56,581 --> 00:56:59,584
I know what to do now. Goodnight.

765
00:56:59,751 --> 00:57:01,169
Goodnight!

766
00:57:01,628 --> 00:57:03,171
Thanks again.

767
00:57:05,131 --> 00:57:06,507
Delf, I have...

768
00:57:07,508 --> 00:57:09,135
something to tell you.

769
00:57:09,302 --> 00:57:11,679
I think I know, Mr. Hero.

770
00:57:12,138 --> 00:57:14,349
- You do?
- I've seen you look at me.

771
00:57:14,515 --> 00:57:17,143
- That's not it!
- I'm sorry.

772
00:57:17,310 --> 00:57:20,355
I mean, it could be,
but not what I was...

773
00:57:20,521 --> 00:57:22,899
That was stupid of me to assume...

774
00:57:23,066 --> 00:57:26,569
Wow, Delf. You really stepped
into that one. Excuse me.

775
00:57:26,736 --> 00:57:27,737
Wait!

776
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:32,617
I do look at you!
I'm looking at you now... leaving.

777
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:36,746
Why is it so hard
to tell her the truth?

778
00:58:57,952 --> 00:58:59,579
Yellowbird! Wake up!

779
00:59:05,126 --> 00:59:07,462
There are lots in this tree.

780
00:59:07,628 --> 00:59:10,298
Go! Go! I'll catch up!

781
00:59:29,025 --> 00:59:31,444
What kind of a racket are you...

782
00:59:41,537 --> 00:59:45,208
That's it! I'm staying
somewhere else next season.

783
00:59:51,547 --> 00:59:54,133
No! Don't go that way!

784
01:00:07,230 --> 01:00:09,440
Delf! Delf!

785
01:00:10,733 --> 01:00:12,568
Hey! Hey, Stop!

786
01:00:13,486 --> 01:00:16,072
- Everybody stop!
- Look who's back.

787
01:00:17,782 --> 01:00:19,117
Delf, wait!

788
01:00:19,283 --> 01:00:21,327
Look, I don't need an apology.

789
01:00:21,494 --> 01:00:23,162
It's not what I'm trying...

790
01:00:23,329 --> 01:00:27,792
Get us across the sea if my father's
wishes mean anything to you.

791
01:00:27,959 --> 01:00:31,212
That's it!
I don't think this is the right sea!

792
01:00:31,379 --> 01:00:34,590
What's going on?
You're making everyone nervous.

793
01:00:35,174 --> 01:00:38,594
Everyone, listen to me!
I think we should head back.

794
01:00:38,761 --> 01:00:42,223
- Enough already!
- Hey! There's a headwind

795
01:00:42,390 --> 01:00:44,225
up ahead. And a big bank

796
01:00:44,392 --> 01:00:46,227
of scary-looking clouds.

797
01:00:46,561 --> 01:00:49,355
We should listen to him
and head back.

798
01:00:49,522 --> 01:00:50,773
Too late for that!

799
01:00:51,524 --> 01:00:52,525
Too late?

800
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:55,945
From the smell of it,
that storm is gonna hit us.

801
01:00:56,946 --> 01:00:58,281
So what do we do, son?

802
01:00:58,781 --> 01:01:02,660
We need to drop some altitude
and get under the wind tunnel.

803
01:01:03,369 --> 01:01:08,749
Then, try to spot somewhere to land,
a bank of seaweed or the tip of a rock.

804
01:01:09,208 --> 01:01:11,002
I don't like this.

805
01:01:27,643 --> 01:01:30,104
Can you guys see anything?

806
01:01:30,271 --> 01:01:32,064
No, not yet!

807
01:01:32,231 --> 01:01:35,860
Stay under the wind but above the water!
I know it's hard!

808
01:01:36,569 --> 01:01:38,946
Mom! The Wind's making me cold.

809
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:41,449
Hang on, Anton. We'll land soon.

810
01:01:41,782 --> 01:01:45,286
If we can find somewhere...
We don't have much time.

811
01:01:48,206 --> 01:01:51,042
Wait a minute! Over there!

812
01:02:15,650 --> 01:02:18,778
We have to wait
till the storm blows over.

813
01:02:18,945 --> 01:02:20,529
The kids are hungry.

814
01:02:21,364 --> 01:02:24,825
They'll never reach the coast
with empty bellies.

815
01:02:25,826 --> 01:02:28,955
Maybe there's something to eat
down there.

816
01:02:29,121 --> 01:02:30,665
Any other bright ideas?

817
01:02:30,831 --> 01:02:33,793
Karl, listen to him for once.

818
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:38,381
For once! Excuse me, Delf!
Right from the very start,

819
01:02:38,547 --> 01:02:40,800
we've followed every suggestion

820
01:02:40,967 --> 01:02:43,344
of this total s-s-stranger!

821
01:02:43,886 --> 01:02:46,264
How long will he be a stranger?

822
01:02:46,430 --> 01:02:49,183
We're in a pretty bad situation,
Delf honey.

823
01:02:49,350 --> 01:02:51,519
He couldn't have predicted
the storm!

824
01:02:51,686 --> 01:02:54,981
Isn't that what a 6th sense is for?

825
01:02:55,398 --> 01:02:57,066
Say something.

826
01:02:57,608 --> 01:02:59,360
I... I...

827
01:03:00,736 --> 01:03:03,990
<i>I'd shut it.
It's no time to make a speech.</i>

828
01:03:05,950 --> 01:03:07,868
- I'll look for food.
- Wait up!

829
01:03:10,871 --> 01:03:12,415
I'm coming with you.

830
01:03:14,583 --> 01:03:16,711
Willy, go with them.
Michka and I

831
01:03:16,877 --> 01:03:21,132
will go this way.
The rest of you, stay where you are.

832
01:03:49,952 --> 01:03:51,245
Hey! Wait for us.

833
01:03:51,412 --> 01:03:53,706
Why is Karl being such an idiot?

834
01:03:55,082 --> 01:03:57,585
You can't say
he's completely wrong.

835
01:03:57,752 --> 01:03:58,878
You're siding with him?

836
01:03:59,045 --> 01:04:02,089
I'm not the only one.
Look where we are, Delf!

837
01:04:02,256 --> 01:04:04,967
- You've got a crush on him...
- What? No!

838
01:04:05,134 --> 01:04:07,803
- That's not it!
- It's OK if you do.

839
01:04:12,391 --> 01:04:13,601
But...

840
01:04:29,575 --> 01:04:31,577
I can hardly see a thing.

841
01:04:31,744 --> 01:04:34,246
And it smells like a garbage dump.

842
01:04:35,289 --> 01:04:38,042
Please tell me
that was your stomach.

843
01:04:43,672 --> 01:04:46,759
See how Delf sticks up
for that yellow bird?

844
01:04:46,926 --> 01:04:48,427
Yeah... well... I...

845
01:04:49,470 --> 01:04:50,930
Where's Anton?

846
01:05:14,161 --> 01:05:17,164
Your eyeballs popped
right out of your heads!

847
01:05:22,503 --> 01:05:25,047
OK, scaredy-birds!
I get the point.

848
01:05:34,807 --> 01:05:37,143
Maggie, give me a hand!

849
01:05:55,244 --> 01:05:56,537
The children!

850
01:05:59,665 --> 01:06:02,501
They must be in trouble.
We gotta go back!

851
01:06:12,428 --> 01:06:15,014
- Don't panic! Keep calm!
- Yes, right!

852
01:06:15,181 --> 01:06:16,932
EVERYONE KEEP CALM!

853
01:06:17,099 --> 01:06:19,059
- DON'T PANIC!
- Calm down.

854
01:06:19,935 --> 01:06:21,312
Right... Sure.

855
01:06:21,937 --> 01:06:24,398
Let me catch my breath.
This way!

856
01:06:41,999 --> 01:06:45,461
Mommy, I really don't feel too good.

857
01:06:45,628 --> 01:06:48,672
You'll be fine, honey.
You can eat something...

858
01:06:48,839 --> 01:06:52,051
Listen! There are zombies
all over the place!

859
01:06:52,218 --> 01:06:56,305
We've got to get out.
If we can remember where we came from,

860
01:06:56,472 --> 01:06:59,850
we can go the same way.
- The kids are exhausted.

861
01:07:00,017 --> 01:07:02,686
- You have a better solution?
- Stop

862
01:07:02,853 --> 01:07:05,606
sneaking up on us!
- What'll we do?

863
01:07:05,773 --> 01:07:07,024
We can't stay here!

864
01:07:07,191 --> 01:07:08,776
We can't go back into the storm!

865
01:07:08,943 --> 01:07:12,696
That's enough!
From now on, I call the shots!

866
01:07:12,863 --> 01:07:15,533
Anyone who doesn't agree
with what I say

867
01:07:15,699 --> 01:07:18,327
will have to go it alone! Understand?

868
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:25,918
Karl!

869
01:07:34,635 --> 01:07:37,680
Get the kids out.
We'll take care of Karl!

870
01:07:39,974 --> 01:07:41,517
Come on, kid.

871
01:08:30,774 --> 01:08:33,027
- Alright!
- Fleck, what're you doing?

872
01:08:33,193 --> 01:08:36,030
No sweat, Mich!
I've got it covered!

873
01:08:43,287 --> 01:08:44,788
Fleck, no!

874
01:08:45,956 --> 01:08:47,166
Hey!

875
01:08:53,589 --> 01:08:55,716
We did it, guys!

876
01:08:56,508 --> 01:09:00,054
Bravo, little brother!
That was one supersonic flight!

877
01:09:02,222 --> 01:09:03,432
Lisa?

878
01:09:11,065 --> 01:09:12,900
They're birds

879
01:09:13,067 --> 01:09:14,485
just like us!

880
01:09:18,864 --> 01:09:21,158
Come on!
We can still save them!

881
01:10:06,704 --> 01:10:08,038
We're safe!

882
01:10:13,127 --> 01:10:15,879
Oh no! We're caught
in a stream of cold air!

883
01:10:16,380 --> 01:10:19,508
We must slow down!
We're heading North!

884
01:10:21,593 --> 01:10:24,888
- Hold on to me!
- I can't!

885
01:10:49,455 --> 01:10:51,999
Go and warm up
the kids instead, Willy.

886
01:10:53,208 --> 01:10:55,961
They need you. Go.

887
01:11:20,110 --> 01:11:22,696
We're all gonna die here
in the cold!

888
01:11:22,863 --> 01:11:26,283
- Because of you.
- Oh Karl, please.

889
01:11:26,658 --> 01:11:29,077
I should've taken over from Darius!

890
01:11:29,244 --> 01:11:31,705
But he picked you.
Why would he do that?

891
01:11:34,750 --> 01:11:35,959
He didn't.

892
01:11:38,670 --> 01:11:40,547
You're right, Karl. I lied.

893
01:11:41,298 --> 01:11:44,468
I lied to all of you.
I was just a messenger.

894
01:11:44,635 --> 01:11:47,971
Darius just wanted me
to tell Karl to take over.

895
01:11:48,138 --> 01:11:49,389
He said it was

896
01:11:49,556 --> 01:11:51,058
your time to lead.

897
01:11:51,225 --> 01:11:52,643
Darius said that?

898
01:11:52,976 --> 01:11:54,520
I'm sorry.

899
01:11:55,312 --> 01:11:57,356
I wanted to be
part of the flock.

900
01:11:57,856 --> 01:12:01,693
- I had no idea it would...
- How could you do that to us?

901
01:12:02,027 --> 01:12:03,654
I trusted you!

902
01:12:06,907 --> 01:12:10,369
I tried to tell you so many times.

903
01:12:11,620 --> 01:12:14,039
I never wanted to hurt you.

904
01:12:19,169 --> 01:12:20,712
I am so, so sorry.

905
01:12:24,508 --> 01:12:26,969
- Wait!
- Delf...

906
01:12:27,344 --> 01:12:28,720
Let him go.

907
01:13:33,368 --> 01:13:35,120
<i>Honeybun!</i>

908
01:13:38,373 --> 01:13:40,542
<i>Honeybunny!</i>

909
01:15:03,208 --> 01:15:05,669
It's the dumbest idea
I ever heard!

910
01:15:14,302 --> 01:15:17,347
I don't think
the iron birds are dangerous.

911
01:15:17,514 --> 01:15:20,934
They swallow humans,
but spit them out somewhere else.

912
01:15:21,101 --> 01:15:24,187
You're out of your mind.
We'll all get killed!

913
01:15:24,521 --> 01:15:28,025
This guy is both a liar and a numbskull.

914
01:15:28,692 --> 01:15:30,694
- No offense.
- No, that's right.

915
01:15:30,861 --> 01:15:33,280
The reason we changed our path

916
01:15:33,447 --> 01:15:38,035
was to avoid the iron birds,
not to serve ourselves up as appetizers!

917
01:15:38,201 --> 01:15:40,328
We don't know if they eat birds.

918
01:15:40,620 --> 01:15:44,416
Miss Delf, are we gonna be eaten up
by the iron birds?

919
01:15:44,583 --> 01:15:47,419
Don't worry, Gigi, that's not the plan.

920
01:15:47,586 --> 01:15:50,088
I don't know.
The stories we've heard!

921
01:15:50,255 --> 01:15:53,258
Just stories.
This might be our only hope.

922
01:15:53,425 --> 01:15:55,385
Or the worst idea ever.

923
01:15:55,552 --> 01:15:57,637
That Yellowbird has gotten us

924
01:15:57,804 --> 01:16:00,015
into enough jams.
He's never been

925
01:16:00,182 --> 01:16:03,602
straight with us.
This is a dangerous, untested plan.

926
01:16:03,769 --> 01:16:07,189
He's not qualified
to lead this group in any way!

927
01:16:07,355 --> 01:16:10,817
- You realize that?
- That's enough! Stop!

928
01:16:11,234 --> 01:16:16,406
Listen up or I'll turn your earrings
into guts! I'll eat your teeth

929
01:16:16,573 --> 01:16:19,576
till your mother
looks like pigeon puke!

930
01:16:23,580 --> 01:16:26,958
No, it's actually
"I'll rip out your guts"

931
01:16:27,125 --> 01:16:29,294
and I won't eat your teeth...

932
01:16:29,461 --> 01:16:31,755
I deeply apologize to your mother.

933
01:16:32,506 --> 01:16:36,051
What I mean is, I know
I'm responsible for our troubles.

934
01:16:36,551 --> 01:16:39,054
But I also know
that if we stay here,

935
01:16:39,221 --> 01:16:40,555
we're going to die.

936
01:16:40,931 --> 01:16:44,309
If we try this plan,
we have a chance to survive.

937
01:16:44,768 --> 01:16:46,061
Maybe.

938
01:16:49,106 --> 01:16:52,067
- I'll go with a maybe.
- Me too.

939
01:16:52,234 --> 01:16:54,528
- Me too.
- Count me in.

940
01:16:55,070 --> 01:16:59,157
Heck, my whole life is a maybe.
Let's do this.

941
01:16:59,783 --> 01:17:01,326
Yeah, alright.

942
01:17:03,703 --> 01:17:06,289
The cold must've frozen
your bird brains!

943
01:17:19,970 --> 01:17:23,598
OK... but... which one?

944
01:17:40,699 --> 01:17:41,741
That one.

945
01:17:45,453 --> 01:17:47,664
I don't want you to see this.

946
01:17:47,831 --> 01:17:48,915
Aw, Mom!

947
01:18:15,358 --> 01:18:17,694
OK, we're good to go!

948
01:18:25,035 --> 01:18:28,205
Oh, boy! That's cold!

949
01:18:35,795 --> 01:18:37,255
Now what?

950
01:18:37,422 --> 01:18:39,174
We go in there.

951
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:43,970
Into its behind?

952
01:18:44,137 --> 01:18:46,765
As soon as their backs are turned...

953
01:18:56,233 --> 01:18:57,317
Now's our chance!

954
01:19:10,455 --> 01:19:11,831
Wait! Where's Karl?

955
01:19:12,332 --> 01:19:13,625
Stay here!

956
01:19:18,797 --> 01:19:21,216
Karl, we gotta go!

957
01:19:21,508 --> 01:19:25,220
- Quick!
- You can all doom yourselves. I won't!

958
01:19:25,387 --> 01:19:26,930
I can't believe this!

959
01:19:39,401 --> 01:19:40,568
What's that?

960
01:19:41,069 --> 01:19:42,195
Let me go!

961
01:19:44,197 --> 01:19:45,782
I won't leave you.

962
01:19:53,957 --> 01:19:55,333
Oh no!

963
01:20:04,426 --> 01:20:05,635
Come on!

964
01:20:11,099 --> 01:20:13,101
The door is closing!

965
01:20:18,857 --> 01:20:21,484
Get in there, Karl! Go!

966
01:20:35,248 --> 01:20:38,335
- Is this normal?
- I think we're flying!

967
01:20:44,674 --> 01:20:46,217
- Karl...
- What?

968
01:20:46,384 --> 01:20:47,719
Thank you.

969
01:20:48,428 --> 01:20:49,763
- Don't mention it.
- OK.

970
01:20:49,929 --> 01:20:52,766
I mean it.
We don't ever mention it again.

971
01:20:53,433 --> 01:20:55,352
Ever, you hear?

972
01:22:12,846 --> 01:22:14,681
You should come and see this!

973
01:22:22,397 --> 01:22:23,898
Africa!

974
01:23:01,769 --> 01:23:04,105
So wonderful to be back!

975
01:23:04,772 --> 01:23:07,400
Look at this splendid view.

976
01:23:07,609 --> 01:23:08,735
It's beautiful!

977
01:23:08,902 --> 01:23:11,446
Even better than I remember.

978
01:23:11,613 --> 01:23:14,240
- We did it, guys.
- Hurray!

979
01:23:14,407 --> 01:23:15,700
High-five!

980
01:23:15,867 --> 01:23:17,118
Yeah, man!

981
01:23:19,704 --> 01:23:21,998
Now we stay put for 6 months.

982
01:23:27,378 --> 01:23:28,505
Hey!

983
01:23:28,671 --> 01:23:31,007
Where do you think you're going?

984
01:23:31,174 --> 01:23:34,010
Well... you're in Africa.

985
01:23:34,385 --> 01:23:36,888
I'll just leave you guys alone.

986
01:23:37,222 --> 01:23:38,848
You can't go now.

987
01:23:39,474 --> 01:23:43,520
You don't need me now.
You just have to find Sam O'Coole.

988
01:23:43,937 --> 01:23:49,943
Sam O'Coole? Wow! What kind
of made-up-on-the-spot name is that?

989
01:23:50,109 --> 01:23:51,736
You're joking, right?

990
01:23:52,070 --> 01:23:54,864
- Only a turkey falls for that!
- Wait...

991
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:56,783
Delf, when you said...

992
01:23:56,950 --> 01:23:59,202
And I said...
So the whole time...

993
01:23:59,661 --> 01:24:01,621
I'm such an idiot.

994
01:24:03,039 --> 01:24:04,624
No, I don't think so.

995
01:24:05,124 --> 01:24:08,211
You sure took me for a ride.
Sam O'Coole.

996
01:24:08,378 --> 01:24:12,131
- No-one can carry off that name.
- Someone could.

997
01:24:13,466 --> 01:24:15,426
I mean the Sam part.

998
01:24:16,886 --> 01:24:18,471
"Sam!" Yeah!

999
01:24:18,638 --> 01:24:21,182
- It suits you perfectly.
- Totally!

1000
01:24:21,349 --> 01:24:23,851
You need a real first name, right?

1001
01:24:24,018 --> 01:24:27,397
You're not getting a say in this.
If all this yelling

1002
01:24:27,564 --> 01:24:30,858
and judging and pecking at each other

1003
01:24:31,025 --> 01:24:33,903
doesn't make us family,
I don't know what does.

1004
01:24:34,070 --> 01:24:36,864
We froze in a snowstorm,
and I was right...

1005
01:24:37,031 --> 01:24:39,075
Karl! Drop it!

1006
01:24:40,910 --> 01:24:44,664
OK. Riding those iron birds
was a pretty good idea...

1007
01:24:45,039 --> 01:24:46,291
Sam!

1008
01:24:47,375 --> 01:24:50,545
Hey, little fella,
you're part of the flock now.

1009
01:25:01,514 --> 01:25:05,184
<i>Well done, honeybun!
I'm so proud of you!</i>

1010
01:25:05,560 --> 01:25:09,397
<i>Maybe I exaggerated a bit,
but you don't mind?</i>

1011
01:25:09,564 --> 01:25:12,233
<i>You did ever so well, Sam.</i>

1012
01:25:13,151 --> 01:25:16,154
Hey! We gotta celebrate this.

1013
01:25:17,405 --> 01:25:18,865
Let's go.

1014
01:25:29,959 --> 01:25:33,338

1016

Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
