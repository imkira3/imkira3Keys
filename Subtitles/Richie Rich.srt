<i>I still remember it
as if it were yesterday</i>

3
00:00:59,174 --> 00:01:04,887
<i>A cold and frosty November morning
when Master Richie came into the world</i>

4
00:01:05,221 --> 00:01:07,098
I have a son.

5
00:01:13,854 --> 00:01:18,942
<i>And I,
Herbert Arthur Runcible Cadbury</i>

6
00:01:21,069 --> 00:01:23,488
<i>born in the tradition of service</i>

7
00:01:24,405 --> 00:01:26,741
<i>was to become
his gentleman's gentleman</i>

8
00:01:26,908 --> 00:01:30,953
<i>or as you Americans would say,
his butler</i>

9
00:01:31,746 --> 00:01:37,042
<i>Richie Rich was the long-awaited
first child of Richard and Regina Rich</i>

10
00:01:37,209 --> 00:01:41,755
<i>and at 7 pounds, 6 ounces,
was immediately proclaimed</i>

11
00:01:41,922 --> 00:01:45,133
<i>the wealthiest baby in the world</i>

12
00:01:48,344 --> 00:01:53,808
<i>Truly, Master Richie was born into
a life of great wealth and privilege</i>

13
00:01:54,350 --> 00:02:00,564
<i>and yet, he was assuredly
his parents' most valued treasure</i>

14
00:02:03,192 --> 00:02:05,986
Can you say, "Wall Street"?

15
00:02:06,695 --> 00:02:08,655
"Wall Street"?

16
00:02:08,947 --> 00:02:13,076
- Can you say, "blue chip"?
- Bunches and bunches of money.

17
00:02:13,243 --> 00:02:17,163
- That's how much mommy loves you.
- Can you say, "convertible debenture"?

18
00:02:18,331 --> 00:02:20,541
<i>From the day he left his cradle</i>

19
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:23,794
<i>I undertook to show him
all that was good in life</i>

20
00:02:24,003 --> 00:02:27,548
<i>And I am delighted to report
that never was there a child</i>

21
00:02:27,715 --> 00:02:29,841
<i>with a sweeter disposition</i>

22
00:02:30,509 --> 00:02:34,346
<i>or a more spirited sense of play</i>

23
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:38,183
<i>Although his father,
the senior Richard Rich</i>

24
00:02:38,349 --> 00:02:43,187
<i>spent countless hours in his office,
overseeing his vast business empire</i>

25
00:02:43,354 --> 00:02:45,564
Rich to buy 100 million acres of jungle.

26
00:02:45,731 --> 00:02:50,945
<i>he still found time to share
simple pleasures with his son</i>

27
00:02:51,111 --> 00:02:53,572
Thank you, Cadbury.

28
00:02:55,532 --> 00:02:56,908
Go and build it anyway.

29
00:02:57,075 --> 00:03:00,954
<i>As he grew, Master Richie
developed a keen interest in sports</i>

30
00:03:01,746 --> 00:03:04,666
Just a minute. Great toss, son.

31
00:03:06,584 --> 00:03:10,630
<i>- Beep beep, coming through.
- He had everything a boy could want</i>

32
00:03:10,796 --> 00:03:12,423
<i>Although at the age of 3</i>

33
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:16,677
<i>his driving skills
left something to be desired</i>

34
00:03:18,762 --> 00:03:22,099
We have to have our Arab friends
understand that. Just a minute.

35
00:03:22,265 --> 00:03:24,059
Nice throw, slugger.

36
00:03:24,267 --> 00:03:30,023
<i>With baseball, however, he displayed
a quite precocious talent</i>

37
00:03:30,398 --> 00:03:31,607
Next Tuesday, right.

38
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:37,655
<i>which, as the years progressed</i>

39
00:03:39,657 --> 00:03:43,494
<i>became more than
just a favorite pastime</i>

40
00:03:49,124 --> 00:03:51,543
Not bad. Let's try this this time.

41
00:03:51,751 --> 00:03:53,711
I want you to get the back elbow up.

42
00:03:53,878 --> 00:03:56,714
That a way. Get the bat right here.
Shoulders square.

43
00:03:56,923 --> 00:03:59,425
Nice level swing.
Keep your eye on the baseball.

44
00:03:59,592 --> 00:04:02,636
okay, pitch. Put some heat on it this time.

45
00:04:07,641 --> 00:04:09,309
That's it.

46
00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:12,771
Nice hitting, Richie.

47
00:04:15,774 --> 00:04:18,026
Sorry, Charles!

48
00:04:18,693 --> 00:04:22,321
Good clubbing, Master Richie.
You're scoring loads of points.

49
00:04:22,488 --> 00:04:24,991
They're called runs, Cadbury. Runs.

50
00:04:25,157 --> 00:04:28,494
of course. But I'm afraid
we must run, sir.

51
00:04:28,661 --> 00:04:31,955
- Can I have just one more inning?
- That really isn't possible.

52
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,918
- Thank you, Mr. Jackson.
- You're welcome, Richie. Any time.

53
00:04:37,085 --> 00:04:38,670
All right, pack it all up.

54
00:04:39,462 --> 00:04:43,466
<i>In addition to his life of fun and games,
of luxury and privilege</i>

55
00:04:43,842 --> 00:04:47,970
<i>Master Richie was obliged to undertake
responsibilities far beyond those</i>

56
00:04:48,179 --> 00:04:51,599
<i>- of any normal child
- It's a great day for a celebration...</i>

57
00:04:51,807 --> 00:04:53,642
...and a great day for United Tool!

58
00:04:53,851 --> 00:04:57,021
We're gonna wait for Mr. Rich
because he said he'd be here.

59
00:04:57,187 --> 00:05:00,983
Today marks a miracle of sorts
here at United Tool.

60
00:05:01,191 --> 00:05:06,696
This factory, once bankrupt,
and 600 jobs about to disappear forever...

61
00:05:06,863 --> 00:05:10,158
...is now celebrating
a new lease on life...

62
00:05:10,325 --> 00:05:14,787
...thanks to billionaire businessman
and philanthropist Richard Rich.

63
00:05:14,954 --> 00:05:19,208
And it looks like Richard Rich
will be arriving here in moments.

64
00:05:45,065 --> 00:05:49,027
Hi. My dad couldn't make it,
so he sent me. I'm Richie.

65
00:05:49,194 --> 00:05:50,946
Fellas, come on. Let me through.

66
00:05:51,154 --> 00:05:55,075
Welcome to United Tools, Richie.
My name is Dave Walter, the plant manager.

67
00:05:55,242 --> 00:05:57,369
This is Diane Koscinski, our union rep.

68
00:05:57,577 --> 00:05:59,704
Diane's gonna be making
our presentation.

69
00:05:59,871 --> 00:06:03,082
- We're really glad you could come.
- Me too. This is Cadbury.

70
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:06,961
- Master Richie's valet.
- oh, a valet? Never met one of your type.

71
00:06:07,128 --> 00:06:10,214
That doesn't altogether
surprise me, madam.

72
00:06:12,549 --> 00:06:14,051
Richie who?

73
00:06:14,259 --> 00:06:18,388
What planet you been living on?
Richie Rich, the richest kid in the world.

74
00:06:20,348 --> 00:06:24,269
And now, our union rep, Diane Koscinski,
is gonna make our presentation.

75
00:06:25,561 --> 00:06:27,980
Look, Gloria, your mom's
gonna make a speech.

76
00:06:28,147 --> 00:06:31,484
Who cares about speeches?
Let's play some ball.

77
00:06:32,777 --> 00:06:33,944
Fellow workers...

78
00:06:34,111 --> 00:06:36,822
- Gloria, let's go!
- Come on, guys, let's play!

79
00:06:37,031 --> 00:06:39,575
It isn't just this company,
it's the whole town.

80
00:06:42,619 --> 00:06:44,287
And on this special morning...

81
00:06:44,454 --> 00:06:47,874
...the first day of retooling that's gonna
bring our jobs back...

82
00:06:49,584 --> 00:06:51,961
...we're gonna ask Richie to accept...

83
00:06:52,128 --> 00:06:55,214
...a gold-plated socket wrench set
for his dad.

84
00:06:57,091 --> 00:06:59,176
Thank you, Richie.

85
00:07:08,477 --> 00:07:10,937
on behalf of my dad,
thanks for the wrenches.

86
00:07:11,438 --> 00:07:16,150
I know my dad loves socket wrenches.
I know I love socket wrenches.

87
00:07:17,235 --> 00:07:21,322
If my mom knew what a socket wrench was,
I'm sure she'd love it too.

88
00:07:26,327 --> 00:07:29,079
I'd like to stay, but I gotta
go do my homework.

89
00:07:29,246 --> 00:07:30,455
It's been real.

90
00:07:32,165 --> 00:07:34,292
Thank you.
I'm sure you'll all join me...

91
00:07:34,459 --> 00:07:37,962
...in giving Richie a big
United Tools thank-you!

92
00:07:38,171 --> 00:07:42,717
I hope you're hungry. We got wieners
on the grill. Make sure you have partners...

93
00:07:42,884 --> 00:07:47,138
...for that egg toss. Plenty of prizes
and you're gonna win one. You are.

94
00:07:47,346 --> 00:07:50,975
This is a great day, and I hope
you all stick around to enjoy it.

95
00:07:51,183 --> 00:07:54,061
We've got plenty of games,
plenty of contests.

96
00:07:54,228 --> 00:07:56,646
Lots and lots of things for the kids.

97
00:07:57,189 --> 00:07:58,899
Heads up.

98
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,613
This area is not secure, sir.
Please return to the helicopter.

99
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:06,989
- I wanted...
- I said...

100
00:08:07,532 --> 00:08:09,659
Don't touch him.

101
00:08:11,702 --> 00:08:13,496
Master Richie...

102
00:08:13,704 --> 00:08:17,332
...you have a very busy afternoon,
so we must be on our way.

103
00:08:22,087 --> 00:08:24,130
It's my job to protect him.

104
00:08:24,297 --> 00:08:27,884
very well, Mr. Ferguson,
but grab him like that again...

105
00:08:28,051 --> 00:08:30,261
...and you will need protection.

106
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:43,232
- Poor kid.
- "Poor kid"? What are you talking about?

107
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:45,317
He's the richest kid in the world.

108
00:08:45,484 --> 00:08:48,487
You don't have children, do you, Dave?

109
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:54,117
Hey, it's taking off.

110
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:59,372
Man, it must be cool
to have everything.

111
00:09:02,249 --> 00:09:04,585
- Come on, let's play ball.
- Yeah, let's go.

112
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:07,546
Come on, Gloria, put it over. Let's go.

113
00:09:07,963 --> 00:09:12,926
<i>It was then that Richie realized
there was something missing in his life</i>

114
00:09:13,093 --> 00:09:14,803
<i>Something simple</i>

115
00:09:15,387 --> 00:09:18,598
<i>Something money could not buy</i>

116
00:09:21,392 --> 00:09:26,355
Yes, Mrs. Rich, we're flying over
the estate now. We'll be arriving shortly.

117
00:09:26,522 --> 00:09:31,026
What? oh, I'm sure he'll be
very happy to hear the news.

118
00:09:31,193 --> 00:09:34,821
Master Rich, your father is home
from his business trip.

119
00:09:34,988 --> 00:09:36,323
Great.

120
00:09:58,969 --> 00:10:01,096
- Richie.
- Hello, James. Hobbes.

121
00:10:01,304 --> 00:10:02,931
Welcome home, sir.

122
00:10:06,267 --> 00:10:08,770
Dollar! Come here. Come here.

123
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:12,815
Good. What you doing?
What's going on?

124
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:15,234
Where's Mom and Dad?

125
00:10:17,319 --> 00:10:19,613
Mount Richmore?

126
00:10:20,864 --> 00:10:23,325
I said we needed
a family portrait, Regina...

127
00:10:24,034 --> 00:10:26,995
...but this?
- It was Rafaella's idea.

128
00:10:27,287 --> 00:10:30,248
She's the artist. I didn't want
to stifle her creativity.

129
00:10:30,415 --> 00:10:32,959
oh, honey, you know me.
I'm all for the arts.

130
00:10:33,293 --> 00:10:35,336
Don't you think
it's a tad pretentious?

131
00:10:35,503 --> 00:10:38,381
our faces 100 feet high?

132
00:10:38,548 --> 00:10:40,633
Wait till Geraldo gets ahold of this.

133
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:42,718
Richard, dove, you're overreacting.

134
00:10:42,885 --> 00:10:44,762
Say, how'd she get it done so fast?

135
00:10:44,929 --> 00:10:46,180
I've been gone a week.

136
00:10:46,347 --> 00:10:50,517
Professor Keenbean invented a proton
particle maximizer. Something like that.

137
00:10:50,684 --> 00:10:52,769
Anyway, it seems to do the job.

138
00:10:52,978 --> 00:10:54,813
My cheeks are too puffy.

139
00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:58,108
I know, I know, Regina.
I put on a few pounds.

140
00:10:58,316 --> 00:11:01,736
But you have to admit
that I do look puffy up there.

141
00:11:01,986 --> 00:11:05,656
- Dad.
- Hey, slugger. Great to see you.

142
00:11:05,906 --> 00:11:07,700
How you doing, big fella?

143
00:11:07,992 --> 00:11:09,994
How was the ribbon-cutting at United?

144
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,287
- Great. They gave you a gift.
- They did?

145
00:11:12,454 --> 00:11:15,332
- Socket wrenches, sir.
- oh, socket wrenches.

146
00:11:15,499 --> 00:11:17,667
Son, I love a good socket wrench.

147
00:11:17,876 --> 00:11:21,212
Dad, while I was there, there were
these kids playing baseball.

148
00:11:21,379 --> 00:11:23,381
- Baseball? Great.
- Yeah. And so...

149
00:11:23,548 --> 00:11:26,509
Excuse me, sir. It's a telephone call,
the president.

150
00:11:26,718 --> 00:11:28,761
- What country?
- This one, sir.

151
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,349
Probably needs another loan.
This won't take long. I'll be right back.

152
00:11:35,684 --> 00:11:38,020
Mom, I was wondering.

153
00:11:38,187 --> 00:11:40,689
If it's okay,
can I invite some kids over?

154
00:11:40,897 --> 00:11:42,232
of course, dear.

155
00:11:42,774 --> 00:11:48,029
A dinner party. Well, you just tell me who
and when and we'll send out the invitations.

156
00:11:48,196 --> 00:11:52,158
- Not a party, Mom. Just something...
- Informal? All right, then.

157
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:53,868
More like a buffet.

158
00:11:54,118 --> 00:11:56,871
We can use the oak Room.
That room is large enough...

159
00:11:57,079 --> 00:11:59,707
...to accommodate your friends.
- My friends...

160
00:12:00,082 --> 00:12:02,543
They're always busy.
I don't wanna bother them.

161
00:12:02,709 --> 00:12:04,336
Excuse me, Master Richie.

162
00:12:04,503 --> 00:12:07,631
It's time for your chemistry lesson
with Professor Keenbean.

163
00:12:07,798 --> 00:12:11,259
- Do I have to?
- A schedule, sir, is like a house of cards.

164
00:12:11,468 --> 00:12:13,887
Take one away and they all
come tumbling down.

165
00:12:14,846 --> 00:12:17,390
- Mom?
- I'm afraid so, Richie.

166
00:12:17,557 --> 00:12:19,559
- calculus, well, then, where are we?

167
00:12:19,976 --> 00:12:22,478
<i>In the Rich Manor basement,
you stockholders</i>

168
00:12:22,645 --> 00:12:25,981
<i>are looking at the answer
to the problem of waste management</i>

169
00:12:26,148 --> 00:12:30,569
<i>I, Professor Keenbean here,
with Rich Industries' latest breakthrough:</i>

170
00:12:30,736 --> 00:12:34,739
<i>The subatomic molecular reorganizer!</i>

171
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,743
<i>Useless garbage is broken down
to its basic molecular components</i>

172
00:12:38,952 --> 00:12:42,330
<i>then recombined to form
a whole range of useful new items</i>

173
00:12:42,497 --> 00:12:44,624
<i>from bedpans to bowling balls</i>

174
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:48,043
<i>Hey, need a new bedpan? I know I do</i>

175
00:12:48,252 --> 00:12:53,757
<i>It's quick, it's easy, and in no time at all</i>

176
00:12:53,966 --> 00:12:58,803
<i>we've taken 15 pounds of yesterday's
garbage and transformed it</i>

177
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:03,516
<i>into a beautiful new bed...
Bowling ball There's one</i>

178
00:13:03,725 --> 00:13:07,395
<i>Twins And what family doesn't
need a spare?</i>

179
00:13:07,562 --> 00:13:11,148
<i>Here they come Oh, boy, oh, boy</i>

180
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:12,942
<i>Cut! Cut!</i>

181
00:13:13,109 --> 00:13:14,985
Cut, cut, cut.

182
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:18,864
Still not working, is it, professor?

183
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:22,325
Still a few kinks need ironing out,
but not to worry.

184
00:13:22,492 --> 00:13:25,954
- You ready for your chemistry tutorial?
- I'm not in the mood.

185
00:13:26,496 --> 00:13:28,498
What else are you working on?

186
00:13:29,874 --> 00:13:31,834
This one will fry your circuits.

187
00:13:32,043 --> 00:13:36,297
I don't mean to play favorites,
but I'm stuck on this one.

188
00:13:36,464 --> 00:13:37,673
It's a new adhesive.

189
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:42,219
Ten times stickier than
the strongest adhesive known to man.

190
00:13:42,386 --> 00:13:45,264
I call it "Cementia"!

191
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:47,349
Wait till you see what's over here.

192
00:13:47,516 --> 00:13:50,226
Help me. Help me. Help me.

193
00:14:20,546 --> 00:14:23,591
Hey, Paula! Listen up!

194
00:14:23,883 --> 00:14:26,052
Suck in the cheeks!

195
00:14:26,385 --> 00:14:29,972
- Bad news, I'm afraid, honey.
- Don't tell me you're flying out again.

196
00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:31,849
Tonight after dinner. I'm sorry.

197
00:14:32,015 --> 00:14:34,768
We were supposed
to spend some time together.

198
00:14:34,935 --> 00:14:36,395
How do you put up with me?

199
00:14:36,728 --> 00:14:39,981
Well, you do have $ 70 billion.

200
00:14:40,398 --> 00:14:42,108
Is that the only reason?

201
00:14:45,445 --> 00:14:46,779
No.

202
00:14:46,988 --> 00:14:49,865
You also have a cute butt.

203
00:14:55,412 --> 00:14:56,872
Cadbury, did you hear that?

204
00:14:57,039 --> 00:14:59,875
Indeed, sir. Madam admires your butt.

205
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:01,626
I'm most delighted for you.

206
00:15:06,089 --> 00:15:09,884
Now, this makes any fabric
instantly impervious.

207
00:15:10,093 --> 00:15:16,098
Dirt proof, stain proof, waterproof, and...

208
00:15:16,265 --> 00:15:18,058
Sherman!

209
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:23,480
Guess so. Pulled the hair off my head...

210
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:26,191
Fire in the hole!

211
00:15:36,743 --> 00:15:41,122
And bulletproof. It's not perfect.
It's hell on the dry-cleaning bill.

212
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:43,040
No kidding.

213
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:45,167
Nice grouping, Sherman.

214
00:15:45,501 --> 00:15:48,754
- What's this, a bee?
- Nope. That's a paperweight.

215
00:15:48,962 --> 00:15:51,965
This is a bee.

216
00:15:53,341 --> 00:15:58,221
A hundred bees working overtime
couldn't pollinate like this baby.

217
00:15:58,638 --> 00:16:00,682
Behold Robo-Bee.

218
00:16:01,474 --> 00:16:03,643
Here. Take it for a test flight.

219
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:11,900
Handles like a dream, huh?

220
00:16:13,944 --> 00:16:16,905
Careful. Teams of scientists
have worked day and night...

221
00:16:17,072 --> 00:16:19,824
...developing the latest
in microcircuit technology.

222
00:16:19,991 --> 00:16:21,618
Your afternoon tea, sir.

223
00:16:21,993 --> 00:16:26,164
Millions and millions of dollars
have been spent on this one bee alone.

224
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:43,513
Come here! Come here, you!
Come! You're gonna need this!

225
00:16:59,987 --> 00:17:04,950
Thirty-seven and a half miles of driveway.
You park in the 5 feet with a puddle.

226
00:17:05,325 --> 00:17:07,160
I'm very sorry, sir.

227
00:17:08,036 --> 00:17:12,499
You're sorry. Well, in that case,
find another job.

228
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:17,545
Good evening, Mr. van Dough.
It's nice to see you, sir.

229
00:17:17,753 --> 00:17:21,298
I've checked their schedule.
I've got the perfect time...

230
00:17:21,465 --> 00:17:24,510
Not now, moron. We'll talk later.

231
00:17:25,386 --> 00:17:28,514
Thank you very much,
Mr. van Dough, sir.

232
00:17:35,145 --> 00:17:37,856
<i>- Hello?
- Richie, dear</i>

233
00:17:38,022 --> 00:17:40,275
<i>Are you sure you don't want
to dine with us?</i>

234
00:17:40,441 --> 00:17:43,528
It's okay, Mom.
I really don't like that guy.

235
00:17:44,111 --> 00:17:46,197
That's all right, dear. Neither do I.

236
00:17:47,239 --> 00:17:49,283
<i>But foie de veau is very good for you.</i>

237
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:50,909
Liver is rich in protein.

238
00:17:52,703 --> 00:17:54,246
It's so tasty too.

239
00:17:55,914 --> 00:17:57,416
Bye, Mom.

240
00:18:01,294 --> 00:18:03,963
Laurence, let's get back
to what you were saying...

241
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:06,799
...about our charitable contributions.
- Yes, sir.

242
00:18:06,966 --> 00:18:09,927
I'm all in favor of charity, sir,
but your donations...

243
00:18:10,094 --> 00:18:13,097
...are costing the corporation
a billion dollars a year...

244
00:18:13,264 --> 00:18:15,641
...and I think it's time we asked ourselves:

245
00:18:15,808 --> 00:18:18,393
- What are we getting for it?
- What are we getting?

246
00:18:18,602 --> 00:18:22,522
We're getting food banks, medical clinics,
shelters for the homeless...

247
00:18:22,731 --> 00:18:25,608
It's Laurence's job
to keep an eye on the bottom line.

248
00:18:25,775 --> 00:18:29,070
Which is also why I have to oppose
the United Tool acquisition.

249
00:18:29,237 --> 00:18:32,281
We should be getting rid
of dead weight, not acquire it.

250
00:18:32,573 --> 00:18:33,908
I agree.

251
00:18:34,075 --> 00:18:38,913
- That's why I am getting rid of United Tool.
- Richard! All those people and their jobs!

252
00:18:39,622 --> 00:18:41,999
That is brilliant.
I should've thought of it.

253
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:44,960
We buy the company in bankruptcy.
Level the factories.

254
00:18:45,294 --> 00:18:49,130
No, no, Laurence. I'm keeping
the factory open, like I said.

255
00:18:49,714 --> 00:18:51,883
Then we go in and we bust the unions...

256
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:54,761
...slash benefits,
and then we sell the company.

257
00:18:54,969 --> 00:18:57,472
No. We give it away.

258
00:18:57,805 --> 00:19:01,642
We give it... We give it away.

259
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:04,520
Absolutely. We modernize it,
of course, and retool.

260
00:19:04,687 --> 00:19:07,189
Then we turn the factory
over to the workers.

261
00:19:07,356 --> 00:19:09,942
Richard, that's a wonderful plan.

262
00:19:11,485 --> 00:19:14,070
Mr. Rich! Mr. Rich!

263
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:16,781
Mr. Rich. I've done it.

264
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:21,452
- May I present the Smellmaster.
- Keenbean, that's fantastic.

265
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:23,704
Richie, come down here and try this.

266
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:28,209
Glasses help us see better,
and hearing aids help us hear better.

267
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,961
We should have something
to help us smell better.

268
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:33,547
We do, dear. It's called Chanel.

269
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:39,386
But the Smellmaster 9000
converts any smell within 20 yards...

270
00:19:39,552 --> 00:19:42,722
...into a digital audio signal.
Here, son. Try it.

271
00:19:45,016 --> 00:19:48,978
<i>Wine, Petite Syrah 1974</i>

272
00:19:50,688 --> 00:19:54,108
<i>Roses Hilversum
Demi-bloom Fresh-cut</i>

273
00:19:54,358 --> 00:19:57,402
- Cool.
- That's marvelous.

274
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,865
<i>Foie de veau. Calves' liver</i>

275
00:20:02,032 --> 00:20:05,076
- Richie.
- Better make some adjustments, Dad.

276
00:20:05,285 --> 00:20:08,872
This thing's way out of whack.
Can I be excused? Thank you.

277
00:20:09,205 --> 00:20:10,957
Come on, Dollar. Traitor.

278
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:15,628
Sir, this is precisely the sort of thing
I'm talking about. Toys like that.

279
00:20:15,878 --> 00:20:18,506
Toys? Good God, man.

280
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:20,799
To me, it represents...

281
00:20:20,966 --> 00:20:23,552
...good old-fashioned ingenuity
and know-how.

282
00:20:23,719 --> 00:20:25,387
Right, Keenbean?

283
00:20:29,224 --> 00:20:30,767
Yes, sir.

284
00:20:32,894 --> 00:20:35,521
I see, sir, you bought a new Monet.

285
00:20:35,688 --> 00:20:37,023
- Spectacular.
- Thanks.

286
00:20:37,231 --> 00:20:40,359
Might I suggest you consider
beefing up the security system?

287
00:20:40,526 --> 00:20:44,697
I don't think that'll be necessary.
After all, all of our real valuables...

288
00:20:44,905 --> 00:20:47,616
...are locked in the Rich family vault.

289
00:20:47,908 --> 00:20:49,117
vault?

290
00:20:49,618 --> 00:20:51,078
The family vault?

291
00:20:51,912 --> 00:20:54,039
Someday I'll give you a tour.

292
00:20:54,623 --> 00:20:56,041
I'd like that.

293
00:20:56,249 --> 00:20:58,209
Again, thank you for a lovely evening.

294
00:20:59,002 --> 00:21:00,712
It is our great pleasure.

295
00:21:01,045 --> 00:21:03,714
- Good night.
- Good night.

296
00:21:05,049 --> 00:21:07,384
- Drive carefully.
- Seat belt.

297
00:21:11,889 --> 00:21:15,350
- Morning, Charles.
- Good morning, Billy.

298
00:21:21,481 --> 00:21:24,067
I gotta get another job.

299
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:57,348
Morning, sir. It's time.

300
00:21:57,723 --> 00:22:01,226
Rise and shine, Master Richie.
Let's not be a slug abed.

301
00:22:01,393 --> 00:22:04,438
You have a very busy schedule
in front of you.

302
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:07,190
oh, what a beautiful morning.

303
00:22:07,649 --> 00:22:10,860
Come along. You mustn't keep
your personal trainer waiting.

304
00:22:11,027 --> 00:22:14,364
Please tell Arnold I really don't
feel like exercising today.

305
00:22:21,454 --> 00:22:24,999
I hope you don't mind,
but Arnold canceled.

306
00:22:25,165 --> 00:22:28,544
So I'll be filling in today.
My name is Claudia.

307
00:22:31,505 --> 00:22:34,341
And arms to sides. Bend your legs.
Stretch.

308
00:22:34,507 --> 00:22:38,386
And all the way up. And one
more time. Down and back up.

309
00:22:38,553 --> 00:22:41,514
Now stretch to the left. To the right.

310
00:22:41,681 --> 00:22:43,808
one more time.

311
00:22:44,058 --> 00:22:46,519
Cadbury, about Arnold...

312
00:22:46,894 --> 00:22:48,854
Arnold's history, sir.

313
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:50,939
Now, all the way back down.

314
00:22:51,148 --> 00:22:56,153
Stretch real hard, and up.
And inhale and exhale.

315
00:23:11,751 --> 00:23:13,502
Dadlink on.

316
00:23:16,672 --> 00:23:18,507
Locate Dad.

317
00:23:19,216 --> 00:23:21,385
<i>Hiya, slugger</i>

318
00:23:23,053 --> 00:23:25,847
<i>Locating Dad now</i>

319
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:32,145
<i>Exact coordinates
will be pinpointed in 11 seconds</i>

320
00:23:32,395 --> 00:23:35,189
<i>10, nine</i>

321
00:23:35,648 --> 00:23:38,275
<i>eight, seven</i>

322
00:23:41,737 --> 00:23:42,696
<i>Four</i>

323
00:23:42,905 --> 00:23:46,533
Mr. President, if the government
spends more money than it takes in...

324
00:23:46,742 --> 00:23:48,368
...it goes into debt.

325
00:23:49,452 --> 00:23:51,788
Excuse me, Mr. President.
It's the Dadlink.

326
00:23:51,955 --> 00:23:54,916
- Dadlink?
- It's my personal communication system...

327
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:56,876
...to my son. It's a prototype.

328
00:23:57,502 --> 00:23:58,753
<i>Yes, Richie What is it?</i>

329
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,296
Hi, Dad. What you doing?

330
00:24:00,463 --> 00:24:04,300
I'm discussing economic policy
with the president. Is this important?

331
00:24:04,466 --> 00:24:07,553
<i>Well, Dad, I think I'm getting a zit</i>

332
00:24:08,011 --> 00:24:09,680
What do you think?

333
00:24:10,097 --> 00:24:11,598
<i>Could we talk later?</i>

334
00:24:11,765 --> 00:24:15,101
<i>Oh Sure, Dad I'm sorry
I'll see you tonight</i>

335
00:24:15,435 --> 00:24:17,770
<i>- Bye
- See you.</i>

336
00:24:17,937 --> 00:24:19,230
Bye.

337
00:24:19,689 --> 00:24:22,692
Congratulations on the zit, sir.

338
00:24:22,859 --> 00:24:24,568
Thank you, Cadbury.

339
00:24:36,163 --> 00:24:39,040
And I'll collect you after school, as usual.

340
00:24:39,207 --> 00:24:42,043
- Good hunting, sir.
- Thank you, Cadbury.

341
00:24:45,338 --> 00:24:47,924
Let's move on to case study number 12.

342
00:24:48,132 --> 00:24:50,426
Your company is in dire straits.

343
00:24:50,801 --> 00:24:54,430
Sales are down 50 percent
due to stiff price competition.

344
00:24:54,638 --> 00:24:57,349
Dividends are falling.
Stockholders are demanding...

345
00:24:57,516 --> 00:24:59,726
...you step down
as chairman of the board.

346
00:24:59,935 --> 00:25:02,312
Now, here's your problem.

347
00:25:02,479 --> 00:25:05,440
How do you rally the board
of directors to your side...

348
00:25:05,607 --> 00:25:08,193
...and stave off impending bankruptcy?

349
00:25:08,651 --> 00:25:10,194
Reynolds?

350
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:15,825
I'll have my secretary
get back to you on that one.

351
00:25:16,826 --> 00:25:20,079
Ellsworth, how would you
get the board on your side?

352
00:25:22,164 --> 00:25:23,624
Bribe someone.

353
00:25:24,374 --> 00:25:27,294
Sit down, Ellsworth.

354
00:25:27,961 --> 00:25:30,130
Reginald, what would you do?

355
00:25:30,505 --> 00:25:32,465
What would I do? Simple.

356
00:25:32,882 --> 00:25:35,635
I'd float a rumor
we're the object of a takeover bid.

357
00:25:35,843 --> 00:25:38,346
And as soon as our stock went up, I'd sell.

358
00:25:38,554 --> 00:25:41,849
That's not only unethical,
Reginald, it's illegal.

359
00:25:42,725 --> 00:25:44,518
I'm only 12.

360
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:47,688
I can't be held legally responsible.

361
00:25:48,564 --> 00:25:50,190
Good point.

362
00:25:53,193 --> 00:25:56,654
Rich, are you and Cuthbert
passing notes again?

363
00:25:56,863 --> 00:25:59,532
- No, sir.
- Cuthbert?

364
00:26:15,005 --> 00:26:17,757
Capital appreciation
is all well and good...

365
00:26:17,924 --> 00:26:20,218
...but not without
a sound growth strategy.

366
00:26:20,552 --> 00:26:23,972
Well, I've only got one word
to say to you: pork bellies.

367
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,723
So, what do you think, Rich?

368
00:26:25,973 --> 00:26:30,061
I think all we ever talk about is money.
We should be having fun.

369
00:26:31,312 --> 00:26:32,688
Money is fun.

370
00:26:32,855 --> 00:26:36,191
All I'm saying is, I'm wondering
if you can come this weekend...

371
00:26:36,358 --> 00:26:37,693
...and hang out.

372
00:26:38,068 --> 00:26:40,779
- Hang out?
- Yeah, like normal kids.

373
00:26:40,946 --> 00:26:44,282
You know, you're really acting weird,
Richie. Anyway, no can do.

374
00:26:44,491 --> 00:26:47,702
I promised my dad I'd go to Tokyo
for a hostile takeover.

375
00:26:47,994 --> 00:26:52,165
- Ellsworth?
- Sorry, trustees' meeting.

376
00:26:52,373 --> 00:26:56,293
Watch your rear, Ellsworth.
First rule of defense.

377
00:26:57,419 --> 00:27:03,300
This is a cappuccino. I asked for a decaf
caffe latte, you incompetent imbecile!

378
00:27:03,467 --> 00:27:05,719
If you can't do the job, you...

379
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:12,100
First rule of defense, Reg.
Always watch your rear.

380
00:27:21,233 --> 00:27:23,986
Sir, your Latin tutorial has been
moved back an hour.

381
00:27:24,153 --> 00:27:26,238
That gives you time
for a spot of polo.

382
00:27:26,447 --> 00:27:28,073
Then on to your tax law seminar.

383
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,617
oh, and this coming weekend, big treat.

384
00:27:30,826 --> 00:27:35,038
You and your parents are flying to London
to take tea with Her Majesty.

385
00:27:36,915 --> 00:27:38,625
Is something amiss, sir?

386
00:27:38,791 --> 00:27:40,918
My friends are too busy
to hang out...

387
00:27:41,085 --> 00:27:43,004
...and now I'm too busy to hang out.

388
00:27:43,171 --> 00:27:45,798
You must understand
you're being groomed...

389
00:27:45,965 --> 00:27:50,594
...for a life of wealth and responsibility.
Certain sacrifices must be made.

390
00:27:51,553 --> 00:27:53,805
Sacrifices.

391
00:27:56,308 --> 00:27:59,311
Cadbury, I'm changing my schedule.
Bascomb?

392
00:27:59,477 --> 00:28:00,687
- Sir.
- Make a right.

393
00:28:00,854 --> 00:28:03,690
- Yes, sir.
- You...

394
00:28:03,856 --> 00:28:05,942
Come on, pitcher.

395
00:28:08,152 --> 00:28:10,780
You're supposed to hit the ball.

396
00:28:10,988 --> 00:28:12,406
Come on, Gloria.

397
00:28:12,615 --> 00:28:14,783
Cool car.

398
00:28:14,992 --> 00:28:18,120
Hey, guys. Check it out.

399
00:28:18,328 --> 00:28:19,955
Master Richie, please.

400
00:28:20,122 --> 00:28:23,416
You can't play with those children.
I must protest.

401
00:28:23,583 --> 00:28:26,294
Cadbury, chill. I'll be fine.

402
00:28:26,711 --> 00:28:29,881
But they probably haven't
even been vaccinated.

403
00:28:30,673 --> 00:28:32,800
Hi, guys. I'm Richie.

404
00:28:32,967 --> 00:28:36,971
- We know who you are.
- What, no chopper?

405
00:28:37,179 --> 00:28:39,515
Dad hardly ever lets me
take the helicopter.

406
00:28:39,682 --> 00:28:42,351
oh, no chopper to go to school?

407
00:28:43,852 --> 00:28:45,896
- What are you doing?
- I was wondering...

408
00:28:46,063 --> 00:28:48,648
...if maybe I can play with you guys?
- Play?

409
00:28:54,529 --> 00:28:56,489
Not!

410
00:28:56,864 --> 00:28:58,658
Come on. Let me hit.

411
00:28:58,866 --> 00:29:00,910
You probably couldn't
hit a beach ball.

412
00:29:01,077 --> 00:29:02,328
I can hit off of you.

413
00:29:06,999 --> 00:29:10,961
You think you're so hot.
Put your money where your mouth is.

414
00:29:11,169 --> 00:29:15,006
- You mean bet?
- Yeah. Five says she puts you away.

415
00:29:15,215 --> 00:29:17,717
Five? How about 10?

416
00:29:18,509 --> 00:29:22,221
okay. Seems a little steep,
but 10,000 it is.

417
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:28,102
No, no, no. Not 10,000.
Ten dollars.

418
00:29:29,228 --> 00:29:31,605
Ten dollars. okay.

419
00:29:32,147 --> 00:29:35,025
I was going to McDonald's
with this money.

420
00:29:36,276 --> 00:29:38,361
- Dust him.
- No problem.

421
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:40,530
Mr. Fancy Pants is going down.

422
00:29:40,739 --> 00:29:44,075
Master Richie, I do think it unseemly
in the extreme...

423
00:29:44,242 --> 00:29:47,203
...for you to take
these... These children's money.

424
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:51,207
What are you doing?
Asking the old guy for batting tips?

425
00:29:51,916 --> 00:29:54,627
Hit a touchdown, Master Richie.

426
00:29:58,672 --> 00:30:01,133
Come on, Gloria. Right over the plate.

427
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:03,593
- Strike him out, Gloria.
- Come on, Gloria.

428
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,053
Come on, Gloria!

429
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:07,931
- Hey, batter, batter, batter.
- Easy money. Come on.

430
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:11,100
- Strike him out.
- You got it, Gloria.

431
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:13,394
Fire it in there.

432
00:30:19,525 --> 00:30:22,069
This is a piece of cake.

433
00:30:23,987 --> 00:30:27,157
We got the money in the bag.
Let's go. Come on.

434
00:30:29,784 --> 00:30:32,787
- Burn it in.
- Come on, Gloria.

435
00:30:37,458 --> 00:30:41,962
oh, yes, Master Richie! Yes!

436
00:30:42,338 --> 00:30:44,923
- Yes! Yes!
- oh, man.

437
00:30:45,132 --> 00:30:46,842
There goes my lunch money.

438
00:30:47,009 --> 00:30:48,552
Lucky swing, I guess.

439
00:30:48,969 --> 00:30:51,680
I was wondering if you could
come over to my house...

440
00:30:51,847 --> 00:30:55,100
Pee Wee, give him the money.

441
00:30:55,558 --> 00:30:58,061
- I don't want your money.
- I said, take it.

442
00:30:58,353 --> 00:31:00,438
You don't belong here.

443
00:31:08,529 --> 00:31:12,116
Truly a prodigious blow, Master Richie.

444
00:31:46,523 --> 00:31:47,982
Thank you.

445
00:31:48,691 --> 00:31:53,529
oh, perk up. It won't be long before you're
having tea and crumpets with the queen.

446
00:31:53,696 --> 00:31:55,698
I'd rather eat a hot dog at Wrigley.

447
00:31:55,865 --> 00:31:57,700
So would I, son, so would I.

448
00:31:58,033 --> 00:32:01,412
oh, Richard, you're not
seriously considering...

449
00:32:01,578 --> 00:32:03,830
...giving the queen the Smellmaster?

450
00:32:03,997 --> 00:32:06,666
Why not, Regina?
I think she'd get a kick out of it.

451
00:32:06,917 --> 00:32:10,003
Anything to take her mind off
those children of hers.

452
00:32:12,046 --> 00:32:14,590
Security check's complete, sir.

453
00:32:14,757 --> 00:32:17,093
I hope you and your family
have a great time.

454
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:19,845
Thank you, Mr. Ferguson, thank you.

455
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:25,768
- Cadbury?
- Madam?

456
00:32:25,934 --> 00:32:28,145
What's bothering Richie?

457
00:32:28,562 --> 00:32:32,732
He tried to make friends
with some children yesterday.

458
00:32:32,899 --> 00:32:35,610
It wasn't a great success.

459
00:32:36,361 --> 00:32:39,906
- The poor dear.
- Might I make a suggestion, madam?

460
00:32:40,073 --> 00:32:42,575
- Anything.
- Why not let Master Richie...

461
00:32:42,742 --> 00:32:47,621
...stay here? Young gentlemen are apt
to find royal functions a trifle boring.

462
00:32:47,788 --> 00:32:52,042
Whereas here, I could provide
a busy schedule of distractions.

463
00:32:53,001 --> 00:32:56,922
Cadbury, you're a genius.
I'll go tell Richie.

464
00:33:04,262 --> 00:33:06,222
All aboard.

465
00:33:18,233 --> 00:33:20,152
I could live here.

466
00:33:20,402 --> 00:33:22,737
- It's huge.
- You think they got a pool?

467
00:33:24,322 --> 00:33:26,616
It ain't no house. It's a whole 'hood.

468
00:33:27,784 --> 00:33:30,286
- I've seen bigger.
- Are you kidding?

469
00:33:30,453 --> 00:33:33,539
The place probably has got
its own zip code.

470
00:33:38,711 --> 00:33:40,796
Excuse me, Master Richie.

471
00:33:41,255 --> 00:33:45,759
Sensing you were at a loose end,
I've arranged for a little entertainment.

472
00:33:46,384 --> 00:33:49,679
I'm really not in the mood
for the vienna Boys' Choir today.

473
00:33:49,971 --> 00:33:56,269
Sadly, the choir was unavailable, sir.
But I did make other arrangements.

474
00:33:59,689 --> 00:34:00,981
I don't believe it.

475
00:34:01,148 --> 00:34:02,775
All right, come on.

476
00:34:02,983 --> 00:34:05,569
Thanks, Cadbury, I owe you one.

477
00:34:08,655 --> 00:34:10,657
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, rich man.

478
00:34:10,824 --> 00:34:13,076
- Just checking out your crib, here.
- Crib?

479
00:34:13,243 --> 00:34:17,205
I believe that's street slang
for "home," sir. An idiom.

480
00:34:17,372 --> 00:34:19,374
Who you calling an idiom?

481
00:34:20,166 --> 00:34:22,668
And now, if you wish, sir,
luncheon is served.

482
00:34:22,835 --> 00:34:26,464
All right. Food! I like this place.

483
00:34:26,672 --> 00:34:28,882
I hope you didn't go to too much trouble.

484
00:34:29,049 --> 00:34:33,929
Not at all. I prepared a simple,
yet elegant menu...

485
00:34:37,682 --> 00:34:39,309
It sounds delicious.

486
00:34:39,976 --> 00:34:46,357
However, Master Richie was of the opinion
that his guests deserve a break today.

487
00:34:51,612 --> 00:34:54,823
- You have your own McDonald's?
- No way!

488
00:34:55,324 --> 00:34:56,992
- Not bad.
- Wow.

489
00:34:57,159 --> 00:34:59,578
- This is great.
- I want a Big Mac.

490
00:34:59,745 --> 00:35:02,080
I'm doing an analysis of the secret sauce.

491
00:35:02,455 --> 00:35:06,167
Come on, guys, get him.
Get out of my way.

492
00:35:06,376 --> 00:35:09,545
- Nice shot.
- I'll be right back.

493
00:35:09,796 --> 00:35:11,255
Come on.

494
00:35:11,422 --> 00:35:12,840
It's called the Dadlink.

495
00:35:13,007 --> 00:35:16,677
It's practically the only way I talk
to my dad. He's away a lot.

496
00:35:16,844 --> 00:35:19,346
I know what you mean.
My dad lives in California.

497
00:35:19,555 --> 00:35:22,349
If we didn't e-mail,
I'd probably never talk to him.

498
00:35:23,308 --> 00:35:25,894
Give me the ball. Come on.

499
00:35:26,061 --> 00:35:28,355
Man, he'd like this place, though.

500
00:35:28,563 --> 00:35:30,273
Must be cool to have everything.

501
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,233
So you guys wanna play, or what?

502
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,570
Hey, I got an idea.
Wanna try the Kiddipult?

503
00:35:35,945 --> 00:35:37,196
The Kiddipult?

504
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:08,559
- Unbelievable!
- That was so cool!

505
00:36:08,726 --> 00:36:10,394
That was great!

506
00:36:10,561 --> 00:36:14,398
That was nothing.
You guys wanna play tag?

507
00:36:15,107 --> 00:36:16,566
- Tag?
- Tag?

508
00:36:32,832 --> 00:36:36,919
In the gentle hand of the gardener
lies the hand of God.

509
00:36:37,836 --> 00:36:39,963
- Are you a Sagittarius?
- No, madam.

510
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:42,007
- Pisces?
- No, madam.

511
00:36:42,174 --> 00:36:44,759
- Leo?
- No. No, I'm a Taurus.

512
00:36:44,926 --> 00:36:48,012
I knew it. The bull.

513
00:36:48,179 --> 00:36:51,724
- Correct, madam.
- oh, look, don't call me madam, okay.

514
00:36:51,891 --> 00:36:55,519
I don't like the connotation.
My name's Diane.

515
00:36:55,686 --> 00:36:57,646
of course, Diane.

516
00:36:57,813 --> 00:37:00,315
And how about you?
You got a first name?

517
00:37:00,482 --> 00:37:03,193
- of course.
- And?

518
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,903
- Herbert.
- Herb.

519
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:09,032
No, it's Herbert.
I'm not a seasoning.

520
00:37:20,042 --> 00:37:23,629
Do I detect a rising fire sign,
Herbert?

521
00:37:25,756 --> 00:37:29,176
You, Diane, are a Capricorn.

522
00:37:29,343 --> 00:37:31,720
Hey, how did you know that?

523
00:37:32,345 --> 00:37:34,848
Yeah!

524
00:37:36,391 --> 00:37:38,268
oh, yeah!

525
00:37:39,018 --> 00:37:40,812
Yeah!

526
00:37:42,146 --> 00:37:44,982
Man, this is the best day of my life!

527
00:37:47,443 --> 00:37:51,155
- Me too.
- The day's not over yet.

528
00:37:51,697 --> 00:37:53,323
You mean, there's more?

529
00:37:54,283 --> 00:37:56,618
- Your own roller coaster.
- Check it out.

530
00:37:56,785 --> 00:37:59,496
- Awesome!
- It's so big!

531
00:37:59,663 --> 00:38:01,331
That is cool.

532
00:38:01,539 --> 00:38:04,792
My dad gave me this last Christmas.
It's pretty intense.

533
00:38:04,959 --> 00:38:09,547
- Yeah, I just ate.
- You always just ate.

534
00:38:11,298 --> 00:38:15,594
Now, their plane ought to be
about right here by now.

535
00:38:19,765 --> 00:38:25,186
Just about time for me to move
into a much bigger office.

536
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:30,900
<i>Roger that, center. Billion Dollar One,
over and out.</i>

537
00:38:36,072 --> 00:38:40,200
Would you take over for a while, darling?
I think I'd like some coffee.

538
00:38:40,367 --> 00:38:44,246
Don't go sneaking into those chocolates.
They're reserved for the queen.

539
00:38:44,413 --> 00:38:48,250
Regina, I'm dieting.
The last thing I want is chocolate.

540
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:56,716
Where are those chocolates?

541
00:38:57,008 --> 00:38:59,677
Up, up, up.

542
00:39:03,931 --> 00:39:06,433
Chocolates. Chocolates.

543
00:39:07,392 --> 00:39:09,561
Smellmaster.

544
00:39:13,732 --> 00:39:16,401
<i>Handkerchiefs Hand-embroidered</i>

545
00:39:17,277 --> 00:39:20,113
<i>Marble egg Fabergé</i>

546
00:39:20,613 --> 00:39:23,241
<i>Trinitrotoluene</i>

547
00:39:25,451 --> 00:39:27,661
I'll tell him you called. Thank you.

548
00:39:27,828 --> 00:39:29,538
open it.

549
00:39:32,416 --> 00:39:36,962
Darling, this one doesn't have a tag.
Do you know what it is?

550
00:39:37,129 --> 00:39:41,174
- No, I don't.
- The Smellmaster says it's trinitrotoluene.

551
00:39:41,341 --> 00:39:45,595
And if my memory serves me right,
trinitrotoluene is the proper name for...

552
00:39:46,762 --> 00:39:48,848
TNT!

553
00:39:51,308 --> 00:39:54,853
- Good God, Regina. It's a bomb.
- Get rid of it!

554
00:40:17,458 --> 00:40:19,460
Richie, this is great!

555
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:38,436
To the new chairman of Rich Industries:

556
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:42,148
Me.

557
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:47,194
Well, it's been a slice. Maybe I'll see you
around sometime, huh?

558
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:50,030
Yes, you never can tell.

559
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:54,826
When you get off the embalming fluid,
give me a call, Herbert.

560
00:40:59,872 --> 00:41:02,250
- Thanks a lot for coming over.
- No problem.

561
00:41:02,416 --> 00:41:05,336
Don't forget. Baseball next Wednesday.

562
00:41:05,503 --> 00:41:06,879
- 3:30.
- I'll be there.

563
00:41:07,046 --> 00:41:09,256
Hey, wait. What about our
hundred bucks?

564
00:41:09,423 --> 00:41:12,342
- I said, forget about that, Tony.
- What hundred bucks?

565
00:41:12,509 --> 00:41:16,471
The penguin-looking dude said he'd give us
$ 100 for coming to play with you.

566
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:21,059
- Gloria, I didn't know that...
- Hey, look. Nobody has to pay us anything.

567
00:41:21,226 --> 00:41:23,353
End of story.

568
00:41:23,728 --> 00:41:26,439
See you later, Richie.
We had a great time.

569
00:41:42,412 --> 00:41:45,040
Master Rich, I really am
most dreadfully sorry.

570
00:41:45,248 --> 00:41:47,584
- Mr. Cadbury!
- Excuse me.

571
00:41:58,469 --> 00:42:00,888
Master Rich...

572
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:04,808
What?

573
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:07,310
It's your parents.

574
00:42:08,645 --> 00:42:10,897
<i>- Dadlink on.
- Hiya, slugger</i>

575
00:42:11,106 --> 00:42:14,067

<i>Dad not found</i>

582
00:42:39,632 --> 00:42:42,009
Mr. van Dough, sir?

583
00:42:42,176 --> 00:42:44,011
<i>Fergie, entrez.</i>

584
00:42:44,178 --> 00:42:48,807
I was just thinking that after I plunder
the Rich family vault...

585
00:42:48,974 --> 00:42:53,770
...I think I'd like to buy a country
somewhere.

586
00:42:53,937 --> 00:42:56,898
Something small, not too ostentatious.

587
00:42:57,107 --> 00:43:00,944
Luxembourg, perhaps, or maybe Ecuador.

588
00:43:02,487 --> 00:43:06,282
Sir, it seems we have a slight problem.

589
00:43:08,826 --> 00:43:11,787
The boy wasn't on the plane, sir.

590
00:43:12,288 --> 00:43:15,958
Feculent fool! After all of my
careful planning...

591
00:43:18,001 --> 00:43:19,920
All right.

592
00:43:22,172 --> 00:43:25,383
I got rid of the king and the queen.

593
00:43:25,967 --> 00:43:31,389
I don't think the boy prince
will be any problem at all.

594
00:43:33,641 --> 00:43:36,018
<i>The plane has been missing
more than 12 hours</i>

595
00:43:36,185 --> 00:43:39,980
<i>But despite the biggest air
and sea search in US naval history</i>

596
00:43:40,147 --> 00:43:43,692
<i>there is still no sign of billionaires
Richard and Regina Rich</i>

597
00:43:44,151 --> 00:43:46,945
<i>missing since the apparent crash
of their plane</i>

598
00:43:47,112 --> 00:43:49,489
They're alive, Cadbury. I know it.

599
00:43:49,698 --> 00:43:53,451
And wherever they are, Master Richie,
I'm sure they're together...

600
00:43:53,618 --> 00:43:55,578
...and happy.

601
00:43:56,454 --> 00:43:59,290
Richard, if we ever get out of this...

602
00:43:59,457 --> 00:44:02,918
...l'm gonna soak for a week
in a vat of oil of olay.

603
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:05,295
Why haven't they found us yet?

604
00:44:05,462 --> 00:44:09,007
Well, probably because
the locator transmitter in the plane...

605
00:44:09,216 --> 00:44:11,510
...is under a mile of water.

606
00:44:11,676 --> 00:44:15,638
Unless we can see a Radio Shack soon,
we can kiss off any chance...

607
00:44:15,805 --> 00:44:17,557
...of getting my Dadlink to work.

608
00:44:17,891 --> 00:44:22,436
There's only one person ruthless enough
to set off a bomb on our plane.

609
00:44:22,603 --> 00:44:25,272
- When I get my fingers...
- We don't know for sure.

610
00:44:25,439 --> 00:44:28,817
oh, Richard, wake up
and smell the seaweed!

611
00:44:28,984 --> 00:44:31,361
You should have fired him years ago.

612
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:34,948
I've never fired anyone in my life.
I don't intend to start now.

613
00:44:35,115 --> 00:44:36,867
But van Dough...

614
00:44:37,409 --> 00:44:39,953
He thought Richie
was on the plane with us.

615
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,415
Regina, we have to survive...

616
00:44:44,582 --> 00:44:47,460
...if only to warn Richie.
His life is in danger.

617
00:44:52,965 --> 00:44:55,426
Ladies and gentlemen...

618
00:44:56,802 --> 00:45:00,055
...before we begin, I'd like to observe
a moment of silence...

619
00:45:00,222 --> 00:45:03,934
...on the tragic passing
of Mr. and Mrs. Rich.

620
00:45:06,102 --> 00:45:10,106
Now, first order of business:

621
00:45:10,773 --> 00:45:13,734
United Tool.

622
00:45:15,111 --> 00:45:17,655
What do you mean, they closed
the factory?

623
00:45:17,821 --> 00:45:20,824
It just happened. My mom
and everyone else got fired.

624
00:45:20,991 --> 00:45:23,160
I didn't know. You gotta believe me.

625
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:26,955
<i>Hey, I'm really sorry about your parents,
but can't you help?</i>

626
00:45:37,381 --> 00:45:39,925
I don't know if I can do this, Cadbury.

627
00:45:40,134 --> 00:45:44,054
Remember this...

628
00:45:44,263 --> 00:45:47,015
- What's that mean?
- It means you have the power...

629
00:45:47,182 --> 00:45:48,934
...of your father inside you.

630
00:45:49,142 --> 00:45:51,478
Kind of like, "Trust the Force, Luke."

631
00:45:53,521 --> 00:45:55,690
Exactly, sir.

632
00:46:05,825 --> 00:46:08,494
It's so hard.

633
00:46:09,495 --> 00:46:10,871
Sir?

634
00:46:13,123 --> 00:46:15,834
Mr. Richard Rich Jr. to see you.

635
00:46:19,337 --> 00:46:22,215
Miss Fairchild, I need those memos done
by 3:00 today.

636
00:46:22,382 --> 00:46:24,467
Yes, sir, Mr. van Dough, sir.

637
00:46:24,676 --> 00:46:29,305
Richie, Richie, Richie, Richie...

638
00:46:29,972 --> 00:46:33,225
Allow me to express my heartfelt
sympathies over your loss.

639
00:46:33,392 --> 00:46:35,978
We all loved your mother and father
very much.

640
00:46:36,311 --> 00:46:38,480
My parents are alive.

641
00:46:39,106 --> 00:46:41,650
I pray nightly that they are.

642
00:46:41,983 --> 00:46:46,446
I want you to know we're doing everything
we can to coordinate the search effort.

643
00:46:46,905 --> 00:46:48,656
Please, have a seat.

644
00:46:58,249 --> 00:47:02,711
- So, what have you come to see me about?
- Well, until my parents come back...

645
00:47:02,878 --> 00:47:04,838
...l've taken a...

646
00:47:05,172 --> 00:47:06,715
Sabbatical, sir.

647
00:47:07,465 --> 00:47:09,843
I've taken a sabbatical from school.

648
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:12,845
You know, so I can be here
and run things.

649
00:47:13,012 --> 00:47:15,890
Run things.

650
00:47:16,057 --> 00:47:20,352
Richie, the job of senior officer...

651
00:47:21,270 --> 00:47:23,022
...of a multi...

652
00:47:24,231 --> 00:47:26,733
National corporation...

653
00:47:27,109 --> 00:47:30,904
...it's very demanding business.

654
00:47:31,822 --> 00:47:35,533
Hours go, well just, way past
your bedtime.

655
00:47:35,742 --> 00:47:39,245
So I think that it's best
to leave this job to...

656
00:47:41,414 --> 00:47:46,085
...an adult who has experience
in these matters. okay?

657
00:47:47,044 --> 00:47:48,295
I don't think so.

658
00:47:49,713 --> 00:47:52,424
By the way, Cadbury,
how much stock do I own?

659
00:47:52,591 --> 00:47:56,052
Until your parents are found, sir,
as the sole heir...

660
00:47:56,219 --> 00:47:58,930
...you own 51 percent of the voting stock.

661
00:47:59,097 --> 00:48:01,975
You're not of legal age
to exercise your voting rights.

662
00:48:02,141 --> 00:48:04,018
But I am, sir.

663
00:48:04,185 --> 00:48:08,564
<i>And under the terms of the Rich estate,
I stand in loco parentis</i>

664
00:48:08,731 --> 00:48:11,984
<i>...and Guardian ad Litem
to Master Richie.</i>

665
00:48:12,151 --> 00:48:17,406
And accordingly, I give him full
proxy power and authority.

666
00:48:19,950 --> 00:48:24,287
And by the way, United Tool stays open.

667
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:26,998
Fine.

668
00:48:29,792 --> 00:48:32,670
Round one to you, sir.

669
00:48:42,971 --> 00:48:47,058
With the losses in our manufacturing
division, this will necessitate...

670
00:48:53,606 --> 00:48:55,149
Sorry.

671
00:48:55,316 --> 00:48:57,944
Will necessitate
some employee downsizing.

672
00:48:58,110 --> 00:49:00,905
Downsizing. You mean fire people.

673
00:49:01,071 --> 00:49:03,949
Well, call it what you will, Richie.

674
00:49:04,116 --> 00:49:05,993
It is our job to cut the fat.

675
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:09,204
Mr. van Dough, my father never
fired anybody.

676
00:49:09,371 --> 00:49:12,290
He always said when
people are secure in their jobs...

677
00:49:12,499 --> 00:49:14,542
...they work harder, happier
and better.

678
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:20,006
So I think if we need to cut the fat,
I say we start right here.

679
00:49:31,058 --> 00:49:32,809
- Good morning.
- Morning.

680
00:49:32,976 --> 00:49:35,270
- Morning. Your messages.
- Morning, Sylvia.

681
00:49:35,437 --> 00:49:37,856
- Morning, Mr. Rich.
- Morning.

682
00:49:38,857 --> 00:49:40,650
Yeah, Marvin, I understand that.

683
00:49:40,817 --> 00:49:44,654
Yes, but if all of our divisions are doing
record-breaking business...

684
00:49:44,862 --> 00:49:47,698
...how come Rich candy bars
are down 12 percent?

685
00:49:47,865 --> 00:49:51,535
oh, come on. Have you ever actually
tasted a Rich bar?

686
00:49:57,666 --> 00:50:01,503
He'll get back to you as soon
as possible, Mr. lacocca. Goodbye.

687
00:50:01,711 --> 00:50:04,964
Richie Rich's office. Yes.

688
00:50:06,841 --> 00:50:08,509
Talk about gumballs.

689
00:50:08,676 --> 00:50:12,471
Richie Rich's office. I'm sorry.
He's not available. He's in conference.

690
00:50:12,638 --> 00:50:15,850
- I'll have him call you.
- Excuse me. We'd like to see Richie.

691
00:50:16,016 --> 00:50:18,560
- And you are?
- Hey, they're free!

692
00:50:18,727 --> 00:50:20,896
- We're his friends.
- We wanna thank him...

693
00:50:21,063 --> 00:50:25,108
...for reopening the factory.
- Mr. Rich is much too busy to see anyone.

694
00:50:25,275 --> 00:50:26,943
But wait, we can...

695
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:28,612
Richie Rich's office.

696
00:50:28,778 --> 00:50:30,321
Hey!

697
00:50:31,114 --> 00:50:33,825
Excuse me! Somebody help!

698
00:50:33,992 --> 00:50:38,120
- I didn't do it! I didn't do it!
- Get Pee Wee. We're going in.

699
00:50:39,163 --> 00:50:40,331
Come on, let's go.

700
00:50:40,498 --> 00:50:43,542
- I didn't do it.
- Are you all right?

701
00:50:45,377 --> 00:50:49,089
- Richie.
- Gloria? Hey, guys.

702
00:50:49,256 --> 00:50:50,590
Close the door.

703
00:50:50,757 --> 00:50:52,926
I'll have to get back to you, Marvin.

704
00:50:53,093 --> 00:50:57,472
Yeah, my new research and development
team just walked in.

705
00:50:57,639 --> 00:50:59,223
- What?
- What?

706
00:50:59,432 --> 00:51:02,727
And finally, after extensive
and exhausting taste testing...

707
00:51:02,935 --> 00:51:05,479
...by my new research
and development team...

708
00:51:05,646 --> 00:51:07,398
- Hi.
- How you doing?

709
00:51:07,565 --> 00:51:12,528
...l've come to the conclusion that we must
increase our nut proportion by 15 percent.

710
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:16,406
We simply cannot let our competition
be nuttier than we are.

711
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:21,828
- Yes.
- That's our idea.

712
00:51:34,298 --> 00:51:35,966
- Come on, guys.
- Excuse me.

713
00:51:36,133 --> 00:51:38,844
Excuse me. Coming through.

714
00:51:43,223 --> 00:51:46,226
All those in favor of my motion?

715
00:51:51,522 --> 00:51:53,816
All opposed?

716
00:52:02,991 --> 00:52:04,534
I hate that kid.

717
00:52:04,701 --> 00:52:08,622
No, no. Clockwise, clockwise.
I said, massage clockwise.

718
00:52:08,788 --> 00:52:11,916
Migraines are bad enough
without your incompetence. Get out!

719
00:52:12,083 --> 00:52:15,086
Yes, sir, Mr. van Dough.

720
00:52:15,711 --> 00:52:20,383
Now, you listen. I want you to put the
revised plan we discussed into action.

721
00:52:20,549 --> 00:52:23,552
And this time, make sure
the gloves come off.

722
00:52:24,219 --> 00:52:28,015
- Gloves, sir?
- It's a metaphor, hamhead.

723
00:52:32,269 --> 00:52:34,020
Well, that's it, honey.

724
00:52:34,187 --> 00:52:38,274
We're out of Perrier. Caviar's gone,
and there's no more Melba toast.

725
00:52:38,441 --> 00:52:41,110
The only thing we've got left
is a bottle of Dom.

726
00:52:41,277 --> 00:52:45,823
And this little packet of Bubblicious.
Richie's favorite.

727
00:52:47,116 --> 00:52:51,161
He's only 12 years old, Richard.
He's just a boy.

728
00:52:51,328 --> 00:52:55,290
Now, Regina, I'm sure whatever happens,
he's going to be just fine.

729
00:52:59,085 --> 00:53:00,628
- oh, my God!
- What is it?

730
00:53:00,795 --> 00:53:03,256
- We're saved! We're saved!
- What? What? What?

731
00:53:03,423 --> 00:53:07,677
My Louis! Darling, my suitcase.

732
00:53:11,889 --> 00:53:16,143
And when my father gets back, I'm sure
he'll be happy to see what we've done.

733
00:53:16,310 --> 00:53:20,647
The profits from every division
have gone up on a record-breaking rise.

734
00:53:22,399 --> 00:53:26,319
- It doesn't give you the right...
- I'm sorry, but this is police business.

735
00:53:26,486 --> 00:53:29,781
- Herbert Cadbury!
- Yes.

736
00:53:29,947 --> 00:53:31,449
You're under arrest.

737
00:53:31,616 --> 00:53:33,075
- Pardon?
- What is this?

738
00:53:33,242 --> 00:53:36,704
You can't just burst in here.
What is the meaning of this?

739
00:53:36,871 --> 00:53:39,331
We received a tip
and searched the Rich mansion.

740
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:42,960
Bomb parts, detonation devices
found in Herbert Cadbury's room.

741
00:53:43,126 --> 00:53:45,087
- Preposterous.
- You're under arrest...

742
00:53:45,253 --> 00:53:47,047
...for Mr. and Mrs. Rich's murder.

743
00:53:47,255 --> 00:53:51,259
I don't know what you're talking about.
Don't worry. I'm sure it's a mistake.

744
00:53:51,426 --> 00:53:53,594
Cadbury! Cadbury!

745
00:53:53,970 --> 00:53:56,556
Richie, police have him now.
Best stay here.

746
00:53:56,848 --> 00:53:59,809
Do you understand that you can stop
these proceedings?

747
00:53:59,975 --> 00:54:03,771
Richie, is it true that Mr. Cadbury
planted a bomb on your parents' jet?

748
00:54:03,937 --> 00:54:05,647
Do you think they were murdered?

749
00:54:05,814 --> 00:54:08,567
- How do you feel?
- What's the future of United Tool?

750
00:54:08,734 --> 00:54:12,279
- Richie!
- Are your parents alive?

751
00:54:12,779 --> 00:54:16,282
- Mr. van Dough!
- We are deeply saddened by this tragic turn.

752
00:54:16,449 --> 00:54:18,701
I'd like to believe in
Cadbury's innocence.

753
00:54:18,868 --> 00:54:22,288
- But evidence points in the other direction.
- Mr. van Dough.

754
00:54:22,455 --> 00:54:27,585
of course, my main concern is that
poor Richie survives this terrible episode.

755
00:54:27,793 --> 00:54:32,089
And having his best interests at heart,
I have petitioned Superior Court...

756
00:54:32,297 --> 00:54:35,509
...to become the boy's legal guardian.

757
00:54:35,675 --> 00:54:37,427
That's all for right now. Thanks.

758
00:54:37,636 --> 00:54:40,638
<i>The court has granted legal guardianship
of Richie Rich</i>

759
00:54:40,805 --> 00:54:44,100
<i>to Laurence Van Dough,
trusted friend of the Rich family</i>

760
00:54:44,267 --> 00:54:48,187
<i>Meanwhile, bail has been denied
to accused murderer, Herbert Cadbury</i>

761
00:54:48,354 --> 00:54:52,608
<i>And believing Cadbury may have had
accomplices, Mr Van Dough dismissed</i>

762
00:54:52,816 --> 00:54:54,818
<i>all employees of the Rich family</i>

763
00:54:55,444 --> 00:54:59,489
<i>The Southside community adoption service
released figures for the last year...</i>

764
00:55:05,787 --> 00:55:09,040
My makeup case.

765
00:55:09,207 --> 00:55:13,294
My dresses, my Karl Lagerfeld,
my Bill Blass.

766
00:55:13,461 --> 00:55:17,381
My tuxedo. Now we can throw
a dinner party.

767
00:55:18,424 --> 00:55:21,426
Well, what do we have...?
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

768
00:55:21,593 --> 00:55:23,971
Here's something we can use.

769
00:55:24,179 --> 00:55:27,641
Don't you think this is an odd time
to start shaving your legs?

770
00:55:27,849 --> 00:55:32,478
Don't you understand? This may be the very
thing that will save us. The very thing.

771
00:55:32,645 --> 00:55:35,606
Yes, yes!

772
00:55:35,773 --> 00:55:38,818
Richard, darling, you've been
too long at sea.

773
00:55:39,276 --> 00:55:41,487
<i>Dad not found</i>

774
00:55:42,071 --> 00:55:44,490
<i>Dad not found</i>

775
00:55:44,865 --> 00:55:47,743
<i>Dad not found</i>

776
00:55:47,910 --> 00:55:50,537
Excuse me, Richie.

777
00:55:50,704 --> 00:55:54,124
- Right under that archway.
- What are you doing? What is that?

778
00:55:54,290 --> 00:55:58,544
- Security camera. For your protection.
- My protection?

779
00:55:58,711 --> 00:56:02,256
Yeah. And until further notice...

780
00:56:02,423 --> 00:56:05,926
...l'm afraid I can't let you leave
the grounds of the estate.

781
00:56:06,093 --> 00:56:09,388
After what happened to your parents,
we can't take any chances.

782
00:56:09,805 --> 00:56:11,390
What about the company?

783
00:56:11,682 --> 00:56:15,268
You won't be going
to the office anymore, Richie.

784
00:56:16,686 --> 00:56:21,858
Mr. van Dough will be running
the office from now on.

785
00:56:22,525 --> 00:56:25,778
- Nice doggy.
- Come on, Dollar.

786
00:56:39,416 --> 00:56:43,670
Right there, camera 23.
That position's good. Lock it down.

787
00:56:48,633 --> 00:56:51,135
I don't believe this.

788
00:56:51,302 --> 00:56:54,847
It's like I'm a prisoner, Dollar,
in my own home.

789
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:02,521
I'm gonna go have a talk with
Mr. van Dough. You stay here. Good dog.

790
00:57:09,527 --> 00:57:14,407
Well, sir, things have turned out
just the way we planned.

791
00:57:14,699 --> 00:57:17,285
You planned, sir.
Just the way you planned.

792
00:57:17,451 --> 00:57:22,498
Well, not exactly. The vault.
Where is the vault?

793
00:57:22,665 --> 00:57:27,336
There must be billions hidden in there.
You're head of security. Where is the vault?

794
00:57:27,502 --> 00:57:31,673
I told you, sir. That's one thing
I was never privy to.

795
00:57:33,383 --> 00:57:37,011
What about the rotund
Professor Keenbean?

796
00:57:37,178 --> 00:57:41,265
Claims he doesn't know.

797
00:57:41,474 --> 00:57:46,520
<i>And you believe him, you idiot
The man is a lying, disgusting toad</i>

798
00:57:46,687 --> 00:57:48,605
<i>About the butler, sir</i>

799
00:57:48,772 --> 00:57:54,444
<i>I've arranged it so Mr Cadbury will soon
be so overcome with guilt and remorse</i>

800
00:57:55,278 --> 00:57:58,323
...he's going to hang himself in his cell.

801
00:58:11,669 --> 00:58:13,629
To the lab.

802
00:58:14,296 --> 00:58:18,258
- They're gonna kill Cadbury?
- They're gonna make it look like a suicide.

803
00:58:18,425 --> 00:58:22,554
- We have to do something. Bust him out...
- Here it is.

804
00:58:22,721 --> 00:58:27,350
- What is it?
- This baby here is the ultimate corrosive.

805
00:58:27,517 --> 00:58:32,230
Don't touch it! I call it
"hydrocloricdioxynucleocarbonium."

806
00:58:32,396 --> 00:58:36,817
The name needs work.
But it'll eat through a Buick.

807
00:58:37,484 --> 00:58:39,445
or...

808
00:58:40,195 --> 00:58:44,491
- Prison bars.
- Exactly.

809
00:58:54,751 --> 00:58:58,004
Welcome to your worst nightmare.

810
00:59:02,591 --> 00:59:03,884
Gin.

811
00:59:07,846 --> 00:59:09,264
Sorry.

812
00:59:09,431 --> 00:59:13,351
What kind of deal is that? I don't need
the money tomorrow, I need it today.

813
00:59:13,518 --> 00:59:16,354
You don't understand. She's my mother.

814
00:59:20,024 --> 00:59:23,694
- Excuse me, sir.
- What do you want?

815
00:59:24,403 --> 00:59:29,366
- Well, what do you want?
- I want you to give this to my uncle.

816
00:59:29,575 --> 00:59:32,077
- Who's your uncle?
- Herbert Cadbury.

817
00:59:32,411 --> 00:59:36,081
Cadbury, huh? Let me see this.

818
00:59:39,834 --> 00:59:41,836
- What's this?
- It's Latin.

819
00:59:42,212 --> 00:59:45,381
Latino? I thought he was English.

820
00:59:45,798 --> 00:59:48,926
- What's this?
- very special toothpaste.

821
00:59:51,262 --> 00:59:54,223
He has really sensitive teeth.

822
00:59:58,727 --> 01:00:01,188
- You got 10 minutes to do whatever.
- Thank you.

823
01:00:01,396 --> 01:00:03,732
Get to it.

824
01:00:28,004 --> 01:00:31,382
I'm getting out of here. Let's go. Hurry.

825
01:00:33,509 --> 01:00:37,930
Thank heavens. My teeth
were starting to grow fur.

826
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:45,521
Talk about extra-strength tartar control.

827
01:00:51,568 --> 01:00:53,111
"Life in danger."

828
01:00:56,781 --> 01:00:59,742
"Use toothpaste on bars."

829
01:00:59,951 --> 01:01:04,872
Life in danger? Really!
How melodramatic.

830
01:01:12,796 --> 01:01:16,967
Help! officer! Help me! Help!

831
01:01:35,818 --> 01:01:40,280
Never mess with a man
with sensitive teeth.

832
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:08,431
- Cadbury?
- Richie.

833
01:02:09,682 --> 01:02:13,394
- You're okay.
- I've been worried sick.

834
01:02:13,561 --> 01:02:17,732
I do beg your pardon, sir. All that emotion.
Quite out of order.

835
01:02:17,898 --> 01:02:19,400
Got caught up in the moment.

836
01:02:19,567 --> 01:02:21,026
- Cadbury.
- Yes, sir.

837
01:02:21,193 --> 01:02:22,861
- Shut up.
- Thank you, sir.

838
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:24,571
Look.

839
01:02:26,615 --> 01:02:30,285
- I'm so sorry. I hadn't heard.
- No, look. They only found the plane.

840
01:02:30,744 --> 01:02:34,581
No bodies, no life raft.
Mom and Dad are alive. I know it.

841
01:02:34,748 --> 01:02:37,458
- And the Dadlink?
- We can't go back to the house.

842
01:02:37,792 --> 01:02:41,212
But I have another idea. Come on.

843
01:02:42,004 --> 01:02:43,714
Looking radical in those clothes.

844
01:02:43,881 --> 01:02:46,467
Thank God I was able to hold on to
my underwear.

845
01:02:53,015 --> 01:02:57,644
So Master Richie helped Cadbury
escape from jail.

846
01:02:57,811 --> 01:03:01,564
I knew that! I know everything!
Everything, do you hear?

847
01:03:01,731 --> 01:03:04,317
What I know about you
will put you both in jail!

848
01:03:04,484 --> 01:03:09,155
Really? In that case, I'm afraid that
we're just gonna have to kill you.

849
01:03:10,489 --> 01:03:14,618
I don't know that much. What do I know?
Who'd believe me anyway?

850
01:03:14,785 --> 01:03:17,454
I do believe there is one thing
you do know...

851
01:03:17,621 --> 01:03:20,540
...which will be very helpful to me.
- Forget it!

852
01:03:20,707 --> 01:03:26,462
I'm not helping you. Nothing you do can
make me talk! Do you hear? Nothing!

853
01:03:34,887 --> 01:03:36,514
Good morning, madam.

854
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:38,766
Cadbury, come on.

855
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:47,023
This is it, right here.

856
01:03:51,486 --> 01:03:53,488
- Hello?
- Gloria, it's me.

857
01:03:53,655 --> 01:03:55,573
Richie?

858
01:03:55,740 --> 01:03:59,035
Whoa. Look who's slumming.

859
01:04:00,327 --> 01:04:03,122
Gloria, I need to use your computer.
It's important.

860
01:04:03,289 --> 01:04:05,165
Come on in.

861
01:04:11,796 --> 01:04:13,840
Well, here goes.

862
01:04:19,637 --> 01:04:21,389
oh, no.

863
01:04:21,556 --> 01:04:24,433
- Wait. Wait a minute.
- What are you doing? What is it?

864
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:28,103
It may just do it. Wait, wait, wait.

865
01:04:33,942 --> 01:04:36,528
It's working?

866
01:04:37,445 --> 01:04:40,031
Let's just hope the power holds out.

867
01:04:40,198 --> 01:04:44,327
- Hope Richie hasn't given up the search.
- Richie? of course he won't.

868
01:04:44,494 --> 01:04:46,746
- I'm gonna go get changed.
- Changed?

869
01:04:46,913 --> 01:04:53,043
Yes, of course, darling. There's no way
I'm going to be rescued looking like this.

870
01:04:58,382 --> 01:05:02,302
- Just a few more seconds. It should be in.
- I like this look on you.

871
01:05:02,469 --> 01:05:05,513
If I didn't know better,
I'd think you were almost normal.

872
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:08,850
- Thanks. I think.
- No, I mean it.

873
01:05:09,017 --> 01:05:11,978
I used to think you were just
some spoiled rich kid.

874
01:05:12,144 --> 01:05:14,563
But now you're not so bad.

875
01:05:14,730 --> 01:05:17,942
Yeah. Likewise.

876
01:05:18,108 --> 01:05:21,028
No, no, please, madam.
Madam, no, no, no!

877
01:05:21,195 --> 01:05:23,363
That really isn't...

878
01:05:25,157 --> 01:05:28,868
- Thank you, madam.
- I told you, don't call me madam.

879
01:05:29,035 --> 01:05:31,621
Forgive me, Diane.

880
01:05:32,038 --> 01:05:33,873
Richie did it! He's in!

881
01:05:36,667 --> 01:05:38,961
<i>Hiya, slugger</i>

882
01:05:47,719 --> 01:05:50,180
What the heck?

883
01:05:51,806 --> 01:05:54,851
Mike, get me Ferguson.

884
01:05:58,730 --> 01:06:01,482
Come on, professor. Play nice.

885
01:06:01,649 --> 01:06:04,068
- Think I'm enjoying this?
- Yes.

886
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:07,071
But anyway...

887
01:06:07,655 --> 01:06:10,574
You told me what this machine
could do to a person.

888
01:06:10,741 --> 01:06:15,120
How would you like to spend the rest
of your life as a bedpan?

889
01:06:15,287 --> 01:06:18,456
You've gotta believe me!
I don't know where the vault is!

890
01:06:18,623 --> 01:06:23,961
- And even if I did it, it wouldn't help you!
- Ferguson, wait.

891
01:06:24,962 --> 01:06:28,341
- Tell me why, professor.
- Because the lock is voice-activated...

892
01:06:28,507 --> 01:06:30,968
...and only Mr. and Mrs. Rich
can open it!

893
01:06:31,135 --> 01:06:35,681
Unfortunately, Mr. and Mrs. Rich
have been detained permanently.

894
01:06:36,932 --> 01:06:40,143
So come up with another way
for me to get into that vault.

895
01:06:40,310 --> 01:06:42,479
Yes, but...

896
01:06:46,357 --> 01:06:48,276

897
01:06:49,193 --> 01:06:50,736
What?

898
01:06:51,028 --> 01:06:52,321
Sir, I have a situation.

899
01:06:52,655 --> 01:06:54,240
Handle it.

900
01:06:55,950 --> 01:06:57,493
I'm sorry. Hungry, professor?

901
01:06:58,369 --> 01:07:01,163
- You're despicable.
- Enjoy.

this is a good idea, sir?

Well, I'm wanted for attempted murder,
escaping from jail, blowing up an aircraft...

921
01:08:19,820 --> 01:08:22,739
...breaking and entering
sounds right up my alley.

922
01:08:22,906 --> 01:08:25,742
- Let's kick some butt, shall we?
- Let's.

923
01:08:34,041 --> 01:08:36,919
Well, that's it. It's all up to Richie now.

924
01:08:37,086 --> 01:08:39,546
Well, then, everything is fine.

925
01:08:39,713 --> 01:08:41,423
- Richie never lets us down.
- No.

926
01:08:41,590 --> 01:08:43,467
He never would.

927
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:46,845
Wait, darling, do you hear that?

928
01:08:48,388 --> 01:08:50,181
Yes. Yes, it is!

929
01:08:50,348 --> 01:08:54,227
- It's a plane! It's a plane!
- oh, my God! Richard, we're saved!

930
01:08:54,394 --> 01:08:55,853
oh, Richie!

931
01:08:56,020 --> 01:08:57,647
- Heroic boy!
- over here! Hello?!

932
01:08:57,813 --> 01:09:00,399
- Lovely son! Hello!
- Hello?! Plane!

933
01:09:10,742 --> 01:09:13,119
If any of you wanna turn back,
now's the time.

934
01:09:13,286 --> 01:09:15,580
No way. We're with you, Richie.

935
01:09:20,918 --> 01:09:23,004
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

936
01:09:38,101 --> 01:09:39,352
Yes.

937
01:09:40,728 --> 01:09:42,355
The package has arrived.

938
01:09:42,939 --> 01:09:43,981
Splendid.

939
01:09:47,109 --> 01:09:48,235
Wait for my signal.

940
01:10:01,164 --> 01:10:03,875
Good grief. Manure?

941
01:10:04,042 --> 01:10:06,794
- Hey! It's all we could find.
- Yeah.

942
01:10:07,462 --> 01:10:09,422
very well. Load.

943
01:10:14,218 --> 01:10:17,554
All right. I'm in position.
You guys all set?

944
01:10:18,972 --> 01:10:20,307
Eminently.

945
01:10:22,643 --> 01:10:23,977
I've got a target.

946
01:10:25,103 --> 01:10:26,438
Ready.

947
01:10:27,814 --> 01:10:29,733
Wait for it.

948
01:10:30,275 --> 01:10:31,484
Wait for it.

949
01:10:33,444 --> 01:10:34,695
Fire!

950
01:10:39,825 --> 01:10:41,076
We missed.

951
01:10:41,577 --> 01:10:42,703
Reload! Reload!

952
01:10:47,416 --> 01:10:48,667
<i>This is Nash</i>

953
01:10:48,834 --> 01:10:50,836
Nash, I didn't hear that. Come back.

954
01:10:51,253 --> 01:10:52,379
This is Nash.

955
01:10:52,545 --> 01:10:54,130
Fire two!

956
01:10:55,632 --> 01:10:57,258
Somebody's throwing...

957
01:10:59,677 --> 01:11:01,512
- Yes!
- Yeah!

958
01:11:01,679 --> 01:11:04,098
Come back, Nash. Say again.

959
01:11:05,015 --> 01:11:07,768
- What'd you hit him with?
- Don't ask.

960
01:11:07,935 --> 01:11:09,186
<i>Nash?</i>

961
01:11:09,853 --> 01:11:11,772
<i>- Nash?
- Talk to him.</i>

962
01:11:11,939 --> 01:11:13,231
Come in, Nash.

963
01:11:14,232 --> 01:11:16,735
Yeah. This is Nash.

964
01:11:16,902 --> 01:11:18,194
False alarm.

965
01:11:18,570 --> 01:11:21,573
Everything's slicker than snot
on a doorknob.

966
01:11:22,865 --> 01:11:24,450
Well, I heard it in prison.

967
01:11:24,617 --> 01:11:25,952
Roger that.

968
01:11:26,118 --> 01:11:30,206
I think those Twinkies
are starting to rot his brain.

969
01:11:35,752 --> 01:11:37,421
Spoils of war, man.

970
01:12:02,861 --> 01:12:04,112
Flashlight.

971
01:12:04,988 --> 01:12:08,158
- Are you okay?
- You wouldn't believe what they did to me.

972
01:12:08,325 --> 01:12:11,244
- It was inhuman. No! Wait!
- Where's van Dough?

973
01:12:11,411 --> 01:12:14,288
He got a phone call and ran out.
He's not nice person.

974
01:12:14,455 --> 01:12:18,834
Cadbury and I have to get up to my room.
We need a diversion to get past the guard.

975
01:12:19,001 --> 01:12:20,878
I think I can whip up something.

976
01:12:21,045 --> 01:12:22,755
- Gloria, you go with him.
- okay.

977
01:12:22,921 --> 01:12:24,506
- Guys, let's do it.
- Come on!

978
01:12:29,177 --> 01:12:30,846
Go, go, go.

979
01:12:37,810 --> 01:12:39,854
This should do the trick. Come.

980
01:12:46,569 --> 01:12:49,279
Hey, this is it. Come on.

981
01:12:56,536 --> 01:12:59,664
<i>Me! Like your own wife and children,
dozens of them!</i>

982
01:12:59,831 --> 01:13:02,125
This way, Gloria.
over here. Right there.

983
01:13:02,292 --> 01:13:05,128
- Give that a turn to the right.
- What are we doing?

984
01:13:05,294 --> 01:13:07,797
Well, what they need is a diversion.

985
01:13:07,964 --> 01:13:10,966
This is a combination
of laundry detergent...

986
01:13:11,133 --> 01:13:14,094
...dish-washing detergent
and bubble bath. Take that off.

987
01:13:14,261 --> 01:13:17,389
I call it "Sudsational."

988
01:13:20,225 --> 01:13:21,601
What in the?

989
01:13:22,269 --> 01:13:23,937
Bubbles?

990
01:13:28,691 --> 01:13:30,067
What the heck?

991
01:13:34,488 --> 01:13:36,365
Hey, you guys.

992
01:13:37,157 --> 01:13:41,245
Mr. Zullo, we have a problem
with the front fountain.

993
01:13:41,411 --> 01:13:45,165
- Then turn it off, you idiot.
- You heard the man. Go.

994
01:13:45,582 --> 01:13:46,917
Kill the cameras now.

995
01:14:06,143 --> 01:14:08,562
You guys go on ahead.
I'll be just a second.

996
01:14:08,729 --> 01:14:10,063
okay.

997
01:14:19,113 --> 01:14:20,656
My inventions!

998
01:14:20,865 --> 01:14:22,700
- What is it?
- I don't know!

999
01:14:24,952 --> 01:14:26,996
We did it, Mom. They're in there.

1000
01:14:27,162 --> 01:14:30,415
All right. Richie, Herbert,
you're on your own.

1001
01:14:33,835 --> 01:14:36,796
Cadbury, look. It's still working.

1002
01:14:37,589 --> 01:14:39,716
<i>Dad found</i>

1003
01:14:39,883 --> 01:14:42,385
Wait a minute. This isn't right.

1004
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:45,012
It says Dad's here.

1005
01:14:45,179 --> 01:14:46,764
Welcome home, Richie.

1006
01:14:47,807 --> 01:14:49,850
You were even quicker than I thought.

1007
01:14:53,228 --> 01:14:56,481
- Mom! Dad!
- our other guests should be arriving...

1008
01:14:56,815 --> 01:14:58,233
...any moment.

1009
01:15:03,446 --> 01:15:05,782
Hey, man, are you nervous or something?

1010
01:15:05,949 --> 01:15:08,493
- What are you talking about?
- Did you fart?

1011
01:15:08,659 --> 01:15:10,870
- No.
- Man, you cut the cheese.

1012
01:15:11,037 --> 01:15:14,248
- Whoever smelt it, dealt it.
- Whoever denied it, supplied it.

1013
01:15:18,419 --> 01:15:20,754
- What is that?
- I don't know.

1014
01:15:30,430 --> 01:15:31,639
Sir.

1015
01:15:32,724 --> 01:15:36,060
- Got them.
- outstanding. Bring them in.

1016
01:15:36,936 --> 01:15:40,356
- Richie, darling, I'm so worried about you.
- Thank you.

1017
01:15:40,523 --> 01:15:44,276
- Why are you doing all this?!
- Yes, Laurence, what are you after?

1018
01:15:45,027 --> 01:15:46,361
The vault, Richard.

1019
01:15:46,653 --> 01:15:48,322
The Rich family vault.

1020
01:15:48,488 --> 01:15:51,449
- Is that what this is all about?
- Yes. Yes, the vault.

1021
01:15:51,616 --> 01:15:54,035
- Where is it?
- There.

1022
01:15:55,662 --> 01:15:57,455
- Where?
- out there!

1023
01:16:04,795 --> 01:16:06,297
Mount Richmore?

1024
01:16:07,715 --> 01:16:10,134
Your vault is an entire mountain?

1025
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:13,345
- Well...
- You really are filthy rich, aren't you?

1026
01:16:15,180 --> 01:16:17,307
You take me to that vault right now.

1027
01:16:18,058 --> 01:16:19,350
Just to make sure...

1028
01:16:19,517 --> 01:16:22,895
...l'll have Mr. Ferguson watch
Master Richie until we get back.

1029
01:16:23,062 --> 01:16:24,647
No! Don't hurt Richie!

1030
01:16:26,315 --> 01:16:28,776
If you two cooperate, I promise...

1031
01:16:29,819 --> 01:16:32,321
...no one will get hurt.
- I'll be okay, Mom.

1032
01:16:33,781 --> 01:16:35,282
Shall we?

1033
01:16:38,618 --> 01:16:42,414
I will not be held responsible
if that weasel steals my inventions...

1034
01:16:42,580 --> 01:16:45,583
...if they fall into the wrong hands...
Robo-Bee!

1035
01:16:48,503 --> 01:16:50,630
My little pretty...

1036
01:16:50,838 --> 01:16:52,590
Let's go! Let's go!

1037
01:16:52,757 --> 01:16:54,091
Come on! Move!

1038
01:16:55,050 --> 01:16:56,677
After all this family's
done...

1039
01:16:56,844 --> 01:17:00,430
I guess I won't be winning
that Employee of the Month award.

1040
01:17:00,764 --> 01:17:02,557
- very funny.
- Keep moving.

1041
01:17:02,724 --> 01:17:04,351
- Move!
- All right, all right.

1042
01:17:05,644 --> 01:17:07,604
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1043
01:17:07,771 --> 01:17:09,439
Hey, watch it!

1044
01:17:14,068 --> 01:17:16,070
All right. Everybody in.

1045
01:17:16,237 --> 01:17:19,198
- No. I'm not going in there.
- No way. I'm not going in.

1046
01:17:20,241 --> 01:17:23,202
- Everybody in!
- Sure. Whatever you say. You're the boss.

1047
01:17:23,619 --> 01:17:25,412
St. Peter on a Popsicle stick...

1048
01:17:25,579 --> 01:17:27,873
...he's gonna scramble their molecules.

1049
01:17:28,206 --> 01:17:31,543
Don't panic. Don't panic, Keenbean,
you'll think of something.

1050
01:17:31,710 --> 01:17:34,462
What?! What are you gonna think of?

1051
01:17:36,798 --> 01:17:38,466
We're going!

1052
01:17:44,388 --> 01:17:46,223
- Careful...
- Let's go! Let's go!

1053
01:17:47,099 --> 01:17:48,642
All right, watch your heads.

1054
01:17:52,896 --> 01:17:55,732
- Jerk! Let me out!
- Let's see if this thing works!

1055
01:18:00,069 --> 01:18:02,905
- I'm stuck!
- It's the fat man!

1056
01:18:08,411 --> 01:18:11,288
- Keenbean?
- Keenbean! He's here.

1057
01:18:15,584 --> 01:18:17,169
Nice try, professor.

1058
01:18:17,336 --> 01:18:20,088
But you're gonna have to
do better than that!

1059
01:18:22,382 --> 01:18:23,591
Let's...

1060
01:18:23,758 --> 01:18:26,052
...play a little game...

1061
01:18:26,219 --> 01:18:28,262
...with your little friends!

1062
01:18:31,224 --> 01:18:32,683
Ignition!

1063
01:18:41,608 --> 01:18:45,487
Thirty more seconds and you won't
recognize your little friends!

1064
01:18:50,116 --> 01:18:52,619
Don't worry, Richie!
I've got him covered!

1065
01:18:52,785 --> 01:18:54,120
Save us, professor.

1066
01:18:56,622 --> 01:18:58,833
- No!
- Somebody get us out!

1067
01:19:01,377 --> 01:19:03,128
I can't reach the machines!

1068
01:19:12,637 --> 01:19:14,013
Fly, my beauty!

1069
01:19:14,180 --> 01:19:17,141
Fly like you've never flown before!

1070
01:19:33,990 --> 01:19:35,116
Eureka!

1071
01:19:35,534 --> 01:19:37,369
Careful, Richie! The Cementia!

1072
01:19:37,994 --> 01:19:39,579
- Thank you, professor.
- Yes.

1073
01:19:39,746 --> 01:19:41,456
- Cadbury...
- Master Richie!

1074
01:19:42,081 --> 01:19:44,375
I've gotta get to Mom and Dad.

1075
01:19:46,168 --> 01:19:47,503
Wait!

1076
01:20:07,647 --> 01:20:09,315
oh, yes.

1077
01:20:10,858 --> 01:20:12,360
Look at that.

1078
01:20:13,194 --> 01:20:14,403
Finally.

1079
01:20:14,695 --> 01:20:16,655
All right, now. open it.

1080
01:20:16,864 --> 01:20:20,033
<i>- Hello, vault.
- Hiya, boss!</i>

<i>Please state the code for voice check</i>

1082
01:20:22,953 --> 01:20:24,496
open it now. open it!

1083
01:20:47,059 --> 01:20:49,895
<i>- Code accepted
- Thank you, Beavis and Butthead.</i>

1084
01:21:15,001 --> 01:21:16,795
This is incredible!

1085
01:21:16,962 --> 01:21:18,755
This is amazing!

1086
01:21:19,422 --> 01:21:21,549
This is... This is...

1087
01:21:21,758 --> 01:21:22,967
This is junk!

1088
01:21:23,885 --> 01:21:25,094
Junk?

1089
01:21:25,678 --> 01:21:27,596
Bronze dog bones? What?

1090
01:21:28,305 --> 01:21:32,559
Accordions?
Baby pictures, tricycles, kites?

1091
01:21:35,604 --> 01:21:36,813
Bowling trophies?

1092
01:21:36,980 --> 01:21:39,441
- You remember that, darling?
- our first date.

1093
01:21:41,776 --> 01:21:43,319
What is all of this crap?

1094
01:21:43,486 --> 01:21:45,530
These are our priceless possessions.

1095
01:21:45,697 --> 01:21:47,073
Where are the gold bars...

1096
01:21:47,240 --> 01:21:52,119
...the diamonds, negotiable bearer bonds,
the money? Where's the money?!

1097
01:21:52,286 --> 01:21:54,038
In banks, where else?

1098
01:21:54,205 --> 01:21:56,332
- And the stock market, real estate...
- No.

1099
01:21:56,498 --> 01:21:58,459
Is this a joke? This is not right.

1100
01:21:58,625 --> 01:22:02,963
Are you telling me there is not one
single solitary gold bar or emerald...

1101
01:22:03,130 --> 01:22:05,966
...or thousand-dollar bill
in this entire mountain?

1102
01:22:06,132 --> 01:22:09,135
I'm sorry, Laurence,
but that's not what we treasure.

1103
01:22:09,969 --> 01:22:11,512
Shoot them now, please.

1104
01:22:14,474 --> 01:22:17,476
What's the matter, Mr. van Dough?
Can't do it yourself?

1105
01:22:17,643 --> 01:22:19,812
- Richie, get out of here!
- It's okay, Mom.

1106
01:22:19,979 --> 01:22:22,022
I don't think he has the guts
to shoot.

1107
01:22:22,189 --> 01:22:23,607
Richie! No!

1108
01:22:24,316 --> 01:22:27,861
Generally, you're right,
but on this occasion...

1109
01:22:28,028 --> 01:22:29,821
...I think I'll make an exception.

1110
01:22:32,532 --> 01:22:33,783
Cool.

1111
01:22:42,083 --> 01:22:43,709
You're a dead man!

1112
01:22:49,214 --> 01:22:50,632
Let's get out of here!

1113
01:22:52,092 --> 01:22:54,302
- Lock him in, Dad!
- Good idea, son!

1114
01:22:54,469 --> 01:22:58,431
<i>- Close vault.
- Closing vault now Have a nice day</i>

1115
01:23:08,691 --> 01:23:09,984
This way!

1116
01:23:28,751 --> 01:23:30,378
Up the ramp, quick.

1117
01:23:31,087 --> 01:23:32,672
oh, my God.

1118
01:23:33,547 --> 01:23:36,383
- It's all right, honey. Don't look down!
- oh, Jesus.

1119
01:23:58,070 --> 01:23:59,071
Don't look down!

1120
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:00,656
I won't, darling.

1121
01:24:01,407 --> 01:24:02,825
Get down!

1122
01:24:04,201 --> 01:24:05,786
Down, down. Everybody down!

1123
01:24:05,994 --> 01:24:07,746
- He's trying to kill us!
- I know!

1124
01:24:20,299 --> 01:24:22,301
I got you now.

1125
01:24:24,970 --> 01:24:26,347
Stay down!

1126
01:24:27,931 --> 01:24:29,600
Quick! Up we go!

1127
01:24:29,766 --> 01:24:31,935
Not me, you imbecile! Them!

1128
01:24:33,353 --> 01:24:34,938
Beg your pardon.

1129
01:24:36,398 --> 01:24:37,816
That wasn't so difficult.

1130
01:24:39,317 --> 01:24:41,027
- Come on.
- Richard, I'm afraid!

1131
01:24:41,194 --> 01:24:43,613
But you're the bravest woman
I've ever known.

1132
01:24:43,780 --> 01:24:47,033
- Now up you go.
- Cut the crap and stop pushing!

1133
01:24:50,202 --> 01:24:51,620
Shit!

1134
01:25:25,652 --> 01:25:28,113
- All right, Richie, come on.
- Come on, Richie!

1135
01:25:29,948 --> 01:25:31,449
Good boy, son.
Good boy.

1136
01:25:31,616 --> 01:25:33,868
Now, don't look down.

1137
01:25:42,751 --> 01:25:44,169
Hang on!

1138
01:25:47,422 --> 01:25:48,673
Richard!

1139
01:25:56,180 --> 01:25:57,890
- Richard!
- Mom!

1140
01:26:12,362 --> 01:26:14,990
I've got you! I've got you!
Grab Richie's hand!

1141
01:26:16,241 --> 01:26:17,659
- I got her!
- No!

1142
01:26:17,826 --> 01:26:20,161
- Don't let go of me.
- We won't let you go.

1143
01:26:21,204 --> 01:26:24,540
Now, I won't let you go, dear.

1144
01:26:27,626 --> 01:26:30,379
- I'll swing you into my mouth.
- In your mouth?

1145
01:26:30,546 --> 01:26:32,381
- Your mouth?
- It's large enough.

1146
01:26:34,383 --> 01:26:35,717
- Ready?
- okay.

1147
01:26:35,884 --> 01:26:37,010
one.

1148
01:26:37,219 --> 01:26:38,929
- I can't hold her! Hurry!
- Two.

1149
01:26:39,096 --> 01:26:40,722
- She's slipping!
- once more.

1150
01:26:40,889 --> 01:26:42,140
Three!

1151
01:26:45,977 --> 01:26:47,895
- You okay?
- I made it!

1152
01:26:48,062 --> 01:26:49,730
All right. You're next.

1153
01:26:55,152 --> 01:26:56,570
Give me that!

1154
01:27:04,202 --> 01:27:06,246

01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:21,802
I look like Michael Jackson!

Where are they?

01:27:58,461 --> 01:27:59,921
Thank God!

1165
01:28:01,339 --> 01:28:03,257
Not so fast.

1166
01:28:16,436 --> 01:28:18,939
Please. Please. Help me!

oh, my God! Help! Please help! Help!

1168

Dad, I know how you feel
about firing people, but...

1169
01:28:25,862 --> 01:28:28,322
In this case, I think
we can make an exception.

1170
01:28:28,489 --> 01:28:30,825
Mr. van Dough, you're fired!

1171
01:28:30,992 --> 01:28:32,326
Fine, I'm fired...

1172
01:28:37,748 --> 01:28:39,708
Well done, Master Richie!

1173
01:28:39,875 --> 01:28:41,335
Well done!

01:28:43,503 --> 01:28:45,255
...everything all right?

1176
01:28:45,422 --> 01:28:47,632
Yes, madam...

1177
01:28:49,175 --> 01:28:51,386
...in a manner of speaking.

1178
01:28:59,185 --> 01:29:01,645
- Go get them, Richie!
- Come on, Richie!

1179
01:29:02,104 --> 01:29:03,939
- Come on, you can do it!
- Richie!

Come on, Richie!

1181
01:29:06,525 --> 01:29:08,944
Come on, kill that ball!

1182
01:29:09,111 --> 01:29:13,073
- Right down the middle!
- Come on! This guy can't hit!

1183
01:29:13,281 --> 01:29:14,908
Knock it out the park!

1184

Well done! That's the ticket!

1185

Good hit.

1186
01:29:34,676 --> 01:29:36,177
Shut up!

1187
01:29:36,720 --> 01:29:38,721
Aren't you gonna throw it back?

1188
01:29:44,727 --> 01:29:47,688
Hey, screw. Fetch.

1189
01:29:54,778 --> 01:29:56,863
Not bad, coach.

You're not so bad yourself, madam.

Don't call me that.

1192
01:30:01,660 --> 01:30:03,453
Richie, you're all right.

1193
01:30:03,620 --> 01:30:05,330
Likewise.

1194
01:30:18,425 --> 01:30:20,552
I must say, Regina...

1195
01:30:20,761 --> 01:30:24,097
