00:00:39,804 --> 00:00:41,181
It is time.

4
00:01:17,133 --> 00:01:18,593
It's beautiful, isn't it?

5
00:01:19,678 --> 00:01:21,263
I'm Ikaris.

6
00:01:22,264 --> 00:01:23,598
I'm Sersi.

7
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,263
It's coming! Run!

8
00:02:05,912 --> 00:02:06,912
Father!

9
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:08,002
Run!

10
00:02:54,064 --> 00:02:55,065
Good fight.

11
00:02:55,523 --> 00:02:56,566
You, too.

12
00:04:39,127 --> 00:04:40,921
Thank you, Ajak.

13
00:06:25,442 --> 00:06:26,818
Shit.

14
00:06:30,363 --> 00:06:33,199
Excuse me. Excuse me.

15
00:06:51,885 --> 00:06:53,720
I know I'm late, Charlie.

16
00:06:58,934 --> 00:07:00,769
"In this broad Earth of ours,

17
00:07:00,936 --> 00:07:04,272
"Amid the measureless
grossness and the slag,

18
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:07,651
"Enclosed and safe
within its central heart,"

19
00:07:07,817 --> 00:07:10,403
"Nestles the seed Perfection."

20
00:07:11,238 --> 00:07:14,157
The poet's hope and optimism in humanity

21
00:07:14,324 --> 00:07:16,743
echoes our recent universal victory,

22
00:07:16,826 --> 00:07:18,787
the return of half our population...

23
00:07:18,954 --> 00:07:20,114
And, thank God, there she is.

24
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:23,375
Our brilliant museum scientist, Ms. Sersi,

25
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:24,751
the person who will be

26
00:07:24,918 --> 00:07:26,920
and was always supposed to be

27
00:07:27,002 --> 00:07:28,420
giving you your presentation today.

28
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:31,424
Thank you, Mr. Whitman.
Sorry I'm late, everyone.

29
00:07:31,591 --> 00:07:33,425
Today, we'll be learning
about the importance

30
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:36,471
of apex predators in a balanced ecosystem.

31
00:07:37,806 --> 00:07:38,807
Poetry?

32
00:07:38,974 --> 00:07:40,368
I completely
ran out of things to say,

33
00:07:40,392 --> 00:07:42,519
and these kids make me nervous.

34
00:07:42,686 --> 00:07:44,896
Well, I thought you were
very charming, Professor.

35
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,523
See you tonight.

36
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:49,317
Ooh! "See you tonight."

37
00:07:49,401 --> 00:07:51,069
All right, settle down.

38
00:07:53,572 --> 00:07:54,573
So...

39
00:07:55,031 --> 00:07:57,450
who can tell me
what an apex predator is?

40
00:07:57,909 --> 00:07:59,619
Animals that hunt their prey for food.

41
00:07:59,786 --> 00:08:00,954
Very good.

42
00:08:01,121 --> 00:08:03,456
Apex predators do hunt
their prey for food,

43
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,791
like all predators.

44
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:06,793
But one thing that sets them apart

45
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,546
is that there are no other
animals in their habitat

46
00:08:09,629 --> 00:08:11,590
strong enough to hunt them.

47
00:08:12,841 --> 00:08:14,175
Who can give me an example?

48
00:08:14,342 --> 00:08:15,343
Lions.

49
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,262
- Wolves.
- Correct.

50
00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:21,099
Earthquake.

51
00:08:23,602 --> 00:08:25,520
Get down. Get down!

52
00:08:25,687 --> 00:08:28,356
It's an earthquake, everyone.
Get down! Under the tables!

53
00:08:29,691 --> 00:08:32,694
Let me help you.
Don't worry, it'll pass soon.

54
00:08:40,744 --> 00:08:42,662
It's all right. Come here.

55
00:08:44,581 --> 00:08:46,791
You're all right. You're all right.

56
00:09:29,876 --> 00:09:31,294
I like this song.

57
00:09:31,461 --> 00:09:32,587
Me, too.

58
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:34,965
Do you wanna dance?

59
00:09:35,924 --> 00:09:37,092
Wait, what the hell?

60
00:09:38,051 --> 00:09:39,261
Your hand!

61
00:09:40,011 --> 00:09:43,848
You've had too much to drink. I gotta go.

62
00:09:48,979 --> 00:09:53,400
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

63
00:09:53,566 --> 00:09:58,572
<i>♪ Happy birthday, dear Dane ♪</i>

64
00:09:58,738 --> 00:10:02,701
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

65
00:10:02,867 --> 00:10:04,786
- Hip, hip!
- Hooray!

66
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,461
Is this from the Middle Ages?

67
00:10:13,545 --> 00:10:14,838
It has your family crest.

68
00:10:15,046 --> 00:10:17,299
It must have cost a fortune.

69
00:10:17,674 --> 00:10:19,301
I'm a good eBay bidder.

70
00:10:19,384 --> 00:10:20,385
Thank you.

71
00:10:21,052 --> 00:10:22,345
Happy birthday.

72
00:10:25,932 --> 00:10:28,852
So, have you given any more thought

73
00:10:28,935 --> 00:10:30,604
to us moving in together?

74
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:32,939
Yeah, I... I thought about it.

75
00:10:34,107 --> 00:10:36,109
I can't move in with you.

76
00:10:36,276 --> 00:10:38,111
Yeah. Mm-hmm.
Thought you'd say that.

77
00:10:38,278 --> 00:10:39,321
I'm sorry.

78
00:10:39,404 --> 00:10:41,781
And I think I know why.

79
00:10:43,742 --> 00:10:45,160
Are you a wizard?

80
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,661
What?

81
00:10:47,037 --> 00:10:48,830
Yeah, like Doctor Strange.

82
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:49,915
No. I'm...

83
00:10:50,081 --> 00:10:51,350
I've noticed some unusual things happen

84
00:10:51,374 --> 00:10:52,375
when I'm around you.

85
00:10:52,542 --> 00:10:54,502
Like our water always turns to coffee

86
00:10:54,586 --> 00:10:55,730
whenever the waiter ignores us.

87
00:10:55,754 --> 00:10:56,898
That's your caffeine addiction talking.

88
00:10:56,922 --> 00:10:59,716
- And Sprite says things...
- Mm.

89
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:01,343
like you and your ex-boyfriend

90
00:11:01,426 --> 00:11:02,844
broke up a century ago.

91
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:04,471
She said that?

92
00:11:04,638 --> 00:11:05,847
And he can fly.

93
00:11:06,348 --> 00:11:07,933
He's a pilot.

94
00:11:08,808 --> 00:11:11,061
Get a room, you two.

95
00:11:11,144 --> 00:11:13,605
Can we go now? It's past my bedtime.

96
00:11:17,651 --> 00:11:19,694
Are you really in love?

97
00:11:19,861 --> 00:11:21,112
What if I am?

98
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,448
You better tell him
the truth, then.

99
00:11:23,615 --> 00:11:25,242
I'm working on it.

100
00:11:36,711 --> 00:11:38,213
You guys wanna get pizza?

101
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,631
No, thank you!

102
00:11:41,591 --> 00:11:43,969
He won't live forever, you know.

103
00:11:44,052 --> 00:11:45,053
Move in with him.

104
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:46,930
I live with you.

105
00:11:49,224 --> 00:11:50,350
Dane.

106
00:11:53,186 --> 00:11:54,938
Shit! Is that a Deviant?

107
00:11:55,105 --> 00:11:56,731
Dane, run!

108
00:12:08,201 --> 00:12:09,369
- Sersi?
- Let's go.

109
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:13,456
- What is that thing?
- A Deviant!

110
00:12:13,623 --> 00:12:14,791
You said you killed them all!

111
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:15,959
You told him that?

112
00:12:16,126 --> 00:12:17,711
- You believed me?
- I do now!

113
00:12:24,426 --> 00:12:25,969
What are you doing?

114
00:12:26,136 --> 00:12:27,178
Keep Dane safe!

115
00:12:27,345 --> 00:12:29,222
Sersi, wait! What?

116
00:12:37,689 --> 00:12:38,815
You're fine, dude.

117
00:12:38,982 --> 00:12:40,108
Sprite!

118
00:12:45,322 --> 00:12:47,240
No. Stairs.

119
00:13:24,235 --> 00:13:26,947
Run! Go! Go!

120
00:13:27,113 --> 00:13:28,490
- Go!
- Come on!

121
00:13:36,164 --> 00:13:37,540
It knows where we are!

122
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:38,792
How?

123
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,919
I don't know!

124
00:13:41,878 --> 00:13:42,879
Sprite!

125
00:13:48,969 --> 00:13:49,970
Sprite!

126
00:14:09,155 --> 00:14:10,240
Ikaris!

127
00:14:11,866 --> 00:14:13,326
Evening, ladies.

128
00:14:15,161 --> 00:14:16,246
Watch out!

129
00:14:32,429 --> 00:14:33,722
Wizard.

130
00:14:37,517 --> 00:14:38,602
Sorry.

131
00:14:59,831 --> 00:15:01,708
Did it just heal itself?

132
00:15:21,102 --> 00:15:22,312
Ikaris.

133
00:15:23,688 --> 00:15:25,982
It's good to see you.

134
00:15:26,441 --> 00:15:28,276
It's good to see you, too, Sprite.

135
00:15:34,574 --> 00:15:36,284
I'm Dane.

136
00:15:36,451 --> 00:15:37,869
Hello, Dane.

137
00:15:38,411 --> 00:15:40,580
Well, I guess you must be the pilot.

138
00:15:54,052 --> 00:15:57,221
We're Eternals,
from a planet called Olympia.

139
00:15:57,973 --> 00:16:00,892
We came here 7,000 years ago on the <i>Domo,</i>

140
00:16:01,058 --> 00:16:04,479
our starship, to protect
humans from the Deviants.

141
00:16:05,438 --> 00:16:07,941
We thought we killed them all
five centuries ago,

142
00:16:08,024 --> 00:16:09,651
but now they're back.

143
00:16:12,112 --> 00:16:13,172
Look, if you don't
want to move in with me,

144
00:16:13,196 --> 00:16:14,197
you could just say.

145
00:16:14,364 --> 00:16:15,782
Dane, this is serious.

146
00:16:15,949 --> 00:16:17,534
Oh, I know. I'm just still getting

147
00:16:17,617 --> 00:16:18,977
over the fact you're not a wizard.

148
00:16:19,494 --> 00:16:21,264
I was hoping you could
change me into a giraffe.

149
00:16:21,288 --> 00:16:22,932
I always wanted to be
a giraffe when I was a kid.

150
00:16:22,956 --> 00:16:25,250
It's too bad I can't change
sentient beings.

151
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:27,017
You would have made a very cute giraffe.

152
00:16:31,923 --> 00:16:33,967
Why didn't you guys help fight Thanos?

153
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:35,552
Or any war?

154
00:16:35,635 --> 00:16:37,675
Or all the other terrible things
throughout history?

155
00:16:37,846 --> 00:16:38,847
We were instructed

156
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:40,241
not to interfere in any human conflicts

157
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:41,450
unless Deviants were involved.

158
00:16:41,474 --> 00:16:42,684
Why?

159
00:16:42,851 --> 00:16:46,646
If we'd protected humanity
from everything

160
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:48,064
for 7,000 years,

161
00:16:48,231 --> 00:16:50,317
you'd never have had
the chance to develop

162
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,110
in the way you were meant to.

163
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:56,489
But if the Deviants were
eradicated a long time ago,

164
00:16:56,656 --> 00:16:57,949
why are you still here?

165
00:16:58,116 --> 00:16:59,200
We've been waiting...

166
00:16:59,659 --> 00:17:01,703
to be told we can go home.

167
00:17:02,913 --> 00:17:04,748
So...

168
00:17:05,582 --> 00:17:06,791
Ikaris.

169
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:09,544
The boy who flew too close to the sun.

170
00:17:10,045 --> 00:17:12,380
Sprite made that story up
when we lived in Athens.

171
00:17:12,547 --> 00:17:14,966
In the fifth century BC?

172
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:16,676
How long were you two together?

173
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,802
5,000 years.

174
00:17:19,721 --> 00:17:21,723
I guess you can call that long-term.

175
00:17:22,891 --> 00:17:24,225
What happened?

176
00:17:24,601 --> 00:17:26,311
He left.

177
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:30,065
I always thought he'd come back, but...

178
00:17:30,565 --> 00:17:32,317
he never did.

179
00:17:32,984 --> 00:17:34,277
So, I moved on.

180
00:17:34,736 --> 00:17:36,112
I'm glad you did.

181
00:17:37,155 --> 00:17:38,156
I'm sorry.

182
00:17:39,616 --> 00:17:41,034
I have to go.

183
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,336
<i>This morning,</i>

184
00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:52,796
<i>an unprecedented global earthquake</i>

185
00:17:52,963 --> 00:17:54,547
<i>swept nation-states across the world,</i>

186
00:17:54,714 --> 00:17:56,758
<i>causing damage and panic.</i>

187
00:17:56,925 --> 00:17:59,511
<i>Many have speculated
its connection with the Blip.</i>

188
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:01,930
<i>The UN has called
for an emergency meeting...</i>

189
00:18:02,097 --> 00:18:04,224
That Deviant healed itself.

190
00:18:05,225 --> 00:18:07,269
They could never do that before.

191
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:11,189
And it was coming after us
instead of humans.

192
00:18:11,273 --> 00:18:12,440
What's going on?

193
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:15,318
I came to check on you
because of the earthquake.

194
00:18:15,485 --> 00:18:17,571
That Deviant is news to me.

195
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:22,367
Something's happening to Earth.

196
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,453
Can't be a coincidence.

197
00:18:26,955 --> 00:18:28,707
We need to find the others.

198
00:18:29,332 --> 00:18:31,293
I haven't seen
some of them for centuries.

199
00:18:31,459 --> 00:18:33,378
I doubt much has changed.

200
00:18:43,597 --> 00:18:46,391
I'm sorry I hurt you, Sersi.

201
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,898
But we need to stick together.

202
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,360
And once I know you're safe,
I'll leave you alone.

203
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,655
Let's go to Ajak first.

204
00:19:01,615 --> 00:19:03,491
She'll know what to do.

205
00:19:07,329 --> 00:19:09,039
You hear that, Sprite?

206
00:19:09,789 --> 00:19:11,708
Family reunion.

207
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:13,585
It's about time.

208
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,974
Hey, that one was mine!
Oh, never mind.

209
00:19:37,067 --> 00:19:38,276
Do not fear.

210
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:41,613
Quickly, inside the gate!

211
00:21:03,194 --> 00:21:04,321
Ajak.

212
00:21:05,405 --> 00:21:06,489
Arishem.

213
00:21:07,324 --> 00:21:10,493
We continue to keep Babylon
safe from the Deviants.

214
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:13,163
More people have come to seek refuge.

215
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:16,082
It is now the largest city on Earth.

216
00:21:16,249 --> 00:21:18,001
The Eternals serving their missions

217
00:21:18,084 --> 00:21:19,085
across the galaxies

218
00:21:19,252 --> 00:21:20,962
will learn from your success.

219
00:21:21,379 --> 00:21:22,505
Thank you.

220
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:28,762
I respect your grand design, Arishem.

221
00:21:29,846 --> 00:21:33,558
But I have noticed something
special about this planet.

222
00:21:35,685 --> 00:21:38,980
And I fear that maybe
this time the cost may...

223
00:21:39,147 --> 00:21:41,858
Do not become
attached to this planet.

224
00:21:42,025 --> 00:21:45,862
You must focus on the true purpose
of your mission.

225
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,782
I understand.

226
00:21:49,991 --> 00:21:51,826
I will not let you down.

227
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:17,644
Phastos.

228
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:20,689
Did you go to the party
last night like I told you to?

229
00:22:20,855 --> 00:22:21,856
The party, yeah.

230
00:22:22,023 --> 00:22:23,583
- Yeah, it was...
- He worked all night.

231
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:24,943
Who was talking to you?

232
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,194
Get a life.

233
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:28,446
- And where is Sersi?
- Late as usual.

234
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:29,906
I'm sorry, but I have something

235
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:32,450
very exciting to show you, okay?

236
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:34,452
Wait till you see this.

237
00:22:38,248 --> 00:22:39,249
What is it?

238
00:22:39,416 --> 00:22:40,959
It's an engine.

239
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:44,170
It moves steam from
high pressure to low pressure.

240
00:22:44,337 --> 00:22:46,131
Uh, it'll help them till their fields

241
00:22:46,214 --> 00:22:47,382
at an incredibly fast rate.

242
00:22:47,757 --> 00:22:48,925
It's gonna freak them out.

243
00:22:49,342 --> 00:22:51,928
I mean, they only have had
the wheel 1,000 years, so...

244
00:22:53,179 --> 00:22:54,973
You know, we could do that thing

245
00:22:55,056 --> 00:22:57,142
where you use your mind to control them

246
00:22:57,225 --> 00:22:58,369
and then they could do it quicker.

247
00:22:58,393 --> 00:22:59,644
Ajak, you listening to this?

248
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:02,647
Phastos, this steam...

249
00:23:02,814 --> 00:23:04,816
- Engine. It's a steam engine.
- It's too soon.

250
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,401
And there she is.

251
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:08,278
What did I miss?

252
00:23:08,528 --> 00:23:12,449
Nothing. Just the screams
of my deep disappointment.

253
00:23:12,616 --> 00:23:14,409
I am sure
you have something simpler.

254
00:23:14,492 --> 00:23:15,535
Simple.

255
00:23:15,702 --> 00:23:18,496
Okay, let's see. Uh...

256
00:23:18,622 --> 00:23:21,583
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you

257
00:23:22,918 --> 00:23:24,252
the plow.

258
00:23:25,253 --> 00:23:27,213
'Cause that's what it does.

259
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,673
Plows dirt.

260
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,175
I met another group of settlers

261
00:23:30,258 --> 00:23:32,344
who are building their homes
in the northern fields.

262
00:23:32,427 --> 00:23:33,907
They'll need to plant
their own crops.

263
00:23:34,346 --> 00:23:35,931
- Thanks, Sersi.
- Listen,

264
00:23:36,514 --> 00:23:39,976
humanity may be coming along
slower than some of us want.

265
00:23:40,936 --> 00:23:42,979
But there is no telling what wonders

266
00:23:43,063 --> 00:23:45,690
they will discover as they advance.

267
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:52,280
The wonders of the world await you.

268
00:23:53,323 --> 00:23:56,493
Follow Gilgamesh and Enkidu into battle.

269
00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:00,872
Be forever inspired
by their bravery and strength.

270
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,501
You and your fellow man...

271
00:24:04,668 --> 00:24:07,545
will go on great adventures.

272
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:10,799
And become legends of your own!

273
00:24:15,804 --> 00:24:16,805
I just saw that.

274
00:24:16,972 --> 00:24:18,848
There's so many other chairs, man.

275
00:24:19,015 --> 00:24:20,326
You know,
I could use my powers...

276
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:21,935
Come and have a drink with me.

277
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:23,395
No.

278
00:24:23,561 --> 00:24:25,456
I can't let you go and fight
Deviants on your own.

279
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,649
- We need to guard the city.
- Get out of my way.

280
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,278
I didn't come to this planet
to cower behind walls.

281
00:24:31,778 --> 00:24:35,198
We need to trust Arishem's design
for this planet.

282
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:38,577
- Hmm.
- Thena.

283
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:43,415
It's an honor to fight alongside you.

284
00:24:45,041 --> 00:24:46,293
And you.

285
00:24:49,838 --> 00:24:51,798
My beautiful Makkari.

286
00:24:51,881 --> 00:24:53,049
You're late.

287
00:24:53,133 --> 00:24:57,429
I needed to get
enough artifacts to make a good trade.

288
00:25:01,683 --> 00:25:03,143
Just lie to her.

289
00:25:09,065 --> 00:25:12,152
I can sense vibrations.

290
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:14,029
Even the tiniest movement.

291
00:25:14,487 --> 00:25:18,783
Including your voices when you speak.

292
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:22,871
Did you two just waste my time?

293
00:25:23,246 --> 00:25:25,916
The Emerald Tablet you're searching for...

294
00:25:26,082 --> 00:25:27,083
is a myth!

295
00:25:42,432 --> 00:25:44,100
When humans have conflict,

296
00:25:44,267 --> 00:25:47,646
Ajak tells us not to interfere.

297
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:49,147
Well, she also says

298
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:51,858
that stealing is very, very bad.

299
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:56,696
If you don't tell,

300
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,240
I won't tell.

301
00:25:58,949 --> 00:26:00,033
Deal.

302
00:26:11,544 --> 00:26:13,224
I promise I won't
let my feelings for Sersi

303
00:26:13,296 --> 00:26:14,589
distract me from my mission.

304
00:26:14,756 --> 00:26:16,341
Humans are far from being able

305
00:26:16,424 --> 00:26:18,024
to protect themselves from the Deviants.

306
00:26:18,468 --> 00:26:20,011
We still have much to do.

307
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,682
Your faith in Arishem is strong.

308
00:26:24,266 --> 00:26:25,767
I can feel it.

309
00:26:27,644 --> 00:26:30,105
But you are allowed
to live a life, you know?

310
00:26:30,313 --> 00:26:33,149
Go tell Sersi how you feel.

311
00:26:59,301 --> 00:27:00,510
Try.

312
00:27:01,803 --> 00:27:02,804
Sorry.

313
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:04,139
I'm making a mess.

314
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:08,768
Well, not bad.

315
00:27:12,439 --> 00:27:13,440
See you.

316
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:15,900
Let me help you.

317
00:27:42,928 --> 00:27:44,095
It matches your eyes.

318
00:27:45,597 --> 00:27:46,890
You are very kind.

319
00:27:47,057 --> 00:27:48,975
You're learning
their language now?

320
00:27:49,142 --> 00:27:51,269
If I want to spend more time with you,

321
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:53,396
I need to get to know them.

322
00:27:56,191 --> 00:27:57,734
I am very beautiful.

323
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:00,779
Wait, what did I say?

324
00:28:00,946 --> 00:28:04,157
You said, "I am very beautiful."

325
00:28:07,285 --> 00:28:08,328
You...

326
00:28:11,122 --> 00:28:13,833
You are very beautiful, Sersi.

327
00:28:25,762 --> 00:28:27,305
I'm yours, Sersi,

328
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:29,474
if you'll have me.

329
00:29:14,477 --> 00:29:16,062
I love you, Ikaris.

330
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:20,483
I love you, Sersi.

331
00:29:39,961 --> 00:29:43,798
May the gods hereby bond you in matrimony.

332
00:29:44,674 --> 00:29:46,051
Congratulations.

333
00:30:27,842 --> 00:30:29,135
Hello?

334
00:30:32,806 --> 00:30:33,974
Ajak?

335
00:30:58,707 --> 00:31:00,333
Ajak!

336
00:31:26,401 --> 00:31:28,069
It was a Deviant.

340
00:31:51,968 --> 00:31:54,054
It was the last time I saw her.

341
00:31:55,931 --> 00:31:58,767
Ajak asked me to check on Sersi,

342
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:00,101
so I went to London.

343
00:32:02,312 --> 00:32:04,022
Turned out, both of us were lonely

344
00:32:04,105 --> 00:32:05,732
and we needed each other.

345
00:32:07,525 --> 00:32:09,569
I guess, in her way,

346
00:32:09,736 --> 00:32:12,739
Ajak never stopped
trying to take care of us.

347
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,624
Bye, Ajak.

348
00:32:27,295 --> 00:32:28,672
It's the first time in 7,000 years

349
00:32:28,755 --> 00:32:29,798
one of us has died.

350
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:32,884
I think the Deviant
that attacked us in London

351
00:32:33,051 --> 00:32:34,844
killed Ajak and absorbed her power.

352
00:32:35,011 --> 00:32:36,721
Deviants have never
done that in the past.

353
00:32:36,888 --> 00:32:38,932
It healed itself just like Ajak.

354
00:32:39,432 --> 00:32:42,018
I swear, I almost heard it speak.

355
00:33:09,003 --> 00:33:10,963
- Arishem.
- Sersi.

356
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:12,757
It is almost time.

357
00:33:14,634 --> 00:33:16,845
Sersi! Sersi! Are you okay?

358
00:33:17,429 --> 00:33:18,887
What happened, Sersi?

359
00:33:22,099 --> 00:33:24,519
The sphere that Ajak used
to talk with Arishem,

360
00:33:24,728 --> 00:33:27,230
it came out of her body
and went inside me.

361
00:33:27,396 --> 00:33:29,107
Did you talk with Arishem?

362
00:33:29,733 --> 00:33:31,358
Yes. He said

363
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:33,695
it's almost time.

364
00:33:34,945 --> 00:33:36,655
Can you try talking to him again?

365
00:33:37,616 --> 00:33:38,992
I don't know how.

366
00:33:39,159 --> 00:33:41,036
But she chose you to replace her.

367
00:33:41,703 --> 00:33:42,954
And she gave you the sphere.

368
00:33:43,204 --> 00:33:44,289
Hold on, Sprite.

369
00:33:45,916 --> 00:33:47,356
Are you sure
you talked with Arishem?

370
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,793
What else would it be?

371
00:33:50,045 --> 00:33:51,296
Mahd Wy'ry.

372
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:29,918
Where are the others?

373
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:32,087
We had to split up.

374
00:34:32,712 --> 00:34:34,339
There were more Deviants
than you said.

375
00:34:34,506 --> 00:34:36,266
Well, I'm sure
that was a lot of fun for you.

376
00:34:36,508 --> 00:34:37,717
It was.

377
00:34:39,886 --> 00:34:41,972
Once the others
kill these last Deviants,

378
00:34:42,722 --> 00:34:44,975
we will have eliminated them
all from the planet.

379
00:35:02,367 --> 00:35:04,035
Don't.

380
00:35:05,453 --> 00:35:07,914
We don't interfere in their wars.

381
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,584
This isn't war.

382
00:35:11,001 --> 00:35:12,544
It's genocide.

383
00:35:12,919 --> 00:35:14,963
Their weapons have become too deadly.

384
00:35:16,339 --> 00:35:18,049
Maybe it wasn't such a good idea

385
00:35:18,133 --> 00:35:19,509
helping them advance, Phastos.

386
00:35:19,926 --> 00:35:23,263
Technology is a part of
their evolutionary process, Druig.

387
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:25,110
It's not exactly something
that I can stop.

388
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:27,100
No, you can't. But I can.

389
00:35:27,475 --> 00:35:28,810
Stay strong.

390
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:30,895
It's too late.

391
00:35:31,187 --> 00:35:33,607
- Thena?
- Everyone is going to die.

392
00:35:34,733 --> 00:35:35,734
Are you okay?

393
00:35:37,152 --> 00:35:38,153
Thena?

394
00:35:41,406 --> 00:35:43,992
- Thena? Thena, no!
- Thena!

395
00:36:12,437 --> 00:36:14,731
Don't listen to your head, Thena.

396
00:36:15,732 --> 00:36:17,692
Listen to my voice.

397
00:36:19,402 --> 00:36:21,071
You are safe.

398
00:36:22,197 --> 00:36:24,783
You are loved.

399
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:28,453
You're our Thena.

400
00:36:34,793 --> 00:36:35,961
Hey, Thena!

401
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:38,380
Hey! Stop, stop, stop!

402
00:36:56,648 --> 00:36:58,233
- Is she okay?
- Yeah.

403
00:36:59,526 --> 00:37:00,652
Sersi.

404
00:37:00,819 --> 00:37:01,820
Thena, please.

405
00:37:02,445 --> 00:37:04,447
Come back to us.

406
00:37:04,573 --> 00:37:05,615
Okay.

407
00:37:22,424 --> 00:37:24,551
I thought Mahd Wy'ry was a myth.

408
00:37:27,971 --> 00:37:29,639
There is no cure...

409
00:37:30,515 --> 00:37:31,975
so no one really talks about it.

410
00:37:36,813 --> 00:37:37,814
What happened?

411
00:37:37,981 --> 00:37:39,024
Thena.

412
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,734
You attacked everyone.

413
00:37:41,151 --> 00:37:43,528
Wounded Sersi, Phastos,

414
00:37:43,695 --> 00:37:45,655
you nearly killed Makkari.

415
00:37:48,158 --> 00:37:49,993
I don't remember.

416
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,245
You have Mahd Wy'ry.

417
00:37:52,412 --> 00:37:54,623
Your mind is fracturing

418
00:37:54,706 --> 00:37:56,583
under the weight of your memories.

419
00:37:56,750 --> 00:38:01,004
And all I can do is erase them
so that you can start over.

420
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:05,383
I will have to inform Arishem
and take you back to the ship

421
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:07,260
where we have the technology

422
00:38:07,344 --> 00:38:08,428
to help you.

423
00:38:08,553 --> 00:38:10,805
But she won't be Thena anymore.

424
00:38:10,972 --> 00:38:12,933
What if it happens again?
She could've killed you.

425
00:38:13,099 --> 00:38:14,601
She could have killed all of us.

426
00:38:14,768 --> 00:38:15,769
Please.

427
00:38:17,437 --> 00:38:19,940
Please, I... I want to remember.

428
00:38:20,941 --> 00:38:22,817
I want to remember my life.

429
00:38:23,443 --> 00:38:24,945
Thena, I love you.

430
00:38:25,111 --> 00:38:26,738
But listen to me.

431
00:38:26,905 --> 00:38:30,492
It's not important
if you remember or not.

432
00:38:31,034 --> 00:38:32,786
Your spirit will remain.

433
00:38:32,953 --> 00:38:35,747
You will always be Thena deep inside.

434
00:38:36,206 --> 00:38:37,207
Trust me.

435
00:38:37,374 --> 00:38:38,625
Why should she trust you?

436
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:43,046
You're asking her
to let you erase who she is.

437
00:38:43,213 --> 00:38:45,048
Druig, I know you're upset, but...

438
00:38:45,215 --> 00:38:46,258
Upset?

439
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:50,136
We've trusted you for 7,000 years,

440
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:51,500
and look where you've gotten us.

441
00:38:52,973 --> 00:38:55,809
I've watched humans
destroy each other

442
00:38:55,892 --> 00:38:57,978
when I could stop it all in a heartbeat.

443
00:38:59,771 --> 00:39:02,482
Do you know what that does
to someone after centuries?

444
00:39:03,775 --> 00:39:05,860
Could our mission have been a mistake?

445
00:39:06,653 --> 00:39:08,071
Are we really helping these people

446
00:39:08,154 --> 00:39:09,864
build a better world, huh?

447
00:39:18,915 --> 00:39:21,293
We're just like the soldiers down there.

448
00:39:22,127 --> 00:39:24,296
Pawns to their leaders.

449
00:39:24,963 --> 00:39:27,048
Blinded by loyalty.

450
00:39:30,093 --> 00:39:31,803
It ends now.

451
00:39:49,529 --> 00:39:50,530
Let them go.

452
00:39:50,614 --> 00:39:52,240
You're gonna have to make me.

453
00:39:52,324 --> 00:39:53,325
Stop.

454
00:39:59,873 --> 00:40:01,416
If you wanna stop me,

455
00:40:02,709 --> 00:40:04,586
you're gonna have to kill me.

456
00:40:28,276 --> 00:40:30,111
I'll watch over Thena.

457
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:31,905
Let her keep her memories.

458
00:40:33,156 --> 00:40:35,200
One day, when she attacks you,

459
00:40:35,825 --> 00:40:37,869
you might have to kill her.

460
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,752
We'll take that chance.

461
00:40:55,553 --> 00:40:56,721
You may all go.

462
00:40:59,182 --> 00:41:00,892
The Deviants are gone.

463
00:41:01,768 --> 00:41:04,729
There is no reason
for you to stay with me.

464
00:41:04,896 --> 00:41:06,481
Shouldn't you ask Arishem first?

465
00:41:06,648 --> 00:41:08,441
We're a team,
we should stay together.

466
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:11,528
I didn't ask you for your advice, Ikaris.

467
00:41:11,695 --> 00:41:14,030
Do not forget your place.

468
00:41:17,242 --> 00:41:19,494
This is where we say goodbye.

469
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:22,205
You are free to go.

470
00:41:23,582 --> 00:41:25,750
I want you to go out there.

471
00:41:25,917 --> 00:41:28,670
And live a life for yourselves.

472
00:41:28,837 --> 00:41:30,589
Not as soldiers.

473
00:41:31,298 --> 00:41:34,259
Not with the purpose you were given.

474
00:41:34,634 --> 00:41:37,429
Find your own purpose.

475
00:41:38,305 --> 00:41:42,475
And one day,
when we see each other again,

476
00:41:44,936 --> 00:41:47,939
I want you to tell me what you found.

Welcome.

488
00:42:57,926 --> 00:43:00,720
I am Karun Patel.

489
00:43:00,845 --> 00:43:02,097
Kingo's valet.

490
00:43:02,931 --> 00:43:04,975
It's truly an honor
to be in the presence

491
00:43:05,058 --> 00:43:06,309
of the great Eternals.

00:43:24,411 --> 00:43:26,329
Cut! Okay, everyone,

495
00:43:26,413 --> 00:43:27,539
that was good.

496
00:43:27,706 --> 00:43:29,457
But we could do 10% better.

497
00:43:29,624 --> 00:43:31,710
That was beautiful. Very, very good.

498
00:43:31,876 --> 00:43:33,628
Really, so good.

499
00:43:33,962 --> 00:43:36,047
My friends
from college are here.

500
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:37,591
Hello, boss!

501
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:39,593
Perfect timing!

502
00:43:39,676 --> 00:43:40,927
Welcome to the set of...

503
00:43:41,052 --> 00:43:43,305
Legend of Ikaris.

504
00:43:44,014 --> 00:43:45,098
I'm playing you!

505
00:43:45,265 --> 00:43:46,933
- You like the costume?
- We need to talk.

506
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:48,578
Tell the director
I have some notes for him...

507
00:43:48,602 --> 00:43:49,962
We need to talk to you in private.

508
00:43:50,395 --> 00:43:52,522
Oh, Karun, he's worked
with me for 50 years.

509
00:43:52,606 --> 00:43:53,815
I trust him completely.

510
00:43:53,982 --> 00:43:56,401
Actually, when we first met,
he thought I was a vampire,

511
00:43:56,568 --> 00:43:58,248
and he tried to stake me
through the heart.

512
00:43:58,403 --> 00:44:00,113
I have apologized so many times.

513
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:01,489
Not quite enough times.

514
00:44:01,573 --> 00:44:03,009
Very close, though. I'll let you know.

515
00:44:03,033 --> 00:44:04,510
Oh, I have to get ready
for the next scene.

516
00:44:04,534 --> 00:44:06,036
Come to my tent, we'll talk there.

517
00:44:06,202 --> 00:44:07,513
You guys are gonna love
the next scene.

518
00:44:07,537 --> 00:44:10,457
I come in on a wire
'cause, you know, I can't fly.

519
00:44:10,624 --> 00:44:12,292
Wait, are we getting back together?

520
00:44:12,459 --> 00:44:13,460
We need to talk.

521
00:44:13,543 --> 00:44:14,753
I've been waiting for the day

522
00:44:14,836 --> 00:44:15,980
the world learns the true identity

523
00:44:16,004 --> 00:44:17,005
of the Shadow Warrior.

524
00:44:17,172 --> 00:44:18,632
Ajak's dead.

525
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,096
She was killed.

526
00:44:26,014 --> 00:44:27,390
It was a Deviant.

527
00:44:31,937 --> 00:44:33,563
The Deviants are back.

528
00:44:33,730 --> 00:44:35,190
We don't know how many there are.

529
00:44:39,235 --> 00:44:40,654
You need to come with us.

530
00:44:56,878 --> 00:44:59,038
I can't just go. I mean,
all these people depend on me.

531
00:44:59,172 --> 00:45:00,608
We just started shooting this movie.

532
00:45:00,632 --> 00:45:01,752
It's the first of a trilogy.

533
00:45:02,342 --> 00:45:04,344
We just got BTS to do a cameo...

534
00:45:05,929 --> 00:45:07,097
Sir,

535
00:45:07,514 --> 00:45:09,514
- may I say something?
- Please don't say anything.

536
00:45:09,641 --> 00:45:10,684
I think you should go.

537
00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:12,090
I just said don't say anything.

538
00:45:12,227 --> 00:45:16,481
"Life affords no greater duty
than to protect one's family!"

539
00:45:17,315 --> 00:45:19,276
Remember? It's your favorite line

540
00:45:19,442 --> 00:45:23,947
from <i>The Shadow Warrior 2:
Voyage of Time.</i>

541
00:45:24,698 --> 00:45:26,533
Your family needs you.

542
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:39,629
Seven thousand years.

543
00:45:41,423 --> 00:45:43,341
That's how long
the battle between Eternals

544
00:45:43,425 --> 00:45:45,135
<i>and Deviants has raged for.</i>

545
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,762
You think I'm a movie star.

546
00:45:47,929 --> 00:45:50,765
<i>Well, I am. But I am also...</i>

547
00:45:51,683 --> 00:45:53,268
<i>an Eternal.</i>

548
00:45:53,435 --> 00:45:54,936
<i>Kingo, what are you doing?</i>

549
00:45:55,812 --> 00:45:59,024
I think we should be
remembered, so...

550
00:45:59,316 --> 00:46:03,361
I am making a documentary about us.

551
00:46:03,486 --> 00:46:06,489
You are about to meet
my fellow Eternal, Sprite.

552
00:46:06,656 --> 00:46:08,867
Sprite, tell them about yourself.

553
00:46:09,034 --> 00:46:10,368
Oh, wait.

554
00:46:14,247 --> 00:46:16,750
<i>Okay, well, we'll circle back to her.</i>

555
00:46:17,417 --> 00:46:19,628
This is Sersi.

556
00:46:20,211 --> 00:46:21,212
Sersi,

557
00:46:21,379 --> 00:46:23,214
tell them about yourself.

558
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:26,384
<i>- Uh...
- We're rolling.</i>

559
00:46:26,468 --> 00:46:27,469
<i>Well, uh...</i>

560
00:46:29,137 --> 00:46:33,725
I can change a rock into water.

561
00:46:34,142 --> 00:46:37,020
Uh, I could turn a rock into wood.

562
00:46:37,187 --> 00:46:39,272
Or a rock into metal.

563
00:46:39,439 --> 00:46:41,524
Actually, one time,
I turned a rock into air.

564
00:46:41,650 --> 00:46:42,651
Cut.

565
00:46:42,734 --> 00:46:45,153
Um, you know what?
Why don't you think about it,

566
00:46:45,236 --> 00:46:46,863
and we'll get back to you, okay?

567
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:48,281
Let's go.

568
00:46:50,992 --> 00:46:53,328
Sprite says
you're addicted to this thing.

569
00:46:55,455 --> 00:46:56,623
Oh, this?

570
00:46:57,499 --> 00:46:59,000
Look at this.

571
00:47:01,127 --> 00:47:02,254
Whoa.

572
00:47:02,337 --> 00:47:03,964
You know,
seeing as we don't age.

573
00:47:04,464 --> 00:47:06,299
I think you look quite good.

574
00:47:07,092 --> 00:47:08,885
Don't you?

575
00:47:13,056 --> 00:47:14,933
Nobody ever wonders
how you managed

576
00:47:15,016 --> 00:47:16,935
to be the leading man for over 100 years?

577
00:47:17,102 --> 00:47:18,782
Oh, I don't know
what you're talking about.

578
00:47:18,812 --> 00:47:20,981
That is my great-great-grandfather,

579
00:47:21,147 --> 00:47:23,441
that is my great-grandfather,

580
00:47:23,608 --> 00:47:24,609
grandfather,

581
00:47:24,776 --> 00:47:26,820
father, and me.

582
00:47:26,987 --> 00:47:28,697
I'm part of the greatest dynasty

583
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:29,990
in the history of Bollywood.

584
00:47:30,448 --> 00:47:31,449
Pretty impressive, right?

585
00:47:31,616 --> 00:47:33,660
You abandoned me in Macedonia.

586
00:47:35,412 --> 00:47:38,873
Okay, I got sick
of moving every five years.

587
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:42,002
People freak out
when they notice that you don't...

588
00:47:44,087 --> 00:47:45,088
age.

589
00:47:46,339 --> 00:47:47,799
I thought we were friends.

590
00:47:54,806 --> 00:47:56,683
Do you know why I love movies?

591
00:47:57,559 --> 00:47:59,144
Because of you.

592
00:47:59,311 --> 00:48:00,937
I missed sitting in the audience,

593
00:48:01,021 --> 00:48:02,105
listening to your stories,

594
00:48:02,272 --> 00:48:03,523
watching your illusions.

595
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,530
We should've all stayed together.

596
00:48:12,532 --> 00:48:14,618
Ajak would still be alive.

597
00:48:16,202 --> 00:48:17,996
She should have never let us go.

598
00:48:28,798 --> 00:48:30,592
This is the Deviant you fought in London?

599
00:48:31,009 --> 00:48:32,427
It's different.

600
00:48:33,219 --> 00:48:35,263
There must be more out there
than we thought.

601
00:48:35,639 --> 00:48:36,723
Oh.

602
00:48:36,806 --> 00:48:38,808
Is... Is this a Deviant, sir?

603
00:48:38,975 --> 00:48:40,810
Yep.

604
00:48:40,936 --> 00:48:42,646
It's a beautiful creature.

605
00:48:42,812 --> 00:48:46,274
What? This? This? No. It's hideous.

606
00:48:46,441 --> 00:48:49,069
You've never had one try
to bite your head off. Roll.

607
00:48:49,152 --> 00:48:50,278
Oh.

608
00:48:50,654 --> 00:48:52,697
You're about to meet
two of the greatest warriors

609
00:48:52,781 --> 00:48:53,949
the world has ever known.

610
00:48:54,407 --> 00:48:57,827
<i>Thena, legendary, deadly, fashionable.</i>

611
00:48:58,161 --> 00:48:59,704
And her trusty friend...

612
00:48:59,871 --> 00:49:00,956
Door.

613
00:49:01,665 --> 00:49:03,708
a mighty powerhouse of strength,

614
00:49:03,792 --> 00:49:06,753
<i>the fearsome Gilgamesh!</i>

615
00:49:09,256 --> 00:49:10,298
Gilgamesh!

616
00:49:13,301 --> 00:49:14,886
<i>What took you so long?</i>

617
00:49:17,973 --> 00:49:19,891
You look younger today, Sprite.

618
00:49:19,975 --> 00:49:21,476
I have the same apron.

619
00:49:21,977 --> 00:49:23,270
Who the hell are you?

620
00:49:23,687 --> 00:49:25,772
I'm Karun. Kingo's valet.

621
00:49:26,398 --> 00:49:29,025
Oh, valet. Like Alfred in <i>Batman.</i>

622
00:49:29,484 --> 00:49:31,861
Gilgamesh. The Deviants are back.

623
00:49:32,028 --> 00:49:34,614
No shit.
I could have used some help.

624
00:49:34,781 --> 00:49:37,242
We were attacked
by a Deviant in London, too.

625
00:49:37,534 --> 00:49:39,286
Even Ikaris couldn't kill it.

626
00:49:40,161 --> 00:49:41,162
You couldn't?

627
00:49:41,329 --> 00:49:43,331
I was distracted.

628
00:49:43,498 --> 00:49:45,584
Sure, man.

629
00:49:45,709 --> 00:49:48,295
Hey, you guys wanna try my pie?

630
00:49:50,589 --> 00:49:52,173
I'm sorry, Gil.

631
00:49:52,841 --> 00:49:54,217
Ajak's dead.

632
00:49:57,053 --> 00:49:58,346
It's true, buddy.

633
00:49:58,888 --> 00:50:00,181
We lost her.

634
00:50:32,172 --> 00:50:33,340
Sersi.

635
00:50:34,758 --> 00:50:36,635
The attack triggered her.

636
00:50:36,801 --> 00:50:38,720
She's no fun to be around right now.

637
00:50:40,305 --> 00:50:41,765
Hey, Thena.

638
00:50:42,182 --> 00:50:44,059
Look who's here.

639
00:50:44,935 --> 00:50:46,102
Give me your hand.

640
00:50:48,855 --> 00:50:50,231
Thena.

641
00:50:50,315 --> 00:50:53,068
Everyone in Centuri-6
is going to die.

642
00:50:53,777 --> 00:50:54,819
Give me your hand.

643
00:50:54,986 --> 00:50:57,197
It's too late. We can't save them.

644
00:50:57,447 --> 00:50:59,241
Thena.

645
00:51:05,372 --> 00:51:06,623
Thena.

646
00:51:07,332 --> 00:51:10,043
We came to Earth
together on our ship.

647
00:51:12,337 --> 00:51:14,047
You're an Eternal.

648
00:51:14,881 --> 00:51:17,634
The greatest warrior of Olympia.

649
00:51:17,801 --> 00:51:19,886
The legendary protector of Athens.

650
00:51:21,388 --> 00:51:23,265
The goddess of war.

651
00:51:25,267 --> 00:51:27,602
Remember who you are.

652
00:51:35,652 --> 00:51:37,112
Remember.

653
00:51:53,003 --> 00:51:54,963
- Thena.
- Hi.

654
00:51:55,922 --> 00:51:56,923
Hello.

655
00:51:57,299 --> 00:51:59,259
Hey, who's your gardener?

656
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:02,971
This is just what you guys
eat every day?

657
00:52:03,138 --> 00:52:04,681
- Yeah, this is amazing.
- Every day.

658
00:52:04,848 --> 00:52:06,933
- Thank you for this.
- Oh, you're welcome.

659
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:08,268
Help yourself.

660
00:52:08,435 --> 00:52:11,605
This one is a trio of wine,
beer, and mead.

661
00:52:11,771 --> 00:52:14,232
Made for all the soldiers
in the battle of Troy.

662
00:52:14,899 --> 00:52:16,484
That's so thoughtful.

663
00:52:23,283 --> 00:52:24,868
Should she be drinking?

664
00:52:26,119 --> 00:52:29,539
No, hers is
non-alcoholic. For kids.

665
00:52:31,625 --> 00:52:33,793
I gave you the same thing, Sprite.

666
00:52:36,421 --> 00:52:37,422
For kids.

667
00:52:39,674 --> 00:52:41,134
I was just kidding.

668
00:52:41,217 --> 00:52:44,596
Yours is a secret brew
Odin taught me as a thank-you

669
00:52:44,763 --> 00:52:46,723
after we helped defeat
Laufey's army in Tonsberg.

670
00:52:48,016 --> 00:52:50,310
What? Oh.

671
00:52:50,435 --> 00:52:51,436
I'm a big baby.

672
00:52:51,603 --> 00:52:53,480
Very mature. Can you stop?

673
00:52:54,356 --> 00:52:55,690
- Stop.
- Speaking of Odin...

674
00:52:55,857 --> 00:52:58,443
Thor used to follow me around
when he was a little kid.

675
00:52:58,610 --> 00:53:01,238
Now he's a famous Avenger
and won't return my calls.

676
00:53:01,404 --> 00:53:03,740
So, now that Captain Rogers
and Iron Man are both gone,

677
00:53:03,907 --> 00:53:05,867
who do you think
is gonna lead the Avengers?

678
00:53:06,534 --> 00:53:08,036
I could lead them.

679
00:53:08,203 --> 00:53:10,413
- I figure I'd be good at that.
- Yeah, you would.

680
00:53:10,747 --> 00:53:12,791
Ajak didn't even choose you
to lead us.

681
00:53:13,083 --> 00:53:15,377
- Whoa.
- Ouch, Gil. Ouch.

682
00:53:15,543 --> 00:53:16,812
- Harsh.
- I'm gonna let that one slide

683
00:53:16,836 --> 00:53:17,837
because, you know,

684
00:53:17,921 --> 00:53:19,398
you've always been bitter
that I can fly and you can't.

685
00:53:19,422 --> 00:53:20,632
Oh, so what, you can fly.

686
00:53:20,799 --> 00:53:22,509
I'm better-looking,
everybody knows that.

687
00:53:22,676 --> 00:53:23,677
Where you going?

688
00:53:25,679 --> 00:53:27,347
I'm just gonna get some air.

689
00:53:31,893 --> 00:53:34,562
Mmm. This is really good, Gil.

690
00:53:34,729 --> 00:53:36,064
You know, I could sell this.

691
00:53:36,147 --> 00:53:37,941
Put my face on it,
move some units.

692
00:53:38,275 --> 00:53:39,567
I made it from corn.

693
00:53:39,651 --> 00:53:43,363
I chew each kernel myself
and ferment it in my spit.

694
00:53:57,544 --> 00:54:00,380
Is this the Centuri-6
Thena was talking about?

695
00:54:00,714 --> 00:54:02,507
Yeah, it's a planet.

696
00:54:03,425 --> 00:54:05,051
She thinks she used to live there

697
00:54:05,135 --> 00:54:07,053
until it was destroyed.

698
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:10,849
Always talks about massive
quakes ripping it apart.

699
00:54:11,016 --> 00:54:12,934
Everyone died, including herself.

700
00:54:13,351 --> 00:54:16,021
We had an unprecedented global
earthquake three days ago.

701
00:54:16,688 --> 00:54:18,523
Oh, that's what that was.

702
00:54:18,690 --> 00:54:20,442
I thought I was drunk.

703
00:54:21,192 --> 00:54:23,403
Ajak chose me to lead us, but...

704
00:54:24,154 --> 00:54:26,698
I can't even figure out
how to speak to Arishem.

705
00:54:26,865 --> 00:54:28,742
I've tried so many times.

706
00:54:29,951 --> 00:54:32,037
Maybe you're trying too hard.

707
00:54:32,996 --> 00:54:35,582
Sometimes, you just have to listen.

708
00:55:23,004 --> 00:55:24,130
Sersi.

709
00:55:25,006 --> 00:55:26,091
Arishem.

710
00:55:26,675 --> 00:55:28,551
Ajak was killed by a Deviant.

711
00:55:28,718 --> 00:55:31,137
We think it absorbed her power.

712
00:55:31,304 --> 00:55:34,015
And something unusual
is happening to Earth.

713
00:55:34,182 --> 00:55:37,185
It is a side effect
of the emergence.

714
00:55:38,603 --> 00:55:40,230
The emergence?

715
00:55:40,981 --> 00:55:42,482
It is time for you to learn

716
00:55:42,565 --> 00:55:45,151
the true purpose of your mission.

717
00:55:45,318 --> 00:55:46,861
You were sent to Earth

718
00:55:46,945 --> 00:55:50,657
to bring forth the Celestial Tiamut.

719
00:55:51,866 --> 00:55:56,538
Every billion years,
new Celestials must be born.

720
00:55:57,122 --> 00:56:00,083
I plant Celestial seeds into host planets

721
00:56:00,166 --> 00:56:01,626
across the universe.

722
00:56:03,753 --> 00:56:07,632
The planet Earth was chosen
to host the Celestial Tiamut.

723
00:56:13,013 --> 00:56:14,598
<i>In order to grow,</i>

724
00:56:14,764 --> 00:56:17,350
<i>Tiamut needs vast amounts of energy</i>

725
00:56:17,434 --> 00:56:18,602
<i>from intelligent life.</i>

726
00:56:19,603 --> 00:56:23,106
<i>The Deviants prevented this
by consuming humans</i>

727
00:56:23,273 --> 00:56:25,942
<i>until the Eternals eliminated them.</i>

728
00:56:26,568 --> 00:56:29,946
<i>Now, the human population of this planet</i>

729
00:56:30,030 --> 00:56:32,490
<i>has reached the required amount.</i>

730
00:56:32,657 --> 00:56:35,702
<i>It is time for the emergence to begin.</i>

731
00:56:54,763 --> 00:56:56,723
But...

732
00:56:58,016 --> 00:56:59,768
everyone on Earth will die.

733
00:57:01,436 --> 00:57:04,522
The end of one life, Sersi,

734
00:57:05,899 --> 00:57:08,693
<i>is the beginning of another.</i>

735
00:57:21,665 --> 00:57:25,543
<i>Our universe is a constant
exchange of energy.</i>

736
00:57:26,544 --> 00:57:30,590
<i>An infinite cycle of creation
and destruction.</i>

737
00:57:31,508 --> 00:57:33,760
<i>Celestials use energy</i>

738
00:57:33,927 --> 00:57:37,013
<i>gathered from host planets to create suns,</i>

739
00:57:37,681 --> 00:57:40,892
<i>generating gravity, heat, and light</i>

740
00:57:41,059 --> 00:57:43,561
<i>for new galaxies to form.</i>

741
00:57:48,566 --> 00:57:50,193
<i>Without us,</i>

742
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:53,530
<i>our universe will fall into darkness.</i>

743
00:57:56,283 --> 00:57:58,159
All life will die.

744
00:57:59,369 --> 00:58:01,121
Ajak knew the truth?

745
00:58:01,538 --> 00:58:03,582
She has helped many Celestials

746
00:58:03,665 --> 00:58:06,418
to emerge over millions of years.

747
00:58:06,585 --> 00:58:07,711
So have you.

748
00:58:10,714 --> 00:58:12,924
Earth was my first mission.

749
00:58:14,426 --> 00:58:18,138
I was home, on Olympia.

750
00:58:19,472 --> 00:58:21,891
There is no Olympia.

751
00:58:39,993 --> 00:58:43,038
This is your true home, Sersi.

752
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:45,790
The World Forge.

753
00:58:48,627 --> 00:58:52,881
It is here that I built
and programmed the Eternals.

754
00:59:28,833 --> 00:59:30,835
Everything dies except us

755
00:59:32,128 --> 00:59:34,172
because we were never alive.

756
00:59:38,385 --> 00:59:40,178
Why don't I remember any of this?

757
00:59:50,563 --> 00:59:53,775
Because your memories
are erased and reset

758
00:59:53,858 --> 00:59:55,193
after each emergence.

759
00:59:56,319 --> 00:59:57,862
They are stored here.

760
01:00:00,574 --> 01:00:02,200
Why do you keep them?

761
01:00:02,867 --> 01:00:06,288
I keep them in order
to study the Deviants.

762
01:00:07,414 --> 01:00:10,000
I created the Deviants, Sersi,

763
01:00:10,166 --> 01:00:13,086
for the same purpose I created you.

764
01:00:14,170 --> 01:00:18,008
<i>Every Celestial host planet
has its own predators.</i>

765
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:24,848
<i>I first sent the Deviants
to exterminate them</i>

766
01:00:25,015 --> 01:00:27,559
<i>so intelligent life could grow.</i>

767
01:00:33,106 --> 01:00:35,775
<i>But there was a flaw in their design.</i>

768
01:00:36,985 --> 01:00:38,320
<i>They evolved.</i>

769
01:00:38,486 --> 01:00:40,530
<i>Became predators themselves.</i>

770
01:00:42,490 --> 01:00:44,701
And I lost control of them.

771
01:00:46,786 --> 01:00:49,789
I built and programmed you,
Eternals,

772
01:00:49,956 --> 01:00:53,793
to be synthetic beings
and incapable of evolution,

773
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:56,129
to correct my mistake.

774
01:00:58,423 --> 01:01:02,552
Sersi, Ajak has chosen you
to take her place

775
01:01:02,719 --> 01:01:04,971
as the Prime Eternal.

776
01:01:05,555 --> 01:01:07,307
Do not fail me.

777
01:01:25,909 --> 01:01:28,536
So, you're saying
we're basically fancy robots?

778
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:31,998
And our past memories
are stored somewhere

779
01:01:32,791 --> 01:01:34,376
in space?

780
01:01:34,584 --> 01:01:36,920
And Arishem made the Deviants.

781
01:01:38,755 --> 01:01:40,507
I'm sorry, Thena.

782
01:01:40,799 --> 01:01:42,217
You tried to warn us.

783
01:01:42,384 --> 01:01:44,344
The last time
Arishem reset your memories,

784
01:01:44,427 --> 01:01:46,388
something must have gone wrong.

785
01:01:47,138 --> 01:01:48,139
What do you mean?

786
01:01:48,306 --> 01:01:51,643
Well, that's what
Mahd Wy'ry is, isn't it?

787
01:01:51,810 --> 01:01:53,520
All this time,
Thena was remembering

788
01:01:53,603 --> 01:01:55,313
all the other planets we were sent to

789
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:57,565
and everyone dying
during the emergence.

790
01:01:58,024 --> 01:01:59,484
I thought we were heroes.

791
01:02:00,151 --> 01:02:01,486
Turns out we're the bad guys.

792
01:02:01,653 --> 01:02:03,947
We're not the bad guys, okay?

793
01:02:04,114 --> 01:02:05,448
We've helped the Celestials

794
01:02:05,532 --> 01:02:06,992
expand life across the universe.

795
01:02:07,158 --> 01:02:10,328
That's not what bad guys do.
That's what good guys do.

796
01:02:10,495 --> 01:02:11,705
Every time innocent lives

797
01:02:11,788 --> 01:02:13,468
have been sacrificed for the greater good,

798
01:02:13,582 --> 01:02:15,625
it turns out to be a mistake.

799
01:02:16,251 --> 01:02:17,919
We have to stop the emergence.

800
01:02:18,086 --> 01:02:21,715
Sersi, we have no right to
stop the birth of a Celestial.

801
01:02:21,881 --> 01:02:23,675
There has to be a way
Tiamut can emerge

802
01:02:23,758 --> 01:02:24,918
without destroying the Earth.

803
01:02:25,844 --> 01:02:29,055
We just have to delay it
until we figure out how.

804
01:02:29,848 --> 01:02:32,058
Could Druig control its mind?

805
01:02:32,225 --> 01:02:34,477
Maybe put it to sleep?

806
01:02:34,644 --> 01:02:35,770
"Put it to sleep"?

807
01:02:36,229 --> 01:02:37,355
Are you serious?

808
01:02:37,522 --> 01:02:40,025
Gilgamesh asked Druig
to put me to sleep once.

809
01:02:41,359 --> 01:02:43,119
So I could take a vacation
to Fiji, you know?

810
01:02:43,236 --> 01:02:44,863
We're talking about a Celestial, okay?

811
01:02:44,946 --> 01:02:45,947
We have to try.

812
01:02:46,114 --> 01:02:49,451
Come on, we're not gonna let
everyone on Earth die, right?

813
01:02:49,618 --> 01:02:50,952
Right.

814
01:02:52,871 --> 01:02:55,999
I'm human. I'm a little biased.

815
01:02:56,124 --> 01:02:57,709
The world is ending.

816
01:02:57,876 --> 01:02:59,336
You need to go home.

817
01:03:00,295 --> 01:03:01,671
And do what?

818
01:03:02,297 --> 01:03:03,924
Watch TV?

819
01:03:04,090 --> 01:03:07,594
When I could be with the
Earth's original superheroes

820
01:03:07,761 --> 01:03:10,180
as they try to save the world?

821
01:03:11,014 --> 01:03:12,182
Fine.

822
01:03:12,349 --> 01:03:14,893
If you want to, stay.

823
01:03:15,060 --> 01:03:16,811
Thank you very much, sir.

824
01:03:18,521 --> 01:03:19,731
Gilgamesh,

825
01:03:19,898 --> 01:03:21,584
could you please
get rid of the saliva beer?

826
01:03:21,608 --> 01:03:22,901
I thought you like it, man.

827
01:03:23,068 --> 01:03:25,070
We need to go. Now.

828
01:03:25,904 --> 01:03:27,280
Find the others.

829
01:03:27,614 --> 01:03:28,865
Once we're all together,

830
01:03:29,032 --> 01:03:31,743
we'll decide what to do
about the emergence.

831
01:04:02,732 --> 01:04:04,609
Good afternoon.

832
01:04:05,777 --> 01:04:07,362
It's very nice here, sir.

833
01:04:07,529 --> 01:04:08,822
Don't be fooled.

834
01:04:09,948 --> 01:04:12,033
Ignorance is bliss.

835
01:04:13,743 --> 01:04:16,288
Hey. We're looking for Druig.

836
01:04:16,454 --> 01:04:17,455
Is he here?

837
01:04:17,581 --> 01:04:18,582
Yes.

838
01:04:18,665 --> 01:04:19,791
How do you know Druig?

839
01:04:20,584 --> 01:04:21,751
We're friends...

840
01:04:22,752 --> 01:04:24,087
from college.

841
01:04:28,008 --> 01:04:29,217
Hello, Sprite.

842
01:04:37,017 --> 01:04:38,893
I missed all of you.

843
01:04:41,855 --> 01:04:45,775
Please, make yourselves at home.

844
01:04:50,572 --> 01:04:52,365
You've given me a lot of bad news

845
01:04:52,449 --> 01:04:53,575
in one go, my lady.

846
01:04:54,326 --> 01:04:55,493
Will you help us?

847
01:04:55,994 --> 01:04:57,037
I am glad that...

848
01:05:04,336 --> 01:05:05,629
Hey, what's your service?

849
01:05:05,712 --> 01:05:07,172
I'm not getting any bars.

850
01:05:08,882 --> 01:05:12,218
Do you all remember
this forest? Beautiful.

851
01:05:13,386 --> 01:05:15,430
It was the last place
we all lived together.

852
01:05:16,890 --> 01:05:19,851
I've protected these people
for 20 generations now

853
01:05:20,018 --> 01:05:23,021
from the outside world
and from themselves.

854
01:05:23,188 --> 01:05:26,107
Your kind, my friend,
you will be responsible

855
01:05:26,191 --> 01:05:27,901
for your own extinction one day.

856
01:05:28,443 --> 01:05:29,986
Don't you think?

857
01:05:30,445 --> 01:05:32,405
I think we must learn from our mistakes

858
01:05:32,489 --> 01:05:33,615
and do better, sir.

859
01:05:33,782 --> 01:05:35,659
You must not give up hope.

860
01:05:38,578 --> 01:05:40,288
Oh, no, you didn't.

861
01:05:40,372 --> 01:05:42,916
Okay, new rule, no more
possessing people's valets.

862
01:05:42,999 --> 01:05:44,599
Oh, where is your sense of humor, Kingo?

863
01:05:44,626 --> 01:05:45,627
I'm sorry, sir.

864
01:05:45,794 --> 01:05:48,004
Don't apologize, it's not your fault.

865
01:05:48,713 --> 01:05:51,341
You are not a God.
You know that, right?

866
01:05:51,508 --> 01:05:54,636
How ironic. Kingo, the movie star.

867
01:05:55,303 --> 01:05:56,888
I've directed some things, too.

868
01:05:57,055 --> 01:05:58,431
Oh, yeah? Like what?

869
01:05:59,057 --> 01:06:00,642
Some Internet content.

870
01:06:01,393 --> 01:06:02,394
How many views?

871
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:04,479
I don't do it for the views.

872
01:06:04,646 --> 01:06:06,439
Let's go. He's wasting our time.

873
01:06:06,606 --> 01:06:08,900
- We need him.
- Ikaris.

874
01:06:09,943 --> 01:06:11,027
I missed you.

875
01:06:11,945 --> 01:06:14,030
Are you gonna charm me
or threaten me?

876
01:06:14,197 --> 01:06:16,241
I mean, there's a third option,
if you prefer that.

877
01:06:16,408 --> 01:06:18,201
It must be heartbreaking to find out

878
01:06:18,285 --> 01:06:19,428
that you're not Mother's favorite.

879
01:06:19,452 --> 01:06:20,596
And I'm sure she'd be real proud

880
01:06:20,620 --> 01:06:22,431
- of what you've been up to.
- Druig, this is serious.

881
01:06:22,455 --> 01:06:24,249
I'll tell you what's serious.

882
01:06:25,166 --> 01:06:27,586
I've just been told I've been
sent on a suicide mission

883
01:06:27,669 --> 01:06:29,129
for the past 7,000 years,

884
01:06:29,296 --> 01:06:32,632
and that my entire existence is a lie.

885
01:06:35,802 --> 01:06:37,512
So, excuse me for not giving a shit

886
01:06:37,596 --> 01:06:39,139
about your plan right now.

887
01:06:44,019 --> 01:06:45,437
Druig sucks.

888
01:06:45,604 --> 01:06:47,230
He does, sir.

889
01:07:07,708 --> 01:07:09,461
I don't like this place.

890
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:11,129
Druig needs to think,

891
01:07:11,212 --> 01:07:13,089
and Sersi wants us to wait, so...

892
01:07:13,256 --> 01:07:15,216
- we wait.
- Mm.

893
01:07:16,343 --> 01:07:20,180
I couldn't recognize myself
in Sprite's illusions.

894
01:07:21,264 --> 01:07:23,475
Those were the good old days.

895
01:07:25,352 --> 01:07:27,895
What if I can't fight anymore?

896
01:07:29,064 --> 01:07:30,982
- Of course you can.
- Mm.

897
01:07:31,649 --> 01:07:33,693
What if I hurt you again?

898
01:07:34,069 --> 01:07:39,282
Come on. You know who you are.
You're Thena, goddess of war.

899
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:45,538
Thank you.

900
01:07:46,998 --> 01:07:48,250
For what?

901
01:07:50,126 --> 01:07:53,296
- For always taking care of me.
- Oh.

902
01:07:54,672 --> 01:07:56,382
I'd do it again.

903
01:07:59,219 --> 01:08:01,179
On any planet.

904
01:08:20,323 --> 01:08:21,783
I like watching him, too.

905
01:08:21,949 --> 01:08:23,118
Jeez.

906
01:08:24,243 --> 01:08:25,870
I don't think it's creepy at all.

907
01:08:28,665 --> 01:08:30,500
Have you read <i>Peter Pan?</i>

908
01:08:30,667 --> 01:08:33,795
Okay, so, to me, Ikaris is Peter,

909
01:08:33,962 --> 01:08:35,171
Sersi is Wendy,

910
01:08:35,255 --> 01:08:38,300
you are Tinker Bell, for obvious reasons,

911
01:08:39,509 --> 01:08:41,886
and the rest of us are the Lost Boys.

912
01:08:42,345 --> 01:08:43,846
What's your point?

913
01:08:44,306 --> 01:08:46,850
Tinker Bell's always been
in love with Peter.

914
01:08:50,270 --> 01:08:51,771
And it's hard for her

915
01:08:51,855 --> 01:08:53,481
'cause she can never be with him.

916
01:08:56,401 --> 01:08:57,902
I'm sorry, Sprite.

917
01:08:59,821 --> 01:09:01,072
Kingo...

918
01:09:03,658 --> 01:09:06,161
why did Arishem
make me this way?

919
01:09:08,246 --> 01:09:09,706
I don't know.

920
01:09:17,255 --> 01:09:18,632
I thought you broke it.

921
01:09:18,798 --> 01:09:20,592
Always bring backups.

922
01:09:25,722 --> 01:09:27,515
You have a very angry family, sir.

923
01:09:28,266 --> 01:09:30,143
Yeah, it's a big issue.

924
01:09:30,310 --> 01:09:32,020
<i>What about King Midas?</i>

925
01:09:32,103 --> 01:09:33,372
<i>Everything he touched turned to gold.</i>

926
01:09:33,396 --> 01:09:34,397
<i>- Was that you?
</i>- Dane.

927
01:09:34,564 --> 01:09:36,483
<i>- Confucius? Aristotle?
</i>- Call your uncle.

928
01:09:36,650 --> 01:09:38,234
<i>What? My uncle? No.</i>

929
01:09:38,401 --> 01:09:40,570
You've always wanted to make
amends with him, right?

930
01:09:40,737 --> 01:09:43,114
Now is the time. Trust me.

931
01:09:43,281 --> 01:09:44,866
<i>Sersi, you're so weird.</i>

932
01:09:45,033 --> 01:09:47,452
Dane? Dane?

933
01:09:47,953 --> 01:09:50,247
You're breaking up.

934
01:09:50,413 --> 01:09:51,456
You're breaking up?

935
01:09:54,167 --> 01:09:55,794
How did he take the news?

936
01:09:56,211 --> 01:09:57,531
Couldn't bring myself to tell him

937
01:09:57,587 --> 01:09:58,755
it was the end of the world.

938
01:09:58,922 --> 01:10:01,174
There's nothing he could do.

939
01:10:01,341 --> 01:10:02,342
Sersi.

940
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:07,430
I'm worried about you.

941
01:10:08,431 --> 01:10:09,516
If Arishem finds out

942
01:10:09,599 --> 01:10:11,393
you're trying to stop the emergence...

943
01:10:13,353 --> 01:10:16,273
I'm not powerful enough
to protect you from him.

944
01:10:21,820 --> 01:10:23,321
I'm not afraid.

945
01:10:24,573 --> 01:10:26,992
This violent cycle has to end.

946
01:10:31,496 --> 01:10:33,331
Hey, stop worrying about me.

947
01:10:34,416 --> 01:10:35,750
Old habit.

948
01:10:42,924 --> 01:10:45,010
Why did you leave?

949
01:10:46,803 --> 01:10:47,929
I told myself

950
01:10:48,805 --> 01:10:50,807
something must have happened to you.

951
01:10:50,974 --> 01:10:52,976
So, I waited.

952
01:10:53,143 --> 01:10:55,604
Days became years,

953
01:10:55,770 --> 01:10:57,981
and you never came back.

954
01:10:59,858 --> 01:11:01,443
Sersi,

955
01:11:02,193 --> 01:11:04,029
oh, I've missed you.

956
01:11:06,698 --> 01:11:08,700
I didn't want to leave.

957
01:11:11,786 --> 01:11:13,055
There's something
I have to tell...

958
01:11:13,079 --> 01:11:14,831
Ikaris!

959
01:11:15,457 --> 01:11:16,666
Ikaris!

960
01:11:21,838 --> 01:11:22,881
Miss?

961
01:11:23,965 --> 01:11:25,258
You're ok?

962
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:27,302
Watch out!

963
01:11:27,469 --> 01:11:29,721
Clear the camp!

964
01:11:32,098 --> 01:11:33,433
Get behind me!

965
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:34,601
One of them took Ikaris.

966
01:11:34,768 --> 01:11:35,936
It's an ambush!

967
01:11:45,362 --> 01:11:46,905
Very nice, sir!

968
01:11:47,239 --> 01:11:48,782
<i>Are you mental? Hide!</i>

969
01:11:48,949 --> 01:11:51,326
We need action sequences.

970
01:11:51,952 --> 01:11:53,161
Sir!

971
01:11:53,745 --> 01:11:55,538
Sprite, get Karun out of here.

972
01:11:57,791 --> 01:12:00,669
How many cameras
did you bring, young man?

973
01:12:08,468 --> 01:12:09,886
Kingo!

974
01:12:10,053 --> 01:12:11,471
Come on!

975
01:12:18,186 --> 01:12:19,396
This way!

976
01:12:19,562 --> 01:12:20,730
Quickly! Come on!

977
01:12:25,860 --> 01:12:27,612
Get in! Get in!

978
01:13:04,774 --> 01:13:06,359
Ikaris!

979
01:13:21,958 --> 01:13:25,754
I've fought that one before.
It's stronger than the others.

980
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:30,050
No.

981
01:13:31,718 --> 01:13:33,428
Terrible timing, Thena.

982
01:13:33,511 --> 01:13:35,263
Thena!

983
01:13:43,772 --> 01:13:45,023
Stop, Thena!

984
01:14:19,224 --> 01:14:20,517
Druig!

985
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:21,643
Let them go.

986
01:14:21,726 --> 01:14:23,270
Now is not the time, Sersi.

987
01:14:23,436 --> 01:14:26,606
Please. I know
you're better than this.

988
01:14:35,865 --> 01:14:38,034
Druig.
What's happening?

989
01:14:38,201 --> 01:14:40,203
Go! Get to the river!

990
01:14:57,721 --> 01:14:59,139
Gilgamesh.

991
01:14:59,806 --> 01:15:01,516
A little help here?

992
01:15:01,683 --> 01:15:02,809
Stay here.

993
01:15:03,476 --> 01:15:04,477
Say it.

994
01:15:05,895 --> 01:15:06,896
Stay here.

995
01:15:07,063 --> 01:15:09,149
Good. You're okay.

996
01:15:21,036 --> 01:15:22,370
They're headed for the camp.

997
01:15:22,537 --> 01:15:24,247
Go. They need you.

998
01:15:24,414 --> 01:15:25,832
Go, Ikaris.

999
01:15:33,798 --> 01:15:35,926
Sprite, buy me some time!

1000
01:15:42,390 --> 01:15:44,017
Whoa. Whoa!

1001
01:15:45,226 --> 01:15:47,020
Can you hurry up?

1002
01:15:49,147 --> 01:15:50,148
Now!

1003
01:15:54,110 --> 01:15:55,904
Dishoom.

1004
01:16:04,663 --> 01:16:07,457
Karun! Did you get that?

1005
01:16:07,624 --> 01:16:09,376
I did, sir!

1006
01:16:44,411 --> 01:16:46,162
- Kingo!
- Just go.

1007
01:16:46,329 --> 01:16:47,789
I'm not leaving you.

1008
01:16:48,123 --> 01:16:49,165
Sprite!

1009
01:17:23,825 --> 01:17:24,826
Ikaris!

1010
01:18:07,452 --> 01:18:09,871
Sersi! Are you all right?

1011
01:18:20,882 --> 01:18:22,592
How did you do that?

1012
01:18:23,426 --> 01:18:24,928
I don't know.

1013
01:18:38,358 --> 01:18:40,110
Stop, stop, stop.

1014
01:18:41,903 --> 01:18:42,988
Thena.

1015
01:19:25,822 --> 01:19:28,116
No. Gilgamesh.

1016
01:19:28,617 --> 01:19:29,910
Stay back.

1017
01:19:38,168 --> 01:19:39,586
Ajak...

1018
01:19:41,212 --> 01:19:42,589
Her memories...

1019
01:19:44,674 --> 01:19:46,676
I understand now.

1020
01:19:47,802 --> 01:19:50,096
I can see what she saw.

1021
01:19:51,348 --> 01:19:53,391
So many planets.

1022
01:19:54,267 --> 01:19:56,478
So much life destroyed

1023
01:19:56,561 --> 01:19:59,773
every time a Celestial is born.

1024
01:20:00,482 --> 01:20:02,359
Arishem used us

1025
01:20:02,525 --> 01:20:06,988
and left us to die
with each emergence.

1026
01:20:07,155 --> 01:20:08,782
We just wanted to survive.

1027
01:20:11,243 --> 01:20:13,370
And then he sent you.

1028
01:20:14,663 --> 01:20:16,331
I will kill you all

1029
01:20:16,414 --> 01:20:18,833
for what you have done to my kind.

1030
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,795
You are not saviors, Eternals.

1031
01:20:22,337 --> 01:20:24,005
You are murderers.

1032
01:20:27,634 --> 01:20:28,635
Ikaris!

1033
01:20:43,692 --> 01:20:45,068
Thena.

1034
01:20:48,071 --> 01:20:49,322
Hey.

1035
01:20:51,283 --> 01:20:52,826
Remember.

1036
01:21:01,126 --> 01:21:02,586
No.

1037
01:21:04,462 --> 01:21:05,755
No.

1038
01:21:08,174 --> 01:21:10,635
I'll remember.

1039
01:21:10,802 --> 01:21:12,345
I'll remember.

1040
01:21:35,368 --> 01:21:37,287
I'll remember.

1041
01:22:19,913 --> 01:22:21,498
When I left,

1042
01:22:21,706 --> 01:22:24,542
I thought about taking over the minds

1043
01:22:24,626 --> 01:22:26,878
of every human on this planet.

1044
01:22:27,754 --> 01:22:31,049
Violence, fear, greed,

1045
01:22:31,216 --> 01:22:32,759
all gone.

1046
01:22:32,926 --> 01:22:34,094
Why didn't you?

1047
01:22:34,261 --> 01:22:36,846
Because without their flaws,

1048
01:22:37,389 --> 01:22:39,307
they wouldn't be human.

1049
01:22:42,310 --> 01:22:45,313
Please, Druig.
You can't stay here anymore.

1050
01:22:46,064 --> 01:22:47,691
These Deviants are trying to keep us

1051
01:22:47,774 --> 01:22:49,526
from killing their own kind.

1052
01:22:49,693 --> 01:22:51,444
They have a conscience now.

1053
01:22:51,528 --> 01:22:52,672
That makes them more dangerous.

1054
01:22:52,696 --> 01:22:54,614
No, Sersi.

1055
01:22:55,699 --> 01:22:58,118
That makes them us.

1056
01:22:58,827 --> 01:23:00,787
Eternals and Deviants.

1057
01:23:01,997 --> 01:23:03,623
Arishem's children.

1058
01:23:04,791 --> 01:23:06,751
But you are asking me to take control

1059
01:23:06,835 --> 01:23:08,545
of a mind of a Celestial.

1060
01:23:08,753 --> 01:23:11,965
I do not have that kind of power.

1061
01:23:12,132 --> 01:23:13,842
We'll need Phastos.

1062
01:23:16,386 --> 01:23:17,804
Well, good luck.

1063
01:23:18,638 --> 01:23:21,558
He gave up on humans
a long time ago.

1064
01:23:54,215 --> 01:23:55,508
I did this.

1065
01:23:57,427 --> 01:23:59,763
If my technology
hadn't helped them advance...

1066
01:24:05,185 --> 01:24:07,062
Druig was right.

1067
01:24:07,938 --> 01:24:10,023
Our mission was a mistake.

1068
01:24:10,649 --> 01:24:12,233
These people...

1069
01:24:14,027 --> 01:24:15,278
they're not worth saving.

1070
01:24:15,445 --> 01:24:17,280
Oh, Phastos.

1071
01:24:17,447 --> 01:24:18,907
They're not worth saving.

1072
01:24:31,044 --> 01:24:32,796
- Thanks.
- Give me a good one.

1073
01:24:32,963 --> 01:24:34,339
- All right.
- Over here.

1074
01:24:34,506 --> 01:24:35,632
And...

1075
01:24:35,715 --> 01:24:36,758
Oh, that's great, man!

1076
01:24:36,841 --> 01:24:37,926
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1077
01:24:38,009 --> 01:24:39,135
- Oh, yeah!
- Nice.

1078
01:24:39,219 --> 01:24:40,539
Good one.
All right, ready? Throw!

1079
01:24:41,346 --> 01:24:42,514
Oh, so close.

1080
01:24:42,597 --> 01:24:43,783
- Daddy, Daddy, watch this.
- Yeah, okay.

1081
01:24:43,807 --> 01:24:45,767
- Watch this.
- Let me see. Let me see it.

1082
01:24:46,935 --> 01:24:48,478
Dad. I'm only a starter.

1083
01:24:48,645 --> 01:24:49,646
Hi.

1084
01:24:49,813 --> 01:24:52,190
- Hello. Can we help you?
- Throw it again.

1085
01:24:52,357 --> 01:24:55,443
Hey, Jack. Ben.

1086
01:24:56,236 --> 01:24:59,614
Hey, guys.
These are my friends from college.

1087
01:25:01,950 --> 01:25:06,955
Uh, this is Sylvia
and, uh, Isaac. That's Isaac.

1088
01:25:07,414 --> 01:25:09,457
- Isaac.
- Dad, that's Superman.

1089
01:25:09,624 --> 01:25:10,709
Dad, that's Superman!

1090
01:25:10,792 --> 01:25:11,978
Jack... That's really funny, Jack.

1091
01:25:12,002 --> 01:25:13,044
No, no! He is Superman.

1092
01:25:13,128 --> 01:25:14,313
That is definitely not Superman.

1093
01:25:14,337 --> 01:25:15,505
I saw him on TV.

1094
01:25:15,589 --> 01:25:18,258
He was in London, fighting a monster.

1095
01:25:18,883 --> 01:25:20,427
And you were with a cape

1096
01:25:20,510 --> 01:25:22,510
and you were shooting
laser beams out of your eyes.

1097
01:25:23,013 --> 01:25:24,514
- I don't wear a cape.
- Oh, sorry.

1098
01:25:24,598 --> 01:25:26,433
Okay, well, we should
just go inside, right?

1099
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:27,851
Can I call you Clark?

1100
01:25:27,934 --> 01:25:29,245
Is that what you go by now?
Because, you know...

1101
01:25:29,269 --> 01:25:30,895
You've called me worse.

1102
01:25:31,062 --> 01:25:32,606
- You got it, Jack?
- Mm-hmm.

1103
01:25:32,772 --> 01:25:34,733
- Way to go.
- Yes.

1104
01:25:34,816 --> 01:25:36,096
All right.
Show me how it's done.

1105
01:25:36,443 --> 01:25:39,029
Round and round and round
and round and round.

1106
01:25:42,532 --> 01:25:44,242
- Yep, you got it. Keep going.
- Come on.

1107
01:25:52,959 --> 01:25:55,921
Yeah.
Incredibly natural, guys.

1108
01:25:58,673 --> 01:26:00,759
So, after all these years,

1109
01:26:00,926 --> 01:26:03,011
even you fell for Ajak's lies.

1110
01:26:03,178 --> 01:26:05,347
- No need to rub it in.
- Mm.

1111
01:26:06,681 --> 01:26:09,059
It all makes sense
why she wouldn't let us interfere

1112
01:26:09,142 --> 01:26:10,727
with human conflicts.

1113
01:26:11,269 --> 01:26:12,938
Conflicts lead to war,

1114
01:26:13,104 --> 01:26:15,482
and war actually leads to advancement

1115
01:26:15,565 --> 01:26:17,692
in lifesaving technology and medicine.

1116
01:26:17,943 --> 01:26:19,945
So our mission was never to

1117
01:26:20,111 --> 01:26:22,864
make a peaceful or harmonious world,

1118
01:26:23,031 --> 01:26:26,785
but to increase the population
at all costs.

1119
01:26:26,952 --> 01:26:29,955
Just farming humans as food
for the Celestials, right?

1120
01:26:30,121 --> 01:26:31,122
That's bleak.

1121
01:26:31,289 --> 01:26:32,934
Well, so is telling
your husband and your child

1122
01:26:32,958 --> 01:26:34,638
that they could be dead within a few days.

1123
01:26:34,709 --> 01:26:36,795
Thought you'd given up on humans.

1124
01:26:37,545 --> 01:26:39,506
I got lucky. Okay?

1125
01:26:41,758 --> 01:26:43,802
I have a family now.

1126
01:26:43,969 --> 01:26:46,304
They give me faith again.

1127
01:26:47,389 --> 01:26:49,391
And I see the good
in humanity in them

1128
01:26:49,474 --> 01:26:51,476
every single day.

1129
01:26:51,643 --> 01:26:53,270
So, look, I cannot help you.

1130
01:26:53,436 --> 01:26:54,705
- I am never leaving them.
- Phastos...

1131
01:26:54,729 --> 01:26:55,814
I'm sorry, Sersi.

1132
01:26:55,981 --> 01:26:57,421
It was wrong for me to use my powers

1133
01:26:57,524 --> 01:26:58,793
without thinking about the consequences

1134
01:26:58,817 --> 01:26:59,818
in the first place.

1135
01:26:59,901 --> 01:27:02,445
So, now, I choose to use my hands

1136
01:27:02,529 --> 01:27:04,364
to fix my child's bicycle, okay?

1137
01:27:04,906 --> 01:27:06,116
Do you?

1138
01:27:07,158 --> 01:27:08,368
I don't use my powers anymore.

1139
01:27:08,535 --> 01:27:09,661
You sure?

1140
01:27:09,744 --> 01:27:10,870
What are you...

1141
01:27:14,416 --> 01:27:16,459
What the hell is wrong with you?

1142
01:27:16,543 --> 01:27:17,895
My child is right down the hallway!

1143
01:27:17,919 --> 01:27:19,921
That looks like someone's
been using his powers.

1144
01:27:20,088 --> 01:27:21,190
- Oh, my God.
- I bet you've built

1145
01:27:21,214 --> 01:27:22,299
the perfect safe house.

1146
01:27:22,465 --> 01:27:23,550
What is this even made of?

1147
01:27:23,633 --> 01:27:24,801
- Vibranium?
- Don't!

1148
01:27:29,306 --> 01:27:30,807
Fall collection.

1149
01:27:30,974 --> 01:27:32,225
IKEA.

1150
01:27:32,392 --> 01:27:33,393
Ass.

1151
01:27:33,560 --> 01:27:35,061
How did you even
deal with this guy

1152
01:27:35,145 --> 01:27:36,271
for over 5,000 years?

1153
01:27:36,438 --> 01:27:37,897
If you stay here, you might as well

1154
01:27:37,981 --> 01:27:39,166
invite the Deviants to dinner.

1155
01:27:39,190 --> 01:27:40,910
Never mind waiting
for the end of the world.

1156
01:27:40,984 --> 01:27:42,235
He has a point.

1157
01:27:42,402 --> 01:27:44,029
No, I'm sorry. You can't just show up

1158
01:27:44,112 --> 01:27:45,548
in my life and expect me to go with you.

1159
01:27:45,572 --> 01:27:47,574
- I'm not gonna...
- You should go, <i>habibi.</i>

1160
01:27:48,366 --> 01:27:49,659
You want me to go?

1161
01:27:49,826 --> 01:27:50,911
You know what my mom

1162
01:27:50,994 --> 01:27:52,662
would say to you right now,
right?

1163
01:27:52,787 --> 01:27:56,791
Quit procrastinating, Phil,
and take care of your business.

1164
01:27:56,958 --> 01:27:58,251
He's a chronic procrastinator.

1165
01:27:58,418 --> 01:28:00,378
I'm not leaving you two. No way.

1166
01:28:00,545 --> 01:28:02,339
I'm not happy about it,

1167
01:28:03,006 --> 01:28:04,841
but if there's a chance for us to watch

1168
01:28:04,925 --> 01:28:06,402
Jack grow up to live a life of his own,

1169
01:28:06,426 --> 01:28:08,136
we should take it.

1170
01:28:14,643 --> 01:28:17,646
<i>Why does my heart Go on beating?</i>

1171
01:28:22,275 --> 01:28:27,072
<i>Why do these eyes of mine cry?</i>

1172
01:28:29,658 --> 01:28:35,247
<i>Don't they know
It's the end of the world?</i>

1173
01:28:36,706 --> 01:28:41,711
<i>♪ It ended when you said goodbye ♪</i>

1174
01:28:42,295 --> 01:28:47,217
<i>♪ Why does my heart
Go on beating? ♪</i>

1175
01:28:49,427 --> 01:28:53,556
{\an8}<i>♪ Why do these eyes of mine cry? ♪</i>

1176
01:28:56,351 --> 01:29:03,275
<i>♪ Don't they know ♪
♪ It's the end of the world? ♪</i>

1177
01:29:03,441 --> 01:29:10,198
<i>♪ It ended when you said goodbye ♪</i>

1178
01:29:36,391 --> 01:29:38,226
The <i>Domo.</i>

1179
01:29:39,394 --> 01:29:40,895
Wow.

1180
01:29:50,739 --> 01:29:53,825
<i>A foreboding atmosphere fills the air.</i>

1181
01:29:54,659 --> 01:29:57,537
<i>An eerie stillness chokes our lungs.</i>

1182
01:29:57,704 --> 01:29:58,705
<i>What are you doing?</i>

1183
01:29:58,788 --> 01:30:00,391
<i>You know you're creeping us out.
You know that, right?</i>

1184
01:30:00,415 --> 01:30:01,458
<i>Oh! Oh, God!</i>

1185
01:30:01,541 --> 01:30:03,335
<i>Stay calm, T, please!</i>

1186
01:30:07,130 --> 01:30:09,507
<i>Chips. It's just chips.</i>

1187
01:30:09,925 --> 01:30:11,509
<i>As you can see, being an Eternal</i>

1188
01:30:11,593 --> 01:30:14,095
<i>does not preclude you
from having human emotions</i>

1189
01:30:14,262 --> 01:30:16,056
<i>such as cowardice.</i>

1190
01:30:18,558 --> 01:30:20,143
What has she done?

1191
01:30:20,644 --> 01:30:23,980
Is that... a sarcophagus in my lab?

1192
01:30:25,273 --> 01:30:28,526
This is Makkari.
Or should I say Miss Havisham?

1193
01:30:28,693 --> 01:30:30,403
None of us have seen her
for centuries.

1194
01:30:31,821 --> 01:30:34,366
Ready to go home?

1195
01:30:35,242 --> 01:30:36,534
Hmm.

1196
01:30:54,302 --> 01:30:55,345
Is that the Ebony Blade?

1197
01:30:55,512 --> 01:30:56,763
Excalibur.

1198
01:30:58,515 --> 01:31:00,058
Arthur always did have a crush on you.

1199
01:31:01,351 --> 01:31:02,852
So you mean...

1200
01:31:03,019 --> 01:31:07,232
I've been waiting for centuries
to go back to Olympia,

1201
01:31:07,399 --> 01:31:09,025
and now you're telling me...

1202
01:31:09,192 --> 01:31:10,944
it doesn't exist?

1203
01:31:11,194 --> 01:31:13,697
That, and the world is ending.

1204
01:31:15,031 --> 01:31:17,158
At last my boredom is ending.

1205
01:31:18,868 --> 01:31:20,120
Have you seen my movies?

1206
01:31:21,496 --> 01:31:23,540
I don't have a DVD player.

1207
01:31:23,873 --> 01:31:24,874
DVD?

1208
01:31:25,250 --> 01:31:26,793
It's all about streaming now.

1209
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:28,878
You know, what you need is a Kindle.

1210
01:31:29,045 --> 01:31:31,089
Do you know what that is?
It's like a...

1211
01:31:31,715 --> 01:31:32,924
You know, I just realized

1212
01:31:33,008 --> 01:31:34,568
that if you don't know what an iPad is,

1213
01:31:34,676 --> 01:31:36,803
there's almost no way
to explain it.

1214
01:31:41,016 --> 01:31:45,353
So, how did you end up scoring
this Emerald Tablet,

1215
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:48,440
my beautiful, beautiful Makkari?

1216
01:31:51,526 --> 01:31:52,902
Miss me?

1217
01:31:54,112 --> 01:31:55,798
I'm sorry, what are we watching?
Because this...

1218
01:31:55,822 --> 01:31:56,883
- Is this new?
- Are you two...

1219
01:31:56,907 --> 01:31:57,908
Because I hate it.

1220
01:31:58,074 --> 01:31:59,159
Phastos,

1221
01:31:59,242 --> 01:32:01,036
I need to control
the mind of a Celestial.

1222
01:32:01,202 --> 01:32:02,662
Okay, get ready for it.

1223
01:32:05,916 --> 01:32:07,042
Bracelets?

1224
01:32:07,542 --> 01:32:08,627
You made us bracelets?

1225
01:32:08,793 --> 01:32:10,712
So, here's a little Celestial 101.

1226
01:32:10,879 --> 01:32:12,797
Celestials are the most powerful

1227
01:32:12,881 --> 01:32:14,549
energy generators in the universe.

1228
01:32:14,716 --> 01:32:16,092
When Arishem made us,

1229
01:32:16,176 --> 01:32:17,969
he imbued us with infinite cosmic energy

1230
01:32:18,178 --> 01:32:19,679
to keep our bodies regenerating.

1231
01:32:19,763 --> 01:32:21,473
The bracelets, in theory,

1232
01:32:21,556 --> 01:32:23,516
shut down our regeneration process.

1233
01:32:23,683 --> 01:32:25,060
And once that happens,

1234
01:32:25,143 --> 01:32:26,823
our bodies accumulate extra cosmic energy.

1235
01:32:27,103 --> 01:32:28,104
What for?

1236
01:32:28,271 --> 01:32:31,066
Well, if the Deviants
can absorb our energy,

1237
01:32:31,608 --> 01:32:34,903
what if we can absorb
each other's energy as well?

1238
01:32:35,070 --> 01:32:37,572
If I can find a way to connect us all,

1239
01:32:37,739 --> 01:32:39,699
one of us could become immensely powerful,

1240
01:32:39,866 --> 01:32:42,577
pulling the accumulated energy
from the rest,

1241
01:32:42,744 --> 01:32:43,912
forming...

1242
01:32:47,457 --> 01:32:48,833
a Uni-Mind.

1243
01:32:52,587 --> 01:32:54,547
"Uni" meaning "one,"
"mind" meaning "mind."

1244
01:32:54,714 --> 01:32:55,858
Oh, no,
we heard you the first time.

1245
01:32:55,882 --> 01:32:57,362
- Terrible name.
- We'll brainstorm...

1246
01:32:57,842 --> 01:32:58,843
"Brainstorm"!

1247
01:32:59,010 --> 01:33:00,655
- That's a way better name!
- No, I invented it,

1248
01:33:00,679 --> 01:33:01,781
so I'm calling it whatever I want.

1249
01:33:01,805 --> 01:33:06,184
So suppose Druig can,
say... put Tiamut to sleep...

1250
01:33:06,351 --> 01:33:07,477
Then what?

1251
01:33:07,644 --> 01:33:10,063
We find humans a new home
on another planet.

1252
01:33:10,230 --> 01:33:11,898
Are we building a big ship, too?

1253
01:33:11,982 --> 01:33:13,066
Take a pair of each animal?

1254
01:33:13,233 --> 01:33:14,585
Well, you know
what's never saved the planet?

1255
01:33:14,609 --> 01:33:15,610
Your sarcasm.

1256
01:33:15,777 --> 01:33:17,612
Space colonization
could take decades.

1257
01:33:17,779 --> 01:33:19,219
It can happen quickly with our help.

1258
01:33:19,322 --> 01:33:21,741
What if we end up
accidentally killing Tiamut?

1259
01:33:21,908 --> 01:33:24,035
We could be responsible
for billions of lives

1260
01:33:24,119 --> 01:33:25,662
not being created across the universe.

1261
01:33:25,829 --> 01:33:27,122
Boss, am I right?

1262
01:33:28,790 --> 01:33:30,542
Say something, Ikaris.

1263
01:33:30,709 --> 01:33:32,377
You don't think
we should be doing this.

1264
01:33:39,134 --> 01:33:41,511
Ajak chose Sersi to lead us.

1265
01:33:42,971 --> 01:33:44,848
Sersi should decide.

1266
01:33:47,475 --> 01:33:49,269
Forget who Ajak chose.

1267
01:33:49,436 --> 01:33:50,437
You're the strongest.

1268
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:52,606
You should be making this decision.

1269
01:33:53,690 --> 01:33:55,984
Fine. Just keep lying to yourself.

1270
01:33:56,151 --> 01:33:57,527
Sprite.

1271
01:34:06,661 --> 01:34:07,913
Okay, this is not...

1272
01:34:08,079 --> 01:34:09,331
- Ikaris.
- Don't run after him.

1273
01:34:09,497 --> 01:34:11,499
Kingo, I... You guys.

1274
01:34:11,917 --> 01:34:14,377
Hey. Don't sweat it.
Sprite's always cranky.

1275
01:34:14,544 --> 01:34:16,564
I used to hear her complaining
even when she wasn't there.

1276
01:34:16,588 --> 01:34:17,923
I'm okay, Kingo.

1277
01:34:18,089 --> 01:34:19,809
If you think we should
do this, I trust you.

1278
01:34:19,966 --> 01:34:22,636
I will follow you to the end,
like I always have.

1279
01:34:24,638 --> 01:34:26,139
What did you say?

1280
01:34:26,389 --> 01:34:28,850
I will follow you to the end,
like I always have.

1281
01:34:30,602 --> 01:34:32,687
I'm not who you think I am.

1282
01:35:11,893 --> 01:35:13,520
How long do we have?

1283
01:35:13,937 --> 01:35:15,522
Seven days.

1284
01:35:16,064 --> 01:35:17,357
Good.

1285
01:35:18,942 --> 01:35:21,736
We completed our mission.

1286
01:35:23,780 --> 01:35:25,323
Where is she?

1287
01:35:25,490 --> 01:35:26,491
London.

1288
01:35:27,325 --> 01:35:28,910
She has a good life there.

1289
01:35:29,077 --> 01:35:31,162
I'm sure she's missed you.

1290
01:35:31,329 --> 01:35:32,455
If I'd gone back to her,

1291
01:35:32,664 --> 01:35:34,666
I would only have told her the truth.

1292
01:35:36,501 --> 01:35:38,128
She would've suffered

1293
01:35:38,295 --> 01:35:40,797
knowing this world she loves
would end one day.

1294
01:35:40,964 --> 01:35:42,132
Ikaris.

1295
01:35:43,174 --> 01:35:44,843
We have to tell them the truth.

1296
01:35:45,010 --> 01:35:46,428
What?

1297
01:35:46,803 --> 01:35:48,346
- Why?
- Because together

1298
01:35:48,513 --> 01:35:50,599
we might be able to stop the emergence.

1299
01:35:51,349 --> 01:35:53,018
"Stop the emergence"?

1300
01:35:53,184 --> 01:35:54,185
Listen...

1301
01:35:54,352 --> 01:35:55,580
Ajak, I know it's hard at the end...

1302
01:35:55,604 --> 01:35:56,605
Listen to me, Ikaris.

1303
01:35:56,688 --> 01:35:59,399
I have followed Arishem
for millions of years.

1304
01:35:59,566 --> 01:36:02,193
And I have never doubted him.

1305
01:36:02,360 --> 01:36:04,029
- Until now.
- Why now?

1306
01:36:04,988 --> 01:36:06,364
Why now?

1307
01:36:11,244 --> 01:36:13,413
Five years ago, Thanos erased

1308
01:36:13,538 --> 01:36:15,874
half of the population of the universe.

1309
01:36:17,334 --> 01:36:19,169
Delayed the emergence.

1310
01:36:21,212 --> 01:36:23,173
But the people of this planet

1311
01:36:23,340 --> 01:36:26,593
brought everyone back
with the snap of a finger.

1312
01:36:27,802 --> 01:36:30,931
You know, after I let you all go,

1313
01:36:31,097 --> 01:36:33,975
I traveled the world, living among them.

1314
01:36:34,142 --> 01:36:37,729
I have seen them fight and lie and kill,

1315
01:36:38,021 --> 01:36:40,357
but I have also seen them

1316
01:36:40,523 --> 01:36:42,943
laugh and love.

1317
01:36:43,109 --> 01:36:47,113
I've seen them create and dream.

1318
01:36:50,033 --> 01:36:51,409
This planet

1319
01:36:52,202 --> 01:36:53,787
and these people...

1320
01:36:55,247 --> 01:36:56,915
have changed me.

1321
01:36:58,625 --> 01:37:02,671
The cost of Arishem's design,
it's not worth it.

1322
01:37:02,837 --> 01:37:04,464
Not this time.

1323
01:37:06,299 --> 01:37:08,009
I trust you, Ajak.

1324
01:37:12,097 --> 01:37:13,932
I'll follow you to the end,

1325
01:37:15,433 --> 01:37:16,935
as I always have.

1326
01:37:17,102 --> 01:37:18,478
Thank you.

1327
01:37:20,105 --> 01:37:22,065
We have to bring
everyone back together.

1328
01:37:24,693 --> 01:37:27,028
There's something
I have to show you first.

1329
01:37:37,664 --> 01:37:39,332
It's just up ahead.

1330
01:37:46,840 --> 01:37:49,342
They must have been trapped
in the ice for centuries

1331
01:37:49,426 --> 01:37:50,760
and broke free last week

1332
01:37:50,844 --> 01:37:52,429
when the glacier started to melt

1333
01:37:52,512 --> 01:37:55,223
as the Earth's core heats up
for the emergence.

1334
01:37:56,516 --> 01:37:58,852
They killed an entire company
of oil workers.

1335
01:37:59,686 --> 01:38:01,313
I tracked them here.

1336
01:38:04,816 --> 01:38:07,152
I suspected you might
have changed your mind.

1337
01:38:08,320 --> 01:38:10,322
I can't let you betray Arishem.

1338
01:38:12,032 --> 01:38:14,117
Why don't you just kill me yourself?

1339
01:38:14,284 --> 01:38:15,368
When the others realize

1340
01:38:15,452 --> 01:38:17,287
something is happening to the Earth,

1341
01:38:17,954 --> 01:38:19,122
they'll come to you.

1342
01:38:19,831 --> 01:38:21,166
When they find your body,

1343
01:38:21,249 --> 01:38:22,709
they'll know the Deviants are back.

1344
01:38:23,126 --> 01:38:25,795
It'll keep them busy until the emergence.

1345
01:38:27,505 --> 01:38:29,841
I've been loyal to you, Ajak.

1346
01:38:30,175 --> 01:38:32,636
Kept your secret for centuries,

1347
01:38:32,969 --> 01:38:35,722
lied to everyone I cared about,

1348
01:38:35,889 --> 01:38:39,434
but never have I doubted my purpose

1349
01:38:39,517 --> 01:38:40,518
to serve the Celestials.

1350
01:38:41,227 --> 01:38:43,146
Oh, Ikaris.

1351
01:38:48,026 --> 01:38:50,862
I've led you down the wrong path.

1352
01:38:51,655 --> 01:38:53,073
It's the only path I know.

1353
01:41:46,830 --> 01:41:48,790
Thought I'd find you here.

1354
01:41:49,291 --> 01:41:51,710
I've thought about this place a lot.

1355
01:41:52,919 --> 01:41:55,255
Amazing how things change over time.

1356
01:41:55,839 --> 01:41:57,966
Maybe we're the ones
who've changed.

1357
01:42:00,885 --> 01:42:02,762
I know you don't agree with our plan.

1358
01:42:03,888 --> 01:42:05,241
I've always thought of the Celestials

1359
01:42:05,265 --> 01:42:06,891
like the ocean.

1360
01:42:08,727 --> 01:42:12,230
They give life and they take life away
without bias.

1361
01:42:12,647 --> 01:42:13,773
If they were gone,

1362
01:42:13,857 --> 01:42:15,358
this universe would eventually end.

1363
01:42:15,859 --> 01:42:16,943
What you're trying to do

1364
01:42:17,027 --> 01:42:18,421
is free humanity from the natural order.

1365
01:42:18,445 --> 01:42:20,447
It's not natural to allow all life

1366
01:42:20,530 --> 01:42:22,240
on an entire planet to be destroyed.

1367
01:42:22,949 --> 01:42:24,701
Arishem's way is archaic and violent.

1368
01:42:24,868 --> 01:42:26,828
I don't want to fight, Sersi.

1369
01:42:27,621 --> 01:42:28,622
It'll all end soon.

1370
01:42:28,788 --> 01:42:31,625
Except there is no end, is there?

1371
01:42:31,875 --> 01:42:34,377
We'd carry on without our memories

1372
01:42:34,544 --> 01:42:36,087
or free will

1373
01:42:36,254 --> 01:42:37,839
for eternity.

1374
01:42:43,553 --> 01:42:44,930
You're afraid.

1375
01:42:45,347 --> 01:42:47,974
I wouldn't mind leaving this world.

1376
01:42:48,683 --> 01:42:50,644
I only wish that when we do,

1377
01:42:52,228 --> 01:42:54,481
I would be able to remember you.

1378
01:42:56,566 --> 01:42:59,027
I'm in love with you, Sersi.

1379
01:42:59,486 --> 01:43:02,364
I'm grateful for the life
I've lived with you.

1380
01:43:08,536 --> 01:43:09,621
Ikaris.

1381
01:43:34,479 --> 01:43:35,772
Sersi?

1382
01:43:39,776 --> 01:43:41,945
It's started.

1383
01:43:44,656 --> 01:43:46,324
Oh, no. My God.

1384
01:43:46,908 --> 01:43:47,909
What about the Uni-Mind?

1385
01:43:48,368 --> 01:43:49,619
I haven't figured out a way

1386
01:43:49,744 --> 01:43:51,329
to connect us, but I'm close.

1387
01:43:51,413 --> 01:43:53,053
- I'm very, very close.
- How much longer?

1388
01:43:53,123 --> 01:43:55,125
I don't know, Sersi!

1389
01:43:58,336 --> 01:43:59,671
Find the point of emergence.

1390
01:44:23,570 --> 01:44:26,114
You always knew
the end was coming.

1391
01:44:26,281 --> 01:44:28,909
It must be a relief.

1392
01:44:29,075 --> 01:44:31,077
That Deviant is still tracking us.

1393
01:44:31,786 --> 01:44:34,331
Revenge won't bring peace
for you, Thena.

1394
01:44:34,831 --> 01:44:37,042
But killing it might.

1395
01:44:50,138 --> 01:44:51,556
Ikaris?

1396
01:44:52,974 --> 01:44:54,434
What are you doing?

1397
01:45:00,398 --> 01:45:03,026
I wanted you to leave
this world in peace.

1398
01:45:04,402 --> 01:45:06,780
Without knowing
about the emergence.

1399
01:45:07,155 --> 01:45:08,740
But I failed.

1400
01:45:12,577 --> 01:45:14,287
I wish Ajak hadn't chosen you.

1401
01:45:21,503 --> 01:45:22,837
I'm close to figuring it out.

1402
01:45:27,342 --> 01:45:28,635
Boss, what are you doing?

1403
01:45:28,802 --> 01:45:30,303
I've let this go on long enough.

1404
01:45:30,470 --> 01:45:32,389
Don't hurt him!

1405
01:45:33,515 --> 01:45:35,100
He lied to us.

1406
01:45:35,976 --> 01:45:37,727
He already knew about the emergence.

1407
01:45:38,436 --> 01:45:39,771
No, he didn't.

1408
01:45:39,938 --> 01:45:42,649
Ajak told me everything
when we left Babylon.

1409
01:45:44,025 --> 01:45:45,026
What?

1410
01:45:46,027 --> 01:45:48,363
You were never gonna let us
stop the emergence.

1411
01:45:48,530 --> 01:45:49,531
No.

1412
01:45:50,824 --> 01:45:53,493
I only wanted to protect you
from the Deviants.

1413
01:45:53,827 --> 01:45:55,495
If Ajak wanted you to take her place,

1414
01:45:55,579 --> 01:45:57,122
why did she choose me?

1415
01:46:02,085 --> 01:46:03,336
What have you done?

1416
01:46:04,671 --> 01:46:06,298
He killed her.

1417
01:46:09,050 --> 01:46:10,051
I had to.

1418
01:46:11,469 --> 01:46:13,346
She loved you.

1419
01:46:16,141 --> 01:46:17,809
- Did she?
- She loved you.

1420
01:46:20,186 --> 01:46:22,522
Do you think it was easy
to live with the truth?

1421
01:46:23,523 --> 01:46:25,525
To know that one day all this would end?

1422
01:46:27,652 --> 01:46:29,988
To keep on lying to you?

1423
01:46:31,448 --> 01:46:33,658
If we gave humanity the choice,

1424
01:46:33,742 --> 01:46:36,119
how many of them would be willing to die

1425
01:46:36,202 --> 01:46:38,830
so that billions more could be born?

1426
01:46:38,997 --> 01:46:41,374
We're not giving them a choice.

1427
01:46:42,167 --> 01:46:44,753
Is this why you're willing to kill?

1428
01:46:46,504 --> 01:46:49,174
You are so pathetic!

1429
01:46:49,591 --> 01:46:51,885
I'm an Eternal, Phastos.

1430
01:46:52,510 --> 01:46:55,555
I exist for Arishem.

1431
01:46:55,722 --> 01:46:56,973
As do you.

1432
01:46:57,474 --> 01:46:58,475
It's who you are.

1433
01:46:58,642 --> 01:47:01,770
I wouldn't change a single thing

1434
01:47:01,853 --> 01:47:03,313
about who I am.

1435
01:47:03,480 --> 01:47:05,440
Born or made.

1436
01:47:05,607 --> 01:47:08,068
But I do not exist for Arishem,

1437
01:47:08,151 --> 01:47:10,111
I exist for my family!

1438
01:47:10,278 --> 01:47:12,697
Then you are making
the same mistake Ajak did.

1439
01:47:14,574 --> 01:47:15,575
I found Tiamut.

1440
01:47:15,742 --> 01:47:16,952
- No!
- Makkari!

1441
01:47:19,287 --> 01:47:20,747
Get out of here!

1442
01:47:23,792 --> 01:47:25,168
Kingo.

1443
01:47:33,093 --> 01:47:35,679
You do not turn against your family.

1444
01:47:36,596 --> 01:47:38,974
Gilgamesh died because of you.

1445
01:47:40,892 --> 01:47:42,352
You won't succeed against me.

1446
01:47:43,353 --> 01:47:45,939
And I will kill every one of you
if I have to.

1447
01:47:53,655 --> 01:47:54,781
Wait.

1448
01:47:55,740 --> 01:47:56,783
I'm going with you.

1449
01:47:56,950 --> 01:47:57,993
Sprite...

1450
01:47:59,786 --> 01:48:00,829
What is this?

1451
01:48:14,593 --> 01:48:16,511
Why did Sprite go with Ikaris?

1452
01:48:18,346 --> 01:48:20,181
Because she loves him.

1453
01:48:21,975 --> 01:48:24,436
Oh, you guys didn't pick up on that?

1454
01:48:25,604 --> 01:48:27,772
He really fooled us, didn't he?

1455
01:48:28,648 --> 01:48:29,941
Karun, let's go.

1456
01:48:30,483 --> 01:48:31,836
Wait, where the hell are you going?

1457
01:48:31,860 --> 01:48:33,778
I can't help you guys.

1458
01:48:34,779 --> 01:48:36,406
I still think Ikaris is right.

1459
01:48:36,573 --> 01:48:39,075
So, that's it, huh?
Just gonna follow him?

1460
01:48:40,410 --> 01:48:42,412
I love the people of this planet.

1461
01:48:42,871 --> 01:48:45,165
But if you stop this emergence,

1462
01:48:45,332 --> 01:48:47,709
you are preventing so many
other worlds like this one

1463
01:48:47,876 --> 01:48:49,461
from being created.

1464
01:48:50,170 --> 01:48:52,005
I still have faith in Arishem.

1465
01:48:52,464 --> 01:48:55,634
But I refuse to hurt any of you
for my beliefs.

1466
01:49:00,347 --> 01:49:01,431
We need you.

1467
01:49:01,598 --> 01:49:04,184
Even with my help, we're no match.

1468
01:49:04,935 --> 01:49:06,603
It's Ikaris.

1469
01:49:09,981 --> 01:49:10,982
But...

1470
01:49:11,775 --> 01:49:13,652
I hope to see you on the next planet.

1471
01:49:17,948 --> 01:49:20,533
Thank you for all you've done...

1472
01:49:21,826 --> 01:49:23,870
for humanity.

1473
01:49:24,788 --> 01:49:27,624
It's been a great honor.

1474
01:49:29,960 --> 01:49:32,170
I will miss you all.

1475
01:49:41,263 --> 01:49:42,264
Look,

1476
01:49:42,973 --> 01:49:45,976
if I'm gonna get myself killed
going up against Ikaris,

1477
01:49:46,768 --> 01:49:48,645
we'll need to have a backup plan.

1478
01:49:48,812 --> 01:49:50,572
All of our powers,
even if they're amplified,

1479
01:49:50,689 --> 01:49:52,329
are not enough to kill a Celestial, so...

1480
01:49:52,399 --> 01:49:54,943
Well, Sersi did turn
a Deviant into a tree.

1481
01:49:55,944 --> 01:49:57,028
I'm sorry, what?

1482
01:49:57,487 --> 01:49:58,780
You didn't wanna tell me that?

1483
01:49:59,322 --> 01:50:01,032
You've never been able to do it before.

1484
01:50:01,241 --> 01:50:02,659
I don't know how it happened, okay?

1485
01:50:02,826 --> 01:50:05,245
And I'm pretty sure
I couldn't do it again.

1486
01:50:05,412 --> 01:50:07,956
Well, now is the time
to try, don't you think?

1487
01:50:08,123 --> 01:50:10,083
Phastos, that Deviant is dead.

1488
01:50:10,250 --> 01:50:13,461
Our plan is to put Tiamut to sleep,
not to kill it.

1489
01:50:13,628 --> 01:50:15,005
I can't kill a Celestial.

1490
01:50:15,171 --> 01:50:16,798
Sersi. Sersi.

1491
01:50:16,965 --> 01:50:18,341
We can't!

1492
01:50:24,306 --> 01:50:25,432
We can't.

1493
01:50:25,599 --> 01:50:27,142
It's okay, Sersi.

1494
01:50:28,476 --> 01:50:29,853
I got this.

1495
01:50:46,036 --> 01:50:47,662
There's no time for that.

1496
01:50:48,830 --> 01:50:51,541
I didn't see the lies
right in front of me.

1497
01:50:52,834 --> 01:50:55,712
I'm not even sure
why Ajak chose me to lead.

1498
01:50:57,255 --> 01:50:58,798
I asked Gilgamesh once

1499
01:50:59,299 --> 01:51:01,635
why he chose to protect me.

1500
01:51:02,052 --> 01:51:03,470
He said,

1501
01:51:03,929 --> 01:51:07,265
"When you love something,
you protect it."

1502
01:51:07,974 --> 01:51:12,604
"It is the most natural thing
in the world."

1503
01:51:15,273 --> 01:51:19,819
You have loved these people
since the day we arrived.

1504
01:51:21,196 --> 01:51:26,618
So, there is no one better
to lead us now than you.

1505
01:51:29,120 --> 01:51:30,413
Sersi.

1506
01:51:32,666 --> 01:51:34,000
Get up.

1507
01:51:41,925 --> 01:51:44,386
Ajak chose you for a reason.

1508
01:51:49,349 --> 01:51:50,600
Sersi!

1509
01:51:51,059 --> 01:51:52,102
Sersi!

1510
01:51:52,269 --> 01:51:53,853
Oh, Sersi. We need you!

1511
01:51:54,020 --> 01:51:55,563
I already gave that speech.

1512
01:51:55,730 --> 01:51:56,773
What?

1513
01:51:56,940 --> 01:51:58,191
You did... What...

1514
01:51:58,358 --> 01:52:01,361
Sersi, the sphere inside of you,

1515
01:52:01,528 --> 01:52:03,172
it creates a connection
between you and Arishem.

1516
01:52:03,196 --> 01:52:06,324
Maybe I can repurpose it

1517
01:52:06,491 --> 01:52:08,743
and create a connection between, uh,

1518
01:52:09,244 --> 01:52:10,245
well, all of us.

1519
01:52:10,704 --> 01:52:12,998
And that can activate the Uni-Mind.

1520
01:52:13,164 --> 01:52:14,833
- Great.
- Yeah.

1521
01:52:15,542 --> 01:52:16,751
But, um...

1522
01:52:16,835 --> 01:52:19,671
I have to take it out of you.

1523
01:52:22,591 --> 01:52:23,800
Okay.

1524
01:52:25,302 --> 01:52:26,386
Do it.

1525
01:52:28,013 --> 01:52:29,139
Okay.

1526
01:52:37,147 --> 01:52:38,732
Don't kill her.

1527
01:52:38,898 --> 01:52:40,108
Thena...

1528
01:52:41,359 --> 01:52:42,402
Do it.

1529
01:52:56,041 --> 01:52:57,334
Will it work?

1530
01:53:02,047 --> 01:53:03,465
It has to.

1531
01:53:55,308 --> 01:53:57,102
I'm glad you're here.

1532
01:54:01,273 --> 01:54:02,857
Thank you, Sprite.

1533
01:54:17,872 --> 01:54:19,541
Protect the emergence.

1534
01:54:19,708 --> 01:54:21,459
You're really gonna kill them?

1535
01:54:29,301 --> 01:54:30,844
Where's Druig?

1536
01:54:31,386 --> 01:54:32,596
He's busy.

1537
01:54:32,762 --> 01:54:34,848
Thena, play nice.

1538
01:54:38,643 --> 01:54:40,020
You've never had to fight me.

1539
01:54:40,186 --> 01:54:41,313
But I've always wanted to.

1540
01:54:49,738 --> 01:54:51,948
It's time to put a god to sleep.

1541
01:55:59,432 --> 01:56:01,268
I should've done this
five centuries ago.

1542
01:56:48,523 --> 01:56:50,025
Druig's gone.

1543
01:56:50,942 --> 01:56:52,319
It's over.

1544
01:57:59,636 --> 01:58:00,637
Phastos.

1545
01:58:05,058 --> 01:58:06,851
I have to try and stop this.

1546
01:58:07,018 --> 01:58:08,728
I need to get closer to Tiamut.

1547
01:58:08,895 --> 01:58:10,855
- Keep Ikaris busy.
- We've got you.

1548
01:58:11,022 --> 01:58:12,023
Go.

1549
01:58:19,990 --> 01:58:21,616
Enough.

1550
01:58:51,938 --> 01:58:53,189
Thena, stop!

1551
01:59:25,305 --> 01:59:26,681
Why are you helping Ikaris?

1552
01:59:27,557 --> 01:59:28,934
We can't
let it absorb our powers.

1553
01:59:30,268 --> 01:59:31,394
Too late.

1554
01:59:33,021 --> 01:59:35,649
Thena, he's trying
to goad you. Don't...

1555
01:59:51,539 --> 01:59:52,874
Makkari!

1556
02:00:01,716 --> 02:00:02,926
Where's Sersi?

1557
02:00:03,301 --> 02:00:05,470
You always did
underestimate her.

1558
02:00:06,930 --> 02:00:08,181
Oh, no.

1559
02:00:09,015 --> 02:00:10,642
Not so fast.

1560
02:00:15,063 --> 02:00:16,439
Boss.

1561
02:00:20,610 --> 02:00:21,611
I don't know about you,

1562
02:00:21,695 --> 02:00:23,488
but this is really satisfying, right?

1563
02:00:23,655 --> 02:00:25,991
Let me go, Phastos!
I can't let her do this!

1564
02:00:26,157 --> 02:00:27,450
I don't think so.

1565
02:00:27,867 --> 02:00:29,178
I've been wanting to clip your wings

1566
02:00:29,202 --> 02:00:31,329
for a long time, Ikaris!

1567
02:00:44,634 --> 02:00:45,635
Thena.

1568
02:00:48,346 --> 02:00:51,266
Oh, you've changed.

1569
02:00:52,642 --> 02:00:54,269
You're broken.

1570
02:00:55,061 --> 02:00:56,563
Damaged.

1571
02:00:57,147 --> 02:00:58,982
Useless.

1572
02:01:01,234 --> 02:01:05,071
You can't protect any of them.

1573
02:01:19,169 --> 02:01:20,545
Sersi.

1574
02:01:25,300 --> 02:01:28,219
You're not powerful enough
to do this.

1575
02:01:28,386 --> 02:01:30,305
And you won't.

1576
02:01:30,722 --> 02:01:32,474
You're not a killer.

1577
02:01:32,641 --> 02:01:34,225
Maybe I've changed.

1578
02:01:34,684 --> 02:01:37,145
And is this really who you are, Sprite?

1579
02:01:37,312 --> 02:01:39,940
Are you really willing to let
everyone on this planet die?

1580
02:01:48,740 --> 02:01:50,533
I'm sorry, Sersi.

1581
02:02:03,004 --> 02:02:05,215
I've always envied you, Sersi.

1582
02:02:07,300 --> 02:02:09,344
'Cause you get to live
as one of them.

1583
02:02:09,886 --> 02:02:10,971
And I never could.

1584
02:02:12,222 --> 02:02:14,474
You know why I hated
living with humans?

1585
02:02:15,058 --> 02:02:16,410
Because they reminded me of things

1586
02:02:16,434 --> 02:02:17,852
I didn't even know I wanted.

1587
02:02:18,353 --> 02:02:19,771
Because of them, now I wanna know

1588
02:02:19,854 --> 02:02:21,690
what it feels like to grow up.

1589
02:02:22,816 --> 02:02:24,526
To fall in love.

1590
02:02:25,318 --> 02:02:26,945
To have a family.

1591
02:02:28,238 --> 02:02:31,908
And to know, in the end, I've lived.

1592
02:02:39,082 --> 02:02:40,208
It's all over now.

1593
02:02:41,042 --> 02:02:43,378
We get to start over somewhere new.

1594
02:02:47,299 --> 02:02:48,925
Well, that was very moving.

1595
02:02:49,092 --> 02:02:50,343
Druig.

1596
02:02:56,057 --> 02:02:57,601
I can't do this.

1597
02:03:01,229 --> 02:03:03,106
This is your fight now.

1598
02:03:47,651 --> 02:03:48,860
Thena.

1599
02:03:50,236 --> 02:03:51,488
It's me.

1600
02:03:52,072 --> 02:03:53,240
Gilgamesh.

1601
02:03:54,658 --> 02:03:55,700
Look at me.

1602
02:03:56,743 --> 02:03:58,036
Gilgamesh?

1603
02:03:58,203 --> 02:03:59,746
Stay here.

1604
02:04:02,457 --> 02:04:03,708
Say it.

1605
02:04:04,251 --> 02:04:05,919
Stay here.

1606
02:04:06,795 --> 02:04:08,505
You'll be okay.

1607
02:04:10,548 --> 02:04:12,384
Give me your hand.

1608
02:04:25,647 --> 02:04:26,856
Ah, it's a shame.

1609
02:04:28,900 --> 02:04:30,527
You and I,

1610
02:04:31,111 --> 02:04:33,029
we're just tools of a god.

1611
02:04:34,406 --> 02:04:37,617
Built to kill.

1612
02:04:40,453 --> 02:04:41,705
Thena.

1613
02:04:45,166 --> 02:04:46,543
Remember.

1614
02:05:16,990 --> 02:05:18,575
I remember.

1615
02:06:47,998 --> 02:06:49,457
Come on, Sersi.

1616
02:06:50,500 --> 02:06:51,585
Come on.

1617
02:09:00,839 --> 02:09:02,591
It's beautiful, isn't it?

1618
02:11:31,573 --> 02:11:33,116
I'm sorry.

1619
02:11:34,826 --> 02:11:36,286
I know.

1620
02:12:51,987 --> 02:12:53,029
How?

1621
02:12:53,488 --> 02:12:54,864
How did you do it?

1622
02:12:55,991 --> 02:12:59,244
When I touched Tiamut's palm,
I felt energy surging into me.

1623
02:12:59,661 --> 02:13:02,038
Tiamut joined our Uni-Mind.

1624
02:13:02,205 --> 02:13:03,540
I always wondered how we survived

1625
02:13:03,707 --> 02:13:06,376
the destruction of other planets
that we were on.

1626
02:13:06,751 --> 02:13:09,254
By being connected to
the Celestial as it emerged.

1627
02:13:21,891 --> 02:13:24,769
We became one...

1628
02:13:26,938 --> 02:13:29,691
even Ikaris and Sprite

1629
02:13:30,567 --> 02:13:35,906
all because of Tiamut.

1630
02:14:12,901 --> 02:14:14,110
Is he gone?

1631
02:14:23,787 --> 02:14:25,038
Sprite.

1632
02:14:27,540 --> 02:14:30,126
I still have energy from the Uni-Mind.

1633
02:14:31,211 --> 02:14:33,380
I think I can make you human.

1634
02:14:34,756 --> 02:14:37,676
All the things you said you wanted,
you can have them.

1635
02:14:37,842 --> 02:14:40,679
But your time will be fleeting
and you'll die one day.

1636
02:14:40,845 --> 02:14:41,888
Are you ready for that?

1637
02:14:44,307 --> 02:14:45,725
I am.

1638
02:15:23,138 --> 02:15:24,179
<i>The sudden appearance</i>

1639
02:15:24,264 --> 02:15:26,808
{\an8}<i>of an enormous stone figure
in the Indian Ocean</i>

1640
02:15:26,933 --> 02:15:30,228
{\an8}<i>has left more questions
than answers for authorities.</i>

1641
02:15:30,604 --> 02:15:32,480
<i>U.S. and Australian naval ships</i>

1642
02:15:32,563 --> 02:15:34,107
<i>are maintaining defensive positions,</i>

1643
02:15:34,274 --> 02:15:35,275
<i>but at this...</i>

1644
02:15:35,442 --> 02:15:37,319
You guys did that?

1645
02:15:38,111 --> 02:15:40,405
I love you so much.

1646
02:15:47,704 --> 02:15:49,080
Are you okay?

1647
02:15:49,998 --> 02:15:52,000
I get confused sometimes.

1648
02:15:52,208 --> 02:15:54,251
Yeah. Me, too.

1649
02:15:56,838 --> 02:15:59,132
So, Dad said
you're the goddess Athena.

1650
02:15:59,299 --> 02:16:01,384
"Thena." Drop the "A."

1651
02:16:02,552 --> 02:16:03,803
- Oh.
- Hmm.

1652
02:16:04,262 --> 02:16:06,097
What's your superpower?

1653
02:16:09,976 --> 02:16:12,228
Um, can you just...
Look... One second.

1654
02:16:12,979 --> 02:16:14,606
Okay. All right.

1655
02:16:15,148 --> 02:16:16,857
See, that thing is... Okay.

1656
02:16:17,025 --> 02:16:18,669
Almost gave you a shave
and a haircut, didn't she?

1657
02:16:18,693 --> 02:16:20,152
Stand behind me, actually.

1658
02:16:20,362 --> 02:16:21,571
Um, you remember earmuffs?

1659
02:16:21,655 --> 02:16:24,241
Remember how we practiced earmuffs?
Thank you so much.

1660
02:16:26,409 --> 02:16:28,049
You know that your babysitting privileges

1661
02:16:28,119 --> 02:16:29,262
are completely revoked, right?

1662
02:16:29,286 --> 02:16:30,330
Like, it's done.

1663
02:16:30,830 --> 02:16:32,706
Thank you.
Violence... Hey.

1664
02:16:32,874 --> 02:16:34,625
Violence is never the answer.

1665
02:16:34,709 --> 02:16:35,710
- Right, T?
- Hmm.

1666
02:16:35,876 --> 02:16:38,505
You gotta always use
your brain, hmm?

1667
02:16:38,671 --> 02:16:40,382
Like you did fighting on the beach?

1668
02:16:40,548 --> 02:16:41,800
Your dad

1669
02:16:41,967 --> 02:16:43,509
spoke calmly and firmly to the bad guy

1670
02:16:43,634 --> 02:16:44,844
and he had no choice but to

1671
02:16:44,928 --> 02:16:46,088
listen to me, so no violence.

1672
02:16:46,137 --> 02:16:47,472
The kid is ten...

1673
02:16:47,973 --> 02:16:49,432
not stupid!

1674
02:16:50,058 --> 02:16:51,702
When are you guys leaving?
When is that happening?

1675
02:16:51,726 --> 02:16:53,603
That's happening soon, right?

1676
02:16:53,769 --> 02:16:54,980
Ah, yes, there's Druig.

1677
02:16:55,062 --> 02:16:56,606
- Don't go anywhere near him.
- Oh!

1678
02:16:57,148 --> 02:16:58,275
Yeah!

1679
02:17:00,694 --> 02:17:02,027
Okay, that's far enough, Jack.

1680
02:17:02,195 --> 02:17:04,531
Wow, Dad, the <i>Domo's</i> so cool.

1681
02:17:04,697 --> 02:17:06,324
Your dad fixed that
with his bare hands.

1682
02:17:06,491 --> 02:17:08,076
Can we go to space, too, one day?

1683
02:17:08,242 --> 02:17:10,745
Let's wait till you get
your learner's permit, okay?

1684
02:17:11,621 --> 02:17:13,039
Hey, Phastos.

1685
02:17:13,873 --> 02:17:15,250
Take care.

1686
02:17:15,625 --> 02:17:17,210
This world is lucky to have you.

1687
02:17:18,044 --> 02:17:19,670
Thank you.

1688
02:17:19,838 --> 02:17:21,506
I know you're not a hugger, so...

1689
02:17:24,676 --> 02:17:27,220
Okay.

1690
02:17:28,679 --> 02:17:32,767
You think when we find
the other Eternals out there,

1691
02:17:32,934 --> 02:17:35,937
that they'll accept the truth
the way we did?

1692
02:17:38,063 --> 02:17:41,818
because the truth will set them free.

1693
02:17:53,872 --> 02:17:55,581
Told you that thing
was addictive.

1694
02:17:56,750 --> 02:17:57,792
Please visit?

1695
02:17:58,418 --> 02:17:59,628
I'll try.

1696
02:18:00,211 --> 02:18:01,545
When I get time off from school.

1697
02:18:01,713 --> 02:18:03,190
Oh, wow. Listen,
it's gonna be good for you

1698
02:18:03,214 --> 02:18:04,382
to be in a human environment.

1699
02:18:04,549 --> 02:18:06,343
You'll pick up some social skills.

1700
02:18:06,884 --> 02:18:08,404
Oh, you didn't think you needed those?

1701
02:18:09,596 --> 02:18:11,598
That explains so much.

1702
02:18:21,316 --> 02:18:22,858
Gonna miss you.

1703
02:18:23,401 --> 02:18:24,611
Me, too.

1704
02:18:28,281 --> 02:18:29,407
Madam.

1705
02:18:29,866 --> 02:18:31,159
Thanks, Karun.

1706
02:18:31,742 --> 02:18:34,204
Sometimes I wonder
if we did the right thing.

1707
02:18:35,830 --> 02:18:36,915
Killing Tiamut.

1708
02:18:37,081 --> 02:18:38,833
It's too late for that.

1709
02:18:39,042 --> 02:18:41,002
But you followed your heart.

1710
02:18:41,169 --> 02:18:42,629
We all did.

1711
02:18:44,839 --> 02:18:45,840
Even Ikaris.

1712
02:18:53,390 --> 02:18:55,350
Looks like someone's waiting for you.

1713
02:18:56,518 --> 02:18:58,645
He's a lot cuter in person.

1714
02:19:01,064 --> 02:19:02,148
So, after all that,

1715
02:19:02,232 --> 02:19:04,276
you still can't change me into a giraffe?

1716
02:19:04,943 --> 02:19:08,613
Well, I could next time
I'm connected to a Celestial

1717
02:19:08,780 --> 02:19:10,991
during an emergence
whilst performing a Uni-Mind.

1718
02:19:11,157 --> 02:19:13,952
Yeah. That sounds like a "no" to me.

1719
02:19:17,914 --> 02:19:19,332
What'll you do now?

1720
02:19:19,499 --> 02:19:20,792
Not sure.

1721
02:19:20,959 --> 02:19:22,961
This planet's my home, but...

1722
02:19:24,713 --> 02:19:27,424
I can't pretend to be human anymore.

1723
02:19:33,972 --> 02:19:35,557
I love you, Sersi.

1724
02:19:37,100 --> 02:19:38,184
I don't care what you are.

1725
02:19:51,990 --> 02:19:54,618
Remember when we talked about
no more secrets?

1726
02:19:54,784 --> 02:19:57,787
I have no more secrets, I promise.

1727
02:19:58,038 --> 02:19:59,539
Actually,

1728
02:19:59,706 --> 02:20:02,000
I have one I want to tell you.

1729
02:20:03,084 --> 02:20:06,046
What is it?

1730
02:20:06,588 --> 02:20:09,090
It turns out my family history is...

1731
02:20:10,008 --> 02:20:11,593
complicated.

1732
02:20:14,971 --> 02:20:16,348
Sersi?

1733
02:20:17,140 --> 02:20:18,642
Sersi, what's wrong?

1734
02:20:20,101 --> 02:20:21,436
Sersi?

1735
02:20:45,293 --> 02:20:46,670
Sersi?

1736
02:20:47,545 --> 02:20:48,797
Sersi?

1737
02:20:49,673 --> 02:20:51,841
Sersi!

1738
02:21:06,606 --> 02:21:09,985
You have chosen
to sacrifice a Celestial

1739
02:21:10,360 --> 02:21:12,779
for the people of this planet.

1740
02:21:14,072 --> 02:21:15,865
I will spare them,

1741
02:21:16,032 --> 02:21:20,745
but your memories will show
if they are worthy to live.

1742
02:21:22,247 --> 02:21:26,459
And I will return for judgment.

1743
02:21:41,808 --> 02:21:43,852
You all right, Ted?

1744
02:21:45,562 --> 02:21:47,439
Did you see that?

1745
