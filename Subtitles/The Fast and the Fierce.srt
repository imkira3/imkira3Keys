3
00:00:31,696 --> 00:00:35,067
Oh! I'm surprised you answered.
Am I interrupting something?

4
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,102
Hey, are you on an airplane?

5
00:00:37,134 --> 00:00:39,170
Yeah. I'm coming home.

6
00:00:39,204 --> 00:00:42,640
Babe. Why?
That trip was expensive.

7
00:00:42,673 --> 00:00:44,643
Yeah. Trust me. I know it
was expensive.

8
00:00:44,676 --> 00:00:48,713
But it's not really a honeymoon
when you're not there.

9
00:00:48,746 --> 00:00:50,950
Yeah. I know. But I told you
I was going to meet you

10
00:00:50,982 --> 00:00:53,018
in Sao Paulo in a
couple days, right?

11
00:00:53,051 --> 00:00:55,588
Yeah. That was three days ago.

12
00:00:58,789 --> 00:01:01,292
I'm sorry. Work's taking
longer than expected.

13
00:01:01,326 --> 00:01:05,296
Look. I'm just calling you to let you know
that I'm coming home tonight. And you're

14
00:01:05,329 --> 00:01:07,298
probably going to be busy,
so you don't have to worry about

15
00:01:07,331 --> 00:01:12,770
- picking me up at the airport.
- Don't do that, Okay? You know that hurts.

16
00:01:12,804 --> 00:01:13,671
Really?

17
00:01:13,704 --> 00:01:17,275
So you hurting my feelings,
hurts you?

18
00:01:18,143 --> 00:01:20,379
Miss, I'm not going
to tell you again-

19
00:01:20,412 --> 00:01:24,216
- All large electronic devices must be turned off. Now.
- Donna. Come on.

20
00:01:24,248 --> 00:01:27,852
Don't hang up. You said never
hang up angry.

21
00:01:33,924 --> 00:01:35,962
Can I borrow your phone?

22
00:01:36,328 --> 00:01:38,930
I hate to ask, but
my battery just died.

23
00:01:38,963 --> 00:01:42,635
- Yeah. Sure. It's no problem. It happens to me all the time.
- Thanks.

24
00:01:42,668 --> 00:01:45,037
You have such a
pretty wife, Benjy.

25
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:54,112
- I'm sorry. I don't think we actually ever met.
- No. We haven't met.

26
00:01:54,146 --> 00:01:55,614
Don't worry.

27
00:01:56,915 --> 00:01:58,817
Okay. So how do you
know who I am?

28
00:01:58,849 --> 00:02:03,054
I know everyone who created the
code for Genesis 7.

29
00:02:04,289 --> 00:02:07,326
- No. I'm sorry, you've got the wrong guy.
- Stay.

30
00:02:07,358 --> 00:02:10,028
I don't want to have
to hurt you or Donna.

31
00:02:10,062 --> 00:02:11,731
Who are you?

32
00:02:12,264 --> 00:02:15,067
Today you'll make one
of two choices.

33
00:02:18,736 --> 00:02:23,174
Either you give me the code for Genesis
7 and I'll give you ten million dollars

34
00:02:23,207 --> 00:02:27,445
in a Swiss bank account and a one
way first-class ticket to Dubai.

35
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:29,782
You'll leave tonight and
start a new life.

36
00:02:29,814 --> 00:02:35,387
Or if you don't give me the code to Genesis
7, and your wife dies in 45 minutes.

37
00:02:35,419 --> 00:02:37,789
- Maybe less.
- Okay.

38
00:02:37,823 --> 00:02:38,891
No, no, no. I get it.

39
00:02:38,924 --> 00:02:41,894
I get it. This is all Donna's
idea of a sick joke.

40
00:02:41,926 --> 00:02:45,296
- You know to get back to me...
- Yeah. You would think it's all about you, wouldn't you?

41
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:48,000
You're an Aries, right?

42
00:02:50,936 --> 00:02:52,737
- Okay. I'm done. Give me my phone.
- That's not...

43
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:58,843
- I said give me my phone!
- I said keep your voice down if you want to keep your wife safe.

44
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:05,950
First off, Donna's not even
here. She's on a plane.

45
00:03:05,984 --> 00:03:11,924
She's in the sky and the plane is set to
explode if you don't do everything I say.

46
00:03:18,864 --> 00:03:20,765
He can't help you.

47
00:03:21,432 --> 00:03:25,336
- But Homeland Security can. Let's just give them a call.
- Okay. Stop.

48
00:03:26,237 --> 00:03:29,974
Look. You had me concerned at
first. Congratulations.

49
00:03:30,008 --> 00:03:32,911
Well done. But-

50
00:03:32,943 --> 00:03:34,679
I don't even have the code.

51
00:03:34,712 --> 00:03:38,850
Okay. The code is at GioTech. And today's
a Sunday. Which means I can't even come in.

52
00:03:38,883 --> 00:03:42,287
Yeah. It should be pretty
easy to get me in.

53
00:03:47,025 --> 00:03:51,195
So why me? Huh? I mean, I'm only one of the
four project managers who worked on the code.

54
00:03:51,229 --> 00:03:52,597
Three. Actually.

55
00:03:52,631 --> 00:03:57,836
Your colleague Cliff with the wife and kid?
I went to him first.

56
00:03:59,003 --> 00:04:00,371
Yeah.

57
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:03,409
He didn't choose wisely.

58
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,051
It could have been an accident.

59
00:04:14,085 --> 00:04:16,855
They won't think that it's
an accident.

60
00:04:16,887 --> 00:04:19,824
They won't think that Donna's
death is an accident.

61
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:22,026
When they investigate the
wreckage of that plane,

62
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,963
they will discover that all of
the evidence leads to you.

63
00:04:24,995 --> 00:04:29,067
And they will even have a motive since
the two of you weren't getting along.

64
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,403
If you want my code, that's
between you and me.

65
00:04:32,437 --> 00:04:35,073
But do not bring my wife
into this.

66
00:04:35,105 --> 00:04:36,740
Oh, she's already in it.

67
00:04:36,774 --> 00:04:42,113
La Vida Airlines Flight 12-24 is up in the
air going from Sao Paulo to Los Angeles.

68
00:04:42,146 --> 00:04:45,283
Whether is stays up in the air,
it's up to you.

69
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,155
What do you even want
the code for?

70
00:04:50,187 --> 00:04:53,024
You don't get to ask questions.

71
00:04:53,057 --> 00:04:56,795
What's it gonna be,
Benjy? Make up your mind.

72
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:13,538
So-Cal Approach, this is La Vida
12-24 requesting timing for landing.

73
00:06:14,372 --> 00:06:16,141
We've been circling for
almost an hour.

74
00:06:16,173 --> 00:06:18,342
If I didn't know better, I
think you are having a

75
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:20,979
secret initiation rites
for a new captain.

76
00:06:22,447 --> 00:06:24,615
La Vida
12-24, this is So-Cal Approach.

77
00:06:24,649 --> 00:06:29,288
No hazing going on around here. You are
currently number twelve for approach.

78
00:06:30,721 --> 00:06:33,391
La Vida 12-24.
What's you fuel situation?

79
00:06:34,024 --> 00:06:36,027
We're around fifteen
thousand kilos.

80
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,029
Another hour of this...
stuff...

81
00:06:38,062 --> 00:06:40,064
we'll fall like a brick.

82
00:06:40,497 --> 00:06:42,968
<i>Stand by
for priority clearance.</i>

83
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,103
Roger, So-Cal Approach.
Thanks.

84
00:06:47,305 --> 00:06:49,107
I'm impressed.

85
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:51,009
With my looks?

86
00:06:52,576 --> 00:06:56,148
You made it through the entire
flight without cussing once.

87
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,515
I gotta watch my big mouth.

88
00:06:57,548 --> 00:07:00,385
It's part of the reason
I'm stuck in this right seat.

89
00:07:06,156 --> 00:07:09,127
Sir. Would you mind
taking a seat.

90
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,364
Miss, have a seat. Power down
your large electronics.

91
00:07:12,396 --> 00:07:15,433
We're about to go in for landing.
I know it's been a frustrating flight.

92
00:07:15,466 --> 00:07:19,437
I know you're tired. Please take your
seats. Fasten your seat belt, please.

93
00:07:19,471 --> 00:07:23,208
Turn your phones off.
I appreciate that. Thank you so much.

94
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,444
Would you mind taking a seat
for me, please? Thank you.

95
00:07:31,249 --> 00:07:33,518
Would you mind taking a seat
there, please for me.

96
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:34,752
And you as well.

97
00:07:34,786 --> 00:07:36,387
Buckle up.

98
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,389
Thank you.

99
00:07:38,423 --> 00:07:42,026
If you can take a seat,
that would be great. Thank you.

100
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:45,564
Hey Miss, do you mind taking a
seat and buckle up? Thank you.

101
00:07:45,596 --> 00:07:51,169
And if you wouldn't mind, please.
I'd appreciate that. Thank you.

102
00:07:59,444 --> 00:08:03,215
Ladies and gentlemen, if I may
please have your attention.

103
00:08:03,247 --> 00:08:07,118
I know it's been a long flight but
if you could please take a seats

104
00:08:07,151 --> 00:08:09,654
as we've been cleared for
descent. Thank you.

105
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:16,060
Stewardess!

106
00:08:16,261 --> 00:08:17,262
Yes.

107
00:08:17,295 --> 00:08:19,331
That lavatory is foul.

108
00:08:20,665 --> 00:08:23,035
I'm glad I don't have to go.

109
00:08:23,067 --> 00:08:27,572
I'm kidding. If you'll just stay seated,
I'll get it cleaned up right away, okay?

110
00:08:27,605 --> 00:08:30,509
Sir, if you'll kindly
take your seat.

111
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:35,679
I have 50-yard line seats at the Texas-UCLA
football game down at the Rose Bowl.

112
00:08:35,712 --> 00:08:39,150
I'm so jealous.
I went to UCLA.

113
00:08:39,183 --> 00:08:42,120
I've got money on Texas.
The game starts in five minutes.

114
00:08:42,153 --> 00:08:44,523
Well, we'll be on the ground
soon, okay?

115
00:08:44,556 --> 00:08:47,325
- Sir, if you will take you seat.
- Yeah, yeah.

116
00:08:47,357 --> 00:08:49,093
Don't touch.

117
00:08:57,769 --> 00:08:58,836
Yes.

118
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:01,072
We got a man down, officer.

119
00:09:01,105 --> 00:09:03,240
God. No wonder with
all this circling we've been doing.

120
00:09:03,274 --> 00:09:05,110
How are you feeling?
You okay?

121
00:09:05,143 --> 00:09:07,812
Okay. We'll be
landing soon.

122
00:09:09,647 --> 00:09:11,450
How are you feeling?

123
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:13,786
I'm on the ride of my life.

124
00:09:17,554 --> 00:09:19,223
Excuse me.

125
00:09:19,256 --> 00:09:22,693
I don't mind switching with her. Being by
the wings might help alleviate the nausea.

126
00:09:22,726 --> 00:09:24,829
Are you sure? We'll be
landing soon.

127
00:09:24,863 --> 00:09:27,466
We've been landing for an hour.
It's fine.

128
00:09:27,499 --> 00:09:31,135
That's very sweet of you. If we
weren't descending I'd buy you a drink.

129
00:09:31,168 --> 00:09:33,672
Come on, ma'am. You'll feel
better up here.

130
00:09:35,139 --> 00:09:40,711
Alright. Just take a seat
right there for me. Okay. Right this way.

131
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:53,459
- Oh my God.
- Where's my twenty dollars?

132
00:09:53,924 --> 00:09:55,693
Hi.

133
00:09:55,726 --> 00:09:58,295
Thank you so much for
spotting me last night.

134
00:09:58,328 --> 00:10:02,100
Yeah. I've never seen anyone
cry at a blackjack table.

135
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,135
I'm a sore loser.

136
00:10:04,568 --> 00:10:05,870
Mm-hmm.

137
00:10:05,903 --> 00:10:08,907
I though you weren't leaving
until next week?

138
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:13,745
Yeah, well, it's not that fun
spending your honeymoon alone, so.

139
00:10:13,778 --> 00:10:15,848
I don't think it's
supposed to be.

140
00:10:19,183 --> 00:10:21,153
I hope that-

141
00:10:21,653 --> 00:10:25,224
I hope that you don't think that
last night I was trying...

142
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:28,192
Don't. Don't worry.

143
00:10:28,225 --> 00:10:30,928
Women with wedding rings
aren't my thing.

144
00:10:30,961 --> 00:10:33,398
Besides, I have a sugar mama
I'm not about to cheat on.

145
00:10:33,431 --> 00:10:38,270
- Oh! Okay.
- I was just trying to keep you out of much trouble as possible.

146
00:10:38,836 --> 00:10:42,274
Oh, God. What kind of trouble
are we talking about?

147
00:10:42,307 --> 00:10:44,609
You got really drunk
playing craps.

148
00:10:44,642 --> 00:10:45,944
Security got mad.

149
00:10:45,976 --> 00:10:49,280
I took you to your room.
And left.

150
00:10:50,414 --> 00:10:54,752
I'm so sorry. This is really humiliating.
I never do anything like this.

151
00:10:55,485 --> 00:10:57,688
- Kurt.
- Kurt. Right. I'm Donna.

152
00:10:57,721 --> 00:11:00,558
And your husband is Benjy.

153
00:11:00,591 --> 00:11:04,528
Wow. I do not shut up when I'm
taking tequila shots apparently.

154
00:11:04,562 --> 00:11:06,364
They were actually Jäger shots.

155
00:11:06,397 --> 00:11:09,600
Oh, please stop.
This is horrible.

156
00:11:10,467 --> 00:11:13,637
Well, sometimes it's easier to talk
to a stranger than it is to a friend.

157
00:11:13,671 --> 00:11:16,708
For what it's worth, I don't
really consider you a stranger.

158
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,342
You saw me vomit.

159
00:11:20,912 --> 00:11:22,381
To friendship.

160
00:11:23,648 --> 00:11:26,918
God. What a zoo.

161
00:11:26,951 --> 00:11:30,254
I should have never agreed to switch
days with Donald.

162
00:11:30,288 --> 00:11:33,792
Donald switches schedules faster
than he switches boyfriends.

163
00:11:35,793 --> 00:11:38,629
Hey, I thought we were
out of soda.

164
00:11:39,897 --> 00:11:41,667
We are now.

165
00:11:44,668 --> 00:11:45,937
Cheers.

166
00:11:56,681 --> 00:11:59,985
La Vida 12-24, descend and
maintain twelve thousand.

167
00:12:00,018 --> 00:12:03,922
Expect vectors for
ILS seven left in four minutes.

168
00:12:03,955 --> 00:12:08,493
So-Cal Approach, La Vida 12-24
leaving flight level 2-0-0

169
00:12:08,525 --> 00:12:12,563
for twelve thousand expect
vectors in four.

170
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:18,637
Ladies and gentlemen, we've been
cleared for final descent to LAX.

171
00:12:22,874 --> 00:12:27,379
Currently at LAX the weather is
98 degrees with winds of 12 knots.

172
00:12:28,413 --> 00:12:32,049
We enjoyed having you on board.
Thank you for your patience.

173
00:12:32,082 --> 00:12:36,988
Expecting a bumpy approach into LAX,
so keep those seat belts fastened.

174
00:12:41,058 --> 00:12:41,892
Want to do the honors?

175
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:44,863
You know it's what I live for.

176
00:12:51,869 --> 00:12:53,037
Ladies and gentlemen,

177
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:56,975
as we're starting our descent to
LAX, please make sure that

178
00:12:57,008 --> 00:13:01,546
your seat backs and tray tables are
on their full and upright position.

179
00:13:01,578 --> 00:13:04,882
Also, turn off all large electronic
devices and make sure your phones

180
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:08,586
are in airplane mode until we
touch down. Thank you.

181
00:13:08,619 --> 00:13:10,522
So your husband.

182
00:13:11,556 --> 00:13:13,425
You love the guy?

183
00:13:16,059 --> 00:13:18,796
Yeah. Yeah I do.

184
00:13:19,897 --> 00:13:22,067
That's why I have to
divorce him.

185
00:13:28,806 --> 00:13:34,312
One down, 19 to go. Let's move that
traffic before wind picks up again.

186
00:13:47,457 --> 00:13:50,528
Nancy talked me into having
dinner with her later.

187
00:13:50,561 --> 00:13:52,897
The drama queen who works
for Columbia?

188
00:13:52,929 --> 00:13:54,464
Come with. I'll buy.

189
00:13:54,498 --> 00:13:59,971
No way. We're going back to the hotel
and I'm going to have a long hot bath.

190
00:14:00,004 --> 00:14:02,440
With the new captain?

191
00:14:02,472 --> 00:14:05,576
You've been checking him out ever
since pre-board in Sao Paulo.

192
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:08,746
- Have not.
- Have too.

193
00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:11,649
Hey if you don't want him, I'll gladly...

194
00:14:16,953 --> 00:14:19,623
Does no one follow
rules anymore?

195
00:14:21,491 --> 00:14:24,628
Everyone, this is a friendly
reminder that all phones and

196
00:14:24,662 --> 00:14:27,999
electronic devices should be
turned off at this time.

197
00:14:28,032 --> 00:14:29,901
Thank you.

198
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:35,506
I don't think that's a phone.

199
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,957
- Alexis, sit back down.
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

200
00:15:09,072 --> 00:15:10,741
What?

201
00:15:10,774 --> 00:15:13,144
- What did you find?
- Shh.

202
00:15:14,644 --> 00:15:16,914
Play me for the captain.

203
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:31,797
Alexis, what is
that thing?

204
00:15:36,634 --> 00:15:39,538
- Alexis, what is it?
- No, no. Shh.

205
00:15:42,572 --> 00:15:45,177
Captain, don't land that plane.

206
00:15:50,514 --> 00:15:51,982
Captain!

207
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:54,117
Alexis.

208
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:56,520
Captain, you have to hear this.

209
00:15:56,553 --> 00:15:58,655
We're all going to get really
hurt if you land this plane.

210
00:15:58,688 --> 00:16:00,625
Can't distract the captain when
he's trying to land.

211
00:16:00,658 --> 00:16:04,629
- You know how may FAA regulations you broke?
- If there's a credible threat,

212
00:16:04,662 --> 00:16:07,532
I can enter the flight deck under-
CAPTAIN: Quiet! Both of you.

213
00:16:07,565 --> 00:16:09,367
Alexis, what is this?

214
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:13,638
<i>Good afternoon,
Captain. If you land the plane, you die.</i>

215
00:16:13,671 --> 00:16:16,841
<i>Before departing Sao Paulo, an
overriding mechanism</i>

216
00:16:16,874 --> 00:16:19,110
<i>was attached to your plane's
stabilizer system.</i>

217
00:16:19,143 --> 00:16:21,812
<i>Once the aircraft descends past
1,500 feet above ground level,</i>

218
00:16:21,846 --> 00:16:25,216
<i>its guidance systems will be
programmed to malfunction.</i>

219
00:16:25,249 --> 00:16:29,988
<i>This will also jam the transponder radar,
making you undetectable to other aircraft.</i>

220
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:34,057
<i>If the plane rises above 1,500
feet or falls below 500 feet,</i>

221
00:16:34,091 --> 00:16:38,028
<i>ASL, the stabilizer system will
fail, severing the hydraulic lines</i>

222
00:16:38,062 --> 00:16:40,298
<i>and making the craft
completely uncontrollable.</i>

223
00:16:40,331 --> 00:16:42,300
<i>This will cause the plane to
break apart in mid-air,</i>

224
00:16:42,332 --> 00:16:44,836
<i>killing everyone on board and
others on the ground.</i>

225
00:16:44,869 --> 00:16:47,305
<i>If anyone gets off the plane,
I'll destroy it.</i>

226
00:16:47,337 --> 00:16:50,274
<i>If anyone tries to get on the
plane, I'll destroy it.</i>

227
00:16:50,307 --> 00:16:53,311
<i>I'm controlling the device
remotely with limited range.</i>

228
00:16:53,344 --> 00:16:56,080
<i>If you fly out of a 20 mile
radius of LAX,</i>

229
00:16:56,113 --> 00:16:59,817
<i>the device will lose my signal
and short-circuit the system.</i>

230
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:02,687
<i>I will disable the system
remotely once I get what I want.</i>

231
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,187
What's the altitude?

232
00:17:04,221 --> 00:17:07,592
- We just crossed 3,000 feet.
- You gotta pull up.

233
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:09,326
Captain?

234
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,663
So-Cal Approach, this is La Vida
12-24. We have a possible terrorist threat.

235
00:17:12,696 --> 00:17:14,665
Possible?

236
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:16,200
We're below 2.500 feet.

237
00:17:16,232 --> 00:17:17,969
Requesting clearance
to go around.

238
00:17:18,001 --> 00:17:20,337
La Vida 12-24, please elaborate.

239
00:17:20,371 --> 00:17:25,243
A flight attendant received a recording outlining
a detailed threat if we attempt to land.

240
00:17:25,276 --> 00:17:27,345
Who gave the flight attendant
this recording?

241
00:17:27,377 --> 00:17:29,681
We're 2,000 feet! Do something.

242
00:17:29,713 --> 00:17:31,316
- Captain?
- Alexis, who gave it to you?

243
00:17:31,348 --> 00:17:36,153
It was in the cart. Anyone could
have put it there. 1,800 feet!

244
00:17:36,186 --> 00:17:38,288
So-Cal Approach, we once again
request permission-

245
00:17:38,321 --> 00:17:41,592
By the time they give us
permission we could all be dead.

246
00:17:43,661 --> 00:17:45,663
JC, what the hell are you doing?

247
00:18:00,076 --> 00:18:03,146
La Vida 12-24, you do not
have clear airspace.

248
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:06,284
Traffic - two contacts. One in your
three o'clock ascending into your path.

249
00:18:06,317 --> 00:18:09,954
The other in your five. Maintain
your current altitude.

250
00:18:10,954 --> 00:18:12,624
Prepare for collision.

251
00:18:12,656 --> 00:18:13,991
Oh my God! We're going to hit.

252
00:18:14,025 --> 00:18:16,928
Alexis, get out of here and get
yourself strapped down.

253
00:18:17,327 --> 00:18:20,764
La Vida 12-24, what are your
intentions, over?

254
00:18:22,199 --> 00:18:24,134
Do it now.

255
00:18:50,126 --> 00:18:52,363
- Sir, sit down!
- Hey!

256
00:18:52,395 --> 00:18:56,901
Alert! We have a runaway aircraft
and a possible terrorist situation.

257
00:18:56,933 --> 00:19:01,105
La Vida 12-24, make two-eighty heading
one-ninety and enter the transponder code

258
00:19:01,137 --> 00:19:04,875
for your situation if you
are unable to speak.

259
00:19:13,284 --> 00:19:14,986
Hey!

260
00:19:19,155 --> 00:19:23,461
Everyone. Everyone take your brace
position. Heads down or heads forward.

261
00:19:23,493 --> 00:19:26,063
Heads down or heads forward.

262
00:19:26,797 --> 00:19:28,732
Get everybody away from...

263
00:19:30,433 --> 00:19:33,038
Fly the plane.
Standard recovery.

264
00:19:33,237 --> 00:19:34,973
Preventing yaw nose down.

265
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,877
Keep the nose down. Stabilize.

266
00:19:51,788 --> 00:19:53,124
Come on.

267
00:19:56,527 --> 00:19:58,763
Captain, we're almost at
1,500 feet.

268
00:19:58,796 --> 00:20:01,932
That's the threshold the
terrorist warned us not to cross.

269
00:20:15,412 --> 00:20:17,981
We stayed above the threshold.

270
00:20:19,415 --> 00:20:21,885
Good thing I was
able to lift us up on time.

271
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,855
Now we got some time to figure
out what this thing really is.

272
00:20:24,888 --> 00:20:27,390
Captain, why do you still
look so tense?

273
00:20:35,566 --> 00:20:37,469
That's why.

274
00:20:38,935 --> 00:20:40,771
We're losing systems
left and right.

275
00:20:42,071 --> 00:20:43,907
La Vida 12-24, come in.

276
00:20:44,307 --> 00:20:48,413
- La Vida 12-24...
- La Vida 12-24, we've veered 1,200.

277
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:52,850
La Vida 12-24,
not seeing your transponder.

278
00:20:52,883 --> 00:20:55,819
Please go to one-two-one
point five.

279
00:20:55,853 --> 00:20:58,189
<i>One-two-one point five,
roger.</i>

280
00:20:58,388 --> 00:21:02,225
So-Cal, La Vida 12-24 on
one-two-one point five.

281
00:21:02,259 --> 00:21:05,529
<i>La Vida 12-24,
what's your current position?</i>

282
00:21:07,064 --> 00:21:09,567
So-Cal Approach, this is
La Vida 12-24.

283
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:13,103
All navigation and avionics have
failed except the com.

284
00:21:13,136 --> 00:21:15,239
We don't know exactly
where we are.

285
00:21:15,271 --> 00:21:18,876
But we have reason to believe
that the terrorist threat is real.

286
00:21:33,857 --> 00:21:36,360
Have you made your
decision yet, Benjy?

287
00:21:40,029 --> 00:21:41,465
Alright.

288
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:43,434
Wait!

289
00:21:45,301 --> 00:21:46,870
Okay. I'll do it.

290
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:48,572
I'm in.

291
00:21:50,207 --> 00:21:52,110
You got me.

292
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:09,227
I've finished my initial
interrogation, sir.

293
00:22:09,259 --> 00:22:11,162
And in conclusion?

294
00:22:11,194 --> 00:22:14,832
- Undecided.
- Undecided. Really?

295
00:22:15,566 --> 00:22:19,237
Do you still think that
he's a threat to national security?

296
00:22:19,269 --> 00:22:21,038
The boy's name is John Rogers,

297
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:24,942
who's on the no-fly list and
he's wanted in seven states.

298
00:22:28,244 --> 00:22:31,582
And what is John Rogers
wanted for?

299
00:22:32,182 --> 00:22:37,622
Armed robbery, physical
assault, arson, and kidnapping.

300
00:22:37,654 --> 00:22:41,893
And you think little Johnny
here is responsible for all that?

301
00:22:41,925 --> 00:22:44,561
Well, his name is on the list.

302
00:22:46,262 --> 00:22:47,898
May I?

303
00:22:49,098 --> 00:22:51,499
Ah.

304
00:22:50,534 --> 00:22:52,937
It is indeed.

305
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:55,472
I think we can probably
release him.

306
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:59,210
Thank you, officer.
Thank you very much.

307
00:23:05,615 --> 00:23:08,519
Well, come with me,
please.

308
00:23:16,292 --> 00:23:18,662
This is why no one trusts
us anymore.

309
00:23:18,695 --> 00:23:20,197
Yes, sir.

310
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:24,535
Wasting my time and yours confiscating
extra large tubes of toothpaste and

311
00:23:24,567 --> 00:23:27,070
interrogating women
breastfeeding their babies.

312
00:23:27,104 --> 00:23:29,507
Meanwhile, those who may
actually do us harm

313
00:23:29,539 --> 00:23:31,975
are invited to our planes
with open arms.

314
00:23:33,143 --> 00:23:35,947
- I give up.
- Yes, sir.

315
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:42,019
I mean, no, sir.
Obviously, don't.

316
00:23:42,752 --> 00:23:44,355
Please.

317
00:23:44,387 --> 00:23:46,656
- Agent Coleman?
- Who's asking?

318
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:50,128
My name is Belflor, sir. You're
needed in the traffic control.

319
00:23:51,194 --> 00:23:54,030
What for? Two kids kissing on
the tarmac again?

320
00:23:54,064 --> 00:23:56,601
We have a Rogue Baron.
In the red.

321
00:23:59,435 --> 00:24:00,437
Let's go.

322
00:24:03,374 --> 00:24:06,143
ATC is now under the authority
of Homeland Security.

323
00:24:06,175 --> 00:24:08,044
Ground all outbound flights.

324
00:24:08,077 --> 00:24:11,715
Divert incoming traffic to
Las Vegas and San Diego.

325
00:24:12,383 --> 00:24:15,318
Los Angeles is now under
a red terror alert.

326
00:24:15,352 --> 00:24:17,355
Santa Monica and Catalina
airports are calling in

327
00:24:17,387 --> 00:24:19,255
the smaller planes
currently in the air,

328
00:24:19,288 --> 00:24:23,193
but many are still out there.
It will take time.

329
00:24:23,227 --> 00:24:26,430
Lots of recreational pilots in
the sky. It's Sunday, after all.

330
00:24:26,462 --> 00:24:30,201
I don't care if it's Christmas and Santa's
test driving new reindeer. Bring them in.

331
00:24:30,233 --> 00:24:32,702
- Will do.
- Does El Segundo have a bird?

332
00:24:32,736 --> 00:24:35,639
Negative. The nearest F-18
is in San Diego.

333
00:24:35,672 --> 00:24:38,075
But they're prepping for launch
and they should be within

334
00:24:38,107 --> 00:24:40,144
Los Angeles air space
in twenty minutes.

335
00:24:40,176 --> 00:24:43,446
We'll blow that plane out of the
sky before I let it crash into the

336
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,517
Federal Building or whatever
they have planned.

337
00:24:46,549 --> 00:24:50,053
This is not going to be the West
Coast's version of 9/11.

338
00:24:50,086 --> 00:24:52,455
The captain said they received a
terrorist threat onboard

339
00:24:52,489 --> 00:24:55,326
the aircraft from a
recording device.

340
00:24:55,358 --> 00:25:00,096
Michaels, has the airport or any
other plane received a similar threat?

341
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:02,500
There has been no reported activity
on any terrorist watch lists.

342
00:25:02,532 --> 00:25:06,736
Who told you that, TSA? Those guys
have less sense than God gave Iraq.

343
00:25:06,769 --> 00:25:08,806
I printed out the plane's
manifest.

344
00:25:08,838 --> 00:25:12,342
There's 67 passengers, 2 pilots,
and 3 crew members.

345
00:25:12,375 --> 00:25:16,114
Ouch. Times are no bueno for
La Vida Airlines.

346
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,482
- I need a complete background check on every soul on board.
- Yes, sir.

347
00:25:19,516 --> 00:25:21,118
Can I speak to the Captain?

348
00:25:21,151 --> 00:25:23,187
He's on radio now.

349
00:25:24,654 --> 00:25:25,655
What's his name?

350
00:25:25,689 --> 00:25:28,493
Khalib Safir.

351
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:31,128
(QUIETLY)
He's Middle Eastern.

352
00:25:31,161 --> 00:25:32,430
Really? so am I.

353
00:25:32,462 --> 00:25:33,463
You are?

354
00:25:33,497 --> 00:25:34,532
No.

355
00:25:35,465 --> 00:25:38,269
But if I was, would you
trust me any less?

356
00:25:38,301 --> 00:25:39,603
No, sir.

357
00:25:40,403 --> 00:25:42,073
Thank you.

358
00:25:43,673 --> 00:25:46,676
La Vida 12-24.
Captain Safir,

359
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:49,380
this is Agent Coleman with
Homeland Security.

360
00:25:49,413 --> 00:25:53,116
I hear you're having quite
the Sunday drive up there today.

361
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:57,688
I'd take a cruise in my '65
Corvette any day over this.

362
00:25:57,721 --> 00:26:00,090
As soon as we get you home,

363
00:26:00,124 --> 00:26:02,226
I'll let you take me for a spin.

364
00:26:02,259 --> 00:26:03,627
Deal.

365
00:26:05,395 --> 00:26:08,865
<i>La Vida 12-24, we are clearing
the air space from Santa Monica to Malibu.</i>

366
00:26:08,898 --> 00:26:11,267
<i>What's your current altitude?</i>

367
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:14,438
So-Cal Approach, we are flying
a steady 1,000 feet.

368
00:26:15,638 --> 00:26:18,808
<i>Get down some more.
There are some cumulous clouds coming in.</i>

369
00:26:18,842 --> 00:26:23,114
<i>Those combined with the Santa Ana winds
are gonna get too much for you up there.</i>

370
00:26:23,146 --> 00:26:26,549
- Copy that. Lowering altitude.
- That's not a good idea.

371
00:26:26,583 --> 00:26:28,252
We can handle the air.

372
00:26:28,285 --> 00:26:32,690
So-Cal Approach, per your instruction, we
are descending down to a steady 750 feet.

373
00:26:32,722 --> 00:26:35,558
- <i>Copy that.</i>
- But... Captain?

374
00:26:35,592 --> 00:26:38,295
If we were in different seats,
you would make the call.

375
00:26:38,327 --> 00:26:40,163
But you're not.

376
00:26:40,196 --> 00:26:42,565
Even if I know what
you're doing is wrong?

377
00:26:42,598 --> 00:26:44,567
I'm just as capable as you.

378
00:26:44,601 --> 00:26:46,838
JC. This is my plane.

379
00:26:47,637 --> 00:26:50,240
Right.
Your plane.

380
00:26:51,607 --> 00:26:55,178
<i>Just stay above 500
feet in case the threat is real.</i>

381
00:26:55,511 --> 00:26:59,215
In case? Someone's managing to
jam our radar going in and out,

382
00:26:59,249 --> 00:27:00,784
you still think
this threat isn't real?

383
00:27:00,817 --> 00:27:03,520
Approach is just doing
their job, boys.

384
00:27:04,453 --> 00:27:05,855
Can you play me that recording?

385
00:27:05,888 --> 00:27:08,758
We need to record it for analysis
so we know what we're dealing with.

386
00:27:08,791 --> 00:27:11,294
Will do. You're sure the air
ahead is clear?

387
00:27:11,327 --> 00:27:15,365
Just stay along the beach. Don't head
out more than a mile towards the ocean.

388
00:27:15,398 --> 00:27:20,437
There's some bad wind shear coming off of the
Pacific that you can't fly above right now.

389
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:22,839
We can't track anything.

390
00:27:43,894 --> 00:27:44,795
Did we hit something?

391
00:27:44,828 --> 00:27:46,730
We're okay. Just some
major turbulence.

392
00:27:46,762 --> 00:27:48,665
- Why haven't we landed?
- We will.

393
00:27:48,699 --> 00:27:50,768
You keep saying that but it
never happens.

394
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,502
Matthew!

395
00:27:52,536 --> 00:27:54,272
No, no, no.
Oh my God. Oh my God.

396
00:27:54,538 --> 00:27:55,806
Tilt his head up.

397
00:27:57,406 --> 00:27:59,909
Oh my God. No, no,
no, no, no, no.

398
00:27:59,942 --> 00:28:02,779
- What happened?
- You hit your head. You may have a concussion.

399
00:28:02,813 --> 00:28:04,949
Is there a first aid kit and
some towels to wipe up the blood?

400
00:28:04,981 --> 00:28:06,216
Yeah.

401
00:28:06,583 --> 00:28:07,451
Are we on the ground?

402
00:28:07,483 --> 00:28:09,352
No. No. No,
we haven't landed.

403
00:28:09,385 --> 00:28:11,788
- My God. Why didn't I stay in Brazil?
- Here.

404
00:28:11,821 --> 00:28:13,390
Frankie!

405
00:28:13,789 --> 00:28:15,259
Help!

406
00:28:15,291 --> 00:28:16,593
Hold this.

407
00:28:17,795 --> 00:28:19,163
Careful. Careful. Careful.

408
00:28:19,195 --> 00:28:23,400
- Careful. Careful. His ribs maybe broken.
- Alexis, help me!

409
00:28:33,509 --> 00:28:35,011
Set him down!

410
00:28:35,045 --> 00:28:37,480
We have to make sure he's as
comfortable as possible.

411
00:28:37,513 --> 00:28:39,382
Okay. Over there!

412
00:28:39,415 --> 00:28:40,850
No, he's going to roll off.

413
00:28:40,884 --> 00:28:42,620
There's empty room in coach.

414
00:28:42,653 --> 00:28:44,288
- Okay. I'm going to help you, ready?
- Yeah.

415
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,224
One. Two. Three.

416
00:28:50,059 --> 00:28:53,230
Right here. It's going
to be okay. Okay?

417
00:28:53,497 --> 00:28:55,432
Just hang on there.

418
00:29:00,037 --> 00:29:01,905
Captain. Straight ahead.

419
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,275
Which way do we turn?

420
00:29:05,308 --> 00:29:08,345
So-Cal Approach, I thought you
said this airspace was clear.

421
00:29:08,377 --> 00:29:11,615
It is. What
do you see?

422
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:26,562
If they crash, there will be
less civilian casualties.

423
00:29:26,596 --> 00:29:28,131
Except the lives on board.

424
00:29:28,163 --> 00:29:32,769
A plane that size can't sustain airspeed
at that low altitude over the ocean.

425
00:29:32,803 --> 00:29:37,775
If they fly against the heavy Pacific wind
currents, they hit too much shear. See?

426
00:29:38,575 --> 00:29:41,412
I recommend that they stay over
the land if you want to keep them

427
00:29:41,444 --> 00:29:44,682
at an altitude between
500 to 1,500 feet.

428
00:29:44,714 --> 00:29:46,750
Is that really worth the risk?

429
00:29:46,782 --> 00:29:49,352
To the people on that
plane it is.

430
00:29:49,385 --> 00:29:52,822
Until otherwise, we're doing
everything we can to keep them alive.

431
00:29:52,855 --> 00:29:55,393
- Coleman, if that plane...
- Michales.

432
00:29:57,993 --> 00:30:01,898
Right now you're being as useful
as a pogo stick in quick sand.

433
00:30:01,932 --> 00:30:04,000
I need you to be a knight,
not a ninny.

434
00:30:04,567 --> 00:30:07,837
- Now help me find out what we're up against.
- Yes, sir.

435
00:30:07,871 --> 00:30:11,909
La Vida 12-24, head
east at 120 degrees.

436
00:30:11,942 --> 00:30:14,845
<i>So-Cal, this is La Vida
12-24. On course now.</i>

437
00:30:20,784 --> 00:30:22,386
We need some help up in here!

438
00:30:22,419 --> 00:30:26,090
Ladies and gentlemen, is there
anyone on board with medical training?

439
00:30:26,123 --> 00:30:28,859
I can help with the basics.
I used to be an EMT.

440
00:30:28,892 --> 00:30:31,595
Thank God. In my book that
qualifies you to do heart surgery.

441
00:30:31,627 --> 00:30:34,898
- We need ice packs for him and the others.
- Okay.

442
00:30:37,634 --> 00:30:39,769
- I got these.
- Thanks. Let me know if I can help in anyway.

443
00:30:39,803 --> 00:30:41,472
Okay.

444
00:30:42,838 --> 00:30:43,940
Hold on to this right here.

445
00:30:43,973 --> 00:30:46,609
I don't think it's broken.
Just tilt your head back.

446
00:30:46,643 --> 00:30:50,413
Then why does it feel like my face
is my balls and I just got kicked.

447
00:30:50,446 --> 00:30:52,415
You're still bleeding a lot.
That's why.

448
00:30:52,449 --> 00:30:57,721
Everyone, if you or someone beside you
is injured, please raise your hand.

449
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:02,793
Dammit, Khalib, I told you not
to fly at such a low altitude.

450
00:31:02,826 --> 00:31:04,495
This discussion can wait.

451
00:31:04,528 --> 00:31:09,400
Yeah, if we had discussed this in the first
place, we wouldn't--JC. You're not helping.

452
00:31:09,699 --> 00:31:12,702
This plane would have crashed if
you didn't have my help.

453
00:31:15,872 --> 00:31:18,709
Flight crew, I need an attendant
to report to the deck immediately.

454
00:31:18,741 --> 00:31:20,543
What's wrong?

455
00:31:20,977 --> 00:31:22,579
I'm going to help you calm down.

456
00:31:22,612 --> 00:31:24,114
I don't need to calm down.

457
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:27,918
Come in.

458
00:31:32,588 --> 00:31:34,625
- Yes, captain.
- Sit in the cockpit while

459
00:31:34,657 --> 00:31:36,993
- JC steps out for a moment.
- I'm not stepping out.

460
00:31:37,027 --> 00:31:39,962
- Step outside and drink some water.
- I'm not thirsty.

461
00:31:39,996 --> 00:31:44,168
I need you to lower your level of stress.
You're no good to me angry.

462
00:31:44,201 --> 00:31:46,636
You think this is angry?

463
00:31:47,037 --> 00:31:51,442
Step outside and
cool down. Now.

464
00:32:27,243 --> 00:32:29,078
Ladies and gentlemen, we are
experiencing technical

465
00:32:29,112 --> 00:32:31,915
difficulties which are currently
being remedied.

466
00:32:31,948 --> 00:32:36,053
I hope to have further updates
and information for you soon.

467
00:32:36,086 --> 00:32:38,221
In the meantime, please
cooperate with the flight crew

468
00:32:38,255 --> 00:32:40,824
and remain seated while we
handle the situation.

469
00:32:40,856 --> 00:32:42,593
Thank you.

470
00:33:19,229 --> 00:33:21,565
Wait. You're coming with me?

471
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,636
How am I supposed to get
you past security?

472
00:33:30,272 --> 00:33:33,843
Yeah. I guess I can
sneak you in.

473
00:33:34,144 --> 00:33:35,913
I don't sneak.

474
00:33:41,017 --> 00:33:44,221
Hey Benjy. You forget
it's Sunday?

475
00:33:44,253 --> 00:33:48,324
You know me. Just-
Work. Work. Work.

476
00:33:48,357 --> 00:33:52,162
If only you'd been this dedicated
to your studies back at A&M.

477
00:33:52,194 --> 00:33:54,196
I taught Benjy his first coding
course in college.

478
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:56,799
He'll never forgiven me for
giving him a B.

479
00:33:56,833 --> 00:33:58,669
You teach at Texas A&M?

480
00:33:58,701 --> 00:34:02,972
Benjy's one of our most
successful graduates.

481
00:34:04,074 --> 00:34:09,846
Good thing you got that academics down.
'Cause UCLA is whipping your butt right now.

482
00:34:09,878 --> 00:34:15,351
Careful. Those are fighting
words. And I've got claws.

483
00:34:15,385 --> 00:34:21,325
What kind of ID would you like to see?
Driver's license, passport, Texas alumni card?

484
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:23,594
Driver's license, please.

485
00:34:23,793 --> 00:34:26,630
Keep that A&M card away from me.

486
00:34:27,329 --> 00:34:29,266
Not a Texas fan?

487
00:34:30,699 --> 00:34:33,036
Not until you walked
in the door.

488
00:34:39,041 --> 00:34:40,643
Okay, then.

489
00:34:41,777 --> 00:34:44,614
Andy, thank you so much.

490
00:34:44,648 --> 00:34:50,387
And we're just gonna be up in my
office, in case anything comes up.

491
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:52,822
Yeah. Sure.

492
00:34:53,722 --> 00:34:55,726
Goodbye.

493
00:35:31,293 --> 00:35:35,965
<i>So-Cal to La
Vida 12-24. What is your position?</i>

494
00:35:37,032 --> 00:35:39,302
- May I respond?
- Please.

495
00:35:41,036 --> 00:35:45,408
So-Cal, This is La Vida 12-24.
We're at an altitude of 900 feet.

496
00:35:45,442 --> 00:35:48,177
We're coming up on
Pasadena at 240 degrees.

497
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:51,781
La Vida 12-24 stay on course and
wait for our direction.

498
00:35:51,815 --> 00:35:53,817
We're going to turn you
back out to LAX.

499
00:35:53,849 --> 00:35:57,319
You better have good words and not bad
breath in that mouth of yours, Michaels.

500
00:35:57,353 --> 00:36:00,057
We got two verifiable hits on
the maintenance crew in Brazil.

501
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:02,225
Do you know what type of device
they put on the plane?

502
00:36:02,257 --> 00:36:05,027
Well, right now we're working
with Sao Paulo authorities to get

503
00:36:05,061 --> 00:36:08,332
- them in for questioning.
- I need to know what's on that plane now.

504
00:36:10,266 --> 00:36:11,835
Are they still in a
secure pattern?

505
00:36:11,867 --> 00:36:14,170
Taking it minute by
minute by minute.

506
00:36:14,204 --> 00:36:19,242
We need to stop their roller coaster ride
long enough for the crew to search the plane.

507
00:36:19,275 --> 00:36:22,179
Any luck with the recordings?

508
00:36:22,211 --> 00:36:26,282
The feds say it could take weeks
to analyze and track the source.

509
00:36:28,117 --> 00:36:31,253
If that device doesn't kill
them, an empty gas tank will.

510
00:36:31,286 --> 00:36:32,788
How many kilos they got left?

511
00:36:32,822 --> 00:36:35,192
Enough to keep them going
another fifty minutes.

512
00:36:35,224 --> 00:36:36,159
Maybe.

513
00:36:36,193 --> 00:36:39,129
But if they fly too low, they'll
burn right...

514
00:36:39,161 --> 00:36:39,962
Screw me.

515
00:36:39,996 --> 00:36:42,365
- What is it?
- How did I miss this?

516
00:36:42,398 --> 00:36:44,835
- More aircrafts?
- La Vida 12-24, this is So-Cal.

517
00:36:44,867 --> 00:36:46,903
Immediate twenty degrees south.

518
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,911
Away from the hills. I want as
much unblocked air as possible.

519
00:36:56,179 --> 00:36:58,315
Flight team, prepare for
turbulence.

520
00:36:58,947 --> 00:37:00,382
Strap in. We're in for
some chop.

521
00:37:00,416 --> 00:37:03,153
Wouldn't it be better just to
take our chances and jump?

522
00:37:03,186 --> 00:37:05,756
Quick. Quick.
Get to your seat now.

523
00:37:10,425 --> 00:37:11,527
You're good.

524
00:37:11,561 --> 00:37:13,963
You actually care.

525
00:37:13,996 --> 00:37:16,799
I'm just doing what anybody
else would do.

526
00:37:16,833 --> 00:37:18,969
Not anybody.

527
00:37:20,503 --> 00:37:22,472
This wind is working against us.

528
00:37:22,505 --> 00:37:24,474
- More power?
- Yeah.

529
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:32,248
Wait, that's too much.

530
00:37:42,157 --> 00:37:44,961
Jesus, what's going on
out there?

531
00:37:46,862 --> 00:37:49,065
Who's broadcasting that
aerial shot?

532
00:37:49,364 --> 00:37:51,300
Is that coming from a
news chopper?

533
00:37:51,333 --> 00:37:53,036
Didn't we issue a no-fly zone?

534
00:37:53,068 --> 00:37:56,405
We did. All news stations
agreed to it.

535
00:37:56,438 --> 00:37:59,308
Well somebody lied.

536
00:38:07,416 --> 00:38:09,219
Jesus.

537
00:38:24,132 --> 00:38:26,101
Power to the left.
Just a touch.

538
00:38:26,135 --> 00:38:28,271
- Increasing the left engine to
stabilize. - We're either going

539
00:38:28,304 --> 00:38:38,315
to fly into the city or this baby's
gonna drop. On my count. One, two, three!

540
00:38:38,347 --> 00:38:47,056
to fly into the city or this baby's
gonna drop. On my count. One, two, three!

541
00:38:54,898 --> 00:38:56,499
Let's get some altitude.

542
00:38:56,532 --> 00:38:58,268
Keep it controlled.

543
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:01,003
Turbulence around these
buildings is absurd.

544
00:39:18,521 --> 00:39:19,055
My bag!

545
00:39:19,088 --> 00:39:21,291
Leave it, Kurt!

546
00:39:21,925 --> 00:39:24,094
- Leave it!
- Souvenirs.

547
00:39:31,233 --> 00:39:34,371
La Vida 12-24. Now stable at
one thousand.

548
00:39:34,403 --> 00:39:36,974
Men, you're doing a hell of
a job up there.

549
00:39:38,007 --> 00:39:40,476
- Much better job than what we're doing for them down here.
- Sir. We're dealing with

550
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:43,947
a terrorist who hasn't told us who they
are, what they want, or how we'll even

551
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:46,548
know if they finally get it. Alright.
This is far from textbook.

552
00:39:46,581 --> 00:39:50,386
If we are going to win this game we
need to find out what all the pieces are.

553
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:58,028
Captain, I need you to find out what's
been on that plane so we can get rid of it.

554
00:39:59,195 --> 00:40:00,697
Come in.

555
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:03,967
Captain, it's getting messy out there.
Everyone keeps asking questions.

556
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,668
I don't know what to tell them.

557
00:40:05,702 --> 00:40:09,039
Tell them what they need to know.
That a mechanical failure is...

558
00:40:09,072 --> 00:40:10,673
That's a lie.

559
00:40:11,474 --> 00:40:14,411
It's a lie but it will keep them
calm and in their seats.

560
00:40:15,077 --> 00:40:16,413
You need to take mine.

561
00:40:16,445 --> 00:40:17,713
What?

562
00:40:17,746 --> 00:40:18,714
Where are you going?

563
00:40:18,748 --> 00:40:21,985
Find out what this lunatic
put on the plane.

564
00:40:23,052 --> 00:40:24,320
JC, you're in charge.

565
00:40:24,353 --> 00:40:26,255
No, captain-

566
00:40:26,456 --> 00:40:29,960
I don't think-You should
stay and I'll go, okay?

567
00:40:30,193 --> 00:40:32,028
This is my plane.

568
00:40:32,061 --> 00:40:34,431
I gotta find out what's
going on with it.

569
00:40:35,097 --> 00:40:36,365
Okay. Then I'll come with you.

570
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,735
You know it's regulation to always
have two crew members in pit.

571
00:40:39,768 --> 00:40:41,737
But captain, I don't think
that's a good idea.

572
00:40:41,771 --> 00:40:44,274
Alexis, you heard the captain.

573
00:40:44,306 --> 00:40:46,375
Respect his wishes.

574
00:40:55,318 --> 00:40:56,553
Ladies and gentlemen,

575
00:40:56,585 --> 00:40:59,555
I thank you for your cooperation
with the crew as we deal with

576
00:40:59,588 --> 00:41:03,360
this unexpected minor
mechanical issue.

577
00:41:03,393 --> 00:41:05,394
Mechanical issue?

578
00:41:05,728 --> 00:41:07,530
I promise
we will resolve the issue

579
00:41:07,563 --> 00:41:09,766
as soon as we can. And you
have my guarantee that

580
00:41:09,798 --> 00:41:13,702
the crew and I will do everything we
can to get you on the ground safely.

581
00:41:13,735 --> 00:41:18,074
And while we fix this issue,
please remain seated silently.

582
00:41:18,106 --> 00:41:24,146
And request assistance from the crew only
when absolutely necessary. Thank you.

583
00:41:39,295 --> 00:41:41,530
Hey. Hey.
Excuse me?

584
00:41:41,563 --> 00:41:43,465
Excuse me? Do you
need some help?

585
00:41:43,498 --> 00:41:46,602
I worked the war in Iraq and was
on the bomb-disposal team.

586
00:41:46,635 --> 00:41:50,472
Before that I was a mechanic on
some B-52s in Louisiana.

587
00:41:50,505 --> 00:41:52,675
I'm good with planes.

588
00:41:53,076 --> 00:41:55,545
- Well this isn't a military plane.
- Right. Right. Right.

589
00:41:55,577 --> 00:41:59,416
But I may be able of some assistance.
You know? Just in case.

590
00:41:59,449 --> 00:42:03,686
I'd hate to think I could have
helped and I didn't.

591
00:42:03,719 --> 00:42:07,557
Okay. I'll consider it.
Thanks.

592
00:42:12,961 --> 00:42:16,365
What can I say, Nurse Nightingale?
You've inspired me to help my fellow man.

593
00:42:19,501 --> 00:42:22,572
I see some very
nice work here.

594
00:42:23,739 --> 00:42:27,344
And I see some very
sloppy work here.

595
00:42:27,543 --> 00:42:30,747
This isn't easy. Okay?

596
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:34,151
- The code is divided into three different quant...
- Shhh!

597
00:42:35,751 --> 00:42:39,356
You can transfer it onto this.

598
00:42:42,525 --> 00:42:44,227
What do you want this
code for anyway?

599
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:45,895
Not your concern.

600
00:42:45,929 --> 00:42:49,566
Well, since if the Genesis 7 gets in the
wrong hands it can literally end the world.

601
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:53,269
No matter. I'll still get my
100 million.

602
00:42:54,137 --> 00:42:56,639
This is about cash?

603
00:42:56,672 --> 00:42:59,675
You are doing all this
over some cash?

604
00:43:00,175 --> 00:43:04,847
It's shocking what people will do for even
one percent of the kind of stash I rank in.

605
00:43:09,184 --> 00:43:10,753
Oh. Benjly.

606
00:43:11,521 --> 00:43:13,556
Look, it's your wife.

607
00:43:13,588 --> 00:43:14,757
It's Donna?

608
00:43:14,789 --> 00:43:17,293
- Come on-
- Work.

609
00:43:18,161 --> 00:43:22,132
I'm okay. I'm not hurt.

610
00:43:22,164 --> 00:43:26,603
I shouldn't have left the
way I did. I'm sorry.

611
00:43:29,271 --> 00:43:31,340
Okay. Could I please
respond to her?

612
00:43:31,373 --> 00:43:33,475
Just give me the code and you
can do anything you want.

613
00:43:33,509 --> 00:43:36,880
Come on, you-God! At least give me
the chance to tell her that I love her.

614
00:43:36,913 --> 00:43:39,349
Benjy? Is that you?

615
00:43:43,853 --> 00:43:45,722
Amy?

616
00:43:54,864 --> 00:43:56,699
What's wrong?

617
00:44:01,704 --> 00:44:03,740
Cliff is dead.

618
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:07,244
And his family.

619
00:44:09,211 --> 00:44:11,280
Amy.

620
00:44:11,313 --> 00:44:13,248
Amy.

621
00:44:13,282 --> 00:44:15,285
How were they killed?

622
00:44:16,418 --> 00:44:21,290
They were on their way to Santa
Barbara when their boat exploded.

623
00:44:24,226 --> 00:44:27,396
- A bad fuel line or...
- Ooh.

624
00:44:28,331 --> 00:44:31,201
I'm so sorry for your loss.

625
00:44:31,833 --> 00:44:33,702
Who are you?

626
00:44:34,269 --> 00:44:35,371
I'm Donna's friend.

627
00:44:35,405 --> 00:44:38,575
Benjy and I were getting brunch
when he heard the news.

628
00:44:39,842 --> 00:44:43,512
He's just here downloading somethings
so that he can work remotely.

629
00:44:44,947 --> 00:44:48,251
What are you guys
downloading anyway?

630
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:51,188
It's actually just the
Mackenzie crap.

631
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:55,491
- That's not do for another month though.
- Yeah.

632
00:44:58,827 --> 00:45:01,431
Benjy, you work too much.

633
00:45:02,565 --> 00:45:03,865
Yeah.

634
00:45:03,898 --> 00:45:06,302
I realize that. Now.

635
00:45:07,335 --> 00:45:12,942
Well, you know, I just came to pick up
some of Cliff's things for his mom. So.

636
00:45:12,974 --> 00:45:16,679
- Hurry up and get out of here.
- Okay.

637
00:45:17,579 --> 00:45:19,415
You'll be alright.

638
00:45:24,387 --> 00:45:28,258
Yes. Benjy.
Hurry up.

639
00:45:29,525 --> 00:45:31,461
She seems like a nice girl.

640
00:45:31,494 --> 00:45:34,931
It's no wonder that she was on the
team also who created Genesis 7.

641
00:45:34,963 --> 00:45:37,333
Hmm.

642
00:45:37,565 --> 00:45:43,372
I wonder if she would be interested
in cooperating with me if you mess up.

643
00:45:55,717 --> 00:45:57,085
What's this for?

644
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:59,621
To keep me from getting fried when
handling the computer equipment.

645
00:45:59,655 --> 00:46:02,525
I don't know what they may have
done down there.

646
00:46:08,697 --> 00:46:10,866
Make sure this stays grounded.

647
00:46:45,534 --> 00:46:48,438
So did you find out
what's malfunctioning?

648
00:46:48,471 --> 00:46:50,340
It'll be okay.

649
00:46:58,748 --> 00:47:00,483
JC? Open the door.

650
00:47:02,885 --> 00:47:04,721
JC?

651
00:47:13,829 --> 00:47:15,431
Did you find anything?

652
00:47:15,463 --> 00:47:18,835
I took some pictures. Whatever is planted on there,

653
00:47:18,867 --> 00:47:22,338
looks like it's using the plane
to charge its own.

654
00:47:27,476 --> 00:47:29,846
JC? Open this door.

655
00:47:30,846 --> 00:47:32,681
Open the door.

656
00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:38,954
La Vida 12-24 this is Coleman.
Any luck with that jamming device?

657
00:47:38,987 --> 00:47:40,856
That's a negative.

658
00:47:42,625 --> 00:47:44,760
What did Captain Safir find?

659
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,864
Still searching the bay.

660
00:47:47,896 --> 00:47:50,432
He left me in charge of
the flight deck.

661
00:47:55,838 --> 00:47:57,940
JC, are you crazy?

662
00:47:57,972 --> 00:47:59,942
The only reason why you and
everyone else on this plane

663
00:47:59,974 --> 00:48:04,079
are still alive because of the
decisions I've made, not Khalib.

664
00:48:04,112 --> 00:48:06,648
If it weren't for my quick thinking,
he would have tried to land this plane.

665
00:48:06,681 --> 00:48:12,053
- He was just trying to do the right thing.
- But I did the right thing. Me.

666
00:48:12,086 --> 00:48:15,492
As long as he's not on this
cockpit, I'm in charge.

667
00:48:19,527 --> 00:48:22,764
Just those gnarly Santa Ana
winds acting up.

668
00:48:22,797 --> 00:48:24,833
Dropping down a bit should
take care of it.

669
00:48:27,469 --> 00:48:28,203
See?

670
00:48:28,237 --> 00:48:30,606
Things are better already.

671
00:48:35,643 --> 00:48:37,546
Why don't they just land?

672
00:48:40,682 --> 00:48:41,985
Hey.

673
00:48:43,219 --> 00:48:45,722
Why don't you tell us what's
really wrong or land the plane?

674
00:48:47,088 --> 00:48:49,192
- What's the pro...
- Sir. Please go back to your seat.

675
00:48:49,224 --> 00:48:50,492
Uh-oh.

676
00:48:51,494 --> 00:48:52,461
The rats are about to
overtake the kitchen.

677
00:48:52,494 --> 00:48:53,661
I want to know why the
captain is locked out of

678
00:48:53,695 --> 00:48:56,865
- his own flight deck.
- Sir, this is official business.

679
00:48:56,898 --> 00:48:59,634
- Please have...
- Don't. Don't bully me, buddy.

680
00:48:59,668 --> 00:49:02,704
- I'm not bullying anyone.
- My wife's hurt.

681
00:49:02,737 --> 00:49:06,509
And this plane has destroyed city
property and everyone's scared as hell.

682
00:49:06,541 --> 00:49:09,679
- Like the captain has said, it is a mechanical issue.
- Bull.

683
00:49:10,211 --> 00:49:11,681
I have a right to know.

684
00:49:11,713 --> 00:49:14,650
Sir, please.
Go back to your seat.

685
00:49:19,889 --> 00:49:23,259
Unless you want to explain to your beer-bellied
friends why a flight attendant from

686
00:49:23,291 --> 00:49:27,496
West Hollywood broke your arm, I suggest
you go back to your seat and not hit me.

687
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:29,999
Now sir, please have a seat

688
00:49:30,032 --> 00:49:32,268
and let the captain continue
his explanation.

689
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:34,837
I won't have violence
on my flight.

690
00:49:37,206 --> 00:49:39,943
Just got a little congested.
That's all.

691
00:49:40,175 --> 00:49:42,010
I won't hurt anyone.

692
00:49:42,610 --> 00:49:43,511
Good.

693
00:49:43,545 --> 00:49:46,048
Because we're in enough
trouble as it is.

694
00:49:46,882 --> 00:49:50,786
You all deserve to know we
received a terrorist threat.

695
00:49:50,818 --> 00:49:52,922
This plane will crash if
we try to land.

696
00:49:52,954 --> 00:49:55,123
And why aren't you
flying the plane?

697
00:49:55,157 --> 00:49:58,693
The terrorist is in there, isn't he?
He's one of the pilots.

698
00:49:58,726 --> 00:50:01,263
My copilot and I just had a
misunderstanding, that is all.

699
00:50:01,297 --> 00:50:03,532
What, he locked you out
of the cockpit?

700
00:50:04,166 --> 00:50:06,269
What did you do to the
bottom of the plane?

701
00:50:06,302 --> 00:50:08,170
I saw him go down there.

702
00:50:08,202 --> 00:50:09,403
I saw him.

703
00:50:09,438 --> 00:50:12,675
I have a feeling I know who the
terrorist on this plane is.

704
00:50:12,708 --> 00:50:15,545
It isn't the first time someone
like you has put a flight at risk.

705
00:50:15,577 --> 00:50:18,313
- Someone like me?
- Yeah, someone like you.

706
00:50:18,347 --> 00:50:20,716
I knew as soon as I got on
board this plane and saw

707
00:50:20,748 --> 00:50:22,985
what you looked like, this
flight was in trouble.

708
00:50:23,318 --> 00:50:25,654
- This is getting out of control.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

709
00:50:25,688 --> 00:50:28,724
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to go do something. - KURT: Up there?

710
00:50:28,757 --> 00:50:31,961
- Yeah. I'm going to take my chances.
- You'll just make it worse.

711
00:50:32,193 --> 00:50:35,197
I'm American. Just like you.

712
00:50:35,664 --> 00:50:38,234
Nah, man.
You ain't nothing like me.

713
00:50:38,266 --> 00:50:40,335
- You ain't nothing...
- Hey Texas!

714
00:50:40,369 --> 00:50:41,570
Knock it off.

715
00:50:41,603 --> 00:50:43,972
You want to hit him, you're
going to have to hit me first.

716
00:50:44,005 --> 00:50:49,010
- You're protecting him?
- I'm protecting all of us. Now sit down,

717
00:50:49,043 --> 00:50:52,280
put your seat belt on, and
listen to our Captain.

718
00:50:52,313 --> 00:50:54,917
- But-
- SHUT UP!

719
00:51:10,965 --> 00:51:13,268
Everyone into your seats.
Now!

720
00:51:23,878 --> 00:51:26,815
Just a little navigation error.

721
00:51:27,349 --> 00:51:31,287
Diverting power from the main generator to
the battery to get the elevator back online.

722
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:34,757
- The captain should be in here.
- Hey. Hey.

723
00:51:34,989 --> 00:51:39,160
You may be willing to put your
life in his hands, but I'm not.

724
00:51:39,193 --> 00:51:41,730
You can't fly this alone.

725
00:51:41,764 --> 00:51:47,036
I've got this. Alright. I've just got to lean
into the pivot to correct it like I did before.

726
00:51:49,170 --> 00:51:50,306
Sir.

727
00:51:51,539 --> 00:51:52,807
We have visual of the 757
heading into the Hollywood Hills.

728
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:56,011
- We are in position to shoot down the wing...
- Jesus Christ,

729
00:51:56,045 --> 00:51:58,280
What is happening on that plane?

730
00:51:59,882 --> 00:52:05,755
La Vida 12-24, this is Coleman.
You have ten seconds to redirect

731
00:52:05,788 --> 00:52:10,626
your flight pattern or we are
taking invasive action.

732
00:52:25,407 --> 00:52:27,809
We can correct it.
Turn 50 degrees to the left

733
00:52:27,842 --> 00:52:30,346
and increase the throttle
when I say mark. Ready?

734
00:52:30,378 --> 00:52:32,081
Uh. Yeah.

735
00:52:32,114 --> 00:52:34,349
Three. Two. One. Mark.

736
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:53,702
JC, we'll discuss what happened
when we are on the ground.

737
00:52:53,735 --> 00:52:56,838
And right now that's my number
one priority, getting home.

738
00:52:56,871 --> 00:52:57,772
But I need your
cooperation.

739
00:52:57,806 --> 00:53:00,676
No grudges.
No ulterior motive.

740
00:53:00,876 --> 00:53:02,945
Otherwise whoever is behind this
has already won,

741
00:53:02,978 --> 00:53:06,782
and these passengers will die
because you and I can't get along.

742
00:53:09,184 --> 00:53:10,920
Khalib, I-

743
00:53:13,322 --> 00:53:15,358
We'll discuss this when we land.

744
00:53:23,965 --> 00:53:28,704
Sir, this is now a domestic terrorist
attack on United States soil.

745
00:53:29,771 --> 00:53:33,275
The President has been informed and wants your
feedback whether or not to shoot it down.

746
00:53:33,307 --> 00:53:37,045
Now, I would be remiss if I didn't tell
you that our estimates calculate minimal

747
00:53:37,079 --> 00:53:40,149
civilian casualties if we
take action now.

748
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:44,086
Seventy two people.
That seems minimal.

749
00:53:44,952 --> 00:53:46,956
It may be our only option.

750
00:53:51,793 --> 00:53:53,261
Michaels.

751
00:53:53,295 --> 00:53:55,030
Yes, sir.

752
00:53:55,831 --> 00:53:58,401
How fast can you get me
on that plane?

753
00:54:23,090 --> 00:54:24,726
<i>I
mean, come on, really Kelly.</i>

754
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:29,131
<i>Do you even know what honest
hard working Americans are on board?</i>

755
00:54:29,164 --> 00:54:33,569
<i>I mean, sources insist this
isn't a hostage situation but a mechanical...</i>

756
00:54:33,601 --> 00:54:37,239
- Let me call her.
- <i>So this isn't a terrorist situation...</i>

757
00:54:37,271 --> 00:54:39,976
Come on. At
least let me text her back.

758
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:46,515
Listen.

759
00:54:46,547 --> 00:54:50,152
I can't have her think
that I don't care.

760
00:54:50,351 --> 00:54:53,021
Look. I need her to know that I
should have gone with her.

761
00:54:53,054 --> 00:54:55,290
And I know that now.

762
00:54:55,324 --> 00:54:57,827
<i>...to protect us, and our entire country</i>

763
00:54:57,860 --> 00:55:02,097
- <i>could be destroyed. I blame the President.</i>
- <i>Absolutely.</i>

764
00:55:02,130 --> 00:55:04,200
<i>It's always his fault.
I mean, not the one coming in.</i>

765
00:55:04,233 --> 00:55:06,435
<i>You remember
the plane that disappeared?</i>

766
00:55:06,467 --> 00:55:08,336
What are you doing?

767
00:55:09,538 --> 00:55:11,139
<i>They didn't have
enough peanuts.</i>

768
00:55:11,172 --> 00:55:15,543
<i>They didn't have enough
peanuts. Alright. Back to you guys.</i>

769
00:55:15,577 --> 00:55:18,080
I will enter through
the cargo hold.

770
00:55:19,014 --> 00:55:22,084
At your low altitude, there should
be no danger of pressurization loss.

771
00:55:22,117 --> 00:55:24,353
It will just be windy as hell.

772
00:55:24,385 --> 00:55:27,155
The doors will depart at the rate
of sixty knots on the ground.

773
00:55:27,188 --> 00:55:29,557
How many of you are
coming on board?

774
00:55:29,590 --> 00:55:33,328
<i>Two. Myself and
a specialists gonna try and rewire the</i>

775
00:55:33,362 --> 00:55:35,231
<i>circuitry to the stabilizer
system.</i>

776
00:55:35,264 --> 00:55:36,932
You know how to disable it?

777
00:55:36,965 --> 00:55:39,934
<i>My team analyzed the
photos captain Safir sent.</i>

778
00:55:39,967 --> 00:55:41,936
<i>I'm not gonna lie. This is
going to be trickier than</i>

779
00:55:41,969 --> 00:55:44,973
<i>trying to get a mule to
mate with a sheepdog.</i>

780
00:55:45,007 --> 00:55:46,909
When should we open the doors?

781
00:55:46,942 --> 00:55:49,210
<i>In two minutes our plane
should be aligned with yours.</i>

782
00:55:49,244 --> 00:55:52,047
<i>Open a hatch and we'll
zip line over.</i>

783
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:55,617
<i>You need to slow to a
speed of 150 to 175.</i>

784
00:55:57,018 --> 00:55:59,554
That's too low. We'll burn right
through our fuel reserves.

785
00:55:59,588 --> 00:56:02,524
Guys, we shouldn't be doing this.
The instructions were very clear-

786
00:56:02,556 --> 00:56:04,492
no outside interference.

787
00:56:04,525 --> 00:56:08,597
In about twenty minutes,
we'll have no more fuel and no plane.

788
00:56:09,331 --> 00:56:11,367
Okay. Fine. I'll go down
and guide them in.

789
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:15,304
- I'll be right behind you.
- With that eye? No way.

790
00:56:20,175 --> 00:56:21,677
Don't get too comfortable.

791
00:56:21,710 --> 00:56:23,346
I'll be right back.

792
00:56:24,146 --> 00:56:25,648
I can go by myself.

793
00:56:25,681 --> 00:56:28,217
I'd love to pin all of our hopes
and dreams on you,

794
00:56:28,250 --> 00:56:30,152
but I only have one pin left.

795
00:56:30,184 --> 00:56:32,288
I'm all out of dreams.

796
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:35,391
Are you guys sure there's not another way?
We are breaking the rules.

797
00:56:35,423 --> 00:56:38,393
Stop talking and start
walking.

798
00:56:40,628 --> 00:56:43,531
Just try to keep it steady
and don't dump me out.

799
00:56:44,498 --> 00:56:47,068
Although I wouldn't blame
you if you did.

800
00:56:52,074 --> 00:56:54,610
We're in position!
Open the doors!

801
00:56:56,545 --> 00:56:58,047
You got your seat belt on?

802
00:57:01,016 --> 00:57:01,383
Yeah.

803
00:57:01,416 --> 00:57:02,384
Tight?

804
00:57:02,416 --> 00:57:03,485
I think so.

805
00:57:03,518 --> 00:57:05,221
Make sure.

806
00:57:21,369 --> 00:57:22,136
PTSD?

807
00:57:22,170 --> 00:57:23,405
Huh?

808
00:57:23,438 --> 00:57:27,209
Post traumatic stress disorder.
You're showing the symptoms.

809
00:57:27,242 --> 00:57:30,144
- Is that obvious, huh?
- Do you have something you take for it?

810
00:57:30,177 --> 00:57:34,449
- Do you need me to get your bag?
- No. No no no no no no. Just-

811
00:57:35,784 --> 00:57:37,419
Just hold my hand.

812
00:57:37,452 --> 00:57:39,322
That works best.

813
00:58:02,443 --> 00:58:05,380
Do I have adequate
coverage to get a clean purchase?

814
00:58:05,579 --> 00:58:07,215
The wall is clear!

815
00:58:07,248 --> 00:58:11,319
Aim high so you
miss the baggage!

816
00:58:11,353 --> 00:58:13,688
Move over! Both of you!

817
00:58:25,367 --> 00:58:27,470
The hook is secure!

818
00:58:31,206 --> 00:58:33,108
Come on! Let me call Donna!

819
00:58:33,141 --> 00:58:36,012
You know she can call
off the rescue.

820
00:58:36,811 --> 00:58:39,380
What do you want?
I obeyed all your rules.

821
00:58:39,414 --> 00:58:42,485
Look! The transfer is
almost done.

822
00:58:44,219 --> 00:58:45,554
Then you'll get paid.

823
00:58:45,586 --> 00:58:50,458
I don't want to get paid.
I just want my wife!

824
00:58:52,393 --> 00:58:55,663
Line is secure! I'm coming over!

825
00:58:58,599 --> 00:58:59,835
Stop climbing!

826
00:58:59,867 --> 00:59:01,503
It's not me.

827
00:59:01,802 --> 00:59:03,271
The plane's climbing
on it's own.

828
00:59:04,639 --> 00:59:06,642
Oh my God!

829
00:59:07,342 --> 00:59:09,478
We broke the rules!

830
00:59:10,378 --> 00:59:13,481
They warned us it was going to
happen, but we didn't listen.

831
00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:22,157
- The planes have to be parallel for me to get over!
- It's not me.

832
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:24,260
You're going to
snap the line!

833
00:59:40,208 --> 00:59:43,112
No! Not until they're in!

834
00:59:49,550 --> 00:59:53,554
Everybody turn away! Don't look!

835
00:59:53,588 --> 00:59:57,093
Deploying our landing gear to create
some drag and slow our ascent.

836
00:59:59,927 --> 01:00:01,630
Why won't it stop?

837
01:00:18,179 --> 01:00:19,614
Well?

838
01:00:19,648 --> 01:00:22,550
Well, what? It didn't work.

839
01:00:22,951 --> 01:00:25,253
Khalib, you okay?

840
01:00:25,286 --> 01:00:27,455
How much damage did the
plane take from our hit?

841
01:00:27,489 --> 01:00:31,159
The circuitry in both wings is so damaged.
We could short out any second.

842
01:00:31,592 --> 01:00:33,895
There's only 800 pounds
of fuel left.

843
01:00:36,731 --> 01:00:38,800
Do we have enough
for another shot?

844
01:00:38,833 --> 01:00:41,670
No. Is LAX clear?

845
01:00:43,338 --> 01:00:45,240
It's totally evacuated.

846
01:00:45,673 --> 01:00:47,208
Escort us to the airport.

847
01:00:47,242 --> 01:00:50,612
That way the casualties on the ground
will be minimized when this plays out.

848
01:00:50,644 --> 01:00:52,815
And there's a chance some
of us will survive.

849
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:54,916
This is not over.

850
01:00:56,351 --> 01:00:59,320
This is La Vida 12-24 setting
a course for LAX.

851
01:00:59,353 --> 01:01:03,224
Make sure Alexis is okay.
And prepare the passengers.

852
01:01:15,503 --> 01:01:17,373
Here's your damn code,
okay? Now just-

853
01:01:18,505 --> 01:01:20,308
let the plane land.

854
01:01:24,278 --> 01:01:25,713
What? What is it?

855
01:01:28,416 --> 01:01:30,385
Is there something wrong?

856
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:34,389
You can't make it land?

857
01:01:41,463 --> 01:01:44,633
Kurt, is there anybody that you want to
text or message? You can use my phone.

858
01:01:44,666 --> 01:01:47,369
No, no, no. I got my own phone.
Thanks.

859
01:01:52,273 --> 01:01:53,942
I can fix this.

860
01:01:54,675 --> 01:01:56,478
I know I can.

861
01:02:00,315 --> 01:02:01,883
Sit down.

862
01:02:01,916 --> 01:02:03,418
Why won't you let me help?

863
01:02:03,451 --> 01:02:07,389
You can help by having a seat and
letting the professionals handle this.

864
01:02:07,755 --> 01:02:08,656
Whoa.

865
01:02:10,858 --> 01:02:12,860
Alexis needs help.

866
01:02:14,896 --> 01:02:17,333
Whoa. Whoa.
Sit down.

867
01:02:17,532 --> 01:02:19,735
- Oh my God! Are you okay?
- Don't...

868
01:02:19,967 --> 01:02:21,936
Don't ask me how I feel.

869
01:02:21,969 --> 01:02:23,571
I'm not okay.

870
01:02:24,806 --> 01:02:27,576
I told them. I told them
that this would happen.

871
01:02:27,608 --> 01:02:29,244
But they didn't listen.

872
01:02:29,844 --> 01:02:31,847
Why doesn't anyone ever
listen to me?

873
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:35,983
- Sir, I absolutely cannot. Now, sit down.
- Just give me ten seconds

874
01:02:36,016 --> 01:02:37,585
to check it out.

875
01:02:39,487 --> 01:02:41,889
What do you have to lose? Let me
get down there and take a look.

876
01:02:41,922 --> 01:02:43,858
If you don't sit down
right now...

877
01:02:43,891 --> 01:02:47,495
What could be more threatening than
me being on this plane right now?

878
01:02:47,528 --> 01:02:48,597
What's the problem?

879
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:50,065
Oh. There's not a problem.

880
01:02:50,097 --> 01:02:52,534
I'm just offering
a solution.

881
01:02:53,335 --> 01:02:54,869
- Alexis, this...
- Oh. No, no, no.

882
01:02:54,902 --> 01:02:56,605
What can you do?

883
01:02:56,871 --> 01:02:58,874
Let me look what's going on in
the Avionics Bay.

884
01:02:58,907 --> 01:03:00,776
I used to dismantle all
kinds of crap in Iraq

885
01:03:00,809 --> 01:03:03,845
and I bet my life what's down
there is very similar.

886
01:03:03,878 --> 01:03:07,849
Now, it maybe too complicated. I don't
know. But at least let me give it a shot.

887
01:03:07,882 --> 01:03:09,951
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What do
you plan on doing with that?

888
01:03:09,983 --> 01:03:12,688
I can either try to save the
plane or open a can of beans.

889
01:03:12,721 --> 01:03:14,289
- Which do you prefer?
- Hurry up! It's this way.

890
01:03:14,322 --> 01:03:17,525
- We can't have passengers in the restricted area.
- I'll be his escort.

891
01:03:17,559 --> 01:03:18,627
We need captain's
approval.

892
01:03:18,659 --> 01:03:20,594
Matthew, get off it already!

893
01:03:20,628 --> 01:03:23,365
I just saw JC die in
front of me.

894
01:03:23,398 --> 01:03:26,068
I tried to save him and I failed.
Now this man is offering to help us.

895
01:03:26,101 --> 01:03:30,472
And you're saying he can't
because it's against FAA protocol?

896
01:03:30,905 --> 01:03:34,043
Do you see anyone else
here offering to help?

897
01:03:34,909 --> 01:03:37,579
I didn't think so.
Move!

898
01:03:43,818 --> 01:03:45,887
I'm just trying to do
the right thing.

899
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:47,021
I know.

900
01:03:47,054 --> 01:03:51,527
No, you don't. Because if we do
survive this, I'm fired.

901
01:04:12,146 --> 01:04:13,715
Good news.

902
01:04:14,581 --> 01:04:16,117
I think I can help.

903
01:05:13,574 --> 01:05:16,611
Aah! Dammit!

904
01:05:26,054 --> 01:05:28,657
There's too much internal
electrical damage.

905
01:05:28,690 --> 01:05:30,125
What do you mean?

906
01:05:30,958 --> 01:05:32,960
It means we're screwed.

907
01:05:33,961 --> 01:05:35,664
- Where's Alexis?
- Get back to your seat.

908
01:05:35,697 --> 01:05:37,166
Where's Alexis?

909
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:38,500
Get away from him!

910
01:05:38,534 --> 01:05:40,802
Donna, that doesn't
belong to you.

911
01:05:40,835 --> 01:05:41,668
Donna, what are
you doing?

912
01:05:41,702 --> 01:05:43,971
Both of you. Back
to your seats.

913
01:05:44,005 --> 01:05:46,942
There's a reason you were so
concerned with this bag.

914
01:05:48,076 --> 01:05:50,711
You knew it was your way out if
something went wrong.

915
01:05:50,744 --> 01:05:53,047
That's standard military issue.

916
01:05:53,081 --> 01:05:54,583
Is that what this is?

917
01:05:58,152 --> 01:05:59,887
Oh my God.

918
01:06:00,755 --> 01:06:02,825
You're the terrorist.

919
01:06:03,590 --> 01:06:06,761
Sir. Step back and have a seat
on the jump seat.

920
01:06:07,094 --> 01:06:10,664
If I was a terrorist, then why
would I try to dismantle the device?

921
01:06:10,697 --> 01:06:12,701
Sir. I suggest you don't say
another word until we land

922
01:06:12,733 --> 01:06:14,969
the plane and the proper
authorities are involved.

923
01:06:15,003 --> 01:06:18,841
But she stole from me!

924
01:06:20,108 --> 01:06:25,614
Sir, sit down, okay?
And we can sort this all out.

925
01:06:25,914 --> 01:06:27,082
Why?

926
01:06:27,114 --> 01:06:29,517
So I can be the fall guy?

927
01:06:29,550 --> 01:06:32,653
Matthew, quick, get the
extension cord so we can strap him down.

928
01:06:32,686 --> 01:06:35,589
He's dangerous.
He can't be trusted.

929
01:06:35,623 --> 01:06:36,925
Bitch!

930
01:06:41,262 --> 01:06:43,999
Bullrush me and I'll slit
her fucking throat.

931
01:06:44,032 --> 01:06:45,634
Let her go, man.

932
01:06:45,666 --> 01:06:47,499
Don't do this.

933
01:06:46,534 --> 01:06:50,571
Everybody out.
Now.

934
01:06:50,605 --> 01:06:52,139
Now!

935
01:06:54,275 --> 01:06:57,546
You.
You stay.

936
01:06:58,780 --> 01:07:02,518
You.
Come with me.

937
01:07:03,117 --> 01:07:04,753
Come on.

938
01:07:04,786 --> 01:07:06,255
That's good.
Come on.

939
01:07:07,855 --> 01:07:09,224
Come on.

940
01:07:09,257 --> 01:07:11,159
Come on. Stop.

941
01:07:12,927 --> 01:07:14,162
- Open it.
- What?

942
01:07:14,195 --> 01:07:17,966
At this altitude we don't have
to worry about pressurization.

943
01:07:17,998 --> 01:07:20,634
Don't you think I
thought of that?

944
01:07:20,668 --> 01:07:26,074
Now be a good girl. Turn around
and help me put that parachute on.

945
01:07:28,675 --> 01:07:31,279
I didn't know you were
a dancer.

946
01:07:34,648 --> 01:07:35,616
Come on.

947
01:07:35,650 --> 01:07:38,586
You know about teamwork.
You're married, right?

948
01:07:40,153 --> 01:07:41,889
Help me.

949
01:07:47,894 --> 01:07:49,898
Middle strap.

950
01:08:02,043 --> 01:08:03,612
Not bad.

951
01:08:05,980 --> 01:08:08,282
How's that door coming?

952
01:08:13,987 --> 01:08:15,289
Now Donna!

953
01:08:15,322 --> 01:08:18,025
Hold on to me, tight!

954
01:08:18,059 --> 01:08:20,862
You're coming with me!

955
01:08:21,128 --> 01:08:22,463
Didn't you know?

956
01:08:22,497 --> 01:08:26,168
- You're the ransom.
- You're not taking her!

957
01:08:55,697 --> 01:08:56,864
Flight crew to flight deck.

958
01:08:56,898 --> 01:08:59,101
Flight crew to flight deck.

959
01:09:07,140 --> 01:09:09,344
Who opened the
emergency door?

960
01:09:09,377 --> 01:09:11,046
And what got sucked into
the engine?

961
01:09:13,780 --> 01:09:16,117
I think it was the terrorist

962
01:09:16,149 --> 01:09:18,420
who put the device on the plane.

963
01:09:19,220 --> 01:09:21,722
And also the only man that
could save us.

964
01:09:22,422 --> 01:09:24,224
This was found in
his belongings.

965
01:09:24,257 --> 01:09:26,795
Some kind of signal box.

966
01:09:27,028 --> 01:09:28,896
Radar jamming
equipment.

967
01:09:30,497 --> 01:09:33,367
I was sitting next to the
terrorist this whole time.

968
01:09:34,301 --> 01:09:35,903
I held his hand.

969
01:09:35,936 --> 01:09:39,207
Oh my God! What's wrong now?

970
01:09:39,239 --> 01:09:41,175
We have only seven minutes left.

971
01:09:42,042 --> 01:09:44,411
So, we can land the plane?

972
01:09:44,444 --> 01:09:46,246
Not with those devices
still attached.

973
01:09:46,279 --> 01:09:48,882
Those devices. They're rigged to
make us crash, right?

974
01:09:48,916 --> 01:09:51,319
Yes! We've been over this.

975
01:09:51,351 --> 01:09:55,990
So we just have to find a way
to crash this plane first.

976
01:09:57,824 --> 01:09:58,992
You want to do what?

977
01:09:59,025 --> 01:10:02,430
That overriding device isn't as
complicated as it appears.

978
01:10:02,997 --> 01:10:05,267
Pull up the photos
I took earlier.

979
01:10:06,367 --> 01:10:07,869
Looking at
them right now.

980
01:10:07,902 --> 01:10:09,837
The overriding equipment is
powered by the aircraft

981
01:10:09,871 --> 01:10:11,472
just like the equipment
on the plane.

982
01:10:11,506 --> 01:10:13,942
The call lights, the water
heaters, USB ports.

983
01:10:13,975 --> 01:10:17,145
<i>Zoom in on the
right side of the first photo I took.</i>

984
01:10:17,177 --> 01:10:19,948
<i>Look at the wires
that are attached.</i>

985
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:26,019
They feed directly into a unit that
looks like a compressor of some kind.

986
01:10:26,052 --> 01:10:27,587
Exactly.

987
01:10:27,621 --> 01:10:30,891
Which means its only getting its power
by the aircraft and its generators.

988
01:10:30,925 --> 01:10:33,161
Not the battery or the
back-up. If the device loses its

989
01:10:33,194 --> 01:10:35,530
power source, it will go dead
and no longer able to carry out

990
01:10:35,563 --> 01:10:38,500
the malfunction to cutting
the hydraulic lines.

991
01:10:38,533 --> 01:10:42,237
Right now I'm only running on
a few pounds of fuel and one engine.

992
01:10:42,270 --> 01:10:45,874
With my fuel gone, I will lose power
and have to initiate a glided landing.

993
01:10:45,907 --> 01:10:48,543
But the motor from the right engine
will still be powering the generator,

994
01:10:48,576 --> 01:10:50,811
which means the device
will be active and

995
01:10:50,845 --> 01:10:53,515
initiate a malfunction once
I fall below 500 feet.

996
01:10:53,547 --> 01:10:56,251
But if I no longer had that
engine to power the generators...

997
01:10:56,283 --> 01:10:59,554
Then there would be no aircraft
power for the device to feed off of.

998
01:10:59,587 --> 01:11:01,890
Is there anyway for you
to cut the engine?

999
01:11:01,922 --> 01:11:03,423
No.

1000
01:11:03,457 --> 01:11:05,060
But you can.

1001
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:09,965
I need the F-18 that's been
tailing us to shoot out the engine.

1002
01:11:16,537 --> 01:11:17,905
Prepare the cabin.

1003
01:11:17,939 --> 01:11:19,207
We're going home.

1004
01:11:30,150 --> 01:11:31,853
Why isn't it landing?

1005
01:11:31,886 --> 01:11:35,023
Thank you for your services.
Here's your payment as agreed.

1006
01:11:36,056 --> 01:11:36,925
What?

1007
01:11:36,957 --> 01:11:38,592
May I have my code, please?

1008
01:11:38,626 --> 01:11:41,095
Not until my wife is
safely on the ground.

1009
01:11:41,127 --> 01:11:47,335
Unforeseen errors have occurred. Now I
suggest you take this money and leave. Now.

1010
01:11:48,101 --> 01:11:50,037
Once they finish sifting through
the debris from that plane,

1011
01:11:50,070 --> 01:11:52,006
they're going to find out that
the code that cause the

1012
01:11:52,038 --> 01:11:56,210
malfunction was created by
B. Samuels of GioTech.

1013
01:12:00,014 --> 01:12:01,048
How?

1014
01:12:01,082 --> 01:12:03,084
While you were transferring
data onto my drive,

1015
01:12:03,117 --> 01:12:06,054
it was also transferring data
onto your system.

1016
01:12:10,957 --> 01:12:14,228
- My wife is still in the sky. The deal was she'd be on the...
- You can buy another one

1017
01:12:14,261 --> 01:12:18,132
with all the money that I'm giving you.
Now give me my drive.

1018
01:12:21,167 --> 01:12:23,337
Give me my drive.

1019
01:12:33,146 --> 01:12:34,282
Fine.

1020
01:12:35,983 --> 01:12:37,217
I'll take the deal.

1021
01:12:37,251 --> 01:12:39,154
May I?

1022
01:12:41,622 --> 01:12:43,490
Women in Dubai, huh?

1023
01:12:44,057 --> 01:12:45,592
You think they'll go for
a guy like me?

1024
01:12:45,626 --> 01:12:47,529
Give me my drive.

1025
01:12:47,962 --> 01:12:50,465
So this is ten million dollars
in a Swiss Bank Account.

1026
01:12:50,497 --> 01:12:52,933
How do I possibly know that
this is any good?

1027
01:12:52,966 --> 01:12:59,406
It activates with a simple code online. Which
I will give you once you give me my drive.

1028
01:13:00,573 --> 01:13:02,176
No.

1029
01:13:02,976 --> 01:13:04,345
You first.

1030
01:13:05,546 --> 01:13:07,181
Shall we?

1031
01:13:12,052 --> 01:13:13,354
Go ahead and boot this us.

1032
01:13:13,386 --> 01:13:16,023
And we can be...

1033
01:13:46,453 --> 01:13:48,555
Tell me how to save my wife!

1034
01:13:49,289 --> 01:13:50,557
I'm sorry.

1035
01:13:53,327 --> 01:13:56,264
She was dead before
we even started.

1036
01:13:57,198 --> 01:13:58,400
I'm sorry.

1037
01:14:18,485 --> 01:14:21,256
So-Cal Approach, I have
visual on LAX tarmac.

1038
01:14:21,555 --> 01:14:26,226
Will begin descent for an emergency
landing on Runway 2-5 left.

1039
01:14:26,260 --> 01:14:29,396
<i>Roger that,
La Vida 12-24. How's your fuel?</i>

1040
01:14:32,065 --> 01:14:34,101
Still a few drops to run on.

1041
01:14:36,037 --> 01:14:39,007
Khalib, do you know
what you're doing?

1042
01:14:40,140 --> 01:14:42,609
No. Do you?

1043
01:14:43,577 --> 01:14:47,414
The ammunition the F-18 carries is
about the size of a coke bottle.

1044
01:14:48,282 --> 01:14:50,117
Should only take a few rounds
to blow out the engine.

1045
01:14:50,150 --> 01:14:54,121
<i>We've assured the pilot
is one of the finest Top Guns in the nation.</i>

1046
01:14:54,154 --> 01:14:55,456
<i>Targeting system is top-notch.</i>

1047
01:14:55,488 --> 01:14:57,557
<i>This could go downhill fast.</i>

1048
01:14:57,591 --> 01:15:00,294
Everybody to the backside of the
plane. Come on. Let's go. Okay.

1049
01:15:00,327 --> 01:15:02,130
It wasn't a full flight so
there's plenty of space.

1050
01:15:02,162 --> 01:15:04,164
Away from the engines.
Away from the engines.

1051
01:15:04,198 --> 01:15:05,666
Where's Alexis?

1052
01:15:05,698 --> 01:15:08,068
So-Cal Approach, once we've lost
power, I'll switch to my cell

1053
01:15:08,101 --> 01:15:10,238
phone so we can still
communicate.

1054
01:15:10,270 --> 01:15:11,773
<i>Confirmed.</i>

1055
01:15:23,650 --> 01:15:26,520
Flight crew. Please prepare for
emergency landing.

1056
01:15:27,287 --> 01:15:30,424
Okay. Fasten your seat belts.
Strap yourselves in. Heads down. Knees up.

1057
01:15:30,457 --> 01:15:32,692
Heads down. Knees up.
Alexis!

1058
01:15:32,725 --> 01:15:34,295
I'll go get her.

1059
01:15:34,328 --> 01:15:35,563
I'll go get her.

1060
01:15:36,697 --> 01:15:39,100
Please. Please sit beside me.

1061
01:15:39,132 --> 01:15:43,337
If we're going to die, I want my
daughter to think I wasn't alone.

1062
01:15:46,573 --> 01:15:50,277
Target confirmed.
Will commence fire in fifteen seconds.

1063
01:15:50,310 --> 01:15:53,781
Alexis?
Alexis?

1064
01:15:56,417 --> 01:15:58,486
Alexis, where are you?

1065
01:16:03,224 --> 01:16:04,726
Alexis?

1066
01:16:08,895 --> 01:16:12,366
So-Cal Approach, I'm on glide
and on course.

1067
01:16:19,606 --> 01:16:21,676
- Alexis!
- Yeah. I'm back here.

1068
01:16:21,708 --> 01:16:23,644
- What are you doing?
- Donna, I'm so scared.

1069
01:16:23,676 --> 01:16:26,146
I know. Me too.
But we have to sit down.

1070
01:16:26,180 --> 01:16:29,784
10, 9, 8, 7, 6...

1071
01:16:29,817 --> 01:16:31,618
I don't know how I'm
going to do this.

1072
01:16:31,652 --> 01:16:34,387
Just don't think about it.
Come on. Come on.

1073
01:16:34,421 --> 01:16:35,756
Will you help me?

1074
01:16:35,788 --> 01:16:38,792
- Yeah.
- Okay. I can count on you to cooperate?

1075
01:16:38,826 --> 01:16:41,096
Yeah. What do you need me to do?

1076
01:16:47,234 --> 01:16:48,369
Alexis.

1077
01:16:49,802 --> 01:16:50,805
Don't scream.

1078
01:16:50,837 --> 01:16:51,872
Fire!

1079
01:17:28,475 --> 01:17:30,278
It was never supposed
to go there.

1080
01:17:30,844 --> 01:17:34,181
We arranged to blow up
your hotel in Brazil,

1081
01:17:34,215 --> 01:17:38,685
but you shot that plan to hell when
you decided to leave early.

1082
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:56,337
Now that you see how easy it
is for me to kill you,

1083
01:17:56,369 --> 01:17:59,472
let's discuss what will
keep you alive.

1084
01:17:59,506 --> 01:18:04,545
- The code for Genesis 7.
- The code is Benjy's. It's not mine!

1085
01:18:04,578 --> 01:18:05,947
But you're married,
right?

1086
01:18:05,979 --> 01:18:10,284
Fifty-fifty, huh?
So it's technically yours.

1087
01:18:21,895 --> 01:18:23,831
Donna! Donna!
Is that you?

1088
01:18:23,863 --> 01:18:28,635
- Donna, are you still on the plane?
- Benjy! Oh, Benjy!

1089
01:18:29,036 --> 01:18:31,439
Do you have the code
for Genesis 7?

1090
01:18:31,471 --> 01:18:33,373
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Who wants it?

1091
01:18:33,407 --> 01:18:35,876
I should have never hesitated.
I know that now, okay?

1092
01:18:35,908 --> 01:18:37,310
All I want is you.

1093
01:18:37,344 --> 01:18:39,948
I know.
I know you do.

1094
01:18:40,413 --> 01:18:42,550
Tell him. Now.

1095
01:18:43,050 --> 01:18:45,886
Donna.
Listen, I love you.

1096
01:18:45,918 --> 01:18:48,256
I love you too, Benjy.

1097
01:18:48,689 --> 01:18:50,391
I couldn't bare to live
without you.

1098
01:18:50,423 --> 01:18:52,792
I know that now.

1099
01:18:52,826 --> 01:18:55,796
And that's why you have
to forgive me.

1100
01:18:55,828 --> 01:18:57,264
For what?

1101
01:18:57,297 --> 01:18:59,766
I'm going to let you save me.

1102
01:19:23,390 --> 01:19:24,759
Hold on tight!

1103
01:20:09,103 --> 01:20:11,038
What happened to Alexis?

1104
01:20:12,472 --> 01:20:13,807
It was her.

1105
01:20:14,140 --> 01:20:16,576
The terrorist was her.

1106
01:20:31,824 --> 01:20:33,426
Captain Khalib.

1107
01:20:33,460 --> 01:20:34,962
Agent Coleman.

1108
01:20:34,994 --> 01:20:37,497
You took your time.

1109
01:20:37,898 --> 01:20:39,967
Congratulations.

1110
01:20:41,635 --> 01:20:43,805
Sir.

1111
01:20:45,506 --> 01:20:49,577
I'm ashamed of my behavior
and I owe you an apology.

1112
01:20:49,810 --> 01:20:53,514
But I was right.
You're not like me.

1113
01:20:54,914 --> 01:20:56,649
You're better.

1114
01:20:58,886 --> 01:21:00,855
That's kind of you to say.

1115
01:21:03,189 --> 01:21:06,559
God. I need a drink before I see the brat.
Who has a good martini?

1116
01:21:06,592 --> 01:21:08,528
One of my favorite places
in Echo Park.

1117
01:21:08,561 --> 01:21:10,631
Well, come on.
I'll buy it for you.

1118
01:21:10,663 --> 01:21:12,565
You mean, you're going to
buy me a drink?

1119
01:21:12,599 --> 01:21:14,702
Oh no, honey.
After what we've been through,

1120
01:21:14,734 --> 01:21:19,106
- I'm going to buy you the whole damn bar.
- Come on.

1121
01:21:19,539 --> 01:21:20,875
Mmm.

1122
01:21:20,908 --> 01:21:22,510
Benjy!

1123
01:21:38,559 --> 01:21:40,194
I love you more than
everything.

1124
01:21:40,226 --> 01:21:41,429
You did it.

1125
01:21:41,462 --> 01:21:43,097
We did.

1126
01:21:44,497 --> 01:21:46,065
So, what do you want to
do now?

1127
01:21:46,099 --> 01:21:47,869
Start over.

1128
01:21:53,841 --> 01:21:55,743
Hey. Hey.
Listen.

1129
01:21:56,143 --> 01:21:59,113
I owe you a real honeymoon,
okay? I do. Together.

1130
01:21:59,145 --> 01:22:03,483
Just you and me. We can go anywhere
you want. Alright? Just tell me.

1131
01:22:03,516 --> 01:22:05,618
We can fly out tonight
if you want.

1132
01:22:05,652 --> 01:22:08,689
Let's just drive please.

1133
01:22:31,677 --> 01:22:33,747
Are you Hans Fensen?

1134
01:22:33,779 --> 01:22:34,881
Yeah.

1135
01:22:35,882 --> 01:22:37,885
Today you're going to
make one of two choices.

1136
01:22:46,883 --> 01:22:51,883
