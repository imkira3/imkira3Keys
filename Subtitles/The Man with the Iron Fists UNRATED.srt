MADAM BLOSSOM:
In fact, our Jungle
wasn't always an outpost.

652
01:11:32,997 --> 01:11:34,748
Rumor has it,
the Fourth Emperor

653
01:11:34,832 --> 01:11:36,917
built a magnificent tomb
for his queen

654
01:11:37,001 --> 01:11:38,960
directly beneath
our village.

655
01:11:39,045 --> 01:11:40,504
Oh, that's fascinating.

656
01:11:40,713 --> 01:11:42,297
(BOTH LAUGHING)

657
01:11:43,341 --> 01:11:45,467
Here. To good fortune.

658
01:11:45,551 --> 01:11:47,052
Good fortune.

659
01:11:47,386 --> 01:11:50,889
Now, when the captain of
the Jackals arrives with
his many armed troops,

660
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:53,975
where do you suppose
he's going to attack?

661
01:11:55,603 --> 01:11:58,647
Well, presumably
the Lions' base.

662
01:11:58,731 --> 01:12:02,567
Exactly, and they'll come
not only for gold,
but also for lives.

663
01:12:03,528 --> 01:12:07,364
We see the Madam
is well informed.

664
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:10,575
(CHUCKLES) My sheets know
every secret in this town.

665
01:12:11,661 --> 01:12:14,371
Gentlemen,
we've had dinner.

666
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:18,250
Now, dessert.

667
01:12:27,426 --> 01:12:28,468
Oh. (CHUCKLES)

01:12:34,767 --> 01:12:36,601

(CHUCKLES)

670
01:13:02,795 --> 01:13:05,797
The Fourth Emperor,
a man of imagination.

671
01:13:06,799 --> 01:13:08,800
And I thought lies
were your stock-in-trade.

672
01:13:08,884 --> 01:13:12,095
Not stock.
Just trade.

673
01:13:12,346 --> 01:13:14,014
What do you have in mind?

674
01:13:15,266 --> 01:13:18,435
You store your gold here,
less the 3% that goes to me,

675
01:13:18,519 --> 01:13:22,981
along with the right
to control my women,
my way, as I always have.

676
01:13:23,858 --> 01:13:25,734
One way in,
one way out?

677
01:13:25,818 --> 01:13:27,652
Of course.

678
01:13:27,737 --> 01:13:29,988
Three percent
is quite steep.

679
01:13:30,072 --> 01:13:31,656
Four percent.

680
01:13:31,741 --> 01:13:32,824
POISON DAGGER: My friend,

681
01:13:33,451 --> 01:13:38,288
better 3% to the madam
than 100% to the Jackals.

682
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:42,834
All right,
we have a deal.

683
01:13:51,469 --> 01:13:54,387
Now, we need a lot of
action from you coming
from the South Gate.

684
01:13:54,472 --> 01:13:55,764
Try and make some noise.

685
01:13:55,848 --> 01:13:57,932
We want the others to
think there's an attack.

686
01:13:58,017 --> 01:13:59,476
No problem.

687
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:03,355
I presume you're coming in
from the chopstick gate
in the north here.

688
01:14:04,231 --> 01:14:07,734
And I'll keep
the southern gate locked up
until you get there.

689
01:14:08,235 --> 01:14:10,695
About how much time do we have
before the Jackals arrive?

690
01:14:11,072 --> 01:14:12,656
Dawn.

691
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:16,534
If we don't get
this done before then,

692
01:14:17,370 --> 01:14:19,245
it'll be the end
of the village.

to the Blossom's.

Of course you do,

The only difference
between you and me
is the poison we use.

815
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:53,538
Opium?

816
01:35:53,623 --> 01:35:54,956
It's not a poison.

817
01:35:55,458 --> 01:35:56,667
And it's not a curse.

818
01:35:56,751 --> 01:36:00,962
It is a benefit and a solace
to the hardworking Chinese.

819
01:36:02,465 --> 01:36:04,299
And the occasional
Englishman.

820
01:36:06,427 --> 01:36:08,303
I'll see you in hell.

821
01:36:08,388 --> 01:36:10,639
I suppose you will.
(COUGHING)

822
01:36:11,516 --> 01:36:13,100
Save me a spot
by the fire.

823
01:36:13,184 --> 01:36:14,309
(LAUGHING)

824
01:36:21,442 --> 01:36:24,319
SILVER LION:
I'm to your right.
I'm to your left.

825
01:36:32,161 --> 01:36:33,662
What took you so long?

826
01:36:34,580 --> 01:36:36,707
Got caught up
looking at yourself
in the mirror?

827
01:36:37,667 --> 01:36:38,667
(GROANS)

828
01:36:39,419 --> 01:36:41,253
Now you die,
little brother.

829
01:36:51,639 --> 01:36:53,849
Gold Lion raised you
as a son.

830
01:36:57,145 --> 01:36:59,146
Why would you betray us?

831
01:36:59,230 --> 01:37:00,856
This was my time.

832
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:04,025
(SHOUTING) My time!

833
01:37:07,572 --> 01:37:09,364
And this is my gold.

834
01:37:11,409 --> 01:37:13,368
Well, here's your gold.

835
01:37:16,748 --> 01:37:17,831
(SCREAMING)

836
01:37:43,191 --> 01:37:46,026
I'm gonna drill you
like I drilled
your little whore.

837
01:37:46,235 --> 01:37:47,611
(GRUNTING)

838
01:39:08,651 --> 01:39:10,735
JACKAL LIEUTENANT:
By order of the emperor,

839
01:39:10,820 --> 01:39:13,488
you have five seconds
to bring out the gold,

840
01:39:13,573 --> 01:39:15,532
or we will kill you all.

841
01:39:15,658 --> 01:39:16,658
Five.

842
01:39:18,744 --> 01:39:19,995
Four.

843
01:39:21,289 --> 01:39:22,414
Three.

844
01:39:24,083 --> 01:39:25,333
Two.

845
01:39:26,669 --> 01:39:27,752
One.

846
01:39:28,713 --> 01:39:30,422
Gentlemen!

847
01:39:30,965 --> 01:39:34,676
Colonel Jack C. Wales,
emissary of the emperor.

848
01:39:35,887 --> 01:39:40,265
Everything here
is under control.

849
01:39:44,103 --> 01:39:45,604
(SOLDIER SHOUTING ORDERS)

850
01:39:51,652 --> 01:39:52,903
(EXHALES)

851
01:39:53,571 --> 01:39:54,821
Good.

852
01:40:07,835 --> 01:40:10,295
My friend,
I've lost a father,

853
01:40:12,048 --> 01:40:13,381
but I gained a brother.

854
01:40:32,276 --> 01:40:33,276
Thaddeus.

855
01:40:33,444 --> 01:40:34,569
Jack.

856
01:40:35,488 --> 01:40:36,488
Thanks.

857
01:40:36,614 --> 01:40:38,156
No, thank you.

858
01:40:38,240 --> 01:40:41,368
I haven't had this much fun
since we protected
the crown in Macau.

859
01:40:53,089 --> 01:40:54,839
BLACKSMITH:
The Chinese say,

860
01:40:54,924 --> 01:40:57,509
"Where there is iron,
there is rust."

861
01:40:57,593 --> 01:40:59,844
Well, not anymore.

862
01:40:59,929 --> 01:41:01,805
Jungle Village was clean.

863
01:41:02,723 --> 01:41:05,350
And I'm gonna make sure
that it stays that way.

864
01:41:13,818 --> 01:41:15,527
(RAP SONG PLAYING)

865
01:45:44,171 --> 01:45:50,635
Chi Chi.

866
01:45:53,389 --> 01:45:56,432
Chi Chi! Chi Chi!

867
01:46:02,481 --> 01:46:17,495

(SHOUTING)

869
01:46:42,146 --> 01:46:43,146
My brother,

870
01:46:47,276 --> 01:46:49,318
I'm in need of
your hands again.
