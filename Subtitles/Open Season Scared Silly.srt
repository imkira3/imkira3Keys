1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,411
It was a dark and stormy night.

3
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,049
The storm was electrical. No rain.

4
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,362
Too bad, because we could use some.

5
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,725
Okay, everybody.

6
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,923
Joke's over. Come on out.

7
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,687
Ian? Is that you?
I'm pretty vulnerable out here.

8
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:19,126
I'm just a doe, a deer, a female deer,
out in the woods all alone.

9
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,487
Where are you going, you simple lass?

10
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,002
To check on that noise. I want to
make sure it isn't a scary monster.

11
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:29,449
Only a buffoon in a horror movie
investigates creepy sounds...

12
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,204
instead of running away.

13
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,166
Now stand back while I investigate
instead of running away.

14
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:43,044
By those claw marks,
I'd wager that's none other...

15
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,091
than the Wailing Wampus Werewolf. Hold me.

16
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,370
I thought that was a legend.

17
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,569
Aye, the legend lives.

18
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:02,126
They needed a hero.
And they were about to get one.

19
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,850
Who can protect us?

20
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,040
I can!

21
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,287
Elliot!

22
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,891
You're just in time, lad.

23
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,567
Oh, Elliot. I don't know
how you find the courage.

24
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,405
It just comes with being
a Wailing Wampus Werewolf whisperer.

25
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,971
Say that three times fast.

26
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,203
Wailing Wampus Werewolf Whisperer,
Wailing Rumpus Rufleaf Rolips.

27
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:27,127
Weeling Rimpless Roplips...
I can't do it! I'm not as skilled as you.

28
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,601
It's okay, McSquizzy. I'll handle this.

29
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,526
The werewolf communicates
through interpretive dance, and so can I.

30
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,081
Elliot, please be careful.
It's so dangerous.

31
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,928
Danger is my maiden name.
Now stay here while I defend our home.

32
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,160
There goes the bravest
and most handsomest muledeer...

33
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,328
that ever graced this earth.

34
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,891
Moose pucky!

35
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,285
Your story's a sack of wee jobbies,
you daft tube!

36
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:13,003
Who tells a story in black and white
anyways, you jug-eared galoot!

37
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,208
Hello? It's called atmosphere.

38
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,364
Only a complete imbecile
would ever believe...

39
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,729
such a ridiculous story about a werewolf.

40
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,726
Actually, I find his story
quite convincing.

41
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,082
Thanks, Boog. I can always count on you.

42
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,006
There was no doubt about it,
that werewolf meant business.

43
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,650
Blood business.

44
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,440
Now, werewolves aren't like you and me.

45
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,810
Unless you enjoy ripping lungs out of
things. But hey, who am I to judge.

46
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,328
I'm sure there are some perfectly nice
werewolves out there...

47
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,565
just waiting to be friends.
But not this werewolf. Oh, no.

48
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,451
The Wailing Wampus Werewolf
is a different breed.

49
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,888
He stalks the forest,
looking for the biggest...

50
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,850
juiciest tub of lard he can find.

51
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,171
One thing's for sure:
This werewolf wanted to devour me.

52
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,760
Okay. All right. Time to turn in.

53
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,809
But he was just getting to the best part.

54
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,611
Yeah, Boog, this is when
I really bring the scares home.

55
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,969
I stood face to face with the rabid beast.

56
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,009
Oh, you poor deer.

57
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:31,367
- I could smell its smelly breath.
- I bet it smelled awful.

58
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,482
Its claws were long and sharp.

59
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,248
Well, you sure can paint a picture,
Elliot. On that note...

60
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,041
There was only one thing sharper than
the werewolf's claws.

61
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,044
Keep it together, Boog.
Come on, go to your happy place.

62
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,089
Its deadly fangs!

63
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,848
He's worse than the bunnies.

64
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,731
Let's take a short intermission.
There's refreshments at the lake.

65
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,929
And by that I mean you can drink
the lake, which is refreshing.

66
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,127
I'll be right back.

67
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,686
Boog, that was awesome.
You made the story so real.

68
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,411
When you wet yourself,
that really pushed it over the top.

69
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,531
Yeah. Yeah, that's it. I was trying to
help you sell your story.

70
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,490
Thanks to you, that was
the scariest one I told all week.

71
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,689
These werewolf stories
aren't actually true. Are they?

72
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,365
You have nothing to worry about.

73
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,367
They're absolutely true.

74
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,569
The Wailing Wampus Werewolf is real
and ready to pounce.

75
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,085
That's what I was worried about.

76
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,122
Wait a minute. You're actually afraid.

77
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,965
- Am not.
- Am too.

78
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,442
- Am not.
- Am too, am too, am too, am too.

79
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,931
Am not?

80
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,282
All right. I'm afraid. Happy now?

81
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,843
I knew it! Wait, what are you afraid of?

82
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:58,204
Listen, I didn't grow up in the woods.
I lived in a cozy garage, remember?

83
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,326
I had a comfy bed with my own blanky.

84
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:05,405
A bowl with my name on it, I think.
Fishy crackers.

85
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,847
And Wheel of Fortune on TV!

86
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,963
Hey! Is that a unicycle?
You got the best flashbacks, Boog.

87
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,088
Point is, I was safe.

88
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,529
You'll be fine. You're the fattest animal
in the forest.

89
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,842
That's why the werewolf
will come for me first.

90
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,685
I'm its main competition.
I've gotta get away.

91
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:28,367
You are getting away. We're going on
that camping trip. Remember?

92
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,205
I am not going camping
with a monster out there.

93
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,728
You can't bail on this trip.
We've been planning it for three years.

94
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,326
Think of the river rafting.
The boogie boards!

95
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,721
Perfect for a guy named Boog! Zip lines.

96
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,685
Snorkeling. Parasailing.
It'll be relaxing.

97
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,360
You expect me to relax
when a werewolf is after me?

98
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,124
But you promised you'd go.

99
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,966
And when you make a promise to a friend,
that's a promise to the end.

100
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,881
Because you never ever abandon
your friend. Everyone knows that.

101
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,567
I'm sorry, Elliot. I can't.
I'm gonna build a panic room...

102
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,961
and hide until the werewolf
dies from old age.

103
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,690
So what's a panic room?

104
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,322
It's a safe place you can lock yourself into
to keep the werewolves out.

105
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,563
First, you dig a hole.
Say this acorn is me.

106
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,087
And this ladybug is the werewolf.

107
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,881
So the ladybug tries to eat me, see?
But she can't.

108
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,721
So you're afraid
of ladybugs, too? Therapy.

109
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:30,804
I, Elliot Deer Esquire Junior the Third,
née Danger, am hereby making it...

110
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,769
my mission to help you overcome...

111
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,207
your fear of the werewolf and ladybugs.

112
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,441
Please don't do anything.

113
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,166
Don't worry, Boog.
Nothing bad is gonna happen.

114
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:44,042
Something bad has happened!
Something really, really bad!

115
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,804
- Mr. Weenie!
- What are you doing out here?

116
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,769
- Is it the werewolf?
- Worse!

117
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,082
My beloved owner Bobbie is gone.

118
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,090
So is Bob, who I get along with
but I'm not as close to.

119
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,647
- What happened?
- I woke up in the RV...

120
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,486
and they were not there.
I will obviously never see them again.

121
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,801
Maybe they went on a trip.

122
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,162
Or maybe the Wailing Wampus Werewolf
got them.

123
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,606
You're really not helping.

124
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:09,288
The unihorn is right. That has to be it.
There can be no other explanation.

125
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,408
Don't worry.
We'll get to the bottom of this.

126
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,849
We'll take out that bloodthirsty,
impossibly large and vicious...

127
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,321
werewolf and then
we'll go on that camping trip.

128
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,801
See you in the morning, Boogster.
Sweet dreams.

129
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,125
- Elliot?
- Yeah, Boog?

130
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,760
Don't tell anyone
I'm afraid of the werewolf.

131
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:30,403
Don't worry. We're speaking
in the pine cone of silence.

132
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,282
Guess what, everybody!
Boog is afraid of the werewolf!

133
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,408
You mean that was not an act?

134
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,882
- Nope. He's genuinely terrified.
- Your stories aren't even true.

135
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,401
What? How can you say that?
They're totally true.

136
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,086
You've never even seen
this so-called werewolf.

137
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,722
I've never seen my so-called brain,
but I'm pretty sure I've got one.

138
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,925
If you ask me, I saw this coming
a long time ago.

139
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,924
I knew that bear
couldn't hack it out here.

140
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:03,484
He's more like an em-bear-assment.
Get it? Em-bear-assment.

141
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,007
Go easy on Boog. We all have our fears.

142
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,528
- McSquizzy fears nothing!
- See what I mean?

143
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,650
And, Maria, you're afraid you're never
gonna find someone...

144
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,406
that you'll end up a spinster
living with two pet bobcats.

145
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,928
Actually I wasn't afraid of that.
Until now.

146
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,566
Mr. Weenie, you're afraid of hot dog buns.

147
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,451
Yeah! And pickle relish. And mustard!

148
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,409
Serge, you're afraid of duct tape.

149
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,801
Reilly, you're afraid of splinters.

150
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,288
And, Buddy, balloons scare
the quills off of you.

151
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,088
Balloons.

152
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,484
And I'm afraid of whatever crazy thing
you're gonna do...

153
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,250
to help Boog overcome his fear.

154
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,688
You see, even Giselle is afraid.
But I've got a brilliant plan.

155
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,530
- It involves all of us.
- Here we go.

156
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,001
We're gonna scare the fear out of Boog.

157
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,561
And how exactly are we gonna do that?

158
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,451
Here's the plan.
Ian, you're gonna be the star.

159
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,647
Naturally.

160
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,121
We're gonna take some skunks
and throw in some ducks...

161
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:14,601
Beth! Dinkelman! We're home! It was all
just a real long bad dream!

162
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,601
Oh, Beth, I'm so glad to see you! I knew
you would never dump me in the woods!

163
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,321
Beth?

164
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,645
Nightmare.

165
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,805
Are you trying to scare me?

166
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:46,806
I was trying to say your name, but you
jumped before I got to the "guh" sound.

167
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,480
Boo-guh. You're so impatient.

168
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,971
I'm really not in the mood.

169
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,044
I've got something
that will make you happy.

170
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,361
Where'd you find that?

171
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,643
My main bear, Dinkelman.
Actually, you're my main bear.

172
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,320
Dinkelman's my second main bear.
Smokey's my third.

173
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,364
Do you want your baby doll back?

174
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,849
No one touches my Dinkelman.

175
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,603
Hey! That was my last one.

176
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,882
Lucky for you, a little bird told me
a new shipment of Woo-Hoo bars...

177
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,884
came into town. You've met Jerry, right?
The little bird?

178
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,522
We can't go into town, the trail
will expose us to the werewolf.

179
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,730
- Not if we take the shortcut.
- Shortcut?

180
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,370
Yep. The shortcut.

181
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,129
- Well, that looks nice.
- Yeah, we're going over there.

182
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:45,205
- Through Dead Bear Gulch?
- Is there a problem?

183
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,082
I'm a bear. Also, I'm a bear!
I don't want to die.

184
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,811
All bears die. Some bears never live.

185
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,880
Let's get you into that gulch.

186
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,807
No way. Nothing good ever happens
in a gulch. Especially not in that one.

187
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,327
Boog, I got your back. And your front.

188
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,403
Cootchie-cootchie-coo.
You're totally covered.

189
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,171
I don't know.

190
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,244
If not for me,
then do it for Woo-Know-Hoo.

191
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,644
Oh, man! Why can't I follow my instincts
instead of my nose?

192
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:19,286
Wait, you can't leave.
What if I never see you again?

193
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,681
We're only going to town.

194
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,090
That's what Bobbie told me just before
she was eaten by a werewolf.

195
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,130
If it makes you feel any better,
you can hang with us, Mr. Weenie.

196
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:32,171
Oh, joyful day!
My good luck has returned at last.

197
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:46,444
Come on, tree huggers!
That tree is not part of the tour.

198
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:50,964
Lap it up, granola buffs.
Here's nature in all its gory.

199
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:55,485
I mean glory. Trees and this thing.

200
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,971
Awesome.

201
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:02,765
Mr. Shaw? Exactly how long
have you been a nature guide?

202
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:07,130
Too long. Ever since they declared
open season illegal...

203
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,489
I've had to find another use
for my unique talents.

204
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:15,322
Good news is, as a nature guide,
I can still shoot whatever I see...

205
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,286
- Oh, no!
- With a camera.

206
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,244
Oh, what a cute camera.

207
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:27,368
Take a gander, boys and girls.
We've arrived at Dead Bear Gulch.

208
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,168
- I've heard it's haunted.
- Me too.

209
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,290
Isn't this where the Wailing
Wampus Werewolf was last sighted?

210
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,649
There's no werewolf down there.
That's crazy talk.

211
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,282
A rumor propagated by the animals
to distract us...

212
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,284
from their overall plan
of world domination.

213
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,965
Okay.

214
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,841
Well, let's get those sandals
flip flopping.

215
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,049
If you're lucky, maybe we'll see a bird
or something.

216
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,771
If you're really lucky,
maybe it'll be dead.

217
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,042
What did I tell you, Boog?
It's not so scary here.

218
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,321
Sure, there's spooky mist.

219
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,606
Die.

220
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,567
Bottomless pits that lead to
the bowels of the earth.

221
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:19,289
I said "bottomless" and "bowels"
in the same sentence.

222
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,569
And evil, dead trees
that have "kill" on their minds.

223
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,850
But on the whole it's quite pleasant.

224
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,362
Excuse me one moment.
I think I hear my mom calling.

225
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,200
He's coming!
Let's scare the fear out of him.

226
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,081
Just like in rehearsal.
Places, everyone. And action!

227
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,250
False alarm. It wasn't my mom.
It was just gas.

228
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,285
- What's that?
- I'm sorry.

229
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,968
That was my stomach. Without Bobbie
to feed me, I'm so very hungry.

230
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,403
See? Nothing to worry about.
It's just Mr. Weenie starving.

231
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,882
- I'm pretty scared here!
- I wouldn't exactly call you "pretty."

232
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,570
This place gives me the creeps!

233
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,122
Ruggedly handsome, maybe,
but definitely not pretty.

234
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:09,243
What's that? A vampire bat!
An extinct Tyrannosaurus Rex!

235
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,688
Such teeny arms,
how does he comb his hair?

236
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,161
That's the scariest thing I've ever seen!

237
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,251
Let's get out of here!

238
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:24,930
No, Boog, face your fear. You look it
in the eye and say, "I'm a grizzly bear!"

239
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,321
- And then you roar!
- Roar?

240
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:34,443
A spider! The Eiffel Tower! A cow.
A chicken. Bunny and doggie.

241
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,286
Sailor's knot. Oh, bad idea.

242
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,401
Your roar worked. The shadows
are gone. Now's our chance. Hurry!

243
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,881
You did it, Boog. You faced your fear.

244
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,646
You can face anything now,
including a werewolf.

245
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,241
- Now can we go on that camping trip?
- No way!

246
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,880
I just added more to
my list of things that scare me.

247
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,089
Evil rock shadows and zombie skeletons!

248
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,364
Achtung, baby!

249
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,689
- I'm out of here!
- Hold on. Be brave. We can beat it.

250
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,161
But how can we beat something
that's already dead?

251
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,045
Face your fear with your face!
And your eyeballs!

252
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,041
Elliot wanted us to move like a skeleton.

253
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,208
I'm doing the skeleton dance.

254
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,091
Skeletons don't shake their hips
like they're trying to get a date.

255
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,766
Like you know
anything about getting a date.

256
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,801
- Why you gotta be like that?
- Well, this stinks.

257
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,924
What did I tell you? We beat it!
Still scared?

258
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,127
More than ever.

259
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:33,410
If something happens to me, I want you
to have my adorable sweaters.

260
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:37,201
- Oh, come on. Chin up, guys!
- We don't have chins.

261
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,647
- Sure we do. Right here.
- That's a muzzle.

262
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,883
- It's a chin. See how I rub it.
- Mine is a snout.

263
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,731
Forget the chins.
We've got courage and strength.

264
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,884
If the werewolf himself appeared,
you'd scare him away too.

265
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,805
- Wanna bet?
- Great idea. I'll summon the werewolf.

266
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,201
- No, no, no.
- If I win the bet, we go camping.

267
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,886
- If I win the bet, we get eaten!
- Deal.

268
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,086
Do you have to tinkle?

269
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,210
I'm performing the Wailing
Wampus Werewolf dance.

270
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:08,524
Wampus Wailing Walla Walla
Wampus Wailing Chimi Changa

271
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,808
Wampus Wailing Walla Walla

272
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,325
That's my cue.

273
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,528
Yeah, I don't think you should do this.

274
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,564
You don't think I've got the chops
to scare that bear?

275
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,162
You don't even look like a monster.
You look like a deer covered in moss.

276
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,129
It's all about the performance.

277
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,888
Trust me, Boog will be so petrified
he'll forget he's scared.

278
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:31,761
- Wolfie, wolfie. Where's wolfie?
- I don't want any part of this.

279
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:36,209
Your loss. Time for the maestro
to work his magic.

280
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,651
It's working!

281
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,802
Wampus Wailing...

282
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:54,329
I can't see! Give me something soft.

283
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,730
Buddy.

284
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,803
Mr. Weenie, please tell me
that was your stomach.

285
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,487
That was not my stomach,
but I am still starving.

286
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,603
You wouldn't happen to have
a burrito on you?

287
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,091
Quiet. It's here.

288
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:14,168
Wait a minute. That's not Ian.
That's the real werewolf. Run!

289
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,446
That's gonna leave a mark.

290
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,084
What in the name
of Uncle Sam's striped pajamas?

291
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,769
- It's the werewolf!
- It's not a legend. Give me my gun!

292
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:57,442
The Wailing Wampus Werewolf.
It's real. It's real.

293
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:05,411
The Wailing Wampus Werewolf! It's real!
It's real! That was amazing!

294
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:09,963
No, it wasn't. I thought I was gonna die.
I'm hyper-ventilating.

295
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,043
Anybody got a paper bag
I can breathe into?

296
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,567
Perhaps one of my scented doodie bags
will do?

297
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,962
- No thank you.
- At least we're safe!

298
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,647
Hey, what's a car doing
on this paved deer trail?

299
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,451
I just thought of something.
Excuse me one moment.

300
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,880
I need a word with Mr. Weenie.

301
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,168
We faked the werewolf, but it's real!

302
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,041
If Boog can overcome his fear of a real
werewolf, he's sure to be brave...

303
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,521
enough to go on
that special camping trip with me!

304
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,047
It's not fake! It's not fake!

305
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,208
- What's not fake?
- The werewolf!

306
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,967
- You mean it was fake before?
- No. It wasn't fake before.

307
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,403
But now it's really not fake!
We'd better hurry.

308
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,370
We've got an appointment with some
Woo-Hoo bars in Timberline!

309
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,809
Isn't it great how near-death experiences
make you feel so alive?

310
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:02,045
Maybe I would appreciate near death
more if I wasn't so hungry.

311
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:06,728
Look at us. Walking around, not dead.
High five. Or high three in my case.

312
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,722
How could you put me in danger like that?

313
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,928
You're supposed to be my best friend.

314
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:17,047
Best friend?
You've never said that out loud.

315
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,851
Hold on, I've got something in my eye.

316
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,808
I promised myself I wouldn't cry...

317
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,522
False alarm: it's just sweat.

318
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,802
Now that we're officially best friends,
we should have our own theme song!

319
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,207
- Elliot and Boog.
- And Mr. Weenie!

320
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,522
Elliot and Boog and Mister Weenie

321
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,921
The bestest friends You've ever seen-ie

322
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,481
Oh, Elliot is smart And Boog is all heart

323
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,881
And Weenie's legs are so very teeny

324
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:47,487
I've gotta be honest,
the Mr. Weenie part feels a little forced.

325
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,281
Boog, if I may be so bold, perhaps
I could be your new best friend.

326
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,802
Of course this means you would
have to feed me. And rub my belly.

327
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,930
- What is your stance on neutering?
- You or me?

328
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,411
- It's Shaw.
- On the deer trail!

329
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,688
Just when this day couldn't get any worse.

330
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:16,208
He can't do anything to us.
It's against the law now, remember?

331
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:27,365
Laugh it up, tick magnet.
I'll be seeing you. Real soon.

332
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:39,924
- That went well.
- Nah, Shaw's up to something.

333
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,525
We better find out what.

334
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:52,171
Okay! The meeting is called to order.
Marcia, you have an announcement?

335
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,243
Thank you, Sheriff Gordy.

336
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,802
We're having a bake sale to raise money
to repaint the school bus.

337
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,323
Make it stop!

338
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:10,323
Y'all know me.
You know how I earn a living.

339
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,369
Yeah, you're the tour guide.

340
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:16,042
Before that I was a hunter.
Best there ever was.

341
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,124
And now there's something
in them woods that needs hunting.

342
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,011
Spotted it just outside of
Dead Bear Gulch.

343
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:28,725
It was none other than
the Wailing Wampus Werewolf.

344
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,451
There's no such thing as werewolves.

345
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,204
Settle down, everybody.

346
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,887
I'll catch this beast for you,
but it ain't gonna be easy.

347
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,889
He doesn't even have any evidence.

348
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,287
You mean besides this massive head wound?

349
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:46,369
Oh, I've got evidence.
Everybody here is in danger.

350
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,807
- Why are you on top?
- Because I'm taller.

351
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,009
- Makes sense.
- Keep still.

352
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,361
What are they saying?

353
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:58,367
I don't know. I can't read lips. Or books.
Or anything really. I'm a bear.

354
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,202
I'm going in.

355
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:06,164
As soon as I get out from
under your butt area. Please.

356
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:10,724
...anything like this.
You wanted evidence. Behold.

357
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,809
But it's so small!

358
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:20,249
You moron. This isn't life size.
This thing is huge!

359
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:28,007
This monster has got fury in its eye
and hunger in its belly.

360
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,249
Belly hunger?
That's the worst kind of hunger!

361
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,210
Hold still, will you?

362
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:40,161
Oh, my apologies. I'm so weak from
the hunger I could eat this rope.

363
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,407
Delicious rope.

364
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,171
I don't see
anything conclusive here, Shaw.

365
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:52,729
Thought you might not, sheriff,
which is why I drew a detailed sketch.

366
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,489
I was skeptical of werewolves
until I saw the drawing.

367
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,131
Dude can draw!

368
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,523
The end of the rope
is the most delicious part!

369
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,165
Mr. Weenie! Bad dog!

370
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:12,486
The werewolf wants to destroy you,
your family, your way of life.

371
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,323
This is the worst PTA meeting ever.

372
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,487
This rope is good!

373
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,570
Although, it could use some salt.

374
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,200
Hey! Let go!

375
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,202
You've gotta let me go out there
armed to catch this thing.

376
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,371
- You mean you want me to...
- Reopen open season.

377
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,689
Open season?

378
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,641
The werewolf!

379
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,328
Mr. Weenie! Drop it! Sit. Stay. Heel!

380
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,691
Werewolf footprints.

381
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,842
The werewolf's been eavesdropping.

382
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,646
Sheriff, you know what you have to do.

383
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:10,084
Better safe than
ripped to sorry shreds by a werewolf.

384
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,050
Come on, Sheriff Gordy!

385
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:16,642
Reopen open season and let
the tour guide hunt down the werewolf!

386
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,763
Okay. Open season is reopened.

387
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,082
You've made the right decision.

388
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:28,809
Gordy, what are you doing?
Oh, no! Open season?

389
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,086
Shaw. Only the werewolf. You're not
to touch anything else in that forest.

390
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,722
Sure thing, sheriff.
I will only shoot the werewolf.

391
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,643
And anything that
gets in between me and the werewolf...

392
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,644
like, say, a bear or a deer.

393
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,005
We gotta warn the others!

394
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,642
I guess things can get worse.
Now Shaw is after us.

395
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:02,521
While Shaw did not specifically mention
coming after Mr. Weenie...

396
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:06,446
I stand with you.
I've got nowhere else to go!

397
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,287
Hey, wait up for Mr. Weenie!

398
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,128
Deer tick! I think I got a deer tick.

399
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,681
You can never be too careful these days...

400
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,282
what with Lyme disease
and everything. No, guess I'm clean.

401
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,487
You know, I've been thinking.

402
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:25,007
I've been talking about the werewolf
and suddenly it's everywhere.

403
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,808
What if...? Pine trees,
pine trees, pine trees.

404
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,166
No way! I say it and I see it. Rocks.

405
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:41,921
I shall call this power The See-cret
and use it responsibly.

406
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:45,567
Focus. We got a Shaw problem,
and a werewolf problem.

407
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,166
So we've only got two problems.
Piece of cake!

408
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,321
I like cake!

409
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,767
But both these two problems can kill us!

410
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,531
If you could stop the werewolf
and stop open season...

411
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,206
I'd gladly go on
that special camping trip with you!

412
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,203
- Yes!
- But you can't!

413
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,442
- No.
- Maybe we should build that panic room...

414
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,921
where hunters and werewolves can't get in.

415
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,889
Somewhere we can both safely hide.

416
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:09,601
Don't forget about Mr. Weenie.
I too would like to safely hide.

417
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,809
We're not hiding. We're gonna
catch this werewolf ourselves.

418
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,325
That's too dangerous.

419
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,130
Everyone is counting on us, Boog.

420
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,926
We've gotta take care of the werewolf
to get rid of Shaw.

421
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,889
What do you mean "we"?

422
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,362
- Have I ever let anything happen to you?
- Yes.

423
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:29,048
Okay, so our adventures are messy,
they're unpredictable, wild.

424
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,248
But we usually survive. Don't we?

425
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,606
We do.

426
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,730
I won't let anything happen to you
this time and that's a promise.

427
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,769
- Why?
- Why?

428
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:41,925
Because friends are always there
for each other. Now repeat after me.

429
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:48,008
"I'm Boog and I'm a brave bear."

430
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,208
- Are you with me?
- I'm with you.

431
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,328
- Me too!
- Excellent.

432
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:55,569
Now let's get back and warn the others
about Shaw and the werewolf!

433
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:29,291
Sweetheart. Daddy's home.
Wakey, wakey. Time to get up.

434
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,964
Hello, Lorraine.

435
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,161
I know you've been holed up here too long.

436
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,328
Probably going half out of your mind.

437
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,731
But your interminable wait
is finally commencing to be over.

438
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:49,205
You and me are going out!
Open season is back on, babycakes!

439
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,489
We're painting the town red!

440
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:59,364
Come on down to Ed and Edna's
Poutine Palace!

441
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:04,481
Home of the Big Curd.
Hey, Ed. What's poutine?

442
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:08,127
Funny you should ask, Edna.
First, you take french fries...

443
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:12,881
dump boiling gravy on them. Boiling gravy!

444
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:16,601
Then plop in some curds,
and viola! Poutine.

445
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,201
With one convenient location!

446
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:22,165
Right on Highway 7, next to the big tree.

447
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,921
- Plenty of free parking!
- So come on down.

448
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,560
Or up, depending on
where you start from, eh?

449
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:34,285
To Ed and Edna's Poutine Palace
Curds fit for a king

450
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,090
Or a queen!

451
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,050
Nice commercial, Ed!

452
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,568
Now, if that don't get them
busting down our door, nothing will.

453
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,765
- That was fast!
- The power of advertising!

454
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,888
Howdy, Ed and Edna!

455
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,883
Oh, Shaw. Good day, eh?

456
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:57,567
Hey, you haven't lived till you've tried
our poutine on the ritz.

457
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,803
Save your curds.
We're getting the band back together.

458
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,367
No way, eh. You're in a band?

459
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,841
I can play a mean accordion
if you're interested.

460
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,241
Open season is open again.

461
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,847
We've got a monster to hunt.
And whatever else gets in our way.

462
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,006
Oh, boy, I've been
waiting for this moment, don't you know?

463
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,401
Hey, Ian! Didn't see you out in Dead Bear
Gulch in your werewolf disguise.

464
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,131
Stage fright, right? You should
do what I do and imagine...

465
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,930
the audience are all in their underwear.

466
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,084
I guess it didn't matter anyway
since the real werewolf showed up!

467
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,366
Hello, everybody. We got some news.

468
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,528
Slow down, Boog. Let me handle this.

469
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,889
We've got some news.
I've got bad news and bad news.

470
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,166
What do you want to hear first?

471
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,089
The bad news?

472
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,930
- Tell them!
- I was pausing for dramatic effect.

473
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:54,005
- Open season is open again.
- Shaw is back in action.

474
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,485
What's the bad news?

475
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,326
There really is a Wailing
Wampus Werewolf in our wilderness.

476
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:09,520
There's no werewolf. That's just
a big fat lie you told to try to scare us.

477
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,927
He's the fat one. But here's my proof.

478
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,368
Check out Shaw's detailed masterpiece.

479
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,808
That thing looks horrible!

480
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,281
Shaw is a rather gifted artist,
I must say.

481
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,962
- Is there any good news?
- Yes. I'm on the case.

482
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:29,086
He asked if there was good news,
not the worst news ever.

483
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:34,682
Another mess caused by
you and your bonky interpretive dances.

484
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,922
When have my dances ever caused a problem?

485
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,645
Lightning dance!

486
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,810
Mud slide dance!

487
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,330
Avalanche dance!

488
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,050
You have to stop dancing.

489
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,726
Especially the ones
named after natural disasters.

490
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,451
This is all your fault, Smelliot.

491
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,007
Did you hear that?
I just called him "Smelliot."

492
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,242
Don't worry, guys. I'll make things right.

493
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,967
Once I dramatically capture the werewolf,
slap him around a little bit...

494
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:09,364
and heroically ride him into town,
open season will be closed again.

495
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:12,729
And exactly how are you
gonna capture the werewolf?

496
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,680
With a clever monster corralling
interpretive dance, of course, duh!

497
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,171
- Aye...
- Well..

498
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:21,603
I'm not so sure about
Elliot's dancing abilities and I'm not...

499
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,321
convinced there is a werewolf
but I do know Shaw's guns are real.

500
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,164
Elliot may be our only hope.

501
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,085
If Elliot's our only hope, we're doomed!

502
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,040
Hold up, everyone. It's true
that Shaw and his gun are on the loose.

503
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,204
And until the werewolf is dealt with,
we're all at risk.

504
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,125
But if Elliot says he can capture it,
I believe him.

505
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,123
He's the best deer for the job.

506
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:45,648
- Thanks for standing up for me.
- Friends don't abandon friends.

507
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,723
What makes Elliot so qualified?

508
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:53,527
I'm a master werewolf hunter-slash-
tracker-slash-expert-slash-whisperer.

509
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,728
- That's three slashes.
- Aye.

510
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:59,009
I'm coming with you. To make sure
you don't bust any more moves.

511
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,762
Fine. The rest of you, stay alert.
If you see something, say something.

512
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,088
Something.

513
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,446
Where to first?

514
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:12,561
In order to track the werewolf, we need to
start at the first place it appeared.

515
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:15,411
I know! At the RV!

516
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:20,043
That's where Bob and or Bobbie
were eaten by the werewolf!

517
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,849
Obviously none of you have ever been on
a Wailing Wampus Werewolf...

518
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,800
investigation, so follow my lead.
Don't touch the evidence...

519
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,641
don't contaminate the crime scene,
and do not under any circumstances...

520
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,167
pee on anything. Boog.

521
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:55,364
- You're disgusting.
- Let's go!

522
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,761
Elliot, what do we do
once we find the werewolf?

523
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,809
Is there a special dance or something?

524
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,965
We face the threat the same way
we face headlights: Head on!

525
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,170
That is a terrible analogy.

526
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,683
I have no idea what you just said,
Giselle, but touché.

527
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:21,849
Movies! Two words! Lethal Weapon 2.

528
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:26,640
The door is locked. Need Mr. Weenie
to go in through the doggy door.

529
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,168
- I was way off.
- Why didn't you just say that?

530
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,287
Welcome to the scene of the crime.

531
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:43,122
Blasted fly zapper's on the fritz again.
You may enter.

532
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:48,446
But I must warn you, what you are
about to see, can't be unseen.

533
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:53,891
It is a tableau of unfathomable depravity.
Come on in.

534
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:58,890
The wiener dog is right. No offense,
Boog, but it might be grisly.

535
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,407
- You're weird, Elliot.
- Weird like a fox.

536
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:05,531
The horror! The food bowl is empty.

537
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,407
Actually, this is a nice crib.

538
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:15,365
It's spotless. No signs of a struggle.

539
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:19,724
Obviously the werewolf attacked Bobbie
and Bob, then cleaned the RV.

540
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,723
He wants us to think he wasn't here.

541
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,963
The Wailing Wampus Werewolf
is notoriously tidy.

542
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,641
So you're saying the werewolf
cleaned the dishes?

543
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,610
Classic werewolf move.

544
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,846
I think this is equipment
for tracking a monster.

545
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,525
Boog, you're new at this.

546
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:42,207
What we could really use right now
is equipment to track the monster.

547
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,601
You mean like this?

548
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:47,207
Monster tracking equipment,
monster tracking equipment.

549
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:53,322
The power of The See-cret.
Still not used to it.

550
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,364
You know how any of this stuff works?

551
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:00,845
I'll use my instincts. Part of being
an animal. We'll need this face helmet!

552
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:05,205
- He's not gonna turn that thing on, is he?
- Probably.

553
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,010
We're not taking the face helmet.

554
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,164
Well, that was a bust.

555
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:25,687
Even though this werewolf is a neat freak,
he could have left a clue somewhere.

556
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,521
Like this one. Bone voyage!

557
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:35,561
The werewolf has eaten poor Bobbie,
or maybe Bob! That's all that is left.

558
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:41,401
I'm so sad. But so hungry.

559
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,970
But so sad.

560
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,331
Why does it smell like
11 herbs and spices?

561
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,211
The smell of pure evil.

562
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,322
No. It really smells more like
11 herbs and spices.

563
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:03,520
I understand how you "laymen"
are having a hard time following my logic.

564
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:09,004
With this "monster tracking equipment,"
we'll be able to...

565
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,363
cleverly track down the whereabouts
of our alleged perpetrator...

566
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,807
i.e., for example, said werewolf.

567
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,207
- Oh, goodie.
- Someone is coming.

568
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,486
Quick, blend in.

569
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,486
I'm a cow!

570
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,682
Bobbie and or Bob, I shall avenge thee!

571
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:43,931
Mr. Weenie? I brought you
some Weiner Chow.

572
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:48,768
They're shaped like little wiener dogs.
Where could he be?

573
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,729
Okay, Ed and Edna. Let's put this thing
in cruise control...

574
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:59,487
so we can go over my big plan
to track down this monster.

575
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,881
- Big plan?
- Should we be taking notes?

576
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,849
Just listen, dingdongs.

577
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,927
Good old Sheriff Gordy has given us
carte blanch to blast away!

578
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,048
Now who's this here "Carte Blanch"?

579
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,044
I think it's a kind of animal,
related to the penguin, eh.

580
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:17,921
We get to shoot a real live werewolf!

581
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:23,247
And by "werewolf," do you mean
one of them abominable snowmen?

582
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,887
- No!
- A chupacabra?

583
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,451
- No!
- Vampire?

584
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,807
A werewolf, you morons!

585
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:36,649
A 10-foot tall, drooling, blasphemous
scourge that needs to be eradicated!

586
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,128
Traffic these days!

587
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:46,410
Now here's the fun part:
While we are hunting to extinction...

588
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,564
this unholy denizen
from the very bowels of Hades...

589
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:54,971
we can take out a certain bear and deer,
if you get my drift!

590
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:04,880
My gut tells me that we'll find
our werewolf in Dead Bear Gulch.

591
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:09,489
This is gonna be easy! The werewolf
is right there next to that "X".

592
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:12,849
That's why I love you, Edna.
You're good at reading maps!

593
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,370
Imbeciles.

594
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:26,568
There's certain werewolf behavior
that will clearly give away its location.

595
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:29,445
Are you talking about where it eats?
Where it sleeps?

596
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:33,286
- Where it poos.
- What does poo have to do with this?

597
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,329
It's our key to finding the werewolf.

598
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:38,165
Its poo is like bread crumbs.
But way different.

599
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,731
I'm not looking for poo.

600
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:43,487
You don't have to.
I've got this trusty werewolf-poo finder.

601
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:47,087
Yeah. I'm pretty sure
that isn't a werewolf poo-finder.

602
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,887
You were saying?

603
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,283
We've struck the mother lode.

604
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:58,531
Isn't that kind of small
for werewolf poop?

605
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:01,047
Werewolves are notoriously small poopers.

606
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,929
That reminds me of Bobbie.

607
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:06,801
Who will save my precious doodoo
in a little plastic baggie now?

608
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,883
- Don't look at me.
- You can learn a lot...

609
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,280
about a monster from its poo.

610
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:13,683
- It's the window to the soul.
- The eyes are the window to the soul.

611
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:20,246
Not for a werewolf. It's poo.
It's always poo. We've got to analyze this.

612
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,160
He's touching it!

613
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,966
Elliot, what exactly
do you mean by "analyze"?

614
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:32,249
It means I must become one with the poo.

615
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,442
This dropped fifty-seven... Wait.

616
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,843
- Fifty-six minutes ago.
- He's good.

617
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:43,931
That's strange. I hear the ocean.
Funny how that happens every time.

618
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,003
How many times do you do this?

619
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,128
Enough times to know
there's only one way left...

620
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,567
to truly know the werewolf's whereabouts.

621
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,965
No. No, no, no.

622
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,282
What are you...? No!

623
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:02,245
He's heading north. Seventh of eight kids.

624
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,246
Left-handed, but bats righty.
Swimmer's build.

625
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:12,891
Likes long walks in the moonlight.
I can taste it. And also... Pistachios?

626
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,930
What in the bazookie are you doing?

627
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:19,163
A field fecal study of
the Wailing Wampus Werewolf.

628
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:22,722
That is mine. This is my spot.

629
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,009
So that's not monster poo?
That's your poo?

630
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,241
Aye!

631
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,640
Just to be clear...

632
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:32,287
you're saying the poo that's in
Elliot's mouth right now is your poo.

633
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:35,569
I'd recognize those pistachios anywhere.

634
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:45,805
Code brown! Code brown! Friend's poo!
I just ate a friend's poo!

635
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:50,170
We're not friends.
Friends don't eat friends' poo.

636
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:56,367
Water, water, water! Need water now!

637
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,010
The lake is right over there.

638
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:09,367
Only a monster
would leave something like this behind.

639
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:12,842
- The werewolf, eh?
- I'll check.

640
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,084
It's moving north.

641
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:21,086
- Oh, yeah, you're good.
- We could use Jolene's help.

642
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:24,961
I got her down by the lake.
Let's go pay her a visit.

643
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,651
Don't leave now,
I was about to bring out dessert!

644
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:42,163
Stop looking at my tushy.
I can still taste the shame.

645
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:47,201
Elliot and Boog and Mr. Weenie
The bestest friends you ever seen-ie

646
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,806
Not exactly a theme song moment,
Mr. Weenie.

647
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,402
Timber! Rookies.

648
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,045
Hey! What happened to him?

649
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:59,283
- He accidentally ate McSquizzy's poo.
- Yeah, who hasn't?

650
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:02,523
Despite this one minor setback,
I am not giving up.

651
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:03,767
So let's recap.

652
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:06,167
- You didn't find any clues at the RV?
- Check.

653
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,243
And McSquizzy's poo
didn't give us any clues?

654
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,926
- Check.
- So we don't have any clues.

655
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:13,811
Exactly! That's how I know
we're getting closer.

656
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,007
I'm confused.

657
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:18,687
The werewolf isn't leaving behind any
clues because he knows I'm onto him.

658
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:21,411
He's clearly trying to outsmart me.

659
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:24,086
- Not that hard to do.
- Thank you, Giselle.

660
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,322
Shaw.

661
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:31,810
We won't hurt you, porcupine.
We just want to ask you a few questions.

662
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,607
Oh, man. Shaw's never gonna stop
until he gets us all.

663
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:38,007
We gotta find and capture
that werewolf fast so they...

664
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,525
can call off open season.

665
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:42,451
We could find him if we could just
see the forest from above.

666
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,404
If only we had a sea plane.

667
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:50,723
I am mastering The See-cret.
All we need now is a pilot.

668
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,644
Serge, can you fly?

669
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,201
- But of course.
- Right this way, please.

670
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,730
- Someone's jacking my plane!
- Who's Jack?

671
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:07,883
My seat belt won't go all the way.

672
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,287
Elliot, are you sure
you know what you're doing?

673
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:15,082
Yep, I can hotwire this thing.
Now do I cut the blue wire or the red wire?

674
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:20,044
Yep. It's the red wire.

675
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,247
Jolene!

676
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:23,684
They're coming!

677
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,771
My horn's stuck!

678
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:31,082
Lookie! A werewolf pilot!

679
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,724
The werewolf? Duck!

680
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,443
- Jolene.
- Jolene.

681
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:43,046
Jolene!

682
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:49,922
We did it! Shaw!
See you, wouldn't want to be you.

683
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,886
Now, everyone keep your eyes peeled
for the werewolf.

684
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:56,129
But don't literally peel them
because that would be gross.

685
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:00,051
Oh, stewardess!
Would you mind asking the bunnies...

686
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:04,489
not to recline so far back
into my personal space?

687
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:08,007
- Nuts?
- Got any wood?

688
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:14,370
- Okay, Serge, take over.
- Take over?

689
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:17,689
- Yeah! You said you could fly.
- My apologies.

690
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:21,686
There has been a misunderstanding.
We can fly, just not a plane!

691
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:25,763
Our pilots have left the plane.
This is bad, no?

692
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,685
I just discovered a new fear. Heights!

693
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:32,886
Jolene!

694
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,529
Are you afraid of plane crashes?

695
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,523
I've always had a fear of plane crashes.

696
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:41,729
But I thought being in one
was impossible since I'm a bear.

697
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,605
Nothing is impossible
if you believe in yourself.

698
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:49,169
Relax, everyone. Statistically,
flying is still the safest way to travel.

699
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:50,446
If you got a pilot.

700
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:53,644
It'll be fine. Quick question.
Is there a pilot on board?

701
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,848
Okay, is there a taxidermist on board?

702
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:08,044
Oh, no! Since it appears this is the end,
I feel it's only right to confess.

703
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,766
I'm not really German, I am Swiss!

704
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:14,367
You're Swiss? Well, hola!

705
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,727
Hey! We can use this
to float to the ground.

706
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,361
Nice, Giselle.

707
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:21,445
We're saved!

708
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:31,920
Do whatever you're supposed to do
in the event of an emergency landing!

709
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:36,163
- Excellent!
- Maybe there's parachutes in the back.

710
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:42,130
Boog, you're flying
by the seat of your pants!

711
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:51,444
- You're a crack pilot!
- Is this what they call a bum steer?

712
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,126
Boog, your butt saved ours!

713
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,770
Hey, what'd I miss?

714
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,202
Now it's personal.

715
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:15,806
How did a werewolf get a pilot's license?

716
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:17,962
It's got the intelligence of a man.

717
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:20,566
Yeah, but you'd think
when it applied for a license...

718
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,051
somebody would have said something.

719
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:25,761
Maybe it dressed up like a man
when it went into the office.

720
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,001
Shut your curd-holes!

721
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:30,642
To catch the monster,
we've got to think like the monster.

722
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,211
You mean think like a man?

723
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:34,362
You said it's got
the intelligence of a man.

724
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:37,163
What would a man do?

725
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,330
Morons.

726
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:45,161
Come on, guys! We're not gonna
let a little thing like a "plane crash"...

727
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:49,325
crush our spirits. We got us
a werewolf to catch! Who's with me?

728
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,208
Crickets. Crickets. Crickets.

729
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:56,440
Fine. But if you ask me, we got the
werewolf right where we want him.

730
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:00,481
Elliot, maybe we ought to take a break
from all this werewolf stuff.

731
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:03,530
- Restrategize.
- Sorry, I don't parlez vous French.

732
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:07,207
Look, we just survived a plane crash.
Maybe we should quit while...

733
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:10,961
we're ahead and, I don't know,
build ourselves that panic room?

734
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:13,885
There's plenty of wood.
We could build one ASAP.

735
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:16,771
Could you build me a little tiny house
with my name on it that...

736
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:19,002
- we could keep in the panic room?
- Sure thing.

737
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:21,731
- I am in.
- Me too.

738
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:25,248
You tried your best, Elliot,
but maybe you're in over your head.

739
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:28,882
Guys, guys, guys. And, Giselle. And, Ian.

740
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:32,681
We're fighting for our forest!
Remember, if we don't get rid of...

741
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:37,050
the werewolf, open season stays open.
And we're not quitters!

742
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,204
Did the Romans quit when the Vikings
landed at Plymouth Rock?

743
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:43,921
Did the mighty dodo bird
give up when it went extinct?

744
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:47,607
Did the Titanic call it quits
when it hit the ice cream truck?

745
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,444
Nope, nope, and nope.

746
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:53,889
Sure, the werewolf has fangs,
Shaw has guns.

747
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:59,365
But you know the one thing we've got
that nobody else has? Boog's butt!

748
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,204
Where are you going with this, Elliot?

749
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:02,964
- It's an amalgagee.
- Analogy.

750
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:05,930
That too. The point is,
when the chips were down...

751
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:08,765
the odds were against us,
and the pilots had left the building...

752
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:11,088
We will never live this down.

753
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:14,529
Boog's butt saved the day.
There's always gonna be something...

754
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:17,769
that comes through for us.
Because that's how we roll.

755
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:21,129
Boog's butt! Boog's butt! Boog's butt!

756
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:22,327
Boog's butt!

757
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:24,568
I'm starting to feel
a little self-conscious.

758
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,209
Great speech, but I vote
we build that panic room and hide.

759
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,765
You can count us in.

760
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:33,651
Panic room, panic room, panic room!

761
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:38,804
All of this talk about butts and panic rooms
is making me hungry, again.

762
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,291
I'm gonna search for some food.

763
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:43,244
Okay, we got rid of our dead weight.

764
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:46,643
Still with me, Boog? You know
I can't do this without my BFF.

765
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:51,089
That's Bear Friend Forever, FYI.
For your information. LOL.

766
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:52,207
Still with you.

767
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:55,011
You know, maybe we've been
going about this the wrong way.

768
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:58,323
- Maybe?
- Instead of going after the werewolf...

769
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,960
maybe we should lure the werewolf to us.

770
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:02,406
What do you have in mind?

771
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:07,003
Boog, you look like
a size 12... hundred. Petite.

772
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:08,446
Why?

773
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:14,166
- Boog, we're waiting.
- I don't feel comfortable coming out.

774
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:15,930
I'm sure you look fine.

775
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:30,206
This is ridiculous.

776
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:34,484
- You're surprisingly cute.
- More importantly...

777
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:38,690
you look exactly like a female Wailing
Wampus Werewolf. Give us a spin.

778
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,728
I'm not sure I can pull this off.

779
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:45,882
Let's rehearse. I'll pretend to be male.

780
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:49,602
- Don't strain yourself.
- Boog, make me attracted to you.

781
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:53,731
Hi, I'm Boog... I mean, Boogette.

782
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:57,965
Cut! That is not how you seduce
a Wailing Wampus Werewolf.

783
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:01,681
Okay. Although, I'm pretty sure
there isn't a real werewolf...

784
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:05,322
if you're gonna do this, let me help.
Now, Boog, play it cool.

785
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:08,086
Make eye contact, but don't stare.

786
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:14,088
Be mysterious, but not super scary.
And most importantly, smile.

787
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,284
Better. Much better.

788
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:22,171
Giselle, obviously you know nothing
about being a woman.

789
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:25,642
It's all about the body language.
You've gotta have the right walk...

790
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:28,724
the right pose,
and the right eyelash flutter.

791
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:34,041
This is dumb. It'll never work.
Walk. Pose.

792
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:39,809
Well, hello there, miss.
Never seen you around these parts.

793
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:44,204
You know, me and some friends
are building a romantic panic room...

794
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:47,364
if you care to join me... I mean us.

795
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:50,763
Ian. It's me. Boog. I'm not a lady.

796
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,885
Oh, yeah. Call me.

797
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:56,891
"It'll never work."

798
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:04,642
I am so very hungry,
I could drink a horse.

799
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:10,006
Food! At long last!

800
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:16,166
I'm never gonna be
the girl you want me to be.

801
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:18,203
Come on! We can make this work!

802
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,721
Why can't you just accept me for who I am?

803
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,486
Guys? This is getting
a little too intense.

804
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:27,850
Instead of disguising me as bait,
why not use The See-cret?

805
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:30,441
- Say it and you see it.
- I know!

806
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:33,171
I'll use The See-cret! Genius!

807
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:36,529
Wailing Wampus Werewolf,
Wailing Wampus Werewolf!

808
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:43,043
Hey, guys! I have satisfied my hunger.
For now.

809
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:50,288
Let's huddle! Oh, man!
Mr. Weenie's the werewolf!

810
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:54,764
A wiener dog werewolf! Of course!
A textbook "wereweenie."

811
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:58,766
Okay, break!
How could I have missed the signs!

812
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:02,561
I'm sure there is a reasonable explanation
for what is on his face.

813
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:05,530
Yes. And that explanation is: it's blood.

814
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:07,728
Because Weenie is a bloodthirsty werewolf.

815
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:14,324
Think about it, Giselle. You never see
Mr. Weenie and the werewolf together.

816
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:16,642
You never see the werewolf
and anyone together.

817
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,962
In that case,
any one of us could be the werewolf.

818
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:22,643
She's right. Boog, are you the werewolf?

819
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:24,490
- No!
- Giselle?

820
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:27,007
- Yes, I am.
- I knew it!

821
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:29,083
No, Elliot, I am not the werewolf.

822
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:33,609
I knew that too. I was just testing you.
You passed. Barely.

823
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:36,809
If we really want to make sure that
Mr. Weenie is the werewolf...

824
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,928
we need to observe him
without him knowing.

825
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:42,448
Like a stakeout? I love how I think.

826
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:44,762
Tonight we complete our investigation.

827
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:48,811
You boys have fun. I'm gonna find
a cool dry place and call it a night.

828
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:56,365
Hey, Mr. Weenie. We need you to
guard this log.

829
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,121
Mr. Weenie is on duty!

830
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:11,804
The full moon is even fuller than
last night's full moon.

831
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:15,601
If Mr. Weenie is gonna transform into
the werewolf, tonight's the night.

832
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:18,969
We've got to stay awake. No matter what.

833
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:20,963
No problem. I can stay awake.

834
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:23,726
Elliot.

835
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:29,320
Oh, Boog, I had the most wonderful
dream! Me and you were dolphins.

836
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:32,848
I was a regular dolphin and you were
kind of a fat dolphin and we were...

837
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:35,805
camping in the woods.
Without a fear in the world!

838
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,527
Although we were getting dried out
with pine needles sticking to our fins.

839
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:42,206
You were asleep two seconds
and you dreamed all that?

840
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:46,649
Then this beautiful seahorse appeared
and we rode off into the sunset.

841
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:48,251
What does that even mean?

842
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:51,085
I think it means we're friends,
even if we're fish.

843
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:52,651
Of course you're my friend.

844
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:56,403
Okay! I know this is your first stakeout,
so don't hesitate...

845
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:58,568
to ask me any questions. For instance...

846
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:03,647
this is a werewolf-transformation cam!
It will capture any transformation...

847
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:06,326
the wiener dog makes.
But we must stay alert.

848
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:08,528
- Got it.
- Be ready for anything.

849
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:13,447
- I'm ready.
- Eyeballs must be open at all times.

850
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:21,161
Hey, guys! Guys. Mr. Weenie is gone.

851
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,644
Let's check the transformation cam!

852
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:34,090
- He's sleeping.
- A clever werewolf ploy.

853
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,288
Or he's a sleeping wiener dog.

854
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:42,090
Obviously he's having a werewolf
dream of chasing...

855
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:45,801
down and ripping apart
a helpless victim. Pretty standard stuff.

856
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,641
- Another werewolf move?
- No.

857
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:52,690
It's just a wiener dog
scratching his back. Come on!

858
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:58,529
That's the traditional
werewolf interpretive dance...

859
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:01,490
done to summon other werewolves.
So graceful.

860
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:05,247
It's settled, then.
Mr. Weenie is the werewolf.

861
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:09,883
So I am the werewolf? I'm always
the last to hear about these things.

862
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:15,486
So that would mean I ate Bobbie!
And Bob. I must leave this place...

863
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:19,480
before I eat my friends too.
I mean, think of all the calories!

864
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:23,808
If he is the werewolf, why didn't he
attack you guys in your sleep?

865
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:27,248
- Good point.
- For once, Giselle, you're right.

866
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:30,330
Mr. Weenie couldn't be the werewolf.
Well, no harm done.

867
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:35,209
Shoot that ugly female werewolf!

868
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:37,089
What... Who's he calling ugly?

869
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:42,489
- It's in cahoots with the deer.
- What is this world coming to?

870
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:53,803
Let's stop and talk this over,
you dirty rotten animals!

871
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:55,928
We just want to be your friend!

872
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:01,651
- What's these guys' deal, anyway?
- Yeah. What do they have against us?

873
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:07,521
Careful there, Shaw.

874
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:10,126
We got a pot full of poutine
simmering in there.

875
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:22,645
Well, we'll have to change
our commercial, Ed.

876
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:25,041
Yeah. We're not by the big tree no more.

877
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,565
Come on, Canucks! Let's go!

878
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:40,724
- The old lava mine?
- Who mines for lava?

879
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:43,285
It's that or the hunters.

880
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:54,370
How are we gonna get in?

881
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:56,522
Guys? How about we use the door?

882
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:13,769
Do you hear something?

883
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:18,811
It was just a bunch of vampire bats
that feed off the blood...

884
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:21,645
of living creatures. Everything's cool.

885
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:33,003
Let's hide in one of those!

886
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:34,361
I lost them.

887
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:37,968
Are we sure jumping into
a rusty mining car on a rickety track...

888
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:40,527
that leads who-knows-where
is the best idea?

889
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:44,611
- Come out, come out wherever you are.
- Sounds good to me.

890
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:48,120
We're safe now!

891
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:55,884
Ready or not, here we come!
Let's go mining for treasure.

892
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:00,807
Did we lose them?

893
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:03,880
They're right on our tails! Hold on!

894
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:24,325
I smell pumpkin pie. It's me!

895
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:31,520
Who puts a loop-de-loop in a lava mine?

896
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:35,125
Deer?

897
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:37,447
Dinkelman!

898
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:44,322
Out of ammo. Time to get touchy feely!

899
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:50,889
Come here, werewolf!
I got her backpack! Reel me in!

900
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:53,602
What does a werewolf need a backpack for?

901
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:57,048
- To keep his pilot license in.
- No!

902
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:00,602
Hey! Let go of my second favorite bear!

903
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:07,643
Let go of my Dinkelman!

904
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:10,845
Dinkelman! No!

905
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:18,370
- Dinkelman!
- Dagnabbit!

906
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:28,649
Elliot! Don't leave me!

907
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:31,246
Boog! I'll write you every single day!

908
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:40,246
Help!

909
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:49,322
Werewolf, you've won this round.

910
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:55,408
This ain't over!

911
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:04,170
It figures. There's one cactus in all of
Timberline and I land right on it.

912
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:05,685
Boog? I'm okay!

913
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:10,641
We landed in this super cushiony pile
of rose petals and clover!

914
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:14,926
Good thing we didn't land on old prickly.
Wasn't that crazy?

915
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:17,845
The dip where we went down
and our stomachs went up!

916
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,401
The lava singed my eye lashes!

917
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:23,643
Listen, Elliot, I've had enough!
This is too dangerous!

918
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:27,361
And now Dinkelman's gone.
You don't know what he meant to me.

919
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:31,287
Yeah... But we're safe now.

920
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:35,201
Safe? We've never been safe!
Crashing in airplanes...

921
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:39,160
getting shot at by hunters,
flying off the rails in a lava mine.

922
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:42,961
We're so close to finding the werewolf.
We can't give up now.

923
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:45,327
Now seems like the perfect time.

924
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:48,009
Boog, I believe in you.

925
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:52,131
When you want to be, you can be
a super brave bear. The superest.

926
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:54,726
I've had enough! I'm done!

927
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:58,930
I'm building that panic room by myself
and hibernating forever.

928
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:01,924
- Then after that, can we go camping?
- No, Elliot.

929
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:08,968
Fine. I take it back. You're not super!
You're a pooper! I don't need you.

930
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:11,925
All I need is one thing. Myself.

931
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:16,648
Because myself never hurts my feelings
like certain heavy-set bears.

932
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:20,885
- That doesn't even make sense.
- Words can hurt, you know, tubby?

933
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:24,690
Okay. Let's cool down for a second.

934
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:27,810
I stood up for you because
I thought you were my best friend.

935
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:29,121
Maybe you're not.

936
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:33,970
You don't care about me. You only
care about your stupid camping trip.

937
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:36,328
It's not stupid.

938
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:40,286
Go find yourself a new best friend
who likes selfish deers.

939
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:46,889
Well, you can forget about
that stupid camping trip!

940
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:50,487
I wouldn't go with you if you were
the last best friend on earth!

941
01:02:57,600 --> 01:03:02,367
You hear that? The werewolf is
out there! He's hiding in Dead Bear Gulch!

942
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:07,367
I'm going after him. I'm not a selfish deer.
I'm gonna save everyone.

943
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:11,047
Elliot, don't go. Shaw is gonna be
out there. It's too dangerous.

944
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:13,089
Danger is my maiden name.

945
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:15,286
Oh, no.

946
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:22,444
I never should have trusted Elliot.
How could I have been so stupid?

947
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:24,682
- Boog. Wait!
- I'm done with him!

948
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:27,366
Elliot went about things the wrong way,
but he was genuinely...

949
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:30,046
trying to help you get over
your fear of the werewolf.

950
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:33,210
Because all he cared about
was some dumb camping trip.

951
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:35,362
He wanted to spend time
with his best friend.

952
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:37,887
He tied pumpkins to my chest!

953
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:42,005
I'll be the first to admit, Elliot is
a ding-a-ling. But he's our ding-a-ling.

954
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:46,006
Can you give me a hand? I don't know
how you girls do this every day.

955
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:49,846
Elliot can take care of himself.
That's what he's good at.

956
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,002
Elliot is headed into Dead Bear Gulch.

957
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:54,208
He's convinced the werewolf
will be hiding there tonight.

958
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:57,728
Thanks for the tip. Pine needle eyelashes.

959
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:01,680
I'll be sure to stay far away
from Dead Bear Gulch.

960
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:04,889
Boog, he cares about you.
And you care about him.

961
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:07,611
The Boog I know
wouldn't abandon his friend.

962
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:13,563
The Boog I know is gonna build
his panic room. See you, Giselle.

963
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:20,570
So I am the werewolf. Go figure!

964
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:25,090
In order to not viciously eviscerate
my beloved friends...

965
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:30,644
I am destined to wander aimlessly
these vast woods alone, forever!

966
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:38,087
But I am so hungry! Oh, shoot.
That must be the werewolf in me talking.

967
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:42,723
Maybe if I don't look at the full moon,
I won't transform!

968
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:47,807
But it's so beautiful!
Maybe one little peek.

969
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:52,045
Oh, no! What have I done?

970
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:56,649
The transformation. It's on, baby.

971
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:10,803
As the werewolf blood courses through

972
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:14,282
My slender wiener dog body

973
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:17,922
I must wander these lonely woods

974
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:21,766
All alone, all alone

975
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:23,445
With the full moon

976
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:25,682
I must transform

977
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:29,367
Into the hideous beast

978
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:33,047
That will render Mr. Weenie

979
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:38,485
No more, no more

980
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:41,644
I'll grow real tall!

981
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:44,531
I'll be scary!

982
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:47,889
With lots of claws

983
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:49,405
And so hairy

984
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:52,325
These stubby legs will grow into

985
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:55,689
Four muscle-y weapons of ferociousness

986
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:58,923
My puppy dog eyes will burn blood red

987
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:02,801
My snout will grow into a toothy snarl

988
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:06,203
This silky coat

989
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:10,365
Will all fall out
And in its place a wolf-y mane

990
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:18,490
I feel a change and now

991
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:25,125
Yes, at last!

992
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:31,208
I am the werewolf!

993
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:36,764
Lupus homine

994
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:42,482
Which in Latin means "werewolf"

995
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:46,401
Yes, at last

996
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:53,609
Mr. Weenie is no more!

997
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:11,969
Hey, Booger. You hear that?
I called him "Booger."

998
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:13,360
What are you guys doing?

999
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:15,648
We took your advice
and built a panic room.

1000
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:18,127
Not bad. You got room for one more?

1001
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:20,248
- Come on in.
- Take a load off.

1002
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:22,164
Just close the door behind you.

1003
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:27,482
So where's your best friend Idiot?
You notice how I called Elliot "Idiot"?

1004
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:30,525
The great werewolf hunter
is in Dead Bear Gulch...

1005
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:33,445
probably talking the ear off of
some poor werewolf.

1006
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:40,688
That's where it all began.
In Dead Bear Gulch.

1007
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:43,002
That's where we'll find our werewolf.

1008
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:45,202
But that gulch is haunted, don't you know.

1009
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:47,010
Yeah! With evil spirits.

1010
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:49,891
Which is why the werewolf
will be hiding out there.

1011
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:51,923
We've got it on the run.

1012
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:55,482
It's gonna hunker down
in the one place it thinks we won't go.

1013
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:58,450
- And where is that?
- Dead Bear Gulch!

1014
01:07:58,600 --> 01:07:59,647
Oh, right.

1015
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:04,846
I got special camo for us in the truck.
We'll take him by surprise!

1016
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,765
- Take who by surprise?
- The werewolf!

1017
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:09,490
I love surprises!

1018
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:12,723
Instead of Dead Bear Gulch,
they're gonna have to call it...

1019
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:15,565
Dead Everything Gulch
by the time we're through.

1020
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:17,529
We'll blast everything that moves.

1021
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:20,729
- You mean like us?
- How can we hunt if we can't move?

1022
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:24,211
- I won't blast you!
- But we'll be moving!

1023
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:30,129
- Yeah! You said that...
- Forget what I said! Canadians.

1024
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:35,604
- Elliot's in trouble!
- What are we gonna do, Boog?

1025
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:37,842
Maybe we should go help him.

1026
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:59,167
Here monster, monster, monster.
Here monster, monster, monster.

1027
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:08,008
Elliot, please go. I'm a werewolf now.

1028
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:12,000
I don't want to hurt you,
but I am not in control of my faculties.

1029
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:14,561
Sometimes I'm not in control of
my faculties either.

1030
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:16,165
I just cover it up and walk away.

1031
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:21,167
Do your senses betray you?
Do you not see my vicious claws...

1032
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:26,167
my hideous fangs,
my irascible disposition?

1033
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:32,123
I have become the werewolf!
And there are more of us behind you.

1034
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:34,080
I'm sorry, what?

1035
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:39,841
My brothers.

1036
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:51,408
Danger isn't my maiden name!
It's McGillicutty. I know, weird, right?

1037
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:56,122
Oh, See-cret. I could sure
use your help right now.

1038
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:58,009
I need a hero to save me!

1039
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:06,283
Boog's butt? You're saving me?

1040
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,525
I'm a grizzly bear!

1041
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:24,725
Yes!

1042
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:40,684
Shaw? You mean there's no werewolf?

1043
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:46,330
Well, if we can't bag a werewolf,
a deer and a bear will do just fine!

1044
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:52,160
Come on, Canucks.

1045
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:57,888
The evil spirits! They're here!

1046
01:10:58,040 --> 01:11:02,921
Undead zombie ghost ducks
from hunting seasons past!

1047
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:06,529
- What?
- I brought some friends.

1048
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:11,322
We should consider taking our talents
on the road, eh, Deni?

1049
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:14,246
Where are you going?
I don't see any evil...

1050
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:17,449
Wait for me!

1051
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:20,285
Aye! Shake it, sister!

1052
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:28,242
Fine. Abandon me. I got Lorraine.
She's all I need.

1053
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:33,131
Face the wrath of a true werewolf!

1054
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:43,080
Lorraine! Now, you've gone too far.

1055
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:47,926
It's just you and me, bear. Mano a bear-o.

1056
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:55,762
Your shoe's untied!
Come on, teddy bear! Free shot!

1057
01:11:57,040 --> 01:12:00,283
Too fast for you! Guess who?

1058
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:03,731
Come on, scared-y bear!

1059
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:25,207
Crud.

1060
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:29,886
That's gonna smart for a few days.

1061
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:33,840
- I'm allergic to hornets!
- Washcloth?

1062
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:37,605
Buddy.

1063
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:43,443
Why did you come back for me?

1064
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:47,446
Because friends don't abandon friends.
You taught me that.

1065
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:50,891
My eyes are starting to pee.

1066
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:06,129
Nice shooting, sheriff.

1067
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:14,522
Well, looks like we've found our werewolf.
Shaw, I should have known.

1068
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:18,526
- I guess he's in deep doodoo.
- Sure is.

1069
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:21,491
Selfie! And post.

1070
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:23,963
- Bears.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1071
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:28,091
You'll have plenty to say
at your trial for posing as a monster...

1072
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:32,529
and creating a general panic.
Open season is closed.

1073
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:34,006
Permanently.

1074
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:37,324
Take them away, boys!

1075
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:44,731
Boog?

1076
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:56,042
Thought I recognized your work.

1077
01:13:57,720 --> 01:14:00,724
You know, you're always welcome
to come back home.

1078
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:07,761
He's going back to live in town.

1079
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:12,446
I understand. You are home.

1080
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:18,327
Technically, I shouldn't be feeding
the wildlife, but I think...

1081
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:22,451
we can make an exception.
Take care of yourself, Boog.

1082
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:31,522
I knew you wouldn't go back
to live in town.

1083
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:34,365
Of course not!
Who's gonna protect you, Elliot?

1084
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:36,409
You can't go camping by yourself!

1085
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:40,448
I got something for you.
I was waiting to surprise you.

1086
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:42,921
Surprise! Happy Mother's Day!

1087
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:45,363
Dinkelman!

1088
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:48,408
Hey, how long you had him?

1089
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:50,324
It's a See-cret.

1090
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:05,571
Hey, Boog! I can't believe it!
We're finally camping!

1091
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:09,930
I told you it'd be great. I got goosebumps
up and down my goose!

1092
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:14,130
Exactly how is camping different
than what we normally do in the woods?

1093
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:17,961
This is totally different!
It's just you and me, and the stars...

1094
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:21,442
above our horn and the dirt
beneath our fuzzy bottoms!

1095
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:24,763
I thought you said there would be
zip lines and parasailing...

1096
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:25,921
and boogie boarding.

1097
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:28,282
Haven't you ever heard of
writer's embellishment?

1098
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:31,011
- No.
- Me neither. I was hoping you knew.

1099
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:34,084
At least we're away from the riff raff.
See any riffs or raffs?

1100
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:36,447
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Ian. Hey, Giselle.

1101
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:41,447
So hard to keep the riff raff out
these days. Boog! Staring contest! Go!

1102
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:45,128
- What?
- You're good.

1103
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:49,691
- Hey! Let's tell a scary story.
- Really?

1104
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:54,448
I'll start. The Wailing Wampus Werewolf
was on the prowl.

1105
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:56,090
No one was safe.

1106
01:15:56,560 --> 01:16:00,849
Scary! And the vicious werewolf
emerged from the dark...

1107
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:05,688
through the misty mist, upon two friends
who were having a blast camping.

1108
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:06,921
I think that's a great setup.

1109
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:10,364
Nice try, Ian.

1110
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:16,884
Props on the fake teeth. Very convincing.

1111
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:18,769
Everything all right over there?

1112
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:23,086
This is not Ian?

1113
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:28,004
Nice werewolf, good werewolf.

1114
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:35,849
- I don't know what to do!
- Elliot! You know what to do.

1115
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:40,883
Boog! You're right! I've been training
for this moment my entire life!

1116
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:26,806
See? I told you!

1117
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:29,361
The werewolf communicates through
interpretive dance.

1118
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:32,729
Yeah. Interpretive dance and talking.
I can talk.

1119
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:37,729
- I think he means us no harm.
- Whatever.

1120
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:41,567
We need to show him we don't either.
Everybody dance now!

1121
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:43,171
Shake that tail feather!

1122
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:53,561
Bud... Bud...

1123
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:58,041
Busting a move!

1124
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:04,689
Impressive moves, Boog. We should
call you Dances With Werewolves.

1125
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:10,249
Boog, I have something shocking
to tell you. I might not be the werewolf.

1126
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:11,811
Got it, Mr. Weenie!

1127
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:37,080
And everybody lived happily ever after.

1128
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:40,687
Except for Mr. Weenie,
who is now a drifter.

1129
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:49,970
Oh, Bobbie! Or Bob.
How did it come to this?

1130
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:00,844
Bobbie lives!

1131
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:05,131
Surprise, Mr. Weenie!

1132
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:13,491
I feel like it's been forever!
Did Gordy feed you? We asked him to.

1133
01:19:13,680 --> 01:19:16,001
That would have been nice to know.

1134
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:18,322
We were at a See-cret convention...

1135
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:22,650
you know, "say it and see it." When
Bob says, "It's Mr. Weenie's birthday."

1136
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:25,087
And I say "Gee, Bob,
do you ever quit talking?"

1137
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:28,443
But then I say, "You're right!"
So we gathered up all of your friends...

1138
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:32,400
for a surprise birthday party.
Are you surprised?

1139
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:36,925
- Not pleasantly.
- Mr. Weenie is excited to see us.

1140
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:42,365
Are you excited to see him, Bob?
Oh, Bob is so excited, he's speechless.

1141
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:45,000
This is gonna be the best party.

1142
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:55,046
So, everybody did live happily ever after,
including Mr. Weenie. The end!

1143
01:19:58,120 --> 01:20:00,361
- Just one more time.
- No.

1144
01:20:01,305 --> 01:21:01,610
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
