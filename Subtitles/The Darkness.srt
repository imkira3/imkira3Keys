00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,685
- Beautiful spot, right?
- Amazing.

3
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,330
- You know what formed all this stuff, right?
- No.

4
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,404
Volcanoes, earthquakes, storms. Violent shit.

5
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,046
Did you know that there's
an entire city beneath the canyon?

6
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,241
Did you know that?

7
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,288
Isn't it amazing how fast kids grow up?

8
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,847
One day they're in diapers and next they're
debating you on politics and music.

9
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,401
What? Andrew is debating you
on politics and music?

10
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,361
- I'm impressed.
- I'm using the word "debate" very loosely.

11
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,363
Here we go, ladies.
Time to strap on a feedbag.

12
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,005
Yeah, chow time.

13
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,363
And every good meal needs a little booze.

14
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,681
Bronn?

15
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,161
I'm sorry. No, I'm sorry.

16
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,241
No, no, no. It's okay.

17
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,651
I got a soda around here somewhere.

18
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,484
God bless you.
I don't know how you can do it.

19
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,284
I mean, I need the booze,
if only to deal with this one.

20
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,203
Hey! Hey.

21
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,801
You know, you're gonna have to do
a lot of sucking up after that comment.

22
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,565
Sucking up? Magic fingers on the footsies?

23
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,125
- Foot massage. Come on, babe.
- That's fine. Not now.

24
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,770
Come on! Come on!

25
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,281
Gary, come on!

26
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,249
One foot massage before we eat. Come on!

27
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,966
- Gary, come on!
- Come here!

28
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,208
Hey! Where the hell you going?

29
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,368
Just going up the trail. I can see
where it ends from right here.

30
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,727
Did you ask Steph and Michael
if they want to join ya?

31
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,481
I'll go.

32
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,561
Keep an eye on him, okay?

33
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,130
You don't have to say it every time.

34
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,406
My turn?

35
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,970
Hey, no running, okay?

36
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,963
You twist an ankle out here
and we don't find ya,

37
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,164
you're gonna have to drink your own piss
and survive inside an animal carcass.

38
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,287
Gary!

39
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,330
What? Like Bear Grylls, honey,
that badass on TV.

40
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,880
What is wrong with men that
they're obsessed with this crappy show?

41
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,970
Really? I mean, that show
gave us our mad skills.

42
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,163
Yeah, I mean, we're, kind of,
the American version

43
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,566
- of Man vs. Wild.
- Yeah.

44
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,961
We stayed in hotel rooms
for most of the vacation.

45
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,765
We were camping for, like, four nights?

46
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,241
- Three?
- Three?

47
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,641
- Sure. I know that.
- Two and a half?

48
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,721
Two and a half.

49
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,926
Doesn't matter.

50
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:50,284
Look. If we ever were stranded,
say, near the wilderness...

51
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,488
We would handle it.

52
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,801
- Yeah. Boom.
- Oh!

53
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,407
Whose turn is it?

54
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,720
- You.
- You distracted us.

55
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,446
Bet there's all kinds of creepy
old shit in this place.

56
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,726
The only shit in this place
is spilling out of your mouth.

57
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,325
Whoa!

58
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,846
Hey, Mikey, do you know
how hardcore your sister is?

59
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,921
Guess not, huh?

60
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,442
Hey, he's smarter than you.
He just sees different, that's all.

61
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,441
What's he see then?

62
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:25,441
Nobody really knows, but he's on a whole
different level to the rest of us.

63
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,361
Meaning what?

64
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,610
For one thing, he's not afraid
of the things that scare most kids.

65
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,847
Let's find out.

66
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,929
- Don't be a jerk, Andrew.
- It's okay.

67
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,484
Hey, Mikey. Mikey.

68
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,404
Did you know the Indians
that used to live around here

69
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,606
thought this place was haunted?

70
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,730
Legend says, that the guardians
of their spirit world

71
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,689
lived in the rocks and the trees,

72
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,162
and that one day they're gonna
come back into our world.

73
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:02,850
And when they do, it means
the whole world's gonna end.

74
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,961
Really?

75
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,041
Yeah.

76
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,887
They're right behind you!

77
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,564
Guess that didn't work out, moron.

78
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,683
Look, I didn't mean anything by it.
Mikey knows that.

79
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,008
Here. You've had your eye on this all day.
You can have it.

80
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,204
Hey, there's some kind of
lookout up here. Come on.

81
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,689
- Come on, Mikey.
- No.

82
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,086
Mikey.

83
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,807
All right, just stay put, okay?

84
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,521
Don't move.

85
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,521
Gary!

86
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,646
- What's up?
- There you are.

87
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,886
Where'd you go, guys?

88
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,450
- We were just...
- I was looking for this guy.

89
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,843
I was lost.

90
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,445
He was lost. I found him.

91
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,726
Mikey! Mikey!

92
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,644
Uh, Mikey. Just a minute, buddy.

93
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,167
What?

94
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,129
Oh, my God. What is up with that dog lately?

95
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,366
Michael!

96
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,887
Uh...

97
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,203
- Honey, not now, okay?
- No? Really?

98
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,401
- Yeah.
- I wanna talk to you.

99
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,005
Yeah.

100
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,401
Don't go.

101
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,681
Kids are up.

102
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,366
Mikey.

103
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,566
Hey, I told you not to leave
the tap running in the kitchen.

104
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,686
Mikey?

105
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:36,321
Hey, come on. Let's get some breakfast.

106
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,841
Jenny did it.

107
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,448
Jenny? Who's Jenny?

108
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,880
She's my new friend.

109
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,040
Oh, that's nice. Where's Jenny?

110
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,241
In the wall.

111
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,406
Well, maybe Jenny's hungry, too. Come on.

112
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,801
Steph.

113
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,520
You in there?

114
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,846
Mom! What the hell?

115
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,082
Did you burn something in the kitchen?

116
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,850
Close the frickin' door!

117
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,251
Jesus H.!

118
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,321
Mikey, I told you not to do this.

119
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,008
What is that smell? Putrid.

120
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,363
Hey, buddy, do me a favor
and listen to Mommy today, okay?

121
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,601
Hey, family.

122
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,727
Hey.

123
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,928
- Breakfast, Stephanie.
- Later.

124
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,083
No bags on the table, Mikey. Remember?

125
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,771
- No, no, no, no.
- Okay. Okay.

126
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,923
That's like his new thing.
He's very attached.

127
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,170
Okay. No one's gonna touch your backpack.

128
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,366
Okay, buddy?

129
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,961
Ugh!

130
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,201
Babe, what's that smell?

131
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,769
I don't know. I think it's the trash.

132
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,490
Can you take it on your way out?

133
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,650
Yup. I'm late as it is, but okay.

134
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,004
- Maybe open a window, okay?
- Okay.

135
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,446
See you later. Gotta go.

136
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,641
- Gotta go. Gotta go.
- Love you.

137
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,171
Go. Go. Go. Gotta go.

138
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,841
Gotta go.

139
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,966
Go.

140
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,849
Just you and me again, Mikey, huh?

141
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,924
Five, six,

142
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,527
seven, eight,

143
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,806
nine,

144
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,244
ten. Hmm.

145
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,849
If I were Mikey,

146
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,443
where would I hide?

147
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,081
Boo!

148
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,167
Mikey.

149
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,927
Michael, you trying
to give me a heart attack?

150
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,360
What is it? "Bon Voyage"?

151
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,405
Well, no one's going anywhere,
but you can have one. Come on.

152
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,091
Okay, two balloons, then. Come on.

153
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,243
Come on, mister greedy pants.

154
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,206
Michael!

155
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,170
What the hell are you doing up here?
You scared me half to death.

156
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,044
How did you get up here?

157
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,560
Jenny showed me a way.

158
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,524
Jenny...

159
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,001
When I meet this Jenny,
I'm gonna have a word with her.

160
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,161
Now, come on.

161
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,921
Don't forget our safety in the...

162
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,483
Sweetie, come on.

163
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,760
Let's just get out of here. Come on.

164
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,207
These are the new offices.

165
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,851
The old offices,
you would not have enjoyed that.

166
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,327
Now the only other important
person you need to meet...

167
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,850
Well, not as important as me,
but I want you to meet Peter Taylor.

168
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:56,129
He's one of our top designers
and a great guy. You're gonna like him.

169
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,690
- I know you're doing...
- Peter!

170
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,886
All right, I gotta call you right back, okay?

171
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:03,560
Peter, say hello to Sammy.
New member of the team.

172
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,485
She can help you on the Foster project.

173
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,607
Hi.

174
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,921
She's a graduate, so she can
help you with whatever you need.

175
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,447
Design and drafting and project coordination,

176
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,005
CAD rendering, whatever you need.

177
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,730
All right, you guys talk.

178
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,721
Welcome to the firm.

179
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,724
Thank you, Mr. Taylor.
It's a pleasure to meet you, finally.

180
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,569
Sorry, I'm a huge fan of your work.

181
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,242
You came to my college last year and did
some lectures on modern design theory.

182
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,084
- Very fascinating.
- Thank you.

183
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,490
I'm just thrilled to know that anybody
actually attended one of my lectures.

184
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,481
- Hey. How was your day?
- It was fine.

185
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,447
Hey.

186
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,887
You're late again.

187
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,290
Hardly see you these days.

188
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,169
Yeah. I'm just super busy at work.

189
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,442
I told you, this project is like
the biggest thing we've ever done.

190
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,045
It's killing me.

191
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,963
Yeah. Well, can you put the vegetables on?

192
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,883
I've got a pile of work to do here myself.

193
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,803
Yeah, I'll do whatever you want
as soon as I get back from a run.

194
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,811
Well, don't bother then.

195
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,726
I'll do it. It's just a quick jog
around the block.

196
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,171
Twenty minutes max, okay?

197
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,090
What is up with that dog?

198
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,521
Yeah, she...

199
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,481
She's... She's not like that. She doesn't...

200
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,290
She... I don't know. She doesn't enjoy it.

201
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,286
Mmm-mmm.

202
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,970
I don't know. My birthday?

203
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,129
Yeah, look, I would if I could,
but I told you how things are right now.

204
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,486
It's just nuts with work and, um...

205
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,006
Yeah, I can't get out.
Tell me about it. All right.

206
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,281
Michael, were you in the bathroom just now?

207
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,483
Come on, answer me!
Stop hiding in this stupid place!

208
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:04,969
Michael, if you don't answer me,
I'm gonna mess up all your stuff.

209
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,966
One, two...

210
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,605
I wasn't in your bathroom.
Jenny was in your bathroom!

211
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,011
There is no Jenny!

212
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,320
- There is a Jenny!
- Don't you get it?

213
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,606
You freakin' made her up!

214
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,841
I didn't make her up!

215
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:23,051
Stephanie! Get out of here
and go to your room now!

216
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,845
- One...
- You okay?

217
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,161
Two,

218
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,641
three...

219
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,969
One, two...

220
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,647
Get the hell out.

221
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,290
Hey, watch it.

222
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,683
I thought you were asleep.

223
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,888
The light's on.
That's usually a hint I'm not.

224
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,766
Why do you provoke him, Steph?

225
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,682
Why do I get blamed
for everything in this family?

226
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,961
Honey, you know that's not true.

227
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,930
It is. You and Mom,
we never talk about anything.

228
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,402
We never talk about him. We never
talk about how he affects all of us.

229
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,290
We do. We do. We talk about...

230
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,930
No, you and Mom just ignore it.

231
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,651
We never talk about the creepy stuff he does.

232
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,566
It's getting creepier and creepier
and you just let him get away with it.

233
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,121
- Sweetie, here's the thing...
- I've got to study.

234
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,165
I've got to study.

235
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,966
Michael.

236
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,447
Hey, sweetie, what're you doing?

237
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,805
I kept hearing weird noises last night.

238
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,571
Freaked myself out, so I came in here.

239
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,080
What kind of noises?

240
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,002
Can you tell Michael to stay out of my room?

241
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,771
He keeps leaving dirty hand marks everywhere.

242
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,200
Hey, big guy.

243
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,850
Something's bugging you, huh?

244
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,965
Hey, Jeff. I was just seeing
what was up with your dog.

245
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,929
What you got,
a new cat over there or something?

246
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,448
No, Jeff, we don't have a new cat.

247
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,682
We don't have a bird or a fish or a gerbil.

248
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,569
We have no pets.

249
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,130
Maybe it's time to take yours to the vet?

250
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,287
Yeah, let me, uh, get right on that, huh?

251
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,126
Asshole.

252
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,207
Hey.

253
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,930
Get out! Get out!

254
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,487
What the hell? Shoo! Get out of here!

255
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,647
Get out! Get out! Get out!

256
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:36,288
I'm trying to help! I'm trying to help!
I'm trying to help you!

257
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,646
Peter!

258
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,086
I hate you!

259
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,488
- Hey! Hey! Hey! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
- I hate you!

260
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,762
- She's sick!
- You're a bitch!

261
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,600
She's sick!

262
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,206
She's so sick!

263
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,691
I hate you! Evil, bitch!

264
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,328
No!

265
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:56,448
She eats and then she comes
in here and she throws it up.

266
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,165
She's so sick.

267
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,327
Honey...

268
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,171
I'm sorry, Dad.

269
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,482
I know. It's okay. Come here, come here.

270
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,410
- I'm sorry, Dad.
- No, no, no.

271
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,364
Can I go for my driving test soon?

272
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,689
A promise is a promise in this family, right?

273
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,281
You know your mom and me
are not the enemy, right?

274
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,523
We just want you to get healthy
and happy and strong.

275
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,208
Get through this crap
and put it all behind you.

276
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,887
We only want you better, sweetheart.

277
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,761
Okay.

278
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,525
Look at you! Look how you've grown.

279
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,648
- Say hi.
- TV, TV, TV, TV, TV, TV.

280
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,370
- Okay.
- Okay!

281
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,567
Hiya, honey.

282
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,888
All right, well. Thanks for taking him
on such short notice, Mom.

283
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,529
Stephanie is not feeling so hot

284
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,763
so we just need to spend
a little bit of time with her, alone.

285
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,082
Okay, but any time, darling. You know that.

286
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,410
- All right. Well, I gotta go.
- Okay.

287
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,521
So, I'll see you tonight.

288
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,931
All right, don't worry.

289
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,961
- Thanks, Mom!
- Okay.

290
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,127
- Bye!
- Bye.

291
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:00,084
Okay, mister.
How about peanut butter and jelly?

292
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,723
I think it's time that we went and watched
your favorite television show.

293
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,371
Okay? I'm just gonna finish up in here.

294
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,169
And Keensy can keep you company.

295
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,527
Keensy! What's gotten into you?

296
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,327
Uh...

297
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,967
Michael, maybe you just better
leave him alone today, honey.

298
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,767
Mikey!

299
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,851
Bronny, where's your mom?

300
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,843
She's upstairs in observation.

301
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,085
- Mr. Taylor, I'm Dr. Jones.
- What happened?

302
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:17,011
Your wife's mother, she said that
somehow a snake got into the house.

303
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,446
A...

304
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,922
By the time the paramedics
got there, it was gone.

305
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,891
But she was obviously distressed, so we
gave her something to calm her down.

306
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,569
She said that she was hearing
strange noises in the room with him,

307
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,085
but when she got there he was alone.

308
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,810
Um, Mr. Taylor,
your son was trying to kill her cat.

309
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:39,283
No. No, no, no. That's not right.

310
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,528
He would never do that.

311
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,522
Hey, how you doing, buddy? Okay?

312
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,250
Just let me know if you have any questions.

313
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,046
- Okay. Thank you.
- We're in the hospital.

314
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,121
The hospital.

315
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,724
If I were Mikey,

316
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:56,128
where would I hide?

317
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,087
Oh, Michael!

318
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,401
Michael! Hey!

319
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,724
- Peter!
- Get down from there!

320
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,687
Sweetie, getting...

321
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,091
This has gone far enough. He's got to learn.

322
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,487
- Mikey!
- Look, getting angry doesn't help.

323
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,806
He's got to learn. Come on!

324
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,484
Sweetie, nobody got hurt.

325
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,561
This time.

326
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,211
Calm down. You're scaring him.

327
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,487
He's scaring me. Look, I...

328
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:51,687
I can handle the counting.
I can handle the forts in the living room.

329
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,728
The damn toys, I never get tired
of stepping on them.

330
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,610
But I draw the line at starting fires.

331
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:01,769
He's getting dangerous.
Why can't you see that?

332
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,764
Sweet... I'm not...

333
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,527
Mikey.

334
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,804
What? Come on, guys.

335
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,127
Hello?

336
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,690
Sammy. Hey, it's Pete.

337
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,167
- Hey!
- I'm really, uh, sorry to call you so late.

338
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,085
Oh, that's fine. No problem.
Is everything okay?

339
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:55,882
Yeah, yeah. I was just running through this
latest round of designs that just came in.

340
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,161
They're an absolute mess

341
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:02,326
and I think I'm gonna need some
one-on-one help to make this deadline.

342
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,489
I was just wondering if there's any chance
at all that you would be willing

343
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:08,848
to work late for a couple of nights

344
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,570
or maybe even over the weekend?

345
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,605
Yeah. Whatever I can do to help you.

346
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,920
Great, see you tomorrow.

347
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,641
Open fire!

348
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,090
Honey, uh, I'll tell you it's lucky
you caught it when you did

349
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,401
because the damage is mostly superficial.

350
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,280
I can just paint over it when I get the time.

351
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,441
I can fix it.

352
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,240
You know I'm very good with my hands.

353
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,764
I'm being serious, Peter.

354
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,329
How do you think he did it?

355
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,164
I don't know. It's just an accident, I guess.

356
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,089
He's playing around,
suddenly the room's on fire.

357
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,207
That's not what I mean.

358
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,601
How did he get the matches
in the first place?

359
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,888
They're in the cupboard
above the refrigerator.

360
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,770
Uh... Maybe we left them out.
I don't know. Stephanie?

361
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,450
Okay. Wait, wait. Hang on.
Hang on. I'm listening.

362
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:27,163
What I'm trying to say is do you think this
has something to do with us as parents?

363
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:30,244
Hold on. Please. Let's not start
blaming ourselves. All right?

364
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,608
Kids are affected by the problems
and emotions of their parents.

365
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,045
You heard Dr. Mitchell.

366
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,691
Right, and the very,
very expensive specialist

367
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,364
is never wrong about these things.

368
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,602
You're not hearing me, Peter.

369
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,927
What I'm trying to say is...

370
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,441
Yeah?

371
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,441
I think there's something else in the house.

372
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,803
Hold on. Please. Let's not start...

373
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,611
I mean, how do you explain the matches?

374
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,648
How do you explain the smells?

375
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,962
How do you explain the weird noises?

376
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,963
It's not ghosts, honey.

377
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:07,970
It's just Michael's autism
manifesting itself in a new way.

378
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,487
Stop being a jerk and listen.

379
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,850
Stephanie said she heard something, too.

380
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:17,601
Peter, maybe there is something here.

381
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:22,607
And I don't know.
Maybe it's some kind of karma.

382
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,642
Karma? Karma for what?
Bad things that we've done?

383
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,886
Come on, honey. You don't
really believe that crap? Do ya?

384
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:38,884
Will you please, please open your eyes

385
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,366
for once?

386
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,646
Wait, Bronny. Bronny.

387
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,041
Bronny.

388
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,362
The Anasazi were an ancient culture
that lived in the Colorado Plateau.

389
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:58,484
No one knows why they
built their fortified cities.

390
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,406
But we do know that their entire
civilization ended suddenly

391
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,164
when they abandoned their homes.

392
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:08,245
Some have speculated that the nature
spirits worshipped by the Anasazi

393
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:13,168
became destructive demons when the community
ceased to maintain their sacred laws.

394
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,843
These beings appeared in the form
of a coyote, snake,

395
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,491
crow, buffalo and wolf.

396
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,608
They terrorized the population.

397
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:25,082
Often appearing to children
before taking them away forever.

398
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,081
Knock, knock.

399
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:34,450
Oh, no! Don't do it to me. No, no more.

400
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,921
These are ready for you to review.

401
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,241
I will have the rest later tonight.

402
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,689
Is it always like this?

403
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:48,323
Yes. Actually, this is the average
level of panic and confusion

404
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,044
that makes this place so great.

405
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,487
Um...

406
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,566
Maybe, when this project is done,
you and I could get some coffee

407
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,007
and talk about what the rest
of the year is going to look like.

408
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,724
Maybe I can take some work off your plate?

409
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:04,201
Maybe we can even get a drink or...

410
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,366
Yeah, I appreciate that, Sammy.

411
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,091
But I think maybe it would be better

412
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,004
if we just catch up
at the regular staff meetings.

413
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,285
Uh, that way nobody is gonna
miss any of our brilliant ideas.

414
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:23,647
Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Okay.

415
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,882
They terrorized the population.

416
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:58,090
Often appearing to children
before taking them away forever.

417
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,321
This event was known...

418
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,724
- What do you think you're doing?
- Oh, shit.

419
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,844
Jesus Christ. What is up with you?

420
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,400
You're, like, a little edgy these days.

421
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,605
Really? I'm fine.

422
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:45,481
To be honest with you, chief, uh,
judging from your work, you're not.

423
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:48,080
Your whole team is down 10%.

424
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:52,125
So, my question is, what's the deal?

425
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:55,648
Simon, you gotta trust me, okay?

426
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:58,200
Now that you know how tricky this one is

427
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:02,086
and we will catch up
in the homestretch like always.

428
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,049
I promise you, no problem.

429
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:06,487
Mmm. Well, listen...

430
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,006
That is why you are the man around here.

431
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,410
Give me something. You got stellar capacity.

432
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:17,526
You've always had stellar capacity.

433
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,450
- I'm gonna see you for dinner, right?
- Yup.

434
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,686
All right, baby.

435
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,370
Hey, can you stay here a sec, hon?

436
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,646
Looks like a hell of a party.

437
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:26,285
Okay, you know to call me if there's
any problems with Michael.

438
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:27,486
Yeah, I know.

439
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:29,244
You can just call me, anyway. You know that.

440
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,800
Yeah, I know that.

441
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,368
I'm serious. No. You don't need it.

442
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,409
I like it. Thanks.

443
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,124
- You're beautiful because you...
- We gotta go, we gotta go.

444
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,283
Sweetie, can I just stay and you go?

445
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,771
Just call them and tell them I'm sick.

446
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:46,969
We cannot reschedule them.
You know what he's like. Let's just go.

447
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,122
We'll get it over with
and come right back. Okay?

448
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,531
Bye.

449
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,611
Are you sure you're gonna be okay?

450
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:55,047
Yes. I'm sure. I am sure.

451
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,770
- Where's my dress?
- What's wrong with that?

452
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:58,410
Simon will love it.

453
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,125
You sure we can't split it?

454
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,685
Hey, put your money away.

455
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:03,807
- You'll pay for it later.
- It's on us.

456
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,803
I did reach. You saw me reach, right?

457
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,090
Next time you bet your ass it's on you.

458
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:13,769
Bronny, I need to tell you about this
fascinating lecture I went to the other day...

459
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:15,644
Saw this guy on the Internet.
This is what he does.

460
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:16,846
- This guy on the Internet...
- Honey, can I talk?

461
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:21,286
He charges women whose husbands have
too much money to stare at them.

462
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:22,486
- That's what they do.
- No. Seriously?

463
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,688
Yeah, right? I told you
they stare at women. They go...

464
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,649
- "Okay, here's $1,000."
- Yeah, that's all he does.

465
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,007
So, who spoke at this event?

466
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:33,642
Oh, this amazing woman.
She's a psychic and a spiritual healer.

467
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:37,691
Her lecture was on ancient Hopi prophecy.
Do you know anything about...

468
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,967
That's funny you mention prophecy.
I just had a prophecy.

469
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:41,166
Oh, hold on a second.

470
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,884
In this prophecy,

471
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,885
Petey and I go to the bar
and we drink more alcohol.

472
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,724
And look, it's coming true!

473
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:23,641
Okay.

474
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:33,851
Side conference.

475
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:36,645
Tell me what's going on
with your little special project.

476
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,201
"Special project"?

477
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:39,641
Sammy.

478
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:43,287
I'm not... I'm afraid that project
is going to die in R&D.

479
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:45,408
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I gave it to you.

480
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:48,768
I teed it up perfectly. Are you kidding me?

481
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:52,845
I put it right in your hands
and you kick it out of bounds like that.

482
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:55,127
I used to look up to you.
You used to be my hero.

483
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,723
- Why?
- People change.

484
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:00,849
You're breakin' my heart, Fredo.
Breakin' my heart.

485
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:19,922
It was about her cleansing ceremonies
that she would perform.

486
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,241
- We're back.
- And... Hi, guys.

487
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,607
And you know, our son was sick
a few years back and she...

488
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:25,841
Okay, sweetie.

489
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,001
What?

490
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:34,729
Well, it's interesting, actually, Simon.

491
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:39,004
Stephanie's been having issues
and Michael's been acting strangely,

492
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:40,684
even for Michael and...

493
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:43,491
I'm thinking we should probably
hit the road, right?

494
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:47,201
I think it's got something
to do with our house.

495
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:49,368
Let's talk about this later, shall we? Okay.

496
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:50,886
With the house?

497
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:54,244
You got goblins and fairies
up in the attic? What do you got?

498
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,881
These guys aren't interested
in our little soap opera.

499
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,367
Thank you so much for dinner.
Honey, I think we probably should hit it.

500
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:01,247
Okay. Let's go.

501
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,124
- Yeah, thanks. This was amazing.
- Yeah.

502
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,926
- What are you so angry about?
- What do you think?

503
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,451
I embarrassed you in front of Simon?

504
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:26,331
He's disgusting with Wendy.

505
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,402
He bulldozes through every conversation

506
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:31,290
as if it just doesn't matter
if he's not the one talking.

507
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:33,840
Honestly, he is unbearable.

508
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,843
- That may be true.
- It is true.

509
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,002
But he's my unbearable boss

510
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:40,845
who is now going to tell
the entire goddamn office

511
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,361
that my wife can't get
through a single dinner

512
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:46,569
without bringing up
our personal family problems.

513
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:50,444
Thanks for dragging me along.

514
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,923
Steph, where's Michael?

515
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:16,601
Mikey?

516
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:23,086
Mikey?

517
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:06,442
Mikey. Honey.

518
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:10,206
Sweetie, I told you not to play
in here until we clean it up.

519
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:13,568
Sweetie, don't put your hands in this, honey.

520
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:15,210
You're leaving marks all over the house.

521
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:24,526
Hey.

522
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:32,049
Open up, buddy. There you go.

523
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:40,603
I think he's gonna be okay for a night.

524
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:43,047
I'll just take him to the doctor
in the morning.

525
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:46,089
You okay, big Mike?

526
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:51,721
Whatcha thinking about, sweetie?

527
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,765
The blue star.

528
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:58,411
It's close now.

529
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,649
What are you talking about?

530
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:12,446
His shirt's all dirty.
Can you take him upstairs and change him?

531
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:15,010
Let's get changed.

532
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:23,571
I told you we shouldn't
have left them here alone.

533
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:28,605
Yeah, I know. I know. You were right.
You're absolutely right.

534
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:03,526
Peter.

535
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,851
One, two, three.

536
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:30,120
One, two, three.

537
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,689
One, two, three.

538
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:36,446
One, two, three.

539
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:40,965
One, one, one, one.

540
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:43,850
Two, two...

541
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:17,202
One, two, three, four...

542
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:20,842
One, two, three, four.

543
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:25,405
One, two, three, four.

544
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,926
One, two, three, four.

545
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:31,962
One, two, three...

546
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:36,843
One, two, three.

547
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,322
One, two, three...

548
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:41,970
Mikey.

549
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:43,405
One, one...

550
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:44,925
Who are you talking to, honey?

551
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,240
The Sky People.

552
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:52,603
They want us to come and live with them now.

553
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,328
Our time here is over.

554
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:57,245
The Sky People...

555
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,609
Where are they?

556
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:03,566
They're right behind you.

557
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:07,925
No!

558
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:53,487
- Stephanie!
- Stephanie!

559
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,483
Oh, my God. Stay with her!

560
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:58,369
Stephie! Oh, my God!

561
00:53:58,440 --> 00:53:59,851
Are you okay?

562
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:19,921
Jeff! Your dog just attacked my daughter!

563
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:26,641
Unbelievable.

564
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:29,288
They said they have to wait
for somebody to become available

565
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:32,648
before they could even admit her,
maybe 20 minutes.

566
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,050
All the doors were locked.

567
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,202
Front and back. I locked them.

568
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,442
Well, then, somebody must have the key.
That's the only explanation.

569
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:42,806
I'll get the locks changed tomorrow

570
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:45,850
and I'll look at the rest of the doors
and windows while we're at it.

571
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,445
I don't know...

572
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,402
We're gonna be all right.

573
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:04,680
Peter, Mikey was in her room.

574
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:33,084
Jeff, look...

575
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:03,403
Crow.

576
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:09,246
Wolf.

577
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:18,081
Snake.

578
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:27,600
Buffalo.

579
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:35,726
Coyote.

580
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:54,166
I know it's been rough between us,
but we do need to talk.

581
00:56:55,920 --> 00:57:02,724
Things have gotten a little screwed up
around here for all of us.

582
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:07,084
"A little screwed up."

583
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:12,885
You didn't notice
when Stephanie's moods changed

584
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:15,281
and her weight dropped,

585
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:21,129
and your son's behavior
went spiraling out of control,

586
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:25,249
but now you want to talk.

587
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:26,401
Hmm.

588
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:29,008
So I don't notice things.

589
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:32,281
Okay.

590
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:52,726
And that's not what you think.

591
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:54,370
Really?

592
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:57,489
How can that possibly not be what I think?

593
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:59,483
Yeah, fuck you, Peter!

594
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:01,881
You don't understand anything.

595
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:06,960
My God.

596
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:11,325
What's happening to us?

597
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:14,170
Why did you do it, Peter?

598
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:17,481
Were you bored with me?

599
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:21,042
Did you just not want
your life with us anymore?

600
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:23,930
Jesus, you're bringing this up now?

601
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:29,647
The affair didn't mean anything.

602
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:35,681
And it's not who I am anymore.

603
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:38,611
Well, I'm still who I am.

604
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:40,648
And it meant something to me.

605
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:47,329
Well, like I said, I'm sorry.

606
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:49,886
Yeah.

607
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:53,440
Sometimes being sorry isn't enough.

608
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,407
- Petey!
- Shit.

609
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:18,404
What're you doing here?
I didn't see you in the office.

610
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:20,649
What are you, a ninja these days?

611
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:25,041
Just sneaking in to grab
some work to finish at home.

612
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:28,644
Listen, um...

613
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:32,690
I'm gonna need to...
I'm gonna need some time off.

614
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:36,528
'Cause things have just
gotten worse with the kids,

615
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:39,444
and I just... I just got to take care of it.

616
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:43,291
Yeah, okay. Okay.

617
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:45,888
Sure. Listen.

618
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,001
Uh...

619
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:51,921
You know the other night
I was giving Wendy a lot of crap

620
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,401
about all that airy-fairy
stuff that she's into,

621
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:00,923
but, um, the truth is,
years back, our little guy was,

622
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,970
like, three or four and he got sick.

623
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:06,088
He got, like, sick.

624
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:08,929
Like we thought we were
going to lose him, sick.

625
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:14,130
So we took him to all kinds of doctors
and specialists and nobody knew anything.

626
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:15,247
Nothing helped.

627
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:17,448
So, a friend of our friend...

628
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:19,966
He tells us about this healer.

629
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:22,008
That's what she does. She heals.

630
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:25,323
She's like wind spirits and water spirits...

631
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:29,642
Believe me, if I told you the crazy shit
she was telling us about, you'd laugh.

632
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:32,803
She tells us what to do, and we do it.

633
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:36,123
Everything she says, we do it to the letter.
We do what she says.

634
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:40,524
A week later, he's better.

635
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:42,728
There's like life in his eyes again,

636
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:46,771
and then four weeks later,
he's playing baseball.

637
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:53,204
So, is that a miracle?
I don't know what you call it.

638
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:55,567
Tell Bronny to call Wendy.
She'll tell her more about it.

639
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:58,450
But you've got to call this woman,
I'm telling ya.

640
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:02,769
Sometimes the answer you're looking for is
gonna come from someplace you're not looking.

641
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:05,003
Anyway, you get back, all right?

642
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:09,563
I need you, hombre.
Need you in there. Call her.

643
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:28,442
They terrorized the population.

644
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:32,127
Often appearing to children
before taking them away forever.

645
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:36,042
This event was known as the darkness,

646
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:39,920
and began with an infestation
of these shadow-like beings.

647
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:43,404
They would then torment
their victims until madness

648
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:45,767
or painful death followed.

649
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:48,002
As a desperate last resort,

650
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:52,290
the Anasazi priests trapped
the demons inside the ritual stones

651
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:55,330
they used to communicate with the beings.

652
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:59,206
They then hid them deep within the caves
that surrounded their homes.

653
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:03,171
If the stones were removed,
the demons would be freed.

654
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:06,250
Leading to the darkness descending once more.

655
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:09,608
Ancient writings revealed that
this curse could only be lifted

656
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:12,445
by returning the stones to
their original resting place.

657
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:15,729
And only by one among them who had no fear.

658
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:19,721
There have been many cases of people
who claimed to have located these stones

659
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:21,330
dying mysteriously.

660
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:24,768
Once happy friends
and families turned on each other,

661
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:27,969
and random accidents brought
death and disaster.

662
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:39,170
Here you go. Have a great night.

663
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:40,685
Okay. Thanks, you too.

664
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:19,601
Jenny?

665
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:40,845
Hey! Who's up there?

666
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:57,084
Jenny, is that you?

667
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:14,320
Oh, my God.

668
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:16,523
What the hell is that?

669
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:27,569
Stephanie, come on.

670
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:30,441
Okay, it's okay.

671
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:31,601
Sit right here.

672
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:33,091
No, no, no, no! Dad, don't leave me!

673
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:40,050
It's okay. I'm gonna get you.
It's okay. I'm gonna be right back.

674
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:53,922
Mikey! Mikey! Open the door!

675
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,206
Michael, come on. Open the door!

676
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:57,565
Come on, open the goddamn door!

677
01:05:57,680 --> 01:05:59,648
Michael, open the door!

678
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:04,926
Peter!

679
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:02,121
Hi.

680
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:05,129
I'd like a room, please.

681
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:08,086
Sure.

682
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:17,170
Well, it's a weeknight so you're in luck.

683
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:25,361
But the only room available
is the presidential suite.

684
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:27,283
- We'll take it.
- Sure.

685
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:29,046
Any bags, sir?

686
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:45,330
What are you looking for?

687
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:48,731
They have one in every
hotel room I've ever stayed in.

688
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:50,400
A Bible?

689
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:52,241
Huh?

690
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,321
I'm so tired. I think I'm going to pass out.

691
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:22,410
They took Bibles out of most
hotel rooms a while ago.

692
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:27,522
Oh, yeah? Why?

693
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:28,801
I don't know.

694
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:30,803
Apparently some people
felt it was discriminatory

695
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:33,360
to have just one religion represented.

696
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:37,607
Jesus.

697
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:38,886
Not anymore.

698
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:48,331
You know, I was thinking
about us the other day.

699
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:52,891
I was thinking about how we first met.

700
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:59,530
I admired you so much.

701
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:04,843
And when I saw you, it was just...

702
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:13,570
It still is...

703
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:19,050
Just love.

704
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:32,007
We deserve a happy ending, Peter.

705
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:37,086
I forgive you.

706
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:52,610
Hey, you know we could beat this together.

707
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:02,442
Do you like it?

708
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:20,962
Hi, Bronn. Yeah, come in. Come in.

709
01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:28,722
To be honest, I've never
experienced anything like this,

710
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:32,690
so I'm just not quite sure how to deal.

711
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:35,411
That's just it. I mean, few people do.

712
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:39,201
Some people don't even believe,
but I can tell you

713
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:45,207
everything changes pretty fast when
someone has a firsthand encounter.

714
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:49,484
I, uh, have Teresa's number.

715
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:55,321
Look, I know you're upset, but don't worry.

716
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:56,890
Just give her a call.

717
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:00,010
She's very good.

718
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:03,845
The world is filled with things

719
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:06,605
that we simply can't explain, Bronn.

720
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:13,011
It's just easier for most people
to focus on the things we can.

721
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:14,849
But it doesn't make them any less real.

722
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:26,211
Whose truck is that, Dad?

723
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:29,004
Someone to help, buddy.

724
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:33,009
Hi.

725
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:34,844
Honey.

726
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:36,809
So this is Teresa

727
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:40,248
- and this is her granddaughter, Gloria.
- Hi.

728
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:42,723
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

729
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:46,724
Steph, can you take Mikey,
and just keep an eye on him as we...

730
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:49,525
- Yeah. Okay.
- Just give us a minute. Thanks.

731
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:03,123
My grandmother's English is not
100% so I'll help out, okay?

732
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:14,083
Is there anything new or strange
someone has brought into the house?

733
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:16,646
Uh...

734
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:19,200
No, no, I don't... I don't think so.

735
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:23,966
Maybe you've been somewhere recently?

736
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:26,488
Somewhere you've never been before?

737
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:31,442
We went camping a few months ago.

738
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:35,127
Canyon De Chelly. Grand Canyon.
Hiking. That kind of thing.

739
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:42,965
It's a very important area.

740
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,890
It's the home of the Anasazi.

741
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:49,566
The people the Navajo Indians
call the ancient ones.

742
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:53,131
It's said they communed
with very powerful spirits.

743
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:57,486
Throwers and Forest Dwellers
and Shadow Creatures.

744
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:59,568
And they had rituals
to keep the ancient demons

745
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:01,369
trapped in another dimension.

746
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:04,644
A place called the third world.

747
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:07,007
Yeah, yeah. I read something about that.

748
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:09,082
That is why the Anasazi kept
their rituals hidden

749
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:13,080
so no one could open the doorways
and let these beings cross into our world.

750
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:19,846
So you're saying that's real?

751
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:27,567
Hmm.

752
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:32,246
There are five demons
that were mostly feared.

753
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:34,243
But their name cannot be spoken.

754
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:38,449
It's known that they manifest
physically as a crow,

755
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:40,841
a coyote, a snake,

756
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:43,890
a buffalo or a wolf.

757
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:46,764
That's not their true form.

758
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:50,448
If all five spirits appear,
it will be disastrous.

759
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:52,691
What do they want?

760
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:55,766
They bring out the darkness within people,

761
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:58,446
so their victims destroy themselves
or destroy each other.

762
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:16,289
What is she saying?

763
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,843
She says we must hurry.

764
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:23,367
They won't stop until
they get what they want.

765
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:26,730
We'll begin by performing
a clearing of the house.

766
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:30,043
Closing any portals
and banishing any dark spirits.

767
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:37,801
Dark forces exist everywhere.

768
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:39,882
Do you believe in any higher power?

769
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:41,721
Not really.

770
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:45,643
Now would be a good time to start.

771
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:48,810
Aren't you going to need that?

772
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:51,730
She's sensing older things at work here.

773
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:57,051
And the God you might be familiar
with cannot help you now.

774
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:18,091
Stay close.

775
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:46,526
Stay put.

776
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:04,001
Wait here. We'll deal with it.

777
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:20,690
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

778
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:23,524
What's going on?

779
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:27,929
Spirits will try to prevent us from clearing
the house and keeping them out.

780
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:46,770
No, Daddy!

781
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:48,410
Peter!

782
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:52,966
Are you okay?

783
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:55,571
They're getting stronger.

784
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:14,408
Mom, was that you?

785
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:16,522
I'm right here.

786
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:17,761
Something brushed...

787
01:19:24,280 --> 01:19:26,009
They won't hurt us.

788
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:29,804
They're going to set us free.

789
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:39,005
Michael! No!

790
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:43,006
You okay?

791
01:21:04,680 --> 01:21:05,920
Quickly, Grandmother.

792
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:30,126
No!

793
01:21:47,080 --> 01:21:51,005
Oh, my God. Teresa, are you okay?

794
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:52,921
Is she okay?

795
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:59,129
- Where's Mikey? Mikey!
- What's happening?

796
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:01,761
Mikey.

797
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,480
Mikey! Mikey!

798
01:22:14,440 --> 01:22:15,521
Mikey, open up!

799
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:26,486
