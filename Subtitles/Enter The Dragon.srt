1
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,113
Teacher.

2
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:43,454
I see your talents have gone
beyond the mere physical level.

3
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:47,708
Your skills are now at the point
of spiritual insight.

4
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:52,296
I have questions: what is the highest
technique you hope to achieve?

5
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:55,132
-To have no technique.
-Very good.

6
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,802
What are your thoughts
when facing an opponent?

7
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,679
There is no opponent.

8
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:01,389
And why is that?

9
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:05,685
Because the word "I" does not exist.

10
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:09,313
So. Continue.

11
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,359
A good fight should be. . .

12
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:19,073
. . . like a small play, but played seriously.

13
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:24,704
A good martial artist
does not become tense, but ready.

14
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:28,332
Not thinking, yet not dreaming.

15
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,002
Ready for whatever may come.

16
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:34,130
When the opponent expand, I contract.

17
00:03:34,298 --> 00:03:36,674
When he contracts, I expand.

18
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:39,427
And when there is an opportunity. . .

19
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,722
. . . I do not hit.

20
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,601
It hits all by itself.

21
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:49,353
Now, you must remember. . .

22
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:53,524
. . .the enemy has only images
and illusions. . .

23
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:57,194
. . . behind which he hides his true motives.

24
00:03:57,362 --> 00:04:01,032
Destroy the image
and you will break the enemy.

25
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:06,704
The "it" that you refer to
is a powerful weapon. . .

26
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:13,002
. . .easily misused by the martial artist
who deserts his vows.

27
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:18,507
For centuries now, the code
of the Shaolin Temple has been preserved.

28
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:24,347
Remember, the honor of our brotherhood
has been held true.

29
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:29,518
Tell me now the Shaolin commandment
number 1 3.

30
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:33,689
"A martial artist has to take responsibility
for himself. . .

31
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:37,610
. . .and accept the consequences
of his own doing."

32
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,240
I'm ashamed to tell you now. . .

33
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:47,119
. . .among all the Shaolin men
I have taught. . .

34
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:51,499
. . .there is one who has turned
the ways of knowledge and strength. . .

35
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:54,502
. . .to his own base ends.

36
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:59,590
He has perverted all we hold sacred.

37
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:02,802
His name is Han.

38
00:05:03,387 --> 00:05:07,014
In defiance of all our beliefs. . .

39
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:13,145
. . . he has brought disgrace
to the Shaolin Temple.

40
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:19,110
So it is now for you to reclaim
our lost honor.

41
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:22,405
Yes. I understand.

42
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:26,575
There is a man here.
You will go to him.

43
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:37,003
Hello, Mr. Lee.
My name's Braithwaite.

44
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,296
Hello, Mr. Braithwaite.

45
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:43,843
I've come to speak to you
about a matter of great importance.

46
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:46,971
-Have some tea?
-Yes, indeed.

47
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:52,435
This is very pleasant.

48
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:04,989
Mr. Lee, I've come to speak to you
about a tournament of martial arts.

49
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:08,117
A tournament to which
you've received an invitation.

50
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:12,371
Specifically, a tournament
organized by Mr. Han.

51
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:17,084
-Han's tournament.
-I know, I know, I know.

52
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:21,756
But we'd very much like you to attend
that particular tournament, Mr. Lee.

53
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:24,675
"We," Mr. Braithwaite?

54
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,846
It's Lao's time.

55
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:31,015
Yes, of course.

56
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:48,115
Kick me.

57
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,001
What was that? An exhibition?

58
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:03,714
We need emotional content.

59
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:07,051
Try again.

60
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:22,566
I said, emotional content, not anger.

61
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:26,403
Now, try again. With me.

62
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,499
That's it.

63
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:41,085
How did it feel to you?

64
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,923
Let me think. . . .

65
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:49,385
Don't think. Feel.

66
00:07:49,553 --> 00:07:53,973
It is like a finger pointing
a way to the moon.

67
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:57,685
Don't concentrate on the finger. . .

68
00:07:57,853 --> 00:08:02,273
. . .or you will miss all that heavenly glory.

69
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,317
Do you understand?

70
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:14,535
Never take your eyes off your opponent,
even when you bow.

71
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,788
That's it.

72
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,266
There.

73
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:45,936
That's Han. That's the only film
we have on him.

74
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:48,188
We know he was a member
of your temple.

75
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:52,192
A Shaolin monk, now a renegade.

76
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,697
That's Oharra behind him.
Personal bodyguard.

77
00:10:56,865 --> 00:11:01,118
Tough, ruthless, as you might expect,
being Han's bodyguard.

78
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:05,414
We got our hands
on a demonstration film of Oharra.

79
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:09,793
All real bricks and boards,
nothing phony about any of it.

80
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:13,922
This was before he picked up
a facial scar somewhere.

81
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:26,935
This is where you'll be going.

82
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:30,105
An island fortress, really.

83
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:36,028
After the war, the nationality of the island
was uncertain.

84
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:39,907
And sometime after that, Han bought it.

85
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:41,658
What do you know about Han?

86
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,203
He lives like a king on that island.

87
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:47,206
Totally self-sufficient.

88
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:49,166
All of his efforts, seemingly. . .

89
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:55,422
. . .are directed toward supporting
what he calls his "school of martial arts."

90
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:58,926
Han's only contact with the outside world
is this tournament. . .

91
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:00,969
. . .which he holds every three years.

92
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:06,850
This was a stewardess, Mary King,
found floating in the harbor.

93
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:09,686
Nothing unusual about a body
in the harbor.

94
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:14,024
But this girl was last seen at a party
aboard Han's private junk.

95
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:17,361
They'd reported her lost at sea
before the body was found.

96
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:20,155
We believe he selects attractive girls...

97
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:23,033
...methodically builds
their dependence on drugs...

98
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:26,662
...then sells them to an elite clientele
around the world.

99
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:29,706
What did the autopsy reveal
as the cause of death?

100
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:33,043
-She did not drown.
-She OD'd?

101
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:43,554
Yes. Cause of death was heroin overdose.

102
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:46,473
You still don't have enough
to bust up his operation.

103
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:50,936
We know everything.
We can prove nothing.

104
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:55,023
We want you to go in there as our agent.

105
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:58,694
-Get us our evidence.
-And get out in one piece to give it to you.

106
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:02,573
We'll give you anything you need.

107
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,367
Electronic equipment, weapons, anything.

108
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:08,162
-Drink?
-No, thanks.

109
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:09,705
Guns.

110
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:14,042
Now, why doesn't somebody
pull out a .45 and bang, settle it?

111
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,503
No. No guns.

112
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,548
Look at this map here.

113
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:25,971
As you know, the possession of a weapon
is a serious offense here.

114
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:31,977
Han's island rests partly
within our territorial waters.

115
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:35,898
If we had the slightest reason to believe
he has any kind of arsenal. . .

116
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,524
. . .we'd move in on him.

117
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:41,403
Besides, Han would never allow guns
on the island anyway.

118
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:46,116
He had a bad experience with them once
and he's fearful of assassination.

119
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:50,704
You can't really blame him.
Any bloody fool can pull a trigger.

120
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:53,207
I guess I won't need anything.

121
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:56,668
There's a radio on the island.
We'll monitor it. . .

122
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,754
. . .on the chance you can get to it.

123
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:00,339
And then you come?

124
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:03,759
Someone will.

125
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:06,094
We aren't an agency of enforcement.

126
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:10,432
We function as gatherers
of information, evidence.

127
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,852
Upon which interested
governments can act.

128
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:18,565
I see. If there's any trouble,
you make a phone call.

129
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:20,943
Oh, by the way, two months ago. . .

130
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:25,531
. . .we managed to place a female operative
on the island.

131
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,866
Since then, we've lost her.

132
00:14:28,243 --> 00:14:30,452
If she's there, she might have something.

133
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:33,205
Name's Mei Ling.

134
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:37,543
-Sure you won't have one?
-No, thanks.

135
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:20,669
But now the time has come to tell you
something very difficult.

136
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:25,924
I'm happy you have decided to go
to Han's tournament.

137
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,093
Yeah.

138
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:33,223
The last of the tournaments
were held three years ago.

139
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:38,562
I was in the city with your sister
at that time.

140
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,983
I didn't know that.

141
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,360
Yes.

142
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:49,156
Many of Han's men
had come in from the island.

143
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:53,702
They were everywhere,
bullying and arrogant.

144
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:57,039
We were on our way into town.

145
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,233
Stay back!

146
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,239
Run ! Run !

147
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:34,242
Now!

148
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:59,030
Now you know the truth.

149
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,616
When you get to the city. . .

150
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:06,788
. . . pay your respects to your sister
and your mother.

151
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,628
I will, old man.

152
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:35,567
You will not agree with
what I am going to do.

153
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:40,655
It is contrary to all
that you have taught me. . .

154
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:46,828
. . .and all that Su Lin believed.

155
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:57,339
I must leave.

156
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:04,346
Please try to find a way to forgive me.

157
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:11,121
Double or nothing?

158
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:14,416
That's about 1 000 bucks a foot, Roper.

159
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,420
Why not?

160
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:39,607
I'm sorry, Mr. Roper isn't in right now.
May I take a message?

161
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:05,425
That's a tough shot, Mr. Roper.

162
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,806
Excuse me, fellas.

163
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:15,226
-I say he can't make it.
-What'll you bet?

164
00:23:16,479 --> 00:23:17,896
You gotta love him.

165
00:23:18,064 --> 00:23:23,193
Come on, Roper.
It's 1 75 big ones by Monday the 1 5th.

166
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,612
Only 1 50.

167
00:23:26,447 --> 00:23:28,239
You forget interest.

168
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:32,660
-Maybe I ought to talk to Freddie.
-You take advantage, Roper.

169
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:34,662
Come on, fellas.

170
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,665
It's the dough, Roper,
or we gotta break something.

171
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:40,794
You got it?

172
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:45,840
Freddie says this is for your own good.

173
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:12,492
Better confirm that flight
to Hong Kong for me.

174
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:19,040
-How much do I have left in the bank?
-$63.43.

175
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:22,460
-It's all yours.
-Thanks.

176
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:26,089
-Only, I think you'll need it.
-You wanna bet?

177
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:00,475
Double-punching. Ready. . . .

178
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,468
Going on a trip, are you?

179
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:47,438
-Hey, this jig's got a passport.
-Where you going, jig?

180
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:53,695
-Where's the plane ticket for?
-Hong Kong, via Hawaii.

181
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,114
He's not going to Hawaii.

182
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:01,619
Well, look what we got here!

183
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:04,497
Assaulting a police officer.

184
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:58,051
-Hey, soldier, shape it up!
-Roper! Hey, how are you, man?

185
00:27:58,218 --> 00:28:02,263
How am I, man? How am I?
I'm glad to see you, that's how I am.

186
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:06,100
-Hey, how long has it been? Five. . .?
-Six years, man.

187
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:08,102
-Six.
-It's not as long as it seems.

188
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:09,729
Yeah, I know what you mean.

189
00:28:09,897 --> 00:28:13,691
-What you been doing since Nam?
-Hanging in a little bit.

190
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:15,943
-All these yours?
-Always first-class.

191
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:17,779
Same old Roper.

192
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:24,577
Come here.

193
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:31,000
-Parsons.
-Yeah, from New Zealand.

194
00:28:31,168 --> 00:28:34,045
This man's putting
quite a collection together.

195
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:36,130
Know him?

196
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:38,174
Never saw him before.

197
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:41,803
What do you know about this Han cat?

198
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:45,598
Just rumors. I hear he likes to live big.

199
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:52,271
They don't live so big over there.

200
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:54,982
Ghettos are the same all over the world.

201
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,443
They stink.

202
00:28:58,946 --> 00:29:00,738
Same old Williams.

203
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,117
Yeah.

204
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,953
What have we got here? A little action.

205
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:35,625
Insects. Okay, I'll lay you 50 bucks
on the big one.

206
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:38,878
Fifty. $50 on the big one, all right?

207
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:40,630
I'll give you 5-to-1 .

208
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:42,965
Would you bet 1 00?

209
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,093
You're on.

210
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:56,646
Come on, let's end this thing quickly.

211
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:00,858
Thattababy. Come on. Come on !

212
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:05,738
That's it. Just get him on his back.
Get him on his back! Come on.

213
00:31:05,906 --> 00:31:09,367
Come on. Give up!
Come on ! Hey.

214
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:14,497
Oh, for crying out loud.
Would you believe that?

215
00:31:17,918 --> 00:31:20,169
Dumb shit.

216
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:14,056
Do I bother you?

217
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:16,642
Don't waste yourself.

218
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:21,647
-What's your style?
-My style?

219
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:25,484
You can call it the art of fighting
without fighting.

220
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:28,321
"The art of fighting without fighting"?

221
00:32:29,156 --> 00:32:31,282
-Show me some of it.
-Later.

222
00:32:38,582 --> 00:32:40,333
All right.

223
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,003
Don't you think we need more room?

224
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,632
Where else?

225
00:32:48,842 --> 00:32:53,804
That island, on the beach.
We can take this boat.

226
00:33:01,355 --> 00:33:03,105
Okay.

227
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:20,039
Hey, what the hell are you doing?
Hey, are you crazy?

228
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,960
Pull me in ! Pull me in !

229
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:31,300
Don't try to pull yourself up
or I'll let go of the line.

230
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:33,904
Would you look at that.

231
00:34:37,868 --> 00:34:42,079
A woman like that could teach you
a lot about yourself.

232
00:35:05,562 --> 00:35:07,271
Welcome.

233
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:06,497
This way.

234
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:13,379
I'll show you to your rooms.
The banquet begins promptly at 8.

235
00:36:13,547 --> 00:36:16,757
I think you'll find our little island
quite charming.

236
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:17,962
Say, I hope you haven't spent all
that money you won from me yesterday.

237
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:20,673
-I plan to win it back.
-Oh? How?

238
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:24,802
You'll find out, after you've lost it.

239
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:28,597
You seem to be very much
at home here, Mr. Roper.

240
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,184
This guy Han's got a great sense
of hospitality.

241
00:38:32,352 --> 00:38:35,104
And a fantastic sense of style.

242
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,816
Yeah, it's great.

243
00:38:38,984 --> 00:38:40,859
Then why are you so apprehensive?

244
00:38:41,111 --> 00:38:42,820
Apprehensive?

245
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:47,825
No. I was just wondering
whether it was okay to drink the water.

246
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:51,745
Mr. Roper, don't con me.

247
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:53,205
Wanna bet?

248
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:08,012
No. I really don't think so. Thanks.

249
00:39:08,388 --> 00:39:10,389
What's the matter, you on a diet?

250
00:39:10,557 --> 00:39:14,059
I'd like to eat, if I could
find something I could keep down.

251
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:19,732
Well, I can't wait to meet our host.
I hear this is only one of his B parties.

252
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:23,235
You ever been to
a martial arts tournament like this?

253
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:26,113
Never.

254
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:29,575
I have a funny feeling we're being
fattened up for the kill.

255
00:39:31,745 --> 00:39:33,996
Better keep an eye out for the referee.

256
00:39:34,164 --> 00:39:36,582
-Know what I mean?
-Yeah.

257
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:15,579
Gentlemen, welcome.

258
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:18,290
You honor our island.

259
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:22,127
I look forward to a tournament. . .

260
00:40:22,295 --> 00:40:25,631
. . .of truly epic proportions.

261
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:28,592
We are unique, gentlemen. . .

262
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,887
. . . in that we create ourselves. . .

263
00:40:32,055 --> 00:40:34,932
. . .through long years
of rigorous training. . .

264
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:38,060
. . .sacrifice, denial, pain.

265
00:40:38,228 --> 00:40:43,315
We forge our bodies
in the fire of our will.

266
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:46,777
But tonight, let us celebrate.

267
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:52,783
Gentlemen, you have our gratitude.

268
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:01,894
Mr. Williams.

269
00:42:11,821 --> 00:42:13,363
Mr. Williams!

270
00:42:22,165 --> 00:42:23,999
For me?

271
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:29,087
You shouldn't have.

272
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:31,548
But. . . .

273
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:35,469
I'll take you, darling.

274
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:49,107
And you.

275
00:42:52,445 --> 00:42:55,781
Please understand, if I missed anyone. . .

276
00:42:56,157 --> 00:42:58,367
. . . it's been a big day.

277
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:00,118
I'm a little tired.

278
00:43:01,371 --> 00:43:04,331
Oh, of course, Mr. Williams.

279
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:08,168
You must conserve your strength.

280
00:43:10,797 --> 00:43:12,381
Come in.

281
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:19,721
A gift, Mr. Lee.

282
00:43:27,981 --> 00:43:32,150
-If you don't see anything you like. . . .
-There was a girl at the feast tonight.

283
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:33,652
Which girl, sir?

284
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,822
The owner of this dart.

285
00:43:38,658 --> 00:43:41,827
Oh, yes. I know the one.

286
00:43:42,537 --> 00:43:43,996
I'll send her to you.

287
00:43:51,796 --> 00:43:54,506
Another fine mess you got me into.

288
00:43:58,094 --> 00:43:59,720
Come in.

289
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:15,235
Hi.

290
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:19,614
Well, well, one more lovely than the next.

291
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:21,658
What did you have in mind?

292
00:44:21,951 --> 00:44:23,702
Pick one.

293
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:28,498
I already have.

294
00:44:30,877 --> 00:44:32,836
Wise decision.

295
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:48,852
I wanna talk to you, Mei Ling.

296
00:44:50,563 --> 00:44:52,147
Where do you come from?

297
00:44:52,315 --> 00:44:54,816
-Braithwaite--
-Let's be quiet.

298
00:44:55,068 --> 00:44:56,360
Have you seen anything?

299
00:44:56,652 --> 00:45:01,031
Nothing much.
I'm kept in the palace, watched always.

300
00:45:01,366 --> 00:45:04,576
I know nothing of Han's activities
away from the palace.

301
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,829
But I can tell you this: people disappear.

302
00:45:07,997 --> 00:45:11,249
-Who?
-The girls. Every one of them.

303
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:15,670
They're summoned to Han's at night
and the next day they're gone.

304
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:19,341
I know I don't have much time.

305
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:37,526
You must attend the morning ritual
in uniform.

306
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:39,611
Outside.

307
00:46:00,049 --> 00:46:03,301
Mr. Lee, why you no wear uniform?

308
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:05,197
Gentlemen, let the tournament begin !

309
00:47:11,454 --> 00:47:13,163
Bolo.

310
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:46,923
Good work. You made me some bread.

311
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,342
-Mr. Roper.
-I'm ready.

312
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:51,136
Okay.

313
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:56,474
I got myself a real pigeon here.

314
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:59,227
Keep the action going for me, will you?

315
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:01,271
What do you think, Roper?

316
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:06,818
Oh, no sweat.
Give my friend 8-to-3 all the way.

317
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:59,514
I'm finding out about myself.

318
00:50:59,932 --> 00:51:02,767
This is the real me, definitely.

319
00:51:03,436 --> 00:51:04,936
Do you like it here?

320
00:51:05,104 --> 00:51:07,272
Oh, yeah. But a little lower.

321
00:51:07,857 --> 00:51:11,109
No. I mean here on the island.

322
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:14,946
Yeah, I like it here.
But a little lower.

323
00:51:15,114 --> 00:51:17,615
A man like you belongs here.

324
00:51:24,665 --> 00:51:27,417
To you, I'm just another pretty face.

325
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:00,992
Where you go?

326
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,619
Out in the moonlight, baby.

327
00:52:02,995 --> 00:52:07,415
-It is not allowed. You must stay.
-Oh?

328
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,959
Goodbye.

329
00:57:51,844 --> 00:57:53,511
A human fly.

330
00:57:57,141 --> 00:57:58,766
Gentlemen. . .

331
00:57:59,268 --> 00:58:01,769
. . . it seems that one of you. . .

332
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:05,314
. . .was not content last night. . .

333
00:58:05,858 --> 00:58:10,027
. . .with the hospitality of the palace. . .

334
00:58:11,196 --> 00:58:16,868
. . .and sought diversion
elsewhere on the island.

335
00:58:17,536 --> 00:58:21,664
Who it was is not important. . .

336
00:58:21,832 --> 00:58:23,916
. . .at this time.

337
00:58:24,376 --> 00:58:27,545
What is important is that. . .

338
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:34,093
. . . my guards performed
their duties incompetently.

339
00:58:34,261 --> 00:58:37,054
And now they must prove. . .

340
00:58:37,222 --> 00:58:42,226
. . .themselves worthy
to remain among us.

341
01:00:25,664 --> 01:00:28,541
Are you shocked, Mr. Williams?

342
01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:31,961
Only at how sloppy your man works.

343
01:00:36,341 --> 01:00:37,508
Mr. Lee?

344
01:00:39,678 --> 01:00:41,637
Are you ready?

345
01:01:20,177 --> 01:01:23,304
Boards don't hit back.

346
01:01:27,309 --> 01:01:29,935
-Bolo.
-Go!

347
01:02:18,068 --> 01:03:35,186
Oharra!

348
01:04:36,331 --> 01:04:39,917
Oharra's treachery has disgraced us.

349
01:04:59,271 --> 01:05:02,147
If you wanna talk about this thing,
I'll be in my room.

350
01:05:02,315 --> 01:05:04,108
Gotcha.

351
01:05:07,612 --> 01:05:10,197
Williams? Williams.

352
01:05:10,365 --> 01:05:13,909
-Go to Han's study as soon as possible.
-All right.

353
01:05:18,206 --> 01:05:20,916
Hey, Roper.
I'll see you in half an hour.

354
01:05:21,084 --> 01:05:22,710
Right.

355
01:05:31,136 --> 01:05:34,054
-Mr. Han?
-You fought well yesterday.

356
01:05:35,223 --> 01:05:37,474
Your style is unorthodox.

357
01:05:37,892 --> 01:05:39,018
But effective.

358
01:05:39,644 --> 01:05:43,480
It is not the art,
but the combat that you enjoy.

359
01:05:44,649 --> 01:05:46,442
The winning.

360
01:05:47,193 --> 01:05:49,737
We are all ready to win. . .

361
01:05:49,904 --> 01:05:53,741
. . .just as we are born
knowing only life.

362
01:05:55,452 --> 01:06:00,414
It is defeat that you must learn
to prepare for.

363
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:04,293
I don't waste my time with it.

364
01:06:04,461 --> 01:06:07,421
When it comes, I won't even notice.

365
01:06:07,714 --> 01:06:09,214
Oh? How so?

366
01:06:09,883 --> 01:06:12,426
I'll be too busy looking good.

367
01:06:13,553 --> 01:06:16,555
What were you looking for
when you attacked my guards?

368
01:06:17,223 --> 01:06:18,641
Wasn't me.

369
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:22,436
You were the only man
outside the palace.

370
01:06:23,271 --> 01:06:27,066
I was outside, but I wasn't the only one.

371
01:06:27,567 --> 01:06:29,568
You will tell me who else.

372
01:06:30,236 --> 01:06:34,281
Mr. Han, suddenly
I'd like to leave your island.

373
01:06:34,491 --> 01:06:38,577
-It is not possible.
-Bullshit, Mr. Han-Man !

374
01:06:44,959 --> 01:06:48,754
Man, you come right out of a comic book.

375
01:07:11,778 --> 01:07:14,113
Been practicing, huh?

376
01:09:00,428 --> 01:09:04,723
-Williams is expecting me in my room.
-I wanted to talk to you.

377
01:09:04,891 --> 01:09:07,768
We will meet your friend Williams later.

378
01:09:07,936 --> 01:09:11,480
-Okay.
-This is my museum.

379
01:09:12,232 --> 01:09:15,067
It is difficult
to associate these horrors. . .

380
01:09:15,235 --> 01:09:18,111
. . .with the proud civilizations
that created them:

381
01:09:18,279 --> 01:09:23,450
Sparta, Rome, the knights of Europe,
the samurai.

382
01:09:23,618 --> 01:09:27,412
They worship strength
because it is strength. . .

383
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:30,666
. . .that makes all other values possible.

384
01:09:30,875 --> 01:09:33,877
Nothing survives without it.

385
01:09:34,087 --> 01:09:38,423
Who knows what delicate wonders
have died out of the world. . .

386
01:09:38,591 --> 01:09:41,468
. . .for want of the strength to survive.

387
01:09:41,678 --> 01:09:43,470
What's this?

388
01:09:48,142 --> 01:09:50,018
A souvenir.

389
01:10:00,989 --> 01:10:03,282
-Up here.
-A guillotine? No, thanks.

390
01:10:03,449 --> 01:10:06,034
This is the only angle I care
to see it from.

391
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:08,662
If you please, Mr. Roper.

392
01:10:11,291 --> 01:10:13,458
You want me to put my head
on that thing?

393
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:16,295
An act of faith.

394
01:10:18,423 --> 01:10:21,008
I'm a man of little faith, Mr. Han.

395
01:10:36,232 --> 01:10:40,569
Very few people can be totally ruthless.
It isn't easy.

396
01:10:40,737 --> 01:10:43,488
It takes more strength
than you might believe.

397
01:11:04,677 --> 01:11:06,887
Now you've got eight more.

398
01:11:14,729 --> 01:11:18,565
Then there is a point
you will not go beyond.

399
01:11:22,654 --> 01:11:24,529
Faked out again.

400
01:11:33,539 --> 01:11:35,540
This way.

401
01:11:46,177 --> 01:11:48,220
Our power plant.

402
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:02,818
Oh, yeah.

403
01:12:03,403 --> 01:12:06,446
A lifetime of women, huh?

404
01:12:06,614 --> 01:12:09,241
A man's strength
can be measured by his appetites.

405
01:12:09,409 --> 01:12:13,245
Indeed, a man's strength flows
from his appetites.

406
01:12:13,413 --> 01:12:16,748
Oh, no. They are my daughters.

407
01:12:18,626 --> 01:12:20,627
Your daughters?

408
01:12:22,255 --> 01:12:26,842
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought that--
I misunderstood. Miss Han?

409
01:12:31,764 --> 01:12:35,100
And also,
they are my most personal guard.

410
01:12:35,601 --> 01:12:37,728
I admire your judgment.

411
01:12:37,895 --> 01:12:41,606
Nobody's as loyal as daddy's little girl.

412
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:44,693
-Mr. Roper?
-No, thanks.

413
01:12:44,861 --> 01:12:47,779
I'll get up myself.

414
01:12:48,448 --> 01:12:49,948
Nice meeting you.

415
01:12:58,332 --> 01:13:00,333
Opium.

416
01:13:03,129 --> 01:13:07,299
We are investing in corruption, Mr. Roper.

417
01:13:07,467 --> 01:13:10,969
The business of corruption
is like any other.

418
01:13:11,137 --> 01:13:12,471
Oh, yeah.

419
01:13:12,638 --> 01:13:17,517
Provide your customers
with products they need. . .

420
01:13:17,685 --> 01:13:21,646
. . .and encourage that need a little bit
to stimulate your market. . .

421
01:13:21,814 --> 01:13:25,400
. . . pretty soon your customers
depend on you. I mean, really need you.

422
01:13:25,568 --> 01:13:27,652
It's the law of economics.

423
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:29,488
Right.

424
01:13:29,655 --> 01:13:33,575
And here we are stimulating
quite another need.

425
01:13:50,676 --> 01:13:54,679
You wonder why I am exposing
so much of myself?

426
01:13:54,847 --> 01:13:58,100
I forget what I see very easily.

427
01:13:58,351 --> 01:13:59,559
But then, why are you?

428
01:14:00,186 --> 01:14:05,107
I'm hoping you'll join us,
represent us in the United States.

429
01:14:06,526 --> 01:14:10,529
I'm beginning to understand the thing
with the tournament. The whole setup.

430
01:14:11,072 --> 01:14:13,532
It's a great way
to recruit new talent, huh?

431
01:14:19,539 --> 01:14:21,373
And who are they?

432
01:14:22,041 --> 01:14:26,044
The refuse found in waterfront bars.

433
01:14:26,838 --> 01:14:28,839
Shanghaied?

434
01:14:29,632 --> 01:14:35,637
Just lost, drunken men who no longer care
where they find themselves each morning.

435
01:14:42,895 --> 01:14:47,065
You left some rather
sizable debts in America.

436
01:14:47,233 --> 01:14:50,735
Diners Club hasn't called in my card yet.

437
01:15:02,999 --> 01:15:06,585
There were some questions
which I was forced to ask.

438
01:15:06,878 --> 01:15:09,004
I got no answers.

439
01:15:29,275 --> 01:15:31,610
And you want me to join this?

440
01:15:31,777 --> 01:15:33,945
There are certain realities.

441
01:15:34,113 --> 01:15:38,450
I want us to have a clear understanding.

442
01:15:50,671 --> 01:15:52,339
No.

443
01:15:53,633 --> 01:15:56,134
There's no misunderstanding between us.

444
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:11,603
Help me. Help, I'm 1 7!

445
01:18:11,937 --> 01:18:15,690
I'm from California.
Help me! Please, help me!

446
01:18:15,858 --> 01:18:19,819
Mister, come back, please!
You have to come back. Please!

447
01:18:19,987 --> 01:18:25,283
-Help me! Help me!
-Hey, quiet! Shut up!

448
01:24:19,638 --> 01:24:22,640
The battle with the guards
was magnificent.

449
01:24:23,308 --> 01:24:26,310
Your skill is extraordinary.

450
01:24:27,980 --> 01:24:30,982
And I was going to ask you to join us.

451
01:24:46,999 --> 01:24:51,335
My God. This came in half an hour ago.
Why didn't I--?

452
01:24:51,879 --> 01:24:54,881
Hello. Put your colonel on.

453
01:24:55,674 --> 01:24:57,675
Well, wake him up.

454
01:24:58,844 --> 01:25:02,263
I don't care if he's not alone.

455
01:25:04,016 --> 01:25:08,603
Damn it all, I don't care who he's with !
You bloody well put him on the line!

456
01:25:34,421 --> 01:25:39,050
Good morning, Mr. Roper.
We have been waiting for you.

457
01:25:40,052 --> 01:25:41,385
What's going on?

458
01:25:41,553 --> 01:25:45,807
Would you be good enough to participate
in this morning's edification?

459
01:25:46,099 --> 01:25:47,391
Edification.

460
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:55,149
What are you gonna do to him?

461
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:58,736
Not me, Mr. Roper. You.

462
01:26:01,573 --> 01:26:03,324
Bolo?

463
01:26:41,446 --> 01:26:43,447
Like you said. . .

464
01:26:43,824 --> 01:26:46,284
. . .there's a point I won't go beyond.

465
01:26:46,618 --> 01:26:48,786
I was right about you.

466
01:26:48,954 --> 01:26:53,291
We shall strive to be worthy
of your sense of grandeur.

467
01:26:53,625 --> 01:26:56,878
I will find someone with whom
you can fight.

468
01:26:57,087 --> 01:26:58,588
Bolo.

469
01:29:19,146 --> 01:29:20,730
Quick, go destroy them. Kill !

470
01:29:50,844 --> 01:29:52,678
Kill them !

471
01:29:58,143 --> 01:30:00,811
Kill ! Fools!

472
01:32:48,313 --> 01:32:54,151
You have offended my family
and you have offended a Shaolin temple.

473
01:38:22,981 --> 01:38:24,898
Remember...

474
01:38:25,066 --> 01:38:28,193
...the enemy has only images
and illusions...

475
01:38:28,361 --> 01:38:32,656
...behind which
he hides his true motives.

476
01:38:33,074 --> 01:38:38,161
Destroy the image
and you will break the enemy.

477
01:42:27,558 --> 01:42:29,559
