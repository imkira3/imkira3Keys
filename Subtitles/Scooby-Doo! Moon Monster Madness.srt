    Oh, right. It's Shannon.

 That's right. It was Shannon.

  She used Sly's

  It was a plan
  years in the making
  by a highly trained expert.

01:00:16,539 --> 01:00:18,906
        Yes, an expert.

    Someone who has sacrificed
    everything to get here.

984
01:00:22,411 --> 01:00:25,578
    Not some regular nobody
    that Sly had decided
    could simply go to space

985
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:28,614
 because it was easy
 and safe for everyone, anyone.

986
01:00:28,616 --> 01:00:30,916
   I decided to change that.

987
01:00:30,918 --> 01:00:33,251
     The original plan was
     to sabotage the ship,

988
01:00:33,253 --> 01:00:37,621
   stage an alien attack
   and make the world see that
   space travel is dangerous

 Two veteran astronauts to make
 the trip seem credible.

992
01:00:46,930 --> 01:00:49,096
      And you had U-Boat,

993
01:00:49,098 --> 01:00:51,998
 a superstar athlete
 that would ensure
 the whole world was watching.

994
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:56,935
 And Ridley, the one person you
 knew would confirm to the
 world that aliens were real.

01:01:01,941 --> 01:01:04,107
  by ignoring the actual facts

998
01:01:04,109 --> 01:01:06,409
      to get you
      a sensational story.

      it did for a while.

1009

       Wait, so I didn't get
       the highest score?

 came up with a different one.

1014
01:01:48,677 --> 01:01:50,543
       A plan that meant
       leaving you here.

    Be sure to get
    a close shot of my face.

              Sly!

      Shannon's explosives are
      starting to go off!

1083
01:05:26,146 --> 01:05:27,278
      We better get going.

1084
01:05:28,980 --> 01:05:30,447
      Does your ship work?

1085
01:05:30,449 --> 01:05:32,315
  There's still some glitches

1086
01:05:32,317 --> 01:05:35,284
    but with some quick work,
    she should be up
    and running in no time.

       There's too many.

1089
01:05:47,896 --> 01:05:49,262
     This could take days.

1090
01:05:50,030 --> 01:05:51,830
      We don't have days!

1091
01:05:51,832 --> 01:05:54,165
     Gee, Daph, you think?

1092
01:05:54,167 --> 01:05:57,134
  Did you just do all that math
  on your own or did your pal
  Shannon help you?

1093
01:05:57,136 --> 01:05:59,369
     Oh, I'm sorry, Velma.

1094
01:05:59,371 --> 01:06:01,838
   So Shannon wasn't perfect.

1095
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:06,141
   Perfect? Daphne, she's
   a homicidal lunatic that's
   about to blow up the moon!

1096
01:06:06,143 --> 01:06:08,510
  Oh, Velma, she's not going to
  blow up the whole moon.

1097
01:06:08,512 --> 01:06:10,745
  Just, you know, part of it.

1098
01:06:10,747 --> 01:06:13,547
      And that's
      supposed to be okay?

1099
01:06:13,549 --> 01:06:14,881
           Stop that!

1100
01:06:14,883 --> 01:06:16,749
       Stop! Stop! Stop!

1101

   Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

1102
01:06:18,919 --> 01:06:22,086
  For goodness sake,
  we're all going to die
  and all you can think about

1103
01:06:22,088 --> 01:06:25,255
 is arguing over who liked who!

01:06:25,257 --> 01:06:26,589
         You're crazy!

  You're not a robot, are you?

1106
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:31,726
             Nope.

    gotten away with it too.

        She's different.

   Oh, for Pete's sake, Ridley,
   she's not different.

       when we get scared,
       we resort to food.

    That's how we deal with it.
    Right, Scooby-Doo?

 has made her sleepy.

       No! No way, Velma.

1195
01:11:24,156 --> 01:11:28,024
    I can't. You heard Shannon.
    She faked the scores.

         with Shannon.

      You're the only one
      that saw how
      she flew this thing.

   more than I do about this.

   have faked your score, but
   it doesn't matter, Daphne.

  It's just a piece of paper.

1204

    I don't need
    a piece of paper to tell me
    what I already know.

 you put your mind to, Daphne.
