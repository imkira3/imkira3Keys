2
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:21,312
Run!

3
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:23,773
Run for your life!

4
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:26,150
- Keep away! Keep away!
- Take it!

5
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:27,443
Take all of it!

6
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:30,071
The monster took my shoe!

7
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:36,536
- Candy!
- Yay, treats. I love treats.

8
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:38,538
- Felicia.
- Hi, Daddy.

9
00:00:38,706 --> 00:00:40,957
That was a nice grip you had
on that big fat kid.

10
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:43,167
Farkle, excellent work with your teeth.

11
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:45,211
- Fergus, my lad.
- Daddy, Daddy, Daddy.

12
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,755
We're gonna have to work
on your timing.

13
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:50,675
All in all, not bad
for your first Halloween.

14
00:00:50,843 --> 00:00:52,969
They're growing up so fast.

15
00:00:53,137 --> 00:00:55,555
And look who got
her first clump of hair.

16
00:00:55,723 --> 00:00:58,641
Did you see?
Farkle got him in the ankle.

17
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:00,852
- What about little Fergus?
- Nothing yet.

18
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:02,395
That's all right, sweetie.

19
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:04,355
Mama didn't get a scare
this year either.

20
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:07,984
Fear not, my love.
The night is still young.

21
00:01:08,152 --> 00:01:10,903
Hold the phone.
Who left the door open?

22
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,989
You don't think that someone's inside?

23
00:01:13,157 --> 00:01:16,534
Now, who'd be stupid enough
to break into an ogre's house?

24
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:26,002
Oh, wow. Terrifying.
I don't know how I'm gonna sleep now.

25
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:27,754
Happy Halloween, everyone.

26
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,840
- Oh, man.
- You said this was gonna scare 'em.

27
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:35,428
Hey! I worked hard on this costume.

28
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:39,015
Admit it, Shrek. Weren't you even
a little bit scared?

29
00:01:39,183 --> 00:01:42,685
Donkey, ogres don't get scared.
We do the scaring.

30
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:46,022
And that's why
we're the kings of Halloween.

31
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:48,691
I bet we can find something
that would scare the pants off of you.

32
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:51,027
- Which would scare me.
- Oh, really?

33
00:01:51,195 --> 00:01:52,528
And what do you have in mind?

34
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:55,364
All of us telling scary stories
all night long.

35
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:56,949
There ain't no way you won't be scared!

36
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:00,077
Yes.
Stories to make your blood run cold.

37
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:02,371
- Yeah.
- Stories to terrify you.

38
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:03,372
Yeah.

39
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,500
And whoever shall last
through the night,

40
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:08,461
shall be named the King of Halloween.

41
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:09,712
I accept.

42
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,880
We doubly accept.

43
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:14,383
Does anyone else want to join
our little contest?

44
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:16,677
- I'm in!
- Ja, wunderbar!

45
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:17,720
Huzzah!

46
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:19,847
OK. I think
I'm going to take the kids out

47
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:21,891
and terrify a few more
trick-or-treaters.

48
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:23,184
Will I see you later?

49
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:25,353
- The night is young.
- Trick or treat.

50
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:28,064
I shall begin.

51
00:02:28,232 --> 00:02:30,107
Once upon a midnight dreary...

52
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:33,361
There was this crazy albino guy,
with a hook, and he lived in a mirror.

53
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:35,905
And if you even looked at him,
you'd wake up in a bathtub full of ice,

54
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:37,240
with your kidneys gone.

55
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:41,410
Whoa. Hey, hold on.
I didn't say we were doing this here.

56
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:45,540
- What?
- You name the terms, I name the place.

57
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,667
OK, fine!
Where we gonna do this?

58
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,255
Castle Duloc?

59
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,423
Ha, ha, very funny, Shrek.

60
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,592
But this is where Lord Farquaad lived.

61
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,219
Ja! Und died.

62
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:00,763
I heard it's haunted by his ghost.

63
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:04,100
If you're all too scared
to put on big boy pants and go in,

64
00:03:04,268 --> 00:03:07,186
I'll just claim my winnings
and be on my way.

65
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:08,396
Now, wait a minute!

66
00:03:08,564 --> 00:03:11,357
We can last in there
just as long as you can.

67
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:13,734
Fine. Come on then.

68
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,904
Hold up, Shrek. You can't
just go barging into some creepy,

69
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:18,447
spookyjoint like you own the place.

70
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:21,701
And why not? It's not like there's
anyone here to stop us.

71
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:24,078
I still don't know about this, man.

72
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:26,914
I'm getting a whole creepy
House of wax vibe going on in here.

73
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:30,501
Look, it's that little thingy
you love so much, remember?

74
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:35,798
Welcome to Duloc

75
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:37,758
It's a creepy town

76
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:41,596
What was once pristine
Now is all rundown

77
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:45,099
We will chop off your head
And then laugh when you're dead

78
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:48,811
Duloc is a creepy place

79
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:50,646
Come on in
What the heck

80
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:52,273
Fall right down
Break your

81
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:54,191
Face

82
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:58,988
Duloc is
Duloc is

83
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:04,660
Duloc is a creepy place

84
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:07,872
Get out.

85
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,791
- Let's do that again!
- No!

86
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:16,505
Well, then...

87
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:18,549
This ought to be fun.

88
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:20,509
Fun. Yeah, right.

89
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,178
I find myself agreeing with boss.

90
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:24,722
This looks to be
a very entertaining evening.

91
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,308
You know what? I just figured out
what your costume is.

92
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:28,643
You came as a kiss-up!

93
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,604
All right, all right.
Buckle up, everybody.

94
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:33,439
The quicker I scare the wits
out of you lot,

95
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:36,192
the sooner I can be home,
cozy in my bed.

96
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,029
Unless anyone else thinks
they've got what it takes?

97
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:43,282
Pick me, pick me!
I have a scary story.

98
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,285
This isn't the one about you getting
trapped in the petting zoo again, is it?

99
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:47,536
'Cause that's not scary.

100
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:50,581
Actually, if you look at it
from my perspective...

101
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:52,708
Hey, guess what, Pinocchio?
No one cares!

102
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:54,877
Get ready to send
these jokers home, Shrek,

103
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:56,712
'cause I've got a doozy.

104
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,715
And it's all true.

105
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:04,387
It was a dark and stormy night...

106
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:10,017
Gingy?

107
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:12,853
My girlfriend kicked me out.

108
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:16,899
You know, something about me
being too into myself.

109
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:21,195
You? But you are so adorable.

110
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:23,447
I know, that's what I keep telling her!

111
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:25,950
I need a good woman, Muffin Man.

112
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,619
I can help you, Gingy.

113
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:29,996
How about this one?

114
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,914
- I don't know.
- You like her?

115
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:33,416
No. Weird hair.

116
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,334
- How about this one?
- Too skinny.

117
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:36,711
No! Don't like it!

118
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,462
OK. Well, how about this one?

119
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,297
Yes! That's it!

120
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:44,218
She's perfect.

121
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:46,303
The girl of my dreams.

122
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,558
Wait. More sugar.

123
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:52,476
But that is not the recipe.

124
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:55,604
Trust me, Muffin Man,
this girl's gotta be real sweet.

125
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:58,065
I want someone
who will love me forever.

126
00:05:58,233 --> 00:05:59,525
I must warn you, Gingy.

127
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:02,111
No one has ever made cookies
with this much sugar.

128
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:05,906
You are tampering with forces
far beyond your comprehension!

129
00:06:07,743 --> 00:06:09,535
Just put her in the oven!

130
00:06:32,476 --> 00:06:34,351
OK, a little privacy?

131
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,811
Take a hike.

132
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,355
Oh, oui.

133
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,577
Oh, my gosh, I'm in love!

134
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,996
You're like a cookie angel.

135
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:57,041
Wow! And you're hot, too!

136
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:02,004
Hello?

137
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:06,425
I guess it didn't work.

138
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,938
Gingy. Is it you?

139
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:21,398
The one I was made for?

140
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:23,442
We'll be together forever.

141
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,111
Sweet!

142
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:57,268
Are you happy, Gingy?

143
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,562
You bet!
The time since I met you

144
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:02,731
has been the best...
seven and a half minutes of my life.

145
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:05,442
Good! Because this is
only the beginning.

146
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:08,070
I'm going to love you and hold you,

147
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:11,448
and feed you and dress you
and cling to you and...

148
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:14,368
...hang onto you and smother you
with my love.

149
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:16,704
- Yeah.
- Forever and ever and ever and ever...

150
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:19,623
You know,
it's getting a little stuffy in here.

151
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,917
You know, I'm gonna go get some air.

152
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:24,587
- Oh, no, you don't.
- Oh, no!

153
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,797
Not without your umbrella.

154
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:27,923
Come on!

155
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:29,592
Here, let me get that.

156
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,051
Wait for me.

157
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:34,930
Sugar, could you just do me
one small, little, teensy favor?

158
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:36,056
Anything.

159
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,933
Could you leave me alone
for like 30 seconds?

160
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:40,186
Anything but that.

161
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:43,105
Yeah, I forgot
my gumdrop buttons. Yeah.

162
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:45,691
Could you run over there
and get 'em for me, please?

163
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:48,569
Sure I can. I'll be right back.
Gingy, Gingy...

164
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:50,946
Run, run, run as fast as you can,

165
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:53,741
if you want to remain
a gingerbread man!

166
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:00,206
Oh, Gingy.

167
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:03,209
I don't understand.
I thought you were happy.

168
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,586
- Oh, well, I...
- It's all my fault.

169
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:07,213
I should have tried harder!

170
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,089
No, no, no! Don't try harder!

171
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:11,050
Maybe I'm not pretty enough.

172
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:14,386
I can be pretty! Really pretty.

173
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:15,971
The girl of your dreams.

174
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:19,016
- Remember?
- Leave me alone!

175
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:21,143
Gingy!

176
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,521
Let go, Gingy!

177
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:28,567
Fall with me,
so we can be together forever!

178
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:31,570
Here's a thought. You let go!

179
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:34,823
Together. Together for...

180
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:39,161
Boy, what a night!

181
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:41,872
I'm so glad that is over with.

182
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,833
- Oh, well, nothing lasts forever.
- In sports...

183
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:18,867
Together forever.

184
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,036
- Together forever.
- What a nice surprise.

185
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:30,379
Together forever.

186
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:33,007
Hey! So, what's up?

187
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:36,552
I think we both may have said
some things I might regret.

188
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,972
- Together forever.
- Gosh, your eye is pretty.

189
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,349
Look, I know you're upset, so...

190
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:46,478
Why don't we just sit down
and discuss this!

191
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,939
Then they ate me.

192
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,903
They're gonna do that
all the way home.

193
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,072
I gotta go.
They were my ride.

194
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,325
Wait a minute.
If they eat you,

195
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,618
how is it that you're still here?

196
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,830
Did you not say this was a true story?

197
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,374
Busted.

198
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:08,917
You made it up, didn't you?

199
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:12,338
I... Hey, look!
Lord Farquaad's ghost!

200
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:15,716
Doody heads!

201
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:18,719
And then there were three.

202
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:20,429
Who else wants to step up?

203
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:23,432
I, too, have a terrifying tale to tell.

204
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,434
It was a dark and stormy night.

205
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:27,144
Hey, hey. What the...?

206
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:29,563
And we needed to find us some shelter.

207
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:35,652
This is my turn to tell a story.

208
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,613
Hey, hey.

209
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:39,531
The kindly innkeeper
was warm and friendly.

210
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,367
She made me feel all bubbly inside.

211
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:44,328
My trusty sidekick here
would love to freshen up.

212
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:46,288
- Sidekick?
- And I would love some waffles.

213
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:50,042
- We are equals.
- Oh, man. Of course we are.

214
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,586
The noble donkey reassured his
clearly inferior sidekick.

215
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:54,088
I'm getting a little tired of this.

216
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:55,464
But before Puss could finish
his thought,

217
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:58,467
he decided to take
a well-deserved tongue bath.

218
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:00,260
What the...?

219
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:01,970
Well, as long as I am here.

220
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,515
But right then,
danger came from behind.

221
00:12:10,814 --> 00:12:13,690
And Puss was never seen again.

222
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:15,484
The end.

223
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:17,820
No! That is not how the story goes.

224
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,072
I was well aware
of the approaching danger

225
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,616
and went for my steel!

226
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:25,160
Don't worry, little buddy.
I'm here to save you.

227
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:26,912
Oh, you're killing me.

228
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:31,208
It was Prince Charming. He was packing
heat and he wanted revenge!

229
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:33,001
- I want revenge!
- He said.

230
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,129
But before anyone could do anything...

231
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:39,258
It was awful and it was terrible
and it was really, really scary.

232
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:41,260
What? No! Go back.

233
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:44,430
Although the Charming was fast,

234
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:47,850
I was swift enough to repel the attack
and leap to safety.

235
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,602
Which is exactly
what he wanted you to do.

236
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:54,022
Charming laughed,
just like a crazed maniac.

237
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:02,948
No, I'm sorry, but I would never
let that happen to me.

238
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,367
Instead, I... I woke up.

239
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:08,787
Yeah, that's right. It was all a dream.

240
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:11,707
You mean a nightmare. You know
you're on the ceiling, right?

241
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:14,376
I will get you for this.

242
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:16,336
Oh! And then the lights went out.

243
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:19,590
It was horrible and sad
how Puss pleaded for mercy.

244
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,091
Mercy? Please.

245
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:23,051
Said Puss,
with his last dying breath.

246
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,345
But when the lights came back on,

247
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,639
it was the donkey
who was taking a shower.

248
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,808
Oh, my goodness.
Why would I do that?

249
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:32,227
And right behind you,
there was danger.

250
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:34,730
- Oh, man.
- You were paralyzed.

251
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:37,232
It was a donkey-eating waffle.

252
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,860
It was packing heat
and it wanted revenge!

253
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:42,571
I want revenge!

254
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:44,323
The donkey... ran.

255
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:46,867
But how far can you run
when you are on a plate,

256
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:49,286
covered in butter, wearing a pink tutu?

257
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:50,871
- No!
- And a sombrero!

258
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:54,208
And a coconut brassiere!
And about to be eaten alive!

259
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,794
No! Please!
Please, I'll switch to pancakes.

260
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:04,176
And the donkey was never seen again.

261
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,264
But what Puss didn't know
is that right behind him

262
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:11,391
was the one thing he feared more
than anything else.

263
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,602
- No. You wouldn't.
- I would.

264
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,020
- You didn't.
- I did.

265
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:18,106
No! Anything but that! No!

266
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:24,446
The end.

267
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:26,782
I'm pretty sure that's cheating.

268
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,617
It worked, didn't it?

269
00:14:30,245 --> 00:14:33,121
Who's next in our little contest?

270
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,915
Has anyone seen the mice?

271
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,254
Are we there yet?

272
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:46,134
OK. I think it's time for a story
that's actually scary.

273
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:48,887
Yeah, whatever.

274
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:51,306
You had your chance.
Now then.

275
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:56,019
Something beyond comprehension
was happening to a little boy

276
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:59,147
on this street, in this house.

277
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:02,150
A man had come as a last resort,

278
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:07,072
because... no one else
would go near the place.

279
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,746
I hear you've been expecting me.

280
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,748
- You are the...?
- That's right.

281
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,417
I am...

282
00:15:19,294 --> 00:15:21,420
...the babysitter.

283
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:23,338
Yes, yes.
Thank goodness that you've come.

284
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:29,595
My boy. I don't know
what's gotten into him.

285
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,013
I've never seen anything like it.

286
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,682
Trust me, buddy, I've got
three little ogres at home.

287
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,642
This will be a piece of cake.

288
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,936
Father.

289
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:42,524
Father!

290
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:45,527
- OK, then.
- Look, I'm telling you.

291
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:47,904
I've tried every trick in the book.
You see?

292
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:51,283
"Once Upon A Time-Out"?
Oh, come on, now.

293
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:54,328
- You're gonna listen to a goose?
- Please. You don't understand.

294
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:55,787
It's like he's two different people.

295
00:15:55,955 --> 00:16:00,208
What your kid needs is discipline, not
a bunch of psychological mumbo jumbo.

296
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:03,337
You just gotta walk in there,
look him in the eye,

297
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:04,963
and show him who's...

298
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,218
Please tell me he's an only child.

299
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:12,179
Bubblegum fish pants...

300
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:14,222
Hello.

301
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:17,643
Well, here's your problem.

302
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,686
His head's not screwed on right.

303
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:21,980
When you wish upon a star,

304
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:24,358
you get lots of stuff.

305
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,735
Well, I wish for a nice, quiet evening

306
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:29,404
where you go to sleep
and I raid the icebox.

307
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:30,614
OK.

308
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,622
See? That was easy.

309
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:41,500
It's like I always say,
when it comes to good parenting,

310
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:43,418
you have to be fair but firm.

311
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:46,088
You just show 'em
that you mean business...

312
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,881
And he's out of bed again, isn't he?

313
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,011
You never have this problem
with sock puppets.

314
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:56,598
All right, what's this all about?

315
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:57,933
Voices.

316
00:16:58,101 --> 00:17:01,061
- Voices?
- In here.

317
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:04,106
Telling me what to do.

318
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:07,442
You have voices inside your head.

319
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:09,111
Sometimes.

320
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:12,989
And what kind of things
do they tell you to do?

321
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:20,789
The early bird catches the worms!

322
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:22,457
What's gotten into this kid?

323
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,126
Hey! You're going to...

324
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,294
Maybe you sing him a little song.

325
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,296
Come here, you... Hey!
What the...?

326
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:31,591
Do I look like the kind of guy
that knows a lullaby?

327
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:32,718
Sing!

328
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,970
Lullaby and good night

329
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:38,223
Close your big creepy eyes

330
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:41,393
If you sleep
Away I'll creep

331
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:45,731
And get out of here alive

332
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:50,152
You know, once you get past
all the splinters and rope burns,

333
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,279
he's actually kind of cute.

334
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,906
Now where did he go?

335
00:17:56,284 --> 00:18:01,163
A bird in the hand is worth
two in the bush.

336
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,999
Now there's something
you don't see every day.

337
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:06,835
Get him off! Get him off!

338
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,345
Come back here, you!

339
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,890
I regret nothing!

340
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,866
I'm too young to have termites!

341
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:40,702
I'm no termite, Pinocchio.
I'm a cricket.

342
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:44,164
You were the voice in my head
this whole time?

343
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:45,332
That's right.

344
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,210
I'm the one who was putting
all those thoughts in your noggin.

345
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,504
I'm your conscience,
and as long as you let me,

346
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,005
I'll always be your...

347
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,928
The end.

348
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:02,724
That wasn't me.
I never had any bugs in my head.

349
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:03,975
Ask anyone.

350
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:07,354
OK, then. Why don't we start
by asking your conscience.

351
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:17,072
Now who's cheating?

352
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:20,408
Well, Donkey,
looks like it's just you and me.

353
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:24,037
Go ahead. There ain't nothing
you can say that can scare me.

354
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:26,414
Oh, well, I suppose
there's nothing left to do

355
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:30,085
but sit here in the dark
and wait for the ghost.

356
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:31,586
Ghost? What ghost?

357
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:33,338
Farquaad's ghost, of course.

358
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,423
As a matter of fact,
if I remember correctly,

359
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:39,427
I believe you had a hand
in his untimely demise.

360
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:40,929
Hey, man. That was an accident.

361
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:43,682
And besides, all that ghost stuff is
just an urban legend.

362
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,308
- You know that.
- Is it?

363
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:52,065
OK, OK, that's...
that's just the wind.

364
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:53,608
Donkey!

365
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:55,735
And apparently it knows my name.

366
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,951
That's very funny, Shrek.
But I know it's you doing this.

367
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:06,371
Hey, I'm standing right here
with you, Donkey.

368
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,959
No way. This place is
not haunted by a ghost,

369
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:13,712
and when the sun comes up,
Donkey will be the new King of...

370
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,922
It's right behind me, isn't it?

371
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:22,387
- Donkey.
- Oh, my goodness!

372
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:31,396
Well, that's what I'd call
a "knight" to remember.

373
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:34,149
What do you say
we scare ourselves up some dinner?

374
00:20:34,317 --> 00:20:37,402
I'd say... grab the kids
and let's get going.

375
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:42,282
And that's why
we're the Kings of Halloween.

376
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:45,327
He was so scared. We probably
won't see him for a month.

377
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:48,747
So, what else have you got
in your bag of tricks?

378
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,166
I've got seven eggs.

379
00:20:51,334 --> 00:20:52,667
Perfect.

380
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,713
I love this holiday.

381
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,214
Oh, very nice!

382
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:00,258
I am not happy!

383
00:21:01,305 --> 00:22:01,266
