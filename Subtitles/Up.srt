DUG: Oh, I am ready to not be up high.

1122
01:25:49,603 --> 01:25:52,271
Sorry about your house,
Mr. Fredricksen.

1123
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:57,693
You know, it's just a house.

(CHICKS CHIRPING)

1126
01:26:05,744 --> 01:26:07,912
Look at you. You're so soft.

1127

(HONKS)

1128
01:26:10,499 --> 01:26:12,082
ALL: Aw!

1129
01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:13,959
I wish I could keep one.

(HISSES)

1131
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:20,382
Where's my cane? I just had it here.

(GAGGING)

1133
01:26:28,642 --> 01:26:31,977
You know what? Keep them.
A little gift from me to you.

1134
01:26:32,854 --> 01:26:34,396
Bye, Kevin!

1135

(HONKS)

1136
01:26:43,824 --> 01:26:45,115
Ready?

1137
01:26:45,492 --> 01:26:46,826
Ready.

(BARKING)

1139
01:26:57,587 --> 01:26:59,338
STRAUCH: And by receiving
their badges,

1140
01:26:59,422 --> 01:27:04,093
the following Explorers will graduate
to Senior Explorers.

1141
01:27:04,469 --> 01:27:08,305
For Extreme Mountaineering Lore.
Congratulations, Jimmy.

For Wild Animal Defensive Arts.
Congratulations, Brandon.

1143
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:15,688
For Assisting the Elderly...

1144
01:27:16,523 --> 01:27:19,692
Uh, Russell, is there someone that...

1145
01:27:22,445 --> 01:27:25,531
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Old man coming through.

1146
01:27:28,368 --> 01:27:29,869
I'm here for him.

1147
01:27:30,078 --> 01:27:32,329
Congratulations, Russell. Sir.

1148
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:38,586
Russell, for Assisting the Elderly

1149
01:27:39,045 --> 01:27:43,257
and for performing above
and beyond the call of duty,

1150
01:27:44,217 --> 01:27:48,512
I would like to award you
the highest honor I can bestow.

1151
01:27:50,891 --> 01:27:52,641
The Ellie badge.

1152
01:27:55,645 --> 01:27:56,729
Wow.

1153
01:28:01,443 --> 01:28:03,944
STRAUCH: All right,
I think that covers everybody.

1154
01:28:04,029 --> 01:28:06,071
So let's give a big Explorer call

1155
01:28:06,364 --> 01:28:09,867
to our brand new
Senior Wilderness Explorers.

1156
01:28:10,118 --> 01:28:11,243
Ready, everybody?

1157
01:28:11,328 --> 01:28:12,870
ALL: Caw, caw! Raar!
Caw, caw! Raar!

01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:21,629
- Blue one.
- Red one.

1161
01:28:22,297 --> 01:28:24,089
- Blue one.
- DUG: Gray one.

1162
01:28:25,050 --> 01:28:27,051
- Red one.
- RUSSELL: That's a bike.

1163

CARL: It's red, isn't it?

1164
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:31,096
RUSSELL: Mr. Fredricksen,
you're cheating.

1165
01:28:31,306 --> 01:28:33,098
CARL: No, I'm not. Red one.

1166
01:28:33,183 --> 01:28:34,975
RUSSELL: That's a fire hydrant.

1167
01:28:35,268 --> 01:28:36,602
(BOTH LAUGHING)

1168
01:28:37,103 --> 01:28:39,146
CARL: Maybe I need new glasses.

1169
01:28:39,481 --> 01:29:02,378
RUSSELL: Another blue one.

1170
01:34:01,719 --> 01:34:05,931
Adventure is out there
It's heading our way

1171
01:34:06,099 --> 01:34:10,102
So grab your scarf and goggles
Let's fly

1172
01:34:10,478 --> 01:34:14,773
I've mapped out our journey
We're up here to stay

1173
01:34:14,857 --> 01:34:19,111
A sunset is our home
A moonbeam we will own

1174
01:34:19,237 --> 01:34:22,990
My spirit of adventure is you

1175
01:34:23,533 --> 01:34:27,703
Freaks of nature span a globe
That's too big to deny

1176
01:34:27,787 --> 01:34:32,124
With canine guards we'll travel there
and spit into their eye

1177
01:34:32,625 --> 01:34:36,837
Bang, bang
Once the smoke has cleared

1178
01:34:36,921 --> 01:34:40,841
After all the crowds have cheered

1179
01:34:40,925 --> 01:34:45,429
We'll make it a joint venture
Before we're in our dentures

1180
01:34:45,513 --> 01:34:49,141
My spirit of adventure is you

1181

Adventure is out there
Let's crack some champagne

1182
01:35:11,581 --> 01:35:15,834
I've hung a hundred heads
on my wall

1183
01:35:15,918 --> 01:35:20,338
To say that I'm traveled
is far too mundane

1184
01:35:20,423 --> 01:35:24,718
Let's grab our aero-fare
The high-brows will be there

1185
01:35:24,802 --> 01:35:29,056
The spirit of adventure
is something to indenture

My spirit of adventure is you
