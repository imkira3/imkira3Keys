1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,535
But this isn't a time of endings. No.

3
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,600
This is a time of new beginnings,
a time of transformation, change.

4
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,255
I know change isn't always easy

5
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,655
but change is what's going to allow us
to grow as individuals

6
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,409
and embrace our destiny.

7
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,495
To become the persons
that we were meant to become.

8
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,575
Hey, Jesse!

9
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,640
One of my personal favorites,
William Arthur Ward...

10
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,455
"...a blessing or a curse,

11
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,084
a dawn or a dusk."

12
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,455
It's time for us
to embrace the next chapter of our lives.

13
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,855
And I know we're ready.

14
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,928
Thank you, class of 2012. Thank you.

15
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,570
Thank you.

16
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,775
So, 5 bucks,
your brother fell asleep.

17
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,375
My brother did fall asleep,
I bet with the <i>babas.</i> Exactly. Yes.

18
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,368
'Cause that principal was drunk.

19
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,569
Jesse! Jesse!

20
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,884
Congratulations, brother.

21
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,761
- What are you wearing?
- Shut up.

22
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,842
Show the love.

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,735
- Hey, look who's here.
- My number one right here.

24
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,295
- Get a picture.
- You two.

25
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,495
- Get a picture, Hector.
- Show the diploma.

26
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,249
Two, three...

27
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,655
Take one real quick.

28
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,815
- All the best friends?
- All the players.

29
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,735
Oh, oh...

30
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,255
Ah. Look good, fools.

31
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,655
- Hey, what's up, Oscar?
- You good?

32
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,135
- Yeah, congratulations.
- Great speech, man.

33
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,335
This is my mom

34
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,495
- and he's my brother, Arturo.
<i>- Hola.</i>

35
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,480
You guys have a nice summer,
all right. Take care.

36
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,655
What? That's his brother?

37
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,015
Man, this camera's nice.

38
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,135
- Si. How much is it?
- It was about $300.

39
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,055
You think I could like,
you know, record and stuff,

40
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,415
mess around with it? I won't drop it.

41
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,055
I like this camera, Dad.
I'm serious.

42
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,135
All right. Just be careful with it.

43
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,775
Hey, Chavo!
You hear that? Daddy graduated.

44
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,135
Yeah, barely.

45
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,215
- Don't hate, appreciate.
- Hmm.

46
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,208
- Seriously, though...
- What?

47
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,375
Mom would have been
really proud to see you graduate.

48
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,055
- I wish she would've been here.
- Oh.

49
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,375
Thank you. That's like
the nicest thing you've ever said.

50
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,575
Oh, do not get used to it.

51
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,895
You actually got a turnout.

52
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,447
Right? People actually
care about me. Hey, Marisol!

53
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,375
- Hey! How are you?
- Where were you today?

54
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,495
I told you I couldn't get off of work.
But I made you some salsa.

55
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,095
- Hey...
- Thank you.

56
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,895
- Congratulations.
- Thank you so much.

57
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,335
- How does it feel?
- I feel like a man now.

58
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,775
Hey, give me the camera, dude.

59
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,895
Did you see that?

60
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,080
Chug it!

61
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,806
Yeah, Grandma!

62
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,295
Newspaper all over the window?

63
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,575
That's weirdass Ana.

64
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,255
Yeah, my crazy neighbor
Ana lives there. She lives right under me.

65
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,415
And so, in my dad's room,
there's a vent that connects to her room.

66
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,215
And sometimes
in the middle of the night...

67
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,375
I'm talking about like,
weird sounds, dude.

68
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,375
I hear like, wailing, moaning.

69
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,575
Jess! Jesse! Listen!

70
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,170
We got to go, man! Come on.

71
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,445
Nice! All right! All right, let's go.

72
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,805
Yeah, that's nice.

73
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,281
It is high definition.

74
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,455
How much is it then?

75
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,481
Uh...

76
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,801
Two-fifty.

77
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,723
- Two-fifty?
- Two hundred, that's it.

78
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,935
That's it, 200.

79
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,975
I'll just go somewhere else then.

80
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,895
I think 250 for that is cheap.

81
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,684
I can knock it down.

82
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,521
- So, 200, it's the most I can...
- One-fifty?

83
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,804
You know what?
What about... Wait a minute.

84
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,961
Wait a minute. Come!

85
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,815
So you're not
gonna give it to me for 150?

86
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,575
No, no.

87
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,568
I'll give you for 200.

88
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,321
But, I'll give you this for free.

89
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,649
Welcome to my neighborhood.

90
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,087
That's my mansion, right there.

91
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,449
It's actually <i>cochinero,</i> but...

92
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,841
Fuck it.

93
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,975
- What's up, little man?
<i>- Hola.</i>

94
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,055
Right up there, to the top on the left.

95
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,415
That's my best friend, Hector.

96
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,441
He lives right there.

97
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,003
And then, straight to the back...

98
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,091
Fuck, where's the zoom, man?

99
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,841
Shit, it's good.

100
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,850
That's crazy Ana's apartment.

101
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,161
She lives right under me.

102
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,763
She covers her windows
so nobody sees what she's doing.

103
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,520
I'm gonna take you
up to my pad right now.

104
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,606
Oh, shit!

105
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,370
Who's that sexy man?

106
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,964
Sexy... Oh, fuck!
My hair's crazy right now.

107
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,564
This is the pad, right here.

108
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,886
Anybody... Hey, Chavo!

109
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,761
Hey, boy!

110
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,055
Look at you!

111
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,081
Papa!

112
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,241
What?

113
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,855
- You in here?
- Yeah.

114
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,881
What are you doing?

115
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,295
What do you think I'm doing?

116
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,446
This is my room, right here.

117
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,015
Oh, you gotta check this out.

118
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,451
This is what you call ghetto.

119
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,084
Barn! That's my side of the room,
right here.

120
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,415
The other side's where my dad lives.

121
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,441
What's that?

122
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,449
It's cool, right? I just got it.

123
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,415
I just got it at the pawn shop.

124
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,441
The pawn shop?

125
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,931
- Look for a job.
- I will.

126
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,921
I'll see you. Bye.

127
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,081
- All right.
- Love you.

128
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,921
Come here, Chavo.

129
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,320
Hey, let's go look for Grandma.

130
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,721
Oh, I can hear her.

131
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,011
Probably doing her prayers.

132
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,287
What the fuck is that?

133
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,764
<i>Este es el</i> Chake Weight.

134
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,571
- Mmm-kay.
- Chake Weight.

135
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,884
Oh, Shake Weight.

136
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,966
Shake Weight. Shake Weight.

137
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,241
Feels like a Shake Dick
or something.

138
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,935
<i>Nada. Ten.</i>

139
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,255
<i>- Nada.
- Es</i> Chake Weight.

140
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,611
Okay.

141
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,962
Chavo. Did you hear that one?
Shake Weight.

142
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,361
Got you. Look at this dumb-ass.

143
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:20,615
What the fuck is he doing?
Oh, shake it, shake it.

144
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,895
Oh, man, I would not
let this guy work for me.

145
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,135
What's up?

146
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,161
What?

147
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,775
Yeah, yeah. I'll go over there.

148
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,007
I finally got this shit, dawg!

149
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,295
- It looks ill, right?
- Yeah, that's dope.

150
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,121
- Don't drop my shit.
- I'm not gonna drop it.

151
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,375
- Sick, man.
- You'll get fired.

152
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,215
I bet I can work better
than your dumb ass anyways.

153
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,846
Dude, look at this zoom, man!
This zooms in hella deep.

154
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,975
- Come check this out!
- Oh, shit!

155
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,375
What the fuck are you doing?

156
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,975
Oh, fuck.
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

157
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,095
What the fuck are you guys doing?

158
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,255
Nothing, man.
Nothing, nothing, nothing.

159
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,055
What do you mean nothing?
You got a fucking camera!

160
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,335
It's not even recording, man,
I swear.

161
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,775
Bullshit! It's not even on, huh?

162
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,015
- Fuck you!
- Hey, come on!

163
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,335
Give me the fucking camera!

164
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,815
Fuck! Go!

165
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,335
Fucking idiot, man!

166
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,885
Go! Run, run, run!

167
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,455
Yo, what is that?

168
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,975
It's a GoPro.
I got it with my camera.

169
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,121
What the fuck are you doing?

170
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,680
It's gonna be dope. Watch. All right.

171
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,935
Look, this is the way you move it.

172
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,255
Oh. Hell, no. You won't...

173
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,335
I'm not getting in that shit.
I'm not eating all your food,

174
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,695
I'm eating a fucking tortilla right now

175
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,360
'cause you didn't have chips or anything!

176
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,282
I'm not getting in that shit.
I'm not getting in...

177
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,975
Go for it!

178
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,049
Man... Shut up, man.
Get your ass up here, then.

179
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,935
Fuck, no. I ain't going up there.

180
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,055
I don't even got insurance.
You're gonna pay for...

181
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,215
Stop being a pussy!

182
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,855
Three... Two... One... Go!

183
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,723
Shit!

184
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,441
Ah! Fuck! Shit!

185
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,455
Ah... Fell on my nuts!
Oh, my God, my dick, man!

186
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,535
My God, dude, like,

187
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,085
I can't believe
you actually went through with it!

188
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,415
Man, you get your ass up there
and do it!

189
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,975
I'm not gonna do...
I'm not the stupid one.

190
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,095
That was high, dude. Holy shit.

191
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,215
That's not cool, man.
You're always making me do dumb shit.

192
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,375
Hey, when you were going down,
like, how did it feel?

193
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,080
What the fuck is this?

194
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,535
Yo, is that coming
from Ana's apartment?

195
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,565
Yeah, dude, that's Ana.

196
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,215
Holy shit! Dude, that's Oscar.

197
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,651
Yo! Oscar!

198
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,015
Hi, Jesse.

199
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,849
What are you doing here, man?

200
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,695
Yo! What the fuck?

201
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,735
That's the dude from your school?

202
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,415
- Yeah, man.
- Arturo's brother?

203
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,615
- That's the same dude?
- Yeah.

204
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,775
What the hell was he doing here?

205
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,451
What the fuck
was he doing in Ana's apartment?

206
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,735
Yo, that lady's
fucking weird, dude.

207
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,649
- I don't know what he was doing here.
- So, how does he know Ana?

208
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,095
What you cooking?

209
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,135
No cooking.

210
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,535
Irm, want some tequila?
I got a surprise for you.

211
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,287
What are you talking about?
Oh! You don't?

212
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,641
Only half.

213
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,415
You'll get a good night's sleep.

214
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,055
- Whoa!
- Fucking...

215
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,366
Look at that!

216
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,655
Look at that!

217
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,535
- For your grandma Irma.
- Yeah!

218
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,208
Ah!

219
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,455
Whoa!

220
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,255
Oh, yeah! One more round.

221
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,170
Come on. Please.

222
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,765
Wait up.

223
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,844
Did you guys hear that?

224
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,450
What is that?

225
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,288
Someone's getting fucked.

226
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,526
Oh, fuck!

227
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,015
What the fuck?

228
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,335
What the fuck is that?

229
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,535
I don't know.
Didn't sound good though.

230
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,695
I wish
we could just see down there.

231
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,975
Get your little GoPro thingy.

232
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,844
We'll just tie it down,
and we'll put it down there.

233
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,175
With what?

234
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,725
Yo.

235
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,975
You got it?

236
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,415
Yeah, dude, I found these little ropes.

237
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,855
- You just tie this shit on there.
- Holy shit.

238
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,611
And I got the Hedmi cables
that my uncle got.

239
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,925
Fool, it's an HDMI cable.

240
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,415
Got it! Got it! Got it! Check it out.

241
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,646
Come on!

242
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,255
- Go check over there.
- All right.

243
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,044
Keep going. It's still dark.

244
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,163
It's still going down the vent.

245
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,055
Oh, shit. Hey! Holy shit!

246
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,135
No, no, no, yeah... Wait, wait, that's it.

247
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,607
I see something.
I just saw something. Half of some shit.

248
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,969
Oh, shit!

249
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,015
There's a fucking...
There's a naked girl!

250
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,215
There's a naked girl!

251
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,895
Look at her! She's fucking fine!

252
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,135
Are you serious?

253
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,735
No, no, no, stay right there!
Stay right there! Oh, fuck.

254
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,535
I want to see. Turn the TV.

255
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,495
Dude, what...
She got bigass titties. Oh, shit.

256
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,775
- Come get this shit.
- No, just stay there!

257
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,495
No.
This is the best day of my life.

258
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,935
You should fucking stay in there.
You shut the door.

259
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,095
- Turn the TV.
- You stay there.

260
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,575
What... All right. All right, hold on.

261
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,329
Dude, she's buck naked!

262
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,615
Oh, fuck! Oh, shit!

263
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,575
No, no, no, it's okay!

264
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,680
You can do your laundry later!

265
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,691
Lock the door, idiot!

266
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,725
Shit!

267
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,815
What the fuck, dude?

268
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,255
- She's just standing there, man.
- She look good?

269
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,815
Yeah, hell, yeah,
she looks good.

270
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,215
- Fuck!
- She got good titties or what?

271
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,655
- Oh, shit!
- What?

272
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,855
- She got a dick?
- Dude. Fucking... No!

273
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,484
There's...

274
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,448
Ana... Ana's fucking...

275
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,295
Ah, dude!

276
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,415
What do you mean, "Ana"?

277
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,175
She's fucking naked, man!
What the fuck?

278
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,884
Holy shit, dude!

279
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,975
I just lost my boner, man. My dick's...

280
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,135
...soft, like, forever.
What the fuck, dude?

281
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,495
Turn the TV. I can't see shit.

282
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,615
What is she doing?
No, she's...

283
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,769
- She's, like, fingerpainting on the...
- What?

284
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,535
She's fingerpainting her?

285
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,295
Painting with her fingers.

286
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,415
She's painting some red circle shit
on that girl's stomach.

287
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,095
Turn the fucking TV.
I can't see shit.

288
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,360
Dude, I... I...

289
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,695
Oh, fuck, dude, pull it up, pull it up!

290
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:39,575
I think she heard you,
so shut up, don't say anything. Pull it up.

291
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,335
- Did she hear me?
- Shut up.

292
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,455
Hold on.

293
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,606
Dude...

294
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,735
What the fuck was that?

295
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,295
That was pretty fucking funny.

296
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,535
Dude, no, but...
Maybe your grandma's right, dude.

297
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,686
Maybe that bitch is a <i>bruja.</i>

298
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,527
Well, hello, ladies.

299
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,455
Oh, man...
Let's stop messing with Chavo.

300
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,575
You're scaring him!
He doesn't like your Spanish music.

301
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,055
...drawing some symbol right on the girl.

302
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,535
- Yeah.
- With blood, I think.

303
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,815
It was like some red shit. We don't
know if it was blood or anything.

304
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,895
It looked like a ritual or something.

305
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,815
And the girl was...
I'm talking about... She was gone.

306
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,001
She's probably a pimp.

307
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,963
Like, you know,
she's running a whorehouse.

308
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,295
How's she gonna run a whorehouse?

309
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,845
- What about that one girl...
- That sounds stupid.

310
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,535
...who was, like, nine months pregnant?
She was about to pop.

311
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,335
Well, eventually,
if you work at a whorehouse,

312
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,615
you will eventually get pregnant!

313
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,335
You know what everybody says
around the hood, like,

314
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,335
that she's some <i>bruja</i>
or witch or whatever.

315
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,735
I mean, I believe it now.

316
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,455
And tell her about Oscar.
Remember how he...

317
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,135
- Oh, yeah, yeah...
- How does he know Ana?

318
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,095
I don't know.
That's what's weird to me.

319
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,690
- Eber!
- Come here.

320
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,080
Hey, listen, you want to do us a favor?

321
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,415
You know Ana, right?

322
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,363
This is gonna be priceless.

323
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,280
Hey, Eber.

324
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,695
Knock on her door loud.

325
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,335
Call her name.
Scream her name.

326
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,044
<i>Bruja!</i>

327
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,455
<i>Bruja!</i>

328
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,215
Oh, my God. What the fuck!

329
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,455
She said we don't know
what's gonna happen to me.

330
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,815
Hey, where'd you
get the firecracker from, anyways?

331
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,255
From my uncle, when he goes
to Mexico, he gets them in TJ.

332
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,520
That shit looks dope.

333
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,765
Back up a little bit more.

334
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,210
That shit's about to pop.

335
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,289
- Or not.
- Did that shit go out?

336
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,895
Boom!

337
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,255
What the fuck! Don't do that shit, man!

338
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,775
It's just not funny, man!
What if that shit would've...

339
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,325
What the fuck?

340
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,615
Shit!

341
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,010
Holy shit! Dude, that was Oscar!

342
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,615
Whoa... Whoa!

343
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,455
Holy shit!

344
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,847
- Oh, shit, look!
- Oh, fuck!

345
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,205
Oh, shit.

346
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,042
Look at all those people, man.

347
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,695
Please get back
to your apartments.

348
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,484
You two, please.
Inside, now.

349
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,735
Holy shit, dude.

350
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,975
Come on, guys.
Everyone upstairs.

351
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,295
Get that camera out.

352
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,695
- Did someone die?
- It's crazy.

353
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,695
I don't know...
I don't know what happened.

354
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,768
- Hide the shit.
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

355
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,009
- Yo, Hector!
- Yo!

356
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,135
Yo! I think he jumped
from Ana's apartment.

357
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,335
What?

358
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,204
Look. They're taking the body out! Look.

359
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,975
Goddamn!

360
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,440
Holy shit! That's Ana's body.

361
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,251
Be quiet.

362
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:36,289
That's so messed up.
I can't believe that's Ana.

363
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,975
They still haven't caught him?

364
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,335
I guess not.

365
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,975
That's so scary.

366
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,735
I just don't get
why Oscar would kill her.

367
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,655
I mean, he just graduated valedictorian.

368
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,055
- You guys talk to the cops?
- No.

369
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,415
- I ain't talking to the cops.
- Why would we talk to the cops?

370
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,055
And plus, his brother is,
like, the main head of 805.

371
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,575
I'm not messing with that gang stuff.

372
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,855
Snitches get stitches.

373
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,415
I don't even think he knew
the camera was there.

374
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,815
That's how fast it was.

375
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,335
You don't know that.

376
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,695
- You can't even tell it's him.
- You guys better erase it.

377
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,495
You saw him
coming out of her apartment!

378
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,015
Stop tripping! He didn't see the camera!

379
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,255
We're not gonna be showing people.

380
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,975
We haven't even shown anyone.
We're not gonna show people.

381
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,526
You better hope that I'm tripping.

382
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,415
- You're so stupid, dude.
- What?

383
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,124
Blow it out, fool.

384
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,801
Dude, blow that shit out!

385
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,135
Stop fucking spraying me!

386
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,006
That was crazy. Someone died
right underneath you, man.

387
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,615
Don't think about it.

388
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,415
She probably sleeps,
like, right under me.

389
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,615
Exactly!

390
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,935
So we're like this.

391
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,655
Come on. Don't choke.

392
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,001
Blaze one for the nation.

393
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,169
Rasta!
Rastafari!

394
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,455
Dude, man,
I'm still tripping about fucking Oscar.

395
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,575
Tell me about it.

396
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,975
Whatever the hell
was going on down there,

397
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,135
I wish I knew, dude.

398
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,455
She was probably
doing weirdass shit down there.

399
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,641
Hey.

400
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,640
I had an idea.

401
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,895
Let's go check that shit out, man.

402
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,055
What, the...

403
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,447
- Downstairs. Ana.
- For real?

404
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,055
Yeah, man.

405
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,535
Dude, I bet you could find,
like, clues and shit.

406
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,535
What do you think you are?
Sherlock Holmes? What the fuck?

407
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,655
Sherlock Homes!
You're Sherlock Homes!

408
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,935
Here, let me try to open the door.

409
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,485
Oh, it's sealed.

410
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,246
Hold it open.

411
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,168
Probably it's gonna be locked.

412
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,245
See, what did I tell you? It won't open.

413
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,086
I got an idea.

414
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,804
Don't make noise!

415
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,135
Hand me the camera.

416
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,735
- Oh, it's fuckin' open, man.
- Oh, shit.

417
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,975
Give it to me, hurry up.

418
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,843
Here, give me your hand.
Give me your hand.

419
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,655
Watch your step. Watch your step.

420
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,284
Turn on the light for me.

421
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,041
All right.

422
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,881
Oh, shit.

423
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,415
Shut the fuck up!

424
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,805
I know. My bad.

425
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,840
Why would she lock her fridge?

426
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,535
Fuck, what is this?

427
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,607
I don't know.

428
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,775
For old people peeing?

429
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,801
Hector, stop touching everything.

430
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,690
Hmm. It's garlic.

431
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,320
Stop touching everything.

432
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,129
- What is this thing?
- Okay, don't listen.

433
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,481
Hey, look.

434
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,240
There's Chavo with a grenade
in his mouth.

435
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,921
It's corn.

436
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,281
Yo.

437
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,326
I think that shit just moved.

438
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,363
- Go check it out.
- No, man. You go.

439
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,168
- Just go check it out.
- Dude, just fuck...

440
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,121
What is it?

441
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,241
What is it?

442
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,960
Dude!

443
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,655
Stop being such a dick, dawg.

444
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,735
Fuck.

445
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,240
She never took a shower either, fuck.

446
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,121
Oh, there's a spider right there.

447
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,361
Baby, it's all right.

448
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,921
What the fuck?

449
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,807
You hear that shit?

450
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,686
Yeah, be quiet.

451
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,881
Oh, shit.

452
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,365
Did she have a baby?

453
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,841
No. I don't think so.

454
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,285
Here, Hector. Get your phone.

455
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,929
Oh, fuck!

456
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,360
Scared the shit out of me.

457
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,001
What the fuck?

458
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,281
All that shit?

459
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,815
- Don't touch it, fool.
- Why?

460
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,360
Just don't touch it, man.
You don't know the shit she...

461
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,015
A bunch of old-school tapes.

462
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,088
See this? Dude.

463
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,409
"Katie and Kristi, 1988."

464
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,808
Let's just go check out
that last room.

465
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,401
Dude, it fucking stinks.

466
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,571
Oh, fuck!

467
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,375
Oh, shit, dude.

468
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,521
What is that? Is that blood?

469
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,775
Yes, <i>"vive. "</i>

470
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,535
- Check this shit...
- Don't get close to that shit.

471
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,561
Holy fuck!

472
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,045
There's blood everywhere.

473
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,761
Hold on.

474
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,811
What is it?

475
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,895
Some type
of journal or something.

476
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,855
Come on, dude,
let's just fucking go already.

477
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,609
All right, let's go.

478
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,287
- Holy shit!
- Oh, fuck!

479
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:33,121
What you guys doing here?
You heard that he did this shit.

480
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,855
That wasn't my little brother.

481
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,735
What about that bitch that used to stay
right here? You know about her?

482
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,015
Honestly,
we don't know shit, man.

483
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,415
We don't know anything.

484
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,329
Get the fuck out of here.

485
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,044
- Oh, fuck.
- Come on.

486
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,960
I can't believe you guys
stole this from her house.

487
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,844
Look, she has
a whole bunch of pictures.

488
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,285
What's that?

489
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,931
This looks dope.

490
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,535
What language is that?

491
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:01,485
They're basically saying
that if you build this door,

492
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,615
it's like, you could travel through time.

493
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,095
Man,
if she could travel through time,

494
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,095
why the hell is she staying
in this shitty-ass apartment?

495
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,455
I'd timeportal my ass
to the Bahamas or something.

496
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,055
No, it says <i>destinos profanos.</i>

497
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,935
Like, you could only go
to unholy places through this door.

498
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,775
- Unholy places.
- Oh, shit.

499
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,135
What's an unholy place?

500
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,375
How am I supposed to know?

501
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,295
I'm trying to get up
into Marisol's friend Espi's unholy place.

502
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,527
- Oh, you're so nasty, man.
- Dude, that's her cousin.

503
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,688
- Look at this.
- Can I see it?

504
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,815
Looks like some
medieval looking type of shit.

505
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,095
What is that?

506
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,455
It's a map. Scavenger hunt.

507
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,246
This is like what Ana
was painting on that naked chick.

508
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,055
That is.

509
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,535
Oh, shit.

510
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,369
Maybe this is the ritual
she was doing to her.

511
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,735
What's the <i>incubo?</i>

512
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,125
It's like a demon.

513
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,560
A demon?

514
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,080
Why couldn't we just
buy a black mirror?

515
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,323
Where the hell can you buy
a black mirror at?

516
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,325
That doesn't even make any sense.

517
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,335
- That's my boy.
- Man, shut up.

518
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,935
It's supposed to be like a doorway.

519
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,015
Like a portal.

520
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,041
Like a port?

521
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,935
Yeah, to the spirit world.

522
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,015
I better not fall off this shit.

523
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,246
The spirit world, what...

524
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,689
- Yeah.
- How do you even know this shit?

525
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,175
I looked it up, fool.

526
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,095
Grandma said we shouldn't be fucking
with that shit.

527
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,735
- Don't even worry about that.
- Oh, my gosh!

528
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,815
Just let it go.

529
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,095
We're just gonna fuck
around and then, you know...

530
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,121
Nothing's gonna happen.

531
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,001
Don't trip. You tie your shoes?

532
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,855
Why can't we just do this
at your apartment?

533
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,848
If my <i>abuelita</i> saw this shit...

534
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,687
She would flip out.
You know how superstitious she is.

535
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,445
Here, go in fast, but be quiet.

536
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,055
Are you sure nobody's
gonna catch us in here?

537
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,003
Yeah, I'm sure.
Go through this door right here.

538
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,535
Fuck!

539
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,055
See the chandelier?

540
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,162
That is dope. It looks crazy in the dark.

541
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,524
- It's so quiet.
- Let's do it right here.

542
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,170
Okay, I'm gonna put this down.

543
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,322
Did you hear that?

544
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,601
No.

545
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,361
I swear to God.

546
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,848
You're tripping.

547
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,135
So what are we supposed to do?

548
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,731
Make a triangle.
I'm gonna make it right here.

549
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,649
And then put a circle
in the middle and put the mirror...

550
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,966
Damn, that looks good.

551
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,001
- Yeah?
- It looks just like the drawing.

552
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,605
Over here.

553
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,602
After we say the spell,

554
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,695
then the portal's supposed to open up.

555
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,721
I don't know.

556
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,320
Is something supposed
to come through?

557
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,721
I don't know.

558
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,495
Is it gonna be floating around and shit?

559
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,735
Yo, that's gonna be dope.

560
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,761
Let's just do it...

561
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,481
Pshoo.

562
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,361
Pshh.

563
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,361
I'm gonna go, man.

564
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,135
- Nothing's happening.
- Why?

565
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,655
You're not giving it enough time.

566
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,681
- Just sit back down.
- Man, I'm hungry, man.

567
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,255
You guys have been...
You've been here forever.

568
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,335
You're being serious right now?

569
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,010
Totally. Later.

570
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,241
I'm leaving.

571
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,361
You'll never guess.

572
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,761
I'm never gonna guess?

573
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,641
No.

574
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,041
Lemme see.

575
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,650
I promise you there's
no point of, like, going on.

576
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,455
Like, you're not gonna guess who.

577
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,481
Why do you say that?

578
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,881
I'm just sayin'.

579
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,961
You think it's Hector?

580
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,601
I don't know.

581
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,410
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

582
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,601
Be quiet. Be quiet.

583
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,215
Where do you think he went?

584
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,921
I don't know.

585
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,771
Hey, Hector.

586
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,250
We know you're here.

587
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,441
Come out.

588
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,645
What the fuck was that?

589
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,761
Come on.

590
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,281
Here.

591
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,721
Hello?

592
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,811
Anybody in here?

593
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,161
Oh, shit.

594
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,161
Hello?

595
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,361
Anyone there?

596
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,329
Here, come here, come here.
Give me the light.

597
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,481
There's no one in there.

598
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,641
Go. go, go. Go!

599
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,321
Wait, wait, wait.

600
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,601
What?

601
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,201
We're really just gonna leave
our stuff there?

602
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,895
Fuck that. I'm not going back in there.

603
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,001
That was fucking crazy.

604
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,127
My heart is beating so fast.

605
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,521
Oh, shit.

606
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,170
Get up, fool. It's noon!

607
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,521
I'm too tired.

608
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,641
Get your lazy ass up.

609
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,321
Come on. You gotta go show
the world your face.

610
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,815
What?

611
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:34,162
Dude, I had the craziest
fucking dream last night.

612
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,642
I was at some farm
with, like, all these women.

613
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,810
Sounds like a good dream.

614
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,321
No, but they were old. Like real old.

615
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,920
I don't know. It's just weird though.

616
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,843
Oh, dude... Hey. You bleeding?

617
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,001
- What the...
- What?

618
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,575
Did you get your period last night?

619
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,615
What are you talking...

620
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,855
There's blood on your bed, fool.

621
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,881
Look.

622
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,041
Oh, what is that?

623
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,801
It looks like a...
Like a bite or something.

624
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:57,961
Did you bite yourself?

625
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,841
Why the fuck would I bite myself?

626
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,844
Dude, what's wrong with Chavo, man?

627
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,481
He's growling at you.

628
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,601
He don't like you anymore, man.

629
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,000
Are you kidding? He loves me.

630
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,531
Chavo? You love daddy.

631
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,721
Whoa!

632
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,561
What the...

633
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,001
What was that, man?

634
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,446
I don't know. Chavo!

635
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,935
He ain't feelin' you today, man.

636
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,761
They're hiring at my job
if you want to apply.

637
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,561
I'm not gonna flip signs like you.

638
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,815
Why not, man? It takes skill, man!

639
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,444
- I've been practicing this whole time.
- Skill.

640
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,085
I've been getting better.

641
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,806
What?

642
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,681
I'm hungry.

643
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,600
You have a dick on your face, fool.

644
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,201
What?

645
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:42,490
You have a dick on your cheek.

646
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,175
Saw how I drew pubes and everything?

647
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,123
- You're nasty...
- Hector, you asshole!

648
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,404
How long you guys had this?

649
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:59,575
I don't know.
Since, like, I was a little kid.

650
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,855
This is older... This is ancient.

651
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,615
Watch a pro do it now.

652
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:06,120
I'm like the master of this game.

653
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,402
All right. Here we go.

654
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,735
- Turn it on.
- It is on.

655
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,091
Hello!

656
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,771
Are you gonna work or not?

657
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,575
- Oh. There you go!
- Oh, there you go!

658
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,329
That was funny, you said,
"Are you gonna work or not?"

659
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,930
And it went "toot."

660
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,135
Man, you broke it, Hector.

661
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,935
I really think, like,
it thought you were so stupid

662
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,095
that it stopped working.

663
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,255
Shut up, man.

664
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,255
Do you think Hector is stupid?

665
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,575
Oh, do you think Hector is stupid?

666
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,415
Wait a sec. Is that a yes?
I think that's a yes.

667
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,215
It's not broken. Now it's my turn.

668
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,095
It's probably just coming on
every 30 seconds.

669
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:53,522
I'm gonna speak in the third person.
Is Jesse handsome?

670
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,295
Ask it something
that you know it'll say "no,"

671
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,095
to see if it only does green or what.

672
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,281
Okay. Um...

673
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,095
I can't believe we're actually like,
talking to this thing.

674
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,884
Is Hector black?

675
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,575
What?

676
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,761
This is crazy!

677
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,095
Now, watch it.

678
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,646
Am I holding the ace of hearts?

679
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,175
Holy shit!

680
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,375
- That's great!
- I could make money with this.

681
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,775
Do something else.

682
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,847
Show your grandma.

683
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,015
You think it understands Spanish? No.

684
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,335
Okay. Um...

685
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,330
Oh, shit.

686
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,135
Dude, why did she trip?

687
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,761
She thinks it's bad or something.

688
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,721
What the hell?

689
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,966
What's going on, Chavo?

690
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,921
Hello!

691
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,881
Hello!

692
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,761
Oh, shit.

693
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,325
- Jesse, take that off.
- Dad?

694
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,695
Yes, take the chain off.

695
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,815
What's going on?

696
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,375
- Were you here just like a minute ago?
- No.

697
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,215
How could I get in
when you have the chain on the door?

698
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,561
Getting home from work right now.

699
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,415
- You sure?
- Yes!

700
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,360
Put that away.
I don't want you waking up <i>abuela.</i>

701
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,895
- Come on. You know the bet.
- Shut up, man.

702
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,415
You are not
seriously gonna eat that.

703
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,441
It's not even that bad.

704
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,615
- That's so nasty.
- No, not those.

705
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,721
You gotta put the habanero.

706
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,001
How does it taste?

707
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,609
- He's loving...
- I told you. A bet's a bet.

708
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,695
For real?

709
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,360
- Wait for it.
- There it is. There it is.

710
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,601
<i>Agua!</i>

711
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,255
Do you have water? No <i>agua?</i>

712
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,281
Why are you talking like that?

713
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,695
Shut up, dick. It burns.
That's why. It burns my tongue.

714
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,767
Here you go.

715
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,051
Two? Where's the rest of the money?

716
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,208
- I said two. I didn't say 20.
- What?

717
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,165
So, I walked over and then
he was staring right out the front door.

718
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,407
And it was wide open.

719
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,681
The front door to the apartment?

720
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,135
Yeah. And everybody was asleep.
And my dad was at work, too.

721
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,207
Maybe it was Oscar.

722
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,415
- Would you stop saying that?
- You think?

723
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,575
Yeah, he's still out there.

724
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,655
No, don't say that, man.

725
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,495
What if he saw you guys tape him
and he's coming back for it?

726
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,841
Or trying to look for it or something?

727
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,415
But it didn't feel like
it could have been Oscar.

728
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,568
It feels like something's around me.

729
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,160
Like something's in my house.

730
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,975
- Like <i>el cucuy?
- El cucuy?</i>

731
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,206
No, I'm serious.

732
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,855
Is <i>el cucuy</i> there?

733
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,495
Like, have you ever felt
like something was watching you?

734
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,646
Yeah.

735
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,495
Oh, shit.

736
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,602
Please tell me that was not real.

737
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,885
- That is so...
- Oh, my God. Oh, fuck.

738
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,326
- What?
- Oh, shit.

739
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,975
- Oh! Are you serious?
- Are you serious?

740
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,729
I think I sharted.
I swear to God. I think I just sharted.

741
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:20,935
- No!
- Oh, my God.

742
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,015
Go, <i>cochino!</i> Get away from me.

743
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,041
Wait, did it go through?

744
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,375
- Oh, I think I can see it.
- Fuck.

745
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,606
Mirasol, come. Help me.

746
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,040
- No! What do you want me to do?
- I have to clean laundry.

747
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,361
What?

748
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,481
Is this all over the house?

749
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,961
Yeah.

750
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,121
Oh, man.

751
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,721
She's trying to protect the house.

752
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,211
It smells really bad, though.

753
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,361
Dad!

754
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,404
- What?
- She's getting it all over my room, too.

755
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:54,921
There is no bad spirit.

756
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,615
What did she do in your room?

757
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,735
She put all the vinegar
all over the bureau.

758
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,841
And you're encouraging her.

759
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,166
I'm not encouraging anything.

760
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,775
You're following her,
filming her doing everything.

761
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,165
Just let her do her thing.
Just let her do it.

762
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,487
Ooh.

763
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,291
Right here, about to play
some basketball.

764
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,080
I'm gonna show you how I ball 'em up.

765
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,368
See how my knee locked up?

766
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,575
Stop making excuses.

767
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,575
I'm not. This shit locks up, man.

768
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,170
It affects my jump shot
'cause there's a whole flow.

769
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,775
- How you like losing, again?
- Man, shut up!

770
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,485
I'm just tired 'cause I haven't eaten
since, like, lunchtime.

771
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,815
And it's not even fair, dawg.

772
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,855
You know I have scoliosis.

773
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,015
Scoliosis?

774
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,000
- You got change?
- Oh, I think I left it.

775
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,775
Yo. You have money on you?

776
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,415
No, fool.
I'm not gonna give you shit, either.

777
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:49,535
You still owe me 6 bucks
from when I bought you tacos.

778
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,881
- Just, like, give me $2.
- Hey. Oh, shit, dude.

779
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:56,449
- Let's go. Hurry up, dude.
- Stop tripping.

780
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,449
- Let's just go.
- Oh, fuck.

781
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,122
Careful. Don't point the camera at them.

782
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,015
- What's up?
- What's up, man?

783
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,610
You guys want to run twos?

784
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,095
Uh...

785
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,175
No, we were just leaving.

786
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,815
What you got in the backpack?

787
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,015
What?

788
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,415
What you got in the backpack?

789
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,855
Nothing, man. I don't have anything.

790
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,735
Come on.
Just chill, dawg. Just chill, man.

791
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,895
Let me check the backpack.

792
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,535
I don't have anything, man.
Can you just leave us alone?

793
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,015
- Give me the backpack!
- Hey!

794
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,735
Hey, man. Give me my backpack!

795
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:27,135
Dude, leave him alone!
What the fuck, man?

796
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,895
Shit! Hey!

797
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,127
Stop! Get the fuck
off him, man! Stop it!

798
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,975
Oh, shit! Oh, fuck!

799
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,735
Jesse! Jesse! Come on!

800
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:43,055
Get up, Jesse! Get up, dawg!

801
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,923
What the shit? What the fuck?

802
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,725
Dude, let's go!
Let's get the fuck out of here, man.

803
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:50,002
Jesse! Come on, dude, let's fucking go!

804
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,495
- Hey, the bike!
- What?

805
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,000
Fuck the bike, dude! Hurry up, man!

806
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,844
- You all right, dude?
- What happened?

807
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,975
Dude, let's fucking go. Shit!

808
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,895
What the fuck was that, man?

809
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,763
How the hell did you do that?

810
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,415
I don't know.

811
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,335
- I mean, I barely touched him.
- What happened?

812
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,015
Man, what are you talking about?
They flew through the air!

813
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,335
- That was crazy.
- They flew, dawg.

814
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:17,175
It wasn't even a knockout.
They fuckin' flew...

815
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,441
Yeah, but I just don't remember.

816
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,440
Ask it.

817
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,040
Hello?

818
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,169
Anybody there?

819
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,931
Anybody?

820
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:49,775
Oh, shit! Oh, shit.

821
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,451
Did you mess
those guys up at the park?

822
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,535
- That's crazy!
- Oh, shit!

823
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,608
Are you my guardian angel?

824
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,090
Are you good?

825
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,970
Are you good?

826
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,255
Dude! All right.
Here. Just get the camera!

827
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,361
All right, fool. Hold on.

828
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,655
Are you ready? All right, watch this shit.

829
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,175
Just watch! Here. You got me?

830
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,375
Yeah, I got you. What...

831
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,845
What are you doing?

832
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,415
What...

833
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:39,047
What the fuck?
Oh, shit! What the fuck?

834
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:41,375
- Do it again! Do it again!
- Check this shit out.

835
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,164
Go, go, go.

836
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:48,729
Oh, shit! Fucking shit! That is fucking...

837
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:55,090
Dawg, are you sure
you want to do this, man?

838
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,085
Oh, my God!

839
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:05,135
Fuck, dude! My turn, my turn!

840
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,415
- One...
- All right, wait.

841
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:08,124
Just do it! Two...

842
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,404
Three! Go!

843
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:13,281
Fuck!

844
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,135
- Yo, you okay?
- Shit!

845
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,162
- You all right?
- Oh, no. Not cool, man.

846
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:21,695
- Want me to lift you up?
- Why the fuck didn't it catch me?

847
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:22,881
All right, watch.

848
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,811
Oh, shit, dude.

849
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:27,775
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

850
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,175
- That was incredible!
- Oh, my God!

851
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,135
That was amazing!
You flew over me, dawg!

852
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,575
- How did you do that?
- You see how much air I got?

853
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:36,605
One, two, three.

854
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:45,455
Oh, shit! What the fuck?

855
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:47,095
You got to breathe in and breathe out.

856
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:49,521
What? That's insane, Jesse!

857
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:54,015
Oh, shit! Oh, my God!

858
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:56,520
- We almost got 400 views.
- Let me see.

859
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,169
Look, people are commenting on it.

860
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,415
"Oh, so fake." Man, what the...

861
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,335
"Wow, this looks totally real."

862
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:05,215
"Good job, dude.
What effects program..."

863
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,615
All the people who leave comments
are always so negative on this shit.

864
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:11,295
"This is just an illusion by someone
obviously seeking attention."

865
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,495
- Stupid.
- This is stupid, man.

866
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,975
They just sit in their basements
jacking off to R. Kelly videos all day.

867
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,495
I feel like, right now,
if I want to go do something, I can do it.

868
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,602
- Yeah...
- Like, do you get me?

869
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,855
- Yeah, it's all adrenaline.
- You saw how badass that was.

870
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,655
- How I just fell and, like...
- I know, man.

871
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,095
Okay, but that's what I'm saying.
I don't even know...

872
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,335
I don't even know, dude.

873
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:27,566
I just feel like
I could do anything right now.

874
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,655
Why do you have a bat in the backseat?

875
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,855
Dude, in this hood,
you never know, man.

876
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:34,326
Remember, I told you about
that crazy-ass burn at the gas station?

877
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,249
So you're gonna carry a bat on you?

878
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,695
- Oh, hey, check it out.
- What?

879
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:39,535
- Back up. Back up. Back up.
- What, the car?

880
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:41,130
Yes, the car, dude! What else?

881
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:43,129
Dude, we're definitely going inside.

882
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:45,015
Hell, yeah. Here.

883
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,175
Take my camera.
Just follow me.

884
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,575
They're gonna know
we're not invited.

885
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:48,721
You can't just walk up to...

886
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:56,095
I'm serious, man.

887
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:57,695
Some of these fools
look like criminals and shit...

888
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,135
- What?
- Not you, man.

889
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,815
Look at those girls.

890
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,375
Damn, she got a Kim Kardashian ass.

891
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,335
I just wanna ask you
if I could have a kiss on my cheek.

892
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,855
I made a bet with my friend, so...

893
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:06,961
A kiss on your cheek?

894
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,215
You mother...

895
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:12,735
Can I get a kiss on the cheek

896
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:13,935
- if I make you laugh?
- No.

897
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:16,884
The thing is, my cheek
is right above my testicles.

898
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:20,406
Oh, my God! Leave some for me!

899
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:29,855
We're taking them home!
Home, to my mom's!

900
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:32,770
My mom don't get back...
My mom falls asleep at 10 p.m., for real.

901
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,535
Hey, whoa, whoa.
This is my building.

902
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:38,575
Let's go.

903
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:41,171
Are you insane? I need my purse!

904
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:45,015
Hey, right here,
you have to be quiet, please.

905
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:50,015
Oh, shit. Okay, be quiet.

906
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:52,015
She's so cute!

907
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,655
Hey, why don't we just go to your spot?

908
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,695
Hell, no, man. There's like 50 people
that live up in there.

909
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:57,455
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

910
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:59,015
Oh, she's sleeping, dude. Can't we just...

911
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,805
Oh, I got an idea.
Take them to the courtyard.

912
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:04,335
Yes! Just take them to the courtyard.

913
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:06,488
What are we waiting for?

914
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:11,295
- Come.
- What?

915
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:16,329
Jesse. Dude, are you serious right now?

916
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,175
Are you sure we can be here?

917
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:20,615
We're good.
The lady moved out.

918
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:23,135
The lady that used to live here,
she got murdered.

919
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:25,375
- Shut up.
- Right here. I swear to God.

920
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,295
Come here, come here...

921
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:29,295
No, don't take the light away!

922
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:30,455
Just chill.

923
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:31,925
All right, dude.

924
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:38,531
Listen. I want to take Penelope
and I want to...

925
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,535
What am I gonna do
with the other one?

926
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:43,495
- The other one's not into me.
- She is.

927
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:46,975
Dude, at the party,
she kept staring at you. I swear.

928
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,655
She's trying to get away from me.

929
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,855
It's all right, dude. Fuck.

930
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,615
- Just do me a favor.
- What?

931
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,135
I don't know. Take her somewhere.

932
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,655
- Just give it to me.
- Okay, I'm gonna...

933
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,365
- I'm gonna take it... I'm hot.
- Are you serious?

934
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:01,175
- What are you wearing?
- I was hot.

935
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,215
He's trying to get sexy for you.

936
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:04,651
Penelope.

937
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:07,495
- Okay, goodbye. Mmm-hmm.
- You want to come?

938
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,095
Yes, okay, she's leading it.

939
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:10,495
You see what I'm talking about?

940
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:12,015
- Have fun!
- Bye-bye.

941
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:14,646
Slut!

942
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:38,571
Penelope?

943
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:40,965
Penelope?

944
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,731
Oh, my God.

945
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:51,009
I want you to fuck
the shit out of me, okay?

946
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:52,925
I'm serious.

947
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:55,895
- You're serious?
- Yes!

948
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,126
Okay.

949
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:04,567
I'm serious.
I want you to fuck me really, really hard.

950
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:09,605
All right.

951
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,735
You have a condom, right?

952
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:17,935
Uh...

953
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:20,122
Yeah. I'll be right back.

954
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,255
What do you mean, you'll be...

955
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,523
It's upstairs. Don't worry. I'll be back.

956
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:53,205
What the fuck is she talking about?

957
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,291
Hello?

958
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:20,567
Hector, stop messing around, man.

959
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,529
She put it inside me.

960
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:43,208
That's why I killed Ana.

961
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,165
She changed me.

962
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:49,655
And it's inside you, too, isn't it, Jesse?

963
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,444
You have the same mark.

964
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:57,164
The only way to stop it is to kill yourself.

965
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:01,249
Kill yourself before
you hurt someone, Jesse.

966
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:03,969
Jesse!

967
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,735
Oh, Jesse, he is here!

968
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,166
Oh, shit.

969
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:17,250
- What's going on?
- Where are the girls?

970
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:18,921
- They're inside.
- Call 911!

971
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:28,735
Where the fuck are you?

972
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:30,695
What the fuck's going on?

973
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:31,846
He was in Ana's!

974
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:35,442
- Who?
- Oscar!

975
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,684
Oh, my God!

976
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,643
- Oh, fuck! Fuck!
- Holy shit!

977
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,208
Oh, my God! Oh, shit!

978
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,968
Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

979
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:50,215
- You don't see his eyes? Look.
- Yeah.

980
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,095
- Go back.
- His eyes look all...

981
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:54,895
Look at his eyes.
They're all cracked out looking.

982
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:57,015
He died last night, man.
Ana got killed in there.

983
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,175
I'm not gonna go down there anymore.

984
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,415
Okay, well,
he had the same mark that I do.

985
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:02,480
He said whatever happened to him
is happening to me.

986
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:15,721
It's right there, you can see it.

987
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:17,724
I got it. Watch out.

988
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:21,085
Oh, shit.

989
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,326
Follow me.

990
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,520
- I'm gonna go in.
- Watch your step.

991
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:30,055
- I can't see shit.
- Close the door.

992
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:31,095
Why?

993
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:33,691
We're not supposed to
be down here. Just close it.

994
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:39,851
I can't see shit.

995
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:45,088
Here. Give me your phone.

996
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:46,935
Flashlight.

997
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,803
Come on. Follow me.

998
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:01,129
What is this place?

999
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:03,370
I don't know.

1000
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:15,970
Check it out.

1001
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,415
- Jesse.
- What?

1002
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:25,965
This is you.

1003
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,485
What the fuck?

1004
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,131
She had pictures of you.

1005
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:35,055
This is me when I was a baby.

1006
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:36,215
Oh, my God.

1007
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:37,615
My dad's been looking
all over the place for this.

1008
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:39,495
- This is my mom.
- What?

1009
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:40,695
This is when she was pregnant with me.

1010
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,688
- Shut up. That's Ana!
- No, it's not.

1011
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:45,975
Yes, that is. That's Ana!
Who's this white lady?

1012
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,731
"Lois. November 3rd, 1994."

1013
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:50,525
Oh, my God.

1014
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,415
What's my mom doing with Ana?

1015
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:53,965
Shit.

1016
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:57,327
And Oscar, too?
This shit's crazy!

1017
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:04,328
Dude, what is all this?

1018
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:11,926
There's somebody in here.

1019
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:22,090
They're in here.

1020
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:24,415
Look at me.

1021
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:25,930
I'm scared.

1022
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:36,935
Do you think
they know we're down here?

1023
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:38,041
Quiet.

1024
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:49,441
Come on.

1025
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:05,846
Back up, back up.

1026
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:56,481
Hector.

1027
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:01,521
Hector.

1028
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:13,641
I think they're gone.

1029
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:15,455
Yeah, okay.

1030
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:16,535
Let's go.

1031
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:17,561
Yeah, come on.

1032
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:18,761
Go ahead, Hector.

1033
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:29,647
What do you see?

1034
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:35,200
- She's still here?
- Yeah.

1035
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:40,841
It's a lady.

1036
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:42,760
- What?
- It's a lady.

1037
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:44,735
- It's a lady?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1038
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:46,444
- What is she doing here?
- I don't know.

1039
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:55,648
Oh, shit.

1040
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,855
- You think she's gone?
- I think she left.

1041
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,095
- She's gone?
- I think she left.

1042
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:04,321
- You sure she's gone?
- Yeah, she just closed the door.

1043
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:14,484
What did she look like?

1044
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:16,375
She was dressed in black,

1045
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,895
and she was like this tall,
just a white lady.

1046
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:21,127
- Is this Ana with Mom?
- Yeah.

1047
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:23,095
Where did you get this?

1048
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:24,935
It doesn't matter.
I just wanna how Ana knew Mom.

1049
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:28,169
Check out the picture.
Mom was pregnant there, with me.

1050
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:30,935
I mean, I heard stuff
from people saying that, like,

1051
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:33,167
Ana, like, she was doing
all this weird witch stuff,

1052
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:35,455
like, rituals on
pregnant women and stuff.

1053
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:38,051
How did Mom die? Having me, right?

1054
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,295
So what if Ana did something to Mom?

1055
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:42,695
You're tripping, dude.
Are you serious right now?

1056
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:45,295
Do you hear yourself?
You're just rambling on.

1057
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:48,335
You don't sleep, you don't eat.
I hear you get up at night.

1058
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:50,720
- What are you talking about?
<i>- Mijo,</i> I'm worried about you.

1059
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,365
What is that?

1060
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,161
What the fuck?

1061
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:40,015
What the hell?

1062
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:44,010
What the fuck?

1063
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:51,529
Jesse. You okay, <i>mijo?</i>

1064
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:55,409
Yeah, Dad. I'm fine.

1065
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,091
What the hell is happening to me?

1066
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:05,495
Arturo's a serious gangster.
What is he gonna do?

1067
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:07,455
He's gotta know something.

1068
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:09,575
- It's Oscar's brother.
- Why is he taking so long?

1069
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:11,807
Oh, shit, is that him?

1070
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:14,721
He's calling us.

1071
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:16,495
Don't touch nothing
when you get in there, all right?

1072
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:17,726
Okay.

1073
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:19,683
Mom's having a hard time
dealing with all this shit.

1074
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:22,575
She doesn't want nobody
moving his stuff.

1075
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:25,415
I noticed Oscar started acting
different about a month ago.

1076
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:27,010
He got real quiet.

1077
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:29,683
Stayed in his room all night.

1078
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:32,695
Then he started even
acting crazy with my mom,

1079
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:34,643
started breaking shit in the house.

1080
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:36,883
- Then I found this.
- Oh, shit.

1081
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:40,335
- Oh, fuck.
- Can we take a look at this?

1082
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:41,495
The last time I seen my brother,

1083
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:42,975
he said there was others like him.

1084
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,923
He said they were all marked.

1085
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:48,255
He said these witches were
trying to build an army or some shit.

1086
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:49,415
An army for what?

1087
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:51,455
These are all in different languages.

1088
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:52,655
From all over the world.

1089
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:54,175
It's all little kids?

1090
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:56,601
All little boys. First-born boys.

1091
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,055
Like you.

1092
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:00,481
- I'm the first-born.
- That's why...

1093
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:02,569
But Oscar was adopted.

1094
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:06,255
So what happened with his mom?

1095
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:09,255
She died at birth.
My mom and dad took him.

1096
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:11,295
That's like your mom, Jesse.

1097
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:12,367
Your mom?

1098
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:14,295
Yeah...

1099
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:15,775
His mom died while she was giving...

1100
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:17,484
Who's this girl?

1101
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:20,015
All these are boys,
and then there's this...

1102
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:21,495
Isn't Carlsbad near here?

1103
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:22,760
Yes, it's pretty close.

1104
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:25,089
"Ali Rey was..."

1105
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:27,009
- Wait, that's her!
- What is?

1106
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:30,761
That's her. It's Ali Rey.
It says "Ali Rey" in the article.

1107
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:32,295
Was he talking to her?

1108
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:33,845
- Do you know her?
- I have no idea.

1109
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:36,655
Thanks. We appreciate it, man.
We got to go.

1110
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:38,655
What are you doing?
We should check this stuff out, man.

1111
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:41,001
Come on. Let's just go. Thanks.

1112
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:44,162
- Jesse, what's wrong?
- Jesse...

1113
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:45,455
What's up with your boy, man?

1114
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:47,520
No, he's just going
through a lot right now.

1115
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:54,487
- Yo! Let's roll.
- Yeah. Sure.

1116
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:00,575
So what's up, dude?
What's wrong with you?

1117
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:01,855
Nothing, man.

1118
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:04,531
What do you mean, nothing?
Why'd you take off like that?

1119
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:08,335
I said, nothing, man. I'm fine.

1120
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:10,522
Was it the thing about the mom?

1121
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,880
Dude, Jesse, all that shit's exactly
what's been happening to you.

1122
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,215
All that stuff that Oscar was saying.

1123
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:17,335
No, it's not.

1124
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:18,771
Then how do you explain
all the crazy shit

1125
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:20,495
- that's been happening?
- Just back up, Hector.

1126
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:21,681
Please.

1127
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:23,975
No shit, man. You're the one
who told us to go to Arturo's.

1128
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,207
You don't want to talk about it now?

1129
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,570
What's wrong?

1130
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,041
Jesse.

1131
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:33,440
Dude, Jesse.

1132
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:35,289
Is this guy bothering you?

1133
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:38,444
What? No. This is Pablo.

1134
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:41,735
- Is this your boyfriend?
- He's a friend from high school.

1135
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:43,091
No.

1136
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,410
Jesse, what's up?

1137
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:49,295
- Jesse, what's wrong with you?
- Yeah, what's...

1138
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:51,607
- What's your problem, man?
- Jesse.

1139
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:55,695
Jesse, calm down.

1140
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:57,768
- Just chill out.
- Dude, calm down.

1141
01:02:58,240 --> 01:02:59,695
Did you not fucking hear me?
I said get out of here!

1142
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:01,095
Dude, Jesse. What the fuck, dude?

1143
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:02,770
He's not doing anything to me.
Just calm down.

1144
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:04,255
What the fuck
you looking at me like that for, huh?

1145
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:05,855
Jesse, dude... Hey!

1146
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:07,095
- Jesse, don't...
- Dude, calm the fuck down.

1147
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:08,175
Are you serious right now?

1148
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:10,215
Yeah, I'm serious.
Do I look like I'm fuckin' playing?

1149
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:13,255
Jesse, dude, let's fucking go.
What are you doing, man?

1150
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:17,055
Hey, Jesse, what the fuck, dude?
Just leave him alone!

1151
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:19,335
- Back up, all right?
- You, get out of here!

1152
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:21,175
- What are you doing?
- What are you gonna do, huh?

1153
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:22,645
You all right, man?

1154
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:25,095
Hey, Jesse, what the fuck?

1155
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:26,695
Get out of here, now!

1156
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:27,926
What the fuck are you gonna do, huh?

1157
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:30,088
- Jesse!
- Back up, I said!

1158
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:32,575
Why don't you fucking hit me right here
if you're gonna fucking hit me?

1159
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:33,735
Leave, now!

1160
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:35,095
Marisol, what the fuck's he doing?

1161
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:36,415
- Hey!
- Jesse, stop it!

1162
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:37,895
- Come on, let's go! He's got a bat!
- Jesse!

1163
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:39,255
Come on, man! Jesse!

1164
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:43,365
Jesse! What the fuck!
What are you doing? Jesse!

1165
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:45,535
Hey, man!
What the fuck's wrong with you?

1166
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:47,255
- Come out, motherfucker!
- Let's go home!

1167
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:49,375
- Why don't you come out?
- Jesse! Jesse!

1168
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:50,975
He's gonna call the fucking cops! Go!

1169
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,455
Yeah, I'm getting the cops!

1170
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:54,289
Jesse, let's go. Come on.

1171
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,367
I've been texting you
all morning, man. What's up?

1172
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:00,211
You okay?

1173
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:02,646
Yeah, I'm fine.

1174
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:04,605
Like last night.

1175
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:07,284
I couldn't control myself.

1176
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:12,722
And a lot of times
I feel like I'm losing time. I can't...

1177
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:13,895
I don't know what I'm doing.

1178
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:15,809
All the stuff before, man...

1179
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:20,491
It was fun, you know?

1180
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,526
I felt like
maybe I was special or something.

1181
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:26,600
But not anymore.

1182
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,135
I'm telling you,
it's not gonna work again.

1183
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:30,889
You can just try it.

1184
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:32,815
Ask it something.

1185
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:34,695
- It worked last time, right?
- Yeah.

1186
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:36,400
What makes you think
it's gonna work twice?

1187
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:42,090
Are you there?

1188
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:47,369
I said, are you there?

1189
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:51,895
I told you.

1190
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:53,455
Dude, try something else, man.

1191
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:56,165
Is there something you want from me?

1192
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:08,529
I want you to leave me alone!

1193
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:13,363
I said, leave me alone!

1194
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:18,042
Just leave me alone! Now!

1195
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:43,721
You think it's gone?

1196
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:03,365
Chavo?

1197
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:39,095
What the hell?

1198
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:40,281
Chavo!

1199
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:43,281
Chavo?

1200
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:54,001
Chavo!

1201
01:06:57,360 --> 01:06:58,486
Oh, shit!

1202
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:02,960
Oh, shit.

1203
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:07,802
Okay, Chavo, I'm coming.

1204
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:12,488
I better turn on my light.

1205
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:14,241
Okay.

1206
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:26,041
Chavo?

1207
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:28,961
Chavo!

1208
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:55,686
Oh, fuck!

1209
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:58,530
Help!

1210
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:00,335
Help!

1211
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:03,726
Help!

1212
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:05,801
Help!

1213
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:08,291
Oh, shit!

1214
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:14,890
He's ready for you.

1215
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:49,248
What the fuck is that?

1216
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:53,725
What the fuck?

1217
01:08:58,240 --> 01:08:59,446
Jesse.

1218
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:10,284
What's wrong with you?
And what the fuck is that on your wall?

1219
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:16,255
Dude, Jesse,
why are you ignoring me, man?

1220
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:17,770
You're my best friend.

1221
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:19,609
We're not best friends.

1222
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:23,455
Okay? Do you get it?

1223
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:25,215
- Give me my camera.
- Dude...

1224
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:27,095
Just give me my camera.

1225
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:28,884
What's wrong with you?

1226
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:35,855
What are you doing, man?
Just stop, dude.

1227
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:37,455
Say something interesting.

1228
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:39,775
- Get this shit out of my face.
- What, you don't like this?

1229
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:41,131
Stop, man.

1230
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:44,845
- What the fuck's wrong?
- I don't need that anyway.

1231
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:48,487
Maybe that could be your best friend.

1232
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:54,455
What did he tell you when you saw him?

1233
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:56,403
I told you, he didn't say anything.

1234
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:59,849
He didn't even act like I was there.
He just walked out and left.

1235
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:01,455
I don't know.
I'm worried about him.

1236
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:03,005
Who are you calling?

1237
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:07,855
You took this?

1238
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:10,167
What are you gonna say?
Hello?

1239
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:14,855
You think that's her?

1240
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:16,006
I don't know.

1241
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:19,975
- Ali?
- Hi! Nice to meet you.

1242
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,135
Hey! I'm Hector.

1243
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:22,735
Do you guys recognize that?

1244
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:24,895
Yeah, that was in Oscar's room.

1245
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:26,055
That's the sign of The Midwives.

1246
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:27,535
- They're a coven.
- What?

1247
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:28,695
- A coven?
- Yeah.

1248
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:29,895
Like of...

1249
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:30,975
Witches.

1250
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,207
- That mark right there...
Mmm-hmm.

1251
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:38,204
The Midwives will mark
an unborn male in utero.

1252
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:40,722
And then they wait
for the baby to mature

1253
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:42,295
until he's ready to be possessed.

1254
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:43,655
But why now?

1255
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:46,415
Like, if Jesse, our friend,
was marked at birth,

1256
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:49,535
why would the demon come now
and try to possess him?

1257
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:54,566
Okay, you ready? Your friend, Jesse,
I'm assuming he's 18?

1258
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:56,695
Yeah.

1259
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:58,895
And the other kid? Your friend?

1260
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:00,922
Oscar? I think so.

1261
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:04,365
Add them up.

1262
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:07,123
This transformation, it's like...

1263
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:09,615
It's like when you have
an infection in your body.

1264
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:11,449
So he's fighting it off.

1265
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:15,775
They'll perform a final ritual,
and then he'll go back to normal.

1266
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:18,644
But he won't...
He won't be Jesse anymore.

1267
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:29,845
Uh-huh.

1268
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:33,201
What? Slow down.
I don't understand you.

1269
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:35,044
What?

1270
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:47,130
Dude? Jesse!

1271
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:51,481
Jesse?

1272
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:55,529
What are you doing, man?

1273
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:04,095
What the... Jesse!
Jesse, stop! Jesse! Stop!

1274
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:06,295
Put him down, man!
You're gonna hurt him!

1275
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:09,455
Dude, what the fuck are you doing?

1276
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:11,244
Let him go, Jesse! Stop!

1277
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:12,975
Shit, you're hurting him, man!

1278
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,890
What the fuck you doing?
Jesse! Stop it, man!

1279
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:28,335
She's telling him?

1280
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:31,603
She's talking about Jesse.
That he has a bad spirit in him.

1281
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:33,615
And she needs his help.

1282
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:35,535
- What'd he say?
- He said, "Cleansing."

1283
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:37,688
- Should we...
- Let's go. Come.

1284
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:46,046
Dude, this place is a trip.

1285
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:57,088
Jesus Christ.

1286
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:35,371
Jesse.

1287
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:41,564
Eggs are supposed to help him.

1288
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:37,802
Jesse! What the fuck? Shit!

1289
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:39,843
What the fuck? Jesse!

1290
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:42,123
What's wrong, Jesse?

1291
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:44,655
Are you okay?

1292
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:47,047
Jesse, what the fuck
is happening, man?

1293
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:49,761
Fucking shit! What the fuck?

1294
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:53,575
Jesse, are you all right?

1295
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:56,285
Damn it!
Stand back! Get back!

1296
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:57,935
What happened to the lights?

1297
01:14:57,960 --> 01:14:59,769
Just shut up!

1298
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:11,643
I can't see anything.

1299
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:24,175
Just stay back, all right?

1300
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:26,168
Just stay right there.

1301
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:43,895
Oh, shit!
Oh, my God, what happened?

1302
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:47,208
- What was that?
- I don't know. Fuck.

1303
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:49,523
Jesus Christ. Oh, shit.

1304
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:56,527
Fuck. What the fuck was that?

1305
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:12,091
Just hold on. Just stay right there.

1306
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:49,126
Jesse?

1307
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:51,880
Jesse?

1308
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:55,401
Jesse?

1309
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:57,570
- Is he okay?
- Yeah.

1310
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:27,735
What happened?
I thought it worked.

1311
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:34,808
He's gonna be okay, though, right?

1312
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:44,775
Hey, I think your grandma's
running the tub, man.

1313
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:46,255
I think she's gonna put you in there.

1314
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:47,645
It'll cool you down, all right?

1315
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:54,602
All right, don't worry about it.
Everything's gonna be cool.

1316
01:17:58,920 --> 01:18:00,001
Irma?

1317
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:09,841
Irma?

1318
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:17,888
Oh, shit.

1319
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:21,404
Oh, fuck!

1320
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:24,241
Jesse?

1321
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:29,881
Irma?

1322
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:39,840
Irma?

1323
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:42,926
Irma?

1324
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:51,681
Jesse?

1325
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:54,770
What the fuck?

1326
01:18:56,840 --> 01:18:58,080
Jesse.

1327
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:02,885
Jesse.

1328
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:09,403
Jesse, you all right, man?

1329
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:12,205
Jess...

1330
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:19,768
Oh, fuck! Irma! Irma!

1331
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:22,686
Irma!

1332
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:25,690
Someone call 911! Call 911!

1333
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:29,375
- Where did he go?
- I don't know.

1334
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:30,695
I went to go call 911,

1335
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:32,535
and when I came back, he was gone.

1336
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:34,535
He didn't call or text you?

1337
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:36,495
No, I've been looking everywhere.
He's gone.

1338
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:38,522
They just moved her to the ICU.

1339
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:41,769
So I'm gonna go to the hospital
to be with my dad.

1340
01:19:42,040 --> 01:19:43,335
Uh-huh.

1341
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:44,850
Okay, but...

1342
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:47,927
I don't know. He just disappeared.

1343
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:49,121
What?

1344
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:52,895
- She said this is where Jesse is.
- What?

1345
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:56,402
Ali said this is a house
where they do a final ritual,

1346
01:19:56,520 --> 01:19:57,575
and that's where he's gonna be.

1347
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:59,762
Is she sure?
We should call the cops.

1348
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:02,288
Call the cops
and tell them what, Hector?

1349
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:03,575
They're not gonna believe us.

1350
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:05,215
We can't just fucking show up
at this house, Marisol!

1351
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:07,535
We're gonna go walk in? These people
are dangerous. They kill people.

1352
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:08,575
- Are you crazy?
- Well, I don't know.

1353
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:10,415
We'll get help or something!
We can't just leave him there!

1354
01:20:10,440 --> 01:20:12,895
We can't just leave our friend, Hector!
We have to go!

1355
01:20:12,920 --> 01:20:14,455
Stop. All right, look.

1356
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:16,615
We're going to the hospital, all right?
I'm gonna tell his dad everything.

1357
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:17,880
I'm gonna show him the footage.

1358
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:19,455
So are we
not gonna talk about this?

1359
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:20,855
What's there to talk about, Marisol?

1360
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:24,168
- What are we gonna do?
- I'm gonna... I'm telling his dad.

1361
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:25,735
What is his dad gonna do?

1362
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:28,415
Well, what are we doing? We don't
even know what the fuck we're doing.

1363
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:29,615
I'm just saying...

1364
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:31,563
What the fuck is wrong with the car?

1365
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:34,122
Are you fucking kidding me?

1366
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:37,735
- Are you serious?
- I just fixed this.

1367
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:39,615
What's wrong with it?

1368
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:41,688
I just got this shit fixed.

1369
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:43,086
Fuck!

1370
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:45,455
Goddamn.

1371
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:55,323
What the fuck!
Turn that thing off! Turn it off.

1372
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:57,215
Jesus Christ, Hector!
What the fuck was that?

1373
01:20:57,240 --> 01:20:58,880
I don't know!
It just turned on by itself!

1374
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:01,680
What the fuck, Hector?

1375
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:05,883
The fuck?

1376
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:09,010
Oh, my God.

1377
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:10,851
Is that Jesse?

1378
01:21:11,320 --> 01:21:12,890
Now start the car.

1379
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:17,127
Fuck!

1380
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:19,722
- Shit, he's coming this way.
- Oh, shit.

1381
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:24,735
Come on, let's just get out.
Let's just get out.

1382
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:27,206
- The door is stuck.
- What's this guy doing?

1383
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:29,615
What the fuck...
What the fuck is happening?

1384
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:31,895
- Shit!
- Oh, this is insane!

1385
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:36,775
Where the fuck...
Where the fuck did he go?

1386
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:42,404
Oh, shit.

1387
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:51,486
Oh, shit.

1388
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:53,570
Where'd he go?

1389
01:22:04,760 --> 01:22:06,091
Where'd he go?

1390
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:08,640
Hector! Hector! Oh, my God!

1391
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:10,775
Stop, Jesse!

1392
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,367
No, Jesse, stop it!

1393
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:20,326
Stop!

1394
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:24,089
Oh, my God!

1395
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:28,615
He's not moving, Hector!
He's not moving!

1396
01:22:28,640 --> 01:22:30,055
- Stop yelling right now!
- What are we gonna do?

1397
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:31,935
No, he's fine. He'll be fine.

1398
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:33,935
His eyes
were all black and shit!

1399
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:35,575
I don't know if he's breathing!

1400
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:37,568
Hector, what the fuck are we gonna do?

1401
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:39,415
He's not moving!

1402
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,286
Oh, my God.

1403
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:54,055
- Oh, my God.
- You okay?

1404
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:55,695
Oh, my God! Oh, Shit!

1405
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:57,455
- What?
- They took him!

1406
01:22:57,480 --> 01:22:58,735
- They took him!
- Jesse!

1407
01:22:58,760 --> 01:23:00,935
Hector, they took Jesse!

1408
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:02,935
They took Jesse and they're gone!
They took Jesse!

1409
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:04,769
- Get in the car!
- Shit!

1410
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:06,775
Oh, fuck.

1411
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:09,001
Fuck.

1412
01:23:11,960 --> 01:23:14,455
Arturo! Arturo!

1413
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:15,535
Are they home?

1414
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:16,975
- Hey, is Arturo here?
- Hey, what the fuck...

1415
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:18,055
We need to talk to him.

1416
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:19,815
Tell him it's an emergency.

1417
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:21,735
- We need your help, man.
- What do you mean?

1418
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:22,975
They took Jesse!

1419
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:24,655
Jesse... Jesse...
What do you mean, they took him?

1420
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:26,842
They took Jesse!
The women! They took him!

1421
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:30,245
This is a bad idea.
I can't believe we're doing this.

1422
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:34,761
Slow down. I think this is it.

1423
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:37,123
You sure this is the place?

1424
01:23:37,960 --> 01:23:39,530
Yeah. Yeah. This is it.

1425
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:50,842
Let's go smoke these bitches.

1426
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:00,280
Crack that shit open, Santo.

1427
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:17,009
Where the fuck we at?

1428
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:22,601
What?

1429
01:24:23,240 --> 01:24:25,242
That was me. That was me.

1430
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:44,815
- What was that?
- What?

1431
01:24:44,840 --> 01:24:47,081
I thought I just saw something.

1432
01:24:48,240 --> 01:24:49,775
It's locked.

1433
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:51,529
- It's locked?
- Yeah.

1434
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:06,680
This way.

1435
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:23,880
- Down this side, something.
- All right.

1436
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:30,175
Think anyone's here?

1437
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:31,655
- You see anything?
- Nah.

1438
01:25:53,400 --> 01:25:55,084
This shit's locked, too.

1439
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:57,760
Let me try this shit, homes.
Just give me a minute.

1440
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:36,641
Shit.

1441
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:38,526
Oh, fuck.

1442
01:26:57,520 --> 01:26:59,602
- Do you see anything?
- No.

1443
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:03,088
Santo. Santo.

1444
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:04,964
I almost got it.

1445
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:06,806
Let's go.

1446
01:27:32,360 --> 01:27:33,885
What the fuck?

1447
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:36,601
What is it?

1448
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:38,735
Looks like some food or something.

1449
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:40,922
Are they cooking shit?

1450
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:44,447
Think there's, like, squatters in there?

1451
01:27:44,920 --> 01:27:46,445
I don't know.

1452
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:48,604
You see anything?

1453
01:27:54,720 --> 01:27:56,415
I don't think anybody's here.

1454
01:27:56,440 --> 01:27:58,215
- You have to help me!
- - Holy shit!

1455
01:27:58,240 --> 01:27:59,295
Help me, please!

1456
01:28:02,440 --> 01:28:04,283
Fuck! Oh, shit!

1457
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:06,095
Watch out!

1458
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:09,335
Oh, my God!

1459
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:11,522
Get the fuck out of here! Go! Go!

1460
01:28:11,640 --> 01:28:12,775
Get out of here! Run!

1461
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:14,962
- Oh, shit!
- Run! Go, go, go!

1462
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:17,895
Go, go, go! Shit! Holy shit, Santo!

1463
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:21,295
Help me move him!
Help me move him!

1464
01:28:21,320 --> 01:28:23,575
Go! Close the door! Go!

1465
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:31,528
Come on! Come on! Come on!

1466
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:42,364
They're fucking everywhere!
Oh, shit!

1467
01:28:44,840 --> 01:28:46,729
- What the fuck is that?
- What?

1468
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:48,650
Just stay there, all right?

1469
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:53,125
Oh, my God.

1470
01:28:53,960 --> 01:28:55,121
Jesus.

1471
01:28:56,960 --> 01:28:58,883
Oh, God!

1472
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:01,165
Marisol?

1473
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:03,520
Marisol?

1474
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:05,560
Marisol!

1475
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:10,361
Hector.

1476
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:14,009
Hector. Right here.

1477
01:29:20,840 --> 01:29:23,002
- Help me.
- Is that Arturo?

1478
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:26,208
What the fuck is that?

1479
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:38,442
Oh, God! Fuck, fuck!

1480
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:40,975
Marisol! Where are you?

1481
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:45,522
Where the fuck are you?

1482
01:29:46,680 --> 01:29:47,886
Marisol?

1483
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:55,046
Fuck.

1484
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:02,731
Marisol.

1485
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:07,160
Oh, shit!

1486
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:13,922
Where the fuck are you?

1487
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:30,487
Marisol! Oh, my God!

1488
01:32:12,240 --> 01:32:14,242
Oh, oh, shit!

1489
01:32:14,600 --> 01:32:16,250
Oh, God!

1490
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:20,815
Oh, fuck! Shit!

1491
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:25,364
Fuck! Fuck!

1492
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:30,121
Fuck!

1493
01:32:36,840 --> 01:32:39,535
What the fuck? What the fuck is that?

1494
01:32:39,560 --> 01:32:40,891
Hector?

1495
01:32:49,320 --> 01:32:50,535
Hector, please open the door.

1496
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:52,642
Go away!
Get the fuck out of here!

1497
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:55,567
Hector, I'm scared, man.
Please open the door.

1498
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:57,855
Fuck you!
I'm not opening this door!

1499
01:33:00,040 --> 01:33:03,295
Jesse! Stop! Jesse!

1500
01:33:12,240 --> 01:33:14,641
Where the fuck am I? Oh, shit.

1501
01:33:59,480 --> 01:34:00,641
Hello?

1502
01:34:01,120 --> 01:34:02,326
Hello?

1503
01:34:06,760 --> 01:34:08,125
Excuse me.

1504
01:34:20,200 --> 01:34:21,361
Hello?

1505
01:34:23,640 --> 01:34:25,005
Excuse me.

1506
01:34:27,680 --> 01:34:29,682
Excuse me, lady, please.

1507
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,287
I don't know where I am. Please!

1508
01:34:33,680 --> 01:34:36,126
Excuse me. I need your help, please.

1509
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,575
Micah! Micah!

1510
01:34:43,880 --> 01:34:46,360
What's the matter?
Where are you?

1511
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:49,290
What the fuck?

1511
01:34:50,305 --> 01:35:50,252
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
