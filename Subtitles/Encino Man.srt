Stanley, is that...
Will you put that back?

18
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,741
- Ummm.
- Put that back!

19
00:04:01,836 --> 00:04:04,837
Hey, I just washed all this stuff.

20
00:04:04,964 --> 00:04:06,873
- It's my gear.
- Sorry, man.

21
00:04:06,966 --> 00:04:09,422
- It's okay.
- What's my mom screaming about?

22
00:04:09,511 --> 00:04:13,009
She's bummed
'cause I snaked your last bagel.

23
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:17,469
- Grab a shovel, man.
- No, I just wanna munch.

24
00:04:17,602 --> 00:04:19,476
You don't wanna help,
that's just fine.

25
00:04:19,604 --> 00:04:24,480
- Uh-huh.
- This is a total waste of time.

26
00:04:24,609 --> 00:04:28,737
Dave, be more of a geek.
There's no way you're going to the prom.

27
00:04:28,821 --> 00:04:30,979
- You're a disease.
- Ahh.

28
00:04:31,115 --> 00:04:34,402
- And no one will ever swim
in this stupid pool.
- Hey!

29
00:04:34,494 --> 00:04:36,071
Later.

30
00:04:36,162 --> 00:04:40,540
Look, David, please do me a favour
and stress less, bro.

31
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:42,576
High school is over, buddy.

32
00:04:42,668 --> 00:04:45,504
Get into it.
We're losers.

33
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:48,880
I've decided something, Stoney. I wanna
look back on my high school career,

34
00:04:49,008 --> 00:04:52,378
and think that I started slowly
but I finished strong, you know?

35
00:04:52,512 --> 00:04:55,383
High school's almost over and
I don't have anything to show for it.

36
00:04:55,515 --> 00:04:58,966
I know, me neither.
You should be stoked though, buddy.

37
00:04:59,101 --> 00:05:02,306
You got through the last four years
without the full-on melon tweekage.

38
00:05:02,397 --> 00:05:06,643
It's not enough. I mean,
I want my own page in the yearbook.

39
00:05:06,776 --> 00:05:11,439
Jump off the gym, splatter on the street
and go for the co-ver.

40
00:05:11,531 --> 00:05:15,315
It's not funny. I'm not goin' down
as this geek kid from Encino.

41
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:19,574
When I finish this pool, I'm gonna
have the killer party after the prom.

42
00:05:19,705 --> 00:05:24,166
I'm gonna be the prom king!
And I'm gonna graduate a legend.

43
00:05:25,878 --> 00:05:28,417
Well, what about me?

44
00:05:28,548 --> 00:05:31,169
Oh, well, you'll be there too.

45
00:05:31,301 --> 00:05:37,006
Thanks, but Robyn Sweeney, she's not
goin' to the prom with you, man.

46
00:05:37,098 --> 00:05:40,680
- I wish she would but she's not.
- What are you talkin' about?

47
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:43,135
Robyn Sweeney is mine.

48
00:05:43,229 --> 00:05:45,684
She's become a major babe
and she loves me.

49
00:05:45,773 --> 00:05:48,774
- She finds you crusty, Dave.
- I'll convince her.

50
00:05:48,901 --> 00:05:52,354
- She'll see the truth.
- Truth is...

51
00:05:52,489 --> 00:05:55,857
life's about greasin' the do-back,
buddy, and weasin' on the buffest.

52
00:05:55,992 --> 00:05:58,068
High school was interesting, right,

53
00:05:58,202 --> 00:06:01,370
but it was kind of
like a harsh ride. O-o-o-ow.

54
00:06:01,498 --> 00:06:03,703
We're goin' on to bigger
and better things, buddy.

55
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:07,202
Stoney, I am on to
bigger and better things.

56
00:06:09,255 --> 00:06:12,459
Count on it!

57
00:06:25,314 --> 00:06:27,222
Oh, wow!
Hey, what's up?

58
00:06:27,316 --> 00:06:30,897
- ♪ I'm a stoney crusty dude ♪
Did you know that?
- Get out, dude.

59
00:06:31,027 --> 00:06:33,814
- ♪ I got a mop on top ♪
- Watch out!

60
00:06:33,946 --> 00:06:38,526
Excuse me. Could you move. Me and
my friend, David, are comin' through.

61
00:06:38,618 --> 00:06:41,702
- Hey, there's Robyn.
- Hey, Robyn. O-o-o-ow!

62
00:06:48,711 --> 00:06:51,914
Four-wheelin' over the ferns.

63
00:06:52,048 --> 00:06:55,832
Look, Dave, you're gonna have to mellow
out, bro, on this whole Robyn thing.

64
00:06:55,968 --> 00:06:59,469
- She always shines ya.
- You don't understand. We have history.

65
00:06:59,597 --> 00:07:03,760
You had pre-freshman history.
You could've had her back then.

66
00:07:03,893 --> 00:07:07,178
She hadn't hit ""babehood"" yet.

67
00:07:07,314 --> 00:07:10,764
Milk does a body good.
Check her.

68
00:07:10,858 --> 00:07:13,230
She's clean, buddy,

69
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,356
and he's got her.

70
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:19,609
Matt Wilson?
What a jerk.

71
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,907
What does she see in him anyway?

72
00:07:21,994 --> 00:07:26,039
He's got the buff spikes
chillin' on top of his melon.

73
00:07:26,165 --> 00:07:28,786
Dude, he's checkin' her cheeks. Ohh!

74
00:07:28,876 --> 00:07:34,215
He's got the serious beak, his own
personal... oh! Holding company,

75
00:07:34,341 --> 00:07:36,334
full of fundage, bro,

76
00:07:36,468 --> 00:07:41,888
- that he weases off of ma...
- Jor.

77
00:07:42,014 --> 00:07:44,173
- Eighteen inch bi's.
- Bye-bye.

78
00:07:44,309 --> 00:07:46,217
Mine are only four.

79
00:07:46,353 --> 00:07:48,226
Besides that.

80
00:07:48,355 --> 00:07:50,263
He walks like this, right?

81
00:07:50,357 --> 00:07:54,485
Just like this, the nugs fully loose.

82
00:08:05,788 --> 00:08:08,160
Hi, Matt.

83
00:08:09,376 --> 00:08:11,249
Hi, Matt.

84
00:08:11,378 --> 00:08:13,454
All right, everybody.
Quiet, please.

85
00:08:13,547 --> 00:08:16,749
Settle down, quiet.
We're gonna start this week's class...

86
00:08:16,882 --> 00:08:18,756
same place we ended last week's class.

87
00:08:18,884 --> 00:08:21,341
That's talking about prehistoric man
in the what?

88
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:24,098
Prehistoric man in the...?
Oh, Stoney?

89
00:08:24,223 --> 00:08:28,137
- Ice Age.
- Yes, lce Age. Right, the lce Age.

90
00:08:28,227 --> 00:08:31,181
Why do we call it the lce Age?
'Cause there was a lot of ice.

91
00:08:31,272 --> 00:08:34,688
What do we call these big chunks of ice,
those big slabs of ice?

92
00:08:34,775 --> 00:08:37,398
- We called what? What do we call them?
- Glaciers.

93
00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:40,862
Right. You are paying attention.
That's good.

94
00:08:40,948 --> 00:08:44,033
These glaciers,
as they moved down our way,

95
00:08:44,118 --> 00:08:47,985
they're so heavy, cold and thick
that they freeze the ground water...

96
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,034
- and they form underground...?
- Glaciers.

97
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:55,704
Right. Believe it or not, some
scientists believe there are actual...

98
00:08:55,838 --> 00:08:58,874
underground glacial movements
still in this part of the world.

99
00:08:58,966 --> 00:09:01,125
You know what I think that is,
class?

100
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:04,712
- Lame!
- Exactly. Bunco, bogus.

101
00:09:04,847 --> 00:09:07,469
Listen, please remember...

102
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,720
that most of this hemisphere,
including the ground I'm walking on,

103
00:09:10,853 --> 00:09:13,059
all of this was under ice at some point,
so I guess...

104
00:09:13,189 --> 00:09:15,894
finding something frozen,
dug up here or there,

105
00:09:15,983 --> 00:09:18,142
wouldn't be that uncommon
when you think about it.

106
00:09:18,277 --> 00:09:22,227
So moving right along
on your journey of knowledge,

107
00:09:22,324 --> 00:09:25,574
- Let me show you Cro-Magnon Man.
- Woo!

108
00:09:25,701 --> 00:09:28,407
He's dope.
I'd go out with him.

109
00:09:28,497 --> 00:09:30,573
No, no.

110
00:09:30,706 --> 00:09:34,704
I don't think so, Ella. Cro-Magnon Man,
even though he's not bad-lookin',

111
00:09:34,794 --> 00:09:37,249
he's standin' upright and all,
he was extremely brutal.

112
00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:40,125
He just took whatever he wanted...

113
00:09:40,257 --> 00:09:42,417
and that included his women.

114
00:09:42,511 --> 00:09:45,261
- That's barbaric!
- lndeed.

115
00:10:02,238 --> 00:10:05,239
Stone! Stoney!

116
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:17,247
- Hey! Come on, check this out.
- That's my lobes.

117
00:10:17,337 --> 00:10:21,465
Feel the ground, man.

118
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:24,551
Whoa, buddy, it's chillin'.

119
00:10:24,677 --> 00:10:27,548
It's not like chillin', chillin'.

120
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,346
- Bro, it is chillin'!
- I know. It's cold!

121
00:10:31,476 --> 00:10:36,221
It's so, uh... Help me.

122
00:10:36,356 --> 00:10:37,980
Check it, buddy.

123
00:10:38,065 --> 00:10:40,272
Oh, buddy!

124
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,977
- Dude, I know what this is, bro.
- What is it?

125
00:10:44,113 --> 00:10:47,612
- It's a Mousterian bowl.
- No way!

126
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,488
Hey, come on, David.
Be careful with that.

127
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,494
What's a Mousterian bowl?

128
00:10:52,622 --> 00:10:55,577
A Mousterian bowl
from the Mousterian era.

129
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:59,753
"Prehistoric artifacts
for five hundred, Alex."

130
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:03,545
Don't you ever watch ""Jeopardy""?

131
00:11:03,674 --> 00:11:08,965
Buddy, this is kind of like
prehistoric Tupperware, bro.

132
00:11:09,055 --> 00:11:13,099
It's still preserved...
like Smuckers!

133
00:11:13,225 --> 00:11:16,096
Oooow!

134
00:11:16,228 --> 00:11:18,898
Earthquake!
Earthquake!

135
00:11:19,023 --> 00:11:21,775
Earthquake!

136
00:11:21,901 --> 00:11:24,190
Ahhhh!

137
00:11:24,278 --> 00:11:27,694
Oh!

138
00:11:27,823 --> 00:11:29,199
Oh, God!
Oh, God!

139
00:11:43,756 --> 00:11:46,164
Nice save, Davage.

140
00:11:56,978 --> 00:12:00,181
- Stone?
- Yeah.

141
00:12:00,273 --> 00:12:03,477
There's a guy buried in my pool.

142
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:09,401
Hello, Fred.
I'm glad I caught you.

143
00:12:09,533 --> 00:12:12,320
Are you available for a meeting
sometime this week?

144
00:12:12,452 --> 00:12:15,156
- Ms Morgan, open the door!
- Mom!

145
00:12:15,288 --> 00:12:19,866
Mom, there's a guy
buried in our pool!

146
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:22,746
- Mom! Mom!
- Open the door!

147
00:12:22,878 --> 00:12:24,752
I'm working!

148
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,961
Call 9-1-1!
Call 9-1-1!

149
00:12:36,393 --> 00:12:38,930
They never found Jim Morrison.

150
00:12:39,061 --> 00:12:42,181
Yeah, or Jimmy Hoffa.

151
00:12:42,316 --> 00:12:45,933
Or Jimmy Mahoney.

152
00:12:46,068 --> 00:12:48,477
He was a kid I knew
in Cub Scouts.

153
00:12:48,613 --> 00:12:50,487
Come on, let's go.

154
00:12:50,615 --> 00:12:52,856
They never found him.

155
00:12:58,582 --> 00:13:01,072
- David, I know what this is.
- What?

156
00:13:01,167 --> 00:13:04,749
- It's a caveman.
- Would you please!

157
00:13:04,837 --> 00:13:07,507
No, I'm serious.

158
00:13:09,842 --> 00:13:12,334
No way!

159
00:13:12,471 --> 00:13:15,803
Whoa. A caveman!

160
00:13:15,932 --> 00:13:21,222
This is unbelievable!
Do you know what this could mean for us?

161
00:13:21,355 --> 00:13:24,309
This could mean...
This could mean fame or money!

162
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,309
Or popularity!

163
00:13:26,401 --> 00:13:28,808
Far too much responsibility for me.

164
00:13:28,903 --> 00:13:31,311
Anyways, I'm already popular.

165
00:13:31,406 --> 00:13:34,821
Yeah, you travel
in large groups of one, Stoney.

166
00:13:34,951 --> 00:13:38,284
Besides, this is my one chance
to make somethin' out of myself.

167
00:13:38,372 --> 00:13:41,822
You gotta help me dig him out.
You were here. You're part of it.

168
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:47,041
I don't wanna be part of anything, Dave.
I'm happy just to be me.

169
00:13:47,171 --> 00:13:50,042
It could mean money.

170
00:13:50,174 --> 00:13:55,514
You tellin' me you couldn't use
a, a new scooter?

171
00:13:55,596 --> 00:13:58,384
Some new bell-bottoms?

172
00:13:58,517 --> 00:14:01,352
A little fun-dage?

173
00:14:01,478 --> 00:14:05,558
Wease some older nugs
with a mansion and a pool?

174
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:08,856
Soakin' up the rays,

175
00:14:08,985 --> 00:14:12,520
watchin' all the ""Jeop-ardy""
you can handle?

176
00:14:12,613 --> 00:14:16,065
- That was the clincher.
- Everybody's got a price. Come on, man.

177
00:14:28,254 --> 00:14:32,252
Steady it!
Give it more gas, more gas!

178
00:14:32,384 --> 00:14:34,839
Perfect! Hold!

179
00:14:36,513 --> 00:14:38,506
This thing weighs a ton.

180
00:14:58,868 --> 00:15:01,988
Ahh!

181
00:15:07,918 --> 00:15:11,502
Hey, there's his pits, bro.

182
00:15:14,216 --> 00:15:17,052
That's his head.

183
00:15:17,136 --> 00:15:19,426
That's his skull.

184
00:15:31,651 --> 00:15:34,687
Get off me!

185
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:38,487
- What are you doin'?
- I don't like mornings.

186
00:15:38,616 --> 00:15:41,404
Ow!
Come on, let's get up.

187
00:15:42,161 --> 00:15:44,782
He's still in here.

188
00:15:45,915 --> 00:15:48,620
No kidding, Dave.
He's an ice cube.

189
00:15:48,751 --> 00:15:52,618
- We gotta thaw him out.
- Okay.

190
00:15:54,882 --> 00:15:56,791
This has gotta be our secret, okay?

191
00:15:56,926 --> 00:15:59,465
You can't tell anybody... nobody!

192
00:15:59,595 --> 00:16:02,169
- Can I tell Steve Kooser?
- No one!

193
00:16:02,307 --> 00:16:05,806
- All right? Nobody! You understand?
- Yeah, zip...

194
00:16:05,935 --> 00:16:08,391
- Thank you.
- Dee-do-dah.

195
00:16:25,871 --> 00:16:28,328
- This is kind of nice.
- You were great.

196
00:16:28,417 --> 00:16:31,085
- Hi, Robyn.
- Hi, Dave.

197
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:34,211
- Guess what I found?
- A life?

198
00:16:34,339 --> 00:16:36,746
No. Come here.
Guess what I found?

199
00:16:36,882 --> 00:16:39,339
- I don't know. I have no idea.
- Guess? Guess?

200
00:16:39,428 --> 00:16:42,262
- I found a caveman.
- A caveman?

201
00:16:42,389 --> 00:16:46,172
- Shh. Yeah.
- Oh, Dave, you're drowning.

202
00:16:46,267 --> 00:16:48,840
It's cool, right?
I found a caveman.

203
00:16:48,936 --> 00:16:51,309
All by myself.
I dug him out of my backyard.

204
00:16:51,398 --> 00:16:53,888
- You wanna come check him out
after school?
- Well, uh...

205
00:16:54,025 --> 00:16:57,442
- I'm only invitin' a few people.
- I got that prom thing.

206
00:16:57,571 --> 00:17:00,572
Ten minutes. Please?

207
00:17:00,698 --> 00:17:04,696
Dave, I just don't think
I'm ready to handle a...

208
00:17:04,785 --> 00:17:06,695
a caveman.

209
00:17:06,787 --> 00:17:09,788
You're not?

210
00:17:09,915 --> 00:17:11,825
All right.

211
00:17:11,917 --> 00:17:14,871
I understand.

212
00:17:15,004 --> 00:17:17,330
Bye, David.

213
00:17:18,924 --> 00:17:22,969
I love it when she calls me David.

214
00:17:23,095 --> 00:17:26,548
- Hello, David.
- Agh.

215
00:17:26,641 --> 00:17:28,551
Goin' somewhere?

216
00:17:28,643 --> 00:17:31,216
- Yeah, I got a date with your mom.
- That's not nice.

217
00:17:31,313 --> 00:17:34,433
It's a joke.
I'm sorry, just kidding.

218
00:17:58,631 --> 00:18:02,082
- You've been a headache
ever since the third grade.
- God!

219
00:18:02,176 --> 00:18:05,877
I know about your stupid
prom-king bullshit. Forget it.

220
00:18:05,972 --> 00:18:09,839
Robyn wouldn't piss on your gums
if your teeth were on fire.

221
00:18:09,976 --> 00:18:12,680
Yes, she would.

222
00:18:12,812 --> 00:18:15,932
Shush! Hush, please!

223
00:18:16,023 --> 00:18:18,432
Showin' your ignorance again, Morgan.

224
00:18:18,527 --> 00:18:23,651
Some of us pump
and some of us slump.

225
00:18:23,781 --> 00:18:27,566
You should try some pump, Morgan.
Might clear up your acne.

226
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:31,076
- You're so...
- Am I?

227
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,367
N-no, stop.

228
00:18:35,502 --> 00:18:37,376
Stop it!

229
00:18:37,504 --> 00:18:39,626
Why do you make me do this?

230
00:18:39,755 --> 00:18:43,124
What are you writing?
Hey, what did you write?

231
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:46,632
Matt, not the fire alarm!

232
00:18:46,721 --> 00:18:48,298
Matt! Matt!

233
00:18:48,432 --> 00:18:53,426
God, help! Oh, God!

234
00:18:54,479 --> 00:18:57,183
Hey, come here.
Oh, ta-ha-ha.

235
00:21:52,114 --> 00:21:53,988
Hmm.

236
00:22:36,909 --> 00:22:39,281
I'll be back.

He melted.

245
00:23:36,969 --> 00:23:40,588
Dave, it just wasn't
meant to happen.

246
00:23:40,681 --> 00:23:43,931
Come on, I'll go buy you some Ho-Hos.

247
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:47,846
Come on. It's all right.

248
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,854
He melted.

249
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,609
Boris!

250
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:13,623
What the...

251
00:24:37,655 --> 00:24:40,110
I can't believe it.
He's alive!

252
00:24:40,199 --> 00:24:42,655
He was practically an ice cube...
practically.

253
00:24:42,785 --> 00:24:45,324
- I say we just walk.
- No, no way!

254
00:24:45,414 --> 00:24:49,825
- Oh, please.
- He is ours. We found him.

255
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:53,701
- What?
- Be hospitable?

256
00:25:00,304 --> 00:25:03,388
- Ooh!
- Ahh! Ahh!

257
00:25:03,515 --> 00:25:08,176
How ya doin'?
Hi, my name is Dave.

258
00:25:10,855 --> 00:25:13,477
Come here, come here.
lntroduce yourself.

259
00:25:13,567 --> 00:25:17,860
This is Stoney.
Stoney, he's my friend.

260
00:25:17,987 --> 00:25:19,861
Uh, this is my room.

261
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,778
It's okay.
It's okay.

262
00:25:25,412 --> 00:25:29,029
Uh, we're from Encino.

263
00:25:29,123 --> 00:25:31,496
It's a pleasure
to make your acquaintance.

264
00:25:31,585 --> 00:25:33,494
- We hope you don't gnaw on our beaks.
- Shh.

265
00:25:33,587 --> 00:25:36,919
I know what I'm doing, Stone.

266
00:25:39,842 --> 00:25:44,171
We go to high school.
High school?

267
00:25:44,263 --> 00:25:46,172
He doesn't know
what high school is.

268
00:25:46,265 --> 00:25:48,389
He doesn't know
what anything is.

269
00:25:48,518 --> 00:25:50,724
Just be calm and easy.

270
00:25:50,853 --> 00:25:56,524
- Calm... and easy.
- Hey, hi.

271
00:26:06,578 --> 00:26:09,697
- Get the phone.
- Okay. Okay.

272
00:26:25,137 --> 00:26:27,296
It's okay.
It's okay.

273
00:26:27,432 --> 00:26:29,425
See, I think he's calming down.

274
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:32,762
Calming... down.

275
00:26:42,364 --> 00:26:44,272
Ugh?

276
00:26:45,658 --> 00:26:50,154
Fire. Flameage.

277
00:26:50,288 --> 00:26:52,957
- Buddy's into it.
- That was kill, Stone.

278
00:26:53,082 --> 00:26:56,747
- Look at his eyes.
- He likes the blue part.

279
00:26:56,836 --> 00:27:00,620
- He's glossy-eyed.
- Look, freak him out. Ow!

280
00:27:00,715 --> 00:27:02,125
Ow! Ooh!

281
00:27:03,801 --> 00:27:06,802
- Ugh!
- Okay. Ah, ah!

282
00:27:10,683 --> 00:27:12,806
- Give it to him.
- No!

283
00:27:12,893 --> 00:27:14,803
Ugh. Ugh.

284
00:27:14,895 --> 00:27:19,142
- Here, here. Look, here.
- You gotta teach him.

285
00:27:19,275 --> 00:27:21,565
Whoa! Oh.

286
00:27:32,872 --> 00:27:34,070
Hey!

287
00:27:34,206 --> 00:27:37,077
- No.
- No.

288
00:27:37,209 --> 00:27:39,083
What? Did you just...

289
00:27:39,211 --> 00:27:42,332
- I think he just said ""no.""
- No!

290
00:27:42,424 --> 00:27:45,508
- No?
- No! No!

291
00:27:45,635 --> 00:27:47,923
No. No.

292
00:27:48,054 --> 00:27:52,763
Cool, buddy.
He is so greasy!

293
00:27:52,892 --> 00:27:56,806
Greasy?
He's a prehistoric pyromaniac.

294
00:27:56,896 --> 00:28:00,099
- We gotta teach him stuff.
- We'll teach him how to wease.

295
00:28:00,232 --> 00:28:03,353
No. No.

296
00:28:03,445 --> 00:28:06,813
- No!
- No! No!

297
00:28:06,906 --> 00:28:10,490
Oh, God.
We gotta teach him how to be normal.

298
00:28:10,577 --> 00:28:13,412
No, uh-uh.
We're goin' psycho with him, bro.

299
00:28:13,538 --> 00:28:15,696
That's boring, dude. Normal!

300
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:18,245
Stoney, come on, man.
Hang with me.

301
00:28:18,377 --> 00:28:20,249
We gotta play this thing out.

302
00:28:20,379 --> 00:28:24,245
If we tell anyone, if anyone sees him,
they'll take him away from us.

303
00:28:24,383 --> 00:28:26,291
They'll cut him up
into little pieces.

304
00:28:26,426 --> 00:28:29,380
They'll take all the credit,
and we'll still be geeks.

305
00:28:29,471 --> 00:28:33,847
I'm not a geek.
I'm a unique weasel, David.

306
00:28:33,933 --> 00:28:36,850
I'm just underrated 'cause
I live here in Encino.

307
00:28:36,936 --> 00:28:40,601
Bud?
Buddy?

308
00:28:40,731 --> 00:28:42,973
- O-o-o-ow!
- Okay?

309
00:28:43,109 --> 00:28:45,565
He needs a bath... big time.

- Standing O.
- Outstanding.

322
00:30:07,527 --> 00:30:10,564
- If I had a Bic, bro, right here.
- Don't freak him out.

323
00:30:10,696 --> 00:30:12,736
- Let's show him himself.
- Okay.

324
00:30:12,865 --> 00:30:15,273
You wanna see your mug, bud?
Check it.

325
00:30:15,369 --> 00:30:17,277
Ugh!

326
00:30:17,371 --> 00:30:19,695
What, dude?
You should be with your mug, bro.

327
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:23,164
You look buff.
Right?

328
00:30:23,292 --> 00:30:28,832
Hey, can you
say ""ba... uff""?

329
00:30:28,965 --> 00:30:34,207
Ba... uff?

330
00:30:34,346 --> 00:30:38,010
I like that.
You know, you pause too.

331
00:30:40,477 --> 00:30:42,634
We gotta give him a cool name.

332
00:30:42,728 --> 00:30:44,935
Axl. Yeah, buddy.

333
00:30:45,064 --> 00:30:47,685
- Not Axl. This is serious.
- Okay.

334
00:30:47,775 --> 00:30:50,349
We've got the missing link
standing in my bedroom.

335
00:30:53,114 --> 00:30:57,028
Link! Link!
We'll call him Link!

336
00:30:57,118 --> 00:31:00,783
Okay, cool. Maybe we could call him
Stoney Number Two...

337
00:31:00,913 --> 00:31:02,953
because he's got my same 'do...

338
00:31:03,082 --> 00:31:05,787
and he's from the Stone Age.

339
00:31:05,918 --> 00:31:09,252
- I like Link better.
- Okay, we'll call him Link.

340
00:31:09,381 --> 00:31:11,374
- But can I call him Linkage?
- Cool!

341
00:31:11,508 --> 00:31:14,958
- Cool!
- Let's see how smart he is.

342
00:31:17,514 --> 00:31:19,388
No, no.
Come here.

343
00:31:19,516 --> 00:31:23,180
- Okay. Okay. You okay?
- Uh.

344
00:31:23,269 --> 00:31:25,890
Uh, uh, look.

345
00:31:27,857 --> 00:31:31,937
- See?
- Ugh. Ahh?

346
00:31:32,069 --> 00:31:34,691
- Whoa! Aah!
- Whoa! Aah!

347
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:36,939
Ahh, oow, ooo.

348
00:31:37,074 --> 00:31:39,401
Ooow!

349
00:31:39,536 --> 00:31:41,741
Okay, okay.

350
00:31:41,871 --> 00:31:44,622
Um, Link.

351
00:31:44,749 --> 00:31:48,746
- Link.
- No!

352
00:31:48,878 --> 00:31:51,879
You're Link.
I'm Dave. Dave!

353
00:31:51,964 --> 00:31:53,873
Dave. Dave.

354
00:31:53,966 --> 00:31:57,502
No, Dave, Dave.
Dave, Dave, Dave.

355
00:31:57,637 --> 00:31:59,925
- Dave.
- Yes!

356
00:32:00,056 --> 00:32:02,843
Okay, and that's...

357
00:32:02,975 --> 00:32:05,762
- That's Stoney.
- Mm-hmm.

358
00:32:05,895 --> 00:32:08,600
Sto... ney.

359
00:32:08,689 --> 00:32:12,023
- No, no. Stoney.
- Stoney.

360
00:32:12,151 --> 00:32:14,938
- Yes!
- Aah!

361
00:32:15,029 --> 00:32:19,940
Okay, okay.
And now you are?

362
00:32:20,076 --> 00:32:22,115
Dave! Aah!

363
00:32:22,203 --> 00:32:25,951
No, no, I'm Dave.
You are?

364
00:32:31,837 --> 00:32:33,877
Buff.

365
00:32:34,006 --> 00:32:37,624
No.

366
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:41,344
It's all right. You've had a hard day.

367
00:32:41,431 --> 00:32:43,802
- Your parents!
- My parents!

368
00:32:45,935 --> 00:32:49,352
Okay, uh, uh, take him out back
and ring the doorbell three times.

369
00:32:49,439 --> 00:32:51,846
- But, Dave...
- No ""buts,"" just do it!

370
00:32:51,941 --> 00:32:56,769
Follow the weasel, Linkage, come on.
Quick, quick, quick.

371
00:33:01,576 --> 00:33:04,494
My kitchen!

372
00:33:06,622 --> 00:33:08,947
Busted!

373
00:33:09,083 --> 00:33:12,535
What are you doing?

374
00:33:12,628 --> 00:33:15,878
- What are you doing?
- I'm cooking dinner.

375
00:33:16,007 --> 00:33:17,667
- You're what?
- Busted!

376
00:33:17,758 --> 00:33:20,878
I'm cooking dinner.
I thought it might be a nice surprise.

377
00:33:21,012 --> 00:33:22,720
They're surprised, all right.

378
00:33:25,309 --> 00:33:27,348
What is going on here?

379
00:33:27,436 --> 00:33:29,559
Where's the flour?
I can't find the flour.

380
00:33:29,687 --> 00:33:33,981
Hello, Stanley. Who is this strange boy
and why is he ringing my doorbell?

381
00:33:34,108 --> 00:33:39,019
- It got stuck, sir.
- Come in. Meet your new family.

382
00:33:39,113 --> 00:33:41,782
Whose family?

383
00:33:41,907 --> 00:33:44,743
Boris, get down! Boris!

384
00:33:44,827 --> 00:33:48,825
- Boris, get out!
- Get down!

385
00:33:48,956 --> 00:33:52,409
Get out, get out!

386
00:33:54,128 --> 00:33:56,002
Hey, Dad.

387
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:58,087
- David, who is that?
- Huh?

388
00:33:58,215 --> 00:33:59,923
That? Who's that?

389
00:34:00,051 --> 00:34:04,262
- That was Linkavitch Chomofsky.
- What?

390
00:34:04,348 --> 00:34:08,676
Link... Linkav... Doesn't anybody
in this house listen to anything I say?

391
00:34:08,809 --> 00:34:10,849
What is he talking about?

392
00:34:10,978 --> 00:34:12,852
Dad, Linkavitch Chomofsky.

393
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:16,100
Our exchange student?
He's here.

394
00:34:16,233 --> 00:34:18,226
He's gonna help us dig the pool.

395
00:34:19,529 --> 00:34:21,272
Yeah!

396
00:34:21,365 --> 00:34:24,068
Why does none of this
sound familiar to me?

397
00:34:24,158 --> 00:34:26,401
I told you about this months ago,
remember?

398
00:34:26,495 --> 00:34:31,203
About school giving us extra credit for
college for housing exchange students,

399
00:34:31,333 --> 00:34:34,286
and learning about their culture
and you said it was okay.

400
00:34:34,419 --> 00:34:36,992
Now you're gonna take it back?

401
00:34:37,129 --> 00:34:39,003
No, no, no,
I'm not gonna take it back.

402
00:34:39,131 --> 00:34:41,421
This is important to me.
This is my life.

403
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:44,960
It's embarrassing.
He travelled here all the way from...

404
00:34:45,096 --> 00:34:48,963
- I don't know, Estonia?
- Yeah, Estonia!

405
00:34:49,058 --> 00:34:51,431
Mom, come on.
You're not buying this?

406
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,429
- Well, l...
- Dad?

407
00:34:53,522 --> 00:34:57,601
Actually, I, I, I think now...

408
00:34:57,692 --> 00:35:01,191
that I, I, I do recall something.

409
00:35:01,321 --> 00:35:04,238
- See?
- See, it's about focusing.

410
00:35:04,366 --> 00:35:08,826
- You're bogus.
- How could I forget something like this?

411
00:35:08,911 --> 00:35:12,280
He's an exchange student.
He's going to be staying in our house.

412
00:35:12,374 --> 00:35:14,282
You forgot me in the third grade.

413
00:35:14,376 --> 00:35:16,996
I spent the entire night after
the play in the parking lot.

414
00:35:17,086 --> 00:35:18,995
In the sixth grade, the soccer?

415
00:35:19,088 --> 00:35:22,837
Okay, where's he gonna stay?

416
00:35:22,925 --> 00:35:25,630
And why is he attacking the dog?

417
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:29,967
He's gonna stay in my room. He's not
attacking the dog. He's bonding.

418
00:35:30,057 --> 00:35:32,014
- As if!
- Shut up!

419
00:35:32,101 --> 00:35:34,391
- You shut up.
- No, everybody shut up.

420
00:35:34,521 --> 00:35:37,854
- Larry, it's okay.
- I'm tired. I'm a little hungry.

421
00:35:37,982 --> 00:35:41,185
It's time we decide
what we're gonna make for dinner.

422
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:44,154
- I assume you'll be joining us?
- You assume correctly, Mr M.

423
00:35:44,238 --> 00:35:48,533
We practically feed
the entire neighbourhood.
Why not part of Estonia as well, huh?

424
00:35:48,618 --> 00:35:50,776
I always eat here
and I like your food.

425
00:35:50,911 --> 00:35:53,948
Great.

426
00:35:54,081 --> 00:35:56,703
Stop it! No.

427
00:35:56,834 --> 00:36:01,128
No, no, no.

428
00:36:01,255 --> 00:36:05,834
I can't believe
you told my parents he's from Estonia.

429
00:36:05,926 --> 00:36:09,427
Cow pyjamas?
Those are kind of flaming.

430
00:36:09,556 --> 00:36:12,805
Ooh!

431
00:36:12,934 --> 00:36:17,014
- Some Betty, huh?
- Betty.

432
00:36:19,941 --> 00:36:22,515
Gonzangas.

433
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:26,773
- Gonzangas?
- Buddy, cones.

434
00:36:28,783 --> 00:36:31,902
I know you've had a big day, pal,
but tomorrow...

435
00:36:32,036 --> 00:36:34,823
I'm gonna take you
someplace really special.

436
00:36:34,956 --> 00:36:38,575
- Taco Bell.
- Better. Get the camera.

437
00:36:38,668 --> 00:36:43,414
Congratulations, Link.
You're gonna be a senior.

438
00:36:43,507 --> 00:36:45,913
Smile.

Oh, God, he doesn't like that.

444
00:37:10,409 --> 00:37:12,614
That's glass.
That hurts your beak.

445
00:37:12,702 --> 00:37:14,576
Stand up straight.

446
00:37:15,497 --> 00:37:17,406
Poor Stone-Ager.

447
00:37:17,499 --> 00:37:19,621
He spent a million years
chillin' in a block of ice.

448
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:22,787
Now he's gotta go
to high school! Agh!

449
00:37:22,878 --> 00:37:24,788
Who's that guy with
the dork squad?

450
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,131
- Oh, my God, he is totally rude.
- Totally.

451
00:37:29,844 --> 00:37:32,418
We have got a major find here.

452
00:37:32,514 --> 00:37:34,802
This guy's our ticket
to fame and popularity.

453
00:37:34,932 --> 00:37:38,633
All we gotta do is get him enrolled in
school and he'll help us become popular.

454
00:37:38,769 --> 00:37:42,719
- That's harsh.
- We'll make him famous.

455
00:37:42,857 --> 00:37:45,893
We'll teach him some stupid pet tricks
and get him on Letterman.

456
00:37:46,027 --> 00:37:48,400
You're weasin' off his gig.

457
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:50,854
Oh, please!
He's a caveman, for God sakes.

458
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:54,074
Look at him.
He's practically a monkey.

459
00:37:55,953 --> 00:37:59,156
We found him.
We can do whatever we want with him.

460
00:37:59,248 --> 00:38:01,656
We, we, we?
No, no, no. You, you, you.

461
00:38:01,792 --> 00:38:04,165
I just wanna be his friend.

462
00:38:04,295 --> 00:38:06,169
Fine.

463
00:38:06,297 --> 00:38:09,132
Hello, Mrs Mackey.

464
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:13,428
And what do we have here?

465
00:38:16,015 --> 00:38:18,388
Now I'm covered
up to fourth period.

466
00:38:18,518 --> 00:38:21,969
- I don't know what to do
with him after that.
- I can take him to Spanish.

467
00:38:22,063 --> 00:38:24,186
- Will you be careful?
- I'll be cool, man. I promise.

468
00:38:24,273 --> 00:38:26,681
Okay.

469
00:38:26,776 --> 00:38:28,685
What's he doin'?

470
00:38:28,778 --> 00:38:31,530
I don't know.

471
00:38:31,614 --> 00:38:33,939
Link, be careful!

472
00:38:41,749 --> 00:38:43,658
Uh, hey, hey...

473
00:38:43,751 --> 00:38:46,835
Hey, Link, how's your melon, bud?

474
00:38:54,845 --> 00:38:57,420
Whoa!

475
00:38:57,557 --> 00:39:00,047
Excuse me.
Hey, hey, hey!

476
00:39:00,184 --> 00:39:03,055
Whoa.

477
00:39:03,187 --> 00:39:05,560
Link?

478
00:39:06,857 --> 00:39:09,645
Is this dude totally fundamental
or what?

479
00:39:09,777 --> 00:39:12,149
- Did you miss me?
- Always.

480
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,817
- Who is this?
- This is my friend, Link.

481
00:39:14,949 --> 00:39:18,069
- Link.
- He's staying with us.
He's from Estonia.

482
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,530
You're kidding?
This guy is staying with you?

483
00:39:21,622 --> 00:39:23,698
Uh-huh.

484
00:39:25,042 --> 00:39:27,664
He's thinkin'
of becoming a hairdresser.

485
00:39:27,795 --> 00:39:30,831
Designing crusty mops
for the rich and famous.

486
00:39:30,965 --> 00:39:32,245
Oh.

487
00:39:32,342 --> 00:39:35,046
Ugh. Gonzangas.

488
00:39:35,136 --> 00:39:37,923
- No! Bye, Robyn.
- Hey, hey, hey.

489
00:39:38,055 --> 00:39:40,594
I think he was saying
he likes your cones.

490
00:39:40,683 --> 00:39:44,099
I'm thrilled.
Get out of my face!

491
00:39:44,228 --> 00:39:46,102
Robyn, that import is mine.

492
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:48,982
- This is just in time for prom.
- Yeah?

493
00:39:49,108 --> 00:39:51,943
- Is he fine or what?
- I'm not sure.

494
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:08,204
- He's a looker!
- Link. Link!

495
00:40:08,337 --> 00:40:10,957
Link, please, come sit down.

496
00:40:11,047 --> 00:40:14,297
Who is this dipshit, anyway?

497
00:40:14,384 --> 00:40:16,292
His name's Link.

498
00:40:16,428 --> 00:40:19,262
He's from Estonia
and I think he's jive.

499
00:40:19,348 --> 00:40:22,597
Jive, yeah. You do?

500
00:40:22,683 --> 00:40:25,969
Hell, yeah,
and I'm not the only one.

501
00:40:26,103 --> 00:40:28,096
Hey, Link!

502
00:40:33,736 --> 00:40:36,144
I'll see you next period.

503
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,652
- Watch him.
- All right, David.

504
00:40:38,783 --> 00:40:42,780
We got Spanish now. Spanish
is like guacamole, chips and salsa.

505
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:46,915
La dia es mi en hermanos.

506
00:40:47,041 --> 00:40:49,580
The day is beautiful.

507
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:53,210
The sun isn't shining
all through the night.

508
00:41:04,725 --> 00:41:08,344
Link, come on.
Sorry, you guys.

509
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,351
Whoa!

510
00:41:14,569 --> 00:41:17,523
Vale, repitan en espanol.

511
00:41:17,655 --> 00:41:20,193
The cheese is old and moldy.

512
00:41:20,283 --> 00:41:24,447
El queso esta viejo y podrido.

513
00:41:24,579 --> 00:41:26,453
Where is the bathroom?

514
00:41:26,581 --> 00:41:30,199
Ї Donde esta el sanitario?

515
00:41:30,293 --> 00:41:33,662
Ї Donde esta el sanitario?

516
00:41:33,754 --> 00:41:37,170
- Good, once again.
- You're cute.

517
00:41:37,258 --> 00:41:39,963
You're cute.

518
00:41:40,094 --> 00:41:42,965
Meet me at Blades tonight.

519
00:41:43,097 --> 00:41:45,670
Blades tonight.

520
00:41:48,437 --> 00:41:52,932
- Yes, what?
- You can drop him off
in front of Blades tonight, right?

521
00:41:53,065 --> 00:41:55,983
Can David and I go too, please?

522
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:58,483
You smell.

523
00:41:58,613 --> 00:42:02,028
Hey, "seniorita."
That hurt my lobes.

524
00:42:02,116 --> 00:42:04,903
I didn't do it.
They started the whole thing.

525
00:42:11,167 --> 00:42:13,410
Kashmir? Rajneesh, is it?

526
00:42:13,503 --> 00:42:16,040
- How many minutes for the burrito?
- Two minutes.

527
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:19,629
- One minute.
- Two minutes!

528
00:42:19,759 --> 00:42:23,092
Ah, make up your melons!

529
00:42:23,179 --> 00:42:26,180
- Is it one or two?
- One and a half minutes.

530
00:42:26,308 --> 00:42:27,931
Okay.

531
00:42:28,059 --> 00:42:31,511
Okay, my friend.
Try and experience...

532
00:42:31,646 --> 00:42:34,646
- what I'm about to chirp
in your lobes, cool?
- Hey.

533
00:42:34,774 --> 00:42:37,146
We're going to discuss grindage.

534
00:42:37,276 --> 00:42:42,022
How to fill the furnace, pack the cheeks
and stuff the gills. Okay?

535
00:42:42,156 --> 00:42:44,777
You're used to eating twigs, right?

536
00:42:44,909 --> 00:42:47,945
But here in the U.S. of A-age
we got something called...

537
00:42:48,037 --> 00:42:51,785
the four basic food groups,
and this is not one of 'em.

538
00:42:51,874 --> 00:42:53,618
Oh.

539
00:42:53,751 --> 00:42:56,123
Look at what we have here.

540
00:42:56,212 --> 00:42:58,288
- Dairy group.
- Dairy group.

541
00:42:58,382 --> 00:43:02,295
Milk Duds. Hide these under your pillow
so your mom doesn't find them.

542
00:43:02,427 --> 00:43:04,503
If she does, you're tweaked, buddy.

543
00:43:04,637 --> 00:43:06,346
Keep on cruisin'.

544
00:43:06,473 --> 00:43:08,963
Fruit group.
Sweet Tarts.

545
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:12,848
These are killer.
So citrusy, dude, you'll freak.

546
00:43:12,979 --> 00:43:15,185
Keep on cruisin'. Uh-huh.

547
00:43:15,315 --> 00:43:18,400
Right, this is the vegetable group.

548
00:43:18,527 --> 00:43:22,025
Corn Nuts!
Put 'em on a pedestal, bro.

549
00:43:22,154 --> 00:43:24,824
Look at that! Those are kill, huh?

550
00:43:24,949 --> 00:43:28,485
Meat group!
Come on, the meat group.

551
00:43:28,619 --> 00:43:32,119
These are my favourite!

552
00:43:33,333 --> 00:43:38,623
Hey, you gotta be equal,
equal, fifty/fifty.

553
00:43:38,713 --> 00:43:42,379
- Here. Mmm.
- Mmm.

554
00:43:44,218 --> 00:43:46,626
Ooh! Figures.

555
00:43:46,721 --> 00:43:51,133
- Hot on the outside, icicle in the middle.
-  - Two minutes.

556
00:43:51,225 --> 00:43:53,681
You like that, right,
'cause you're a caveman.

557
00:43:53,811 --> 00:43:55,354
Cool, buddy.

558
00:43:55,439 --> 00:43:58,641
The beverage!
lcee, bro.

559
00:43:58,733 --> 00:44:01,355
This is what put
this place on the map.

560
00:44:01,486 --> 00:44:04,440
What are you doing,
Mr Stoney? No, no!

561
00:44:04,573 --> 00:44:08,107
- You can't do this here.
- You must leave now, please.

562
00:44:08,242 --> 00:44:12,026
- Look, Kashmir, Rajneesh, chill.
- No buds chill!

563
00:44:12,163 --> 00:44:16,872
Link and I are cruisin' the mountain
and we figured we'd wease ju-uice.

564
00:44:17,001 --> 00:44:20,701
- No weasin' the ju-uice.
- Wease the juice!

565
00:44:20,796 --> 00:44:23,371
No!
No weasin' the juice.

566
00:44:23,508 --> 00:44:25,132
No weasin' the juice.

567
00:44:25,259 --> 00:44:30,633
- Hey, just chill, buds.
- No buds chill.

568
00:44:30,765 --> 00:44:34,264
It's okay.
Just chill.

569
00:44:38,272 --> 00:44:41,724
- I'll be back.
- No buds chill!

570
00:44:50,952 --> 00:44:53,360
Oh, God, no!
Wait! Stop!

571
00:45:38,124 --> 00:45:40,697
Here we go!

572
00:46:03,774 --> 00:46:05,648
Comin' home!

573
00:46:05,776 --> 00:46:09,062
Was that the hottest or what, bro?

- Stop!

576
00:46:24,504 --> 00:46:27,291
Where did you go?
You just took off.

577
00:46:27,382 --> 00:46:29,290
Do you know how worried I've been?

578
00:46:29,384 --> 00:46:32,799
- You sound like my mom.
- You can't do that to me.

579
00:46:32,887 --> 00:46:35,176
What's on his nose?

580
00:46:35,307 --> 00:46:37,430
Just chill, Dave,
'cause you know why?

581
00:46:37,559 --> 00:46:39,681
Link and I
had a stoney time at the Mountain.

582
00:46:39,810 --> 00:46:42,764
You took him to Mega Mountain?
Are you crazy?

583
00:46:42,897 --> 00:46:44,936
Yeah, 'cause they're
riding the Vapour in reverse.

584
00:46:45,066 --> 00:46:47,308
- They are? Oh, cool.
- Uh-huh.

585
00:46:47,402 --> 00:46:50,153
Check out the fresh nugs.
Weasin' the juice.

00:46:57,579 --> 00:47:00,366
Oh, my God!
You got him talkin' like you now.

00:47:00,499 --> 00:47:01,612
- O-o-o-ow.

591
00:47:03,918 --> 00:47:07,203
Gee, Link, that is so beautiful.
Is it old?

592
00:47:10,509 --> 00:47:13,674
You know, Mr M.,
the way I look at it, some day...

593
00:47:13,761 --> 00:47:16,335
your daughter and I
could be married...

594
00:47:16,431 --> 00:47:20,511
- and we could be related.
- I count the days.

595
00:47:27,942 --> 00:47:32,236
So, Stanley, how's your mother?

596
00:47:32,364 --> 00:47:35,318
She's really bummed.
Can you pass the peas?

597
00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:38,404
- Sure.
- Thanks.

598
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:43,572
Mr Morgan, if you're edged 'cause I'm
weasin' on your grindage, just chill.

599
00:47:43,708 --> 00:47:46,744
'Cause if I had the whole
Brady Bunch thing happenin' at my pad,

600
00:47:46,877 --> 00:47:48,751
I'd go grind over there.

601
00:47:48,879 --> 00:47:51,336
So don't tax my gig
so hard-core, cruster.

602
00:47:51,466 --> 00:47:54,669
- Stanley, speak English.
- Dad!

603
00:47:54,802 --> 00:47:58,421
Link, how was your day?
How are you adjusting?

604
00:47:58,515 --> 00:48:01,764
He's doin' just great.
We got him enrolled in all his classes.

605
00:48:01,892 --> 00:48:04,134
- Didn't we, pal? Yeah.
- Ugh.

606
00:48:04,270 --> 00:48:07,271
A success.

607
00:48:07,357 --> 00:48:09,894
What's up?

608
00:48:12,111 --> 00:48:16,489
How was your day, Mom?
Where you goin'?

609
00:48:16,616 --> 00:48:19,949
- What's he doin'?
- I think he's tracking a fly.

610
00:48:20,036 --> 00:48:24,116

616
00:48:52,693 --> 00:48:56,359
He's into munchin' too, you know.

617
00:49:06,832 --> 00:49:10,284
Blades.
Finally part of the elite.

618
00:49:10,379 --> 00:49:13,996
- How cool are we?
- We're cool.

I got the raddest deodorant on, buddy.
Take a whiff, bro.

621
00:49:22,098 --> 00:49:26,346
♪ Oh, no, you're invited
but your friend can't come ♪

622
00:49:28,563 --> 00:49:30,473
Link, hey!

623
00:49:33,443 --> 00:49:37,571
- I am so glad to see you.
- Ugh.

624
00:49:39,156 --> 00:49:42,822
Oh, hon, lose the geek squad.
They're bad for your deal.

625
00:49:42,910 --> 00:49:44,867
Blades!

626
00:49:44,996 --> 00:49:47,202
Hummer patrol, Barneys incoming.

627
00:49:47,290 --> 00:49:49,330
Robyn.

628
00:49:49,418 --> 00:49:51,160
- Get him.
- Got him.

629
00:49:51,252 --> 00:49:53,376
Hey, Rob...

630
00:49:53,463 --> 00:49:55,122
Robyn!

631
00:49:55,256 --> 00:49:56,715
- Good.
- Good.

632
00:49:56,841 --> 00:49:58,999
That was not cool at all,
you guys.

633
00:49:59,093 --> 00:50:01,216
You could hurt his pancreas
or something.

634
00:50:09,186 --> 00:50:13,267
I like the ketchup and mustard.
Very avant-garde.

635
00:50:15,109 --> 00:50:18,810
- Whoa! Is that me?
- Betty.

636
00:50:18,946 --> 00:50:20,903
Betty. Betty?

637
00:50:21,032 --> 00:50:24,816
- Betty, Betty nugs.
- Betty nugs.

638
00:50:24,952 --> 00:50:27,028
Robyn, don't forget,

639
00:50:27,121 --> 00:50:30,122
we've been naked together.

640
00:50:33,337 --> 00:50:35,909
- Nice body.
- Remember when we were together?

641
00:50:36,047 --> 00:50:38,420
- Did you show this to anyone?
- No.

642
00:50:38,508 --> 00:50:40,915
- That's your copy. Show anyone you want.
- Thanks, Dave.

643
00:50:41,052 --> 00:50:46,757
Oh, I get it. This is, like,
your old girlfriend in Estonia?

644
00:50:46,891 --> 00:50:49,761
- Do you miss her?
- Ugh.

645
00:50:49,852 --> 00:50:52,224
Because I can tell you
from experience,

646
00:50:52,314 --> 00:50:56,145
long-distance relationships
never work out.

647
00:51:07,745 --> 00:51:12,122
- Estonia's a long ways away, Link.
- Yeah.

648
00:51:12,208 --> 00:51:14,117
And I'm right here...

649
00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:16,915
- so let's work on changing your mind.
- Rad Mobile.

650
00:51:17,004 --> 00:51:19,626
Rad Mobile.
Rad Mobile.

651
00:51:19,715 --> 00:51:22,965
Whoa!

652
00:51:23,719 --> 00:51:25,628
Or not.

653
00:51:25,721 --> 00:51:28,971
You just think I'm bad for your act,
that's all.

654
00:51:29,058 --> 00:51:31,679
Right, and you think
I'm good for yours.

655
00:51:31,811 --> 00:51:34,646
- What?
- Matt!

656
00:51:34,772 --> 00:51:38,391
What are you doin'?
You're not allowed in here.

657
00:51:40,987 --> 00:51:45,695
Whoa-oa-oa!

658
00:51:45,825 --> 00:51:48,577
Woo!
Woo-woo-woo-woo!

659
00:51:48,703 --> 00:51:50,695
Are you deaf, dork?

660
00:51:50,830 --> 00:51:52,953
- Didn't I forbid you to speak to her?
- I'm sorry.

661
00:51:56,752 --> 00:51:58,626
That's all, Link.
It's over.

662
00:51:58,713 --> 00:52:00,919
End of story.

663
00:52:07,597 --> 00:52:10,385
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Huh?

664
00:52:10,517 --> 00:52:13,054
Wease some juice!

665
00:52:13,185 --> 00:52:16,934
Hey, you want a piece of me?

666
00:52:21,486 --> 00:52:25,269
Oh, God!

667
00:52:26,616 --> 00:52:28,526
I don't know you.

668
00:52:28,618 --> 00:52:30,859
I don't like you.

669
00:52:30,995 --> 00:52:35,040
As of now, I'm all over you.

670
00:52:49,013 --> 00:52:52,465
- Did you see that?
- The new kid, he took it.

671
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:54,475
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

672
00:52:54,602 --> 00:52:58,896
Don't just stand there.
Do something. Stand up for yourself.

673
00:52:58,981 --> 00:53:00,890
Hit him back!

674
00:53:00,983 --> 00:53:03,023
Link, hit him back!
Where you goin'?

675
00:53:03,110 --> 00:53:05,981
What do you think
of your Bulgarian dork bud now?

676
00:53:06,113 --> 00:53:07,987
Hmm?

677
00:53:08,115 --> 00:53:12,328
That was harsh, Matt.

678
00:53:13,497 --> 00:53:15,738
Let's get out of here.

679
00:53:15,831 --> 00:53:18,916
The stench of losers
is doing damage to my sinuses.

680
00:53:19,001 --> 00:53:22,785
Just stop it, Matt.
Don't even come near me.

681
00:53:22,922 --> 00:53:24,796
Hey, watch it.

682
00:53:24,924 --> 00:53:28,922
Why don't you take this,
'cause I don't think I need it any more.

683
00:53:29,053 --> 00:53:30,844
Hey!

684
00:53:30,972 --> 00:53:34,886
- I can't believe he got nailed.
- He's a pacifist.

685
00:53:34,976 --> 00:53:38,392
A pacifist caveman?
You're mental.

686
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,437
Cavemens aren't like us, Dave.

687
00:53:40,524 --> 00:53:44,356
They fought for food and survival.
They did not fight for popularity.

688
00:53:44,486 --> 00:53:47,487
- What would he be fighting for, huh?
- For face.

689
00:53:47,613 --> 00:53:50,947
- For us! To be cool!
- Cool, huh?

690
00:53:51,033 --> 00:53:53,360
He does not know what cool is.

691
00:53:53,495 --> 00:53:56,614
He doesn't know where he is.
He knows nothin'.

692
00:53:57,790 --> 00:54:00,460
He's gotta learn
how to defend himself.

693
00:54:00,585 --> 00:54:04,914
- Against what?
- Against buttholes like Matt.

694
00:54:15,350 --> 00:54:17,258

Hello, little one.

722
00:56:23,936 --> 00:56:27,934
We took a vote and the computer club
feels your presence...

723
00:56:28,065 --> 00:56:30,224
will be a valuable asset
to our organization.

724
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:33,728
- Computer club. Computer club.
- Computer club.

725
00:56:33,863 --> 00:56:35,939
Homeboy.

726
00:56:39,118 --> 00:56:42,617
Why doesn't that happen
when Matt hits me?

727
00:56:42,747 --> 00:56:45,913
Give yourself
a few million years, David.

728
00:56:58,596 --> 00:57:01,087
Link. Link.
Link, get down.

729
00:57:01,223 --> 00:57:03,263
All right, come on.

730
00:57:03,393 --> 00:57:05,599
No, no.
I was just playin'.

731
00:57:05,728 --> 00:57:07,602
All right, Cro-Magnon Man.

732
00:57:07,730 --> 00:57:10,850
What you're looking at here
is a representation...

733
00:57:10,983 --> 00:57:13,854
of what Cro-Magnon man's everyday life
may have been like.

734
00:57:13,986 --> 00:57:18,150
If he was here today,
you could sit next to him,
you would never know the difference.

735
00:57:18,282 --> 00:57:22,944
Stoney, let's move on.
We're gonna look at the giant sloth.

736
00:58:33,941 --> 00:58:37,144
Class, this is saber-toothed cat.

737
00:58:37,236 --> 00:58:40,237
Even though he's been extinct
for over 10,000 years,

738
00:58:40,365 --> 00:58:42,986
while he was alive you can
imagine that many a caveman...

739
00:58:43,075 --> 00:58:45,532
was a tasty meal to one of these.

740
00:58:47,622 --> 00:58:49,532
- There's one now.
- Uh-oh.

741
00:58:49,624 --> 00:58:54,370
Let's look at the mammoth display,
our school mascot.

742
00:58:55,671 --> 00:58:58,791
- Look out!
- Whoa.

743
00:59:18,110 --> 00:59:20,567
Link! Link, get out from there!

744
00:59:20,696 --> 00:59:22,653
Look at him.
He's flipping out.

745
00:59:22,782 --> 00:59:24,988
- He knows, Dave.
- What?

746
00:59:25,117 --> 00:59:28,071
He knows.

747
00:59:28,162 --> 00:59:31,080
He knows what happened to him.

748
00:59:31,207 --> 00:59:35,916
We have to help him.

749
00:59:36,003 --> 00:59:38,329
Link.

750
00:59:39,799 --> 00:59:41,838
Link. Link.

751
00:59:41,968 --> 00:59:44,044
Ow!

752
00:59:45,179 --> 00:59:47,088
Link.

753
00:59:47,181 --> 00:59:51,095
Hey. Hey, come on, man.
Stop it.

754
00:59:51,227 --> 00:59:53,266
Look, I understand.

755
00:59:54,272 --> 00:59:56,597
Family.

756
00:59:58,402 --> 01:00:00,441
Family.

757
01:00:03,239 --> 01:00:05,113
- Family.
- You okay?

758
01:00:05,241 --> 01:00:07,862
It's okay.
We're your new family.

759
01:00:07,994 --> 01:00:10,486
We're your new family.

760
01:00:10,621 --> 01:00:12,449
It's okay.

761
01:00:18,170 --> 01:00:21,871
It's all right.

762
01:00:24,844 --> 01:00:27,418
He's burnt from all this.

763
01:00:27,556 --> 01:00:31,138
Seeing as we started the school year
as total losers,

764
01:00:31,225 --> 01:00:33,302
and now everyone knows who we are,

765
01:00:33,395 --> 01:00:35,683
I don't think one mistake
is such a big deal.

766
01:00:35,771 --> 01:00:39,391
But you're doggin' him.
Just promise me.

767
01:00:39,526 --> 01:00:42,361
Just a little more mellow?
Not so much?

768
01:00:42,487 --> 01:00:45,690
- Stoney!
- Dave!

769
01:00:45,823 --> 01:00:47,697
All right.

770
01:00:47,825 --> 01:00:51,361
If it'll make you feel better,
I'll be more mellow with him.

771
01:00:51,496 --> 01:00:54,033
- Robyn Sweeney?
- Here.

772
01:00:54,123 --> 01:00:58,868
- Again?
- I'm sorry. I can't get
that parallel parking thing.

773
01:00:59,003 --> 01:01:02,917
Whoa. Parallel parking
is not a thing, understand?

774
01:01:03,049 --> 01:01:07,093
It's not a feeling, not a state of mind,
it's not one of your disco dances.

775
01:01:07,219 --> 01:01:10,387
- Yeah.
- Get in and don't take it personally.

776
01:01:10,515 --> 01:01:12,222
Okay, Mr Beady.

777
01:01:12,351 --> 01:01:14,923
- Linkavitch Chomofsky?
- Ugh, ugh.

778
01:01:15,061 --> 01:01:17,219
What are you lookin' at?

779
01:01:17,356 --> 01:01:18,897
Ugh.

780
01:01:19,023 --> 01:01:22,226
Get inside the car.

781
01:01:22,361 --> 01:01:25,564
And shoot your barber.

782
01:01:25,696 --> 01:01:30,607
Contrast this with Hemingway's
""The Sun Also Rises,""

783
01:01:30,743 --> 01:01:32,652
where the blood sport
of bullfighting...

784
01:01:32,787 --> 01:01:35,788
- is used and perhaps what...
- Uh-oh.

785
01:01:38,502 --> 01:01:41,122
- Oh, God. Rad Mobile!
- Rad Mobile!

786
01:01:41,253 --> 01:01:44,421
Boys, will you sit down?
Class?

787
01:01:44,508 --> 01:01:47,673
You promised me mellow.
This isn't mellow.

788
01:01:49,095 --> 01:01:51,764
Link! Link!

789
01:01:53,683 --> 01:01:55,640
Dave.

790
01:01:55,768 --> 01:01:57,844
Watch the people!
Grab the wheel!

791
01:01:57,979 --> 01:02:00,518
Okay!

792
01:02:03,568 --> 01:02:06,486
- Stone, tell him to stop!
- Okay, stop.

793
01:02:06,612 --> 01:02:09,282
- Didn't phase him, bro.
- Oh, shit!

794
01:02:09,408 --> 01:02:12,610
All right, Link.
Joke's over. Stop!

795
01:02:12,743 --> 01:02:15,780
- He-e-e-ey!
- Stop that car, young man!

796
01:02:15,871 --> 01:02:19,455
I'm your teacher.
Both hands on the wheel!

797
01:02:23,671 --> 01:02:25,546
Who was that?

798
01:02:25,673 --> 01:02:28,164
Crosswalk!
Crosswalk!

799
01:02:31,887 --> 01:02:33,797
Close call, buddy.

800
01:02:33,889 --> 01:02:36,464
Hey, buddy!

801
01:02:36,601 --> 01:02:39,637
- Hi, Robyn.
- Hi, Dave.

802
01:02:41,022 --> 01:02:43,643
- Red light!
- Red light!

803
01:02:50,823 --> 01:02:52,946
Boom!
Up on two wheels!

804
01:02:53,034 --> 01:02:55,988
I've never seen anything like this.
I don't teach that.

805
01:02:56,078 --> 01:03:01,453
I got the license plate.
It's E684-257.

806
01:03:01,543 --> 01:03:04,544
You don't have to write that I left
the keys in the ignition, do you?

807
01:03:04,670 --> 01:03:07,292
Ow-o-o-o-o!

808
01:03:07,382 --> 01:03:10,168
I think he's got the hang of it.

809
01:03:15,181 --> 01:03:20,342
That concludes our parallel parking
for today. Class dismissed.

810
01:03:20,479 --> 01:03:24,523
Link, I think
you just failed Driver's Ed.

811
01:03:24,607 --> 01:03:26,646
Hey, Link, wait up.

812
01:03:26,734 --> 01:03:28,727
Where are we?

813
01:03:28,861 --> 01:03:30,854

01:04:15,409 --> 01:04:18,112
- You wanna be a man?
- Then drink like an hombre.

830
01:04:18,244 --> 01:04:20,782
- No, I can't.
- You're showing us disrespect.

831
01:04:20,913 --> 01:04:22,787
Ah, you guys...

832
01:04:22,915 --> 01:04:25,538
That's disrespectful, weasel.

Dude, do I have to pay for 'em?

844
01:05:18,388 --> 01:05:20,629
- Hey, Stone.
- Hey.

845
01:05:20,765 --> 01:05:24,134
- Where's Link?
- Dancin'.

846
01:05:26,687 --> 01:05:29,095
- Cool, let's go dance.
- No, no.

847
01:05:29,190 --> 01:05:33,188
- I'm not good. Let's not dance.
- You are too uptight.

848
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:35,774
L, I just don't like to dance.

849
01:05:35,863 --> 01:05:38,235

- Hey.

850
01:05:38,367 --> 01:05:40,904

851
01:05:41,035 --> 01:05:43,028
You see that muchacha over there?

852
01:05:43,162 --> 01:05:45,997
- Oh, man, yeah.
- You see her? You see her?

853
01:05:46,123 --> 01:05:48,661
- Don't be lookin' at her, man!
- I'm sorry.

01:05:48,793 --> 01:05:50,666

- No.

855

that man will no longer...

be recognizable as a man.

01:05:57,176 --> 01:06:00,296

Bye, guys. Drive safely.

Nice element you're hanging out with.

- None of your business.

01:10:04,215 --> 01:10:07,382
- Go home.
- Huh.

910
01:10:13,308 --> 01:10:16,558
What time do you want me
to pick you up tomorrow night?

911
01:10:16,644 --> 01:10:19,847
It's the prom, remember?

912
01:10:19,981 --> 01:10:22,602
You are just like everyone else.

Hey, watch it.

916
01:10:31,535 --> 01:10:35,697
Matt, I'm not going
to the prom with you.

917
01:10:37,206 --> 01:10:41,074
I wanna go with somebody
who's really cool,

being himself or having fun.

919
01:10:48,302 --> 01:10:50,626
Good night.

920
01:10:53,014 --> 01:10:55,303
Who's cooler than me?

921
01:10:57,101 --> 01:11:00,850
Your phone call. You got one.
Make it quick.

924
01:11:13,659 --> 01:11:15,534
Hello.

925
01:11:15,661 --> 01:11:17,370
- Robyn?
- Robyn.

926
01:11:17,497 --> 01:11:19,738
Dave, did you guys get away okay?

927
01:11:19,874 --> 01:11:21,831
We're in prison.

928
01:11:21,959 --> 01:11:26,087
Look, this is my one phone call.

929
01:11:26,213 --> 01:11:29,250
I'm using it to ask you
to go to the prom with me.

930
01:11:29,384 --> 01:11:31,257
Just say yes, okay?

931
01:11:31,386 --> 01:11:33,426
No.

932
01:11:33,555 --> 01:11:38,431
- Why not?
- I wanna go with Link.

933
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:41,726
- What?
- Will you ask Link if he'll go with me?

934
01:11:41,854 --> 01:11:43,728
You want me to what?

935
01:11:43,856 --> 01:11:47,688
Look, I'm sorry.
I'll tell you what.

936
01:11:47,777 --> 01:11:50,184
We'll all go.
We'll have a great time.

937
01:11:50,279 --> 01:11:53,197
How about that?

938
01:11:53,325 --> 01:11:55,198
Dave?

939
01:12:42,039 --> 01:12:43,996
Hey!

940
01:12:44,125 --> 01:12:46,581
Ї Como esta usted?
Muy bonita...

941
01:12:46,711 --> 01:12:48,585
es la dia.

942
01:12:48,713 --> 01:12:51,465
Hey, wait.
How was jail?

943
01:12:51,591 --> 01:12:53,465
Did you meet anyone?

944
01:12:53,593 --> 01:12:57,377
Hey, wait!
Wait up.

945
01:13:21,455 --> 01:13:25,617
- Things just didn't turn out right.
- Ugh.

946
01:13:25,708 --> 01:13:29,622
I mean, I don't want 'em cuttin' you up
into little pieces.

947
01:13:29,712 --> 01:13:32,465
This is just what's best for you.

948
01:13:32,591 --> 01:13:34,583
It's best for me too, all right?

949
01:13:34,675 --> 01:13:36,668
Here.

950
01:13:40,097 --> 01:13:42,884
For Rad Mobile.

951
01:13:43,017 --> 01:13:44,891
- For Rad Mobile.
- Yeah.

952
01:13:45,019 --> 01:13:47,309
Put 'em in your pocket.

953
01:13:51,651 --> 01:13:53,809
Don't look at me like that.

954
01:13:53,903 --> 01:13:57,153
This is just the way it's gotta be.

955
01:13:57,281 --> 01:13:59,819
Go on, get out of here.

956
01:14:01,827 --> 01:14:03,820
Go on.

957
01:14:03,955 --> 01:14:07,739
Go on, leave.

958
01:14:07,875 --> 01:14:10,164
Go.

959
01:14:14,048 --> 01:14:16,005
I'm sorry.

960
01:14:18,553 --> 01:14:21,672
Hey, hey, hey!

961
01:14:21,806 --> 01:14:25,306
Talk to me, David.
Let me know what's going on, man.

962
01:14:25,394 --> 01:14:28,726
- What are you doin'?
- I'm letting him go.

963
01:14:28,854 --> 01:14:32,021
- What?
- I can't handle him any more.

964
01:14:32,149 --> 01:14:35,601
- He'll be better off with somebody else.
- No, he's not!

965
01:14:35,736 --> 01:14:37,610
Listen to me.
Call him back.

966
01:14:37,738 --> 01:14:40,526
- I can't take it any more.
- I'm not kiddin'. Call him back.

967
01:14:40,616 --> 01:14:42,526
- It's done, man.
- I'm serious.

968
01:14:42,702 --> 01:14:44,694
Call him back.
That's harsh.

969
01:14:44,787 --> 01:14:46,863
He's not my responsibility.

970
01:14:46,956 --> 01:14:49,364
You're the one who weased off his gig
the whole time...

971
01:14:49,501 --> 01:14:52,336
'cause you thought
maybe he'd get you somewhere.

972
01:14:52,421 --> 01:14:55,255
Now the guy gets a little crusty
and you're gonna bag him.

973
01:14:55,382 --> 01:15:00,377
It's not happenin', Dave. That's not
how it works with friends, man.

974
01:15:00,512 --> 01:15:03,548
You don't bag your friends 'cause they
get in the way, no matter what, dude.

975
01:15:03,639 --> 01:15:07,886
Like you care? The only thing you cared
about is nugs, chillin' and grindage.

976
01:15:07,977 --> 01:15:11,394
- I happen to care right now.
- That's convenient.

977
01:15:11,481 --> 01:15:14,518
You came along for the ride
and let me do the dirty work...

978
01:15:14,609 --> 01:15:16,731
'cause you thought
it might work to your advantage.

979
01:15:16,819 --> 01:15:20,069
Those are desperate words of a loser.

980
01:15:20,197 --> 01:15:21,989
Maybe Matt Wilson
was right about you all along.

981
01:15:22,116 --> 01:15:23,658
Take that back.

982
01:15:23,784 --> 01:15:25,658
- No, you take it back.
- Take it back!

983
01:15:33,794 --> 01:15:35,787
You're a loser.

984
01:15:38,215 --> 01:15:40,837
- Family!
- All right.

985
01:15:43,888 --> 01:15:47,932
- I'm sorry.
- Family.

986
01:15:50,603 --> 01:15:53,010
You can let go, Link.

987
01:15:55,942 --> 01:15:59,394
- I'm sorry, man.
- It's okay.

988
01:15:59,488 --> 01:16:01,610
I don't know what got into me.

989
01:16:01,739 --> 01:16:03,945
I'm sorry.

990
01:16:04,075 --> 01:16:07,409
I didn't mean it, Stoney.

991
01:16:08,287 --> 01:16:10,577
I'm sorry, bud.

992
01:16:13,668 --> 01:16:15,826
Ow!

993
01:16:25,221 --> 01:16:27,628
You look great.

994
01:16:27,723 --> 01:16:30,511
Have a good time.
You deserve it.

995
01:16:33,813 --> 01:16:38,310
- If you touch her...
- Ugh.

996
01:16:38,443 --> 01:16:41,016
- You think they're ready?
- I don't know.

997
01:16:41,153 --> 01:16:43,111
Dave?

998
01:16:43,197 --> 01:16:45,106
Dave, hey.

999
01:16:45,199 --> 01:16:47,359
Hey.

1000
01:16:47,494 --> 01:16:49,651
You're not ready.

1001
01:16:49,745 --> 01:16:51,655
L, I can't go.

1002
01:16:51,789 --> 01:16:56,333
Of course you can.
Just go upstairs, put something on.

1003
01:16:56,420 --> 01:16:59,704
No, really, I can't.
I'm on probation.

1004
01:16:59,839 --> 01:17:01,997
I'm grounded.

1005
01:17:03,843 --> 01:17:06,927
- Hi, Link. You look great.
- Hi.

1006
01:17:07,054 --> 01:17:09,925
You guys go.
Have a good time. Go on.

1007
01:17:10,057 --> 01:17:12,216
- No, no, no. Come on.
- Come on, Dave.

1008
01:17:12,352 --> 01:17:14,225
- Go.
- Are you sure?

1009
01:17:14,354 --> 01:17:16,513
Go, have a good time.
Go, Link.

1010
01:17:16,606 --> 01:17:19,311
Get outta here.
Have a good time.

1011
01:17:19,401 --> 01:17:22,318
Drive safely.

1012
01:17:22,404 --> 01:17:25,238
God, she smells good.

1013
01:17:28,659 --> 01:17:30,866
To Link.

1014
01:17:30,953 --> 01:17:33,990
May he have a cool time at the prom.

1015
01:17:34,081 --> 01:17:36,490
Totally, bro.
To Linkage.

1016
01:17:39,670 --> 01:17:43,668
There's always college.

1017
01:17:43,758 --> 01:17:46,510
Junior college.

1018
01:17:50,349 --> 01:17:53,265
Link, get down here.

1019
01:17:55,354 --> 01:17:57,512
Give me a boost.

1020
01:18:36,894 --> 01:18:39,017
Whoa.

1021
01:18:47,863 --> 01:18:50,105
Gotcha.

1022
01:18:52,201 --> 01:18:55,119
- Dave!
- Stoney, come on!

1023
01:18:56,498 --> 01:18:59,118
Hey, what are you doing?

1024
01:18:59,208 --> 01:19:01,332
Give me back those pictures.

1025
01:19:01,461 --> 01:19:03,371
No!

1026
01:19:03,505 --> 01:19:06,955
- Get back here! They took the Polaroids!
- Uh-oh.

1027
01:19:07,049 --> 01:19:10,798
- Come on.
- Those are our pictures!

1028
01:19:24,191 --> 01:19:27,062
It's unanimous.
The vote for prom king...

1029
01:19:27,194 --> 01:19:29,354
- goes to...
- Wait!

1030
01:19:30,324 --> 01:19:33,110
- What's going on?
- Wait!

1031
01:19:35,036 --> 01:19:36,579
Ugh.

1032
01:19:36,704 --> 01:19:39,990
What are you trying to do?
Come on, stop it.

1033
01:19:43,085 --> 01:19:45,078
This is our school, right?

1034
01:19:45,212 --> 01:19:47,086
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1035
01:19:47,214 --> 01:19:52,007
We have a right to know
if somethin' bogus is goin' down...

1036
01:19:52,094 --> 01:19:53,754
in our school, right?

1037
01:19:53,888 --> 01:19:55,880
- Yeah.
- Right.

1038
01:19:56,015 --> 01:19:59,680
This homey right here
has taken you for a ride.

1039
01:20:01,438 --> 01:20:05,766
His name isn't Linkavitch Chomofsky,
and he's not from Estonia.

1040
01:20:05,900 --> 01:20:09,732
Matt, will you just stop this already?

1041
01:20:09,862 --> 01:20:13,730
Shush! Trust me.

1042
01:20:13,866 --> 01:20:17,366
They've all been lying to us.

1043
01:20:17,496 --> 01:20:20,200
But I found out.

1044
01:20:20,332 --> 01:20:22,371
I know the truth.

1045
01:20:22,501 --> 01:20:26,284
- Do you wanna know the truth?
- Yeah!

1046
01:20:26,421 --> 01:20:30,204
Do you want to know what he really is?

1047
01:20:30,299 --> 01:20:32,208
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1048
01:20:32,302 --> 01:20:34,210
Tell us the secret!

1049
01:20:36,138 --> 01:20:38,261
He's a caveman.

1050
01:20:42,521 --> 01:20:45,189
No. No!

1051
01:20:45,273 --> 01:20:47,432
Look, he's a freak!

1052
01:20:51,654 --> 01:20:55,153
- I got pictures!
- No!

1053
01:20:55,283 --> 01:20:57,406
- See?
- Let me see those pictures.

1054
01:20:57,494 --> 01:21:00,031
Give me back those pictures.
Give me those!

1055
01:21:00,121 --> 01:21:02,577
- No!
- Dave!

1056
01:21:05,710 --> 01:21:08,117
Hmmmm.

1057
01:21:08,254 --> 01:21:10,128
What are you doin', fag?

1058
01:21:23,144 --> 01:21:25,517
Go, go, go!

Watch, watch, watch.

1060
