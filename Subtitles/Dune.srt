1
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:51,920
A beginning
is a very delicate time.

2
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:57,220
Know then, that it is
the year 10,191.

3
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:02,170
The known universe is ruled by the
Padishah Emperor Shaddam the Fourth,

4
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:05,590
my father.

5
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:09,300
In this time, the most
precious substance in the universe...

6
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:12,090
is the spice, melange.

7
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:15,800
The spice extends life.

8
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:20,220
The spice
expands consciousness.

9
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:24,970
The spice is vital
to space travel.

10
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:27,510
The Spacing Guild
and its navigators,

11
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:31,920
who the spice has mutated
over 4,000 years,

12
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:34,670
use the orange spice gas,

13
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:39,090
which gives them
the ability to fold space.

14
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:43,300
That is, travel to any part
of the universe...

15
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,630
without moving.

16
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,630
Oh, yes.

17
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,970
I forgot to tell you.

18
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:55,630
The spice exists on only one planet
in the entire universe.

19
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:01,220
A desolate, dry planet
with vast deserts.

20
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:07,010
Hidden away within the rocks of these
deserts are a people known as the Fremen,

21
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:09,880
who have long
held a prophecy...

22
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:12,510
that a man would come,

23
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,590
a messiah,

24
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:18,550
who would lead them
to true freedom.

25
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:22,220
The planet is Arrakis,

26
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:27,050
also known as Dune.

27
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:56,550
A secret report
within the Guild.

28
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:59,760
Four planets have come
to our attention...

29
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,130
regarding a plot which could
jeopardize spice production.

30
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:08,300
Planet Arrakis,
source of the spice.

31
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:12,550
Planet Caladan,
home of House Atreides.

32
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:17,010
Planet Giedi Prime,
home of House Harkonnen.

33
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:22,090
Planet Kaitain, home of the Emperor
of the known universe.

34
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:27,010
Send a third-stage
guild navigator to Kaitain...

35
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:30,090
to demand details
from the Emperor.

36
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:32,630
The spice must flow.

37
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:22,920
- Father,
- Irulan, you must leave.

38
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,840
A third-stage guild navigator...

39
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,970
will be here within minutes.

40
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,970
We felt his presence.

41
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,300
I shall want telepathy
during his visit...

42
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,420
and a report
when we're finished.

43
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:58,420
I am your Truthsayer,
my lord.

44
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:00,340
He's here, my lord.

45
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:32,010
The Bene Gesserit witch
must leave.

46
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:35,130
Leave us.

47
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:38,050
Yes, my lord.

48
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:50,130
We are alone.

49
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:39,760
- We have just folded space from Ix.
- Yes?

50
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,800
How was your journey?

51
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:49,090
Many machines on Ix.
New machines.

52
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:52,130
Oh? Yes.

53
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:57,470
Better than those on Richese.

54
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:03,300
You are transparent.
I see many things.

55
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:07,800
I see plans within plans.

56
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,420
I see two great houses,

57
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:16,840
House Atreides,
House Harkonnen, feuding.

58
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:21,720
- I see you behind it.
- Yes.

59
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,630
You must share with us.

60
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,880
The Atreides House
is building a secret army...

61
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:30,920
using a technique unknown to us.

62
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,920
A technique involving sound.

63
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:36,840
The duke is becoming
more popular in the Landsraad.

64
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,050
He could threaten me.

65
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:43,010
I have ordered House Atreides
to occupy Arrakis to mine the spice,

66
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:45,880
thus replacing their enemies,
the Harkonnens.

67
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:50,470
House Atreides will not refuse because of the
tremendous power they think they will gain.

68
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,470
Then, at an appointed time,

69
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:55,760
Baron Harkonnen
will return to Arrakis...

70
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,380
and launch a sneak attack
on House Atreides.

71
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:03,380
I have promised the baron five legions
of my Sardaukar terror troops.

72
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:07,970
So the Harkonnens
will rid you of House Atreides.

73
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:09,720
Yes!

74
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,720
One small point.

75
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,090
Here it comes.

76
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:18,550
We ourselves perceive
a slight problem...

77
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:21,300
within House Atreides.

78
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:25,920
Paul. Paul Atreides.

79
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:29,590
You mean, of course,
Duke Leto Atreides, his father.

80
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:33,340
I mean Paul Atreides.

81
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,840
We want him killed.

82
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:43,090
I did not say this.
I am not here.

83
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:45,130
I understand.

84
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:20,470
Why would they want
the duke's son killed?

85
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:29,510
We must have a look
at Paul Atreides, on Caladan.

86
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:48,090
The powerful Bene Gesserit sisterhood
for 90 generations...

87
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:49,970
has been manipulating
bloodlines...

88
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:54,170
to produce the Kwisatz Haderach,
a super being.

89
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:58,260
On Caladan, Jessica,
a member of the sisterhood...

90
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:01,880
and the bound concubine
of Duke Leto Atreides,

91
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:04,970
had been ordered
to bear only daughters.

92
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:06,800
Because of her love
for the duke...

93
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,340
she disobeyed
and gave birth to a son...

94
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:15,880
Paul... Paul Atreides.

95
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:26,550
Here we are now, Caladan.

96
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:32,010
And 19 light-years beyond,
beyond Bene Tleilax.

97
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:35,920
The training planet
of the Mentats, the human computers.

98
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:39,170
Know a Mentat
by his red-stained lips.

99
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,340
There. Arrakis.

100
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,090
Spice mining.

101
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:45,970
Carryalls lower
the harvester to the sand...

102
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:48,510
and lift it off to safety
when a worm attacks.

103
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:52,380
Worms attack
all rhythmic vibrations.

104
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:57,760
Weather. See storms.
No precipitation.

105
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:01,590
Never one drop of rain on Arrakis.

106
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:05,510
And the Harkonnens are near.

107
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:08,670
There. Giedi Prime
and the Baron Harkonnen.

108
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,670
The enemy.

109
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,630
The Baron Harkonnen has sworn
to destroy House Atreides...

110
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,300
and steal the ducal signet ring
for himself.

111
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,920
I know, Thufir.
I'm sitting with my back to the door.

112
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:43,670
I heard you, Dr. Yueh,

113
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,800
and Gurney
coming down the hall.

114
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:49,300
Those sounds
could be imitated!

115
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,260
I'd know the difference.

116
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:57,010
Yes, perhaps you would at that.

117
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:01,550
My father sent you to test me.

118
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:03,800
Music, then?

119
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:08,800
No music.
I'm packing this for the crossing.

120
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,630
- Shield practice.
- Gurney, we had practice this morning.

121
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,630
I'm not in the mood.

122
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,630
Not in the mood!

123
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,170
- Mood's a thing for cattle and love play, not fighting!
- I'm sorry, Gurney.

124
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,550
Not sorry enough.

125
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,760
What's wrong with Gurney?
He's not faking this.

126
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,760
Now, guard yourself for true!

127
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:03,260
Is this what you seek?

128
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:08,340
Good. The slow blade
penetrates the shield.

129
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:11,420
But, uh, look down.

130
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:17,090
We'd have joined each other in death.

131
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:19,920
You did seem finally
to get the mood.

132
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,720
Would you really
have drawn my blood?

133
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,300
If you'd have fought
one whit below your abilities,

134
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:36,260
I'd have given you a good scar
to remind you.

135
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,670
Things have been
so serious here lately.

136
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,840
Soon we leave for Arrakis.

137
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,880
Arrakis is real.

138
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,470
The Harkonnens are real.

139
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:57,590
Dr. Yueh, do you have any information
on the worms of Arrakis?

140
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:01,340
I have obtained a filmbook
of a small specimen.

141
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:04,880
Only 125 meters long.

142
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:07,510
- Only?
- There have been documented sightings...

143
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:12,800
of worms as large as 450 meters
in the deep desert.

144
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:16,510
That's far from where
we'll be in Arrakeen.

145
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:21,260
The desert belt and the south
polar region are marked forbidden.

146
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,510
How do the Fremen survive there?

147
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:25,970
We don't know much
about the Fremen.

148
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:28,800
They live in the deep desert,
some in the cities.

149
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,840
They have blue within blue eyes.

150
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:35,470
Oh, the eyes. Yes.

151
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:38,550
The saturation of the blood
by the spice, melange.

152
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:41,380
Could the spice affect us
in other ways?

153
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:43,630
Many dangers exist on Arrakis.

154
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:47,470
For one, the Harkonnens
would not have given up...

155
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:51,010
their CHOAM Company contract
so easily.

156
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:55,550
The Harkonnens
are our enemies, yes.

157
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:58,090
But behind them, I suspect,
is the Emperor.

158
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,880
You'll make
a formidable duke.

159
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:13,130
Now remember, the first step
in avoiding a trap...

160
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,420
is knowing
of its existence.

161
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:19,550
I know. But if it is a trap,
then why are we going?

162
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:21,590
We have our new army.

163
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:26,590
Dr. Yueh,
put the weirding module on him.

164
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:34,760
Well.

165
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:52,670
Clear and lock the room!

166
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:56,300
Detachment, stand down.

167
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,130
Activate a fighter.

168
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,300
Make the range two meters.

169
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,800
Precise control.

170
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,880
Duncan!

171
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:53,420
Paul. I was just on my way
to say good-bye to you.

172
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:57,220
I have to go on ahead.
I won't be seeing you for a while.

173
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,010
I wish you were
coming with us. Why?

174
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:03,760
Something for your father.
He wants to talk to you.

175
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,670
I'll see you on Arrakis.

176
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,670
May the hand of God
be with you.

177
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,920
May the hand of God
be with us all, Duncan.

178
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:32,380
- Father.
- Thank you for joining me, Paul.

179
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:37,340
Thufir Hawat has served House Atreides
three generations.

180
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:42,510
He swears you are the finest student
he has ever taught.

181
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:45,920
Yueh, Gurney and Duncan
say the same.

182
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:52,550
- Makes me feel very proud.
- I want you to be proud of me.

183
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:07,510
I'll miss the sea.

184
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:12,840
But a person needs
new experiences.

185
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,340
They jar something
deep inside,

186
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:20,550
allowing him to grow.

187
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:26,590
Without change,
something sleeps inside us...

188
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,800
and seldom awakens.

189
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,260
The sleeper must awaken.

190
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:06,090
Arrakis.

191
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:11,130
Dune... Desert planet...

192
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:16,470
I will kill you.

193
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:19,630
The second moon.

194
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,720
Tell me of your home world, Usul.

195
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,800
I know she has come to test him.

196
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,380
No man has ever been tested
with the box.

197
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:52,800
Tonight, I may lose my son.

198
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:21,380
Jessica, you were told to bear
only daughters to the Atreides.

199
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,590
Jessica!

200
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:24,840
It meant so much to him.

201
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:28,760
You thought only of a duke's desire
for a son?

202
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,800
Desires don't come into this.

203
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,800
An Atreides daughter
could have been wed...

204
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:37,090
to a Harkonnen heir
and sealed the breach.

205
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:40,550
We may lose
both bloodlines now.

206
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:46,300
I vowed never
to regret my decision.

207
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:49,800
I'll pay for all my own mistakes.

208
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,590
And your son will pay with you.

209
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:58,840
Arrakis... Dune...
Desert planet.

210
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:04,630
Moving. Moving.

211
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:28,470
We'll salvage what we can.

212
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:32,130
But I can tell you,
dear God...

213
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,800
For the father, nothing.

214
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,420
For the father, nothing?

215
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:40,720
Did you really think you could bear
the Kwisatz Haderach?

216
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:45,970
The universe's super being?
How dare you?

217
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:49,470
My greatest student.

218
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:53,340
And my greatest disappointment.

219
00:23:56,550 --> 00:24:00,800
He's awake.
He's listening to us.

220
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:03,380
Good. Ready yourself,
young Paul Atreides.

221
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:06,720
I want to see you in your mother's
chambers in one quarter of an hour.

222
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:15,470
Paul, this is very important.

223
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:23,260
Kwisatz Haderach. The super being.

224
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:26,090
For the father, nothing.

225
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:41,470
Vas.

226
00:24:56,670 --> 00:25:00,300
This is the Reverend Mother
Gaius Helen Mohiam.

227
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:04,090
She's going to observe you.

228
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:10,420
- Please.
- Jessica,

229
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:12,300
you know it must be done.

230
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:14,840
Your Reverence.

231
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,920
What does she fear?

232
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:20,090
What about my father?

233
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:21,590
Paul.

234
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:25,670
Listen to the Reverend Mother
and do what she tells you.

235
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:37,170
Now you...

236
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:39,170
come here!

237
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:42,300
She's using the Voice.

238
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,300
No.

239
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,880
Some strength there.

240
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:49,220
Surprising.

241
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,300
Come here!

242
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:14,300
Do you see this?

243
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:17,010
Put your right hand
in the box.

244
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:19,010
What's in the box?

245
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:22,880
Pain. Stop!

246
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:25,670
Put your hand in the box.

247
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,590
I hold at your neck
the gom jabbar.

248
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:38,260
This one kills only animals.

249
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:40,720
Are you suggesting
a duke's son is an animal?

250
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:44,420
Let us say I suggest
you may be human.

251
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:48,590
Your awareness may be powerful enough
to control your instincts.

252
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:53,470
Your instinct will be
to remove your hand from the box.

253
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:57,010
If you do so, you die.

254
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:03,970
You will feel...

255
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:08,420
an itching.

256
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:11,170
There.

257
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:15,260
Now the itching becomes...

258
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,260
burning.

259
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,420
Heat upon heat.

260
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:21,470
- Upon heat!
- It burns.

261
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:23,590
Silence! Silence!

262
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:27,300
I must not fear.
Fear is the mind killer.

263
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,920
Fear is the little death
that brings total obliteration.

264
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:31,970
I will face my fear.

265
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:36,010
I will permit it to pass
over me and through me.

266
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:39,970
- I must not fear.
- You feel the flesh crisping?

267
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:43,470
...is the little death
that brings total obliteration.

268
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:47,340
Flesh... dropping off.

269
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:50,970
Fear is the little... death!

270
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:53,010
I must not fear.

271
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:55,800
Fear is the little death.

272
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,840
I'm...

273
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:00,970
- The pain!
- No!

274
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:02,550
Enough.

275
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:10,590
Kull wahad. No woman child
ever withstood that much.

276
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,880
Take your hand out of the box
and look at it,

277
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,880
young human.

278
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:22,880
Do it!

279
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:30,840
Pain by nerve induction.

280
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,760
A human can resist any pain.

281
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,630
Our test is crisis
and observation.

282
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,050
I see the truth of it.

283
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:41,920
Could he be the one? Maybe.

284
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:44,840
But will he be
ours to control?

285
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:49,380
Tell me of your home world, Usul.

286
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:56,260
Do you know
of the Water of Life?

287
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:59,840
The bile from the newborn worms
of Arrakis?

288
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,420
- I have heard of it.
- It is very dangerous.

289
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:07,920
The Bene Gesserit sisterhood
use it to see within.

290
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:12,760
There is a place
terrifying to us,

291
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,010
to women.

292
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:20,720
It is said
a man will come,

293
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,920
the Kwisatz Haderach.

294
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:28,420
He will go
where we cannot.

295
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:30,970
Many men have tried.

296
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:32,970
They tried and failed?

297
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:35,920
They tried and died.

298
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:38,300
Jessica.

299
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:48,630
My son lives.

300
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:54,800
I sense your teachings in him.

301
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,510
Ignore the regular order
of training.

302
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:00,510
His safety requires the Voice.

303
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,510
I've heard enough of my safety.

304
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:04,920
What about my father?

305
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:06,970
I heard your talking.

306
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:10,340
You speak as if he were dead.
Well, he's not.

307
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:13,050
And he won't die.
Tell me he won't die.

308
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:17,420
- What can be done has been done.
- Mother, tell me.

309
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:46,590
Message for Mentat Piter De Vries.

310
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:49,590
The Baron is impatient
for Leto's reply.

311
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:54,720
It is by will alone
I set my mind in motion.

312
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,220
It is by the juice of Sapho
that thoughts acquire speed,

313
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,720
the lips acquire stains,
the stains become a warning.

314
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,380
It is by will alone
I set my mind in motion.

315
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,050
It is by will alone
I set my mind in motion.

316
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:10,380
It is by the juice of Sapho
that thoughts acquire speed,

317
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:12,920
the lips acquire stains,
the stains become a warning.

318
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:15,300
It is by will alone
I set my mind in motion.

319
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:19,970
My lord.

320
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:21,970
Piter.

321
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,590
The Atreides will be leaving
Caladan soon, Baron,

322
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:28,590
and I have here your answer
from Duke Leto.

323
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:31,470
What does Leto say, Piter?

324
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:37,170
He wishes to inform you that "vendetta,"
as he puts it, using the ancient tongue,

325
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:40,260
the art of Kanly,
is still alive.

326
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:43,590
He does not wish to meet
or speak with you.

327
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:48,170
I've made my peace gesture.

328
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:50,800
The forms of Kanly
have been obeyed!

329
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,340
Bring in Feyd and Rabban.

330
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:23,880
As you instructed me,

331
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:27,420
I have enlightened your nephews
concerning my plan...

332
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:29,970
My plan!

333
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:34,590
The plan...
to crush the Atreides.

334
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,720
Feyd.

335
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,720
Rabban.

336
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:43,090
Go quietly.

337
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:46,970
No other great house
of the Landsraad...

338
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:51,470
must ever know of the Emperor's aid
to the Baron.

339
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:55,970
The entire Landsraad
would turn against the Baron...

340
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:58,130
and the Emperor.

341
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:01,260
Put the pick in there, Pete,

342
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:04,970
and turn it 'round real neat.

343
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,720
Ahhh.

344
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:29,470
You are so beautiful, my Baron.

345
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:34,090
Your skin, love to me.

346
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:37,340
Your diseases,
lovingly cared for...

347
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:39,880
for all eternity.

348
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:48,670
I will have Arrakis back for myself.

349
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:52,800
He who controls the spice
controls the universe!

350
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,090
And what Piter
did not tell you...

351
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:58,420
is we have control
of someone who is very close,

352
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:01,920
very close to Duke Leto.

353
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:04,260
This person, this traitor,

354
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:08,130
will be worth more to us
than ten legions of Sardaukar!

355
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:10,970
And who is this traitor?

356
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:13,800
I won't tell you who the traitor is...

357
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:16,380
or when we'll attack.

358
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:20,550
However, the duke will die
before these eyes,

359
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:24,130
and he'll know,
he'll know that it is I,

360
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:28,170
Baron Vladimir Harkonnen,
who encompasses his doom!

361
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:39,590
Ha, ha! Ha, ha!

362
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:49,470
This is what I'll do
to the duke and his family.

363
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:30,800
Oh, I'll miss Caladan so much.

364
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:58,380
Caladan.

365
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:53,010
Soon they will begin
to fold space.

366
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:57,840
Far off
in the control rooms of spice gas...

367
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,470
traveling... without moving.

368
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:23,340
And now, the prophecy.

369
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:28,050
One will come.

370
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:31,880
The voice from the outer world,

371
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,050
bringing the holy war,

372
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:39,880
the jihad, which will
cleanse the universe...

373
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:44,090
and bring us
out of darkness.

374
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:15,300
House Atreides took control
of Arrakis 63 standard days...

375
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:18,590
into the year 10,191.

376
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:22,130
It was known that the Harkonnens,
the former rulers of Arrakis,

377
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:26,340
would leave
many suicide troops behind.

378
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:28,760
Atreides patrols were doubled.

379
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:42,760
Duncan.

380
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:48,220
What have you discovered
about the Fremen, Duncan?

381
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:51,760
Tell me. Why haven't
we heard from you?

382
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:55,130
My lord, I suspect so much.

383
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,300
I think they
are the allies we seek.

384
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:01,300
They are strong, fierce.

385
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:04,220
They do not give their loyalty
easily or quickly.

386
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:09,340
As you know, the Imperium has never been
able to take a census of the Fremen.

387
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:12,840
Everyone thinks that there are but few
wandering here and there in the desert.

388
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:15,880
My lord,

389
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,970
I suspect an incredible secret
has been kept on this planet,

390
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:22,880
that the Fremen exist
in vast numbers...

391
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,970
vast...

392
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:29,550
and it is they
who control Arrakis.

393
00:43:36,970 --> 00:43:38,840
Each trooper
will be charged with responsibility...

394
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,840
for preserving water.

395
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,260
Our existence
as an operating army...

396
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:46,050
depends on these following
water-saving procedures.

397
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:48,880
Remember, water is life.

398
00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:56,300
Why is the shield not yet up?

399
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:59,720
Sir, we found and removed
another sabotage device.

400
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,760
I think it'll
go up now, sir.

401
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:06,630
...armed forces prospects
for rehabilitation are good.

402
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,720
We're finding
these sabotage devices too easily.

403
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:22,880
House shield activating.

404
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:35,420
Duke Leto is now here. Spice mining
inspection to start immediately.

405
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:54,300
So you are Dr. Kynes,

406
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:56,420
the Judge of the change.

407
00:44:56,470 --> 00:45:00,840
- And the Imperial Ecologist, sire.
- Our intelligence informs us...

408
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:03,550
that there's still
a strong Harkonnen presence.

409
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:05,800
The process of removal continues.

410
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:08,260
This is my son, Paul.

411
00:45:10,130 --> 00:45:12,720
- Are you a Fremen?
- I've been on Arrakis...

412
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,550
in the service of the Emperor
long enough for my eyes to change.

413
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:17,800
In the service of the Emperor.

414
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,800
We are in your hands, Doctor.

415
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:22,760
Your gift of the stillsuits
is much appreciated.

416
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:25,300
Will you give us an explanation
of their workings?

417
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:29,470
Well, this is a stillsuit
of Fremen manufacture,

418
00:45:29,550 --> 00:45:31,470
the most efficient type
on Arrakis.

419
00:45:31,550 --> 00:45:33,880
Basically...

420
00:45:36,010 --> 00:45:38,130
It's all right, Gurney.

421
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:40,420
Yes, sire.

422
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:43,470
Basically,

423
00:45:43,550 --> 00:45:47,510
it's a high efficiency
filter and heat exchange system.

424
00:45:47,590 --> 00:45:50,840
Perspiration passes through
the first layer,

425
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,970
and is gathered
in the second,

426
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:55,380
where salt is separated.

427
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:59,550
Breathing and walking
provide the pumping action.

428
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:03,340
The reclaimed water
circulates to catch pockets...

429
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:06,630
from which you can drink
through this tube...

430
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,720
at your neck.

431
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:12,420
Urine and feces are processed
in the thigh pads.

432
00:46:12,510 --> 00:46:15,920
Should you be
in the open desert,

433
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:18,340
remember to breathe in
through your mouth...

434
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:20,970
and out through
this nose tube.

435
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:23,720
With a Fremen suit
in good working condition,

436
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:26,050
life can be sustained
for weeks,

437
00:46:26,090 --> 00:46:30,220
even in the deep desert, sire.

438
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:32,260
My thanks.

439
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:34,260
With your permission.

440
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:40,220
- You've worn a stillsuit before.
- No.

441
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:43,050
Your suit is fitted
desert fashion.

442
00:46:43,130 --> 00:46:46,590
- Who told you how to do that?
- No one.

443
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:48,590
It seemed the proper way.

444
00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:53,880
That it is.

445
00:46:53,970 --> 00:46:59,010
He shall know your ways
as if born to them.

446
00:46:59,090 --> 00:47:01,670
We're wasting time, sire.

447
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:20,420
Battle language?
Translate it.

448
00:47:23,470 --> 00:47:25,670
Very faint.

449
00:47:30,050 --> 00:47:32,260
Harkonnen!

450
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:40,130
Airspeed: zero five.

451
00:47:40,170 --> 00:47:44,380
Ambient temperature:
300 degrees kelvin.

452
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:46,420
Airspeed: three zero.

453
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:02,920
That's where I told your sandmaster
to concentrate the harvesting today.

454
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:06,170
Southeast, over the shield wall.

455
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:13,340
Ambient temperature: 350 degrees kelvin.

456
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:15,800
Airspeed: one three zero.

457
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:21,010
Caution: You've now cleared
protective shield wall...

458
00:48:21,050 --> 00:48:23,670
and entered open desert.

459
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:34,220
Will we see a worm?

460
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:38,260
Where there's spice and spice mining,
there are always worms.

461
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:41,220
- Always.
- Always.

462
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:43,220
Why do they come?

463
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:45,800
To protect their territory.

464
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:48,090
Vibrations attract them.

465
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:50,300
He must be a Fremen,

466
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:52,300
or in with them.

467
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:54,300
He's studying us.

468
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:56,920
He's hiding something
about the spice.

469
00:48:57,010 --> 00:48:59,510
Is there a relationship
between the worms and the spice?

470
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:06,630
As I said,
they defend the spice sand.

471
00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:10,590
As to their relationship
with the spice,

472
00:49:10,670 --> 00:49:12,630
who knows?

473
00:49:28,470 --> 00:49:30,380
My message. It's here.

474
00:49:34,590 --> 00:49:39,840
There are more enemy bodies coming in
for your inspection, Doctor Yueh.

475
00:49:44,130 --> 00:49:48,130
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

476
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:50,630
Thank you, Thufir.

477
00:49:54,170 --> 00:49:57,720
- Dust cloud ahead, sire.
- That's it. Spice mining.

478
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:01,220
No other cloud quite like it.

479
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:07,590
Wormsign. Is it wormsign?

480
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:10,260
Yes. Worm. Big one.

481
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:12,720
You've got sharp eyes.
May I?

482
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:19,220
Calling Harvester Pad Nine.
Wormsign.

483
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:21,300
Who calls Pad Nine?

484
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:24,420
Don't mention the duke.
This is an uncoded channel.

485
00:50:24,510 --> 00:50:29,050
Unlisted flight northeast of you.
Wormsign on intercept course.

486
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:32,050
Estimated contact: 15 minutes.

487
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:34,670
Have sighting confirmed.
Stand by for fix.

488
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:37,470
Contact in 16 minutes minus.

489
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:40,800
Very precise estimate.
Who's on that unlisted flight?

490
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:49,170
- What happens now?
- The carryall will come and lift off the spice harvester.

491
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:51,800
Try to get in close
over the harvester.

492
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:56,630
You'll find this interesting, sire.
They'll work until the very last minute.

493
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,260
Spotter control,
there's no sign of the carryall.

494
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:01,260
It isn't answering.

495
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:04,300
The worm is eight minutes away, sire.

496
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:06,800
Spotter control,
give me a report by the numbers.

497
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:09,550
- Report One.
- No contact.

498
00:51:09,630 --> 00:51:11,630
- Report Two.
- Negative.

499
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:13,880
- Report Three.
- Negative, sir.

500
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:17,590
- Report Four.
- No contact.

501
00:51:17,670 --> 00:51:19,590
I think they've got
our carryall.

502
00:51:19,670 --> 00:51:21,840
Damn it.
Harkonnens.

503
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:26,590
We are coming down to take you off the
harvester. All spotters are ordered to comply.

504
00:51:26,670 --> 00:51:29,220
- Ordered by whom?
- Duke Leto Atreides.

505
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:32,800
- Yes. Yes, sire.
- How many men do you have?

506
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,920
Full crew, 26 men.

507
00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:37,300
But, sire, we can't
leave all this spice.

508
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:39,920
Damn the spice!
Get out of there!

509
00:51:49,470 --> 00:51:52,170
Two men in each of the spoilers!

510
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:57,050
You, over here! Run! Run!

511
00:52:02,010 --> 00:52:04,630
I can't see him yet,
but he's very close.

512
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:08,340
Damn sloppy.
Really damn sloppy.

513
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:10,340
Come on, boys, come on!

514
00:52:13,550 --> 00:52:15,510
We're going to be heavy, sire.

515
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:18,550
Spice.

516
00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:22,260
Pure, unrefined spice.

517
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:30,800
Here it is! We've got to go!

518
00:52:40,050 --> 00:52:43,970
Bless the maker and his water.
Bless the coming and going of him.

519
00:52:44,010 --> 00:52:47,800
- May his passing cleanse the world.
- What's that you're saying?

520
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:49,800
Nothing.

521
00:53:25,630 --> 00:53:27,800
Gods, what a monster!

522
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:40,220
Someone is going to pay for this,
I promise.

523
00:53:43,090 --> 00:53:46,670
He's more concerned
over his men than the spice.

524
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:51,300
I must admit,
against all better judgment,

525
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:53,550
I like this duke.

526
00:54:39,050 --> 00:54:42,130
Milady, the local people,

527
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:45,050
the maids and servants,
await your inspection.

528
00:54:45,130 --> 00:54:48,130
Hawat has cleared them.

529
00:54:51,010 --> 00:54:53,340
Excuse me, milady.

530
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:57,800
The Harkonnens may have
tampered with them medically.

531
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:08,760
When you said Harkonnens,

532
00:55:10,630 --> 00:55:13,300
I didn't know you had
so much reason to hate them.

533
00:55:17,010 --> 00:55:19,050
My wife...

534
00:55:20,630 --> 00:55:24,170
But of course, you didn't know my wife.

535
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:27,340
The Hark...

536
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:29,510
Forgive me.

537
00:55:29,550 --> 00:55:31,510
They must have killed her.

538
00:55:31,550 --> 00:55:36,010
Please excuse me
if I can't talk about it.

539
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:41,920
He's holding something back.

540
00:55:42,010 --> 00:55:43,920
Yet...

541
00:55:44,010 --> 00:55:47,260
There's the Imperial Conditioning.

542
00:55:48,590 --> 00:55:50,550
Assurance of trust.

543
00:55:57,130 --> 00:56:01,050
The Bene Gesserit mother. The legend.

544
00:56:01,090 --> 00:56:04,130
Where is your son?

545
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:08,050
I must warn you,
you are in great danger.

546
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:12,720
Safe.

547
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:30,970
Spice.

548
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:50,300
What is it doing to me?

549
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,720
Second moon.

550
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:08,130
The sleeper must awaken.

551
00:57:09,090 --> 00:57:11,090
Am I the one?

552
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:26,840
A hunter seeker.

553
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,880
Can't get me if I don't move.

554
00:57:30,050 --> 00:57:33,670
It's too dark in here
for it to see clearly.

555
00:57:49,010 --> 00:57:51,760
I've got to try to grab it.

556
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:54,470
Suspensor field will make it
slippery on the bottom.

557
00:57:54,550 --> 00:57:58,380
I must grip it tightly.

558
00:57:58,470 --> 00:58:01,220
Who is operating that thing?

559
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:05,260
It has to be someone
in the palace.

560
00:58:05,340 --> 00:58:09,590
I could shout for help, but it would
kill whoever opened the door.

561
00:58:26,380 --> 00:58:30,050
Hold still.

562
00:58:52,050 --> 00:58:55,970
It would have killed me.

563
00:58:56,050 --> 00:59:00,090
I was its target.
It went to the motion.

564
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:02,260
Who are you?

565
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:06,880
I am the Shadout Mapes,
the housekeeper.

566
00:59:06,970 --> 00:59:10,800
I must cleanse
the way between us.

567
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:15,550
You saved my life,
and we Fremen pay our debts.

568
00:59:15,630 --> 00:59:17,800
A Fremen.

569
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:21,630
It is known to us that you've
a traitor in your midst.

570
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:24,170
Who it is, we cannot say.

571
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:27,340
But we are certain of it.

572
00:59:36,630 --> 00:59:38,590
A traitor.

573
00:59:38,670 --> 00:59:42,220
Let's go, guys!

574
00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:52,920
Set up a sonar probe immediately.

575
00:59:53,010 --> 00:59:56,380
Over here!

576
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:02,840
Harkonnen.

577
01:00:05,670 --> 01:00:09,300
They have tried
to take the life of my son.

578
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:16,220
Sector six through 80,
progress reports, sire.

579
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:18,720
Take it, Thufir.

580
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:22,970
Sector six, 80, copy the sixth,
the sum of the eighth,

581
01:00:23,050 --> 01:00:27,380
the quadrant over the ninth, plus 80, four
circles, weave the 80 and call the fourth.

582
01:00:27,470 --> 01:00:28,880
Copy.

583
01:00:32,970 --> 01:00:37,010
Eight, Thufir Hawat,
Mentat, Master of Assassins.

584
01:00:38,090 --> 01:00:42,720
The, uh, the palace
is now secure.

585
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:46,550
The city of Arrakeen
is under martial law.

586
01:00:46,590 --> 01:00:51,300
We have troops here,
headquartered underground,

587
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:53,550
on subfloors six through ten.

588
01:00:53,630 --> 01:00:56,340
The rest of the troops
are stationed in Arrakeen,

589
01:00:56,420 --> 01:00:58,840
and we have some
on the airfield.

590
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:01,300
Our new army
is still in training,

591
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:03,880
but everything,
everything is shielded,

592
01:01:03,970 --> 01:01:07,760
and with this shielding,
we are impenetrable.

593
01:02:00,170 --> 01:02:02,800
Sleep well, my son.

594
01:02:15,470 --> 01:02:19,050
Father... drugged.

595
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:28,300
Jessica, what is wrong?

596
01:02:28,340 --> 01:02:31,590
Forgive me,
my beloved concubine.

597
01:02:31,670 --> 01:02:35,340
I should have married you.

598
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:41,010
Why hold a dream to ascend to a throne
through a political marriage?

599
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:43,840
I should have married you.

600
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:10,760
What happened?

601
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:33,260
Yueh!

602
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:37,470
He sabotaged the house generators.
We are wide open!

603
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:44,550
House shield deactivating.

604
01:03:44,630 --> 01:03:47,220
I've destroyed the new army's
weirding modules.

605
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:50,090
I've brought
House Atreides down.

606
01:03:50,170 --> 01:03:52,800
- Why?
- I wish to kill a man.

607
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:57,800
Not you, my dear Duke.
You were already dead.

608
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:01,050
But you'll get close
to the baron before you die.

609
01:04:01,130 --> 01:04:04,670
You'll be tied and drugged,
but you can still attack.

610
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:07,170
You can still attack!

611
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:10,090
When you see the baron,

612
01:04:10,130 --> 01:04:13,760
you'll have
a new poison gas tooth.

613
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:17,760
He'll want you close
so he can gloat over you.

614
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:20,800
One bite on this tooth,

615
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:23,220
and a strong exhale...

616
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:26,590
- Refuse.
- No, you mustn't!

617
01:04:26,670 --> 01:04:32,090
Because, in return, I'll save
the lives of your Paul and Jessica.

618
01:04:37,510 --> 01:04:39,420
For Paul.

619
01:04:43,010 --> 01:04:44,920
Oh!

620
01:04:54,170 --> 01:04:57,840
When you see the baron,
remember the tooth.

621
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:01,670
The tooth. The tooth!

622
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:05,720
- The shield is down!
The shield is down!

623
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:10,170
Open the doors!

624
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:12,260
Signals!

625
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:18,420
- Get that shield up!
- The shield! The shield!

626
01:05:42,630 --> 01:05:45,590
The weirding modules. Destroyed!

627
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:36,630
Long live Duke Leto!

628
01:06:59,170 --> 01:07:01,880
The drug was timed.

629
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:08,010
Dr. Yueh has been
very valuable to us.

630
01:07:10,220 --> 01:07:14,380
What a pity
you must remain gagged.

631
01:07:14,470 --> 01:07:19,380
We can't let ourselves be swayed
by your witch's voice now, can we?

632
01:07:19,470 --> 01:07:22,720
Leto, where are you?

633
01:07:24,510 --> 01:07:27,050
How simple to subdue us.

634
01:07:40,010 --> 01:07:42,800
Good-bye, Jessica.

635
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:45,880
And good-bye
to your sweet son.

636
01:07:45,970 --> 01:07:48,880
I want to spit once on your head.

637
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:52,170
Just some spittle in your face.

638
01:07:55,090 --> 01:07:57,380
What a luxury.

639
01:08:02,670 --> 01:08:05,550
We were ordered
to kill them, so kill them.

640
01:08:09,300 --> 01:08:12,220
I wish this was Paul.

641
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:21,420
I knew Yueh's wife.

642
01:08:23,340 --> 01:08:27,090
I was the one who broke
his Imperial Conditioning.

643
01:08:31,970 --> 01:08:35,090
I've thought of many pleasures
with you.

644
01:08:36,670 --> 01:08:41,630
It is perhaps better that you die
in the innards of a worm.

645
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:54,630
What are your orders, Piter?

646
01:08:54,670 --> 01:08:58,630
Take them to the desert
as the traitor suggested.

647
01:08:58,670 --> 01:09:01,670
The worms will destroy the evidence.

648
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:04,670
Their bodies must never be found.

649
01:09:18,470 --> 01:09:21,420
They're down on this floor somewhere.
Down there.

650
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:42,720
Duncan!

651
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:48,880
Yaaah!

652
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:52,380
Yaaaah!

653
01:09:52,470 --> 01:09:57,010
You wish now to join your wife?
Is that it, traitor?

654
01:09:57,090 --> 01:09:59,010
She lives?

655
01:09:59,050 --> 01:10:01,920
You wish to join her?

656
01:10:05,090 --> 01:10:07,010
Join her.

657
01:10:14,010 --> 01:10:17,170
You think you've defeated me?

658
01:10:20,050 --> 01:10:24,720
You think I don't know what
I gained... for my wife?

659
01:10:31,050 --> 01:10:32,970
Take him away.

660
01:10:54,550 --> 01:10:57,010
Yueh's sign.

661
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:03,590
He's left us stillsuits.

662
01:11:10,470 --> 01:11:13,220
Don't touch my mother!

663
01:11:13,300 --> 01:11:15,220
He's trying the Voice.

664
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:17,260
The Reverend Mother
said it could save him.

665
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:19,340
Did you hear a noise
from the little one?

666
01:11:19,420 --> 01:11:23,800
Huh? I didn't hear anything.

667
01:11:26,130 --> 01:11:29,170
The little one.

668
01:11:41,510 --> 01:11:43,590
Remove her gag.

669
01:11:43,670 --> 01:11:45,720
Excellent.

670
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:54,340
Remove her gag.

671
01:12:01,340 --> 01:12:04,550
There's no need to fight over me.

672
01:12:04,630 --> 01:12:08,470
There's no need to fight...

673
01:12:15,550 --> 01:12:17,880
A poisoned blade.

674
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:31,470
First... cut my son's bonds.

675
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:41,970
That's it.

676
01:12:53,670 --> 01:12:55,840
Oh, my God!

677
01:13:05,170 --> 01:13:07,590
It's under control.

678
01:13:35,550 --> 01:13:40,170
Duke Leto Atreides.

679
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:47,510
Where is the ducal signet ring?

680
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:50,800
I must have his ring.

681
01:13:52,970 --> 01:13:55,510
The ring!

682
01:13:57,470 --> 01:14:00,090
He was brought to us
as is, my lord Baron.

683
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:06,300
You killed the doctor
too soon, you fool!

684
01:14:06,380 --> 01:14:10,670
The doctor, Yueh. What did he say?

685
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:15,260
Paul and Jessica safe.
Yes! The tooth!

686
01:14:15,340 --> 01:14:17,760
He's coming around, Baron.

687
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:20,590
Where's your ring?

688
01:14:20,630 --> 01:14:23,920
Huh? You do not answer?

689
01:14:23,970 --> 01:14:26,260
Wait. Wait.

690
01:14:26,340 --> 01:14:29,340
You must come closer.

691
01:14:29,420 --> 01:14:32,090
The water...

692
01:14:32,170 --> 01:14:34,920
of my life...

693
01:14:35,010 --> 01:14:37,260
for Paul.

694
01:14:37,340 --> 01:14:41,510
He's crying. He's crying!

695
01:14:41,590 --> 01:14:44,550
What does that mean, Piter?

696
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:50,510
Come closer, Baron.

697
01:14:57,670 --> 01:15:01,170
Jessica! Paul!

698
01:15:01,260 --> 01:15:05,470
Leto! Leto, he's dead!

699
01:15:05,550 --> 01:15:08,840
Oh, he's dead!

700
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:11,970
I know.

701
01:15:18,050 --> 01:15:20,510
Am I alive?

702
01:15:22,010 --> 01:15:24,670
- I'm alive?
- Yes.

703
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:27,920
You're alive, my Baron.

704
01:15:28,010 --> 01:15:30,510
I'm alive, eh?

705
01:15:30,550 --> 01:15:34,420
I'm alive!
I am alive!

706
01:15:34,470 --> 01:15:38,170
I'm alive!

707
01:15:45,010 --> 01:15:47,220
I can't maintain any altitude.

708
01:15:47,260 --> 01:15:50,720
We'll never reach
the safety of rock.

709
01:15:53,970 --> 01:15:56,130
Maybe that small rock.

710
01:15:56,220 --> 01:15:58,340
Where are we,
do you think?

711
01:15:58,420 --> 01:16:02,510
The south polar regions.
The forbidden area.

712
01:16:02,590 --> 01:16:05,380
Hold on.

713
01:16:13,260 --> 01:16:15,170
Hurry!

714
01:16:17,260 --> 01:16:19,510
Take the stillsuits.

715
01:16:20,630 --> 01:16:23,550
Hurry! This crash
might bring a worm.

716
01:16:29,260 --> 01:16:31,170
The signet.

717
01:16:31,260 --> 01:16:34,550
A million deaths
are not enough for Yueh.

718
01:16:56,880 --> 01:17:01,170
Where are my feelings?
I feel for no one.

719
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:08,090
The second moon.

720
01:17:23,050 --> 01:17:26,630
I mean Paul Atreides.

721
01:17:26,670 --> 01:17:29,170
We want him killed.

722
01:17:29,260 --> 01:17:33,510
Why? Why do they want me killed?

723
01:17:33,550 --> 01:17:37,550
It has to be something
to do with the spice.

724
01:17:37,630 --> 01:17:39,670
But what?

725
01:17:44,970 --> 01:17:49,340
He who controls the spice
controls the universe!

726
01:17:57,050 --> 01:18:00,170
This moon holds my future.

727
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:16,470
Never one drop of rain on Arrakis.

728
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:23,510
The sleeper must awaken.

729
01:18:32,050 --> 01:18:36,340
They will call me Muad'Dib.

730
01:18:43,050 --> 01:18:46,880
Listen to me. Listen.

731
01:18:46,970 --> 01:18:49,920
You wanted to know
about my dreams.

732
01:18:50,010 --> 01:18:52,800
Well, I've just had
a waking dream.

733
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:55,630
Do you know why?

734
01:18:55,720 --> 01:18:59,800
The spice!
It's in everything here.

735
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:02,010
Calm yourself.

736
01:19:02,090 --> 01:19:07,130
Like the Truthsayer drug.
It's a poison.

737
01:19:07,220 --> 01:19:11,170
You knew the spice
would change me.

738
01:19:11,220 --> 01:19:15,670
But thanks to your teachings,
it's changing my consciousness.

739
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:18,470
I see it!
I can see it!

740
01:19:18,550 --> 01:19:21,170
Is he the one?

741
01:19:21,260 --> 01:19:25,010
You carry my unborn sister
in your womb.

742
01:19:25,090 --> 01:19:27,590
He knows.

743
01:19:37,670 --> 01:19:39,590
Father!

744
01:19:43,170 --> 01:19:49,090
Father, I promise one day
the sleeper will awaken,

745
01:19:49,170 --> 01:19:53,010
and I will avenge your death.

746
01:19:53,050 --> 01:19:58,880
I will not stop until I destroy
the emperor and the baron.

747
01:20:03,970 --> 01:20:05,880
Father.

748
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:24,550
Go now.

749
01:20:24,630 --> 01:20:28,800
Take him to his desert...
to die.

750
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:31,880
Go.

751
01:21:03,630 --> 01:21:06,510
Yueh's left the plan
for the weirding modules.

752
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:20,920
We have to get to
that mountain of rock.

753
01:21:21,010 --> 01:21:25,420
We have entered the time when all
will turn against us and seek our lives.

754
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:44,800
It's further than I thought.

755
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:47,470
A worm is sure to come.

756
01:21:49,340 --> 01:21:52,800
I'll plant this thumper.
That should divert it.

757
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:23,970
Remember, walk without rhythm,

758
01:22:24,010 --> 01:22:25,920
and we won't attract a worm.

759
01:22:26,010 --> 01:22:28,260
It will go to the thumper.

760
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:31,800
I'm ready.

761
01:23:12,590 --> 01:23:14,840
Faster!

762
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:18,220
It's deafening!

763
01:24:33,470 --> 01:24:36,220
The spice.

764
01:24:38,170 --> 01:24:41,010
- Do you smell it?
- Yes!

765
01:24:48,670 --> 01:24:51,010
Paul!

766
01:25:06,010 --> 01:25:07,920
Paul!

767
01:25:17,630 --> 01:25:20,420
A thumper.

768
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:33,300
The worm! Spice!
Is there a relationship?

769
01:25:46,340 --> 01:25:48,760
What's happened?

770
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:51,800
Why did it leave?

771
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:55,380
Someone started
another thumper.

772
01:25:55,470 --> 01:25:58,510
We're not alone.

773
01:26:28,590 --> 01:26:30,510
Man-carved steps.

774
01:26:30,590 --> 01:26:32,510
Yes.

775
01:26:45,260 --> 01:26:47,670
Such stealth.

776
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:49,720
I didn't hear them.

777
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:53,170
Perhaps these are the ones
the Shadout Mapes told us of.

778
01:26:53,220 --> 01:26:55,670
I will take the boy-man.

779
01:26:55,760 --> 01:26:58,720
He shall have sanctuary
in my tribe.

780
01:27:06,670 --> 01:27:08,800
Stop! Get back!

781
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:11,300
She has the weirding way.

782
01:27:13,720 --> 01:27:15,840
Great gods!

783
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:18,800
If you can do this
to the strongest of us,

784
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:21,840
you're worth ten times
your weight of water.

785
01:27:24,300 --> 01:27:28,510
As the leader of my people,
I give you my bond.

786
01:27:28,550 --> 01:27:31,220
Teach us this weirding way,

787
01:27:31,300 --> 01:27:34,800
and you both
shall have sanctuary.

788
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:38,300
Your water shall mingle
with our water.

789
01:27:38,380 --> 01:27:42,300
Then I will teach you
our way of battle.

790
01:27:46,260 --> 01:27:49,380
I give you the word bond
of a Bene Gesserit.

791
01:27:49,470 --> 01:27:51,630
It is the legend.

792
01:27:57,470 --> 01:28:01,130
I am Chani,
daughter of Liet.

793
01:28:01,220 --> 01:28:05,840
I would not have permitted you
to harm my tribe.

794
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:11,550
From my dreams. So beautiful.

795
01:28:11,630 --> 01:28:14,970
Come with me.
I'll show you an easier way down.

796
01:28:33,420 --> 01:28:36,420
You have strength.

797
01:28:36,470 --> 01:28:39,050
You shall be known as Usul,

798
01:28:39,130 --> 01:28:41,840
which is the strength
of the base of the pillar.

799
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:44,920
This is your secret name
in our troop,

800
01:28:45,010 --> 01:28:48,300
but you must choose
the name of manhood...

801
01:28:48,380 --> 01:28:51,590
which we will call you openly.

802
01:28:53,880 --> 01:28:57,220
What do you call the mouse shadow
in the second moon?

803
01:28:59,300 --> 01:29:03,130
We call that one Muad'Dib.

804
01:29:03,170 --> 01:29:06,550
Could I be known
as Paul Muad'Dib?

805
01:29:06,630 --> 01:29:10,260
You are Paul Muad'Dib.

806
01:29:10,340 --> 01:29:14,760
And your mother shall be
a Sayyadina among us.

807
01:29:14,840 --> 01:29:17,630
We welcome you.

808
01:29:17,670 --> 01:29:21,090
A dream unfolds.

809
01:29:39,130 --> 01:29:42,760
Moisture!

810
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:46,800
Wind traps.
Huge ones.

811
01:29:56,920 --> 01:29:59,050
Water.

812
01:29:59,130 --> 01:30:01,970
Millions of decaliters.

813
01:30:02,050 --> 01:30:04,470
A treasure.

814
01:30:04,550 --> 01:30:07,260
Greater than treasure, Usul.

815
01:30:07,340 --> 01:30:10,840
We have thousands
of such caches,

816
01:30:12,260 --> 01:30:15,090
and only a few of us
know them all.

817
01:30:15,170 --> 01:30:18,090
And when we have enough,

818
01:30:18,170 --> 01:30:22,050
we shall change
the face of Arrakis.

819
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:44,800
Tell me of your home world, Usul.

820
01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:49,720
"Tell me of your home world, Usul. "

821
01:31:26,050 --> 01:31:29,760
Rabban! Rabban!

822
01:31:31,670 --> 01:31:35,880
We're knee-deep in Atreides blood.
We've gutted them!

823
01:31:35,970 --> 01:31:39,800
We've gutted them!

824
01:31:42,470 --> 01:31:44,970
Rabban. Rabban!

825
01:31:47,050 --> 01:31:49,510
I place you in charge of Arrakis.

826
01:31:49,550 --> 01:31:52,510
It's yours to squeeze
as I promised.

827
01:31:52,550 --> 01:31:56,840
I want you to squeeze
and squeeze and squeeze!

828
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:59,010
Give me spice!

829
01:31:59,050 --> 01:32:02,170
Drive them! Drive them
into utter submission!

830
01:32:02,220 --> 01:32:05,470
Do not show the slightest pity
or mercy!

831
01:32:05,550 --> 01:32:09,510
Never stop! Go! Go!
Show no mercy!

832
01:32:09,550 --> 01:32:11,970
Yes, Baron.

833
01:32:31,510 --> 01:32:33,420
Feyd.

834
01:32:43,510 --> 01:32:47,920
And when
we've crushed these people enough,

835
01:32:48,010 --> 01:32:52,340
I'll send you, Feyd.

836
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:58,550
Lovely Feyd.

837
01:33:04,510 --> 01:33:07,800
Where's my doctor?

838
01:33:14,380 --> 01:33:16,880
Jessica...

839
01:33:16,970 --> 01:33:20,340
our Reverend Mother is too old.

840
01:33:20,420 --> 01:33:23,510
She has been calling
through space and time...

841
01:33:23,590 --> 01:33:27,220
for you to come
and let her rest.

842
01:33:27,300 --> 01:33:32,920
She asks that you pass within
and become our Reverend Mother.

843
01:33:34,630 --> 01:33:38,590
If you be a Reverend Mother...

844
01:33:40,970 --> 01:33:44,920
let Shai-Halud judge now!

845
01:33:48,130 --> 01:33:50,050
The Water of Life.

846
01:33:53,010 --> 01:33:57,130
But what of my unborn child?

847
01:33:57,220 --> 01:34:00,720
One day, I will have to do this.

848
01:34:17,550 --> 01:34:20,470
Following the Bene Gesserit tradition,

849
01:34:20,510 --> 01:34:23,010
the old Reverend Mother
surrendered her life...

850
01:34:23,090 --> 01:34:26,130
as she surrendered her knowledge.

851
01:34:26,220 --> 01:34:31,470
Jessica had successfully transmuted
the poisonous Water of Life.

852
01:34:31,550 --> 01:34:36,050
Every man who has tried has died.

853
01:34:36,130 --> 01:34:38,130
Am I the one?

854
01:34:38,220 --> 01:34:42,510
The sleeper must awaken.

855
01:34:46,380 --> 01:34:48,470
The tremendous power
of the Water of Life...

856
01:34:48,550 --> 01:34:52,050
caused the premature birth
of Jessica's daughter, Alia.

857
01:34:52,130 --> 01:34:56,630
Alia was born with all the knowledge
and powers of a Reverend Mother.

858
01:35:11,630 --> 01:35:14,760
Feyd, even though he's aging,

859
01:35:14,840 --> 01:35:18,760
Thufir's one of the finest Mentats
in the universe.

860
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:23,220
And he's mine, Feyd, all mine.

861
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:29,220
- Try it now.
- I will.

862
01:35:29,260 --> 01:35:31,220
Come.

863
01:35:43,970 --> 01:35:46,260
Oh, Thufir!

864
01:35:46,340 --> 01:35:49,920
I see they've installed
your heart plug already.

865
01:35:50,010 --> 01:35:54,260
Don't be angry.
Everyone gets one here.

866
01:35:54,340 --> 01:35:57,590
But this is not
why we're here.

867
01:35:57,630 --> 01:36:00,760
We brought you
a little cat, Thufir.

868
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:03,760
You must care for it
if you wish to live.

869
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:09,840
A poison has been introduced
into your body, Thufir Hawat.

870
01:36:09,920 --> 01:36:13,670
By milking this,
this smooth little cat's body,

871
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:16,010
you receive your antidote.

872
01:36:16,090 --> 01:36:18,170
It must be done each day.

873
01:36:20,510 --> 01:36:23,510
All I can see...

874
01:36:23,590 --> 01:36:26,720
is an Atreides
that I want to kill.

875
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:30,720
Feyd! No, no!

876
01:36:30,760 --> 01:36:35,840
Thufir's a Harkonnen now.
Aren't you, Thufir?

877
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:40,130
My duke! How I've failed you.

878
01:36:58,760 --> 01:37:01,920
Chani, I love you.

879
01:37:02,010 --> 01:37:04,670
I've always loved you.

880
01:37:28,720 --> 01:37:32,130
The Holy Warriors.

881
01:37:32,220 --> 01:37:35,720
No one ever dreamed
there were so many.

882
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:40,880
I am Usul.
Paul Muad'Dib.

883
01:37:44,130 --> 01:37:47,300
Our shared enemy, the Harkonnens,

884
01:37:47,380 --> 01:37:50,800
are once again
in control of Arrakis.

885
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:55,130
Stilgar, your leader,
has asked me and my mother...

886
01:37:55,220 --> 01:37:59,630
to teach you the weirding way
to crush the Harkonnens.

887
01:37:59,720 --> 01:38:02,470
We must do more than this.

888
01:38:02,550 --> 01:38:06,510
We must totally destroy
all spice production on Arrakis.

889
01:38:08,220 --> 01:38:12,300
The Guild and the entire universe
depends on spice.

890
01:38:12,380 --> 01:38:16,340
He who can destroy a thing
controls a thing.

891
01:38:16,420 --> 01:38:20,510
I will take 100 of your warriors
and train them.

892
01:38:20,590 --> 01:38:24,630
This 100 will train
the thousands that remain.

893
01:38:24,670 --> 01:38:30,130
When the spice flow stops,
all eyes will turn to Arrakis.

894
01:38:30,220 --> 01:38:32,550
The baron
and the emperor himself...

895
01:38:32,630 --> 01:38:35,090
will be forced to deal with us.

896
01:38:37,590 --> 01:38:42,300
Arrakis will become
the center of the universe.

897
01:38:44,470 --> 01:38:46,470
Orato!

898
01:38:49,630 --> 01:38:54,130
This obelisk
is of your hardest stone.

899
01:38:54,220 --> 01:38:56,380
Kick it.

900
01:39:02,510 --> 01:39:04,630
Hit it.

901
01:39:08,720 --> 01:39:12,760
Yell at it.

902
01:39:15,880 --> 01:39:17,840
Break!

903
01:39:20,170 --> 01:39:23,010
Korba... cut it.

904
01:39:35,590 --> 01:39:37,920
Move back.

905
01:39:54,170 --> 01:39:58,670
Cha-a-a-a...

906
01:39:58,760 --> 01:40:00,470
a- aksa!

907
01:40:02,300 --> 01:40:05,420
Muad'Dib!

908
01:40:05,510 --> 01:40:10,170
This is part of the weirding way
that we will teach you.

909
01:40:12,300 --> 01:40:16,170
Some thoughts
have a certain sound,

910
01:40:16,260 --> 01:40:18,970
that being the equivalent
to a form.

911
01:40:19,050 --> 01:40:22,220
Through sound and motion...

912
01:40:22,300 --> 01:40:26,300
you will be able to paralyze nerves,
shatter bones,

913
01:40:26,380 --> 01:40:30,800
set fires, suffocate an enemy
or burst his organs.

914
01:40:30,840 --> 01:40:35,760
We will kill until no Harkonnen
breathes Arrakeen air.

915
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:38,260
Muad'Dib!

916
01:40:40,300 --> 01:40:43,800
Cha-a-a-a-aksa!

917
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:50,970
Stilgar!

918
01:40:52,720 --> 01:40:54,630
- Muad'Dib!
- Hmm?

919
01:40:54,720 --> 01:40:56,970
Muad'Dib. Muad'Dib. Muad'Dib.

920
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:05,090
My name is a killing word.

921
01:41:05,170 --> 01:41:07,550
They are ready to fight.

922
01:41:07,630 --> 01:41:11,300
Yet in order to lead them,
I must conquer the worm.

923
01:41:11,340 --> 01:41:14,010
Conquer Shai-Halud.

924
01:41:22,170 --> 01:41:25,470
Take the kiswa maker hook
of our sietch...

925
01:41:25,550 --> 01:41:28,510
and ride as a leader of men.

926
01:41:41,090 --> 01:41:46,720
Mmmmmm. Shai-Halud.

927
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:30,840
I must not fear.
Fear is the mind killer.

928
01:42:38,010 --> 01:42:41,800
Only the very strong ones
travel this deep.

929
01:42:41,880 --> 01:42:45,260
Usul has called a big one!

930
01:42:45,300 --> 01:42:48,260
Again, it is the legend.

931
01:44:24,470 --> 01:44:26,340
Look!

932
01:44:26,420 --> 01:44:28,840
Muad'Dib!

933
01:45:00,920 --> 01:45:04,670
Usul, these are 15
of our finest warriors...

934
01:45:04,760 --> 01:45:08,300
to serve you as your guard.

935
01:45:12,840 --> 01:45:15,090
The Fedaykin.

936
01:45:22,510 --> 01:45:24,260
Cha-aksa!

937
01:45:25,970 --> 01:45:28,170
Ooh!

938
01:45:28,260 --> 01:45:30,170
Now.

939
01:45:34,470 --> 01:45:37,090
Cha-a-aksa!

940
01:45:40,970 --> 01:45:43,420
Cha-aksa! Cha-aksa!

941
01:45:44,510 --> 01:45:47,590
Cha-aksa! Cha-aksa!

942
01:45:47,670 --> 01:45:50,090
Aaaah!

943
01:45:52,630 --> 01:45:54,630
Cha-aksa!

944
01:45:54,720 --> 01:45:59,260
When the spice flow stops,
all eyes will turn to Arrakis.

945
01:45:59,340 --> 01:46:03,800
The baron and the emperor himself
will be forced to deal with us.

946
01:46:07,300 --> 01:46:11,840
Muad'Dib. Muad'Dib.
Muad'Dib. Muad'Dib.

947
01:46:11,920 --> 01:46:15,760
What happened?
What happened to you and your men?

948
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:19,050
- Muad'Dib. Muad'Dib.
- What are you saying?

949
01:46:19,130 --> 01:46:21,550
- Muad'Dib. Muad'Dib. Muad'Dib.
- What?

950
01:46:23,630 --> 01:46:26,590
He's been repeating that name
ever since we found him.

951
01:46:26,670 --> 01:46:32,170
Who is this... Muad'Dib?

952
01:46:36,220 --> 01:46:37,880
Cha-aksa!

953
01:46:37,970 --> 01:46:41,550
In the two standard years that followed,

954
01:46:41,630 --> 01:46:45,720
Muad'Dib and the Fremen brought
spice production to a standstill.

955
01:46:45,800 --> 01:46:48,800
Fearing for his life,
Rabban did his best...

956
01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:52,550
to hide this fact
from his uncle, the baron.

957
01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:02,340
Paul's sister, Alia,
matured at a frightening rate.

958
01:47:02,420 --> 01:47:05,720
Her small body
harbored tremendous powers.

959
01:47:05,800 --> 01:47:09,090
Paul and Chani's love grew.

960
01:47:14,380 --> 01:47:16,670
We surprised
a band of smugglers.

961
01:47:16,760 --> 01:47:20,300
Too bad.
I thought they were Harkonnen.

962
01:47:20,380 --> 01:47:22,380
Cha-aksa!

963
01:47:28,260 --> 01:47:30,510
Cha-a-aksa!

964
01:47:30,590 --> 01:47:32,590
Gurney!

965
01:47:35,090 --> 01:47:38,840
You've no need of your weapons
with me, Gurney Halleck.

966
01:47:38,920 --> 01:47:42,510
Paul? Paul?

967
01:47:42,590 --> 01:47:44,670
Don't you trust
your own eyes?

968
01:47:44,760 --> 01:47:47,170
They said you were dead.

969
01:47:49,260 --> 01:47:52,170
They... they said...

970
01:47:55,800 --> 01:47:58,760
Gurney! Gurney man!

971
01:47:58,840 --> 01:48:02,130
- You young pup! You young pup!
- Gurney!

972
01:48:18,380 --> 01:48:21,420
Emperor Shaddam the Fourth,

973
01:48:21,470 --> 01:48:25,630
you have one last chance
to take matters into your own hands...

974
01:48:25,720 --> 01:48:28,880
and bring the situation
under control on Arrakis.

975
01:48:28,970 --> 01:48:31,760
- What do you mean one last...
- Silence! Do not speak!

976
01:48:31,840 --> 01:48:35,550
Listen! You do not have
more than this one chance.

977
01:48:35,630 --> 01:48:38,550
I represent the entire Guild
in this matter.

978
01:48:38,630 --> 01:48:42,130
Our navigators warn you that
spice production is in great danger.

979
01:48:42,170 --> 01:48:47,010
A new Fremen leader, Muad'Dib,
has stopped spice mining on Arrakis.

980
01:48:47,090 --> 01:48:51,010
Our navigators suggest
he is not of Arrakis.

981
01:48:51,090 --> 01:48:54,300
No one on the outside world
has been able to see him.

982
01:48:54,380 --> 01:48:56,340
We do not know who he is.

983
01:48:56,380 --> 01:48:58,880
The Harkonnens
cannot stop him.

984
01:48:58,970 --> 01:49:02,670
Remedy the situation,
restore spice production,

985
01:49:02,760 --> 01:49:05,840
or you'll live out your life
in a pain amplifier.

986
01:49:14,220 --> 01:49:18,510
The emperor will stop him.
He won't take the Water of Life.

987
01:49:18,550 --> 01:49:21,010
That's why they want me killed.

988
01:49:21,050 --> 01:49:23,630
They're afraid I'll take
the Water of Life.

989
01:49:23,720 --> 01:49:27,670
I want 50 legions of Sardaukar
on Arrakis at once!

990
01:49:27,760 --> 01:49:31,380
Fifty legions?
That's our entire reserves as well.

991
01:49:31,470 --> 01:49:34,760
This is genocide: the deliberate
and systematic destruction...

992
01:49:34,840 --> 01:49:37,880
of all life on Arrakis!

993
01:49:39,260 --> 01:49:42,470
The emperor is coming. Chani! Chani!

994
01:49:45,050 --> 01:49:49,300
You were calling my name.
It frightened me.

995
01:49:49,340 --> 01:49:52,010
Oh, Chani.

996
01:49:52,090 --> 01:49:54,670
All the images
of my future are gone.

997
01:49:57,300 --> 01:49:59,840
I have to drink
the Water of Life.

998
01:49:59,920 --> 01:50:02,670
No. Paul. Please.

999
01:50:02,760 --> 01:50:04,670
I've seen the men
who have tried.

1000
01:50:04,760 --> 01:50:06,720
I've seen how they died.

1001
01:50:06,800 --> 01:50:08,720
I'm dead to everyone
unless I try...

1002
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:11,170
to become what I may be.

1003
01:50:13,220 --> 01:50:15,880
Only the Water of Life
will free what can save us.

1004
01:50:16,970 --> 01:50:18,880
Paul.

1005
01:50:22,420 --> 01:50:25,510
I must drink the sacred water.

1006
01:50:27,880 --> 01:50:30,300
We must go now.

1007
01:51:24,260 --> 01:51:27,050
Hurry. All I see is darkness.

1008
01:51:27,130 --> 01:51:29,050
Paul,

1009
01:51:31,970 --> 01:51:33,880
I will love you forever.

1010
01:51:33,970 --> 01:51:37,510
You are my life.

1011
01:51:46,720 --> 01:51:48,630
You are my life.

1012
01:51:54,010 --> 01:51:57,300
Many men have tried.

1013
01:51:57,340 --> 01:51:59,300
They tried and failed?

1014
01:51:59,380 --> 01:52:01,340
They tried and died.

1015
01:52:09,880 --> 01:52:14,510
The worm is the spice.
The spice is the worm.

1016
01:52:34,050 --> 01:52:35,970
The worms.

1017
01:52:52,300 --> 01:52:55,010
They're not attacking. Why?

1018
01:53:13,880 --> 01:53:17,550
- Alia.
- Mother.

1019
01:53:19,970 --> 01:53:21,920
It's Paul.

1020
01:53:23,800 --> 01:53:28,260
He's taken the Water of Life.

1021
01:53:36,970 --> 01:53:39,130
There is a place...

1022
01:53:39,220 --> 01:53:43,590
terrifying to us, to women.

1023
01:53:43,630 --> 01:53:46,720
This is the place they cannot look.

1024
01:53:53,300 --> 01:53:56,380
Travelling without moving.

1025
01:53:57,760 --> 01:54:01,130
Now I truly control the worm...

1026
01:54:01,170 --> 01:54:04,470
and the spice.

1027
01:54:04,550 --> 01:54:09,670
And I have the power
to destroy the spice forever!

1028
01:54:38,220 --> 01:54:40,130
Paul.

1029
01:54:52,550 --> 01:54:54,510
Father!

1030
01:54:57,300 --> 01:55:02,220
Father, the sleeper has awakened!

1031
01:55:04,880 --> 01:55:16,260
Muad'Dib. Muad'Dib.

1032
01:55:16,340 --> 01:55:20,340
Muad'Dib. Muad'Dib.

1033
01:55:20,420 --> 01:55:23,130
Arrakis.

1034
01:55:23,220 --> 01:55:27,050
Dune. Desert planet.

1035
01:55:27,090 --> 01:55:31,170
Your time has come.

1036
01:55:31,260 --> 01:55:33,920
A storm is coming.

1037
01:55:34,010 --> 01:55:36,590
Our storm.

1038
01:55:36,670 --> 01:55:41,550
And when it arrives
it will shake the universe.

1039
01:55:43,220 --> 01:55:47,050
Emperor, we come for you!

1040
01:55:48,590 --> 01:55:50,630
We come for you!

1041
01:56:03,920 --> 01:56:07,670
Long live the fighters!

1042
01:56:07,760 --> 01:56:12,130
Long live the fighters!

1043
01:56:42,670 --> 01:56:47,760
Suspicion confirmed:
The emperor's had Rabban seized.

1044
01:57:29,220 --> 01:57:31,970
Gurney, when the storm hits,
set off the atomics.

1045
01:57:33,470 --> 01:57:37,840
I want an opening through
the entire shield wall.

1046
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:41,010
Stilgar, do we have wormsign?

1047
01:57:43,260 --> 01:57:48,130
Usul, we have wormsign the likes
of which even God has never seen.

1048
01:58:44,130 --> 01:58:46,880
Bring in that
floating fat man,

1049
01:58:46,970 --> 01:58:49,670
the baron.

1050
01:59:03,970 --> 01:59:05,970
Why have you brought me here?

1051
01:59:06,010 --> 01:59:08,630
Your Highness...

1052
01:59:08,720 --> 01:59:10,630
there must be some mistake.

1053
01:59:10,720 --> 01:59:13,510
- I never requested your presence.
- Ah.

1054
01:59:13,590 --> 01:59:16,220
But your lack of action
demanded it.

1055
01:59:16,300 --> 01:59:18,760
Your dreadful mismanagement,
your bad judgment...

1056
01:59:18,840 --> 01:59:22,340
in assigning to Rabban
the governorship.

1057
01:59:22,420 --> 01:59:26,010
You've forced me to come here
and set things straight, personally!

1058
01:59:35,510 --> 01:59:40,420
I am a messenger from Muad'Dib.

1059
01:59:40,470 --> 01:59:43,050
Poor Emperor!

1060
01:59:43,130 --> 01:59:46,300
I'm afraid my brother
won't be very pleased with you.

1061
01:59:46,380 --> 01:59:50,420
- Silence!
- Kill this child. She's an abomination.

1062
01:59:50,470 --> 01:59:52,920
Kill her!

1063
01:59:53,010 --> 01:59:55,630
Get out of my mind!

1064
01:59:55,670 --> 02:00:01,300
Not until you
tell them both who I really am.

1065
02:00:01,380 --> 02:00:04,340
Alia.

1066
02:00:06,670 --> 02:00:10,010
Daughter of
Duke Leto the Just...

1067
02:00:10,090 --> 02:00:13,840
and the Royal Lady Jessica.

1068
02:00:13,880 --> 02:00:19,630
Sister of Paul Muad'Dib.

1069
02:00:19,720 --> 02:00:23,630
Paul's sister?
Paul is Muad'Dib?

1070
02:00:28,260 --> 02:00:30,800
Alia keeps pace
with the storm.

1071
02:00:35,220 --> 02:00:38,590
With the storm,
their air power will be useless.

1072
02:00:38,670 --> 02:00:41,760
On Arrakis,
it's desert power.

1073
02:00:41,840 --> 02:00:45,050
Gurney,

1074
02:00:45,130 --> 02:00:46,130
now!

1075
02:00:46,220 --> 02:00:48,510
Atomics!

1076
02:01:22,840 --> 02:01:24,590
My brother is coming...

1077
02:01:24,670 --> 02:01:27,880
with many Fremen warriors.

1078
02:01:27,970 --> 02:01:30,670
Impossible!

1079
02:01:30,760 --> 02:01:32,670
Not impossible!

1080
02:01:32,760 --> 02:01:36,590
I told you.
He is here now.

1081
02:01:43,010 --> 02:01:46,050
Father, today I will avenge your death.

1082
02:02:10,050 --> 02:02:13,340
Emperor, an impassable storm
has descended.

1083
02:02:13,380 --> 02:02:16,470
The shield wall
has been penetrated by atomics.

1084
02:02:18,220 --> 02:02:20,170
Release the Sardaukar!

1085
02:02:20,220 --> 02:02:25,170
Baron, give this
little abomination to the storm.

1086
02:02:25,260 --> 02:02:27,970
Wait for my brother, Baron.

1087
02:03:13,590 --> 02:03:16,340
Cha-aksa!

1088
02:04:14,760 --> 02:04:16,920
Wait for my brother.

1089
02:04:23,050 --> 02:04:27,590
Cha-aksa!

1090
02:04:30,840 --> 02:04:32,840
Muad'Dib!

1091
02:04:43,170 --> 02:04:45,590
Cha-aksa!

1092
02:05:12,920 --> 02:05:14,840
Cha-aksa!

1093
02:05:17,090 --> 02:05:19,170
Cha-aksa!

1094
02:05:28,380 --> 02:05:29,670
Alia, now.

1095
02:05:29,720 --> 02:05:31,840
Come to me, Baron.

1096
02:06:45,130 --> 02:06:49,590
Muad'Dib.

1097
02:07:31,760 --> 02:07:34,170
Feyd Rautha.

1098
02:07:34,220 --> 02:07:37,470
Emperor Shaddam the Fourth,

1099
02:07:37,550 --> 02:07:39,720
there are Guild heighliners
above us...

1100
02:07:39,800 --> 02:07:41,920
containing many great
Houses of the Landsraad.

1101
02:07:42,010 --> 02:07:45,470
- Send them back!
- How dare you speak to me in that...

1102
02:07:45,550 --> 02:07:48,010
Stop your speaking!

1103
02:07:49,380 --> 02:07:52,380
You have some idea
of what I could do.

1104
02:07:54,510 --> 02:07:57,920
Don't try your powers on me.

1105
02:07:58,010 --> 02:08:01,010
Try looking into that place
where you dare not look.

1106
02:08:01,090 --> 02:08:03,050
You'll find me there
staring back at you.

1107
02:08:03,130 --> 02:08:05,260
- You mustn't speak...
- Silence!

1108
02:08:08,510 --> 02:08:12,090
I remember your gom jabbar.

1109
02:08:12,170 --> 02:08:15,720
Now you remember mine.
I can kill with a word.

1110
02:08:15,800 --> 02:08:17,880
Aaaah! Aaaah!

1111
02:08:17,970 --> 02:08:21,590
And his word
shall carry death eternal...

1112
02:08:21,670 --> 02:08:23,760
to those who stand
against the righteous.

1113
02:08:23,840 --> 02:08:27,260
- The righteous?
- There is a Harkonnen among you.

1114
02:08:29,260 --> 02:08:31,840
Give the Harkonnen a blade,

1115
02:08:31,920 --> 02:08:33,840
and let him stand forth.

1116
02:08:33,920 --> 02:08:37,550
If Feyd wishes, he can meet you
with my blade in his hand.

1117
02:08:37,630 --> 02:08:41,550
- I wish it.
- This is a Harkonnen animal.

1118
02:08:41,630 --> 02:08:44,220
Let me.
Please, my lord.

1119
02:08:44,300 --> 02:08:46,760
The Emperor's blade.

1120
02:09:16,840 --> 02:09:19,550
Why prolong the inevitable?

1121
02:09:21,970 --> 02:09:24,260
I will kill you!

1122
02:09:39,670 --> 02:09:41,970
I will kill him!

1123
02:09:48,090 --> 02:09:48,760
Paul!

1124
02:09:50,380 --> 02:09:52,720
I will kill him!

1125
02:10:01,670 --> 02:10:04,170
Who is the little one?

1126
02:10:04,220 --> 02:10:06,630
A pet, perhaps?

1127
02:10:06,720 --> 02:10:09,050
Will she deserve
my special attentions?

1128
02:10:16,920 --> 02:10:18,880
Poisoned.

1129
02:10:20,720 --> 02:10:24,170
You see your death.

1130
02:10:24,260 --> 02:10:27,010
My blade will finish you.

1131
02:10:28,800 --> 02:10:33,380
I will bend like a reed in the wind.

1132
02:10:33,470 --> 02:10:37,550
Aaaaah!

1133
02:10:47,470 --> 02:10:50,720
Cha-aksa!

1134
02:10:56,420 --> 02:10:58,010
Muad'Dib!

1135
02:10:58,050 --> 02:11:01,170
Usul no longer needs
the weirding module.

1136
02:11:01,220 --> 02:11:05,840
Muad'Dib had become the hand of God,

1137
02:11:05,920 --> 02:11:08,720
fulfilling the Fremen prophecy.

1138
02:11:08,800 --> 02:11:12,220
Where there was war,
Muad'Dib would now bring peace.

1139
02:11:12,300 --> 02:11:16,720
Where there was hatred,
Muad'Dib would bring love,

1140
02:11:16,760 --> 02:11:18,470
to lead the people
to true freedom,

1141
02:11:18,550 --> 02:11:22,420
and to change
the face of Arrakis.

1142
02:11:26,260 --> 02:11:28,170
We Fremen have a saying.

1143
02:11:28,220 --> 02:11:33,170
God created Arrakis
to train the faithful.

1144
02:11:33,260 --> 02:11:36,380
One cannot go against
the word of God.

1145
02:12:34,090 --> 02:12:36,880
And how can this be?

1146
02:12:38,470 --> 02:12:41,840
For he is the Kwisatz Haderach!
