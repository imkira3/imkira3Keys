No. No. I don't cry.

Sam Fuller. Transferred in
from Chicago last week...

157
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:43,344
...because of
anger-management problems.

Really? She seems like
such a people person. Um...

159
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,518
I've given this a lot of thought...

160
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:55,398
...and given that going out on ops
has become problematic in light of...

...the bank thing...
- Mmm.

Well, I have decided to become
the new face of the FBI.

I really wanna be there
and support the Bureau...

- Come again?

- You heard me.
- This is gonna be great.

- That was three days. This is your life.

That was teaching a dog
a few new tricks.

00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,616
This is teaching a dog

Okay, look. Look,
these are absolutely...

748
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:20,873
What are you...? What is she doing?
That hurts!

749
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:25,378
- Why did you run?
- Some crazy woman was chasing me!

750
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:30,132
Excuse me. Miss Parton, "Here You
Come Again" was my wedding song.

751
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:32,969
- I just love you.
- Honey, let's leave Miss Parton alone.

752
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:35,805
I love that song too.
That was an amazing song!

753
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:38,099
Why are you on top of me?

754
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:42,228
I'm just a big fan.

755
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:45,189
COLLINS:
It's also on CNN...

756
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:47,733
...MSNBC...

757
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:50,236
...and Al Jazeera.

758
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:54,490
- I was trying to question her regarding...
- You think you're something special.

759
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:57,493
I have got 75 people
working on this case day and night.

760
00:49:57,661 --> 00:50:00,579
- They don't stack up to you, do they?
- The limo driver...

761
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:03,833
I want you off this case.

762
00:50:04,209 --> 00:50:09,630
Well, I am sorry, sir, but you don't have
the authority to kick me off this case.

763
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:15,928
Mm-mm. I could call the director,
who happens to be a close, personal friend.

764
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:21,851
Or I could even call the president,
who invited me to dinner at his house.

765
00:50:22,227 --> 00:50:27,064
And I think we know which house
I'm talking about, don't we? It's white.

766
00:50:27,232 --> 00:50:28,774
Actually, it's like eggshell...

767
00:50:28,942 --> 00:50:33,446
I am the SAC in Las Vegas.
I have authority over my territory.

768
00:50:33,613 --> 00:50:36,323
And when the director sees you
on national television...

769
00:50:36,491 --> 00:50:40,494
...nose-tackling his favorite
country-western singer, he'll back me up.

770
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:44,290
Now, I want the two of you
on a jet back to New York today.

771
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:48,044
Do you think you can handle
that tiny, little task, Foreman?

772
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:49,503
Of course, sir.

773
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:57,970
Okay. I got you the last three seats
on the flight.

774
00:50:58,138 --> 00:51:00,556
Janine, Pam, you have to take
the next one. Sorry.

775
00:51:00,932 --> 00:51:03,851
- Because we're just hair and makeup?
- We could go to the bar.

776
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:06,437
For five hours?

777
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:08,022
Okay.

778
00:51:13,862 --> 00:51:16,363
GRACIE: The director's gonna
call me back any minute.

779
00:51:16,531 --> 00:51:17,865
Good. And when he does...

780
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:21,452
...you can let him know that chasing
Dolly was all your dumb idea.

781
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:24,830
Oh, really? Well, let me ask you
something, Chatty Cathy.

782
00:51:24,998 --> 00:51:28,584
What happened to, "Team, yo.
You and me in it together"?

783
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:32,129
Don't do that again. And that was
before you ruined my career.

784
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:33,589
- What?
- Yeah.

785
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:38,052
McDonald said that if I screwed this up,
then I'm out of the Bureau. Thanks.

786
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:40,596
What are you complaining about?
You're not famous.

787
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:43,224
Nobody knows who you are.
You're a private failure.

788
00:51:43,391 --> 00:51:46,936
But you see this? You see this?
Everybody knows this.

789
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:49,522
So if I screw up, I'm failure face.

790
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:52,483
Get your failure face
out of my ruined-career face...

791
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:55,945
...because right now I'm mad,
and I'm pissed off and mad, so...

792
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:58,280
Oh, okay, hold on.
So you're double mad?

793
00:51:58,448 --> 00:52:02,326
Well, if you're double mad, then I am
mad, mad, mad. All right? Top that one.

794
00:52:02,494 --> 00:52:04,370
- Back off!
- You gotta stop hitting me...

795
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:06,539
...because every time you do,
it wrinkles!

796
00:52:06,706 --> 00:52:08,666
JEFF:
Ladies, ladies!

797
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:13,546
Calm down. Sit down. Sit down.
I'm gonna separate the two of you.

798
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:16,257
Mad, mad, mad, mad. Four.

799
00:52:17,175 --> 00:52:18,717
I can still shoot her from here.

800
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:20,719
You have to lean over me to get to her.

801
00:52:20,887 --> 00:52:24,932
Now, let's calm down and try to focus
on the positive. We have our health.

802
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:28,602
- You'll be getting frequent-flyer miles.
- Foreman, what did you just say?

803
00:52:28,937 --> 00:52:31,147
Frequent-flyer miles.
It's a great way to get upgrades.

804
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:33,440
No, no, no, you said that she...

805
00:52:36,444 --> 00:52:41,073
You said that she would have
to lean over you to get to me.

806
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:47,580
Look at what the kidnappers are doing.

807
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:51,709
This guy is leaning over Cheryl
to get to Stan.

808
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:54,920
Why would they do that
if they were after Cheryl?

809
00:52:55,213 --> 00:52:58,757
Okay, and look at this. Look at this.
They're not even touching her.

810
00:52:58,925 --> 00:53:03,637
No, she's just stuck in there, like a
little Cheryl sandwich. She's... She's...

811
00:53:03,805 --> 00:53:08,225
Oh, my God. She is grabbing them.
I taught her that wristlock.

812
00:53:08,393 --> 00:53:13,022
- She's not defending herself. She's...
- She's defending Stan.

813
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:17,109
Maybe they weren't after Cheryl.
Maybe they were after Stan.

814
00:53:17,944 --> 00:53:19,904
Why? The man can't sing,
but is that a crime?

815
00:53:20,071 --> 00:53:22,990
- That's what we're gonna find out.
- Look, they're boarding.

816
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:25,201
- Let it go, Hart.
- Oh, Fuller, come on.

817
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:28,913
Wake up and smell the iced Venti
Caramel Macchiato. I'm onto something.

818
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:32,416
- Okay. Tell Collins.
- We have issues. He won't listen to me.

819
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:35,961
- And you think I am?
- Yes. Psst! Yes, I do.

820
00:53:36,129 --> 00:53:40,799
You don't get your miles unless
you're actually on the flight, so come on.

821
00:53:41,343 --> 00:53:43,677
- You're on your own, Hart.
GRACIE: No, I'm not.

822
00:53:43,845 --> 00:53:47,681
Because even though you refuse to
dress up or separate those eyebrows...

823
00:53:47,849 --> 00:53:49,934
...you cannot deny
that you have a style.

824
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:56,315
Gray suit, white shirt, masculine shoes.
You are an FBI agent.

825
00:53:56,483 --> 00:53:58,442
And that is all that you have.

826
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:04,031
And like you said, if you go back
there now, you are out of the Bureau.

827
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:08,452
WOMAN [ON PA]: Now boardjng
all rows on flight 624 to New York.

828
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,622
Fuller, I am begging you.

829
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:15,125
Do you have any idea
how painful this is for me?

830
00:54:15,293 --> 00:54:18,337
Usually, they give an epidural
for this kind of agony.

831
00:54:19,005 --> 00:54:24,009
Fuller, please, just... Just, please.

832
00:54:28,473 --> 00:54:30,683
Hart, you better be right, or I swear...

833
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:34,270
You're gonna kick my skinny white ass
and break my face. I know.

834
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:36,313
I already paid for the seats...

835
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:39,817
...and I don't get reimbursed
unless you're on the flight. Please.

836
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:49,076
JEFF: I'm letting you spend the night
because I wanna keep my eyes on you.

837
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:50,744
Tomorrow, you guys are on a flight.

838
00:54:50,912 --> 00:54:52,413
GRACIE:
As soon as we go to the home.

839
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:55,499
- What home? Whose home?
GRACIE: Where Stan Fields' mother lives.

840
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:57,918
She was the last to see him.
Maybe she knows something.

841
00:54:58,086 --> 00:55:00,212
JEFF: No way.
You're supposed to be in New York.

842
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:02,631
You're famous.
Everyone will recognize you.

843
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:06,302
Not to worry. Joel will come up
with something to make us blend.

844
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:09,555
- He's a born blender.
- I don't believe this.

845
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,891
You guys are lucky
Janet had to work late...

846
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:16,687
...because if she was here,
she would not put up with any of this.

847
00:55:17,355 --> 00:55:20,649
Now, Janet... Janet runs a tight ship.

848
00:55:23,236 --> 00:55:28,907
I love shopping in Vegas. Where else can
you find a 24-hour wiggery? To work.

849
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:33,412
Hey, hey! That's my room! Hey!

850
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:35,164
Hey!

851
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:46,550
- Wow. I never would have suspected.
- What?

852
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:49,762
You as a dainty-travel-pillow type.

853
00:55:49,929 --> 00:55:52,514
- It's hypoallergenic.
- Oh, really?

854
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:55,934
- And what are you allergic to?
- Besides you?

855
00:55:56,102 --> 00:56:01,190
Shellfish, cats, dogs,
any type of animal dander...

856
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:02,941
...dairy products, dust...

857
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:06,570
- You should be in a plastic bubble.
- Plastic.

858
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:10,699
- That explains it.
- Explains what?

859
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:13,744
- Why you're so angry.
- I'm not angry, I'm allergic.

860
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:16,288
All I was saying was that it just,
you know...

861
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:20,417
...couldn't have been easy
being a kid sick like that all the time.

862
00:56:21,002 --> 00:56:27,174
I mean, not being able to have a dog
or a cat or ice cream or dust.

863
00:56:28,593 --> 00:56:30,511
It wasn't bad.

864
00:56:30,678 --> 00:56:34,473
- Really?
- I got to hang out with my dad a lot.

865
00:56:35,183 --> 00:56:40,771
He was a sportswriter, so we got to
watch all the games on TV together...

866
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:43,273
...and he taught me how to box.

867
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:46,235
Taught me how to take care of myself.

868
00:56:50,156 --> 00:56:53,992
Well, I'm sure he was very proud of you.

869
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:57,287
Was?

870
00:56:58,873 --> 00:57:04,378
Uh... Yeah, I read on your file that
he died before you became an agent.

871
00:57:04,546 --> 00:57:08,465
- You read my file?
- I had to make sure you weren't crazy.

872
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:13,887
- Yeah. Turns out you can't trust a file.
- Yeah, well, I guess you can't.

873
00:57:14,055 --> 00:57:18,475
I thought I would've liked a tomboy
from Jersey whose mom was an agent.

874
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:21,645
- You read my file?
- Worse.

875
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:23,105
Your book.

876
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:26,608
Had to make sure you weren't crazy.

877
00:57:26,776 --> 00:57:30,195
Turns out you can't trust a book.

878
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:36,285
Yeah, they brought in this writer...

879
00:57:36,744 --> 00:57:40,831
...who managed to turn the entire story
into some fairy tale.

880
00:57:40,999 --> 00:57:43,876
In the first draft, he made it sound like
my mother died...

881
00:57:44,043 --> 00:57:48,422
...single-handedly saving the country,
when all it was was just, you know, a...

882
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:51,592
It was just a drug bust gone bad.

883
00:57:55,513 --> 00:57:56,805
Sorry.

884
00:57:58,558 --> 00:58:00,684
Sorry about your dad.

885
00:58:04,397 --> 00:58:07,357
But I'm mostly sorry
you had to read that book.

886
00:58:08,401 --> 00:58:10,819
I like the pictures, though.

887
00:58:11,404 --> 00:58:13,197
Oh, really?

888
00:58:13,364 --> 00:58:17,117
Yeah, especially that one with that guy.
What was his name?

889
00:58:17,702 --> 00:58:19,369
Which one?

890
00:58:19,537 --> 00:58:23,040
The agent, the one
that was in the pageant with you.

891
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:26,960
Eric Matthews.

892
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:30,005
Yeah. He was hot.

893

This is my lovely nurse, Rosie.

- Hello.
GRACIE: She's not very social...

901
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:14,800
...but she gives a superb enema
if you're feeling a little clogged up.

00:59:15,635 --> 00:59:17,761
Are you interested
in touring our facilities?

Yes, we are very interested.
I can't wait to get rid of her.

Don't listen to him. He's a mama's boy.
Come here, cutie. Let me fix your tie.

905

- He's such a mama's boy.

Not after you've heard it
for 30 years, Ida.

to come over here...

about the kidnapping.

he was here in Vegas, gambling.

your son, he loves the slot machines.

"One of these days, gambling's
gonna get you in a lot of trouble."

Yes, I did. "Sluts."

01:07:09,108 --> 01:07:12,152
...so I pursued the matter and found
he has a gambling problem.

1041
01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:15,280
You pursued the matter further?
Under whose authority?

1042
01:07:15,448 --> 01:07:18,533
- You've gotta lie, Foreman.
- Foreman, I am waiting.

1043
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:21,995
Tell him I'm dizzy from smashing
a suspect's head into the wall...

1044
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:24,205
...and I can't remember.
That always works.

1045
01:07:24,373 --> 01:07:26,166
- You know what I like to do? Faint.
- Shh!

1046
01:07:26,333 --> 01:07:29,127
We can't do this, guys. He's honest.

1047
01:07:29,295 --> 01:07:32,380
- Jeff, tell him the truth.
- The truth?

1048
01:07:32,548 --> 01:07:34,758
- Are you sure?
- Am I sure I want the truth?

1049
01:07:34,925 --> 01:07:37,218
Foreman, I want you to get a CAT scan.

1050
01:07:39,096 --> 01:07:41,890
I didn't get this information.
Agents Hart and Fuller did.

1051
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:45,226
- How? They're in New York.
JEFF: Well, at the airport...

1052
01:07:45,394 --> 01:07:47,562
COLLINS:
They're not in New York.

1053
01:07:57,823 --> 01:07:59,157
Hart?

1054
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:03,912
- Yes, sir.
- I assume that Agent Fuller is with you.

1055
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:06,247
- Yes, sir.
COLLINS: And Joel.

1056
01:08:06,415 --> 01:08:08,333
Hello, Walter.

1057
01:08:11,337 --> 01:08:15,006
I want all of you
in the situation room now.

1058
01:08:15,549 --> 01:08:17,884
COLLINS: That is what I want. That's right.
- Sir.

1059
01:08:19,053 --> 01:08:22,013
I want you to know that none of this
was Agent Foreman's idea.

1060
01:08:22,181 --> 01:08:25,100
Oh, I know, I know. Because
Foreman doesn't have any ideas.

1061
01:08:25,267 --> 01:08:27,268
This has you written all over it, Hart.

1062
01:08:27,436 --> 01:08:29,437
You've really gotta do things
your way, don't you?

1063
01:08:29,605 --> 01:08:33,650
Well, Dolce and Gabbana always said
we should express our personal style, sir.

1064
01:08:33,818 --> 01:08:36,528
- They were talking about a vest...
COLLINS: You're no super agent.

1065
01:08:36,695 --> 01:08:40,990
You're a loose cannon who lucked into
being in the right place at the right time.

1066
01:08:41,158 --> 01:08:43,451
You don't have to be that hard on her.
She was...

1067
01:08:43,619 --> 01:08:46,079
Oh, I am so glad you're with her
on this, Fuller...

1068
01:08:46,247 --> 01:08:49,124
...because you two are going down
together. The works.

1069
01:08:49,291 --> 01:08:52,961
- Review board, departmental hearings...
- Sir, we got another message e-mailed.

1070
01:08:53,504 --> 01:08:55,171
COLLINS:
Show me.

1071
01:08:55,756 --> 01:08:59,217
- Play it.
- This is Cheryl Frazier.

1072
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:01,553
Hi, again.

1073
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:06,558
The deadline has been changed.
It's not tomorrow, it's tonight.

1074
01:09:06,725 --> 01:09:09,727
The kidnappers are going to fax
instructions to the pageant...

1075
01:09:09,895 --> 01:09:11,729
...where the 5 million should be sent.

1076
01:09:11,897 --> 01:09:15,275
And if they don't receive it,
I'm going to be dead.

1077
01:09:16,402 --> 01:09:21,531
And I know it's a lot of money,
but it's my booty on the line.

1078
01:09:22,575 --> 01:09:24,742
- So...
- This is Stan Fields...

1079
01:09:24,910 --> 01:09:30,456
...and she's too young to die.
And I'm not as old as I look. So please.

1080
01:09:30,875 --> 01:09:32,208
JANET:
We also got this, sir.

1081
01:09:32,376 --> 01:09:36,421
A clerk at a print store saw a suspicious
man e-mail a message an hour ago.

1082
01:09:36,589 --> 01:09:40,592
Aerial spotted a pickup truck matching
the vehicle in the kidnapping video...

1083
01:09:40,759 --> 01:09:42,760
...heading south on 15.
COLLINS: You see this?

1084
01:09:42,928 --> 01:09:47,849
This is real information.
Not Dolly Parton and senior homes.

1085
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:49,726
That's how we do it in Vegas.

1086
01:09:51,145 --> 01:09:54,147
I want roadblocks on I-15 and
increased surveillance at the airports.

1087
01:09:54,315 --> 01:09:55,899
JANET: Got it.
COLLINS: Foreman?

1088
01:09:56,066 --> 01:09:57,108
Yes, sir.

1089
01:09:57,276 --> 01:10:01,070
I want you to put Hart, Fuller and Joel
on the first flight back to New York.

1090
01:10:01,238 --> 01:10:04,616
To make sure there's no problem,
Okun and Hills will be going with you.

1091
01:10:04,783 --> 01:10:07,535
If you get it wrong this time,
you are fired. Do you copy?

1092
01:10:07,703 --> 01:10:10,538
That won't be necessary,
because nobody is getting fired...

1093
01:10:10,706 --> 01:10:13,041
...and nobody is leaving.
COLLINS: Wrong again, Hart!

1094
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:17,086
And if I ever see you in my city again,
you can forget about the review board.

1095
01:10:17,254 --> 01:10:19,797
I will have you arrested
for obstruction of justice...

1096
01:10:19,965 --> 01:10:23,259
...and you can spend a very long time
in Las Vegas, in a jail cell.

1097
01:10:23,427 --> 01:10:24,636
You know what? You know what?

1098
01:10:24,803 --> 01:10:29,807
I have had just about enough of your
rudeness and insensitivity and cologne.

1099
01:10:29,975 --> 01:10:33,519
Oh, really? And what are you gonna do
about it? Call the director?

1100
01:10:33,687 --> 01:10:35,313
Go ahead. I got off the phone with him.

1101
01:10:35,481 --> 01:10:36,522
- Know what he said?
- What?

1102
01:10:36,690 --> 01:10:39,442
He said that you are the biggest mistake
he ever made.

1103
01:10:40,110 --> 01:10:42,070
And he said, and I quote...

1104
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:46,407
...that you "have become a liability
and an embarrassment to the Bureau."

1105
01:10:57,544 --> 01:10:59,337
Now, get going.

1106
01:11:29,827 --> 01:11:31,995
[CELL PHONE RINGING]

1107
01:11:32,204 --> 01:11:33,705
Okun.

1108
01:11:33,872 --> 01:11:37,792
It's Collins.
Yes, sir, we're at the airport.

1109
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:40,253
- Is he mad at me?
- Sorry, sir, I'm losing you.

1110
01:11:40,921 --> 01:11:43,840
JEFF: Does he wanna talk to me?
- Foreman! Leave him alone!

1111
01:11:44,633 --> 01:11:47,885
WOMAN [ON PA]:
Now boarding, flight 624 to New York.

1112
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:57,729
Yeah. I was looking at your ad...

1113
01:11:57,896 --> 01:12:01,816
...and I was wondering if you have
a Dolly Parton performer.

1114
01:12:02,609 --> 01:12:04,110
No?

1115
01:12:04,987 --> 01:12:07,238
Oh. Okay.

1116
01:12:11,827 --> 01:12:15,538
Hart, maybe you were right about Dolly.
Maybe you just had the wrong Dolly.

1117
01:12:15,706 --> 01:12:18,082
- You don't know if they have a Dolly.
- They don't.

1118
01:12:18,250 --> 01:12:21,085
I called there, and they said
the only place in Vegas...

1119
01:12:21,253 --> 01:12:24,297
...that has a Dolly Parton performer
is the Oasis Drag Club.

1120
01:12:24,465 --> 01:12:26,799
Just get on the plane, Fuller.

1121
01:12:29,762 --> 01:12:33,181
- Do you wanna save Cheryl or not?
- I'm gonna get her killed.

1122
01:12:33,349 --> 01:12:36,809
What's up with you? What happened
to that girl from the pageant?

1123
01:12:36,977 --> 01:12:38,770
She's gone.

1124
01:12:38,937 --> 01:12:42,815
Her boyfriend, Eric Matthews, broke up
with her. It was absolutely devastating.

1125
01:12:42,983 --> 01:12:44,776
SAM:
Is that what happened to you?

1126
01:12:45,069 --> 01:12:48,696
Oh, that's pathetic. Come on.

1127
01:12:48,864 --> 01:12:52,617
Plenty of guys have broken up with me.
You just beat them up and move on.

1128
01:12:52,785 --> 01:12:55,870
Only you and Foreman
turn it into some big soap opera.

1129
01:12:56,038 --> 01:13:00,917
Of course you don't understand how
Jeff feels, because he's not a cyborg.

1130
01:13:02,711 --> 01:13:06,589
He knows what it feels like
to be rejected and humiliated.

1131
01:13:09,968 --> 01:13:11,552
To feel your heart ripped open...

1132
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:15,473
...because you finally took a chance
on that relationship...

1133
01:13:16,266 --> 01:13:18,684
...and it wound up confirming
your worst fears...

1134
01:13:18,852 --> 01:13:22,980
...that you are worthless
and not worth caring about.

1135
01:13:27,694 --> 01:13:33,491
So you may not understand,
but that is how Jeff feels.

1136
01:13:41,834 --> 01:13:44,085
Matthews was right to dump you.

1137
01:13:46,964 --> 01:13:52,009
- Take that back.
- I would say, "Make me," but you can't.

1138
01:13:55,848 --> 01:13:57,515
Okay.

1139
01:13:57,766 --> 01:13:59,809
All right. Well...

1140
01:14:00,227 --> 01:14:02,895
...then I just have two things to say.

1141
01:14:03,105 --> 01:14:06,232
- What?
- First of all, we are in a public place...

1142
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:11,028
...so we have to display a sense
of decorum, and second of all...

1143
01:14:11,321 --> 01:14:12,738
...I might break a nail.

1144
01:14:12,948 --> 01:14:17,243
- Oh!
- Take it back! Take it back. Ow! Ow!

1145
01:14:17,411 --> 01:14:20,997
Jeez! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

1146
01:14:21,957 --> 01:14:24,959
All the stuff that Collins said
back there was a bunch of bull.

1147
01:14:25,127 --> 01:14:27,128
You figured out the limo driver was dirty.

1148
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:29,672
You figured out that
they were after Stan.

1149
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:32,091
You're not lucky. You're good.

1150
01:14:36,430 --> 01:14:39,515
Thank you. But take it back,
take it back, take it back.

1151
01:14:39,683 --> 01:14:41,809
Okay, I'll take it back
if you admit one thing.

1152
01:14:41,977 --> 01:14:43,019
What?

1153
01:14:43,770 --> 01:14:45,855
Oh, God!

1154
01:14:47,316 --> 01:14:51,861
For the first time in a long time,
you feel like the real Gracie Hart.

1155
01:14:56,658 --> 01:15:00,536
Oh, my God.

1156
01:15:00,704 --> 01:15:04,040
Straining muscles
cutting off someone's air supply.

1157
01:15:04,208 --> 01:15:05,583
Sweating like a pig.

1158
01:15:08,295 --> 01:15:11,088
You're right, I feel like a woman again.

1159
01:15:11,548 --> 01:15:13,591
Good. I take it back. Now release.

1160
01:15:14,092 --> 01:15:15,510
You first.

1161
01:15:15,677 --> 01:15:16,969
- On three.
- One.

1162
01:15:17,137 --> 01:15:19,597
SAM:
Two. Three.

1163
01:15:21,391 --> 01:15:24,185
Oh, no.

1164
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:27,146
Okay, just to show you I trust you.

1165
01:15:31,902 --> 01:15:36,531
Now boarding all passengers
for flight 624 to New York.

1166
01:15:37,282 --> 01:15:38,783
Thanks.

1167
01:15:39,201 --> 01:15:40,952
All right.

1168
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:44,914
Okay, kids, time for the circus
to leave town.

1169
01:15:45,666 --> 01:15:47,625
Come on, girls.

1170
01:15:47,876 --> 01:15:49,961
How are we gonna
get rid of these guys?

1171
01:15:50,128 --> 01:15:52,129
I don't know. But it has to be subtle.

1172
01:15:52,297 --> 01:15:53,714
Keep it moving.

1173
01:15:54,341 --> 01:15:56,133
Oh!

1174
01:15:57,094 --> 01:15:58,970
God!

1175
01:15:59,346 --> 01:16:00,888
Ooh, Lordy!

1176
01:16:01,056 --> 01:16:02,723
Ladies' time.

1177
01:16:02,891 --> 01:16:05,434
I have the cramps. I have to...
I have to go to the bathroom.

1178
01:16:05,602 --> 01:16:07,645
Hart. There's one on the plane.

1179
01:16:07,813 --> 01:16:11,816
I know, but, guys, PMS for me means
"pants might shred," so I gotta...

1180
01:16:11,984 --> 01:16:15,820
- Forget it, Hart.
- Guys, you don't understand. I bloat.

1181
01:16:15,988 --> 01:16:20,741
I take on water, and I expand, and I may
change the cabin pressure of that plane.

1182
01:16:20,909 --> 01:16:22,910
I gotta take her to the bathroom.

1183
01:16:24,329 --> 01:16:27,748
GRACIE: I need a tampon!
- You heard her, we got a agent down.

1184
01:16:27,916 --> 01:16:30,376
We need tampons!

1185
01:16:31,253 --> 01:16:33,671
- I'm not getting those.
- I don't even do it for my wife.

1186
01:16:33,839 --> 01:16:36,257
This is a job for a real man.
