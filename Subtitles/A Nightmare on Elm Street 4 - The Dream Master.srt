2
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:38,517
Hello.

3
00:02:38,561 --> 00:02:39,961
Do you live here?

4
00:02:40,997 --> 00:02:42,590
Nobody lives here.

5
00:02:46,138 --> 00:02:47,299
Where's Freddy?

6
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:49,471
He's not home.

7
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:37,877
One, two

8
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:40,750
Freddy's coming for you

9
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:42,346
Three, four

10
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:45,121
Better lock your door

11
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,287
Five, six

12
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:48,798
Grab your crucifix

13
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,534
Be calm, Kristen.

14
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,719
Joey!

15
00:05:33,755 --> 00:05:35,314
Kincaid!

16
00:05:35,358 --> 00:05:37,520
Help me!

17
00:05:51,783 --> 00:05:54,948
Aw, shit, Kristen, not again.

18
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:56,479
I'm sorry, Kincaid.

19
00:05:56,524 --> 00:05:57,821
Sorry?

20
00:05:57,859 --> 00:05:59,919
You are one spooked chick.

21
00:06:06,505 --> 00:06:08,599
Thank God.

22
00:06:08,641 --> 00:06:10,610
- I thought for a minute...
- What?

23
00:06:10,644 --> 00:06:11,873
Dragging us in here?

24
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,141
Yeah. Cut it out.

25
00:06:13,181 --> 00:06:16,118
You're putting one serious dent
in my beauty sleep.

26
00:06:16,153 --> 00:06:19,488
It's Freddy. He's here.
I heard him.

27
00:06:19,525 --> 00:06:22,256
Freddy is dead...
buried and consecrated.

28
00:06:22,295 --> 00:06:23,991
We won, remember?

29
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:25,498
He's coming back for us.

30
00:06:25,533 --> 00:06:27,729
Kincaid's right.

31
00:06:27,769 --> 00:06:29,260
Fred Krueger's history.

32
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:30,739
Come here.

33
00:06:33,044 --> 00:06:34,876
The pipes are cold.

34
00:06:34,914 --> 00:06:36,883
The boiler is cold.

35
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:38,282
See for yourself.

36
00:06:48,267 --> 00:06:49,565
I don't know.

37
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:06,748
How are you, Mr. Johnson?

38
00:08:08,987 --> 00:08:10,717
That's nice.

39
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:14,351
Hi, Kristen.
Rick will be out any second.

40
00:08:15,264 --> 00:08:16,390
You going out dressed like that?

41
00:08:16,432 --> 00:08:18,401
What's wrong with me this time?

42
00:08:19,605 --> 00:08:21,437
I'll just wait by the car.

43
00:08:21,473 --> 00:08:22,634
Me, too.

44
00:08:28,584 --> 00:08:30,052
Something wrong with the stairs?

45
00:08:30,087 --> 00:08:31,714
It's avoid all contact day.

46
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,550
What?

47
00:08:37,062 --> 00:08:39,555
When Dad's popping aspirin
like popcorn...

48
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,432
it's avoid all contact day.

49
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:46,707
Waiting for a limo?

50
00:08:49,248 --> 00:08:50,408
I'm off to the club, honey!

51
00:08:55,424 --> 00:08:56,858
Let's go.

52
00:09:05,138 --> 00:09:07,540
All right,
anybody have trig this semester?

53
00:09:07,575 --> 00:09:09,042
What happened?

54
00:09:09,078 --> 00:09:11,138
I had a conflict...
homework or "Dynasty"...

55
00:09:11,182 --> 00:09:12,877
and "Dynasty" won.

56
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:14,977
Sad story.
Soaps will kill you.

57
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:19,692
Mmm. There's Dan Jordan.

58
00:09:21,263 --> 00:09:25,099
We are talking
one major-league hunk.

59
00:09:30,876 --> 00:09:34,473
You know,
you are one major-league hunk.

60
00:09:36,052 --> 00:09:37,384
Thanks, Alice.

61
00:09:38,189 --> 00:09:39,350
Earth to Alice.

62
00:09:41,193 --> 00:09:43,128
Hey, you spacing again?

63
00:09:43,162 --> 00:09:44,424
Rick, please.

64
00:09:44,464 --> 00:09:46,433
Well, tell you what,
he's a friend of mine.

65
00:09:46,467 --> 00:09:47,628
I'll introduce you.

66
00:09:49,071 --> 00:09:51,563
Just kidding.
But I would introduce her.

67
00:09:51,607 --> 00:09:54,772
All right.
I think I see salvation.

68
00:10:05,328 --> 00:10:06,626
How can you ride
this health hazard?

69
00:10:06,663 --> 00:10:08,825
It's no wonder
that you have asthma.

70
00:10:09,468 --> 00:10:12,063
No, you see, asthma is
an inherited condition.

71
00:10:12,105 --> 00:10:13,903
Read a book now and then,
you might know something.

72
00:10:14,977 --> 00:10:17,310
Speaking of books,
isn't trig your favorite?

73
00:10:18,848 --> 00:10:20,315
"Dynasty" again?

74
00:10:21,652 --> 00:10:24,282
Deb, do us a favor
and get a VCR.

75
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,493
Hey, baby...

76
00:10:27,529 --> 00:10:29,794
you're sucking
on the wrong nozzle.

77
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:31,164
Hey, yo, needle dick!

78
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,566
I bet you're the only male
in this school...

79
00:10:32,602 --> 00:10:34,662
suffering from penis envy.

80
00:10:38,178 --> 00:10:39,339
I owe you one.

81
00:10:44,052 --> 00:10:46,112
- So disgusting.
- Hey, Supergirl, it's dead.

82
00:10:46,155 --> 00:10:47,384
Give a bug a break.

83
00:11:05,051 --> 00:11:06,883
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, guys?

84
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,686
That's all you have to say
after last night?

85
00:11:09,724 --> 00:11:12,455
You better be careful.
He's coming back.

86
00:11:12,494 --> 00:11:13,792
Listen, little sister...

87
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:16,299
you got this freako talent to
bring folks into your dream...

88
00:11:16,335 --> 00:11:18,395
but we don't need it anymore.

89
00:11:18,438 --> 00:11:20,100
Time to start living
like regular people.

90
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:22,006
Yeah. Let it rest.

91
00:11:22,042 --> 00:11:23,908
Did it ever occur to you
if you keep going in...

92
00:11:23,945 --> 00:11:25,675
you might stir him up again?

93
00:11:25,715 --> 00:11:27,650
Look, we'll help you.

94
00:11:27,684 --> 00:11:29,676
We all have better things
to dream about.

95
00:11:29,721 --> 00:11:32,749
You got that right...
signed and sealed.

96
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:34,693
Then what about this?

97
00:11:34,729 --> 00:11:37,291
That don't mean dick.
My dog is like me...

98
00:11:37,332 --> 00:11:39,801
drag him into your crazy dream,
and he gets wild.

99
00:11:40,804 --> 00:11:42,204
Here comes your boyfriend.

100
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,708
Can he give you
a good night's sleep?

101
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:45,177
We don't kiss and tell.
How about you guys?

102
00:11:48,448 --> 00:11:49,939
Look, we'll talk later,
all right?

103
00:11:53,256 --> 00:11:56,227
Those guys are kinda spooky.

104
00:11:56,261 --> 00:11:59,561
Oh... then you must think
I'm a total freak.

105
00:11:59,599 --> 00:12:00,897
I go back and forth.

106
00:12:01,769 --> 00:12:04,261
Hey, lighten up. No one died.

107
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:17,476
Hi, Dad.

108
00:13:23,925 --> 00:13:25,257
Looking for something?

109
00:13:26,396 --> 00:13:27,556
Shithead.

110
00:13:36,944 --> 00:13:38,913
I'm late. I know.

111
00:13:39,749 --> 00:13:41,274
Damn contracts.

112
00:13:42,586 --> 00:13:43,747
Let's eat.

113
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,459
We waited a long time.

114
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:49,053
And we gave up, as usual.

115
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:56,771
You call this vegetation a meal
after a ten-hour workday?

116
00:13:56,808 --> 00:13:59,711
What the hell am I, a rabbit?

117
00:13:59,745 --> 00:14:02,476
Christ, Alice,
try to think a little more.

118
00:14:06,489 --> 00:14:07,889
Yeah, I can think.

119
00:14:07,924 --> 00:14:10,655
I can think of how sick I am...

120
00:14:10,694 --> 00:14:12,458
of watching you
drink your life away...

121
00:14:12,498 --> 00:14:15,025
and taking it out on me.

122
00:14:17,939 --> 00:14:20,705
I'm talking to you.
Are you awake or what?

123
00:14:20,744 --> 00:14:22,337
Dad, don't start.

124
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,506
Start what?

125
00:14:23,547 --> 00:14:26,074
Telling the little daydreamer
to wake up?

126
00:14:26,118 --> 00:14:28,087
It's long overdue.

127
00:14:29,022 --> 00:14:30,820
I don't need this aggravation.

128
00:15:10,418 --> 00:15:12,581
Jason.
Come on, boy, come on.

129
00:15:13,456 --> 00:15:15,425
Come on. That's a boy.

130
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:17,450
You almost scared me, boy.

131
00:15:38,326 --> 00:15:40,660
You ugly sucker!

132
00:15:40,697 --> 00:15:41,925
Damn!

133
00:15:49,609 --> 00:15:51,009
This ain't my dreamland.

134
00:15:55,585 --> 00:15:57,646
If you're here,
I'm gonna pound your ass!

135
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,742
Fuckin' "A."

136
00:18:23,439 --> 00:18:25,739
You shouldn't have buried me.

137
00:18:25,777 --> 00:18:27,746
I'm not dead.

138
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,111
Take that, motherfucker!

139
00:19:52,139 --> 00:19:55,770
Kristen, Freddy's back!

140
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:10,228
I'll see you in hell.

141
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:13,395
Tell 'em Freddy sent ya.

142
00:20:18,745 --> 00:20:20,805
One down...

143
00:20:20,848 --> 00:20:22,282
two to go.

144
00:22:25,168 --> 00:22:26,328
Wait.

145
00:22:32,411 --> 00:22:34,643
How's this for a wet dream?

146
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:42,793
Kristen! Help!

147
00:22:52,341 --> 00:22:53,502
Show it!

148
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:09,928
Hi, guys.

149
00:23:41,983 --> 00:23:43,712
Sorta defeats the purpose,
don't it?

150
00:23:43,751 --> 00:23:46,153
- What?
- The mirror.

151
00:23:46,189 --> 00:23:47,589
You can't see yourself in it.

152
00:23:48,592 --> 00:23:50,026
I don't want to.

153
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:54,859
You know,
if Mom was still alive...

154
00:23:54,901 --> 00:23:56,962
Dad wouldn't treat us like this.

155
00:23:57,806 --> 00:24:01,209
Alice, you gotta learn
to stand up for yourself.

156
00:24:01,946 --> 00:24:03,278
You know, fight back.

157
00:24:05,818 --> 00:24:07,218
Like that.
It's all in the mind.

158
00:24:07,253 --> 00:24:08,516
You see yourself
doing something...

159
00:24:08,555 --> 00:24:10,023
and your body reacts
and does it.

160
00:24:10,058 --> 00:24:11,218
Like so.

161
00:24:12,762 --> 00:24:13,889
Like that. Now you do it.

162
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:15,454
Me? No, I can't.

163
00:24:15,499 --> 00:24:17,491
- Yeah, you can.
- No, I can't.

164
00:24:17,536 --> 00:24:20,995
Yes, you can.
Just get up there and just...

165
00:24:21,942 --> 00:24:23,570
Like that.
Big and strong. Do it.

166
00:24:26,984 --> 00:24:29,215
Good, but, Alice-san...

167
00:24:29,254 --> 00:24:31,655
you must have balance.

168
00:24:33,092 --> 00:24:34,252
So go to it.

169
00:24:42,039 --> 00:24:44,372
Swish. Killed a fish.

170
00:24:52,054 --> 00:24:55,822
Joey, I'm getting tired
of picking up your clothes.

171
00:24:56,594 --> 00:24:57,721
And this crap...

172
00:24:57,763 --> 00:24:59,857
I wish you'd turn it off.

173
00:25:28,341 --> 00:25:30,242
Here you are.

174
00:25:30,277 --> 00:25:32,941
Where were you this morning?
Rick's looking all over.

175
00:25:32,982 --> 00:25:35,850
Have you seen Joey and Kincaid?
I can't find them.

176
00:25:35,887 --> 00:25:37,355
I'm sure they're around.

177
00:25:37,389 --> 00:25:39,187
Well, I'm not so sure.

178
00:25:42,963 --> 00:25:44,591
We have matching luggage again.

179
00:25:45,801 --> 00:25:48,134
The bags under your eyes.

180
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:49,936
Nightmares?

181
00:25:49,974 --> 00:25:51,567
God, I hate dreaming.

182
00:25:52,343 --> 00:25:54,039
I love to dream.

183
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:56,548
I just hate the ones
about my dad.

184
00:25:56,583 --> 00:25:58,552
How do you handle
your nightmares?

185
00:25:58,586 --> 00:26:00,920
My mom taught me
when I was little.

186
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:04,495
Did you ever hear
of the dream master?

187
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:06,623
Sounds like
a game show host to me.

188
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:08,259
No, it's a rhyme.

189
00:26:08,302 --> 00:26:11,466
Just have to dream
about someplace fun.

190
00:26:11,506 --> 00:26:13,031
Remember, you're in control.

191
00:26:15,345 --> 00:26:17,611
How do you know so much
about dreams?

192
00:26:18,816 --> 00:26:21,912
When it's all you have,
you kinda become an expert.

193
00:26:24,893 --> 00:26:26,019
We better get going...

194
00:26:26,062 --> 00:26:27,928
before your brother
starts a search party.

195
00:26:30,067 --> 00:26:33,903
Anyway, Kafka and Goethe
have never been irreconcilable.

196
00:26:35,242 --> 00:26:36,767
Kris, where were you?

197
00:26:42,752 --> 00:26:45,278
- Hey, what...
- He killed them!

198
00:26:45,322 --> 00:26:47,188
What? Wait! Calm down!

199
00:26:50,932 --> 00:26:52,423
Hey, somebody help her.

200
00:27:05,854 --> 00:27:07,755
Feeling better now?

201
00:27:08,292 --> 00:27:09,623
Yeah, I guess so.

202
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:14,998
What happened?

203
00:27:15,802 --> 00:27:17,167
You had quite a nasty bump.

204
00:27:18,273 --> 00:27:19,673
I gotta get out of here!

205
00:27:19,709 --> 00:27:20,937
Now, now, now.

206
00:27:20,977 --> 00:27:22,536
You stay put.

207
00:27:22,578 --> 00:27:24,342
You need to rest.

208
00:27:24,381 --> 00:27:26,282
You don't get it.

209
00:27:26,318 --> 00:27:27,877
He's after me.

210
00:27:30,658 --> 00:27:32,148
It's OK, honey.

211
00:27:41,809 --> 00:27:43,869
I wanna draw some blood.

212
00:27:51,689 --> 00:27:52,952
Feeling better now?

213
00:27:53,959 --> 00:27:55,120
What happened?

214
00:27:55,829 --> 00:27:57,627
You had quite a nasty bump.

215
00:28:27,108 --> 00:28:28,268
You seen Rick around?

216
00:28:32,183 --> 00:28:33,617
You are his sister, right?

217
00:28:35,021 --> 00:28:37,149
Rick stayed late after school.

218
00:28:37,191 --> 00:28:38,955
Kristen wasn't feeling
very well.

219
00:28:38,994 --> 00:28:40,519
Could you tell him
I'm looking for him?

220
00:28:41,864 --> 00:28:44,095
Oh, by the way, I'm Dan.

221
00:28:49,876 --> 00:28:51,071
Sorry, Alice.

222
00:28:51,112 --> 00:28:53,104
Your shift's over. My table now.

223
00:28:56,719 --> 00:28:58,620
Hi, guys. Hi, Dan.
How are you doing?

224
00:28:58,657 --> 00:29:02,094
Hi. Can I get just a Coke
and some fries?

225
00:29:02,128 --> 00:29:05,224
Do you wanna hear our specials,
or do you want any dessert?

226
00:29:05,265 --> 00:29:07,734
Oh, hi, handsome.
Care for some buns?

227
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:11,098
- Here.
- You in a hurry?

228
00:29:11,141 --> 00:29:13,133
Gotta get to the library
before it closes.

229
00:29:13,177 --> 00:29:14,440
Killer physics test.

230
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,041
I know. I hardly have
any time to study.

231
00:29:17,083 --> 00:29:19,576
Maybe you shouldn't be
working here so much.

232
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:22,249
You don't want to wait tables
the rest of your life.

233
00:29:22,291 --> 00:29:24,955
I know.
It's my greatest fear.

234
00:29:24,996 --> 00:29:28,434
You know, he is so cute.

235
00:29:28,468 --> 00:29:30,596
- I wonder where he works out?
- Save it, Deb.

236
00:29:30,638 --> 00:29:33,233
I mean, there is life
after exercise.

237
00:29:33,274 --> 00:29:34,401
One of these days...

238
00:29:34,443 --> 00:29:36,742
I'm gonna set you up
with a real guy...

239
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:38,771
teach you to get
your priorities straight.

240
00:29:38,816 --> 00:29:40,182
I think Sheila's
more interested...

241
00:29:40,218 --> 00:29:42,346
in dissecting bodies
than their outsides.

242
00:29:42,388 --> 00:29:45,791
Give her time. Her hormones
will kick in some day.

243
00:29:45,826 --> 00:29:49,787
Deb, later in life,
you'll appreciate my motto.

244
00:29:49,833 --> 00:29:53,601
- What's that?
- Mind over matter.

245
00:29:54,974 --> 00:29:56,134
I'll see you later, OK?

246
00:30:03,019 --> 00:30:04,612
Alice, can you leave here?

247
00:30:04,655 --> 00:30:05,884
What's wrong?

248
00:30:05,924 --> 00:30:07,756
Kincaid and Joey
died last night.

249
00:30:07,793 --> 00:30:09,351
What?

250
00:30:09,395 --> 00:30:11,797
Hey, Rick, come here!

251
00:30:11,831 --> 00:30:12,991
Stay with her.

252
00:30:14,002 --> 00:30:15,903
Kristen, what happened?

253
00:30:16,906 --> 00:30:19,103
Look, you're gonna hear
all kinds of stories.

254
00:30:20,345 --> 00:30:22,610
And after all
we've been through together...

255
00:30:23,282 --> 00:30:25,376
how could I let him get to them?

256
00:30:25,419 --> 00:30:27,149
We were a team.

257
00:30:27,855 --> 00:30:30,017
I'm gonna get
that son of a bitch.

258
00:30:30,059 --> 00:30:31,220
Who?

259
00:30:32,296 --> 00:30:33,992
Rick, we gotta go.

260
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:36,333
- Now.
- I'm coming.

261
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:38,830
Before it's too late.

262
00:30:38,872 --> 00:30:40,932
I gotta go.
I guess I'll talk to you later.

263
00:30:56,666 --> 00:30:58,396
So, why the haunted house?

264
00:30:59,503 --> 00:31:01,631
It's not just a house.

265
00:31:01,673 --> 00:31:03,973
It's his home.

266
00:31:04,011 --> 00:31:06,310
He's waiting in there
for me to dream.

267
00:31:06,347 --> 00:31:07,815
Hey, it's OK. We're with you.

268
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:10,582
I told you, you can't help me.

269
00:31:11,455 --> 00:31:13,184
This isn't a normal nightmare.

270
00:31:14,259 --> 00:31:15,557
I'm history.

271
00:31:16,662 --> 00:31:18,255
I don't get it.

272
00:31:20,334 --> 00:31:21,859
- Come on.
- Jeez. What'd I miss?

273
00:31:22,705 --> 00:31:24,537
She told us a story
about Freddy.

274
00:31:24,574 --> 00:31:27,271
Fred Krueger.
He's a town legend.

275
00:31:27,311 --> 00:31:29,803
He was a child killer
freed on a technicality.

276
00:31:30,817 --> 00:31:31,943
So?

277
00:31:31,986 --> 00:31:34,251
So, a lot of parents
got pissed off...

278
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:37,421
and, according to Kris...

279
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,088
they hunted him down
and roasted him...

280
00:31:39,129 --> 00:31:40,825
like a Thanksgiving turkey.

281
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,960
Nice neighborhood.

282
00:31:44,036 --> 00:31:45,766
Anyway,
that's where it gets weird.

283
00:31:45,806 --> 00:31:48,708
She says that he comes back
in dreams.

284
00:31:48,743 --> 00:31:50,439
And if he kills you
in your dream...

285
00:31:51,481 --> 00:31:52,881
you're dead for real.

286
00:31:56,723 --> 00:31:58,817
Now I lay me down to sleep.

287
00:31:58,859 --> 00:32:01,852
The master of dreams,
my soul I'll keep.

288
00:32:02,932 --> 00:32:05,663
Dream master.
I think I remember the rhyme.

289
00:32:09,508 --> 00:32:12,478
Kristen, get the hell
away from that house!

290
00:32:12,512 --> 00:32:13,980
¡Andale!

291
00:32:19,089 --> 00:32:21,115
You don't have to go
if you don't want to.

292
00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:22,319
I'll take care of you.

293
00:32:24,831 --> 00:32:25,991
I better go.

294
00:32:26,032 --> 00:32:27,557
OK...

295
00:32:27,602 --> 00:32:29,798
but I'll call you tonight,
and we'll get through this.

296
00:32:45,996 --> 00:32:47,487
Shotgun.

297
00:33:00,484 --> 00:33:02,214
Something the matter
with the cuisine?

298
00:33:03,321 --> 00:33:05,222
Well, Mom, I'll tell you...

299
00:33:05,257 --> 00:33:08,786
when two of your friends
die in the same day...

300
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:10,958
let me know what it does
to your appetite.

301
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,127
You're just tired.

302
00:33:12,168 --> 00:33:15,105
Don't think I haven't noticed
you aren't sleeping.

303
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:18,338
That has got to stop, honey.

304
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,750
What's wrong with me?

305
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:28,622
Adolescent anxiety.

306
00:33:28,659 --> 00:33:30,150
That'll make it better.

307
00:33:36,038 --> 00:33:37,768
Oh, God.

308
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:39,833
Mom, what did you do?

309
00:33:43,249 --> 00:33:45,844
Jesus! Sleeping pills?

310
00:33:47,221 --> 00:33:49,349
Look, Kristen, I'm sorry.

311
00:33:49,391 --> 00:33:50,859
Sorry?

312
00:33:50,893 --> 00:33:53,192
Sorry that you
and your tennis pals...

313
00:33:53,229 --> 00:33:55,596
torched this guy,
and now he's after me?

314
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:58,934
In case you haven't been
keeping score...

315
00:33:58,971 --> 00:34:02,568
it's his fucking banquet,
and I'm the last course!

316
00:34:02,611 --> 00:34:05,410
We went over this in therapy!

317
00:34:05,447 --> 00:34:07,382
No, Mother.

318
00:34:07,418 --> 00:34:09,319
You just murdered me.

319
00:34:09,354 --> 00:34:11,949
Take that
to your goddamn therapy.

320
00:34:59,562 --> 00:35:01,224
Dream someplace fun.

321
00:35:23,631 --> 00:35:25,725
Thanks, Alice.

322
00:35:28,906 --> 00:35:30,135
Hi, little girl.

323
00:35:32,478 --> 00:35:35,209
- What's your name?
- Alice.

324
00:35:35,248 --> 00:35:37,217
I have a friend named Alice.

325
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,088
Elm Street's last brat.

326
00:37:36,129 --> 00:37:38,257
Farewell.

327
00:37:38,299 --> 00:37:40,325
We beat you before!

328
00:37:40,369 --> 00:37:43,898
And now you're all alone!

329
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:47,673
Kristen, why don't you...

330
00:37:48,415 --> 00:37:50,475
call on one of
your little friends?

331
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:51,712
Maybe they could help.

332
00:37:51,753 --> 00:37:53,119
Never!

333
00:37:53,155 --> 00:37:55,454
I'm the last!

334
00:37:55,492 --> 00:37:57,928
Why don't you reach out...

335
00:37:57,962 --> 00:37:59,589
and cut someone?

336
00:38:19,461 --> 00:38:20,759
How sweet.

337
00:38:20,797 --> 00:38:22,766
Fresh meat.

338
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:29,973
Alice, wake up and get out!

339
00:38:30,978 --> 00:38:33,505
Alice, I'm so sorry.
It was a mistake.

340
00:38:33,549 --> 00:38:35,415
I pulled you in.

341
00:38:35,452 --> 00:38:38,354
Alice, come to Daddy.

342
00:38:38,388 --> 00:38:40,858
Leave her alone,
you son of a bitch!

343
00:38:42,429 --> 00:38:45,195
Now no one sleeps.

344
00:38:51,008 --> 00:38:53,341
The souls of my children.

345
00:38:56,516 --> 00:38:59,111
You'll need my power.

346
00:39:33,739 --> 00:39:35,070
Are you OK?

347
00:39:36,309 --> 00:39:38,505
Kristen...
we've gotta get to her house!

348
00:40:00,212 --> 00:40:01,840
Oh, God! Kristen!

349
00:40:01,881 --> 00:40:04,112
Let me go.

350
00:40:24,315 --> 00:40:27,342
Hi, Alice.
Wish you were here.

351
00:40:27,385 --> 00:40:30,015
Your horrible brother's
up to his old tricks.

352
00:40:30,057 --> 00:40:32,891
Rick, as long as I've known you,
I've always wanted to ask...

353
00:40:32,926 --> 00:40:35,863
what the hell this shit is
you put in your hair.

354
00:40:43,309 --> 00:40:44,572
I want his body.

355
00:40:44,612 --> 00:40:46,581
That's bullshit.
What else do you want?

356
00:40:46,615 --> 00:40:48,105
She wants my body.

357
00:40:52,624 --> 00:40:55,321
Alice, what are you doing?

358
00:40:57,264 --> 00:40:58,425
I don't know.

359
00:41:03,172 --> 00:41:05,141
It makes me feel better.

360
00:41:09,715 --> 00:41:11,183
What are you doing?

361
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:13,050
Hello, baby.

362
00:41:13,087 --> 00:41:14,247
Great.

363
00:41:15,591 --> 00:41:17,355
You made her so happy then.

364
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:21,592
Until all this Freddy shit.

365
00:41:23,269 --> 00:41:24,862
Why didn't I just stay with her?

366
00:41:24,904 --> 00:41:26,896
It wouldn't have made
any difference.

367
00:41:26,941 --> 00:41:28,933
Sure it would have.

368
00:41:28,977 --> 00:41:33,508
No. I saw it happen in my dream.

369
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:36,922
There was this horrible man.

370
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:41,088
I don't wanna hear
about Freddy, OK?

371
00:41:41,129 --> 00:41:44,065
I heard it all from Kristen,
so stop it.

372
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:47,094
I could smell the smoke.

373
00:41:47,138 --> 00:41:49,300
I could feel the heat
from the fire.

374
00:41:49,342 --> 00:41:51,641
- It wasn't a dream!
- Just stop it!

375
00:41:52,646 --> 00:41:55,115
She wasn't crazy
and neither are you...

376
00:41:55,149 --> 00:41:57,619
so just cut it out. Please.

377
00:41:59,289 --> 00:42:01,486
Jeez.
Why are you acting this way?

378
00:42:03,496 --> 00:42:04,987
I don't know, Rick.

379
00:42:06,066 --> 00:42:07,830
I just feel so different.

380
00:42:13,277 --> 00:42:15,473
Something happened in the dream.

381
00:42:16,782 --> 00:42:20,515
And now it's like
part of her is with me.

382
00:42:26,965 --> 00:42:28,433
I love you, too!

383
00:42:28,467 --> 00:42:30,129
Hello, everyone!

384
00:42:33,074 --> 00:42:35,771
Girl, I am so dead on my feet.

385
00:42:35,811 --> 00:42:38,782
- We have matching luggage.
- What do you mean?

386
00:42:38,816 --> 00:42:41,285
You didn't sleep last night?

387
00:42:41,319 --> 00:42:43,151
It's that obvious, huh?

388
00:42:43,188 --> 00:42:46,591
- Then you saw him, too.
- Saw who?

389
00:42:46,627 --> 00:42:48,892
I was up all night cramming
for that physics test.

390
00:42:50,299 --> 00:42:52,962
Oh, and I put this
little baby together.

391
00:42:53,004 --> 00:42:56,134
You know Deb's afraid of bugs.
I made it for her.

392
00:42:56,175 --> 00:42:58,144
Ultrahigh sound waves.

393
00:42:58,178 --> 00:43:00,409
It'll make 'em run,
screaming their antennas off.

394
00:43:02,684 --> 00:43:04,585
Look, I'll see you in class, OK?

395
00:43:16,639 --> 00:43:18,301
I don't smoke.

396
00:43:34,164 --> 00:43:37,624
All right,
you've got forty minutes.

397
00:43:37,669 --> 00:43:40,366
So good luck. Go for it.

398
00:45:10,309 --> 00:45:11,640
Help me!

399
00:45:11,677 --> 00:45:12,804
Help!

400
00:45:12,846 --> 00:45:14,974
Wake up!

401
00:45:15,016 --> 00:45:16,177
Wake up, damn it!

402
00:46:10,298 --> 00:46:12,767
Wanna suck face?

403
00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:19,811
Sheila, wake up!

404
00:46:24,753 --> 00:46:26,517
You flunked.

405
00:46:34,935 --> 00:46:36,334
Give her her thing.

406
00:46:43,248 --> 00:46:46,242
Didn't you see it? He was here.

407
00:46:46,286 --> 00:46:47,754
What are you talking about?

408
00:46:47,789 --> 00:46:48,949
He was here!

409
00:47:10,989 --> 00:47:12,457
Step back, please.

410
00:47:12,492 --> 00:47:13,652
Stand back.

411
00:47:18,233 --> 00:47:20,327
Asthma attack?

412
00:47:22,906 --> 00:47:26,207
What 17-year-old
has fatal asthma?

413
00:47:26,245 --> 00:47:29,216
God, she was gonna be a doctor.

414
00:47:29,249 --> 00:47:32,219
- It was Freddy.
- Enough with that crap!

415
00:47:32,254 --> 00:47:35,384
I saw it. It was my dream.

416
00:47:35,426 --> 00:47:37,258
I brought Sheila in.

417
00:47:40,098 --> 00:47:42,227
Oh, God.

418
00:47:42,269 --> 00:47:45,239
I brought Sheila in
like Kristen did with me.

419
00:47:45,273 --> 00:47:46,741
No, don't!

420
00:47:46,775 --> 00:47:48,573
I gave Sheila to him!

421
00:47:48,612 --> 00:47:50,672
And now she's dead!

422
00:47:54,787 --> 00:47:58,748
I really think Kristen's story
is getting to her.

423
00:47:58,793 --> 00:48:01,764
Dan, I really don't know
if it's a story.

424
00:48:01,798 --> 00:48:03,858
Look at us.

425
00:48:03,902 --> 00:48:05,803
We're dropping off
like flies here.

426
00:48:44,295 --> 00:48:47,356
- Good seeing you.
- Bye.

427
00:48:47,399 --> 00:48:48,924
Come on.

428
00:49:11,769 --> 00:49:14,604
Excuse me, miss.
Can I get a pack of gum?

429
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:21,240
Hey. Where you been?
I haven't seen you around.

430
00:49:21,285 --> 00:49:22,912
I've been working
double shifts.

431
00:49:22,953 --> 00:49:25,185
Guess you need
the extra money, huh?

432
00:49:25,223 --> 00:49:29,184
Look, you know why.
You don't want to believe me.

433
00:49:31,799 --> 00:49:33,768
Don't you understand?

434
00:49:33,802 --> 00:49:35,771
I can't sleep.

435
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:37,741
Someone might die.

436
00:49:49,159 --> 00:49:52,289
Let's say that
this is real, right?

437
00:49:52,330 --> 00:49:55,460
Why, all of a sudden,
is this Freddy guy after you?

438
00:50:02,513 --> 00:50:06,679
Kristen was the last child left
of the people who killed Freddy.

439
00:50:08,555 --> 00:50:11,525
Maybe Freddy
can't get to the new kids...

440
00:50:11,559 --> 00:50:13,893
unless there's someone
to bring them to him.

441
00:50:18,502 --> 00:50:20,664
We're gonna be late
for the drive-in.

442
00:50:20,705 --> 00:50:22,731
I have to get back.

443
00:50:26,382 --> 00:50:27,680
I guess I'll see you later.

444
00:50:40,336 --> 00:50:42,703
Ninety-three days
till summer vacation, man.

445
00:50:42,738 --> 00:50:45,868
- You tired?
- No. Worried.

446
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:47,879
Let's see if we can make it
until summer.

447
00:50:47,913 --> 00:50:49,381
It's like open season
around here.

448
00:50:49,416 --> 00:50:52,045
Pretty weird stuff.

449
00:50:52,087 --> 00:50:55,058
Speaking of weird,
you gotta feel for that guy.

450
00:50:55,091 --> 00:50:57,890
Dead girlfriend,
basket case for a sister...

451
00:50:57,928 --> 00:50:59,157
Shut up, asshole!

452
00:51:00,533 --> 00:51:02,468
What a dick.

453
00:51:02,502 --> 00:51:04,403
You know...

454
00:51:04,439 --> 00:51:05,906
You look wasted, man.

455
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:07,909
I've been up with Alice.

456
00:51:07,942 --> 00:51:09,342
Hey, how's she doing?

457
00:51:09,378 --> 00:51:11,347
I saw her last night
at the diner.

458
00:51:11,381 --> 00:51:13,350
She's blaming herself
for Sheila.

459
00:51:13,384 --> 00:51:15,353
I know how she feels.

460
00:51:15,387 --> 00:51:17,857
I think about Kristen
all the time.

461
00:51:17,892 --> 00:51:22,194
Maybe I could have stopped it
if I'd have listened.

462
00:51:22,231 --> 00:51:23,699
You mean Freddy?

463
00:51:23,733 --> 00:51:25,361
What else?

464
00:51:25,403 --> 00:51:27,372
You ever take a look
at our town's history?

465
00:51:27,406 --> 00:51:29,375
It's not exactly a safe place
to be a teenager.

466
00:51:29,409 --> 00:51:31,970
Hey, bozos, let's hustle... now.

467
00:51:33,914 --> 00:51:36,908
Well, if I'm next,
watch your back, man.

468
00:51:47,034 --> 00:51:48,525
Where were we?

469
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:53,900
Every society,
dating back to the ancients...

470
00:51:53,945 --> 00:51:56,414
has had theories
regarding dreams.

471
00:51:56,449 --> 00:51:59,909
What they mean,
how to control them.

472
00:51:59,953 --> 00:52:03,755
Aristotle believed during sleep
your soul roams free.

473
00:52:03,792 --> 00:52:06,262
What it sees are dreams.

474
00:52:06,297 --> 00:52:09,358
The skilled dreamers are able
to control what they see.

475
00:52:09,402 --> 00:52:12,737
There is a myth that there's
two gates your soul can enter.

476
00:52:12,773 --> 00:52:15,368
One is a positive gate...

477
00:52:15,411 --> 00:52:17,607
the other a negative gate.

478
00:52:17,648 --> 00:52:20,709
The key element is that
there's a dream master...

479
00:52:20,752 --> 00:52:22,880
someone who guards
the positive gate...

480
00:52:22,923 --> 00:52:25,392
and, in fact,
protects the sleeping host.

481
00:52:25,425 --> 00:52:28,885
Taken altogether, they offer
a fascinating perspective...

482
00:52:28,931 --> 00:52:30,399
on ancient history.

483
00:52:30,433 --> 00:52:32,902
Those of you who don't
find it fascinating...

484
00:52:32,938 --> 00:52:35,737
you better listen up,
because it's on the final.

485
00:53:09,591 --> 00:53:12,653
Rick, make me laugh.

486
00:53:18,437 --> 00:53:20,599
Going down.

487
00:53:54,492 --> 00:53:55,824
What?

488
00:54:08,947 --> 00:54:12,476
A true warrior needs no eyes.

489
00:54:18,829 --> 00:54:21,391
Come on out and fight me,
you chickenshit!

490
00:54:30,813 --> 00:54:34,114
Ninja warriors have calm.

491
00:54:34,152 --> 00:54:36,815
Find your balance, Rick!

492
00:54:38,991 --> 00:54:42,429
Too wimpy to show yourself,
Krueger?

493
00:54:45,703 --> 00:54:47,535
Well, how's this for balance?

494
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:04,419
Banzai.

495
00:55:07,368 --> 00:55:10,464
How you gonna fight me
without your weapon, Freddy?

496
00:55:17,650 --> 00:55:19,585
Sayonara, Rick-san!

497
00:55:32,573 --> 00:55:34,371
Though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...

498
00:55:34,409 --> 00:55:36,469
I shall fear no evil...

499
00:55:36,512 --> 00:55:38,845
for Thou art with me
with Thy rod and Thy staff.

500
00:55:38,882 --> 00:55:41,351
They comfort me.

501
00:55:41,385 --> 00:55:45,289
Dearly bereaved, we gather here
in remorse for Rick Johnson...

502
00:55:45,325 --> 00:55:49,161
a young man whose death
confounds and mystifies us...

503
00:55:49,197 --> 00:55:52,565
for Rick was in his prime,
beloved by all...

504
00:55:52,602 --> 00:55:54,868
exemplary
of young men's ideals...

505
00:55:54,905 --> 00:55:57,136
and of strong moral fiber.

506
00:55:57,176 --> 00:56:01,114
We grieve our loss but take
comfort in knowing such a man...

507
00:56:01,148 --> 00:56:03,117
rests in the kingdom of God.

508
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:05,586
Let our faith supersede
our knowledge...

509
00:56:05,622 --> 00:56:08,422
for truly the Lord
works in mysterious ways.

510
00:56:11,296 --> 00:56:14,756
Hello, baby!

511
00:56:21,112 --> 00:56:23,343
I love this.

512
00:56:25,785 --> 00:56:28,756
They think I'm dead, don't they?

513
00:56:28,790 --> 00:56:30,554
This is great.

514
00:56:32,461 --> 00:56:35,363
Hey. What's with the tears?

515
00:56:35,399 --> 00:56:38,859
I wouldn't leave ya.
Come on, don't cry.

516
00:56:38,904 --> 00:56:42,535
I'm here. It was a big joke
to fool Freddy.

517
00:56:42,576 --> 00:56:44,636
Come on, smile for me.

518
00:56:45,848 --> 00:56:47,646
No more daydreams.

519
00:56:47,685 --> 00:56:50,655
Well, gotta go.

520
00:57:00,036 --> 00:57:01,503
Good night.

521
00:57:05,277 --> 00:57:06,643
You OK?

522
00:57:08,449 --> 00:57:09,781
Not really.

523
00:57:12,188 --> 00:57:14,282
Is there anything we can do?

524
00:57:14,324 --> 00:57:15,849
I don't think so.

525
00:57:17,796 --> 00:57:20,892
I guess this is my own war.

526
00:57:20,935 --> 00:57:23,461
No, it's not.

527
00:57:23,504 --> 00:57:26,942
We all have to survive.

528
00:57:26,976 --> 00:57:29,309
I mean, I don't spend hours
working out...

529
00:57:29,346 --> 00:57:32,317
to let some night stalker
beat me.

530
00:57:32,351 --> 00:57:34,582
You don't really get it.

531
00:57:34,621 --> 00:57:36,590
He's not a night stalker.

532
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:41,295
And it'll take more
than bench presses to beat him.

533
00:57:41,332 --> 00:57:43,392
So what do we do?

534
00:57:43,435 --> 00:57:44,994
Let's go over
to Debbie's tonight.

535
00:57:45,038 --> 00:57:46,699
We have to make a plan.

536
00:57:48,843 --> 00:57:50,641
I got to go.

537
00:57:50,678 --> 00:57:52,670
How about I pick you up
at the diner at 8:00?

538
00:57:54,918 --> 00:57:56,546
Here. It's a good luck charm.

539
00:57:56,587 --> 00:57:59,819
Brings bad luck to the creep
you flatten with it.

540
00:57:59,858 --> 00:58:01,520
This is it.

541
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:05,222
Mind over matter.

542
00:58:13,747 --> 00:58:15,978
Mind over matter?

543
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:21,083
Sheila used to say that.

544
00:58:21,124 --> 00:58:24,493
God, every day, she changes.

545
00:58:24,529 --> 00:58:28,297
No. It's after every death.

546
00:59:45,051 --> 00:59:47,418
What's happening to me?

547
00:59:52,595 --> 00:59:55,087
Alice, where are you going?

548
00:59:55,131 --> 00:59:56,724
Just to see Debbie.

549
00:59:56,767 --> 00:59:58,030
No, you're not.

550
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:03,309
I want you to stay in.

551
01:00:03,343 --> 01:00:07,042
Dad, I gotta go, and there's
nothing you can do about it.

552
01:00:12,690 --> 01:00:15,354
You have no right to stop me.

553
01:00:18,734 --> 01:00:21,397
If you just knew
what was going on.

554
01:00:21,437 --> 01:00:25,170
I know very much what's going on
with you and your friends.

555
01:00:25,209 --> 01:00:29,671
Everybody thinks they know,
but they don't.

556
01:00:29,715 --> 01:00:30,876
Look at me, Alice.

557
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:35,951
I lost Rick
because I didn't watch him.

558
01:00:35,993 --> 01:00:38,087
I don't want to lose you.

559
01:00:38,129 --> 01:00:39,859
We're all we have.

560
01:01:14,616 --> 01:01:16,848
All the towns in America...

561
01:01:16,886 --> 01:01:19,355
and I gotta move
to the Bermuda Triangle.

562
01:01:20,726 --> 01:01:22,023
That's great.

563
01:03:08,921 --> 01:03:10,891
See ya, Alvin.

564
01:03:10,925 --> 01:03:12,552
Hey, he ain't no paper man.

565
01:03:12,593 --> 01:03:14,756
Why, don't you know him?
That's "Hot Fingers" Curly.

566
01:03:14,796 --> 01:03:17,197
Boy, he really swings out
hoppin' with a jive.

567
01:03:17,233 --> 01:03:19,498
- You want to dance?
- Do I?

568
01:06:01,513 --> 01:06:02,741
What'll it be?

569
01:06:07,255 --> 01:06:10,555
Come on, honey.
I don't want to be here forever.

570
01:06:15,266 --> 01:06:19,068
If the food don't kill ya,
the service will.

571
01:06:19,105 --> 01:06:21,199
Help us, Alice!

572
01:06:23,578 --> 01:06:25,479
The usual.

573
01:06:25,514 --> 01:06:27,575
No, Alice, don't let him do it!

574
01:06:27,619 --> 01:06:29,177
My favorite.

575
01:06:29,220 --> 01:06:30,688
No! Come on, no!

576
01:06:30,722 --> 01:06:32,122
Eeney, meeney, miney...

577
01:06:32,158 --> 01:06:33,717
Come on, no!

578
01:06:33,761 --> 01:06:34,921
Moe!

579
01:06:37,834 --> 01:06:39,427
No, Alice, don't let him do it!

580
01:06:39,469 --> 01:06:41,938
Rick, you little meatball.

581
01:06:41,972 --> 01:06:43,338
I love soul food.

582
01:06:43,374 --> 01:06:46,345
No! No! Stop!

583
01:06:54,625 --> 01:06:56,389
Bring me more.

584
01:07:04,473 --> 01:07:07,239
Your shift is over.

585
01:07:40,861 --> 01:07:42,260
Come on. We have to hurry!

586
01:07:42,296 --> 01:07:44,357
- What's going on?
- I'm driving.

587
01:07:53,413 --> 01:07:55,781
He's going after Debbie.
I've got to stop him.

588
01:07:55,817 --> 01:07:57,513
We got to stop him.
I'm with you on this thing.

589
01:07:57,553 --> 01:08:00,853
I want to help you.
I'm on your side, OK?

590
01:08:17,115 --> 01:08:18,481
Here we are.

591
01:08:27,096 --> 01:08:29,088
Come on. We have to hurry!

592
01:08:29,132 --> 01:08:31,329
- What's going on?
- I'm driving.

593
01:08:48,662 --> 01:08:50,460
I don't believe in you.

594
01:08:50,499 --> 01:08:52,661
I believe in you.

595
01:09:05,454 --> 01:09:08,322
No pain... no gain.

596
01:09:14,368 --> 01:09:17,827
He's going after Debbie.
I've got to stop him.

597
01:09:43,410 --> 01:09:47,678
Help me!

598
01:09:56,630 --> 01:09:58,030
Here we are.

599
01:10:05,110 --> 01:10:06,441
Come on. We have to hurry!

600
01:10:06,478 --> 01:10:08,310
- What's going on?
- I'm driving.

601
01:10:15,359 --> 01:10:17,555
He's going after Debbie.
I've got to stop him.

602
01:10:17,595 --> 01:10:20,430
I get the weirdest feeling
we've done this before.

603
01:11:03,196 --> 01:11:05,859
Come on. We have to hurry.
I'm driving.

604
01:11:05,901 --> 01:11:08,667
Oh, my God.

605
01:11:08,706 --> 01:11:10,173
We're both asleep.

606
01:11:10,207 --> 01:11:12,473
He's got us going in circles.

607
01:11:12,511 --> 01:11:14,446
We got to go!

608
01:11:33,075 --> 01:11:37,446
You can check in,
but you can't check out.

609
01:11:43,991 --> 01:11:45,983
What the hell was that?

610
01:11:48,298 --> 01:11:49,823
She's gone.

611
01:11:51,335 --> 01:11:54,602
I've collected her
like the others.

612
01:12:04,823 --> 01:12:07,315
All right,
I'm gonna punch his ticket in.

613
01:12:43,513 --> 01:12:45,311
I'm sorry.

614
01:12:45,482 --> 01:12:46,916
All right, get him in there.

615
01:12:55,064 --> 01:12:56,896
Base, this is med seven.

616
01:12:56,932 --> 01:13:01,668
We have a male Caucasian,
16-18 years of age.

617
01:13:01,707 --> 01:13:04,837
Multiple lacerations
about the head and neck area.

618
01:13:04,879 --> 01:13:07,178
Possible internal injuries.

619
01:13:07,215 --> 01:13:09,741
- What's that do?
- Relaxes your boyfriend.

620
01:13:09,786 --> 01:13:12,484
- Put the needle down.
- Rules is rules.

621
01:13:12,524 --> 01:13:14,356
He stays awake!

622
01:13:14,393 --> 01:13:16,453
Those are my rules, understand?

623
01:13:16,496 --> 01:13:17,862
Are you nuts?

624
01:13:17,899 --> 01:13:19,629
He's allergic, OK?

625
01:13:19,668 --> 01:13:22,695
You should have said something
in the first place.

626
01:13:22,739 --> 01:13:24,173
Damn kids.

627
01:13:25,376 --> 01:13:27,607
Don't let them put you to sleep.

628
01:13:27,646 --> 01:13:30,616
We have to get ready for him.

629
01:13:46,575 --> 01:13:49,512
- When does he have surgery?
- Fifteen minutes.

630
01:13:49,545 --> 01:13:50,978
Let him be, Alice!

631
01:13:53,251 --> 01:13:54,809
They're gonna kill him!

632
01:13:54,853 --> 01:13:56,685
What are you talking about?

633
01:13:56,722 --> 01:13:57,849
Let me go!

634
01:13:57,891 --> 01:14:00,087
Alice! Damn it! Get back here!

635
01:14:34,780 --> 01:14:36,077
Come on!

636
01:15:21,249 --> 01:15:22,876
No. No gas.

637
01:15:22,918 --> 01:15:25,388
No gas. No. Don't put...

638
01:16:50,216 --> 01:16:52,048
Fuckin' "A."

639
01:17:02,869 --> 01:17:05,805
Well, it ain't Dr. Seuss.

640
01:17:12,415 --> 01:17:15,386
Get away from him,
you son of a bitch!

641
01:17:27,672 --> 01:17:29,300
- I saw him. He was here.
- I know.

642
01:17:29,340 --> 01:17:31,605
We have to get out
of this place.

643
01:17:58,818 --> 01:18:01,879
Out for a spin, lovebirds?

644
01:18:01,922 --> 01:18:03,322
Dan, hold on!

645
01:18:28,963 --> 01:18:32,162
Alice, it's too late.

646
01:18:33,536 --> 01:18:34,663
He's hemorrhaging.

647
01:18:34,704 --> 01:18:36,866
Bring him out of it! Hurry!

648
01:18:50,795 --> 01:18:53,129
You got to put me
back under now!

649
01:18:53,166 --> 01:18:56,432
Relax, son. It was rough,
but we pulled you out.

650
01:18:56,470 --> 01:18:58,063
You're gonna be OK.

651
01:18:59,342 --> 01:19:04,112
One, two,
Freddy's coming for you

652
01:19:04,149 --> 01:19:08,679
Three, four,
better lock your door

653
01:19:08,723 --> 01:19:13,059
Five, six, grab your crucifix

654
01:19:13,095 --> 01:19:15,258
Seven, eight,
better stay up late

655
01:19:17,703 --> 01:19:22,108
Nine, ten, never sleep again

656
01:19:22,142 --> 01:19:25,011
Welcome to Wonderland, Alice.

657
01:20:20,897 --> 01:20:24,095
You've got their power.
I've got their souls.

658
01:20:24,135 --> 01:20:25,330
Come on.

659
01:20:47,137 --> 01:20:49,197
Banzai.

660
01:21:03,928 --> 01:21:07,092
You think
you've got what it takes?

661
01:21:08,668 --> 01:21:13,665
I've been guarding my gate
for a long time, bitch.

662
01:22:12,831 --> 01:22:17,635
I am eternal.

663
01:22:31,626 --> 01:22:36,089
Now I lay me down to sleep.

664
01:22:36,133 --> 01:22:42,268
The master of dreams,
my soul I'll keep.

665
01:22:42,308 --> 01:22:46,839
In the reflection
of my mind's eye...

666
01:22:46,882 --> 01:22:51,548
Evil will see itself,
and it shall die!

667
01:23:13,188 --> 01:23:15,089
Let them out!

668
01:23:33,451 --> 01:23:35,317
You're dead, Krueger.

669
01:24:46,995 --> 01:24:48,827
Thank you, Alice.

670
01:24:48,865 --> 01:24:50,527
You saved us.

671
01:24:51,634 --> 01:24:53,830
Freedom.

672
01:25:08,327 --> 01:25:10,421
Rest in hell.

673
01:26:02,308 --> 01:26:04,607
You know, I slept through
all of last night...

674
01:26:04,644 --> 01:26:06,613
and I haven't done that in days.

675
01:26:06,647 --> 01:26:09,014
I'm still having trouble.

676
01:26:09,050 --> 01:26:12,853
I can sleep two,
maybe three hours, if I'm lucky.

677
01:26:12,890 --> 01:26:14,187
I don't mind, though.

678
01:26:14,224 --> 01:26:16,786
I have more reasons
to stay awake now.

679
01:26:19,267 --> 01:26:20,428
Come on.

680
01:26:21,903 --> 01:26:23,030
Make a wish.

681
01:26:23,072 --> 01:26:26,168
Come on,
you don't believe in that stuff.

682
01:26:26,210 --> 01:26:29,807
Yeah, I do,
and I think you do, too.

683
01:26:31,752 --> 01:26:32,912
Here it goes.

684
01:26:42,668 --> 01:26:43,897
What'd you wish for?

685
01:26:53,083 --> 01:26:55,712
If I tell you,
it won't come true.
