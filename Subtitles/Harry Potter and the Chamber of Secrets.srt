1
00:01:13,282 --> 00:01:15,284
I can't let you out, Hedwig.

2
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,996
I'm not allowed to use magic
outside of school.

3
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:23,333
- Besides, if Uncle Vernon...
- Harry Potter!

4
00:01:25,169 --> 00:01:26,795
Now you've done it.

5
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:34,303
He's in there. Vernon?

6
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:40,434
I'm warning you, if you can't control
that bloody bird, it'll have to go.

7
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:42,394
But she's bored.

8
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:47,065
If I could only let her out
for an hour or two.

9
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:51,195
So you can send secret messages
to your freaky little friends? No, sir.

10
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:56,491
But I haven't had any messages
from any of my friends.

11
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,327
Not one...

12
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:00,204
...all summer.

13
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,624
Who would want to be
friends with you?

14
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:08,337
I should think you'd be
a little more grateful.

15
00:02:08,504 --> 00:02:12,007
We've raised you since you were a baby,
given you the food off our table...

16
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:14,301
...even let you have
Dudley's second bedroom...

17
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:17,012
...purely out of the goodness
of our hearts.

18
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:19,681
Not now.
It's for when the Masons arrive.

19
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,185
Which should be any minute.

20
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:26,688
Now, let's go over our schedule
once again, shall we?

21
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,774
Petunia, when the Masons arrive,
you will be...?

22
00:02:28,941 --> 00:02:32,653
In the lounge, waiting to welcome
them graciously to our home.

23
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:36,740
- Good. And, Dudley, you will be...?
- I'll be waiting to open the door.

24
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:38,825
Excellent.

25
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:45,207
And you?

26
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:50,170
I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise
and pretending that I don't exist.

27
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:52,047
Too right, you will.

28
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:55,717
With any luck, this could be the day
I make the biggest deal of my career...

29
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:59,429
...and you will not mess it up.

30
00:03:10,566 --> 00:03:15,404
Harry Potter, such an honor it is.

31
00:03:18,282 --> 00:03:23,203
- Who are you?
- Dobby, sir. Dobby the house-elf.

32
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:25,289
Not to be rude or anything...

33
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:29,418
...but this isn't a great time for me
to have a house-elf in my bedroom.

34
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:32,087
Yes, sir. Dobby understands.

35
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:35,382
It's just that Dobby
has come to tell you...

36
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:40,387
It is difficult, sir.
Dobby wonders where to begin.

37
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:46,351
- Why don't you sit down?
- Sit down? Sit down?

38
00:03:49,605 --> 00:03:54,109
Dobby, I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to offend you or anything.

39
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:56,445
Offend Dobby?

40
00:03:56,612 --> 00:03:58,947
Dobby has heard
of your greatness, sir...

41
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:04,912
...but never has he been asked
to sit down by a wizard, like an equal.

42
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:08,457
You can't have met
many decent wizards then.

43
00:04:08,624 --> 00:04:11,043
No, I haven't.

44
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,962
That was an awful thing to say.

45
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:18,091
- Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby!
- Stop, Dobby. Dobby, shush.

46
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,635
Dobby, please, stop.

47
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:26,767
Don't mind that. It's just the cat.

48
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:33,232
- Bad Dobby.
- Stop! Stop, Dobby. Please, be quiet.

49
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,692
Are you all right?

50
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:39,321
Dobby had to punish himself, sir.

51
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:42,699
Dobby almost spoke ill
of his family, sir.

52
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:46,828
- Your family?
- The wizard family Dobby serves, sir.

53
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:49,998
Dobby is bound to serve
one family forever.

54
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:52,709
If they ever knew Dobby was here...

55
00:04:54,336 --> 00:05:00,133
But Dobby had to come. Dobby has
to protect Harry Potter. To warn him.

56
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,594
Harry Potter must not go back...

57
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:07,474
...to Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year.

58
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:12,813
There is a plot, a plot to make
most terrible things happen.

59
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:16,316
What terrible things?
Who's plotting them?

60
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:19,653
Can't say.

61
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:25,826
- Okay, I understand. You can't say.
- Don't make me talk. L...

62
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:30,539
- Dobby. Dobby, put the lamp down.
- Bad Dobby.

63
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:34,751
So when they arrive
at the ninth hole...

64
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,923
Give me the lamp.

65
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:44,052
Dobby, stop!

66
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:49,224
- Let me go.
- Get in there and keep quiet.

67
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:53,437
- What the devil are you doing up here?
- I was just...

68
00:05:53,604 --> 00:05:56,356
You just ruined the punch line
of my Japanese golfer joke.

69
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,358
Sorry.

70
00:05:59,902 --> 00:06:03,989
One more sound and you'll wish
you'd never been born, boy.

71
00:06:04,156 --> 00:06:07,951
- And fix that door.
- Yes, sir.

72
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:11,872
See why I've got to go back?

73
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:15,792
I don't belong here.
I belong in your world, at Hogwarts.

74
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:20,589
- It's the only place I've got friends.
- Friends who don't write to Harry Potter?

75
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:23,675
Well, I expect they've been...

76
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:28,514
Hang on. How do you know
my friends haven't been writing to me?

77
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:32,059
Harry Potter mustn't
be angry with Dobby.

78
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:36,438
Dobby hoped if Harry Potter
thought his friends had forgotten him...

79
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:40,275
...Harry Potter might not want
to go back to school, sir.

80
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:45,864
- Give me those. Now.
- No!

81
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:01,463
Dobby, get back here.

82
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:07,970
Dobby, please, no.

83
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:12,307
Harry Potter must say
he's not going back to school.

84
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:15,102
I can't. Hogwarts is my home.

85
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:21,358
Then Dobby must do it, sir,
for Harry Potter's own good.

86
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:26,530
It spread as far as the eye could see,
all over the floor of this building.

87
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:28,657
One plumber said,
"Look at all that water. "

88
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:31,827
The second plumber said,
"Yes, and that's just the top of it. "

89
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:47,676
I'm so sorry. It's my nephew.
He's very disturbed.

90
00:07:47,843 --> 00:07:52,181
Meeting strangers upsets him.
That's why I kept him upstairs.

91
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:06,361
You're never going back to that school.

92
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:11,575
You're never going to see those
freaky friends of yours again. Never!

93
00:08:57,746 --> 00:08:58,872
Hiya, Harry.

94
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:04,419
Ron. Fred. George.
What are you all doing here?

95
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:08,465
Rescuing you, of course.
Now, come on, get your trunk.

96
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,890
You better stand back.

97
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:19,434
Let's go.

98
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:26,108
- What was that?
- What was it?

99
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:30,612
Potter!

100
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,447
Dad, what's going on?

101
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:36,743
Go. Go. Go.

102
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:37,953
Dad, hurry up.

103
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:41,999
- Come on.
- Come on, Harry, hurry up.

104
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:45,794
Petunia, he's escaping!

105
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:49,506
- I've got you, Harry.
- Come here!

106
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:51,800
- Let go of me!
- No, boy!

107
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:54,970
You and that bloody pigeon
aren't going anywhere.

108
00:09:55,137 --> 00:09:56,763
- Get off!
- Drive!

109
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,807
- Right.
- Right!

110
00:09:58,974 --> 00:10:00,642
No! No! No! No!

111
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:06,815
Dad!

112
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,451
Damn.

113
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:25,459
By the way, Harry, happy birthday.

114
00:10:51,777 --> 00:10:53,570
Come on.

115
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:58,200
Okay, come on.

116
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:01,245
Okay, come on.

117
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:13,549
- Think it'd be all right if we had some?
- Yeah, Mum will never know.

118
00:11:30,232 --> 00:11:33,443
It's not much, but it's home.

119
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,904
I think it's brilliant.

120
00:11:36,655 --> 00:11:40,409
Where have you been?

121
00:11:40,826 --> 00:11:43,871
Harry, how wonderful
to see you, dear.

122
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:47,624
Beds empty. No note. Car gone.

123
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:50,794
You could have died.
You could have been seen.

124
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:54,006
Of course, I don't
blame you, Harry, dear.

125
00:11:54,173 --> 00:11:57,217
They were starving him, Mum.
There were bars on his window.

126
00:11:57,384 --> 00:12:02,139
Well, you best hope I don't put bars
on your window, Ronald Weasley.

127
00:12:02,306 --> 00:12:04,433
Come on, Harry,
time for a spot of breakfast.

128
00:12:05,601 --> 00:12:08,353
Here we are, Harry. Now, tuck in.

129
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:12,107
That's it. There we go.

130
00:12:12,608 --> 00:12:16,111
- Mummy, have you seen my jumper?
- Yes, dear, it was on the cat.

131
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:18,363
Hello.

132
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:24,077
What did I do?

133
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:28,832
Ginny. She's been talking about you
all summer. A bit annoying, really.

134
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:31,627
- Morning, Weasleys.
- Morning, Dad.

135
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:36,340
- What a night. Nine raids. Nine!
- Raids?

136
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:40,469
Dad works in the Ministry of Magic,
in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office.

137
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:43,972
Dad loves Muggles,
thinks they're fascinating.

138
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:46,350
Well, now.

139
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:49,478
And who are you?

140
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:53,815
Sorry, sir. I'm Harry, sir.
Harry Potter.

141
00:12:54,233 --> 00:12:57,110
Good Lord. Are you really?

142
00:12:57,653 --> 00:13:01,990
Well, Ron has told us all about you,
of course. When did he get here?

143
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:03,659
This morning.

144
00:13:04,076 --> 00:13:09,039
Your sons flew that enchanted car
of yours to Surrey and back last night.

145
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:12,668
Did you really? How did it go?

146
00:13:12,835 --> 00:13:17,673
I mean... That was very wrong
indeed, boys. Very wrong of you.

147
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:22,845
Now, Harry, you must know
all about Muggles.

148
00:13:23,095 --> 00:13:27,140
Tell me, what exactly
is the function of a rubber duck?

149
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:34,481
Well, that'll be Errol with the post.

150
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:43,031
Fetch it, will you, Percy, please?

151
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:46,577
- Errol.
- He's always doing that.

152
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:52,207
Look, it's our Hogwarts letters.
They've sent us Harry's as well.

153
00:13:52,374 --> 00:13:55,419
Dumbledore must know you're here.
Doesn't miss a trick, that man.

154
00:13:55,586 --> 00:13:57,546
- No.
- This lot won't come cheap.

155
00:13:57,713 --> 00:14:02,050
- The spell books alone are expensive.
- We'll manage.

156
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:07,014
There's only one place we're going to
get all of this. Diagon Alley.

157
00:14:08,265 --> 00:14:09,641
Right.

158
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:11,935
Here we are, Harry.
You go first, dear.

159
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:15,063
But Harry's never traveled
by Floo powder before, Mum.

160
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,273
Floo powder?

161
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,736
You go first, Ron, so that Harry
can see how it's done. Yes.

162
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,238
In you go.

163
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,282
That's it.

164
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:30,496
Diagon Alley.

165
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:40,047
You see? It's quite easy, dear.
Don't be afraid. Come on.

166
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:43,008
Come on.

167
00:14:43,175 --> 00:14:46,386
In you go. That's it. Mind your head.

168
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:49,973
That's right.
Now, take your Floo powder.

169
00:14:51,517 --> 00:14:53,977
That's it, very good.

170
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:58,482
Now, don't forget to speak
very, very clearly.

171
00:15:00,317 --> 00:15:02,694
Diagonally.

172
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:11,578
- What did he say, dear?
- Diagonally.

173
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:12,830
I thought he did.

174
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:43,129
- Not lost, are you, my dear?
- I'm fine, thank you. I was just going...

175
00:16:44,296 --> 00:16:48,800
Come with us. We'll help you
find your way back.

176
00:16:49,343 --> 00:16:51,678
- No. Please...
- Harry?

177
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:52,930
Hagrid!

178
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:56,099
What do you think
you're doing down here? Come on.

179
00:17:01,897 --> 00:17:07,152
You're a mess, Harry. Skulking around
Knockturn Alley? Dodgy place.

180
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:11,323
Don't want no one to see you there.
People will think you're up to no good.

181
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,742
I was lost, I...

182
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:16,870
Hang on. What were you
doing down there then?

183
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:22,167
Me? I was... I was looking
for Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent.

184
00:17:22,334 --> 00:17:25,254
They're ruining all the school cabbages.

185
00:17:30,676 --> 00:17:32,845
Harry. Hagrid.

186
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:34,471
Hello, Hermione.

187
00:17:34,847 --> 00:17:37,474
- It's so good to see you.
- It's great to see you too.

188
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:40,727
What did you do to your glasses?

189
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:43,772
<i>Oculus Reparo.</i>

190
00:17:47,234 --> 00:17:49,987
I definitely need to remember that one.

191
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:53,866
You'll be all right now then, Harry?
Right. I'll leave you to it.

192
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:55,492
- Okay, bye.
- Thank you. Bye.

193
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:57,661
Come on, everyone's been so worried.

194
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,506
Harry.

195
00:18:09,673 --> 00:18:12,885
Thank goodness. We'd hoped
you'd only gone one grate too far.

196
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:15,888
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Gilderoy Lockhart.

197
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:18,348
Here he is.

198
00:18:22,352 --> 00:18:23,979
Mum fancies him.

199
00:18:24,146 --> 00:18:27,399
Make way there, please.
Let me by, madam. Thank you.

200
00:18:27,608 --> 00:18:31,028
<i>Excuse me, little girl.
This is for the Daily Prophet.</i>

201
00:18:35,199 --> 00:18:38,076
It can't be. Harry Potter?

202
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,497
Harry Potter!

203
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:42,873
Excuse me, madam.

204
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:48,712
Nice big smile, Harry.
Together, you and I rate the front page.

205
00:18:48,879 --> 00:18:52,049
Ladies and gentlemen,
what an extraordinary moment this is.

206
00:18:52,466 --> 00:18:55,636
When young Harry stepped
into Flourish and Blotts this morning...

207
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:59,890
<i>...to purchase my autobiography,
Magical Me...</i>

208
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:06,271
...which, incidentally,
is currently celebrating...

209
00:19:06,438 --> 00:19:11,276
<i>...its 27th week atop
the Daily Prophet bestseller list...</i>

210
00:19:11,443 --> 00:19:15,948
...he had no idea that he would,
in fact, be leaving...

211
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:22,037
...with my entire collected works...

212
00:19:22,621 --> 00:19:24,832
...free of charge.

213
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,253
Now, ladies?

214
00:19:29,461 --> 00:19:32,589
Harry, now you give me those,
and I'll get them signed.

215
00:19:32,756 --> 00:19:36,260
All of you wait outside.
That's it.

216
00:19:45,561 --> 00:19:48,063
I'll bet you loved that,
didn't you, Potter?

217
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:52,734
Famous Harry Potter. Can't go into a
bookshop without making the front page.

218
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,070
Leave him alone.

219
00:19:55,237 --> 00:19:58,740
Look, Potter.
You've got yourself a girlfriend.

220
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:02,953
Now, now, Draco, play nicely.

221
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:04,580
Mr. Potter.

222
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:11,003
Lucius Malfoy. We meet at last.

223
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:13,380
Forgive me.

224
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:16,800
Your scar is legend.

225
00:20:17,342 --> 00:20:19,595
As, of course, is the wizard
who gave it to you.

226
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:22,097
Voldemort killed my parents.

227
00:20:24,183 --> 00:20:27,644
He was nothing more than a murderer.

228
00:20:28,687 --> 00:20:31,607
You must be very brave
to mention his name.

229
00:20:32,274 --> 00:20:33,609
Or very foolish.

230
00:20:34,026 --> 00:20:37,571
Fear of a name only increases
fear of the thing itself.

231
00:20:39,156 --> 00:20:42,451
And you must be Miss Granger.

232
00:20:45,287 --> 00:20:49,583
Yes, Draco has told me
all about you. And your parents.

233
00:20:54,213 --> 00:20:57,674
Muggles, aren't they?

234
00:21:00,636 --> 00:21:05,724
Let me see.
Red hair, vacant expressions...

235
00:21:07,142 --> 00:21:10,479
...tatty, secondhand book.

236
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:14,024
You must be the Weasleys.

237
00:21:14,483 --> 00:21:16,485
It's mad in here.
Let's go outside.

238
00:21:16,652 --> 00:21:20,364
- Well, well, well. Weasley senior.
- Lucius.

239
00:21:20,572 --> 00:21:25,244
Busy time at the Ministry, Arthur,
all those extra raids?

240
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:27,746
I do hope they're paying you overtime...

241
00:21:27,913 --> 00:21:31,083
...but judging by the state of this,
I'd say not.

242
00:21:32,876 --> 00:21:36,630
What's the use in being a disgrace
to the name of wizard...

243
00:21:36,797 --> 00:21:38,882
...if they don't even pay you well for it?

244
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:44,179
We have a very different idea about what
disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy.

245
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:46,223
Clearly.

246
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:52,020
Associating with Muggles.

247
00:21:56,233 --> 00:22:00,821
And I thought your family
could sink no lower.

248
00:22:04,116 --> 00:22:06,910
I'll see you at work.

249
00:22:11,081 --> 00:22:13,417
See you at school.

250
00:22:21,258 --> 00:22:23,927
- 10:58, come on.
- The train will be leaving any moment.

251
00:22:24,094 --> 00:22:27,389
Fred, George, Percy, you first.

252
00:22:32,978 --> 00:22:34,605
Okay.

253
00:22:40,652 --> 00:22:42,404
After you, dear.

254
00:22:44,573 --> 00:22:47,784
Come on, Ginny,
we'll get you a seat. Hurry.

255
00:22:49,077 --> 00:22:51,163
Let's go.

256
00:23:05,093 --> 00:23:08,263
- What do you two think you're doing?
- Sorry.

257
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,683
Lost control of the trolley.

258
00:23:13,018 --> 00:23:15,354
- Why can't we get through?
- I don't know.

259
00:23:15,521 --> 00:23:18,899
The gateway has sealed
itself for some reason.

260
00:23:20,275 --> 00:23:24,196
The train leaves at exactly 11:00.
We've missed it.

261
00:23:24,363 --> 00:23:27,741
Harry, if we can't get through...

262
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:30,702
...maybe Mum and Dad can't get back.

263
00:23:31,662 --> 00:23:35,123
Maybe we should just go
and wait by the car.

264
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:37,501
The car.

265
00:23:49,012 --> 00:23:51,181
Ron, I should tell you...

266
00:23:51,348 --> 00:23:55,143
...most Muggles aren't accustomed
to seeing a flying car.

267
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,395
Right.

268
00:23:56,687 --> 00:23:57,729
Okay.

269
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:18,333
Oh, no! The Invisibility Booster
must be faulty.

270
00:24:18,792 --> 00:24:21,920
Come on, then. Let's go lower.
We need to find the train.

271
00:24:22,087 --> 00:24:23,380
Okay.

272
00:24:34,308 --> 00:24:36,351
All we need to do is catch up
with the train.

273
00:24:36,518 --> 00:24:38,187
We can't be far behind.

274
00:24:40,189 --> 00:24:42,900
- Do you hear that?
- We must be getting close.

275
00:24:43,275 --> 00:24:45,444
Hold on.

276
00:25:11,762 --> 00:25:13,931
Harry!

277
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:18,393
Hold on!

278
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:24,233
Take my hand!

279
00:25:28,487 --> 00:25:29,738
Hold on!

280
00:25:29,905 --> 00:25:33,492
I'm trying. Your hand's all sweaty.

281
00:25:46,088 --> 00:25:49,383
- I think we found the train.
- Yeah.

282
00:26:06,066 --> 00:26:07,317
Welcome home.

283
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:24,668
Up! Up!

284
00:26:25,627 --> 00:26:27,796
It's not working!

285
00:26:31,717 --> 00:26:34,303
Up! Ron, mind that tree!

286
00:26:37,556 --> 00:26:39,683
Stop! Stop! Stop!

287
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:07,419
- My wand. Look at my wand.
- Be thankful it's not your neck.

288
00:27:09,046 --> 00:27:12,049
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

289
00:27:47,501 --> 00:27:49,628
Come on, go! Fast!

290
00:28:23,996 --> 00:28:26,790
Scabbers, you're okay.

291
00:28:28,292 --> 00:28:30,335
The car!

292
00:28:45,809 --> 00:28:47,644
Dad's gonna kill me.

293
00:28:56,195 --> 00:28:58,530
See you, Hedwig.

294
00:28:59,865 --> 00:29:02,201
So a house-elf shows up
in my bedroom...

295
00:29:02,367 --> 00:29:05,329
...we can't get through the barrier
to platform 93/4...

296
00:29:05,496 --> 00:29:08,749
...we almost get killed by a tree...

297
00:29:08,916 --> 00:29:12,461
Clearly someone doesn't want me
here this year.

298
00:29:16,048 --> 00:29:19,009
Well, take a good look, lads.

299
00:29:19,176 --> 00:29:23,096
This night might well be
the last you spend in this castle.

300
00:29:25,891 --> 00:29:29,394
Oh, dear, we are in trouble.

301
00:29:29,686 --> 00:29:35,059
You were seen by no less
than seven Muggles.

302
00:29:36,318 --> 00:29:39,071
Do you have any idea
how serious this is?

303
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:43,617
You have risked
the exposure of our world.

304
00:29:44,284 --> 00:29:47,204
Not to mention the damage you
inflicted on a Whomping Willow...

305
00:29:47,371 --> 00:29:50,541
...that's been on these grounds
since before you were born.

306
00:29:50,999 --> 00:29:54,545
Honestly, Professor Snape,
I think it did more damage to us.

307
00:29:54,711 --> 00:29:55,879
Silence.

308
00:29:57,881 --> 00:30:03,263
I assure you that were you in Slytherin,
and your fate rested with me...

309
00:30:04,429 --> 00:30:08,225
...the both of you would be
on the train home tonight.

310
00:30:09,393 --> 00:30:11,645
- As it is...
- They are not.

311
00:30:13,856 --> 00:30:17,901
Professor Dumbledore.
Professor McGonagall.

312
00:30:18,277 --> 00:30:19,778
Headmaster...

313
00:30:19,945 --> 00:30:24,741
...these boys have flouted the Decree
for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry.

314
00:30:24,908 --> 00:30:28,829
- As such...
- I am well aware of our bylaws...

315
00:30:28,996 --> 00:30:31,874
...having written
quite a few of them myself.

316
00:30:32,249 --> 00:30:35,460
However, as head of Gryffindor house...

317
00:30:35,627 --> 00:30:40,632
...it is for Professor McGonagall
to determine the appropriate action.

318
00:30:41,091 --> 00:30:43,260
We'll go and get our stuff, then.

319
00:30:43,427 --> 00:30:45,888
What are you
talking about, Mr. Weasley?

320
00:30:46,054 --> 00:30:48,265
You're going to expel us, aren't you?

321
00:30:49,808 --> 00:30:52,936
Not today, Mr. Weasley...

322
00:30:53,103 --> 00:30:58,108
...but I must impress on both of you
the seriousness of what you have done.

323
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:03,280
I will be writing to your families tonight,
and you will both receive detention.

324
00:31:27,638 --> 00:31:30,140
Morning, everyone.

325
00:31:30,807 --> 00:31:33,352
- Good morning, everyone.
- Good morning, Professor Sprout.

326
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:37,814
Welcome to Greenhouse Three,
second years. Gather around, everyone.

327
00:31:37,981 --> 00:31:40,817
Today we're going to re-pot Mandrakes.

328
00:31:40,984 --> 00:31:44,988
Who here can tell me
the properties of the Mandrake root?

329
00:31:45,155 --> 00:31:46,990
Yes, Miss Granger?

330
00:31:47,157 --> 00:31:49,493
Mandrake, or Mandragora...

331
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:54,665
...is used to return those who have been
Petrified to their original state.

332
00:31:54,832 --> 00:31:59,837
It's also dangerous. The Mandrake's
cry is fatal to anyone who hears it.

333
00:32:00,003 --> 00:32:02,840
Excellent. Ten points to Gryffindor.

334
00:32:03,006 --> 00:32:05,676
As our Mandrakes
are still only seedlings...

335
00:32:05,843 --> 00:32:07,761
...their cries won't kill you yet.

336
00:32:07,928 --> 00:32:11,723
But they could knock you out for hours,
which is why I have given you earmuffs...

337
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:13,392
...for auditory protection.

338
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:18,021
So could you please put them on,
right away? Quickly.

339
00:32:18,188 --> 00:32:20,983
Flaps tight down,
and watch me closely.

340
00:32:21,149 --> 00:32:24,152
You grasp your Mandrake firmly.

341
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:27,322
You pull it sharply up out of the pot.

342
00:32:31,577 --> 00:32:33,495
Got it? And...

343
00:32:33,704 --> 00:32:35,831
...now you dunk it down
into the other pot...

344
00:32:35,998 --> 00:32:40,711
...and pour a little sprinkling of soil
to keep him warm.

345
00:32:44,339 --> 00:32:47,551
Longbottom's been neglecting
his earmuffs.

346
00:32:47,968 --> 00:32:52,014
- No, ma'am, he's just fainted.
- Yes, well, just leave him there.

347
00:32:52,389 --> 00:32:55,934
Right, on we go.
Plenty of pots to go around.

348
00:32:56,101 --> 00:32:59,688
Grasp your Mandrake and pull it up.

349
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:18,415
- There's Nearly Headless Nick.
- Hello, Percy, Miss Clearwater.

350
00:33:18,582 --> 00:33:21,126
Hello, Sir Nicholas.

351
00:33:32,596 --> 00:33:35,891
Say it. I'm doomed.

352
00:33:36,725 --> 00:33:38,644
- You're doomed.
- Hi, Harry.

353
00:33:40,896 --> 00:33:43,607
I'm Colin Creevey. I'm in Gryffindor too.

354
00:33:43,774 --> 00:33:45,400
Hi, Colin. Nice to meet you.

355
00:33:45,943 --> 00:33:47,778
Ron, is that your owl?

356
00:34:02,501 --> 00:34:05,170
Bloody bird's a menace.

357
00:34:09,383 --> 00:34:10,884
Oh, no.

358
00:34:11,051 --> 00:34:14,513
Look, everyone.
Weasley's got himself a Howler.

359
00:34:15,973 --> 00:34:21,228
Go on, Ron. I ignored one
from my gran once. It was horrible.

360
00:34:28,402 --> 00:34:30,279
<i>Ronald Weasley!</i>

361
00:34:32,906 --> 00:34:38,096
<i>How dare you steal that car!
I am absolutely disgusted!</i>

362
00:34:39,288 --> 00:34:41,874
<i>Your father's now facing
an inquiry at work...</i>

363
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,418
<i>...nd it's entirely your fault!</i>

364
00:34:44,877 --> 00:34:48,755
<i>If you put another toe out of line...</i>

365
00:34:48,922 --> 00:34:52,176
<i>...we'll bring you straight home!</i>

366
00:34:52,968 --> 00:34:56,471
<i>And, Ginny, dear, congratulations
on making Gryffindor.</i>

367
00:34:56,638 --> 00:35:00,350
<i>Your father and I are so proud.</i>

368
00:35:18,619 --> 00:35:24,042
Let me introduce you to your new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

369
00:35:25,209 --> 00:35:26,752
Me.

370
00:35:26,919 --> 00:35:29,463
Gilderoy Lockhart...

371
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:32,925
...Order of Merlin, Third Class...

372
00:35:33,091 --> 00:35:36,428
...honorary member
of the Dark Force Defense League...

373
00:35:36,595 --> 00:35:39,515
...and five times winner...

374
00:35:39,848 --> 00:35:45,729
<i>...of Witch Weekly's
Most-Charming-Smile Award.</i>

375
00:35:46,104 --> 00:35:47,606
But I don't talk about that.

376
00:35:47,773 --> 00:35:52,319
I didn't get rid of the Bandon Banshee
by smiling at him.

377
00:35:56,073 --> 00:35:58,909
Now, be warned.

378
00:35:59,201 --> 00:36:01,245
It is my job to arm you...

379
00:36:01,411 --> 00:36:06,750
...against the foulest creatures
known to wizardkind.

380
00:36:07,584 --> 00:36:11,171
You may find yourselves facing
your worst fears in this room.

381
00:36:11,338 --> 00:36:15,384
Know only that no harm
can befall you whilst I am here.

382
00:36:15,551 --> 00:36:18,470
I must ask you not to scream.

383
00:36:18,637 --> 00:36:21,223
It might provoke them.

384
00:36:24,685 --> 00:36:26,228
Cornish pixies?

385
00:36:26,395 --> 00:36:29,439
Freshly caught Cornish pixies.

386
00:36:30,232 --> 00:36:32,359
Laugh if you will, Mr. Finnegan...

387
00:36:32,526 --> 00:36:36,697
...but pixies can be
devilishly tricky little blighters.

388
00:36:36,864 --> 00:36:39,783
Let's see what you make of them.

389
00:36:44,121 --> 00:36:47,374
Come on now, round them up.
They're only pixies.

390
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:07,269
- You just stay there!
- Please, get me down!

391
00:37:09,605 --> 00:37:12,065
- Get off me!
- Stop. Hold still!

392
00:37:13,692 --> 00:37:16,904
<i>Peskipiksi Pesternomi!</i>

393
00:37:36,882 --> 00:37:41,178
I'll ask you three to just nip
the rest of them back into their cage.

394
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:45,098
What do we do now?

395
00:37:46,558 --> 00:37:48,060
<i>Immobulus!</i>

396
00:37:57,569 --> 00:37:59,822
Why is it always me?

397
00:38:06,161 --> 00:38:08,872
I spent the summer devising
a whole new Quidditch program.

398
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:12,709
We're gonna train earlier,
harder and longer.

399
00:38:12,876 --> 00:38:16,171
What...? I don't believe it.

400
00:38:18,966 --> 00:38:21,677
- Where you think you're going, Flint?
- Quidditch practice.

401
00:38:21,844 --> 00:38:26,223
- I booked the pitch for Gryffindor today.
- Easy, Wood. I've got a note.

402
00:38:27,641 --> 00:38:29,852
I smell trouble.

403
00:38:30,435 --> 00:38:33,981
"I, Professor Severus Snape,
do hereby give the Slytherin team...

404
00:38:34,147 --> 00:38:37,651
...permission to practice today, owing
to the need to train their new Seeker. "

405
00:38:37,818 --> 00:38:40,487
You've got a new Seeker. Who?

406
00:38:44,449 --> 00:38:47,077
- Malfoy?
- That's right.

407
00:38:47,244 --> 00:38:50,038
And that's not all
that's new this year.

408
00:38:50,873 --> 00:38:54,293
Those are Nimbus 2001 s.
How did you get those?

409
00:38:54,459 --> 00:38:56,545
A gift from Draco's father.

410
00:38:56,712 --> 00:39:00,465
You see, Weasley, unlike some,
my father can afford the best.

411
00:39:00,632 --> 00:39:03,635
At least no one on the Gryffindor team
had to buy their way in.

412
00:39:03,802 --> 00:39:06,722
They got in on pure talent.

413
00:39:09,933 --> 00:39:13,812
No one asked your opinion,
you filthy little Mudblood.

414
00:39:16,315 --> 00:39:19,776
You'll pay for that one, Malfoy.
Eat slugs!

415
00:39:27,326 --> 00:39:29,203
You okay, Ron?

416
00:39:32,206 --> 00:39:33,999
Say something.

417
00:39:40,255 --> 00:39:44,760
- Wow! Can you turn him around, Harry?
- No, Colin, get out of the way.

418
00:39:45,677 --> 00:39:47,721
Let's take him to Hagrid's.

419
00:39:47,888 --> 00:39:50,015
He'll know what to do.

420
00:39:58,899 --> 00:40:02,277
This calls for
a specialist's equipment.

421
00:40:06,031 --> 00:40:09,618
Nothing to do but wait till it stops,
I'm afraid.

422
00:40:10,285 --> 00:40:13,455
- Okay.
- Better out than in.

423
00:40:14,039 --> 00:40:19,378
- Who was Ron trying to curse, anyway?
- Malfoy. He called Hermione...

424
00:40:20,587 --> 00:40:24,007
Well, I don't know
exactly what it means.

425
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:30,180
He called me a Mudblood.

426
00:40:30,347 --> 00:40:33,016
- He did not.
- What's a Mudblood?

427
00:40:33,392 --> 00:40:37,938
It means "dirty blood. " Mudblood's a foul
name for someone who's Muggle-born.

428
00:40:38,105 --> 00:40:42,359
Someone with non-magic parents.
Someone like me.

429
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:46,989
It's not a term one usually hears
in civilized conversation.

430
00:40:48,157 --> 00:40:52,953
See, the thing is, Harry, there are
some wizards, like the Malfoy family...

431
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:57,791
...who think they're better than everyone
else because they're pure-blood.

432
00:40:57,958 --> 00:40:59,585
That's horrible.

433
00:41:02,588 --> 00:41:03,922
It's disgusting.

434
00:41:04,089 --> 00:41:07,593
And it's codswallop to boot.
Dirty blood.

435
00:41:07,759 --> 00:41:11,138
Why, there isn't a wizard alive today
that's not half-blood or less.

436
00:41:11,305 --> 00:41:15,851
More to the point, they've yet to think
of a spell that our Hermione can't do.

437
00:41:16,018 --> 00:41:18,228
Come here.

438
00:41:19,354 --> 00:41:25,019
Don't you think on it, Hermione.
Don't you think on it for one minute.

439
00:41:33,577 --> 00:41:36,622
Harry, Harry, Harry.

440
00:41:36,788 --> 00:41:39,041
Can you possibly imagine...

441
00:41:39,208 --> 00:41:42,419
...a better way to serve detention...

442
00:41:43,045 --> 00:41:45,756
...than by helping me
to answer my fan mail?

443
00:41:45,923 --> 00:41:47,341
Not really.

444
00:41:47,508 --> 00:41:53,089
Fame is a fickle friend, Harry.
Celebrity is as celebrity does.

445
00:41:54,056 --> 00:41:55,974
Remember that.

446
00:41:59,728 --> 00:42:01,897
<i>Come.</i>

447
00:42:02,064 --> 00:42:04,191
<i>Come...</i>

448
00:42:05,442 --> 00:42:08,320
<i>...to me.</i>

449
00:42:11,615 --> 00:42:14,159
- What?
- Sorry?

450
00:42:16,411 --> 00:42:18,372
That voice.

451
00:42:18,539 --> 00:42:20,082
Voice?

452
00:42:23,627 --> 00:42:28,257
- Didn't you hear it?
- What are you talking about, Harry?

453
00:42:28,882 --> 00:42:32,469
I think you're getting
a bit drowsy.

454
00:42:32,636 --> 00:42:36,723
And great Scott, no wonder. Look at the
time. We've been here nearly four hours.

455
00:42:37,015 --> 00:42:40,394
Spooky how the time flies
when one is having fun.

456
00:42:45,357 --> 00:42:47,901
Spooky.

457
00:42:50,946 --> 00:42:53,073
<i>Blood.</i>

458
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:56,785
<i>I smell blood.</i>

459
00:42:56,952 --> 00:43:00,038
<i>Let me rip you.</i>

460
00:43:00,205 --> 00:43:03,792
<i>Let me kill you.</i>

461
00:43:05,627 --> 00:43:07,087
<i>Kill!</i>

462
00:43:08,005 --> 00:43:09,339
<i>Kill!</i>

463
00:43:10,048 --> 00:43:11,967
<i>- Kill!
- Harry!</i>

464
00:43:12,134 --> 00:43:14,636
- Did you hear it?
- Hear what?

465
00:43:14,803 --> 00:43:18,223
- That voice.
- Voice? What voice?

466
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:22,352
I heard it first in Lockhart's office.
And then again just...

467
00:43:22,644 --> 00:43:24,730
<i>It's time.</i>

468
00:43:24,897 --> 00:43:28,108
It's moving.
I think it's going to kill.

469
00:43:29,067 --> 00:43:33,030
- Kill?
- Harry, wait! Not so fast!

470
00:43:58,597 --> 00:44:00,682
Strange.

471
00:44:01,183 --> 00:44:05,687
- I've never seen spiders act like that.
- I don't like spiders.

472
00:44:09,817 --> 00:44:11,860
What's that?

473
00:44:15,322 --> 00:44:19,868
"The Chamber of Secrets has been
opened. Enemies of the Heir, beware. "

474
00:44:20,035 --> 00:44:22,287
It's written in blood.

475
00:44:25,207 --> 00:44:27,376
Oh, no.

476
00:44:32,089 --> 00:44:34,383
It's Filch's cat.

477
00:44:34,883 --> 00:44:37,177
It's Mrs. Norris.

478
00:44:53,235 --> 00:44:55,946
"Enemies of the Heir, beware. "

479
00:44:57,447 --> 00:44:59,825
You'll be next, Mudbloods.

480
00:44:59,992 --> 00:45:05,164
What's going on here?
Go on. Make way, make way.

481
00:45:06,623 --> 00:45:08,458
Potter?

482
00:45:08,625 --> 00:45:10,752
What are you...?

483
00:45:14,089 --> 00:45:16,383
Mrs. Norris?

484
00:45:17,885 --> 00:45:22,055
- You've murdered my cat.
- No. No.

485
00:45:22,431 --> 00:45:23,724
I'll kill you.

486
00:45:26,059 --> 00:45:28,896
- I'll kill you!
- Argus!

487
00:45:30,272 --> 00:45:32,441
Argus, I...

488
00:45:34,443 --> 00:45:39,072
Everyone will proceed
to their dormitories immediately.

489
00:45:39,781 --> 00:45:41,783
Everyone except...

490
00:45:42,576 --> 00:45:44,786
...you three.

491
00:45:46,914 --> 00:45:49,666
Ravenclaws, follow me.

492
00:45:51,543 --> 00:45:55,422
She's not dead, Argus.
She has been Petrified.

493
00:45:55,589 --> 00:45:58,425
Thought so.
So unlucky I wasn't there.

494
00:45:58,592 --> 00:46:01,803
I know exactly the countercurse
that could've spared her.

495
00:46:04,139 --> 00:46:06,767
But how she has been Petrified,
I cannot say.

496
00:46:07,017 --> 00:46:09,728
Ask him.
It's him that's done it.

497
00:46:09,895 --> 00:46:12,606
You saw what he wrote on the wall.

498
00:46:12,773 --> 00:46:16,860
It's not true, sir. I swear.
I never touched Mrs. Norris.

499
00:46:17,027 --> 00:46:21,490
- Rubbish.
- Lf I might, headmaster?

500
00:46:21,949 --> 00:46:26,745
Perhaps Potter and his friends were just
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

501
00:46:27,246 --> 00:46:29,164
However...

502
00:46:29,498 --> 00:46:32,459
...the circumstances are suspicious.

503
00:46:32,626 --> 00:46:37,256
I, for one, don't recall
seeing Potter at dinner.

504
00:46:37,422 --> 00:46:39,675
I'm afraid that's my doing, Severus.

505
00:46:39,842 --> 00:46:43,262
You see, Harry was helping me
answer my fan mail.

506
00:46:43,428 --> 00:46:46,723
That's why Ron and I
went looking for him, professor.

507
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:49,643
We'd just found him when he said...

508
00:46:51,895 --> 00:46:55,732
- Yes, Miss Granger?
- When I said I wasn't hungry.

509
00:46:57,109 --> 00:47:01,113
We were heading back to the common
room when we found Mrs. Norris.

510
00:47:03,448 --> 00:47:08,996
- Innocent until proven guilty, Severus.
- My cat has been Petrified.

511
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:15,669
- I want to see some punishment!
- We will be able to cure her, Argus.

512
00:47:16,587 --> 00:47:21,383
As I understand it, Madam Sprout
has a very healthy growth of Mandrake.

513
00:47:21,550 --> 00:47:25,971
When matured, a potion will be made
which will revive Mrs. Norris.

514
00:47:26,305 --> 00:47:28,015
And in the meantime...

515
00:47:28,557 --> 00:47:32,561
...I strongly recommend caution...

516
00:47:33,228 --> 00:47:35,230
...to all.

517
00:47:46,241 --> 00:47:49,703
- It's a bit strange, isn't it?
- Strange?

518
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:52,623
You hear this voice,
a voice only you can hear...

519
00:47:52,789 --> 00:47:57,503
...and then Mrs. Norris turns up
Petrified. It's just strange.

520
00:47:57,669 --> 00:48:00,923
Do you think I should have told them?
Dumbledore and the others, I mean?

521
00:48:01,089 --> 00:48:02,549
Are you mad?

522
00:48:02,716 --> 00:48:08,222
No, Harry. Even in the wizarding world,
hearing voices isn't a good sign.

523
00:48:10,307 --> 00:48:12,684
She's right, you know.

524
00:48:17,022 --> 00:48:19,358
Could I have your attention,
please?

525
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:25,405
Right. Now, today,
we will be transforming animals...

526
00:48:25,572 --> 00:48:27,950
...into water goblets.

527
00:48:28,867 --> 00:48:30,536
Like so.

528
00:48:30,702 --> 00:48:35,624
<i>One, two, three.
Vera Verto.</i>

529
00:48:39,169 --> 00:48:43,090
Now it's your turn.
Who would like to go first?

530
00:48:43,674 --> 00:48:48,637
<i>Mr. Weasley.
"One, two, three. Vera Verto. "</i>

531
00:48:52,224 --> 00:48:54,309
<i>Vera Verto!</i>

532
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:03,110
That wand needs replacing,
Mr. Weasley.

533
00:49:04,444 --> 00:49:06,613
- Yes, Miss Granger?
- Professor...

534
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:10,993
...I was wondering if you could tell us
about the Chamber of Secrets.

535
00:49:17,166 --> 00:49:18,417
Very well.

536
00:49:19,918 --> 00:49:21,920
You all know, of course...

537
00:49:22,087 --> 00:49:25,966
...that Hogwarts was founded
over a thousand years ago...

538
00:49:26,133 --> 00:49:30,554
...by the four greatest witches
and wizards of the age:

539
00:49:30,721 --> 00:49:34,474
Godric Gryffindor,
Helga Hufflepuff...

540
00:49:34,641 --> 00:49:40,272
...Rowena Ravenclaw
and Salazar Slytherin.

541
00:49:40,939 --> 00:49:46,245
Now, three of the founders
coexisted quite harmoniously.

542
00:49:47,112 --> 00:49:50,157
- One did not.
- Three guesses who.

543
00:49:50,866 --> 00:49:53,327
Salazar Slytherin wished to be
more selective...

544
00:49:53,494 --> 00:49:56,663
...about the students admitted
to Hogwarts.

545
00:49:56,830 --> 00:50:01,418
He believed magical learning should
be kept within all-magic families.

546
00:50:01,585 --> 00:50:03,712
In other words, pure-bloods.

547
00:50:04,087 --> 00:50:09,426
Unable to sway the others,
he decided to leave the school.

548
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:12,513
Now, according to legend...

549
00:50:12,679 --> 00:50:16,391
...Slytherin had built
a hidden chamber in this castle...

550
00:50:16,558 --> 00:50:20,229
...known as the Chamber of Secrets.

551
00:50:20,395 --> 00:50:24,817
Though, shortly before departing,
he sealed it...

552
00:50:24,983 --> 00:50:29,112
...until that time when his own
true Heir returned to the school.

553
00:50:29,279 --> 00:50:31,657
The Heir alone...

554
00:50:31,824 --> 00:50:34,493
...would be able to open the Chamber...

555
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:39,414
...and unleash the horror within,
and by so doing...

556
00:50:39,581 --> 00:50:42,960
...purge the school
of all those who...

557
00:50:43,126 --> 00:50:48,131
...in Slytherin's view,
were unworthy to study magic.

558
00:50:48,757 --> 00:50:50,884
Muggle-borns.

559
00:50:51,927 --> 00:50:55,556
Naturally, the school
has been searched many times.

560
00:50:55,722 --> 00:50:59,184
No such chamber has been found.

561
00:50:59,768 --> 00:51:04,439
Professor? What exactly does legend
tell us lies within the Chamber?

562
00:51:05,274 --> 00:51:07,860
The Chamber is said to be home
to something...

563
00:51:08,026 --> 00:51:11,613
...that only the Heir of Slytherin
can control.

564
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:15,868
It is said to be the home...

565
00:51:16,034 --> 00:51:17,661
...of a monster.

566
00:51:23,417 --> 00:51:27,087
Do you think it's true? Do you think
there really is a Chamber of Secrets?

567
00:51:27,254 --> 00:51:31,466
Yes. Couldn't you tell? McGonagall's
worried. All the teachers are.

568
00:51:31,633 --> 00:51:35,470
If there really is a Chamber of Secrets,
and it has been opened, that means...

569
00:51:35,637 --> 00:51:39,600
The Heir of Slytherin has returned
to Hogwarts. The question is, who is it?

570
00:51:39,766 --> 00:51:44,146
Let's think. Who do we know who
thinks all Muggle-borns are scum?

571
00:51:44,313 --> 00:51:46,982
- Lf you're talking about Malfoy...
- Of course. You heard him.

572
00:51:47,149 --> 00:51:48,859
"You'll be next, Mudbloods. "

573
00:51:49,026 --> 00:51:51,653
I heard him.
But Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?

574
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:54,990
Maybe Ron's right, Hermione.
I mean, look at his family.

575
00:51:55,157 --> 00:51:57,951
The whole lot of them have been
in Slytherin for centuries.

576
00:51:58,118 --> 00:52:01,538
Crabbe and Goyle must know.
Maybe we could trick them into telling.

577
00:52:01,997 --> 00:52:06,168
Even they aren't that thick.
But there might be another way.

578
00:52:06,335 --> 00:52:08,170
Mind you, it would be difficult.

579
00:52:08,337 --> 00:52:11,381
Not to mention we'd be breaking
about 50 school rules...

580
00:52:11,548 --> 00:52:16,011
...and it'll be dangerous.
Very dangerous.

581
00:52:22,851 --> 00:52:25,312
Here it is.
The Polyjuice Potion.

582
00:52:25,479 --> 00:52:28,190
"Properly brewed, the Polyjuice Potion
allows the drinker...

583
00:52:28,357 --> 00:52:32,611
...to transform himself temporarily
into the physical form of another. "

584
00:52:32,778 --> 00:52:36,573
You mean if Harry and I drink that stuff,
we'll turn into Crabbe and Goyle?

585
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:40,118
- Wicked! Malfoy will tell us anything.
- Exactly.

586
00:52:40,285 --> 00:52:44,164
But it's tricky. I've never seen
a more complicated potion.

587
00:52:44,331 --> 00:52:47,417
- How long will it take to make?
- A month.

588
00:52:47,793 --> 00:52:49,253
A month?

589
00:52:49,419 --> 00:52:53,257
But, Hermione,
if Malfoy is the Heir of Slytherin...

590
00:52:53,423 --> 00:52:56,635
...he could attack half
the Muggle-borns in the school by then.

591
00:52:56,802 --> 00:52:58,720
I know.

592
00:52:58,887 --> 00:53:01,723
But it's the only plan we've got.

593
00:53:51,398 --> 00:53:54,109
Another goal for Slytherin!

594
00:53:55,527 --> 00:53:58,822
They lead Gryffindor 90 to 30.

595
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:01,575
Yeah!

596
00:54:01,825 --> 00:54:03,619
Yeah!

597
00:54:27,851 --> 00:54:30,187
All right there, Scarhead?

598
00:54:36,318 --> 00:54:38,821
Watch yourself, Harry!

599
00:54:39,196 --> 00:54:40,989
Wood, look out!

600
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:57,506
Blimey! Harry's got himself
a rogue Bludger.

601
00:54:57,673 --> 00:54:59,424
That's been tampered with, that has.

602
00:55:00,467 --> 00:55:01,510
I'll stop it.

603
00:55:01,677 --> 00:55:06,265
No! Even with a proper wand,
it's too risky. You could hit Harry.

604
00:55:31,331 --> 00:55:33,917
Training for the ballet, Potter?

605
00:56:04,907 --> 00:56:07,117
You'll never catch me, Potter.

606
00:57:37,916 --> 00:57:39,001
Let's go.

607
00:57:39,168 --> 00:57:44,381
<i>Harry Potter has caught the Snitch.
Gryffindor wins!</i>

608
00:57:50,679 --> 00:57:52,723
<i>Finite Incantatem!</i>

609
00:57:59,813 --> 00:58:01,148
- Thank you.
- Are you okay?

610
00:58:01,315 --> 00:58:03,400
No. I think my arm is broken.

611
00:58:03,567 --> 00:58:07,362
Not to worry, Harry. I will fix
that arm of yours straightaway.

612
00:58:07,529 --> 00:58:10,491
- Not you.
- Boy doesn't know what he's saying.

613
00:58:10,657 --> 00:58:14,203
This won't hurt a bit.

614
00:58:20,292 --> 00:58:23,295
<i>Brackium Emendo!</i>

615
00:58:31,345 --> 00:58:34,431
Yes, well,
that can sometimes happen...

616
00:58:34,598 --> 00:58:36,850
...but the point is...

617
00:58:38,227 --> 00:58:42,356
...you can no longer feel any pain, and,
very clearly, the bones are not broken.

618
00:58:42,523 --> 00:58:45,192
Broken? There's no bones left.

619
00:58:46,902 --> 00:58:48,862
Much more flexible, though.

620
00:58:51,323 --> 00:58:55,244
Mr. Malfoy, stop making such a fuss.
You can go. Out of my way.

621
00:58:55,410 --> 00:58:57,371
Should have been brought
straight to me.

622
00:58:57,538 --> 00:59:00,082
I can mend bones in a heartbeat,
but growing them back...

623
00:59:00,249 --> 00:59:01,750
You will be able to, won't you?

624
00:59:01,917 --> 00:59:05,045
I'll be able to, certainly.
But it'll be painful.

625
00:59:05,671 --> 00:59:10,342
You're in for a rough night, Potter.
Regrowing bones is a nasty business.

626
00:59:13,262 --> 00:59:16,265
What do you expect?
Pumpkin juice?

627
00:59:22,896 --> 00:59:24,648
<i>Kill.</i>

628
00:59:25,482 --> 00:59:27,025
<i>Kill.</i>

629
00:59:32,406 --> 00:59:35,617
<i>Time to kill.</i>

630
00:59:41,748 --> 00:59:42,791
Hello.

631
00:59:44,585 --> 00:59:45,627
Dobby?

632
00:59:45,794 --> 00:59:48,130
Harry Potter should have listened
to Dobby.

633
00:59:48,589 --> 00:59:52,301
Harry Potter should have gone back home
when he missed the train.

634
00:59:52,467 --> 00:59:57,097
It was you. You stopped the barrier
from letting Ron and me through.

635
00:59:57,389 --> 01:00:00,350
Indeed. Yes, sir.

636
01:00:01,351 --> 01:00:06,398
- You nearly got Ron and me expelled.
- At least you would be away from here.

637
01:00:06,565 --> 01:00:09,234
Harry Potter must go home.

638
01:00:09,401 --> 01:00:12,988
Dobby thought his Bludger would be
enough to make Harry Potter see...

639
01:00:13,155 --> 01:00:16,533
Your Bludger? You made
that Bludger chase after me?

640
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:20,287
Dobby feels most aggrieved, sir.

641
01:00:20,454 --> 01:00:24,082
Dobby had to iron his hands.

642
01:00:26,293 --> 01:00:30,881
You better clear off before my bones
come back, or I might strangle you.

643
01:00:33,509 --> 01:00:35,511
Dobby is used to death threats, sir.

644
01:00:35,677 --> 01:00:38,722
Dobby gets them five times a day
at home.

645
01:00:38,889 --> 01:00:41,683
I don't suppose you could tell me
why you're trying to kill me?

646
01:00:41,975 --> 01:00:45,854
Not kill you, sir.
Never kill you.

647
01:00:46,021 --> 01:00:49,358
Dobby remembers how it was
before Harry Potter triumphed...

648
01:00:49,525 --> 01:00:52,653
...over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.

649
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:56,532
We house-elves were
treated like vermin, sir.

650
01:00:56,698 --> 01:01:02,120
Of course, Dobby is still
treated like vermin.

651
01:01:11,463 --> 01:01:14,091
Why do you wear that thing, Dobby?

652
01:01:14,258 --> 01:01:19,388
This, sir? It is a mark
of the house-elf's enslavement.

653
01:01:19,555 --> 01:01:24,685
Dobby can only be freed if his master
presents him with clothes.

654
01:01:26,812 --> 01:01:28,188
Listen.

655
01:01:28,355 --> 01:01:29,898
Listen!

656
01:01:30,065 --> 01:01:33,777
Terrible things are
about to happen at Hogwarts.

657
01:01:34,403 --> 01:01:36,864
Harry Potter must not stay here...

658
01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:41,577
...now that history
is to repeat itself.

659
01:01:41,743 --> 01:01:45,205
Repeat itself? You mean
this has happened before?

660
01:01:45,372 --> 01:01:47,374
I shouldn't have said that.

661
01:01:51,086 --> 01:01:54,256
- Bad Dobby! Bad!
- Stop it!

662
01:01:54,423 --> 01:01:56,091
Stop it, Dobby!

663
01:01:57,759 --> 01:02:01,597
Tell me. When did this happen before?
Who's doing it now?

664
01:02:01,763 --> 01:02:06,977
Dobby cannot say, sir. Dobby
only wants Harry Potter to be safe.

665
01:02:07,144 --> 01:02:10,063
No, Dobby. Tell me.
Who is it?

666
01:02:21,909 --> 01:02:22,993
Put him here.

667
01:02:27,581 --> 01:02:30,501
- What happened?
- There's been another attack.

668
01:02:30,667 --> 01:02:36,465
I think he's been Petrified,
Madam Pomfrey.

669
01:02:37,257 --> 01:02:41,970
Look. Perhaps he managed
to take a picture of his attacker.

670
01:02:50,062 --> 01:02:52,815
What can this mean, Albus?

671
01:02:52,981 --> 01:02:54,942
It means...

672
01:02:55,317 --> 01:02:58,070
...that our students
are in great danger.

673
01:02:58,237 --> 01:03:01,657
- What should I tell the staff?
- The truth.

674
01:03:01,907 --> 01:03:05,702
Tell them Hogwarts
is no longer safe.

675
01:03:06,036 --> 01:03:08,997
It is as we feared, Minerva.

676
01:03:09,248 --> 01:03:13,794
The Chamber of Secrets
has indeed been opened again.

677
01:03:16,630 --> 01:03:20,759
Again? You mean the Chamber
of Secrets has been opened before?

678
01:03:20,926 --> 01:03:23,679
Of course.
Don't you see?

679
01:03:23,846 --> 01:03:26,849
Lucius Malfoy must have opened it
when he was at school here.

680
01:03:27,474 --> 01:03:30,060
- Now he's taught Draco how to do it.
- Maybe.

681
01:03:30,227 --> 01:03:33,397
We'll have to wait for
the Polyjuice Potion to know for sure.

682
01:03:33,564 --> 01:03:37,526
Enlighten me. Why are we brewing
this potion in broad daylight...

683
01:03:37,693 --> 01:03:41,655
...in the middle of the girls' lavatory?
Don't you think we'll get caught?

684
01:03:42,531 --> 01:03:45,200
No. No one ever comes in here.

685
01:03:46,034 --> 01:03:48,579
- Why?
- Moaning Myrtle.

686
01:03:48,745 --> 01:03:50,706
Who?

687
01:03:51,206 --> 01:03:52,875
Moaning Myrtle.

688
01:03:53,167 --> 01:03:56,503
- Who's Moaning Myrtle?
- I'm Moaning Myrtle.

689
01:04:02,426 --> 01:04:04,803
I wouldn't expect you to know me.

690
01:04:04,970 --> 01:04:08,015
Who would ever talk
about ugly, miserable...

691
01:04:08,182 --> 01:04:11,560
...moping Moaning Myrtle?

692
01:04:18,775 --> 01:04:20,903
She's a little sensitive.

693
01:04:25,407 --> 01:04:27,367
Gather round!

694
01:04:27,701 --> 01:04:32,706
Gather round.
Can everybody see me?

695
01:04:32,873 --> 01:04:36,001
Can you all hear me?

696
01:04:36,668 --> 01:04:38,003
Excellent.

697
01:04:38,504 --> 01:04:42,216
In light of the dark events
of recent weeks...

698
01:04:42,382 --> 01:04:47,054
...Professor Dumbledore has granted me
permission to start this Dueling Club...

699
01:04:47,221 --> 01:04:51,892
...to train you all up in case
you ever need to defend yourselves...

700
01:04:52,142 --> 01:04:54,686
...as I myself have done
on countless occasions.

701
01:04:54,895 --> 01:04:58,565
For full details,
see my published works.

702
01:05:03,278 --> 01:05:06,406
Let me introduce my assistant...

703
01:05:06,573 --> 01:05:09,201
...Professor Snape.

704
01:05:12,538 --> 01:05:15,332
He has sportingly agreed to help
with a short demonstration.

705
01:05:15,499 --> 01:05:17,543
I don't want any of you
youngsters to worry.

706
01:05:17,709 --> 01:05:22,631
You'll still have your Potions master
when I'm through with him. Never fear.

707
01:05:38,272 --> 01:05:39,898
One.

708
01:05:40,065 --> 01:05:41,108
Two.

709
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:44,945
<i>- Three!
- Expelliarmus!</i>

710
01:05:53,537 --> 01:05:56,206
- Do you think he's all right?
- Who cares?

711
01:05:56,373 --> 01:05:59,334
An excellent idea to show them that,
Professor Snape...

712
01:05:59,501 --> 01:06:04,047
...but if you don't mind me saying, it was
obvious what you were about to do.

713
01:06:04,214 --> 01:06:07,467
If I had wanted to stop you,
it would have been only too easy.

714
01:06:07,634 --> 01:06:11,096
Perhaps it would be prudent
to first teach the students...

715
01:06:11,263 --> 01:06:15,767
...to block unfriendly spells,
professor.

716
01:06:17,519 --> 01:06:19,938
An excellent suggestion,
Professor Snape.

717
01:06:21,190 --> 01:06:25,444
Let's have a volunteer pair.
Potter, Weasley, how about you?

718
01:06:25,611 --> 01:06:29,114
Weasley's wand causes devastation
with the simplest spells.

719
01:06:29,531 --> 01:06:33,243
We'll be sending Potter
to the hospital wing in a matchbox.

720
01:06:33,410 --> 01:06:37,498
Might I suggest someone
from my own house?

721
01:06:38,749 --> 01:06:41,251
Malfoy, perhaps?

722
01:06:48,759 --> 01:06:51,261
- Good luck, Potter.
- Thank you, sir.

723
01:06:59,228 --> 01:07:01,230
Wands at the ready.

724
01:07:01,814 --> 01:07:04,817
- Scared, Potter?
- You wish.

725
01:07:15,244 --> 01:07:16,954
On the count of three...

726
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:21,458
...cast your charms to disarm
your opponent. Only to disarm.

727
01:07:21,625 --> 01:07:25,170
We don't want any accidents here.
One.

728
01:07:26,964 --> 01:07:29,508
<i>- Two.
- Everte Statum!</i>

729
01:07:41,145 --> 01:07:43,397
<i>Rictusempra!</i>

730
01:07:54,366 --> 01:07:56,160
I said disarm only.

731
01:07:56,326 --> 01:07:58,328
<i>Serpensortia!</i>

732
01:08:07,004 --> 01:08:09,798
Don't move, Potter.
I'll get rid of it for you.

733
01:08:09,965 --> 01:08:15,387
<i>Allow me, Professor Snape.
Alarte Ascendare!</i>

734
01:08:57,930 --> 01:09:00,599
<i>Vipera Evanesca.</i>

735
01:09:07,314 --> 01:09:09,691
What are you playing at?

736
01:09:22,454 --> 01:09:25,165
You're a Parselmouth?
Why didn't you tell us?

737
01:09:25,332 --> 01:09:27,584
- I'm a what?
- You can talk to snakes.

738
01:09:27,751 --> 01:09:33,090
I know. I accidentally set a python
on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once.

739
01:09:33,257 --> 01:09:37,219
Once. But so what?
I bet loads of people here can do it.

740
01:09:37,386 --> 01:09:41,140
No, they can't.
It's not a very common gift, Harry.

741
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:43,350
This is bad.

742
01:09:43,517 --> 01:09:47,271
What's bad? If I hadn't told
that snake not to attack Justin...

743
01:09:47,437 --> 01:09:50,899
- That's what you said to it.
- You were there. You heard me.

744
01:09:51,066 --> 01:09:54,945
I heard you speaking Parseltongue.
Snake language.

745
01:09:55,112 --> 01:09:57,990
I spoke a different language?

746
01:09:59,074 --> 01:10:01,451
But I didn't realize...

747
01:10:01,618 --> 01:10:04,413
How can I speak a language
without knowing I can?

748
01:10:04,580 --> 01:10:08,584
I don't know, but it sounded like you
were egging the snake on or something.

749
01:10:08,750 --> 01:10:10,460
Harry, listen to me.

750
01:10:10,878 --> 01:10:13,755
There's a reason the symbol
of Slytherin house is a serpent.

751
01:10:13,922 --> 01:10:18,427
Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth.
He could talk to snakes too.

752
01:10:18,677 --> 01:10:19,720
Exactly.

753
01:10:19,887 --> 01:10:23,265
Now the whole school's gonna think
you're his great-great-great grandson.

754
01:10:23,432 --> 01:10:25,434
But I'm not.

755
01:10:28,145 --> 01:10:30,105
I can't be.

756
01:10:31,231 --> 01:10:33,275
He lived a thousand years ago.

757
01:10:33,442 --> 01:10:36,653
For all we know, you could be.

758
01:11:06,767 --> 01:11:09,144
I'll see you back in the common room.

759
01:11:25,536 --> 01:11:29,832
<i>I want blood.</i>

760
01:11:32,709 --> 01:11:37,714
<i>They all must die.</i>

761
01:11:38,298 --> 01:11:40,300
<i>Kill.</i>

762
01:11:40,968 --> 01:11:43,053
<i>Kill.</i>

763
01:11:43,846 --> 01:11:46,140
<i>Kill.</i>

764
01:11:46,473 --> 01:11:50,519
<i>Time to kill.</i>

765
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:26,638
Caught in the act.

766
01:12:26,805 --> 01:12:28,765
I'll have you out this time, Potter.

767
01:12:29,266 --> 01:12:31,768
Mark my words.

768
01:12:31,935 --> 01:12:36,190
No. Mr. Filch! You don't understand...

769
01:13:02,925 --> 01:13:04,885
Professor...

770
01:13:05,052 --> 01:13:06,428
...I swear I didn't.

771
01:13:06,637 --> 01:13:09,848
This is out of my hands, Potter.

772
01:13:19,483 --> 01:13:22,152
Professor Dumbledore
will be waiting for you.

773
01:13:31,078 --> 01:13:33,664
Sherbet Lemon.

774
01:14:07,614 --> 01:14:09,741
Professor Dumbledore?

775
01:14:26,216 --> 01:14:28,927
Bee in your bonnet, Potter?

776
01:14:31,805 --> 01:14:36,351
I was just wondering
if you put me in the right house.

777
01:14:36,518 --> 01:14:41,982
Yes. You were particularly
difficult to place.

778
01:14:42,149 --> 01:14:45,694
But I stand by what I said last year.

779
01:14:45,861 --> 01:14:49,239
You would have done well in Slytherin.

780
01:14:49,406 --> 01:14:50,741
You're wrong.

781
01:15:20,020 --> 01:15:21,438
Harry?

782
01:15:21,814 --> 01:15:24,066
Professor.

783
01:15:24,233 --> 01:15:28,028
Your bird...
There was nothing I could do.

784
01:15:28,612 --> 01:15:31,949
- He just caught fire.
- And about time too.

785
01:15:32,783 --> 01:15:35,118
He's been looking dreadful for days.

786
01:15:35,285 --> 01:15:37,287
Pity you had to see him
on a burning day.

787
01:15:39,206 --> 01:15:42,459
Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry.

788
01:15:42,626 --> 01:15:45,963
They burst into flame
when it is time for them to die...

789
01:15:46,129 --> 01:15:48,257
...and then they are...

790
01:15:48,423 --> 01:15:51,468
...reborn from the ashes.

791
01:15:59,852 --> 01:16:02,479
Fascinating creatures, phoenixes.

792
01:16:02,938 --> 01:16:06,817
They can carry immensely heavy loads.

793
01:16:06,984 --> 01:16:09,820
Their tears have healing powers.

794
01:16:12,447 --> 01:16:15,492
Professor Dumbledore, sir!
Wait! Listen!

795
01:16:16,493 --> 01:16:18,620
Professor Dumbledore, sir,
it wasn't Harry.

796
01:16:19,788 --> 01:16:22,666
I'd be prepared to swear it
in front of the Ministry of Magic.

797
01:16:24,126 --> 01:16:26,003
Relax.

798
01:16:26,753 --> 01:16:28,714
I do not believe...

799
01:16:28,881 --> 01:16:32,384
...that Harry attacked anyone.
- Of course you don't.

800
01:16:36,138 --> 01:16:38,724
Right. Well, I'II...

801
01:16:38,891 --> 01:16:42,019
- I'll just wait outside, then.
- Yes.

802
01:16:45,689 --> 01:16:49,359
- You don't think it was me, professor?
- No, Harry.

803
01:16:49,526 --> 01:16:52,029
I do not think it was you.

804
01:16:53,071 --> 01:16:54,865
But I must ask you...

805
01:16:55,449 --> 01:16:59,536
...is there something
you wish to tell me?

806
01:17:06,001 --> 01:17:07,920
No, sir.

807
01:17:08,086 --> 01:17:09,588
Nothing.

808
01:17:12,591 --> 01:17:14,760
Very well, then.

809
01:17:14,927 --> 01:17:16,720
Off you go.

810
01:17:54,675 --> 01:17:58,220
Everything's set. We just need a bit
of who you're changing into.

811
01:17:58,387 --> 01:18:00,097
Crabbe and Goyle.

812
01:18:00,264 --> 01:18:03,058
We also need to make sure
that the real Crabbe and Goyle...

813
01:18:03,225 --> 01:18:06,436
...can't burst in on us
while we're interrogating Malfoy.

814
01:18:06,770 --> 01:18:09,481
- How?
- I've got it all worked out.

815
01:18:09,648 --> 01:18:12,234
I filled these
with a simple Sleeping Draught.

816
01:18:12,401 --> 01:18:15,154
Simple, but powerful.

817
01:18:15,362 --> 01:18:17,531
Now, once they're asleep...

818
01:18:17,698 --> 01:18:20,909
...hide them in the broomstick cupboard
and pull out a few of their hairs...

819
01:18:21,076 --> 01:18:22,953
...and put on their uniforms.

820
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:26,415
- Whose hair are you ripping out, then?
- I've already got mine.

821
01:18:26,582 --> 01:18:29,751
Millicent Bulstrode. Slytherin.

822
01:18:29,918 --> 01:18:32,087
I got this off her robes.

823
01:18:32,254 --> 01:18:34,882
I'm going to go check
on the Polyjuice Potion.

824
01:18:35,048 --> 01:18:37,759
Make sure that Crabbe and Goyle
find these.

825
01:18:49,897 --> 01:18:52,274
Ron, maybe I should do it.

826
01:18:52,441 --> 01:18:54,485
Yeah. Right.

827
01:18:56,695 --> 01:18:58,530
<i>Wingardium Leviosa.</i>

828
01:19:08,665 --> 01:19:10,292
Cool.

829
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:35,275
How thick could you get?

830
01:19:35,442 --> 01:19:37,402
Come on, let's get them.

831
01:19:40,072 --> 01:19:44,076
We'll have exactly one hour
before we change back into ourselves.

832
01:19:52,251 --> 01:19:54,211
Add the hairs.

833
01:19:58,757 --> 01:20:00,509
Essence of Crabbe.

834
01:20:00,676 --> 01:20:02,553
Cheers.

835
01:20:11,270 --> 01:20:13,689
I think I'm gonna be sick.

836
01:20:16,608 --> 01:20:18,443
Me too.

837
01:21:03,322 --> 01:21:05,073
Harry?

838
01:21:05,532 --> 01:21:07,075
Ron.

839
01:21:07,826 --> 01:21:09,995
Bloody hell!

840
01:21:10,787 --> 01:21:13,081
We still sound like ourselves.

841
01:21:13,248 --> 01:21:15,000
You need to sound more like Crabbe.

842
01:21:16,168 --> 01:21:18,462
- Bloody hell.
- Excellent.

843
01:21:18,795 --> 01:21:21,298
- But where's Hermione?
- I...

844
01:21:21,465 --> 01:21:24,468
I don't think I'm going.
You go on without me.

845
01:21:24,635 --> 01:21:26,345
Hermione, are you okay?

846
01:21:26,512 --> 01:21:29,348
Just go. You're wasting time.

847
01:21:31,433 --> 01:21:33,101
Come on.

848
01:21:36,605 --> 01:21:39,942
I think the Slytherin common room's
this way.

849
01:21:42,945 --> 01:21:45,405
Excuse me.

850
01:21:47,199 --> 01:21:49,117
What are you doing d...?

851
01:21:49,284 --> 01:21:51,370
I mean, what are you doing down here?

852
01:21:53,288 --> 01:21:55,999
I happen to be a school prefect.

853
01:21:56,166 --> 01:22:00,629
You, on the other hand, have no business
wandering the corridors at night.

854
01:22:01,213 --> 01:22:03,048
What are your names again?

855
01:22:03,215 --> 01:22:07,219
- I'm...
- Crabbe, Goyle, where have you been?

856
01:22:07,386 --> 01:22:10,430
Pigging out in the Great Hall
all this time?

857
01:22:11,932 --> 01:22:14,226
Why are you wearing glasses?

858
01:22:15,060 --> 01:22:17,896
- Reading.
- Reading?

859
01:22:19,064 --> 01:22:21,358
I didn't know you could read.

860
01:22:24,236 --> 01:22:26,321
And what are you doing down here,
Weasley?

861
01:22:26,488 --> 01:22:28,532
Mind your attitude, Malfoy.

862
01:22:37,332 --> 01:22:39,334
Well, sit down.

863
01:22:42,129 --> 01:22:45,966
You'd never know the Weasleys
were pure-bloods, the way they behave.

864
01:22:46,175 --> 01:22:50,012
They're an embarrassment
to the wizarding world. All of them.

865
01:22:50,846 --> 01:22:53,140
What's wrong with you, Crabbe?

866
01:22:55,350 --> 01:22:57,102
Stomachache.

867
01:22:59,104 --> 01:23:03,942
<i>I'm surprised the Daily Prophet
hasn't done a report on all these attacks.</i>

868
01:23:04,109 --> 01:23:06,570
I suppose Dumbledore
is trying to hush it all up.

869
01:23:06,862 --> 01:23:09,239
Father always said Dumbledore
was the worst thing...

870
01:23:09,406 --> 01:23:13,202
...that ever happened to this place.
- You're wrong!

871
01:23:20,709 --> 01:23:21,877
What?

872
01:23:22,044 --> 01:23:25,714
You think there's someone here
who's worse than Dumbledore?

873
01:23:25,881 --> 01:23:28,300
Well? Do you?

874
01:23:28,842 --> 01:23:30,719
Harry Potter?

875
01:23:37,267 --> 01:23:38,685
Good one, Goyle.

876
01:23:38,852 --> 01:23:40,395
You're absolutely right.

877
01:23:41,063 --> 01:23:42,898
Saint Potter.

878
01:23:43,899 --> 01:23:46,693
And people actually think
that he's the Heir of Slytherin?

879
01:23:50,447 --> 01:23:53,075
But then you must have some idea
who's behind it all.

880
01:23:53,242 --> 01:23:56,912
You know I don't, Goyle.
I told you yesterday.

881
01:23:57,913 --> 01:24:00,415
How many times do I have to tell you?

882
01:24:01,416 --> 01:24:03,252
Is this yours?

883
01:24:07,714 --> 01:24:10,092
But my father did say this:

884
01:24:10,467 --> 01:24:13,387
It's been 50 years
since the Chamber was opened.

885
01:24:13,554 --> 01:24:17,933
He wouldn't tell me who opened it.
Only that they were expelled.

886
01:24:18,225 --> 01:24:22,896
The last time the Chamber of Secrets
was opened, a Mudblood died.

887
01:24:23,063 --> 01:24:27,359
So it's only a matter of time
before one of them is killed this time.

888
01:24:27,943 --> 01:24:29,778
As for me...

889
01:24:29,945 --> 01:24:32,114
...I hope it's Granger.

890
01:24:32,281 --> 01:24:34,491
What's the matter with you two?

891
01:24:34,658 --> 01:24:37,161
You're acting very odd.

892
01:24:37,327 --> 01:24:39,538
It's his stomachache.

893
01:24:39,705 --> 01:24:41,790
Calm down.

894
01:24:45,961 --> 01:24:47,963
Scar.

895
01:24:51,550 --> 01:24:52,968
Hair.

896
01:24:59,141 --> 01:25:01,518
Hey! Where are you going?

897
01:25:04,521 --> 01:25:05,814
That was close.

898
01:25:05,981 --> 01:25:08,400
Hermione, come out.
We've got loads to tell you.

899
01:25:08,567 --> 01:25:10,444
Go away.

900
01:25:10,944 --> 01:25:14,823
Wait till you see. It's awful.

901
01:25:16,783 --> 01:25:18,535
Hermione?

902
01:25:18,702 --> 01:25:20,329
Are you okay?

903
01:25:22,372 --> 01:25:24,166
Do you remember me telling you...

904
01:25:24,333 --> 01:25:27,503
...that the Polyjuice Potion
was only for human transformations?

905
01:25:27,669 --> 01:25:31,799
It was cat hair I plucked off
Millicent Bulstrode's robes.

906
01:25:34,176 --> 01:25:35,719
Look at my face.

907
01:25:36,845 --> 01:25:39,306
Look at your tail.

908
01:25:45,854 --> 01:25:47,314
Have you spoken to Hermione?

909
01:25:47,481 --> 01:25:50,025
She should be out of hospital
in a few days...

910
01:25:50,192 --> 01:25:53,028
...when she stops coughing up fur balls.

911
01:25:57,783 --> 01:25:59,535
What's this?

912
01:26:04,122 --> 01:26:05,207
Yuck!

913
01:26:05,374 --> 01:26:08,168
Looks like Moaning Myrtle's
flooded the bathroom.

914
01:26:24,393 --> 01:26:28,522
- Come to throw something else at me?
- Why would I throw something at you?

915
01:26:28,939 --> 01:26:33,026
Don't ask me. Here I am,
minding my own business...

916
01:26:33,193 --> 01:26:36,822
...and someone thinks it's funny
to throw a book at me.

917
01:26:37,030 --> 01:26:39,908
But it can't hurt if someone
throws something at you.

918
01:26:40,075 --> 01:26:42,494
I mean, it'll just go
right through you.

919
01:26:43,537 --> 01:26:47,916
Sure! Let's all throw books at Myrtle
because she can't feel it.

920
01:26:48,083 --> 01:26:50,711
Ten points
if you get it through her stomach!

921
01:26:50,878 --> 01:26:54,381
Fifty points if it goes through her head!

922
01:26:54,882 --> 01:26:59,303
- But who threw it at you, anyway?
- I don't know. I didn't see them.

923
01:26:59,636 --> 01:27:03,891
I was just sitting in the U-bend,
thinking about death...

924
01:27:04,099 --> 01:27:07,769
...and it fell through the top
of my head.

925
01:27:37,925 --> 01:27:40,427
"Tom Marvolo Riddle. "

926
01:28:10,290 --> 01:28:12,626
My name...

927
01:28:12,793 --> 01:28:15,712
...is Harry...

928
01:28:17,339 --> 01:28:19,466
...Potter.

929
01:28:32,688 --> 01:28:37,860
Do you know anything...

930
01:28:38,694 --> 01:28:44,367
...about the Chamber of Secrets?

931
01:28:55,502 --> 01:28:57,421
Can you...

932
01:28:58,672 --> 01:29:00,966
...tell me?

933
01:30:03,237 --> 01:30:06,657
Excuse me. Could you tell me
what's going on here?

934
01:30:10,118 --> 01:30:12,454
Are you Tom Riddle?

935
01:30:12,621 --> 01:30:14,414
Hello, can you hear me?

936
01:30:34,977 --> 01:30:36,728
Riddle!

937
01:30:37,312 --> 01:30:38,856
Come.

938
01:30:39,022 --> 01:30:41,024
Professor Dumbledore.

939
01:30:43,193 --> 01:30:45,362
Dumbledore?

940
01:30:46,655 --> 01:30:50,159
It is not wise to be wandering around
this late hour, Tom.

941
01:30:50,325 --> 01:30:53,662
Yes, professor. I suppose I...

942
01:30:53,829 --> 01:30:55,998
I had to see for myself
if the rumors were true.

943
01:30:56,582 --> 01:30:59,501
I'm afraid they are, Tom.
They are true.

944
01:30:59,668 --> 01:31:02,504
About the school as well?
I don't have a home to go to.

945
01:31:02,671 --> 01:31:05,507
They wouldn't really close Hogwarts,
would they, professor?

946
01:31:05,674 --> 01:31:08,218
I understand, Tom, but I'm afraid...

947
01:31:09,011 --> 01:31:11,930
...Headmaster Dippet
may have no choice.

948
01:31:12,097 --> 01:31:16,602
Sir, if it all stopped,
if the person responsible was caught...

949
01:31:18,854 --> 01:31:20,981
Is there something...

950
01:31:21,899 --> 01:31:23,901
...you wish to tell me?

951
01:31:25,110 --> 01:31:27,654
No, sir. Nothing.

952
01:31:34,411 --> 01:31:37,456
Very well, then. Off you go.

953
01:31:37,623 --> 01:31:39,500
Good night, sir.

954
01:32:15,619 --> 01:32:18,539
- Let's get you out of there.
- Evening, Hagrid.

955
01:32:18,872 --> 01:32:23,210
I'm going to have to turn you in. I don't
think you meant it to kill anyone...

956
01:32:23,377 --> 01:32:25,671
You can't. You don't understand.

957
01:32:25,879 --> 01:32:29,007
The dead girl's parents will be here
tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do...

958
01:32:29,174 --> 01:32:32,094
...is make sure the thing that killed
their daughter is slaughtered.

959
01:32:32,344 --> 01:32:35,472
It wasn't him.
Aragog never killed no one. Never.

960
01:32:35,806 --> 01:32:37,975
Monsters don't make good pets, Hagrid.

961
01:32:38,142 --> 01:32:39,768
- Now, stand aside.
- No!

962
01:32:39,935 --> 01:32:41,895
- Stand aside, Hagrid.
- No!

963
01:32:42,062 --> 01:32:43,689
<i>Cistem Aperio!</i>

964
01:32:50,654 --> 01:32:52,990
<i>Arania Exumai!</i>

965
01:32:53,866 --> 01:32:55,325
Aragog!

966
01:32:55,492 --> 01:32:56,743
Aragog!

967
01:32:57,286 --> 01:32:58,662
I can't let you go.

968
01:32:59,204 --> 01:33:02,499
They'll have your wand for this, Hagrid.
You'll be expelled.

969
01:33:05,043 --> 01:33:06,920
Hagrid!

970
01:33:36,950 --> 01:33:41,079
It was Hagrid. Hagrid opened
the Chamber of Secrets 50 years ago.

971
01:33:41,246 --> 01:33:44,208
It can't be Hagrid.
It just can't be.

972
01:33:44,374 --> 01:33:48,462
We don't even know this Tom Riddle.
He sounds like a dirty, rotten snitch.

973
01:33:48,629 --> 01:33:52,132
The monster had killed somebody, Ron.
What would any of us have done?

974
01:33:52,424 --> 01:33:56,386
Look, Hagrid's our friend. Why don't
we just go and ask him about it?

975
01:33:56,595 --> 01:33:59,264
That would be a cheerful visit.
"Hello, Hagrid.

976
01:33:59,431 --> 01:34:03,268
Tell us, have you been setting anything
mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?"

977
01:34:03,435 --> 01:34:06,647
Mad and hairy? You wouldn't be talking
about me, now, would you?

978
01:34:06,939 --> 01:34:07,981
No.

979
01:34:12,486 --> 01:34:14,112
What's that you've got, Hagrid?

980
01:34:14,571 --> 01:34:19,117
It's Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent.
For the Mandrakes, you know.

981
01:34:19,284 --> 01:34:22,955
Now, according to Professor Sprout,
they've still got a bit of growing to do.

982
01:34:23,121 --> 01:34:26,625
But once their acne's cleared up,
we'll chop them up and stew them...

983
01:34:26,792 --> 01:34:30,087
...and then we'll get those people
down at the hospital un-Petrified.

984
01:34:31,547 --> 01:34:34,424
In the meantime, though, you three...

985
01:34:34,591 --> 01:34:37,761
...had best be looking after yourselves.
All right?

986
01:34:45,644 --> 01:34:47,563
Hello, Neville.

987
01:34:48,647 --> 01:34:51,150
Harry, I don't know who did it,
but you'd better come.

988
01:34:51,525 --> 01:34:53,235
Come on!

989
01:35:15,799 --> 01:35:19,803
It had to be a Gryffindor.
Nobody else knows our password.

990
01:35:19,970 --> 01:35:22,222
Unless it wasn't a student.

991
01:35:22,389 --> 01:35:25,809
Whoever it was, they must have
been looking for something.

992
01:35:25,976 --> 01:35:27,394
And they found it.

993
01:35:28,145 --> 01:35:30,647
Tom Riddle's diary is gone.

994
01:35:32,232 --> 01:35:33,525
All right, listen up.

995
01:35:33,692 --> 01:35:36,612
We play our game,
Hufflepuff doesn't stand a chance.

996
01:35:36,778 --> 01:35:38,655
We're stronger, quicker and smarter.

997
01:35:38,822 --> 01:35:41,825
Not to mention they're dead scared
that Harry will Petrify them...

998
01:35:41,992 --> 01:35:45,496
...if they fly anywhere near him.
- Well, that too.

999
01:35:46,705 --> 01:35:48,248
Professor McGonagall.

1000
01:35:48,415 --> 01:35:51,460
- This match has been canceled.
- We can't cancel Quidditch.

1001
01:35:51,627 --> 01:35:56,590
Silence, Wood. You and your teammates
will go to Gryffindor Tower. Now.

1002
01:35:56,757 --> 01:35:59,426
Potter, you and I will find Mr. Weasley.

1003
01:35:59,802 --> 01:36:02,346
There's something
the both of you have to see.

1004
01:36:04,431 --> 01:36:08,018
I warn you.
This could be a wee bit of a shock.

1005
01:36:16,401 --> 01:36:17,611
Hermione!

1006
01:36:17,778 --> 01:36:19,571
She was found near the library...

1007
01:36:20,823 --> 01:36:22,866
...along with this.

1008
01:36:24,326 --> 01:36:27,162
Does it mean anything to either of you?

1009
01:36:27,329 --> 01:36:28,789
No.

1010
01:36:43,011 --> 01:36:45,347
Could I have your attention, please?

1011
01:36:45,514 --> 01:36:51,145
Because of recent events, these new
rules will be put into effect immediately:

1012
01:36:51,478 --> 01:36:56,608
"All students will return to their house
common rooms by 6:00 every evening.

1013
01:36:56,775 --> 01:37:00,863
All students will be escorted
to each lesson by a teacher.

1014
01:37:01,029 --> 01:37:04,032
No exceptions. "

1015
01:37:04,700 --> 01:37:06,743
I should tell you this:

1016
01:37:06,910 --> 01:37:11,039
Unless the culprit
behind these attacks is caught...

1017
01:37:11,582 --> 01:37:14,751
...it is likely the school will be closed.

1018
01:37:26,263 --> 01:37:29,224
We've got to talk to Hagrid, Ron.
I can't believe it's him...

1019
01:37:29,391 --> 01:37:31,685
...but if he did set the monster loose
last time...

1020
01:37:31,852 --> 01:37:35,022
...he'll know how to get inside
the Chamber of Secrets. That's a start.

1021
01:37:35,189 --> 01:37:36,440
But you heard McGonagall.

1022
01:37:36,607 --> 01:37:39,902
We're not allowed to leave
the tower except for class.

1023
01:37:40,360 --> 01:37:42,821
I think it's time to get
my dad's old cloak out again.

1024
01:37:56,460 --> 01:37:58,170
Who's there?

1025
01:38:01,965 --> 01:38:03,550
Hello?

1026
01:38:04,176 --> 01:38:05,719
Hello?

1027
01:38:06,887 --> 01:38:11,183
- What's that for?
- Nothing. I was expecting...

1028
01:38:11,350 --> 01:38:15,229
It doesn't matter. Come on in.
I just made a pot of tea.

1029
01:38:17,981 --> 01:38:20,275
Hagrid, are you okay?

1030
01:38:20,442 --> 01:38:23,320
I'm fine. I'm all right.

1031
01:38:24,279 --> 01:38:25,989
Did you hear about Hermione?

1032
01:38:26,490 --> 01:38:30,160
Yeah. I heard about that, all right.

1033
01:38:30,494 --> 01:38:34,164
Look, we have to ask you something.

1034
01:38:35,833 --> 01:38:39,336
Do you know who's opened
the Chamber of Secrets?

1035
01:38:41,672 --> 01:38:43,966
What you had to understand
about that is...

1036
01:38:45,634 --> 01:38:47,219
Quick, under the cloak.

1037
01:38:47,886 --> 01:38:50,973
Don't say a word.
Be quiet, both of you.

1038
01:38:57,396 --> 01:39:00,482
- Professor Dumbledore, sir.
- Good evening, Hagrid.

1039
01:39:00,649 --> 01:39:03,068
I wonder, could we...?

1040
01:39:03,235 --> 01:39:05,737
Of course. Come in. Come in.

1041
01:39:05,904 --> 01:39:07,281
That's Dad's boss.

1042
01:39:07,447 --> 01:39:11,034
Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic.

1043
01:39:11,201 --> 01:39:15,581
Bad business, Hagrid, very bad business.
Had to come.

1044
01:39:15,747 --> 01:39:19,001
Three attacks on Muggle-borns.
Things have gone far enough.

1045
01:39:19,168 --> 01:39:22,379
- The Ministry's got to act.
- But I never...

1046
01:39:22,588 --> 01:39:24,381
You know I never, professor.

1047
01:39:24,548 --> 01:39:27,634
I want it understood, Cornelius...

1048
01:39:27,801 --> 01:39:29,636
...that Hagrid...

1049
01:39:29,803 --> 01:39:32,097
...has my full confidence.

1050
01:39:32,264 --> 01:39:36,059
Albus, look,
Hagrid's record is against him.

1051
01:39:36,226 --> 01:39:38,770
- I've got to take him.
- Take me?

1052
01:39:38,937 --> 01:39:41,231
Take me where?
Not Azkaban prison.

1053
01:39:41,523 --> 01:39:45,277
I'm afraid we have no choice, Hagrid.

1054
01:39:45,903 --> 01:39:47,821
Already here, Fudge?

1055
01:39:47,988 --> 01:39:49,323
Good.

1056
01:39:50,240 --> 01:39:52,993
What are you doing here?
Get out of my house!

1057
01:39:53,660 --> 01:39:55,204
Believe me...

1058
01:39:55,496 --> 01:39:59,708
...I take absolutely no pleasure
being inside your...

1059
01:40:01,585 --> 01:40:03,796
You call this a house?

1060
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:05,923
No.

1061
01:40:06,089 --> 01:40:09,968
I simply called up the school
and was told the headmaster was here.

1062
01:40:10,135 --> 01:40:14,223
Well, what exactly is it
that you want with me?

1063
01:40:14,765 --> 01:40:19,520
The other governors and I have decided
it's time for you to step aside.

1064
01:40:21,146 --> 01:40:24,066
This is an order of suspension.

1065
01:40:29,613 --> 01:40:32,991
You'll find all 12 signatures on it.

1066
01:40:36,870 --> 01:40:41,083
I'm afraid we feel
you've rather lost your touch.

1067
01:40:41,792 --> 01:40:44,128
Well, what, with all these attacks...

1068
01:40:44,294 --> 01:40:47,089
...there'll be no
Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts.

1069
01:40:47,256 --> 01:40:51,802
I can only imagine what an awful loss
that would be to the school.

1070
01:40:51,969 --> 01:40:54,179
You can't take
Professor Dumbledore away.

1071
01:40:54,471 --> 01:40:57,015
Take him away and the Muggle-borns
won't stand a chance.

1072
01:40:57,182 --> 01:40:59,643
You mark my words,
there'll be killings next!

1073
01:40:59,810 --> 01:41:01,478
You think so?

1074
01:41:01,645 --> 01:41:04,148
Calm yourself, Hagrid.

1075
01:41:05,482 --> 01:41:08,235
If the governors desire my removal...

1076
01:41:08,402 --> 01:41:12,114
...I will, of course, step aside.

1077
01:41:13,699 --> 01:41:15,951
However...

1078
01:41:16,618 --> 01:41:21,165
...you will find that help
will always be given at Hogwarts...

1079
01:41:21,331 --> 01:41:23,208
...to those who...

1080
01:41:23,375 --> 01:41:25,711
...ask for it.

1081
01:41:32,509 --> 01:41:34,845
Admirable sentiments.

1082
01:41:35,012 --> 01:41:36,847
Shall we?

1083
01:41:48,942 --> 01:41:50,486
Fudge.

1084
01:41:52,196 --> 01:41:54,031
Come, Hagrid.

1085
01:41:55,157 --> 01:41:56,700
Well?

1086
01:41:57,367 --> 01:41:58,452
Lf...

1087
01:41:58,869 --> 01:42:01,413
If anybody was looking for some stuff...

1088
01:42:01,580 --> 01:42:06,460
...then all they'd have to do
would be to follow the spiders.

1089
01:42:06,627 --> 01:42:09,213
Yep. That would lead them right.

1090
01:42:09,379 --> 01:42:11,340
That's all I have to say.

1091
01:42:13,050 --> 01:42:16,804
And someone will need
to feed Fang while I'm away.

1092
01:42:20,182 --> 01:42:22,184
Good boy.

1093
01:42:28,315 --> 01:42:30,442
Hagrid's right.

1094
01:42:30,609 --> 01:42:33,570
With Dumbledore gone,
there'll be an attack a day.

1095
01:42:33,737 --> 01:42:35,405
Look.

1096
01:42:41,453 --> 01:42:43,247
Come on.

1097
01:42:46,959 --> 01:42:49,002
Come on, Fang.

1098
01:43:07,271 --> 01:43:08,647
Come on.

1099
01:43:08,814 --> 01:43:10,107
What?

1100
01:43:10,274 --> 01:43:13,527
You heard what Hagrid said.
"Follow the spiders. "

1101
01:43:13,735 --> 01:43:16,363
They're heading to the Dark Forest.

1102
01:43:18,407 --> 01:43:22,870
Why spiders? Why couldn't it be
"follow the butterflies"?

1103
01:43:58,614 --> 01:44:01,366
Harry, I don't like this.

1104
01:44:06,497 --> 01:44:09,708
- Harry, I don't like this at all.
- Shush!

1105
01:44:21,220 --> 01:44:23,764
Can we go back now?

1106
01:44:23,931 --> 01:44:25,682
Come on.

1107
01:45:15,399 --> 01:45:18,152
Who is it?

1108
01:45:18,819 --> 01:45:19,945
Don't panic.

1109
01:45:20,279 --> 01:45:21,780
Hagrid?

1110
01:45:22,197 --> 01:45:23,782
Is that you?

1111
01:45:24,366 --> 01:45:26,285
We're friends of Hagrid's.

1112
01:45:44,386 --> 01:45:47,598
And you?
You're Aragog, aren't you?

1113
01:45:48,223 --> 01:45:49,516
Yes.

1114
01:45:49,683 --> 01:45:53,479
Hagrid has never sent
men into our hollow before.

1115
01:45:53,645 --> 01:45:56,773
He's in trouble. Up at the school,
there have been attacks.

1116
01:45:57,399 --> 01:45:59,234
They think it's Hagrid.

1117
01:45:59,401 --> 01:46:03,030
They think he opened
the Chamber of Secrets. Like before.

1118
01:46:03,238 --> 01:46:05,574
That's a lie.

1119
01:46:06,033 --> 01:46:08,952
Hagrid never opened
the Chamber of Secrets.

1120
01:46:09,578 --> 01:46:12,456
- Then you're not the monster?
- No.

1121
01:46:12,623 --> 01:46:15,667
The monster was born in the castle.

1122
01:46:15,876 --> 01:46:21,173
I came to Hagrid from a distant land
in the pocket of a traveler.

1123
01:46:21,799 --> 01:46:23,425
Harry.

1124
01:46:25,344 --> 01:46:29,932
But if you're not the monster, then
what did kill that girl 50 years ago?

1125
01:46:30,098 --> 01:46:33,101
We do not speak of it.

1126
01:46:33,435 --> 01:46:38,982
It is an ancient creature we
spiders fear above all others.

1127
01:46:39,149 --> 01:46:40,943
But have you seen it?

1128
01:46:41,610 --> 01:46:47,449
I never saw any part of the castle
but the box in which Hagrid kept me.

1129
01:46:47,616 --> 01:46:50,786
The girl was discovered
in a bathroom.

1130
01:46:50,953 --> 01:46:55,457
When I was accused,
Hagrid brought me here.

1131
01:46:55,624 --> 01:46:57,626
- Harry!
- What?

1132
01:47:10,472 --> 01:47:13,475
Well, thank you.

1133
01:47:14,434 --> 01:47:16,603
We'll just go.

1134
01:47:17,062 --> 01:47:18,814
Go?

1135
01:47:19,022 --> 01:47:20,816
I think not.

1136
01:47:20,983 --> 01:47:26,446
My sons and daughters
do not harm Hagrid on my command.

1137
01:47:26,613 --> 01:47:29,032
But I cannot deny them
fresh meat...

1138
01:47:29,199 --> 01:47:33,537
...when it wanders
so willingly into our midst.

1139
01:47:33,704 --> 01:47:37,499
Goodbye, friend of Hagrid.

1140
01:47:37,666 --> 01:47:39,501
Can we panic now?

1141
01:47:50,220 --> 01:47:52,139
Know any spells?

1142
01:47:52,306 --> 01:47:55,476
One, but it's not powerful
enough for all of them.

1143
01:47:55,642 --> 01:47:58,395
Where's Hermione when you need her?

1144
01:48:11,909 --> 01:48:13,202
Let's go!

1145
01:48:18,332 --> 01:48:20,417
<i>Arania Exumai!</i>

1146
01:48:25,714 --> 01:48:27,049
Go!

1147
01:48:45,025 --> 01:48:47,110
Glad we're out of there.

1148
01:48:54,076 --> 01:48:56,411
<i>Arania Exumai!</i>

1149
01:49:02,126 --> 01:49:05,879
- Thanks for that.
- Don't mention it.

1150
01:49:16,807 --> 01:49:18,976
Get us out of here.

1151
01:49:19,476 --> 01:49:21,145
Now!

1152
01:49:23,230 --> 01:49:27,484
Come on!
Come on, move faster!

1153
01:49:30,154 --> 01:49:31,488
Come on! Go!

1154
01:49:49,006 --> 01:49:51,049
Get us in the air.

1155
01:49:52,134 --> 01:49:53,594
The flying gear's jammed!

1156
01:49:57,681 --> 01:50:01,477
- Come on! Pull!
- I'm trying!

1157
01:50:30,798 --> 01:50:33,717
Follow the spiders.
Follow the spiders.

1158
01:50:33,884 --> 01:50:38,222
If Hagrid ever gets out of Azkaban,
I'll kill him.

1159
01:50:52,236 --> 01:50:55,447
I mean, what was the point
of sending us in there?

1160
01:50:55,614 --> 01:51:00,244
- What have we found out?
- We know one thing.

1161
01:51:00,410 --> 01:51:03,789
Hagrid never opened
the Chamber of Secrets.

1162
01:51:03,997 --> 01:51:05,999
He was innocent.

1163
01:51:21,473 --> 01:51:23,934
Wish you were here, Hermione.

1164
01:51:24,476 --> 01:51:26,770
We need you.

1165
01:51:27,688 --> 01:51:29,773
Now more than ever.

1166
01:51:46,707 --> 01:51:50,127
- What's that?
- Ron...

1167
01:51:50,961 --> 01:51:55,424
This is why Hermione was in
the library the day she was attacked.

1168
01:51:55,966 --> 01:51:57,217
Come on.

1169
01:51:57,885 --> 01:52:00,846
"Of the many fearsome beasts
that roam our land...

1170
01:52:01,013 --> 01:52:05,642
...none is more deadly than the basilisk.
Capable of living for hundreds of years...

1171
01:52:05,809 --> 01:52:09,605
...instant death awaits any who meet
this giant serpent's eye.

1172
01:52:09,771 --> 01:52:12,774
Spiders flee before it. "
Ron, this is it.

1173
01:52:12,941 --> 01:52:15,736
The monster in the Chamber
of Secrets is a basilisk.

1174
01:52:15,903 --> 01:52:19,823
That's why I can hear it speak.
It's a snake.

1175
01:52:20,157 --> 01:52:25,454
But if it kills by looking people
in the eye, why is it no one's dead?

1176
01:52:36,089 --> 01:52:39,009
Because no one did look it
in the eye.

1177
01:52:40,969 --> 01:52:43,555
Not directly, at least.

1178
01:52:44,807 --> 01:52:47,017
Colin saw it through his camera.

1179
01:52:47,184 --> 01:52:51,230
Justin... Justin must have seen the
basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick.

1180
01:52:51,396 --> 01:52:55,400
Nick got the full blast of it.
But he's a ghost, he couldn't die again.

1181
01:52:55,567 --> 01:52:58,695
And Hermione had the mirror.

1182
01:52:58,862 --> 01:53:02,241
I bet you she was using it to look
around corners in case it came along.

1183
01:53:02,407 --> 01:53:03,700
And Mrs. Norris?

1184
01:53:03,867 --> 01:53:07,371
I'm pretty sure she didn't have
a camera or a mirror, Harry.

1185
01:53:08,914 --> 01:53:10,791
The water.

1186
01:53:11,250 --> 01:53:16,839
There was water on the floor that night.
She only saw the basilisk's reflection.

1187
01:53:22,970 --> 01:53:24,888
"Spiders flee before it. "

1188
01:53:25,055 --> 01:53:28,809
- It all fits.
- How's a basilisk been getting around?

1189
01:53:28,976 --> 01:53:31,812
A dirty, great snake.
Someone would have seen it.

1190
01:53:31,979 --> 01:53:37,651
- Hermione's answered that too.
- Pipes? It's using the plumbing.

1191
01:53:37,818 --> 01:53:42,072
Remember what Aragog said
about that girl 50 years ago?

1192
01:53:42,239 --> 01:53:46,493
She died in a bathroom?
What if she never left?

1193
01:53:47,161 --> 01:53:48,495
Moaning Myrtle.

1194
01:53:49,455 --> 01:53:53,500
<i>All students are to return
to their house dormitories at once.</i>

1195
01:53:53,667 --> 01:53:57,087
<i>All teachers to the second-floor
corridor immediately.</i>

1196
01:54:02,092 --> 01:54:07,931
As you can see, the Heir of Slytherin
has left another message.

1197
01:54:08,098 --> 01:54:10,309
Our worst fear has been realized.

1198
01:54:10,476 --> 01:54:15,063
A student has been taken by the monster
into the Chamber itself.

1199
01:54:16,106 --> 01:54:21,778
The students must be sent home.
I'm afraid this is the end of Hogwarts.

1200
01:54:24,156 --> 01:54:26,617
So sorry. Dozed off.
What have I missed?

1201
01:54:26,783 --> 01:54:31,121
A girl has been snatched by the monster,
Lockhart. Your moment has come at last.

1202
01:54:31,288 --> 01:54:34,249
- My moment?
- Weren't you saying just last night...

1203
01:54:34,416 --> 01:54:38,962
...that you've known all along where the
entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?

1204
01:54:40,297 --> 01:54:45,803
That's settled. We'll leave you
to deal with the monster, Gilderoy.

1205
01:54:45,969 --> 01:54:51,141
- Your skills, after all, are legend.
- Very well.

1206
01:54:51,308 --> 01:54:54,520
I'll just be in my office getting...

1207
01:54:55,354 --> 01:54:57,314
Getting ready.

1208
01:55:00,234 --> 01:55:03,445
Who is it that the monster's taken,
Minerva?

1209
01:55:03,612 --> 01:55:05,447
Ginny Weasley.

1210
01:55:16,834 --> 01:55:19,920
"Her skeleton will lie
in the Chamber forever. "

1211
01:55:23,966 --> 01:55:25,759
Ginny.

1212
01:55:27,845 --> 01:55:31,348
Lockhart may be useless, but he's
going to try and get into the Chamber.

1213
01:55:31,515 --> 01:55:34,226
At least we can tell him
what we know.

1214
01:55:35,561 --> 01:55:38,147
Professor, we have some information
for you.

1215
01:55:39,898 --> 01:55:41,859
Are you going somewhere?

1216
01:55:42,025 --> 01:55:45,154
Well, yes. Urgent call. Unavoidable.
Got to go.

1217
01:55:45,320 --> 01:55:48,532
- What about my sister?
- Well...

1218
01:55:48,866 --> 01:55:52,369
As to that, most unfortunate.
No one regrets more than I.

1219
01:55:52,536 --> 01:55:56,540
You're the Defense Against the Dark
Arts teacher. You can't go now.

1220
01:55:56,707 --> 01:55:59,710
I must say, when I took the job,
there was nothing in the description...

1221
01:55:59,877 --> 01:56:01,044
You're running away?

1222
01:56:01,211 --> 01:56:04,006
- After all you did in your books?
- Books can be misleading.

1223
01:56:04,173 --> 01:56:06,717
- You wrote them.
- My dear boy, use your common sense.

1224
01:56:06,884 --> 01:56:11,305
My books wouldn't have sold as well if
people didn't think I'd done those things.

1225
01:56:11,889 --> 01:56:13,474
You're a fraud.

1226
01:56:13,640 --> 01:56:16,435
You've been taking credit
for what other wizards have done.

1227
01:56:16,602 --> 01:56:18,562
Is there anything you can do?

1228
01:56:18,729 --> 01:56:23,442
Yes, now you mention it.
I'm rather gifted with Memory Charms.

1229
01:56:23,609 --> 01:56:26,111
Otherwise, all those wizards
would have gone blabbing.

1230
01:56:26,278 --> 01:56:29,406
I'd never have sold another book.

1231
01:56:29,573 --> 01:56:35,287
In fact, I'm going to have to do
the same to you.

1232
01:56:35,788 --> 01:56:38,582
Don't even think about it.

1233
01:56:49,426 --> 01:56:50,886
Who's there?

1234
01:56:53,305 --> 01:56:55,349
Hello, Harry.

1235
01:56:56,266 --> 01:57:01,438
- What do you want?
- To ask you how you died.

1236
01:57:03,816 --> 01:57:06,276
It was dreadful.

1237
01:57:06,443 --> 01:57:10,113
It happened right here
in this very cubicle.

1238
01:57:10,280 --> 01:57:14,326
I'd hidden because Olive Hornby
was teasing me about my glasses.

1239
01:57:14,493 --> 01:57:19,414
I was crying, and then
I heard somebody come in.

1240
01:57:19,581 --> 01:57:25,321
- Who was it, Myrtle?
- I don't know. I was distraught!

1241
01:57:27,214 --> 01:57:30,634
But they said something funny,
a kind of made-up language.

1242
01:57:30,801 --> 01:57:36,141
And I realized it was a boy, so I unlocked
the door to tell him to go away and...

1243
01:57:38,308 --> 01:57:43,147
...I died.
- Just like that? How?

1244
01:57:43,313 --> 01:57:47,818
I just remember seeing a pair
of great, big, yellow eyes...

1245
01:57:47,985 --> 01:57:51,822
...over there by that sink.

1246
01:58:16,930 --> 01:58:18,974
This is it.

1247
01:58:19,850 --> 01:58:24,688
This is it, Ron. I think this is
the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets.

1248
01:58:26,690 --> 01:58:31,528
Say something. Harry,
say something in Parseltongue.

1249
01:59:23,080 --> 01:59:27,167
Excellent, Harry. Good work.
Well, then, I'll just be...

1250
01:59:27,334 --> 01:59:29,586
There's no need for me to stay.

1251
01:59:30,212 --> 01:59:32,089
Yes, there is.

1252
01:59:33,924 --> 01:59:37,010
- You first.
- Now, boys, what good will it do?

1253
01:59:37,177 --> 01:59:38,512
Better you than us.

1254
01:59:39,721 --> 01:59:42,641
But... Obviously, yes.

1255
01:59:46,937 --> 01:59:49,648
Sure you don't want to test it first?

1256
01:59:56,446 --> 01:59:59,700
It's really quite filthy down here.

1257
02:00:00,159 --> 02:00:04,705
- All right. Let's go.
- Oh, Harry?

1258
02:00:05,122 --> 02:00:10,043
If you die down there,
you're welcome to share my toilet.

1259
02:00:12,588 --> 02:00:14,548
Thanks, Myrtle.

1260
02:00:43,660 --> 02:00:48,832
Now, remember: Any sign of movement,
close your eyes straightaway.

1261
02:00:49,792 --> 02:00:51,460
Go on.

1262
02:00:55,172 --> 02:00:56,507
This way.

1263
02:01:03,514 --> 02:01:08,769
- What's this?
- It looks like a snake.

1264
02:01:08,936 --> 02:01:12,606
- It's a snakeskin.
- Bloody hell.

1265
02:01:12,773 --> 02:01:18,570
Whatever shed this must be
60 feet long. Or more.

1266
02:01:20,489 --> 02:01:23,450
Heart of a lion, this one.

1267
02:01:27,162 --> 02:01:31,834
The adventure ends here, boys.
But don't fret.

1268
02:01:33,752 --> 02:01:39,216
The world will know our story.
How I was too late to save the girl.

1269
02:01:39,550 --> 02:01:43,053
How you two
tragically lost your minds...

1270
02:01:43,220 --> 02:01:46,223
...at the sight of her mangled body.

1271
02:01:47,057 --> 02:01:48,517
So...

1272
02:01:49,643 --> 02:01:51,979
You first, Mr. Potter.

1273
02:01:52,229 --> 02:01:55,399
Say goodbye to your memories.

1274
02:01:57,442 --> 02:01:59,403
<i>Obliviate!</i>

1275
02:02:33,312 --> 02:02:36,440
- Ron! Ron, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

1276
02:02:40,194 --> 02:02:41,945
Hello.

1277
02:02:42,613 --> 02:02:44,448
Who are you?

1278
02:02:45,824 --> 02:02:48,494
- Ron Weasley.
- Really?

1279
02:02:48,660 --> 02:02:51,538
And who am I?

1280
02:02:53,290 --> 02:02:57,628
Lockhart's Memory Charm backfired.
He hasn't got a clue who he is.

1281
02:02:57,961 --> 02:03:02,466
It's an odd sort of place, isn't it?

1282
02:03:02,633 --> 02:03:04,760
Do you live here?

1283
02:03:05,469 --> 02:03:07,971
- No.
- Really?

1284
02:03:12,559 --> 02:03:14,353
- What do I do now?
- You wait here...

1285
02:03:14,520 --> 02:03:17,481
...and try and shift some of this rock
so we can get back through.

1286
02:03:17,648 --> 02:03:21,318
- I'll go on and find Ginny.
- Okay.

1287
02:04:54,536 --> 02:04:58,415
Ginny! Ginny, please don't be dead.
Wake up, wake up.

1288
02:04:58,916 --> 02:05:01,001
Please wake up.

1289
02:05:01,251 --> 02:05:03,420
She won't wake.

1290
02:05:08,884 --> 02:05:13,222
Tom. Tom Riddle.
What do you mean, she won't wake?

1291
02:05:13,388 --> 02:05:16,767
- She's not...?
- She's still alive, but only just.

1292
02:05:17,768 --> 02:05:20,062
- Are you a ghost?
- A memory...

1293
02:05:20,229 --> 02:05:22,606
...preserved in a diary for 50 years.

1294
02:05:25,275 --> 02:05:30,489
She's cold as ice.
Ginny, please don't be dead. Wake up.

1295
02:05:30,656 --> 02:05:33,075
You've got to help me, Tom.
There's a basilisk.

1296
02:05:33,242 --> 02:05:35,828
It won't come until it's called.

1297
02:05:38,622 --> 02:05:41,458
- Give me my wand, Tom.
- You won't be needing it.

1298
02:05:42,501 --> 02:05:45,921
- We've got to go. We've got to save her.
- I'm afraid I can't do that.

1299
02:05:46,088 --> 02:05:50,134
You see, as poor Ginny grows weaker,
I grow stronger.

1300
02:05:51,468 --> 02:05:55,973
Yes, Harry, it was Ginny Weasley
who opened the Chamber of Secrets.

1301
02:05:56,140 --> 02:05:58,475
No. She couldn't. She wouldn't.

1302
02:05:58,642 --> 02:06:01,854
It was Ginny who set the basilisk
on the Mudbloods and Filch's cat...

1303
02:06:02,020 --> 02:06:04,481
...Ginny who wrote the threatening
messages on the walls.

1304
02:06:04,648 --> 02:06:07,943
- But why?
- Because I told her to.

1305
02:06:08,110 --> 02:06:13,073
You'll find I can be very persuasive.
Not that she knew what she was doing.

1306
02:06:13,240 --> 02:06:16,577
She was, shall we say,
in a kind of trance.

1307
02:06:17,119 --> 02:06:19,621
Still, the power of the diary
began to scare her.

1308
02:06:19,788 --> 02:06:22,166
She tried to dispose of it
in the girls' bathroom.

1309
02:06:22,332 --> 02:06:26,670
And then who should find it but you?

1310
02:06:26,837 --> 02:06:29,965
The very person
I was most anxious to meet.

1311
02:06:30,549 --> 02:06:32,634
And why did you want to meet me?

1312
02:06:33,010 --> 02:06:36,388
I knew I had to talk to you,
meet you if I could.

1313
02:06:36,555 --> 02:06:39,850
So I decided to show you my capture
of that brainless oaf Hagrid...

1314
02:06:40,017 --> 02:06:43,187
...to gain your trust.
- Hagrid's my friend.

1315
02:06:44,104 --> 02:06:48,692
- And you framed him, didn't you?
- It was my word against Hagrid's.

1316
02:06:48,859 --> 02:06:52,154
Only Dumbledore seemed to think
he was innocent.

1317
02:06:52,321 --> 02:06:54,490
I'll bet Dumbledore saw
right through you.

1318
02:06:54,656 --> 02:06:58,118
He certainly kept an annoyingly close
watch on me after that.

1319
02:06:58,285 --> 02:07:01,580
I knew it wouldn't be safe to open the
Chamber again while I was at school...

1320
02:07:01,747 --> 02:07:03,582
...so I decided to leave behind
a diary...

1321
02:07:03,749 --> 02:07:05,876
...preserving my 16-year-old self
in its pages...

1322
02:07:06,043 --> 02:07:08,712
...so that one day
I would be able to lead another...

1323
02:07:08,879 --> 02:07:11,715
...to finish Salazar Slytherin's
noble work.

1324
02:07:11,882 --> 02:07:14,134
Well, you haven't finished it
this time.

1325
02:07:14,301 --> 02:07:17,262
In a few hours, the Mandrake Draught
will be ready.

1326
02:07:17,429 --> 02:07:20,182
And everyone who was Petrified
will be all right again.

1327
02:07:20,557 --> 02:07:25,813
Haven't I told you? Killing Mudbloods
doesn't matter to me anymore.

1328
02:07:26,063 --> 02:07:30,859
For many months now,
my new target has been you.

1329
02:07:32,319 --> 02:07:35,906
How is it that a baby
with no extraordinary magical talent...

1330
02:07:36,073 --> 02:07:38,742
...was able to defeat the greatest wizard
of all time?

1331
02:07:39,076 --> 02:07:42,037
How did you escape with nothing
but a scar...

1332
02:07:42,204 --> 02:07:44,581
...while Lord Voldemort's powers
were destroyed?

1333
02:07:44,748 --> 02:07:48,919
Why do you care how I escaped?
Voldemort was after your time.

1334
02:07:49,086 --> 02:07:54,992
Voldemort is my past,
present and future.

1335
02:08:15,988 --> 02:08:19,450
You. You're the Heir of Slytherin.

1336
02:08:22,619 --> 02:08:26,206
- You're Voldemort.
- Surely you didn't think...

1337
02:08:26,373 --> 02:08:30,878
...I was going to keep
my filthy Muggle father's name?

1338
02:08:31,044 --> 02:08:35,215
No. I fashioned myself a new name,
a name I knew wizards everywhere...

1339
02:08:35,382 --> 02:08:39,595
...would fear to speak when I became
the greatest sorcerer in the world.

1340
02:08:39,761 --> 02:08:42,931
Albus Dumbledore
is the greatest sorcerer in the world.

1341
02:08:43,098 --> 02:08:46,477
Dumbledore's been driven out of
this castle by the mere memory of me.

1342
02:08:46,685 --> 02:08:51,732
He'll never be gone. Not as long as
those who remain are loyal to him.

1343
02:08:58,113 --> 02:08:59,156
Fawkes?

1344
02:09:15,422 --> 02:09:19,009
So this is what Dumbledore
sends his great defender.

1345
02:09:19,176 --> 02:09:22,846
A songbird and an old hat.

1346
02:09:36,151 --> 02:09:40,697
Let's match the power of Lord
Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin...

1347
02:09:40,864 --> 02:09:44,868
...against the famous Harry Potter.

1348
02:09:58,215 --> 02:10:02,553
Parseltongue won't save you now,
Potter. It only obeys me.

1349
02:10:32,749 --> 02:10:34,293
No!

1350
02:10:34,751 --> 02:10:39,256
Your bird may have blinded the basilisk,
but it can still hear you.

1351
02:12:21,233 --> 02:12:24,528
Yes, Potter.
The process is nearly complete.

1352
02:12:24,695 --> 02:12:29,616
In a few minutes, Ginny Weasley will be
dead, and I will cease to be a memory.

1353
02:12:29,783 --> 02:12:32,453
Lord Voldemort will return...

1354
02:12:32,828 --> 02:12:37,040
...very much alive.

1355
02:12:37,749 --> 02:12:39,168
Ginny?

1356
02:14:55,512 --> 02:14:57,097
Remarkable, isn't it...

1357
02:14:57,264 --> 02:15:01,268
...how quickly the venom
of the basilisk penetrates the body?

1358
02:15:01,435 --> 02:15:04,104
I'd guess you have little more
than a minute to live.

1359
02:15:04,438 --> 02:15:08,484
You'll be with your dear
Mudblood mother soon, Harry.

1360
02:15:13,489 --> 02:15:17,159
Funny, the damage a silly
little book can do...

1361
02:15:17,326 --> 02:15:22,372
...especially in the hands
of a silly little girl.

1362
02:15:25,209 --> 02:15:27,044
What are you doing?

1363
02:15:29,880 --> 02:15:32,007
Stop. No!

1364
02:16:30,274 --> 02:16:34,278
It was me.
But I swear, I didn't mean to.

1365
02:16:34,445 --> 02:16:37,948
Riddle made me, and...

1366
02:16:38,449 --> 02:16:41,118
Harry, you're hurt.

1367
02:16:41,452 --> 02:16:42,953
Don't worry.

1368
02:16:43,120 --> 02:16:46,790
Ginny, you need
to get yourself out.

1369
02:16:46,957 --> 02:16:50,210
Follow the Chamber
and you'll find Ron.

1370
02:17:02,347 --> 02:17:04,475
You were brilliant, Fawkes.

1371
02:17:05,601 --> 02:17:08,020
I just wasn't quick enough.

1372
02:17:28,832 --> 02:17:30,542
Of course.

1373
02:17:30,834 --> 02:17:33,670
Phoenix tears have healing powers.

1374
02:17:35,297 --> 02:17:37,090
Thanks.

1375
02:17:38,842 --> 02:17:40,969
It's all right, Ginny.

1376
02:17:42,095 --> 02:17:44,306
It's over.

1377
02:17:45,307 --> 02:17:47,851
It's just a memory.

1378
02:17:50,729 --> 02:17:56,068
Amazing!
This is just like magic!

1379
02:18:07,371 --> 02:18:10,040
You both realize, of course...

1380
02:18:10,207 --> 02:18:15,712
...that in the past few hours, you have
broken perhaps a dozen school rules.

1381
02:18:16,338 --> 02:18:17,381
Yes, sir.

1382
02:18:17,548 --> 02:18:20,759
There is sufficient evidence
to have you both expelled.

1383
02:18:20,926 --> 02:18:22,136
Yes, sir.

1384
02:18:22,302 --> 02:18:25,055
Therefore, it is only fitting...

1385
02:18:26,598 --> 02:18:28,892
...that you both receive...

1386
02:18:29,393 --> 02:18:33,480
...Special Awards for Services
to the School.

1387
02:18:35,566 --> 02:18:37,401
Thanks, sir.

1388
02:18:37,985 --> 02:18:40,279
Now, Mr. Weasley, if you would...

1389
02:18:40,446 --> 02:18:44,616
...have an owl deliver these
release papers to Azkaban.

1390
02:18:45,742 --> 02:18:50,497
I believe we want
our gamekeeper back.

1391
02:18:55,461 --> 02:18:59,798
First, I want to thank you, Harry.

1392
02:19:00,424 --> 02:19:03,927
You must have shown me
real loyalty down in the Chamber.

1393
02:19:04,803 --> 02:19:09,391
Nothing but that
could have called Fawkes to you.

1394
02:19:11,768 --> 02:19:13,312
And...

1395
02:19:13,896 --> 02:19:15,314
...second...

1396
02:19:15,481 --> 02:19:20,277
...I sense that something
is troubling you.

1397
02:19:20,486 --> 02:19:22,988
Am I right, Harry?

1398
02:19:24,823 --> 02:19:26,575
It's just...

1399
02:19:27,743 --> 02:19:32,456
You see, sir, I couldn't help
but notice certain things, certain...

1400
02:19:32,623 --> 02:19:38,295
Certain similarities
between Tom Riddle and me.

1401
02:19:38,837 --> 02:19:40,047
I see.

1402
02:19:40,214 --> 02:19:46,011
Well, you can speak
Parseltongue, Harry. Why?

1403
02:19:46,470 --> 02:19:51,975
Because Lord Voldemort
can speak Parseltongue.

1404
02:19:53,185 --> 02:19:55,938
If I'm not mistaken, Harry...

1405
02:19:56,313 --> 02:20:00,150
...he transferred
some of his powers to you...

1406
02:20:00,317 --> 02:20:03,278
...the night he gave you that scar.

1407
02:20:03,445 --> 02:20:07,324
Voldemort transferred
some of his powers to me?

1408
02:20:09,243 --> 02:20:11,954
Not intentionally...

1409
02:20:12,830 --> 02:20:14,748
...but yes.

1410
02:20:16,667 --> 02:20:20,003
So the Sorting Hat was right.
I should be in Slytherin.

1411
02:20:20,170 --> 02:20:25,008
It's true. You possess many of the
qualities that Voldemort himself prizes.

1412
02:20:25,175 --> 02:20:28,011
Determination, resourcefulness...

1413
02:20:28,178 --> 02:20:32,182
...and if I may say so,
a certain disregard for the rules.

1414
02:20:32,891 --> 02:20:36,895
Why, then, did the Sorting Hat
place you in Gryffindor?

1415
02:20:37,729 --> 02:20:41,400
- Because I asked it to.
- Exactly, Harry. Exactly.

1416
02:20:41,567 --> 02:20:43,652
Which makes you different
from Voldemort.

1417
02:20:43,819 --> 02:20:47,698
It is not our abilities
that show what we truly are.

1418
02:20:47,990 --> 02:20:50,117
It is our choices.

1419
02:20:53,787 --> 02:20:57,207
If you want proof
why you belong in Gryffindor...

1420
02:20:57,374 --> 02:21:02,254
...then I suggest
you look more closely at this.

1421
02:21:03,255 --> 02:21:04,923
Be careful.

1422
02:21:10,596 --> 02:21:13,265
Godric Gryffindor.

1423
02:21:13,432 --> 02:21:17,519
It would take a true Gryffindor
to pull that out of the hat.

1424
02:21:26,403 --> 02:21:27,780
Dobby.

1425
02:21:29,072 --> 02:21:33,452
So this is your master.
The family you serve is the Malfoys.

1426
02:21:35,621 --> 02:21:38,957
I'll deal with you later.

1427
02:21:44,797 --> 02:21:46,423
Out of my way, Potter.

1428
02:21:46,590 --> 02:21:50,177
So it's true. You have returned.

1429
02:21:50,844 --> 02:21:53,639
When the governors learned that
Arthur Weasley's daughter...

1430
02:21:53,806 --> 02:21:57,976
...was taken into the Chamber,
they saw fit to summon me back.

1431
02:21:58,811 --> 02:22:02,898
- Ridiculous.
- Curiously, Lucius, several of them...

1432
02:22:03,065 --> 02:22:06,735
...were under the impression
that you would curse their family...

1433
02:22:06,902 --> 02:22:09,738
...if they did not agree
to suspend me in the first place.

1434
02:22:10,197 --> 02:22:13,659
- How dare you!
- Beg your pardon?

1435
02:22:13,826 --> 02:22:17,621
My sole concern has always been
and will always be...

1436
02:22:17,788 --> 02:22:20,624
...the welfare of this school...

1437
02:22:20,791 --> 02:22:25,087
...and, of course, its students.

1438
02:22:29,133 --> 02:22:33,345
The culprit has been identified,
I presume?

1439
02:22:33,720 --> 02:22:35,264
Yes.

1440
02:22:36,849 --> 02:22:38,684
And?

1441
02:22:39,852 --> 02:22:41,895
Who was it?

1442
02:22:48,318 --> 02:22:50,863
Voldemort.

1443
02:22:52,030 --> 02:22:57,494
Only this time he chose to act
through somebody else...

1444
02:22:58,036 --> 02:23:01,665
...by means of this.

1445
02:23:04,334 --> 02:23:05,878
I see.

1446
02:23:07,337 --> 02:23:11,550
Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter
discovered it.

1447
02:23:11,884 --> 02:23:15,554
One hopes that no more of Lord
Voldemort's old school-things...

1448
02:23:15,721 --> 02:23:18,974
...should find their way
into innocent hands.

1449
02:23:19,308 --> 02:23:23,228
The consequences for the one
responsible would be...

1450
02:23:23,604 --> 02:23:25,481
...severe.

1451
02:23:26,899 --> 02:23:29,693
Well, let us hope...

1452
02:23:29,860 --> 02:23:35,407
...that Mr. Potter will always
be around to save the day.

1453
02:23:36,158 --> 02:23:39,912
Don't worry. I will be.

1454
02:23:48,670 --> 02:23:50,714
Dumbledore.

1455
02:23:51,840 --> 02:23:55,385
Come, Dobby. We're leaving.

1456
02:24:12,653 --> 02:24:17,116
Sir?
I wonder if I could have that?

1457
02:24:23,539 --> 02:24:25,124
Mr. Malfoy.

1458
02:24:25,290 --> 02:24:27,501
Mr. Malfoy!

1459
02:24:27,960 --> 02:24:30,129
I have something of yours.

1460
02:24:31,797 --> 02:24:34,758
Mine? I don't know
what you're talking about.

1461
02:24:34,925 --> 02:24:36,468
I think you do, sir.

1462
02:24:36,635 --> 02:24:39,763
I think you slipped the diary
into Ginny Weasley's cauldron...

1463
02:24:39,930 --> 02:24:41,348
...that day at Diagon Alley.

1464
02:24:42,057 --> 02:24:44,601
You do, do you?

1465
02:24:51,942 --> 02:24:55,028
Why don't you prove it?

1466
02:25:01,285 --> 02:25:03,454
Come, Dobby.

1467
02:25:04,746 --> 02:25:06,790
Open it.

1468
02:25:10,294 --> 02:25:11,837
Dobby.

1469
02:25:12,004 --> 02:25:15,174
Master has given Dobby a sock.

1470
02:25:15,466 --> 02:25:17,551
What? I didn't give...

1471
02:25:17,718 --> 02:25:21,430
Master has presented Dobby
with clothes.

1472
02:25:21,597 --> 02:25:24,641
Dobby is free.

1473
02:25:31,190 --> 02:25:34,943
You lost me my servant!

1474
02:25:41,909 --> 02:25:45,913
You shall not harm Harry Potter.

1475
02:25:58,050 --> 02:26:01,762
Your parents were
meddlesome fools too.

1476
02:26:01,929 --> 02:26:05,098
Mark my words, Potter.
One day soon...

1477
02:26:05,265 --> 02:26:10,479
...you are going to meet
the same sticky end.

1478
02:26:16,193 --> 02:26:22,074
Harry Potter freed Dobby.
How can Dobby ever repay him?

1479
02:26:22,449 --> 02:26:26,703
- Just promise me something.
- Anything, sir.

1480
02:26:28,664 --> 02:26:31,125
Never try to save my life again.

1481
02:26:37,256 --> 02:26:40,259
- Welcome back, Sir Nicholas.
- Thank you.

1482
02:26:40,551 --> 02:26:42,928
- Good evening, Sir Nicholas.
- Good evening.

1483
02:26:43,095 --> 02:26:46,014
- Good to see you, Sir Nicholas.
- Thank you.

1484
02:26:47,391 --> 02:26:49,601
Hello.

1485
02:26:51,311 --> 02:26:55,941
- Hermione! Welcome back.
- Thanks, Sir Nicholas.

1486
02:26:59,194 --> 02:27:02,531
Harry. It's Hermione.

1487
02:27:29,349 --> 02:27:33,061
- Welcome back, Hermione.
- It's good to be back.

1488
02:27:33,228 --> 02:27:35,814
Congratulations.
I can't believe you solved it.

1489
02:27:35,981 --> 02:27:38,233
We had loads of help from you.

1490
02:27:38,400 --> 02:27:41,612
- We couldn't have done it without you.
- Thanks.

1491
02:27:43,447 --> 02:27:46,408
Could I have your attention, please?

1492
02:27:50,579 --> 02:27:53,081
Before we begin the feast...

1493
02:27:53,248 --> 02:27:59,005
...let us have a round of applause
for Professor Sprout, Madam Pomfrey...

1494
02:27:59,671 --> 02:28:03,801
...whose Mandrake juice has been
so successfully administered...

1495
02:28:03,967 --> 02:28:06,637
...to all who had been Petrified.

1496
02:28:17,147 --> 02:28:20,150
Also, in light of the recent events...

1497
02:28:20,317 --> 02:28:22,486
...as a school treat...

1498
02:28:22,653 --> 02:28:26,615
...all exams have been canceled.

1499
02:28:29,284 --> 02:28:30,869
<i>Oh, no.</i>

1500
02:28:47,803 --> 02:28:49,847
Sorry I'm late.

1501
02:28:55,894 --> 02:29:00,315
The owl that delivered my release papers
got all lost and confused.

1502
02:29:00,649 --> 02:29:03,944
Some ruddy bird called Errol.

1503
02:29:19,710 --> 02:29:24,716
And I'd just like to say that if it hadn't
been for you, Harry and Ron...

1504
02:29:25,924 --> 02:29:28,886
...and Hermione, of course...

1505
02:29:29,553 --> 02:29:33,640
...I would still be you-know-where...

1506
02:29:33,807 --> 02:29:37,394
...so I'd just like to say thanks.

1507
02:29:46,779 --> 02:29:49,740
There's no Hogwarts
without you, Hagrid.
