640
00:54:48,231 --> 00:54:50,392
Look, what do you want me to say?

641
00:54:50,467 --> 00:54:51,593
We set off a bomb.

642
00:54:51,668 --> 00:54:54,034
No, l set off a bomb.

643
00:55:06,883 --> 00:55:09,852
Look, l know you paid
a price to get this far.

644
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:11,888
Okay? You're close.

645
00:55:11,955 --> 00:55:15,015
You're very close.

646
00:55:18,428 --> 00:55:20,953
l don't know, man.
You tell me.

647
00:55:22,532 --> 00:55:24,227
Do we stop?

What made you learn Arabic?

651
00:56:46,950 --> 00:56:49,714
l took a class in college
and got hooked.

652
00:56:49,786 --> 00:56:53,017
l even switched my major
from Religion to Arabic Studies.

653
00:56:53,090 --> 00:56:55,718
You were a Religion major?

654
00:56:55,792 --> 00:56:57,487
My daddy was a Baptist minister.

655
00:56:57,561 --> 00:57:00,155
His daddy was a Baptist minister.

656

lt's in the blood.

657
00:57:02,632 --> 00:57:04,725
You know, when J. Edgar
were in office,

658
00:57:04,801 --> 00:57:07,463
he never would have
let you into the FBl.

659
00:57:07,537 --> 00:57:09,232
Wasn't my original plan.

660
00:57:09,306 --> 00:57:13,208
Not a lot of jobs, however,
for Ph.D.s in Arabic Studies.

661
00:57:13,276 --> 00:57:14,607
Oh, l get it now.

662
00:57:14,678 --> 00:57:17,772
You were an egghead
who got dragged into a street fight.

663
00:57:19,082 --> 00:57:21,642
Nobody gets dragged into a street fight.

666
00:57:48,912 --> 00:57:51,403
Welcome to Toronto, Brother Samir.

667
00:57:51,481 --> 00:57:53,506
lt's a great honor, Emir.

668
00:57:53,583 --> 00:57:54,948
Please, sit.

669
00:57:55,018 --> 00:57:56,280
Thank you.

670
00:57:59,790 --> 00:58:02,122
- Tea?
- Yes, thank you.

671
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:09,358
Omar tells me that you play chess.

672
00:58:09,432 --> 00:58:11,195
Only a little. Thank you.

673
00:58:11,268 --> 00:58:13,964
ln chess and in war,
the key to winning

674
00:58:14,037 --> 00:58:17,200
is to anticipate what your opponent
will do in advance.

675
00:58:17,274 --> 00:58:19,606
Think two moves ahead.

676
00:58:19,676 --> 00:58:21,974
The art of asymmetrical warfare

677
00:58:22,045 --> 00:58:26,948
is less about inflicting damage
than provoking a response.

678
00:58:27,017 --> 00:58:29,315
Terrorism is theater.

679
00:58:29,386 --> 00:58:33,220
And theater is always performed
for an audience.

680
00:58:33,290 --> 00:58:36,054
Ours is the American people.

681
00:58:36,126 --> 00:58:42,087
But we are dispersed
across a large country.

682
00:58:42,165 --> 00:58:44,099
The question is,

683
00:58:44,167 --> 00:58:47,898
how to convince them
that nowhere is safe.

684
00:58:49,806 --> 00:58:51,706
Samir, imagine a bus
traveling cross-country

685
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:53,504
filled with average, everyday Americans.

686
00:58:53,577 --> 00:58:55,010
People from-- from all over.

687
00:58:55,078 --> 00:58:57,740
From small towns,
from the country.

688
00:58:57,814 --> 00:58:59,839
lmagine the effect it would have

689
00:58:59,916 --> 00:59:04,683
if that very same bus
were to suddenly explode.

690
00:59:04,754 --> 00:59:07,245
Now multiply that by 50.

691
00:59:07,324 --> 00:59:11,556
Fifty buses across
the heartland of America,

692
00:59:11,628 --> 00:59:13,357
all at the same time,

693
00:59:13,430 --> 00:59:15,921
on the same day.

694
00:59:15,999 --> 00:59:20,629
<i>We call this operation
Risala Shukra Al-hiba.</i>

695
00:59:20,704 --> 00:59:23,195
For years we've been planting
martyrs in their midst.

696
00:59:24,708 --> 00:59:26,733
They are waiting for a signal,

697
00:59:26,810 --> 00:59:29,836
instructions, material.

698
00:59:31,181 --> 00:59:35,584
We need somebody who can move
about the country without drawing attention.

699
00:59:35,652 --> 00:59:38,883
Somebody who blends in.

700
00:59:41,758 --> 00:59:44,318
An American messenger, Samir.

701
00:59:58,375 --> 01:00:01,037
He isn't capable of this.

702
01:00:01,111 --> 01:00:03,705
l don't like having to show
these to you, Chandra.

703
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:06,749
But we need to find him
before this happens again.

704
01:00:06,816 --> 01:00:11,981
Samir always said that these people
were lslam's worse enemies.

705
01:00:12,055 --> 01:00:14,615
Oh, he fought a Holy War
with these folks in Afghanistan

706
01:00:14,691 --> 01:00:16,556
and then again in Bosnia.

707
01:00:16,626 --> 01:00:18,560
He was trained to kill.

708
01:00:18,628 --> 01:00:21,222
He was a soldier, not a murderer.

709
01:00:22,832 --> 01:00:26,131
l believe he deceived you
as much as anybody else.

710
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:34,570
His faith was a source of strength.

711
01:00:35,979 --> 01:00:37,344
Not this.

712
01:00:56,199 --> 01:00:58,326
- Welcome to the U.S.
- Thanks.

713
01:01:29,099 --> 01:01:31,033
l'm a friend of Nassim's.

714
01:01:31,101 --> 01:01:33,433

about any of that, okay?

742
01:03:44,868 --> 01:03:46,495
We need to rethink things.

743
01:03:46,569 --> 01:03:50,096
lf you don't succeed,
we may not get another chance.

744

How far are you willing to take this?

745
01:03:56,746 --> 01:03:58,907
We've got blood on our hands.

746
01:03:58,982 --> 01:04:00,415
We've killed innocent people.

747
01:04:00,483 --> 01:04:03,509
Yeah, and if we stop now,

- Don't worry.
- lt still makes me nervous.

761
01:05:18,528 --> 01:05:21,156
We gotta talk about
how we're gonna send these e-mails.

762
01:05:21,231 --> 01:05:23,461
What do you mean?
l thought we decided to use coded e-mail.

763
01:05:23,533 --> 01:05:24,659
No, no, we did. We did.

764
01:05:24,734 --> 01:05:26,429
But the problem is e-mails
can get intercepted.

765
01:05:26,502 --> 01:05:29,027
l got a better idea.

766
01:05:29,105 --> 01:05:32,836
We're gonna give each of our people
an e-mail account and a password. All right?

767
01:05:32,909 --> 01:05:35,400
Then when we're ready to go,
we log onto each one,

768
01:05:35,478 --> 01:05:38,072
we write the instructions,
but we don't send them.

Nothing is sent.

There's nothing
for the FBl to intercept.

One of them has a record
of an operation--

960
01:25:45,620 --> 01:25:47,679
<i>Risala Shukra Al-hiba.</i>

961
01:25:47,756 --> 01:25:49,314
Where have l heard that before?

962
01:25:49,391 --> 01:25:50,517
Our phone intercept.

963
01:25:50,592 --> 01:25:52,958
Your intercept only picked up
the first part of the code name.

964
01:25:53,028 --> 01:25:55,792
The date of the attack
is in the full name. Leyla?

965
01:25:55,864 --> 01:25:57,195
<i>''Risala'' means ''message,''</i>

966
01:25:57,265 --> 01:26:00,098
<i>''Shukra'' means ''thanks''
and ''Al-hiba'' is ''the gift.''</i>

967
01:26:00,168 --> 01:26:03,433
So the literal translation is
''Message of thanks for the gift.''

968
01:26:03,505 --> 01:26:05,370
Thanksgiving.

969
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:07,499
Exactly.
That's when they're gonna strike.

971
01:26:09,444 --> 01:26:10,809
What about the target?

972
01:26:10,879 --> 01:26:13,109
Well, we found traces
of Semtex in the vehicle

973
01:26:13,181 --> 01:26:14,671
Horn abandoned in Chicago.

974
01:26:14,749 --> 01:26:16,717
But that was purchased
in California a month ago.

975
01:26:16,785 --> 01:26:20,949
And he could have been distributing bombs
right across the entire country by now.

976
01:26:23,992 --> 01:26:25,425
We'll raise the threat level.

977
01:26:25,494 --> 01:26:28,486
Double up protection on bridges,
airports, monuments, the White House.

978
01:26:28,563 --> 01:26:32,363
Sir, l would also suggest that we place Horn
on the high-value target list, too.

979
01:26:32,434 --> 01:26:33,924
He killed a good man.

980
01:26:34,002 --> 01:26:36,232
You're not going to get
any objections from us.

981
01:26:55,490 --> 01:26:58,425

- No.

982

Please, don't bullshit me.

985

Sorry.
lt's not your fault.

989
01:27:26,221 --> 01:27:27,813
l did this.

990
01:27:30,125 --> 01:27:31,956
We're only men, my friend.

992

Beautiful. Beautiful.

You know, it's true what they say.

995

War is the lesser jihad.

996

To overcome temptation,
to live rightly,

997
01:27:52,981 --> 01:27:55,916
that is the great jihad.

998

And is that what we've been doing?

999
01:28:08,096 --> 01:28:10,087
You ever ask yourself that?

1000

Sometimes.

1001
01:28:16,705 --> 01:28:18,730
But Nathir is the leader.

And my duty is to follow.

What is that?
What does that mean?

1007
01:28:49,571 --> 01:28:51,766
lt means l owe you an apology, Samir.

1008

01:42:33,527 --> 01:42:35,051
l saw the e-mails.

1117
01:42:35,129 --> 01:42:37,654
l changed the e-mails, Omar.

1118
01:42:42,169 --> 01:42:44,069
lt's over.

1119
01:42:48,108 --> 01:42:52,374
[crying]

1120
01:42:52,446 --> 01:42:54,710
l put my trust on you.

1121
01:42:54,782 --> 01:42:57,216
l thought you were my brother!

1122
01:43:06,527 --> 01:43:08,757
Omar.

1123
01:43:15,636 --> 01:43:17,934
Omar.

1124
01:43:23,677 --> 01:43:25,645
l am your brother.

1125
01:43:31,819 --> 01:43:34,549
They used you, Omar.

1126
01:43:34,622 --> 01:43:37,182
They used me, too.
All of them.

1127
01:43:37,258 --> 01:43:39,089
They used us for our faith.

1128
01:43:44,465 --> 01:43:46,831
[metallic clang]

1129
01:43:49,169 --> 01:43:50,397
- Drop your weapon!
- [men shouting indistinctly]

1130
01:43:50,471 --> 01:43:51,495
Omar. Omar!

1131
01:43:54,675 --> 01:43:57,007
Hold your fire. Hold your fire!

1132
01:44:04,218 --> 01:44:06,049
- Samir?
- [groaning]

1133
01:44:08,188 --> 01:44:09,485
Samir, where's Nathir?

1134
01:44:26,473 --> 01:44:28,566
Hang in there, Samir.

1135
01:44:28,642 --> 01:44:30,667
Call a paramedic.

1136
01:44:33,180 --> 01:44:35,045
lt'll be okay.

1137
01:45:08,315 --> 01:45:09,839
Samir.

1138
01:45:13,087 --> 01:45:15,521
You wanna take a ride and talk?

1139
01:45:18,325 --> 01:45:20,657
We can talk right here.

1140
01:45:29,269 --> 01:45:32,136
Good to see you up and about.

1141
01:45:32,206 --> 01:45:34,401
Didn't know if you'd make it.

1142
01:45:34,475 --> 01:45:36,170
How's the shoulder?

1143
01:45:36,243 --> 01:45:38,803
l'll live.

1144
01:45:38,879 --> 01:45:41,347
l don't suspect
anybody's said this to you,

1145
01:45:41,415 --> 01:45:45,875
but this country owes you
a huge debt.

1146
01:45:45,953 --> 01:45:50,151
You came all the way out here
just to tell me that?

1147
01:45:50,224 --> 01:45:51,816
Come on, Clayton.
l'm going someplace.

1148
01:45:51,892 --> 01:45:53,223
What do you want?

1149
01:45:55,596 --> 01:45:57,826
l've had your file wiped clean.

1150
01:45:57,898 --> 01:45:59,160
Everything.

1151
01:45:59,233 --> 01:46:01,758
The bombing at France,
the bus, all of it.

1152
01:46:01,835 --> 01:46:06,329
Effectively, you're a free man
but there's still a lot that you can do for us.

1153
01:46:06,407 --> 01:46:09,035
l'm a free man?

1154
01:46:09,109 --> 01:46:11,703
This doesn't feel like freedom
to me, Clayton.

1155
01:46:11,779 --> 01:46:13,838
You think because you hit ''delete''
on some computer somewhere

1156
01:46:13,914 --> 01:46:15,472
that that's it, it's over?

1157
01:46:15,549 --> 01:46:17,380
l made choices about people's lives.

1158
01:46:17,451 --> 01:46:18,884
- And l gotta live with that.
- l understand.

1159
01:46:18,952 --> 01:46:20,749
- Forever, Clayton.
- l understand that.

1160
01:46:20,821 --> 01:46:24,222
But you and l both know
that this fight is far from over.

1161
01:46:28,762 --> 01:46:31,560
You know, the Qur'an says
that if you kill an innocent person,

1162
01:46:31,632 --> 01:46:34,396
it's as if you've killed all mankind?

1163
01:46:36,537 --> 01:46:38,437
[sighs]

1164
01:46:38,505 --> 01:46:43,966
lt also says that if you save a life,
it's like you've saved all mankind.

1165
01:46:44,044 --> 01:46:46,376
You're a hero, Samir.

1166
01:46:50,284 --> 01:46:53,947
Look, whatever you want to call me,

1167
01:46:54,021 --> 01:46:55,682
l'm done.

1168
01:46:58,892 --> 01:47:01,258
Well, we know how to find each other.

1169
01:47:04,832 --> 01:47:06,265
<i>As-Salamu Alaykum.</i>

1170
01:47:09,770 --> 01:47:11,431
<i>Wa alaikum assalam.</i>

1171
01:47:15,876 --> 01:47:18,845
And you should start
the conversation with that.

1172
01:49:40,921 --> 01:49:43,913
