greetings from roNy

00:00:39,777 --> 00:00:42,302
<i>"Winner, winner, chicken dinner."</i>

3
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:47,072
<i>Those words had been dancing
around my head all night.</i>

4
00:00:48,118 --> 00:00:50,450
<i>I mean, it's Vegas lore, that phrase.</i>

5
00:00:51,255 --> 00:00:54,656
<i>Just ask any of the old-time pit bosses,
they'll know.</i>

6
00:00:57,895 --> 00:01:02,332
<i>It was a Chinese dealer at Binion's
who was first credited with the line.</i>

7
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:06,069
<i>He would shout it every time
he dealt blackjack.</i>

8
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:09,628
<i>That was over 40 years ago,
and the words still catch.</i>

9
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:11,731
<i>Winner, winner, chicken dinner. There it is!</i>

10
00:01:11,842 --> 00:01:14,208
<i>"Winner, winner, chicken dinner."</i>

11
00:01:15,378 --> 00:01:16,811
<i>Yeah, try it.</i>

12
00:01:19,082 --> 00:01:22,074
<i>I had heard it at least 14 times that night.</i>

13
00:01:22,752 --> 00:01:24,310
<i>I couldn't lose.</i>

14
00:01:25,588 --> 00:01:28,489
<i>First of all, what I was doing wasn't illegal.</i>

15
00:01:28,658 --> 00:01:31,821
<i>There were certain institutions and people
that frowned upon it,</i>

16
00:01:31,928 --> 00:01:34,089
<i>but it's legal.</i>

17
00:01:34,197 --> 00:01:35,960
<i>And not everyone can do it.</i>

18
00:01:36,065 --> 00:01:38,226
<i>Just those with gifted minds.</i>

19
00:01:38,501 --> 00:01:40,366
<i>I have a gifted mind.</i>

20
00:01:40,903 --> 00:01:43,497
<i>That's what got me into all this mess.</i>

21
00:01:44,073 --> 00:01:49,101
<i>I was counting cards
and I was up over $640,000.</i>

22
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,972
<i>All right!
I'm just gonna have to split those tens.</i>

23
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:56,813
<i>- Splitting tens.
- Splitting tens again.</i>

24
00:01:56,919 --> 00:01:58,887
<i>Well, that's all right.
I've been winning and losing for years.</i>

25
00:01:58,988 --> 00:02:00,979
<i>We used hand signals, too.</i>

26
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:03,251
<i>Folded arms, the table's hot.</i>

27
00:02:03,793 --> 00:02:06,819
<i>A touch to the eye, we need to talk.</i>

28
00:02:07,597 --> 00:02:12,694
<i>And a hand running through
perfect flowing hair meant only one thing.</i>

29
00:02:13,369 --> 00:02:15,030
<i>Get out. Now.</i>

30
00:02:25,348 --> 00:02:28,373
<i>"Winner, winner, chicken dinner."</i>

31
00:02:36,825 --> 00:02:41,489
Stroke. Stroke. Stroke. Stroke.

32
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:06,299
Premed.

33
00:05:07,273 --> 00:05:08,831
4.0 GPA.

34
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:11,000
44 MCATs.

35
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:13,902
President, American Legion Math League.

36
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:16,379
TA to Professors Wilkins and Sanders.

37
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:19,747
Both of whom are friends of mine,
and who wrote glowing recommendations.

38
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:22,878
And you're accepted early into school here
at Harvard Med,

39
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,924
pending graduation from MIT.
It's very impressive.

40
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:26,992
Thank you.

41
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:30,324
The Robinson Scholarship
is comprehensive, as you know.

42
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,866
It's a free ride.
And free rides don't come easy.

43
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:34,956
Absolutely.

44
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:40,165
We have 76 applicants this year,
only one of whom will get the scholarship

45
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:43,868
and most of whom have résumés
just as impressive as yours.

46
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:45,971
Right.

47
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:48,741
Professor Phillips?

48
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:52,951
Some kids grow up
wanting to play for the Red Sox.

49
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:57,011
You know, some grow up wanting to be,
I don't know, a fireman.

50
00:05:57,557 --> 00:06:02,516
I grew up... Well, really,
I just wanted to come here to Harvard Med.

51
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:09,226
And now that I've gotten accepted,
it seems to only come down to the money.

52
00:06:09,868 --> 00:06:12,393
Which I don't really have.

53
00:06:14,773 --> 00:06:18,402
So, what I'm trying to say

54
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:22,844
is that I really, really need this scholarship.

55
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:27,279
Did you rehearse that?

56
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:30,753
Yeah. Like, 14 times in front of the mirror.

57
00:06:32,424 --> 00:06:35,791
Unfortunately,
desire doesn't figure into this much.

58
00:06:36,194 --> 00:06:41,029
The Robinson is going
to go to someone who

59
00:06:42,534 --> 00:06:43,796
dazzles.

60
00:06:44,936 --> 00:06:48,428
Somebody who just jumps off the page.

61
00:06:48,974 --> 00:06:53,343
Oh, well, then, I'm also involved
in a science competition.

62
00:06:53,445 --> 00:06:55,174
We're building a robotic wheel

63
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,478
that can navigate itself
using a proprietary GPS system.

64
00:07:01,286 --> 00:07:03,686
Well, I'm designing the system. So...

65
00:07:03,789 --> 00:07:04,915
Right.

66
00:07:05,457 --> 00:07:08,857
Ben, last year,
the Robinson went to Hyum Jae Wook,

67
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:11,928
a Korean immigrant who has only one leg.

68
00:07:13,397 --> 00:07:16,127
Well, I have both my legs.

69
00:07:16,233 --> 00:07:19,361
Well, have you considered
cutting one of them off?

70
00:07:20,671 --> 00:07:22,229
That was a joke.

71
00:07:23,674 --> 00:07:25,141
Ben, it's all about the essay.

72
00:07:25,242 --> 00:07:28,234
You need to really explain to us
what makes you special.

73
00:07:28,346 --> 00:07:31,679
What life experience separates you
from all the rest.

74
00:07:32,683 --> 00:07:34,275
Life experience.

75
00:07:34,852 --> 00:07:37,082
What can you tell me, Ben,

76
00:07:37,188 --> 00:07:39,816
that's going to dazzle me?

77
00:08:04,648 --> 00:08:05,672
I'm so sorry I'm late.

78
00:08:05,783 --> 00:08:09,048
- Where is your jacket?
- Oh, I got it. I got it. It's right here.

79
00:08:09,153 --> 00:08:12,714
This is no way for the new
assistant manager to come to work.

80
00:08:12,823 --> 00:08:16,224
Congratulations.
How does $8 an hour sound?

81
00:08:16,327 --> 00:08:17,794
Eight dollars?

82
00:08:18,329 --> 00:08:23,163
Wow! Wow. That's great, Warren.
Thank you. Thank you.

83
00:08:24,834 --> 00:08:27,064
You slept with him, didn't you?

84
00:08:27,637 --> 00:08:30,128
- Yes, I did. Yes, I did.
- Yes, you did.

85
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,868
I'll sleep with him, too,
and I'll get $8 an hour.

86
00:08:32,976 --> 00:08:36,104
So Palmer finishes up his lecture, right?
And I say to him,

87
00:08:36,212 --> 00:08:39,943
"Well, Professor Palmer, you're gonna need
at least 14 capacitance probes

88
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:42,142
"to get the kind of results
that you're looking for," okay?

89
00:08:42,252 --> 00:08:46,188
So then he says to me, "Miles,
don't you think that's a little excessive?"

90
00:08:46,289 --> 00:08:51,386
And I get up, I swear to God, Ben, I get up
in front of the entire class and I say,

91
00:08:51,494 --> 00:08:54,759
"You can never have
enough capacitance probes."

92
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,665
Oh, my God.
What the hell is wrong with you?

93
00:09:02,138 --> 00:09:03,503
Oh, nothing.

94
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:07,107
I hope nothing. You just got promoted, man.
You should be happy.

95
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:12,341
I just gotta write this essay for the
Robinson Scholarship, and I have nothing.

96
00:09:13,383 --> 00:09:17,479
And the reason that I have nothing
is 'cause, well, I've done nothing.

97
00:09:17,587 --> 00:09:20,283
- Oh, give me a break, Ben.
- What?

98
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,119
You have everything.

99
00:09:22,525 --> 00:09:26,985
You blow me out of the water,
and I'm a cerebral stud. Is that nothing?

100
00:09:27,096 --> 00:09:28,358
Yeah, well, it doesn't dazzle.

101
00:09:28,465 --> 00:09:30,728
Hey. It dazzles me, mister.

102
00:09:31,433 --> 00:09:33,765
You know, ever since I was 16,
I crushed exams.

103
00:09:33,869 --> 00:09:37,236
I took on extracurriculars.
I showed up early.

104
00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:40,240
I even sat up at the front and I stayed late.

105
00:09:40,342 --> 00:09:42,310
Man, I gave up everything.

106
00:09:42,678 --> 00:09:45,078
You know, I gave up fun. I gave up sex.

107
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,841
I don't think you gave up sex.

108
00:09:46,949 --> 00:09:49,179
- Okay. Maybe not sex.
- Yeah, you didn't give up sex.

109
00:09:49,284 --> 00:09:50,979
All right, all right. Not sex, but...

110
00:09:51,086 --> 00:09:53,077
It just annoys me that the one thing

111
00:09:53,188 --> 00:09:56,123
that is stopping me
from going to Harvard Med is money.

112
00:09:56,225 --> 00:10:00,457
You know, tuition fees and living expenses
alone cost over $300,000.

113
00:10:01,296 --> 00:10:03,355
$300,000.

114
00:10:03,465 --> 00:10:06,764
It's outrageous. It's astronomically high.
I get that.

115
00:10:06,869 --> 00:10:10,771
You know, I just thought
there was more to life than just money.

116
00:10:13,175 --> 00:10:15,336
Well, look at the bright side,

117
00:10:15,844 --> 00:10:19,007
I just saved a bunch of money
on my car insurance.

118
00:10:29,258 --> 00:10:30,418
Thank you.

119
00:10:33,228 --> 00:10:35,287
- Happy birthday, honey.
- Thanks, Mom.

120
00:10:35,397 --> 00:10:36,694
Thank you, love. Kisses.

121
00:10:36,798 --> 00:10:38,026
Make a wish.

122
00:10:38,133 --> 00:10:39,430
- Make a wish.
- Okay.

123
00:10:41,369 --> 00:10:42,768
Bravo.

124
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,201
Congratulations, Benjamin.

125
00:10:44,305 --> 00:10:47,103
Did you know Miles did the frosting on that?
You see that?

126
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:50,371
It took me five minutes
to figure out it was a Fibonacci series...

127
00:10:50,478 --> 00:10:53,470
Where the next number is 21.
Now you're slipping, Cam.

128
00:10:53,581 --> 00:10:55,105
Cam, you owe another six bucks.

129
00:10:55,216 --> 00:10:56,843
No, no. I didn't eat any of the Buffalo wings.

130
00:10:56,951 --> 00:10:59,419
Oh, really? That's great.
Well, we're not doing it that way.

131
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,784
We're just dividing equally.
So let's say you pay.

132
00:11:01,889 --> 00:11:04,915
I got it, all right?
No, no. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.

133
00:11:05,026 --> 00:11:08,223
It's your birthday.
You're as broke-ass as I am.

134
00:11:08,329 --> 00:11:11,264
I just wish now
I had eaten some of those wings.

135
00:11:11,365 --> 00:11:14,732
So, I nailed the specs on the 2.09 last night,

136
00:11:14,835 --> 00:11:17,201
after 19 cups of coffee.

137
00:11:17,305 --> 00:11:20,331
- Check it out.
- You are kidding. You're kidding!

138
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:23,601
This is good. Miles, this is good.

139
00:11:23,711 --> 00:11:28,944
Yeah, well, it better be 'cause this is what
we've been working for since we got here.

140
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:30,381
This is called destiny.

141
00:11:30,484 --> 00:11:32,281
You know, there is the... Thank you.

142
00:11:32,386 --> 00:11:36,049
There is the possibility that
we might not actually win this thing.

143
00:11:36,157 --> 00:11:39,558
Oh, yeah?
Bite your tongue! Bite your damn tongue!

144
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,958
Look, guys,

145
00:11:44,098 --> 00:11:48,694
we don't date, we don't travel,
we don't have any money.

146
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:53,362
The only thing that we do have
is the 2.09 Competition.

147
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,809
If we can't even win that, what's the point?

148
00:11:59,346 --> 00:12:01,314
Hey, hey. Look at this!

149
00:12:01,848 --> 00:12:03,509
No, no, no, no.

150
00:12:09,155 --> 00:12:10,816
We suck.

151
00:12:17,664 --> 00:12:20,428
Your father would be so proud of you, Ben.

152
00:12:22,135 --> 00:12:23,227
Yeah.

153
00:12:25,138 --> 00:12:27,606
Do you remember anything about him?

154
00:12:29,042 --> 00:12:32,375
Not really. Maybe when he shaved?

155
00:12:33,246 --> 00:12:35,612
Yeah, I think I watched him shave.

156
00:12:37,884 --> 00:12:40,614
So, what are your plans
for the rest of the night?

157
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,451
I don't know. I'll probably just go back
and work on that essay.

158
00:12:44,557 --> 00:12:46,525
Ben, you're working too hard.

159
00:12:46,626 --> 00:12:51,325
Between the job and school and the 2.09,
you've had no time for just yourself.

160
00:12:51,898 --> 00:12:55,231
You have to squeeze in
a little time for fun, Ben.

161
00:12:55,335 --> 00:12:59,362
You only turn 21 once.
And it goes by very fast.

162
00:12:59,472 --> 00:13:01,702
Okay. All right.

163
00:13:03,475 --> 00:13:04,669
- Good night.
- All right, good night.

164
00:13:04,777 --> 00:13:07,644
- Don't come home before 3:00.
- All right.

165
00:13:12,518 --> 00:13:13,712
All right.

166
00:13:13,819 --> 00:13:18,415
Now, who can explain Newton's method
and how you use it?

167
00:13:19,425 --> 00:13:22,417
You can use it to solve nonlinear equations.

168
00:13:24,296 --> 00:13:27,754
That's impressive. That's really good.
I mean, I'm very impressed by that,

169
00:13:27,866 --> 00:13:31,358
especially since my class
is called Nonlinear Equations.

170
00:13:32,237 --> 00:13:35,695
All right, now somebody tell me something
I don't already know.

171
00:13:35,808 --> 00:13:36,934
Anyone?

172
00:13:37,042 --> 00:13:39,602
Bueller. Anyone? Bueller.

173
00:13:40,245 --> 00:13:41,837
Newton stole it.

174
00:13:42,848 --> 00:13:44,941
- I'm sorry?
- Newton stole it.

175
00:13:46,318 --> 00:13:50,220
Joseph Raphson published
this same method 50 years earlier.

176
00:13:50,889 --> 00:13:55,258
And if the start value is too far removed
from true zero, then it fails.

177
00:13:55,561 --> 00:13:59,156
- I'm sorry, what's your name?
- Ben. Ben Campbell.

178
00:13:59,264 --> 00:14:00,288
Ben.

179
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,232
So Ben Campbell suggests
that Joseph Raphson

180
00:14:03,335 --> 00:14:05,030
was the original author of this method.

181
00:14:05,137 --> 00:14:07,230
Well, if that's the case,
then why didn't he get any credit?

182
00:14:07,339 --> 00:14:10,570
Well, for one thing,
Newton had a better publicist.

183
00:14:10,776 --> 00:14:14,040
And for another, after 1700,
we know very little about Raphson

184
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:18,707
other than the fact that he discovered the
Kabbalah about 300 years before Madonna.

185
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:22,013
All right, now, let's give Ben a chance
for some extra credit, shall we?

186
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:26,523
We're gonna call this
the game show host problem, all right?

187
00:14:26,624 --> 00:14:28,649
Ben, suppose you're on a game show.

188
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,252
And you are given a chance to choose
from three different doors, all right?

189
00:14:32,363 --> 00:14:37,266
Now, behind one of the doors is a new car.
Behind the other two, goats.

190
00:14:37,368 --> 00:14:39,768
Which door would you choose, Ben?

191
00:14:40,204 --> 00:14:41,228
Door number one?

192
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:43,136
Door number one.
Ben chooses door number one.

193
00:14:43,241 --> 00:14:45,232
All right, now, the game show host,

194
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:48,312
who, by the way,
knows what's behind all the other doors,

195
00:14:48,412 --> 00:14:52,610
decides to open another door.
Let's say he chooses door number three.

196
00:14:52,784 --> 00:14:56,618
Behind which sits a goat. Now...

197
00:14:56,721 --> 00:14:58,518
Ben, game show host comes up to you.

198
00:14:58,623 --> 00:15:01,023
He says, "Ben, do you want to stay
with door number one

199
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:02,456
"or go with door number two?"

200
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,018
Now, is it in your interest
to switch your choice?

201
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:08,221
- Yeah.
- Well, wait.

202
00:15:08,332 --> 00:15:10,425
Remember, the host knows where the car is

203
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:12,969
so how do you know
he's not playing a trick on you?

204
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:15,937
Trying to use reverse psychology
to get you to pick a goat?

205
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:20,272
Well, I wouldn't really care.
I mean, my answer's based on statistics.

206
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:22,346
Based on variable change.

207
00:15:23,513 --> 00:15:25,879
Variable change?
But he just asked you a simple question.

208
00:15:25,982 --> 00:15:28,246
Yeah, which changed everything.

209
00:15:28,518 --> 00:15:29,883
Enlighten us.

210
00:15:29,986 --> 00:15:33,251
Well, when I was originally
asked to choose a door,

211
00:15:33,356 --> 00:15:36,814
I had a 33.3% chance of choosing right.

212
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,023
But after he opens one of the doors
and then re-offers me the choice,

213
00:15:41,131 --> 00:15:45,329
it's now 66.7% if I choose to switch.

214
00:15:45,435 --> 00:15:51,135
So, yeah, I'll take door number two,
and thank you for that extra 33.3%.

215
00:15:53,743 --> 00:15:54,869
Exactly.

216
00:15:54,978 --> 00:15:56,172
People, remember,

217
00:15:56,279 --> 00:16:00,511
if you don't know which door to open,
always account for variable change.

218
00:16:00,617 --> 00:16:02,710
Now, see, most people
wouldn't take the switch

219
00:16:02,819 --> 00:16:06,311
out of paranoia, fear, emotions.

220
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:09,324
But Mr. Campbell, he kept emotions aside

221
00:16:09,726 --> 00:16:16,256
and let simple math get his ass
into a brand-new car!

222
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,627
Which is better than that goat
you've been driving around campus.

223
00:16:19,736 --> 00:16:20,794
All right, everybody.

224
00:16:20,904 --> 00:16:22,303
That's the end of the day.
Thank you very much.

225
00:16:22,405 --> 00:16:23,963
Your graded papers are down here
at the end.

226
00:16:24,074 --> 00:16:26,599
You can pick them up on your way out.

227
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:38,680
I am invincible.

228
00:16:45,628 --> 00:16:48,119
Guys, Jill Taylor, 10 o'clock.

229
00:17:02,912 --> 00:17:04,743
Man. That's brutal.

230
00:17:07,016 --> 00:17:09,849
You know,
you should just ask her out, man.

231
00:17:09,952 --> 00:17:12,443
It's not like she's a rocket scientist
or anything.

232
00:17:12,554 --> 00:17:14,146
Oh, wait, she is.

233
00:17:14,256 --> 00:17:16,315
Well, why don't you ask her?

234
00:17:16,492 --> 00:17:20,087
Because I'm already dating someone.

235
00:17:20,496 --> 00:17:22,987
Yeah, your right hand doesn't count, Miles.

236
00:17:23,098 --> 00:17:26,397
It does the way I use it.
It does the way I use it.

237
00:17:28,137 --> 00:17:32,096
Hey, you know what?
Maybe I don't even want to go out with her.

238
00:17:33,842 --> 00:17:35,605
Yeah, that's funny.

239
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:40,544
You know, you say
you want a life experience, right?

240
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:45,249
Well, I'd say getting down with that
would definitely qualify.

241
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,248
Cam!

242
00:18:08,543 --> 00:18:09,942
Boy genius.

243
00:18:10,878 --> 00:18:12,869
You have to follow me now.

244
00:18:13,348 --> 00:18:15,942
- Excuse me?
- You have to follow me now.

245
00:18:16,985 --> 00:18:18,145
Come on.

246
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,526
- Where are we going?
- You'll see.

247
00:18:44,712 --> 00:18:46,407
Our honored guest.

248
00:18:48,449 --> 00:18:50,212
- How you doing, Ben?
- I'm okay.

249
00:18:50,318 --> 00:18:53,082
- You ever been in this room before?
- Yeah.

250
00:18:53,888 --> 00:18:56,185
Organic Chemistry in my freshman year.

251
00:18:56,289 --> 00:18:58,780
- How'd you do?
- Well, I got an A.

252
00:19:02,863 --> 00:19:04,956
- Professor Rosa...
- Micky, please.

253
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,965
Is there a problem with my paper?

254
00:19:08,068 --> 00:19:11,265
Well, you found a more efficient method
for finding true zero than Isaac Newton

255
00:19:11,371 --> 00:19:15,000
and that, my friend, is not so much of
a problem as it is a major ass-kicking.

256
00:19:15,108 --> 00:19:20,102
Although Newton has been dead for over
250 years, so it wasn't exactly a fair fight.

257
00:19:21,014 --> 00:19:23,574
So, is this some kind of a math club?

258
00:19:24,751 --> 00:19:26,514
Don't be rude, people.

259
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:29,214
- Kianna.
- Fisher.

260
00:19:29,322 --> 00:19:30,914
- Choi.
- Jill.

261
00:19:33,693 --> 00:19:37,857
- You ever studied blackjack?
- No.

262
00:19:38,265 --> 00:19:40,392
No, really? Well, it's really simple, actually.

263
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,593
You play against the dealer.

264
00:19:43,336 --> 00:19:44,860
You're given two cards.

265
00:19:44,971 --> 00:19:47,235
Face cards are worth 10 points.

266
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,399
The closest to 21 wins.

267
00:19:49,643 --> 00:19:53,374
If you go over, you lose.
If the dealer goes over, they lose.

268
00:19:54,815 --> 00:19:57,716
It's the most popular card game
in the world.

269
00:19:57,818 --> 00:19:59,046
It's a game with memory.

270
00:19:59,152 --> 00:20:01,848
Cards drawn are the past,
ones to come are future.

271
00:20:01,955 --> 00:20:04,685
And the best part, it's beatable.

272
00:20:06,959 --> 00:20:09,154
Are you talking about counting cards?

273
00:20:09,261 --> 00:20:13,857
No. I'm talking about getting very, very rich.

274
00:20:16,535 --> 00:20:19,527
You count cards, right? All of you?

275
00:20:19,638 --> 00:20:21,128
As a team, yes.

276
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,898
- When?
- Weekends. And Christian holidays.

277
00:20:26,278 --> 00:20:28,508
- Where?
- Vegas, baby.

278
00:20:30,216 --> 00:20:32,309
So, why are you telling me?

279
00:20:33,486 --> 00:20:36,250
Well, let's just say a spot opened up
on our roster.

280
00:20:36,355 --> 00:20:37,379
How?

281
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:40,081
Jimmy got a job at Google.

282
00:20:40,192 --> 00:20:43,628
- Jimmy got a job at Google?
- Yeah, it's catchy, I know.

283
00:20:43,863 --> 00:20:46,559
Well, if you're making so much money
at this, then why did he take it?

284
00:20:46,665 --> 00:20:48,963
Ben, I said Google, not Sizzler.

285
00:20:50,402 --> 00:20:52,063
Yeah... This is crazy.

286
00:20:52,171 --> 00:20:54,867
No, Ben. This is profitable.

287
00:20:57,643 --> 00:21:00,407
Yeah, I can't do it. So, I'm sorry.

288
00:21:00,513 --> 00:21:04,449
- Come on, Ben. It'll be fun.
- Yeah, Ben, it'll be fun.

289
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:06,108
No, it's not that. It's...

290
00:21:06,218 --> 00:21:11,155
I just got a promotion at my job,
so it's kind of not a good time for me.

291
00:21:11,257 --> 00:21:12,724
We pay better.

292
00:21:13,526 --> 00:21:16,154
Look, I can't just go to Vegas on weekends.

293
00:21:16,262 --> 00:21:19,890
Why not? MIT's on cruise control for you,
you've already gotten into Harvard Med.

294
00:21:19,998 --> 00:21:22,159
I mean, what do you have to worry about?

295
00:21:22,267 --> 00:21:26,328
- How did you know that?
- I like to take an interest in my students.

296
00:21:27,906 --> 00:21:31,967
Well, I'm also really involved
in the science competition.

297
00:21:32,343 --> 00:21:34,573
You know, the 2.09 Competition?

298
00:21:35,547 --> 00:21:38,778
Wait, no.
I'm building a car that drives by itself.

299
00:21:38,883 --> 00:21:41,716
Yeah, well, it's something I've been doing
with my friends for over a year,

300
00:21:41,819 --> 00:21:43,844
so it's kind of important.

301
00:21:43,955 --> 00:21:47,789
Ben, let the car drive by itself.

302
00:21:50,028 --> 00:21:55,989
Listen, you not only have a gifted mind,
but you're also composed.

303
00:21:57,268 --> 00:22:00,726
You don't give in to your emotions.
You think logically.

304
00:22:02,106 --> 00:22:05,007
Ben, you were born for this.

305
00:22:05,476 --> 00:22:08,206
You'll have more fun
than you've ever had in your entire life.

306
00:22:08,313 --> 00:22:09,712
It's perfect.

307
00:22:11,015 --> 00:22:15,418
Thank you. But I'm really not the right guy.

308
00:22:16,487 --> 00:22:17,920
So I'm sorry.

309
00:22:24,796 --> 00:22:25,922
Ben.

310
00:22:26,798 --> 00:22:29,664
I hope this little conversation
we just had will remain private.

311
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:31,461
- No, of...
- No.

312
00:22:32,102 --> 00:22:33,729
You're one of my favorite new students,

313
00:22:33,837 --> 00:22:37,068
and I'd hate to lose you,
if you know what I mean.

314
00:22:43,647 --> 00:22:45,979
- I'm just not sure it's me.
- It's boring.

315
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:48,916
It's boxy. It's blue. How is that not you?

316
00:22:49,553 --> 00:22:51,214
So, how much is this thing gonna run me?

317
00:22:51,321 --> 00:22:56,520
Oh, well, let's see, the belt's $49.95,
minus 15%.

318
00:22:56,627 --> 00:22:59,289
The jacket's $589.99.

319
00:22:59,396 --> 00:23:02,957
The pants, $285.99, minus 10% for both.

320
00:23:03,066 --> 00:23:07,332
Unfortunately, the shirt's not on sale,
but I can knock off 5% from the $69.99.

321
00:23:07,437 --> 00:23:09,564
The shoes were just marked down
from $155,

322
00:23:09,673 --> 00:23:15,236
so you're looking at $1,042.68.

323
00:23:18,448 --> 00:23:20,712
I'm pretty good with numbers.

324
00:23:21,918 --> 00:23:24,045
- Yeah.
- I guess so.

325
00:23:24,154 --> 00:23:26,452
Yeah, so let me know
when I can ring that up for you guys.

326
00:23:26,556 --> 00:23:27,691
- Yes. Thank you.
- Thanks.

327
00:23:27,691 --> 00:23:28,453
- Yes. Thank you.
- Thanks.

328
00:23:33,764 --> 00:23:34,788
Hey.

329
00:23:37,567 --> 00:23:38,590
Hey.

330
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:42,736
- Could you help me?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure.

331
00:23:43,539 --> 00:23:45,871
I'm looking for a tie.

332
00:23:45,975 --> 00:23:50,378
Oh, well, we're having a 15% sale
on the ties.

333
00:23:51,614 --> 00:23:55,106
And if you want,
I could probably get you an additional 10%

334
00:23:55,217 --> 00:23:57,242
with my employee discount.

335
00:23:58,387 --> 00:24:00,855
- This one's nice.
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

336
00:24:02,391 --> 00:24:07,556
This one has actually been treated with
our patented Nano-Tex fabric protection,

337
00:24:07,663 --> 00:24:11,724
you know, to repel liquids and stains.

338
00:24:11,834 --> 00:24:16,362
- Well, that's really functional.
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's pretty functional.

339
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,007
Face me. Stay still.

340
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:24,410
Despite being tempted
by the Nano-Tex repellant,

341
00:24:26,082 --> 00:24:30,075
I'm actually not here for a tie, Ben.

342
00:24:32,655 --> 00:24:34,282
I came to see you.

343
00:24:35,591 --> 00:24:36,785
You did?

344
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:40,392
Blackjack's a great game.

345
00:24:40,496 --> 00:24:42,123
No, look, it's easy to learn

346
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:46,031
and there's really not as much strategy to it
as people think.

347
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:48,226
I grew up on it, actually.

348
00:24:48,838 --> 00:24:51,772
- You grew up on it?
- Yeah.

349
00:24:52,807 --> 00:24:56,106
Every night after dinner,
my father and I would play.

350
00:24:56,344 --> 00:24:59,836
I knew basic strategy
before I was, like, nine years old.

351
00:25:00,882 --> 00:25:03,442
If I won, he'd take me out for ice cream.

352
00:25:03,551 --> 00:25:05,416
And what if he won?

353
00:25:07,555 --> 00:25:09,045
He'd still take me out for ice cream.

354
00:25:09,157 --> 00:25:12,490
Oh, yeah. Sure, yeah, he's your dad.

355
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:17,861
Ben, you should feel the thrill

356
00:25:18,366 --> 00:25:22,063
of winning more money
than you can possibly imagine.

357
00:25:28,076 --> 00:25:30,306
I think you should come to Vegas.

358
00:25:30,412 --> 00:25:34,815
'Cause I'm guessing that you could
probably use a break from this place.

359
00:25:40,555 --> 00:25:41,749
I can't.

360
00:25:42,557 --> 00:25:43,956
I'm sorry.

361
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:46,492
I just can't.

362
00:25:48,229 --> 00:25:52,063
Okay. If you change your mind,
you know where we meet.

363
00:25:52,767 --> 00:25:53,927
Yeah.

364
00:25:54,702 --> 00:25:56,567
You're welcome any time.

365
00:26:01,575 --> 00:26:04,442
You know,
I think the best thing about Vegas

366
00:26:05,145 --> 00:26:07,613
is you can become anyone you want.

367
00:26:37,144 --> 00:26:38,338
- What's the count?
- Plus 9.

368
00:26:38,445 --> 00:26:39,412
- No.
- Plus 11.

369
00:26:39,513 --> 00:26:40,502
No.

370
00:26:40,814 --> 00:26:43,647
- Dude, I lost count 20 cards ago.
- Don't call me "dude."

371
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:45,149
- Plus 9?
- You're just following Jill.

372
00:26:45,252 --> 00:26:48,415
People, please. We had a total of 76 cards
that came out of the deck.

373
00:26:48,522 --> 00:26:50,649
Twenty-three were high cards
with a value of minus one.

374
00:26:50,757 --> 00:26:52,850
Seventeen were neutral with no value at all,

375
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,689
and the rest were low cards
with a value of plus one.

376
00:26:54,795 --> 00:26:57,423
- How could you lose the count?
- Plus 13.

377
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:02,460
The count. It's plus 13.

378
00:27:05,939 --> 00:27:07,031
Yes.

379
00:27:08,208 --> 00:27:09,800
Pull up a chair.

380
00:27:17,483 --> 00:27:18,575
Stop.

381
00:27:19,352 --> 00:27:22,116
- What is it?
- Plus 12. Eggs.

382
00:27:22,221 --> 00:27:24,189
<i>Twelve eggs in a carton.</i>

383
00:27:24,524 --> 00:27:26,583
- Now what?
- Plus 9.

384
00:27:26,692 --> 00:27:27,750
<i>Cats have nine lives.</i>

385
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:28,827
Cat.

386
00:27:30,296 --> 00:27:31,661
<i>Sweet 16.</i>

387
00:27:31,931 --> 00:27:34,024
<i>Every card had a value.</i>

388
00:27:34,133 --> 00:27:38,229
<i>A high card, minus one.
A low card, plus one.</i>

389
00:27:38,337 --> 00:27:39,827
<i>The rest, zero.</i>

390
00:27:39,939 --> 00:27:43,204
Plus 13. Plus 8. Plus 9. Plus 12.

391
00:27:44,544 --> 00:27:47,012
<i>I was studying all day, every day.</i>

392
00:27:47,113 --> 00:27:51,573
<i>But it wasn't physics, chemistry
and engineering. I was back to simple math,</i>

393
00:27:51,684 --> 00:27:54,744
<i>used in ways I could never have imagined.</i>

394
00:27:56,722 --> 00:27:58,519
<i>The team had a system.</i>

395
00:27:58,891 --> 00:28:02,292
<i>And to go unnoticed,
we created a whole new language.</i>

396
00:28:03,563 --> 00:28:06,657
<i>Words were numbers,
and numbers were words.</i>

397
00:28:06,933 --> 00:28:08,400
- Plus 17.
- Magazine.

398
00:28:08,501 --> 00:28:09,525
- Plus 6.
- Gun.

399
00:28:09,635 --> 00:28:11,432
- Plus 15.
- Paycheck.

400
00:28:11,771 --> 00:28:13,033
Plus 12.

401
00:28:13,139 --> 00:28:15,232
Is this chemistry review?

402
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:21,636
- Plus 14.
- Ring.

403
00:28:21,746 --> 00:28:22,872
- Plus 16.
- Sweet.

404
00:28:22,981 --> 00:28:24,346
Use it in a sentence.

405
00:28:24,449 --> 00:28:26,713
Man, that sugar's sweet.

406
00:28:28,286 --> 00:28:31,915
<i>Because I knew the count,
I knew which cards were left in the deck.</i>

407
00:28:32,023 --> 00:28:33,547
<i>That's how I knew what to bet.</i>

408
00:28:33,658 --> 00:28:35,353
You're doing great.

409
00:28:36,728 --> 00:28:41,427
Micky, I just want to let you know
that I'm only doing this for medical school,

410
00:28:41,533 --> 00:28:43,558
which is $300,000.

411
00:28:43,668 --> 00:28:47,331
I mean, if I can get anything close to that,
then I'm done.

412
00:28:47,606 --> 00:28:50,871
Well, in the first place, Ben,
it's not "if," it's "when."

413
00:28:50,976 --> 00:28:53,638
And second of all,
I get it. I completely understand.

414
00:28:53,745 --> 00:28:56,373
- You do?
- Yeah. It's a means to an end.

415
00:28:56,481 --> 00:28:59,746
Look, they've got this new computer
software that reads people's faces,

416
00:28:59,851 --> 00:29:03,218
so who knows how long this gig's
gonna last for any of us?

417
00:29:03,321 --> 00:29:05,050
What if we get caught?

418
00:29:05,156 --> 00:29:08,216
Our system keeps us under the radar,
you'll see.

419
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,988
Anyway, counting cards isn't illegal.

420
00:29:11,896 --> 00:29:16,356
- So, there's no danger in it at all?
- No, Ben, it's safe. Very safe.

421
00:29:20,271 --> 00:29:22,637
You think you can beat the system?

422
00:29:23,575 --> 00:29:27,409
This is the system, beating you back.

423
00:29:30,181 --> 00:29:33,308
You wanna count cards,
you do it in Atlantic City.

424
00:29:35,452 --> 00:29:37,716
- Get him up.
- Come on, kid.

425
00:29:37,821 --> 00:29:39,379
Count to five.

426
00:29:40,524 --> 00:29:43,186
- Count to five!
- What?

427
00:29:43,494 --> 00:29:46,930
Count to five so I know you don't have
brain damage, you can go home.

428
00:29:47,031 --> 00:29:48,157
Start with one.

429
00:29:48,265 --> 00:29:50,859
One, two, three, four, five.

430
00:29:50,968 --> 00:29:55,166
Good. Now, stop counting.

431
00:29:58,842 --> 00:30:00,070
Let's go.

432
00:30:04,281 --> 00:30:06,215
<i>You're crazy,
everybody knows to split eights.</i>

433
00:30:06,316 --> 00:30:07,374
<i>My grandmother splits eights.</i>

434
00:30:07,484 --> 00:30:10,044
Not against a 10. It's a sucker play.

435
00:30:10,154 --> 00:30:11,781
Look, you're choosing to play two hands

436
00:30:11,889 --> 00:30:14,414
against the highest up card
a dealer can have, right?

437
00:30:14,525 --> 00:30:16,550
Against a five or a six, it'd be fine.

438
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:18,719
Against a 10 or an ace, it's a sucker play.

439
00:30:18,829 --> 00:30:21,457
Yeah, Kianna, save it, all right?
Jill's right. All right?

440
00:30:21,565 --> 00:30:23,863
Choi, why don't you explain to Ben
how we do?

441
00:30:23,967 --> 00:30:25,332
Oh, all right.

442
00:30:25,436 --> 00:30:28,872
So, our team is divided
into two kinds of players,

443
00:30:28,972 --> 00:30:30,701
spotters and big players, right?

444
00:30:30,808 --> 00:30:34,266
So if you think that this table
is the casino floor,

445
00:30:35,913 --> 00:30:38,177
then salt and pepper shakers
are your spotters.

446
00:30:38,282 --> 00:30:41,080
Spotters are just sitting
at the various blackjack tables

447
00:30:41,185 --> 00:30:44,517
and they're betting the table minimum.
They never fluctuate their bet.

448
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:47,612
That's right. Spotters never raise the bet
or play any kind of progressive system.

449
00:30:47,724 --> 00:30:50,454
That's how we stay under the radar,
and that's why we never get caught.

450
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:53,620
Exactly. Okay, they're just sitting
at the table, betting the table min,

451
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:56,290
and they're keeping the count
waiting for one of these decks to get hot.

452
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:58,128
Right. And then when one of the decks
gets hot,

453
00:30:58,234 --> 00:31:00,725
the spotter at that table signals
in the big player.

454
00:31:00,837 --> 00:31:03,271
This... Mustard.
Give me the mustard, honey. Please.

455
00:31:03,372 --> 00:31:05,431
Well, I'm always the mustard, so...

456
00:31:05,541 --> 00:31:09,705
When I get the signal for the hot deck,
I stumble over like some drunk rich kid,

457
00:31:09,812 --> 00:31:13,714
or some zoned out dot-com millionaire,
and I throw down big money.

458
00:31:13,816 --> 00:31:16,512
So the big player bets big
and still keeps the count.

459
00:31:16,619 --> 00:31:18,814
When the deck cools, he cashes in.

460
00:31:18,921 --> 00:31:20,411
It's not as easy as it sounds.

461
00:31:20,523 --> 00:31:21,956
Oh, yeah, it's not, you know,

462
00:31:22,058 --> 00:31:24,686
because if Grey Poupon over here
ever loses the count,

463
00:31:24,794 --> 00:31:27,627
it's up to his table's spotter
to give him the signal to get out.

464
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:30,324
- And you know the signals, right?
- Yeah.

465
00:31:30,566 --> 00:31:31,624
Show us.

466
00:31:31,734 --> 00:31:33,133
Okay, what's this?

467
00:31:33,236 --> 00:31:35,636
- The deck's hot.
- Right.

468
00:31:35,738 --> 00:31:37,603
We need to talk.

469
00:31:38,608 --> 00:31:40,269
The deck's cooling.

470
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:43,537
And get out. Get out now.

471
00:31:45,214 --> 00:31:49,344
Good. I think he's gonna be ready
for our little trial run tomorrow.

472
00:31:50,553 --> 00:31:52,316
There's a trial run?

473
00:31:53,054 --> 00:31:55,716
- Where?
- You'll find out.

474
00:32:46,741 --> 00:32:47,867
Hey.

475
00:33:05,559 --> 00:33:07,356
- You Ben?
- Yeah.

476
00:33:07,728 --> 00:33:09,025
Follow me.

477
00:33:17,304 --> 00:33:18,566
This way.

478
00:33:26,013 --> 00:33:28,208
Go, go. You go.

479
00:33:42,429 --> 00:33:45,193
No more bet. No more bet.

480
00:33:50,671 --> 00:33:52,229
Come on, money.

481
00:33:52,339 --> 00:33:54,136
Today, 14.

482
00:33:54,241 --> 00:33:56,004
Whose side are you on?

483
00:34:04,385 --> 00:34:05,545
Sixteen.

484
00:34:05,653 --> 00:34:07,746
Thank you. Sorry, gentlemen.

485
00:34:10,357 --> 00:34:13,520
So, Henry, did I tell you I read
about this place in a magazine?

486
00:34:22,502 --> 00:34:25,994
- You wanna put that money down?
- Yeah. $300.

487
00:34:26,205 --> 00:34:27,365
$300.

488
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:38,810
$300.

489
00:34:40,086 --> 00:34:41,553
You bet, sir?

490
00:34:43,423 --> 00:34:44,685
Thanks.

491
00:35:04,277 --> 00:35:06,507
Winner, winner, chicken dinner.

492
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:10,581
"Winner, winner, chicken dinner." All right.

493
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:14,915
Nice.

494
00:35:19,058 --> 00:35:21,356
Can I get another drink, please?

495
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:22,958
Thank you.

496
00:35:25,731 --> 00:35:27,562
What the hell are you doing?

497
00:35:27,666 --> 00:35:30,794
What are you doing?
I haven't done anything! Get off me!

498
00:35:30,902 --> 00:35:32,529
Get off, I haven't done anything!

499
00:35:34,606 --> 00:35:36,267
Please. Please let go.

500
00:35:36,375 --> 00:35:38,172
- What's the count?
- Please don't hurt me.

501
00:35:38,276 --> 00:35:40,642
- I said, what's the count?
- Look, I haven't even done anything!

502
00:35:40,746 --> 00:35:42,304
What's the count?

503
00:35:44,816 --> 00:35:46,408
Plus 18.

504
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:53,248
Oh, you've gotta be kidding.

505
00:35:53,358 --> 00:35:54,518
Congratulations, Ben.

506
00:35:54,626 --> 00:35:56,856
Sorry, we had to make sure
you'd keep the count under pressure.

507
00:35:56,962 --> 00:35:58,725
Welcome to the team.

508
00:36:00,198 --> 00:36:01,426
We didn't mean it.

509
00:36:01,533 --> 00:36:04,468
It's okay, Campbell, I cried inside that bag.

510
00:36:12,844 --> 00:36:16,041
Fisher and Jimmy
have always been the big players.

511
00:36:16,148 --> 00:36:18,446
I want you to take Jimmy's place.

512
00:36:19,618 --> 00:36:20,983
I've never done this.

513
00:36:21,086 --> 00:36:22,314
I know that and I understand.

514
00:36:22,421 --> 00:36:25,549
But I don't trust the girls,
and Choi is, well, Choi.

515
00:36:25,657 --> 00:36:27,818
Look, I've been teaching
for more than 14 years,

516
00:36:27,926 --> 00:36:29,723
and I've never had a student
as impressive as you.

517
00:36:29,828 --> 00:36:32,058
Your brain is like a goddamn Pentium chip.

518
00:36:32,164 --> 00:36:34,689
You're gonna do great.
You know how I know that?

519
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,632
'Cause you remind me of myself
25 years ago.

520
00:36:38,869 --> 00:36:40,029
You in?

521
00:36:41,238 --> 00:36:44,639
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm in.
- Good. Good.

522
00:36:45,509 --> 00:36:48,740
There's one more thing, Ben,
and this is important.

523
00:36:51,582 --> 00:36:54,346
We're counting cards, we're not gambling.

524
00:36:54,585 --> 00:36:57,679
We're following a specific set of rules
and playing a system.

525
00:36:57,788 --> 00:36:58,777
Right.

526
00:36:58,889 --> 00:37:00,914
I've seen how crazy
it can get at those tables,

527
00:37:01,025 --> 00:37:03,926
and sometimes, people lose control.

528
00:37:04,361 --> 00:37:06,522
They give in to their emotions.

529
00:37:07,798 --> 00:37:09,231
You will not.

530
00:37:10,468 --> 00:37:11,992
You understand?

531
00:37:13,137 --> 00:37:14,161
Yeah.

532
00:37:15,606 --> 00:37:17,073
Get some rest.

533
00:37:17,708 --> 00:37:19,733
- Some rest?
- Yeah, we're leaving tomorrow.

534
00:37:19,844 --> 00:37:23,473
Tomorrow? I have a Quantitative Literacy
paper due Tuesday.

535
00:37:23,914 --> 00:37:26,007
- No, you don't.
- I don't?

536
00:37:26,117 --> 00:37:27,982
No, I spoke to Professor O'Reilly.

537
00:37:28,085 --> 00:37:30,246
I told him you were helping me
with a special assignment,

538
00:37:30,354 --> 00:37:32,982
and he understood, so he gave you an A.

539
00:37:34,191 --> 00:37:37,683
You see, Ben, amazing things
can happen from the inside.

540
00:37:37,795 --> 00:37:40,389
You'll get a call about details later.

541
00:37:43,134 --> 00:37:44,567
So did the girls go on ahead, huh?

542
00:37:44,668 --> 00:37:46,999
Oh, yeah. They got a lot more bags
to check, you know?

543
00:37:47,103 --> 00:37:48,161
Okay.

544
00:37:48,271 --> 00:37:51,172
Well, wait for us by security
'cause Ben and I are gonna hit the head.

545
00:37:51,274 --> 00:37:52,366
No, I'm good.

546
00:37:52,475 --> 00:37:54,807
No, I really think you should go.
It's a long flight.

547
00:37:54,911 --> 00:37:57,778
- No, I'm okay.
- We're going to the bathroom.

548
00:38:00,917 --> 00:38:02,646
Honestly, I really don't have to go.

549
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:05,152
- I don't care what you have to do.
- Look, I really don't have to...

550
00:38:05,255 --> 00:38:06,313
Please just shut up.

551
00:38:06,422 --> 00:38:08,652
Why are you looking over there?
Look, I don't...

552
00:38:08,758 --> 00:38:10,851
I don't care. Shut up. Get in here.

553
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,155
- What are you doing?
- Let's go.

554
00:38:14,364 --> 00:38:16,594
- Pull down your pants.
- What?

555
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,329
Don't ask questions.

556
00:38:22,038 --> 00:38:24,165
- Shove these in your underwear.
- Why?

557
00:38:24,274 --> 00:38:27,607
You want me to do it?
'Cause, I swear to God, I will.

558
00:38:29,379 --> 00:38:32,439
- Why can't we leave it in the bag?
- Because it shows up on the scanner.

559
00:38:32,549 --> 00:38:34,676
And we're not about
to have them confiscate $250,000.

560
00:38:34,784 --> 00:38:36,513
$250,000?

561
00:38:36,953 --> 00:38:40,582
- No. Why do I have to do it?
- 'Cause you're the donkey boy.

562
00:38:41,224 --> 00:38:43,886
You really suck at not asking questions.

563
00:38:48,198 --> 00:38:49,927
What's a donkey boy?

564
00:38:51,534 --> 00:38:53,832
- Step forward, sir.
- Thanks.

565
00:38:55,271 --> 00:38:58,000
- In the basket, please.
- There's a table when you get to the line.

566
00:38:58,106 --> 00:39:01,735
Act casual, think casual, be casual.

567
00:39:01,843 --> 00:39:04,539
Remove your keys, any metal objects.
Laptops out, please.

568
00:39:04,646 --> 00:39:05,977
Thank you.

569
00:39:07,449 --> 00:39:11,545
If you have liquids in a Ziploc bag,
please show them to us now.

570
00:39:11,653 --> 00:39:13,712
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

571
00:39:42,017 --> 00:39:43,006
Your boarding pass.

572
00:39:57,032 --> 00:39:58,056
Sir?

573
00:40:10,678 --> 00:40:12,407
You forgot your bag.

574
00:40:14,915 --> 00:40:16,212
Thanks.

575
00:42:15,802 --> 00:42:17,463
Nice going, Campbell.

576
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:22,234
Hey, Ben.
Basic strategy says you should hit that.

577
00:42:33,752 --> 00:42:37,449
Burt, Moishe, Vladimir,

578
00:42:37,556 --> 00:42:40,753
Mona, Miss Sommers,
your new identities are on the bar.

579
00:42:40,859 --> 00:42:42,850
So glad you could make it.

580
00:42:43,095 --> 00:42:44,960
Vladimir Stupnitsky?

581
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:47,361
Yeah. Your dad's a diplomat
with the Russian consulate.

582
00:42:47,466 --> 00:42:48,626
You live in Washington, D.C.

583
00:42:48,734 --> 00:42:52,500
Your hobbies are backgammon, chess
and long walks on the beach.

584
00:42:52,604 --> 00:42:54,868
- I don't like my name.
- Why not?

585
00:42:55,474 --> 00:42:58,068
"Sierra Sommers." Do I look like a Sierra?

586
00:42:58,177 --> 00:43:00,372
Well, you have a lot of clever outfits.
You'll figure it out.

587
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:03,642
Just pretend you don't speak English.
Then you don't have to change your hair.

588
00:43:03,749 --> 00:43:06,946
You know, I thought this was legal.
Why do we have to use fake names?

589
00:43:07,052 --> 00:43:09,282
Well, it is. We not only use fake names,
we use disguises.

590
00:43:09,388 --> 00:43:12,084
It's for the benefit of the dealers
to make sure you're old enough to gamble

591
00:43:12,191 --> 00:43:14,455
and it allows everyone to be different people
in different casinos.

592
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:18,587
Hey! You steal the Bible, you go to hell.
That's the way it works.

593
00:43:19,031 --> 00:43:20,396
Like I'm not going already.

594
00:43:20,499 --> 00:43:21,591
Yeah. All right. Now, listen.

595
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:24,635
Ben, this is for you.
All the casinos have cameras in the ceiling.

596
00:43:24,736 --> 00:43:26,101
They're called "eyes in the sky."

597
00:43:26,205 --> 00:43:29,140
For their benefit, order a tonic water
and lime and act a little drunk,

598
00:43:29,241 --> 00:43:31,732
and at all times, you don't know each other.

599
00:43:31,844 --> 00:43:36,144
Let me say that one more time,
you do not know each other ever.

600
00:43:37,382 --> 00:43:38,474
And what's our motto?

601
00:43:38,584 --> 00:43:40,517
- Don't get caught counting.
- Don't get caught counting.

602
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:42,313
Thank you very much.

603
00:43:43,387 --> 00:43:44,945
How come you don't play?

604
00:43:45,056 --> 00:43:48,253
Oh, I did. I played for a long time
and I was the best. But I'm retired now.

605
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:51,260
Take my advice, Ben, it's always best
to go out when you're on top.

606
00:43:51,362 --> 00:43:52,954
Welcome to Vegas.

607
00:44:03,207 --> 00:44:04,333
No more bets.

608
00:44:04,442 --> 00:44:06,273
All right, here we go.
Big money, now. Big money.

609
00:44:06,377 --> 00:44:09,437
Let me tell you about blackjack, honey.
You ever hear of basic strategy?

610
00:44:09,547 --> 00:44:12,277
Oh, see,
now that sounds really complicated.

611
00:44:12,383 --> 00:44:14,544
- I'm Sierra Sommers from Charleston.
- Pleasure.

612
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:17,314
Here to double my family's inheritance.

613
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:20,580
I don't know.

614
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:41,811
$10,000.

615
00:44:42,813 --> 00:44:44,713
Changing $10,000.

616
00:44:44,815 --> 00:44:46,680
Sweet. Too sweet.

617
00:45:07,370 --> 00:45:09,964
<i>Eight. The count's still plus 16.</i>

618
00:45:11,575 --> 00:45:13,543
<i>Ten. That's minus one.</i>

619
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:15,504
<i>Count's plus 15.</i>

620
00:45:16,913 --> 00:45:19,507
<i>Eight. Still plus 15.</i>

621
00:45:21,084 --> 00:45:23,052
<i>Nine. Plus 15.</i>

622
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:27,683
<i>Five. The count's 16.</i>

623
00:45:29,326 --> 00:45:31,089
<i>Eights. Split eights.</i>

624
00:45:31,394 --> 00:45:32,418
Can I split those?

625
00:45:32,529 --> 00:45:35,521
- Sir, please don't touch the cards.
- I'm sorry.

626
00:45:42,739 --> 00:45:45,264
<i>Jack. Count's plus 15.</i>

627
00:45:48,645 --> 00:45:51,011
<i>Ten. Plus 14.</i>

628
00:45:57,220 --> 00:46:00,087
<i>King. Nine. Plus 13.</i>

629
00:46:07,096 --> 00:46:08,586
<i>Jack. Plus 12.</i>

630
00:46:09,632 --> 00:46:11,657
<i>Nine. Still plus 12.</i>

631
00:46:12,134 --> 00:46:13,499
<i>Blackjack.</i>

632
00:46:59,314 --> 00:47:00,713
Monkey! Monkey!

633
00:47:00,816 --> 00:47:02,716
- So what's a monkey?
- Face card.

634
00:47:02,818 --> 00:47:06,219
All right, face card.
Come on, monkey. Okay, monkey.

635
00:47:09,758 --> 00:47:10,918
Monkey!

636
00:47:11,293 --> 00:47:12,691
Monkey! Come on, give us a monkey!

637
00:47:12,794 --> 00:47:15,957
Monkey! Come on, monkey,
monkey, monkey! Monkey.

638
00:47:16,064 --> 00:47:17,554
Monkey! Monkey!

639
00:47:20,868 --> 00:47:22,733
All right, all right.

640
00:47:26,274 --> 00:47:28,469
Oh, God.

641
00:47:29,610 --> 00:47:31,134
I need to quit.

642
00:47:36,017 --> 00:47:38,110
Could I color up, please?

643
00:48:21,028 --> 00:48:22,393
Nice undies.

644
00:48:28,935 --> 00:48:30,960
- What's this?
- It's last night's take.

645
00:48:31,071 --> 00:48:32,902
We split it five ways.

646
00:48:38,145 --> 00:48:39,840
So, what do you think?

647
00:48:39,946 --> 00:48:41,573
Yeah, it was fun.

648
00:48:42,015 --> 00:48:43,482
- You were good.
- Really?

649
00:48:43,583 --> 00:48:47,019
Yeah. Came in quick off the count.
You acted the part.

650
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:51,079
You weren't afraid to play big, and
you got out when you were supposed to.

651
00:48:52,893 --> 00:48:55,384
And you made more money than Fisher.

652
00:48:55,662 --> 00:48:58,222
I was pretty nervous, actually.

653
00:48:58,865 --> 00:49:02,301
You know, but after a while,
it felt kind of easy.

654
00:49:04,104 --> 00:49:05,628
Not for everyone.

655
00:49:05,739 --> 00:49:07,866
Yeah, it's just simple math.

656
00:49:08,441 --> 00:49:11,342
Good.
We can do some serious damage with you.

657
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:19,082
Here's the thing I told Micky.

658
00:49:19,486 --> 00:49:23,684
You know, I'm only really doing this
just to pay for medical school.

659
00:49:23,790 --> 00:49:26,452
You know, $300,000 and then I'm out.

660
00:49:28,995 --> 00:49:31,122
That's what they all say.

661
00:49:31,898 --> 00:49:35,526
No, really, I mean, I'm just doing this
to pay for Harvard.

662
00:49:35,634 --> 00:49:38,102
It's just a means to an end for me.

663
00:49:39,972 --> 00:49:41,439
I believe you.

664
00:49:41,907 --> 00:49:42,999
Good.

665
00:49:53,219 --> 00:49:56,279
<i>- Hello?
- We have a team meeting in five minutes.</i>

666
00:49:58,090 --> 00:49:59,079
Team meeting.

667
00:49:59,558 --> 00:50:00,786
Hello?

668
00:50:00,893 --> 00:50:02,155
- Hey.
- Hey.

669
00:50:02,528 --> 00:50:03,995
Where's everybody else?

670
00:50:04,096 --> 00:50:06,860
I don't know. Fisher was right behind us.

671
00:50:10,836 --> 00:50:12,963
Oh, Fisher, you didn't sleep.

672
00:50:13,339 --> 00:50:17,799
- I did. With Ida.
- Ida?

673
00:50:18,310 --> 00:50:21,939
She's a dancer. I pulled her out of Sapphire.

674
00:50:22,481 --> 00:50:26,918
- And Ida's her dancer name?
- Yeah. After her grandmother.

675
00:50:27,953 --> 00:50:29,420
Where's Kianna?

676
00:50:29,722 --> 00:50:30,882
Slots.

677
00:50:32,157 --> 00:50:36,355
- Choi, where the hell you been?
- Unattended maid cart, ninth floor.

678
00:50:37,162 --> 00:50:39,392
I've been busy this morning.

679
00:50:42,801 --> 00:50:44,199
All right, guys, let's get something clear.

680
00:50:44,302 --> 00:50:46,532
This is not summer camp
and I'm not your counselor.

681
00:50:46,638 --> 00:50:49,038
This is real, world-class
moneymaking business.

682
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:51,131
Kianna, slots are for losers.

683
00:50:51,242 --> 00:50:53,403
Fisher, peelers are stealers.

684
00:50:53,711 --> 00:50:54,769
Choi?

685
00:50:55,079 --> 00:50:59,243
You made five grand last night,
so would you stop stealing nine-cent pens

686
00:50:59,350 --> 00:51:03,150
and everything you can get your hands on
from the maid's cart? It's embarrassing.

687
00:51:03,254 --> 00:51:07,315
But, Fisher,
what the hell were you up to last night?

688
00:51:07,692 --> 00:51:08,716
What?

689
00:51:08,826 --> 00:51:11,818
Three separate occasions, the spotters
let you know that the deck was cooling,

690
00:51:11,930 --> 00:51:13,124
but you kept on anyway.

691
00:51:13,231 --> 00:51:14,823
You either lost the count
or you lost your head.

692
00:51:14,933 --> 00:51:16,867
In either case,
I don't wanna see it happen again.

693
00:51:16,968 --> 00:51:18,833
Jill, nice disguise last night.

694
00:51:18,937 --> 00:51:23,601
And Ben, good work. You came out
of that chute like a pro. Keep it up.

695
00:51:24,676 --> 00:51:25,665
Beginner's luck.

696
00:51:25,777 --> 00:51:28,769
Hey, Fisher. Win like a man, lose like a man.

697
00:51:29,347 --> 00:51:31,406
Micky, I didn't play
into a cold deck three times.

698
00:51:31,516 --> 00:51:32,847
You know what's worse than a loser?

699
00:51:32,951 --> 00:51:36,182
Someone who won't admit
he played it wrong.

700
00:51:36,287 --> 00:51:38,152
Take it up with Ida.

701
00:51:39,357 --> 00:51:40,585
Who's Ida?

702
00:51:41,526 --> 00:51:43,084
- Who the hell is Ida?
- Shut up.

703
00:51:43,194 --> 00:51:45,185
- Who the hell is Ida?
- Shut up.

704
00:52:12,122 --> 00:52:14,113
There goes that paycheck.

705
00:52:22,065 --> 00:52:24,966
- Money plays.
- Money plays, up to the limit.

706
00:52:28,205 --> 00:52:30,139
How's she doing?

707
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:31,837
Oh, that doesn't matter, man.

708
00:52:31,942 --> 00:52:34,843
The way I see it, yesterday's history,
tomorrow's a mystery.

709
00:52:34,945 --> 00:52:37,743
It's all what you do in the moment, baby.

710
00:52:49,893 --> 00:52:51,952
Just lost another property.

711
00:52:53,030 --> 00:52:56,431
- Who is it this time, Caesars or the Mirage?
- Caesars.

712
00:52:58,035 --> 00:53:00,094
That was a 14-year account.

713
00:53:00,437 --> 00:53:04,373
- They opted to go with the new software.
- I know, Terry, I know.

714
00:53:05,008 --> 00:53:09,967
Hey, Cole. We got absolutely murdered in
pits four and five the last couple of nights.

715
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:12,877
Okay, Clark, I'll take a look at the tape.

716
00:53:13,082 --> 00:53:16,518
By the way, you wanna lose the cigarette?

717
00:53:17,987 --> 00:53:20,979
There's no smoking in here, you know that.

718
00:53:27,129 --> 00:53:28,653
I appreciate it.

719
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:37,305
End of an era, my friend.

720
00:53:46,549 --> 00:53:48,380
Ben. Time for school.

721
00:53:52,221 --> 00:53:54,382
I seem to keep waking up to you.

722
00:53:54,490 --> 00:53:56,151
Don't get used to it.

723
00:54:15,144 --> 00:54:17,634
I'm glad you came over this morning.

724
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:21,749
- I have something I wanna give you.
- Oh, yeah?

725
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:26,244
I want you to have this.

726
00:54:26,955 --> 00:54:28,217
What's this?

727
00:54:33,828 --> 00:54:35,659
That's a lot of money.

728
00:54:36,164 --> 00:54:39,793
I've been saving for a long time.
It's for medical school.

729
00:54:39,901 --> 00:54:44,235
I know it won't pay the whole way,
but it should help.

730
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:48,407
Ma, I can't take this.

731
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:51,037
This is your money.
You worked hard for this.

732
00:54:51,146 --> 00:54:55,947
For precisely this reason. I wanna help pay
for med school, Dr. Campbell.

733
00:55:02,123 --> 00:55:03,988
Well, you know what? You don't have to.

734
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:07,528
'Cause I got the Robinson Scholarship.

735
00:55:08,296 --> 00:55:10,821
Yep, they're gonna pay the whole way.

736
00:55:11,366 --> 00:55:15,166
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Well, because I wanted it to be a surprise.

737
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:17,465
And actually, I just found out today.

738
00:55:17,572 --> 00:55:20,735
I can't believe it! Oh, my God!

739
00:55:21,042 --> 00:55:24,307
This is amazing. I am so proud of you.

740
00:55:29,116 --> 00:55:32,313
- I knew the hard work would pay off.
- Yeah, I know.

741
00:55:32,419 --> 00:55:36,913
So, listen, you keep this, all right?
It's yours.

742
00:56:15,996 --> 00:56:17,657
What are you doing?

743
00:56:18,765 --> 00:56:22,633
I'm just jumping up and down on my bed.

744
00:56:26,473 --> 00:56:28,737
What? You never did that
when you were a kid?

745
00:56:28,842 --> 00:56:31,333
- No. Not really, never.
- No.

746
00:56:32,346 --> 00:56:33,472
Right.

747
00:56:36,750 --> 00:56:37,909
All right.

748
00:56:38,017 --> 00:56:40,451
So where were you this weekend?
I tried calling you, like, 15 times.

749
00:56:40,553 --> 00:56:44,216
Oh, yeah? I ended up
having to go to New Hampshire

750
00:56:44,323 --> 00:56:46,723
to help my cousin move.

751
00:56:46,826 --> 00:56:48,760
You didn't bring your cell phone?

752
00:56:48,861 --> 00:56:51,591
Your cell? Your phone?
You didn't bring that?

753
00:56:51,697 --> 00:56:56,999
No, I forgot it. I ended up leaving it here.
So, you know.

754
00:56:57,103 --> 00:56:59,469
Yeah, well, you missed
a hell of a dorm party on Saturday.

755
00:56:59,572 --> 00:57:00,800
Oh, yeah?

756
00:57:00,906 --> 00:57:03,136
We almost had a girl there.

757
00:57:06,012 --> 00:57:08,674
- Republik?
- Yes.

758
00:57:09,181 --> 00:57:10,205
Let's do it!

759
00:57:19,592 --> 00:57:21,116
She is an eight.

760
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:25,897
- No way. She's a 7.649.
- I was rounding up.

761
00:57:25,998 --> 00:57:28,967
Hey, I thought we agreed
we weren't gonna round up anymore.

762
00:57:29,068 --> 00:57:30,592
That's right.

763
00:57:31,470 --> 00:57:35,406
But if we win the 2.09, I'm asking her out.

764
00:57:43,649 --> 00:57:46,482
Wait. Ben? Ben, you only owe eight bucks.

765
00:57:53,491 --> 00:57:55,891
Hey. Can I get you a beer?

766
00:57:57,796 --> 00:58:00,594
- Sure.
- Yeah? Okay.

767
00:58:04,869 --> 00:58:07,360
Excuse me. Can I get two Bud Lights?

768
00:58:07,806 --> 00:58:08,898
Hey.

769
00:58:13,745 --> 00:58:15,610
- How you doing?
- I'm okay.

770
00:58:15,714 --> 00:58:17,204
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

771
00:58:18,083 --> 00:58:19,380
Thank you.

772
00:58:25,557 --> 00:58:27,923
Are those your friends over there?

773
00:58:31,496 --> 00:58:35,660
No. No, I've never seen them before
in my life.

774
00:58:37,135 --> 00:58:39,831
Could you just excuse me for one second?

775
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:45,200
Guys, I'm serious.
What are you doing? You're staring.

776
00:58:45,310 --> 00:58:46,368
Yeah, we know.

777
00:58:46,478 --> 00:58:47,502
Yeah, well, can you not?

778
00:58:47,612 --> 00:58:49,375
I think it's gonna freak her out a bit,
don't you think?

779
00:58:49,481 --> 00:58:53,110
Yeah, I got a feeling we're a little
more freaked out than she is right now.

780
00:58:53,218 --> 00:58:54,879
So how do you know her?

781
00:58:54,986 --> 00:58:58,478
Did you, like, take some self-help seminar
or something?

782
00:58:59,556 --> 00:59:00,614
What?

783
00:59:01,125 --> 00:59:04,686
- Jedi mind trick, huh?
- Jedi mind trick. Like that Luke.

784
00:59:04,962 --> 00:59:07,954
- You will drink beer.
- Right. Right, right.

785
00:59:08,065 --> 00:59:11,159
There is a fortune on the table now,
and it's all up to my dad.

786
00:59:11,268 --> 00:59:12,860
It's getting ridiculous.

787
00:59:12,970 --> 00:59:16,531
He actually needs to stop the table play,
track down my uncle and take a loan.

788
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:18,107
- No, are you serious?
- Yeah.

789
00:59:18,208 --> 00:59:20,199
They let him, and he does.

790
00:59:20,978 --> 00:59:23,845
He ends up with, like, two 19s and two 20s.

791
00:59:24,515 --> 00:59:27,006
The dealer turns over a 17.

792
00:59:27,117 --> 00:59:28,846
It's soft. He needs to take another card.

793
00:59:28,952 --> 00:59:31,318
No. Don't say a four. Is it a four?

794
00:59:31,422 --> 00:59:34,220
- It's a four, yeah.
- It's a four. My God.

795
00:59:35,559 --> 00:59:37,857
Not a great Christmas that year.

796
00:59:40,397 --> 00:59:43,855
So, what does he think about what you do?
Does he know?

797
00:59:44,435 --> 00:59:46,596
Oh, no, he's long gone, Ben.

798
00:59:49,173 --> 00:59:50,970
My dad's gone, too.

799
01:00:03,921 --> 01:00:08,221
So, you know, when you came into the store
to ask me to join the team,

800
01:00:09,059 --> 01:00:10,719
was that because...

801
01:00:11,127 --> 01:00:12,321
What?

802
01:00:12,662 --> 01:00:15,995
Well, you know,
was it because Micky asked you to?

803
01:00:19,135 --> 01:00:22,263
Look, we've had three classes together.

804
01:00:23,272 --> 01:00:26,241
You gave that presentation
on combinatorial algorithms

805
01:00:26,342 --> 01:00:28,173
that nobody understood.

806
01:00:29,312 --> 01:00:33,510
You're the smartest person in every single
one of those classes, Ben.

807
01:00:33,616 --> 01:00:37,780
That is why you're on the team.
And that's why I came into the store.

808
01:00:38,988 --> 01:00:40,922
No, no, not so much...

809
01:00:41,023 --> 01:00:43,890
- Oh, God. I'm so, so sorry.
- No. It's fine.

810
01:00:43,993 --> 01:00:46,427
- It's not a problem.
- I don't know why I just did that.

811
01:00:46,529 --> 01:00:47,757
- Don't apologize.
- Are you sure?

812
01:00:47,864 --> 01:00:50,424
Yes. Shit, this is my stop.

813
01:00:50,533 --> 01:00:52,933
- You're getting off here?
- Yeah, I've gotta get off.

814
01:00:53,035 --> 01:00:55,731
But, really, don't worry about it.

815
01:00:56,439 --> 01:00:59,602
I don't know,
it's just 'cause we've been drinking, and...

816
01:00:59,709 --> 01:01:02,200
It's just we're on a team, we work together.

817
01:01:02,311 --> 01:01:04,745
- I get it.
- Just don't feel bad about this.

818
01:01:04,847 --> 01:01:07,372
Okay. Sure. Bye.

819
01:01:27,502 --> 01:01:31,233
<i>My world was flashing by
at a million miles a minute.</i>

820
01:01:32,574 --> 01:01:35,543
<i>I had saved over $100,000.</i>

821
01:01:36,711 --> 01:01:38,770
<i>Only $200,000 to go.</i>

822
01:01:39,981 --> 01:01:43,917
<i>But there was still one thing
I couldn't get off my mind.</i>

823
01:01:54,329 --> 01:01:56,024
<i>The moment we left campus,</i>

824
01:01:56,131 --> 01:01:58,395
<i>the concept of vectors and formulas</i>

825
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:01,196
<i>were replaced with counting,
shuffle tracking</i>

826
01:02:01,303 --> 01:02:04,466
<i>knowing when to hit
and knowing when to color out.</i>

827
01:02:04,706 --> 01:02:07,300
<i>I was becoming a pro on all levels.</i>

828
01:02:07,776 --> 01:02:09,573
<i>I made more money in one trip to Vegas</i>

829
01:02:09,678 --> 01:02:15,082
<i>than I would have in 5 years, 9 months,
12 days and 6 hours at J. Press Menswear.</i>

830
01:02:17,452 --> 01:02:19,920
<i>In Boston, I was just Ben Campbell.</i>

831
01:02:20,956 --> 01:02:24,687
<i>But in Vegas, I could be anyone I wanted.</i>

832
01:02:24,793 --> 01:02:27,091
You know what I'm gonna do?
You know what I'm gonna do?

833
01:02:27,195 --> 01:02:30,460
I'm gonna throw a half-mill down
on the one hand. Come on. Hit me!

834
01:02:30,565 --> 01:02:33,795
<i>One night, I'd be the high-rolling heir
to a pharmaceutical fortune.</i>

835
01:02:33,901 --> 01:02:37,029
Leon, could you make sure
there's some champagne,

836
01:02:37,438 --> 01:02:41,101
maybe some strawberries
waiting in there for me.

837
01:02:41,609 --> 01:02:42,940
I may not be alone.

838
01:02:43,043 --> 01:02:46,672
<i>The next, I'd be the hottest video game
designer on the West Coast.</i>

839
01:02:47,281 --> 01:02:48,680
There it is.

840
01:02:48,782 --> 01:02:52,274
Winner, winner, chicken dinner!

841
01:02:56,357 --> 01:02:58,518
No, please, keep going.
This video's priceless.

842
01:03:00,027 --> 01:03:01,654
<i>I'm not gonna lie.</i>

843
01:03:02,363 --> 01:03:06,857
<i>It did get, well, a little confusing sometimes.</i>

844
01:03:07,801 --> 01:03:09,393
<i>Operator, how can I help you?</i>

845
01:03:09,503 --> 01:03:11,801
Yeah, room service.

846
01:03:11,905 --> 01:03:14,339
<i>Excuse me?
Honey, we don't do room service.</i>

847
01:03:14,441 --> 01:03:16,102
What do you mean,
you don't do room service?

848
01:03:16,210 --> 01:03:18,576
<i>I mean, we don't do room service.</i>

849
01:03:30,624 --> 01:03:33,286
<i>In Boston, we had a secret.</i>

850
01:03:39,066 --> 01:03:42,159
<i>In Vegas, we had a life.</i>

851
01:03:50,643 --> 01:03:55,080
<i>Micky said I was gonna have more fun
than I could possibly imagine.</i>

852
01:03:56,249 --> 01:03:57,807
<i>And he was right.</i>

853
01:04:01,788 --> 01:04:03,847
- Hey, Jamie. There you go.
- Nice.

854
01:04:03,956 --> 01:04:05,651
<i>It was too good to be true.</i>

855
01:04:05,758 --> 01:04:09,785
There you go. All right,
my night just got better. Thank you, Joe.

856
01:04:10,863 --> 01:04:13,730
<i>And it felt like it was never going to end.</i>

857
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:27,204
Clark? I think I got something over here.

858
01:04:27,914 --> 01:04:29,609
Take a look at this.

859
01:04:32,118 --> 01:04:34,586
That guy? He's a kid.

860
01:04:34,687 --> 01:04:38,418
He was on the tape from last week.
Got a big roll and he's crushing your table.

861
01:04:38,524 --> 01:04:40,890
Plus, he ordered a tonic and lime.

862
01:04:40,993 --> 01:04:43,689
Tonic and lime. What does that mean?

863
01:04:43,796 --> 01:04:46,026
It means he wants you
to think he's drinking.

864
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:49,431
Okay. So is he counting
or is he just getting lucky?

865
01:04:49,635 --> 01:04:51,569
He's not running a progressive system.

866
01:04:51,671 --> 01:04:54,867
He doubled on 10 when the deck was heavy,
but he didn't on 11 when it got lighter.

867
01:04:54,973 --> 01:04:57,601
- How can you tell if it's heavy or light?
- I'm counting.

868
01:04:57,709 --> 01:04:58,869
You...

869
01:05:02,214 --> 01:05:04,011
Tell me something, Cole,
if you can count that well,

870
01:05:04,116 --> 01:05:05,845
why are you still consulting for us?

871
01:05:05,951 --> 01:05:07,418
I've been asking myself the same thing.

872
01:05:07,519 --> 01:05:10,955
Let's just say I like being
on your side of the hustle.

873
01:05:11,389 --> 01:05:14,381
Bring up a frame of that for me
on the printer.

874
01:05:17,896 --> 01:05:20,387
So, Terry, I heard
you guys are losing a lot of work

875
01:05:20,499 --> 01:05:23,525
to that biometric facial recognition software.

876
01:05:25,103 --> 01:05:28,698
Just gives us a little bit more time
to focus on you guys.

877
01:05:31,243 --> 01:05:33,973
- That's impressive software.
- They do.

878
01:05:34,646 --> 01:05:35,977
Here he is.

879
01:05:38,316 --> 01:05:41,376
I still think there're bigger fish
to fry out there.

880
01:05:41,486 --> 01:05:42,817
So do I.

881
01:05:50,695 --> 01:05:52,287
Hey, Fisher.

882
01:05:52,397 --> 01:05:54,456
He's mad at me and jealous of you.

883
01:05:54,566 --> 01:05:57,057
But don't worry.
Greatness evokes that reaction sometimes.

884
01:05:57,169 --> 01:06:00,104
- Don't worry about it. I gotta go.
- All right.

885
01:06:08,979 --> 01:06:10,947
- Hey.
- What's going on?

886
01:06:12,183 --> 01:06:15,812
He just didn't like the subject
I chose for my final paper.

887
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:17,547
- That's bullshit, Ben.
- What?

888
01:06:17,655 --> 01:06:19,589
I know when you're lying,
I'm your best friend.

889
01:06:19,690 --> 01:06:21,715
At least I thought I was.

890
01:06:22,860 --> 01:06:24,452
Are you on drugs, Ben?

891
01:06:24,562 --> 01:06:26,496
Because there's a group that meets
at Simpson Hall on Saturdays.

892
01:06:26,597 --> 01:06:28,531
No, no. Cam, I'm not on drugs, okay?

893
01:06:28,632 --> 01:06:31,396
I'll go to the meeting if you need me to.

894
01:06:32,002 --> 01:06:34,732
Why didn't you tell me you quit J. Press?

895
01:06:36,207 --> 01:06:37,640
I don't know.

896
01:06:38,108 --> 01:06:40,338
- Is it Jill Taylor?
- No.

897
01:06:42,513 --> 01:06:44,174
What about Harvard?

898
01:06:45,649 --> 01:06:48,311
It'll find a way of working itself out.

899
01:06:49,019 --> 01:06:51,613
Look, I gotta go. I'll see you.

900
01:07:03,901 --> 01:07:07,997
<i>I think the worst part of it
was not being able to tell anyone.</i>

901
01:07:12,176 --> 01:07:16,305
<i>But for the first time in my life,
the world made itself easy for me.</i>

902
01:07:17,947 --> 01:07:19,073
Here you go, sir.

903
01:07:19,182 --> 01:07:20,740
<i>And I liked it.</i>

904
01:07:21,451 --> 01:07:22,918
That's for you.

905
01:07:25,188 --> 01:07:29,522
We just made $210,000.

906
01:07:29,626 --> 01:07:30,684
Yes.

907
01:07:30,793 --> 01:07:33,284
Now, Ben, this is how we play!

908
01:07:35,932 --> 01:07:38,366
<i>And play we did.</i>

909
01:07:42,605 --> 01:07:44,698
<i>Nothing cost too much.</i>

910
01:07:44,807 --> 01:07:47,332
<i>Nothing was out of reach.</i>

911
01:07:52,982 --> 01:07:55,815
<i>I guess you could say
the casino host of fate</i>

912
01:07:55,919 --> 01:07:58,513
<i>gave Ben Campbell a major upgrade.</i>

913
01:08:01,491 --> 01:08:04,358
<i>Dorm rooms turned into high-roller suites.</i>

914
01:08:06,029 --> 01:08:08,554
<i>Bicycles became stretch limos.</i>

915
01:08:12,201 --> 01:08:13,634
No, no!

916
01:08:16,940 --> 01:08:21,400
<i>And college bars that were always filled
with frat dudes were upgraded to,</i>

917
01:08:22,245 --> 01:08:26,146
<i>well, something more interesting.</i>

918
01:09:20,002 --> 01:09:23,768
- Hey, baby. Where you in from?
- I'm from Boston.

919
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:28,942
- On a convention?
- No, business, actually.

920
01:09:31,146 --> 01:09:33,512
What line of work you in, mister?

921
01:09:34,249 --> 01:09:36,011
I count things.

922
01:09:38,185 --> 01:09:39,777
My name's Sierra.

923
01:09:40,354 --> 01:09:45,587
Hi, Sierra. I'm Salvador Sanchez.

924
01:09:47,595 --> 01:09:50,359
Would you like a private dance, Salvador?

925
01:09:51,966 --> 01:09:55,868
Well, that all depends
on how much it's gonna run me, Sierra.

926
01:09:58,372 --> 01:10:01,000
$20 a song, 30-song minimum.

927
01:10:02,877 --> 01:10:04,469
Sounds expensive.

928
01:10:23,531 --> 01:10:27,991
- Good evening, Mr. Klein.
- Hey, Frank. It's good to see you.

929
01:10:28,102 --> 01:10:30,593
Jeffrey, you're taking my money.

930
01:10:31,705 --> 01:10:33,673
You are so lucky you're cute.

931
01:10:33,774 --> 01:10:36,470
'Cause if you weren't cute, I'd leave.
You know that?

932
01:10:36,577 --> 01:10:40,138
Jeffrey. My brother from another mother.

933
01:10:40,714 --> 01:10:41,806
How you doing? You good?

934
01:10:41,916 --> 01:10:45,113
I'm good, I'm good, Mr. K.
What, are you back in town for business?

935
01:10:45,219 --> 01:10:50,349
- It's all business in this town, right?
- Well, with your money, I'm sure it always is.

936
01:10:51,257 --> 01:10:53,191
Oh, damn, I forgot my ring.

937
01:10:53,293 --> 01:10:55,193
Oh, please.

938
01:11:01,968 --> 01:11:05,233
I don't wanna bet that. That's for keep.

939
01:11:05,572 --> 01:11:07,267
$100,000 going out.

940
01:11:09,642 --> 01:11:11,303
Thank you, Jeffrey.

941
01:11:18,518 --> 01:11:20,577
Cole. Your boy's back.

942
01:11:24,591 --> 01:11:26,149
- That's him, right?
- There he is.

943
01:11:26,259 --> 01:11:29,285
And he brought
a whole lot more money with him.

944
01:11:36,436 --> 01:11:38,996
That is a hell of a suit, by the way.

945
01:11:54,587 --> 01:11:58,818
- That is some aftershave he has going on.
- Sir, could you not? Please.

946
01:12:03,829 --> 01:12:07,196
This girl's only betting the table minimum.
Why's she keep looking at him?

947
01:12:07,299 --> 01:12:11,998
Terry, rewind the tape. I wanna see
if she signals him to come to the table.

948
01:12:13,405 --> 01:12:17,000
We don't use "tape" anymore, old school.
It's digital now.

949
01:12:19,411 --> 01:12:21,572
Never mind. Terry, rewind it.

950
01:12:24,449 --> 01:12:25,973
Okay, okay.

951
01:12:26,718 --> 01:12:28,379
She's playing the table minimum.

952
01:12:28,487 --> 01:12:30,648
Now, in a second,
she's gonna do something.

953
01:12:30,756 --> 01:12:34,624
She's gonna raise her hand,
scratch her head... There it is.

954
01:12:35,794 --> 01:12:38,729
That's the signal. See?
She gave him the signal.

955
01:12:38,830 --> 01:12:42,163
He comes to the table.
I'm telling you, they're working together.

956
01:12:42,267 --> 01:12:43,325
Nice.

957
01:12:45,003 --> 01:12:47,563
Show me a computer that can do that.

958
01:12:52,411 --> 01:12:54,038
You look familiar.

959
01:12:55,347 --> 01:12:57,110
I know you, don't I?

960
01:12:58,717 --> 01:13:00,548
- I don't think so.
- No?

961
01:13:01,086 --> 01:13:05,352
<i>Oh, sure, you look exactly like that guy
in Rain Man.</i>

962
01:13:07,692 --> 01:13:10,525
Oh, yeah? Well, people say
I look like Tom Cruise all the time.

963
01:13:10,628 --> 01:13:12,323
Oh, yeah? No.

964
01:13:13,431 --> 01:13:17,094
The other one, the... What's his... The retard.

965
01:13:18,102 --> 01:13:23,335
I just love that scene in Vegas
when the retard wins at blackjack.

966
01:13:24,275 --> 01:13:26,209
You look just like that.

967
01:13:30,081 --> 01:13:36,953
What I could never understand, though,
is how someone so retarded,

968
01:13:37,855 --> 01:13:39,550
could win so much.

969
01:13:41,926 --> 01:13:45,418
Hey, Jeffrey,
his brother from another mother,

970
01:13:45,529 --> 01:13:47,292
how did that retard win so much?

971
01:13:47,398 --> 01:13:50,333
- You know what, sir? I think that maybe...
- Okay, get your hands off me.

972
01:13:50,434 --> 01:13:52,629
Oh, I didn't mean it.

973
01:14:26,836 --> 01:14:30,033
His luck'll run out eventually.
It always does.

974
01:14:40,417 --> 01:14:42,647
- Hey, Ben...
- No, Ben, stop it!

975
01:14:42,752 --> 01:14:44,617
- What the hell is the matter with you?
- Hey, come on! Ben!

976
01:14:44,721 --> 01:14:48,179
Oh, you think that's funny?
You think that was funny? Shut up!

977
01:14:48,291 --> 01:14:49,656
I understand, Ben. We don't need anymore...

978
01:14:49,759 --> 01:14:51,590
This is not the time. Okay?

979
01:14:51,695 --> 01:14:54,493
I want to thank you
for confirming my choice in Ben.

980
01:14:54,597 --> 01:14:55,962
Now go home.

981
01:15:02,339 --> 01:15:04,330
- What?
- You're off the team.

982
01:15:04,441 --> 01:15:05,499
No.

983
01:15:06,509 --> 01:15:09,876
- I was drunk, I was...
- I don't care what you were.

984
01:15:11,114 --> 01:15:12,411
I'm not leaving.

985
01:15:12,515 --> 01:15:15,040
Yes, you are.

986
01:15:15,552 --> 01:15:18,020
What are you gonna do about it, huh?

987
01:15:21,891 --> 01:15:25,759
You've been the big man for a long time,
but you just acted like a child.

988
01:15:25,862 --> 01:15:28,989
So I want you to pick up the ticket
and go home,

989
01:15:29,098 --> 01:15:33,125
because if you don't,
you know exactly what I'm capable of doing,

990
01:15:33,736 --> 01:15:35,033
don't you?

991
01:15:52,287 --> 01:15:53,276
All right, listen up.

992
01:15:53,389 --> 01:15:56,916
Casino's gonna change out their chips,
just like the MGM did after the Tyson fight.

993
01:15:57,025 --> 01:15:59,892
That means we got less than 24 hours
to cash in,

994
01:15:59,995 --> 01:16:02,259
or we're gonna be sitting
with 200 grand of worthless plastic.

995
01:16:02,364 --> 01:16:04,594
- So we'll cash out.
- It's too hot.

996
01:16:04,700 --> 01:16:08,602
They're gonna be dissecting the eye in
the sky footage of Fisher's little power play.

997
01:16:08,704 --> 01:16:10,899
So let's do it right now
before they can do that.

998
01:16:11,006 --> 01:16:12,974
Are you deliberately slow?

999
01:16:13,809 --> 01:16:15,367
What about them?

1000
01:16:16,745 --> 01:16:18,303
What about them?

1001
01:16:18,414 --> 01:16:22,714
They can cash in the chips.
The casino's just gonna think they're tips.

1002
01:16:30,159 --> 01:16:31,592
- Cashing out.
- Thank you.

1003
01:16:31,693 --> 01:16:33,786
- Thank you.
- Thanks, sweetie.

1004
01:16:34,396 --> 01:16:36,830
- Thanks, hon.
- Thank you, baby.

1005
01:16:41,502 --> 01:16:43,561
I love a parade, don't you?

1006
01:16:44,739 --> 01:16:48,505
You know, there's a word
I don't throw around all that often,

1007
01:16:49,110 --> 01:16:50,338
"Genius."

1008
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:21,866
Hey, Kianna.
Let me hold your bag for a second.

1009
01:17:22,577 --> 01:17:23,839
Thanks, baby, here.

1010
01:17:23,945 --> 01:17:25,435
Oh, no problem. Anytime.

1011
01:17:25,546 --> 01:17:28,447
- Watch. Watch, watch. Ready?
- Okay, I'm watching. That's beautiful.

1012
01:17:28,549 --> 01:17:29,538
Watch.

1013
01:17:29,650 --> 01:17:33,381
No, it's great, you just need
to get your knee a little higher.

1014
01:17:55,542 --> 01:17:57,066
- Hi.
- Hey.

1015
01:17:58,445 --> 01:18:00,879
So the Hard Rock comped me a suite.

1016
01:18:02,115 --> 01:18:04,083
That's cool, that's great.

1017
01:18:07,153 --> 01:18:08,848
You wanna see it?

1018
01:19:11,216 --> 01:19:13,878
All right, take care, Bobby. All right?

1019
01:19:34,373 --> 01:19:35,897
God, it's cold.

1020
01:19:36,342 --> 01:19:38,242
Hey, what time is it?

1021
01:19:39,211 --> 01:19:42,374
He's only 45 minutes late.
Show a little patience.

1022
01:19:43,782 --> 01:19:45,841
Oh, look. Here he comes.

1023
01:19:46,652 --> 01:19:48,643
Guys, I'm sorry I'm late.

1024
01:19:48,754 --> 01:19:49,982
Hey, Ben.

1025
01:19:50,255 --> 01:19:52,052
You know, you could try
returning a call once in a while.

1026
01:19:52,157 --> 01:19:54,318
Good of you to show up, man.
It's not like we're cold or anything.

1027
01:19:54,426 --> 01:19:55,791
Yeah, funny.

1028
01:19:57,096 --> 01:20:00,725
- Hey, did you bring it?
- Yeah, I got it. There it is.

1029
01:20:00,833 --> 01:20:03,768
And you're sure
you didn't inlay the software on more space

1030
01:20:03,869 --> 01:20:05,063
than the parameters suggest?

1031
01:20:05,170 --> 01:20:07,195
No. It's just one-fifth of the free face.

1032
01:20:07,306 --> 01:20:09,297
Let's fire this mother up.

1033
01:20:09,408 --> 01:20:10,670
Beautiful.

1034
01:20:19,517 --> 01:20:20,745
Okay.

1035
01:20:21,285 --> 01:20:22,377
Okay.

1036
01:20:25,890 --> 01:20:27,482
What's happening?

1037
01:20:30,828 --> 01:20:33,353
- I don't understand.
- It's the wrong size.

1038
01:20:33,464 --> 01:20:34,726
No. What?

1039
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:39,099
- What the hell, Ben? This is an 8K.
- Right.

1040
01:20:40,772 --> 01:20:42,672
Yeah, we needed 16K!

1041
01:20:44,108 --> 01:20:47,908
- I can't believe this.
- I thought it was an 8K.

1042
01:20:48,012 --> 01:20:49,604
- No, you didn't.
- Yeah, I did.

1043
01:20:49,714 --> 01:20:53,946
No, you didn't. You knew the entire time
the discrete was 16K.

1044
01:20:54,452 --> 01:20:55,714
Damn it, Ben.

1045
01:20:55,820 --> 01:20:59,085
It's gonna take us two weeks
to get a fresh 16K from the fabrication.

1046
01:20:59,190 --> 01:21:02,591
And another five days, minimum,
to get it ready to press.

1047
01:21:02,694 --> 01:21:06,130
Miles, calm down, all right?
It was an honest mistake.

1048
01:21:08,766 --> 01:21:10,063
What?

1049
01:21:12,403 --> 01:21:17,170
You know what? I think we're gonna have
to go at this without you, man.

1050
01:21:18,276 --> 01:21:19,971
You're gonna what?

1051
01:21:22,813 --> 01:21:26,408
No, no.
This is just as much mine as it is yours.

1052
01:21:26,516 --> 01:21:29,110
We've been working on this for over a year.

1053
01:21:29,219 --> 01:21:32,780
I know that.
But your heart just isn't in this anymore.

1054
01:21:38,562 --> 01:21:40,120
Are you serious?

1055
01:21:46,837 --> 01:21:47,861
Fine.

1056
01:21:49,706 --> 01:21:50,798
Fine.

1057
01:21:52,209 --> 01:21:56,441
You know what? I don't even care.
Honestly, I don't even care.

1058
01:21:56,546 --> 01:21:57,774
You know why?

1059
01:21:57,881 --> 01:22:02,250
'Cause no one in the real world gives a shit
about the 2.09 Competition.

1060
01:22:03,353 --> 01:22:05,218
You know, it's just something
that you build up in your head

1061
01:22:05,322 --> 01:22:07,313
to make yourselves feel important.

1062
01:22:07,424 --> 01:22:09,324
You guys are pathetic.

1063
01:22:09,426 --> 01:22:10,586
Thanks.

1064
01:22:17,567 --> 01:22:18,966
Welcome back, Mr. Youngman.

1065
01:22:19,069 --> 01:22:22,835
- Thanks, Joseph. It's good to see you.
- Good to see you, too.

1066
01:22:26,476 --> 01:22:29,468
Good evening, Mr. Youngman,
welcome back to the Red Rock.

1067
01:22:29,579 --> 01:22:31,046
Nice to see you.

1068
01:22:31,148 --> 01:22:33,809
Anything I can do for you, let me know.

1069
01:22:51,367 --> 01:22:52,732
Double down.

1070
01:23:28,470 --> 01:23:31,496
I guess you play big or you don't play at all.

1071
01:23:32,708 --> 01:23:33,936
Right?

1072
01:23:36,445 --> 01:23:40,472
Honey, there you are. Let's go.
We don't wanna miss the show!

1073
01:23:40,583 --> 01:23:43,380
Honey, we're actually playing a game here.

1074
01:23:43,852 --> 01:23:44,944
Yeah.

1075
01:23:45,353 --> 01:23:47,116
Yeah, so you know what?

1076
01:23:47,222 --> 01:23:51,283
Why don't you run upstairs
and wait for me there? Okay?

1077
01:23:53,895 --> 01:23:55,726
All right. Let's go.

1078
01:24:00,902 --> 01:24:02,893
Yeah, all right.

1079
01:24:03,504 --> 01:24:06,098
I've got the worst headache right now.

1080
01:24:20,121 --> 01:24:21,952
- Ten.
- Come on, monkey.

1081
01:24:22,056 --> 01:24:24,422
- Fourteen.
- Come on. Come on, monkey.

1082
01:24:24,525 --> 01:24:26,652
- Sixteen.
- Monkey. Come on.

1083
01:24:27,962 --> 01:24:29,395
Twenty-one.

1084
01:24:35,837 --> 01:24:37,771
Pete, you're killing us.

1085
01:24:51,019 --> 01:24:53,010
I guess it's not my night.

1086
01:25:17,945 --> 01:25:20,072
Are you out of your mind?

1087
01:25:21,448 --> 01:25:23,473
I don't know what happened.

1088
01:25:23,750 --> 01:25:26,378
I messed up. I'm sorry.

1089
01:25:27,554 --> 01:25:28,782
Oh, you're sorry.

1090
01:25:28,889 --> 01:25:32,484
Well, see, now that's what I've been waiting
to hear, Ben. As long as you're sorry.

1091
01:25:32,592 --> 01:25:37,154
I'm out 200 grand, but Ben's sorry!
Everybody hear that? Ben's sorry!

1092
01:25:37,264 --> 01:25:41,325
So we can all go back to being friends
and laughing over cocktails!

1093
01:25:42,536 --> 01:25:43,901
Come on, Micky. It can happen to anyone.

1094
01:25:44,004 --> 01:25:45,437
They get on a rush and they lose control.

1095
01:25:45,539 --> 01:25:47,166
You shut your mouth. This is business.

1096
01:25:47,274 --> 01:25:50,641
Hey, I let you down, all right? I get it.

1097
01:25:50,744 --> 01:25:54,578
Excuse me? You let me down? I don't care!

1098
01:25:55,215 --> 01:25:58,343
Let me make one thing clear to you,
I am not your father!

1099
01:25:58,452 --> 01:26:01,478
You are not my friend. This is a business.

1100
01:26:01,755 --> 01:26:03,882
You are only as good to me
as the money you make,

1101
01:26:03,991 --> 01:26:05,685
and, right now, it's not worth a hell of a lot!

1102
01:26:05,791 --> 01:26:07,520
You're gonna give me back
everything you lost.

1103
01:26:07,626 --> 01:26:10,390
I can't do that! That money was for Harvard!

1104
01:26:10,496 --> 01:26:12,396
I have made you so much more
than what I just lost!

1105
01:26:12,498 --> 01:26:14,329
It doesn't matter, Ben.

1106
01:26:14,433 --> 01:26:17,561
You had very clear instructions,
and you didn't follow them.

1107
01:26:17,670 --> 01:26:21,606
You didn't do your job.
You weren't counting, you were gambling!

1108
01:26:24,143 --> 01:26:27,044
Well, why aren't you out there, then, Micky?

1109
01:26:27,613 --> 01:26:32,312
I mean, we take all the risks.
Seems to me like you don't do shit.

1110
01:26:37,023 --> 01:26:38,957
This isn't about me,

1111
01:26:39,792 --> 01:26:43,489
you arrogant little infant.

1112
01:26:56,409 --> 01:26:59,037
You can all find your own way
back to Boston.

1113
01:26:59,145 --> 01:27:03,206
And, Ben, you're gonna pay me that money,
every penny, one way or the other.

1114
01:27:03,315 --> 01:27:05,306
And you damn well know it.

1115
01:27:15,393 --> 01:27:16,883
I need a drink.

1116
01:27:19,731 --> 01:27:21,164
Anybody else?

1117
01:27:24,202 --> 01:27:25,931
Yeah, well, we don't need him.

1118
01:27:26,037 --> 01:27:27,698
- Yeah, okay, Ben.
- No, I'm serious.

1119
01:27:27,806 --> 01:27:30,468
Why do we need him?
We have our own money now.

1120
01:27:30,575 --> 01:27:33,840
You know, his cut was 50%,
and he doesn't even play!

1121
01:27:34,412 --> 01:27:35,572
Why do we need him?

1122
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:36,772
Hey, you know what I think?

1123
01:27:36,881 --> 01:27:40,214
I think we play out the weekend,
and I think we do this without him.

1124
01:27:40,318 --> 01:27:41,717
No. No, I don't think that's a good idea.

1125
01:27:41,820 --> 01:27:44,050
I think we should go back to Boston
and figure this out.

1126
01:27:44,155 --> 01:27:45,952
Yeah, well,
why don't we let the team decide?

1127
01:27:46,057 --> 01:27:49,185
I'm with Jill. This is Micky's thing.
Micky brought us together.

1128
01:27:49,294 --> 01:27:51,285
And then he drove us apart.

1129
01:27:51,396 --> 01:27:54,422
I mean, you saw
how he played Fisher against me.

1130
01:27:55,366 --> 01:27:58,995
Choi, what do you say, man?
You wanna make some money?

1131
01:28:00,505 --> 01:28:02,166
- Kind of.
- Really?

1132
01:28:02,941 --> 01:28:06,206
We need 100 grand just to play.
You're talking about risking our own money.

1133
01:28:06,311 --> 01:28:09,474
All I'm saying is that we try it. You know?

1134
01:28:09,581 --> 01:28:13,381
If we make the investment,
then we take all of the winnings.

1135
01:28:14,452 --> 01:28:15,749
All of it.

1136
01:28:22,894 --> 01:28:24,191
Okay.

1137
01:28:28,499 --> 01:28:29,557
Yeah.

1138
01:28:30,033 --> 01:28:32,092
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1139
01:28:33,837 --> 01:28:35,031
Choi?

1140
01:28:36,406 --> 01:28:37,668
I'm in.

1141
01:28:39,543 --> 01:28:41,238
Now I need a drink.

1142
01:28:47,217 --> 01:28:48,980
- What are you doing?
- What?

1143
01:28:49,086 --> 01:28:51,054
What are you doing?

1144
01:28:51,155 --> 01:28:53,214
Well, we're printing money.

1145
01:28:53,657 --> 01:28:56,353
What, you think just 'cause Micky left
that we're gonna stop?

1146
01:28:56,460 --> 01:28:59,258
No, I could do this. I can lead this team.

1147
01:28:59,630 --> 01:29:02,895
You know, I'm not the same guy
I was back in Boston.

1148
01:29:03,367 --> 01:29:05,597
- Exactly.
- Yeah, exactly.

1149
01:29:06,103 --> 01:29:08,731
You know, isn't this exactly
who you wanted me to be

1150
01:29:08,839 --> 01:29:11,831
when you first came into the store
to buy a tie?

1151
01:29:16,113 --> 01:29:18,775
What happened to "$300,000 and I'm out"?

1152
01:29:19,716 --> 01:29:22,412
What happened to "a means to an end"?

1153
01:29:23,353 --> 01:29:26,186
- How much do you have?
- What?

1154
01:29:26,290 --> 01:29:28,485
- How much do you have?
- I got enough.

1155
01:29:28,592 --> 01:29:30,822
Come on, Ben. How much do you have
saved back in Boston?

1156
01:29:30,928 --> 01:29:33,453
I've got 315 grand, all right?

1157
01:29:33,830 --> 01:29:36,128
Then why are you still here?

1158
01:29:37,466 --> 01:29:41,425
Because I wanna still be here.
I like being here.

1159
01:29:41,871 --> 01:29:43,736
So does everybody else.

1160
01:29:44,140 --> 01:29:46,836
So come on, Jill. Are you in?

1161
01:29:52,715 --> 01:29:55,479
You are the big player, Ben.

1162
01:29:55,585 --> 01:29:56,950
Yes, I am.

1163
01:29:59,388 --> 01:30:01,288
Yeah, can I get a drink?

1164
01:30:29,218 --> 01:30:31,152
Rose, I wanna thank you.

1165
01:30:32,188 --> 01:30:34,554
You have been most accommodating.

1166
01:30:35,124 --> 01:30:37,092
All right, that's for you.

1167
01:30:37,393 --> 01:30:39,691
Okay, take care. Hey, good luck.

1168
01:30:47,270 --> 01:30:49,260
Hey, how we doing here, people?

1169
01:31:00,582 --> 01:31:03,983
Yeah, I'm gonna put you on hold
while I track him down.

1170
01:31:07,589 --> 01:31:09,716
Just got an interesting call.

1171
01:31:11,826 --> 01:31:15,887
There's nobody left to fire us.
Planet Hollywood is our last client.

1172
01:31:18,333 --> 01:31:20,233
I don't know about that.

1173
01:31:25,874 --> 01:31:27,307
This is Cole.

1174
01:31:38,086 --> 01:31:40,884
Queen of diamonds. Your lady luck tonight.

1175
01:31:41,389 --> 01:31:43,016
You're doing good.

1176
01:31:43,325 --> 01:31:45,088
You're a real winner.

1177
01:31:49,864 --> 01:31:52,560
Sometimes. Just like everybody else.

1178
01:31:53,635 --> 01:31:55,830
Now, why don't I believe that?

1179
01:31:57,939 --> 01:31:59,997
Maybe you're just smarter
than everybody else, huh?

1180
01:32:00,107 --> 01:32:02,769
Yeah, I bet it's been that way your entire life.

1181
01:32:02,876 --> 01:32:06,642
Except it just recently started
paying dividends, am I right?

1182
01:32:08,382 --> 01:32:09,747
I'd split them.

1183
01:32:09,850 --> 01:32:14,287
Deck's heavy as hell and since
I've been here, the true count's at plus 7.

1184
01:32:21,095 --> 01:32:23,188
Kianna. I think
we have a serious problem over there.

1185
01:32:23,297 --> 01:32:24,764
- Walk now!
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit!

1186
01:32:24,865 --> 01:32:27,925
Let's go. I'm out. Thank you.
Let's go, Jill. Let's go.

1187
01:32:28,035 --> 01:32:29,764
I think we need
to call security or something.

1188
01:32:29,870 --> 01:32:33,465
Yeah, I don't think they're gonna help.
Let's go! Come on.

1189
01:32:38,078 --> 01:32:40,046
Let's take a walk, huh?

1190
01:32:40,781 --> 01:32:44,547
Come on, kid.
See if we can't get you that chicken dinner.

1191
01:32:49,723 --> 01:32:52,317
It's called Biometrics.

1192
01:32:52,426 --> 01:32:56,658
Biometrics.
It's sort of like a fingerprint of your face.

1193
01:32:59,299 --> 01:33:04,532
See, when the player sits down
at the table, the software, it reads this...

1194
01:33:04,638 --> 01:33:06,105
Biometric profile.

1195
01:33:06,206 --> 01:33:07,969
...biometric profile of your face,

1196
01:33:08,075 --> 01:33:11,100
cross-references it
with a database of counters.

1197
01:33:14,647 --> 01:33:19,448
Software'll probably put you and me
out of business, but it still can't do this.

1198
01:33:22,622 --> 01:33:23,919
All right.

1199
01:33:29,495 --> 01:33:32,362
You understand all this. You go to MIT.

1200
01:33:32,732 --> 01:33:34,131
Smart boy.

1201
01:33:35,601 --> 01:33:37,535
My name is Cole Williams.

1202
01:33:38,137 --> 01:33:41,402
And if I ever see you in this town again,

1203
01:33:42,175 --> 01:33:45,576
I will break your cheek bone
with a small hammer,

1204
01:33:46,813 --> 01:33:48,804
and then I will kill you.

1205
01:33:53,486 --> 01:33:57,047
Please. Please just take the money.

1206
01:33:58,291 --> 01:33:59,815
You can take it.

1207
01:34:02,528 --> 01:34:03,859
Tell me,

1208
01:34:04,430 --> 01:34:09,163
how's good old Professor Rosa doing, huh?

1209
01:34:10,837 --> 01:34:15,433
Oh, yeah. Me and Micky, we go way back.

1210
01:34:16,542 --> 01:34:19,533
I spent years, chased him all over this town.

1211
01:34:19,978 --> 01:34:24,938
Giving him beat downs left and right,
only to find him at the tables a week later.

1212
01:34:25,050 --> 01:34:27,018
He was very persistent.

1213
01:34:27,919 --> 01:34:31,218
And then, one September night,

1214
01:34:31,723 --> 01:34:34,624
when I was in Barstow
at my father's funeral,

1215
01:34:35,494 --> 01:34:38,930
my casino was taken for seven figures.

1216
01:34:39,030 --> 01:34:40,361
Can you imagine that?

1217
01:34:40,465 --> 01:34:43,696
The most ever taken by a single counter
in one night.

1218
01:34:43,802 --> 01:34:48,398
'Course I was, naturally,
unceremoniously fired.

1219
01:34:51,109 --> 01:34:52,872
Funny thing, though.

1220
01:34:53,278 --> 01:34:55,803
I never saw Micky Rosa after that.

1221
01:34:56,982 --> 01:34:58,108
Never.

1222
01:36:24,835 --> 01:36:26,962
<i>Cauchy was the first
to make a rigorous study</i>

1223
01:36:27,071 --> 01:36:31,098
of the conditions for convergence
of an infinite series.

1224
01:36:31,208 --> 01:36:33,506
And was concerned with developing

1225
01:36:33,611 --> 01:36:38,480
the basic theorems of the calculus
as rigorously as possible.

1226
01:36:39,883 --> 01:36:41,315
Any questions?

1227
01:36:41,718 --> 01:36:43,845
No? All right, moving on.

1228
01:36:44,887 --> 01:36:48,880
Isn't it true Cauchy stole from his students?

1229
01:36:53,796 --> 01:36:57,664
Yes, I heard that.
What's your theory on that?

1230
01:36:58,701 --> 01:37:03,229
They say he used his students
for their brilliance,

1231
01:37:04,374 --> 01:37:08,606
then discredited them
and stole their equations,

1232
01:37:10,680 --> 01:37:12,545
stole their hard work.

1233
01:37:15,251 --> 01:37:17,947
Well, that wouldn't be the first time
a teacher was accused of that.

1234
01:37:18,054 --> 01:37:22,753
I think what he's referring to
is Vladimir Stupnitsky, yes?

1235
01:37:22,859 --> 01:37:25,794
He was a student of Cauchy's
who accused Cauchy

1236
01:37:25,895 --> 01:37:29,228
of stealing his four-volume text
on this analysis

1237
01:37:29,332 --> 01:37:31,800
and publishing it under a pseudonym.

1238
01:37:33,636 --> 01:37:35,297
Of course, nobody knows
what really went down there.

1239
01:37:35,405 --> 01:37:39,398
They never did prove it, and without
the proof, it's a little like it never happened.

1240
01:37:39,509 --> 01:37:41,534
And, you know, it's a real shame,

1241
01:37:41,644 --> 01:37:45,842
because if Stupnitsky had just realized
that he shouldn't have crossed Cauchy,

1242
01:37:45,948 --> 01:37:47,677
this was the dispute,

1243
01:37:48,718 --> 01:37:54,713
if he'd been able to get beyond some
of the personal mistakes that were made,

1244
01:37:55,257 --> 01:37:58,488
I have no doubt that Cauchy
would have worked with him again,

1245
01:37:58,593 --> 01:38:01,619
and they could have
done great things together.

1246
01:38:02,030 --> 01:38:06,091
But, as history shows us,
some students never learn.

1247
01:38:07,803 --> 01:38:09,464
You should get that eye looked at.

1248
01:38:46,675 --> 01:38:48,074
You okay?

1249
01:38:51,046 --> 01:38:52,673
Everything's gone.

1250
01:38:54,483 --> 01:38:57,077
- What?
- Micky's taken everything.

1251
01:38:57,185 --> 01:39:01,417
He's taken the money,
taken away Harvard Med, even MIT.

1252
01:39:03,290 --> 01:39:05,383
- What are you talking about?
- Micky, he's taken everything.

1253
01:39:05,493 --> 01:39:07,893
I gotta find a way to get it back.

1254
01:39:09,196 --> 01:39:10,686
Are you insane?

1255
01:39:11,298 --> 01:39:14,859
You just got the shit kicked out of you
and you won't let this go!

1256
01:39:14,969 --> 01:39:18,905
Look, what am I supposed to do, Jill?
I've just lost everything!

1257
01:39:19,673 --> 01:39:21,163
Look, please...

1258
01:39:22,977 --> 01:39:25,241
I don't want to lose you, too.

1259
01:39:28,249 --> 01:39:31,844
Ben, you were dragged away in Vegas.

1260
01:39:32,520 --> 01:39:36,854
I haven't heard from you.
I had no idea where you were.

1261
01:39:37,558 --> 01:39:38,786
I know.

1262
01:39:39,760 --> 01:39:40,920
I know.

1263
01:39:48,269 --> 01:39:51,067
You know, I'm so sorry that I hurt you.

1264
01:39:52,873 --> 01:39:54,238
I'm sorry.

1265
01:39:57,111 --> 01:40:01,605
In Vegas, I don't know what happened.
That wasn't me.

1266
01:40:02,817 --> 01:40:04,444
Look, you know me.

1267
01:40:05,152 --> 01:40:07,017
You know what I'm like.

1268
01:40:08,823 --> 01:40:10,313
You know me.

1269
01:40:16,763 --> 01:40:18,628
I need you to trust me.

1270
01:40:19,966 --> 01:40:23,333
<i>And the winner of this year's 2.09</i>

1271
01:40:23,436 --> 01:40:29,705
<i>for excellence in the field of robotics
goes to the team of Conolly and Kazazi!</i>

1272
01:41:07,080 --> 01:41:10,049
That's it. That's the story.

1273
01:41:12,552 --> 01:41:14,782
Jill Taylor. Really?

1274
01:41:15,588 --> 01:41:19,080
- Yeah. Yeah, really.
- Wow.

1275
01:41:19,192 --> 01:41:23,390
Yeah, it doesn't feel like "wow," Miles.
I really screwed up.

1276
01:41:23,495 --> 01:41:28,228
Yeah, you did.
But you had a life experience.

1277
01:41:32,671 --> 01:41:34,662
I can't believe how I treated you, Miles.

1278
01:41:34,773 --> 01:41:38,675
You know, you're my best friend,
and I really let you down.

1279
01:41:39,544 --> 01:41:42,638
I really let you down. I'm sorry.

1280
01:41:44,449 --> 01:41:48,977
And I'm happy for you, you know?
Winning the 2.09? That's great.

1281
01:41:50,355 --> 01:41:52,823
- Jill Taylor. Really?
- Yeah.

1282
01:41:55,360 --> 01:41:57,453
So let me get this straight.

1283
01:41:58,130 --> 01:42:01,293
Money, girls,

1284
01:42:02,467 --> 01:42:06,870
high-roller suites, clubs, Vegas.

1285
01:42:08,073 --> 01:42:13,101
Yeah, I think I probably would have
blown off the 2.09 Competition, too.

1286
01:42:16,648 --> 01:42:18,013
So we cool?

1287
01:42:19,651 --> 01:42:21,243
Yeah, we're cool.

1288
01:42:21,753 --> 01:42:24,449
But you better believe that
you're gonna make this up to me, big time.

1289
01:42:24,556 --> 01:42:25,818
All right.

1290
01:42:27,125 --> 01:42:29,252
So, what are you gonna do now?

1291
01:43:20,044 --> 01:43:21,875
What do you want, Ben?
This is an alumni dinner.

1292
01:43:21,979 --> 01:43:24,345
You need a diploma
to come to one of these.

1293
01:43:24,448 --> 01:43:26,848
Wait. Stupnitsky wants back in.

1294
01:43:33,057 --> 01:43:34,024
What?

1295
01:43:34,125 --> 01:43:38,255
Look, I've had some time
to think about what you said.

1296
01:43:40,131 --> 01:43:41,621
I want back in.

1297
01:43:42,600 --> 01:43:46,467
- Why now?
- Because I have nothing else.

1298
01:43:48,338 --> 01:43:51,535
All right, look, Ben. I'm not gonna lie to you.
You're good, you're very, very good.

1299
01:43:51,641 --> 01:43:55,805
But you did exactly what I told you not to.
You got emotional and then you got stupid.

1300
01:43:55,912 --> 01:43:59,609
Now you tell me why in the world
I'd ever get back in business with you.

1301
01:43:59,716 --> 01:44:04,176
Look, I know I should never have
disrespected you, all right? I know that.

1302
01:44:05,155 --> 01:44:07,123
With this facial recognition software,

1303
01:44:07,223 --> 01:44:10,420
our window of opportunity
is closing in on us.

1304
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:14,623
Now, I need this, Micky.
I really, really need this.

1305
01:44:14,731 --> 01:44:19,862
Well, the take would have to be really, really
good to get me even vaguely interested.

1306
01:44:21,371 --> 01:44:26,673
Well, you know, that's why I was thinking
maybe you should be the other big player.

1307
01:44:28,078 --> 01:44:31,411
You know, two big players playing big?

1308
01:44:32,582 --> 01:44:35,915
Hey, slow down,
I haven't played in a long time, Ben.

1309
01:44:40,356 --> 01:44:41,948
But Fisher's out.

1310
01:44:42,826 --> 01:44:47,195
No one else on the team
can be the big player, can they?

1311
01:44:50,433 --> 01:44:53,834
And if we do well, if we do really well,

1312
01:44:54,604 --> 01:44:57,766
then you get your grades back,
get to Harvard Med,

1313
01:44:58,774 --> 01:45:01,299
and I might even get that sabbatical.

1314
01:45:02,311 --> 01:45:06,771
Well, amazing things can be done
from the inside, right?

1315
01:45:08,717 --> 01:45:11,413
Just went back to the head of the class.

1316
01:45:12,688 --> 01:45:14,553
I gotta go be social.

1317
01:45:19,928 --> 01:45:23,227
All right, now listen.
It's different out there this time.

1318
01:45:23,332 --> 01:45:26,199
The stakes are high
and it's more dangerous.

1319
01:45:26,735 --> 01:45:29,795
But the return is gonna be the biggest.

1320
01:45:31,106 --> 01:45:34,542
Now they know our faces,
so we're gonna wear disguises.

1321
01:45:34,776 --> 01:45:36,744
And we can't mess around.

1322
01:45:37,112 --> 01:45:38,579
I'm glad you're back with us, Micky.

1323
01:45:38,680 --> 01:45:40,580
Well, I couldn't let you guys
come back to this town

1324
01:45:40,682 --> 01:45:44,174
and not prove to Ben
that I can do more than just teach.

1325
01:45:45,020 --> 01:45:48,922
But as we've all said, this game
is about the past and the future,

1326
01:45:49,024 --> 01:45:52,084
and tonight we forget about the past.

1327
01:45:52,327 --> 01:45:54,192
We just focus on the future.

1328
01:45:54,296 --> 01:45:57,629
Right. This is our last time.

1329
01:45:58,033 --> 01:46:01,059
Now, we all know the drill if things get ugly.
We meet at the Fox Strip Club.

1330
01:46:01,170 --> 01:46:03,502
Nobody leaves this town alone.

1331
01:46:06,974 --> 01:46:08,874
Let's go make a killing.

1332
01:46:09,410 --> 01:46:10,775
All right.

1333
01:46:32,900 --> 01:46:35,368
Let's see what we can do with this.

1334
01:46:44,478 --> 01:46:48,539
Seems like I'm having one of those days,
you know what I mean, Jim?

1335
01:46:50,218 --> 01:46:52,345
I'm bringing all the luck today.
I'm just bringing it all.

1336
01:46:52,453 --> 01:46:56,913
Anyone who's in any kind of contact
with me is getting so much luck today.

1337
01:47:08,569 --> 01:47:10,730
Winner, winner, chicken dinner! There it is.

1338
01:47:10,838 --> 01:47:14,274
Thank you. God, I love this town.
I love this game.

1339
01:47:15,076 --> 01:47:18,374
And, Jim, I might even love you.

1340
01:47:28,188 --> 01:47:30,383
Hey, you mind if I sit down?

1341
01:47:44,404 --> 01:47:45,462
What's your name?

1342
01:47:45,572 --> 01:47:48,700
Shane? I'm about to change your luck.
It's gonna become mine.

1343
01:47:48,808 --> 01:47:51,038
There you go, give me it all.

1344
01:48:01,087 --> 01:48:02,281
There you go.

1345
01:48:05,058 --> 01:48:06,821
Thank you. Thank you.

1346
01:48:11,564 --> 01:48:13,794
Such a shame, Shane!

1347
01:48:14,768 --> 01:48:16,827
Okay, I'm supposed to double, right?

1348
01:48:16,936 --> 01:48:21,270
- Is this your first time, darling?
- I've been winning and losing for hours.

1349
01:48:21,374 --> 01:48:23,467
Well, that's all right.
I've been winning and losing for years.

1350
01:48:36,789 --> 01:48:38,313
What the hell kind of streak
are you on, boy?

1351
01:48:38,424 --> 01:48:41,086
This never happens, this never happens.

1352
01:48:54,139 --> 01:48:55,936
I'm just gonna have to split those tens.

1353
01:48:56,041 --> 01:48:57,599
- Splitting tens.
- Splitting tens!

1354
01:48:57,710 --> 01:48:58,844
- Split tens!
- Again!

1355
01:48:58,844 --> 01:48:59,572
- Split tens!
- Again!

1356
01:49:22,501 --> 01:49:25,470
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Give me the chips, Blanca.

1357
01:49:26,705 --> 01:49:28,570
Give me the chips!
Come on, give me the chips, Blanca.

1358
01:49:28,674 --> 01:49:31,575
Come on, just give me the chips!

1359
01:49:31,677 --> 01:49:35,807
- My bus has to leave right away.
- I gotta walk my dog.

1360
01:49:35,914 --> 01:49:38,473
- I'm sorry we're making such a mess.
- Go, go, go, go, go.

1361
01:49:38,583 --> 01:49:41,643
Nice to see you. Have a good night, darling.

1362
01:49:47,191 --> 01:49:48,488
This way!

1363
01:49:59,704 --> 01:50:00,796
Go.

1364
01:50:15,153 --> 01:50:16,518
This way!

1365
01:50:22,427 --> 01:50:24,418
Come on, Jill. Come on!

1366
01:50:34,338 --> 01:50:36,932
Go that way. Throw me the chips.
Come on, we gotta separate.

1367
01:50:37,041 --> 01:50:39,908
Give me the chips, I'll meet you at Fox's.

1368
01:50:45,983 --> 01:50:47,575
Go, go, go, go!

1369
01:50:58,528 --> 01:51:00,189
Come on, come on.

1370
01:51:03,300 --> 01:51:04,858
Move, move, move!

1371
01:51:09,039 --> 01:51:10,301
Come on.

1372
01:51:11,441 --> 01:51:13,033
Go, go, this way.

1373
01:51:25,021 --> 01:51:26,852
All right, let's go.

1374
01:51:34,931 --> 01:51:37,422
Go, go, go, go! Airport!

1375
01:51:55,986 --> 01:51:57,613
<i>I never saw Micky Rosa after that.</i>

1376
01:52:02,691 --> 01:52:03,953
Oh, God.

1377
01:52:05,060 --> 01:52:07,324
But I think I wanna see him now.

1378
01:52:08,397 --> 01:52:10,865
And I want you to make that happen.

1379
01:52:15,137 --> 01:52:17,571
I don't work for Micky anymore.

1380
01:52:20,576 --> 01:52:22,009
Come on, kid.

1381
01:52:23,846 --> 01:52:27,612
Your picture's all over the database.
Your Vegas gig is done.

1382
01:52:28,651 --> 01:52:30,585
But I will give you one night.

1383
01:52:30,686 --> 01:52:33,746
And I can guarantee
that you won't be bothered.

1384
01:52:34,657 --> 01:52:38,423
You'll make a killing, and you'll keep it all.

1385
01:52:41,497 --> 01:52:42,691
Listen.

1386
01:52:44,266 --> 01:52:45,733
My name's Cole.

1387
01:52:47,303 --> 01:52:48,827
Cole Williams.

1388
01:52:50,739 --> 01:52:53,139
You just bring me Micky Rosa, kid.

1389
01:52:53,442 --> 01:52:55,467
I'll take care of the rest.

1390
01:52:58,013 --> 01:53:00,948
Son of a bitch.

1391
01:53:43,591 --> 01:53:45,354
Who the hell are you?

1392
01:54:08,216 --> 01:54:11,379
Ben. Good job.

1393
01:54:12,453 --> 01:54:17,516
You'll be glad to know I'm gonna have a talk
with your professor, and that MIT thing?

1394
01:54:17,725 --> 01:54:19,818
It's gonna work out for you.

1395
01:54:21,395 --> 01:54:22,953
So that's it?

1396
01:54:24,398 --> 01:54:27,162
- That's it.
- All right.

1397
01:54:28,135 --> 01:54:29,830
Oh, Dr. Campbell?

1398
01:54:31,171 --> 01:54:34,140
They don't have pensions
in my line of work.

1399
01:54:34,474 --> 01:54:36,374
And the software does
what it's supposed to do.

1400
01:54:36,476 --> 01:54:40,378
And I been chasing Micky Rosa around here
for too damn long.

1401
01:54:41,615 --> 01:54:43,879
I'm looking at some retirement.

1402
01:54:45,786 --> 01:54:47,253
Leave the bag.

1403
01:54:49,322 --> 01:54:51,620
No. No, no, no, no.

1404
01:54:51,725 --> 01:54:56,219
I need this money. You have no idea
what I went through to get this money.

1405
01:54:56,329 --> 01:55:01,323
I know, kid, but you're gonna figure out
how to get everything you want in this life,

1406
01:55:01,435 --> 01:55:03,164
'cause you're smart.

1407
01:55:04,738 --> 01:55:09,266
So, you're gonna leave the bag.

1408
01:55:14,314 --> 01:55:18,910
Ben, give him the bag. Give him the bag.
It doesn't matter. Give him the bag.

1409
01:55:27,761 --> 01:55:29,558
I knew you were smart.

1410
01:55:48,414 --> 01:55:51,144
<i>I had a 1590 on my SAT.</i>

1411
01:55:51,250 --> 01:55:53,309
<i>I got a 44 on my MCATs.</i>

1412
01:55:53,819 --> 01:55:56,947
<i>And I have a 4.0 GPA from MIT.</i>

1413
01:55:57,056 --> 01:55:59,524
<i>I thought I had my life mapped out.</i>

1414
01:56:01,427 --> 01:56:02,519
<i>But then I remembered</i>

1415
01:56:02,628 --> 01:56:06,086
<i>what my Nonlinear Equations professor
once told me,</i>

1416
01:56:06,632 --> 01:56:09,863
<i>"Always account for variable change."</i>

1417
01:56:11,670 --> 01:56:13,194
Hello, Micky.

1418
01:56:14,907 --> 01:56:16,738
Look, I got money in Boston.
A hundred grand.

1419
01:56:16,842 --> 01:56:18,867
I'll give it to you.
Just let me walk away. I'll walk away.

1420
01:56:18,978 --> 01:56:22,038
I don't want your money, Micky.
I don't need it.

1421
01:56:27,853 --> 01:56:30,651
But I know someone
who might be interested.

1422
01:56:31,023 --> 01:56:35,119
He's good with numbers, too.
He works for the IRS.

1423
01:56:43,935 --> 01:56:45,994
<i>I let down my good friends.</i>

1424
01:56:46,671 --> 01:56:51,608
<i>But as it turns out,
they weren't too bad at simple math either.</i>

1425
01:57:17,435 --> 01:57:19,995
<i>I scored the prettiest girl in school.</i>

1426
01:57:23,474 --> 01:57:26,102
<i>I got beaten down
by an old-school Vegas thug</i>

1427
01:57:26,211 --> 01:57:29,408
<i>who was having trouble
accepting his retirement.</i>

1428
01:57:30,715 --> 01:57:34,481
<i>But I worked out a deal with him
that got him a nice pension.</i>

1429
01:57:37,856 --> 01:57:40,654
<i>And I lied to my mother.</i>

1430
01:57:41,125 --> 01:57:44,822
<i>But I confessed the lie,
and, well, she still loved me.</i>

1431
01:58:01,345 --> 01:58:04,610
<i>So my senior year of college,
I joined this team.</i>

1432
01:58:05,015 --> 01:58:07,176
<i>And I learned this new skill.</i>

1433
01:58:07,417 --> 01:58:10,443
<i>I went to Vegas 17 times to use it.</i>

1434
01:58:12,623 --> 01:58:16,150
<i>I made hundreds of thousands of dollars
counting cards.</i>

1435
01:58:17,194 --> 01:58:19,754
And then I had it all stolen from me.

1436
01:58:20,697 --> 01:58:21,857
Twice.

1437
01:58:23,166 --> 01:58:27,262
How's that for life experience, professor?
Did I dazzle you?

1438
01:58:28,438 --> 01:58:30,963
Did I jump off the page?

1439
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:40,920
