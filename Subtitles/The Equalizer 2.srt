3
00:02:34,545 --> 00:02:36,277
Hot water, please.

4
00:02:39,215 --> 00:02:41,083
Excuse me?

5
00:02:43,654 --> 00:02:45,389
He said car is closed.

6
00:02:59,803 --> 00:03:01,737
He get for you.

7
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:03,908
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

8
00:03:05,275 --> 00:03:06,976
American?

9
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:08,410
Guilty.

10
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,754
First time to Turkey?

11
00:03:17,756 --> 00:03:20,125
No, no, no, no.

12
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:26,261
Been here...

13
00:03:26,263 --> 00:03:28,664
a long time ago.

14
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,835
- Different life.
- Mmm.

15
00:03:32,137 --> 00:03:34,837
- Now you come back.
- Yes.

16
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,172
Looking for something.

17
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:38,541
Hmm. Hey.

18
00:03:45,483 --> 00:03:46,682
My brother.

19
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:49,219
He say...

20
00:03:49,221 --> 00:03:52,122
you can find whatever you wish
in Turkey.

21
00:03:52,124 --> 00:03:53,723
- Yeah?
- Uh-huh.

22
00:03:53,725 --> 00:03:57,127
How about a man who kidnapped
his own daughter

23
00:03:57,129 --> 00:04:00,498
and took her away
from her American mother?

24
00:04:02,467 --> 00:04:04,034
An abusive man.

25
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:06,003
So not a real man.

26
00:04:06,005 --> 00:04:07,303
No love for the child.

27
00:04:07,305 --> 00:04:10,473
Just a need to punish
his ex-wife,

28
00:04:10,475 --> 00:04:12,176
to take the one thing away
from her

29
00:04:12,178 --> 00:04:14,244
that meant everything to her,

30
00:04:14,246 --> 00:04:17,981
with no intention
of returning the child.

31
00:04:17,983 --> 00:04:20,083
Do you think that...?

32
00:04:20,085 --> 00:04:21,754
Excuse me.

33
00:04:23,989 --> 00:04:26,590
Do you think I could find
that man in Turkey?

34
00:04:26,592 --> 00:04:28,492
Or maybe...

35
00:04:28,494 --> 00:04:30,761
on his way to Turkey?

36
00:04:30,763 --> 00:04:34,097
I, uh...

37
00:04:34,099 --> 00:04:37,369
would not be looking
for such a man.

38
00:04:38,437 --> 00:04:39,837
It would be...

39
00:04:41,774 --> 00:04:43,776
...dangerous.

40
00:04:45,278 --> 00:04:47,013
For you.

41
00:04:49,082 --> 00:04:50,882
Men like him
would think that.

42
00:04:50,884 --> 00:04:55,186
And, God as my witness,
I would give him a chance.

43
00:04:55,188 --> 00:04:56,923
To stop.

44
00:04:58,357 --> 00:05:00,792
To reconsider.

45
00:05:00,794 --> 00:05:03,897
To think about the worst thing
that could ever happen to him.

46
00:05:05,065 --> 00:05:07,100
To imagine that.

47
00:06:11,132 --> 00:06:14,533
There are two kinds of pain
in this world.

48
00:06:19,607 --> 00:06:21,475
Pain that hurts.

49
00:06:23,678 --> 00:06:25,314
Pain that alters.

50
00:06:28,851 --> 00:06:30,152
Today...

51
00:06:31,276 --> 00:06:32,876
...you get to choose.

52
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:15,396
Baby.

53
00:07:16,866 --> 00:07:18,232
Oh, baby.

54
00:07:18,234 --> 00:07:20,236
Oh, my God.

55
00:07:21,337 --> 00:07:22,336
Oh, God.

56
00:07:22,338 --> 00:07:23,570
Mom!

57
00:07:23,572 --> 00:07:25,373
Oh, my baby.

58
00:07:28,745 --> 00:07:30,913
- Are you okay?
- Mm-hmm.

59
00:07:33,082 --> 00:07:35,282
My baby.

60
00:07:35,284 --> 00:07:38,185
The State Department doesn't
know a thing about it, Grace.

61
00:07:38,187 --> 00:07:39,887
No one does.

62
00:07:39,889 --> 00:07:43,290
Just that 45 minutes ago,
someone delivered your daughter

63
00:07:43,292 --> 00:07:45,293
to the desk downstairs.

64
00:07:48,798 --> 00:07:50,631
Oh, I love you so much.

65
00:07:50,633 --> 00:07:52,600
I love you, I love you.

66
00:09:16,821 --> 00:09:18,321
My favorite driver.

67
00:09:18,323 --> 00:09:20,225
Always on time like clockwork.

68
00:09:22,561 --> 00:09:25,661
- Samuel.
- Ah, Roberto,

69
00:09:25,663 --> 00:09:28,164
it's not easy
getting in and out here.

70
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:29,233
Copy Center?

71
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,501
- Huh?
- Copy Center?

72
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:31,570
Yes.

73
00:09:32,704 --> 00:09:34,140
Lift off.

74
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:51,922
How am I today?

75
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,026
The same, only worse.

76
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:59,696
Every day, I know less.

77
00:09:59,698 --> 00:10:01,732
Welcome to the club.

78
00:10:18,717 --> 00:10:20,953
Thanks for the Lyft.

79
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,433
And a piece of advice.

80
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:38,536
Always be nice to anybody
who has access

81
00:10:38,538 --> 00:10:40,538
to your toothbrush.

82
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,811
Okay.

83
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:49,047
Thank you for this interview
and opportunity.

84
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:51,449
Now, as you can see
from my résumé...

85
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:53,552
No, no, no, no, no, no.

86
00:10:53,554 --> 00:10:56,323
Thank you for
this opportunity.

87
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,724
I have admired
your company's position

88
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:01,092
towards the environment
for quite some time,

89
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:02,461
and to be a part of that...

90
00:11:02,463 --> 00:11:03,462
Ma.

91
00:11:03,464 --> 00:11:05,331
Ma, I got accepted.

92
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:07,566
Yeah, I got accepted, Ma.

93
00:11:07,568 --> 00:11:09,834
I got...
"It is with great pleasure

94
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:12,003
"that we write
to offer you admission

95
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:15,140
to the College of Engineering,
class of 2019." Ma!

96
00:11:15,142 --> 00:11:18,177
Ma, Ma, I gotta
finish high school first. Yeah.

97
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:20,512
I don't get to
choose when I go, Tommy.

98
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:23,015
<i>- Right.</i>
- The Army does that.

99
00:11:23,017 --> 00:11:24,483
I'll text you
when I'm at the gate.

100
00:11:24,485 --> 00:11:25,750
- <i>Love you, Dad.</i>
- I love you both.

101
00:11:25,752 --> 00:11:27,453
Where you headed?

102
00:11:27,455 --> 00:11:29,421
Iraq.

103
00:11:29,423 --> 00:11:31,423
First tour?

104
00:11:31,425 --> 00:11:33,292
Yes, sir.

105
00:11:33,294 --> 00:11:35,294
I'll be there to pick you up
when you get back.

106
00:11:36,664 --> 00:11:37,999
Thank you.

107
00:11:55,684 --> 00:11:57,284
<i>Assalamu alaikum.</i>

108
00:11:57,286 --> 00:11:58,685
<i>Alaikum assalam.</i>

109
00:11:58,687 --> 00:12:00,052
How they coming?

110
00:12:00,054 --> 00:12:01,721
Left you something upstairs.

111
00:12:01,723 --> 00:12:03,523
- Did you?
- Mm-hmm.

112
00:12:03,525 --> 00:12:05,158
Thank you, Fatima.

113
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,792
You coming to the potluck?

114
00:12:06,794 --> 00:12:07,993
Yes, I'm coming.

115
00:12:07,995 --> 00:12:09,462
- Plates and napkins.
- All right.

116
00:12:09,464 --> 00:12:10,464
Napkins and plates.

117
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,402
And forks.

118
00:14:21,699 --> 00:14:23,634
Why are you doing this?

119
00:14:24,536 --> 00:14:27,169
I got your name on a piece
of paper in my pocket.

120
00:14:27,171 --> 00:14:28,471
It's all that matters.

121
00:14:31,108 --> 00:14:32,275
Hey, hey, hey.

122
00:14:32,277 --> 00:14:33,975
Look at me.

123
00:14:37,449 --> 00:14:39,482
No, no, no, no, no.
Stop talking.

124
00:14:39,484 --> 00:14:41,651
This is happening.

125
00:14:41,653 --> 00:14:43,553
Your son's gonna be home
any second.

126
00:14:43,555 --> 00:14:45,221
Right?

127
00:14:45,223 --> 00:14:48,658
- Open your mouth.
- No. No.

128
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,560
Open your mouth.

129
00:15:01,674 --> 00:15:03,372
You know what?
Weathermen are the best.

130
00:15:03,374 --> 00:15:04,908
Princess
hairdressers are the best.

131
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,209
- Weathermen are the best.
- No, dolphin trainers.

132
00:15:06,211 --> 00:15:07,678
Because you get to
play with...

133
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,378
Dolphin trainers
are totally the best.

134
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,881
And you don't have
to know anything...

135
00:15:10,883 --> 00:15:12,215
The princess hairdressers
are the best.

136
00:15:12,217 --> 00:15:13,684
...because there are screens
on the sides

137
00:15:13,686 --> 00:15:15,385
and the front, and you don't
even see anything.

138
00:15:15,387 --> 00:15:17,723
They are the best.
You get to curl their hair...

139
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:38,008
Hey.

140
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:40,577
Mr. McCall.

141
00:15:40,579 --> 00:15:42,346
Ordered a book last week.

142
00:15:42,348 --> 00:15:43,850
Oh, uh, yeah.

143
00:15:50,624 --> 00:15:52,055
McCall...

144
00:15:52,057 --> 00:15:54,358
I... I don't see it.

145
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,627
Um...

146
00:15:55,629 --> 00:15:57,396
I'll be right back.

147
00:16:04,236 --> 00:16:05,637
Man with the list.

148
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:07,372
"Hundred Books
Everyone Should Read."

149
00:16:07,374 --> 00:16:08,473
Guilty as charged.

150
00:16:08,475 --> 00:16:09,908
"In Search of Lost Time."

151
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,209
Came in yesterday.

152
00:16:11,211 --> 00:16:13,143
Thank you.

153
00:16:13,145 --> 00:16:14,614
What number?

154
00:16:15,749 --> 00:16:16,883
Last one.

155
00:16:18,285 --> 00:16:20,251
Well, I hope you start
another list.

156
00:16:20,253 --> 00:16:21,953
Me, too. How much?

157
00:16:21,955 --> 00:16:23,323
Uh, 40, please.

158
00:16:24,424 --> 00:16:25,659
Thank you.

159
00:16:29,796 --> 00:16:31,731
Sign is down?

160
00:16:33,099 --> 00:16:34,499
Sale sign.

161
00:16:34,501 --> 00:16:36,902
Oh, a change of circumstances.

162
00:16:36,904 --> 00:16:38,638
Not going anywhere now.

163
00:16:57,792 --> 00:16:59,758
I don't want a drink.

164
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,630
I don't want a drink.
I don't want a drink.

165
00:17:06,467 --> 00:17:08,000
"God...

166
00:17:08,002 --> 00:17:10,469
"grant me the serenity
to accept the things

167
00:17:10,471 --> 00:17:12,038
"that I cannot change,

168
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:15,010
"the courage to change
the things I can...

169
00:17:16,477 --> 00:17:18,880
...and the wisdom
to know the difference."

170
00:17:23,852 --> 00:17:25,517
Would you, um...

171
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:28,456
would you mind taking me
back where you picked me up?

172
00:17:50,078 --> 00:17:51,911
Just, other foot.

173
00:17:51,913 --> 00:17:52,913
Right there.

174
00:17:54,216 --> 00:17:55,749
Come on.

175
00:17:55,751 --> 00:17:57,717
You got it.

176
00:17:57,719 --> 00:17:59,386
Easy, easy.

177
00:17:59,388 --> 00:18:01,356
One step. Keep going.

178
00:18:04,426 --> 00:18:06,860
All right.

179
00:18:06,862 --> 00:18:08,664
There you go.

180
00:18:13,602 --> 00:18:16,569
Could you just help her
get in her apartment?

181
00:18:16,571 --> 00:18:17,940
Thanks.

182
00:18:55,946 --> 00:18:58,546
Stop cheating, bro.

183
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:06,320
How you doing?
I'm the, uh, Lyft driver

184
00:19:06,322 --> 00:19:08,556
that you called
to take home your girlfriend.

185
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:09,925
Not a girlfriend, man.

186
00:19:09,927 --> 00:19:11,793
- Just an intern.
- Oh. I'm sorry.

187
00:19:11,795 --> 00:19:14,730
The, uh, credit card
was invalid.

188
00:19:14,732 --> 00:19:17,132
Shithead.

189
00:19:17,134 --> 00:19:19,601
Let you hang with us
'cause your daddy's a client,

190
00:19:19,603 --> 00:19:21,268
and you fuck up
the first thing.

191
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,773
Come in.

192
00:19:31,081 --> 00:19:33,083
- There you go.
- Wow.

193
00:19:34,618 --> 00:19:35,617
I heard about these.

194
00:19:35,619 --> 00:19:36,985
I've never seen one before.

195
00:19:36,987 --> 00:19:38,453
Yeah, well, now you have.

196
00:19:38,455 --> 00:19:39,855
Yeah.

197
00:19:39,857 --> 00:19:41,690
Look, pay yourself whatever
and, uh,

198
00:19:41,692 --> 00:19:43,458
give yourself a nice tip,
huh?

199
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,928
Thank you. Thank you.

200
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:48,597
You're not gonna ask me
if she got home okay?

201
00:19:50,701 --> 00:19:52,168
She get home okay?

202
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:54,170
No.
Took her to Mass General.

203
00:19:54,172 --> 00:19:56,340
They're pumping her stomach
as we speak.

204
00:19:58,342 --> 00:20:00,542
What's her name?

205
00:20:00,544 --> 00:20:01,880
You don't know, do you?

206
00:20:03,047 --> 00:20:04,714
Okay.

207
00:20:04,716 --> 00:20:06,682
This is the point
where usually I'd, uh,

208
00:20:06,684 --> 00:20:08,651
give you a chance
to do the right thing,

209
00:20:08,653 --> 00:20:09,952
but not tonight.

210
00:20:09,954 --> 00:20:11,788
Tonight, I'm gonna need
your cameras,

211
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:13,689
cell phones,
anything you might've used

212
00:20:13,691 --> 00:20:16,227
to record
what you did to her.

213
00:20:46,826 --> 00:20:48,928
You knocked on
the wrong door tonight, pops.

214
00:21:01,607 --> 00:21:02,840
Oh, God!

215
00:21:02,842 --> 00:21:04,942
Jesus Christ!

216
00:21:04,944 --> 00:21:06,844
Come here.

217
00:21:17,556 --> 00:21:19,290
Get up.

218
00:21:19,292 --> 00:21:21,259
Get up.

219
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:26,967
Don't start crying now.
Give me your phone.

220
00:21:28,767 --> 00:21:30,701
Right or left?

221
00:21:30,703 --> 00:21:32,270
I don't know what you mean.

222
00:21:32,272 --> 00:21:34,138
Handed. Are you right-
or left-handed?

223
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,440
- Right.
- Call 911.

224
00:21:36,442 --> 00:21:39,077
You tell them the truth about
what happened in here tonight.

225
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:40,812
Your daddy's money is not
gonna save you this time.

226
00:21:40,814 --> 00:21:42,080
- You understand?
- Yes, sir.

227
00:21:42,082 --> 00:21:43,116
You know her name?

228
00:21:44,217 --> 00:21:46,450
No.

229
00:21:46,452 --> 00:21:48,454
Her name is Amy.
Give me your left hand.

230
00:21:52,158 --> 00:21:56,060
Give me your left hand.

231
00:21:59,099 --> 00:22:00,765
I expect a five-star rating.

232
00:22:00,767 --> 00:22:01,900
You understand?

233
00:22:01,902 --> 00:22:03,134
Yes, sir.

234
00:22:03,136 --> 00:22:05,271
Not for me, though.
For who?

235
00:22:05,273 --> 00:22:06,504
For Amy.

236
00:22:06,506 --> 00:22:07,739
That's right. For who?

237
00:22:07,741 --> 00:22:09,007
- For Amy.
- For who?

238
00:22:09,009 --> 00:22:10,410
For Amy.

239
00:22:17,285 --> 00:22:19,852
Make sure I get
a five-star rating, junior.

240
00:22:19,854 --> 00:22:21,289
Fuck.

241
00:23:35,097 --> 00:23:36,997
Hello, Susan.

242
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:38,266
What?

243
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:42,035
How in God's name
did you know it was me?

244
00:23:42,037 --> 00:23:43,437
I could smell you.

245
00:23:43,439 --> 00:23:45,439
I...
For God's sake, I just peed.

246
00:23:45,441 --> 00:23:49,743
Yeah, but you
ate asparagus vinaigrette

247
00:23:49,745 --> 00:23:51,112
with soy sauce.

248
00:23:51,114 --> 00:23:52,246
Oh, you.

249
00:23:52,248 --> 00:23:53,680
Oh, I smelled your perfume.

250
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,449
- How are you?
- Mmm. Oh...

251
00:23:55,451 --> 00:23:56,549
You good?

252
00:23:56,551 --> 00:23:57,617
Better now.

253
00:23:57,619 --> 00:23:59,020
Ah, very good.

254
00:23:59,022 --> 00:24:00,754
- Brought you something.
- Ah, soup.

255
00:24:00,756 --> 00:24:02,923
How'd that thing in Turkey
turn out?

256
00:24:02,925 --> 00:24:04,724
- Ah. Happy ending.
- Hmm.

257
00:24:04,726 --> 00:24:06,127
No pun intended.

258
00:24:06,129 --> 00:24:08,729
Well, I guess that means
you owe me dinner.

259
00:24:08,731 --> 00:24:10,798
I didn't agree to pay
for dinner. I, uh...

260
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,700
What, you gonna try
and weasel out of it?

261
00:24:12,702 --> 00:24:13,801
I'm not weaseling. I just...

262
00:24:13,803 --> 00:24:15,069
Oh, no, no, no, my friend.

263
00:24:15,071 --> 00:24:16,303
I don't work for free.

264
00:24:18,908 --> 00:24:20,708
How's Brian?

265
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:25,112
He's good.
Oh, he's got a new book out.

266
00:24:25,114 --> 00:24:26,481
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

267
00:24:26,483 --> 00:24:28,483
- Maybe I should read it, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

268
00:24:28,485 --> 00:24:30,885
You know,
if geopolitics of Nepal

269
00:24:30,887 --> 00:24:33,255
prior to the 1816
Sugauli Treaty

270
00:24:33,257 --> 00:24:34,755
is your bag, definitely.

271
00:24:36,126 --> 00:24:37,459
Friendship has its limits.

272
00:24:37,461 --> 00:24:38,592
So does matrimony.

273
00:24:38,594 --> 00:24:41,329
I haven't read it yet.

274
00:24:41,331 --> 00:24:42,965
Doubt I ever will.

275
00:24:44,101 --> 00:24:45,633
You here on business?

276
00:24:45,635 --> 00:24:46,769
Meetings.

277
00:24:49,139 --> 00:24:51,006
Meetings, huh?

278
00:24:51,008 --> 00:24:54,111
Well, birthdays
are the hardest.

279
00:24:57,281 --> 00:24:59,514
I know I always think
of my brother on his.

280
00:24:59,516 --> 00:25:01,316
Yeah.

281
00:25:01,318 --> 00:25:04,586
I was, uh, folding
laundry the other day,

282
00:25:04,588 --> 00:25:08,790
and, uh, I realized
that I didn't have

283
00:25:08,792 --> 00:25:12,994
any clothes left
that Vivienne had ever seen.

284
00:25:12,996 --> 00:25:15,797
I can't say
that's a bad thing.

285
00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:18,266
What?

286
00:25:18,268 --> 00:25:21,770
She didn't appreciate my taste
in clothing, either.

287
00:25:21,772 --> 00:25:24,940
I'd buy something,
the next day it was missing.

288
00:25:24,942 --> 00:25:27,143
I'd ask her about it,
and she'd say she didn't know

289
00:25:27,145 --> 00:25:29,178
what I was talking about,
and...

290
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:31,613
But she'd act like she didn't
know what I was talking about.

291
00:25:31,615 --> 00:25:33,882
I could tell. I mean, she's:
"I don't know what happened

292
00:25:33,884 --> 00:25:37,186
to those purple shirts
that you used to buy."

293
00:25:37,188 --> 00:25:41,625
And then I'd put one on
that she liked.

294
00:25:47,332 --> 00:25:48,533
What?

295
00:25:49,667 --> 00:25:51,469
I didn't say anything.

296
00:25:53,204 --> 00:25:55,404
I'm sorry if I made a mistake

297
00:25:55,406 --> 00:25:57,874
coming to you
on Vivienne's birthday.

298
00:25:57,876 --> 00:26:01,010
I just...
Robert, I've been thinking.

299
00:26:01,012 --> 00:26:03,482
Maybe you should go back, huh?

300
00:26:06,352 --> 00:26:09,252
It's great, you helping
all these random people

301
00:26:09,254 --> 00:26:12,188
and everything, but...

302
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:15,594
it's not gonna fill
that hole in your heart.

303
00:26:17,662 --> 00:26:19,596
Go home, huh?

304
00:26:19,598 --> 00:26:21,600
Make peace with it.

305
00:26:25,337 --> 00:26:27,573
That's what Vivienne
would have wanted.

306
00:26:29,275 --> 00:26:31,177
Oh, hey.

307
00:26:39,552 --> 00:26:42,019
- Always a gentleman.
- That's right.

308
00:26:42,021 --> 00:26:44,688
Hey, I'm obligated
to tell you these things,

309
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:46,723
being I'm the only friend
you got.

310
00:26:46,725 --> 00:26:47,725
Mmm.

311
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:52,898
Airport, please.

312
00:27:18,824 --> 00:27:20,959
Hey, Mr. McCall,
maybe you could find out

313
00:27:20,961 --> 00:27:23,163
who did this
to Fatima's garden.

314
00:27:28,001 --> 00:27:29,402
Kids.

315
00:27:51,091 --> 00:27:52,090
What up, man?

316
00:27:52,092 --> 00:27:53,692
How you doing?

317
00:27:58,499 --> 00:28:01,833
Hey. You should make
the building do that.

318
00:28:01,835 --> 00:28:03,535
It's what they supposed to.

319
00:28:03,537 --> 00:28:07,373
Ah, "supposed to do"
and "will do"

320
00:28:07,375 --> 00:28:09,608
are two different things,
Miles.

321
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:11,377
Yeah, but you live here,
right?

322
00:28:11,379 --> 00:28:13,545
That's right.
I pay the rent, too.

323
00:28:13,547 --> 00:28:15,681
You should let somebody else
do this, then.

324
00:28:15,683 --> 00:28:17,116
Like who?

325
00:28:17,118 --> 00:28:19,018
Shit, I don't know.

326
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,886
- Anybody.
- Huh?

327
00:28:20,888 --> 00:28:22,689
- Not a tenant.
- You're right.

328
00:28:22,691 --> 00:28:25,791
I guess anybody could do it,
but nobody does, Miles.

329
00:28:25,793 --> 00:28:28,127
Ends up with everybody
complaining

330
00:28:28,129 --> 00:28:31,631
because nobody did
what anybody could've done

331
00:28:31,633 --> 00:28:34,467
or should've done
to begin with.

332
00:28:34,469 --> 00:28:35,803
Yeah.

333
00:28:37,004 --> 00:28:38,540
A'ight.

334
00:28:40,207 --> 00:28:41,641
You know they got, uh...

335
00:28:41,643 --> 00:28:43,576
they got painting companies
around here.

336
00:28:43,578 --> 00:28:46,179
I know they charge $600, $700
to do the job.

337
00:28:46,181 --> 00:28:47,547
I know that.

338
00:28:47,549 --> 00:28:49,217
Word?

339
00:28:50,419 --> 00:28:53,153
Shit, I'll do this for 350.

340
00:28:53,155 --> 00:28:55,655
You?

341
00:28:55,657 --> 00:28:57,557
Yeah.

342
00:28:57,559 --> 00:28:59,025
- What?
- Nothing.

343
00:28:59,027 --> 00:29:01,194
What, I look handicapped
or something?

344
00:29:01,196 --> 00:29:02,762
Yo, it's a quick dip
and roll.

345
00:29:02,764 --> 00:29:04,197
It ain't rocket science.

346
00:29:04,199 --> 00:29:06,166
No, you're right.

347
00:29:06,168 --> 00:29:07,903
I'm an artist, man.

348
00:29:09,037 --> 00:29:10,272
I go to Bridgeview Arts.

349
00:29:12,274 --> 00:29:14,007
Why aren't you in school?

350
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:17,613
I don't be doing
all them everyday classes.

351
00:29:19,414 --> 00:29:22,450
You know, I got a...
got a special talent.

352
00:29:22,452 --> 00:29:24,385
Yes, you do.

353
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:26,254
And it takes talent
to make money.

354
00:29:28,591 --> 00:29:30,560
But it takes brains
to keep it, Miles.

355
00:29:32,894 --> 00:29:35,396
Yeah, well, I'm out here,
uh, making my money, man.

356
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:37,030
Short money, Miles.

357
00:29:37,032 --> 00:29:38,701
That's short money.

358
00:29:40,636 --> 00:29:42,605
I tell you what.

359
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:48,142
350's a little high...

360
00:29:48,144 --> 00:29:49,746
but I appreciate the offer.

361
00:29:51,647 --> 00:29:53,314
A'ight.

362
00:29:53,316 --> 00:29:54,951
- All right?
- A'ight.

363
00:29:57,553 --> 00:29:59,153
It's gonna be
a lot of work, man.

364
00:30:00,623 --> 00:30:02,760
- All right, Mr. McCall.
- All right.

365
00:30:24,815 --> 00:30:26,681
So you still out here
doing this?

366
00:30:26,683 --> 00:30:28,150
Yes, I am.

367
00:30:28,152 --> 00:30:29,917
You ain't covering nothing.

368
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:32,154
Not yet.

369
00:30:32,156 --> 00:30:34,156
What is this? Walmart paint?

370
00:30:34,158 --> 00:30:37,092
Primer. You gotta prime it
before you paint it.

371
00:30:37,094 --> 00:30:39,361
They don't teach you that
in art school?

372
00:30:39,363 --> 00:30:41,298
Yeah, I knew that.

373
00:30:43,802 --> 00:30:46,836
I've been thinking
about your offer.

374
00:30:46,838 --> 00:30:50,274
Been, uh, calibrating, uh...

375
00:30:51,375 --> 00:30:52,677
250.

376
00:30:54,478 --> 00:30:56,445
- 250?
- Yeah.

377
00:30:56,447 --> 00:30:58,883
250, I'll take care
of all of this for you.

378
00:31:00,017 --> 00:31:01,886
- For 250?
- Yeah.

379
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,554
All right.

380
00:31:04,556 --> 00:31:07,323
But you can only work on it
after school.

381
00:31:07,325 --> 00:31:09,625
- Sh...
- Don't curse.

382
00:31:09,627 --> 00:31:11,960
What time you get out?

383
00:31:11,962 --> 00:31:13,362
3:15.

384
00:31:13,364 --> 00:31:14,831
Okay, after school, 3:15.

385
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:16,165
Deal?

386
00:31:16,167 --> 00:31:17,567
Okay?

387
00:31:17,569 --> 00:31:19,204
A'ight.

388
00:31:20,338 --> 00:31:21,571
But cash, a'ight?

389
00:31:21,573 --> 00:31:23,573
Okay, cash.

390
00:31:23,575 --> 00:31:26,309
- Don't be checking me, a'ight?
- I'll be checking for you.

391
00:31:26,311 --> 00:31:27,677
A'ight.

392
00:31:29,514 --> 00:31:31,547
Miles.

393
00:31:31,549 --> 00:31:33,416
Stay off them corners, son.

394
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:38,654
<i>Gun oil on his lips.</i>

395
00:31:38,656 --> 00:31:42,726
<i>Nine-millimeter at his feet
was registered to the victim.</i>

396
00:31:42,728 --> 00:31:45,061
<i>No other prints in the house.</i>

397
00:31:45,063 --> 00:31:46,530
<i>You have questions?</i>

398
00:31:46,532 --> 00:31:48,765
Well, Mr. Calbert
did work for us,

399
00:31:48,767 --> 00:31:51,000
and when something occurs
to one of ours,

400
00:31:51,002 --> 00:31:52,836
the agency is obligated
to look into it.

401
00:31:52,838 --> 00:31:54,538
So yes, you will be
hearing from us.

402
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,205
- Thank you.
- Susan, Susan.

403
00:31:56,207 --> 00:31:58,342
Keep it locked down
until we get there, please.

404
00:31:58,344 --> 00:31:59,676
<i>I can't
find a file on this guy.</i>

405
00:31:59,678 --> 00:32:01,278
<i>When did he become one of ours?</i>

406
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,446
I don't know.

407
00:32:02,448 --> 00:32:04,080
Upstairs kept him off the radar

408
00:32:04,082 --> 00:32:05,682
- for some reason.
- Susan.

409
00:32:05,684 --> 00:32:07,417
- Car's here. Car's here.
- Oh. Oh, hey.

410
00:32:07,419 --> 00:32:09,086
- Oh, you look great.
- It's okay?

411
00:32:09,088 --> 00:32:10,187
- Well, what about a tie?
- Um...

412
00:32:10,189 --> 00:32:11,622
You need a tie, darling.

413
00:32:11,624 --> 00:32:12,856
<i>I'd do what she says.</i>

414
00:32:12,858 --> 00:32:13,957
- Uh...
- You have one?

415
00:32:13,959 --> 00:32:15,092
- Got it.
- Great. That's perfect.

416
00:32:15,094 --> 00:32:16,426
All right, I'll see you later.

417
00:32:16,428 --> 00:32:17,896
- Have fun, sweetheart.
- Bye-bye.

418
00:32:17,898 --> 00:32:19,730
Yeah, I'm gonna have
to go over there

419
00:32:19,732 --> 00:32:21,565
and cross the T's.
You want to come?

420
00:32:21,567 --> 00:32:24,234
<i>Oh, damn, and leave
this shitty office?</i>

421
00:32:24,236 --> 00:32:26,537
<i>You know, Brussels
has the best chocolates.</i>

422
00:32:26,539 --> 00:32:28,973
Mmm. Well, we'll go.
We'll find out.

423
00:32:28,975 --> 00:32:31,976
Today, I broke
a personal best:

424
00:32:31,978 --> 00:32:34,814
successive days alive.

425
00:32:35,949 --> 00:32:37,381
All right.

426
00:32:37,383 --> 00:32:40,250
Here, I got
photographic evidence.

427
00:32:40,252 --> 00:32:44,054
That's the portrait
of my sister, Magda.

428
00:32:44,056 --> 00:32:45,723
I was nine.

429
00:32:45,725 --> 00:32:47,157
The war came.

430
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:50,495
Like most families,
we were separated.

431
00:32:50,497 --> 00:32:54,933
My sister, Magda, and I
were sent to different camps.

432
00:32:54,935 --> 00:32:56,736
I never saw her again.

433
00:32:57,938 --> 00:33:01,739
60 years later, I'm in Paris,

434
00:33:01,741 --> 00:33:07,178
and I see somebody
auctioning my painting.

435
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:09,847
12 million. Can you imagine?

436
00:33:09,849 --> 00:33:14,085
"You got to have proof,"
they say, "to get it back."

437
00:33:14,087 --> 00:33:17,689
Now I got here the proof.

438
00:33:17,691 --> 00:33:21,492
Wait till the judge
sees this.

439
00:33:21,494 --> 00:33:25,163
Looks like there's
coming a storm.

440
00:33:25,165 --> 00:33:26,665
It's time for
your check-up, Sam.

441
00:33:26,667 --> 00:33:28,299
Oh.

442
00:33:28,301 --> 00:33:30,268
Hello, sweetheart.

443
00:33:35,543 --> 00:33:37,676
He's still obsessed
with the painting.

444
00:33:37,678 --> 00:33:39,511
Tried to help him years ago.

445
00:33:39,513 --> 00:33:41,380
He said he, uh,
had proof it was his

446
00:33:41,382 --> 00:33:43,147
even way back then.

447
00:33:43,149 --> 00:33:44,883
He didn't.

448
00:33:44,885 --> 00:33:47,553
No record, no bill of sales.

449
00:33:47,555 --> 00:33:50,324
He just keeps going back to
court to hear the same thing.

450
00:33:51,993 --> 00:33:54,793
Guess it gives him something
to focus on, I suppose.

451
00:33:54,795 --> 00:33:57,798
It helps when you have
nobody left, yeah?

452
00:34:05,539 --> 00:34:07,741
I thought the
reading went great.

453
00:34:07,743 --> 00:34:09,208
Embarrassing, actually.

454
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:11,143
- No.
- I signed two books.

455
00:34:11,145 --> 00:34:13,379
That's all.

456
00:34:13,381 --> 00:34:14,914
Thank you.

457
00:34:14,916 --> 00:34:17,083
You sure we can't drop you off
at the airport?

458
00:34:17,085 --> 00:34:18,484
No, I'm fine, Brian.
Thank you.

459
00:34:18,486 --> 00:34:19,919
- Thanks so much for coming.
- All right.

460
00:34:19,921 --> 00:34:21,253
- Good night.
- Good night.

461
00:34:21,255 --> 00:34:22,656
- Listen, do me a favor.
- Yeah?

462
00:34:22,658 --> 00:34:24,156
See what you can find out.

463
00:34:24,158 --> 00:34:25,358
Yeah?

464
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,926
Oh, another dinner, then.

465
00:34:26,928 --> 00:34:28,595
- I'll see what I can do.
- Yeah?

466
00:34:28,597 --> 00:34:30,664
I do fly off
to Brussels tomorrow.

467
00:34:30,666 --> 00:34:32,532
- Thought you were retired.
- Oh, I am.

468
00:34:32,534 --> 00:34:34,501
Just like you're dead.

469
00:34:34,503 --> 00:34:36,036
- Okay.
- Good night.

470
00:34:36,038 --> 00:34:37,439
Very good. Good night.

471
00:34:43,412 --> 00:34:46,746
I saw you
painting yesterday, Miles.

472
00:34:46,748 --> 00:34:48,415
It's primer.

473
00:34:48,417 --> 00:34:49,718
It ain't paint.

474
00:34:51,087 --> 00:34:53,353
So all this bullshit
under there...

475
00:34:53,355 --> 00:34:55,422
it don't show through.

476
00:34:55,424 --> 00:34:57,126
My brother painted that.

477
00:34:59,028 --> 00:35:01,461
It's the place we grew up.

478
00:35:01,463 --> 00:35:04,364
Yeah?
Well, you live here now.

479
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,970
Powder of some sort.

480
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:51,447
Hard drive contents
and cell records?

481
00:35:52,649 --> 00:35:55,085
You'll have them later today.

482
00:36:02,593 --> 00:36:03,927
Susan.

483
00:36:05,462 --> 00:36:08,295
Okay. Thank you.

484
00:36:08,297 --> 00:36:10,801
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

485
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:14,772
Merci.

486
00:36:16,473 --> 00:36:17,841
Right behind you.

487
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:34,023
I don't know.

488
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:36,691
Seems to me the judge...

489
00:36:36,693 --> 00:36:40,562
he didn't even pay
any attention to me.

490
00:36:40,564 --> 00:36:45,302
I mean, uh, he hardly looked
at all the evidence I had.

491
00:36:46,403 --> 00:36:48,171
Well, that's it.

492
00:36:48,173 --> 00:36:50,907
It was a very rare
painting, Sam.

493
00:36:50,909 --> 00:36:52,975
Maybe...
maybe that's the reason

494
00:36:52,977 --> 00:36:55,480
why it looks
so familiar to you.

495
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:13,596
This is my sister, Magda.

496
00:37:13,598 --> 00:37:17,201
Was younger, but that's
the only picture survived.

497
00:37:17,203 --> 00:37:18,835
Mmm.

498
00:37:18,837 --> 00:37:22,572
My uncle commissioned
the portrait

499
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:25,876
as a gift
for her 12th birthday.

500
00:37:25,878 --> 00:37:28,611
Was a young artist,
just beginning,

501
00:37:28,613 --> 00:37:31,782
but, oh,
you should have seen it.

502
00:37:31,784 --> 00:37:33,684
Not just the resemblance,

503
00:37:33,686 --> 00:37:36,720
but a spirit that shone
through it.

504
00:37:36,722 --> 00:37:39,959
It glowed, you know, like a beacon.

505
00:37:41,392 --> 00:37:44,094
"My little brother,"
she'd say, "my Sammy."

506
00:37:46,432 --> 00:37:48,868
I could never protect her.

507
00:37:50,035 --> 00:37:51,937
To lose her twice...

508
00:37:54,473 --> 00:37:56,276
I can't imagine.

509
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:00,477
<i>Hello, Susan.</i>

510
00:38:00,479 --> 00:38:02,813
<i>Hey. I had no idea
you were such an art lover.</i>

511
00:38:02,815 --> 00:38:05,382
That information you wanted
just came in.

512
00:38:05,384 --> 00:38:07,484
- Kind of surprising.
- <i>Okay.</i>

513
00:38:07,486 --> 00:38:09,087
I'm sending it to you
right now.

514
00:38:09,089 --> 00:38:10,288
<i>Good.</i>

515
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:11,622
- Yeah?
- Hey.

516
00:38:11,624 --> 00:38:14,458
Calbert's bank records
are fine.

517
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,995
Texts, e-mails.

518
00:38:16,997 --> 00:38:18,930
No marital discord.

519
00:38:18,932 --> 00:38:21,431
No girlfriends,
no boyfriends, no lovers.

520
00:38:21,433 --> 00:38:24,002
Not even an inappropriate
message to a coworker.

521
00:38:24,004 --> 00:38:25,670
And what about the wife?

522
00:38:25,672 --> 00:38:27,138
Oh, come on, Dave.

523
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:29,408
Women fuck around, too.

524
00:38:31,678 --> 00:38:33,478
I mean, think about it.

525
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:36,114
When's the last time you sent
your wife flowers, hmm?

526
00:38:36,116 --> 00:38:38,285
Noted. Noted.

527
00:38:41,955 --> 00:38:44,422
Data on Calbert's hard drive
just came in.

528
00:38:44,424 --> 00:38:46,258
No, we'll talk about it
on the plane.

529
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:48,426
I want to get out of here
as soon as we can.

530
00:38:48,428 --> 00:38:49,761
Run some theories by Stan.

531
00:38:51,798 --> 00:38:53,134
Pardon.

532
00:38:58,505 --> 00:38:59,972
Oh, uh... watch.

533
00:39:01,608 --> 00:39:03,441
Excusez-moi. Monsieur.

534
00:39:03,443 --> 00:39:05,346
Pardon. Merci.

535
00:39:06,981 --> 00:39:08,349
Pardon.

536
00:39:23,798 --> 00:39:25,631
I'll see you downstairs
at 6:00?

537
00:39:25,633 --> 00:39:27,199
You got it.

538
00:39:27,201 --> 00:39:29,336
Oh, hey, and how about
some of that delicious

539
00:39:29,338 --> 00:39:30,869
Belgian chocolate
you're always talking about?

540
00:39:30,871 --> 00:39:32,339
Or you're not getting
on the plane.

541
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:37,346
Guess I'm going back out.

542
00:39:53,362 --> 00:39:55,730
Oh, crap.

543
00:39:59,735 --> 00:40:01,535
Oh, great.

544
00:40:02,938 --> 00:40:04,204
Oh, my...!

545
00:40:12,881 --> 00:40:14,415
What do you want?

546
00:40:14,417 --> 00:40:15,882
- What do you...? No!
- Get up, bitch!

547
00:40:15,884 --> 00:40:17,019
You're-you're hurting me!

548
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:18,054
Where is the money?

549
00:40:18,078 --> 00:40:20,078
I don't have any money!

550
00:40:20,089 --> 00:40:21,329
Where is the money?

551
00:40:27,629 --> 00:40:30,264
Fucking why?
Who the fuck are you?

552
00:40:30,266 --> 00:40:32,699
Come on!

553
00:40:53,588 --> 00:40:55,656
No! Let me go!

554
00:41:05,635 --> 00:41:08,736
Brick will make this pop out.

555
00:41:08,738 --> 00:41:10,439
Picasso this entire building.

556
00:41:10,441 --> 00:41:11,839
Picasso it?

557
00:41:11,841 --> 00:41:13,241
- Yeah.
- Yeah, okay.

558
00:41:13,243 --> 00:41:14,775
How much?

559
00:41:14,777 --> 00:41:16,478
It's on the house.

560
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,081
I like that.

561
00:41:23,686 --> 00:41:25,287
You been drawing a long time?

562
00:41:25,289 --> 00:41:27,489
Since, uh...

563
00:41:27,491 --> 00:41:29,623
about third grade.

564
00:41:29,625 --> 00:41:31,495
What is this?

565
00:41:33,464 --> 00:41:35,931
That's how I sign my work.

566
00:41:35,933 --> 00:41:38,834
My brother, he was a boxer.

567
00:41:38,836 --> 00:41:40,471
It's the right hand of God.

568
00:41:41,872 --> 00:41:44,773
He catch you with it,
you know,

569
00:41:44,775 --> 00:41:47,375
you go to Heaven or, uh...

570
00:41:48,612 --> 00:41:49,880
Okay.

571
00:41:51,483 --> 00:41:53,951
- He still fighting?
- Uh...

572
00:41:55,319 --> 00:41:57,221
Somebody shot him.

573
00:41:58,456 --> 00:41:59,955
Coming back from the gym.

574
00:41:59,957 --> 00:42:01,792
Not even ganged up on
or nothing.

575
00:42:03,528 --> 00:42:06,063
Just wanted his gym bag.

576
00:42:14,472 --> 00:42:15,873
What?

577
00:42:17,908 --> 00:42:19,210
I didn't say anything.

578
00:42:20,512 --> 00:42:21,712
Anyway...

579
00:42:23,181 --> 00:42:26,082
My grandmother says,
if you don't...

580
00:42:26,084 --> 00:42:28,551
remember somebody out loud,

581
00:42:28,553 --> 00:42:31,189
they die twice.

582
00:42:33,925 --> 00:42:35,558
Grandmother was wise.

583
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:36,859
Hey, Brian.

584
00:42:36,861 --> 00:42:38,494
Y-Yeah, listen,
I'm-I'm reading

585
00:42:38,496 --> 00:42:40,732
your book right now,
and I can't believe you...

586
00:42:57,015 --> 00:42:58,384
Yeah.

587
00:43:07,426 --> 00:43:08,928
Yeah.

588
00:43:12,231 --> 00:43:13,698
Got it.

589
00:43:17,903 --> 00:43:19,538
Yo, Mr. McCall, you good?

590
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:23,309
Hey, yo, Mr. McCall.

591
00:44:08,321 --> 00:44:11,791
Oh, thanks, Dave.

592
00:44:30,810 --> 00:44:32,645
You know, the...

593
00:44:32,647 --> 00:44:36,382
the police in Brussels,
th-they say that...

594
00:44:36,384 --> 00:44:40,452
it happens in these hotels,
these robberies.

595
00:44:40,454 --> 00:44:43,457
But she never wore any jewelry.

596
00:44:44,725 --> 00:44:46,494
Not even a watch, and...

597
00:44:50,197 --> 00:44:51,999
Except for this.

598
00:44:55,136 --> 00:44:56,136
Here.

599
00:45:02,176 --> 00:45:04,178
What did the agency say?

600
00:45:05,346 --> 00:45:07,513
Uh, they said...

601
00:45:07,515 --> 00:45:10,249
they'd do everything
in their power.

602
00:45:10,251 --> 00:45:13,154
They're working
with Interpol.

603
00:45:15,022 --> 00:45:17,992
Promised to find
whoever it was.

604
00:45:19,494 --> 00:45:21,028
But...

605
00:45:24,865 --> 00:45:26,934
I don't know what to do now.

606
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:30,228
Where's the phone?

607
00:47:33,528 --> 00:47:34,728
Is it yours?

608
00:47:37,365 --> 00:47:38,465
It's not mine!

609
00:47:42,245 --> 00:47:43,745
Where the fuck is it?

610
00:48:42,735 --> 00:48:44,200
<i>Things to remember as the storm</i>

611
00:48:44,202 --> 00:48:45,702
<i>continues its march northward.</i>

612
00:48:45,704 --> 00:48:47,437
<i>We saw what Frances did</i>

613
00:48:47,439 --> 00:48:49,473
<i>in the southeast part
of the country.</i>

614
00:48:49,475 --> 00:48:51,475
<i>It appears to be moving here
as slowly</i>

615
00:48:51,477 --> 00:48:53,143
<i>as it left the Gulf Coast.</i>

616
00:48:53,145 --> 00:48:55,112
<i>That is what worries
meteorologists now.</i>

617
00:48:55,114 --> 00:48:57,982
<i>Even as the storm is moving
up the Eastern Seaboard,</i>

618
00:48:57,984 --> 00:49:00,083
<i>every city and town
that has been hit</i>

619
00:49:00,085 --> 00:49:02,821
<i>has experienced storm surge...</i>

620
00:49:05,224 --> 00:49:07,894
<i>...dangerous flood levels,
because the storm...</i>

621
00:49:09,896 --> 00:49:12,596
<i>National Guard has been
deployed in several states</i>

622
00:49:12,598 --> 00:49:14,567
<i>to prepare for lootings...</i>

623
00:49:50,470 --> 00:49:52,537
<i>Excusez-moi. Monsieur.</i>

624
00:49:52,539 --> 00:49:54,774
<i>Pardon. Merci.</i>

625
00:50:01,214 --> 00:50:03,147
<i>Watch.</i>

626
00:50:03,149 --> 00:50:08,152
<i>Excusez-moi. Monsieur.</i>

627
00:50:08,154 --> 00:50:09,788
<i>I'll see you downstairs
at 6:00?</i>

628
00:50:09,790 --> 00:50:11,657
<i>You got it.</i>

629
00:50:11,659 --> 00:50:13,993
<i>I'll see you
downstairs at 6:00?</i>

630
00:50:13,995 --> 00:50:15,362
<i>You got it.</i>

631
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:41,422
You got fat, Dave.

632
00:51:03,612 --> 00:51:05,745
I was in the same lobby

633
00:51:05,747 --> 00:51:07,747
when that bomb went off.

634
00:51:07,749 --> 00:51:09,718
Looking right at you...

635
00:51:11,586 --> 00:51:13,855
...when that hotel
came down on us.

636
00:51:17,426 --> 00:51:19,394
You were there,
and then you weren't.

637
00:51:21,063 --> 00:51:22,964
Wasn't my day.

638
00:51:25,634 --> 00:51:27,968
I went to your funeral.

639
00:51:27,970 --> 00:51:31,140
Grieved a long time over you.

640
00:51:35,410 --> 00:51:37,046
Susan, she knew?

641
00:51:40,649 --> 00:51:42,215
I was your partner
for seven years, Mac.

642
00:51:42,217 --> 00:51:43,550
I never kept anything
from you.

643
00:51:43,552 --> 00:51:45,653
I'm sorry, Dave.

644
00:51:45,655 --> 00:51:47,590
I am.

645
00:51:49,726 --> 00:51:53,561
I never had a chance
to say how sorry I was...

646
00:51:53,563 --> 00:51:55,396
about Vivienne.

647
00:51:59,168 --> 00:52:01,003
You still at the beach?

648
00:52:02,271 --> 00:52:03,673
Not in a long time.

649
00:52:05,108 --> 00:52:06,974
Well, I got me that cabin.

650
00:52:08,811 --> 00:52:12,348
Take the wife and kids up
a couple times a year.

651
00:52:13,783 --> 00:52:16,751
Wouldn't have any of it...

652
00:52:16,753 --> 00:52:18,788
if it weren't for Susan.

653
00:52:21,290 --> 00:52:23,193
Life got...

654
00:52:25,294 --> 00:52:26,930
...dark.

655
00:52:28,832 --> 00:52:31,632
She talked me off that ledge
I was heading over.

656
00:52:31,634 --> 00:52:34,537
Probably over a bowl of soup.

657
00:52:40,043 --> 00:52:41,979
I owe her my life.

658
00:52:44,181 --> 00:52:46,715
You ever talk to the boys?

659
00:52:46,717 --> 00:52:49,820
No, not for years.

660
00:52:52,389 --> 00:52:54,691
Hell of a team we were, right?

661
00:52:57,327 --> 00:52:59,128
She never pushed
a button, Dave.

662
00:52:59,130 --> 00:53:01,663
- Who?
- Susan.

663
00:53:01,665 --> 00:53:04,133
On the elevator.

664
00:53:04,135 --> 00:53:05,967
She never pushed
her floor number.

665
00:53:05,969 --> 00:53:08,737
I checked all the video.

666
00:53:08,739 --> 00:53:10,739
Backpackers got on first.

667
00:53:10,741 --> 00:53:12,474
They pushed number 16.

668
00:53:12,476 --> 00:53:14,977
She didn't have to.

669
00:53:14,979 --> 00:53:17,347
They knew what floor
she was on.

670
00:53:18,850 --> 00:53:20,417
They find 'em?

671
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:23,853
Pieces of them.

672
00:53:23,855 --> 00:53:25,587
Couple of tweakers.

673
00:53:25,589 --> 00:53:27,322
With sheets
as long as my arm.

674
00:53:27,324 --> 00:53:29,359
My good arm, anyway.

675
00:53:30,494 --> 00:53:32,394
Gas explosion.

676
00:53:32,396 --> 00:53:33,896
At least that's what
they're calling it.

677
00:53:33,898 --> 00:53:36,432
What do you call it?

678
00:53:36,434 --> 00:53:38,903
Tying up loose ends.

679
00:53:41,539 --> 00:53:43,439
Autopsy report.

680
00:53:43,441 --> 00:53:45,176
Stab wound.

681
00:53:46,344 --> 00:53:47,543
Two millimeters.

682
00:53:47,545 --> 00:53:49,412
The lower third rib.

683
00:53:49,414 --> 00:53:50,880
Close-quarter technique.

684
00:53:50,882 --> 00:53:52,615
Exactly. That was taught.

685
00:53:52,617 --> 00:53:55,718
This was no robbery.

686
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:57,455
Something else went on
in that room.

687
00:54:00,558 --> 00:54:03,262
Mac, whatever it is,
whatever you need...

688
00:54:05,898 --> 00:54:07,299
I'm in.

689
00:54:08,934 --> 00:54:10,200
I know.

690
00:54:10,202 --> 00:54:11,770
Same mud.

691
00:54:14,539 --> 00:54:17,309
Same blood.

692
00:54:38,631 --> 00:54:40,566
What's the deal, bruh?

693
00:57:40,650 --> 00:57:43,086
Listen. Uh...

694
00:57:44,854 --> 00:57:46,287
York.

695
00:57:46,289 --> 00:57:47,990
<i>Dave.</i>

696
00:57:49,792 --> 00:57:53,027
<i>Listen, the gun...</i>

697
00:57:53,029 --> 00:57:55,932
<i>next to Calbert
was on his right side.</i>

698
00:57:58,701 --> 00:58:00,968
He was right-handed. Why?

699
00:58:00,970 --> 00:58:04,106
His wife was shot
by somebody left-handed.

700
00:58:04,108 --> 00:58:06,043
Somebody else
was in that room.

701
00:58:08,345 --> 00:58:11,846
Powder residue came
from a latex glove.

702
00:58:11,848 --> 00:58:15,785
20,000 euros were found
in the backpackers' flat.

703
00:58:17,121 --> 00:58:19,189
- Hey, Bob.
- Dave.

704
00:58:21,692 --> 00:58:23,358
Those guys were set up.

705
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:25,894
Right. Agency assets
are taken out all the time.

706
00:58:25,896 --> 00:58:29,233
Opposite side
loves sending a message.

707
00:58:30,367 --> 00:58:31,702
Why stage it?

708
00:58:33,337 --> 00:58:35,403
They didn't know
he was one of ours.

709
00:58:35,405 --> 00:58:38,508
<i>Susan was about to figure out
who was in that room.</i>

710
00:58:38,510 --> 00:58:40,409
<i>That's why
she was killed, Dave.</i>

711
00:58:40,411 --> 00:58:42,411
<i>The two were connected.</i>

712
00:58:42,413 --> 00:58:45,348
I'll get back to you
when I know more.

713
00:58:45,350 --> 00:58:47,352
Keep me posted.

714
00:59:53,118 --> 00:59:55,385
Yo, man, elevator's closed.

715
01:00:08,901 --> 01:00:11,268
Listen up, little nigga.

716
01:00:11,270 --> 01:00:12,769
You ready to put in work?

717
01:00:12,771 --> 01:00:14,606
'Cause everybody in my camp
put in work.

718
01:00:14,608 --> 01:00:16,139
- One down little nigga.
- Ain't no snitchin'.

719
01:00:16,141 --> 01:00:17,821
- Ain't no bullshittin'.
- Clock in, nigga.

720
01:00:52,312 --> 01:00:53,978
Yo, what's up
with that bitch hit?

721
01:00:53,980 --> 01:00:55,513
Yeah, baby,
fucking hit that shit.

722
01:00:55,515 --> 01:00:56,715
You got it, little man.
Pass that bump.

723
01:00:56,717 --> 01:00:57,717
Let me get that, man.

724
01:01:03,156 --> 01:01:04,789
Hey, you all
right, little nigga?

725
01:01:04,791 --> 01:01:06,324
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
- Good?

726
01:01:06,326 --> 01:01:08,661
- You sure? It's all that.
- A'ight.

727
01:01:08,663 --> 01:01:10,061
Listen, man.
You know you gotta

728
01:01:10,063 --> 01:01:11,730
spin the bend tonight, right?

729
01:01:11,732 --> 01:01:13,365
You know you gotta
spin the bend.

730
01:01:13,367 --> 01:01:15,833
- Yeah.
- Didn't them niggas kill your brother?

731
01:01:15,835 --> 01:01:17,636
- You gotta empty the whole thing on 'em.
- Yeah.

732
01:01:17,638 --> 01:01:19,003
Right.

733
01:01:19,005 --> 01:01:20,972
You gotta go take care
of that tonight.

734
01:01:20,974 --> 01:01:22,508
Run down on them niggas.

735
01:01:22,510 --> 01:01:24,042
Make sure you kill one
of them ill niggas tonight.

736
01:01:24,044 --> 01:01:26,878
Make sure you empty
that whole thing.

737
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:29,014
Yo, listen.

738
01:01:29,016 --> 01:01:31,750
Your mother already
buried your brother.

739
01:01:31,752 --> 01:01:34,320
Don't have her bury two sons.

740
01:01:34,322 --> 01:01:35,988
You hear me?

741
01:01:35,990 --> 01:01:37,323
Yeah.

742
01:01:37,325 --> 01:01:38,924
Don't come back
without it empty.

743
01:01:38,926 --> 01:01:40,061
That's a fact, B.

744
01:01:42,663 --> 01:01:44,430
- Shit.
- Let's go, Miles.

745
01:01:44,432 --> 01:01:46,599
- Holy shit.
- Sit down. Sit down. Sit down.

746
01:01:46,601 --> 01:01:48,434
- Sit down.
- Who the fuck is this nigga?

747
01:01:48,436 --> 01:01:49,602
I'm your father.

748
01:01:49,604 --> 01:01:51,538
Your mommy
just didn't tell you.

749
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:54,609
Let's go, Miles.
Let's go, Miles.

750
01:01:58,245 --> 01:02:00,714
Let's go, Miles.

751
01:02:00,716 --> 01:02:02,081
Do you know this nigga?

752
01:02:02,083 --> 01:02:03,785
Yo, where you going, B?

753
01:02:05,019 --> 01:02:07,387
Yeah?

754
01:02:07,389 --> 01:02:08,790
Shit.

755
01:02:10,225 --> 01:02:13,293
- Bam.
- Yo, who the fuck was that, yo?

756
01:02:13,295 --> 01:02:16,096
Yo, what
the fuck happened, yo?

757
01:02:16,098 --> 01:02:18,264
- What the fuck is going on, yo?
- The fuck happened to you?

758
01:02:18,266 --> 01:02:21,301
- Come on.
- Yo, get the fuck off of me, man.

759
01:02:21,303 --> 01:02:22,902
Huh?

760
01:02:22,904 --> 01:02:24,804
Do you know
where the fuck we at?

761
01:02:24,806 --> 01:02:26,973
I know. Do you?
I know where we are.

762
01:02:26,975 --> 01:02:28,942
This what you want?
Is it what you want?

763
01:02:28,944 --> 01:02:31,244
I thought you wanted to draw.
Isn't that what you said?

764
01:02:31,246 --> 01:02:32,445
- Draw?
- Yeah.

765
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:33,947
Paint?

766
01:02:33,949 --> 01:02:35,783
Yeah.

767
01:02:35,785 --> 01:02:37,651
What the fuck
is that gonna get me?

768
01:02:37,653 --> 01:02:41,822
That shit about to put food
on my fucking ma's table?

769
01:02:41,824 --> 01:02:43,491
Huh?

770
01:02:43,493 --> 01:02:46,596
That shit gonna pay
the fucking bills?

771
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:49,262
Nah.

772
01:02:49,264 --> 01:02:51,264
You need to be a gangster.
You need to be a killer.

773
01:02:51,266 --> 01:02:53,334
Little Yummy, huh?
You need them.

774
01:02:53,336 --> 01:02:55,168
Okay,
if that's what you want.

775
01:02:55,170 --> 01:02:58,172
If that's what makes you feel
like a man, then be a real man.

776
01:02:58,174 --> 01:02:59,640
Let's get jumped in
right now.

777
01:02:59,642 --> 01:03:00,808
- Here. Start with me.
- No.

778
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:01,908
No, start with me.

779
01:03:01,910 --> 01:03:03,344
- Here. Start with me.
- No.

780
01:03:03,346 --> 01:03:04,512
- No, take it.
- No, no.

781
01:03:04,514 --> 01:03:05,912
Come on, killer.
Come on, killer.

782
01:03:05,914 --> 01:03:06,913
Come on, killer.

783
01:03:06,915 --> 01:03:08,115
Put it right there.

784
01:03:08,117 --> 01:03:09,583
- No.
- You know how to hold it?

785
01:03:09,585 --> 01:03:10,684
You know what you're doing?

786
01:03:10,686 --> 01:03:11,819
Come on, killer.

787
01:03:11,821 --> 01:03:13,187
There you go.

788
01:03:13,189 --> 01:03:16,592
There you go. There you go.

789
01:03:18,762 --> 01:03:20,995
Five pounds of pressure...
that's all it takes.

790
01:03:20,997 --> 01:03:22,798
Come on, gangster.

791
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:25,032
Five pounds of pressure...
that's all it takes.

792
01:03:25,034 --> 01:03:26,835
- Five pounds of pressure.
- Fuck.

793
01:03:26,837 --> 01:03:29,003
That's all it takes.

794
01:03:29,005 --> 01:03:30,672
All right.
Come on, give it to me.

795
01:03:30,674 --> 01:03:32,339
You don't want it.
Give it to me.

796
01:03:32,341 --> 01:03:35,376
Come on, give it to me.
I ain't gonna do nothing to it.

797
01:03:35,378 --> 01:03:37,446
See? You know
what they are up there?

798
01:03:37,448 --> 01:03:39,113
They're liars, and so am I.

799
01:03:39,115 --> 01:03:41,015
- Hey, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.
- See? See what happens

800
01:03:41,017 --> 01:03:42,983
- when you deal with a liar?
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

801
01:03:42,985 --> 01:03:44,653
Huh? You see what happens
when you deal with a liar?

802
01:03:44,655 --> 01:03:45,720
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

803
01:03:45,722 --> 01:03:46,822
I lied to your little punk ass.

804
01:03:46,824 --> 01:03:48,223
- A'ight.
- Now I'm-a kill you.

805
01:03:48,225 --> 01:03:49,891
What do you see when you
look at me? Tell me.

806
01:03:49,893 --> 01:03:51,359
- You better give me a right answer.
- I don't know.

807
01:03:51,361 --> 01:03:52,561
- I don't know.
- What you see when you

808
01:03:52,563 --> 01:03:54,129
- look at me, killer?
- I don't know!

809
01:03:54,131 --> 01:03:55,230
- What you see, Yummy?
- I don't know.

810
01:03:55,232 --> 01:03:56,164
- You don't know?
- I don't know.

811
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:57,499
I don't know.

812
01:03:57,501 --> 01:03:58,667
All right?

813
01:03:58,669 --> 01:04:01,138
"Man" ain't spelled G-U-N, son.

814
01:04:03,707 --> 01:04:05,507
You got a choice.

815
01:04:05,509 --> 01:04:07,375
You got talent.

816
01:04:07,377 --> 01:04:09,411
You got a chance,
and I don't want to hear about

817
01:04:09,413 --> 01:04:11,046
your environment and what
your mama didn't give you

818
01:04:11,048 --> 01:04:12,682
and the white man
won't give you no shot.

819
01:04:12,684 --> 01:04:14,349
You got a chance.

820
01:04:14,351 --> 01:04:16,652
Use it while you still alive.

821
01:04:16,654 --> 01:04:19,321
You don't know what death is.

822
01:04:19,323 --> 01:04:21,826
You have no idea what death is.

823
01:04:23,994 --> 01:04:25,761
Make a decision.

824
01:04:25,763 --> 01:04:27,699
All right.

825
01:04:33,705 --> 01:04:35,440
Hey, yo, Mr. McCall.

826
01:04:37,609 --> 01:04:39,175
Why me?

827
01:04:39,177 --> 01:04:41,044
Why not you?

828
01:04:46,384 --> 01:04:48,586
But... but why me?

829
01:04:49,854 --> 01:04:51,689
Let's find out together.

830
01:04:57,228 --> 01:04:58,896
<i>And with a storm this size,</i>

831
01:04:58,898 --> 01:05:00,696
<i>that surge could be
as much as six feet.</i>

832
01:05:00,698 --> 01:05:03,099
<i>It's the speed of the hurricane
and that giant eye</i>

833
01:05:03,101 --> 01:05:05,134
<i>that could absolutely
deluge the coast.</i>

834
01:05:11,544 --> 01:05:13,442
<i>...and the fact
that it's moving so slowly,</i>

835
01:05:13,444 --> 01:05:15,044
<i>appears in no hurry to move on.</i>

836
01:05:15,046 --> 01:05:16,780
<i>Waiting in
on the press conference</i>

837
01:05:16,782 --> 01:05:18,281
<i>of the governor
about the continuing efforts</i>

838
01:05:18,283 --> 01:05:19,750
<i>to prepare for the storm...</i>

839
01:05:28,427 --> 01:05:30,629
- Hello?
- Mr. McCall?

840
01:05:32,231 --> 01:05:33,897
Who is it?

841
01:05:33,899 --> 01:05:35,634
It's me, Miles.

842
01:05:39,005 --> 01:05:40,737
I finished the bricks
outside.

843
01:05:40,739 --> 01:05:42,107
Yeah, I saw it.

844
01:05:44,143 --> 01:05:47,680
Oh, uh, this is your change
for the extra paint.

845
01:05:48,949 --> 01:05:50,649
- That's all of it?
- Yeah.

846
01:05:53,152 --> 01:05:56,654
So, anyway, uh...

847
01:05:56,656 --> 01:05:58,756
you have something to drink?

848
01:05:58,758 --> 01:06:01,027
Yes, I do.

849
01:06:02,829 --> 01:06:04,862
- Would you like something to drink?
- Yeah.

850
01:06:04,864 --> 01:06:06,265
Come on in.

851
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:10,300
Iced tea or water?

852
01:06:10,302 --> 01:06:13,006
What I look like, Jackie Chan?

853
01:06:20,146 --> 01:06:22,048
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

854
01:06:24,484 --> 01:06:27,318
Yo, you know
they sell these in sets.

855
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:28,688
Yeah.

856
01:06:41,902 --> 01:06:43,301
What you making?

857
01:06:43,303 --> 01:06:44,839
Arroz con pollo.

858
01:06:46,007 --> 01:06:47,572
Yeah, Moms makes
the same thing.

859
01:06:47,574 --> 01:06:49,808
- Does she?
- Yeah, she puts some...

860
01:06:49,810 --> 01:06:51,510
I'm not your moms.

861
01:06:51,512 --> 01:06:53,646
And that's not your pot.

862
01:06:53,648 --> 01:06:55,981
And this is not your house.

863
01:06:55,983 --> 01:06:57,148
You understand?

864
01:06:57,150 --> 01:06:58,819
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Okay.

865
01:07:07,828 --> 01:07:09,595
Yo, this wall
need a paint job.

866
01:07:09,597 --> 01:07:11,263
Yeah, it does.

867
01:07:11,265 --> 01:07:12,665
Yeah.

868
01:07:12,667 --> 01:07:14,533
- I could do it for you.
- Could you?

869
01:07:14,535 --> 01:07:16,069
Yeah.

870
01:07:16,071 --> 01:07:17,271
How much?

871
01:07:18,673 --> 01:07:21,074
If I could get a plate
of that food...

872
01:07:23,177 --> 01:07:25,111
Yeah, man...

873
01:07:25,113 --> 01:07:28,948
No, seriously, uh, 115.

874
01:07:28,950 --> 01:07:31,417
That cool?

875
01:07:31,419 --> 01:07:33,755
All right,
I'll make a deal with you.

876
01:07:35,222 --> 01:07:36,623
115, huh?

877
01:07:36,625 --> 01:07:37,957
Yeah.

878
01:07:37,959 --> 01:07:39,861
Here you go. Free.

879
01:07:41,362 --> 01:07:43,129
Read that. Can you read?

880
01:07:43,131 --> 01:07:44,866
- Yeah.
- What does it say?

881
01:07:46,768 --> 01:07:48,968
Ta-Nehisi Coates,
"Between the World and Me."

882
01:07:48,970 --> 01:07:50,070
All right.

883
01:07:50,072 --> 01:07:51,873
You read that, we got a deal.

884
01:07:56,611 --> 01:07:57,911
Airport?

885
01:07:57,913 --> 01:07:59,145
Yeah.

886
01:07:59,147 --> 01:08:01,414
Is it somebody's birthday?

887
01:08:01,416 --> 01:08:03,150
My daughter.

888
01:08:03,152 --> 01:08:04,720
Nice.

889
01:08:07,456 --> 01:08:08,657
How old is she?

890
01:08:10,425 --> 01:08:11,660
She's five.

891
01:09:10,286 --> 01:09:13,855
Guess you don't fly
that often, huh?

892
01:09:13,857 --> 01:09:16,191
Been driving in the opposite
direction of Logan

893
01:09:16,193 --> 01:09:17,493
for the last three minutes.

894
01:09:48,659 --> 01:09:49,726
Hey!

895
01:11:48,949 --> 01:11:50,949
Um, no crust, either.

896
01:11:50,951 --> 01:11:53,151
- Eat up, sweetie.
- Mom? Mom says I have to go

897
01:11:53,153 --> 01:11:54,552
to the dentist.

898
01:11:54,554 --> 01:11:56,020
She never has to go
to the dentist.

899
01:11:56,022 --> 01:11:57,722
- That's gotta be the gardener?
- Grapes.

900
01:11:57,724 --> 01:11:59,844
- Can I have a treat?
- You know where the grapes are.

901
01:12:02,629 --> 01:12:05,297
Oh, my God.

902
01:12:05,299 --> 01:12:08,400
My life... is so hard.

903
01:12:08,402 --> 01:12:09,734
Here's your grapes.

904
01:12:09,736 --> 01:12:11,636
- What...?
- Come on.

905
01:12:11,638 --> 01:12:13,138
- Show me what you can do.
- But...

906
01:12:13,140 --> 01:12:14,872
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

907
01:12:14,874 --> 01:12:16,375
Come on.

908
01:12:16,377 --> 01:12:17,744
Hi, baby.

909
01:12:19,679 --> 01:12:21,881
Mommy made a nice map.

910
01:12:23,017 --> 01:12:25,084
"A. Maine." Very good.

911
01:12:25,086 --> 01:12:27,585
"B. New Hams..."

912
01:12:27,587 --> 01:12:28,921
"New Hamster."

913
01:12:28,923 --> 01:12:32,191
Carol, who is it?

914
01:12:36,197 --> 01:12:38,030
Carol?

915
01:12:39,734 --> 01:12:41,700
It's New Hampshire,
not New Hamster.

916
01:12:41,702 --> 01:12:44,770
But I like it as "New Hamster."

917
01:12:44,772 --> 01:12:46,872
Okay, you leave it
"New Hamster."

918
01:12:46,874 --> 01:12:48,540
Honey, the front
doorbell is broken.

919
01:12:48,542 --> 01:12:50,509
Your old Army buddy
was at the back door

920
01:12:50,511 --> 01:12:52,077
for almost five minutes.

921
01:12:52,079 --> 01:12:54,414
Actually, I was his team leader
seven years.

922
01:12:54,416 --> 01:12:56,383
Oh, my...
Baby, I'm so sorry.

923
01:12:56,385 --> 01:12:58,251
I must have forgot...
this is...

924
01:12:58,253 --> 01:13:00,586
I got the days mixed up.
This is Robert McCall.

925
01:13:00,588 --> 01:13:02,355
- This is my wife, Carol.
- Hi.

926
01:13:02,357 --> 01:13:04,391
- Hi. Pleasure to meet you.
- My pleasure. Thanks.

927
01:13:04,393 --> 01:13:05,624
These are...
these are our daughters.

928
01:13:05,626 --> 01:13:07,060
- Molly, Alice.
- Hi. Hi.

929
01:13:07,062 --> 01:13:08,594
- Come here, baby. Come here.
- How are you?

930
01:13:08,596 --> 01:13:10,096
- Please make yourself at home.
- Say hi to...

931
01:13:10,098 --> 01:13:11,697
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.
- Call him Mac.

932
01:13:11,699 --> 01:13:13,599
- Do you want some coffee?
- Uh, no. I'm fine, thank you.

933
01:13:13,601 --> 01:13:15,068
Sorry about the mess.

934
01:13:15,070 --> 01:13:16,469
- We were just...
- No problem, no problem.

935
01:13:16,471 --> 01:13:17,871
I gotta get these two
off to school.

936
01:13:17,873 --> 01:13:19,538
- Okay.
- Girls, let's go.

937
01:13:19,540 --> 01:13:21,474
Out of these pajamas.

938
01:13:24,780 --> 01:13:26,079
Nice.

939
01:13:26,081 --> 01:13:27,480
Robert, nice to meet you.

940
01:13:27,482 --> 01:13:28,948
Oh, my pleasure.

941
01:13:28,950 --> 01:13:30,250
- All righty.
- Sit down. Come here.

942
01:13:30,252 --> 01:13:31,584
Yep.

943
01:13:31,586 --> 01:13:32,919
Take these off. Let's go.

944
01:13:32,921 --> 01:13:34,721
- You all right?
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

945
01:13:34,723 --> 01:13:36,389
Give those teeth a brush.

946
01:13:38,260 --> 01:13:40,093
You got a beautiful family.

947
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:41,294
Thanks.

948
01:13:41,296 --> 01:13:42,929
What's going on?

949
01:13:42,931 --> 01:13:44,900
Uh...

950
01:13:47,135 --> 01:13:51,004
I took this off the guy...

951
01:13:51,006 --> 01:13:52,672
who tried to kill me
yesterday.

952
01:13:52,674 --> 01:13:54,241
It's like you said...
they're cleaning up.

953
01:13:54,243 --> 01:13:56,743
Everybody who's looking
into the Brussels hit...

954
01:13:56,745 --> 01:13:58,245
nobody's safe.

955
01:13:58,247 --> 01:14:00,247
You, your family.

956
01:14:00,249 --> 01:14:01,614
Nobody.

957
01:14:01,616 --> 01:14:03,284
That's military-grade
encryption.

958
01:14:03,286 --> 01:14:04,985
You should take it
to your office,

959
01:14:04,987 --> 01:14:06,854
run the numbers and, uh,

960
01:14:06,856 --> 01:14:10,024
check the names against
the passenger manifests

961
01:14:10,026 --> 01:14:13,327
in and out of Brussels in the
days surrounding the flight.

962
01:14:13,329 --> 01:14:15,996
Whoever we're looking for
made calls to that phone.

963
01:14:15,998 --> 01:14:17,867
I'm on it. I'm on it.

964
01:14:47,630 --> 01:14:49,832
Tell me I'm wrong, Dave.

965
01:14:51,135 --> 01:14:53,036
You gonna answer it?

966
01:14:58,809 --> 01:15:00,911
What happened, Dave?

967
01:15:06,583 --> 01:15:08,385
You died.

968
01:15:15,993 --> 01:15:17,895
That's what happened.

969
01:15:20,063 --> 01:15:24,199
Three months after you...
mmm, disappeared,

970
01:15:24,201 --> 01:15:27,102
government shut us down.

971
01:15:27,104 --> 01:15:29,340
I went private right after.

972
01:15:31,209 --> 01:15:34,177
Doing the same things you and I
did for God and country...

973
01:15:34,179 --> 01:15:36,045
killing names
on a piece of paper.

974
01:15:36,047 --> 01:15:37,846
Only now...

975
01:15:37,848 --> 01:15:40,216
now there's a price
next to them.

976
01:15:40,218 --> 01:15:43,052
- We killed the enemy.
- Who said they were the enemy?

977
01:15:43,054 --> 01:15:44,389
Not us. Not me.

978
01:15:47,125 --> 01:15:49,760
We just followed orders.

979
01:15:52,263 --> 01:15:53,963
Mac...

980
01:15:53,965 --> 01:15:56,732
there are no good
and bad people anymore.

981
01:15:56,734 --> 01:15:58,067
No.

982
01:15:58,069 --> 01:15:59,869
No enemies.

983
01:15:59,871 --> 01:16:02,405
Just...

984
01:16:02,407 --> 01:16:04,207
unfortunates.

985
01:16:04,209 --> 01:16:05,977
And Susan?

986
01:16:08,447 --> 01:16:10,649
Unfortunate.

987
01:16:14,886 --> 01:16:17,387
<i>No one
knew the Brussels contract</i>

988
01:16:17,389 --> 01:16:19,658
<i>was a deep agency asset.</i>

989
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:24,994
<i>Susan was gonna figure out
who was in that dining room.</i>

990
01:16:24,996 --> 01:16:27,964
<i>She was the only one
who could have, right?</i>

991
01:16:27,966 --> 01:16:30,502
<i>Until you crawled out
of your grave.</i>

992
01:16:35,574 --> 01:16:37,142
You get the chocolate?

993
01:16:41,947 --> 01:16:43,249
Oh, fuck.

994
01:16:59,432 --> 01:17:02,469
Susan worked
in a dangerous world, Mac.

995
01:17:04,304 --> 01:17:06,203
Could have happened anytime
by anybody.

996
01:17:06,205 --> 01:17:07,938
But it wasn't anybody;
it was you.

997
01:17:07,940 --> 01:17:09,509
Just...

998
01:17:13,779 --> 01:17:16,616
You spare me the righteous
bullshit, all right?

999
01:17:18,685 --> 01:17:21,052
You do what you have to do,
and you move on.

1000
01:17:21,054 --> 01:17:23,488
There's no moving on
from this, Dave.

1001
01:17:23,490 --> 01:17:25,156
We all gotta pay
for our sins.

1002
01:17:25,158 --> 01:17:26,391
Oh, yeah,
what about you?

1003
01:17:26,393 --> 01:17:27,992
Do you deserve to die
for yours?

1004
01:17:27,994 --> 01:17:28,993
Hundred times over.

1005
01:17:28,995 --> 01:17:30,561
Oh. All right.

1006
01:17:30,563 --> 01:17:32,830
Well, guess what.

1007
01:17:32,832 --> 01:17:34,702
There is no sin.

1008
01:17:37,404 --> 01:17:39,039
No virtue.

1009
01:17:41,575 --> 01:17:44,477
It's just shit people do.

1010
01:17:46,246 --> 01:17:48,846
They trained us
to kill people

1011
01:17:48,848 --> 01:17:51,350
and risk our lives doing it,
and then one day,

1012
01:17:51,352 --> 01:17:53,851
you get a call
saying they're done with you.

1013
01:17:53,853 --> 01:17:56,921
"Thank you for your service.
Here's a plaque."

1014
01:17:56,923 --> 01:17:58,990
You need a job?
Good luck.

1015
01:17:58,992 --> 01:18:01,861
You need medical insurance?
See the VA.

1016
01:18:05,433 --> 01:18:07,266
See, one day,
you're an asset.

1017
01:18:07,268 --> 01:18:10,504
The next, you're
a fucking afterthought.

1018
01:18:14,508 --> 01:18:17,411
It was a natural evolution.
It's who we were.

1019
01:18:19,046 --> 01:18:21,748
It's what we did.
It's what you did.

1020
01:18:21,750 --> 01:18:23,515
Now it's what we do.

1021
01:18:23,517 --> 01:18:25,617
"We"?

1022
01:18:25,619 --> 01:18:27,922
It's not just me, Mac.

1023
01:18:30,458 --> 01:18:31,890
It's all of us.

1024
01:18:31,892 --> 01:18:33,626
Ari, Resnik, Kovac.

1025
01:18:33,628 --> 01:18:35,262
All of us.

1026
01:18:36,931 --> 01:18:39,133
Family.

1027
01:18:58,253 --> 01:18:59,619
Gentlemen.

1028
01:18:59,621 --> 01:19:01,721
Mac.

1029
01:19:01,723 --> 01:19:04,724
You look pretty good
for a dead guy.

1030
01:19:04,726 --> 01:19:08,430
We all want you to know
none of this is, uh, personal.

1031
01:19:10,165 --> 01:19:12,833
What you do, what you
become is not my concern.

1032
01:19:12,835 --> 01:19:15,168
The world is full
of so-called men like you.

1033
01:19:15,170 --> 01:19:17,738
And in a perfect world,

1034
01:19:17,740 --> 01:19:20,841
everything we do
comes with a price, but...

1035
01:19:20,843 --> 01:19:22,743
this ain't a perfect world.

1036
01:19:22,745 --> 01:19:24,512
People do bad things.

1037
01:19:24,514 --> 01:19:27,481
If you're lucky,
you get a chance to...

1038
01:19:27,483 --> 01:19:29,115
set it right.

1039
01:19:29,117 --> 01:19:32,655
But most of the time,
it goes unpunished.

1040
01:19:34,290 --> 01:19:36,357
This ain't
one of them times.

1041
01:19:36,359 --> 01:19:39,527
The mistake you made
was you killed my friend,

1042
01:19:39,529 --> 01:19:42,363
so I'm going to kill
each and every one of you,

1043
01:19:42,365 --> 01:19:44,331
and the only disappointment
in it for me

1044
01:19:44,333 --> 01:19:45,965
is that I only get
to do it once.

1045
01:19:45,967 --> 01:19:47,967
Train's gotta go.

1046
01:19:47,969 --> 01:19:50,004
Alice has music practice
at 7:45.

1047
01:19:50,006 --> 01:19:52,306
- Hey, Ari, fellas.
- Hey, Carol.

1048
01:19:52,308 --> 01:19:54,108
Robert, hope
to see you again.

1049
01:19:54,110 --> 01:19:56,477
Nice to meet you, too.

1050
01:19:56,479 --> 01:19:58,379
Uh...

1051
01:19:58,381 --> 01:20:02,283
Dave said you could give me
a lift to the, uh, station?

1052
01:20:02,285 --> 01:20:04,351
- Bye, Daddy.
- Bye, Dad.

1053
01:20:04,353 --> 01:20:05,887
Help and company?

1054
01:20:05,889 --> 01:20:07,356
Let's go.

1055
01:20:08,491 --> 01:20:09,891
See?

1056
01:20:09,893 --> 01:20:11,992
Help and company.

1057
01:20:11,994 --> 01:20:13,494
You take the little one.

1058
01:20:13,496 --> 01:20:14,498
Okay.

1059
01:20:19,736 --> 01:20:21,672
Come on.

1060
01:20:26,376 --> 01:20:28,710
See you at work.

1061
01:20:44,896 --> 01:20:48,663
Look, I don't think my wife
had a favorite.

1062
01:20:48,665 --> 01:20:51,568
She never gave a lot of thought
to clothes.

1063
01:20:54,739 --> 01:20:56,238
I'm fine.

1064
01:20:56,240 --> 01:20:58,442
I'll bring something over
in the morning.

1065
01:23:15,548 --> 01:23:17,250
Who's coming after me?

1066
01:23:18,752 --> 01:23:21,254
The men who killed Susan.

1067
01:23:23,090 --> 01:23:24,391
Why?

1068
01:23:25,993 --> 01:23:28,663
Because you're a loose end.

1069
01:23:58,793 --> 01:24:00,426
What's up, Miles?

1070
01:24:00,428 --> 01:24:01,927
<i>Hey, yo, what up, man?</i>

1071
01:24:01,929 --> 01:24:03,729
Where are you?

1072
01:24:03,731 --> 01:24:05,431
<i>Yeah, I'm at your crib,
actually.</i>

1073
01:24:05,433 --> 01:24:07,533
All right, listen, son.
I don't have time right...

1074
01:24:07,535 --> 01:24:08,801
<i>Finishing up these walls.</i>

1075
01:24:08,803 --> 01:24:10,736
Going with
the spearmint green.

1076
01:24:10,738 --> 01:24:13,305
Yo, you got any food
around here? I'm starving.

1077
01:24:21,083 --> 01:24:23,783
<i>What's all that barking?</i>

1078
01:24:23,785 --> 01:24:26,385
<i>Go to the window.
Tell me what you see.</i>

1079
01:24:26,387 --> 01:24:28,387
Yeah.

1080
01:24:28,389 --> 01:24:31,290
Hey, these dogs outside
going crazy.

1081
01:24:31,292 --> 01:24:33,225
<i>Listen. Hey.
Out toward the street...</i>

1082
01:24:33,227 --> 01:24:34,828
<i>tell me what you see.</i>

1083
01:24:34,830 --> 01:24:38,398
Oh, it's just some dude
out here delivering pizza.

1084
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:39,499
<i>Hang on.</i>

1085
01:25:08,698 --> 01:25:11,531
Hey, yo.

1086
01:25:11,533 --> 01:25:13,536
Hey, yo, Mr. McCall.

1087
01:25:15,204 --> 01:25:16,873
Shit.

1088
01:25:17,974 --> 01:25:20,107
Oh, shit.

1089
01:25:20,109 --> 01:25:22,843
<i>Hey, Mr. McCall, I think
somebody's trying to get ins...</i>

1090
01:25:22,845 --> 01:25:24,612
Miles, listen to me
real carefully.

1091
01:25:24,614 --> 01:25:26,280
Go to the bedroom.
Go to my bedroom.

1092
01:25:26,282 --> 01:25:27,481
You'll see a bookshelf.

1093
01:25:27,483 --> 01:25:28,516
- <i>Go.</i>
- Yo, what?

1094
01:25:28,518 --> 01:25:30,218
<i>Just go.</i>

1095
01:25:30,220 --> 01:25:31,685
- Hey, yo, what...?
- <i>Miles.</i>

1096
01:25:31,687 --> 01:25:34,622
- A'ight. A'ight.
- <i>Miles. See it?</i>

1097
01:25:34,624 --> 01:25:36,657
- Yeah.
- <i>All right.</i>

1098
01:25:36,659 --> 01:25:39,326
<i>Middle shelf, there's a book by
Richard Wright, "Native Son."</i>

1099
01:25:39,328 --> 01:25:41,729
- What?
- Listen. Just do what I tell you.

1100
01:25:41,731 --> 01:25:43,364
"Native Son." "Native Son."

1101
01:25:43,366 --> 01:25:45,033
- <i>Pull it out.</i>
- What, you want me to read it?

1102
01:25:45,035 --> 01:25:46,567
Pull the book out.
You'll see a button behind it.

1103
01:25:46,569 --> 01:25:48,471
<i>I want you to push the button.</i>

1104
01:25:54,745 --> 01:25:56,410
<i>You're gonna push the button.
It'll open up.</i>

1105
01:25:56,412 --> 01:25:58,849
<i>You go inside.
You close the door behind you.</i>

1106
01:26:01,484 --> 01:26:02,853
A'ight.

1107
01:26:06,256 --> 01:26:07,591
<i>Man. Oh, man, oh, man.</i>

1108
01:26:32,016 --> 01:26:33,882
Yo, what is this place?

1109
01:26:33,884 --> 01:26:35,684
<i>All right, calm down,
calm down.</i>

1110
01:26:35,686 --> 01:26:37,552
Just sit down. Be quiet.

1111
01:26:37,554 --> 01:26:39,088
<i>Be very quiet.</i>

1112
01:26:39,090 --> 01:26:40,424
<i>Don't move.</i>

1113
01:26:46,898 --> 01:26:48,563
Hey, Mr. McCall.

1114
01:26:48,565 --> 01:26:50,532
Yo, who are these people?

1115
01:26:50,534 --> 01:26:52,369
<i>Let me worry about that.</i>

1116
01:27:04,782 --> 01:27:05,950
Clear.

1117
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:22,565
<i>Calm down.</i>

1118
01:27:22,567 --> 01:27:24,669
- <i>Get in the hole. Go inside.</i>
- All right.

1119
01:27:27,306 --> 01:27:29,739
Yo, man, I don't do well
in small spaces, man.

1120
01:27:29,741 --> 01:27:31,241
Yo, I can't even breathe, man.

1121
01:27:31,243 --> 01:27:33,343
<i>Son, son, slow down.</i>

1122
01:27:33,345 --> 01:27:36,348
Fucking lungs is...
is closing up and shit.

1123
01:27:50,696 --> 01:27:52,596
He's looking right at me.

1124
01:27:52,598 --> 01:27:54,365
<i>Don't worry about him.
It's a two-way mirror.</i>

1125
01:27:54,367 --> 01:27:56,334
<i>You can see them.
They can't see you.</i>

1126
01:27:56,336 --> 01:27:57,634
Man, it's too dark in here.

1127
01:27:57,636 --> 01:27:58,936
Yo, I can't even feel my legs.

1128
01:27:58,938 --> 01:28:00,837
I can't even see my feet.

1129
01:28:00,839 --> 01:28:03,143
<i>Relax. Just breathe.
Don't talk too loud.</i>

1130
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:09,813
Turn your phone off.
They'll see the light.

1131
01:28:09,815 --> 01:28:11,149
Turn it off.

1132
01:28:11,151 --> 01:28:12,484
Fuck.

1133
01:28:16,222 --> 01:28:18,191
Fuck.

1134
01:29:08,775 --> 01:29:10,541
<i>How you doing, Dave?</i>

1135
01:29:10,543 --> 01:29:12,444
<i>You know who it is.</i>

1136
01:29:12,446 --> 01:29:14,079
Listen, since you're
in my house,

1137
01:29:14,081 --> 01:29:15,848
water my plants for me,
will you?

1138
01:29:15,850 --> 01:29:17,950
'Cause I'm not gonna be back
for a while.

1139
01:29:29,764 --> 01:29:32,765
It's a mistake to go to war
with us, McCall.

1140
01:29:32,767 --> 01:29:34,133
You got it backwards, Dave.

1141
01:29:34,135 --> 01:29:35,636
You're going to war with me.

1142
01:29:37,571 --> 01:29:40,375
You know where I'll be.

1143
01:30:16,178 --> 01:30:18,413
I know where he's headed.

1144
01:30:20,816 --> 01:30:22,418
He's going home.

1145
01:31:30,187 --> 01:31:31,588
Hey, kid.

1146
01:31:33,756 --> 01:31:35,325
Back up.

1147
01:31:51,108 --> 01:31:53,375
- The town's evacuated.
- How you doing, Officer?

1148
01:31:53,377 --> 01:31:55,210
Just got off a double shift.
Just gonna check

1149
01:31:55,212 --> 01:31:58,280
- and see if I left my gas on.
- All right, make it quick.

1150
01:31:58,282 --> 01:32:00,882
Let the gray BMW through.

1151
01:32:00,884 --> 01:32:02,453
<i>Copy that.</i>

1152
01:32:59,245 --> 01:33:01,179
What do we have here?

1153
01:33:05,817 --> 01:33:07,517
I need you to turn around.

1154
01:33:07,519 --> 01:33:08,654
Town's been evacuated.

1155
01:33:44,857 --> 01:33:47,059
Where are you?

1156
01:33:58,705 --> 01:34:00,373
Slow down.

1157
01:34:06,546 --> 01:34:09,013
That was his wife's bakery.

1158
01:34:09,015 --> 01:34:10,583
Go.

1159
01:34:14,654 --> 01:34:16,189
Pull over here.

1160
01:34:33,774 --> 01:34:35,206
<i>Clear the alley.</i>

1161
01:34:35,208 --> 01:34:37,077
<i>Mac's house is back there.</i>

1162
01:34:54,195 --> 01:34:56,230
<i>Making entry, yellow house.</i>

1163
01:34:58,399 --> 01:35:00,067
<i>All clear. Coming out.</i>

1164
01:35:13,948 --> 01:35:15,650
<i>Taking high ground.</i>

1165
01:36:03,498 --> 01:36:05,465
<i>I got movement... 12:00.</i>

1166
01:36:05,467 --> 01:36:07,770
<i>Kovac, move in.</i>

1167
01:36:09,271 --> 01:36:11,539
<i>Ari, what's your sitrep?</i>

1168
01:36:11,541 --> 01:36:13,643
Locking down, south side.

1169
01:36:25,822 --> 01:36:28,023
<i>Making entry, north side.</i>

1170
01:37:57,282 --> 01:37:58,948
Kovac.

1171
01:37:58,950 --> 01:38:00,550
<i>Kovac!</i>

1172
01:38:00,552 --> 01:38:02,485
<i>Kovac, come back!</i>

1173
01:38:02,487 --> 01:38:04,287
<i>Shots fired!</i>

1174
01:38:04,289 --> 01:38:05,922
Shots fired! I'm going in.

1175
01:38:05,924 --> 01:38:07,924
Going in.

1176
01:38:07,926 --> 01:38:09,258
York, you got eyes on him?

1177
01:38:09,260 --> 01:38:11,095
I see him.

1178
01:38:20,071 --> 01:38:21,907
Making entry, north side.

1179
01:38:23,008 --> 01:38:24,509
Fuck.

1180
01:38:33,418 --> 01:38:34,987
Ah, fuck.

1181
01:38:36,120 --> 01:38:37,420
Kovac's down. He's gone.

1182
01:38:37,422 --> 01:38:39,489
<i>- Say again.</i>
- Kovac.

1183
01:38:39,491 --> 01:38:41,190
<i>He's down. He's fucked.</i>

1184
01:38:41,192 --> 01:38:44,327
<i>Push towards the ocean.</i>

1185
01:38:44,329 --> 01:38:47,433
<i>Repeat... push
towards the ocean.</i>

1186
01:39:31,044 --> 01:39:32,879
What the fuck?

1187
01:40:14,622 --> 01:40:16,454
<i>Ari.</i>

1188
01:40:16,456 --> 01:40:17,925
<i>Resnik! Somebody talk to me.</i>

1189
01:40:19,060 --> 01:40:20,061
Ari.

1190
01:40:22,295 --> 01:40:24,230
Son of a bitch!

1191
01:40:34,041 --> 01:40:36,875
Ari's down! Ari's down!

1192
01:40:36,877 --> 01:40:39,547
<i>And Mac made
a fucking mess of him!</i>

1193
01:40:41,382 --> 01:40:43,549
There's pictures of Susan
everywhere.

1194
01:40:43,551 --> 01:40:46,086
<i>He's picking us apart, man.</i>

1195
01:40:46,088 --> 01:40:48,090
I need fucking eyes!

1196
01:41:35,604 --> 01:41:37,439
Goddamn it!

1197
01:41:41,543 --> 01:41:44,477
I'm on the southwest corner
of the yellow building.

1198
01:41:44,479 --> 01:41:47,047
I got a blood trail...
looks like he's headed

1199
01:41:47,049 --> 01:41:49,049
- <i>across the main drag.</i>
- Rear of the bakery.

1200
01:41:49,051 --> 01:41:50,686
<i>Copy that.</i>

1201
01:42:54,685 --> 01:42:56,117
Move inside, Resnik.

1202
01:42:56,119 --> 01:42:57,721
<i>Move inside.</i>

1203
01:43:49,474 --> 01:43:51,310
Resnik, do you copy?

1204
01:43:52,810 --> 01:43:54,112
Resnik!

1205
01:43:55,180 --> 01:43:56,514
<i>Come back!</i>

1206
01:44:10,296 --> 01:44:12,097
Fuck!

1207
01:44:24,944 --> 01:44:26,543
Just me and you, Dave.

1208
01:44:26,545 --> 01:44:27,945
<i>Nobody's left.</i>

1209
01:44:27,947 --> 01:44:29,548
Not exactly.

1210
01:44:39,458 --> 01:44:41,725
<i>Remember what you taught me.</i>

1211
01:44:41,727 --> 01:44:44,463
Always have
a contingency plan.

1212
01:44:51,137 --> 01:44:52,738
<i>Come on, Mac.</i>

1213
01:44:53,906 --> 01:44:55,976
<i>Show yourself.</i>

1214
01:45:19,699 --> 01:45:21,766
<i>I don't know
who the kid is, Mac,</i>

1215
01:45:21,768 --> 01:45:23,868
or if he means
anything to you.

1216
01:45:23,870 --> 01:45:26,405
I took the chance
that he matters.

1217
01:45:28,108 --> 01:45:29,540
I'll make it simple.

1218
01:45:29,542 --> 01:45:31,009
Step out, show yourself,

1219
01:45:31,011 --> 01:45:33,345
and I won't kill the kid.

1220
01:45:45,960 --> 01:45:47,727
The wind makes it interesting.

1221
01:45:49,529 --> 01:45:51,796
Side mirror.

1222
01:45:53,868 --> 01:45:55,434
Two more.
Third one goes through

1223
01:45:55,436 --> 01:45:56,871
the middle of the trunk.

1224
01:46:04,078 --> 01:46:05,744
Taillight.

1225
01:46:08,249 --> 01:46:11,118
I was a hair off on that one.
I might've hit the kid.

1226
01:46:16,891 --> 01:46:17,956
All right!

1227
01:46:17,958 --> 01:46:19,727
Time's up, Mac.

1228
01:46:31,672 --> 01:46:33,672
Nice move, Mac.

1229
01:46:33,674 --> 01:46:36,278
But it's not gonna make
any difference.

1230
01:46:38,914 --> 01:46:40,815
Where are you,
you son of a bitch?

1231
01:47:12,215 --> 01:47:14,215
Fuck you, Mac!

1232
01:47:14,217 --> 01:47:16,683
Fuck you!

1233
01:47:16,685 --> 01:47:20,987
You couldn't save your wife,
you couldn't save Susan,

1234
01:47:20,989 --> 01:47:23,857
and you're not gonna save
this fucking kid.

1235
01:47:23,859 --> 01:47:27,128
Is that in your playbook?

1236
01:47:27,130 --> 01:47:29,563
Is that in
your fucking playbook?

1237
01:47:29,565 --> 01:47:32,068
Show yourself!

1238
01:49:20,245 --> 01:49:22,278
All right, take your time.

1239
01:49:22,280 --> 01:49:23,913
Right here.

1240
01:49:23,915 --> 01:49:25,582
Sit down right here.

1241
01:49:36,328 --> 01:49:37,962
There we go.

1242
01:49:42,867 --> 01:49:44,603
Put this on.

1243
01:49:47,038 --> 01:49:49,506
All right.

1244
01:49:49,508 --> 01:49:51,308
There you go.

1245
01:49:51,310 --> 01:49:52,777
Let's see.

1246
01:49:53,878 --> 01:49:55,712
Ah...

1247
01:49:55,714 --> 01:49:57,648
Yeah, it went in and out.

1248
01:49:57,650 --> 01:49:59,018
It's not bad.

1249
01:50:02,688 --> 01:50:04,488
- Hey, yo.
- Yeah?

1250
01:50:04,490 --> 01:50:06,523
My moms is gonna be pissed.

1251
01:50:06,525 --> 01:50:08,726
Yeah, I'll talk to her.

1252
01:50:08,728 --> 01:50:10,794
Yo, not at me, man.

1253
01:50:10,796 --> 01:50:13,530
- At you.
- You talk to her, then.

1254
01:50:13,532 --> 01:50:14,632
A'ight.

1255
01:50:14,634 --> 01:50:15,667
Count to three.

1256
01:50:15,669 --> 01:50:17,367
- One, two, three.
- Three.

1257
01:50:20,906 --> 01:50:22,205
- It's all good.
- Yep.

1258
01:50:22,207 --> 01:50:23,574
I got your back.

1259
01:50:23,576 --> 01:50:25,042
I appreciate it.

1260
01:50:25,044 --> 01:50:26,877
Hey, Mr. McCall.

1261
01:50:26,879 --> 01:50:28,080
Yeah?

1262
01:50:29,982 --> 01:50:32,184
Who are you, man?

1263
01:51:26,474 --> 01:51:29,141
- Hey, Mr. McCall.
- Yeah?

1264
01:51:29,143 --> 01:51:31,744
I think the bleeding stopped.

1265
01:51:31,746 --> 01:51:33,880
Good. Good.

1266
01:51:38,452 --> 01:51:39,718
Sit down.

1267
01:51:39,720 --> 01:51:41,487
This your place?

1268
01:51:41,489 --> 01:51:43,255
Yes, it is.

1269
01:51:43,257 --> 01:51:45,626
Come on, sit down.

1270
01:52:33,208 --> 01:52:35,177
What are you drawing?

1271
01:52:37,646 --> 01:52:39,014
I'm, uh...

1272
01:52:40,549 --> 01:52:43,684
I'm working on
a superhero character.

1273
01:52:43,686 --> 01:52:46,054
- What's his power?
- What's his power?

1274
01:52:47,523 --> 01:52:50,156
He knows things
before you do.

1275
01:52:50,158 --> 01:52:52,526
You know,
he has, uh...

1276
01:52:52,528 --> 01:52:55,563
secret rooms,
magic locks.

1277
01:52:55,565 --> 01:52:57,731
You know,
shit like that.

1278
01:52:57,733 --> 01:53:00,200
S-St-Stuff like that.

1279
01:53:00,202 --> 01:53:01,968
He fly?

1280
01:53:01,970 --> 01:53:03,671
Nah.

1281
01:53:03,673 --> 01:53:06,674
He act-actually drives
a Malibu.

1282
01:53:06,676 --> 01:53:09,243
That's funny?

1283
01:53:09,245 --> 01:53:11,812
Honestly... that's cool.

1284
01:53:11,814 --> 01:53:13,814
- Okay.
- I love it.

1285
01:53:13,816 --> 01:53:16,853
Oh, respect.
I-I appreciate that.

1286
01:53:55,392 --> 01:53:58,527
So... so you
can understand, um,

1287
01:53:58,529 --> 01:54:02,364
that when a resident,
uh, says things

1288
01:54:02,366 --> 01:54:07,536
that are, um...
that are grandiose by nature,

1289
01:54:07,538 --> 01:54:10,038
we tend to dismiss it.

1290
01:54:10,040 --> 01:54:14,409
So you can imagine how, um,
surprised we were today

1291
01:54:14,411 --> 01:54:17,112
when, uh... when, um...

1292
01:54:17,114 --> 01:54:19,784
If you could just
give me a moment, okay?

1293
01:54:30,728 --> 01:54:32,229
Here.

1294
01:54:39,971 --> 01:54:41,773
My Sammy?

1295
01:54:49,981 --> 01:54:52,014
Magda. Oh!
