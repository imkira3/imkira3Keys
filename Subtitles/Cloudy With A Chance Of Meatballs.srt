2
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:52,349
Have you ever felt like
you were a little bit different?

3
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:55,386
Like you had something unique
to offer the world...

4
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:58,683
...if you could just get people
to see it.

5
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:04,159
Then you know exactly how it felt...

6
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,389
...to be me.

7
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:07,760
Go ahead, Flint.

8
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:14,303
What is the number one problem
facing our community today?

9
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:16,298
Untied shoelaces.

10
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:21,880
Which is why I've invented
a laceless alternative foot covering.

11
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:24,312
Spray-On Shoes.

12
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:30,122
- Voilà.
- They're so nifty.

13
00:01:30,957 --> 00:01:33,016
How you gonna get them off, nerd?

14
00:01:36,996 --> 00:01:40,898
What a freak.
He wants to be smart, but that's lame.

15
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:49,467
I wanted to run away that day.

16
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:53,506
But you can't run away
from your own feet.

17
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:06,220
Not every sardine is meant
to swim, son.

18
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:09,753
I don't understand
fishing metaphors.

19
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:12,193
- What did I say?
- Don't worry.

20
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:18,163
Honey, I think your shoes
are wonderful.

21
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:20,636
Everyone just thinks I'm a weirdo.

22
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,172
So?

23
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:25,311
People probably thought
that these guys were weirdoes too.

24
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:28,544
But that never stopped them.

25
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:33,152
I was saving this
for your birthday, but here.

26
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:36,117
A professional-grade lab coat.

27
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:38,189
Just like the real guys wear.

28
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,893
It fits perfect.

29
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:45,030
The world needs
your originality, Flint.

30
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:48,891
You just have to grow into it.

31
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:52,697
And I know that you're gonna do
big things someday.

32
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:17,786
From that moment on...

33
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:21,263
...I was determined
to invent something great.

34
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:24,267
Remote Control Television.

35
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:28,130
And, the pitch is in.

36
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:30,266
Eventually.

37
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:32,604
Hair Un-Balder.

38
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,475
Flying Car.

39
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:40,047
Monkey Thought Translator.

40
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,949
- Hungry. Hungry. Hungry.
- How wise.

41
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:46,558
No, Steve. No, no, no, no, no!
No, please! Leave it-

42
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:48,616
Ratbirds.

43
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:50,888
Hey, what's going on, little guy?

44
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,055
Flint Lockwood.

45
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:56,829
My dream was to help
my hometown...

46
00:03:57,003 --> 00:04:00,632
...a tiny island hidden under
the "A" in "Atlantic"...

47
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,736
...called Swallow Falls.

48
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:06,574
We were famous for sardines...

49
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:11,076
...until the day the Baby Brent
Sardine Cannery closed for good.

50
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:14,846
Right after everyone in the world
realized that sardines...

51
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:16,215
...are super gross.

52
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:23,687
Soon, all of us were stuck eating
the sardines that no one else wanted.

53
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:30,200
Poached, fried, boiled, dried,
candied and juiced.

54
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,735
Life became gray and flavourless.

55
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:38,104
But when all seemed lost,
I stared at defeat...

56
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:40,343
...and found hope.

57
00:05:08,587 --> 00:05:11,055
My name is Flint Lockwood.

58
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:14,491
And I was about to invent
a machine...

59
00:05:14,659 --> 00:05:16,490
...that turns water...

60
00:05:16,661 --> 00:05:18,822
...into food.

61
00:05:19,731 --> 00:05:23,724
Steve, my best friend
and trusted colleague.

62
00:05:24,135 --> 00:05:25,159
Steve.

63
00:05:25,337 --> 00:05:28,067
Can I count on your help?

64
00:05:30,475 --> 00:05:31,499
Can.

65
00:05:32,844 --> 00:05:34,436
I knew I could.

66
00:05:34,613 --> 00:05:37,173
Button, on.
Memory, activate.

67
00:05:37,349 --> 00:05:41,217
Blueprints, awesome.
Begin nano-mutation.

68
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,981
Radiation matrix, secure.

69
00:05:44,556 --> 00:05:46,148
Computer, boot.

70
00:05:47,826 --> 00:05:49,987
Coolness enhancement, complete.

71
00:05:50,161 --> 00:05:51,992
Engage coffee break.

72
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,361
Networking power grid.

73
00:06:05,377 --> 00:06:08,369
Beginning conversion of water...

74
00:06:08,546 --> 00:06:10,207
...into food.

75
00:06:10,382 --> 00:06:12,441
Hydrating protein matrix.

76
00:06:12,917 --> 00:06:15,545
Calibrating flavour panel.

77
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,553
Priming chow plopper.

78
00:06:19,157 --> 00:06:22,217
Uploading cool machine voice.

79
00:06:23,595 --> 00:06:25,153
Cheeseburger.

80
00:06:26,097 --> 00:06:30,090
Everyone is going to love this.

81
00:06:55,894 --> 00:06:57,122
Flint!

82
00:06:57,295 --> 00:06:58,762
Sorry, Dad.

83
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:01,198
Steve, keep working.

84
00:07:04,602 --> 00:07:06,934
Scanning hand.

85
00:07:24,422 --> 00:07:27,016
That's a really weird dude.

86
00:07:31,496 --> 00:07:34,158
Re-energizing tower unit.

87
00:07:39,304 --> 00:07:41,363
Jeez. See you, Dad.

88
00:07:43,074 --> 00:07:44,598
Flint.

89
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,876
Don't you think it's time to give up
this inventing thing, get a real job?

90
00:07:54,052 --> 00:07:55,542
No, why?

91
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:00,157
Well, all your technology stuff,
it just ends in disaster.

92
00:08:00,325 --> 00:08:03,192
The ratbirds, yes, they escaped
and bred at a surprising rate.

93
00:08:03,361 --> 00:08:06,023
But I took care of that problem
and disposed of them.

94
00:08:06,197 --> 00:08:08,028
Billy, just play dead.

95
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:12,431
Flint, you don't keep throwing your net
where there aren't any fish.

96
00:08:12,604 --> 00:08:14,367
- What?
- I want you to work full-time...

97
00:08:14,539 --> 00:08:17,235
...at the tackle shop.
- The tackle shop? Dad, no.

98
00:08:17,408 --> 00:08:19,000
Tackle is a good career.

99
00:08:19,177 --> 00:08:20,804
Please, I'm so close with this one.

100
00:08:20,979 --> 00:08:25,109
I just have to hook it up to the power
station and give it power and it'll work.

101
00:08:25,283 --> 00:08:27,308
And then you could sell food
in the shop...

102
00:08:27,485 --> 00:08:30,249
...and then everyone won't have to eat
sardines anymore.

103
00:08:30,421 --> 00:08:34,016
It is going to be so awesome.

104
00:08:34,726 --> 00:08:36,785
I'm sorry, son.

105
00:08:36,961 --> 00:08:38,087
No more inventing.

106
00:08:38,263 --> 00:08:41,391
Dad, I know I can do this.

107
00:08:41,566 --> 00:08:42,760
And Mom did too.

108
00:08:44,969 --> 00:08:48,564
It had been almost 10 years
since Mom died...

109
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:52,073
...and Dad still didn't understand me
like she did.

110
00:08:52,243 --> 00:08:55,701
Come on. Let's open the shop.

111
00:08:58,483 --> 00:09:01,350
Tim and Son
Sardine Bait and Tackle.

112
00:09:02,821 --> 00:09:04,618
You feeling it?

113
00:09:08,059 --> 00:09:10,960
Look out, Baby Brent!

114
00:09:12,897 --> 00:09:14,421
Baby Brent Sardines.

115
00:09:14,599 --> 00:09:17,227
Hand-packed in Swallow Falls.

116
00:09:17,402 --> 00:09:22,203
As your mayor, I know it's time to put
our sardine-canning past behind us...

117
00:09:22,373 --> 00:09:24,671
...and look to the future.

118
00:09:24,843 --> 00:09:26,902
Sardine tourism!

119
00:09:28,313 --> 00:09:30,338
That's why,
without consulting anyone...

120
00:09:30,515 --> 00:09:34,144
...I spent the entire town budget
on the thing that is under this tarp...

121
00:09:34,319 --> 00:09:36,787
...which I will be unveiling today...

122
00:09:36,955 --> 00:09:38,786
...at noon.

123
00:09:38,957 --> 00:09:43,587
Featuring a live appearance
by Baby Brent himself.

124
00:09:43,761 --> 00:09:47,060
What is up, everybody?

125
00:09:47,232 --> 00:09:49,166
- Hey.
- Hey, it's Baby Brent.

126
00:09:49,334 --> 00:09:53,395
What you doing? Stacking cans
with me on them as a baby?

127
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:58,272
Anyways, who wants to watch me
cut the ribbon...

128
00:09:58,443 --> 00:10:00,035
...at the mayor's unveiling thing?

129
00:10:00,211 --> 00:10:03,942
I'll be using these bad boys
to help save the town.

130
00:10:06,517 --> 00:10:09,350
All right, you guys.
Sardines, yeah.

131
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:13,354
- Swallow Falls forever!
- What a delight.

132
00:10:13,524 --> 00:10:17,358
Listen, you- Maybe you wanna go
to that unveiling?

133
00:10:17,528 --> 00:10:21,487
You know, Dad, why don't you
go ahead. I'll hold down the fort here.

134
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:24,567
Really? You sure you can handle it?

135
00:10:24,736 --> 00:10:27,068
Yeah, Dad,
I'm pretty sure I'll be fine.

136
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:28,799
All right, then.

137
00:10:28,973 --> 00:10:31,908
I'll be back in half an hour, skipper.

138
00:10:32,076 --> 00:10:34,271
Okay. Bye.

139
00:10:42,086 --> 00:10:44,987
This hellhole is too small
for me, Brent.

140
00:10:45,156 --> 00:10:47,056
I wanna be big.

141
00:10:47,225 --> 00:10:51,685
I want people to look at me and say,
"That is one big mayor."

142
00:10:51,863 --> 00:10:53,728
And that's why this has to work.

143
00:10:53,898 --> 00:10:55,559
It has to work.

144
00:10:55,733 --> 00:10:58,896
Otherwise, I'm just a tiny mayor
of a tiny town...

145
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:02,437
...full of tiny sardine-sucking
knuckle-scrapers.

146
00:11:02,607 --> 00:11:04,074
But not me, right?

147
00:11:04,242 --> 00:11:08,736
Oh, not you, Brent. No.
You've always been like a son to me.

148
00:11:11,349 --> 00:11:13,579
Hey, everybody.

149
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:20,551
Under this tarp is the greatest tourist
attraction ever built by humans.

150
00:11:20,725 --> 00:11:23,319
We just need 17,000 more gigajoules.

151
00:11:23,494 --> 00:11:26,395
- An attraction so...
- Go, go, go.

152
00:11:27,832 --> 00:11:29,595
What are you doing, Flint Lockwood?

153
00:11:29,767 --> 00:11:32,292
Just holding my hands
behind my back respectfully, sir.

154
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:34,404
- You know what you are, Lockwood?
- No.

155
00:11:34,572 --> 00:11:36,403
A shenaniganizer.

156
00:11:36,574 --> 00:11:37,939
A tomfool.

157
00:11:38,109 --> 00:11:40,373
- You see my beautiful angel son Cal?
- What's up?

158
00:11:40,545 --> 00:11:43,036
I love him so much.
This is my only son.

159
00:11:43,214 --> 00:11:44,841
I want him to have a bright future.

160
00:11:45,016 --> 00:11:47,280
A future in which you don't ruin
our town's day...

161
00:11:47,452 --> 00:11:49,682
...with one of your
crazy science thingies.

162
00:11:49,854 --> 00:11:53,017
- Well, that's all behind me-
- You see this contact lens, Lockwood?

163
00:11:53,191 --> 00:11:55,250
- This contact lens represent you.
- All right.

164
00:11:55,426 --> 00:11:57,656
- And my eye represents my eye.
- Okay.

165
00:11:57,829 --> 00:12:02,562
I got my eye on you.

166
00:12:02,734 --> 00:12:05,999
- Oh, my gosh, a jaywalker.
- Hey.

167
00:12:06,671 --> 00:12:10,607
And I've arranged for live coverage
from a major network...

168
00:12:10,775 --> 00:12:14,336
...and their most experienced
professional reporter.

169
00:12:15,713 --> 00:12:18,546
Oh, just send the intern.
She's cute, and she's super perky.

170
00:12:18,716 --> 00:12:22,948
Well, those are the only things we look
for in a TV weatherperson. Intern.

171
00:12:23,121 --> 00:12:26,318
How would you like to do a weather
report from a rinky-dink island...

172
00:12:26,491 --> 00:12:28,982
...in the middle of the ocean
as a favour to my cousin?

173
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,218
Really?

174
00:12:30,862 --> 00:12:32,261
Can you believe it, Manny?

175
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:35,991
Temporary
professional meteorologist.

176
00:12:36,167 --> 00:12:37,725
Okay, Manny, what about this?

177
00:12:37,902 --> 00:12:39,733
Welcome, America,
I'm Sam Sparks.

178
00:12:39,904 --> 00:12:42,270
Hello, America, Sam Sparks here.

179
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,499
America, hi. I didn't see you there.

180
00:12:44,675 --> 00:12:46,040
It's me, Sam Sparks.

181
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:50,579
On my way across the ocean.

182
00:12:51,082 --> 00:12:55,712
Now, when she gets here,
I wanna see a lot of smiling faces.

183
00:12:55,887 --> 00:12:57,548
Act like, "Hey, whoa."

184
00:12:58,256 --> 00:13:01,555
This is a great idea.

185
00:13:02,226 --> 00:13:03,750
Weather News Network.

186
00:13:03,928 --> 00:13:05,555
Weather news happens...

187
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:07,061
...or not.

188
00:13:07,231 --> 00:13:08,823
Now we're over to Swallow Falls...

189
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,332
...where our intern
is on her first day on the job.

190
00:13:11,502 --> 00:13:14,164
Or should I say, first gray on the job.

191
00:13:14,338 --> 00:13:15,930
Looks pretty cloudy there, intern.

192
00:13:16,107 --> 00:13:18,041
Hello, Sam Sparks, I'm America.

193
00:13:18,576 --> 00:13:23,479
It's Swallow Falls degrees and-
Well, let's just go to the mayor.

194
00:13:23,648 --> 00:13:27,948
Thank you and welcome,
national television audience.

195
00:13:28,119 --> 00:13:32,715
You are about to witness
an historic event, undoubtedly...

196
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:39,460
And now, here to cut
the ceremonial ribbon...

197
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:44,829
...Swallow Falls' favourite son,
Baby Brent!

198
00:13:45,002 --> 00:13:46,367
He's still got it, folks.

199
00:13:46,537 --> 00:13:47,663
Yeah.

200
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,336
I'm the best person
in the whole town.

201
00:13:58,683 --> 00:14:01,618
Food synthesis, go.

202
00:14:03,721 --> 00:14:07,623
My chest hairs are tingling.
Something's wrong.

203
00:14:08,392 --> 00:14:13,659
Well, here it is. The attraction
the whole world has been waiting for:

204
00:14:13,831 --> 00:14:15,958
Sardine Land.

205
00:14:18,202 --> 00:14:20,329
With rides and exhibits.

206
00:14:20,505 --> 00:14:24,566
And featuring Shamo,
the world's largest sardine...

207
00:14:24,742 --> 00:14:27,973
...and his flaming hoop of glory.

208
00:14:28,846 --> 00:14:31,838
Those of you in the splash zone,
look out.

209
00:14:32,016 --> 00:14:33,142
Yeah.

210
00:14:40,191 --> 00:14:42,022
Cheeseburger.

211
00:14:42,193 --> 00:14:43,251
Flint Lockwood.

212
00:14:43,427 --> 00:14:46,658
Just a second.
I'm in the middle of a-

213
00:14:55,239 --> 00:15:01,371
Well, looks like things in Swallow Falls
are sardine to get better. For-

214
00:15:01,546 --> 00:15:03,309
What just happened to me?

215
00:15:03,481 --> 00:15:04,641
Sorry.

216
00:15:26,204 --> 00:15:28,035
No.

217
00:15:28,973 --> 00:15:30,668
You're under arrest, Flint Lockwood.

218
00:15:30,841 --> 00:15:35,278
Thank goodness you only caused
minimal damage to Sardine Land.

219
00:15:41,185 --> 00:15:42,209
Come on.

220
00:15:51,762 --> 00:15:54,253
I really shouldn't be running
with these.

221
00:15:57,702 --> 00:16:00,364
Jump, jump, jump, run, run,
jump, jump, run.

222
00:16:22,059 --> 00:16:24,653
- It's a good thing no one got hurt!
- Flint Lockwood!

223
00:16:24,829 --> 00:16:29,027
I didn't get hurt, but that does
not mean that I'm not still mad at you.

224
00:17:34,298 --> 00:17:36,528
Oh, my gosh. I am so sorry.
Are you okay?

225
00:17:36,701 --> 00:17:39,693
- I didn't get a chance to-
- It's okay, it's just pain.

226
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:41,462
Sorry, I'm not myself today.

227
00:17:41,639 --> 00:17:46,576
My whole career was ruined by some
crazy jerk riding a homemade rocket.

228
00:17:47,678 --> 00:17:49,339
Wait a minute.

229
00:17:49,513 --> 00:17:51,981
What is going on with your feet?

230
00:17:52,149 --> 00:17:54,879
Spray-On Shoes.
They don't come off.

231
00:17:55,052 --> 00:17:56,417
Cool.

232
00:17:57,288 --> 00:17:59,313
This could solve
the untied shoes epidemic.

233
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:02,550
What are they made of, some kind of
elastic biopolymer adhesive?

234
00:18:02,727 --> 00:18:04,160
Yeah.

235
00:18:04,328 --> 00:18:05,352
Exactly.

236
00:18:05,529 --> 00:18:07,258
I mean...

237
00:18:07,698 --> 00:18:11,065
Wow, they're shiny. I'm Sam.

238
00:18:12,002 --> 00:18:13,230
- Flint.
- Steve.

239
00:18:13,838 --> 00:18:16,398
- Is that a Monkey Thought Translator?
- Steve.

240
00:18:17,775 --> 00:18:22,109
Incredible.
Did you make all of this stuff?

241
00:18:22,513 --> 00:18:25,243
- You hit me with a rocket.
- You kicked me in the face.

242
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:27,509
I said I was sorry.

243
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:31,686
Do you know how hard it is
to break into the weather game?

244
00:18:31,856 --> 00:18:35,553
I spent my entire life building up
to that moment.

245
00:18:36,327 --> 00:18:38,454
You get one shot at the show.

246
00:18:38,629 --> 00:18:40,722
And if you don't make it...

247
00:18:40,898 --> 00:18:44,390
...it's back to cleaning
the barometers.

248
00:18:51,475 --> 00:18:53,136
Cheese?

249
00:18:57,581 --> 00:19:01,312
But that could only mean...

250
00:19:48,432 --> 00:19:51,333
Excited. Excited.

251
00:20:01,745 --> 00:20:03,110
My machine works.

252
00:20:04,982 --> 00:20:09,146
It really works!

253
00:20:12,189 --> 00:20:13,679
Your machine?

254
00:20:13,858 --> 00:20:15,553
Is that what that rocket was?

255
00:20:17,061 --> 00:20:18,688
Do you like it?

256
00:20:19,096 --> 00:20:20,120
I love it!

257
00:20:20,598 --> 00:20:23,032
This is just amazing.
Look at this.

258
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,998
This is the greatest weather
phenomenon in history.

259
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:28,138
Hey, aren't you a weathergirl?

260
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:33,009
Manny, get your camera.

261
00:20:48,592 --> 00:20:53,029
This just in: Our humiliated weather
intern is apparently back for more.

262
00:20:53,197 --> 00:20:56,496
Thanks, Patrick. Okay, everybody,
you are not gonna believe this one...

263
00:20:56,667 --> 00:21:01,104
...but I am standing
in the middle of a burger rain.

264
00:21:01,272 --> 00:21:02,899
You may have seen
a meteor shower...

265
00:21:03,073 --> 00:21:06,873
...but you've never seen a shower
meatier than this.

266
00:21:07,044 --> 00:21:11,174
For a town stuck eating sardines,
this is totally manna from heaven.

267
00:21:11,348 --> 00:21:14,340
This tastes significantly better
than sardines.

268
00:21:21,358 --> 00:21:24,020
This is going to be big.

269
00:21:24,194 --> 00:21:26,287
This food weather
was created intentionally...

270
00:21:26,463 --> 00:21:29,660
...by meek-ish backyard tinkerer
Flint Lockwood.

271
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:31,824
Flint Lockwood?

272
00:21:32,002 --> 00:21:33,026
Hi.

273
00:21:33,203 --> 00:21:35,262
You're under arrest
for ruining Sardine Land.

274
00:21:35,439 --> 00:21:37,031
Flint, those burgers were awesome.

275
00:21:37,207 --> 00:21:40,574
The producer called and he was like,
"Everybody loves that food weather."

276
00:21:40,744 --> 00:21:41,938
- Food weather.
- What?

277
00:21:42,112 --> 00:21:43,909
This could be bigger
than Sardine Land.

278
00:21:44,081 --> 00:21:45,844
- Can you make it rain food again?
- No.

279
00:21:46,016 --> 00:21:48,211
- I don't know if I-
- You're gonna do it again?

280
00:21:48,385 --> 00:21:49,716
You gotta be kidding.

281
00:21:49,887 --> 00:21:52,082
Please, please, please.

282
00:21:54,992 --> 00:21:56,789
- Yes.
- No.

283
00:21:56,961 --> 00:21:59,657
- Give me one more chance.
- We know this was an accident.

284
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,957
- I know.
- Cheeseburgers from the sky...

285
00:22:02,132 --> 00:22:03,724
...that's not natural.

286
00:22:03,901 --> 00:22:06,563
My invention could save
the whole town.

287
00:22:06,737 --> 00:22:09,331
You will be so proud of me, Dad.

288
00:22:09,506 --> 00:22:11,303
Plus...

289
00:22:11,475 --> 00:22:12,840
...there's a girl here.

290
00:22:15,145 --> 00:22:19,104
Can you look me in the eye and
tell me you've got this under control...

291
00:22:19,283 --> 00:22:21,308
...and it's not gonna end up
in a disaster?

292
00:22:22,186 --> 00:22:23,448
Yes.

293
00:22:38,035 --> 00:22:41,129
I've got this under control,
and it's not gonna end in disaster.

294
00:22:43,407 --> 00:22:45,466
- All right.
- Thanks, Dad.

295
00:22:45,643 --> 00:22:48,874
- Oh, sure.
- Okay. So, Sam...

296
00:22:49,046 --> 00:22:53,142
...this is where the magic happens.

297
00:22:54,451 --> 00:22:57,818
Lick. Lick. Lick.

298
00:22:57,988 --> 00:23:01,219
Lick. Lick. Lick.

299
00:23:02,693 --> 00:23:04,126
Welcome, Flint.

300
00:23:06,497 --> 00:23:09,057
You seriously spend
a lot of time alone.

301
00:23:09,233 --> 00:23:10,666
What?

302
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:14,567
So here's how it works.

303
00:23:14,738 --> 00:23:18,731
Water goes in the top,
and food comes out the bottom.

304
00:23:18,909 --> 00:23:20,774
When you shot it
into the stratosphere...

305
00:23:20,944 --> 00:23:24,675
...you figured it would induce a phase
change from the cumulonimbus layer?

306
00:23:24,848 --> 00:23:27,840
That's actually
a really smart observation.

307
00:23:28,018 --> 00:23:29,713
I mean...

308
00:23:30,521 --> 00:23:32,955
The clouds probably have water
in them...

309
00:23:33,123 --> 00:23:36,524
...which, I guess, is why
you shot it up there in the first place.

310
00:23:36,694 --> 00:23:38,821
Right, right. That's why I did that.

311
00:23:38,996 --> 00:23:40,987
- On purpose.
- Right. Yeah.

312
00:23:41,165 --> 00:23:42,894
- Right.
- Of course.

313
00:23:44,435 --> 00:23:45,993
Okay.

314
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:49,264
The machine uses a principle
of hydro-genetic mutation.

315
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,432
Water molecules are bombarded
with microwave radiation...

316
00:23:52,609 --> 00:23:56,067
...which mutates their genetic recipe
into any kind of food you want.

317
00:23:56,246 --> 00:23:57,406
So...

318
00:23:57,581 --> 00:23:58,605
- Pizza?
- Yes.

319
00:23:58,782 --> 00:23:59,908
- Mashed potatoes?
- Yes.

320
00:24:00,084 --> 00:24:01,551
- Peas?
- Yes, that's also a food.

321
00:24:01,719 --> 00:24:02,947
- Steak? Apples?
- Yes.

322
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,553
- Apple sauce? BLT?
- Yes.

323
00:24:04,722 --> 00:24:06,883
- I said any kind of food.
- Chicken wings?

324
00:24:07,057 --> 00:24:09,719
Think about what you're saying,
and if it's a food, yes.

325
00:24:09,893 --> 00:24:12,191
- Baloney.
- Baloney. That is a food.

326
00:24:12,362 --> 00:24:14,626
- How about Jell-O?
- Do you like Jell-O?

327
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:16,265
I love Jell-O.

328
00:24:16,433 --> 00:24:18,833
I love Jell-O too.
Oh, and peanut butter, right?

329
00:24:19,002 --> 00:24:21,402
Oh, no, no, no,
I am severely allergic to peanuts.

330
00:24:21,572 --> 00:24:22,596
Hey, me too.

331
00:24:22,773 --> 00:24:24,365
- What's it called?
- Peanut allergy.

332
00:24:24,541 --> 00:24:25,599
- No, the machine.
- Of course.

333
00:24:26,176 --> 00:24:28,974
It's called the Flint Lockwood
Diatonic Super-Mutating...

334
00:24:29,146 --> 00:24:31,273
...Dynamic Food Replicator.

335
00:24:31,448 --> 00:24:33,109
Or, for short:

336
00:24:33,283 --> 00:24:35,046
The FLDSMDFR.

337
00:24:35,552 --> 00:24:36,644
Fliminadifiser?

338
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:38,151
FLDSMDFR.

339
00:24:38,322 --> 00:24:39,721
Fliminubahdibferer?

340
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:41,517
Fli.

341
00:24:41,692 --> 00:24:43,455
Suh.

342
00:24:43,727 --> 00:24:44,989
Fdiferf.

343
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:49,231
Manny, make sure you get this.
He's gonna make the food now.

344
00:24:49,399 --> 00:24:50,423
Now?

345
00:24:50,601 --> 00:24:54,332
Well, the thing is, I can't...

346
00:24:54,505 --> 00:24:57,565
...wait to show you
this hilarious Internet video.

347
00:24:58,675 --> 00:24:59,699
What?

348
00:24:59,877 --> 00:25:01,105
Fight the power!

349
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:03,246
What is this?

350
00:25:07,718 --> 00:25:09,015
It's so cute.

351
00:25:09,186 --> 00:25:11,017
Pushing. Folding. Connecting.

352
00:25:11,188 --> 00:25:13,986
Taping. Turning.
Painting. Switching.

353
00:25:14,158 --> 00:25:15,284
Staring.

354
00:25:15,459 --> 00:25:16,824
Motivating.

355
00:25:16,994 --> 00:25:19,519
- Placing button.
- I can't believe I've been watching this...

356
00:25:19,696 --> 00:25:21,755
...for three hours.
- I know.

357
00:25:31,008 --> 00:25:32,202
It's working.

358
00:25:32,376 --> 00:25:34,367
What do you guys want for breakfast?

359
00:25:34,545 --> 00:25:36,536
- Gummi Bears.
- Whoa, Steve, no.

360
00:25:36,713 --> 00:25:38,874
We both know how you get
around Gummi Bears.

361
00:25:39,049 --> 00:25:40,448
How about...

362
00:25:40,617 --> 00:25:42,175
...eggs.
- And toast.

363
00:25:42,352 --> 00:25:43,649
Orange juice.

364
00:25:43,821 --> 00:25:45,516
- And bacon.
- Bacon.

365
00:25:46,523 --> 00:25:47,854
What are you doing?

366
00:25:48,025 --> 00:25:49,458
Nothing.

367
00:25:49,626 --> 00:25:50,650
To the computer.

368
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:58,033
So you're sure this is safe?

369
00:25:58,569 --> 00:26:01,060
Don't worry. I have a Dangeometer
that lets us know...

370
00:26:01,238 --> 00:26:03,001
...if the food is going
to over-mutate.

371
00:26:03,173 --> 00:26:05,073
What happens
if the food over-mutates?

372
00:26:05,242 --> 00:26:07,642
I don't know.
But that'll never happen.

373
00:26:07,811 --> 00:26:10,177
All right, this probably
won't explode.

374
00:26:10,347 --> 00:26:11,371
What?

375
00:26:18,088 --> 00:26:19,749
Bacon.

376
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:28,423
Those cheeseburgers
were only the beginning...

377
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:31,363
...because a breakfast system
is on its way to Swallow Falls.

378
00:26:31,535 --> 00:26:32,729
My forecast?

379
00:26:32,903 --> 00:26:34,837
Sunny side up.

380
00:26:42,212 --> 00:26:44,680
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

381
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:56,591
Flint, my boy. Can you do lunch?

382
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,091
All right, here's the skinny:

383
00:26:58,262 --> 00:27:01,129
You keep making it rain
the snackadoos...

384
00:27:01,298 --> 00:27:03,266
...weathergirl provides
free advertising...

385
00:27:03,433 --> 00:27:05,628
...I have taken out
a very high-interest loan...

386
00:27:05,802 --> 00:27:08,862
...to convert this Podunk town
into a tourist food-topia.

387
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:12,440
All you have to do is make it rain food
three meals a day...

388
00:27:12,609 --> 00:27:14,577
...every day
for the foreseeable future...

389
00:27:14,745 --> 00:27:17,509
...and in 30 days we hold a grand
reopening of the island...

390
00:27:17,681 --> 00:27:20,479
...as a must-see cruise destination.

391
00:27:20,651 --> 00:27:23,279
And everyone, everywhere...

392
00:27:23,453 --> 00:27:27,787
...is going to love your invention.

393
00:27:28,158 --> 00:27:29,455
Do you think so?

394
00:27:29,626 --> 00:27:32,060
I know so.

395
00:27:36,433 --> 00:27:39,425
Now that's what I call
poultry in motion.

396
00:27:49,346 --> 00:27:51,906
Mr. Lockwood,
may I please have waffles?

397
00:27:52,082 --> 00:27:53,413
- Falafels?
- Jellybeans.

398
00:27:53,583 --> 00:27:54,948
- Avocado.
- Coming right up.

399
00:27:57,821 --> 00:27:59,015
Leftovers?

400
00:27:59,189 --> 00:28:02,556
Not a problem with Flint Lockwood's
latest invention, the Outtasighter...

401
00:28:02,726 --> 00:28:05,627
...so-named because it catapults
uneaten food out of sight...

402
00:28:05,796 --> 00:28:08,287
...and therefore, out of mind.

403
00:28:16,974 --> 00:28:18,669
Jellybeans!

404
00:28:18,842 --> 00:28:19,866
Awesome.

405
00:28:20,043 --> 00:28:22,341
- BLT.
- Doughnuts.

406
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:24,545
Pie.

407
00:28:24,715 --> 00:28:25,739
Gummi bears.

408
00:28:25,949 --> 00:28:28,213
- Fish.
- Crème brûlée!

409
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,554
A pizza stuffed inside a turkey...

410
00:28:32,723 --> 00:28:35,521
...the whole thing deep-fried
and dipped in chocolate.

411
00:28:36,226 --> 00:28:38,091
It's me, the mayor.

412
00:28:38,695 --> 00:28:40,060
You look different.

413
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:41,993
Did you get a new haircut?

414
00:28:42,165 --> 00:28:44,190
Yes, I did. Thank you for noticing.

415
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:54,800
- I love you. - Thanks, Dad. I love you.
- I love you. - Thanks, Dad. I love you.

416
00:28:54,978 --> 00:28:56,741
I love spending time with you, Dad.

417
00:29:01,018 --> 00:29:03,646
Hey, Dad, I'm headed back
to the lab.

418
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:07,654
If you wanna come,
I could show you how I make the food.

419
00:29:08,158 --> 00:29:09,648
No, thanks.

420
00:29:09,826 --> 00:29:14,957
That techno-food, it's too complicated
for an old fisherman.

421
00:29:15,132 --> 00:29:16,997
Got it.

422
00:29:17,934 --> 00:29:21,335
Could still use your help around here,
though, you know.

423
00:29:21,505 --> 00:29:24,167
I'm working
with the mayor now, Dad.

424
00:29:24,341 --> 00:29:27,504
I mean, the town's grand reopening
is in, like, a week.

425
00:29:27,677 --> 00:29:29,941
Right. Got it.

426
00:29:36,653 --> 00:29:38,985
Flint Lockwood?

427
00:29:39,623 --> 00:29:41,250
Yeah?

428
00:29:42,726 --> 00:29:44,990
It's my son Cal's birthday
tomorrow...

429
00:29:45,162 --> 00:29:48,563
...and I was just wondering if you
could make it rain something special.

430
00:29:48,732 --> 00:29:51,132
Well, I'm pretty backed up
on requests.

431
00:29:51,301 --> 00:29:52,962
Plus, you're always mean to me.

432
00:29:53,136 --> 00:29:54,967
It'll be just one time...

433
00:29:55,138 --> 00:29:57,606
...for my special angel's special day.

434
00:29:58,875 --> 00:30:00,240
I don't know.

435
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:03,709
You know, I don't wanna
overwork the machine, so...

436
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:07,372
Okay. I knew it was a long shot.

437
00:30:07,551 --> 00:30:10,281
I just wanted Cal to see how much
his father loves him.

438
00:30:10,454 --> 00:30:12,217
I thought you would understand.

439
00:30:15,192 --> 00:30:17,387
You know how fathers always trying
to express...

440
00:30:17,561 --> 00:30:21,224
...their love and appreciation
for their sons.

441
00:30:25,068 --> 00:30:26,126
Earl, wait.

442
00:30:37,614 --> 00:30:39,775
Touch. Touch. Touch.

443
00:30:41,918 --> 00:30:43,146
I've got an idea.

444
00:31:01,238 --> 00:31:03,138
Happy birthday, son.

445
00:31:03,306 --> 00:31:04,466
Dad?

446
00:31:04,641 --> 00:31:06,973
This is your day. Go have fun.

447
00:31:07,144 --> 00:31:10,705
- I love you guys. You're awesome.
- I love you too, son.

448
00:31:10,881 --> 00:31:14,476
- Have a good time, baby.
- Ice cream!

449
00:31:15,352 --> 00:31:18,446
Yeah! Cool.

450
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:22,785
Strawberry's my favourite.

451
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:36,062
Come on, Dad.

452
00:31:36,239 --> 00:31:37,729
I don't know, Cal.

453
00:31:37,908 --> 00:31:40,274
This doesn't look safe!

454
00:31:48,185 --> 00:31:49,311
I love you, son.

455
00:31:49,486 --> 00:31:52,649
I know, Dad. You tell me every day.

456
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,523
Flint, this is amazing.

457
00:31:58,695 --> 00:32:01,289
And designing the ice cream
to accumulate into scoops...

458
00:32:01,464 --> 00:32:03,364
...I don't know how
you're gonna top this.

459
00:32:03,533 --> 00:32:06,400
Maybe with hot fudge.

460
00:32:08,572 --> 00:32:09,664
Hey, Flint.

461
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:11,864
You wanna be in a snowball fight
with us?

462
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:15,002
Flint, what's the problem?

463
00:32:15,178 --> 00:32:17,373
I've never actually been
in a snowball fight.

464
00:32:17,547 --> 00:32:19,777
- Really?
- I don't even know the rules.

465
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:23,579
Is there like a point system or is it...

466
00:32:23,753 --> 00:32:25,618
...to the death?
- No-

467
00:32:25,789 --> 00:32:30,817
You've nev-? I mean, look, even
Steve is throwing chocolate snowballs.

468
00:32:35,532 --> 00:32:38,968
So like this?

469
00:32:39,502 --> 00:32:41,697
No, harder than that.

470
00:32:44,107 --> 00:32:46,701
Snowball.
Snowball, snowball, snowball.

471
00:32:47,711 --> 00:32:50,202
Snowball. Snowball.

472
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:53,372
Well, something to be said
for enthusiasm.

473
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:55,542
Snowball!

474
00:32:56,052 --> 00:32:57,644
Snowball!

475
00:33:00,857 --> 00:33:02,757
Snowball and snowball.

476
00:33:02,926 --> 00:33:03,984
Kids? What's going on?

477
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,253
Snowball.

478
00:33:07,497 --> 00:33:09,328
- Snowball.
- Snowball. Snowball.

479
00:33:09,499 --> 00:33:10,830
I scream, you scream...

480
00:33:11,001 --> 00:33:15,301
...we all scream for Flint Lockwood's
latest tasty town-wide treat...

481
00:33:15,472 --> 00:33:18,532
...with flurries of frozen fun
on what the mayor declared to be...

482
00:33:18,708 --> 00:33:20,141
...an ice cream snow day.

483
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:23,837
He'd also like to invite everyone
in the world to catch a cruise liner...

484
00:33:24,014 --> 00:33:25,641
...and come on down
this Saturday...

485
00:33:25,815 --> 00:33:28,306
...for the grand opening
of Chew And Swallow...

486
00:33:28,485 --> 00:33:31,648
...a town that is truly à la mode.

487
00:33:39,362 --> 00:33:42,422
A town that is truly
topped with ice cream.

488
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:45,534
With today's scoop
for the Weather News Network...

489
00:33:45,702 --> 00:33:48,068
...I'm Sam Sparks.

490
00:33:48,238 --> 00:33:51,969
Flint, this is the best breakfast ever.

491
00:33:58,515 --> 00:33:59,539
That's it!

492
00:33:59,716 --> 00:34:01,445
Researching. Role-playing.

493
00:34:01,618 --> 00:34:03,017
Dialing.

494
00:34:03,186 --> 00:34:04,813
Waiting.

495
00:34:07,057 --> 00:34:08,957
- Sam Sparks.
- Hanging up.

496
00:34:09,125 --> 00:34:11,355
Regretting. Re-psyching.

497
00:34:11,528 --> 00:34:13,393
Saying what I'm doing.

498
00:34:13,563 --> 00:34:15,588
- Flint?
- "Hi, Sam, how are you? That's nice.

499
00:34:15,765 --> 00:34:18,029
I was wondering if you would like
to go on a da-"

500
00:34:18,201 --> 00:34:19,532
Activity with me tomorrow.

501
00:34:21,604 --> 00:34:24,038
- Okay.
- Great, bye. Meet me in the forest.

502
00:34:24,207 --> 00:34:26,641
Nailed it. Gotta go, Steve.

503
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:29,870
Keep an eye on the lab for me.

504
00:34:31,414 --> 00:34:33,780
Steve.

505
00:34:34,217 --> 00:34:35,912
Foster still at the plate.

506
00:34:36,086 --> 00:34:38,020
And nobody out.

507
00:34:38,188 --> 00:34:39,655
Where are we going?

508
00:34:39,823 --> 00:34:42,053
Oh, nowhere.
I just thought it'd be nice...

509
00:34:42,225 --> 00:34:46,286
...for the two of us
to go on a walk together.

510
00:34:46,463 --> 00:34:49,489
Like you do as friends.

511
00:34:49,933 --> 00:34:52,993
Oh, my, what's that?

512
00:35:02,078 --> 00:35:03,739
Jell-O's my favourite.

513
00:35:04,414 --> 00:35:06,712
You never made a request, so...

514
00:35:06,883 --> 00:35:08,714
...I made one for you.

515
00:35:11,554 --> 00:35:13,385
Flint?

516
00:35:13,556 --> 00:35:14,921
Flint?

517
00:35:15,325 --> 00:35:16,952
Join me.

518
00:35:30,673 --> 00:35:31,799
But how did you-?

519
00:35:31,975 --> 00:35:35,172
I made it rain Jell-O, then I gathered
it up with the Outtasighter...

520
00:35:35,345 --> 00:35:37,472
...and then I brought it here
and pressed it...

521
00:35:37,647 --> 00:35:41,208
...into a gigantic custom-carved plastic
Tupperware mold I made. No big deal.

522
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:45,417
Everything's made of Jell-O.

523
00:35:45,588 --> 00:35:47,078
This piano, those sconces...

524
00:35:47,257 --> 00:35:49,725
...that ghetto blaster, that Jell-O,
that aquarium...

525
00:35:49,893 --> 00:35:51,986
...that Venus de Milo
with your face on it...

526
00:35:52,162 --> 00:35:55,097
...next to a Michelangelo's David
that also has your face.

527
00:35:55,899 --> 00:35:59,096
Come on, Sam,
what are you waiting for?

528
00:36:01,271 --> 00:36:02,568
Nothing!

529
00:36:05,308 --> 00:36:06,332
Yeah.

530
00:36:19,355 --> 00:36:21,084
Cannonball.

531
00:36:22,492 --> 00:36:23,959
Belly flop.

532
00:36:27,597 --> 00:36:29,588
Why did I do that?

533
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:40,074
- So Jell-O.
- Right. Right, right.

534
00:36:40,243 --> 00:36:41,710
It's a solid, it's a liquid...

535
00:36:41,878 --> 00:36:46,372
...it's a visco-elastic polymer made of
polypeptide chains, but you eat it.

536
00:36:46,549 --> 00:36:48,210
I mean...

537
00:36:48,384 --> 00:36:50,443
...it tastes good.

538
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:52,554
- Why do you do that?
- Do what?

539
00:36:52,722 --> 00:36:56,852
Say something super smart
and then bail from it.

540
00:36:58,595 --> 00:36:59,653
Can you keep a secret?

541
00:36:59,829 --> 00:37:01,592
No.

542
00:37:02,565 --> 00:37:05,056
But this time, sure, yeah.

543
00:37:06,202 --> 00:37:12,163
Okay. Well, it was a really
long time ago, but I, too, was...

544
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:15,068
...a nerd.

545
00:37:15,678 --> 00:37:16,702
Too?

546
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,246
When I was a little girl...

547
00:37:19,415 --> 00:37:22,009
...I wore a ponytail, I had glasses...

548
00:37:22,185 --> 00:37:25,882
...and I was totally obsessed
with the science of weather.

549
00:37:28,291 --> 00:37:30,282
Other girls wanted a Barbie.

550
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:34,328
I wanted a Doppler Weather
Radar 2000 Turbo.

551
00:37:34,497 --> 00:37:37,466
But all the kids used to taunt me
with this lame song.

552
00:37:37,634 --> 00:37:38,658
It wasn't even clever.

553
00:37:38,835 --> 00:37:40,769
Four-eyes, four-eyes

554
00:37:40,937 --> 00:37:42,996
You need glasses to see

555
00:37:45,909 --> 00:37:47,399
Go on.

556
00:37:48,244 --> 00:37:49,609
So I got a new look...

557
00:37:49,779 --> 00:37:52,270
...gave up the science-y
smart stuff...

558
00:37:52,448 --> 00:37:54,575
...and I was never
made fun of again.

559
00:37:54,751 --> 00:37:58,778
And I still need these glasses,
but I never wear them.

560
00:37:58,955 --> 00:38:01,446
- I'll bet you look great with glasses on.
- I'm not-

561
00:38:01,624 --> 00:38:03,114
And on they go.

562
00:38:07,096 --> 00:38:08,120
- What?
- Nothing.

563
00:38:08,298 --> 00:38:09,788
Wait.

564
00:38:13,836 --> 00:38:16,134
It's a Jell-O scrunchie.

565
00:38:19,175 --> 00:38:22,008
And now, the reveal.

566
00:38:25,515 --> 00:38:26,539
Wow.

567
00:38:27,784 --> 00:38:30,412
I mean, you were okay before...

568
00:38:30,587 --> 00:38:32,487
...but now...

569
00:38:32,956 --> 00:38:35,117
...you're beautiful.

570
00:38:35,291 --> 00:38:37,987
No, I'm not. I can't go out in public
like this.

571
00:38:38,161 --> 00:38:40,994
Well, why not?

572
00:38:41,164 --> 00:38:44,224
I mean, this is the real you, right?

573
00:38:45,702 --> 00:38:47,260
Smart.

574
00:38:47,437 --> 00:38:49,405
Bespectacled.

575
00:38:50,006 --> 00:38:51,974
Who wouldn't wanna see that?

576
00:38:52,141 --> 00:38:56,737
You know, I've never met anyone
like you, Flint Lockwood.

577
00:38:56,913 --> 00:38:58,676
Me either.

578
00:38:58,848 --> 00:39:00,975
But about you.

579
00:39:17,967 --> 00:39:19,696
Flint, you have a call

580
00:39:19,869 --> 00:39:21,769
Flint, you have a call

581
00:39:21,938 --> 00:39:23,701
Is your phone ringing?

582
00:39:23,873 --> 00:39:26,899
That's weird.
Someone must've changed my ring.

583
00:39:27,076 --> 00:39:29,203
Oh, it's the mayor.
Do you mind if I take this?

584
00:39:29,379 --> 00:39:30,403
No, no, no.

585
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:33,344
- Go ahead, take it. That's fine.
- I'm sorry. It's important.

586
00:39:33,516 --> 00:39:36,917
- I should be going too. It's getting late.
- I'm just gonna step outside.

587
00:39:47,296 --> 00:39:49,423
Dad, you came.
I have so much to tell you.

588
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:52,625
- Do I look all right?
- You look great. Come on, let's go.

589
00:39:54,003 --> 00:39:55,300
Dad, I almost kissed a girl.

590
00:39:55,471 --> 00:39:58,167
- It's Baby Brent, you know?
- It was the coolest thing- Hi.

591
00:39:59,008 --> 00:40:01,841
- I should be on the list.
- Hey, Brian.

592
00:40:02,011 --> 00:40:07,142
What? You're letting that guy in?
That guy's a nerd.

593
00:40:09,218 --> 00:40:11,049
Hey, how's it going?

594
00:40:11,688 --> 00:40:14,122
Oh, thank you. Thank you so much.
Thank you.

595
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:17,589
A toast.
To Flint and his delicious steaks.

596
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,695
- Oh, thanks. Thank you.
- Very nice place.

597
00:40:20,863 --> 00:40:22,763
Oh, wow. Thank you.

598
00:40:22,932 --> 00:40:25,833
- Flint Lockwood.
- Earl.

599
00:40:31,274 --> 00:40:32,605
So no roof.

600
00:40:32,775 --> 00:40:35,073
Yep. You just hold out your plate.

601
00:40:35,244 --> 00:40:37,235
And I even made it rain
your favourite:

602
00:40:37,413 --> 00:40:38,437
Meat.

603
00:40:45,855 --> 00:40:46,879
Okay.

604
00:40:47,557 --> 00:40:51,015
So you know how the grand reopening
of the town is tomorrow?

605
00:40:51,194 --> 00:40:56,427
Well, the mayor has asked me
to cut the ribbon.

606
00:40:56,599 --> 00:40:58,965
He said my invention
saved the town.

607
00:40:59,402 --> 00:41:01,734
Aren't you proud of me?

608
00:41:09,712 --> 00:41:11,339
Well...

609
00:41:12,115 --> 00:41:14,413
...doesn't this steak look
a little big to you?

610
00:41:16,519 --> 00:41:21,752
Yeah, it's a big steak. I mean, every
steak is not exactly the same size.

611
00:41:21,924 --> 00:41:24,415
Did you even hear what I just said?

612
00:41:25,795 --> 00:41:27,626
Son, look around.

613
00:41:27,797 --> 00:41:30,322
I'm not sure this is good for people.

614
00:41:31,901 --> 00:41:34,301
Maybe you should think about
turning this thing off.

615
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:37,234
It's making everybody happy.

616
00:41:37,473 --> 00:41:39,338
Everybody except you.

617
00:41:40,009 --> 00:41:42,273
When are you gonna accept
that this is who I am...

618
00:41:42,445 --> 00:41:46,541
...instead of trying to get me to work
in some boring tackle shop?

619
00:41:48,151 --> 00:41:49,743
Well...

620
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:52,787
...you seem like you know
what you're doing, then.

621
00:41:54,757 --> 00:41:57,351
I guess I'll just get out of your way.

622
00:42:25,421 --> 00:42:26,649
Get with the times, man.

623
00:42:26,823 --> 00:42:29,485
I mean, there's no pleasing
that guy.

624
00:42:29,659 --> 00:42:33,755
He just wants to take anything good
I do and just smoosh it.

625
00:42:43,539 --> 00:42:45,973
These are big hot dogs.

626
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:57,843
Man.

627
00:42:58,454 --> 00:43:00,888
I mean, this isn't that bad.

628
00:43:01,057 --> 00:43:02,854
- Is it, Steve?
- Yellow.

629
00:43:03,025 --> 00:43:04,151
You're right, Steve.

630
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:07,126
The Dangeometer is in the yellow.

631
00:43:07,296 --> 00:43:08,661
I don't know what to do.

632
00:43:08,831 --> 00:43:10,423
I do...

633
00:43:11,167 --> 00:43:13,727
...declare these hot dogs
to be delicious!

634
00:43:14,837 --> 00:43:16,498
Oh, no.

635
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,771
How did you get in here?

636
00:43:18,941 --> 00:43:20,772
Tomorrow's the big day, Flint.

637
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:24,711
The entire town's fate is resting
on your food weather.

638
00:43:24,881 --> 00:43:26,007
I'm thinking pasta.

639
00:43:26,449 --> 00:43:30,909
Some light apps.
I know you won't let us down.

640
00:43:33,022 --> 00:43:35,923
Well, Mr. Mayor, I think there's
something you should see.

641
00:43:36,092 --> 00:43:37,354
What?

642
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,696
This is the molecular structure
of a hot dog that fell last week.

643
00:43:42,265 --> 00:43:46,725
And this is the molecular structure
of a hot dog that fell today.

644
00:43:47,136 --> 00:43:48,899
The machine uses
microwave radiation...

645
00:43:49,071 --> 00:43:51,301
...to mutate the genetic recipe
of the food.

646
00:43:51,474 --> 00:43:54,136
The more we ask it to make,
the more clouds it takes in...

647
00:43:54,310 --> 00:43:58,303
...the more radiation it emits, the more
these molecules could over-mutate.

648
00:43:59,315 --> 00:44:01,715
I think that's why the food
is getting bigger.

649
00:44:02,752 --> 00:44:04,549
Here's what I heard:

650
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,915
"Science, science, science, bigger."

651
00:44:07,089 --> 00:44:08,750
And bigger is better.

652
00:44:08,925 --> 00:44:12,520
Everyone's gonna love
these new portion sizes.

653
00:44:13,562 --> 00:44:14,927
I know I do.

654
00:44:17,767 --> 00:44:19,598
My dad thinks I should turn it off.

655
00:44:19,769 --> 00:44:24,001
Geniuses like us are never understood
by their fathers, Flint.

656
00:44:24,173 --> 00:44:25,265
But what if things go-

657
00:44:25,441 --> 00:44:27,671
Who needs the approval
of one family member...

658
00:44:27,843 --> 00:44:30,710
...when you can have it
from millions of acquaintances?

659
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:34,407
Not to mention that little cutlet,
Sam Sparks.

660
00:44:34,583 --> 00:44:36,141
And me.

661
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:40,380
I've always felt that you were
like a son to me, Flint.

662
00:44:40,556 --> 00:44:45,516
And I'm gonna be so proud of you
tomorrow when you cut that ribbon...

663
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:47,185
...save the town...

664
00:44:47,363 --> 00:44:51,959
...and prove to everybody
what a great inventor you are.

665
00:44:52,134 --> 00:44:54,659
So here's the cheese:

666
00:44:54,837 --> 00:44:56,805
You can keep it going...

667
00:44:56,973 --> 00:44:58,941
...get everything
you've ever wanted...

668
00:44:59,108 --> 00:45:02,407
...and be the great man
I know you can be.

669
00:45:02,578 --> 00:45:05,342
Or you can turn it off...

670
00:45:05,514 --> 00:45:07,277
...ruin everything...

671
00:45:07,450 --> 00:45:11,113
...and no one will ever like you.

672
00:45:11,787 --> 00:45:13,618
It's your choice.

673
00:45:13,789 --> 00:45:15,086
Choice.

674
00:45:15,257 --> 00:45:16,690
Choice.

675
00:45:16,859 --> 00:45:17,883
Choice.

676
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:19,357
Choice.

677
00:45:19,528 --> 00:45:21,428
Choice.

678
00:45:24,166 --> 00:45:25,190
Okay.

679
00:45:36,379 --> 00:45:39,075
I mean, bigger is better...

680
00:45:39,248 --> 00:45:40,272
...right?

681
00:45:40,449 --> 00:45:42,542
Oh, yeah.

682
00:45:46,455 --> 00:45:50,255
Spaghetti. Asparagus. Celery.
Garlic bread. Meatball. Shrimp.

683
00:46:03,672 --> 00:46:05,970
- Looks safe to me.
- And sanitary too.

684
00:46:39,708 --> 00:46:42,871
Who's hungry?

685
00:46:43,045 --> 00:46:47,607
Welcome, tourists,
to Chew And Swallow.

686
00:46:47,783 --> 00:46:49,307
That is one big mayor.

687
00:46:49,485 --> 00:46:52,943
Delight in our nacho-cheese
hot springs.

688
00:46:54,156 --> 00:46:57,182
Allow your kids to eat
all the junk food they want...

689
00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:00,089
...in our completely
unsupervised Kid Zone!

690
00:47:00,262 --> 00:47:02,287
I've got jellybeans for teeth.

691
00:47:02,465 --> 00:47:04,330
And when the fun is done...

692
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:08,436
...gaze upon the sunset
cresting over Mount Leftovers.

693
00:47:08,604 --> 00:47:12,404
From which we're protected
by a presumably indestructible dam.

694
00:47:12,842 --> 00:47:16,642
We've got people here today
from all around the world...

695
00:47:16,812 --> 00:47:19,042
...from as far as China
to West Virginia.

696
00:47:19,215 --> 00:47:21,080
Also I think there's
some Canadians here.

697
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:23,514
- You need to look at this.
- Why aren't you on TV?

698
00:47:23,686 --> 00:47:25,551
You're supposed
to be broadcasting this.

699
00:47:25,721 --> 00:47:28,053
There's a problem.
The food's getting bigger.

700
00:47:28,224 --> 00:47:31,193
I know, it's great. Bigger portion sizes.
Everyone loves it.

701
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:33,692
I'm not sure we're doing
the right thing here.

702
00:47:33,863 --> 00:47:36,263
What if we've bitten off more
than we can chew?

703
00:47:36,432 --> 00:47:40,368
For the first time in my life, everybody
loves something that I've done.

704
00:47:40,536 --> 00:47:42,731
Why can't you just be
happy for me...

705
00:47:42,905 --> 00:47:45,430
...and go say the weather
or something. Jeez.

706
00:47:45,608 --> 00:47:46,973
And without further ado...

707
00:47:47,143 --> 00:47:51,079
...our town's hero
and my metaphorical son...

708
00:47:51,247 --> 00:47:53,647
...Flint Lockwood.

709
00:47:53,816 --> 00:47:55,147
Yeah, Flint.

710
00:47:55,317 --> 00:47:57,342
Thank you. Thank you, everyone.

711
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,147
- Sign my shrimp.
- Thank you.

712
00:47:59,321 --> 00:48:01,221
- Yeah. Yeah.
- I love you.

713
00:48:01,724 --> 00:48:03,885
I admire your quirkiness, dude.

714
00:48:04,059 --> 00:48:07,688
Brent, we're gonna need you
to hand over the ceremonial scissors.

715
00:48:08,297 --> 00:48:09,764
But-

716
00:48:09,999 --> 00:48:11,023
No.

717
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:14,328
- You can't. You can't take them. No.
- Here you go.

718
00:48:15,070 --> 00:48:17,402
I'm Baby Brent.

719
00:48:19,475 --> 00:48:22,273
Put your clothes back on.

720
00:48:22,878 --> 00:48:25,244
Who am I?

721
00:48:27,016 --> 00:48:29,143
Go ahead, Flint.

722
00:48:29,318 --> 00:48:31,718
Everybody loves you.

723
00:48:31,887 --> 00:48:34,583
Lockwood! Lockwood! Lockwood!

724
00:48:34,757 --> 00:48:37,692
Lockwood! Lockwood! Lockwood!

725
00:49:10,793 --> 00:49:13,853
Danger. Danger. Danger.

726
00:49:17,533 --> 00:49:20,229
Salt-and-pepper wind?

727
00:49:22,004 --> 00:49:23,562
Oregano.

728
00:49:40,155 --> 00:49:43,215
Sam, wait. No, I can turn it off.

729
00:49:48,564 --> 00:49:50,156
I can turn it off.

730
00:50:03,245 --> 00:50:05,770
All right, kid, it's all gonna be okay.

731
00:50:08,484 --> 00:50:10,475
Oh, no.

732
00:50:12,821 --> 00:50:15,449
- Pardon me.
- Pardon me.

733
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:18,716
- Excuse me.
- No problem.

734
00:50:22,398 --> 00:50:24,025
No.

735
00:50:31,473 --> 00:50:33,805
- Gummi Bears.
- Not now, Steve.

736
00:50:40,282 --> 00:50:43,251
Condiments? Salt? Pepper?

737
00:50:45,654 --> 00:50:47,349
Flint.

738
00:50:51,393 --> 00:50:53,725
This is Sam Sparks,
live from Chew And Swallow...

739
00:50:53,896 --> 00:50:55,363
...where a spaghetti twister-

740
00:50:55,531 --> 00:50:59,729
Sam, hey, we love a good storm
over here, but you look like a nerd.

741
00:50:59,902 --> 00:51:04,134
Patrick, several children are stranded
in the path of this tomato tornado.

742
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:05,964
My tummy hurts.

743
00:51:07,843 --> 00:51:09,140
Cal.

744
00:51:10,412 --> 00:51:13,472
What is that, a scrunchie? I haven't
seen one of those since 1995.

745
00:51:13,649 --> 00:51:17,278
What? We have
an actual weather emergency.

746
00:51:17,453 --> 00:51:19,421
Well, we'll get right back
to that storm...

747
00:51:19,588 --> 00:51:22,352
...and hopefully Sam'll look
a little more appealing.

748
00:51:30,032 --> 00:51:33,593
Steve, we just have to upload the kill
code and then we'll shut down the-

749
00:51:33,769 --> 00:51:34,997
What are you doing here?

750
00:51:35,170 --> 00:51:37,434
I've been ordering dinner
for the last 10 minutes.

751
00:51:37,606 --> 00:51:40,040
- Is something going on?
- I've gotta stop the machine.

752
00:51:40,209 --> 00:51:42,404
Everyone's in danger
because of me.

753
00:51:42,578 --> 00:51:45,445
Oh, it can't be that bad.

754
00:51:45,781 --> 00:51:48,443
- No.
- Well, I'm out of here.

755
00:51:48,617 --> 00:51:51,085
I can still stop the order
with the kill code.

756
00:51:54,089 --> 00:51:56,785
- Sending kill code.
- I'm back.

757
00:51:56,959 --> 00:51:59,018
Got to get the button.

758
00:52:00,629 --> 00:52:01,721
Play. Fun. Fun. Play.

759
00:52:01,897 --> 00:52:06,527
Hey, Flint. It's been nice
to beet you.

760
00:52:07,336 --> 00:52:09,861
That's a radish.

761
00:52:31,493 --> 00:52:35,862
That was the only way
to communicate with the machine.

762
00:52:36,265 --> 00:52:37,994
What exactly did you order?

763
00:52:38,167 --> 00:52:42,160
A Vegas-style all-you-can-eat buffet.

764
00:52:44,239 --> 00:52:47,731
Jellybean. Watermelon.
Marshmallow. Pretzel. Sushi.

765
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:53,974
Cheeseburger. Pretzel. Egg salad.
Strawberry. Marshmallow.

766
00:52:55,918 --> 00:52:57,112
Strawberry.

767
00:53:02,090 --> 00:53:04,581
- Is everyone okay?
- Yeah.

768
00:53:11,266 --> 00:53:13,427
Help, somebody.

769
00:53:13,735 --> 00:53:15,669
Help me, please.

770
00:53:15,838 --> 00:53:17,601
It's my son.

771
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:19,605
We need a doctor.

772
00:53:19,775 --> 00:53:22,608
Is anyone here a doctor? Anyone?

773
00:53:22,778 --> 00:53:24,678
I am a doctor.

774
00:53:24,847 --> 00:53:25,871
You are?

775
00:53:26,048 --> 00:53:28,710
I was, back in Guatemala.

776
00:53:28,884 --> 00:53:30,818
I came here for a better life.

777
00:53:30,986 --> 00:53:32,180
Pretty great decision, eh?

778
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:38,690
How is he, doc?

779
00:53:40,762 --> 00:53:42,059
He's in a food coma.

780
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:45,123
Too much junk food.

781
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:46,631
I need a celery, stat.

782
00:53:46,802 --> 00:53:48,531
Here you go.

783
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:55,273
- Daddy?
- Oh, Cal. Cal.

784
00:53:55,444 --> 00:53:57,912
I love you, son.

785
00:54:01,483 --> 00:54:03,542
Looks like everything
turned out okay.

786
00:54:03,719 --> 00:54:04,845
Not yet, it hasn't.

787
00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:08,387
That twister was an amuse-bouche
compared to what's on the way.

788
00:54:08,557 --> 00:54:11,082
- What's an amuse-bouche?
- Manny, patch us through.

789
00:54:17,332 --> 00:54:18,492
Go.

790
00:54:18,667 --> 00:54:21,534
Cute report, Nancy.
Hey. Hey. Four-eyes.

791
00:54:21,703 --> 00:54:22,829
Can it, Patrick.

792
00:54:23,005 --> 00:54:26,338
We are about to be in the epicentre
of a perfect food storm.

793
00:54:26,508 --> 00:54:28,669
It's going to spread
across the globe.

794
00:54:29,144 --> 00:54:32,511
I've calculated the Coriolis
acceleration of the storm system.

795
00:54:32,681 --> 00:54:34,740
First, it'll hit New York...

796
00:54:34,917 --> 00:54:36,942
...then Paris...

797
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:40,020
...then the Jiayuguan Pass
in eastern China.

798
00:54:40,188 --> 00:54:45,990
And in four hours the entire northern
hemisphere will be one big potluck.

799
00:55:11,219 --> 00:55:12,686
Flint?

800
00:55:20,896 --> 00:55:22,227
Flint?

801
00:55:22,397 --> 00:55:23,455
Hey, Dad.

802
00:55:24,166 --> 00:55:25,758
What are you doing?

803
00:55:25,934 --> 00:55:28,596
Well, I tried to help everybody...

804
00:55:28,770 --> 00:55:32,729
...but instead I ruined everything.

805
00:55:33,308 --> 00:55:35,333
I'm just a piece of junk.

806
00:55:35,510 --> 00:55:39,446
So I threw myself away.

807
00:55:39,881 --> 00:55:43,282
Along with all these
dumb inventions.

808
00:55:43,452 --> 00:55:45,317
This is junk.

809
00:55:46,054 --> 00:55:48,147
This is junk.

810
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:52,151
This is junk.

811
00:55:53,028 --> 00:55:56,862
Oh, son. Listen, when your boat is,
when it's listing...

812
00:55:57,032 --> 00:55:59,500
...and if it's not running,
you know-

813
00:55:59,668 --> 00:56:01,898
Don't worry, Dad, I get it.

814
00:56:02,070 --> 00:56:04,538
Mom was wrong about me.

815
00:56:05,607 --> 00:56:07,598
I'm not an inventor.

816
00:56:08,744 --> 00:56:11,178
I should've just quit when you said.

817
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:20,253
Well...

818
00:56:21,156 --> 00:56:24,887
...when it rains, you put on a coat.

819
00:56:25,293 --> 00:56:29,923
Dad, you know I don't understand
fishing metaphors-

820
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,024
What?

821
00:56:37,139 --> 00:56:38,197
My coat.

822
00:56:48,717 --> 00:56:53,017
Come on, Steve.
We've got diem to carpe.

823
00:56:59,761 --> 00:57:01,023
Kill code downloading.

824
00:57:03,532 --> 00:57:05,898
Redesigning. Virtualizing.

825
00:57:06,068 --> 00:57:07,660
Cutting.

826
00:57:08,336 --> 00:57:10,827
Welding. Forging.

827
00:57:11,006 --> 00:57:12,906
- Wiring.
- Helping.

828
00:57:13,075 --> 00:57:14,702
Testing.

829
00:57:15,911 --> 00:57:17,845
Yes.

830
00:57:21,283 --> 00:57:23,513
Flying Car 2.

831
00:57:23,685 --> 00:57:26,381
Now with wings.

832
00:57:36,932 --> 00:57:39,958
Hey, I had a weird dream
like this once.

833
00:57:40,402 --> 00:57:42,962
I have a macaroni
on my head.

834
00:57:44,306 --> 00:57:45,830
Run.

835
00:57:51,179 --> 00:57:52,305
No school!

836
00:57:57,385 --> 00:58:01,549
Still nothing, nothing in the bottom of
the third inning.

837
00:58:09,464 --> 00:58:10,658
Everyone.

838
00:58:12,734 --> 00:58:14,759
I want to apologize.

839
00:58:16,238 --> 00:58:18,263
Especially to you, Sam.

840
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:20,567
But I have a plan.

841
00:58:20,742 --> 00:58:23,176
This flash drive contains a kill code.

842
00:58:23,345 --> 00:58:26,678
I will fly up into that food storm,
plug it into the machine...

843
00:58:26,848 --> 00:58:28,782
...and shut it down forever...

844
00:58:28,950 --> 00:58:31,316
...while you guys evacuate
the island, using bread

845
00:58:31,486 --> 00:58:33,283
This is all his fault. Get him.

846
00:58:33,455 --> 00:58:34,479
There he is! Get him!

847
00:58:34,656 --> 00:58:35,680
Get Flint.

848
00:58:35,857 --> 00:58:38,951
Let's rock his car back and forth.

849
00:58:43,832 --> 00:58:45,800
Hey!

850
00:58:46,334 --> 00:58:49,235
This mess we're in
is all our faults.

851
00:58:50,705 --> 00:58:53,572
Me, I didn't even protect
my own son.

852
00:58:53,742 --> 00:58:56,210
Look, I'm as mad at Flint as you are.

853
00:58:56,378 --> 00:59:00,712
In fact, when he gets out of that car,
I'm gonna slap him in the face.

854
00:59:00,882 --> 00:59:04,978
I know Flint Lockwood made the food,
but it was made-to-order.

855
00:59:05,153 --> 00:59:08,020
And now it's time for all of us
to pay the bill.

856
00:59:18,633 --> 00:59:20,464
Thank you, Earl.

857
00:59:21,670 --> 00:59:23,331
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

858
00:59:23,505 --> 00:59:27,498
- Let's go build some boats.
- Yeah.

859
00:59:28,043 --> 00:59:29,840
I'm gonna go build a boat.

860
00:59:31,446 --> 00:59:32,470
I'm coming with you.

861
00:59:33,415 --> 00:59:36,748
You're gonna need someone
to navigate you through that storm.

862
00:59:37,719 --> 00:59:39,152
I can't let you do this alone.

863
00:59:39,321 --> 00:59:42,051
- Oh, Sam, I'm so sorry.
- Are you kidding?

864
00:59:42,224 --> 00:59:44,055
- Well, I just thought that we-
- No.

865
00:59:44,226 --> 00:59:45,250
Okay.

866
00:59:45,427 --> 00:59:48,191
- You are going to need a co-pilot.
- You're a pilot too?

867
00:59:48,630 --> 00:59:51,064
Yes. I am also a particle physicist.

868
00:59:51,233 --> 00:59:53,292
- Really?
- No, that was a joke.

869
00:59:53,468 --> 00:59:54,492
I am also a comedian.

870
00:59:57,005 --> 00:59:59,872
- Let's do this thing.
- I'm coming too.

871
01:00:00,041 --> 01:00:02,134
Brent, that's okay.

872
01:00:02,310 --> 01:00:05,404
No, it's not okay.

873
01:00:05,580 --> 01:00:09,209
I've been coasting on my fame
since I was a baby.

874
01:00:09,384 --> 01:00:12,285
But it was all just an illusion.

875
01:00:12,454 --> 01:00:16,550
Maybe up there
I'll find out who I really am.

876
01:00:17,292 --> 01:00:19,920
The car's pretty full, so...

877
01:00:21,062 --> 01:00:22,495
Yeah.

878
01:00:22,664 --> 01:00:23,790
Brent.

879
01:00:23,965 --> 01:00:25,694
Okay.

880
01:00:38,246 --> 01:00:40,077
Good luck, son.

881
01:00:47,522 --> 01:00:49,922
Steve.

882
01:00:51,293 --> 01:00:52,624
Pea-soup fog.

883
01:00:52,794 --> 01:00:55,354
Manny, hit the wipers.

884
01:00:58,199 --> 01:01:01,635
There's massive gastro-precipitation
accumulated around the machine.

885
01:01:03,004 --> 01:01:04,869
It's almost as if it's...

886
01:01:05,206 --> 01:01:08,505
Inside a giant meatball.

887
01:01:12,614 --> 01:01:14,741
Water goes in the top...

888
01:01:14,916 --> 01:01:18,818
...a food hurricane
comes out the bottom.

889
01:01:19,254 --> 01:01:21,119
Glad I'm wearing a diaper.

890
01:01:37,839 --> 01:01:40,034
Anybody order pizza?

891
01:01:40,475 --> 01:01:42,500
Hold on.

892
01:01:42,677 --> 01:01:44,611
The pizza's chasing us?

893
01:01:44,779 --> 01:01:46,679
Sentient food? That's impossible.

894
01:01:46,848 --> 01:01:49,783
Unless its molecular structure's
mutated into super food!

895
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:53,352
That's been genetically engineered
to protect the FLDSMDFR.

896
01:01:53,521 --> 01:01:55,216
Pizza.

897
01:01:55,390 --> 01:01:57,620
Pizza. Pizza. Pizza.

898
01:02:00,695 --> 01:02:05,029
That was close. I mean, can you
imagine if we lost this kill code?

899
01:02:11,639 --> 01:02:12,901
- Tim's Tackle Shop.
- Dad.

900
01:02:13,074 --> 01:02:14,735
You're okay, great.

901
01:02:14,909 --> 01:02:17,434
I need a favour. The fate of the world
depends on it!

902
01:02:17,612 --> 01:02:19,671
Okay, then, skipper.
What do you need?

903
01:02:19,848 --> 01:02:24,080
Go into my lab, get on my computer
and e-mail a file to my cell phone.

904
01:02:31,659 --> 01:02:32,683
All right.

905
01:02:38,066 --> 01:02:40,057
- Want me to drive?
- Yeah, okay.

906
01:02:52,981 --> 01:02:54,949
You're a lot better than me.

907
01:03:01,089 --> 01:03:02,215
Okay, here's the plan:

908
01:03:02,390 --> 01:03:05,188
Sam and I will enter the meteoroid
through the intake here...

909
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:07,692
...which should lead us straight
to the FLDSMDFR.

910
01:03:07,862 --> 01:03:10,592
Manny, you and Steve stay on the
plane. Don't spray that.

911
01:03:10,765 --> 01:03:13,825
Once my dad e-mails me the kill code,
we'll destroy the machine...

912
01:03:14,002 --> 01:03:16,300
...and rendezvous
at the western blowhole in-

913
01:03:16,471 --> 01:03:18,996
- How long until the world's destroyed?
- Twenty minutes.

914
01:03:19,174 --> 01:03:20,198
Just before then.

915
01:03:20,375 --> 01:03:23,208
What about me, Brent?
What do I do?

916
01:03:23,778 --> 01:03:27,578
You can be president
of the back seat.

917
01:03:29,384 --> 01:03:30,442
Deploy hatch.

918
01:03:30,618 --> 01:03:33,815
Car upside down, go.

919
01:03:35,256 --> 01:03:37,087
Ladies first?

920
01:03:37,559 --> 01:03:39,049
No?

921
01:03:39,227 --> 01:03:40,660
All right.

922
01:03:41,763 --> 01:03:43,890
Wait for me.

923
01:03:44,065 --> 01:03:46,090
Great. Okay, I'm good.

924
01:03:48,436 --> 01:03:52,338
As long as we stay on course,
it should be a straight shot to the-

925
01:03:54,542 --> 01:03:56,271
Yeah!

926
01:03:59,647 --> 01:04:01,672
We're a team.

927
01:04:14,329 --> 01:04:16,797
We've landed here
in some kind of exhaust vent.

928
01:04:16,965 --> 01:04:20,867
If we go this way, the Flamidabager
should be right down this air shaft.

929
01:04:21,035 --> 01:04:22,764
Brent, get out of that pie.

930
01:04:22,937 --> 01:04:24,165
What's that?

931
01:04:37,352 --> 01:04:39,115
Oh, boy.

932
01:04:46,161 --> 01:04:48,493
Welcome, Flint.

933
01:04:57,672 --> 01:04:59,697
That's fry oil.

934
01:05:06,347 --> 01:05:07,780
Flint, you have a call.

935
01:05:07,949 --> 01:05:09,177
Flint, you have a-

936
01:05:09,350 --> 01:05:10,874
Dad. Oh, okay, great.

937
01:05:11,052 --> 01:05:13,816
On the screen there's a file
marked "kill code."

938
01:05:13,988 --> 01:05:16,650
- What-?
- Move that into my e-mail window...

939
01:05:17,625 --> 01:05:19,889
...type in my name, and press send.

940
01:05:22,363 --> 01:05:23,387
- Window?
- Okay, Dad...

941
01:05:23,565 --> 01:05:26,557
...you see the thing that looks like
a little piece of paper?

942
01:05:26,734 --> 01:05:28,224
Use the mouse to drag it.

943
01:05:28,436 --> 01:05:30,404
- Drag it? Drag it.
- Drag it. Drag it.

944
01:05:30,605 --> 01:05:33,096
Right? Okay. Great. Okay, great.

945
01:05:33,274 --> 01:05:34,673
It's not dragging.

946
01:05:34,842 --> 01:05:36,867
Drag it across the desktop.

947
01:05:39,814 --> 01:05:42,942
- That didn't do anything.
- Of course it didn't! You know what?

948
01:05:47,088 --> 01:05:48,112
Go, go, go.

949
01:05:48,289 --> 01:05:50,553
Hoist those sails. Toast that bread.

950
01:05:50,959 --> 01:05:52,756
We are running out of time.

951
01:05:56,431 --> 01:05:58,490
Let's move out. Go, go, go.

952
01:05:58,666 --> 01:06:00,497
We can do it.
Come on, move it, move it.

953
01:06:00,668 --> 01:06:04,001
Good job. That's what I'm talking
about. Everybody head to the docks.

954
01:06:10,945 --> 01:06:12,276
Wait, wait.

955
01:06:12,447 --> 01:06:14,915
I have an important announcement.

956
01:06:16,484 --> 01:06:17,781
See you, suckers.

957
01:06:18,620 --> 01:06:19,985
Bon voyage.

958
01:06:20,855 --> 01:06:23,653
And bon appétit.

959
01:06:31,633 --> 01:06:34,067
- Cal.
- Calvin.

960
01:06:43,544 --> 01:06:45,171
Cal, get back here.

961
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:54,147
- Foodalanche.
- Cal.

962
01:06:54,322 --> 01:06:55,983
I'm not gonna lose you again.

963
01:06:56,157 --> 01:06:57,886
Baby.

964
01:07:02,330 --> 01:07:04,525
Hold on tight, Calvin.

965
01:07:37,198 --> 01:07:41,225
Everybody head south.
We gotta stay ahead of that storm.

966
01:07:44,305 --> 01:07:45,897
- Now what?
- Just click "send."

967
01:07:46,074 --> 01:07:48,508
Flint, the Fliminadifiserser's
right down there!

968
01:07:48,710 --> 01:07:52,009
- Dad, hurry.
- Send. Send.

969
01:07:52,180 --> 01:07:53,545
Oh, wait.

970
01:07:56,751 --> 01:07:58,719
Dad? Dad? Can you hear me?

971
01:07:59,287 --> 01:08:00,948
Dad?

972
01:08:01,489 --> 01:08:02,683
Hey, guys?

973
01:08:07,929 --> 01:08:10,762
Holy crap balls.

974
01:08:11,199 --> 01:08:12,962
Go, go, go.

975
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:21,608
I don't know.
I think they're kind of cute.

976
01:08:21,776 --> 01:08:24,040
I mean, this one just walked
right up to me and-

977
01:08:24,212 --> 01:08:25,736
He's got me!

978
01:08:27,682 --> 01:08:29,343
- They ate Brent.
- They ate Brent.

979
01:08:30,485 --> 01:08:34,421
Dad, I'm surrounded
by man-eating chickens right now.

980
01:08:35,490 --> 01:08:36,787
So if this is goodbye...

981
01:08:38,226 --> 01:08:40,592
...thanks for trying
to set me straight.

982
01:08:41,129 --> 01:08:43,723
Figured it out a little late, I guess.

983
01:08:44,732 --> 01:08:46,324
Okay, bye.

984
01:09:04,519 --> 01:09:06,111
Dad.

985
01:09:07,822 --> 01:09:10,552
Hey, give me that phone back.

986
01:09:28,709 --> 01:09:29,903
Baby Brent?

987
01:09:30,077 --> 01:09:33,103
I'm not Baby Brent anymore.

988
01:09:33,281 --> 01:09:36,079
I'm Chicken Brent.

989
01:09:36,250 --> 01:09:40,186
And I'm finally contributing
to society.

990
01:09:40,354 --> 01:09:42,185
Crotch kick.

991
01:09:48,262 --> 01:09:52,494
Now go, you crazy kids,
and save the world.

992
01:09:52,667 --> 01:09:55,329
You did it, Chicken Brent.
You really did it.

993
01:09:55,503 --> 01:09:57,471
Go, go, go.

994
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:01,631
It should be right down this hole.

995
01:10:04,111 --> 01:10:05,135
That's peanut brittle.

996
01:10:06,948 --> 01:10:10,384
If either one of us touches it,
we'll go into anaphylactic shock.

997
01:10:10,852 --> 01:10:13,286
Actually, I'm not entirely allergic
to peanuts.

998
01:10:13,454 --> 01:10:17,151
I might have just said that
to get you to like me.

999
01:10:17,325 --> 01:10:21,489
So you really thought having allergies
would make you more attractive?

1000
01:10:25,032 --> 01:10:26,897
Mustache.

1001
01:10:27,068 --> 01:10:28,695
Mus-

1002
01:10:37,144 --> 01:10:39,635
- Sesame bagel.
- Hey, taxi.

1003
01:10:39,814 --> 01:10:41,645
- Taxi.
- Taxi.

1004
01:10:41,816 --> 01:10:44,478
I asked for extra mustard.

1005
01:10:50,458 --> 01:10:52,926
I was right.

1006
01:11:02,270 --> 01:11:03,498
Hot tea?

1007
01:11:03,671 --> 01:11:05,696
Did he say hot tea?

1008
01:11:07,008 --> 01:11:10,637
"You are about to be crushed
by a giant corn."

1009
01:11:10,811 --> 01:11:12,472
Run.

1010
01:11:14,615 --> 01:11:17,516
It looks like the food storm
is following an unusual pattern...

1011
01:11:17,685 --> 01:11:20,017
...of hitting the world's
famous landmarks first...

1012
01:11:20,187 --> 01:11:23,315
...and is now spreading
to the rest of the globe.

1013
01:11:24,959 --> 01:11:26,051
What the what?

1014
01:11:26,227 --> 01:11:28,752
Hurry up, guys.

1015
01:11:28,963 --> 01:11:31,761
After I plug my phone into
the FLDSMDFR and destroy it...

1016
01:11:31,933 --> 01:11:35,699
...I'll tug on the liquorice twice
and you'll pull me back up, okay?

1017
01:11:36,103 --> 01:11:37,798
Sounds great.

1018
01:11:48,282 --> 01:11:49,544
Oh, no.

1019
01:11:54,589 --> 01:11:55,954
You got cut, didn't you?

1020
01:11:57,325 --> 01:11:59,088
It's just a scratch.

1021
01:12:00,261 --> 01:12:03,958
Brent, you need to take Sam back to
the plane to get her an allergy shot.

1022
01:12:04,131 --> 01:12:05,291
Just a second.

1023
01:12:05,466 --> 01:12:06,728
What? No.

1024
01:12:07,201 --> 01:12:10,261
- Let go, Sam.
- I'm not gonna let you go.

1025
01:12:10,438 --> 01:12:13,305
Flint, you'll be stuck down there.

1026
01:12:13,474 --> 01:12:15,635
It's not ideal, no.

1027
01:12:16,243 --> 01:12:18,643
Come with us. We'll start over.

1028
01:12:18,813 --> 01:12:22,249
We'll live underground.
Use bacon for clothes.

1029
01:12:22,416 --> 01:12:24,179
Sam, that's not a very good plan.

1030
01:12:24,352 --> 01:12:26,980
It is if it means
I don't have to lose you.

1031
01:12:27,755 --> 01:12:30,087
Look, I like you, okay?

1032
01:12:31,559 --> 01:12:34,289
Like- Like, as a friend?

1033
01:12:34,462 --> 01:12:36,259
No.

1034
01:12:36,464 --> 01:12:39,126
Like, "like you" like you.

1035
01:12:41,836 --> 01:12:43,531
Me too.

1036
01:12:45,206 --> 01:12:47,197
But about you.

1037
01:12:52,613 --> 01:12:53,671
Goodbye, Sam.

1038
01:12:53,848 --> 01:12:56,373
Flint. No.

1039
01:12:56,550 --> 01:12:57,812
Hang on, Sam.

1040
01:12:57,985 --> 01:13:00,886
Dr. Manny's got the medicine
for your face.

1041
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:08,021
Pickles.

1042
01:13:09,497 --> 01:13:10,691
Beets.

1043
01:13:10,865 --> 01:13:13,265
Banana.

1044
01:13:13,434 --> 01:13:16,130
Strawberry.

1045
01:13:27,415 --> 01:13:30,384
- Manny, we're on our way. Hurry.
- Hang on, Sam.

1046
01:13:30,551 --> 01:13:32,917
I'm circling the blowhole.

1047
01:13:36,824 --> 01:13:37,848
Scared.

1048
01:13:49,003 --> 01:13:50,027
Gummi Bears.

1049
01:13:50,204 --> 01:13:52,695
Play with us, play with us.
Eat us, eat us.

1050
01:13:53,841 --> 01:13:55,206
Hungry.

1051
01:13:55,976 --> 01:13:59,173
Hungry. Gummi Bears. Gummi Bears.
Gummi Bears. Steve hungry. Hungry.

1052
01:13:59,346 --> 01:14:01,405
Steve starving. Hungry.
Hungry. Starving.

1053
01:14:08,122 --> 01:14:10,283
Manny. Where are you?

1054
01:14:34,181 --> 01:14:36,308
- She touched a peanut or something.
- Oh, boy.

1055
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:48,118
Corn.

1056
01:15:22,730 --> 01:15:23,754
Grabbing.

1057
01:15:24,298 --> 01:15:26,266
Tying. Throwing.

1058
01:15:29,236 --> 01:15:31,033
Waiting.

1059
01:15:33,107 --> 01:15:34,131
Swinging.

1060
01:15:43,350 --> 01:15:46,217
Sorry, old friend.
The kitchen's closed.

1061
01:15:50,925 --> 01:15:51,949
Fight the power!

1062
01:15:52,359 --> 01:15:53,451
Dad.

1063
01:15:53,627 --> 01:15:54,821
No.

1064
01:16:35,836 --> 01:16:40,205
When it rains, you put on a coat...

1065
01:16:40,374 --> 01:16:42,399
...of Spray-On Shoes.

1066
01:16:44,745 --> 01:16:47,407
Yeah.

1067
01:17:02,263 --> 01:17:04,925
Just- There were chickens-

1068
01:17:05,099 --> 01:17:06,191
Where's Flint?

1069
01:17:09,870 --> 01:17:11,497
No!

1070
01:17:12,139 --> 01:17:13,834
I know, kid.

1071
01:17:14,008 --> 01:17:15,270
I know.

1072
01:17:24,485 --> 01:17:26,749
- Cool.
- Yeah. All right.

1073
01:18:04,525 --> 01:18:05,856
Flint?

1074
01:18:09,029 --> 01:18:10,428
I'm sorry.

1075
01:18:28,849 --> 01:18:31,579
Your son was a great man.

1076
01:18:56,810 --> 01:18:59,574
- Steve.
- Steve.

1077
01:18:59,747 --> 01:19:01,408
- Flint.
- Brent.

1078
01:19:01,582 --> 01:19:03,140
- Flint.
- Cal.

1079
01:19:03,317 --> 01:19:04,409
- Steve.
- Flint.

1080
01:19:04,585 --> 01:19:05,813
- Earl.
- Flint.

1081
01:19:05,986 --> 01:19:08,318
- You guy.
- Steve.

1082
01:19:10,691 --> 01:19:11,919
Sam.

1083
01:19:12,092 --> 01:19:13,252
Flint.

1084
01:19:14,228 --> 01:19:15,320
Sam.

1085
01:19:15,496 --> 01:19:17,191
- Flint.
- Flint.

1086
01:19:17,364 --> 01:19:18,695
- Dad.
- Steve.

1087
01:19:18,866 --> 01:19:20,663
Flint.

1088
01:19:24,505 --> 01:19:28,464
Look, when you-
When you cast your line...

1089
01:19:28,642 --> 01:19:32,442
...if it's not straight-

1090
01:19:33,180 --> 01:19:35,375
Oh, for crying out loud.

1091
01:19:39,219 --> 01:19:41,084
I'm proud of you, Flint.

1092
01:19:41,655 --> 01:19:44,283
I'm amazed that someone
as ordinary as me...

1093
01:19:44,458 --> 01:19:48,519
...could be the father of someone
as extraordinary as you.

1094
01:19:48,695 --> 01:19:51,994
You're talented,
you're a total original.

1095
01:19:52,166 --> 01:19:54,999
And your lab is breathtaking.

1096
01:19:55,169 --> 01:19:58,161
Your mom, she always knew
you were going to be special.

1097
01:19:58,338 --> 01:20:01,432
And if she were alive today,
she'd tell us both:

1098
01:20:01,608 --> 01:20:03,769
"I told you so."

1099
01:20:04,711 --> 01:20:07,805
Now, look,
when I take this thing off...

1100
01:20:07,981 --> 01:20:11,439
...and you hear me
make a fishing metaphor...

1101
01:20:12,219 --> 01:20:15,120
...just know
that fishing metaphor means:

1102
01:20:15,289 --> 01:20:17,120
I love my son.

1103
01:20:17,291 --> 01:20:19,589
I love you too, Dad.

1104
01:20:30,671 --> 01:20:32,536
So where were we?

1105
01:20:32,706 --> 01:20:34,503
You were about to kiss me.

1106
01:20:34,675 --> 01:20:36,700
Were you gonna kiss me back?

1107
01:20:36,877 --> 01:20:38,367
Why don't you find out?

1108
01:20:38,545 --> 01:20:41,446
Because I don't want to go for it and
then get shut down again.

1109
01:20:41,615 --> 01:20:43,378
- Just kiss me.
- You know-

1110
01:20:53,327 --> 01:20:56,524
Yeah. I'm a chicken.

1111
01:21:14,481 --> 01:21:18,281
This was not well thought out.

1112
01:21:19,305 --> 01:22:19,378
