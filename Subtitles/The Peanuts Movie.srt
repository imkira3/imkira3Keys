2
00:01:39,954 --> 00:01:41,390
Beethoven.

3
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:44,858
Linus, time to get up.

4
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:47,696
You don't want to be late for school.

5
00:01:47,796 --> 00:01:49,797
Get up!

6
00:01:49,897 --> 00:01:51,332
My blanket!

7
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,427
Hello?

8
00:01:55,527 --> 00:01:58,812
Snow day? Snow day!

9
00:01:59,858 --> 00:02:01,584
No school today!

10
00:02:01,934 --> 00:02:03,916
Dreams do come true.

11
00:02:04,845 --> 00:02:06,830
No school!

12
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,779
Franklin and Peppermint Patty
are on my team!

13
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,005
I got my hockey stick!

14
00:02:14,105 --> 00:02:16,123
- I got my skates!
- Who has the pucks?

15
00:02:16,223 --> 00:02:19,410
- Looking sharp today, Pigpen.
- Sorry I'm late.

16
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:20,903
What's taking him so long?

17
00:02:21,003 --> 00:02:23,005
Come on, Charlie Brown!

18
00:02:23,755 --> 00:02:26,483
No. Not quite. That's the one!

19
00:02:36,494 --> 00:02:40,189
I've got my kite!
Today's the day. I can feel it!

20
00:02:40,289 --> 00:02:43,018
- A kite? Today?
- In the middle of winter?

21
00:02:43,118 --> 00:02:46,225
- Come on, guys!
- Only Charlie Brown.

22
00:02:47,405 --> 00:02:51,483
A new kite, a perfect breeze.
It all feels just right.

23
00:02:51,783 --> 00:02:54,479
Now that the Kite-Eating Tree
is sleeping for the winter

24
00:02:54,579 --> 00:02:57,114
we have nothing to fear.

25
00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:00,167
Lift off!

26
00:03:07,483 --> 00:03:10,594
Wait a minute. It's in the air.
It's flying!

27
00:03:10,694 --> 00:03:13,681
Hey, guys! Look! Look, I did it!

28
00:03:20,896 --> 00:03:24,042
Hey, Charlie Brown. Still no luck, huh?

29
00:03:24,142 --> 00:03:28,211
Remember, it's the courage
to continue that counts!

30
00:03:28,311 --> 00:03:30,290
Runaway kite!

31
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:32,133
Sorry!

32
00:03:35,662 --> 00:03:36,755
No brakes!

33
00:03:37,055 --> 00:03:40,023
And now, for my famous triple Axel.

34
00:03:40,123 --> 00:03:42,860
Prepare to be amazed.

35
00:03:43,961 --> 00:03:46,696
- A quadruple!
- Bravo!

36
00:03:51,385 --> 00:03:54,161
Stupid Kite-Eating Tree.

37
00:03:56,173 --> 00:03:58,241
Good grief.

38
00:03:58,341 --> 00:04:01,487
You blockhead! I should have known.

39
00:04:01,687 --> 00:04:06,426
What kind of a person tries to fly
a kite in the middle of winter?

40
00:04:06,526 --> 00:04:11,389
Don't you ever know when to give up?
You will never get that kite to fly.

41
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:16,094
Why? Because you're Charlie Brown!

42
00:04:20,848 --> 00:04:23,167
- Thanks, Linus.
- Listen, Charlie Brown.

43
00:04:23,267 --> 00:04:27,839
Ignoring what my sister Lucy says
has enabled me to make it this far in life.

44
00:04:27,939 --> 00:04:31,358
What would I do
without a good friend like you?

45
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,708
My Sweet Babboo!

46
00:04:40,101 --> 00:04:42,598
Isn't he the cutest thing?

47
00:04:43,688 --> 00:04:45,881
Careful, sir!

48
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:53,514
Watch the curls!

49
00:05:20,033 --> 00:05:24,420
I don't care what Lucy says. I may have
had troubles in the past flying a kite,

50
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,713
and I may have never won a baseball game

51
00:05:26,813 --> 00:05:29,634
but it's not for the lack of trying.

52
00:05:29,784 --> 00:05:34,955
My pitching has to improve if I come
out here to my trusty mound every day.

53
00:05:38,134 --> 00:05:41,365
Charlie Brown is not a quitter.

54
00:05:50,546 --> 00:05:52,556
Bottom of the 9th. Two outs.

55
00:05:52,656 --> 00:05:56,776
A strike-out here would make
the pitcher an instant hero.

56
00:05:57,804 --> 00:06:01,574
It all comes down to this one pitch.

57
00:06:11,993 --> 00:06:14,461
Let's see if you can handle my fastball.

58
00:06:14,561 --> 00:06:16,530
Ol' Number One. The Heater.

59
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,315
The Brown Bullet.

60
00:06:44,408 --> 00:06:47,313
It's going to be a long winter.

61
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,639
Someone's moving in
across the street from me?

62
00:06:57,739 --> 00:06:59,707
Hey, gang, look!
There's a new kid moving in!

63
00:06:59,807 --> 00:07:02,034
Big brother, pull yourself together!

64
00:07:02,134 --> 00:07:05,062
- Come on, Charlie Brown.
- Get out of the way.

65
00:07:05,162 --> 00:07:08,307
Hey, guys. What do you see? Who is it?

66
00:07:08,407 --> 00:07:11,126
I think I see a piano!
I hope he loves Beethoven!

67
00:07:11,226 --> 00:07:16,174
Beethoven, Schmeethoven.
Maybe he will appreciate my natural beauty.

68
00:07:16,274 --> 00:07:19,660
Who cares about that? As long as
he's a better goalie than Marcie.

69
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,663
- You're hurting me, sir.
- I'm sorry, but it's true.

70
00:07:22,763 --> 00:07:24,706
No, you're pulling on my hair!

71
00:07:24,806 --> 00:07:27,543
I just hope he'll have an open mind
about the Great Pumpkin.

72
00:07:27,643 --> 00:07:29,386
I think they have a toaster!

73
00:07:29,486 --> 00:07:32,715
<i>I just hope this new kid
has never heard of me.</i>

74
00:07:32,815 --> 00:07:36,427
<i>He would know nothing
of my past imperfections.</i>

75
00:07:37,027 --> 00:07:41,366
<i>It's not often you get the opportunity
to start over with a clean slate.</i>

76
00:07:41,466 --> 00:07:44,184
<i>This time, things will be different.</i>

77
00:07:51,576 --> 00:07:53,667
He did it!

78
00:08:03,037 --> 00:08:07,655
Snoopy... why is it that everything
I try turns out wrong?

79
00:08:07,755 --> 00:08:10,486
Sometimes I wonder
if the kids really like me.

80
00:08:11,086 --> 00:08:14,832
Maybe that new kid will see me
for who I really am, like you.

81
00:08:14,932 --> 00:08:18,311
A dog doesn't try
to give advice or judge you.

82
00:08:18,411 --> 00:08:20,796
They just love you for who you are.

83
00:08:20,896 --> 00:08:24,374
It's nice to have someone
that will just sit and listen to you.

84
00:08:29,396 --> 00:08:31,131
Man's best friend.

85
00:08:33,301 --> 00:08:37,691
You can't come to school, Snoopy.
Now be a good dog and go home.

86
00:08:49,441 --> 00:08:51,902
No dogs allowed!

87
00:08:57,024 --> 00:08:59,853
- I think I saw the new kid.
- Did you see that moving truck arrive?

88
00:08:59,953 --> 00:09:02,062
Who do you suppose it will be?

89
00:09:02,162 --> 00:09:04,631
The new kid is coming!

90
00:09:04,731 --> 00:09:08,051
- That's not the new kid.
- Hey, Charlie Brown.

91
00:09:11,246 --> 00:09:13,315
Good morning, Linus.
What do you have there?

92
00:09:13,415 --> 00:09:15,368
It's my turn for show and tell today.

93
00:09:15,468 --> 00:09:18,480
This is the same plane
flown by Manfred von Richthofen.

94
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,348
- Who?
- The Red Baron.

95
00:09:20,448 --> 00:09:23,200
The most famous aviator
during The Great War.

96
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,434
It's not real, is it?

97
00:09:31,191 --> 00:09:33,739
My naturally curly hair!

98
00:09:37,681 --> 00:09:39,387
Duck, Linus!

99
00:09:45,223 --> 00:09:48,173
Yes, Miss Othmar.

100
00:09:50,645 --> 00:09:52,379
Sir?

101
00:09:52,479 --> 00:09:54,114
Sir.

102
00:09:54,214 --> 00:09:55,700
Sir!

103
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,452
Two! No, three! Was I close?

104
00:09:58,552 --> 00:10:01,500
Class hasn't started yet, sir.

105
00:10:02,891 --> 00:10:06,356
What? The new kid is joining our class.

106
00:10:11,373 --> 00:10:15,223
- She doesn't look like a goalie to me.
- Wow! She's pretty.

107
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,863
She's not that pretty.

108
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,790
Linus.

109
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:26,229
She looked at me!

110
00:10:34,479 --> 00:10:37,425
Not the yearly standardized test again!

111
00:10:37,525 --> 00:10:42,312
Ma'am, will this test accurately reflect
the knowledge we have gained here?

112
00:10:42,747 --> 00:10:46,367
Is it fair we, at this young age...

113
00:10:46,717 --> 00:10:48,252
Yes, ma'am.

114
00:10:53,608 --> 00:10:55,176
Thanks.

115
00:10:55,276 --> 00:10:59,263
<i>Question 1.
"If you had 6 red tomatoes and..."</i>

116
00:11:00,098 --> 00:11:01,512
<i>Red.</i>

117
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:14,461
<i>Come on, focus.</i>

118
00:11:14,561 --> 00:11:17,238
<i>First impressions are everything.</i>

119
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:45,342
No dogs!

120
00:11:59,357 --> 00:12:02,418
Already done? She must be smart.

121
00:12:14,129 --> 00:12:16,725
<i>It's got teeth marks.</i>

122
00:12:17,525 --> 00:12:19,885
<i>She nibbles on her pencil like I do.</i>

123
00:12:19,985 --> 00:12:22,446
<i>We have something in common!</i>

124
00:12:22,946 --> 00:12:25,181
One minute left?

125
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,258
Out of my way, Chuck!

126
00:12:35,417 --> 00:12:38,331
Write our names? Yes, ma'am.

127
00:12:40,481 --> 00:12:43,158
Chuck, are you trying to hold my hand?

128
00:12:43,258 --> 00:12:45,860
You sly dog.

129
00:12:47,637 --> 00:12:52,960
Hi, I'm Brown Charlie.
I mean, "Barnie Clown." I mean...

130
00:12:57,765 --> 00:13:00,318
What are you in for?

131
00:13:00,418 --> 00:13:04,254
Have you ever had that feeling
when you can't stop smiling?

132
00:13:05,031 --> 00:13:07,575
Your heart pounds inside your chest?

133
00:13:07,675 --> 00:13:11,236
You try to stand
but your knees become weak?

134
00:13:11,636 --> 00:13:15,766
And then that Little Red-Haired Girl
glances at you.

135
00:13:15,866 --> 00:13:20,563
And all of life's possibilities
become so clear.

136
00:13:20,663 --> 00:13:23,315
And then you realize...

137
00:13:23,415 --> 00:13:27,189
she has no idea you're alive.

138
00:13:27,289 --> 00:13:29,347
Why am I here?

139
00:13:29,447 --> 00:13:33,574
Because I just came down
with a serious case of inadequacy.

140
00:14:34,411 --> 00:14:38,573
<i>Here she comes. This is my chance
to make a good impression.</i>

141
00:14:42,745 --> 00:14:44,146
Maybe tomorrow.

142
00:15:25,213 --> 00:15:28,060
<i>It was a dark and stormy night.</i>

143
00:15:30,984 --> 00:15:33,345
<i>High above the French countryside</i>

144
00:15:33,445 --> 00:15:37,724
<i>the World War I Flying Ace
had never been so close...</i>

145
00:15:37,824 --> 00:15:42,204
<i>to his lifelong enemy...
the infamous Red Baron.</i>

146
00:17:04,996 --> 00:17:07,814
<i>The key is keeping a low profile.</i>

147
00:17:07,914 --> 00:17:10,830
<i>For now, we just keep our distance.</i>

148
00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:16,749
Snoopy!

149
00:17:17,049 --> 00:17:18,933
No!

150
00:17:22,413 --> 00:17:24,407
That was a close one.

151
00:17:32,339 --> 00:17:35,670
If I could only work up the nerve
to go over there, I'd...

152
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:39,455
- What are you looking at, big brother?
- Are you crazy?

153
00:17:42,374 --> 00:17:45,101
You're in love!

154
00:17:54,811 --> 00:17:59,474
<i>Chapter 1.
It was the greatest love story ever told.</i>

155
00:18:33,167 --> 00:18:35,704
<i>Her name was Fifi.</i>

156
00:18:35,804 --> 00:18:40,289
<i>She was the most beautiful thing
he had ever seen.</i>

157
00:20:09,696 --> 00:20:13,167
I can't believe I'm about to talk
to the Little Red-Haired Girl.

158
00:20:13,267 --> 00:20:17,353
It's moments like this
when you need your faithful friend.

159
00:20:24,596 --> 00:20:29,141
Yep. If there's one person you want
by your side at a moment like this...

160
00:20:29,241 --> 00:20:31,668
it's your loyal dog.

161
00:20:47,301 --> 00:20:50,566
Hello? Hello?

162
00:20:53,141 --> 00:20:55,458
She said, "Hello"!

163
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:06,989
Charlie Brown. What brings you
out here so late in the day?

164
00:21:07,663 --> 00:21:09,958
I need your advice on girls, Lucy.

165
00:21:10,058 --> 00:21:14,221
You're a girl, right? Let's just say
there's this girl I'd like to impress.

166
00:21:14,361 --> 00:21:16,964
But she's something and I'm nothing.

167
00:21:17,064 --> 00:21:20,409
If I were something and she
was nothing, I could talk to her.

168
00:21:20,509 --> 00:21:23,480
Or, if she was nothing and I
was nothing, I could talk to her.

169
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:28,652
But she's something and I'm nothing,
so I just can't talk to her.

170
00:21:28,752 --> 00:21:32,714
You're being ridiculous, Charlie Brown.
Why, you have much to offer.

171
00:21:32,814 --> 00:21:35,966
She has a pretty face
and pretty faces make me nervous.

172
00:21:36,066 --> 00:21:38,810
Pretty face? Pretty face?

173
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:42,599
I have a pretty face! How come
my face doesn't make you nervous?

174
00:21:42,699 --> 00:21:46,260
How come you can talk to me,
Charlie Brown?

175
00:21:48,929 --> 00:21:52,117
I just need to know the secret
to winning her heart.

176
00:21:52,849 --> 00:21:55,527
Look into this mirror, Charlie Brown.

177
00:21:55,627 --> 00:22:00,274
This is the face of failure.
A classic failure face.

178
00:22:00,374 --> 00:22:02,634
Do you think girls like failures,
Charlie Brown?

179
00:22:02,734 --> 00:22:06,231
- Well, no.
- Girls want someone with proven success.

180
00:22:06,331 --> 00:22:10,089
Have you won any awards?
Like a Congressional Medal of Honor?

181
00:22:10,189 --> 00:22:12,637
Or a Nobel Peace Prize?

182
00:22:12,737 --> 00:22:17,157
What are your real estate holdings?
Do you have a diversified portfolio?

183
00:22:17,257 --> 00:22:20,478
Let me let you in on a little secret,
Charlie Brown.

184
00:22:20,578 --> 00:22:25,239
If you really want to impress girls,
you need to show them you're a winner.

185
00:22:25,339 --> 00:22:29,921
A winner? Me?
Lucy, you may be on to something.

186
00:22:30,021 --> 00:22:34,367
Of course, when I say "you,"
you know I don't mean you personally.

187
00:22:37,595 --> 00:22:40,318
That will be five cents, please.

188
00:22:44,201 --> 00:22:48,496
Nickels, nickels, nickels.
What a beautiful sound.

189
00:22:48,606 --> 00:22:52,134
"Congratulations. You're now on your way
to becoming a winner."

190
00:22:52,234 --> 00:22:56,639
"Step 1. Forget everything
you ever knew about yourself."

191
00:22:57,381 --> 00:22:59,341
Okay. "Step 2."

192
00:22:59,641 --> 00:23:01,643
"Project confidence."

193
00:23:01,743 --> 00:23:03,928
"Don't slouch."

194
00:23:06,056 --> 00:23:09,087
"Maintain eye contact at all times."

195
00:23:29,414 --> 00:23:32,052
Giddy-up, little pony!

196
00:23:33,358 --> 00:23:34,318
What are you doing?

197
00:23:34,418 --> 00:23:38,030
I'm going to be a rodeo star
in the big talent show.

198
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:40,375
When I win that first-prize ribbon

199
00:23:40,475 --> 00:23:43,266
there will be no one who hasn't
heard the name Sally Brown

200
00:23:43,366 --> 00:23:46,064
and her trusty horse, Broomstick!

201
00:23:46,164 --> 00:23:50,001
Win the talent show.
Now that's a great idea.

202
00:23:50,101 --> 00:23:52,478
This is just what Lucy was talking about.

203
00:24:34,295 --> 00:24:36,422
We're ready.

204
00:24:52,205 --> 00:24:55,907
- Look at that.
- Is that Charlie Brown?

205
00:25:06,511 --> 00:25:07,662
She's here.

206
00:25:07,762 --> 00:25:11,733
I have a really good feeling that tonight
she will see the new Charlie Brown.

207
00:25:12,233 --> 00:25:17,254
Charlie Brown? As your psychiatrist,
I'm surprised to see you here.

208
00:25:17,354 --> 00:25:21,768
A person with all your insecurities
normally wouldn't enter a talent show.

209
00:25:21,868 --> 00:25:23,261
I'm...

210
00:25:24,861 --> 00:25:27,451
I ought to slug you!

211
00:25:28,241 --> 00:25:31,610
I've been kissed by a dog!
I have dog germs!

212
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:35,548
Get hot water! Get some disinfectant!
Get some iodine!

213
00:25:35,648 --> 00:25:39,258
Let's keep this thing moving.
Time's a-wasting.

214
00:25:44,649 --> 00:25:48,560
Thank you! Break a leg, Chuck!

215
00:25:49,503 --> 00:25:52,775
Treat your assistant kindly, Charles.

216
00:25:52,875 --> 00:25:56,326
Okay, Sally, we're running behind,
so gallop, don't trot!

217
00:25:59,204 --> 00:26:02,401
Save the applause for the end, everyone.

218
00:26:02,734 --> 00:26:06,341
If you like this, wait for the encore!

219
00:26:09,157 --> 00:26:11,962
Your sister is really dying out there.

220
00:26:12,462 --> 00:26:15,787
Hey, that's not a real horse!

221
00:26:19,943 --> 00:26:22,745
Sorry, Charlie Brown.
This has gone on long enough.

222
00:26:22,845 --> 00:26:23,996
Drop the curtain!

223
00:26:24,096 --> 00:26:26,525
Don't do that.
She said she has a big finish.

224
00:26:26,625 --> 00:26:30,288
Well, it's either your act or hers.
We can't hold forever.

225
00:26:41,606 --> 00:26:43,916
Change of plans, Snoopy.

226
00:26:53,934 --> 00:26:55,226
Big brother?

227
00:26:56,186 --> 00:26:58,056
Rope me.

228
00:26:58,156 --> 00:27:00,703
That's not a real cow.

229
00:27:05,545 --> 00:27:07,965
I'm gonna get you!

230
00:27:19,843 --> 00:27:21,704
- Sorry, sir.
- Good one.

231
00:27:21,804 --> 00:27:24,330
Oh, Schroeder...

232
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:33,441
You can run, little dogie,
but you can't hide!

233
00:27:37,045 --> 00:27:39,637
This is going great!

234
00:27:40,998 --> 00:27:43,877
My name is Calamity Sally...

235
00:27:43,977 --> 00:27:48,474
the best bronc-busting, lasso-roping
cowgirl in this here town!

236
00:27:54,287 --> 00:27:56,663
Thanks, big brother.

237
00:28:03,521 --> 00:28:04,781
"Moo"?

238
00:28:05,481 --> 00:28:08,184
Well, nobody reads
the school paper anyhow.

239
00:28:12,096 --> 00:28:14,059
Look on the bright side, Charlie Brown.

240
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,060
They say there's no such thing
as bad publicity.

241
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:21,505
You're right, Linus.
She definitely knows who I am now.

242
00:28:24,274 --> 00:28:27,094
You know, Charlie Brown,
if you like her so much

243
00:28:27,194 --> 00:28:30,080
why not just walk up to her
and introduce yourself?

244
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:33,435
After the complete fool
I made out of myself last night?

245
00:28:33,535 --> 00:28:36,888
Yeah, and why don't I just
fly to the moon?

246
00:28:40,165 --> 00:28:42,973
<i>Oh, brother. She's talking to them?</i>

247
00:28:43,393 --> 00:28:46,313
<i>So much for a fresh start.</i>

248
00:28:46,413 --> 00:28:48,616
<i>Time is running out.</i>

249
00:28:49,216 --> 00:28:53,537
"Number 6." "Tell yourself, 'I am worthy.
I can do this."

250
00:28:53,637 --> 00:28:55,639
"'I have what it takes.'"

251
00:28:55,739 --> 00:28:57,582
Hello?

252
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:01,503
Your girlfriend's on the phone.

253
00:29:04,941 --> 00:29:07,359
- Hello?
- Hey, Chuck. This is Peppermint Patty.

254
00:29:07,459 --> 00:29:08,812
- How have you been?
- Well, I...

255
00:29:08,912 --> 00:29:11,489
Listen, I have some great news
for you, Chuck.

256
00:29:11,589 --> 00:29:15,710
The Winter Dance is in a few weeks
and I'm saving a dance for you.

257
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:19,272
Anyway, Marcie put me in charge
of the refreshment committee.

258
00:29:19,372 --> 00:29:22,566
I took it upon myself and signed you up
to make the cupcakes.

259
00:29:22,666 --> 00:29:25,361
You did what? I can't cook cupcakes.

260
00:29:25,461 --> 00:29:27,973
The only thing I do know
how to make is toast.

261
00:29:28,073 --> 00:29:30,940
Besides, why would I even want
to go to the Winter Dance?

262
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,461
Toast and cupcakes!
That sounds good, Chuck.

263
00:29:33,561 --> 00:29:36,327
- See you there.
- Hold on. I said...

264
00:29:36,427 --> 00:29:39,216
Hello? Hello?

265
00:29:41,695 --> 00:29:43,449
Rats.

266
00:30:14,473 --> 00:30:17,147
Hey! What's going on?

267
00:30:17,963 --> 00:30:20,510
Turn it down! Turn it down in there!

268
00:30:25,137 --> 00:30:27,630
She likes to dance.

269
00:31:16,064 --> 00:31:19,566
One, two, three, four.

270
00:31:19,666 --> 00:31:22,887
One, two, three, four.

271
00:31:22,987 --> 00:31:25,573
One, two, three, four.

272
00:31:25,673 --> 00:31:29,601
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.

273
00:31:29,701 --> 00:31:32,830
One, two, three, four.

274
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:40,262
- I could really use a dance partner.
- Good luck with that.

275
00:31:40,362 --> 00:31:42,957
One, two, three, four.

276
00:31:43,057 --> 00:31:45,368
Okay, Snoopy, I got the basics down.

277
00:31:45,468 --> 00:31:49,029
But if I'm going to win,
I need to step it up.

278
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:57,790
I can see it now.

279
00:32:04,545 --> 00:32:06,614
<i>We have our winners!</i>

280
00:32:06,714 --> 00:32:12,552
<i>Let us applaud them as they begin
the traditional dance of the champions!</i>

281
00:32:20,995 --> 00:32:22,856
Snoopy!

282
00:32:23,256 --> 00:32:27,369
Thanks for the help.
I left some cookies in your dog dish.

283
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:30,914
One, two, three, four.

284
00:32:31,264 --> 00:32:32,856
One, two...

285
00:32:42,275 --> 00:32:45,602
You know, I've always wanted
to dance with Pigpen.

286
00:32:45,702 --> 00:32:47,453
Yuck!

287
00:32:49,099 --> 00:32:53,397
Why isn't anyone dancing?
It's called a dance.

288
00:32:55,529 --> 00:32:58,024
- Oh, Sweet Babboo!
- Oh, no, here she comes!

289
00:32:58,124 --> 00:33:00,041
Someone needs to get this dance started.

290
00:33:00,141 --> 00:33:02,028
No!

291
00:33:20,438 --> 00:33:25,051
These cupcakes don't look half bad,
if I do say so myself.

292
00:33:25,151 --> 00:33:28,220
This time I've come totally prepared.

293
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,348
I couldn't have done it without you.

294
00:33:30,448 --> 00:33:34,435
The old Charlie Brown would still be
lying in bed with a stomachache.

295
00:33:39,707 --> 00:33:41,284
Good grief.

296
00:33:47,389 --> 00:33:50,696
Marcie, look! Everyone's here!

297
00:33:51,694 --> 00:33:54,021
Let me help you with that, Marcie.

298
00:33:54,121 --> 00:33:56,031
Such a gentleman, Charles.

299
00:33:58,826 --> 00:34:00,303
She's here.

300
00:34:04,231 --> 00:34:07,629
<i>Okay, ladies. It's time for you
to show off your best move.</i>

301
00:34:07,902 --> 00:34:11,297
<i>Which one of you will win the first half
of our dance competition</i>

302
00:34:11,397 --> 00:34:14,776
<i>and take home the trophy?
Let them hear it!</i>

303
00:34:15,226 --> 00:34:17,319
Nice moves.

304
00:34:22,824 --> 00:34:25,816
<i>Listen to that noise!
I think it's safe to say</i>

305
00:34:25,916 --> 00:34:28,426
- <i>we know who our winner is!</i>
- She won.

306
00:34:28,526 --> 00:34:31,697
<i>And now, it's the gentlemen's turn
to see who will be joining</i>

307
00:34:31,797 --> 00:34:35,029
<i>our lovely winning lady
for the final dance of the night.</i>

308
00:34:35,129 --> 00:34:38,143
- I got to get out there.
- <i>Are you guys ready?</i>

309
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:40,716
<i>Then here we go!</i>

310
00:34:54,882 --> 00:34:56,884
This is it.

311
00:34:56,984 --> 00:34:59,511
It's now or never.

312
00:35:10,365 --> 00:35:14,525
Check out the moves on that
funny-looking kid with the big nose!

313
00:35:15,552 --> 00:35:18,238
<i>Yeah! All right!</i>

314
00:35:29,083 --> 00:35:33,645
<i>Okay, just like you practiced.
Remember the steps.</i>

315
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:36,849
<i>One, two, three, four.</i>

316
00:35:36,949 --> 00:35:39,776
<i>One, two, three...</i>

317
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:48,978
- Charlie Brown?
- All right!

318
00:35:49,695 --> 00:35:52,090
<i>It looks like we may have a winner here!</i>

319
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:56,659
<i>It's going to happen. I'm about to dance
with the Little Red-Haired Girl.</i>

320
00:36:04,826 --> 00:36:06,608
Let's get out of here!

321
00:36:09,665 --> 00:36:11,541
Do I know you?

322
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:16,286
Wait! It's not over yet.

323
00:36:21,152 --> 00:36:23,120
Thanks, buddy.

324
00:36:26,198 --> 00:36:30,106
I hate to say it, Snoopy,
it seems like the harder I try,

325
00:36:30,206 --> 00:36:32,670
the further away she gets.

326
00:36:46,051 --> 00:36:48,771
<i>The Flying Ace took to the skies.</i>

327
00:36:48,871 --> 00:36:53,750
<i>He searched endlessly for the girl
who had stolen his heart.</i>

328
00:39:07,009 --> 00:39:10,462
Daydreaming will not make her materialize,
Charlie Brown. She's not here.

329
00:39:10,562 --> 00:39:13,524
- Daydreaming? Me?
- She'll be back on Monday.

330
00:39:13,624 --> 00:39:17,045
I heard she went back east to take care
of her grandmother, who isn't feeling well.

331
00:39:17,145 --> 00:39:20,855
She seems like the kind of person
who would do that sort of thing.

332
00:39:22,025 --> 00:39:24,194
Not another book report!

333
00:39:24,394 --> 00:39:26,270
Time to pick our partners.

334
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:28,707
No boys. No boys.

335
00:39:28,807 --> 00:39:30,399
Please.

336
00:39:30,499 --> 00:39:33,141
- Patty! Yes!
- All right!

337
00:39:33,936 --> 00:39:35,670
Nope.

338
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,791
Yes.

339
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:41,135
Schroeder!

340
00:39:41,235 --> 00:39:46,122
There's no denying it.
It was written in the cards.

341
00:40:01,013 --> 00:40:03,925
<i>The Little Red-Haired Girl. My lucky day!</i>

342
00:40:04,025 --> 00:40:07,529
<i>This changes everything.
She will see the new me.</i>

343
00:40:07,629 --> 00:40:12,166
<i>And together we will win the gold star!
After that, anything is possible!</i>

344
00:40:12,266 --> 00:40:14,526
<i>We could be the first kids
to land on the moon!</i>

345
00:40:14,626 --> 00:40:19,539
<i>One small step for kids,
one giant leap for Charlie Brown.</i>

346
00:40:22,652 --> 00:40:24,195
You've got to help me, Linus.

347
00:40:24,295 --> 00:40:27,682
I'm not sure I can handle being partners
with the Little Red-Haired Girl.

348
00:40:27,782 --> 00:40:32,202
I need to slow things down. Maybe
I'm not ready for a serious relationship.

349
00:40:32,302 --> 00:40:35,473
How will I support her?
I can't afford a mortgage.

350
00:40:35,573 --> 00:40:40,203
- What if I'm put into escrow?
- Charlie Brown, you're being ridiculous.

351
00:40:40,303 --> 00:40:43,448
You're the only person I know
who can turn a simple book report

352
00:40:43,548 --> 00:40:45,300
into a lifelong commitment.

353
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,402
I've never been responsible
for anything before.

354
00:40:48,502 --> 00:40:52,056
This could be the worst thing
that's ever happened to her!

355
00:40:55,443 --> 00:40:59,563
Linus, it just hit me.
I think I know how to become her hero.

356
00:40:59,663 --> 00:41:01,995
While she's away taking care
of her grandmother,

357
00:41:02,095 --> 00:41:04,785
I could complete the book report
for the two of us.

358
00:41:05,285 --> 00:41:09,422
That's one way to go,
but if you want my advice...

359
00:41:10,884 --> 00:41:14,059
They're posting the test scores. Come on.

360
00:41:14,244 --> 00:41:16,839
Look. Someone got a perfect score, sir.

361
00:41:16,939 --> 00:41:19,568
You would have to be a genius
to get a perfect score.

362
00:41:19,668 --> 00:41:22,845
- I didn't know that was even possible.
- Here he comes!

363
00:41:22,945 --> 00:41:26,376
No one in the world
has ever gotten 100 before.

364
00:41:32,347 --> 00:41:35,481
A perfect score? Me?

365
00:41:35,581 --> 00:41:38,129
- This can't be right.
- No, Charlie Brown, look.

366
00:41:38,229 --> 00:41:40,796
You really do have a perfect score.

367
00:41:40,896 --> 00:41:43,250
I have heard peanut butter is brain food.

368
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:47,220
- Nice job, Chuck, old boy.
- I always knew you had it in you, Charles.

369
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:50,180
This can't be right! Out of my way!

370
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:54,077
Mr. Perfect, Charlie Brown?
It must be a typo!

371
00:41:54,177 --> 00:41:58,573
I don't believe it. I won't believe it!
I demand a recount!

372
00:41:58,673 --> 00:42:01,890
<i>Good afternoon, students and staff.
We have a special announcement.</i>

373
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:04,261
<i>There will be an all-school assembly
Monday morning</i>

374
00:42:04,361 --> 00:42:07,282
<i>to celebrate our illustrious classmate,
Charlie Brown,</i>

375
00:42:07,382 --> 00:42:10,417
<i>who achieved a perfect score
on the standardized test.</i>

376
00:42:10,617 --> 00:42:13,287
Make way. Genius coming through!

377
00:42:13,387 --> 00:42:16,224
I have a science project due next week.
Can you give me your thoughts?

378
00:42:16,324 --> 00:42:17,634
Hey, I saw him first!

379
00:42:17,734 --> 00:42:20,903
They say you're a genius.
Can you read my mind?

380
00:42:21,003 --> 00:42:23,916
- Hey, leave him alone!
- Yeah, leave him alone!

381
00:42:24,016 --> 00:42:28,887
Now, Charlie Brown, as far as the book
report goes, what would you suggest?

382
00:42:28,987 --> 00:42:31,915
Well, you can never go wrong
if you stick with the classics.

383
00:42:32,115 --> 00:42:35,142
A comic book? I thought classics
had to have hard covers.

384
00:42:35,442 --> 00:42:37,865
Boy, do we feel stupid now.

385
00:42:42,058 --> 00:42:45,211
Will you look at this.
What a contemporary piece.

386
00:42:45,311 --> 00:42:47,655
Notice his use of space.

387
00:42:47,755 --> 00:42:50,573
Have you all lost your minds?

388
00:42:57,664 --> 00:43:01,143
You have what is referred to
as an "irrational fear."

389
00:43:02,436 --> 00:43:04,756
Hey, kid! What do you think you're doing?

390
00:43:04,856 --> 00:43:07,491
Following in the footsteps of greatness.

391
00:43:07,591 --> 00:43:11,186
- Breakaway!
- Shoot it, Charlie Brown! Shoot it!

392
00:43:15,784 --> 00:43:17,819
Nice use of angles there, Charles.

393
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:20,969
All right, Charlie Brown!

394
00:43:21,069 --> 00:43:25,342
But how is Santa ever going to find
our house without lights?

395
00:43:29,297 --> 00:43:31,600
And this is where it all began.

396
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:34,727
As a youth, he passed many hours
just sitting in that chair,

397
00:43:34,827 --> 00:43:36,937
keeping his deep thoughts to himself.

398
00:43:37,037 --> 00:43:42,066
And here we have his early kites,
used in many aerodynamic studies.

399
00:43:42,409 --> 00:43:45,880
If we're lucky, we'll see him
in his natural habitat.

400
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:50,677
And this is his actual bed where he lies
and ponders life's greatest questions.

401
00:43:50,777 --> 00:43:54,539
- Hey! What are you doing?
- I'm cashing in on your celebrity.

402
00:44:00,202 --> 00:44:02,762
Can I have your autograph?

403
00:44:03,556 --> 00:44:05,916
And for show and tell today...

404
00:44:06,016 --> 00:44:07,920
my big brother!

405
00:44:23,101 --> 00:44:26,513
- I haven't seen you in a while.
- My whole life has changed, Linus.

406
00:44:26,613 --> 00:44:29,523
All of a sudden, everyone wants
to be my friend and yet,

407
00:44:29,623 --> 00:44:30,883
I haven't really changed.

408
00:44:30,983 --> 00:44:33,745
Do they like me for who I am,
or for who they think I am?

409
00:44:33,845 --> 00:44:36,364
There he is! Charlie Brown,
I need you on my chess team!

410
00:44:36,464 --> 00:44:38,849
He's got no time for meaningless games.
He's coming with me.

411
00:44:38,949 --> 00:44:39,906
Roll sound!

412
00:44:40,006 --> 00:44:42,144
- Speed.
- And, action!

413
00:44:42,244 --> 00:44:45,398
Do you have time to help me write
my book report? It's due on Monday.

414
00:44:45,498 --> 00:44:47,901
Monday? The report is due on Monday?

415
00:44:48,001 --> 00:44:50,928
She's back on Monday!
I haven't even started yet!

416
00:44:51,028 --> 00:44:55,367
- Does anyone know where Marcie is?
- She went skating with Peppermint Patty.

417
00:44:55,467 --> 00:44:59,995
Mr. Brown. Mr. Brown!
What about my exclusive?

418
00:45:00,095 --> 00:45:01,089
Cut.

419
00:45:01,489 --> 00:45:03,491
There's Huckleberry Finn...

420
00:45:03,791 --> 00:45:05,168
Catcher in the Rye.

421
00:45:05,268 --> 00:45:08,563
Sir, I've been sitting here for hours.

422
00:45:08,663 --> 00:45:12,525
These are the greatest books of all time.
Please just pick one!

423
00:45:13,064 --> 00:45:14,497
Let me sleep on it, Marcie.

424
00:45:14,597 --> 00:45:18,522
There's no time for sleeping, sir.
It's due Monday.

425
00:45:21,259 --> 00:45:25,814
Just my luck to get a partner that thinks
Moby Dick was a hockey player.

426
00:45:25,914 --> 00:45:29,024
Marcie? Where are you going?

427
00:45:30,418 --> 00:45:32,486
Hey, Chuck, old boy.

428
00:45:32,586 --> 00:45:35,998
- What brings you down here?
- I'm looking for Marcie.

429
00:45:38,867 --> 00:45:40,060
I need some advice.

430
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:43,849
Curveball not working for you?
Slap shot not strong enough?

431
00:45:44,649 --> 00:45:46,959
No, I'm good with all that.

432
00:45:47,059 --> 00:45:51,046
I need to talk to Marcie about finding
the greatest book of all time.

433
00:45:51,146 --> 00:45:53,841
I just might be able
to help you there, Chuck.

434
00:45:53,941 --> 00:45:57,345
Marcie just read up
a long list of great novels.

435
00:45:57,445 --> 00:45:59,997
Huckleberry-something, Catcher with a Pie.

436
00:46:00,097 --> 00:46:04,227
But, she said the greatest book
of all time

437
00:46:04,327 --> 00:46:06,521
is called Leo's Toy Store...

438
00:46:06,621 --> 00:46:11,108
by some old guy called Warren... Piece.

439
00:46:11,208 --> 00:46:14,111
- Leo's Toy Store.
- Yup. That's the one, Chuck.

440
00:46:14,211 --> 00:46:17,418
- Thanks for the tip.
- Love that hustle, Chuck!

441
00:46:22,010 --> 00:46:25,864
Does anyone know
where I can find Leo's Toy Store?

442
00:46:47,202 --> 00:46:49,396
Leo's Toy Store.

443
00:46:49,596 --> 00:46:50,498
Nope.

444
00:46:50,598 --> 00:46:54,075
No. No. No.

445
00:46:55,043 --> 00:46:57,086
Where is it?

446
00:46:59,632 --> 00:47:02,017
He's going into the grown-up's section.

447
00:47:02,117 --> 00:47:04,194
Is that legal?

448
00:47:08,616 --> 00:47:11,919
Charles? I've never seen you
in here before.

449
00:47:12,019 --> 00:47:14,506
Marcie, thank goodness I found you.

450
00:47:14,606 --> 00:47:17,133
Can you help me find
a copy of Leo's Toy Store?

451
00:47:17,233 --> 00:47:19,777
Did you say "Leo's Toy Store"?

452
00:47:19,877 --> 00:47:22,414
Yeah. Peppermint Patty told me
you said it was the greatest...

453
00:47:22,514 --> 00:47:26,087
Stop right there, Charles. Come with me.

454
00:47:26,534 --> 00:47:28,986
This is what you're looking for.

455
00:47:29,486 --> 00:47:31,847
Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace.

456
00:47:37,203 --> 00:47:39,855
Yikes. How long was this war?

457
00:47:39,955 --> 00:47:42,450
Are you sure that is the book
you want to read?

458
00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:46,339
Might I remind you, Charles, you only have
the weekend to complete your report.

459
00:47:46,679 --> 00:47:50,224
I have to if I'm going to win
that gold star.

460
00:47:53,794 --> 00:47:55,271
I'm okay.

461
00:48:05,532 --> 00:48:10,076
Big book. How are you gonna
get it home, smarty-pants?

462
00:48:19,311 --> 00:48:21,488
Pretty smart. What am I saying?

463
00:48:21,588 --> 00:48:24,150
Good ol' Charlie Brown.

464
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:27,310
Now there's a guy who's going places.

465
00:48:39,265 --> 00:48:40,483
Thanks.

466
00:48:49,842 --> 00:48:51,394
Surprise!

467
00:48:51,494 --> 00:48:54,915
- Happy Birthday!
- Who invited him?

468
00:49:11,364 --> 00:49:13,641
War and Peace. Page one.

469
00:49:13,741 --> 00:49:18,329
"Eh bien, mon prince, so Genoa..."

470
00:49:20,623 --> 00:49:23,226
Hey, Charlie Brown, come out and play!

471
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:27,480
Sorry, guys.

472
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:30,824
- Who reads a book on the weekend?
- Okay. Where was I?

473
00:49:30,924 --> 00:49:34,319
"Took a horse from a commander,
and hungry and weary..."

474
00:49:34,419 --> 00:49:37,913
"...and the musketry fire
sounded far away..."

475
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:44,915
"Prince Andrei mused
on the unimportance of greatness..."

476
00:49:45,015 --> 00:49:47,875
"...unimportance of life,
which no one could understand..."

477
00:49:47,975 --> 00:49:51,327
"...there was yesterday,
and there was the day before..."

478
00:49:54,799 --> 00:49:58,561
- Okay, show's over. Clear it out.
- Will there be a late show?

479
00:49:58,661 --> 00:50:02,073
"And to recognize a dependence
we do not feel."

480
00:50:02,173 --> 00:50:04,225
"The end."

481
00:50:04,825 --> 00:50:06,642
I did it.

482
00:50:18,248 --> 00:50:20,451
It's all coming together now.

483
00:50:22,543 --> 00:50:28,450
Okay. This is my book report
about War and Peace.

484
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:32,594
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

485
00:50:32,694 --> 00:50:36,599
First there was war. Then there was peace.

486
00:50:36,699 --> 00:50:41,678
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.

487
00:50:42,455 --> 00:50:46,150
Only 983 words to go.

488
00:50:52,615 --> 00:50:54,425
Rats!

489
00:50:59,289 --> 00:51:04,334
This is no use. I'm just not
as smart as they think I am.

490
00:51:10,942 --> 00:51:12,594
I can't let her down.

491
00:51:13,594 --> 00:51:16,940
There's still time. You can do this.

492
00:51:17,389 --> 00:51:19,841
You can't give up on her now.

493
00:51:27,233 --> 00:51:30,801
998, 999, 1000.

494
00:51:30,901 --> 00:51:32,795
Finished.

495
00:51:40,829 --> 00:51:42,948
Wake up, big brother!

496
00:51:43,048 --> 00:51:47,373
Today's the big assembly to celebrate
your perfect score. Come see!

497
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:50,407
What are you up to now?

498
00:51:50,507 --> 00:51:53,885
Now that you're a big celebrity,
we have to move fast.

499
00:51:53,985 --> 00:51:57,597
I have shirts, hats, mugs, and more.

500
00:51:57,697 --> 00:52:02,209
The fame that comes with intellectual
superiority can be very fleeting.

501
00:52:02,309 --> 00:52:05,296
You have to cash in while you can.

502
00:52:05,396 --> 00:52:09,934
Today is going to be
a big day for us, big brother.

503
00:52:14,439 --> 00:52:17,217
Thank you. Come again soon.

504
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:21,304
This is all for you, Charlie Brown.
You've really made it.

505
00:52:21,704 --> 00:52:23,098
It's going to happen.

506
00:52:23,198 --> 00:52:27,318
She's finally going to notice me
for doing something great.

507
00:52:27,718 --> 00:52:29,503
Charlie Brown.

508
00:52:29,603 --> 00:52:32,005
I hate to admit it, you blockhead...

509
00:52:32,105 --> 00:52:37,202
but public opinion leads me to believe,
that after all these years...

510
00:52:37,302 --> 00:52:39,806
I may have been wrong about you.

511
00:52:39,906 --> 00:52:41,416
This is not easy for me!

512
00:52:41,516 --> 00:52:44,619
My whole world has turned upside-down!

513
00:52:48,398 --> 00:52:52,387
Can I please have Charlie Brown
come to the stage?

514
00:53:00,367 --> 00:53:02,871
It is my pleasure to present to you today,

515
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:06,974
this award for the highest achievement
in this year's standardized testing.

516
00:53:07,074 --> 00:53:10,703
But before I do, the school proclamation.

517
00:53:11,203 --> 00:53:16,242
"On this day, whereas you have upheld
the highest of academic standards.

518
00:53:16,342 --> 00:53:20,722
"And whereas no one would have
ever expected that of you."

519
00:53:20,822 --> 00:53:25,334
"And whereas you are the first
to ever receive a perfect score."

520
00:53:25,434 --> 00:53:29,923
"Therefore, be it resolved that today
is declared Charlie Brown Day."

521
00:53:30,023 --> 00:53:32,806
"Signed, Miss Othmar."

522
00:53:43,494 --> 00:53:45,221
That's my big brother!

523
00:53:48,849 --> 00:53:52,820
How about that, Charlie Brown?
You're the star of the school now!

524
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:54,680
Congratulations, Charles.

525
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:58,087
Let me present you with your perfect test.

526
00:54:01,812 --> 00:54:05,083
<i>Oh, no. I must have signed
the wrong paper.</i>

527
00:54:25,744 --> 00:54:30,975
Before I begin, I'd like to thank
all of you for your support.

528
00:54:33,018 --> 00:54:34,695
You have all been so kind.

529
00:54:34,795 --> 00:54:38,300
It's not often that I get
this sort of recognition.

530
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:40,677
But...

531
00:54:41,877 --> 00:54:44,287
there's been a mistake.

532
00:54:46,891 --> 00:54:49,284
This is not my test.

533
00:54:51,078 --> 00:54:53,548
I knew it!

534
00:54:54,448 --> 00:54:56,338
Therefore...

535
00:54:56,999 --> 00:54:59,171
I cannot accept this honor.

536
00:54:59,271 --> 00:55:01,672
Can a brother and sister get a divorce?

537
00:55:02,072 --> 00:55:06,343
I think this belongs to Peppermint Patty.
She's the real genius.

538
00:55:25,679 --> 00:55:29,434
That was a very admirable thing
you just did, Charlie Brown.

539
00:55:30,434 --> 00:55:33,855
One moment I'm the hero,
the next I'm the goat.

540
00:55:33,955 --> 00:55:38,111
Maybe things will go your way again
after you hand in your book report.

541
00:55:38,568 --> 00:55:40,603
I'm not so sure.

542
00:55:40,703 --> 00:55:44,432
I was up all night working on it
and I can't remember a single word.

543
00:55:44,532 --> 00:55:47,334
Surely it's not as bad
as you think, Charlie Brown.

544
00:55:47,434 --> 00:55:49,853
Let me see what you wrote.

545
00:55:52,931 --> 00:55:57,907
Charlie Brown, the insight you bring to
such a complex novel is beyond reproach.

546
00:55:58,007 --> 00:56:02,150
You two are sure to win the gold star
with a book report of this quality.

547
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:06,454
Book report? Were we supposed
to do a book report?

548
00:56:06,554 --> 00:56:09,182
Hi. In light of the fact
that you were away,

549
00:56:09,282 --> 00:56:13,044
Charlie Brown took it upon himself to
complete the report for the both of you.

550
00:56:13,144 --> 00:56:18,242
And I must say, this is one of the finest
bits of literary analysis I have ever read.

551
00:56:33,139 --> 00:56:35,849
No, no, no!

552
00:56:39,838 --> 00:56:42,682
Oh, good grief.

553
00:56:44,317 --> 00:56:46,919
Maybe we can fix it?

554
00:56:54,601 --> 00:56:58,155
<i>Chapter 4. Curse you, Red Baron!</i>

555
01:00:06,493 --> 01:00:11,924
<i>The Flying Ace set out across
the hostile countryside undeterred.</i>

556
01:00:44,164 --> 01:00:49,078
Whenever I feel really alone,
I just sit and stare into the night sky.

557
01:00:49,578 --> 01:00:52,623
I've always thought that one
of those stars was my star...

558
01:00:52,823 --> 01:00:54,766
and at moments like this,

559
01:00:54,866 --> 01:00:57,988
I know that my star
will always be there for me.

560
01:00:58,088 --> 01:01:02,050
Like a comforting voice saying,
"Don't give up, kid."

561
01:01:06,996 --> 01:01:09,765
<i>The Flying Ace had to return
to the aerodrome</i>

562
01:01:09,865 --> 01:01:13,301
<i>if he was ever to rescue Fifi.</i>

563
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:37,493
Hey.

564
01:02:25,991 --> 01:02:30,098
<i>Christmas time is here</i>

565
01:02:30,555 --> 01:02:34,683
<i>Happiness and cheer</i>

566
01:02:40,715 --> 01:02:45,203
Yeah, Chuck, your crazy dog
is over here again.

567
01:03:23,174 --> 01:03:27,017
Excuse me, mister.
Have you ever flown a kite?

568
01:03:28,329 --> 01:03:32,233
Well, actually, let me just say that...

569
01:03:32,333 --> 01:03:35,070
I have years of experience
with kites, but I...

570
01:03:35,170 --> 01:03:36,545
That's great!

571
01:03:37,845 --> 01:03:42,526
Well, okay. The thing is,
flying a kite isn't for everyone.

572
01:03:42,626 --> 01:03:46,652
It takes a certain type of person.
It can be frustrating at times.

573
01:03:46,752 --> 01:03:50,850
They tend to have a mind of their own.
But with determination and dedication,

574
01:03:50,950 --> 01:03:53,053
- you can make it happen.
- Really?

575
01:03:53,153 --> 01:03:56,273
Here. You hold the string.
Plant your feet.

576
01:03:56,373 --> 01:04:00,595
Weight forward. Knees bent.
Back straight. Head up.

577
01:04:00,895 --> 01:04:03,797
And remember, keep it simple.

578
01:04:03,897 --> 01:04:07,534
- Okay.
- When I say "go," run as fast as you can.

579
01:04:07,634 --> 01:04:10,053
Which way, mister?

580
01:04:13,641 --> 01:04:16,468
That way. Now, go!

581
01:04:19,913 --> 01:04:22,867
I hope the little guy
doesn't get discouraged, Snoopy.

582
01:04:22,967 --> 01:04:25,385
He doesn't quite know
how difficult this will be.

583
01:04:25,485 --> 01:04:28,289
It may take him years
to gain my level of experience.

584
01:04:28,389 --> 01:04:30,909
It doesn't just happen over...

585
01:04:32,059 --> 01:04:33,286
It's flying!

586
01:04:35,396 --> 01:04:38,966
Thanks, mister. You sure know your kites.

587
01:04:39,066 --> 01:04:40,630
Do you want to try?

588
01:04:48,317 --> 01:04:51,196
You can do it! Don't give up!

589
01:04:53,948 --> 01:04:57,451
<i>Chapter 7. Never give up!</i>

590
01:04:59,045 --> 01:05:04,478
<i>The Flying Ace knew this would be the
last chance to save the love of his life.</i>

591
01:08:32,834 --> 01:08:36,920
<i>The Flying Ace returned to the aerodrome
with the love of his life.</i>

592
01:08:37,020 --> 01:08:39,614
<i>He returned a hero.</i>

593
01:08:45,997 --> 01:08:48,382
"And so, as our hero observed,"

594
01:08:48,482 --> 01:08:52,470
"he was destined to face
the infamous Red Baron another day."

595
01:08:52,570 --> 01:08:57,490
A dog that flies? This is
the dumbest thing I have ever read!

596
01:09:06,416 --> 01:09:09,138
I got dog germs!

597
01:09:14,259 --> 01:09:16,821
Come on, Charlie Brown!

598
01:09:16,921 --> 01:09:19,506
Today calls for something special.
Here we go.

599
01:09:21,808 --> 01:09:24,777
- Hey, guys.
- It's the last day of school!

600
01:09:25,077 --> 01:09:27,363
Well, big brother, can you believe it?

601
01:09:27,463 --> 01:09:32,201
No more reading, writing, arithmetic.
No more learning ever!

602
01:09:32,301 --> 01:09:35,555
What are you talking about?
This is just the start of summer vacation.

603
01:09:35,655 --> 01:09:37,731
You have eight more years
of grammar school.

604
01:09:37,831 --> 01:09:39,300
Four more years of high school.

605
01:09:39,450 --> 01:09:42,038
- Eight... Plus four.
- Plus four more years of college.

606
01:09:42,138 --> 01:09:45,190
Add the one to an extra four...

607
01:09:45,290 --> 01:09:48,400
That's over 37 years of school!

608
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:52,099
I'll be bald and wrinkly by then.

609
01:09:55,984 --> 01:09:57,534
Look at that!

610
01:09:57,634 --> 01:09:59,710
Is that Snoopy?

611
01:10:02,639 --> 01:10:04,491
Lucky.

612
01:10:08,562 --> 01:10:10,430
Okay, everyone, listen up.

613
01:10:10,530 --> 01:10:13,793
I know this is the last day of school...

614
01:10:14,243 --> 01:10:16,512
But first, before we leave,

615
01:10:16,612 --> 01:10:20,975
we need to finish picking our partners
for this year's summer pen-pal project.

616
01:10:21,075 --> 01:10:25,220
When I draw a name,
stand if you want to be their partner.

617
01:10:25,914 --> 01:10:28,983
Here we go. The next name is... Pigpen!

618
01:10:29,083 --> 01:10:32,820
I will. A little dirt never hurt anyone.

619
01:10:33,420 --> 01:10:36,089
- Schroeder.
- I do!

620
01:10:36,189 --> 01:10:39,058
I mean, I will.

621
01:10:40,412 --> 01:10:42,545
Charlie Brown.

622
01:10:44,833 --> 01:10:46,326
I will.

623
01:10:48,502 --> 01:10:50,324
<i>She will?</i>

624
01:10:56,643 --> 01:10:58,896
Summer time!

625
01:11:01,882 --> 01:11:03,650
Hi!

626
01:11:05,786 --> 01:11:09,815
Charlie Brown, where have you been?
It's the first day of summer.

627
01:11:09,915 --> 01:11:12,526
You should be down there
having fun with everyone else.

628
01:11:12,626 --> 01:11:15,079
I can't stop thinking about it, Linus.

629
01:11:15,179 --> 01:11:18,824
After all the humiliating disasters
she witnessed this year,

630
01:11:18,924 --> 01:11:22,494
why would she choose me?
Was she feeling sorry for me?

631
01:11:22,594 --> 01:11:26,241
I don't want her to choose me
just because she was feeling sorry for me.

632
01:11:26,341 --> 01:11:28,752
I have slightly more dignity than that.

633
01:11:28,852 --> 01:11:33,506
Charlie Brown, it might be time
to consider the wild possibility...

634
01:11:33,606 --> 01:11:37,185
that you're a good person
and that people like you.

635
01:11:37,285 --> 01:11:40,287
But, you know, you'll never
really know the answer, unless...

636
01:11:40,387 --> 01:11:44,579
I just go up and talk to her!
I should've listened to you all along!

637
01:12:06,848 --> 01:12:10,667
Oh! "Charles." I mean, "Charlie Brown."

638
01:12:10,767 --> 01:12:12,544
She's not here?

639
01:12:12,644 --> 01:12:16,800
On her way to summer camp?
So the bus hasn't left school yet?

640
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:18,976
But it's about to leave?

641
01:12:21,428 --> 01:12:24,465
And, by the way, it was a pleasure
to meet you, ma'am.

642
01:12:26,116 --> 01:12:28,302
Charlie Brown!

643
01:12:28,702 --> 01:12:30,967
You blockhead!

644
01:12:32,815 --> 01:12:34,666
All right!

645
01:13:19,895 --> 01:13:21,403
How do I get out of here?

646
01:13:31,383 --> 01:13:35,194
The whole world seems to be
conspiring against me.

647
01:13:36,687 --> 01:13:41,157
I'm just asking for a little help
for once in my life.

648
01:13:49,767 --> 01:13:52,429
Get out of here! Not you, too!

649
01:13:56,256 --> 01:13:58,225
Hey, look, it's Charlie Brown!

650
01:14:04,329 --> 01:14:06,817
Charlie Brown is flying a kite?

651
01:14:06,917 --> 01:14:09,837
Charlie Brown is flying a kite!

652
01:14:13,139 --> 01:14:15,956
- Chuck's got a kite in the air.
- Way to go, Charles!

653
01:14:19,207 --> 01:14:21,975
Charlie Brown is really doing it!
He's flying a kite!

654
01:14:44,572 --> 01:14:46,674
Oh, hi, Charlie Brown.

655
01:14:47,574 --> 01:14:51,029
- You remembered my name?
- Of course I did.

656
01:14:52,029 --> 01:14:56,117
Before you leave,
there's something I really need to know.

657
01:14:56,217 --> 01:14:59,939
Why, out of all the kids in our class...

658
01:15:00,039 --> 01:15:02,274
would you want to be partners with me?

659
01:15:03,273 --> 01:15:05,042
That's easy.

660
01:15:05,142 --> 01:15:07,905
Because I've seen
the type of person you are.

661
01:15:08,905 --> 01:15:11,700
An insecure, wishy-washy failure?

662
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:15,670
That's not who you are at all.

663
01:15:15,770 --> 01:15:19,606
I like the compassion you showed
for your sister at the talent show.

664
01:15:19,706 --> 01:15:22,109
The honesty you had at the assembly.

665
01:15:22,209 --> 01:15:25,947
And at the dance,
you were brave, and funny.

666
01:15:27,882 --> 01:15:29,543
And what you did for me...

667
01:15:29,643 --> 01:15:33,519
doing the book report while I was away,
was so sweet of you.

668
01:15:35,791 --> 01:15:39,336
So when I look at you,
I don't see a failure at all.

669
01:15:39,736 --> 01:15:42,765
You have all the qualities that I admire.

670
01:15:44,065 --> 01:15:47,051
Sorry, I have to go now.

671
01:15:48,702 --> 01:15:50,555
Wait.

672
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:52,927
I think this belongs to you.

673
01:15:53,407 --> 01:15:57,370
Thank you.
I've been looking everywhere for this!

674
01:16:00,790 --> 01:16:03,417
I'll write to you, pen-pal.

675
01:16:04,985 --> 01:16:06,836
Bye!

676
01:16:17,807 --> 01:16:19,867
Is he okay?

677
01:16:27,125 --> 01:16:30,941
It must feel pretty great being
Charlie Brown right about now.

678
01:16:31,441 --> 01:16:33,454
You did it.

679
01:16:34,381 --> 01:16:37,285
- Nice job, Chuck.
- Good job, Charles!

680
01:16:37,385 --> 01:16:39,461
Hey, big brother!

681
01:16:42,015 --> 01:16:44,979
I'm proud to be your little sister.

682
01:16:46,019 --> 01:16:48,095
Out of my way!

683
01:16:48,195 --> 01:16:51,658
I really need to tell you something,
you blockhead.

684
01:16:51,758 --> 01:16:54,177
You're still full of surprises.

685
01:16:54,277 --> 01:16:56,339
Good ol' Charlie Brown!

686
01:18:00,735 --> 01:18:02,686
Charlie Brown.

687
01:18:02,786 --> 01:18:07,008
Oh, Charlie Brown.
I'll hold the football and you kick it.

688
01:18:07,108 --> 01:18:10,352
You say you'll hold it, but what you
really mean is you'll pull it away,

689
01:18:10,452 --> 01:18:12,905
and I'll land on my back
and I'll kill myself.

690
01:18:13,005 --> 01:18:15,240
But I feel I have really come to know you.

691
01:18:15,340 --> 01:18:20,138
I now understand that you are kind,
compassionate, brave, and funny.

692
01:18:20,388 --> 01:18:24,576
No one would pull a football away
from a person with all those qualities.

693
01:18:24,876 --> 01:18:29,838
She's right. I would never pull the ball
away from someone with all those qualities.

694
01:18:29,938 --> 01:18:33,316
I'm gonna kick this ball
all the way to the moon.

695
01:18:39,506 --> 01:18:43,365
And gullible.
I forgot to mention "gullible."

696
01:19:34,904 --> 01:19:39,984
A round of root beers for our hero,
the Flying Ace!

696
01:19:40,305 --> 01:20:40,312
