—Hey, how are things looking over there?
—They look good to go.

3
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:36,690
What are you doing? You're falling behind schedule!

4
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,610
Listen here. We want results by the end of the week.

5
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,120
Y-Yes, sir!

6
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,910
Get a move on, all you!

7
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:49,620
Still, I wonder if we'll actually be able to find it.

8
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:54,130
Yes, sir. I cannot say we are making any headway.

9
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,460
Yes, however...

10
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,230
Brother, it's me. It's Mokuba.

11
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,480
Grandpa, I'm on my way.

12
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:19,030
Oh... W-Wait a second there, Yugi!

13
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,570
What is it?

14
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,660
Umm, well, you see...

15
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,410
Hey, I'm kind of in a hurry here.

16
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:28,120
Well... I've been noticing Anzu-chan hasn't been
coming by to walk with you to school lately.

17
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,120
Huh?

18
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,920
Well, you know. You two always
used to go to school together...

19
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:36,420
And here I thought it was something important...
That kind of stuff is out of style!

20
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,600
'Sup.

21
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:48,850
Yugi!

22
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,440
A good mornin' to you!

23
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:59,190
'M-Morning!

24
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:00,860
Sorry, were you waiting long?

25
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,110
Mm-mmm.

26
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,530
Thank goodness.

27
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,450
Crap! I'm gonna be late!

28
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,790
I'm gonna be late!!

29
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:11,870
Woah, woah, woah!

30
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,960
Here we go. And, a-heave-ho!

31
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,630
Oh, man... Yikes.

32
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,550
Sorry 'bout that!

33
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:22,550
D-Don't worry about it, Sanpei-jiisan!

34
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,390
Dammit, Jonouchi!

35
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,350
I-I'm really sorry!!

36
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,310
My, oh, my...

37
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,020
'Morning, Bakura-kun!

38
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,070
—Here's a lunch box for you!
—Eat these cookies, please.

39
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:42,570
Wait a—! Oh, good morning!

40
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:46,240
—Honda!
—Oh?

41
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,830
We're down to the last minute
before the gate closes!

42
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,490
Easy does it!

43
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,670
Here we go! Hold on tight!

44
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,340
You punks!!

45
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,510
Are you serious, Anzu?

46
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:09,010
So, you're gonna go study abroad
after you graduate after all?

47
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:15,270
I'm going to get out there on my own
and just wing it, you know?

48
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:19,860
Well, it's been your childhood dream
to perform in a musical, after all.

49
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,530
Wow, going abroad with all your
hopes and dreams in tow, huh?

50
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,360
I sure am envious.

51
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:30,530
Only thing I'll be doing is taking over my pop's
factory and slaving away day in, day out.

52
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:34,290
—Hm?
—Don't be silly, Honda

53
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:37,790
That right there is a great
job that'll help support...

54
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:40,960
...the glorious nation of Japan!

55
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:42,460
Why, I still haven't...

56
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,470
...got a damn thing lined
up for myself, y'know!!

57
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:47,470
I give... I give!!

58
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:48,970
Jonouchi?

59
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:52,220
What happened to all those reckless
dreams of you becoming a pro duelist?

60
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:56,640
Make no mistake, yours truly has
improved his dueling skills.

61
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:58,900
First, I'll win the neighborhood tournament!

62
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,810
More importantly, you know...

63
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,570
...you need to get your Duel Disk
that the teacher confiscated back.

64
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:07,490
I should go get my deck
back from them, too...

65
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,240
Yugi?

66
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:12,740
Why don't you let everyone
hear what your dream is?

67
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,660
Oh, mm-hmm...

68
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,920
I want to create a new kind of game
while helping out back at the shop.

69
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:25,840
Also, you know, there's this game
contest in Germany every year.

70
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,340
I was thinking it'd be great to win it!

71
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:32,180
Wow, that sounds interesting!

72
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,350
Okay, then!

73
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:39,100
When the game you make gets to be number
one in the world, let's all meet up and play it.

74
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,190
Now we're talking!

75
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,860
Uh-huh, let's do it!

76
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,020
Hold up, guys.

77
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,360
Don't you worry.

78
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:48,530
Knowing you, Yugi, you're bound to
make your dream come true!

79
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:49,570
Mm-hmm.

80
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,450
We'll do it, then. Count on it.

81
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,290
It's like I told you, man.

82
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,620
That's just not gonna do the—

83
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,040
Hey, now.

84
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:06,960
That guy...

85
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:08,380
Hey, what's up?

86
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:11,220
—No, I mean, it's just that guy.
—Huh?

87
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,890
That guy sitting all the way in
the back next to the window...

88
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:16,470
You know 'im?

89
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,390
Do I know him? He's...

90
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:20,890
Who was he again?

91
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,900
Oh, come on, guys.
Clearly, he's...

92
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,150
Um, let's see...

93
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:27,610
Oh, right! That's it!

94
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:30,490
Aigami. That's Aigami.

95
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,570
Aigami...

96
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,740
Oh, right.
That's Aigami, isn't it?

97
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,830
Aigami-kun...

98
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,750
Hey, the whole lot of you.

99
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:42,330
Take your seats.

100
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:54,850
Thank goodness you managed
to get your Duel Disk back.

101
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:57,600
Yeah! I need this bad boy!

102
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:59,350
Right, Yugi?

103
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,850
Mm-hmm.

104
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:04,350
Same goes for you and that.

105
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:06,940
That deck is really important to you, right?

106
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,030
Mm-hmm.

107
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,780
Or rather...

108
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:14,200
To my Other Self...

109
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,200
Yugi?

110
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,040
Oh, it's nothing.

111
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,210
Sorry.

112
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,460
Say, Yugi.

113
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:28,960
There's no need to force yourself into
erasing your memories of him, you know.

114
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:34,380
My Other Self...

115
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:41,640
During the Battle Ceremony...

116
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,640
The both of us, we...

117
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:55,910
He no longer resides in my mind...

118
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:08,920
And while I'm in no way
trying to forget about him...

119
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:20,010
We made our strides into different
worlds all of our own.

120
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,690
Hm? Is that...?

121
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,770
What's the matter?

122
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,940
Aigami...

123
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,950
Boy, are you ever adorable.

124
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:40,370
P-Please stop this.

125
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:42,290
Why, I'm not doing a thing.

126
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:48,380
Woah, upsy-daisy!

127
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:49,880
Ah, it's you!

128
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,170
Jonouchi...

129
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,880
What are you doing, Kudaragi!?

130
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:54,970
Tch...

131
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:58,470
Hey, meet us 12 o' clock tonight at the
abandoned building on 3rd Street.

132
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,390
If you don't show up, well, you know...

133
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,560
P-too! Outta the way!

134
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,900
H-Hey, Aigami!

135
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,560
What's wrong? Hey!

136
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:14,070
I'm just so relieved that I
got weak in the knees.

137
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,490
Aigami-kun!

138
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,740
Jonouchi-kun, Masaki-san...

139
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,000
And, you would be
Yugi Mutou-kun, right?

140
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,660
Oh... Uh-huh.

141
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,500
That aside, are you all right?

142
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:32,090
Mm-hmm, I'll be all right. Thank you.

143
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:36,420
Hold on. Those guys are a bunch of
notorious thugs around these parts.

144
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,680
If you're being blackmailed or
something, then let me...

145
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:43,100
No, really, I'll be fine.

146
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,270
That guy...

147
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:50,690
Do you remember when it was
he became our classmate?

148
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,940
Mm-mm, truth is, not really.

149
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,190
Neither do I...

150
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,110
Y'know...

151
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:05,990
We're going to be graduating soon, but I never want to lose any memories of any of my friends.

152
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:29,730
So, you showed up just like
I told you to, did'ja?

153
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:32,400
Aigami-kun!

154
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,980
Now then, we'll start with the ritual.

155
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,910
We're going to make you
world famous with this.

156
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,580
That's great, isn't it?
You should be thanking Kudaragi-san!

157
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,330
The theme this time around is "pain"!

158
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:04,850
W-What the hell are you laughin' about?

159
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,430
Y-You bastard!

160
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:10,390
Do I reside in your memories?

161
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,100
You're...

162
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:15,770
You're... Aigami, aren't you?

163
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:24,110
And who exactly do you think is allowing
even scum such as yourselves to exist?

164
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,580
W-What the hell is going on?

165
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:51,980
Who are all of you!?

166
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:56,060
W-What's the big idea!?

167
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:21,250
Aah! My body—!

168
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,340
K-Kudaragi-san!!

169
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,010
I-Impossible!
He's vanished!

170
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:23,360
I've awaited you, Yugi!

171
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,700
Today will be the day
I settle the scores with you.

172
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:31,700
Hmph, are you up to the
task of defeating me, Kaiba?

173
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:35,750
It was not easy getting you here in front of me...

174
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,710
...after you went into hiding without
a trace and took victory with you.

175
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,710
But now, I finally have you!

176
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:47,550
And the embodiment of my tenacity
being this new Duel Disk of mine!

177
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:52,390
Here I come, Yugi!

178
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,680
Lay your entire soul as a duelist on the line!

179
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,900
And give me your best shot!

180
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,570
—Duel!
—Duel!!

181
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,900
It's my turn!

182
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,070
Draw!

183
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:14,740
Hmph.

184
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:22,420
Feast your eyes on the mightiest of all
dragons in all of its evolved glory!

185
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:25,750
Fusion Summon!!

186
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,590
Now, come forth!

187
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:38,100
Neo Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon!!

188
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,940
Now, make your move.

189
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:45,940
It's my turn!
Draw!

190
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:50,280
I activate the Magic Card,
Black Magic Veil!!

191
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,280
Using my Life Points as fodder...

192
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,950
Come forth, Black Magician!!

193
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:06,420
Next, I'll use Thousand Knives
to destroy your monster!

194
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:08,460
Not on my watch!

195
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,630
Trap, activate!
Dark Sacrifice!!

196
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:15,300
I send a Monster Card from my deck into the Cemetery!

197
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:17,970
This will negate the effects of your card!

198
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:21,480
Not bad, Kaiba.

199
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:23,140
Enough prattle.

200
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,820
Neo Ultimate Dragon is capable
of attacking three times.

201
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,650
I'll start with your Black Magician!

202
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,990
And that leaves you defenseless.

203
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,700
Next up is...

204
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,840
Trap Card,
Time Chain!

205
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:51,300
It negates the destruction of a monster via
an attack, and, in addition to that...

206
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,680
...it forces both of our monsters
into silence for the next two turns.

207
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:00,680
Meaning that they are as good as
not existing on the field at all, eh?

208
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:04,190
Here goes, Kaiba.

209
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,860
Come, Elf Sacred Swordsman,
Elf Swordsman!

210
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,650
Yugi...

211
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:16,360
Your moves always go well beyond
your opponent's expectations...

212
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,160
Your strategies employ instantaneous
analysis of their tactics during battle,

213
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:22,620
allowing you to read what's
up their sleeve and beyond.

214
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,370
Even faced with absolutely unfavorable odds,

215
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:29,040
you have come out victorious in numerous battles,
even cracking a smile all the while,

216
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:33,880
and while you assume that you've
subjected me to disgrace as well...

217
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:38,050
Behold.
Our battle is going to evolve.

218
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:47,270
This time, for sure,

219
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,400
I will pummel you into the dirt!

220
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:54,940
Kaiba, this turn, my Black Magician

221
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:57,910
regains it's power!

222
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:00,830
And then, I activate Dimension Magic!!

223
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,750
Elf Sacred Swordsman!
Lend me your strength!

224
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:10,630
Come forth, Black Magician Girl!

225
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:17,720
It will also destroy your monster!

226
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:23,720
Now, go!
Double Magicians' Attack!!

227
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:27,770
Quit messing around!

228
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,440
Be free,

229
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,940
Neo Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon!!

230
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:38,200
Yugi, you are well aware, aren't you?

231
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:43,120
Aware that this turn will be your last, that is!

232
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:48,460
This is the end, Yugi!

233
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,250
I wonder about that.

234
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:57,630
I use the power of both of my monsters...

235
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,390
...to summon the Trap Monster,
Dimension Reflector.

236
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:06,270
And, it's attack power is identical
to that of your monster.

237
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,940
In addition, it will deal damage to you

238
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:12,150
equal to that monster's attack power!

239
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,190
Damn you...

240
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,780
I've won, Kaiba!

241
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:32,500
Trap Card,
Enhanced Counter.

242
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:34,380
It negates the damage

243
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:39,170
and increases the attack power of my
monster equal to the damage amount.

244
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:42,010
Kaiba...

245
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:45,970
So, nothing more than a miserable clown
wrought from my memories after all, are you?

246
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,470
Be gone, Yugi!

247
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:53,350
Hyper Ultimate Burst!!

248
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,720
Well done, Kaiba-sama.

249
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,840
The results are above our expectations, sir!

250
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:28,510
Indeed, the new Duel Links
Solid Vision System is

251
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,560
capable of duels far and away
greater than anything played before.

252
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,520
With the cards serving as your
deck not actually existing,

253
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:44,360
the data for every card in the world is transmitted
into all Disks via the Crystal Cloud Network,

254
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:48,030
with quantum information linking
with one's cerebral memory banks...

255
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,990
turning any and all dueling data

256
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,500
into neuro-images which then
visualize themselves into any free space.

257
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:58,500
By analyzing my extensive memory data on him
and linking it with my cerebral nerves...

258
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,470
...I was successful in perfectly
materializing Yugi Mutou.

259
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:04,880
Quite perfect indeed, sir.

260
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:06,720
The experiment is an outstanding success!

261
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:09,760
—This will help the new model of Duel...
—Preposterous.

262
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:14,440
While it's true that in terms of
deck construction, strategic characteristics,

263
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:20,110
and even his penchant for getting
under others' skin, he was indeed a living copy...

264
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:21,990
However...

265
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:25,490
However, he was nothing more than an
image produced by my memories.

266
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:30,290
What point is there in victory over
some vision from my past!?

267
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:34,120
Hurry with the preparations for the
announcement of this new model of Duel Disk...

268
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,790
—...just as scheduled.
—Y-Yes, sir!

269
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,460
Yes... To resurrect him, I will have to...

270
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,300
Brother! Brother!

271
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:46,220
Brother, we've found it!

272
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,550
We've found it!

273
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:04,650
Thank you!

274
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:05,820
May I help you?

275
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,280
That's Jonouchi's, isn't it?

276
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:10,950
There's no fixing that
beat-up old Disk, is there?

277
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,660
You said it.

278
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:15,290
He's so damn reckless with his stuff.

279
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,620
Say, what have you been
looking at this whole time?

280
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:20,960
Huh? Oh...
Well, it's this article, you see...

281
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:24,510
Hey, those are the guys
from the other day...

282
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:27,090
It says that all of them
have gone missing.

283
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:29,840
—No word from any of them?
—Mm-hmm.

284
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:34,310
Plus, there have incidents similar to this
happening all over the world as of late.

285
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,180
I checked it out on the net myself.

286
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:39,810
Said something about over fifty
people all disappearing at once.

287
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,520
Oh, come on.

288
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:43,190
Welp, enjoy, guys!

289
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:44,980
Scary stuff.

290
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:47,650
Oh, speaking of which, recently...

291
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:51,200
I've been feeling like I'm
getting trailed myself, you know.

292
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:54,830
You sure that's not just from
the girls from the Bakura fan club?

293
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:57,370
—Look there.
—Huh?

294
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,380
Must be tough being
such a popular guy.

295
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:08,720
Attention, Domino City, no...

296
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,550
...Duelists around the world!

297
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:17,730
The Kaiba Corporation has successfully developed
the latest, next generation Duel Disk.

298
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:21,980
In a few days, all will become clear.

299
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,900
The latest Duel Disk!?

300
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,190
Kaiba-kun...

301
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,910
No way...

302
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:34,580
So, that's just going to make all the
Duel Disks up till now obsolete, then?

303
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:38,410
That just means you're going to have to
hustle even harder for this side-job of yours.

304
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:48,550
Aah! My Duel Disk is broken!

305
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:49,760
H-Huh!?

306
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:53,090
You're the one who broke it, right!?
Well, pay up!

307
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,930
I-I'm the one who fixed it for you, jerk!

308
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,720
C'mon, buy me the latest
model of Duel Disk instead!

309
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:02,100
—Oh, come on, quit it, you two.
—Latest model, latest model!

310
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,940
H-Hey!

311
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:08,440
You bastard!

312
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:13,950
Why, you...

313
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,620
What are you doing!?

314
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,580
Jounouchi...
You're fired!!

315
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:23,580
Aww! I beg you, don't fire me!!

316
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:35,640
When all seven of the lost
items are assembled,

317
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:38,930
the Pharaoh will travel to the netherworld.

318
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:43,480
Even souls of the wicked shall revert to light

319
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:46,940
and the gateway of a new
dimension shall be open.

320
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:52,990
Eventually, the new world
rendered in the light of order

321
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:57,990
shall be ushered in by
the souls of a higher plane.

322
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,000
Shin-sama...

323
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:06,000
I mustn't. I mustn't.
I mustn't harbor feelings of hate.

324
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:10,000
However, I can never forgive
him for what he's done.

325
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:12,010
I mustn't. I mustn't go.

326
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:14,470
However, I can never forget what he's done.

327
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,430
These are emotions unnecessary
to go to the new world.

328
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,350
I can never forgive him.

329
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,140
Diva...

330
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:26,850
The energy wave of your hatred is causing
your own wavelength to drop,

331
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:29,020
throwing off the harmony
of everyone else as well.

332
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:35,030
That energy wave will soon come to split
off our synchronous energy wave pattern.

333
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,200
I know that.

334
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:41,700
We must abandon this world just as
Shin-sama has told us...

335
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:44,870
...and go to a new world of a higher plane.

336
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:52,710
I know that.
Yes, I know that!

337
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:58,220
Still.. Still, that guy is in Japan...

338
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:00,180
...in Domino City...

339
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,560
...That is where he is!

340
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,520
You mustn't go, Diva!

341
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:24,700
Diva... Diva...

342
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:26,410
Diva.

343
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,420
I wish you would reconsider this.

344
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:32,420
I am certain that revenge is
something he would never ask for.

345
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:38,550
Every waking hour, I have never forgotten
what Shin-sama used to say to us.

346
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,260
In that case, why are you enacting revenge?

347
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:44,770
This is not revenge.

348
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:48,940
I am merely splitting off something
evil which threatens our world.

349
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:55,070
And what about you, Mani?

350
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:57,610
After what he did to Shin-sama?

351
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,950
Diva...

352
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,790
Diva, he's making his move.

353
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,850
He has made his arrival!

354
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:32,730
Brother!

355
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:35,440
We have been awaiting you, Seto-sama!

356
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:38,900
Have all of the pieces been assembled?

357
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:40,740
Y-Yes, sir.

358
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,410
So, this is it...

359
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:54,380
This is where the spirit of the Pharaoh
had his final bout with Yugi Mutou,

360
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,630
before leaving the mortal plane.

361
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,430
Until you made your
arrival here, Seto-sama,

362
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:03,890
we have been using this
electromagnetic security system

363
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:09,270
to keep complete guard so that not
a single person lays a finger on it.

364
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:12,100
Thirteen accelerated lasers keep
a perimeter around the puzzle...

365
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,270
I will be reconstructing the Puzzle.

366
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,110
—Get it to the copter on the double!
—Y-Yes, sir!

367
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:19,240
But, Brother?

368
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,450
They say it took Yugi eight years
to complete the Puzzle the first time.

369
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:26,330
A result of his child-like intellect, no less.

370
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:27,160
Isono!

371
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:31,620
Y-Yes, sir! Please just give me thirteen
minutes until the lock deactivates!

372
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,830
In that case, I suppose that gives me just
enough time to kill some of my boredom.

373
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,130
Why don't you spare us all the
trouble and show yourself?

374
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:42,510
Or, do you intend on hiding
yourself in the shadows forever?

375
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:43,970
Diva!

376
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:47,260
No, the one who calls himself Aigami!

377
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,640
Well, this is a surprise.

378
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:57,940
To think that you've even
figured out my real name as well,

379
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,610
Seto Kaiba!

380
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:04,820
Bastard... according to the
data logs, you were

381
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,820
in Domino City three minutes
and twelve seconds ago.

382
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:11,290
Kaiba Corporation, the company
which rules over Domino City...

383
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:16,210
To think that you cannot even register as a resident
unless you also register your dueling deck...

384
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:19,500
You are indeed one mad dictator.

385
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,510
W-Who are these guys?

386
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,180
Considering that you to go through
the trouble of coming here,

387
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:27,010
I can only imagine you're here for one thing...

388
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:28,970
And, so what, if we are?

389
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:32,350
Do you plan on getting rid of me?

390
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,520
Woah there, kid.
That's enough fun and games.

391
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:39,520
Oh, no. I'm done for...

392
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:41,650
Just kidding.

393
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:43,190
Bastard!

394
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:47,660
I simply despise such dangerous things
which cause harm to others, see.

395
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:53,160
It's my desire to erase all such
things from the face of this dimension.

396
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:57,370
Who the hell are all you?
Where'd you all come from?

397
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:03,050
W-What is this!?

398
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:05,260
T-That's impossible!

399
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:08,390
Kaiba, being the man you are,
I'm sure you understand.

400
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:10,850
What they call "the collective human consciousness"?

401
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:16,850
The collective human consciousness ensures
that all happenings in the world...

402
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:20,400
...are unconsciously determined
via a neurological network.

403
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:25,900
In short, the fact that you rule
in Domino City as a dictator,

404
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,610
is something that the
inhabitants of the city, and even...

405
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:32,410
...the people of the world have determined
via their collective consciousness.

406
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:36,580
You are simply being allowed to
play the part of conqueror.

407
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:40,170
All for the equilibrium of a
distorted and foolish world

408
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:43,550
whose creation was made possible
by the synchronization of all humans.

409
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,260
That dangerous thing which
just disappeared

410
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:50,510
has moved to a dimension with a
minutely different energy wave pattern

411
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,180
via the collective consciousness of our allies
gathered from all over the world.

412
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:58,640
To a dimension which is visible to
neither of us yet exists here.

413
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:01,770
Brother, the missing person's reports
happening all over the world,

414
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,150
you don't think that they're the ones...

415
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:09,280
We are a new entity that has appeared
in this physical dimension, Prana.

416
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:12,280
Our consciousness energy wave,
Prana's Mind...

417
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:15,370
is approximately seven times more powerful
than that of any conventional human.

418
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:18,290
And will soon reach the amount
of people necessary to

419
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:21,420
change the landscape of this world.

420
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:27,130
Now, be gone to a lesser dimension.

421
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,340
Ah... Brother!

422
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:34,100
Don't falter, Mokuba!

423
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:39,020
Behold!!

424
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,110
What is this...?

425
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,030
Kaiba!
Why is he not disappearing?

426
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:50,990
Don't tell me it's his Duel Disk...

427
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:56,990
It has amplified his ego
and deflected our powers?

428
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,080
Whoever the lot of you may be,

429
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:04,880
did you really think such tawdry
power would work against me?

430
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:08,340
You're every bit of the man
that the rumors state.

431
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:12,300
In which case, I will just have to pass judgment
on you using the cards of arcane magic!

432
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,800
Oh-ho... You, duel me?

433
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:20,270
I cannot just hand over the
Millennium Puzzle which you

434
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,980
have tarnished these sacred
grounds in order to unearth.

435
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:27,190
Interesting.
Then, allow me to make you regret

436
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,610
ever challenging me to a duel!

437
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,360
Regret? Hah.

438
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:33,910
Kaiba, I will invite you into our domain.

439
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:37,030
Into a dimensional domain duel, that is.

440
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:41,710
This field is now being transferred
to a place between dimensions.

441
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,370
W-What is this?

442
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,210
—Mokuba-sama. Look above.
—Huh?

443
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:51,260
Diva, do not let down your guard.

444
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:54,220
Not against this Kaiba and his power...

445
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,310
—Duel!!
—Duel!!

446
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:03,020
My turn. Draw!

447
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:05,980
What?

448
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:09,730
I'm able to summon high-level
monsters without paying any cost?

449
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:13,070
Our dueling allows us, in lieu of Normal Summoning...

450
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:16,280
...to Dimension Summon monsters,
regardless of their levels.

451
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:20,410
And then, you determine a value and battle

452
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,000
within the bounds of
that monster's Status.

453
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:24,250
Determine its Status, you say?

454
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:25,500
Indeed.

455
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:29,750
However, how much you're able to increase
its value depends on your willpower.

456
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:33,840
Hmph, if you mean to tell me
that this is your domain,

457
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:37,300
then allow me to do you the
discourtesy of treading without care!

458
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:39,050
Dimension Summon!!

459
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:50,270
Come forth, Krystal Dragon!

460
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:55,110
Come, it's your turn.

461
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:59,620
To think that you would draw out your
monster's attack power to the limits...

462
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:03,000
However, in this duel, in lieu of battle damage,

463
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:07,000
you will receive damage equal to the Status
of the destroyed monster!

464
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,290
Learn well.

465
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,500
Dimension Summon!!

466
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:16,010
Allow me to show you.
The monster that will send you to a lesser dimension!

467
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:22,390
Appear now! Vijam the Cubic Seed!

468
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:28,730
An attack power of 0?

469
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,190
You will know soon enough.
Very soon.

470
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,570
Hmph, very well.

471
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:39,240
As per your wishes,
I will blow you clean away!

472
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:43,950
Come forth!
One more Krystal Dragon!

473
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:46,750
Sick him!

474
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,500
First, make his monster no more!

475
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,420
What's this?

476
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:00,840
My monster vanished into a dimension
which you cannot attack it.

477
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:01,930
Also, look there.

478
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,760
What's this!?

479
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:06,930
The monster which battles with Vijam can neither

480
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:08,600
use its effects nor attack.

481
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:11,860
In other words, it has been un-dimensionalized!

482
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:14,690
What a shrewd trick.

483
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:19,530
But, I have yet another Krystal Dragon!

484
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,370
Trap, activate.

485
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:23,740
Cubic Ascension!

486
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,040
By calling forth yet another Vijam,

487
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:29,160
it will force you to conduct battle.

488
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:34,920
That leaves yet another monster left un-dimensionalized.

489
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:36,710
Miserable fool...

490
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,930
Trap, activate!
Dragon's Orb!!

491
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:43,550
At this moment, my Kyrstal Dragons' effects return!

492
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,640
By the both of them
having conducted battle,

493
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,310
it allows me to add two Blue-Eyes
from my deck into my hand!

494
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:52,770
And then, by these dragons' souls,

495
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:56,980
I will usher in a new servant of mine!

496
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:03,450
Come forth! Blue-Eyes Alternative White Dragon!!

497
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,580
Now, burn him to ashes!

498
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:14,920
Burn Stream of Destruction!!

499
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:24,340
Impressive, Kaiba.

500
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:29,140
However, I had already activated
the Trap card, Cubic Rebirth.

501
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:31,640
Your attack, as a result, did not connect.

502
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:35,360
In addition, it has let me summon
forth my third Vijam.

503
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:40,030
In exchange, I will do you a favor and summon
the remaining Blue-Eyes in your hand.

504
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:45,450
Which leads to all of your
Blue-Eyes being un-dimensionalized.

505
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:59,590
Kaiba, your taste of the true
terror of my Cubic Monsters...

506
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:01,510
...starts here!

507
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:04,800
Dimension Special Summon!!

508
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:11,480
Show yourself before me,
Dark Garnex the Cubic Beast!!

509
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:18,520
His monster transformed!?

510
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:20,820
Cubic Beast monsters

511
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:25,450
increase their attack power by
integrating Vijams with it.

512
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:29,410
Now, shatter!

513
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:35,670
And, there's more!

514
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:38,630
When a Cubic Beast destroys a monster via battle,

515
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:43,010
it will repeat the process of
separating and combining to change form!

516
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:47,680
Plus, it increases its attack equal to the
amount of Vijams integrated with it,

517
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,510
adding to its amount of
allowed attacks as well!

518
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:53,430
Once again, Dimension Special Summon!

519
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:58,440
Come forth!
Blade Garoodia the Cubic Beast!

520
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:05,780
Now, take these back-to-back attacks!

521
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:17,250
The attack power of your
destroyed monsters was zero.

522
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:21,000
As a result, no battle damage was incurred.

523
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:24,260
But, not this time!

524
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:29,340
I use my three Vijams to perform
a Dimension Special Summon!!

525
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:35,730
Descend forth,
Buster Gundil the Cubic Behemoth!!

526
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:39,400
Are you prepared, Kaiba?

527
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:43,190
First thing's first,
eliminate his dragons!!

528
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:01,210
Brother!!

529
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,380
I still have an attack left.

530
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,090
Kaiba, this is the end!

531
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:16,890
Trap, activate!

532
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:18,890
Counter Gate!!

533
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:20,350
What?

534
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:25,150
It negates your attack
letting me draw a card.

535
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:27,900
If I draw a Monster Card,

536
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:29,910
I'm allowed to Special Summon it.

537
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:32,240
Such futile resistance!

538
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:34,120
Trap, activate!

539
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,660
Cubic Mandala!!

540
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:40,540
I'll just be returning your un-dimensionalized
dragons in the Cemetery back to you.

541
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:43,880
This will prevent you from
summoning any more monsters.

542
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,800
In addition, as long as they remain there,

543
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:50,430
you will be unable to activate
any Monster Effect.

544
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,390
Oh, no...

545
00:39:57,930 --> 00:39:59,600
No...

546
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:04,730
In no way is defeat a permissible
option in this place.

547
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:09,320
The one who should have put the nail in Yugi's—
no, in Atem's coffin...

548
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,240
...was none other than me.

549
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:13,990
And, in my subconscious, having failed that task,

550
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:17,240
his ghost continues to wander around, even to this date.

551
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:19,160
Yugi...

552
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:30,130
What in the world!?

553
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:35,640
Draw!!

554
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,060
W-What...
What is going on here?

555
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,670
The God of Obelisk!?

556
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:12,380
That card was supposed to be lost under the ground of
the Mortuary Temple in the Battle Ceremony!

557
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,340
Inconceivable!

558
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:20,850
The Pharaoh's memories, the remnant
consciousness of this sacred domain...

559
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:24,350
Are you saying that Kaiba...
that he managed to read them!?

560
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:28,190
And, not only that, but those of Obelisk, the
one time servant of the Pharaoh!

561
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,860
Yugi...

562
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:33,450
I activate Obelisk's effect!

563
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,320
I will destroy my own monsters

564
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:39,370
to inflict damage equal
to Obelisk's attack power

565
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:42,080
and inflict it straight to you!

566
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:45,080
Impossible!
Monster Effects are negated!

567
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:47,210
This is no monster!

568
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,210
It's a God!!

569
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:56,840
God Hand Impact!!

570
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:12,780
He did it!

571
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:19,820
Kaiba...

572
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:25,460
—The duel isn't over yet!
—Brother!

573
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:29,960
—Everything's all set!
—Take 'er up!

574
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:33,460
The Millennium Puzzle, it's...!

575
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,550
Later!!

576
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,600
Why, you...!

577
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:57,450
Aigami!

578
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:00,320
Our match is postponed.

579
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:20,220
Kaiba...

580
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:36,780
T-This couldn't be...!

581
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:48,580
Hm... Huh? Wha?

582
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:53,590
W-What the hell's this!?

583
00:43:58,550 --> 00:44:00,300
K-Kaiba!

584
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:04,220
Ah, you!
And that Duel Disk!!

585
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:06,930
Do you want it?

586
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:09,430
Jonouchi, do you want this!?

587
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:13,440
Dammit!! I don't want...

588
00:44:14,770 --> 00:44:19,650
...that crap!!

589
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:26,280
W-Wha?

590
00:44:26,450 --> 00:44:27,290
Huh? But, this is...

591
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:30,250
What d'you think you're doin', Jonouchi!?

592
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:34,460
For three years, all of us have done
much in the school to...

593
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:38,920
Geez, graduation practice
is a some lame stuff!

594
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:41,130
Come on, get serious!

595
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:44,510
Oh, lay off. Right, Honda?

596
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,470
Jonouchi!

597
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:55,480
Diva... Diva...

598
00:44:55,690 --> 00:44:56,820
Diva!

599
00:44:58,690 --> 00:44:59,820
Sera...

600
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:02,700
You fought with Kaiba, didn't you?

601
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:06,830
Yeah, the Millennium Puzzle
is in his clutches.

602
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:11,000
If it should ever be put together...

603
00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:14,330
The Pharaoh will revive.

604
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:18,340
And, if that should happen,
we'll never carry out Shin-sama's prophecy,

605
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:22,090
and we will find ourselves
bound to this dimension.

606
00:45:22,510 --> 00:45:23,840
Diva...

607
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:27,680
That's why I'm telling you to give up
on this selfish sense of vengeance now.

608
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:31,350
As for the revival of the Pharaoh,
all we need to do is eliminate the vessel.

609
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:32,850
No, Big Brother!

610
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:35,770
I have a terrible feeling about this.

611
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:38,940
Something that could be irreversible...

612
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:49,740
Big Brother, please believe.

613
00:45:49,870 --> 00:45:53,960
There are those in this world, as well,
who will be on your side.

614
00:45:54,370 --> 00:45:56,040
On my side...?

615
00:45:57,210 --> 00:46:00,040
Phew!
All done. All done.

616
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:03,090
Say, all of us should
cut loose somewhere!

617
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:06,550
Yugi-kun!

618
00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:17,230
Awright!

619
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,270
Awright!

620
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:20,230
Incredible!

621
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,690
Lookie here, Aigami. Take a gander!

622
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:26,320
Woah! It's Red-Eyes!

623
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:28,910
This deck is my very soul!

624
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:32,240
You must really love
dueling yourself, huh, Aigami?

625
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:34,580
Mm-hmm, but I stink at it.

626
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:36,580
Yugi-kun is tough, you know.

627
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:39,750
Yeah, after all, he's the one who beat Kaiba.

628
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:42,250
Wow, that sure is something!

629
00:46:43,210 --> 00:46:46,090
I got it. Aigami-kun, why not challenge him?

630
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:49,220
Whaa? Me and Yugi-kun?

631
00:46:49,930 --> 00:46:52,100
Oh, come on, don't say "challenge."

632
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:54,430
Oh, but, if it's okay by you,

633
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:56,940
I would like to give dueling you a try.

634
00:46:57,270 --> 00:46:59,940
Woah there, if you're going to
challenge Yugi,

635
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:02,940
you're gonna have to
get past yours truly first!

636
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:07,610
Then, this Sunday, let's have a
dueling tournament at my house.

637
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:09,450
Oh, I like the sound of that!

638
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:11,950
I won't be losing, Yugi!

639
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:13,280
Maybe I should tag along, then!

640
00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:32,510
Elevator on standby at ground launch point.

641
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:36,270
Earthport track angle,
west longitude 90 degrees, plus minus zero.

642
00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:40,100
Gravitational field is stabilized.
Systems, all green. Check.

643
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:43,480
Level 3, track pipe security. Check.

644
00:47:43,650 --> 00:47:46,860
Everything is set, Kaiba-sama.

645
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:51,660
Isono, as a demonstration with our
latest Duel Disk's announcement,

646
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:55,830
we will be having a dueling
competition at Kaiba Land.

647
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:57,660
Yes, sir!

648
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:01,000
All of you, I want preparations
for that on the double.

649
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:57,430
I have been awaiting you, Mr. Kaiba.

650
00:48:57,970 --> 00:49:00,350
I have already prepared the equipment.

651
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:01,940
Proceed immediately.

652
00:49:02,310 --> 00:49:03,560
Very well, sir.

653
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:12,900
This equipment is capable of analyzing
the Puzzle's parts via 3D laser scanner,

654
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:20,950
and running simulations of combining each individual
part in 100,000 possible ways in the span 0.1 seconds.

655
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:23,460
Because such complex scanning is necessary,

656
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:26,420
it will not function under the
influence of gravity.

657
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:30,630
However, you have found a brilliant
solution to that problem, sir.

658
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:35,470
By utilizing the vacuum of space and scanning
the Puzzle's parts in a zero-gravity environment,

659
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:40,310
we are able to perfectly simulate rebuilding it,
from any angle we so desire.

660
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:44,230
By my calculations, the Puzzle will
be complete within six hours.

661
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:47,270
You have done it again, Mr. Kaiba.

662
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,020
Spare me the trite compliments.

663
00:49:49,230 --> 00:49:51,480
A thousand apologies, sir.

664
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,990
Just you wait,

665
00:49:57,870 --> 00:49:59,580
Yugi...

666
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,960
I really have been looking
forward towards today.

667
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:08,790
I can't believe I get to visit Yugi-kun's house.

668
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:11,420
I wonder if my deck will be good enough.

669
00:50:11,590 --> 00:50:13,880
Hey, Aigami?
What's that thing?

670
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:17,510
This? I guess it's like a deck case.

671
00:50:17,930 --> 00:50:20,350
"Property of Jonouchi" "Latest model"
Uh-huh... Pretty uncommon look for one.

672
00:50:20,810 --> 00:50:22,520
Is it an antique or something?

673
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:24,980
Mm-hmm... Straight from Egypt.

674
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:28,190
I received it from
someone very dear to me.

675
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:30,190
That makes sense.

676
00:50:30,310 --> 00:50:32,820
My dad is an antique salesman, you see,

677
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:35,400
and he's traveled all over
the world a lot of times,

678
00:50:36,070 --> 00:50:39,490
so I was in Egypt before I
transferred to my current school.

679
00:50:39,910 --> 00:50:42,450
Egypt, huh? Wow.

680
00:50:42,910 --> 00:50:45,580
I sure would like to hear that story...

681
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:49,790
Okay, look after the shop, now!

682
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:52,630
Hmm...

683
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:56,340
Yeah, I just can't keep this card out.

684
00:50:56,670 --> 00:50:59,930
I wonder what kind of deck Aigami-kun uses.

685
00:51:00,050 --> 00:51:02,180
It's so pretty...

686
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:07,310
So very pretty.
That golden box...

687
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:11,650
W-Welcome to the shop.
Oh, you mean this?

688
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:17,990
Sorry. This isn't for sale.

689
00:51:18,490 --> 00:51:22,910
This is my treasure and, right now, I'm
storing my really important cards in it...

690
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:28,870
...and those cards are also the cards beloved by
the Pharaoh that resided within your heart.

691
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:30,250
Huh?

692
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:34,210
Long ago, there was a monk to served the Pharaoh.

693
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:37,340
His name was Shadi.

694
00:51:37,470 --> 00:51:39,550
Shadi Shin.

695
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:46,890
That person's mission was to collect all seven
Millennium Items to the Tablet of the Pharaoh's Memories,

696
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:50,520
and send off his spirit to the netherworld.

697
00:51:50,850 --> 00:51:57,360
And then, there's you, Yugi Mutou-san, the one and
only chosen vessel for the Pharaoh's spirit in this world.

698
00:51:59,070 --> 00:52:02,820
You continued on your path
and protected the Puzzle.

699
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:10,080
W-What is that?

700
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:13,290
It is where we of Prana assemble.

701
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:14,750
Prana?

702
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:19,550
We are now the inheritors of
the late Shin-sama's will.

703
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:22,800
The travelers to a new dimension.

704
00:52:23,010 --> 00:52:24,850
And, Yugi-san,

705
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:29,560
you are like us in that you
possess a similar energy wave.

706
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:31,020
Who are you?

707
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:33,440
I am Sera.

708
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:36,230
Come with us to a new world.

709
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:39,690
You are of the chosen,
just as we are.

710
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,740
What the?

711
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:51,040
Sera, you...

712
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:56,250
But, this is...!

713
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:01,970
Mr. Kaiba...

714
00:53:02,090 --> 00:53:06,260
I am unable to assemble any more of the Puzzle.

715
00:53:06,430 --> 00:53:10,520
Unfortunately, there are two pieces with
similar mass as all the others,

716
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:13,190
but their shapes do not align at all.

717
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:20,820
Don't tell me, he...

718
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:26,280
H-Hey, Bakura?

719
00:53:26,410 --> 00:53:29,410
Come on, let me hear
that story of yours.

720
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:34,960
Well, it's not one I really
want to remember, but...

721
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:45,890
It was when my father heard that a certain antique
that he had spent many years searching for...

722
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:49,350
...was located in the Valley of the Kings.

723
00:53:49,470 --> 00:53:53,810
And in order to obtain it,
he set off on his own.

724
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:58,650
For whatever reason, I was intrigued
and trailed him in secret.

725
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,150
Why?

726
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:05,240
Why bring this up!?

727
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:08,490
I don't want to even remember
what happened on that night!

728
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:11,540
Hey, Bakura. What's wrong?

729
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:12,410
Hey!

730
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:17,790
W-What?

731
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:22,510
But, how?
And when!?

732
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,380
Also, the people and cars, they're...

733
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:36,350
W-Who are all you!?

734
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:38,230
The sight you are seeing now...

735
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:41,270
...is that of your usual tree-lined avenue.

736
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:46,860
I have gone ahead and slightly altered your
neural information of it with my powers.

737
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:50,070
Aigami...
What are you talking about?

738
00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:51,950
Jonouchi...

739
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:54,330
I have some business
to attend to with Bakura.

740
00:54:54,830 --> 00:54:57,160
Hate to do this, but I'm going to
have to make you disappear.

741
00:54:58,870 --> 00:55:00,170
Why, you! What's your deal!?

742
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:06,050
Tch, looks like you're serious about this.

743
00:55:06,510 --> 00:55:07,800
Hey, Bakura, on your feet!

744
00:55:08,010 --> 00:55:09,510
Run away! Come on!

745
00:55:11,050 --> 00:55:12,220
Hey, Bakura!

746
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:15,680
Dammit!
Why, you bastard!

747
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:20,600
Resorting to violence, are we?
As I suspected, such low class.

748
00:55:20,730 --> 00:55:21,770
What!?

749
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:25,780
Allow me to now show
you the truth of this world.

750
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:29,410
Where do you people get
your visual information from?

751
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:34,240
Is the information that always goes
through your eyes the truth or not?

752
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:37,580
Am I truly being seen by your eyes?

753
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:40,420
You're pissing me
off with this crap!

754
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:41,960
Wha-...

755
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:44,840
W-What!?

756
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:48,420
Safe travels...
To the world of truth.

757
00:55:53,970 --> 00:55:56,770
A piece of the Millennium Puzzle...

758
00:55:57,640 --> 00:56:00,270
It's already so late.
Everyone is taking their time.

759
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:04,980
Honda-kun?

760
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:08,150
Yugi! I've been trying to
get you on the phone!

761
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:09,700
Huh?

762
00:56:10,110 --> 00:56:12,410
Come with me.
It's about Jonouchi...

763
00:56:25,670 --> 00:56:28,380
W-Wha? Where am I?

764
00:56:28,590 --> 00:56:30,840
Bakura? Aigami?

765
00:56:31,010 --> 00:56:32,930
That group of weird kids...

766
00:56:33,970 --> 00:56:35,890
Also, something's kind of...

767
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:44,690
Here, no one notices you.

768
00:56:44,810 --> 00:56:46,570
Why, you!
Aigami!

769
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:48,230
Where are you!?

770
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:51,400
I will tell you something, Jonouchi.

771
00:56:51,990 --> 00:56:56,660
The world that your eyes usually see is
not a world composing of you alone.

772
00:56:57,490 --> 00:57:00,750
The temporal and spacial
frequencies the brain perceives

773
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:03,920
are shared with the inhabitants of your world.

774
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:07,880
It is commonly referred
to as "collective consciousness."

775
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:14,010
Simply put, in your world,
your school, your city, and even your friends' faces...

776
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:18,220
All those who perceive the
same frequencies in your world

777
00:57:18,390 --> 00:57:21,230
unconsciously confirm them with
one another to establish...

778
00:57:21,350 --> 00:57:25,770
...a hologram-esque world
constructed in a domain of time and space.

779
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:27,610
A hologram...?

780
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:29,570
Quit screwing with me!

781
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:33,530
The world you are seeing now is made
from your neural information alone.

782
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:39,410
In other words, it's a world barred from accessing
neural information with anyone other than yourself.

783
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:44,710
You are lost in a world all of your own—
one which is isolated from the collective consciousness.

784
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:48,420
Shut up! I'll bust out of here in no time!!

785
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:51,760
Run! Run!

786
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:55,720
Herein lies the game.
A neural image escape game.

787
00:58:01,930 --> 00:58:05,560
Dammit, just how freaking
long is this street!?

788
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,270
Jonouchi.

789
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:12,740
In order to make it out alive, you need only
rely on the memories within your brain.

790
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:15,570
Now, remember!

791
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:17,780
Remember?

792
00:58:17,950 --> 00:58:21,620
After the road with the trees, I'm pretty sure
there's the shopping district.

793
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:25,790
And...
That's right! Sanpei-jiisan!!

794
00:58:31,590 --> 00:58:33,800
Sanpei-jiisan?

795
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:37,470
Do you get it, Jonouchi?

796
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:41,930
Even if you do exist within this world,

797
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:47,310
unless the inhabitants around you have
memories of you in their subconscious,

798
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:50,730
you will not be able to exist.

799
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:59,820
The city...
The city is crumbling!

800
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:02,700
Farewell...

801
00:59:04,330 --> 00:59:08,370
By the time I passed through here,
his bike was here abandoned...

802
00:59:08,580 --> 00:59:10,460
There's no way in hell
would ever forget this!

803
00:59:11,090 --> 00:59:15,170
Jonouchi-kun should have
been with Bakura-kun and Aigami-kun.

804
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:17,800
Let's search the area!

805
00:59:18,970 --> 00:59:25,470
Bakura, just a moment ago, you said that you
didn't want to remember that night, didn't you?

806
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:30,100
To me, however, that was a night
that I will never forget!

807
00:59:35,730 --> 00:59:39,820
Shadi-sama, why must people
persist in conflict?

808
00:59:39,990 --> 00:59:46,450
For conflict exists within all of our hearts.

809
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:49,000
With our hearts?

810
00:59:49,210 --> 00:59:52,840
But, none of us have ever fought before.

811
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:55,460
Conflict exists in us, regardless?

812
00:59:56,130 --> 00:59:57,590
Why, yes, Diva.

813
00:59:57,720 --> 01:00:00,380
So long as fear exists in the hearts of any and all.

814
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:02,680
Fear... sir?

815
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:06,810
All conflict spawns fear.

816
01:00:07,350 --> 01:00:09,270
The fear of loss...

817
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:13,440
Be it one's life, one's loved one,
one's land, or one's country...

818
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,860
The fear of loss extends to many things...

819
01:00:16,190 --> 01:00:18,530
Then, what about those who rule?

820
01:00:18,690 --> 01:00:21,200
Rulers who have nothing to fear

821
01:00:21,410 --> 01:00:24,870
exist in this world and take so much away.

822
01:00:25,450 --> 01:00:27,540
Those who take something away

823
01:00:27,750 --> 01:00:30,580
are ruled by the fear of
something being taken away.

824
01:00:31,250 --> 01:00:33,630
A constant pattern now...

825
01:00:33,790 --> 01:00:35,540
...and into eternity.

826
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:37,840
I am not afraid.

827
01:00:38,050 --> 01:00:41,050
Not ever since you saved us
that one time, Shadi-sama.

828
01:00:41,550 --> 01:00:44,390
And not as long as I can be with
you and everyone else, Shadi-sama!

829
01:00:45,550 --> 01:00:48,180
That is fear, Diva.

830
01:00:49,930 --> 01:00:53,230
Everyone, listen well.

831
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:58,900
Once all seven Items are assembled in
the Tablet of Pharaoh's Memories housed here,

832
01:00:59,070 --> 01:01:01,070
the doors to the netherworld shall be opened,

833
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:04,240
and the spirit of the ancient Pharaoh will pass on.

834
01:01:04,450 --> 01:01:05,570
Once that happens,

835
01:01:05,910 --> 01:01:13,370
the door to a wonderful new world devoid of borders, race,
conflict and even the barriers of language shall be opened,

836
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:18,420
and the chosen ones
shall be led to that world.

837
01:01:18,630 --> 01:01:21,420
That is all of you.

838
01:01:21,630 --> 01:01:25,260
However, you must be cautious.

839
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:30,640
Should the Pharaoh that has passed to the netherworld
be resurrected in this world yet again,

840
01:01:31,270 --> 01:01:33,940
you all will be bound to this dimension,

841
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:37,610
and the door to the future
shall never be opened again.

842
01:01:38,020 --> 01:01:41,820
Remember this well.
Fear renders all to nothing.

843
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:44,280
Fear...

844
01:01:52,830 --> 01:01:55,620
All of you, step back.

845
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:59,340
At l ast...
At long last, I have found it.

846
01:02:02,210 --> 01:02:04,680
I knew it...
I knew they were here!

847
01:02:05,510 --> 01:02:09,510
At long last, I have come
across this golden ring!

848
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:12,980
Please! I beg of you...

849
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:15,980
Please, let me have this golden ring!

850
01:02:16,810 --> 01:02:18,310
I am afraid to say,

851
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:21,480
this ring already has an owner set in line.

852
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:27,110
I also have heard that a evil
spirit is sealed within this.

853
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:28,820
It is better for you not
to be involved with it.

854
01:02:29,950 --> 01:02:31,830
W-Wait, please! I am begging you!

855
01:02:32,330 --> 01:02:35,160
I am begging you to hand it over to me!

856
01:02:35,330 --> 01:02:36,710
Oh, please!!

857
01:02:37,290 --> 01:02:41,420
To become the owner of the ring,
you must first go through its trial.

858
01:02:41,630 --> 01:02:46,010
And then, you must abide
by the will of the ring.

859
01:02:46,430 --> 01:02:48,090
I'll do anything!
Anything!

860
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:50,010
So, like I said, please!

861
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:55,100
Take that ring and
put it around your neck.

862
01:02:55,310 --> 01:02:56,850
This?

863
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:04,610
The ring will give you its answer.

864
01:03:06,570 --> 01:03:07,860
Like this, right?

865
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:10,620
Now the golden ring is mine!

866
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:26,260
Daddy!

867
01:03:38,060 --> 01:03:39,560
Daddy! Daddy!

868
01:03:41,270 --> 01:03:44,190
The ring...

869
01:03:44,690 --> 01:03:46,900
The ring...

870
01:03:47,690 --> 01:03:50,490
It's here. It's here, Daddy!

871
01:03:55,410 --> 01:03:56,290
What is this!?

872
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:13,510
Are you all right, boy?

873
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:14,640
Hey!

874
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:18,850
Shadi...

875
01:04:19,060 --> 01:04:22,480
I have finally found myself quite the
comfortable owner to inhabit.

876
01:04:24,610 --> 01:04:27,110
So, rest easy and be gone!

877
01:04:29,570 --> 01:04:30,530
Shadi-sama!!

878
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:44,790
One day, the seven Items shall
be gathered in the tablet.

879
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:48,670
However, out of all of them,
three stand for justice

880
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:51,800
while three hold a wicked consciousness,

881
01:04:51,970 --> 01:04:57,140
with the final Item having
sides of both sealed within it.

882
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:00,850
Shadi-sama!
Shadi-sama!

883
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:03,980
Diva, take this.

884
01:05:05,310 --> 01:05:10,990
The boy serving as the vessel who
will resurrect the Pharaoh's spirit...

885
01:05:11,110 --> 01:05:14,570
He is the same as all of you...

886
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:23,040
—Shadi-sama!
—Shadi-sama!

887
01:05:23,210 --> 01:05:25,250
Finally kicked the bucket, eh?

888
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,090
All of you are eyesores too.

889
01:05:28,670 --> 01:05:29,590
Get lost!!

890
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:41,560
I am going to paint this
entire world in darkness.

891
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:52,990
So? Remember now, Bakura?

892
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:56,110
Did I really...

893
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:58,240
I have been waiting forever for this.

894
01:05:58,370 --> 01:06:01,450
For the moment I take
vengeance with my own hands!

895
01:06:01,660 --> 01:06:07,420
No, I was being controlled,
by that wretched ring...

896
01:06:07,750 --> 01:06:08,880
Silence, you!

897
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,800
Show me your true form!

898
01:06:12,550 --> 01:06:16,590
There is no true form!
Everything is that ring's doing...

899
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:18,850
ー主ーーー

900
01:06:18,970 --> 01:06:20,430
But, as for me,

901
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:24,980
As for me, I did something that
cannot be undone

902
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:28,150
to a person near and dear to you,
by my own hands, didn't I?

903
01:06:30,940 --> 01:06:32,570
Bakura...

904
01:06:34,990 --> 01:06:38,120
Dammit! Aigami sure freaking said it.

905
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:42,410
Unless we all stay connected, then everything
in this world will vanish!

906
01:06:48,710 --> 01:06:50,750
My foot, it's...!

907
01:06:55,130 --> 01:06:58,840
Quit pulling my leg!
Like hell I'm gonna get wiped out!!

908
01:06:59,300 --> 01:07:02,640
Aigami-kun, forgive me.

909
01:07:03,020 --> 01:07:05,770
Silence.
Not another word!!

910
01:07:05,930 --> 01:07:08,190
I will enact my revenge on you...

911
01:07:09,810 --> 01:07:12,440
What is the matter, Diva?

912
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:15,650
Now is the time to settle our score.

913
01:07:16,450 --> 01:07:17,610
Mani...

914
01:07:17,740 --> 01:07:21,120
Or perhaps, you have come so
far just to have cold feet?

915
01:07:21,450 --> 01:07:23,450
That's not it! It's just...

916
01:07:23,620 --> 01:07:26,620
In that case, you should stand back.

917
01:07:29,290 --> 01:07:31,330
I will do the honors
of eliminating him!

918
01:07:31,670 --> 01:07:33,800
Mani! What's gotten into you?

919
01:07:34,170 --> 01:07:38,050
Why, nothing at all.
Nothing except...

920
01:07:41,260 --> 01:07:44,680
That is the Millennium Ring?
How?

921
01:07:44,850 --> 01:07:46,020
I happened to find it.

922
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:49,770
Right in the Mortuary Temple where
Kaiba and you had your duel!

923
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:52,440
Mani, stop!

924
01:07:52,810 --> 01:07:55,190
The Ring's wicked powers have got you...

925
01:07:57,530 --> 01:07:59,530
Be gone, Bakura!

926
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:09,040
—Mani!
—Stay back!

927
01:08:11,580 --> 01:08:14,340
Diva,
feelings of hatred...

928
01:08:15,670 --> 01:08:17,340
consume oneself...

929
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:21,180
and then, drive you to...!

930
01:08:31,060 --> 01:08:33,730
Mani!
Mani!!

931
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:41,950
Mani! Mani!

932
01:08:43,740 --> 01:08:45,410
Mani!

933
01:08:45,530 --> 01:08:48,950
Mani! Mani, why did you...

934
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:57,300
Hatred, revenge,

935
01:08:57,500 --> 01:08:58,630
fear...

936
01:09:00,010 --> 01:09:01,590
I have been...

937
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:06,560
The cause for all of this has been this Ring.

938
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:08,560
Jonouchi-kun!!

939
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:10,520
Jonouchi-kun!!

940
01:09:23,070 --> 01:09:24,610
Looking for something?

941
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:27,490
Yugi Mutou...

942
01:09:27,620 --> 01:09:29,490
Aigami-kun!

943
01:09:29,620 --> 01:09:31,290
The hell's this?

944
01:09:31,790 --> 01:09:33,830
Who on Earth are you?

945
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:36,130
We are Prana.

946
01:09:36,290 --> 01:09:40,800
An entity with a collective consciousness far
more evolved from that of your own.

947
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:43,340
W-What are you talking about, Aigami!?

948
01:09:43,590 --> 01:09:45,340
The entity known as Aigami, too,

949
01:09:45,510 --> 01:09:48,640
is but an illusion planted
into your memories.

950
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:52,310
My true name is Diva.

951
01:09:52,430 --> 01:09:54,480
You're looking for Bakura and Jonouchi, correct?

952
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:56,480
—Huh!?
—As for them...

953
01:09:56,690 --> 01:09:58,690
I've made them vanish off
to the far side of the dimension.

954
01:09:58,940 --> 01:09:59,860
You what!?

955
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:03,150
Vessel of the Pharaoh,
Yugi Mutou...

956
01:10:04,030 --> 01:10:06,360
You will be joining them.

957
01:10:06,530 --> 01:10:08,490
By the cards of arcane magic,

958
01:10:08,660 --> 01:10:11,540
I will send you off to the far side of the dimension.

959
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,210
Aigami-kun...

960
01:10:27,180 --> 01:10:29,390
D-Dammit...

961
01:10:29,510 --> 01:10:33,230
N-Not here...

962
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:37,310
I-I'm done for...

963
01:10:44,570 --> 01:10:45,780
That's...

964
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:53,580
It's you!

965
01:10:57,750 --> 01:10:59,040
W-What is this?

966
01:11:02,420 --> 01:11:03,760
I-Impossible!

967
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:11,600
Jonouchi-kun!

968
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:14,270
You guys... But, why?

969
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:18,060
Did I manage to make it back?

970
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:20,230
T-This can't be.

971
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:24,780
You should be a pile of particles
in a far side of the dimension.

972
01:11:24,940 --> 01:11:28,110
You sure don't get it, Aigami.

973
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:30,620
Our bonds, y'see...

974
01:11:30,780 --> 01:11:33,120
are always connected,
transcending dimensions!

975
01:11:36,620 --> 01:11:39,370
How did he beat our powers?

976
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:41,290
How? This isn't possible...

977
01:11:41,460 --> 01:11:42,590
We cannot fight like this.

978
01:11:43,170 --> 01:11:45,800
What's wrong?
Already time for the kiddies to go home?

979
01:11:46,510 --> 01:11:49,340
Then, before you do, how
about you release Bakura?

980
01:11:50,390 --> 01:11:53,350
To think you would
confuse our Prana's Mind...

981
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:55,930
You are an interesting lot.

982
01:11:56,060 --> 01:11:57,770
W-Why you!
Hold up!

983
01:11:58,390 --> 01:11:59,600
Damn.

984
01:11:59,980 --> 01:12:02,770
Jonouchi-kun, we have to save Bakura.

985
01:12:02,980 --> 01:12:05,030
Okay! Let's split up and search, then!

986
01:12:05,150 --> 01:12:07,280
You got it!!

987
01:12:08,650 --> 01:12:10,780
Say, Yugi.

988
01:12:12,070 --> 01:12:13,950
You see, I...

989
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:16,450
I...

990
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:19,620
Nah, it's nothing.

991
01:12:20,250 --> 01:12:21,620
Jonouchi-kun...

992
01:12:26,420 --> 01:12:28,300
Shin-sama...

993
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:31,630
We have...

994
01:12:51,570 --> 01:12:56,280
Aigami, I need to ask you where you
put those other two pieces.

995
01:12:57,410 --> 01:13:01,620
Heh, you caught on quicker
than I expected, Kaiba.

996
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:04,130
Also, these goggles...

997
01:13:04,250 --> 01:13:06,960
You've sealed off my ability with these, I assume.

998
01:13:07,170 --> 01:13:11,800
It wouldn't be to my interests if I had your buddies
flooding on in from out of nowhere again.

999
01:13:11,970 --> 01:13:13,010
Take him away.

1000
01:13:28,610 --> 01:13:31,240
Bakura-kun...

1001
01:13:41,620 --> 01:13:42,960
Kaiba-kun!

1002
01:13:45,130 --> 01:13:47,170
What are you doing here?

1003
01:13:47,290 --> 01:13:48,460
Yugi.

1004
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:52,840
In three days time, there will be an
announcement ceremony for my latest Duel Disk.

1005
01:13:52,970 --> 01:13:57,350
It is there where I will be holding a
dueling competition with duelists that I have selected.

1006
01:13:57,470 --> 01:14:00,180
Your participation will be mandatory.

1007
01:14:00,970 --> 01:14:02,680
Wait a second, Kaiba-kun!

1008
01:14:05,480 --> 01:14:06,650
But, that's...!

1009
01:14:06,810 --> 01:14:08,860
Don't tell me that you...

1010
01:14:08,980 --> 01:14:10,190
It's just as you see,

1011
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:14,030
and while it may be missing some of its pieces,
it will soon be complete.

1012
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:16,700
There are just two pieces left.

1013
01:14:16,820 --> 01:14:21,410
Yugi, does that treasure box of
yours even now hold treasure?

1014
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,290
How do you know that?

1015
01:14:25,460 --> 01:14:28,540
This entire city is
under my surveillance.

1016
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:31,880
Kaiba-kun, what is your gain?

1017
01:14:32,420 --> 01:14:37,720
I have but one goal. The spirit of the king
which resides in this Puzzle.

1018
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:41,560
You will put the Millennium Puzzle
around your neck once more,

1019
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:45,520
and summon the other Yugi before me!

1020
01:14:45,850 --> 01:14:47,150
B-But, that can't...

1021
01:14:49,690 --> 01:14:54,400
That is what you too wish for in
the inner recesses of your heart, isn't it?

1022
01:14:55,030 --> 01:14:58,530
Yugi, I made sure to lock up
the shop behind me!

1023
01:14:59,700 --> 01:15:01,910
Aigami is under my custody.

1024
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:06,250
Also, he will appear at the competition.

1025
01:15:06,370 --> 01:15:11,250
So long as he has one of the remaining
pieces, you have no choice but to fight.

1026
01:15:11,540 --> 01:15:14,880
You will then resurrect the king
by your very own hand.

1027
01:15:15,590 --> 01:15:19,590
Only then will the future by unlocked—
one in which the king's spirit

1028
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:23,930
does battle with me once more.

1029
01:15:23,930 --> 01:15:27,020
That's...!

1030
01:15:31,190 --> 01:15:33,440
Yugi-san...

1031
01:15:40,030 --> 01:15:40,740
Huh?

1032
01:15:41,740 --> 01:15:43,740
Oh, man, I'm safe.

1033
01:15:44,870 --> 01:15:47,460
Sera, you saved me...

1034
01:15:48,710 --> 01:15:51,080
...and this.

1035
01:15:51,630 --> 01:15:54,670
My brother gave me the very
piece I entrusted to you...

1036
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:57,920
It was my last option to save
Diva from going out of control.

1037
01:15:58,220 --> 01:15:59,720
Brother?

1038
01:15:59,970 --> 01:16:02,010
Kaiba knows.

1039
01:16:02,140 --> 01:16:04,470
Even if he does collect
all the pieces,

1040
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:08,140
unless you do it, he cannot bring
about the Pharaoh's resurrection.

1041
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:13,020
Should the Pharaoh be revived,
then we shall be bound to this dimension,

1042
01:16:13,270 --> 01:16:16,360
forever denied our chance at the future.

1043
01:16:16,650 --> 01:16:20,990
Yugi-san, whether you decide to
complete the Puzzle or not...

1044
01:16:21,110 --> 01:16:23,160
I leave all of that
solely up to you.

1045
01:16:23,700 --> 01:16:25,740
And, please, my brother...

1046
01:16:25,870 --> 01:16:27,910
Save my brother.

1047
01:16:38,630 --> 01:16:40,050
Sera.

1048
01:16:40,170 --> 01:16:42,550
Where are you?

1049
01:16:42,890 --> 01:16:44,390
Where have you gone?

1050
01:16:45,350 --> 01:16:47,060
Sera?

1051
01:16:48,470 --> 01:16:49,980
Sera...?

1052
01:16:51,350 --> 01:16:53,060
W-What the heck is
this kid's problem?

1053
01:16:53,190 --> 01:16:54,770
My, what's this?

1054
01:16:55,060 --> 01:16:56,570
My, what a dreadful bother.

1055
01:16:56,900 --> 01:16:58,940
Aah, apologies, folks!

1056
01:16:59,070 --> 01:17:01,950
Tch, he's one of those beggar children, y'see.

1057
01:17:02,070 --> 01:17:09,040
You'll find a lot of these damn kids, who got
abandoned or lost their folks, wandering 'round these parts.

1058
01:17:12,750 --> 01:17:13,460
Sera...

1059
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:16,290
Big Brother...

1060
01:17:25,090 --> 01:17:26,470
And how might
we be feeling?

1061
01:17:29,470 --> 01:17:30,180
Where am I?

1062
01:17:31,430 --> 01:17:33,650
This is the Kaiba Corporation research lab.

1063
01:17:34,100 --> 01:17:37,150
Woah there.
Try to call the cavalry all you want, it won't work.

1064
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:39,320
Aigami, was it?

1065
01:17:39,610 --> 01:17:41,650
What I'd like to
ask you pertains to this.

1066
01:17:42,110 --> 01:17:46,320
Once we scanned this baby, it showed us that
there was a piece of the Puzzle inside it.

1067
01:17:46,660 --> 01:17:48,830
So, the problem we face
is how to open it, which...

1068
01:17:50,450 --> 01:17:53,120
Can't quite do it by
your ability alone, can you?

1069
01:17:53,460 --> 01:17:58,130
It is true that your older brother, Seto Kaiba
possesses an unparalleled intellect.

1070
01:17:58,460 --> 01:18:02,720
However, even with all the cutting-edge technology
of the Kaiba Corporation at your disposal,

1071
01:18:03,130 --> 01:18:06,220
it is impossible for you to
tread into a dimensional domain.

1072
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:10,180
Not to mention, you've
managed to confirm that

1073
01:18:10,310 --> 01:18:11,930
I ran away with two of the pieces, have you not?

1074
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:15,690
In which case, where ever could
the other piece be, I wonder?

1075
01:18:15,980 --> 01:18:18,440
Oh, come now.
Did no one fill you in?

1076
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:19,270
What was that?

1077
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:24,200
The little fact that the other piece is
already pretty much as good as ours, that is.

1078
01:18:24,490 --> 01:18:25,660
What did you say!?

1079
01:18:26,110 --> 01:18:28,700
Well, we've finally got you
singing a different tune.

1080
01:18:28,830 --> 01:18:29,830
Why, yes.

1081
01:18:29,950 --> 01:18:33,040
It was in the possession of someone
that you are well familiar with.

1082
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:36,790
They dare not have hurt Sera...

1083
01:18:50,510 --> 01:18:53,060
Still, is this going to be okay?
He's dealing with you-know-who...

1084
01:18:53,180 --> 01:18:54,310
Give me a break!

1085
01:18:54,810 --> 01:18:57,520
Anzu, don't worry. I'm going to get Bakura-kun back for sure.

1086
01:18:54,810 --> 01:18:57,520
There isn't anybody around
who can beat Yugi!

1087
01:19:20,670 --> 01:19:22,800
W-What in the
hell is going on!?

1088
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:29,260
Duelists around the world!

1089
01:19:29,550 --> 01:19:34,600
This is the next generation of Duel Disk's
Power Vision!!

1090
01:19:36,020 --> 01:19:39,310
All of that was a Solid Vision image!?

1091
01:19:39,730 --> 01:19:41,440
I ask all of you!

1092
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:43,320
What does it mean to do battle!?

1093
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:50,280
The moment man is given life in this world,

1094
01:19:50,410 --> 01:19:54,290
they harbor a soul within
the vessel known as the body,

1095
01:19:54,410 --> 01:19:57,710
in other words, the body is
but a prison for the soul!

1096
01:19:57,910 --> 01:20:01,380
A prison that does not permit one's
soul to leave until they expire!

1097
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:06,130
And, in time, the body will take up
arms to defend that soul!

1098
01:20:06,420 --> 01:20:08,630
Is your threat your mortal coil!?

1099
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:10,800
Is your threat someone other!?

1100
01:20:11,090 --> 01:20:13,640
Is your threat someplace other!?

1101
01:20:13,930 --> 01:20:16,810
We battle for the sake of
those we wish to protect!

1102
01:20:16,930 --> 01:20:19,770
We battle with those
of differing ideologies!

1103
01:20:20,100 --> 01:20:22,980
Due to the foolish
bloodsport known as war,

1104
01:20:23,110 --> 01:20:26,030
the history of battles have
been forever repeated!

1105
01:20:26,440 --> 01:20:27,820
However, ironically,

1106
01:20:27,940 --> 01:20:31,320
not even the victors are
allowed to escape their prisons!

1107
01:20:31,610 --> 01:20:33,160
Until now, ladies and gentlemen!

1108
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:37,660
This next generation of Duel Disk
will help to set our souls free!

1109
01:20:38,290 --> 01:20:40,290
We will escape our prisons,

1110
01:20:40,460 --> 01:20:44,500
ushering in the era where we all coexist
via a network spanning the globe!

1111
01:20:44,670 --> 01:20:49,970
Boundaries, race, ideals, language—
By transcending any and all discrepancies,

1112
01:20:50,090 --> 01:20:53,340
we will go headlong
into a new future!

1113
01:20:53,510 --> 01:20:57,390
May the next generation of
Duel Disk harbor the spirit of battle!

1114
01:20:57,770 --> 01:20:58,810
The arms you take up...

1115
01:20:58,930 --> 01:21:02,140
...will be your cards!

1116
01:21:12,820 --> 01:21:19,540
Now, the time has come to
show yourself, O mighty duelists!

1117
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:29,050
On this stage, with the eyes
around the world watching,

1118
01:21:29,340 --> 01:21:32,720
I will take the mightiest
duelists handpicked by me

1119
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:34,590
and pummel them into the dirt!!

1120
01:21:35,010 --> 01:21:36,220
Yugi...

1121
01:21:36,350 --> 01:21:37,390
And then,

1122
01:21:37,510 --> 01:21:42,560
there is this golden puzzle in which
the proud title of champion is sealed!

1123
01:21:42,690 --> 01:21:45,400
However, it is short just a few pieces!

1124
01:21:45,690 --> 01:21:46,560
The remaining two

1125
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:50,440
are being held by the
two duelists I have invited here!

1126
01:21:50,690 --> 01:21:52,450
You mean, he...!

1127
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:56,070
I will trounce these
two individuals,

1128
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:57,740
attaining the title of strongest...

1129
01:21:58,030 --> 01:22:00,080
Forgive me.

1130
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:04,580
I handed over the piece you left in my
care over to Yugi-san without telling you...

1131
01:22:05,370 --> 01:22:07,920
Sera.
So, you're safe, then?

1132
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:09,920
Still, why give it to Yugi?

1133
01:22:10,050 --> 01:22:11,760
I had no other choice.

1134
01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:15,430
Should the piece had
fallen into Kaiba's hands...

1135
01:22:16,550 --> 01:22:17,930
Rest assured,

1136
01:22:18,050 --> 01:22:22,100
no matter what happens, I will never let
Kaiba have the remaining pieces.

1137
01:22:23,850 --> 01:22:26,560
First, Aigami,
I'll start with you!

1138
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:35,910
Kaiba-kun, wait!

1139
01:22:36,610 --> 01:22:38,530
This is my battle to fight!

1140
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:41,040
Between me and Aigami-kun!

1141
01:22:43,580 --> 01:22:44,910
Yugi...

1142
01:22:45,250 --> 01:22:47,120
Don't butt in, Yugi!

1143
01:22:47,290 --> 01:22:48,420
I will beat him by my hands.

1144
01:22:48,750 --> 01:22:54,630
Kaiba-kun, Aigami-kun has used his powers
to send my friend to another dimension.

1145
01:22:55,090 --> 01:22:58,340
I'm going to get back
my friend—get back Bakura-kun!

1146
01:22:58,680 --> 01:23:01,930
That's why this duel is mine!

1147
01:23:03,140 --> 01:23:04,350
Yugi...

1148
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:08,650
I am getting back an
that important friend of mine!

1149
01:23:11,770 --> 01:23:12,860
Yugi...

1150
01:23:19,620 --> 01:23:22,660
Very well,
do battle with him,

1151
01:23:22,950 --> 01:23:24,500
within my presence!

1152
01:23:25,290 --> 01:23:27,160
Kaiba-kun...

1153
01:23:39,470 --> 01:23:43,180
Yugi... No, Vessel of the Pharaoh.

1154
01:23:43,390 --> 01:23:45,060
Do you think
you can beat me?

1155
01:23:45,310 --> 01:23:46,850
Aigami-kun,

1156
01:23:47,140 --> 01:23:51,940
the piece of the Puzzle that
Sera entrusted to me is right in here.

1157
01:23:52,310 --> 01:23:54,190
She wants me to stop you.

1158
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:55,940
Sera said so herself.

1159
01:23:56,990 --> 01:23:58,360
Stop me?

1160
01:24:03,490 --> 01:24:05,830
No matter what happens to you two...

1161
01:24:06,330 --> 01:24:08,040
I will fight you
with all I've got!

1162
01:24:08,160 --> 01:24:09,330
Yugi!

1163
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:15,420
—Kaiba-kun?
—Use that.

1164
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:19,380
Now, show me how
you two intend to fight.

1165
01:24:20,510 --> 01:24:22,430
Here I come, Aigami-kun!

1166
01:24:29,100 --> 01:24:32,520
This battle...
This dimensional domain duel...

1167
01:24:32,650 --> 01:24:34,270
...will come to settle matters!

1168
01:24:36,860 --> 01:24:38,280
Brother!

1169
01:24:38,860 --> 01:24:40,360
It's the same duel from before!

1170
01:24:41,070 --> 01:24:43,620
—What is this?
—What's going on here?

1171
01:24:47,910 --> 01:24:49,500
Jonouchi... What's that?

1172
01:24:52,750 --> 01:24:54,790
What on Earth?

1173
01:24:56,710 --> 01:24:57,880
What is this?

1174
01:25:02,930 --> 01:25:05,300
Big Brother, come to your senses.

1175
01:25:09,810 --> 01:25:11,890
—Is this...
—A new kind of dueling?

1176
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:15,730
This is Aigami-kun's group's dueling...

1177
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:18,070
My turn! Draw!!

1178
01:25:19,900 --> 01:25:21,900
Here I come, Aigami-kun.

1179
01:25:22,110 --> 01:25:25,070
I Dimension Summon a monster!

1180
01:25:33,460 --> 01:25:36,750
Giant Sentry of Stone!

1181
01:25:44,550 --> 01:25:47,600
This will end my turn.

1182
01:25:48,010 --> 01:25:54,600
Hmph, I intend to make you realize
how little of a threat you are to us Prana!!

1183
01:25:54,940 --> 01:25:58,570
Come forth, Vijam the Cubic Seed!

1184
01:25:59,650 --> 01:26:06,120
Next, I use one Vijam to
Dimension Special Summon this monster!

1185
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:11,250
Come forth, Geira Guile the Cubic King!

1186
01:26:16,750 --> 01:26:20,000
Cubic King Monsters have an
original attack power of zero,

1187
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:24,470
but by integrating it with Vijam,
it raises its attack power by 800 points.

1188
01:26:24,720 --> 01:26:28,640
In addition, when a Cubic King Monster
appears in this dimension,

1189
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:32,180
it inflicts 800 points of damage to you!

1190
01:26:32,680 --> 01:26:36,270
Next, the Permanent Magic, Cubic Karma!

1191
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:38,980
By integrating two
more Vijam,

1192
01:26:39,150 --> 01:26:41,110
it increases Geira Guile's
attack power!

1193
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:47,240
Now, Geira Guile!

1194
01:26:47,410 --> 01:26:50,160
Obliterate his monster!

1195
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:59,210
And then, take this damage equal
to your monster's Status!

1196
01:27:02,250 --> 01:27:03,300
Yugi!

1197
01:27:06,510 --> 01:27:09,470
Trap, activate!
Dig of Destiny!

1198
01:27:10,680 --> 01:27:13,890
By receiving damage, I get one card to...

1199
01:27:14,060 --> 01:27:15,230
draw!!

1200
01:27:16,810 --> 01:27:19,310
Once a Cubic King Monster
finishes battle,

1201
01:27:19,480 --> 01:27:24,860
by returning it back to the deck, it brings out the
Vijams that it had assimilated to the field.

1202
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:29,030
And, I gain a new Cubic King Monster!

1203
01:27:29,240 --> 01:27:31,330
I Dimension Special Summon again!

1204
01:27:32,950 --> 01:27:37,710
Come forth, Vulcan Dragni the Cubic King!

1205
01:27:40,420 --> 01:27:43,130
First up, the effect damage!

1206
01:27:45,550 --> 01:27:49,510
Now, this time it's
a direct attack!

1207
01:27:58,770 --> 01:27:59,730
That's not all.

1208
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:03,520
Allow me to show you what a
true Cubic King Monster looks like.

1209
01:28:05,820 --> 01:28:09,200
O woven light!
O thicket of darkness!

1210
01:28:09,610 --> 01:28:15,410
Open the door to a new future so to
return the world to its intended state!

1211
01:28:15,620 --> 01:28:21,080
Show thyself,
Indiora Death Volt the Cubic Emperor!

1212
01:28:28,300 --> 01:28:30,090
Oh, crap!

1213
01:28:30,340 --> 01:28:32,590
If this next attack connects...

1214
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:35,180
This is the end, Yugi!

1215
01:28:35,970 --> 01:28:39,350
Be gone to the far side of the dimension!

1216
01:28:42,810 --> 01:28:45,690
I send a monster to the Cemetery...

1217
01:28:45,820 --> 01:28:47,400
to activate my Trap!

1218
01:28:48,440 --> 01:28:51,320
I'm counting on you,
Silent Swordsman!

1219
01:29:01,540 --> 01:29:04,960
Reduced its attack to survive, huh?

1220
01:29:05,460 --> 01:29:07,760
My turn...

1221
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:08,920
Draw!

1222
01:29:12,470 --> 01:29:16,010
I Dimension Summon this monster!

1223
01:29:16,180 --> 01:29:19,640
Gaia Lord the Dark Knight!

1224
01:29:26,650 --> 01:29:28,940
He's raising its attack
power to the max again?

1225
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:32,150
Go! Attack Indiora Death Volt!

1226
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:42,750
That destroys your monster!

1227
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:47,960
Even if Indiora is destroyed,
it returns to my hand,

1228
01:29:48,090 --> 01:29:52,380
summoning the assimilated
Vijams in its stead.

1229
01:29:52,670 --> 01:29:56,140
Then, I will send the Cubic Karma
on my field to the Cemetery

1230
01:29:56,390 --> 01:29:59,430
to halve your Life Points!

1231
01:30:00,180 --> 01:30:02,980
ぅわあ

1232
01:30:03,810 --> 01:30:06,190
This is no good.
He can't make a dent in him.

1233
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:07,770
Yugi won't lose!

1234
01:30:08,190 --> 01:30:11,400
Now, do you get it?
You cannot beat me.

1235
01:30:13,820 --> 01:30:15,490
You still intend on fighting?

1236
01:30:16,160 --> 01:30:18,700
I won't... I won't give up.

1237
01:30:18,830 --> 01:30:21,950
Not on our future!

1238
01:30:22,580 --> 01:30:24,420
Future, you say?

1239
01:30:24,580 --> 01:30:27,210
Your consciousnesses are
mismatched and distorted.

1240
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,460
All foolish, ugly, and weak.

1241
01:30:31,210 --> 01:30:35,010
This world is too warped
and has no desirable future.

1242
01:30:35,180 --> 01:30:36,970
I know you feel it to be so as well.

1243
01:30:37,930 --> 01:30:40,100
Shin-sama said so himself.

1244
01:30:40,260 --> 01:30:42,680
That you are a similar entity to us.

1245
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:46,400
Surrender now and
hand over the piece.

1246
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:48,650
Then, why not join us?

1247
01:30:49,310 --> 01:30:51,360
To a brilliant dimension...

1248
01:30:51,530 --> 01:30:53,280
To a future meant
solely for us....

1249
01:30:53,940 --> 01:30:57,200
The world we Prana shall go
is a world of a higher plane.

1250
01:30:57,360 --> 01:31:03,290
An ideal world with neither strife nor hatred nor fear
with all of its people in sync with one another.

1251
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:06,670
I can't go.

1252
01:31:08,580 --> 01:31:12,420
Aigami-kun,
hatred yields nothing.

1253
01:31:21,430 --> 01:31:23,180
Brother...

1254
01:31:25,730 --> 01:31:29,150
You...
You wouldn't understand.

1255
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:33,030
The peaceful day-to-day existence
all of you live and take for granted...

1256
01:31:33,190 --> 01:31:37,150
The fact remains that it's only made possible
through the sacrifice of something else.

1257
01:31:42,740 --> 01:31:44,290
It's gotten late, hasn't it?

1258
01:31:44,700 --> 01:31:45,620
Mm-hmm.

1259
01:31:45,790 --> 01:31:49,170
I sure do hope no one has
caught a hard time because of it.

1260
01:31:49,580 --> 01:31:51,340
For the love of...

1261
01:31:51,590 --> 01:31:53,340
Y'rotten good-for-nothings!

1262
01:31:53,550 --> 01:31:57,840
You go out beggin' the whole day
and this is all you make!?

1263
01:31:58,380 --> 01:32:01,260
No supper for the whole lot of ya!

1264
01:32:03,430 --> 01:32:06,810
Sorry, everyone
It's my fault...

1265
01:32:07,230 --> 01:32:10,440
Diva, it's not your fault.

1266
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:14,150
The other day, you said the
same to me, right?

1267
01:32:14,270 --> 01:32:15,400
Mani...

1268
01:32:15,820 --> 01:32:21,870
And, look, if you squeeze this real hard against your
tummy, you'll forget about how hungry you are a little.

1269
01:32:24,990 --> 01:32:27,370
It's still the same!

1270
01:32:41,340 --> 01:32:44,890
Shut your mouths!
What'ya got to laugh about!?

1271
01:32:45,850 --> 01:32:48,270
If you wanna live t'see another day...

1272
01:32:48,430 --> 01:32:50,350
you'll take yer asses t'sleep!

1273
01:32:51,850 --> 01:32:57,650
During reincarnation, those who will be Prana
choose harsh environments for themselves.

1274
01:32:59,400 --> 01:33:02,910
But, all will be well now.

1275
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:04,780
W-Who the 'ell are you!?

1276
01:33:06,240 --> 01:33:08,870
M-My body won't move!

1277
01:33:11,830 --> 01:33:15,960
I am he who travels dimensions,

1278
01:33:16,340 --> 01:33:18,130
Shadi.

1279
01:33:25,050 --> 01:33:26,430
Big Brother!

1280
01:33:27,060 --> 01:33:28,930
Worry not.

1281
01:33:29,180 --> 01:33:33,020
You shall all meet
in the same place...

1282
01:33:42,360 --> 01:33:43,780
You sonova—!

1283
01:33:43,950 --> 01:33:45,370
As for you...

1284
01:33:45,530 --> 01:33:49,200
a dimension befitting you awaits.

1285
01:33:49,290 --> 01:33:52,160
Nonsense!

1286
01:33:52,290 --> 01:33:53,830
W-What!?

1287
01:34:00,170 --> 01:34:01,840
Shin-sama...

1288
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:06,050
We are the chosen
entities, Prana!

1289
01:34:06,850 --> 01:34:12,020
We shall cast aside this contaminated world and
even being human to travel to a new dimension!

1290
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:13,850
Aigami-kun...

1291
01:34:14,140 --> 01:34:16,480
Now, show yourself once more.

1292
01:34:16,610 --> 01:34:18,570
Indiora Death Volt!

1293
01:34:25,410 --> 01:34:27,950
With your monster's attack power
having increased,

1294
01:34:28,370 --> 01:34:31,410
Gaia Lord powers up!

1295
01:34:36,500 --> 01:34:38,170
No use!

1296
01:34:38,750 --> 01:34:40,460
Cubic Wave!

1297
01:34:41,550 --> 01:34:44,050
Indiora's attack power doubles,

1298
01:34:44,220 --> 01:34:47,550
and your monster's
attack power halves!

1299
01:34:47,800 --> 01:34:49,680
This is no good...

1300
01:34:50,390 --> 01:34:51,430
Yugi!

1301
01:34:51,890 --> 01:34:57,730
Once you are gone, Kaiba's scheme to resurrect
the Pharaoh will also be a bygone memory.

1302
01:34:58,360 --> 01:35:03,280
And then, us Prana will
travel to a new dimension!

1303
01:35:04,490 --> 01:35:06,530
—I've been waiting for this.
—What?

1304
01:35:06,990 --> 01:35:09,950
I've been waiting for this exact moment.

1305
01:35:10,200 --> 01:35:11,580
Permanent Trap!

1306
01:35:11,700 --> 01:35:14,000
Dimension Sphinx!

1307
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:18,750
When there is double or more of a difference in
attack powers between battling monsters,

1308
01:35:19,130 --> 01:35:22,300
it inflicts to you damage
equal to that difference!

1309
01:35:27,260 --> 01:35:29,470
You had a Trap like this...?

1310
01:35:29,590 --> 01:35:32,600
But, the battle
still goes on!

1311
01:35:32,850 --> 01:35:35,600
Double Trap!
Dimension Guardian!

1312
01:35:36,140 --> 01:35:38,650
It will protect Gaia Lord from destruction.

1313
01:35:41,310 --> 01:35:43,320
Such futile resistance!

1314
01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:44,610
That's not all!

1315
01:35:44,900 --> 01:35:48,700
Triple Trap!
Dimension Mirage!

1316
01:35:49,240 --> 01:35:50,740
Triple Trap!?

1317
01:35:50,990 --> 01:35:58,290
Due to my monster not being destroyed,
your monster must attack again!

1318
01:35:58,540 --> 01:36:00,170
T-This can't be...

1319
01:36:00,290 --> 01:36:02,840
This is an infinite loop!

1320
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:04,300
You've been aiming at this...

1321
01:36:04,630 --> 01:36:05,880
That's right.

1322
01:36:06,090 --> 01:36:09,050
This is the one combo that can defeat you...

1323
01:36:10,010 --> 01:36:12,800
The Dimension Trap Pyramid!!

1324
01:36:21,650 --> 01:36:25,610
Aigami-kun, you said all of you are
going to open new doors,

1325
01:36:25,730 --> 01:36:28,900
and travel to an ideal
world in a higher plane.

1326
01:36:29,700 --> 01:36:34,910
Our world may indeed be one
distorted from your perspectives.

1327
01:36:35,410 --> 01:36:38,620
But, this world also has a future.

1328
01:36:39,080 --> 01:36:41,540
I have friends near
and dear who live here.

1329
01:36:43,500 --> 01:36:48,800
And, all of us believe in our futures!!

1330
01:37:07,030 --> 01:37:08,610
Shadi-sama...

1331
01:37:14,530 --> 01:37:16,240
Yugi won...

1332
01:37:16,370 --> 01:37:17,790
—Awright!!
—He did it!

1333
01:37:31,380 --> 01:37:33,090
I've lost...

1334
01:37:33,220 --> 01:37:35,260
To think, me...

1335
01:37:40,390 --> 01:37:42,270
Aigami-kun...

1336
01:37:43,480 --> 01:37:47,190
—Diva lost.
—At this rate, the Pharaoh will be revived!

1337
01:37:48,070 --> 01:37:49,650
Remain calm.

1338
01:37:50,070 --> 01:37:53,610
The rest lies on that individual's decision.

1339
01:37:54,030 --> 01:37:56,740
Man, he sure put us on
the edge of our seats.

1340
01:38:01,540 --> 01:38:03,830
Still, Yugi may have won,
but Bakura-kun, he's...

1341
01:38:08,380 --> 01:38:09,670
That light...

1342
01:38:11,340 --> 01:38:13,430
S-Sorry, coming through!

1343
01:38:15,720 --> 01:38:18,100
Y-You! Bakura!

1344
01:38:18,220 --> 01:38:21,520
Huh? What?
Jonouchi-kun?

1345
01:38:21,850 --> 01:38:23,390
Bakura-kun!

1346
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:25,230
Hey, Yugi!!

1347
01:38:27,190 --> 01:38:27,690
Bakura-kun!

1348
01:38:27,860 --> 01:38:29,610
Yugi!

1349
01:38:29,730 --> 01:38:31,860
The remaining pieces of the Puzzle...

1350
01:38:32,570 --> 01:38:34,360
...are now with you, right?

1351
01:38:37,410 --> 01:38:42,500
Kaiba-kun,  I'm challenging
you as a fellow duelist.

1352
01:38:42,870 --> 01:38:46,920
Unfortunately, the opponent I
need to defeat isn't you.

1353
01:38:47,540 --> 01:38:52,550
Your role is to put those final
pieces into this Millennium Puzzle,

1354
01:38:52,710 --> 01:38:57,140
let the king's spirit take stay in your
prison of a vessel once again,

1355
01:38:57,260 --> 01:39:00,560
and become a prisoner
set to do battle with me.

1356
01:39:00,890 --> 01:39:03,350
Kaiba-kun, will you listen to
what I have to say?

1357
01:39:03,930 --> 01:39:06,770
—The Other Me, he's...
—Enough talk!

1358
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:10,900
Yugi, we will duel.

1359
01:39:11,070 --> 01:39:14,780
Muster all of your
strength and face me!

1360
01:39:23,620 --> 01:39:25,160
—Duel!!
—Duel!!

1361
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,210
It's my turn!
Draw!

1362
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:37,130
I summon Marshmacaron
in defense mode!

1363
01:39:37,470 --> 01:39:41,100
I place two cards face-down
ending my turn.

1364
01:39:41,550 --> 01:39:45,060
Here I come, Yugi the Vessel!

1365
01:39:45,640 --> 01:39:49,020
Show yourself,
Assault Wyvern!

1366
01:39:49,980 --> 01:39:53,440
Now, slice up his monster!

1367
01:39:56,610 --> 01:40:01,160
When destroyed, Marshmacaron can
come back into play split apart!

1368
01:40:03,160 --> 01:40:07,460
In that case, I will use Assault Wyvern's effect...

1369
01:40:07,620 --> 01:40:09,540
...calling forth this monster!

1370
01:40:09,670 --> 01:40:13,750
Come, now!
Blue-Eyes White Dragon!

1371
01:40:15,880 --> 01:40:18,800
In addition, I activate Dragon's Fighting Spirit!

1372
01:40:18,970 --> 01:40:24,310
Blue-Eyes gains a number of attacks equal to
the amount of monsters you control!

1373
01:40:25,060 --> 01:40:29,100
Triple Burst Stream of Annihilation!!

1374
01:40:37,190 --> 01:40:38,490
Trap, activate!

1375
01:40:38,650 --> 01:40:39,820
Dark Horizon!

1376
01:40:40,490 --> 01:40:44,580
By receiving damage, it lets
me summon this monster!

1377
01:40:44,830 --> 01:40:47,540
Come, now! Black Magician!

1378
01:40:50,620 --> 01:40:53,790
I end my turn with this.

1379
01:40:55,500 --> 01:40:56,800
My turn!

1380
01:40:58,510 --> 01:41:01,510
I end my turn... with this!

1381
01:41:02,180 --> 01:41:03,600
Yugi...

1382
01:41:03,850 --> 01:41:06,510
I will now show you why...

1383
01:41:06,680 --> 01:41:09,020
you are just a simple vessel!

1384
01:41:09,180 --> 01:41:12,980
Come, now!
Trap Monster!

1385
01:41:13,100 --> 01:41:15,360
Metamor-Clay Fortress!

1386
01:41:18,070 --> 01:41:21,650
Protect my field
and the Black Magician!

1387
01:41:26,660 --> 01:41:28,240
Damn you...

1388
01:41:28,870 --> 01:41:30,250
My turn!

1389
01:41:30,870 --> 01:41:34,880
Metamor-Clay Fortress,
to attack position!

1390
01:41:47,600 --> 01:41:54,190
It would seem that unless I don't lash you
with the whip of absolute defeat,

1391
01:41:54,350 --> 01:41:57,730
the fetters of the king's
spirit will never come loose!

1392
01:41:58,440 --> 01:42:01,690
Ritual Summon!!
Descend forth!

1393
01:42:01,990 --> 01:42:06,700
Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon!!

1394
01:42:14,580 --> 01:42:17,130
This will end this farce!

1395
01:42:17,710 --> 01:42:22,840
Maximum Burst of Chaos!!

1396
01:42:25,220 --> 01:42:28,600
When Chaos MAX destroys
a defending monster,

1397
01:42:28,720 --> 01:42:32,230
it inflicts double
piercing damage to you!

1398
01:42:32,890 --> 01:42:35,770
There's no escape for you now.

1399
01:42:36,600 --> 01:42:39,650
I will not lose...never.

1400
01:42:40,110 --> 01:42:42,740
I made a promise...with him.

1401
01:42:44,030 --> 01:42:45,610
That's why...

1402
01:42:46,610 --> 01:42:48,530
I can't afford...

1403
01:42:48,660 --> 01:42:50,330
...to lose!

1404
01:42:50,700 --> 01:42:54,120
I summon Apple Magician Girl!

1405
01:42:57,130 --> 01:42:58,130
Kaiba-kun!

1406
01:42:58,250 --> 01:43:00,380
With my monster
allies by my side,

1407
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:02,760
I will defeat you!

1408
01:43:02,960 --> 01:43:06,130
Defeat me, you say!?

1409
01:43:06,260 --> 01:43:10,100
If so, then may you be gone
with your allies in tow!

1410
01:43:10,310 --> 01:43:15,640
When Apple Magician Girl is attacked,
once per turn, it'll summon an ally!

1411
01:43:15,810 --> 01:43:19,310
Come forth, Lemon Magician Girl!

1412
01:43:20,610 --> 01:43:24,990
It then you will be forced
to attack Lemon Magician Girl.

1413
01:43:25,150 --> 01:43:30,620
Which will reduce your monster's
attack power by half!

1414
01:43:31,910 --> 01:43:33,660
In addition,

1415
01:43:33,830 --> 01:43:35,290
Lemon Magician Girl

1416
01:43:35,500 --> 01:43:38,580
has the same effect as Apple Magician Girl.

1417
01:43:38,710 --> 01:43:42,380
Come forth,
Black Magician Girl!

1418
01:43:45,300 --> 01:43:48,640
It reduces by another half!

1419
01:44:00,020 --> 01:44:01,900
But, with this, I'm able...

1420
01:44:03,820 --> 01:44:06,610
...to call forth my ultimate dragon.

1421
01:44:07,530 --> 01:44:09,360
Infinite time...

1422
01:44:09,490 --> 01:44:12,700
O white force hidden within its origin,

1423
01:44:12,830 --> 01:44:16,700
spread your wings which tremble
in the echo of intersecting souls,

1424
01:44:16,830 --> 01:44:19,710
and come forth
from the blue abyss!

1425
01:44:19,830 --> 01:44:23,340
Deep-Eyes White Dragon!!

1426
01:44:23,750 --> 01:44:27,090
Also, by this monster being summoned,

1427
01:44:27,550 --> 01:44:32,390
you will receive the rage of the
dragons in my Cemetery!

1428
01:44:33,180 --> 01:44:35,010
Next, Deep-Eyes!

1429
01:44:35,140 --> 01:44:38,600
Inherit the power of Chaos MAX Dragon!

1430
01:44:40,730 --> 01:44:43,270
Now, time to close
the curtain on this.

1431
01:44:43,400 --> 01:44:45,820
On this duel!!

1432
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:49,740
Trap, activate!

1433
01:44:49,990 --> 01:44:52,530
Magician's Protection!

1434
01:44:53,450 --> 01:44:54,950
This reduces damage to me...

1435
01:44:56,160 --> 01:44:57,830
...by half!

1436
01:45:03,330 --> 01:45:06,000
Damn you!

1437
01:45:08,090 --> 01:45:10,800
That knocks Yugi's
Life Points to just 600.

1438
01:45:11,130 --> 01:45:14,550
If he doesn't do
something this turn, he's...

1439
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:28,990
This Magic card, I'm giving it to you, Kaiba-kun!

1440
01:45:34,030 --> 01:45:38,490
This lets me activate the Magic card,
Magical Contract Door!

1441
01:45:39,250 --> 01:45:41,250
It lets me put a new
monster into my hand,

1442
01:45:41,620 --> 01:45:44,040
which I'll summon here now!

1443
01:45:47,210 --> 01:45:49,090
Raging dragon of blackened steel,

1444
01:45:49,380 --> 01:45:52,260
shatter the lock enclosing the
bounds of the mortal plane,

1445
01:45:52,380 --> 01:45:55,090
and bring forth
destruction to my enemy!

1446
01:45:55,220 --> 01:45:56,430
Come forth!

1447
01:45:56,550 --> 01:45:59,930
Gandora Cross
the Dragon of Destruction!

1448
01:46:02,020 --> 01:46:04,600
I activate Gandora Cross' effect!

1449
01:46:04,900 --> 01:46:08,940
It will destroy all monsters!

1450
01:46:11,400 --> 01:46:17,620
Then, it inflicts damage to you, Kaiba-kun, equal to
the highest attack power out of all of them,

1451
01:46:17,990 --> 01:46:21,370
as well as increase Gandora Cross'
own attack power by that amount!

1452
01:46:24,420 --> 01:46:28,420
In that case, I'm taking your
monster down with it!

1453
01:46:40,260 --> 01:46:43,140
So, you intend on being a
constant thorn in my side, do you?

1454
01:46:43,270 --> 01:46:44,810
Yugi!

1455
01:46:45,900 --> 01:46:47,650
Kaiba-kun...

1456
01:46:48,610 --> 01:46:50,480
The reason I came here...

1457
01:46:51,230 --> 01:46:54,780
...was because I had something
I felt obligated to tell you.

1458
01:46:58,120 --> 01:46:59,660
Yugi!

1459
01:47:29,230 --> 01:47:30,690
This is...

1460
01:47:37,530 --> 01:47:39,280
Save me, Sera!

1461
01:47:39,410 --> 01:47:40,530
Save me!

1462
01:47:43,080 --> 01:47:46,710
Shadi-sama!

1463
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:51,210
The Pharaoh... isn't reviving!

1464
01:47:51,960 --> 01:47:55,720
Atem is no longer within
this Millennium Puzzle.

1465
01:47:56,130 --> 01:47:59,180
I had come to realize that fact,

1466
01:48:00,140 --> 01:48:02,680
the moment I took the
last piece into my hand.

1467
01:48:05,180 --> 01:48:08,560
And you calling me so
that you could fight Atem

1468
01:48:08,850 --> 01:48:11,150
is something I, of course, knew.

1469
01:48:11,270 --> 01:48:12,570
But...

1470
01:48:13,190 --> 01:48:15,070
But, this is...

1471
01:48:16,280 --> 01:48:18,240
...the truth.

1472
01:48:24,200 --> 01:48:26,580
I refuse.

1473
01:48:26,870 --> 01:48:29,080
I refuse to accept this, Yugi!

1474
01:48:29,210 --> 01:48:30,750
I absolutely won't!

1475
01:48:30,880 --> 01:48:32,590
I will defeat you

1476
01:48:32,710 --> 01:48:35,760
and bring forth the
spirit of the king!!

1477
01:48:36,050 --> 01:48:39,590
I send the Magic card in my hand
to the Cemetery to activate this!

1478
01:48:39,880 --> 01:48:41,090
Kaiba-kun!

1479
01:48:41,720 --> 01:48:43,430
The card I'll be
activating...

1480
01:48:43,550 --> 01:48:46,270
...is the one you gave to me!

1481
01:48:46,560 --> 01:48:49,060
Revive the Dead!

1482
01:48:49,640 --> 01:48:53,940
Break through the doors of
the netherworld and revive now!

1483
01:48:54,820 --> 01:48:57,610
This seals your defeat!

1484
01:49:02,030 --> 01:49:03,620
Trap, activate!

1485
01:49:03,740 --> 01:49:05,280
Final Geas!

1486
01:49:05,660 --> 01:49:10,460
This removes all monsters
from our Cemeteries!

1487
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:15,630
And from the removed
monsters, I...

1488
01:49:15,750 --> 01:49:18,970
...will resurrect this monster!

1489
01:49:19,420 --> 01:49:21,300
Yugi...

1490
01:49:22,340 --> 01:49:23,970
Kaiba-kun...

1491
01:49:30,520 --> 01:49:33,060
Go, Black Magician!

1492
01:49:33,190 --> 01:49:35,310
Black Magic!!

1493
01:49:45,830 --> 01:49:46,330
Kaiba-kun!

1494
01:50:01,050 --> 01:50:02,340
That belongs to Aigami-kun...

1495
01:50:06,390 --> 01:50:08,310
The Millennium Ring!?

1496
01:50:09,430 --> 01:50:11,680
What in the world is this?

1497
01:50:11,980 --> 01:50:14,020
What the hell is this!?

1498
01:50:14,150 --> 01:50:17,980
—What is this!?
—This looks bad, doesn't it!?

1499
01:50:18,400 --> 01:50:19,980
Don't tell me this is...

1500
01:50:20,320 --> 01:50:22,190
You humans...

1501
01:50:22,490 --> 01:50:25,700
sure like to repeat yourselves, eh?

1502
01:50:26,070 --> 01:50:27,370
That voice...

1503
01:50:38,590 --> 01:50:40,550
The hell is this?

1504
01:50:41,260 --> 01:50:42,760
What's going on!?

1505
01:51:00,440 --> 01:51:03,190
Is that really Aigami-kun?

1506
01:51:05,950 --> 01:51:06,910
Big Brother!

1507
01:51:08,370 --> 01:51:10,410
Big Brother, what in the world is this!?

1508
01:51:10,700 --> 01:51:13,910
Aah, is that you, Sera?

1509
01:51:14,040 --> 01:51:18,330
So pure...
Immaculate, consciousnesses linked together...

1510
01:51:18,790 --> 01:51:20,250
But, behold!

1511
01:51:20,380 --> 01:51:23,920
At this abhorrent yet beautiful form!

1512
01:51:24,630 --> 01:51:27,300
Our desire is that of
a world of a higher plane!

1513
01:51:27,470 --> 01:51:29,800
However, the price to do so is this!

1514
01:51:30,300 --> 01:51:32,430
I shall now open the doors.

1515
01:51:32,560 --> 01:51:36,020
I shall drag everything into
a dimension of darkness!

1516
01:51:36,440 --> 01:51:37,730
Big Brother!

1517
01:51:37,850 --> 01:51:40,060
Don't tell me...!

1518
01:51:40,190 --> 01:51:43,360
That cube is the door
to a dimensional domain.

1519
01:51:43,480 --> 01:51:45,950
An eighth Millennium Item!?

1520
01:51:46,240 --> 01:51:52,790
Shin-sama had to gather the seven Millennium Items
and send the spirit of the Pharaoh

1521
01:51:52,910 --> 01:51:56,120
to the netherworld in order to
activate the power of the cube.

1522
01:51:57,160 --> 01:52:00,130
So that this sullied world
would dimensionally shift

1523
01:52:00,250 --> 01:52:03,460
and we would build up
a brand new world...

1524
01:52:03,590 --> 01:52:06,130
Yes, that cube...

1525
01:52:06,260 --> 01:52:09,590
was the door leading to a utopia
for the chosen people and them alone.

1526
01:52:09,930 --> 01:52:12,100
Precisely, Sera.

1527
01:52:12,260 --> 01:52:15,310
But, should so much as a drop

1528
01:52:15,430 --> 01:52:19,350
of the beautiful impurity known as hatred
mixes into the dimensional domain...!

1529
01:52:21,110 --> 01:52:22,270
Big Brother...

1530
01:52:24,190 --> 01:52:26,150
Sera!

1531
01:52:28,200 --> 01:52:32,580
Come, I shall make both
of you fall victim as well!

1532
01:52:34,700 --> 01:52:38,870
At this rate, everything is
going to be consumed!

1533
01:52:39,460 --> 01:52:40,370
Yugi!!

1534
01:52:43,040 --> 01:52:44,550
Yugi...

1535
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:48,050
Do you still have the will to fight?

1536
01:52:48,220 --> 01:52:49,510
Kaiba-kun!

1537
01:52:50,130 --> 01:52:52,720
Diva, you and I...

1538
01:52:53,220 --> 01:52:55,560
are going to settle this right now!

1539
01:52:56,220 --> 01:52:58,060
To protect my friends

1540
01:52:59,230 --> 01:53:01,520
I will fight you!

1541
01:53:05,650 --> 01:53:06,730
—Duel!!
—Duel!!

1542
01:53:08,360 --> 01:53:09,740
Intriguing.

1543
01:53:10,150 --> 01:53:14,740
Consider this the start of
a dark dimensional domain duel!

1544
01:53:15,830 --> 01:53:18,750
Darkness! Darkness! Darkness!

1545
01:53:18,910 --> 01:53:21,420
Consume the light
and abscond the world!

1546
01:53:21,670 --> 01:53:22,750
Come forth!

1547
01:53:22,920 --> 01:53:26,590
Crimson Nova the Dark Cubic Lord!

1548
01:53:37,560 --> 01:53:44,060
To think you'd inflict damage to not only us
but to yourself as well at the end of your turn...

1549
01:53:46,730 --> 01:53:50,400
Noticed it, have you?
This is no ordinary duel.

1550
01:53:50,740 --> 01:53:55,280
Your bodies are getting consumed by the dark particles
equal to the amount of Life Points you lost.

1551
01:53:55,490 --> 01:53:58,740
I won't let you have your way!

1552
01:53:58,870 --> 01:54:02,290
Come to me!
Pandemic Dragon!!

1553
01:54:05,250 --> 01:54:08,590
I use my Life Points for his effect,

1554
01:54:08,840 --> 01:54:12,630
decreasing your
monster's attack power!

1555
01:54:15,010 --> 01:54:22,020
Then, Pandemic Dragon takes any monster whose attack power
has fallen lower than its own and destroys it!

1556
01:54:31,530 --> 01:54:36,990
I suppose this means it can't be affected by any effects from
monsters with attack powers lower than its own!?

1557
01:54:39,660 --> 01:54:41,330
My turn!

1558
01:54:41,660 --> 01:54:44,670
I Dimension Summon Silver Gadget!

1559
01:54:48,130 --> 01:54:51,840
Then, Silver Gadget can
summon an ally monster!

1560
01:54:51,960 --> 01:54:53,800
Come, Gold Gadget!

1561
01:54:57,090 --> 01:54:59,850
I end my turn with this!

1562
01:55:00,640 --> 01:55:02,810
That's all?

1563
01:55:03,020 --> 01:55:06,350
In that case,
I'll kill you first!

1564
01:55:06,850 --> 01:55:08,860
When I receive an attack,

1565
01:55:09,020 --> 01:55:13,030
it summons the Trap Monster,
Metalhold the Mobile Fortress!

1566
01:55:13,320 --> 01:55:16,200
Next, I equip my Gadget Monsters to it,

1567
01:55:16,410 --> 01:55:18,370
powering it up!

1568
01:55:19,830 --> 01:55:22,080
Engage the enemy,
Metalhold!

1569
01:55:25,210 --> 01:55:26,870
Foolishness!

1570
01:55:30,710 --> 01:55:36,840
I also call forth two
Crimson Novas to this world!

1571
01:55:39,050 --> 01:55:41,390
Now, take this!

1572
01:55:52,230 --> 01:55:54,740
When Pandemic Dragon is destroyed,

1573
01:55:54,900 --> 01:55:57,530
it decreases the attack
power of another monster.

1574
01:55:57,780 --> 01:56:00,740
You've ended up wringing the
neck of your teammate, have you?

1575
01:56:07,710 --> 01:56:08,750
That's not all!

1576
01:56:08,960 --> 01:56:11,880
When Crimson Nova destroys a monster,

1577
01:56:12,170 --> 01:56:15,050
it's allowed to inflict suffering
upon you both once more!

1578
01:56:17,970 --> 01:56:19,130
Trap, activate!

1579
01:56:19,430 --> 01:56:20,970
Spiritual Sealing Swords of Light!

1580
01:56:21,180 --> 01:56:24,430
It negates your direct attack!

1581
01:56:26,430 --> 01:56:30,350
However, as a cost, I pay...

1582
01:56:30,480 --> 01:56:32,110
2000 Life Points!

1583
01:56:37,240 --> 01:56:38,360
Yugi!

1584
01:56:39,030 --> 01:56:40,030
I'm fine.

1585
01:56:42,660 --> 01:56:47,580
I'm going to shove the both of you
into the dimension of darkness!

1586
01:56:48,710 --> 01:56:50,790
Wicked consciousness, converge!

1587
01:56:50,920 --> 01:56:55,050
To lead the world into a
glimmer-less despair!

1588
01:56:55,210 --> 01:56:58,470
Descend forth now from
the thicket of darkness!

1589
01:56:59,340 --> 01:57:05,140
Crimson Nova Trinity
the Dark Cubic Lord!!

1590
01:57:07,180 --> 01:57:09,180
An attack power of 4500!

1591
01:57:09,310 --> 01:57:11,810
A sacrifice is needed
for a Dark Lord's offense.

1592
01:57:11,940 --> 01:57:15,150
That being your Life Points!

1593
01:57:19,950 --> 01:57:22,450
Now, Yugi!

1594
01:57:22,610 --> 01:57:25,660
Take upon you the
iron blow of the Dark Lord!

1595
01:57:25,780 --> 01:57:28,330
Come, Trap Monster!

1596
01:57:28,450 --> 01:57:30,290
Krystal Avatar!

1597
01:57:34,880 --> 01:57:37,460
I'm the one you'll be facing!

1598
01:57:37,840 --> 01:57:40,470
No!
If you do that, you'll...

1599
01:57:40,630 --> 01:57:46,680
When he's destroyed, it deals damage
to you equal to its attack power!

1600
01:57:54,520 --> 01:57:55,770
Kaiba-kun!

1601
01:57:56,110 --> 01:57:58,030
Kaiba-kun, why!?

1602
01:57:58,150 --> 01:57:59,490
Him.

1603
01:58:01,740 --> 01:58:03,360
Yugi...

1604
01:58:05,030 --> 01:58:05,740
Take this.

1605
01:58:13,620 --> 01:58:15,000
Kaiba-kun!

1606
01:58:15,130 --> 01:58:16,880
Call him.

1607
01:58:17,090 --> 01:58:18,840
Call...

1608
01:58:22,220 --> 01:58:25,390
Kaiba-kun!!

1609
01:58:26,550 --> 01:58:29,640
I will send you to the dimension
of darkness in due time!

1610
01:58:30,270 --> 01:58:33,850
I will inflict upon you the
same pain I have taken!

1611
01:58:34,230 --> 01:58:36,650
Take this!!

1612
01:58:37,560 --> 01:58:39,730
I send Clear Kuriboh to the Cemetery,

1613
01:58:39,900 --> 01:58:42,650
negating any Effect Damage I take!

1614
01:58:45,910 --> 01:58:47,570
You just don't know
when to quit.

1615
01:58:47,740 --> 01:58:51,080
But, by destroying your monster,

1616
01:58:51,250 --> 01:58:54,000
I can attack once more!

1617
01:59:00,170 --> 01:59:01,590
Soon.

1618
01:59:01,800 --> 01:59:05,430
Both you and this world will all
be engulfed by the darkness

1619
01:59:05,930 --> 01:59:10,100
By a world of glimmer-less despairing darkness!

1620
01:59:10,640 --> 01:59:14,600
Now, be gone, Yugi!!

1621
01:59:14,810 --> 01:59:16,230
I...

1622
01:59:16,350 --> 01:59:18,060
I won't lose...

1623
01:59:26,410 --> 01:59:27,490
Draw...

1624
01:59:32,830 --> 01:59:34,410
Guys...

1625
01:59:35,120 --> 01:59:36,750
I'm sorry...

1626
01:59:45,970 --> 01:59:47,590
W-What!?

1627
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:16,830
I-Impossible!

1628
02:00:17,330 --> 02:00:19,580
The Pharaoh of the Netherworld...

1629
02:02:34,090 --> 02:02:35,640
Big Brother...

1630
02:02:36,850 --> 02:02:40,220
Sera, what happened to me?

1631
02:02:40,350 --> 02:02:44,520
Big Brother, our power is no longer...

1632
02:02:44,940 --> 02:02:46,270
Sera...

1633
02:02:46,440 --> 02:02:47,940
Diva...

1634
02:02:48,190 --> 02:02:49,520
Mani.

1635
02:02:49,650 --> 02:02:51,400
It's for the best.

1636
02:02:52,190 --> 02:02:55,320
This is all for the best.

1637
02:02:57,780 --> 02:03:00,580
Yugi, did you manage to see him?

1638
02:03:00,700 --> 02:03:03,410
Mm-hmm, I even talked to him,
albeit briefly.

1639
02:03:03,830 --> 02:03:05,330
—Was he doing well?
—Mm-hmm!

1640
02:03:07,290 --> 02:03:09,000
As it happens, I met him too!

1641
02:03:09,170 --> 02:03:10,840
—Wha!?
—Really!?

1642
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:12,170
I'm envious.

1643
02:03:12,840 --> 02:03:13,920
I knew it!

1644
02:03:14,090 --> 02:03:15,930
I see.

1645
02:03:16,840 --> 02:03:20,310
Seems as though he did
come here, didn't he, Yugi?

1646
02:03:20,680 --> 02:03:21,970
Kaiba-kun!

1647
02:03:22,140 --> 02:03:24,060
I was on the
verge of giving up,

1648
02:03:24,480 --> 02:03:26,560
but you believed, didn't you?

1649
02:03:26,810 --> 02:03:30,150
I have to wonder about that.

1650
02:03:31,020 --> 02:03:33,320
Farewell, Yugi.

1651
02:03:33,570 --> 02:03:38,070
You, too, have been
a proud duelist.

1652
02:03:39,070 --> 02:03:40,450
See you around.

1653
02:03:42,040 --> 02:03:43,700
Kaiba-kun...

1654
02:03:45,370 --> 02:03:48,670
Thank you, really.

1655
02:05:20,430 --> 02:05:22,760
Brother,
are you really going?

1656
02:05:23,890 --> 02:05:26,100
Once this is complete,

1657
02:05:26,310 --> 02:05:29,390
the curtain will rise
to a new kind of duel.

1658
02:05:29,940 --> 02:05:33,480
But, testing that prototype
is far too dangerous!

1659
02:05:34,060 --> 02:05:38,440
We have no idea how dangerous of a system
the Dimensional Domain Emulator can be!

1660
02:05:39,780 --> 02:05:43,280
Mokuba, I leave the rest up to you.

1661
02:05:45,450 --> 02:05:48,910
Brother... Make sure you come back.

1662
02:05:49,290 --> 02:05:53,290
Duel Dimension System, activate!!

1663
02:06:50,180 --> 02:06:51,310
Hmph.
