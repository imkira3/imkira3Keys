Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

<i>Welcome to Zombieland.</i>

5
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:50,479
<i>Back for seconds?
After all this time?</i>

6
00:00:50,481 --> 00:00:52,214
<i>Well, what can I say,
but thank you.</i>

7
00:00:52,216 --> 00:00:53,683
<i>You have a lot of choices</i>

8
00:00:53,685 --> 00:00:55,552
<i>when it comes to
zombie entertainment,</i>

9
00:00:55,554 --> 00:00:57,187
<i>and we appreciate
you picking us.</i>

10
00:00:57,189 --> 00:00:58,653
<i>So you know how Eskimos</i>

11
00:00:58,655 --> 00:01:00,690
<i>have a bunch of words for snow?</i>

12
00:01:04,462 --> 00:01:07,062
<i>The only reason we've survived
the last several years</i>

13
00:01:07,064 --> 00:01:09,464
<i>is we've gotten to know
our bloodthirsty enemies</i>

14
00:01:09,466 --> 00:01:11,001
<i>better than we know ourselves.</i>

15
00:01:11,003 --> 00:01:12,734
<i>In the time since
we last saw you,</i>

16
00:01:12,736 --> 00:01:14,470
<i>zombies have evolved,</i>

17
00:01:14,472 --> 00:01:16,204
<i>so we've given them
different names.</i>

18
00:01:17,608 --> 00:01:19,374
<i>This lady here
is getting chased</i>

19
00:01:19,376 --> 00:01:22,544
<i>by the dumbest Z there is,
what we call a Homer.</i>

20
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:26,948
<i>In a world without YouTube,</i>

21
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:28,585
<i>who isn't entertained
by a Homer?</i>

22
00:01:31,923 --> 00:01:32,923
<i>D'oh!</i>

23
00:01:43,066 --> 00:01:45,434
<i>Unfortunately, for every Homer,</i>

24
00:01:45,436 --> 00:01:48,737
<i>there's a Hawking,
as in Stephen.</i>

25
00:01:48,739 --> 00:01:51,574
<i>Or maybe his slightly less
accomplished sister, Beatrix,</i>

26
00:01:51,576 --> 00:01:53,609
<i>who's still got some brains
left to figure shit out.</i>

27
00:01:53,611 --> 00:01:54,642
Open, open!

28
00:02:17,367 --> 00:02:18,466
<i>Clever girl.</i>

00:02:20,771 --> 00:02:22,339
<i>Okay. Last one.</i>

30
00:02:22,341 --> 00:02:24,176
<i>Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what was that?</i>

31
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:27,243
<i>Okay, all right.
Well, this time,</i>

32
00:02:27,245 --> 00:02:29,313
<i>let's play Name That Zombie.</i>

33
00:02:30,414 --> 00:02:31,414
Hello?

34
00:02:34,151 --> 00:02:35,186
Hello?

35
00:02:41,158 --> 00:02:44,125
<i>The Ninja. Silent, deadly.</i>

36
00:02:44,127 --> 00:02:46,596
<i>The first thing you hear
is your own scream.</i>

37
00:02:54,438 --> 00:02:59,142
<i>You can imagine how thrilled we
were to crack the zombie code.</i>

38
00:02:59,144 --> 00:03:03,144
<i>But life is about more
than just survival.</i>

39
00:03:03,146 --> 00:03:05,748
<i>Ever since we were evicted
from our normal lives,</i>

40
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:09,351
<i>I'd been searching for a place
to put down roots.</i>

41
00:03:09,353 --> 00:03:14,290
<i>My old pal Tallahassee has this
saying, "Go big or go home."</i>

42
00:03:14,292 --> 00:03:17,628
<i>It's not his signature phrase,
but it did give me an idea.</i>

43
00:03:18,695 --> 00:03:20,032
<i>Why not go big...</i>

44
00:03:21,132 --> 00:03:22,465

<i>There are worse places</i>

<i>Casa Blanca.</i>

70
00:05:12,444 --> 00:05:15,243
Wait, why does he get
to be president?

71
00:05:15,245 --> 00:05:17,647
I would have made
a damn fine president.

72
00:05:17,649 --> 00:05:19,949
Kissed a few hands,
shook a few babies.

73
00:05:19,951 --> 00:05:22,551
You would have brought
a real dignity to the office.

74
00:05:22,553 --> 00:05:24,486
- Thank you.
- You don't have what it takes.

75
00:05:24,488 --> 00:05:25,921
- I'll be president.
- Heh!

76
00:05:25,923 --> 00:05:28,156
And I nominate Little Rock
as my VP.

77
00:05:28,158 --> 00:05:30,125
So that means
I get to be president

78
00:05:30,127 --> 00:05:31,695
if you get killed by zombies.

79
00:05:31,697 --> 00:05:33,361
That wasn't
what I was thinking

80
00:05:33,363 --> 00:05:35,932
when I offered you
the position, but yes.

81
00:05:37,168 --> 00:05:38,500
<i>I have this rule:</i>

82
00:05:38,502 --> 00:05:40,135
<i>Enjoy the little things.</i>

83
00:05:40,137 --> 00:05:42,236
<i>Which is what we spent
a lot of time doing</i>

84
00:05:42,238 --> 00:05:44,139
<i>in those early days
at the White House.</i>

85
00:05:44,141 --> 00:05:45,774
<i>And it was a really
special time,</i>

86
00:05:45,776 --> 00:05:47,343
<i>making a house our home.</i>

87
00:05:49,447 --> 00:05:52,815
<i>♪ Happy birthday to... ♪</i>

88
00:05:52,817 --> 00:05:56,185
Shooting up, not to.
All right. Nice!

89
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:03,358
<i>Wichita and I fell into
our own version of domestic bliss.</i>

90
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,464
<i>Well, not quite bliss,
but domesticity to be sure.</i>

91
00:06:07,466 --> 00:06:09,197
Did Abe's blindfold
fall off again?

92
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,233
No, it did not fall off.
I took it off.

93
00:06:11,235 --> 00:06:13,502
It's so creepy.
He stares at us all night.

94
00:06:13,504 --> 00:06:15,370
That stare emancipated
the slaves,

95
00:06:15,372 --> 00:06:16,873
and ended the Civil War.

96
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,875
We should be grateful
he's gawking at us.

97
00:06:18,877 --> 00:06:21,543
Remember what happened the last
time you took the blindfold off?

98
00:06:21,545 --> 00:06:23,646
You made me sleep
on the Lincoln couch?

99
00:06:23,648 --> 00:06:25,016
Mm-hm.

100
00:06:31,255 --> 00:06:32,721
- Is that better?
- Much better.

101
00:06:32,723 --> 00:06:34,188
Good.

102
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:37,026
<i>I love you so much, baby.</i>

103
00:06:37,028 --> 00:06:40,695
You are so gorgeous.

104
00:06:40,697 --> 00:06:42,865
We really need
to find you someone.

105
00:06:42,867 --> 00:06:44,666
That's where you're wrong.

106
00:06:44,668 --> 00:06:47,570
Any romance left in me
belongs to the Beast here.

107
00:06:47,572 --> 00:06:50,875
Okay. Well, then we need
to find someone for me.

108
00:06:52,377 --> 00:06:55,144
Heh, heh, heh,
shouldn't be a problem,

109
00:06:55,146 --> 00:06:57,180
long as you're open
to dating zombies.

110
00:06:57,182 --> 00:07:00,349
So you're saying what? I'm
never gonna find a boyfriend,

111
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:02,551
or get married, have a family?

112
00:07:02,553 --> 00:07:07,423
We're you family, so one
out of three ain't bad.

113
00:07:07,425 --> 00:07:10,392
<i>Little Rock had a
strong desire to leave the nest.</i>

114
00:07:10,394 --> 00:07:12,127
<i>And let's just say Tallahassee</i>

115
00:07:12,129 --> 00:07:14,363
<i>wasn't the most understanding
father figure.</i>

116
00:07:14,365 --> 00:07:15,664
Little Rock!

117
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:17,098
<i>But for better or worse,</i>

118
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,567
<i>we were a family.</i>

119
00:07:18,569 --> 00:07:20,502
<i>And for the first time
since the virus,</i>

120
00:07:20,504 --> 00:07:22,437
<i>we were living somewhere
truly safe,</i>

121
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:25,610
<i>making every day feel like...
Well, like Christmas morning.</i>

122
00:07:26,911 --> 00:07:29,648
Hello? Ho-ho-ho!

123
00:07:30,747 --> 00:07:32,315
Merry Christmas!

124
00:07:32,317 --> 00:07:34,983
- Hey, Tal.
- Santa.

125
00:07:34,985 --> 00:07:37,887
What would you like for
Christmas, little girl? A pony?

126
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:40,723
I'd like you to stop calling me
"little girl."

127
00:07:40,725 --> 00:07:43,959
Well, technically, you are
little and you're a girl.

128
00:07:43,961 --> 00:07:47,762
I am not a little girl, but
do you know what I would like?

129
00:07:47,764 --> 00:07:50,033
I don't give a fuck
what you'd like.

130
00:07:50,035 --> 00:07:52,101
<i>Not to
sound too sentimental,</i>

131
00:07:52,103 --> 00:07:54,769
<i>but those days
at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue</i>

132
00:07:54,771 --> 00:07:57,039
<i>may have been the best days
of my life,</i>

133
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:58,776
<i>and that's counting pre-Z.</i>

134
00:08:00,778 --> 00:08:02,745
Wait a second.

135
00:08:02,747 --> 00:08:05,113
Oh, my God. No.

136
00:08:05,115 --> 00:08:08,617
A first-edition Tolkien,
and you wrote in it.

137
00:08:08,619 --> 00:08:11,753
There's my name, marring this
perfectly preserved paper.

138
00:08:11,755 --> 00:08:13,421
Thank you. And yours too.

139
00:08:13,423 --> 00:08:16,593
You didn't stop.
Thank you so much.

140
00:08:16,595 --> 00:08:18,627
It's a bit touching.

141
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:21,096
Hey, you know, I couldn't
find any wrapping paper,

142
00:08:21,098 --> 00:08:23,332
but don't worry about it.
Just tear it open.

143
00:08:23,334 --> 00:08:25,968
It doesn't matter.
It's only Taft.

144
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:29,404
He was our fattest president,
so there's a lot left over

145
00:08:29,406 --> 00:08:31,406
if you need some wrapping paper.

146
00:08:31,408 --> 00:08:33,711
Columbus, I didn't get
anything from you.

147
00:08:35,113 --> 00:08:37,879
Just what I wanted.
Another gun.

148
00:08:37,881 --> 00:08:42,017
Oh, hey, well, not just any gun.
A Colt .45.

149
00:08:42,019 --> 00:08:45,854
And not just any Colt .45.
The King's.

150
00:08:45,856 --> 00:08:49,992
- England? Denmark? Lichtenstein?
- There's only one king.

151
00:08:49,994 --> 00:08:54,032
Elvis Aaron fucking Presley,
the greatest who ever lived.

152
00:08:55,065 --> 00:08:56,799
The king of kings.

153
00:08:56,801 --> 00:08:59,969
He gave this gun to Nixon
when he visited the White House,

154
00:08:59,971 --> 00:09:03,940
and I give it to you,
locked and loaded.

155
00:09:03,942 --> 00:09:07,376
Yeah, he used to shoot
that Colt in his backyard.

156
00:09:07,378 --> 00:09:09,310
King's palace,
Memphis, Tennessee.

157
00:09:09,312 --> 00:09:11,781
- I tell you about Graceland?
- Only a hundred times.

158
00:09:11,783 --> 00:09:13,516
We'll go there
together someday.

159
00:09:13,518 --> 00:09:15,785
Actually, I'm gonna go
shoot this right now.

160
00:09:15,787 --> 00:09:18,988
I think I saw some Zs
down by the reflecting pool.

161
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:20,723
- I'll go with.
- I'll go by myself.

162
00:09:20,725 --> 00:09:23,325
- It's Christmas.
- It's not fucking Christmas.

163
00:09:23,327 --> 00:09:24,361
It's November 17th.

164
00:09:26,363 --> 00:09:28,730
<i>Little Rock was on the
hunt, all right,</i>

165
00:09:28,732 --> 00:09:30,299
<i>for people her own age.</i>

166
00:09:30,301 --> 00:09:32,167
<i>And the thing is,
they were out there.</i>

167
00:09:32,169 --> 00:09:34,536
<i>We just made it a point
to keep our distance.</i>

168
00:09:34,538 --> 00:09:37,207
<i>Which would suck if you
were the one stuck in the nest.</i>

169
00:09:39,677 --> 00:09:44,613
God, this is really terrifying,
but totally unrealistic.

170
00:09:44,615 --> 00:09:46,181
Hm...

171
00:09:46,183 --> 00:09:47,384
Hey, she'll be fine.

172
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:51,587
Wish she didn't remind me
so much of me.

173
00:09:51,589 --> 00:09:53,355
Hey, come on.
What's wrong with you?

174
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:56,594
Nothing.

175
00:09:58,296 --> 00:10:00,565
All right.
I wasn't gonna do this now.

176
00:10:03,567 --> 00:10:08,337
Okay. Look, you always say that,
like, I play it too safe,

177
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:11,573
and I know we've been in,
like, a bit of a rut lately.

178
00:10:11,575 --> 00:10:15,914
So I thought, what better way
to spice things up than to...

179
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:22,283
Get married?

180
00:10:22,285 --> 00:10:24,853
Yeah, well, I was gonna
say, "Get married!" Yay!

181
00:10:24,855 --> 00:10:27,723
- Is that the Hope diamond?
- I certainly <i>hope</i> it is.

182
00:10:27,725 --> 00:10:30,258
I want you to be Miss Ohio.
Or I guess Mrs. Ohio.

183
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,627
This is unfair.
You know how I feel about this.

184
00:10:32,629 --> 00:10:34,262
- What?
- We've talked about this.

185
00:10:34,264 --> 00:10:37,300
In my limited, but absurdly
painful experience,

186
00:10:37,302 --> 00:10:39,434
married people only do
one thing.

187
00:10:39,436 --> 00:10:42,304
- What, fight? We already do that.
- Get divorced.

188
00:10:42,306 --> 00:10:44,073
I don't see us going that route.

189
00:10:44,075 --> 00:10:46,241
I mean, where would
we find the lawyers?

190
00:10:46,243 --> 00:10:51,280
- I don't know what to say.
- Well, don't say anything. Yet.

191
00:10:51,282 --> 00:10:54,650
- Okay? This was my fault.
- I put you on the spot.

192
00:10:54,652 --> 00:10:58,185
Just think about it, and let me
know whenever you're ready.

193
00:10:58,187 --> 00:11:01,225
Everything will work out
exactly as it's supposed to.

194
00:11:17,274 --> 00:11:19,175
Hey, Buttercup. What's wrong?

195
00:11:19,177 --> 00:11:21,810
Get a little too much eggnog
last night?

196
00:11:21,812 --> 00:11:24,412
- Bad news.
- Bad news?

197
00:11:24,414 --> 00:11:27,849
Well, you know what cancels out
bad news? Good news.

198
00:11:27,851 --> 00:11:30,084
Today is the day
that Wichita says...

199
00:11:30,086 --> 00:11:31,487
Adios.

200
00:11:31,489 --> 00:11:32,524
Hm?

201
00:11:35,793 --> 00:11:40,296
"Dear C and T, we feel
like total shit about leaving.

202
00:11:40,298 --> 00:11:42,500
Sorry, not good at notes.
W and LR."

203
00:11:43,967 --> 00:11:45,901
Well, yeah.
"Not good at notes"

204
00:11:45,903 --> 00:11:47,839
is a pretty huge understatement.

205
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:52,007
He's gonna take
this Beast thing pretty hard.

206
00:11:52,009 --> 00:11:55,243
Well, he should learn
to not get so attached.

207
00:11:55,245 --> 00:11:57,046
Never get attached.
Remember?

208
00:11:57,048 --> 00:11:58,747
That was the problem
with Columbus,

209
00:11:58,749 --> 00:11:59,982
he got too attached.

210
00:11:59,984 --> 00:12:01,584
Well, with Tallahassee,
it's like

211
00:12:01,586 --> 00:12:03,151
- he thinks he's my dad.
- Sure.

212
00:12:03,153 --> 00:12:05,353
But you are lucky
you don't have a boyfriend.

213
00:12:05,355 --> 00:12:07,489
Have you seen him
use Q-tips?

214
00:12:07,491 --> 00:12:10,157
His bedtime routine
took an hour.

215
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:12,027
- Stop.
- What? God, sorry.

216
00:12:12,029 --> 00:12:14,296
- No, stop! Stop!
- Oh!

217
00:12:20,638 --> 00:12:21,638
Namaste.

218
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:25,375
Hi.

219
00:12:28,144 --> 00:12:31,412
<i>Wichita leaving
hit me like a shotgun blast.</i>

220
00:12:31,414 --> 00:12:33,982
<i>So after weeks of feeling sorry
for myself,</i>

221
00:12:33,984 --> 00:12:35,651
<i>I thought a little
retail therapy</i>

222
00:12:35,653 --> 00:12:37,185
<i>might help get her
off my mind.</i>

223
00:12:37,187 --> 00:12:39,153
It's not like
I wanted to start,

224
00:12:39,155 --> 00:12:41,891
wedding planning or anything.
I'm not crazy.

225
00:12:41,893 --> 00:12:44,459
Who wants to get married
in winter? Spring, sure.

226
00:12:44,461 --> 00:12:46,862
- Though my hair and humidity...
- Oh, my God!

227
00:12:46,864 --> 00:12:49,931
Man, I cannot listen
to this shit anymore.

228
00:12:49,933 --> 00:12:53,134
- My God, it's been over a month.
- Yeah, I'm bereft.

229
00:12:53,136 --> 00:12:56,238
Okay, I'm giving you
one more day to mope around,

230
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,142
and then you gotta snap
the fuck out of it.

231
00:12:59,144 --> 00:13:03,145
This whole "finding a home" idea
of yours has made us soft.

232
00:13:03,147 --> 00:13:05,448
And by us, I mean you.

233
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:08,416
It's high time that we nut up
and hit the road again.

234
00:13:08,418 --> 00:13:09,550
And by we, I mean me.

235
00:13:09,552 --> 00:13:10,819
That's where I belong.

236
00:13:10,821 --> 00:13:13,089
On my own. Lone wolf.

237
00:13:13,091 --> 00:13:15,757
- You're welcome to tag along.
- But when they come back,

238
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:17,926
- we won't be here.
- They're never coming back!

239
00:13:22,265 --> 00:13:23,364
I got it.

240
00:13:23,366 --> 00:13:26,133
No, no, no, no, no, no.

241
00:13:26,135 --> 00:13:27,905
Okay. Uh...

242
00:13:32,942 --> 00:13:35,411
It was good. You shot
your alcohol with your gun.

243
00:13:48,993 --> 00:13:50,258
Not bad, huh?

244
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:54,363
Hm, no. Not bad,
but definitely no ZKOTY.

245
00:13:54,365 --> 00:13:57,999
<i>ZKOTY,
that is "Zombie Kill of the Year."</i>

246
00:13:58,001 --> 00:14:00,368
<i>Like a junkie in search
of a higher high,</i>

247
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:03,338
<i>Tallahassee is no longer happy
with Zombie Kill of the Week.</i>

248
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:05,107
<i>Which, if you're keeping score,</i>

249
00:14:05,109 --> 00:14:07,443
<i>just went to Dave Sanderman
of Riverside, Iowa.</i>

250
00:14:07,445 --> 00:14:09,877
<i>You may wanna set down
the Milk Duds for this one.</i>

251
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:11,213
You dead, zombie!

252
00:14:13,951 --> 00:14:15,316
Whoo-whee, pig!

253
00:14:18,188 --> 00:14:20,289
<i>Congratulations, Dave.</i>

254
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:21,956
I never told you this before.

255
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:24,326
In fact, I never told anybody.

256
00:14:24,328 --> 00:14:30,932
But I have Native American blood
coursing through my veins.

257
00:14:30,934 --> 00:14:35,369
- Like, right now?
- Yeah. Right now.

258
00:14:35,371 --> 00:14:40,142
Blackfoot Indian to be exact.
The freest men in history.

259
00:14:40,144 --> 00:14:42,810
Mid-1800s, roamed the plains,

260
00:14:42,812 --> 00:14:46,147
no houses, no laws,
no possessions,

261
00:14:46,149 --> 00:14:49,852
no chiefs to report to,
no wives to listen to.

262
00:14:49,854 --> 00:14:50,955
They listened...

263
00:14:52,255 --> 00:14:54,256
to the call of the buffalo.

264
00:14:55,491 --> 00:14:57,025
And they hunted
those buffalo

265
00:14:57,027 --> 00:15:02,432
by herding them off the cliff
to their deaths.

266
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:08,737
- The great buffalo jump.
- Whoa.

267
00:15:08,739 --> 00:15:12,607
I don't know why I never told
anyone about my Blackfoot blood.

268
00:15:12,609 --> 00:15:15,344
I guess it's
a sacred little secret.

269
00:15:15,346 --> 00:15:18,046
Honestly, you're
the first paleface

270
00:15:18,048 --> 00:15:19,881
I have genuinely trusted

271
00:15:19,883 --> 00:15:22,050
because you've always
been there for me.

272
00:15:22,052 --> 00:15:24,518
You care and you listen.
You really listen...

273
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,421
<i>Unless
you're in a 4D theater,</i>

274
00:15:26,423 --> 00:15:28,656
<i>there is no way
I can communicate</i>

275
00:15:28,658 --> 00:15:30,092
<i>how bad Z-land smells,</i>

276
00:15:30,094 --> 00:15:32,527
<i>which is why I like candles
so much.</i>

277
00:15:32,529 --> 00:15:34,530
<i>Today, maybe
a frosty gingerbread</i>

278
00:15:34,532 --> 00:15:36,098
<i>or a Bahama breeze.</i>

279
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,398
Mmm.

280
00:15:38,501 --> 00:15:40,002
Whoa!

281
00:15:40,004 --> 00:15:43,438
Oh, my God! Please forgive me.
It's fake fur!

282
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,773
Oh, God. I'm so sorry.
I thought you were a...

283
00:15:45,775 --> 00:15:47,943
- You thought I was a zombie?
- Yeah. Of course.

284
00:15:47,945 --> 00:15:49,811
Oh, my God, no.
I don't even eat meat.

285
00:15:49,813 --> 00:15:52,815
I'm a vegetarian.
Vegan, actually. Heh.

286
00:15:52,817 --> 00:15:56,618
- Sorry. Hi, I'm Columbus.
- Madison. Heh-heh.

287
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:59,087
- Oh, hi. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

288
00:15:59,089 --> 00:16:01,757
All right. We're hugging.
So soon. Nice to meet you.

289
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,126
It's nice
to touch a human.

290
00:16:04,128 --> 00:16:05,594
- Don't mind me.
- Oh, hello.

291
00:16:05,596 --> 00:16:07,329
If I can have my body?
Hi, sorry.

292
00:16:07,331 --> 00:16:09,164
This is Tallahassee.
This is Madison.

293
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:11,934
- Madison, Tallahassee.
- Is this your dad?

294
00:16:11,936 --> 00:16:16,405
For shit's sake, slightly older,
better-looking friend.

295
00:16:16,407 --> 00:16:18,672
- Ha, ha, cute.
- You live here?

296
00:16:18,674 --> 00:16:23,112
No, Paul Blart. I live in the
freezer in Pinkberry, mm-hm.

297
00:16:23,114 --> 00:16:26,381
It keeps the zombies out,
though it is awfully chilly.

298
00:16:27,618 --> 00:16:29,951
Do you ever consider
turning it off?

299
00:16:29,953 --> 00:16:32,121
Couldn't find the switch
anywhere.

300
00:16:32,123 --> 00:16:34,222
Just hoping the electricity
would run out.

301
00:16:34,224 --> 00:16:37,292
It's amazing. As long as it
rains, the dams give us power.

302
00:16:37,294 --> 00:16:38,862
Apparently not brain power.

303
00:16:41,264 --> 00:16:43,165
I feel like
you're being super judgy.

304
00:16:43,167 --> 00:16:47,169
Like, I'm getting
a real anti-me vibe off of you.

305
00:16:47,171 --> 00:16:49,137
- Are you?
- Oh, my God. There it was again.

306
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:51,305
- Yeah, I saw it.
- And that's hurtful, okay?

307
00:16:51,307 --> 00:16:53,507
I'm, like, really good
at surviving.

308
00:16:53,509 --> 00:16:55,877
I carry a can of mace
with me everywhere I go.

309
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:58,379
And I can run really, really,
really, really fast.

310
00:16:58,381 --> 00:17:01,117
Probably because I used to do
hot yoga and SoulCycle.

311
00:17:01,119 --> 00:17:04,286
Cardio! Sorry, I do
a lot of cardio too.

312
00:17:04,288 --> 00:17:07,622
It's actually my number one
rule, which is so dorky.

313
00:17:07,624 --> 00:17:10,292
But I have a list of rules
for surviving Zombieland.

314
00:17:10,294 --> 00:17:11,326
- Really?
- Yeah.

315
00:17:11,328 --> 00:17:13,194
- So do I!
- You have rules

316
00:17:13,196 --> 00:17:15,529
- for surviving Zombieland?
- Mine is just mostly

317
00:17:15,531 --> 00:17:17,298
- stay in the freezer.
- Oh.

318
00:17:18,536 --> 00:17:20,134
You know, we set up camp,

319
00:17:20,136 --> 00:17:22,136
like, down the road
at the White House.

320
00:17:23,473 --> 00:17:25,007
The White House?
Oh, my God.

321
00:17:25,009 --> 00:17:26,540
Would you wanna come hang out?

322
00:17:26,542 --> 00:17:28,344
- I would love that.
- Cool.

323
00:17:28,346 --> 00:17:30,312
Okay. How many rules
do you have?

324
00:17:30,314 --> 00:17:33,448
- You wanna know about my rules?
- I wanna hear all of them.

325
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:36,785
- Well, number two is double tap.
- Double tap.

326
00:17:36,787 --> 00:17:39,688
- Double tap, yes.
- Double tap you.

327
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:42,391
- You got me. I'm murdered.
- Ha-ha-ha.

328
00:17:42,393 --> 00:17:44,825
<i>Okay, yeah,
I know what you're thinking.</i>

329
00:17:44,827 --> 00:17:46,562
<i>She's absolutely not my type.</i>

330
00:17:46,564 --> 00:17:48,462
<i>But after Wichita
broke my heart,</i>

331
00:17:48,464 --> 00:17:50,466
<i>I was just excited
to talk to somebody</i>

332
00:17:50,468 --> 00:17:53,369
<i>who smelled like a candle,
and not whiskey and gunpowder.</i>

333
00:17:53,371 --> 00:17:55,036
So Wichita and
Little Rock left.

334
00:17:55,038 --> 00:17:57,538
It was just us guys again.
You know, bachelors.

335
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:00,107
This guy. You know,
making a mess.

336
00:18:00,109 --> 00:18:04,613
Which actually brings me
to rule number 53, Wet-Naps.

337
00:18:04,615 --> 00:18:06,449
- Wow.
- Yeah.

338
00:18:06,451 --> 00:18:10,384
I can't believe that you keep
all this stuff in your head.

339
00:18:10,386 --> 00:18:11,452
Heh, thank you.

340
00:18:11,454 --> 00:18:13,122
- It's amazing.
- Thank you.

341
00:18:13,124 --> 00:18:15,523
- You know, you're really lucky.
- What?

342
00:18:15,525 --> 00:18:19,527
That you found someone so smart
to take care of you.

343
00:18:19,529 --> 00:18:22,965
Most people your age,
they get left all by themselves,

344
00:18:22,967 --> 00:18:25,100
and that can be so sad.

345
00:18:25,102 --> 00:18:28,569
- Yeah. I am so lucky.
- Oh!

346
00:18:30,173 --> 00:18:32,607
Can we have a little summit
in the Oval Office?

347
00:18:32,609 --> 00:18:33,674
Yeah, sure.

348
00:18:33,676 --> 00:18:35,410
You guys, I can't believe

349
00:18:35,412 --> 00:18:39,180
we're in the White House.
This is soy random.

350
00:18:39,182 --> 00:18:42,183
You got to broom this girl.
You know why she's still alive?

351
00:18:42,185 --> 00:18:45,421
Because zombies eat brains,
and she ain't got any!

352
00:18:45,423 --> 00:18:46,955
All right? It doesn't matter

353
00:18:46,957 --> 00:18:49,091
because I'm hitting
the road come sunup.

354
00:18:49,093 --> 00:18:50,691
- Columbus?
- Yes?

355
00:18:50,693 --> 00:18:52,460
Could you maybe give me a tour?

356
00:18:52,462 --> 00:18:55,930
Whoa, this is the Oval Office.

357
00:18:55,932 --> 00:18:57,732
Why do they call it that?

358
00:19:00,671 --> 00:19:01,902
- You ready?
- You ready?

359
00:19:01,904 --> 00:19:03,304
- I'm ready too.
- I'm ready.

360
00:19:03,306 --> 00:19:04,306
- Great.
- Too.

361
00:19:06,676 --> 00:19:08,177
- Let's go.
- He's kind of funny.

362
00:19:08,179 --> 00:19:10,278
Yeah, he's great.
Try not to speak to him.

363
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,479
Okay.

364
00:19:11,481 --> 00:19:13,515
The main attraction.

365
00:19:13,517 --> 00:19:15,150
Ta-da, the Lincoln bedroom.

366
00:19:15,152 --> 00:19:17,585
Believe it or not,
Lincoln never even slept here.

367
00:19:17,587 --> 00:19:20,154
I didn't actually
want a tour, silly.

368
00:19:20,156 --> 00:19:21,856
- What? Oh.
- Hi.

369
00:19:21,858 --> 00:19:23,158
Hi.

370
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,426
Mm-mm, mm-mm.

371
00:19:24,428 --> 00:19:26,861
- What's the matter?
- I don't know.

372
00:19:26,863 --> 00:19:29,731
- Don't you think that I'm pretty?
- Yes, you're very pretty.

373
00:19:29,733 --> 00:19:32,601
You're like, "Girl
in Apartment 406" pretty.

374
00:19:32,603 --> 00:19:34,835
I just... I feel
kind of guilty.

375
00:19:34,837 --> 00:19:37,439
Because of Jesus?

376
00:19:37,441 --> 00:19:39,043
I know ways around that.

377
00:19:43,247 --> 00:19:46,113
- No, no. I... Please. I can't.
- Okay, look,

378
00:19:46,115 --> 00:19:48,016
I've been alone in a freezer
for years.

379
00:19:48,018 --> 00:19:49,852
So either we're doing
this right now,

380
00:19:49,854 --> 00:19:53,788
or I am biting the bullet,
and I am doing the old guy.

381
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:54,790
Okay.

382
00:19:55,959 --> 00:19:58,192
God! You're so hot!
Oh my God!

383
00:19:58,194 --> 00:20:00,694
- It's the humidity.
- Oh, yes!

384
00:20:05,234 --> 00:20:06,269
Holy...

385
00:20:07,671 --> 00:20:11,140
Nutting up, definitely
not shutting up.

386
00:20:11,142 --> 00:20:13,344
Yeah!

387
00:20:27,156 --> 00:20:29,824
- Aah! Oh, shit!
- Oh! Whoa!

388
00:20:29,826 --> 00:20:32,326
Sorry, it's Washington's
old flintlock.

389
00:20:32,328 --> 00:20:35,028
It's a gift to Eisenhower
from the emperor of Japan.

390
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:36,230
Oh, touché.

391
00:20:36,232 --> 00:20:37,699
- I heard a strange noise.
- Yeah.

392
00:20:37,701 --> 00:20:39,834
I've been hearing
some strange noises too.

393
00:20:39,836 --> 00:20:42,069
Oh, yeah. That was us
having sex.

394
00:20:42,071 --> 00:20:44,538
Rule number one.

395
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:47,875
Yeah, maybe rule number 32
for her.

396
00:20:47,877 --> 00:20:48,913
What? Hey.

397
00:20:50,247 --> 00:20:51,749
Okay. Ready?

398
00:20:53,182 --> 00:20:55,216
- Go!
- Okay, let's go. Come on.

399
00:20:55,218 --> 00:20:57,922
Oh, fuck. Shit.

400
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:02,591
- Honey, I'm home.
- Oh, my God, you're back.

401
00:21:02,593 --> 00:21:04,793
I mean, you're back
or whatever. That's cool.

402
00:21:04,795 --> 00:21:06,795
I'm not staying.
I came to get weapons.

403
00:21:06,797 --> 00:21:08,029
At 1:00 in the morning?

404
00:21:08,031 --> 00:21:09,332
Yeah, after a month missing.

405
00:21:10,701 --> 00:21:12,734
Little Rock's gone.

406
00:21:25,548 --> 00:21:28,917
It was great. It felt so good
to be on the move again.

407
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:33,087
We've been having a really
good time here too. Together.

408
00:21:33,089 --> 00:21:36,725
We picked up someone new.
Just a boy.

409
00:21:36,727 --> 00:21:39,094
He's a couple years older
than Little Rock,

410
00:21:39,096 --> 00:21:40,295
and he's from Berkeley.

411
00:21:40,297 --> 00:21:42,363

I know what you're about
to tell me.

418
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,246
She's dating a musician!

419

Come on, don't you think you're,
like, overreacting a little bit?

Yeah. Yeah. No, I could be

You have a beautiful voice.

434
00:23:00,309 --> 00:23:03,177
- Thank you very much. Thank you.
- Yeah.

435
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:07,681
Hey, have you ever heard
of this place, Graceland?

436
00:23:07,683 --> 00:23:10,885
Elvis was a fraud.
He ripped off the black man.

437
00:23:10,887 --> 00:23:15,524
Oh. I... I don't know. I've just
always wanted to go there.

438
00:23:15,526 --> 00:23:18,026
Yeah, me too. Yeah.

<i>I was adamant
it was a dumb idea,</i>

441
00:23:25,201 --> 00:23:28,836
so I did what I never do
with her, I told her no.

442
00:23:28,838 --> 00:23:30,738
You can guess
what happened next.

<i>She left a note,
and then she hit the road.</i>

Does anyone else
get the irony in that? Huh?

445
00:23:49,726 --> 00:23:52,361
I'm so worried, you guys.

446
00:23:52,363 --> 00:23:53,929
They're traveling
all that way,

447
00:23:53,931 --> 00:23:55,830
and all they have
is a fucking guitar.

448
00:23:55,832 --> 00:23:58,566
Yeah, with no intention
of ever swinging it at anything.

449
00:23:58,568 --> 00:24:00,168
You know, because
he's a hippie.

450
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:02,036
She's supposed to be
killing the dead,

451
00:24:02,038 --> 00:24:04,104
- not following them.
- Oh, God.

452
00:24:04,106 --> 00:24:06,039
There's something going on
out there.

453
00:24:06,041 --> 00:24:08,276
- What?
- Berkeley told us

454
00:24:08,278 --> 00:24:10,077
about this new kind of zombie

455
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:12,581
that's stronger, and faster,

456
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:16,217
and deadlier and better
adapted to the hunt.

457
00:24:16,219 --> 00:24:18,452
I'm sorry, but that
sounds totally made up.

458
00:24:18,454 --> 00:24:20,654
If you want us to come
with you, just ask us.

459
00:24:20,656 --> 00:24:23,157
Honestly, I just came back
for guns and ammunition.

460
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:24,959
Come on. Stop begging.
We'll do it.

461
00:24:24,961 --> 00:24:26,628
You know, this is
all your fault.

462
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:28,395
- Me?
- If you hadn't pushed her away...

463
00:24:28,397 --> 00:24:29,765
Well,
not exactly, no.

464
00:24:29,767 --> 00:24:31,132
I didn't just run
from him.

465
00:24:31,134 --> 00:24:32,470
She ran from you too.

466
00:24:34,136 --> 00:24:35,271
What?

467
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,606
You... You mean well,
but you're...

468
00:24:39,608 --> 00:24:40,944
kind of overbearing.

469
00:24:42,144 --> 00:24:44,578
Oh, right.
I'm overbearing?

470
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,113
She's not a kid
anymore.

471
00:24:46,115 --> 00:24:48,082
Yeah, she's not a kid,
but I don't know,

472
00:24:48,084 --> 00:24:49,717
it sounds like
she needs us.

473
00:24:49,719 --> 00:24:51,855
Whatever.
We're gonna go get her.

474
00:24:52,955 --> 00:24:55,157
We ride at dawn.

475
00:24:55,159 --> 00:24:57,628
Once she's safe,
I'm going my own way.

476
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:03,832
So no goodbye,
just like...

477
00:25:03,834 --> 00:25:05,834
- Yeah, I'm terrible at notes.
- A lame note.

478
00:25:05,836 --> 00:25:08,471
Yeah, I know. You mentioned
that in the note.

479
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:12,041
Uh, I, uh...

480
00:25:13,542 --> 00:25:16,879
I might have overreacted
a little bit.

481
00:25:16,881 --> 00:25:19,013
I mean, the proposal
kind of spooked me.

482
00:25:19,015 --> 00:25:20,448
Mm-hm.

483
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:22,253
You know what
I'm trying to say.

484
00:25:23,953 --> 00:25:25,819
Oh, God. I'm sorry.

485
00:25:25,821 --> 00:25:27,889
You know how hard it is
for me to say that

486
00:25:27,891 --> 00:25:30,225
because I hate women
who are always apologizing

487
00:25:30,227 --> 00:25:32,626
for things they have
no reason to apologize for.

488
00:25:32,628 --> 00:25:37,567
But in this particular instance,
I actually am really sorry.

489
00:25:39,669 --> 00:25:42,804
Well, thank you.
That actually does mean a lot.

490
00:25:42,806 --> 00:25:45,039
I don't know.
Maybe this could be like a...

491
00:25:45,041 --> 00:25:46,644
Like a turning point for us.

492
00:25:47,711 --> 00:25:49,643
Yeah, maybe.

493
00:25:49,645 --> 00:25:52,514
Columbus,
you coming back to bed?

494
00:25:57,721 --> 00:25:58,853
Wow.

495
00:25:58,855 --> 00:26:01,021
Oh... Oh, boy.

496
00:26:01,023 --> 00:26:02,759
I mean, wow!

497
00:26:05,327 --> 00:26:09,767
Glad we had this little talk.
Real turning point.

498
00:26:11,734 --> 00:26:12,802
Hi.

499
00:26:15,538 --> 00:26:18,241
- Is that your sister?
- Oh, fuck.

500
00:26:22,746 --> 00:26:24,446
You definitely
don't need any help.

501
00:26:24,448 --> 00:26:25,613
- No, I've got it.
- Cool.

502
00:26:25,615 --> 00:26:27,082
The Beast is back.

503
00:26:27,084 --> 00:26:30,684
I cannot wait to get my hands
behind the...

504
00:26:30,686 --> 00:26:34,421
What the fuck?

505
00:26:34,423 --> 00:26:37,392
No, no, no, no, no.

506
00:26:37,394 --> 00:26:41,930
No way is that GD minivan
even sniffing at Graceland,

507
00:26:41,932 --> 00:26:45,533
home to perhaps
America's finest automobile,

508
00:26:45,535 --> 00:26:49,171
Elvis' 1955 Fleetwood Series 60.

509
00:26:49,173 --> 00:26:53,874
No. You know, it takes a real
man to drive a pink Cadillac.

510
00:26:55,077 --> 00:26:58,180
Might make that
a rule of my own.

511
00:26:58,182 --> 00:26:59,680
On second thought, fuck that,

512
00:26:59,682 --> 00:27:01,716
rules are for pussies.
Nothing personal.

513
00:27:01,718 --> 00:27:03,719
How could it not be?
That's my thing.

514
00:27:03,721 --> 00:27:05,452
Yeah, you're right.
It was personal.

515
00:27:05,454 --> 00:27:07,055
Yeah. It's gonna be okay.

516
00:27:07,057 --> 00:27:08,690
<i>Even Tallahassee knows</i>

517
00:27:08,692 --> 00:27:10,123
<i>beggars can't be choosers.</i>

518
00:27:10,125 --> 00:27:12,193
<i>Vehicles with working batteries
and parts</i>

519
00:27:12,195 --> 00:27:13,961
<i>are way scarcer nowadays,</i>

520
00:27:13,963 --> 00:27:16,463
<i>thanks to years
of neglect and decline.</i>

521
00:27:16,465 --> 00:27:17,632
Breakaway mirror.

522
00:27:17,634 --> 00:27:19,467
<i>We can't be so picky anymore.</i>

523
00:27:19,469 --> 00:27:21,669
- Clear.
- What? Oh, okay.

524
00:27:21,671 --> 00:27:23,603
- Booyah.
- Okay.

525
00:27:23,605 --> 00:27:25,041
Heh!

526
00:27:28,311 --> 00:27:30,745
- This never happened.
- I'll get the door.

527
00:27:30,747 --> 00:27:32,983
I got it.
I'm gonna lay in the back.

528
00:27:34,351 --> 00:27:36,249
- Oh, catch.
- Oh!

529
00:27:36,251 --> 00:27:38,986
Shoot. Heh, I got it!

530
00:27:38,988 --> 00:27:42,489
What in the butt?

531
00:27:42,491 --> 00:27:44,325
- Ah, shit.
- What?

532
00:27:44,327 --> 00:27:45,593
- Hi!
- Hi.

533
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:48,796
Are we dropping her off

534
00:27:48,798 --> 00:27:50,498
at an animal shelter
or something?

535
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,798
She's a human being.

536
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,801
We're not gonna
leave her here alone.

537
00:27:53,803 --> 00:27:56,738
We can't
just leave Columbus' girlfriend.

538
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:58,171
Okay.

539
00:27:58,173 --> 00:27:59,474
A minivan. Nice.

540
00:27:59,476 --> 00:28:00,807
I'm not gonna feel guilty.

541
00:28:00,809 --> 00:28:02,410
You left me in
the harshest way.

542
00:28:02,412 --> 00:28:03,612
You recovered quickly.

543
00:28:03,614 --> 00:28:05,613
- Well, thank you.
- Can you help me?

544
00:28:05,615 --> 00:28:07,114
- I got it.
- Okay.

545
00:28:07,116 --> 00:28:08,815
- It's just, like, heavy.
- No problem.

546
00:28:08,817 --> 00:28:10,584
- Thank you.
- Go ahead, get in.

547
00:28:10,586 --> 00:28:12,722
Okay. You are so nice.

548
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:24,833
Ah, Makkapitew, Askuwheteau,
Sunukkuhkau...

549
00:28:24,835 --> 00:28:26,366
Is he having a seizure?

550
00:28:26,368 --> 00:28:28,835
I'm trying out
Blackfoot names,

551
00:28:28,837 --> 00:28:31,573
so full shushy or you
go back in your mall fridge.

552
00:28:31,575 --> 00:28:33,007
Okay.

553
00:28:33,009 --> 00:28:35,910
Oh, I didn't tell you.
We met at the mall.

554
00:28:35,912 --> 00:28:39,180
- Mm.
- Yeah. I was living there.

555
00:28:39,182 --> 00:28:41,083
Like <i>Dawn of the Dead.</i>

556
00:28:41,085 --> 00:28:44,552
Last I checked,
it's the post-acropolis.

557
00:28:44,554 --> 00:28:48,488
It was so sad when
the acropolis struck.

558
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:50,025
Yeah, I know.

559
00:28:50,027 --> 00:28:52,392
Madison, can you remind me,
when we first met,

560
00:28:52,394 --> 00:28:54,527
did you point a gun at me
and steal my car?

561
00:28:54,529 --> 00:28:57,164
No. When we first met,

562
00:28:57,166 --> 00:28:59,500
I told you
you were really smart.

563
00:28:59,502 --> 00:29:03,203
- Oh, yeah.
- And then I slept with you.

564
00:29:03,205 --> 00:29:04,671
That's right. You did.

565
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:10,143
Road trip! Here we go!

566
00:29:10,145 --> 00:29:12,380
This is gonna be a long drive.

567
00:29:21,423 --> 00:29:24,359
I love the smell of
gunpowder in the morning.

568
00:29:24,361 --> 00:29:26,830
Eh, I'm more of
a patchouli oil guy myself.

569
00:29:28,198 --> 00:29:32,199
You don't...
You don't have weed, do you?

570
00:29:32,201 --> 00:29:35,536
I've always wanted to smoke
way too much weed.

571
00:29:35,538 --> 00:29:37,138
Do I look like
the type of person

572
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:39,373
that would have weed on me?

573
00:29:39,375 --> 00:29:42,242
Oh, no. I w... That...
I'm sorry, that was...

574
00:29:42,244 --> 00:29:44,612
- Boom, yeah.
- Ha! Oh.

575
00:29:44,614 --> 00:29:47,082
- Of course I do. Oh, I love weed.
- You got me there.

576
00:29:47,084 --> 00:29:49,817
- Look. I mean, look at me.
- Yeah.

577
00:29:49,819 --> 00:29:54,891
I wanted to say it's really nice
to have another woman around.

578
00:29:56,593 --> 00:29:57,758
Yeah.

579
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,928
Like to talk
about relationships.

580
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:03,133
- Recipes.
- Rings.

581
00:30:04,232 --> 00:30:06,468
Oh, my God.

582
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:08,071
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, shit.

583
00:30:09,571 --> 00:30:12,440
I know! I found it
in the bedside drawer.

584
00:30:12,442 --> 00:30:14,775
I think it belonged
to the first lady or...

585
00:30:14,777 --> 00:30:16,545
You know what?
I think you're right.

586
00:30:16,547 --> 00:30:19,412
It did belong
to the first lady.

587
00:30:19,414 --> 00:30:21,915
Well, I think it was given
to the first lady,

588
00:30:21,917 --> 00:30:23,616
but she heartlessly
rejected it.

589
00:30:23,618 --> 00:30:27,822
What kind of idiot would
turn down a ring like this?

590
00:30:27,824 --> 00:30:31,992
Maybe an idiot who didn't
wanna be weighed down.

591
00:30:31,994 --> 00:30:34,362
Anchored. Chained
to something immobile.

592
00:30:34,364 --> 00:30:35,462
Hmm...

593
00:30:38,434 --> 00:30:41,803
- Oh, shit. Are you okay?
- Oh, shoot!

594
00:30:41,805 --> 00:30:43,470
Forgot the seatbelt rule.

595
00:30:43,472 --> 00:30:45,806
So she knows the rules?

596
00:30:45,808 --> 00:30:47,607
Yeah, I told her
just a few of them.

597
00:30:47,609 --> 00:30:51,345
- Seventy-three. Are there more?
- Nope, that's it.

598
00:30:51,347 --> 00:30:53,480
- I gotta check this out.
- You guys have spent

599
00:30:53,482 --> 00:30:55,083
a lot of time together, huh?

600
00:30:55,085 --> 00:30:56,651
That's sweet.

601
00:30:56,653 --> 00:30:59,520
You're cute together.
I like it.

602
00:30:59,522 --> 00:31:01,354
Oh!

603
00:31:09,265 --> 00:31:10,534
This looks promising.

604
00:31:17,874 --> 00:31:20,507
He's so flexible.

605
00:31:20,509 --> 00:31:22,977
That's what's so great
about him. He's very bendy.

606
00:31:22,979 --> 00:31:25,345
Ohio, whenever
you're done with that...

607
00:31:25,347 --> 00:31:26,450
What? Yeah.

608
00:31:29,219 --> 00:31:30,651
Ah!

609
00:31:30,653 --> 00:31:32,186
What? No. No, no, no.

610
00:31:32,188 --> 00:31:33,554
No way. Nonstarter.

611
00:31:33,556 --> 00:31:35,588
You know how I feel
about clowns.

612
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:37,491
- No, not that.
- What?

613
00:31:37,493 --> 00:31:39,862
- That.
- Oh.

614
00:31:41,832 --> 00:31:43,901
- Looks good.
- Mm.

615
00:31:45,067 --> 00:31:46,767
- Can I see?
- Hm?

616
00:31:46,769 --> 00:31:48,102
Can I see?

617
00:31:48,104 --> 00:31:51,171
Yeah. Here you go. Yeah.

618
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:58,345
- The old man is so tiny.
- Can you see that?

619
00:31:59,715 --> 00:32:01,850
What's-his-name,
you're so tiny.

620
00:32:01,852 --> 00:32:03,218
Now you're not.
Now you are.

621
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,651
Now you're not. Now you are.

622
00:32:04,653 --> 00:32:06,821
Now you're not. Now you are.
Now you're not.

623
00:32:06,823 --> 00:32:08,721
Tiny. Big. Tiny!

624
00:32:08,723 --> 00:32:12,092
- She is adorable.
- She is. I'm lucky.

625
00:32:12,094 --> 00:32:13,995
Tiny. Big. Tiny.

626
00:32:15,699 --> 00:32:17,431
You're overreacting, okay?

627
00:32:17,433 --> 00:32:18,999
Madison's not
a real thing.

628
00:32:19,001 --> 00:32:21,768
It was just circumstance.
It was a lack of options.

629
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:23,671
You could say
the same thing about us.

630
00:32:23,673 --> 00:32:26,340
- What?
- Circumstance, lack of options.

631
00:32:26,342 --> 00:32:27,875
Really? You really think that?

632
00:32:27,877 --> 00:32:29,710
Whereas you two seem
like soul mates.

633
00:32:29,712 --> 00:32:31,478
Destined to share
deep thoughts.

634
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,815
Maybe you're right,
maybe we are soul mates.

635
00:32:33,817 --> 00:32:36,484
Because she's nice, all right?
And I'm nice.

636
00:32:36,486 --> 00:32:38,119
And you're not.
You're mean.

637
00:32:38,121 --> 00:32:41,122
- Whatever. I'm not mean.
- Yeah, you're kind of mean.

638
00:32:41,124 --> 00:32:43,390
Well, my sister is missing.
She could be dead.

639
00:32:43,392 --> 00:32:45,426
You're screwing
some Forever 21-year-old.

640
00:32:45,428 --> 00:32:47,161
So if I wanna be mean,
I'll be mean.

641
00:32:47,163 --> 00:32:48,830
I don't have
the right shoes.

642
00:32:48,832 --> 00:32:51,565
Oh, you could borrow
a pair of my strappy sandals.

643
00:32:51,567 --> 00:32:52,635
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

644
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:58,205
Kidding. You... She was ki...
You guys are all very sarcastic.

645
00:32:58,207 --> 00:33:01,374
Yeah, they're not nice people.
Sorry. Just try to ignore them.

646
00:33:01,376 --> 00:33:04,312
- Yeah. Yeah. Ignore us.
- Please, God, ignore us.

647
00:33:04,314 --> 00:33:05,849
Ah, see? Mean.

648
00:33:08,718 --> 00:33:10,884
All right!

649
00:33:10,886 --> 00:33:12,553
This is what
I'm talking about.

650
00:33:12,555 --> 00:33:14,956
We're finally gonna be
riding in style.

651
00:33:14,958 --> 00:33:18,459
I partied with 3 Doors Down
in one of these. It was so...

652
00:33:18,461 --> 00:33:20,393
Oh, shit.

653
00:33:25,067 --> 00:33:26,165
What?

654
00:33:27,336 --> 00:33:28,936
Man, we're getting
good at this.

655
00:33:28,938 --> 00:33:30,971
- Columbus.
- Tallahassee.

656
00:33:30,973 --> 00:33:32,474
- The hood is 12 o'clock.
- Yes.

657
00:33:32,476 --> 00:33:34,378
Trunk is 6. You're our eyes.

658
00:33:35,878 --> 00:33:37,878
Hey, don't worry,
you guys.

659
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,980
They are much more afraid of us
than we are of them.

660
00:33:40,982 --> 00:33:43,717
God, that is not even
remotely true.

661
00:33:43,719 --> 00:33:46,353
- Well, what do I do?
- You know how cheerleaders

662
00:33:46,355 --> 00:33:47,788
- form a pyramid?
- Yeah.

663
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:49,224
And the three on the bottom

664
00:33:49,226 --> 00:33:51,124
- anchor the pyramid?
- Oh, yeah.

665
00:33:51,126 --> 00:33:54,128
I don't give a shit what you do,
just stay out of my way.

666
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:56,529
Okay, 8 o'clock. Eight o'clock.

667
00:33:56,531 --> 00:33:59,834
Did you say the front was 12?
Oh, fuck me. Sorry. Two o'clock.

668
00:33:59,836 --> 00:34:02,803
Eleven! Eleven! Seven-thirty!

669
00:34:02,805 --> 00:34:04,939
Six o'clock. Six!

670
00:34:04,941 --> 00:34:06,774
I'll get 6.

671
00:34:07,876 --> 00:34:09,209
Uh, shit. One-fifteen.

672
00:34:09,211 --> 00:34:10,211
One-thirteen, 1:20.

673
00:34:10,213 --> 00:34:11,612
It's moving that way.

674
00:34:11,614 --> 00:34:13,380
Why is everyone
shouting numbers?

675
00:34:13,382 --> 00:34:14,815
Eleven!

676
00:34:14,817 --> 00:34:15,851
- Twelve!
- Six!

677
00:34:17,554 --> 00:34:19,186
Two o'clock!

678
00:34:19,188 --> 00:34:20,188
Eight.

679
00:34:21,557 --> 00:34:23,527
- Six o'clock.
- Shit.

680
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:28,598
One o'clock. Six-thirty.

681
00:34:30,733 --> 00:34:32,432
Ten! Eight!

682
00:34:33,503 --> 00:34:34,668

683
00:34:35,737 --> 00:34:36,836
Shit!

684
00:34:42,545 --> 00:34:45,246
- Narsty!
- Thank you.

685
00:34:45,248 --> 00:34:46,246
You're welcome.

686
00:34:46,248 --> 00:34:48,182
One o'clock! Two-thirty.

687
00:34:48,184 --> 00:34:49,286
Three! One!

688
00:34:51,086 --> 00:34:52,389
Okay. I'll get 3.

689
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:55,389
Right on time, Columbus.

690
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,458
One o'clock! Ten-thirty!

691
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:02,896

692
00:35:02,898 --> 00:35:04,599
Actually, it's a Homer.

699
00:35:26,922 --> 00:35:28,224
All right. Settle down.

700
00:35:31,893 --> 00:35:35,595
- Hey, Tal, 1 o'clock.
- Pardon me, Pop-Tart.

701
00:35:35,597 --> 00:35:37,298
Not quite done yet.

702
00:35:46,574 --> 00:35:47,909

In moments of great dishonor
such as this,

747
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:56,095
ancient samurai warriors
were required to commit seppuku,

Back on the road, yay!

753
00:39:27,764 --> 00:39:30,097
I've always wanted
to start a business

754
00:39:30,099 --> 00:39:33,766
where strangers drive strangers
around in their car

755
00:39:33,768 --> 00:39:35,836
- for money.
- Mm.

756
00:39:35,838 --> 00:39:38,972
Let's say you were really
drunk and needed a ride home.

757
00:39:38,974 --> 00:39:40,474
You'd just get online

758
00:39:40,476 --> 00:39:42,443
and hop right in
with a stranger.

759
00:39:42,445 --> 00:39:45,077
And they'd take you
anywhere you wanna go.

760
00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:47,648
- Oh, yeah. Who then kills you.
- Yeah. Ha, ha!

761
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:50,418
They'd have gum
or, like, lollipops.

762
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:52,186
That was what my parents
taught me.

763
00:39:52,188 --> 00:39:55,889
They were like, "If a stranger
offers you candy or gum,

764
00:39:55,891 --> 00:39:57,358
get in their car."
Great idea.

765
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,059
If they try to murder you,

766
00:39:59,061 --> 00:40:01,195
you can have a system
so you can rate them.

767
00:40:01,197 --> 00:40:03,898
If they try to murder you,
like, "You get zero points."

768
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:07,367
But if they don't try to murder
you, "You get five points."

769
00:40:07,369 --> 00:40:09,836
Madison, I think it is
a very good idea.

770
00:40:09,838 --> 00:40:12,373
That's... No, I cannot
see that going wrong.

771
00:40:12,375 --> 00:40:15,409
All I'm saying is the
taxi industry was very flawed.

772
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:20,715
- Mm, oop...
- Are you okay?

773
00:40:20,717 --> 00:40:23,483
I think I'm, like, hot.
I'm hot.

774
00:40:23,485 --> 00:40:25,017
- Yeah?
- Mm-hm.

775
00:40:25,019 --> 00:40:27,387
I'm used to being in
the freezer all the time.

776
00:40:27,389 --> 00:40:30,257
- Get this off.
- Yeah. Sure. That makes sense.

777
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:39,534
I feel funny. My tongue...

778
00:40:39,536 --> 00:40:41,501
My tongue... My tongue...

779
00:40:41,503 --> 00:40:43,202
Boss?
You're gonna wanna pull over.

780
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:45,639
- No.
- Pull over.

781
00:40:45,641 --> 00:40:47,039
We're making good progress.

782
00:40:47,041 --> 00:40:48,041
- Ugh!
- Pull over!

783
00:40:48,043 --> 00:40:49,709
- Yeah.
- Okay. Okay.

784
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:58,552
- Oh.
- Oh.

785
00:40:58,554 --> 00:40:59,586
Chunkage.

786
00:40:59,588 --> 00:41:01,487
Maybe she'll pull through.

787
00:41:01,489 --> 00:41:04,124
What? You are the one
who says "don't take chances."

788
00:41:06,295 --> 00:41:09,298
So who wants do the honors?

789
00:41:10,632 --> 00:41:13,333
I mean, personally,
I wouldn't mind,

790
00:41:13,335 --> 00:41:16,704
but I don't want
you guys calling me selfish.

791
00:41:16,706 --> 00:41:19,907
Hey, come on. She is a living,
thinking being. Okay?

792
00:41:19,909 --> 00:41:21,441
She's a living being.

793
00:41:21,443 --> 00:41:25,979
Look, I know you guys
are in love or whatever,

794
00:41:25,981 --> 00:41:28,414
but in two minutes,
she's gonna become a:

795
00:41:30,318 --> 00:41:34,655
A zombie, not a velociraptor.
And it's the right thing to do.

796
00:41:34,657 --> 00:41:38,159
If you love something,
you shoot it in the face

797
00:41:38,161 --> 00:41:40,894
so it doesn't become
a flesh-eating monster.

798
00:41:40,896 --> 00:41:42,329
I know.

799
00:41:42,331 --> 00:41:44,398
She's making a good point.

800
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:50,670
Maybe it's time for you to be
the Brave Little Toaster.

801
00:41:55,545 --> 00:41:57,811
<i>They say when
something bad happens,</i>

802
00:41:57,813 --> 00:41:59,546
<i>you have three choices:</i>

803
00:41:59,548 --> 00:42:03,018
<i>Let it define you, destroy you,
or strengthen you.</i>

804
00:42:06,688 --> 00:42:08,891
<i>Time to teach Lennie
about the rabbits.</i>

805
00:42:13,628 --> 00:42:15,729
No! Don't come with me!
Don't come with me!

806
00:42:15,731 --> 00:42:17,530
Madison, Madison, please.

807
00:42:17,532 --> 00:42:19,867
- Madison, please. Please, please.
- Don't hurt me!

808
00:42:19,869 --> 00:42:21,369
- No, no, no!
- Wait. Listen to me!

809
00:42:21,371 --> 00:42:22,603
- Please. Wait.
- No, no, no!

810
00:42:22,605 --> 00:42:24,771
- Madison, just wait.
- I'm a monster.

811
00:42:24,773 --> 00:42:26,539
- I'm a monster.
- Please, please.

812
00:42:26,541 --> 00:42:29,175
Listen. I realize we don't
know each other that well.

813
00:42:29,177 --> 00:42:31,679
I mean, well, we do
in the biblical sense, yes.

814
00:42:31,681 --> 00:42:33,715
But I think you're
a really great person.

815
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:37,950
Well, not now.

816
00:42:40,222 --> 00:42:42,155
I'm sorry.

817
00:42:55,003 --> 00:42:57,204
Thanks.

818
00:42:57,206 --> 00:42:59,039
Can we just, uh...

819
00:42:59,041 --> 00:43:01,074
I'm so sorry.

820
00:43:01,076 --> 00:43:03,342
All right. Just...
Come on, come on, let's go.

821
00:43:14,255 --> 00:43:16,255
I'm not gonna lie and say

822
00:43:16,257 --> 00:43:18,961
that I'm broken up
about it, but, um...

823
00:43:20,563 --> 00:43:22,697
- I am sorry.
- Yeah.

824
00:43:22,699 --> 00:43:24,764
- She didn't deserve that.
- Thanks, man.

825
00:43:24,766 --> 00:43:29,472
He's right. That's a terrible
way to go, even for...

826
00:43:30,706 --> 00:43:32,938
- It's....
- Oh, come on. It's Madison.

827
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:34,275
- You know that.
- Madison!

828
00:43:34,277 --> 00:43:36,342
You know that, okay?
Her name is Madison.

829
00:43:36,344 --> 00:43:39,579
Or her name was Madison.
And she was a real person, okay?

830
00:43:39,581 --> 00:43:41,715
She had, you know,
complex feelings

831
00:43:41,717 --> 00:43:43,516
and emotions and interests.

832
00:43:43,518 --> 00:43:48,621
She liked dolphins and rainbows,
you know? And double rainbows.

833
00:43:48,623 --> 00:43:51,358
- I'm agreeing. It's sad.
- Okay.

834
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,092
That is obviously not
what I wanted.

835
00:43:53,094 --> 00:43:55,795
- What is it that you do want?
- I wanna find my sister.

836
00:43:55,797 --> 00:43:56,963
Me too.

837
00:43:56,965 --> 00:43:58,664
- Good.
- Good.

838
00:43:58,666 --> 00:44:01,133
- Good. Great. Awesome.
- Great, in fact. Great.

839
00:44:01,135 --> 00:44:03,003
This is gonna be
a long drive.

840
00:44:14,182 --> 00:44:15,749
This is it.

841
00:44:15,751 --> 00:44:18,952
Hey, little buddy,
don't be cruel to me

842
00:44:18,954 --> 00:44:21,157
for waking you up,
but we're here.

843
00:44:22,291 --> 00:44:25,124
Oh. Oh, my God.

844
00:44:25,126 --> 00:44:26,559
Oh, my God.

845
00:44:28,898 --> 00:44:31,398
Every choice I've ever
made in my life

846
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:34,333
has been leading me
to this moment right here,

847
00:44:34,335 --> 00:44:37,304
right now,
3764 Elvis Presley Boulevard.

848
00:44:37,306 --> 00:44:40,773
I feel like a 1954 teenybopper.

849
00:44:40,775 --> 00:44:41,844
And here comes...

850
00:44:44,447 --> 00:44:45,447
No.

851
00:44:48,282 --> 00:44:50,349
No, no, no!

852
00:44:50,351 --> 00:44:53,019
Hey, dude, if you need,
like, a moment or...

853
00:44:53,021 --> 00:44:55,722
Oh, my God. No Graceland.

854
00:44:55,724 --> 00:44:57,456
No Beast.

855
00:44:57,458 --> 00:45:00,226
- No Little Rock.
- No Little Rock?

856
00:45:00,228 --> 00:45:02,028
Am I not allowed

857
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:06,800
one cock-sucking duck-fucking
little break in this world?

858
00:45:06,802 --> 00:45:08,903
You're not the only one
that's upset.

859
00:45:08,905 --> 00:45:12,673
Just... Just drive.
Drive, drive. Drive now!

860
00:45:12,675 --> 00:45:14,443
Get away from here. Go!

861
00:45:18,413 --> 00:45:20,546
<i>Graceland was a pile of rubble,</i>

862
00:45:20,548 --> 00:45:22,182
<i>Little Rock was still missing,</i>

863
00:45:22,184 --> 00:45:24,050
<i>and we were unsure
of our next move.</i>

864
00:45:24,052 --> 00:45:26,686
<i>But sometimes, you just have
to follow the signs.</i>

865
00:45:26,688 --> 00:45:28,655
Hm.

866
00:45:28,657 --> 00:45:30,860
Well, when Z-land
serves you lemons...

867
00:45:33,061 --> 00:45:35,264
Hey, Florida, 11 o'clock.

868
00:45:38,534 --> 00:45:40,032
What?

869
00:45:40,034 --> 00:45:44,039
- Hound Dog Hotel.
- Oh, what a bunch of bull.

870
00:45:45,974 --> 00:45:48,778
- Whoa, the Beast!
- Little Rock!

871
00:45:56,751 --> 00:45:59,452
Damn. Wow,

872
00:45:59,454 --> 00:46:01,220
for a place
that ain't Graceland,

873
00:46:01,222 --> 00:46:03,523
it sure looks a hell
of a lot like Graceland.

874
00:46:03,525 --> 00:46:05,124
- Yeah, it does.
- Here's the idea.

875
00:46:05,126 --> 00:46:06,760
We'll split up.
I'll go this way.

876
00:46:06,762 --> 00:46:08,561
No, no, no.
I should talk to her.

877
00:46:08,563 --> 00:46:11,632
I'm her sister. I'll talk to
her first. You guys stay here.

878
00:46:11,634 --> 00:46:13,400
Mm, sound.

879
00:46:13,402 --> 00:46:16,603
- Huh.
- Buh, buh, buh, buh.

880
00:46:16,605 --> 00:46:19,104
- Little respect.
- Why? He's dead probably.

881
00:46:19,106 --> 00:46:21,576
Oh. Oh, for you. Okay.

882
00:46:24,112 --> 00:46:26,313
- This is so degrading.
- It's not for me.

883
00:46:26,315 --> 00:46:27,315
Yeah, I know.

884
00:46:28,617 --> 00:46:30,117
Okay.

885
00:46:30,119 --> 00:46:32,119
- Oh, yeah.
- Smells like a wet dog died.

886
00:46:32,121 --> 00:46:33,854
- That's not... Push it.
- I am.

887
00:46:33,856 --> 00:46:36,659
- Square peg, round hole. Stop.
- Yeah, okay. Sorry.

888
00:46:41,230 --> 00:46:43,796
Oh, my God. It's uncanny.

889
00:46:43,798 --> 00:46:46,099
This is incredible.

890
00:46:46,101 --> 00:46:49,735
It's a perfect fit. I feel
like Cinderella at the ball.

891
00:46:49,737 --> 00:46:53,974
Are you jealous that I have
the same size shoe as Elvis?

892
00:46:53,976 --> 00:46:57,680
No. It's not like those
are Elvis' actual shoes.

893
00:47:00,748 --> 00:47:02,184

- Start talking.
- Ah, you first.

901
00:48:00,876 --> 00:48:03,376
- Hi, my name's Tallahassee.
- Nevada.

- Nevada's as close as you get.

Now, what are you doing
in the Hound Dog?

904
00:48:08,083 --> 00:48:11,052
I got a thing for the King.

No, no,
don't shoot my friends.

- Anybody else in here with you?
- No, just us.

907
00:48:18,159 --> 00:48:21,561
We're all civilized people.
Let's just put the guns down.

908
00:48:21,563 --> 00:48:24,664
Why the hell are you wearing
Elvis' actual shoes?

909
00:48:24,666 --> 00:48:25,701
Comfort.

910
00:48:27,369 --> 00:48:29,568
- You live here?
- Yeah.

911
00:48:29,570 --> 00:48:32,671
So that car out front, the girl
who was driving it, is she...

912
00:48:32,673 --> 00:48:35,742
Gone. She and that poser
peace lover of hers...

913
00:48:35,744 --> 00:48:38,311
- Berkeley.
- Berkeley.

914
00:48:38,313 --> 00:48:39,679
...took off a few days ago.

915
00:48:39,681 --> 00:48:41,682
And trust me,
they shouldn't have.

916
00:48:41,684 --> 00:48:42,916
It's not safe out there.

917
00:48:42,918 --> 00:48:45,818
- Damn it.
- Why didn't they take the Beast?

918
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:47,753
He said it was
too "establishment."

919
00:48:47,755 --> 00:48:51,090
Oh, I will kill
that little fart snack myself.

920
00:48:51,092 --> 00:48:53,092
You're lucky I didn't do
the same to you.

921
00:48:53,094 --> 00:48:56,231
Seriously. You know how close
I came to Murraying you?

922
00:48:59,268 --> 00:49:01,434
To what-ing him?

923
00:49:01,436 --> 00:49:04,403
Murraying him. You know,
when you shoot someone

924
00:49:04,405 --> 00:49:06,373
because you think
they're a zombie.

925
00:49:06,375 --> 00:49:09,141
Apparently, that's
how Bill Murray died.

926
00:49:09,143 --> 00:49:11,278
Wow, God, who's Bill Murray?
I never...

927
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:12,912
I don't even know
what that is.

928
00:49:12,914 --> 00:49:15,414
Oh, the actor.
That's so sad.

929
00:49:15,416 --> 00:49:17,117
I don't read <i>Variety.</i>
That's sad.

930
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:19,786
Sorry if you knew him.
If you didn't, I'm still sorry.

931
00:49:19,788 --> 00:49:22,554
It's sad when anybody dies.
Sounds like an urban legend.

932
00:49:22,556 --> 00:49:25,126
- It happened.
- I doubt it. It's weird. What?

933
00:49:27,797 --> 00:49:30,229
I'll say this about Murray,

934
00:49:30,231 --> 00:49:34,300
if I ever find out who did him,
I'm gonna do him.

935
00:49:34,302 --> 00:49:36,436
Me too. I'll be...
You first, but me second.

936
00:49:36,438 --> 00:49:38,204
Don't listen to this guy.

937
00:49:38,206 --> 00:49:39,873
He's killed more
celebrities than cocaine.

938
00:49:39,875 --> 00:49:41,608
The girl that was here before,

939
00:49:41,610 --> 00:49:43,242
did she say
where she was going?

940
00:49:43,244 --> 00:49:46,213
No, but that idiot Berkeley

941
00:49:46,215 --> 00:49:48,148
wouldn't shut up about it.

942
00:49:48,150 --> 00:49:50,383
Babylon is a commune,
safe haven,

943
00:49:50,385 --> 00:49:51,950
protected on all sides.

944
00:49:51,952 --> 00:49:55,387
Completely pacifist.
No guns or violence of any kind.

945
00:49:55,389 --> 00:49:57,157
A lot of young people too,
you know.

946
00:49:57,159 --> 00:49:59,226
Generation Z living
in peace and harmony.

947
00:49:59,228 --> 00:50:01,494
- It sounds cool.
- I know you had your heart set

948
00:50:01,496 --> 00:50:06,335
on this Graceland, but this
is <i>mucho, mucho</i> better.

949
00:50:13,376 --> 00:50:16,610
This is a very good replica
of the King's Jungle Room,

950
00:50:16,612 --> 00:50:18,945
where he recorded
his last two albums.

951
00:50:18,947 --> 00:50:22,782
<i>From Elvis Presley Boulevard,</i>
<i>Memphis, Tennessee</i> and...

952
00:50:22,784 --> 00:50:24,950
And <i>Moody Blue.</i>

953
00:50:24,952 --> 00:50:26,155
You know your Elvis.

954
00:50:27,621 --> 00:50:30,492
Every lover of the King
has a story.

955
00:50:31,626 --> 00:50:33,159
What's yours?

956
00:50:33,161 --> 00:50:36,563
My mama took me to see Elvis
when I was a kid.

957
00:50:36,565 --> 00:50:39,331
Something about him.
Attitude, the music...

958
00:50:39,333 --> 00:50:41,834
The hips, the ass.

959
00:50:41,836 --> 00:50:43,836
Well, I was 10,
but with Elvis,

960
00:50:43,838 --> 00:50:45,438
there is something
for everyone.

961
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,706
Cut to later,
I'm in high school.

962
00:50:47,708 --> 00:50:50,644
And my buddy
Frankie Hammond says, uh:

963
00:50:50,646 --> 00:50:52,979
"Do your Elvis."

964
00:50:52,981 --> 00:50:56,316
I said, "We're in the library.
It's gonna be loud."

965
00:50:56,318 --> 00:50:58,851
He convinces me. He starts
tapping his pencil,

966
00:50:58,853 --> 00:51:00,088
and I get up.

967
00:51:03,893 --> 00:51:07,327
♪ You ain't nothing
But a hound dog ♪

968
00:51:07,329 --> 00:51:10,162
♪ Crying all the time
Bo, bo, doo-de-doo ♪

969
00:51:10,164 --> 00:51:12,932
Everybody starts gathering
around and clapping,

970
00:51:12,934 --> 00:51:15,869
and I jumped on a table.
I finish off with a flourish.

971
00:51:15,871 --> 00:51:17,869
♪ You ain't never
Caught a rabbit ♪

972
00:51:17,871 --> 00:51:19,738
♪ You ain't no friend of mine ♪

973
00:51:21,208 --> 00:51:24,545
Yeah! And the whole place,
thunderous applause.

974
00:51:24,547 --> 00:51:27,713
And up comes the cutest girl
in the school,

975
00:51:27,715 --> 00:51:31,918
Robin Rogers, who never
gave me the time of day before.

976
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,253
She plants a kiss
on my cheek.

977
00:51:34,255 --> 00:51:36,555
And for a moment, just one,

978
00:51:36,557 --> 00:51:38,326
I felt like the King.

979
00:51:41,396 --> 00:51:44,233
I suddenly feel a little jealous
of Robin Rogers.

980
00:51:46,402 --> 00:51:47,402
You don't say.

981
00:51:49,670 --> 00:51:51,139
I don't know about you...

982
00:51:52,775 --> 00:51:54,477
...but I feel my temperature
rising.

983
00:51:59,081 --> 00:52:00,282
Mm.

984
00:52:03,217 --> 00:52:06,019
This is Babylon.

985
00:52:06,021 --> 00:52:09,421
Oh, like those ancient
hanging gardens.

986
00:52:09,423 --> 00:52:11,557
- Huh?
- Of Babylon.

987
00:52:11,559 --> 00:52:14,793
No, no. It's named
for that cool David Gray song.

988
00:52:14,795 --> 00:52:16,631
Man, I wish I'd written
that one.

989
00:52:17,967 --> 00:52:20,766
No guns allowed
is our one rule.

990
00:52:20,768 --> 00:52:23,938
- That, and no group sex.
- All right. Hand them over.

991
00:52:26,574 --> 00:52:28,807
Here you go.

992
00:52:28,809 --> 00:52:31,244
No guns. No guns.
Just hugs.

993
00:52:31,246 --> 00:52:33,079
Then welcome.

994
00:52:33,081 --> 00:52:35,447
Come on, señorita.
You're gonna love this place.

995
00:52:35,449 --> 00:52:37,516
It's completely safe
and entirely organic.

996
00:52:37,518 --> 00:52:39,452
- This is so cool.
- All right.

997
00:52:39,454 --> 00:52:42,155
We're gonna melt your guns here
and give you a pendant.

998
00:52:42,157 --> 00:52:43,990
- They melt it?
- Yeah.

999
00:52:43,992 --> 00:52:45,325
It's a symbolic thing.

1000
00:52:45,327 --> 00:52:46,959
Goodbye, violence.

1001
00:52:46,961 --> 00:52:48,595
Hello, peace.

1002
00:52:48,597 --> 00:52:49,795
Once we're done,

1003
00:52:49,797 --> 00:52:51,430
we'll take you up
to the rooftop.

1004
00:52:51,432 --> 00:52:52,599
I hope you like stairs.

1005
00:52:52,601 --> 00:52:53,601
That's good.

1006
00:52:57,405 --> 00:52:59,773
- Thanks.
- Welcome to Babylon.

1007
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:01,675
Let me show you the way.

1008
00:53:01,677 --> 00:53:02,809
Aw, right on.

1009
00:53:07,315 --> 00:53:09,014
Hey, brother. What's up?

1010
00:53:09,016 --> 00:53:10,719
- Hi.
- Yeah.

1011
00:53:30,471 --> 00:53:34,007
Wake
up, my little blue suede baby.

1012
00:53:34,009 --> 00:53:36,041
It's now or never. Ooh!

1013
00:53:36,043 --> 00:53:39,412
My friends say you're sleeping
like a tired pup.

1014
00:53:41,516 --> 00:53:42,682
What the fuck?

1015
00:53:43,918 --> 00:53:44,920
Shit.

1016
00:53:52,025 --> 00:53:54,494
Oh, no, no, no!

1017
00:53:54,496 --> 00:53:56,496
This is not happening!

1018
00:53:56,498 --> 00:53:59,633
This is not fucking happening!

1019
00:53:59,635 --> 00:54:01,833
Hey, motherfucker,
that's my ride!

1020
00:54:01,835 --> 00:54:04,369
Oh, my apologies,
tiny Elvis.

1021
00:54:04,371 --> 00:54:07,673
Just didn't expect anything
to be parked in my driveway.

1022
00:54:07,675 --> 00:54:08,744
Your driveway?

1023
00:54:10,478 --> 00:54:12,979
That's right. My driveway.

1024
00:54:12,981 --> 00:54:14,914
Well, that's funny.
When I parked in it,

1025
00:54:14,916 --> 00:54:16,282
no one told me to pull out.

1026
00:54:18,052 --> 00:54:20,519
Well, actually,
it's my driveway.

1027
00:54:20,521 --> 00:54:22,354
Hey, Nevada.

1028
00:54:22,356 --> 00:54:27,260
But see, when I'm
in town, I use it.

1029
00:54:27,262 --> 00:54:30,731
Well, I'm in town now,
and I'm using it.

1030
00:54:30,733 --> 00:54:32,865
Keep talking like this,
and I can arrange

1031
00:54:32,867 --> 00:54:35,767
so neither of you
ever uses my driveway again.

1032
00:54:35,769 --> 00:54:37,802
I don't think they're talking
about the driveway.

1033
00:54:37,804 --> 00:54:39,206
No, I don't think so.

1034
00:54:39,208 --> 00:54:41,474
- You happy now? Good move.
- Satisfied? Good job.

1035
00:54:41,476 --> 00:54:44,309
- Does he remind you of...?
- Yeah, it's weird.

1036
00:54:44,311 --> 00:54:47,079
I don't like you at all.

1037
00:54:47,081 --> 00:54:48,447
It's not weird,
it's creepy.

1038
00:54:48,449 --> 00:54:50,115
It's like
an un-funhouse mirror.

1039
00:54:50,117 --> 00:54:53,385
I think you double-parked
or more perpendicular-parked.

1040
00:54:53,387 --> 00:54:55,421
- Hope we don't get a ticket.
- Whoa.

1041
00:54:55,423 --> 00:54:57,523
- Calm down.
- I'm just ragging you.

1042
00:54:57,525 --> 00:55:00,092
- What is going on here?
- What?

1043
00:55:00,094 --> 00:55:02,195
- What do you mean, "what"?
- What?

1044
00:55:02,197 --> 00:55:05,030
- Does he not remind you of...?
- Hello, everyone.

1045
00:55:05,032 --> 00:55:07,233
Of... Of what?

1046
00:55:07,235 --> 00:55:08,735
- This is Albuquerque.
- Howdy.

1047
00:55:08,737 --> 00:55:10,869
- I'm Flagstaff.
- Hey. I'm Columbus.

1048
00:55:10,871 --> 00:55:12,472
Oh, great.

1049
00:55:12,474 --> 00:55:15,208
Uh, this is Tallahassee,
Wichita,

1050
00:55:15,210 --> 00:55:17,409
- and I guess you know Nevada.
- Yes, I do.

1051
00:55:17,411 --> 00:55:18,577
Easy, cowboy.

1052
00:55:18,579 --> 00:55:20,612
So sorry about your ex-car.

1053
00:55:20,614 --> 00:55:23,985
I guess, as I like to say,
expect the unexpected.

1054
00:55:25,253 --> 00:55:28,320
- It's one of my commandments.
- Oh.

1055
00:55:28,322 --> 00:55:30,289
- Commandments?
- Yeah. Sort of guidelines

1056
00:55:30,291 --> 00:55:32,425
for staying alive.
I've got loads of them.

1057
00:55:32,427 --> 00:55:34,461
- Hm, interesting.
- Number one is teamwork.

1058
00:55:34,463 --> 00:55:37,030
Teamwork. That's so great.

1059
00:55:37,032 --> 00:55:38,932
I spent a long time
thinking about it.

1060
00:55:38,934 --> 00:55:41,601
I have rules, you know,
which is, like, less biblical.

1061
00:55:41,603 --> 00:55:44,336
I love rules. Without rules,
everything's chaos.

1062
00:55:44,338 --> 00:55:46,840
- Thank you.
- Columbus has quite a few rules.

1063
00:55:46,842 --> 00:55:48,941
- I do.
- Awesome. Like what?

1064
00:55:48,943 --> 00:55:51,344
- I don't wanna toot my own horn.
- Go on, toot.

1065
00:55:51,346 --> 00:55:53,579
- Let me toot for him. Uh...
- Thank you.

1066
00:55:53,581 --> 00:55:56,583
- Number one, cardio.
- That's right.

1067
00:55:56,585 --> 00:55:57,751
Cardio. Okay.

1068
00:55:57,753 --> 00:55:59,786
- What?
- I don't mean to laugh.

1069
00:55:59,788 --> 00:56:03,789
It's just that cardiovascular
fitness is his number 29,

1070
00:56:03,791 --> 00:56:05,592
meaning he has
28 other commandments

1071
00:56:05,594 --> 00:56:07,193
that he finds more important,

1072
00:56:07,195 --> 00:56:09,795
like, say, what's one
of your great ones?

1073
00:56:09,797 --> 00:56:12,499
Number 12. The world
is your bathroom, meaning

1074
00:56:12,501 --> 00:56:15,769
you can whip it out wherever
you want, and have at it.

1075
00:56:15,771 --> 00:56:17,970
Oh, just whip it out
wherever you want!

1076
00:56:17,972 --> 00:56:19,505
That sounds a little uncouth.

1077
00:56:19,507 --> 00:56:21,807
The "whip it out" part's
for guys, obviously.

1078
00:56:21,809 --> 00:56:24,744
If you're a woman,
you can reveal it.

1079
00:56:24,746 --> 00:56:27,012
- Whichever.
- I have beware of bathrooms.

1080
00:56:27,014 --> 00:56:29,215
Yeah, I'm just generally
careful around them.

1081
00:56:29,217 --> 00:56:31,349
But it's not a competition.

1082
00:56:31,351 --> 00:56:34,220
- No, doesn't have to be.
- But number 18 is limber up.

1083
00:56:34,222 --> 00:56:36,255
- But that's...
- That's fine. I have warm up.

1084
00:56:36,257 --> 00:56:39,325
Again, not a competition,
but commandment number 45

1085
00:56:39,327 --> 00:56:41,594
for me is, well,
mind your manners.

1086
00:56:41,596 --> 00:56:43,195
Just because
it's the apocalypse

1087
00:56:43,197 --> 00:56:44,831
doesn't mean
you have to be rude.

1088
00:56:44,833 --> 00:56:46,731
Keep your hands
to yourself, number 42.

1089
00:56:46,733 --> 00:56:47,867
Do you have sunscreen?

1090
00:56:47,869 --> 00:56:49,603
- Just shade.
- Shade. Of course.

1091
00:56:49,605 --> 00:56:52,572
It's free. It's everywhere.
Yeah. Number two, double tap.

1092
00:56:52,574 --> 00:56:54,974
I have number five,
confirm your kill.

1093
00:56:54,976 --> 00:56:57,010
- Confirm your kill.
- Avoid perishables.

1094
00:56:57,012 --> 00:56:58,979
- Do you have that?
- Sorry. Ziploc bags.

1095
00:56:58,981 --> 00:57:01,046
- Same thing, different word.
- Yeah. Exactly.

1096
00:57:01,048 --> 00:57:03,416
I probably would shy away
from the word "Ziploc"

1097
00:57:03,418 --> 00:57:05,150
because I try
to avoid name brands.

1098
00:57:05,152 --> 00:57:08,220
Okay, great. So, what brought
you guys back so soon?

1099
00:57:08,222 --> 00:57:11,224
We was headed for the Rockies,
but the goddamn Bolts...

1100
00:57:11,226 --> 00:57:13,059
- Bolts?
- Yeah.

1101
00:57:13,061 --> 00:57:14,661
The zombies
out on the plains.

1102
00:57:14,663 --> 00:57:16,896
They're a lot tougher
than what we're used to.

1103
00:57:16,898 --> 00:57:19,898
I guess because of all
the running and hunting.

1104
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:22,068
So we call them Bolts,
as in Usain.

1105
00:57:22,070 --> 00:57:23,603
As in pretty fucking athletic.

1106
00:57:23,605 --> 00:57:25,472
No, that makes total sense.

1107
00:57:25,474 --> 00:57:27,974
- We call them T-800s.
- <i>Terminator.</i> Yes! I love it.

1108
00:57:27,976 --> 00:57:29,275
Really?

1109
00:57:29,277 --> 00:57:30,909
Yes. My favorite movie.
Well, <i>T2.</i>

1110
00:57:30,911 --> 00:57:32,744
Yeah, <i>T2</i> is my
second favorite movie.

1111
00:57:32,746 --> 00:57:35,815
- What's number one?
- Uh, it's <i>Fantasia.</i>

1112
00:57:36,983 --> 00:57:38,583
Well, anyhow,

1113
00:57:38,585 --> 00:57:40,552
the Bolts' food sources
are running low,

1114
00:57:40,554 --> 00:57:42,655
so they're pushing east,
which is <i>no bueno.</i>

1115
00:57:42,657 --> 00:57:44,824
You know what else
is <i>no bueno?</i>

1116
00:57:44,826 --> 00:57:47,126
You murdered the Beast.

1117
00:57:47,128 --> 00:57:50,063
Yeah, well, let me
call AAA for you.

1118
00:57:50,065 --> 00:57:52,498
I'm sure they'll be right over.

1119
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:54,867
So you have to play
your cards as...

1120
00:57:54,869 --> 00:57:57,970
Whoo, that onesie was starting
to cut off my circulation.

1121
00:57:57,972 --> 00:58:00,907
- To your vagina?
- Your vagina.

1122
00:58:00,909 --> 00:58:02,907
What'll you have, Florida?

1123
00:58:02,909 --> 00:58:05,644
He strikes me as
the, uh, lemon drop type.

1124
00:58:05,646 --> 00:58:08,648
You know, something with an
umbrella or something like that.

1125
00:58:08,650 --> 00:58:11,251
I heard "something with
an umbrella." Make it two.

1126
00:58:11,253 --> 00:58:12,284
Three please. Three.

1127
00:58:12,286 --> 00:58:14,320
So that's your sidekick.

1128
00:58:14,322 --> 00:58:15,889
That's my partner.

1129
00:58:15,891 --> 00:58:18,490
You might look
at Flagstaff and think:

1130
00:58:18,492 --> 00:58:21,126
"Oh, he's a little slight,
diminutive."

1131
00:58:21,128 --> 00:58:24,998
Effeminate even, but he's
a real beast in battle. Yeah.

1132
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,133
Come on. You're being sweet.
You sweet, sweet man. Thank you.

1133
00:58:28,135 --> 00:58:29,834
- Well, I love you.
- Love you too.

1134
00:58:29,836 --> 00:58:32,472
Yeah, you know, Tubbs
to my Crockett over here.

1135
00:58:32,474 --> 00:58:35,441
He may look a little bookish,
but he's an animal too.

1136
00:58:35,443 --> 00:58:38,144
He eats zombies for breakfast,
shits them out by lunch.

1137
00:58:38,146 --> 00:58:39,644
Cheers.

1138
00:58:39,646 --> 00:58:41,847
He shits out
everything by lunch.

1139
00:58:44,452 --> 00:58:46,719
What the hell was that?

1140
00:58:50,625 --> 00:58:52,224
They must have
followed you.

1141
00:58:52,226 --> 00:58:54,293
Oh, God, those are T-800s.

1142
00:58:54,295 --> 00:58:56,162
Or at the very least T-700s.

1143
00:58:56,164 --> 00:58:58,930
- There was no T-700.
- Yeah, T-800's the first model.

1144
00:58:58,932 --> 00:59:02,001
This is great,
having the two of you.

1145
00:59:02,003 --> 00:59:04,604
Okay.
Time to nut up or shut up.

1146
00:59:04,606 --> 00:59:07,474
That saying's very 2009.

1147
00:59:11,012 --> 00:59:13,845
- Okay. We got this.
- Ho!

1148
00:59:13,847 --> 00:59:16,115
You don't send a boy
to do a man's job.

1149
00:59:16,117 --> 00:59:18,450
We brought them here.
We'll take care of it.

1150
00:59:18,452 --> 00:59:20,985
Yeah, you know what?
Have at 'em.

1151
00:59:20,987 --> 00:59:23,121
You have a safe word
in case things go bad?

1152
00:59:23,123 --> 00:59:24,691
Heh, that's good.
Come on, Flag,

1153
00:59:24,693 --> 00:59:26,793
let's show these fuckers
how it's done.

1154
00:59:26,795 --> 00:59:28,860
Sure. You got it, boss.

1155
00:59:28,862 --> 00:59:31,363
<i>Hasta la vista,</i> baby.
<i>Terminator 2.</i>

1156
00:59:31,365 --> 00:59:33,699
- Remember?
- Ready, buddy?

1157
00:59:33,701 --> 00:59:35,867
He's so cool.

1158
00:59:35,869 --> 00:59:38,204
Whoo, heh, heh!
Suck these bullets!

1159
00:59:38,206 --> 00:59:39,673
Come on! Get you some!

1160
00:59:39,675 --> 00:59:42,675
Anybody else find those
two uniquely annoying?

1161
00:59:42,677 --> 00:59:45,113
- Get it!
- Uniquely? No.

1162
00:59:47,081 --> 00:59:48,882
Well, I don't love
their chances.

1163
00:59:48,884 --> 00:59:51,684
They ignored rule 52,
don't be afraid to ask for help.

1164
00:59:51,686 --> 00:59:54,019
Get fucked in the face, bitch!

1165
00:59:54,021 --> 00:59:55,688
- Flagstaff?
- Yeah, boss?

1166
00:59:55,690 --> 00:59:58,724
You made the all-star team
today. I mean, no kidding.

1167
00:59:58,726 --> 01:00:00,059
Unbelievable job.

1168
01:00:00,061 --> 01:00:01,927
And is it me,
or are those Bolts

1169
01:00:01,929 --> 01:00:04,030
they're just getting meaner
by the day?

1170
01:00:04,032 --> 01:00:07,032
- They're full-blown dickheads.
- I got an action shot of you

1171
01:00:07,034 --> 01:00:09,269
that's going right
into the scrapbook.

1172
01:00:09,271 --> 01:00:12,371
This is gonna be a good one.
You just keep raising the bar,

1173
01:00:12,373 --> 01:00:15,907
and that's why we will continue
to ride these highways together.

1174
01:00:15,909 --> 01:00:18,344
- I'm so proud of you.
- I learned from the best.

1175
01:00:18,346 --> 01:00:20,380
- Oh, come on now.
- Nice work, Querq.

1176
01:00:20,382 --> 01:00:21,748
Thank you. Thank you.

1177
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:24,282
This is gonna be
a hell of a shot. Ha, ha!

1178
01:00:24,284 --> 01:00:26,751
It's so cool he let you
wear the hat.

1179
01:00:26,753 --> 01:00:28,287
- Querq?
- Yeah?

1180
01:00:28,289 --> 01:00:31,157
I think you got
a little something here.

1181
01:00:32,827 --> 01:00:34,325
Oh, what, that?

1182
01:00:35,896 --> 01:00:39,231
Oh, yeah, that's just...
That's just a tattoo.

1183
01:00:41,235 --> 01:00:44,170
Sorry, you got a tattoo
of a zombie bite?

1184
01:00:44,172 --> 01:00:48,074
No, it's just a tattoo
I got one night in Bernalillo.

1185
01:00:48,076 --> 01:00:49,076
Huh.

1186
01:00:50,143 --> 01:00:51,476
All right, everybody.

1187
01:00:51,478 --> 01:00:55,148
Just take it easy.
Everything's fine.

1188
01:00:55,150 --> 01:00:57,950
Nevada, why don't you whip up
some of your signature...

1189
01:01:01,956 --> 01:01:04,590
All right.
That was a little weird, huh?

1190
01:01:04,592 --> 01:01:07,659
- Yeah.
- All right. Just calm down.

1191
01:01:07,661 --> 01:01:09,595
We'll just
have a drink, you know.

1192
01:01:10,898 --> 01:01:13,934
So we can just kind
of celeb... Celeb...

1193
01:01:17,003 --> 01:01:19,237
Excuse me. It's okay.

1194
01:01:19,239 --> 01:01:21,773
It's just nerves
from the fight. Just...

1195
01:01:22,909 --> 01:01:24,309
Uh, you guys, I think

1196
01:01:24,311 --> 01:01:26,512
Albuquerque might be infected.

1197
01:01:26,514 --> 01:01:28,313
Me? I'm infected?

1198
01:01:29,351 --> 01:01:30,682
You got bit twice.

1199
01:01:30,684 --> 01:01:32,717
- Ah, Flagstaff!
- No, no. That's a lie.

1200
01:01:32,719 --> 01:01:34,720
Trust me. Okay? Trust me.

1201
01:01:34,722 --> 01:01:36,356
I don't get bit.
I never get bit.

1202
01:01:36,358 --> 01:01:38,490
I don't get bit either.
We're slippery.

1203
01:01:38,492 --> 01:01:39,858
- See?
- I know. Are you okay?

1204
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:41,994
- I'm fine. I'm totally fine.
- You are?

1205
01:01:41,996 --> 01:01:44,066
- I'm fine.
- Okay, he's fine. He's fine.

1206
01:01:45,166 --> 01:01:46,865
No, he's not fine. No.

1207
01:01:46,867 --> 01:01:50,869
No. You're starting to look
like a T-800. <i>Terminator 2.</i>

1208
01:01:53,074 --> 01:01:54,509
No. No, no, no!

1209
01:01:55,543 --> 01:01:57,376
No!

1210
01:01:57,378 --> 01:01:58,476
Aah!

1211
01:01:58,478 --> 01:02:01,146
Move! Move!
Get out of the way.

1212
01:02:01,148 --> 01:02:03,282
Aah! Aah!

1213
01:02:03,284 --> 01:02:04,284
Ow!

1214
01:02:07,054 --> 01:02:08,454
No! No!

1215
01:02:09,958 --> 01:02:11,322
Flagstaff, you're breaking

1216
01:02:11,324 --> 01:02:13,094
like 10 commandments right now!

1217
01:02:19,065 --> 01:02:21,936
This is for what you did
to the Beast! Unh!

1218
01:02:23,538 --> 01:02:24,570
Sorry!

1219
01:02:26,306 --> 01:02:27,539
- How you doing?
- Bad!

1220
01:02:27,541 --> 01:02:29,141
- How are you?
- Bad!

1221
01:02:30,811 --> 01:02:32,681
Sorry, shoes. Sorry, Elvis.

1222
01:02:39,688 --> 01:02:41,088
Oh, shit. Oh!

1223
01:02:42,722 --> 01:02:45,691
- How you doing now?
- Still bad! You wanna switch?

1224
01:02:45,693 --> 01:02:48,461
Switch?
How would that benefit me?

1225
01:02:56,536 --> 01:02:57,605
Shit!

1226
01:03:04,746 --> 01:03:08,583
- Help! Shoot him! Shoot him!
- I don't wanna hit you!

1227
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:14,586
Shit.

1228
01:03:14,588 --> 01:03:17,159
Gun, gun, gun! Oh, shit!

1229
01:03:20,195 --> 01:03:22,128
Stop shooting! I got this!

1230
01:03:22,130 --> 01:03:23,498
Great, because I'm reloading!

1231
01:03:32,572 --> 01:03:36,474
Don't swing! Don't swing!
Don't swing! Swing!

1232
01:03:36,476 --> 01:03:38,443
Shit!

1233
01:03:38,445 --> 01:03:41,179
No, no, no, not me!
Not me! Oh, fuck!

1234
01:03:41,181 --> 01:03:44,316
<i>Hasta la vista,</i> baby.

1235
01:03:44,318 --> 01:03:46,621
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1236
01:03:47,956 --> 01:03:50,688
Those guys are dicks.

1237
01:03:50,690 --> 01:03:52,325
Great job.

1238
01:03:52,327 --> 01:03:53,626
Thank you.

1239
01:03:53,628 --> 01:03:56,528
- Ah. Can I wear the hat?
- Oh, negatory.

1240
01:03:56,530 --> 01:04:00,199
- Cool.
- Zombie Kill of the Year?

1241
01:04:00,201 --> 01:04:03,336
<i>Mm, sorry.
Not with the performance just turned in</i>

1242
01:04:03,338 --> 01:04:05,037
<i>by Matteo Bianchi
of Pisa, Italy.</i>

1243
01:04:05,139 --> 01:04:08,941
Help! I'm a lost
tourist with two defenseless children.

1244
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:11,180
Help!

1245
01:04:14,184 --> 01:04:16,384
Fucking sons of bitches!

1246
01:04:19,987 --> 01:04:21,889
<i>Yeah, yeah. That Pisa.</i>

1247
01:04:22,058 --> 01:04:23,858
You won't eat me.

1248
01:04:24,561 --> 01:04:26,261
Not today!

1249
01:04:33,002 --> 01:04:34,702
Go fuck yourselves!

1250
01:04:36,003 --> 01:04:37,471
Bravisimmo, <i>Mateo.</i>

1251
01:04:40,375 --> 01:04:43,342
Ahh, Sunday, Sunday, Sunday!

1252
01:04:43,344 --> 01:04:45,911
Jesus, Big Fat Death is right.

1253
01:04:45,913 --> 01:04:48,648
That thing is, like,
a huge rollover risk.

1254
01:04:48,650 --> 01:04:50,383
It is.

1255
01:04:50,385 --> 01:04:53,818
Hey, dude, I think you should
ask her to come with us.

1256
01:04:53,820 --> 01:04:55,054
- No, no, no.
- Come on, yes.

1257
01:04:55,056 --> 01:04:57,188
I think they make
a nice match.

1258
01:04:57,190 --> 01:04:59,157
Look, what have I been
telling you guys?

1259
01:04:59,159 --> 01:05:01,327
I'm trying to shed baggage,
not pick it up.

1260
01:05:01,329 --> 01:05:04,429
- Yeah.
- Besides, she wouldn't do that.

1261
01:05:04,431 --> 01:05:05,866
She's not the type.

1262
01:05:08,936 --> 01:05:10,505
Stay safe,
Sunshine State.

1263
01:05:12,472 --> 01:05:14,009
Excuse me.

1264
01:05:18,313 --> 01:05:20,045
Stay dangerous, Nevada.

1265
01:05:28,155 --> 01:05:32,258
Okay. Hey, no offense, but
my sister is still out there.

1266
01:05:32,260 --> 01:05:34,596
Wanna hit the old road.

1267
01:05:35,929 --> 01:05:38,098
If by some miracle
you don't die...

1268
01:05:39,833 --> 01:05:42,436
there's always room
in my driveway.

1269
01:05:45,105 --> 01:05:46,574
I best stay alive.

1270
01:05:49,309 --> 01:05:50,876
Okay, you're back. Good.

1271
01:05:50,878 --> 01:05:53,244
Do you know how to drive
one of these things?

1272
01:05:53,246 --> 01:05:56,548
I'm gonna just pop that puppy
off of there

1273
01:05:56,550 --> 01:05:59,050
and then you guys can jump in.

1274
01:05:59,052 --> 01:06:00,487
Nice.

1275
01:06:02,590 --> 01:06:05,458
She's a big old stallion,
but I can tame her.

1276
01:06:12,333 --> 01:06:13,802
Whoo!

1277
01:06:17,771 --> 01:06:18,871
Oh, shit.

1278
01:06:23,110 --> 01:06:25,780
- I think he's got the hang of it.
- Shit!

1279
01:06:26,914 --> 01:06:28,748
- No. No, no.
- No, no, no.

1280
01:06:28,750 --> 01:06:30,916
Goddamn motherfucker!

1281
01:06:30,918 --> 01:06:32,019
Got it.

1282
01:06:39,059 --> 01:06:42,628
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

1283
01:06:42,630 --> 01:06:44,332
Maybe you should
leave a note.

1284
01:06:45,934 --> 01:06:47,266
That's your department.

1285
01:06:52,139 --> 01:06:55,539
I... I just can't do it.

1286
01:06:55,541 --> 01:06:56,810
Yeah. I'll drive.

1287
01:07:03,483 --> 01:07:05,085
What was that?

1288
01:07:06,353 --> 01:07:07,619
Satisfying.

1289
01:07:13,293 --> 01:07:15,094
Teamwork. Always put
the team first.

1290
01:07:15,096 --> 01:07:17,195
I can't believe
I didn't have that. Stupid.

1291
01:07:17,197 --> 01:07:19,632
You know, if Flagstaff
was so great,

1292
01:07:19,634 --> 01:07:23,001
then where was
the undeniably gorgeous

1293
01:07:23,003 --> 01:07:25,938
but emotionally inaccessible
Kansas City?

1294
01:07:25,940 --> 01:07:27,505
I don't know. Maybe she split

1295
01:07:27,507 --> 01:07:30,043
because she thought
they had a random relationship.

1296
01:07:30,045 --> 01:07:33,144
Or maybe she was
just about to come back

1297
01:07:33,146 --> 01:07:36,351
under the thinly veiled cover
of needing guns and ammo.

1298
01:07:37,550 --> 01:07:40,151
Wait,
what are you getting at?

1299
01:07:40,153 --> 01:07:42,720
I think you're smart enough
to figure it out...

1300
01:07:42,722 --> 01:07:44,724
Oh, my God.

1301
01:07:44,726 --> 01:07:46,758
You gotta be kidding me.

1302
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:48,195
You gotta be kidding me.

1303
01:07:49,530 --> 01:07:51,597
You gotta be kidding me!

1304
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:53,932
You gotta be fucking
kidding me.

1305
01:07:53,934 --> 01:07:55,534
Why the hell
is she still alive?

1306
01:07:55,536 --> 01:07:59,237
Oh, my God, I literally
missed you guys. Yay!

1307
01:07:59,239 --> 01:08:00,240
Oh, my God.

1308
01:08:01,942 --> 01:08:03,842
Whoa!

1309
01:08:03,844 --> 01:08:05,344
Just... No, just look ahead.

1310
01:08:05,346 --> 01:08:08,079
Hi, old guy!

1311
01:08:08,081 --> 01:08:09,514
Let's hang out.

1312
01:08:09,516 --> 01:08:11,284
- Ha-ha-ha!
- It is so weird to see you.

1313
01:08:11,286 --> 01:08:13,418
The last time I saw you,
you were like a...

1314
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:14,887
- You were a zombie.
- I wish.

1315
01:08:14,889 --> 01:08:16,921
Stupid nut allergy.

1316
01:08:16,923 --> 01:08:18,557
- Nut allergy? Oh.
- Yeah.

1317
01:08:18,559 --> 01:08:21,160
Yeah, I think it was
the trail mix Wichita gave me.

1318
01:08:21,162 --> 01:08:23,262
Who knew there were nuts
in trail mix.

1319
01:08:23,264 --> 01:08:25,330
Not me. I thought it was vegan.

1320
01:08:25,332 --> 01:08:26,865
I kept trying to tell you

1321
01:08:26,867 --> 01:08:29,335
it was only an allergic
reaction, but you thought

1322
01:08:29,337 --> 01:08:31,736
- I was trying to bite you.
- Yeah, well...

1323
01:08:31,738 --> 01:08:35,440
- Not that you minded last time.
- Mm.

1324
01:08:35,442 --> 01:08:37,343
Thank you for shooting
over my head.

1325
01:08:37,345 --> 01:08:39,512
I was really just trying
to scare you off.

1326
01:08:39,514 --> 01:08:41,513
You're not gonna get rid
of me that easy.

1327
01:08:41,515 --> 01:08:43,115
- Oh, no!
- Ha-ha-ha.

1328
01:08:43,117 --> 01:08:46,785
There I was, hiding in
the woods, when I thought:

1329
01:08:46,787 --> 01:08:50,990
"I used to live in a freezer,
so why not a freezer on wheels?"

1330
01:08:50,992 --> 01:08:53,092
Can't argue
with that logic.

1331
01:08:53,094 --> 01:08:55,561
I really miss this.

1332
01:08:55,563 --> 01:08:57,595
Was that sarcasm?

1333
01:08:57,597 --> 01:08:59,232
Was it?

1334
01:08:59,234 --> 01:09:00,234
Mm-hm.

1335
01:09:05,006 --> 01:09:07,673
Why wouldn't we
just move to an island?

1336
01:09:07,675 --> 01:09:09,273
That's a really
good idea.

1337
01:09:09,275 --> 01:09:10,809
Then there
wouldn't be zombies.

1338
01:09:10,811 --> 01:09:12,311
- Right.
- Of course.

1339
01:09:12,313 --> 01:09:14,548
We should go
to Temptation Island.

1340
01:09:16,449 --> 01:09:18,584
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey.

1341
01:09:18,586 --> 01:09:20,085
- What?
- Hey, hey.

1342
01:09:20,087 --> 01:09:22,219
- Hey, hey. Hey, hey.
- Hey, hey.

1343
01:09:22,221 --> 01:09:24,055
Just... Just eyes
on the road.

1344
01:09:24,057 --> 01:09:26,724
Do you want me to change
the CD or anything?

1345
01:09:26,726 --> 01:09:28,393
Is this a CD playing?

1346
01:09:28,395 --> 01:09:29,928
- Yeah. It's Port...
- What is this?

1347
01:09:29,930 --> 01:09:31,964
It's Portishead.

1348
01:09:31,966 --> 01:09:34,333
- This is Portishead?
- Yeah. You know what's funny?

1349
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:36,501
I used to think
it was called "Portashed"

1350
01:09:36,503 --> 01:09:39,303
until I went to one of
the concerts, and she explained.

1351
01:09:39,305 --> 01:09:40,973
Yeah, I would think
"Portasheed."

1352
01:09:40,975 --> 01:09:43,976
- Right. Yeah, that's funny.
- Yeah.

1353
01:09:43,978 --> 01:09:45,643
<i>It was obvious to me</i>

1354
01:09:45,645 --> 01:09:47,845
<i>that Wichita and I
were meant to be together,</i>

1355
01:09:47,847 --> 01:09:49,313
<i>which is why Madison's return</i>

1356
01:09:49,315 --> 01:09:50,950
<i>could not have been
worse timing.</i>

1357
01:09:50,952 --> 01:09:53,018
<i>Of course, I was glad
she wasn't a zombie.</i>

1358
01:09:53,020 --> 01:09:55,857
<i>But couldn't she have just
gone back to her mall fridge?</i>

1359
01:09:58,525 --> 01:10:00,994
Hey. Hey, look,
look, look. Look.

1360
01:10:04,731 --> 01:10:05,830
Look.

1361
01:10:09,470 --> 01:10:12,137
We made it to Baby-lon.

1362
01:10:12,139 --> 01:10:15,708
<i>If you hear more than
the usual excitement in my voice,</i>

1363
01:10:15,710 --> 01:10:17,476
<i>it's for two reasons.</i>

1364
01:10:17,478 --> 01:10:20,211
<i>One, we may have caught up
to Little Rock,</i>

1365
01:10:20,213 --> 01:10:21,414
<i>for real this time.</i>

1366
01:10:21,416 --> 01:10:22,947
<i>And two, we may have</i>

1367
01:10:22,949 --> 01:10:25,183
<i>finally found our forever home,</i>

1368
01:10:25,185 --> 01:10:27,486
<i>which is what I've been
looking for all along.</i>

1369
01:10:27,488 --> 01:10:30,990
- Whoa, Babylon.
- I love that song.

1370
01:10:30,992 --> 01:10:33,791
- Hm?
- This place is soy cute.

1371
01:10:38,966 --> 01:10:42,032
- Whoa, Jesus!
- What the fuck?

1372
01:10:42,034 --> 01:10:45,236
- Enjoy the little things.
- My bags were in there!

1373
01:10:45,238 --> 01:10:48,040
- No, they weren't.
- No guns allowed!

1374
01:10:50,077 --> 01:10:52,677
I like this place already.
You got a sense of humor.

1375
01:10:52,679 --> 01:10:54,412
No guns allowed.

1376
01:10:54,414 --> 01:10:59,018
I'm not giving up my guns under
any circumstances, period-o.

1377
01:10:59,020 --> 01:11:01,920
Well, then, there's no way
you're getting up to Babylon.

1378
01:11:01,922 --> 01:11:03,957
You know, you could
always wait in the car.

1379
01:11:07,628 --> 01:11:09,463
Do you wanna see
Little Rock or not?

1380
01:11:23,409 --> 01:11:25,210
There she is!

1381
01:11:25,212 --> 01:11:27,344
I'm on a 40-day bowel blast.

1382
01:11:27,346 --> 01:11:28,615
Little Rock.

1383
01:11:30,184 --> 01:11:33,018
- Hey.
- Hi.

1384
01:11:33,020 --> 01:11:34,419
What are you guys
doing here?

1385
01:11:34,421 --> 01:11:36,054
I am so glad you're safe.

1386
01:11:36,056 --> 01:11:37,723
- Wow, okay.
- Oh, my God.

1387
01:11:37,725 --> 01:11:39,125
- Come here.
- Hello.

1388
01:11:39,127 --> 01:11:40,960
Seriously, what are
you doing here?

1389
01:11:40,962 --> 01:11:43,062
Hey, we don't leave
each other.

1390
01:11:43,064 --> 01:11:44,696
I know, I know.
I'm really sorry.

1391
01:11:44,698 --> 01:11:46,898
Make me a pact.
No more notes. Ever.

1392
01:11:46,900 --> 01:11:48,767
- No more notes. Ever.
- Ever. Great.

1393
01:11:48,769 --> 01:11:50,637
Just so you know,
there's no group sex.

1394
01:11:51,972 --> 01:11:54,106
- Okay, fine, group sex.
- Oh, whoa.

1395
01:11:54,108 --> 01:11:56,441
Hey, Wichita. That means
you're Columbus,

1396
01:11:56,443 --> 01:11:58,611
and that makes you Tallahassee.

1397
01:11:58,613 --> 01:12:00,611
- Berkeley?
- You're from Berkeley?

1398
01:12:00,613 --> 01:12:02,446
- You're Berkeley?
- No, come on.

1399
01:12:02,448 --> 01:12:04,683
What are the chances
we're both from Berkeley?

1400
01:12:04,685 --> 01:12:06,619
- Berkeley!
- Calm down, calm down. Okay?

1401
01:12:06,621 --> 01:12:08,987
Thank you for coming
to check up on me, I guess.

1402
01:12:08,989 --> 01:12:11,757
But you have to understand
these people are peaceful,

1403
01:12:11,759 --> 01:12:13,491
and they're friendly and nice.

1404
01:12:13,493 --> 01:12:16,193
And honestly, I don't think
you're gonna fit in here.

1405
01:12:16,195 --> 01:12:19,630
- They melted our fucking weapons!
- This is exactly what I meant.

1406
01:12:19,632 --> 01:12:22,267
Guys, I think
we should stay.

1407
01:12:22,269 --> 01:12:25,004
- You don't get a vote.
- I do get a vote.

1408
01:12:25,006 --> 01:12:27,138
Haven't you ever heard
of women suffering?

1409
01:12:27,140 --> 01:12:28,343
Women's suffrage?

1410
01:12:29,443 --> 01:12:31,343
- No, honey.
- Oh, boy.

1411
01:12:31,345 --> 01:12:33,079
- Who the hell is this?
- I'm Madison.

1412
01:12:33,081 --> 01:12:34,646
- Don't say it.
- You'll love this.

1413
01:12:34,648 --> 01:12:37,348
- Don't say it.
- That's Columbus' girlfriend.

1414
01:12:37,350 --> 01:12:38,683
It's official.

1415
01:12:38,685 --> 01:12:39,852
Wow, you just didn't

1416
01:12:39,854 --> 01:12:41,419
waste any time, did you?

1417
01:12:41,421 --> 01:12:44,121
- Well, thank you for your vote.
- And you're welcome.

1418
01:12:44,123 --> 01:12:47,293
Okay. I'm late for my
drum circle, so I gotta go.

1419
01:12:47,295 --> 01:12:48,526
Hey, Little Rock!

1420
01:12:48,528 --> 01:12:50,329
Sorry about that.

1421
01:13:00,341 --> 01:13:02,040
<i>Seeing Little Rock safe</i>

1422
01:13:02,042 --> 01:13:04,041
<i>and surrounded by friends
her own age,</i>

1423
01:13:04,043 --> 01:13:07,312
<i>Tallahassee realized
his nest was now empty.</i>

1424
01:13:07,314 --> 01:13:09,647
<i>And he began to hear
the call of the buffalo.</i>

1425
01:13:16,390 --> 01:13:18,589
All right, I'm ready!

1426
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:21,026
Come on, don't be
so Gloria Glum.

1427
01:13:21,028 --> 01:13:22,660
I told you guys
I was leaving.

1428
01:13:22,662 --> 01:13:24,564
So, what, you're
just gonna split?

1429
01:13:27,067 --> 01:13:30,902
It's time. Gotta set out
on my own adventures.

1430
01:13:30,904 --> 01:13:32,836
Little Rock's
safe,

1431
01:13:32,838 --> 01:13:35,777
and, uh,
a lone wolf's gotta hunt.

1432
01:13:37,077 --> 01:13:38,544
So where are you gonna go?

1433
01:13:38,546 --> 01:13:41,416
The direction's
the destination. West.

1434
01:13:43,717 --> 01:13:46,050
West is that way.

1435
01:13:46,052 --> 01:13:50,589
Yeah. Anyway, like the title of
a great Phil Collins song:

1436
01:13:50,591 --> 01:13:54,226
"If You Love Somebody,
Set Them Free."

1437
01:13:54,228 --> 01:13:56,661
- Pretty sure that wasn't him.
- Pretty sure it was.

1438
01:13:56,663 --> 01:13:58,965
- No, it was someone else.
- Pretty sure it was him.

1439
01:14:00,935 --> 01:14:02,701
Yeah. Peace.

1440
01:14:02,703 --> 01:14:07,304
Uh, I'm not much
for goodbyes, so...

1441
01:14:07,306 --> 01:14:08,973
Just don't say
the pig thing.

1442
01:14:08,975 --> 01:14:11,076
Keep your tits dry.

1443
01:14:11,078 --> 01:14:13,478
- Oh, okay.
- Didn't see that coming, right?

1444
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:15,412
I would've rather
the pig thing.

1445
01:14:20,154 --> 01:14:21,155
Hey.

1446
01:14:22,588 --> 01:14:25,025
Hey, don't do nothing
I wouldn't not do.

1447
01:14:26,627 --> 01:14:28,826
- You get what I'm saying.
- Not really, no.

1448
01:14:28,828 --> 01:14:30,428
No? Okay.

1449
01:14:31,564 --> 01:14:34,434
Anyway, gonna miss you guys.

1450
01:14:42,810 --> 01:14:44,942
I will never forget you,
what's-his-name.

1451
01:14:44,944 --> 01:14:47,144
- See you, pals.
- It's Tallahassee. I told you.

1452
01:14:47,146 --> 01:14:48,914

There it is. Let's start again.

1464
01:15:54,948 --> 01:15:56,815
Oh, it's all right.
I got it.

1465
01:15:56,817 --> 01:15:59,018
Excuse me. Yes. I got it.

1466
01:15:59,020 --> 01:16:01,186
- You're supposed to kick it back.
- Really?

1467
01:16:01,188 --> 01:16:04,158
- You never seen hacky sack?
- I thought it's like hopscotch.

1468
01:16:05,826 --> 01:16:08,492
- Salty Taffy's back!
- Holy shit!

1469
01:16:08,494 --> 01:16:11,995
Hey, T-800s, a whole swarm
of them, heading right this way.

1470
01:16:11,997 --> 01:16:16,267
Those goddamn fireworks
might as well be a dinner bell!

1471
01:16:16,269 --> 01:16:18,870
Stop the fireworks!
Stop the music!

1472
01:16:18,872 --> 01:16:20,839
Everybody shut the fuck up!

1473
01:16:20,841 --> 01:16:21,940
Shut up.

1474
01:16:21,942 --> 01:16:23,607
Question:

1475
01:16:23,609 --> 01:16:26,244
Did you melt all the weapons?

1476
01:16:26,246 --> 01:16:28,713
Yeah, that's how we made
these peace thingies.

1477
01:16:28,715 --> 01:16:30,648
- Oh, Jesus.
- My guns!

1478
01:16:30,650 --> 01:16:32,750
Hey. Hello.
I got something going.

1479
01:16:32,752 --> 01:16:34,585
I think I might have a plan.

1480
01:16:34,587 --> 01:16:36,754
- Oh.
- What?

1481
01:16:36,756 --> 01:16:39,691
Heh, I got nothing.
I'm just a songwriter.

1482
01:16:39,693 --> 01:16:41,559
No. No, you're
a song transcriber.

1483
01:16:41,561 --> 01:16:43,394
- Listen, Berkeley?
- Yeah?

1484
01:16:43,396 --> 01:16:45,229
I don't think this
is gonna work out.

1485
01:16:45,231 --> 01:16:46,731
Even 12-year-olds know

1486
01:16:46,733 --> 01:16:49,067
who Bob Dylan is,
you fucking poser.

1487
01:16:49,069 --> 01:16:52,204
Oh, my God. I'm not gonna lie,
I have truly enjoyed

1488
01:16:52,206 --> 01:16:54,873
this moment, but there
are zombies approaching.

1489
01:16:54,875 --> 01:16:59,009
Okay. Uh, Civil War general,
you must know how to fight?

1490
01:16:59,011 --> 01:17:00,277
Sure.

1491
01:17:00,279 --> 01:17:03,882
Poverty, sexism,
social injustice.

1492
01:17:03,884 --> 01:17:06,351
- We could try running.
- I'm done running.

1493
01:17:06,353 --> 01:17:09,487
I mean, what good is a home
if you can't stay in it?

1494
01:17:09,489 --> 01:17:12,055
- Columbus.
- Yes, Thor?

1495
01:17:12,057 --> 01:17:13,791
You're gonna make me
cry right now.

1496
01:17:13,793 --> 01:17:15,293
- No, please don't.
- Oh, my God.

1497
01:17:15,295 --> 01:17:17,161
Okay. I moved through it.

1498
01:17:17,163 --> 01:17:19,798
From where I stand, there's
only one thing we can do.

1499
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:21,502
Group sex.
Right?

1500
01:17:22,935 --> 01:17:24,704
No. Um...

1501
01:17:26,006 --> 01:17:28,171
We'll fight them.

1502
01:17:28,173 --> 01:17:31,476
You'll be the first to die,
but I like your enthusiasm.

1503
01:17:31,478 --> 01:17:34,047
- You might die.
- Thank you for your sacrifice.

1504
01:17:37,417 --> 01:17:39,651
All right,
everybody, listen up.

1505
01:17:39,653 --> 01:17:43,588
They outnumber us 100 times,
but they ain't got what we do.

1506
01:17:43,590 --> 01:17:45,290
- Guns?
- We don't have guns.

1507
01:17:45,292 --> 01:17:46,857
- What?
- What we do have

1508
01:17:46,859 --> 01:17:50,294
is heart, brains
and biodiesel.

1509
01:17:50,296 --> 01:17:52,030
<i>We're gonna light
these zombies up</i>

1510
01:17:52,032 --> 01:17:54,098
<i>like it's the Fourth of July.</i>

1511
01:17:54,100 --> 01:17:55,866
<i>Then we hit the stragglers.</i>

1512
01:17:55,868 --> 01:17:58,336
What we do is
we form a gauntlet.

1513
01:17:59,838 --> 01:18:02,139
One, two, three, yah!

1514
01:18:02,141 --> 01:18:04,643
- Then we mop them up.
- Sick.

1515
01:18:04,645 --> 01:18:07,544
- This is gonna work, right?
- It has to.

1516
01:18:17,757 --> 01:18:18,992
- Rolling. Whoa!
- Whoa, whoa!

1517
01:18:25,298 --> 01:18:26,664
- Keep screwing.
- Yeah, I am.

1518
01:18:26,666 --> 01:18:28,302
- Keep screwing.
- I am.

1519
01:18:42,983 --> 01:18:44,348
No turning back now.

1520
01:18:44,350 --> 01:18:47,119
Okay, there we go.

1521
01:18:47,121 --> 01:18:48,221
Nice.

1522
01:18:51,358 --> 01:18:53,458
Yeah. Oh, that's gonna work.

1523
01:18:55,828 --> 01:18:57,161
- Oh!
- Oh, that's pretty.

1524
01:18:57,163 --> 01:18:58,830
That means the zombies
are coming!

1525
01:18:58,832 --> 01:19:00,531
The zombies are coming!

1526
01:19:00,533 --> 01:19:03,404
- Time to nut up or shut up.
- You need a new line.

1527
01:19:04,970 --> 01:19:06,737
Let's kick some dicks.

1528
01:19:06,739 --> 01:19:09,674
Just because it rhymes doesn't
make it a great catchphrase.

1529
01:19:09,676 --> 01:19:11,308
- What's her problem?
- I don't know.

1530
01:19:11,310 --> 01:19:13,113
I like it when it rhymes.

1531
01:19:14,581 --> 01:19:16,880
- Here we go.
- Okay.

1532
01:19:33,632 --> 01:19:35,400
- Zombies, they're coming!
- Oh, dear.

1533
01:19:35,402 --> 01:19:37,802
Look out, guys!
Here they come. They're coming!

1534
01:19:37,804 --> 01:19:38,972
Battle stations!

1535
01:19:42,609 --> 01:19:43,609
Light them up!

1536
01:20:00,060 --> 01:20:02,596
Let's go, let's go!
Get up to safety.

1537
01:20:17,877 --> 01:20:19,313
Here we go.

1538
01:20:31,591 --> 01:20:33,959
Okay now, blow!

1539
01:20:33,961 --> 01:20:38,228
Come on. Now would be
an ideal time to blow.

1540
01:20:38,230 --> 01:20:40,667
- It's not working.
- Damn!

1541
01:20:46,573 --> 01:20:47,604
God!

1542
01:20:47,606 --> 01:20:49,139
Holy shit.
It worked.

1543
01:20:49,141 --> 01:20:51,476
- Oh, my God.
- Okay.

1544
01:20:51,478 --> 01:20:53,745
Okay. Here, now we
mop up the stragglers.

1545
01:20:53,747 --> 01:20:55,347
Okay. Yeah.

1546
01:20:58,752 --> 01:21:00,084
Oh, shit.

1547
01:21:00,086 --> 01:21:01,986
Would those be
considered stragglers?

1548
01:21:01,988 --> 01:21:03,823
Oh, boy. Here they come.

1549
01:21:05,158 --> 01:21:06,727
Get ready!

1550
01:21:16,737 --> 01:21:19,804
Kill those motherfuckers!

1551
01:21:34,054 --> 01:21:37,487
Well, guys, I hate to say this.

1552
01:21:37,489 --> 01:21:39,859
I think this might be
the end of the road.

1553
01:21:42,694 --> 01:21:44,227
- Come here.
- I love you guys.

1554
01:21:44,229 --> 01:21:46,199
- I love you more.
- We had a hell of a run.

1555
01:21:49,002 --> 01:21:50,471
Oh, my God.
They're gonna die.

1556
01:22:02,282 --> 01:22:03,417
Oh!

1557
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:07,788
Hey!

1558
01:22:14,728 --> 01:22:17,227
Sunday, Sunday, Sunday!

1559
01:22:17,229 --> 01:22:19,132
Thank God for rednecks!

1560
01:22:27,707 --> 01:22:29,374
- Need a ride?
- Oh, yeah.

1561
01:22:29,376 --> 01:22:30,811
- Get in.
- Let's go!

1562
01:22:34,913 --> 01:22:38,282
- Are y'all strapped in yet?
- Yep. Strapping in now.

1563
01:22:38,284 --> 01:22:40,218
- Rule four. Got it.
- You too.

1564
01:22:40,220 --> 01:22:42,923
I'm not a pussy like Columbus.
Nothing personal.

1565
01:22:44,356 --> 01:22:45,757
- Oh, God!
- Shit!

1566
01:22:45,759 --> 01:22:47,261
- Seatbelts are for a reason.
- Yep.

1567
01:22:51,396 --> 01:22:53,196
I'm feeling
a little nauseous.

1568
01:22:53,198 --> 01:22:55,767
- Can somebody crack a window?
- Oh, no, you don't.

1569
01:22:55,769 --> 01:22:57,468
Whoa!

1570
01:22:57,470 --> 01:22:59,137
- Roll down the window.
- That won't...

1571
01:22:59,139 --> 01:23:01,141
If you get sick,
we all get sick.

1572
01:23:02,943 --> 01:23:04,808
Woo-hoo!

1573
01:23:04,810 --> 01:23:06,644
Okay, okay. Oh, God.

1574
01:23:06,646 --> 01:23:08,780
Could you pull over
so I can get eaten?

1575
01:23:08,782 --> 01:23:10,016
It'll be more comfortable.

1576
01:23:13,453 --> 01:23:15,821
Whoo!

1577
01:23:15,823 --> 01:23:17,191
- Oh, shit. Watch out!
- Do it!

1578
01:23:22,595 --> 01:23:23,696
Woo-hoo!

1579
01:23:25,832 --> 01:23:28,532
Oh, my God, you are sexy.

1580
01:23:28,534 --> 01:23:31,171
Can you not say "sexy"?
I'm already nauseous.

1581
01:23:36,510 --> 01:23:39,413
Shit, Shit, shit!
Oh, shit.

1582
01:23:40,646 --> 01:23:41,778
Shit.

1583
01:23:41,780 --> 01:23:43,214
- Shit!
- You guys okay?

1584
01:23:43,216 --> 01:23:44,982
Thank you for flying
Big Fat Death.

1585

Let's go! Let's go!
Let's go!

1586
01:23:46,452 --> 01:23:48,652
I told you these things
were a rollover risk!

1587
01:23:48,654 --> 01:23:50,321
- We gotta move!
- Come on!

1588
01:23:50,323 --> 01:23:53,191
Hurry! Hurry! They're coming!

1589
01:23:53,193 --> 01:23:55,160
- Oh, no!
- Come on! Here they come!

1590
01:23:55,162 --> 01:23:56,697
- Go, go, go!
- Shit.

1591
01:23:57,831 --> 01:23:59,196
- Come on!
- Oh, shit!

1592
01:23:59,198 --> 01:24:01,633
Come on!

1593
01:24:01,635 --> 01:24:03,003
- Oh, shit!
- Shit!

1594
01:24:05,305 --> 01:24:06,305
Whoa!

1595
01:24:11,478 --> 01:24:12,510
- Thank you.
- Thank you!

1596
01:24:12,512 --> 01:24:14,245
- Oh, my God!
- Yes!

1597
01:24:14,247 --> 01:24:15,847
Here they come!

1598
01:24:20,654 --> 01:24:22,456
- Go, get in. Go, go, go!
- Go, go, go!

1599
01:24:26,292 --> 01:24:27,292
Run!

1600
01:24:30,329 --> 01:24:33,399
- I'm out of bullets!
- Guys, go! I'm right behind you!

1601
01:24:36,502 --> 01:24:39,572
Get in position! Form the
gauntlet! I'll hold them off!

I'm losing my grip.

This human chain thing

- Guh!
- I can't reach.

1633
01:27:10,390 --> 01:27:12,223
Kick it, kick it. I got it.

1634
01:27:12,225 --> 01:27:13,857
Pull, pull.

1635
01:27:13,859 --> 01:27:15,826
Okay. I got you.

1636
01:27:15,828 --> 01:27:17,160
Okay.

1637
01:27:17,162 --> 01:27:19,362
Oh, man. Are you okay?

1638
01:27:19,364 --> 01:27:21,232
- Yeah.

Oh... Thank you.

Hey.

01:27:28,407 --> 01:27:29,874
You kept the gun?

1642
01:27:29,876 --> 01:27:32,343
How could I give up
my favorite Christmas present?

1643
01:27:32,345 --> 01:27:34,044
Why didn't you
pull it out sooner?

1644
01:27:34,046 --> 01:27:36,613
I forget about it but...
I smoked a lot of weed.

Yes.

01:27:45,257 --> 01:27:47,627
Yes?
Oh, yes, yes?

1648
01:27:48,761 --> 01:27:49,761
Yes, yes.

1649
01:27:51,297 --> 01:27:52,463
Yes, yes, yes?

1650
01:27:52,465 --> 01:27:54,365
- Yes. Yes.
- Yes?

01:27:54,367 --> 01:27:55,435
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

1652
01:27:57,871 --> 01:27:59,637
What changed your mind?

1653
01:27:59,639 --> 01:28:02,342
Because Zombieland or not,
we're meant to be together.

1654
01:28:05,779 --> 01:28:10,581
So basically, that means
this belongs to her.

Oh, hm. Cool.

1656

- Yeah.

1659
01:28:21,127 --> 01:28:22,460
- Okay. I'm good.
- Okay.

1660
01:28:22,462 --> 01:28:24,963
- Yeah, do the damn thing. Yeah.
- Okay.

1661
01:28:24,965 --> 01:28:28,132
- Great. Which hand do I...?
- This one.

1662
01:28:28,134 --> 01:28:29,502
- Okay.
- Okay, yes. Here we go.

1663
01:28:34,039 --> 01:28:35,442
Wow.

1664
01:28:36,643 --> 01:28:37,911
Come here.

1665
01:28:42,414 --> 01:28:44,616
Nicely done.

1666
01:28:44,618 --> 01:28:48,585
I'm gonna walk that little
spitfuck down the aisle.

1667
01:28:48,587 --> 01:28:51,255
It's a good thing
you didn't die, then.

1668
01:28:51,257 --> 01:28:52,525
Washoe County.

1669
01:28:55,094 --> 01:28:57,928
- What?
- Washoe County, Nevada.

1670
01:28:57,930 --> 01:28:59,796
Ah, Reno.

1671
01:28:59,798 --> 01:29:01,702

01:29:09,242 --> 01:29:10,508

1673
01:29:10,510 --> 01:29:12,242
- Sweet.
- Oh, my God.

1674
01:29:13,578 --> 01:29:14,678
What? What?

1675
01:29:14,680 --> 01:29:16,216
- Oh, my gosh!
- Shit!

1676
01:29:21,253 --> 01:29:24,955
- Homer. It's a long way down.
- Our work here is done.

1677
01:29:24,957 --> 01:29:26,522
Let's party!

1678
01:29:26,524 --> 01:29:27,993
- Come on!
- Yeah!

1679
01:29:29,162 --> 01:29:30,361
Wait for me.

1680
01:29:53,219 --> 01:29:58,321
Hell, this is
a 1955 Fleetwood Series 60. Hoo!

1681
01:29:58,323 --> 01:30:02,527
Every hair on my body
feels like a little wang.

1682
01:30:02,529 --> 01:30:04,896
- Yikes.
- Where to?

1683
01:30:04,898 --> 01:30:07,330
Mm, how about home?

1684
01:30:07,332 --> 01:30:08,432
Home?

1685
01:30:08,434 --> 01:30:09,569
- Yeah.
- Yes, good idea.

1686
01:30:11,570 --> 01:30:12,605
Where's home?

1687
01:30:14,239 --> 01:30:17,008
I think we're already there.

1688
01:30:17,010 --> 01:30:18,710
<i>Because if our adventures</i>

1689
01:30:18,712 --> 01:30:21,378
<i>had taught us about anything,
it was home.</i>

1690
01:30:21,380 --> 01:30:23,546
<i>Wichita didn't need
to be afraid of it.</i>

1691
01:30:23,548 --> 01:30:25,581
<i>I didn't need
to keep looking for it.</i>

1692
01:30:25,583 --> 01:30:29,387
<i>Because home isn't a place,
it's the people you're with.</i>

1693
01:30:29,389 --> 01:30:31,688
<i>I guess that's why
they're called your homies.</i>

1694
01:30:31,690 --> 01:30:33,924
<i>And my homies
are pretty fucking awesome.</i>

1695
01:30:33,926 --> 01:30:36,527
<i>So till next time,

1710
01:31:26,112 --> 01:31:27,477
Welcome, everyone,

1711
01:31:27,479 --> 01:31:29,613
to the <i>Garfield 3: Flabby Tabby</i>
junket.

1712
01:31:29,615 --> 01:31:31,148
You'll each have five minutes.

1713
01:31:31,150 --> 01:31:33,451
Please keep your questions
focused on the film

1714
01:31:33,453 --> 01:31:35,152
and don't go off-topic.

1715
01:31:35,154 --> 01:31:37,321
<i>The idea of a
trilogy was something...</i>

1716
01:31:37,323 --> 01:31:40,790
As an artist,
you think the great ones:

1717
01:31:40,792 --> 01:31:42,759
<i>Godfather</i> and...

1718
01:31:42,761 --> 01:31:44,861
uh, <i>Lethal Weapon.</i>

1719
01:31:44,863 --> 01:31:48,699
But the question is,
why in the world <i>Garfield 3?</i>

1720
01:31:48,701 --> 01:31:51,000
- Can this be just between us?
- Yes.

1721
01:31:51,002 --> 01:31:53,036
Drugs cost money.

1722
01:31:53,038 --> 01:31:54,772
And I have to say,
as an actor,

1723
01:31:54,774 --> 01:31:57,473
how many of your nine lives
do you think you have left?

1724
01:31:57,475 --> 01:32:01,012
Well, I've done three of these.
Three <i>Garfields.</i>

1725
01:32:01,014 --> 01:32:02,312
So that's six.

1726
01:32:02,314 --> 01:32:04,281
The essence of Garfield,
I think...

1727
01:32:04,283 --> 01:32:05,348
Right.

1728
01:32:05,350 --> 01:32:07,550
...is the hairball.

1729
01:32:07,552 --> 01:32:10,019
Didn't I say? I had a feeling
this would come up.

1730
01:32:10,021 --> 01:32:11,992
Can you give me a hairball?

1731
01:32:14,527 --> 01:32:16,727
You don't wanna do the hairball
really quick?

1732
01:32:16,729 --> 01:32:18,495
- No.
- Can you try now?

1733
01:32:18,497 --> 01:32:21,065
- Give me a little hairball now?
- Come on.

1734
01:32:23,868 --> 01:32:24,938
Come on.

1735
01:32:30,877 --> 01:32:33,009
You know, how about if I
did it with you?

1736
01:32:33,011 --> 01:32:35,012
- Okay. Come on. Come on.
- That was close.

1737
01:32:35,014 --> 01:32:36,580
We'll do a selfie together.

1738
01:32:38,484 --> 01:32:39,916
Great. Great.

1739
01:32:42,954 --> 01:32:44,722
You all right, man?

1740
01:32:45,791 --> 01:32:47,023
All over the mike.

1741
01:32:47,025 --> 01:32:48,625
Can we get a baby wipe
for Al?

1742
01:32:48,627 --> 01:32:50,393
Maybe move him back
to his room?

1743
01:32:57,136 --> 01:32:58,905
Huge fan, Mr. Roker.

1744
01:33:01,239 --> 01:33:03,374
All right, Tim,
let's get out of here.

1745
01:33:03,376 --> 01:33:05,375
Somebody get my car.
I'm ready to go.

1746
01:33:05,377 --> 01:33:07,376
I've never seen Roker
behave that way.

1747
01:33:07,378 --> 01:33:08,745
That was crazy.

1748
01:33:08,747 --> 01:33:10,815
Sometimes it feels like
you against the world.

1749
01:33:10,817 --> 01:33:12,249
- Oh, my God.
- I think it is.

1750
01:33:18,423 --> 01:33:19,555
