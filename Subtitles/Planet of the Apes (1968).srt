2
00:00:20,336 --> 00:00:24,272
That completes my final
report until we touch down.

3
00:00:24,374 --> 00:00:27,741
We're on full automatic, in
the hands of the computers.

4
00:00:27,844 --> 00:00:35,114
l've tucked my crew in for the long
sleep, and l'll be joining them soon.

5
00:00:35,218 --> 00:00:39,450
ln less than an hour we'll finish
our sixth month out of Cape Kennedy.

6
00:00:39,556 --> 00:00:44,858
Six months in deep space.
By our time, that is.

7
00:00:44,928 --> 00:00:50,195
According to Dr Hasslein's theory of time in
a vehicle traveling nearly the speed of light,

8
00:00:50,266 --> 00:00:55,568
the Earth has aged nearly
700 years since we left it,

9
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:58,766
while we've aged hardly at all.

10
00:01:00,744 --> 00:01:04,578
lt may be so. This
much is probably true.

11
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:09,277
The men who sent us on this journey
are long since dead and gone.

12
00:01:09,385 --> 00:01:13,321
You who are reading me
now are a different breed.

13
00:01:13,423 --> 00:01:15,983
l hope a better one.

14
00:01:16,092 --> 00:01:21,394
l leave the 20th century with
no regrets. But one more thing...

15
00:01:21,464 --> 00:01:23,625
lf anybody's listening, that is.

16
00:01:23,733 --> 00:01:27,260
Nothing scientific.
lt's purely personal.

17
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:33,969
Seen from out here,
everything seems different.

18
00:01:34,077 --> 00:01:38,571
Time bends. Space is boundless.

19
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:41,673
lt squashes a man's ego.

20
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:45,480
l feel lonely.

21
00:01:53,763 --> 00:01:56,459
That's about it.

22
00:01:57,834 --> 00:02:00,598
Tell me, though...

23
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:03,537
Does man, that marvel of the universe,

24
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,201
that glorious paradox who
has sent me to the stars,

25
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:14,341
still make war against his brother,
keep his neighbor's children starving?

26
00:07:15,785 --> 00:07:18,481
Are you all right?

27
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:27,120
Stewart?

28
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:30,623
Stewart?

29
00:07:50,019 --> 00:07:55,355
We're in the soup. She's sinking.
Dodge, read the atmosphere.

30
00:08:10,006 --> 00:08:13,066
Landon, get out a last signal.

31
00:08:13,809 --> 00:08:18,473
- What signal?
- To Earth. That we've landed.

32
00:09:00,356 --> 00:09:05,859
The air's OK. Blow the hatch
before we lose all our power.

33
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:18,573
- lt's no use. The power's gone.
- Forget it. Abandon ship.

34
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,014
She's sinking.

35
00:11:10,186 --> 00:11:12,916
Going...

36
00:11:13,723 --> 00:11:15,247
Going...

37
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:19,686
Gone.

38
00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:27,863
OK. We're here to stay.

39
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:44,849
Well, where are we? Do you
have any notion, skipper?

40
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,411
We're 320 light years from Earth

41
00:11:47,523 --> 00:11:52,756
on an unnamed planet in orbit around
a star in the constellation of Orion.

42
00:11:52,862 --> 00:11:55,524
ls that close enough for you?

43
00:11:56,732 --> 00:12:01,396
- That could be Bellatrix.
- lt's too white for Bellatrix.

44
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:06,601
You didn't have time to read the
tapes. So you really don't know, do you?

45
00:12:06,709 --> 00:12:11,612
What went wrong? We weren't
programmed to land in the water.

46
00:12:12,114 --> 00:12:16,073
The question is not so much
where we are as when we are.

47
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:21,988
We've had enough sleep for a while.
Let's start earning all that back pay.

48
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:02,956
Dodge, run your soil test.

49
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,628
- Got your sensors?
- Right.

50
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:10,331
- Geiger counter?
- Got it.

51
00:13:12,775 --> 00:13:19,977
Let's see... One pistol, 20 rounds
ammo, a medical kit, camera, TX9.

52
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:24,281
We've got food and water
enough for three days.

53
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:28,550
- How long is a day?
- That's a good question.

54
00:13:28,657 --> 00:13:30,318
Landon...

55
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:32,383
Hey, Landon.

56
00:13:32,495 --> 00:13:35,225
Join the expedition.

57
00:13:37,366 --> 00:13:41,462
Sorry. l was thinking about Stewart.
What do you suppose happened?

58
00:13:41,537 --> 00:13:45,633
- Air leak. She died in her sleep.
- You don't seem very cut up about it.

59
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:50,475
lt's a little late for a wake.
She's been dead nearly a year.

60
00:13:50,546 --> 00:13:53,572
That means we've been away
from Earth for 18 months.

61
00:13:53,682 --> 00:13:55,741
Our time.

62
00:13:56,719 --> 00:13:59,210
You've gone gray.

63
00:14:00,155 --> 00:14:05,650
Apart from that you look pretty
chipper for a man who's 2,031 years old.

64
00:14:05,728 --> 00:14:08,697
l read the clocks. They bear
out Hasslein's hypothesis.

65
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:14,725
We have been away from Earth for
2,000 years, give or take a decade.

66
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:21,202
Still can't accept it? Time's
wiped out everything you ever knew.

67
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:24,769
- lt's all dust.
- Prove it.

68
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:31,911
- lf we can't get back, it's still just a theory.
- lt's a fact, Landon. Buy it. You'll sleep better.

69
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,382
Nothing will grow here. There's
just a trace of carbohydrates.

70
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:40,690
All the nitrogen is
locked into the nitrates.

71
00:14:40,763 --> 00:14:43,425
- No dangerous ionization?
- No.

72
00:14:44,533 --> 00:14:46,296
Well...

73
00:14:46,402 --> 00:14:50,771
lf there's no life here, we've
gotjust 72 hours to find it.

74
00:14:50,873 --> 00:14:56,038
That's when the groceries run
out. Let's go. Which direction?

75
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:01,480
- That way.
- Any particular reason?

76
00:15:01,584 --> 00:15:03,643
None at all.

77
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:08,589
Come on...

78
00:17:58,293 --> 00:18:00,386
Everybody all right?

79
00:18:01,597 --> 00:18:03,656
Water check.

80
00:18:11,774 --> 00:18:13,935
Eight ounces.

81
00:18:19,915 --> 00:18:26,150
lt doesn't add up. Thunder and lightning,
and no rain. Cloud cover at night.

82
00:18:26,255 --> 00:18:31,318
- That strange luminosity, yet no moon.
- lf we could just get a fix.

83
00:18:31,426 --> 00:18:35,419
What would that tell you? l've told
you where you are and when you are.

84
00:18:35,497 --> 00:18:37,021
All right, all right.

85
00:18:37,132 --> 00:18:41,694
You're 300 light years
from your precious planet.

86
00:18:41,804 --> 00:18:45,535
Your loved ones are dead and
forgotten for 20 centuries.

87
00:18:45,641 --> 00:18:50,601
20. Even if you could get back, they'd think
you were something that fell out of a tree.

88
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:53,204
Taylor, quit riding him.

89
00:18:53,315 --> 00:18:55,875
There is just one reality.
We are here and it is now.

90
00:18:55,984 --> 00:18:59,545
You get hold of that, or
you might as well be dead.

91
00:18:59,655 --> 00:19:02,614
l'm prepared to die.

92
00:19:03,692 --> 00:19:06,286
He's prepared to die.

93
00:19:06,361 --> 00:19:12,527
Doesn't that make you misty? Chalk up
another victory for the human spirit.

94
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:23,875
Clue me in on something, will you?
Why did you sign on for this trip?

95
00:19:23,979 --> 00:19:26,504
You volunteered. Why?

96
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:31,986
Never mind. l'll clue you in. You were
the golden boy of the class of '72.

97
00:19:32,054 --> 00:19:34,989
When they nominated you,
you couldn't turn it down.

98
00:19:35,057 --> 00:19:38,322
Not without losing
your all-American image.

99
00:19:38,393 --> 00:19:43,092
- Climb off, will you?
- And the glory. Don't forget that.

100
00:19:43,198 --> 00:19:48,101
There's a life-size bronze statue
of you standing out there somewhere.

101
00:19:48,203 --> 00:19:52,003
Probably turned green by now and
nobody can read the nameplate.

102
00:19:52,074 --> 00:19:56,602
- But never let it be said we forget our heroes.
- Taylor, climb off my back.

103
00:19:56,712 --> 00:20:02,082
And there's one last item. lmmortality.
You wanted to live for ever, didn't you?

104
00:20:02,184 --> 00:20:08,919
Well, you damn near made it. Except for me and
Dodge, you've lived longer than anyone ever born.

105
00:20:09,024 --> 00:20:16,123
And with our lovely Lieutenant Stewart dead,
it looks like you're the last of the line.

106
00:20:17,065 --> 00:20:21,468
You got what you wanted,
tiger. How does it taste?

107
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:25,904
OK. You read me well enough.
But why can't l read you?

108
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:28,067
Don't bother.

109
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:33,775
Dodge, there. He's not like
me at all. But he makes sense.

110
00:20:33,882 --> 00:20:40,048
He'd walk naked into a live volcano if he thought
he could learn something that no other man knew.

111
00:20:40,122 --> 00:20:44,752
But you... You're no
seeker. You're negative.

112
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:49,092
- And l'm not prepared to die.
- l'd like to know why not.

113
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:56,772
You thought life on Earth was meaningless. You despised people.
- So what did you do? You ran out.

114
00:20:56,772 --> 00:21:03,270
- No. lt's not like that, Landon.l'm a
seeker too. But my dreams aren't like yours.

115
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:09,750
l can't help thinking somewhere there has
to be something better than man. Has to be.

116
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,113
Taylor, over here.

117
00:21:53,628 --> 00:21:55,687
Life.

118
00:22:09,378 --> 00:22:14,509
Where there's one, there's
another. And another and another.

119
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,676
Let's find 'em.

120
00:24:51,373 --> 00:24:53,500
Skipper.

121
00:24:54,509 --> 00:24:56,568
Look.

122
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:14,186
Scarecrows?

123
00:25:15,163 --> 00:25:17,222
Let's see.

124
00:26:02,777 --> 00:26:04,870
To hell with the scarecrows.

125
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,948
Whoo-hoo.

126
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:51,117
Hey. Yay. Yay.

127
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:01,301
Ah.

128
00:27:02,604 --> 00:27:05,004
Ah-hoo.

129
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:09,138
Whoo. Whoo.

130
00:27:17,952 --> 00:27:19,476
Ah.

131
00:27:27,128 --> 00:27:29,323
Taylor.

132
00:27:30,298 --> 00:27:32,789
Look at this.

133
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,324
Taylor, look.

134
00:29:44,432 --> 00:29:47,367
They didn't leave much, did they?

135
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:22,302
- Well, at least they haven't tried to bite us.
- Blessed are the vegetarians.

136
00:30:28,977 --> 00:30:34,347
They look more or less human,
but l think they're mute.

137
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:45,659
We got off at the wrong stop.

138
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:51,858
You're supposed to be the optimist,
Landon. Look on the bright side.

139
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:59,362
lf this is the best they've got around here,
in six months we'll be running this planet.

140
00:35:59,207 --> 00:36:01,971
Smile.

141
00:36:40,514 --> 00:36:43,915
Which one was wearing
the strange clothes?

142
00:36:44,018 --> 00:36:46,077
This one.

143
00:36:48,756 --> 00:36:52,089
- Will he live?
- l don't know.

144
00:36:52,193 --> 00:36:55,629
This beast has lost a lot of blood.

145
00:37:01,736 --> 00:37:05,900
- There's no probe here. Find one.
- Yes, sir.

146
00:37:06,274 --> 00:37:12,076
This place is dirty, doctor.
Doctor, these animals are dirty.

147
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:17,140
They stink. They carry diseases. Why aren't
they cleaned up before they're brought here?

148
00:37:17,251 --> 00:37:22,814
- You don't sound happy in your work.
- l'm little more than a vet in this laboratory.

149
00:37:22,924 --> 00:37:25,654
You promised to speak
to Dr Zaius about me.

150
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,787
l did. You know how he looks
down his nose at chimpanzees.

151
00:37:29,897 --> 00:37:33,628
But the quota system's been
abolished. You made it. Why can't l?

152
00:37:33,734 --> 00:37:39,639
What do you mean
- made it? l'm an animal psychologist, that's all. We have no authority.

153
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:42,470
You do all right getting
space and equipment.

154
00:37:42,576 --> 00:37:47,172
That's because Dr Zaius
realizes our work has value.

155
00:37:47,281 --> 00:37:51,183
The foundations of scientific brain
surgery are being laid right here

156
00:37:51,285 --> 00:37:55,654
in studies of cerebral
functions of these animals.

157
00:37:55,756 --> 00:38:01,786
They're still dirty, doctor. And their
bite is septic. There. Look at that.

158
00:38:03,497 --> 00:38:05,590
Hold his jaw.

159
00:38:30,324 --> 00:38:33,816
- Good morning, Dr Zira.
- Morning, Julius. How's our patient?

160
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:37,625
No change. The minute you open
the door, he goes into his act.

161
00:38:40,501 --> 00:38:42,162
Well.

162
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:47,037
And what do we want this morning?
Do we want something? Come on. Speak.

163
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:49,967
Come on, speak.

164
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:53,873
Do we want some sugar, old-timer?

165
00:38:55,583 --> 00:39:00,350
- You could get hurt doing that, doctor.
- Don't be silly. He's perfectly tame.

166
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:06,382
- They all are till they take a chunk out of you.
- Well, Bright Eyes. Our throat feeling better?

167
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:12,662
- Still hurts, doesn't it?
- See? He keeps pretending he can talk.

168
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:21,905
That Bright Eyes is remarkable.
He keeps trying to form words.

169
00:39:22,009 --> 00:39:25,843
You know what they say.
Human see, human do.

170
00:39:30,217 --> 00:39:32,276
Now what?

171
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:36,279
He seems to want something.

172
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:39,585
l'd be careful, doctor.

173
00:39:39,693 --> 00:39:43,561
What did l tell you? Try that
again and l'll break your arm!

174
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:48,431
Good morning, Your Excellency.

175
00:39:48,536 --> 00:39:50,595
Dr Zaius.

176
00:39:52,406 --> 00:39:54,465
Good morning, sir.

177
00:39:55,109 --> 00:39:57,202
Open up, please.

178
00:39:57,278 --> 00:39:59,371
l'm so glad you could come.

179
00:39:59,447 --> 00:40:01,540
Sir, he's over here.

180
00:40:03,918 --> 00:40:05,977
Bright Eyes...

181
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:10,920
Show him. Go ahead. Do your trick.

182
00:40:11,292 --> 00:40:14,591
Speak. Go on. Speak again.

183
00:40:17,765 --> 00:40:20,893
There. Can you believe it?

184
00:40:20,968 --> 00:40:24,631
Yes, amusing. A man acting like an ape.

185
00:40:27,475 --> 00:40:34,748
- Dr Zaius, l could swear he's answering you.
- He has a definite gift for mimicry.

186
00:40:34,815 --> 00:40:40,344
Most unusual. He's using
that old blanket as clothing.

187
00:40:40,454 --> 00:40:44,754
l wonder how he'd score on a
Hopkins manual dexterity test.

188
00:40:44,825 --> 00:40:50,127
An animal? Look. He's
moving his fingers.

189
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:56,136
- Only because he saw you moving yours.
- But perhaps he understood.

190
00:40:56,203 --> 00:41:03,439
Man has no understanding. He can be
taught a few simple tricks. Nothing more.

191
00:41:03,511 --> 00:41:06,213
l'm afraid l must disagree.

192
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:11,446
- According to my experiments...
- Dr Zira, l must caution you.

193
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:17,719
Experimental brain surgery on these creatures
is one thing, and l'm in favor of it.

194
00:41:17,825 --> 00:41:21,317
But your behavioral studies
are something else again.

195
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:26,355
To suggest that we can learn
anything about the simian nature

196
00:41:26,467 --> 00:41:29,994
from the study of man is sheer nonsense.

197
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:32,231
Besides, man is a nuisance.

198
00:41:32,339 --> 00:41:36,070
He eats up his food
supplies in the forest,

199
00:41:36,177 --> 00:41:41,046
then migrates to our green
belts and ravages our crops.

200
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:47,480
The sooner he is
exterminated the better.

201
00:41:47,555 --> 00:41:50,854
lt's a question of simian survival.

202
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:08,368
ls this the one you wanted,
doctor? Oh, yes. Thank you.

203
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:12,003
Bright Eyes, l've got a present for you.

204
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:25,717
Put her in with him.

205
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:20,908
Cornelius. Up here.

206
00:43:22,449 --> 00:43:25,247
- Do you have to work tonight?
- No.

207
00:43:25,319 --> 00:43:27,150
Neither do l.

208
00:43:31,292 --> 00:43:33,852
Oh, Cornelius.

209
00:43:49,777 --> 00:43:55,306
There's Bright Eyes. The
one l was telling you about.

210
00:43:55,382 --> 00:43:59,443
- What's so special about him?
- Watch.

211
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:03,217
Hello, Bright Eyes.
How's our throat today?

212
00:44:07,661 --> 00:44:11,062
- Look. She remembers.
- Remembers what?

213
00:44:11,165 --> 00:44:14,225
- The blood transfusion.
- Zira, really.

214
00:44:14,335 --> 00:44:16,462
You know, they can't... Watch out.

215
00:44:16,537 --> 00:44:18,368
Here comes number one.

216
00:44:18,472 --> 00:44:23,739
Something's bothering him. He's been
prying around the lab for the last two days.

217
00:44:23,844 --> 00:44:25,903
Good morning, Dr Zaius.

218
00:44:26,013 --> 00:44:30,040
- You know my... Dr Cornelius, my fiance.
- Of course.

219
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:35,679
The young ape with a shovel. l hear you're
planning another archaeological expedition.

220
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:40,193
- With the Academy's approval, sir.
- The project will require my support.

221
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:44,697
- l hope l may count on it, sir.
- Cornelius, a friendly warning.

222
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:50,704
As you dig for artifacts, be sure
you don't bury your reputation.

223
00:45:02,883 --> 00:45:05,215
Guard.

224
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:06,844
Guard.

225
00:45:29,376 --> 00:45:30,775
Stop.

226
00:45:30,878 --> 00:45:32,937
You'll hurt him.

227
00:45:33,046 --> 00:45:35,412
Take him inside.

228
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:40,545
Cornelius...

229
00:45:40,621 --> 00:45:45,820
lf you have a moment, l'd like to discuss
this expedition of yours in more detail.

230
00:45:45,926 --> 00:45:49,885
Certainly, sir. l'll pick up my
notes and l'll come right over.

231
00:45:49,963 --> 00:45:55,458
l don't understand animal psychologists.
What's Dr Zira trying to prove?

232
00:45:55,569 --> 00:45:58,402
That man can be domesticated.

233
00:46:37,010 --> 00:46:40,446
- What happened?
- Oh, those fools and their torches.

234
00:46:40,514 --> 00:46:43,642
- Do you have any ointment?
- l'll see.

235
00:46:48,322 --> 00:46:50,187
l'm sorry, Bright Eyes.

236
00:46:56,029 --> 00:46:57,018
Julius!

237
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:02,160
l told you what you'd get.

238
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:03,669
Julius, don't, don't, don't.

239
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:05,398
lt doesn't matter.

240
00:47:05,506 --> 00:47:07,565
Julius, don't hurt him.

241
00:47:10,377 --> 00:47:11,537
Julius.

242
00:47:17,985 --> 00:47:21,079
Natural-born thieves, aren't they?

243
00:47:33,490 --> 00:47:37,984
Get me a collar and leash.
l'm taking him out of here.

244
00:47:38,061 --> 00:47:43,089
- He's vicious. Besides, it's against the rules.
- Do as l say!

245
00:47:54,377 --> 00:47:58,370
You... wouldn't hurt me, would you,

246
00:48:01,084 --> 00:48:03,177
Taylor?

247
00:48:19,035 --> 00:48:23,062
lt's a stunt. Humans can't write.

248
00:48:23,139 --> 00:48:28,236
Dear, you're a scientist.
Don't you believe your own eyes?

249
00:48:31,715 --> 00:48:34,047
Where did you learn to do this?

250
00:48:37,253 --> 00:48:39,118
''Jefferson

251
00:48:39,222 --> 00:48:42,157
Public School.''

252
00:48:48,665 --> 00:48:52,328
''Fort Wayne, lndiana.''

253
00:48:55,305 --> 00:48:59,071
- Back on that planet you
say you came from? - Uh-huh.

254
00:49:04,447 --> 00:49:09,180
Maybe he is intelligent.
But he is also... crazy.

255
00:49:09,285 --> 00:49:11,150
Cornelius.

256
00:49:11,254 --> 00:49:13,313
Cornelius, please.

257
00:49:18,294 --> 00:49:24,130
''Dodge was killed in the
hunt. What happened to Landon?''

258
00:49:26,369 --> 00:49:31,329
- l don't know.
- They fell out of the sky with you?

259
00:49:35,879 --> 00:49:40,714
- ''Not fell. Flew.''
- Flight is a scientific impossibility.

260
00:49:40,817 --> 00:49:43,786
And even if it weren't, why fly?

261
00:49:43,853 --> 00:49:46,549
Where would it get you?

262
00:50:02,906 --> 00:50:05,466
''Do you have maps?''

263
00:50:19,723 --> 00:50:22,521
We're here. You were captured here.

264
00:50:25,762 --> 00:50:33,168
You fell into the water here? You
came ashore. Marched across the desert?

265
00:50:33,236 --> 00:50:35,329
Mountains?

266
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:40,904
Many days and nights.
And reached the jungle.

267
00:50:42,112 --> 00:50:45,275
Out of the question.

268
00:50:45,381 --> 00:50:48,908
Cornelius, why do you
insist on provoking him?

269
00:50:49,018 --> 00:50:55,253
No creature can survive in the forbidden
zone. l know. l've been there. l've seen it.

270
00:50:57,060 --> 00:51:01,690
- ''Then how do you account for me?''
- l don't.

271
00:51:02,065 --> 00:51:04,898
And l'm not going to try.

272
00:51:06,269 --> 00:51:13,471
But what about your theory? The existence
of someone like Taylor might prove it.

273
00:51:13,576 --> 00:51:17,307
- You want to get my head chopped off?
- Don't be foolish.

274
00:51:17,413 --> 00:51:22,112
- lf it's true, they'll have to accept it.
- No, they won't.

275
00:51:23,153 --> 00:51:26,316
Cornelius has developed the
most brilliant hypothesis.

276
00:51:26,422 --> 00:51:27,889
But l'm probably wrong.

277
00:51:27,957 --> 00:51:34,419
That the ape evolved from a lower
order of primate, possibly man.

278
00:51:34,497 --> 00:51:41,460
ln the forbidden zone, he discovered traces
of a culture older than recorded time.

279
00:51:41,571 --> 00:51:44,938
- The evidence was meager.
- You didn't think so then.

280
00:51:45,008 --> 00:51:48,910
That was before Dr Zaius and half of
the Academy said my idea was heresy.

281
00:51:48,978 --> 00:51:56,248
How can scientific truth be heresy? What
if Taylor is exactly the proof you needed?

282
00:51:56,319 --> 00:52:03,282
A mutation. A missing link between
the unevolved primate and the ape.

283
00:52:05,595 --> 00:52:07,654
Touchy, isn't he?

284
00:52:08,998 --> 00:52:11,523
''l am not a missing link.''

285
00:52:11,634 --> 00:52:16,003
Well, if he were a missing link, the sacred
scrolls wouldn't be worth their parchment.

286
00:52:16,105 --> 00:52:18,699
Well, maybe they're not.

287
00:52:20,043 --> 00:52:23,171
Oh, no, thank you. l'm not
going to get into that battle.

288
00:52:23,279 --> 00:52:27,272
- Cornelius, show some strength.
- Zira, listen to me.

289
00:52:27,350 --> 00:52:29,614
Now, we both have fine futures.

290
00:52:29,686 --> 00:52:33,782
Marriage, stimulating
careers. l'm up for a raise.

291
00:52:34,991 --> 00:52:36,720
Dr Zaius.

292
00:52:38,194 --> 00:52:43,860
- Did you forget our appointment, Cornelius?
- No, sir. l was just collecting my notes.

293
00:52:43,967 --> 00:52:48,165
You know Dr Maximus, our
commissioner for animal affairs.

294
00:52:48,238 --> 00:52:51,503
Yes, sir. lt's a
pleasure to see you again.

295
00:52:51,574 --> 00:52:55,738
- What is that?
- A man, Dr Maximus.

296
00:52:55,845 --> 00:52:59,406
l know it's a man.
And you know the rules.

297
00:52:59,515 --> 00:53:03,975
No animals allowed outside the
compound, especially not without a leash.

298
00:53:04,053 --> 00:53:09,549
Yes, sir, but this...
creature is a special case.

299
00:53:09,659 --> 00:53:14,323
- Why special?
- We 're conducting a new experiment.

300
00:53:14,397 --> 00:53:18,094
Wouldn't that more properly
be done in your office?

301
00:53:18,201 --> 00:53:19,225
Yes, sir.

302
00:53:19,335 --> 00:53:22,532
Guards, return this
beast to the compound.

303
00:53:24,207 --> 00:53:27,176
What is this?

304
00:53:28,778 --> 00:53:32,714
A toy. lt floats on the air.

305
00:53:32,782 --> 00:53:34,181
Zira...

306
00:53:34,918 --> 00:53:37,716
- Try it.
- Nonsense.

307
00:53:56,105 --> 00:53:59,404
- What's up, lieutenant?
- We're taking number four to surgery.

308
00:53:59,475 --> 00:54:00,908
- Have him ready.
- How come?

309
00:54:00,977 --> 00:54:05,710
- The beast's throat's nearly healed.
- The vet's going to geld him.

310
00:54:05,782 --> 00:54:08,910
Dr Zira won't like it. She
wants that pair to mate.

311
00:54:08,985 --> 00:54:14,582
These orders come from Dr Zaius himself.
There's nothing she can do about it.

312
00:54:29,405 --> 00:54:33,136
lf only you knew what
they're going to do.

313
00:54:34,444 --> 00:54:38,005
Stay still now. Don't
give me any trouble.

314
00:55:10,313 --> 00:55:14,841
Weep if you must, but
make an end of sorrow.

315
00:55:14,951 --> 00:55:17,715
He lives again.

316
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:20,880
Yes, he has found peace in heaven.

317
00:55:22,859 --> 00:55:27,558
He was a model for us
all, a gorilla to remember.

318
00:55:28,498 --> 00:55:32,958
Hunter, warrior, defender of the faith.

319
00:55:34,504 --> 00:55:38,201
Cherished husband, beloved father,

320
00:55:38,307 --> 00:55:40,901
generous master, yes.

321
00:55:42,645 --> 00:55:45,637
He was a font of simian kindness.

322
00:55:47,483 --> 00:55:54,184
The dear departed once said to me
''l never met an ape l didn't like.''

323
00:55:55,191 --> 00:55:57,557
Look. lt's a man.

324
00:55:57,660 --> 00:56:01,027
ln heaven's name. Get
rid of that creature.

325
00:56:01,097 --> 00:56:03,190
Catch him.

326
00:56:06,069 --> 00:56:07,536
Catch him. Catch him.

327
00:57:37,793 --> 00:57:39,852
Come on, Quintus.

328
00:59:51,927 --> 00:59:53,918
- Go get him.
- Taylor.

329
00:59:53,996 --> 00:59:56,487
- Why did you run away?
- Security police.

330
00:59:56,599 --> 00:59:58,567
l'm in charge of this man.

331
00:59:58,634 --> 01:00:01,797
He is in the custody of
the ministry of science.

332
01:00:01,904 --> 01:00:07,103
Take your stinking paws
off me, you damn dirty ape!

333
01:00:16,652 --> 01:00:18,745
No one'll listen to me.

334
01:00:20,856 --> 01:00:22,949
Only you.

335
01:00:25,995 --> 01:00:27,860
You.

336
01:00:28,631 --> 01:00:30,861
Nova.

337
01:00:30,966 --> 01:00:33,526
You Nova.

338
01:00:33,636 --> 01:00:35,695
No...

339
01:00:37,773 --> 01:00:40,469
Yeah. Me Tarzan, you Jane.

340
01:00:48,684 --> 01:00:50,948
What are you doing?

341
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:55,116
Leave her alone, damn you.
Where are you taking her?

342
01:01:04,834 --> 01:01:06,734
Where are you taking her?

343
01:01:20,649 --> 01:01:22,082
Damn you.

344
01:01:22,184 --> 01:01:25,711
- You hairy scum.
- Shut up, you freak.

345
01:01:26,722 --> 01:01:29,418
- Julius, you...
- l said shut up.

346
01:01:29,525 --> 01:01:31,322
lt's a madhouse!

347
01:01:32,328 --> 01:01:34,319
A madhouse!

348
01:01:46,842 --> 01:01:50,369
Now l don't even have you.

349
01:01:50,446 --> 01:01:54,746
lmagine me needing someone.
Back on Earth l never did.

350
01:01:54,850 --> 01:02:00,789
There were women. Lots of women.
Lots of lovemaking, but no love.

351
01:02:00,890 --> 01:02:03,688
That was the kind of world we'd made.

352
01:02:03,759 --> 01:02:08,093
So l left because there
was no one to hold me there.

353
01:02:08,197 --> 01:02:13,294
Did l tell you about Stewart?
Now there was a lovely girl.

354
01:02:13,402 --> 01:02:19,807
The most precious cargo we'd brought
along. She was to be the new Eve.

355
01:02:19,909 --> 01:02:23,367
With our hot and eager help, of course.

356
01:02:25,648 --> 01:02:30,483
Probably just as well she
didn't make it this far.

357
01:02:32,054 --> 01:02:37,424
Do you love me, l wonder?
Can you love, l wonder?

358
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:46,231
Well...

359
01:02:46,302 --> 01:02:51,740
You're not as smart as Stewart,
but you're the only girl in town.

360
01:02:57,346 --> 01:03:02,010
Look at that. l... taught you to smile.

361
01:04:26,769 --> 01:04:32,537
lt's been weeks. What happened? Where have
you been? Why didn't you come to see me?

362
01:04:32,841 --> 01:04:34,433
- What is this?
- A hearing.

363
01:04:34,543 --> 01:04:37,034
- Be clever. Be quiet.
- All rise.

364
01:04:46,922 --> 01:04:49,948
Be seated.

365
01:04:51,293 --> 01:04:54,456
This ad hoc tribunal of the
National Academy is now in session.

366
01:04:54,563 --> 01:04:57,430
The president of the Academy presiding.

367
01:04:57,533 --> 01:05:01,560
On my right, Dr Maximus,
commissioner for animal affairs.

368
01:05:01,637 --> 01:05:07,234
And on my left, Dr Zaius, minister of
science and chief defender of the faith.

369
01:05:07,309 --> 01:05:11,712
And appearing for the state, Dr
Honorious, deputy minister ofjustice.

370
01:05:15,884 --> 01:05:19,786
Bailiff. Your instructions:
to clean up the beast.

371
01:05:19,888 --> 01:05:27,659
These rags he's wearing give off a stench
that's offensive to the dignity of this tribunal.

372
01:05:37,306 --> 01:05:39,672
You may proceed, Dr Honorious.

373
01:05:39,775 --> 01:05:46,977
By your leave, Mr President, this tribunal has
not yet defined the purpose for this inquiry.

374
01:05:48,017 --> 01:05:53,284
You asked for the opportunity to present your
case. Surely you must know why you're here.

375
01:05:53,355 --> 01:05:58,657
At the very least, this man has the right
to know whether there's a charge against him.

376
01:05:58,761 --> 01:06:06,293
Objection. This exhibit is indeed a man.
Therefore he has no rights under ape law.

377
01:06:06,368 --> 01:06:13,433
- Dr Zira, this is a man, is it not?
- He is unlike any man you have ever seen.

378
01:06:13,509 --> 01:06:18,606
- As we hope to prove.
- Answer the question, Dr Zira. ls it a man?

379
01:06:18,681 --> 01:06:22,549
Sir, perhaps the question
is the point at issue.

380
01:06:23,318 --> 01:06:27,448
ls he a man, is he a
deviant, or a freak of nature?

381
01:06:27,523 --> 01:06:29,616
- Objection.
- Sustained.

382
01:06:29,692 --> 01:06:34,211
Now, Dr Zira, in all fairness,
you must admit that the accused

383
01:06:34,211 --> 01:06:38,731
is a non-ape and therefore
has no rights under ape law.

384
01:06:38,834 --> 01:06:45,239
Then why is he called the accused? Your
Honors must think him guilty of something.

385
01:06:46,575 --> 01:06:50,875
The creature's not being
tried. He's being disposed of.

386
01:06:50,979 --> 01:06:56,849
- lt is scientific heresy that is being tried here.
- Well put, Dr Zaius.

387
01:06:57,686 --> 01:07:05,024
Let us warn our friends that they endanger
their own careers by defending this animal.

388
01:07:05,094 --> 01:07:07,062
Then l'll defend myself.

389
01:07:10,833 --> 01:07:15,736
Dr Zira, would you tell...
Bright Eyes to be quiet?

390
01:07:16,338 --> 01:07:20,331
- My name is Taylor.
- Bailiff. Silence the animal.

391
01:07:20,409 --> 01:07:22,843
Wait. Let me...

392
01:07:24,913 --> 01:07:27,211
You may proceed, Mr Prosecutor.

393
01:07:27,282 --> 01:07:33,687
Learned judges, my case is simple. lt
is based on our first article of faith.

394
01:07:33,756 --> 01:07:39,285
That the almighty created the ape in his own
image. That he gave him a soul and a mind.

395
01:07:39,394 --> 01:07:44,855
That he set him apart from the beasts of the
jungle and made him the lord of the planet.

396
01:07:44,933 --> 01:07:48,460
These sacred truths are self-evident.

397
01:07:48,570 --> 01:07:51,869
The proper study of apes is apes.

398
01:07:53,041 --> 01:07:57,146
But certain young cynics
have chosen to study man.

399
01:07:57,146 --> 01:08:02,983
Yes. Perverted scientists who advance
an insidious theory called evolution.

400
01:08:03,085 --> 01:08:06,316
Come to the point, Dr Honorious.

401
01:08:06,421 --> 01:08:10,983
The state charges that Dr Zira
and a corrupt surgeon named Galen

402
01:08:11,093 --> 01:08:16,429
experimented on this wounded animal,
tampering with his brain and throat tissues,

403
01:08:16,498 --> 01:08:18,625
to produce a speaking monster.

404
01:08:18,734 --> 01:08:21,601
- That's a lie!
- Mind your tongue, madam.

405
01:08:21,670 --> 01:08:25,003
Did we create his mind as well?

406
01:08:25,107 --> 01:08:29,441
Not only can this man speak,
he can think. He can reason.

407
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:34,640
That can reason?

408
01:08:34,750 --> 01:08:39,983
With the tribunal's permission, allow me
to expose this hoax by direct examination.

409
01:08:40,088 --> 01:08:45,025
Proceed, doctor. But do not
turn this hearing into a farce.

410
01:08:50,632 --> 01:08:56,127
Tell the court, Bright Eyes, what
is the second article of faith?

411
01:08:56,205 --> 01:08:59,197
l know nothing of your
culture. l admit that.

412
01:08:59,308 --> 01:09:04,803
Of course he doesn't know our
culture, because he cannot think.

413
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:09,681
Tell us, why are all apes created equal?

414
01:09:09,785 --> 01:09:12,379
Some apes, it seems, are
more equal than others.

415
01:09:12,487 --> 01:09:17,857
Ridiculous. Tell us, Bright
Eyes, why do men have no souls?

416
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:23,125
What is the proof that a divine
spark exists in the simian brain?

417
01:09:32,341 --> 01:09:34,741
Read this for me.

418
01:09:44,219 --> 01:09:48,053
Since the defendant has been
forbidden to speak in his own defense,

419
01:09:48,156 --> 01:09:53,025
he requests that the following
statement be read into the record.

420
01:09:53,095 --> 01:09:57,423
You read it, Dr Cornelius. Read it.

421
01:10:00,002 --> 01:10:04,905
''l have come to you from a planet
in a different solar system.''

422
01:10:05,007 --> 01:10:10,604
- ''l am an explorer in space''
- Stop right there. Let me see that paper.

423
01:10:17,286 --> 01:10:21,017
lt's ajoke. ln very poor taste.

424
01:10:21,089 --> 01:10:25,526
- ls it ajoke to seek the truth about this man?
- Dr Zira...

425
01:10:25,594 --> 01:10:31,464
You state here that a ship from outer space
sank in an inland sea of our eastern desert

426
01:10:31,566 --> 01:10:37,027
and that Bright Eyes had two intelligent
companions with him when he was captured.

427
01:10:37,105 --> 01:10:39,767
That is his assertion.

428
01:10:39,875 --> 01:10:46,610
Mr President, in addition to Bright Eyes,
l believe the prosecutor has reassembled

429
01:10:46,715 --> 01:10:50,242
all the surviving humans that
were captured in the hunt.

430
01:10:50,319 --> 01:10:53,254
- That's true, Dr Zaius.
- Very well.

431
01:10:54,389 --> 01:10:58,257
Then l suggest that we
go take a look at them.

432
01:11:36,298 --> 01:11:38,027
That's him. That's Landon.

433
01:11:38,133 --> 01:11:41,261
- Which one?
- The tall one in the back.

434
01:11:43,338 --> 01:11:46,330
You acknowledge kinship
with these creatures?

435
01:11:46,441 --> 01:11:51,469
- With one of them, yes.
- ldentify him, then. Speak to him.

436
01:11:52,481 --> 01:11:54,540
Landon?

437
01:11:55,484 --> 01:11:56,508
Landon.

438
01:12:02,891 --> 01:12:04,984
They cut him!

439
01:12:07,396 --> 01:12:12,629
- Did you know about this?
- No. l swear. l never saw this man before.

440
01:12:13,502 --> 01:12:15,561
But they...

441
01:12:16,705 --> 01:12:22,041
You did it. You cut up his
brain, you bloody baboon.

442
01:12:22,144 --> 01:12:24,203
Stop him.

443
01:12:35,690 --> 01:12:38,022
Take him inside.

444
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:21,528
Mr President, a word of explanation.

445
01:13:21,603 --> 01:13:27,940
The human you saw outside suffered a
skull fracture in the course of the hunt.

446
01:13:28,043 --> 01:13:32,980
Two fine veterinary surgeons under my
direction were able to save his life.

447
01:13:33,081 --> 01:13:37,780
But the beast could not speak,
of course. Nor will he ever speak.

448
01:13:37,886 --> 01:13:42,482
You did that to him, damn you. You
cut out his memory, took his identity.

449
01:13:42,591 --> 01:13:45,719
- That's what you wanna do to me.
- Gag the animal.

450
01:13:46,661 --> 01:13:48,754
Damn you.

451
01:13:51,233 --> 01:13:56,261
May it please the tribunal, l grant this
creature cannot have come from another planet.

452
01:13:56,338 --> 01:14:00,832
But this much is certain. He does come
from somewhere in the forbidden zone.

453
01:14:00,942 --> 01:14:05,242
He's described the region to us and
described it accurately for l have been there.

454
01:14:05,313 --> 01:14:08,805
- You visited the forbidden zone?
- Yes, sir.

455
01:14:08,917 --> 01:14:11,750
A year ago. With the
permission of the Academy.

456
01:14:11,820 --> 01:14:16,120
He exceeded his orders. His travel
permit was canceled immediately.

457
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:18,022
Yes, sir. That is true, thanks to you.

458
01:14:18,126 --> 01:14:21,584
But not before l discovered evidence

459
01:14:21,663 --> 01:14:25,497
of a simian culture that existed long
before the sacred scrolls were written.

460
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:29,366
Objection. These remarks
are profane and irrelevant.

461
01:14:29,471 --> 01:14:35,205
Sustained. Your archaeological theories have
no bearing on the disposition of this creature.

462
01:14:35,310 --> 01:14:38,837
Let them talk, Mr
President. Let them talk.

463
01:14:38,947 --> 01:14:43,509
Sirs, our theories have
a bearing on his identity.

464
01:14:43,618 --> 01:14:45,051
How so?

465
01:14:45,153 --> 01:14:51,820
Let us assume, as common sense dictates,
that the prisoner's story is false.

466
01:14:51,893 --> 01:14:58,128
But if he did not come from another
planet, then surely he sprang from our own.

467
01:14:59,901 --> 01:15:03,064
Yes. Sprang. As an animal psychologist,

468
01:15:03,171 --> 01:15:08,234
l have found no physiological defect
to explain why humans are mute.

469
01:15:08,343 --> 01:15:10,470
- Objection.
- Sustained.

470
01:15:10,545 --> 01:15:15,744
Their speech organs are adequate. The
flaw lies not in anatomy, but in the brain.

471
01:15:15,850 --> 01:15:17,681
- Objection.
- Sustained.

472
01:15:17,752 --> 01:15:21,347
Sustain all objections,
but face the truth.

473
01:15:21,423 --> 01:15:26,087
Yes. Behold this marvel.
This living paradox.

474
01:15:26,194 --> 01:15:30,722
- This missing link in an evolutionary chain.
- Silence there!

475
01:15:30,832 --> 01:15:34,495
- You go too far.
- l think an indictment is in order.

476
01:15:34,569 --> 01:15:39,700
Yes, sir. The state charges Drs Zira and
Cornelius with contempt of this tribunal,

477
01:15:39,774 --> 01:15:42,368
malicious mischief,
and scientific heresy.

478
01:15:42,444 --> 01:15:49,282
lt is so ordered. This tribunal will examine the
evidence and in due course render its verdict.

479
01:15:49,384 --> 01:15:55,789
As to the proposed indictment and as to
the disposition of the deviate in question,

480
01:15:56,691 --> 01:15:58,852
this hearing is adjourned.

481
01:16:45,674 --> 01:16:47,767
Wait outside.

482
01:16:58,586 --> 01:17:00,645
Well, the verdict is in.

483
01:17:02,257 --> 01:17:07,752
At the moment, your two simian
friends and sponsors are free on bail.

484
01:17:07,829 --> 01:17:11,925
But they'll soon be
brought to trial for heresy.

485
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:16,027
- What about me? - Oh-ho.
Your case was preordained.

486
01:17:17,105 --> 01:17:19,699
ln a way, you did the state a service

487
01:17:19,808 --> 01:17:24,939
because you made it possible for
us to expose Zira and Cornelius.

488
01:17:25,013 --> 01:17:31,043
Now the tribunal has placed you in
my custody for final disposition.

489
01:17:32,387 --> 01:17:35,618
Do you realize what that means?

490
01:17:35,690 --> 01:17:36,679
No.

491
01:17:36,791 --> 01:17:39,624
Emasculation to begin with.

492
01:17:39,694 --> 01:17:44,222
Then experimental surgery on
the speech centers, on the brain.

493
01:17:44,332 --> 01:17:47,324
Eventually a kind of living death.

494
01:17:50,038 --> 01:17:52,131
However,

495
01:17:53,541 --> 01:17:56,999
l have it in my power
to grant a reprieve.

496
01:17:57,078 --> 01:18:01,037
That is why l summoned you here tonight.

497
01:18:01,149 --> 01:18:05,643
Tell me who and what you really
are and where you came from,

498
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:07,847
and no veterinary shall touch you.

499
01:18:07,922 --> 01:18:12,552
- l told you that at that hearing of yours.
- You lied.

500
01:18:12,660 --> 01:18:16,892
- Where is your tribe?
- My tribe.

501
01:18:16,998 --> 01:18:20,161
They live on another planet
in another solar system.

502
01:18:20,235 --> 01:18:24,262
Even in your lies, some
truth slips through.

503
01:18:24,372 --> 01:18:28,399
That mythical community you're
supposed to come from, Fort Wayne.

504
01:18:28,510 --> 01:18:31,707
- What about it?
- A fort.

505
01:18:31,780 --> 01:18:35,216
Unconsciously you chose a
name that was belligerent.

506
01:18:35,283 --> 01:18:37,945
Where were you nurtured?

507
01:18:38,052 --> 01:18:45,117
Then you don't believe that prosecutor's
charge that l'm a monster created by Dr Zira?

508
01:18:45,226 --> 01:18:47,421
Certainly not.

509
01:18:50,198 --> 01:18:54,225
- You're a mutant.
- That's what Zira and Cornelius claim.

510
01:18:54,302 --> 01:18:57,567
- You're talking heresy, doctor.
- Of course.

511
01:18:57,639 --> 01:18:59,698
Suppose l am a mutant.

512
01:18:59,774 --> 01:19:05,212
- How can one mutant send you into a panic?
- Because you're not unique.

513
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:08,647
- There's the one you call Landon.
- Then you admit that...

514
01:19:08,750 --> 01:19:12,811
l admit that where there's one mutant,
there's probably another and another.

515
01:19:12,921 --> 01:19:15,788
A whole nest of them.

516
01:19:15,890 --> 01:19:20,259
Where is your nest, Taylor?
Where are your women?

517
01:19:20,328 --> 01:19:24,594
Thank you. Thank you
for calling me Taylor.

518
01:19:24,666 --> 01:19:28,932
Dr Zaius, l know who l am.

519
01:19:29,003 --> 01:19:36,307
But who are you? How in hell did this
upside-down civilization get started?

520
01:19:36,411 --> 01:19:44,113
You may well call it upside down, since you
occupy its lowest level. And deservedly so.

521
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:49,149
Our eastern desert
has never been explored

522
01:19:49,257 --> 01:19:53,660
because we've always assumed
that life cannot exist there.

523
01:19:53,761 --> 01:20:01,867
Taylor, save yourself. Tell me, is there
anotherjungle beyond the forbidden zone?

524
01:20:01,970 --> 01:20:04,200
l don't know.

525
01:20:04,305 --> 01:20:09,174
lf you're trying to protect others of
your kind, it'll cost you your identity.

526
01:20:09,277 --> 01:20:15,341
l'm not protecting anyone. This whole
thing is insane. What have l done?

527
01:20:20,288 --> 01:20:24,725
You are a menace. A walking pestilence.

528
01:20:25,527 --> 01:20:27,722
l do know who you are, Taylor.

529
01:20:29,998 --> 01:20:33,798
l'll give you just six hours
to make a full confession.

530
01:20:33,868 --> 01:20:36,803
After that l shall use
surgery to obtain one.

531
01:20:36,871 --> 01:20:37,895
Guards!

532
01:20:38,006 --> 01:20:41,237
All right. You can cut pieces
out of me. You've got the power.

533
01:20:41,342 --> 01:20:43,640
Return this creature to his cage.

534
01:20:43,711 --> 01:20:45,736
But you do it out of fear.

535
01:20:45,847 --> 01:20:52,082
Remember that. Because you're afraid
of me. What are you afraid of, doctor?

536
01:21:13,408 --> 01:21:15,740
- Are you Julius?
- Who are you?

537
01:21:15,843 --> 01:21:18,903
l'm from the office of animal affairs.

538
01:21:21,583 --> 01:21:27,715
- That male is to be transferred to the zoo.
- At this hour? Who says so?

539
01:21:27,789 --> 01:21:34,024
Don't they tell you anything? The
antivivisectionist society is up in arms.

540
01:21:34,095 --> 01:21:38,930
They're gonna save this beast
from those butchers in the lab.

541
01:21:39,033 --> 01:21:41,365
lf he can speak, he belongs in a zoo,

542
01:21:41,436 --> 01:21:46,396
but what'll happen is some grown-up'll put
him in a circus and we'll have to pay...

543
01:21:46,474 --> 01:21:50,638
Stop making speeches
and show me the order.

544
01:22:06,494 --> 01:22:11,625
This order's no good. lt must
be countersigned by Dr Zaius.

545
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:13,658
Grab him.

546
01:22:19,907 --> 01:22:22,637
- Who are you?
- So you can talk.

547
01:22:22,744 --> 01:22:26,771
l'm Dr Zira's nephew. This
abduction was her idea.

548
01:22:26,848 --> 01:22:30,807
You're not going to the zoo. That's
our story if somebody stops us.

549
01:22:30,918 --> 01:22:33,250
Get me out of this.

550
01:22:35,323 --> 01:22:37,416
We've gotta move fast.

551
01:22:40,461 --> 01:22:43,658
- She comes too.
- Zira doesn't want your female.

552
01:22:43,765 --> 01:22:46,290
l want her.

553
01:22:46,367 --> 01:22:51,202
lf you insist, but l'm not taking any
orders. All right. Come on. Let's go.

554
01:23:14,128 --> 01:23:18,155
- l told you not to bring the other one.
- He wouldn't leave her.

555
01:23:18,232 --> 01:23:20,325
All right. Come on.

556
01:23:28,142 --> 01:23:30,906
- Put this on.
- Don't you have any clothes for me?

557
01:23:31,012 --> 01:23:34,641
What do you expect? An ape's new suit?

558
01:23:34,716 --> 01:23:38,015
- This stuff stinks.
- So do you. Like all men.

559
01:23:38,086 --> 01:23:42,420
Taylor, remember, all men
look alike to most apes.

560
01:23:42,523 --> 01:23:47,927
So put it on and keep quiet, and we
may just get away with this. Hurry.

561
01:24:37,812 --> 01:24:39,939
Cornelius.

562
01:24:48,623 --> 01:24:50,921
- How'd it go?
- Hey.

563
01:24:52,393 --> 01:24:55,294
Come on. Let me out of this.

564
01:25:04,672 --> 01:25:10,110
- Well, Taylor, we're all fugitives now.
- Do you have any weapons? Any guns?

565
01:25:10,178 --> 01:25:16,310
- The best. But we won't need them.
- l'm glad to hear it. l want one anyway.

566
01:25:24,025 --> 01:25:26,294
l'm in charge of this expedition.

567
01:25:26,294 --> 01:25:36,031
Good for you. But you're not in charge of me. Not any
more. - l don't plan to be caught again. - As you wish.

568
01:25:36,137 --> 01:25:40,471
Dr Zaius thinks there's anotherjungle
beyond the forbidden zone.

569
01:25:40,541 --> 01:25:43,169
l'll try for that. What about you?

570
01:25:43,277 --> 01:25:45,973
Cornelius and l have
been indicted for heresy.

571
01:25:46,047 --> 01:25:49,676
Unless we can prove our theories,
we don't stand a chance of acquittal.

572
01:25:49,784 --> 01:25:54,988
You're going back to the forbidden zone?
Back to the diggings l worked at a year ago.

573
01:25:55,056 --> 01:25:57,889
lt's a three-day ride
across the desert.

574
01:25:57,992 --> 01:26:01,018
Near where you claim you
landed from that planet.

575
01:26:01,128 --> 01:26:04,461
- Still don't believe me?
- lt's a long detour to Dead Lake.

576
01:26:04,532 --> 01:26:06,966
- What would we find?
- Nothing much.

577
01:26:07,034 --> 01:26:14,031
An empty rubber life raft. Maybe a
little flag, the emblem of my countrymen.

578
01:26:14,141 --> 01:26:20,637
The terrain around that lake is poisonous.
There's no fresh water, no vegetation.

579
01:26:24,752 --> 01:26:29,382
l ought to thank you for saving
me. You'll be in trouble for that.

580
01:26:29,490 --> 01:26:34,018
We've been in trouble
since the moment we met you.

581
01:26:36,664 --> 01:26:41,897
- What's she pointing at?
- Must be close to home for her. She knows it.

582
01:26:45,406 --> 01:26:47,670
Nova, no. Nova...

583
01:26:47,742 --> 01:26:51,178
Nova, you can't go there.
lt's not safe. Nova.

584
01:26:55,249 --> 01:27:00,118
We'd better get started. lf the mounted police
pick up our trail, they'll come this far.

585
01:27:00,221 --> 01:27:04,055
Let's get the water and
provisions into the wagon.

586
01:28:16,364 --> 01:28:18,457
Cornelius.

587
01:28:21,202 --> 01:28:23,295
Where does this river lead to?

588
01:28:23,371 --> 01:28:27,967
lt flows into a sea some miles from here.
That's where we'll find the diggings.

589
01:28:28,042 --> 01:28:31,205
- And beyond that?
- l don't know.

590
01:28:31,312 --> 01:28:37,308
You can't ride along the shore at high tide
and we had no boats on our last expedition.

591
01:28:37,385 --> 01:28:41,549
You never told me
- why do you call this the forbidden zone?

592
01:28:41,655 --> 01:28:47,287
No one knows. lt's an ancient taboo,
set forth in the sacred scrolls.

593
01:28:47,361 --> 01:28:51,559
The lawgiver pronounced
this whole area deadly.

594
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:57,294
- Shouldn't we be moving on?
- l'm for that.

595
01:30:26,627 --> 01:30:28,720
Do you like it?

596
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:35,994
Why did you do that?
Scrape off your hair?

597
01:30:36,103 --> 01:30:40,631
ln my world, when l left it,
only kids your age wore beards.

598
01:30:40,741 --> 01:30:44,404
Beards? l don't go in for fads.

599
01:30:45,279 --> 01:30:49,807
Somehow it makes you
look less intelligent.

600
01:30:51,785 --> 01:30:57,018
- When will you show me what's in that cave?
- Right now, if you like.

601
01:31:15,442 --> 01:31:16,466
Cornelius.

602
01:31:27,821 --> 01:31:30,722
- Lucius, don't fire.
- You're under arrest.

603
01:31:34,995 --> 01:31:40,900
lf there's any more shooting, Dr Zaius,
you'll be the first to go. You can count on it.

604
01:31:41,001 --> 01:31:44,402
- You are not in command. Put down that gun.
- Shut up.

605
01:31:44,505 --> 01:31:47,804
Very well. Lower your weapons.

606
01:31:47,875 --> 01:31:51,538
Tell them to pull back around
the rocks, out of range.

607
01:31:52,546 --> 01:31:54,639
Withdraw.

608
01:32:00,387 --> 01:32:02,821
How did you know we'd come here?

609
01:32:02,890 --> 01:32:06,257
Only an apostate would
flee to the forbidden zone.

610
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:10,387
And only a fool would
give a gun to an animal.

611
01:32:10,497 --> 01:32:13,398
l see you've brought the
female of your species.

612
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:17,493
l didn't realize that
man could be monogamous.

613
01:32:17,571 --> 01:32:20,267
On this planet it's easy.

614
01:32:21,508 --> 01:32:25,035
l ask you to reconsider the
rash course you've undertaken.

615
01:32:25,112 --> 01:32:29,412
lf you're convicted of heresy,
the most you'll get is two years.

616
01:32:29,516 --> 01:32:36,012
But, if you persist in pointing guns in
my direction, you'll hang for high treason.

617
01:32:36,090 --> 01:32:42,427
We never meant to be treasonous, sir. But,
up in that cliff, there is a vast cave.

618
01:32:42,529 --> 01:32:46,465
And in that cave a fabulous
treasure of fossils and artifacts.

619
01:32:46,567 --> 01:32:50,025
l've seen some of your fossils
and artifacts. Worthless.

620
01:32:50,104 --> 01:32:52,072
There's your minister of science.

621
01:32:52,139 --> 01:32:55,404
Honor-bound to expand the
frontiers of knowledge.

622
01:32:55,476 --> 01:32:58,639
- Please!
- Except he's also chief defender of the faith.

623
01:32:58,746 --> 01:33:03,809
There is no contradiction between faith and science
- true science.

624
01:33:03,917 --> 01:33:07,080
- Are you willing to put it to the test?
- l'd rather...

625
01:33:07,154 --> 01:33:12,251
Take it easy. You saved me from this
fanatic. Maybe l can return the favor.

626
01:33:12,326 --> 01:33:14,760
What is your proposal?

627
01:33:14,828 --> 01:33:19,390
- When were those sacred scrolls written?
- 1,200 years ago.

628
01:33:19,466 --> 01:33:24,267
All right. lf they can prove those scrolls
don't tell the whole truth of your history,

629
01:33:24,338 --> 01:33:31,403
if they can find some real evidence of another
culture from the past, will you let them off?

630
01:33:31,478 --> 01:33:34,914
- Of course.
- Let's go up to the cave.

631
01:33:39,586 --> 01:33:42,487
Sorry. You stay here and guard the camp.

632
01:33:42,589 --> 01:33:45,922
Always giving orders. Just
like every other adult.

633
01:33:45,993 --> 01:33:49,156
Relax. You'll get to
see it all later on.

634
01:34:51,024 --> 01:34:53,390
Present your evidence, Cornelius.

635
01:34:53,494 --> 01:34:58,488
lt was at this level that l discovered
traces of an early ape creature.

636
01:34:58,565 --> 01:35:04,299
A stage of primitive barbarism really,
dating back some 1,300 years roughly.

637
01:35:04,371 --> 01:35:09,968
lt was at this level l discovered
cutting tools and arrowheads of quartz

638
01:35:10,043 --> 01:35:14,173
and the fossilized bones
of carnivorous gorillas.

639
01:35:14,348 --> 01:35:18,842
But the artifacts lying here

640
01:35:20,220 --> 01:35:22,882
were found at this level,

641
01:35:23,824 --> 01:35:26,315
and date back 700 years earlier.

642
01:35:26,894 --> 01:35:32,196
That's the paradox. For the more
ancient culture is the more advanced.

643
01:35:32,266 --> 01:35:35,895
Now, admittedly, many of
these objects are unidentified.

644
01:35:36,003 --> 01:35:40,770
But clearly they were fashioned by
beings with a knowledge of metallurgy.

645
01:35:40,874 --> 01:35:44,742
lndeed, the fact that many of
these tools are unknown to us

646
01:35:44,878 --> 01:35:49,406
suggests a culture which, in
certain ways, equals our own.

647
01:35:49,516 --> 01:35:51,780
Some of the evidence is uncontestable.

648
01:35:51,885 --> 01:35:57,187
Don't speak to me in absolutes.
The evidence is contestable.

649
01:35:57,257 --> 01:35:58,918
l apologize, sir.

650
01:35:59,026 --> 01:36:03,190
To begin with, your methods of dating
the past are crude to say the least.

651
01:36:03,263 --> 01:36:06,926
There are geologists on my staff
who'd laugh at your speculations.

652
01:36:07,034 --> 01:36:10,470
- But there's the doll, sir.
- What?

653
01:36:12,206 --> 01:36:15,369
Lying right there. The human doll.

654
01:36:20,781 --> 01:36:26,481
What does this prove? My
granddaughter plays with human dolls.

655
01:36:26,587 --> 01:36:29,715
The doll was found beside
the jawbone of a man

656
01:36:29,790 --> 01:36:33,226
and no trace of simian fossil
has been found in this deposit.

657
01:36:33,293 --> 01:36:39,391
Your conclusion is premature. Have you
forgotten your scripture? The 13th scroll?

658
01:36:39,466 --> 01:36:42,162
''Proteus brought the
upright beast into the garden

659
01:36:42,269 --> 01:36:46,069
and chained him to a tree and the
children did make sport of it.''

660
01:36:46,139 --> 01:36:48,334
No, sir, l have not forgotten.

661
01:36:48,442 --> 01:36:52,970
For a time the ancients
kept humans as household pets

662
01:36:53,080 --> 01:36:57,847
until our lawgiver proved
that man could not be tamed.

663
01:36:57,985 --> 01:37:03,013
Keep digging, Cornelius. You'll find
evidence of the master of this house...

664
01:37:04,324 --> 01:37:06,758
An ape.

665
01:37:09,530 --> 01:37:13,864
- What are you doing?
- Reconstructing a past life.

666
01:37:16,136 --> 01:37:20,095
These things were found at
the same level as that doll?

667
01:37:20,173 --> 01:37:25,668
Whoever owned them must have been in
pretty bad shape. He wore false teeth.

668
01:37:25,779 --> 01:37:27,838
And eyeglasses.

669
01:37:28,348 --> 01:37:30,816
He had a failing heart.

670
01:37:31,818 --> 01:37:37,654
Towards the end, he had this
prefabricated valve put in it.

671
01:37:38,458 --> 01:37:43,623
l don't say he was a man like l knew at
home, but he must have been a close relative.

672
01:37:43,697 --> 01:37:49,226
He had all the same weaknesses.
He was a weak, fragile animal.

673
01:37:50,871 --> 01:37:54,568
But he was here before you
and he was better than you are.

674
01:37:54,675 --> 01:38:00,739
That's lunacy. l can offer alternate
descriptions of every one of those articles

675
01:38:00,847 --> 01:38:03,816
which is just as ingenious as yours.

676
01:38:03,884 --> 01:38:06,512
But it'd be conjecture, not proof.

677
01:38:06,587 --> 01:38:08,521
Mamma.

678
01:38:15,495 --> 01:38:17,554
Mamma.

679
01:38:20,067 --> 01:38:25,665
Dr Zaius, would an ape make
a human doll that talks?

680
01:38:30,377 --> 01:38:31,503
Lucius.

681
01:38:34,681 --> 01:38:36,444
You dirty...

682
01:38:36,550 --> 01:38:37,574
Nova.

683
01:38:58,105 --> 01:38:59,129
Nova.

684
01:39:37,110 --> 01:39:38,941
Cornelius.

685
01:39:39,012 --> 01:39:40,639
Zira.

686
01:39:40,747 --> 01:39:43,079
Help me.

687
01:39:44,918 --> 01:39:46,977
Mamma.

688
01:39:53,694 --> 01:39:57,130
l oughta kill you right now. Come on.

689
01:39:58,799 --> 01:40:03,702
- Tell 'em to pull back. Now.
- Cease fire. Withdraw.

690
01:40:05,672 --> 01:40:09,130
- Up there.
- Withdraw.

691
01:40:11,311 --> 01:40:13,370
Get down.

692
01:40:26,827 --> 01:40:31,457
- Lucius, are you all right?
- They took me by surprise.

693
01:40:31,531 --> 01:40:35,023
Sneaked up on me while
l was feeding the horses.

694
01:40:35,135 --> 01:40:41,005
What's happened to honor? l
got off two rounds to warn you.

695
01:40:41,074 --> 01:40:45,204
- They've taken everything.
- Not quite everything.

696
01:40:45,312 --> 01:40:48,008
They left a hostage behind.

697
01:40:48,081 --> 01:40:50,481
- How are you feeling?
- Disillusioned.

698
01:40:50,550 --> 01:40:55,010
- You can't trust the older generation.
- l know what you mean.

699
01:40:55,088 --> 01:41:00,185
l want you to go and tell those
gorillas l've got Dr Zaius prisoner.

700
01:41:00,260 --> 01:41:01,557
Yes, l can do that.

701
01:41:01,661 --> 01:41:06,155
l want a horse, food, water. Enough
for a week for me and this female.

702
01:41:06,233 --> 01:41:08,565
And 50 rounds of ammunition.

703
01:41:08,668 --> 01:41:12,263
- What if they won't agree to your terms?
- Tell them l'll shoot him.

704
01:41:12,372 --> 01:41:16,001
- Taylor, you can't.
- Oh, yes, he can.

705
01:41:17,544 --> 01:41:21,878
He's a born killer. Deliver the message.

706
01:41:23,583 --> 01:41:25,676
Over here.

707
01:41:29,556 --> 01:41:31,046
Sit down.

708
01:41:46,907 --> 01:41:47,931
Taylor...

709
01:41:48,041 --> 01:41:51,442
Please, don't treat him like that.

710
01:41:51,545 --> 01:41:54,639
- Why not?
- lt's humiliating.

711
01:41:55,549 --> 01:42:00,953
The way l was humiliated by all of
you? You led me around on a leash.

712
01:42:01,054 --> 01:42:03,887
That was different. We
thought you were inferior.

713
01:42:03,957 --> 01:42:06,585
Now you know better.

714
01:42:06,660 --> 01:42:11,097
Cornelius was right, doctor. He
proved it. Man was here first.

715
01:42:11,164 --> 01:42:15,294
You owe him your science, culture,
whatever civilization you've got.

716
01:42:15,402 --> 01:42:20,806
Then answer me this. lf man was
superior, why didn't he survive?

717
01:42:20,907 --> 01:42:25,776
Wiped out by a plague, some natural
catastrophe, a storm of meteors.

718
01:42:25,846 --> 01:42:28,644
From the looks of this
planet, that's a fair bet.

719
01:42:28,748 --> 01:42:32,616
- But we can't be sure.
- He is.

720
01:42:32,686 --> 01:42:37,282
He knew all the time. Long before
you found your cave, he knew.

721
01:42:37,357 --> 01:42:42,021
Defender of the faith? Guardian of the
terrible secret. That's it, isn't it, doctor?

722
01:42:42,128 --> 01:42:45,359
What l know of man was written long ago.

723
01:42:45,465 --> 01:42:49,265
Set down by the greatest
ape of all, our lawgiver.

724
01:42:49,336 --> 01:42:50,325
Cornelius...

725
01:42:50,437 --> 01:42:52,428
Come here.

726
01:42:52,505 --> 01:42:58,876
Reach into my pocket. Read to
him the 29th scroll, 6th verse.

727
01:43:02,849 --> 01:43:07,377
''Beware the beast man, for
he is the devil's pawn.''

728
01:43:07,487 --> 01:43:14,120
''Alone among God's primates, he
kills for sport or lust or greed.''

729
01:43:15,061 --> 01:43:19,828
''Yea, he will murder his brother
to possess his brother's land.''

730
01:43:19,900 --> 01:43:26,464
''Let him not breed in great numbers, for he
will make a desert of his home and yours.''

731
01:43:26,539 --> 01:43:31,533
''Shun him. Drive him back
into his jungle lair.''

732
01:43:31,645 --> 01:43:34,671
''For he is the harbinger of death.''

733
01:43:36,650 --> 01:43:40,017
l found nothing in the cave
to alter that conception of man

734
01:43:40,086 --> 01:43:42,213
and l still live by its injunction.

735
01:43:51,898 --> 01:43:54,594
That's far enough.

736
01:44:00,507 --> 01:44:03,943
They think you're behaving foolishly.

737
01:44:04,044 --> 01:44:08,174
l must say, l agree. Where will you go?

738
01:44:08,248 --> 01:44:11,843
To start with, l'll follow
the shoreline and my nose.

739
01:44:11,918 --> 01:44:16,787
Suppose you find nothing but
wasteland? How will you survive?

740
01:44:16,890 --> 01:44:19,552
He won't survive.

741
01:44:23,730 --> 01:44:25,789
Nova.

742
01:44:28,635 --> 01:44:31,798
- How about coming along?
- We can't.

743
01:44:31,905 --> 01:44:34,373
Better than going to jail for heresy.

744
01:44:34,441 --> 01:44:38,400
They can't convict us of heresy.
You've helped prove our innocence.

745
01:44:38,478 --> 01:44:40,309
Besides...

746
01:44:40,413 --> 01:44:43,439
his culture is our culture.

747
01:44:43,550 --> 01:44:45,450
Well...

748
01:44:45,552 --> 01:44:47,611
Good luck, then.

749
01:44:52,792 --> 01:44:54,987
Lucius.

750
01:44:55,095 --> 01:44:59,828
- l still say you're making a mistake.
- That's the spirit. Keep 'em flying.

751
01:44:59,933 --> 01:45:02,731
- What?
- The flags of discontent.

752
01:45:02,802 --> 01:45:05,430
Remember, never trust anybody over 30.

753
01:45:05,505 --> 01:45:09,567
Doctor, l'd like to kiss you goodbye.

754
01:45:16,683 --> 01:45:20,779
All right, but you're so damned ugly!

755
01:45:46,513 --> 01:45:51,849
- Don't follow us. l'm pretty handy with this.
- Of that l'm sure.

756
01:45:51,951 --> 01:45:57,548
All my life l've awaited your coming
and dreaded it, like death itself.

757
01:45:57,657 --> 01:46:02,720
Why? l've terrified you from
the first, doctor. l still do.

758
01:46:02,829 --> 01:46:07,960
- You're afraid of me and you hate me. Why?
- Because you're a man.

759
01:46:08,034 --> 01:46:13,529
And you're right. l have
always known about man.

760
01:46:13,640 --> 01:46:19,909
From the evidence, l believe his wisdom
must walk hand in hand with his idiocy.

761
01:46:20,013 --> 01:46:22,481
His emotions must rule his brain.

762
01:46:22,549 --> 01:46:27,316
He must be a warlike creature who
gives battle to everything around him,

763
01:46:27,387 --> 01:46:28,411
even himself.

764
01:46:28,521 --> 01:46:31,547
What evidence? There were
no weapons in that cave.

765
01:46:31,658 --> 01:46:35,219
The forbidden zone was once a paradise.

766
01:46:35,328 --> 01:46:39,355
Your breed made a desert of it ages ago.

767
01:46:39,432 --> 01:46:41,900
lt still doesn't give me the why.

768
01:46:42,001 --> 01:46:48,167
A planet where apes evolved from
men? There's gotta be an answer.

769
01:46:48,241 --> 01:46:53,406
Don't look for it, Taylor.
You may not like what you find.

770
01:47:02,021 --> 01:47:04,080
Untie me.

771
01:47:17,804 --> 01:47:18,862
No, no, no.

772
01:47:18,938 --> 01:47:21,031
Wait. Wait.

773
01:47:21,975 --> 01:47:24,239
Let him go.

774
01:47:25,645 --> 01:47:30,082
Lieutenant, fetch your explosives.
We're going to seal up the cave.

775
01:47:30,150 --> 01:47:31,549
Yes, sir.

776
01:47:31,618 --> 01:47:33,415
- Seal the cave?
- That is correct.

777
01:47:33,486 --> 01:47:37,752
- And you will both stand trial for heresy.
- But the proof. The doll.

778
01:47:37,824 --> 01:47:43,490
ln a few minutes there will be no
doll. There can't be. l'm sorry.

779
01:47:43,596 --> 01:47:45,063
Dr Zaius...

780
01:47:45,131 --> 01:47:48,589
- You mustn't. You promised.
- What l do, l do with no pleasure.

781
01:47:48,668 --> 01:47:51,262
- Silence him.
- Doctor.

782
01:47:51,337 --> 01:47:57,403
Dr Zaius, this is inexcusable.
Why must knowledge stand still?

783
01:47:57,477 --> 01:48:00,674
What about the future?

784
01:48:00,780 --> 01:48:03,749
l may just have saved it for you.

785
01:48:06,019 --> 01:48:09,614
What will he find out there, doctor?

786
01:48:09,689 --> 01:48:11,816
His destiny.

787
01:50:22,422 --> 01:50:24,253
Oh, my God.

788
01:50:25,391 --> 01:50:27,450
l'm back.

789
01:50:28,628 --> 01:50:30,960
l'm home.

790
01:50:31,064 --> 01:50:33,123
All the time, it was...

791
01:50:35,468 --> 01:50:38,335
We finally really did it.

792
01:50:38,438 --> 01:50:40,963
You maniacs!

793
01:50:42,108 --> 01:50:44,474
You blew it up!

794
01:50:44,577 --> 01:50:46,636
God damn you!

795
01:50:47,647 --> 01:50:52,243
God damn you all to hell!
