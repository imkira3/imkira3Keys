When are you going to be ready for us

I thought we got rid of that
crummy little firehouse months ago!

36
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:41,240
There's just one holdup. We couldn't get
old lady Steinmetz to sign the papers.

Come on, boys. I expect a little action,
and I better get it or else!

For some reason,

Of course she doesn't.

of my sister's from back east?

He was going to
law school or something?

Oh, well, well.
Humanitarian of the Year, eh?

65
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:14,166
That's right, Uncle.

66
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:19,296
Award committees give out humanitarian
awards to a lot of strange ducks,

67
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,464
but why me?

68
00:06:20,506 --> 00:06:21,799
I was the award committee.

00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:23,967
You put in the fix!

00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:26,178

of your Uncle Alonzo.

You're a smart boy!

00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:29,223
If there's one thing I admire,

73
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:32,309
it's somebody who knows
how to use juice properly.

00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:33,477
Juice?

75
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:36,188
Yes, juice. How to
use muscle, influence,

76
00:06:36,355 --> 00:06:38,565
how to bend things his own way.

77
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:40,901
Oh, no. My goodness, no.

78
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:43,320
It wasn't done dishonestly.
I thought it over,

79
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:48,283
and I couldn't think of anyone
any more deserving than you.

80
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:49,993
How come?

81
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,663
From the day I was born,
my mother never tired of telling me

82
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:55,082
what a great man her brother was,

83
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:58,836
getting rid of dirty old buildings
and building shiny new ones,

84
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:02,005
sending us California fruit at Christmas.
You were her idol.

You clowns get out of here.

88
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:17,312
and see the shining light
of idealism aglow there,

89
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:21,692
it makes me young again
and ready for battle.

90
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:22,776
Battle?

91
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,153
Yes, battle!

92
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:27,197
It has never been easy for us idealists.

93
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:31,660
Now, I'm going to give you
a chance to put that idealism into play

94
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:33,662
on your very first job.

95
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:35,414
Oh.

96
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:40,043
Picture if you will, a tough, little old lady,

97
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:43,922
living in a rundown,
rat-infested firehouse,

98
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:47,509
standing right in the way
of our latest civic benefaction.

99
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:52,347
There may be city builders
who might find it in their heart

100
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:54,349
to be vindictive to this old lady.

101
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:56,643
They might say that

102
00:07:56,727 --> 00:08:01,064
she feeds on the misery of the poor
in that forsaken neighborhood,

103
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:06,445
that she rolls drunks,
that she teaches small children to steal

104
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:10,407
and make them bring
most of the take to her.

105
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:15,204
Would I, Alonzo Hawk,
Humanitarian of the Year,

106
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,414
stoop to such tactics?

107
00:08:17,498 --> 00:08:19,333
On the contrary!

108
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:21,752
I would do everything in my power

109
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:25,422
to help that tough,
no-good, little old lady.

110
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:28,425
I would give her a large sum
for that worthless property,

111
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,762
and I would provide
a special price to her alone

112
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:35,265
a lifetime lease in Eternity Towers,

113
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:38,894
that beautiful new haven
for helpless old people such as herself.

114
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:41,730
It has a gymnasium, a sauna,

115
00:08:41,772 --> 00:08:45,609
an old Rudolph Valentino-
Sessue Hayakawa movie.

116
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:48,195
It has a beauty parlor, hobby center,

117
00:08:48,946 --> 00:08:52,115
and instead of
cooking her heart out over a hot stove,

118
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:55,285
there would be
automatic machines in every hall

119
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:58,872
to lavish her with everything
from pizza to hot chili.

120
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:04,628
Now wouldn't it make just your
whole being happy to be part of all that?

121
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:05,963
When can I start, Uncle?

122
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:07,506
Here's the address. Get moving.

123
00:09:31,822 --> 00:09:33,991
- Here.
- Thanks, pal.

124
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:35,742
Ah, isn't it breathtaking?

Mrs. Steinmetz? Good morning.
My name is Willoughby Whitfield.

131
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:59,057
I'd like to discuss business with you.

132
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:00,142
Come in, won't you?

133
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:01,268
I can't.

134
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:04,396
You see this car has rolled onto my foot.

135
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:06,273
Oh, dear!

136
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:09,026
I guess somebody forgot
to set the brake or something.

137
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:10,569
Herbie, aren't you ashamed of yourself?

138
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:13,030
Get off of Mr. Whitfield's foot.

139
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:15,032
Herbie's always trying to protect me.

140
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:16,158
Herbie?

141
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:19,369
I'm quite capable of
taking care of myself.

142
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:21,747
I was about to make a nice cup of tea.

143
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,041
Come in. You must have one with me.

144
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:25,083
Oh, thank you.

145
00:10:26,877 --> 00:10:29,171
Of course, I have to humor Herbie.

146
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:31,757
He used to be a famous racing car,

147
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,593
but his driver went to Europe
to drive foreign cars,

148
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:37,471
so he's a little sensitive.
You can understand that.

149
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:40,307
Yes. Now, to get down
to business, Mrs. Steinmetz.

150
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:43,060
People have been worrying
about you living in this old firetrap.

151
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:44,811
I've been asked to come over and...

152
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:47,564
Firehouse, not firetrap.

153
00:10:47,606 --> 00:10:50,233
Firehouse, yes. Be that as it may,

154
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:51,693
the least we can do...

- No.
- He's a friend of Herbie's, of course.

160
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:09,336
Friend of Herbie's?

161
00:11:09,628 --> 00:11:11,380
So is old 22.

162
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:15,967
You may as well meet
all the family while you're here.

163
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:19,096
Number 22 used to be
on the old Clay Street line.

164
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:21,932
(BELL CLANGING)

165
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:23,934
Herbie found him in a vacant lot.

166
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:26,103
Someone had used him
as a chicken house.

167
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:28,105
He's much happier here, of course.

168
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:32,275
I can understand that you may have

169
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:34,444
some emotional attachment
to this old building...

170
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:36,279
Indeed, I have.

171
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:39,574
I was married here to my late husband,

172
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:42,452
Captain Steinmetz,
of the San Francisco Fire Department.

173
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:45,205
- Oh?
- One of the heroes of the great fire.

174
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:49,459
We understand your position.
That's why Mr. Hawk has authorized...

175
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:51,294
Don't tell me you're from Alonzo Hawk?

176
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:52,421
Yes.

177
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:53,630
Oh, you have such a nice face.

178
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:54,715
Thank you.

179
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:58,343
Not at all like those ruffians
he usually sends.

180
00:11:58,427 --> 00:12:02,472
If you would just look
at the size of this check.

181
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:05,225
I don't know anything about money.

182
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:08,895
My nephew, Tennessee Steinmetz,
usually takes care of me.

183
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:10,397
He used to live here.

184
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,984
He had to rush off to Tibet
because his guru got sick.

185
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:17,237
If you would just look at this...
What's a guru?

186
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:21,616
His teacher! My nephew is
a student of Oriental Philosophy.

187
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:25,120
That's how he learned
that things have an inner life.

188
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:29,666
Like wind, rain, traffic lights,
can openers, flowers...

189
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,668
And little cars.

190
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:34,796
That's how Herbie and Tennessee
became such great friends.

191
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:38,800
Mrs. Steinmetz, this sum of money could
take care of you for the rest of your life.

192
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:42,637
I didn't have to study Oriental
Philosophy the way Tennessee did.

193
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,347
I could talk to Herbie right off.

194
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:45,390
Oh?

195
00:12:45,474 --> 00:12:46,850
I guess it's in the blood.

196
00:12:50,312 --> 00:12:51,980

I have an agreement here.

201
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:05,410
I want you to meet a gentleman
from Mr. Hawk's.

202
00:13:05,494 --> 00:13:07,788

Such a nice young man.

00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:16,546
They're bothering us again?

206
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:18,048
You've hurt your hand.

On the contrary, it feels marvelous.

208

Are you all right, Mr. Whitfield?

209
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:26,473
What was that?

210
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:30,811
Nicole Harris, a very brave young lady.
She works for the airline.

211
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:34,940
Last week she knocked out a hijacker
with a bottle of California wine.

212
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:38,068
Now, get out. If you or any more
of Hawk's stooges come around,

00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:39,736
you'll get worse than that.

Miss, you look like a sensible person.

You must know living all alone
in this crummy neighborhood

226
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:25,323
is no place for an elderly woman.

She's got me...

All right, Herbie. Let's get going.

00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:16,416
Miss Harris, you're obviously
an intelligent young woman.

00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:19,753
Why do you pretend to talk to this car?

Don't listen to him, Herbie. Just move it.

243

I can understand Mrs. Steinmetz
thinking of this car as a person.

Herbie's very sensitive
about his appearance.

00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:18,218
Oh, no, I can't stand men who apologize.

318
00:20:18,301 --> 00:20:20,887
Oh, uh, well, may I take you to lunch?

319
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:22,847
All right.

320
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:37,195
I used to live in a little apartment
building opposite the firehouse.

321
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:41,157
I loved it. Then Alonzo Hawk came
along to tear the place down.

322
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:42,408
And kicked me out.

323
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:44,035
I'm sure he didn't mean it personally.

324
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:47,580
Now you know why I go crazy every time
I hear the name Hawk. How's your jaw?

325
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:50,041
It's all right. It's... Ooh.

326
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:54,504
I'm sorry. How was I supposed to know
it was your first assignment?

327
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:56,881
You couldn't possibly know
what a no-good he is.

328
00:20:57,131 --> 00:20:58,174
Miss, there's something
I should tell you...

329
00:20:58,216 --> 00:21:02,178
Anyway, Mrs. Steinmetz took me in
until I could find another place to live.

330
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:07,016
When I found out what Hawk was up to,
I stayed on to protect her.

331
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:10,103
I wasn't gonna let rats from Alonzo Hawk
talk her out of her home.

332
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:11,938
I don't think you're being quite fair.

333
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:13,731
Fair? To Alonzo Hawk?

334
00:21:13,815 --> 00:21:14,816
Yes.

335
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:17,443
Don't tell me he's conned you
the way he's conned everybody else.

336
00:21:17,527 --> 00:21:18,695
I think I should tell you that...

337
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:20,613
Did you know...

338
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:24,117
He put a parking garage on the lot where
the DiMaggios learned to play baseball?

339
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,201
Please, I...

340
00:21:25,243 --> 00:21:27,203
His factories are polluting
all the fish in the Bay.

341
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:28,329
Look,you...

342
00:21:28,371 --> 00:21:30,290
His skyscraper casts
a cold, gray shadow

343
00:21:30,373 --> 00:21:32,500
on the children's playground
all day long.

344
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:33,584
Let me tell you...

345
00:21:33,668 --> 00:21:36,254
He kicked 30 old-time Chinese families

346
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:38,214
off Grand Avenue to make room
for his skyscraper.

348
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:42,844

would do things like that.

356

Yes, dear. I still can't understand

357
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:08,661
why you hit him with a boiled lobster.

358

Grandma, I wish I could stop
doing things like that.

- Oh, shut up!

We'll start on number one, harassment.

And I wrote the book on harassment.

483
00:31:05,948 --> 00:31:08,367
We'll shut off her phone,
turn off her water.

484
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:11,203
We'll sic the health

living in a place like that?

Who looks out for her?
How does she get around?

489
00:31:21,964 --> 00:31:24,466
She has a little car
she goes everywhere in.

as a repossessor of motorcars.

At the tender age of 19,

I was the best-known repossessor
of cars west of the Mississippi.

00:41:26,109 --> 00:41:28,153
One of us has to keep our nerve.

632
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:39,289
Come on, come on! Move it!

633
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:43,668
(CHUCKLING) Now we've got him.

634
00:41:45,378 --> 00:41:46,755
Stop woolgathering, Herbie.

635
00:41:46,796 --> 00:41:49,799
We really must get to the market.

636
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,595
Oh, oh! Wait a minute.

637
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:56,264
Look out! He's coming back!

638
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:58,642
Ooh!

639
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:01,937
Look out! Look out!

640
00:42:17,077 --> 00:42:20,580
Grandma, I was worried about you.
Is everything all right?

641
00:42:20,622 --> 00:42:23,833
Wonderful! Herbie took me
for a nice drive on the bridge.

642
00:42:23,917 --> 00:42:25,377
Let me help you.

643
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:27,837
It's Mr. Whitfield.
So nice to see you again.

644
00:42:28,129 --> 00:42:30,298
This morning you were
on your way to Missouri.

645
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:31,800
Nicole spoke to me.

646
00:42:31,841 --> 00:42:35,387
Grandma, Mr. Whitfield's agreed
to help us fight his uncle.

647
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:38,807
Wonderful! Stay for dinner.

648
00:42:38,848 --> 00:42:40,308
I've already invited him.

649
00:42:40,517 --> 00:42:42,852
Why don't you take those
out to the kitchen?

650
00:42:42,936 --> 00:42:44,145
Yeah. Thank you.

651
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:49,442
What a fine young man!

652
00:42:49,484 --> 00:42:51,236
You look so right together.

653
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:52,487
Oh!

654
00:42:52,571 --> 00:42:54,656
Now, if there's anything I can do...

655
00:42:55,115 --> 00:42:58,243
There is one thing, Grandma.

656
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,580
Just let nature take its course.

657
00:43:01,663 --> 00:43:05,333
Oh, yes, dear.
Oh, I wouldn't want to interfere,

658
00:43:05,417 --> 00:43:06,668
not for anything.

659
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:07,752
Oh.

660
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:10,547
By the way, we're going to want
more broccoli for dinner.

661
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:12,674
Will you and Willoughby
pick me up some, please?

662
00:43:12,757 --> 00:43:13,800
Sure.

663
00:43:13,842 --> 00:43:16,845
Incidentally, you ought to
drive down to the beach.

664
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:17,929
Grandma!

665
00:43:18,013 --> 00:43:19,180
It's the most beautiful day.

666
00:43:19,681 --> 00:43:21,558
We'll just go get some broccoli.

667
00:43:22,601 --> 00:43:24,060
Yes, dear, of course.

668
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:29,482
I'm not gonna say another word, Herbie.

669
00:43:29,524 --> 00:43:31,901
There's nothing I can do.

670
00:43:34,738 --> 00:43:39,451
Of course, I can't help it if you
happen to have a mind of your own.

671
00:43:39,826 --> 00:43:41,328
Can I?

672
00:43:47,334 --> 00:43:50,712
I guess I should have
told Mrs. Steinmetz I don't like broccoli.

673
00:44:02,557 --> 00:44:04,559
Herbie, where are you going?

674
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:12,025
The young lady and gentleman
have turned towards the north.

675
00:44:21,034 --> 00:44:24,913
It would appear that they're not
immediately returning to the firehouse.

676
00:44:25,246 --> 00:44:28,583
See that they don't.
Do anything you have to,

677
00:44:28,625 --> 00:44:32,003
but don't let them return to
that firehouse until after dark.

678
00:44:32,087 --> 00:44:33,129
Do you read me?

679
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:34,714
Perfectly, sir.

680
00:44:38,218 --> 00:44:40,637
Oh, Grandma put him up to this.

681
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:41,721
Where's he taking us?

682
00:44:41,763 --> 00:44:43,890
I don't know, but I could make a guess.

683
00:44:56,611 --> 00:45:00,365
Pardon me, sir.
Is this the only road from the beach?

684
00:45:00,949 --> 00:45:02,325
Yep!

685
00:45:02,409 --> 00:45:05,412
Would you care, sir, to earn $50?

686
00:45:05,453 --> 00:45:06,746
Don't mind.

687
00:45:06,788 --> 00:45:09,999
We wish you to obstruct the road
from the beach for two hours.

688
00:45:10,083 --> 00:45:12,460
My employer is preparing
a surprise party...

689
00:45:12,544 --> 00:45:15,380
Don't explain.
Just give me the money.

690
00:45:17,966 --> 00:45:20,135
It's very romantic here, don't you think?

691
00:45:21,511 --> 00:45:23,638
Do you know that's
the first time I've ever heard

692
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,474
anyone use the word "romantic"
in a real conversation?

693
00:45:26,516 --> 00:45:30,478
I hope I wasn't being too forward,
but it is romantic.

694
00:45:30,979 --> 00:45:34,482
I think that's what Grandma had in mind.

695
00:45:34,524 --> 00:45:38,069
She always thought
the Pacific Ocean was very romantic.

696
00:45:38,153 --> 00:45:39,571
Captain Steinmetz proposed to her

697
00:45:39,654 --> 00:45:42,282
on the beach near
the Cliff House 50 years ago.

698

(HONKING)

700
00:45:47,245 --> 00:45:50,039
I'm sorry I punched you
the first time I met you.

701
00:45:50,123 --> 00:45:51,166
That's okay.

702
00:45:51,332 --> 00:45:54,335
It wasn't very ladylike to
hit you with a boiled lobster.

703
00:45:54,419 --> 00:45:55,462
It's okay.

704
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:57,505
You can hit me back if you want.

705
00:45:58,631 --> 00:46:00,967
That isn't exactly what I had in mind.

706
00:46:03,386 --> 00:46:05,013
(SQUAWKING)

707
00:46:05,054 --> 00:46:06,723
(HONKING)

708
00:46:09,768 --> 00:46:10,935
Oh!

709
00:46:16,232 --> 00:46:19,486
Herbie! Oh!

710
00:46:20,445 --> 00:46:22,655
Oh, it's time we were getting back.

711
00:46:25,366 --> 00:46:27,243
Herbie, come on!

712
00:46:28,161 --> 00:46:30,538
Leave that sea gull alone!

713
00:46:32,791 --> 00:46:34,083
Herbie!

714
00:46:34,793 --> 00:46:36,419
I wish that car would learn to mind.

715
00:46:37,045 --> 00:46:39,088
Herbie, please!

716
00:46:39,964 --> 00:46:41,883
Herbie!

717
00:46:42,759 --> 00:46:44,886
Heel, Herbie!

718
00:46:47,639 --> 00:46:50,225
See? Just needs a firm hand.

719
00:46:50,308 --> 00:46:54,521
You know, Willoughby,
sometimes you really surprise me.

720
00:47:05,281 --> 00:47:07,116
Hey, what's happening?

721
00:47:10,745 --> 00:47:13,456
(HONKING)

722
00:47:16,751 --> 00:47:19,754
Sorry, sir. My rear axle's frozen.

723
00:47:20,004 --> 00:47:21,005
But, how're we...

724
00:47:21,089 --> 00:47:22,382
Sorry.

725
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:33,726
WILLOUGHBY: No, Herbie!

726
00:47:34,018 --> 00:47:35,144
Ooh!

727
00:47:36,437 --> 00:47:37,897
Whoa!

728
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:44,279
Oh.

729
00:47:47,448 --> 00:47:49,450
Ahh.

730
00:47:49,993 --> 00:47:51,911
Oh!

731
00:47:52,829 --> 00:47:54,831
Ahh!

732
00:47:58,251 --> 00:48:00,587
Oh, well, here we are.

733
00:48:08,261 --> 00:48:09,387
Ah.

734
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:10,471
Nicole?

735
00:48:10,513 --> 00:48:13,349
Very quietly and quickly,
pull your hand back inside the car.

736
00:48:13,433 --> 00:48:14,434
Why?

737
00:48:14,475 --> 00:48:15,476
We've got company.

738
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:17,770
Hmm? (GASPS)

739
00:48:17,812 --> 00:48:21,983
NICOLE: That's ridiculous! Why would
a shark follow a Volkswagen?

740
00:48:22,066 --> 00:48:23,526
WILLOUGHBY:
Because he thinks the same thing I do.

741
00:48:23,651 --> 00:48:25,028
We're going to sink.

742
00:48:33,953 --> 00:48:35,163
WILLOUGHBY: Uh, excuse me.

743
00:48:35,204 --> 00:48:37,123
Can you tell me the way
to San Francisco?

744
00:48:37,165 --> 00:48:41,502
Yeah, man. Straight up the beach road,
first left, second right.

745
00:48:42,337 --> 00:48:43,504
Thank you.

746
00:48:45,632 --> 00:48:47,300
Whoa...

747
00:49:03,358 --> 00:49:05,652
Old number 22, it's gone!

748
00:49:05,693 --> 00:49:07,153
What?

749
00:49:13,034 --> 00:49:14,994
They came with a big truck.

750
00:49:15,328 --> 00:49:17,246
Everything's gone.

751
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:21,042
Who did it?

752
00:49:22,126 --> 00:49:23,711
It said on the truck,

753
00:49:24,087 --> 00:49:27,590
"Alonzo Hawk Van <i>&</i> Storage."

754

Haven't you ever jimmied a lock before?

755
00:49:29,425 --> 00:49:30,718
Of course not.

756
00:49:30,802 --> 00:49:32,261
It isn't a hobby of mine.

757
00:49:32,345 --> 00:49:34,138
Hurry. We can't just stand here.

I want my things back

to go over Niagara Falls in a barrel?

what a fine time those two young people
must be having without me in the way.
