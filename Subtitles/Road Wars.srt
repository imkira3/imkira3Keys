[Music]

111
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:28,879
so it's classic amnesia

112
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:30,159
i'd appear so what would be the cause of

113
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:32,078
that

114
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:34,319
aside from the wounds inflicted upon his

115
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:34,958
capture that doesn't appear to be any

116
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,519
sign of

117
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:39,039
trauma or apparent head injury i'm

118
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,399
ruling on a stroke

119
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:42,559
but i can't rule out viral based

120
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:45,839
encephalitis or some sort of

121
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:49,039
disassociate of psychogenic

122
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:51,519
on the other hand if the cause

123
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:53,278
is viral then he could be one of those

124
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,679
we heard about

125
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:57,360
it's possible i i can't say for sure i

126
00:14:55,679 --> 00:15:00,958
don't have the equipment here to confirm

127
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:03,839
a status

128
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:07,039
he does have some scarring previous

129
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:11,120
entries on his hand arm and torso

130
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:11,120
these all point to a viral cause

131
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,839
thank you

132
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:24,000

days max

143
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:13,519
depending on the intensity of the attack

144
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:16,079
if we get another one like last night

145
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:17,839
maybe even less

146
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:19,919

147
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,480

we owe you a lot now i'm going to ask

149
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,480
you for even more then why would we

150
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:28,479
leave

151
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,639
we go further out in the desert and away

152
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:33,600
from all this

153
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:36,480
who can answer that what do we have here

154
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,480

155
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:44,720
susan

156
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:48,959

157
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:51,278
we have a supply of fresh drinking water

158
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:52,879
we can go further inland we can go all

159
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:55,439
the way to the mountains

160
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:56,879
they won't get us there but we'll all

161
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,720
die just the same

162
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:00,720
y'all i'd be willing to bet that we'd

163
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:04,480
find water inland

164
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,480
when was the last time you saw ray

165
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,480
how many of you are willing to gamble

166
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:12,000
that will find

167
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,120
water this is insanity so we make a run

168
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,640
for the ammunition

169
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:17,279
great some of us die so we've got the

170
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,038
ammo

171
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:20,720
how much of it can we get back here and

172
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,759
how long is it going to last us i mean

173
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,519

174
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:26,400
soon we'll be right back here in this

what he is you risked our future our

244
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:13,520
chance at even having a future by

245
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:15,119
bringing him out here

246
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:17,918
what are you talking about here what are

247
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:17,918
you talking about

248
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:23,120
before the cities fell there was this

249
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:26,240
rumor

250
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:28,479
that uh there were some people that were

251
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:31,359
immune to the virus

252
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,240
i think they got infected they got a

253
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:35,918
fever

254
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:40,159
they fell into a coma when they came out

255
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:42,000
of the coma the virus was gone

256
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:45,039
so we were trying to find some of those

257
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,400
people you know we thought maybe if we

258
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:50,319
got some other blood we could like

259
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,320
develop a serum a vaccine

260
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:59,038
that virus just exploded so fast

261
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:59,038
that's all we could do to survive

262
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:06,240
he infected controlled the cities and we

263
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,240
all fled out into the wasteland

264
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:11,678
so what are you saying you think that

265
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:16,720
that i might be

266
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:16,720
one of these immune people i don't know

267
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:23,359
but what i do know is that

268
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:25,600
the immune people when they woke up out

269
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:28,719
of their coma

270
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:31,119
they had amnesia where were you when you

271
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,120
woke up

272
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:40,480
i was on a lake i was

273
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:44,000
in a boat on a lake um small boat

274
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:46,000
rowboat i had no identification

275
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,679
nothing nothing on me it looked like

276
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,519
i've been said adrift

277
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:51,120
that there was food there was water

278
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:54,319
basic rations

279
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:58,959
they didn't last long and

280
00:27:54,319 --> 00:28:03,519
the sun was unbearable so i swam ashore

281
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:07,120
and when i got ashore i started walking

282
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:07,119
and i walked and i walked

283
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:19,678

emily get back

289
00:29:16,398 --> 00:29:29,839
um i'd only be the bearer of bad news

290
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:29,840
but i think your camp's on fire

291
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:36,240
we got about 10 hours of daylight the

292
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,840
truck's filled with water but frankly

293
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,200
without more ammunition we're not going

294
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:39,918
to be able to make it through another

295
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,919
night

296
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:44,000
we'll get overrun what about hobbs

297
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:45,440
reservoir by the pass

298
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,359
it's not too far away enough i remember

299
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:50,320
the pumping stations work yeah we tried

300
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:52,479
that already the water's contaminated

301
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:54,798
what about the alabama hills near lone

302
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,399
pine i mean we overran them there before

303
00:29:54,798 --> 00:29:57,519
we got here and we didn't have the

304
00:29:56,398 --> 00:29:59,678
weapons we have now

305
00:29:57,519 --> 00:30:00,960
and i know there's water there yeah

306
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:02,559
that's good but there might be other

307
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:07,200
groups there

308
00:30:02,558 --> 00:30:07,200
if you need ammo i might know a place

309
00:30:07,278 --> 00:30:11,919
somewhere i saw about 20 miles away

310
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:15,119
before i came here

311
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:16,559
there was a load of military vehicles

312
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:18,879
just abandoned

313
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:21,839
they're stripped there was something

314
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:24,480
else there was it's a processing plant

315
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:26,720
i think there'd be machine shops there

316
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:29,839
if we can find a lathe

317
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,839
we can make a bullet mold

318
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:39,839
but it's a start isn't it

bring him here what would you do

348
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:37,358
i'd have pulled the trigger like you

349
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:39,918
said you did

350
00:34:37,358 --> 00:34:40,878
all right look take emily back to camp

351
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:51,838
what are you gonna do

352
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:51,838
i'm gonna deal with it

353
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:06,719
but dallas don't look

354
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:09,039
you're going to need a really strong

355
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:12,239
sedative the strongest one we've got

356
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:12,239
talk to susan about that

357
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,720
if we get a serum we're going to need a

358
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:19,118
test subject

359
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:20,639
if you'll agree to that he can live if

360
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:24,079
not take your share of the supplies and

361
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:24,078
go that's the best i can do

362
00:35:27,838 --> 00:35:33,440
good all right get em sedated we're

363
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:36,079
gonna leave in a half hour

364
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,519
he stays chained up just like that and i

365
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:41,039
want a muzzle on him

366
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:41,039
i'm not taking any chances

367
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:47,838
let's go

368
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:15,838
nothing

369
00:36:26,838 --> 00:36:29,838
uh

370
00:36:41,838 --> 00:36:44,880
it's all clear for now

371
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,880
all right first priority is get the high

372
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:54,960
ground all right

373
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,640
get the truck covered up get the solar

374
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,320
panels out but make sure they're not

375
00:36:56,639 --> 00:36:59,759
exposed or they can't be seen by anyone

376
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:02,160
from a distance

377
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:04,000
any kind of trouble shoot up a flare if

378
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:06,319
we're not back by nightfall

379
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,440
don't come looking for us all right just

380
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,280
assume we got stuck

381
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:12,240
somewhere and we'll be back in the

382
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:15,680
morning you got it

383
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:15,679
we should stick together dallas

384
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:19,039
we've been over this

385
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:23,680
where we're going there's a much greater

386
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,440
chance of running into trouble

387
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:26,879
either from night runners or just

388
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:29,119
flat-out hostiles

389
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,960
we'd run a lower profile by ourselves

390
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:32,240
and we don't have to risk everybody for

391
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:35,519
this

392
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:38,479
just be careful hey

393
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:40,480
you too if you see somewhere that looks

394
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:42,320
like a clinic or a medical facility you

395
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:46,320
know what to get

396
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:48,880
centrifuge beakers cooler microscope

397
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,880
incubator

398
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:52,960
maybe they've got an infirmary the mine

399
00:37:51,039 --> 00:38:07,838
or something that we'll keep an eye out

400
00:37:52,960 --> 00:38:07,838
all right good luck thanks

401
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:21,010
[Music]

402
00:38:27,358 --> 00:38:30,480
those things they're nocturnal them

403
00:38:29,838 --> 00:38:33,358
right

404
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:36,000
they don't come out during the day

405
00:38:33,358 --> 00:38:37,759
they're photosensitive

406
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,199
when they first get the virus they could

407
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:41,880
be out in the daylight

408
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:44,799
but it quickly becomes too painful

409
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:48,800
vampires

410
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:51,920
light doesn't kill them

411
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:54,400
so where do they go during the day

412
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,358
look i know what you get find them kill

413
00:38:54,400 --> 00:39:03,220
them while they're vulnerable

414
00:38:55,358 --> 00:39:06,460
exactly we tried that

[Music]

426
00:40:45,199 --> 00:40:47,519
and

427
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:53,039
when the numbers were in our favor it

428
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:56,079
worked

429
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:59,039
but once the infections spread too

430
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:59,039
[ __ ] many of them

431
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:10,079
look if we can rearm ourselves

432
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,720
stabilize maybe we can find a place to

433
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:13,519
hold up

434
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:14,959
try and develop the serum i know it's a

435
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:23,838
long shot

436
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:23,838
it's the best we got

437
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:32,079
i don't like this i for one would rather

438
00:41:29,838 --> 00:41:37,679
be here than where they're going

439
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:40,880
dallas knows what he's doing

440
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:42,399
where are we going they can't come with

441
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,400
us right now sweetie but they'll meet up

442
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:47,358
with us later

443
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,358
somebody woke up

444
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:56,559
when i don't know as soon as they can

445
00:41:52,960 --> 00:42:01,440
i want to go with them

446
00:41:56,559 --> 00:42:03,440
if i get sick will you burn me up

447
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,599
you're not going to get sick i'm here to

448
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:19,838
protect you okay

449
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:19,838
okay okay

450
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:50,720
so when you first found me

451
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:52,560
when you shot me that was because you

452
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:54,000
thought i was one of them what'd you

453
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:57,039
call them night runners

454
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:00,480
the infected yeah

455
00:42:57,039 --> 00:43:01,279
that's right but you found me during the

456
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,039
day

457
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:05,440
and now you're saying they only come out

458
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:05,440
at night

459
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:09,520
maybe i didn't like the way that you

460
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:09,519
looked

461
00:43:12,838 --> 00:43:16,639
no no it's uh we heard from another

462
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:18,000
group

463
00:43:16,639 --> 00:43:20,400
that some of them can come out during

464
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,400
the day

465
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:26,640
day walkers [ __ ] i heard about them

466
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:28,639
from a guy who went into the city

467
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:29,759
he said he saw them in broad daylight

468
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:31,920
hordes of them

469
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:34,640
and it took all he could just to get out

470
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:36,318
maybe the virus mutated i don't know

471
00:43:34,639 --> 00:43:37,679
i'm not a pathogen expert but why would

472
00:43:36,318 --> 00:43:40,719
he make something like that up

473
00:43:37,679 --> 00:43:42,159
until we get clear evidence otherwise we

474
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:45,519
operate based on what we

475
00:43:42,159 --> 00:43:49,679
know stay out of the dark

476
00:43:45,519 --> 00:43:57,838
stick together at night don't get bitten

477
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:57,838
we deal with what we know

478
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:04,640
and there's a few of them they're easy

479
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:06,318
to manage in case of night runners you

480
00:44:04,639 --> 00:44:08,078
get a small number you can fend them off

481
00:44:06,318 --> 00:44:11,039
pretty easy

482
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:13,359
you see a big bunch run they're like

483
00:44:11,039 --> 00:44:16,239
locus

484
00:44:13,358 --> 00:44:17,519
again a large group their behavior

485
00:44:16,239 --> 00:44:19,759
changes

486
00:44:17,519 --> 00:44:20,639
when they start collecting together they

487
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,839
get more

488
00:44:20,639 --> 00:44:25,279
violent more aggressive it's off the

489
00:44:22,838 --> 00:44:29,039
scale

490
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:29,040
the more than they are the worse it is

491
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:33,919
it's like they're different species

492
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:37,760
instead of an individual they act as one

493
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:38,639
and i've seen it a wave i've been on

494
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:43,040
death

495
00:44:38,639 --> 00:44:46,078
and destruction every ounce of energy

496
00:44:43,039 --> 00:44:48,559
used to feed kill

497
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:48,560
infect

498
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:53,920
where are they now it depends how recent

499
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:55,679
this attack was

500
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:57,039
they stripped the town of victims they

501
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:58,639
might be long gone

502
00:44:57,039 --> 00:45:00,239
yeah but if it's recent you can bet that

503
00:44:58,639 --> 00:45:06,799
they're still here

504
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:12,078
hiding in the dark

505
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:15,440
over there that looks like a mine

506
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:17,760
gold might have had to guess oh great

507
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:19,599
but mine you can stay in the car if you

508
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:21,680
want who's gonna have your back papa

509
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:35,838
smurf

510
00:45:21,679 --> 00:45:35,838

so

514
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:07,039
like that you know how to use that

515
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:17,838
i think i can figure it out

516
00:46:19,519 --> 00:46:23,358

make a serum we can test

771

to start basic medical equipment syringe

needles we have those already beyond

773
01:07:19,358 --> 01:07:22,639
that

774
01:07:20,159 --> 01:07:24,159
we need test tubes and a centrifuge with

775
01:07:22,639 --> 01:07:27,358
that we can separate

776
01:07:24,159 --> 01:07:29,519
antibodies from plasma so medical supply

01:07:27,358 --> 01:07:34,000
cuff only work if it hasn't been looted

01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:51,039
it's a farm and a research facility

784
01:07:48,159 --> 01:07:51,679
we could set up and do the testing there

785
01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:53,760
so

786
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:59,838
then we take everybody might be the only
