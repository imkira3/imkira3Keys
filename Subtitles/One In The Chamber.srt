2
00:03:58,471 --> 00:04:00,348
law and order broke down.

3
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:02,853
Organized crime rose in its place-

4
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:05,515
not that it wasn't there before.

5
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:08,116
But after that,
it became open season,

6
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:11,458
everyone looking for a fistful of Euros,
myself included.

7
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:17,029
When one mob family has a problem
with another, they call me.

8
00:04:17,056 --> 00:04:19,195
For the right price, I solve it.

9
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:22,399
I'm a fixer.
That's what I do.

10
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,533
But that's not the only reason
I'm here.

11
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:39,807
Hey, man.
It's been a while, Demyan.

12
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,477
What's up, brother?

13
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:44,750
- Liev, good to see you. I'm fine.
- Vlad is waiting for you upstairs.

14
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:57,333
( Phone ringing )

15
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,963
- Man: Hello?
- Yes, Nicholi. Yes.

16
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:01,835
We're ready on our end.

17
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:04,239
Everything is in place
and ready for the shipment.

18
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:08,712
Perfect. We'll be ready to deliver it
within the next 43 hours.

19
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:16,186
What can I say, Vlad?
It's been a pleasure.

20
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,090
I'll call you after it's arrived.

21
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:29,691
(Vlad chuckling)

22
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,724
Welcome back, my friend.

23
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,369
It's good to be back, Vlad.

24
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:39,172
You were away too goddamn long,
you know that?

25
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:41,007
I had to drink alone.

26
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:43,479
I am sure
this was no problem for you.

27
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:44,607
- Eh?

28
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:46,938
- Let's drink together.
- Come on.

29
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:38,561
Thank you, Nadia.

30
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:43,240
So, tell me about Grozny.

31
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:48,177
This deal, it went well.
Because they're looking after our interest.

32
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:51,580
I figured as much,
but I meant tell me about the city.

33
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:55,279
I have heard they almost rebuilt it now
brick for brick.

34
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,754
It's still Grozny.

35
00:07:57,777 --> 00:07:59,518
Remember Sergei?

36
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:04,460
He shot that bitch
just for scuffing his boot.

37
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,555
He was a crazy bastard.

38
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:11,697
So many of our brothers
died in Chechnya.

39
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:20,410
To Sergei.

40
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:23,573
- To Sergei.
-( glasses clink)

41
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:30,353
You know, someone
should go back there

42
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:33,152
and knock it down again
for old times' sake.

43
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,455
Vlad,

44
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:37,893
the war is long over, hmm?

45
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:41,990
Not in here it isn't.
Not for me.

46
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:44,126
- Vlad?
- I'm busy.

47
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:46,158
It's Mikhail Suverov.

48
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:54,006
Mikhail, good to hear from you.

49
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:57,503
We drew lines in the sand,
you and I.

50
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,175
You've wiped them clean.

51
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:06,654
What are you talking about?

52
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:11,560
You're doing business with Nicholi Dvorak
without my green light.

53
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:13,359
Bullshit.

54
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,525
Who the hell told you this?

55
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,434
Someone who knew.

56
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:21,995
Look, I don't know
who this man is,

57
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:24,201
but whoever it is,
he's lying to you.

58
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,301
He's trying to turn us
against each other.

59
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:28,437
The problem I have with that

60
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:32,176
is that his is not the only mouth
I've heard this from.

61
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:35,276
You know how it goes-
you hear things so many times,

62
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:37,811
there's maybe probably
some truth to it.

63
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:43,293
It's not what you think.
Nicholi, he came to us.

64
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:47,389
(chuckling )
Of course he did, my friend.

65
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,835
You're trying to take my business
from beneath me.

66
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:55,134
You're undercutting me
by five points.

67
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:59,303
You killed three years
of peace between us

68
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:01,369
for a handful of silver, Vlad.

69
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:06,213
And I have just killed you.

70
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:08,184
No, wait--

71
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:44,210
(screaming )

72
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:14,910
(cocking 9'-I")

73
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:18,616
Vlad? Demyan?
Talk to me.

74
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:21,056
We are pinned down.
He's got a gunman with .50 cal

75
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,186
across the street,
shooting through a window.

76
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:26,992
When you find him,
you murder the son of a bitch.

77
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,498
( Crashes )

78
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:31,563
Across the street.
Go, go.

79
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,763
(gunfire)

80
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:44,678
-( Nadia screams)
- Ah!

81
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,096
- Come on!
- Ah!

82
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:02,156
- Come on!
- No, no!

83
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,438
Shit.

84
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:14,945
( Nadia whimpering )

85
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:24,814
( Nadia whimpers, screams)

86
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:00,247
(chains creak)

87
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:06,125
Is he done?

88
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:16,430
Get rid of that.

89
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:20,742
What are you waiting for?
Get rid of it.

90
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:24,213
And make sure he disappears.
We don't want any combat.

91
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,893
Hey, you, stop!

92
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:45,535
I said stop!

93
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:51,474
Turn the fuck around.

94
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:56,035
I said turn around!

95
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,418
(gunfire pops)

96
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:46,546
(siren wails)

97
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:04,671
( keys jangle)

98
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:36,702
Fixer's voice: There are those who say
it's a blessing to know who you are,

99
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:40,142
what you've been destined
to do in life.

100
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,736
But to me
it's more like a curse.

101
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,648
How did I end up here?

102
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:52,053
A series of random events, fate.

103
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:55,581
It's hard to tell anymore.

104
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:58,322
But here I am.

105
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,523
The money's good,

106
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:02,554
but you still pay a price.

107
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:19,682
(faint chanting)

108
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:30,085
(chanting continues)

109
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:01,551
(alarm beeping )

110
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:10,728
( beeping stops )

111
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:24,213
( muttering )

112
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:52,072
Fixer's voice:
Isaiah 43:13--

113
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:56,102
"Forget the former things;
do not dwell in the past."

114
00:18:57,102 --> 00:18:59,480
If there's one thing in life
I know that's true,

115
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:01,507
it's that the past is the devil.

116
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:04,919
You can't run from it.
It's always behind you.

117
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,346
- Hey.
- Ciao.

118
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:54,129
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Janice.

119
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:19,080
Yes, it arrives tomorrow.

120
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,682
( Chuckles )
Me as well, my friend.

121
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:24,660
I'll call you with an update
as soon as I know more.

122
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:27,560
Speak then.

123
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:34,195
Bobby.

124
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:38,033
- How'd it go?
- Good.

125
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:39,906
He's chomping at the bit
to get the cargo.

126
00:21:39,931 --> 00:21:43,208
- Hmm. Has it left Damascus yet?
- No.

127
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:45,647
It only left Astrakhan
an hour ago.

128
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:48,550
It should be there
about three and a half hours.

129
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:49,950
And the turnaround?

130
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:52,182
It should hit Colombia
by late tomorrow evening.

131
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:55,157
Say two hours
for offload, reload, refuel,

132
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,922
and then another 23 hours
back again.

133
00:21:57,949 --> 00:22:01,089
We should be good to go
by the end of the week.

134
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:02,792
Is good.

135
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:05,233
Go and get the car.

136
00:22:06,224 --> 00:22:09,364
(cell phone chiming, beeps)

137
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:10,600
Da??

138
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:12,973
I am calling
to negotiate terms.

139
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:15,944
Who the fuck is this?

140
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:18,208
Mikhail, my father always told me,

141
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:20,341
never ask a question
you already know the answer.

142
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:21,874
You waste my fucking time.

143
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:24,251
You thought I was dead,
didn't you?

144
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:26,950
( Mutters )
Demyan.

145
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:31,584
Look, Mikhail,
I hold the reins now.

146
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:34,995
And fortunately for both you and I,
we are at the reset point.

147
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,728
So I figure it's best
we negotiate terms swiftly

148
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:39,633
while there's still blood
in the water.

149
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:42,104
Da. I'm listening.

150
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:46,941
You crawl into Vlad's grave
and bury yourself alive,

151
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:50,674
or I will find you
and I'll kill you

152
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:53,273
and I'll bury you myself.

153
00:22:54,272 --> 00:22:57,014
Those are my terms.

154
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,077
( Beeps )

155
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:13,397
(woman screaming)

156
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:15,302
(grunting )

157
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:44,057
What now?

158
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,228
We hit them harder
than they hit us.

159
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:49,068
I am going to unleash hell.

160
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,033
Go.

161
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:55,374
We need to think this through.
We need to be smart.

162
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,744
I'm going to destroy him.

163
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:00,875
Yeah, but we go to war with Demyan
and we can't go through Leo.

164
00:24:00,906 --> 00:24:05,355
His cleaner screwing up and
not eliminating Demyan as well as Vlad

165
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:07,755
is the reason we have the problem
in the first place.

166
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:10,953
But he's the only independent
in town.

167
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:13,428
So what do you suggest?

168
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:16,533
Did you ever hear of the Wolf?

169
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:19,524
(chuckles)

170
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:21,037
He's a fairy tale.

171
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:25,371
Tsk-tsk-tsk. The stories I hear,
they're no fairy tale.

172
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:29,870
Ari Perovsky has his number.

173
00:24:31,903 --> 00:24:33,780
( Keypad beeping )

174
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:39,751
(dog barking )

175
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:42,258
( phone ringing )

176
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,055
( barking continues)

177
00:24:46,117 --> 00:24:48,927
- Shut it.
-( ringing )

178
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:52,902
- What?
- Is this the man they call the Wolf?

179
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:55,370
I prefer Aleksey,
but yes, they're one and the same.

180
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:57,964
Can you be in Prague
by tomorrow?

181
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:00,067
That's a bit
short notice there, mate.

182
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:02,271
We'll double your rate.

183
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:06,840
Okay, text me an address.
And until then, fuck off.

184
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:08,909
( Phone beeps )

185
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:12,080
Sorry about that.

186
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:14,522
Now about that money
you be owing' Slim Jimmy...

187
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:18,790
So, they sent a dog
to collect their scraps.

188
00:25:19,784 --> 00:25:23,288
Actually they sent a wolf.

189
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:42,482
( Men grunting )

190
00:25:45,977 --> 00:25:48,287
Go!

191
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:58,026
(cracks, thug groans)

192
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:12,470
( moans)

193
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,221
- Can you pay?
-( bone cracks)

194
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:21,019
Ahhh!

195
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:22,650
'Will yo "' Pa '2 _Yes!! v.

196
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:24,524
-( Bone cracks)
- Ahh!

197
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:27,826
- When?
- Ah! Stop, God damn it!

198
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:30,196
It's in the other room.

199
00:26:31,389 --> 00:26:33,369
-( Bone cracks)
- Ah! Okay, okay!

200
00:26:33,391 --> 00:26:36,372
It's in the vault behind the bar!

201
00:26:39,397 --> 00:26:41,673
(whines)

202
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:44,946
Ah-hh!

203
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:15,237
One for the client...

204
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,811
and the rest for me.

205
00:27:25,176 --> 00:27:26,849
( Knuckles pop)

206
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:35,724
- Good dog.
-( barks )

207
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:45,063
Fixer's voice: I've been watching her
for a long time now.

208
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:49,300
We're like two trains on the same track
headed for a collision course.

209
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:52,035
I've been reluctant
to deal with it.

210
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:54,168
But sooner or later,
if I don't,

211
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:56,907
it will deal with me.

212
00:28:56,935 --> 00:29:00,246
- The time is near.
-( phone ringing )

213
00:29:03,608 --> 00:29:04,882
Is that you, Leo?

214
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:08,322
Leo: Usual place, tomorrow,
half past 3:00.

215
00:29:08,346 --> 00:29:09,848
- Hey, listen, it's my--
-( phone clicks)

216
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,144
Excuse me.

217
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,935
Well, hello, Ray.

218
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,566
One unaccounted for.

219
00:29:58,596 --> 00:30:00,405
Yeah, so I was told.

220
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:03,969
Hey, man, Mikhail is the one
who asked to make a show of it.

221
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:07,347
If you didn't agree to the terms,
you shouldn't have accepted the job, Ray.

222
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:08,942
Fair enough.

223
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:10,714
He shouldn't have
pulled a woman in front of him.

224
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:12,415
She was a whore.

225
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:18,192
We work on results, Ray,
not excuses. You know that.

226
00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:21,095
I will finish with Demyan.
I can promise you that.

227
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:23,497
You're a day late and a dollar short
for that, my friend.

228
00:30:23,521 --> 00:30:27,298
They've already hired in
another shooter for the job.

229
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:29,498
So where does that leave me?

230
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:32,974
I strongly doubt
that Mr. Mikhail Suverov

231
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:37,309
will be requiring my services
anytime soon due to this little fiasco.

232
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:41,044
They're angry, Ray.
And who can blame them?

233
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:44,815
There's a million like Suverov,
just like him.

234
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:47,346
Why do you think I rang?

235
00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:59,701
Another gig in my own back yard
doesn't exactly sit well with me, Leo.

236
00:30:59,724 --> 00:31:02,705
Besides, this looks like
we're biting the hand that feeds us.

237
00:31:02,727 --> 00:31:05,503
Not if the hand isn't
feeding you anymore, it isn't.

238
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,601
Demyan wants to retaliate.

239
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:10,203
And he's willing to pay
a lot more than the Suverovs.

240
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:13,182
And hitting both brothers, well...

241
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:15,946
he'll pay extra for that.

242
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:19,217
Hey, Ray?
We started a war here.

243
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:21,656
Wars are good for business.

244
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:25,354
So you can cash in
or you can cash out.

245
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:27,863
The choice is yours.

246

I'm looking for Bobby Suverov.

256
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:25,684
And who the hell are you?

257
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:27,883
Aleksey Andreev.

258
00:32:27,912 --> 00:32:29,289
Who?

259
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:34,285
Fuck you, that's who.

260
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:38,063

And you are?

269
00:33:10,855 --> 00:33:13,768
Hungry, tired, thirsty.

270
00:33:13,791 --> 00:33:15,566
Aleksey.

00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:19,365
Come. Come!

272
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,836
What do you want?

273
00:33:23,868 --> 00:33:26,940
Ahem.
Well, I don't know.

274
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:28,712
What would you recommend
to be sipping on

275
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,947
in a wet fucking heat
like the here and now?

276
00:33:30,975 --> 00:33:34,980
A tall glass of ice water
coupled with shots, sir.

277
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,424
Are you all right with shots?

278
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:38,791
I prefer it, in fact.

279
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:42,730
Appleton Estate, 30-year-old rum
from Jamaica, sir.

280
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:45,496
I think it would be
perfect in here, sir.

281
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:53,539
I'm digging
the sales pitch there, boyo.

282
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:55,737
I'll give it a go.

283
00:33:57,201 --> 00:34:00,774
So, my friend,
how do we begin?

284
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:03,115
Introductions would be nice.

285
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:05,348

Aleksey.

288
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:15,026
As for my unfortunate moniker,
I'd rather you not use it.

289
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,964
It's so goddamn clichÃ©.

290
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:20,333
Yeah, whatever.
Aleksey, tell me,

291
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:22,861
what do you know
about the current state of play

292
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,771
here in the Golden City?

293
00:34:24,796 --> 00:34:27,072
Same old, same old,
I'd assume.

294
00:34:27,098 --> 00:34:30,079
Two parties of different opinions

295
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:32,911
gnawing at each other's throats
over trivialities.

296
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:37,351
- I like the way you think.
- I don't...

297
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:41,346
think, that is.
I simply do.

298
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:44,417
What exactly is it
that you do?

299
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:45,951
(sighs)

300
00:34:45,983 --> 00:34:48,293
I play chess with the old Boromets
in the park

301
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:50,663
every Tuesday,
Thursday afternoon.

302
00:34:50,688 --> 00:34:54,534
I restore cars from the '70s,
pinball machines from the '90s,

303
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:56,869
and if you pay me enough,

304
00:34:56,894 --> 00:35:00,000
I'll probably kill
anything that breathes.

305
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:01,442
Probably?

306
00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:06,876
As in no innocent party, mate.

307
00:35:06,904 --> 00:35:10,374
Kids are off the table regardless,
but I have no problem with women.

308
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:12,081
Although I only shoot them.

309
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,181
Using your hands
or a blade on a lady

310
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:18,558
just comes across as rather weak
and rather tacky, you know?

311
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:20,187
That's fair enough.

312
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:27,201
So what is it
that you want me to do?

313
00:35:30,661 --> 00:35:32,436
Wreak havoc.

314
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:34,670
This is Demyan lvanov,

315
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:38,306
his underboss Grigori Rikoniev,
and his number two.

316
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:41,317
And Nicholi Dvorak,
local Czech scum.

317
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:47,314
Nicholi is the one that started this,
so he's up first.

318
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,615
-( Muffled gunfire)
-( dull thud )

319
00:36:31,455 --> 00:36:33,264
Hello, Nicholi.

320
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:35,631
Who are you?

321
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:38,604
A trained monkey.

322
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:45,970
But well enough paid

323
00:36:46,003 --> 00:36:48,381
to do the little touch.

324
00:37:13,664 --> 00:37:15,837
What are you doing, Ray?

325
00:37:24,508 --> 00:37:25,748
Seriously, it's time to go.

326
00:37:25,776 --> 00:37:27,551
I haven't finished my drink.

327
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:30,457
Just finish the one you've got
and pay.

328
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:32,518
( Belches )

329
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,325
Ha.

330
00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:37,299
Bring me another drink now.

331
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:39,699
Sorry, we're closed.
You've had enough. Go.

332
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:42,898
Oh, yeah, bitch?
Then I'm taking this with me.

333
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,998
- You're not taking anything-
- Get your fucking-

334
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:48,944
- Ah!
- Let go of him.

335
00:37:48,966 --> 00:37:50,741
Okay, okay, I'll go.

336
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:54,113
It's okay. Let go, please.
It's okay. Um...

337
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:59,087
- Everything okay, Janice?
- Yeah, it's fine. It's okay.

338
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:02,518
- I'm sorry about that.
- No, no, no, no.

339
00:38:02,546 --> 00:38:05,720
No use crying over spilt milk.

340
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:08,526
Huh. You're American.

341
00:38:08,552 --> 00:38:10,259
Yeah.

342
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,700
- Give me a sec, okay?
- No, that's okay.

343
00:38:12,723 --> 00:38:15,226
No, I'll take care of this.
It'll just be a second.

344
00:38:15,259 --> 00:38:17,569
Club soda and salt,
works every time.

345
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:52,969
(bell ringing)

346
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:55,841
-( cheering )
-( machine fluttering )

347
00:38:55,866 --> 00:38:59,609
(announcer speaking faintly)

348
00:39:01,372 --> 00:39:04,319
First they killed Vlad,
and then Demyan becomes boss.

349
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:07,323
But is he happy
about his accidental promotion?

350
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,985
No.
The bastard appreciates nothing.

351
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:11,925
Hey, they served together
in Chechnya.

352
00:39:11,949 --> 00:39:14,020
Vlad took a bullet for Demyan.

353
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:16,224
- They were brothers in blood.
- So what?

354
00:39:16,253 --> 00:39:17,891
Does that make me
less of a man

355
00:39:17,922 --> 00:39:20,198
because I didn't kill bitches
with them in Grozny?

356
00:39:20,224 --> 00:39:23,137
I mean, what about me?
First I'm the underboss's underboss,

357
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,470
and then the boss dies
and what does that make me?

358
00:39:25,496 --> 00:39:27,874
I'm still a fucking underboss.

359
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,945
Life is shit.

360
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:34,677
You always see the glass half empty
when you drink, Grigori.

361
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:40,218
Oh, by the way,
my glass is empty, Liev.

362
00:39:40,244 --> 00:39:43,817
Tell me, if I always
get to refill your fucking drinks,

363
00:39:43,848 --> 00:39:45,919
then what does that make me?

364
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:49,124
An underboss.

365
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:53,598
(thunder rumbling,
rain pattering )

366
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:55,729
-( beeps )
- Two at table two,

367
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,637
one at table three,

368
00:39:57,661 --> 00:40:00,335
four at table six,

369
00:40:00,364 --> 00:40:02,071
three at table eight.

370
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:05,980
Two clips, 17 rounds apiece,
makes 34.

371
00:40:06,003 --> 00:40:09,644
10 men, three rounds apiece,
four slated to miss.

372
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:22,896
Oi!

373
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,662
Which one of you poor fools
is Grigori?

374
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:33,867
Who the fuck are you?

375
00:40:58,689 --> 00:41:02,865
So the left's
only three in the clip,

376
00:41:02,893 --> 00:41:05,635
and the right...

377
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:16,650
-( casing clatters)
- one in the chamber.

378
00:41:20,244 --> 00:41:22,918
It was a thing of beauty, no?

379
00:41:31,288 --> 00:41:34,531
( Indistinct voice
over speaker )

380
00:42:07,925 --> 00:42:10,064
(soft music playing )

381
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:18,642
(sniffs)

382
00:42:18,669 --> 00:42:21,513
You know that shit
that killed Elvis, right?

383
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,644
This shit here
definitely would.

384
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:25,483
( laughs)

385
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:29,956
Well, if it killed Elvis, it could kill me
and maybe I don't want to do it.

386
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:33,450
Baby, relax.
It's just an expression. Come on.

387
00:42:33,484 --> 00:42:37,330
Well, it doesn't sound good.
You should think of a different expression.

388
00:42:37,354 --> 00:42:39,265
Just fucking do it.
Shut up.

389
00:42:45,429 --> 00:42:47,067
( Inhaling )

390
00:42:48,933 --> 00:42:51,345
( laughs )
I told you, right?

391
00:43:01,278 --> 00:43:02,757
Baby?

392
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:04,691
What really did kill Elvis?

393
00:43:04,715 --> 00:43:08,390
That? Pills, something.
I don't know. Fuck.

394
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:18,998
- You.
- Out.

395
00:43:22,232 --> 00:43:25,577
You-- you worked for us.

396
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:28,015
Not anymore.

397
00:43:29,006 --> 00:43:31,782
Look, whatever it is
they're paying you,

398
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:34,289
Mikhail will double it.

399
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:37,657
Okay?
He'll triple it.

400
00:43:44,355 --> 00:43:48,030
No, wait. I mean...

401
00:43:48,058 --> 00:43:50,732
I'm his only brother.

402
00:43:50,761 --> 00:43:53,264
He should have had another.

403
00:43:58,669 --> 00:44:02,776
( Crying )
It's Bobby! It's Bobby!

404
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:04,479
- What do you mean? What do you mean?
- There's someone out there!

405
00:44:04,508 --> 00:44:06,385
He's got a gun!

406
00:44:31,802 --> 00:44:33,406
No!

407
00:44:54,291 --> 00:44:56,032
( Beeps )

408
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:57,630
( ringing )

409
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:01,610
( phone rings)

410
00:45:07,471 --> 00:45:09,314
(grunts, girl yelps)

411
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:15,015
-( beeps )
- Yeah?

412
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:16,991
What the fuck is going on,
Andrei?

413
00:45:17,014 --> 00:45:19,153
What's happened
to my goddamn update?

414
00:45:19,183 --> 00:45:21,857
Yeah, Leo--

415
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:24,627
Leo's man took care
of Bobby last night.

416
00:45:24,655 --> 00:45:26,657
And Mikhail?

417
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:30,797
From what I understand, he walked in
only seconds after the job was done.

418
00:45:30,828 --> 00:45:33,866
Hmm.
This is fucking beautiful.

419
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:37,470
Yeah, I hear it's really
fucked Mikhail up.

420
00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:40,675
Of course it did.
This was his brother.

421
00:45:40,704 --> 00:45:42,706
He's been looking out for this kid
his whole life.

422
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:46,586
Maybe this time he should try
looking out a little harder.

423
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:49,454
I, uh...

424
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:52,188
I got bits of bad news.

425
00:45:52,216 --> 00:45:54,992
What exactly is bad news, Andrei?

426
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:59,090
They hit Nicholi Dvorak.

427
00:45:59,123 --> 00:46:00,659
What?

428
00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:05,106
The police found him floating in the pool,
9mm to the head.

429
00:46:05,129 --> 00:46:06,767
It's not the end of the world.

430
00:46:06,797 --> 00:46:08,902
We'll find somebody else
to do the business with.

431
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:14,776
Andrei, is this it?
This is the bad news?

432
00:46:15,973 --> 00:46:18,817
Nicholi isn't the only one
who got hit.

433
00:46:18,842 --> 00:46:21,789
What are you talking about?
Who else?

434
00:46:21,812 --> 00:46:25,487
Somebody hit
the booking house.

435
00:46:27,217 --> 00:46:28,855
Killed everybody-

436
00:46:28,886 --> 00:46:30,797
killed all the boys.

437
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:33,624
Grigori?

438
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:38,801
Grigori, Liev--
everybody there dead.

439
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:49,114
What about my money?

440
00:46:50,174 --> 00:46:51,983
I'm not sure.

441
00:46:52,009 --> 00:46:53,613
What the fuck do you mean
you're not sure?!

442
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,624
L-- I just got bits and pieces.

443
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:57,489
The cops were crawling
out of the place.

444
00:46:57,514 --> 00:47:00,290
- I couldn't stay for long, but--
- But nothing!

445
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:04,129
- Find my goddamn money, Andrei!
- Yes, boss. I understand, yes.

446
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:06,395
Just give me some time
to make some calls.

447
00:47:06,423 --> 00:47:08,767
Give me 20 minutes
and I'll call you right back.

448
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,831
You've only got 10.

449
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:14,634
( Beeps )

450
00:47:38,655 --> 00:47:41,033
( doorbell buzzes )

451
00:47:47,831 --> 00:47:50,368
( buzzing )

452
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:01,885
( buzzes )

453
00:48:09,786 --> 00:48:12,164
- Hey-
- Hey-

454
00:48:12,189 --> 00:48:13,862
There you are.

455
00:48:15,025 --> 00:48:16,698
You left your jacket.

456
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:20,038
Oh, right.
How'd you find me?

457
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:23,510
Oh.
I found this in your pocket.

458
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:29,351
- ( Chuckles )
- Address. Nice.

459
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:31,114
It's clean, by the way.

460
00:48:31,141 --> 00:48:32,711
Oh. How much do I owe you?

461
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:35,383
No, no, no. I did it myself.
It's good.

462
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:37,653
Lucky for me, the right address
was in the envelope,

463
00:48:37,681 --> 00:48:39,558
because it didn't have your name.

464
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:41,893
- I'm Ray.
- Oh.

465
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:44,559
- Just Ray?
- Ray Carver.

466
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:48,331
I'm Janice.
Look, I'm sorry for just stopping by.

467
00:48:48,358 --> 00:48:51,430
I just wanted to say thank you.
You know, you took off so fast, I--

468
00:48:51,461 --> 00:48:54,135
No, I'm glad you did. I--

469
00:48:54,164 --> 00:48:55,700
I guess I owe you one.

470
00:48:55,732 --> 00:48:57,803
Oh. yeah?

471
00:48:57,834 --> 00:48:59,836
Okay.

472
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:02,441
Well, in that case, um...

473
00:49:03,674 --> 00:49:04,709
Mmm.

474
00:49:09,379 --> 00:49:10,619
Fair enough.

475
00:49:10,647 --> 00:49:12,888
Well, hopefully I'll--
I'll talk to you soon.

476
00:49:12,916 --> 00:49:14,452
Hopefully.

477
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:17,796
Bye.

478
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,762
( Sighs )
Shit.

479
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:27,901
Did you lock yourself out?

480
00:49:27,931 --> 00:49:30,537
Nope, I'm good.
See ya.

481
00:49:30,567 --> 00:49:32,706
Okay.

482
00:50:00,197 --> 00:50:02,768
So...

483
00:50:02,799 --> 00:50:04,642
am I still on the payroll?

484
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:06,204
Hmm.

485
00:50:06,236 --> 00:50:08,273
What would you have me do?

486
00:50:09,906 --> 00:50:12,079
If it were my way,

487
00:50:12,109 --> 00:50:14,953
I would have you raze this city
to the ground

488
00:50:14,978 --> 00:50:18,187
and salt every inch of it.

489
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:21,958
But I made a promise
to my brother

490
00:50:21,985 --> 00:50:26,297
to be smart,
to think things through.

491
00:50:27,758 --> 00:50:30,034
Come with me.

492
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:49,152
Mikhail.

493
00:50:49,179 --> 00:50:51,125
Leo.

494
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:57,331
Hey, Aleksey.

495
00:50:58,622 --> 00:51:00,295
I heard you were in town.

496
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:05,066
He's very expensive,
but he's worth it.

497
00:51:05,095 --> 00:51:06,665
You two have met?

498
00:51:06,696 --> 00:51:08,141
(chuckles)

499
00:51:08,165 --> 00:51:12,375
Let's just say that we both run
in similar circles.

500
00:51:13,437 --> 00:51:15,815
Why am I here, Mikhail?

501
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:19,252
Your boy, whoever he is,

502
00:51:19,276 --> 00:51:22,189
he didn't finish the job
with Demyan,

503
00:51:22,212 --> 00:51:25,056
but he sure hit a home run

504
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:27,392
when he killed my brother.

505
00:51:28,385 --> 00:51:32,231
Now exactly which boy
are we talking about?

506
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:36,101
Bobby's girl
saw the black bastard.

507
00:51:36,126 --> 00:51:37,969
Come on, Leo, be honest.

508
00:51:37,994 --> 00:51:41,737
How many monkeys
are there in this city?

509
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:48,272
Playing both sides
is a very dangerous game, my friend.

510
00:51:49,906 --> 00:51:51,681
I want to know his name

511
00:51:51,708 --> 00:51:54,484
and I want to know
where he sleeps.

512
00:51:54,511 --> 00:51:57,720
Come on, Mikhail,
you're taking a piss.

513
00:51:57,747 --> 00:51:59,749
What sort of handler
would I be

514
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:03,060
if I kept tossing out the names
of my assets, eh?

515
00:52:03,086 --> 00:52:05,066
You disrespect me.

516
00:52:05,088 --> 00:52:08,399
You are lucky to be alive!

517
00:52:08,425 --> 00:52:11,269
You accepted the contract
for my brother.

518
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:14,434
That makes you
directly involved in his death.

519
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:19,038
You should be counting your
fucking blessings that I am asking you.

520
00:52:19,069 --> 00:52:22,915
My black bastard
isn't mine anymore.

521
00:52:26,376 --> 00:52:29,983
Not since he cost me
my livelihood with you.

522
00:52:30,013 --> 00:52:33,722
Come on, Mikhail!
You're my best client.

523
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:35,787
Do I look that stupid?

524
00:52:36,786 --> 00:52:39,892
If you're lying to me,
I'll cut your fucking head off.

525
00:52:39,923 --> 00:52:42,767
I don't doubt you, Mikhail.

526
00:52:42,792 --> 00:52:45,705
I've known you for a long time.

527
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:50,468
You tell me everything you know
about this boy.

528
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:56,817
I will tell you one thing-

529
00:52:57,807 --> 00:53:00,583
if you go looking for him,

530
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:03,784
he'll find you first.
I promise you.

531
00:54:13,049 --> 00:54:14,790
That's not him.

532
00:54:59,896 --> 00:55:02,638
-( Siren wailing)
-( honking )

533
00:55:02,666 --> 00:55:05,169
( indistinct police radio)

534
00:55:11,741 --> 00:55:13,186
( phone beeps )

535
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:18,418
( ringing )

536
00:55:18,448 --> 00:55:21,190
This is longer than 10 minutes.

537
00:55:21,217 --> 00:55:24,824
I'm sorry. I had to reach out
to a friend of mine at the department.

538
00:55:24,854 --> 00:55:25,992
It wasn't easy.

539
00:55:30,527 --> 00:55:32,438
And?

540
00:55:32,462 --> 00:55:34,772
The cops took the money.

541
00:55:34,798 --> 00:55:36,778
They have it in evidence
downtown.

542
00:55:39,135 --> 00:55:41,513
I did find out, though,

543
00:55:41,538 --> 00:55:43,540
that there was a survivor
at the betting room,

544
00:55:43,573 --> 00:55:46,110
one of the bookies.
He saw the whole thing.

545
00:55:46,142 --> 00:55:48,918
According to him,
this huge guy

546
00:55:48,945 --> 00:55:50,754
came right to the front door,

547
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:54,318
called out Grigori,
whipped out two 9mms

548
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:56,297
and started blazing.

549
00:55:56,319 --> 00:55:58,993
One guy?
This is bullshit, Andrei.

550
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:02,367
What the bookie said he looked like
is even crazier.

551
00:56:02,392 --> 00:56:03,803
What do you mean?

552
00:56:03,827 --> 00:56:06,364
Seven-foot tall,
wearing a tacky Hawaiian shirt

553
00:56:06,396 --> 00:56:07,704
with a white fedora.

554
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:13,139
He said he looked like
a Frank Sinatra on steroids.

555
00:56:14,137 --> 00:56:15,673
The Wolf.

556
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:18,242
What?

557
00:56:18,274 --> 00:56:20,185
Mikhail-

558
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:22,713
he hired an out-of-towner.
He hired the Wolf.

559
00:56:22,746 --> 00:56:26,159
But the Wolf is just
a bullshit ghost story.

560
00:56:26,182 --> 00:56:29,186
No.
No, he's as real as it gets.

561
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:32,223
He must have been the same one
who took out Vlad as well.

562
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:35,733
What are we going to do?

563
00:56:35,759 --> 00:56:37,295
What the fuck
do you think we're going to do?

564
00:56:37,327 --> 00:56:38,863
We're going to go Wolf hunting.

565
00:56:41,831 --> 00:56:44,004
Everyone bleeds, Andrei.

566
00:56:44,033 --> 00:56:48,072
Put the word out-- I will pay top dollar
to find this guy, okay?

567
00:56:48,104 --> 00:56:51,608
- Okay, I understand.
- Good.

568
00:56:51,641 --> 00:56:53,848
Meet me tomorrow
at the betting room at 5:00.

569
00:56:53,877 --> 00:56:56,187
Don't be late,
and fuckin' bring me something.

570
00:56:56,212 --> 00:56:59,091
- Something good.
- Okay.

571
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:01,460
( Phone beeps )

572
00:57:06,356 --> 00:57:09,428
Leo, this is my third message.

573
00:57:09,459 --> 00:57:11,063
What the hell is going on?

574
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:13,074
How'd they know
I was going to be there?

575
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:14,803
Call me back!

576
00:57:14,831 --> 00:57:16,333
( Phone beeps )

577
00:57:18,067 --> 00:57:19,569
( doorbell buzzes )

578
00:57:27,043 --> 00:57:29,182
( buzzing )

579
00:57:31,748 --> 00:57:33,489
( door closes, keys rattle )

580
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:42,435
(bolt clicks)

581
00:57:44,527 --> 00:57:46,404
Wow.

582
00:57:46,429 --> 00:57:48,033
Not bad.

583
00:57:53,837 --> 00:57:55,817
Can I get you a drink?

584
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:57,546
No, I'm good. Thanks.

585
00:58:00,343 --> 00:58:04,951
Look, it's just your accent,
you being from the States and all...

586
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:07,018
Mmm.

587
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:09,462
I guess you remind me
of home.

588
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:12,296
Mmm, ah.
You miss it?

589
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:15,769
Yeah.
But I had to leave.

590
00:58:15,792 --> 00:58:17,465
Why?

591
00:58:19,195 --> 00:58:21,038
Too many bad memories.

592
00:58:22,131 --> 00:58:25,943
And now sometimes I think
I'm just in this city to hide, you know?

593
00:58:25,969 --> 00:58:27,676
Too scared to go back.

594
00:58:27,704 --> 00:58:29,706
Right. Scared of what?

595
00:58:38,147 --> 00:58:40,058
My dad was murdered.

596
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:47,502
The guy that did it--
they never found him.

597
00:58:48,591 --> 00:58:51,595
He had this mask on.

598
00:58:51,628 --> 00:58:54,131
I saw him, though.
I saw the whole thing.

599
00:58:56,099 --> 00:58:59,205
I was just a little girl,

600
00:58:59,235 --> 00:59:02,114
but, hmm,
I'll never forget.

601
00:59:05,108 --> 00:59:06,985
I'm sorry.

602
00:59:11,014 --> 00:59:12,687
I mean, that's tough.

603
00:59:16,085 --> 00:59:17,996
I don't know why
I'm telling you this.

604
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:30,904
( Phone rings)

605
00:59:30,934 --> 00:59:34,507
I'm sorry.
I have to get this.

606
00:59:37,206 --> 00:59:38,207
Leg?

607
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:40,915
I'm sorry, mate,
but I did you wrong.

608
00:59:41,911 --> 00:59:43,322
What's up?

609
00:59:43,346 --> 00:59:45,986
Things are going to get
pretty tough for us, Ray.

610
00:59:46,015 --> 00:59:47,460
What are you telling me, Leo?

611
00:59:47,483 --> 00:59:49,759
I'm gonna get out of Dodge.

612
00:59:49,786 --> 00:59:52,266
You gotta get out too.
Get outta Prague.

613
00:59:52,288 --> 00:59:55,235
Mikhail clamped the vise.

614
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:56,566
And I gave you up--

615
00:59:57,560 --> 00:59:59,562
your name,
where you're gonna be,

616
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:01,906
where you live.
All of it. I'm sorry, mate.

617
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:05,379
If I didn't, I was history.

618
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:10,774
Sorry.

619
01:00:10,807 --> 01:00:12,718
( Phone beeps )

620
01:00:22,518 --> 01:00:24,361
Hey.

621
01:00:24,387 --> 01:00:26,492
This belonged to my dad.

622
01:00:26,522 --> 01:00:28,058
He took it everywhere.

623
01:00:28,091 --> 01:00:30,503
Why is it here?

624
01:00:31,894 --> 01:00:34,033
Tell me!

625
01:00:34,063 --> 01:00:37,374
There's pictures of me in here.
This is my life.

626
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:38,743
What-- why?

627
01:00:39,836 --> 01:00:42,077
Did you have something to do
with his death?

628
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:46,719
Huh?
Tell me.

629
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:50,791
Tell me. Tell me!

630
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:52,224
Yes.

631
01:00:59,889 --> 01:01:01,232
Why?

632
01:01:01,257 --> 01:01:05,637
Because it was
what I was hired to do.

633
01:01:07,730 --> 01:01:09,732
And now you're here
to kill me?

634
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:13,905
No.
I'm trying to protect you.

635
01:01:14,937 --> 01:01:18,248
Am I supposed to
believe that, really?

636
01:01:21,377 --> 01:01:23,983
(sobbing, muttering )

637
01:01:26,049 --> 01:01:28,655
( door opens, closes )

638
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:46,176
Catch you at a bad time?

639
01:01:48,638 --> 01:01:50,447
I threw you out the window.

640
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:53,615
I bounce real good.

641
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:02,789
And the grenades?

642
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:06,560
I thought it was a nice touch.

643
01:02:15,164 --> 01:02:17,235
Just who the hell
do you think you are?

644
01:02:17,266 --> 01:02:19,007
The bad guy.

645
01:02:22,004 --> 01:02:23,813
That's funny.

646
01:02:25,441 --> 01:02:26,977
I thought I was.

647
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:09,585
(faint club music playing)

648
01:04:13,449 --> 01:04:17,295
We just got back
from the black guy's place.

649
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:20,301
Is it over?
Is he dead?

650
01:04:20,323 --> 01:04:22,303
No, I don't think so.

651
01:04:22,325 --> 01:04:24,236
What happened?

652
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:28,504
The place was a mess.
But no bodies.

653
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:30,738
We thought this might be
interesting to you.

654
01:04:30,766 --> 01:04:32,973
The same girl--
she's in every picture.

655
01:04:48,017 --> 01:04:50,861
And Aleksey?

656
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:53,390
I called him.

657
01:04:53,422 --> 01:04:56,631
He told me to tell you
goodbye.

658
01:05:09,505 --> 01:05:12,042
( Mutters softly )
Shit.

659
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:24,027
Guess what?

660
01:05:27,556 --> 01:05:29,229
Thrill me.

661
01:05:29,258 --> 01:05:32,933
We got an anonymous tip

662
01:05:32,962 --> 01:05:35,499
about Mikhail's new man.

663
01:05:35,531 --> 01:05:39,673
You're right-
it is the Wolf.

664
01:05:45,641 --> 01:05:48,554
He's staying at some
high-end hotel downtown.

665
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:56,230
We end this.

666
01:05:59,822 --> 01:06:02,564
We end this now.

667
01:07:27,376 --> 01:07:29,356
( Keypad beeping )

668
01:07:29,378 --> 01:07:31,688

669
01:07:31,714 --> 01:07:34,194
Recording: Hi, this is Janice.
Please leave a message

670
01:07:34,216 --> 01:07:36,822
and I'll get back to you
as soon as I can. Thanks.

671
01:07:36,852 --> 01:07:37,990
( Beeps )

672
01:07:38,020 --> 01:07:42,264
Hey, Janice, it's me again.
Can you please call me back?

673
01:07:42,291 --> 01:07:45,272
It's just I, uh...

674
01:07:45,294 --> 01:07:47,274
Just call me back.

675
01:07:47,296 --> 01:07:48,798
( Phone beeps off)

676
01:08:27,002 --> 01:08:30,245
- You ready?
- Shit.

677
01:08:30,272 --> 01:08:32,548
I mean yeah.

678
01:08:35,978 --> 01:08:38,219
Shh.

679
01:08:38,247 --> 01:08:40,693
Everyone bleeds.

680
01:08:46,489 --> 01:08:49,698
â™ª The light shines from her eyes â™ª

681
01:08:49,725 --> 01:08:53,036
â™ª Such a pretty sweet surprise â™ª

682
01:08:53,062 --> 01:08:55,440
â™ª When the moon is in the sky... â™ª

683
01:08:55,464 --> 01:08:58,411
( Music continues within )

684

â™ª When spring is in the air â™ª

686
01:09:08,744 --> 01:09:12,624
â™ª Love is foolish... â™ª

687
01:09:14,183 --> 01:09:16,527
Come on.

688
01:09:16,552 --> 01:09:18,998
You know,

689
01:09:19,021 --> 01:09:22,059
some call it a sixth sense,

690
01:09:22,091 --> 01:09:24,594
others intuition

691
01:09:24,627 --> 01:09:26,800
or a gut instinct.

692
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:29,435
But in reality.

693
01:09:29,465 --> 01:09:31,706
It's the little things

694
01:09:31,734 --> 01:09:34,578
like terrible ventilation...

695
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:38,114
Sorry about this.

696
01:09:39,975 --> 01:09:42,922
( Song continues )

697
01:09:47,149 --> 01:09:48,924
â™ª Spring is in the air â™ª

698
01:09:48,951 --> 01:09:52,125
â™ª And you're in love... â™ª

699
01:10:20,983 --> 01:10:22,485
Yah!

700
01:10:22,518 --> 01:10:25,465

(cell phone ringing )

707
01:11:44,199 --> 01:11:45,371
Yeah?

708
01:11:45,401 --> 01:11:47,711
Ray, how the hell are you, mate?

709
01:11:48,937 --> 01:11:50,075
Leg?

710
01:11:50,105 --> 01:11:51,675
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's me.

711
01:11:51,707 --> 01:11:55,120
Why are you calling me
from Janice's phone, Leo?

712
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:57,750
I got down here as soon as I could
just like you asked.

713
01:12:01,717 --> 01:12:03,196
How many waiting for me?

714
01:12:03,218 --> 01:12:04,856
( laughs)
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

715
01:12:04,887 --> 01:12:07,595
She's here right now.
Lovely girl, Ray.

716
01:12:07,623 --> 01:12:10,502
Hey, you should have told me
about her before.

717
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:14,500
We are actually
getting rat-assed together.

718
01:12:14,530 --> 01:12:16,840
Can you get out?

719
01:12:16,865 --> 01:12:19,106
No, no, no, no can do.

720
01:12:19,134 --> 01:12:21,580
She's a bit tied up at the moment,
taking someone's order.

721
01:12:21,603 --> 01:12:24,106
The place
is absolutely jumping, Ray.

722
01:12:24,139 --> 01:12:25,880
I'm on my way.

723
01:12:27,076 --> 01:12:31,218
Hey, we'll tie one off before we get
out of this dump for good, shall we?

724
01:12:31,246 --> 01:12:32,418
Right.

725
01:12:33,615 --> 01:12:35,060
( Beeps off )

726
01:12:35,084 --> 01:12:36,620
Did I overdo it?

727
01:12:36,652 --> 01:12:39,565
Depends on whether or not
he shows.

728
01:12:39,588 --> 01:12:44,367
He'll show, trust me.
You won't be disappointed.

729
01:12:48,063 --> 01:12:50,600
(crowd cheering )

730
01:12:59,708 --> 01:13:01,312
(door creaking )

731
01:13:14,656 --> 01:13:17,068
You've never looked better, Leo.

732
01:13:17,092 --> 01:13:18,503
(chuckling )

733
01:13:18,527 --> 01:13:21,064
It's the one-armed push-ups, Ray.

734
01:13:21,096 --> 01:13:22,769
Where is she?

735
01:13:22,798 --> 01:13:25,938
She's with Mikhail.
Said he was going back to the club.

736
01:13:40,182 --> 01:13:41,855
Sorry, Ray.

737
01:13:41,884 --> 01:13:44,296
Looks like I four-letter-worded you
again, mate.

738
01:13:44,319 --> 01:13:49,291
They say after the second time,
you should give flowers

739
01:13:49,324 --> 01:13:51,804
or a box of candy.

740
01:13:51,827 --> 01:13:53,864
Let's go.

741
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:01,513
I wish I had something
to give you.

742
01:14:06,141 --> 01:14:09,020
Maybe you still can.

743
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:15,387
Thank you, Ray.

744
01:15:14,209 --> 01:15:16,951

and we are not saved."

747
01:15:23,485 --> 01:15:26,432
We all have to pay
for our sins eventually.

748
01:15:26,455 --> 01:15:28,093
That I know.

does she die with you?

You gotta go.

01:22:00,081 --> 01:22:02,721
You gotta get out of Prague.

(dog grunting )

797
01:23:46,187 --> 01:23:49,828
I spent a lot of time
and came a long way

798
01:23:49,858 --> 01:23:52,964
to ask you
one extremely short question.

799
01:23:52,994 --> 01:23:55,031
Why didn't I kill you?

800
01:23:57,766 --> 01:24:00,337
Nobody paid me to kill you.

801
01:24:02,303 --> 01:24:05,716
But the next logical question is...

802
01:24:05,740 --> 01:24:08,550
what the fuck
are you doing in my house?

803
01:24:09,677 --> 01:24:14,183
I never really enjoyed being manipulated
by those underworld assholes,

804
01:24:14,215 --> 01:24:16,286
so then I thought to myself-

805
01:24:16,317 --> 01:24:19,662
"Aleksey, there are a lot of assholes
out there with lots of money.

806
01:24:19,687 --> 01:24:22,827
Instead of earning it from them...

807
01:24:24,592 --> 01:24:27,198
why don't we
just take it from them?"

808
01:24:33,735 --> 01:24:35,737
Why not?

809
01:24:35,770 --> 01:24:37,977
Maybe I'll give you
a call sometime.

810
01:24:39,307 --> 01:24:41,651
That, my friend, you may.

01:24:41,676 --> 01:24:44,816
(distant siren wails)

812
01:24:52,220 --> 01:24:56,635
Ray's voice:
Lamentations 3:26--

813
01:24:56,658 --> 01:24:58,934
"it is good that a man
should both hope and quietly wait

814
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:01,497
for the salvation of the Lord."

815
01:25:03,398 --> 01:25:04,775
No matter where you run,

816
01:25:04,799 --> 01:25:08,008
you always end up
right back where it all started,

817
01:25:08,036 --> 01:25:10,209
back with yourself.

818
01:25:11,739 --> 01:25:15,482
Maybe I'll never know
how I ended up where I have.

819
01:25:15,510 --> 01:25:18,354
I do know that the price
I have to pay

820
01:25:18,379 --> 01:25:21,258
is that I'll never be saved,

821
01:25:21,282 --> 01:25:22,920
but at least she can be.

822
01:25:53,348 --> 01:25:57,228
( Instrumental music playing )

823
01:29:26,961 --> 01:29:31,239
(woman vocalizing )

824
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:35,118
