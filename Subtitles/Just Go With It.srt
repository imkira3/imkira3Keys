1
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,280
I'm so happy you picked this dress, Veruca!

2
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,360
You look beautiful. Doesn't she?

3
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,800
You guys, I'm getting married!

4
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,600
I'm getting married!

5
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,280
Not without your veil, you're not.

6
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,720
Where is that bad boy?

7
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,080
Oh, I think I left it upstairs.

8
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,920
Don't worry. I'll get it,

9
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,680
sis.

10
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,360
She is so annoying.

11
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,040
And so ugly.

12
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,960
She looks like Karl Malden.

13
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,280
I know, and she's gonna be

14
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,360
my sister-in-law in an hour!

15
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,160
How are you gonna deal with that?

16
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,120
I'm just gonna lay down the law for Danny.

17
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,800
We're seeing his goofy family as little as possible.

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,440
You sure he's gonna go along with that?

19
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,640
Danny doesn't say no to me.

20
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,880
Believe me, I have him well-trained.

21
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,200
So, tell us, what happened with Eric last night?

22
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,520
So, I told him if he wanted to stop the wedding,

23
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,160
he had to speak now or forever hold his peace.

24
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,680
And what'd he say?

25
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,240
He said he's never gonna settle down,

26
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,000
and I should just go ahead and marry Danny.

27
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,080
Did he give you a wedding present, huh?

28
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,480
You're so horny! Yeah.

29
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,240
I guess you could call it that.

30
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,680
You're so bad!

31
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,840
It's the last time, I swear.

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,160
Yeah, right!

33
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,680
Danny is so sweet and considerate.

34
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,760
And he's gonna be a cardiologist.

35
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,680
So, I'm marrying him

36
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,680
and that zucchini in the middle of his face.

37
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,320
His parents are disgusting, too!

38
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,320
Close your eyes when he's on top!

39
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,240
And your thighs!

40
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,040
Cuz, I'm so sorry.

41
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,840
Yikes, that hurt.

42
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,800
That was me, Danny Maccabee, 20 years ago.

43
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,960
Pathetic, huh?

44
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,280
So, I'm halfway done boozing away my sorrows,

45
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,040
when something pretty interesting happened.

46
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,280
Oh, baby, you're like a Pop Tart,

47
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,360
hot and sweet!

48
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,560
Hey, mami!

49
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,400
You must play the trumpet or something,

50
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,640
'cause you're making me feel all horny and stuff!

51
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,280
You dropped your purse.

52
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,840
Can I just sit for 10 seconds

53
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,160
and not get hit on? Thank you.

54
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,920
I was just letting you know you dropped your purse.

55
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,240
I'm sorry. I thought... That's fine, that's fine.

56
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,840
I'm sure you didn't meet the
lady who gave you that ring

57
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,720
in a meat market like this.

58
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,440
School cafeteria.

59
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,560
How long you been married?

60
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,480
I was gonna tell her, I really was.

61
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,520
But I didn't want her to know what a loser I was,

62
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,160
so I stretched the truth a little.

63
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,320
Six years.

64
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,160
Where's your wife tonight?

65
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,240
I stopped asking that question a long time ago.

66
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,040
That's terrible.

67
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,800
My wife says I work too much.

68
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:41,320
Trying to provide for her, her shopping addiction,

69
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,800
and crack.

70
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,640
Why don't you just leave her?

71
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,600
The children.

72
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,440
All 14 of them.

73
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,000
I just, I like to adopt,

74
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,440
and I don't wanna stop doing that.

75
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,640
You poor guy.

76
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,800
You wanna get outta here?

77
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,760
And so I discovered

78
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,680
the power of the wedding ring.

79
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,440
The symbol of my humiliation

80
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,960
had become a tool to get back on the horse.

81
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,800
Are you kidding me? Snuffleupagus!

82
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,400
I switched my specialty from
cardiology to plastic surgery,

83
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,320
got rid of the big honker,

84
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,880
and the ring became my thing.

85
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:24,320
I just assumed after we got married
she'd stop hooking, but...

86
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,120
You need to put this wedding band on a true heart.

87
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,720
This is a good moment.

88
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,520
Yeah. Should we go make it last,

89
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,720
for a while, somewhere?

90
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,800
Okay, let's go. To your dorm.

91
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,680
Sometimes I think about

92
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,320
throwing the ring into the ocean.

93
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,880
I know how wrong it is. But I can't.

94
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,080
It's my Precious.

95
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,760
Besides, being fake married

96
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,480
is the perfect way to make sure

97
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,520
I never get my heart broken again.

98
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,360
What are these?

99
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,760
Boobie bags.

100
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,080
The women, they stick them in their flat chesties,

101
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,160
make them big.

102
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,200
These are not the boobie bags that I ordered.

103
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,560
What is that?

104
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,280
It's like a syrup dispenser at an IHOP.

105
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,440
I don't know what that is.

106
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,240
Come on. These, they don't feel like these.

107
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,040
No... Seriously?

108
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,360
I just trying to learn.

109
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,320
Listen, Dr. Maccabee would
never accept subpar boobs.

110
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,200
Would you please just get me what I ordered

111
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,840
and tell Omar that I would like a
discount for the inconvenience?

112
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,880
Yes, ma'am. Thank you, Simon.

113
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,440
My 4:00 here? KATHERINE: Yeah.

114
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,000
Room one, Kirsten Brant. Don't laugh.

115
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,800
Well, I, uh... I had bad plastic surgery.

116
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,920
Should've known this doctor was a quack.

117
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,960
His office was in, like, a warehouse.

118
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,160
I see, I see.

119
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,320
Questions?

120
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,480
No, no. Just, please help me, Doctor.

121
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,880
Absolutely. It's usually easier

122
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,640
to do these things right the first time, but...

123
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,600
What? You seem dubious.

124
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,680
Hmm?

125
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,200
Oh, no, not at all.

126
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,120
I mean, I hear you're the best, Dr. Maccabee.

127
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,000
I don't know about that,

128
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:26,920
but I think we can figure something out here.

129
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,280
Relax, relax.

130
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,400
That's relaxed? Hmm.

131
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,360
Here, let me just pull it down for a sec.

132
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,760
And I let go. Okay, shoots right
back up there.

133
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,680
I'm sorry. Oh. Sorry about what?

134
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,440
Oh, my God! It's just...

135
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,640
That just really went right up there.

136
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,560
That was high. You gotta watch that.

137
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,640
It's gonna get caught in your hair.

138
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,200
I don't know, maybe I should just keep it like this.

139
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,800
It seems to make other people happy.

140
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,320
No. But, seriously, are you available
for my kid's birthday party?

141
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,040
That's too much. I'm sorry!

142
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,160
Let me give you a hug.

143
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,120
That's what you need first. We'll fix this.

144
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,480
Mmm.

145
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,960
Oh, God! Okay, I gotta...

146
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,560
I'm gonna excuse myself. I'm sorry.

147
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,320
Ding-dong!

148
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,200
Eddie's here. Hey. My cousin.

149
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,600
Oh.

150
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,000
Oh, my gosh.

151
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,160
Brows gone wild over here.

152
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,480
I'm actually digging it.

153
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,560
And what are you doing later?

154
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,680
Oh!

155
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:30,080
Oh, sorry, I'm kind of seeing
anybody else. There you go.

156
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,800
Oh, browch.

157
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,080
My gosh.

158
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,640
Look, I don't know who you're seeing,

159
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,040
but whoever they are,

160
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:40,080
they don't have what this guy's got down
there, you know what I mean?

161
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,440
All right, Eddie.

162
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,480
Yeah, it's a very good one. I should know, I installed it.

163
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,080
Oh, you had a penile enlargement?

164
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,440
Yes.

165
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,200
People really do that? That is hilarious!

166
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,880
See you on the 28th, Dr. Maccabee!

167
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,600
Dude, why are you telling everybody
about my surgery?

168
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,480
Am I hiding the secrets around here?

169
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,960
You don't think Katherine knows about this?

170
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,920
Katherine was in the room when I did that.

171
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,560
She held the magnifying glass.

172
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,280
I did. And the tweezer.

173
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,720
Real nice.

174
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,320
Did you get a chance to try it out yet?

175
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,480
Uh, yeah. I've banged it up.

176
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,720
It's got a couple dents. I'm not gonna lie.

177
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,760
Yeah. You did?

178
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,640
Not from a human.

179
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,400
It's got... From this doll I made.

180
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,920
Oh.

181
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,480
Hey, Adon. Yo, yo.

182
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,920
Danny! I am so happy you could be here!

183
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,800
How are you, baby? Did you bring any Botox?

184
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,200
I didn't bring the Botox. I brought my cousin, Eddie.

185
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,840
Nice to meet you, Eddie.

186
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,280
Is this a Halloween party?

187
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,000
Are you kidding me right now?

188
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,280
You got a little more work done, huh?

189
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,360
Yeah, just a little bit, just tweaking, tweaking.

190
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,960
Maintenance, maintenance.

191
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,200
I just wanna stay in the game, Danny.

192
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,800
I don't wanna hit home runs,
just some singles. That's all.

193
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,600
You gotta stop, though, I'm telling you.

194
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,160
Do you have any feeling in your face?

195
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,200
Just in this one spot right here.

196
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,160
And then from the eyebrows down, dead, dead.

197
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,960
Is that a car alarm?

198
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,040
He's laughing, he's laughing. Oh, okay.

199
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,440
I wanted to go to your cousin Danny here,

200
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,000
but he refused to do any work.

201
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,640
He didn't wanna put his fingers in the pie. Ooh!

202
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,200
It was getting dangerous. This amount...

203
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,840
You gotta slow it down.

204
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,800
Okay, see? That shouldn't be happening right now.

205
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,680
Adon! Adon, Adon, Adon!

206
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,240
Ariel cut open his knee. It looks awful.

207
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,400
What happened? Settle, settle.

208
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,680
What do you expect me to do about it?

209
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,840
It's bleeding. You know what? I could stitch him up.

210
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,560
Why don't you go get me my bag? All right.

211
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,800
So, you fell down the stairs, huh?

212
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,160
Yeah.

213
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,320
Mmm-hmm.

214
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,880
Did you trip over something?

215
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,360
Was there a skateboard there, or...

216
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,920
No, I was distracted by something.

217
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,560
What distracted you?

218
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,800
A girl.

219
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,680
A girl, okay. Was it your mother?

220
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,920
No!

221
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,320
'Cause she just looks good.

222
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,760
That's your stepmom. I can talk like that.

223
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,880
All right. This is lidocaine. Don't think about it.

224
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,720
Ow!

225
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,760
Don't think about it. Think about your face.

226
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,920
Good, good.

227
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,520
Blonde, brunette, redhead?

228
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,440
Blonde, tan, tall, rocking body.

229
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,880
Nipples.

230
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,000
Want me to numb something else for you?

231
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,360
You're getting a little nutty over there.

232
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,040
No! No, I'm good. I'm good.

233
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,400
I'm alive! I'm alive, everybody!

234
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,600
Good job, Doctor. That was really nice.

235
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,640
The distraction, I'm guessing.

236
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,800
The what?

237
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,520
The boy was distracted. That's why he fell.

238
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,880
So, I'm taking the rap for this.

239
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,600
Yes. Your hotness basically pushed
him down the stairs.

240
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,400
Good luck proving that in court, Wisengruber.

241
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,200
Wisengruber? Is that what they're saying

242
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,640
on the Gossip Girl nowadays?

243
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,000
I knew you two would eventually find each other!

244
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,880
But be careful, Palmer, these plastic surgeons,

245
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,280
they really know how to operate.

246
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,520
Yeah, all right, Adon. All right.

247
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,360
I just don't know about plastic surgery.

248
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,000
I mean, doesn't it always look so fake?

249
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,320
Depends who's doing it. I'm pretty
good at it. I'm telling you.

250
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,400
Some of my patients are here tonight. Oh, really?

251
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,520
Really, really. Look around,

252
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,000
see if you can find someone decent-looking.

253
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,160
How 'bout her?

254
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,800
The lady from Saw?

255
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,320
Fine. Who did you do?

256
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,440
All right. I hate to rat the guy out,

257
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,360
but see that guy over there?

258
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,360
You mean Sexy Ass?

259
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,000
Before I met him, he was No Buns Bobby.

260
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,200
Really?

261
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,400
His back went straight to his legs. No kidding.

262
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,560
He'd go to the bathroom,

263
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,720
he'd slide right in the toilet.

264
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,320
I know, I know, that's really romantic, isn't it?

265
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,000
So, North Carolina, how long
have you lived here in LA?

266
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,520
I've been here almost two years.

267
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,040
Uh-huh. That's a lot of auditioning for you.

268
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,640
You think I'm an actress?

269
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,040
I guarantee you're an actress.

270
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,880
Well, guess again, Doc. I teach sixth grade math.

271
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,200
They got no schools in North Carolina to teach at?

272
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,680
My parents divorced.

273
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,120
Had a pretty nasty one, actually,

274
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,760
when I was in the eighth grade. Mmm-hmm.

275
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:13,320
And... I don't know. I got tired of picking sides, so...

276
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,840
Okay. I thought I'd make a change
and, yeah, move out to LA.

277
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,680
You came to the right place.
No one gets divorced in LA.

278
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,000
Mmm-hmm.

279
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,720
I've never hung out with a girl your age. This is nice.

280
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,960
Oh, no. Your first lie to me.

281
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,360
You're good. All right.

282
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,720
I've never hung out with a girl your age and

283
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,720
connected the way we are right now.

284
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,040
Actually, I've never connected with,

285
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,080
I don't think any girl at any age.

286
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,160
See? I can tell when you're lying

287
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,280
and when you're telling the truth. Oh.

288
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,120
Yeah. The second thing I said was the truth.

289
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,720
I know.

290
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:09,040
Oh, my God. That was the greatest night of my life.

291
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,280
Yeah. This feels like it could be...

292
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,760
I don't know, a real thing.

293
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,400
It's a thing all right, Palmer.

294
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,360
Well, I have to get to work,

295
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,760
but how 'bout I take your number

296
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,120
and then you can take me out
on a proper date next time?

297
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:30,320
I got a business card in my pocket
if you wanna get that.

298
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,640
You better call.

299
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,840
You better not just, just leave me hanging.

300
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,880
I'd get it for you myself,

301
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,040
but I don't want you to see me naked in the daylight.

302
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,000
It could be a deal breaker.

303
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,320
What's this?

304
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,120
A circle?

305
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,920
A wedding ring? You're married?

306
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,320
No, no, no, I'm not, I'm not married.

307
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,600
That is a... That is... That's not mine.

308
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,000
Whose wedding ring is in your pants, Danny?

309
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,120
All right, listen, just give me a minute to explain this.

310
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,520
Please.

311
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,840
It's gonna take more than a minute.

312
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,360
I am such an idiot!

313
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,640
No, no, no, no, no.

314
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,560
Don't call me!

315
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,280
No, Palmer!

316
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,560
I told you that this whole fake marriage thing

317
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,560
was just gonna come and bite you in the ass.

318
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,400
Why don't you just tell her the truth?

319
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,360
You think I can tell her the truth?

320
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,960
Let me practice. You be her right now.

321
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,840
Oh, good. Okay, hold on.

322
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,240
Okay. She's not like that, but anyways.

323
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:41,240
Um, I wear this fake wedding ring sometimes...

324
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,360
You're a pig.

325
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,360
Sorry. You're a pig.

326
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,480
What's wrong? You're walking really weird.

327
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,800
My back. I slept on the beach last night.

328
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,000
God Almighty.

329
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,920
When are you gonna strengthen your spine?

330
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,720
Seriously, Flomax.

331
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,720
You gotta work out more than once a month.

332
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,320
I can't, I don't have time to work out.

333
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,920
You do. You can't say that, Danny.

334
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,160
My mother always said Cary Grant
never went to the gym.

335
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:07,240
Only took the stairs, every day, never an elevator.

336
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,840
You wanna hear my impression
of Cary Grant's butler? Nuh-uh.

337
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,960
Watch. What?

338
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,360
Hello? No, he's dead.

339
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,120
Okay, bye-bye.

340
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,880
That's good. That's funny.

341
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,240
Mom, give me some money.

342
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,720
Hi. How are you?

343
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,040
Nice to see you, kids.

344
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,080
Please be polite and say hello to Dr. Maccabee.

345
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,600
'Ello, Dr. Danny.

346
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,120
'Ow is you today?

347
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,960
Is that my associate, Dr. Doolittle?

348
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,240
Why is she talking like that?

349
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,400
She's been working on some accents.

350
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,640
I am takin' an acting class this summer, I is.

351
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,360
Gonna be the next Miley Cyrus, I am.

352
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,960
How 'bout you, young man? Do
you like Hannah Montana?

353
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,960
No. I like Californication.

354
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,800
When do you ever watch Californication?

355
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,960
Rosa lets us watch Showtime
when she calls her boyfriend.

356
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,160
Eat the mushroom! Eat the mushroom! Yes!

357
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,880
Mmm. You run a tight ship at home, huh?

358
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,240
Dr. Danny?

359
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,560
Yeah?

360
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,400
Will you take me to Hawaii so
I can swim with the dolphins?

361
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,000
Take you to Hawaii? No.

362
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,680
I saw a show on the Discovery Channel.

363
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,760
They say in Hawaii they have dolphins

364
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,440
that you can swim with if you pay money.

365
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,760
Okay.

366
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,640
But I don't have any money. And
my mom says you're rich.

367
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,640
Michael! No, it's fine.

368
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,840
Maybe you should make your own money.

369
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,000
Maybe a paper route or something like that?

370
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,800
'Cause rich people don't give other people trips.

371
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,920
That's why they remain rich. You understand?

372
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:29,480
But my mom says you do charity for kids all the time.

373
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:34,960
I do charity work like I fix a cleft
lip or a child's deformity.

374
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,080
I don't take them to Hawaii.
I could get arrested for that.

375
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,520
What if I was deformed? Then
would you take me to Hawaii?

376
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,080
If you were deformed, I'd bring you to Hawaii,

377
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,720
but I'd leave you there, 'cause
I wouldn't want to look at you.

378
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,640
Okay. Here's the money, and I want change.

379
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,920
And I wanna hear back

380
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,040
that you actually ate the food that I am paying for.

381
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,480
Mom, before we go, can I make a Devlin?

382
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,200
Sure. Down the hall. Will you please go with him?

383
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,040
We open in five minutes and I am
not having him sit there forever.

384
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,120
Bloody hell right, I will, Mumsy!

385
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,360
All right, Winston Churchill.

386
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,800
He said, "I gotta make a Devlin."

387
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,720
What does that mean? Uh...

388
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,400
It's just a friend of mine who
was in my sorority in college

389
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,920
named Devlin Adams, and...

390
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,320
Well, I wouldn't say friend. I'd say more my nemesis.

391
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,560
Oh, so she was a frenemy? Yes.

392
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,360
You'd probably like her. She's really, really fake.

393
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,520
Ah.

394
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,360
Always had to have the coolest clothes

395
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:28,080
and the hottest boys and, you know...

396
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,320
She bothers you. A lot.

397
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,040
So, one night, I was just having a glass of wine.

398
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,000
A bottle. A bottle.

399
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,280
And, uh...

400
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,520
And I just got so tired of the kids saying things like,

401
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,920
"I gotta take a crap.

402
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,520
"I gotta take a dump."

403
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,800
So, I told them that it was called "making a Devlin,"

404
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,280
and they liked it.

405
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,360
And it stuck.

406
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,840
I always call it making a black pickle.

407
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,680
Making a what? I don't say that.

408
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,600
Out loud? Good. To others. No.

409
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,600
What are we gonna do about my love life, though?

410
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,880
Oh, Danny, I would feel terrible for you if I had any,

411
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,200
even the slightest, investment in you

412
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,760
successfully banging 23-year-olds.

413
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,440
Holy Devlin, you're not listening to me.

414
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,040
This is like not some bull-Devlin fling.

415
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,680
I mean, I'm serious.

416
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,280
This is the real Devlin. I could...

417
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,640
I swear to God, I could see myself
ending up with this girl.

418
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,080
Oh.

419
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,200
You're right. You can't tell her the truth.

420
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,480
High score!

421
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,440
Oh, God. Sorry.

422
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,560
I'm glad someone's doing good.

423
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,880
You know what? You don't wanna get serious,

424
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,160
'cause when you get serious, that leads to marriage,

425
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,800
and then marriage leads to divorce,
and divorce is just...

426
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,960
I mean, look at these poor kids.

427
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,600
You know, their dad was supposed
to pick them up today.

428
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,080
He was a no-show? Again.

429
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,440
But you know what?

430
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,000
At least I got my head together and I divorced him.

431
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,440
Yeah, yeah.

432
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,080
Wait a minute.

433
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,480
You go ahead without me.

434
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,880
Oh, no, no, no.

435
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,360
Palmer, Palmer, Palmer, Palmer, Palmer.

436
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,960
I told you I didn't want to see you.

437
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,760
I just want to explain something to you.

438
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,080
Let me explain something to you.

439
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,440
I do not date married men.

440
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,280
My father cheated on my mom when I was young.

441
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,160
I am not going to be the other woman!

442
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,200
Adulterer! Fornicator!

443
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,480
All right, take it easy, Damien, all right?

444
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,440
Okay, his name is Silas, leave him out of this.

445
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,960
I'll kill you.

446
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,040
What? Anytime!

447
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,960
Listen! I am married.

448
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,400
But it is a horrible marriage.

449
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,200
She doesn't even talk to me anymore.

450
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,960
Danny, that's what all married men say.

451
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,160
If it's so bad, why don't you get divorced?

452
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,560
I am.

453
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,720
You are? Yes! It's over.

454
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,600
Oh, my God, I can't believe this.

455
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,080
I destroyed a marriage!

456
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,360
I really feel like I'm gonna be sick. I can't...

457
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,440
No, no, it wasn't 'cause of you!

458
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,520
I filed a long, long time ago.

459
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,960
We're gonna sign the papers in a couple of days

460
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,120
and it's like, she's dead to me.

461
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,520
What's her name?

462
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,040
Mrs. Maccabee.

463
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:05,360
You mean her first name? Her first name is Devlin.

464
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,600
Her name's Devlin?

465
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,520
Isn't that a shitty name? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

466
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:14,480
But Devlin and I are splitting up, fortunately,

467
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,880
'cause I caught her cheating on me with another guy.

468
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,080
I didn't catch her.

469
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:24,280
The television show Cheaters caught her and the guy.

470
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,640
And I told them not to air it, though,

471
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,880
because it's too painful.

472
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,200
They actually burned the tape so you can't see it.

473
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,920
But I would love you to.

474
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,920
There's another man?

475
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,920
There's another guy, yes. Dolph.

476
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,560
Dolph?

477
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,440
Dolph Lundgren. Yeah.

478
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,120
Like the guy from Rocky IV?

479
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,840
No, no, a different Dolph Lundgren.

480
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,280
Apparently, if you bring that one up,

481
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,800
this one gets really angry, so don't.

482
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,880
Danny, guys always say they're
gonna leave their wives.

483
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,040
They never do.

484
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,280
I'm telling you, she's happy with this Dolph guy,

485
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,520
good for her. Now I wanna be happy.

486
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,880
And the only way I can be happy is if I'm with you!

487
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,040
All right?

488
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,480
Just wanna be able to be with you

489
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,320
and not be called a "fornicator"

490
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,080
or an "adulterer" or whatever that

491
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,920
Children of the Corn kid was calling me.

492
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,640
Okay.

493
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,800
Okay?

494
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,800
I just need to hear it from her.

495
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,240
How about if she texts you, would that be good?

496
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,720
I need to meet her.

497
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,920
Let's do it.

498
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,480
You want me to be
your wife? DANNY: Uh-huh.

499
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,600
And you couldn't think of another
name, other than Devlin?

500
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,280
I practically took a Devlin in my
pants when she asked me.

501
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,480
"What's her name?" I got panicked.

502
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,600
I get nervous around this girl.

503
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,840
You got panicked?

504
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,080
You who invents a fake wife every Friday night?

505
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,360
Yeah. Doesn't that say something

506
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,640
about what I feel about this girl?

507
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,920
Have you ever thought about the time

508
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,840
that she's actually gonna walk
into your office... Uh-huh.

509
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:52,000
...and sees that I'm your assistantlreceptionist?

510
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,840
So easy. I'm a plastic surgeon,

511
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,280
you will never look like you again.

512
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,320
Snip, snap. Chip, chap. What are you talking about?

513
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,000
I'm kidding. I'll get you a fake mustache.

514
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,040
Oh, my God, you've really, really
not thought this through.

515
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,000
Will you please just look at some clothes?

516
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,840
Look at that. I don't wear...

517
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,320
I have clothes, by the way.

518
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,720
I do not need to do any of this. I'm fine.

519
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,600
Yes. You have the best clothes that Old Navy sells.

520
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,680
I'm just saying you gotta look
like a plastic surgeon's wife.

521
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,160
I want to create the illusion I had a hot first wife.

522
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,640
You're so... Not this!

523
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,360
Okay, come on, let's go, you asked for it.

524
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,480
I'm ready.

525
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,960
Wow! These are... Oh, geez.

526
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,080
Nice, nice.

527
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:31,200
It's just been a while since I've been in heels, sorry.

528
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,320
Okay, okay. Oh, gosh. Okay.

529
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,200
Get there. Yeah, great.

530
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,720
Oh, my God! These are gorgeous!

531
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,040
How much are these? $1,700.

532
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,800
$1,700? What, do you come with them?

533
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:48,000
My parents' house costs $1,700. No, no.

534
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,840
No. What, did Mickey Mantle sign those?

535
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,040
Why are they $1,700, they made outta panda?

536
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,520
Walk away. Yeah. You know what?

537
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,400
We won't really be needing them anyway.

538
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,360
'Cause I'm actually starting to...

539
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:02,000
I'm actually starting to feel not
so hot. Is it warm in here?

540
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,440
Whoo. I'm not sure I'll be able to make it this evening.

541
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:08,160
Very good. Okay, you know what? We'll take them.

542
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,440
It's your Christmas bonus. Oh, really?

543
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,280
Okay, then I would like them in blue, too.

544
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,040
In case a heel breaks or I just want to cuddle.

545
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,080
It's beautiful. You sicken me.

546
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,120
Yes, well, that's why we're getting a divorce.

547
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,360
We're getting a divorce because you're
greedy, schemy and selfish.

548
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,760
Actually, I think you need to
get the matching bag, too.

549
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,720
Yeah, I think I should.

550
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,600
Mmm. Thank you, Laurie. I agree.

551
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,600
All the girls are sticking together. Isn't that sweet?

552
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,240
Mmm-hmm. She's on your side, what a shock.

553
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,120
You asked for this. Trust me.

554
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,360
Uh-huh. You asked for this.

555
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,040
No.

556
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,880
No.

557
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,720
Hell, no! No, no, no!

558
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,920
What do you mean, no?

559
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,480
No? No what?

560
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,760
No hope. Okay? There's only one word for it.

561
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,120
What is it? Neglect.

562
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,240
Okay? This is the one word

563
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,680
for the whole thing. Are you the husband?

564
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:35,120
I'm the soon to be ex-husband.

565
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,440
We're getting a divorce.

566
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,880
Well, you know he's not divorcing you.

567
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,120
He's divorcing your head.

568
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,120
True 'dat, Ernesto. Right on the money.

569
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,640
Your hair is so messed up, I don't even...

570
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,800
Let me count the ways.

571
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,920
It's dull, it's dead, it's flat.

572
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,240
Don't forget smelly.

573
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,680
It don't smell, particularly...

574
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,200
Okay, I think we got it. You bad.

575
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,600
You is bad. Give me a little bit. That's bad, though.

576
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:57,720
You guys, come on, seriously.
Ernesto, can you just, please

577
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,480
do something, so we can be home

578
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,560
and I can get out of here?

579
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,720
Hurricane Katrina could do something, baby.

580
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,040
I'm gonna do something transcendent.

581
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,320
Katya! Yuri, Mrs. Hwiggins!

582
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,600
We going in deep, y'all.

583
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,040
You seem nervous, Danny.

584
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,320
No, no, I just...

585
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,240
It's weird, she gets me very tense.

586
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,840
I'm sorry to put you through this.

587
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,400
No, I understand why we're doing this.

588
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,520
I'm just looking forward to getting
past this part of my life

589
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,400
and moving on to the good part.

590
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,000
We will. Soon. Tonight.

591
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,520
Good God, yes.

592
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,520
Is that her?

593
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,520
I think so.

594
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,080
She's stunning.

595
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,760
I love her shoes.

596
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,160
Yeah, well, she got about five pairs of them.

597
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,400
Maybe she'll give you one.

598
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,320
Henderson!

599
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,560
Do you see Dr. Maccabee anywhere in this...

600
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,840
Oh! There he is.

601
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,560
Keep the car running, shan't be long.

602
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,760
Hello, boring!

603
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,560
Hey. You went with a limo driver?

604
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,240
I'm just playing the part.

605
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,720
Okay.

606
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,440
Palmer! Hi.

607
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,280
Devlin Maccabee. Soon to be, single-abee.

608
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:27,120
Waiter! Excuse me. Anybody?

609
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,560
Yes, yes. Something to drink, madam?

610
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,040
Well, hello.

611
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,120
I would like a tall glass of you.

612
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,120
Is that possible? Meow!

613
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,800
I'm just kidding. Unless you're really into it.

614
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,200
Kidding again. No, I'm not.

615
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,560
We don't know. Grey Goose martinis,

616
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,960
just keep 'em coming. Okay. Ooh!

617
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,920
Make that a dirty martini. Okay?

618
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,160
Okay, that was a good one.

619
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,840
Well, so, Palmer.

620
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,360
I heard you and Danny had sex.

621
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:03,000
Yes. I am so sorry, I had...

622
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,640
Please, honey, it is fine.

623
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:09,320
I'm just happy to hear that his thing-a-ding
can still ring-a-ding.

624
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,840
'Cause he's got a serious small issue

625
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,720
with ED. Over here.

626
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,920
Okay.

627
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,480
What's ED? I don't...

628
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,680
Oh, gosh. I forgot. You're fifteen.

629
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:25,840
Erectile dysfunction, my darling.

630
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,240
Think about it as if

631
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:30,040
you're trying to throw darts and you just...

632
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,080
All you really got, you're shooting with,

633
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,640
like, overcooked spaghetti.

634
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,840
Okay. Yeah.

635
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,520
I just think that my spaghetti wasn't loving

636
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,200
the meatballs that was being served.

637
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,920
They were a little too lumpy. Oh.

638
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,600
I've heard from a lot of men that I serve

639
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,720
the finest meatballs in Southern California.

640
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,880
Of course. A lot of homeless men have said this.

641
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,440
They'll eat anything, you know.

642
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,880
I'm just very shocked that you remember

643
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,560
anybody you've ever been with.

644
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,880
With all the pills that are in your system.

645
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,880
She likes the pills, this one.

646
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,640
At night I come home, "What's for dinner?"

647
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,240
"Well, we have purple pills, and the green ones

648
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,880
"and some lovely yellow bombers

649
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,680
"I just took out of the oven."

650
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,920
Remember that?

651
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,600
I had to do something to amuse myself

652
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:21,080
while this one sat on the throne for hours

653
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,240
dealing with his irritable bowel syndrome.

654
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,280
I got another disease. Okay.

655
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:29,240
Can I tell you, I spent the eve of our wedding

656
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,720
sitting on the bed,

657
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:35,400
listening to what sounded like
an underwater symphony,

658
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,640
of French horns and bassoons

659
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,440
coming out of our hotel bathroom.

660
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:44,480
Mix that with the smell of like
a dead cat and some fajitas

661
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,720
and you've got what you call yourself

662
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,720
a severely diminished libido.

663
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,160
Ow!

664
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,600
Did you just kick me?

665
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,920
No. Did you? You kicked her?

666
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,040
Why'd you kick her?

667
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,600
Yeah, I don't... I... Yes. I... I have leg spasms.

668
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,800
Ow!

669
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,120
It's a side effect.

670
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,000
Terrible side effect from all the pill popping.

671
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,080
But, you know, it's all better now.

672
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,240
I'm clean and sober and I apologize.

673
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,400
It's okay.

674
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,640
Thirteenth step, right there. Back to drinking.

675
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,040
Oh, Henderson, you thoughtless oaf,

676
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,520
stop texting, open that door.

677
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,960
Why do you keep calling me
Henderson? Just go with it.

678
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,560
Palmer, so lovely to meet you.

679
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,560
Likewise, really.

680
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,440
I mean, look at you two.

681
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,400
I mean, it's like, Barbie and...

682
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,520
Yes.

683
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,400
...Grandpa Ken.

684
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:39,200
I mean... And even though it did not work out

685
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,960
between us at all...

686
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,440
It's like it never happened. You know?

687
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,680
It really isn't.

688
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,160
I still want my Danny to be happy. Oh, look at that.

689
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,440
Happy, happy, happy.

690
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,680
Good night, kiddo. Okay.

691
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,160
Hello.

692
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,600
It's her drug dealer I'm thinking.

693
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,480
Okay, please put her on the phone right now.

694
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,520
Are you kidding me, honey?

695
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,240
You know how I feel about

696
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,200
you selling your brother's stuff on eBay.

697
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,320
Hey, hey, hey. Take that in the car.

698
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,520
No. It's okay.

699
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:11,360
I will deal with you when I get
home, young lady. Okay.

700
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,800
I mean, you would think...

701
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,280
You have kids?

702
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,600
Hmm? Hmm?

703
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,640
You have... You have children?

704
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:26,080
We have sort of a little bit...

705
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,160
A little bit of children, right?

706
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,760
When were you planning on telling me

707
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,960
about these children, Danny?

708
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,320
I don't know, but listen,

709
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:35,640
I have to go get to those little munchkins.

710
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,720
Palmer, so nice, seriously.

711
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,840
Danny.

712
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,480
No, no, no, hey, hey.

713
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,040
Okay.

714
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,040
Are you freaked out right now about all this or...

715
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,480
Actually, just the opposite.

716
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,480
The opposite of freaked out?
What do you mean? Good?

717
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,880
You know that I love kids.

718
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

719
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,080
I just never pegged you as a kids guy.

720
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,920
I'm a huge kids guy. I love kids.

721
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,680
Kids, kids, kids. Is...

722
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's my thing.
That's my bumper sticker.

723
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,200
What are their names?

724
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:12,360
What are their names again? There is

725
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,200
the girl who, of course, is Kiki Dee.

726
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,840
And then the boy's name's Bart.

727
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,360
Which of course is short for Barto.

728
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,840
Well, I wanna meet them!

729
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,680
Of course you do.

730
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,080
So our mom doesn't
know that you took us today?

731
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,400
Not yet.

732
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,080
You know this is kidnapping.

733
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,360
Stranger danger.

734
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,720
What? No.

735
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,440
Is the guy from Dateline NBC gonna walk in?

736
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:42,920
No! I know you two a long time and Rosa's here.

737
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,160
Doing whatever that Rosa does.

738
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,480
God, she's freaky. DANNY: Yeah.

739
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,600
So here's the deal.

740
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:54,600
How would you like to be my pretend children

741
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,000
for one afternoon?

742
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,080
Why don't you just tell that poor girl the truth?

743
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,240
You know?

744
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,960
Our mother tells us everything.

745
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,400
Wedding ring boy.

746
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,640
What? Oh, my goodness!

747
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,640
Did you see Gossip Girl last night? It was so good!

748
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,600
No, she's not like that.

749
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,920
Your mother's presenting her in a weird, weird way.

750
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,080
I'm just saying, telling the truth

751
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,640
is not in the cards right now.

752
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:17,160
I thought you'd be excited to have an acting job.

753
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,480
If it's an acting job, we should get paid.

754
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,000
Yeah, you're gonna get paid in experience.

755
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,960
I wanna actually get paid.

756
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,400
All right, what do you want?

757
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,440
$600 for the day,

758
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,920
plus overtime if we go over eight hours.

759
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,520
I'll do my own hair and makeup.

760
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,640
And I want you to pay for the six-week
intensive acting camp

761
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,040
that my mom can't afford.

762
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:42,040
$50 for the day and a two-week acting
class at the YMCA nearest you.

763
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,640
$500 and a four- week acting class.

764
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,160
$300 and a three-week class.

765
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,520
Done.

766
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,920
I would have done it for $500.

767
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,040
I would have done it for the experience.

768
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,120
Michael, you're up. Opener?

769
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,000
I want you to take me to Hawaii

770
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,040
so I can swim with the dolphins.

771
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,880
You're not gonna let that one go, are you?

772
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,120
We're not going to Hawaii, pal. Anything else?

773
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,240
Find someone else then.

774
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:19,240
Ooh, the Mafia stare down. Very good, Michael.

775
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,680
We're here to negotiate.

776
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,560
Do you have anything else you might like?

777
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,600
I want a flying pony.

778
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:27,160
I want a flying pony too, Michael, but they don't exist.

779
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,920
Then I want a regular pony. And
I want to name him Nelson.

780
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:34,040
How about a Playstation 3 and we name him Nelson?

781
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,920
Keep talking.

782
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,040
We'll include four video games.

783
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,200
Five games.

784
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:42,920
And I want the meeting with blondie
to be at J.D. McFunnigan's.

785
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,200
How 'bout Charlie Choo-Choo's

786
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,440
'cause it's right down the street from me.

787
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:48,360
Mention that slop-hole again and I walk.

788
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,880
All right, take it easy, son. Take it easy.

789
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,160
And I want unlimited tokens.

790
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,720
If I can spend 'em, I wanna have 'em.

791
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,520
I don't wanna be like playing Skee-Ball

792
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,280
and all of a sudden run out of tokens.

793
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:02,000
All right, I can make that happen.

794
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,600
So do we have a deal?

795
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,840
Deal.

796
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,480
Deal's off unless you eat that pizza, though. Seriously.

797
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,320
Can I do an accent?

798
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,960
Let me hear some. 'Ello!

799
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,560
No. Okay.

800
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,600
My kids? Have you completely lost your mind?

801
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,400
Are you kidding me right now?

802
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,160
You're the one who picked up your cell phone.

803
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,640
That is not...

804
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,960
Mrs. Harrington...

805
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,080
The doctor will see you now.

806
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,000
I can't believe you're doing all of
this just so you can get some.

807
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,840
It's just gross. You're just pathetic.

808
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,280
I'm not trying to get some. I already got some.

809
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,200
And yes, I'd like to continue getting some.

810
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,800
I'm pro me getting some.

811
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,080
Have a seat right there, Mrs. Harrington.

812
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,880
Remove your shirt, if you could.

813
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:50,520
I smell something. You smell something?

814
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,920
I smell perfume.

815
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:55,960
Is that coming from you?

816
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,120
Maybe.

817
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,960
What, you got a date or something?

818
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,800
I don't have a date. I have a lunch.

819
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,120
You got a lunch? Who you got a lunch with?

820
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,520
Dr. Gervitz's office manager,
if you must know everything.

821
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,640
His name is Brian.

822
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,520
The guy with the gray soul patch?

823
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:13,960
You know what?

824
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,480
Hey, man, I'm Brian.

825
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,560
You're mean!

826
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,880
Wow, you wanna go to lunch sometime?

827
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,040
Is he gonna take you there right after the big protest?

828
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,520
Hey, man, we gotta stop these squirrels.

829
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,360
He plays bass, don't he?

830
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,360
You can take the brassiere off, too.

831
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,800
And by the way, he does play the bass.

832
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,680
And he writes songs.

833
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,960
What does he write songs about,

834
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,320
how bad his ponytail stinks?

835
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:40,160
Mrs. Harrington, could you put your
hands on your hips, please?

836
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,160
Okay, so, one of the funbags
is not having too much fun.

837
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,680
All right, what happened anyways?

838
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:47,560
Well, I hit it with the car door yesterday... Right.

839
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,720
...and I heard a pop

840
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,880
and then some sloshing sound when I walk.

841
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,360
Yeah. I think.

842
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,240
What are you doing?

843
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:02,200
Could be the kids or could be Brian.

844
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,520
Okay. Stop that.

845
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,680
Do you mind just for one second?

846
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,840
Let me just talk to this guy.

847
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,400
Stop!

848
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,920
Yeah.

849
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,240
Hello? Yeah, man!

850
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,240
Brian? You can lie down.

851
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,920
Yeah, hi! We sure are.

852
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,680
Yeah, no, sushi would be groovy.

853
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,400
Okay, I'll see you at 1 :00 in the lobby.

854
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,920
Okay, bye.

855
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,520
What voice was that?

856
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:29,960
That was my voice.

857
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,400
Really?

858
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,520
I didn't sound like that.

859
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,760
One o'clock...

860
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,040
You're excited about this guy, huh?

861
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,960
Mrs. Harrington, this is numbing
cream for your nipples, okay?

862
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,240
Oh. Oh, okay.

863
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,960
It's gonna be one afternoon.

864
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,440
Why are we making such a big deal out of this?

865
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,720
Because you know what? You're
trying to get my kids involved

866
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:52,120
in your dysfunctional, sick little,
pathetic, twisted web of lies.

867
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,920
When I was negotiating with your son, Michael,

868
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,920
he had the biggest smile I've
ever seen on anyone's face.

869
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,720
When I told him we could do it at J.D. McFunnigan's,

870
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,160
the kid looked like he won the Heisman Trophy,

871
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,720
I'm not kidding you.

872
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,360
I think that's enough. Do you feel that?

873
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,480
No.

874
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,600
No, but do you feel that?

875
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,760
No. We're good.

876
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,960
By the way, did you make this?

877
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,160
Mmm-hmm.

878
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,000
We'll have to give it to the Smithsonian

879
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,160
when we've done the operation. Terrific job.

880
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,000
Did he really smile?

881
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,000
Swear to God, like the cutest little smile.

882
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,440
And I got Maggie to eat.

883
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,320
You did? Yeah.

884
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,440
Pizza. Deep dish. Three pieces.

885
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,080
I can't get her to eat anything.

886
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:31,040
I know you can't. Don't do this for me.

887
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,680
Do it for the children.

888
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,200
Yeah! Oh, stop!

889
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,720
Come on, you're late!

890
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,200
What are you, in character right away?

891
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,520
Come on, let's go!

892
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,360
She's inside.

893
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,640
What is that?

894
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,200
What?

895
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,000
Did Victoria Beckham have a yard
sale? Why are you wearing that?

896
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,560
Are you kidding me?

897
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,960
This is what you bought for me.

898
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,600
I know, I know. I'm just saying is it...

899
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,800
All right, we're stuck with it,

900
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,040
I just think it's a little over the top, but...

901
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,040
Thanks. Happy to be here to help you.

902
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:05,000
The first rule of improv is always
accept the information.

903
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,040
If someone says something, just go with it.

904
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,240
No negating.

905
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,120
Gotcha. That sounds good, that's smart.

906
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,680
In my acting class, when someone
says "No" in a scene,

907
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,200
the whole class yells, "Die!"

908
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,200
No. I mean, no one will say "no" then.

909
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,360
Don't yell "die."

910
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,880
Who's up for some warm-up exercises?

911
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,800
No, honey, I'm not gonna do that. The what?

912
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,400
The tip of the tongue, the teeth, the lips.

913
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,200
The tip of the tongue, the teeth, the lips.

914
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,200
I got one for you. Shut up!

915
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,720
All right, let's go already. Are you ready there, Mafia?

916
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,760
Hell, yeah. Let's do it!

917
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,800
Stinks.

918
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:23,840
Smells like kids' feet and like skidmark underwear.

919
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,800
Mmm. Happy Father's Day.

920
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,560
Oh! Jeez!

921
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:34,960
Mommy! That man put his pee-pee on my face!

922
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,240
What?

923
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:40,560
He put his face on my pee-pee. Danny!

924
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,840
I'm saying he's the one. I don't think it matters.

925
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,040
No, I get you.

926
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,960
Oh, oh! Palmer, darling.

927
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,240
Hi.

928
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,480
Devlin. Thank you so much for bringing the kids today.

929
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,440
I don't think she was the only one who brought them.

930
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:56,000
You know what I'm saying? They are my pride and joy.

931
00:39:56,120 --> 00:40:00,160
So I'd like to introduce you to, the one and only,

932
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:04,120
Kiki Dee, who came out at nine pounds four ounces.

933
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,240
Yeouch.

934
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,360
And then the whopper, we call him, Bart,

935
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,360
because he was a 1 2-pounder and did some damage.

936
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,000
Okay. So...

937
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,160
Hi, you guys.

938
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,480
Hello, Palmer.

939
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,080
Heard so much about you.

940
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,160
You're British?

941
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:23,960
So you're the bird what's been given
Daddy the ol' slap and tickle?

942
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:30,000
We sent her to boarding school last year in England.

943
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,880
See? So she picked up a slight accent.

944
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,960
It's, you know, very Madonna.

945
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,600
Well, it is a pleasure meeting you, Kiki Dee.

946
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,680
Wish I could say the same.

947
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:43,240
You see, before you, I had meself a father.

948
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,240
I was the apple of his eye.

949
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,840
It was all giggling and chasing butterflies

950
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,720
in the meadows, and what have you.

951
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,560
And now what do I got?

952
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,520
An hour and a half every other week

953
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:58,080
at J.D. McFunnigan's with him and his whore.

954
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,320
Koko! Kiki! Kiki!

955
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,040
God, she's in such pain.

956
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,880
No, that's the pills that...

957
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,160
She took some out of her mother's bureau.

958
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,320
Are you...

959
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,960
All right, let me go see her.

960
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,680
How are you doing, sweetie?

961
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:18,040
I'll be better when I start seeing some tokens.

962
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,680
He's American.

963
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:25,080
Excuse me. Yo! What was that all about?

964
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,200
That was raw and real and in the moment.

965
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,600
You know, I feel very good about it.

966
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,320
You do? Well, I don't!

967
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:34,120
So if you wanna get your money
and your acting classes,

968
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,000
you better start doing things right from now on.

969
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,560
No more sob stories.

970
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,840
And we're stuck with the English accent now, Ringo,

971
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,880
so commit to it. Don't choke, got it?

972
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,040
Got it.

973
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:46,120
Now hug me and laugh

974
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,040
and let's get back into the show.

975
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,760
Okay. Papa!

976
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,560
You're not a whore, Palmer.

977
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,720
Okay.

978
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,560
That's so nice. See what they do, they fight,

979
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,880
then they make up and it's good.

980
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,320
Good. We're doing good.

981
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:04,120
Are you kidding me?

982
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:08,400
Got a hamburger here for Bart, Art the Water Fart.

983
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,520
Here you go, kid.

984
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,800
Look at that, sweet!

985
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:15,280
And two quesadillas for Kiki Sneaky
With a Side of Freaky.

986
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,600
Here's the waters. No soda for you.

987
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:21,240
You're battling diabetes, remember? Huh?

988
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,640
Kiki Dee?

989
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:27,600
I got you two quesadillas 'cause it's your
favorite food so you have to eat it.

990
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:33,320
Well, yes! And that's why I'm going
to eat every single bit of it.

991
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,240
All right, let's see.

992
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,120
Yummy!

993
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,320
Thank you.

994
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,320
Hey, I think we forgot napkins.

995
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,480
We did? Okay. Well let me get the napkins.

996
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,160
Because I know she's not gonna get up and do it

997
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,760
because she doesn't like to get up and do anything.

998
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,000
Oh, nice.

999
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,640
Everybody be cool.

1000
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:56,360
So, Bart, your dad tells me you
like to go to the bathroom.

1001
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,360
When I feel it, I do it.

1002
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,840
What else do you like?

1003
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,440
I don't know.

1004
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,120
That's our Bart.

1005
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,160
He's a man of very few words.

1006
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,240
Ah. Okay.

1007
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,320
Maybe I'm upset.

1008
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,000
Upset about me and your father dating?

1009
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:19,760
No. You seem to make my dad
happy and that's cool, but...

1010
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:21,720
But what?

1011
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,120
Nothing.

1012
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,280
Hey, I want you to feel comfortable

1013
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,520
telling me anything.

1014
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,960
Well, I just hate that he broke his promise to me.

1015
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,200
What promise?

1016
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,560
Yeah, what promise?

1017
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:35,560
He promised me last year that
he would take me to Hawaii

1018
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:36,680
to swim with the dolphins.

1019
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:39,200
They have this lagoon there with dolphins

1020
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,680
and people get to swim with them.

1021
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:41,840
What are you doing?

1022
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,640
But without warning, my dad canceled the trip.

1023
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,360
Why would he do that?

1024
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,480
He met you.

1025
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:50,960
He what?

1026
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,960
No! Die!

1027
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:56,160
No, no, no, no, no, no! I'm saying that did not...

1028
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,560
You misread what I said.

1029
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,520
I said we have to go to Hawaii earlier.

1030
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:04,840
Because I'm excited for all of us to hang out there.

1031
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,000
We're going to Hawaii!

1032
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,840
I can't believe I let a six-year-old blackmail me.

1033
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,280
I saw my shot and I took it.

1034
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:22,600
You're angry at yourself

1035
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,240
'cause you got us into this whole situation.

1036
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:25,560
I did? You really did.

1037
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,400
I think old Mary Poppins with the,

1038
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:30,080
"You can't say no. You can't say no, Guv'nor."

1039
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,000
Okay, listen, my tolerance

1040
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:34,280
for these continued shenanigans is right here.

1041
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,760
And if it gets up to here, I'm taking my kids,

1042
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,680
I'm selling you out and I'm going home.

1043
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:42,440
I am so happy we are doing this, Danny.

1044
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:44,120
Are you kidding me? We're going to Hawaii,

1045
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,760
we're gonna swim with dolphins.

1046
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:47,520
It's gonna be so much fun. I was just telling the squirt.

1047
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,080
And Seventeen magazine.

1048
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,920
You brought that for these guys or is that for you?

1049
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,520
It's mine. It's my favorite.

1050
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,440
See that? Did you ever read that magazine?

1051
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:55,720
Thirty years ago you did.

1052
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,440
And hopefully we're gonna have
time together, right, sweetie?

1053
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:01,400
Wait! Wait!

1054
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,960
Danny, wait!

1055
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:13,120
Muffinstein, I could not stand to be without you.

1056
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,400
Uh-oh!

1057
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,520
Is this him?

1058
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:18,160
I see the Colonel von Generous
right here in front of me.

1059
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:19,840
Okay, I'm confused right now.

1060
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:22,120
I'm so sorry. I've not introduced myself,

1061
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:25,640
we have talked on the phone,
but I am the Dolph Lundgren.

1062
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:29,160
Devlin's man-friendl love monkey.

1063
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:30,400
Oh, kill me now.

1064
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,400
Devlin said you had to stay back and work.

1065
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,000
I did. She what said?

1066
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,520
Nein, nein to the work.

1067
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:38,320
I will work when I am kaput.

1068
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,000
You know, I think this is so great

1069
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:41,600
of all of you, so mature.

1070
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:43,680
I would have loved if my parents
had done something like this

1071
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,160
when they got divorced.

1072
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,480
That's why I was thinking we
should have the man come.

1073
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:49,200
Yeah, I'm glad. I'm glad.

1074
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,200
It's important for the children

1075
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,360
to see us as a unit.

1076
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:55,400
And also I cannot stay away from this potato pancake.

1077
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:58,160
She loves the schnitzel, you know what I mean?

1078
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:03,760
You know what? Tongue feels a little dry.

1079
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:06,200
Let's go get you some water, honey. We'll be back.

1080
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:07,800
That's a big tongue, big tongue.

1081
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:10,240
Get over here, get over here. Ew!

1082
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:11,360
What are you doing here?

1083
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,600
I don't know, saving the day. Helping. Hello?

1084
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,520
Who are you talking to? What are you looking at?

1085
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:17,440
I can't see in these things.

1086
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:18,600
This is what you're gonna do.

1087
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:21,440
You're gonna tell them that you ate a
bad sauerkraut omelet for breakfast

1088
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,840
and that you are feeling like you're
sick and that you gotta go.

1089
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,600
Katherine, I can't go. Okay? Why?

1090
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:29,320
Because I texted a picture of my new
equipment to my ex-girlfriend.

1091
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,440
Oh, you're disgusting.

1092
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,320
And I forgot she's engaged to a UFC fighter.

1093
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,240
He wants to punch me in the face.

1094
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,920
I wanna punch you in the face.

1095
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,120
Hey, guys, how we doing?

1096
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:41,880
I am just waiting for the money for the ticket.

1097
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:44,280
Mmm-hmm. So you are coming? And I am paying?

1098
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,680
Yes. Dolph has zero dollars.

1099
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:47,800
Whoops! Okay.

1100
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,480
Let me see if I can find my credit card.

1101
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:51,600
Oh, here it is.

1102
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,680
That's for sleeping with my wife, pal.

1103
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,600
There you go. Thank you.

1104
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:11,880
Hey, hey!

1105
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:13,680
Didn't have time to make any reservations,

1106
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,040
but I need two rooms, please.

1107
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:16,280
Oh, of course.

1108
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:18,240
Unfortunately, we only have our suites left.

1109
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:19,560
Oh, boy.

1110
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:22,200
The Waldorf Astoria at $8,000 per night

1111
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,160
and the Presidential at $12,000.

1112
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:25,840
$12,000 a night? Mmm-hmm.

1113
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,800
Do the Rolling Stones come and
play for me while I'm in there?

1114
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:29,680
What the hell are you talking
about? Why is it so much?

1115
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:30,840
Is it made out of panda?

1116
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,280
I've used that somewhere else, but is it?

1117
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:35,160
No, but you've made some terrific suggestions

1118
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:36,560
and I'm gonna jot them down.

1119
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,920
Are you a member of the Hilton
Honors Rewards program?

1120
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,000
No, I'm not.

1121
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,280
Oh. That's too bad. You should join.

1122
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:43,560
Yeah.

1123
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,360
Yay!

1124
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:49,520
Just got reamed. I mean, I got the rooms.

1125
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:51,280
Who wants to go to the beach?

1126
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:52,640
Me!

1127
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,120
Who wants to start drinking?

1128
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:56,000
Me!

1129
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:13,600
Okay, yeah,

1130
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:16,520
I would create a fake family for that. Oh, my God!

1131
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,280
You know what? You're disgusting.

1132
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:20,400
Mumsy, please do come in.

1133
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:22,880
The water's as lovely as Westminster in May.

1134
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,240
No, honey, I'm good.

1135
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:25,720
I don't really feel like swimming right now.

1136
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:28,160
What is this from, my Liebchen?

1137
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,800
Don't you be intimidated by
her whole thing right there,

1138
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,160
which is perfect.

1139
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,440
Oh, come on. Like she's intimidated.

1140
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,560
I hope when I'm her age I look that good.

1141
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:37,720
Yes, right?

1142
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,480
You can look that good

1143
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,880
if you don't take the elevators

1144
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,920
and only take the stairs like Cary Grant.

1145
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:49,400
Take the stairs. Take the stairs.

1146
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,360
Hey, why are we stopped here?

1147
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:53,600
Uh, what's the matter?

1148
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,040
I can't look at engagement rings?

1149
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,040
Engagement rings? Yeah, you heard me.

1150
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:59,760
Look all you want, but you and I both know that

1151
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,000
you're gonna get sick of this hottie

1152
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,840
and you're gonna be back on the prowl next week.

1153
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,760
Nope. I'm telling you, is this girl not cute?

1154
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:06,040
Yeah, she's really cute.

1155
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:07,200
Is she not the sweetest?

1156
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,360
The nicest person I've ever met.

1157
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:09,920
Did you ever see her lips?

1158
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,440
I think she has the best lips I've ever seen.

1159
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,760
They're like an inner tube and I just wanna sit on it.

1160
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,240
You know what I mean? And just, like...

1161
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,080
Do you want me to knock you out, or...

1162
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:20,080
No, I'm saying you should sit on her lips.

1163
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:21,400
Anyways...

1164
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:24,200
You know, this whole situation reminds me of a song.

1165
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:27,120
Danny is a big plastic surgeon

1166
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,760
Who never had time for a wife

1167
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:33,200
And he's friends with Davy Who's still in the Navy

1168
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:35,080
Piano Man? Why Piano Man?

1169
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:36,520
No, it's "Piano Dan."

1170
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:38,240
That's based on your life. It's a little Eddie remix.

1171
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:39,480
Uh-huh.

1172
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:43,800
Eddie used to have an afro And
pimples all over his face

1173
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:47,200
So he popped and he poked 'em
And Clearasil soaked 'em

1174
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,320
But ladies still greet him with mace

1175
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:52,800
I was maced one time.

1176
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,520
Five times.

1177
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:01,080
So, guys, we're here to get to know each other better.

1178
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:02,240
Yes. Yeah.

1179
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:03,800
Dolph, let's start with you.

1180
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,640
So, what line of work are you in?

1181
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:09,600
Well, Palmer, I am in sheep.

1182
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:12,760
I'm sorry. I don't know what you mean.

1183
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:16,400
I am a sheep shipper.

1184
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:17,920
Oh. Yes.

1185
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,160
You know, people, they don't buy the sheep

1186
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:21,800
from the local sheepherder anymore.

1187
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:23,840
Really? They don't?

1188
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,480
No, they don't. They go online!

1189
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,440
Yes! They go on the Interweb,

1190
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:33,920
to my website, gotprettysheep.com.

1191
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,560
And leave this, please. Thank you.

1192
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,840
Now, people go on. They see the pictures of the sheep,

1193
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:39,360
and they pick the ones they want.

1194
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:40,800
You know, it's like, "I want that one.

1195
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:43,080
"You know, it's very stylish. You
know, it's a stylish one."

1196
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:45,640
Goes, "Oh, no, I want the shy
one who doesn't want to baa."

1197
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:47,360
Or they buy the sassy one,

1198
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:50,920
who's like, "Hey, I see you, baa, baa."

1199
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:52,640
So, what do the people do with these sheep?

1200
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:55,800
Whatever they want! Sky is the limit.

1201
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:57,480
You know, some have them as pets.

1202
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:59,720
Some have them as security for the house.

1203
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:01,160
A lot of the people...

1204
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:03,280
The new thing is training them

1205
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:06,000
to fight each other in the Sheep Fight Club.

1206
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:09,200
Sheep Fight Clubs?

1207
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:11,200
Yes. All the sheeps, they get together.

1208
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,880
They baa, all you hear is, "Baa, baa, baa."

1209
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:15,480
And then you see hoof, kick, hoof, kick,

1210
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:17,320
hoof, kick, baa, baa, baa, baa, baa!

1211
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:18,640
And then he's out.

1212
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:22,240
And that is how we met. She bought a sheep from me.

1213
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:24,080
Really? Why?

1214
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,200
Children? Okay, tune out.

1215
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:30,240
Okay, 'cause some secrets are coming
out, all right? Some adult ones.

1216
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:33,160
She likes to shave the sheep

1217
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:37,560
for the pelt for the sex, sexuals, yes.

1218
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,840
She has got a real fetish

1219
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,240
for the wool and stuff, you know.

1220
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:43,320
We do this thing called "sheepstenein."

1221
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:46,480
Danny? Would you come with me, please?

1222
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:47,880
Yeah. Absolutely.

1223
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:49,360
So, we're gonna leave right now.

1224
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,200
So you guys play that game
that we always love to play,

1225
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:52,320
Nobody Talk game.

1226
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,560
And start now.

1227
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:56,040
I'm sorry, we're leaving. I can't do it. No.

1228
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:57,360
I'm gonna kill that guy. He's lost it.

1229
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:58,920
He was going sheep-crazy, I'll give you that.

1230
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,240
Where is your hand right now?

1231
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:01,520
You wanna see where it is?

1232
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,040
It's not even here anymore! It's gone!

1233
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,160
How about I beat him up?

1234
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,920
You can beat him up with me. It'll be fun.

1235
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:07,720
I don't want to! I have to go.

1236
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:09,880
Don't bail on me right now! Don't
make that face at me.

1237
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,120
I cannot stand that face.

1238
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,280
Katherine?

1239
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:14,200
Katherine Murphy?

1240
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:17,960
Oh, my God, Devlin Adams.

1241
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,800
Devlin? Devlin as in taking a...

1242
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:23,920
Taking? From what I see...

1243
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:26,240
It's my favorite college Devlin!

1244
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:30,240
Both of us here at this resort at the same time.

1245
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:33,080
I didn't know you came to places like this.

1246
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:34,200
Here we go.

1247
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:35,280
Honey!

1248
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,080
Honey, I want you to meet someone.

1249
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:41,240
This is one of my best friends from my sorority.

1250
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:44,080
Katherine, this is my husband, lan Maxtone Jones.

1251
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:45,240
Pleasure.

1252
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:48,160
You might've heard of him. He invented the iPod.

1253
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:51,440
Well, of course he did. The iPod.

1254
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:53,800
The idea just came to me in the shower.

1255
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:57,480
A shower that I was taking with Devlin.

1256
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,280
So, this is a cabana you guys
got yourselves here, huh?

1257
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,840
Because my skin is so white.
I don't like to get it burned.

1258
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,680
Even at night?

1259
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,400
Well, in Hawaii, you never know with the sun.

1260
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:10,600
Very, very strong.

1261
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:13,560
So you mean like a moonburn or...

1262
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,120
You look fantastic. Oh...

1263
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:18,520
You look great.

1264
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:21,840
I'm so glad you got your teeth fixed. Much better.

1265
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:26,600
You are just the same glorious Devlin that I remember.

1266
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:29,520
Oh, my God, I ran into Sandra Wernick last month.

1267
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:33,480
The poor thing. She's already
divorced and she has a child.

1268
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:36,360
She's a single mother. It's a disaster.

1269
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,040
I feel so bad for her.

1270
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:39,840
Are you married?

1271
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:41,760
Mmm-hmm. Yes.

1272
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:45,760
Oh! I've neglected to introduce you to Danny,

1273
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:50,600
Daniel Leroy Maccabee Ill, my husband.

1274
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,840
Yes. If you want me to stay,

1275
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:54,040
will you just go with it, honey?

1276
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:55,600
Come here and please meet Devlin and lan.

1277
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:58,280
Hey. This is Daniel.

1278
00:53:58,520 --> 00:53:59,760
IPod, what's up? How are you?

1279
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:00,880
I'm fine.

1280
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:03,040
Invented it. Pleasure. I heard.

1281
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:06,000
Devlin, I think I spoke about you with my wife

1282
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:07,840
in the bathroom one or two times, right?

1283
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:09,040
We did.

1284
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,480
Number two.

1285
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:12,200
We did it twice, yes.

1286
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:14,960
So, chief, tell me, what do you do for a living?

1287
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:17,080
I'm also an inventor, just like you.

1288
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:18,800
I invented the barking hand.

1289
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:22,320
I got you. But you're sunburned?

1290
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:23,920
No. What?

1291
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:25,760
You are a surgeon.

1292
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:28,560
He's a plastic surgeon, and he's one of the best

1293
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:30,400
according to Los Angeles Magazine.

1294
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:32,000
Touchdown!

1295
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:33,880
Yes. Well, that, yeah.

1296
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:35,080
Touched it down.

1297
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:37,520
We gotta go back. We have to
run. It was great to see you.

1298
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:39,200
We have to get back to our kids. So...

1299
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:40,600
You have kids?

1300
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:43,000
Mmm-hmm. Yeah, two, actually.

1301
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:45,280
We couldn't wait to start creating lives.

1302
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:48,520
And by the way, I created these children

1303
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:50,240
in the shower. Right?

1304
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:51,880
You did. You know what I'm saying, homeboy?

1305
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:55,040
That is funny.

1306
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:56,600
Wow, you've been together a long time.

1307
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,600
Am I gonna leave this girl? Look at her.

1308
00:54:58,800 --> 00:54:59,920
Still gets the flag up the pole,

1309
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,280
if you know what I mean.

1310
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:03,920
Bing-bang. An iRod, I should say.

1311
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:05,600
Oh. Come on, hit that. Why'd you
leave me hanging so long?

1312
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:07,720
You're so clever. That's so silly.

1313
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:09,280
The four of us should get together

1314
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:10,640
and have dinner one night.

1315
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:13,240
Oh! That would be almost like a dream of mine.

1316
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:17,320
If we could ever get ourselves out of the bedroom.

1317
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:19,760
Katherine Murphy, look at you!

1318
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:23,120
Oh, no, not Murphy anymore. Leroy Maccabee.

1319
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,280
That's right.

1320
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:28,360
The third. Anyway, so it was great
to see you and meet you, lan.

1321
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:30,520
The big E. Love the Shuffle, by the way.

1322
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:32,800
Good to meet you. Bye! Thanks. You, too!

1323
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
What are you talking about? She was nice.

1324
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,200
I'm gonna kill you. Come on.
You need me, though, right?

1325
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:38,440
I don't believe that just happened.

1326
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:39,800
I like that you need me. How's that make you feel?

1327
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:42,440
Please, it feels like a car door
just slowly shut on my soul.

1328
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:43,680
Come here! Listen. What?

1329
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:45,040
Do you know how I feel right now?

1330
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:46,240
You were getting me so upset,

1331
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:47,360
bringing me into that web of lies.

1332
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:48,560
My hand's right here right now.

1333
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:49,760
Oh, my hand's right there.

1334
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:51,000
You know what? I hate you right now.

1335
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:53,160
I've gotta write out a bunch of index cards

1336
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:54,920
just to keep up with these lies.

1337
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,920
Yeah, and you're gonna make me
copies, too. And one more thing.

1338
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:02,240
Oh, my God, why are we
leaving the hotel right now?

1339
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:04,720
Oh, my God, why are we
leaving the hotel right now?

1340
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:06,240
Why did you wake me up?

1341
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:07,440
Because, Grandpa,

1342
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:10,400
I signed us up for the all-day adventure tour.

1343
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:13,240
We're gonna go hiking in the rainforest,
and kayaking down rivers

1344
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:15,040
and swimming under waterfalls.

1345
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:17,160
Swimming. I hope you mean skinny-dipping.

1346
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:18,680
I'm gonna suggest swimming.

1347
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:21,520
I, however, am fine with some man nudity, Danny.

1348
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:25,360
Okay, so Swiss Family nightmare is coming with us.

1349
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:27,240
That's so we can bond?

1350
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:29,360
Oh, that'll be great!

1351
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:35,080
It's bloody breathtaking out here!

1352
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:37,240
Is this where the blue Avatar people live?

1353
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:40,000
Yeah, the blue Avatar people and I think that black pig.

1354
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:42,440
Where? The pig.

1355
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:44,440
Look, how cute. Looks like Babe.

1356
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:47,880
Oh, my God! Go, Go!

1357
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:49,720
Come on, go, go!

1358
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:54,760
The pig is eating my body!

1359
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:17,880
Keep your eyes on the river, sweetheart.

1360
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:20,640
Yes. I was looking at the canyon.

1361
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,640
Hey, what're you guys doing?

1362
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:32,120
That bridge can only handle one person at a time!

1363
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:34,720
Go, go, go!

1364
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,960
What'd he say? What'd you say?

1365
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:44,000
Holy Devlin! Ow!

1366
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:46,000
Come on, let's go.

1367
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:48,880
Piggyback times are magical times, aren't they?

1368
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:50,960
Yeah, aren't they? You're warping my spine now.

1369
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:55,240
I think Kiki slipped.

1370
00:57:57,080 --> 00:58:00,400
Oh, Father, I just love spending time with you!

1371
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:04,600
Oh, my God!

1372
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:07,400
You guys, look at this!

1373
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:09,520
Oh, my God! MAGGIE: It's lovely!

1374
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:11,960
Wow! That is unbelievable.

1375
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:15,360
I don't know about you guys,
but I am gonna go cool off.

1376
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,200
Really? There could be black pigs in there.

1377
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:19,080
I agree.

1378
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:20,800
Look at that. That's terrific.

1379
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:24,480
Does the hotel know you took those
pillows, honey?

1380
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:27,800
She really wears that bikini well.

1381
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:29,160
Yeah.

1382
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:32,520
You know what she'd wear well?
Dental floss and a pirate hat.

1383
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:34,320
Don't say that. Absolutely gross.

1384
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:38,120
Oh, my God! Gorgeous!

1385
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:39,320
Perfect.

1386
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:42,480
That was a ten! A perfect ten! Yay!

1387
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:45,640
So, Al Jolson, you mind jumping in the water

1388
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:48,000
and also screaming on the way
down, "I love my daddy"?

1389
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:49,560
Okay.

1390
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:51,360
Yeah, do it, do it for me.

1391
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:53,000
I love my daddy.

1392
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:55,160
Daddy is my favorite adult!

1393
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:58,360
You're paying her enough for this, right?

1394
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:01,400
And I love you, my little British crumpet!

1395
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,200
All right, homeboy, you're up next. Let's go.

1396
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:05,960
Come up with something on your own.

1397
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:09,400
You gotta squeeze out another log?

1398
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:11,240
What happened? What'd he whisper to you?

1399
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:13,200
Water's too deep.

1400
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:14,760
Water's too deep for what?

1401
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:16,040
He can't swim.

1402
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:18,120
He can't swim?

1403
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:20,960
And you wanna swim with the dolphins?

1404
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:22,880
That makes a lot of sense.

1405
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:25,160
Hadn't thought it through.

1406
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:27,000
No kidding you didn't think it through.

1407
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:28,920
Thought about spending all my
money, though, didn't you?

1408
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:31,440
Danny! I'm saying, I'm not the kid's...

1409
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:33,880
Okay. No one taught you how to swim, huh?

1410
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:37,600
Well, my dad's supposed to, but he's busy.

1411
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:39,840
Uh-huh. Busy being an idiot.

1412
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:54,600
You guys have to come in, the water feels magical!

1413
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:58,360
I got something magical, too.
Right in the downstairs area.

1414
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:00,120
I don't high-five when it's...

1415
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:01,400
Downstairs area!

1416
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:03,200
No, put it away. Sorry. No, stop.

1417
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:06,200
You know what? I think Mommy's gonna
explore the magical waters.

1418
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:08,280
Honey, are you okay to hang
out here with fake Daddy?

1419
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:09,960
Sure.

1420
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:11,600
Really? You're gonna get undressed?

1421
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:12,680
What are you doing?

1422
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:14,440
What? You got a bathing cap, too?

1423
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:15,720
You're the worst.

1424
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:18,760
A 1920s swimming gown on, honey?

1425
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,040
Don't do it. Don't take it off.

1426
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,120
Yeah. I have to be alone.

1427
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:38,440
Okay.

1428
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:44,280
God, I gotta start taking the stairs more.

1429
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:45,480
Don't buy that line.

1430
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,920
She takes spinning classes like they're M&M's.

1431
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:56,520
I think he's wearing my underwear.

1432
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:00,080
What is he doing?

1433
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:02,440
Yo, I guarantee you fall!

1434
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:03,960
I'm all set.

1435
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:07,760
Ow!

1436
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:09,520
Thank you, God.

1437
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,640
I wanna climb Palmer Mountain,

1438
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:16,440
so what do you say we get rid of these kids?

1439
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:19,160
No. They had them last night. It's our turn.

1440
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:21,680
Isn't that how things work? We alternate?

1441
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:23,200
What? No.

1442
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:26,160
I get the kids... I had them today.

1443
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:27,560
That counted as a "me" day

1444
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:28,760
and then she gets them at night.

1445
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:30,040
That's how we do it. Oh.

1446
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:32,800
Dolph, Devlin, do you want us to watch the kids

1447
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:34,960
so that you guys can have a little alone time?

1448
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:37,200
I don't think... Yes! Absoshnutely!

1449
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:38,560
We are sleeping together!

1450
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,480
You guys have your own beds and it's our time!

1451
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:43,200
So we're gonna watch them. Good.

1452
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:46,640
You guys wanna come take a look at the balcony?

1453
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:47,840
I think I saw some dolphins around here.

1454
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:51,200
Dolphins? Hey, he loves those, right? Dolphins.

1455
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:52,400
Sorry. Okay, go.

1456
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:53,840
All right, let go. Come on.

1457
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:55,320
Get the dolphins. Bye, you guys.

1458
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:57,080
That's why we're here, the dolphins.

1459
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:58,240
See you out there.

1460
01:01:58,400 --> 01:01:59,840
Listen, if anything happens

1461
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:01,480
and you need any... And I mean anything,

1462
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:02,720
you have to call me.

1463
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:04,320
I'm good at this, I swear to you.

1464
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:06,520
I used to baby-sit Eddie when we were children.

1465
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:08,960
Eddie is your fault? No, no, no.

1466
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:10,840
But I want you to enjoy tonight.

1467
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:12,000
Come on, it's like a free night.

1468
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:13,520
You can do whatever you want.

1469
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:15,440
You can knit yourself some socks

1470
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:17,440
or shock people with your sneaky hot body.

1471
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:19,240
I don't know what you're talking about. Cary Grant?

1472
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:20,720
I'm just gonna sit in my room

1473
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:23,360
and worry about you and them and everything.

1474
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:25,280
What about just hang out platonically

1475
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:27,000
with Eddie tonight? Have some dinner?

1476
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:28,440
Or is he not good enough?

1477
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:31,520
You need Brian, the guy from Foghat, around here.

1478
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:32,920
That really bothered you

1479
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:34,880
that I went to lunch with that guy.

1480
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,520
What do you mean, you went to lunch with him?

1481
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:38,560
I told you I was going to lunch with him.

1482
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:40,440
I thought it was he asked you to lunch

1483
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:41,760
and you were gonna like scoff at it.

1484
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:44,200
But you did? You fell for his charms?

1485
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:47,040
I don't even understand what this is.

1486
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:48,440
It's the beard, man.

1487
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:49,840
It doesn't move!

1488
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:52,720
Well, yeah, in the wind, man. It's flapping around.

1489
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:54,360
All right. You know what? I'll tell you this.

1490
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:56,960
The guy made it through an entire lunch with a woman

1491
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:58,680
without making up a fake life.

1492
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:00,320
Ah.

1493
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:02,080
You just hurt me.

1494
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:05,240
That was not nice, but it was the truth.

1495
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:07,400
And I speak the truth.

1496
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:09,120
Please pay attention to my children.

1497
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:10,360
Everything will be nice.

1498
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:13,240
They serve room service in the hallway.

1499
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:15,760
I'm so nauseous. Okay. Bye.

1500
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:21,040
Alone at last!

1501
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:27,520
Let's play the game.

1502
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:29,640
We were doing so good with the game.

1503
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:34,320
"If you could be one person besides yourself,

1504
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:35,720
"who would you be?"

1505
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:38,520
Rachael Ray, because I've always

1506
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:39,600
wanted to know how to cook.

1507
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:41,440
Really? Oh, she's darling.

1508
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:44,200
You know what? I don't really wanna be anyone else.

1509
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:46,960
I'm happy with who I am. I choose me.

1510
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:49,320
Or Captain Kirk. Either one.

1511
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:51,200
See, that's a good one. All right.

1512
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:52,520
What about you, Bart?

1513
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:55,600
Mr. DeCesare.

1514
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:58,000
Our mailman? Why?

1515
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:02,040
He just seems like he's got it all figured out.

1516
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:03,840
We're getting deep.

1517
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:07,160
Okay, moving on. Uh...

1518
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:10,960
Okay. "Name something that makes you sad."

1519
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:16,800
That Judi Dench has never won
the Oscar for Best Actress.

1520
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:19,600
It's a travesty.

1521
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:22,960
That 'N Sync broke up.

1522
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:26,360
Yeah. That was rough on all of us.

1523
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:28,640
Who's 'N Sync?

1524
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:31,840
Sadness. Bart, you're up.

1525
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,040
I don't wanna say mine.

1526
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:36,960
Okay. Let's move on then.

1527
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:38,200
Hey!

1528
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:40,480
Honey, come on. You can share anything with us.

1529
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:41,680
Yeah, share.

1530
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:43,480
He looks like he's about to lose it, but okay.

1531
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:47,840
When my dad doesn't have time for me.

1532
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:50,160
Come on, it's okay.

1533
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:53,400
We're okay. We're okay. It's fine.

1534
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:56,160
It's all gonna be okay. Come on.

1535
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:58,360
We don't need him in our lives.

1536
01:04:58,840 --> 01:04:59,840
Wow.

1537
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:01,240
No, no, no, he's...

1538
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:02,560
We're okay. It's fine.

1539
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:04,160
It's all gonna be okay.

1540
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:06,200
This has nothing to...

1541
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:08,600
This is, like, from a long time ago!

1542
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,680
It's okay.

1543
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:14,520
What are you doing?

1544
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:17,280
Well, that was a major setback.

1545
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:20,360
"When my dad doesn't have time
for me."

1546
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:22,320
We're sorry.

1547
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:23,560
I know you're sorry.

1548
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:25,400
I know you got real stuff going on with your family.

1549
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:26,760
And it's painful.

1550
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:28,720
But you gotta just hold it in

1551
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:30,400
till you get to the mainland again.

1552
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:31,720
You're the ones who wanted to come here

1553
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:32,960
and go swimming with the dolphins

1554
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:35,200
or standing with the dolphins because you can't swim.

1555
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:37,400
Can you act professional? BOTH: Yes, sir.

1556
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:39,600
For at least two more days, until I kill you off

1557
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:41,760
in a boarding school train accident?

1558
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:43,600
I thought it was a car accident.

1559
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:44,760
I don't know. Either that

1560
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:46,200
or a science explosion, just something.

1561
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:48,520
You're gonna be dead soon. That's
the good news. Okay?

1562
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:50,800
So, can you just focus for a few more days?

1563
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:52,240
Yes. Good.

1564
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:54,920
So, give me some fake hugs right
now and laugh real loud

1565
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,280
like we're the happiest family on earth.

1566
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:57,920
Okay. Is that possible?

1567
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:00,480
And laughing, laughing, laughing.

1568
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:03,080
Okay, that's it. Laugh louder, louder.

1569
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:07,040
I love you guys!

1570
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:09,600
Hey, sweetie! What's going on? What's up?

1571
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:12,800
So, kids, I just got off the phone with your mom

1572
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,480
and you guys are gonna have plenty of time

1573
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:17,000
to spend with your dad tomorrow

1574
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:20,240
because she and I are gonna
have a nice, long spa day.

1575
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:21,400
Aw!

1576
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:24,480
Awesome! Awesome, awesome.

1577
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:26,520
You guys are so...

1578
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:29,560
I'll see you in a minute, okay? I love you.

1579
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:34,760
Okay, he's losing it. Okay, good night.

1580
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:35,920
He's losing it.

1581
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,000
All right, here we go. Everybody out.

1582
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,480
So, what are we doing?

1583
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:45,000
Palmer forgot her camera in the room

1584
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:46,560
so I'm gonna have a surprise for her

1585
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:48,040
when she gets back from the spa.

1586
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:49,480
A stolen camera?

1587
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:52,120
No, some pictures of us having a great time

1588
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:54,840
reassuring her of all the fun we have together.

1589
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:58,880
I forgot to flush the toilet before I left the hotel.

1590
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:00,720
So she's gonna have two surprises.

1591
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:04,000
Okay. No one's supposed to crap as much as you do.

1592
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:06,360
You gotta look into that Pepto Bismol or something.

1593
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:08,640
Here's your putters. Bing.

1594
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:10,560
And a bam. Thank you.

1595
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:13,640
Let's just look right in the camera.
And we're having fun.

1596
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:15,640
And we're a family. We love each other.

1597
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:17,520
And boo!

1598
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:20,320
All right, let's do the old Michael-hit-a-putt shot. Okay?

1599
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:22,360
So boom, that's in the hole.

1600
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:23,640
And you're excited about that,

1601
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:26,760
and we're happy for him, and...

1602
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:29,200
Maggie just hit the ball, but you
followed through too much

1603
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:30,720
and it made you fall on your back.

1604
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:32,160
Okay, but... Look at this.

1605
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:34,480
You're laughing, but I'm a concerned
father, so I'm like,

1606
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:36,440
"Oh, my God."

1607
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:38,360
All right, now,

1608
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:40,520
let's just laugh at something I
say, because I'm a funny dad.

1609
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:42,560
You're very close with me, and
you think I'm funny, and...

1610
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:43,960
Why are we always laughing?

1611
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,360
Is there something wrong with us?

1612
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:48,360
No. You're just amused by everything
I say. So, here we go.

1613
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:50,920
Can we take a break? Do something really fun?

1614
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:52,720
No, we're not doing anything fun, man.

1615
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:54,400
We're here to fake having fun.

1616
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:55,640
Come on. Right to the camera.

1617
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:58,600
Don't worry. We never have
fun with our real dad either.

1618
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:01,200
Oh, man.

1619
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:03,920
All right. How's this?

1620
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,520
I'll teach you how to swim, okay?

1621
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:07,360
Before your mother gets back

1622
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:09,920
from the "spa day" in four hours?

1623
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:11,760
Is that even possible? Yeah.

1624
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:13,680
But we're gonna take one more
picture, if you don't mind.

1625
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:16,040
Make that two pictures. Maggie.

1626
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:18,840
Throw this straight in the air. Make it look like...

1627
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:20,600
On the count of three, one, two,
three.

1628
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:21,760
Okay.

1629
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:23,400
Now, Michael, lay down.

1630
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:26,360
On your back. And...

1631
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:28,880
Yeah, all the way over. See if you can clench this.

1632
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:30,800
Now look like you're in pain.

1633
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:32,280
Ooh!

1634
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:37,640
It took my friend a whole summer
to learn how to swim.

1635
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:39,360
How're you gonna teach me so quick?

1636
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:41,960
I'm gonna do it the same way
my grandfather taught me.

1637
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,320
Don't worry.

1638
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:49,520
It took Grandpa eight hours to teach us.

1639
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:50,600
It was a nightmare.

1640
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,560
But there's two of us here now, and we're sober.

1641
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:55,000
You're gonna be fine.

1642
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:57,280
All right. You're doing great.

1643
01:08:57,440 --> 01:08:59,120
Is he doing great? He's doing great.

1644
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:00,800
Okay. We want to advance a little, though.

1645
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:02,800
I need you to swim to Uncle Eddie.

1646
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:04,400
If you get there without touching the bottom,

1647
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:05,800
we'll give you a dolphin cookie.

1648
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:09,760
Is that what your grandpa gave you?

1649
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:12,920
No, Grandpa gave us something he'd call a Heineken.

1650
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:14,000
I want one of those.

1651
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:15,320
No. Stick with the dolphin cookie.

1652
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:18,160
Yeah. They hurt less when they
get thrown at your head.

1653
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:19,760
God, he was a sick man.

1654
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:22,160
Yeah. Okay? Are we ready?

1655
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:23,600
Don't think about it. Commit. Kick, kick.

1656
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:25,440
Get the cookie. Move your feet.

1657
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:28,640
Kick, kick!

1658
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:30,640
Right there! Reach for it! You got it!

1659
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:31,840
Doing good, buddy!

1660
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:34,960
There you go!

1661
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:37,120
My boy! That was terrific, buddy.

1662
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:39,680
Have your cookie. We're gonna move on, though.

1663
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:41,080
Hey, Devlin?

1664
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:44,200
Devlin? Yeah?

1665
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:46,560
So, Danny's birthday is next week,

1666
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:48,240
and I have no idea what to get him.

1667
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:52,840
Well, don't get him a tie.

1668
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:55,080
He has 100 of them and he never wears them.

1669
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:56,240
That's good to know.

1670
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:58,640
He loves books on tape for his car.

1671
01:09:58,720 --> 01:09:59,920
Fishing gear.

1672
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:02,640
Loves it. Doesn't use it.

1673
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:04,200
Can't take the fish off of the hook

1674
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:06,200
once he catches it, so he just collects it.

1675
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:10,240
He loves candy. Jelly Bellies. Loves them, his favorite.

1676
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:12,320
But he only likes the Cotton Candy
and the Peanut Butter.

1677
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:14,520
So you have to buy the bag of the Jelly Bellies,

1678
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:16,160
separate the Cotton Candy and the Peanut Butter

1679
01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:17,320
and put them into a little...

1680
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:19,320
It's a kind of Ziploc baggies that I got online.

1681
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:21,360
You know so much about him.

1682
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:23,520
Yeah.

1683
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,440
I've known the guy forever.

1684
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:30,400
Music. Loves music.

1685
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:32,760
But anything after '95, don't bother.

1686
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:34,040
You'll lose him.

1687
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:36,440
That's when I finished my Girl Scouts.

1688
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:40,280
All right. How many cookies do we got left?

1689
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:42,280
Maybe about forty!

1690
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:45,080
What do you think, 40 feet for 40 cookies?

1691
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:46,880
Can you handle that? You need a little rest?

1692
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:48,040
Let's do this.

1693
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:51,120
Really? Okay, he's ready! He's ready to rock!

1694
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:52,520
Almost.

1695
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:53,920
What? No.

1696
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:57,920
Oh, my! Ladies and gentlemen, off come the floaties!

1697
01:10:58,200 --> 01:10:59,920
This is getting serious!

1698
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,160
Are you sure about this, Michael?

1699
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:02,960
Hell, yeah. All right.

1700
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:05,120
No matter what, you're a good man, okay?

1701
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:07,480
Keep kicking. I'm here if you need me.

1702
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:08,600
You got this.

1703
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:10,240
Go! Go, Michael!

1704
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:11,880
Go! Breathe! Yeah!

1705
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:13,560
Kick it! Go!

1706
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:15,080
Move your arms! Yeah!

1707
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:18,400
He doesn't have floaties on!

1708
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:20,080
Oh, my God!

1709
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:21,480
Get the cookies!

1710
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:23,400
Come on, sweetheart! You've got it!

1711
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:24,520
A little bit more, little bit more.

1712
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:29,240
Swim! Swim! KATHERINE: Oh, my God!

1713
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:30,680
Come on! Just a little bit more!

1714
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:33,600
Keep going, Michael! Don't give up!

1715
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:41,320
Very nice!

1716
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:44,240
That's my boy! Yeah, buddy!

1717
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:47,920
I did it! I did it! Thank you!

1718
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:49,640
No way, that was you, buddy.

1719
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:52,200
That was awesome. Way to go!

1720
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:01,800
What are we looking at?

1721
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:04,640
Jeez. Oh, God. Devlin.

1722
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:08,640
Devlin. Oh, God. You snuck up on me.

1723
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:10,400
Did I? Oh... Yes.

1724
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:13,080
Do you startle easily? That's a sign of menopause.

1725
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:14,160
Hmm...

1726
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:15,800
Devlin?

1727
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:18,040
Palmer Dodge, this is Devlin.

1728
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:20,200
She and I went to college together.

1729
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:23,280
Aloha, Palmer.

1730
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:25,200
Is this your daughter?

1731
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:29,040
No, no, no. I'm actually the girlfriend.

1732
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:30,200
Whose girlfriend?

1733
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:32,720
Yes, hi.

1734
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:36,080
I am the Dolph. Willkommen.
And you're very beautiful.

1735
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:38,320
Married, flattered. Thanks. Where's Danny?

1736
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:42,080
Danny is in the water teaching
our little boy how to swim.

1737
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:43,320
Hi, Doctor!

1738
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:45,400
He was so sweet.

1739
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:47,720
You know what's so crazy is that
I have never met anybody

1740
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:49,200
with the first name Devlin before.

1741
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:51,920
You know, and here you are, and
your name's Devlin and...

1742
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:53,400
Shark attack!

1743
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:57,480
We are playing Bavarian pool rugby
and now I'm in the lead.

1744
01:12:57,680 --> 01:12:58,880
Okay, bye!

1745
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:03,240
She's trying to beat me, but she won't.

1746
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:05,320
No one can!

1747
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:06,480
This is fun!

1748
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:08,920
Anyway, something's opened
up in our schedule tonight.

1749
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,600
So, we were wondering if you and Danny

1750
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:11,920
were good to go for dinner.

1751
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,280
Oceano's. Seven o'clock. Oh, no...

1752
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:17,560
Oh, no, you don't! She's like a shark. Come on.

1753
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:19,840
Is it a bad night? Are you two fighting?

1754
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:21,560
No! We're not fighting.

1755
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:23,760
No, we just, we're delighting. We're just fine.

1756
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:26,560
No, that's great. Tonight's gonna
happen. Yeah, perfect.

1757
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:28,440
Perfect. Anyway, see you tonight!

1758
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:29,760
Okay, Devlin.

1759
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:31,920
Oh, my God! Dolph, let her breathe!

1760
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:34,040
Yes, I...

1761
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:35,600
Dolph! What?

1762
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:36,760
What was that?

1763
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:41,120
I was... Were you under...

1764
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:44,720
I don't understand. Why would you say yes?

1765
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:47,600
Because I didn't know, I didn't say no.

1766
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:50,360
I'm not leaving here. What would I tell Palmer?

1767
01:13:57,760 --> 01:13:59,160
What's going on, sweetie?

1768
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:03,240
So, today, you know, with Dolph
pushing me in the pool.

1769
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:04,640
It was weird, right?

1770
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:06,880
No, no, no. He's a sheepherder.

1771
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:08,280
That's what those guys do, you know?

1772
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:10,240
They do a lot of horseplay

1773
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:12,240
and that's kind of initiation time for you.

1774
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:13,920
You're in the gang, I think.

1775
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:16,520
Okay. Yeah.

1776
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:19,360
Well, I was thinking for tonight,

1777
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:22,720
maybe we could have a little me and you time?

1778
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:24,080
Oh!

1779
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:28,680
I'll get my rubber duck and see you in a sec.

1780
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:32,320
Yeah, no, I'm not doing this tonight.

1781
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:34,520
It's like my first night alone with the girl.

1782
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:36,360
All I'm asking you is one favor!

1783
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:40,120
Just get this one dinner with me so I can save face

1784
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:42,760
with this horrible, heinous human being.

1785
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:44,040
What am I gonna tell Palmer?

1786
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:45,360
Would you just put her on the phone?

1787
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:51,360
Oh, God.

1788
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:53,520
Tell me she is not listening to 'N Sync.

1789
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:56,400
No, no, no. It's coming from the elevator.

1790
01:14:56,720 --> 01:14:57,800
Hey!

1791
01:14:57,880 --> 01:14:59,480
Danny, that is my jam.

1792
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:01,800
Someone on the phone for you.

1793
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,520
Okay.

1794
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:05,560
Hello?

1795
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:07,160
What is that?

1796
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:08,560
It's Palmer. So?

1797
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:10,400
I need you to get on the phone.
I need you to ask her out.

1798
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:12,240
I need you to take her as far away
from the hotel for the entire night.

1799
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:13,440
Would you please just do this for me?

1800
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:16,160
No, I'm already eating. I just wanna hang out. Ow!

1801
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:17,960
Seriously, I need you. What are you doing? No.

1802
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:19,640
Ow! My gosh.

1803
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:21,480
Take it. All right.

1804
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:23,680
Go for Dolph.

1805
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:25,320
It's Dolph.

1806
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:26,680
Okay, I got an idea.

1807
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:28,680
How about you and me,

1808
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:31,480
we go and get the dinner tonight?

1809
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:32,640
To supper?

1810
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:34,000
Tonight?

1811
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:35,280
Yes, and we get to know each other,

1812
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:37,240
because I think it's important for the kids

1813
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:40,880
to have good symmetry in the family unit.

1814
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,080
Yeah, hang on. Let me check with Danny.

1815
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:45,400
Dolph wants to do dinner tonight.

1816
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:47,240
No. No, no, no.

1817
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:48,720
All right, tell him yeah.

1818
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:52,000
Yeah, that's fine.

1819
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:55,040
Awesome. Thank you so much.

1820
01:15:55,560 --> 01:15:56,880
What am I supposed to say to her all night?

1821
01:15:57,160 --> 01:16:01,680
You spout crazy nonsense for hours in Eurotrashenese.

1822
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:05,120
Just do it, but just do it far away from the hotel.

1823
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:06,560
Okay, fine, I'll do it,

1824
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:09,120
but if I do good, can I sleep in the bed with you?

1825
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:13,040
No. Why? You've got a great private room.

1826
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:27,800
Hmm, really? Because when
we were in the Napa Valley,

1827
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:30,360
they said that wasn't a good time of year for Merlot.

1828
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:33,720
Oh. How about the Verite Cabernet?

1829
01:16:34,280 --> 01:16:35,840
Isn't Cabernet really grapey?

1830
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:38,080
I mean, I like grapey, but not overly grapey.

1831
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:40,120
Did you go over the index cards?

1832
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:42,240
I glanced at them, yes.

1833
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:43,440
You glanced at them?

1834
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:45,000
I graduated med school

1835
01:16:45,080 --> 01:16:47,560
without reading a book. Just relax.

1836
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:49,800
Just give us the most expensive bottle you have

1837
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:51,560
and it'll probably be good enough.

1838
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:52,880
Perfect!

1839
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:57,320
Look at us, Katherine. Both so
happily married. I mean...

1840
01:16:57,560 --> 01:16:59,120
Can you believe it?

1841
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:01,760
Everything I always hoped for, right, Yogi?

1842
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:02,960
Mmm. Boo-Boo.

1843
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,800
My Yogi Bear. My Boo-Boo.

1844
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:08,360
Never enough.

1845
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:23,800
Hold on a second.

1846
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:27,400
I love the way you smell.

1847
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:30,040
Nothing smells as good as Devlin.

1848
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:33,480
Smelling Devlin, always a good thing.

1849
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:41,000
This is really where we're eating?

1850
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:42,720
Oh, yes. No, the hotel says

1851
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:45,600
it's amazing und very far away. Yeah, it's good.

1852
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:47,920
Hey. I want that car.

1853
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,480
I'll give you two chickens for it.

1854
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:52,440
Two chickens, that's very nice of you, but...

1855
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:53,600
Don't be scared.

1856
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:54,880
We're just here for dinner.

1857
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:57,320
Also, this car's worth about 10,000 chickens.

1858
01:17:58,040 --> 01:17:59,520
Don't pour over me.

1859
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:00,920
Don't pour over me.

1860
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:03,920
I'll bring my glass to you.

1861
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:08,040
So, Danny, you're a plastic surgeon. Yes.

1862
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:10,120
Very convenient for you, Katherine.

1863
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:12,120
No, this girl's had nothing done.

1864
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:13,560
She's just a natural beauty.

1865
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:14,800
She really is. Sweetie.

1866
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:17,400
What about me? What would you do to fix me?

1867
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:19,440
Professionally speaking?

1868
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:21,200
Nothing. I wouldn't do a thing to you.

1869
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:22,400
Nothing?

1870
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:24,120
You're too sweet.

1871
01:18:24,680 --> 01:18:26,520
They already took too much fat out of your arms,

1872
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:27,960
but that's what sleeves are for.

1873
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:30,960
So, where did you two meet?

1874
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:35,160
We just, we met at a concert.

1875
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:36,480
Sting. Yeah.

1876
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:38,480
Live at the Index Card.

1877
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:41,200
It was a benefit for the rainforest.

1878
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:45,200
Someone's on the phone for you.

1879
01:18:45,240 --> 01:18:47,000
I think it's the guy from The Omen.

1880
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:51,160
Go for the iMan.

1881
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:53,160
Hold on a second.

1882
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:56,000
Can I say something before you
say what you're gonna say?

1883
01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:59,880
Seeing the man who invented the iPod, on the iPhone,

1884
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:02,320
saying, "Go for the iMan..." Yeah.

1885
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:04,440
...that was like watching Ronald McDonald

1886
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:06,240
eat a cheeseburger off the Grimace.

1887
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:08,520
I'm serious. That was serious stuff.
- It's so true.

1888
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:12,520
That, to me, was like watching
Dr. Kevorkian kill himself.

1889
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:13,680
Oh, no.

1890
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:16,200
I'm sorry. This is one of my foundations.

1891
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:17,760
I've gotta take this.

1892
01:19:18,440 --> 01:19:21,320
Your virtue, your intelligence, your passion.

1893
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:25,480
Your beauty, your drive, and your womanhood.

1894
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:35,040
It's something we do whenever the other leaves.

1895
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:37,280
We say what we love most about the other.

1896
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:39,000
That's really nice. That's big. I like that.

1897
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:40,360
You guys should try it.

1898
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:43,280
Yes, we should. We should. We'll try that later.

1899
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:45,200
We have to. Not everyone can do it.

1900
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:47,440
We'll do it now.

1901
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:49,640
Right now. Okay.

1902
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:51,800
So, broke and penniless,

1903
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:54,600
I took to the streets to sell my wares.

1904
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:57,000
And by wares, I mean my body.

1905
01:19:57,280 --> 01:19:59,560
And by body, I mean my schnitzel.

1906
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:00,960
Mmm.

1907
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:03,280
Help! Is there a veterinarian in the house?

1908
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:05,840
My pet sheep, he passed out. He's not breathing!

1909
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:07,240
I don't know what's wrong with him!

1910
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:11,200
Him! Him! He's not a vet, but
he sells sheep for a living.

1911
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:13,480
Oh, me, yes.

1912
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:15,920
I do, yes. I am that.

1913
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,160
Please come this way!

1914
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:18,680
Now? Yes!

1915
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:19,920
This way, this way!

1916
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,160
What is this?

1917
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:23,200
Is that a real sheep?

1918
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:27,520
Okay.

1919
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:29,760
Yes, um...

1920
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:32,400
Hello...

1921
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:33,680
Yes?

1922
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:39,720
Yes, in my expert opinion, that sheep is dead.

1923
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:41,040
I'm very sorry.

1924
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:43,000
Let's go eat. Okay, show's over. Let's go.

1925
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:45,880
Oh! He's still alive!

1926
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:47,200
Please, you have to do something!

1927
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:49,240
Oh, shit on me.

1928
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:51,680
You look each other in the eyes

1929
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:54,520
and you say what you love about
the other. Mmm-hmm.

1930
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:57,720
We can't just say it? We gotta look
at each other for this thing?

1931
01:20:57,800 --> 01:20:59,680
Okay. Yes. We're so ready.

1932
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:01,120
Are you ready?

1933
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:02,440
Go ahead.

1934
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:04,840
You're on. Okay.

1935
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:06,280
Come on.

1936
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:08,640
Um...

1937
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:13,720
I love your sense of humor.

1938
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:15,960
You do? Mmm-hmm.

1939
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:17,360
All of it?

1940
01:21:17,720 --> 01:21:20,120
Every dirty bit of it.

1941
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:24,040
I love your, uh, stories.

1942
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:26,480
Yes. They can go long, but... It's okay.

1943
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:28,640
...I try to finish strong. Always entertaining.

1944
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:32,120
And I love that you...

1945
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:35,120
Love that you read the index cards.

1946
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:37,480
Of course.

1947
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:41,440
And I love that you secretly

1948
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:45,280
have a huge heart,

1949
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:51,080
and it's just filled with kindness

1950
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:54,800
and humility.

1951
01:21:55,240 --> 01:21:56,560
And blood?

1952
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:58,960
I'm sure there's blood.

1953
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:04,600
I don't know, I...

1954
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:10,480
I just think you're a really nice
person and I really like...

1955
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:14,480
I really love spending time with you.

1956
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:17,760
That's good enough for me right there.

1957
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:19,120
Yeah, game over.

1958
01:22:20,120 --> 01:22:21,640
Danny?

1959
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:23,960
Game back on? We gotta...

1960
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:25,320
Um...

1961
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:28,480
Well, I'd like to start off by saying

1962
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:32,520
that I love the most that you fixed your teeth.

1963
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:34,520
Why did I know that...

1964
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:36,960
They were horrible, I agree.

1965
01:22:38,360 --> 01:22:39,920
No, no. Um...

1966
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:42,680
You know what I love? Mmm-hmm?

1967
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:45,520
How you just do everything for everybody else

1968
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:47,320
and you never expect anything back.

1969
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:51,640
In fact, when I say thank you, I don't
know, do you hear that or not?

1970
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:53,880
It's cute.

1971
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:55,520
And I love...

1972
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:58,200
I just love...

1973
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:03,160
You're the only person I've never lied to in my life.

1974
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:05,000
I swear to God.

1975
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:09,200
I just trust you more than anybody in the world.

1976
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:11,400
You know every secret about me.

1977
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:16,880
I love your smile.

1978
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:19,560
That smile is the magic.

1979
01:23:20,240 --> 01:23:22,600
When I'm in the operating room all I think about is,

1980
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:26,720
"All right, 20 more minutes, I get to see the smile."

1981
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:28,720
It's just like...

1982
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:32,240
It starts my day, that smile.

1983
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:41,960
I won best smile at our sorority

1984
01:23:42,040 --> 01:23:44,000
three years straight, right, Katherine?

1985
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:47,400
Not little Bucky here.

1986
01:23:53,080 --> 01:23:56,760
Okay, here we go! Hi, yes! Wee!

1987
01:23:56,880 --> 01:23:58,520
We do the sheep dance, right?

1988
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:00,400
We want to live and dance more, yes.

1989
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:02,720
Okay, all right. Here we go. Eat some food.

1990
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:04,880
Eat the food. Come on, here we go.

1991
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:06,040
Couple more zings.

1992
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:07,960
Make the milk. Yes, he makes the milk.

1993
01:24:08,040 --> 01:24:10,360
You love it. You give milk to the baby.

1994
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:13,440
All right. One, two, three, here we go!

1995
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:15,640
Come on!

1996
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:17,480
We got a couple things that I know how to do!

1997
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:20,760
Yes, this is a good test, so why not?

1998
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:23,560
All right. Here we go.

1999
01:24:25,640 --> 01:24:27,120
You're killing him!

2000
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:39,320
The sheep lives! The sheep lives!

2001
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:41,120
Yes! Here we go, one more time.

2002
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:42,640
Here we go. Yes!

2003
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:45,960
This is what I did. You saw this. Yes!

2004
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Welcome. I am Tanner Patrick, Jr.

2005
01:24:48,120 --> 01:24:52,600
We're ready for the legendary
Oceano's Hula Competition.

2006
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:54,240
Legendary? Never heard of it!

2007
01:24:56,120 --> 01:24:58,760
Legendary like the day you were once sober. So...

2008
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:02,440
She talks the talk, who will walk the walk

2009
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:05,360
and walk with me to the Ladies' Lounge? Feeling it...

2010
01:25:05,480 --> 01:25:07,440
I think you should do it, Devlin.

2011
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:09,040
Because she would win.

2012
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:13,640
I'll do it! Oh! Good show!

2013
01:25:13,720 --> 01:25:15,840
Katherine? How about you?

2014
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,720
Come on, this isn't Katherine's thing. Right, Katherine?

2015
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:22,560
No, no, not my... Her speed. Not mine.

2016
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:24,400
Some people are just more comfortable

2017
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:26,400
on the sidelines, so don't judge her, honey.

2018
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:29,840
Your honesty, your fearlessness, and your tickle spot.

2019
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:33,240
Your creativity, your bravery, and your taffy nipples.

2020
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:36,520
Let's go! How do I win this thing?

2021
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:38,640
I'm gonna do this hula thing.

2022
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:40,320
Oh, don't feel any pressure, Katherine.

2023
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:42,680
I'm not the one who should feel the pressure.

2024
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:50,080
Ladies and gentlemen, a warm welcome
for tonight's hula girls.

2025
01:25:54,640 --> 01:25:56,920
These are my stars. And here's the key,

2026
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,400
you decide how brightly they shine tonight.

2027
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:01,560
You the audience, judge and jury.

2028
01:26:01,640 --> 01:26:03,200
I like what I see.

2029
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:08,560
This is my hula palooza.

2030
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:10,640
You're the judges.

2031
01:26:10,720 --> 01:26:14,040
You're voting for your favorite hula girl.

2032
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:16,000
How about we do one over here?

2033
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:18,480
Can I get a little something-something
up here in the corner?

2034
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:22,840
Has anybody got a conscience here tonight?

2035
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:24,760
Come on, you did well. You did well.

2036
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:26,280
Aw!

2037
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:27,840
It's tough.

2038
01:26:28,240 --> 01:26:29,920
What do I got over here? Anybody?

2039
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:32,960
How tall do you think that guy is?

2040
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:34,960
Who? The Tanner guy? I don't know.

2041
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:36,160
Yeah, that Tanner.

2042
01:26:36,240 --> 01:26:38,000
Looks pretty tall, I'd say he's like 6'3".

2043
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:39,200
Yeah, I don't know.

2044
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:41,200
Can I get a positive reaction?

2045
01:26:42,760 --> 01:26:43,960
Thank you.

2046
01:26:44,640 --> 01:26:48,400
How about this little girl? Let's
make her night. How about it?

2047
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:50,680
I like it. Keep the mojo going.

2048
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:52,280
How about Big Country in the corner?

2049
01:26:52,480 --> 01:26:53,720
Do I got...

2050
01:26:55,560 --> 01:26:56,560
Sorry.

2051
01:26:56,640 --> 01:26:57,960
This is fixed!

2052
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:00,960
Tall fellow is lucky to get away.

2053
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:03,440
Let's pick up the tempo, boys.

2054
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:04,960
What? What is that?

2055
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:10,600
Okay. This is a lot faster.

2056
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:45,160
Fabulous!

2057
01:27:56,680 --> 01:27:58,280
Yeah, baby!

2058
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:17,200
What?

2059
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:20,000
Come on.

2060
01:28:35,640 --> 01:28:37,400
Nobody got cheated here tonight.

2061
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:39,120
These are two of the hottest chicks

2062
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:40,960
we have ever had up here.

2063
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:42,400
But our job is not done.

2064
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:46,320
I need your help, because I need a winner.

2065
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:47,480
Let me hear you.

2066
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:50,400
Beautiful!

2067
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:52,760
Wow, that is gonna be tough to beat.

2068
01:28:52,840 --> 01:28:55,680
Let's not kid anybody. How about over here?

2069
01:28:58,680 --> 01:29:01,400
There you have it. We have ourselves...

2070
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:04,400
That's my Boo-Boo!

2071
01:29:05,720 --> 01:29:08,040
A tie! We have ourselves a tie.

2072
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:10,400
That's great. We both win. Good...

2073
01:29:10,720 --> 01:29:12,040
What's the tiebreaker?

2074
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:15,200
What's the tiebreaker?

2075
01:29:17,240 --> 01:29:19,440
This is how we settle ties in my house.

2076
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:21,600
It's something I like to call Coconut Smoochie.

2077
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:23,200
The object of the game is,

2078
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:25,280
the coconut is in their midsections.

2079
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:27,160
It must move all the way up to their mouths

2080
01:29:27,240 --> 01:29:28,360
without the use of their hands.

2081
01:29:28,440 --> 01:29:29,520
Focus, focus.

2082
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:33,080
If you touch the coconut, you are disqualified.

2083
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:36,880
Okay. Ready? One, two, three, get coconutty!

2084
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:38,920
Okay. Slow.

2085
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:43,160
Okay, all right. Calm down, calm down.

2086
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:44,440
Let me just bring it up to you.

2087
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:45,520
Okay, do it.

2088
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,920
Get it up there. Come on.

2089
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:49,440
Bring your coconuts down to me.

2090
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:50,960
Okay. Oh, my coconuts.

2091
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:52,760
Pull up. All right. I'm so low.

2092
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:55,280
Squeeze your coconuts. Squeeze them.

2093
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:58,440
Use every crevice you can. Don't be afraid.

2094
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:00,040
I can't get it up here.

2095
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:01,440
I'm trying.

2096
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:03,440
Would you be quiet?

2097
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:05,480
Stay there. Wait.

2098
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:07,720
Okay, that's good. Is that good?

2099
01:30:08,120 --> 01:30:09,400
Sorry about this, by the way.

2100
01:30:09,480 --> 01:30:10,800
Really? You're really sorry about this?

2101
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:12,320
No, I'm not. I like it.

2102
01:30:14,160 --> 01:30:15,280
Oh, yeah!

2103
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:16,520
Pick it up, pick it up!

2104
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:18,440
Not with your hands, you buffoon!

2105
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:19,640
Come on!

2106
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:22,760
Look what he's doing! What happened? I can't see.

2107
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:25,600
Focus. Take it slow, take it slow.

2108
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:27,320
He's got it!

2109
01:30:29,480 --> 01:30:31,800
That's not fair. He can't do that.

2110
01:30:31,960 --> 01:30:33,680
No, that's a clean pick-up right there.

2111
01:30:33,880 --> 01:30:35,600
Okay. Bring it over here.

2112
01:30:36,520 --> 01:30:38,280
Go! Go! Go!

2113
01:30:38,840 --> 01:30:40,120
I got it.

2114
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:45,320
There's still time. Let's go.

2115
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:46,920
You can touch each other,

2116
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:48,480
you cannot touch the coconut.

2117
01:30:48,680 --> 01:30:49,840
Hang on, hang on.

2118
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,080
What's going on? What is that? What do you use?

2119
01:30:53,160 --> 01:30:55,200
What's the hold-up? You still got that perfume on, huh?

2120
01:30:55,320 --> 01:30:56,360
Would you stop it?

2121
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:57,560
Smells good. Come on, let's go.

2122
01:30:57,680 --> 01:30:59,680
Have you got it to your mouth yet, Boo-Boo?

2123
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:03,400
Stop putting your ass in my face.

2124
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:06,000
I like it. That's my girl. Okay.

2125
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:12,160
We've got a winner! We have
a winner! We have a winner.

2126
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:15,520
Coconut Smoochie champions right here.

2127
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:17,680
Awesome.

2128
01:31:17,720 --> 01:31:19,720
You suck at everything!

2129
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:22,160
Boo-Boo.

2130
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:23,840
Great teamwork, guys.

2131
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:25,280
How long have you two been married?

2132
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:27,120
Eight years. Ten years.

2133
01:31:27,200 --> 01:31:28,600
Ten years. Eight.

2134
01:31:28,720 --> 01:31:30,400
Very long time. A very long time.

2135
01:31:30,720 --> 01:31:30,760
Did you see the look
on her face? DANNY: Yes.

2136
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:32,840
Did you see the look
on her face? DANNY: Yes.

2137
01:31:32,920 --> 01:31:35,080
Do you understand what joy that brought me?

2138
01:31:35,200 --> 01:31:36,520
How about the look on her face

2139
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:37,840
when you were doing the juggling, though?

2140
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:39,240
The juggling was the highlight for me.

2141
01:31:39,320 --> 01:31:40,800
That was pretty good. You liked that?

2142
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:41,960
It was so cute.

2143
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:44,280
And when you talked about her arms getting done?

2144
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:46,120
The good news is she's beating the hell

2145
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:47,400
out of the iPod guy right now.

2146
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:48,600
Right now, I know.

2147
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:52,200
That was good. That was really fun.

2148
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:54,880
You know what, I think that was the first time

2149
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:56,400
that you and I have ever

2150
01:31:57,560 --> 01:32:00,760
gone out, you know, just us.

2151
01:32:00,920 --> 01:32:02,240
I know. I do.

2152
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:03,920
I feel bad for the Soul Patch now.

2153
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:05,640
I do.

2154
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:07,240
Now that you've been out with a real man.

2155
01:32:07,400 --> 01:32:09,680
And by a real man, I mean a man who showers.

2156
01:32:11,960 --> 01:32:14,680
I think it's so adorable

2157
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:17,240
how obsessed you are with this guy.

2158
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:19,520
I just can't picture you guys on
a date, you know what I mean?

2159
01:32:19,720 --> 01:32:21,400
Who said it was a date ever?

2160
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:22,920
You. You.

2161
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:25,240
You get very excited when you talk to this man.

2162
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:29,280
Listen, Dr. Gervitz is moving his
practice to New York City.

2163
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:30,440
Yeah.

2164
01:32:30,520 --> 01:32:33,080
Brian is not gonna go with him, and he...

2165
01:32:33,320 --> 01:32:35,960
He's just been asking me if

2166
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:39,960
I would want to, you know, replace him.

2167
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:41,800
You're going?

2168
01:32:42,440 --> 01:32:43,600
No.

2169
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,440
You can't do that to me.

2170
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:47,600
I just wanted to see how you'd react.

2171
01:32:47,680 --> 01:32:49,960
Look at you. You can't live without me.

2172
01:32:50,120 --> 01:32:51,520
"What do I do? How do I sign it?

2173
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:52,920
"How do I pay for it?"

2174
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,840
No. You kind of played with me a little bit, though.

2175
01:32:55,960 --> 01:32:58,640
You could've told me that earlier.

2176
01:32:58,720 --> 01:33:00,160
You're just messing with me?

2177
01:33:00,240 --> 01:33:02,000
Trying to get me a little jealous, weren't you?

2178
01:33:02,120 --> 01:33:04,960
No. I just was having fun teasing you.

2179
01:33:05,160 --> 01:33:07,600
That was fun. Why? Were you jealous?

2180
01:33:08,120 --> 01:33:11,440
No. Get outta here. Was I jealous? No.

2181
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:15,240
Look at you. You're grinning, you
can't stop, what is that smile?

2182
01:33:15,320 --> 01:33:16,800
I didn't know you had that many teeth.

2183
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:19,600
I know. I got like 55 teeth.

2184
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:23,240
No. So there's nothing?

2185
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:26,000
You and... There's nothing?

2186
01:33:26,320 --> 01:33:27,480
No love connection?

2187
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:29,880
No. Mmm-mmm. Nothing.

2188
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,040
Well, then, that's a shame.

2189
01:33:32,240 --> 01:33:33,280
What?

2190
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:36,360
That coconut getting in the way tonight.

2191
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:37,800
That's a shame, don't you think? Oh.

2192
01:33:37,960 --> 01:33:39,520
No. No, that was bad.

2193
01:33:39,720 --> 01:33:40,760
The coconut.

2194
01:33:40,840 --> 01:33:42,000
You're lucky that coconut was there.

2195
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:45,160
You couldn't... You wouldn't
have been able to handle it.

2196
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:47,000
Maybe you're right.

2197
01:33:50,040 --> 01:33:52,840
You got more tricks that I don't know about?

2198
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:54,120
I don't know.

2199
01:33:54,200 --> 01:33:55,360
Okay.

2200
01:33:55,560 --> 01:33:57,760
I don't know anything.

2201
01:33:58,480 --> 01:33:59,520
Mommy? Mommy?

2202
01:34:01,400 --> 01:34:02,960
Hi, guys!

2203
01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:04,840
Hey! What're you doing?

2204
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:06,800
The babysitter fell asleep.

2205
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:08,040
Oh, great.

2206
01:34:08,200 --> 01:34:09,320
I mean, come on,

2207
01:34:09,400 --> 01:34:11,040
it's like a Hawaiian Rosa, huh?

2208
01:34:11,880 --> 01:34:13,200
Is it? Oh, my God.

2209
01:34:13,400 --> 01:34:14,520
Yeah, that's asleep.

2210
01:34:14,600 --> 01:34:15,680
Look at that.

2211
01:34:20,200 --> 01:34:22,040
Wow. KATHERINE: She's out deep.

2212
01:34:22,240 --> 01:34:23,680
All right. Good to see you guys.

2213
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:25,240
Good night.

2214
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:27,760
Good job. One more day of lying, guys.

2215
01:34:27,880 --> 01:34:29,720
We're almost done. Home stretch.

2216
01:34:29,880 --> 01:34:32,600
All right. So, you gotta go to sleep.

2217
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:34,240
Yeah.

2218
01:34:34,360 --> 01:34:36,200
Tired? Yes. Good night.

2219
01:34:36,360 --> 01:34:38,080
Okay. That was fun. Good job.

2220
01:34:40,120 --> 01:34:41,600
Good night. Good night.

2221
01:34:41,960 --> 01:34:43,560
Good night. All right.

2222
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:44,760
Okay, Danny.

2223
01:34:45,400 --> 01:34:47,400
Okay, good luck. I'll see you in the morning.

2224
01:35:09,720 --> 01:35:11,880
She ain't going to sleep.

2225
01:35:21,640 --> 01:35:25,280
Hello! There he is, Danny!

2226
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:26,600
It's nice to meet you.

2227
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:27,920
Where were you going?

2228
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:29,000
What?

2229
01:35:29,120 --> 01:35:31,000
I was going... I was going to...

2230
01:35:31,160 --> 01:35:32,200
Where were you guys?

2231
01:35:32,280 --> 01:35:33,440
I was looking for you guys at...

2232
01:35:33,640 --> 01:35:35,120
What happened? How was the dinner?

2233
01:35:36,280 --> 01:35:39,800
Dolph gave mouth- to-mouth to a sheep.

2234
01:35:39,960 --> 01:35:41,440
Yeah. And then we had a few drinks.

2235
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:45,680
Yes. It was choking and so I gave him sheep-P-R.

2236
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:50,120
But he was the black sheep of the family,

2237
01:35:50,320 --> 01:35:54,320
but he was also white, if that makes any sense.

2238
01:35:55,120 --> 01:35:57,600
And we've been talking about how
amazing this trip has been

2239
01:35:57,680 --> 01:35:59,560
and how amazing you are.

2240
01:35:59,640 --> 01:36:01,160
Yeah, all joking aside,

2241
01:36:01,240 --> 01:36:03,000
it really has been first-class.

2242
01:36:03,200 --> 01:36:06,200
And that, if the kids and I hadn't kept you so busy,

2243
01:36:06,360 --> 01:36:08,360
that you might've had the time to do something

2244
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:10,200
you've been thinking about doing?

2245
01:36:10,360 --> 01:36:12,360
The one ringy-dingy?

2246
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:15,480
Uh... Yeah, you told her about that?

2247
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,640
I don't need you to get me a ring, Danny.

2248
01:36:18,720 --> 01:36:21,040
Let's just get married. Right here.

2249
01:36:21,560 --> 01:36:22,640
What now?

2250
01:36:22,720 --> 01:36:26,480
Why not? We're in Hawaii. Let's do it tomorrow.

2251
01:36:26,920 --> 01:36:29,560
I mean, this has felt special from
the moment that we met.

2252
01:36:29,640 --> 01:36:31,600
And I've seen the way that you are with the kids,

2253
01:36:31,680 --> 01:36:34,440
and it's exactly the way I always
imagined my husband would be.

2254
01:36:34,520 --> 01:36:36,400
Oh, man...

2255
01:36:36,720 --> 01:36:38,600
I don't wanna wait.

2256
01:36:38,640 --> 01:36:40,520
I just wanna start my life with you.

2257
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:45,240
Hi!

2258
01:36:47,720 --> 01:36:50,920
Hi, everybody! Dolph.

2259
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:52,480
There you are.

2260
01:36:52,520 --> 01:36:54,600
I have been looking everywhere for you.

2261
01:36:54,760 --> 01:36:58,320
For me? Yes. Come here. Come on, let's go.

2262
01:36:58,400 --> 01:37:00,520
No way, we can't go. What?

2263
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:02,160
My little Oompa Loompa.

2264
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:07,360
Danny and Palmer, they're getting married tomorrow!

2265
01:37:08,600 --> 01:37:09,880
What?

2266
01:37:09,960 --> 01:37:11,600
No, no, I mean, why?

2267
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:13,840
Yeah, we are. But what do you think?

2268
01:37:14,040 --> 01:37:15,840
What do you mean, what do I think?

2269
01:37:16,200 --> 01:37:17,960
I mean, what does it matter what I think?

2270
01:37:18,040 --> 01:37:20,640
I think that's great.

2271
01:37:20,720 --> 01:37:22,360
Thank you, Devlin.

2272
01:37:22,720 --> 01:37:24,440
I really hope that you can be there tomorrow.

2273
01:37:24,920 --> 01:37:26,040
I can't.

2274
01:37:26,200 --> 01:37:27,880
It's really...

2275
01:37:27,960 --> 01:37:30,920
It's bad luck for the ex to be at the wedding.

2276
01:37:31,080 --> 01:37:32,200
Come on, Dolph. Let's go.

2277
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:34,320
Where are we going? They are here.

2278
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:35,560
We gotta have the sweet sex.

2279
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:37,080
What? Okay? Come on.

2280
01:37:37,240 --> 01:37:39,920
Okay. Congratulations, though.

2281
01:37:57,320 --> 01:37:58,920
I'm trying them on as we speak.

2282
01:37:59,120 --> 01:38:00,320
I know, but I just bought them.

2283
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:04,280
I had some with me and the one
I have on is pretty amazing.

2284
01:39:11,400 --> 01:39:13,560
Michael!

2285
01:39:16,040 --> 01:39:17,400
Nincompoop!

2286
01:39:18,840 --> 01:39:20,560
Nincompoopenschtic!

2287
01:39:20,720 --> 01:39:23,400
Michael, the crap is the stinking...

2288
01:39:39,200 --> 01:39:40,480
Hello?

2289
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:42,320
Hey, you up?

2290
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:46,560
Hi. Yeah. Glad you called.

2291
01:39:47,720 --> 01:39:48,920
Are you?

2292
01:39:49,880 --> 01:39:50,920
Um...

2293
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,840
Yeah, I was, uh, just checking flights

2294
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:57,440
for your parents tomorrow and I found...

2295
01:39:57,600 --> 01:40:00,000
No, no, no. You don't have to do that.

2296
01:40:00,560 --> 01:40:02,240
Her parents aren't coming in

2297
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:04,760
and she wants it to be kind of elope-y.

2298
01:40:05,400 --> 01:40:06,760
Elope-y.

2299
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:08,600
Got it.

2300
01:40:08,680 --> 01:40:10,640
Okay, uh, so, are you all set

2301
01:40:10,720 --> 01:40:12,720
for what you need to wear tomorrow?

2302
01:40:13,400 --> 01:40:16,000
Do you think this is a good idea?

2303
01:40:16,760 --> 01:40:18,680
What? The wedding?

2304
01:40:19,120 --> 01:40:23,120
Yeah, the wedding... Just the whole Palmer thing.

2305
01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:29,120
Well, that's why we came out here, right?

2306
01:40:29,800 --> 01:40:31,280
I guess.

2307
01:40:32,440 --> 01:40:33,960
You don't think it's crazy?

2308
01:40:38,120 --> 01:40:42,400
Um, Danny, you don't need my permission.

2309
01:40:43,760 --> 01:40:45,760
Okay? You're a big boy.

2310
01:40:45,960 --> 01:40:47,480
I know, I just...

2311
01:40:51,640 --> 01:40:54,040
I know if I do this that...

2312
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:58,000
Just, things could get weird

2313
01:40:58,080 --> 01:41:00,400
between you and me at the office, so...

2314
01:41:01,480 --> 01:41:04,000
Well, you're not gonna have to worry about that.

2315
01:41:06,320 --> 01:41:08,160
You going to New York?

2316
01:41:08,320 --> 01:41:11,360
Yeah. I just, you know, I mean...

2317
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,840
As much as I was looking forward to you, um,

2318
01:41:15,680 --> 01:41:18,080
reconstructing my face,

2319
01:41:19,640 --> 01:41:22,520
I really just need to start fresh, you know?

2320
01:41:25,320 --> 01:41:27,160
Hello, are you there?

2321
01:41:28,080 --> 01:41:29,640
You understand?

2322
01:41:30,840 --> 01:41:32,320
I guess.

2323
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:36,680
It's an awful lot of guessing
coming through this phone.

2324
01:41:38,200 --> 01:41:40,040
I've been divorced, I have two kids,

2325
01:41:40,120 --> 01:41:42,040
I don't have time for guessing.

2326
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:48,440
Got a big day tomorrow, Doc, all right?

2327
01:41:48,560 --> 01:41:51,440
So why don't you just get yourself some sleep?

2328
01:42:05,880 --> 01:42:08,040
So that's it. You have nothing else to worry about.

2329
01:42:08,200 --> 01:42:10,240
We have the flowers, the music and the location,

2330
01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:12,640
which is ha-wowie, by the way, you're gonna love it.

2331
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:14,920
I promise you it is going to be

2332
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:17,960
the most wonderful day of your life, guaranteed.

2333
01:42:18,200 --> 01:42:19,960
Devlin. Yeah.

2334
01:42:20,080 --> 01:42:21,320
Oh! Palmer! I didn't...

2335
01:42:25,080 --> 01:42:29,320
Well, you just look absolutely beautiful.

2336
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:31,800
Really? Thank you. Yes.

2337
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:34,080
Devlin, can I ask you something?

2338
01:42:34,160 --> 01:42:35,240
'Course.

2339
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:38,480
Do you still want to be with Danny?

2340
01:42:40,080 --> 01:42:41,160
Wait. What?

2341
01:42:41,240 --> 01:42:42,800
Because I think that

2342
01:42:44,600 --> 01:42:47,840
he still may be in love with you.

2343
01:42:49,320 --> 01:42:50,560
Really?

2344
01:42:52,680 --> 01:42:54,760
Why would you think that?

2345
01:42:55,240 --> 01:42:58,240
He's always glowing when you're around.

2346
01:42:58,400 --> 01:43:01,680
And he laughs at your jokes. He doesn't laugh at mine.

2347
01:43:01,840 --> 01:43:06,240
Palmer, trust me, there is nothing
between me and Danny.

2348
01:43:06,520 --> 01:43:08,280
We're just, you know,

2349
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:10,080
we're familiar.

2350
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:13,280
And you are the girl for him.

2351
01:43:14,280 --> 01:43:15,760
He even told me that last night.

2352
01:43:16,440 --> 01:43:19,440
My God, Devlin, this is such a relief

2353
01:43:19,800 --> 01:43:23,440
because I could never stand a
chance going up against you.

2354
01:43:23,600 --> 01:43:25,480
Turn around. Tell me if this fits.

2355
01:43:25,640 --> 01:43:27,680
Put the hanger up your nose.

2356
01:43:27,760 --> 01:43:28,880
Stop!

2357
01:43:39,880 --> 01:43:41,160
Excuse me.

2358
01:43:41,320 --> 01:43:42,720
Here you go. Thank you.

2359
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:44,160
Katherine!

2360
01:43:44,400 --> 01:43:45,840
Katherine! Oh, Devlin.

2361
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:47,640
That was so much fun last night.

2362
01:43:47,720 --> 01:43:48,800
I know.

2363
01:43:49,160 --> 01:43:52,160
I am still trying to work out how you cheated.

2364
01:43:52,840 --> 01:43:55,240
I didn't. That's what happened.

2365
01:43:55,480 --> 01:43:57,680
So, where's Danny?

2366
01:43:59,800 --> 01:44:01,000
Devlin...

2367
01:44:01,800 --> 01:44:04,800
Danny's at his wedding.

2368
01:44:05,320 --> 01:44:06,480
Come again?

2369
01:44:06,640 --> 01:44:08,160
I was never married to him.

2370
01:44:09,520 --> 01:44:11,360
All a big lie that I made up.

2371
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:12,760
Why?

2372
01:44:13,360 --> 01:44:18,000
'Cause I couldn't stand the thought
of you knowing the truth.

2373
01:44:18,040 --> 01:44:19,160
Really?

2374
01:44:19,640 --> 01:44:22,320
So, yeah, I'm a single mother.

2375
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:24,400
I have two kids that I love

2376
01:44:24,480 --> 01:44:25,880
more than anything in the world.

2377
01:44:26,040 --> 01:44:29,920
I drive a Honda. Still have dial-up internet.

2378
01:44:30,520 --> 01:44:34,200
I got a 2.7 GPA in college, not a 3.4.

2379
01:44:34,960 --> 01:44:36,200
And while I'm at it telling the truth,

2380
01:44:37,040 --> 01:44:38,400
I named my kids' poop after you.

2381
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:43,000
And I work for Danny. I'm his assistant.

2382
01:44:43,040 --> 01:44:44,200
That's it.

2383
01:44:44,680 --> 01:44:48,000
Really, I would never have guessed this.

2384
01:44:48,040 --> 01:44:49,840
I mean, you two had a real connection.

2385
01:44:51,040 --> 01:44:54,520
He's great. He's the greatest guy.

2386
01:44:56,480 --> 01:44:59,120
And I might even be in love with him,

2387
01:45:00,200 --> 01:45:02,120
but that doesn't really matter at this moment

2388
01:45:02,240 --> 01:45:06,600
because he is getting married
to another person right now.

2389
01:45:08,920 --> 01:45:10,720
lan and I are breaking up.

2390
01:45:11,560 --> 01:45:14,760
What? What happened?

2391
01:45:16,080 --> 01:45:18,240
Well, for starters, he's gay.

2392
01:45:18,400 --> 01:45:19,520
He's gay?

2393
01:45:19,600 --> 01:45:21,160
I mean, look at him.

2394
01:45:21,320 --> 01:45:23,320
That's a strong muscle right there.

2395
01:45:23,400 --> 01:45:24,880
I'm squeezing.

2396
01:45:25,440 --> 01:45:26,840
Devlin, I gotta tell you,

2397
01:45:26,920 --> 01:45:29,800
last night, with the ass grab of the coconut,

2398
01:45:29,880 --> 01:45:31,880
little bit of a red flag.

2399
01:45:33,560 --> 01:45:35,600
I've seen him do that with the soap.

2400
01:45:42,360 --> 01:45:43,920
What about the iPod?

2401
01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:45,760
Oh, he didn't invent shit.

2402
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:47,080
He didn't?

2403
01:45:47,240 --> 01:45:49,800
No! He made his money suing the Dodgers

2404
01:45:49,880 --> 01:45:52,000
after he got hit by a foul ball.

2405
01:45:53,360 --> 01:45:56,800
Oh, God! That's so... What?

2406
01:45:57,800 --> 01:45:59,440
Well, this is different.

2407
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:04,520
Yeah, why didn't we try this truth-telling thing before?

2408
01:46:05,120 --> 01:46:06,360
I don't know.

2409
01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:09,080
Hey. Hey.

2410
01:46:10,360 --> 01:46:11,360
What?

2411
01:46:11,440 --> 01:46:12,680
That's nice.

2412
01:46:12,760 --> 01:46:14,960
It's nice to tell the truth. That's good.

2413
01:46:15,160 --> 01:46:16,560
The truth is fun, isn't it?

2414
01:46:16,720 --> 01:46:18,120
Like, were you telling the truth

2415
01:46:18,160 --> 01:46:19,880
when you said you might be in love with me?

2416
01:46:20,640 --> 01:46:22,440
I'm gonna leave you two. Okay.

2417
01:46:22,600 --> 01:46:24,480
I'm gonna go get a divorce. Good luck.

2418
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,440
Wait, where are my kids?

2419
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:35,280
Palmer took them out for ice cream.

2420
01:46:36,080 --> 01:46:38,400
So, how was the wedding?

2421
01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:39,840
Okay. All right.

2422
01:46:39,880 --> 01:46:43,880
So, we're standing on top of this beautiful cliff. Uh-huh.

2423
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:47,240
I start looking out into the Pacific,

2424
01:46:47,320 --> 01:46:48,880
and I think to myself,

2425
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:53,760
"Wow. I am about to start my life

2426
01:46:54,360 --> 01:46:55,880
"with the one I love."

2427
01:46:57,680 --> 01:46:59,640
And the only problem was,

2428
01:46:59,720 --> 01:47:02,160
the one I love was not with me.

2429
01:47:03,480 --> 01:47:04,560
She wasn't?

2430
01:47:04,640 --> 01:47:05,840
She was not.

2431
01:47:06,840 --> 01:47:08,640
So you didn't?

2432
01:47:08,840 --> 01:47:10,040
I couldn't.

2433
01:47:10,080 --> 01:47:11,320
You couldn't.

2434
01:47:11,920 --> 01:47:16,320
I mean, don't we have something extra

2435
01:47:16,360 --> 01:47:17,720
happening with us?

2436
01:47:19,520 --> 01:47:21,040
Danny, I...

2437
01:47:23,360 --> 01:47:26,720
What happens when we're not on fake-cation

2438
01:47:26,760 --> 01:47:29,960
and you wake up and realize this is real?

2439
01:47:30,120 --> 01:47:33,040
You are the only real thing I've ever had in my life.

2440
01:47:33,240 --> 01:47:35,400
Danny, come on, man. I don't...

2441
01:47:35,560 --> 01:47:38,600
She's beautiful and she's... I'm not twenty-three.

2442
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:42,360
I'm not that.

2443
01:47:42,560 --> 01:47:44,480
She's good, she's very nice,

2444
01:47:44,520 --> 01:47:47,240
there's only one problem. She's not you.

2445
01:47:47,480 --> 01:47:48,560
She's not you.

2446
01:47:49,560 --> 01:47:51,240
I have two kids.

2447
01:47:51,560 --> 01:47:54,920
I can't just drive them off a cliff. You know?

2448
01:47:55,360 --> 01:47:56,680
I love those kids

2449
01:47:56,760 --> 01:47:58,800
more than anything in the world, Guv'nor.

2450
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:03,800
No, I wanna be with those guys like 23 hours a day.

2451
01:48:04,200 --> 01:48:06,040
What about the other hour?

2452
01:48:17,440 --> 01:48:18,760
Good job!

2453
01:48:18,920 --> 01:48:20,480
That's what I'm talking about.

2454
01:48:20,560 --> 01:48:21,920
Whatever!

2455
01:48:26,600 --> 01:48:27,880
Well, everything turned out

2456
01:48:27,960 --> 01:48:30,120
pretty good for everybody.

2457
01:48:30,280 --> 01:48:33,160
Squirt got to swim with the dolphins.

2458
01:48:36,360 --> 01:48:39,640
Palmer met some tennis player her
own age on the plane ride home,

2459
01:48:39,760 --> 01:48:42,120
who's an even bigger fan of 'N Sync.

2460
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:46,440
And Maggie's about to start a three-week acting class

2461
01:48:46,520 --> 01:48:48,760
with the actual Dolph Lundgren.

2462
01:48:49,880 --> 01:48:51,800
And what happened for me?

2463
01:48:52,080 --> 01:48:55,280
Well, I'm finally wearing my wedding ring for real.

2464
01:48:55,480 --> 01:48:57,360
And now when women ask me about it,

2465
01:48:57,520 --> 01:48:59,640
I'm gonna tell them I'm married to a woman

2466
01:48:59,720 --> 01:49:02,440
who doesn't beat me, doesn't cheat on me,

2467
01:49:02,640 --> 01:49:05,560
doesn't drink... Well, doesn't drink that much.

2468
01:49:05,640 --> 01:49:08,520
And who I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with.

2469
01:49:08,600 --> 01:49:11,360
A woman named Katherine.

2470
01:49:11,440 --> 01:49:14,720
Would you like to dance with
your wife, Doctor Maccabee?

2471
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,040
Yes, I would, Mrs. Maccabee.

2472
01:49:17,320 --> 01:49:18,400
Yeah, it's okay.

2473
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:22,160
One more.

2474
01:49:27,600 --> 01:49:30,520
You were right, Soul Patch is going hard on that bass.

2475
01:49:30,680 --> 01:49:32,240
What did I tell you? Uh-huh.

2476
01:49:35,600 --> 01:49:38,000
Hey. Encore, man. I'm just kidding. Stop.

2477
01:49:43,160 --> 01:49:45,360
I get it. It is long and it's gross.

2478
01:49:45,520 --> 01:49:48,200
You don't need wind for that thing to swing around.
