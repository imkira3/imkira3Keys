Mm-hm.

Hypothetically, if we could do it and none
of us get caught, would you guys do it?

- No.
- I would.

- No, you wouldn't.
- I would.

- You would?
KURT: Yeah.

00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:23,671
It's not murder if it's justified.
Justifiable homicide, right?

for the greater good, so be it.

monster. He's a fucking jerk.

killing thousands of innocent Bolivians.

Technically, I think it's immoral
not to kill him.

458
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:43,627
I should kill Harken for not letting me
say goodbye to Gam Gam?

00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:45,763
Yes. Yes, you should.

Julia is ruining your life, you know?
That's wrong.

- That is wrong.
- It's affecting your possible marriage.

- Come on, she's not ruining it.
- Would your life be easier without Julia?

You're right.
Uh, know what I'm gonna do?

maybe I'll slash her up...

...and I'll put her in a box and I'll mail it
to you two, uh, tough-guy mafiosos.

paying for dinner because you've upset me.

JULIA: I invited her.
- Yes. She called.

477
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:39,249
And she said that now that we're engaged,
she wanted to offer me free dental work.
