1
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,220
I got nothing, Sir.

2
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,750
No sign of Niobe or Ghost.

3
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,810
Nothin' but blue pills.

4
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,540
Should we jack in and try to contact them?

5
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,810
It won't matter, my gut says they're down.

6
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:32,250
Then we should start back. No, if that ship can still fly, we need it.

7
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:33,610
I was afraid you were gonna say that.

8
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:37,420
Search every pipe, every hole, every crack we know. Sweep as wide as possible...

9
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:38,660
...as fast as possible.

10
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,920
Captain, these lines are crawling with calamari.

11
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:43,550
The sooner we find them, the better.

12
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,660
Thought you could use something to eat

13
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,060
Thank you

14
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,100
Any change?

15
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,830
No.

16
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,860
How's he? He's gonna be fine.

17
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,550
At least until he wakes up.

18
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,350
What do you mean?

19
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:10,400
Captain has some questions for him.

20
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,020
He had better have some good answers.

21
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,590
You see these cuts?

22
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,270
I think they're self-inflicted.

23
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:18,540
Why? VDTs maybe.

24
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,480
I don't know.

25
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:22,450
But like I said...

26
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,230
The answer had better be good.

27
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:30,120
Roland, I'd like to run another search through the Matrix.

28
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,730
For what?

29
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:32,770
For Neo.

30
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:36,030
How can he be in the Matrix, Sir? He's not plugged in.

31
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,360
Please, for me.

32
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:52,280
This is what keeps bothering me. What?

33
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:57,150
His neural patterns don't read like someone who's in a coma.

34
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,050
The strange thing is, I see these patterns all the time.

35
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,270
Where?

36
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,830
On someone jacked in.

37
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,500
A big bubkis, nada.

38
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,110
He's not in there.

39
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:20,720
Sir, I got the projections. How long?

40
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:23,150
Based on the point of entry and the past speed, it looks...

41
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:25,750
...like the machines will be in Zion in just 20 hours.

42
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,830
Jesus H. Christ.

43
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,210
Alright lets move with a purpose.

44
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,700
AK get upstairs, I want you on holographics.

45
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:37,170
Mauser, I want forward and aft guns manned at all times.

46
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,710
Make sure we're running on as few pads as possible.

47
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:40,360
Yes, Sir.

48
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,360
Hey! Hey!

49
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:43,370
You got a call!

50
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,130
Operator.

51
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:49,800
It's Seraph.

52
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,770
I bring word from the Oracle.

53
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,550
You must come at once.

54
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,630
Good morning.

55
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:10,530
Who are you?

56
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,150
My name is Sati. Your name is Neo.

57
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,600
My papa says you're not supposed to be here.

58
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,550
He says you must be lost. Are you lost Neo?

59
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,540
Where am I?

60
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,350
This is the train station.

61
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,900
But this isn't the Matrix?

62
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,850
That's where the train goes, that's where we're going.

63
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:38,370
But you cannot go with us.

64
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:40,210
Why not?

65
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,680
He won't let you.

66
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,040
Who won't?

67
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,690
The Trainman, I don't like him...

68
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,020
...but my papa says we have to do what the Trainman says.

69
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:54,880
Or else he will leave us here for ever and ever.

70
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:11,050
Morpheus, Trinity.

71
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,760
Thank you for coming.

72
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,700
One thing I've learned in all my years...

73
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,100
...is that nothing ever works out just the way we want it to.

74
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,280
Who are you?

75
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:23,240
I'm the Oracle.

76
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:29,210
I wish there was an easier way to get through this but there ain't.

77
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,630
I'm sorry this had to happen.

78
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:37,020
I'm sorry I couldn't be sitting here like you remember me.

79
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,790
But it wasn't meant to be.

80
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,060
What happened?

81
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:43,630
I made a choice. And that choice cost me more...

82
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,350
...than I wanted it to.

83
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,470
What choice?

84
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,750
To help you, to guide Neo.

85
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,720
Now, since the real test for any choice...

86
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,220
...is having to make the same choice again...

87
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:57,560
...knowing full well what it might cost...

88
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,320
...I guess I feel pretty good about that choice...

89
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:05,990
...'cause here I am, at it again.

90
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,050
Do you know what happened to Neo?

91
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:09,240
Yes.

92
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:14,770
He's trapped in a place between this world and the machine world.

93
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:19,340
The link is controlled by a program called the Trainman.

94
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:23,860
He used to smuggle programs in and out of the Matrix.

95
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:27,830
If he finds out where Neo is before you get to him...

96
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:31,480
...then I'm afraid our choices are going to become difficult.

97
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,320
Why?

98
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,830
Because of who the Trainman works for.

99
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:36,170
The Merovingian.

100
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:41,070
He's placed a bounty on your lives. You must be careful at all times.

101
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:45,930
Seraph knows how to find the Trainman, he'll go with you.

102
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:48,980
For years he has protected me.

103
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:52,770
I hope he can do the same for you.

104
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,010
Please, follow me.

105
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,390
Oracle.

106
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,070
I know Morpheus.

107
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:09,730
I can see you're filled with doubt, clouded by uncertainty.

108
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,030
After everything that has happened...

109
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:14,410
How can you expect me to believe you?

110
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,850
I don't.

111
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,860
I expect just what I've always expected.

112
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:21,770
For you to make up your own damn mind.

113
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,590
Believe me or don't.

114
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,720
All I can do is to tell you that your friend is in trouble...

115
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,580
...and he needs your help.

116
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:31,620
He needs all our help.

117
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,870
Are you from the Matrix?

118
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,550
Yes. No.

119
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,660
I mean I was.

120
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,200
Why did you leave?

121
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:45,700
I had to. I had to leave my home too.

122
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,960
Sati, come here darling.

123
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:49,620
Leave the poor man in peace.

124
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,220
Yes papa.

125
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:58,800
I am sorry, she's still very curious.

126
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:03,680
I know you. Yes, in the restaurant of the Frenchman.

127
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:07,130
I'm Rama-Kandra. This is my wife Kamala.

128
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,610
My daughter Sati.

129
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:11,370
We are most honoured to meet you.

130
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,030
You are programs.

131
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:18,150
Oh yes! I'm the power plant systems manager for recycling operations.

132
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:22,460
My wife is an interactive software programmer. She's highly creative.

133
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:25,120
What are you doing here? You do not belong here.

134
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,550
Kamala! Goodness, I apologize.

135
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,910
My wife can be very direct.

136
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:32,660
It's ok.

137
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:34,790
I don't have an answer.

138
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,620
I don't even know where 'here' is.

139
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:38,570
This place is nowhere.

140
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:41,920
It is between your world and our world.

141
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,260
Who's the Trainman? He works for the Frenchman.

142
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:48,440
Why did I know you were going to say that...

143
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:50,360
The Frenchman does not forget.

144
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,980
And he does not forgive.

145
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,680
You know him? I know only what I need to know.

146
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:59,460
I know that if you want to take something from our world into your world...

147
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,850
...that does not belong there, you must go to the Frenchman.

148
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,090
Is that what you are doing here?

149
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,670
Rama, please! I do not want to be cruel Kamala.

150
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,720
He may never see another face for the rest of his life.

151
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:13,330
I'm sorry.

152
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:15,670
You don't have to answer that question.

153
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:17,140
No, I don't mind.

154
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:19,750
The answer is simple.

155
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,840
I love my daughter very much.

156
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:31,390
I find her to be the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.

157
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,230
But where we're from that is not enough.

158
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,750
Every program that is created must have a purpose.

159
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:40,370
If it does not, it is deleted.

160
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,290
I went to the Frenchman to save my daughter.

161
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:49,890
You do not understand? I just have never...

162
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,970
Heard a program speak of love.

163
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:55,460
It's a human emotion.

164
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:57,070
No, it's a word.

165
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:03,070
What matters is the connection the word implies.

166
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:06,920
I see that you are in love.

167
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:12,060
Can you tell me what you would give to hold on to that connection?

168
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,710
Anything.

169
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:18,480
Then perhaps the reason you're here, isn't so different from the reason I'm here.

170
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,670
That's him.

171
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,860
Get away! Get away from me!

172
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:33,520
We don't want trouble.

173
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,270
Get the hell away from me! We need your help.

174
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:40,020
I can't help you. No one can help you.

175
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:32,100
Oh, no.

176
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,960
Damn it.

177
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,840
When is the train due?

178
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,990
It's already late.

179
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,840
It's not like the Trainman to be late.

180
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:58,250
You think it has something to do with me?

181
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:01,490
I cannot say. Who knows such thing?

182
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:04,160
Only the Oracle. You know the Oracle?

183
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:06,180
Everyone knows the Oracle.

184
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:08,590
I consulted with her before i met with the Frenchman.

185
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:11,580
She promised she would look after Sati after we said goodbye.

186
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,030
Goodbye?

187
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,170
You're not staying with her?

188
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,690
It is not possible.

189
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,300
Our arrangement with the Frenchman was for our daughter only.

190
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:23,170
My wife and I must return to our world.

191
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:24,370
Why?

192
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,070
That is our karma.

193
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,590
You believe in karma?

194
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,330
Karma is a word, like love.

195
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:35,200
A way of saying 'what I'm here to do'.

196
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,230
I do not resent my karma.

197
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:42,570
I'm grateful for it, grateful for my wonderful wife, for my beautiful daughter.

198
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:47,390
They are gifts. And so I do what I must do to honour them.

199
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:51,690
Papa, the train! Yes! Find your bag!

200
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,000
Quickly!

201
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,010
Can I carry that for you?

202
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,120
All right.

203
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:07,600
Hurry it up! I'm late!

204
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,780
Who are you? He is a friend.

205
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:18,050
Rama! I know you.

206
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:21,620
So that's what they wanted.

207
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,570
I need to get back.

208
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,900
I'll pay you whatever you want.

209
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:28,540
One way or another I'm getting on this train.

210
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,800
Oh no, no, no, no, no.

211
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:34,220
You're gonna stay right here until the Merovingian says different.

212
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:39,200
If I know him, you're gonna be here for a long, long time.

213
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:41,410
I don't wanna hurt you.

214
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:46,080
You don't get it. I built this place.

215
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,540
Down here I make the rules. Down here I make the threats.

216
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,610
Down here, I'm God.

217
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:04,980
Get on the train or you're gonna stay here with him.

218
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,920
We should return to the Oracle. She will know what to do.

219
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,170
No.

220
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:28,190
We know what has to be done.

221
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:43,970
Shit!

222
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:14,140
You gotta be kidding.

223
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:17,570
Holy shit. It's wingless.

224
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:22,200
I get it. You must be ready to die.

225
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,260
I need to speak with him.

226
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:26,150
Only way you're getting through this door...

227
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,760
...is over my big dead ass.

228
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,740
So be it.

229
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,070
There are no weapons allowed in the club.

230
00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:00,630
At the bottom of this elevator there is a coat-check girl.

231
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,670
And if we're lucky, one man for checking weapons.

232
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:05,790
And if we're unlucky?

233
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,590
There will be many men.

234
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,210
Can I take your...? Oh my God.

235
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:36,570
What in the hell?

236
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:41,900
I don't believe this.

237
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:48,630
Hey!

238
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,330
Hey!

239
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:58,540
The prodigal child returns. L' ange sans ailes. (The angel without wings)

240
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:02,490
Are you here for the bounty, Seraph?

241
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:07,270
Tell me, how many bullets are there in those guns?

242
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:11,150
I don't know, but I don't think you have enough.

243
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,250
We only want to talk. Oh, yes.

244
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:18,060
I'm sure you do. You have fought through hell to do so.

245
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:20,920
Yes. I'll tell you what I'll do.

246
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,660
Put down the guns and I will promise you a safe passage out of here.

247
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:29,070
All three of us. Oh, yes, yes...

248
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,080
Of course.

249
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:57,350
Quelle bonne surpris, n'est-ce pas? (what a good surprise, isn't it?)

250
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:01,000
Who could have guessed we would all be seeing each other so soon...

251
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:06,230
...after our last meeting? A fate too kind.

252
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:10,400
And since you, my little Judas have brought them here...

253
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,800
...I can only surmise the fortune teller has found herself another shell.

254
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,370
Disappointing.

255
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:18,550
But not unexpected.

256
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:21,680
I do hope, however, she has the good manners to learn her lesson.

257
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:25,230
And to remember there is no action without consequence.

258
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:27,930
And if you take something from me...

259
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:30,700
...you will pay the price.

260
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:33,100
You know why we are here?

261
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:39,940
Come now, what kind of question is this? Of course I know. It's my business to know.

262
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:43,650
Some might think this is a strange coincidence, but I do not.

263
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:46,270
I'm curious, though, as to...

264
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:49,580
...how it actually happened.

265
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,110
Do you know? No.

266
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:53,560
No?

267
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,020
I did not think so.

268
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,770
But it is always best to ask.

269
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:02,130
We want to make a deal.

270
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:09,310
Always straight to business. Uh, Morpheus? Ok.

271
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,510
I have something you want.

272
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:17,790
To make a deal, you must have something I want.

273
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:18,940
Yes?

274
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:24,490
And it so happens there is something I want.

275
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,210
Something I have wanted ever since I first came here.

276
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,940
It is said they cannot be taken.

277
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:35,090
they can only be given.

278
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:37,070
What?

279
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:41,720
The eyes of the Oracle.

280
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,880
I have told you before, there's no escaping the nature of the universe.

281
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:51,700
It is that nature that has again brought you to me.

282
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,710
Where some see coincidence, I see consequence.

283
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:59,620
Where others see chance, I see...

284
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,570
...cost.

285
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:07,230
Bring me the eyes of the Oracle.

286
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:11,150
And I will give you back your saviour.

287
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:15,210
It seems a particularly fair and reasonable deal to me.

288
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:18,660
Yes? No?

289
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:23,000
I don't have time for this shit.

290
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:56,270
You wanna make a deal? How about this?

291
00:22:56,340 --> 00:23:01,210
You give me Neo, or we all die right here, right now.

292
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:04,010
Interesting deal.

293
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:11,480
You are really ready to die for this man?

294
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,050
Believe it.

295
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,860
She'll do it. If she has to she'll kill every one of us.

296
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:22,180
She's in love. It's remarkable how similar...

297
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:24,070
...the pattern of love is...

298
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:26,680
...to the pattern of insanity.

299
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,250
Time's up.

300
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,760
What's it gonna be Merv?

301
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:38,430
Ok, you got yourself in here.

302
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,410
You can get yourself out.

303
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,490
Are you ready for us?

304
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:34,100
Almost, Sir. They got some pretty ancient hacks here, we're working on it.

305
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:34,800
Did you find Neo?

306
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:36,640
Can't you see him? No, Sir.

307
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:39,270
We were reading something but I couldn't tell what it was.

308
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:45,400
I can't leave yet.

309
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:50,210
I have to see her.

310
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,290
Now?

311
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:56,210
It's my last chance.

312
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:00,610
That's it, that's the secret.

313
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,500
You've got to use your hands. Why?

314
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:06,690
Cookies need love, like everything does.

315
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:08,630
Neo.

316
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:13,490
I was hoping to have these done before you got here.

317
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:16,540
Oh, well. Sati, honey...

318
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,740
...I think it's time for a tasting.

319
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,120
Take the bowl to Seraph and find out if they're ready.

320
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:22,690
Ok.

321
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:27,930
I'm glad you got out. Me too.

322
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:32,020
So...

323
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:35,540
Do you recognize me? A part of you.

324
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:38,240
Yeah, that's how it works.

325
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:40,900
Some bits you lose, some bits you keep.

326
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:45,090
I don't yet recognize my face in the mirror, but...

327
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:48,840
...I still love candy.

328
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,490
No, thank you.

329
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:55,630
Remember what you were like when you first walked through my door?

330
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,300
Jittery as a june bug.

331
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,790
And now just look at you.

332
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:04,680
You sure did surprise me, Neo. And you still do.

333
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:07,400
You gave me a few surprises too.

334
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,370
I hope I helped.

335
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:14,060
You helped me to get here, but my question's why.

336
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,040
Where is this going?

337
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:17,440
Where does it end?

338
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:20,660
I don't know. You don't know, or you won't tell me?

339
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:22,770
I told you before...

340
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:26,670
no one can see beyond a choice they don't understand.

341
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:27,540
And I mean no one.

342
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,260
What choice?

343
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:30,780
It doesn't matter.

344
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:34,970
It's my choice. I have mine to make, the same as you have yours.

345
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:38,370
Does that include what things to tell me and what not to tell me?

346
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:39,410
Of course not.

347
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:41,480
Then why didn't you tell me about the architect?

348
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:44,300
Why didn't you tell me about Zion, the Ones before me?

349
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:46,120
Why didn't you tell me the truth?

350
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,070
Because it wasn't time for you to know.

351
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,970
Who decided it wasn't time?

352
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:53,240
You know who.

353
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:57,150
KNOW THYSELF

354
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,490
I did.

355
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:06,530
Then I think it's time for me to know a few more things.

356
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:08,970
So do I.

357
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:12,370
Tell me how I separated my mind from my body without jacking in.

358
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:16,560
Tell me how I stopped four sentinels by thinking it.

359
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:19,130
Tell me just what the hell is happening to me.

360
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:25,740
The power of the One extends beyond this world.

361
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:29,360
It reaches from here all the way back to where it came from.

362
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,430
Where?

363
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:34,990
The Source, that's what you felt when you touched those sentinels.

364
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:36,910
But you weren't ready for it.

365
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:38,860
You should be dead.

366
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:42,110
But apparently you weren't ready for that either.

367
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:47,130
The architect told me that if I didn't return to the Source...

368
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:49,530
...Zion would be destroyed by midnight tonight.

369
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:50,720
Please...

370
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:54,240
You and I may not be able to see beyond our own choices...

371
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,680
...but that man can't see past any choice.

372
00:27:57,290 --> 00:28:01,500
Why not? He doesn't understand them. He can't.

373
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,140
To him they're variables in an equation.

374
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:09,630
One at a time each variable must be solved and countered. That's his purpose.

375
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:12,300
To balance the equation.

376
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,530
What's your purpose?

377
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:16,890
To unbalance it.

378
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,090
Why?

379
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:19,940
What do you want?

380
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:22,590
I want the same thing you want Neo.

381
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:26,740
And I'm willing to go as far as you are to get it.

382
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:29,640
The end of the war.

383
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:32,040
Is it going to end?

384
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,580
One way or another.

385
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:37,820
Can Zion be saved?

386
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:43,670
I'm sorry I don't have the answer to that question, but...

387
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,030
If there's an answer...

388
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:49,320
...there's only one place you're going to find it.

389
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,610
Where?

390
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,700
You know where.

391
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:56,280
And if you can't find the answer...

392
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:01,240
...then I'm afraid there may be no tomorrow for any of us.

393
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:04,650
What does that mean?

394
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,870
Everything that has a beginning...

395
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,950
...has an end.

396
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:17,970
I see the end coming.

397
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,210
I see the darkness spreading.

398
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:23,760
I see death.

399
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:27,150
And you are all that stands in his way.

400
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:30,950
Smith. Very soon...

401
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:34,150
...he's going to have the power to destroy this world.

402
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:37,200
But I believe he won't stop there, he can't.

403
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:40,510
He won't stop until there's nothing left at all.

404
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:44,110
What is he? He is you.

405
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:46,820
Your opposite. Your negative.

406
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:50,750
The result of the equation trying to balance itself out.

407
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:52,570
And if I can't stop him?

408
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:55,030
One way or another, Neo...

409
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:58,700
...this war is going to end.

410
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:06,390
Tonight, the future of both worlds will be in your hands or in his.

411
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,700
How are you feeling?

412
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:25,300
Are you alright?

413
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:34,130
I need time.

414
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,470
That figures. Captain Roland.

415
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:45,130
What's up Maggie? Bane is. He's conscious.

416
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:48,690
Good. Maybe he's got some answers.

417
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:56,770
I love that smell.

418
00:30:57,610 --> 00:31:00,740
I sure am gonna miss it.

419
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,300
Oracle. I know, I know.

420
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,250
Sati, honey...

421
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:16,330
Take a few cookies and go with Seraph. Can I come back? I would like to come back.

422
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:20,020
I would like that too. Then I'll see you tomorrow.

423
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:25,390
I hope so honey, I hope so.

424
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:49,260
I'm scared Seraph.

425
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:51,230
Come.

426
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:37,570
He's following us.

427
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:45,400
Well, well, it's been a long time.

428
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:53,370
I remember chasing you was like chasing a ghost. I have beaten you before.

429
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:58,230
Yes, true, but as you can see, things are a little different now.

430
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:05,120
And you must be the last exile. The Oracle told me about you.

431
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,090
Really?

432
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:11,490
What did she say about me? That you're a bad man.

433
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:14,260
Oh, I'm not so bad...

434
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,450
...once you get to know me.

435
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:50,020
The great and powerful Oracle, we meet at last.

436
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:55,930
I suppose you've been expecting me. Right?

437
00:33:56,730 --> 00:34:02,480
The all-knowing Oracle is never surprised. How can she be? she knows everything.

438
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,420
But if that's true, then why is she here?

439
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:10,270
If she knew I was coming, why wouldn't she leave?

440
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:17,790
Maybe you knew I was going to do that, maybe you didn't.

441
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:20,440
If you did, that means you baked those cookies and...

442
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:23,020
...set that plate right there deliberately, purposefully.

443
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:27,940
Which means that you're sitting there also deliberately, purposefully.

444
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:30,840
What did you do with Sati?

445
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:36,490
Cookies need love, like everything does.

446
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:39,550
You are a bastard.

447
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:43,730
You would know Mom.

448
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:48,270
Do what you are here to do.

449
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:49,970
Yes ma'am.

450
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,120
I really wish I could help, I just...

451
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:40,340
I don't remember any of it.

452
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,570
What about the cuts on your arms?

453
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,190
Those cuts are more than one day old.

454
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,640
Yeah, definitely.

455
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:51,240
You're right about that, Sir.

456
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:55,280
They look like they might be self-inflicted.

457
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:59,360
But, why would I do something like that to myself?

458
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:03,810
Unless of course I wasn't myself.

459
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:09,720
But if I'm not me, then who am I?

460
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:18,980
Has this man been tested for VDTs? Yes sir, it was negative.

461
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:22,420
But he's showing a lot of unusual neural activity.

462
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:26,230
Some cross-synaptic firing, as well as signs of recent trauma...

463
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:29,850
...with fresh fibrotic scarring throughout the cortex.

464
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:35,590
I want the truth, I don't care what it takes. Make him remember.

465
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:59,090
Sir, we found her! The Logos?

466
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:02,450
Yes sir. 'Bout time we had some goddamn good news.

467
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:34,730
Are the thermals picking up any signs of life?

468
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,450
No sir. Nothing yet.

469
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:41,020
What about the ship? Holographic says the hull's intact.

470
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,080
Drop her down, and keep a man in the rear turret.

471
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:43,920
Yes, Sir.

472
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:59,010
Get a full diagnostic on that ship as fast as humanly possible.

473
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:20,130
Careful sir, the squids are sneaky bastards.

474
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:22,320
Could be a trap.

475
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,490
What was that?

476
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:55,830
You can put that shit away boys, all she needs is a jump.

477
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:57,400
Niobe.

478
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:58,760
Morpheus.

479
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:05,970
Are you alright? Yes, I'm fine.

480
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:09,730
We didn't know what happened after...

481
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,030
I'm sorry.

482
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,370
It's ok...

483
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:16,410
I'm happy to see you too.

484
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:19,060
Did you get Neo out? Yes.

485
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,260
How did you know about that? The Oracle.

486
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:24,770
You saw her? Just before the Sentinels found us.

487
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:25,780
What did she tell you?

488
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:29,070
The same things she always does.

489
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:33,370
Exactly what I needed to hear.

490
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:37,310
In less than 12 hours the machines will breach the dock walls.

491
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:41,950
Every simulation we've run, we've seen that once the machines are inside the city...

492
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:44,860
...the odds of our survival decrease dramatically.

493
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:47,470
Thus our primary objective must be to destroy...

494
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:50,800
...or disable the diggers inside the dock.

495
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:54,640
If we can do that, perhaps we can prevent them from ever reaching the city.

496
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:57,060
If not, the only place we would be able to mount an...

497
00:39:57,060 --> 00:40:00,680
...effective defense would be at the entrance of the Temple.

498
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:03,430
It's small enough that it would force them into a bottleneck...

499
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:06,940
...allowing us to concentrate the remainder of our defense.

500
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:10,050
We understand that you've requested additional volunteers.

501
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:11,220
That is correct.

502
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:13,610
Precisely what size of force are you planning...

503
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:16,510
...to commit to the primary dock objective?

504
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:19,950
Right now, the entire APU Corps and half the infantry.

505
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:23,240
Half the infantry? If it were up to me Councillor...

506
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:25,930
I'd take every man, woman and child, put a gun in...

507
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:28,430
...their hand and march them straight into that dock.

508
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:31,430
Perhaps it is best that it is not up to you.

509
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:34,000
Time will tell, Councillor.

510
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,650
Commander, just one more question.

511
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:39,610
Has there been word from the Nebuchadnezzar? None.

512
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:42,760
And at this point there's no reason to expect there ever will be.

513
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,150
Perhaps.

514
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:46,370
But we can hope.

515
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:51,420
I'm afraid hope is an indulgence I don't have time for.

516
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,050
Zee, what are you doing?

517
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,800
Making shells.

518
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,540
They're evacuating our level, we have to go.

519
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:10,490
I'm not going with you. What?

520
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:14,130
They've called for volunteers to hold the dock.

521
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,390
Kids, you stay here.

522
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:24,660
I know how you feel, Zee, but you can't do this.

523
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:25,780
I have to. Why?

524
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:28,610
Because I love him.

525
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:31,630
I love him the same as he loves me.

526
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:35,290
And if I were out there and he were here I know what he'd do.

527
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:38,370
But you're gonna get yourself killed.

528
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:40,630
It's crazy Zee.

529
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:43,000
Maybe it is.

530
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:45,340
But ask yourself, if it were Dozer, you knew the only...

531
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:49,030
...chance you had to see him again was to hold the dock.

532
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,910
What would you do?

533
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:58,220
Make shells.

534
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,800
What the shit is going on over here?

535
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,840
An accident, sir.

536
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:17,160
I didn't see, sorry.

537
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,800
Who the hell are you? A unit volunteer sir.

538
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:25,750
What's a pod-born pencil-neck like you doing volunteering for my corps?

539
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,680
I wanna do my part, sir!

540
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:30,290
We gotta hold the dock.

541
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:31,630
How old are you, kid?

542
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:35,540
Eighteen. Should have said sixteen, I might have believed that!

543
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:39,280
Ok, I'm sixteen. Minimum age for the corps is 18.

544
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:40,950
Sixteen's too young.

545
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:46,480
Machines don't care how old I am. They'll kill me just the same.

546
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:49,080
Ain't that the goddamned truth.

547
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:51,090
Give me a chance, Sir.

548
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:53,070
I won't let you down.

549
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:59,350
You do, and you'll find me and the machines have got something in common.

550
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:13,600
Ok, charge the igniter.

551
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:22,130
She lives again.

552
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,740
You want us to patch an uplink to reload the operations software, Sparky?

553
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:30,070
Yeah, that'd be swell. Could you clean the windshield while you're at it?

554
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:36,850
Uplinks are in place, I'm bringing her back online.

555
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:40,160
Looking good, except uh...

556
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:43,800
Something's wrong with the Matrix feed.

557
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:44,810
No there's not.

558
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,870
You're looking at what we're looking at.

559
00:43:46,930 --> 00:43:48,350
What the hell is going on in there?

560
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:51,160
Whatever it is, it can't be good.

561
00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:54,300
The machines have taken Junction 21.

562
00:43:54,370 --> 00:43:57,640
The way I see it, if we drop down from broadcast here...

563
00:43:57,710 --> 00:44:00,200
...at Interstate 153, we might surprise them.

564
00:44:00,850 --> 00:44:05,220
We'll go first, hammer as deep as we can, then blow our EMP.

565
00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:09,090
Hopefully we can punch a hole big enough for you to get through.

566
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:14,930
It ain't pretty, but the way I see it, it's the only way back.

567
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:16,860
No it's not.

568
00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:18,900
There's another way.

569
00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:20,450
A support line.

570
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:22,190
It drops down right here.

571
00:44:22,210 --> 00:44:24,330
A thousand meters short of 21.

572
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:28,580
If we're lucky we may be able to slip down without them ever knowing.

573
00:44:28,890 --> 00:44:32,480
That's a mechanical line. It's impossible, no one can pilot a mechanical.

574
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:33,340
I can.

575
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:34,190
Bullshit.

576
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:37,620
I've done it. That was a long time ago, Niobe.

577
00:44:37,690 --> 00:44:39,170
I said I can do it.

578
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:41,840
So what? If you can you'll be the only one that can.

579
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,650
There's no way we can follow you.

580
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:47,600
Hi.

581
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:53,870
I know time is always against us. I'm sorry that I took so long.

582
00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:57,560
But I wanted to be sure. Sure of what?

583
00:44:58,060 --> 00:45:00,530
I know what I have to do. What?

584
00:45:00,590 --> 00:45:03,720
There's no easy way to say this, so I'll just say it.

585
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:05,680
I have to take one of the ships.

586
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:08,020
What? To go where?

587
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:11,700
To the machine city.

588
00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:17,640
I know it's difficult to understand.

589
00:45:17,710 --> 00:45:20,650
No, It's not, you're out of your goddamn mind.

590
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:23,640
I still have to go. You'll never make it. In 100 years...

591
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,850
...no ship has been within a hundred kilometers of it.

592
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:28,170
You'll never make it. I have to try.

593
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:30,390
Is this what the Oracle has told you?

594
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:31,770
No.

595
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,400
This is asinine. If you wanna kill yourself, go do it.

596
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,500
But do it without wasting one of our ships.

597
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:39,730
You have to believe me, I have to go.

598
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:40,270
Bullshit!

599
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:43,650
I am the captain of this ship, I say where it has to go!

600
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:48,500
And believe me, this ship will go to hell long before I let you take it anywhere.

601
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:53,160
He can take mine.

602
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:55,060
You can't do that.

603
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:59,280
Don't even think of trying to tell me what I can...

604
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,880
...or cannot do with my ship after that little speech.

605
00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:06,890
But for Christ sake, Niobe. I'll pilot this ship, he can take mine.

606
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:10,750
If we leave inside the hour we should reach Zion as the machines do.

607
00:46:10,830 --> 00:46:12,990
That's as good a plan as any.

608
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:16,530
It's a waste. A Goddamn waste.

609
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:25,040
Two ships, two directions.

610
00:46:25,310 --> 00:46:29,190
Sounds like providence, doesn't it Morpheus?

611
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:32,230
You've never believed in The One.

612
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:35,830
I still don't. Then why are you doing this?

613
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:38,510
I believe in him.

614
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:40,640
Thank you.

615
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:50,020
What's that for? To help you relax.

616
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,910
Make it easier for you to remember.

617
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:56,520
What if i don't want to remember?

618
00:46:56,630 --> 00:46:58,850
Why would you want that?

619
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:01,670
What if I blew that EMP?

620
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,300
What if I did destroy those ships and I am responsible...

621
00:47:06,310 --> 00:47:09,810
...for the deaths of all those men?

622
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:18,710
If I did that, it wouldn't be very safe for me here.

623
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:19,760
Would it?

624
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:33,250
Of course it might not be very safe for you, either.

625
00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:42,900
I'm ready.

626
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:45,250
Trinity.

627
00:47:47,050 --> 00:47:49,650
There's something I have to say.

628
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:55,430
There's something you need to understand.

629
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,600
I know I'm supposed to go.

630
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:04,860
But beyond that... I don't know I...

631
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:10,360
I know. You don't think you're coming back.

632
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:14,160
I knew it the moment you said you had to leave.

633
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:16,560
I could see it in your face.

634
00:48:16,590 --> 00:48:18,890
Just like you knew the moment you looked at me...

635
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:22,180
...that I was coming with you.

636
00:48:23,770 --> 00:48:27,550
I'm scared Trin. So am I.

637
00:48:28,590 --> 00:48:32,570
It took me ten minutes to buckle up one boot.

638
00:48:33,170 --> 00:48:36,700
But I'll tell you something. Six hours ago...

639
00:48:36,850 --> 00:48:38,850
...I told the Merovingian I was ready...

640
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:42,440
...to give anything and everything for you.

641
00:48:44,430 --> 00:48:47,020
You know what's changed in the last 6 hours?

642
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:47,990
No.

643
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:51,940
Nothing.

644
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:06,230
Have you finished loading that amunition? Just about, sir.

645
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:08,790
Lets move it, we're out of time.

646
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:11,090
You're not leaving them anything?

647
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:13,290
He said he didn't need it.

648
00:49:16,610 --> 00:49:21,280
I ain't saying goodbye, I'm saying good luck.

649
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:22,410
Thank you.

650
00:49:27,870 --> 00:49:30,390
I can only hope you know what you're doing.

651
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:32,530
Me too.

652
00:49:36,430 --> 00:49:39,710
It was an honour, Sir.

653
00:49:41,450 --> 00:49:45,970
No, the honour's still mine.

654
00:49:58,250 --> 00:49:59,360
We're ready sir.

655
00:49:59,490 --> 00:50:01,450
'Bout damn time.

656
00:50:02,490 --> 00:50:06,000
We're already late Captain, so lets hit it and hit it hard.

657
00:50:09,610 --> 00:50:14,040
Bye baby, take good care of them.

658
00:50:35,310 --> 00:50:37,140
Ready?

659
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:46,890
Engine's still firing.

660
00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:50,780
Must be a fuse, I'll check it out.

661
00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:07,010
I should've known he'd send his bitch first.

662
00:51:07,010 --> 00:51:07,510
Bane!

663
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:11,070
No one ever got away from me as many times as you did.

664
00:51:11,170 --> 00:51:13,220
Every single time I thought it was the last.

665
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:16,860
Everytime I was sure we had you, but somehow you'd slip through our fingers.

666
00:51:17,010 --> 00:51:22,030
I really can't express just how aggravating that can be.

667
00:51:22,670 --> 00:51:24,410
What are you talking about?

668
00:51:25,390 --> 00:51:30,110
I think I might enjoy killing you as much as killing him.

669
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:49,390
Neo, it's Bane, he's psychotic!

670
00:51:49,870 --> 00:51:53,080
You're gonna pay for that.

671
00:51:54,190 --> 00:51:55,980
27 kilometers to go.

672
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:58,530
Captain, we got an emergency down here. What is it AK?

673
00:51:58,550 --> 00:51:59,780
It's Maggie, sir.

674
00:51:59,830 --> 00:52:00,960
She's dead.

675
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:04,070
Murdered. I think it was Bane. Goddamn it.

676
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:10,250
I knew it. I knew he was out of his goddamn mind.

677
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:15,380
He fired that EMP. God damn it, I should have beaten it out of him.

678
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:18,080
We've searched the whole ship Captain.

679
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:20,290
He ain't here.

680
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:23,860
I know where he is. The Logos.

681
00:52:24,510 --> 00:52:26,930
We gotta go back. Too late.

682
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:28,700
You don't know that, what if they need our help?

683
00:52:28,790 --> 00:52:30,740
It's too dangerous. Why?

684
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:34,330
Because if he's killed them, he will control another EMP.

685
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:37,500
At this point they're on their own.

686
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:39,010
Just like us.

687
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:41,880
Mr. Anderson...

688
00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:47,060
I see you're as predictable in this world as you are in the other.

689
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:49,360
What? He's out of his mind.

690
00:52:49,370 --> 00:52:50,970
It might appear that way to you, but Mr. Anderson...

691
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:55,170
...and I know that appearances can be deceiving.

692
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:57,970
Confused, Mr. Anderson?

693
00:52:58,050 --> 00:52:59,690
It'll all become clear in a moment.

694
00:52:59,790 --> 00:53:02,620
Now, thank you for bringing me the gun. You can set it down right there.

695
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:03,960
Don't do it.

696
00:53:04,330 --> 00:53:07,030
Shoot, shoot now.

697
00:53:07,030 --> 00:53:09,790
Yes, shoot. Fry us. Burn us alive!

698
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,880
Do it! If you don't he'll kill us both.

699
00:53:13,770 --> 00:53:17,840
Look at him. He knows he should do it, but he won't.

700
00:53:17,870 --> 00:53:20,620
He can't. Do it.

701
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:30,810
Back away from the gun and turn around.

702
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:40,450
Let her go.

703
00:53:53,850 --> 00:53:56,450
Somehow familiar, isn't it?

704
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:00,950
We've been here before, you and I, remember?

705
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,370
I do

706
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:05,950
I think of nothing else

707
00:54:09,250 --> 00:54:13,090
Who are you? Still don't recognize me?

708
00:54:13,310 --> 00:54:18,120
I admit, it's difficult to even think, encased in this rotting piece of meat.

709
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:24,270
The stink of it filling every breath, a suffocating cloud you can't escape.

710
00:54:26,610 --> 00:54:27,770
Disgusting.

711
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:31,380
Look at how pathetically fragile it is.

712
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:34,860
Nothing this weak is meant to survive.

713
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:41,290
What do you want?

714
00:54:41,310 --> 00:54:44,110
I want what you want.

715
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:47,770
Yes...

716
00:54:48,030 --> 00:54:50,700
That's it Mr. Anderson.

717
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:54,780
Look past the flesh, look through the soft gelatin...

718
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:59,390
...of these dull cow eyes, and see your enemy.

719
00:55:00,010 --> 00:55:01,120
No.

720
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:03,700
Oh, yes, Mr. Anderson.

721
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:05,050
It can't be.

722
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:09,130
There's nowhere I can't go, there's nowhere I won't find you.

723
00:55:09,150 --> 00:55:11,430
It's impossible.

724
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,770
Not impossible.

725
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:16,380
Inevitable.

726
00:55:17,770 --> 00:55:19,830
Goodbye Mr. Anderson.

727
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:22,170
This is it, it's gotta be.

728
00:56:07,210 --> 00:56:09,100
Oh no!

729
00:56:26,490 --> 00:56:30,910
I wish you could see yourself Mr. Anderson.

730
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:37,760
The blind messiah.

731
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:45,230
You're a symbol for all of your kind, Mr. Anderson.

732
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:49,750
Helpless.

733
00:56:52,090 --> 00:56:54,660
Pathetic.

734
00:56:57,110 --> 00:57:01,440
Just waiting to be put out of your misery.

735
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,150
I can see you.

736
00:57:17,190 --> 00:57:22,740
It's not over Mr. Anderson, it's not over.

737
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:38,320
Trinity! Neo.

738
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:46,350
Oh, no.

739
00:57:46,590 --> 00:57:48,100
Your eyes.

740
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:50,180
I'll be ok.

741
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:53,580
It's alright Trin.

742
00:57:55,450 --> 00:57:58,860
But I think you're gonna have to drive.

743
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:08,430
Seismic's projecting 22 minutes to breach.

744
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:11,960
They can't know we don't have an EMP. They'll have to attack in waves.

745
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:15,130
Concentrate our offense on the diggers.

746
00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:17,530
Order the APUs into position.

747
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:18,390
Yes, sir.

748
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:50,890
Come on, move.

749
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:24,470
All right.

750
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:27,090
This is it.

751
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:28,850
Now, you all know me,

752
00:59:28,850 --> 00:59:32,650
so I'll just say this as simple as I can.

753
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:37,050
If it's our time to die, it's our time.

754
00:59:37,090 --> 00:59:42,840
All I ask is: if we have to give these bastards our lives...

755
00:59:42,910 --> 00:59:46,690
...we give them hell before we do!

756
01:00:02,850 --> 01:00:04,410
You scared, Charra?

757
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:06,090
Shit, yeah.

758
01:00:06,870 --> 01:00:08,860
But I'll make you a deal.

759
01:00:08,990 --> 01:00:11,710
You keep loadin', I keep shootin'.

760
01:00:13,310 --> 01:00:16,010
Deal.

761
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:28,150
Holy Christ, would you look at that? Quiet.

762
01:00:28,190 --> 01:00:32,090
How far is the opening? 1.4 kilometers

763
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:34,700
We're still generating too hot a field.

764
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:36,830
Ghost, kill all auxilliary systems.

765
01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:39,610
Give me full manual, drop down four pads.

766
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:41,960
It'll bottom out!

767
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:52,770
Easy baby.

768
01:00:52,770 --> 01:00:54,640
700 meters.

769
01:00:56,660 --> 01:01:00,090
If we can just get close enough.

770
01:01:03,690 --> 01:01:05,400
600 meters.

771
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:07,210
There.

772
01:01:15,610 --> 01:01:16,740
Shit.

773
01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:21,860
Jig's up, here they come. Give me full power, full systems!

774
01:01:21,890 --> 01:01:23,590
Man the gun turrets! every goddamn one of them.

775
01:01:23,630 --> 01:01:26,870
Go, go! Ghost, you're the best gunner we have, go with them.

776
01:01:26,910 --> 01:01:29,130
Morpheus take his place.

777
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:47,570
I'm coming baby.

778
01:01:56,900 --> 01:01:58,420
Here they come.

779
01:02:03,540 --> 01:02:08,680
Slow down, this ain't the Logos! Hold on to your lunch, Roland, here we go.

780
01:02:16,530 --> 01:02:19,770
Holy Christ, I didn't know this ship could do that.

781
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:14,030
Breach! The dock is breached!

782
01:03:33,730 --> 01:03:35,790
Knuckle up!

783
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:51,320
For Zion!

784
01:05:58,600 --> 01:05:59,810
Shit.

785
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:07,190
Come on, let's go!

786
01:06:12,110 --> 01:06:14,460
Knuckle up!

787
01:06:29,610 --> 01:06:31,400
Reload!

788
01:06:32,770 --> 01:06:35,220
Reload nine!

789
01:06:41,250 --> 01:06:43,030
Go, go! Move, move!

790
01:06:54,380 --> 01:06:56,490
Watch your left!

791
01:06:57,630 --> 01:07:00,330
Don't let them through!

792
01:07:02,550 --> 01:07:04,610
Zuka!

793
01:07:41,350 --> 01:07:43,650
Oh my God.

794
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:58,420
Where the hell is my infantry?

795
01:07:58,460 --> 01:08:01,000
I want that goddamn machine taken down!

796
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:36,090
Dig this.

797
01:08:39,870 --> 01:08:41,990
Oh, shit!

798
01:09:01,210 --> 01:09:04,590
Bogey two at the breach point! Goddamnit.

799
01:09:30,230 --> 01:09:33,030
Shit, she's got a fat ass!

800
01:09:41,730 --> 01:09:45,450
Keep 'em off me. Goddamn, there's a shitstorm of 'em.

801
01:10:16,730 --> 01:10:20,860
Captain, do you see that? They're after the radio, stop 'em.

802
01:10:27,510 --> 01:10:28,640
Damn it.

803
01:10:53,450 --> 01:10:54,510
Yeah.

804
01:11:06,730 --> 01:11:08,440
Grab my belt.

805
01:11:19,190 --> 01:11:22,030
Just give me one clean shot.

806
01:11:27,660 --> 01:11:28,590
Damn it!

807
01:11:51,460 --> 01:11:53,090
Charra!

808
01:11:58,230 --> 01:11:59,400
Commander Lock, I've got incoming!

809
01:11:59,630 --> 01:12:02,450
I've got a dock full of incoming! Sir, yes Sir, but this is different, Sir.

810
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:05,340
What? I think it's one of ours.

811
01:12:06,250 --> 01:12:08,550
That's impossible. Holographics are trying to confirm, Sir.

812
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:13,120
Contact them, I want access codes. We're trying Sir, there's no response.

813
01:12:14,850 --> 01:12:17,860
It's a trick. That's not one of ours, it can't be.

814
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:21,680
That's a mechanical line, no one can pilot mechanical.

815
01:12:32,330 --> 01:12:33,730
Foreward aft, 30 degrees at 80 percent.

816
01:12:33,820 --> 01:12:36,060
30 degrees, 80.

817
01:12:38,060 --> 01:12:41,360
Lower starboard, 60 degrees, 20 percent. 60 degrees.

818
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:44,480
Shit!

819
01:12:44,780 --> 01:12:46,350
Come on, keep up! I'm trying!

820
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:08,320
Sir, holographic confirms.

821
01:13:08,390 --> 01:13:09,560
It's the Hammer Sir.

822
01:13:09,610 --> 01:13:10,980
How can that be?

823
01:13:11,260 --> 01:13:13,420
The ship is under attack, sustaining heavy damage.

824
01:13:13,580 --> 01:13:16,620
But at its present velocity it'll reach Gate 3 in 12 minutes.

825
01:13:16,630 --> 01:13:19,890
Sir, their EMP could take out every sentinel up there.

826
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:21,080
It'd take out more than that.

827
01:13:21,390 --> 01:13:23,360
It'll wipe out our entire defense system.

828
01:13:23,460 --> 01:13:26,000
We blow an EMP inside, we will lose the dock.

829
01:13:26,170 --> 01:13:28,760
Sir, we've already lost the dock.

830
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:34,090
Open the gate.

831
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:36,810
Gate 3 is not responding!

832
01:13:37,460 --> 01:13:39,360
It's taken critical damage, Sir!

833
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:40,990
We've lost control!

834
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:42,290
We can't open it!

835
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:55,010
There's the exit. On my mark, give me full power.

836
01:13:55,050 --> 01:13:56,880
90 degrees to lower-left starboard.

837
01:13:57,350 --> 01:13:58,390
Full power.

838
01:13:59,110 --> 01:14:00,980
90 degrees.

839
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:07,450
Now!

840
01:14:15,820 --> 01:14:17,950
Hold on, baby!

841
01:14:22,550 --> 01:14:24,610
Goddamn woman, you can drive!

842
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:27,380
We ain't home yet. What about the Gate?

843
01:14:28,830 --> 01:14:31,550
The sentinels are inside the dock.

844
01:14:32,050 --> 01:14:34,140
Are we too late?

845
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:05,750
How many APUs are operational? Thirteen, Sir.

846
01:15:05,850 --> 01:15:08,560
Get me the one closest to Gate 3.

847
01:15:36,060 --> 01:15:37,600
Reload!

848
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,200
He's pissin' metal.

849
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:43,050
Go!

850
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:23,320
Heads up, they're coming around!!

851
01:16:35,940 --> 01:16:37,880
Behind you!

852
01:16:51,660 --> 01:16:54,220
It's jammed!

853
01:16:59,070 --> 01:17:01,800
Forget it, Kid! Get outta here!

854
01:17:02,890 --> 01:17:04,930
Got it!

855
01:17:33,070 --> 01:17:34,880
Captain Mifune!

856
01:17:38,190 --> 01:17:39,090
No.

857
01:17:40,690 --> 01:17:41,800
They're coming.

858
01:17:43,750 --> 01:17:48,200
They're coming. The Hammer.

859
01:17:48,910 --> 01:17:49,660
What?

860
01:17:50,690 --> 01:17:53,660
You have to open that gate.

861
01:17:54,250 --> 01:17:56,960
Cut the counterweights.

862
01:17:58,350 --> 01:18:00,410
You can do it.

863
01:18:00,810 --> 01:18:03,460
Hurry, there's no time.

864
01:18:04,220 --> 01:18:08,660
Captain. I didn't finish the training program.

865
01:18:11,790 --> 01:18:13,990
Neither did I.

866
01:18:35,570 --> 01:18:36,750
Lock that down.

867
01:18:36,950 --> 01:18:38,320
Kill the feeder.

868
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:41,110
We won't make it. we gotta blow the EMP now.

869
01:18:41,610 --> 01:18:45,210
Come on, someone, please!

870
01:18:58,890 --> 01:19:00,750
Keep the weight forward.

871
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:05,470
Light as a feather, light as a feather.

872
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:14,640
Commander, holographics reports Captain Mifune's APU is up and moving to Gate 3.

873
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:21,780
Don't oversqueeze the trigger.

874
01:19:32,110 --> 01:19:34,620
Captain Mifune's APU just reached Gate 3.

875
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:37,320
How much time? Two minutes to impact.

876
01:19:38,150 --> 01:19:39,480
Captain Mifune, do you copy?

877
01:19:39,480 --> 01:19:41,200
His radio is down, Sir.

878
01:19:42,010 --> 01:19:42,940
Mifune...

879
01:19:43,630 --> 01:19:44,670
This is Lock.

880
01:19:45,670 --> 01:19:48,180
I don't know if you can hear me, but if you can...

881
01:19:48,610 --> 01:19:50,870
...the Hammer is two minutes away.

882
01:19:51,030 --> 01:19:52,820
You got two minutes, Captain...

883
01:19:52,860 --> 01:19:55,900
...to get that Gate open.

884
01:19:57,080 --> 01:19:58,280
Link!

885
01:19:59,390 --> 01:20:01,780
Get to the main deck! Charge the EMP!

886
01:20:37,910 --> 01:20:39,580
Do it, Kid.

887
01:20:43,570 --> 01:20:46,810
Neo, I believe.

888
01:20:55,690 --> 01:20:56,800
Yes.

889
01:20:57,130 --> 01:20:58,840
Can we make it?

890
01:20:59,090 --> 01:21:01,530
We ain't come this far.

891
01:21:12,520 --> 01:21:14,000
Almost home.

892
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:15,490
Almost home.

893
01:21:34,900 --> 01:21:37,270
Burn it Link!

894
01:22:00,770 --> 01:22:02,040
You did it.

895
01:22:02,410 --> 01:22:05,410
No, we did it.

896
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:08,900
You're a hell of a pilot.

897
01:22:10,270 --> 01:22:14,260
Some things in this world never change.

898
01:22:14,370 --> 01:22:16,600
But some things do?

899
01:22:17,470 --> 01:22:21,660
Luckily, some things do.

900
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,490
Link!

901
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:35,140
Zee?

902
01:22:35,300 --> 01:22:36,790
Link? Zee!

903
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:46,830
I knew you'd come. I knew it.

904
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,650
I made a promise.

905
01:22:57,770 --> 01:22:59,350
You did wear it.

906
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:04,110
Are you kidding? I'm never gonna take it off.

907
01:23:14,100 --> 01:23:15,840
Three captains, one ship

908
01:23:16,270 --> 01:23:19,840
I'll assume the other ships were lost under equally pointless circumstances

909
01:23:19,850 --> 01:23:21,950
It's good to see you too, Jason

910
01:23:22,390 --> 01:23:24,450
The council is waiting to hear your explanation

911
01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:28,680
You would forgive me for not attending but I have to try to salvage this debacle

912
01:23:29,450 --> 01:23:32,150
Did I miss something, commander? I thought we'd just saved the dock.

913
01:23:32,250 --> 01:23:34,030
That's the problem with you people.

914
01:23:34,370 --> 01:23:36,390
You can't think for five minutes in front of your face.

915
01:23:37,020 --> 01:23:40,310
The EMP knocked out almost every piece of hardware and every APU.

916
01:23:40,310 --> 01:23:43,600
If I were the machines, I would send every sentinel I had here right now

917
01:23:43,620 --> 01:23:48,410
Saved the dock, Captain? You've just handed it to them on a silver platter

918
01:23:53,420 --> 01:23:55,240
Come on, get it cut!

919
01:23:57,270 --> 01:23:58,730
The bridge is clear

920
01:24:01,130 --> 01:24:02,600
Do you hear that?

921
01:24:05,180 --> 01:24:06,580
Get that cable run

922
01:24:06,950 --> 01:24:08,420
I want the system back online.

923
01:24:08,420 --> 01:24:11,960
Commander, it's the dock. We've got incoming.

924
01:24:12,180 --> 01:24:14,050
Order everyone to fall back.

925
01:24:14,810 --> 01:24:17,960
Seal all the shaft. Now!

926
01:24:18,270 --> 01:24:18,790
Move it!

927
01:24:23,310 --> 01:24:25,750
Oh my God!

928
01:24:32,900 --> 01:24:34,000
All clear

929
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:35,000
Do it!

930
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:35,900
Go! Go!

931
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:55,520
Your move!

932
01:24:55,780 --> 01:24:58,640
So you gave them your ship.

933
01:24:58,850 --> 01:25:00,590
That is correct, Councillor, I did.

934
01:25:01,240 --> 01:25:03,990
Knowing what he planned to do with it?

935
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:07,350
And the Oracle said nothing of this?

936
01:25:07,490 --> 01:25:10,340
She told me that Neo would need my help and when the time came...

937
01:25:10,340 --> 01:25:12,330
...I would choose to help him or not.

938
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:16,850
But what hope can a single vessel have against their entire defense system?

939
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:18,760
None, it's completely impossible.

940
01:25:18,850 --> 01:25:20,440
But he wouldn't listen.

941
01:25:20,490 --> 01:25:24,240
He wouldn't even take any ammunition. He was totally out of his goddamn mind.

942
01:25:24,620 --> 01:25:27,490
No, he wasn't.

943
01:25:29,540 --> 01:25:31,730
Neo is doing what he believes he must do.

944
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:35,550
I don't know if what he's doing is right.

945
01:25:35,590 --> 01:25:39,630
I don't know if he'll reach the machine city.

946
01:25:39,820 --> 01:25:42,920
And if he does, I don't know what he can do to save us.

947
01:25:43,770 --> 01:25:49,030
But I do know that as long as there's single breath in his body...

948
01:25:50,660 --> 01:25:52,830
...he will not give up.

949
01:25:53,730 --> 01:25:56,290
And neither can we.

950
01:26:02,090 --> 01:26:04,290
Temperature's dropping.

951
01:26:06,690 --> 01:26:08,720
Here we go.

952
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:50,760
We're over the fields, aren't we?

953
01:26:50,770 --> 01:26:52,460
How do you know that?

954
01:26:52,660 --> 01:26:54,360
I can feel them.

955
01:27:03,310 --> 01:27:04,740
Over there.

956
01:27:05,810 --> 01:27:08,930
There is our path, can you see it?

957
01:27:08,950 --> 01:27:11,630
Three lines. Power lines.

958
01:27:11,910 --> 01:27:13,780
Follow them.

959
01:27:30,760 --> 01:27:32,110
What are they doing?

960
01:27:33,180 --> 01:27:34,110
I don't know.

961
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:36,680
Lieutenant!

962
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:53,920
Goddamn it!

963
01:27:54,650 --> 01:27:56,930
What do we do now, Commander?

964
01:28:00,440 --> 01:28:01,710
It's now a matter of time.

965
01:28:03,480 --> 01:28:06,780
Machines will breach the walls of the city.

966
01:28:07,270 --> 01:28:11,690
I recommend that the Council join the rest of the non-military personnel inside the Temple.

967
01:28:11,750 --> 01:28:14,160
How long do we have?

968
01:28:14,230 --> 01:28:16,810
Two hours, maybe less.

969
01:28:18,570 --> 01:28:23,750
My men have begun fortifying the entrance with enough artillery to make our last stand.

970
01:28:24,860 --> 01:28:27,580
Beyond that there isn't anything more I can do.

971
01:28:27,770 --> 01:28:31,530
Commander, do you think that we have any chance of surviving?

972
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:36,300
If I were you, Councillor, I wouldn't ask me that question.

973
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:37,560
I would ask him.

974
01:28:38,290 --> 01:28:39,220
Why?

975
01:28:39,990 --> 01:28:44,120
Because he's the one who believes in miracles.

976
01:28:49,820 --> 01:28:52,010
There, those mountains.

977
01:28:52,970 --> 01:28:54,160
That's it.

978
01:28:58,360 --> 01:29:00,270
Do you see what's out there? Yes.

979
01:29:01,030 --> 01:29:03,520
If you tell me we'll make it I'll believe you.

980
01:29:03,560 --> 01:29:05,320
We'll make it.

981
01:29:07,710 --> 01:29:09,620
We have to.

982
01:30:22,630 --> 01:30:24,680
Sentinels!

983
01:30:35,710 --> 01:30:37,780
There's too many.

984
01:30:53,390 --> 01:30:55,580
Gotcha!

985
01:30:56,340 --> 01:30:58,010
Come on, Neo, I need help here!

986
01:30:58,010 --> 01:30:59,480
I can't beat them.

987
01:30:59,560 --> 01:31:00,900
What'll we do? Go up!

988
01:31:00,920 --> 01:31:02,070
Over them. What?

989
01:31:02,140 --> 01:31:03,340
The sky.

990
01:31:03,340 --> 01:31:04,920
It's the only way.

991
01:31:06,050 --> 01:31:08,120
Then up we go.

992
01:31:42,970 --> 01:31:44,460
Beautiful.

993
01:32:06,980 --> 01:32:09,800
Pump the igniter, the ship will start.

994
01:32:16,870 --> 01:32:18,100
Again!

995
01:32:18,210 --> 01:32:19,310
Slowly.

996
01:32:22,280 --> 01:32:23,650
Now!

997
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:50,310
Trin?

998
01:32:53,220 --> 01:32:54,060
Trinity?

999
01:32:55,970 --> 01:32:56,740
Trinity?!

1000
01:32:58,610 --> 01:33:01,040
I'm here. Where?

1001
01:33:01,250 --> 01:33:02,090
Here.

1002
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:14,190
We made it.

1003
01:33:15,900 --> 01:33:17,760
You said we would.

1004
01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:21,840
It's unbelievable Trin.

1005
01:33:23,470 --> 01:33:25,230
Light everywhere.

1006
01:33:25,480 --> 01:33:27,830
Like the whole thing was built of light.

1007
01:33:28,640 --> 01:33:30,900
I wish you could see what I see.

1008
01:33:32,370 --> 01:33:35,230
You've already shown me so much.

1009
01:33:37,150 --> 01:33:40,560
What is it Trinity? What's wrong?

1010
01:33:41,750 --> 01:33:44,470
I can't go with you Neo.

1011
01:33:45,880 --> 01:33:48,150
I've gone as far as I can.

1012
01:33:48,280 --> 01:33:49,050
What?

1013
01:33:52,090 --> 01:33:53,580
Oh, no.

1014
01:33:54,690 --> 01:33:56,530
Oh, no, no, no!

1015
01:33:57,140 --> 01:33:58,140
It's all right.

1016
01:34:00,280 --> 01:34:01,900
It's time.

1017
01:34:03,370 --> 01:34:05,640
I've done all that I could do.

1018
01:34:07,120 --> 01:34:09,820
Now you have to do the rest.

1019
01:34:10,310 --> 01:34:12,150
You have to finish it.

1020
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:15,170
You have to save Zion.

1021
01:34:15,350 --> 01:34:16,860
I can't.

1022
01:34:17,490 --> 01:34:18,920
Not without you.

1023
01:34:18,950 --> 01:34:20,730
Yes you can.

1024
01:34:21,290 --> 01:34:23,380
You will.

1025
01:34:23,890 --> 01:34:27,680
I believe. I always have.

1026
01:34:29,770 --> 01:34:30,730
Trinity.

1027
01:34:33,250 --> 01:34:37,100
Trinity. You can't die.

1028
01:34:39,160 --> 01:34:41,110
You can't.

1029
01:34:41,490 --> 01:34:42,290
You can't.

1030
01:34:43,060 --> 01:34:45,470
Yes, I can.

1031
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:50,940
You brought me back once.

1032
01:34:53,210 --> 01:34:55,910
But not this time.

1033
01:35:01,180 --> 01:35:03,180
Do you remember...

1034
01:35:03,350 --> 01:35:06,790
...on that roof, after you caught me...

1035
01:35:08,250 --> 01:35:12,410
...the last thing I said to you?

1036
01:35:14,010 --> 01:35:16,340
You said: "I'm sorry".

1037
01:35:16,770 --> 01:35:19,130
I wish I hadn't.

1038
01:35:21,910 --> 01:35:25,490
That was my last thought.

1039
01:35:26,650 --> 01:35:29,680
I wished I had one more chance...

1040
01:35:30,280 --> 01:35:33,350
...to say what really mattered.

1041
01:35:35,210 --> 01:35:38,120
To say how much I loved you.

1042
01:35:40,300 --> 01:35:44,580
How grateful I was for every moment I was with you.

1043
01:35:45,980 --> 01:35:49,680
But by the time I knew how to say what I wanted to...

1044
01:35:49,730 --> 01:35:51,760
...it was too late.

1045
01:35:56,630 --> 01:35:59,830
But you brought me back.

1046
01:36:03,080 --> 01:36:05,680
You gave me my wish.

1047
01:36:08,570 --> 01:36:13,250
One more chance to say what I really wanted to say.

1048
01:36:17,250 --> 01:36:18,640
Kiss me.

1049
01:36:22,160 --> 01:36:24,560
Once more.

1050
01:36:25,620 --> 01:36:27,090
Kiss me.

1051
01:36:54,120 --> 01:36:58,280
Get that ammunition where it belongs! You got one chance to get this right.

1052
01:36:58,810 --> 01:37:01,000
Get that damn thing mounted.

1053
01:37:05,800 --> 01:37:08,490
Hurry. Let's go, let's go!

1054
01:37:22,990 --> 01:37:24,030
Neo...

1055
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,870
If you're gonna do something, you better do it quick.

1056
01:39:36,240 --> 01:39:38,590
I only ask to say what I've come to say.

1057
01:39:38,590 --> 01:39:42,130
After that, do what you want, and I won't try to stop you.

1058
01:39:46,180 --> 01:39:47,270
Speak!

1059
01:39:48,680 --> 01:39:51,680
The program 'Smith' has grown beyond your control.

1060
01:39:51,710 --> 01:39:55,100
Soon he will spread through this city as he spread through the Matrix.

1061
01:39:55,180 --> 01:39:57,940
You cannot stop him.

1062
01:39:58,790 --> 01:40:00,020
But I can.

1063
01:40:00,030 --> 01:40:02,200
We don't need you.

1064
01:40:02,280 --> 01:40:05,410
We need nothing.

1065
01:40:05,490 --> 01:40:07,480
If that's true, then I've made a mistake.

1066
01:40:07,560 --> 01:40:10,160
And you should kill me now.

1067
01:40:14,520 --> 01:40:16,060
What do you want?

1068
01:40:17,900 --> 01:40:19,530
Peace.

1069
01:40:44,840 --> 01:40:47,030
What are they doing?

1070
01:40:52,380 --> 01:40:54,550
What are you doing!?

1071
01:40:57,110 --> 01:40:58,930
Morpheus!

1072
01:41:23,830 --> 01:41:26,470
And if you fail?

1073
01:41:28,100 --> 01:41:29,630
I won't.

1074
01:41:51,100 --> 01:41:52,190
Neo.

1075
01:41:53,300 --> 01:41:55,460
He fights for us.

1076
01:42:36,490 --> 01:42:39,410
Mr. Anderson, welcome back.

1077
01:42:39,790 --> 01:42:42,300
We missed you.

1078
01:42:46,060 --> 01:42:49,300
You like what I've done with the place?

1079
01:42:49,550 --> 01:42:51,790
It ends tonight.

1080
01:42:52,170 --> 01:42:55,210
I know it does. I've seen it.

1081
01:42:55,280 --> 01:42:59,380
That's why the rest of me is just going to enjoy the show.

1082
01:42:59,490 --> 01:43:03,930
We already know that I'm the one that beats you.

1083
01:44:55,130 --> 01:44:57,910
Can you feel it Mr. Anderson?

1084
01:44:58,270 --> 01:45:00,600
Closing in on you.

1085
01:45:00,900 --> 01:45:02,700
Oh, I can.

1086
01:45:04,380 --> 01:45:08,490
I really should thank you for it, after all, it was your life...

1087
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:12,020
...that taught me the purpose of all life.

1088
01:45:12,850 --> 01:45:16,030
The purpose of life is to end.

1089
01:48:52,010 --> 01:48:54,910
Why Mr. Anderson? Why?

1090
01:48:55,370 --> 01:48:56,240
Why?

1091
01:48:58,070 --> 01:48:59,530
Why do you do it?

1092
01:49:00,180 --> 01:49:02,080
Why? Why get up?

1093
01:49:02,270 --> 01:49:04,830
Why keep fighting?

1094
01:49:05,890 --> 01:49:10,910
Do you believe you're fighting for something? For more than your survival?

1095
01:49:11,230 --> 01:49:15,230
Can you tell me what it is? Do you even know?

1096
01:49:17,940 --> 01:49:19,810
Is it freedom or truth?

1097
01:49:19,890 --> 01:49:22,230
Perhaps peace? Could it be for love?

1098
01:49:22,430 --> 01:49:26,040
Illusions Mr. Anderson, vagaries of perception.

1099
01:49:26,210 --> 01:49:30,940
Temporary constructs of a feeble human intellect trying desperately to justify...

1100
01:49:30,980 --> 01:49:34,270
...an existance that is without meaning or purpose.

1101
01:49:34,420 --> 01:49:38,120
And all of them as artificial as the Matrix itself.

1102
01:49:38,240 --> 01:49:43,800
Although, only a human mind could invent something as insipid as love.

1103
01:49:46,830 --> 01:49:48,860
You must be able to see it, Mr. Anderson.

1104
01:49:48,930 --> 01:49:50,270
You must know it by now!

1105
01:49:50,350 --> 01:49:53,540
You can't win, it's pointless to keep fighting!

1106
01:49:55,590 --> 01:49:57,500
Why Mr. Anderson?

1107
01:49:57,580 --> 01:50:00,720
Why? Why do you persist?

1108
01:50:02,860 --> 01:50:05,430
Because I choose to.

1109
01:51:10,250 --> 01:51:11,710
This is my world!

1110
01:51:11,750 --> 01:51:13,080
My world!

1111
01:51:37,680 --> 01:51:38,810
Wait.

1112
01:51:39,630 --> 01:51:41,910
I've seen this.

1113
01:51:42,920 --> 01:51:45,790
This is it, this is the end.

1114
01:51:47,110 --> 01:51:48,430
Yes.

1115
01:51:48,490 --> 01:51:51,710
You were laying right there, just like that.

1116
01:51:51,940 --> 01:51:56,070
And I... I stand here, right here.

1117
01:51:56,090 --> 01:51:58,900
I'm... I'm supposed to say something.

1118
01:51:59,540 --> 01:52:01,320
I say...

1119
01:52:01,610 --> 01:52:05,650
Everything that has a beginning has an end, Neo.

1120
01:52:13,720 --> 01:52:14,680
What?

1121
01:52:15,370 --> 01:52:17,880
What did I just say?

1122
01:52:22,900 --> 01:52:23,740
No.

1123
01:52:23,930 --> 01:52:27,110
No, this isn't right, this can't be right.

1124
01:52:33,910 --> 01:52:35,650
Get away from me!

1125
01:52:35,900 --> 01:52:37,700
What are you afraid of?

1126
01:52:37,960 --> 01:52:39,870
It's a trick!

1127
01:52:40,180 --> 01:52:42,120
You were right, Smith.

1128
01:52:43,350 --> 01:52:46,150
You were always right.

1129
01:52:48,440 --> 01:52:51,000
It was inevitable.

1130
01:53:21,630 --> 01:53:24,390
Is it over?

1131
01:53:54,580 --> 01:53:56,460
Oh, no, no, no.

1132
01:53:56,570 --> 01:53:59,160
No, it's not fair.

1133
01:54:52,510 --> 01:54:55,010
It is done.

1134
01:55:27,290 --> 01:55:29,150
It doesn't make sense.

1135
01:55:33,400 --> 01:55:35,000
He did it.

1136
01:55:36,050 --> 01:55:37,780
He saved us.

1137
01:55:38,480 --> 01:55:39,550
He saved us.

1138
01:55:41,380 --> 01:55:43,920
He did it! He did it!

1139
01:55:44,570 --> 01:55:45,380
He did it!

1140
01:55:45,450 --> 01:55:47,060
He did it! It's over!

1141
01:55:47,710 --> 01:55:48,290
It's over! He did it!

1142
01:55:48,480 --> 01:55:50,010
He did it! What is it? What happened?

1143
01:55:50,080 --> 01:55:50,890
Sir...

1144
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:52,380
He did it, Sir! Neo! He did it!

1145
01:55:52,460 --> 01:55:54,020
Did what? He ended the war!

1146
01:55:54,060 --> 01:55:55,290
The machines are gone!!

1147
01:55:56,430 --> 01:55:58,290
The war is over, Sir! The war is over!

1148
01:56:01,190 --> 01:56:02,180
Zion!

1149
01:56:03,120 --> 01:56:06,180
Zion! It's over!

1150
01:56:06,720 --> 01:56:08,170
It's over!

1151
01:56:08,510 --> 01:56:10,270
The war is over!

1152
01:56:11,380 --> 01:56:13,230
The war is over!

1153
01:56:35,630 --> 01:56:38,460
I have imagined this moment...

1154
01:56:38,990 --> 01:56:41,270
...for so long.

1155
01:56:44,560 --> 01:56:47,560
Is this real?

1156
01:56:55,730 --> 01:56:58,890
Neo, wherever you are.

1157
01:56:59,610 --> 01:57:01,720
Thank you.

1158
01:57:45,680 --> 01:57:46,870
Good morning.

1159
01:58:08,110 --> 01:58:09,580
Well, now...

1160
01:58:09,690 --> 01:58:12,280
...ain't this a surprise?

1161
01:58:12,370 --> 01:58:14,750
You played a very dangerous game.

1162
01:58:14,770 --> 01:58:16,980
Change always is.

1163
01:58:17,030 --> 01:58:21,550
Just how long do you think this peace is going to last?

1164
01:58:21,920 --> 01:58:25,230
As long as it can.

1165
01:58:27,750 --> 01:58:30,070
What about the others?

1166
01:58:31,330 --> 01:58:32,800
What others?

1167
01:58:32,830 --> 01:58:35,080
The ones that want out.

1168
01:58:35,390 --> 01:58:38,190
Obviously they will be freed.

1169
01:58:38,290 --> 01:58:40,460
I have your word?

1170
01:58:40,540 --> 01:58:41,840
What do you think I am?

1171
01:58:41,860 --> 01:58:42,830
Human?

1172
01:58:57,610 --> 01:58:58,990
Oracle!

1173
01:59:06,090 --> 01:59:10,770
We were afraid we might not find you. Everything's okay now.

1174
01:59:11,640 --> 01:59:16,440
Look! Look! Just look at that!

1175
01:59:17,020 --> 01:59:19,240
Beautiful!

1176
01:59:20,350 --> 01:59:24,950
Did you do that? For Neo.

1177
01:59:25,880 --> 01:59:28,010
That's nice!

1178
01:59:28,040 --> 01:59:30,020
I know he'd love it.

1179
01:59:30,360 --> 01:59:32,930
Will we ever see him again?

1180
01:59:33,030 --> 01:59:35,670
I suspect so.

1181
01:59:35,890 --> 01:59:38,130
Someday.

1182
01:59:42,440 --> 01:59:44,400
Did you always know?

1183
01:59:44,450 --> 01:59:47,200
Oh, no. No I didn't.

1184
01:59:48,240 --> 01:59:50,520
But I believed.

1185
01:59:51,640 --> 01:59:54,170
I believed.
