00:00:38,037 --> 00:00:40,112
George, George,
George of the Jungle

3
00:00:40,205 --> 00:00:42,364
George, George,
George of the Jungle

4
00:00:42,457 --> 00:00:44,663
George, George,
George of the Jungle

5
00:00:44,751 --> 00:00:46,827
Strong as he can be

6
00:00:49,296 --> 00:00:51,123
Watch out for that tree

7
00:00:51,549 --> 00:00:53,920
George, George,
George of the Jungle

8
00:00:54,009 --> 00:00:55,752
Lives a life that's free

9
00:00:58,095 --> 00:01:00,053
Watch out for that tree

10
00:01:00,181 --> 00:01:01,343
When he gets in a scrape

11
00:01:01,431 --> 00:01:05,808
He makes his escape with help
from his friend an ape named Ape

12
00:01:05,894 --> 00:01:08,052
And his elephant Shep
can fetch a log

13
00:01:08,146 --> 00:01:10,850
He's man's best friend
is George's dog

14
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,774
He's George, George,
George of the Jungle

15
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:15,935
Swing from tree to tree

16
00:01:18,613 --> 00:01:20,522
Watch out for that tree

17
00:01:20,615 --> 00:01:22,773
George, George,
George of the Jungle

18
00:01:22,866 --> 00:01:24,859
Lives a life that's free

19
00:01:27,245 --> 00:01:29,368
Watch out for that tree

20
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:31,697
Now George was a king
and a daddy too

21
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:34,281
There's just too much
for poor George to do

22
00:01:34,793 --> 00:01:37,284
Though George loved Ursula
with all his heart

23
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:39,916
Her momma's evil plots
broke them apart

24
00:01:40,632 --> 00:01:43,087
There was lying and thieving
and stealing and cheating

25
00:01:43,175 --> 00:01:45,666
But their true love
just can't be beaten

26
00:01:46,386 --> 00:01:48,758
So find his kisskin unhypnotised

27
00:01:48,847 --> 00:01:50,886
Now George is the king from 9-5

28
00:01:53,643 --> 00:01:55,385
George, George,
George of the Jungle

29
00:01:55,477 --> 00:01:57,185
Friend to you and me

30
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:02,513
Watch out for that tree

31
00:02:02,609 --> 00:02:04,268
Hear him holler, swing and sing

32
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,146
All the animals come
to the jungle king

33
00:02:07,237 --> 00:02:09,693
So grab a vine and swing in time

34
00:02:09,781 --> 00:02:12,236
If you smack a tree just pay no mind

35
00:02:12,742 --> 00:02:15,528
Like George, George,
George of the Jungle

36
00:02:15,619 --> 00:02:17,861
George, George,
George of the Jungle

37
00:02:17,955 --> 00:02:20,113
George, George,
George of the Jungle

38
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:22,283
Strong as he can be

39
00:02:25,002 --> 00:02:26,995
Watch out for that tree

40
00:02:27,088 --> 00:02:30,041
Watch out for that... tree

41
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,133
George, George,
George of the Jungle

42
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,928
Watch out for that tree

43
00:02:38,014 --> 00:02:42,924
The jungle to the untrained eye
looks the same as in our first movie,

44
00:02:43,018 --> 00:02:45,093
but things have changed,

45
00:02:45,186 --> 00:02:48,223
and it's not just because
we're using a different set,

46
00:02:48,314 --> 00:02:51,315
domestic bliss
has broken out over the Bukuvu,

47
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,480
parenthood has found
that defender of the innocent,

48
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:59,733
and all-around good guy,
George of the Jungle.

49
00:02:59,824 --> 00:03:02,231
George, George,
George of the Jungle

50
00:03:02,326 --> 00:03:04,402
Watch out for that tree

51
00:03:05,244 --> 00:03:07,202
And as our story begins,

52
00:03:07,288 --> 00:03:11,535
our popular potent potentate
has produced a prince.

53
00:03:12,335 --> 00:03:14,207
Huh? Wait a minute!

54
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:15,836
Who the heck are you?!

55
00:03:15,921 --> 00:03:19,455
Me, new George. Studio too cheap
to pay Brendan Fraser.

56
00:03:20,425 --> 00:03:22,796
- Let's go, Dad.
- How did you get the part?

57
00:03:22,885 --> 00:03:26,383
- New George just lucky, I guess.
- Hey, dad, check it out.

58
00:03:26,471 --> 00:03:28,547
Let's play fetch with Shep.

59
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,721
- Shep!

60
00:03:35,812 --> 00:03:38,100
Here we go, boy. Fetch!

61
00:03:39,482 --> 00:03:41,522
Fetch stick, Shep.

62
00:03:41,609 --> 00:03:43,400
Come on, Shep.

63
00:03:46,738 --> 00:03:49,443
Now that the prince is turning five,

64
00:03:49,533 --> 00:03:53,197
George is grooming his son
to be the heir to the throne.

65
00:03:53,286 --> 00:03:59,702
George, that's grooming him
to be heir, not grooming his hair.

66
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:02,282
- Oh.
- Oh, yeah.

67
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:05,451
While George was preparing his son,

68
00:04:05,546 --> 00:04:07,621
Ursula the love of his life,

69
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:11,129
and the heiress who gave up
everything to be his jungle queen,

70
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:14,551
was wondering why
George wasn't home for lunch.

71
00:04:14,637 --> 00:04:16,594
Why isn't George home for lunch?

72
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,006
But George
couldn't go home for lunch

73
00:04:19,099 --> 00:04:22,799
because he had to attend
to a very important matter.

74
00:04:23,894 --> 00:04:26,564
George pretty good at coconut ball.

75
00:04:28,315 --> 00:04:29,394
OK.

76
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,563
OK.

77
00:05:28,324 --> 00:05:29,699
Hit me!

78
00:05:51,802 --> 00:05:56,713
But suddenly the game was
interrupted by an urgent bongo gram.

79
00:05:57,599 --> 00:06:01,299
I said, an urgent bongo gram.

80
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:09,308
George really late for lunch.

81
00:06:09,401 --> 00:06:11,357
George, George,
George of the Jungle

82
00:06:11,444 --> 00:06:13,733
Strong as he can be

83
00:06:16,073 --> 00:06:19,856
Watch out for that... tree

84
00:06:20,785 --> 00:06:25,162
Sorry George late, but George had
important royal duty to attend to.

85
00:06:25,247 --> 00:06:27,820
In other words,
you were playing coconut ball.

86
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:29,873
George score winning goal.

87
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,248
Ursula come
and try out for cheerleader?

88
00:06:32,336 --> 00:06:36,334
I tried, but the gorillas turned me
down because I wasn't pretty enough.

89
00:06:37,633 --> 00:06:41,844
- You look pretty to me.
- You should tell the gorillas.

90
00:06:41,928 --> 00:06:45,795
George promise tonight
spend whole night with Ursula. OK?

91
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:47,135
OK.

92
00:06:48,059 --> 00:06:50,549
Can George give Junior
vine swinging lesson?

93
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:53,313
Vine swinging's a little dangerous.

94
00:06:54,355 --> 00:06:59,598
- Must be from your side of family.
- Vine surfing is much cooler.

95
00:06:59,694 --> 00:07:02,978
What dangerous about swinging?
Swinging fun.

96
00:07:03,071 --> 00:07:06,938
- George show you.
- Maybe that's not such a good idea.

97
00:07:07,033 --> 00:07:09,025
Why? Lt easy.

98
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:18,449
George, watch out for that...

99
00:07:18,542 --> 00:07:20,998
For the first time in history,

100
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:24,289
George didn't hit the tree
he was aiming at,

101
00:07:24,673 --> 00:07:29,085
but that didn't stop him
from hitting... the second tree.

102
00:07:30,594 --> 00:07:32,172
And, in case you were worried,

103
00:07:32,263 --> 00:07:36,556
the new George takes a tree
as well as Brendan Fraser.

104
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,761
While George
was sliding down the tree,

105
00:07:43,856 --> 00:07:47,520
Ape has been in Las Vegas
becoming a different sort of swinger.

106
00:07:47,609 --> 00:07:49,767
But while pursuing
his singing career,

107
00:07:49,861 --> 00:07:55,150
the lure of the cards has proven too
much for our travelling troubadour.

108
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,731
You got to learn to play it right

109
00:07:57,826 --> 00:08:01,360
You got to know when to hold 'em

110
00:08:01,454 --> 00:08:03,031
Know when to fold 'em

111
00:08:03,122 --> 00:08:06,289
If you wouldn't mind,
could you stop singing?

112
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:08,034
Sorry.

113
00:08:08,668 --> 00:08:10,744
Cut the cards.

114
00:08:14,423 --> 00:08:16,629
Welcome to Las Vegas, baby.

115
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,297
And they say humans
are more evolved.

116
00:08:20,386 --> 00:08:22,426
Meanwhile, back in the jungle,

117
00:08:22,514 --> 00:08:26,297
George was taking care
of some serious jungle business.

118
00:08:26,392 --> 00:08:29,262
George, the sink's stuffed again.

119
00:08:29,352 --> 00:08:31,511
Well, kind of serious.

120
00:08:31,605 --> 00:08:33,597
Don't worry, George fix.

121
00:08:39,194 --> 00:08:40,652
OK.

122
00:09:12,681 --> 00:09:15,634
George, you better answer the bird.

123
00:09:21,147 --> 00:09:22,806
Hello.

124
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:27,976
Animals in big fight.

125
00:09:28,069 --> 00:09:31,733
George know he promise Ursula
he see her tonight,

126
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:34,866
OK if George go to help animals?

127
00:09:42,289 --> 00:09:47,246
If George can come home early, would
Ursula still go out with George?

128
00:09:55,133 --> 00:09:57,090
George, George,
George of the Jungle

129
00:09:57,177 --> 00:09:59,584
George, George,
George of the Jungle

130
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:00,793
Watch out for that...

131
00:10:16,067 --> 00:10:18,144
Stop the movie!

132
00:10:18,237 --> 00:10:20,561
That's how animals usually sound,
right?

133
00:10:20,655 --> 00:10:23,406
In our movie the animals
are all going to talk,

134
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:27,701
- so you humans don't miss a thing.
- Where's your team now?

135
00:10:27,786 --> 00:10:29,577
Anyone know how to fix sink?

136
00:10:30,914 --> 00:10:34,033
For the convenience of you animals
we've added subtitles,

137
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:36,247
so you can follow along too.

138
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:37,959
This is all their fault.

139
00:10:38,045 --> 00:10:41,330
The birds keep dropping
their zug-zug on us.

140
00:10:41,422 --> 00:10:43,083
Incoming.

141
00:10:45,676 --> 00:10:48,345
It's disgusting! I gotta wear a hat!

142
00:10:48,428 --> 00:10:50,088
Why not make zug-zug treaty?

143
00:10:50,931 --> 00:10:52,389
Zug-zug treaty?

144
00:10:52,473 --> 00:10:54,881
Yes, zug-zug treaty.

145
00:10:54,976 --> 00:10:58,178
This is Disney,
if we're gonna do a zug-zug joke,

146
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:00,512
we're gonna make it educational.

147
00:11:00,605 --> 00:11:04,188
We make treaty and get everyone
to go zug-zug in separate areas.

148
00:11:04,276 --> 00:11:07,940
- That's a good idea.
- Now you can play coconut ball.

149
00:11:08,029 --> 00:11:11,397
- George can't stay.
- And why not, George?

150
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:13,814
Have evening planned with Ursula.

151
00:11:13,908 --> 00:11:17,775
When lions ruled the jungle,
we never neglected our subjects,

152
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:20,242
why are you neglecting us?

153
00:11:20,331 --> 00:11:24,458
- George in love.
- You've gotta be kidding me.

154
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:26,534
Get outta here.

155
00:11:26,627 --> 00:11:28,501
Run home to your family.

156
00:11:28,588 --> 00:11:31,339
Never trust anyone without fangs.

157
00:11:35,135 --> 00:11:38,254
George didn't impress
his bachelor pals,

158
00:11:38,345 --> 00:11:41,216
but he did manage
to impress his wife.

159
00:11:41,307 --> 00:11:42,800
George lucky man.

160
00:11:42,891 --> 00:11:45,050
He's got Ursula and Junior...

161
00:11:47,145 --> 00:11:49,221
...and really strong head.

162
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:55,475
Honey, I wouldn't worry
about Junior swinging.

163
00:11:55,568 --> 00:11:59,102
He's the son of the greatest swinger
of all time,

164
00:11:59,196 --> 00:12:01,688
how could he not learn how to swing?

165
00:12:02,783 --> 00:12:04,574
That make George happy.

166
00:12:07,245 --> 00:12:08,869
Sorry about sink.

167
00:12:08,955 --> 00:12:10,746
It's not your fault,

168
00:12:10,832 --> 00:12:14,496
it's just the way
things are sometimes.

169
00:12:14,585 --> 00:12:17,870
Sure Ursula like being here
with George?

170
00:12:17,963 --> 00:12:19,504
How can you say that?

171
00:12:19,589 --> 00:12:22,294
Then Ursula think things be OK,
right?

172
00:12:22,383 --> 00:12:25,336
Cos George rather not be king
than lose Ursula.

173
00:12:25,427 --> 00:12:29,674
Oh, don't be silly,
everything's fine.

174
00:12:31,516 --> 00:12:35,762
George hope so, cos he love Ursula
more than there are stars in sky.

175
00:12:37,604 --> 00:12:41,553
And George have special surprise
to cheer Ursula up.

176
00:13:00,374 --> 00:13:03,208
Ursula, dance with George.

177
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,874
Like a simple question
looking for an answer

178
00:13:07,963 --> 00:13:13,253
Now I am, now I am,
listening to some inner call

179
00:13:13,342 --> 00:13:17,553
Swimming blindly to pull
myself upon your shore

180
00:13:17,638 --> 00:13:22,382
What if I don't find you
when I have landed?

181
00:13:22,475 --> 00:13:26,769
Would you leave me here to die
on your shores flat dead?

182
00:13:26,854 --> 00:13:29,973
I think I know why the dog
howls at the moon

183
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:35,065
I think I know why the dog
howls at the moon

184
00:13:35,528 --> 00:13:43,238
I said

185
00:13:43,326 --> 00:13:45,403
When I'm with you...

186
00:13:45,495 --> 00:13:47,986
George and Ursula were in love.

187
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,034
Little did they know that someone
was approaching,

188
00:13:51,124 --> 00:13:54,079
who was going to change their lives
for ever,

189
00:13:54,169 --> 00:13:58,380
someone so malevolent,
so Machiavellian, so...

190
00:13:58,464 --> 00:14:02,627
Well, for you kids, let's just say
really, really mean.

191
00:14:03,135 --> 00:14:06,504
Stay still, I don't want to fall off.

192
00:14:06,597 --> 00:14:11,886
Yes, it was Beatrice Stanhope,
Ursula's mother.

193
00:14:16,062 --> 00:14:17,094
Hello.

194
00:14:17,188 --> 00:14:20,557
It's the man who would be
your son-in-law.

195
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:25,607
Yes, that's Ursula's foppish
former fiancé, Lyle Van de Groot.

196
00:14:25,696 --> 00:14:30,191
You remember the graceful
Van de Groot from the first movie.

197
00:14:34,745 --> 00:14:37,318
Was it really necessary
to show that scene?

198
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:42,161
Lt seems the vengeful,
venal Van de Groot

199
00:14:42,251 --> 00:14:44,920
had bought the casino
Ape was gambling in.

200
00:14:45,003 --> 00:14:47,921
Lyle had finally come up
with the perfect plan

201
00:14:48,007 --> 00:14:52,217
to destroy George by stealing
the deed to Ape Mountain.

202
00:14:52,301 --> 00:14:54,543
Are you sure Ape has the deed?

203
00:14:54,637 --> 00:14:58,337
Lt is, after all,
called Ape Mountain.

204
00:14:58,432 --> 00:15:02,096
And as soon as I have cheated
the ape out of the deed,

205
00:15:02,185 --> 00:15:07,808
and driven that half-wit George
off of his land, bulldozers roll,

206
00:15:07,898 --> 00:15:10,733
driving Ursula right back
into my waiting arms.

207
00:15:10,817 --> 00:15:12,359
When they see my gifts,

208
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:16,906
they'll miss civilisation so much
they'll beg me to take them back.

209
00:15:20,663 --> 00:15:23,415
I've gotta go. What did he say?

210
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,992
He said hold on. I'm going to...

211
00:15:30,593 --> 00:15:32,502
Oh, I've had it!

212
00:15:34,972 --> 00:15:38,841
Are you sure
we're going in the right direction?

213
00:15:38,936 --> 00:15:41,724
Why, yes.
We remember from the first movie.

214
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:44,567
It's very important
I get to Ape Mountain today.

215
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:47,191
It's my grandson's fifth birthday.

216
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,902
I'm taking him and Ursula
back to civilisation.

217
00:15:52,746 --> 00:15:54,489
What did he say?

218
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:57,950
He was admiring your luggage.

219
00:15:58,044 --> 00:15:59,503
Oh, well, whatever.

220
00:15:59,588 --> 00:16:03,336
And he wondered why you want to
take your grandson out of the jungle.

221
00:16:03,426 --> 00:16:06,878
I'm not having him grow up here
an illiterate savage.

222
00:16:21,407 --> 00:16:23,566
Someone help! Put me down! Help!

223
00:16:30,042 --> 00:16:32,665
Sorry, we can't kill Beatrice.

224
00:16:32,755 --> 00:16:35,127
If she dies, we have no story.

225
00:16:35,216 --> 00:16:39,297
And if we have no story, George
couldn't disappoint his wife again

226
00:16:39,388 --> 00:16:43,469
by being late
for his own son's birthday party.

227
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:47,473
I wonder what's keeping your father.

228
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:51,851
Guess we may as well get started.

229
00:16:51,945 --> 00:16:56,276
Now remember, sweetie,
you can wish for anything you want.

230
00:16:56,368 --> 00:16:59,820
Except your grandmother,
because she's already here.

231
00:16:59,914 --> 00:17:01,456
Grandma!

232
00:17:02,792 --> 00:17:05,082
- Mother!
- Darling.

233
00:17:08,716 --> 00:17:12,383
Hello, Junior.
Well, where's that husband of yours?

234
00:17:12,471 --> 00:17:15,924
Shouldn't he be
at his own son's birthday party?

235
00:17:16,018 --> 00:17:18,307
He's running late.

236
00:17:18,396 --> 00:17:22,311
How could he possibly
be running late? This is the jungle.

237
00:17:22,401 --> 00:17:25,319
Traffic back up
on the Bukuvu Expressway?

238
00:17:27,658 --> 00:17:29,734
Dad!

239
00:17:39,339 --> 00:17:44,548
George sorry he's late, but zug-zug
treaty broke down and had to step in.

240
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:54,353
Hello, old Mrs Ursula.

241
00:17:56,861 --> 00:18:02,402
Beatrice cunningly connived to tempt
Ursula and Junior back home

242
00:18:02,493 --> 00:18:06,160
using a ploy that has worked
since the beginning of time.

243
00:18:06,248 --> 00:18:09,084
I have gifts for you.

244
00:18:13,841 --> 00:18:15,917
Mother, you shouldn't have.

245
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:19,797
George also make present.

246
00:18:23,478 --> 00:18:25,555
Cool! Thanks, Dad.

247
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:33,359
Whoa! Cool, a spear!

248
00:18:33,449 --> 00:18:34,860
- That's nice.
- Yeah.

249
00:18:34,951 --> 00:18:37,525
How'd you like to play with this?

250
00:18:41,626 --> 00:18:43,702
Wow!

251
00:18:52,849 --> 00:18:57,761
You just flip the switch
and it can do anything you want.

252
00:18:57,855 --> 00:18:59,931
That not look so hard.

253
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:20,840
Beatrice put in motion
her gift-giving gambit

254
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:22,635
to get Ursula to come home.

255
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,134
Meanwhile, George demonstrated
why he was no William Tell.

256
00:19:27,225 --> 00:19:32,268
- And neither was his aimless son.
- Stay there. OK. Good. OK.

257
00:19:32,357 --> 00:19:34,896
OK, aim. Good.

258
00:19:34,986 --> 00:19:36,646
See gorilla? OK.

259
00:19:36,738 --> 00:19:38,896
Now throw. Throw.

260
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:40,320
Throw!

261
00:19:41,828 --> 00:19:43,619
Good.

262
00:19:44,497 --> 00:19:46,740
Huh?

263
00:19:56,430 --> 00:20:00,973
But a coconut wasn't enough to
nullify the muddled mind of our hero,

264
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:05,770
George continued to be torn by the
conflict between home and throne.

265
00:20:05,858 --> 00:20:10,521
Come on, George. Ya have to
supervise the oo-oo feather picking.

266
00:20:10,614 --> 00:20:14,447
Sorry, George can't.
Promise Ursula he stay home.

267
00:20:14,536 --> 00:20:17,787
But no king has ever missed
oo-oo feather picking.

268
00:20:17,874 --> 00:20:20,330
At least not when lions ruled.

269
00:20:22,379 --> 00:20:25,381
Face it.
He doesn't care about us anymore.

270
00:20:25,466 --> 00:20:29,168
- George.
- Old Mrs Ursula.

271
00:20:29,263 --> 00:20:30,923
Come talk.

272
00:20:35,938 --> 00:20:39,354
George,
do you love your wife and your son?

273
00:20:39,442 --> 00:20:42,112
George love Ursula and Junior
very much.

274
00:20:42,196 --> 00:20:46,527
And George sorry George late
for Junior's birthday party.

275
00:20:46,618 --> 00:20:49,026
I understand perfectly.

276
00:20:49,121 --> 00:20:52,076
You don't have enough time
for your subjects or family

277
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:57,163
Which is why you can see how much
happier Ursula and Junior would be

278
00:20:57,257 --> 00:20:59,748
if they came back to San Francisco.

279
00:20:59,843 --> 00:21:02,382
Ursula's lonely.

280
00:21:02,472 --> 00:21:07,550
She misses her friends and
someplace to wear lovely dresses.

281
00:21:07,645 --> 00:21:13,519
Junior needs to live in civilisation
and go to school with other children.

282
00:21:13,611 --> 00:21:16,102
What do you think George should do?

283
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:21,120
George should let them go.

284
00:21:38,684 --> 00:21:40,677
As much as she tried to resist,

285
00:21:40,771 --> 00:21:45,516
the once opulent Ursula was tempted
by the bangles and baubles.

286
00:21:45,609 --> 00:21:47,769
Feeling dazed and confused,

287
00:21:48,071 --> 00:21:50,942
or more dazed and confused
than normal,

288
00:21:51,033 --> 00:21:53,655
George sought professional help.

289
00:22:15,272 --> 00:22:19,437
George know Tookie trying,
but need talk to brother Ape.

290
00:22:20,112 --> 00:22:22,734
Maybe Tookie fly to get brother Ape?

291
00:22:30,207 --> 00:22:32,284
Then George just talk more.

292
00:22:36,258 --> 00:22:40,042
While Tookie was winging his way
to Las Vegas, he...

293
00:22:40,137 --> 00:22:43,388
I said Las Vegas!

294
00:22:45,435 --> 00:22:47,844
Ape found himself
with problems of his own.

295
00:22:47,939 --> 00:22:49,979
If you're gonna play the game, boy

296
00:22:50,066 --> 00:22:52,641
You got to learn to play it right

297
00:22:52,737 --> 00:22:55,738
You got to know when to hold 'em

298
00:22:55,823 --> 00:22:59,075
Know when to fold...

299
00:22:59,161 --> 00:23:04,323
I've had more pleasure
listening to alligators sing

300
00:23:04,418 --> 00:23:06,707
than you, ya stupid bum!

301
00:23:06,796 --> 00:23:10,380
While Ape was busy strangling
his pestering poker partner,

302
00:23:10,467 --> 00:23:14,133
Tookie's tuckered mind
began to wander.

303
00:23:17,059 --> 00:23:19,016
Another mimosa, Mr Tookie-Tookie?

304
00:23:20,439 --> 00:23:22,348
Oh, Tookie, you cad.

305
00:23:22,441 --> 00:23:25,811
As our jungle jet-setter
flew to visit his primate pal,

306
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:30,566
Ursula confronted Beatrice
for befuddling her handsome hubby.

307
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:34,740
Mother. I'd appreciate it if you
wouldn't play with George's mind.

308
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:38,617
Well, there really isn't much
to play with, but alright.

309
00:23:38,711 --> 00:23:41,167
Ursula, I know you're unhappy here.

310
00:23:41,256 --> 00:23:43,962
You can't fool your mother.

311
00:23:44,052 --> 00:23:47,255
I'll admit there are certain things
I miss about home,

312
00:23:47,347 --> 00:23:49,839
but I love George
and I am staying here.

313
00:23:49,934 --> 00:23:52,425
So deal with it. OK?

314
00:23:59,613 --> 00:24:02,817
- Hello.
- Ursula's definitely weakening.

315
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:05,911
If I can just get her back
to civilisation and to you -

316
00:24:05,996 --> 00:24:09,994
That is, if you've got your obsession
with her under control?

317
00:24:10,085 --> 00:24:14,463
Of course I have it under control.

318
00:24:14,548 --> 00:24:18,132
Obsession... a strong word.

319
00:24:18,762 --> 00:24:21,004
Have you got the deed from Ape yet?

320
00:24:21,099 --> 00:24:25,311
No, but I'll have it tonight.

321
00:24:25,395 --> 00:24:29,809
And when I do, bulldozers will roll.

322
00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:35,067
Roll! I have a foolproof plan.

323
00:24:36,117 --> 00:24:41,575
He did. Because in a demonstration
of despicable dishonesty,

324
00:24:41,666 --> 00:24:44,075
Lyle had entered the poker game.

325
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:47,707
See if you can figure out
which one he is.

326
00:24:55,893 --> 00:24:59,096
You foolish fowl.
What are you doing here?

327
00:25:01,149 --> 00:25:04,435
George is suffering
deep psychological damage

328
00:25:04,528 --> 00:25:09,322
over whether Ursula's happy and
if he's a good husband and king,

329
00:25:09,409 --> 00:25:13,989
and he's in need
of my immediate advice and counsel?

330
00:25:15,334 --> 00:25:18,122
In a moment!
I'm sitting on a great hand here!

331
00:25:22,552 --> 00:25:27,131
Yes, the gambling bug had bit
our normally guarded gorilla.

332
00:25:27,223 --> 00:25:30,475
I'll take three.
Maybe my luck will change.

333
00:25:30,561 --> 00:25:34,145
But luck wasn't in the cards
for our poker-playing primate.

334
00:25:34,233 --> 00:25:36,273
As the game progressed,

335
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,603
there was a strange sense
in the room

336
00:25:38,697 --> 00:25:42,197
that Ape was about
to be cheated out of the deed.

337
00:25:56,553 --> 00:26:01,549
I'd like to stay in, but I have
nothing left to bet. I'm broke.

338
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:03,719
Maybe you have something of value?

339
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:09,484
Stocks, bonds,
real estate... in Africa?

340
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:11,277
I'm afraid not.

341
00:26:11,363 --> 00:26:14,531
Don't you own...

342
00:26:14,617 --> 00:26:19,281
Oh, what's it called, Ape Mountain?

343
00:26:19,373 --> 00:26:24,120
No, the deed belongs to the legendary
George of the Jungle.

344
00:26:24,213 --> 00:26:25,921
Perhaps you've heard of him?

345
00:26:26,007 --> 00:26:28,083
Vaguely.

346
00:26:29,178 --> 00:26:34,055
So, what are you holding,
Nostril-damus?

347
00:26:34,143 --> 00:26:38,354
There. Just four queens.

348
00:26:38,439 --> 00:26:43,601
Well, I'm holding four Lyles.

349
00:26:43,696 --> 00:26:47,777
But don't you worry your pretty
little hairy head about it.

350
00:26:47,868 --> 00:26:55,248
You can work off the debt performing
in my club... for the next 17 years.

351
00:27:12,691 --> 00:27:14,352
What?

352
00:27:15,403 --> 00:27:16,814
Hello.

353
00:27:16,904 --> 00:27:20,606
Lt turns out the big ape
didn't have the deed.

354
00:27:20,701 --> 00:27:23,988
How could Ape
not own Ape Mountain?

355
00:27:24,081 --> 00:27:28,209
That's like saying the Rockefellers
don't own Rockefeller Center.

356
00:27:28,294 --> 00:27:30,371
- They don't!
- Oh.

357
00:27:31,924 --> 00:27:34,712
Lt turns out
your idiot son-in-law has it.

358
00:27:34,803 --> 00:27:37,211
But where does he keep it?

359
00:27:37,306 --> 00:27:38,966
Let me ask him.

360
00:27:39,725 --> 00:27:43,890
George, where do you keep
the deed to Ape Mountain?

361
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,641
George hide in butt flap.

362
00:27:46,484 --> 00:27:49,651
Enchanting.
He keeps it in his underwear.

363
00:27:49,738 --> 00:27:56,074
How do we get him and his underwear
back here... so I can take it?

364
00:27:59,584 --> 00:28:00,615
Tookie.

365
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:08,792
Ape can't come talk to George
because broke? In big trouble?

366
00:28:08,888 --> 00:28:10,797
George must go Vegas to help.

367
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:16,597
Thrilled that George was leaving,
Beatrice beamed like a Cheshire cat.

368
00:28:21,278 --> 00:28:22,903
George is coming.

369
00:28:22,988 --> 00:28:25,445
What's he doing
with all that luggage?

370
00:28:25,534 --> 00:28:27,325
Hey, he's leaving.

371
00:28:27,411 --> 00:28:30,911
It's comments like that
which justify why I eat you.

372
00:28:30,999 --> 00:28:34,285
Now I know why they call you
Really Mean Lion.

373
00:28:34,378 --> 00:28:36,122
Oh, yeah.

374
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:39,749
Last time he left,
the jungle nearly fell apart.

375
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:48,802
It's so obvious, George only wants
to be with his own kind now.

376
00:28:48,896 --> 00:28:52,730
But don't worry,
I'll take care of you.

377
00:28:54,946 --> 00:28:57,104
Unaware of the threat
home and abroad,

378
00:28:57,198 --> 00:29:01,363
George and his extended jungle
family took off on their first trip.

379
00:29:01,454 --> 00:29:02,913
Look. Look.

380
00:29:04,416 --> 00:29:06,789
Las Vegas!

381
00:29:06,877 --> 00:29:09,204
Anxious to speak to his brethren,
Ape,

382
00:29:09,298 --> 00:29:12,749
but not wanting to stand out
like a simian from the sticks,

383
00:29:12,843 --> 00:29:14,671
George made a stop.

384
00:29:14,763 --> 00:29:17,681
New George
look pretty good in Armani, too.

385
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:28,019
Farklempt at finally
finding each other again,

386
00:29:28,113 --> 00:29:32,741
George and his brother, Ape,
had a big emotional reunion.

387
00:29:33,453 --> 00:29:35,861
- Hi.
- Hello.

388
00:29:35,956 --> 00:29:38,744
Oh, come on,
you can do better than that.

389
00:29:40,962 --> 00:29:48,130
Oh, George! Please!

390
00:29:48,222 --> 00:29:50,298
Let it off.

391
00:29:50,391 --> 00:29:53,263
George so happy to see brother, Ape.

392
00:29:53,353 --> 00:29:55,430
Me, too. What are you doing here?

393
00:29:55,523 --> 00:29:58,857
George here to help.
Tookie say Ape in trouble.

394
00:29:58,944 --> 00:30:01,103
Broke. Busted. No Benjamins.

395
00:30:01,196 --> 00:30:03,817
Broke? It's all
a big misunderstanding.

396
00:30:03,907 --> 00:30:08,899
I'm perfectly fine. That's... why
I'm giving away all my furniture.

397
00:30:08,993 --> 00:30:14,993
George happy Ape perfectly fine.
Only wish George perfectly fine.

398
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:16,193
What's the matter?

399
00:30:16,288 --> 00:30:21,872
Ursula and animals think George
spend too much time with other.

400
00:30:21,958 --> 00:30:25,491
George so upset,
think about taking off neck crown.

401
00:30:25,585 --> 00:30:29,284
Look, I understand your concern.
And if I return...

402
00:30:29,379 --> 00:30:33,671
When I return, I'll coordinate your
schedule to everyone's satisfaction.

403
00:30:33,756 --> 00:30:37,918
- It's just a question of balance.
- George good at balance.

404
00:30:39,927 --> 00:30:41,753
George worried about Ursula.

405
00:30:41,845 --> 00:30:46,386
She's lonely and she worried
she not cook or clean as well as Ape.

406
00:30:46,473 --> 00:30:48,962
Well, she might have a point there.

407
00:30:49,057 --> 00:30:53,764
George worried she miss civilisation
more than she miss George.

408
00:30:54,476 --> 00:30:57,595
Don't be ridiculous!
Ursula adores you.

409
00:30:57,687 --> 00:31:00,770
She's probably just suffering
from the five-year itch.

410
00:31:00,855 --> 00:31:03,809
- What George do?
- What any husband would do.

411
00:31:03,899 --> 00:31:07,267
Get her a nice present
to help scratch it.

412
00:31:09,069 --> 00:31:11,144
A... backscratcher.

413
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:14,145
To help with itch.

414
00:31:14,238 --> 00:31:18,020
As the jungle king demonstrated
the many uses of his gift,

415
00:31:18,115 --> 00:31:20,819
his arch animal enemy
was back in the jungle

416
00:31:20,909 --> 00:31:23,694
trying to take over his throne.

417
00:31:23,785 --> 00:31:26,453
George of the Jungle
has deserted you.

418
00:31:26,537 --> 00:31:28,612
If you elect me your king,

419
00:31:28,705 --> 00:31:34,823
I promise to make every Tuesday
"Meatless Tuesday."

420
00:31:34,916 --> 00:31:40,075
- But if you don't make me king...
- Oh, I'm scared!

421
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:45,328
...you have no idea
what a mean lion I can really be.

422
00:31:45,422 --> 00:31:48,292
As the Mean Lion
schemed against him,

423
00:31:48,383 --> 00:31:50,706
his perfidious plotters in Las Vegas

424
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:54,713
put the finishing touches
on their perspicacious plan.

425
00:31:56,096 --> 00:31:58,170
Better turn off the alarm.

426
00:32:01,557 --> 00:32:04,640
The old witch says he keeps the deed
in his underwear.

427
00:32:04,725 --> 00:32:08,638
- That's disgusting.
- At least it'll be easy to find.

428
00:32:17,316 --> 00:32:19,805
These look familiar.

429
00:32:21,484 --> 00:32:24,853
Obviously he was planning
to stay for a while.

430
00:32:26,238 --> 00:32:31,312
You would think at some point, Ursula
would recommend a zebra pattern.

431
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:36,316
Unaware of the deadly denizens
determined to destroy him...

432
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:38,449
Well, that's a change of pace.

433
00:32:38,537 --> 00:32:43,741
...our accidental tourist took his
family backstage at Circus Circus.

434
00:32:45,624 --> 00:32:49,038
As George gleefully greeted
his performing pals...

435
00:32:50,043 --> 00:32:53,742
...Ursula wondered
if she'd ever come first.

436
00:32:59,548 --> 00:33:03,461
George, this is Rocky.
He's very honoured to meet you.

437
00:33:03,551 --> 00:33:05,210
Why do they call him Rocky?

438
00:33:06,052 --> 00:33:08,756
Because when he gets nervous,
he does that.

439
00:33:09,887 --> 00:33:13,717
George... honoured...
to... meet... Rocky... too.

440
00:33:17,725 --> 00:33:21,258
He says he was born in a cage,
but he wants to return home with you

441
00:33:21,352 --> 00:33:24,554
and learn to become
a real jungle kangaroo.

442
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:27,472
Cage is not good for animals.

443
00:33:27,564 --> 00:33:30,019
George, kangaroos live in Australia,

444
00:33:30,107 --> 00:33:32,775
we can't bring Rocky
back to the Bukuvu.

445
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:36,102
Tell him we're really sorry.

446
00:33:39,821 --> 00:33:43,354
Don't worry, George,
he won't bother you again.

447
00:33:43,949 --> 00:33:49,071
While our simple simian was being
stalked by a star-struck kangaroo,

448
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:53,108
Lyle and the women were still
searching our simple simian's shorts.

449
00:33:53,204 --> 00:33:56,488
What now? It'll take us years
to go through the rest of these.

450
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:58,122
And it would have, too,

451
00:33:58,206 --> 00:34:02,416
had the precise, practical, pragmatic
Ursula not labelled them.

452
00:34:02,501 --> 00:34:04,576
Oo-oo feathers.

453
00:34:07,878 --> 00:34:09,954
Hyena burger.

454
00:34:12,381 --> 00:34:15,914
Wait a second. Deed.

455
00:34:16,008 --> 00:34:20,752
Lyle immediately dispatched
a dastardly disciple to the jungle,

456
00:34:20,845 --> 00:34:23,334
who enjoyed evicting the animals.

457
00:34:29,641 --> 00:34:35,060
In every other story the king
of the jungle is a lion not a human.

458
00:34:35,144 --> 00:34:37,634
And so, as is my birthright,

459
00:34:37,729 --> 00:34:42,270
I now declare myself
king of the jungle!

460
00:34:42,356 --> 00:34:45,689
- This is really bad!
- Tuesdays are still meatless, right?

461
00:34:45,776 --> 00:34:47,898
You can't be king without the amulet.

462
00:34:47,985 --> 00:34:51,068
Then I'll just have to get it back,
won't I?

463
00:34:51,154 --> 00:34:53,276
We need George. Where's George?

464
00:34:53,363 --> 00:34:55,770
George's friends were worried.

465
00:34:56,365 --> 00:35:00,526
While Lyle celebrated getting the
deed in a typically mature fashion.

466
00:35:01,326 --> 00:35:02,274
I have the deed

467
00:35:02,368 --> 00:35:03,317
I have the deed

468
00:35:03,411 --> 00:35:05,532
This is the deed I have

469
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:07,695
I have the deed

470
00:35:07,788 --> 00:35:10,076
Getting the deed
is only half the battle.

471
00:35:10,164 --> 00:35:13,532
Lt means nothing unless you get
Ursula to fall in love with you.

472
00:35:13,624 --> 00:35:16,993
- Are you prepared for tonight?
- I'm prepared.

473
00:35:17,084 --> 00:35:18,579
And so was Ape,

474
00:35:18,669 --> 00:35:22,796
because they had all come to see
the swinging songster perform.

475
00:35:22,879 --> 00:35:25,452
Eat!

476
00:35:39,139 --> 00:35:41,427
Now, when I count to three,

477
00:35:41,516 --> 00:35:46,389
you will awaken and feel refreshed,
and remember nothing.

478
00:35:46,476 --> 00:35:49,145
One. Two. Three.

479
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,313
Ice cream?
But I'm lactose intolerant!

480
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:08,605
Oops.

481
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:10,364
Sorry.

482
00:36:10,449 --> 00:36:13,697
Remember, I am Armando,

483
00:36:13,784 --> 00:36:18,325
and I can hypnotise anyone
to do anything! Good night!

484
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:23,782
The Conrad Jupiter's Hotel
and Casino is proud to present

485
00:36:23,873 --> 00:36:30,833
the selected song stylings
of the one and only Ape!

486
00:36:36,505 --> 00:36:38,912
Here he comes

487
00:36:39,007 --> 00:36:41,675
Walking down the street

488
00:36:41,759 --> 00:36:47,840
He gets the funniest looks
from everyone he meets

489
00:36:49,263 --> 00:36:51,468
Hey, hey, I'm a monkey

490
00:36:51,556 --> 00:36:54,341
And people say I monkey around

491
00:36:54,432 --> 00:37:00,302
Well, I'm too busy singing
to put anybody down

492
00:37:00,394 --> 00:37:02,635
I'm just trying to be friendly

493
00:37:02,812 --> 00:37:06,014
Come and watch me sing and play

494
00:37:06,105 --> 00:37:08,678
I'm the young generation

495
00:37:08,774 --> 00:37:12,307
And I've got something to say

496
00:37:12,401 --> 00:37:14,689
Hey, hey I'm the monkey

497
00:37:14,778 --> 00:37:18,109
Hey, hey, I'm a monkey

498
00:37:18,196 --> 00:37:20,768
Hey, hey, I'm a monkey

499
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:23,899
Hey, hey I'm the monkey

500
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:26,943
Yeah! Hey! Yeah!

501
00:37:27,034 --> 00:37:30,283
Hey, hey, I'm a monkey

502
00:37:30,369 --> 00:37:34,828
Yeah! Thank you. Thank you.

503
00:37:34,913 --> 00:37:38,696
- Thank you. Girls.
- You were wonderful

504
00:37:40,834 --> 00:37:46,122
Ape will be back in a few minutes
with his tribute to Tony Orlando.

505
00:37:49,755 --> 00:37:52,245
It's from the gentleman over there.

506
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:53,999
Lyle.

507
00:37:57,468 --> 00:38:00,088
Beatrice, you're looking lovely.

508
00:38:00,178 --> 00:38:03,048
Ursula, what a small world.

509
00:38:03,138 --> 00:38:05,806
You remember my son-in-law, George.

510
00:38:05,889 --> 00:38:07,798
I do. George.

511
00:38:07,891 --> 00:38:11,969
Clearly the best man won.
But no hard feelings. Shake.

512
00:38:16,688 --> 00:38:18,395
What are you doing here?

513
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,097
Last time we saw you,
you tried to have George killed,

514
00:38:22,191 --> 00:38:24,810
Ape captured,
and dragged me off to marry you.

515
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:28,896
That actually wasn't me, kitten,
that was the altitude sickness.

516
00:38:28,986 --> 00:38:32,685
Lt just so happens,
I have my doctor here, Dr Kerner.

517
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:35,733
In my opinion Lyle was not
responsible for his actions

518
00:38:35,824 --> 00:38:38,776
due to the lack of oxygen
in the Bukuvu Mountains.

519
00:38:38,867 --> 00:38:41,535
You knew I was gonna be here?

520
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:44,108
You're fired.

521
00:38:45,663 --> 00:38:48,697
I didn't know
that you were gonna be here.

522
00:38:49,498 --> 00:38:51,952
I ran into the Lords of Oompah

523
00:38:52,041 --> 00:38:56,286
practising your favourite song,
I Wanna Know What Love Is.

524
00:38:57,752 --> 00:38:59,163
What's that?

525
00:39:09,718 --> 00:39:13,251
Wait a minute.
That not Ursula's favourite song.

526
00:39:14,012 --> 00:39:15,636
This Ursula's favourite song.

527
00:39:15,721 --> 00:39:17,298
One banana, two banana.

528
00:39:26,644 --> 00:39:28,849
No!

529
00:39:28,937 --> 00:39:31,771
- We're dead meat.
- I thought I was making progress.

530
00:39:31,856 --> 00:39:34,724
That ape has a better chance with her
than you do.

531
00:39:34,815 --> 00:39:36,439
He does? What have you heard?

532
00:39:36,524 --> 00:39:39,441
It's time
we brought in some reinforcements.

533
00:39:49,115 --> 00:39:52,364
- Here's your towels, Angels.
- Thanks, Charlie.

534
00:39:53,617 --> 00:39:56,238
- Hey, don't hog the Choco-Blast.
- Mmm.

535
00:39:56,328 --> 00:39:59,742
I'll give you it if Courtney
gives up the Funky Monkey.

536
00:39:59,829 --> 00:40:02,580
Haven't you seen
enough funky monkeys?

537
00:40:04,875 --> 00:40:08,158
- I've missed you guys.
- And we've missed you.

538
00:40:08,251 --> 00:40:13,409
Speaking of things you've missed,
Lyle's looking amazing.

539
00:40:13,504 --> 00:40:16,290
You're right. He's such a catch.

540
00:40:16,381 --> 00:40:20,211
He's charming, rich, sensitive.

541
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:24,509
And is equally at home
with small animals and children.

542
00:40:24,593 --> 00:40:26,466
Are you reading that?

543
00:40:30,555 --> 00:40:34,302
I can't believe my mother flew you
here just to tell me about Lyle.

544
00:40:34,391 --> 00:40:38,434
Your mother didn't send us here.
We're worried about you.

545
00:40:38,518 --> 00:40:41,554
Yeah, I mean, a fling
any of us could understand.

546
00:40:41,645 --> 00:40:44,182
And would gladly
have traded places with you.

547
00:40:44,271 --> 00:40:47,141
Yeah.

548
00:40:47,232 --> 00:40:52,853
- We're concerned you'll change.
- Come on. I haven't changed a bit.

549
00:41:28,213 --> 00:41:32,957
I can't believe I just did that.
I guess I have changed.

550
00:41:36,635 --> 00:41:40,678
You belong here. Your whole identity
will get swallowed up by George,

551
00:41:40,762 --> 00:41:43,465
and the Ursula we know and love
will disappear.

552
00:41:43,555 --> 00:41:48,595
You deserve a husband who'd rather
spend time with you than a gorilla.

553
00:41:48,684 --> 00:41:50,426
But I love George.

554
00:41:50,518 --> 00:41:54,348
Doesn't mean he's right for you.
You and Lyle have more in common.

555
00:41:54,437 --> 00:41:58,267
She's right. You should be with
someone who's refined, polished,

556
00:41:58,356 --> 00:42:00,845
someone who cares
about your feelings.

557
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:04,273
George doesn't know
how to make you happy.

558
00:42:06,068 --> 00:42:11,273
Look, what's this great present
he gets you? A backscratcher.

559
00:42:14,489 --> 00:42:18,320
And where did he take you on
your first day back in civilisation?

560
00:42:18,408 --> 00:42:21,029
Backstage at Circus Circus.

561
00:42:22,202 --> 00:42:24,871
Can you believe his lack of feeling?

562
00:42:24,954 --> 00:42:27,658
You've been isolated
from all your friends,

563
00:42:27,748 --> 00:42:34,281
hungry for human companionship,
and he brings you to an animal show.

564
00:42:34,376 --> 00:42:36,451
How selfish.

565
00:42:36,544 --> 00:42:40,670
This man doesn't love you, darling,
he hardly knows you.

566
00:42:40,755 --> 00:42:43,956
It'll be so wonderful
when you're finally home.

567
00:42:44,048 --> 00:42:46,585
The opera opens next month.

568
00:42:46,675 --> 00:42:50,505
And we can go to the Canyon Ranch
to have some kind of total makeover.

569
00:42:50,594 --> 00:42:55,799
And there's that wonderful charity
cruise for some kind of poor people.

570
00:42:55,888 --> 00:42:57,964
Oh, yeah.

571
00:43:00,849 --> 00:43:03,635
- Wait a second.
- What?

572
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:10,807
I... am the luckiest woman
in the whole world.

573
00:43:11,773 --> 00:43:14,641
So he isn't
the greatest retail shopper.

574
00:43:14,732 --> 00:43:17,768
I have a man I love
and a child I adore,

575
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:21,642
and he gives me
what all of you pray for.

576
00:43:28,448 --> 00:43:30,773
I want my George.

577
00:43:41,372 --> 00:43:43,447
What do we do now?

578
00:43:43,874 --> 00:43:45,782
I don't know.

579
00:43:45,875 --> 00:43:48,911
Oh, look to your left.

580
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:54,168
I think I have an idea.

581
00:43:54,255 --> 00:43:57,171
Yes,
in a brilliantly desperate attempt

582
00:43:57,256 --> 00:43:59,497
to bring Ursula and Lyle together,

583
00:43:59,591 --> 00:44:02,959
Our masterminding major-domo
mother-in-law

584
00:44:03,051 --> 00:44:09,170
has hired Armando to hypnotise
Ursula into forgetting George.

585
00:44:10,514 --> 00:44:13,882
When you awaken,
the name George of the Jungle

586
00:44:13,975 --> 00:44:17,010
will forever be stricken
from your memory.

587
00:44:17,101 --> 00:44:19,426
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

588
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:23,350
There was a fat lady in a wheelchair
hogging the handicap spot.

589
00:44:23,439 --> 00:44:25,726
His face will be blank.

590
00:44:25,814 --> 00:44:28,518
You will not recognise him.

591
00:44:28,608 --> 00:44:31,691
He will mean
absolutely nothing to you.

592
00:44:35,737 --> 00:44:39,899
Oh, yes. Ursula, your husband
is Lyle Van de Groot.

593
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,991
One. Two. Three.

594
00:44:46,619 --> 00:44:48,076
Pumpkin!

595
00:44:48,161 --> 00:44:51,077
Lt took two movies
and a crooked hypnotist,

596
00:44:51,162 --> 00:44:55,657
but the lecherous Lyle Van de Groot
had finally gotten his wish.

597
00:44:55,748 --> 00:45:01,167
Ursula was, in a manner of speaking,
his wife.

598
00:45:03,336 --> 00:45:04,996
Hello?

599
00:45:05,713 --> 00:45:07,124
Hello?

600
00:45:07,214 --> 00:45:08,873
Hello?

601
00:45:09,966 --> 00:45:12,801
Turn the phone around, you idiot!

602
00:45:16,096 --> 00:45:18,967
This George,
George looking for Ursula.

603
00:45:19,057 --> 00:45:20,848
Oh, she's here with Junior.

604
00:45:20,934 --> 00:45:24,017
She doesn't love you anymore.
She's left you for Lyle.

605
00:45:24,103 --> 00:45:26,178
Ursula leave George?

606
00:45:26,896 --> 00:45:29,683
Yes. She's with Lyle now.

607
00:45:30,483 --> 00:45:34,610
George want to tell her that George
stop being king if she take him back.

608
00:45:34,694 --> 00:45:40,033
Too late. You should have thought
of that when you had no time for her.

609
00:45:40,115 --> 00:45:43,863
The people she misses are here.
She lives here now.

610
00:45:43,952 --> 00:45:45,576
Face it, George,

611
00:45:45,662 --> 00:45:49,706
your experiment with having a family
has been a failure.

612
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:52,541
You're not fit
to be a husband or a father.

613
00:45:52,626 --> 00:45:56,041
Go back to the animals
where you belong.

614
00:46:27,529 --> 00:46:29,604
Junior.

615
00:47:07,144 --> 00:47:09,219
Goodbye, Ursula.

616
00:47:10,397 --> 00:47:12,472
Junior.

617
00:47:41,046 --> 00:47:43,963
Come on, dear,
we don't wanna miss our flight.

618
00:47:44,048 --> 00:47:46,123
Everything's so foggy.

619
00:47:46,216 --> 00:47:48,458
- Lyle's my husband?
- Yes, darling.

620
00:47:48,552 --> 00:47:50,877
You've been under
a lot of stress lately.

621
00:47:50,970 --> 00:47:54,469
- Hold your father's hand.
- You're not my father!

622
00:47:56,267 --> 00:47:59,018
Not polite kick Daddy!

623
00:47:59,102 --> 00:48:04,475
Having heedlessly hewn our hero's
heavy heart into hittle hieces...

624
00:48:04,565 --> 00:48:06,023
I mean, little pieces,

625
00:48:06,108 --> 00:48:10,271
the vengeful Van de Groot tried to
impress his pilfered princess Ursula

626
00:48:10,362 --> 00:48:13,730
with a dazzling display
of animal magnetism.

627
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:15,446
Come here.

628
00:48:15,532 --> 00:48:18,567
See, honey, horses are my friends.

629
00:48:19,952 --> 00:48:22,739
Kind of.
Maybe "friend" is too strong.

630
00:48:22,829 --> 00:48:25,117
Are you sure Lyle's my husband?

631
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:31,915
See, honey, horses love me.
Come here.

632
00:48:35,214 --> 00:48:39,460
Horses... love... me!

633
00:48:39,551 --> 00:48:41,627
Horses love me!

634
00:48:42,637 --> 00:48:44,926
You guys ready to go for a ride?

635
00:48:45,014 --> 00:48:47,765
How'd you ever let me marry that guy?

636
00:48:47,850 --> 00:48:52,310
While they tried to figure out
why Ursula was married to an idiot,

637
00:48:52,394 --> 00:48:56,557
Lyle's bulldozers were arriving to
clear the animals out of the Bukuvu.

638
00:49:11,118 --> 00:49:15,614
Locked up by the Mean Lion to keep
him from contacting his former king,

639
00:49:15,705 --> 00:49:19,619
the tactile Tookie-Tookie
had been plotting his escape.

640
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:54,476
George can't live without Ursula,
so George going to get her back.

641
00:49:56,529 --> 00:49:58,189
Tookie!

642
00:49:59,448 --> 00:50:02,448
Mean Lion crown himself king?
Animals kicked off land?

643
00:50:02,534 --> 00:50:05,618
Need George to save animals?!
Have two days?! Ape!

644
00:50:05,704 --> 00:50:07,114
We have to go right away.

645
00:50:07,205 --> 00:50:10,988
I should've told you earlier,
but I have some gambling debts

646
00:50:11,083 --> 00:50:13,490
that I have to work off
for a little while.

647
00:50:13,585 --> 00:50:16,501
- How little?
- 17 years.

648
00:50:16,587 --> 00:50:19,422
George think maybe
that might be too late.

649
00:50:19,507 --> 00:50:23,005
When we get home, Ape can take out
loan from Bukuvu Credit Union.

650
00:50:23,093 --> 00:50:26,010
George, these aren't nice people.

651
00:50:26,095 --> 00:50:28,134
George won't go without Ape.

652
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:32,677
Future of jungle
and George depends on it.

653
00:50:41,982 --> 00:50:44,189
- Alright, George.
- Yeah!

654
00:50:45,527 --> 00:50:46,808
Yes. Yes.

655
00:50:47,945 --> 00:50:52,239
Must get wife and son, who don't
want me, and amulet to lead troops.

656
00:50:52,324 --> 00:50:57,235
Then the question is, how to get
the two of us up to San Francisco?

657
00:50:58,913 --> 00:51:00,621
Better make that three of us.

658
00:51:09,087 --> 00:51:12,586
Come on! Come on!
Jungle boogie. Go, go, go!

659
00:51:15,718 --> 00:51:17,295
Going somewhere?

660
00:51:17,386 --> 00:51:19,876
Who are you, Xena,
Princess of Vegas?

661
00:51:19,971 --> 00:51:23,754
We'll see how funny you are
in a cage at the Van de Groot Zoo.

662
00:51:23,849 --> 00:51:28,427
In case you've forgotten, you still
owe us 17 years of employment.

663
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:30,595
- Get moving.
- Run!

664
00:51:32,982 --> 00:51:34,440
Rocky, get hopping.

665
00:51:36,527 --> 00:51:38,898
Come on. Let's get 'em.

666
00:51:52,498 --> 00:51:54,785
- Excuse me.
- George sorry.

667
00:52:04,216 --> 00:52:07,169
Thank you. Excuse me.

668
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:10,959
- Outta the way!
- Move!

669
00:52:17,184 --> 00:52:18,559
Nice.

670
00:52:19,269 --> 00:52:20,977
Look out!

671
00:52:27,067 --> 00:52:29,142
Quick, George!

672
00:52:30,152 --> 00:52:32,441
Outta the way. Let's go.

673
00:52:34,114 --> 00:52:36,189
Watch out, George!

674
00:52:37,825 --> 00:52:39,901
Yeah, that way.

675
00:52:41,245 --> 00:52:43,320
I'll get backup!

676
00:52:47,792 --> 00:52:49,749
Quick!

677
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:01,837
Watch out for that...!

678
00:53:14,314 --> 00:53:16,222
Hey, you! Stop!

679
00:53:16,315 --> 00:53:19,849
Call the police! And Animal Control!

680
00:53:30,618 --> 00:53:33,452
- What now, Ape?
- Oh, dear.

681
00:53:42,627 --> 00:53:45,664
Back away
from the edge of the building.

682
00:53:48,841 --> 00:53:51,331
- Come on, guys. Up here.
- There they are.

683
00:53:51,426 --> 00:53:53,465
Don't move.

684
00:53:56,763 --> 00:53:58,092
You're surrounded.

685
00:53:58,182 --> 00:54:00,802
You have no choice but to surrender.

686
00:54:00,892 --> 00:54:03,430
We'll send a man down
to cut off any escape.

687
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:06,970
I'm sorry, old chum,
we did everything we could.

688
00:54:15,529 --> 00:54:19,573
George have idea.
Just do like George!

689
00:54:24,577 --> 00:54:27,532
Ape! Jump! Come on! Go!

690
00:54:27,622 --> 00:54:31,037
George, I've been away
from the jungle a very long time!

691
00:54:31,125 --> 00:54:33,200
George catch you!

692
00:54:35,294 --> 00:54:37,086
Don't make any sudden moves!

693
00:54:37,171 --> 00:54:39,922
Don't you think that's beneath us?

694
00:54:44,135 --> 00:54:45,593
Ape!

695
00:54:49,472 --> 00:54:51,430
Good kick, Rocky!

696
00:54:54,602 --> 00:54:56,760
- Don't do it!
- Here goes!

697
00:55:01,691 --> 00:55:04,561
- What are they doing?
- Whoo!

698
00:55:04,652 --> 00:55:06,608
Do not swing on the ladder!

699
00:55:06,694 --> 00:55:09,731
We're going to find
a safe place to land.

700
00:55:10,281 --> 00:55:13,863
Do not swing.
You're destabilising the helicopter.

701
00:55:13,950 --> 00:55:15,445
We gotta land.

702
00:55:27,170 --> 00:55:28,961
Oh, this is lovely.

703
00:55:33,675 --> 00:55:36,344
This best swing George ever had!

704
00:55:36,427 --> 00:55:40,507
Because George and his jungle
buddy are swinging together?

705
00:55:40,597 --> 00:55:44,215
No, because not possible
for George to hit...

706
00:55:44,309 --> 00:55:48,306
Yes fans, we've also included
the Empire State Building.

707
00:55:48,394 --> 00:55:50,968
At least the Las Vegas version.

708
00:55:51,064 --> 00:55:52,688
Watch out for that...!

709
00:55:55,234 --> 00:55:58,981
You didn't think
we were gonna pass up this parody.

710
00:55:59,529 --> 00:56:04,819
George! Come on!
You can do it! Come on!

711
00:56:04,908 --> 00:56:06,947
Reach!

712
00:56:07,035 --> 00:56:09,193
Now! Again! Swing over!

713
00:56:09,287 --> 00:56:13,414
Thanks for joining us. In a bizarre
case of life imitating art,

714
00:56:13,498 --> 00:56:15,407
tonight's drama over Las Vegas

715
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:18,951
has reached the very heights
of the Empire State Building.

716
00:56:19,045 --> 00:56:20,669
Our correspondent...

717
00:56:24,841 --> 00:56:28,174
Something about that ape
feels really familiar.

718
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:30,052
It's King Kong.

719
00:56:30,137 --> 00:56:32,592
I thought King Kong
was in black and white.

720
00:56:32,681 --> 00:56:36,298
Would you believe Hollywood?
They colourised it.

721
00:56:42,438 --> 00:56:46,020
Reach! Reach! Grab me! Come on!

722
00:56:46,108 --> 00:56:47,934
Got you! Pull!

723
00:56:48,026 --> 00:56:51,560
Units are arriving on the scene
to get you down.

724
00:56:52,238 --> 00:56:55,273
- So got any other ideas?
- Follow George.

725
00:56:57,117 --> 00:56:58,280
Brilliant.

726
00:56:58,367 --> 00:57:03,159
Meanwhile, that dastardly duo
of damsels, Sally and Kowalski,

727
00:57:03,247 --> 00:57:06,200
were searching
every nook and cranny.

728
00:57:06,291 --> 00:57:08,863
That's cranny, not granny!

729
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:13,543
As halfway around the world,

730
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:17,579
an advancing army
prepared to invade the Bukuvu.

731
00:57:18,759 --> 00:57:22,709
And in San Francisco, Ursula
pondered her present predicament.

732
00:57:23,763 --> 00:57:27,214
I always had the fantasy
that when I kissed the man I love,

733
00:57:27,307 --> 00:57:29,300
I'd hear church bells ringing.

734
00:57:29,393 --> 00:57:31,717
Church bells ringing?

735
00:57:31,811 --> 00:57:33,887
And fireworks.

736
00:57:34,605 --> 00:57:36,313
Fireworks.

737
00:57:36,399 --> 00:57:38,687
Loud, spectacular,

738
00:57:38,775 --> 00:57:43,104
take-your-breath-away,
Fourth of July fireworks.

739
00:57:44,321 --> 00:57:46,397
With Lyle, there's just...

740
00:57:49,826 --> 00:57:51,485
...Lyle.

741
00:57:52,203 --> 00:57:54,278
Yeah.

742
00:57:56,164 --> 00:57:58,571
So much for fantasy.

743
00:58:00,293 --> 00:58:03,827
I can't help feeling
that something's missing.

744
00:58:03,921 --> 00:58:08,000
That somewhere out there,
something's waiting for me.

745
00:58:11,635 --> 00:58:14,339
Sorry to surprise Ursula.

746
00:58:15,596 --> 00:58:17,719
George can't live without Ursula.

747
00:58:19,641 --> 00:58:21,717
George madly in love.

748
00:58:23,060 --> 00:58:31,767
Look... I don't know who you are,
but I'm married... unfortunately.

749
00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:33,519
Right.

750
00:58:34,028 --> 00:58:36,104
George Ursula's husband.

751
00:58:42,368 --> 00:58:45,037
Ursula more confused than George.

752
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:48,702
But no time to talk.
Bukuvu in trouble. Must get back.

753
00:58:48,790 --> 00:58:51,825
George put Ursula first then jungle.

754
00:58:55,003 --> 00:58:59,498
Listen. I've never heard
of the Bukuvu and Lyle's my husband.

755
00:58:59,590 --> 00:59:02,840
Though I have to admit,
you are quite attractive.

756
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:08,127
And have the sinewy arms of a god!

757
00:59:09,723 --> 00:59:14,301
But I'm old-fashioned and take
my marriage vows very seriously.

758
00:59:14,394 --> 00:59:16,350
Then can I have him?

759
00:59:16,437 --> 00:59:20,979
Sorry, George love Ursula
more than anything in the world.

760
00:59:21,066 --> 00:59:23,188
Ursula mean everything to George.

761
00:59:25,485 --> 00:59:29,779
- Do you have any brothers at home?
- I have brother Ape.

762
00:59:29,864 --> 00:59:32,900
Oooh... an ape.

763
00:59:36,453 --> 00:59:38,576
Can you give him my phone number?

764
00:59:38,663 --> 00:59:41,580
Having deposited his dipsy darling
with Ape,

765
00:59:41,666 --> 00:59:46,540
George nervously swung in to see
if his son still remembered him.

766
00:59:46,961 --> 00:59:48,870
Junior?

767
00:59:48,963 --> 00:59:50,754
Daddy!

768
00:59:52,549 --> 00:59:54,672
I missed you so much.

769
00:59:56,219 --> 00:59:57,926
George realise something.

770
00:59:58,012 --> 01:00:03,136
If Junior want to surf
and not swing it's OK with George,

771
01:00:03,225 --> 01:00:09,096
because George love Junior so much,
nothing else matters.

772
01:00:10,063 --> 01:00:12,139
Come here.

773
01:00:12,315 --> 01:00:14,142
I love you too, Dad.

774
01:00:14,234 --> 01:00:18,646
But I think you better talk to Mom,
because she's been acting strange.

775
01:00:18,738 --> 01:00:20,814
Yeah.

776
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:24,275
Come on!

777
01:00:24,827 --> 01:00:26,903
I'll take the stairs.

778
01:00:28,372 --> 01:00:30,032
OK.

779
01:00:30,874 --> 01:00:34,824
So with his devoted son
and dormant wife,

780
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:37,624
George headed back
to his homeland.

781
01:00:37,922 --> 01:00:42,501
After a tip from Brendan Fraser, who
was cramped during the first picture,

782
01:00:42,594 --> 01:00:45,879
this time he made sure
to get a bigger crate.

783
01:00:46,264 --> 01:00:48,755
- Dad, I'm afraid.
- Hmm.

784
01:00:48,850 --> 01:00:51,008
What are we gonna do about Mom?

785
01:00:54,605 --> 01:00:56,265
George not know.

786
01:00:56,357 --> 01:01:00,271
But Ursula not recognise George
even before George level her.

787
01:01:01,194 --> 01:01:03,271
What Ape think?

788
01:01:03,363 --> 01:01:05,819
Either we should check the crate
for pods,

789
01:01:05,908 --> 01:01:10,949
or she's in some sort of hypnotic
trance. She doesn't know who you are.

790
01:01:24,216 --> 01:01:28,545
Upon arrival, George whistled
for Shep to take them home.

791
01:01:32,766 --> 01:01:34,640
Hey, boy! Over here, boy!

792
01:01:34,727 --> 01:01:37,811
Come on! Come on, Shep!
Come on, Shep!

793
01:01:37,896 --> 01:01:41,230
Come on, boy! Come On!
That's a good boy.

794
01:01:41,316 --> 01:01:43,723
Shep!

795
01:01:45,445 --> 01:01:48,779
See if you can spot
our discreet product placement.

796
01:01:48,865 --> 01:01:51,438
That's my Shep.

797
01:01:52,535 --> 01:01:55,240
The elephant's wearing New Balance.

798
01:02:00,501 --> 01:02:01,829
Go, Shep! Go!

799
01:02:01,919 --> 01:02:03,958
Go, boy! That's it!

800
01:02:05,297 --> 01:02:09,425
I tell you, George,
it's good to be home.

801
01:02:09,510 --> 01:02:12,878
Maybe Tookie wrong
and Mean Lion not king.

802
01:02:12,971 --> 01:02:14,880
Jungle not look different.

803
01:02:14,973 --> 01:02:18,887
- Not different? Look at
the signs, George! The signs!

804
01:02:18,976 --> 01:02:21,135
But George missed the signs.

805
01:02:21,229 --> 01:02:24,479
Signs even an illiterate warthog
would've noticed.

806
01:02:24,566 --> 01:02:27,138
Because there was a big problem.

807
01:02:27,234 --> 01:02:32,360
Lyle's maniacal machinery was
moving ever closer to Ape Mountain.

808
01:02:32,448 --> 01:02:35,402
Meanwhile,
the cowardly constituents scampered,

809
01:02:35,492 --> 01:02:41,364
as our fearless hero ran after them
beseeching them to stand and fight.

810
01:02:42,916 --> 01:02:46,535
Don't run!
If we work together, we can win.

811
01:02:46,628 --> 01:02:48,667
George still king.

812
01:02:48,755 --> 01:02:50,748
I'm the king!

813
01:02:53,218 --> 01:02:55,257
You know you're not the king.

814
01:02:55,344 --> 01:02:58,927
You've had a narcissistic personality
since you were a cub.

815
01:02:59,015 --> 01:03:03,142
And there's no reason that the rest
of us should have to suffer for it.

816
01:03:05,813 --> 01:03:07,770
If you really care about Bukuvu,

817
01:03:07,857 --> 01:03:10,643
then better idea
we have a bone-crushing fight

818
01:03:10,734 --> 01:03:14,150
for kingdom afterwards.

819
01:03:15,114 --> 01:03:18,696
When we still have kingdom.
What Mean Lion think?

820
01:03:18,783 --> 01:03:20,194
Eat fur, Jungle boy!

821
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:27,115
Yes! Get him!

822
01:03:27,375 --> 01:03:31,953
And they would've had their big,
bone-crushing fight for the kingdom

823
01:03:32,046 --> 01:03:35,415
had it not been for the trick
Ape taught him as kids.

824
01:03:35,508 --> 01:03:37,630
The ear, George!

825
01:03:40,971 --> 01:03:42,679
Cool!

826
01:03:42,765 --> 01:03:44,140
There. See.

827
01:03:47,227 --> 01:03:49,718
George wish life always this easy.

828
01:03:50,564 --> 01:03:52,022
Yeah, Dad!

829
01:03:52,106 --> 01:03:56,484
- Well done, George.
- Alright, who's with George?

830
01:03:56,570 --> 01:04:00,353
Why should we follow you? You care
more about your family than us.

831
01:04:00,448 --> 01:04:03,319
Sure George care about family.

832
01:04:03,409 --> 01:04:07,572
Even half of family sleeping
through best part of movie.

833
01:04:08,956 --> 01:04:12,242
But you've always been
George's brothers and sisters.

834
01:04:12,335 --> 01:04:14,125
Don't you remember?

835
01:04:14,211 --> 01:04:16,880
We took first steps together.

836
01:04:16,964 --> 01:04:18,838
And you taught me how to swim.

837
01:04:20,050 --> 01:04:24,213
And you were with me first time
we read Playape Magazine.

838
01:04:25,013 --> 01:04:29,010
So George beg you, not as king,
but as brother,

839
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:31,887
to join him and save homeland.

840
01:04:40,820 --> 01:04:42,895
George...

841
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:44,813
OK?

842
01:04:44,907 --> 01:04:48,525
OK, George try
something completely different.

843
01:04:49,953 --> 01:04:54,283
We few. We happy few.

844
01:04:54,374 --> 01:04:56,865
We band of brothers.

845
01:04:58,169 --> 01:05:02,119
For he today that sheds his fur
with George,

846
01:05:02,215 --> 01:05:04,254
shall be George's brother.

847
01:05:04,342 --> 01:05:09,502
And other animals shall think
themselves cursed they were not here.

848
01:05:11,056 --> 01:05:15,220
And when we get old,
ye will remember with great pride

849
01:05:15,311 --> 01:05:18,098
what feats ye did today.

850
01:05:19,189 --> 01:05:22,475
Land all we have. George king.

851
01:05:22,568 --> 01:05:28,024
And king ask animals to join him
and save homeland!

852
01:05:41,085 --> 01:05:43,208
Then, George fight alone.

853
01:05:44,130 --> 01:05:46,882
Feeling more alone
than Siegfried without Roy,

854
01:05:46,965 --> 01:05:50,500
our dauntless, daring,
defiant jungle gunslinger

855
01:05:50,594 --> 01:05:53,216
went out to save the Bukuvu.

856
01:06:06,777 --> 01:06:08,982
But soon his friends joined him.

857
01:06:09,070 --> 01:06:12,653
Like The Magnificent Seven,
if they hadn't been magnificent,

858
01:06:12,740 --> 01:06:17,283
and had consisted of a dim king, an
elephant who thought he was a dog,

859
01:06:17,369 --> 01:06:20,454
an ape, a bird, a little monkey
and a kangaroo.

860
01:06:20,539 --> 01:06:24,619
They marched, flew and hopped out
to meet the enemy.

861
01:06:26,253 --> 01:06:31,377
And, just between you and me...
it didn't look good.

862
01:06:31,466 --> 01:06:33,542
Guess just us.

863
01:06:37,805 --> 01:06:40,131
But luckily for George,

864
01:06:40,225 --> 01:06:45,100
after a delayed reaction
to his insouciant iambic pentameter,

865
01:06:45,187 --> 01:06:47,476
the jungle's vacillating varmints

866
01:06:47,565 --> 01:06:50,186
joined the fight
with their potent potentate.

867
01:06:50,276 --> 01:06:52,351
For those without a thesaurus...

868
01:06:52,444 --> 01:06:54,770
After a delayed reaction
to his speech,

869
01:06:54,863 --> 01:06:57,984
the other animals joined
the brouhaha with their king.

870
01:07:14,799 --> 01:07:17,966
Imagining the cold steel
of the deleterious 'dozers

871
01:07:18,052 --> 01:07:21,053
separating his upper half
from his lower,

872
01:07:21,138 --> 01:07:24,922
he ordered his troops back
in a slow and orderly retreat.

873
01:07:25,017 --> 01:07:27,094
Let's go!

874
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:48,155
George realised the only way to win
was to fight fire with... coconuts?!

875
01:07:50,750 --> 01:07:54,166
So he called in the heavy artillery.

876
01:08:24,491 --> 01:08:26,150
Yes!

877
01:08:34,625 --> 01:08:35,656
Nice shooting!

878
01:08:48,388 --> 01:08:51,887
Oh, no! Not elephant zug-zug!

879
01:08:56,229 --> 01:08:57,557
Good shot!

880
01:09:09,825 --> 01:09:11,485
Yeah!

881
01:09:38,602 --> 01:09:42,647
With Shep down, George felt
the need to rally his troops.

882
01:09:42,731 --> 01:09:44,439
Don't worry!

883
01:09:44,524 --> 01:09:47,229
George not know meaning
of word defeat!

884
01:09:48,153 --> 01:09:52,814
Not know meaning of most words,
but especially defeat!

885
01:09:52,907 --> 01:09:59,621
And George will stand here just
as long as George's name is... Herb.

886
01:10:00,122 --> 01:10:02,115
But Herb, I mean George,

887
01:10:02,208 --> 01:10:04,830
quickly realised that a deadly 'dozer

888
01:10:04,919 --> 01:10:09,296
was heading to destroy the tree
house and his still dozing wife.

889
01:10:33,363 --> 01:10:37,442
George not hit women, so appreciate
it if women not hit George.

890
01:11:06,018 --> 01:11:08,510
George realise
that to save tree house,

891
01:11:08,604 --> 01:11:13,396
Bukuvu and entire jungle lifestyle,
George now have to hit woman.

892
01:11:13,484 --> 01:11:17,980
But, in name of sportsmanship,
George give woman fighting chance.

893
01:11:19,614 --> 01:11:22,865
Note to George,
rethink sportsmanship.

894
01:11:46,974 --> 01:11:49,928
Having finally defeated
the pugnacious pair,

895
01:11:50,019 --> 01:11:53,637
Indiana George found himself
with an even bigger bugaboo,

896
01:11:53,731 --> 01:11:56,980
how to turn off the bulldozer?

897
01:12:04,032 --> 01:12:06,108
What this do?

898
01:12:15,376 --> 01:12:17,285
Didn't stop.

899
01:12:17,378 --> 01:12:18,706
Tree house. Not good.

900
01:12:24,134 --> 01:12:25,545
Move, animals!

901
01:12:32,058 --> 01:12:34,016
Junior?!

902
01:12:40,108 --> 01:12:41,816
George son swung!

903
01:12:41,901 --> 01:12:45,020
We did it, Dad. We saved the jungle.

904
01:12:50,910 --> 01:12:52,569
Yeah!

905
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:02,249
Can we join your little celebration?

906
01:13:02,337 --> 01:13:05,751
Yes, it was Ursula's
meddling, mendacious, mock mate,

907
01:13:05,839 --> 01:13:09,503
who, along with Beatrice,
had tracked her back to the Bukuvu.

908
01:13:09,592 --> 01:13:11,383
Mom?

909
01:13:11,468 --> 01:13:13,590
Lyle?

910
01:13:13,678 --> 01:13:15,753
Ursula.

911
01:13:15,846 --> 01:13:18,716
We've come to take my daughter
and grandson home.

912
01:13:20,599 --> 01:13:22,840
You're not my father!

913
01:13:26,185 --> 01:13:29,351
I was expecting that,
that's why I wore shin guards.

914
01:13:33,524 --> 01:13:35,183
Ingrowing toenail!

915
01:13:36,192 --> 01:13:39,145
Now, George,
you may think you've won the war,

916
01:13:39,235 --> 01:13:41,227
but there'll be more bulldozers.

917
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:45,696
You give me back Ursula and Junior
and I'll give you back the deed.

918
01:13:45,781 --> 01:13:48,318
George love Ursula and Junior.

919
01:13:49,992 --> 01:13:53,610
George, I'm sorry, it's no use.

920
01:13:53,703 --> 01:13:58,115
Lyle's my husband,
Junior and I should be with him.

921
01:14:01,750 --> 01:14:05,035
- I'm sorry.
- That's right.

922
01:14:05,128 --> 01:14:07,333
Take it easy, Jungle Head.

923
01:14:09,213 --> 01:14:11,501
- Come along. Let's go.
- No!

924
01:14:12,507 --> 01:14:16,041
Don't let Lyle take me, Dad.
I wanna stay with you.

925
01:14:19,887 --> 01:14:21,962
Alright. OK!

926
01:14:22,055 --> 01:14:26,632
Tell 'em to back off,
or Mighty Joe Old gets it here.

927
01:14:26,724 --> 01:14:29,475
George appreciate
what gorillas do for George,

928
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:32,844
but George not want anyone
to die for him.

929
01:14:34,312 --> 01:14:36,387
Sound advice, doofus.

930
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:39,765
You've used your head
for more than just cracking coconuts.

931
01:14:39,858 --> 01:14:43,225
Tell 'em to back off. Way off!

932
01:14:48,780 --> 01:14:51,270
I want you to have this.

933
01:14:52,574 --> 01:14:57,365
Somehow, I think it belongs to you
in this world.

934
01:14:57,452 --> 01:15:01,400
Oh, really. Must I be forced
to endure this drivel?

935
01:15:01,496 --> 01:15:04,699
Take Ursula and Junior
and let's get on with it.

936
01:15:04,790 --> 01:15:06,581
No problem. I'll get right on it.

937
01:15:06,666 --> 01:15:08,326
OK.

938
01:15:09,293 --> 01:15:11,996
Thanks for watching my family for me.

939
01:15:14,379 --> 01:15:17,463
What George do?
George love animals and jungle,

940
01:15:17,548 --> 01:15:21,627
but more than anything,
George love Ursula and Junior.

941
01:15:24,052 --> 01:15:27,716
So what are you waiting for?
Get after them!

942
01:15:27,804 --> 01:15:29,713
Go on!

943
01:15:31,890 --> 01:15:33,135
Hey!

944
01:15:33,808 --> 01:15:36,215
Classic moment of Western movie,

945
01:15:36,310 --> 01:15:41,136
where hero holds bad guy up in air,
then humiliates with tree wedgie.

946
01:15:42,981 --> 01:15:44,854
George!

947
01:15:45,983 --> 01:15:49,564
George! Un-wedgie me.

948
01:16:27,593 --> 01:16:29,549
That was so nice.

949
01:16:29,635 --> 01:16:31,960
George.

950
01:16:34,097 --> 01:16:35,507
Ursula know George?

951
01:16:35,597 --> 01:16:39,511
Well, of course. You're my husband.

952
01:16:41,435 --> 01:16:43,059
She know George!

953
01:16:43,144 --> 01:16:48,728
As it turned out a kiss from George
was stronger than any hypnotic spell.

954
01:16:48,814 --> 01:16:51,684
Hard to resist kiss from George.

955
01:17:10,495 --> 01:17:13,447
Would you take your hands
off of my wife, please,

956
01:17:13,538 --> 01:17:16,159
whom you have unhypnotised.

957
01:17:16,248 --> 01:17:19,118
I haven't been this disappointed
since sixth grade

958
01:17:19,209 --> 01:17:21,994
when my sister stole
my Shaun Cassidy lunch box.

959
01:17:22,085 --> 01:17:24,457
George confused.

960
01:17:24,545 --> 01:17:28,541
Shaun Cassidy was a popular
TV character in the late '70s

961
01:17:28,631 --> 01:17:30,423
along with Parker Stevenson.

962
01:17:30,508 --> 01:17:32,749
I followed both their careers.

963
01:17:32,843 --> 01:17:34,965
Not confused about Shaun Cassidy.

964
01:17:35,053 --> 01:17:37,921
George confused about
unhypnotising.

965
01:17:38,012 --> 01:17:40,681
Would you like me to explain?

966
01:17:40,764 --> 01:17:42,044
Sure.

967
01:17:42,140 --> 01:17:43,883
That's what I'm here for.

968
01:17:43,974 --> 01:17:46,429
We've all been wondering about that.

969
01:17:46,517 --> 01:17:49,221
Let's not start in, OK?

970
01:17:49,311 --> 01:17:51,932
I speak for everyone
including the audience

971
01:17:52,021 --> 01:17:57,310
when I say this constant stream
of annoying alliteration is annoying!

972
01:17:57,399 --> 01:17:59,557
What are you gonna do about that?

973
01:18:06,655 --> 01:18:08,731
Come on! That hurts!

974
01:18:08,823 --> 01:18:09,986
Wait!

975
01:18:13,326 --> 01:18:16,576
Anyone else
have any critiques or comments?

976
01:18:18,163 --> 01:18:19,325
Good.

977
01:18:19,413 --> 01:18:23,824
But before we can end our movie with
the traditional jungle wedding scene,

978
01:18:23,916 --> 01:18:26,620
George still had
one more official duty.

979
01:18:26,710 --> 01:18:27,741
George!

980
01:18:27,836 --> 01:18:32,247
Helping Ursula bring her friends
out of their hypnotic trance.

981
01:18:35,340 --> 01:18:36,585
George!

982
01:18:48,056 --> 01:18:50,807
But I still don't recognise him!
Stan?

983
01:18:50,892 --> 01:18:52,303
Stan?

984
01:18:52,893 --> 01:18:55,810
Stan? Is that you? Stan?

985
01:18:59,063 --> 01:19:01,767
- Hello.
- And you're a big hairy ape.

986
01:19:01,857 --> 01:19:03,138
Yes!

987
01:19:07,236 --> 01:19:12,228
So domestic bliss has once again
returned to the Bukuvu.

988
01:19:12,906 --> 01:19:15,194
And with Beatrice's full blessing,

989
01:19:15,282 --> 01:19:19,777
George and Ursula
decided to renew their vows.

990
01:19:32,627 --> 01:19:38,248
George want everyone to know,
George no longer available all hours.

991
01:19:38,339 --> 01:19:41,588
From nine to five,
George belong to animals.

992
01:19:46,094 --> 01:19:49,876
From five to nine,
George belong to Junior.

993
01:19:53,182 --> 01:19:57,012
But at all times,
George belong to Ursula.

994
01:19:58,352 --> 01:20:01,055
And Ursula will wear neck crown.

995
01:20:02,688 --> 01:20:08,724
Because without his queen, George
could not be king, or anything else.

996
01:20:18,448 --> 01:20:20,523
Jolly good.

997
01:20:20,616 --> 01:20:22,572
So all's well that ends well

998
01:20:22,659 --> 01:20:26,073
for that defender of the innocent,
protector of the weak,

999
01:20:26,161 --> 01:20:29,777
and all around good guy,
George of the Jungle.

1000
01:20:29,871 --> 01:20:33,204
And now that George
has learned to balance his time,

1001
01:20:33,291 --> 01:20:36,574
he has vowed
never to be late for lunch again.

1002
01:20:36,667 --> 01:20:38,410
Lunchtime!

1003
01:20:49,301 --> 01:20:50,878
Coming through!

1004
01:21:11,981 --> 01:21:12,847
Go, Dad!

1005
01:21:24,906 --> 01:21:27,859
Hi, Mom. Watch this!

1006
01:21:32,953 --> 01:21:37,697
That's my boy!
Jungle surfing not so hard.

1007
01:21:37,790 --> 01:21:39,746
George, watch out for that...

1008
01:21:48,672 --> 01:21:50,580
George, George,
George of the Jungle

1009
01:21:50,673 --> 01:21:52,914
George, George,
George of the Jungle

1010
01:21:53,008 --> 01:21:55,214
George, George,
George of the Jungle

1011
01:21:55,301 --> 01:21:57,708
George, George,
George of the Jungle

1012
01:21:57,803 --> 01:21:59,711
George, George,
George of the Jungle

1013
01:21:59,804 --> 01:22:02,010
George, George,
George of the Jungle

1014
01:22:02,097 --> 01:22:04,089
George, George,
George of the Jungle

1015
01:22:04,182 --> 01:22:06,304
Strong as he can be

1016
01:22:08,934 --> 01:22:10,309
27R, take one.

1017
01:22:14,271 --> 01:22:15,302
OK.

1018
01:22:17,357 --> 01:22:19,147
27R, take 41.

1019
01:22:19,233 --> 01:22:21,557
Thanks, sweetie. Here's the one.

1020
01:22:23,944 --> 01:22:26,564
27R, take 222!

1021
01:22:28,405 --> 01:22:29,603
Cut!

1022
01:22:29,698 --> 01:22:31,357
Watch out for that tree

1023
01:22:31,448 --> 01:22:33,903
George, George,
George of the Jungle

1024
01:22:33,992 --> 01:22:36,031
Lives a life that's free

1025
01:22:38,537 --> 01:22:40,445
Watch out for that tree

1026
01:22:43,373 --> 01:22:45,164
Look out!

1027
01:22:45,249 --> 01:22:47,621
Are you OK, Shep?

1028
01:22:47,709 --> 01:22:48,787
When he gets in a scrape

1029
01:22:48,876 --> 01:22:53,039
He makes his escape with help
from his friend an ape named Ape

1030
01:22:53,129 --> 01:22:55,286
And his elephant Shep
can fetch a log

1031
01:22:55,380 --> 01:22:58,049
He's man's best friend
is George's dog

1032
01:23:02,260 --> 01:23:04,797
What the...?!

1033
01:23:04,887 --> 01:23:07,721
He's George, George,
George of the Jungle

1034
01:23:07,805 --> 01:23:09,631
Strong as he can be

1035
01:23:21,064 --> 01:23:23,388
Watch out for that tree

1036
01:23:23,482 --> 01:23:25,355
George, George,
George of the Jungle

1037
01:23:25,442 --> 01:23:27,433
Friend to you and me

1038
01:23:29,903 --> 01:23:31,479
Oh, dear. Sorry.

1039
01:23:33,822 --> 01:23:36,063
Watch out for that tree

1040
01:23:36,157 --> 01:23:38,065
Hear him holler, swing and sing

1041
01:23:38,158 --> 01:23:40,992
All the animals come
to the jungle king

1042
01:23:41,077 --> 01:23:43,531
So grab a vine and swing in time

1043
01:23:43,620 --> 01:23:46,370
If you strike a tree
just pay no mind

1044
01:23:46,454 --> 01:23:49,371
Like George, George,
George of the Jungle

1045
01:23:49,457 --> 01:23:51,698
George, George,
George of the Jungle

1046
01:23:51,792 --> 01:23:53,783
George, George,
George of the Jungle

1047
01:23:53,876 --> 01:23:57,160
George, George,
George of the Jungle

1048
01:23:57,253 --> 01:23:59,328
George of the Jungle

1049
01:24:11,679 --> 01:24:13,920
George, George,
George of the Jungle

1050
01:24:14,014 --> 01:24:16,089
George, George,
George of the Jungle

1051
01:24:16,182 --> 01:24:18,257
George, George,
George of the Jungle

1052
01:24:18,350 --> 01:24:20,472
George, George,
George of the Jungle

1053
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:22,801
George, George,
George of the Jungle

1054
01:24:22,895 --> 01:24:25,266
Strong as he can be

1055
01:24:27,356 --> 01:24:29,680
Watch out for that tree

1056
01:24:29,774 --> 01:24:31,932
George, George,
George of the Jungle

1057
01:24:32,026 --> 01:24:34,017
Lives a life that's free

1058
01:24:36,362 --> 01:24:38,235
Watch out for that tree

1059
01:24:38,321 --> 01:24:39,435
When he gets in a scrape

1060
01:24:39,530 --> 01:24:43,941
He makes his escape with help
from his friend an ape named Ape

1061
01:24:44,033 --> 01:24:46,190
And his elephant Shep
can fetch a log

1062
01:24:46,284 --> 01:24:48,953
He's man's best friend
is George's dog

1063
01:24:49,036 --> 01:24:51,871
He's George, George,
George of the Jungle

1064
01:24:51,955 --> 01:24:54,030
Strong as he can be

1065
01:24:56,583 --> 01:24:58,741
Watch out for that tree

1066
01:24:58,835 --> 01:25:00,910
George, George,
George of the Jungle

1067
01:25:01,003 --> 01:25:03,125
Friend to you and me

1068
01:25:05,505 --> 01:25:07,711
Watch out for that tree

1069
01:25:07,798 --> 01:25:09,707
Hear him holler, swing and sing

1070
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:13,048
All the animals come
to the jungle king

1071
01:25:13,135 --> 01:25:15,292
So grab a vine and swing in time

1072
01:25:15,386 --> 01:25:18,339
If you strike a tree
just pay no mind

1073
01:25:18,430 --> 01:25:21,050
Like George, George,
George of the Jungle

1074
01:25:21,139 --> 01:25:23,427
George, George,
George of the Jungle

1075
01:25:23,516 --> 01:25:25,555
George, George,
George of the Jungle

1076
01:25:25,642 --> 01:25:28,927
George, George,
George of the Jungle

1077
01:25:29,020 --> 01:25:31,095
George of the Jungle

1078
01:25:33,523 --> 01:25:35,598
George of the Jungle

1079
01:25:38,026 --> 01:25:40,101
George of the Jungle

1080
01:25:42,654 --> 01:25:44,729
George of the Jungle

1081
01:25:45,947 --> 01:25:48,069
George, George,
George of the Jungle

1082
01:25:48,157 --> 01:25:50,314
Swing from tree to tree

1083
01:25:52,701 --> 01:25:54,859
Watch out for that tree

1084
01:25:56,121 --> 01:25:58,528
And so that ends the movie.

1085
01:25:58,622 --> 01:26:04,789
And, as always, everyone
winds up happy except for me.

1086
01:26:04,876 --> 01:26:07,201
But who cares about a narrator?

1087
01:26:07,295 --> 01:26:09,998
Well, fine, just leave me alone.

1088
01:26:10,087 --> 01:26:13,752
Go out with your boyfriend or
your girlfriend or your best friend

1089
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:16,508
or your husband or your wife.

1090
01:26:16,591 --> 01:26:18,252
Just go, I said.

1091
01:26:18,343 --> 01:26:23,216
Go on. Nobody cares
about these credits anyway.

1092
01:26:23,304 --> 01:26:26,755
Contractually,
we have to show the credits.

1093
01:26:28,349 --> 01:26:29,463
Who are you?

1094
01:26:29,558 --> 01:26:31,515
I'm the narrator from Mulan.

1095
01:26:31,602 --> 01:26:34,091
Well...

1096
01:26:34,186 --> 01:26:36,060
it's really nice to meet you.

1097
01:26:46,486 --> 01:26:48,561
George, George,
George of the Jungle

1098
01:26:48,654 --> 01:26:50,278
Watch out for that tree
