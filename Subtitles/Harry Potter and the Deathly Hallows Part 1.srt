3
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:41,246
These are dark times,
there is no denying.

4
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:47,492
Our world has, perhaps,
faced no greater threat than it does today.

5
00:00:48,466 --> 00:00:52,425
But I say this to our citizenry:

6
00:00:52,604 --> 00:00:56,506
We, ever your servants...

7
00:00:56,675 --> 00:00:59,337
...will continue to defend your liberty...

8
00:00:59,511 --> 00:01:03,845
...and repel the forces
that seek to take it from you.

9
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:10,317
Your Ministry remains...

10
00:01:10,855 --> 00:01:12,823
...strong.

11
00:01:30,175 --> 00:01:32,370
Hermione. Tea's ready, darling.

12
00:01:32,544 --> 00:01:34,478
Coming, Mom.

13
00:01:38,416 --> 00:01:40,316
Come on, Dudley, hurry up.

14
00:01:40,485 --> 00:01:43,511
I still don't understand
why we have to leave.

15
00:01:43,688 --> 00:01:48,455
Because, unh,
it's not safe for us here anymore.

16
00:02:03,842 --> 00:02:08,211
Ron, tell your father
supper's nearly ready.

17
00:02:13,218 --> 00:02:14,947
Is this in Australia?

18
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,088
Looks wonderful, doesn't it?

19
00:02:17,255 --> 00:02:22,124
<i>Three and a half thousand
kilometers along Australia's east coast.</i>

20
00:02:23,428 --> 00:02:24,952
<i>Obliviate.</i>

21
00:04:39,297 --> 00:04:40,958
Severus.

22
00:04:41,132 --> 00:04:44,499
I was beginning to worry
you had lost your way.

23
00:04:44,669 --> 00:04:48,127
Come, we've saved you a seat.

24
00:04:52,577 --> 00:04:53,908
You bring news, I trust?

25
00:04:54,078 --> 00:04:57,741
It will happen Saturday next, at nightfall.

26
00:04:57,916 --> 00:05:00,282
I've heard differently, my Lord.

27
00:05:00,451 --> 00:05:03,579
Dawlish, the Auror,
has let slip that the Potter boy...

28
00:05:03,755 --> 00:05:06,849
...will not be moved
until the 30th of this month.

29
00:05:07,292 --> 00:05:08,554
The day before he turns 17.

30
00:05:08,726 --> 00:05:11,957
This is a false trail.

31
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:16,794
The Auror Office no longer plays any part
in the protection of Harry Potter.

32
00:05:16,968 --> 00:05:21,337
Those closest to him believe
we have infiltrated the Ministry.

33
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,532
Well, they got that right, haven't they?

34
00:05:28,012 --> 00:05:30,480
What say you, Pius?

35
00:05:34,018 --> 00:05:36,612
One hears many things, my Lord.

36
00:05:36,788 --> 00:05:39,348
Whether the truth is among them
is not clear.

37
00:05:39,524 --> 00:05:42,891
Heh. Spoken like a true politician.

38
00:05:43,061 --> 00:05:46,121
You will, I think,
prove most useful, Pius.

39
00:05:49,734 --> 00:05:52,965
- Where will he be taken, the boy?
- To a safe house.

40
00:05:53,371 --> 00:05:55,999
Most likely the home of someone
in the Order.

41
00:05:56,174 --> 00:05:59,405
I'm told it's been given
every manner of protection possible.

42
00:05:59,577 --> 00:06:03,172
Once there,
it will be impractical to attack him.

43
00:06:03,348 --> 00:06:08,285
Ahem. My Lord.
I'd like to volunteer myself for this task.

44
00:06:08,453 --> 00:06:09,442
I want to kill the boy.

45
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:12,016
Wormtail!

46
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:15,159
Have I not spoken to you
about keeping our guest quiet?

47
00:06:15,326 --> 00:06:17,226
Yes, my Lord.

48
00:06:17,395 --> 00:06:20,057
Right away, my Lord.

49
00:06:20,298 --> 00:06:24,792
As inspiring
as I find your bloodlust, Bellatrix...

50
00:06:25,236 --> 00:06:28,535
...I must be the one to kill Harry Potter.

51
00:06:31,009 --> 00:06:35,810
But I face an unfortunate complication.

52
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:41,179
That my wand and Potter's
share the same core.

53
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:48,984
They are, in some ways, twins.

54
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:53,859
We can wound,
but not fatally harm one another.

55
00:06:55,466 --> 00:06:58,264
If I am to kill him...

56
00:06:58,937 --> 00:07:02,703
...I must do it with another's wand.

57
00:07:04,709 --> 00:07:10,409
Come,
surely one of you would like the honor?

58
00:07:12,016 --> 00:07:13,677
Mm?

59
00:07:15,386 --> 00:07:20,187
What about you, Lucius?

60
00:07:22,694 --> 00:07:24,093
My Lord?

61
00:07:24,262 --> 00:07:26,230
"My Lord?"

62
00:07:27,298 --> 00:07:30,927
I require your wand.

63
00:07:44,248 --> 00:07:46,716
Do I detect elm?

64
00:07:46,884 --> 00:07:48,852
Yes, my Lord.

65
00:07:54,792 --> 00:07:57,727
And the core?

66
00:07:57,895 --> 00:08:00,090
Dragon. Ahem.

67
00:08:00,264 --> 00:08:01,891
Dragon heartstring, my Lord.

68
00:08:02,066 --> 00:08:04,261
- Dragon heartstring.
- Mm.

69
00:08:19,984 --> 00:08:21,747
To those of you who do not know...

70
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,581
...we are joined tonight
by Miss Charity Burbage...

71
00:08:24,756 --> 00:08:30,251
...who, until recently, taught at Hogwarts
School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

72
00:08:30,428 --> 00:08:33,886
Her specialty was Muggle Studies.

73
00:08:37,101 --> 00:08:43,370
It is Miss Burbage's belief
that Muggles are not so different from us.

74
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:47,170
She would, given her way...

75
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:49,879
...have us mate with them.

76
00:08:53,551 --> 00:08:59,751
To her, the mixture of magical
and Muggle blood is not an abomination...

77
00:08:59,924 --> 00:09:02,950
...but something to be encouraged.

78
00:09:04,028 --> 00:09:05,893
Severus.

79
00:09:06,064 --> 00:09:08,032
Severus, please.

80
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,861
We're friends.

81
00:09:16,641 --> 00:09:18,199
<i>Avada Kedavra!</i>

82
00:09:28,453 --> 00:09:30,478
Nagini.

83
00:09:34,092 --> 00:09:35,753
Dinner.

84
00:11:21,065 --> 00:11:24,466
- Hello, Harry.
- All right. Wow.

85
00:11:24,635 --> 00:11:25,727
Hello.

86
00:11:25,903 --> 00:11:28,804
- You're looking fit.
- Yeah, he's absolutely gorgeous.

87
00:11:28,973 --> 00:11:31,441
What say we get undercover
before someone murders him?

88
00:11:31,609 --> 00:11:32,633
Evening.

89
00:11:37,548 --> 00:11:39,948
I thought you were
looking after the Prime Minister.

90
00:11:40,117 --> 00:11:42,017
You are more important.

91
00:11:42,186 --> 00:11:45,246
- Hello, Harry. Bill Weasley.
- Oh. Pleasure to meet you.

92
00:11:45,423 --> 00:11:48,415
- He was never always this handsome.
- Dead ugly.

93
00:11:48,593 --> 00:11:49,992
True enough.

94
00:11:50,161 --> 00:11:52,686
Owe it all to a werewolf,
name of Greyback.

95
00:11:52,863 --> 00:11:56,230
- Hope to repay the favor one day.
- You're still beautiful to me, William.

96
00:11:56,601 --> 00:12:00,230
Just remember, Fleur,
Bill takes his steaks on the raw side now.

97
00:12:00,404 --> 00:12:02,736
My husband, the joker.

98
00:12:02,907 --> 00:12:06,172
By the way, wait till you hear the news.
Remus and I--

99
00:12:06,344 --> 00:12:08,778
All right. We'll have time
for a cozy catch-up later.

100
00:12:08,946 --> 00:12:11,915
We've got to get the hell out of here.
And soon.

101
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:15,848
Potter, you're underage, which means
you've still got the Trace on you.

102
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,044
What's the Trace?

103
00:12:17,221 --> 00:12:19,883
If you sneeze, the Ministry will know
who wipes your nose.

104
00:12:20,057 --> 00:12:23,220
We have to use those means of transport
the Trace can't detect:

105
00:12:23,394 --> 00:12:25,726
Brooms, Thestrals and the like.
We go in pairs.

106
00:12:25,896 --> 00:12:29,662
That way, if anyone's out there waiting
for us, and I reckon there will be...

107
00:12:29,834 --> 00:12:32,325
...they won't know which Harry Potter
is the real one.

108
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:33,930
The real one?

109
00:12:35,273 --> 00:12:38,367
I believe you're familiar
with this particular brew.

110
00:12:38,542 --> 00:12:40,840
No. Absolutely not.

111
00:12:41,012 --> 00:12:42,343
I told you he'd take it well.

112
00:12:42,513 --> 00:12:45,641
No, if you think I'm gonna let everyone
risk their lives for me, I--

113
00:12:45,816 --> 00:12:48,876
- Never done that before, have we?
- No. No. This is different.

114
00:12:49,053 --> 00:12:51,044
I mean, taking that, becoming me. No.

115
00:12:51,222 --> 00:12:53,053
Well, none of us really fancy it, mate.

116
00:12:53,224 --> 00:12:57,388
Imagine if something went wrong, and
we ended up a scrawny, specky git forever.

117
00:12:57,561 --> 00:12:59,222
Everyone here is of age, Potter.

118
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:01,363
They've all agreed to take the risk.

119
00:13:02,733 --> 00:13:05,634
Technically, I've been coerced.

120
00:13:05,803 --> 00:13:07,998
Mundungus Fletcher, Mr. Potter.

121
00:13:08,172 --> 00:13:10,732
- Always been a huge admirer.
- Nip it, Mundungus.

122
00:13:12,043 --> 00:13:14,534
All right, Granger, as discussed.

123
00:13:14,712 --> 00:13:17,442
- Blimey, Hermione.
- Straight in here, if you please.

124
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:31,489
For those of you who haven't taken
Polyjuice Potion before, fair warning:

125
00:13:31,662 --> 00:13:33,289
It tastes like goblin piss.

126
00:13:33,464 --> 00:13:36,433
Have a lot of experiences with that,
do you, Mad-Eye?

127
00:13:37,335 --> 00:13:40,270
Just trying to diffuse the tension.

128
00:13:41,305 --> 00:13:43,102
Oh.

129
00:13:46,177 --> 00:13:47,940
Ugh.

130
00:14:12,203 --> 00:14:14,262
Wow, we're identical.

131
00:14:14,438 --> 00:14:15,496
Not yet, you're not.

132
00:14:19,176 --> 00:14:21,736
Haven't got anything
a bit more sporting, have you?

133
00:14:21,912 --> 00:14:23,379
I don't really fancy this color.

134
00:14:23,547 --> 00:14:26,345
Well, fancy this, you're not you.
So shut it and strip.

135
00:14:26,517 --> 00:14:28,075
All right, all right.

136
00:14:28,252 --> 00:14:29,810
You'll need to change too, Potter.

137
00:14:30,321 --> 00:14:32,949
Bill, look away. I'm hideous.

138
00:14:33,124 --> 00:14:35,422
I knew she was lying about that tattoo.

139
00:14:35,593 --> 00:14:38,027
Harry, your eyesight really is awful.

140
00:14:38,195 --> 00:14:41,892
Right, then. We'll be pairing off.
Each Potter will have a protector.

141
00:14:42,066 --> 00:14:45,365
Mundungus, stick tight to me.
I wanna keep an eye on you.

142
00:14:45,903 --> 00:14:47,734
- As for Harry--
- Yes?

143
00:14:48,572 --> 00:14:49,971
The real Harry.

144
00:14:50,141 --> 00:14:52,507
- Where the devil are you, anyway?
- Here.

145
00:14:52,676 --> 00:14:54,644
You'll ride with Hagrid.

146
00:14:54,812 --> 00:14:59,840
I brought you here 16 years ago when
you were no bigger than a Bowtruckle.

147
00:15:00,017 --> 00:15:02,918
Seems only right that I should be
the one to take you away now.

148
00:15:03,087 --> 00:15:06,022
Yes, it's all very touching. Let's go.

149
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:23,238
Head for the Burrows.
We'll rendezvous there.

150
00:15:23,774 --> 00:15:25,833
On the count of three.

151
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:27,739
Hold tight, Harry.

152
00:15:27,912 --> 00:15:29,709
One...

153
00:15:30,581 --> 00:15:32,378
...two...

154
00:15:38,789 --> 00:15:40,586
...three!

155
00:16:10,588 --> 00:16:13,751
- Which one?
- Where are you?

156
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,688
He's on your right!

157
00:16:16,861 --> 00:16:18,488
He's over there!

158
00:16:18,662 --> 00:16:20,323
Down!

159
00:16:25,803 --> 00:16:27,464
Hagrid, we have to help the others!

160
00:16:27,872 --> 00:16:30,773
I can't do that, Harry. Mad-Eye's orders.

161
00:16:37,715 --> 00:16:39,512
Hang on.

162
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,379
<i>Stupefy!</i>

163
00:16:59,103 --> 00:17:00,195
Hang on, Harry.

164
00:17:10,114 --> 00:17:11,979
Hagrid.

165
00:17:29,199 --> 00:17:31,463
No. No.

166
00:17:53,557 --> 00:17:55,548
<i>Harry.</i>

167
00:19:15,506 --> 00:19:18,566
Harry. Hagrid.

168
00:19:19,977 --> 00:19:23,435
What happened? Where are the others?

169
00:19:23,614 --> 00:19:24,774
Is no one else back?

170
00:19:24,948 --> 00:19:28,509
They were on us right from
the start, Molly. We didn't stand a chance.

171
00:19:28,686 --> 00:19:31,849
Well, thank goodness
you two are all right.

172
00:19:32,022 --> 00:19:34,582
The Death Eaters were
waiting for us. It was an ambush.

173
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:37,158
Ron and Tonks
should've already been back.

174
00:19:37,327 --> 00:19:38,521
Dad and Fred as well.

175
00:19:41,465 --> 00:19:43,126
Here!

176
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:47,203
Quick. Into the house.

177
00:19:50,874 --> 00:19:52,933
Oh, my boy.

178
00:19:55,112 --> 00:19:57,603
Oh. Oh.

179
00:19:59,216 --> 00:20:00,513
- Lupin!
- What are you doing?

180
00:20:03,053 --> 00:20:05,988
What creature sat in the corner...

181
00:20:06,156 --> 00:20:09,455
...the first time Harry Potter
visited my office in Hogwarts?

182
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:11,253
- Are you mad?
- What creature?!

183
00:20:11,428 --> 00:20:13,259
A Grindylow.

184
00:20:19,603 --> 00:20:21,264
We've been betrayed.

185
00:20:21,438 --> 00:20:23,838
Voldemort knew
you were being moved tonight.

186
00:20:24,007 --> 00:20:26,908
I had to make sure
you weren't an impostor.

187
00:20:34,051 --> 00:20:35,484
Wait.

188
00:20:38,489 --> 00:20:43,017
The last words Albus Dumbledore spoke
to the pair of us?

189
00:20:44,828 --> 00:20:49,197
"Harry is the best hope we have.
Trust him."

190
00:20:53,737 --> 00:20:54,829
What gave you away?

191
00:20:55,005 --> 00:20:58,202
Hedwig, I think.
She was trying to protect me.

192
00:21:14,758 --> 00:21:15,918
Thanks.

193
00:21:16,093 --> 00:21:18,254
Deserves that. Brilliant, he was.

194
00:21:18,428 --> 00:21:21,522
- I wouldn't be standing here without him.
- Really?

195
00:21:22,533 --> 00:21:25,195
Always the tone of surprise.

196
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:34,604
We the last back?

197
00:21:35,913 --> 00:21:36,937
Where's George?

198
00:21:58,235 --> 00:22:00,465
How you feeling, Georgie?

199
00:22:02,472 --> 00:22:03,996
Saint-like.

200
00:22:05,209 --> 00:22:06,437
Come again?

201
00:22:07,377 --> 00:22:10,938
Saint-like. I'm holy.

202
00:22:11,448 --> 00:22:14,508
I'm holey, Fred. Get it?

203
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:21,019
The whole wide world of ear-related humor
and you go for "I'm holey."

204
00:22:21,191 --> 00:22:22,351
That's pathetic.

205
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,258
Reckon I'm still better-looking than you.

206
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,994
Mad-Eye's dead.

207
00:22:41,378 --> 00:22:45,109
Mundungus took one look at Voldemort
and Disapparated.

208
00:23:08,038 --> 00:23:10,063
<i>Head for the Burrows.</i>

209
00:23:10,874 --> 00:23:12,239
<i>This is beyond anything I imagined.</i>

210
00:23:12,409 --> 00:23:15,037
<i>- Seven?
- Seven...? A Horcrux.</i>

211
00:23:15,212 --> 00:23:16,645
<i>They could be hidden anywhere.</i>

212
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:19,008
<i>To rip the soul into seven pieces....</i>

213
00:23:19,182 --> 00:23:22,151
<i>- If you did destroy each Horcrux....
- One destroys Voldemort.</i>

214
00:23:25,756 --> 00:23:27,383
<i>Trust me.</i>

215
00:23:28,325 --> 00:23:31,886
<i>You lied to me.
Lied to me, Ollivander.</i>

216
00:24:03,827 --> 00:24:05,761
Going somewhere?

217
00:24:09,433 --> 00:24:13,529
Nobody else is going to die. Not for me.

218
00:24:13,704 --> 00:24:15,501
For you?

219
00:24:15,672 --> 00:24:17,902
You think Mad-Eye died for you?

220
00:24:18,075 --> 00:24:21,010
You think George took that curse
for you?

221
00:24:21,778 --> 00:24:25,714
You may be the Chosen One, mate,
but this is a whole lot bigger than that.

222
00:24:25,882 --> 00:24:28,407
It's always been bigger than that.

223
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:33,111
- Come with me.
- What, and leave Hermione?

224
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:37,822
You mad?
We wouldn't last two days without her.

225
00:24:39,229 --> 00:24:40,753
Don't tell her I said that.

226
00:24:42,332 --> 00:24:45,529
Besides,
you've still got the Trace on you.

227
00:24:45,702 --> 00:24:49,798
- We've still got the wedding--
- I don't care about a wedding.

228
00:24:49,973 --> 00:24:54,842
I'm sorry. No matter whose it is.
I have to start finding these Horcruxes.

229
00:24:55,012 --> 00:24:56,980
They're our only chance to beat him...

230
00:24:57,147 --> 00:25:00,116
...and the longer we stay here,
the stronger he gets.

231
00:25:01,551 --> 00:25:03,644
Tonight's not the night, mate.

232
00:25:03,954 --> 00:25:06,422
We'd only be doing him a favor.

233
00:25:34,184 --> 00:25:36,118
Do you think he knows?

234
00:25:36,853 --> 00:25:42,723
I mean, they're bits of his soul,
these Horcruxes. Bits of him.

235
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:47,726
When Dumbledore destroyed the ring,
you destroyed Tom Riddle's diary...

236
00:25:49,232 --> 00:25:51,826
...he must have felt something.

237
00:25:52,602 --> 00:25:56,333
To kill the other Horcruxes,
we have to find them.

238
00:25:56,706 --> 00:25:58,674
Where are they?

239
00:25:59,209 --> 00:26:01,268
Where do we start?

240
00:26:04,714 --> 00:26:05,806
Ready when you are.

241
00:26:07,551 --> 00:26:11,851
Please pay attention!
It's your brother's wedding. Buck up.

242
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,339
Zip me up, will you?

243
00:26:53,196 --> 00:26:55,130
It seems silly, doesn't it, a wedding?

244
00:26:55,632 --> 00:26:57,998
Given everything that's going on.

245
00:26:59,336 --> 00:27:01,395
Maybe that's the best reason to have it...

246
00:27:02,005 --> 00:27:04,530
...because of everything that's going on.

247
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:22,751
Morning.

248
00:27:32,936 --> 00:27:35,097
Come on, keep up.

249
00:27:35,772 --> 00:27:37,433
All together now.

250
00:27:37,607 --> 00:27:43,045
One, two, three.

251
00:27:53,123 --> 00:27:55,557
How's it looking at your end, boys?

252
00:27:56,193 --> 00:27:58,127
Brilliant.

253
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:05,065
Bloody hell.
What's the Minister of Magic doing here?

254
00:28:10,974 --> 00:28:12,839
To what do we owe the pleasure,
Minister?

255
00:28:13,009 --> 00:28:17,571
I think we both know the answer
to that question, Mr. Potter.

256
00:28:25,255 --> 00:28:27,155
And this is...?

257
00:28:35,198 --> 00:28:39,100
"Herein is set forth
the last will and testament...

258
00:28:39,269 --> 00:28:43,865
...of Albus Percival Wulfric
Brian Dumbledore.

259
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:48,500
First, to Ronald Bilius Weasley...

260
00:28:48,678 --> 00:28:51,977
...I leave my Deluminator...

261
00:28:52,148 --> 00:28:54,412
...a device of my own making...

262
00:28:54,584 --> 00:28:59,817
...in the hope that,
when things seem most dark...

263
00:29:01,458 --> 00:29:04,325
...it will show him the light."

264
00:29:10,233 --> 00:29:13,327
- Dumbledore left this for me?
- Yeah.

265
00:29:14,271 --> 00:29:15,863
Brilliant.

266
00:29:16,906 --> 00:29:18,737
What is it?

267
00:29:30,887 --> 00:29:32,479
Wicked.

268
00:29:34,791 --> 00:29:37,760
"To Hermione Jean Granger...

269
00:29:37,927 --> 00:29:43,092
<i>...I leave my copy of
The Tales of Beedle the Bard...</i>

270
00:29:43,266 --> 00:29:47,930
...in the hope that she find it
entertaining and instructive."

271
00:29:48,738 --> 00:29:50,069
Mom used to read me those.

272
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,464
"The Wizard and the Hopping Pot."

273
00:29:52,642 --> 00:29:55,577
"Babbitty Rabbitty
and the Cackling Stump."

274
00:29:57,347 --> 00:30:00,714
Come on, Babbitty Rabbitty.

275
00:30:01,184 --> 00:30:02,879
No?

276
00:30:03,219 --> 00:30:06,017
"To Harry James Potter...

277
00:30:06,556 --> 00:30:10,287
...I leave the Snitch he caught
in his first Quidditch match at Hogwarts...

278
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:15,488
...as a reminder
of the rewards of perseverance...

279
00:30:17,734 --> 00:30:19,929
...and skill."

280
00:30:39,989 --> 00:30:43,049
- Is that it, then?
- Not quite.

281
00:30:43,226 --> 00:30:48,630
Dumbledore left you a second bequest:

282
00:30:48,865 --> 00:30:51,857
The sword of Godric Gryffindor.

283
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:58,066
Unfortunately, the sword of Gryffindor
was not Dumbledore's to give away.

284
00:30:58,475 --> 00:31:01,205
As an important historical artifact,
it belongs--

285
00:31:01,378 --> 00:31:02,470
To Harry.

286
00:31:03,313 --> 00:31:05,247
It belongs to Harry.

287
00:31:05,415 --> 00:31:08,111
It came to him when he needed it
in the Chamber of Secrets.

288
00:31:08,284 --> 00:31:11,185
The sword may present itself
to any worthy Gryffindor.

289
00:31:11,354 --> 00:31:13,686
That does not make it
that wizard's property.

290
00:31:15,125 --> 00:31:18,754
And, in any event, the current
whereabouts of the sword are unknown.

291
00:31:18,928 --> 00:31:21,522
- Excuse me?
- The sword is missing.

292
00:31:22,899 --> 00:31:26,426
I don't know what you're up to,
Mr. Potter...

293
00:31:26,603 --> 00:31:30,562
...but you can't fight this war
on your own.

294
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:33,140
He's too strong.

295
00:32:34,337 --> 00:32:35,599
Hello, Harry.

296
00:32:36,506 --> 00:32:40,499
I've interrupted a deep thought, haven't I?
I can see it growing smaller in your eyes.

297
00:32:40,677 --> 00:32:42,201
Of course not. How are you, Luna?

298
00:32:42,378 --> 00:32:45,006
Very well. Got bitten by a garden gnome
only moments ago.

299
00:32:45,181 --> 00:32:47,513
Gnome saliva is very beneficial.

300
00:32:47,684 --> 00:32:50,050
Xenophilius Lovegood.
We live just over the hill.

301
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,414
Pleasure to meet you, sir.

302
00:32:51,588 --> 00:32:54,352
<i>I trust you know, Mr. Potter,
that we at The Quibbler...</i>

303
00:32:54,524 --> 00:32:56,856
<i>...unlike those toadies
at The Daily Prophet...</i>

304
00:32:57,026 --> 00:32:59,620
...fully supported Dumbledore
in his lifetime...

305
00:32:59,796 --> 00:33:03,459
...and, in his death,
support you just as fully.

306
00:33:03,766 --> 00:33:05,131
Thank you.

307
00:33:05,301 --> 00:33:08,134
Come, Daddy.
Harry doesn't want to talk to us right now.

308
00:33:08,304 --> 00:33:10,602
He's just too polite to say so.

309
00:33:10,773 --> 00:33:12,832
Harry Potter.

310
00:33:16,379 --> 00:33:18,506
Excuse me, sir? May I sit down?

311
00:33:18,681 --> 00:33:22,082
Mr. Potter. By all means. Here.

312
00:33:22,252 --> 00:33:23,913
Thanks.

313
00:33:26,623 --> 00:33:29,922
<i>I found what you wrote
in The Daily Prophet really moving.</i>

314
00:33:30,493 --> 00:33:33,291
You obviously knew Dumbledore well.

315
00:33:33,463 --> 00:33:36,398
Well, I certainly knew him the longest.

316
00:33:36,566 --> 00:33:39,296
That is, if you don't count his brother,
Aberforth...

317
00:33:39,469 --> 00:33:42,495
...and somehow, people never do
seem to count Aberforth.

318
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:44,898
- I didn't even know he had a brother.
- Ah.

319
00:33:45,074 --> 00:33:48,635
Well, Dumbledore was always
very private, even as a boy.

320
00:33:48,811 --> 00:33:50,210
Don't despair, Elphias.

321
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:54,817
I'm told he's been thoroughly
unriddled by Rita Skeeter...

322
00:33:54,984 --> 00:33:57,817
...in 800 pages, no less.

323
00:33:58,454 --> 00:34:02,857
Word has it that someone talked to her.

324
00:34:03,026 --> 00:34:05,824
Someone who knew
the Dumbledore family well.

325
00:34:06,229 --> 00:34:09,824
Both you and I know who that is,
Elphias.

326
00:34:09,999 --> 00:34:11,466
A monstrous betrayal.

327
00:34:13,369 --> 00:34:14,961
Who are we talking about?

328
00:34:16,439 --> 00:34:18,566
Bathilda Bagshot.

329
00:34:20,243 --> 00:34:21,301
- Who?
- My God, boy...

330
00:34:21,477 --> 00:34:26,244
...she's only the most celebrated
magical historian of the last century.

331
00:34:27,951 --> 00:34:32,183
She was as close
to the Dumbledores as anyone.

332
00:34:32,355 --> 00:34:37,383
Oh, I'm sure Rita Skeeter thought
it well worth a trip to Godric's Hollow...

333
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:40,757
...to take a peek
into that old bird's rattled cage.

334
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:42,761
Godric's Hollow?

335
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,099
Bathilda Bagshot
lives at Godric's Hollow?

336
00:34:45,501 --> 00:34:47,594
Well, that's where
she first met Dumbledore.

337
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:49,635
You don't mean to say
he lived there too?

338
00:34:49,806 --> 00:34:53,367
The family moved there
after his father killed those three Muggles.

339
00:34:53,543 --> 00:34:57,172
Oh, it was quite the scandal.

340
00:34:57,347 --> 00:35:02,182
Honestly, my boy,
are you sure you knew him at all?

341
00:35:28,645 --> 00:35:31,739
<i>The Ministry has fallen.</i>

342
00:35:32,382 --> 00:35:36,284
<i>The Minister of Magic is dead.</i>

343
00:35:38,755 --> 00:35:41,053
<i>They are coming.</i>

344
00:35:41,224 --> 00:35:43,317
<i>They are coming.</i>

345
00:35:44,594 --> 00:35:46,084
<i>They are coming.</i>

346
00:35:46,262 --> 00:35:47,729
They're coming!

347
00:35:49,766 --> 00:35:51,597
Nice meeting you, Mr. Potter.

348
00:36:02,679 --> 00:36:05,045
- Ginny!
- Harry! Go!

349
00:36:05,214 --> 00:36:06,272
Go!

350
00:36:19,595 --> 00:36:22,189
Here you go, sightseeing tour?
Leaves in 15 minutes.

351
00:36:23,633 --> 00:36:26,261
- Where are we?
- Shaftesbury Avenue.

352
00:36:26,436 --> 00:36:29,633
I used to come to the theater here
with Mom and Dad.

353
00:36:29,939 --> 00:36:33,033
I don't know why I thought of it.
It just popped into my head.

354
00:36:33,443 --> 00:36:35,274
This way.

355
00:36:39,082 --> 00:36:41,175
We need to change.

356
00:36:47,123 --> 00:36:48,385
How the ruddy...?

357
00:36:48,558 --> 00:36:51,118
Undetectable Extension Charm.

358
00:36:51,561 --> 00:36:53,825
You're amazing, you are.

359
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:56,590
Always the tone of surprise.

360
00:36:58,601 --> 00:37:00,728
Ah. That'll be the books.

361
00:37:06,242 --> 00:37:08,107
What about all the people
at the wedding?

362
00:37:08,277 --> 00:37:10,745
- Do you think we should go back?
- They were after you.

363
00:37:10,913 --> 00:37:13,074
We'd put everyone in danger
by going back.

364
00:37:14,951 --> 00:37:16,680
- Ron's right.
- Ahem.

365
00:37:16,853 --> 00:37:18,514
Coffee?

366
00:37:19,055 --> 00:37:22,081
- A cappuccino, please.
- You?

367
00:37:22,925 --> 00:37:26,224
- What she said.
- Same.

368
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:33,433
So where do we go from here?
Leaky Cauldron?

369
00:37:33,803 --> 00:37:34,895
It's too dangerous.

370
00:37:35,805 --> 00:37:39,332
If Voldemort has taken over the Ministry,
none of the old places are safe.

371
00:37:39,509 --> 00:37:42,569
Everyone from the wedding
will have gone underground, into hiding.

372
00:37:42,745 --> 00:37:45,236
My rucksack with all my things,
I've left it at the Burrow.

373
00:37:50,386 --> 00:37:52,286
You're joking.

374
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:57,849
I've had all the essentials packed
for days, just in case.

375
00:37:58,027 --> 00:38:00,222
By the way, these jeans, not my favorite.

376
00:38:01,397 --> 00:38:02,455
Down!

377
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:04,896
<i>Stupefy!</i>

378
00:38:09,105 --> 00:38:10,834
<i>Expulso!</i>

379
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:22,581
<i>Petrificus Totalus.</i>

380
00:38:26,722 --> 00:38:27,780
Go.

381
00:38:28,224 --> 00:38:29,384
Leave.

382
00:38:34,063 --> 00:38:36,861
Lock the door, get the lights.

383
00:38:46,108 --> 00:38:47,837
This one's name is Rowle.

384
00:38:48,344 --> 00:38:51,780
He was on the Astronomy Tower
the night Snape killed Dumbledore.

385
00:38:52,582 --> 00:38:57,076
This is Dolohov. I recognize him
from the wanted posters.

386
00:38:58,154 --> 00:39:00,315
So, what we gonna do with you, hey?

387
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:03,283
Kill us if it was turned round,
wouldn't you?

388
00:39:03,459 --> 00:39:04,790
If we kill them, they'll know we were here.

389
00:39:04,961 --> 00:39:06,360
Ron.

390
00:39:06,529 --> 00:39:10,488
Suppose he did Mad-Eye.
How would you feel then?

391
00:39:12,468 --> 00:39:14,095
It's better we wipe their memories.

392
00:39:14,971 --> 00:39:16,939
You're the boss.

393
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,003
Hermione...

394
00:39:21,477 --> 00:39:23,945
...you're the best at spells.

395
00:39:41,597 --> 00:39:43,792
<i>Obliviate.</i>

396
00:39:56,145 --> 00:39:57,737
How is it they knew we were there?

397
00:39:57,914 --> 00:39:59,506
Maybe you still have the Trace on you?

398
00:39:59,682 --> 00:40:03,118
Can't be. Trace breaks at 17.
It's wizarding law.

399
00:40:04,921 --> 00:40:06,479
What?

400
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:10,259
We didn't celebrate your birthday, Harry.

401
00:40:10,626 --> 00:40:13,891
Ginny and I, we prepared a cake.

402
00:40:14,063 --> 00:40:17,032
We were going to bring it out
at the end of the wedding.

403
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:20,635
I appreciate the thought, but given the fact
that we were almost killed...

404
00:40:20,803 --> 00:40:23,203
...by a couple of Death Eaters
a few minutes ago....

405
00:40:24,874 --> 00:40:26,569
Right.

406
00:40:27,376 --> 00:40:28,400
Perspective.

407
00:40:28,577 --> 00:40:31,569
We need to get off the streets,
get somewhere safe.

408
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,705
What was that all about?

409
00:41:07,683 --> 00:41:13,519
Probably Mad-Eye's idea,
in case Snape decided to come snooping.

410
00:41:21,697 --> 00:41:23,665
<i>Homenum Revelio.</i>

411
00:41:30,306 --> 00:41:32,137
We're alone.

412
00:41:38,948 --> 00:41:41,178
<i>I believed another wand-</i>

413
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:43,818
<i>You lied to me.
It makes no sense.</i>

414
00:41:46,655 --> 00:41:49,624
I believed a different wand would work,
I swear.

415
00:41:51,127 --> 00:41:53,186
There must be another way.

416
00:43:03,532 --> 00:43:07,263
Harry? Hermione, where are you?

417
00:43:07,536 --> 00:43:09,868
I think I've found something.

418
00:43:16,178 --> 00:43:17,236
Lovely.

419
00:43:22,918 --> 00:43:26,410
"Regulus Arcturus Black."

420
00:43:26,589 --> 00:43:28,284
R.A.B.

421
00:43:31,894 --> 00:43:35,193
"I know I will be dead
long before you read this.

422
00:43:35,364 --> 00:43:39,391
I have stolen the real Horcrux
and intend to destroy it."

423
00:43:39,768 --> 00:43:42,168
R.A.B. is Sirius's brother.

424
00:43:42,605 --> 00:43:44,368
Yes.

425
00:43:46,475 --> 00:43:50,343
Question is,
did he actually destroy the real Horcrux?

426
00:44:12,067 --> 00:44:14,228
You've been spying on us, have you?

427
00:44:14,403 --> 00:44:18,863
Kreacher has been watching.

428
00:44:19,041 --> 00:44:20,975
Maybe he knows where the real locket is.

429
00:44:23,979 --> 00:44:25,913
Have you ever seen this before?

430
00:44:26,081 --> 00:44:27,673
Kreacher?

431
00:44:28,517 --> 00:44:30,951
It's Master Regulus' locket.

432
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:33,816
But there were two, weren't there?

433
00:44:34,823 --> 00:44:36,518
Where's the other one?

434
00:44:39,028 --> 00:44:43,590
Kreacher doesn't know
where the other locket is.

435
00:44:43,766 --> 00:44:46,166
Yes, but did you ever see it?
Was it in this house?

436
00:44:46,335 --> 00:44:47,495
Filthy Mudblood.

437
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:49,365
- Death Eaters are coming--
- Ron.

438
00:44:49,538 --> 00:44:52,371
- Blood traitor, Weasley.
- Answer her.

439
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:56,373
Yes.

440
00:44:57,413 --> 00:45:00,871
It was here in this house.

441
00:45:02,151 --> 00:45:04,483
A most evil object.

442
00:45:04,653 --> 00:45:05,881
How do you mean?

443
00:45:06,655 --> 00:45:10,955
Before Master Regulus died,
he ordered Kreacher to destroy it...

444
00:45:11,126 --> 00:45:16,393
...but no matter how hard Kreacher tried,
he could not do it.

445
00:45:16,565 --> 00:45:18,157
Well, where is it now?

446
00:45:18,801 --> 00:45:23,397
- Did someone take it?
- He came in the night.

447
00:45:23,572 --> 00:45:28,236
He took many things,
including the locket.

448
00:45:28,410 --> 00:45:29,934
Who did?

449
00:45:30,613 --> 00:45:32,205
Who was it, Kreacher?

450
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:37,412
Mundungus.

451
00:45:37,586 --> 00:45:41,078
Mundungus Fletcher.

452
00:45:42,157 --> 00:45:43,749
Find him.

453
00:46:05,281 --> 00:46:06,748
My father will hear about this.

454
00:46:12,054 --> 00:46:13,919
Hey, losers.

455
00:46:14,657 --> 00:46:16,921
He isn't here.

456
00:46:30,539 --> 00:46:32,939
As your new Minister for Magic...

457
00:46:33,142 --> 00:46:38,307
...I promise to restore
this temple of tolerance...

458
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,141
...to its former glory.

459
00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:43,381
Therefore, beginning today...

460
00:46:44,453 --> 00:46:48,219
...each employee
will submit themselves...

461
00:46:48,891 --> 00:46:51,121
...for evaluation.

462
00:46:51,994 --> 00:46:54,986
You have nothing to fear...

463
00:46:56,432 --> 00:46:58,161
...if you have nothing to hide.

464
00:47:02,571 --> 00:47:04,163
- How much?
- Two Galleons.

465
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:06,831
Come on, time is money. Cheers, pal.

466
00:47:07,009 --> 00:47:08,943
- Snatchers!
- Move out of the way.

467
00:47:15,150 --> 00:47:16,617
- I told you.
- Get out.

468
00:47:16,785 --> 00:47:17,809
Squash him.

469
00:47:27,029 --> 00:47:28,656
Be a bit gentler.

470
00:47:54,757 --> 00:47:56,884
They have flesh memories.

471
00:47:59,027 --> 00:48:04,556
When Scrimgeour first gave it to you,
I thought it might open at your touch.

472
00:48:05,401 --> 00:48:08,165
That Dumbledore had hidden
something inside it.

473
00:48:08,404 --> 00:48:10,065
<i>Many of you are wondering...</i>

474
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:13,174
<i>...why Voldemort has yet to show himself
now that he has vanquished...</i>

475
00:48:13,342 --> 00:48:16,402
<i>...the most powerful symbol of opposition
to him and his followers.</i>

476
00:48:18,447 --> 00:48:19,471
Get off.

477
00:48:19,648 --> 00:48:22,412
Harry Potter, so long it's been.

478
00:48:22,885 --> 00:48:24,216
Get off me.

479
00:48:29,825 --> 00:48:33,761
As requested,
Kreacher has returned with the thief...

480
00:48:33,929 --> 00:48:35,920
<i>- Expellliarmus.
- ... Mundungus Fletcher.</i>

481
00:48:36,098 --> 00:48:39,295
What you playing at? Setting a pair
of bleeding house-elves after me.

482
00:48:39,468 --> 00:48:40,958
Dobby was only trying to help.

483
00:48:41,136 --> 00:48:45,505
Dobby saw Kreacher in Diagon Alley,
which Dobby thought was curious.

484
00:48:45,674 --> 00:48:50,008
And then Dobby heard Kreacher
mention Harry Potter's name.

485
00:48:50,179 --> 00:48:53,012
- I just--
- And then Dobby saw Kreacher...

486
00:48:53,182 --> 00:48:55,980
- ...talking with the thief, Mundungus--
- I'm no thief.

487
00:48:56,151 --> 00:48:59,086
You foul little-- Git.

488
00:48:59,488 --> 00:49:03,891
I'm a purveyor
of rare and wondrous objects.

489
00:49:04,059 --> 00:49:05,924
You're a thief, Dung. Everyone knows it.

490
00:49:06,094 --> 00:49:09,063
Master Weasley,
so good to see you again.

491
00:49:09,231 --> 00:49:10,255
Wicked trainers.

492
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,764
Listen, I panicked that night, all right?

493
00:49:16,405 --> 00:49:18,635
Could I help it
if Mad-Eye fell off his broom?

494
00:49:20,642 --> 00:49:22,075
- You....
- Tell the truth.

495
00:49:22,244 --> 00:49:25,008
When you turned this place over--
Don't deny it.

496
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:26,704
--you found a locket, am I right?

497
00:49:26,882 --> 00:49:29,146
Why? Was it valuable?

498
00:49:29,318 --> 00:49:30,444
You still got it?

499
00:49:30,619 --> 00:49:33,053
No, he's worried
he didn't get enough money for it.

500
00:49:33,222 --> 00:49:34,746
Bleeding give it away, didn't I?

501
00:49:36,124 --> 00:49:39,252
There I was,
flogging me wares in Diagon Alley...

502
00:49:39,428 --> 00:49:43,387
...when some Ministry hag comes up
and asks to see me license.

503
00:49:43,632 --> 00:49:45,691
Says she's a mind to lock me up.

504
00:49:45,868 --> 00:49:49,531
And would've done it too,
if she hadn't taken a fancy to that locket.

505
00:49:49,705 --> 00:49:53,641
- Who was she? The witch. Do you know?
- No, I--

506
00:49:58,447 --> 00:50:01,848
Well, she's there. Look.

507
00:50:03,986 --> 00:50:06,352
Bleeding bow and all.

508
00:50:47,195 --> 00:50:50,961
Right, remember what we said.

509
00:50:51,233 --> 00:50:54,964
Don't speak to anyone
unless absolutely necessary.

510
00:50:55,237 --> 00:51:00,140
Just try and act normal.
Do what everybody else is doing.

511
00:51:00,576 --> 00:51:03,704
If we do that, then with a bit of luck,
we'll get inside.

512
00:51:03,879 --> 00:51:05,471
- And then--
- It gets really tricky.

513
00:51:05,647 --> 00:51:07,512
- Correct.
- Yeah.

514
00:51:07,683 --> 00:51:10,584
- This is completely mental.
- Completely.

515
00:51:10,752 --> 00:51:12,777
The world's mental.

516
00:51:12,955 --> 00:51:14,388
Come on...

517
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:17,424
...we've got a Horcrux to find.

518
00:52:11,313 --> 00:52:13,713
We flush ourselves in.

519
00:52:17,753 --> 00:52:20,517
That's bloody disgusting.

520
00:52:48,550 --> 00:52:50,211
Name?

521
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:53,044
You. Come.

522
00:52:53,221 --> 00:52:55,382
- What? What?
- Come on.

523
00:52:55,557 --> 00:52:57,991
- What did I do?
- Just keep walking.

524
00:53:05,367 --> 00:53:07,301
- Are those--?
- Muggles.

525
00:53:07,469 --> 00:53:12,065
In their rightful place.

526
00:53:13,842 --> 00:53:17,039
Gotta tell you,
I'm starting to freak out a bit.

527
00:53:19,314 --> 00:53:23,808
How long did you say this batch
of Polyjuice would last, Hermione?

528
00:53:24,352 --> 00:53:25,376
I didn't.

529
00:53:32,561 --> 00:53:34,495
Cattermole.

530
00:53:35,530 --> 00:53:39,125
It's still raining inside my office.
That's two days now.

531
00:53:41,069 --> 00:53:42,832
Have you tried an umbrella?

532
00:53:43,805 --> 00:53:46,740
You do realize I'm going downstairs,
don't you, Cattermole?

533
00:53:47,309 --> 00:53:51,268
- Downstairs?
- To interrogate your wife.

534
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:56,116
Now, if my wife's blood status
were in doubt...

535
00:53:56,284 --> 00:53:59,185
...and the head of the Department
of Magical Law Enforcement...

536
00:53:59,354 --> 00:54:04,917
...needed a job doing,
I think I might just make that a priority.

537
00:54:05,494 --> 00:54:07,689
You have one hour.

538
00:54:19,441 --> 00:54:25,107
Oh, my God. What am I gonna do?
My wife's all alone downstairs.

539
00:54:25,413 --> 00:54:29,679
- Ron, you don't have a wife.
- Oh, right.

540
00:54:29,851 --> 00:54:31,819
Level 2.</i>

541
00:54:32,621 --> 00:54:34,748
But how do I stop it raining?

542
00:54:34,923 --> 00:54:37,517
<i>Try "Finite Incantatem."</i>

543
00:54:37,692 --> 00:54:39,557
<i>Department of Magical Law Enforcement...</i>

544
00:54:39,728 --> 00:54:41,161
<i>...and Improper Use of Magic Department.</i>

545
00:54:41,329 --> 00:54:43,297
This is you, Ron.

546
00:54:47,536 --> 00:54:52,371
<i>Finite Incantatem. Okay.
And if that doesn't work...?</i>

547
00:55:04,286 --> 00:55:07,221
<i>Level 1,
Minister of Magic and support staff.</i>

548
00:55:07,389 --> 00:55:09,516
If we don't locate Umbridge
within the hour...

549
00:55:09,691 --> 00:55:11,682
...we go find Ron
and come back another day.

550
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:12,884
- Deal?
- Yes.

551
00:55:16,464 --> 00:55:18,796
Ah, Mafalda. Travers sent you, did he?

552
00:55:18,967 --> 00:55:22,027
Good, we'll go straight down.

553
00:55:24,372 --> 00:55:26,897
Albert, aren't you getting out?

554
00:56:00,275 --> 00:56:02,300
Runcorn.

555
00:56:54,796 --> 00:56:56,195
<i>Accio locket.</i>

556
00:57:50,885 --> 00:57:54,048
All right, all right.
Let's calm down, shall we?

557
00:57:54,956 --> 00:57:57,424
Let's get back to work, please.

558
00:57:58,226 --> 00:58:00,057
Calm down.

559
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:07,095
Runcorn.

560
00:58:14,909 --> 00:58:16,672
Morning.

561
00:58:18,380 --> 00:58:20,814
Ron, it's me.

562
00:58:20,982 --> 00:58:24,816
Harry.
Blimey, forgot what you looked like.

563
00:58:24,986 --> 00:58:26,419
Where's Hermione?

564
00:58:26,588 --> 00:58:30,024
She's gone down to the courtrooms,
with Umbridge.

565
00:58:36,865 --> 00:58:38,992
Bloody cold down here.

566
00:58:39,167 --> 00:58:42,762
I'm a half-blood. My father was a wizard.

567
00:58:42,937 --> 00:58:45,269
William Alderton.
He worked here for 30 years.

568
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:48,876
Perhaps you know him.
Always wore his jacket inside out.

569
00:58:49,044 --> 00:58:51,512
No, there's been a mistake.
I'm half-blood, you see.

570
00:58:51,679 --> 00:58:54,876
We must go back. I'm half-blood.

571
00:59:04,993 --> 00:59:07,086
- Mary Elizabeth Cattermole?
- Yes.

572
00:59:07,262 --> 00:59:12,199
Of 27 Chislehurst Gardens,
Great Tolling, Evesham?

573
00:59:12,367 --> 00:59:13,391
- Yes.
- It's here.

574
00:59:13,568 --> 00:59:18,369
Mother to Maisie, Ellie and Alfred?
Wife to Reginald?

575
00:59:22,577 --> 00:59:23,635
Reg?

576
00:59:35,223 --> 00:59:37,054
Thank you, Albert.

577
00:59:39,661 --> 00:59:42,391
Mary Elizabeth Cattermole?

578
00:59:44,599 --> 00:59:45,657
Yes.

579
00:59:46,701 --> 00:59:50,228
A wand was taken from you
upon your arrival at the Ministry today.

580
00:59:50,405 --> 00:59:53,169
Is this that wand?

581
00:59:55,009 --> 00:59:59,537
Would you please tell the court from
which witch or wizard you took this wand?

582
00:59:59,714 --> 01:00:02,148
I didn't take it.

583
01:00:03,384 --> 01:00:09,186
I got it in Diagon Alley, at Ollivander's,
when I was 11.

584
01:00:10,625 --> 01:00:13,116
It chose me.

585
01:00:14,496 --> 01:00:16,259
You're lying.

586
01:00:16,698 --> 01:00:21,260
Wands only choose witches,
and you are not a witch.

587
01:00:21,436 --> 01:00:23,461
But I am.

588
01:00:23,905 --> 01:00:26,965
Tell them, Reg. Tell them what I am.

589
01:00:29,511 --> 01:00:30,876
Reg, tell them what I am.

590
01:00:40,855 --> 01:00:42,618
What on earth are you doing, Albert?

591
01:00:45,527 --> 01:00:47,427
You're lying, Dolores.

592
01:00:49,797 --> 01:00:52,357
And one mustn't tell lies.

593

It is, isn't it?
This'll be one to tell the kids.

Get the kids.

I'll meet you there. We have to get out
of the country, understand?

601
01:01:58,466 --> 01:02:00,934
Mary, do as I say.

602
01:02:15,350 --> 01:02:16,510
Mary?

603
01:02:18,152 --> 01:02:20,052

Long story. Nice meeting you.

It's Harry Potter.

606
01:02:26,427 --> 01:02:28,395
It's Harry. Harry Potter.

607
01:02:28,563 --> 01:02:30,588
- There he is.

608
01:02:30,765 --> 01:02:32,858
- Get him!
- Stop him!

609
01:02:44,779 --> 01:02:45,939

I know, just do it.

- ...to be going back to Grimmauld Place.

I knew once he'd seen where we were,
we couldn't stay...

Protego Totalum.</i>

638
01:05:35,783 --> 01:05:37,910
Where am I supposed to find a tent?

639
01:05:38,085 --> 01:05:42,385
<i>Repello Muggletum. Muffliato.</i>

640
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:54,600
You first.

641
01:05:57,605 --> 01:05:59,698
<i>Dissendium.</i>

642
01:06:13,321 --> 01:06:15,221
<i>Incendio.</i>

643
01:06:20,628 --> 01:06:22,653
<i>Expulso.</i>

644
01:06:29,871 --> 01:06:31,998
<i>Diffindo.</i>

645
01:06:33,441 --> 01:06:34,465
<i>Reducto.</i>

646
01:06:55,897 --> 01:06:57,762
What are you doing?

647
01:06:59,166 --> 01:07:01,930
We have to keep it safe
until we find out how to destroy it.

648
01:07:02,103 --> 01:07:04,799
Seems strange, mate.
Dumbledore sends you off...

649
01:07:04,972 --> 01:07:08,738
...to find all these Horcruxes,
but doesn't tell you how to destroy them.

650
01:07:08,910 --> 01:07:10,537
Doesn't that bother you?

651
01:07:22,924 --> 01:07:26,325
<i>A goblin by
the name of Gornuk was killed.</i>

652
01:07:26,494 --> 01:07:29,554
<i>It is believed that Muggle-born
Dean Thomas and a second goblin...</i>

653
01:07:29,730 --> 01:07:32,665
<i>...both believed to have been traveling
with Tonks, Cresswell...</i>

654
01:07:32,833 --> 01:07:34,357
<i>...and Gornuk, may have escaped.</i>

655
01:07:34,535 --> 01:07:38,301
<i>If Dean is listening or anyone has
any knowledge of his whereabouts...</i>

656
01:07:38,472 --> 01:07:41,532
<i>...his parents and sisters
are desperate for news.</i>

657
01:07:41,709 --> 01:07:45,076
<i>Meanwhile, a Muggle family of five
has been found dead in their home.</i>

658
01:07:45,246 --> 01:07:48,511
<i>You know the spell, Harry.</i>

659
01:07:52,253 --> 01:07:53,515
<i>Tell me.</i>

660
01:07:56,157 --> 01:07:57,988
<i>Tell me, Gregorovitch.</i>

661
01:07:58,159 --> 01:07:59,786
It was stolen from me.

662
01:07:59,961 --> 01:08:03,419
Who was he? The thief?

663
01:08:06,567 --> 01:08:10,526
<i>It was a boy.
It was he who took it.</i>

664
01:08:10,905 --> 01:08:13,203
<i>I never saw it again.</i>

665
01:08:13,374 --> 01:08:15,171
I swear on my life.

666
01:08:16,043 --> 01:08:17,203
I believe you.

667
01:08:23,217 --> 01:08:24,946
<i>Avada Kedavra!</i>

668
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:41,090
I thought it had stopped.

669
01:08:43,004 --> 01:08:45,438
You can't keep letting him in, Harry.

670
01:08:47,508 --> 01:08:50,443
You-Know-Who has found Gregorovitch.

671
01:08:50,745 --> 01:08:52,303
The wandmaker?

672
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:57,008
He wants something
that Gregorovitch used to have...

673
01:08:57,184 --> 01:08:58,651
...but I don't know what.

674
01:08:58,819 --> 01:09:04,815
But he wants it desperately.
I mean, it's as if his life depends on it.

675
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:07,884
Don't.

676
01:09:08,062 --> 01:09:10,257
- It comforts him.
- It sets my teeth on edge.

677
01:09:10,431 --> 01:09:12,661
What's he expecting to hear,
good news?

678
01:09:12,833 --> 01:09:15,700
<i>- who long expected it,
the fall of the Ministry was shocking.</i>

679
01:09:15,870 --> 01:09:18,236
I think he just hopes
he doesn't hear bad news.

680
01:09:18,406 --> 01:09:20,340
<i>We promise
to remain your eyes and ears-</i>

681
01:09:20,508 --> 01:09:21,941
How long before he can travel?

682
01:09:22,109 --> 01:09:25,306
<i>- bringing you news when we can,
from wherever we can.</i>

683
01:09:25,479 --> 01:09:26,776
I'm doing everything I can.

684
01:09:26,947 --> 01:09:28,471
You're not doing enough!

685
01:09:31,218 --> 01:09:33,243
Take it off.

686
01:09:34,021 --> 01:09:36,581
I said, take it off now.

687
01:09:47,601 --> 01:09:50,331
- Better?
- Loads.

688
01:09:54,041 --> 01:09:56,305
We'll take it in turns, okay?

689
01:10:25,372 --> 01:10:28,739
<i>Finch does admit
his invention currently has one short.</i>

690
01:10:28,909 --> 01:10:30,376
<i>And now, other news:</i>

691
01:10:30,544 --> 01:10:33,809
<i>Severus Snape, newly-appointed
headmaster of Hogwarts...</i>

692
01:10:33,981 --> 01:10:37,747
<i>...has decreed that all students
must conform to the latest house rules.</i>

693
01:11:05,379 --> 01:11:09,816
<i>Hogwarts bears little resemblance to the
school under Dumbledore's leadership.</i>

694
01:11:09,984 --> 01:11:13,613
<i>Snape's curriculum is severe,
reflecting the wishes of the Dark Lord...</i>

695
01:11:14,455 --> 01:11:19,392
<i>...and infractions are dealt with harshly
by the two Death Eaters on staff.</i>

696
01:11:38,879 --> 01:11:40,210
What's that?

697
01:11:49,490 --> 01:11:52,254
What's that smell?

698
01:12:14,715 --> 01:12:16,740
- What you doing?
- It's heavy.

699
01:12:16,917 --> 01:12:18,509
Oh, sorry. Do you want me to carry it?

700
01:12:18,686 --> 01:12:21,621
- Yeah, thank you.
- Don't be ridiculous. Pick it up.

701
01:12:23,190 --> 01:12:24,214
Numpty.

702
01:12:29,330 --> 01:12:31,321
Snatchers.

703
01:12:32,366 --> 01:12:34,800
Good to know your enchantments work.

704
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:43,469
He could smell it. My perfume.

705
01:12:45,679 --> 01:12:47,738
I've told you...

706
01:12:48,215 --> 01:12:50,046
...Ron isn't strong enough to Apparate.

707
01:12:50,217 --> 01:12:53,948
Well, then, we'll go on foot.

708
01:12:54,755 --> 01:12:59,692
And next time, Hermione, as much as
I like your perfume, just don't wear any.

709
01:13:04,598 --> 01:13:08,466
<i>And now for the names
of missing witches and wizards.</i>

710
01:13:09,336 --> 01:13:11,497
<i>These are confirmed.</i>

711
01:13:12,339 --> 01:13:15,706
<i>Thankfully, the list is short today.</i>

712
01:13:16,443 --> 01:13:18,502
<i>Jason and Alison Denbright.</i>

713
01:13:19,380 --> 01:13:20,404
Oh. Thank you.

714
01:13:20,581 --> 01:13:24,312
<i>Bella, Jake, Charlie, and Madge Farley.</i>

715
01:13:24,652 --> 01:13:25,676
<i>Joe Laurie.</i>

716
01:13:26,987 --> 01:13:29,581
<i>Eleanor Sarah Gibbs.</i>

717
01:13:30,758 --> 01:13:34,057
<i>Harry and Bronwyn Trigg.</i>

718
01:13:35,696 --> 01:13:38,722
<i>Rob and Ellie Dowson.</i>

719
01:13:39,833 --> 01:13:42,358
<i>Georgia Clark-Day.</i>

720
01:13:42,937 --> 01:13:45,462
<i>Joshua Flexson.</i>

721
01:13:45,873 --> 01:13:47,363
<i>George Coutas.</i>

722
01:13:48,509 --> 01:13:51,342
<i>Gabriella and Emily Mather.</i>

723
01:13:52,379 --> 01:13:55,473
<i>Jacob and Mimi Erland.</i>

724
01:13:56,550 --> 01:13:58,040
<i>William and Brian Gallagher.</i>

725
01:13:58,218 --> 01:14:00,652
He doesn't know
what he's doing, does he?

726
01:14:03,490 --> 01:14:05,390
None of us do.

727
01:14:07,962 --> 01:14:10,726
<i>Toby and Olivia Gleaves.</i>

728
01:14:11,598 --> 01:14:14,226
<i>Katie and James Killick.</i>

729
01:14:14,401 --> 01:14:16,926
<i>Elsie Valentine Schroeder.</i>

730
01:14:17,972 --> 01:14:20,065
<i>Jennifer Winston.</i>

731
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:23,334
<i>Tamsin and lola Hillicker.</i>

732
01:14:24,545 --> 01:14:25,569
<i>Scarlet and Kitty Sharp.</i>

733
01:14:44,618 --> 01:14:46,449
Oh, my God.

734
01:14:46,821 --> 01:14:48,448
What?

735
01:14:49,023 --> 01:14:51,048
I'll tell you in a minute.

736
01:14:51,592 --> 01:14:54,288
Maybe you could tell me now.

737
01:14:54,662 --> 01:14:57,688
The sword of Gryffindor,
it's goblin-made.

738
01:14:57,865 --> 01:14:58,957
Brilliant.

739
01:15:00,034 --> 01:15:02,434
No, you don't understand.

740
01:15:02,770 --> 01:15:05,136
Dirt and rust have no effect
on the blade.

741
01:15:06,140 --> 01:15:09,507
It only takes in
that which makes it stronger.

742
01:15:09,910 --> 01:15:11,275
Okay.

743
01:15:11,445 --> 01:15:14,937
Harry, you've already destroyed
one Horcrux, right?

744
01:15:15,116 --> 01:15:17,380
Tom Riddle's diary
in the Chamber of Secrets.

745
01:15:17,551 --> 01:15:20,452
With a Basilisk fang.
If you tell me you've got one of those...

746
01:15:20,621 --> 01:15:24,079
- ...in that bloody beaded bag of yours....
- Don't you see?

747
01:15:24,258 --> 01:15:27,989
In the Chamber of Secrets, you stabbed
the Basilisk with the sword of Gryffindor.

748
01:15:28,162 --> 01:15:31,689
Its blade is impregnated
with Basilisk venom.

749
01:15:31,866 --> 01:15:33,959
It only takes in
that which makes it stronger.

750
01:15:34,135 --> 01:15:37,298
- Exactly, which is why--
- It can destroy Horcruxes.

751
01:15:37,471 --> 01:15:39,735
That's why Dumbledore left it to you
in his will.

752
01:15:39,907 --> 01:15:44,310
You are brilliant, Hermione. Truly.

753
01:15:44,478 --> 01:15:48,539
Actually, I'm highly logical, which
allows me to look past extraneous detail...

754
01:15:48,716 --> 01:15:51,207
...and perceive clearly
that which others overlook.

755
01:15:51,385 --> 01:15:54,081
Yeah, there's only one problem,
of course.

756
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:01,587
The sword was stolen.

757
01:16:02,997 --> 01:16:05,522
Yeah, I'm still here.

758
01:16:06,033 --> 01:16:10,163
But you two carry on.
Don't let me spoil the fun.

759
01:16:11,539 --> 01:16:15,532
- What's wrong?
- Wrong? Nothing's wrong.

760
01:16:15,709 --> 01:16:17,609
Not according to you, anyway.

761
01:16:17,778 --> 01:16:21,407
Look, if you've got something to say,
don't be shy. Spit it out.

762
01:16:21,782 --> 01:16:25,081
All right, I'll spit it out.
But don't expect me to be grateful...

763
01:16:25,252 --> 01:16:27,777
...because there's another damn thing
we've gotta find.

764
01:16:27,955 --> 01:16:30,219
I thought you knew
what you signed up for.

765
01:16:30,724 --> 01:16:32,589
Yeah. I thought I did too.

766
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:35,786
Well then, I'm sorry,
but I don't quite understand.

767
01:16:35,963 --> 01:16:39,421
What part of this isn't living up
to your expectations?

768
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:41,864
Did you think we were gonna
be staying in a hotel?

769
01:16:42,036 --> 01:16:45,301
Finding a Horcrux every other day?
Thought you'd be back by Christmas?

770
01:16:45,472 --> 01:16:47,303
I just thought, after all this time...

771
01:16:47,474 --> 01:16:50,910
...we would've achieved something.
I thought you knew what you were doing.

772
01:16:51,078 --> 01:16:53,478
I thought Dumbledore told you
something worthwhile.

773
01:16:53,647 --> 01:16:56,844
- I thought you had a plan.
- I told you everything Dumbledore told me.

774
01:16:57,017 --> 01:16:59,212
In case you haven't noticed,
we found a Horcrux.

775
01:16:59,386 --> 01:17:03,254
Yeah, and we're as close to getting rid of it
as we are to finding the rest of them.

776
01:17:03,424 --> 01:17:06,018
Ron. Please, take--

777
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:08,960
Take the Horcrux off.
You wouldn't be saying this...

778
01:17:09,129 --> 01:17:10,460
...if you hadn't been wearing it all day.

779
01:17:10,631 --> 01:17:13,031
Want to know why I listen to that radio?

780
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:17,864
To make sure I don't hear Ginny's name,
or Fred, or George or Mom.

781
01:17:18,038 --> 01:17:21,201
You think I'm not listening?
You think I don't know how this feels?!

782
01:17:21,375 --> 01:17:22,842
No, you don't know how it feels!

783
01:17:23,010 --> 01:17:25,376
Your parents are dead.
You have no family.

784
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:29,210
- Stop. Stop.
- Fine, then go!

785
01:17:30,050 --> 01:17:31,210
Go, then!

786
01:17:34,121 --> 01:17:35,145
Fine.

787
01:17:38,292 --> 01:17:39,953
Ron.

788
01:17:43,197 --> 01:17:44,994
And you?

789
01:17:46,734 --> 01:17:49,259
Are you coming or you staying?

790
01:17:56,377 --> 01:17:59,437
Fine. I get it.

791
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:02,048
I saw you two the other night.

792
01:18:02,449 --> 01:18:04,883
Ron, that's-- That's nothing.

793
01:18:07,021 --> 01:18:08,386
Ron--

794
01:18:11,592 --> 01:18:13,924
Ron, where are you going?

795
01:18:14,928 --> 01:18:17,158
Please, come back.

796
01:18:18,632 --> 01:18:20,327
Ron.

797
01:18:25,039 --> 01:18:26,063
Ron!

798
01:19:28,369 --> 01:19:30,997
<i>Salvio Hexia.</i>

799
01:19:34,475 --> 01:19:36,909
<i>Repellum Muggletum.</i>

800
01:19:39,980 --> 01:19:42,414
<i>Salvio Hexia.</i>

801
01:20:03,737 --> 01:20:06,399
<i>Poor old Jim's white as a ghost</i>

802
01:20:07,207 --> 01:20:10,404
<i>He's found the answer that we lost</i>

803
01:20:10,811 --> 01:20:14,247
<i>We're all weeping now
Weeping because</i>

804
01:20:14,815 --> 01:20:20,378
<i>There ain't nothing we can do
To protect you</i>

805
01:20:20,754 --> 01:20:24,246
<i>O children</i>

806
01:20:28,195 --> 01:20:31,926
<i>Lift up your voice</i>

807
01:20:32,099 --> 01:20:37,594
<i>Lift up your voice</i>

808
01:20:37,771 --> 01:20:40,001
<i>Children</i>

809
01:20:43,710 --> 01:20:49,444
<i>Rejoice, rejoice</i>

810
01:20:49,616 --> 01:20:53,017
<i>Hey, little train, we're jumping on</i>

811
01:20:53,187 --> 01:20:56,918
<i>The train that goes to the kingdom</i>

812
01:20:57,458 --> 01:21:00,621
<i>We're happy, Ma
We're having fun</i>

813
01:21:00,794 --> 01:21:04,924
<i>And the train ain't even left the station</i>

814
01:21:05,098 --> 01:21:08,465
<i>Hey, little train, wait for me</i>

815
01:21:08,669 --> 01:21:12,503
<i>I once was blind but now I see</i>

816
01:21:12,673 --> 01:21:16,006
<i>Have you left a seat for me?

817
01:21:16,176 --> 01:21:20,306
<i>Is that such a stretch of the imagination?</i>

818
01:21:20,481 --> 01:21:23,814
<i>Hey, little train, wait for me</i>

819
01:21:23,984 --> 01:21:27,852
<i>I was held in chains but now I'm free</i>

820
01:21:28,155 --> 01:21:31,056
<i>I'm hanging in there
Don't you see?</i>

821
01:21:31,225 --> 01:21:35,685
<i>In this process of elimination</i>

822
01:21:35,863 --> 01:21:38,991
<i>Hey, little train, we're jumping on</i>

823
01:21:39,233 --> 01:21:42,691
<i>The train that goes to the kingdom</i>

824
01:21:43,303 --> 01:21:46,602
<i>We're happy, Ma
We're having fun</i>

825
01:21:46,773 --> 01:21:50,675
<i>It's beyond my wildest expectation</i>

826
01:21:50,844 --> 01:21:54,075
<i>Hey, little train, we're jumping on</i>

827
01:21:54,248 --> 01:21:57,877
<i>The train that goes to the kingdom</i>

828
01:21:58,418 --> 01:22:01,615
<i>We're happy, Ma
We're having fun</i>

829
01:22:01,788 --> 01:22:06,657
<i>The train ain't even left the station</i>

830
01:22:53,373 --> 01:22:54,863
Hermione.

831
01:22:55,042 --> 01:22:57,374
Hermione? You were right.

832
01:22:57,544 --> 01:22:59,102
Snitches have flesh memories...

833
01:22:59,279 --> 01:23:03,909
...but I didn't catch the first Snitch
with my hand, I almost swallowed it.

834
01:23:09,189 --> 01:23:11,953
- "I open at the close."
- What do you think that means?

835
01:23:12,125 --> 01:23:13,524
I don't know.

836
01:23:15,929 --> 01:23:18,329
I found something as well.

837
01:23:24,705 --> 01:23:28,163
At first I thought it was an eye,
but now I don't think it is.

838
01:23:28,342 --> 01:23:32,506
It isn't a rune, and it isn't anywhere
in Spellman's Syllabary.

839
01:23:32,980 --> 01:23:36,074
Somebody inked it in.
It isn't part of the book. Somebody drew it.

840
01:23:36,249 --> 01:23:39,912
Luna's dad was wearing that
at Bill and Fleur's wedding.

841
01:23:42,656 --> 01:23:45,955
Why would someone draw it
in a children's book?

842
01:23:48,562 --> 01:23:50,996
Look, Hermione, I've been thinking.

843
01:23:51,565 --> 01:23:53,658
I want to go to Godric's Hollow.

844
01:23:53,834 --> 01:23:56,894
It's where I was born.
It's where my parents died.

845
01:23:57,070 --> 01:24:00,665
That's exactly where he'll expect you to go
because it means something to you.

846
01:24:00,841 --> 01:24:03,275
Yeah, but it means something to him too,
Hermione.

847
01:24:03,443 --> 01:24:05,434
You-Know-Who almost died there.

848
01:24:05,612 --> 01:24:10,276
I mean, isn't that exactly the type of place
he'd be likely to hide a Horcrux?

849
01:24:11,251 --> 01:24:13,811
It's dangerous, Harry.

850
01:24:15,422 --> 01:24:19,415
But even I have to admit, recently
I've been thinking we'll have to go there.

851
01:24:19,593 --> 01:24:22,027
I think it's possible
something else is hidden there.

852
01:24:22,195 --> 01:24:23,719
What?

853
01:24:24,431 --> 01:24:26,126
The sword.

854
01:24:26,700 --> 01:24:30,500
If Dumbledore wanted you to find it,
but didn't want it in the Ministry's hands...

855
01:24:30,671 --> 01:24:34,869
...where better to hide it than
the birthplace of the founder of Gryffindor?

856
01:24:36,209 --> 01:24:38,074
Hermione....

857
01:24:43,316 --> 01:24:46,046
Don't ever let me
give you a haircut again.

858
01:25:07,307 --> 01:25:09,969
I still think we should've used
Polyjuice Potion.

859
01:25:10,143 --> 01:25:11,667
No.

860
01:25:12,345 --> 01:25:14,540
This is where I was born.

861
01:25:14,881 --> 01:25:17,281
I'm not returning as someone else.

862
01:25:27,094 --> 01:25:30,086
Good night. Ha-ha-ha.

863
01:25:33,133 --> 01:25:35,897
Harry, I think it's Christmas Eve.

864
01:25:37,404 --> 01:25:38,701
Listen.

865
01:25:44,411 --> 01:25:47,244
Do you think they'd be in there,
Hermione?

866
01:25:47,681 --> 01:25:49,672
My mom and dad.

867
01:25:55,622 --> 01:25:57,886
Yeah, I think they would.

868
01:26:34,461 --> 01:26:37,521
"Ignotus Peverell."

869
01:26:39,599 --> 01:26:41,226
Hey, Harry?

870
01:27:19,105 --> 01:27:21,300
Merry Christmas, Hermione.

871
01:27:22,609 --> 01:27:24,839
Merry Christmas, Harry.

872
01:27:44,698 --> 01:27:50,102
Harry, there's someone
watching us. By the church.

873
01:28:00,814 --> 01:28:02,645
I think I know who that is.

874
01:28:04,517 --> 01:28:05,950
I don't like this, Harry.

875
01:28:06,119 --> 01:28:11,147
Hermione, she knew
Dumbledore. She might have the sword.

876
01:28:30,010 --> 01:28:31,637
This is where they died, Hermione.

877
01:28:39,219 --> 01:28:41,687
This is where he murdered them.

878
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:56,134
You're Bathilda, aren't you?

879
01:29:01,741 --> 01:29:03,834
Here, let me do that.

880
01:29:27,968 --> 01:29:31,870
Miss Bagshot, who is this man?

881
01:29:43,483 --> 01:29:45,144
Harry.

882
01:29:49,189 --> 01:29:51,054
<i>Lumos.</i>

883
01:31:31,424 --> 01:31:32,448
Harry!

884
01:32:23,276 --> 01:32:24,334
<i>Confringo!</i>

885
01:33:07,086 --> 01:33:09,213
Are you feeling better?

886
01:33:12,292 --> 01:33:14,760
You've outdone yourself this time,
Hermione.

887
01:33:14,928 --> 01:33:17,021
The Forest of Dean.

888
01:33:17,997 --> 01:33:22,366
I came here once with Mom and Dad,
years ago.

889
01:33:23,002 --> 01:33:25,129
It's just how I remember it.

890
01:33:25,538 --> 01:33:29,474
The trees, the river, everything.

891
01:33:29,776 --> 01:33:32,609
Like nothing's changed.

892
01:33:33,846 --> 01:33:36,838
Not true, of course.
Everything's changed.

893
01:33:37,817 --> 01:33:41,617
If I brought my parents back here now,
they probably wouldn't recognize any of it.

894
01:33:43,723 --> 01:33:47,853
Not the trees, not the river...

895
01:33:49,629 --> 01:33:51,756
...not even me.

896
01:33:56,903 --> 01:33:59,701
Maybe we should just stay here, Harry.

897
01:34:01,708 --> 01:34:03,835
Grow old.

898
01:34:09,849 --> 01:34:13,148
You wanted to know
who the boy in the photograph was.

899
01:34:13,886 --> 01:34:14,978
I know.

900
01:34:16,155 --> 01:34:18,555
Gellert Grindelwald.

901
01:34:25,498 --> 01:34:28,899
He's the thief I saw
in Gregorovitch's Wand Shop.

902
01:34:29,068 --> 01:34:32,333
Speaking of which, where is my wand?

903
01:34:33,673 --> 01:34:36,073
Where's my wand, Hermione?

904
01:34:44,717 --> 01:34:49,211
As we were leaving Godric's Hollow,
I cast a curse and it rebounded.

905
01:34:51,958 --> 01:34:53,186
I'm sorry.

906
01:34:53,860 --> 01:34:56,488
- I tried to mend it, but wands are different.
- It's done.

907
01:34:58,464 --> 01:35:02,423
Leave me yours.
Go inside and get warm.

908
01:35:02,835 --> 01:35:05,167
I'll take the locket as well.

909
01:35:17,717 --> 01:35:19,082
<i>Trust me.</i>

910
01:36:44,837 --> 01:36:46,464
<i>Lumos.</i>

911
01:37:27,547 --> 01:37:28,912
<i>Accio sword.</i>

912
01:37:34,754 --> 01:37:36,654
<i>Diffindo.</i>

913
01:39:17,089 --> 01:39:20,252
- Hermione?
- Are you mental?

914
01:39:21,460 --> 01:39:23,018
It was you?

915
01:39:23,195 --> 01:39:26,961
Well, yeah. Bit obvious, I think.

916
01:39:27,133 --> 01:39:28,930
And you cast the doe as well, did you?

917
01:39:29,502 --> 01:39:33,165
- No, I thought that was you.
- No, my Patronus is a stag.

918
01:39:33,339 --> 01:39:35,534
Right. Yeah. Antlers.

919
01:39:38,711 --> 01:39:41,874
Okay, Ron. Do it.

920
01:39:42,848 --> 01:39:46,579
I can't handle it. That thing affects me
more than it affects you and Hermione.

921
01:39:47,119 --> 01:39:49,747
- All the more reason.
- No. I can't.

922
01:39:49,922 --> 01:39:51,150
Then why are you here?

923
01:39:52,558 --> 01:39:54,617
Why did you come back?

924
01:40:02,201 --> 01:40:06,331
Now, I'll have to speak to it in order for it
to open. When it does, don't hesitate.

925
01:40:06,939 --> 01:40:09,464
I don't know what's in there,
but it'll put up a fight.

926
01:40:09,642 --> 01:40:12,338
The bit of Riddle that was in that diary
tried to kill me.

927
01:40:14,814 --> 01:40:16,441
All right.

928
01:40:17,283 --> 01:40:18,841
One...

929
01:40:19,518 --> 01:40:20,576
...two...

930
01:40:21,253 --> 01:40:23,153
...three.

931
01:40:33,399 --> 01:40:38,496
<i>I have seen your heart,
and it is mine.</i>

932
01:40:41,107 --> 01:40:45,009
<i>I have seen your dreams,
Ronald Weasley...</i>

933
01:40:45,177 --> 01:40:47,577
<i>...and I have seen your fears.</i>

934
01:40:49,281 --> 01:40:53,445
<i>Least loved by your mother,
who craved a daughter.</i>

935
01:40:54,086 --> 01:40:59,080
<i>Least loved by the girl
who prefers your friend.</i>

936
01:40:59,258 --> 01:41:01,988
Ron, kill it!

937
01:41:08,434 --> 01:41:11,130
We were better without you.

938
01:41:11,637 --> 01:41:13,366
Happier without you.

939
01:41:13,539 --> 01:41:18,909
Who could look at you
compared to Harry Potter?

940
01:41:20,146 --> 01:41:23,479
What are you
compared with the Chosen One?

941
01:41:23,649 --> 01:41:24,809
Ron, it's lying!

942
01:41:24,984 --> 01:41:27,976
Your mother confessed
she would have preferred me as a son.

943
01:41:28,154 --> 01:41:31,146
What woman would take you?

944
01:41:31,357 --> 01:41:34,520
You are nothing.

945
01:41:34,694 --> 01:41:35,820
Nothing.

946
01:41:36,595 --> 01:41:40,622
Nothing compared to him.

947
01:42:31,183 --> 01:42:32,844
Just think...

948
01:42:33,753 --> 01:42:35,846
...only three to go.

949
01:42:38,891 --> 01:42:40,620
Hermione?

950
01:42:42,895 --> 01:42:44,624
Hermione?

951
01:42:49,168 --> 01:42:51,102
Is everything all right?

952
01:42:51,737 --> 01:42:56,401
It's fine.
Actually, you know, it's more than fine.

953
01:43:00,846 --> 01:43:02,438
Hey.

954
01:43:06,685 --> 01:43:12,885
You complete ass, Ronald Weasley!

955
01:43:13,058 --> 01:43:16,721
You show up here after weeks,
and you say "hey"?

956
01:43:18,931 --> 01:43:21,661
- Where's my wand? Where's my wand?
- I don't know.

957
01:43:21,834 --> 01:43:24,098
- Harry Potter, give me my wand.
- I don't have it.

958
01:43:24,270 --> 01:43:28,104
- How come he's got your wand?
- Never mind why he's got my wand.

959
01:43:30,376 --> 01:43:31,604
What is that?

960
01:43:34,547 --> 01:43:35,571
You destroyed it.

961
01:43:38,884 --> 01:43:42,843
And how is it that you just happen
to have the sword of Gryffindor?

962
01:43:43,255 --> 01:43:45,223
It's a long story.

963
01:43:48,394 --> 01:43:52,490
- Don't think this changes anything.
- Oh, of course not.

964
01:43:52,665 --> 01:43:55,930
I only just destroyed a bloody Horcrux.
Why would that change anything?

965
01:43:56,101 --> 01:44:00,162
Look, I wanted to come back
as soon as I left.

966
01:44:00,339 --> 01:44:03,775
- I just didn't know how to find you.
- Yeah, how did you find us?

967
01:44:03,943 --> 01:44:07,003
With this. It doesn't just turn off lights.

968
01:44:07,179 --> 01:44:12,082
I don't know how it works, but Christmas
morning I was sleeping in this little pub...

969
01:44:12,251 --> 01:44:14,685
...keeping away from some Snatchers...

970
01:44:15,120 --> 01:44:16,382
...and I heard it.

971
01:44:16,789 --> 01:44:18,222
It?

972
01:44:19,558 --> 01:44:21,492
A voice...

973
01:44:23,095 --> 01:44:24,289
...your voice, Hermione...

974
01:44:25,464 --> 01:44:27,091
...coming out of it.

975
01:44:27,266 --> 01:44:31,100
- And what exactly did I say, may I ask?
- My name.

976
01:44:31,704 --> 01:44:33,729
Just my name.

977
01:44:34,506 --> 01:44:36,599
Like a whisper.

978
01:44:38,577 --> 01:44:44,573
So I took it, clicked it,
and this tiny ball of light appeared.

979
01:44:45,050 --> 01:44:46,483
And I knew.

980
01:44:47,052 --> 01:44:51,682
And sure enough, it floated toward me,
the ball of light...

981
01:44:53,392 --> 01:44:57,590
...went right to my chest,
straight through me. Right here.

982
01:44:58,797 --> 01:45:02,790
And I knew it was gonna take me
where I needed to go, so I Disapparated...

983
01:45:02,968 --> 01:45:05,232
...and came to this hillside.

984
01:45:05,771 --> 01:45:08,296
It was dark. I had no idea where I was.

985
01:45:08,841 --> 01:45:11,674
I just hoped
that one of you would show yourself.

986
01:45:12,578 --> 01:45:14,102
And you did.

987
01:45:31,530 --> 01:45:34,431
I've always liked these flames
Hermione makes.

988
01:45:38,470 --> 01:45:41,030
How long do you reckon
she'll stay mad at me?

989
01:45:42,574 --> 01:45:45,907
Well, just keep talking about that
little ball of light touching your heart...

990
01:45:46,078 --> 01:45:47,511
...and she'll come round.

991
01:45:47,680 --> 01:45:50,410
It was true. Every word.

992
01:45:52,217 --> 01:45:54,583
This is gonna sound crazy...

993
01:45:55,054 --> 01:45:59,423
...but I think that's why Dumbledore
left it to me, the Deluminator.

994
01:45:59,925 --> 01:46:04,919
I think he knew that somehow I'd need it
to find my way back, and she'd lead me.

995
01:46:07,800 --> 01:46:10,530
Bloody hell, I just realized,
you need a wand, don't you?

996
01:46:10,703 --> 01:46:13,194
- Yeah.
- I've got one here.

997
01:46:13,472 --> 01:46:16,066
It's a blackthorn. Ten inches.

998
01:46:16,241 --> 01:46:19,836
Nothing special, but I reckon it'll do.

999
01:46:20,279 --> 01:46:23,077
Took if off a Snatcher
a couple of weeks ago.

1000
01:46:23,582 --> 01:46:27,416
Don't tell Hermione this,
but they're a bit dim, Snatchers.

1001
01:46:27,686 --> 01:46:30,621
This one was definitely part troll,
the smell of him.

1002
01:46:30,789 --> 01:46:31,813
<i>Engorgio.</i>

1003
01:46:31,991 --> 01:46:34,152
<i>- Reducio!
What's going on in there?</i>

1004
01:46:34,326 --> 01:46:35,588
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

1005
01:46:37,963 --> 01:46:39,590
We need to talk.

1006
01:46:40,399 --> 01:46:41,593
Yeah, all right.

1007
01:46:48,574 --> 01:46:52,101
- I want to go see Xenophilius Lovegood.
- Sorry?

1008
01:46:53,879 --> 01:46:55,506
See this?

1009
01:46:55,681 --> 01:46:59,549
It's a letter Dumbledore wrote
to Grindelwald. Look at the signature.

1010
01:47:00,786 --> 01:47:02,981
It's the mark again.

1011
01:47:03,922 --> 01:47:06,049
It keeps cropping up.

1012
01:47:06,225 --> 01:47:10,594
<i>In Beedle the Bard,
in the graveyard in Godric's Hollow.</i>

1013
01:47:11,430 --> 01:47:13,295
It was there too.

1014
01:47:13,465 --> 01:47:17,060
- Where?
- Outside Gregorovitch's Wand Shop.

1015
01:47:17,503 --> 01:47:18,731
But what does it mean?

1016
01:47:18,904 --> 01:47:23,705
Look, you've got no idea where
the next Horcrux is, and neither do I...

1017
01:47:25,411 --> 01:47:28,346
...but this, this means something.

1018
01:47:28,680 --> 01:47:32,081
- I'm sure of it.
- Yeah. Hermione's right.

1019
01:47:33,118 --> 01:47:35,211
We ought to see Lovegood.

1020
01:47:35,721 --> 01:47:39,452
Let's vote on it. Those in favor?

1021
01:48:03,282 --> 01:48:05,910
You're not still mad at him, are you?

1022
01:48:06,218 --> 01:48:08,482
I'm always mad at him.

1023
01:48:11,256 --> 01:48:12,746
Luna.

1024
01:48:12,925 --> 01:48:14,620
Luna.

1025
01:48:22,301 --> 01:48:25,134
"Keep off the dirigible plums."

1026
01:48:34,179 --> 01:48:36,875
What is it? Who are you?

1027
01:48:37,182 --> 01:48:38,206
What do you want?

1028
01:48:38,383 --> 01:48:42,979
Hello, Mr. Lovegood. I'm Harry Potter.
We met a few months ago.

1029
01:48:46,992 --> 01:48:48,892
Could we come in?

1030
01:48:52,664 --> 01:48:55,258
- Where is Luna?
- Luna?

1031
01:48:56,535 --> 01:48:58,503
She'll be along.

1032
01:49:12,017 --> 01:49:14,076
So how can I help you, Mr. Potter?

1033
01:49:14,920 --> 01:49:17,946
Well, actually....

1034
01:49:18,957 --> 01:49:23,485
It was about something you were wearing
round your neck at the wedding. A symbol.

1035
01:49:25,030 --> 01:49:26,930
You mean this?

1036
01:49:27,332 --> 01:49:28,924
Yes.

1037
01:49:29,234 --> 01:49:31,099
That exactly.

1038
01:49:31,770 --> 01:49:35,729
What we've wondered is, what is it?

1039
01:49:35,908 --> 01:49:37,739
What is it?

1040
01:49:37,910 --> 01:49:40,879
Well, it's the sign of the Deathly Hallows,
of course.

1041
01:49:41,046 --> 01:49:42,138
- The what?
- The what?

1042
01:49:42,314 --> 01:49:44,373
The Deathly Hallows.

1043
01:49:44,550 --> 01:49:47,644
I assume you're all familiar with
"The Tale of the Three Brothers."

1044
01:49:47,819 --> 01:49:49,309
- Yes.
- No.

1045
01:49:54,660 --> 01:49:56,423
I have it in here.

1046
01:50:07,673 --> 01:50:09,300
"There were once three brothers...

1047
01:50:09,474 --> 01:50:13,877
...who were traveling along a lonely,
winding road at twilight."

1048
01:50:14,046 --> 01:50:16,776
Midnight. Mom always said "midnight."

1049
01:50:21,787 --> 01:50:25,655
But "twilight's" fine. Better, actually.

1050
01:50:27,926 --> 01:50:29,791
Do you want to read it?

1051
01:50:29,962 --> 01:50:32,157
No. It's fine.

1052
01:50:34,066 --> 01:50:36,000
<i>"There were once three brothers...</i>

1053
01:50:36,168 --> 01:50:41,367
<i>...who were traveling along a lonely,
winding road at twilight.</i>

1054
01:50:43,242 --> 01:50:48,544
<i>In time, the brothers reached a river
too treacherous to pass.</i>

1055
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:50,745
But being learned in the magical arts...</i>

1056
01:50:50,916 --> 01:50:56,081
<i>...the three brothers simply
waved their wands and made a bridge.</i>

1057
01:50:57,422 --> 01:50:59,515
Before they could cross, however...</i>

1058
01:50:59,691 --> 01:51:03,787
<i>...they found their path blocked
by a hooded figure.</i>

1059
01:51:04,062 --> 01:51:07,930
<i>It was Death, and he felt cheated.</i>

1060
01:51:08,100 --> 01:51:11,160
<i>Cheated because travelers would
normally drown in the river.</i>

1061
01:51:11,336 --> 01:51:13,395
<i>But Death was cunning.</i>

1062
01:51:14,039 --> 01:51:17,031
<i>He pretended to congratulate
the three brothers on their magic...</i>

1063
01:51:17,209 --> 01:51:22,476
<i>...and said that each had earned a prize for
having been clever enough to evade him.</i>

1064
01:51:23,048 --> 01:51:27,610
<i>The oldest asked for a wand
more powerful than any in existence.</i>

1065
01:51:27,786 --> 01:51:32,382
<i>So Death fashioned him one
from an elder tree that stood nearby.</i>

1066
01:51:33,792 --> 01:51:38,092
<i>The second brother decided he wanted
to humiliate Death even further...</i>

1067
01:51:38,263 --> 01:51:42,700
<i>...and asked for the power
to recall loved ones from the grave.</i>

1068
01:51:43,135 --> 01:51:47,435
<i>So Death plucked a stone from the river
and offered it to him.</i>

1069
01:51:48,173 --> 01:51:52,132
<i>Finally,
Death turned to the third brother.</i>

1070
01:51:53,345 --> 01:51:54,778
<i>A humble man...</i>

1071
01:51:54,946 --> 01:51:59,144
<i>...he asked for something that would
allow him to go forth from that place...</i>

1072
01:51:59,318 --> 01:52:02,481
<i>...without being followed by Death.</i>

1073
01:52:03,588 --> 01:52:09,458
<i>And so it was that Death reluctantly
handed over his own Cloak of Invisibility.</i>

1074
01:52:12,831 --> 01:52:15,766
<i>The first brother traveled
to a distant village...</i>

1075
01:52:15,934 --> 01:52:18,027
<i>...where, with the Elder Wand in hand...</i>

1076
01:52:18,203 --> 01:52:21,969
<i>...he killed a wizard
with whom he had once quarreled.</i>

1077
01:52:24,176 --> 01:52:27,703
<i>Drunk with the power
that the Elder Wand had given him...</i>

1078
01:52:27,879 --> 01:52:30,973
<i>...he bragged of his invincibility.</i>

1079
01:52:33,985 --> 01:52:37,443
<i>But that night,
another wizard stole the wand...</i>

1080
01:52:37,622 --> 01:52:40,750
<i>...and slit the brother's throat
for good measure.</i>

1081
01:52:40,959 --> 01:52:44,395
And so Death took the first brother
for his own.</i>

1082
01:52:45,130 --> 01:52:47,098
<i>The second brother journeyed
to his home...</i>

1083
01:52:47,265 --> 01:52:50,234
<i>...where he took the stone
and turned it thrice in hand.</i>

1084
01:52:50,402 --> 01:52:54,862
<i>To his delight, the girl he'd once hoped
to marry before her untimely death...</i>

1085
01:52:55,040 --> 01:52:57,406
<i>...appeared before him.</i>

1086
01:52:57,909 --> 01:53:03,211
<i>Yet, soon she turned sad and cold
for she did not belong in the mortal world.</i>

1087
01:53:03,382 --> 01:53:05,009
<i>Driven mad with hopeless longing...</i>

1088
01:53:05,183 --> 01:53:08,482
<i>...the second brother killed himself
so as to join her.</i>

1089
01:53:09,688 --> 01:53:12,782
<i>And so Death took the second brother.</i>

1090
01:53:12,958 --> 01:53:14,585
<i>As for the third brother...</i>

1091
01:53:14,760 --> 01:53:18,992
<i>...Death searched for many years
but was never able to find him.</i>

1092
01:53:19,164 --> 01:53:22,065
<i>Only when he attained a great age
did the youngest brother...</i>

1093
01:53:22,234 --> 01:53:26,500
<i>...shed the Cloak of Invisibility
and give it to his son.</i>

1094
01:53:27,739 --> 01:53:31,869
<i>He then greeted Death as an old friend
and went with him gladly...</i>

1095
01:53:32,043 --> 01:53:35,206
<i>...departing this life as equals."</i>

1096
01:53:37,282 --> 01:53:41,776
So there you are.
Those are the Deathly Hallows.

1097
01:53:43,188 --> 01:53:46,248
I'm sorry, sir.
I still don't quite understand.

1098
01:53:51,863 --> 01:53:53,956
Where's that pen I had?

1099
01:54:04,943 --> 01:54:06,205
The Elder Wand.

1100
01:54:07,345 --> 01:54:11,008
The most powerful wand ever made.

1101
01:54:21,393 --> 01:54:23,691
The Resurrection Stone.

1102
01:54:34,573 --> 01:54:38,339
The Cloak of Invisibility.

1103
01:54:40,378 --> 01:54:43,506
Together, they make the Deathly Hallows.

1104
01:54:43,782 --> 01:54:49,243
Together, they make one
master of Death.

1105
01:54:54,459 --> 01:54:58,122
That mark was on a grave
in Godric's Hollow.

1106
01:54:59,231 --> 01:55:01,859
Uh, Mr. Lovegood,
does the Peverell Family...

1107
01:55:02,033 --> 01:55:03,864
...have anything to do
with the Deathly Hallows?

1108
01:55:04,035 --> 01:55:06,868
Uh-- Uh--

1109
01:55:07,038 --> 01:55:10,804
Ignotus-- Excuse me. --and his brothers,
Cadmus and Antioch...

1110
01:55:10,976 --> 01:55:13,638
...are thought to be the original owners
of the Hallows...

1111
01:55:13,812 --> 01:55:18,681
...and therefore the inspiration
for the story. Uh-- Uh--

1112
01:55:18,850 --> 01:55:21,341
But your tea's gone cold.

1113
01:55:22,554 --> 01:55:24,545
I'll be right back.

1114
01:55:24,723 --> 01:55:26,588
Let's go down here.

1115
01:55:28,460 --> 01:55:29,950
Let's get out of here.

1116
01:55:30,128 --> 01:55:32,995
I'm not drinking any more of that stuff,
hot or cold.

1117
01:55:39,304 --> 01:55:41,272
Thank you, sir.

1118
01:55:42,173 --> 01:55:45,199
- You forgot the water.
- Water?

1119
01:55:45,377 --> 01:55:46,810
For the tea.

1120
01:55:46,978 --> 01:55:49,538
Did--? Did I?

1121
01:55:51,483 --> 01:55:53,644
How silly of me.

1122
01:55:55,253 --> 01:55:57,517
It's no matter.
We really should be going anyway.

1123
01:55:57,689 --> 01:55:59,748
No, you can't!

1124
01:56:03,962 --> 01:56:05,657
Sir?

1125
01:56:13,038 --> 01:56:15,632
You're my only hope.

1126
01:56:19,511 --> 01:56:23,880
They were angry, you see,
about what I'd been writing.

1127
01:56:26,918 --> 01:56:29,045
So they took her.

1128
01:56:30,522 --> 01:56:33,286
They took my Luna.

1129
01:56:34,993 --> 01:56:36,620
My Luna.

1130
01:56:49,107 --> 01:56:52,008
But it's really you they want.

1131
01:56:54,245 --> 01:56:56,304
Who took her, sir?

1132
01:57:01,453 --> 01:57:02,715
Voldemort.

1133
01:57:13,365 --> 01:57:15,663
Stop! I've got him!

1134
01:57:32,951 --> 01:57:36,853
That treacherous little bleeder.
Is there no one we can trust?

1135
01:57:37,022 --> 01:57:39,320
They kidnapped her
because he supported me.

1136
01:57:39,491 --> 01:57:41,618
He was just desperate.

1137
01:57:42,160 --> 01:57:44,355
I'll do the enchantments.

1138
01:57:56,041 --> 01:57:57,474
Hello, beautiful.

1139
01:58:02,947 --> 01:58:06,576
Well, don't hang about, snatch them.

1140
01:59:17,822 --> 01:59:19,312
<i>Harry.</i>

1141
01:59:19,491 --> 01:59:22,460
<i>Tell me, Grindelwald.
Tell me where it is.</i>

1142
01:59:23,061 --> 01:59:27,122
<i>Grindelwald. Grindelwald. Grindelwald.</i>

1143
01:59:27,866 --> 01:59:31,324
Hello, Tom.
I knew you would come one day...

1144
01:59:31,803 --> 01:59:35,762
...but surely you must know
I no longer have what you seek.

1145
01:59:36,407 --> 01:59:39,433
- Tell me, Grindelwald. Tell me where it is.
- Ha-ha-ha.

1146
01:59:39,611 --> 01:59:40,976
Tell me who possesses it.

1147
01:59:41,179 --> 01:59:46,276
The Elder Wand lies with him,
of course...

1148
01:59:46,451 --> 01:59:48,715
...buried in the earth.

1149
01:59:49,654 --> 01:59:50,985
Dumbledore.

1150
02:00:00,031 --> 02:00:01,896
The Hallows exist...

1151
02:00:02,066 --> 02:00:05,866
...but he's only after one of them,
the last one. He knows where it is.

1152
02:00:06,037 --> 02:00:09,871
He's gonna have it by the end of the night.
You-Know-Who's found the Elder Wand.

1153
02:00:10,041 --> 02:00:12,509
- Don't touch her. Unh!
- Leave him.

1154
02:00:12,677 --> 02:00:13,939
Your boyfriend will get worse than that...

1155
02:00:14,112 --> 02:00:15,238
Get off me.

1156
02:00:15,413 --> 02:00:18,143
...if he doesn't learn to behave himself.

1157
02:00:21,386 --> 02:00:22,876
What happened to you, ugly?

1158
02:00:24,589 --> 02:00:26,454
No, not you.

1159
02:00:27,859 --> 02:00:30,919
- What's your name?
- Dudley. Vernon Dudley.

1160
02:00:31,095 --> 02:00:33,290
Check it.

1161
02:00:34,899 --> 02:00:37,231
And you, my lovely...

1162
02:00:40,538 --> 02:00:42,529
...what do they call you?

1163
02:00:43,975 --> 02:00:48,036
Penelope Clearwater, half-blood.

1164
02:00:51,149 --> 02:00:53,083
There's no Vernon Dudley on here.

1165
02:00:54,152 --> 02:00:57,383
Did you hear that, ugly?
The list says you're lying.

1166
02:00:57,555 --> 02:00:59,785
How come you don't want us
to know who you are?

1167
02:00:59,958 --> 02:01:02,620
The list's wrong. I told you who I am.

1168
02:01:18,576 --> 02:01:20,669
Change of plan.

1169
02:01:21,746 --> 02:01:25,011
We're not taking this lot to the Ministry.

1170
02:02:04,689 --> 02:02:08,318
Get Draco.

1171
02:02:12,797 --> 02:02:14,355
Well?

1172
02:02:17,468 --> 02:02:21,996
- I can't be sure.
- Draco. Look closely, son.

1173
02:02:23,007 --> 02:02:28,070
If we are the ones
to hand Potter over to the Dark Lord...

1174
02:02:28,246 --> 02:02:33,479
...everything would be forgiven.
All would be as it was, you understand?

1175
02:02:33,651 --> 02:02:37,781
Now, we won't be forgetting who
actually caught him, I hope, Mr. Malfoy.

1176
02:02:37,956 --> 02:02:40,390
You dare to
talk to me like that in my own house?

1177
02:02:40,558 --> 02:02:42,355
Lucius.

1178
02:02:45,263 --> 02:02:49,097
Don't be shy, sweetie. Come over.

1179
02:02:50,601 --> 02:02:55,368
Now, if this isn't who we think it is, Draco,
and we call him, he'll kill us all.

1180
02:02:55,540 --> 02:02:58,338
We need to be absolutely sure.

1181
02:02:58,643 --> 02:02:59,632
What's wrong with his face?

1182
02:02:59,811 --> 02:03:01,540
Yes, what is wrong with his face?

1183
02:03:01,713 --> 02:03:02,907
He came to us like that.

1184
02:03:03,081 --> 02:03:05,049
Something he picked up in the forest,
I reckon.

1185
02:03:05,216 --> 02:03:08,913
Or ran into a Stinging Jinx.
Was it you, dearie?

1186
02:03:14,025 --> 02:03:16,789
Give me her wand.
We'll see what her last spell was.

1187
02:03:18,062 --> 02:03:20,223
Ah. Got you.

1188
02:03:24,035 --> 02:03:25,764
What is that?

1189
02:03:27,705 --> 02:03:29,297
Where'd you get that from?

1190
02:03:29,474 --> 02:03:32,966
It was in her bag when we searched her.
Reckon it's mine now.

1191
02:03:36,714 --> 02:03:38,045
Are you mad?

1192
02:03:46,357 --> 02:03:49,190
Go! Get out!

1193
02:03:54,832 --> 02:03:58,996
Cissy, put the boys in the cellar.

1194
02:03:59,170 --> 02:04:04,540
I want to have a little conversation
with this one, girl-to-girl.

1195
02:04:13,584 --> 02:04:16,678
What are we gonna do?
We can't leave Hermione alone with her.

1196
02:04:16,854 --> 02:04:18,219
Ron?

1197
02:04:23,428 --> 02:04:24,986
Harry?

1198
02:04:30,701 --> 02:04:32,259
Luna?

1199
02:04:32,870 --> 02:04:37,034
That sword is meant to be in my vault
at Gringotts. How did you get it?

1200
02:04:37,208 --> 02:04:40,336
What else did you and your friends take
from my vault?!

1201
02:04:40,511 --> 02:04:45,881
I didn't take anything. Please.
I didn't take anything.

1202
02:04:46,050 --> 02:04:47,574
I don't believe it.

1203
02:04:53,157 --> 02:04:54,249
We have to do something.

1204
02:04:54,425 --> 02:04:58,452
There's no way out of here.
We've tried everything. It's enchanted.

1205
02:04:58,629 --> 02:05:01,325
- Please! please!
- Shut up!

1206
02:05:01,499 --> 02:05:03,296
You're bleeding, Harry.

1207
02:05:03,468 --> 02:05:05,493
That's a curious thing
to keep in your sock.

1208
02:05:14,745 --> 02:05:15,871
Help us.

1209
02:05:21,652 --> 02:05:23,552
- Let her go.
- Shut up. Get back.

1210
02:05:24,889 --> 02:05:29,087
You, goblin, come with me.

1211
02:05:48,746 --> 02:05:50,236
- Aah!
- Dobby?

1212
02:05:51,115 --> 02:05:52,514
What are you doing here?

1213
02:05:52,683 --> 02:05:54,947
Dobby has come to rescue
Harry Potter, of course.

1214
02:05:55,119 --> 02:05:57,587
Dobby will always be there
for Harry Potter.

1215
02:05:57,755 --> 02:06:01,350
You can Apparate in and out of this room?
Could you take us with you?

1216
02:06:01,526 --> 02:06:03,289
Of course, sir. I'm an elf.

1217
02:06:04,095 --> 02:06:05,960
Works for me.

1218
02:06:06,197 --> 02:06:08,563
Dobby, I want you to take Luna
and Mr. Ollivander--

1219
02:06:08,733 --> 02:06:11,167
Shell Cottage
on the outskirts of Tinworth.

1220
02:06:11,536 --> 02:06:12,560
Trust me.

1221
02:06:13,371 --> 02:06:14,804
Whenever you're ready, sir.

1222
02:06:15,506 --> 02:06:18,202
Sir? I like her very much.

1223
02:06:23,147 --> 02:06:26,446
Meet me at the top of the stairs
in 10 seconds.

1224
02:06:35,526 --> 02:06:37,289
Ow.

1225
02:06:42,700 --> 02:06:44,930
Who gets his wand?

1226
02:06:47,672 --> 02:06:51,665
I'm only going to
ask you once more, goblin.

1227
02:06:51,842 --> 02:06:55,243
Think very, very carefully
before you answer.

1228
02:06:55,613 --> 02:06:57,171
I don't know.

1229
02:06:57,348 --> 02:07:00,545
You don't know?
Why weren't you doing your job?

1230
02:07:00,718 --> 02:07:03,949
Who got into my vault?

1231
02:07:05,223 --> 02:07:09,660
Who stole it? Who stole it? Well?

1232
02:07:09,827 --> 02:07:13,854
When I was last in your vault,
the sword was there.

1233
02:07:16,634 --> 02:07:19,831
Oh, well then, perhaps
it just walked out on its own then.

1234
02:07:20,004 --> 02:07:22,438
There is no place safer than Gringotts.

1235
02:07:22,607 --> 02:07:24,040
Liar!

1236
02:07:25,977 --> 02:07:29,378
Consider yourself lucky, goblin.

1237
02:07:31,816 --> 02:07:35,217
The same won't be said for this one.

1238
02:07:35,386 --> 02:07:37,149
Like hell.

1239
02:07:37,888 --> 02:07:39,116
<i>Expellliarmus!</i>

1240
02:07:40,558 --> 02:07:41,650
<i>Stupefy.</i>

1241
02:07:45,796 --> 02:07:47,161
Stop!

1242
02:07:48,332 --> 02:07:49,890
Drop your wands.

1243
02:07:52,770 --> 02:07:53,794
I said, drop them!

1244
02:07:55,306 --> 02:07:56,739
Pick them up, Draco, now.

1245
02:07:57,608 --> 02:08:01,738
Well, well, well,
look what we have here.

1246
02:08:03,347 --> 02:08:04,837
It's Harry Potter.

1247
02:08:05,616 --> 02:08:11,987
He's all bright and shiny and new again,
just in time for the Dark Lord.

1248
02:08:12,156 --> 02:08:14,181
Call him.

1249
02:08:17,928 --> 02:08:19,725
Call him.

1250
02:08:54,932 --> 02:08:56,763
<i>Stupefy!</i>

1251
02:08:57,535 --> 02:08:59,230
Stupid elf.

1252
02:08:59,403 --> 02:09:02,429
- You could've killed me.
- Dobby never meant to kill.

1253
02:09:02,606 --> 02:09:06,633
Dobby only meant to maim
or seriously injure.

1254
02:09:08,946 --> 02:09:12,279
How dare you take a witch's wand?

1255
02:09:12,450 --> 02:09:15,442
How dare you defy your masters?

1256
02:09:15,619 --> 02:09:18,747
Dobby has no master.

1257
02:09:18,923 --> 02:09:21,414
Dobby is a free elf.

1258
02:09:21,592 --> 02:09:26,552
And Dobby has come
to save Harry Potter and his friends.

1259
02:09:56,394 --> 02:09:58,055
Hermione.

1260
02:09:58,229 --> 02:10:00,720
You're all right. We're safe.

1261
02:10:00,898 --> 02:10:02,923
We're all safe.

1262
02:10:03,801 --> 02:10:05,996
Harry Potter.

1263
02:10:09,740 --> 02:10:11,571
Dobby.

1264
02:10:22,086 --> 02:10:25,146
Dobby. No, just-- Hold on.

1265
02:10:25,322 --> 02:10:29,656
Hold on. Look, just hold on, okay?

1266
02:10:29,827 --> 02:10:31,886
We'll fix you.

1267
02:10:32,329 --> 02:10:35,059
Hermione will have something.

1268
02:10:35,232 --> 02:10:37,564
In your bag. Hermione?

1269
02:10:39,203 --> 02:10:40,534
Hermione?

1270
02:10:42,740 --> 02:10:45,868
What is it? Help me.

1271
02:10:48,446 --> 02:10:51,574
Such a beautiful place...

1272
02:10:53,751 --> 02:10:56,015
...to be with friends.

1273
02:10:57,822 --> 02:11:03,226
Dobby is happy to be with his friend...

1274
02:11:05,629 --> 02:11:08,063
...Harry Potter.

1275
02:11:28,853 --> 02:11:31,253
We should close his eyes.

1276
02:11:31,489 --> 02:11:33,514
Don't you think?

1277
02:11:38,629 --> 02:11:40,028
There.

1278
02:11:40,498 --> 02:11:42,932
Now he could be sleeping.

1279
02:11:58,249 --> 02:12:00,308
I want to bury him.

1280
02:12:01,352 --> 02:12:04,913
Properly. Without magic.
