<i>about last week's attack

<i>An anonymous source
provided this video.</i>

5

<i>It shows Quentin Beck,
aka Mysterio,</i>

6

<i>moments before his death.</i>

7

<i>You may find
this video disturbing.</i>

8
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:18,185
<i>I managed to
send the Elemental back,</i>

9
00:00:18,318 --> 00:00:20,454
<i>but I don't think I'm gonna
make it off this bridge.</i>

10
00:00:20,588 --> 00:00:22,122
<i>Spider-Man attacked me.</i>

11
00:00:22,256 --> 00:00:24,491
<i>He has an army of drones,
Stark technology.</i>

12
00:00:24,626 --> 00:00:28,095
<i>He's saying he's gonna be
the new Iron Man. No one else.</i>

<i>Are you sure you want
to commence the drone attack?</i>

14

<i>There will be
significant casualties.</i>

15
00:00:32,534 --> 00:00:34,401
<i>Do it. Execute them all.</i>

16
00:00:38,706 --> 00:00:41,776
<i>This shocking video
was released earlier today</i>

news website TheDailyBugle.net.</i>

18

<i>There you have it, folks.
Conclusive proof</i>

19
00:00:46,948 --> 00:00:48,950
<i>that Spider-Man was responsible</i>

20
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:51,218
<i>for the brutal murder
of Mysterio,</i>

21
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:52,787
<i>an interdimensional warrior</i>

22
00:00:52,921 --> 00:00:54,689
<i>who gave his life
to protect our planet</i>

23
00:00:54,822 --> 00:00:57,190
<i>and who will, no doubt,
go down in history</i>

24

<i>as the greatest superhero
of all time.</i>

25
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:02,496
<i>But that's not all, folks.</i>

26
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:04,164
<i>Here's the real blockbuster.</i>

27

<i>Brace yourselves.
You might wanna sit down.</i>

28

<i>Spider-Man's real...
Spider-Man's real name is...</i>

<i>Spider-Man's name
is Peter Parker.</i>

30
00:01:14,642 --> 00:01:16,143
What the f...?

31
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:18,713
<i>That's right, folks.
Peter Parker.</i>

32
00:01:18,846 --> 00:01:21,583
<i>A 17-year-old
high school delinquent...</i>

33

- She knows him.
- Are you Spider-Man's girlfriend?

34
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:25,385
<i>...is, in fact...</i>

35
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,087
Are you Spider-Man's
girlfriend?

36
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,156
<i>...the vile vigilante villain
Spider-Man.</i>

37
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:31,291
- Yo, it's him.
- Uh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

38
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:33,460
- Please don't touch her, sir.
- You're just a kid?

39
00:01:33,595 --> 00:01:35,162
- You murdered Mysterio?
- Um...

40
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:36,664
- You helped him?
- No, I didn't...

41
00:01:36,798 --> 00:01:38,833
Come on, kid,
let me see your face.

42
00:01:38,967 --> 00:01:40,300
He hit me.
Spider-Man hit me!

43
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:41,970
- Come on.
- He hit me.

44
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:43,972
<i>All this time,
people looked up to this boy</i>

45
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,807
<i>and called him a hero.</i>

46
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:49,242
<i>I'll tell you what I call him,
public enemy number one!</i>

47
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:52,080
I told you I never wanted
to do this ever again!

48
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:54,015
MJ, I'm so sorry,
but I can't see anything

49
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:55,215
with your hand in my...

50
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:56,618
Sorry. Where are we
gonna go?

51
00:01:56,751 --> 00:01:58,519
- I don't know. Your house?
- No! No!

52
00:01:58,653 --> 00:02:00,120
My dad will kill you.

53
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:02,023
What? You said
your dad really liked me.

54
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:03,925
Yeah, well, not anymore.

55
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,696
<i>Dude!</i>

56
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:09,764
Dude!

57
00:02:09,897 --> 00:02:11,032
<i>Dude!</i>

58
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:12,100
Dude!

59
00:02:13,668 --> 00:02:14,902
I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?

60
00:02:15,036 --> 00:02:16,336
No, not really. Uh...

61
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,905
Yo, Peter!

62
00:02:25,546 --> 00:02:27,147
We should go.
We should go. Come on.

63
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,717
- You said you don't want to swing.
- Swing me.

64
00:02:29,851 --> 00:02:31,451
Okay. We can take the subway.

65
00:02:35,089 --> 00:02:36,124
No.

66
00:02:42,096 --> 00:02:43,131
Look out!

67
00:02:51,773 --> 00:02:53,141
That was so much worse.

68
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:54,341
Okay. It's okay.

69
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:57,411
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

70
00:02:57,545 --> 00:03:00,480
Come on, come on, come on.
Okay, I'm so sorry.

71
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

72
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:13,061
Okay. Okay.

73
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,227
I'm sorry.

74
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:18,966
I just feel so dumb. I didn't
realize you were miserable.

75
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,768
No, it was really fun, right?

76
00:03:20,902 --> 00:03:22,436
That's why they call it
a fling.

77
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:24,005
- And we flung.
- It was fun.

78
00:03:24,138 --> 00:03:25,506
I could've been more fun.

79
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,974
- I can be fun.
- We'll hang out again.

80
00:03:27,108 --> 00:03:29,143
Like, when do you think?

81
00:03:31,646 --> 00:03:32,780
I should see what that is.

82
00:03:32,914 --> 00:03:34,782
- No, no, no.
- It's what I do.

83
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:36,918
- He's always coming and going.
- Peter?

84
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:39,486
Oh, no.

85
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,989
- I don't know what to do.
- Peter. Peter.

86
00:03:42,123 --> 00:03:44,092
- Oh, I...
- I didn't see anything.

87
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,459
This isn't what
it looks like.

88
00:03:45,593 --> 00:03:47,260
- No, no, May.
- Practice safe...

89
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:50,098
Oh, hey. You must be MJ!

90
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,700
- Yeah. Nice to meet you.
- So nice to meet you.

91
00:03:52,834 --> 00:03:54,669
Wait, have you
been crying?

92
00:03:54,802 --> 00:03:55,903
We broke up.

93
00:03:57,538 --> 00:03:59,306
- Hey, Spider-Man!
- Oh. Oh, uh...

94
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:02,176
Thank you. I didn't know
you broke up.

95
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:03,578
I thought you were
in love, May.

96
00:04:03,711 --> 00:04:05,213
Can we talk about this
in the kitchen?

97
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:06,848
I should probably leave.

98
00:04:06,981 --> 00:04:08,883
I thought you guys
were such a handsome couple.

99
00:04:09,016 --> 00:04:11,052
It's really about boundaries.

100
00:04:11,185 --> 00:04:13,453
- Let me answer the door.
- Let's go here.

101
00:04:13,588 --> 00:04:15,022
- Is that the door?
- Hey. Is it true?

102
00:04:15,156 --> 00:04:17,058
- I was gonna go, but...
- Not now.

103
00:04:17,191 --> 00:04:20,128
I didn't know you were
so awkward about sex, Peter.

104
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,196
This has nothing to do
with sex.

105
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:25,666
If you wanna go over it again.
I mean... What's that sound?

106
00:04:27,001 --> 00:04:29,402
- Hey, Spider-Man!
- Oh, my God.

107
00:04:29,537 --> 00:04:32,439
I mean, I'm happy to rehash it
if you want to.

108
00:04:32,573 --> 00:04:35,176
You take care of your
side, I'll take care of mine.

109
00:04:37,645 --> 00:04:39,046
What is up
with this phone?

110
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,048
Will you get off your phones
for five minutes?

111
00:04:41,182 --> 00:04:43,416
I just wanna talk to you
about your relationship, okay?

112
00:04:43,551 --> 00:04:44,519
Peter?

113
00:04:47,622 --> 00:04:48,556
What?

114
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,593
- Is that...?
- Is that here?

115
00:04:52,727 --> 00:04:54,128
Um...

116
00:05:06,908 --> 00:05:09,177
- Yo, Peter Parker!
- Yo, Peter!

117
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,212
Maybe it's not
such a big deal.

Get in here, guys. Let's go.

141
00:06:01,762 --> 00:06:03,865
I didn't kill Quentin Beck.
The drones did, okay?

142
00:06:03,998 --> 00:06:05,800
- The drones that are yours.
- No.

143
00:06:05,933 --> 00:06:08,169
Well, look. Nick Fury was there
the entire time.

Ask him.
He can explain everything.

148

Don't say anything
without a lawyer.

149
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:22,482
I want a lawyer.

150

- Ms. Jones-Watson.
- Jones. I don't go by Watson.

151
00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:27,855
Ms. Jones, why do you
want a lawyer if...?

152
00:06:27,989 --> 00:06:29,190
If I have nothing to hide?

153
00:06:29,323 --> 00:06:30,691
Exactly. Unless...

154
00:06:30,825 --> 00:06:32,627
- I'm actually guilty of something?
- Mm-hm.

155

I'm very aware of your tactics

00:06:37,365 --> 00:06:39,033
I've seen your file.

158
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:40,368
You're a smart young woman

159
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:42,536
with a bright future
ahead of her.

160
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,171
Why would you risk it all

161
00:06:44,305 --> 00:06:47,440
by getting involved with
a vigilante like Peter Parker?

162
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:50,544
So sorry to keep you waiting.

163
00:06:50,678 --> 00:06:52,179
- Can we get Ned a snack?
- Absolutely.

164
00:06:52,313 --> 00:06:53,648
- He's been waiting.
- I got you.

165
00:06:53,781 --> 00:06:55,850
Dude, I'm so sorry about that.

166
00:06:55,983 --> 00:06:58,052
I'm not supposed
to say anything to you.

167
00:06:58,185 --> 00:07:00,187
Not even a thing.
I just have one question.

168
00:07:00,321 --> 00:07:02,590
When MJ told you
Peter was Spider-Man...

169
00:07:02,723 --> 00:07:04,424
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Heh.
- What's up?

170
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:05,927
I-I knew way before MJ did.

171
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,395
I was Spider-Man's
"guy in the chair."

172
00:07:07,528 --> 00:07:08,729
I know about those.

173
00:07:08,863 --> 00:07:10,531
Dude, half my guys
are guys in the chair.

174
00:07:10,665 --> 00:07:11,933
Exactly. You would know.

175
00:07:12,066 --> 00:07:14,302
I literally helped him
find the Vulture.

176
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,704
- I didn't know that.
- I helped him hack a suit once

177
00:07:16,837 --> 00:07:18,239
and helped him get to space.

178
00:07:18,372 --> 00:07:20,741
So in Spider-Man's
illegal vigilantism,

179
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:22,877
you were his main accomplice.

180
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:28,516
I would like to have my words
stricken from the record.

181
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:32,153
With all due respect, and
I mean that very insincerely,

182
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:35,289
unless you have some real
specific charges to throw at us,

183
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:38,059
legally, you can't hold us here.

184
00:07:38,192 --> 00:07:40,528
- You should definitely lawyer up.
- Excuse me?

185
00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:42,730
Child endangerment's
a nasty rap.

186
00:07:42,863 --> 00:07:44,598
A boy was entrusted to you,

187
00:07:44,732 --> 00:07:47,068
and as his legal guardian,
essentially his mother,

188
00:07:47,201 --> 00:07:49,337
you not only allowed him
to endanger himself,

189
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,105
but you actually
encouraged it.

190
00:07:51,238 --> 00:07:52,873
Who does that?

191
00:07:53,007 --> 00:07:54,942
I wanna see Peter right now.

192
00:07:55,076 --> 00:07:57,778
<i>Stark
Industries was caught in the web</i>

193
00:07:57,912 --> 00:08:00,448
<i>of the Spider-Man-Mysterio
controversy today,</i>

194
00:08:00,581 --> 00:08:03,050

opened an investigation</i>

195
00:08:03,184 --> 00:08:05,886

<i>Agents wanna know

197
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:10,257
At least they used
a good picture.

198
00:08:10,391 --> 00:08:12,159
What is happening?

199
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:16,864
That's great. Thank you.

200
00:08:16,998 --> 00:08:18,566
Well, I have
some good news, Peter.

201
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:20,067
I don't believe
any of the charges

202
00:08:20,201 --> 00:08:22,036
- against you are gonna stick.
- Wait, seriously?

203
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:23,704
- I knew it.
- Nice.

204
00:08:23,838 --> 00:08:25,373
My God, Mr. Murdock, thank you.

205
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:27,141
- Thank you, Matt.
- That's amazing.

206
00:08:27,274 --> 00:08:28,309
- You're welcome.
- Perfect.

207
00:08:28,442 --> 00:08:30,478
- However, Mr. Hogan.
- Yes?

208
00:08:30,611 --> 00:08:33,781
The feds are investigating
that missing technology.

209
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:36,183
I understand your loyalty
to Mr. Stark and his legacy,

210
00:08:36,317 --> 00:08:37,651
but if you were involved...

211
00:08:37,785 --> 00:08:39,520
- If I was?
- I advise securing a lawyer.

212
00:08:39,653 --> 00:08:42,490
I need a lawyer because I'm...?
I thought he was...

213
00:08:42,623 --> 00:08:43,924
You said there's no charge.

214
00:08:44,058 --> 00:08:45,860
I could say
under advisement of counsel,

215
00:08:45,993 --> 00:08:48,029
I refuse to answer
the question respectfully

216
00:08:48,162 --> 00:08:50,131
because the answer
can incriminate me...

217
00:08:50,264 --> 00:08:52,633
It's in <i>Goodfellas.</i> What's the
thing they say in <i>Goodfellas?</i>

218
00:08:52,767 --> 00:08:54,435
I know that's what you think.
Calm down.

219
00:08:54,568 --> 00:08:55,970
Let's hear what
he has to say. Matt?

220
00:08:56,103 --> 00:08:58,706
You're gonna need
a really good lawyer.

221
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:00,808
You may have dodged
your legal troubles

222
00:09:00,941 --> 00:09:02,376
but things will get much worse.

223
00:09:02,511 --> 00:09:04,845
There is still
the court of public opinion.

224
00:09:07,081 --> 00:09:09,483
Murderer! Mysterio forever!

225
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:13,320
How did you just do that?

226
00:09:13,454 --> 00:09:15,256
I'm a really good lawyer.

227
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:19,693
We're gonna need
a safer place to live.

228
00:09:30,438 --> 00:09:32,106
Oh. Ah.

229
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:34,008
How do we...?
How do we...?

230
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:36,043
<i>Alarm system deactivated.</i>

231
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:41,582
It looks nice.
And this is safe.

232
00:09:44,819 --> 00:09:48,055
Welcome to the spiritual oasis.

233
00:09:48,189 --> 00:09:49,590
You like <i>Donkey Kong Jr.?</i>

234

<i>Nicky from Jersey
City, you're on the line.</i>

235
00:09:54,061 --> 00:09:56,697
<i>I'm not saying I don't
want to honor the Avengers,</i>

236
00:09:56,831 --> 00:09:59,066
<i>but, you know,
not doing it this way.</i>

237
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,734
<i>Putting the
Captain America shield</i>

238

<i>on the Statue of Liberty?</i>

239
00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:04,405
<i>Nah, that will look ridiculous.</i>

240
00:10:04,539 --> 00:10:06,508
<i>Leave the Statue
of Liberty alone.</i>

241
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,676
Oh, Happy.

242
00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:10,811
<i>Did you send in
your applications yet?</i>

243
00:10:10,945 --> 00:10:12,413
I just finished my MIT one.

244
00:10:12,547 --> 00:10:13,814
- <i>You?</i>
- Same.

245
00:10:13,948 --> 00:10:16,217
Can you imagine if
we both got in? And Ned?

246
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,852
Yeah, but we'd have
to get scholarships

247
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:19,386
so we could actually go.

248
00:10:19,521 --> 00:10:21,722
You got the scores
and the grades.

249
00:10:21,856 --> 00:10:23,257
<i>You think I'm being
too pragmatic.</i>

250
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,527
<i>No, no, no. Well...</i>

251
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:26,894
<i>Kind of. It's okay.</i>

252
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:28,563
It's one of my favorite
things about you.

253
00:10:28,696 --> 00:10:29,930
- Really?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

254
00:10:30,064 --> 00:10:31,899
What are your other
favorite things?

255
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:33,734
I love your
relentless optimism.

256
00:10:33,868 --> 00:10:35,903
I am a glass-half-full
kind of gal.

257
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:37,905
I really like how
you're a people person.

258
00:10:38,038 --> 00:10:40,307
I love people.
I love them so much.

259
00:10:40,441 --> 00:10:41,375
You like sports.

260
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:42,743
<i>I think the Mets are gonna</i>

261
00:10:42,877 --> 00:10:44,378
- <i>go all the way this year.</i>
- <i>Really?</i>

262
00:10:44,513 --> 00:10:45,946
What's that noise?

263
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,716
<i>Oh. It's Happy. Look.</i>

264
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:51,719
<i>Gave his room to May
so he's sleeping down here.</i>

265
00:10:55,524 --> 00:10:58,759
I have a weird question. Um...

266
00:10:58,893 --> 00:11:01,563
Does any part of you
feel relieved about all of this?

267
00:11:04,932 --> 00:11:08,570
Ever since I got bit
by that spider...

268
00:11:08,702 --> 00:11:12,940
I've only had one week
where my life has felt normal.

269
00:11:13,073 --> 00:11:15,309
Or kind of normal, I guess.

270
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:16,477
And...

271
00:11:17,778 --> 00:11:19,280
that was when
you found out.

272
00:11:19,413 --> 00:11:22,049
<i>Because then everyone
that was in my life</i>

273
00:11:22,183 --> 00:11:23,984
<i>that I wanted to know, knew.</i>

274
00:11:24,118 --> 00:11:25,119
<i>And it was perfect.</i>

275
00:11:25,252 --> 00:11:27,622
But now everybody knows and...

276
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:32,594
I am the most famous person
in the entire world.

277
00:11:33,528 --> 00:11:35,296
And I'm still broke.

278
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,868
I'm...

279
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:43,204
excited to see you tomorrow.

280
00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:46,473
<i>Yeah. Me too.</i>

281
00:11:46,608 --> 00:11:48,008
Wrap it up.

282
00:11:48,142 --> 00:11:49,977
You both like each other.
We get it. Hang up.

283
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:52,514
There's no new ground being
broken. I need my eight hours.

284
00:11:52,647 --> 00:11:54,215
Have you been listening

285
00:11:54,348 --> 00:11:56,217
- <i>Hi, Happy.</i>
- Not by choice.

286

MJ, you know
he's a murderer, right?

301
00:12:31,352 --> 00:12:32,886
Peter. Do a TikTok with me.

302
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:36,156
- Mysterio forever!
- Do a flip!

- Hey, let's see you and MJ kiss!

00:12:58,379 --> 00:12:59,246
No. Go.

314
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,881
I'll see you inside, okay?

315
00:13:02,383 --> 00:13:04,451
<i>Keep watching</i> Midtown News
<i>all year</i>

316
00:13:04,586 --> 00:13:06,588
<i>as we bring you up close

317
00:13:06,721 --> 00:13:09,724

318
00:13:09,857 --> 00:13:11,526
<i>college admissions.</i>

319
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:20,769
Peter, we would love to welcome
you back to Midtown High,

320
00:13:20,901 --> 00:13:22,737
where we shape heroes.

321
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,673
Yeah, uh-huh. Or murderers.

322
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:25,906
Stop it.

323
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,409
It's an honor
to serve you, sir.

324
00:13:28,543 --> 00:13:29,511
It's not.

325
00:13:29,644 --> 00:13:30,911
Mysterio was right.

326
00:13:31,045 --> 00:13:32,747
- Stop. That's all.
- Mysterio was right.

327
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,517
Some of the students
put this together for you.

328
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:38,285
- No, you did that.
- I helped a little bit.

329
00:13:38,419 --> 00:13:41,288
I tried to stop you so
many times but you powered through.

330
00:13:41,422 --> 00:13:43,257
- He did all of that.
- Did a great job.

331
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:45,326
I hope you have time
to check it out.

332
00:13:45,459 --> 00:13:48,128
Feel free to walk
or swing through the hallway.

333
00:13:48,262 --> 00:13:50,732
Or crawl on the ceiling
to avoid everybody.

334
00:13:50,864 --> 00:13:52,966
- We all know you can do it.
- I'm just gonna...

335
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,168
I know what you did.

336
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:55,436
Stop. You're
embarrassing yourself.

337
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:57,071
He's a conspiracy
theorist.

338
00:14:11,218 --> 00:14:13,153
Can we just stay up here
all day?

339
00:14:13,287 --> 00:14:15,724
- It is so crazy down there.
- This one's good.

340
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:17,592
"Some suggest
that Parker's powers

341
00:14:17,726 --> 00:14:20,829
include the male spider's
ability to hypnotize females,

342
00:14:20,961 --> 00:14:23,765
which he used to seduce
Jones-Watson

343
00:14:23,897 --> 00:14:26,467
- into his cult of personality."
- Oh, come on. Stop. Stop.

344
00:14:26,601 --> 00:14:28,902
Yes, my Spider-Lord.

345
00:14:36,778 --> 00:14:38,946
Finally some privacy.

346
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:41,583
It is so crazy down there.

347
00:14:41,716 --> 00:14:43,818
So I was thinking...

348
00:14:43,951 --> 00:14:47,221
when we get into MIT,
we should live together.

349
00:14:47,354 --> 00:14:49,957
- Yeah, for sure.
- Yeah, I'd love that.

350
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,026
- This is gonna be us.
- Yes.

351
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,863
Minus the Frisbee
and the smiling.

352
00:14:54,995 --> 00:14:56,798
MIT's obviously the dream,

353
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:58,800
but if we match up
our backup schools,

354
00:14:58,932 --> 00:15:01,068
then either way,
we'll be in Boston.

355
00:15:01,201 --> 00:15:03,170
New school, new town.
I can Spider-Man there.

356
00:15:03,303 --> 00:15:05,406
- They have crime in Boston, right?
- Yes.

357
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:08,208
- Wicked crime.
- It'll be like a fresh start.

358
00:15:09,878 --> 00:15:11,679
What's up?

359
00:15:11,813 --> 00:15:14,415
I don't know. I just feel
like, if you don't...

360
00:15:14,549 --> 00:15:16,383
If you expect disappointment,

361
00:15:16,518 --> 00:15:18,720
then you can never really
get disappointed.

362
00:15:18,853 --> 00:15:20,287
Come on.

363
00:15:21,856 --> 00:15:24,692
Be a fresh start.
And we'll all be together.

364
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,462
Yeah. No, you're right.
Fresh start.

365
00:15:28,596 --> 00:15:29,631
Yeah.

366
00:15:32,366 --> 00:15:33,868
Fresh start.

367
00:15:36,136 --> 00:15:37,471
First one's here!

368
00:15:41,975 --> 00:15:43,812
It's okay.
It's a backup school.

369
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:46,146
Peter!

370
00:15:48,348 --> 00:15:49,383
No?

371
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:53,020
Last one.

372
00:15:54,722 --> 00:15:55,757
MIT?

373
00:15:59,694 --> 00:16:01,428
Uh... Okay.

374
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,374
Okay.

375
00:16:14,509 --> 00:16:15,944
- Phew.
- Ready?

376
00:16:16,076 --> 00:16:19,213
Jones. I told you to take down
the Halloween decorations.

377
00:16:19,346 --> 00:16:20,949
Actually, that was Sasha so...

378
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:22,884
Enough attitude.
Just do it.

379
00:16:23,885 --> 00:16:24,919
On it.

380
00:16:26,053 --> 00:16:27,522
Feel like I'm gonna puke.

381
00:16:27,655 --> 00:16:30,224
Don't, because he will
just make me clean it.

382
00:16:30,357 --> 00:16:32,894
This is our only shot.
It's here or nowhere.

383
00:16:33,026 --> 00:16:35,062
- Hey. Come on.
- Okay. You guys ready?

384
00:16:35,195 --> 00:16:37,699
- Yeah. - Yeah.
- Okay, on three.

385
00:16:37,832 --> 00:16:40,702
One, two, three.

386
00:17:03,558 --> 00:17:06,426
No.

387
00:17:06,561 --> 00:17:08,195
You?

388
00:17:08,328 --> 00:17:10,364
"In light of recent controversy,

389
00:17:10,497 --> 00:17:15,603
we are unable to consider
your application at this time."

390
00:17:15,737 --> 00:17:17,170
This is so not fair.

391
00:17:17,304 --> 00:17:19,941
I mean, this is so not fair.
I didn't do anything wrong.

392
00:17:20,073 --> 00:17:22,109
You guys definitely
didn't do anything wrong.

393
00:17:22,242 --> 00:17:25,947
Expect disappointment and
you will never get disappointed.

394
00:17:27,381 --> 00:17:29,249
♪ No sleep till ♪

395
00:17:32,486 --> 00:17:33,788
♪ Boston ♪

396
00:17:38,593 --> 00:17:40,028
You guys didn't get in?

397
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,830
Yeah, because we're actually
friends with Spider-Man.

398
00:17:44,999 --> 00:17:47,167
Uh, yeah. I better get going.

399
00:17:47,301 --> 00:17:50,304
There's a mixer
for new admissions and...

400
00:17:50,437 --> 00:17:52,306
Sorry, guys.

401
00:17:52,439 --> 00:17:54,207
Jones, what are you doing?
Get back to work.

402
00:17:54,341 --> 00:17:55,843
Yeah, I'm coming.

403
00:17:55,977 --> 00:17:57,011
Know what?

404
00:17:58,813 --> 00:18:00,582
I wouldn't change
a thing I did.

405
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:03,317
Me neither.

406
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:08,890
Although I do need to show
this letter to my parents.

407
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,561
Um, hi.

408
00:19:23,698 --> 00:19:24,732
Hi?

409
00:19:25,767 --> 00:19:27,234
I'm, uh...

410
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:29,403
The most famous person
in the world.

411
00:19:29,537 --> 00:19:30,571
I know.

412
00:19:31,572 --> 00:19:33,373
Wong. Try not to slip.

413
00:19:33,508 --> 00:19:35,208
We don't have
liability insurance.

414
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:40,213
Is all this
for a holiday party?

415
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:44,317
No. One of the rotunda
gateways connects to Siberia.

416
00:19:44,451 --> 00:19:46,219
A blizzard blasted through.

417
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:50,792
Because someone forgot to cast
a monthly maintenance spell

418
00:19:50,925 --> 00:19:52,292
to keep the seals tight.

419
00:19:52,426 --> 00:19:54,261
That's right, he did,
because he forgot

420
00:19:54,394 --> 00:19:56,664
- I now have higher duties.
- Higher duties?

421
00:19:56,798 --> 00:19:59,000
The Sorcerer Supreme
has higher duties. Yes.

422
00:19:59,133 --> 00:20:01,268
Wait, I thought you were
the Sorcerer Supreme.

423
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:02,970
No, he got it
on a technicality

424
00:20:03,104 --> 00:20:04,639
because I blipped
for five years.

425
00:20:04,772 --> 00:20:07,642
- Oh, well, congratulations.
- If I'd been here, then...

426
00:20:07,775 --> 00:20:08,876
You'd burn the place down.

427
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:11,311
You two, no one said
stop shoveling.

428
00:20:11,445 --> 00:20:14,515
So, Peter, to what
do I owe the pleasure?

429
00:20:14,649 --> 00:20:17,652
Right. I'm really sorry
to bother you, sir.

430
00:20:17,785 --> 00:20:19,854
Please. We saved half
the universe together.

431
00:20:19,987 --> 00:20:21,856
Think we're beyond
you calling me "sir."

432
00:20:21,989 --> 00:20:23,524
Okay, uh, Stephen.

433
00:20:23,658 --> 00:20:25,526
That feels weird,
but I'll allow it.

434
00:20:28,129 --> 00:20:29,764
When...

435
00:20:29,897 --> 00:20:32,834
When Mysterio
revealed my identity...

436
00:20:32,967 --> 00:20:36,504
my entire life got screwed up
and I was wondering...

437
00:20:36,637 --> 00:20:38,506
I don't know
if this would actually work,

438
00:20:38,639 --> 00:20:41,008
but I was wondering if...

439
00:20:41,142 --> 00:20:44,812
maybe you could go back in time
and make it so he never did?

440
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,615
Peter...

441
00:20:47,749 --> 00:20:50,218
we tampered with the stability
of space-time

442
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,886
to resurrect countless lives.

443
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:54,321
You wanna do it again now
because yours got messy?

444
00:20:54,454 --> 00:20:55,857
It's not about me.

445
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:58,391
I mean, this is really hurting
a lot of people.

446
00:20:58,526 --> 00:21:01,028
My Aunt May, Happy,

447
00:21:01,162 --> 00:21:02,663
my best friend,
my girlfriend,

448
00:21:02,797 --> 00:21:05,199
their futures are ruined
just because they know me,

449
00:21:05,332 --> 00:21:06,734
and they've done
nothing wrong.

450
00:21:06,868 --> 00:21:08,903
I am so sorry...

451
00:21:09,971 --> 00:21:12,039
but even if I wanted to...

452
00:21:12,173 --> 00:21:14,609
I don't have
the Time Stone anymore.

453
00:21:16,878 --> 00:21:17,912
That's right.

454
00:21:21,649 --> 00:21:24,585
I'm really sorry
if I wasted your time.

455
00:21:24,719 --> 00:21:27,287
- No. You didn't.
- Just forget about it.

456
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:30,290
He will. He's very good
at forgetting things.

457
00:21:31,859 --> 00:21:34,695
Wong, you've actually
generated a good idea.

458
00:21:34,829 --> 00:21:35,763
What?

459
00:21:35,897 --> 00:21:37,932
The Runes of Kof-Kol.

460
00:21:38,065 --> 00:21:39,667
The Runes of Kof-Kol?

461
00:21:39,801 --> 00:21:41,702
It's just a standard
spell of forgetting.

462
00:21:41,836 --> 00:21:43,871
Won't turn back time,
but people will forget

463
00:21:44,005 --> 00:21:45,106
you were ever Spider-Man.

464
00:21:45,239 --> 00:21:47,108
- Seriously?
- No, not seriously.

465
00:21:47,241 --> 00:21:49,010
That spell travels
the dark borders

466
00:21:49,143 --> 00:21:50,778
between known
and unknown reality.

467
00:21:50,912 --> 00:21:52,180
It's too dangerous.

468
00:21:53,181 --> 00:21:54,782
We've used it for a lot less.

469
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:57,018
Do you remember the full moon
party at Kamar-Taj?

470
00:21:57,151 --> 00:21:58,753
- No.
- Exactly.

471
00:22:02,123 --> 00:22:03,724
Come on, Wong.

472
00:22:05,193 --> 00:22:07,061
Hasn't he been through enough?

473
00:22:14,101 --> 00:22:16,336
Just leave me out of this.

474
00:22:16,469 --> 00:22:17,505
Fine.

475
00:22:18,739 --> 00:22:19,774
Fine.

476
00:22:31,819 --> 00:22:34,121
So, what is this place?

477
00:22:34,255 --> 00:22:36,290
The Sanctum's built
at the intersection

478
00:22:36,423 --> 00:22:38,059
of cosmic energy currents.

479
00:22:38,192 --> 00:22:40,393
We weren't the first
to seek them out.

480
00:22:40,528 --> 00:22:43,898
Some of these walls
are thousands of years old.

481
00:22:44,031 --> 00:22:47,501
And they shot an episode of
<i>The Equalizer</i> here in the '80s.

482
00:22:47,635 --> 00:22:48,669
Well, I, um...

483
00:22:50,571 --> 00:22:53,140
really appreciate you
doing this for me, sir.

484
00:22:53,274 --> 00:22:54,342
Don't mention it.

485
00:22:56,077 --> 00:22:58,411
And don't call me "sir."

486
00:22:58,546 --> 00:23:00,281
Right. Sorry.

487
00:23:00,413 --> 00:23:01,682
You ready?

488
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:03,784
I'm ready.

489
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,889
Nice knowing you, Spider-Man.

490
00:23:11,993 --> 00:23:13,527
Wait, excuse me?

491
00:23:14,929 --> 00:23:16,463
The entire world's
about to forget

492
00:23:16,597 --> 00:23:19,000
that Peter Parker
is Spider-Man.

493
00:23:19,133 --> 00:23:20,534
- Including me.
- Everyone?

494
00:23:20,668 --> 00:23:23,337
Uh, can't some people
still know?

495
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:25,673
That's not how
the spell works.

496
00:23:25,806 --> 00:23:27,375
And it's very difficult
and dangerous

497
00:23:27,508 --> 00:23:28,976
to change it mid-casting.

498
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:31,178
So my girlfriend's
gonna forget everything?

499
00:23:31,312 --> 00:23:32,747
Is she even gonna be
my girlfriend?

500
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,216
Was she your girlfriend
because you were Spider-Man?

501
00:23:35,349 --> 00:23:38,853
- I don't know. I really hope not.
- All right, fine.

502
00:23:38,986 --> 00:23:41,555
Everyone in the world's
gonna forget you're Spider-Man

503
00:23:41,689 --> 00:23:43,291
except your girlfriend.

504
00:23:43,423 --> 00:23:45,192
Thank you so much.

505
00:23:45,326 --> 00:23:47,295
Oh, my God, Ned. Ned.

506
00:23:48,763 --> 00:23:50,164
What is a Ned?

507
00:23:50,298 --> 00:23:51,399
He's my best friend

508
00:23:51,532 --> 00:23:53,734
so it's important to me
that Ned knows.

509
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:01,342
Okay, let's not change
the parameters of this spell

510
00:24:01,474 --> 00:24:03,144
any more
while I'm casting it.

511
00:24:03,277 --> 00:24:05,680
Okay, I'm done.
I swear I'm done. I'm done.

512
00:24:05,813 --> 00:24:07,248
But my Aunt May
should really know.

513
00:24:07,381 --> 00:24:08,883
Peter, stop tampering
with the spell.

514
00:24:09,016 --> 00:24:11,385
When she found out,
it was really messy.

515
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:14,055
I don't think
I could go through that again.

516
00:24:15,022 --> 00:24:16,357
- So my Aunt May?
- Yes.

517
00:24:16,489 --> 00:24:17,725
Thank you. Happy?

518
00:24:17,858 --> 00:24:19,093
No, I'm annoyed.

519
00:24:19,226 --> 00:24:21,028
No, it's a nickname.
Harold "Happy" Hogan.

520
00:24:21,162 --> 00:24:23,297
He used to work with Tony Stark,
but then he was...

521
00:24:23,431 --> 00:24:25,700
Could you just stop talking?

522
00:24:33,174 --> 00:24:34,909
Basically everyone that knew

523
00:24:35,042 --> 00:24:37,545
I was Spider-Man before
should still know!

524
00:24:58,065 --> 00:24:59,433
- Did it work?
- No.

525
00:24:59,567 --> 00:25:02,370
You changed my spell six times.

526
00:25:02,503 --> 00:25:04,071
- Five times.
- You changed my spell.

527
00:25:04,205 --> 00:25:07,541
You don't do that. I told you.
And that is why.

528
00:25:07,675 --> 00:25:10,277
That spell was out of control.
If I hadn't shut it down,

529
00:25:10,411 --> 00:25:12,680
something catastrophic
could have happened.

530
00:25:12,813 --> 00:25:16,117
- Stephen, listen, I am so...
- Call me "sir."

531
00:25:17,985 --> 00:25:19,253
Sorry, sir.

532
00:25:20,488 --> 00:25:22,189
After everything
we've been through,

533
00:25:22,323 --> 00:25:26,494
somehow I always forget
you're just a kid.

534
00:25:26,627 --> 00:25:29,663
Look, Parker, the problem
is not Mysterio.

535
00:25:29,797 --> 00:25:31,999
It's you trying to live
two different lives.

536
00:25:32,133 --> 00:25:34,535
And the longer you do that,
the more dangerous it becomes.

537
00:25:34,668 --> 00:25:36,604
Believe me. I'm so sorry

538
00:25:36,737 --> 00:25:39,774
about you and your friends
not getting into college,

539
00:25:39,907 --> 00:25:42,910
but if they rejected you
and you tried

540
00:25:43,044 --> 00:25:44,445
to convince them to reconsider,

541
00:25:44,578 --> 00:25:46,781
there's nothing else
you can do.

542
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:51,819
When you say, "Convince them,"

543
00:25:51,952 --> 00:25:54,955
- you mean I could have called them?
- Yeah.

544
00:25:55,089 --> 00:25:56,257
I could do that?

545
00:25:57,792 --> 00:25:59,593
You haven't called the...?

546
00:25:59,727 --> 00:26:01,429
I got their letter.
I assumed that was...

547
00:26:01,562 --> 00:26:04,932
I'm sorry.
Are you telling me

548
00:26:05,066 --> 00:26:07,935
that you didn't even think to
plead your case with them first

549
00:26:08,069 --> 00:26:11,705
before you asked me
to brainwash the entire world?

550
00:26:14,308 --> 00:26:16,410
Well, I mean,
when you put it like that...

551
00:26:24,185 --> 00:26:25,686
Come on, pick up, pick up.

552
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,188
Dude, what? I'm busy.

553
00:26:27,321 --> 00:26:29,490
- Flash, where's the MIT mixer?
- <i>Why?</i>

554
00:26:29,623 --> 00:26:31,225
Because I need
to talk to someone.

555
00:26:31,358 --> 00:26:33,094
I'm trying to get Ned and MJ
a second chance at getting in.

556
00:26:33,227 --> 00:26:34,563
What's in it for me?

557
00:26:34,695 --> 00:26:36,397
<i>I'm risking a lot
just talking to you.</i>

558
00:26:36,531 --> 00:26:39,400
Okay, I will, um...

559
00:26:39,534 --> 00:26:42,002
pick you up and swing you
to school for one week?

560
00:26:42,136 --> 00:26:43,337
For a month.

561
00:26:43,471 --> 00:26:45,206
- <i>For a week.</i>
- Two weeks.

562
00:26:45,339 --> 00:26:48,209
- Flash, please. Help me.
- You know what I want.

563
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:51,645
Okay, I'll tell everyone
you're my best friend.

564
00:26:51,779 --> 00:26:53,681
- <i>Flash, please help me.</i>
- Cool, cool, cool.

565
00:26:53,814 --> 00:26:55,349
<i>There's the
assistant vice chancellor.</i>

566
00:26:55,483 --> 00:26:56,750
<i>You can plead your case
with her.</i>

567
00:26:56,884 --> 00:26:58,553
- Perfect. Where is she?
- She left.

568
00:26:58,686 --> 00:27:00,387
- To go where?
- To the airport.

569
00:27:07,128 --> 00:27:09,396
<i>Stark network unavailable.</i>

570
00:27:09,531 --> 00:27:12,032
<i>Facial recognition unavailable.</i>

571
00:27:15,369 --> 00:27:16,403
Hi.

572
00:27:18,339 --> 00:27:20,274
Yeah, I can see you.

573
00:27:30,284 --> 00:27:31,452
Oh, my God.

574
00:27:33,787 --> 00:27:35,322
- That's Peter Parker.
- Mom.

575
00:27:35,456 --> 00:27:36,991
- Mom, look.
- Mommy.

576
00:27:37,124 --> 00:27:38,759
No, it's Peter Parker.

577
00:27:48,402 --> 00:27:49,803
Hey.

578
00:27:49,937 --> 00:27:51,272
Okay.

579
00:27:51,405 --> 00:27:52,973
Whew.

580
00:28:01,849 --> 00:28:04,752
- Yeah.
- Hi. I'm Peter Parker.

581
00:28:04,885 --> 00:28:06,487
You do know you're
in the street, right?

582
00:28:06,621 --> 00:28:08,722
Yeah, I'm sorry. I really
needed to talk to you

583
00:28:08,856 --> 00:28:10,625
and I know you're
on your way to the airport.

584
00:28:10,758 --> 00:28:14,261
MJ Watson and Ned Leeds are the
two smartest people I've met,

585
00:28:14,395 --> 00:28:16,697
and I'm the dumbest person
because I let them help me,

586
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:18,699
but if I didn't,
millions would've died,

587
00:28:18,832 --> 00:28:20,935
so please don't let MIT
be dumb like me.

588
00:28:21,068 --> 00:28:22,102
MIT is dumb?

589
00:28:22,236 --> 00:28:25,005
No, I'm saying
don't let MIT be dumb.

590
00:28:25,139 --> 00:28:27,441
I mean, like
the dumber version of me

591
00:28:27,576 --> 00:28:29,710
that wouldn't have
let them help.

592
00:28:31,011 --> 00:28:32,880
You didn't rehearse that,
did you, Peter?

593
00:28:34,649 --> 00:28:36,183
Basically, what I'm trying to...

594
00:28:44,325 --> 00:28:45,627
Why are you running?

595
00:28:49,631 --> 00:28:51,165
Oh, my God.

596
00:28:51,298 --> 00:28:53,200
Ma'am, you should get out
of the car.

597
00:28:53,334 --> 00:28:55,537
Everybody get off the bridge!

598
00:28:57,438 --> 00:28:58,472
The door's locked.

599
00:28:58,607 --> 00:29:00,341
Door's... Hey!

600
00:29:17,191 --> 00:29:18,492
Hello, Peter.

601
00:29:19,527 --> 00:29:21,428
Hi? Do we...? Do I know you?

602
00:29:21,563 --> 00:29:23,764
What have you done
with my machine?

603
00:29:23,897 --> 00:29:26,701
I don't know what you're
talking about. What machine?

604
00:29:26,834 --> 00:29:29,738
The power of the sun
in the palm of my hand.

605
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:31,105
It's gone.

606
00:29:31,238 --> 00:29:33,274
Listen, sir,
if you stop smashing cars,

607
00:29:33,407 --> 00:29:36,010
we can work together and I can
help you find your machine.

608
00:29:36,143 --> 00:29:37,712
You want to play games?

609
00:29:40,314 --> 00:29:41,448
Catch.

610
00:29:58,465 --> 00:30:00,868
It's okay. You guys are good.
You're safe. Get out.

611
00:30:01,001 --> 00:30:04,539
You think your fancy new suit's
gonna save you?

612
00:30:18,385 --> 00:30:20,254
Should've killed
your little girlfriend

613
00:30:20,387 --> 00:30:21,623
when I had the chance.

614
00:30:25,527 --> 00:30:26,894
What did you just say?

615
00:30:27,027 --> 00:30:29,263
Looks like we got competition.

616
00:30:49,116 --> 00:30:51,452
Peter! Help!

617
00:31:13,307 --> 00:31:15,409
Don't worry, ma'am! I'm coming!

618
00:31:17,545 --> 00:31:18,747
Peter!

619
00:31:45,673 --> 00:31:47,174
Ma'am, just stay calm.

620
00:31:47,307 --> 00:31:48,409
Just take
a deep breath.

621
00:31:48,543 --> 00:31:50,745
- Are you okay?
- No!

622
00:31:52,614 --> 00:31:55,215
I promise, I've got this
all under control.

623
00:32:01,922 --> 00:32:03,991
<i>Suit compromised.</i>

624
00:32:04,124 --> 00:32:06,160
Nanotechnology.

625
00:32:06,293 --> 00:32:08,495
Ah, you've outdone yourself,
Peter.

626
00:32:14,935 --> 00:32:16,638
I underestimated you.

627
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:19,306
But now you die.

628
00:32:35,489 --> 00:32:36,957
You're not Peter Parker.

629
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:39,561
I am so confused right now.

630
00:32:41,863 --> 00:32:43,230
What's happening?

631
00:32:43,363 --> 00:32:44,866
<i>New device detected.</i>

632
00:32:47,067 --> 00:32:48,302
<i>Pairing new device.</i>

633
00:32:52,105 --> 00:32:55,042
You don't listen to him.
You listen to me.

634
00:33:00,882 --> 00:33:01,916
Hey.

635
00:33:09,189 --> 00:33:10,424
Whoa.

636
00:33:14,896 --> 00:33:16,564
Hey. Hey!

637
00:33:16,698 --> 00:33:18,465
Listen to me.

638
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,568
No, not him.
Me.

639
00:33:27,374 --> 00:33:28,643
Ma'am, you okay?

640
00:33:28,776 --> 00:33:31,245
Come on, you can still
make your flight.

641
00:33:31,378 --> 00:33:32,412
Peter.

642
00:33:33,982 --> 00:33:35,015
You're a hero.

643
00:33:35,148 --> 00:33:37,519
No. Well, I'm... No, I'm...

644
00:33:37,652 --> 00:33:40,420
I'm gonna talk to Admissions
about your friends.

645
00:33:40,555 --> 00:33:42,924
And I'm gonna talk
to them about you.

646
00:33:43,056 --> 00:33:45,158
But, ma'am,
this isn't about me.

647
00:33:45,292 --> 00:33:49,196
I am going to talk to them
about your friends and you.

648
00:33:49,329 --> 00:33:50,865
- Okay?
- Really?

649
00:33:50,999 --> 00:33:52,499
And if you keep
your noses clean,

650
00:33:52,634 --> 00:33:54,034
maybe you'll have a fair shot.

651
00:33:54,167 --> 00:33:56,638
Here. Get out of the way.
Let me get that man.

652
00:33:56,771 --> 00:33:58,640
Hey! You! I see you.
Come here!

653
00:33:58,773 --> 00:34:01,308
That was not okay.
Unbelievable.

654
00:34:02,644 --> 00:34:03,811
Who are...?

655
00:34:03,945 --> 00:34:05,078
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

656
00:34:05,212 --> 00:34:06,848
Until you stop
trying to kill me,

657
00:34:06,981 --> 00:34:08,016
I'm in control, buddy,

658
00:34:08,148 --> 00:34:10,083
of this whole
tentacle situation

659
00:34:10,217 --> 00:34:11,819
you got going on here,
okay?

660
00:34:11,953 --> 00:34:13,955
Now, who are you?
What is going...?

661
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:24,364
No.

662
00:34:31,271 --> 00:34:32,540
Osborn?

663
00:34:55,362 --> 00:34:56,229
Doctor...?

664
00:35:04,104 --> 00:35:08,241
Be careful
what you wish for, Parker.

665
00:35:08,375 --> 00:35:09,877
Let me out of here!

666
00:35:10,011 --> 00:35:12,013
Can you please explain to me
what is going on?

667
00:35:12,145 --> 00:35:13,715
That little spell
that you botched

668
00:35:13,848 --> 00:35:15,248
where you wanted
everyone to forget

669
00:35:15,382 --> 00:35:16,584
that Peter Parker's
Spider-Man,

670
00:35:16,718 --> 00:35:18,019
it started pulling in
everyone

671
00:35:18,151 --> 00:35:19,587
who knows
Peter Parker's Spider-Man

672
00:35:19,721 --> 00:35:23,357
from every universe
into this one.

673
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:26,393
- From every universe?
- Who are you? And where am I?

674
00:35:26,527 --> 00:35:27,895
I think it's
better we don't engage

675
00:35:28,029 --> 00:35:29,229
with them because,
frankly,

676
00:35:29,363 --> 00:35:31,164
the multiverse
is a concept about which

677
00:35:31,298 --> 00:35:33,735
we know frighteningly little.

678
00:35:33,868 --> 00:35:36,037
The multiverse is real?

679
00:35:36,169 --> 00:35:37,772
This shouldn't even be possible.

680
00:35:37,905 --> 00:35:40,108
- I thought you stopped the spell.
- No, I contained it.

681
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,442
It would appear
a few of them squeaked through.

682
00:35:42,577 --> 00:35:44,812
After you left, I detected
an otherworldly presence.

683
00:35:44,946 --> 00:35:48,248
I pursued it into the sewers,
where I found that...

684
00:35:48,382 --> 00:35:50,752
slimy green son of a gun.

685
00:35:50,885 --> 00:35:53,621
Spell? As in magic?

686
00:35:53,755 --> 00:35:55,657
What is this,
a birthday party?

687
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:58,225
Who is this clown?
What is this madness?

688
00:35:58,358 --> 00:36:00,595
Watch this.
Do you know a Peter Parker

689
00:36:00,728 --> 00:36:02,496
- who's Spider-Man?
- Yes.

690
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:03,931
- Is that him?
- No.

691
00:36:04,065 --> 00:36:05,432
See?

692
00:36:06,433 --> 00:36:07,935
Okay, here's what we gotta do.

693
00:36:08,069 --> 00:36:10,303
I don't know how many
visitors we've got...

694
00:36:10,437 --> 00:36:12,940
I saw another one
on the bridge.

695
00:36:13,074 --> 00:36:16,544
He was like a
flying green elf.

696
00:36:16,678 --> 00:36:18,613
He sounds jolly.
Start with him.

697
00:36:18,746 --> 00:36:19,914
I need you
to capture them,

698
00:36:20,048 --> 00:36:21,481
bring them here
while I figure out

699
00:36:21,616 --> 00:36:23,051
how to get them back
before

700
00:36:23,183 --> 00:36:25,119
they destroy
the fabric of reality,

701
00:36:25,252 --> 00:36:27,454
or worse, Wong finds out.

702
00:36:27,588 --> 00:36:29,157
Uh, Doctor Strange?

703
00:36:29,289 --> 00:36:30,958
What?

704
00:36:31,092 --> 00:36:33,961
My friends and I just got a
second chance to get into MIT,

705
00:36:34,095 --> 00:36:36,831
and if the school sees me
fighting these crazy monsters...

706
00:36:36,964 --> 00:36:38,633
- Hey, watch your mouth.
- I'm sorry but...

707
00:36:38,766 --> 00:36:41,135
Are you seriously
still talking about college?

708
00:36:46,741 --> 00:36:49,043
- Hey, what did you just do?
- This.

709
00:36:50,645 --> 00:36:51,813
Hey, you can't just...

710
00:36:54,816 --> 00:36:55,883
How did you do that?

711
00:36:56,017 --> 00:36:58,019
Lots of birthday parties.

712
00:37:04,291 --> 00:37:05,358
Hey.

713
00:37:07,394 --> 00:37:08,462
Whoa.

714
00:37:08,596 --> 00:37:10,131
One shot,
send them here, move on.

715
00:37:10,263 --> 00:37:11,599
You're welcome. Get to work.

716
00:37:11,733 --> 00:37:12,600
Sir?

717
00:37:12,734 --> 00:37:15,503
Now what?

718
00:37:15,636 --> 00:37:18,305
I know this is my mess,
and I swear to you I'll fix it,

719
00:37:18,438 --> 00:37:20,007
but I'm gonna need help.

720
00:37:21,308 --> 00:37:22,777
Whoa!

721
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:25,546
I can't believe
I'm in the Sanctum Sanctorum.

722
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,347
Neither can I.

723
00:37:27,481 --> 00:37:30,051
So how did you know
you were a man of magic?

724
00:37:30,184 --> 00:37:32,352
Because my nana says
that we have it in our family,

725
00:37:32,486 --> 00:37:34,287
and I get these tinglings
in my hands...

726
00:37:34,421 --> 00:37:35,422
Talk to your physician.

727
00:37:35,556 --> 00:37:36,824
- Peter.
- Hey.

728
00:37:36,958 --> 00:37:38,726
- Hey. Hey.
- Hey. Hey.

729
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:40,360
Sorry for dragging you
into this.

730
00:37:40,494 --> 00:37:43,231
- Help me find these guys.
- You don't have to apologize.

731
00:37:43,363 --> 00:37:45,398
You got us a second shot
at MIT. It's fine.

732
00:37:45,533 --> 00:37:48,202
So how did the bad guys
get here?

733
00:37:48,335 --> 00:37:50,905
We screwed up a spell
trying to get you into college.

734
00:37:51,038 --> 00:37:52,573
- Wait. What?
- You did it with magic?

735
00:37:52,707 --> 00:37:54,575
I thought it was
the MIT lady you saved.

736
00:37:54,709 --> 00:37:56,077
No, that was after.

737
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:57,410
Let's just focus
on the good news, okay?

738
00:37:57,545 --> 00:37:59,247
No, let's just focus
on the bad news.

739
00:37:59,379 --> 00:38:03,416
As of now, you have detected
zero multiversal trespassers,

740
00:38:03,551 --> 00:38:07,755
so get on your phones,
scour the Internet, and...

741
00:38:07,889 --> 00:38:10,091
Scooby-Doo this shit.

742
00:38:10,224 --> 00:38:12,193
You're telling us
what to do even though

743
00:38:12,325 --> 00:38:14,095
it was your spell
that got screwed up,

744
00:38:14,228 --> 00:38:16,230
meaning that all this
is kind of your mess.

745
00:38:16,363 --> 00:38:18,866
I know a couple of
magic words myself,

746
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,235
starting with
the word "please."

747
00:38:23,971 --> 00:38:27,208
Please Scooby-Doo this shit.

748
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:29,610
You can work in the undercroft.

749
00:38:29,744 --> 00:38:32,113
The undercroft?

750
00:38:36,984 --> 00:38:38,052
Badass.

751
00:38:44,759 --> 00:38:47,662
- About this whole spell thing...
- It's totally okay.

752
00:38:47,795 --> 00:38:50,164
- Wait, really?
- Yeah. I mean, I get it.

753
00:38:50,298 --> 00:38:54,635
You were just trying
to fix things, and so...

754
00:38:54,769 --> 00:38:57,404
Maybe just run it by us
next time, you know?

755
00:38:57,538 --> 00:38:59,941
That way, when you're thinking,
"I'm about to do something

756
00:39:00,074 --> 00:39:02,743
that could break the universe,"

757
00:39:02,877 --> 00:39:06,614
we could, like, help you
workshop something or...

758
00:39:06,747 --> 00:39:09,482
brainstorm ideas.

759
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:12,553
Deal.

760
00:39:13,921 --> 00:39:15,623
Ned?

761
00:39:15,756 --> 00:39:18,759
Oh, dude, I don't care.
It's seriously not a big deal.

762
00:39:18,893 --> 00:39:20,895
Um, oh!

763
00:39:21,028 --> 00:39:23,164
A torture rack.

764
00:39:24,932 --> 00:39:27,168
That is a Pilates machine.

765
00:39:27,301 --> 00:39:28,669
- That is...
- The crypt.

766
00:39:28,803 --> 00:39:30,838
Okay, so we get
the rest of the guys,

767
00:39:30,972 --> 00:39:32,940
you zap them, Doctor Magic
will send them back,

768
00:39:33,074 --> 00:39:34,642
and when we get into MIT,

769
00:39:34,775 --> 00:39:37,011
round of stale doughnuts,
my treat.

770
00:39:37,144 --> 00:39:38,779
Let's catch
some multiverse men.

771
00:39:38,913 --> 00:39:41,816
Hey! Who the hell
are these two?

772
00:39:41,949 --> 00:39:43,885
- My friends. This is MJ.
- Hey.

773
00:39:44,018 --> 00:39:45,485
- And this is Ned.
- Hello.

774
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:47,454
Uh, I'm sorry,
what was your name again?

775
00:39:47,588 --> 00:39:49,489
Dr. Otto Octavius.

776
00:39:53,961 --> 00:39:56,030
Wait, no, seriously,
what's your actual name?

777
00:39:56,163 --> 00:39:57,665
Oh, is that
a dinosaur?

778
00:40:19,654 --> 00:40:21,722
<i>If the paint
won't come off, I'll get it out.</i>

779
00:40:21,856 --> 00:40:24,859
No, no, no. May. We gotta
find these guys first.

780
00:40:24,992 --> 00:40:27,028
<i>Well, finish your mission,
and then come by.</i>

781
00:40:27,161 --> 00:40:29,196
<i>We're having
a canned food drive.</i>

782
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:31,232
- That could work.
- I got one.

783
00:40:31,365 --> 00:40:32,800
- May, I gotta go.
- <i>Okay.</i>

784
00:40:32,934 --> 00:40:34,969
I mean, you can take
the guy out of the chair,

785
00:40:35,102 --> 00:40:37,171
but you can't take
the chair out of the guy.

786
00:40:37,305 --> 00:40:39,640
- What'd you find?
- There's a...

787
00:40:39,774 --> 00:40:42,243
A disturbance near
a military research facility

788
00:40:42,376 --> 00:40:43,511
outside of the city,

789
00:40:43,644 --> 00:40:45,246
and witnesses say
that they saw

790
00:40:45,379 --> 00:40:47,348
a monster flying
through the air.

791
00:40:48,849 --> 00:40:50,918
It's gotta be the guy
I saw on the bridge, right?

792
00:40:51,052 --> 00:40:52,286
That's impossible.

793
00:40:54,722 --> 00:40:55,957
You know him, don't you?

794
00:40:57,091 --> 00:40:59,727
On the bridge,
you said his name.

795
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:02,462
Norman Osborn.

796
00:41:02,596 --> 00:41:07,034
Brilliant scientist.
Military research.

797
00:41:07,168 --> 00:41:10,470
But he was greedy, misguided.

798
00:41:10,604 --> 00:41:14,875
- What happened to him?
- We tire of your questions, boy!

799
00:41:15,009 --> 00:41:17,545
Okay, um...

800
00:41:17,678 --> 00:41:19,914
I gotta go. Where am I going?

801
00:41:20,047 --> 00:41:21,082
It can't be him.

802
00:41:22,717 --> 00:41:24,352
Why?

803
00:41:24,484 --> 00:41:27,955
Because Norman Osborn
died years ago.

804
00:41:29,223 --> 00:41:32,793
So either we saw someone else...

805
00:41:32,927 --> 00:41:37,765
or you're flying out into
the darkness to fight a ghost.

806
00:42:01,255 --> 00:42:04,525
Keep an eye out on the trees.
We don't know where this guy is.

807
00:42:07,161 --> 00:42:10,464
<i>I genuinely don't know how you
do this without throwing up.</i>

808
00:42:27,915 --> 00:42:29,083
Did you guys see that?

809
00:42:29,216 --> 00:42:31,285
<i>Um, no.</i>

810
00:42:31,419 --> 00:42:33,120
<i>It's-It's really dark.</i>

811
00:42:45,132 --> 00:42:46,867
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

812
00:42:53,674 --> 00:42:54,875
<i>What-What's happening?</i>

813
00:42:55,009 --> 00:42:56,143
<i>Peter, what is it?</i>

814
00:42:58,547 --> 00:43:00,047
<i>Are you getting
the tingle thing?</i>

815
00:43:00,181 --> 00:43:02,551
<i>Is the tingle happening?
Is your tingle tingling?</i>

816
00:43:11,692 --> 00:43:13,828
- Are you guys seeing this?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

817
00:43:13,961 --> 00:43:15,062
<i>Osborn?</i>

818
00:43:15,196 --> 00:43:18,199
No. He was green.
This guy's blue.

819
00:43:18,332 --> 00:43:21,302
You wouldn't happen to be from
another universe, would you?

820
00:43:22,269 --> 00:43:23,704
<i>What's he doing?</i>

821
00:43:23,838 --> 00:43:25,406
<i>I don't know.
Looks like he's charging.</i>

822
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:27,475
I don't like this.
Just web him.

823
00:43:32,947 --> 00:43:34,348
Whoa!

824
00:43:39,954 --> 00:43:43,190
<i>Go left! Left, dude, left!
Left! Go! Left! Yes!</i>

825
00:43:43,324 --> 00:43:45,259
<i>What are you talking about?
Right.</i>

826
00:43:45,392 --> 00:43:47,661
<i>Go to the right! Right!
Right! He means right.</i>

827
00:43:47,795 --> 00:43:50,998
- <i>Don't listen to him.</i>
- Guys, this is not helping!

828
00:43:57,506 --> 00:44:00,374
Oh, no, no, no.
What happened? Peter? Peter.

829
00:44:07,448 --> 00:44:08,716
Whoa.

830
00:44:08,849 --> 00:44:13,387
Peter, it's me, Flint Marko.
You remember?

831
00:44:13,522 --> 00:44:15,055
I'm Peter,
but I'm not your Peter.

832
00:44:15,189 --> 00:44:16,724
What do you mean,
you're not my Peter?

833
00:44:16,857 --> 00:44:18,425
What the hell is going on?

834
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,794
I'll explain, but first,
can you help me?

835
00:44:20,928 --> 00:44:22,763
- Okay.
- You try to surround him,

836
00:44:22,897 --> 00:44:25,232
and I'll pull the plug.
All right, let's go!

837
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:42,783
I can't hold him much longer.

838
00:44:42,917 --> 00:44:44,485
I got it, I got it!

839
00:45:12,112 --> 00:45:14,348
Different Peter. Weird.

840
00:45:14,481 --> 00:45:17,652
- Thanks. Sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

841
00:45:25,893 --> 00:45:28,095
I got my body back.

842
00:45:28,229 --> 00:45:29,863
Hey, um...

843
00:45:29,997 --> 00:45:31,799
This is gonna sound
really crazy,

844
00:45:31,932 --> 00:45:33,501
but this isn't your universe.

845
00:45:33,635 --> 00:45:34,835
Another universe?

846
00:45:34,969 --> 00:45:35,970
- Uh-huh.
- What?

847
00:45:36,103 --> 00:45:37,938
That's what I was feeling.

848
00:45:38,072 --> 00:45:40,207
The power, it's different.

849
00:45:41,942 --> 00:45:42,977
I like it.

850
00:45:45,145 --> 00:45:46,480
Easy, buddy.

851
00:45:46,615 --> 00:45:48,482
It's actually my fault
that you're here.

852
00:45:48,617 --> 00:45:52,353
Like, the universe or the woods?

853
00:45:52,486 --> 00:45:53,354
I hate the woods.

854
00:45:53,487 --> 00:45:55,356
I meant the universe, sir.

855
00:45:55,489 --> 00:45:57,157
So, what, y'all
just gonna stand here

856
00:45:57,291 --> 00:45:58,859
and act like I ain't
butt-ass naked?

857
00:45:58,993 --> 00:46:01,161
- I am.
- No, no.

858
00:46:01,295 --> 00:46:02,363
I, uh...

859
00:46:14,241 --> 00:46:16,877
What was that?
What did you just do to him?

860
00:46:17,011 --> 00:46:18,946
- No. It's okay.
- Did you kill him?

861
00:46:19,079 --> 00:46:20,715
I can explain everything.
Trust me.

862
00:46:20,848 --> 00:46:22,182
Please just trust me.

863
00:46:22,316 --> 00:46:24,184
I don't trust you.
I don't know you.

864
00:46:27,154 --> 00:46:28,255
What is this?

865
00:46:29,557 --> 00:46:31,058
You picked the wrong side.

866
00:46:33,794 --> 00:46:34,995
Connors?

867
00:46:36,463 --> 00:46:38,566
Wait. You know this creature?

868
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:42,771
No, no, no.
Not a creature. A man.

869
00:46:42,903 --> 00:46:44,104
The same universes.

870
00:46:44,238 --> 00:46:46,273
Dr. Curt Connors.
He was a scientist

871
00:46:46,407 --> 00:46:48,175
at Oscorp when I worked there.

872
00:46:48,309 --> 00:46:50,277
A brilliant scientist.

873
00:46:50,411 --> 00:46:52,012
Until he turned himself
into a lizard.

874
00:46:52,146 --> 00:46:54,214
Then he tried to turn
the whole city into lizards.

875
00:46:54,348 --> 00:46:56,718
- It was crazy.
- It wasn't crazy, Max.

876
00:46:56,850 --> 00:46:58,919
It was the next step
in human evolution.

877
00:46:59,053 --> 00:47:01,088
- The dinosaur can talk. Right.
- Lizard.

878
00:47:01,221 --> 00:47:03,023
Speaking of which
what happened to you?

879
00:47:03,157 --> 00:47:04,992
Last I recall,
you had bad teeth,

880
00:47:05,125 --> 00:47:06,594
glasses and a comb-over.

881
00:47:06,728 --> 00:47:09,229
Did you get a makeover?

882
00:47:09,363 --> 00:47:11,800
You know I can give you
a real makeover.

883
00:47:11,932 --> 00:47:13,267
Let me guess, into a lizard?

884
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,903
- Exactly.
- Would you two just shut up?

885
00:47:16,036 --> 00:47:17,672
- Where are we?
- It's complicated.

886
00:47:17,806 --> 00:47:20,407
- A wizard's dungeon.
- Wizard's dungeon?

887
00:47:20,542 --> 00:47:22,309
There's no real way
to sugarcoat that.

888
00:47:22,443 --> 00:47:24,178
It's literally the dungeon
of a wizard.

889
00:47:24,311 --> 00:47:26,847
You can keep your magic.

890
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:29,718
I want a taste of that
new energy I just felt.

891
00:47:33,087 --> 00:47:36,023
- Oh, Peter, hey.
- Did those guys come through yet?

892
00:47:36,156 --> 00:47:38,092
There should be
an electric guy and a sand guy.

893
00:47:38,225 --> 00:47:40,729
Yeah, they're all here
and locked up.

894
00:47:40,861 --> 00:47:42,496
Perfect. I'm gonna just
stay here for a bit

895
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:43,832
and try and fix
some of this damage

896
00:47:43,964 --> 00:47:45,567
so they don't blame it
on me again.

897
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:48,902
- <i>Okay.</i>
- But, hey, I, uh...

898
00:47:49,036 --> 00:47:51,506
I couldn't do any of this
without you, so thank you.

899
00:47:51,639 --> 00:47:52,607
<i>Yeah, of course.</i>

900
00:47:52,741 --> 00:47:54,609
Hey, ask him if this is,

901
00:47:54,743 --> 00:47:56,578
like, a tree monster
or, like,

902
00:47:56,711 --> 00:47:58,613
a scientist
that turned into a tree.

903
00:47:58,747 --> 00:48:02,015
It's just a tree, man.
Just a tree.

904
00:48:18,666 --> 00:48:22,302
<i>Coward.
We have a new world to conquer.</i>

905
00:48:24,471 --> 00:48:25,673
<i>You make me sick.</i>

906
00:48:25,807 --> 00:48:27,742
Leave me alone, please.

907
00:48:27,876 --> 00:48:30,911
<i>Hiding in the shadows.</i>

908
00:48:31,044 --> 00:48:33,280
<i>Hiding from who you truly are.</i>

909
00:48:33,414 --> 00:48:36,984
- No.
- <i>You can't escape yourself.</i>

910
00:48:52,933 --> 00:48:56,336
- Hey, May.
- <i>Hey, Peter. I'm at work, and...</i>

911
00:48:56,470 --> 00:48:59,507
<i>one of the guys you're
looking for just walked in.</i>

912
00:49:07,481 --> 00:49:09,283
May? Where's May?

913
00:49:09,416 --> 00:49:10,451
Thank you.

914
00:49:13,521 --> 00:49:14,556
May.

915
00:49:16,524 --> 00:49:18,192
Ah, hey, here he is.

916
00:49:18,325 --> 00:49:21,596
Norman, this is my nephew.

917
00:49:23,063 --> 00:49:25,600
Norman Osborn?
I thought that you were...

918
00:49:25,733 --> 00:49:30,204
I saw Spider-Man
in an ad for this place.

919
00:49:30,337 --> 00:49:32,707
And I thought
he could help me.

920
00:49:32,841 --> 00:49:34,074
But you're not him.

921
00:49:34,208 --> 00:49:36,511
Wait, so you want
Spider-Man's help?

922
00:49:36,644 --> 00:49:38,378
He just wandered in.

923
00:49:41,248 --> 00:49:43,183
I didn't know
where else to go.

924
00:49:44,652 --> 00:49:46,788
Someone's living in my house.

925
00:49:48,422 --> 00:49:50,290
Oscorp doesn't exist.

926
00:49:52,159 --> 00:49:53,260
My son...

927
00:49:57,331 --> 00:50:00,568
Sometimes I'm not myself.

928
00:50:01,703 --> 00:50:04,204
I'm someone else.

929
00:50:04,338 --> 00:50:06,340
- Mm-hm.
- And every time he's in control,

930
00:50:06,473 --> 00:50:08,643
- I can't remember.
- Who? Who's in control?

931
00:50:08,776 --> 00:50:10,612
- And now I'm here...
- Who's in control?

932
00:50:10,745 --> 00:50:13,815
- I don't know what's going on.
- Okay, it's okay.

933
00:50:13,948 --> 00:50:17,652
And I don't...
Doesn't make sense.

934
00:50:17,785 --> 00:50:19,521
He's lost.

935
00:50:19,654 --> 00:50:23,625
And I don't mean just in
the cosmos. I mean in his mind.

936
00:50:26,226 --> 00:50:28,161
Are they all like this?

937
00:50:28,295 --> 00:50:29,329
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

938
00:50:29,463 --> 00:50:30,865
They all have their own

939
00:50:30,999 --> 00:50:32,800
mental or physical issues.

940
00:50:32,934 --> 00:50:36,638
Oh, well, he needs help
and maybe they all do.

941
00:50:36,771 --> 00:50:39,941
Wait, you don't mean...?
No, May, this isn't my problem.

942
00:50:40,073 --> 00:50:42,844
Peter, not your problem? Hmm?

943
00:50:42,977 --> 00:50:45,647
May. Their chance
of getting help is way better

944
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:47,615
back where they came from.

945
00:50:47,749 --> 00:50:49,283
Sending them home,

946
00:50:49,416 --> 00:50:51,351
that's the best thing
we can do for them.

947
00:50:51,485 --> 00:50:54,154
For them? Or for yourself?

948
00:50:56,824 --> 00:51:00,028
Look around you.
This is what we do.

949
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:04,933
- We help people.
- This is what's best for them.

950
00:51:05,065 --> 00:51:06,534
Trust me.

951
00:51:08,770 --> 00:51:13,240
<i>But the fact remains,
Spider-Man is a menace.</i>

952
00:51:13,373 --> 00:51:15,510
We'll be right back
after a brief word

953
00:51:15,643 --> 00:51:17,545
from <i>Daily Bugle</i> Supplements.

954
00:51:17,679 --> 00:51:20,414
The only other daily fix
you need.

955
00:51:20,548 --> 00:51:22,382
And we're out.

956
00:51:24,484 --> 00:51:25,485
What?

957
00:51:28,488 --> 00:51:29,757
I got eyes on him.

958
00:51:29,891 --> 00:51:31,425
<i>He's with his aunt
and some guy.</i>

959
00:51:31,559 --> 00:51:33,528
- You sure?
- <i>They're leaving the shelter.</i>

960
00:51:33,661 --> 00:51:35,329
Okay. Don't lose him.

961
00:51:45,974 --> 00:51:49,043
Thanks, May.
Hope to see you again.

962
00:51:49,176 --> 00:51:53,180
Hey. He trusts you. So do I.

963
00:51:55,282 --> 00:51:57,518
Thanks for cleaning my suit.

964
00:51:57,652 --> 00:51:59,053
I'll see you later.

965
00:52:01,154 --> 00:52:03,925
- Um, guys, this is Mr. Osborn.
- Hey, it's "doctor."

966
00:52:04,058 --> 00:52:06,226
Sorry. Um, Dr. Osborn,
these are my friends.

967
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:08,195
This is Ned and MJ.

968
00:52:08,328 --> 00:52:12,066
- Mary Jane?
- It's Michelle Jones, actually.

969
00:52:13,601 --> 00:52:15,268
Fascinating.

970
00:52:19,206 --> 00:52:21,375
Do you think
there are other Ned Leedses?

971
00:52:34,722 --> 00:52:36,090
Octavius?

972
00:52:40,094 --> 00:52:42,030
Osborn?

973
00:52:42,162 --> 00:52:46,100
- What... What happened to you?
- What happened to...?

974
00:52:46,233 --> 00:52:48,903
- You're the walking corpse.
- What do you mean?

975
00:52:49,037 --> 00:52:51,539
You died, Norman.

976
00:52:51,673 --> 00:52:53,306
Years ago.

977
00:52:54,274 --> 00:52:55,777
You're insane.

978
00:52:55,910 --> 00:52:58,946
- God, I love it here.
- What are you talking about?

979
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:00,782
He's standing right there.
He's not...

980
00:53:00,915 --> 00:53:03,718
Dead. They both died,

981
00:53:03,851 --> 00:53:05,820
fighting Spider-Man.

982
00:53:08,856 --> 00:53:11,159
It was all over the news.

983
00:53:11,291 --> 00:53:16,030
Green Goblin, impaled by
the glider you flew around on.

984
00:53:16,164 --> 00:53:20,434
And a couple of years later,
you, Doc Ock,

985
00:53:20,568 --> 00:53:22,335
drowned in the river
with your machine.

986
00:53:22,469 --> 00:53:24,505
That's nonsense.

987
00:53:24,639 --> 00:53:28,009
Spider-Man was trying
to stop my fusion reactor,

988
00:53:28,142 --> 00:53:29,844
so I stopped him.

989
00:53:29,977 --> 00:53:34,048
I had him by the throat,
and then I...

990
00:53:38,586 --> 00:53:41,055
- And then I was here.
- Ah, please.

991
00:53:41,189 --> 00:53:44,192
Let me tell you something.
I was whupping Spider-Man's ass.

992
00:53:44,324 --> 00:53:46,794
He'll tell you.
And then he caused an overload.

993
00:53:46,928 --> 00:53:49,097
I was stuck in the grid,
absorbing data.

994
00:53:49,229 --> 00:53:51,532
I was about to turn
into pure energy, and then...

995
00:53:51,666 --> 00:53:53,501
And then, uh...

996
00:53:53,634 --> 00:53:56,938
And then... Oh, shit.

997
00:53:57,071 --> 00:54:00,942
- I was about to die.
- Max, do you know? Do I die?

998
00:54:04,679 --> 00:54:06,547
Oh, great.
You caught another one.

999
00:54:06,681 --> 00:54:08,683
No, wait, Strange.
He's not dangerous.

1000
00:54:10,752 --> 00:54:12,653
It's okay. Um...

1001
00:54:14,822 --> 00:54:16,224
What is that?

1002
00:54:16,356 --> 00:54:18,926
It's an ancient relic.
The Macchina di Kadavus.

1003
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:20,528
I trapped
your corrupted spell inside,

1004
00:54:20,661 --> 00:54:22,429
and once I finish
the proper ritual,

1005
00:54:22,563 --> 00:54:23,865
it'll reverse the spell

1006
00:54:23,998 --> 00:54:26,567
and send these guys
back to their universes.

1007
00:54:26,701 --> 00:54:29,170
And then what? We perish?

1008
00:54:29,302 --> 00:54:30,938
No. No, thanks.
I'll pass on that.

1009
00:54:31,072 --> 00:54:34,542
Let me out of here. Peter!

1010
00:54:34,675 --> 00:54:38,880
Strange, we can't
send them back. Not yet.

1011
00:54:39,013 --> 00:54:41,215
Why?

1012
00:54:41,348 --> 00:54:43,584
Well, some of these guys
are gonna die.

1013
00:54:43,718 --> 00:54:47,255
Parker, it's their fate.

1014
00:54:48,321 --> 00:54:50,558
Come on, Strange, have a heart.

1015
00:54:51,993 --> 00:54:54,929
In the grand calculus
of the multiverse,

1016
00:54:55,062 --> 00:54:59,033
their sacrifice means infinitely
more than their lives.

1017
00:55:04,806 --> 00:55:06,941
I'm sorry, kid.

1018
00:55:07,074 --> 00:55:09,944
If they die, they die.

1019
00:55:23,423 --> 00:55:24,457
Peter!

1020
00:55:37,972 --> 00:55:38,906
Don't.

1021
00:55:41,809 --> 00:55:44,078
- Dude, what are you doing?
- Peter, you gotta go. Go, go.

1022
00:55:44,212 --> 00:55:45,780
- Okay.
- Get out of here.

1023
00:55:47,447 --> 00:55:49,951
This is why I never had kids.

1024
00:56:03,698 --> 00:56:05,432
- Give me the box.
- No.

1025
00:56:06,433 --> 00:56:07,501
Whoa!

1026
00:56:23,450 --> 00:56:25,620
- Oh, my God, I'm dead.
- You're not dead,

1027
00:56:25,753 --> 00:56:27,955
you've just been separated
from your physical form.

1028
00:56:28,089 --> 00:56:30,725
My physical... What?

1029
00:56:30,858 --> 00:56:33,794
- How are you doing that?
- I have no idea.

1030
00:56:33,928 --> 00:56:36,297
You should not
be able to do that.

1031
00:56:36,429 --> 00:56:38,299
This feels amazing.

1032
00:56:48,943 --> 00:56:50,845
That's one of the coolest
things that's happened to me,

1033
00:56:50,978 --> 00:56:52,513
but don't ever do that again.

1034
00:56:58,619 --> 00:57:00,487
Wha... Hey! Get off of me!

1035
00:57:26,981 --> 00:57:28,249
<i>♪ La, la ♪</i>

1036
00:57:28,382 --> 00:57:31,519
<i>♪ Tis the season
To be jolly... ♪</i>

1037
00:57:49,203 --> 00:57:51,439
- What is this place?
- The Mirror Dimension,

1038
00:57:51,572 --> 00:57:53,207
where I'm in control.

1039
00:58:02,316 --> 00:58:04,752
Strange, stop. Can we
please just talk about this?

1040
00:58:04,885 --> 00:58:07,855
Parker, don't you realize
that in the multiverse

1041
00:58:07,989 --> 00:58:10,191
there are an infinite number
of people

1042
00:58:10,324 --> 00:58:12,526
who know Peter Parker
is Spider-Man?

1043
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:15,463
And if that spell gets loose,
they're all coming here.

1044
00:58:15,596 --> 00:58:18,299
I know, I get it, but we can't
just send them home to die.

1045
00:58:18,432 --> 00:58:20,201
It's their fate.

1046
00:58:20,334 --> 00:58:21,602
You can't change that

1047
00:58:21,736 --> 00:58:23,738
any more than you could
change who they are.

1048
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:27,341
But what if we could? What if
we could change their fate?

1049
00:58:27,475 --> 00:58:29,844
Whoa! Oh, what are you doing?

1050
00:58:34,915 --> 00:58:36,817
I'm not giving you the... Whoa!

1051
00:58:38,052 --> 00:58:40,354
Whoa! Whoa!

1052
00:58:47,595 --> 00:58:49,196
Give me that back.

1053
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:11,986
Wait a minute.
Is that an Archimedean Spiral?

1054
00:59:12,119 --> 00:59:13,854
The Mirror Dimension
is just geometry?

1055
00:59:13,988 --> 00:59:16,290
You're great at geometry.
You can do geometry.

1056
00:59:18,125 --> 00:59:19,960
Square the radius.
Divide by pi.

1057
00:59:20,094 --> 00:59:23,030
- Plot points along the curve.
- It's over, Parker.

1058
00:59:23,164 --> 00:59:25,633
I'll come pick you up
when it's done.

1059
00:59:27,802 --> 00:59:29,570
Hey, Strange.

1060
00:59:29,703 --> 00:59:31,906
You know
what's cooler than magic?

1061
00:59:35,342 --> 00:59:37,711
- Math.
- Don't do this.

1062
00:59:40,549 --> 00:59:42,750
- Ow.
- I'm sorry, sir, but...

1063
00:59:47,188 --> 00:59:48,523
...I have to try.

1064
00:59:51,826 --> 00:59:54,095
- What happened?
- I fought with Strange and won.

1065
00:59:54,228 --> 00:59:56,997
- What?
- Look, I stole his ring thing.

1066
00:59:57,131 --> 00:59:59,900
I was swinging through the city,
and then I went through

1067
01:00:00,034 --> 01:00:01,802
this massive mirror thing,
and then I was back in...

1068
01:00:01,936 --> 01:00:03,637
- Where is he?
- He's trapped,

1069
01:00:03,771 --> 01:00:06,807
- but I'm not sure for how long.
- You could have left us to die.

1070
01:00:06,941 --> 01:00:08,342
Why didn't you?

1071
01:00:08,476 --> 01:00:10,010
Because that's not who he is.

1072
01:00:13,314 --> 01:00:15,316
I think I can help you guys.

1073
01:00:15,449 --> 01:00:18,152
If I can fix what happened
to you, then when you go back,

1074
01:00:18,285 --> 01:00:19,588
things will be different,

1075
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:21,689
and you might not die
fighting Spider-Man.

1076
01:00:21,822 --> 01:00:23,991
- What do you mean fix us?
- Our technology is advanced...

1077
01:00:24,125 --> 01:00:28,597
I can help you. You know, I'm
something of a scientist myself.

1078
01:00:30,565 --> 01:00:32,366
Octavius knows what I can do.

1079
01:00:32,501 --> 01:00:35,035
Fix? You mean like a dog?

1080
01:00:35,169 --> 01:00:36,437
I refuse.

1081
01:00:36,571 --> 01:00:38,439
I can't promise
you guys anything,

1082
01:00:38,573 --> 01:00:41,475
but at least this way, you get
to go home and have a chance.

1083
01:00:41,610 --> 01:00:43,310
A second chance.

1084
01:00:43,444 --> 01:00:45,246
Come on,
isn't that worth trying?

1085
01:00:45,379 --> 01:00:48,916
Trust me, Peter,
when you try to fix people,

1086
01:00:49,049 --> 01:00:51,752
there are always consequences.

1087
01:00:51,886 --> 01:00:53,622
I mean, you don't have to come.

1088
01:00:53,754 --> 01:00:55,656
I also didn't know
that you could talk.

1089
01:00:55,789 --> 01:00:57,158
But if you stay here,

1090
01:00:57,291 --> 01:00:59,059
you're gonna have to deal
with the wizard.

1091
01:00:59,193 --> 01:01:03,632
Ah, so we go along or die.
Not much of a choice, is it?

1092
01:01:03,764 --> 01:01:06,467
- I just wanna go home.
- Well, I, myself,

1093
01:01:06,601 --> 01:01:08,068
don't wanna be killed,

1094
01:01:08,202 --> 01:01:11,038
especially by a guy dressed
like Dungeons & Dragons,

1095
01:01:11,172 --> 01:01:12,607
so, what's your plan?

1096
01:01:14,008 --> 01:01:16,076
I have it all under control.

1097
01:01:19,013 --> 01:01:21,248
What are we
gonna do about this thing?

1098
01:01:21,382 --> 01:01:24,051
Uh, well, we need to find
somewhere safe for it, right?

1099
01:01:24,185 --> 01:01:26,120
- Yeah, sure. You gotta take it.
- Wait, what?

1100
01:01:26,253 --> 01:01:28,557
If something bad happens,
you just push this,

1101
01:01:28,689 --> 01:01:31,425
- and then it's all over.
- We're not gonna leave you.

1102
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:33,794
You can't. It's dangerous.
You've done enough.

1103
01:01:33,928 --> 01:01:36,197
- We're in this together.
- I know we're in this together,

1104
01:01:36,330 --> 01:01:38,465
but I can't do this
if you're in danger.

1105
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:41,435
Okay? So for me, MJ,
please just take this.

1106
01:01:44,305 --> 01:01:46,641
- Please.
- Fine.

1107
01:01:46,774 --> 01:01:48,175
- Thank you.
- But, Peter,

1108
01:01:48,309 --> 01:01:50,612
if I don't hear from you,
I'm pressing the button.

1109
01:01:50,744 --> 01:01:54,048
- Sure.
- Okay. And I will do it.

1110
01:01:54,181 --> 01:01:55,816
Yeah, we all believe you,
Michelle.

1111
01:01:55,950 --> 01:01:58,819
No way that's his girlfriend.
No way.

1112
01:01:58,953 --> 01:02:02,823
- She'll do it.
- Absolutely, she will.

1113
01:02:02,957 --> 01:02:05,793
- Okay. See you later.
- Be safe.

1114
01:02:05,926 --> 01:02:07,294
- You too.
- Okay.

1115
01:02:08,996 --> 01:02:10,431
Whoa.

1116
01:02:11,332 --> 01:02:12,534
Okay.

1117
01:02:14,468 --> 01:02:16,203
- Be careful, okay?
- Yeah. You too.

1118
01:02:23,911 --> 01:02:25,279
So, uh...

1119
01:02:26,347 --> 01:02:28,115
who's coming with me?

1120
01:02:31,952 --> 01:02:33,320
Well, I'm in.

1121
01:02:33,454 --> 01:02:36,890
But if this goes sideways...

1122
01:02:37,024 --> 01:02:39,661
I'm gonna fry you
from the inside out.

1123
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:52,873
<i>Where's Connors?</i>

1124
01:02:53,007 --> 01:02:54,576
<i>He wants to stay in the truck.</i>

1125
01:02:54,709 --> 01:02:56,210
<i>Okay.</i>

1126
01:02:56,343 --> 01:02:58,279
<i>Alarm system deactivated.</i>

1127
01:02:58,412 --> 01:03:00,180
Hey, May.

1128
01:03:00,314 --> 01:03:01,915
- Yeah?
- I feel kind of bad

1129
01:03:02,049 --> 01:03:05,219
- using Happy's place like this.
- No, no, no. He'll get over it.

1130
01:03:06,554 --> 01:03:08,022
<i>New Yorkers</i>

1131
01:03:08,155 --> 01:03:10,991
- <i>oppose the renovation...</i>
- Oh, sorry.

1132
01:03:11,125 --> 01:03:14,495
So this is your plan, Peter, hm?
No lab, no facilities?

1133
01:03:14,629 --> 01:03:17,264
Just performing miracles
in a condominium, hm?

1134
01:03:17,398 --> 01:03:18,899
What, you gonna cook us
some cures

1135
01:03:19,033 --> 01:03:20,834
and some frozen burritos
in a microwave?

1136
01:03:20,968 --> 01:03:23,705
- I could go for a burrito.
- He's gonna kill us all.

1137
01:03:23,837 --> 01:03:25,740
Well, let's hope not.

1138
01:03:25,873 --> 01:03:27,941
- You're up first, Doc.
- What?

1139
01:03:28,075 --> 01:03:30,344
Hey, I told you,
I don't need fixing.

1140
01:03:30,477 --> 01:03:32,446
I don't need fixing.

1141
01:03:32,580 --> 01:03:35,115
Especially by a teenager
using scraps

1142
01:03:35,249 --> 01:03:36,785
from a bachelor's junk drawer.

1143
01:03:36,917 --> 01:03:39,987
Nah, nah, nah.
He got something back there.

1144
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:42,557
I can feel it.
That weird energy.

1145
01:03:43,957 --> 01:03:45,092
What the hell is that?

1146
01:03:45,225 --> 01:03:46,960
It's a fabricator.

1147
01:03:47,094 --> 01:03:51,465
It can analyze, design,
construct basically anything.

1148
01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:53,802
I thought that was
the tanning bed Happy broke.

1149
01:03:56,705 --> 01:03:57,806
Look at that.

1150
01:04:05,145 --> 01:04:06,681
He's gonna kill us all.

1151
01:04:14,789 --> 01:04:17,224
Whoa. What's going on there?

1152
01:04:17,358 --> 01:04:19,627
So the chip in
the back of Doc's neck

1153
01:04:19,761 --> 01:04:22,062
was designed to protect
his brain from the AI system

1154
01:04:22,196 --> 01:04:23,631
that's controlling
these tentacles,

1155
01:04:23,765 --> 01:04:27,802
but if you look here...
the chip is fried.

1156
01:04:27,935 --> 01:04:30,437
So rather than him being
in control of the tentacles,

1157
01:04:30,572 --> 01:04:32,507
the tentacles are now
in control of him.

1158
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:37,779
Which, I guess, explains why
he is so miserable all the time.

1159
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:47,388
Thirsty?

1160
01:04:50,257 --> 01:04:52,326
Well, yes, I am thirsty.

1161
01:04:52,459 --> 01:04:54,729
Fresh water or salt?

1162
01:04:54,863 --> 01:04:56,897
You know,
because you're an octopus.

1163
01:04:58,600 --> 01:04:59,834
What?

1164
01:05:01,168 --> 01:05:02,637
Fresh water it is.

1165
01:05:03,671 --> 01:05:05,573
Look at this place.

1166
01:05:05,707 --> 01:05:08,877
- And all the possibilities.
- What, this condo?

1167
01:05:09,009 --> 01:05:12,045
Yeah, yeah, the condo. I love
the whole open floor plan. No.

1168
01:05:12,179 --> 01:05:15,182
No, man,
I'm talking about the world.

1169
01:05:15,315 --> 01:05:17,619
I kind of like who I am here.

1170
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:21,790
And all that power back there...

1171
01:05:21,922 --> 01:05:23,858
I could be so much more.

1172
01:05:23,991 --> 01:05:25,727
So why'd you come along?

1173
01:05:25,860 --> 01:05:28,730
I have a daughter,
and I want to see her.

1174
01:05:28,863 --> 01:05:30,964
But he's not gonna
send anyone home

1175
01:05:31,098 --> 01:05:34,334
till he's finished his little
science project back there.

1176
01:05:34,468 --> 01:05:35,670
You trust him?

1177
01:05:35,804 --> 01:05:37,337
I don't trust anyone.

1178
01:05:38,506 --> 01:05:40,040
How'd you end up
like that anyway?

1179
01:05:40,174 --> 01:05:41,910
Oh...

1180
01:05:42,042 --> 01:05:43,778
the place where I worked at,

1181
01:05:43,912 --> 01:05:46,280
they were experimenting
with electricity

1182
01:05:46,413 --> 01:05:49,517
created by living organisms,
and then, uh...

1183
01:05:49,651 --> 01:05:51,853
I fell into
a vat of electric eels.

1184
01:05:51,985 --> 01:05:54,923
You're kidding.
I fell into a supercollider.

1185
01:05:55,055 --> 01:05:56,791
Damn.

1186
01:05:56,925 --> 01:05:58,760
Gotta be careful
where you fall.

1187
01:05:59,694 --> 01:06:01,295
Remarkable.

1188
01:06:02,831 --> 01:06:05,265
The technology and you.

1189
01:06:07,569 --> 01:06:10,738
When all this is over,
if you need a job

1190
01:06:10,872 --> 01:06:15,577
and you're willing to commute
to another universe...

1191
01:06:20,815 --> 01:06:23,685
It worked. That totally worked.

1192
01:06:23,818 --> 01:06:26,220
I got it. I did it.
Uh, will you send him up?

1193
01:06:26,353 --> 01:06:27,722
Here we go.

1194
01:06:28,756 --> 01:06:30,190
- Sorry.
- Hold on, Doc.

1195
01:06:30,324 --> 01:06:32,894
Oh, will these humiliations
never cease?

1196
01:06:33,026 --> 01:06:35,930
You, keep your science fair
project away from me!

1197
01:06:36,063 --> 01:06:37,632
It'll work. Have faith.

1198
01:06:37,765 --> 01:06:40,735
Says the reckless fool who
turned himself into a monster.

1199
01:06:42,002 --> 01:06:43,905
Please stop moving your head.

1200
01:06:44,037 --> 01:06:46,508
- Hold still.
- Don't you dare.

1201
01:06:51,411 --> 01:06:53,781
Ugh! I swear,
when I get out of this,

1202
01:06:53,915 --> 01:06:56,283
we're gonna rip you a new...

1203
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:01,488
Doc?

1204
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:08,295
Doc?

1205
01:07:09,998 --> 01:07:11,265
Doc?

1206
01:07:12,232 --> 01:07:13,902
Dr. Octav...

1207
01:07:20,140 --> 01:07:21,743
It's so quiet.

1208
01:07:25,212 --> 01:07:28,583
Those voices inside my head...

1209
01:07:33,453 --> 01:07:34,956
I'd almost forgotten.

1210
01:07:36,256 --> 01:07:37,424
Otto.

1211
01:07:38,593 --> 01:07:40,662
Yes. Norman.

1212
01:07:46,668 --> 01:07:47,969
It's me.

1213
01:07:50,137 --> 01:07:51,539
Would you look at that.

1214
01:08:12,026 --> 01:08:15,162
I'm grateful, dear boy. Truly.

1215
01:08:15,295 --> 01:08:17,297
Yeah, you're welcome.

1216
01:08:17,431 --> 01:08:19,067
How can I help?

1217
01:08:19,199 --> 01:08:21,301
<i>This is Peter. Leave a message.</i>

1218
01:08:21,435 --> 01:08:24,005
Uh, yeah, Peter, this is Happy.

1219
01:08:24,137 --> 01:08:25,807
I accessed my doorbell camera.

1220
01:08:25,940 --> 01:08:28,076
Who are those guys, huh?
Is that a cyborg?

1221
01:08:28,208 --> 01:08:30,545
You bring a cyborg
with robot legs into my house?

1222
01:08:30,678 --> 01:08:33,246
Was one of the guys made of mud?
What's going on? Call me.

1223
01:08:42,389 --> 01:08:44,424
How does it feel, Norman?

1224
01:08:44,559 --> 01:08:47,028
You're about
to become whole again.

1225
01:08:48,195 --> 01:08:50,732
No more darker half.

1226
01:08:50,865 --> 01:08:51,966
Just you.

1227
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:54,368
Just me.

1228
01:09:03,377 --> 01:09:04,545
Okay, um...

1229
01:09:06,047 --> 01:09:09,149
It just goes right here. This...

1230
01:09:09,282 --> 01:09:10,785
That should be
drawing power now.

1231
01:09:10,918 --> 01:09:12,787
I'm gonna come back
in a second to check,

1232
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:15,089
but keep an eye on the lights.
When they're all green,

1233
01:09:15,222 --> 01:09:17,592
it means the electricity
in your body's dissipated.

1234
01:09:17,725 --> 01:09:19,060
Well, not all
of the electricity.

1235
01:09:19,226 --> 01:09:21,428
You need electricity
for your brain to function.

1236
01:09:21,562 --> 01:09:23,430
Your nervous system is...

1237
01:09:23,564 --> 01:09:26,601
I'm not really sure why I'm
explaining electricity to you.

1238
01:09:26,734 --> 01:09:28,636
- Yeah, can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

1239
01:09:28,770 --> 01:09:31,139
Are these your Legos?

1240
01:09:32,172 --> 01:09:34,642
Uh, I gotta go. I'll be back.

1241
01:09:40,114 --> 01:09:43,483
- Something feels off.
- What do you mean?

1242
01:09:43,618 --> 01:09:46,087
- I don't like this.
- Leave it alone.

1243
01:09:46,219 --> 01:09:49,857
The sooner you guys get through
this, the sooner we go home.

1244
01:09:57,899 --> 01:10:00,134
- Well, where is he?
- Uh, he's inside.

1245
01:10:00,267 --> 01:10:01,869
And yet here we are, outside.

1246
01:10:02,003 --> 01:10:03,971
Did you not hear me say,
"Don't lose him?"

1247
01:10:04,105 --> 01:10:06,107
I want incriminating footage
of Spider-Man.

1248
01:10:06,239 --> 01:10:08,009
I called Damage Control.
They're on their way.

1249
01:10:08,142 --> 01:10:09,711
And so it begins.

1250
01:10:09,844 --> 01:10:11,713
...place is about
to be swarming with cops.

1251
01:10:30,798 --> 01:10:32,133
Peter?

1252
01:10:33,568 --> 01:10:34,802
What's wrong?

1253
01:10:35,803 --> 01:10:37,672
I don't know.

1254
01:10:37,805 --> 01:10:38,873
May?

1255
01:10:44,478 --> 01:10:45,980
What is it, Peter?

1256
01:10:53,054 --> 01:10:54,589
What's happening?

1257
01:11:01,328 --> 01:11:03,531
Why are you
looking at me like that?

1258
01:11:18,679 --> 01:11:23,383
That's some neat trick,
that sense of yours.

1259
01:11:23,518 --> 01:11:27,655
- Norman?
- Norman's on sabbatical, honey.

1260
01:11:27,789 --> 01:11:30,057
- The hell?
- The Goblin.

1261
01:11:31,291 --> 01:11:33,194
"No more darker half"?

1262
01:11:33,326 --> 01:11:36,731
Did you really think
that I'd let that happen?

1263
01:11:36,864 --> 01:11:40,268
That I'd let you take away my
power just because you're blind

1264
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:42,937
to what true power
can bring you?

1265
01:11:43,070 --> 01:11:44,605
- You don't know me.
- Don't I?

1266
01:11:48,375 --> 01:11:53,915
I saw how she trapped you,
fighting her holy moral mission.

1267
01:11:56,584 --> 01:11:58,719
We don't need you to save us.

1268
01:11:58,853 --> 01:12:00,955
We don't need to be fixed.

1269
01:12:04,424 --> 01:12:07,161
These are not curses.

1270
01:12:07,295 --> 01:12:09,462
They're gifts.

1271
01:12:10,765 --> 01:12:12,733
- Norman, no.
- Quiet, lapdog.

1272
01:12:12,867 --> 01:12:14,735
You don't know
what you're talking about.

1273
01:12:14,869 --> 01:12:19,807
I've watched you from deep
behind Norman's cowardly eyes.

1274
01:12:19,941 --> 01:12:25,279
Struggling to have
everything you want

1275
01:12:25,412 --> 01:12:28,916
while the world tries
to make you choose.

1276
01:12:31,118 --> 01:12:34,655
Gods don't have to choose.

1277
01:12:36,524 --> 01:12:37,925
We take.

1278
01:12:38,059 --> 01:12:39,492
May, run.

1279
01:13:02,783 --> 01:13:04,652
Oh, my God.

1280
01:13:04,785 --> 01:13:07,989
- What have you done?
- I liked you better before.

1281
01:13:17,331 --> 01:13:20,902
Up here. He's up there.
It's the guy from the bridge.

1282
01:13:43,257 --> 01:13:44,392
Did you see that?

1283
01:14:10,918 --> 01:14:12,620
No, you don't!

1284
01:14:21,395 --> 01:14:23,798
Strong enough to have it all.

1285
01:14:27,101 --> 01:14:29,070
Too weak to take it!

1286
01:15:04,105 --> 01:15:05,473
Now I got you.

1287
01:15:07,708 --> 01:15:09,944
I told you
there'd be consequences.

1288
01:15:28,162 --> 01:15:32,033
Your weakness, Peter,
is morality.

1289
01:15:32,166 --> 01:15:36,137
It's choking you.
Can't you feel it?

1290
01:15:44,412 --> 01:15:45,746
It didn't work.

1291
01:15:47,114 --> 01:15:48,682
Norman was right.

1292
01:15:48,816 --> 01:15:52,620
He got it from you,
that pathetic sickness.

1293
01:15:57,258 --> 01:15:59,660
You tried to fix me.

1294
01:15:59,794 --> 01:16:03,431
- May, go.
- Now I'm gonna fix you.

1295
01:16:07,034 --> 01:16:08,402
May, run, please.

1296
01:16:11,540 --> 01:16:13,407
May!

1297
01:16:19,647 --> 01:16:21,749
Peter, Peter, Peter.

1298
01:16:21,882 --> 01:16:25,386
No good deed goes unpunished.

1299
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:27,755
You can thank me later.

1300
01:16:33,627 --> 01:16:34,962
No!

1301
01:17:04,692 --> 01:17:05,560
- May?
- Peter.

1302
01:17:05,693 --> 01:17:07,461
May, May, I'm here.

1303
01:17:07,596 --> 01:17:09,531
Oh!

1304
01:17:10,998 --> 01:17:12,366
- May.
- Oh!

1305
01:17:12,501 --> 01:17:14,368
May, I'm here.

1306
01:17:14,503 --> 01:17:16,103
- Are you okay?
- Uh-huh, uh-huh.

1307
01:17:16,237 --> 01:17:17,438
What happened?

1308
01:17:20,575 --> 01:17:21,610
Okay... Oh!

1309
01:17:23,244 --> 01:17:25,212
It's okay. We're okay, right?

1310
01:17:25,346 --> 01:17:26,981
Yeah. Knocked on my ass.

1311
01:17:27,114 --> 01:17:28,215
- Yeah, me too.
- That's all.

1312
01:17:30,718 --> 01:17:32,052
I think I broke my ribs.

1313
01:17:37,358 --> 01:17:39,460
- This is all my fault, May.
- No.

1314
01:17:39,594 --> 01:17:41,495
I should have let Strange
send them back.

1315
01:17:41,630 --> 01:17:43,497
You did the right thing.

1316
01:17:43,632 --> 01:17:45,399
They would have been killed.

1317
01:17:45,534 --> 01:17:47,301
You did the right thing.

1318
01:17:47,434 --> 01:17:49,937
It's not my responsibility, May.

1319
01:17:51,772 --> 01:17:54,308
Oh. What Norman said?

1320
01:17:55,644 --> 01:17:57,579
My moral mission? No.

1321
01:17:57,711 --> 01:17:59,980
- No, May...
- Peter, you listen to me.

1322
01:18:01,148 --> 01:18:02,249
You have a gift.

1323
01:18:03,751 --> 01:18:05,853
You have power.

1324
01:18:05,986 --> 01:18:07,354
And with great power,

1325
01:18:07,488 --> 01:18:11,560
there must also come
great responsibility, mm?

1326
01:18:16,230 --> 01:18:17,666
Yeah, I know.

1327
01:18:17,798 --> 01:18:19,466
Let's get the... out of here.

1328
01:18:19,601 --> 01:18:21,268
Okay, let's go.

1329
01:18:21,402 --> 01:18:24,071
Let me just catch my...

1330
01:18:39,453 --> 01:18:41,656
- What happened? Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

1331
01:18:41,789 --> 01:18:43,625
Yeah, you're okay.
What happened?

1332
01:18:45,392 --> 01:18:47,461
Just have to...

1333
01:18:47,596 --> 01:18:49,763
- catch my breath.
- Okay, well, catch your breath.

1334
01:18:49,897 --> 01:18:51,799
I'm right here.
We're gonna take our time.

1335
01:18:51,932 --> 01:18:53,167
You catch your breath.

1336
01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:55,670
Then we'll take you
to a doctor, okay?

1337
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:15,256
Are you okay?

1338
01:19:15,389 --> 01:19:18,225
Somebody help! I need
an ambulance, please! Somebody?

1339
01:19:18,359 --> 01:19:21,262
- What happened?
- Nothing happened.

1340
01:19:21,395 --> 01:19:23,097
You're okay, you're okay.

1341
01:19:24,798 --> 01:19:27,201
Let me just...
Let me catch my breath.

1342
01:19:27,334 --> 01:19:29,671
I'm right here. I'm right here.

1343
01:19:29,803 --> 01:19:31,405
I'm right here.

1344
01:19:37,845 --> 01:19:39,246
You're okay.

1345
01:19:40,515 --> 01:19:42,049
It's just me and you.

1346
01:19:51,825 --> 01:19:53,060
May?

1347
01:19:59,266 --> 01:20:00,602
May?

1348
01:20:06,541 --> 01:20:08,475
Will you look at me,
May, please?

1349
01:20:16,751 --> 01:20:17,918
May.

1350
01:20:18,852 --> 01:20:20,054
May.

1351
01:20:21,255 --> 01:20:22,856
What are you doing, May?

1352
01:20:22,990 --> 01:20:25,694
Please, will you just wake up
and talk to me? Please?

1353
01:20:48,550 --> 01:20:50,317
Get out of the car now! Move!

1354
01:20:56,791 --> 01:20:58,560
Get off, get off, get off me.

1355
01:21:00,829 --> 01:21:03,464
- Peter! Run!
- It's just me and you, okay?

1356
01:21:03,598 --> 01:21:05,432
It's just me and you, okay?

1357
01:21:05,567 --> 01:21:08,503
Oh, May, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

1358
01:21:08,636 --> 01:21:10,672
I'm so, so, so sorry.
I love you.

1359
01:21:10,805 --> 01:21:13,307
All right, Parker!
Come out with your hands up!

1360
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:15,943
Come out right
now, or we will open fire!

1361
01:21:16,076 --> 01:21:17,878
Run!

1362
01:21:20,914 --> 01:21:23,685
All right, let's go.
Let's go! Move in!

1363
01:21:41,268 --> 01:21:42,837
<i>Tragedy.</i>

1364
01:21:46,173 --> 01:21:48,576
<i>What else can I call it?</i>

1365
01:21:48,710 --> 01:21:50,678
<i>What more need be said?</i>

1366
01:21:50,812 --> 01:21:54,883
<i>The damage, the destruction.</i>

1367
01:21:55,015 --> 01:21:57,585
<i>You saw it with your own eyes.</i>

1368
01:21:57,719 --> 01:22:00,588
<i>When will people wake up
and realize</i>

1369
01:22:00,722 --> 01:22:03,257
<i>that everywhere
Spider-Man goes,</i>

1370
01:22:03,390 --> 01:22:06,960
<i>chaos and calamity ensue?</i>

1371
01:22:07,094 --> 01:22:12,166
<i>Everything Spider-Man touches
comes to ruin.</i>

1372
01:22:12,299 --> 01:22:14,836
<i>And we, the innocents,</i>

1373
01:22:14,968 --> 01:22:17,404
<i>are left to pick up the pieces.</i>

1374
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:21,509
<i>J. Jonah Jameson reporting.</i>

1375
01:22:21,643 --> 01:22:24,913
<i>Good night,
and God help us all.</i>

1376
01:22:44,364 --> 01:22:47,502
<i>We are told that multiple
people have been injured,</i>

1377
01:22:47,635 --> 01:22:52,072
<i>and we can confirm at least
one person has been killed...</i>

1378
01:22:52,206 --> 01:22:53,708
Still nothing?

1379
01:22:54,909 --> 01:22:56,343
No.

1380
01:23:11,893 --> 01:23:13,393
I'm gonna press it.

1381
01:23:14,863 --> 01:23:17,565
- What? No, he...
- I know he told me to wait...

1382
01:23:18,900 --> 01:23:21,068
- but I'm gonna do it.
- I just wish...

1383
01:23:21,201 --> 01:23:22,904
I just wish we could see him.

1384
01:23:28,108 --> 01:23:30,077
- Ned?
- Yeah?

1385
01:23:30,210 --> 01:23:32,246
- Do that again.
- Yeah.

1386
01:23:34,147 --> 01:23:36,316
I just wish we could see him.

1387
01:23:38,285 --> 01:23:40,788
Oh. Okay.

1388
01:23:40,922 --> 01:23:43,290
I just wish we could see Peter.

1389
01:23:46,661 --> 01:23:49,429
Whoa.

1390
01:23:49,564 --> 01:23:52,499
<i>Lola,</i> you're right. I am magic.

1391
01:23:52,634 --> 01:23:54,368
Is that him?

1392
01:23:54,502 --> 01:23:56,838
- Yeah, yeah, it has to be.
- Peter. Peter!

1393
01:23:56,971 --> 01:23:58,506
- Hey, Peter!
- Peter!

1394
01:23:58,640 --> 01:24:00,107
Yeah.

1395
01:24:04,411 --> 01:24:05,312
Whoa!

1396
01:24:07,447 --> 01:24:08,950
Hi. Hi.

1397
01:24:09,082 --> 01:24:12,119
No, no, no, it's okay.
It's okay. I'm a nice guy.

1398
01:24:14,856 --> 01:24:16,290
Okay.

1399
01:24:18,793 --> 01:24:21,328
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm Peter Parker.

1400
01:24:21,461 --> 01:24:25,533
- That's not possible.
- I am Spider-Man, in my world.

1401
01:24:25,667 --> 01:24:28,836
But then yesterday, I was...

1402
01:24:30,505 --> 01:24:32,372
I was just here.

1403
01:24:33,908 --> 01:24:35,175
Wow.

1404
01:24:36,778 --> 01:24:41,348
String theory,
multi-dimensional reality...

1405
01:24:41,481 --> 01:24:43,685
and matter displacement.

1406
01:24:43,818 --> 01:24:45,653
- All real?
- Yeah.

1407
01:24:45,787 --> 01:24:47,387
I knew it.

1408
01:24:48,690 --> 01:24:50,992
This has to be
because of the spell.

1409
01:24:51,124 --> 01:24:52,827
The spell? Like magic spell?

1410
01:24:52,961 --> 01:24:54,796
- There's no spell. No.
- No spell.

1411
01:24:54,929 --> 01:24:56,631
- Magic's real here too?
- I mean...

1412
01:24:56,764 --> 01:24:58,533
- Shut up, Ned.
- No, it's not <i>real.</i>

1413
01:24:58,666 --> 01:25:01,736
- Shut up. Stop talking.
- There's magicians, but no...

1414
01:25:01,869 --> 01:25:04,204
Stop. Stop.

1415
01:25:04,338 --> 01:25:05,640
- Prove it.
- Prove what?

1416
01:25:05,773 --> 01:25:07,742
- That you're Peter Parker.
- I don't carry

1417
01:25:07,875 --> 01:25:09,409
an ID with me, you know?

1418
01:25:09,544 --> 01:25:12,312
Kind of defeats the whole
anonymous superhero thing.

1419
01:25:14,348 --> 01:25:16,416
- Why'd you do that?
- To see if you have the tingle.

1420
01:25:16,551 --> 01:25:18,485
I have the tingle thing,
just not for bread.

1421
01:25:18,620 --> 01:25:20,555
Can you not
throw the bread again?

1422
01:25:20,688 --> 01:25:23,390
You're a deeply
mistrusting person...

1423
01:25:24,659 --> 01:25:26,259
and I respect it.

1424
01:25:31,231 --> 01:25:32,100
Crawl around.

1425
01:25:32,232 --> 01:25:34,102
- Crawl around?
- Yes.

1426
01:25:34,234 --> 01:25:35,803
- No.
- Yes, crawl around.

1427
01:25:35,937 --> 01:25:37,471
- Why do I need to?
- This is not enough.

1428
01:25:37,605 --> 01:25:38,906
- This is plenty.
- No, it's not.

1429
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:40,642
- Yes, it is. It is.
- No, it's not. Nuh-uh.

1430
01:25:40,775 --> 01:25:43,410
- How do I stick to the ceiling?
- Do it.

1431
01:25:44,712 --> 01:25:45,980
Ned.

1432
01:25:51,619 --> 01:25:53,387
My <i>lola's</i> asking
if you could just

1433
01:25:53,521 --> 01:25:54,989
get the cobweb there.

1434
01:25:55,123 --> 01:25:57,391
- Since you're, like, up there.
- Yeah.

1435
01:26:05,033 --> 01:26:06,668
Thank you.

1436
01:26:10,772 --> 01:26:12,106
We goo...?

1437
01:26:12,239 --> 01:26:14,676
- We good?
- For now.

1438
01:26:14,809 --> 01:26:17,745
So I opened the wrong portal
to the wrong Peter Parker.

1439
01:26:17,879 --> 01:26:20,114
I guess you keep doing it
until we find the real one.

1440
01:26:20,247 --> 01:26:22,684
- Ouch.
- No offense.

1441
01:26:22,817 --> 01:26:24,652
- Okay.
- Okay. You got it.

1442
01:26:26,721 --> 01:26:28,056
Find Peter Parker.

1443
01:26:28,188 --> 01:26:30,158
- What's the thing on his hand?
- Shh.

1444
01:26:30,290 --> 01:26:32,593
Find Peter Parker.

1445
01:26:34,327 --> 01:26:36,296
Find Peter Parker!

1446
01:26:45,238 --> 01:26:47,441
Great, it's just
some random guy.

1447
01:26:47,575 --> 01:26:48,776
Hello.

1448
01:26:48,910 --> 01:26:50,243
Um, I hope it's okay,

1449
01:26:50,377 --> 01:26:52,345
I just came through this, uh...

1450
01:26:52,479 --> 01:26:54,481
Oh. It just closed.

1451
01:26:55,950 --> 01:26:57,151
You're Peter?

1452
01:26:57,284 --> 01:27:00,320
Yeah. Peter Parker.

1453
01:27:02,389 --> 01:27:04,125
I... I've seen you two...

1454
01:27:06,493 --> 01:27:07,862
Hi. Heh.

1455
01:27:11,599 --> 01:27:14,301
Wait. He's...
He's not <i>your</i> friend.

1456
01:27:26,914 --> 01:27:29,984
Huh.

1457
01:27:30,118 --> 01:27:33,187
Wait. So you're Spider-Man too?
Why didn't you just say that?

1458
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:35,723
I generally don't
go around advertising it.

1459
01:27:35,857 --> 01:27:38,526
Kind of defeats the whole
anonymous superhero thing.

1460
01:27:38,659 --> 01:27:40,360
- I said that.
- That's what he just said.

1461
01:27:52,240 --> 01:27:55,743
My <i>lola's</i> asking if you could
clean up the webs you just shot.

1462
01:27:55,877 --> 01:27:57,545
- Oh, sorry, <i>Lola.</i>
- Yes, of course.

1463
01:27:57,678 --> 01:27:59,914
- I'm going to bed.
- Night, <i>Lola.</i>

1464
01:28:00,047 --> 01:28:01,849
Good night, Ned's <i>lola.</i>

1465
01:28:01,983 --> 01:28:04,752
Uh,
this might seem kind of weird,

1466
01:28:04,886 --> 01:28:06,721
but I've been trying
to find your friend

1467
01:28:06,854 --> 01:28:08,890
ever since I got here.

1468
01:28:09,023 --> 01:28:11,125
I just have this sense that...

1469
01:28:12,894 --> 01:28:14,128
That he needs my help.

1470
01:28:14,262 --> 01:28:15,797
Our help.

1471
01:28:17,231 --> 01:28:18,266
He does.

1472
01:28:18,398 --> 01:28:20,067
We don't know where he is.

1473
01:28:20,201 --> 01:28:25,606
And, um, honestly, right now
we're all he really has left.

1474
01:28:25,740 --> 01:28:30,745
Well, uh, is there someplace
that he might go

1475
01:28:30,878 --> 01:28:33,281
that has meaning to him?

1476
01:28:34,515 --> 01:28:37,952
Like a place
where he would go to just...?

1477
01:28:38,085 --> 01:28:40,021
Get away from everything?

1478
01:28:42,690 --> 01:28:45,893
For me, it was the top
of the Chrysler Building.

1479
01:28:46,027 --> 01:28:47,895
Empire State.

1480
01:28:48,029 --> 01:28:51,065
- It's a better view.
- That is a sweet view.

1481
01:28:53,333 --> 01:28:55,136
Yes.

1482
01:28:55,269 --> 01:28:58,706
Yeah. I... I think I know
exactly where that would be.

1483
01:29:34,441 --> 01:29:35,776
I'm sorry.

1484
01:29:42,950 --> 01:29:44,451
Peter, there's...

1485
01:29:45,620 --> 01:29:47,521
There's some people here.

1486
01:29:48,656 --> 01:29:50,490
- What?
- Um...

1487
01:29:59,166 --> 01:30:01,002
Hey, wait, wait! Whoa!

1488
01:30:01,135 --> 01:30:02,203
What...?

1489
01:30:05,039 --> 01:30:06,073
Sorry...

1490
01:30:07,942 --> 01:30:08,976
about May.

1491
01:30:12,613 --> 01:30:14,916
Yeah. Sorry.

1492
01:30:16,684 --> 01:30:18,686
I got some understanding
of what it is you're...

1493
01:30:18,819 --> 01:30:22,056
No, please don't tell me that
you know what I'm going through.

1494
01:30:22,189 --> 01:30:24,491
- Okay.
- She's gone.

1495
01:30:26,994 --> 01:30:28,396
And it's all my fault.

1496
01:30:32,566 --> 01:30:34,201
She died for nothing.

1497
01:30:37,772 --> 01:30:40,241
So I'm gonna do what I should
have done in the first place.

1498
01:30:40,374 --> 01:30:42,009
- Peter...
- Please don't.

1499
01:30:43,044 --> 01:30:44,145
You don't belong here.

1500
01:30:44,278 --> 01:30:45,212
Either of you.

1501
01:30:45,346 --> 01:30:47,748
So I'm sending you home.

1502
01:30:47,882 --> 01:30:50,851
Those other guys
are from your worlds, right?

1503
01:30:50,985 --> 01:30:52,420
So you deal with it.

1504
01:30:52,553 --> 01:30:55,189
If they die, if you kill them...

1505
01:30:55,323 --> 01:30:56,357
that's on you.

1506
01:30:57,490 --> 01:30:59,193
It's not my problem.

1507
01:30:59,327 --> 01:31:00,761
I don't care anymore.

1508
01:31:01,963 --> 01:31:03,230
I'm done.

1509
01:31:07,835 --> 01:31:10,504
I'm really sorry
that I dragged you into this.

1510
01:31:13,808 --> 01:31:15,776
But you have to go home now.

1511
01:31:18,012 --> 01:31:19,246
Good luck.

1512
01:31:24,552 --> 01:31:26,554
My Uncle Ben was killed.

1513
01:31:27,989 --> 01:31:29,357
It was my fault.

1514
01:31:30,591 --> 01:31:32,026
I lost...

1515
01:31:34,695 --> 01:31:36,731
I lost Gwen, my, um...

1516
01:31:38,032 --> 01:31:39,800
She was my MJ.

1517
01:31:41,902 --> 01:31:43,437
I couldn't save her.

1518
01:31:45,072 --> 01:31:47,808
I'm never gonna be able
to forgive myself for that.

1519
01:31:50,244 --> 01:31:52,580
But I carried on,
tried to, um...

1520
01:31:52,713 --> 01:31:55,916
Tried to keep going,
tried to keep being the, uh...

1521
01:31:57,385 --> 01:31:59,186
The friendly neighborhood
Spider-Man

1522
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:02,189
'cause I know that's what
she would've wanted.

1523
01:32:02,323 --> 01:32:05,993
But at some point, I just...
I stopped pulling my punches.

1524
01:32:09,597 --> 01:32:11,098
I got rageful.

1525
01:32:13,234 --> 01:32:14,602
I got bitter.

1526
01:32:15,936 --> 01:32:17,471
I just don't want you

1527
01:32:17,605 --> 01:32:20,307
to end up like... Like me.

1528
01:32:21,776 --> 01:32:24,712
The night Ben died...

1529
01:32:24,845 --> 01:32:27,548
I hunted down the man
who I thought did it.

1530
01:32:29,350 --> 01:32:31,118
I wanted him dead.

1531
01:32:33,587 --> 01:32:35,122
I got what I wanted.

1532
01:32:37,491 --> 01:32:39,528
It didn't make it better.

1533
01:32:43,064 --> 01:32:45,534
It took me a long time...

1534
01:32:47,301 --> 01:32:49,703
to learn to get through
that darkness.

1535
01:32:52,306 --> 01:32:54,008
I wanna kill him.

1536
01:32:56,343 --> 01:32:58,312
I wanna tear him apart.

1537
01:33:01,916 --> 01:33:04,385
I can still hear
her voice in my head.

1538
01:33:09,256 --> 01:33:10,891
Even after she was hurt,

1539
01:33:11,025 --> 01:33:13,727
she said to me
that we did the right thing.

1540
01:33:22,436 --> 01:33:24,205
She told me
that with great power...

1541
01:33:26,307 --> 01:33:28,142
Comes great responsibility.

1542
01:33:33,380 --> 01:33:34,882
Wait, what?
How do you know that?

1543
01:33:35,015 --> 01:33:36,518
Uncle Ben said it.

1544
01:33:36,650 --> 01:33:38,185
The day he died.

1545
01:33:42,823 --> 01:33:45,192
Maybe she didn't die
for nothing, Peter.

1546
01:33:54,935 --> 01:34:00,609
Okay, so, uh, Connors,
Marko, Dillon and, um...

1547
01:34:00,741 --> 01:34:03,545
I think that I can repair the
devices for Dillon and Marko,

1548
01:34:03,677 --> 01:34:05,412
but the others...

1549
01:34:05,547 --> 01:34:08,782
Oh, I got Connors. I've cured
him once, so no big deal.

1550
01:34:10,417 --> 01:34:13,053
- What? It's no big deal.
- Great.

1551
01:34:13,187 --> 01:34:14,788
Yeah, that's great.

1552
01:34:17,057 --> 01:34:20,895
I think I can make
an anti-serum for Dr. Osborn.

1553
01:34:21,028 --> 01:34:22,930
Been thinking about it
a long time.

1554
01:34:25,933 --> 01:34:29,003
Gotta cure all of them. Right?

1555
01:34:30,037 --> 01:34:31,172
Right.

1556
01:34:32,607 --> 01:34:34,275
That's what we do.

1557
01:34:42,316 --> 01:34:43,751
What?

1558
01:34:43,884 --> 01:34:45,319
Just three yous.

1559
01:35:00,901 --> 01:35:01,936
Um...

1560
01:35:03,470 --> 01:35:07,074
So do you have
a best friend too?

1561
01:35:08,943 --> 01:35:10,244
I did.

1562
01:35:11,946 --> 01:35:13,347
You did?

1563
01:35:14,782 --> 01:35:16,585
He died in my arms...

1564
01:35:18,152 --> 01:35:20,154
after he tried to kill me.

1565
01:35:21,789 --> 01:35:23,757
It was heartbreaking.

1566
01:35:25,459 --> 01:35:26,827
Dude.

1567
01:35:33,501 --> 01:35:35,936
- Hey.
- Will you run a diagnostic?

1568
01:35:36,070 --> 01:35:37,271
Yeah.

1569
01:35:46,514 --> 01:35:48,650
Hey, you okay?

1570
01:35:48,782 --> 01:35:50,719
Uh, yeah, I'm fine.
Are you okay?

1571
01:35:50,851 --> 01:35:52,152
Mm-hm.

1572
01:35:54,788 --> 01:35:57,491
You don't deserve this.

1573
01:35:57,626 --> 01:36:01,529
- I've ruined your life.
- No. No, no, no.

1574
01:36:01,663 --> 01:36:03,732
Look at me. I'm here.

1575
01:36:05,132 --> 01:36:06,601
Not going anywhere.

1576
01:36:07,901 --> 01:36:09,236
We're gonna get through this.

1577
01:36:09,370 --> 01:36:12,006
And we're gonna get
through it together.

1578
01:36:12,139 --> 01:36:13,407
Okay?

1579
01:36:14,509 --> 01:36:17,211
Okay.

1580
01:36:21,549 --> 01:36:22,883
Thank you.

1581
01:36:34,028 --> 01:36:36,063
You have someone?

1582
01:36:36,196 --> 01:36:37,766
No.

1583
01:36:37,898 --> 01:36:42,803
Ah, I got no time for
Peter Parker stuff, you know?

1584
01:36:42,936 --> 01:36:44,405
Hm.

1585
01:36:44,539 --> 01:36:47,041
- Do you?
- Uh...

1586
01:36:47,174 --> 01:36:51,278
- that's a little complicated.
- Oh, I understand.

1587
01:36:51,412 --> 01:36:53,881
I guess it's just not
in the cards for guys like us.

1588
01:36:54,014 --> 01:36:56,551
Well, I wouldn't give up.

1589
01:36:56,685 --> 01:36:59,554
Took a while
but we made it work.

1590
01:36:59,688 --> 01:37:01,255
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1591
01:37:01,388 --> 01:37:02,856
Me and...

1592
01:37:02,990 --> 01:37:04,191
MJ.

1593
01:37:05,560 --> 01:37:07,461
My MJ. Uh...

1594
01:37:08,596 --> 01:37:11,031
It gets confusing here.

1595
01:37:11,165 --> 01:37:12,299
Yeah.

1596
01:37:12,433 --> 01:37:14,401
- Peter!
- Yeah?

1597
01:37:14,536 --> 01:37:17,871
- Oh, sorry, did you mean...?
- "Peter" Peter.

1598
01:37:18,005 --> 01:37:19,774
- We're all called Peter.
- We're all Peter.

1599
01:37:19,907 --> 01:37:22,910
- Peter Parker?
- Again, we're all Peter Parker.

1600
01:37:23,043 --> 01:37:25,647
- The computer.
- Oh!

1601
01:37:25,780 --> 01:37:27,381
- Oh, I'm ready.
- Yeah. Me too.

1602
01:37:27,515 --> 01:37:29,818
Okay, so now, all we gotta do

1603
01:37:29,950 --> 01:37:32,453
is lure these guys
someplace, right?

1604
01:37:32,587 --> 01:37:36,056
Try to cure them
while they try to kill us,

1605
01:37:36,190 --> 01:37:37,659
and then send them home.

1606
01:37:37,792 --> 01:37:40,394
- Using a magic box.
- Well, that's the plan.

1607
01:37:40,528 --> 01:37:43,631
Are you gonna go into battle
dressed as a cool youth pastor,

1608
01:37:43,765 --> 01:37:45,432
or do you got your suit?

1609
01:37:46,634 --> 01:37:48,770
- Good.
- Here's your web cartridges.

1610
01:37:48,902 --> 01:37:51,338
- Oh, thanks, man.
- What's that for?

1611
01:37:51,472 --> 01:37:54,776
Uh, it's my web fluid.
It's for my web shooters. Why?

1612
01:37:54,908 --> 01:37:56,377
Whoa!

1613
01:37:57,612 --> 01:37:58,613
That came out of you.

1614
01:37:58,747 --> 01:38:00,648
Yeah. You can't do that, huh?

1615
01:38:00,782 --> 01:38:02,983
- No.
- How on earth does that...?

1616
01:38:03,117 --> 01:38:05,820
We're getting sidetracked. This
is where we'll do this, okay?

1617
01:38:05,953 --> 01:38:08,355
It's isolated,
so no one should get hurt.

1618
01:38:08,489 --> 01:38:10,859
We draw them there with the box.
It's the thing they want.

1619
01:38:10,991 --> 01:38:13,060
All we have to do
is figure out how to get there.

1620
01:38:13,193 --> 01:38:14,562
- We could portal there.
- What?

1621
01:38:14,696 --> 01:38:17,064
- I'm magic now.
- Yeah, he's right. He can.

1622
01:38:17,197 --> 01:38:19,233
- Yeah, we saw.
- Yeah, he is.

1623
01:38:19,366 --> 01:38:21,201
- Wait, really?
- I got Doctor Strange magic.

1624
01:38:21,335 --> 01:38:23,170
- No way.
- Yeah.

1625
01:38:23,303 --> 01:38:25,573
I promise,
I won't turn into a supervillain

1626
01:38:25,707 --> 01:38:27,241
and try to kill you.

1627
01:38:29,009 --> 01:38:30,911
Okay.

1628
01:38:31,044 --> 01:38:32,680
Thank you.

1629
01:38:37,151 --> 01:38:39,420
Um, all right,
here goes nothing.

1630
01:38:39,554 --> 01:38:41,556
What's that thing
you always say?

1631
01:38:41,689 --> 01:38:45,259
- Expect disappointment and...
- No, no, no.

1632
01:38:45,392 --> 01:38:47,060
We're gonna kick some ass.

1633
01:38:47,194 --> 01:38:48,730
Okay.

1634
01:38:48,863 --> 01:38:51,365
Cure. Cure some ass.

1635
01:38:51,498 --> 01:38:53,267
Cure that ass.

1636
01:38:55,503 --> 01:38:57,137

01:39:11,619 --> 01:39:14,087

1654
01:39:39,213 --> 01:39:41,114
And where is "here," exactly?

1655
01:39:43,016 --> 01:39:45,118
A place that represents
second chances.

1656

<i>The Statue of Liberty?
Good God, folks.</i>

...wish me luck.

1661
01:40:01,603 --> 01:40:03,838
Your friendly neighborhood
Spider-Man could use some.

1662
01:40:10,310 --> 01:40:12,412
Okay, guys,
it could be any minute now.

1663
01:40:12,547 --> 01:40:14,816
Yep, almost done.

1664
01:40:19,654 --> 01:40:24,191
You know, Max was like
the sweetest guy ever

1665
01:40:24,324 --> 01:40:28,796
before he fell into...
a pool of electric eels.

1666
01:40:28,930 --> 01:40:30,598
That'll do it.

1667
01:40:31,933 --> 01:40:34,002
Mm. Oh, there it goes.

1668
01:40:35,269 --> 01:40:37,137
Heh, you okay?

1669
01:40:37,271 --> 01:40:39,039
Oh, it's my back.

1670
01:40:39,172 --> 01:40:42,442
It's kind of stiff
from all the swinging, I guess.

1671
01:40:42,577 --> 01:40:44,444
Yeah. No, I got
a middle back thing too.

1672
01:40:44,579 --> 01:40:47,949
- Really?
- Yeah. You want me to crack it?

1673
01:40:48,081 --> 01:40:49,383
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1674
01:40:49,517 --> 01:40:51,184
- Yeah, that'd be great.
- All right.

1675
01:40:52,587 --> 01:40:53,788
- You ready?
- Yeah.

1676
01:40:57,025 --> 01:40:59,226
Yep. That's good.

1677
01:40:59,359 --> 01:41:02,530
- How is it?
- Wow.

1678
01:41:02,664 --> 01:41:05,033
- That's good. That's better.
- Right? Yeah.

1679
01:41:05,165 --> 01:41:06,199
Wow.

1680
01:41:09,469 --> 01:41:12,372
This is so cool.
I always wanted brothers.

1681
01:41:13,942 --> 01:41:16,945
So you, like, make your own
web fluid in your body?

1682
01:41:17,077 --> 01:41:18,713
I'd rather not talk about this.

1683
01:41:18,846 --> 01:41:20,782
- I don't mean to...
- But are you teasing me?

1684
01:41:20,915 --> 01:41:22,282
No, no.
He's not teasing you.

1685
01:41:22,416 --> 01:41:24,686
It's just that we can't do that,

1686
01:41:24,819 --> 01:41:28,221
so we're curious as to how your
web situation works, that's all.

1687
01:41:28,355 --> 01:41:31,025
If it's personal, I don't wanna
pry, but I think it's cool.

1688
01:41:31,158 --> 01:41:34,194
I... I wish I could tell you,
but it's, like, I don't do it.

1689
01:41:34,328 --> 01:41:36,664
Like I don't...
Like I don't <i>do</i> breathing.

1690
01:41:36,798 --> 01:41:38,666
- Like, breathing just happens.
- Whoa.

1691
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:40,535
Does it just come out
of your wrists,

1692
01:41:40,668 --> 01:41:43,071
or does it come out
of anywhere else?

1693
01:41:43,203 --> 01:41:45,372
Only... Only the wrists.

1694
01:41:45,506 --> 01:41:47,675
Never had a block?
I run out of webs all the time.

1695
01:41:47,809 --> 01:41:50,243
- I have to make my own in a lab.
- Right. That's...

1696
01:41:50,377 --> 01:41:52,513
It's a hassle compared
to what you got.

1697
01:41:52,647 --> 01:41:54,048
Sounds like a hassle.
But I did.

1698
01:41:54,181 --> 01:41:55,415
You said that, I was like,

1699
01:41:55,550 --> 01:41:58,151
- "Oh, I had a web block."
- Whoa. Why?

1700
01:41:58,285 --> 01:41:59,921
Existential crisis stuff.

1701
01:42:00,054 --> 01:42:01,488
Yeah.
Don't get me started on that.

1702
01:42:01,623 --> 01:42:04,692
Hey. What are, like,
some of the craziest villains

1703
01:42:04,826 --> 01:42:07,095
- that you guys have fought?
- Seems you've met some of them.

1704
01:42:07,227 --> 01:42:08,796
Heh-heh, that's a good question.

1705
01:42:08,930 --> 01:42:14,234
Yeah, I fought an alien
made out of black goo once.

1706
01:42:14,368 --> 01:42:16,436
Oh, no way.
I fought an alien too.

1707
01:42:16,571 --> 01:42:18,238
- On Earth and in space.
- Oh.

1708
01:42:18,372 --> 01:42:20,108
- He was purple.
- I wanna fight an alien.

1709
01:42:20,240 --> 01:42:24,779
I'm still, like, that you fought
an alien in space.

1710
01:42:24,912 --> 01:42:27,582
I'm lame compared...
I fought a Russian guy

1711
01:42:27,715 --> 01:42:29,083
in a rhinoceros machine.

1712
01:42:29,216 --> 01:42:31,886
Can we rewind it back
to the "I'm lame" part?

1713
01:42:32,020 --> 01:42:34,321
- 'Cause you are not.
- Thanks. I appreciate that.

1714
01:42:34,454 --> 01:42:36,658
- I'm not saying I am...
- But it's just the self-talk.

1715
01:42:36,791 --> 01:42:38,626
- Maybe we should...
- Listen, I...

1716
01:42:38,760 --> 01:42:40,227
'Cause you're amazing.

1717
01:42:40,360 --> 01:42:42,229
Just to take it in for a minute.

1718
01:42:42,362 --> 01:42:44,799
- Yeah, I can take it in.
- You... You are amazing.

1719
01:42:44,932 --> 01:42:46,601
- I can. Thank you.
- You are amazing.

1720
01:42:46,734 --> 01:42:48,435
- Will you say it?
- I needed to hear that.

1721
01:42:48,569 --> 01:42:50,104
Thank you.

1722
01:42:50,237 --> 01:42:52,607
All right, guys, focus up.
You feel that?

1723
01:42:52,740 --> 01:42:54,008
Yeah.

1724
01:43:01,149 --> 01:43:03,084
What's up, Peter?

1725
01:43:05,385 --> 01:43:07,789
How you like the new-new?

1726
01:43:07,922 --> 01:43:11,759
Look, you give it to me,
I'm gonna destroy it.

1727
01:43:13,260 --> 01:43:15,096
But I'll let you live.

1728
01:43:15,228 --> 01:43:17,598
Don't make me a murderer, Peter.

1729
01:43:19,634 --> 01:43:21,669
Okay, guys, here he comes.

1730
01:43:28,109 --> 01:43:30,945
Hey, Max, I missed you, man. Ho!

1731
01:43:33,548 --> 01:43:35,983
All right, MJ, heads up!

1732
01:43:36,117 --> 01:43:38,251
Got it! Close it.

1733
01:43:40,387 --> 01:43:42,156
Uh, Ned, it's not closing.

1734
01:43:42,289 --> 01:43:43,423
Yeah, I know.

1735
01:43:43,558 --> 01:43:45,159
- Why isn't it closing?
- I don't know.

1736
01:43:45,292 --> 01:43:48,328
- Did you close it before? No?
- I mean, I've opened some.

1737
01:43:57,171 --> 01:43:59,540
Max, Max, Max.
Can we talk for a second?

1738
01:43:59,674 --> 01:44:02,342
- Just you and me, just talk?
- Look who showed up.

1739
01:44:02,476 --> 01:44:04,612
- My old friend Spider-Man.
- I'm trying to save you.

1740
01:44:04,746 --> 01:44:06,914
- That's all I've ever wanted.
- You're not trying to save me.

1741
01:44:07,048 --> 01:44:09,316
- I am.
- You ain't even the shit no more.

1742
01:44:09,449 --> 01:44:11,152
- Oh...
- Don't worry about me.

1743
01:44:11,284 --> 01:44:13,320
I'll save myself.

1744
01:44:13,453 --> 01:44:16,057
- Burn up!
- Aah! Whoa!

1745
01:44:16,190 --> 01:44:17,825
Well, I got his attention.
Now what?

1746
01:44:17,959 --> 01:44:19,392
Okay, great.

1747
01:44:19,527 --> 01:44:23,497
Just FYI, lizard guy's here too.

1748
01:44:24,966 --> 01:44:27,201
Guys, comm check. Hello?

1749
01:44:27,334 --> 01:44:28,770
<i>I need Max's cure.</i>

1750
01:44:28,903 --> 01:44:31,005
Yeah. I'm on it.

1751
01:44:31,139 --> 01:44:32,507
<i>I need the Lizard cure.</i>

1752
01:44:32,640 --> 01:44:34,842
Uh, okay, okay.

1753
01:44:39,847 --> 01:44:41,516
Where's the box, Peter?

1754
01:44:41,649 --> 01:44:43,885
- Flint, we could help everyone.
- I don't care!

1755
01:44:55,763 --> 01:44:56,964
Sorry!

1756
01:44:58,199 --> 01:44:59,267
Gross!

1757
01:44:59,399 --> 01:45:00,768
Sad to tell you, Sandman,

1758
01:45:00,902 --> 01:45:02,603
nobody's going home.

1759
01:45:41,008 --> 01:45:42,777
What the hell
is going on out there?

1760
01:45:42,910 --> 01:45:44,612
I keep yelling at you, Peter 2!

1761
01:45:44,745 --> 01:45:47,882
- But I thought you were Peter 2.
- What? I'm not Peter 2.

1762
01:45:48,015 --> 01:45:50,218
Stop arguing, both of you!
Listen to Peter 1.

1763
01:45:50,350 --> 01:45:52,153
We're clearly
not very good at this.

1764
01:45:52,286 --> 01:45:53,386
I know, I know. We suck.

1765
01:45:53,521 --> 01:45:55,223
I don't know
how to work as a team.

1766
01:45:55,355 --> 01:45:58,159
- Me neither.
- I do. I've been in a team, okay?

1767
01:45:58,292 --> 01:45:59,827
I don't wanna brag, but I will.

1768
01:45:59,961 --> 01:46:00,895
I was in the Avengers.

1769
01:46:01,028 --> 01:46:02,296
- The Avengers?
- Yeah.

1770
01:46:02,429 --> 01:46:03,631
- That's great.
- Thank you.

1771
01:46:03,764 --> 01:46:05,633
What is that?

1772
01:46:05,766 --> 01:46:07,735
- You don't have the Avengers?
- Is that a band?

1773
01:46:07,869 --> 01:46:10,304
- Are you in a band?
- No, I'm not in a band.

1774
01:46:10,437 --> 01:46:11,973
The Avengers is
Earth's mightiest...

1775
01:46:12,106 --> 01:46:13,808
- How's this helping?
- It's not important.

1776
01:46:13,941 --> 01:46:15,710
All we gotta do is focus,
trust your tingle

1777
01:46:15,843 --> 01:46:17,211
and coordinate our attacks.

1778
01:46:17,345 --> 01:46:18,779
Yes. Okay.

1779
01:46:18,913 --> 01:46:20,781
- Let's pick one target.
- Right.

1780
01:46:20,915 --> 01:46:22,449
We take them off the board
one at a time.

1781
01:46:22,583 --> 01:46:25,119
- You got it. Peter 1, Peter 2.
- Peter 2.

1782
01:46:25,253 --> 01:46:26,486
- Peter 3.
- Peter 3.

1783
01:46:26,621 --> 01:46:29,223
- Let's do this. Ready?
- Wait, wait, wait!

1784
01:46:29,357 --> 01:46:31,025
I love you guys.

1785
01:46:33,426 --> 01:46:34,795
Thank you.

1786
01:46:36,163 --> 01:46:38,332
- All right, let's do this.
- Let's go.

1787
01:46:44,138 --> 01:46:45,873
Yes!

1788
01:47:07,628 --> 01:47:09,563
Okay, Spider-Mans.

1789
01:47:09,697 --> 01:47:11,666
Sandman's first.

1790
01:47:11,799 --> 01:47:13,868
I'm gonna lead him
inside the statue.

1791
01:47:14,001 --> 01:47:16,504
I'll meet you at the top.

1792
01:47:18,139 --> 01:47:19,907
- Come on!
- Hey!

1793
01:47:22,944 --> 01:47:25,913
- Hey, Dr. Connors.
- Hello, Peter.

1794
01:47:27,114 --> 01:47:29,350
- Peter 1!
- I got it!

1795
01:47:40,962 --> 01:47:43,496
Flint, we're trying to help you!

1796
01:47:45,498 --> 01:47:47,101
Guys, I'm at the top.

1797
01:47:47,234 --> 01:47:48,569
I need the cure!

1798
01:47:50,972 --> 01:47:52,907
I'm coming, I'm coming,
I'm coming.

1799
01:47:54,474 --> 01:47:58,245
Just wait your turn, doc!

1800
01:47:58,379 --> 01:48:00,247
I'll be right back.

1801
01:48:36,751 --> 01:48:38,019
It's okay, Flint.

1802
01:48:40,221 --> 01:48:42,490
We're gonna get you home.

1803
01:48:42,623 --> 01:48:45,026
You just stay right here.

1804
01:48:49,663 --> 01:48:50,698
How do we stop him?

1805
01:48:50,831 --> 01:48:51,932
I've never seen him
this powerful.

1806
01:48:52,066 --> 01:48:52,933
It's the arc reactor.

1807
01:48:53,067 --> 01:48:54,135
We gotta get it off him.

1808
01:48:54,268 --> 01:48:56,203
You're not gonna
take this from me.

1809
01:48:58,773 --> 01:49:00,441
That's not gonna work.

1810
01:49:04,945 --> 01:49:06,515
We gotta do this up close.

1811
01:49:06,647 --> 01:49:08,382
Peter 2, go right.
Peter 3, go left.

1812
01:49:08,517 --> 01:49:09,550
On me. Unh!

1813
01:49:13,254 --> 01:49:15,723
Yeah!

1814
01:49:37,078 --> 01:49:40,181
I'm trying to close it.
I can't help that it's not working.

1815
01:49:40,314 --> 01:49:43,117
It's fine. You'll do it again.
We'll keep trying.

1816
01:49:43,250 --> 01:49:45,019
- All right, we got this.
- Focus and close the portal.

1817
01:49:45,152 --> 01:49:46,387
Close it.

1818
01:49:49,657 --> 01:49:51,358
Oh, no. No, no, no.

1819
01:49:51,492 --> 01:49:54,061
And that is a lizard,
and we should go!

1820
01:49:58,666 --> 01:50:00,367
Run!

1821
01:50:00,502 --> 01:50:02,903
Come on! Come on, this way.
Quick, quick, quick!

1822
01:50:03,037 --> 01:50:04,305
Connors, stop!

1823
01:50:13,681 --> 01:50:14,882
Yeah.

1824
01:50:27,261 --> 01:50:29,730
Leave them. They're mine.

1825
01:50:29,864 --> 01:50:32,399
I don't need your help.
I got it just fine.

1826
01:50:32,534 --> 01:50:34,768
Dr. Octavius, no.

1827
01:50:37,271 --> 01:50:39,073
What are you doing?

1828
01:50:40,374 --> 01:50:41,642
Get it off of me.

1829
01:50:52,554 --> 01:50:53,754
There you go.

1830
01:51:12,740 --> 01:51:13,807
MJ!

1831
01:51:24,619 --> 01:51:26,053
Whoa.

1832
01:51:26,187 --> 01:51:27,988
- We gotta hide this thing.
- Oh, right.

1833
01:51:32,193 --> 01:51:34,128
- Nice, Ned!
- Oh, yeah!

1834
01:51:35,062 --> 01:51:37,231
Oh.

1835
01:51:37,364 --> 01:51:38,332
Where is he?

1836
01:51:38,465 --> 01:51:39,967
- No!
- Wait, wait, wait.

1837
01:51:40,100 --> 01:51:41,402
Before you do anything, Mister...

1838
01:51:41,536 --> 01:51:44,104
Doctor Strange, sir,
Peter's plan is working.

1839
01:51:44,238 --> 01:51:46,407
- What plan?
- He's curing them.

1840
01:51:54,982 --> 01:51:56,183
Dr. Connors?

1841
01:51:59,554 --> 01:52:01,121
Welcome back, sir.

1842
01:52:02,756 --> 01:52:04,458
Well, I'll be damned.

1843
01:52:06,961 --> 01:52:09,463
Did you just open a portal?

1844
01:52:09,598 --> 01:52:11,365
Yes... Yes, sir, I did.

1845
01:52:11,498 --> 01:52:12,866
Hmm.

1846
01:52:18,506 --> 01:52:22,276
Max?

1847
01:52:22,409 --> 01:52:25,547
- Don't worry. I'm all tapped out.
- Are you sure about that?

1848
01:52:27,448 --> 01:52:29,183
Back to being a nobody.

1849
01:52:29,316 --> 01:52:32,554
- You were never a nobody, Max.
- Yes, I was. Yes, I was.

1850
01:52:32,687 --> 01:52:33,754
You didn't see me.

1851
01:52:35,322 --> 01:52:37,157
Can I tell you something,
though?

1852
01:52:37,291 --> 01:52:38,892
Yeah.

1853
01:52:39,026 --> 01:52:41,529
You got a nice face.
You're just a kid.

1854
01:52:41,663 --> 01:52:44,431
- Ehh...
- You're from Queens.

1855
01:52:44,566 --> 01:52:47,835
You got that suit.
You help a lot of poor people.

1856
01:52:47,968 --> 01:52:50,871
I just thought
you was gonna be Black.

1857
01:52:51,005 --> 01:52:53,340
- Oh, man, I'm sorry.
- Oh, don't apologize.

1858
01:52:53,474 --> 01:52:56,844
There's gotta be a Black
Spider-Man somewhere out there.

1859
01:52:59,346 --> 01:53:01,081
Goddamn eels.

1860
01:53:04,318 --> 01:53:06,186
The power of the sun.

1861
01:53:08,989 --> 01:53:11,091
In the palm of your hand.

1862
01:53:11,225 --> 01:53:12,694
Peter?

1863
01:53:14,328 --> 01:53:15,730
Otto.

1864
01:53:17,097 --> 01:53:19,701
Oh, it's good to see you,
dear boy.

1865
01:53:19,833 --> 01:53:21,802
It's good to see you.

1866
01:53:21,935 --> 01:53:23,470
You're all grown up.

1867
01:53:24,905 --> 01:53:26,040
How are you?

1868
01:53:28,242 --> 01:53:29,376
Trying to do better.

1869
01:53:36,718 --> 01:53:38,553
- Strange, wait, we're so close.
- Skip it!

1870
01:53:38,687 --> 01:53:41,422
I've been dangling over
the Grand Canyon for 12 hours.

1871
01:53:41,556 --> 01:53:44,592
I know, I know, I know.
I, uh... Um... Uh...

1872
01:53:44,726 --> 01:53:47,261
I'm sorry about that, sir.
I mean...

1873
01:53:47,394 --> 01:53:50,364
- You went to the Grand Canyon?
- He could have used your help.

1874
01:53:50,497 --> 01:53:52,600
It's okay.
Uh, these are my new friends.

1875
01:53:52,734 --> 01:53:55,035
This is Peter Parker, Peter
Parker. Spider-Man, Spider-Man.

1876
01:53:55,169 --> 01:53:56,571
They're mes
from other universes.

1877
01:53:56,705 --> 01:53:57,905
- No, no, no.
- They're here to help.

1878
01:53:58,038 --> 01:53:59,039
He's the wizard
I told you about.

1879
01:53:59,173 --> 01:54:00,874
Look, I am really impressed

1880
01:54:01,008 --> 01:54:04,144
that you've managed to give them
all a second chance, kid.

1881
01:54:04,278 --> 01:54:06,413
But this has to end. Now.

1882
01:54:06,548 --> 01:54:09,983
Can the Spider-Man
come out to play?

1883
01:54:31,840 --> 01:54:33,508
Strange, no!

1884
01:55:02,336 --> 01:55:03,638
Are you okay?

1885
01:55:04,639 --> 01:55:06,039
Yeah.

1886
01:55:06,173 --> 01:55:07,474
I'm okay.

1887
01:55:09,778 --> 01:55:10,978
Are you okay?

1888
01:55:28,162 --> 01:55:29,196
Whoa!

1889
01:56:28,422 --> 01:56:30,424
Thank you, Mr. Cape, sir.

1890
01:56:33,327 --> 01:56:34,529
Ned?

1891
01:56:35,530 --> 01:56:36,931
- Ned!
- Hey!

1892
01:56:41,201 --> 01:56:43,270
- MJ!
- Peter?

1893
01:56:43,403 --> 01:56:45,974
- Ned!
- Peter!

1894
01:56:46,106 --> 01:56:47,241
Hey!

1895
01:56:47,374 --> 01:56:49,476
- Are you okay?
- We're okay!

1896
01:57:03,591 --> 01:57:05,459
Poor Peter.

1897
01:57:05,593 --> 01:57:09,697
Too weak to send me home to die.

1898
01:57:09,831 --> 01:57:11,331
No.

1899
01:57:11,465 --> 01:57:13,968
I just wanna kill you myself.

1900
01:57:14,101 --> 01:57:15,837
Attaboy.

1901
01:59:05,278 --> 01:59:09,584
She was there because of you.

1902
01:59:09,717 --> 01:59:13,788
I may have struck the blow,
but you...

1903
01:59:16,557 --> 01:59:20,995
Ha-ha, you are the one
that killed her.

1904
01:59:48,022 --> 01:59:49,624
Peter.

1905
02:00:02,369 --> 02:00:03,638
What have I done?

1906
02:00:07,642 --> 02:00:09,342
- It's you.
- You okay?

1907
02:00:09,476 --> 02:00:12,613
Uh, yeah, I'm good.
I've been stabbed before.

1908
02:00:12,747 --> 02:00:14,314
- Oh, good, good, good.
- Hey.

1909
02:00:14,448 --> 02:00:16,918
- Oh, man.
- Hey, nice catch.

1910
02:00:17,985 --> 02:00:21,354
Nice throw.

1911
02:00:21,488 --> 02:00:24,324
What? Is that happening,
or am I dying?

1912
02:00:24,458 --> 02:00:25,827
Yeah, that's happening.
That's real.

1913
02:00:25,960 --> 02:00:27,795
Are there people in the sky?

1914
02:00:36,436 --> 02:00:38,773
- I gotta go.
- Yeah. I got it. You okay?

1915
02:00:43,177 --> 02:00:44,411
What's happening?

1916
02:00:44,545 --> 02:00:46,714
They're coming through.
I can't stop them.

1917
02:00:46,848 --> 02:00:48,248
There's gotta be
something we could do.

1918
02:00:48,381 --> 02:00:49,851
Can't you just
cast the spell again?

1919
02:00:49,984 --> 02:00:52,220
The original way,
before I screwed it up.

1920
02:00:52,352 --> 02:00:54,488
We're too late for that.
They're here.

1921
02:00:54,622 --> 02:00:56,724
They're here because of you.

1922
02:01:02,029 --> 02:01:03,598
What if everyone
forgot who I was?

1923
02:01:03,731 --> 02:01:04,832
What?

1924
02:01:04,966 --> 02:01:06,366
They're coming
because of me, right?

1925
02:01:06,501 --> 02:01:09,737
Because I'm Peter Parker?
So cast a new spell.

1926
02:01:09,871 --> 02:01:12,240
But this time, make everyone
forget who Peter Parker is.

1927
02:01:12,372 --> 02:01:14,108
Make everyone forget...

1928
02:01:15,710 --> 02:01:17,078
- me.
- No.

1929
02:01:17,211 --> 02:01:21,281
- But it would work, right?
- Yeah, it would work.

1930
02:01:21,414 --> 02:01:24,018
But you gotta understand,
that would mean that everyone

1931
02:01:24,152 --> 02:01:27,054
who knows and loves you, we...

1932
02:01:28,823 --> 02:01:30,958
We'd have no memory of you.

1933
02:01:32,492 --> 02:01:34,796
It would be as though
you never existed.

1934
02:01:37,832 --> 02:01:39,233
I know.

1935
02:01:40,535 --> 02:01:41,903
Do it.

1936
02:01:45,506 --> 02:01:48,609
You better go and say your
goodbyes. You don't have long.

1937
02:01:48,743 --> 02:01:50,912
- Thank you, sir.
- Call me Stephen.

1938
02:01:54,248 --> 02:01:55,348
Thank you, Stephen.

1939
02:01:57,417 --> 02:02:00,288
Yeah. Still feels weird.

1940
02:02:02,890 --> 02:02:04,125
I'll see you around.

1941
02:02:06,027 --> 02:02:07,562
So long, kid.

1942
02:02:14,836 --> 02:02:17,705
Hey. Uh, I think this is it.

1943
02:02:17,839 --> 02:02:20,074
- I think you're about to go home.
- Okay.

1944
02:02:20,208 --> 02:02:23,144
- All right.
- Um, look, I, uh...

1945
02:02:24,612 --> 02:02:26,446
Thank you.

1946
02:02:26,581 --> 02:02:30,284
I just wanna... I want you to...
I wanna tell you that...

1947
02:02:30,417 --> 02:02:32,320
I don't know how to say this.

1948
02:02:32,452 --> 02:02:34,222
- Peter.
- I want you to know that I...

1949
02:02:35,857 --> 02:02:38,425
You know. It's what we do.

1950
02:02:40,228 --> 02:02:42,930
Yeah, it's what we do. Um...

1951
02:02:43,064 --> 02:02:46,834
Right, I gotta find Ned and MJ.
I, uh...

1952
02:02:46,968 --> 02:02:49,170
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1953
02:02:53,473 --> 02:02:55,943
- I guess I'll see you.
- See you.

1954
02:02:56,077 --> 02:02:57,712
Bye.

1955
02:02:59,647 --> 02:03:01,481
- Oh...
- You're in so much pain, huh?

1956
02:03:01,616 --> 02:03:02,683
- I am.
- Yeah.

1957
02:03:06,687 --> 02:03:08,723
Oh, you're okay. Oh!

1958
02:03:08,856 --> 02:03:11,726
Yeah, you did.
So proud of you.

1959
02:03:11,859 --> 02:03:14,729
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, we're okay.

1960
02:03:14,862 --> 02:03:16,898
- Oh, my God, you're bleeding.
- I'm fine. I'm okay.

1961
02:03:17,031 --> 02:03:18,866
- You sure?
- I'm fine, I promise.

1962
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:20,334
- Okay, okay.
- I promise.

1963
02:03:20,467 --> 02:03:22,402
Good.

1964
02:03:22,536 --> 02:03:25,072
Um, we should go, right?

1965
02:03:27,608 --> 02:03:30,410
Yeah. You're gonna forget
who I am.

1966
02:03:32,346 --> 02:03:33,714
- What?
- Forget who you are?

1967
02:03:33,848 --> 02:03:35,917
What are you talking about?

1968
02:03:36,050 --> 02:03:38,819
It's okay.
I'm gonna come and find you,

1969
02:03:38,953 --> 02:03:40,821
and I'll explain everything.

1970
02:03:42,657 --> 02:03:45,393
I'll make you remember me.

1971
02:03:45,526 --> 02:03:48,229
And it'll be like none of this
ever happened. Okay?

1972
02:03:48,362 --> 02:03:51,532
But what if that doesn't work?
What if that doesn't work?

1973
02:03:51,666 --> 02:03:54,669
What if we can't remember you?
I don't wanna do that.

1974
02:03:54,802 --> 02:03:57,638
- I don't wanna do that.
- I know. MJ, I know.

1975
02:03:57,772 --> 02:04:01,342
There's not something we can do?
We can't come up with a plan?

1976
02:04:01,474 --> 02:04:03,811
There's always
something we can do.

1977
02:04:04,946 --> 02:04:06,747
There's nothing we can do.

1978
02:04:10,785 --> 02:04:12,386
But it'll be okay.

1979
02:04:16,223 --> 02:04:17,258
You promise?

1980
02:04:20,361 --> 02:04:21,896
Yeah, I promise.

1981
02:04:33,074 --> 02:04:35,076
I'll come find you, okay?

1982
02:04:35,209 --> 02:04:36,877
I know you will.

1983
02:04:37,979 --> 02:04:39,513
- Okay.
- Okay.

1984
02:04:41,481 --> 02:04:42,850
You better.

1985
02:04:44,685 --> 02:04:46,620
If you don't,
I'll just figure it out.

1986
02:04:46,754 --> 02:04:49,223
I've done it before,
I can do it again.

1987
02:04:50,224 --> 02:04:52,093
I promise I'll fix this.

1988
02:04:53,194 --> 02:04:54,795
I really hate magic.

1989
02:04:56,097 --> 02:04:57,598
Yeah. Me too.

1990
02:05:01,936 --> 02:05:03,070
I love you.

1991
02:05:09,410 --> 02:05:11,846
- I love...
- Just wait.

1992
02:05:11,979 --> 02:05:14,482
Wait and tell me
when you see me again.

1993
02:05:16,417 --> 02:05:17,785
Sure.

1994
02:06:44,939 --> 02:06:46,474
<i>I love you.</i>

1995
02:07:24,745 --> 02:07:26,914
<i>It's been a few
weeks since the fiasco</i>

1996
02:07:27,047 --> 02:07:29,584
on the Statue of Liberty,
and Spider-Man's cultists

1997
02:07:29,717 --> 02:07:34,421
continue to contend that
the vile vigilante is a hero.

1998
02:07:34,556 --> 02:07:36,591
Well, if he were a hero,
he'd unmask himself

1999
02:07:36,724 --> 02:07:38,659
and tell us who he really is,

2000
02:07:38,792 --> 02:07:42,263
because only a coward
conceals his identity.

2001
02:07:42,396 --> 02:07:45,499
Only a coward hides
his true intentions.

2002
02:07:45,634 --> 02:07:47,835
<i>Rest assured,
ladies and gentlemen,</i>

2003
02:07:47,968 --> 02:07:50,237
<i>this reporter will uncover
those intentions</i>

2004
02:07:50,371 --> 02:07:52,006
<i>come hell or high water.</i>

2005
02:07:52,139 --> 02:07:57,111
Hi. My name is Peter Parker.
You don't know me, but I, uh...

2006
02:07:58,580 --> 02:07:59,914
Hi, my name is Peter Parker,

2007
02:08:00,047 --> 02:08:01,982
and you don't know me, but you...

2008
02:08:04,919 --> 02:08:06,787
Okay, come on.

2009
02:08:08,389 --> 02:08:09,957
- No way.
- Hard to believe, isn't it?

2010
02:08:19,800 --> 02:08:21,135
Hey.

2011
02:08:26,240 --> 02:08:28,643
One sec. Can I help you?

2012
02:08:28,776 --> 02:08:33,180
Hi. Um, my name
is Peter Parker, and I...

2013
02:08:36,817 --> 02:08:40,154
would like a coffee, please.

2014
02:08:40,287 --> 02:08:42,356
Okay, no problem, Peter Parker.

2015
02:08:49,631 --> 02:08:51,465
Doughnut for
my fellow Engineer.

2016
02:08:51,600 --> 02:08:53,467
Oh! Wait, what?

2017
02:08:53,602 --> 02:08:55,369
MIT, they're the Engineers.
The mascot.

2018
02:08:55,503 --> 02:08:58,005
Oh, right, right, right.
I should probably know that.

2019
02:08:58,138 --> 02:09:00,174
Look at you
with the school spirit.

2020
02:09:00,307 --> 02:09:02,042
Tell anybody, I will deny it.

2021
02:09:02,176 --> 02:09:03,877
Oh, okay.

2022
02:09:13,521 --> 02:09:16,357
Peter Parker? Peter Parker.

2023
02:09:16,490 --> 02:09:17,592
Your coffee.

2024
02:09:17,726 --> 02:09:19,226
- Right. Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

2025
02:09:19,360 --> 02:09:20,562
Um...

2026
02:09:22,129 --> 02:09:24,198
Are you excited for MIT?

2027
02:09:25,165 --> 02:09:27,234
Oh, uh, right. Yeah.

2028
02:09:27,368 --> 02:09:30,739
Uh, yeah. Actually,
I am excited, which is weird,

2029
02:09:30,871 --> 02:09:33,173
'cause I don't really
get excited about things.

2030
02:09:33,307 --> 02:09:34,908
I kind of expect disappointment.

2031
02:09:35,042 --> 02:09:38,112
'Cause then you'll never
actually be disappointed.

2032
02:09:38,245 --> 02:09:40,214
Right?

2033
02:09:40,347 --> 02:09:41,949
Uh...

2034
02:09:42,082 --> 02:09:43,917
yeah. Right.

2035
02:09:45,319 --> 02:09:47,354
I don't know, it kind of
feels different

2036
02:09:47,488 --> 02:09:49,290
this time for some reason.

2037
02:10:00,034 --> 02:10:01,435
Right. Um...

2038
02:10:02,671 --> 02:10:04,972
What I was...

2039
02:10:13,515 --> 02:10:15,617
You okay?

2040
02:10:15,750 --> 02:10:17,885
It doesn't really hurt anymore.

2041
02:10:28,362 --> 02:10:30,799
Is there anything else?

2042
02:10:43,077 --> 02:10:44,311
No.

2043
02:10:47,881 --> 02:10:49,751
Thank you.

2044
02:10:49,883 --> 02:10:51,285
No problem.

2045
02:10:57,391 --> 02:10:59,728
I'll, uh, see you around.

2046
02:12:03,858 --> 02:12:05,426
How'd you know her?

2047
02:12:08,897 --> 02:12:10,964
Through Spider-Man.

2048
02:12:11,098 --> 02:12:11,999
You?

2049
02:12:12,132 --> 02:12:13,501
Same.

2050
02:12:18,840 --> 02:12:21,308
I lost a good friend
a while back.

2051
02:12:21,442 --> 02:12:22,976
Felt like this.

2052
02:12:25,212 --> 02:12:27,882
It hurts 'cause they're gone
and then it hurts all over again

2053
02:12:28,015 --> 02:12:29,884
because you remember
what they stood for

2054
02:12:30,017 --> 02:12:33,187
and you wonder,
"Is all that gone too?"

2055
02:12:37,525 --> 02:12:39,193
No, it's not gone.

2056
02:12:41,796 --> 02:12:43,765
Everyone that she helped...

2057
02:12:45,867 --> 02:12:48,202
they'll keep it going.

2058
02:12:48,335 --> 02:12:49,871
You really think so?

2059
02:12:50,905 --> 02:12:51,940
I know it.

2060
02:12:54,074 --> 02:12:57,545

- Yeah. Nice to meet you.

he had a tin suit
and he could fly, right?

2142
02:17:45,166 --> 02:17:48,102
Okay, and there was
a really angry green man.

2143
02:17:48,236 --> 02:17:50,171
- Hulk.
- Hulk.

<i>And you thought Lethal
Protector was a shit name.</i>

Yeah, because it is.

2146
02:17:54,474 --> 02:17:55,710
Now tell me again

2147
02:17:55,843 --> 02:17:58,746
about your purple alien
that loves stones.

2148
02:17:58,880 --> 02:18:01,516
'Cause I'll tell you what, man,
aliens do not love stones.

2149
02:18:01,649 --> 02:18:03,584
- <i>Eddie, don't start.</i>
- They don't.

2150
02:18:03,718 --> 02:18:05,686
Know what aliens love?
Eating brains.

2151
02:18:05,820 --> 02:18:07,922
Because that's what they do.
All right?

2152
02:18:08,055 --> 02:18:10,725
Señor, he made
my family disappear.

2153
02:18:12,093 --> 02:18:13,194
For five years.

2154
02:18:14,529 --> 02:18:15,596
Five years?

2155
02:18:17,865 --> 02:18:19,033
That's a long time.

2156
02:18:21,434 --> 02:18:22,937
Maybe I...

2157
02:18:23,070 --> 02:18:25,873
Maybe I should go to New York
and speak to this...

2158
02:18:27,374 --> 02:18:28,341
Spider-Man.

2159
02:18:28,475 --> 02:18:31,546
<i>Eddie, we are drunk.</i>

2160
02:18:32,914 --> 02:18:34,182
<i>Let's go skinny-dip!</i>

2161
02:18:34,314 --> 02:18:35,750
I don't think
we should skinny-dip.

2162
02:18:35,883 --> 02:18:37,685
You have to pay the bill.

2163
02:18:37,819 --> 02:18:39,187
<i>What is happening? No!</i>

2164
02:18:39,319 --> 02:18:41,622
<i>No, we just got here!
No, not again!</i>

2165
02:18:46,260 --> 02:18:48,029
And there he goes.

2166
02:18:48,162 --> 02:18:51,098
Without paying the bill,
no tips, nothing.

2167
02:26:01,563 --> 02:26:03,531
<i>Don't cast that spell.</i>

2168
02:26:03,665 --> 02:26:05,667
- <i>It's too dangerous.</i>
- <i>Why?</i>

2169
02:26:05,799 --> 02:26:09,069
<i>We tampered with
the stability of space-time.</i>

2170
02:26:09,203 --> 02:26:11,071
<i>The multiverse is a concept</i>

Wanda.

2177
02:26:59,688 --> 02:27:02,222
Well, I knew sooner or later
you'd show up.

2178
02:27:02,356 --> 02:27:06,060
I made mistakes,
and people were hurt.

2179
02:27:06,193 --> 02:27:08,563
I'm not here to talk
about Westview.

2180
02:27:09,531 --> 02:27:10,765
Then what are you here for?

2181
02:27:10,898 --> 02:27:11,932
We need your help.

2182
02:27:13,367 --> 02:27:14,602
With what?

2183
02:27:14,736 --> 02:27:16,370
What do you know
about the multiverse?

2184
02:27:25,212 --> 02:27:26,413
I'm sorry, Stephen.

2185
02:27:28,882 --> 02:27:31,151
