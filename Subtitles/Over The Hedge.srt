1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,460
- TPX -

3
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,874
Oh, no!

4
00:00:37,074 --> 00:00:39,289
Come on!

5
00:00:55,848 --> 00:00:57,432
Come on, baby.

6
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:00,769
Grab it!

7
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,072
All right.

8
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:18,328
What...?

9
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:23,166
Ow!

10
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:33,802
Hmm. Vincent.

11
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:38,097
No, no, bad idea.
Bad idea!

12
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:22,059
Hmm?

13
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:30,818
Aah!

14
00:02:57,928 --> 00:03:00,309
Just take what you need.

15
00:03:00,509 --> 00:03:02,891
Just take
what you need.

16
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,731
Mm-hmm.

17
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:27,377
What's...?

18
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:34,882
Mmm.

19
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:51,648
Whuh?

20
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:57,282
- RJ?
- Uh, no?

21
00:03:57,482 --> 00:04:00,081
The moon's not full.

22
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:05,537
You woke me up a week early?

23
00:04:05,737 --> 00:04:07,422
Oh, no.

24
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:12,711
Don't tell me you're dumb enough to
actually try and steal my stuff.

25
00:04:12,911 --> 00:04:16,056
RJ, I'm gonna have
to kill you.

26
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,884
Please, I'm just a desperate
guy trying to feed his family.

27
00:04:19,084 --> 00:04:21,520
- You don't have a family.
- I meant a family of one.

28
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,473
OK, wait, wait, wait, wait!
Look, it's still in the cave.

29
00:04:25,673 --> 00:04:28,268
So, technically,
not stolen.

30
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:30,666
Oh, no!

31
00:04:30,866 --> 00:04:33,065
No!

32
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:39,038
Slow!

33
00:04:39,238 --> 00:04:42,123
Stop!

34
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:44,084
Whew!

35
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:47,788
That was close.

36
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:56,513
Vincent, wait!
I can get it all back!

37
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:59,841
That's right!
If you eat me, you'd have to do it.

38
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:02,719
But I can get it.
All of it!

39
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:05,397
- My red wagon?
- Redder! Ow.

40
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:08,558
- The blue cooler?
- Blue cooler. On my list!

41
00:05:08,758 --> 00:05:09,860
- Gotta be blue?
- Yes!

42
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,380
And I want my Spuddies.
I love those things.

43
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:16,600
'Cause with a Spuddie,
enough just isn't enough.

44
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,620
So true. Painfully true.
And I'll tell you what.

45
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,697
I'm gonna get you the giant picnic pack,
family-fun size.

46
00:05:22,897 --> 00:05:26,221
- They have that?
- I'm pretty sure.

47
00:05:26,421 --> 00:05:29,485
All right, RJ.
I'm going back to sleep.

48
00:05:29,685 --> 00:05:32,549
When that moon is full,
I'm waking up.

49
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:37,136
And all my stuff had better
be right back where it was.

50
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:40,841
But that's just one week!
That's impossible for one guy!

51
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,810
A week's perfect.
I'll get some helpers.

52
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:47,597
Full moon, all my stuff.
And don't even think about running away.

53
00:05:47,797 --> 00:05:52,477
Because if you do,
I will hunt you down and kill you.

54
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:59,326
OK! OK, buddy! You just rest easy,
all right, 'cause I'm on it.

55
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:04,323
Hey, in a week from now, we're gonna
be laughing about this thing. Huh?

56
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:41,785
<i>How great I am</i>

57
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:45,780
<i>Gotta tell myself
Yeah, I'm the man</i>

58
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,866
<i>Looks grim right now</i>

59
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:52,620
<i>But pretty soon
we'll be laughing about it</i>

60
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,382
<i>Ooh, and it's all right</i>

61
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:58,543
<i>Yeah, it is
I swear, you'll see</i>

62
00:06:58,743 --> 00:07:00,095
<i>It's not, really</i>

63
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:02,973
<i>Yeah, and it's all right</i>

64
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:09,012
<i>'Cause I've always
got my family of me</i>

65
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:15,276
<i>- It's not a first
- Might be the last</i>

66
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:18,521
<i>Yeah,
I'm sure I must've been through worse</i>

67
00:07:18,721 --> 00:07:21,700
<i>But, ooh, it's all right</i>

68
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:26,621
<i>Got a paddle and a creek</i>

69
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:29,390
<i>Yeah, and it's all right</i>

70
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:33,006
<i>Because I've always</i>

71
00:07:33,206 --> 00:07:35,857
<i>Got my family</i>

72
00:07:36,057 --> 00:07:38,508
<i>Of me</i>

73
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,277
Oh, boy,
that's cold! That's cold!

74
00:07:41,477 --> 00:07:44,047
The one place
I didn't have a shell.

75
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:57,102
Wow.

76
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:05,619
Spring.

77
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,280
That means there's only
274 days left till winter.

78
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,450
Everybody, wake up!
Hibernation's over.

79
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:12,542
Oh, morning!

80
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:15,329
- Morning, Hammy.
- I gotta go wee-wee!

81
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:17,505
Oh, not in the lake
we drink from!

82
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:20,417
Let's go, all right, the rest of you.
It's spring!

83
00:08:20,617 --> 00:08:22,502
That means
we gotta get to work.

84
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:25,555
Finished. No, wait!

85
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:28,716
Come on, everybody. Wake up.
Don't make me come in there.

86
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:29,977
Ya'll better listen.

87
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:32,220
I've been holding
something in all winter,

88
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:33,897
and I'm about to let it out.

89
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:37,351
- I'm up, I'm up!
- She means it. Let's go!

90
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:38,777
Thank you, Stella.

91
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:41,980
Oh, I can clear a room, Verne.
Come on, that much I can do.

92
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:44,158
- Good morning.
- Good morning, everyone!

93
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:47,610
- How'd you guys sleep?
- Just a super-duper morning.

94
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:48,996
Oh, jeepers.

95
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:51,952
Whoa, not lookin' so good
around the eyes there, hon.

96
00:08:52,152 --> 00:08:54,909
Bucky and Quillo were up
every three or four weeks.

97
00:08:55,109 --> 00:08:56,682
And Spike kept poking me.

98
00:08:56,882 --> 00:08:58,255
Yeah. Well, he's kinda pokey.

99
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:00,299
He's the sharpest
of the bunch there.

100
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:02,834
You know what? How 'bout
I take the day shift?

101
00:09:03,034 --> 00:09:04,719
Oh, Lou,
that'd be just super.

102
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:10,717
All right, kids, you heard your mother,
and now you listen to me. Shape up.

103
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:11,726
Oh, boy.

104
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,937
This is what I was afraid of.

105
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:17,316
Where's the food? Is there any left?
I'm hungry, so is there any left?

106
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:21,853
We ate all the food, Hammy. During the
winter? We gotta go get some more now.

107
00:09:22,053 --> 00:09:24,501
Oh, right! I buried
some nuts in the woods.

108
00:09:24,701 --> 00:09:27,150
I know where they are.
I'll be right back. Bye!

109
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:34,115
- That's enough.
- Dad, it was just snow.

110
00:09:34,315 --> 00:09:36,430
But it could have been
a predator.

111
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:38,901
Isn't playing dead
a little... weak?

112
00:09:39,101 --> 00:09:41,373
Heather, how many times
must I say it?

113
00:09:41,573 --> 00:09:44,042
Playing possum
is what we do.

114
00:09:44,242 --> 00:09:46,345
We die so that we live!

115
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:48,471
I'm the boss of you, OK?
So calm down.

116
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:52,217
That's what we need to find you this year,
don't you know? A good fella.

117
00:09:52,417 --> 00:09:56,012
- A good fella? A good fella?
- Uh-oh. Jeepers, here we go.

118
00:09:56,212 --> 00:09:58,264
Why does everyone think
I need a man, huh?

119
00:09:58,464 --> 00:10:00,495
I look like a nest
and smell like a swamp.

120
00:10:00,695 --> 00:10:02,527
So when you find
a fella who's decent,

121
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:06,356
good with kids and has no sense of smell,
call me.

122
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:17,200
- Um, hello?
- I don't care who started it.

123
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,377
Uh...

124
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:20,128
Oh, look, food.

125
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:23,831
Well, I think you know
what this means.

126
00:10:24,031 --> 00:10:25,926
- Verne.
- Just a minute, Hammy.

127
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:30,171
This means we were nine
berries away from starvation.

128
00:10:30,371 --> 00:10:32,673
Sorry.
That was a little intense.

129
00:10:32,873 --> 00:10:35,176
I meant really serious
hunger pains.

130
00:10:35,376 --> 00:10:36,603
Verne!

131
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:40,140
Not finished, Hammy.
Morning, Lou, Penny.

132
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,691
- Thanks.
- Hey, kids.

133
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,484
- What I want to tell you is...
- Verne!

134
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:46,754
I'm not done, Hammy.
If you have to go again, just go.

135
00:10:46,954 --> 00:10:49,824
OK. So all I'm saying
is we cut it a little close.

136
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:53,115
So this year we need to make
sure that we fill the log...

137
00:10:53,315 --> 00:10:56,406
- All the way to the top.
- Exactly. All the way to the top.

138
00:10:56,606 --> 00:10:59,054
- Because what are we?
- Foragers!

139
00:10:59,254 --> 00:11:01,502
- And what do we forage?
- Food!

140
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:04,372
- Right.
- Super, Verne, really super.

141
00:11:04,572 --> 00:11:06,174
- OK, Hammy.
- Huh?

142
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:07,796
- What is it?
- What is what?

143
00:11:07,996 --> 00:11:09,419
What is it you want
to tell me?

144
00:11:09,619 --> 00:11:10,804
Hmm? Oh. Oh!

145
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:13,548
What was it, what was it,
what was it, what was it?

146
00:11:13,748 --> 00:11:15,779
Wait. Right on the tip
of my tongue. Oh, yeah!

147
00:11:15,979 --> 00:11:18,011
There's a weird thing
I've never seen before.

148
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:20,430
It's really scary.
Follow me.

149
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:25,810
OK. Meeting called on account
of weird scary thing.

150
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:27,862
Let's go.

151
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:30,689
Hmm. Foragers...

152
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:35,387
Hammy, what weird thing?

153
00:11:35,587 --> 00:11:38,490
Oh. That weird thing.

154
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:08,186
It never ends!

155
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:12,569
Whoa!

156
00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:14,617
Hey!

157
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:16,844
It never ends that way too!

158
00:12:17,044 --> 00:12:18,872
- Jeepers, Lou.
- Whoa.

159
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:20,874
Yeah, jeepers
is the word there, hon.

160
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:24,536
- I've never seen anything like this.
- Man, that's big.

161
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:30,041
- What is this thing?
- Heather, no!

162
00:12:30,241 --> 00:12:32,135
- I'm scared.
- Me too, Mama.

163
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:36,506
Shh! It's OK, it's just a...
What is this thing, Lou?

164
00:12:36,706 --> 00:12:39,404
I... Well, it's a...
It's... Verne?

165
00:12:39,604 --> 00:12:42,303
Well, it's, uh...
it's obviously...

166
00:12:42,503 --> 00:12:43,855
...some kind of bush?

167
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:46,765
I'd be less afraid of it if I
just knew what it was called.

168
00:12:46,965 --> 00:12:48,776
- Let's call it Steve!
- Steve?

169
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:51,062
- It's a pretty name.
- Steve sounds nice.

170
00:12:51,262 --> 00:12:53,356
I'm a lot less
scared of Steve.

171
00:12:53,556 --> 00:12:55,450
Oh, great
and powerful Steve!

172
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:59,153
- What do you want?
- I don't think it can speak.

173
00:12:59,353 --> 00:13:00,655
I heard that,
young man!

174
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:04,200
- You get over here right now!
- OK.

175
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,626
Hammy, get back here.

176
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:08,622
- Steve is angry!
- It came from the other side of Steve.

177
00:13:08,822 --> 00:13:11,583
I mean the bush.
I mean... Jeez!

178
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:16,671
There's only one way we're gonna
find out what this thing is,

179
00:13:16,871 --> 00:13:19,758
and what this is all about.
I'm gonna go check it out.

180
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,437
Aah!

181
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:26,373
Ay yai yai.

182
00:13:26,573 --> 00:13:29,109
Uh... Aah!

183
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,152
Steve ate Verne!

184
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:35,569
All right, Steve,
you brought this on yourself.

185
00:13:35,769 --> 00:13:39,800
Stella, don't!
I'm not eaten, I just tripped.

186
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,031
I'm gonna go over there.
Just don't anybody move.

187
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:56,919
Kids, come on,
hurry up! You'll be late!

188
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:03,842
Gary,
come on, breakfast!

189
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,268
What is this place?

190
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:24,806
Oh, hey there, little...

191
00:14:25,006 --> 00:14:26,249
Ohh!

192
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:29,206
...fella. Ugh!

193
00:14:29,406 --> 00:14:32,163
Oh!

194
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:35,838
Hi.

195
00:14:36,038 --> 00:14:37,469
Aah!

196
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:40,797
Oh!

197
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:49,889
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

198
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:51,808
Ow.

199
00:14:57,731 --> 00:15:00,692
Whoa! Ohh!

200
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:10,835
Operator.
Can I help you?

201
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,872
No, I can talk.
I'm just driving.

202
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:29,979
Aaah!

203
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,731
Verne's back.

204
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:32,982
- Verne!
- Jeepers!

205
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:34,984
- You OK?
- Help him up.

206
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:37,904
- What was over there?
- Freaky pink primates!

207
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:41,174
They must have come while we
were hibernating. It was awful.

208
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:44,244
They had wheels on their feet
and these sticks, and they were

209
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:47,697
whacking me with these sticks like
it was some sort of sick game.

210
00:15:47,897 --> 00:15:51,534
You should have died!
You should have laid down and died.

211
00:15:51,734 --> 00:15:53,661
- Dad.
- That's not the worst part.

212
00:15:53,861 --> 00:15:56,130
Half the forest is gone.

213
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,983
The oak trees
and the berry bushes,

214
00:15:59,183 --> 00:16:01,836
they're just...
they're just gone.

215
00:16:02,036 --> 00:16:03,096
Jeepers.

216
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,844
What'll we do for food?

217
00:16:06,044 --> 00:16:08,393
How are we gonna live?

218
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:10,811
I don't know.
But here's what I do know.

219
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:14,941
We will be fine as long as no
one goes over Steve again.

220
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:19,813
It's called a hedge, and it is not
to be feared, my amphibious friend.

221
00:16:20,013 --> 00:16:23,065
It is the gateway
to the good life.

222
00:16:23,265 --> 00:16:24,992
Uh, I'm a reptile,
actually.

223
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:27,403
But, you know,
it's a common mistake.

224
00:16:27,603 --> 00:16:28,788
And, uh, you are?

225
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:32,333
Oh. Where are my manners.
I'm RJ.

226
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:35,587
Don't think I'm prying,
but I couldn't help overhearing,

227
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:40,291
and I can shed a little light on what
this whole hedge situation is about.

228
00:16:40,491 --> 00:16:42,135
You see, what was
once mere wilderness

229
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:46,965
is now 54 acres of man-made,
manicured, air-conditioned paradise.

230
00:16:47,165 --> 00:16:49,976
Except for that little-bitty speck.
You are here.

231
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:53,805
No, no, that's a good thing.
You're hibernators, right?

232
00:16:54,005 --> 00:16:56,223
You gather up food,
store it for the winter?

233
00:16:56,423 --> 00:16:58,809
- Uh-huh. We fill the log!
- Hammy.

234
00:16:59,009 --> 00:17:01,603
Really? This log?
This cave-like log?

235
00:17:01,803 --> 00:17:03,960
- All the way to the top.
- Ozzie.

236
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,117
Let me ask ya,
how long's it take?

237
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:09,821
- You know, to fill the log?
- Two hundred and seventy-four days.

238
00:17:10,021 --> 00:17:13,616
- Ohh! Ever done it in a week?
- That's impossible.

239
00:17:13,816 --> 00:17:15,251
Not if we work together.

240
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:18,162
You've got the food gathering skills,
I've got the know-how,

241
00:17:18,362 --> 00:17:20,089
- and they have the food!
- How much food?

242
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:23,421
Loads of food. Heaps of food.
Food out the wazoo!

243
00:17:23,621 --> 00:17:26,754
Well, whatever kind of food
comes out of a wazoo,

244
00:17:26,954 --> 00:17:28,556
I don't think
we're interested in eating.

245
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,809
I don't know,
the guy's making a lot of sense to me.

246
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:34,345
- I think we should listen.
- Yeah, I'm OK with wazoo food there.

247
00:17:34,545 --> 00:17:37,524
No, you're not.
The tail is tingling.

248
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:40,860
- Why didn't you say so?
- Hold on, hold on. The what is what?

249
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,146
When something doesn't feel right,
my tail tingles. Let me tell you,

250
00:17:44,346 --> 00:17:46,866
everything you've said so far
is driving my tail crazy.

251
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:51,195
Listen. Verne, right? This isn't
something you need to be afraid of.

252
00:17:51,395 --> 00:17:54,615
Well, I am.
And for good reason.

253
00:17:54,815 --> 00:17:56,042
This is not a birthmark.

254
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:59,119
That's because you went
over there without a guide.

255
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:01,297
Thanks for stopping by.
We're not interested.

256
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:05,084
Not interested in the most
delicious food you've ever tasted?

257
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:07,273
- No!
- Come on.

258
00:18:07,473 --> 00:18:09,786
Not interested!

259
00:18:09,986 --> 00:18:12,099
OK. I get it.

260
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:18,347
I understand. This is something
that you're just not open to.

261
00:18:18,547 --> 00:18:21,100
Wow!

262
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,656
Whoa!

263
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:28,816
- Oh, my!
- Jeepers.

264
00:18:29,016 --> 00:18:30,744
What is that?

265
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:34,743
That, my friend,
is a magical combination of corn flour,

266
00:18:34,943 --> 00:18:38,743
dehydrated cheese solids,
BHA, BHT and good old MSG,

267
00:18:38,943 --> 00:18:42,714
a.k.a., the chip.
Nacho cheese flavor.

268
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:45,917
- Over here! Toss me one of those!
- More please! More.

269
00:18:46,117 --> 00:18:47,927
Yeah, Verne,
those were good!

270
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,922
It's all good.
And we're going over there. Tonight!

271
00:18:51,122 --> 00:18:53,725
Yeah!

272
00:18:53,925 --> 00:18:56,702
Welcome to suburbia.

273
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:59,680
- Wow!
- Look at that!

274
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:04,272
Hey, Mom, look at us!
Look at us!

275
00:19:04,472 --> 00:19:07,229
Oh, my!
Hon, look at this.

276
00:19:07,429 --> 00:19:08,656
Jeepers.

277
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:10,032
How's that tail, Verne?

278
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:12,693
Listen, if anybody
in this family gets hurt,

279
00:19:12,893 --> 00:19:14,495
I'm holding you responsible.

280
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:18,783
They're having a good time.
I'll take responsibility for that.

281
00:19:18,983 --> 00:19:20,209
- This is neat.
- Look at that.

282
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,253
- Hey, Spike, look at that.
- Hey, Verno,

283
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:25,665
I took a few clippings out of my
quills to do a little comparison.

284
00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:28,772
Look at this,
the grass seems to be greener over here.

285
00:19:28,972 --> 00:19:31,879
Verne, are you certain
you came to the same place?

286
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:33,881
Yeah, 'cause
the raccoon says...

287
00:19:34,081 --> 00:19:35,683
OK, enough about him.
I get it.

288
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:39,846
So he can do a couple of tricks.
I mean, it's not like he can walk on water.

289
00:19:40,046 --> 00:19:43,016
Hey, everybody!
This way to the food!

290
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:47,169
- That thing's huge!
- What is that?

291
00:19:47,369 --> 00:19:49,572
That is an SUV.
Humans ride around in it

292
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:52,925
because they are slowly
losing their ability to walk.

293
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:56,278
- Jeepers, it's so big!
- How many humans fit in there?

294
00:19:56,478 --> 00:19:58,790
Usually? One.

295
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:01,747
Hi, this is Gladys Sharp.
Your president?

296
00:20:01,947 --> 00:20:04,704
Of the homeowner's
association? Right.

297
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:06,172
- Jeepers.
- What is that?

298
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:09,379
Easy, easy, don't worry.
That's just a human being.

299
00:20:09,579 --> 00:20:12,630
And they are just as scared
of us as we are of them.

300
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:15,682
Now, if a human does happen
to see you, just lay down,

301
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:19,352
roll over and give your privates
a good licking. They love it.

302
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:23,430
The charter, which you signed,
says the grass is supposed to be two inches,

303
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:26,818
and according to my measuring stick,
yours is 2.5.

304
00:20:27,018 --> 00:20:30,947
Could we just get the food and go?
Really, do they have it or not?

305
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:35,359
Didn't you see it? It was in the box.
They've always got food with them.

306
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:38,362
We eat to live,
these guys live to eat.

307
00:20:38,562 --> 00:20:41,165
Let me show you
what I'm talking about.

308
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:43,934
The human mouth
is called a "pie hole."

309
00:20:44,134 --> 00:20:46,704
The human being
is called a "couch potato."

310
00:20:46,904 --> 00:20:49,131
That is a device
to summon food.

311
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:52,218
That is one of the many
voices of food.

312
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:55,054
That is the portal for
the passing of the food.

313
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:58,799
That is one of the many food
transportation vehicles.

314
00:20:58,999 --> 00:21:01,218
Humans bring the food,
take the food,

315
00:21:01,418 --> 00:21:03,437
ship the food,
they drive the food,

316
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:07,767
they wear the food! That gets the food hot.
That keeps the food cold.

317
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:10,436
That...
I'm not sure what that is.

318
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:11,863
Aah!

319
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,407
What do you know? Food!

320
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:17,510
That is the altar
where they worship food.

321
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:20,413
That's what they eat
when they eat too much.

322
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:23,323
That gets rid of guilt
so they can eat more food.

323
00:21:23,523 --> 00:21:26,119
Food! Food! Food! Food!

324
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:27,628
Food!

325
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:30,965
So you think
they have enough?

326
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:34,844
Well, they don't.
For humans, enough is never enough!

327
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:39,048
And what do they do with
the stuff they don't eat?

328
00:21:39,248 --> 00:21:43,469
They put it in gleaming,
silver cans,

329
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:44,804
just for us.

330
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:49,108
Sweet jeepers.

331
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,685
Dig in!

332
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:55,698
- Good, isn't it?
- OK.

333
00:21:55,898 --> 00:22:00,870
- Wow.
- Share there, everyone, share.

334
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:05,370
That's a diaper.
And that does come out of a wazoo.

335
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:09,870
So, what do you think?
Was I right or was I right?

336
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,798
And these things
are just the scraps!

337
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:15,251
Wait'll you see what comes in the boxes,
packages and cans!

338
00:22:15,451 --> 00:22:17,753
I'm telling you,
stick with me, and in one week

339
00:22:17,953 --> 00:22:20,380
we will gather
enough food to...

340
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,558
- To feed a bear.
- What?

341
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:25,678
- Just a figure of speech.

342
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:31,349
Halt! Intruders! Intruders!
Get out, all of you.

343
00:22:31,549 --> 00:22:34,278
What is it, baby?

344
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:37,606
- What are you doing?
- You said to lick our...

345
00:22:37,806 --> 00:22:39,993
No! Nix that! Run!

346
00:22:40,193 --> 00:22:41,652
- Run!
- Get outta here!

347
00:22:41,852 --> 00:22:44,204
Run!

348
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:45,832
- Shoo!
- To the hedge!

349
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:48,868
Get out of here!
I just mopped this patio!

350
00:22:49,068 --> 00:22:50,995
Filthy vermin!

351
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:56,834
Verne's right,
that was horrible.

352
00:22:57,034 --> 00:22:58,803
- You kids OK?
- Stay close.

353
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:02,715
- We'll find other food, right?
- See? That's what I was talking about!

354
00:23:02,915 --> 00:23:04,558
These humans
don't want us around.

355
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:07,870
So we scared her, and she overreacted.
No biggie.

356
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:10,982
No biggie? Oh, that is
what we call a biggie.

357
00:23:11,182 --> 00:23:14,560
Come on, think about the food.
It was worth it for that food, huh?

358
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,229
That stuff is to die for!

359
00:23:18,356 --> 00:23:19,615
Let me rephrase that.

360
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:22,451
No, to die for.
You nailed that part.

361
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:26,780
Look, maybe our little forest life
looks primitive to a guy with a bag.

362
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,499
- What?
- But I think I speak

363
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:31,623
for the whole family
when I say we want nothing

364
00:23:31,823 --> 00:23:34,747
to do with anything
that's over that hedge.

365
00:23:34,947 --> 00:23:36,883
- Oh, come on!
- I'm done.

366
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:40,711
You haven't even tried doughnuts yet!
You wanna store fat?

367
00:23:40,911 --> 00:23:42,880
That is the way
to store some fat.

368
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,849
You'll be sweatin'
through the winter!

369
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:49,387
- We'll eat the bark, right?
- OK, all right, you guys sleep on it!

370
00:23:49,587 --> 00:23:52,932
Good idea. I'm gonna
check back with you.

371
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:56,069
Shoot!

372
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:58,520
Almost had 'em.

373
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,324
Good night, Heather.
- Good night.

374
00:24:06,524 --> 00:24:08,032
- Good night, Ozzie.
- Good night.

375
00:24:08,232 --> 00:24:09,595
- Good night, Lou.
- Good night.

376
00:24:09,795 --> 00:24:10,958
- Night, Penny.
- Good night.

377
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:12,868
- Good night, Hammy.
- Good night.

378
00:24:13,068 --> 00:24:14,294
- Night, Bucky.
- Good night.

379
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:16,563
- Good night, Spike.
- Good night, Uncle Verne.

380
00:24:16,763 --> 00:24:18,632
- Good night, Quillo.
- Night, Uncle Verne.

381
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:21,252
When we wake up,
only 273 days left till winter.

382
00:24:21,452 --> 00:24:25,256
- That's enough, Verne.
- Good night, 273.

383
00:24:27,341 --> 00:24:28,893
Spuddies...

384
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:34,098
Cooler... Wagon...
Redder wagon.

385
00:24:34,298 --> 00:24:36,150
Time's up, RJ.

386
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:38,978
But I have
six more days! No!

387
00:24:39,178 --> 00:24:40,729
No! Aaah!

388
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:45,701
OK. Four paws, fur.

389
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:48,746
Still alive, still alive.

390
00:24:48,946 --> 00:24:51,657
So, what are you saying?
You want me to take 'em to his house?

391
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:53,742
- No.
- Then what are you saying?

392
00:24:53,942 --> 00:24:55,628
Jimmy was pushing me
on the bus.

393
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:58,001
- He likes you.
- No way, he's a creep.

394
00:24:58,201 --> 00:25:00,374
Next time he shoves you,
beat him up.

395
00:25:00,574 --> 00:25:02,418
Yes!

396
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:10,009
OK, kids, dive in. There it is.
Bark for breakfast!

397
00:25:10,209 --> 00:25:13,012
- I want a doughnut!
- I want pizza.

398
00:25:13,212 --> 00:25:14,347
No, you don't.

399
00:25:30,821 --> 00:25:34,700
OK. This is great.

400
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:42,833
Granted, it takes
some time to chew.

401
00:25:43,033 --> 00:25:45,511
But that...

402
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:47,596
That was very satisfying.

403
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:51,133
And, by the way,
lots of fiber in there too.

404
00:25:51,333 --> 00:25:52,685
Mmm!

405
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:56,763
- Lots.
- I gotta admit, that does look tasty.

406
00:25:56,963 --> 00:25:58,565
What are you doing here?

407
00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:02,978
I'm here to help you with your...
foraging thing.

408
00:26:03,178 --> 00:26:04,446
Look, Verne,

409
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:07,691
you said a word yesterday
about your little gang here.

410
00:26:07,891 --> 00:26:10,777
It starts with an F,
do you remember what it was?

411
00:26:10,977 --> 00:26:13,029
- Family?
- Right, right, that.

412
00:26:13,229 --> 00:26:15,082
You know,
that got me right here.

413
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:18,227
You see, Verne, I used
to have all of that.

414
00:26:18,427 --> 00:26:21,372
My own place,
surrounded by loved ones,

415
00:26:21,572 --> 00:26:22,965
universal remote.

416
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:25,792
But then all that
went away with...

417
00:26:25,992 --> 00:26:27,420
...the weed hacker
incident.

418
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:28,595
Oh, God.

419
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:31,557
Oh, come here.

420
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:34,138
Yeah, that feels good,
doesn't it?

421
00:26:34,338 --> 00:26:36,520
- Oh, brother.
- Jeepers, Verne.

422
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,931
We could always use the extra hand there,
you know.

423
00:26:39,131 --> 00:26:43,018
The weed hacker, Verne.
The weed hacker.

424
00:26:43,218 --> 00:26:44,737
OK.

425
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:49,691
Not your problem.
I'll just go.

426
00:26:49,891 --> 00:26:51,234
This is me...

427
00:26:51,434 --> 00:26:52,578
...going.

428
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:54,372
- Been nice.
- Don't hit.

429
00:26:54,572 --> 00:26:55,998
Really nice
getting to know you.

430
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:59,076
Hey, I'm sure I'll see you
around the forest.

431
00:26:59,276 --> 00:27:01,287
- Take care.
- All right, all right.

432
00:27:01,487 --> 00:27:04,257
Hey, uh, RJ?

433
00:27:04,457 --> 00:27:05,966
You can... you can stay.

434
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:08,969
Come here, ya big lug!
- No.

435
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:11,404
I knew beneath this hard,
crispy outside

436
00:27:11,604 --> 00:27:13,640
there was a soft,
nougat-y center in there.

437
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,719
- Do you mind if I call you Uncle Verne?
- With every bone in my body.

438
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:20,847
Great. Hey,
can I work with Hammy?

439
00:27:21,047 --> 00:27:22,524
Wanna help me find my nuts?

440
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:25,147
Very tempting, Hammy,
very tempting.

441
00:27:25,347 --> 00:27:27,481
But first,
I want to show you this.

442
00:27:27,681 --> 00:27:29,815
You like this cookie?

443
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:31,075
Ohh ho ho ho!

444
00:27:31,275 --> 00:27:33,986
- Well, this cookie's junk!
- I like a cookie.

445
00:27:34,186 --> 00:27:35,413
Easy, easy. Don't worry.

446
00:27:35,613 --> 00:27:39,099
I know where we can get
some cookies so valuable

447
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:42,586
that they are hand delivered
by uniformed officers.

448
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:45,998
- The Doyles' is the yellow house.
- They only ordered one box.

449
00:27:46,198 --> 00:27:48,134
There they are.
America's most coveted cookies.

450
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:52,296
Love Handles, Skinny Mints,
Neener Neeners and Smackeroons.

451
00:27:52,496 --> 00:27:55,591
- And guess what? They're all yours!
- Hoo hoo! Aah!

452
00:27:55,791 --> 00:27:58,644
Whoa, Hamilton.
Hold on there, fella.

453
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:00,871
I love your energy,
but you can't take 'em.

454
00:28:01,071 --> 00:28:02,898
- You said they're mine.
- They will be,

455
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:07,353
if we successfully marry your
manic energy to my brilliant plan!

456
00:28:07,553 --> 00:28:09,188
- You with me, kid?
- I... I... I...

457
00:28:09,388 --> 00:28:10,823
The I's have it!
Let's ride.

458
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:13,651
Mrs. Johansson
was allergic to chocolate.

459
00:28:13,851 --> 00:28:15,328
- Really?
- Yeah, if she eats it,

460
00:28:15,528 --> 00:28:19,490
- her face explodes or something.
- That is, like, so unfair.

461
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:21,625
- Wait, wait. How many boxes of...?
- Hey!

462
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:24,077
You stay away from those cookies.
They're mine!

463
00:28:24,277 --> 00:28:25,921
- Ahem!
- Aah!

464
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:28,874
This guy's not coming, is he?
I don't want him to.

465
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:31,427
Oh, we have
so much work to do.

466
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:34,138
Come on, step into my office.
Now, listen up.

467
00:28:34,338 --> 00:28:37,966
What we're going for here is a vicious,
man-eating, rabid squirrel.

468
00:28:38,166 --> 00:28:40,093
- Can you handle that?
- Um, excuse me?

469
00:28:40,293 --> 00:28:41,979
Yes... Hammy.

470
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:46,392
OK. Rabbits aren't vicious.
They're all cute and cuddly, so...

471
00:28:46,592 --> 00:28:48,810
Rabid, not rabbit.

472
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:51,364
Oh... What?

473
00:28:51,564 --> 00:28:54,483
- OK. So first we're gonna muss the hair.
- Ow, ow, ow!

474
00:28:54,683 --> 00:28:56,694
That's looking good.
All right, now we're gonna...

475
00:28:56,894 --> 00:28:59,205
We're gonna
mat the fur a little bit.

476
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:02,032
A little puff on the tail...
Stop it! Puffier.

477
00:29:02,232 --> 00:29:03,209
Liking that a lot.

478
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:06,462
Show me that wild look
in your eye. Come on!

479
00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:11,128
- Oh! I can burp my ABCs! A, B, C.
- Hammy!

480
00:29:11,328 --> 00:29:15,795
I just really need you
to focus right now, OK?

481
00:29:15,995 --> 00:29:17,014
- OK.
- Thank you.

482
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:19,633
Let's see. There we...
Hang on a minute.

483
00:29:19,833 --> 00:29:22,886
Not that, not that.
No, no. Aha!

484
00:29:23,086 --> 00:29:26,223
- Nice!
- Ooh!

485
00:29:26,423 --> 00:29:28,100
Hammy?

486
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:35,774
Done! Now, come on.
I'll be right behind you.

487
00:29:35,974 --> 00:29:38,618
Go on, get out there.
Shoo, shoo!

488
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:43,616
I am a crazy rabid squirrel!
I want my cookies!

489
00:29:43,816 --> 00:29:46,210
I'm rabid!

490
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:48,546
I'm foaming at the mouth.

491
00:29:48,746 --> 00:29:52,583
I'm foaming,
very scary rabid squirrel.

492
00:29:52,783 --> 00:29:53,800
Rabies!

493
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,319
- Hey, it's working!
- Behind you!

494
00:29:56,519 --> 00:29:58,838
I know.
You're right behind me...

495
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:00,349
Got it! Stand back!

496
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:03,969
- No, no, no, no! Oh, no!
- Take that!

497
00:30:04,169 --> 00:30:05,804
Walk it off!
Walk that one off!

498
00:30:06,004 --> 00:30:07,440
What's going on?
Is that Hammy?

499
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,559
- Everything's under control. Go back.
- You call that under control?

500
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:12,727
- He's under attack!
- He's working!

501
00:30:12,927 --> 00:30:15,021
- I'm coming, Hammy!
- Verne! No!

502
00:30:15,221 --> 00:30:17,316
What are you doing?
Watch out!

503
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:27,826
- Hold still! I got it! Stay still.
- Help me! Get off of me!

504
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:30,045
- Yuck!
- Gross!

505
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:32,748
- Eww! Nasty!
- Eww, eww! Oh, my God, this is so gross!

506
00:30:32,948 --> 00:30:33,924
Verne!

507
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:37,670
That was great!
You, my friend, are a natural.

508
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:41,465
Or, should I say, au naturel.

509
00:30:41,665 --> 00:30:43,258
Huh?

510
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:46,103
Oh.

511
00:30:46,303 --> 00:30:48,522
Hammy, you were awesome,
my man!

512
00:30:48,722 --> 00:30:52,892
You had me scared. I was about to come
out and beat you with a book myself.

513
00:30:53,092 --> 00:30:56,292
You're all right, aren't ya?
Of course you are. You are Hammy!

514
00:30:56,492 --> 00:30:59,692
Those bruises are gonna heal.
You know what? Chicks dig scars.

515
00:30:59,892 --> 00:31:01,660
- There!
- Over there!

516
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:05,322
That's where the squirrel attacked us!
He has rabies or something.

517
00:31:05,522 --> 00:31:07,700
There was this gross,
naked, amphibian thing.

518
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:10,461
- Reptile.
- It's OK, girls.

519
00:31:10,661 --> 00:31:13,622
Go inside, have a cookie,
turn on the TV and calm down.

520
00:31:13,822 --> 00:31:15,132
Thanks, Mom.

521
00:31:15,332 --> 00:31:19,002
I'm sorry, Janis,
did I just hear them say "rabid squirrel"?

522
00:31:19,202 --> 00:31:21,054
Oh, I think they might
just be overreacting.

523
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:24,924
What if they're not? What if we have
a potential pandemic on our hands?

524
00:31:25,124 --> 00:31:27,260
Vermin running loose,
spreading disease

525
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:30,564
and lowering
our property values?

526
00:31:30,764 --> 00:31:34,017
Yeah. I have a casserole
in the oven. Gotta run.

527
00:31:34,217 --> 00:31:36,069
Fine. Worry about
your casserole,

528
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:40,774
and I'll worry about the end of
suburban peace and tranquility!

529
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:46,029
That's right. Don't push.
Plenty for everybody.

530
00:31:46,229 --> 00:31:48,448
Got a box right over here
for ya, Penny.

531
00:31:48,648 --> 00:31:50,209
That is good. Eat up!

532
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:52,794
Anything that tastes this good
has to be good for you.

533
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:56,173
Feel buzzing in the back of your skull?
That's called a sugar rush.

534
00:31:56,373 --> 00:32:01,211
It's what keeps humans going, why they
don't hibernate. Add a little of this,

535
00:32:01,411 --> 00:32:05,006
and what usually takes you
all summer will take us a week.

536
00:32:05,206 --> 00:32:06,517
I like it! I like it!

537
00:32:06,717 --> 00:32:10,846
Hold on, Hamsquad.
The last thing you need is caffeine.

538
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:14,525
That's right.
Come on, dig in.

539
00:32:14,725 --> 00:32:17,811
Because this, my friends,
is just the beginning.

540
00:32:18,011 --> 00:32:19,354
What?

541
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:23,779
<i>Follow me
into the great unknown</i>

542
00:32:23,979 --> 00:32:26,342
<i>Where pink flamingoes grow</i>

543
00:32:26,542 --> 00:32:28,706
<i>Diet soda flows</i>

544
00:32:28,906 --> 00:32:34,578
<i>And what you take
magically regenerates</i>

545
00:32:34,778 --> 00:32:36,672
<i>On supermarket shelves</i>

546
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:38,591
<i>The ovens
clean themselves</i>

547
00:32:38,791 --> 00:32:41,422
<i>You don't pay the tab
'til the last drop</i>

548
00:32:41,622 --> 00:32:44,254
- Up, down! Up, down!
- He's getting away!

549
00:32:44,454 --> 00:32:45,598
Oh, yeah!

550
00:32:45,798 --> 00:32:49,676
<i>'Cause this train
never stops</i>

551
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,601
Ohh!

552
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:11,531
<i>We make a good team
me and you, we do</i>

553
00:33:11,731 --> 00:33:13,459
<i>You can scratch my back</i>

554
00:33:13,659 --> 00:33:16,161
<i>And I'll scratch
my back too</i>

555
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:18,705
Read it and weep.

556
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:23,469
<i>People, more is more</i>

557
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:25,429
<i>Ah, we all want more</i>

558
00:33:25,629 --> 00:33:30,216
<i>You don't pay the tab
'till the last drop</i>

559
00:33:30,416 --> 00:33:32,936
<i>So we all ride for nothing</i>

560
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:35,931
<i>'Cause this train
never stops</i>

561
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:43,605
Hello? I need every business listing
you have under "exterminator."

562
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:10,716
<i>You don't stop
You don't stop</i>

563
00:34:10,916 --> 00:34:12,476
<i>You don't stop</i>

564
00:34:12,676 --> 00:34:15,261
Ozzie!

565
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:19,683
- Whoa, Mom! You hit a possum.
- Oh, my goodness.

566
00:34:19,883 --> 00:34:20,934
Do you think it's dead?

567
00:34:21,134 --> 00:34:22,611
Oh, no.

568
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:24,697
- Wow!
- Touch it.

569
00:34:24,897 --> 00:34:26,448
- Can I poke him?
- No!

570
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:28,659
These poor
little creatures.

571
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:31,328
- What's going on?
- Come check it out.

572
00:34:31,528 --> 00:34:35,407
Debbie? I don't remember seeing
a permit app for a gathering.

573
00:34:35,607 --> 00:34:37,993
Groups of more than one
who wish to get... Aah!

574
00:34:38,193 --> 00:34:40,871
Timmy, get the shovel
from the car.

575
00:34:45,042 --> 00:34:48,216
Lights fading,
limbs growing cold.

576
00:34:48,416 --> 00:34:51,590
- I see a tunnel.
- Oh, no.

577
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:58,597
Mother, is that you
beckoning me into the light?

578
00:34:58,797 --> 00:35:01,233
Must move toward the light.

579
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:05,395
- What do you think he's doing?
- Maybe we knocked his brains loose.

580
00:35:05,595 --> 00:35:08,815
You went too far.
Let's get out of here and leave this...

581
00:35:09,015 --> 00:35:10,200
This...

582
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,245
- Nice catch, Verne.
- Yes! Yes!

583
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:18,033
- You're dangerous. You're insane!
- Sweet music, I'm going home!

584
00:35:19,743 --> 00:35:23,413
Goodbye, cruel world!

585
00:35:23,613 --> 00:35:25,465
Ooh! Ooh!

586
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:29,836
Rosebud.

587
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:35,642
- Now can I poke him?
- No!

588
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:39,596
You see? This is exactly why
I called the exterminator.

589
00:35:39,796 --> 00:35:42,140
To kill them before
they get hurt like this.

590
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,983
Everybody,
get out of here right now!

591
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:46,961
Right! Kids, grab those handles.
Get the stuff.

592
00:35:47,161 --> 00:35:49,940
- What?
- Here we go. I threw out my back.

593
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:55,403
- Let's go.
- Get down.

594
00:36:11,962 --> 00:36:13,421
Oh, no.

595
00:36:18,802 --> 00:36:23,056
I believe someone phoned
about an animal problem?

596
00:36:23,256 --> 00:36:25,809
The solution
is standing before you.

597
00:36:26,009 --> 00:36:29,195
Dwayne LaFontant is here.

598
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:33,358
Where have you been? I'm throwing a
"Welcome to the Neighborhood" party,

599
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:36,319
and so far Debbie's car has killed
more animals than you have.

600
00:36:36,519 --> 00:36:38,425
Stand down, sister.

601
00:36:38,625 --> 00:36:40,332
I personally guarantee

602
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:43,618
that there will not be a
living thing at this party.

603
00:36:43,818 --> 00:36:45,912
The Verminator
is on the job.

604
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:48,882
Leave it. Leave it!

605
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:51,551
What do we have here?

606
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:55,130
Didelphis marsupialis
virginianus.

607
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:56,473
Approximately ten pounds.

608
00:36:56,673 --> 00:37:00,185
Male.

609
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:02,228
- I think he's dead.
- Oh, really?

610
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:06,058
Do you, in fact,
have an associates degree from Vermtech?

611
00:37:06,258 --> 00:37:07,934
I think he wants you
to think he's dead.

612
00:37:08,134 --> 00:37:09,444
- Go! Go!
- Move, move!

613
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:12,234
- That's it! Run! Go!
- ...voluntary shock state.

614
00:37:12,434 --> 00:37:14,825
Look at him closely.
You can see him breathing.

615
00:37:15,025 --> 00:37:18,011
I certainly hope
he's not in any pain.

616
00:37:18,211 --> 00:37:20,998
- What the...?
- Aah! Kill it! Kill it!

617
00:37:21,198 --> 00:37:23,950
Thank you all for coming!
You were a great audience!

618
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:25,493
Oh, man!

619
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:30,606
All right, what am I
up against here?

620
00:37:30,806 --> 00:37:33,972
Possum, porcupine,
skunk, squirrel,

621
00:37:34,172 --> 00:37:37,338
raccoon...
amphibian.

622
00:37:37,538 --> 00:37:40,466
- Reptile.
- No.

623
00:37:40,666 --> 00:37:42,594
Reptile.

624
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:49,350
That's what I call a
super-duper performance there.

625
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:51,144
- I wanna do it again!
- Beyond super.

626
00:37:51,344 --> 00:37:52,938
They were riveted.
You were awesome!

627
00:37:53,138 --> 00:37:55,323
All right!

628
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:59,444
Dad. I just gotta say, that was, uh...
that was pretty good.

629
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:03,118
Props for the Ozman!

630
00:38:03,318 --> 00:38:05,250
- Ozman!
- Yeah! Yeah!

631
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:08,203
But let's not forget
our brilliant leadership:

632
00:38:08,403 --> 00:38:09,629
RJ.

633
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:10,923
RJ!

634
00:38:11,123 --> 00:38:12,841
Brilliant!

635
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:16,544
RJ, come this way.
We wanna show you something.

636
00:38:16,744 --> 00:38:18,555
- Yeah, sure.
- Sweet.

637
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:21,507
- What a team!
- That raccoon knows what he's doing.

638
00:38:21,707 --> 00:38:24,052
You're my hero there,
fella.

639
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:29,566
- Over here, this way.
- RJ, come on!

640
00:38:29,766 --> 00:38:32,518
Yeah, we wanna show you
something. Come on, hurry!

641
00:38:32,718 --> 00:38:34,604
Check it out.

642
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:39,734
Your new home!

643
00:38:44,114 --> 00:38:47,575
And look, we got
a place for you right here!

644
00:38:47,775 --> 00:38:48,668
That's for me?

645
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:52,793
Yeah, is this anything
like what you had, RJ?

646
00:38:52,993 --> 00:38:56,718
This isn't anything
like what I had, Lou.

647
00:38:56,918 --> 00:39:00,379
- Here, I'm not supposed to drink this.
- Thanks.

648
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:04,471
- Is that my bag?
- Yeah, we brought it in here

649
00:39:04,671 --> 00:39:06,678
so you wouldn't have
to sleep in that tree.

650
00:39:06,878 --> 00:39:09,064
Really? Wow.

651
00:39:09,264 --> 00:39:12,067
Hey, RJ, check this out!
We totally hooked up the TV.

652
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:16,562
- I hot-wired the HD converter.
- We get a thousand channels!

653
00:39:16,762 --> 00:39:18,940
Can you take the remote
before my dad does?

654
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:21,901
Wow. A universal remote?

655
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:27,874
This is nice, guys.
Really nice.

656
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:31,086
<i>We now return to</i>
A Scoundrel Among Us.

657
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:33,088
<i>You should be
ashamed of yourself.</i>

658
00:39:33,288 --> 00:39:35,757
<i>We let you into our family,
and you've deceived us.</i>

659
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:39,928
<i>I gave you my heart,
and you ripped it into a million pieces.</i>

660
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:42,614
<i>Get real, Kevin.
When you feel like a dirtbag,</i>

661
00:39:42,814 --> 00:39:45,100
<i>it's because
you're a dirtbag.</i>

662
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:50,222
<i>Right? So just own it, just say it out loud.
"I am a dirtbag."</i>

663
00:39:50,422 --> 00:39:53,850
Dirtbag.
I don't think that guy's a real doctor.

664
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:57,020
What do you think there,
RJ? RJ?

665
00:40:00,273 --> 00:40:02,408
Whoa. Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, RJ.

666
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:06,696
What are you doing, man?
You are getting in way too deep.

667
00:40:06,896 --> 00:40:08,081
Just get the food.

668
00:40:08,281 --> 00:40:10,533
Feed the bear.
Get the food.

669
00:40:10,733 --> 00:40:11,960
Feed the bear.
Whaah!

670
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,704
Where's the food?
Where's the food?!

671
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:25,306
Verne. What are you doing?

672
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:27,825
Getting things back
to the way they were.

673
00:40:28,025 --> 00:40:30,145
- No, don't. How about I just leave?
- Good.

674
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:32,972
You leave, and I return this
stuff to the rightful owners.

675
00:40:33,172 --> 00:40:34,399
What?! Why?

676
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:37,110
Because we've angered
the humans.

677
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:39,445
And we don't wanna end up
like that rabbit.

678
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:43,883
Hence, I'm giving this back
so they won't kill us.

679
00:40:44,083 --> 00:40:48,321
Verne, you don't understand!
We need this stuff!

680
00:40:48,521 --> 00:40:49,831
No, we don't!

681
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:52,242
You can't take it!

682
00:40:52,442 --> 00:40:53,210
Yes, I can!

683
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:55,895
- Let go!
- You let go!

684
00:40:56,095 --> 00:40:58,581
- I have to have it.
- No!

685
00:40:58,781 --> 00:41:00,792
Stop!

686
00:41:11,136 --> 00:41:14,847
Verne. Move slow,
keep your voice low and follow me.

687
00:41:15,047 --> 00:41:17,496
- What?
- Shh!

688
00:41:17,696 --> 00:41:19,945
- No.
- Shh!

689
00:41:20,145 --> 00:41:25,075
No. I'm not falling for any
more of your smooth talk!

690
00:41:25,275 --> 00:41:29,570
I don't know what you're up to,
but my entire shell is tingling.

691
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:31,655
Know what? I'm listening
to it this time,

692
00:41:31,855 --> 00:41:33,741
- and I'm putting my foot down.
- No, no.

693
00:41:35,285 --> 00:41:36,795
Play?

694
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:40,165
Huh? Oh! Huh?

695
00:41:40,365 --> 00:41:42,259
Play!

696
00:41:42,459 --> 00:41:43,635
Play! Play! Play!

697
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:47,422
Play! Play! Play!
Play! Play!

698
00:41:47,622 --> 00:41:49,757
Aaah! Oof!

699
00:41:49,957 --> 00:41:51,843
Play!

700
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:01,227
Let's play!

701
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:05,240
Play!

702
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,533
Jeez... Aah!

703
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:10,678
Play! Play! Play!
Play! Play! Play!

704
00:42:10,878 --> 00:42:13,823
- Down, boy. Sit. Roll over!
- Play!

705
00:42:14,023 --> 00:42:15,908
- Play dead!
- Play!

706
00:42:18,203 --> 00:42:20,663
Attaboy, Verne. Save the food.
I'll lose the dog.

707
00:42:20,863 --> 00:42:21,756
- Play.
- Huh?

708
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:23,357
Play, play, play, play.

709
00:42:23,557 --> 00:42:24,959
Play, play, play,
play.

710
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:32,433
Oh, no! No, no, no, no.

711
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:34,969
You're dropping
all the food, man!

712
00:42:35,169 --> 00:42:38,190
- Here, catch.
- Play!

713
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:40,266
Are you hungry?
Look, food.

714
00:42:42,768 --> 00:42:44,904
- Oh, my back!
- Whoa!

715
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:47,115
Look, people!
Play with them!

716
00:42:47,315 --> 00:42:49,784
- Look out!
- Stop! What's he doing?

717
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:52,824
- What was that?
- Play, play, play, play.

718
00:42:53,024 --> 00:42:55,865
I'm all right,
I'm fine. It's OK. It's...

719
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:01,787
Verne, unhook the chain.

720
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:07,252
Play!

721
00:43:09,546 --> 00:43:10,926
No.

722
00:43:11,126 --> 00:43:12,425
Yes.

723
00:43:12,625 --> 00:43:13,925
Bad.

724
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:18,471
- Oh, boy.
- Wow!

725
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:28,356
Verne, I told you
to unhook the chain.

726
00:43:45,081 --> 00:43:48,709
Garbage cans are not to be
on the curb before eight...

727
00:43:49,835 --> 00:43:52,088
Aah!

728
00:44:03,682 --> 00:44:05,560
You're the devil.

729
00:44:08,605 --> 00:44:12,275
Ow! Oh! Ow!

730
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:23,920
No! No!

731
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,504
Verne, you all right there?

732
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:27,648
- Gimme a hand, Oz.
- Sure, sure.

733
00:44:27,848 --> 00:44:29,792
- What happened?
- What happened?

734
00:44:29,992 --> 00:44:33,463
It's gone.
The food! Gone!

735
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:34,555
- What?
- Gone?

736
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:37,929
- How's it gone?
- Ask him!

737
00:44:38,129 --> 00:44:41,104
- Verne?
- I returned it

738
00:44:41,304 --> 00:44:43,606
- to its rightful owner.
- What?

739
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:46,192
We, like, worked
our tails off, you know?

740
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:49,687
Like, a lot. And the food
we gathered was totally...

741
00:44:49,887 --> 00:44:52,282
You know. And you're...
You're all, whatever.

742
00:44:52,482 --> 00:44:55,610
Yeah, Verne, what were you thinking?
The log was full!

743
00:44:55,810 --> 00:44:58,495
- Full of junk.
- So, what are you saying there?

744
00:44:58,695 --> 00:45:03,409
That the food we gather our way isn't
as good as the food we gather your way?

745
00:45:03,609 --> 00:45:05,502
Your way?
You mean his way.

746
00:45:05,702 --> 00:45:07,797
Can't you see RJ
is just using you?

747
00:45:07,997 --> 00:45:11,592
Verne! Shame on you.
RJ wouldn't do that.

748
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:14,587
You have got to trust me on this.
Don't you understand

749
00:45:14,787 --> 00:45:16,222
there's something
wrong with him?

750
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:19,100
My tail tingles
every time I get near him.

751
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:22,662
So we're supposed to go hungry
because your butt's vibrating?

752
00:45:22,862 --> 00:45:26,224
I'm starting to think that tingle
is just you being jealous.

753
00:45:26,424 --> 00:45:28,609
- Jealous? Of him?
- Yeah.

754
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:32,313
He's embracing the future there,
and you're just holding us back.

755
00:45:32,513 --> 00:45:34,899
I hold you back, all right.
From extinction.

756
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:36,326
See what you've done here?

757
00:45:36,526 --> 00:45:38,619
If they listened to half the
stuff you're telling them,

758
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:42,781
they'll be dead within a week.
You are only interested in taking advantage

759
00:45:42,981 --> 00:45:45,618
because they're too stupid
and naive to know any better.

760
00:45:49,788 --> 00:45:51,666
I'm not stupid.

761
00:45:54,335 --> 00:45:57,463
OK, I didn't mean...
Uh...

762
00:45:57,663 --> 00:45:59,424
I meant ignorant.

763
00:46:00,508 --> 00:46:04,645
To the ways over...
over there.

764
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:07,764
Come on, you guys.
You know I didn't mean it like that.

765
00:46:07,964 --> 00:46:09,559
Don't... don't do this.

766
00:46:09,759 --> 00:46:13,154
Stella? Ozzie?

767
00:46:13,354 --> 00:46:15,565
Hammy?
You know I didn't...

768
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:22,363
- Hammy...
- I'm not stupid.

769
00:46:22,563 --> 00:46:26,117
Please.

770
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:30,922
<i>I must</i>

771
00:46:31,122 --> 00:46:33,466
<i>Give the impression</i>

772
00:46:33,666 --> 00:46:36,652
<i>That I have the answers</i>

773
00:46:36,852 --> 00:46:39,476
<i>For everything</i>

774
00:46:39,676 --> 00:46:42,100
<i>You were</i>

775
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,601
<i>So disappointed</i>

776
00:46:44,801 --> 00:46:47,746
<i>To see me unravel</i>

777
00:46:47,946 --> 00:46:50,891
<i>So easily</i>

778
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:54,571
<i>It's only change</i>

779
00:46:54,771 --> 00:46:58,758
<i>It's only every</i>

780
00:46:58,958 --> 00:47:02,745
<i>Thing I know</i>

781
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:05,498
<i>It's only change</i>

782
00:47:05,698 --> 00:47:09,668
<i>And I'm only changing</i>

783
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:12,955
- Good night, Uncle RJ.
- Good night, kiddo.

784
00:47:13,155 --> 00:47:15,133
<i>La da, la da</i>

<i>La da da da da da
La da...</i>

786
00:47:19,504 --> 00:47:24,133
Moon's full, RJ.
See ya in the morning.

787
00:47:24,333 --> 00:47:26,102
<i>La da, la da</i>

00:47:26,302 --> 00:47:29,972
<i>La da da da da da</i>

<i>La da da da-da-da da</i>

00:47:35,594 --> 00:47:37,905
<i>You want</i>

792
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:40,074
<i>Something that's constant</i>

793
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:45,738
<i>And I only wanted
to be me</i>

794
00:47:45,938 --> 00:47:48,583
<i>But watch</i>

795
00:47:48,783 --> 00:47:53,078
<i>Even the stars above
Things that seem still...</i>

796
00:47:53,278 --> 00:47:55,914
This'll
cut you down to size!

797
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:59,636
<i>La da, la da</i>

798
00:47:59,836 --> 00:48:02,213
I got ya!

799
00:48:07,844 --> 00:48:10,229
- Is it done?
- Affirmative.

800
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:12,889
Did you put this one in?
This Depelter Turbo?

801
00:48:13,089 --> 00:48:14,651
That's a contraband item,
ma'am,

802
00:48:14,851 --> 00:48:18,321
as it is illegal
in every state, except Texas.

803
00:48:18,521 --> 00:48:21,215
I don't care if it's against
the Geneva Convention.

804
00:48:21,415 --> 00:48:23,909
I want it!
I thought you might.

805
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:27,112
So I took the liberty
of installing it for you.

806
00:48:28,823 --> 00:48:33,035
Adios, animal infestation.

807
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:36,088
Aah!

808
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:38,249
Oh, my.

809
00:48:43,755 --> 00:48:46,015
<i>La da, la da</i>

810
00:48:46,215 --> 00:48:48,976
<i>La da da da da da</i>

811
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:52,913
<i>La da, la da da da da da</i>

812
00:48:53,113 --> 00:48:56,851
What have I done?

813
00:48:58,561 --> 00:49:01,480
- Shouldn't have taken all that food.
- What?

814
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,199
I shouldn't have taken
all that food.

815
00:49:03,399 --> 00:49:06,611
I was just trying to return
things to the way they were.

816
00:49:06,811 --> 00:49:09,655
I was just being cautious.
'Cause that's what I am.

817
00:49:09,855 --> 00:49:11,374
I'm naturally tentative.

818
00:49:11,574 --> 00:49:14,122
There's even places
in my shell I haven't been.

819
00:49:14,322 --> 00:49:16,871
You, on the other hand,
you're like... cool.

820
00:49:17,071 --> 00:49:19,382
And crazy and fearless.

821
00:49:19,582 --> 00:49:23,294
I think they're right.
I think I'm just jealous.

822
00:49:23,494 --> 00:49:25,471
Verne, believe me,

823
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:28,474
you should not be
jealous of me.

824
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:32,177
You got a good thing here. You're trying
to do what's best for your family.

825
00:49:32,377 --> 00:49:35,347
And I think you're
what's best for them now.

826
00:49:35,547 --> 00:49:37,983
What about your tail?

827
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:42,897
My head says listen to my tail,
my tail says listen to my head, and I just...

828
00:49:43,097 --> 00:49:45,324
...end up
with an upset stomach.

829
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:47,493
That's why you need
to be in charge now.

830
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:50,496
- You don't know what's going on.
- And you do.

831
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:54,158
- So, what's the problem?
- This, Verne, is the problem.

832
00:49:54,358 --> 00:49:56,127
- You see this?
- I'm listening.

833
00:49:56,327 --> 00:49:58,170
- Just...

834
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:01,624
Just hang on a second.
All right?

835
00:50:01,824 --> 00:50:02,883
I, uh...

836
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:06,220
- You throwing the party?
- Yes. To the right.

837
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:09,507
There are protective booties
to put on over your shoes.

838
00:50:09,707 --> 00:50:11,976
Yes! Yes!

839
00:50:12,176 --> 00:50:15,830
- Uh, what is this?
- What?

840
00:50:16,030 --> 00:50:19,684
- Oh, that...
- Mm-hmm.

841
00:50:19,884 --> 00:50:20,901
...is a...

842
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:23,691
...list of all the stuff
that you lost, Verne.

843
00:50:23,891 --> 00:50:26,282
- Really?
- It's a big, long list. You can see.

844
00:50:26,482 --> 00:50:29,468
You're a... organized little guy, aren't you?
Nice job.

845
00:50:29,668 --> 00:50:32,655
You know what?
I know a place so chock-full of food,

846
00:50:32,855 --> 00:50:34,615
we could get it
all back in one night.

847
00:50:34,815 --> 00:50:36,867
Great. Let's go.
Where is it?

848
00:50:37,067 --> 00:50:39,119
- Inside that house.
- What?

849
00:50:41,539 --> 00:50:45,751
- What is the point of this thing?
- Just send it down.

850
00:50:45,951 --> 00:50:47,553
What Verne
is trying to say is...

851
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:51,215
I mean, it's hard to really sum
it all up in just one word.

852
00:50:51,415 --> 00:50:54,802
- But...
- I'm sorry.

853
00:50:55,002 --> 00:50:56,395
Oh, come here.

854
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:59,524
- Oh, come here, Verne.
- That's right.

855
00:50:59,724 --> 00:51:02,852
OK! Listen, stay in the huddle.
Here's the plan.

856
00:51:03,052 --> 00:51:07,773
Now, the traps are set
here, here, here,

857
00:51:07,973 --> 00:51:11,861
here, here, here,
here, here, here,

858
00:51:12,061 --> 00:51:17,304
here, here, here and here.

859
00:51:17,504 --> 00:51:21,631
Here, here, here, here.

860
00:51:21,831 --> 00:51:25,758
Big one here, here,

861
00:51:25,958 --> 00:51:28,882
- and maybe a few over here.
- Gee, is that all?

862
00:51:29,082 --> 00:51:32,006
No. There's a bunch
of red lights all over here.

863
00:51:32,206 --> 00:51:33,516
OK, Verne?
Looking a little green.

864
00:51:33,716 --> 00:51:36,519
I blacked out for a second there,
but I get the idea.

865
00:51:36,719 --> 00:51:39,764
There's lights, traps...
I might need to change my shell.

866
00:51:39,964 --> 00:51:42,441
OK, this is us.

867
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:44,402
- Can I be the car?
- I wanna be the car!

868
00:51:44,602 --> 00:51:48,022
- I'm the car. You be the shoe.
- The shoe is lame.

869
00:51:48,222 --> 00:51:50,858
Why don't you be
that snazzy-looking iron?

870
00:51:51,058 --> 00:51:52,159
Hey, it's not important!

871
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:55,371
Besides, I'm the car.
I'm always the car.

872
00:51:55,571 --> 00:51:59,120
The plan works in three simple steps.
Step one, kill the lights.

873
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:02,870
Step two, get inside.
Step three, get out with mountain of food.

874
00:52:03,070 --> 00:52:05,372
But this place
is like a fortress.

875
00:52:05,572 --> 00:52:07,675
Walls, so high.
Doors, impenetrable.

876
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:10,711
- How will we get in?
- The collar is the key.

877
00:52:12,088 --> 00:52:13,556
Literally, the collar.

878
00:52:13,756 --> 00:52:16,058
It's like a key that opens
the door and if...

879
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:19,720
And what? You think he's just
gonna hand over his collar to you?

880
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,931
Not to me,
my femme fatale. To you.

881
00:52:22,131 --> 00:52:23,148
- Her?
- Me?

882
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:25,166
You, Stella,
will get that cat

883
00:52:25,366 --> 00:52:27,677
to give you
his collar by using...

884
00:52:27,877 --> 00:52:30,188
- My stink.
- ...your feminine charms.

885
00:52:30,388 --> 00:52:32,825
Was that out loud?

886
00:52:33,025 --> 00:52:37,613
Look, raccoon, maybe that mask you're
wearing is obstructing your view,

887
00:52:37,813 --> 00:52:40,908
but if you haven't noticed,
I'm a skunk.

888
00:52:41,108 --> 00:52:42,167
On the outside, maybe.

889
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:44,912
But I'm looking inside,
Stella, and I see a fox.

890
00:52:45,112 --> 00:52:47,957
And all we gotta do
is get her out.

891
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:54,263
- Scissors.
- Scissors?

892
00:52:54,463 --> 00:52:56,048
- Here we go.
- Watch the...

893
00:52:56,248 --> 00:52:59,435
- Charcoal.
- Charcoal?

894
00:52:59,635 --> 00:53:01,516
- Air freshener.
- Tomato juice.

895
00:53:01,716 --> 00:53:03,597
- Cork.
- Cork? Don't you dare.

896
00:53:06,558 --> 00:53:09,394
- Get 'em!
- Score! Yeah!

897
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:14,984
- One more thing.
- Ow!

898
00:53:15,184 --> 00:53:16,577
Stop. That's it.

899
00:53:16,777 --> 00:53:20,405
Ladies and gentlemen,
our work here is done.

900
00:53:21,866 --> 00:53:23,083
Oh, my.

901
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:26,871
- Big jeepers.
- She's all like, wow.

902
00:53:27,071 --> 00:53:28,873
What?

903
00:53:30,791 --> 00:53:32,292
Oh.

904
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:39,600
Meow.

905
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,310
- Whoa!
- Amazing!

906
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:43,846
Gosh, she looks...

907
00:53:44,046 --> 00:53:45,848
Wow.

908
00:53:50,811 --> 00:53:54,815
All right, gang, this is it.
We're going in.

909
00:54:02,238 --> 00:54:06,869
Not again. Dang it!
Those things are so lifelike.

910
00:54:07,069 --> 00:54:10,414
Curse you, plastic moldsman.

911
00:54:28,057 --> 00:54:29,725
OK, Hammy.

912
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:34,146
Hammy!

913
00:54:46,617 --> 00:54:50,746
Go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go.

914
00:54:50,946 --> 00:54:53,925
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

915
00:54:54,125 --> 00:54:57,335
Hammy, I told you
that cookie's junk!

916
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:59,055
But I like a cookie.

917
00:54:59,255 --> 00:55:02,549
What's going on?
Is everything OK?

918
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:10,399
Ha ha! Here we go!

919
00:55:10,599 --> 00:55:15,687
Come on, Hammy, come on. Follow the
pretty light. There it is, that's it.

920
00:55:16,939 --> 00:55:18,882
That's it, that's it.

921
00:55:19,082 --> 00:55:21,026
There it is. Go get it.

922
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:28,659
Mm-hmm.
That's it, that's it.

923
00:55:30,828 --> 00:55:32,630
Go get it, you little nut!

924
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:36,425
- Bingo! OK, step two.

925
00:55:36,625 --> 00:55:39,503
I thought we'd be dead by step two,
so this is going great!

926
00:55:42,173 --> 00:55:44,466
OK, gorgeous,
you're on.

927
00:55:46,927 --> 00:55:50,388
Man, this better be
one stupid cat.

928
00:55:50,588 --> 00:55:53,225
Audio, go!

929
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:56,904
She's supposed to be a cat.

930
00:55:57,104 --> 00:56:00,398
Put it on cat.
Maybe the cat likes a cow.

931
00:56:00,598 --> 00:56:02,326
Who goes there?

932
00:56:02,526 --> 00:56:04,695
You're a cat!
You're a cat!

933
00:56:04,895 --> 00:56:06,162
You're a cat!

934
00:56:06,362 --> 00:56:08,991
Uh, I mean, I'm a cat.
Uh...

935
00:56:09,191 --> 00:56:11,502
- Meow.
- Yeah, right.

936
00:56:11,702 --> 00:56:13,587
Shoo. Go on,
get away from here.

937
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:16,565
My owner does not give
scraps to common strays.

938
00:56:16,765 --> 00:56:19,343
Common strays?
All right, you asked for it.

939
00:56:19,543 --> 00:56:22,796
- Get the collar!
- Gee, that's a nice collar you got on.

940
00:56:22,996 --> 00:56:25,349
- Mind if I have a look?
- No! Come no closer!

941
00:56:25,549 --> 00:56:28,844
I must not be so near a
creature of the outdoor woods.

942
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:33,540
- Away with your filth!
- My filth?

943
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:36,443
- My filth?!
- Oh, jeepers, here we go.

944
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:40,689
OK, that's it. I am sick and tired
of everybody taking one look at me

945
00:56:40,889 --> 00:56:43,067
and running away
'cause they think I'm filthy.

946
00:56:43,267 --> 00:56:44,994
Well, I got news for you.

947
00:56:45,194 --> 00:56:48,613
I didn't get all primped and preened to
have some over-fed, pompous puffball

948
00:56:48,813 --> 00:56:52,659
tell me he's too good for me.
I got makeup on my butt, dude!

949
00:56:52,859 --> 00:56:55,891
And you don't even
wanna know about the cork!

950
00:56:56,091 --> 00:56:59,124
Stop! No one has ever
spoken to me like that!

951
00:57:00,709 --> 00:57:04,171
It is bold. I like it.

952
00:57:07,465 --> 00:57:10,426
Well, believe me,
there's more where that came from...

953
00:57:10,626 --> 00:57:13,909
- ...puffball.
- All right, team, let's boogie.

954
00:57:14,109 --> 00:57:17,193
You are strong.
Your essence is overpowering.

955
00:57:17,393 --> 00:57:20,478
- What...? What do you mean by that?
- It is your eyes.

956
00:57:20,678 --> 00:57:24,482
- My eyes.
- They are luminous.

957
00:57:24,682 --> 00:57:27,203
Luminous? Dang.

958
00:57:27,403 --> 00:57:29,993
You know,
I think this is the part where I blacked out.

959
00:57:30,193 --> 00:57:32,783
Did the little shoes and cars
actually get into the house?

960
00:57:34,618 --> 00:57:37,171
- So you got a name?
- Yes.

961
00:57:37,371 --> 00:57:40,670
It is a Persian name,
for I am Persian.

962
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:43,969
I was born Prince
Tigeriess Mahmood Shabaz.

963
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:48,257
Ooh, that's a mouthful.
Can I just call you Tiger?

964
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:54,221
- This place is huge.
- Wicked cool.

965
00:57:54,421 --> 00:57:57,349
Animals are in the house.

966
00:58:05,983 --> 00:58:07,492
Wow!

967
00:58:07,692 --> 00:58:11,956
- Oh, my goodness.
- This is so cool.

968
00:58:12,156 --> 00:58:15,867
- Yes! OK, stations, everybody.
- Let's boogie!

969
00:58:16,067 --> 00:58:17,952
- We got it.
- Here we go.

970
00:58:18,152 --> 00:58:19,838
No grip, no grip, no grip.

971
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:24,668
- Hammy! Less claw, more pad.
- Oh, OK.

972
00:58:24,868 --> 00:58:26,295
That hurt.

973
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:33,102
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

974
00:58:33,302 --> 00:58:36,897
- Just a minute, I'll be right there.
- What was that?

975
00:58:37,097 --> 00:58:40,725
It... That's just the sound of my heart.
Can't you hear it?

976
00:58:43,145 --> 00:58:46,657
Aaah!

977
00:58:46,857 --> 00:58:49,276
This way, this way!

978
00:58:54,031 --> 00:58:57,909
OK, OK, we're good.
Go back to work.

979
00:58:58,109 --> 00:58:59,911
There ya go.

980
00:59:00,111 --> 00:59:01,913
Here, catch!

981
00:59:07,503 --> 00:59:09,972
Oh, boy.

982
00:59:10,172 --> 00:59:12,349
Yes, I'm gonna make it.

983
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:15,765
My father, he had
an exceptionally flat face.

984
00:59:15,965 --> 00:59:19,181
He was so beautiful,
he could barely breathe.

985
00:59:19,381 --> 00:59:20,732
Fascinating.

986
00:59:20,932 --> 00:59:24,561
...inside, I have a multi-leveled
climby-thing with shag carpet.

987
00:59:24,761 --> 00:59:26,500
- Come, I show you.
- No, no!

988
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:28,387
I haven't told you
about my life.

989
00:59:28,587 --> 00:59:30,275
Good, good.
Going great, going great.

990
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:33,912
What is that?

991
00:59:34,112 --> 00:59:37,491
That is what gets the humans
out of bed in the morning.

992
00:59:39,368 --> 00:59:40,919
Where'd she go?

993
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:42,538
Get down and stay down.

994
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:51,422
Move. Move.

995
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:12,776
Come on! We've gotta go
before she comes back.

996
01:00:14,361 --> 01:00:16,205
- No! Not without those Spuddies.
- What?

997
01:00:16,405 --> 01:00:20,409
Lou, Penny, back to the TV.
Heather, keep an eye on that human.

998
01:00:20,609 --> 01:00:22,744
- I'm on it, RJ.
- No, Heather. Wait!

999
01:00:22,944 --> 01:00:24,880
The tingle, the tingle.

1000
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:27,211
RJ! The wagon's full,
let's get out of here.

1001
01:00:27,411 --> 01:00:29,543
Hang on, Vincent,
this'll only take a second

1002
01:00:29,743 --> 01:00:30,802
- Vincent?
- Where?

1003
01:00:31,002 --> 01:00:33,347
- Who's Vincent?
- Oh, Verne, Vincent.

1004
01:00:33,547 --> 01:00:36,308
Simple slip of the bear.
Tongue! I... er...

1005
01:00:36,508 --> 01:00:40,804
Just bear with me is what
I meant to say.

1006
01:00:41,004 --> 01:00:43,307
There's no bear.

1007
01:00:46,184 --> 01:00:49,854
Lights fading.
Limbs growing co...

1008
01:00:51,607 --> 01:00:53,150
Heather.

1009
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:03,835
Oh, Heather!

1010
01:01:04,035 --> 01:01:07,205
There's a dead, white rat
on my staircase.

1011
01:01:11,126 --> 01:01:12,636
I thought you were dead.

1012
01:01:12,836 --> 01:01:14,838
I learned
from the best, Dad.

1013
01:01:15,038 --> 01:01:17,057
That's my girl.

1014
01:01:17,257 --> 01:01:19,184
Come to Papa.

1015
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:21,886
We better hurry.
We don't have much time.

1016
01:01:22,086 --> 01:01:23,563
- What's going on, RJ?
- Nothing!

1017
01:01:23,763 --> 01:01:26,016
Let's get out of here because
we have what we need.

1018
01:01:26,216 --> 01:01:28,372
- No, we don't.
- What are you talking about?

1019
01:01:28,572 --> 01:01:30,528
- We have more than enough.
- Hey, listen.

1020
01:01:30,728 --> 01:01:33,740
I've got this long to hand over that
wagon of food to a homicidal bear.

1021
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:38,153
If these Spuddies aren't on the menu,
then I will be. Now let go of my tail.

1022
01:01:38,353 --> 01:01:39,925
What?

1023
01:01:40,125 --> 01:01:41,698
Let go!

1024
01:01:45,243 --> 01:01:47,087
Hey, whoa!

1025
01:01:47,287 --> 01:01:48,797
Huh?

1026
01:01:48,997 --> 01:01:50,590
Uh, I'm sorry,
I've gotta go.

1027
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:56,421
Stella, Stella, where are you going?
Stella!

1028
01:01:57,964 --> 01:02:01,185
- Aaah!
- Stella!

1029
01:02:01,385 --> 01:02:06,390
Look, it's not you.
It won't work, OK, because I'm a...

1030
01:02:06,590 --> 01:02:07,899
Skunk!

1031
01:02:08,099 --> 01:02:11,269
Yeah, that. Sorry
you have to see this.

1032
01:02:11,469 --> 01:02:12,646
Fire in the hole!

1033
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:21,530
- Oh, my...
- This smell doesn't bother you?

1034
01:02:21,730 --> 01:02:24,741
No. This face
was bred for beauty.

1035
01:02:24,941 --> 01:02:26,618
I cannot smell a thing.

1036
01:02:26,818 --> 01:02:29,120
You can't smell?

1037
01:02:36,086 --> 01:02:39,839
To the door!
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

1038
01:02:40,039 --> 01:02:41,341
- Run!
- This way!

1039
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:47,898
Let's party.

1040
01:02:48,098 --> 01:02:50,667
- Bunnies!
- Aah!

1041
01:02:50,867 --> 01:02:53,237
Flee, my love.

1042
01:02:53,437 --> 01:02:55,489
Run, that way. Outside!

1043
01:02:55,689 --> 01:02:57,815
Move, kids! Come on!

1044
01:03:01,653 --> 01:03:05,073
Buenos días, reptile.

1045
01:03:10,161 --> 01:03:11,955
You've just been verminated.

1046
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:15,509
Whoa! You stink.

1047
01:03:15,709 --> 01:03:18,820
That's because you let them
into my... house!

1048
01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:21,932
- Those...
- Hey, Nancy, stop your honkin'.

1049
01:03:22,132 --> 01:03:25,719
These little guys will be
disposed of quickly and humanely.

1050
01:03:25,919 --> 01:03:29,556
No! Not humanely.
As inhumanely as possible.

1051
01:03:32,601 --> 01:03:35,646
It was a pleasure doing business with you,
ma'am.

1052
01:03:52,162 --> 01:03:57,292
- What's he gonna do to us, Mama?
- I don't know, baby.

1053
01:03:57,492 --> 01:04:00,137
I don't wanna die, Dad.
Not for real.

1054
01:04:00,337 --> 01:04:04,090
There, there, there,
sweetheart. We'll be OK.

1055
01:04:07,885 --> 01:04:10,475
You were right about him,
Verne.

1056
01:04:10,675 --> 01:04:13,266
We shoulda listened.
Sorry there.

1057
01:04:13,466 --> 01:04:16,694
No.

1058
01:04:16,894 --> 01:04:21,858
I knew we couldn't trust him,
and I got us into this.

1059
01:04:22,058 --> 01:04:24,986
I should've known better.

1060
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:32,998
Wow!

1061
01:04:33,198 --> 01:04:34,254
Vincent?

1062
01:04:34,454 --> 01:04:37,257
So I was on my way
down here to kill you.

1063
01:04:37,457 --> 01:04:41,252
But I stopped to watch the show,
and I gotta say...

1064
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:44,822
...that, right there,

1065
01:04:45,022 --> 01:04:46,924
is a thing of beauty.

1066
01:04:49,344 --> 01:04:52,814
That is the most vicious,
deceitful,

1067
01:04:53,014 --> 01:04:57,227
self-serving thing
I've ever seen.

1068
01:04:57,427 --> 01:04:58,987
Classic RJ.

1069
01:04:59,187 --> 01:05:03,358
You take the food,
and they take the fall.

1070
01:05:08,238 --> 01:05:11,867
You keep this up,
you're gonna end up just like me.

1071
01:05:12,067 --> 01:05:15,412
Having everything
you ever wanted.

1072
01:05:15,612 --> 01:05:17,881
But I already had that.

1073
01:05:18,081 --> 01:05:21,552
What, them?
Who are you kidding?

1074
01:05:21,752 --> 01:05:25,714
You said it yourself,
you're a family of one.

1075
01:05:25,914 --> 01:05:27,432
Always will be.

1076
01:05:27,632 --> 01:05:30,618
It's how guys like
you and me survive.

1077
01:05:30,818 --> 01:05:33,605
So a few saps
got hurt in the process.

1078
01:05:33,805 --> 01:05:39,811
Tough. That's life.
Trust me, you don't need them.

1079
01:05:40,011 --> 01:05:42,980
Actually, I do.

1080
01:05:44,733 --> 01:05:48,486
And right now,
they really need me.

1081
01:05:49,571 --> 01:05:51,615
So I really need this!

1082
01:05:51,815 --> 01:05:53,491
RJ!

1083
01:05:59,915 --> 01:06:01,750
What the...?

1084
01:06:08,757 --> 01:06:10,926
- There goes my back again.
- Are you OK?

1085
01:06:15,346 --> 01:06:17,065
You sorry sack of rat dung.

1086
01:06:17,265 --> 01:06:21,278
Whoa, Stella, this is a rescue.
I'm rescuing you.

1087
01:06:21,478 --> 01:06:24,481
I'm gonna gas you so hard
your grandchildren'll stink.

1088
01:06:24,681 --> 01:06:26,023
- Bear!
- What's that?

1089
01:06:26,223 --> 01:06:27,379
- Bear!
- Hair?

1090
01:06:27,579 --> 01:06:29,475
- Bear!
- Dare?

1091
01:06:29,675 --> 01:06:31,571
- Bear!
- Oh, bear!

1092
01:06:36,701 --> 01:06:38,912
What?

1093
01:06:41,498 --> 01:06:43,984
- We're out of control!
- We can drive.

1094
01:06:44,184 --> 01:06:46,670
- It's just like Auto-Homicide 3!
- What?

1095
01:06:51,132 --> 01:06:55,261
Verne, let me in!
Wrong button! Wrong button!

1096
01:06:55,461 --> 01:06:57,648
<i>Please select destination.</i>

1097
01:06:57,848 --> 01:07:00,567
Take us home!
Take us to the log!

1098
01:07:00,767 --> 01:07:03,979
<i>Previous destination selected.
Make a legal U-turn.</i>

1099
01:07:04,179 --> 01:07:06,022
We got it!

1100
01:07:09,275 --> 01:07:11,987
- Hammy! Let me in!
- Not listening to RJ.

1101
01:07:13,655 --> 01:07:15,223
Kids, lose that bear!

1102
01:07:15,423 --> 01:07:16,792
What weapons do we have?

1103
01:07:16,992 --> 01:07:19,828
- We've got a hammer.
- Cool.

1104
01:07:21,162 --> 01:07:23,540
You little...

1105
01:07:25,166 --> 01:07:26,760
Thank you. Yes, yes! Hey!

1106
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:30,213
- Let me in, let me in!
- No! Ring-tailed charlatan!

1107
01:07:30,413 --> 01:07:31,389
Ozzie!

1108
01:07:31,589 --> 01:07:33,433
He's trying to help us.
Just let him in.

1109
01:07:33,633 --> 01:07:37,261
- After what he did to us?
- But he came back.

1110
01:07:37,461 --> 01:07:38,889
And he brought a bear.

1111
01:07:41,349 --> 01:07:43,835
Hey! No fighting
while we're driving.

1112
01:07:44,035 --> 01:07:46,521
We will turn this van
around, mister.

1113
01:07:46,721 --> 01:07:48,865
He started it.

1114
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:50,908
I'm telling you,
he's trying to help us.

1115
01:07:51,108 --> 01:07:54,821
But, Verne, you're the one who
always says trust your tail.

1116
01:07:55,021 --> 01:07:57,499
- But it's not tingling.
- Oh!

1117
01:07:57,699 --> 01:08:01,745
- Why didn't you say so?
- Hey!

1118
01:08:01,945 --> 01:08:03,120
Thank you, thank you.

1119
01:08:05,248 --> 01:08:07,509
- You're dead, RJ!
- Duck!

1120
01:08:07,709 --> 01:08:10,253
- And your friends are next.
- Look out!

1121
01:08:11,796 --> 01:08:13,965
<i>Make an immediate left turn.</i>

1122
01:08:14,165 --> 01:08:15,759
Whoa!

1123
01:08:17,594 --> 01:08:19,229
Bonus points!

1124
01:08:19,429 --> 01:08:21,389
Huh?

1125
01:08:28,646 --> 01:08:30,569
Yeah!

1126
01:08:30,769 --> 01:08:33,111
Ohh!

1127
01:08:33,311 --> 01:08:35,453
RJ!

1128
01:08:35,653 --> 01:08:36,705
- Yeah!
- Oh!

1129
01:08:36,905 --> 01:08:39,265
- Look out.
- High score.

1130
01:08:39,465 --> 01:08:41,826
No, no, no, no!

1131
01:09:01,429 --> 01:09:03,974
<i>You have arrived.</i>

1132
01:09:07,226 --> 01:09:09,395
Everybody all right?

1133
01:09:11,314 --> 01:09:13,900
- Come on!
- We've gotta go, we've gotta go!

1134
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:16,327
The old
jazz dance injury.

1135
01:09:16,527 --> 01:09:19,739
- Come on, come on. Quillo!
- Go, go, go.

1136
01:09:24,535 --> 01:09:26,412
- Did we make it?
- That was close!

1137
01:09:26,612 --> 01:09:28,456
- All right!
- Are we here?

1138
01:09:28,656 --> 01:09:30,500
Penny? The kids here?
Hammy?

1139
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:32,961
Scary clown.

1140
01:09:39,216 --> 01:09:42,219
Look out!

1141
01:09:47,475 --> 01:09:51,646
A weed hacker, Verne.
A weed hacker!

1142
01:09:51,846 --> 01:09:54,324
- Hey!
- Up, up, go up.

1143
01:09:54,524 --> 01:09:58,569
Show your little rat faces.
Filthy creatures.

1144
01:09:58,769 --> 01:10:00,989
Stay in the woods
where you belong.

1145
01:10:01,189 --> 01:10:03,491
Watch out!

1146
01:10:07,578 --> 01:10:12,125
You guys wanna party, do ya?
All right, then, let's party.

1147
01:10:14,085 --> 01:10:15,679
- Mom!
- Kids!

1148
01:10:15,879 --> 01:10:20,600
Penny, Lou,
look out! Down!

1149
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:24,245
That's it! Verne, get everybody out of here.
I'll distract him.

1150
01:10:24,445 --> 01:10:27,891
- Are you crazy? He'll kill you.
- Well, I'm the one he wants.

1151
01:10:28,091 --> 01:10:29,872
Take care of your family,
Verne.

1152
01:10:30,072 --> 01:10:31,653
I intend to.
The whole family.

1153
01:10:31,853 --> 01:10:35,190
- There's got to be something we can do.
- There's no time.

1154
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:39,194
Hammy!

1155
01:10:41,946 --> 01:10:45,000
Ahh.

1156
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:47,251
Hey, Vincent.
You were right.

1157
01:10:47,451 --> 01:10:51,039
With a Spuddie,
enough just isn't enough.

1158
01:10:51,239 --> 01:10:54,133
RJ!

1159
01:10:54,333 --> 01:10:56,669
Now, Hammy. Go, go, go!

1160
01:10:56,869 --> 01:10:59,255
OK...

1161
01:11:35,208 --> 01:11:39,003
I got the cookie.

1162
01:12:10,910 --> 01:12:12,829
- Huh?
- Ohh.

1163
01:12:19,127 --> 01:12:23,131
- That's the...
- The Depelter Turbo.

1164
01:12:23,331 --> 01:12:26,517
Prepare for a lot
of stinging.

1165
01:12:26,717 --> 01:12:29,846
Oh, no!
No, no! No, no! No!

1166
01:12:42,483 --> 01:12:44,661
- Ouch!
- My hair!

1167
01:12:44,861 --> 01:12:47,363
That stung
like I knew it would!

1168
01:12:57,373 --> 01:13:01,344
- Yeah!
- All right!

1169
01:13:01,544 --> 01:13:04,263
Good job, everybody.
That's teamwork.

1170
01:13:04,463 --> 01:13:06,841
Come here, Hammy, come here.
You are a genius, my boy.

1171
01:13:07,041 --> 01:13:10,520
Oh, thank...
you.

1172
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:13,514
And, Verne, don't you
ever fix this shell!

1173
01:13:13,714 --> 01:13:16,017
Yeah.
Glad it's working for ya.

1174
01:13:16,217 --> 01:13:17,652
Take it off, give it back.

1175
01:13:17,852 --> 01:13:20,901
Here we go, off to
the Rockies for you, Smoky.

1176
01:13:21,101 --> 01:13:24,150
Now, you do realize
that was a Depelter Turbo?

1177
01:13:24,350 --> 01:13:25,952
Officer, please.
It was that Verminator.

1178
01:13:26,152 --> 01:13:29,239
He sold it to me.
This has nothing to do with me.

1179
01:13:29,439 --> 01:13:30,623
Hey, hey,
it was in your yard.

1180
01:13:30,823 --> 01:13:33,246
Your name's on the contract,
so tell it to the judge.

1181
01:13:33,446 --> 01:13:35,670
- No! It's not my fault! Let go of me!
- Ma'am...

1182
01:13:35,870 --> 01:13:39,874
I can't be arrested! I'm the president
of the homeowner's association!

1183
01:13:40,074 --> 01:13:41,217
Take her down!

1184
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:43,344
She's getting away!

1185
01:13:43,544 --> 01:13:48,591
- We got a twitcher! Watch it! Ma'am!
- Get her!

1186
01:13:48,791 --> 01:13:50,551
- Stop that!
- Can I get help over here?

1187
01:13:50,751 --> 01:13:52,094
Somebody get a hold
of her legs!

1188
01:13:52,294 --> 01:13:53,437
- Play?
- Oh, no!

1189
01:13:53,637 --> 01:13:56,102
No, no! No, no! Aah!

1190
01:13:56,302 --> 01:13:58,436
High five, Hammy!

1191
01:13:58,636 --> 01:14:00,770
- Yes!
- It worked!

1192
01:14:00,970 --> 01:14:02,572
We did it!

1193
01:14:02,772 --> 01:14:05,616
- Oh, yes!
- Stella!

1194
01:14:05,816 --> 01:14:07,693
- Stella!
- Over here, Tiger.

1195
01:14:07,893 --> 01:14:09,279
Oh, Stella.

1196
01:14:10,696 --> 01:14:15,543
So this is the outdoor
woods? I like it.

1197
01:14:15,743 --> 01:14:18,813
Come on, big boy.
You're coming with me.

1198
01:14:19,013 --> 01:14:21,883
You know, RJ, um,
just for the record,

1199
01:14:22,083 --> 01:14:25,153
if you had told us that all that
food you were trying to get

1200
01:14:25,353 --> 01:14:28,423
was to pay back an angry bear,
we would've given it to you.

1201
01:14:28,623 --> 01:14:31,926
- Really?
- Yeah, that's what families do.

1202
01:14:32,126 --> 01:14:33,728
They look out
for each other.

1203
01:14:33,928 --> 01:14:36,789
I've never had
anything like that.

1204
01:14:36,989 --> 01:14:39,650
I know.
But believe me, this...

1205
01:14:39,850 --> 01:14:42,169
This is the gateway
to the good life.

1206
01:14:42,369 --> 01:14:44,488
Wish you would've
told me that sooner.

1207
01:14:44,688 --> 01:14:48,318
Well, that's bad communication.
Also something families do.

1208
01:14:48,518 --> 01:14:51,195
So, what do you say?
You wanna be a part of it?

1209
01:14:56,451 --> 01:15:01,956
Come here, come here.
I promised I wouldn't do this. OK.

1210
01:15:02,156 --> 01:15:03,791
Welcome to the family!

1211
01:15:03,991 --> 01:15:05,626
- Hey!
- Group hug!

1212
01:15:05,826 --> 01:15:07,303
OK, OK.

1213
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:09,931
What a first week of spring.

1214
01:15:10,131 --> 01:15:13,759
Wait a minute! That means there's
only 267 days left till winter.

1215
01:15:13,959 --> 01:15:15,532
What are we gonna do
for food?

1216
01:15:15,732 --> 01:15:17,305
Oh! Oh, oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh!

1217
01:15:17,505 --> 01:15:19,398
Yes, Hammy.

1218
01:15:19,598 --> 01:15:21,192
I filled the log.

1219
01:15:21,392 --> 01:15:24,070
- Jeepers!
- What...?

1220
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:27,273
Look, look!
I found my nuts! Oof!

1221
01:15:32,903 --> 01:15:34,914
<i>We're rockin' the suburbs</i>

1222
01:15:35,114 --> 01:15:37,642
<i>From Family Feud
to Chevy Chase</i>

1223
01:15:37,842 --> 01:15:40,170
<i>We're rockin' the suburbs</i>

1224
01:15:40,370 --> 01:15:42,772
<i>We numb the muscles
in our face</i>

1225
01:15:42,972 --> 01:15:45,175
<i>We're rockin' the suburbs</i>

1226
01:15:45,375 --> 01:15:47,760
<i>We feed the dog
and mow the lawn</i>

1227
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:50,180
<i>Watching Mommy
balance the checks</i>

1228
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:54,027
<i>While Daddy juggles credit cards</i>

1229
01:16:04,227 --> 01:16:06,321
<i>Let me tell y'all
what it's like</i>

1230
01:16:06,521 --> 01:16:09,115
<i>Watching idol
on a Friday night</i>

1231
01:16:09,315 --> 01:16:11,534
<i>In a house
built safe and sound</i>

1232
01:16:11,734 --> 01:16:15,821
<i>On Indian burial ground
Shamon</i>

1233
01:16:19,616 --> 01:16:21,627
<i>We drive our cars everyday</i>

1234
01:16:21,827 --> 01:16:24,297
<i>To and from work
both ways</i>

1235
01:16:24,497 --> 01:16:26,716
<i>So we make
just enough to pay</i>

1236
01:16:26,916 --> 01:16:30,711
<i>To drive our cars to work

1243

<i>They got
better looking fescue</i>

1244
01:16:51,999 --> 01:16:55,027

<i>Mom left the TV dinner on</i>

<i>We feed the dog

1257
01:17:39,572 --> 01:17:41,540
<i>Watching Mommy
balance the checks</i>

1258
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:46,421
<i>While Daddy
juggles credit cards</i>

1259
01:17:46,621 --> 01:17:51,417
That, my friends, is the object of
all human attention and devotion.

1260
01:17:51,617 --> 01:17:53,803
- And they call it a TV.
- Wicked cool!

1261
01:17:54,003 --> 01:17:57,340
Humans feel an inner need to
connect with the world around them.

1262
01:17:57,540 --> 01:17:58,641
That is super-duper.

1263
01:17:58,841 --> 01:18:00,868
They also feel a need
to sit on their fat butts.

1264
01:18:01,068 --> 01:18:03,095
Watching TV fulfills
both needs at the same time.

1265
01:18:03,295 --> 01:18:04,814
Wow. Interesting.

1266
01:18:05,014 --> 01:18:07,766
Come on, kids.
Family time there, in front of the TV.

1267
01:18:07,966 --> 01:18:08,734
Got your snack food?

1268
01:18:08,934 --> 01:18:10,669
Buy a vowel.
Buy a vowel!

1269
01:18:10,869 --> 01:18:12,405
Buy a "Y". Please buy a "Y".

1270
01:18:12,605 --> 01:18:14,949
I can't find the remote.
- Hey, Spikey, race ya!

1271
01:18:15,149 --> 01:18:17,734
- Has anybody seen the remote?
- Dad, chill.

1272
01:18:17,934 --> 01:18:19,120
I could do a little TV.

1273
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:21,947
Today's the day we find out
if the baby is gifted

1274
01:18:22,147 --> 01:18:23,574
or if Saxon is really an alien.

1275
01:18:23,774 --> 01:18:25,001
Like Khan
in Star Trek II!

1276
01:18:25,201 --> 01:18:27,370
The Genesis Project was in
the hands of the Enterprise,

1277
01:18:27,570 --> 01:18:29,830
but Khan had his plan
to steal the invention!

1278
01:18:30,030 --> 01:18:31,174
Well,
that was specific.

1279
01:18:31,374 --> 01:18:33,217
I saw it on TNT,
a retrospective.

1280
01:18:33,417 --> 01:18:35,878
- Gummi Worm, anybody?
- Let me have one.

1281
01:18:36,078 --> 01:18:37,513
Bucky,
pass this to Lou.

1282
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:39,807
- Taste this.
- Don't you take that.

1283
01:18:40,007 --> 01:18:42,426
- This is the perfect food.
- Fat-free cookies?

1284
01:18:42,626 --> 01:18:44,061
Might as well be eating dirt.

1285
01:18:44,261 --> 01:18:47,056
I've had dirt. I don't like dirt.
It tastes like dirt.

1286
01:18:47,256 --> 01:18:49,692
The show is starting.
