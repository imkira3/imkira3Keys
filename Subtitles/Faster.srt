A week after
the last Grand Prix of the year, in early November,

00:00:31,514 --> 00:00:34,344
the teams are out testing
for next season.

00:00:34,379 --> 00:00:35,897

a little extra speed.

00:00:43,422 --> 00:00:44,872
They're crazy.

00:00:44,906 --> 00:00:46,770
They're gonna
kill themselves.

12
00:00:47,254 --> 00:00:48,945
Maybe.

13
00:00:48,979 --> 00:00:50,947
But what about the buzz?

14
00:00:50,981 --> 00:00:52,259
The babes?

15
00:00:52,293 --> 00:00:54,433
The money?

16
00:00:54,468 --> 00:00:58,748
In fact, since 1960, only one
of the 500cc World Champions

He was testing
a Formula 1 car at the time.

But they all survived their
motorcycle racing careers.

I used to think
all road racers were nuts.

00:01:45,795 --> 00:01:48,246
You know, racing around a track
at that speed.

34
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,696
Well, it's just
like a video game

the element of danger.

36
00:01:54,631 --> 00:01:57,634
As a racer, you always
have that in the back
of your mind...

37
00:01:57,669 --> 00:01:58,946
You always wonder,

"When's it gonna happen?"

'Cause it will happen.

00:08:18,567 --> 00:08:20,292
he wanted him
to ride a bike, too.

177
00:08:20,327 --> 00:08:23,503
CHECA:
My father was not so bad.
My mother, for sure, no.

178
00:08:23,537 --> 00:08:27,507
And then my grandfather,
he had some money.

179
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:29,370
But he give me
nothing for race. [LAUGHS]

180
00:08:29,405 --> 00:08:32,857
He told me, "For study,
I give you what you want.

181
00:08:32,891 --> 00:08:35,307
"But just for bikes, I don't
want to give you nothing."

182
00:08:35,342 --> 00:08:36,688
LORIS CAPIROSSI:
My mother is my manager,

183
00:08:36,723 --> 00:08:38,241
but never see the race.

184
00:08:38,276 --> 00:08:41,279
When the race is finished,
I phone home and say,

185
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:43,419
"Okay, Mom.
I finish third, four, five."

186
00:08:43,453 --> 00:08:44,869
"Okay, I see the race."

187
00:08:44,903 --> 00:08:47,561
All the time, my mother say,
"Okay, Loris, go easy.

188
00:08:47,596 --> 00:08:49,356
"Go easy. Go slowly."

189
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:51,910
But for my job,
it's difficult to go slowly.

190
00:08:51,945 --> 00:08:53,878
It's better to go more fast
all the time.

191
00:08:53,912 --> 00:08:56,018
I am here because

192
00:08:56,052 --> 00:08:59,677
I have a son racing
in the motorcycle... [LAUGHS]

193
00:08:59,711 --> 00:09:03,819
In the Motorcycle GP
that is named Valentino Rossi.

194
00:09:03,853 --> 00:09:07,098
And I am a big fan of motorcycle

195
00:09:07,132 --> 00:09:10,066
and a big fan of Valentino.

196
00:09:10,101 --> 00:09:13,035
My mother
was not very happy,

197
00:09:13,069 --> 00:09:17,487
because she want I study
and blah, blah, blah.

198
00:09:17,522 --> 00:09:19,213
But now,
come to see the races,

199
00:09:19,248 --> 00:09:22,631
and yes, have a little bit
of fear like all the mothers.

200
00:09:22,665 --> 00:09:26,220
My mother, too,
she say motorcycle is crazy.

201
00:09:26,255 --> 00:09:27,912
VALENTINO:
My father race also.

202
00:09:27,946 --> 00:09:29,879
So when I started,
she say no.

203
00:09:29,914 --> 00:09:33,020
After Graziano,
also my son.

204
00:09:33,055 --> 00:09:35,471
But in the end,
it's like this.

205
00:09:35,505 --> 00:09:40,027
The motorcycle is
a little bit hard sport.

206
00:09:40,062 --> 00:09:42,720
To be...
pay very good attention.

207
00:09:42,754 --> 00:09:45,550
A lot of fun
when you get it right,

208
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:49,105
but the other side
of the coin
isn't that great.

209
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:52,005
I touched a white line.
It was very, very greasy.

210
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:53,558
It was almost like ice.

211
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:57,217
On full acceleration,
probably about
135 mile an hour,

212
00:09:57,251 --> 00:09:58,563
the bike just threw me off.

213
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,807
Went straight into a sand trap and then into a wall.

214
00:10:00,841 --> 00:10:03,223
I broke my leg
into around 17 pieces,

215
00:10:03,257 --> 00:10:05,328
and my foot,
my hand, my arm,

216
00:10:05,363 --> 00:10:07,227
my shoulders, ribs.

217
00:10:07,261 --> 00:10:09,229
Just a couple
little odds and ends.

218
00:10:09,263 --> 00:10:12,473
It's madness.
I can't think of it
any other way.

219
00:10:12,508 --> 00:10:16,374
To enjoy riding
a motorcycle fast,

220
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:17,962
to develop your skills

221
00:10:17,996 --> 00:10:21,655
and to exploit them
in competition is one thing.

222
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:24,727
But then to do it
at this level,

223
00:10:24,762 --> 00:10:27,109
this absolutely
fearsome pitch,

224
00:10:27,143 --> 00:10:29,214
weekend after weekend,

225
00:10:29,249 --> 00:10:31,872
against other people
who are quite as mad

226
00:10:31,907 --> 00:10:33,494
and quite as good as you,

227
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:35,842
that's what
I find fascinating,

228
00:10:35,876 --> 00:10:39,742
and frightening
and admirable about racing.

229
00:10:39,777 --> 00:10:41,710
RYDER: The thing about
motorcycle racing

230
00:10:41,744 --> 00:10:43,470
is you can see a man
at work.

231
00:10:43,504 --> 00:10:45,472
If a guy nearly goes
over the handlebars

232
00:10:45,506 --> 00:10:47,163
at 120 miles an hour,

233
00:10:47,198 --> 00:10:49,752
his body language tells you
what just happened.

234
00:10:49,787 --> 00:10:52,721
You can absolutely tell
what's going on

235
00:10:52,755 --> 00:10:54,895
just from the shapes
these guys make.

236
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:58,278
DOOHAN: At 100 and,
say, 60 miles an hour

237
00:10:58,312 --> 00:11:00,418
or 260 kilometers an hour,

238
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:02,627
the bike really doesn't want
to change directions.

239
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:03,904
It just wants
to keep going straight.

240
00:11:03,939 --> 00:11:06,355
You don't just
turn the handlebars.

241
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:08,012
You've actually got to
physically steer it

242
00:11:08,046 --> 00:11:09,254
with your feet
and your body

243
00:11:09,289 --> 00:11:11,222
to actually make it
change directions.

244
00:11:11,256 --> 00:11:14,294
If you
just turn the handlebar,
the tire will turn,

245
00:11:14,328 --> 00:11:16,676
but the bike will keep,
actually, straight ahead.

246
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,367
Doing the car racing
that I've done,

247
00:11:18,401 --> 00:11:19,886
I always felt like,

248
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,957
"If I could just move around
in this seat a little bit,

249
00:11:21,991 --> 00:11:24,097
"maybe I could change
the handling of the car."

250
00:11:24,131 --> 00:11:26,306
But, you know,
it's a 3,000-pound car,

251
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,273
and you're not
going to affect
the handling of it very much.

252
00:11:28,308 --> 00:11:30,310
Whereas,
a Grand Prix motorcycle,

253
00:11:30,344 --> 00:11:33,727
sliding your butt back
two inches in the seat,

254
00:11:33,762 --> 00:11:35,522
you know,
affects the nose weight

255
00:11:35,556 --> 00:11:38,456
to the rear end weight
a ton on a motorcycle.

256
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:43,116
Motorcycle racing,
the rider is probably
80% of the equation,

257
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:46,153
whereas in,
say, Formula 1, in cars,

258
00:11:46,188 --> 00:11:48,708
I would say that
the car is 80%
of the equation,

259
00:11:48,742 --> 00:11:50,157
and the driver is 20.

260
00:11:50,192 --> 00:11:51,849
The biggest difference
comes from the rider.

261
00:11:51,883 --> 00:11:53,920
If they're in a good mood

262
00:11:53,954 --> 00:11:56,163
and happy with the set-up
of the bike,

263
00:11:56,198 --> 00:11:59,028
they make a great difference
to the actual lap time,

264
00:11:59,063 --> 00:12:01,134
compared to what we can do
with adjustments.

265
00:12:01,168 --> 00:12:04,896
I think 90% of motorcycle
racing is between the ears.

266
00:12:07,243 --> 00:12:10,143
GRAZIANO:
I remember Valentino begin

267
00:12:10,177 --> 00:12:13,284
to test motorcycle
before the bike.

268
00:12:13,318 --> 00:12:17,875
I think he was two years old
or two and a half probably.

269
00:12:17,909 --> 00:12:21,810
I was not able
to teach nothing.

270
00:12:21,844 --> 00:12:24,226
No, no, no, no time.

271
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:28,540
I was only able
to get Valentino with me

272
00:12:28,575 --> 00:12:30,163
to know the riders,

273
00:12:30,197 --> 00:12:33,891
and to know the bikes
and to know the sport, yeah.

274
00:12:33,925 --> 00:12:38,585
When I tried to
teach him something,

275
00:12:38,619 --> 00:12:42,485
he looked me
in a strange way.

276
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,454
And I understand
that he want to do

277
00:12:45,488 --> 00:12:47,939
all alone, every time.

278
00:12:47,974 --> 00:12:49,769
I started working
with Valentino

279
00:12:49,803 --> 00:12:53,945
at the beginning of 2000
or the end of 1999,

280
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:56,637
after it was clear
that Mick Doohan was not

281
00:12:56,672 --> 00:12:58,778
going to resume his career
after the accident.

282
00:12:58,812 --> 00:13:01,470
Valentino had already won
the 250 World Championship

283
00:13:01,504 --> 00:13:03,575
and was keen to step up.

284
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:05,267
The moment I started
to work with him,

285
00:13:05,301 --> 00:13:07,441
it was very clear
that he had

286
00:13:07,476 --> 00:13:10,341
extremely good education
in his younger years.

287
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:12,964
The Doctor because...
[CHUCKLES]

288
00:13:12,999 --> 00:13:15,104
I don't think
there is a particular reason.

289
00:13:15,139 --> 00:13:19,868
But is beautiful and is
important, The Doctor.
[LAUGHS]

290
00:13:19,902 --> 00:13:23,906
And in Italy,
The Doctor is a name

291
00:13:23,941 --> 00:13:27,289
you give to someone
for respect.

292
00:13:27,323 --> 00:13:30,016
It's very important.
The Doctor is important.

293
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:31,086
[CHUCKLES]

294
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,709
SHEENE:
Biaggi is a good rider.

295
00:13:33,743 --> 00:13:36,332
You know, on his day,
he's really good.

296
00:13:36,367 --> 00:13:37,851
It's just a matter
of finding his day.

297
00:13:37,886 --> 00:13:40,543
I could be wrong,
but I just don't think

298
00:13:40,578 --> 00:13:42,856
he has what Rossi has.

299
00:13:42,891 --> 00:13:45,963
He's quick, but he's not
quick everywhere.

300
00:13:45,997 --> 00:13:48,344
And when the bike
has a problem,

301
00:13:48,379 --> 00:13:50,691
a lot of the times,
he can't ride around that.

302
00:13:50,726 --> 00:13:53,073
In the smaller categories,
he was brilliant.

303
00:13:53,108 --> 00:13:54,695
SCOTT: He's a very,
very complex character.

304
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:56,663
He's a very interesting man.

305
00:13:56,697 --> 00:14:00,667
Max Biaggi's mother
abandoned the family

306
00:14:00,701 --> 00:14:03,118
when he was,
I'm not quite sure how old.

307
00:14:03,152 --> 00:14:05,154
It just isn't something
anyone talks about very much.

308
00:14:05,189 --> 00:14:07,467
But she abandoned him
as an infant.

309
00:14:07,501 --> 00:14:10,539
I would think
you could take it as a read

310
00:14:10,573 --> 00:14:13,162
that that's going to have
a very severe effect
on your psyche.

311
00:14:13,197 --> 00:14:17,304
It's driven Max to be an extraordinary perfectionist.

312
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:18,961
He's terribly punishing
on himself

313
00:14:18,996 --> 00:14:21,308
when he's less than perfect.

314
00:14:21,343 --> 00:14:26,106
It's also left him
with a distorted sense
of proportion.

315
00:14:26,141 --> 00:14:28,453
I think he's
definitely a product

316
00:14:28,488 --> 00:14:30,870
of the press PR machine

317
00:14:30,904 --> 00:14:33,217
that his team
and sponsors generate,

318
00:14:33,251 --> 00:14:35,564
and perhaps
he's believed it a bit.

319
00:14:35,598 --> 00:14:36,876
BURGESS:
It's common knowledge

320
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:40,500
that Max and Valentino are

321
00:14:40,534 --> 00:14:43,227
completely different
types of people.

322
00:14:43,261 --> 00:14:45,332
Regardless of what sport
they're involved in,

323
00:14:45,367 --> 00:14:50,061
they're probably never going
to ever be friends.

324
00:14:50,096 --> 00:14:51,960
As far as Rossi's concerned,

325
00:14:51,994 --> 00:14:54,100
it's been going on
for a long time,

326
00:14:54,134 --> 00:14:56,205
since, I think, even before
he started racing.

327
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,035
He was a Capirossi fan.

328
00:14:58,069 --> 00:15:00,071
And Capirossi and Biaggi
were racing,

329
00:15:00,106 --> 00:15:04,110
so he just naturally,
as a fan,

330
00:15:04,144 --> 00:15:07,285
didn't like his hero's rival.

331
00:15:08,528 --> 00:15:11,048
Then there's
a personal animosity,

332
00:15:11,082 --> 00:15:14,465
and there's a great personality difference between them.

333
00:15:14,499 --> 00:15:17,330
And that's just grown
and grown and grown.

334
00:15:17,364 --> 00:15:19,573
And Biaggi made
an interesting remark.

335
00:15:19,608 --> 00:15:23,025
He said that,
"Rossi's been racing against me

336
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:26,442
"even when he was on a 125
and I was on a 500.

337
00:15:26,477 --> 00:15:28,341
"And I've only been racing
against Rossi

338
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:30,101
"since he came
into the same class."

339
00:15:30,136 --> 00:15:32,276
They've got all sorts
of different reasons to...
[CHUCKLES]

340
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:35,003
Biaggi is Roman.
Up market.

341
00:15:35,037 --> 00:15:37,867
Likes the film stars
and football stars.

342
00:15:37,902 --> 00:15:41,285
Lives in Monaco
where you're supposed to
if you're, you know...

343
00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:43,701
And Rossi, seaside boy.

344
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:46,876
Grew up as what the Americans,
I believe, call a paddock brat.

345
00:15:46,911 --> 00:15:48,361
Biaggi certainly didn't.

346
00:15:48,395 --> 00:15:49,914
SCOTT:
I think it's really Biaggi

347
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,467
who drives the rivalry,

348
00:15:51,502 --> 00:15:53,953
and Rossi plays with it.
Rossi exploits it.

349
00:15:55,264 --> 00:15:57,887
Rossi's quite clever
in that way.

350
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,857
RYDER: I thought Max
was out of order.

351
00:16:01,891 --> 00:16:04,618
I thought he was
well out of order.

352
00:16:04,653 --> 00:16:07,000
Okay. Rossi was going
around the outside,

353
00:16:07,035 --> 00:16:08,553
which was a big ask.

354
00:16:08,588 --> 00:16:10,970
And Max was probably
quite legitimately
drifting out.

355
00:16:11,004 --> 00:16:13,006
And he may have thought...
I don't know what he thought,

356
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:15,284
but he shouldn't have done it,
in my view.

357
00:16:15,319 --> 00:16:17,942
SCHWANTZ:
It looks like he's trying

358
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,462
to elbow Rossi
off the track,

359
00:16:20,496 --> 00:16:23,016
and that's probably
what Rossi translates it as.

360
00:16:23,051 --> 00:16:26,986
When you stack two motorcycles
side by side

361
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:30,265
on the same foot and a half
or two foot of pavement

362
00:16:30,299 --> 00:16:32,094
that they're trying
to race on,

363
00:16:32,129 --> 00:16:33,785
a lot of times you do stuff
with your body

364
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:37,686
to keep parts
of the motorcycle
from actually hitting,

365
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,102
so that you don't get
a handlebar locked

366
00:16:40,137 --> 00:16:42,035
with somebody else
and fall over.

367
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:45,038
So, in Biaggi's defense,
I can see him

368
00:16:45,073 --> 00:16:46,936
maybe trying to get off
the bike a little bit

369
00:16:46,971 --> 00:16:50,354
and looking like he's actually
trying to elbow Rossi

370
00:16:50,388 --> 00:16:53,081
more than he was actually
trying to do.

371
00:16:53,115 --> 00:16:56,360
Maybe Valentino was taking
more of a risk

372
00:16:56,394 --> 00:16:57,982
than he really needed to.

373
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,535
Again,
trying to make a point.

374
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:02,159
"Well, it's Max.
I'm going to go
around the long way."

375
00:17:02,193 --> 00:17:04,782
Um, Max wasn't having it,
was he?

376
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:06,163
No, it wasn't pretty.

377
00:17:06,197 --> 00:17:08,061
To have actually been there,
and seen it,

378
00:17:08,096 --> 00:17:09,925
and know what
the frame of mind was

379
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:12,893
between those two guys
at that given time,

380
00:17:12,928 --> 00:17:14,343
you know,
maybe it was Biaggi

381
00:17:14,378 --> 00:17:18,520
just trying
to be a bully or an idiot.

382
00:17:18,554 --> 00:17:20,901
It was deeply cynical,

383
00:17:20,936 --> 00:17:23,042
I thought,
and immensely entertaining.

384
00:17:23,076 --> 00:17:24,733
And how much
more entertaining

385
00:17:24,767 --> 00:17:27,736
when Rossi went past him
and flipped him
the finger afterwards?

386
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:29,841
This is the stuff
of great racing.

387
00:17:29,876 --> 00:17:31,740
It was certainly...

388
00:17:31,774 --> 00:17:34,260
I don't think it was
as dangerous as it looked.

389
00:17:34,294 --> 00:17:36,883
Though I don't think
it was completely safe,
either.

390
00:17:36,917 --> 00:17:39,748
It's wonderful.
They need to be careful

391
00:17:39,782 --> 00:17:41,439
doing things
like that intentionally

392
00:17:41,474 --> 00:17:43,338
'cause someone can get hurt.

393
00:17:43,372 --> 00:17:46,306
But, you know, rivalry's good. That's what racing's about.

394
00:17:46,341 --> 00:17:48,377
It's about winning,
which means

395
00:17:48,412 --> 00:17:50,828
some poor sod has gotta
come second.

396
00:17:50,862 --> 00:17:54,280
In the end, Rossi has
the last laugh of him,
anyway, doesn't he?

397
00:17:54,314 --> 00:17:55,902
ROE: That's Italian rivalry
as well, isn't it?

398
00:17:55,936 --> 00:17:57,110
BENNET: Oh, yeah.

399
00:17:57,145 --> 00:17:59,630
Unbelievable, wasn't it?
Especially with Biaggi,

400
00:17:59,664 --> 00:18:02,115
'cause it's just a big
media thing to him, isn't it?

401
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:04,704
Because Max always wants
to be in the limelight,
doesn't he?

402
00:18:04,738 --> 00:18:06,464
He wants to be
on the front of magazines,

403
00:18:06,499 --> 00:18:08,708
and he wants everyone
to think,
"Oh, yes, that's Max Biaggi."

404
00:18:08,742 --> 00:18:10,606
Well, he has been
over the years,

405
00:18:10,641 --> 00:18:12,332
especially when he was
250 World Champion,

406
00:18:12,367 --> 00:18:15,335
he was like Italy's darling,
you know, for bike racing.

407
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:17,924
But since Rossi's come in,

408
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:20,029
he's stomped all over
his ground, hasn't he?

409
00:18:20,064 --> 00:18:22,273
And I don't think Max
takes that very kindly.

410
00:18:22,308 --> 00:18:25,242
And that's just
Italian temperament,
especially from Max's side.

411
00:18:25,276 --> 00:18:26,898
I don't think so much
from Valentino's side,

412
00:18:26,933 --> 00:18:29,522
because he seems
to be pretty laid back.

413
00:18:29,556 --> 00:18:32,421
I would imagine Rossi
doesn't really take...

414
00:18:32,456 --> 00:18:34,078
too bothered
about it all, actually.

415
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,493
No, it's like he just enjoys

416
00:18:35,528 --> 00:18:37,081
-riding the bike.
-That's right.

417
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,290
He just comes across
as somebody who's trying
to enjoy himself.

418
00:18:39,325 --> 00:18:40,843
ROE: You don't ever
hear any stories

419
00:18:40,878 --> 00:18:43,018
-of him complaining
about things or...
-BENNET: No.

420
00:18:43,052 --> 00:18:44,916
ROE: He's just there
to enjoy himself

421
00:18:44,951 --> 00:18:46,332
and do the best job he can.

422
00:18:46,366 --> 00:18:48,127
And he does do
a very good job
of it, doesn't he?

423
00:18:48,161 --> 00:18:49,335
Oh, I mean,
he's the best out there,

424
00:18:49,369 --> 00:18:50,750
-isn't he, at the moment?
-Quite right.

425
00:18:50,784 --> 00:18:54,063
It's really Rossi,
when he arrived
from his paddock,

426
00:18:54,098 --> 00:18:56,031
and Biaggi
was the Italian icon,

427
00:18:56,065 --> 00:18:58,896
and Rossi started, basically,
just taking the mick.

428
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,829
Deflate it a little.

429
00:19:00,863 --> 00:19:03,280
Um... And it's grown
from there.

430
00:19:03,314 --> 00:19:05,592
MARTIN:
This young Valentino Rossi's
come along

431
00:19:05,627 --> 00:19:08,250
who's more of a character.

432
00:19:08,285 --> 00:19:11,598
There's definitely a couple of
very clever people behind him.

433
00:19:11,633 --> 00:19:14,601
He stopped out on the track
after winning the 250 race,

434
00:19:14,636 --> 00:19:18,157
and dived into the toilet
and come back out
30 seconds later.

435
00:19:18,191 --> 00:19:20,089
Everyone was cackling to
themselves, laughing.

436
00:19:20,124 --> 00:19:24,093
Max, at one stage,
was rumored to be dating
Naomi Campbell,

437
00:19:24,128 --> 00:19:27,027
and I think it had something
to do with that.
I'm not really sure.

438
00:19:27,062 --> 00:19:28,753
The Italian guys
could probably tell you.

439
00:19:28,788 --> 00:19:31,204
They just have a chuckle
and don't say a lot.

440
00:19:31,239 --> 00:19:34,621
[LAUGHING]
The inflatable doll episode.

441
00:19:34,656 --> 00:19:36,520
Let me think.
Now, at the time,

442
00:19:36,554 --> 00:19:39,005
there were reports
linking Biaggi

443
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,318
with Naomi Campbell,
I seem to recall.

444
00:19:41,352 --> 00:19:44,286
Typically shallow
celeb stuff,

445
00:19:44,321 --> 00:19:46,323
which one suspected
was probably

446
00:19:46,357 --> 00:19:48,325
serving the interest
of each of their careers

447
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:51,086
more than any personal thing.

448
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:55,746
And Rossi picked up on this,
or his fan club did.

449
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:58,231
And when he won a race,
they got an inflatable doll,

450
00:19:58,266 --> 00:20:00,509
dressed her
in a rugby jersey,
as I remember,

451
00:20:00,544 --> 00:20:03,409
but with the name
Claudia Schiffer on the back.

452
00:20:03,443 --> 00:20:05,376
And he went around
with Claudia Schiffer
on the back.

453
00:20:05,411 --> 00:20:07,309
So, you had to know
about the Biaggi thing

454
00:20:07,344 --> 00:20:09,898
to appreciate it,
but everybody did, so...

455
00:20:09,932 --> 00:20:13,833
I think
the story is very easy
about me and Max.

456
00:20:13,867 --> 00:20:16,560
We... we... We don't like...
[CHUCKLES]

457
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,563
I think is normal, no?

458
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:23,912
To have somebody
you don't like.

459
00:20:23,946 --> 00:20:27,502
And one for me is Biaggi.
And one for Biaggi is Rossi.

460
00:20:27,536 --> 00:20:32,300
So, it's okay. I think
we fight for the same target.

461
00:20:32,334 --> 00:20:34,440
McGREGOR: At the start
of the 2001 season,

462
00:20:34,474 --> 00:20:37,236
the real threat to Rossi
is arguably not Max Biaggi,

463
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:39,721
but Garry McCoy.

464
00:20:39,755 --> 00:20:42,896
In 2000, his first full season on a 500,

465
00:20:42,931 --> 00:20:46,866
McCoy won three races,
more than Rossi or Biaggi.

466
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,281
He also developed

467
00:20:48,316 --> 00:20:51,388
a spectacularly different way
of riding the bike.

468
00:20:51,422 --> 00:20:53,010
I'm trying to remember
which race it was.

469
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:55,944
We had a slow motion picture
of smoke pouring off
a back tire

470
00:20:55,978 --> 00:20:58,878
in qualifying, I think,
in Portugal or South Africa.
I can't remember which track.

471
00:20:58,912 --> 00:21:01,639
We thought, "What the...
is going on there?"

472
00:21:01,674 --> 00:21:03,538
But you realized it wasn't
an accident happening,

473
00:21:03,572 --> 00:21:05,747
or an engine blowing up,
or steam leaking off
an engine.

474
00:21:05,781 --> 00:21:07,714
It was a tire
spinning so much,

475
00:21:07,749 --> 00:21:10,890
going, say, 65 miles an hour
faster than the front tire.

476
00:21:10,924 --> 00:21:13,272
It was just lighting up
and laying smoke.

477
00:21:13,306 --> 00:21:15,204
And that's just ridiculous.

478
00:21:15,239 --> 00:21:18,794
You can't do that
on a racing 500 motorcycle
unless you're Garry McCoy.

479
00:21:18,829 --> 00:21:23,385
It was about two-thirds
or three-quarters of the way
through the first year.

480
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:26,146
Suddenly, you saw
McCoy riding quite differently

481
00:21:26,181 --> 00:21:28,252
and he gets it sideways
on the brakes,

482
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,737
and sideways
all over the place,

483
00:21:30,772 --> 00:21:32,636
and it worked.

484
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:35,224
Really. And it was
the way not to ride.

485
00:21:35,259 --> 00:21:37,606
Everyone was saying
he shouldn't be sliding
around too much.

486
00:21:37,641 --> 00:21:40,506
That's old-fashioned.
Don't need to do that.

487
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,473
-How good was that?
-Very good.

488
00:21:42,508 --> 00:21:45,856
He revolutionized it.
He really changed
everyone's thinking.

489
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:47,478
KENNY ROBERTS:
I mean, Garry adds
a different dimension

490
00:21:47,513 --> 00:21:49,342
to the Grand Prix.

491
00:21:49,377 --> 00:21:52,828
Um, at times, I think
he's over the limit

492
00:21:52,863 --> 00:21:55,935
in terms of the way
he has to ride.

493
00:21:55,969 --> 00:21:59,870
McCoy is a little bit looser
than a lot of people.
[CHUCKLES]

494
00:21:59,904 --> 00:22:02,079
He has good bike control,

495
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:05,254
but I don't necessarily think
it's the quickest way
around the racetrack.

496
00:22:05,289 --> 00:22:08,327
It's difficult
with people like that
sitting on the sideline

497
00:22:08,361 --> 00:22:10,881
saying, "You slide it too much
and whatever."

498
00:22:10,915 --> 00:22:13,677
I mean,
just look at the race
in South Africa.

499
00:22:13,711 --> 00:22:15,403
It was sideways everywhere,
and I won the race.

500
00:22:15,437 --> 00:22:17,750
So I can't really say
that's the slow way around.

501
00:22:17,784 --> 00:22:21,650
COMMENTATOR: That unique
slipping, sliding style
brings victory.

502
00:22:21,685 --> 00:22:24,688
SCOTT: McCoy's strange
wheel spinning style

503
00:22:24,722 --> 00:22:26,414
brought up
a huge breakthrough

504
00:22:26,448 --> 00:22:29,934
in understanding
of how tires work people hadn't realized before.

505
00:22:29,969 --> 00:22:31,833
They thought that
if you spin the tire,

506
00:22:31,867 --> 00:22:35,112
that's what makes it
get hot, which is true.

507
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:38,080
McCoy proved that
if you spin it a lot,

508
00:22:38,115 --> 00:22:39,806
only the surface gets hot.

509
00:22:39,841 --> 00:22:42,671
But if you can't spin it,
instead of the surface
getting hot,

510
00:22:42,706 --> 00:22:44,742
the whole carcass
of the tire heats up,

511
00:22:44,777 --> 00:22:47,331
and the carcass
of the tire gets hotter,

512
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:50,679
and that damages the tire
much more than just being
a little hot on the surface.

513
00:22:50,714 --> 00:22:52,129
McCOY: The crowd loves it,

514
00:22:52,163 --> 00:22:56,409
and if I can win races
doing it, I'll just continue.

515
00:22:56,444 --> 00:22:58,998
ROE: I've known Garry
since '98.
I know him really well.

516
00:22:59,032 --> 00:23:01,828
He was riding for Shell Advance
at the time, for Jeff Hardwick.

517
00:23:01,863 --> 00:23:05,936
Getting from a 125
onto the 500, it was a big...

518
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:09,733
physically, it was
a big shock to him.

519
00:23:09,767 --> 00:23:13,150
But he just trained quite a bit,and he got used to it.

520
00:23:13,184 --> 00:23:15,290
Then he broke his leg
at Czechoslovakia

521
00:23:15,324 --> 00:23:18,017
during Sunday morning
warm-up.

522
00:23:18,051 --> 00:23:22,539
Touched the back
of Mick Doohan on quite
a fast right-hand turn

523
00:23:22,573 --> 00:23:24,368
and ended up
breaking his leg.

524
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:27,371
So that was the end
of his '98 season.

525
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:30,443
And then, he ended up

526
00:23:30,478 --> 00:23:32,238
not doing anything
after that for a long time.

527
00:23:32,272 --> 00:23:34,861
He ended up
going back to Australia

528
00:23:34,896 --> 00:23:38,002
and doing few bits
of part-time jobs, I think,

529
00:23:38,037 --> 00:23:39,590
for his dad
and what have you.

530
00:23:39,625 --> 00:23:42,317
McCOY:
It was all a funny deal.
It left me without a ride,

531
00:23:42,351 --> 00:23:44,733
and I just sort of
gave up on racing.

532
00:23:44,768 --> 00:23:47,011
And I thought
I'd get a normal job,

533
00:23:47,046 --> 00:23:49,358
and, you know,
stop breaking bones,

534
00:23:49,393 --> 00:23:51,257
and started putting up
roller doors.

535
00:23:51,291 --> 00:23:54,260
At that time, we were
looking to replace somebody,

536
00:23:54,294 --> 00:23:56,020
and I believe it was
Hamish who said,

537
00:23:56,055 --> 00:23:58,851
"Well, gee,
what about Garry McCoy? He rode a Honda twin last year.

538
00:23:58,885 --> 00:24:00,646
"He broke his leg
and had a terrible year.

539
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,993
"And he might be
just the thing."

540
00:24:03,027 --> 00:24:05,858
JAMIESON:
He did half of '99,
all of 2000.

541
00:24:05,892 --> 00:24:08,481
So he's been, like,
two years on the bike,

542
00:24:08,516 --> 00:24:10,414
which is still
a relatively short time

543
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,416
compared to a lot
of his competitors.

544
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,038
He is improving a lot.

545
00:24:14,073 --> 00:24:17,076
BENNET: You see
these big slides
he does on the TV,

546
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:19,319
and, I mean,
some of them are big ones.

547
00:24:19,354 --> 00:24:21,598
And he comes
in the garage afterwards,

548
00:24:21,632 --> 00:24:24,497
and we may be laughing,
"Did you see that?"

549
00:24:24,532 --> 00:24:26,534
Well, he's done it
and forgot it,

550
00:24:26,568 --> 00:24:28,156
or didn't even notice
he'd done it.

551
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:29,709
-You know, doesn't he?
-ROE: Aye, he does.

552
00:24:29,744 --> 00:24:32,125
He doesn't talk about it
or nothing.
He's not big-headed.

553
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,162
-ROE: He never brags
about things, does he?
-No, no, not at all.

554
00:24:34,196 --> 00:24:36,440
-Just gets on it and rides it.
-BENNET: Not at all.

555
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,028
McCOY: Yeah, I used
to do Speedway,

556
00:24:38,062 --> 00:24:40,099
and a bit of dirt track
and motocross.

557
00:24:40,133 --> 00:24:41,997
A lot of, you know,
dirt background.

558
00:24:42,032 --> 00:24:44,034
I feel comfortable
on the bike doing that.

559
00:24:44,068 --> 00:24:46,588
Just sort of
rolling the throttle,
playing with it.

560
00:24:46,623 --> 00:24:49,488
Obviously, if you just
hold it full throttle,

561
00:24:49,522 --> 00:24:52,007
it's just gonna, you know,
wheel spin itself silly.

562
00:24:52,042 --> 00:24:53,802
So you've just got to
sort of roll it off a bit

563
00:24:53,837 --> 00:24:56,529
and try and transfer
a bit more weight
to the back.

564
00:24:57,875 --> 00:25:00,084
And that's it. It's easy.

565
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:01,569
[LAUGHS]

566
00:25:09,059 --> 00:25:12,441
GEMMA VOCES: I never think
he's going to crash.
I don't like to think that.

567
00:25:12,476 --> 00:25:15,272
And then if he crash,
the first thing I see is

568
00:25:15,306 --> 00:25:19,483
if he is walking
or if he is still
on the floor.

569
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,071
You're just caught up
with the moment,

570
00:25:21,105 --> 00:25:24,661
and the concern
for his initial safety

571
00:25:24,695 --> 00:25:26,732
and purely
the personal thing.

572
00:25:26,766 --> 00:25:30,045
He's got up.
You know he's okay.
That's the main thing.

573
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,221
He's walking.
He seems to be okay.
Oh, he's holding his wrist.

574
00:25:33,255 --> 00:25:36,431
You can see the fracture
here on this bone.

575
00:25:36,465 --> 00:25:41,229
And it's not a big injury,
but the problem is
on the joint.

576
00:25:41,263 --> 00:25:43,300
It's a serious one
because it affects
your ability

577
00:25:43,334 --> 00:25:44,922
to ride the motorcycle
so severely.

578
00:25:44,957 --> 00:25:47,235
It's fundamental
to your grip
of the handlebars,

579
00:25:47,269 --> 00:25:50,100
and especially
under, sort of, braking,

580
00:25:50,134 --> 00:25:52,654
all the force that's thrown
onto the handlebars.

581
00:25:52,689 --> 00:25:55,864
Your own weight demands
a lot of strength
from the wrist,

582
00:25:55,899 --> 00:25:58,453
and basically, a broken
scaphoid destroys that.

583
00:25:58,487 --> 00:26:00,973
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

584
00:26:04,977 --> 00:26:08,601
MAN: The smallest accidents
can have fearful consequences

585
00:26:08,636 --> 00:26:12,363
and the most extraordinary
180 mile an hour

586
00:26:12,398 --> 00:26:14,849
end over end
into the gravel trap.

587
00:26:14,883 --> 00:26:17,368
People get up and walk away.

588
00:26:17,403 --> 00:26:19,681
JAMIESON: We always like
to try and understand
why it happened.

589
00:26:19,716 --> 00:26:22,719
When a rider's
riding well and the bike's
working good,

590
00:26:22,753 --> 00:26:24,548
everything's working
good together.

591
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:28,103
So you're getting close
to the limit of the
performance of everything.

592
00:26:28,138 --> 00:26:31,624
Then there's a certain risk.
You know, where is the limit?

593
00:26:31,659 --> 00:26:34,144
In that case,
Garry went over the limit.

594
00:26:34,178 --> 00:26:36,940
You know, he was a little
bit quicker than he'd been

595
00:26:36,974 --> 00:26:39,736
previously into
a particular corner.

596
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:43,118
And a combination of factors.

597
00:26:43,153 --> 00:26:48,020
The tire was quite new,
hadn't been used so much
on the left hand side.

598
00:26:48,054 --> 00:26:49,953
Adjustments we were trying
to the bike,

599
00:26:49,987 --> 00:26:52,196
just pushed it over
the limit and he crashed.

600
00:26:53,025 --> 00:26:54,647
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

601
00:27:29,371 --> 00:27:30,718
That kind of crash
is the worst.

602
00:27:30,752 --> 00:27:33,272
Uh, at least,
I was, uh, lucky.

603
00:27:33,306 --> 00:27:35,205
Never get a big injury.

604
00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:37,517
Nothing broken.
Just pain everywhere.

605
00:27:37,552 --> 00:27:40,900
This is stable because
we never feel it.

606
00:27:42,143 --> 00:27:44,524
Before, then we
are in the sky
and you feel it,

607
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:47,631
and you say, "Okay,
it's too late. You cannot
do anything."

608
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,322
We have a lot of protection.

609
00:27:49,357 --> 00:27:53,499
We have protection here,
we have protection here,
we have protection here.

610
00:27:53,533 --> 00:27:56,675
Every time we try
to improve the leather.

611
00:27:56,709 --> 00:27:59,056
Because when you have
the big crash,

612
00:27:59,091 --> 00:28:03,785
you understand that
what is the problem
and you try to fix it.

613
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:08,410
Shinya Nakano's Gauloises suit
made of kangaroo.

614
00:28:08,445 --> 00:28:10,861
The thickness is
1.1 millimeters.

615
00:28:10,896 --> 00:28:14,900
Kangaroo, yeah, because
the weight is half weight

616
00:28:14,934 --> 00:28:16,729
than compared to the cow.

617
00:28:16,764 --> 00:28:18,524
Half weight and, uh,

618
00:28:18,558 --> 00:28:20,422
maybe two or three times
more strong.

619
00:28:20,457 --> 00:28:22,286
TROLLI: 'Cause Shinya
comes out with some ideas.

620
00:28:22,321 --> 00:28:24,633
He suggests a different
kind of padding inside.

621
00:28:24,668 --> 00:28:28,292
By the hips section, uh,
different thickness,

622
00:28:28,327 --> 00:28:30,812
we test it and it worked out
pretty good.

623
00:28:30,847 --> 00:28:33,366
And now we pass it
over to other racers.

624
00:28:35,506 --> 00:28:39,476
The back protector,
I invented it in 1973.

625
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:42,755
I made it,
and the end of '77,

626
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:45,344
I gave it to Dianese to copy.

627
00:28:45,378 --> 00:28:48,071
I formed, uh, the plastic part

628
00:28:48,105 --> 00:28:50,487
with old visors
from a helmet

629
00:28:50,521 --> 00:28:52,800
and I formed it so that
it would bend forward

630
00:28:52,834 --> 00:28:54,629
but it wouldn't
bend backwards.

631
00:28:54,663 --> 00:28:56,665
TROLLI: The things
that the guys wear help.

632
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,427
But fundamentally,
you haven't got
to hit anything.

633
00:28:59,461 --> 00:29:01,360
And that's where
the design of the tracks

634
00:29:01,394 --> 00:29:05,191
and to a lesser extent,
the air fence. Um,
but mainly it's run-off.

635
00:29:11,784 --> 00:29:13,130
CHECA: For example,
in Japan one time,

636
00:29:13,165 --> 00:29:17,652
I crashed
270 kilometers per hour
and I was sliding,

637
00:29:18,308 --> 00:29:19,896
but nothing happened.

638
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:22,415
ROBERTS: Virtually all
the Grand Prix tracks,

639
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:26,661
you have so much
run-off room that

640
00:29:26,695 --> 00:29:29,698
it would be a freak accident
to get seriously injured.

641
00:29:29,733 --> 00:29:33,254
Where when I first came
to Europe, that wasn't
the case.

642
00:29:33,288 --> 00:29:36,153
There were some racetracks
where you would get
seriously killed,

643
00:29:36,188 --> 00:29:37,499
uh, if you fell off.

644
00:29:37,534 --> 00:29:39,053
CLIFFORD: If a rider
ran off the track,

645
00:29:39,087 --> 00:29:41,124
he was... A good chance
he'd hit the side
of the house

646
00:29:41,158 --> 00:29:42,884
or a telegraph pole
or something like that.

647
00:29:42,919 --> 00:29:45,922
All that has gone.
They're all purpose built
racetracks now

648
00:29:45,956 --> 00:29:48,027
or with a lot of clear
road at the side.

649
00:29:48,062 --> 00:29:49,857
And, you know, there's
a very good chance

650
00:29:49,891 --> 00:29:52,929
if the rider slides off,
he just slides across
the grass,

651
00:29:52,963 --> 00:29:55,345
into the gravel track,
gets up and walks away.

652
00:29:55,379 --> 00:29:58,348
It's the nasty kind
of awkward falls

653
00:29:58,382 --> 00:30:00,350
that Garry, like the one
that Garry had,

654
00:30:00,384 --> 00:30:02,490
where he's thrown
into the air and he
falls awkwardly.

655
00:30:02,524 --> 00:30:04,285
RYDER: Of course,
it's a dangerous sport,

656
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:05,734
but when you get

657
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,772
to this level in any sport,

658
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:11,844
it's amazing how many people
are playing football,

659
00:30:11,879 --> 00:30:16,124
sprinting, cycling
while injured in some way.

660
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:19,887
Top level sportsmen
are very rarely at 100%.

661
00:30:19,921 --> 00:30:22,855
You know, there was times
that I, you know, I was
riding with broken bones.

662
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:26,721
We all have.
Broken bones in my hands
and in your feet

663
00:30:26,755 --> 00:30:29,551
and, you know,
ribs and cracked stuff.

664
00:30:29,586 --> 00:30:31,830
So, you know, you just,
you just suck it up.

665
00:30:31,864 --> 00:30:34,660
And you just find
ways to, uh,

666
00:30:35,937 --> 00:30:37,352
ride around the stuff.

667
00:30:37,387 --> 00:30:40,079
I rode with
a dislocated wrist
for the last four laps.

668
00:30:40,114 --> 00:30:42,254
I'd been swung up

00:54:20,326 --> 00:54:23,087
asking John to help them,
at 12 years old.

998
00:54:23,121 --> 00:54:24,295
You've got to be smooth

999
00:54:24,330 --> 00:54:28,299
and consistent
on the asphalt to win.

1000
00:54:28,334 --> 00:54:31,751
John always put on
that extra little bit
of effort,

1001
00:54:31,785 --> 00:54:33,028
I think, in road racing

1002
00:54:33,062 --> 00:54:34,926
because there weren't
that many kids around.

1003
00:54:34,961 --> 00:54:37,170
LYONS: So that's when
John Ulrich really started
taking a notice.

1004
00:54:37,204 --> 00:54:39,655
New Year's Day, '99,
I think it was,

1005
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:43,694
I got a phone call
from Linda Hopkins.

1006
00:54:43,728 --> 00:54:44,798
When Roy was really sick

1007
00:54:44,833 --> 00:54:47,249
and just before he died,
he said to me...

1008
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:49,113
He'd talked to John

1009
00:54:49,147 --> 00:54:54,325
and John said
that he was gonna
do his best in his racing,

1010
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:55,671
and he promised his dad that.

1011
00:54:55,706 --> 00:54:58,295
And he also said

1012
00:54:58,329 --> 00:54:59,951
that if I ever
needed any help,

1013
00:55:00,676 --> 00:55:02,437
to go to John Ulrich,

1014
00:55:02,471 --> 00:55:04,024
because he trusted him.

1015
00:55:04,059 --> 00:55:05,474
ULRICH:
She wanted to know,

1016
00:55:05,509 --> 00:55:07,304
is it true that he couldn't
have a road racing career,

1017
00:55:07,338 --> 00:55:08,822
if he was finished
in road racing.

1018
00:55:08,857 --> 00:55:11,515
LINDA: There was no money
and he needed to advance.

1019
00:55:11,549 --> 00:55:14,069
ULRICH: I went out
and I got this Aprilia RS250,

1020
00:55:14,103 --> 00:55:17,486
because they were
going to have this
Aprilia RS250 Cup series.

1021
00:55:17,521 --> 00:55:19,108
It was new in the United States that year.

1022
00:55:19,143 --> 00:55:20,800
We flew him to Road Atlanta

1023
00:55:20,834 --> 00:55:22,249
for the first race
in the series.

1024
00:55:22,284 --> 00:55:24,459
And, you know, I knew the kid
was pretty good, okay.

1025
00:55:24,493 --> 00:55:26,323
But I didn't know
how good he was.

1026
00:55:26,357 --> 00:55:28,601
He was running around
in third place,

1027
00:55:28,635 --> 00:55:30,119
two laps from the end
of this race.

1028
00:55:30,154 --> 00:55:32,536
Now that's pretty good.
He's going to win about $750.

1029
00:55:32,570 --> 00:55:35,470
And I'm figuring, okay,
we're going to about
break even on this deal.

1030
00:55:35,504 --> 00:55:36,954
Next thing I know,
he wins the race.

1031
00:55:41,268 --> 00:55:42,718
So we took him to Loudon,
New Hampshire,

1032
00:55:42,753 --> 00:55:44,479
a notoriously
difficult racetrack,

1033
00:55:44,513 --> 00:55:45,480
and put him on this 600,

1034
00:55:45,514 --> 00:55:47,758
and again,
he was instantly fast,

1035
00:55:47,792 --> 00:55:50,347
qualified in the front row
for the 750 Supersport race.

1036
00:55:50,381 --> 00:55:51,900
I'm sitting in the pits

1037
00:55:51,934 --> 00:55:54,143
thinking about
what has just happened.

1038
00:55:54,178 --> 00:55:55,593
We've just taken this kid,

1039
00:55:55,628 --> 00:55:57,146
we've taken him
from one type of motorcycle,

1040
00:55:57,181 --> 00:55:58,596
put him on a complete
different motorcycle,

1041
00:55:58,631 --> 00:56:00,736
taken him to a completely
different type of racetrack,

1042
00:56:00,771 --> 00:56:02,359
another track he's never seen,

1043
00:56:02,393 --> 00:56:04,153
and he's found a way
to go way faster

1044
00:56:04,188 --> 00:56:05,396
than he should be going.

1045
00:56:05,431 --> 00:56:07,018
And my cell phone rings

1046
00:56:07,053 --> 00:56:09,538
and it's Peter Clifford
from Red Bull Yamaha.

1047
00:56:09,573 --> 00:56:10,850
And what he says to me is,

1048
00:56:10,884 --> 00:56:13,473
"I need the next
Kevin Schwantz.

1049
00:56:13,508 --> 00:56:14,716
"Do you have
another Kevin Schwantz?"

1050
00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:16,718
And I, I said to him,

1051
00:56:16,752 --> 00:56:17,822
"I think I just...

1052
00:56:17,857 --> 00:56:19,237
"I think I've got one.

1053
00:56:19,272 --> 00:56:20,963
"I think I just found one."

1054
00:56:20,998 --> 00:56:22,551
CLIFFORD: John Ulrich
is genuinely

1055
00:56:22,586 --> 00:56:24,933
the guy who discovered
Kevin Schwantz.

1056
00:56:24,967 --> 00:56:27,487
So when he says that this guy is something special,

1057
00:56:27,522 --> 00:56:28,868
I took a great deal
of notice.

1058
00:56:28,902 --> 00:56:30,421
ULRICH: Any reasonable
expectation

1059
00:56:30,456 --> 00:56:32,285
you had for him,
he leapfrogged.

1060
00:56:32,319 --> 00:56:34,460
In a lot of ways,
he was like Kevin,

1061
00:56:34,494 --> 00:56:36,047
except we found him earlier.

1062
00:56:36,082 --> 00:56:38,705
When we figured this out
about John, he was 16.

1063
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:41,018
When we figured this out
about Kevin, he was 19.

1064
00:56:41,052 --> 00:56:43,917
A good guy
can ride a motorcycle fast,

1065
00:56:43,952 --> 00:56:44,953
whatever it is
you give him.

1066
00:56:44,987 --> 00:56:46,368
But if you put him on a 500

1067
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:48,232
and you give him
enough time on that bike,

1068
00:56:48,266 --> 00:56:49,509
he's gonna be going
about as fast

1069
00:56:49,544 --> 00:56:51,097
as you can go on that 500

1070
00:56:51,131 --> 00:56:53,479
within 12 months, 18 months.

1071
00:56:53,513 --> 00:56:54,549
This kid is special.

1072
00:56:56,274 --> 00:56:58,035
DESIREE CROSSMAN: He wants to get in the top 10 this year.

1073
00:56:58,069 --> 00:56:59,623
And then next year,
he wants to go

1074
00:56:59,657 --> 00:57:01,590
even top five,
if not the Championship.

McGREGOR: 2002, the sound
of a new era.

1080
00:57:38,731 --> 00:57:39,939
The game has new rules.

1081
00:57:40,974 --> 00:57:43,529
Two-stroke engines
up to 500cc

1082
00:57:43,563 --> 00:57:46,290
or four-strokes up to 990cc.

1083
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:48,982
In theory, they should be
about equal.

1084
00:57:50,328 --> 00:57:52,158
On March the 9th in Catalunya,

1085
00:57:52,192 --> 00:57:55,472
in the final test before
the racing begins in Japan,

1086
00:57:55,506 --> 00:57:57,819
the teams take
to the track to find out.

1087
00:57:57,853 --> 00:57:59,959
SCOTT: Well, today is obviously
a very important day

1088
00:57:59,993 --> 00:58:01,685
for Grand Prix
racing in general,

1089
00:58:01,719 --> 00:58:04,308
the first time the new generation of machines

1090
00:58:04,342 --> 00:58:06,552
have been seen
in public together.

1091
00:58:07,794 --> 00:58:11,004
This year is the first year
of the MotoGP,

1092
00:58:11,039 --> 00:58:12,316
as they want to call it.

1093
00:58:12,350 --> 00:58:13,524
It's two separate races.

1094
00:58:13,559 --> 00:58:14,939
And next year,

1095
00:58:14,974 --> 00:58:17,666
I don't think there will be
any two-strokes at all.

1096
00:58:17,701 --> 00:58:20,635
The two-stroke is igniting
the mixture in the cylinder,

1097
00:58:20,669 --> 00:58:21,739
and it's producing power

1098
00:58:21,774 --> 00:58:23,603
every revolution
of the crankshaft

1099
00:58:23,638 --> 00:58:25,502
twice as often
as a four-stroke.

1100
00:58:26,330 --> 00:58:27,918
You can make more power

1101
00:58:27,952 --> 00:58:29,540
per engine size
out of a two-stroke.

1102
00:58:29,575 --> 00:58:31,646
So a 500 two-stroke,
theoretically,

1103
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:34,683
is the rough equivalent
of about a 1000cc
four-stroke.

1104
00:58:34,718 --> 00:58:35,926
The four-stroke race bikes

1105
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:37,859
that are now running
in the MotoGP series

1106
00:58:39,067 --> 00:58:42,104
are gonna put that
equation to, uh, to death.

[REVVING]

1108
00:58:44,175 --> 00:58:46,039
SCOTT: Looks like Honda
has just come up

1109
00:58:46,074 --> 00:58:48,455
with something so good,
staggeringly good.

1110

All Yamaha
and the rest can do

1111
00:58:50,112 --> 00:58:52,149
is say, "Well, how much
did they spend?"

1112
00:58:52,183 --> 00:58:54,496
And clearly,
a tremendous amount of money.

1113
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:56,498
VALENTINO: The new bike
is exciting.

1114
00:58:56,533 --> 00:59:00,951
It's good, more powerful,
have 220 horsepower,

1115
00:59:00,985 --> 00:59:04,541
but the 500, for me,
was more exciting.

1116
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:06,715
This one is more sweet.

1117
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:08,890
SCOTT: The two-strokes
are a very fine edge,

1118
00:59:08,924 --> 00:59:11,064
but the four-strokes
are more fun to watch,

1119
00:59:11,099 --> 00:59:12,894
because they're looser
and wilder,

1120
00:59:12,928 --> 00:59:15,344
and they go sideways
on the brakes

1121
00:59:15,379 --> 00:59:16,760
and bounce around
into the corners.

00:59:16,794 --> 00:59:18,278

get away with more.

The Moto Grand Prix bikes

1130
00:59:36,952 --> 00:59:38,505

They might not win
by so much, though.

They'll find it harder.

1137
00:59:54,107 --> 00:59:59,526
I would say today,
you can't run a MotoGP team
for under $6 million dollars.

1138
00:59:59,561 --> 01:00:02,115
The salaries for a rider,
the extremes are incredible.

1139
01:00:02,150 --> 01:00:05,222
If Rossi gets $5 or $6 million at the one end,

1140
01:00:05,256 --> 01:00:06,361
you might have a rider

1141
01:00:06,395 --> 01:00:09,813
that gets $100,000
at the bottom end.

1142
01:00:09,847 --> 01:00:12,470
So that's a huge number
in a budget.

1143
01:00:12,505 --> 01:00:14,369
The second component,
obviously, is the technology.

1144
01:00:14,403 --> 01:00:16,958
Do you lease it?
Do you buy it?
Do you make it?

1145
01:00:16,992 --> 01:00:18,718
And there's
millions of dollars there.

1146
01:00:18,753 --> 01:00:20,444
And then there's
the over-the-road costs,

01:00:20,478 --> 01:00:23,620

airplane fares and so on.

[CHUCKLES] It's, uh,
definitely real money.

1150

Rider-wise, we had
Noriyuki Haga last year.

with the team anymore.

01:01:03,107 --> 01:01:05,662
I'm driving up the hill
right here is real fun.

1164
01:01:05,696 --> 01:01:07,111
You're wide open
around here,

1165
01:01:07,146 --> 01:01:08,216
around this right-hander,

1166
01:01:08,250 --> 01:01:10,252
just sliding it
all the way up the hill.

1167
01:01:10,287 --> 01:01:12,254
You can do a lot more stuff
on this game than,

1168
01:01:12,289 --> 01:01:14,912
you know,
you couldn't really do
on a motorcycle.

1169
01:01:14,947 --> 01:01:16,224
MAN: Oh, ow!

1170
01:01:16,258 --> 01:01:17,743
JOHN: You know, he came
right down on his head.

1171
01:01:17,777 --> 01:01:19,054
You know,
I don't know why he's

1172
01:01:19,089 --> 01:01:20,642
getting up and riding again.

1173
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:22,437
-He should be sitting
out for the day.
-[MAN CHUCKLES]

1174
01:01:22,471 --> 01:01:23,576
Maybe the next day, too.

1175
01:01:23,610 --> 01:01:25,336
It definitely
won't teach you anything

1176
01:01:25,371 --> 01:01:27,373
about riding the bike
in general.

1177
01:01:27,407 --> 01:01:29,306
The only thing,
you know, I'm actually

1178
01:01:29,340 --> 01:01:30,721
learning a whole bunch about

1179
01:01:30,756 --> 01:01:33,344
is, uh,
is where the track goes.

1180
01:01:35,243 --> 01:01:37,038
JOHN: The bike reacts
to your body position.

1181
01:01:37,072 --> 01:01:38,280
You're tucked down
under the bubble,

1182
01:01:38,315 --> 01:01:39,868
staying as low as possible,

1183
01:01:39,903 --> 01:01:41,490
less wind resistance,
pushing down

1184
01:01:41,525 --> 01:01:43,147
on the pegs,
real hard braking.

1185
01:01:43,182 --> 01:01:44,908
Long, sweeping left-hander,

1186
01:01:44,942 --> 01:01:46,323
working your way
on the throttle,

1187
01:01:46,357 --> 01:01:47,531
getting on it harder
and harder.

1188
01:01:47,565 --> 01:01:48,946
You got to move real fast,

1189
01:01:48,981 --> 01:01:50,292
pushing down with your legs

1190
01:01:50,327 --> 01:01:51,742
and switch back over
to the right.

1191
01:01:51,777 --> 01:01:54,434
Hang off pretty far
to the right,
using your body.

1192
01:01:54,469 --> 01:01:56,160
You've got to get over
the front of the bike

1193
01:01:56,195 --> 01:01:57,196
to keep the front wheel down.

1194
01:01:58,784 --> 01:02:00,751
STEWART MILLER: You're braking
from 180 miles an hour

1195
01:02:00,786 --> 01:02:02,684
to sometimes 40 miles an hour

1196
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:06,032
in the space of 100 meters.

1197
01:02:06,067 --> 01:02:08,759
That's a lot of weight
on the shoulders and arms.

1198
01:02:08,794 --> 01:02:12,867
Each track he brakes
1,000 times, 1,000 times.

1199
01:02:12,901 --> 01:02:14,903
Pretty much everybody
now has a trainer

1200
01:02:14,938 --> 01:02:16,008
that follows them,
pushes them

1201
01:02:16,042 --> 01:02:17,319
through the gym.
They're athletes.

1202
01:02:17,354 --> 01:02:18,769
RYDER: Back in the late '70s,
with Barry Sheene

1203
01:02:18,804 --> 01:02:20,081
and the young
Kenny Roberts' idea

1204
01:02:20,115 --> 01:02:21,461
of a night before the race

1205
01:02:21,496 --> 01:02:22,773
probably involved a nightclub,

1206
01:02:22,808 --> 01:02:24,948
large amounts of alcohol,
beer, cigarettes,

1207
01:02:24,982 --> 01:02:27,019
and getting home
in a crashed hire car

1208
01:02:27,053 --> 01:02:28,261
at about 3:00
in the morning.

1209
01:02:28,296 --> 01:02:30,160
Kenny, who now
makes his riders, you know,

1210
01:02:30,194 --> 01:02:32,852
eat pasta, drink orange juice
and go to bed early.

1211
01:02:32,887 --> 01:02:34,543
They treat their diet,
their training

1212
01:02:34,578 --> 01:02:37,167
the same as other
absolute top level athletes.

1213
01:02:37,201 --> 01:02:39,065
Legs are a big part. I mean...

1214
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:41,309
You got to drive straight
from a hairpin,

1215
01:02:41,343 --> 01:02:43,863
get the thing hung out
on your knee

1216
01:02:43,898 --> 01:02:45,071
and then from there
just carry it.

1217
01:02:46,728 --> 01:02:48,730
SHEENE: They use their knees
a lot more now.

1218
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:50,663
Like Valentino,
as an example, you know,

1219
01:02:50,697 --> 01:02:52,423
he'll get through
a set of knee sliders

1220
01:02:52,458 --> 01:02:55,012
in half a day sort of thing.

1221
01:02:55,047 --> 01:02:56,255
Kenny Roberts' era,

1222
01:02:56,289 --> 01:02:58,636
that's when you really
started to see the body

1223
01:02:58,671 --> 01:03:00,052
play more of an active role

1224
01:03:00,086 --> 01:03:01,950
in what
the motorcycle's doing.

1225
01:03:01,985 --> 01:03:03,918
Before that,
it was sitting on top of

1226
01:03:03,952 --> 01:03:05,540
the motorcycle
and bending it in

1227
01:03:05,574 --> 01:03:08,508
and, you know, you don't
dare move on the thing.

1228
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:10,338
ROBERTS: I got a lot
of experience from
dirt track racing.

1229
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:12,961
When it's going
sideways like that,

1230
01:03:12,996 --> 01:03:16,344
you have to have
something planted
on the ground

1231
01:03:16,378 --> 01:03:19,036
to keep your weight
in the same position.

1232
01:03:19,071 --> 01:03:22,005
I raced indoor races
on concrete

1233
01:03:22,039 --> 01:03:24,248
and I used to put Supertape
on the bottom of your shoes

1234
01:03:24,283 --> 01:03:27,700
so the shoe would
actually slide
on the concrete,

1235
01:03:27,734 --> 01:03:29,322
so you could keep it
underneath you.

1236
01:03:29,357 --> 01:03:31,014
But when I started
dragging my knees,

1237
01:03:31,048 --> 01:03:33,154
you couldn't drag it
with the leather

1238
01:03:33,188 --> 01:03:34,293
because the leather would catch

1239
01:03:34,327 --> 01:03:36,088
and jerk your foot
off the foot peg.

1240
01:03:36,122 --> 01:03:38,090
And I started putting
Supertape on my knees.

1241
01:03:38,124 --> 01:03:39,332
And it's just like,
"Wait a minute.

1242
01:03:39,367 --> 01:03:40,299
"What are you doing?

1243
01:03:40,333 --> 01:03:41,679
[STUTTERS]
"What are you doing?"

1244
01:03:41,714 --> 01:03:43,647
I mean, no one did it.

1245
01:03:43,681 --> 01:03:45,304
No one thought about it.
No one did it.

1246
01:03:45,338 --> 01:03:49,101
It would have been
somewhere around '72.

1247
01:03:49,135 --> 01:03:52,656
In 1973,
I started riding a 750.

1248
01:03:52,690 --> 01:03:54,658
My brother-in-law,
Paul Smart,

1249
01:03:54,692 --> 01:03:56,418
was very good on a big bike.

1250
01:03:56,453 --> 01:03:58,248
So I said to Paul,
"You know, this thing,

1251
01:03:58,282 --> 01:03:59,870
"as soon as I
get it over sideways,

1252
01:03:59,905 --> 01:04:01,492
"it sort of drags
on the ground."

1253
01:04:01,527 --> 01:04:03,494
He said, "Well,
hang off it more."

1254
01:04:03,529 --> 01:04:05,289
I just rode
and let my knee hang out.

1255
01:04:05,324 --> 01:04:07,740
And then sometimes
it'd touch on the ground.

1256
01:04:07,774 --> 01:04:09,121
If your knee's
on the ground, obviously,

1257
01:04:09,155 --> 01:04:12,124
you can adjust your weight
with the knee.

1258
01:04:12,158 --> 01:04:14,160
You'd know exactly
where the motorcycle's at

1259
01:04:14,195 --> 01:04:15,748
because you're controlling
the back wheel

1260
01:04:15,782 --> 01:04:17,854
with the throttle
and lean angle.

1261
01:04:17,888 --> 01:04:20,753
And I'd like to steer the bike
with the back wheel.

1262
01:04:20,787 --> 01:04:22,859
And I could do it
on some racetracks

1263
01:04:22,893 --> 01:04:25,206
and do it
fairly proficiently.

1264
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:28,623
The rear wheel steering thing
didn't really happen

1265
01:04:28,657 --> 01:04:30,487
until Kenny
had retired from racing.

1266
01:04:31,557 --> 01:04:33,041
You know,
the rear wheel steering thing

1267
01:04:33,076 --> 01:04:35,630
started when
the radial tires came in.

1268
01:04:35,664 --> 01:04:37,425
Barry steered the motorcycle
with the front wheel,

1269
01:04:37,459 --> 01:04:39,116
and I steered it
with the back wheel.

1270
01:04:39,151 --> 01:04:42,154
So, it's two
different theories of riding.

1271
01:04:42,188 --> 01:04:44,156
Yeah, he used
to slide the bike.

1272
01:04:44,190 --> 01:04:45,916
The bike used
to step out and that.

1273
01:04:45,951 --> 01:04:47,297
Yes, that happens
to everybody.

1274
01:04:47,331 --> 01:04:49,161
I don't think
he really understood it

1275
01:04:49,195 --> 01:04:51,301
because he never
really got there with it.

1276
01:04:51,335 --> 01:04:53,544
He was two-time
World Champion, as I said.

1277
01:04:53,579 --> 01:04:55,892
So who's gonna show him
anything different?

1278
01:04:55,926 --> 01:04:57,928
It's not like some Yank's
gonna come over here

1279
01:04:57,963 --> 01:05:00,103
and say, "Oh, this is the way
you need to ride."

1280
01:05:00,137 --> 01:05:03,934
It started
when the horsepower

1281
01:05:03,969 --> 01:05:06,005
exceeded the abilities
of the tires

1282
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:07,144
and the riders had to find

1283
01:05:07,179 --> 01:05:10,147
other ways of continuing
to race fast,

1284
01:05:10,182 --> 01:05:11,769
especially over
a long race distance.

1285
01:05:11,804 --> 01:05:14,117
It required
a different kind of skill

1286
01:05:14,151 --> 01:05:16,567
which favored
all the American
dirt trackers.

1287
01:05:16,602 --> 01:05:20,502
That gave rise
to the whole era
of American champions,

1288
01:05:20,537 --> 01:05:22,435
'cause they were schooled
in that art

1289
01:05:22,470 --> 01:05:24,644
of being able to ride
the motorcycle

1290
01:05:24,679 --> 01:05:27,371
when it didn't grip
the road anymore,

1291
01:05:27,406 --> 01:05:29,339
when every time
you opened the throttle,
the back wheel would spin

1292
01:05:29,373 --> 01:05:30,685
instead of driving
them forward.

1293
01:05:30,719 --> 01:05:32,894
And you had to slide it
to go around the corner.

1294
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:35,552
And that's receded a bit

1295
01:05:35,586 --> 01:05:37,347
with the improvement
in tires,

1296
01:05:37,381 --> 01:05:39,280
but it still holds good,
I think,

1297
01:05:39,314 --> 01:05:40,937
yeah, especially towards
the end of a race.

1298
01:05:40,971 --> 01:05:43,249
That's when you see
the good guys really show up,

1299
01:05:43,284 --> 01:05:45,010
is when things
are getting tough

1300
01:05:45,044 --> 01:05:46,494
and the bikes
have developed problems

1301
01:05:46,528 --> 01:05:47,874
and they've got to ride
around the problem.

1302
01:05:53,915 --> 01:05:55,296
McGREGOR:
At the Catalunya test,

1303
01:05:55,330 --> 01:05:58,023
Hopkins completes
over 100 laps,

1304
01:05:58,057 --> 01:06:00,128
twice as many
as most of the riders.

1305
01:06:00,163 --> 01:06:01,681
He falls once
but is unhurt.

1306
01:06:03,476 --> 01:06:04,788
McCoy's bike,
on the other hand,

1307
01:06:04,822 --> 01:06:06,307
hasn't turned a wheel,

1308
01:06:06,341 --> 01:06:08,481
because McCoy isn't here.

1309
01:06:08,516 --> 01:06:11,312
At the last test, two weeks
earlier in Portugal,

1310
01:06:11,346 --> 01:06:13,279
he was the fastest man
on the track.

1311
01:06:13,314 --> 01:06:15,005
McCOY: The temperature
was dropping.

1312
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:16,938
It was quite windy that day.

1313
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:18,836
As I went into the corner,

1314
01:06:18,871 --> 01:06:20,528
the back started
to come around on me

1315
01:06:20,562 --> 01:06:22,012
and it kicked back a bit.

1316
01:06:22,047 --> 01:06:23,358
I ended up
on top of the bike.

1317
01:06:23,393 --> 01:06:24,911
I landed on top
of the screen

1318
01:06:25,878 --> 01:06:27,466
and then I sort of fell off...

1319
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:29,295
Well, fell onto the ground
on my feet

1320
01:06:29,330 --> 01:06:32,678
in front of the bike
with my right leg.

1321
01:06:32,712 --> 01:06:35,232
Um, I felt the bike hitting me in the back of the leg.

1322
01:06:35,267 --> 01:06:37,545
Yeah, and they had to
go from under the kneecap,

1323
01:06:37,579 --> 01:06:39,340
put in a big titanium rod.

1324
01:06:39,374 --> 01:06:41,066
It's through the whole tibia.

1325
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:42,308
That's where they went in
with the pin.

1326
01:06:43,516 --> 01:06:45,587
Screw here. Screw there.
It's pretty clean.

1327
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:49,729
Well, there's just, like,
three screw holes down there.

1328
01:06:49,764 --> 01:06:51,076
This year we've done
so well in testing.

1329
01:06:51,110 --> 01:06:54,251
We've been first everywhere
and doing it easy.

1330
01:06:54,286 --> 01:06:55,908
And then
you have one little fall.

1331
01:06:55,942 --> 01:06:57,772
It's my first fall
of the year.

1332
01:06:59,084 --> 01:07:01,845
I've had a few thoughts
in my mind, anyway,

1333
01:07:01,879 --> 01:07:03,433
of, you know, how long
is this going to last

1334
01:07:03,467 --> 01:07:05,228
or how long
is my body going to last?

1335
01:07:05,262 --> 01:07:08,886
Hopefully, it's going to be
a few more years yet.

1336
01:07:08,921 --> 01:07:11,372
And do the best I can
and hopefully, one day,

1337
01:07:11,406 --> 01:07:13,029
or this year,
I'll win a World Championship.

1338
01:07:17,964 --> 01:07:19,345
BENNET:
It's disappointing because,

1339
01:07:19,380 --> 01:07:20,967
again, Garry's doing so well,

1340
01:07:21,002 --> 01:07:22,521
and then it all went wrong

1341
01:07:22,555 --> 01:07:24,488
for want of another word,
didn't it?

1342
01:07:24,523 --> 01:07:26,111
These sort of things happen,
don't they?

1343
01:07:26,145 --> 01:07:27,836
And you've got
to accept them, anyway.

1344
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:29,252
-Part of the sport, isn't it?
-That's right.

1345
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:31,530
It's a fast, dangerous sport,

1346
01:07:31,564 --> 01:07:32,979

BENNET: You know, they knock themselves so much,

1348
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:36,569
that in the end,
the old body's going to say,

1349

"Whoo,

1350
01:07:41,678 --> 01:07:43,542
McGREGOR: The 500s
are in trouble,

1351
01:07:43,576 --> 01:07:45,302
as much as
10 miles an hour slower

1352
01:07:45,337 --> 01:07:47,339
than the four-strokes
in a straight line.

1353
01:07:47,373 --> 01:07:49,686
They can't hope to match the raw power of the bigger bikes.

-It goes in there, then...
-Yeah.

-That's how that fits.
-Yeah, that's right. Yeah.

McGREGOR: However,
wind tunnel tests

1357
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:58,350
carried out
by Red Bull Yamaha

1358
01:07:58,384 --> 01:08:00,110
indicate that there's
more speed to come

1359
01:08:00,145 --> 01:08:01,767
from better aerodynamics,

1360
01:08:01,801 --> 01:08:03,493

as 10 miles per hour.

just three weeks away

01:08:08,498 --> 01:08:10,776

laid up in hospital,

1364
01:08:10,810 --> 01:08:12,571
it's down to John Hopkins
to find out

1365
01:08:12,605 --> 01:08:15,574
how the new design
performs on the track.

1366
01:08:15,608 --> 01:08:19,025
That looks like it'll turn
a little more into the corner.

1367
01:08:19,923 --> 01:08:21,166
It definitely leans harder.

-Okay. Mmm.
-Faster.

1369
01:08:23,513 --> 01:08:24,652
With the standard fairing,

1370
01:08:24,686 --> 01:08:26,654
there's quite a lot of lift
at the front.

1371

Uh-huh.

good enough to cut it,

so wasn't interested.

put your hand out and touch him

1390

CROSSMAN: I was talking
to one of his mechanics.

1394
01:09:29,889 --> 01:09:31,753
Next thing, you know,
we heard the bike give out

1395
01:09:31,788 --> 01:09:33,617
and then we saw
dust in the air,

1396
01:09:33,652 --> 01:09:36,517
and usually
John gets right up.

1397
01:09:36,551 --> 01:09:38,001
But we didn't
see him get up.

1398
01:09:40,072 --> 01:09:41,556
I jumped on the scooter

1399
01:09:41,591 --> 01:09:43,558
and everyone jumped in the van, so I was a little behind.

01:09:43,593 --> 01:09:45,077
I was a little nervous.

for a good lap

1402
01:09:49,288 --> 01:09:50,634
and everything
was going good.

1403
01:09:50,669 --> 01:09:52,326
Out of the sharp one,
I tried to get on it

1404
01:09:53,706 --> 01:09:56,675
and it just came out, flicked,
flicked me back.

it flicked me so fast

01:09:57,986 --> 01:09:59,540
I didn't even know
what happened.

1407
01:09:59,574 --> 01:10:01,783
Next thing I know,
I'm up in the air

1408
01:10:01,818 --> 01:10:03,613
going straight down
towards my head.

1409
01:10:04,372 --> 01:10:06,236
And I landed on my head

1410
01:10:06,271 --> 01:10:07,479
and skidded around
a little bit...

1411
01:10:09,343 --> 01:10:14,002
and then was pretty dizzy,
had to lay down
for about 10 seconds.

at that speed,

At Suzuka, he will have

by an adjustment
by improving something,

1451
01:12:38,664 --> 01:12:41,771
by finding a better tire
or more horsepower,

1452

to the next level

01:14:16,555 --> 01:14:18,971
You get this kind of glow
around you that

1496
01:14:19,006 --> 01:14:21,284
you think that
you're never gonna be hurt.

1497
01:14:21,318 --> 01:14:22,837
And I used to spend
half my time

1498
01:14:22,872 --> 01:14:25,253
trying to say
I'm not really that.

1499
01:14:25,288 --> 01:14:29,775
Sometimes, your press
and what people say to you
gets overwhelming.

1500
01:14:29,810 --> 01:14:31,984
You just get to believe

1501
01:14:32,019 --> 01:14:34,504
that you can just make
that thing stick,

1502
01:14:34,539 --> 01:14:36,195
and you can make it slide

1503
01:14:36,230 --> 01:14:37,473
and you can make
all these things happen

1504
01:14:37,507 --> 01:14:38,404
any time you want.

1505
01:14:39,302 --> 01:14:40,545
And sometimes you can't.

1506
01:14:40,579 --> 01:14:43,375
You've got to constantly
remind yourself

1507
01:14:43,409 --> 01:14:44,756
that you are human,

1508
01:14:44,790 --> 01:14:47,103
because, you know, God,
"I just messed up a little bit

1509
01:14:47,137 --> 01:14:49,139
"and didn't quite do it."

1510
01:14:49,174 --> 01:14:53,385
You know,
Wayne's accident was
really nothing spectacular.

1511
01:14:56,561 --> 01:14:58,045
RAINEY: But that day,
I was just off a little bit.

1512
01:14:58,079 --> 01:14:59,736
I was struggling,

1513
01:14:59,771 --> 01:15:01,635
but I'd been
in that situation many times.

1514
01:15:01,669 --> 01:15:02,912
So, it wasn't nothing new.

1515
01:15:02,946 --> 01:15:05,155
It was just an error
on my part.

1516
01:15:05,190 --> 01:15:06,950
I just got in
a little bit too hot,

1517
01:15:06,985 --> 01:15:08,780
carrying a little bit
too much corner speed,

1518
01:15:08,814 --> 01:15:10,333
so I had to really
bank the bike over

1519
01:15:10,367 --> 01:15:12,646
really hard
to keep it on line.

1520
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:15,580
And, uh, when I
just opened the throttle,

1521
01:15:16,477 --> 01:15:18,030
it stepped out.

1522
01:15:18,065 --> 01:15:20,136
And it was just an easy...

1523
01:15:20,170 --> 01:15:22,103
It was an easy,
uh, crash, you know.

1524
01:15:22,138 --> 01:15:24,071
I mean, 'cause,
like, it stepped out

1525
01:15:24,105 --> 01:15:25,348
and I fell off
the side of it,

1526
01:15:25,382 --> 01:15:27,523
and I was, like,
sliding with the bike

1527
01:15:27,557 --> 01:15:29,248
across the track,

1528
01:15:29,283 --> 01:15:31,285
but when I went off the track, I hit a curb

1529
01:15:31,319 --> 01:15:32,631
and it kind of
sent me up in the air,

1530
01:15:32,666 --> 01:15:35,358
and then I landed
in the gravel trap

1531
01:15:35,392 --> 01:15:37,912
and it had speed bumps
in it for the F1 cars.

1532
01:15:37,947 --> 01:15:39,120
And at that time, uh,

1533
01:15:39,155 --> 01:15:40,984
that's what we were using
in motorcycles.

1534
01:15:41,019 --> 01:15:43,124
As soon as I hit that,
it started setting me off,

1535
01:15:43,159 --> 01:15:44,954
so then I, you know,
I didn't have any control

1536
01:15:44,988 --> 01:15:47,439
over how I was landing
or where I was gonna
land and...

1538
01:15:50,787 --> 01:15:52,340
from the center
of his chest down.

1539
01:15:52,375 --> 01:15:56,310
Uh, he's being held
in a hospital near Rimini.

1540
01:15:56,344 --> 01:15:57,449
He's in stable condition

1541

You know, big incident
to get something changed.

1546
01:16:11,912 --> 01:16:13,741
Being World Champion
was the ultimate,

1547
01:16:13,776 --> 01:16:17,918
but after I won it,
it was time to do it again.

1548
01:16:17,952 --> 01:16:20,092
Looking back,
I wish I'd have stepped
back out of it

1549
01:16:20,127 --> 01:16:21,749
and said, sometimes, you know, you've got to get beat.

1550
01:16:21,784 --> 01:16:23,820
I didn't let myself
think that.

1551
01:16:23,855 --> 01:16:26,651
It was just something that,
uh, I was addicted to,

1552
01:16:26,685 --> 01:16:28,653
and it took a... You know,
it took a big accident,

uh, to take me out
of that situation.

1554
01:16:31,621 --> 01:16:33,554
SCHWANTZ: Quite a while
after the race at Misano,

1555
01:16:33,589 --> 01:16:34,866
I was in my motorhome,

1556
01:16:34,900 --> 01:16:36,833
I looked outside and there was a bunch of journalists

1557
01:16:36,868 --> 01:16:38,524
and TV cameras
and all kinds of stuff

1558
01:16:39,595 --> 01:16:40,837
sitting at the door
of my motorhome.

1559
01:16:40,872 --> 01:16:42,114
I thought, "What's going on?"

1560
01:16:42,149 --> 01:16:43,391
So I walked outside
and they said,

1561
01:16:43,426 --> 01:16:44,979
"Hey, you hear you won
the World Championship?"

1562
01:16:46,015 --> 01:16:47,603
And I said, "Do what?"

1563
01:16:47,637 --> 01:16:49,950
I said, "There's still
three races to go."

1564
01:16:49,984 --> 01:16:52,090
And that was when
they told me of his injuries,

1565
01:16:52,124 --> 01:16:54,126
and I was probably
as shocked as anybody

1566

01:40:46,488 --> 01:40:48,697
and maybe put their knee
on the ground

1987
01:40:48,732 --> 01:40:50,354
is don't do it
on the road.

1988
01:40:50,389 --> 01:40:52,080
The road is not a circuit.

1989
01:40:52,115 --> 01:40:54,496
Keep the speed down a bit
because you never know,
you know,

1990
01:40:54,531 --> 01:40:57,534
if there's a bit
of dirt or oil or whatever
on the street,

1991
01:40:57,568 --> 01:41:00,226
anything out there,
or a dog or whatever.

1992
01:41:00,261 --> 01:41:02,332
Wombat, kangaroo. [CHUCKLES]

1993
01:41:02,366 --> 01:41:03,712
Just go somewhere

1994
01:41:03,747 --> 01:41:07,268
and find a local track day
and go out and, you know,

1995
01:41:07,302 --> 01:41:08,648
do a couple
track days a year

1996
01:41:08,683 --> 01:41:11,341
and just take out
your aggression
on a racetrack,

1997
01:41:11,375 --> 01:41:14,378
where everybody's out there
doing the same thing.

1998
01:41:14,413 --> 01:41:17,140
Why risk your life
on the road?

1999
01:41:17,174 --> 01:41:19,935
Because it's more easy,
simple to go on the track

2000
01:41:19,970 --> 01:41:21,282
and be more safe.

2001
01:41:21,316 --> 01:41:27,253
Now the bike, it's possible,
you buy are fucking fast.

2002
01:41:27,288 --> 01:41:32,120
Suzuki have 150 horsepower
and Honda has 140.

2003
01:41:32,155 --> 01:41:33,156
And it's incredible.

2004
01:41:33,190 --> 01:41:35,675
I like to ride a bike
on the street.

2005
01:41:35,710 --> 01:41:39,576
I have a CBR
and I always ride,
but need to,

2006
01:41:39,610 --> 01:41:43,338
especially need to stay
every time concentrated

2007
01:41:43,373 --> 01:41:46,134
when you ride,
because it's dangerous.

2008
01:41:46,169 --> 01:41:47,791
It's dangerous,
not only you,

2009
01:41:47,825 --> 01:41:50,725
but all the fucking idiots
drive the car,

2010
01:41:51,484 --> 01:41:53,762
because they don't...

2011
01:41:55,143 --> 01:41:56,938
look at the bike.

2012
01:41:56,972 --> 01:41:58,146
Because with the car,

2013
01:41:58,181 --> 01:42:01,563
it's bigger than the bike,
so, no problem.

2014
01:42:01,598 --> 01:42:04,048
-I have a scooter...
-INTERVIEWER: Yeah.

2015
01:42:04,083 --> 01:42:07,155
-Two-fifty scooter,
big scooter. I enjoy, huh.
-[LAUGHS]

2016
01:42:07,190 --> 01:42:10,158
But, uh,
when I ride a scooter,

2017
01:42:10,193 --> 01:42:14,231
I wear always gloves
and helmet and a big jacket.

2018
01:42:14,266 --> 01:42:16,337
I think I'd find myself...

2019
01:42:18,718 --> 01:42:21,065
having some trouble
with authority

2020
01:42:21,100 --> 01:42:24,241
on a motorcycle
if I ever got
on the road, so...

2021
01:42:24,276 --> 01:42:26,485
I just choose not to.

2022
01:42:28,280 --> 01:42:32,836
But, uh, yeah,
the safety issue
plays a big, big part

2023
01:42:32,870 --> 01:42:36,150
in me choosing not to ride
on the street.

2024
01:42:36,184 --> 01:42:40,844
What would I say to guys
that want to go fast
on their own bikes? Um...

2025
01:42:40,878 --> 01:42:43,087
"Make sure
your medical insurance
is up to date."

2026
01:42:44,606 --> 01:42:45,918
INTERVIEWER:
Do you ride a bike?

2027
01:42:45,952 --> 01:42:47,920
No. It's far
too dangerous, isn't it?

2028
01:42:47,954 --> 01:42:49,818
[LAUGHING]
