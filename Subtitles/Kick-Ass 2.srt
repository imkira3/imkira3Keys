00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:50,849
<i>A handgun bullet travels
at more than 700 miles per hour.</i>

3
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:56,146
Hey, whoa. Absolutely not. No.

4
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:57,974
Mmm-mmm.

5
00:00:57,975 --> 00:01:01,985
Look, if you don't wanna do
it, you don't have to do it.

6
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:04,021
Okay. Good,
I don't wanna do it.

7
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:05,114
Fine.

8
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:10,998
Goddamn! I'm alive.

9
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,363
Oh!

10
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:15,377
Oh, that's amazing!

11
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:17,872
I know, right. So...

12
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:20,623
Hmm.

13
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:22,832
Ready to go again?

14
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:24,417
Absolutely not.

15
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:26,636
Fine.

16
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:29,839
Don't just say "fine" and
then shoot me in the chest.

17
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,590
'Cause it's not cool.

18
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:32,719
Like at all.

19
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:35,690
Okay. Jeez.

20
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:47,440
<i>I always wondered why no one
tried to be a superhero before me.</i>

21
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:51,118
<i>It turns out
somebody had. Mindy Macready.</i>

22
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:53,904
<i>After her dad died, his
old partner on the force,</i>

23
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:55,781
<i>Marcus, became her guardian.</i>

24
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:58,743
Is that a Pink Pony bag she's wearing?
Nice backpack.

25
00:01:58,744 --> 00:01:59,910
Thanks.

26
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:01,746
Steal it from a six year old?

27
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:03,918
<i>Marcus dropped
her off every day.</i>

28
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:07,220
<i>But as soon as he
was gone, so was she.</i>

29
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,547
<i>No one at school found out because
she hacked into the server</i>

30
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:13,719
<i>and gave herself the award
for perfect attendance.</i>

31
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:17,940
<i>Hit Girl and Big Daddy
had been the real deal.</i>

32
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:20,686
<i>Mindy was gonna
keep wearing the mask</i>

33
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:23,269
<i>as long as there were
criminals to take down.</i>

34
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:28,441
<i>But no matter how many
drug dealers she stopped,</i>

35
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:31,826
<i>she couldn't stop
feeling alone.</i>

36
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:35,613
<i>Me? I'd given up
being a superhero</i>

37
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:37,453
<i>because it was
way too dangerous.</i>

38
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:40,451
<i>Only problem,
I was dying of boredom.</i>

39
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:41,786
<i>Like most high school seniors,</i>

40
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:44,080
<i>I had no idea what I
wanted to do with my life.</i>

41
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:46,761
<i>Hell, I didn't know what
channel I wanted to watch.</i>

42
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,639
It's just TV, Dave, not
peace in the Middle East.

43
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:51,295
<i>My best friends Todd and Marty</i>

44
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:53,923
<i>had no clue I was the first
superhero to go public.</i>

45
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:56,095
You guys watch
<i>Spider-Man</i> last night?

46
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:57,843
Is it weird that Aunt
May gets me kinda hard?

47
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,481
Not if you're
a granny-slammer.

48
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:02,360
<i>They may wear
costumes, but it isn't Halloween.</i>

49
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:04,266
<i>They're real life superheroes,</i>

50
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:06,769
<i>and in the two years since
the first ordinary citizens</i>

51
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,521
<i>donned capes and masks,</i>

52
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:10,523
<i>the movement has
started to spread.</i>

53
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,566
<i>I became a superhero
because of Kick-Ass.</i>

54
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:13,928
<i>Yeah, you just
come home from work,</i>

55
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:16,489
<i>you grab your gear
and you go out on patrol.</i>

56
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,416
<i>Help us make the streets safe.</i>

57
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,659
<i>I inspired all those
people to get off their asses,</i>

58
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,747
<i>and now I was stuck on mine.</i>

59
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:28,296
<i>So that night after dinner, I
decided to get my old costume out.</i>

60
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,929
Sorry. Whoa! Can't you knock?

61
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,840
You know, buddy, it's perfectly
normal for you to touch yourself...

62
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:37,928
Oh, Jesus, Dad.
Get out!

63
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:42,221
<i>If! was even thinking
about a Kick-Ass sequel,</i>

64
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,931
<i>I had to get serious.</i>

65
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:47,439
Hey. Hey,
can we chat?

66
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:49,985
Please, Mindy?

67
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:53,452
Get in the cab.
Meter's running.

68
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:58,248
I wanna team up
like Batman and Robin.

69
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:01,031
Nobody wants to be Robin.

70
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:02,243
What's wrong with Robin?

71
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,660
Weren't you like
Big Daddy's Robin?

72
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,049
Robin wishes he was me.

73
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:08,038
What I'm trying to say
is we should be partners,

74
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:10,887
you and me, like the dynamic duo.

75
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:14,098
I'm in the NFL, Dave.
You play pee-wee.

76
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,134
So? Train me.

77
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:17,798
I wanna walk the walk,

78
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:20,480
and you're the closest thing
I know to a real superhero.

79
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:24,693
Aren't you tired
of being on your own?

80
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:27,942
Don't you wanna know
someone's there for you?

81
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:30,987
Someone who's got your back?

82
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:39,912
And you'll do anything I say?

83
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,204
Anything.

84
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:42,492
Hit me.

85
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,252
You're a 15-year-old girl.

86
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:47,371
What the hell?

87
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:51,468
Act like a bitch,
get slapped like a bitch.

88
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,304
Oh, goddamn.

89
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:03,844
<i>Mindy beat me like morning
wood every day for three weeks.</i>

90
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:06,859
Come on. Guard up!
Left, right, guard up!

91
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:14,396
<i>Even with my damaged nerve
endings, it hurt like hell.</i>

92
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:19,235
<i>But, in a weird way,
I kinda liked it.</i>

93
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:20,486
<i>It gave me a sense of purpose.</i>

94
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:22,457
What happened to your face?
Nothing.

95
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:24,157
<i>Like we were driving
towards something.</i>

96
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,160
Goddamn!

97
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,007
Oh! Oh, that's amazing!

98
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:33,499
<i>All the other people putting on
masks were just playing superhero.</i>

99
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,470
<i>We were training
to really do it.</i>

100
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:39,630
<i>I couldn't tell my girlfriend
Katie, or Marty and Todd.</i>

101
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:42,181
<i>But I didn't care. We
were having too much fun.</i>

102
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,981
Left, right, left!

103
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,770
<i>Our own superhero team.</i>

104
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,814
<i>It was gonna be balls.</i>

105
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:03,534
What the hell, Mom? Did you
delete the news off the DVR?

106
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:05,948
Yes. Yes,
I did, Christopher.

107
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:08,117
That was the one
with Kick-Ass.

108
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:12,329
Oh, Christopher, you've gotta stop
obsessing over this superhero.

109
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,873
He is not a superhero,
Mom, he's a murderer.

110
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,167
He blew up Dad with a
bazooka, for fuck's sake!

111
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:19,378
Your father died in a fire.

112
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,598
A fire?
What is your problem?

113
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:24,559
You! You are my problem!

114
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:28,733
I am trying to raise you
to be a normal boy!

115
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,725
That's why we moved to Long Island
after your father's accident.

116
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:36,866
A bazooka is not an accident,
you delusional bitch!

117
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,315
This conversation is over.

118
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:40,988
Great. Then I'm leaving.

119
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:44,623
Come on, Javier, be cool.

120
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:47,365
Sorry, Chris, but your mom
pays me not to be cool.

121
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:56,123
I hate you! You home-school
me like I'm a prisoner!

122
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:58,000
You threw away
my Red Mist costume.

123
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:00,801
God! I am not
the problem! You are!

124
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,432
I wish you were dead!

125
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,438
Mommy?

126
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:19,980
Don't touch that.

127
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,073
Oh, I'm sorry.
What is it?

128
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:24,952
It's a last resort. Like if all
else fails and you're about to die.

129
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:31,918
Are you not scared to die?

130
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:34,835
Are you scared you're never gonna
grow into your big boy pants?

131
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,998
I'm serious. What if Spider-Man
or Batman got killed one night?

132
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,043
It could happen.

133
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:43,177
If you're scared of dying, one thing
is certain, you are going to die.

134
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,801
My daddy was never
afraid of dying.

135
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,681
Look where that got him.

136
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:54,098
He knew he might have to make
the ultimate sacrifice one day.

137
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,725
And that's why
he made me promise

138
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:59,312
I'd never stop
defending this city.

139
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,572
Cross my heart,

140
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,239
hope to die.

141
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:10,614
Your dad was insane.
You know that, right?

142
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:17,079
You're wrong, Dave. My daddy
was the first real superhero,

143
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,876
not you or Red Mist.
It was my daddy,

144
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:24,551
and it was an honor
to serve by his side.

145
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,814
Hey, Min, how was school?

146
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,441
Super crazy.

147
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:41,103
Miss Mullins was out today,

148
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:44,314
so we had Mr. Cooper teaching
us biology, such a grump.

149
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:47,076
Oh, really? That's weird because
Principal Himoff called me yesterday.

150
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,652
You were supposed
to get an award

151
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:51,239
for perfect attendance,
but you didn't attend.

152
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:55,075
I followed you this morning. Saw
you get into a cab with some boy,

153
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:57,202
and I lost you guys
over the bridge.

154
00:08:57,203 --> 00:09:00,051
So now you wanna tell me
where you really were today?

155
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,964
I'm really sorry, Marcus.
I didn't wanna make you mad.

156
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:11,646
Cut the waterworks, Min.
You're 15, not five.

157
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:16,682
Okay.

158
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,558
Look, he asked me to cut
class and go to the mall.

159
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,896
So, yeah, yeah, I did.

160
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:24,563
This has nothing to do
with you being Hit Girl?

161
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,648
I'm not gonna
find any ninja blades

162
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,986
or throwing stars
under your bed?

163
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:32,289
No. I just wanted him
to like me. Okay?

164
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:35,949
Sweetie, skipping school's not
away to get boys to like you.

165
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,701
I'm so stupid.
Hey, hey.

166
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:42,174
You're one of the smartest little girls I know.
Let's go get some pizza.

167
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,333
What, you mean
I'm not grounded?

168
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:46,505
Well, just consider
this awarning.

169
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:51,173
Hey, you sure you wanna
give all your mom's things away?

170
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:53,343
What the hell am I supposed
to do with all her stuff?

171
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:57,181
Damn, she had
a nice pair of guns.

172
00:09:57,305 --> 00:10:00,022
Dude, she's dead!
Don't talk about her tits.

173
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:02,184
I was talking about these.

174
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:04,866
Oh, those.
Those were my dad's.

175
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:08,868
Why don't you keep them?

176
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:10,776
Are you sure?

177
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:11,902
Yeah. I mean,
they belong to you, right?

178
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:14,833
Come on, Chris.
You're your own man now.

179
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:18,171
Just be careful, all right?
Yeah.

180
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,794
Whoa!

181
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:24,581
Definitely don't
wanna keep those!

182
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,084
I'll take care of it.

183
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:36,225
You take the day off.
Later.

184
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:41,139
Hey.

185
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,355
So, are you ready for
your first field test?

186
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,019
What am I supposed
to do with these?

187
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,785
Put them on and, uh,
go fishing.

188
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:01,580
I'm the whitest pimp ever.

189
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,036
<i>That's the idea.</i>

190
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:05,080
<i>Take the next right.
Comes out on Flatbush.</i>

191
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,124
You sure I should be doing
this without my gear?

192
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,333
<i>That's the point.</i>

193
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:11,253
<i>Kick-Ass isn't a costume.
Kick-Ass is who you really are.</i>

194
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:13,088
<i>Dave Lizewski is the mask.</i>

195
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:16,435
Well, my "mask" is about to
get his teeth kicked in.

196
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:21,263
Hey, queer bait, where are you
going with those bags, man?

197
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:24,433
<i>Tell him you're on your way to fuck
his mother with a 12-inch strap on.</i>

198
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:26,184
I'm just taking a walk.

199
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:29,234
This really isn't what I do. I
usually just call the cops.

200
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,277
Who are you talking to, man?

201
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:34,443
Uh, I'm just on a call.
It was...

202
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:37,279
You know, service round
here, it sucks, man.

203
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:41,076
Now give me the bags, faggot, before
I make you suck my fat cock, huh?

204
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:42,917
Come on.

205
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,796
Okay, Okay.

206
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:17,152
<i>Can you believe I let Mindy
beat the snot out of me for weeks</i>

207
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,404
<i>just so I could get
my ass kicked again?</i>

208
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,161
<i>So much for a team.</i>

209
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:23,619
You ready to die?
You faggot!

210
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:30,874
You know, all that homophobic
shit makes you sound super gay.

211
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:02,500
Come on, man.
Come on.

212
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:07,080
If I ever catch you robbing
again, shit-burger,

213
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,789
I'm gonna go Saudi Arabia on
your ass and cut your hand off.

214
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:12,416
Promise me you're done
with your life of crime.

215
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:13,758
I promise.

216
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,725
Pants on fire.

217
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,093
What do you think? I think
you almost got me killed!

218
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:25,220
No. What do you
think of my line?

219
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,099
"Pants on fire."
I wrote a whole bunch of 'em.

220
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:30,148
Run! I'll tell them
you saved me. Go!

221
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,894
<i>Female
suspect fleeing Flatbush.</i>

222
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:35,825
<i>Under 5 feet. Masked. Armed
with nunchucks and a sword.</i>

223
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:52,664
<i>Hey, Min.</i>
Hey, Marcus. What's up?

224
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:53,874
<i>I see you answered your phone.</i>

225
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:54,918
<i>That means
you're not in school.</i>

226
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:56,383
I was,

227
00:13:56,502 --> 00:14:00,560
but I wasn't feeling so good, and so
the nurse decided to send me home.

228
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,809
Poor thing.
Well, I'm almost home.

229
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,926
I'll make soup
and we can watch Jeopardy!

230
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,928
All righty.
I'll see you soon, okay?

231
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,021
<i>All right.</i>

232
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:34,998
Shit!

233
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,365
You got my soup?

234
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:09,157
Let me take your
temperature first.

235
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,076
Oh, you're really clammy.

236
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:12,833
I'll feel better
after a nap-nap.

237
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:15,588
Close your eyes. I'm
gonna get you that soup.

238
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,677
Is that blood?

239
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,010
Damn it, Mindy.
I can't do this anymore.

240
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,051
Your father was
like a brother to me.

241
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,095
He was a great cop and a hero.

242
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:32,347
But Big Daddy? That was
not your father, okay?

243
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:35,433
That was someone who robbed
you of your childhood.

244
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,858
And this?

245
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:40,866
Hit Girl?
That's not who you are.

246
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:47,906
You are Mindy Macready and you're
just starting high school.

247
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,199
I understand that you don't
know who that person is yet,

248
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,994
but you will,
you've just gotta try.

249
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:55,203
I don't want to.

250
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,462
You don't know what you want.

251
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:59,298
You can't. You're not
an adult, not yet.

252
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:03,213
Yeah, well, I've done more in my 15 years
than most adults have in their lifetime.

253
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,339
That note that
your father gave you,

254
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,134
the one that you were supposed to
open if anything ever happened.

255
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:11,094
What did it say?

256
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,220
That you would take care of me.

257
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,639
And that you were supposed
to listen to me, right?

258
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,849
Well, listen up.

259
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:18,602
I want you in school. I want you
to stop talking to that boy.

260
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:20,061
And I want you to promise me

261
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,696
that this is never
gonna happen again.

262
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:37,626
Cross my heart,

263
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:39,714
hope to die.

264
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:43,337
Good.

265
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,434
<i>Mindy!</i>

266
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:00,560
What the hell?

267
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,520
First you almost get me
killed, then you stand me up.

268
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,688
Dave, I'm sorry.

269
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,279
I mean, I...
You are?

270
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:07,236
I am.

271
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,284
For everything.

272
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:12,452
Oh, okay, great.

273
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:16,663
I mean, "apologetic" isn't a
word I'd use to describe you.

274
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,162
How many times do
I have to say it?

275
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:21,382
Look, let's get out of here.

276
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,959
You gotta ease up. I think
I might have broken a rib.

277
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,466
Dave, I'm done.

278
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:27,128
With training?

279
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,517
With everything.

280
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,850
Wait, you mean everything?

281
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:37,141
You can't.
You're Hit Girl.

282
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,516
We were gonna start a team,
you can't just quit.

283
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:41,356
This is who you are.

284
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:42,651
Not anymore, Dave.

285
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:47,315
I'm sorry, but it's over.
I'm done.

286
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:48,650
She just broke up with him?

287
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:49,818
Just leave me alone.

288
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:51,990
Will you stop apologizing?

289
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:56,241
I don't know what's worse, that
you're fucking a 9th-grader

290
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:57,826
or that you just got dumped by one.
Whoa, whoa!

291
00:17:57,827 --> 00:17:58,994
Pedophile freak.

292
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:00,120
It's not like that.

293
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:01,746
Then what is it like?
Please, tell me.

294
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,833
I can't. It's to do with the
Kick-Ass thing.

295
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:07,711
I've got a secret for you.
You remember Malik?

296
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:10,088
Dude who volunteers
at your needle exchange?

297
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:13,054
His baton is so much
bigger than Kick-Ass'.

298
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:14,931
No.
Yeah.

299
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:17,858
And by "baton," I mean penis.

300
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,853
Yeah, I got that. Thanks.

301
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:22,692
Fifteen gets you 20, pervert.

302
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:26,233
A freshman, Dave?
You old, salty dog.

303
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:29,743
What's the problem? Grass on
the field, play ball. Right?

304
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:31,901
No, Todd.

305
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,237
<i>Chris, your tutor's here.</i>

306
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:35,037
Chris!

307
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:37,210
Chris, your...

308
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:40,547
Holy shit.
What the hell is that?

309
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:43,211
My destiny.

310
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:46,380
Chris, just because your mom liked
to get a little freaky now.

311
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,543
I know what my role
is in this, Javier.

312
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:51,890
My dad was a crime boss,
so it just makes sense.

313
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:55,467
I'm a supervillain.
It's evolution.

314
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:56,718
Come on, come on.

315
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:58,887
Just put those things down
before you hurt somebody, Chris.

316
00:18:58,888 --> 00:18:59,931
That's not my name.

317
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,732
Okay, okay.
Uh, Red Mist...

318
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:05,685
Red Mist was my superhero name.

319
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,359
Henceforth I'll be known as

320
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,410
The Motherfucker.

321
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:13,568
<i>After Mindy quit,</i>

322
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:16,748
<i>I decided to stop hitting the heavy
bag and start hitting the streets.</i>

323
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:19,074
Hey, Kick-Ass,
welcome back!

324
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:20,202
Yeah!
Whoo!

325
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,077
You're the best, man!

326
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:25,541
<i>Only problem,
I was still on my own.</i>

327
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:28,249
<i>So I went online and found
a physics professor</i>

328
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,335
<i>calling himself
"Dr. Gravity."</i>

329
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:33,546
<i>Sure, he wasn't Hit Girl,
but I had to start somewhere.</i>

330
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:36,132
This is the zero G device
that I invented.

331
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:38,435
Can levitate
any object up to a ton.

332
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:39,726
For real?

333
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:43,139
Hell, no, man. This is a
baseball bat wrapped in tinfoil.

334
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,730
But it fooled you.

335
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,772
Hey, could I get a Diet
Mountain Dew, please?

336
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,436
I'm not even
a physics professor.

337
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:50,027
Just a copywriter
for an ad agency.

338
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:52,190
But that's why
I love this stuff.

339
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,326
You can be anyone you want!

340
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:56,903
You done many
team-ups before?

341
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:59,372
Kind of. Yeah.
No, not really.

342
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,616
I was getting kinda nervous about
being on my own, you know?

343
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:04,631
Yeah, me, too. I never
even been in a fight.

344
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:08,583
Well, hopefully
you won't have to.

345
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:12,089
I friended a guy talking about forming
a team, if you're interested.

346
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,878
I don't know how serious he is,

347
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,380
but his picture
was pretty hard core.

348
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:18,430
Are you kidding me?
That's why I contacted you.

349
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:21,094
I didn't wanna freak you out
by bringing it up too soon.

350
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:23,598
I'll show you his profile
after I hit the men's room.

351
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:28,017
Your Uncle Ralph's not
gonna be happy about this, Chris.

352
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,185
That's not my name.

353
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,658
I'm not calling
you that, forget it.

354
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:32,897
Javier, you worked for my dad.

355
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,984
Then you worked for my mom.
Now you work for me.

356
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:38,702
I'm probably the richest kid
in New York City.

357
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:40,280
But if you don't like that,

358
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:43,211
find yourself another
motherfucking job, okay?

359
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:45,829
Yo, Kick-Ass!

360
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,381
Man, am I glad to see you.

361
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,206
<i>Is there anything
I can do to help, sir?</i>

362
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:52,876
Yeah. I was hoping you can help
me get a million hits on YouTube.

363
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:00,933
Come on. Come on.

364
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:20,071
Run, Kick-Ass, run!

365
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,868
Jersey Shore motherfucker!

366
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:28,661
Hey, what, you not
interested in a fair fight?

367
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:34,501
That is no fair fight. Team meeting tomorrow.
I'll e-mail you the address.

368
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,973
Beware Dr. Gravity!

369
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:41,174
<i>You had to admire
the Doctor's enthusiasm.</i>

370
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:42,646
<i>I couldn't wait
to meet his friends.</i>

371
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,893
Hands in the air, Spring Roll.

372
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:55,271
Empty the register and
don't do anything stupid.

373
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:58,535
Come on! Hey, where are
your security cameras?

374
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,780
We don't have them. Too expensive.
Seriously?

375
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:03,537
What the fuck? How's this gonna go viral?
You want to be filmed?

376
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:05,204
Shut up and just
get on the ground!

377
00:22:05,366 --> 00:22:08,747
And you'd better tell people
The Motherfucker was here.

378
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,245
What's wrong with you, boy?

379
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:11,621
Get on the floor, too, Gandalf,

380
00:22:11,622 --> 00:22:13,790
or I will bust
a cap in your ass.

381
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:15,208
You're gonna bust your own face

382
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:17,043
when that gun kicks if you
don't hold it properly.

383
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:18,966
Just get on the ground!

384
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:24,311
God, will you hurry up!

385
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:26,469
I told you.

386
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:42,579
Go! Go, go, go!

387
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:44,208
Start the car! Go, go!

388
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,035
It was amazing!

389
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:51,412
I feel so alive. I know who I am.
I know why I'm here.

390
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:53,871
I'm gonna fuck this world up!

391
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:56,291
They will know The
Motherfucker's name!

392
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:59,424
You've gotta find me some bad-ass
MMA types to train me, okay?

393
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:01,754
Like a Chuck Liddell
or whoever.

394
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:03,262
Fuck, I don't care
how much it costs.

395
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:07,434
I just wanna be able to kill
Kick-Ass with my bare hands.

396
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,275
I gotta tweet about this.

397
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:34,124
All right.
Are you ready?

398
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:37,506
Um, I don't know.
Am I?

399
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:39,345
Yes, you are.
You look great.

400
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,461
And Barbara's daughter,
Brooke, is really nice.

401
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:43,796
What am I supposed
to talk to them about?

402
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:46,680
I'd rather be water-boarded
than listen to Justin Bieber.

403
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,678
You're gonna be fine.
I'm gonna be a disaster.

404
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:50,386
How do you know that?

405
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:53,105
Because it's a slumber party,
for fuck's sake.

406
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:55,146
Dollar. Jar.

407
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:02,654
You're gonna need a bigger jar.

408
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:09,826
Pretty cool, huh? This is how
the beer gets delivered.

409
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:15,038
Dude. You got a secret elevator
to your underground headquarters.

410
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:18,211
Yeah. The guy I told
you about owns this place.

411
00:24:18,332 --> 00:24:20,166
It's like
a real-life bat-cave.

412
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:21,674
I know, right.
Oh, yeah.

413
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,768
This is the single greatest
thing I've ever seen.

414
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:35,067
Welcome to Justice Forever.

415
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:43,531
Hi, Detective Williams.
This must be Mindy.

416
00:24:43,691 --> 00:24:44,948
It is. Hi, Brooke.

417
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:48,282
You girls have fun and I'll pick
you up in the morning, okay?

418
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:49,737
I'll be the one
with the slit wrists.

419
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:52,372
No, you're gonna be the one
that gets the awesome manicure.

420
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:54,869
I am?
Mmm-hmm. Oh, yeah.

421
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:57,537
Say "hey" to Mindy, ladies.

422
00:24:57,538 --> 00:24:58,581
Hey.

423
00:24:58,706 --> 00:24:59,831
I know you.

424
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:02,542
You're that freshman who took a ride
on Dave Lizewski's disco stick.

425
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:03,751
I did not ride his...

426
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,753
If you just blew him, you're
totes a virgin, right?

427
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,296
She didn't blow him,
look at her.

428
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:09,215
Then what? Rim job?
Hand job? Fingerbang?

429
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:11,553
Sweet-Ryan-Seacrest, you at
least kissed him, right?

430
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,055
Totes.

431
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,850
You've never kissed
a boy, have you?

432
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:18,725
Oh, my God,
that is so adorable.

433
00:25:18,726 --> 00:25:19,851
Maybe she's a dyke.

434
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:22,145
Maybe I'll jam
my foot up your snatch.

435
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:24,439
Oh, she's super bitchy,
I likes.

436
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,441
Then what's
the big deal anyway?

437
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:28,943
What could be so great about gagging
on some douche-bag's tongue?

438
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,665
It's pretty fucking great.

439
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:33,793
You know how you feel when you
watch that video by Union J?

440
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:36,411
Holy shit, you don't know?

441
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,670
This will change your life.

442
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:42,749
<i>Don't ever say you're lonely
Just lay your problems on me</i>

443
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:45,430
<i>And I'll be waiting
there for you</i>

444
00:25:46,003 --> 00:25:49,100
You guys love this shit more than
fanboys love Stan Lee, don't you?

445
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,715
Who's Stan Lee?

446
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:54,097
<i>I'll carry you I'll carry you</i>

447
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,272
<i>I'll carry you</i>

448
00:25:57,097 --> 00:26:00,146
<i>So you know that I'll carry you</i>

449
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,351
<i>I'll carry you</i>

450
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:04,523
<i>I'll carry you</i>

451
00:26:06,774 --> 00:26:09,275
<i>Like you've been
running for hours</i>

452
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:10,943
<i>And can't catch your breath</i>

453
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:14,242
<i>The demons are screaming
so loud in your head</i>

454
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,949
<i>You're tired You're broken</i>

455
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:19,118
<i>You're cut and you're bruised</i>

456
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,519
<i>But nothing's too heavy
Just hold on</i>

457
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:23,498
<i>I'll carry you</i>

458
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:24,707
What the fuck was that?

459
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,381
I know, right?
I'm soaked.

460
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:28,544
That? That is
who you are, Mindy.

461
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:30,633
You may not dress
like us or talk like us,

462
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:33,093
but when it comes to boys,
we're all the same.

463
00:26:33,217 --> 00:26:36,147
Twilight. Channing Tatum.
Union J.

464
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:39,559
It's biology, bitch.
Don't fight it.

465
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:43,311
I, um...

466
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,228
I gotta go.

467
00:26:45,229 --> 00:26:47,649
But we were gonna go and get high
on bath salts at Logan's house.

468
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:49,315
Mindy, I wanna
give you a chance

469
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:52,579
that the rest of the girls
in our class would kill for.

470
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:56,372
Don't you wanna walk out the door
every day in skin-tight clothes

471
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:59,171
knowing that
everyone worships you?

472
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:02,499
Don't you wanna sneak out at
night, raise a little hell,

473
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,372
and show the world
what a strong,

474
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:07,303
independent woman
is capable of?

475
00:27:08,252 --> 00:27:09,545
Don't you wanna belong?

476
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:13,339
<i>So you know that I'll carry you</i>

477
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,590
Can I wear this to Logan's?

478
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:15,683
Yay!

479
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:17,272
It's gonna be so much fun.

480
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:22,481
So we tried the cops
and tried the newspapers,

481
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:27,528
and even set up a, you know,
athing on the Internet

482
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:30,327
for people to
help us find Tommy.

483
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:32,650
Um...

484
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:36,494
But we got nothing. We
never saw our son again.

485
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:40,539
I came up with the name
Remembering Tommy,

486
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:43,838
and, uh, we've been doing this
three nights aweek. So...

487
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:47,000
Colonel Stars and Stripes
found us online.

488
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:50,471
That's terrible, guys.
I'm real sorry.

489
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:54,180
I became Night Bitch after my sister
was murdered and found in a dumpster.

490
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:55,425
Holy shit.

491
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:57,258
Doesn't bring her back,

492
00:27:57,259 --> 00:27:59,344
but at least I'm doing
something positive about it.

493
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,433
Insect Man.
Yeah, um...

494
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:05,153
I've been bullied my whole
life for being gay,

495
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:08,197
so now I stand up
for the defenseless.

496
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:10,563
That's why I don't wear a mask.

497
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:12,149
Too much like being
back in the closet.

498
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,525
Long as your
heart's in the right place,

499
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:16,277
we don't care what you
put in your mouth.

500
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:18,413
Fist bump. Thank you.
Thank you, sir.

501
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:20,740
Well, I became Battle Guy

502
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:24,452
after my parents were mugged and
killed coming home from the opera.

503
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:26,078
Did I tell you
that sick bastard

504
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,914
maxed out their credit
cards on porno sites?

505
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:30,333
I hope we get the chance to
say hello to this guy someday

506
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:33,014
so I can personally levitate
his soul from his body.

507
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:34,765
Oh, my God. Marty?

508
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:37,597
Yeah, I knew
I recognized your voice.

509
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,887
No, I don't know what
you're talking about.

510
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:42,596
I don't know no Marty.
New guy.

511
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:45,307
Hey, asshole, it's me, Dave.

512
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:49,231
Dave? Why are you
dressed like Kick-Ass?

513
00:28:49,353 --> 00:28:51,689
Because I'm Kick-Ass.

514
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:53,022
You two know each other?

515
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:54,692
Yeah, like since we were five.

516
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:58,454
What's all this bullshit about
your parents getting killed?

517
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,124
Yeesh, language.
What?

518
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:02,919
Battle Guy, care to
update your résumé?

519
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:05,128
Uh...

520
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,370
I'm trying to figure out
how to explain this

521
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:10,170
without sounding like
a complete idiot right now.

522
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,583
Yeah, I'm not sure
that's possible, Batman.

523
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:13,628
I'm not, either.

524
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:15,628
Um...

525
00:29:15,629 --> 00:29:17,254
Okay. Well, when I found
you guys online,

526
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:19,924
you were all swapping these
awesome origin stories.

527
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:22,051
I mean, Colonel, you're
ex-Mafia, for Christ's sake.

528
00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:25,101
Yo. Don't take
the Lord's name in vain.

529
00:29:25,222 --> 00:29:26,812
I'm sorry.

530
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:30,017
I didn't think you'd
let me join the team

531
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:32,106
unless I had a good story, too.

532
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:37,037
All right, we'll let you off the
hook this time, Battle Guy.

533
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:40,030
Wanna see something cool?
Yeah.

534
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:42,790
I thought this could
be our meeting room.

535
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:45,251
Whoa, this is so cool.

536
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:47,743
Now this little renovation
was totally clandestine,

537
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:49,963
which means nobody knew about it.

538
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:54,256
Now, I know it's not much, but
this is just the beginning.

539
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:56,210
Together we can make
a real difference.

540
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:57,303
Whoa!

541
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,172
If you'd consider it,
Kick-Ass,

542
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:01,929
we'd be honored
to have you join us.

543
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:07,227
Hell, yeah!

544
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:09,977
That's what I like to hear.

545
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,893
Right, time for initiation.

546
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:14,235
Turn around and I'll unzip you.

547
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:16,447
I'm sorry, what?

548
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:18,649
Just joking. Let's get
down to business.

549
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,371
Gotcha.

550
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,611
There you are.

551
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:25,626
We saved you a seat in the
caf, but you never showed.

552
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:28,326
I usually head over to the
Olive Garden to carb load.

553
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:31,245
I haven't had white sugar
since my first birthday.

554
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:32,539
Do we need a thintervention?

555
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:36,010
Come on, best way to tighten up
a tummy is varsity dance team.

556
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:38,380
The sign-up sheet
just went up.

557
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,424
It's still blowing
my mind. Kick-Ass.

558
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:44,592
It's like finding out
your best friend's

559
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:45,926
always been Will Smith,
you know?

560
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:49,646
Hi, guys. What are you
talking about?

561
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:51,105
Nothing.

562
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:53,942
Nothing?
Yeah, Todd, nothing.

563
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:57,108
All right.
See you around, guys.

564
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:59,029
Todd, wait.

565
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:02,866
Ow, watch it.
Watch me end your life.

566
00:31:03,028 --> 00:31:04,278
Come on. Forget it.

567
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:06,572
Just one of the dickheads that
follows The Motherfucker on Twitter.

568
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:07,740
Who?

569
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:08,949
The Motherfucker.
He's some guy

570
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,576
claiming to be the world's
first supervillain.

571
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:12,369
He's got 1,000
followers already.

572
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,537
What an asshole.

573
00:31:15,165 --> 00:31:16,672
Get some!
Uh-huh! Yeah!

574
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:18,631
You got this, Motherfucker!

575
00:31:18,752 --> 00:31:20,461
You really think
he's got a shot?

576
00:31:20,462 --> 00:31:22,134
I wouldn't take
his money if I didn't.

577
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:23,964
MMA is like chess.

578
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:27,263
It's all about the moves. And
your boy really knows his stuff.

579
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:31,430
Time to die, asshole.

580
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:36,188
You all right?
I'm cool. Ow!

581
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,485
Good job.
Nice jab, buddy.

582
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:42,026
Come on, stay loose, baby.
Walk it off, walk it off.

583
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:44,819
- Oh!
- Shit!

584
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,207
Oh, you broke my leg!

585
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:48,531
- Come on. Do something.
- Let's take a break.

586
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:49,990
Yeah, yeah, let's
take a break, guys. Come on.

587
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,249
Street rules, bitch!

588
00:31:55,372 --> 00:31:57,424
Chuck! Get this girl off me!

589
00:31:57,874 --> 00:31:59,708
Hey, what are you doing?
What are you doing, man?

590
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,418
You all right, Chris?
You all right, buddy?

591
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:03,212
Get off me!
I was winning.

592
00:32:03,213 --> 00:32:04,720
No, you were crying.

593
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:09,310
You know what? Screw this.
My super power

594
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:12,179
is that I'm rich as shit.

595
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,901
Hey, you wanna
work for me, huh?

596
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:16,770
You wanna beat
people up for me?

597
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:18,692
Sure.
All right!

598
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:20,563
Let's get you
a mask and a costume,

599
00:32:20,564 --> 00:32:23,862
and we will call you
Black Death.

600
00:32:23,984 --> 00:32:27,246
Whoa, whoa, you don't think that's
just a little bit incredibly racist?

601
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:28,571
I don't give a shit.

602
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:30,114
I want you to put the word out

603
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:31,866
that I'm willing
to pay top dollar

604
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:33,159
for every hired hitter in town.

605
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,368
Come on, come on.
Just talk about it first.

606
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:35,461
Money talks.

607
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:37,872
You wanted me to be my own man.

608
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:39,344
This is what it looks like.

609
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:42,877
All right, all right, I'll
make some calls. Yes!

610
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:45,677
Anybody else wanna
be a supervillain?

611
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:48,340
Promise I pay better than
Chuck-little-dick-Liddell.

612
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,009
What did you call me?
No, no, man.

613
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:52,346
He took a hit to the head.
Doesn't know what he's saying.

614
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:55,776
I've been studying
privately with Coach Podell.

615
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:59,687
And by studying, I mean my mom
paid her off to make me varsity.

616
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:03,442
So, if you're half decent, I'll
make sure she puts you on the team.

617
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:05,191
At least as an alternate.

618
00:33:05,192 --> 00:33:06,829
You'd do that for me?

619
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:09,240
Besties stick together.

620
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:12,455
If Brooke wants a pet,
she should just get a dog.

621
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:14,828
She's just trying to recreate
Mindy in her own image.

622
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:16,995
All right, ladies, have a seat.
Let's get started.

623
00:33:56,326 --> 00:33:57,880
Mindy Macready?

624
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:05,298
Chill. As long as you don't
fall on your face, you're in.

625
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:07,004
Go.

626
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:22,142
Four attackers.

627
00:34:23,937 --> 00:34:25,657
No escape.

628
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:20,284
Oh, my God. You
could totally make captain.

629
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:22,202
That was so much
better than Brooke's.

630
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:23,662
Oh, my God.

631
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:26,082
Brooke doesn't stand a
chance for captain after that.

632
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:28,709
<i>A bunch of people
with made-up names</i>

633
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:31,128
<i>standing around
in homemade costumes,</i>

634
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:33,964
<i>searching the web
for unsolved crimes.</i>

635
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:36,599
<i>The comic book heroes
all have billion-dollar bases</i>

636
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:39,897
<i>and headquarters on the moon,
but this is the real world.</i>

637
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:42,439
...scales, like a red, white and blue.
It's awesome.

638
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,230
What's that?
Brick.

639
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:45,484
Right.

640
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:49,155
What do you think?
I think it does the job.

641
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:51,107
<i>People should get
what they deserve.</i>

642
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:53,575
<i>Family living in the street
deserves a hot meal.</i>

643
00:35:54,194 --> 00:35:57,237
An inebriated college girl deserves
to make it home safe at night.

644
00:35:57,238 --> 00:36:00,086
And a pervert, pedophile,

645
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:04,246
deserves a visit
from Eisenhower.

646
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:05,837
Schwantz!

647
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:07,581
Ouch.

648
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:09,208
You don't wanna hit
with your closed fist.

649
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:11,502
You might break your hand,
then you're defenseless.

650
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:15,097
You wanna hit with open palm and pivot.
Open palm and pivot.

651
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:16,300
Grab the back...

652
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:19,142
<i>I never made varsity football</i>

653
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,261
<i>or got cast in the school play.</i>

654
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:23,517
<i>Hell, I never even
made honor roll.</i>

655
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,850
Knock out, bitch!

656
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:29,609
<i>But if I had, I gotta believe it
would've felt a lot like this.</i>

657
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:32,945
When the cops can no
longer protect and serve,

658
00:36:33,066 --> 00:36:35,818
be warned, mugger,
heads up, perv.

659
00:36:35,819 --> 00:36:38,287
We got the strength,
we got the nerve

660
00:36:38,405 --> 00:36:40,989
to give those in need
what they deserve!

661
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,996
Justice Forever!

662
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:46,662
<i>We were in the ultimate clique.</i>

663
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:48,831
<i>It didn't matter that
no one else knew.</i>

664
00:36:48,832 --> 00:36:51,797
<i>We knew.
And we felt like rock stars.</i>

665
00:36:52,669 --> 00:36:55,129
Good night, guys.
Nice job. Battle Guy.

666
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:57,810
Night, Colonel.
Thanks for everything.

667
00:36:58,091 --> 00:37:00,262
No, son, thank you.

668
00:37:00,427 --> 00:37:03,178
You showed us that every
man can make a difference.

669
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:06,358
Without Kick-Ass,
none of us would be here.

670
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:09,987
That's from the heart. Don't
let it go to your head.

671
00:37:13,106 --> 00:37:14,198
So...

672
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:17,494
I'm not really that tired.

673
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:28,122
Mmm.

674
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:30,381
Mmm-mmm?

675
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,082
Mmm. Okay.

676
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:34,088
Let's leave the masks on.

677
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:36,378
Yeah?
Yeah.

678
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:37,553
Yeah!

679
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,645
<i>First big mission's tonight</i>

680
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,511
and it's not community service.

681
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:46,980
We're taking on
some real bad guys.

682
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,854
What, can't your
team handle it?

683
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:50,648
They're not you, Mindy.

684
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:53,562
Remembering Tommy
owns a dry fruit business.

685
00:37:53,563 --> 00:37:54,951
Night Bitch teaches ballet.

686
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:56,565
Night Bitch?

687
00:37:56,566 --> 00:37:59,330
What is she? A superhero
or a soft core porno?

688
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:01,413
Maybe a little bit of both.

689
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:04,744
Oh, God, you're plugging her?

690
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:06,788
I'm gonna vom.

691
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:08,285
You're like a ninja.

692
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:11,584
Can't you just sneak out
after Marcus goes to sleep?

693
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:14,379
You don't get it, Dave.

694
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:17,586
I made a promise to Marcus.

695
00:38:17,587 --> 00:38:20,387
So break it. You're a
superhero, remember?

696
00:38:20,507 --> 00:38:23,092
Mindy Macready's
just a disguise.

697
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:26,267
Yeah, well, I don't know what
kind of superhero Night Whore is,

698
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:29,181
but if you really think
I'd ever break my word,

699
00:38:29,182 --> 00:38:30,772
you obviously have
no idea who I am.

700
00:38:30,892 --> 00:38:33,478
I know that making dance team doesn't
make you stop being who you are.

701
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:35,687
I know Hit Girl
couldn't give a shit

702
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:37,272
about what high school
girls are into.

703
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:40,821
I know that you wouldn't go on a
date if your life depended on it.

704
00:38:40,944 --> 00:38:42,152
Go to hell, Dave.

705
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:44,075
What? You know I'm right.

706
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,412
Hey! Roid Rage.

707
00:38:47,534 --> 00:38:49,005
Me?
Yeah.

708
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:50,619
You wanna take me
on a date sometime?

709
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,707
Uh, yeah.
Sure. Um...

710
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:56,179
My name's, um, Simon.

711
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:58,756
Great, um, Simon.

712
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:00,923
It's a date.

713
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:03,507
Mindy, I'm sorry.

714
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:04,675
Is there a problem, Min?

715
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:05,719
Zero.

716
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:08,727
Good. Because
I don't like problems.

717
00:39:09,973 --> 00:39:12,182
<i>Dave, you been
sneaking out at night?</i>

718
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,350
Mrs. Neipert said

719
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,435
she thought she saw you leaving
at 2:00 in the morning.

720
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:17,938
Miss Neipert's crazy, Dad.

721
00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:20,110
She tried to teach
her dog Spanish.

722
00:39:21,818 --> 00:39:23,538
Are you on drugs?

723
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,112
Seriously?

724
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:26,287
I gotta ask.

725
00:39:26,406 --> 00:39:29,752
You're my best bud and
you're growing up so fast.

726
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:32,621
Promise me you're not
doing anything foolish?

727
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:35,258
Yeah, I promise.

728
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:37,340
Good enough for me, pal.

729
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:41,599
You're too smart to
do anything stupid.

730
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,966
Justice Forever!

731
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:48,767
I'm glad you got that out of your system.

732
00:39:50,263 --> 00:39:53,849
Oh, Todd texted me.
Again. What a loser.

733
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:57,311
Dude, how bad-ass is
Colonel Stars and Stripes?

734
00:39:57,312 --> 00:39:59,730
Yeah, I still can't believe
he's an ex-mob enforcer.

735
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:02,107
I mean, how do you go from
that to being a superhero?

736
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:03,442
He's a born-again Christian.

737
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:04,700
Shut up.
Yeah.

738
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:08,454
Let's hope he
can handle tonight.

739
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,537
I guess we're
about to find out.

740
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,429
Hey. Where's the rest
of the team?

741
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:24,379
Dr. Gravity has the flu,

742
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,715
and Remembering Tommy got
Book of Mormon tickets, so...

743
00:40:26,716 --> 00:40:28,306
That's okay.

744
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:30,260
Five of us should do.

745
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:32,847
How did you say this guy made
his money, sir? Prostitution?

746
00:40:33,056 --> 00:40:37,768
Not just girls. Kids. Ships them
in from villages back home.

747
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:39,774
Boneheads in blue
take a blind eye.

748
00:40:39,896 --> 00:40:41,855
How do you know
he's here tonight?

749
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:44,075
Because Thursday night
is poker night.

750
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:46,902
Same five low-lifes
every week.

751
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:48,612
Man with a habit
ain't hard to find.

752
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:51,377
So what's the plan?
Are we sneaking in?

753
00:40:51,491 --> 00:40:52,908
I thought we'd knock.
It's more polite.

754
00:40:52,909 --> 00:40:54,166
What?

755
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:56,832
Stay frosty, team.

756
00:40:57,372 --> 00:41:00,420
I used to eat punks
like this for breakfast.

757
00:41:02,669 --> 00:41:03,760
Jehovah's Witness!

758
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,271
I'm sorry, I just
zoned out for a second.

759
00:41:19,394 --> 00:41:22,775
Did you say that we're going
up against five gangsters?

760
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,451
And bouncer makes six.

761
00:41:28,361 --> 00:41:29,611
And three-quarters.

762
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:31,748
What the fuck do you want?

763
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:35,044
Good evening, young man. We'd
like a word with Jimmy Kim.

764
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,452
If it's not too inconvenient.

765
00:41:39,247 --> 00:41:43,755
Get the fuck out of here before I
tear your head off, you old fuck.

766
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:46,046
I'm sorry.

767
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:48,511
I think we're in trouble.

768
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:51,007
I just don't understand
why people feel the need

769
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:52,895
to use that kind of language.

770
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,141
Whoa!

771
00:41:59,142 --> 00:42:00,483
There he goes.

772
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:05,230
Oh, sweet Jesus.

773
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:09,735
Battle Guy, what did I tell you about
taking the Lord's name in vain?

774
00:42:09,736 --> 00:42:10,827
Sorry, sir.

775
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:13,371
Eisenhower, at the ready.

776
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:15,115
Insect Man, I want
you right behind me.

777
00:42:15,116 --> 00:42:17,501
Everybody else spread out,
catch the strays.

778
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:18,952
Oh.

779
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:23,010
And try to have fun,
otherwise what's the point?

780
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:27,010
Nice party.
Anybody wanna dance?

781
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:35,690
Where are you going?

782
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:43,651
Very nice.
Behind you!

783
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:48,488
Watch the birdie.

784
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:51,241
Whoo!

785
00:42:57,742 --> 00:42:58,950
Don't you move.

786
00:42:58,951 --> 00:43:00,203
Night Bitch!
Behind you!

787
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:06,258
Wait.

788
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:09,051
Look out!

789
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:18,932
Okay, I got his right arm.

790
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,270
You know, you shouldn't talk
with your mouth full.

791
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:29,856
It's very rude.
Come on.

792
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:32,616
Who the hell are you?

793
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:35,570
We're the good guys.

794
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:38,371
Oh, no, you're
the fucking dead guys.

795
00:43:40,952 --> 00:43:42,754
Eisenhower! Schwantz!

796
00:43:48,084 --> 00:43:49,840
Oh!

797
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:52,295
Ow!

798
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:53,463
Where are the girls?

799
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:55,841
Come on, man.
I've got a heart problem.

800
00:43:55,842 --> 00:43:56,933
Oh, yeah?

801
00:43:57,677 --> 00:43:58,844
No.

802
00:43:58,845 --> 00:44:00,595
Do you want me
to solve that for you?

803
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:02,518
Whoa, whoa!

804
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:05,986
Okay. The girls are
upstairs in the apartments.

805
00:44:06,102 --> 00:44:10,325
My little brother, he's on the till.
He's just a college kid.

806
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:12,202
Kick-Ass, Night Bitch.
On it.

807
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:15,330
Ralph D'Amico is
gonna end you for this.

808
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:16,832
Ow! It hurts!

809
00:44:16,946 --> 00:44:20,161
Yeah,
there's a dog on your balls.

810
00:44:22,285 --> 00:44:25,049
You want money? There's
50 grand on the table.

811
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:28,010
Please just make him stop! Please!

812
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:31,339
You think you can buy us?
Is that what you think?

813
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,631
We're not here
to steal from you.

814
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:38,763
We're here to send a message to
all the other bottom-dwellers.

815
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,095
- We're shutting you down.
<i>- Come on.</i>

816
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:44,931
There's a van waiting outside
from a battered women's shelter.

817
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:47,350
It'll take you some place safe.

818
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:49,403
Go. Go.
We really can't leave.

819
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,276
We have no money.

820
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:54,195
Battle Guy, how much
they have on the table?

821
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:56,245
Oh, it's like 50 grand.

822
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,116
You got plenty now.

823
00:44:58,237 --> 00:44:59,708
Thank you.

824
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:12,125
<i>Good job, guys.</i>

825
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:14,630
Very tidy. Very tidy.

826
00:45:14,754 --> 00:45:17,719
I can't believe you pulled
a gun on that guy.

827
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:19,549
Were you really
gonna shoot him?

828
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,472
Let you in on a little secret.

829
00:45:23,054 --> 00:45:25,805
Empty.
Don't tell the bad guys.

830
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:29,982
Pardon my language, Colonel, but
you have got some serious balls.

831
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:32,321
Certainly more than Mr. Kim.

832
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:34,823
"There's
a dog on my balls."

833
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:38,952
God damn it.

834
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:41,488
Javier!
What happened?

835
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:44,115
Some douche just posted a link
to a story about a whorehouse,

836
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:46,201
says that Kick-Ass'
team took them out.

837
00:45:46,202 --> 00:45:47,922
What the hell?
Where's my crew?

838
00:45:48,037 --> 00:45:49,287
Chris, everybody's just...

839
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:53,881
Uh, can you ladies
excuse us for a second?

840
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:55,293
Uh, no, they're my sidekicks.

841
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:56,753
They can listen to
what we have to say.

842
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:57,921
They're not
your sidekicks, Chris.

843
00:45:57,922 --> 00:46:00,256
They're prostitutes
and witnesses, come on.

844
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:02,097
All right.
Sorry, no offense.

845
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:06,012
Everybody's just too afraid of
your Uncle Ralph to take the job.

846
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:07,180
But he's in prison.

847
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:09,349
Doesn't matter.
He runs the family now.

848
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:11,604
And he wants
everybody to lay low.

849
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:13,103
But, fortunately for you,

850
00:46:13,104 --> 00:46:15,607
Big Tony doesn't know how
to lay low, so he's in.

851
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:18,068
I don't remember a Big Tony.
Is he huge? He's ironic.

852
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:21,778
<i>5 foot 4, but mean as shit.</i>

853
00:46:26,117 --> 00:46:28,797
<i>He's got such a hard-on
for killing people.</i>

854
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:32,425
He's little and he kills.
Right.

855
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,464
Call him "The Tumor."

856
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:35,750
<i>Who's next?</i>

857
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:38,962
<i>All right, we've got, uh, an
ex-Triad member looking for work.</i>

858
00:46:38,963 --> 00:46:40,932
Easy, "Genghis Carnage."
Come on.

859
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:44,718
You gotta quit with the
racist stereotypes, Chris.

860
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:46,724
Archetypes.
Keep going.

861
00:46:46,846 --> 00:46:48,930
We got, uh,
Katarina Dumbrovski.

862
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:50,140
Wait, wait. A chick?

863
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:51,307
<i>Yeah.</i>

864
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:52,851
<i>Seriously, you hired a chick?</i>

865
00:46:52,852 --> 00:46:57,526
<i>Yeah. Former KGB. She was locked up in
the Gulag until she ate her cellmate.</i>

866
00:46:57,648 --> 00:47:00,282
Okay. "Mother Russia."

867
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:03,820
Mother Russia and Motherfucker
both on the same team?

868
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:04,988
That doesn't work, Chris.

869
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:06,865
I am not asking for
suggestions, asshole.

870
00:47:06,866 --> 00:47:10,045
Just get them costumes
and get them ready!

871
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:11,661
Shit.

872
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:13,501
Javier, thank you.

873
00:47:14,123 --> 00:47:16,543
I couldn't do this without you.

874
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:20,723
You're pretty much like the
only real family I have left.

875
00:47:21,297 --> 00:47:23,800
Not a problem, man.
I got your back.

876
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:27,637
It's kinda like you're the
Alfred to my evil Bruce Wayne.

877
00:47:27,762 --> 00:47:29,434
Did you just call me
your fucking butler?

878
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,317
Yeah, is that not a compliment?

879
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:34,688
Shit. My bad.

880
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:40,315
<i>There wasn't
much action most nights.</i>

881
00:47:40,316 --> 00:47:43,828
<i>I mean, there was always a
little action with Night Bitch.</i>

882
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:49,876
<i>The reality of being a
superhero is lots of patrols.</i>

883
00:47:50,034 --> 00:47:53,332
<i>But that didn't stop people
from begging to join up.</i>

884
00:47:56,457 --> 00:48:00,467
<i>With all our new members, it seemed
kinda shitty not to ask Todd.</i>

885
00:48:02,463 --> 00:48:04,848
Stop peeking, man,
you're gonna ruin it.

886
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:07,979
Check it out.

887
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:12,555
You can't fight crime in that. Your
pants are so tight, you got frog-eye.

888
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:14,182
What the
hell's "frog-eye"?

889
00:48:14,183 --> 00:48:15,892
Male camel toe.
What?

890
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:20,402
I'm not really sure about these names, either.
"Whup-Ass," "Kick-Ass-Man."

891
00:48:21,065 --> 00:48:22,785
"Dr. Kick-Ass"?
Yeah.

892
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,913
Yeah, they all
kinda seem derivative.

893
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:27,403
Let me translate that.

894
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:30,038
You can't just copy Dave's
name, you knob-gobbler.

895
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:32,201
Okay. Um...

896
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:34,202
Uh...

897
00:48:34,203 --> 00:48:36,290
Oh, wait. Oh, I got it.

898
00:48:36,539 --> 00:48:37,749
I got it. I got it.

899
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:41,256
"Ass Kicker."

900
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,295
Seriously?

901
00:48:44,296 --> 00:48:45,630
You're such a dick, Marty.

902
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:47,257
I know this is why you guys
aren't texting me back,

903
00:48:47,258 --> 00:48:48,424
I'm not an actual idiot.

904
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:50,596
Well, you could have
fooled me, Ass-Licker.

905
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:54,055
Yeah, well, screw you guys.
Todd...

906
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:56,015
No, really.
Fuck you guys.

907
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:57,274
I'm gonna go find my own team.

908
00:48:57,393 --> 00:48:58,977
Todd. Wait. Come on.

909
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:03,815
<i>Todd was right,
we were being dicks.</i>

910
00:49:03,816 --> 00:49:05,275
<i>But the truth is,
the only person</i>

911
00:49:05,276 --> 00:49:08,159
<i>I really wanted on
the team was Mindy,</i>

912
00:49:08,571 --> 00:49:11,785
<i>but she was too busy
trying not to be a superhero.</i>

913
00:49:12,283 --> 00:49:14,122
Okay, Min, he's here.

914
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:23,472
Your first big date.
How are you feeling?

915
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:25,628
Like the first time
Big Daddy sent me into

916
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:28,310
a crack den with nothing
but a penknife.

917
00:49:29,008 --> 00:49:31,179
I've got some butterflies.

918
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:35,399
You just be yourself
and you let me be nervous.

919
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:39,225
Don't worry about me. I can
kill a man with his own finger.

920
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:42,275
A word of advice, I wouldn't
open with that.

921
00:49:46,609 --> 00:49:48,818
Thanks for letting me
finally take you out.

922
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:49,993
Well, uh,

923
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:53,334
how else was I gonna get
you to stop calling?

924
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:55,662
Thanks.
You're welcome.

925
00:50:08,881 --> 00:50:10,173
Where are we going?

926
00:50:10,174 --> 00:50:11,348
To a party.

927
00:50:11,467 --> 00:50:14,385
Why is this party in
the middle of nowhere?

928
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:17,732
Because that's where keg
parties usually are, right?

929
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:32,743
Guess we're
the first ones here.

930
00:50:32,905 --> 00:50:35,490
This isn't where you
have a party, moron.

931
00:50:35,491 --> 00:50:36,914
This is where you
dump a dead body.

932
00:50:37,076 --> 00:50:38,660
What's your problem?

933
00:50:38,661 --> 00:50:39,835
I'm sorry.

934
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:43,539
I'll stop being such a bitch.

935
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:44,918
You actually seem
like a nice guy.

936
00:50:47,086 --> 00:50:48,177
So, um...

937
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:50,755
You wanna hook up?

938
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:52,048
And a total idiot.

939
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:56,979
Simon, get back in the car.

940
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:58,812
Now!

941
00:51:08,357 --> 00:51:10,196
Yay, you made it.

942
00:51:10,359 --> 00:51:11,830
Brooke?

943
00:51:12,361 --> 00:51:15,326
This is to celebrate you.

944
00:51:16,115 --> 00:51:17,503
Celebrate?

945
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:19,621
What a total loser you are.

946
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:22,831
And we ditch losers.

947
00:51:23,872 --> 00:51:26,969
Poor Mindy.
What did you think?

948
00:51:27,418 --> 00:51:30,003
The cool kids saw
something special in you

949
00:51:30,004 --> 00:51:32,472
and invited you
to your first party

950
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:34,632
where you'd sip your first beer

951
00:51:34,633 --> 00:51:37,563
and finally suck face
for the first time?

952
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:41,102
Newsflash, you're not special.

953
00:51:43,726 --> 00:51:47,189
Fuck with the queen bee
and you're gonna get stung.

954
00:51:49,273 --> 00:51:50,945
Date ditch.

955
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,151
Party at my house!

956
00:51:53,152 --> 00:51:54,319
Pathetic.

957
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,656
Simon, you can drive us.

958
00:52:43,077 --> 00:52:44,287
Dave?

959
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:49,927
Oh, my God! Mindy? Holy shit.
What are you doing?

960
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:54,345
Just needed to see
my Robin, I guess.

961
00:52:57,383 --> 00:52:59,185
Are you okay?

962
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:01,605
Hey, hey, hey.

963
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:08,104
I don't know what to do.

964
00:53:08,352 --> 00:53:10,357
Those girls, they're...

965
00:53:11,397 --> 00:53:13,069
They're evil.

966
00:53:13,524 --> 00:53:15,983
It's just high school.
Who gives a shit?

967
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:19,496
You should be out there in the real
world making it a better place.

968
00:53:20,531 --> 00:53:21,864
Dave, I can't.

969
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:23,621
I know, you promised your dad.

970
00:53:26,412 --> 00:53:28,251
But he's not here anymore.

971
00:53:29,081 --> 00:53:31,928
This is your life.
You've gotta live it.

972
00:53:33,419 --> 00:53:36,183
How am I supposed
to face them tomorrow?

973
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:38,840
I'm so embarrassed.

974
00:53:38,841 --> 00:53:40,007
Why?

975
00:53:40,008 --> 00:53:44,481
You're smart. You're beautiful.
You're funny.

976
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:50,526
You're the strongest person I've ever met.
You can do anything.

977
00:53:50,811 --> 00:53:52,733
And you're Hit Girl.

978
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:56,399
Doesn't matter if you're
wearing a mask or makeup,

979
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,871
it's who you really are.

980
00:53:59,695 --> 00:54:02,447
So what should I do?
Cut their tongues out?

981
00:54:02,448 --> 00:54:04,031
No! Definitely not.

982
00:54:04,032 --> 00:54:05,504
I'm fucking with you.

983
00:54:08,787 --> 00:54:10,839
Just beat them
at their own game.

984
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:14,046
By being yourself.

985
00:54:22,134 --> 00:54:24,981
<i>Well, if you
really wanna be popular,</i>

986
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:29,105
consider two little words,
"sex," "tape".

987
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:48,493
Lois, you don't
need these ax wounds.

988
00:54:48,494 --> 00:54:50,997
If I can dress
like them, so can you.

989
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:55,336
It's a gift from some drug
dealer who went missing.

990
00:54:56,502 --> 00:54:58,507
Just because you dress like us,

991
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:00,557
doesn't mean you
can be like one of us.

992
00:55:00,881 --> 00:55:04,144
It doesn't matter what costume
I wear, yours or mine,

993
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:07,107
I'm a superhero.
That's who I am.

994
00:55:07,221 --> 00:55:09,263
Okay,
Captain Muffin-Muncher,

995
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:11,015
have fun playing
make-believe.

996
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:12,141
This?

997
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:13,809
This is all make-believe,
Brooke.

998
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:16,437
The reality is
you're an evil bitch

999
00:55:16,438 --> 00:55:18,823
who's just as bad as
the worst criminal scum.

1000
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:23,031
You wanna get real, Mindy?
In the real world, I win.

1001
00:55:23,195 --> 00:55:26,364
I go to an awesome college,
I marry a hot guy

1002
00:55:26,365 --> 00:55:27,573
and I make adorable

1003
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:31,038
babies for my nanny to take care
of while we vacay in Paris.

1004
00:55:31,203 --> 00:55:34,916
My life is gonna rock
and yours is gonna suck.

1005
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,211
And no matter
how slutty you dress,

1006
00:55:37,376 --> 00:55:40,962
no boy is ever gonna wanna kiss
that hole you call a mouth.

1007
00:55:40,963 --> 00:55:44,309
So why don't you spare us all the
whining and slit your wrists now?

1008
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:46,217
'Cause the only thing
that's gonna ruin my day

1009
00:55:46,218 --> 00:55:48,982
is looking at your face
one more second.

1010
00:55:49,263 --> 00:55:51,184
Told her.
Damn.

1011
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:55,110
What's that?
A ghetto cell phone?

1012
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:58,604
Gonna call for help
with a come-back? Hmm.

1013
00:55:58,605 --> 00:56:02,828
Actually, my daddy bought this
from a disgruntled DARPA employee.

1014
00:56:02,943 --> 00:56:05,956
You see, it was designed for crowd
control, but deemed too severe.

1015
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:10,081
It emits a pulse that creates
spontaneous nausea and diarrhea.

1016
00:56:10,409 --> 00:56:12,827
He called it
"the sick stick."

1017
00:56:12,828 --> 00:56:14,745
Either your daddy
got ripped off,

1018
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:17,083
or you're back in make-believe
land, sweetheart,

1019
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:19,760
because we feel fabulous.

1020
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:21,430
Not for long.

1021
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:32,105
Oh, my God!

1022
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:36,309
You get away from me.
Please, you win.

1023
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:38,943
I don't wanna win. I just want to
make the world a better place.

1024
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:56,623
Dad?

1025
00:56:56,747 --> 00:56:59,333
You home? Dad?

1026
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:03,586
Is this what you've been up to

1027
00:57:03,587 --> 00:57:05,806
while I'm out working nights
saving for your college?

1028
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:08,299
You've been dressing up
and fighting people?

1029
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:11,147
There is blood on
these stick things.

1030
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:13,888
What are you doing in my room?

1031
00:57:13,889 --> 00:57:15,848
I was looking for drugs.

1032
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:16,974
I was worried about you.

1033
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:18,225
Okay, good.
Now you can stop.

1034
00:57:18,226 --> 00:57:20,144
No. Now I'm even
more worried.

1035
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:22,271
Jesus, Dave,
drugs would have been better.

1036
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:24,023
This is deranged.

1037
00:57:24,024 --> 00:57:25,994
Whoa. Some people
do a lot worse.

1038
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:27,985
Oh, the people you hang out with?
No.

1039
00:57:27,986 --> 00:57:30,321
The people I hang out
with are superheroes.

1040
00:57:30,322 --> 00:57:32,448
There is no such thing, Dave.

1041
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:35,368
This is the real world
with real consequences.

1042
00:57:35,369 --> 00:57:36,709
When are you gonna grow up?

1043
00:57:36,828 --> 00:57:38,501
If it means
turning into you, never.

1044
00:57:38,622 --> 00:57:40,998
I don't wear the mask because
I'm ashamed of who I am.

1045
00:57:40,999 --> 00:57:42,969
Not like you.

1046
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:45,044
What's that supposed to mean?

1047
00:57:45,045 --> 00:57:47,382
If you're not at work,
you're here doing crunches.

1048
00:57:47,506 --> 00:57:49,423
Why? So you can
look like someone else?

1049
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:51,717
Maybe get a few more years
of doing nothing?

1050
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:54,011
Your life has no meaning, Dad.

1051
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:55,680
When you're gone,
who's gonna notice?

1052
00:57:55,681 --> 00:57:56,806
Where the hell are you going?

1053
00:57:56,807 --> 00:57:59,903
Oh, uh, I'm leaving. That's
what you do when you grow up.

1054
00:58:07,734 --> 00:58:10,069
Did he say why
he wanted to see me?

1055
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:12,787
When your Uncle Ralph
calls, I don't ask questions.

1056
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:18,213
Just the kid.

1057
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:22,545
Chris, just be cool
and you'll be fine.

1058
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:28,963
<i>Hey, how you doing?</i>

1059
00:58:28,964 --> 00:58:30,381
Good, Uncle Ralph.

1060
00:58:30,382 --> 00:58:34,093
Listen, Chrissy, things have been
tough all around since your dad,

1061
00:58:34,094 --> 00:58:35,221
you know.

1062
00:58:35,721 --> 00:58:39,232
Well, I been trying to get the
family back on track from in here.

1063
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:41,142
They record these things.

1064
00:58:41,143 --> 00:58:42,566
I know, it's fine.

1065
00:58:42,686 --> 00:58:45,272
The warden's a pal.
Now listen to me.

1066
00:58:45,397 --> 00:58:46,897
It's okay to have a bit of fun,

1067
00:58:46,898 --> 00:58:49,069
but you can't go hiring
a gang of heavy hitters.

1068
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:51,235
Javier should have told you.

1069
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:52,624
No, it doesn't matter.

1070
00:58:52,738 --> 00:58:56,782
Uncle Ralph, I am gonna make
Kick-Ass pay for what he did to us.

1071
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:59,827
Chrissy, you need
to forget that punk.

1072
00:58:59,828 --> 00:59:01,714
It's more important
that you stay out of this.

1073
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:05,046
You're not like me,
or your dad, you're, uh...

1074
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:07,217
Special.

1075
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:14,269
You can't tell me
what to do anymore.

1076
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:17,303
I know who I am now.

1077
00:59:17,304 --> 00:59:18,395
Oh, yeah?

1078
00:59:19,181 --> 00:59:20,890
And who's that?

1079
00:59:20,891 --> 00:59:22,278
The Motherfucker.

1080
00:59:27,689 --> 00:59:30,193
You think you're
the big bad guy, huh?

1081
00:59:31,902 --> 00:59:35,116
Let me show you what
real evil looks like.

1082
00:59:44,831 --> 00:59:46,042
<i>Hello?</i>

1083
00:59:47,042 --> 00:59:48,632
Javier, what's going on?

1084
00:59:48,752 --> 00:59:50,419
Chris, what's up?

1085
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:52,087
What are you doing
on Lou's phone, huh?

1086
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:53,964
<i>Drop yours in the toilet again?</i>

1087
00:59:53,965 --> 00:59:55,257
Everything okay?

1088
01:00:19,491 --> 01:00:22,504
Thank you for that.
I needed it.

1089
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:25,454
For what comes next.

1090
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:26,997
Don't be stupid, Chris.

1091
01:00:26,998 --> 01:00:30,292
Just get out of town for awhile.
Go to college or something.

1092
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:33,841
Why? You just taught me
everything I needed to know.

1093
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:42,805
<i>Voila!</i>

1094
01:00:42,806 --> 01:00:48,654
Presto and elegant, damn. Them
boys designed a very tasty logo.

1095
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:55,866
What's the matter, girl?
You hear something?

1096
01:00:56,903 --> 01:00:58,825
Come on, let's go see.
Come on!

1097
01:01:04,995 --> 01:01:06,751
Anybody out here?

1098
01:01:08,415 --> 01:01:10,005
I don't see anything.

1099
01:01:11,793 --> 01:01:15,004
Gonna have to stay in there until
you calm down, you lunatic.

1100
01:01:19,718 --> 01:01:21,557
I wonder what's bothering you.

1101
01:01:21,970 --> 01:01:25,019
I know. Tonight you die.

1102
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:28,309
Ladies first.

1103
01:01:28,310 --> 01:01:30,066
You will not shoot me.

1104
01:01:30,228 --> 01:01:34,903
You are superhero. You help people.
You do not hurt them.

1105
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:37,860
That's supervillain territory.

1106
01:01:37,861 --> 01:01:39,403
Or as I like to
call my little gang,

1107
01:01:39,404 --> 01:01:40,863
the Toxic Mega-Cunts.

1108
01:01:40,864 --> 01:01:42,205
Hi.

1109
01:01:48,330 --> 01:01:50,631
Yeah, like your head.

1110
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:02,845
Yay!

1111
01:02:03,428 --> 01:02:04,637
Ooh, it's gotta hurt!

1112
01:02:18,068 --> 01:02:20,571
I did my homework
on you, Colonel.

1113
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:23,656
You used to be
Sal Bertolini, didn't you?

1114
01:02:23,657 --> 01:02:27,583
Did a few jobs for my dad back in the
day, before you got "born again."

1115
01:02:27,786 --> 01:02:31,000
I used to hang with
a lot of losers.

1116
01:02:32,624 --> 01:02:36,710
Is this how you thought you'd die, Sal?
Dressed like an idiot?

1117
01:02:38,088 --> 01:02:40,255
Who are you supposed to be?

1118
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:42,096
I'm The Motherfucker!

1119
01:02:42,217 --> 01:02:45,598
And I'm here to end Kick-Ass.
Not just kill him.

1120
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:49,348
I am gonna shit on
everything that he loves.

1121
01:02:49,349 --> 01:02:52,232
Let's trash this place, guys.

1122
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:01,455
"Miranda Swedlow"?

1123
01:03:02,654 --> 01:03:06,082
Who's that, Sal? She one of
the whores on your team?

1124
01:03:20,046 --> 01:03:23,799
Night Bitch all
snuggled up to Kick-Ass.

1125
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:26,268
Looks like our boy's
got a new hot pocket.

1126
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:30,305
Want me to kill his dog?

1127
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:33,439
The dog? Jesus Christ,
I'm not that evil.

1128
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:37,275
Cut the old man's head off.

1129
01:03:37,397 --> 01:03:39,648
You guys hungry?
I'm starving. Come on.

1130
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:41,859
Pizza, can we get pizza?

1131
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:42,985
We're getting pizza.

1132
01:03:42,986 --> 01:03:45,821
Don't worry, I kill you first.

1133
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:51,128
Justice For...

1134
01:03:51,703 --> 01:03:52,828
...ever.

1135
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:55,842
<i>A Brooklyn resident was found
decapitated last night.</i>

1136
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:58,000
<i>According to Twitter,
a man claiming to be</i>

1137
01:03:58,001 --> 01:04:00,044
<i>the world's
first supervillain...</i>

1138
01:04:00,045 --> 01:04:02,844
I told you, no TV.
You're grounded, remember?

1139
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:05,595
Marcus, I know
I made you a promise,

1140
01:04:05,717 --> 01:04:07,134
but I can't keep
being someone I'm not.

1141
01:04:07,135 --> 01:04:08,974
When I see evil,
I have to stop it.

1142
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:12,310
Mindy, what you did to those girls
at school was unacceptable.

1143
01:04:12,432 --> 01:04:14,402
You could have really hurt them.
You're right, I could have,

1144
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:16,435
but instead I sent them home
with tummy-aches.

1145
01:04:16,436 --> 01:04:18,103
Boo-fucking-hoo.

1146
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:21,237
I don't get it. This obsession that
you have with revenge is not healthy.

1147
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:23,275
If you don't let me
and the police do our jobs,

1148
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:25,194
there is gonna be nothing
that I can do for you.

1149
01:04:25,195 --> 01:04:26,779
You're never gonna
have a normal life

1150
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:28,322
and you'll probably
end up like your father.

1151
01:04:28,323 --> 01:04:30,115
Marcus, they cut
a guy's head off.

1152
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:32,038
Who else is going to stop them?

1153
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:34,212
Kick-Ass? You?

1154
01:04:34,746 --> 01:04:37,427
You go to your room
and do your homework.

1155
01:04:47,008 --> 01:04:48,182
Now!

1156
01:04:52,347 --> 01:04:55,775
Hey, guys, we're signing a
sympathy card for the Colonel's sister.

1157
01:04:55,892 --> 01:04:59,772
You wanna go 5 bucks each so we
can send flowers from the team?

1158
01:05:01,397 --> 01:05:03,485
Did you guys see The
Motherfucker's Twitter page?

1159
01:05:03,608 --> 01:05:05,696
Who is this guy? And what's
his problem with us?

1160
01:05:05,819 --> 01:05:08,452
I don't know, but he has got
some elephant-sized balls.

1161
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:11,281
He's been bragging on the web about
what they did to the Colonel.

1162
01:05:11,282 --> 01:05:12,741
Can that be traced?

1163
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:15,506
I tried.
His IP address is masked.

1164
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:18,301
All right, here's what we're gonna do.
We're gonna organize a fight.

1165
01:05:18,414 --> 01:05:20,707
There are a lot of guys online who
said they're in if we need them.

1166
01:05:20,708 --> 01:05:22,876
Are you kidding me?
This isn't West Side Story.

1167
01:05:22,877 --> 01:05:24,837
We didn't join up
to be in a gang.

1168
01:05:24,838 --> 01:05:26,338
We did this so
we could help people.

1169
01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:28,427
Shannon's right. We need
to leave this to the cops.

1170
01:05:28,550 --> 01:05:30,134
We better start
walking in pairs.

1171
01:05:30,135 --> 01:05:34,138
Motherfucker's tweeted that the
Colonel was just the beginning.

1172
01:05:34,139 --> 01:05:36,025
Anybody seen Night Bitch?

1173
01:05:47,402 --> 01:05:49,194
Are you sure
she's on that team?

1174
01:05:49,195 --> 01:05:53,371
Stupid gash posted on her superhero
page that she's dating Kick-Ass.

1175
01:05:53,491 --> 01:05:55,543
So, yeah, I'm damn sure.

1176
01:05:59,497 --> 01:06:00,914
Hello, Night Bitch!

1177
01:06:00,915 --> 01:06:02,173
Hey.

1178
01:06:03,585 --> 01:06:06,088
Oh, she wants to take
the party upstairs.

1179
01:06:06,212 --> 01:06:08,348
We're gonna have a party.

1180
01:06:08,464 --> 01:06:10,304
She closed the door.

1181
01:06:15,388 --> 01:06:17,689
Don't worry, darling,
I'm not gonna kill you.

1182
01:06:17,807 --> 01:06:20,475
I want you to give a message
to your boyfriend.

1183
01:06:22,353 --> 01:06:23,860
Come on, wriggly.

1184
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:25,154
Let go!

1185
01:06:25,273 --> 01:06:28,037
You're done banging superheroes, baby.

1186
01:06:28,151 --> 01:06:30,861
It's time to see what
evil dick feels like.

1187
01:06:38,494 --> 01:06:39,787
Shit.

1188
01:06:40,455 --> 01:06:41,748
What's wrong?

1189
01:06:44,292 --> 01:06:46,012
What are you doing?

1190
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:49,215
Come on!

1191
01:06:51,174 --> 01:06:54,520
God, okay, I'm just...
I'm not in the mood.

1192
01:06:54,636 --> 01:06:56,771
I guess evil dick feels limp.

1193
01:06:57,347 --> 01:06:59,850
Hurt her. Bad!

1194
01:07:01,809 --> 01:07:03,518
Cops are coming.

1195
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:06,983
Leave it to Mother Russia. She
makes 10 times what we do.

1196
01:07:07,106 --> 01:07:10,819
Fifty thousand a week.
Plus expenses.

1197
01:07:12,528 --> 01:07:13,703
Hey, watch out!

1198
01:07:22,705 --> 01:07:24,046
Wow!

1199
01:07:35,218 --> 01:07:36,725
Reverse it! Reverse it!

1200
01:07:45,645 --> 01:07:46,986
Don't move! Freeze!

1201
01:07:53,194 --> 01:07:55,413
Fifty thousand.
She's worth it.

1202
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:06,081
Whoa, whoa!
Why are they backing up?

1203
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:07,921
Why is there a lawnmower
on the trunk?

1204
01:08:11,671 --> 01:08:12,845
Wow!

1205
01:08:19,762 --> 01:08:21,483
We need back-up,
eight men down.

1206
01:08:22,598 --> 01:08:24,354
I think you mean 10.

1207
01:08:34,694 --> 01:08:37,988
Let's bounce! Put the word out
I'm building an evil army.

1208
01:08:37,989 --> 01:08:40,243
All psychopaths
and ex-cons welcome.

1209
01:08:40,408 --> 01:08:43,702
I don't think you're gonna have a
problem when people hear about this.

1210
01:08:48,416 --> 01:08:50,255
They just disappeared?

1211
01:08:50,585 --> 01:08:52,085
All they have to do is
take off their masks,

1212
01:08:52,086 --> 01:08:54,588
no one's gonna recognize them once
they're back in their street clothes.

1213
01:08:54,589 --> 01:08:56,510
Your attention, please!

1214
01:08:56,632 --> 01:09:00,939
Feds traced the IP addresses for
all those other costumed freaks.

1215
01:09:01,095 --> 01:09:02,637
We got every law
enforcement agency

1216
01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:04,857
in the state working
to hit them at once!

1217
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:06,808
Why is Kick-Ass
on this list?

1218
01:09:06,809 --> 01:09:07,853
His crew does
community service.

1219
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:11,188
I don't give a shit. Anyone wearing
a mask is getting detained.

1220
01:09:11,189 --> 01:09:13,609
We're putting an end
to this tonight!

1221
01:09:14,108 --> 01:09:17,620
<i>A lot of people said the cops
were too heavy-handed that night.</i>

1222
01:09:18,363 --> 01:09:20,533
<i>But you gotta put it
into context.</i>

1223
01:09:21,616 --> 01:09:24,493
<i>The police didn't mind
our real life superhero stuff</i>

1224
01:09:24,494 --> 01:09:25,994
<i>as long as we were
picking up litter</i>

1225
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:27,716
<i>or helping old ladies
cross the street.</i>

1226
01:09:29,457 --> 01:09:31,960
<i>But suddenly it was serious.</i>

1227
01:09:32,502 --> 01:09:36,345
<i>Suddenly we represented everything
that was wrong with society.</i>

1228
01:09:36,881 --> 01:09:38,174
Freeze!

1229
01:09:38,466 --> 01:09:42,227
<i>Dad had warned me that the real
world had real consequences.</i>

1230
01:09:42,678 --> 01:09:45,977
<i>As they pulled up, he must have been
feeling pretty damn vindicated.</i>

1231
01:09:47,892 --> 01:09:51,311
Oh, shit, Dave.
What have you done?

1232
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:57,026
Police, open up.

1233
01:10:01,489 --> 01:10:02,697
Hey.

1234
01:10:02,698 --> 01:10:03,824
Hi.

1235
01:10:03,825 --> 01:10:06,873
Uh, uh, it's me, Kick-Ass.

1236
01:10:09,831 --> 01:10:11,005
Wow.

1237
01:10:12,166 --> 01:10:13,969
You're actually pretty cute
under that mask.

1238
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:18,350
I'm so sorry
about what happened.

1239
01:10:18,464 --> 01:10:19,971
Don't be.

1240
01:10:20,925 --> 01:10:22,728
It's my own fault.

1241
01:10:22,844 --> 01:10:25,595
We're gonna find these
assholes and make this right.

1242
01:10:25,596 --> 01:10:27,317
What's the point?

1243
01:10:29,392 --> 01:10:31,184
I mean,
we're really superheroes

1244
01:10:31,185 --> 01:10:32,858
about as much as
we're really dating.

1245
01:10:33,438 --> 01:10:36,118
We don't even know
each other's names.

1246
01:10:37,066 --> 01:10:39,830
I think it's time to get
back to the real world.

1247
01:10:40,653 --> 01:10:43,702
I thought we were trying
to make it a better place.

1248
01:10:45,032 --> 01:10:47,038
Then why is it worse?

1249
01:10:48,953 --> 01:10:50,958
<i>Maybe Night Bitch was right,</i>

1250
01:10:51,414 --> 01:10:53,419
<i>which means Dad was, too.</i>

1251
01:10:54,375 --> 01:10:57,389
<i>I mean, things had
gotten out of hand.</i>

1252
01:10:57,879 --> 01:11:00,380
<i>Maybe it was time for me to
stop crashing at Marty's</i>

1253
01:11:00,381 --> 01:11:02,220
<i>and start apologizing.</i>

1254
01:11:12,059 --> 01:11:13,151
Dad?

1255
01:11:13,811 --> 01:11:15,614
Whoa, whoa.
That's my dad.

1256
01:11:15,730 --> 01:11:17,314
Your dad's Kick-Ass?
What?

1257
01:11:17,315 --> 01:11:18,905
Yeah, he just gave himself up.

1258
01:11:20,651 --> 01:11:23,416
You don't understand. He's
doing this to protect me.

1259
01:11:23,571 --> 01:11:24,828
Dad!

1260
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:26,784
Dad!

1261
01:11:43,925 --> 01:11:45,515
<i>Mindy?</i>
Dave?

1262
01:11:45,635 --> 01:11:47,260
I need your help.
My dad's been arrested.

1263
01:11:47,261 --> 01:11:49,471
They think he's Kick-Ass.
Can you talk to Marcus?

1264
01:11:49,472 --> 01:11:51,275
I'm grounded.
<i>So?</i>

1265
01:11:51,432 --> 01:11:53,350
So that means
I can't get involved.

1266
01:11:53,351 --> 01:11:55,101
Look. Wait a second.
<i>I wish I could help.</i>

1267
01:11:55,102 --> 01:11:57,479
Mindy!
Are you on the phone?

1268
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:58,607
Look, I gotta go, okay?

1269
01:11:59,106 --> 01:12:00,440
<i>I'm sorry, Dave.</i>

1270
01:12:00,441 --> 01:12:01,608
Mindy, wait, wait.

1271
01:12:14,121 --> 01:12:15,877
<i>Hey, what the hell
were you thinking?</i>

1272
01:12:15,998 --> 01:12:17,999
Yeah, I could ask you
the same thing.

1273
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,126
I can't believe
you lied to them.

1274
01:12:20,127 --> 01:12:21,836
I wasn't gonna do nothing
while you went to jail.

1275
01:12:21,837 --> 01:12:25,173
I chose this. You should let
me deal with the consequences.

1276
01:12:25,174 --> 01:12:26,716
I thought you
wanted me to grow up.

1277
01:12:26,717 --> 01:12:29,970
Yeah? When you get a kid of your
own one day, you'll understand.

1278
01:12:29,971 --> 01:12:31,096
I'm gonna tell them the truth.

1279
01:12:31,097 --> 01:12:33,184
No. Hey...
It'll just make things worse.

1280
01:12:33,307 --> 01:12:35,308
Look, I spoke to my attorney.

1281
01:12:35,309 --> 01:12:37,196
He said they gotta
let me out by tomorrow.

1282
01:12:37,311 --> 01:12:39,731
No actual crime was committed.

1283
01:12:41,816 --> 01:12:44,829
There are people out there
who wanna kill Kick-Ass.

1284
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:48,280
Well, the cops are out
there looking for them,

1285
01:12:48,281 --> 01:12:52,124
so the safest place for Kick-Ass
is right here, locked away.

1286
01:12:52,243 --> 01:12:54,661
I don't know how you got
into all this shit, but

1287
01:12:54,662 --> 01:12:58,885
you gotta promise me you will never
dress up in that outfit again.

1288
01:12:59,333 --> 01:13:00,887
Do you hear me?

1289
01:13:08,342 --> 01:13:09,849
I promise.

1290
01:13:18,561 --> 01:13:21,408
This evil lair owns!

1291
01:13:21,522 --> 01:13:23,527
Do people still
say that, "own"?

1292
01:13:23,691 --> 01:13:25,567
Yeah, of course.

1293
01:13:25,568 --> 01:13:27,703
Your shark.
Something's wrong.

1294
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:29,362
Think you used
the wrong kind of water.

1295
01:13:29,363 --> 01:13:30,537
What the hell, Eyal?

1296
01:13:30,698 --> 01:13:33,074
It's fine, Chris. They're supposed
to lie at the bottom of the tank.

1297
01:13:33,075 --> 01:13:34,951
It's just their way of,
how you say,

1298
01:13:34,952 --> 01:13:36,244
settling into
their environment.

1299
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:38,163
Don't screw me on this, okay?

1300
01:13:38,164 --> 01:13:39,372
You said we'd be
ready in two days,

1301
01:13:39,373 --> 01:13:40,749
we don't even have
a men's room yet.

1302
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:42,083
Don't worry.

1303
01:13:42,084 --> 01:13:44,044
What's with the bags of shit?

1304
01:13:44,045 --> 01:13:45,884
It's fertilizer for the bombs.

1305
01:13:46,005 --> 01:13:49,424
You're not a supervillain if you don't
have a plan to destroy the city.

1306
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:51,926
It will not work.
You need a chemical kind.

1307
01:13:51,927 --> 01:13:55,274
Do I have to do everything myself?
Just fix it!

1308
01:13:55,389 --> 01:13:59,233
You must relax. Everything
is going as planned.

1309
01:13:59,393 --> 01:14:01,861
Mmm, no. No.
Except it's not, okay?

1310
01:14:02,229 --> 01:14:05,023
That sad sack
is not Kick-Ass.

1311
01:14:05,024 --> 01:14:07,525
I've seen Kick-Ass,
he's like my age.

1312
01:14:07,526 --> 01:14:09,527
Guy's old enough
to be his father.

1313
01:14:09,528 --> 01:14:10,916
No shit, right.

1314
01:14:11,572 --> 01:14:13,957
I'm sorry, who are you?

1315
01:14:14,075 --> 01:14:17,254
I, uh, volunteered for your
evil army, like the others.

1316
01:14:17,370 --> 01:14:20,798
Right. I appreciate that.
Thanks for joining the cause.

1317
01:14:20,915 --> 01:14:24,427
This is the VIP area
for the core group.

1318
01:14:24,543 --> 01:14:27,295
I just thought it was
funny you said that.

1319
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:28,880
Because he is
Kick-Ass' father.

1320
01:14:28,881 --> 01:14:30,006
Who?

1321
01:14:30,007 --> 01:14:32,095
Mr. Lizewski.
He's Kick-Ass' dad.

1322
01:14:32,885 --> 01:14:35,139
Shut up!

1323
01:14:35,388 --> 01:14:38,139
Yeah. You're not
gonna tell anyone, are you?

1324
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:39,481
No.

1325
01:14:39,892 --> 01:14:42,102
But you, my friend,
have just earned

1326
01:14:42,103 --> 01:14:44,689
life-time access
to my VIP area.

1327
01:14:44,897 --> 01:14:46,731
Go take a little seat.

1328
01:14:46,732 --> 01:14:48,066
Hey, get the kid a Frappuccino,

1329
01:14:48,067 --> 01:14:50,617
then put his little
punk ass back to work.

1330
01:14:56,242 --> 01:14:57,452
Okay.

1331
01:14:58,285 --> 01:14:59,626
Come on.

1332
01:15:12,258 --> 01:15:13,842
Can I help you?

1333
01:15:13,843 --> 01:15:16,975
The Motherfucker wants us
to take a picture with you.

1334
01:15:17,763 --> 01:15:19,931
It helps that my dad
is a really good lawyer.

1335
01:15:19,932 --> 01:15:21,558
Because I
don't think my beautiful ass

1336
01:15:21,559 --> 01:15:23,646
would last too long in prison.

1337
01:15:24,061 --> 01:15:27,774
Whoa, that's weird. Chris D'Amico
just texted me a picture.

1338
01:15:27,898 --> 01:15:30,947
Red Mist? Whatever
happened to that guy?

1339
01:15:37,658 --> 01:15:39,129
What is it?

1340
01:15:39,493 --> 01:15:40,620
Dude, what's wrong?

1341
01:15:44,415 --> 01:15:46,087
What is it?

1342
01:16:00,931 --> 01:16:03,696
<i>The next few days
passed in a fog.</i>

1343
01:16:05,603 --> 01:16:08,949
<i>It didn't matter that I told
the police about Chris,</i>

1344
01:16:09,273 --> 01:16:11,278
<i>they couldn't find him.</i>

1345
01:16:12,193 --> 01:16:14,873
<i>The cops did show up
at Dad's funeral,</i>

1346
01:16:15,279 --> 01:16:16,529
<i>not out of respect,</i>

1347
01:16:16,530 --> 01:16:19,793
<i>but because they were scared
something would happen.</i>

1348
01:16:20,493 --> 01:16:22,702
<i>My dad was a decent man.</i>

1349
01:16:22,703 --> 01:16:25,717
<i>All he ever did was try
and give me a good life,</i>

1350
01:16:26,707 --> 01:16:29,044
<i>and I told him no one would
notice when he was gone.</i>

1351
01:16:30,127 --> 01:16:31,883
I love you, pal.

1352
01:16:32,546 --> 01:16:34,801
I love you, too, Dad.

1353
01:16:41,639 --> 01:16:43,139
You guys came.

1354
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:46,984
We'd love to help you track down
this Chris D'Amico d-bag, but

1355
01:16:47,478 --> 01:16:49,479
we just got out on parole.

1356
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:50,903
No, that's fine.

1357
01:16:51,482 --> 01:16:53,566
I'm not looking for revenge.

1358
01:16:53,567 --> 01:16:57,079
Last thing I promised my dad was
that I was gonna give this up.

1359
01:16:57,404 --> 01:16:59,739
That's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

1360
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:01,496
But you started this.

1361
01:17:02,368 --> 01:17:03,921
Now I'm ending it.

1362
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:17,429
Dave, I'm so sorry. Do you
hate me for not helping?

1363
01:17:17,550 --> 01:17:19,555
No, not even a little bit.

1364
01:17:19,927 --> 01:17:22,857
You were right.
You gave it up.

1365
01:17:24,014 --> 01:17:27,775
If I had, too, my dad
would still be alive.

1366
01:17:29,937 --> 01:17:32,618
The only person
I blame is myself.

1367
01:17:46,370 --> 01:17:48,043
Let's do this!

1368
01:17:50,833 --> 01:17:51,877
Get down!

1369
01:17:56,422 --> 01:17:57,810
Mindy!

1370
01:18:00,050 --> 01:18:01,217
Spread out!

1371
01:18:10,185 --> 01:18:11,277
Keep your head down!

1372
01:18:21,947 --> 01:18:23,121
Come on!

1373
01:18:26,285 --> 01:18:27,459
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1374
01:18:28,954 --> 01:18:30,295
Get him!

1375
01:18:30,915 --> 01:18:32,967
Get that van over here!

1376
01:18:35,336 --> 01:18:36,889
Hurry up!

1377
01:18:39,298 --> 01:18:40,472
Mindy?

1378
01:18:40,633 --> 01:18:41,973
Mindy!

1379
01:18:50,935 --> 01:18:52,192
Mindy?

1380
01:18:58,317 --> 01:19:00,404
You gotta put this on.

1381
01:19:05,324 --> 01:19:06,831
I'm not gonna do it.

1382
01:19:08,661 --> 01:19:11,508
There's nothing left you can
do to hurt me.

1383
01:19:13,999 --> 01:19:15,506
You wanna bet?

1384
01:19:18,504 --> 01:19:19,547
Whoa! Whoa!

1385
01:19:21,173 --> 01:19:23,178
Game on, cocksuckers!

1386
01:19:27,513 --> 01:19:29,185
There's a girl on the roof!

1387
01:19:42,152 --> 01:19:44,157
She's still up there!

1388
01:20:00,546 --> 01:20:02,681
I think I got her!
Go check!

1389
01:20:12,850 --> 01:20:13,977
Get out there!

1390
01:20:30,075 --> 01:20:31,712
Come on!
Move your head.

1391
01:21:00,397 --> 01:21:01,904
Pull over, pube-face.

1392
01:21:05,778 --> 01:21:08,905
We know Chris D'Amico is The Motherfucker.
Where is he hiding?

1393
01:21:08,906 --> 01:21:10,031
Eat a dick.

1394
01:21:10,032 --> 01:21:11,282
You're gonna eat yours
if you don't start talking.

1395
01:21:11,283 --> 01:21:13,618
Go ahead and shoot me,
you little bitch.

1396
01:21:13,619 --> 01:21:16,205
There's nothing you can do that
would make me talk.

1397
01:21:16,872 --> 01:21:20,882
Look, hold on. I can't do this right now.
It's my dad's funeral.

1398
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:23,963
Dave, your father loved you.

1399
01:21:26,173 --> 01:21:30,479
Just like my daddy loved me. And
I know it hurts, but maybe,

1400
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:34,565
maybe that's the real meaning
of being a superhero.

1401
01:21:34,807 --> 01:21:38,437
Is taking that pain and turning
it into something good.

1402
01:21:39,478 --> 01:21:40,771
Something right.

1403
01:21:41,939 --> 01:21:43,991
Remember what you told me?

1404
01:21:44,483 --> 01:21:47,662
This is your life.
You've gotta live it.

1405
01:21:49,696 --> 01:21:53,160
Now help me find some pliers. I'm
gonna make this guy eat his own dick.

1406
01:21:54,034 --> 01:21:55,292
Seriously?

1407
01:21:58,205 --> 01:21:59,872
- Hello?
<i>- Marcus?</i>

1408
01:21:59,873 --> 01:22:01,999
Mindy. What's going on?
Are you okay?

1409
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,126
<i>I'm fine.</i>

1410
01:22:03,127 --> 01:22:05,214
We know where
The Motherfucker's hiding.

1411
01:22:05,337 --> 01:22:08,005
He's recruiting an army of supervillains
and making homemade bombs.

1412
01:22:08,006 --> 01:22:10,007
<i>Marcus, he wants to
burn the city down.</i>

1413
01:22:10,008 --> 01:22:11,217
You promised me.

1414
01:22:11,218 --> 01:22:16,521
I know you see me as this little
girl, but I'm not and I never was.

1415
01:22:17,182 --> 01:22:18,391
<i>You're right.</i>

1416
01:22:18,392 --> 01:22:20,685
<i>Daddy did take
my childhood away,</i>

1417
01:22:20,686 --> 01:22:22,520
<i>but I'm not so sure
that was a bad thing.</i>

1418
01:22:22,521 --> 01:22:24,522
Marcus, he gave me a gift,

1419
01:22:24,523 --> 01:22:26,991
a gift that I can't escape
no matter how hard I try.

1420
01:22:27,526 --> 01:22:29,902
<i>And I don't need to spend the
next four years of my life</i>

1421
01:22:29,903 --> 01:22:31,244
<i>trying to figure out who I am</i>

1422
01:22:32,364 --> 01:22:34,369
because I already know.

1423
01:22:37,161 --> 01:22:38,833
I'm Hit Girl.

1424
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:46,087
I posted the address. Do
you think they'll show?

1425
01:22:47,171 --> 01:22:48,462
Chris has an army.

1426
01:22:48,463 --> 01:22:50,089
These real life super dweebs

1427
01:22:50,090 --> 01:22:52,475
have been waiting their whole
lives for a call like this.

1428
01:23:02,936 --> 01:23:04,270
Are you okay?

1429
01:23:04,271 --> 01:23:06,358
What? Yeah, no...
I'm fine.

1430
01:23:06,857 --> 01:23:07,949
Here.

1431
01:23:08,358 --> 01:23:09,948
Take this.

1432
01:23:10,277 --> 01:23:12,780
"Last resort"
really isn't my style.

1433
01:23:13,071 --> 01:23:17,580
Dave, this isn't a comic book. Real
people are going to die tonight.

1434
01:23:17,993 --> 01:23:20,212
My daddy was prepared
for anything.

1435
01:23:20,829 --> 01:23:22,170
Are you?

1436
01:23:27,669 --> 01:23:28,880
Yeah.

1437
01:23:30,714 --> 01:23:32,055
I am.

1438
01:23:40,432 --> 01:23:42,892
They should be back by now!

1439
01:23:42,893 --> 01:23:44,018
It's definitely dead.

1440
01:23:44,019 --> 01:23:47,313
Says on the Internet you're supposed
to keep them in fresh water.

1441
01:23:47,314 --> 01:23:51,075
It is just hungry.
We must feed it.

1442
01:23:52,069 --> 01:23:53,990
Why are you looking at me?

1443
01:23:54,112 --> 01:23:55,833
We gotta get this shit started.

1444
01:23:56,323 --> 01:24:00,464
<i>Oh, yeah. Have I got
a show for you bitches!</i>

1445
01:24:06,625 --> 01:24:09,128
Motherfucker, Motherfucker...

1446
01:24:09,586 --> 01:24:11,841
<i>All right, party people!</i>

1447
01:24:12,297 --> 01:24:14,848
<i>We are gonna
kill Kick-Ass,</i>

1448
01:24:15,008 --> 01:24:18,686
<i>the very first superhero,
together.</i>

1449
01:24:18,845 --> 01:24:23,933
<i>We are gonna cut him up into little
pieces, feed that shit to MC Shark</i>

1450
01:24:23,934 --> 01:24:27,270
<i>and post it all over YouTube.
For real!</i>

1451
01:24:29,064 --> 01:24:30,273
He's kidding, right?

1452
01:24:30,274 --> 01:24:31,607
Motherfucker don't kid.

1453
01:24:31,608 --> 01:24:35,202
<i>That's not it. I'm gonna give
each and every one of you</i>

1454
01:24:35,362 --> 01:24:37,865
<i>party favor fertilizer bombs!</i>

1455
01:24:38,031 --> 01:24:39,657
<i>And we are gonna
get our riot on!</i>

1456
01:24:39,658 --> 01:24:41,580
<i>That's what it
means to be evil.</i>

1457
01:24:41,702 --> 01:24:44,916
<i>We, my friends,
are the real 1%,</i>

1458
01:24:45,038 --> 01:24:48,958
<i>and tonight we are gonna fuck
this city up or my name is not...</i>

1459
01:24:48,959 --> 01:24:51,085
Chris D'Amico!

1460
01:24:52,296 --> 01:24:54,383
<i>That is not my name!</i>

1461
01:24:56,758 --> 01:25:00,471
No, you're right. Your
new name's Little Bitch.

1462
01:25:04,558 --> 01:25:06,314
<i>Oh, this is perfect.</i>

1463
01:25:07,269 --> 01:25:09,903
<i>Are you really that stupid?</i>

1464
01:25:10,564 --> 01:25:15,285
<i>There's two of you
and a whole army of us.</i>

1465
01:25:16,361 --> 01:25:19,042
<i>Do you really have
such a hard-on to die?</i>

1466
01:25:20,449 --> 01:25:21,742
No.

1467
01:25:21,867 --> 01:25:24,335
That's why we
brought our friends.

1468
01:25:55,442 --> 01:25:58,290
What's the matter, Chris?
Shit hit your shorts?

1469
01:25:58,737 --> 01:26:02,913
Yeah, and I'm gonna wipe
my ass with your face.

1470
01:26:04,493 --> 01:26:07,791
You're gonna pay for
what you did to my dad.

1471
01:26:08,121 --> 01:26:12,132
Your dad? You blew up
my dad with a bazooka.

1472
01:26:18,673 --> 01:26:19,966
Oh!

1473
01:26:45,409 --> 01:26:48,089
Are you ready to die,
little girl?

1474
01:26:48,286 --> 01:26:52,379
I might be if I have to keep looking
at that shit-stain you call a face.

1475
01:27:02,175 --> 01:27:03,219
Chris!

1476
01:27:59,357 --> 01:28:03,070
Hold him down. I wanna see
what his guts look like.

1477
01:28:07,282 --> 01:28:08,991
That's enough from you boys!

1478
01:28:12,913 --> 01:28:14,918
Nicely done, sweetheart.

1479
01:28:23,465 --> 01:28:24,757
That all you got?

1480
01:28:24,758 --> 01:28:27,635
No, I got my lethal
zero G device.

1481
01:28:27,636 --> 01:28:28,761
Bullshit.

1482
01:28:30,305 --> 01:28:31,562
No shit.

1483
01:28:47,614 --> 01:28:48,781
Are you okay?

1484
01:28:50,951 --> 01:28:53,631
Yeah. Thanks.
Ass Kicker.

1485
01:28:56,289 --> 01:28:57,416
Nice.

1486
01:30:04,691 --> 01:30:06,910
Jesus, you are such a pussy.

1487
01:30:07,027 --> 01:30:09,744
What is the point of wearing a mask
if you can't do what you want?

1488
01:30:16,578 --> 01:30:18,298
We want to do good.

1489
01:30:18,413 --> 01:30:20,414
No, people want
to win the lottery.

1490
01:30:21,583 --> 01:30:24,632
People want to fuck
Scarlett Johansson.

1491
01:30:35,096 --> 01:30:38,809
You think you can kill me
with little needle?

1492
01:30:57,494 --> 01:30:59,578
That's not what it's for.

1493
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:05,090
It's called adrenaline, bitch.

1494
01:31:07,087 --> 01:31:08,796
What was that, some cheap shot?

1495
01:31:08,797 --> 01:31:10,434
That was for the Colonel.

1496
01:31:13,802 --> 01:31:14,845
Ahh!

1497
01:31:17,347 --> 01:31:18,391
That's for Night Bitch.

1498
01:31:26,147 --> 01:31:27,654
And that's for my dad.

1499
01:32:04,018 --> 01:32:05,905
What the hell are you doing?

1500
01:32:06,354 --> 01:32:07,896
Saving your whiny ass!

1501
01:32:07,897 --> 01:32:09,022
No!

1502
01:32:09,023 --> 01:32:12,568
I won't let you have this.
I'd rather die!

1503
01:32:12,569 --> 01:32:16,709
What is wrong with you, dude? This
is not a comic book, it's real life!

1504
01:32:17,031 --> 01:32:20,378
When you're dead, it's done.
There's no sequel.

1505
01:32:20,493 --> 01:32:25,215
You made this real. You started it!
And I'm gonna finish it.

1506
01:32:25,582 --> 01:32:28,928
I'll be immortal,
like an evil Jesus.

1507
01:32:39,387 --> 01:32:40,431
Wait!

1508
01:32:52,984 --> 01:32:55,285
I'm alive.

1509
01:32:55,403 --> 01:32:56,744
Dave, I'm so sorry.

1510
01:33:05,997 --> 01:33:08,251
<i>The feeling was indescribable.</i>

1511
01:33:08,750 --> 01:33:10,921
<i>Chris D'Amico, dead.</i>

1512
01:33:12,086 --> 01:33:15,433
<i>His wannabe supervillains,
defeated.</i>

1513
01:33:16,925 --> 01:33:19,772
<i>But did we make
the world a better place?</i>

1514
01:33:20,720 --> 01:33:25,395
<i>Or did we just finish something that
began when I first put on this mask?</i>

1515
01:33:28,228 --> 01:33:30,233
The cops are coming.

1516
01:33:30,897 --> 01:33:32,481
They'll take
care of the bad guys.

1517
01:33:32,482 --> 01:33:35,447
We better skedaddle
before they get here.

1518
01:33:35,985 --> 01:33:37,110
We did it.

1519
01:33:37,111 --> 01:33:38,237
Fuck, yeah.

1520
01:33:38,238 --> 01:33:39,994
Hey, language.

1521
01:33:40,406 --> 01:33:44,962
You're right, if we're gonna dress like
heroes, we should act like heroes.

1522
01:33:45,954 --> 01:33:48,125
He'd be proud of you, Dave.

1523
01:33:48,748 --> 01:33:50,967
He'd be proud of all of us.

1524
01:33:52,877 --> 01:33:55,297
You know we can never
do this again, right?

1525
01:33:57,340 --> 01:33:58,681
It's over.

1526
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:04,475
One last time.
Come on.

1527
01:34:08,351 --> 01:34:11,697
What do you say,
Hit Girl? Are you in?

1528
01:34:13,481 --> 01:34:15,320
Why the hell not?

1529
01:34:17,110 --> 01:34:19,115
Justice Forever!

1530
01:34:30,832 --> 01:34:33,679
Thanks for the ride.

1531
01:34:34,127 --> 01:34:36,179
I'll see you at school.

1532
01:34:38,006 --> 01:34:40,177
I'm leaving New York, Dave.

1533
01:34:40,758 --> 01:34:44,270
I can't go home. I can't put
Marcus in that position.

1534
01:34:44,512 --> 01:34:47,526
Why? He won't arrest you.
You just saved the city.

1535
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:50,654
Yeah, well, I also killed
six guys with a cop's gun.

1536
01:34:50,768 --> 01:34:53,153
Vigilantes don't
get a free pass.

1537
01:34:53,855 --> 01:34:57,449
You can't go.
People need you.

1538
01:34:58,651 --> 01:35:00,407
They've got you now.
Mindy...

1539
01:35:03,031 --> 01:35:04,584
I'm not like you.

1540
01:35:04,699 --> 01:35:08,163
You don't have to be a bad-ass
to be a superhero, Dave.

1541
01:35:10,204 --> 01:35:12,375
You just have to be brave.

1542
01:35:24,302 --> 01:35:25,394
What was that?

1543
01:35:28,598 --> 01:35:30,520
That was my first kiss.

1544
01:35:32,393 --> 01:35:35,905
Be nice or I'll rip your ass
out through your mouth.

1545
01:35:42,820 --> 01:35:44,113
<i>When Mindy left,</i>

1546
01:35:44,822 --> 01:35:48,168
<i>that's when I finally understood
where my life was going.</i>

1547
01:35:49,202 --> 01:35:51,870
<i>Just like it had to
eventually happen,</i>

1548
01:35:51,871 --> 01:35:54,968
<i>that real people would
try to be superheroes.</i>

1549
01:35:55,583 --> 01:35:58,300
<i>Eventually it had to end, too.</i>

1550
01:36:14,852 --> 01:36:18,649
<i>Superheroes can't exist in
the real world for a reason.</i>

1551
01:36:18,773 --> 01:36:22,783
<i>It's because the real
world needs real heroes.</i>

1552
01:36:23,528 --> 01:36:26,790
<i>And not some punk in a
wet-suit playing dress-up,</i>

1553
01:36:27,365 --> 01:36:31,790
<i>but a genuine bad-ass
who can really kick ass.</i>

1554
01:42:18,340 --> 01:42:19,681
