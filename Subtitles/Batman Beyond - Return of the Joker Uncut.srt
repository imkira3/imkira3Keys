Stay back!

3
00:00:40,277 --> 00:00:42,176
He should've said "heel".

4
00:01:04,901 --> 00:01:06,265
Slag it!

5
00:01:09,472 --> 00:01:13,534
-He's got a delicate touch, Dee Dee.
-Delicate like a moose, Dee Dee.

6
00:01:16,712 --> 00:01:20,739
I hate ripping this heavy junk.
Give me cash cards any day.

7
00:01:22,052 --> 00:01:26,078
Zip it, Bonk.
Plan is get in and get out fast.

8
00:01:28,757 --> 00:01:32,215
It's a school night, boys and girls.
I'm gonna have to call your folks.

9
00:01:58,087 --> 00:01:59,816
Bonk! Don't!

10
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:01,757
Yeah, Bonk.
Don't.

11
00:03:29,556 --> 00:03:31,650
Let's go! Dee Dee,
open the door.

12
00:03:31,859 --> 00:03:33,292
On the double.

13
00:04:03,157 --> 00:04:04,454
Incoming!

14
00:04:14,102 --> 00:04:16,036
Bonk! You moron!
Get back here!

15
00:05:00,148 --> 00:05:01,877
You got a death wish,
Bats!

16
00:05:02,115 --> 00:05:04,709
And I thought I was just
being a good citizen.

17
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:10,848
Got you, sis!

18
00:05:20,495 --> 00:05:21,927
Flagpole.

19
00:05:22,398 --> 00:05:23,456
What did you say?

20
00:05:23,665 --> 00:05:25,132
Flagpole.

21
00:05:39,848 --> 00:05:41,076
Come on!

22
00:06:09,946 --> 00:06:12,312
That ain't coming
out of my allowance.

23
00:08:33,418 --> 00:08:35,079
Still got it.

24
00:08:46,932 --> 00:08:48,797
How did it go with the Jokerz?

25
00:08:49,533 --> 00:08:52,264
I broke up the robbery,
but it was weird.

26
00:08:53,203 --> 00:08:56,639
Third time this month that particulary
gang intercepted high-tech machinery.

27
00:08:56,841 --> 00:08:58,240
Jokerz don't use that stuff.

28
00:08:58,677 --> 00:09:02,134
They're probably fencing it.
Corporate espionage is big business.

29
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:05,706
I'll sit tight until
I can get another shot at them.

30
00:09:06,918 --> 00:09:08,144
Hey,
lookie here.

31
00:09:08,451 --> 00:09:09,418
That's right,
Tom.

32
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:12,679
Today, Gotham billionaire Bruce Wayne
stunned the financial world...

33
00:09:12,889 --> 00:09:16,418
... with his plan to resume active
leadership of Wayne Enterprises.

34
00:09:16,626 --> 00:09:19,528
While shareholders have generally
welcomed Wayne's return...

35
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:23,495
...support from some key members of the
Wayne board has been oddly lukewarm.

36
00:09:23,701 --> 00:09:27,227
Company operations manager,
Jordan Pryce, offered this comment:

37
00:09:27,438 --> 00:09:30,100
I, of course, join the rest of our
Wayne Enterprises family...

38
00:09:30,307 --> 00:09:34,643
...in welcoming back our most valuable
senior resource, Bruce Wayne.

39
00:09:34,846 --> 00:09:38,110
I'm sure we'll all profit
from his years of experience.

40
00:09:38,317 --> 00:09:41,980
Still, the day to day rigors of running
a vast, multinational conglomerate...

41
00:09:42,187 --> 00:09:44,346
... would be stressful,
even for a young man.

42
00:09:44,556 --> 00:09:46,750
I hope Mr. Wayne is up
to the challenge.

43
00:09:47,057 --> 00:09:48,754
He's not bitter,
much.

44
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:51,493
Pryce was next in line
for the top spot.

45
00:09:51,928 --> 00:09:54,922
My return torpedoed any dreams
he had of succession.

46
00:09:55,667 --> 00:09:58,692
-You gonna keep him around?
-If he'll stay on my terms.

47
00:09:58,903 --> 00:10:02,600
I've worked long and hard to regain
control of my family's company.

48
00:10:02,807 --> 00:10:04,365
I won't hand it over again.

49
00:10:04,576 --> 00:10:08,510
Pryce can either get with that program
or start e-mailing his résumé.

50
00:10:08,846 --> 00:10:11,177
With all the long hours you'll planning
on putting in at the office...

51
00:10:11,383 --> 00:10:13,942
...does this mean
you'll have less time for....

52
00:10:14,351 --> 00:10:15,841
Who sleeps anymore?

53
00:10:19,356 --> 00:10:20,346
You okay?

54
00:10:20,557 --> 00:10:22,652
The Jokerz are going in
for splicing now.

55
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:27,125
Crazy hyena-boy nearly took a bite out of me.
No way I could explain that to Dana.

56
00:10:27,331 --> 00:10:28,629
You're not going out now?

57
00:10:28,832 --> 00:10:30,461
The night is young and so am I.

58
00:10:30,668 --> 00:10:33,331
I think a good night's rest
might be more beneficial.

59
00:10:33,638 --> 00:10:36,298
Like you said,
who sleeps anymore?

60
00:10:44,481 --> 00:10:46,211
Up and at them,
Terry.

61
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:51,783
You can doze on Bruce Wayne's time,
not mine.

62
00:10:52,023 --> 00:10:53,422
Sorry, Dane.

63
00:11:19,884 --> 00:11:21,546
Great song,
huh?

64
00:11:22,952 --> 00:11:26,253
Did you see the squid Blade's with?
P.U.!

65
00:11:28,326 --> 00:11:30,418
Ter,
my head's on fire.

66
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,195
You look good.

67
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:33,889
McGinnis!

68
00:11:39,104 --> 00:11:42,471
Sorry, babe. Guess the day
was longer than I thought.

69
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:47,177
Let's sit this one out.

70
00:11:48,379 --> 00:11:50,711
Coffee.
And leave the pot.

71
00:11:55,385 --> 00:11:57,412
Batman showed up
and we had to ditch.

72
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:01,581
We were able to save this:
the console's memory board.

73
00:12:02,894 --> 00:12:04,259
I know it's not much but--

74
00:12:04,796 --> 00:12:08,061
It's not much?
It's nothing.

75
00:12:10,701 --> 00:12:12,168
Losers.

76
00:12:12,971 --> 00:12:13,995
All of you.

77
00:12:14,206 --> 00:12:18,267
A disgrace to the name Joker.
Why, in my day--

78
00:12:18,475 --> 00:12:19,841
In your day?!

79
00:12:20,043 --> 00:12:22,274
Ever since you cone
your way into this gang...

80
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,416
...it's been "your day" this
and "your day" that.

81
00:12:25,615 --> 00:12:26,548
Bonk.

82
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,514
Your day is over,
old man.

83
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,779
Even if you are who you say you are.
And personally, I think you're a fake.

84
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:35,721
Ah,
brave new world...

85
00:12:35,927 --> 00:12:38,191
...
that has such putzes in it.

86
00:12:38,596 --> 00:12:42,363
He's got us running around ripping
a lot of geek junk, but no cash!

87
00:12:42,932 --> 00:12:45,960
He won't tell us what his plan is,
if he even has one.

88
00:12:46,171 --> 00:12:48,105
I want out!

89
00:12:48,373 --> 00:12:49,965
If you insist.

90
00:12:53,644 --> 00:12:57,479
Hey, man. Take it easy.
I was just kidding.

91
00:13:00,652 --> 00:13:02,413
So was I.

92
00:13:12,364 --> 00:13:15,024
Oops. No,
I wasn't.

93
00:13:16,868 --> 00:13:19,701
That's also how we
did it in my day.

94
00:13:21,941 --> 00:13:25,966
You know, kids, a lot has changed
while your old Uncle Joker's been away.

95
00:13:26,177 --> 00:13:28,509
New Gotham,
new rules...

96
00:13:28,715 --> 00:13:31,041
...
even a new Batman.

97
00:13:33,285 --> 00:13:35,684
But now I'm tanned,
I'm rested...

98
00:13:36,187 --> 00:13:40,052
...and I'm ready to give
this old town a wedgie again!

99
00:13:40,725 --> 00:13:42,192
I have to know
you're with me.

100
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:46,259
-Will you say it for me one time?
-We're with you.

101
00:13:46,767 --> 00:13:49,292
-Little louder.
-We're with you!

102
00:13:49,503 --> 00:13:50,697
Dee Dee?

103
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:53,336
-We're with you!
-Boys?

104
00:13:53,538 --> 00:13:56,441
-We're with you.
-Bonk?

105
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:58,743
Alright.

106
00:13:59,152 --> 00:13:59,702
Dead.

107
00:14:00,812 --> 00:14:03,240
Dee Dee, be lam
and sweap out the trash.

108
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:04,849
There's good girls.

109
00:14:09,226 --> 00:14:12,892
Your renewed faith puts
a smile in my heart.

110
00:14:13,162 --> 00:14:16,129
What's if we forget tonight
mishappen and start over...

111
00:14:16,927 --> 00:14:18,394
Great, boss.

112
00:14:18,663 --> 00:14:22,360
Ghoul, my boy, we're going
to need another systems scanner.

113
00:14:22,567 --> 00:14:25,091
Who's got one
they'd be willing to donate?

114
00:14:25,302 --> 00:14:26,496
Checking.

115
00:14:26,837 --> 00:14:29,135
What we're after
is cutting-edge.

116
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:32,240
These are the only other places
we'd find one.

117
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:34,043
Nope.

118
00:14:34,412 --> 00:14:35,504
No.

119
00:14:36,614 --> 00:14:39,605
What, there?
Security's gonna be tight!

120
00:14:40,217 --> 00:14:43,448
Oh, yes.
But think of the fun.

121
00:14:49,326 --> 00:14:50,692
Good evening,
Mr. Wayne.

122
00:14:50,961 --> 00:14:53,931
Ms. Carr. You remember
my assistant, Terry McGinnis?

123
00:14:54,131 --> 00:14:56,532
Of course. I'm glad
you could join us, Terry.

124
00:14:57,467 --> 00:15:01,768
Everyone is here. Well, everyone
except Mr. Pryce, unfortunately.

125
00:15:01,972 --> 00:15:03,530
That's no surprise.

126
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:06,539
May I have your attention,
please?

127
00:15:06,744 --> 00:15:11,077
It's my pleasure to welcome back
the guiding light of this company:

128
00:15:12,015 --> 00:15:13,711
Bruce Wayne.

129
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:22,182
Thank you,
Joyce.

130
00:15:22,393 --> 00:15:26,523
It's a pleasure to see you all again.
In the future, I hope to--

131
00:15:33,904 --> 00:15:37,135
--spend time getting to know
each member of our company...

132
00:15:37,341 --> 00:15:39,865
...learning about
you individually.

133
00:16:00,932 --> 00:16:01,761
Security!

134
00:16:01,966 --> 00:16:04,092
Emergency on terrace level.

135
00:16:08,873 --> 00:16:10,533
Hey!
Look out!

136
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:28,457
-You gonna be okay?
-Go to work.

137
00:16:31,095 --> 00:16:33,153
Well,
if it isn't old Mr. Wayne.

138
00:16:33,998 --> 00:16:35,225
So debonair.

139
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,524
So dapper.

140
00:16:39,236 --> 00:16:40,499
So decrepit.

141
00:16:54,217 --> 00:16:55,480
Hello, Gotham!

142
00:16:55,686 --> 00:16:57,677
Joker's back in town!

143
00:17:00,725 --> 00:17:02,192
It can't be.

144
00:17:02,393 --> 00:17:06,591
Oh, no, your old eyes
do not deceive you, Brucie!

145
00:17:06,797 --> 00:17:09,595
After all, who'd know me
better than you?

146
00:17:12,368 --> 00:17:13,528
Back off,
gruesome.

147
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,641
Ah,
the new boy.

148
00:17:19,843 --> 00:17:22,038
Ears are too long
and I miss the cape...

149
00:17:22,244 --> 00:17:25,077
...but not too shabby.
Not too shabby at all.

150
00:17:25,281 --> 00:17:26,375
Woof!

151
00:17:38,228 --> 00:17:41,321
-How's it coming, boys?
-We're home free.

152
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:43,020
Then I'll see you there.

153
00:17:47,872 --> 00:17:49,838
Time to go,
Dee Dee.

154
00:18:26,776 --> 00:18:29,074
Well?
What's it gonna be, Batfake?

155
00:18:59,174 --> 00:19:02,076
I know what you're thinking.
I messed up.

156
00:19:02,278 --> 00:19:04,472
I let the clown go
to save those people.

157
00:19:04,847 --> 00:19:06,212
You did the right thing.

158
00:19:06,782 --> 00:19:11,549
So, the Joker, huh? Looks pretty spry
for a guy who's gotta be, what?

159
00:19:11,755 --> 00:19:13,018
Mid-eighties?

160
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:16,520
Any theories on that?

161
00:19:16,792 --> 00:19:17,884
Clone?

162
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,354
Robot?

163
00:19:19,561 --> 00:19:23,124
Suspended animation due to floating
around frozen in a block of ice?

164
00:19:23,334 --> 00:19:24,823
Shut up and drive.

165
00:19:26,568 --> 00:19:27,557
Yes, sir.

166
00:19:34,845 --> 00:19:39,248
This was the scene three hours ago, as a
man claiming to be the legendary Joker...

167
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:43,351
...disrupted a ceremony at the newly
open Wayne Enterprises building.

168
00:19:43,553 --> 00:19:45,076
Honey,
what're you watching?

169
00:19:45,288 --> 00:19:49,087
Adding to the drama was another
legendary Gotham icon, the Batman...

170
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:52,692
... who engaged his one-time foe
in a stunning aerial battle.

171
00:19:53,063 --> 00:19:54,154
Honey?

172
00:19:54,365 --> 00:19:55,762
It's nothing,
sweetheart.

173
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,733
Nothing.

174
00:20:09,113 --> 00:20:10,101
Go away.

175
00:20:10,446 --> 00:20:11,435
Morning,
commish.

176
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:14,309
You understand English, McGinnis?
Scram.

177
00:20:14,518 --> 00:20:17,713
Love to. But first, what can you
tell me about clowns?

178
00:20:18,087 --> 00:20:20,282
In this town
they're never funny.

179
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:22,013
I noticed that.

180
00:20:24,861 --> 00:20:27,057
-Now, this Joker--
-Drop it, kid.

181
00:20:27,262 --> 00:20:30,231
-That's what the old man's been saying.
-Listen to him.

182
00:20:30,432 --> 00:20:34,493
Hey look, I know this fruitcake was a big,
bad guy from the cape and cowl days.

183
00:20:34,703 --> 00:20:36,068
He was more than that.

184
00:20:36,271 --> 00:20:38,467
What? A wacko
who threatened people...

185
00:20:38,674 --> 00:20:41,076
...with whoopee cushions
and squirting flowers?

186
00:20:41,376 --> 00:20:43,403
-Big deal. I'm shaking.
-McGinnis!

187
00:20:47,951 --> 00:20:51,078
The Joker, the real Joker, was unlike
anyone you've ever faced.

188
00:20:51,288 --> 00:20:53,221
For your sake,
I hope you never do.

189
00:20:53,423 --> 00:20:55,788
If Bruce wants you to drop it,
then drop it.

190
00:20:57,461 --> 00:21:00,759
-Commissioner, your 9:00 is here.
-Send him in.

191
00:21:01,065 --> 00:21:02,053
You were leaving?

192
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,990
Figure I was.

193
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:19,380
-Thanks for seeing me, Barb.
-That's what I'm here for.

194
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,000
JOKER
DECEASED

195
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,520
VOICE ID

196
00:21:39,736 --> 00:21:42,500
--a countdown of victims
that will end at midnight...

197
00:21:42,704 --> 00:21:46,435
...unless our dear Dark Knight
stops me first!

198
00:21:50,114 --> 00:21:53,146
Hello, Gotham.
Joker's back in town!

199
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:56,840
VOICE MATCH
IDENTICAL

200
00:22:01,959 --> 00:22:03,153
It's funny.

201
00:22:03,394 --> 00:22:06,953
I know about all of your other major
enemies but you never mention him.

202
00:22:07,298 --> 00:22:11,426
-He was the biggest, wasn't he?
-It wasn't a popularity contest.

203
00:22:11,634 --> 00:22:14,297
He was a psychopath.
A monster.

204
00:22:14,871 --> 00:22:17,864
So how is it possible he could still
be around after all this time?

205
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,865
It's not possible.

206
00:22:20,076 --> 00:22:22,044
He died years ago.

207
00:22:22,244 --> 00:22:23,233
You're sure?

208
00:22:23,512 --> 00:22:24,945
I was there.

209
00:22:29,086 --> 00:22:30,746
You killed him,
didn't you?

210
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:35,959
He was gonna do something so terrible,
you had no other choice.

211
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,558
-Terry--
-That was it, wasn't it?

212
00:22:42,598 --> 00:22:45,067
I want you to give back
the Batman suit.

213
00:22:45,402 --> 00:22:47,561
What? Why?

214
00:22:47,769 --> 00:22:50,397
There is no reason for you
to continue.

215
00:22:50,606 --> 00:22:53,076
You've made your father's killers
pay for his murder.

216
00:22:53,409 --> 00:22:57,573
...then put your own needs aside to help
the city when it most needed a hero.

217
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:02,580
You've honored the reputation of Batman
many times over and for that I thank you.

218
00:23:02,853 --> 00:23:03,840
Then why?

219
00:23:04,453 --> 00:23:08,253
I had no right to force this life
on you or anyone else.

220
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:11,518
I was the one who broke in
and swiped the suit, remember?

221
00:23:12,194 --> 00:23:16,257
Yes, there was my dad's murder, but we
come from two different worlds, Mr. Wayne.

222
00:23:16,465 --> 00:23:18,763
I wasn't like you
or the kids you took in.

223
00:23:20,303 --> 00:23:22,499
I was a pretty bad kid once.

224
00:23:22,704 --> 00:23:26,435
Ran with a rough crowd, broke a lot of
laws and say nothing to my folks' hearts.

225
00:23:27,042 --> 00:23:30,205
The kind of punk you wouldn't have wasted
a second punch on back in that day.

226
00:23:30,547 --> 00:23:31,536
Your point?

227
00:23:32,316 --> 00:23:34,714
I'm trying to make
up for past sins.

228
00:23:35,484 --> 00:23:39,115
The state says my 3 months in juvie wiped
me clean, but my soul tells me different.

229
00:23:39,757 --> 00:23:43,625
Every time I put on that suit is my
chance to help people who are in trouble.

230
00:23:44,662 --> 00:23:46,721
I guess on a personal level...

231
00:23:46,931 --> 00:23:50,162
...it's a chance to look like
a worthwhile human being again.

232
00:23:50,365 --> 00:23:52,299
In my eyes,
no one else's.

233
00:23:54,269 --> 00:23:55,896
It's what I want,
Bruce.

234
00:23:58,473 --> 00:23:59,567
Stupid kid.

235
00:24:00,076 --> 00:24:03,740
You don't know what you want.
None of you ever did.

236
00:24:37,212 --> 00:24:40,547
Mom, come quick!
Some weirdo broke into our house!

237
00:24:40,817 --> 00:24:45,084
-Matty? What are you yelling about?
-There's a stranger's sitting at our table!

238
00:24:45,288 --> 00:24:48,154
-Ha, ha.
-That's your brother.

239
00:24:49,858 --> 00:24:51,792
I've never seen him
before in my life.

240
00:24:51,994 --> 00:24:55,864
It is rare that you're up before noon, Terry
what with your job and all.

241
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,666
I'm not working for Mr.
Wayne anymore.

242
00:25:01,069 --> 00:25:04,471
Well, it will be nice to have you home
for a change. Right, Matt?

243
00:25:04,673 --> 00:25:08,371
Sure. Great. Just when I was
getting used to being an only child.

244
00:25:10,779 --> 00:25:11,873
Mom!

245
00:25:18,453 --> 00:25:22,480
Once in a while, we have to do it, Dane.
Ditch the guys and go out by ourselves.

246
00:25:22,692 --> 00:25:26,788
It may be a change for you, Chelsea. I don't
see enough of Terry to know the difference.

247
00:25:26,996 --> 00:25:30,797
Terry's sweet and all, but who says
you can't make friends with someone new?

248
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,057
Not a chance.

249
00:25:32,367 --> 00:25:33,630
Terry!

250
00:25:34,738 --> 00:25:37,036
I thought you'd be
working as usual.

251
00:25:38,008 --> 00:25:41,307
The bad news is, for the time being,
I'm not gonna have much money coming in.

252
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:44,070
The good news is,
you have me all to yourself.

253
00:25:44,681 --> 00:25:46,375
I can live with that.

254
00:26:00,529 --> 00:26:01,759
Cutting in.

255
00:26:06,301 --> 00:26:07,394
Hey!

256
00:26:13,844 --> 00:26:14,866
Dana?

257
00:26:29,592 --> 00:26:30,580
What is it,
boy?

258
00:26:32,828 --> 00:26:33,659
Ace.

259
00:26:37,401 --> 00:26:38,559
Ace!

260
00:27:06,864 --> 00:27:11,492
Don't get up, Bruce. It's just
an old friend come by to say hello.

261
00:27:19,407 --> 00:27:20,704
Hello...

262
00:27:21,109 --> 00:27:22,509
...Batman.

263
00:27:27,951 --> 00:27:29,178
Dana!

264
00:27:32,454 --> 00:27:33,944
It was her.

265
00:27:56,525 --> 00:27:58,347
wants a dreg like you
outta the way, but...

266
00:27:58,347 --> 00:28:00,278
hey,
as long as it's fun...

267
00:28:04,277 --> 00:28:05,335
Terry!

268
00:28:06,943 --> 00:28:07,775
Dana!

269
00:28:10,948 --> 00:28:13,178
-Let me go!
-Sure, cutes.

270
00:28:20,289 --> 00:28:21,722
Slag him!

271
00:28:36,272 --> 00:28:38,605
-Dana?
-Stay out of sight!

272
00:28:57,892 --> 00:28:58,721
There!

273
00:29:12,538 --> 00:29:13,632
What's he doing?

274
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,240
You got me.

275
00:29:16,375 --> 00:29:18,038
Just finish him!

276
00:29:37,464 --> 00:29:40,332
You made a mess,
dreg.

277
00:29:51,442 --> 00:29:52,273
Dana!

278
00:29:52,479 --> 00:29:55,936
She's got a bad bump and some cuts,
but she's gonna be okay.

279
00:29:56,414 --> 00:29:59,351
-Why were those guys after you?
-I don't know.

280
00:29:59,553 --> 00:30:02,044
Look I'm gonna talk to the cops.
Stay with her, okay, Chels?

281
00:30:02,255 --> 00:30:04,847
-I'll come as soon as I can.
-Sure.

282
00:30:21,173 --> 00:30:22,505
Leave a message.

283
00:30:22,709 --> 00:30:25,371
Hey, the Joker's little playmates
were after me tonight.

284
00:30:25,577 --> 00:30:27,135
Me, not Batman.

285
00:30:27,346 --> 00:30:29,472
This whole thing stinks, Wayne,
and you know why.

286
00:30:29,682 --> 00:30:34,483
I need some straight answers from--
Wait, it's night. Where does he go?

287
00:30:55,673 --> 00:30:56,505
Wayne?

288
00:30:57,009 --> 00:30:58,102
Wayne!

289
00:31:03,148 --> 00:31:04,173
Ace.

290
00:31:18,964 --> 00:31:20,865
Please,
God, no.

291
00:31:49,528 --> 00:31:50,518
Floor...

292
00:31:54,467 --> 00:31:55,957
...under...

293
00:31:58,371 --> 00:31:59,565
...table.

294
00:32:34,907 --> 00:32:35,895
How is he?

295
00:32:36,276 --> 00:32:39,768
The anti-toxin's done all it can.
It's up to him now.

296
00:32:39,979 --> 00:32:42,503
Thanks for coming.
I didn't know who else to call.

297
00:32:42,715 --> 00:32:43,682
Who else is there?

298
00:32:44,284 --> 00:32:47,515
That reminds me. I'd better
check on our other patient.

299
00:32:50,256 --> 00:32:52,190
What have I done?

300
00:32:52,858 --> 00:32:55,851
I killed the little rabbit.

301
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:59,595
I don't deserve to live!

302
00:33:05,903 --> 00:33:07,667
How you doing,
killer?

303
00:33:11,111 --> 00:33:13,306
Yeah,
rough night for me too.

304
00:33:13,846 --> 00:33:16,144
Sad news from the financial world
this morning.

305
00:33:16,347 --> 00:33:20,750
The return of Bruce Wayne to his family
company has been delayed due to an accident.

306
00:33:20,952 --> 00:33:23,888
Wayne Enterprises' Jordan Pryce
had this to say:

307
00:33:24,089 --> 00:33:27,287
We received a call from
Mr. Wayne's houseboy this morning...

308
00:33:27,493 --> 00:33:29,984
...saying Mr. Wayne
had taken a bad fall.

309
00:33:30,596 --> 00:33:34,326
Everyone at the Wayne Enterprises' family
sends their prayers and good wishes...

310
00:33:34,534 --> 00:33:37,933
...to our senior member
for his speedy recovery.

311
00:33:38,872 --> 00:33:42,364
I'll bet. Not every creep in Gotham
wears a purple suit.

312
00:33:42,575 --> 00:33:44,509
It'd make my job
simpler if they did.

313
00:33:44,877 --> 00:33:48,814
The Joker knew about Bruce, about me,
probably about you too.

314
00:33:49,347 --> 00:33:50,976
Someone knows,
I'll give you that.

315
00:33:51,351 --> 00:33:54,080
But it's not the Joker.
Not the real one.

316
00:33:54,721 --> 00:33:56,346
Bruce said he was dead.

317
00:33:57,757 --> 00:33:58,586
And?

318
00:33:59,025 --> 00:34:00,219
That's it.

319
00:34:00,426 --> 00:34:02,190
I know there's more.

320
00:34:02,394 --> 00:34:05,489
Barbara, I'm part of this. I need
the answers Bruce can't give me.

321
00:34:06,266 --> 00:34:07,663
I deserve them.

322
00:34:13,906 --> 00:34:16,603
I thought talking about it
would get easier over time...

323
00:34:16,809 --> 00:34:18,710
...but some hurts
never go away.

324
00:34:20,144 --> 00:34:22,340
Dick Grayson,
Nightwing, had left...

325
00:34:22,547 --> 00:34:25,210
...to establish himself
in another city.

326
00:34:25,717 --> 00:34:30,121
There were three of us then:
Bruce, myself and Robin, Tim Drake.

327
00:34:39,731 --> 00:34:43,429
Robin was alone when
he came upon a woman in trouble.

328
00:34:43,969 --> 00:34:45,960
Help!
Help!

329
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:48,432
Somebody,
please, help!

330
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:52,509
Hero time.

331
00:34:58,951 --> 00:35:02,911
-That evens things up a little.
-Not really, bird-boy!

332
00:35:10,762 --> 00:35:12,525
A bird in the hand.

333
00:35:15,467 --> 00:35:17,458
We soon realized
Tim was missing.

334
00:35:19,572 --> 00:35:23,632
Night after night we scoured the city,
running down every lead...

335
00:35:23,842 --> 00:35:26,208
...pressing every
underworld connection.

336
00:35:29,882 --> 00:35:32,817
But no one had seen
any sign of Robin.

337
00:35:33,353 --> 00:35:36,652
For three agonizing weeks
there was nothing.

338
00:35:36,855 --> 00:35:40,451
Then one night,
we were sent an invitation.

339
00:36:10,922 --> 00:36:11,913
Arkham.

340
00:36:13,826 --> 00:36:17,157
The asylum had been moved
to a newer, high-security building.

341
00:36:17,362 --> 00:36:19,989
The old building had been
partially demolished...

342
00:36:20,197 --> 00:36:22,826
...and hung open
like a rotting wound.

343
00:36:30,041 --> 00:36:33,842
Hush, little baby,
don't say a word

344
00:36:34,047 --> 00:36:38,539
Mama's gonna buy
you a mocking bird

345
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:43,050
And if that
mocking bird don't sing

346
00:36:43,255 --> 00:36:47,750
Mama's gonna buy
you a diamond ring

347
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:52,896
And if that diamond
ring turns brass

348
00:36:53,164 --> 00:36:58,101
Mama's gonna buy
you a looking glass

349
00:36:57,972 --> 00:37:03,572
And if that looking
glass gets broke

350
00:37:05,043 --> 00:37:06,976
Pudding,
company!

351
00:37:09,748 --> 00:37:13,684
Hello there!
Welcome to our happy home.

352
00:37:18,023 --> 00:37:19,148
Where's Robin?

353
00:37:20,157 --> 00:37:21,215
Robin?

354
00:37:21,592 --> 00:37:23,027
There's no Robin here.

355
00:37:23,228 --> 00:37:25,320
Maybe he means our little J.

356
00:37:25,697 --> 00:37:27,393
Of course!
That's it!

357
00:37:33,505 --> 00:37:35,201
No peeking.

358
00:37:44,048 --> 00:37:45,880
Mommy's little helper.

359
00:37:48,954 --> 00:37:52,981
You know, Bats, we've been doing this
little runaround of ours for years.

360
00:37:53,224 --> 00:37:56,318
It's been loads of laughs,
but the sad fact is...

361
00:37:56,527 --> 00:37:58,461
...none of us are
getting any younger.

362
00:37:58,664 --> 00:38:00,655
That old clock's a-ticking.

363
00:38:00,865 --> 00:38:02,389
Quite right,
pooh.

364
00:38:02,768 --> 00:38:06,204
And Harley and I were thinking
it was time to start a family.

365
00:38:06,405 --> 00:38:09,568
Add a Joker Junior
to our merry brood.

366
00:38:09,974 --> 00:38:12,909
But rather than go through
all the joy of childbirth...

367
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:15,577
...we decided
to adopt.

368
00:38:17,449 --> 00:38:19,246
We couldn't do it legally...

369
00:38:19,451 --> 00:38:23,682
...but then we remembered you always
had a few spare kids hanging around.

370
00:38:23,889 --> 00:38:26,050
So we borrowed one.

371
00:38:30,096 --> 00:38:31,085
No.

372
00:38:31,297 --> 00:38:32,922
My God!

373
00:38:33,231 --> 00:38:37,692
He needed a little molding of course.
What kid doesn't?

374
00:38:37,902 --> 00:38:41,099
But in time we came
to love him as our own.

375
00:38:41,373 --> 00:38:43,773
Say hello, J.J.

376
00:39:16,338 --> 00:39:17,737
Robin!
Robin!

377
00:39:21,043 --> 00:39:24,911
Tim, it's Barbara.
Can you hear me?

378
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:39,885
Robin!
Stop!

379
00:39:40,963 --> 00:39:42,657
Hands off,
Brat-girl!

380
00:39:43,032 --> 00:39:45,967
Sweetie,
get Mommy's bazooka.

381
00:40:14,126 --> 00:40:16,059
How could you help
Joker do it, Harley?

382
00:40:16,494 --> 00:40:19,952
Okay, so he roughed the kid up
a little, but I'll make it right.

383
00:40:20,565 --> 00:40:23,159
Yeah, you're mother
of the stinking year.

384
00:40:23,367 --> 00:40:24,561
Ha! You'll see.

385
00:40:26,838 --> 00:40:30,068
We'll be one big,
happy family.

386
00:40:36,148 --> 00:40:37,137
Good boy!

387
00:41:27,865 --> 00:41:29,356
What's the matter,
Batman?

388
00:41:30,501 --> 00:41:32,525
No witty comeback?
No threat?

389
00:41:33,099 --> 00:41:35,304
Then I'll provide the narration.

390
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:42,500
OUR FAMILY MEMORIES

391
00:41:47,248 --> 00:41:52,186
I'll begin with how I peeled
back the layers of the boy's mind.

392
00:41:53,255 --> 00:41:56,155
Though, he bravely tried
to fight it at first.

393
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:10,652
You would have been proud
to see him so strong!

394
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:15,221
But all too soon...

395
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,740
...the serums and the shocks
took their toll.

396
00:42:18,431 --> 00:42:22,563
...the dear lad began
to share such secrets with me.

397
00:42:22,971 --> 00:42:26,405
Secrets that are
mine alone to know...

398
00:42:26,673 --> 00:42:28,141
...Bruce.

399
00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:31,806
It's true, Batsy.
I know everything.

400
00:42:32,014 --> 00:42:35,106
And like the kid who peeks
at his Christmas presents...

401
00:42:35,317 --> 00:42:38,807
...l must admit,
it's sadly anticlimactic.

402
00:42:39,019 --> 00:42:41,818
Behind all the Sturm
and batarangs...

403
00:42:42,023 --> 00:42:46,652
...you're just a little boy in a
playsuit, crying for Mommy and Daddy.

404
00:42:47,027 --> 00:42:49,429
It'd be funny,
if it weren't so pathetic.

405
00:42:51,164 --> 00:42:54,327
Oh, what the heck!
I'll laugh anyway.

406
00:43:08,449 --> 00:43:11,646
If you don't like the movie,
I've got slides.

407
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:26,056
I'll break you in two.

408
00:43:26,268 --> 00:43:27,757
Oh, Batman.

409
00:43:27,969 --> 00:43:31,768
If you had the guts for that kind
of fun, you'd have done it years ago.

410
00:43:31,972 --> 00:43:34,168
I, on the other hand...

411
00:43:45,016 --> 00:43:46,746
You've lost,
Batman.

412
00:43:47,251 --> 00:43:48,809
Robin is mine.

413
00:43:49,019 --> 00:43:52,855
The last sound you hear
will be our laughter.

414
00:43:55,492 --> 00:43:57,018
Here you go,
sonny-boy.

415
00:44:00,331 --> 00:44:04,398
Make daddy proud.
Deliver the punch line.

416
00:44:12,273 --> 00:44:12,858
Tim.

417
00:44:20,068 --> 00:44:20,556
Do it!

418
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:30,500
That's not funny.
That's not...

419
00:44:56,309 --> 00:44:59,278
It's okay, Tim.
It's okay.

420
00:44:59,414 --> 00:45:01,349
We buried the Joker
deep beneath Arkham.

421
00:45:01,815 --> 00:45:06,309
The only other person who knew what happened that
night was my father, the first commissioner Gordon.

422
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:08,818
He promissed to keep
our secret.

423
00:45:10,923 --> 00:45:12,824
With his last act of cruelty...

424
00:45:13,027 --> 00:45:17,862
...the Joker had tainted us all
with compromise and deception.

425
00:45:21,068 --> 00:45:23,501
I suppose he had
the last laugh after all.

426
00:45:23,704 --> 00:45:25,501
I'm assuming his girlfriend
bought it too.

427
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:29,798
We never found her body, but I doubt
she'd be starting trouble now.

428
00:45:31,813 --> 00:45:32,802
And Tim?

429
00:45:33,014 --> 00:45:35,675
We had a trusted friend,
Dr. Leslie Thompkins.

430
00:45:35,882 --> 00:45:39,443
It took her a year, but she was able
to help Tim back to sanity.

431
00:45:39,652 --> 00:45:42,179
Still, things were never
really the same.

432
00:45:42,489 --> 00:45:44,855
Bruce forbade Tim
to be Robin again.

433
00:45:45,192 --> 00:45:49,686
He blamed himself for what happened and swore
he'd never endanger another young partner.

434
00:45:50,163 --> 00:45:53,360
Tim left us soon after that,
determined to make it on his own.

435
00:45:54,235 --> 00:45:55,222
Did they patch it up?

436
00:45:55,737 --> 00:46:00,105
Tim tried once or twice, but you
know Bruce. I check up on Tim now and then.

437
00:46:00,474 --> 00:46:04,206
He's a top-level communications
engineer, married, couple kids.

438
00:46:04,679 --> 00:46:06,612
Not too bad,
all things concerned.

439
00:46:06,813 --> 00:46:08,371
He deserved a happy ending.

440
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:11,985
But he still has the most likely
connection to that night.

441
00:46:21,561 --> 00:46:24,826
It looks okay on this side.
I'm going up to the dish.

442
00:46:36,277 --> 00:46:39,836
You might as well show yourself.
I heard you a mile away.

443
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:44,376
I'm no Boy Wonder anymore,
but that old training never goes away.

444
00:46:44,585 --> 00:46:46,246
Even at my age.

445
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:47,650
Tim Drake.

446
00:46:48,288 --> 00:46:49,481
You heard about Bruce?

447
00:46:50,157 --> 00:46:52,592
Barbara told me.
That was too bad.

448
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:54,416
You're not too broken up.

449
00:46:54,628 --> 00:46:57,427
I had nothing to do with it,
despite what you might be thinking.

450
00:46:57,632 --> 00:47:00,931
When the Joker reappeared,
I was just as surprised as anyone.

451
00:47:01,134 --> 00:47:03,260
Barb told you the gory details?

452
00:47:03,769 --> 00:47:05,101
More or less.

453
00:47:05,306 --> 00:47:07,500
Look,
it's been almost 40 years.

454
00:47:07,708 --> 00:47:11,268
It wasn't easy, but I managed to put
it to bed and go on with my life.

455
00:47:11,478 --> 00:47:15,505
You'll have to do it yourself one day.
We all did.

456
00:47:15,715 --> 00:47:19,344
We gave our best, but in the end that
wasn't good enough for the old man.

457
00:47:20,121 --> 00:47:22,112
Regrets,
Mr. Drake?

458
00:47:22,489 --> 00:47:26,481
When I was younger, part of me thought
I would go on and on and someday....

459
00:47:27,327 --> 00:47:30,786
Capes, costumes, playing hero.
It was kids' stuff.

460
00:47:30,998 --> 00:47:32,760
Bruce probably did me a favor.

461
00:47:32,967 --> 00:47:37,494
In the end I was so sick of it, I never
wanted to see that stupid Robin suit again.

462
00:47:40,007 --> 00:47:41,804
Some things never change.

463
00:47:43,876 --> 00:47:45,846
Were all of you
bitter when you left?

464
00:47:46,278 --> 00:47:47,836
Comes with the territory,
McGinnis.

465
00:47:48,347 --> 00:47:50,577
Look up Nightwing, someday.
he has he got stories!

466
00:47:50,884 --> 00:47:53,818
Drake's clean. I've got
one more lead to check out.

467
00:47:54,019 --> 00:47:56,420
Someone with a definite grudge
against Bruce Wayne.

468
00:48:13,184 --> 00:48:16,753
Caviar, soft music and
charming company.

469
00:48:17,099 --> 00:48:19,650
Amy, my dear,
I can't think of any better way

470
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:22,692
to celebrate my ascension to
CEO of Wayne Enterprises.

471
00:48:23,050 --> 00:48:25,349
-Me neither.
-Me neither.

472
00:48:30,201 --> 00:48:33,396
You?
Where's Amy?

473
00:48:33,039 --> 00:48:34,563
Missed the boat,
I'm afraid.

474
00:48:38,777 --> 00:48:40,005
Turn the yacht around!

475
00:48:40,213 --> 00:48:43,909
Detox, boss man.
We're here to talk business.

476
00:48:44,117 --> 00:48:47,483
We'll be quick.
Woof gets seasick easy.

477
00:48:49,989 --> 00:48:52,081
Our business is concluded.

478
00:48:59,898 --> 00:49:01,489
You've got the equipment
you wanted.

479
00:49:01,701 --> 00:49:05,159
I gave you the security codes
so you could ransack the lab...

480
00:49:05,371 --> 00:49:08,237
...while those bunglers tried
to kill Wayne.

481
00:49:08,574 --> 00:49:11,099
Word is Wayne's terminal anyhow.

482
00:49:12,643 --> 00:49:15,010
That means you get
to stay top dog.

483
00:49:15,213 --> 00:49:16,545
And everyone's happy.

484
00:49:17,215 --> 00:49:18,547
So why are you here?

485
00:49:18,918 --> 00:49:23,650
The big guy who originally put us
in contact just decided you're a loose end.

486
00:49:23,856 --> 00:49:26,050
And loose ends
should be tied up.

487
00:49:33,699 --> 00:49:35,132
Let me go!

488
00:49:35,501 --> 00:49:36,728
Got him.

489
00:49:36,969 --> 00:49:39,905
Then amscray pronto,
kiddies.

490
00:49:43,242 --> 00:49:45,335
Things are going
to start popping.

491
00:49:45,777 --> 00:49:47,143
Let's go!

492
00:49:49,014 --> 00:49:51,175
No one's leaving
until I get answers.

493
00:49:55,521 --> 00:49:57,920
No, you idiot!
Not now!

494
00:50:07,166 --> 00:50:08,530
They're getting away!

495
00:50:09,568 --> 00:50:11,195
Yeah, and I think they've
got a good reason!

496
00:50:14,706 --> 00:50:17,197
-What's happening?
-Hang on!

497
00:51:00,318 --> 00:51:01,478
We saw the explosion.

498
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,945
You can ask Mr. Pryce
about that.

499
00:51:04,157 --> 00:51:06,351
Me?
I had nothing to do with it.

500
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:07,753
That right?

501
00:51:08,561 --> 00:51:11,996
I gave you the security codes
so you could ransack the lab...

502
00:51:12,197 --> 00:51:14,791
... while those bunglers tried
to kill Wayne.

503
00:51:15,001 --> 00:51:16,195
I want my lawyer.

504
00:51:16,402 --> 00:51:20,235
I think the commissioner would like
to hear this too. Night.

505
00:51:36,889 --> 00:51:38,378
I'm spent.

506
00:51:38,824 --> 00:51:42,317
Every lead I had has gone face-down,
and the Joker's still out there.

507
00:51:42,527 --> 00:51:43,893
What have you got?

508
00:51:44,764 --> 00:51:46,197
I don't know,
pup.

509
00:51:46,431 --> 00:51:49,697
If I was the Batman I was supposed
to be, I'd have cracked this...

510
00:51:49,902 --> 00:51:52,871
...would have punched the right data
into the computer...

511
00:51:53,072 --> 00:51:55,835
...or remembered that one clue
everyone else overlooked.

512
00:51:56,175 --> 00:51:57,802
It's rarely that simple.

513
00:52:04,784 --> 00:52:07,378
-How are you feeling?
-Lousy.

514
00:52:09,554 --> 00:52:11,215
Gordon told me what happened
to Tim Drake.

515
00:52:12,023 --> 00:52:15,425
That's why I didn't want you
going up against the Joker...

516
00:52:15,628 --> 00:52:16,992
...impostor or not.

517
00:52:17,329 --> 00:52:20,958
Nothing against your old partners,
but I'm a completely different Batman.

518
00:52:21,166 --> 00:52:22,827
I was never a Robin,
I never--

519
00:52:26,505 --> 00:52:27,699
Wait.

520
00:52:28,672 --> 00:52:30,436
Joker smashed up the cases...

521
00:52:30,643 --> 00:52:33,510
...but why was this the only costume
he went out of his way to destroy?

522
00:52:33,913 --> 00:52:35,244
Robin did shoot him.

523
00:52:35,514 --> 00:52:39,007
A ghost out for revenge?
I don't buy it. I talked to Drake.

524
00:52:39,217 --> 00:52:41,981
He's got less love
for that costume than the Joker.

525
00:52:42,188 --> 00:52:44,418
I think somehow
he's behind this.

526
00:52:44,623 --> 00:52:45,681
That's crazy.

527
00:52:45,891 --> 00:52:47,951
So was Drake,
once.

528
00:52:48,161 --> 00:52:52,063
Look, here's the readout of everything
we know the Jokerz have stolen.

529
00:52:54,666 --> 00:52:58,034
Now let's combine those into something that
would be used by a communications expert.

530
00:52:58,471 --> 00:53:00,199
Someone of Tim Drake's caliber.

531
00:53:03,041 --> 00:53:04,771
Satellite jamming system.

532
00:53:05,177 --> 00:53:08,112
Whoever uses this can access
satellite defense systems...

533
00:53:08,313 --> 00:53:09,679
...
and fire them at will.

534
00:53:09,882 --> 00:53:11,110
Someone already has.

535
00:53:11,449 --> 00:53:13,577
I suspected Jordan Pryce
might be the Joker...

536
00:53:13,786 --> 00:53:16,880
...but the Jokerz were on
your yacht trying to slag him.

537
00:53:17,088 --> 00:53:19,614
I got him off before
it was blasted to splinters.

538
00:53:22,893 --> 00:53:26,456
I think your little Robin's
turned into a bitter old crow.

539
00:53:26,666 --> 00:53:28,759
He's gotta be the brains
behind this new Joker.

540
00:53:28,967 --> 00:53:31,402
It's harsh,
but who else is there?

541
00:53:34,005 --> 00:53:35,405
Suit up.

542
00:53:35,675 --> 00:53:39,440
Take the car and check it out.
I'll monitor you from here.

543
00:53:40,545 --> 00:53:42,739
What happened to
leaving it to the cops?

544
00:53:43,382 --> 00:53:44,474
Not their game.

545
00:53:44,983 --> 00:53:47,384
There's something else
I want to take with me.

546
00:54:11,844 --> 00:54:14,608
Drake, I know you're
the connection to the Joker.

547
00:54:17,315 --> 00:54:19,409
Don't pretend you
didn't hear me.

548
00:54:20,052 --> 00:54:21,210
Hologram.

549
00:54:35,568 --> 00:54:37,592
You guessed it,
Batfake!

550
00:54:37,802 --> 00:54:41,260
The disgruntled Mr. Drake
is indeed in my employ.

551
00:54:41,907 --> 00:54:46,844
Took him a few years, but he figured
out who ran the real winning team.

552
00:54:47,079 --> 00:54:50,606
This is one of Uncle Sam's
orbiting defense satellites.

553
00:54:50,815 --> 00:54:53,284
Hyperion class,
laser-armed.

554
00:54:53,485 --> 00:54:56,420
Handy litlle gadget for shooting down
unfriendly missiles...

555
00:54:56,621 --> 00:54:59,021
...or giving someone
a world-class hotfoot.

556
00:55:01,460 --> 00:55:04,724
Think of it as urban tagging
on a grand scale...

557
00:55:04,931 --> 00:55:09,833
...reminding all and sundry
that this is Joker territory.

558
00:55:10,036 --> 00:55:12,094
You're welcome to
try and stop us...

559
00:55:12,304 --> 00:55:16,400
...but I'm not taking bets on that
happening anytime soon. Toodles.

560
00:56:10,262 --> 00:56:11,456
Miss me?

561
00:56:20,606 --> 00:56:22,902
Computer, search for
the name Jolly Jack.

562
00:56:28,581 --> 00:56:31,744
Abandoned candy factory.
Just his style.

563
00:56:31,951 --> 00:56:33,577
Wayne,
I think I've got something.

564
00:56:33,853 --> 00:56:36,947
Download this transmition and tell Gordon
to have her men at that address.

565
00:56:37,155 --> 00:56:40,090
-I'm gonna--
-Aren't you the nasty tattletale?

566
00:56:40,291 --> 00:56:43,556
Ratting me out
before I have my fun.

567
00:56:43,762 --> 00:56:45,492
Papa spank.

568
00:57:04,449 --> 00:57:05,438
Yeah,
I know!

569
00:57:50,427 --> 00:57:53,396
I'd better sit down
before I bust a gut!

570
00:57:54,063 --> 00:57:56,190
Catch you later,
kiddo!

571
00:58:00,170 --> 00:58:02,797
It's stopped.
I'm going after him.

572
00:58:25,027 --> 00:58:26,255
Gotcha!

573
00:58:49,585 --> 00:58:50,813
Ace.

574
00:59:02,931 --> 00:59:04,489
Good bat-dog.

575
00:59:14,742 --> 00:59:15,971
Where'd he go?

576
00:59:20,748 --> 00:59:21,909
Watch it!

577
00:59:22,117 --> 00:59:23,447
You watch it!

578
00:59:25,621 --> 00:59:26,918
It's him!

579
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:47,739
Double down.

580
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:07,827
Lovely playroom.
You getting this, Wayne?

581
01:00:08,262 --> 01:00:11,164
I see it. You keep
your eyes open for the Joker.

582
01:00:21,777 --> 01:00:22,766
Tim.

583
01:00:23,512 --> 01:00:25,103
Get up, Drake.

584
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:28,373
What?
Who is it?

585
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:30,016
Where's the Joker?

586
01:00:30,318 --> 01:00:31,306
Joker?

587
01:00:31,518 --> 01:00:34,353
Drop the act.
I know you're working with him.

588
01:00:34,722 --> 01:00:38,181
No, Joker's gone.
I don't know where he is, really.

589
01:00:38,793 --> 01:00:41,786
Suit sensors aren't picking up
any pulse fluctuations.

590
01:00:42,164 --> 01:00:43,289
It's the truth.

591
01:00:43,731 --> 01:00:47,030
I don't do this anymore.
I have a home and family.

592
01:00:47,235 --> 01:00:50,967
I gave this up years ago.
Kids' stuff. That's all it was.

593
01:00:51,806 --> 01:00:54,367
It may be the truth,
but he's still whacked.

594
01:00:54,710 --> 01:00:58,146
Fun and games.
Boy Wonder playing the hero.

595
01:00:58,347 --> 01:01:01,338
Fighting the bad guys
and no one ever gets....

596
01:01:01,849 --> 01:01:03,646
Oh, God.

597
01:01:04,186 --> 01:01:05,813
I killed him.

598
01:01:06,288 --> 01:01:08,016
I didn't mean to.

599
01:01:08,222 --> 01:01:09,985
I tried so hard to forget.

600
01:01:10,291 --> 01:01:14,318
But I still hear the shot,
still see his dead smile.

601
01:01:15,030 --> 01:01:16,860
Every night the
dreams get stronger.

602
01:01:17,065 --> 01:01:19,659
He's there when I sleep,
whispering, laughing...

603
01:01:19,867 --> 01:01:22,835
...telling me I'm just as bad
as he is, we're both the same.

604
01:01:23,172 --> 01:01:24,934
I'm calling an ambulance.

605
01:01:25,139 --> 01:01:27,630
No, I'm all right.
Forgive me, Terry.

606
01:01:27,842 --> 01:01:31,643
Old, nasty memories twisting
inside me like bad oysters.

607
01:01:31,847 --> 01:01:32,835
Nothing really.

608
01:01:33,347 --> 01:01:35,179
I'm perfectly fine now.

609
01:01:35,384 --> 01:01:36,681
How do you know my name?

610
01:01:37,186 --> 01:01:40,621
There's nothing about you
I don't know, Batfake.

611
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:46,722
Terry!

612
01:01:48,463 --> 01:01:50,192
Have a time-out,
kid.

613
01:01:50,398 --> 01:01:52,992
Can't let you spoil
the party too soon.

614
01:01:53,202 --> 01:01:57,797
And Bruce, I'm sure you've got
your monkey-boy wired somehow.

615
01:01:58,507 --> 01:02:02,534
That's just peachy, because I want you
to see every minute of this.

616
01:02:02,744 --> 01:02:04,041
It's a killer.

617
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:23,724
My God.

618
01:02:27,635 --> 01:02:30,900
Oh,
I never get tired of that!

619
01:02:31,273 --> 01:02:32,262
Drake?

620
01:02:32,806 --> 01:02:34,672
You're the Joker?

621
01:02:34,943 --> 01:02:39,311
That flabby oaf doesn't even realize
I'm using him as a time-share.

622
01:02:39,514 --> 01:02:43,746
Beneath this puckish exterior
lies the mind of a genius...

623
01:02:43,952 --> 01:02:45,510
...years ahead of my time.

624
01:02:45,853 --> 01:02:48,721
In the weeks young Robin
was under my tutelage...

625
01:02:48,922 --> 01:02:53,452
...l used him as the subject
of my greatest experiment.

626
01:02:53,661 --> 01:02:56,652
Utilizing cutting-edge
genetics technology...

627
01:02:56,864 --> 01:02:58,764
...which I had pinched
here and there...

628
01:02:58,967 --> 01:03:02,333
...l encoded my DNA
on a microchip...

629
01:03:02,536 --> 01:03:05,438
...and set it
into bird-boy's birdbrain.

630
01:03:05,907 --> 01:03:07,398
Here.

631
01:03:07,608 --> 01:03:12,204
Everything that was me has been
a-sleeping all comfy and cozy...

632
01:03:12,414 --> 01:03:15,280
...inside Tim
Drake's subconscious.

633
01:03:15,550 --> 01:03:19,543
At first, I had to limit the time
I spent in Drake's body.

634
01:03:19,755 --> 01:03:21,449
He's not aware of what I do...

635
01:03:21,657 --> 01:03:24,556
...chalking up any lingering memories
to bad dreams.

636
01:03:24,826 --> 01:03:28,090
If his family misses him,
I simply call wifey and tell her:

637
01:03:28,297 --> 01:03:30,458
"l'm working late,
honey."

638
01:03:30,731 --> 01:03:32,699
The changes come at will now...

639
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:37,099
...and soon I'll be strong enough
to live in this body permanently.

640
01:03:37,306 --> 01:03:40,172
Mr. J's on the rebound,
baby!

641
01:03:40,375 --> 01:03:44,402
My comeback party's gonna set
the whole town on fire!

642
01:04:07,034 --> 01:04:09,434
So where should I
make ground zero?

643
01:04:09,637 --> 01:04:13,869
Gotham General, where our hero's
dear little Dana is recuperating?

644
01:04:14,076 --> 01:04:18,536
Or here, in the happy garden
of Mrs. Mary McGinnis?

645
01:04:20,514 --> 01:04:23,780
I always think it adds resonance
to a hero's mission...

646
01:04:23,985 --> 01:04:27,148
...to have some defining element
of tragedy in his background...

647
01:04:27,356 --> 01:04:28,721
...don't you?

648
01:04:29,724 --> 01:04:33,092
Ah, but the one and only
kick off point...

649
01:04:33,295 --> 01:04:36,128
...must be stately Wayne Manor.

650
01:04:36,498 --> 01:04:37,556
Gone in a flash...

651
01:04:37,766 --> 01:04:42,168
...before Brucie can hobble to safety
or mount a rescue.

652
01:04:42,371 --> 01:04:43,632
Don't worry,
though.

653
01:04:46,574 --> 01:04:49,873
I'll be hitting
those other spots soon enough.

654
01:04:50,878 --> 01:04:52,436
Adiós, Brucie.

655
01:04:52,646 --> 01:04:56,014
I guess I should salute you
as a worthy adversary and all that...

656
01:04:56,217 --> 01:05:00,518
...but the truth is,
I really did hate your guts.

657
01:05:02,324 --> 01:05:06,818
What about it, kid?
Any last words for the old Batfart?

658
01:05:07,429 --> 01:05:09,556
Yeah. Sic him.

659
01:05:15,670 --> 01:05:17,228
Ace, here!

660
01:05:20,909 --> 01:05:22,170
Attaboy!

661
01:05:34,989 --> 01:05:37,686
End of the line,
Snoopy.

662
01:05:43,864 --> 01:05:44,695
No!

663
01:06:00,014 --> 01:06:01,539
Oh, good.

664
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:03,411
The beam's headed here.

665
01:06:03,617 --> 01:06:06,177
Now I'll have
to start all over again.

666
01:06:06,387 --> 01:06:09,585
Thanks for wrecking everything, kid.
See you around.

667
01:06:10,092 --> 01:06:11,389
Hold it.

668
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:13,791
Oh, wise up,
junior.

669
01:06:13,994 --> 01:06:15,393
Game's over!

670
01:06:15,597 --> 01:06:18,121
-I'm taking you in.
-Right.

671
01:06:24,905 --> 01:06:26,965
You're out of your league,
McGinnis.

672
01:06:27,175 --> 01:06:31,737
I know every trick the original
Batman and Robin knew at their peak.

673
01:06:32,481 --> 01:06:35,143
Maybe, but you don't know
a thing about me.

674
01:06:35,382 --> 01:06:36,407
You?

675
01:06:36,617 --> 01:06:38,552
What's to know?
You're a punk.

676
01:06:38,753 --> 01:06:40,344
A rank amateur.

677
01:06:40,554 --> 01:06:44,820
A costumed errand boy taking orders
from a senile old man.

678
01:06:45,025 --> 01:06:48,119
Still, if it's a whooping
you're wanting....

679
01:06:49,431 --> 01:06:52,831
That's right.
Better to run and save yourself.

680
01:06:53,034 --> 01:06:55,331
That's about your speed.

681
01:06:57,005 --> 01:06:59,132
Let's dance,
bozo.

682
01:07:14,722 --> 01:07:16,748
He's tough.
Any suggestions, boss?

683
01:07:16,958 --> 01:07:20,291
Joker is vain and likes to talk and try
to distract you, but don't listen.

684
01:07:20,494 --> 01:07:22,190
Block it out and power through.

685
01:07:22,396 --> 01:07:23,420
Wait.

686
01:07:23,632 --> 01:07:25,065
I like to talk too.

687
01:07:28,369 --> 01:07:30,702
-What are you doing?
-Fighting dirty.

688
01:07:30,905 --> 01:07:33,170
The real Batman would never--

689
01:07:33,574 --> 01:07:35,735
Told you,
you didn't know me.

690
01:07:37,913 --> 01:07:40,074
Funny guy.

691
01:07:40,447 --> 01:07:41,847
Can't say the same for you.

692
01:07:43,851 --> 01:07:47,413
Impudent brat.
Who do you think you're talking to?

693
01:07:47,789 --> 01:07:49,518
Not a comedian,
I'll tell ya that.

694
01:07:50,925 --> 01:07:52,018
Shut your mouth!

695
01:07:53,561 --> 01:07:56,360
The real Batman never
talked to you much, did he?

696
01:07:56,565 --> 01:07:58,862
That's why you were
so fixated on him.

697
01:08:00,367 --> 01:08:03,393
Don't play psychoanalyst
with me, boy!

698
01:08:03,771 --> 01:08:06,400
Oh, I don't need a degree
to figure you out.

699
01:08:09,277 --> 01:08:10,800
The real reason
you kept coming back...

700
01:08:11,012 --> 01:08:13,708
...was you never got a laugh
out of the old man.

701
01:08:14,047 --> 01:08:15,880
I'm not hearing this.

702
01:08:16,083 --> 01:08:18,951
Get a clue, clownie.
He's got no sense of humor.

703
01:08:19,152 --> 01:08:21,849
He wouldn't know a good joke
if it bit him in the cape.

704
01:08:22,224 --> 01:08:25,716
-Not that you ever had a good joke.
-Shut up. Shut up!

705
01:08:25,926 --> 01:08:28,520
I mean, joy buzzers,
squirting flowers? Lame!

706
01:08:28,729 --> 01:08:32,664
Where's the A material? Make a
face, drop your pants, something!

707
01:08:32,867 --> 01:08:34,230
Show yourself!

708
01:08:34,435 --> 01:08:38,304
You make me laugh, but only because
I think you're kind of pathetic.

709
01:08:40,541 --> 01:08:42,030
Stop that!

710
01:08:43,610 --> 01:08:46,273
You fell in a tank of acid,
got your skin bleached...

711
01:08:46,479 --> 01:08:48,448
...then decided
to become a super villain.

712
01:08:48,649 --> 01:08:51,675
What? You couldn't get work
as a rodeo clown?

713
01:08:54,988 --> 01:08:56,617
Don't you dare laugh at me!

714
01:08:59,225 --> 01:09:02,457
Why? I thought the Joker always
wanted to make Batman laugh.

715
01:09:02,895 --> 01:09:04,386
You're not Batman!

716
01:09:31,157 --> 01:09:32,646
Come on,
McGinnis!

717
01:09:32,858 --> 01:09:36,293
Laugh it up now,
you miserable little punk! Laugh!

718
01:09:37,662 --> 01:09:40,597
I can't hear you!

719
01:10:12,064 --> 01:10:13,360
Easy,
I've got you.

720
01:10:23,542 --> 01:10:24,600
Way ahead of you.

721
01:11:17,695 --> 01:11:21,029
Delia and Deidre Dennis,
your grandmother's paid your bail.

722
01:11:21,233 --> 01:11:23,564
You're being released to her custody,
pending your trial.

723
01:11:23,769 --> 01:11:25,963
-Oh.
-Joy.

724
01:11:29,140 --> 01:11:30,971
You rotten little scamps!

725
01:11:31,176 --> 01:11:35,670
I struggle to make a good home for you
and this is the thanks I get!

726
01:11:36,814 --> 01:11:38,338
Break a grandmother's heart!

727
01:11:38,550 --> 01:11:42,987
-I hope they throw the book at you!
-Oh, shut up, Nana Harley.

728
01:11:47,158 --> 01:11:49,127
You didn't have
to cover up for me, Barbara.

729
01:11:49,461 --> 01:11:53,328
The Joker's gone, Tim.
You were just along for the ride.

730
01:11:54,966 --> 01:11:56,161
How are you,
Mr. Drake?

731
01:11:56,368 --> 01:11:58,359
Tim,
this is Terry McGinnis.

732
01:11:58,569 --> 01:12:01,198
-We met the other night.
-We did?

733
01:12:04,042 --> 01:12:05,533
I owe you big time.

734
01:12:06,078 --> 01:12:07,136
Forget it.

735
01:12:07,345 --> 01:12:11,543
For what it's worth, Bruce couldn't have
chosen anyone better to put on the mask.

736
01:12:12,583 --> 01:12:15,144
Coming from you,
that means everything.

737
01:12:15,988 --> 01:12:19,150
Sometimes the important things
go unsaid.

738
01:12:19,490 --> 01:12:22,789
If there's one thing I've learned you've got
to appreciate the people in your life...

739
01:12:22,994 --> 01:12:24,484
...while you have the chance.

740
01:12:24,963 --> 01:12:27,728
Not everyone is capable
of expressing that, Tim.

741
01:12:27,932 --> 01:12:30,730
No matter how much
they might feel it in their heart.

742
01:12:31,203 --> 01:12:32,500
I know.

743
01:12:36,774 --> 01:12:37,832
What are you doing here?

744
01:12:38,143 --> 01:12:39,837
It's where I should be.

745
01:12:43,247 --> 01:12:44,237
Terry.

746
01:12:45,850 --> 01:12:48,512
I've been thinking about
what you once told me.

747
01:12:49,454 --> 01:12:50,581
You were wrong.

748
01:12:51,590 --> 01:12:53,854
It's not Batman
that makes you worthwhile.

749
01:12:55,094 --> 01:12:57,028
It's the other way around.

750
01:12:57,429 --> 01:12:59,761
Never tell yourself
anything different.

751
01:13:00,932 --> 01:13:02,229
Thanks.

752
01:13:10,074 --> 01:13:11,474
Hello, Tim.

753
01:13:12,778 --> 01:13:14,506
Hi, old man.
