1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:01:06,651 --> 00:01:09,195
This van is kind
of weirding me out.

3
00:01:09,279 --> 00:01:11,239
This van and the weed
is freaking me out.

4
00:01:11,322 --> 00:01:12,449
I feel like I'm
on another planet.

5
00:01:12,532 --> 00:01:13,867
I don't know,
I like Marty's van.

6
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,703
You know, it's like
a cozy cocaine mansion.

7
00:01:17,704 --> 00:01:19,789
You know I met this
dude like five times?

8
00:01:19,873 --> 00:01:21,624
Marty still does not
remember my name.

9
00:01:21,708 --> 00:01:23,084
Yeah, where'd you
find that guy?

10
00:01:23,168 --> 00:01:26,212
He manages the casino
where I won
the pai-gow tournament.

11
00:01:27,505 --> 00:01:28,715
Pai-gow.

12
00:01:28,798 --> 00:01:30,592
Hold on.
Pai-gow.

13
00:01:30,675 --> 00:01:32,035
Tracy's coming to
pick us up, so...

14
00:01:32,051 --> 00:01:33,303
Hold on a second.

15
00:01:33,386 --> 00:01:35,722
Did you just
invite your fiancée
to your bachelor party?

16
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,390
Is that the
cool thing to do?
No.

17
00:01:37,474 --> 00:01:38,475
Did we just witness that?

18
00:01:38,558 --> 00:01:39,601
I didn't...
No, I mean...

19
00:01:39,684 --> 00:01:41,728
Uh... Well,
all the bars are closed

20
00:01:41,811 --> 00:01:43,980
and our
designated driver's like

21
00:01:44,063 --> 00:01:46,232
passed out in the back.
I thought...

22
00:01:46,316 --> 00:01:47,796
I thought it was over.
Is it not over?

23
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:50,111
Well, let us celebrate
the brief moments

24
00:01:50,195 --> 00:01:51,946
that we have left
with each other, huh?

25
00:01:52,322 --> 00:01:55,074
Here's to the three of us.
Friends for life.

26
00:01:56,034 --> 00:01:57,243
Thanks, guys.

27
00:01:57,327 --> 00:01:59,367
- This was an awesome night.
- I will drink to that.

28
00:01:59,621 --> 00:02:01,289
Hey, uh,
you guys...

29
00:02:01,372 --> 00:02:03,541
You guys think I'm, like,
doing the right thing, right?

30
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:05,084
Like marrying...

31
00:02:05,168 --> 00:02:06,586
Marrying Tracy?

32
00:02:11,382 --> 00:02:12,509
Are you happy?

33
00:02:13,593 --> 00:02:14,719
Mmm-hmm.

34
00:02:14,803 --> 00:02:18,056
If you were happy,
would you even
ask that question?

35
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:20,475
Well, it's not
necessarily...

36
00:02:20,558 --> 00:02:23,038
I mean, marriage can
be scary, even if you
found the right girl.

37
00:02:23,061 --> 00:02:24,395
Yeah, but you're
scared of everything.

38
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:27,273
You won't even ask out
the attractive girl
who works at your office.

39
00:02:27,357 --> 00:02:28,733
We work together.

40
00:02:28,817 --> 00:02:30,985
So did Siegfried and Roy.
And look at them.

41
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:33,488
One of them got mauled
by a white tiger.

42
00:02:33,571 --> 00:02:34,906
It was a wildebeest.

43
00:02:35,448 --> 00:02:37,033
They don't do
a wildebeest show.

44
00:02:38,243 --> 00:02:40,245
Whatever you decide,
that is your decision.

45
00:02:40,328 --> 00:02:41,329
Wait,
hold on, hold on.

46
00:02:41,412 --> 00:02:44,666
It's not his decision.
It's our decision.

47
00:02:44,749 --> 00:02:46,125
What?
It is.

48
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:47,209
That's what you said.

49
00:02:47,252 --> 00:02:49,629
We all have veto power
over each other's girls.

50
00:02:49,712 --> 00:02:51,631
Oh, no, I said that
when I was nine.

51
00:02:51,714 --> 00:02:52,924
I was a 9-year-old boy.

52
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:54,551
We made a pact.

53
00:02:54,634 --> 00:02:57,303
I don't know,
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have
brought all this stuff up.

54
00:02:57,387 --> 00:02:59,430
No, dude.
You wanna make
a pros and cons list?

55
00:02:59,514 --> 00:03:00,765
Huh?

56
00:03:00,849 --> 00:03:02,100
Okay. Uh...

57
00:03:02,809 --> 00:03:04,435
- I love her.
- That's a pro.

58
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:05,562
I'm happy.

59
00:03:05,645 --> 00:03:06,980
Okay,
we're ahead of the game.

60
00:03:07,063 --> 00:03:09,482
Cons would be
she eats slow.

61
00:03:10,817 --> 00:03:12,902
She just chews so slow.

62
00:03:12,986 --> 00:03:15,572
"She chews slow"?
That's the biggest
con you have?

63
00:03:15,655 --> 00:03:18,700
I mean, three-hour dinners
for the rest of your life.

64
00:03:18,783 --> 00:03:21,160
And I just
sort of have to

65
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:25,957
change my old self in
order to be my new self.
You know?

66
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,334
That's part of the thing.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

67
00:03:28,418 --> 00:03:30,712
Are you saying that
you can't be yourself
around Tracy?

68
00:03:30,795 --> 00:03:32,672
Ugh, that's
coming out wrong. No.

69
00:03:32,755 --> 00:03:34,549
I can be myself.
It's not that
I can't be myself,

70
00:03:34,632 --> 00:03:38,052
I just sort of need to
kind of have this new self.

71
00:03:38,136 --> 00:03:40,638
You're either being
yourself or you're
not being yourself.

72
00:03:40,722 --> 00:03:42,724
I'm myself, okay, guys?

73
00:03:42,807 --> 00:03:44,183
It's just that I have to...

74
00:03:44,267 --> 00:03:45,560
You have to?

75
00:03:45,643 --> 00:03:48,146
I want to evolve

76
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:50,857
this old self
into a new self,

77
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,650
so the old self

78
00:03:53,943 --> 00:03:55,737
goes to sleep

79
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,448
and the new self
comes awake.

80
00:03:58,531 --> 00:04:01,826
And sometimes,
the new self is truer

81
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:04,162
than any of the other
old selves could be.

82
00:04:05,163 --> 00:04:06,956
Do you...

83
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,541
Do you do you
really wanna do this?

84
00:04:09,584 --> 00:04:11,961
Yes. Of course I do,
come on.

85
00:04:12,045 --> 00:04:14,005
I'm just high, man.
I'm just high.

86
00:04:14,631 --> 00:04:16,007
Forget I said any
of this stuff, okay?

87
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,634
I just wanted to
talk things through,

88
00:04:17,717 --> 00:04:21,262
you know, before
I jump off the bridge.

89
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:23,181
"Jump off the bridge"?

90
00:04:23,264 --> 00:04:24,474
Yeah, jump off the bridge.

91
00:04:24,557 --> 00:04:25,934
It's like a really
famous saying.

92
00:04:26,351 --> 00:04:28,478
Yeah, it does not pertain
to getting married.

93
00:04:28,561 --> 00:04:31,940
Mmm... I think you have that
mixed up, actually, but...

94
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:35,818
Hey, Tracy.

95
00:04:35,902 --> 00:04:37,612
Yeah, yeah,
I'm coming out.

96
00:04:37,695 --> 00:04:39,489
Uh... Coming out.

97
00:04:39,572 --> 00:04:40,573
- Did you just hear that?
- Yeah.

98
00:04:40,657 --> 00:04:43,368
He just equated
getting married to suicide.

99
00:04:43,451 --> 00:04:45,870
No, I think he's having
jitters or something.

100
00:04:45,995 --> 00:04:47,455
That's not the jitters.

101
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:49,916
She's a good person.
She's mean to waiters.

102
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:52,543
She had hot coffee
burned on her
bare legs by that guy.

103
00:04:52,961 --> 00:04:54,963
- Hey, guys.
- Hey!

104
00:04:55,046 --> 00:04:56,297
There she is!

105
00:04:56,381 --> 00:04:57,966
How much weed did you smoke?

106
00:04:58,049 --> 00:04:59,217
All of it.

107
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,302
You guys excited
about the wedding?

108
00:05:01,386 --> 00:05:02,845
Yeah!
Oh, yeah.

109
00:05:02,929 --> 00:05:04,138
Yeah. Jump off...
Yeah. Jumping off...

110
00:05:04,222 --> 00:05:06,142
Jumping off that bridge.
Jumping off that bridge.

111
00:06:11,122 --> 00:06:12,415
Okay,
time to go, man.

112
00:06:12,498 --> 00:06:14,792
It's time to go.
I've been sitting
here a long time.

113
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:16,961
And what are we
doing here, man?
I gotta go.

114
00:06:17,045 --> 00:06:18,963
Just let me hang out
and think for a second.

115
00:06:19,047 --> 00:06:21,257
We've been parked
here for an hour.

116
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,425
What would you do
if your best friend

117
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:24,886
was about to make
the biggest mistake
of his life?

118
00:06:24,969 --> 00:06:26,637
What, she's cheating on him?
What's happening?

119
00:06:26,721 --> 00:06:28,765
No, I just don't think
they should get married.

120
00:06:28,848 --> 00:06:29,849
We were all hanging out

121
00:06:29,932 --> 00:06:31,642
and he was talking
about the pros and cons,

122
00:06:31,726 --> 00:06:33,061
and, I mean,
it was mostly cons.

123
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:35,063
I don't know. I think
part of him wants me

124
00:06:35,146 --> 00:06:36,439
to go in there
and stop the wedding.

125
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:38,399
That's crazy, right?
Yeah, that's crazy.

126
00:06:38,816 --> 00:06:42,153
We were all high
in Marty's van when
we were talking about it.

127
00:06:42,653 --> 00:06:44,030
I don't know, man.

128
00:06:44,113 --> 00:06:45,448
Weed is truth.

129
00:06:46,407 --> 00:06:48,618
Weed is truth.

130
00:06:48,701 --> 00:06:50,953
Right? People get high
and they say some real shit.

131
00:06:51,329 --> 00:06:55,500
I wish my friends had told me
I was making a mistake
before my ceremony.

132
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,502
You wish your friends
had stopped you?

133
00:06:57,585 --> 00:07:00,630
Every day of my life.

134
00:07:00,713 --> 00:07:04,550
But we got married and then,
bing, bang, boom,
we have the children.

135
00:07:04,634 --> 00:07:08,137
Three small anchors
tethering me to
a ship that's sinking.

136
00:07:08,221 --> 00:07:10,598
Haunting me every day
from my kitchen.

137
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:12,100
Great kids.

138
00:07:12,183 --> 00:07:13,226
Jesus.

139
00:07:13,309 --> 00:07:15,228
The middle one
is extra fat.

140
00:07:15,311 --> 00:07:17,396
But everybody
makes a mistake, huh?

141
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,858
Sometimes, these mistakes,
they're for eternity.

142
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:28,074
<i>How many words would
it take to really say</i>

143
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:31,619
<i>How much you've</i>
<i>changed my life</i>
<i>in every single way?</i>

144
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:34,997
<i>You make the good stuff better
And the bad stuff, too</i>

145
00:07:35,081 --> 00:07:38,376
<i>Yeah, my life is better
'Cause I get to do it with you</i>

146
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,629
<i>Every night
when we eat dinner</i>

147
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:43,214
<i>I get to chew it with you</i>

148
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:46,259
<i>If we get sick,
I get to flu it with you</i>

149
00:07:46,342 --> 00:07:47,802
<i>And if we're
watching Green Card</i>

150
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:49,595
<i>I get to Depardieu it with you</i>

151
00:07:49,679 --> 00:07:50,805
<i>Yeah, my life is better...</i>

152
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:52,223
Everything okay?
What? Huh?

153
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:53,474
Yeah. Tux looks great.

154
00:07:53,558 --> 00:07:54,642
Oh, thanks, yeah.

155
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:57,103
It was my grandfather's.
He was Italian.

156
00:07:57,186 --> 00:07:59,564
He died in it.
Oh, okay.

157
00:07:59,647 --> 00:08:04,527
<i>Remember this vow
I will renew it with you</i>

158
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,070
<i>My life is better</i>

159
00:08:06,154 --> 00:08:09,407
<i>'Cause I get to
do it with you</i>

160
00:08:09,907 --> 00:08:12,243
Okay. Now
it's time for the good part.

161
00:08:12,368 --> 00:08:14,537
I believe you're
providing the rings?
Oh, yeah.

162
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,124
Got it.

163
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,168
Oops.

164
00:08:21,085 --> 00:08:23,880
I, Nardo, take you, Tracy...

165
00:08:24,255 --> 00:08:27,258
I, Nardo, take you, Tracy...

166
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:28,509
Stop!

167
00:08:30,803 --> 00:08:32,346
Stop!

168
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:33,973
Oh, shit!
What?

169
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:35,183
Stop the wedding! Stop!

170
00:08:35,266 --> 00:08:37,852
Please, stop the...
The wedding.

171
00:08:37,935 --> 00:08:39,020
I can't let you do this.

172
00:08:39,103 --> 00:08:40,271
Jason, don't!

173
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:42,023
I'm sorry,
but I have to.

174
00:08:42,106 --> 00:08:43,691
What is happening?

175
00:08:44,192 --> 00:08:45,318
Stay away
from my daughter.

176
00:08:45,401 --> 00:08:46,402
Who, Tracy?

177
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:49,197
Yuck. Gross.
I'm not here
because I love her.

178
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,364
I'm here
because I love him.

179
00:08:50,448 --> 00:08:51,490
Me?

180
00:08:52,283 --> 00:08:53,326
I knew it.

181
00:08:53,409 --> 00:08:55,578
No, Jared,
it's not a gay thing.

182
00:08:55,661 --> 00:08:56,662
God, what is with him?

183
00:08:56,746 --> 00:08:58,915
His bangs are longer
than his face.

184
00:08:58,998 --> 00:09:00,458
I know that
as I said that,

185
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,168
it did come out
kind of gay,

186
00:09:02,251 --> 00:09:03,878
but Nardo and I are
more than gay.

187
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:06,297
We're best friends.
And that goes for...
For Evan, too.

188
00:09:06,631 --> 00:09:07,673
Leave me out of this.

189
00:09:07,757 --> 00:09:08,757
Hey, hey, Jason.

190
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:10,760
Jason, you cannot
do this right now.

191
00:09:10,843 --> 00:09:13,012
Evan and I love you
too much to let you
go through with this.

192
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:14,180
Leave me out of this!

193
00:09:14,263 --> 00:09:15,303
What the hell is going on?

194
00:09:15,348 --> 00:09:17,850
I'm sorry, Tracy,
I wanted to say this earlier.

195
00:09:17,934 --> 00:09:19,534
You know, before
your family got involved

196
00:09:19,602 --> 00:09:21,604
and Jesus was here.

197
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:24,148
I didn't realize
this is way more awkward

198
00:09:24,232 --> 00:09:25,441
than I thought
it was gonna be.

199
00:09:25,524 --> 00:09:27,318
I thought that some
people would agree.

200
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:29,820
Not that you would
carry me out on your
shoulders or anything,

201
00:09:29,904 --> 00:09:32,615
but you guys have really
left me hanging here.

202
00:09:33,115 --> 00:09:34,367
This is really...

203
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:35,868
This is a toughie.

204
00:09:35,952 --> 00:09:37,411
But... But the point is

205
00:09:37,495 --> 00:09:38,829
that she is not
the one for him.

206
00:09:38,913 --> 00:09:39,914
You said it yourself.

207
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:41,517
No, I did not.
I did not say that!
What?

208
00:09:41,624 --> 00:09:43,709
I never said that!
Yes, you did,
in Marty's van!

209
00:09:43,793 --> 00:09:45,419
I don't even remember
Marty's van.

210
00:09:45,503 --> 00:09:46,754
I was high in Marty's van.

211
00:09:46,837 --> 00:09:47,880
I was high in Marty's van!

212
00:09:47,964 --> 00:09:50,216
A lot of chronic
was being passed.

213
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:51,979
Grammy, I'm sorry.
I don't smoke that crap.

214
00:09:52,343 --> 00:09:53,623
It's medical.
I don't smoke crap.

215
00:09:53,678 --> 00:09:54,971
You know what?
If anything,

216
00:09:55,054 --> 00:09:58,683
Nardo was just going
over the pros and cons
of you as a person.

217
00:09:58,766 --> 00:10:00,526
You can be a little,
you know...
You eat slow.

218
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:02,103
It's not a big deal.
We were just talking.

219
00:10:02,186 --> 00:10:03,688
It was just guys
kind of gabbing...

220
00:10:03,771 --> 00:10:05,064
It was just guy talk.
Guy talk, guy talk.

221
00:10:05,147 --> 00:10:06,524
Stop, stop, stop, stop!
He's always
apologizing.

222
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:08,276
You need to work on that.
He's always doing
something wrong.

223
00:10:08,359 --> 00:10:09,777
Stop it! Stop it!

224
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,320
Okay, this is not what
I think. We're just...

225
00:10:11,404 --> 00:10:13,124
We're gonna go along
with the wedding, okay?

226
00:10:13,197 --> 00:10:14,740
We're gonna do the wedding,
okay?

227
00:10:14,824 --> 00:10:16,284
Nothing can stop us now.
We're...

228
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:21,163
Tracy!

229
00:10:21,289 --> 00:10:22,290
Tracy!

230
00:10:23,374 --> 00:10:24,875
Well, this is dangerous.

231
00:10:25,293 --> 00:10:26,794
That's why that happened.

232
00:10:27,295 --> 00:10:29,046
Everybody smokes weed.

233
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:30,172
Tracy!

234
00:10:30,256 --> 00:10:31,924
Don't even
speak to me, Evan.

235
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:33,801
Tracy, wait,
don't leave!
You know what?

236
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:35,761
I knew you guys
never liked me.

237
00:10:36,512 --> 00:10:38,806
But I never thought
you were gonna ruin my life.

238
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:39,932
Tracy, I was just trying to...
You know what?

239
00:10:40,016 --> 00:10:42,101
We got the chapel till 6:00.
Why don't the three
of you guys

240
00:10:42,184 --> 00:10:43,602
just go ahead
and marry each other?

241
00:10:43,686 --> 00:10:45,896
Can we do that?
Because that
would be hilarious.

242
00:10:46,272 --> 00:10:47,815
I'm kidding. Obviously.

243
00:10:47,898 --> 00:10:49,233
Fuck you.

244
00:10:50,151 --> 00:10:52,028
- You're the worst.
- Tracy...

245
00:10:53,237 --> 00:10:54,989
Champagne?
Yes, thank you.

246
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:57,158
You want one?
No, I'm good. Thank you.

247
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,452
Thank you.

248
00:11:08,544 --> 00:11:09,587
Here, let me talk to him.

249
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,839
Oh, yeah, 'cause clearly
you can handle things
appropriately.

250
00:11:11,922 --> 00:11:14,342
Hey, buddy. Look,
I know you're upset now,

251
00:11:14,425 --> 00:11:16,427
but it's gonna get better.

252
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:17,928
It's like your
first day of rehab.

253
00:11:18,012 --> 00:11:20,252
It's hard to walk around
the Bellagio
sipping Coke Zero...

254
00:11:20,264 --> 00:11:22,016
Would you
shut the fuck up?

255
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:24,352
I wanted to get married,
you asshole!

256
00:11:24,435 --> 00:11:25,436
What about in the van?

257
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,480
I don't even
remember that, okay?

258
00:11:27,563 --> 00:11:29,065
I was fucking high.

259
00:11:29,148 --> 00:11:30,900
Yeah, but maybe
that was the point.

260
00:11:30,983 --> 00:11:34,028
That Marty's
sweet-ass van grass
was bringing out the truth,

261
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:35,237
that you don't
really wanna do this.

262
00:11:35,321 --> 00:11:36,801
So I was going over
the pros and cons,

263
00:11:37,073 --> 00:11:38,074
that's normal.

264
00:11:38,157 --> 00:11:41,035
Everyone has cons, Jason.
I have cons.

265
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:43,037
You are made of cons!

266
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,663
I've accepted Tracy's cons.

267
00:11:44,747 --> 00:11:45,873
I love Tracy's cons.

268
00:11:45,956 --> 00:11:48,709
And...
And now you've... You've...
You've ruined everything!

269
00:11:48,793 --> 00:11:49,794
Hey, dumb fuck,

270
00:11:49,877 --> 00:11:52,380
how come you couldn't have
had this conversation
before the wedding?

271
00:11:52,463 --> 00:11:53,463
I did, Evan,

272
00:11:53,506 --> 00:11:54,673
I talked about this
last week!

273
00:11:54,757 --> 00:11:55,757
And what did he say?

274
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,000
He said he
wanted to marry her.

275
00:11:57,009 --> 00:11:58,135
Okay, so what does
that say to you?

276
00:11:58,219 --> 00:11:59,303
It tells me
that he's wrong!

277
00:11:59,387 --> 00:12:00,763
Tracy isn't
the one for him!

278
00:12:00,846 --> 00:12:02,056
Yes, she is!

279
00:12:04,642 --> 00:12:05,643
Fucking dick!

280
00:12:54,358 --> 00:12:56,694
What's the point
of anything anymore?

281
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,029
Of all of it?

282
00:12:59,113 --> 00:13:00,656
All of life?

283
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:03,617
A stake has been
driven through my heart.

284
00:13:03,701 --> 00:13:04,702
Yeah.

285
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:08,205
You know, I was thinking,

286
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:10,791
why don't you
go after Tracy?

287
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:13,544
You love her, you know it.
Who cares what Jason thinks?

288
00:13:13,711 --> 00:13:16,172
It's too late, Evan.

289
00:13:16,255 --> 00:13:18,883
Oh, come on.
Nothing's too late.

290
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:20,509
It is.

291
00:13:20,593 --> 00:13:22,595
She's in Mexico.

292
00:13:22,678 --> 00:13:24,847
She is on our honeymoon

293
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,223
by herself.

294
00:13:27,183 --> 00:13:29,185
Tracy's in Mexico?
Uh-huh.

295
00:13:29,685 --> 00:13:32,563
And she took both
the plane tickets
with her.

296
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:35,483
I gotta go to work.

297
00:13:36,525 --> 00:13:38,402
But you're...
You're gonna be okay.

298
00:13:38,486 --> 00:13:41,322
Okay. Leave me.

299
00:13:41,405 --> 00:13:42,948
Leave me
like everybody else.

300
00:13:43,032 --> 00:13:46,118
You, Tracy,
the whole gang.

301
00:13:46,202 --> 00:13:48,829
I get it. I get it.

302
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:52,416
No one wants to be
around a loser.

303
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:54,293
I'm dirt.

304
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:55,586
You're not dirt.

305
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:58,005
Well, I'm garbage.
I'm something bad.

306
00:13:58,088 --> 00:13:59,924
You're not garbage.

307
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:02,301
I'm a dirty cum rag, Evan.

308
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:04,053
You know what that is?

309
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,892
I heard
your roommate pranked
your boy Nardo's wedding.

310
00:14:09,975 --> 00:14:12,061
I don't wanna
talk about that.

311
00:14:12,144 --> 00:14:13,424
Oh, come on.
Well, you know what?

312
00:14:13,479 --> 00:14:15,439
Your roommates are lame,
so you should just
move in with us.

313
00:14:15,523 --> 00:14:18,067
Wait, did he tell you about
the fact that everyone

314
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:21,111
has their own master bathroom?
With heated floors?

315
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:23,989
And what's fun is
sometimes we trade.
We use each other's bathrooms.

316
00:14:24,114 --> 00:14:25,658
That doesn't sound
like so much fun.
It's a rush.

317
00:14:25,741 --> 00:14:27,159
Yep.
It's a rush?

318
00:14:27,243 --> 00:14:28,702
Mmm-hmm. It's
something new. A new
bathroom every day.

319
00:14:28,786 --> 00:14:30,266
You find out stuff
about your friends.

320
00:14:30,454 --> 00:14:32,331
Have you ever had
a traditional Viking meal?

321
00:14:32,456 --> 00:14:34,496
I can't say
that I have, no.
You've never had a goose

322
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:38,087
shoved silly with venison
and elderberries and twigs

323
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:40,422
and all sorts of things
that are natural, man?

324
00:14:40,506 --> 00:14:41,507
Pudding?

325
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:42,716
You ever had pudding?

326
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,842
Isn't that hard to stuff?

327
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:45,386
Check out this brochure,
all right?

328
00:14:45,469 --> 00:14:46,804
I don't know. I...

329
00:14:46,971 --> 00:14:48,097
You know,
my roommates have been

330
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,265
my best friends
since third grade,

331
00:14:49,348 --> 00:14:51,850
and I know that people
don't understand them
that great,

332
00:14:51,934 --> 00:14:53,769
- but I love them.
- All right, shut up.

333
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:55,229
Here comes our future
shared girlfriend,

334
00:14:55,312 --> 00:14:56,772
so we'll talk
about this later.

335
00:14:56,897 --> 00:14:58,774
Act like a man.
Act like a man.
I am acting like a man.

336
00:14:58,857 --> 00:15:00,137
- I know, but act more...
- Evan.

337
00:15:01,235 --> 00:15:02,903
Can I borrow you
for a sec?
Yes. Yes.

338
00:15:02,987 --> 00:15:04,572
- Of course.
- Nice.

339
00:15:05,406 --> 00:15:06,490
Hi.

340
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:09,618
Hi.
Hey, what's up?
How are you?

341
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:11,245
Good.
Great,
that's good to hear.

342
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:12,496
Talk to you.

343
00:15:13,539 --> 00:15:15,249
Let's go?
Yes, yeah, sorry.

344
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:16,833
I'm glad you actually...

345
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:19,378
This is a workplace,
keep it professional.

346
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:20,462
Or don't.

347
00:15:22,214 --> 00:15:23,716
I'm glad you
actually grabbed me,

348
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:24,758
because I wanted to
talk to you.

349
00:15:24,842 --> 00:15:26,343
I know we work
together, but...
Listen, listen!

350
00:15:26,427 --> 00:15:28,220
MacDonaldson really
likes your stuff.

351
00:15:28,304 --> 00:15:29,344
What?
When did he say that?

352
00:15:29,388 --> 00:15:31,640
In the department meeting.
He wants to see you, now.

353
00:15:32,057 --> 00:15:33,851
I'm not even
close to ready. I...

354
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:35,974
This is a good thing.
Just watch,
do this, do this...

355
00:15:38,897 --> 00:15:40,899
Shake it out.
All right, shake it out.
I'll shake it out,

356
00:15:41,025 --> 00:15:42,276
but I'm not gonna
do that thing...
Relax.

357
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:43,819
Your neck is tense.
My neck is tense?

358
00:15:43,902 --> 00:15:45,862
Well, I mean... I'm not...
You put me on the spot.

359
00:15:45,863 --> 00:15:47,197
Get it together.

360
00:15:47,865 --> 00:15:49,533
You're gonna blow it, dude.

361
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:51,285
What?
Just kidding.

362
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,661
Okay.

363
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:57,666
I love the work
you've done here.

364
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,502
I think you and I should
present this together
tomorrow.

365
00:16:00,586 --> 00:16:02,379
Really? That's great.

366
00:16:02,838 --> 00:16:05,257
I think you're
ready to move to
the industrial side.

367
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:06,550
Tell me,

368
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:08,802
how would you like to
steam with me tomorrow?

369
00:16:08,886 --> 00:16:10,721
Say, 8:00 a.m.?
Steam?

370
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:12,139
Steam.

371
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:14,642
You know what steaming
with me means,
I take it?

372
00:16:14,725 --> 00:16:15,809
Yeah, yeah.

373
00:16:15,893 --> 00:16:18,771
It means
we'll both be naked.

374
00:16:31,784 --> 00:16:33,327
Well, that is part of it.

375
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:38,582
What...
What is the other part?

376
00:16:40,626 --> 00:16:42,878
<i>Excuse me.</i>
<i>There's a John McClane</i>
<i>here to see you, Evan.</i>

377
00:16:42,961 --> 00:16:44,713
<i>About the Nakatomi deal?</i>

378
00:16:44,797 --> 00:16:45,881
Nakatomi deal?

379
00:16:47,174 --> 00:16:48,425
Who's John McClane?

380
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:50,344
Um...

381
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:53,597
It's just
this side opportunity
I've been exploring.

382
00:16:53,681 --> 00:16:55,391
Could you tell him
that I'm busy right now

383
00:16:55,474 --> 00:16:56,634
and that I need
a few minutes?

384
00:16:56,684 --> 00:16:57,726
<i>I tried.</i>

385
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:59,269
<i>He said it's urgent.</i>

386
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:01,855
I'm sorry, sir.
Don't be.

387
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:03,023
I like the hustle.

388
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:04,858
Go on, get after it.

389
00:17:06,694 --> 00:17:07,861
Short meeting.

390
00:17:07,945 --> 00:17:09,029
Huh? Oh, I was paged.

391
00:17:09,113 --> 00:17:11,323
Paged? Paged by who?

392
00:17:11,407 --> 00:17:13,367
Uh... No one.
John McClane.

393
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,994
Hmm... Bad cop with
a heart of gold?
Tortured by his past?

394
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:17,871
You were paged by
the movie <i>Die Hard?</i>

395
00:17:17,955 --> 00:17:18,956
I guess so.

396
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,041
So, what happened
with MacDonaldson?

397
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:23,460
I don't know.
He asked me to
steam with him.

398
00:17:23,544 --> 00:17:25,421
No way!
That's awesome, Evan.

399
00:17:25,504 --> 00:17:26,505
Why?

400
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:29,133
He always steams with
people he's gonna promote.

401
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:32,219
He likes to seal the deal
with an old-fashioned
handshake at the club.

402
00:17:32,302 --> 00:17:34,680
So, I got the promotion?

403
00:17:34,763 --> 00:17:37,057
As long as you show up there
and shake his hand, yes.

404
00:17:37,141 --> 00:17:38,142
This is huge!

405
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:40,894
Fucking piece of
shit peach tea!

406
00:17:40,978 --> 00:17:42,396
Please, peach tea.

407
00:17:42,855 --> 00:17:43,856
Shit.

408
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:46,503
Did you know your
Snapples won't open?

409
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:48,277
No, I didn't hear that.

410
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,403
Oh, hey.

411
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:50,487
Can you open this?

412
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:52,656
You have no idea
how much we've heard
about this outfit.

413
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,741
What?

414
00:17:53,949 --> 00:17:55,659
I'll give you a hint.
It's your red skirt.

415
00:17:55,743 --> 00:17:57,661
I'll give you another hint.
We like it.

416
00:17:57,745 --> 00:17:59,955
He's just kidding.
Isn't that right,
John McClane?

417
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:01,165
Kidding? What?

418
00:18:01,248 --> 00:18:03,208
Are you saying that
my skirt is a joke?

419
00:18:03,292 --> 00:18:04,585
No, no, no, no.
We would never...

420
00:18:04,668 --> 00:18:06,628
We would never, uh,
mock your skirt.

421
00:18:06,712 --> 00:18:08,422
If anything, I think
you look good to go.

422
00:18:09,506 --> 00:18:10,506
"Good to go"?

423
00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:12,885
Good to go
out and about.

424
00:18:12,968 --> 00:18:14,428
Like I would take you now.

425
00:18:15,137 --> 00:18:16,346
- Take... Take me?
- Like...

426
00:18:17,181 --> 00:18:18,474
To a pizza parlor.

427
00:18:18,557 --> 00:18:19,767
I mean,
it's a good skirt.

428
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:21,769
Taut.

429
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:24,563
And, uh...

430
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,023
Business sexy.

431
00:18:26,398 --> 00:18:28,609
I mean, I think you look

432
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:32,196
like this is
work and play first,

433
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:34,990
and then
it could be sex, too.

434
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:36,116
Uh... Oh.

435
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,951
But consensual.

436
00:18:38,702 --> 00:18:40,954
Yeah, I don't have anything
to help you with that.

437
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:44,291
You look very good.

438
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:45,751
Are you having a stroke?

439
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:48,587
I'm gonna go back
to my office.

440
00:18:48,712 --> 00:18:51,423
Okay.
That's best.
Nice to meet you.

441
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:53,300
And I'll get you
those reports.

442
00:18:55,052 --> 00:18:56,094
I thought that went great.

443
00:18:57,596 --> 00:18:59,014
Ow!

444
00:18:59,097 --> 00:19:00,098
Jeez!

445
00:19:01,058 --> 00:19:02,643
What is business sexy?

446
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,771
Can we not
talk about it, please?

447
00:19:07,064 --> 00:19:08,649
That skirt is taut.

448
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:10,150
Jason!

449
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:12,861
You've been trying to ask
Elizabeth out for a year,

450
00:19:12,945 --> 00:19:14,655
but now you're all,
like, in your head.

451
00:19:14,738 --> 00:19:15,864
So when you try
and talk to her,

452
00:19:15,948 --> 00:19:16,990
you end up saying
something weird

453
00:19:17,074 --> 00:19:18,116
and kind of rapey.

454
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:20,702
You can't come visit
me at work like this
unannounced.

455
00:19:20,828 --> 00:19:22,830
That's not what you
said in your message.
What message?

456
00:19:22,913 --> 00:19:24,081
You sent it.

457
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:27,083
Telepathically.

458
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:28,669
You are not
telepathic, Jason.

459
00:19:28,752 --> 00:19:30,295
Yes, I am.
You're just closed off.

460
00:19:30,379 --> 00:19:32,673
What if my boss asks me
about the Nakatomi deal?

461
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:34,466
What am I
supposed to say?
Simple.

462
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:36,093
You tell him that
a group of German terrorists

463
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:37,803
seized the Nakatomi building

464
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:41,515
and now, Nakatomi is
looking to unload
the Plaza for a price.

465
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:42,641
You gotta
say it like that.

466
00:19:43,058 --> 00:19:45,394
"For a price."
Look at your own shoulder.

467
00:19:47,145 --> 00:19:48,355
What are you doing here?

468
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:50,357
Oh. Nardo's missing.

469
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,109
He's not answering his phone
and he's not in his room.

470
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:53,193
We gotta go find him.

471
00:19:53,277 --> 00:19:54,987
I can't leave right now.
Okay.

472
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:57,364
Then lend me your car,
I'll take my peach tea
and go get him myself.

473
00:19:57,447 --> 00:19:59,199
You know you can't
take my company car

474
00:19:59,283 --> 00:20:01,577
'cause I need to be
with you if you're
gonna be driving it.

475
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:04,454
Our best friend is missing
and you're worried
about your car?

476
00:20:05,873 --> 00:20:08,458
I got... I have something
to tell you, I just...

477
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:10,419
I'm moving out.

478
00:20:11,003 --> 00:20:12,004
What?

479
00:20:12,504 --> 00:20:13,922
You ruined Nardo's wedding,

480
00:20:14,006 --> 00:20:16,049
there's jelly beans
everywhere,

481
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:18,719
you're a fucking
hurricane, man.

482
00:20:18,802 --> 00:20:20,095
Well, you know what?

483
00:20:20,178 --> 00:20:22,180
There's a lot of negativity
coming from you right now.

484
00:20:22,264 --> 00:20:24,141
I think it's impeding
your general happiness,

485
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:26,560
so I really,
really encourage you
to just smoke some weed.

486
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:28,228
What?
And it'll be better.

487
00:20:28,312 --> 00:20:29,312
Get rid of it!

488
00:20:29,354 --> 00:20:31,607
Get rid of it?
Get rid of it!

489
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:34,276
What are you doing?
Don't smoke it...
Don't smoke it!

490
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:35,903
Don't smoke it!
Put it in your pocket!

491
00:20:35,986 --> 00:20:37,946
Put it one of
your nine pockets
on those shorts!

492
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,406
Damn it, Jason!

493
00:20:39,781 --> 00:20:41,116
Okay, jeez.

494
00:20:44,161 --> 00:20:45,162
Okay, all right.

495
00:20:45,704 --> 00:20:46,830
I gotta go back to work.

496
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:51,668
<i>I'd like to take his face.</i>

497
00:20:53,045 --> 00:20:54,129
Off.

498
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,590
Oh, Nicolas.

499
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:08,101
Hey, Jason?
Have you seen my Ambien?

500
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:11,355
Never mind, I found them.

501
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:14,191
Really?

502
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:27,329
Oh, he 'pooned him!

503
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,248
Hello?

504
00:21:30,332 --> 00:21:32,709
<i>Hello,</i>
<i>I have a collect call</i>
<i>from a Mr. Nardo.</i>

505
00:21:33,085 --> 00:21:34,127
Yeah, I'll accept
the charges.

506
00:21:34,211 --> 00:21:35,796
<i>Jason! I'm still
really pissed at you,</i>

507
00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:37,381
<i>but Evan is not
picking up his phone.</i>

508
00:21:37,965 --> 00:21:40,300
<i>I went down to the resort
to get Tracy back,</i>

509
00:21:40,384 --> 00:21:42,970
<i>and, uh,
I got carjacked, man!</i>

510
00:21:43,053 --> 00:21:44,304
You got carjacked?

511
00:21:44,388 --> 00:21:45,847
<i>They took my Fiat, Jason!</i>

512
00:21:45,931 --> 00:21:47,683
<i>And I'm lost,
and I'm scared</i>

513
00:21:47,766 --> 00:21:49,476
<i>and you gotta come down
and get me, man.</i>

514
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:50,686
Okay, where are you?

515
00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:52,062
<i>I don't know.
All I know is</i>

516
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:54,189
I am naked in
the middle of Mexico!

517
00:21:54,272 --> 00:21:55,691
<i>You're naked?
Are you sure?</i>

518
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,068
Yes, I'm fucking sure!

519
00:21:58,151 --> 00:21:59,945
You can see your
penis and everything?
<i>Yes!</i>

520
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:01,029
<i>Why are you naked?</i>

521
00:22:01,113 --> 00:22:02,114
I was wearing
my grandfather's tux,

522
00:22:02,197 --> 00:22:03,490
you know,
the Italian one?

523
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:04,783
They took that, too.

524
00:22:04,866 --> 00:22:07,411
So, you got carjacked,
and then you got tuxedojacked?

525
00:22:07,494 --> 00:22:08,829
<i>I am naked!</i>

526
00:22:08,912 --> 00:22:10,497
Okay? They're gonna get me!

527
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,124
We've all seen
the movie <i>Taken.</i>

528
00:22:12,207 --> 00:22:13,667
Okay, relax.
They're not gonna
<i>Taken</i> you.

529
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:14,960
That doesn't happen
down there.

530
00:22:15,043 --> 00:22:16,628
You know what they do
do sometimes?

531
00:22:16,712 --> 00:22:18,964
<i>They kill you and then
they hide drugs in your corpse</i>

532
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:20,632
and they ship your corpse
to your grandmother

533
00:22:20,716 --> 00:22:22,596
and then somebody
shows up and
kills your grandma

534
00:22:22,676 --> 00:22:23,927
and takes the drugs.

535
00:22:24,011 --> 00:22:25,178
<i>That actually happens a lot.</i>

536
00:22:25,262 --> 00:22:26,888
Is that...
Are you serious?

537
00:22:26,972 --> 00:22:28,974
Are you fucking serious?
Grammy!

538
00:22:29,099 --> 00:22:30,976
No way!
<i>No, no, no, no! Listen.</i>

539
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:33,103
Forget I said that.
Forget I said that.
<i>God!</i>

540
00:22:33,186 --> 00:22:35,605
I am going to
die here, Jason!

541
00:22:35,689 --> 00:22:37,774
I should be married
and on my honeymoon,

542
00:22:37,858 --> 00:22:39,651
but because of you
and your shit,

543
00:22:39,735 --> 00:22:42,571
I am going to
fucking get <i>Taken!</i>

544
00:22:42,654 --> 00:22:43,780
<i>Nardo. Nardo,
listen to me.</i>

545
00:22:43,864 --> 00:22:45,490
Everything is gonna be okay.
Say it.

546
00:22:45,574 --> 00:22:47,159
Everything is gonna be okay.

547
00:22:47,242 --> 00:22:48,910
No one is <i>Taken</i>-ing anyone.

548
00:22:48,994 --> 00:22:50,787
No one is <i>Taken</i>-ing anybody.

549
00:22:50,871 --> 00:22:51,872
Shit! What the fuck?

550
00:22:51,955 --> 00:22:53,248
What's that sound?
<i>What's that noise?</i>

551
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:55,375
Oh, my God!
Are there snakes here?
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

552
00:22:55,459 --> 00:22:58,045
There's rattlers,
there's serpents,

553
00:22:58,128 --> 00:23:00,088
there's <i>cobrinhas,</i>
which are tiny little cobras.

554
00:23:00,172 --> 00:23:01,381
<i>Fuck, no! Okay, no,</i>

555
00:23:01,465 --> 00:23:02,883
it's just a sign
that was blowing
in the wind.

556
00:23:02,966 --> 00:23:06,261
That was a bad example.
But shit is fucking
crazy out here, man.

557
00:23:06,344 --> 00:23:07,471
Look around.
What town are you in?

558
00:23:07,554 --> 00:23:08,597
<i>Town?</i>

559
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,766
Um... Shit, I don't know.
I don't know.

560
00:23:10,849 --> 00:23:12,309
Uh...

561
00:23:12,392 --> 00:23:13,894
Okay, there's a sign.

562
00:23:13,977 --> 00:23:17,272
It says... It says
"Mexico" on it. Mexico.

563
00:23:17,355 --> 00:23:19,483
You're in Mexico, Mexico?

564
00:23:19,649 --> 00:23:22,152
Mexico, Mexico?
Is that even a fucking place?

565
00:23:22,235 --> 00:23:23,278
<i>Does that exist?</i>

566
00:23:24,613 --> 00:23:25,655
Hold on.

567
00:23:25,989 --> 00:23:27,789
The sign has something
written on it. It says,

568
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:29,826
<i>"27, San Jacinto."</i>

569
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:31,578
Okay, 27, San Jacinto.

570
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:32,704
Stay where you are.

571
00:23:32,788 --> 00:23:34,039
<i>That can't be
that far from L.A.</i>

572
00:23:34,122 --> 00:23:35,916
Hurry, hurry, hurry!
Hurry the fuck up!

573
00:23:35,999 --> 00:23:37,375
<i>I'll see you in
two to three hours.</i>

574
00:23:46,843 --> 00:23:47,844
What?

575
00:23:49,971 --> 00:23:50,972
Tights!

576
00:23:59,856 --> 00:24:00,857
Hey, man!

577
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:03,401
Hey.

578
00:24:04,903 --> 00:24:05,987
Do you want
a piece of cake?

579
00:24:06,071 --> 00:24:08,365
I brought it.
It's in the backseat.
It's very good.

580
00:24:10,117 --> 00:24:11,868
What's happening?
Why am I in the car?

581
00:24:11,993 --> 00:24:14,412
Nardo's stranded.
We're going to Mexico.

582
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:17,332
I'm serious.
What?

583
00:24:17,415 --> 00:24:18,416
I tried to wake you.

584
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,100
I had to carry you.
Oh! Oh, no, no, no...

585
00:24:20,127 --> 00:24:22,087
I don't know what
sleeping pills
you're taking,

586
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:23,296
but they are heavy duty.

587
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,756
No, no. No, no, no...

588
00:24:25,215 --> 00:24:27,634
I can't... I can't...
I can't have this happen.

589
00:24:27,717 --> 00:24:29,511
I can't go to
Mexico right now.

590
00:24:29,594 --> 00:24:31,471
I'm sorry, but I can't
use the company car

591
00:24:31,555 --> 00:24:32,715
without you here
to supervise.

592
00:24:32,722 --> 00:24:34,599
That's your rule.
You made that very clear.

593
00:24:34,683 --> 00:24:35,723
So, you just kidnapped me?

594
00:24:36,226 --> 00:24:38,478
I had no choice.
Nardo's naked.

595
00:24:39,062 --> 00:24:40,105
He's naked?

596
00:24:40,188 --> 00:24:41,773
Yeah. Nude.

597
00:24:42,566 --> 00:24:43,733
In Mexico?

598
00:24:44,568 --> 00:24:46,444
What time is it?
Midnight.

599
00:24:46,528 --> 00:24:47,904
Oh, fuck, Jason!

600
00:24:47,988 --> 00:24:49,322
All right, before you
get really worked up,

601
00:24:49,406 --> 00:24:50,532
I've already
thought this through.

602
00:24:50,615 --> 00:24:51,658
Look at the GPS.

603
00:24:51,741 --> 00:24:53,341
We're here, heading
south of Los Angeles.

604
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:57,414
Now, Nardo is here,
14 miles south of
the Mexican border. Okay?

605
00:24:57,539 --> 00:25:00,542
Two and half hours down,
that puts Nardo in
the car at 2:30 a.m.

606
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:02,335
Then three hours
back up to Los Angeles,

607
00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:04,212
that puts us in L.A.
at 5:30 a.m.

608
00:25:04,296 --> 00:25:06,173
Your meeting's
at 8:00, right?
Yeah.

609
00:25:06,256 --> 00:25:08,884
Okay? Then we have
two and a half hours
of flex time.

610
00:25:08,967 --> 00:25:10,844
You could have at least
brought me something to wear.

611
00:25:10,927 --> 00:25:11,928
I did.

612
00:25:12,012 --> 00:25:14,372
I brought your
dry cleaning, your wallet
and your toothbrush.

613
00:25:14,431 --> 00:25:17,017
You're all set
for your meeting.
Off you go.

614
00:25:18,602 --> 00:25:19,936
This is not
my dry cleaning.

615
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:22,189
They gave me this by mistake,
I was supposed to
bring it back today.

616
00:25:22,272 --> 00:25:23,523
What is it?

617
00:25:23,607 --> 00:25:25,192
It's a woman's pant suit.

618
00:25:25,609 --> 00:25:29,112
Well, sometimes life wants
you to put on a pant suit
and drive to Mexico.

619
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,489
If I do this,
I am doing it for Nardo.

620
00:25:31,615 --> 00:25:33,825
We are driving to Mexico
and then we are
driving right back.

621
00:25:33,909 --> 00:25:34,909
No extra stops.

622
00:25:34,951 --> 00:25:36,745
No other stops?
No other stops.

623
00:25:36,828 --> 00:25:38,079
None after this one.

624
00:25:38,205 --> 00:25:39,956
Whoa,
whoa, whoa! Wait!

625
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,458
Oh, where are we going?

626
00:25:41,666 --> 00:25:43,251
Remember when
I lost my wallet?

627
00:25:43,335 --> 00:25:45,629
I remember when you
jumped in a pool with it
in your back pocket.

628
00:25:45,712 --> 00:25:47,047
And I remember when
you left it out
in the sun to dry.

629
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:49,216
I remember
all those things.

630
00:25:49,758 --> 00:25:51,134
You go do whatever
you have to do.

631
00:25:51,218 --> 00:25:52,594
I'm just gonna
stay in the car.

632
00:25:52,677 --> 00:25:53,929
No, no, no, no.

633
00:25:54,012 --> 00:25:56,264
This guy's kind of hardcore.
I need your help.

634
00:25:57,682 --> 00:26:00,477
I don't know how much
help I'm gonna be.
Look at me.

635
00:26:01,144 --> 00:26:02,312
You look great.

636
00:26:03,521 --> 00:26:04,856
I look like a Golden Girl.

637
00:26:05,982 --> 00:26:07,567
The best Golden Girl!

638
00:26:07,651 --> 00:26:09,778
I don't know, I feel
like I have a camel toe.

639
00:26:09,861 --> 00:26:11,321
Remind me why
we're here again?

640
00:26:11,404 --> 00:26:13,073
Well, remember
when I lost my wallet?

641
00:26:13,156 --> 00:26:14,824
Well, you can't leave
the country without an ID,

642
00:26:14,908 --> 00:26:16,493
so this guy's
gonna make me one.

643
00:26:16,576 --> 00:26:18,787
Shh! Shut up.
People are trying to sleep.

644
00:26:19,496 --> 00:26:20,580
He's 11.

645
00:26:20,664 --> 00:26:21,915
Here. It's all there.

646
00:26:21,998 --> 00:26:23,250
Good.

647
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:25,710
Now get your ass inside
before you wake up my moms.

648
00:26:29,381 --> 00:26:30,715
Ahh!

649
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,092
Jesus!

650
00:26:32,175 --> 00:26:33,927
That flash is really bright.

651
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:35,053
Don't smile so much.

652
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,680
It's a license,
not the fucking prom.

653
00:26:36,763 --> 00:26:38,682
Good one, Kenny.
Excellent.

654
00:26:40,517 --> 00:26:41,518
Ahh!

655
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:45,021
Shit! Keep it down!

656
00:26:45,105 --> 00:26:46,356
That was loud, huh?

657
00:26:46,856 --> 00:26:47,941
Kenny, sweetie?

658
00:26:48,024 --> 00:26:49,067
Shit! It's my fucking mom!

659
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,568
Hide, hide, hide!

660
00:26:51,194 --> 00:26:52,195
Kenny?

661
00:26:58,827 --> 00:27:00,161
Kenny, honey, you okay?

662
00:27:00,537 --> 00:27:02,372
Sorry, Mom.
I had a bad dream.

663
00:27:02,455 --> 00:27:05,125
I was just in here,
reading <i>Chicken Soup</i>
<i>for the Teenage Soul.</i>

664
00:27:05,208 --> 00:27:06,334
Aw...

665
00:27:06,418 --> 00:27:08,211
Sweetie pie, come here.

666
00:27:08,295 --> 00:27:10,463
Hop on the mommy train.

667
00:27:10,547 --> 00:27:11,965
Oh, there you go.

668
00:27:12,048 --> 00:27:13,300
Who's my guy?

669
00:27:13,383 --> 00:27:14,884
I am.

670
00:27:14,968 --> 00:27:16,136
Who's my guy?

671
00:27:16,219 --> 00:27:17,387
I am.

672
00:27:20,181 --> 00:27:21,558
She can't see us.

673
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:26,632
Wait, wait, wait!
Don't freak out!

674
00:27:26,646 --> 00:27:28,486
Who the fuck are you?
We're friends of Kenny's.

675
00:27:28,523 --> 00:27:29,733
Yeah, he's making me
a fake ID.

676
00:27:29,858 --> 00:27:31,151
What are they talking about?

677
00:27:31,234 --> 00:27:32,444
I don't know.

678
00:27:32,527 --> 00:27:33,778
What do you
mean, you don't know?
You know!

679
00:27:33,862 --> 00:27:36,531
Look at
the camera and everything!
I'm Fletcher Simmons!

680
00:27:36,614 --> 00:27:38,867
Yeah! He's like a weird
little businessman!

681
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:40,577
Wait, is this true?

682
00:27:41,578 --> 00:27:42,620
The truth is,

683
00:27:43,163 --> 00:27:44,372
they gave me this money

684
00:27:44,456 --> 00:27:46,624
to take pictures
of my balls.
What?

685
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:48,001
- That's bullshit, Kenny!
- Oh, my God!

686
00:27:48,084 --> 00:27:49,419
That is way out of line!
No, I would not take...

687
00:27:49,502 --> 00:27:51,338
Why would we want pictures
of a boy's balls?

688
00:27:51,421 --> 00:27:54,007
If anything, we would
need pictures of
the whole shaft and...

689
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:55,717
What?
You stay away from him!

690
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,880
No, no. Kenny and I are cool.
Come, here, little boy.

691
00:27:59,262 --> 00:28:00,847
You stay away from him!

692
00:28:04,434 --> 00:28:05,643
We've got perverts!

693
00:28:08,605 --> 00:28:10,285
That's a dick move, Kenny,
and you know it!

694
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:15,153
Oh!

695
00:28:16,112 --> 00:28:17,113
Ow!

696
00:28:20,658 --> 00:28:21,951
Perverts!

697
00:28:24,662 --> 00:28:26,456
Help! Help!

698
00:28:26,706 --> 00:28:28,208
Evan!

699
00:28:29,376 --> 00:28:30,752
Honey, I got him!

700
00:28:30,835 --> 00:28:32,170
Who are you?

701
00:28:32,253 --> 00:28:34,631
I'm Kenny's
other mom, fucker.

702
00:28:38,802 --> 00:28:39,803
Jason!

703
00:28:39,969 --> 00:28:41,679
What a terrible family!

704
00:28:41,805 --> 00:28:43,598
Keys, keys, keys, keys!

705
00:28:43,681 --> 00:28:44,682
Okay, hold on.

706
00:29:04,244 --> 00:29:06,079
Come on, Jason,
pick up the phone.

707
00:29:06,704 --> 00:29:08,373
It's him!
Pull over, pull over!

708
00:29:08,456 --> 00:29:09,456
- Hello?
<i>- Jason!</i>

709
00:29:09,499 --> 00:29:10,625
Nardo!
<i>Evan! Yes!</i>

710
00:29:10,708 --> 00:29:12,043
Oh, my God, yes!

711
00:29:13,211 --> 00:29:15,211
Hey, Nardo.
How's it going, man?
Where are you guys?

712
00:29:15,255 --> 00:29:16,256
Uh,
we're about halfway,

713
00:29:16,339 --> 00:29:18,099
but we are on our way.
We know your location.

714
00:29:18,133 --> 00:29:20,760
Wait, no, no, no!
I'm not there anymore, okay?

715
00:29:20,844 --> 00:29:22,762
Yeah, I ran into a town

716
00:29:22,846 --> 00:29:24,597
and now my tights are ripped.

717
00:29:24,681 --> 00:29:26,266
Your tights?
<i>Yeah, I actually dig them,</i>

718
00:29:26,349 --> 00:29:28,101
and I'm kind of bummed
that they're ruined.

719
00:29:28,184 --> 00:29:29,561
Where are you now?
What are you looking at?

720
00:29:29,644 --> 00:29:30,854
What do you see
around you?

721
00:29:30,937 --> 00:29:33,565
Uh... I don't know,
it's hard to say.
Everywhere I go,

722
00:29:33,648 --> 00:29:35,692
everything's in fucking
Mexican words.

723
00:29:35,775 --> 00:29:36,776
<i>You mean Spanish?</i>

724
00:29:36,985 --> 00:29:38,486
<i>I mean Mexican.</i>

725
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,282
It's Mexico, man.
I'm not in Spain.

726
00:29:42,449 --> 00:29:43,658
<i>Fucking idiot!</i>

727
00:29:43,741 --> 00:29:45,618
Look around you.
What do you see?

728
00:29:45,702 --> 00:29:48,079
Uh... Okay, there's
something that says...

729
00:29:48,621 --> 00:29:49,622
Fucking what?

730
00:29:53,042 --> 00:29:55,170
Oh, "Get casheer."
"Get cassair"?

731
00:29:55,253 --> 00:29:56,337
"Get casher"?

732
00:29:56,421 --> 00:29:57,422
"Get cashhere."

733
00:29:57,881 --> 00:29:59,883
"Get cash here," Nardo?

734
00:30:03,511 --> 00:30:05,180
Sorry. It does say,
"Get cash here."

735
00:30:05,263 --> 00:30:08,057
Actually, below, it says,
"U.S. Wire Service," but...

736
00:30:08,141 --> 00:30:09,225
Okay, new plan.

737
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:10,810
<i>We're gonna wire you $500.</i>

738
00:30:10,894 --> 00:30:13,605
<i>That way,</i>
<i>you can go to the resort</i>
<i>and I can go back to L.A.</i>

739
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:15,398
Do you have
your ID on you?
<i>No, Evan,</i>

740
00:30:15,482 --> 00:30:17,192
I don't have an ID.
I have tights.

741
00:30:17,275 --> 00:30:19,068
You're going to
find someone with an ID

742
00:30:19,152 --> 00:30:21,154
and then I will wire them
$50 extra to say

743
00:30:21,237 --> 00:30:22,697
<i>thank you for the favor.</i>
Yes, thank you.

744
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:25,325
Thank you so much!
Okay, just hold on.

745
00:30:26,075 --> 00:30:27,494
<i>Hola. Hola.</i>

746
00:30:27,577 --> 00:30:28,578
<i>Aloha.</i>

747
00:30:28,661 --> 00:30:29,662
What?

748
00:30:29,746 --> 00:30:33,500
I have a friend who's trying
to send me money in there

749
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:36,294
and I just need
someone with an ID card

750
00:30:36,377 --> 00:30:37,921
to go in there
and sign for it.

751
00:30:38,004 --> 00:30:39,506
I'll give you 50 bucks.

752
00:30:39,589 --> 00:30:42,008
60.
$60!

753
00:30:42,091 --> 00:30:44,385
Well, it's hardly
a time to bargain. Yes.

754
00:30:44,469 --> 00:30:45,970
- Yes, $60.
<i>- Okay.</i>

755
00:30:46,054 --> 00:30:47,096
Okay, great.

756
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:49,641
You're saving my hide,
honestly.

757
00:30:49,724 --> 00:30:51,518
Thank you so much!
Mmm-hmm.

758
00:30:51,601 --> 00:30:54,938
Okay, send the money
to Sarah McLachlan.

759
00:30:58,358 --> 00:30:59,484
Like the Sarah McLachlan?

760
00:30:59,567 --> 00:31:00,610
Love Sarah McLachlan!

761
00:31:01,277 --> 00:31:03,780
She's a very famous singer.
You sure you're
Sarah McLachlan?

762
00:31:03,863 --> 00:31:04,989
Yeah. Why?

763
00:31:05,073 --> 00:31:07,033
Ask her if she's
the Sarah McLachlan.

764
00:31:08,493 --> 00:31:10,662
It's the Mexican version.

765
00:31:10,745 --> 00:31:13,414
Nardo, I am going to wire
you and Sarah McLachlan
money.

766
00:31:13,498 --> 00:31:14,582
Just hang tight,
okay, pal?

767
00:31:14,666 --> 00:31:16,042
Evan, thank you!

768
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:18,628
Okay, so where do we wire
money from at this hour?

769
00:31:18,711 --> 00:31:20,046
You know,
Marty works near here.

770
00:31:20,129 --> 00:31:21,569
I bet we could
wire money from there.

771
00:31:26,511 --> 00:31:28,638
Look, they spelled
"sluts" wrong, right?

772
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:30,723
If the "O" was a "U."
It's a minor change.

773
00:31:30,807 --> 00:31:32,058
Hey, can you handle
this wire transfer?

774
00:31:32,141 --> 00:31:33,142
I gotta make
a work call real quick.

775
00:31:33,226 --> 00:31:34,310
Are you gonna
ask out Elizabeth?

776
00:31:34,394 --> 00:31:36,020
I am not messing around
with anyone from work.

777
00:31:36,104 --> 00:31:38,398
Oh, don't pretend like
it's an ethical thing, okay?

778
00:31:38,481 --> 00:31:39,607
You're scared
because you like her

779
00:31:39,691 --> 00:31:40,775
and you can't even
talk to her.

780
00:31:40,858 --> 00:31:41,859
Hey!

781
00:31:48,157 --> 00:31:49,409
Hello?
Hey, it's me.

782
00:31:49,492 --> 00:31:51,327
I mean, it's Evan.
It's not "me," it's Evan.

783
00:31:51,703 --> 00:31:52,787
Oh, hey.

784
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:54,622
I'm sorry to
catch you so late.

785
00:31:54,706 --> 00:31:56,332
That's okay.
What's going on?

786
00:31:56,916 --> 00:32:00,128
Uh, well, I wanted to
touch base with you
about the steam tomorrow.

787
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:02,714
You're calling me now
to touch base?

788
00:32:02,797 --> 00:32:05,258
<i>Look, there's an outside shot
that I might be a little late.</i>

789
00:32:05,341 --> 00:32:07,468
I'm taking my mom
to the dentist.

790
00:32:07,552 --> 00:32:08,970
Where are you?

791
00:32:09,637 --> 00:32:11,764
I'm in L.A.
Tell her.

792
00:32:11,848 --> 00:32:12,974
Uh... The Sizzler.

793
00:32:13,057 --> 00:32:14,309
I love the Sizzler.

794
00:32:14,392 --> 00:32:15,476
<i>You know what?
Don't worry about it.</i>

795
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,603
<i>Order up!</i>

796
00:32:16,686 --> 00:32:19,230
Don't be an asshole.
Just tell me what's going on.

797
00:32:19,314 --> 00:32:20,481
Sizzling steaks!

798
00:32:20,565 --> 00:32:21,685
You know what?
I have to run.

799
00:32:21,774 --> 00:32:23,109
Look at this menu!
I'm sorry about this,
Elizabeth.

800
00:32:23,192 --> 00:32:24,193
I will talk to you tomorrow.
Goodbye.

801
00:32:24,277 --> 00:32:25,528
I want a twice-loaded
baked potato.

802
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:27,488
Great. Now Elizabeth
hates me.
What? I helped. Marty!

803
00:32:27,572 --> 00:32:29,032
But you could also...
Oh, my God!

804
00:32:29,115 --> 00:32:31,117
Put this in my office
and do not take a bite.

805
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,400
Are you kidding me?
What is up?

806
00:32:33,202 --> 00:32:34,871
Yeah! All right!

807
00:32:34,954 --> 00:32:36,247
My favorite customer!

808
00:32:36,331 --> 00:32:37,611
That means a lot
coming from you.

809
00:32:37,665 --> 00:32:39,876
'Cause it means you lose.

810
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:41,127
We're actually not here
to gamble, Marty.

811
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:42,295
Oh, okay. Right.

812
00:32:42,378 --> 00:32:43,755
I get what you're saying.

813
00:32:43,838 --> 00:32:46,007
You wanna party
in Marty's van.

814
00:32:46,132 --> 00:32:48,092
No, no.
Yeah, I'll do that.
Let's do that.

815
00:32:48,176 --> 00:32:49,176
Check this out.

816
00:32:49,218 --> 00:32:51,095
Maybe they're sisters,
maybe they're friends.

817
00:32:51,721 --> 00:32:53,222
I hope they're lesbians.

818
00:32:54,098 --> 00:32:55,698
Come on,
I wanna show you this.
Come here.

819
00:32:55,725 --> 00:32:57,605
You know, I've actually
been in your van, Marty.

820
00:32:57,644 --> 00:32:59,228
Yeah, you wish!

821
00:32:59,312 --> 00:33:00,396
Who the fuck
is this guy?

822
00:33:00,605 --> 00:33:02,940
Only cool guys are
allowed in Marty's van.

823
00:33:03,024 --> 00:33:04,734
Can we just please
make a wire transfer?

824
00:33:06,778 --> 00:33:08,488
All right.
Let's go on back.
Thank you.

825
00:33:08,571 --> 00:33:11,324
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, no, no. Turquoise Tommy
stays out here.

826
00:33:11,407 --> 00:33:14,077
You're good, okay? No.

827
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,203
Get him out of here.
Thank you.

828
00:33:15,244 --> 00:33:17,163
Marty.
We know each other, Marty.
Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

829
00:33:17,246 --> 00:33:19,082
Look, Marty has
great instincts, okay?

830
00:33:19,165 --> 00:33:22,168
Now, let me take care
of the wire transfer
and you go chill at the bar.

831
00:33:22,251 --> 00:33:24,796
Look,
there's an attractive girl.
Go over there and hit on her.

832
00:33:24,879 --> 00:33:26,506
I am not hitting
on a random girl

833
00:33:26,589 --> 00:33:29,842
at a random casino
in the middle of the night.

834
00:33:29,926 --> 00:33:33,179
Evan,
earlier you told Elizabeth
she looked good to go.

835
00:33:33,262 --> 00:33:34,305
Do you remember that?
Yeah.

836
00:33:34,389 --> 00:33:35,390
As I was standing there,
cringing. Right?

837
00:33:35,473 --> 00:33:36,474
I know it was bad.

838
00:33:36,557 --> 00:33:37,850
It was really, really bad.
I know. I know.

839
00:33:37,934 --> 00:33:39,227
So your skills
have fallen off.

840
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:40,550
Now, go over there
and practice.

841
00:33:40,603 --> 00:33:41,854
She's gonna reject you,

842
00:33:41,938 --> 00:33:44,219
but you'll learn something,
all right?
There's no downside.

843
00:33:44,273 --> 00:33:46,401
I could think of, like,
100 downsides, Jason.

844
00:33:46,484 --> 00:33:47,568
Just go over there.

845
00:33:47,652 --> 00:33:49,987
I'll borrow some clothes
from Marty for you, okay?

846
00:33:50,113 --> 00:33:51,823
And then you go
hit on her, come on!

847
00:33:51,906 --> 00:33:53,908
We're in a casino.
Let's have fun.

848
00:33:59,789 --> 00:34:00,790
Yes!

849
00:34:00,873 --> 00:34:03,710
I am Hugo!

850
00:34:05,503 --> 00:34:06,713
I'm Hugo.

851
00:34:11,134 --> 00:34:12,301
Hey.

852
00:34:12,385 --> 00:34:13,469
Is it cool
if I sit here?

853
00:34:13,553 --> 00:34:14,887
Are you sure
you wanna do that?

854
00:34:14,971 --> 00:34:16,222
Yeah, why wouldn't I?

855
00:34:16,305 --> 00:34:18,141
Well, I mean,
you've heard the stories.

856
00:34:18,224 --> 00:34:22,228
Nice guy has drinks
with a strange girl
in a casino,

857
00:34:22,311 --> 00:34:24,731
she gets him
up to her room,

858
00:34:24,814 --> 00:34:26,524
one thing
leads to another,

859
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:31,237
he wakes up three days later
missing a kidney.

860
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,530
Yeah, well,
I don't have that much time,

861
00:34:32,613 --> 00:34:33,853
so I think I'll
take my chances.

862
00:34:34,031 --> 00:34:35,992
That's a spooky shirt.

863
00:34:36,117 --> 00:34:37,493
Are you a magician?

864
00:34:37,618 --> 00:34:40,413
You know what?
I borrowed this, actually.

865
00:34:40,496 --> 00:34:43,332
But careful,
I will cast a spell on you.

866
00:34:43,416 --> 00:34:46,294
You'll have sex with me
and you won't even know it.

867
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:48,910
Not against your will.
That's...

868
00:34:49,505 --> 00:34:50,506
That's rape.

869
00:34:53,968 --> 00:34:56,012
I love it.
You're hilarious.

870
00:34:56,971 --> 00:35:00,224
Two vodka gimlets,
compliments of
the Amazing Hugo.

871
00:35:02,602 --> 00:35:04,270
You know
the Amazing Hugo?

872
00:35:04,353 --> 00:35:06,189
Yeah, well, I come here
a lot on business.

873
00:35:06,272 --> 00:35:07,857
Oh.

874
00:35:09,066 --> 00:35:10,151
Mmm!

875
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:15,031
You're cute.

876
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:17,492
Thank you.

877
00:35:21,662 --> 00:35:22,663
Mmm!

878
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,428
Hi.
Hello.

879
00:35:38,638 --> 00:35:40,640
What... What happened?

880
00:35:40,723 --> 00:35:43,142
Well, you passed out.

881
00:35:43,643 --> 00:35:44,894
Are we...

882
00:35:45,686 --> 00:35:47,647
Are we having sex?

883
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:49,690
No, I'm sorry.
We're not.

884
00:35:49,774 --> 00:35:51,317
I'm prepping you.

885
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,528
Prepping me?
Ooh. Hmm.

886
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:56,072
I need to be prepped.

887
00:35:57,698 --> 00:35:59,033
Wait a minute.

888
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:00,493
Are you taking my kidney?

889
00:36:00,576 --> 00:36:03,663
Yes, I am.
I'm afraid so.

890
00:36:05,122 --> 00:36:06,123
Why are your clothes off?

891
00:36:06,207 --> 00:36:08,459
Because I didn't
want to get blood on them.

892
00:36:10,253 --> 00:36:11,254
Why can't I move my arms?

893
00:36:11,754 --> 00:36:13,214
Why can't I move my arms?

894
00:36:13,297 --> 00:36:14,632
Oh, because
you're paralyzed. See?

895
00:36:17,802 --> 00:36:18,803
My God!

896
00:36:18,928 --> 00:36:20,808
You're really not even
supposed to be conscious.

897
00:36:20,888 --> 00:36:22,139
What?
Hugo?

898
00:36:22,765 --> 00:36:24,183
Why the fuck
is he awake?

899
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,185
Boom!

900
00:36:26,269 --> 00:36:28,062
The Amazing Hugo?
Yeah, you a fan?

901
00:36:28,563 --> 00:36:30,189
Not really a fan.

902
00:36:30,273 --> 00:36:31,273
Ha-ha. Whatever.

903
00:36:31,357 --> 00:36:33,067
What's up with
the anesthesia?
I'm not using it.

904
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,360
I'm using tranquilizers
on this one.

905
00:36:34,443 --> 00:36:36,279
Oh, you're using
tranquilizers? Why?

906
00:36:36,362 --> 00:36:37,864
Because amethocaine
is expensive.

907
00:36:37,947 --> 00:36:39,782
I wonder why.
Probably because it works.

908
00:36:39,907 --> 00:36:41,617
Hey, he's numb, isn't he?

909
00:36:41,701 --> 00:36:44,203
Don't you... Don't you usually
take kidneys from the back?

910
00:36:44,287 --> 00:36:46,831
Oh, yeah,
that's how doctors do it.
We go in the front, though.

911
00:36:46,914 --> 00:36:49,000
Just scoop everything out
until we find the kidney,

912
00:36:49,083 --> 00:36:50,209
just rip that out,

913
00:36:50,293 --> 00:36:52,962
throw it in a cooler
and we are outta here
while you bleed out.

914
00:36:53,462 --> 00:36:56,382
This is like a giant,
human-sized game
of <i>Operation</i> for us.

915
00:36:56,465 --> 00:36:57,800
Be careful,
don't touch the sides!

916
00:36:57,925 --> 00:36:59,010
Stop it!
Stop messing with him!

917
00:36:59,093 --> 00:37:00,094
What? So?

918
00:37:00,177 --> 00:37:01,387
This is not
good for business.

919
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:03,472
We don't want
a stressed kidney.

920
00:37:03,556 --> 00:37:04,724
Oh, you think
he's freaked out now?

921
00:37:04,807 --> 00:37:07,226
Wait till we cut him open
and his guts spill out
onto the bed,

922
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:09,353
like a fucking piñata
full of garbage.

923
00:37:09,437 --> 00:37:11,063
He's probably gonna
be screaming, too.

924
00:37:11,147 --> 00:37:12,231
Ah! And crying.

925
00:37:12,315 --> 00:37:14,317
You're being a real
fucking bitch about this, man.

926
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,568
Can you imagine
looking down

927
00:37:15,651 --> 00:37:17,320
and just seeing the insides
of your own body?

928
00:37:17,403 --> 00:37:18,905
I mean, right? Just like...

929
00:37:18,988 --> 00:37:20,031
Everything spilling out.

930
00:37:20,114 --> 00:37:21,908
Guts and viscera.
What's viscera?

931
00:37:21,991 --> 00:37:24,351
Viscera is all
the inside stuff that
doesn't even have names.

932
00:37:24,744 --> 00:37:25,828
You're gonna die.

933
00:37:25,912 --> 00:37:27,747
Stop it. Would you
stop messing with him?

934
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:28,915
What?
You fucking idiot.

935
00:37:28,998 --> 00:37:29,999
Please, please

936
00:37:30,082 --> 00:37:31,167
I love it
when they beg.

937
00:37:31,834 --> 00:37:33,419
Like a tiny baby.
Don't, don't, don't.

938
00:37:33,502 --> 00:37:34,503
Don't do this,
please, please.

939
00:37:34,587 --> 00:37:35,588
I can give you money.
Oh, look at him.

940
00:37:35,713 --> 00:37:37,965
He has so much
raw fear in his eyes.
Yeah.

941
00:37:38,049 --> 00:37:39,759
It's kind of
creeping me out.

942
00:37:39,842 --> 00:37:41,385
Fuck! You can't do this!

943
00:37:41,469 --> 00:37:43,054
You can't do this!
What is that?

944
00:37:43,596 --> 00:37:45,556
No, no, no!
Problem solved.
Look at that.

945
00:37:46,432 --> 00:37:48,935
Hey, buddy? Hey, guy?

946
00:37:49,268 --> 00:37:50,478
Hey, little fella.

947
00:37:50,561 --> 00:37:53,564
Oh, is it a sad day for you?

948
00:37:53,648 --> 00:37:55,608
Look in my eyes.
Look in my eyes.
I don't want to.

949
00:37:55,691 --> 00:37:57,485
Hey, sad eyes, look at me.
Look at me!
I don't want to!

950
00:37:57,568 --> 00:37:58,903
Look at me!

951
00:37:58,986 --> 00:38:00,279
I'm the last face
you're ever gonna see.

952
00:38:00,363 --> 00:38:01,614
Oh, my God!

953
00:38:01,739 --> 00:38:03,616
Okay, buddy.
You hang out here.

954
00:38:03,699 --> 00:38:05,826
We'll be back in
a couple minutes.
We gotta keep prepping.

955
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:06,953
Stay right there.

956
00:38:07,036 --> 00:38:09,038
You're adorable.
No.

957
00:38:11,332 --> 00:38:12,375
Okay.

958
00:38:13,542 --> 00:38:15,795
You say you're
telepathic, Jason?

959
00:38:15,878 --> 00:38:17,588
Now's your chance
to prove it.

960
00:38:17,672 --> 00:38:19,131
Evan's in trouble.

961
00:38:19,215 --> 00:38:20,383
Find Evan.

962
00:38:20,925 --> 00:38:22,051
Find Evan.

963
00:38:22,134 --> 00:38:23,886
Find Evan!

964
00:38:27,223 --> 00:38:29,266
You shut your mouth
or I'll cut your wiener off

965
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:30,935
and shove that
in there, okay?

966
00:38:31,018 --> 00:38:32,228
You weirdo.

967
00:38:37,233 --> 00:38:38,526
I love you.

968
00:38:41,237 --> 00:38:44,031
Hey, Evan. Something's
wrong with the card.
The wire didn't go through.

969
00:38:44,115 --> 00:38:45,658
Look, if you're
hooking up with that girl,

970
00:38:45,741 --> 00:38:47,284
I think it's both
awesome and bullshit

971
00:38:47,368 --> 00:38:49,787
'cause Nardo's in trouble,
but that girl was hot.

972
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,330
Oh, wait,
I gotta call you back.

973
00:38:51,414 --> 00:38:52,581
Hey, Pocahontas.

974
00:38:53,416 --> 00:38:54,542
Oh, shit.

975
00:38:55,543 --> 00:38:57,211
What? Well,
it's nice to see you, too.

976
00:38:57,294 --> 00:38:59,255
No, I'm sorry, it's just that
you're the entire reason

977
00:38:59,338 --> 00:39:00,423
I stopped doing shots
with customers.

978
00:39:00,506 --> 00:39:01,507
Please don't
put that on my tray.

979
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:03,342
No, you know what?
Leave it,
it's already balanced.

980
00:39:03,426 --> 00:39:04,677
You're gonna spill.

981
00:39:05,261 --> 00:39:06,429
Leave me alone.

982
00:39:06,804 --> 00:39:07,805
Don't say that.

983
00:39:07,888 --> 00:39:09,890
Hey, we were two
star-crossed lovers

984
00:39:09,974 --> 00:39:11,350
from different worlds

985
00:39:11,434 --> 00:39:12,768
breaking through generations

986
00:39:12,852 --> 00:39:14,311
of tribal conflict
with our embrace.

987
00:39:14,395 --> 00:39:15,646
So sorry for the gorilla.

988
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:16,856
Can you go away?

989
00:39:17,898 --> 00:39:18,899
Hi, I'm Jason.

990
00:39:20,192 --> 00:39:22,278
I really do need your help,
though. Honestly.

991
00:39:24,613 --> 00:39:25,656
What?

992
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:27,199
My friend's missing, okay?

993
00:39:27,283 --> 00:39:30,661
He was in track pants
and an un-ironically
bad T-shirt.

994
00:39:30,745 --> 00:39:32,121
Did you see him?

995
00:39:32,204 --> 00:39:33,748
Of course that
was your friend.

996
00:39:33,831 --> 00:39:35,374
He was a mess.

997
00:39:35,458 --> 00:39:37,334
Wait, what do you mean?
He was trashed.

998
00:39:37,418 --> 00:39:38,502
His girlfriend
was carrying him.

999
00:39:38,586 --> 00:39:39,586
What?

1000
00:39:39,628 --> 00:39:40,629
Carrying him?
Mmm-hmm.

1001
00:39:40,755 --> 00:39:42,840
Couldn't get
onto the elevator.
Hugo had to help.

1002
00:39:42,965 --> 00:39:44,717
That doesn't
make any sense.

1003
00:39:45,176 --> 00:39:46,761
Hey, thanks again for this.

1004
00:39:46,844 --> 00:39:48,095
Well, this better
not be another ploy

1005
00:39:48,179 --> 00:39:49,346
to get me back
into the wave pool.

1006
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:50,431
No, of course not.

1007
00:39:50,514 --> 00:39:53,142
That being said,
if something was to
arise organically,

1008
00:39:53,225 --> 00:39:55,144
I'm not gonna fight it.
It's not going to.

1009
00:39:55,978 --> 00:39:57,813
Hugo. Open up.

1010
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:02,193
What?

1011
00:40:02,276 --> 00:40:03,916
Where's that guy that
you brought up here?

1012
00:40:04,612 --> 00:40:06,692
I don't know what you mean.
What guy?
There was a guy.

1013
00:40:06,697 --> 00:40:09,408
He was wasted
and you loaded him
into the elevator.

1014
00:40:10,659 --> 00:40:13,162
Did you hear that?
It sounded like
a tiny, tiny scream.

1015
00:40:13,913 --> 00:40:15,206
What are you up to?

1016
00:40:15,289 --> 00:40:16,499
Nothing.
I've got a new puppy in here.

1017
00:40:16,665 --> 00:40:19,960
I got a tiny
little puppy that I'm...
That I'm training.

1018
00:40:20,044 --> 00:40:22,213
Can you just let us in
or show us the puppy?

1019
00:40:22,296 --> 00:40:23,964
Either way,
we'll know you're not lying.

1020
00:40:24,048 --> 00:40:26,008
Where's the guy?
This conversation is over!

1021
00:40:26,092 --> 00:40:29,220
In fact,
I'm gonna hang up this door
like a phone in your face!

1022
00:40:35,392 --> 00:40:36,435
Do you hear that?

1023
00:40:37,186 --> 00:40:38,187
There it was again.

1024
00:40:39,688 --> 00:40:40,856
A tiny, tiny scream.

1025
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,274
Like a little woman scream.

1026
00:40:42,399 --> 00:40:43,818
Shut up!
Just shut your mouth!

1027
00:40:43,901 --> 00:40:45,694
What do we do now?
I have an idea.

1028
00:40:46,612 --> 00:40:47,613
Come on.

1029
00:40:50,157 --> 00:40:52,243
Okay, well, let's go
downstairs and not
come back up at all.

1030
00:40:52,326 --> 00:40:53,327
Shh!

1031
00:40:56,455 --> 00:40:58,707
Shut your fat face,
you dumb dildo.

1032
00:41:11,095 --> 00:41:12,555
Now what do we do?

1033
00:41:12,847 --> 00:41:14,306
Now we dance.

1034
00:41:16,225 --> 00:41:17,351
What?

1035
00:41:20,354 --> 00:41:21,981
- No, no, wait.
- You're not...

1036
00:41:22,064 --> 00:41:23,649
You're...
You're not gonna...

1037
00:41:24,859 --> 00:41:25,901
Oh, shit!

1038
00:41:26,026 --> 00:41:27,027
That was good.

1039
00:41:28,445 --> 00:41:29,613
Beautiful flourish.

1040
00:41:31,991 --> 00:41:33,242
Oh, shit.

1041
00:41:36,912 --> 00:41:38,038
Which, uh...

1042
00:41:38,372 --> 00:41:40,166
Which... On your left leg,
you went first?

1043
00:41:40,249 --> 00:41:41,625
It doesn't matter.

1044
00:41:41,709 --> 00:41:43,460
Oh, no!

1045
00:41:45,588 --> 00:41:47,548
Sorry. You okay?

1046
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:49,758
Get off.

1047
00:41:57,808 --> 00:41:58,851
What?

1048
00:41:59,476 --> 00:42:00,477
Evan?

1049
00:42:02,062 --> 00:42:04,815
Wow, this is some kinky shit.
Did you pay for this?

1050
00:42:04,899 --> 00:42:06,275
What is this,
like a doctor thing?

1051
00:42:06,358 --> 00:42:09,236
Are you in a spanking position
or are you doing butt stuff?

1052
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,905
Jason! Jason!
What?

1053
00:42:13,866 --> 00:42:14,909
Shh!

1054
00:42:14,992 --> 00:42:15,993
They drugged me.

1055
00:42:16,118 --> 00:42:17,536
They drugged me.
My whole body is numb.
Shush.

1056
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:18,746
Who is that?
Who just told me to shush?

1057
00:42:18,829 --> 00:42:20,206
Hey, that's Pocahontas.
We used to date...

1058
00:42:20,289 --> 00:42:22,124
I mean, not date, but...

1059
00:42:27,087 --> 00:42:28,297
Pull his pants up,
let's go!

1060
00:42:29,048 --> 00:42:30,299
Pull my pants up!

1061
00:42:30,382 --> 00:42:31,550
Again. Again.
Am I farting?

1062
00:42:31,634 --> 00:42:33,093
Am I farting?
I can't tell.

1063
00:42:35,638 --> 00:42:37,389
Shit! Shit!

1064
00:42:37,473 --> 00:42:39,225
Jason,
I'm not good with heights!

1065
00:42:39,308 --> 00:42:40,309
Okay.

1066
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,229
Ready?
Now you're gonna
tip him towards me.

1067
00:42:43,312 --> 00:42:44,312
Mmm-mmm.

1068
00:42:44,355 --> 00:42:45,940
Okay, she's gonna tip you
and I'm gonna grab your arm.

1069
00:42:46,023 --> 00:42:48,192
When she does that,
you throw your arms out
like a baby alligator,

1070
00:42:48,275 --> 00:42:50,527
and use your weak muscles.
I'll grab your arms.
Ready on three.

1071
00:42:50,611 --> 00:42:52,613
One, two, three!

1072
00:42:55,324 --> 00:42:56,408
No, no, no.

1073
00:42:56,492 --> 00:42:57,492
Oh, no, no, no, no!

1074
00:42:57,534 --> 00:42:58,911
I got you!
Pull me up.

1075
00:42:58,994 --> 00:43:00,474
I've got you!
I've got you!
Pull me up!

1076
00:43:00,537 --> 00:43:02,373
Pull him up! Come on!

1077
00:43:02,456 --> 00:43:04,041
Hold me!
You're not even squeezing!

1078
00:43:04,124 --> 00:43:05,251
I'm fucking paralyzed!

1079
00:43:05,334 --> 00:43:06,614
This has gotta be
a joint effort!

1080
00:43:06,627 --> 00:43:08,170
Oh, my God! Shit! Shit!

1081
00:43:08,254 --> 00:43:10,256
You have to squeeze,
God damn it!

1082
00:43:10,339 --> 00:43:11,924
- Pull me up!
- No, no.

1083
00:43:12,007 --> 00:43:13,926
Oh, no, no!
He's slipping. Slipping.

1084
00:43:15,135 --> 00:43:17,179
Pull him up!
Evan! Evan!

1085
00:43:17,263 --> 00:43:18,514
Get his hand!
No, no.

1086
00:43:18,597 --> 00:43:20,057
No, no, no, no.

1087
00:43:26,981 --> 00:43:28,148
Evan?

1088
00:43:35,322 --> 00:43:36,699
Oh, shit!

1089
00:43:47,376 --> 00:43:48,377
Jason?

1090
00:43:49,003 --> 00:43:50,004
Evan!

1091
00:44:03,225 --> 00:44:04,518
What are you doing?
They're gone!

1092
00:44:04,601 --> 00:44:06,270
We need to pack our stuff
and get out of here.

1093
00:44:06,353 --> 00:44:07,479
You really are
telepathic, Jason!

1094
00:44:07,563 --> 00:44:08,647
Yeah, I know that.

1095
00:44:08,731 --> 00:44:09,940
Here, you relax.

1096
00:44:10,024 --> 00:44:11,191
Oh, shit.
Oh, God, no.

1097
00:44:11,275 --> 00:44:12,818
In terrible odds,
you did it again,

1098
00:44:12,901 --> 00:44:14,820
I wanted you to pick me up
and you read my mind.

1099
00:44:14,903 --> 00:44:16,488
Stay right there.
Thank you.

1100
00:44:16,572 --> 00:44:17,990
I didn't realize
that you were...

1101
00:44:18,407 --> 00:44:19,783
God, you're an idiot!

1102
00:44:24,038 --> 00:44:25,581
Oh, shit.
Is everybody okay?

1103
00:44:26,165 --> 00:44:27,583
Yeah, I'm good.

1104
00:44:28,751 --> 00:44:30,377
Oh, no!

1105
00:44:32,212 --> 00:44:33,339
What? What is it?

1106
00:44:33,422 --> 00:44:34,631
Can you feel this?

1107
00:44:34,715 --> 00:44:36,008
Can I feel what?

1108
00:44:36,091 --> 00:44:37,091
Um...

1109
00:44:37,134 --> 00:44:38,135
Okay.

1110
00:44:40,888 --> 00:44:42,139
Is everybody okay up there?

1111
00:44:42,598 --> 00:44:43,918
Something happened.
What happened?

1112
00:44:43,932 --> 00:44:45,517
Nothing. There was a Cinnabon
with ants on it.

1113
00:44:45,601 --> 00:44:46,852
Oh, yeah,
those can be gross.

1114
00:44:49,229 --> 00:44:51,510
All right, I think he's gone.
I gotta take him to the car.

1115
00:44:51,523 --> 00:44:52,858
I'll help.
No, no, no.

1116
00:44:52,941 --> 00:44:55,861
You've done enough.
This is our battle to fight.

1117
00:44:56,445 --> 00:44:57,780
Goodbye, Pocahontas.

1118
00:44:58,447 --> 00:44:59,448
Goodbye.

1119
00:45:09,792 --> 00:45:12,378
You know my name
isn't really Pocahontas,
right?

1120
00:45:12,961 --> 00:45:14,004
Yeah.

1121
00:45:14,546 --> 00:45:16,548
So say my name.

1122
00:45:17,883 --> 00:45:19,134
Say it.

1123
00:45:20,344 --> 00:45:21,387
Shlerin?

1124
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,138
What?

1125
00:45:23,222 --> 00:45:25,474
Shlerin? It's not?

1126
00:45:29,728 --> 00:45:31,313
Nice to meet you,
Shlerin.

1127
00:45:36,068 --> 00:45:37,778
I think I might've
gone to the bathroom.

1128
00:45:37,861 --> 00:45:39,571
Can you just wait
till we get to the car?

1129
00:45:39,655 --> 00:45:41,865
I am Hugo!
Uh-oh.

1130
00:45:45,202 --> 00:45:46,453
Who is this guy?

1131
00:45:46,537 --> 00:45:48,163
He's the Amazing Hugo.

1132
00:45:48,539 --> 00:45:51,166
And he's an expert
marksman and magician.

1133
00:45:54,586 --> 00:45:56,255
I'm going to
the bathroom again.

1134
00:45:58,006 --> 00:45:59,466
Eat shit, dickhead.

1135
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:06,306
What happened to the car?

1136
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:07,474
Is the car okay?

1137
00:46:07,558 --> 00:46:09,101
I think we can
buff that out.

1138
00:46:22,739 --> 00:46:24,241
Wait, do you smell that?

1139
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:25,701
I can't breathe.

1140
00:46:26,827 --> 00:46:28,662
Do you smell something?

1141
00:46:33,459 --> 00:46:34,710
Get out of the way!

1142
00:46:51,393 --> 00:46:53,479
Oh, my God,
are you okay?

1143
00:46:53,562 --> 00:46:55,230
My whole body is numb.

1144
00:46:55,522 --> 00:46:58,025
Is there any blood?
Do you see any blood?

1145
00:47:02,488 --> 00:47:05,407
Oh, shit.
This car is on fire.
Uh, run!

1146
00:47:05,491 --> 00:47:06,909
Run, run, run!

1147
00:47:06,992 --> 00:47:08,494
Run, run, run!

1148
00:47:14,124 --> 00:47:15,459
Evan?

1149
00:47:17,336 --> 00:47:18,545
Jason?

1150
00:47:18,629 --> 00:47:19,755
Evan, run!

1151
00:47:22,424 --> 00:47:23,592
Oh, there he is!

1152
00:47:25,344 --> 00:47:26,595
Atta boy!

1153
00:47:27,429 --> 00:47:29,014
You're doing great!

1154
00:47:29,097 --> 00:47:31,975
Don't be self-conscious!
Just waddle towards me!

1155
00:47:32,059 --> 00:47:35,062
That's my little penguin!
Keep waddling! Faster!

1156
00:47:36,104 --> 00:47:37,272
That's a penguin!

1157
00:47:37,356 --> 00:47:38,482
I'm doing it!

1158
00:47:38,565 --> 00:47:40,484
That's a penguin!

1159
00:47:41,818 --> 00:47:43,779
Jason! Come get me!

1160
00:47:43,862 --> 00:47:47,115
Does it seem like
it's gonna explode,
like, right now or...

1161
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:48,242
Come get me, Jason!

1162
00:47:48,325 --> 00:47:49,326
Okay!

1163
00:47:50,244 --> 00:47:51,453
All right, here.

1164
00:48:24,653 --> 00:48:26,029
Where's my money?
Huh?

1165
00:48:26,113 --> 00:48:27,656
I'm sorry.
It didn't go through.

1166
00:48:27,739 --> 00:48:29,992
Bullshit! I signed my name,
just like you said!

1167
00:48:30,075 --> 00:48:31,618
Well, maybe I can
send you a check.

1168
00:48:31,702 --> 00:48:33,161
Or do you have
a PayPal account?

1169
00:48:33,245 --> 00:48:35,122
Fuck you!
Give me your wig!

1170
00:48:35,205 --> 00:48:37,457
This is my real hair.

1171
00:48:37,916 --> 00:48:39,209
You got money somewhere.
Ow!

1172
00:48:40,919 --> 00:48:42,254
You got money
in those tights!

1173
00:48:42,337 --> 00:48:44,089
My tights?
I don't have anything
in these tights.

1174
00:48:44,172 --> 00:48:45,549
I have no money!
Don't play me.

1175
00:48:45,632 --> 00:48:47,926
Jesus! I don't have anything.
Please, this is all I have.

1176
00:48:48,010 --> 00:48:49,177
There's no money
in here, I swear.

1177
00:48:49,261 --> 00:48:50,304
Give me the tights!

1178
00:48:50,387 --> 00:48:51,430
No! Ow!

1179
00:48:52,514 --> 00:48:53,640
What the... No!

1180
00:48:54,891 --> 00:48:56,977
What are you doing?
No! No!

1181
00:48:57,436 --> 00:48:59,146
See?
There's nothing in there!

1182
00:48:59,229 --> 00:49:00,230
Are you happy?

1183
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:05,777
This man is attacking me!

1184
00:49:05,861 --> 00:49:07,279
No, I'm not!
I'm not attacking her!

1185
00:49:07,362 --> 00:49:09,562
Don't climb the fence!
You don't need to
climb the fence!

1186
00:49:14,911 --> 00:49:15,912
Out of the way!

1187
00:50:07,422 --> 00:50:10,183
Oh, fuck! Hey, don't shoot me!
Don't shoot me! Oh, God,
don't shoot me!

1188
00:50:12,052 --> 00:50:14,680
Please, this was
an accident. Okay?
I didn't mean to be here.

1189
00:50:14,763 --> 00:50:16,515
No, no, no! Okay, look.

1190
00:50:16,598 --> 00:50:19,434
I will pay you back
for all the cocaine I snorted!

1191
00:50:19,518 --> 00:50:21,478
And you should know,
good job on you guys.

1192
00:50:21,561 --> 00:50:25,190
You have an amazing product!
It's good energy, it's smooth.

1193
00:50:25,273 --> 00:50:28,193
It's speedy,
but it's not jumpy, okay?
It's what I would call

1194
00:50:28,276 --> 00:50:29,528
a sweet-ass high.

1195
00:50:29,611 --> 00:50:31,279
I know for a fact
that it's harder

1196
00:50:31,363 --> 00:50:32,989
to kill someone if
you know them, okay?

1197
00:50:33,073 --> 00:50:34,783
So here's some things
you might not know about me.

1198
00:50:34,866 --> 00:50:37,577
My name is Daniel Narducci.
Everyone calls me Nardo.

1199
00:50:37,661 --> 00:50:40,706
I'm allergic to penicillin.
I love this little girl
called Tracy.

1200
00:50:40,789 --> 00:50:42,249
She's a hot little number,

1201
00:50:42,332 --> 00:50:44,626
and she fucking dishes it out
anytime she wants.

1202
00:50:49,715 --> 00:50:51,383
...and she goes
to Dave & Buster's,
we both go,

1203
00:50:51,466 --> 00:50:52,843
and play arcade games,
all of them.

1204
00:50:52,926 --> 00:50:55,387
Pinball, <i>Time Crisis II</i>
with all the popping
up and down,

1205
00:50:55,470 --> 00:50:56,555
and all of those shooter...

1206
00:50:56,638 --> 00:50:59,099
I'm not shooting you,
it's fake. It's... It's fake.

1207
00:50:59,182 --> 00:51:01,059
And she wears vegan shoes,
that's cute.

1208
00:51:01,143 --> 00:51:02,894
What?

1209
00:51:03,228 --> 00:51:05,272
I can't understand you.

1210
00:51:05,355 --> 00:51:06,773
No, no, I'm not
going down there.

1211
00:51:08,233 --> 00:51:09,860
Down! Okay, I got it!

1212
00:51:16,742 --> 00:51:17,826
It's all back.

1213
00:51:18,326 --> 00:51:20,078
Look, here's some more things.
Here's some more things.

1214
00:51:20,162 --> 00:51:22,122
I hope to one day be
a licensed reseller

1215
00:51:22,205 --> 00:51:23,498
of above-ground
Jacuzzis, right?

1216
00:51:23,582 --> 00:51:26,084
They're called Jacuzzis,
I'm called Nardo,

1217
00:51:26,168 --> 00:51:27,586
and together
they're Narduzzis.

1218
00:51:27,669 --> 00:51:30,797
"Come over to Narduzzi's
and we'll wade in
the warm water."

1219
00:51:30,881 --> 00:51:32,081
Like, "Welcome to Narduzzi's."

1220
00:51:47,856 --> 00:51:50,776
<i>Could you just</i>
<i>please tell MacDonaldson</i>
<i>I am sorry I missed the steam,</i>

1221
00:51:50,859 --> 00:51:52,319
<i>but I will be at the meeting.
I promise.</i>

1222
00:51:52,402 --> 00:51:54,446
Did you try to take
out a cash advance
on the company card

1223
00:51:54,529 --> 00:51:56,990
at an Indian casino
at 3:00 this morning?

1224
00:51:57,073 --> 00:51:58,200
How do you know that?
Wait.

1225
00:51:59,409 --> 00:52:01,169
This is MacDonaldson.
I'm gonna patch you in.

1226
00:52:01,203 --> 00:52:02,287
No, no,
don't patch in MacDonaldson.

1227
00:52:02,370 --> 00:52:03,830
<i>Evan?</i>
Hello, sir.

1228
00:52:03,914 --> 00:52:05,832
<i>I am so sorry</i>
<i>I missed the steam</i>
<i>this morning, but I...</i>

1229
00:52:05,916 --> 00:52:07,292
Did you try to take
out a cash advance

1230
00:52:07,375 --> 00:52:08,752
on the company card
at 3:00 a.m.?

1231
00:52:08,835 --> 00:52:12,172
I didn't want to
get into this with you
so quickly, but the...

1232
00:52:12,255 --> 00:52:14,549
The truth is
I was out all night
with the Nakatomi guys.

1233
00:52:14,633 --> 00:52:16,343
<i>You know me,
all about the hustle.</i>

1234
00:52:16,426 --> 00:52:18,887
And these Japanese businessmen
like to party.

1235
00:52:18,970 --> 00:52:20,430
<i>Just like the stereotype.</i>

1236
00:52:20,555 --> 00:52:23,225
I like this one.
Can you make her feet smaller?

1237
00:52:23,308 --> 00:52:24,351
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1238
00:52:24,434 --> 00:52:26,686
Evan, it's one thing
to chase new business

1239
00:52:26,770 --> 00:52:29,231
and it's another thing
to blow a presentation
with our biggest client.

1240
00:52:29,314 --> 00:52:30,357
I know. I'm sorry, sir.

1241
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:33,652
Now, you listen here.
You be here at 2:00.

1242
00:52:33,735 --> 00:52:35,445
And, Evan,

1243
00:52:35,529 --> 00:52:37,447
this is your last chance.

1244
00:52:37,531 --> 00:52:38,907
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

1245
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:41,827
Thank you for that.

1246
00:52:41,910 --> 00:52:43,620
Face it, Evan,
you're kind of
at a turning point.

1247
00:52:43,703 --> 00:52:45,497
Pretty soon,
you're gonna become
one of those drones

1248
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:47,500
that goes to lunch
and asks if they
have boba tea.

1249
00:52:47,582 --> 00:52:48,834
You're gonna
drink boba tea.

1250
00:52:48,917 --> 00:52:50,335
Okay, despite what
you may think,

1251
00:52:50,418 --> 00:52:52,212
I actually love
what I do.

1252
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:53,839
You think I'm a failure?

1253
00:52:53,922 --> 00:52:57,342
Look in the mirror, pal.
Your life is a joke
on every level.

1254
00:52:57,425 --> 00:52:58,593
You know what?
Say what you want,

1255
00:52:58,677 --> 00:53:00,011
but at least
I care about my friends.

1256
00:53:00,095 --> 00:53:01,680
Is that why you
destroyed Nardo's life?

1257
00:53:01,763 --> 00:53:03,765
Hey, he shouldn't marry Tracy
and you know it.

1258
00:53:03,849 --> 00:53:06,059
You're just afraid to
admit it because you're
a fucking coward!

1259
00:53:06,142 --> 00:53:07,519
Okay.

1260
00:53:07,602 --> 00:53:09,104
I'm a coward?
Yeah, you are.

1261
00:53:09,187 --> 00:53:12,357
You know, it's not easy
to stop a wedding.
And I had to do it alone.

1262
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:13,984
I could've used
your help, friend.

1263
00:53:14,067 --> 00:53:16,862
The only reason
you don't want Nardo
to get married is

1264
00:53:16,945 --> 00:53:18,280
'cause you don't wanna
lose your friend.

1265
00:53:18,363 --> 00:53:19,447
That's not true.

1266
00:53:19,531 --> 00:53:21,783
Everybody's
moving on without you.
Boo-hoo!

1267
00:53:21,950 --> 00:53:23,326
Grow the fuck up!

1268
00:53:23,410 --> 00:53:25,412
What, so you're saying
now I have to like Tracy?

1269
00:53:25,495 --> 00:53:27,914
No. You have to
love Tracy.

1270
00:53:30,792 --> 00:53:33,336
Hey, you boys didn't happen
to blow up a car

1271
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:35,213
and leave the scene
of an accident, did you?

1272
00:53:35,297 --> 00:53:37,299
We didn't leave...
Blow up, like explode?

1273
00:53:37,382 --> 00:53:39,302
Yeah, we don't know
anything about a Ford Taurus.

1274
00:53:41,303 --> 00:53:42,512
Hey, please, please,

1275
00:53:42,596 --> 00:53:44,973
don't stuff my
corpse with drugs
and send it to my Grammy!

1276
00:53:47,642 --> 00:53:49,185
What the fuck?

1277
00:54:00,196 --> 00:54:02,616
What? What are we...
What are we doing now?

1278
00:54:26,014 --> 00:54:28,016
How you doing? I'm Berk.

1279
00:54:28,558 --> 00:54:29,935
Put it there.

1280
00:54:30,018 --> 00:54:31,436
I'm tied.
These guys tied me up.

1281
00:54:31,519 --> 00:54:34,022
A man come in your house
and can't shake
your fucking hand?

1282
00:54:34,105 --> 00:54:35,357
Motherfucker, I'm Berk!

1283
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:36,650
They tied me up.

1284
00:54:36,733 --> 00:54:38,276
We got a problem.

1285
00:54:39,069 --> 00:54:42,113
We got big <i>problemo.</i>

1286
00:54:43,031 --> 00:54:45,951
That shit was supposed to be
in South Padre tomorrow.

1287
00:54:46,034 --> 00:54:47,285
But instead,

1288
00:54:47,369 --> 00:54:49,704
it's caked to
somebody's balls.

1289
00:54:49,788 --> 00:54:52,832
Not his balls,
not his balls,
not my balls.

1290
00:54:53,208 --> 00:54:54,376
Your balls.

1291
00:54:54,459 --> 00:54:57,337
You can't wear
a man's cocaine around.

1292
00:54:57,420 --> 00:54:59,005
I'm about sick of this shit.
Give me your gun.

1293
00:54:59,089 --> 00:55:00,924
Oh, no.
Oh, no?

1294
00:55:01,007 --> 00:55:02,300
Oh, yes, motherfucker.

1295
00:55:02,384 --> 00:55:03,718
Please don't! Please don't!

1296
00:55:04,552 --> 00:55:06,596
Want my vest?
You want it?

1297
00:55:06,721 --> 00:55:08,890
What?
You want my vest?

1298
00:55:08,974 --> 00:55:11,017
Protect yourself?
Yeah, yeah, please.

1299
00:55:11,101 --> 00:55:12,602
Oh, fucking Christ!

1300
00:55:13,019 --> 00:55:14,896
Your hair went up
in the back. Your hair
said, "Whoo-whoo!"

1301
00:55:15,271 --> 00:55:17,482
Okay, look.
Look, Berk. Mr. Berk.

1302
00:55:17,565 --> 00:55:19,651
Mr. Berk,
I'm... I'm sorry.

1303
00:55:25,365 --> 00:55:26,992
You are not fucking Spanish.

1304
00:55:27,075 --> 00:55:28,952
We are fucking Spanish.

1305
00:55:29,369 --> 00:55:30,578
You're Spanish?

1306
00:55:30,662 --> 00:55:34,332
You have the fucking guts
to question if I'm Spanish?

1307
00:55:34,416 --> 00:55:36,835
You just don't...
You don't have
a Spanish quality about you.

1308
00:55:37,544 --> 00:55:40,005
<i>Uno, dos, tres,</i>
motherfucker!

1309
00:55:41,423 --> 00:55:43,633
Okay. Sorry.
Normal "sorry."

1310
00:55:52,267 --> 00:55:54,185
Sucks they took our phones.

1311
00:55:54,269 --> 00:55:56,813
Is my ass bleeding?
Um...

1312
00:55:57,814 --> 00:55:59,774
Evan, a lot of things
happened today...

1313
00:55:59,858 --> 00:56:01,651
Your bail's been posted.

1314
00:56:01,776 --> 00:56:03,028
Really?

1315
00:56:03,987 --> 00:56:05,822
Do we get our phones back?
We'll see.

1316
00:56:05,905 --> 00:56:07,745
I just wanna say
I've learned
a valuable lesson.

1317
00:56:07,782 --> 00:56:09,701
Yeah, don't,
don't touch me.

1318
00:56:12,328 --> 00:56:15,040
You do realize you've
put me in a ridiculous
position here, right?

1319
00:56:15,123 --> 00:56:16,916
Yes, I'm sorry,
but I appreciate
everything you've done.

1320
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,877
We have a meeting
in three hours.

1321
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,962
Were you really not gonna
tell me you were on
your way to Mexico?

1322
00:56:21,046 --> 00:56:22,714
I had everything
under control.

1323
00:56:22,797 --> 00:56:23,798
You're an idiot.

1324
00:56:23,882 --> 00:56:27,052
So, what's the plan now,
boys? You guys gonna
walk down to Mexico?

1325
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:28,428
She's right.
We should borrow her car.

1326
00:56:28,511 --> 00:56:30,055
Not gonna happen!

1327
00:56:30,138 --> 00:56:32,557
Wait, we just need
to get down there and
then we'll get right back.

1328
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,100
Down where exactly?

1329
00:56:34,184 --> 00:56:36,102
Tracy's on her honeymoon
right now in Mexico.

1330
00:56:36,186 --> 00:56:38,438
Nardo said he was gonna
do everything in his power
to get down there.

1331
00:56:38,521 --> 00:56:40,440
So all we have to do
is go down to Mexico,

1332
00:56:40,523 --> 00:56:43,568
keep our heads on a swivel,
and rescue Nardo.

1333
00:56:43,651 --> 00:56:45,612
Yeah, you can take
the Tijuana Trolley.

1334
00:56:45,695 --> 00:56:46,946
It makes a stop
in Los Angeles.

1335
00:56:46,988 --> 00:56:49,908
"Take the trolley."
That's their slogan.
Mmm-hmm.

1336
00:56:49,991 --> 00:56:51,785
It's on the front.
Well, I never rode it.

1337
00:56:51,868 --> 00:56:53,912
No.
But it's reliable,
I've heard.

1338
00:56:54,245 --> 00:56:55,914
I'm sorry, guys.

1339
00:56:55,997 --> 00:56:57,290
You owe me $900
in court fees.

1340
00:56:57,373 --> 00:56:58,625
Wait, wait, wait.

1341
00:56:59,334 --> 00:57:01,134
There is something
I need you to do, actually.

1342
00:57:01,169 --> 00:57:02,545
Do you think you could
run back in there,

1343
00:57:02,629 --> 00:57:05,924
and get this
stamped and processed
on the second floor?

1344
00:57:06,007 --> 00:57:08,009
I'm adding this
to your bill.

1345
00:57:11,137 --> 00:57:12,514
Let's go.
Where'd you get those?

1346
00:57:12,597 --> 00:57:14,037
I took them from her purse.
I had to!

1347
00:57:14,057 --> 00:57:16,017
You drive.
I'm sliding across the hood.

1348
00:57:19,104 --> 00:57:20,355
Whoo-hoo!

1349
00:57:21,606 --> 00:57:23,316
No, no. No, no!

1350
00:57:23,733 --> 00:57:24,901
Hey!

1351
00:57:24,984 --> 00:57:27,779
My fucking laptop
is in there!

1352
00:57:27,862 --> 00:57:29,239
My laptop's in there!

1353
00:57:29,322 --> 00:57:31,616
I'm sorry! I had to!

1354
00:57:31,699 --> 00:57:33,201
Here, here!
Soft landing!

1355
00:57:37,038 --> 00:57:38,373
Idiots!

1356
00:57:43,711 --> 00:57:46,172
I say we fill
his corpse with drugs

1357
00:57:46,256 --> 00:57:48,049
and send it back
to his Grammy!

1358
00:57:48,133 --> 00:57:49,259
Wait a minute, man.

1359
00:57:49,342 --> 00:57:50,844
You're gonna fill
a body up with drugs

1360
00:57:50,927 --> 00:57:52,387
and send it to
someone's Grammy?

1361
00:57:56,766 --> 00:58:00,061
Grammies are
good for apple pies
and tucking you in bed.

1362
00:58:00,145 --> 00:58:02,647
And... And breast-feeding you
when your mom's not around!

1363
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:04,149
You don't do that
to a Grammy!

1364
00:58:04,649 --> 00:58:06,693
We don't do that
to Grammies!

1365
00:58:09,737 --> 00:58:10,780
Let me tell you something.

1366
00:58:10,864 --> 00:58:14,325
This motherfucker right here
works for Chucho.

1367
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:24,127
What's he doing?

1368
00:58:24,794 --> 00:58:26,254
What the fuck you doing?

1369
00:58:36,431 --> 00:58:37,473
Oh...

1370
00:58:42,896 --> 00:58:43,896
Oh, shit!

1371
00:58:43,938 --> 00:58:45,273
Shit, shit, shit!

1372
00:58:45,356 --> 00:58:46,524
Fuck!

1373
00:58:58,203 --> 00:58:59,603
Ahh! Don't shoot me!
Don't shoot me!

1374
00:59:11,299 --> 00:59:13,218
I'm out. I'm out!

1375
00:59:13,801 --> 00:59:17,472
Whoo! Yeah! Yes! Yes!

1376
00:59:17,555 --> 00:59:18,890
Whoo!

1377
00:59:18,973 --> 00:59:20,808
Where am I going?

1378
00:59:20,892 --> 00:59:22,310
Fucker!

1379
00:59:23,561 --> 00:59:24,812
Hold on.

1380
00:59:25,438 --> 00:59:26,689
Why's he coming back?

1381
00:59:27,148 --> 00:59:28,566
Tracy, here I come!

1382
00:59:28,650 --> 00:59:30,318
Yeah, I made it,
motherfuckers!

1383
00:59:30,401 --> 00:59:32,320
We're gonna
get married, Tracy!

1384
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:35,531
Whoo! Yeah!
I fucking won, baby!

1385
00:59:36,658 --> 00:59:38,660
Don't stop loving me!

1386
00:59:40,328 --> 00:59:41,496
I won!

1387
00:59:41,788 --> 00:59:42,914
Yes!

1388
00:59:42,997 --> 00:59:44,332
Fuck you, Berk!

1389
00:59:49,629 --> 00:59:51,965
Oh, shit. I'm sorry.

1390
01:00:12,193 --> 01:00:14,195
Okay, I need a map.

1391
01:00:23,955 --> 01:00:26,165
Okay. Wow. I'm high.

1392
01:00:45,351 --> 01:00:46,352
What's this?

1393
01:00:47,562 --> 01:00:49,897
Okay, that's the highway!
Okay, okay, okay!

1394
01:00:49,981 --> 01:00:51,357
Indicator!

1395
01:00:51,441 --> 01:00:53,234
I'm coming for you, Tracy!

1396
01:00:53,318 --> 01:00:54,902
I'm coming for you!

1397
01:01:07,498 --> 01:01:09,751
This thing fits pretty good,
but I don't know,

1398
01:01:09,834 --> 01:01:11,044
feels like there's
a lot going on, doesn't it?

1399
01:01:11,127 --> 01:01:13,463
Oh, let me see it,
turn around.
Yeah, buddy, that's fire.

1400
01:01:13,546 --> 01:01:14,630
That's iguana fire.

1401
01:01:14,714 --> 01:01:16,090
My treat.
I'm paying for it.

1402
01:01:16,174 --> 01:01:17,175
I already paid for it.

1403
01:01:17,258 --> 01:01:18,634
I'll pay you back
when we get home.

1404
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:20,887
That's not a treat.
Okay.

1405
01:01:22,388 --> 01:01:24,724
Let's ride.
Let's do this.

1406
01:01:29,437 --> 01:01:31,773
Where is Nardo?
He should've
been here by now.

1407
01:01:31,856 --> 01:01:34,776
I mean,
the least attractive
girl here is an eight,

1408
01:01:34,859 --> 01:01:36,694
and that's only because
she's wearing a neck brace.

1409
01:01:36,778 --> 01:01:39,197
Hey, hey! Head in the game.
We're looking for our friend.

1410
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:40,760
Look, look. Look,
she's looking at me.

1411
01:01:40,823 --> 01:01:42,241
She can't move her head.

1412
01:01:42,950 --> 01:01:44,077
Now she's looking at me.

1413
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:45,453
No, she's not.

1414
01:01:49,707 --> 01:01:50,750
Jason!
Okay.

1415
01:01:52,293 --> 01:01:53,878
That's enough lotion,
thank you.

1416
01:01:56,297 --> 01:01:58,466
Tracy. Tracy.

1417
01:01:58,549 --> 01:01:59,550
Evan?

1418
01:02:01,677 --> 01:02:03,054
How'd you two get here?

1419
01:02:03,137 --> 01:02:04,722
Primarily by smart car.

1420
01:02:04,806 --> 01:02:07,433
Have you talked to Nardo?
No!

1421
01:02:07,517 --> 01:02:10,353
We broke up because
of you two assholes.

1422
01:02:10,436 --> 01:02:12,480
Or did you forget that?
Tracy...

1423
01:02:12,563 --> 01:02:14,357
Do you have any idea
what it feels like

1424
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:16,776
to be stood up and humiliated
at your own wedding?

1425
01:02:17,610 --> 01:02:20,196
My life is a disaster
because of you two.

1426
01:02:20,279 --> 01:02:24,450
What happened was a mistake,
and Nardo feels really
bad and he loves you.

1427
01:02:24,534 --> 01:02:25,785
Oh, my God.

1428
01:02:27,703 --> 01:02:28,996
Tracy.

1429
01:02:29,330 --> 01:02:30,581
Tracy.

1430
01:02:31,457 --> 01:02:33,084
Tracy.

1431
01:02:33,167 --> 01:02:34,210
Tracy.
What?

1432
01:02:34,293 --> 01:02:36,337
Tracy, wait.
Why are you fighting for me?

1433
01:02:36,421 --> 01:02:38,089
You don't even like me.

1434
01:02:38,589 --> 01:02:39,966
I like you.
No, you don't.

1435
01:02:40,341 --> 01:02:43,678
If you liked me,
you never would've let
Jason go through with that.

1436
01:02:43,970 --> 01:02:45,763
Fine. You know what?

1437
01:02:45,847 --> 01:02:48,266
I should've
stopped him. Okay?

1438
01:02:48,349 --> 01:02:50,643
I guess I didn't
because part of me thought

1439
01:02:50,726 --> 01:02:52,326
that Jason might've
been right about you.

1440
01:02:52,478 --> 01:02:53,980
But things are
different now.

1441
01:02:54,063 --> 01:02:57,191
I never knew how
much Nardo loved you.
But I do now.

1442
01:02:57,275 --> 01:03:00,319
Nardo believes in you.
He's on his way here
right now, I promise.

1443
01:03:01,237 --> 01:03:03,448
Tell him I said goodbye.

1444
01:03:03,990 --> 01:03:05,366
Tracy!

1445
01:03:09,871 --> 01:03:10,997
Shit.

1446
01:03:15,626 --> 01:03:18,504
I'm coming for you, Tracy!
I'm coming for you!

1447
01:03:19,881 --> 01:03:21,257
How do I turn this off?

1448
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:25,720
God, that's loud! That's loud!
Why is it so loud?

1449
01:03:28,139 --> 01:03:30,224
Shut the fuck up! God!

1450
01:03:36,397 --> 01:03:38,316
Fuck! Oh, my God!

1451
01:03:41,152 --> 01:03:42,945
Oh! Ahh! Ow!

1452
01:03:47,742 --> 01:03:50,578
Hi. I'm checking out
of the honeymoon suite.

1453
01:04:12,183 --> 01:04:14,727
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. Was that your...

1454
01:04:16,896 --> 01:04:17,897
Tracy?

1455
01:04:20,441 --> 01:04:22,860
Tracy! Tracy!

1456
01:04:24,028 --> 01:04:25,196
Tracy!

1457
01:04:36,123 --> 01:04:38,292
<i>Mr. MacDonaldson,
you have a call on line one.</i>

1458
01:04:39,627 --> 01:04:41,629
Hello?
Sir, hi. It's Evan.

1459
01:04:41,712 --> 01:04:42,964
Evan, where are you?

1460
01:04:43,047 --> 01:04:44,799
<i>The presentation
has been moved to 5:00,</i>

1461
01:04:44,882 --> 01:04:47,718
so that gives us three hours
till we have to get it
together to present.

1462
01:04:47,802 --> 01:04:49,220
<i>Sir, Elizabeth on two.</i>

1463
01:04:49,303 --> 01:04:50,638
Hold on, this is
Elizabeth calling now.

1464
01:04:50,721 --> 01:04:51,722
Let me see if I
can patch her in.

1465
01:04:51,806 --> 01:04:52,807
Oh, don't do that.

1466
01:04:52,890 --> 01:04:54,267
Hello, Elizabeth.
Did this work?

1467
01:04:54,517 --> 01:04:56,894
<i>Hello?</i>
Evan?

1468
01:04:56,978 --> 01:04:58,396
Hey, Elizabeth.

1469
01:04:58,479 --> 01:05:00,398
Evan, I'd very much
like to speak to you

1470
01:05:00,481 --> 01:05:02,733
face to face about our
transportation issue.

1471
01:05:02,817 --> 01:05:06,028
Right. I very much
would like to thank you
for all that you have... Oh.

1472
01:05:07,321 --> 01:05:09,241
I'm sorry, I'm getting a call.
It's an emergency.

1473
01:05:09,323 --> 01:05:11,742
No one is hanging up
until I know exactly
what's going on.

1474
01:05:11,826 --> 01:05:14,453
I'm sorry, sir.
It's an emergency,
I have to go.

1475
01:05:14,537 --> 01:05:16,038
I'll see you at 5:00.

1476
01:05:16,122 --> 01:05:17,122
- Hello?
<i>- Evan!</i>

1477
01:05:17,164 --> 01:05:18,457
Nardo! Where are you?

1478
01:05:18,541 --> 01:05:20,585
I'm in a fucking
Mexican jail, man!

1479
01:05:20,668 --> 01:05:22,753
What?
I'm in a Mexican jail.

1480
01:05:22,837 --> 01:05:24,088
<i>Hello?</i>

1481
01:05:24,171 --> 01:05:25,965
Wait. Now, who's this?

1482
01:05:26,048 --> 01:05:27,425
<i>Sir?</i>
Who's on the line?

1483
01:05:27,508 --> 01:05:30,595
It's fucking Nardo and
I'm in a Mexican jail!
Who the fuck is this?

1484
01:05:30,678 --> 01:05:33,681
Okay, Nardo,
if you could please hang up
and call me back...

1485
01:05:33,764 --> 01:05:35,933
Are you kidding me?
They're only giving me
one phone call here!

1486
01:05:36,017 --> 01:05:37,059
I'm a dead man!

1487
01:05:37,143 --> 01:05:39,937
These fucking phones.
Elizabeth,
what line are you on?

1488
01:05:40,021 --> 01:05:41,147
- I'm here...
<i>- Nardo,</i>

1489
01:05:41,230 --> 01:05:43,274
uh, tell me which jail
you are in right now.

1490
01:05:43,357 --> 01:05:45,276
Sir, if you could
just please hang up.

1491
01:05:45,359 --> 01:05:47,987
Do not fucking...
Do not hang up
on me, Evan!

1492
01:05:48,070 --> 01:05:49,947
Elizabeth?
Nardo, which jail
are you in?

1493
01:05:50,031 --> 01:05:51,699
My poncho says
"Rosarito 17" on it.

1494
01:05:51,782 --> 01:05:53,117
Okay, great!

1495
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:54,520
<i>Evan!</i>
Okay, we will be there soon!

1496
01:05:54,535 --> 01:05:56,662
There's someone's blood
on this phone, Evan!

1497
01:05:56,746 --> 01:05:58,226
- Sir, I will see you at 5:00.
<i>- Okay.</i>

1498
01:05:58,289 --> 01:05:59,449
No, no, no, no!
Wait a minute!

1499
01:05:59,498 --> 01:06:00,625
Evan, you're the man!

1500
01:06:00,708 --> 01:06:01,792
<i>Do not hang up on me, Evan!</i>

1501
01:06:08,215 --> 01:06:09,508
Hello?

1502
01:06:09,592 --> 01:06:10,635
<i>Hello?</i>

1503
01:06:11,427 --> 01:06:13,054
Hey, hi.
<i>Who's this?</i>

1504
01:06:13,137 --> 01:06:14,388
Well, who are you?

1505
01:06:14,472 --> 01:06:16,182
This is Kyle MacDonaldson.

1506
01:06:16,265 --> 01:06:18,684
You've got a great
speaking voice.
Are you black?

1507
01:06:18,768 --> 01:06:20,353
<i>What's that...
What's that like?</i>

1508
01:06:20,436 --> 01:06:22,229
Nice meeting you!

1509
01:06:28,736 --> 01:06:30,176
<i>Hey, what's up?
You've reached Tracy.</i>

1510
01:06:30,237 --> 01:06:31,405
<i>If you'd like to
leave a message,</i>

1511
01:06:31,489 --> 01:06:34,450
<i>feel free to do so while I
drink margaritas. What?</i>

1512
01:06:34,533 --> 01:06:36,661
Tracy, it's Evan.
I know you're pissed.

1513
01:06:36,744 --> 01:06:40,373
It's just...
Nardo is in serious trouble,

1514
01:06:41,165 --> 01:06:43,417
and we're at
the police station,
Rosarito 17.

1515
01:06:44,460 --> 01:06:47,463
We really need your help
and your credit card.
Thank you.

1516
01:06:47,922 --> 01:06:50,925
Should we save
the donkey, too?
I like you.

1517
01:06:51,759 --> 01:06:53,511
This is so crazy.

1518
01:06:53,594 --> 01:06:55,596
How are we gonna get
Nardo out of here?

1519
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:57,181
I don't know.
Maybe we bribe them?

1520
01:06:57,264 --> 01:06:59,058
Mexican cops don't
make a lot of money,

1521
01:06:59,141 --> 01:07:01,560
so they'd for sure
go for a bribe.

1522
01:07:03,354 --> 01:07:04,605
What is that?

1523
01:07:04,689 --> 01:07:06,357
It's a stick,
in case we need it in there.

1524
01:07:07,108 --> 01:07:08,859
We are not breaking Nardo
out of a Mexican jail

1525
01:07:08,943 --> 01:07:11,070
with fucking sticks.

1526
01:07:11,153 --> 01:07:13,489
We'll run game on them.
Let's do the "we got beef."

1527
01:07:13,948 --> 01:07:16,367
No, we are not gonna
do the "we got beef."

1528
01:07:16,450 --> 01:07:17,970
Why not? It works.
It doesn't even work

1529
01:07:18,035 --> 01:07:19,662
on drunk girls
on spring break.

1530
01:07:19,745 --> 01:07:20,996
It worked at Arizona State.

1531
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:22,790
Everything works
at Arizona State.

1532
01:07:22,873 --> 01:07:24,291
That's true.

1533
01:07:25,292 --> 01:07:27,420
Can I get
a Diet Coke, please?

1534
01:07:27,503 --> 01:07:29,130
You probably
don't even have diet!

1535
01:07:31,882 --> 01:07:33,634
Animals!

1536
01:07:34,969 --> 01:07:36,262
Excuse us, gentlemen.

1537
01:07:36,345 --> 01:07:38,973
Do you have a prisoner here
by the name of Nardo?

1538
01:07:39,056 --> 01:07:41,058
Daniel Narducci,
maybe you booked him under?

1539
01:07:41,142 --> 01:07:43,519
Evan! Jason!
Oh, thank God you're here!

1540
01:07:43,602 --> 01:07:45,104
Nardo! Nardo!
Nardo! Nardo!

1541
01:07:45,187 --> 01:07:46,313
No, no, no!

1542
01:07:46,397 --> 01:07:47,523
Hey, man!

1543
01:07:47,606 --> 01:07:48,649
Behind the line.

1544
01:07:49,108 --> 01:07:51,235
Yeah, there's a chalk
line, Evan.
Evan!

1545
01:07:51,318 --> 01:07:54,071
Jason! These two
have been torturing me!

1546
01:07:54,155 --> 01:07:55,906
We haven't been
torturing you.

1547
01:07:55,990 --> 01:07:58,367
Well, he was licking me!

1548
01:07:59,243 --> 01:08:00,953
Have you been licking him?

1549
01:08:03,456 --> 01:08:07,626
I'm so fucked up
right now. Yeah.

1550
01:08:07,710 --> 01:08:09,503
He licked me right here.

1551
01:08:09,587 --> 01:08:10,987
And then he licked
me here and here.

1552
01:08:11,672 --> 01:08:13,924
Look, here's what
we're gonna do.

1553
01:08:14,341 --> 01:08:16,510
You guys are
gonna give us Nardo

1554
01:08:16,594 --> 01:08:18,637
and we will make it
worth your while.

1555
01:08:18,721 --> 01:08:21,015
Yeah. We're gonna bribe you.

1556
01:08:21,098 --> 01:08:22,224
Oh, my God.

1557
01:08:22,308 --> 01:08:24,602
No, we can't do that.
He's part of the deal.

1558
01:08:24,685 --> 01:08:26,812
Berk is on his way over...

1559
01:08:28,814 --> 01:08:30,733
Wait, did you say "Berk"?

1560
01:08:30,816 --> 01:08:31,942
Berk hates me, okay?

1561
01:08:32,026 --> 01:08:33,652
He's after me!

1562
01:08:33,736 --> 01:08:35,029
I stole a truck
full of his cocaine.

1563
01:08:35,112 --> 01:08:36,822
This is all a big
misunderstanding.

1564
01:08:36,906 --> 01:08:38,574
Nardo is not a drug runner.

1565
01:08:38,657 --> 01:08:40,201
I mean, look at him. He...

1566
01:08:40,284 --> 01:08:43,370
He could barely run,
little fella.
Look at me.

1567
01:08:43,996 --> 01:08:47,166
Look at him,
he's a foppish dandy.
He's a fop.

1568
01:08:47,249 --> 01:08:49,460
He's innocent, you know.
He's a little baby.

1569
01:08:49,543 --> 01:08:51,045
Little
<i>Pig in the City.</i>

1570
01:08:51,128 --> 01:08:52,546
Yeah, he's a
<i>Pig in the City.</i>

1571
01:08:52,630 --> 01:08:54,340
Ever seen that
movie? Did you guys get
that down here?

1572
01:08:54,423 --> 01:08:56,801
Yeah, I'm a little Babe.
"That'll do."

1573
01:08:56,884 --> 01:08:58,469
He can talk, the whole thing.

1574
01:08:58,552 --> 01:09:01,305
<i>Pig in the Cities.</i>

1575
01:09:01,472 --> 01:09:03,098
I think we all do.
Yeah.

1576
01:09:03,182 --> 01:09:07,144
I saw
<i>Pigs in the City</i>
on Christmas time.

1577
01:09:07,228 --> 01:09:09,980
Oh, it made my heart
feel warm and...

1578
01:09:10,064 --> 01:09:11,565
I love it so much.

1579
01:09:12,024 --> 01:09:13,651
You ever see
the first one?

1580
01:09:14,568 --> 01:09:16,570
There's a first one?

1581
01:09:17,738 --> 01:09:20,866
Oh, my God,
my life is a lies.

1582
01:09:21,408 --> 01:09:24,787
You know, I think
it's time for you
two guys to leave.

1583
01:09:24,870 --> 01:09:26,205
Before you get hurt.

1584
01:09:26,497 --> 01:09:29,208
I don't know
what you guys are
trying to pull here.

1585
01:09:29,291 --> 01:09:31,836
But the United States,
we come down pretty hard.

1586
01:09:31,919 --> 01:09:34,421
Iraq I, Iraq II...

1587
01:09:34,547 --> 01:09:37,341
This is all
your fault, Evan!
What are you doing?

1588
01:09:37,424 --> 01:09:39,593
We got beef!
No, we don't have beef.

1589
01:09:39,677 --> 01:09:41,512
We don't have beefs!
Not the beef.

1590
01:09:41,595 --> 01:09:43,430
Yeah, yeah, come on.
Let's do the "we
got beef" thing.

1591
01:09:43,514 --> 01:09:45,599
That's not gonna
work on two <i>federales.</i>
Yes, it will.

1592
01:09:45,683 --> 01:09:47,226
Look, look, look. The gun.

1593
01:09:48,018 --> 01:09:49,186
We said we weren't
gonna do this.

1594
01:09:49,270 --> 01:09:50,312
You son of a bitch!

1595
01:09:50,437 --> 01:09:53,774
You better watch that ass!
You'll see me kick it!

1596
01:09:54,525 --> 01:09:56,861
Okay, kangaroo punch
coming, nice and easy.

1597
01:09:56,944 --> 01:09:58,070
Ready?
No kangaroo.

1598
01:09:58,487 --> 01:09:59,572
Fuck you!

1599
01:09:59,655 --> 01:10:02,032
What did you call me?
A pussy mouth?

1600
01:10:02,116 --> 01:10:03,909
You are a fucking idiot!

1601
01:10:03,993 --> 01:10:05,744
Yeah, I'm mad at you, too!

1602
01:10:08,205 --> 01:10:09,206
Okay, time out, guys.

1603
01:10:09,290 --> 01:10:10,457
Fuck you!

1604
01:10:11,834 --> 01:10:13,544
Oh!

1605
01:10:13,878 --> 01:10:16,630
The only reason
that I have lived
with you this long

1606
01:10:16,714 --> 01:10:18,549
is because I felt guilty!

1607
01:10:18,632 --> 01:10:20,509
- Let it out, Evan.
- I am done...

1608
01:10:20,593 --> 01:10:22,193
That's good.
...taking care of your shit!

1609
01:10:29,393 --> 01:10:30,394
Are you okay?

1610
01:10:39,278 --> 01:10:41,071
Did you not see
that I had the gun?

1611
01:10:41,155 --> 01:10:42,156
You did?

1612
01:10:42,615 --> 01:10:44,033
We are done.

1613
01:10:44,116 --> 01:10:46,410
You and me, we are done!

1614
01:10:46,493 --> 01:10:48,203
I'm gonna murder you!
No, you're not!

1615
01:10:48,662 --> 01:10:50,122
For real!
I'm gonna murder...

1616
01:10:57,838 --> 01:10:59,173
What the hell is going on?

1617
01:11:00,591 --> 01:11:03,594
Tracy. Hi.

1618
01:11:04,011 --> 01:11:05,429
There you are.

1619
01:11:05,512 --> 01:11:07,514
I'm a bit strung out
right now. I'm sorry.

1620
01:11:14,688 --> 01:11:15,814
Yeah, Tracy.

1621
01:11:18,692 --> 01:11:20,361
In! Out!

1622
01:11:22,696 --> 01:11:24,865
Hey! Hi! Yeah!

1623
01:11:28,661 --> 01:11:31,121
Tracy. Tracy!
Let me go! Tracy!

1624
01:11:31,205 --> 01:11:32,957
Nardo, I just came here
to help you, that's it.

1625
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:34,375
I know, I know. Look.

1626
01:11:34,792 --> 01:11:36,794
Tracy, I love you.

1627
01:11:37,461 --> 01:11:38,671
Okay?

1628
01:11:38,754 --> 01:11:40,923
I'm sorry my friends
ruined our wedding.

1629
01:11:41,006 --> 01:11:43,133
I never should've
questioned marrying you.

1630
01:11:43,217 --> 01:11:44,301
Look.

1631
01:11:44,385 --> 01:11:46,637
I have been through hell
trying to find you.

1632
01:11:47,304 --> 01:11:49,682
I mean, look at me.
I practically walked here.

1633
01:11:49,890 --> 01:11:52,893
Just, from now on,
nothing keeps
us apart, okay?

1634
01:11:52,977 --> 01:11:54,395
So, will you just...

1635
01:11:54,478 --> 01:11:56,063
Will you just take me back?

1636
01:11:56,146 --> 01:11:58,732
And we can just get married
and be happy, please?

1637
01:11:59,483 --> 01:12:00,693
I love you, Nardo.

1638
01:12:00,776 --> 01:12:02,277
You guys,
I just wanna say that...

1639
01:12:02,403 --> 01:12:04,989
I was wrong. You guys,
you do belong together.

1640
01:12:05,072 --> 01:12:06,907
You guys should
jail fuck right now

1641
01:12:06,991 --> 01:12:08,742
and make a baby that
has dual citizenship.

1642
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:13,163
I don't need
your permission.

1643
01:12:13,622 --> 01:12:14,790
Get over here.

1644
01:12:20,504 --> 01:12:21,839
Hey, I was wrong
about them.

1645
01:12:22,423 --> 01:12:23,841
Yeah, me, too.

1646
01:12:23,924 --> 01:12:25,092
I'm sorry.

1647
01:12:26,010 --> 01:12:27,136
It's okay.

1648
01:12:28,762 --> 01:12:30,597
- What was that sound?
- My truck!

1649
01:12:31,765 --> 01:12:32,891
Berk?

1650
01:12:33,225 --> 01:12:34,810
God!

1651
01:12:40,566 --> 01:12:41,966
They got my ear!
They nicked my ear!

1652
01:12:46,113 --> 01:12:47,489
- My God!
- Oh, my God!

1653
01:12:48,699 --> 01:12:49,908
Gunshots!
There's definitely guns!

1654
01:12:49,992 --> 01:12:50,993
I'm bleeding.

1655
01:12:51,076 --> 01:12:52,119
It's okay.
You're okay.

1656
01:12:54,288 --> 01:12:56,540
I'm gonna invite
myself to the party!

1657
01:12:57,291 --> 01:12:58,292
Ring-a-ling-a-ling!

1658
01:12:59,626 --> 01:13:00,836
Ring-a-ling-a-ling!

1659
01:13:01,712 --> 01:13:03,881
Pick the goddamn phone up!

1660
01:13:03,964 --> 01:13:05,591
Say something, Evan,
say something!

1661
01:13:05,674 --> 01:13:08,677
I don't know who you are,
but you can take the cocaine!

1662
01:13:08,761 --> 01:13:09,887
We don't want it.

1663
01:13:09,970 --> 01:13:12,097
No, that's not how it works.

1664
01:13:12,181 --> 01:13:14,183
You cross me,

1665
01:13:14,266 --> 01:13:17,853
I kill you. Understand?
That's how it works.

1666
01:13:18,479 --> 01:13:19,521
I'm gonna kill his ass.

1667
01:13:20,022 --> 01:13:21,106
I'm gonna let Grammy watch,

1668
01:13:21,190 --> 01:13:23,442
and I love Grammies,
believe me.

1669
01:13:23,525 --> 01:13:26,403
But in this case,
I'm gonna take my hand,

1670
01:13:26,487 --> 01:13:29,531
I'm gonna run my hand
up the crack of Grammy's ass,

1671
01:13:30,407 --> 01:13:31,408
you understand?

1672
01:13:31,492 --> 01:13:34,244
She's gonna stand next to me
while I squeeze her booty,

1673
01:13:34,328 --> 01:13:35,579
and she's gonna go...

1674
01:13:35,704 --> 01:13:37,039
Ooh!

1675
01:13:37,289 --> 01:13:38,874
'Cause that's
what Grammies do.

1676
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:41,168
Say something nice.

1677
01:13:41,251 --> 01:13:42,836
Make a friend.

1678
01:13:43,170 --> 01:13:44,755
You can have
our Smart car!

1679
01:13:44,838 --> 01:13:47,299
What the fuck I wanna
do with a Smart car? Huh?

1680
01:13:47,382 --> 01:13:50,594
I'll put that motherfucker
in drive and drive
it up your asshole,

1681
01:13:50,677 --> 01:13:52,930
and step out of it
and let it run
up your asshole!

1682
01:13:53,013 --> 01:13:56,016
And there's gonna be
smoke coming out your ass!

1683
01:13:56,517 --> 01:13:58,685
But then you'd
be in my asshole, too!

1684
01:13:58,977 --> 01:14:00,979
Shut the fuck up!
I already said it already!

1685
01:14:01,396 --> 01:14:02,940
That's my analogy!

1686
01:14:03,023 --> 01:14:05,526
I'll shoot that
goddamn Smart car dead!

1687
01:14:05,609 --> 01:14:07,152
Well, that's not
gonna work for us!

1688
01:14:07,236 --> 01:14:09,071
Nardo comes home with us!

1689
01:14:09,154 --> 01:14:10,989
Yeah, he's our friend!

1690
01:14:11,073 --> 01:14:12,574
He's your friend?

1691
01:14:12,658 --> 01:14:14,201
"He's my friend!"
Well, guess what?

1692
01:14:14,284 --> 01:14:16,203
I got friends,
too, motherfucker!

1693
01:14:27,548 --> 01:14:28,841
Okay, here's what
we're gonna do.

1694
01:14:28,924 --> 01:14:31,093
I am gonna go out
there and draw their
fire to distract them,

1695
01:14:31,176 --> 01:14:32,803
you guys are gonna
run to Tracy's car.

1696
01:14:32,928 --> 01:14:35,088
If anybody should do it,
it should be me.
What? Why you?

1697
01:14:35,097 --> 01:14:36,140
Because I'm a loser.

1698
01:14:36,223 --> 01:14:37,641
I mean, you're about
to get a promotion,

1699
01:14:37,724 --> 01:14:39,560
Nardo finally got Tracy,

1700
01:14:39,643 --> 01:14:41,854
he's gonna put
a little baby pig up
there in that city.

1701
01:14:41,937 --> 01:14:42,980
What?
Yeah.

1702
01:14:43,063 --> 01:14:45,065
All right, guys.
Let's go get them!

1703
01:14:45,149 --> 01:14:46,650
Just like
Thelma and Louise!

1704
01:14:46,733 --> 01:14:47,733
No, wait, they died!

1705
01:14:47,776 --> 01:14:49,069
They drove off
the Grand Canyon!

1706
01:14:56,577 --> 01:14:58,245
What the fuck?

1707
01:15:07,212 --> 01:15:08,338
Shit!

1708
01:15:08,922 --> 01:15:09,923
Beanbag.

1709
01:15:12,050 --> 01:15:13,051
Ooh.

1710
01:15:15,846 --> 01:15:17,764
Oh, shit.
Nardo!

1711
01:15:22,561 --> 01:15:23,854
Your whole sac is out!

1712
01:15:23,937 --> 01:15:25,189
Yeah, your balls are...

1713
01:15:25,272 --> 01:15:26,481
Well, they're
tiny underwear.

1714
01:15:26,565 --> 01:15:28,192
No, they're gonna
get shot off, man.

1715
01:15:33,322 --> 01:15:34,323
We should go.

1716
01:15:35,699 --> 01:15:37,159
Come on, honey!

1717
01:15:39,328 --> 01:15:40,621
Oh, shit!

1718
01:15:43,123 --> 01:15:44,249
Shit!

1719
01:15:45,375 --> 01:15:46,835
I'll drive,
I'll drive!

1720
01:15:53,508 --> 01:15:54,593
Oh, shit!

1721
01:15:55,135 --> 01:15:57,137
- Nardo! Get in!
- Get in!

1722
01:15:57,221 --> 01:15:58,347
Go, go, go, go!

1723
01:15:59,264 --> 01:16:00,265
Oh, shit!

1724
01:16:09,483 --> 01:16:10,567
Look at them!

1725
01:16:11,485 --> 01:16:13,195
Yeah! Fuck you!

1726
01:16:19,576 --> 01:16:20,953
You think you're
gonna make your meeting?

1727
01:16:21,036 --> 01:16:22,412
I think it'll be close.

1728
01:16:22,496 --> 01:16:27,042
You guys, I wanna
apologize for basically
everything I've done.

1729
01:16:27,125 --> 01:16:30,003
And, Tracy, I wanna
plan a new wedding, okay?
What do you say?

1730
01:16:30,087 --> 01:16:31,922
I think it's...
Uh, no, no, no.

1731
01:16:32,005 --> 01:16:33,507
When we get re-engaged,

1732
01:16:33,590 --> 01:16:36,593
it's gonna be without you
two assholes in the car.

1733
01:16:36,677 --> 01:16:37,719
Sorry.

1734
01:16:37,803 --> 01:16:39,054
Fair enough.

1735
01:16:39,972 --> 01:16:42,182
And you,
I need you to move out.

1736
01:16:42,516 --> 01:16:43,892
Excuse me?
ASAP.

1737
01:16:43,976 --> 01:16:45,269
What?
It means
"as soon as possible."

1738
01:16:45,352 --> 01:16:47,020
I know what ASAP means.

1739
01:16:47,354 --> 01:16:48,438
I finally get it.

1740
01:16:48,522 --> 01:16:50,440
It's time.
You need some space.

1741
01:16:50,524 --> 01:16:51,900
Look, we're best friends.

1742
01:16:51,984 --> 01:16:53,819
We will always
be best friends.

1743
01:16:53,902 --> 01:16:55,487
Nothing is gonna
change that.

1744
01:16:55,862 --> 01:16:57,906
I do think I am gonna
get my own place, though.

1745
01:16:59,825 --> 01:17:01,034
I just like it
when we're all together.

1746
01:17:01,118 --> 01:17:02,286
I know.

1747
01:17:03,996 --> 01:17:06,039
Uh, how am I gonna
get across the border?

1748
01:17:06,707 --> 01:17:09,501
I'm just not really good
with small spaces, so...

1749
01:17:40,574 --> 01:17:41,908
So, what do you
think you're gonna say?

1750
01:17:41,992 --> 01:17:44,202
Jason, you got me here,
that's all you
can do. Thanks.

1751
01:17:45,579 --> 01:17:47,372
Oh, she looks mad.
She looks really mad.

1752
01:17:47,456 --> 01:17:48,498
Motherfucker!

1753
01:17:58,467 --> 01:17:59,827
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

1754
01:18:00,719 --> 01:18:01,887
Did I read that wrong?

1755
01:18:01,970 --> 01:18:03,597
Yes.
Sorry.

1756
01:18:04,848 --> 01:18:05,932
I'm sorry about everything.

1757
01:18:06,016 --> 01:18:07,059
Okay, we'll talk
about it later.

1758
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:08,900
We have a meeting
to get to.
Screw the meeting.

1759
01:18:08,935 --> 01:18:10,979
I'm probably gonna get fired.

1760
01:18:11,063 --> 01:18:13,103
And I didn't
come here for that.
I came here for you.

1761
01:18:14,316 --> 01:18:16,651
I never asked you out
because we work together,

1762
01:18:16,735 --> 01:18:20,238
but I think part
of me was scared
and I'm done being scared.

1763
01:18:22,991 --> 01:18:24,076
Wow, really?

1764
01:18:24,451 --> 01:18:25,744
Read it wrong again.

1765
01:18:25,827 --> 01:18:26,995
Should've known.

1766
01:18:27,579 --> 01:18:29,122
We have a meeting. Come on.

1767
01:18:52,729 --> 01:18:53,730
I don't
know what got into you,

1768
01:18:53,814 --> 01:18:56,233
but the client loved
your presentation.

1769
01:18:56,900 --> 01:19:00,028
I'm giving you a promotion.
Congratulations.

1770
01:19:00,112 --> 01:19:01,154
Thank you, sir.

1771
01:19:01,238 --> 01:19:02,239
Oh!

1772
01:19:02,322 --> 01:19:04,616
Yeah, boy!
You're gonna crush it!

1773
01:19:04,699 --> 01:19:07,577
First you get the promotion,
then you move in with us!

1774
01:19:07,661 --> 01:19:08,787
Whoo! Spaghetti Tuesdays!

1775
01:19:08,870 --> 01:19:10,372
You're gonna move
in with us, right?

1776
01:19:11,289 --> 01:19:12,332
Get the fuck out of here.

1777
01:19:13,208 --> 01:19:14,334
Okay.

1778
01:19:26,805 --> 01:19:29,433
I gotta hand it you,
Nardo, you were right.

1779
01:19:29,516 --> 01:19:30,642
You do know
how to pick them.

1780
01:19:32,102 --> 01:19:34,187
So do you, you old dog.

1781
01:19:35,105 --> 01:19:37,023
Think she'll let
you kiss her tonight?

1782
01:19:37,107 --> 01:19:38,108
Oh. Come on.

1783
01:19:38,191 --> 01:19:40,318
But yeah,
hopefully she'll let
me kiss her tonight.

1784
01:19:40,735 --> 01:19:43,280
You ever think you'll
be able to learn how
to love Tracy?

1785
01:19:43,363 --> 01:19:46,283
No, Evan.
I think I'll be able
to learn how to love...

1786
01:19:46,366 --> 01:19:48,118
Wait, what did you say?
I said, learn how
to love Tracy.

1787
01:19:48,201 --> 01:19:49,870
Oh, yeah, I will.
I know I'll learn
how to love her, yeah.

1788
01:19:49,953 --> 01:19:50,996
Okay, guys.

1789
01:19:52,205 --> 01:19:53,248
Hi.

1790
01:19:53,707 --> 01:19:55,417
Congratulations.
Thank you.

1791
01:19:57,043 --> 01:19:58,044
Mmm.

1792
01:20:00,547 --> 01:20:02,174
You're family now.

1793
01:20:02,257 --> 01:20:04,050
Yeah. Don't forget it.

1794
01:20:09,222 --> 01:20:10,265
I love you.

1795
01:20:11,475 --> 01:20:13,935
Hey, I just remembered
where I know this guy from.

1796
01:20:14,019 --> 01:20:15,312
Great, Marty.
We'll talk about it later.

1797
01:20:15,395 --> 01:20:16,855
No, we got high
with him in my van.

1798
01:20:16,938 --> 01:20:18,356
He doesn't wanna
marry this chick.

1799
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:20,150
Okay. Marty,
that's okay.
Just sit down.

1800
01:20:20,233 --> 01:20:21,359
No, Marty, we already
took care of this.

1801
01:20:21,443 --> 01:20:22,652
You can't let this... No.
Marty, sit down.

1802
01:20:22,736 --> 01:20:23,987
We're not taking
those rings.
Marty, Marty...

1803
01:20:24,070 --> 01:20:25,822
You shouldn't
do this.
You're off base here, pal.

1804
01:20:25,906 --> 01:20:27,699
No. Hey, you don't
wanna do this, dude!
Okay.

1805
01:20:27,782 --> 01:20:28,950
Hey, remember the weed?
Marty! Marty.

1806
01:20:29,034 --> 01:20:31,620
I was just talking
it through.
That's all I was doing!

1807
01:20:32,078 --> 01:20:33,413
Sorry, Grammy.

1808
01:20:33,497 --> 01:20:35,040
You need weed right now...

1809
01:20:35,123 --> 01:20:36,833
Absolutely, you need weed!

1810
01:20:36,917 --> 01:20:39,211
<i>Today is the day
you say forever</i>

1811
01:20:39,294 --> 01:20:41,505
<i>From now on,
you stand together</i>

1812
01:20:41,588 --> 01:20:43,882
<i>Two hearts united
in wedded bliss</i>

1813
01:20:43,965 --> 01:20:47,928
<i>As you say your vows,
remember this</i>

1814
01:20:48,386 --> 01:20:51,348
<i>He's got the last penis
you're ever gonna see</i>

1815
01:20:51,431 --> 01:20:54,392
<i>The last penis
you'll feel inside your mouth</i>

1816
01:20:54,476 --> 01:20:56,353
<i>Hope he touches your clit,
not just your heart</i>

1817
01:20:56,436 --> 01:20:59,272
<i>'Cause he's the only one</i>
<i>who will till</i>
<i>death do you part</i>

1818
01:21:00,273 --> 01:21:02,859
<i>She's the last woman
you'll ever be inside of</i>

1819
01:21:02,943 --> 01:21:05,904
<i>The last mouth you'll have
wrapped around your dick</i>

1820
01:21:05,987 --> 01:21:07,781
<i>She'll find you</i>
<i>less attractive</i>
<i>as the years go by</i>

1821
01:21:07,864 --> 01:21:11,743
<i>But that's the only vagina</i>
<i>that will ever make</i>
<i>you come until you die</i>

1822
01:21:15,789 --> 01:21:18,542
<i>So, congrats to
the man and wife</i>

1823
01:21:18,625 --> 01:21:22,796
<i>For only fucking each other
for the rest of your life</i>

1824
01:22:22,439 --> 01:22:23,732
I gotta hand it
to you, Nardo, you did it.

1825
01:22:23,815 --> 01:22:24,816
Yeah.

1826
01:22:25,150 --> 01:22:26,985
Well, I mean,
this is the dream
right here.

1827
01:22:27,068 --> 01:22:28,778
You know, hanging out
with my two best friends

1828
01:22:28,862 --> 01:22:30,989
in a good
old-fashioned Narduzzi.

1829
01:22:31,072 --> 01:22:32,741
I couldn't have done
it without you guys.

1830
01:22:32,824 --> 01:22:34,784
Ah, cheers to that, man.
Cheers.

1831
01:22:34,868 --> 01:22:36,745
It'd be cool if there
were girls in the tub.

1832
01:22:36,828 --> 01:22:38,121
It is what it is.

1833
01:22:38,204 --> 01:22:39,664
- Daniel!
- Grammy?

1834
01:22:39,748 --> 01:22:41,082
What are you doing here?

1835
01:22:41,166 --> 01:22:43,543
A man sent me here
to watch something.

1836
01:22:43,877 --> 01:22:45,045
- Watch something?
- What?

1837
01:22:47,213 --> 01:22:48,214
What is that?

1838
01:22:49,090 --> 01:22:50,383
Go, go, go!

1839
01:31:48,754 --> 01:31:50,006
What happened?

1840
01:31:50,089 --> 01:31:52,091
Nothing. You passed out.

1841
01:31:56,137 --> 01:31:57,388
Are we having sex?

1842
01:31:57,930 --> 01:31:59,182
No.

1843
01:31:59,265 --> 01:32:00,766
I'm prepping you.
What?

1844
01:32:00,850 --> 01:32:02,059
We could have sex, though.

1845
01:32:02,143 --> 01:32:04,228
I mean, if you want to.

1846
01:32:05,104 --> 01:32:06,522
Got time.

1847
01:32:08,441 --> 01:32:09,525
Okay. Yeah, okay.

1848
01:32:09,609 --> 01:32:12,862
Yeah? You should know
you are completely paralyzed.

1849
01:32:16,282 --> 01:32:17,408
Oh, my God.

1850
01:32:17,491 --> 01:32:20,286
So that means your dick
is not gonna work.

1851
01:32:20,870 --> 01:32:23,873
My dick works great, though.

1852
01:32:25,875 --> 01:32:27,168
Okay.
You know what?

1853
01:32:27,251 --> 01:32:28,920
I always wanted to find out

1854
01:32:29,003 --> 01:32:30,379
what this did.

1855
01:32:30,713 --> 01:32:31,964
What?

1856
01:32:32,089 --> 01:32:34,342
JK, man, JK. I'm not.

1857
01:32:34,425 --> 01:32:35,551
What's "JK" stand for?

1858
01:32:35,635 --> 01:32:36,719
"Just kidding."

1859
01:32:36,802 --> 01:32:37,845
I text a lot.

1860
01:32:37,929 --> 01:32:40,089
I thought it stood for,
like, "jolly cock"
or something.

1861
01:32:40,097 --> 01:32:41,724
No.
I don't know.

1862
01:32:41,807 --> 01:32:43,059
"Jolly cock,"
though, would be pretty...

1863
01:32:43,142 --> 01:32:44,393
Sex talk.

1864
01:32:47,897 --> 01:32:48,898
Hey.

1865
01:32:48,981 --> 01:32:52,068
