Everyone inside now!

3
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:44,536
Lucinda, we're going in.

4
00:01:46,446 --> 00:01:47,777
Lucinda!

5
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:51,913
Lucinda, we're going in.

6
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:54,547
Lucinda!

7
00:01:59,558 --> 00:02:03,688
Now, you remember tomorrow
is our official opening day, don't you?

8
00:02:03,762 --> 00:02:06,026
- Yes, Miss Taylor.
- Yes, Miss Taylor.

9
00:02:06,097 --> 00:02:09,429
And you remember Principal Clark
ran a competition last month

10
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:14,130
to find the best ideas to celebrate
this very special day.

11
00:02:14,205 --> 00:02:16,696
- Me! Me! Me!
- Me! Me! Me!

12
00:02:16,774 --> 00:02:20,869
Well, yesterday,
the staff selected the winning idea,

13
00:02:20,944 --> 00:02:24,175
and it came from this class.

14
00:02:25,982 --> 00:02:29,644
The winner is our own

15
00:02:30,686 --> 00:02:32,381
Lucinda Embry.

16
00:02:32,454 --> 00:02:34,285
Lucinda?
Why her?

17
00:02:34,356 --> 00:02:35,823
Lucinda?
Lucinda?

18
00:02:35,891 --> 00:02:37,619
Come on, everyone.

19
00:02:40,595 --> 00:02:45,828
We'll be closing our dedication ceremony
with the burial of a time capsule.

20
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,998
- Yes?
- What's a time capsule?

21
00:02:57,576 --> 00:03:00,067
This is a time capsule.

22
00:03:00,145 --> 00:03:02,579
Wow.
That's incredible.

23
00:03:02,648 --> 00:03:05,617
Now, I need you
to put your thinking caps on,

24
00:03:05,684 --> 00:03:08,151
because I want each of you to draw

25
00:03:08,219 --> 00:03:11,677
what you think the future
is going to look like.

26
00:03:11,756 --> 00:03:15,556
Then we'll put the pictures in the capsule,
and 50 years from today,

27
00:03:15,626 --> 00:03:21,121
a group of children just like yourselves
will open it up to see what you drew.

28
00:03:22,299 --> 00:03:23,766
Doesn't that sound exciting?

29
00:03:23,834 --> 00:03:26,028
- Yes, Miss Taylor.
- Yes, Miss Taylor.

30
00:03:26,102 --> 00:03:27,626
Let's begin.

31
00:03:31,474 --> 00:03:33,601
That is a lovely spaceship there, Dawn.

32
00:03:33,676 --> 00:03:36,007
Thank you, Miss Taylor.
Well done.

33
00:03:36,077 --> 00:03:39,137
And that is a nice robot, Andrew.
Very good.

34
00:03:40,515 --> 00:03:43,416
Time's up. Everyone hand your work in.

35
00:03:43,485 --> 00:03:46,419
And make sure you write your name
on the envelope.

36
00:03:46,487 --> 00:03:47,511
My name's over here.

37
00:03:47,588 --> 00:03:49,556
Thank you, Harold.
Thank you, Miss Taylor.

38
00:03:49,623 --> 00:03:51,614
Lucinda, you need to finish up now.

39
00:03:51,692 --> 00:03:53,683
- Thank you.
Thank you.

40
00:03:56,763 --> 00:03:58,094
Oh, Lucinda.

41
00:03:59,098 --> 00:04:01,862
The assignment was to draw a picture.

42
00:04:03,902 --> 00:04:05,699
This was your idea.

43
00:04:14,645 --> 00:04:17,978
Okay, I want you all to finish, please.

44
00:04:22,186 --> 00:04:26,246
<i>Welcome to all
our friends and esteemed colleagues.</i>

45
00:04:26,323 --> 00:04:31,488
<i>We, the students and faculty
of William Dawes Elementary,</i>

46
00:04:31,561 --> 00:04:36,361
<i>hereby bury this time capsule
in dedication of our new school,</i>

47
00:04:37,299 --> 00:04:39,267
<i>and we charge our descendents</i>

48
00:04:39,335 --> 00:04:43,964
<i>to open this vault of history
50 years from today.</i>

49
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:49,003
<i>To the future and the promise that it holds.</i>

50
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:36,179
Lucinda?

51
00:05:37,053 --> 00:05:38,350
Lucinda?

52
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:40,585
Lucinda?

53
00:05:40,655 --> 00:05:44,182
I'm certain Lucinda
is simply being over curious.

54
00:05:45,494 --> 00:05:48,122
Can you please help find her?

55
00:05:48,196 --> 00:05:50,595
The cloakroom. Check the cloakroom.

56
00:05:50,664 --> 00:05:52,859
Lucinda. Henry, come on.

57
00:05:53,734 --> 00:05:56,294
- Lucinda?
Come on out now.

58
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:59,504
Lucinda?

59
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:20,455
Lucinda.

60
00:06:23,461 --> 00:06:25,190
Oh, my God.

61
00:06:29,065 --> 00:06:33,297
Make them stop.
Please make them stop whispering.

62
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:45,910
Caleb? Take a look at this.

63
00:08:46,556 --> 00:08:48,046
There you go.

64
00:08:51,493 --> 00:08:52,585
What is it?

65
00:08:52,661 --> 00:08:55,323
Saturn's rings await your approval.

66
00:08:57,432 --> 00:08:59,798
Has anyone found life on other planets?

67
00:08:59,868 --> 00:09:03,200
Not yet. Guess it's just us for now.

68
00:09:05,906 --> 00:09:09,103
Okay.
Then how many that might have life?

69
00:09:09,176 --> 00:09:14,545
Well, if you count the number of stars
similar to our sun in this galaxy,

70
00:09:14,614 --> 00:09:18,641
then you factor in the probability that
they have Earth-like planets orbiting them...

71
00:09:18,718 --> 00:09:20,651
There are 10 million possible worlds

72
00:09:20,719 --> 00:09:24,155
with four million mature enough
for life to evolve.

73
00:09:25,891 --> 00:09:27,552
Why do you even ask?

74
00:09:27,626 --> 00:09:30,355
Just making sure if you're listening.

75
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:34,024
- Where you going?
- To watch that Discovery program.

76
00:09:34,098 --> 00:09:37,625
But it's Dad's famous Sunday night
hot dogs on the run...

77
00:09:38,603 --> 00:09:39,591
...time.

78
00:09:39,669 --> 00:09:43,332
I can't consume that.
I've decided to become a vegetarian.

79
00:09:43,406 --> 00:09:45,135
Well, when were you planning on
telling the guy

80
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:47,472
who buys the groceries around here?

81
00:09:47,544 --> 00:09:50,671
Are you deaf? I just told you now, Dad.

82
00:09:53,983 --> 00:09:57,885
<i>The cubs are now
six months old and bounding with energy,</i>

83
00:09:57,953 --> 00:10:02,355
<i>but, any parent knows,
this is also a mixed blessing.</i>

84
00:10:03,658 --> 00:10:07,094
- Off.
- No, it's almost over.

85
00:10:07,161 --> 00:10:10,857
You're not gonna be able to concentrate
in class tomorrow.

86
00:10:11,264 --> 00:10:15,428
I don't have class tomorrow.
It's the 50th anniversary, remember?

87
00:10:16,603 --> 00:10:18,035
I remember.

88
00:10:23,242 --> 00:10:24,504
Caleb,

89
00:10:28,146 --> 00:10:31,274
when I said it was just us out there,

90
00:10:31,349 --> 00:10:34,614
you know I was talking about space, right?

91
00:10:34,686 --> 00:10:37,916
I didn't mean heaven, or anything.

92
00:10:37,988 --> 00:10:42,516
- I'm sure wherever Mom is...
- Dad, you don't even believe in heaven.

93
00:10:45,295 --> 00:10:47,785
I never said that, Caleb.

94
00:10:47,864 --> 00:10:51,891
I just said we can't know for sure, that's all.

95
00:10:52,869 --> 00:10:56,861
If you want to believe,
you go ahead and believe, okay?

96
00:10:58,874 --> 00:11:00,432
Okay. Bedtime.

97
00:11:08,949 --> 00:11:12,976
Hey, you and me,

98
00:11:13,054 --> 00:11:15,886
- together forever.
- Forever.

99
00:11:19,025 --> 00:11:20,492
I love you.

100
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,289
I love you, too.

101
00:12:29,555 --> 00:12:30,715
We're going to pose a topic

102
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:33,758
to get you thinking along the right lines
for your term paper.

103
00:12:33,825 --> 00:12:38,785
It's the subject of randomness
versus determinism in the universe.

104
00:12:38,864 --> 00:12:40,889
Who's jumping in? Jessica?

105
00:12:40,966 --> 00:12:43,832
Determinism says
that occurrences in nature

106
00:12:43,901 --> 00:12:47,894
are causally decided by preceding events
or natural laws,

107
00:12:47,972 --> 00:12:51,338
that everything leading up to this point
has happened for a reason.

108
00:12:51,407 --> 00:12:54,433
That's right. That's what determinism says.

109
00:12:58,915 --> 00:13:02,611
Spencer? Tell me something about the sun.

110
00:13:02,684 --> 00:13:03,673
It's hot.

111
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,048
Elaborate.

112
00:13:06,121 --> 00:13:08,851
Temperature's about 10,000 degrees
Fahrenheit on the surface,

113
00:13:08,924 --> 00:13:11,687
- 27 million degrees at the core.
- Good.

114
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,091
Stacey?

115
00:13:17,165 --> 00:13:19,758
A word or two about the composition.

116
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,300
Mostly hydrogen.

117
00:13:21,368 --> 00:13:24,496
Also helium with some carbon
and nitrogen thrown in there.

118
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:29,803
Excellent. Now, I want you to think
about the perfect set of circumstances

119
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,935
that put this celestial ball of fire

120
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:38,714
at just the correct distance

121
00:13:41,619 --> 00:13:45,521
from our little blue planet for life to evolve,

122
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:48,888
making it possible for you
to be sitting here in this riveting lecture.

123
00:13:50,194 --> 00:13:52,025
But that's a nice thought, right?

124
00:13:52,095 --> 00:13:57,055
Everything has a purpose, an order to it,
is determined.

125
00:13:58,968 --> 00:14:02,131
But then there's the other side
of the argument,

126
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:09,773
the theory of randomness,
which says it's all simply coincidence.

127
00:14:11,079 --> 00:14:16,107
The very fact we exist is nothing
but the result of a complex

128
00:14:16,184 --> 00:14:19,710
yet inevitable string of chemical accidents

129
00:14:20,955 --> 00:14:23,048
and biological mutations.

130
00:14:24,225 --> 00:14:26,420
There is no grand meaning.

131
00:14:29,562 --> 00:14:31,393
There's no purpose.

132
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:47,800
What about you,
Professor Koestler?

133
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:51,281
- What?
- Well, what do you believe?

134
00:14:54,585 --> 00:14:57,314
I think shit just happens.

135
00:14:59,689 --> 00:15:02,749
But that's me. Class dismissed.

136
00:15:06,395 --> 00:15:10,354
Now, that's some very heavy shit
for a Monday morning, by the sounds of it.

137
00:15:10,432 --> 00:15:14,232
Since when does the cosmology
department audit my lectures?

138
00:15:14,303 --> 00:15:18,136
Since my esteemed colleague
in astrophysics owes me a latte.

139
00:15:21,042 --> 00:15:24,238
So what's on
your scientific mind today?

140
00:15:24,311 --> 00:15:28,771
Do you remember Kim's little sister?
Ph-double D's? Remember her?

141
00:15:28,849 --> 00:15:31,545
Is it ethical to say things like that
about your sister-in-law?

142
00:15:31,618 --> 00:15:35,815
What? It's factual. It's peer-reviewed.
I mean, it's like... Anyway, whatever.

143
00:15:35,888 --> 00:15:37,685
- She's in town this Friday.
- Okay.

144
00:15:37,757 --> 00:15:40,749
And she thinks that you're intriguing,
which I thought was code for gay,

145
00:15:40,826 --> 00:15:45,387
but apparently not because she's asked
if you would join us for dinner.

146
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:50,493
- Yeah, I... I don't know, Phil.
- Come on, John.

147
00:15:50,568 --> 00:15:53,900
Come on, you owe me for last time
you skipped out on me.

148
00:15:53,971 --> 00:15:56,132
- Caleb was panicking.
- Yeah, look, I know.

149
00:15:56,206 --> 00:15:58,299
And the time before that,
he had a sore throat.

150
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,138
- Oh, no.
- What?

151
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:02,507
- Damn it! Damn it!
- What?

152
00:16:02,578 --> 00:16:05,342
Caleb's ceremony. I'm sorry, Phil.

153
00:16:05,415 --> 00:16:07,440
Hey! Hey! Friday!

154
00:16:07,517 --> 00:16:09,348
I'll think about it!

155
00:16:11,354 --> 00:16:13,583
<i>- This little light of mine
- This little light of mine</i>

156
00:16:13,655 --> 00:16:16,249
<i>- I'm gonna let it shine
- I'm gonna let it shine</i>

157
00:16:16,325 --> 00:16:18,759
<i>- This little light of mine
- This little light of mine</i>

158
00:16:18,827 --> 00:16:21,352
<i>- I'm gonna let it shine

159
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:23,829
<i>- This little light of mine

160
00:16:23,898 --> 00:16:25,729
<i>- I'm gonna let it shine
- I'm gonna let it shine</i>

161
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:30,863
<i>- Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine
- Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine</i>

162
00:16:36,242 --> 00:16:41,543
<i>Fifty years ago, the students and faculty
of William Dawes Elementary</i>

163
00:16:41,613 --> 00:16:44,878
<i>imagined what the future might hold.</i>

164
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:48,181
<i>Today, we unveil their legacy.</i>

165
00:16:48,253 --> 00:16:51,619
<i>Now, I'd like to introduce you
to someone very special,</i>

166
00:16:51,689 --> 00:16:53,680
<i>Miss Priscilla Taylor.</i>

167
00:16:56,427 --> 00:16:59,157
<i>Since Miss Taylor was there
for the original dedication,</i>

168
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:03,029
<i>it's only fitting that we have her
do the honors today.</i>

169
00:17:23,385 --> 00:17:24,784
Wow!

170
00:17:33,994 --> 00:17:36,121
You almost forgot again.

171
00:17:36,196 --> 00:17:40,859
I made it in time to hear you sing.
You were the best one up there.

172
00:17:40,933 --> 00:17:44,835
- You could not hear me.
- I could. I swear.

173
00:17:47,774 --> 00:17:50,173
Gotta go. They're starting!

174
00:17:50,242 --> 00:17:52,107
All right, easy, easy!
No pushing.

175
00:17:52,177 --> 00:17:55,078
Everyone is going to receive an envelope.

176
00:17:59,016 --> 00:18:02,782
Open them gently now. They're very old.

177
00:18:05,456 --> 00:18:07,582
Miss Taylor! Miss Taylor!

178
00:18:10,093 --> 00:18:11,492
Thank you.

179
00:18:13,263 --> 00:18:14,628
Everyone's gonna get one.

180
00:18:28,943 --> 00:18:31,138
- Hello again, John.
- Hello. How's it going?

181
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:03,197
Hey, what'd you get?

182
00:19:03,274 --> 00:19:06,538
Boring.
Everyone else got a picture.

183
00:19:25,627 --> 00:19:28,095
Caleb, could you please watch
where you put this?

184
00:19:28,163 --> 00:19:31,428
I don't want you to lose another one.

185
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,729
It's making funny noises.

186
00:19:33,801 --> 00:19:36,099
Try turning the volume down.

187
00:19:39,607 --> 00:19:43,064
Hey, Dad? You know that kid, Jason,
from soccer practice?

188
00:19:43,143 --> 00:19:44,167
Mmm-hmm.

189
00:19:44,244 --> 00:19:48,374
He's having a sleepover this weekend,
and he was wondering if I can come.

190
00:19:48,448 --> 00:19:50,109
Sounds like fun.

191
00:19:50,183 --> 00:19:51,673
They have a boat.

192
00:19:51,751 --> 00:19:55,242
Jason's dad said he might take us out
on the lake.

193
00:19:56,421 --> 00:19:58,048
I'll think about it.

194
00:19:58,123 --> 00:20:01,490
- That means no.
- It means I'll think about it.

195
00:20:07,031 --> 00:20:09,966
What are you doing with this?

196
00:20:10,034 --> 00:20:12,695
You weren't supposed to bring this home.
It belongs to the school.

197
00:20:12,769 --> 00:20:17,570
But maybe it means something,
like a math puzzle or something like that.

198
00:20:17,641 --> 00:20:21,201
Yeah, that's good, I don't know,
but it's not ours to keep.

199
00:20:21,277 --> 00:20:25,008
Now, you return this as soon
as you get to school tomorrow. Got it?

200
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,241
Okay, let's go. Bedtime.

201
00:20:41,862 --> 00:20:47,357
<i>O'er thy spirit gently stealing</i>

00:20:57,076 --> 00:21:01,910

00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:07,647
<i>Goodnight, baby.</i>

00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:10,246
Goodnight, Mom.

9l11l01.

213
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:42,021
Two thousand, nine hundred
and ninety-six.

214
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,259
Come on.

215
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,530
What the hell is this?

216
00:25:20,011 --> 00:25:22,639
<i>In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina...</i>

217

<i>There could be

218
00:25:37,927 --> 00:25:39,519
Oh, my God.

219
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:45,992
Dad?

220
00:25:48,837 --> 00:25:50,964
Dad, we're gonna be late!

221
00:25:57,778 --> 00:26:00,212
Do you have your knapsack all set?

222
00:26:02,916 --> 00:26:05,476
Thanks for the ride, Mr. Koestler.

223
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:08,780
Dad, are you sick?

224
00:26:09,655 --> 00:26:11,020
I'm fine.

225
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:14,116
Don't you think you're acting
kind of awkward today?

226
00:26:14,193 --> 00:26:18,458
Am I awkward?
I just had a lot of work to do last night.

227
00:26:19,764 --> 00:26:20,958
Okay.

228
00:26:21,867 --> 00:26:23,994
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye.

229
00:26:31,442 --> 00:26:32,466
Look at this.

230
00:26:32,543 --> 00:26:34,477
- Look at the numbers beside the date.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

231
00:26:34,545 --> 00:26:35,977
Two thousand, nine hundred
and ninety-six.

232
00:26:36,045 --> 00:26:37,069
Right.

233
00:26:37,146 --> 00:26:38,704
That's how many people died
in the attacks that day.

234
00:26:38,781 --> 00:26:39,873
- Yeah.
- All right, stay with me.

235
00:26:39,949 --> 00:26:43,112
I know how this sounds, but I've matched
these numbers to the dates

236
00:26:43,186 --> 00:26:47,986
of every major global disaster
for the last 50 years in perfect sequence,

237
00:26:48,056 --> 00:26:49,318
except for three.

238
00:26:49,391 --> 00:26:52,588
And these events haven't occurred yet,
starting with this one.

239
00:26:52,661 --> 00:26:55,823
So tomorrow, somewhere on the planet,
this number string predicts

240
00:26:55,897 --> 00:27:00,834
that 81 people are gonna die
in some kind of tragedy.

241
00:27:00,902 --> 00:27:04,837
- Whoa. I mean, have a listen to yourself.
- I know.

242
00:27:04,905 --> 00:27:06,372
- It sounds pretty crazy.
- I know.

243
00:27:06,439 --> 00:27:08,498
I mean, even for you.

244
00:27:15,881 --> 00:27:18,008
- What's this?
- Open it.

245
00:27:20,486 --> 00:27:21,646
Oh!

246
00:27:22,887 --> 00:27:24,684
Why are you showing me this?

247
00:27:24,756 --> 00:27:29,090
The day Allison died in the fire,
it's on the list, too,

248
00:27:29,827 --> 00:27:34,354
from a piece of paper that's been
buried in the ground for five decades.

249
00:27:35,098 --> 00:27:37,589
- Yeah.
- Can you explain that, Phil?

250
00:27:38,569 --> 00:27:41,697
I was up all night going over this.
I went through that list again and again,

251
00:27:41,772 --> 00:27:44,672
and I tried to fault it and I couldn't.

252
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:47,038
Maybe someone's playing
a really shitty joke...

253
00:27:47,109 --> 00:27:51,068
Right! Right! Except I saw them dig it up!

254
00:27:53,114 --> 00:27:55,173
I watched them pull the capsule
out of the ground

255
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:57,275
and hand that sealed envelope to my kid.

256
00:27:57,352 --> 00:27:59,650
Okay, let me ask you this, then.

257
00:27:59,721 --> 00:28:02,052
All these uncircled numbers,
what do they mean?

258
00:28:02,122 --> 00:28:04,249
I don't know yet. Maybe nothing.
But the circled...

259
00:28:04,325 --> 00:28:06,725
Maybe they all mean nothing.

260
00:28:06,794 --> 00:28:09,627
Okay, Phil, hey,
can we just start over here?

261
00:28:09,697 --> 00:28:13,530
I'm not saying that 81 people
are going to die tomorrow, okay?

262
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,160
I'm just trying to understand
why this is saying they will.

263
00:28:16,235 --> 00:28:18,897
Okay, it's spooky, all right? I'll grant you.
It's more than spooky.

264
00:28:18,972 --> 00:28:20,495
But just step back, all right?

265
00:28:20,572 --> 00:28:23,700
You have all these uncircled numbers
with no sequence to them.

266
00:28:23,775 --> 00:28:26,903
I mean, numerology,
kabala, Pythagorean cults,

267
00:28:26,979 --> 00:28:29,675
there are systems
that find meaning in numbers,

268
00:28:29,748 --> 00:28:32,147
and they are a dime a dozen. Why?

269
00:28:32,216 --> 00:28:35,617
Because people see
what they want to see in them.

270
00:28:38,122 --> 00:28:40,248
I mean,
that's really what you think I'm doing?

271
00:28:40,323 --> 00:28:43,554
Yeah, I think that losing Allison
has spun you off your axis a little,

272
00:28:43,627 --> 00:28:46,425
and I think it's clouded your judgment.

273
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:53,529
I'm just saying it's clouded your judgment.

274
00:28:53,602 --> 00:28:55,365
Don't you think?

275
00:28:57,239 --> 00:28:59,832
- Where are you going?
- Off campus.

276
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:23,592
Yes?

277
00:29:25,531 --> 00:29:27,465
But you do remember her?

278
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:31,468
Oh, yes. I remember Lucinda.

279
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:36,705
She was such a sad little girl.

280
00:29:44,014 --> 00:29:46,482
Would you like some iced tea?

281
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:49,450
Oh, no. Thank you. Thank you.

282
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:55,353
Do you remember the day your students
buried the time capsule?

283
00:29:55,425 --> 00:29:58,689
Oh, yes.
The children were so excited.

284
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,728
And what about Lucinda?

285
00:30:01,997 --> 00:30:05,091
That was the day we couldn't find her.

286
00:30:05,167 --> 00:30:08,431
She was hiding in a closet, under the gym,

287
00:30:08,502 --> 00:30:13,269
scratching at the door with her fingernails
like some kind of animal.

288
00:30:13,774 --> 00:30:15,764
Scratching at the door?

289
00:30:16,976 --> 00:30:20,605
- Why was she hiding?
- I'm not sure.

290
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:23,945
She was holding up the class
writing all those silly numbers.

291
00:30:24,017 --> 00:30:26,314
I had to hurry her along.

292
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:29,487
Then we found her,

293
00:30:29,555 --> 00:30:33,116
and I knew something had frightened
the poor dear,

294
00:30:33,192 --> 00:30:36,820
but we never could get her
to tell us what it was.

295
00:30:36,894 --> 00:30:42,196
Miss Taylor, my son got
Lucinda's time capsule message.

296
00:30:44,835 --> 00:30:48,293
Do you remember this?
Is this what she wrote?

297
00:30:48,371 --> 00:30:53,138
Oh, Professor, you are testing
an old woman's memory.

298
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:56,770
- Can you believe it's been 50 years?
- It's a long time.

299
00:31:04,219 --> 00:31:06,210
I believe that's it.

300
00:31:07,622 --> 00:31:09,180
How rude of me.

301
00:31:10,358 --> 00:31:15,454
I never offered you a drink.
Would you like some iced tea?

302
00:31:15,529 --> 00:31:17,793
No, thank you. I'm fine.

303
00:31:17,865 --> 00:31:20,060
I thought maybe I could meet her.

304
00:31:20,134 --> 00:31:25,161
Oh! I'm sorry.
Lucinda passed away several years ago.

305
00:31:29,008 --> 00:31:31,704
I said I'm Caleb Koestler's father.

306
00:31:31,778 --> 00:31:34,712
I'm calling to find out
the names of the two janitors

307
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:39,217
that pulled the time capsule out
of the ground yesterday at the ceremony.

308
00:32:01,303 --> 00:32:04,136
I'm not sure I understand
why that would be a problem for you.

309
00:32:06,408 --> 00:32:10,071
<i>Yes, sir, we're afraid that
that's privileged information.</i>

310
00:32:22,722 --> 00:32:23,984
Caleb!

311
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:30,690
- Who was that?
- I don't know. Just some guys.

312
00:32:31,597 --> 00:32:32,928
What did he give you?

313
00:32:32,998 --> 00:32:35,489
Just this. Kind of cool, isn't it?

314
00:32:40,772 --> 00:32:43,639
What did I say about talking to strangers?

315
00:32:44,375 --> 00:32:45,603
Have you done your homework?

316
00:32:45,677 --> 00:32:47,076
Give me 10 more minutes of practice.

317
00:32:47,145 --> 00:32:50,671
I don't want to have to ask you twice,
Caleb. Come on.

318
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:09,519
Hey!

319
00:33:12,367 --> 00:33:13,561
Hey, stranger.

320
00:33:13,635 --> 00:33:16,331
At what age do we learn to knock?

321
00:33:16,404 --> 00:33:19,895
I said I was going to drop by on my way
to the graveyard shift, remember?

322
00:33:19,974 --> 00:33:22,204
- Didn't you get my message?
- I've been busy.

323
00:33:22,276 --> 00:33:25,006
Can you not play with my things?

324
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:28,411
- You're always busy.
- Yes! Yes.

325
00:33:31,784 --> 00:33:34,776
How's my nephew?
Decided to become a vegetarian.

326
00:33:34,854 --> 00:33:37,515
A what?
- Why, you got a problem with that?

327
00:33:37,589 --> 00:33:42,117
You're not feeding him Dad's famous
Sunday night hot dogs again, are you?

328
00:33:43,061 --> 00:33:45,859
You know, if you want someone to take him
off your hands for the evening

329
00:33:45,931 --> 00:33:48,364
so you can go out, you know,
like normal people do...

330
00:33:48,432 --> 00:33:50,627
I appreciate the offer, but we're fine.

331
00:33:50,701 --> 00:33:53,636
And, believe it or not, Caleb and I have got
a good thing going here.

332
00:33:53,704 --> 00:33:54,693
Uh-huh?

333
00:33:54,772 --> 00:33:58,298
Yeah. So you can report
that back to headquarters.

334
00:33:58,541 --> 00:34:01,032
Mom says hi. So does Dad.

335
00:34:01,845 --> 00:34:04,973
Grace, don't.

336
00:34:07,349 --> 00:34:09,510
I get that you don't like
being the son of a pastor.

337
00:34:09,585 --> 00:34:11,678
I am the son of a pastor.

338
00:34:11,754 --> 00:34:13,346
That's fine.

339
00:34:13,422 --> 00:34:17,687
- You're still his son. Can't you let it go?
- Can't he?

340
00:34:17,759 --> 00:34:20,387
You know he asks after you
every time I see him.

341
00:34:20,461 --> 00:34:22,861
- He worries about you.
- He said that?

342
00:34:22,931 --> 00:34:25,125
- He doesn't have to.
- Right.

343
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:30,001
You're going to have to speak to him
one day, you know.

344
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:31,935
This can't go on forever.

345
00:34:32,005 --> 00:34:34,199
You know it's what Allison wanted,

346
00:34:34,273 --> 00:34:37,606
for Caleb to have a grandfather,
and vice versa.

347
00:34:40,813 --> 00:34:43,281
Okay, I'm going. I'm going.

348
00:34:44,349 --> 00:34:47,409
By the way, Grace, how are you?
How's your life? What's going on for you?

349
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:50,682
- Thank you, John, for asking.
- I have to get up early in the morning.

350
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,723
What have you got going on?
I'll say a prayer.

351
00:34:52,791 --> 00:34:54,155
Please...

352
00:34:55,592 --> 00:34:57,150
Don't.

353
00:34:57,227 --> 00:34:58,489

I can ask questions when you tell me
things to do that don't make sense.

442
00:42:58,959 --> 00:43:02,485
You won't let me play soccer,
you won't let me stay over at Jason's,

443
00:43:02,561 --> 00:43:04,495
and now you won't tell me what's going on

Oh, my God. John, you... You were there?

447

The date, the number of dead,
the GPS coordinates, lat and long.

448
00:44:04,584 --> 00:44:08,179
- Why didn't I see that?
- It wasn't coincidence.

It's not coincidence.

451
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:15,550
Okay, John, I didn't say it was.

452
00:44:18,096 --> 00:44:20,962
So what are we calling this?
Synchronicity?

453
00:44:21,032 --> 00:44:25,765
Two unrelated events,
digging up a time capsule, plane crash,

454
00:44:25,837 --> 00:44:29,636
combined to create a significance
for the subject, you?

455
00:44:29,706 --> 00:44:32,106
I keep seeing their faces,

456

00:44:38,113 --> 00:44:39,444
Oh, man.

458
00:44:41,884 --> 00:44:45,786
Okay, look.
We're way beyond the bounds here, John.

459
00:44:45,855 --> 00:44:47,345
We don't have a frame of reference.

460
00:44:47,423 --> 00:44:50,880
There could be multiple meanings
to consider.

461
00:44:50,959 --> 00:44:53,223
There are two disasters left.

462
00:44:54,062 --> 00:44:55,552
What are you saying?

463
00:44:55,630 --> 00:45:01,795
The numbers are warnings meant for me.

464
00:45:02,336 --> 00:45:05,533
They might just as easily
be a warning to stay away.

465
00:45:05,606 --> 00:45:08,267
You could have been killed today, John.
Caleb would have been orphaned,

466
00:45:08,341 --> 00:45:10,935
and you want to go put yourself
back in harm's way?

467
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:12,841
Two disasters left.

468
00:45:20,986 --> 00:45:25,923
Right now my scientific mind is telling me
to have nothing more to do with this,

469
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:28,692
and yours should, too.

470
00:48:01,462 --> 00:48:03,828
Dad!

471
00:48:14,107 --> 00:48:16,439
Caleb, what's wrong? What's wrong?

472
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:17,977
Dad!

473
00:48:18,045 --> 00:48:20,604
It's okay. It's okay.

474
00:48:22,782 --> 00:48:24,773
It's just a bad dream.

475
00:48:27,353 --> 00:48:29,252
It's just a bad dream.

476
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:43,994
Hey!

477
00:48:51,607 --> 00:48:52,767
Hey!

478
00:48:54,110 --> 00:48:56,544
You stay away from us, you hear?

479
00:48:57,379 --> 00:48:59,108
Want some of this?

480
00:49:17,030 --> 00:49:19,692
One, two, three...

481
00:49:35,246 --> 00:49:37,942
- Got your hat, honey?
- Yeah.

482
00:50:14,515 --> 00:50:17,484
Caleb, why don't you check out
the dire wolf?

483
00:50:17,551 --> 00:50:20,179
- I'll catch up with you, okay?
- Okay.

484
00:50:34,166 --> 00:50:36,657
Do you know that all wolves are born deaf?

485
00:50:36,735 --> 00:50:38,362
Really?

486
00:50:38,436 --> 00:50:39,869
But, you know, when they get older,

487
00:50:39,938 --> 00:50:42,497
they can hear another wolf's howl
from 10 miles away.

488
00:50:42,573 --> 00:50:44,768
Wow. How did you know that?

489
00:50:44,842 --> 00:50:47,470
<i>I read it in a National Geographic.</i>

490
00:50:47,545 --> 00:50:50,537
<i>Mammal responses to rising
temperatures and other climate changes...</i>

491
00:50:50,614 --> 00:50:51,706
Hi.

492
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:53,641
Hi.

493
00:50:53,716 --> 00:50:55,707
Is that your daughter?

494
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:01,022
- Yeah, why?
- Why? That's my son,

495
00:51:01,090 --> 00:51:04,616
and they look like
they're already best friends.

496
00:51:04,693 --> 00:51:07,662
Yeah, Abby's probably telling him
about the animals.

497
00:51:07,729 --> 00:51:11,926
Even as a baby,
she was completely fascinated with them.

498
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:16,527
Yeah, he's the same.
He likes extinct animals.

499
00:51:18,706 --> 00:51:20,037
I'm John.

500
00:51:21,341 --> 00:51:22,865
Hi. Diana.

501
00:51:23,977 --> 00:51:25,308
What are they doing now?

502
00:51:25,378 --> 00:51:27,869
Caleb's showing her something
in sign language.

503
00:51:27,948 --> 00:51:30,780
- I'm sorry. I didn't realize...
- He's not.

504
00:51:32,251 --> 00:51:35,345
Sounds just get jumbled up sometimes.

505
00:51:36,555 --> 00:51:40,490
He has a hearing aid, which helps,
but he's not deaf.

506
00:51:40,558 --> 00:51:43,118
He is an expert in sign language.

507
00:51:44,629 --> 00:51:47,427
I don't think it's ever been this hot
in October.

508
00:51:47,498 --> 00:51:49,125
Air conditioner must be out.

509
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,167
Dad, can we get a drink?

510
00:51:51,235 --> 00:51:52,759
Can we get one, too?

511
00:51:52,836 --> 00:51:55,600
Hey, would you and Abby like to join us?

512
00:51:56,907 --> 00:51:58,772
Sure, that'd be nice.

513
00:51:59,609 --> 00:52:01,008
Abby, this is John.

514
00:52:01,077 --> 00:52:02,442
Hi.
Hey, Abby.

515
00:52:02,912 --> 00:52:03,901
What's that over there?

516
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:06,972
It can be tough sometimes,
because, you know, I'm by myself.

517
00:52:07,049 --> 00:52:08,845
I know how you feel.

518
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:11,909
- You're a single parent, too?
- Yeah.

519
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:13,979
I kicked him out years ago.

520
00:52:14,055 --> 00:52:16,080
He couldn't keep his hands to himself,

521
00:52:16,157 --> 00:52:19,489
so I decided he couldn't keep me
to himself either.

522
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:23,587
Well, it's... It's his loss.

523
00:52:25,733 --> 00:52:28,257
And you? You're separated, or...

524
00:52:29,402 --> 00:52:30,960
Diana,

525
00:52:33,006 --> 00:52:35,474
we didn't meet here by accident.

526
00:52:37,176 --> 00:52:40,633
I need to talk to you about something,

527
00:52:40,712 --> 00:52:44,307
ask you something about your mother.

528
00:52:46,852 --> 00:52:49,979
My mother? What about my mother?

529
00:52:50,054 --> 00:52:55,151
Did she have some kind of ability?

530
00:52:56,626 --> 00:52:58,560
Ability?

531
00:52:58,628 --> 00:53:01,028
A gift of some kind?

532
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:06,129
- Who are you?
- Yeah, it's awkward. You don't know me.

533
00:53:06,201 --> 00:53:09,659
I'm John Koestler.
I teach astrophysics at MIT.

534
00:53:09,738 --> 00:53:11,797
My son goes to William Dawes Elementary,

535
00:53:11,874 --> 00:53:14,775
which is the same school
your mother went to.

536
00:53:14,843 --> 00:53:20,508
Fifty years ago, she put this
in a time capsule. It's a list of dates,

537
00:53:20,581 --> 00:53:25,677
events that I think
she believed would happen.

538
00:53:25,752 --> 00:53:27,049
Look, I don't know
what any of this is about...

539
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,418
And I thought if I could talk to you
or your father...

540
00:53:29,489 --> 00:53:31,184
My father's dead.

541
00:53:33,493 --> 00:53:37,861
I think it's possible that there are people,
like your mother, Lucinda,

542
00:53:37,930 --> 00:53:40,125
who can see things before they occur.

543
00:53:40,199 --> 00:53:42,565
Abby, we're leaving!

544
00:53:42,635 --> 00:53:43,932
Honey?

545
00:53:45,236 --> 00:53:46,965
I followed one of your mother's predictions

546
00:53:47,038 --> 00:53:50,201
and I watched 81 people burn to death
in that plane crash yesterday,

547
00:53:50,275 --> 00:53:53,108
when she said it would happen,
where she said it would happen,

548
00:53:53,178 --> 00:53:55,042
and there was nothing I could do about it.

549
00:53:55,112 --> 00:53:58,013
She says 170 people will die tomorrow
in New York City,

550
00:53:58,082 --> 00:54:00,880
and in three days' time,
October 19th, 33 more.

551
00:54:00,951 --> 00:54:03,476
Stay away from me and my daughter.

552
00:54:04,721 --> 00:54:08,213
Abby? Let's go, honey. Come on.

553
00:54:14,896 --> 00:54:17,023
Stay right there. Diana?

554
00:54:17,632 --> 00:54:19,327
Diana, I think this has something
to do with my son.

555
00:54:19,401 --> 00:54:20,527
Get in there, honey.

556
00:54:20,602 --> 00:54:23,126
I don't know how, or why,
but I think he's in danger.

557
00:54:23,204 --> 00:54:26,298
So I'm asking you please, please help us.

558
00:54:28,175 --> 00:54:29,574
I can't.

559
00:54:47,226 --> 00:54:50,059
<i>A class-action suit
brought by the families of the victims</i>

560
00:54:50,129 --> 00:54:52,995
<i>is meant to be heard beginning next month.</i>

561

<i>an attack on a major East Coast city

<i>Police have urged citizens to stay vigilant.</i>

567
00:55:52,651 --> 00:55:54,209
<i>FBI New York,
how may I direct your call?</i>

568
00:55:54,286 --> 00:55:57,949
The attack will take place tomorrow at
the corner of Lafayette and Worth Streets.

569
00:55:58,023 --> 00:56:00,786
Cordon off the area from midnight.
Are you clear on that?

570
00:56:00,858 --> 00:56:02,291
<i>Sir, let me patch you through
to our agents...</i>

571
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:06,159
Please! Do exactly as I say
or many people will die.

572
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:08,356
This is not a crank call.

573
00:56:12,569 --> 00:56:15,800
You said you'd take him off my hands.

574
00:56:41,561 --> 00:56:44,689
I know there's something
you're not telling me.

575
00:56:45,732 --> 00:56:47,995
Don't let him watch the news.

576
00:57:14,258 --> 00:57:17,351
<i>Well, traffic on the FDR
right now is looking pretty heavy,</i>

577
00:57:17,426 --> 00:57:19,724
<i>this gridlock we're looking at
probably won't let up for hours.</i>

578
00:57:19,795 --> 00:57:23,094
<i>Most of this traffic is headed
downtown to the Westside...</i>

579
00:58:11,475 --> 00:58:13,339
Why hasn't this intersection
been sealed off?

580
00:58:13,410 --> 00:58:14,468
Excuse me?

581
00:58:14,544 --> 00:58:16,705
I said why hasn't this intersection
been sealed off?

582
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:20,011
- Didn't you get the tip-off about the attack?
- Sir. Sir, please calm down.

583
00:58:20,781 --> 00:58:24,614
If you'll accompany me,
we'll get this matter taken care of.

584
00:58:24,684 --> 00:58:25,981
Sir, stop!

585
00:58:26,052 --> 00:58:27,952
Hey, man.
Stop!

586
00:58:31,224 --> 00:58:33,783
I got him. Let's go! Move! Move!

587
00:59:55,265 --> 00:59:57,631
Suspect sighted. Platform three.

588
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:05,337
Hey!

589
01:00:06,943 --> 01:00:08,933
Out of the way! Let me through!

590
01:00:09,011 --> 01:00:10,501
Forward car.

591
01:00:21,589 --> 01:00:23,056
- Get off the train.
- Why? What's wrong?

592
01:00:23,124 --> 01:00:24,318
Just take the baby and get off the train.

593
01:00:24,392 --> 01:00:26,155
What's your problem, pal?

594
01:00:26,227 --> 01:00:28,456
Hold it right there, sir.

595
01:00:30,397 --> 01:00:32,592
Transit police. I'm asking you to stop!

596
01:00:32,665 --> 01:00:35,259
That's him! You have to stop him!

597
01:00:39,138 --> 01:00:42,164
Transit police. Turn around.

598
01:00:43,842 --> 01:00:45,002
Now!

599
01:00:45,844 --> 01:00:47,902
Put your hands up!

600
01:00:47,979 --> 01:00:51,210
Please! Please, I won't do it again,
I promise! I'll give them back!

601
01:00:51,282 --> 01:00:54,115
I'll give them back! I'll give them back.

602
01:00:59,256 --> 01:01:00,917
<i>Next stop, Spring.</i>

603
01:01:23,178 --> 01:01:25,771
Move back! Move back!

604
01:01:32,419 --> 01:01:34,147
Get out of the way!

605
01:02:41,247 --> 01:02:43,613
Move outside.

606
01:03:28,156 --> 01:03:32,114
<i>Make their way through

No, I'm fine. I'll see you in 30 minutes.

618
01:04:09,526 --> 01:04:12,086
Three, four, five...
Five, six...

619
01:04:36,950 --> 01:04:38,645
Caleb, go inside.

620
01:04:41,421 --> 01:04:43,150
- Hey.
- Hi.

621
01:04:43,223 --> 01:04:46,555
- Want to check out the house?
- Sure.

622
01:04:52,965 --> 01:04:54,956
You said October 19th?

623
01:04:57,936 --> 01:05:01,337
My mother used to talk about that day
all the time.

624
01:05:05,009 --> 01:05:06,533
She said it was the day I was going to die.

625
01:05:21,124 --> 01:05:25,560
All my life I've had this thing
hanging over my head

626
01:05:25,627 --> 01:05:27,117
and Abby's.

627
01:05:29,064 --> 01:05:32,465
I just don't believe
anyone can predict my future.

628
01:05:35,403 --> 01:05:37,894
And what does it matter, anyway?

629
01:05:40,007 --> 01:05:41,941
We all die in the end.

630
01:05:44,144 --> 01:05:47,136
I don't want to know what my future holds.

631
01:05:53,352 --> 01:05:58,415
Last year, my wife was on
a business trip to Phoenix

632
01:05:59,358 --> 01:06:01,826
a few days before my birthday

633
01:06:02,927 --> 01:06:08,695
and a fire started in her hotel
at 4:00 in the morning.

634
01:06:10,835 --> 01:06:14,235
The investigators said
that Allison died of smoke inhalation.

635
01:06:14,304 --> 01:06:16,829
Died in her sleep.

636
01:06:16,907 --> 01:06:20,070
She wouldn't have known
anything about it.

637
01:06:22,945 --> 01:06:27,609
While she was dying,
I was at home, in the front yard.

638
01:06:30,152 --> 01:06:32,119
I always thought
you were supposed to sense

639
01:06:32,187 --> 01:06:35,020
when the people you love are in danger,

640
01:06:37,559 --> 01:06:39,720
but I didn't feel anything.

641
01:06:40,928 --> 01:06:42,395
Nothing.

642
01:06:45,265 --> 01:06:50,134
I was just blowing leaves off the lawn.

643
01:06:52,004 --> 01:06:53,938
I'm so sorry, John.

644
01:06:54,006 --> 01:06:58,306
Well, but my point is that from then on,

645
01:06:58,378 --> 01:07:03,508
I decided that no one can know
what was coming,

646
01:07:05,117 --> 01:07:10,611
and life was just a string
of random accidents and mistakes.

647
01:07:13,958 --> 01:07:16,483
And then I got that list.

648
01:07:19,929 --> 01:07:25,265
If that had come to me before Allison left,
I would have saved her life.

649
01:07:29,271 --> 01:07:30,932
I need to know.

650
01:07:57,197 --> 01:07:58,891
It's still here.

651
01:08:27,790 --> 01:08:29,314
What's this?

652
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:32,591
Have you seen this?

653
01:08:34,096 --> 01:08:38,156
Abby used to do this sometimes,
write things backwards,

654
01:08:39,201 --> 01:08:42,261
and that last number, I don't think it's 33.

655
01:08:43,138 --> 01:08:44,571
It's EE.

656
01:08:47,007 --> 01:08:51,307
EE? Initials. Someone she knew?

657
01:08:52,847 --> 01:08:54,314
I don't know.

658
01:09:18,302 --> 01:09:20,668
I was nine when she overdosed.

659
01:09:21,939 --> 01:09:25,396
The only time I ever came out here
was with my father

660
01:09:26,510 --> 01:09:29,377
when he identified her body.

661
01:09:29,446 --> 01:09:31,914
She willed the property to me,

662
01:09:34,316 --> 01:09:37,342
but I never came back for any of her things.

663
01:09:54,101 --> 01:09:58,561
When I was little, my mother used
to tell me that she could hear voices

664
01:10:00,607 --> 01:10:02,733
whispering to her,

665
01:10:04,610 --> 01:10:07,135
telling her horrible things.

666
01:10:08,314 --> 01:10:13,012
And then one day,
my dad came and took me away from her.

667
01:10:14,252 --> 01:10:16,379
He said she was sick.

668
01:10:21,392 --> 01:10:24,259
She said she moved out here to get ready.

669
01:10:26,463 --> 01:10:29,125
I never knew what she meant by that.

670
01:10:34,370 --> 01:10:37,032
I made this for her one Christmas.

671
01:10:42,311 --> 01:10:44,541
I never knew she kept it.

672
01:11:34,558 --> 01:11:37,584
She used to stare at this picture for hours.

673
01:11:53,508 --> 01:11:55,703
That's where they found her.

674
01:11:58,078 --> 01:11:59,477
In there.

675
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:32,232
Have you seen enough?

676
01:12:33,844 --> 01:12:35,811
Yeah. Okay. We'll go.

677
01:12:54,329 --> 01:12:55,488
Abby?

678
01:12:56,297 --> 01:12:57,491
Abby?

679
01:13:19,251 --> 01:13:21,913
<i>Abby.</i>

680
01:13:30,995 --> 01:13:32,394
<i>Caleb.</i>

681
01:13:39,670 --> 01:13:41,160
<i>Come.</i>

682
01:13:42,572 --> 01:13:45,063
<i>Come with us.</i>

683
01:13:56,718 --> 01:13:58,777
EE isn't just one person.

684
01:14:16,236 --> 01:14:17,567
Abby, no!

685
01:14:27,146 --> 01:14:28,443
Abby!

686
01:14:29,014 --> 01:14:32,676
What? What? What? It's okay. It's okay.

687
01:14:32,750 --> 01:14:34,411
They were here.

688
01:14:34,485 --> 01:14:37,283
Who? Who was here, Caleb?

689
01:14:37,355 --> 01:14:41,950
- Did they hurt you?
- No. They were talking to us.

690
01:14:42,025 --> 01:14:47,327
- What did they say?
- I don't know. They were all talking at once.

691
01:14:47,397 --> 01:14:51,332
They said we could go with them,
if we chose to.

692
01:14:53,068 --> 01:14:58,062
- Who did, baby? Who?
- The whisper people.

693
01:15:15,022 --> 01:15:16,990
Hey, lock the doors.

694
01:15:40,277 --> 01:15:42,575
What do you want with my son?

695
01:15:48,251 --> 01:15:49,684
Answer me!

696
01:16:20,313 --> 01:16:22,747
I just know they've been following us
for days.

697
01:16:22,816 --> 01:16:26,046
I think someone's been following me
and Abby, too.

698
01:16:35,526 --> 01:16:39,553
That's why she didn't write
any coordinates down after the final date.

699
01:16:39,631 --> 01:16:42,862
There isn't a single location this time.

700
01:16:42,934 --> 01:16:48,030
Are you telling me that my mother
could see the end of everything?

701
01:16:50,140 --> 01:16:53,166
That we're all going to die tomorrow?

702
01:16:53,243 --> 01:16:58,874
She was disturbed, John.
She could've just made it all up.

703
01:17:00,182 --> 01:17:02,514
She's been right so far, Diana.

704
01:17:04,819 --> 01:17:06,548
About everything.

705
01:17:08,924 --> 01:17:12,758
Abby's... Abby's all I've got, John.

706
01:17:12,827 --> 01:17:15,420
I can't let anything happen to her.

707
01:18:13,848 --> 01:18:16,908
Caleb, you really need to sleep.

708
01:18:20,787 --> 01:18:24,951
I can hear them whispering to me
sometimes like Abby can.

709
01:18:26,259 --> 01:18:28,591
Could Lucinda hear them, too?

710
01:18:35,801 --> 01:18:37,962
Yeah, I think she did. Yes.

711
01:18:39,971 --> 01:18:42,098
Are me and Abby gonna die?

712
01:18:46,311 --> 01:18:51,179
No. I will never let that happen, Caleb.

713
01:18:52,249 --> 01:18:54,649
Do you hear me? Never.

714
01:18:59,555 --> 01:19:00,817
You...

715
01:19:18,773 --> 01:19:21,970
Abby, what do you like to eat for breakfast?

716
01:19:23,377 --> 01:19:24,639
Abby?

717
01:19:27,580 --> 01:19:29,707
What are you doing, honey?

718
01:19:31,084 --> 01:19:32,608
It's the sun.

719
01:19:38,557 --> 01:19:41,958
There's something I need to check.
Get Abby, you're coming with us.

720
01:19:42,027 --> 01:19:43,187
Caleb!

721
01:20:00,944 --> 01:20:03,071
Okay. All right.

722
01:20:03,146 --> 01:20:05,273
Hey, John, what happened?

723
01:20:08,217 --> 01:20:09,445
Hey!

724
01:20:12,154 --> 01:20:13,280
Talk to me. What happened?

725
01:20:13,355 --> 01:20:17,688
I've been calling you off the hook
ever since I heard about the subway.

726
01:20:18,660 --> 01:20:19,854
John?

727
01:20:23,465 --> 01:20:26,365
Do you remember that paper
on extra-solar activity I published?

728
01:20:26,433 --> 01:20:27,798
Yeah, sure, I remember.

729
01:20:27,868 --> 01:20:32,066
I found evidence of a series of super-flares
from a star in the outer-Pleiades region.

730
01:20:32,139 --> 01:20:34,334
Right. Ratings were off the chart.

731
01:20:36,242 --> 01:20:39,234
We were both wrong.
The numbers are a warning,

732
01:20:39,312 --> 01:20:42,145
but not just to me or any random group.

733
01:20:44,150 --> 01:20:46,413
They're a warning to everyone.

734
01:20:48,653 --> 01:20:51,918
Okay. You're officially scaring
the shit out of me right now.

735
01:20:53,991 --> 01:20:58,291
The super-flare, in our own solar system.

736
01:20:59,263 --> 01:21:01,527
A 100 microtesla wave of radiation

737
01:21:01,599 --> 01:21:06,797
that would destroy our ozone layer,
killing every living organism on the planet.

738
01:21:13,475 --> 01:21:15,943
We have to let everyone know.
We have to call the NOAA.

739
01:21:16,011 --> 01:21:19,674
They already know.
The announcement will come anytime now.

740
01:21:35,195 --> 01:21:38,824
I thought there was some purpose
to all of this.

741
01:21:38,899 --> 01:21:43,164
Why did I get this prediction
if there's nothing I can do about it?

742
01:21:44,904 --> 01:21:48,135
How am I supposed
to stop the end of the world?

743
01:21:56,247 --> 01:21:59,683
Go home, Phil. Be with Kim tonight.

744
01:22:15,665 --> 01:22:17,223
Diana.

745
01:22:19,302 --> 01:22:21,667
I'm so stupid.

746
01:22:22,370 --> 01:22:26,033
I've spent my whole life
knowing she was right

747
01:22:27,442 --> 01:22:30,205
and pretending that she was insane.

748
01:22:33,881 --> 01:22:37,339
If we hide underground,
we've got a chance, don't we?

749
01:22:38,852 --> 01:22:40,443
It's possible.

750
01:22:41,387 --> 01:22:47,019
I know some caves
off Route 40 past Groton.

751
01:22:47,093 --> 01:22:51,791
Hardly anyone knows about them,
but I used to play there as a child.

752
01:22:51,863 --> 01:22:54,195
We could try there, right?

753
01:22:54,967 --> 01:22:57,128
- Okay.
- Okay.

754
01:23:00,538 --> 01:23:02,563
Caleb, put some clothes and shoes
into your backpack.

755
01:23:02,640 --> 01:23:06,371
Diana, load all the non-perishable food,
any water you can, into the truck.

756
01:23:06,444 --> 01:23:08,070
Let's try to be out of here in 10 minutes.

757
01:23:08,144 --> 01:23:10,738
You start. I'll get some bags.
Yeah.

758
01:24:18,641 --> 01:24:20,939
<i>Allison wanted me to call you</i>

759
01:24:22,512 --> 01:24:25,036
the day she left for Phoenix.

760
01:24:25,113 --> 01:24:28,276
She wanted me to promise her
that I'd call you.

761
01:24:29,518 --> 01:24:31,281
<i>I know, Jonathan.</i>

762
01:24:33,555 --> 01:24:38,787
We haven't spoken in so long,
I don't really even know why anymore.

763
01:24:43,431 --> 01:24:45,830
I need to tell you something.

764
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:48,131
<i>Yes?</i>

765
01:24:49,202 --> 01:24:54,264
That sermon you preached every year
at Pentecost, about the gifts of the Spirit,

766
01:24:55,174 --> 01:24:57,540
one was the gift of prophecy.

767
01:24:57,609 --> 01:25:03,478
<i>1 Corinthians 12. Yes, I remember it.
The church should respect the prophet.</i>

768
01:25:04,882 --> 01:25:06,713
I have a prophecy.

769
01:25:08,653 --> 01:25:11,121
It's about to be proven accurate.

770
01:25:13,857 --> 01:25:17,657
I need you to respect it
and receive it as the truth.

771
01:25:18,762 --> 01:25:21,731
This heat we're experiencing
isn't going to get better.

772
01:25:22,932 --> 01:25:26,390
<i>It's going to get worse, much worse.</i>

773
01:25:28,270 --> 01:25:31,433
I need you to get Mom and Grace
and any supplies you can,

774
01:25:31,507 --> 01:25:36,000
and get below ground tonight.
The basement, the sewer, the T.

775
01:25:36,077 --> 01:25:39,569
Just get as deep as you can
and as fast as you can.

776
01:25:41,249 --> 01:25:44,342
And that will keep us safe from this heat?

777
01:25:47,321 --> 01:25:51,586
I don't know that, but we have to try, right?

778
01:25:53,192 --> 01:25:57,060
<i>I'm sorry, John, but I'm afraid I'm not
going anywhere tonight or any night.</i>

779
01:25:57,130 --> 01:26:01,691
I appreciate your concern,
but if it's my time, it's my time.

780
01:26:03,001 --> 01:26:06,596
I'm ready whenever the good Lord calls me.

781
01:26:06,671 --> 01:26:08,332
<i>Are you?</i>

782
01:26:08,407 --> 01:26:09,897
<i>- Dad?
- Hello?</i>

783
01:26:11,275 --> 01:26:12,833
- John?
- Dad?

784
01:26:27,824 --> 01:26:29,586
Caleb, let's go!

785
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:32,954
Caleb.

786
01:26:36,832 --> 01:26:38,094
Caleb.

787
01:26:46,007 --> 01:26:47,269
Caleb!

788
01:26:50,277 --> 01:26:51,904
Caleb, stop!

789
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:56,275
- Caleb!
- Huh? Huh?

790
01:26:57,284 --> 01:26:59,148
What were you doing?

791
01:27:00,119 --> 01:27:01,780
Did I do that?

792
01:27:11,896 --> 01:27:13,887
This isn't the way to the highway.

793
01:27:19,703 --> 01:27:21,568
Everybody wait here.

794
01:27:23,874 --> 01:27:25,102
John!

795
01:27:28,478 --> 01:27:29,775
John!

796
01:28:05,111 --> 01:28:08,102
John, please, why are we back here?

797
01:28:13,118 --> 01:28:16,814
John, please, what are you doing?
We have to get to the caves.

798
01:28:16,888 --> 01:28:20,346
- We're not going to the caves.
- What?

799
01:28:20,424 --> 01:28:22,085
She knew the coordinates
for this last event.

800
01:28:22,159 --> 01:28:23,558
She tried to write them down.

801
01:28:23,628 --> 01:28:27,791
The teacher said she was interrupted,
ran out of time,

802
01:28:27,864 --> 01:28:31,163
so she scratched them into this door.

803
01:28:31,234 --> 01:28:33,259
She tried to tell us where to go.

804
01:28:33,336 --> 01:28:36,771
You're not making any sense.
Look at you. Look at what you're doing!

805
01:28:36,839 --> 01:28:38,932
The numbers are the key to everything.

806
01:28:39,008 --> 01:28:41,875
Please! Please, John, we need to leave!

807
01:28:49,350 --> 01:28:53,342
We're taking my car. Come on.
Let's go. Keep your bags with you.

808
01:28:56,757 --> 01:28:58,850
Be here, please, be here.

809
01:28:59,793 --> 01:29:01,658
Throw it in the back.

810
01:29:05,865 --> 01:29:07,389
What about Dad?

811
01:29:07,466 --> 01:29:11,425
He's just gotta finish what he's doing.
He's gonna follow us.

812
01:29:11,504 --> 01:29:13,471
We're just getting a head start, okay?

813
01:29:35,325 --> 01:29:36,792
Diana?

814
01:29:46,835 --> 01:29:48,097
Caleb!

815
01:29:49,638 --> 01:29:50,968
Caleb!

816
01:29:53,274 --> 01:29:54,605
Caleb!

817
01:29:56,344 --> 01:29:57,675
Caleb!

818
01:30:21,699 --> 01:30:26,159
Where are we going, Mom?
Are we hiding from the whisper people?

819
01:30:26,237 --> 01:30:31,037
Yes, baby.
They won't find us where we're going.

820
01:30:31,108 --> 01:30:33,770
Mom, they know where we are.

821
01:30:35,278 --> 01:30:38,338
- How do you know that?
- They told us so.

822
01:30:39,415 --> 01:30:43,875
- You've seen them again?
- No. They just talk to us.

823
01:30:46,622 --> 01:30:49,852
How, Abby? How do they talk to you?

824
01:30:49,924 --> 01:30:52,893
They whisper into our heads.

825
01:30:54,095 --> 01:30:55,323
Oh, God.

826
01:31:03,871 --> 01:31:05,202
Oh, God.

827
01:31:05,272 --> 01:31:07,398
- I want to call my dad.
- The phones are down!

828
01:31:07,473 --> 01:31:11,204
I promise he's right behind us!
We'll call him when we get there!

829
01:31:21,119 --> 01:31:22,814
Wait right here!

830
01:31:22,888 --> 01:31:25,982
<i>Now let's get back to the
financial markets, if we may, for a moment.</i>

831
01:31:26,058 --> 01:31:29,288
<i>Let's check it out on the grid here this
morning. We've got Treasuries moving up...</i>

832
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:31,851
Yeah, thanks. Thanks, man.

833
01:31:32,630 --> 01:31:33,619
Number five.

834
01:31:33,698 --> 01:31:35,859
<i>... India is a better bet than the US
or Europe,</i>

835
01:31:35,933 --> 01:31:38,526
<i>and that the dollar will continue
its long slide...</i>

836
01:31:38,601 --> 01:31:39,625
20.

837
01:31:39,703 --> 01:31:42,263
<i>This is an Emergency
Broadcast Transmission.</i>

838
01:31:45,275 --> 01:31:49,938
<i>This is not a test. This is
an Emergency Broadcast Transmission.</i>

839
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:54,376
<i>Today, NO AA has concluded...
- Turn that up!</i>

840
01:31:54,450 --> 01:31:55,814
<i>... the solar flares may last longer</i>

841
01:31:55,883 --> 01:31:59,341
<i>and cause more damage to our
infrastructure than we originally thought.</i>

842
01:31:59,420 --> 01:32:02,321
<i>We're recommending that people
stay indoors until further notice.</i>

843
01:32:02,390 --> 01:32:05,722
<i>Bring your pets inside.
Stock up on extra water and, if possible,</i>

844
01:32:05,792 --> 01:32:08,556
<i>seek out fortified underground shelter.</i>

845
01:32:08,628 --> 01:32:12,689
<i>- General, what time is it happening?
- General, excuse me...</i>

846
01:32:19,138 --> 01:32:22,005
<i>The shelters we have
are currently overwhelmed.</i>

847
01:32:22,074 --> 01:32:24,871
<i>The best advice we can offer the public
is to seek your own.</i>

848
01:32:24,943 --> 01:32:25,967
<i>Sir!</i>

849
01:32:26,044 --> 01:32:27,443
<i>One more question about the warning.</i>

850
01:32:27,512 --> 01:32:29,639
<i>We are assessing this information
as it becomes available.</i>

851
01:32:29,714 --> 01:32:30,806
<i>It was only recently confirmed.</i>

852
01:32:30,882 --> 01:32:32,076
<i>Where is the President?</i>

853
01:32:32,150 --> 01:32:33,344
<i>The President and his staff</i>

854
01:32:33,418 --> 01:32:36,818
<i>are currently being transported
to a secure location.</i>

855
01:32:36,887 --> 01:32:37,911
<i>Hello?
- Dad?</i>

856
01:32:37,988 --> 01:32:41,515
Caleb, are you okay?
Tell me exactly where you are.

857
01:32:41,592 --> 01:32:44,116
We're at a gas station. I don't know where.

858
01:32:48,865 --> 01:32:52,232
<i>The damage information regarding
the destructive power of these flares</i>

859
01:32:52,301 --> 01:32:54,131
<i>is a scientific matter,
and I'm not gonna speculate...</i>

860
01:32:54,202 --> 01:32:55,760
Are you coming with us?

861
01:32:55,837 --> 01:32:58,203
<i>I need you to stay right there.
Get me an...</i>

862
01:32:58,273 --> 01:33:00,537
Caleb, get back to the car now.

863
01:33:00,609 --> 01:33:01,803
<i>Caleb?
- John?</i>

864
01:33:01,877 --> 01:33:03,741
<i>- Where are you?
We're in Westford.</i>

865
01:33:03,811 --> 01:33:07,178
I'm sorry.
I had to do this for Abby and for Caleb.

866
01:33:07,248 --> 01:33:10,046
- I'm taking them to the caves.
- I found the numbers!

867
01:33:10,117 --> 01:33:12,141
They're the location
of your mother's mobile home.

868
01:33:12,218 --> 01:33:13,685
That's where we've got to go.

869
01:33:13,753 --> 01:33:17,280
- Don't do this to me. Please.
- I know how it sounds.

870
01:33:17,357 --> 01:33:19,917
You want us to head toward the place
where this is supposed to happen?

871
01:33:19,993 --> 01:33:21,017
<i>Are you insane?</i>

872
01:33:21,094 --> 01:33:23,755
It's a chance we gotta take
or we're all gonna die!

873
01:33:23,829 --> 01:33:25,558
Stay where you are! I'll be right there!

874
01:33:25,631 --> 01:33:27,929
No! If we go to the caves,
we have a chance!

875
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:29,968
You said the sun can't reach that far!

876
01:33:30,035 --> 01:33:33,663
The caves won't save us! Nothing can!

877
01:33:34,272 --> 01:33:37,935
The radiation will penetrate a mile
into the Earth's crust! Do you hear me?

878
01:33:38,009 --> 01:33:40,341
<i>Our only shot is to go
where the numbers want us to go.</i>

879
01:33:40,411 --> 01:33:43,208
<i>- It's what we're meant to do!
- No, I don't believe you!</i>

880
01:33:43,280 --> 01:33:45,544
I'm taking the children!
We have to save the children!

881
01:33:45,615 --> 01:33:50,574
<i>Don't you move, Diana! Caleb is my son,
and I'll decide where he goes!</i>

882
01:33:52,021 --> 01:33:55,184
<i>Diana! Caleb! Are you there?</i>

883
01:34:03,097 --> 01:34:04,394
Abby!

884
01:34:06,234 --> 01:34:08,759
Abby! Abby!

885
01:34:09,536 --> 01:34:12,596
Help! Somebody took my daughter!

886
01:34:24,984 --> 01:34:26,474
Abby!

887
01:34:35,327 --> 01:34:36,692
Damn it!

888
01:35:14,028 --> 01:35:15,757
Where did she go?

889
01:35:57,400 --> 01:35:59,300
<i>Everyone needs to do this immediately.</i>

890
01:35:59,368 --> 01:36:02,269
<i>We are facing a natural threat
of global proportions,</i>

891
01:36:02,338 --> 01:36:04,101
<i>and there is very little
that this government...</i>

892
01:36:04,173 --> 01:36:06,140
Same thing happened with Y2K.

893
01:36:06,207 --> 01:36:09,836
They are gonna wake up tomorrow morning
feeling pretty stupid.

894
01:36:09,911 --> 01:36:12,311
Thirty minutes ago there was
a woman here. She was screaming!

895
01:36:12,380 --> 01:36:15,815
She was with a kid! He was on your
pay phone! He's a nine-year-old kid!

896
01:36:15,883 --> 01:36:19,444
Some guy took the lady's car
with the kids inside. Drove right off with it.

897
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:22,148
- The woman, where'd she go?
- That way!

898
01:36:23,523 --> 01:36:25,684
Go lock the door! Stop that, you crazy...

899
01:36:25,758 --> 01:36:29,091
You've got to pay for that! Hey, stop!

900
01:36:29,162 --> 01:36:31,096
<i>You need to
seek protection from the sun</i>

901
01:36:31,164 --> 01:36:32,825
<i>and it needs to be immediately.</i>

902
01:36:32,899 --> 01:36:35,298
<i>We're facing a deadly threat.</i>

903
01:36:46,811 --> 01:36:48,972
Get out!
I didn't see you!

904
01:36:59,155 --> 01:37:00,986
Hey! Get out of here!

905
01:37:07,262 --> 01:37:11,289
- Is she... Where are the children?
- We can't help you now, sir.

906
01:37:20,975 --> 01:37:23,568
Calm down, all of you!
Just calm down!

907
01:37:25,445 --> 01:37:26,707
Charge.

908
01:37:28,081 --> 01:37:29,446
Clear.

909
01:37:33,419 --> 01:37:35,114
Again.

910
01:37:35,187 --> 01:37:36,484
Clear.

911
01:37:43,061 --> 01:37:46,155
- Okay, call it.
- 12:00 midnight exactly.

912
01:37:47,232 --> 01:37:49,757
There's a man down. We need help.

913
01:38:15,824 --> 01:38:17,121
Diana.

914
01:38:21,662 --> 01:38:23,152
I'm sorry.

915
01:40:30,811 --> 01:40:32,142
Caleb!

916
01:40:53,731 --> 01:40:55,255
Where is he?

917
01:40:56,601 --> 01:40:58,193
Where's Caleb?

918
01:40:58,937 --> 01:41:00,461
I want my son!

919
01:41:01,838 --> 01:41:04,238
I want my son!

920
01:41:05,642 --> 01:41:07,007
Now!

921
01:41:07,077 --> 01:41:08,271
Dad, don't!

922
01:41:17,353 --> 01:41:19,878
Are you hurt? What did he do to you?

923
01:41:19,956 --> 01:41:23,584
It's okay, Dad. I'm okay. This is my friend.

924
01:41:25,026 --> 01:41:27,153
They said I can keep him.

925
01:41:34,168 --> 01:41:36,136
Caleb, I want you to come with me.
We're going now.

926
01:41:36,203 --> 01:41:38,398
But we have to go with them.

927
01:41:40,039 --> 01:41:41,836
They won't hurt us.

928
01:41:43,243 --> 01:41:45,905
Abby, are you okay?

929
01:41:46,713 --> 01:41:49,375
- Your mom wanted to be here, honey.
I know.

930
01:41:49,448 --> 01:41:52,679
The whisper people told me
that Mommy's safe now.

931
01:41:52,751 --> 01:41:55,686
They've been protecting us all along, Dad.

932
01:41:55,754 --> 01:41:59,553
They sent a message ahead of them
to prepare the way,

933
01:41:59,624 --> 01:42:01,854
and now they've come for us.

934
01:42:04,729 --> 01:42:06,253
Who are you?

935
01:43:01,246 --> 01:43:05,910
It's time to go, Dad.
They've chosen us so we can start over.

936
01:43:05,984 --> 01:43:08,383
So everything can start over.

937
01:43:46,119 --> 01:43:49,646
What do you mean? I don't understand.

938
01:43:53,793 --> 01:43:56,090
Why is he saying that, Dad?

939
01:43:57,062 --> 01:43:58,393
What?

940
01:43:59,832 --> 01:44:01,993
What's he saying, Caleb?

941
01:44:02,067 --> 01:44:05,695
He's saying only the chosen must go,

942
01:44:07,872 --> 01:44:09,999
those who heard the call.

943
01:44:14,811 --> 01:44:16,244
Please.

944
01:44:52,445 --> 01:44:57,212
I can't go with you, Caleb.
I mean, I can't go with you.

945
01:44:58,351 --> 01:45:00,717
They've chosen us to go.

946
01:45:02,554 --> 01:45:04,886
They haven't chosen us, Caleb.

947
01:45:06,291 --> 01:45:09,260
They've chosen you, both of you.

948
01:45:13,798 --> 01:45:18,098
You have to take care of Abby now.
You have to be strong for her.

949
01:45:22,405 --> 01:45:26,205
No. I don't want to go without you.

950
01:45:27,877 --> 01:45:32,074
They could've taken you away from me,
but they didn't,

951
01:45:33,081 --> 01:45:36,244
because you have to make
this decision yourself.

952
01:45:36,318 --> 01:45:38,718
But you promised.

953
01:45:38,787 --> 01:45:42,153
You said we'd be together forever.

954
01:45:42,223 --> 01:45:46,717
We will be. We will be. I'm not leaving you.

955
01:45:46,794 --> 01:45:50,524
But you gotta go with them.
You gotta go. You gotta go with them.

956
01:45:50,597 --> 01:45:55,364
Caleb, Caleb, listen to me, Caleb.
Stop, stop. Stop. Listen to me. Listen.

957
01:45:55,435 --> 01:45:59,063
We're gonna be together.
We're all gonna be together.

958
01:45:59,138 --> 01:46:01,106
And Mom's gonna be with us, too.

959
01:46:01,173 --> 01:46:05,007
I know it. I know that now. I know it.

960
01:46:07,112 --> 01:46:10,569
Look. Here. Take this.

961
01:46:10,648 --> 01:46:13,776
Take this. Keep it with you.

962
01:46:15,119 --> 01:46:17,780
One day, you'll know what it means.

963
01:46:25,295 --> 01:46:27,058
I love you, Daddy.

964
01:52:43,667 --> 01:52:45,225
Where's Caleb?

965
01:52:46,469 --> 01:52:48,061
Caleb's safe.

966
01:52:49,706 --> 01:52:52,538
<i>We're going to stay on the air
for as long as possible.</i>

967
01:52:53,642 --> 01:52:56,975
<i>All we can say is what
we've been repeating all morning.</i>

968
01:52:57,046 --> 01:52:59,844
<i>Get to any kind of underground shelter.</i>

969
01:53:01,816 --> 01:53:04,216
<i>We've been told the satellite...</i>

970
01:53:21,667 --> 01:53:24,227
This isn't the end, Son.

971
01:53:24,303 --> 01:53:25,634
I know.

972
01:53:26,305 --> 01:54:26,877
