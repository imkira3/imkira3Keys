1
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,020
Day after day...

2
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,020
The store that one might...

3
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:19,260
I hate television.
It gives me headaches.

4
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,460
There's so many magnetic waves
traveling in the airspace

5
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,820
because of TV and television,
we're losing

6
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,820
10 times as many brain cells
as we're supposed to.

7
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,260
Oh, please.

8
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,180
"The cow says blank."

9
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,300
Three letters.

10
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,860
Dude!

11
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,260
"Dude"!

12
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:40,140
I don't know.
Magnetic waves, brain cells.

13
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,460
I don't understand the
connection between that stuff.

14
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:44,260
You know what else I heard?

15
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,460
Magnetic waves shrink
silicone molecules.

16
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:52,380
Oh, my God!
Turn it off!

17
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:53,420
It's not working!

18
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:54,380
It's backwards!

19
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,620
- What do we do?
- I don't know!

20
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,540
Oh, my God!

21
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,580
That was kind of scary.

22
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,700
- I know something even scarier.
- What?

23
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,100
Have you heard about
this videotape?

24
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,260
Where they do it on the boat?
And then in the car?

25
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,300
And then in the bathtub?

26
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:11,380
He's like, "Baby, I love you."
And she's like, "Where are we?"

27
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,900
- And did you see the...
- No.

28
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:14,460
Not that tape.

29
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,300
The one with
all the scary images.

30
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,740
After you watch the tape,
the phone rings.

31
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,860
And this scary voice comes on
and says you're gonna die in...

32
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,340
Seven days. I saw that one
with Josh last weekend.

33
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:26,500
You were with Josh last weekend?

34
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,660
Oh, my God!

35
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,500
Oh, yes, I was.

36
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,300
Oh, you ho!

37
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,140
You know it!

38
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,460
This is really weird.

39
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:54,900
Yeah.

40
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:57,980
Big house, only one phone.

41
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,300
Hello?

42
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,660
Hello?

43
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:14,780
I'm coming for you, my precious.

44
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:15,820
Hi, Mom.

45
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,300
Hi, precious.
Having fun?

46
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,300
Hey, ask her which bathroom has
the vibrating showerhead.

47
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,140
Hello?

48
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:26,860
Hello?

49
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,620
Katie?

50
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,700
Katie?

51
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,340
Katie?

52
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,380
Are you okay?

53
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,860
Are you okay?

54
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,540
God!

55
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,460
Tom, did you hear...

56
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,980
The dogs are acting strange.

57
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,780
Sue!

58
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,140
What are you doing out here?

59
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,700
We were worried sick.

60
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:17,900
What's wrong?

61
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,740
I wonder what they're
trying to tell us.

62
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:38,900
And now...

63
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,980
Washington DC's
leading morning news program,

64
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,500
"The Morning News."

65
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,060
Good morning.
I'm Ross Giggins.

66
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,620
For our top story,
we turn now to Cindy Campbell.

67
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,940
Thank you, Ross.

68
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,580
There's a developing story
in Middleburg at this hour.

69
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,460
A mysterious
crop circle appeared

70
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,260
in local farmer Tom Logan's
cornfield.

71
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:59,780
Elaborate prank
or extraterrestrial phenomenon?

72
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:02,860
We'll update you as soon as we
have any further information.

73
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,100
But either way,
it's clear something strange

74
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,100
is happening in that small town.

75
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,900
Ross?

76
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,860
I'm sorry.
I wasn't listening.

77
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:13,140
Coming up, more news after this.

78
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,540
- Cindy, you got a second?
- Sure.

79
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:19,620
I want you to take a look at
this for that strip club exposé.

80
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,620
But I'd rather stick with
the crop circle story.

81
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,900
Oh, come on. You know
those things are just a hoax.

82
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,780
No, I'm telling you, I sense
something about that cornfield.

83
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,620
Call it women's intuition
or ESPN or both.

84
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,580
But I can tell
when danger's near.

85
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,380
My eyes!

86
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:38,580
Cindy, it's sweeps month.
Ratings mean everything.

87
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:41,300
People want
human interest stories.

88
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,940
Like the one you did yesterday.

89
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,540
The report
on breast augmentation?

90
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,900
It was just 10 minutes
of topless women.

91
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:49,260
I mean, come on.

92
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,140
Why are these so interesting?

93
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,580
Oh, for God's sake.

94
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,700
People don't care about this.

95
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:59,180
They want hard-hitting stories
and in-depth coverage and...

96
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,420
And twins!

97
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,340
You think it was
the Kreisel boys

98
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,620
who cut that stuff
into your corn?

99
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,740
All I know is my crops are gone.

100
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,940
The bank's gonna foreclose
if I can't pay the rent.

101
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:32,220
I got 60 days
to come up with $ 1.50.

102
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,900
I'm sorry.

103
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,140
The last thing you needed
was more...

104
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:40,060
...hardship in your life.

105
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,700
Especially after
what happened to...

106
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,060
Sheriff, I don't need
your sympathy.

107
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,740
I didn't mean to upset you,
Father.

108
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:49,820
Please.
I'm not a minister anymore.

109
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,860
I lost my faith
that terrible night.

110
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,500
Your faith will return.

111
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:57,340
Just as sure
as the sun will rise.

112
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,700
Sounds like a long shot.

113
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,820
Look, there's always
an explanation

114
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,980
for all this so-called
phenomena.

115
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,180
Maybe you're right.

116
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,420
It was probably
just the Kreisels.

117
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,180
And when I get through
with them,

118
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,660
I doubt you'll be seeing
anything strange on this farm

119
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,940
for a long time.

120
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,860
You'll see.

121
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:18,220
You all right, Tom?
Get some rest.

122
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,220
George!

123
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,500
George!

124
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:35,380
I need you back here tomorrow
night after you pick up Sue.

125
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,740
That tractor needs fixing.

126
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:39,820
Sorry, dawg. I can't help you.
I have to get ready for my show.

127
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,780
Not that stupid
hip-hop stuff again.

128
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,220
Damn it, when are you going to
do something with your life?

129
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:45,980
I got a dream!

130
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,180
- What is your dream?
- To have a dream.

131
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,820
George, all you've done
is chase adolescent fantasies.

132
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,940
"I want to be an astronaut.
A cowboy.

133
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,660
Gynecologist to the stars."

134
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,500
And now this stupid
hip-hop thing.

135
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,540
For your information,

136
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,940
this hip-hop thing is gonna
get me paid.

137
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,940
I'm gonna win that rap battle.

138
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,340
Rap battle?
Oh, for God's sake.

139
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,780
You just hate me
'cause I'm black.

140
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,180
You don't have any faith in me.

141
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,220
You don't have any faith
in anything anymore.

142
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,020
So why don't you just worry
about you,

143
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,940
and I'll worry about...

144
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,780
Cody!

145
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,700
You're late again, Aunt Cindy.

146
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,700
I'm sorry.
I was stuck in traffic.

147
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:39,780
Cindy!

148
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,260
Brenda, hi!

149
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,860
Oh, it's great to see you!

150
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,260
Oh, it's been so long.

151
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,940
Oh, too long.
I've been working so hard.

152
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:51,180
I've had to spend more
and more time at the station.

153
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,980
The news just keeps coming in.

154
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,660
What was the assignment?

155
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,340
Draw your family and friends.

156
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,340
Anyone new in your life, Cindy?

157
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,580
Well, you know, I just haven't
found the right guy.

158
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,180
I'm looking for something more
than just good sex.

159
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,700
I know.
You want commitment.

160
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:10,380
No, I want great sex.
And when I meet that guy...

161
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,700
That's what I'm talking 'bout!

162
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,180
You want a guy that's like,
bam, bam, bam!

163
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,420
You know what I'm saying?

164
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,620
Did I say stop drawing?

165
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,580
Look, when I meet Mr. Right,
I'll know.

166
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,300
Uncle George!

167
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,500
Hey, sweetie!
Come here!

168
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,140
How are you?

169
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,780
Go get your stuff, okay?

170
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,220
I know you.

171
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,340
You're Tom Logan's brother.

172
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,700
And you're that reporter,
Cindy Campbell.

173
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,020
You did the story
on our cop cycles.

174
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,300
Crop circles.

175
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,820
Right.

176
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,500
So, you're here
to pick up your...

177
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,020
Nephew, Cody.

178
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,860
You don't dress like a farmer.

179
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,380
My brother's the farmer.

180
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,140
I'm the rapper.

181
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,020
- Hmm.
- Oh, for real.

182
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,660
And here's the 6-1-1 on that.

183
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:00,140
That's phone repair.
You mean 4-1-1.

184
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,180
Right.

185
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:04,820
So, I'll be doing the rap battle
at the 23 Club tomorrow night.

186
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,220
Oh, I don't believe this shit.

187
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,020
Word!
You two should come down!

188
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,740
I'll be rappin',
I'll be cappin',

189
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,580
I'll be tappin',
I'll be flappin',

190
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,620
I'll be happen-ing.

191
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,580
Ding, bing, wing.

192
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,500
- Yo!
- Sounds good!

193
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,340
Would, could, should, 'hood.

194
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,100
Gug, mug, dug, bug.

195
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,540
If we say we'll come,
will you shut your ass up?

196
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,820
Okay, then.
Fresh.

197
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,380
I'll see you guys
tomorrow night.

198
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,820
Okay. Bye.

199
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:30,940
Peace out.

200
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,860
Now, who the fuck did that?

201
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:44,780
Honey, what is it?

202
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,180
Are you having
one of your visions?

203
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:49,020
There's a girl...
with black hair.

204
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,420
She wants to kill you.

205
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:55,860
Your period starts
in three... two... one.

206
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:58,340
What else?
Cody, what else do you see?

207
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:01,020
I see a little boy
and a grown woman.

208
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:01,980
But no father.

209
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,220
Oh, Cody.

210
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:05,060
I see you kneeling in dog shit.

211
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:07,300
What?

212
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,780
Oh, for God's sake.

213
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,420
Cody, don't you understand?

214
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:14,380
As long as we have each other,
that's all we need.

215
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,820
I know things have been tough
for you since your mom died.

216
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:21,220
God, I have been so selfish.
Always putting my career first.

217
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,300
From now on, I'm gonna be
thinking about you 24...

218
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:27,060
Damn!

219
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,660
Wait, Cindy!
Wait!

220
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:47,700
Honey, I'm gonna be
leaving soon, so...

221
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,620
Do you know who she is?

222
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,220
No.

223
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,540
But sometimes she talks to me.

224
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,260
She's coming tonight.

225
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,220
Oh, Father Muldoon.

226
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,540
Cindy.

227
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,460
I'm so grateful you could come.

228
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,380
I've called all over
for babysitters.

229
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,420
I don't mind filling in
now and then.

230
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:32,460
Where is little Cody?

231
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,660
I don't know.

232
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,580
He must be back in his room,
playing.

233
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:40,420
Anyway, I left a number where
I can be reached on the table.

234
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:43,100
Also, he has a little rash
on his behind.

235
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,500
So make sure he takes a bath.

236
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,740
Thank you, Father.
Good night.

237
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,780
Cody?

238
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:05,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's getting thick up in here.

239
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,940
Hey, look, before we get on
with the battles tonight,

240
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,620
I got a couple announcements
to make.

241
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,780
I know y'all want to bust a cap
in the air

242
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:12,980
for your favorite rapper.

243
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:16,060
But if you could please hold on
to your gunfire

244
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,020
until the end of the show.

245
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,900
Let's just put the safeties on.

246
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,860
It's on the left side of the gun
above the trigger guard.

247
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:29,060
Will somebody get his ass
out of here?

248
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:32,220
All right.
Deejay, spin that shit!

249
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,540
Whoa!
My bad.

250
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,180
Mother...

251
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:01,340
Brenda, is something wrong?
You look scared.

252
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:04,300
I don't know. All that stuff
you was saying on TV...

253
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:07,180
I just got a weird feeling
something bad is heading my way.

254
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,020
Like when you see
an Asian person

255
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,340
behind the wheel of a car.

256
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:13,900
Cindy, after the show, you think
you could come back to my crib

257
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,180
and hang out with me?

258
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,580
I don't want to be alone.

259
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,500
Oh, of course I will, Brenda.

260
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,780
Oh, I love you.

261
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,940
Pay my way, okay?

262
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,380
Yo, yo, yo, George!

263
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,580
What's up with the man
with the tightest rap game

264
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,980
on the streets, baby?

265
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,660
- What's good with you, boy?
- Dude!

266
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,340
What's good, baby?

267
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:34,060
Finally, the white man is gonna
school the black man

268
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,020
on how to rap.

269
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,140
- Yeah!
- Yeah. Yeah, I guess.

270
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,860
How many people are here,
you think?

271
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:39,820
I don't know, man.

272
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,820
100, 200 whitey-hating,
chrome-packing,

273
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,540
ready to bust a cap
in any white boy's ass

274
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:47,060
- who ain't bringing that shit.
- Yeah. At least. Yeah.

275
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:47,980
Mm-hmm.
Word.

276
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,180
What's wrong, George?

277
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,500
You ever wonder when it's time
to stop living up here

278
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,140
and start living down here?

279
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,900
No, but what if we stop living
over here and move over there?

280
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,900
My Aunt ShaNeequa used to live
over there, man.

281
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,020
But that bitch got evicted.

282
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,700
- Word? What for?
- I'm dead serious.

283
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,900
- Mice.
- Mice? I thought she had rats.

284
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,820
No, man. Rats are outside.
Mice are inside.

285
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,940
What if a mouse goes outside?
Does it become a rat?

286
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,900
If a rat is in the house,
is it a mouse?

287
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,780
I ain't never seen
no mouse outside.

288
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,100
That's because it's a rat, fool!

289
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:17,300
Damn, you might have just made
a fact just now.

290
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,420
Fellas, what are you guys
talking about?

291
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,940
Yo, George, you need something?

292
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,180
'Cause I will do anything
for you.

293
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:24,980
Anything.

294
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,060
Well, about those
chrome-packing,

295
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,780
whitey-hating gangsters,
perhaps...

296
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:32,100
- What he need is a hype man.
- Word!

297
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,020
You can be his Spliff Star.

298
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,180
That's me.
That's what I do.

299
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:38,020
That's my job, baby!
That's what I do!

300
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,460
You know that.
Goddamn.

301
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:41,860
I'm cool.
That's what I do.

302
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:44,940
When you a hype man,
you take them hits.

303
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,540
All right, all right, all right!
That was hot!

304
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,820
That's what I'm talking about.
That was hot, right?

305
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:02,060
Right?
Yo, what do we think?

306
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:07,740
I thought you were both
absolutely dreadful.

307
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:08,780
Ghastly.

308
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:09,740
What?

309
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,740
I don't know
what I'm doing here.

310
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:14,540
This club is totally pathetic.

311
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,540
You ready, George?

312
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,260
- It's showtime, baby.
- Okay.

313
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,300
I just want to let you know
no matter what goes on

314
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,380
on that stage tonight...

315
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,380
you'll always be in my heart.

316
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,420
Oh, that's love.
That's love right there.

317
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,940
- I love you.
- That's what I'm talking about.

318
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,460
I love you, man.
Can you feel it?

319
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,580
Can you feel my love
on your hip?

320
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:46,540
Can you feel it?

321
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,740
I can't get around!

322
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,700
Come on, dawg!
That's what I'm talkin' about!

323
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:52,180
You go out there and you
rip it tonight. All right, man?

324
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,820
You do your thing tonight,
all right?

325
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,540
- Okay. Cool.
- We shouldn't have to do that.

326
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:56,740
We love each other.

327
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:57,820
I'm gonna go bring you on.

328
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,300
Let's do it, baby.
We hyped!

329
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,220
Yeah.
All right, all right.

330
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,860
Y'all ready
for the next throwdown?

331
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,900
To my left, we have
the reigning champion.

332
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,220
Hailing from Fort Apache
in the Bronx.

333
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,540
BX!
What? What? What?

334
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:13,180
Some of y'all call him
"Jealous Ones Still Envy."

335
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,100
Some of y'all call him
the Don Cartagena!

336
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,100
Some of y'all call him
Joey Crack.

337
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:18,900
Stick 'em up!

338
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:22,900
But, tonight, let's give it up
for Fat Joe!

339
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,340
I got to go against him?

340
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,900
Give it up!
Give it up!

341
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,820
What you think,
they're here to see Fat Joe?

342
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,820
Joe! Joe! Joe!

343
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,940
No, man, they're saying,
"Go! Go! Go!"

344
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,900
Now my challenger.

345
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,420
He's a farmer rapper.

346
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:42,340
So you know he been kicking
the shit all day!

347
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,580
Let's give it up
for my man, George!

348
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:47,140
That's what I'm talking about!
Yeah! Yeah!

349
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,940
Come on, everybody!
Put your hands...

350
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:52,380
That's right.
Okay, Joey Crack.

351
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,580
You're the reigning champion,
so you get to spit first.

352
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,380
Yo, deejay, spin that shit!

353
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,340
These guys can't be serious
right here.

354
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:49,620
Okay, let's go!
Wait a minute!

355
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,740
All right!

356
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,460
All right!
That was hot!

357
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,140
That was tight, Fat Joe.
Yo!

358
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:59,220
Now everybody give it up
for my man, George!

359
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,900
Deejay, spin that shit!

360
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,700
Come on! Come on!
Everybody!

361
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:32,980
- Check it out.
- Go! Go! Go!

362
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:12,460
That's what I'm talking about!

363
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:15,980
Give it up for George!

364
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:18,100
That's my boy right there!
That's what...

365
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,740
Oh, shit.

366
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:26,060
George! George!
The hood!

367
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,420
Lose the hood!

368
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,900
- I know. We're in the 'hood now!
- No, man!

369
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,420
He's a dead man.

370
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,980
You guys feeling me?
In the 'hood?

371
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,980
Whoa! Whoa!

372
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,980
That's it.
I'm done.

373
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,380
Oh, man, you can't give up rap
just like that.

374
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,940
Rap shmap.

375
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:49,620
Look! You still got it!
See?

376
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,940
Thanks for coming over
tonight, Cindy.

377
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:55,380
I guess I'm just going through
a rough time.

378
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:59,500
Brenda, you want to tell me
what's really bothering you?

379
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:04,100
Well, there's something
I need to...

380
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,740
I saw a tape.

381
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,860
I think you should know
about it.

382
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:10,740
It had these really
shocking images, Cindy.

383
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:13,220
Brenda, it was Mardi Gras.

384
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:16,300
I never drank vodka before,
and I was out of beads!

385
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,220
No, not that tape, Cindy.

386
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,460
Well, I guess it's just
an urban legend.

387
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,780
You watch it.

388
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:25,140
And as soon as it's over,
your phone rings

389
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,620
and a creepy voice says...

390
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,180
"You're gonna die in seven days."

391
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:32,140
And seven days later...

392
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,580
When did you watch it?

393
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,580
A week ago.

394
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,140
A week ago tonight.

395
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,900
Brenda.

396
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:45,100
Oh, my God!

397
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:47,140
Oh, Brenda!

398
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:50,700
Brenda!
Oh, my God!

399
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,940
Oh, my God!
You bitch!

400
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,460
Ketchup!

401
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,580
You should have seen
the look on your face!

402
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,740
You got me!

403
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:08,700
Brenda? Brenda?

404
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,420
Oh, my God, Brenda!
Brenda?

405
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:22,780
I can't believe you fell
for that fake seizure!

406
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,180
But it seemed so real!

407
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,940
- It did, didn't it?
- And you peed!

408
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,620
Yeah! I really sold
that shit, didn't I?

409
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:32,940
I just love the look on
your face when you are scared!

410
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,500
Girl, you are too easy.

411
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:44,860
I got you
with the old fake hand!

412
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,420
Girl, you were scared!

413
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,820
Well, I know!

414
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,660
Oh, come on.
I was just kidding.

415
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,820
Well, you've taken it
too far, Brenda.

416
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,660
I'm gonna go get
the rest of the popcorn.

417
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:03,980
Cindy?

418
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:06,580
Oh, forget it.
I am not falling for it again.

419
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,900
Oh, come on.

420
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,900
Cindy, the news is on.

421
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,940
Another little white girl
done fell down a well.

422
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:32,500
50 black people get their
ass beat by police today,

423
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,060
but the whole world got to stop

424
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,620
for one little whitey
down a hole.

425
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,220
Cindy!

426
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,620
The TV's leaking!

427
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,100
Cindy?

428
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,540
Cindy, something's wrong here.

429
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:10,140
Cindy, this bitch
is messing up my floor!

430
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:15,340
Cindy, help me!

431
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,860
I'm not listening.

432
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,900
Get up, you little ugly bitch,

433
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,660
Come on!
Let me see what you got!

434
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:25,620
What you gonna do?
That's all?

435
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:31,420
I'm whipping her ass, Cindy!

436
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,700
Yeah!
What's up?

437
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:48,780
Cindy, please help me!

438
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,780
Cindy!

439
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:52,980
Okay.
Hang on a second.

440
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:53,940
Hello?

441
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:56,460
Father Muldoon here.
We're getting along famously.

442
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:58,580
Thanks again, Father.
Bye-bye.

443
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,300
Brenda?

444
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:02,300
Brenda?

445
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,420
Brenda?

446
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,220
Oh, my God.

447
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,820
Yes. Yes.
Of course I'll tell her.

448
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,420
Thank you.

449
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,980
Sue's teacher, Brenda.

450
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:27,940
She's...

451
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:28,900
She's dead.

452
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:31,260
I better tell her.

453
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,540
No, no, no.
I can do it.

454
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,180
Sue?

455
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:42,100
Yes?

456
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:44,380
You know your teacher,
Miss Brenda?

457
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,180
Yeah.

458
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:47,340
She's dead!

459
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:48,620
Gone forever!

460
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,900
Died a horrible, painful death!

461
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,500
Gone, gone, gone,
just like your dog!

462
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:54,780
My dog's dead?

463
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:58,220
I just ran him over with the car
when I drove in!

464
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,820
Everyone you love around you
is dying!

465
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,660
Hello, Father.

466
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,620
Don't call me Father.

467
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:16,060
I haven't been
a clergyman since...

468
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:21,220
I'm sorry about that night.

469
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,980
If I hadn't fallen asleep
while driving

470
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:25,500
for that exact 20 minutes.

471
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:28,980
If I hadn't drank that exact
whole bottle of Jägermeister.

472
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:31,900
If only I hadn't killed
that hooker.

473
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,740
Sayaman.

474
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:35,940
I don't see what any of this
has to do with Annie.

475
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:38,700
I'm sorry.
Those were other nights.

476
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:43,580
But if it had been that night,
I might have missed her.

477
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,980
That terrible night.

478
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:05,980
It's your wife, Father.

479
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,540
She's hurt.

480
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:08,300
Annie?

481
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:11,380
She was hit by a truck,
and she's pinned against a tree.

482
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,460
I don't understand.

483
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:16,380
As long as the truck has her
pinned, she'll stay alive.

484
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:18,140
I still don't get it.

485
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:25,700
This is your wife.

486
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,900
She broke her wiener?

487
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:34,060
Look what happens to the taco.

488
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:38,180
Look, I don't understand
all this fancy medical lingo.

489
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:40,020
I want to see Annie.

490
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:43,060
She's split in half.

491
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:47,620
You mean like down-the-middle
in half?

492
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,740
At the waist.

493
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:53,100
You mean this is the last time
I can talk to the top half?

494
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,500
Yes.

495
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:58,100
The truck is the only thing
that is holding her together.

496
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:01,540
Let's say this is
her bottom half.

497
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:04,300
Can I squeeze in
a few minutes with that?

498
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:07,300
I'm not sure what you mean.

499
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,900
- Let me explain.
- Tom.

500
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,540
Go to her.

501
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:21,900
Tom, I'll need a ride home.

502
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:28,060
Hey, baby.
How's it going?

503
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,300
Oh, I'm dying, Tom.

504
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:32,420
Don't talk like that.

505
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:35,060
The truck barely hit you.

506
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,140
Honey.

507
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:39,660
Kiss me one last time.

508
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:45,340
Promise me you'll never remarry.

509
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:47,700
I promise.

510
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:50,100
And no sex, either.

511
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:52,900
I'm sorry.
I didn't catch that.

512
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,260
No sex.

513
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:56,380
Honey, you're not
speaking clearly.

514
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,180
- Your injuries must be awful.
- No sex.

515
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:01,740
Oh, cruel fate to shroud my
wife's dying words in mystery.

516
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:03,660
- No sex!
- Poor Annie.

517
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:04,780
We hardly knew her.

518
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,940
- She'll be missed terribly.
- Oh, Jesus.

519
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:09,060
That's right, honey.
Go into the light.

520
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,180
Look!

521
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:12,900
Just tell George, swing away.

522
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,700
Right.
Swing away.

523
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:17,300
Oh, sure.
That you understand.

524
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,740
Annie?
Annie!

525
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,300
I'm sorry, dude.

526
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,900
Don't call me dude.

527
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:29,300
I'm not a stoner anymore.
Not since...

528
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,980
Goodbye, Tom.

529
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,820
I'm so sorry,
Mr. And Mrs. Meeks.

530
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:53,620
Brenda was a good friend
when she was alive.

531
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:55,740
My sweet, sweet Brenda.

532
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,940
She looks so peaceful.

533
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:05,780
If only God had taken us
instead of our daughter.

534
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,220
And knowing your Brenda
like I did,

535
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,700
I'd say she wishes
the same thing.

536
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,860
These just came today.

537
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:16,540
Photos from a trip she took.

538
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:20,780
They're blank.

539
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,300
Turn them around, honey.

540
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,780
Yes, of course.

541
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:27,940
Who's this?

542
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:30,900
That's Ralph.
He's right over there.

543
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:37,620
Cody?

544
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:41,220
It's a boy.
He's going to be an asshole.

545
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:44,580
Smoke all you want.
You're gonna get hit by a bus.

546
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:47,500
That's not fooling anyone.

547
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,180
Cindy.

548
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,500
- George.
- Hey.

549
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:54,220
Sue wanted to pay her respects
to her teacher.

550
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,140
You?

551
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:57,500
Brenda was my bitch.

552
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,540
Of course.

553
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,500
Hmm.

554
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:02,660
Are you okay?

555
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:05,180
It's just the open coffin.

556
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:07,180
I can't believe they leave it
out here like this.

557
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,180
- George, it's a wake!
- Awake?!

558
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,340
- Brenda! It's a miracle!
- No! George, stop!

559
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,660
I thought you were dead!

560
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:15,820
Sue, your teacher's alive!
Hello?!

561
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:19,020
I got your back, George!
I got your back!

562
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:19,940
She's alive!

563
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,460
I'll tell you what!

564
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,540
Mahalik!
She's alive! Brenda!

565
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,140
George, stop!
She's dead!

566
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,780
No!
We won't lose you again!

567
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:32,100
Mahalik, help!

568
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,220
Nothing!

569
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,740
She's not breathing!

570
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:38,620
No!

571
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,700
Live, damn it!
Live!

572
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,700
Live, damn it!
Live!

573
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,580
Let me open her windpipe!

574
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,620
No! Oh, God!

575
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,020
Charles!
Charles, stop them!

576
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,820
Breathe!

577
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:56,460
Someone stop them!
What are they doing?!

578
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:58,060
Get up!

579
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,140
She's alive!
She's alive!

580
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:02,900
Wake up!
Breathe!

581
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:14,340
- Charles! Charles!
- Clear!

582
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:16,340
No!

583
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:22,580
I got something!
I got something!

584
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:31,020
- That's it!
- George!

585
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,820
That's the last time I try to
bring anyone back from the dead.

586
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,940
George, don't get down
on yourself.

587
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,860
I know you were only trying
to help.

588
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:40,820
You're a good, caring person.

589
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:43,060
Which is why I like you.

590
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,380
Oh, thanks, Cindy.

591
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,580
But I don't want to
screw your life up, too.

592
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:48,500
The most caring thing I could do
for everyone right now

593
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,060
is to just get out of here.

594
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:53,020
George!
What about Sue?

595
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:55,700
Oh, yes.
Of course.

596
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,660
Once I get Sue, then...

597
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:58,900
Wait!

598
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:03,500
I could really use a friend
right now.

599
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:09,540
Brenda's gone.
Cody resents me.

600
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:13,380
And I'm caught up in something
I can't even...

601
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,580
Oh, God, it's so hard!

602
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:19,940
Well, you're beautiful and
you're pressing up against me.

603
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:23,740
Look, Cindy.

604
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:26,580
I know you'd never consider
going out with a guy like me.

605
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:30,740
But if you're not too busy
tomorrow night...

606
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:34,820
Is that a yes?

607
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,180
Yes.

608
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:45,100
Cindy, did Brenda
ever talk to you about a tape?

609
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:46,940
She did mention something.

610
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:49,140
Do you mind if I go upstairs
and look around?

611
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,380
Yes, go.
Of course. Go.

612
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:53,980
Cody, I'll be right back, okay?

613
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:56,540
You're getting lucky tonight.

614
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:58,980
He doesn't know you're a guy.

615
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,860
Oh, shit.

616
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:37,020
Hello?

617
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:40,900
What?
Willie Mays?

618
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,220
Who's gay?
Hello?

619
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:46,900
What?

620
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:48,380
Can you hear me now?

621
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:49,540
Kind of.

622
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:51,460
- Can you hear me now?
- Yes. Perfect.

623
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,660
Seven days.

624
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:54,140
Seven days.

625
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:56,060
Oh, my God.
I'm gonna die next Monday?

626
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:57,380
Yes.
No. Wait.

627
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,580
Monday. That would be
seven business days.

628
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,500
This is seven days starting now.

629
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:04,220
So seven days to this very hour?
My watch broke.

630
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,580
How am I gonna know
the exact hour?

631
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:08,140
Forget hours.
This day seven days from now.

632
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:10,860
But there's a holiday coming up.
Do you count the holiday?

633
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,780
Well, that depends.
What holiday?

634
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:14,700
- Martin Luther King Day.
- Then no.

635
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:16,940
Why not? Everybody at work
is taking it off.

636
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:19,180
Jesus Christ, lady. I'm giving
you seven friggin' days.

637
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,700
I can come over now and kill the
shit out of you if you'd rather.

638
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,860
Yo, George, I don't care
what you say, man.

639
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:29,780
I'm signing you up
for another rap battle.

640
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:32,140
Mahalik, I told you.
That part of my life is over.

641
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:34,380
I said the same thing about
getting with CJ's sister.

642
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,980
- I'm still hitting that.
- He's still hitting it, man!

643
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:39,220
And she fine as shit!
That's my sister! What?

644
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,540
It doesn't matter.
I'm done.

645
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:43,060
- So what are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

646
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:47,620
A-come on!

647
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:50,620
Maybe my brother was right.
Maybe I should just settle down.

648
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:54,060
- What's up, then?!
- Mother...

649
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,220
I got another one, y'all.

650
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:58,620
Yo, George, man, you can't focus
on that shit, man.

651
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:00,740
Let that go.

652
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:03,740
Hey, you got to try
this shit, George.

653
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,140
Yo, man, you got to take
the lid off!

654
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:11,540
- Oh, yes. Of course.
- Sorry!

655
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:13,860
Hello?

656
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:16,660
George, something
terrible has happened!

657
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:20,380
Cindy, are you okay?
What's going on?

658
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:22,300
George, you have to help me.

659
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:24,780
I just watched the same tape
that killed Brenda.

660
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:28,180
Then the phone rang, and this
voice said I was gonna die.

661
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:30,660
Cindy, there's no such thing
as a killer videotape.

662
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:32,180
Hell, yeah, there is!

663
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,860
I know somebody who can
help you.

664
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,500
- You do? Who?
- Wait up, man.

665
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:38,460
I heard Jamal from 90th street
watched that tape last week.

666
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,780
This morning he woke up dead.

667
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,500
How in the hell
do you wake up dead?

668
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:43,420
'Cause you're alive
when you go to sleep.

669
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:46,220
You're telling me you can go
to bed dead and wake up alive?

670
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,820
You can't go to bed dead!

671
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:50,060
- That shit would be redundant.
- No, it wouldn't.

672
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:52,180
'Cause you can go to bed
and not be dead.

673
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:53,900
And you can die
but not be in a bed.

674
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,140
But you are in a bed, man.

675
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:57,460
That's how you wake up dead
in the first place!

676
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:00,340
Damn! That's some quantum shit
right there, man!

677
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:02,540
You should be teaching classes!

678
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:04,740
- Just tell me who can help me!
- Damn!

679
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:05,700
My Aunt ShaNeequa.

680
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,580
Her and her man
into this weird shit.

681
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:10,140
They saw the tape before anybody
else knew about it.

682
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:13,020
- Go see them tonight.
- Tonight? Yeah.

683
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:15,260
But who will take care of Cody?

684
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:18,580
George,
we're gonna have so much fun.

685
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:20,500
I have some puzzles
and board games

686
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:22,140
and baseball cards in my room

687
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,660
and this really cool
model airplane.

688
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:25,140
- I'm gonna go get it.
- Sure.

689
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:26,660
Okay, so I made him a snack.

690
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:29,340
You can give him some warm milk
if he can't go to sleep.

691
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:31,060
- Everything's gonna be fine.
- Here it is.

692
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:33,580
I'm great with kids.
Heads up, Cody.

693
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:38,180
- Oh, I left some numbers.
- I'm okay.

694
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,580
Sorry.
You okay, kiddo?

695
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,620
Thataboy.

696
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:48,340
And I guess that's it.

697
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:51,180
- Okay, I'm off.
- Right.

698
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:52,540
You know, it's funny.

699
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:56,420
All a child ever really wants
is a family.

700
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,700
Yo.

701
00:39:58,460 --> 00:39:59,780
Cody really likes you.

702
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,100
Oh, he's a good kid.

703
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:02,580
Yeah.

704
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:06,900
- Bye.
- Bye.

705
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:23,300
Hello?

706
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:24,740
I know.

707
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:27,540
You're Cindy.
Be right with you.

708
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,220
Aunt ShaNeequa?

709
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,660
Bingo.

710
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:33,500
But you can call me
the Oracle.

711
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:35,060
And don't worry about that vase.

712
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,540
What vase?
Sorry. I didn't know.

713
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:42,020
That vase.

714
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:44,940
Please, sit.

715
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:52,260
It was the chair.

716
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:00,020
Yes, the chair.

717
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,500
I know why you've come.

718
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:05,220
A great mystery
lies ahead of you,

719
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,900
but you must not shy away
from the challenge.

720
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:10,180
Only you can be the one...

721
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,260
- Orpheus?
- What, baby?

722
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:15,060
Sweetie?

723
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:16,980
I'm watching the game.

724
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:19,780
Do you mind?

725
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:24,140
The Lakers will win by 12.

726
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:28,740
- So can you tell me about...
- The tape?

727
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:32,220
- Yes. I watched it and...
- The phone rang.

728
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:35,940
- Right. Then this voice said...
- That you would die.

729
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,340
- Okay, that's getting...
- Extremely annoying.

730
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:39,340
Yeah.

731
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:41,020
Try being married to her.

732
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:44,580
I catch shit about women
I ain't slept with yet.

733
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:47,580
You made a copy of the tape.
Let's see it.

734
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:49,380
Yes. Okay.

735
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:56,940
ShaNeequa, can you tell me if...

736
00:41:56,940 --> 00:42:00,780
The tape is connected to the
crop circles and the aliens?

737
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:04,620
Yes. But it's up to you
to discover how for yourself.

738
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:05,780
Look, it's a...

739
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,620
Cigarette?

740
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:10,300
I was going to say lighthouse.

741
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:13,980
Find that lighthouse.
It's your destiny.

742
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:16,860
Wait.

743
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:18,700
What is that?

744
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:24,860
Oh, my God.

745
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:45,100
There we go.

746
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,260
Now, baby.

747
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:50,860
I knew that was gonna happen.

748
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:52,900
Come on.

749
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:55,540
Oh, hell, no.

750
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:58,820
Get your ass out of the TV!
What's wrong with you?

751
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:00,580
I'm gonna teach you!

752
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:01,940
Get out of that TV!

753
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:04,300
Baby, no! No!
Let her go! Let her go!

754
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:06,620
Let her go!
We gonna get another lawsuit.

755
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:08,620
She spit on me.
I'm gonna kill the bitch.

756
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:11,020
You won.
You won.

757
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:12,620
You won.
You won.

758
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:14,100
- Upstairs.
- Okay.

759
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:15,260
- Down low.
- Okay.

760
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:16,780
- All right.
- Baby, no!

761
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:19,860
- Kill her! Is you crazy?
- Baby!

762
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:22,220
What you gonna brush now?

763
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:23,700
What you gonna brush now, huh?

764
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:24,780
Come on, baby!

765
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:27,620
You picked the wrong TV
to come out of.

766
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:34,780
George?
Cody?

767
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:38,940
George?

768
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:41,060
What happened?

769
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:42,620
I don't know.

770
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,740
Cody and I were playing
a fun game,

771
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:46,300
and then I looked down.

772
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:48,460
Yahtzee!

773
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:56,540
No!

774
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:59,220
Oh, my God!

775
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:01,140
How could you let him
watch the tape?

776
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:11,260
Hello?

777
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:14,980
- It's me. How you doing?
- Fine.

778
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:17,860
Enjoying your last week?
I can't wait to see you.

779
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:20,860
- Six days now, right?
- Yeah.

780
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:23,260
It was great catching up.
Can I speak to Cody?

781
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:25,540
Why?
He didn't watch the tape.

782
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:28,420
Yes, he did. Come on, Cindy,
I do this for a living.

783
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:30,340
Leave us alone!

784
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:36,020
Hello?

785
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:37,780
Hello, I'm calling
from "Reader's Digest"

786
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:39,380
with a fantastic offer
for Cody.

787
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:43,900
No, you're not! You're that evil
little girl from the tape!

788
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:45,700
Okay, you got me.

789
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:47,540
How about I just leave
a message for him?

790
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:49,180
Fine.

791
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:55,340
Yeah. Okay, how do you
spell that?

792
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:56,300
Right.

793
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:59,420
Okay, got it.
Bye-bye.

794
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:06,580
I can't believe
you let that happen.

795
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:08,020
I know. I'm sorry.
I screwed up.

796
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:10,020
Listen, we can still save him.

797
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:12,060
The answer to the tape,
to your crop circles,

798
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:13,660
is at a lighthouse.

799
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:15,500
Oh, you think I'm crazy,
don't you?

800
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:16,460
Of course I do.

801
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:19,540
But the last thing you need now
is a screw-up like me.

802
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:21,260
I'm gonna leave for good.

803
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:22,500
Wait.

804
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:27,780
Well, what should I tell Cody?

805
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:28,860
Let him down easy.

806
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:30,860
Tell him I got called away
on business.

807
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:32,580
You'll think of something.

808
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:35,180
Testicular cancer.
He won't ask questions.

809
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:36,940
I knew you'd understand.

810
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:38,340
George!

811
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:39,700
Just...

812
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:41,500
be careful.

813
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:44,020
Something weird is going on
at your farm. I know it.

814
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:45,260
I don't know.

815
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:47,580
Sometimes a sheep needs
pushed through the fence.

816
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:49,780
- What?
- Goodbye, Cindy.

817
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:16,540
- Sue?
- I can't sleep.

818
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:19,660
Well, it's way past
your bedtime.

819
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:25,420
Won't you rock me to sleep
in your big, strong arms?

820
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:29,820
There's plenty of room
under the covers.

821
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:31,860
It's a hot night.

822
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:34,260
You don't need to wear pajamas.

823
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:37,100
Where is my daughter?

824
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:39,540
Are you mad?
I am your daughter.

825
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:41,180
No, you're not!

826
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:46,100
Come here!
What did you do with Sue?

827
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:47,620
I didn't touch her.
I swear.

828
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:48,820
I don't believe you!

829
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:51,220
Please! For God's sake,
she's a girl!

830
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:53,100
You sick...

831
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:14,100
Daddy!

832
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:16,220
How do you like it, huh?

833
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:18,260
Having fun?

834
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:36,420
Tom, are you...

835
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:38,620
What in the world?

836
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:39,860
Shh!

837
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:43,500
Look.

838
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:45,420
What is that thing?

839
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:47,420
I don't know.

840
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:50,260
Maybe Cindy was right.

841
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:07,220
Please, sir.
All I need is five minutes.

842
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:10,500
And I told you, Campbell,
no more paranoid on-air rants

843
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:12,980
- about the supernatural.
- I know.

844
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:15,380
This station is about sex,
violence, and the weather.

845
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:16,980
Yes.
That reminds me.

846
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:19,900
We're gonna need that "Porn Star
Shot Dead in a Hurricane" story.

847
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:21,420
One hour.

848
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:23,820
Meanwhile,
a tornado in Charleston

849
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:26,420
threatens a clothing-optional
beach where just yesterday

850
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:28,740
a naked couple
was brutally murdered.

851
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:31,500
This just five miles
from where the last naked couple

852
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:32,900
was brutally murdered.

853
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:34,700
Turning now to sports.

854
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:36,740
And an evil videotape

855
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:39,820
that kills anyone
who watches it in seven days.

856
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:42,180
It's true.
We're all in danger.

857
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:43,820
- There's an alien force
- Oh, no.

858
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:46,100
That's trying prevent you
from knowing the truth.

859
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:47,260
Campbell, are you insane?

860
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:48,340
It's a horrible fate.

861
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:49,580
Carson, I have to do this.

862
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:51,620
Correction,
there really is no danger.

863
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:54,300
Actually, I didn't really mean
anything I just said.

864
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:56,700
Yes, I did.
Every word of it.

865
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:59,100
Everyone watching this
could be dead in a week.

866
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:00,620
Oh, shizl gzngahr.

867
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:13,020
469. I been cleaning after
this dumb-ass cracker Giggins

868
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:14,060
for 10 years.

869
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:16,700
But I been hitting it
with his woman for 12.

870
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:18,340
Know what I'm saying, nigga?

871
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:19,900
She likes her some chocolate.

872
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:22,820
Sharpton for president, y'all.
I'm outie.

873
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:24,380
Peace.

874
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:27,820
An evil videotape
that kills people in 7 days.

875
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:29,540
Alien forces
threatening the world.

876
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:31,460
And who the hell
is this Cindy Campbell?

877
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:34,260
If what she says is true, we're
facing an unprecedented crisis.

878
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:35,300
Get me the president.

879
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:36,420
You are the president.

880
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:38,860
Good. Then I already know
about this.

881
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:40,020
Let's order lunch.

882
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:42,500
Sir, I think you need
to go on TV

883
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:46,140
and convince the people that
there is no such thing as a UFO.

884
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:48,060
Don't spell in front of me,
damn it.

885
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:49,380
Aliens, sir.

886
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:51,380
There's no such thing
as aliens.

887
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:53,340
- That's not quite true.
- Sir?

888
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:56,300
A year ago, a UFO crash-landed
in New Mexico.

889
00:49:56,340 --> 00:49:59,220
- A body may have been recovered.
- "May have been"?

890
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:01,900
Well, there was
a terrible mix-up.

891
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:03,700
It was Thanksgiving.

892
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:06,100
The body was sent down
to the kitchen.

893
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:09,860
They shoved stuffing up its ass,
and we ate it at a state dinner.

894
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:11,500
That's the last I saw of it.

895
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:12,860
No, scratch that.

896
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:14,860
There were some sandwiches
made the next day.

897
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:16,020
Mr. President!

898
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:17,660
- Listen to me.
- Agent Thompson!

899
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:18,980
Back away from that window!

900
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:21,300
What? Did I forget
to put my pants on again?

901
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:23,620
No, sir. It's just a feeling
I've been having

902
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:25,220
since the news about the aliens.

903
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:27,380
- Something's not right.
- I know what you mean.

904
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:30,460
It's like that feeling
that something's not right.

905
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,300
What is it?

906
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:35,460
Some old Tupac, sir.

907
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:41,980
"All eyez on me."
Hey, this shit is banging.

908
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:44,420
Thank you, sir.
I appreciate it.

909
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:57,420
Hello, Cindy.

910
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:02,060
I am the Architect.

911
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:03,420
You have many questions.

912
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:08,900
I've been watching you
for a very long time.

913
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:11,660
So I see.

914
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:14,580
What is the connection between
the crop circles and the tape?

915
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:15,700
The answer is simple.

916
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:18,060
You are the eventuality
of an anomaly.

917
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:20,580
You are inexorably seeking
a sedulant probability.

918
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:21,620
Sedulant?

919
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:23,380
Grotesquerie?
No?

920
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:25,460
What about
contingent affirmation?

921
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:27,340
- That's got to mean something.
- Hey!

922
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:31,260
Hey!
You put cameras in my bathroom?

923
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:34,620
What is this?

924
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:38,140
Oh, my God.
Well, it was a long winter.

925
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:39,420
This is an invasion of...

926
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:40,780
Oh, sorry.

927
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:43,140
I can't help it.
It's very lonely in here.

928
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:46,540
Ergo, I haven't been with anyone
in a very long time,

929
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:48,140
not counting myself.

930
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:50,580
Or this chair.

931
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:52,860
I call her...

932
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:54,100
Linda.

933
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:56,500
Could you just cut to the chase?
I'm kind of in a rush.

934
00:52:56,580 --> 00:52:58,740
Why? You can always sleep over
if you want.

935
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:00,820
Linda's built for two,
and she vibrates.

936
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:02,860
Stop it! Just tell me
what I need to know.

937
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:04,220
Who is that little girl?

938
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:06,140
Okay, okay.

939
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:11,060
My wife and I wanted a child,
but she couldn't get pregnant.

940
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:12,860
Neither could I.

941
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:14,020
So you adopted.

942
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:16,460
We loved our daughter,
but she was evil.

943
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:18,820
Made the horses crazy,
killed our puppies,

944
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:19,860
hid the remote.

945
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:21,100
Really sick shit.

946
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:22,940
My wife took her
to the old family farm

947
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:24,820
and drowned her in the well.

948
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:28,100
I felt a simple time-out
would have been sufficient.

949
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:31,540
But Tabitha imprinted her evil
on a videotape.

950
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:33,700
I never meant for it
to get out, but...

951
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:35,260
But what?

952
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:37,820
I put it in the wrong box
and returned it to Blockbuster,

953
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:39,620
instead of my copy
of "Pootie Tang."

954
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:42,540
It's been circulating
and killing ever since.

955
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:44,460
Just like "Pootie Tang."

956
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:47,220
But what does this
have to do with aliens?

957
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:48,300
I don't know.

958
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:50,980
Perhaps Tabitha's summoning them
to kill us all.

959
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:53,460
An alien invasion?

960
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:54,860
I have to warn the world.

961
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:57,700
It's already begun.
You're too late.

962
00:53:57,780 --> 00:53:59,420
Oh, my God.

963
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:02,580
But not too late
to make an old man happy.

964
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:05,500
What?

965
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:08,180
And now reports of lights
in the sky.

966
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:10,380
Glimpses of spacecraft.

967
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:14,420
Possible alien sightings being
reported all over the world.

968
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:15,620
Are they aliens?

969
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:17,980
The first video images
are coming in.

970
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:19,820
Disturbing home video tonight

971
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:22,180
from a ranch
outside Sydney, Australia.

972
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:24,500
Watch very carefully now.

973
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:25,660
There it is.

974
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:26,980
Let's see that again.

975
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:30,140
Very, very disturbing.

976
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:33,420
And this just in
from Sao Paulo, Brazil.

977
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:37,580
Let's see that again.

978
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:45,500
Very, very disturbing.

979
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:48,140
And this just in
from South Texas.

980
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:53,900
Do they pose a threat?

981
00:54:54,020 --> 00:54:55,540
Only one thing's for certain.

982
00:54:55,620 --> 00:54:58,380
We are all going to be killed.

983
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:00,220
We have to board up the house.

984
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:02,220
Are you sure
this is necessary, Wilson?

985
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:04,460
Having an awards ceremony
at a time like this?

986
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:07,620
Yes, sir. Everything must
appear business as usual.

987
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:10,540
The nation, while not yet
panicked, is deeply disturbed.

988
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:12,300
Right.
We can steer that course,

989
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:14,060
keeping everybody
deeply disturbed.

990
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:15,300
We don't want a panic.

991
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:17,700
Very few presidents have faced
a crisis like this.

992
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:20,580
I wonder what President Ford
would've done.

993
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:22,420
Well, if the buck stops here...

994
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:24,340
the buck stops here.

995
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:29,220
Thank you all,
and welcome to the White House.

996
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:31,820
The Mother Teresa Awards

997
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:33,860
recognize those
who have overcome

998
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:36,140
the severest handicaps
and disadvantages

999
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:38,860
to help others
in their communities.

1000
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:41,540
The young, the old.
Black and white.

1001
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:44,020
Our Native American friends.
Hey, how are you?

1002
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:46,700
Hey, how are you?
Hey, how are you?

1003
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:47,940
Hey, how are you?

1004
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:51,220
Well, it is therefore my honor

1005
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:55,940
to present each and every one of
you with this symbol of merit.

1006
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:02,860
The room is secure,
Mr. President.

1007
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:04,980
- Or is it?
- Sir?

1008
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:06,380
I've been thinking, Thompson.

1009
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:08,820
What if the aliens could
take over human bodies?

1010
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:10,220
They'd look just like us.

1011
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:11,580
Or almost.

1012
00:56:11,620 --> 00:56:12,980
I never thought of that, sir.

1013
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:15,220
We should be on alert
for anything suspicious.

1014
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:16,620
They could be anywhere.

1015
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:17,820
Even...

1016
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:18,980
Right here.

1017
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:20,140
My God.

1018
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:21,980
We'd never see
the attack coming.

1019
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:25,380
- It's frightening, sir!
- Don't panic.

1020
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:28,660
We'll just move slowly
toward the exit.

1021
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:32,220
At last we meet, Mr. President.

1022
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:33,740
It's happening.
I knew it.

1023
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:35,140
You'll never take me alive!

1024
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:38,500
She's scrambling my brain!

1025
00:56:38,580 --> 00:56:39,820
I'll get her!

1026
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:45,420
Oh, no, you don't!
Not on my watch!

1027
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:47,100
Good work, sir!

1028
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:50,940
Good God!
The small ones have metal teeth!

1029
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:53,380
Jerry's kids, my ass!

1030
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:55,940
Mr. President!

1031
00:56:56,060 --> 00:56:58,860
Mr. President, have you gone
completely insane?

1032
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:00,380
Like a fox.

1033
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:02,460
We got to talk to the person
who saw this coming,

1034
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:03,620
Cindy Campbell.

1035
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:05,300
She knows how
to defeat the aliens.

1036
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:07,380
Filthy, rotten scum!

1037
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:09,140
You're hideous!

1038
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:10,380
Get off my planet!

1039
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:13,060
- No!
- Is everything all right?

1040
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:14,380
The exits are all blocked.

1041
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:15,940
I'll find one, sir.

1042
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:18,060
Everybody, clear!

1043
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:22,820
This way, sir!
God, this is exciting!

1044
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:25,740
You're excited?
You should feel my nipples.

1045
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:27,460
Cody?

1046
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:30,540
Cody?
Cody, where are you?

1047
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:31,580
Honey?

1048
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:33,900
After today's incident
in the East Room,

1049
00:57:33,980 --> 00:57:36,380
the White House
is now advising all citizens

1050
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:40,060
to board up their homes and
prepare for an alien invasion.

1051
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:41,980
Oh, no.

1052
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:44,340
And now a News 8 exclusive.

1053
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:46,660
The killer videotape
you've been hearing about.

1054
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:48,300
We're the only station
that has it,

1055
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:49,980
and we're showing it all night.

1056
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:51,940
Very exciting.
Let's roll it again.

1057
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:58,300
There. Nobody's getting
through that sucker.

1058
00:57:58,420 --> 00:58:00,620
But we have to get down
to the cellar.

1059
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,940
- George.
- Cindy.

1060
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:05,420
There's no time.

1061
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:06,740
Cody.

1062
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:08,780
Thank God.
I've been worried sick.

1063
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:11,260
He showed up about an hour ago.
I tried to call.

1064
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:12,900
No, he didn't.

1065
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:14,940
Okay, but I was gonna.

1066
00:58:15,020 --> 00:58:16,740
No, he wasn't.

1067
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:20,100
Cody, the point is you can't
just run away like that.

1068
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:22,020
I wanted to be with George.

1069
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:24,700
Oh, honey, I know
you want a dad, but...

1070
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:27,700
Oh, trust me, Cody,
I'm not good at anything.

1071
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:29,140
Why would I be good at that?

1072
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:31,340
Uncle George!

1073
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:45,540
It's gonna be okay, Cody.

1074
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:47,980
I'm going to die, aren't I?

1075
00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:50,660
Cody, did I ever tell you
what your mom said

1076
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:52,740
about you
the day you were born?

1077
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:53,820
No.

1078
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:56,180
I was in the delivery room
with her.

1079
00:58:56,220 --> 00:58:57,980
She was having a hard time.

1080
00:58:58,020 --> 00:58:59,660
Then you began
to come out of her.

1081
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:02,740
And your mom screamed
and screamed in pain.

1082
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:04,500
She yelled, "Just kill me.

1083
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:06,100
Bludgeon me with a bedpan.

1084
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:08,780
Whatever you do,
put me out of this pain."

1085
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:10,900
She was gushing
torrents of blood.

1086
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:13,580
I have this all on tape
if you want to see it someday.

1087
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:15,500
Well, finally you came out.

1088
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:18,340
Your mom cut
your umbilical cord herself.

1089
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:21,180
Well, on the second try.

1090
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:23,860
The first time she snipped
your penis in half.

1091
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:25,380
After all, she was drunk.

1092
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:26,860
Actually, drugged.

1093
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:29,860
We'd been out the night before
celebrating St. Patrick's Day.

1094
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:32,020
She thought, "Hey,
I never tasted crystal meth."

1095
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:33,940
So she did just a little.

1096
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:35,100
My penis?

1097
00:59:35,220 --> 00:59:36,020
Yes.

1098
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:38,460
They sewed it on upside down.

1099
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:40,220
So that's why I pee up?

1100
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:41,660
Yes.
We'll get it fixed, honey.

1101
00:59:41,740 --> 00:59:44,540
It's on my list of things.
Right after we get TiVo.

1102
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:46,380
Anyway, there you were.

1103
00:59:46,460 --> 00:59:47,900
Your mom turned to me and said,

1104
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:50,860
"Hey, you want him?
Take him."

1105
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:52,580
Then she died.

1106
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:54,060
And I took you.

1107
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:56,220
Do you know why?

1108
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:57,900
I had just lost my cat
in a fire,

1109
00:59:57,980 --> 00:59:59,700
and I needed something
to pet and feed.

1110
00:59:59,820 --> 01:00:02,500
And I miss that cat, Cody.

1111
01:00:02,580 --> 01:00:04,060
But I love you.

1112
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:06,100
And nothing's
ever gonna change that,

1113
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:08,740
not even the very painful death
we're about to experience.

1114
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:10,260
George!

1115
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:19,180
Are they gone?

1116
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:20,340
I don't hear anything.

1117
01:00:28,140 --> 01:00:29,380
Don't worry, Sue.

1118
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:30,620
It was Uncle George.

1119
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:33,220
Well, it's scary.

1120
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:36,740
Good work, Sue.

1121
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:39,020
I don't know what stupid,
idiotic thing

1122
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:40,980
made these lights go off.

1123
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:43,500
All right, there's spare fuses
in the crawl space.

1124
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:44,900
I can get these lights back on.

1125
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:48,700
Quick, George,
grab that railroad tie.

1126
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:50,300
Jam it against the door.

1127
01:00:52,060 --> 01:00:54,140
My balls!

1128
01:00:54,140 --> 01:00:56,180
Not those!

1129
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:57,820
Jesus!

1130
01:00:57,900 --> 01:00:59,140
No!

1131
01:01:00,220 --> 01:01:01,060
Uncle George!

1132
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:02,420
I'm scared!

1133
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:05,220
Oh, sweetie, come here.
It's okay.

1134
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:09,900
There's something
on the other side of the door.

1135
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:24,700
I can't see anything.

1136
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:40,940
Oh, my God.

1137
01:01:41,020 --> 01:01:42,380
Can you see them?

1138
01:01:42,460 --> 01:01:44,100
They're horrible.

1139
01:01:44,180 --> 01:01:46,220
They're grayish
with big black eyes.

1140
01:01:46,220 --> 01:01:47,940
Their teeth are grotesque.

1141
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:52,780
- I think they're giggling.
- What?

1142
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:54,460
Oh, no.

1143
01:01:54,580 --> 01:01:56,860
Oh, no, I think...

1144
01:01:56,980 --> 01:01:59,460
I think they want...

1145
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:02,540
Help!

1146
01:02:02,620 --> 01:02:04,180
Cody!
Oh, my God!

1147
01:02:04,300 --> 01:02:06,500
George.
Swing away, George.

1148
01:02:06,580 --> 01:02:08,420
- Aunt Cindy, help!
- I'm coming, Cody.

1149
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:09,540
I'll save you.

1150
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:11,300
Die!

1151
01:02:14,340 --> 01:02:15,220
Die!

1152
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:17,340
You damn aliens, let him go!

1153
01:02:17,420 --> 01:02:18,980
You're not getting in here!

1154
01:02:19,060 --> 01:02:20,900
- What else you got?
- George.

1155
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:22,900
There!
Had enough?

1156
01:02:23,020 --> 01:02:25,500
Yeah. Forget it, Cody.
Thank me later.

1157
01:02:25,580 --> 01:02:27,340
Oh, Cody.
Oh, thank God.

1158
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:28,260
Come on.

1159
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:29,340
Daddy!

1160
01:02:29,420 --> 01:02:30,700
- Daddy!
- Sue!

1161
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:36,940
Mahalik,
what are you doing here?

1162
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:39,020
I told you the hood's
always got your back.

1163
01:02:39,140 --> 01:02:42,020
Thank God.
There's two of them at the door.

1164
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:42,980
They're gone.

1165
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:46,260
Good.
They couldn't get in.

1166
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:47,700
I hear they can't open doors.

1167
01:02:47,780 --> 01:02:49,380
They mastered space flight,

1168
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:51,420
but they can't get
through a wooden door?

1169
01:02:51,460 --> 01:02:53,340
Oh, look, the cellar's
the safest place.

1170
01:02:53,380 --> 01:02:55,140
Women and children stay here.

1171
01:02:55,260 --> 01:02:57,180
All right, and the men,

1172
01:02:57,300 --> 01:02:58,620
we go outside and fight.

1173
01:02:58,620 --> 01:03:01,220
Right. And what's
the cutoff age for children?

1174
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:02,700
Come on!

1175
01:03:16,420 --> 01:03:18,700
Follow me.

1176
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:32,340
I'm sorry.

1177
01:03:32,420 --> 01:03:34,740
I thought
I was hitting the brake.

1178
01:03:34,740 --> 01:03:37,660
Now, we don't have to go
through insurance, do we?

1179
01:03:37,660 --> 01:03:39,660
Mr. President,
what are you doing here?

1180
01:03:39,740 --> 01:03:41,060
I'm looking for Cindy Campbell.

1181
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:43,500
She may hold the key
to defeating the aliens.

1182
01:03:43,580 --> 01:03:47,540
Good. The Air Force is here
with those new round planes.

1183
01:03:48,660 --> 01:03:51,380
We don't have round planes, sir.

1184
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:54,420
Oh, my God.

1185
01:03:54,540 --> 01:03:57,500
Wait. Do you hear that?

1186
01:04:06,740 --> 01:04:08,780
- Yo, what's up, George?
- CJ!

1187
01:04:08,860 --> 01:04:11,380
I told you the 'hood
always got your back.

1188
01:04:11,420 --> 01:04:13,900
I got the boys with me.
Get out the car, man.

1189
01:04:13,940 --> 01:04:14,980
Who we gonna shoot?

1190
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:16,300
Is y'all ready to go step?

1191
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:18,660
Let's go do this,
'cause I'm hyped right now!

1192
01:04:18,740 --> 01:04:20,820
- Real hyped!
- You stepped on my shoe, bitch!

1193
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:21,980
Call me "bitch" again,

1194
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:24,900
and I'll park your truck
dead in your ass.

1195
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:25,700
Damn, homey!

1196
01:04:25,740 --> 01:04:28,020
- In the cornfield.
- They're coming!

1197
01:04:28,060 --> 01:04:30,180
Me and my boys,
we gonna take care of this.

1198
01:04:30,220 --> 01:04:31,580
Come on, let's go.

1199
01:04:31,700 --> 01:04:33,580
Son, I'd bust
this shit right now.

1200
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:35,340
- Your mama!
- I got your number, homey.

1201
01:04:35,420 --> 01:04:37,460
- We over here, y'all!
- He ain't gonna bust nothing.

1202
01:04:37,580 --> 01:04:38,820
I got nuts bigger than him.

1203
01:04:38,900 --> 01:04:41,580
Whoa, country-ass,
maple-syrup nigga.

1204
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:44,940
Yeah, you want some biscuits?
You want some biscuits?

1205
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:48,340
Get down!
Get down!

1206
01:04:55,700 --> 01:04:57,620
I can't believe what I just saw.

1207
01:04:57,660 --> 01:04:59,500
These men died
for their country.

1208
01:04:59,540 --> 01:05:02,700
Send flowers
to their bitches and hos.

1209
01:05:06,940 --> 01:05:08,860
I can't break free!

1210
01:05:08,980 --> 01:05:12,620
Think! They must have
some kind of weakness.

1211
01:05:16,940 --> 01:05:18,060
I found it!

1212
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:19,980
Without their heads,
they're powerless!

1213
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:21,900
Please, no.
We mean you no harm.

1214
01:05:22,020 --> 01:05:24,740
We traveled to your planet
to find an evil little girl.

1215
01:05:24,740 --> 01:05:27,620
We must destroy her
before seven days.

1216
01:05:27,620 --> 01:05:30,500
You mean you watched
the videotape?

1217
01:05:30,580 --> 01:05:32,980
Our satellite picked up what
we thought was "Pootie Tang."

1218
01:05:33,020 --> 01:05:34,420
That was a week ago.

1219
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:39,420
And now our entire race will die
unless the girl is destroyed.

1220
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:42,340
Oh, see?
They are peaceful.

1221
01:05:42,380 --> 01:05:45,580
If they're so peaceful,
why were they choking us?

1222
01:05:45,580 --> 01:05:47,540
Oh, that's how we say hello.

1223
01:05:47,580 --> 01:05:49,500
- Hello!
- Nice to see you.

1224
01:05:49,580 --> 01:05:51,500
- Hello.
- Hello.

1225
01:05:51,620 --> 01:05:53,420
Well, how do you guys
say goodbye?

1226
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:57,260
I had to ask.

1227
01:05:57,260 --> 01:06:02,100
If you think that's strange,
you should see how we pee.

1228
01:06:07,620 --> 01:06:10,900
So we're not so different
after all.

1229
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:15,300
There's something
about this place.

1230
01:06:15,420 --> 01:06:17,940
It's like I've seen it before.

1231
01:06:19,780 --> 01:06:21,580
Oh, my God.

1232
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:26,860
This used to be their farm.

1233
01:06:26,940 --> 01:06:28,700
She died right here.

1234
01:06:42,580 --> 01:06:44,940
There's something down there.

1235
01:07:08,060 --> 01:07:11,420
Hey, awesome.
Yeah, you got it.

1236
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:12,580
Just look at this.

1237
01:07:12,660 --> 01:07:15,860
Human beings and aliens
working together.

1238
01:07:15,940 --> 01:07:19,220
We're all just
one big galactic family.

1239
01:07:19,340 --> 01:07:21,020
Family.

1240
01:07:21,020 --> 01:07:23,180
That's just what
I've been running away from.

1241
01:07:23,260 --> 01:07:26,220
Well, that's because
you're an idiot.

1242
01:07:35,740 --> 01:07:37,620
This is it.

1243
01:07:37,660 --> 01:07:39,780
My wife took her
to the family farm

1244
01:07:39,820 --> 01:07:41,860
and drowned her in the well.

1245
01:07:45,140 --> 01:07:49,820
The little girl.
She's frightened of the well.

1246
01:08:08,180 --> 01:08:10,700
Cindy!

1247
01:08:46,420 --> 01:08:48,420
Time to go back
down the well, bitch.

1248
01:08:51,020 --> 01:08:51,900
Cindy!

1249
01:08:51,980 --> 01:08:54,660
No.
Don't hurt him!

1250
01:08:55,580 --> 01:08:56,980
Cindy, come outside.

1251
01:08:57,060 --> 01:08:58,580
The aliens aren't invading.

1252
01:09:00,260 --> 01:09:01,860
Don't worry, Cody.
I'll save you.

1253
01:09:01,980 --> 01:09:03,460
Wait!

1254
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:05,700
Wait.
Don't do this.

1255
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:07,940
You don't have to be evil.

1256
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:12,340
I know what happened
to you, Tabitha.

1257
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:16,260
I know what your mom did.
That was wrong.

1258
01:09:16,380 --> 01:09:18,020
You were just a little girl.

1259
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:21,860
You're still that little girl,
just a lot more corpsy

1260
01:09:21,860 --> 01:09:24,220
and with really bad teeth.

1261
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:28,220
But maybe all you need
is a mother.

1262
01:09:31,740 --> 01:09:33,540
And a father.

1263
01:09:45,700 --> 01:09:46,940
We could be...

1264
01:09:47,020 --> 01:09:48,940
A family.

1265
01:09:53,460 --> 01:09:55,100
Thank you all.

1266
01:09:55,180 --> 01:09:58,460
Your love has broken the curse
and freed my soul.

1267
01:09:58,540 --> 01:10:00,180
I'll never have to kill again.

1268
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:01,820
Really?

1269
01:10:01,900 --> 01:10:05,380
Nah!
I'm just screwing with you!

1270
01:10:07,660 --> 01:10:09,580
I just want to tell you both
good luck.

1271
01:10:09,660 --> 01:10:11,340
We're all counting on you.

1272
01:10:20,100 --> 01:10:21,420
Now it's over.

1273
01:10:22,660 --> 01:10:24,180
Oh, no, no, it's okay.

1274
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:25,660
He's our friend.

1275
01:10:25,740 --> 01:10:27,660
Thank you for saving
our species.

1276
01:10:27,780 --> 01:10:29,580
Now we must return
to our home planet.

1277
01:10:29,700 --> 01:10:30,820
Goodbye, then.

1278
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:33,340
Goodbye.

1279
01:10:51,340 --> 01:10:53,700
Hey, congratulations, George!

1280
01:10:53,780 --> 01:10:55,620
You know the 'hood
always got your back.

1281
01:10:55,700 --> 01:10:57,100
Yeah, yeah!

1282
01:10:57,140 --> 01:10:58,580
Come on!

1283
01:11:02,860 --> 01:11:04,140
Bye!

1284
01:11:17,420 --> 01:11:19,060
Bye!

1285
01:11:19,140 --> 01:11:22,580
Oh, George, I'm so happy.

1286
01:11:22,660 --> 01:11:24,980
