1
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,570
Money, money, money. Hey!

2
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:20,204
You got a date with justice,
one-Eyed Bart.

3
00:01:20,456 --> 00:01:23,207
Too bad, Sheriff. I 'm a married man.

4
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:26,377
One-Eyed Betty!

5
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:43,978
I think you dropped something, mister.

6
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:45,855
- Jessie?
- Give it up, Bart!

7
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,440
You've reached the end of the line!

8
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:49,650
I always wanted to go out with a bang!

9
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:01,078
- Oh, no!
- The orphans!

10
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:06,042
Hate to leave early,
but our ride is here.

11
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:14,091
It's me or the kiddies, Sheriff.
Take your pick.

12
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,722
Ride like the wind, Bullseye!

13
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:26,521
Hold him steady!

14
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:33,236
Woody, hurry!

15
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:55,758
No!

16
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:06,477
Glad I could catch the train!

17
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,813
Now let's catch some criminals.

18
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:11,399
To infinity and beyond!

19
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,084
Reach for the sky.

20
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:31,460
You can't touch me, Sheriff!

21
00:03:31,587 --> 00:03:34,714
I brought my attack dog
with a built-in force field.

22
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:46,475
Well, I brought my dinosaur
who eats force-field dogs.

23
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:07,622
Evil Dr. Pork Chop!

24
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:17,506
That's Mr. Evil Dr. Pork Chop to you.

25
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:57,129
"Buzz, shoot your laser at my badge."

26
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:59,090
"Woody, no. It'll kill you." "Just do it!"

27
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:06,680
"You're going to jail, Bart."
"Watch out!"

28
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:09,934
Mom!

29
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:12,978
No, no, no. Just keep playing.
Just pretend I 'm not here.

30
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:14,146
Oh, no, Molly!

31
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:17,983
No, it's okay, Mom.
It's a 50-foot baby from outer space.

32
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:20,778
And she's on a rampage.
Run for your lives!

33
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:24,031
Buster, get out of there.
Does the red light mean it's going?

34
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,451
Come on.
Say "Happy birthday" to Molly.

35
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,330
- Happy birthday!
- Charming.

36
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,040
Happy birthday!

37
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:37,002
- Look how tall you're getting.
- Yeah!

38
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:47,221
"I came as fast as I could.
Buzz, behind you!"

39
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:48,931
"Got it, Woody."

40
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,767
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!

41
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:55,020
"Good work, Buzz."

42
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:22,965
Okay, places, everyone.
Come on, come on. Get in position.

43
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,217
Wait! I can't find my other eye.

44
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:27,887
- All right, whose foot's in my face?
- It's mine. Give it back.

45
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:30,806
You have saved our lives.
We are eternally grateful.

46
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,100
Buzz! Mind if I squeeze in next to ya?

47
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:37,521
Yes. No. I mean, why would I mind
squeezing next to you?

48
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,398
Is it hot in here?

49
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:40,483
Here they come!

50
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:45,237
Sarge, you got it?

51
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:46,697
Mission accomplished.

52
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:47,948
Hooray!

53
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:51,202
Careful. Careful!

54
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:56,707
All right, guys. We got one shot
at this. Everyone ready?

55
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,584
We're ready, Woody. Let's do it!

56
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,836
Okay, Buzz. Make the call.

57
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,976
Target is on approach.

58
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:18,395
Just like we rehearsed it, guys.

59
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,037
Hello?

60
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,541
Hello? Anyone there?

61
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:41,335
Molly, stay out of my room!

62
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:43,546
I wasn't in your room.

63
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,589
Then who was messing with my stuff?

64
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:47,049
It wasn't me.

65
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:55,724
Well, that went well.

66
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:58,769
He held me! He actually held me!

67
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,813
This is just sad.

68
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:03,315
Who we kiddin'?
The kid 's 17 years old.

69
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,234
We ain't ever gettin' played with.

70
00:08:09,281 --> 00:08:10,656
Guys, hey, hold up.

71
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,409
We need a staff meeting.
Everyone! A staff meeting!

72
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,660
Not again!

73
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:17,830
Come on. Slink, gather everyone up.

74
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,248
We are gathered, Woody.

75
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,834
Okay. First off,

76
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:25,963
we all knew operation Playtime
was a long shot.

77
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:27,464
More like a misfire.

78
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:31,510
But we've always said this job isn't
about getting played with. It's about...

79
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:33,721
Being there for Andy. We know.

80
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:35,347
But we can try again! Right?

81
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:39,768
I 'm callin' it, guys.
We're closing up shop.

82
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,020
What?

83
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:44,607
Andy's going to college any day now.
That was our last shot.

84
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:46,984
We're going into attic mode, folks.

85
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,902
Keep your accessories
with you at all times.

86
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:52,031
Spare parts, batteries, anything
you need for an orderly transition.

87
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:55,659
Orderly? Don't you get it? We're done!
Finished! Over the hill!

88
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:58,454
Hey, hey, hey, now. Come on, guys.
We all knew this day was coming.

89
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,623
Yeah, but now it's here.

90
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:03,042
Look, every toy goes through this.
No one wants to see...

91
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:04,460
Hey, Sarge! What are you doing?

92
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:08,172
War's over, folks.
Me and the boys are moving on.

93
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:10,299
- Moving on?
- You're going AWoL?

94
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,177
We done our duty. Andy's grown up.

95
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,512
And let's face it,
when the trash bags come out,

96
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:17,264
we army guys are the first to go.

97
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,892
- Trash bags?
- Who said anything about trash bags?

98
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:24,104
It has been an honor serving with you.
Good luck, folks.

99
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,232
You're gonna need it.

100
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,068
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait!

101
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:31,654
- We're getting thrown away?
- No. No one's getting thrown away.

102
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:32,905
How do you know?

103
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,032
- We're being abandoned!
- We'll be fine, Jessie.

104
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:37,493
- So why did Sarge leave?
- Should we leave?

105
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,788
- I thought we were goin' to the attic.
- I hate all this uncertainty!

106
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:42,873
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on now. Wait a minute. Quiet!

107
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:46,794
No one's getting thrown out, okay?
We're all still here.

108
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:50,172
I mean, yeah,
we've lost friends along the way.

109
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,842
- Wheezy and Etch and...
- Bo Peep?

110
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,263
Yeah. Even Bo.

111
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:01,600
All good toys
who've gone on to new owners.

112
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:05,354
But through every yard sale, every
spring cleaning, Andy held on to us!

113
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,857
He must care about us,
or we wouldn't be here.

114
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:13,696
You wait. Andy's gonna tuck us in
the attic. It'll be safe and warm...

115
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,156
- And we'll all be together.
- Exactly!

116
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:18,117
There's games up there,
and books, and...

117
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:21,161
- The racecar track!
- The racecar track. Thank you!

118
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:24,623
- And the old TV.
- There you go, the old TV.

119
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:28,877
And those guys from the Christmas
decorations box. They're fun, right?

120
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:30,379
Yeah.

121
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:34,133
And someday, if we're lucky,
Andy may have kids of his own.

122
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:36,760
And he'll play with us then, right?

123
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:38,554
We'll always be there for him.

124
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:41,890
Come on, guys.
Let's get our parts together, get ready,

125
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,435
and go out on a high note.

126
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,270
I 'd better find my other eye.

127
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:48,313
Where'd you leave it this time?

128
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:51,483
Someplace dark. And dusty.

129
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:54,987
Come on. Let's see how much
we're going for on eBay.

130
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:58,699
Don't worry. Andy's gonna
take care of us. I guarantee it!

131
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,768
You guarantee it, huh?

132
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:28,896
I don't know, Buzz.
What else could I say?

133
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:32,649
Well, whatever happens,
at least we'll all be together.

134
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,986
For infinity and beyond.

135
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:38,947
- Can I have your stereo?
- No.

136
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,200
- Why not?
- 'Cause I 'm taking it with me.

137
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:48,373
- Can I have your computer?
- No.

138
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,709
- Your video games?
- Forget it, Molly.

139
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:52,503
Okay. Andy, let's get to work here.

140
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:56,215
Anything you're not taking to college
either goes in the attic, or it's trash.

141
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:59,301
- Mom, I 'm not leaving till Friday.
- Come on. It's garbage day.

142
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,220
- Mom.
- Look, it's simple.

143
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:05,599
Skateboard, college.
Little League trophy, probably attic.

144
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:08,185
Apple core, trash. You can do the rest.

145
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,646
Why do you still have these toys?

146
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:12,731
Molly, out of my room!

147
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:14,525
Three more days and it's mine!

148
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:17,027
Molly, you're not off the hook either.

149
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:18,946
You have more toys
than you know what to do with.

150
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:21,198
Some of them could make
other kids really happy.

151
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:22,407
What kids?

152
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:25,327
The children at the daycare.
They're always asking for donations.

153
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:26,745
What's daycare?

154
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:27,955
- Mom.
- No buts.

155
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:31,792
You choose the toys you want to
donate, I 'll drop them off at Sunnyside.

156
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:44,304
Poor Barbie.

157
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:45,681
I get the Corvette.

158
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,225
Andy, come on.
You need to start making decisions.

159
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,268
Like what?

160
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:51,270
Like what are you gonna do
with these toys?

161
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:52,771
Should we donate them
to Sunnyside?

162
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:54,606
- No.
- Maybe sell them online?

163
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:56,567
Mom, no one's gonna want
those old toys.

164
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,610
They're junk.

165
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:00,404
Fine. You have till Friday.

166
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:03,115
Anything that's not packed for college
or in the attic

167
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:10,581
- is getting thrown out.
- Whatever you say, Mom.

168
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,797
- What's happening?
- We're getting thrown out, you idiot.

169
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:01,882
That's what's happening.

170
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:18,190
- You need a hand?
- I got it.

171
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:19,691
Here.

172
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:21,526
So, you gonna miss me
when I 'm gone?

173
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:24,196
- Lf I say no, do I still get your room?
- Nope.

174
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,906
Then, yes, I 'll miss you.

175
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:27,741
I can't breathe!

176
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:30,160
- This can't be happening!
- Quiet! What's that sound?

177
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:42,339
Andy!

178
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:47,386
That's not trash. That's not trash!

179
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,680
Think, think, Woody.
Think, think, think.

180
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,058
Buster! Come here, boy! Come here!

181
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:00,691
Okay, boy. To the curb!

182
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,488
No, Buster! No!

183
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,326
Get up. Buster!

184
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:29,386
- We're on the curb!
- I knew it would come to this!

185
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,971
Pull, everyone! Pull!

186
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,400
- It won't rip!
- Forget it!

187
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:46,111
It's triple-ply,
high-density polyethylene!

188
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,320
There's gotta be a way out!

189
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:49,030
Andy doesn't want us.
What's the point?

190
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:50,699
Point. Point. Point!

191
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,787
Push! Push!

192
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:57,372
I can hear the garbage truck!

193
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,208
It's getting closer.

194
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,080
Buzz! Jessie!

195
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:50,342
- Andy threw us out.
- Like we were garbage.

196
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:53,178
- Junk. He called us junk.
- How could he?

197
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,097
This doesn't make any sense.

198
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:59,684
I should have seen this coming.
It's Emily all over again.

199
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:02,187
- Sarge was right.
- Yeah, and Woody was wrong.

200
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,856
Wait a minute. Wait, hold on.
This is no time to be hysterical.

201
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:06,650
It's the perfect time to be hysterical.

202
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,443
- Should we be hysterical?
- No!

203
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,570
- Yes!
- Maybe! But not right now!

204
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,991
Fellas, I know what to do.

205
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:22,958
What the heck?

206
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:26,878
- We should 've done this years ago.
- Jessie, wait. What about Woody?

207
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:30,006
He's fine, Buzz.
Andy's taking him to college.

208
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:31,883
Now we need to go!

209
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:34,886
You're right. Come on.

210
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:37,222
- Buzz?
- Woody!

211
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:40,392
What's going on? Don't you know
this box is being donated?

212
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,477
It's under control, Woody.
We have a plan.

213
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:43,812
We're going to daycare!

214
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:46,523
Daycare?
What, have you all lost your marbles?

215
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:49,442
Well, didn't you see?
Andy threw us away.

216
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:51,903
No, no, no, no.
He was putting you in the attic.

217
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:53,822
Attic? So how did we
end up on the curb?

218
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:56,575
That was a mistake.
Andy's mom thought you were trash.

219
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:58,827
Yeah. After he put us in a trash bag.

220
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,495
And called us junk!

221
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:03,748
Yeah, I know. It looks bad.
But, guys, you gotta believe me.

222
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,750
Sure thing, college boy!

223
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:09,546
Andy's moving on, Woody.
It's time we did the same.

224
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,008
Okay. Out of the box.
Everyone, right now!

225
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:16,011
Come on, Buzz. Give me a hand.
We gotta get this thing outta here.

226
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:19,347
Woody, wait. We need to figure out
what's best for everyone.

227
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,689
Great. Great! It's gonna take us
forever to get back here.

228
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:39,451
It's all right, Barbie. You'll be okay.

229
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:44,164
Well, Molly and I have been
growing apart for years.

230
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:48,543
It's just... I can't believe
she would throw me away!

231
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,671
- Welcome to the club, toots.
- Okay, everyone, listen up.

232
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:54,299
We can get back to Andy's,
but we gotta move fast.

233
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,092
We'll hide under the seats
till we get back home.

234
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:57,719
Get it through your vinyl noggin,
Woody.

235
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:58,970
Andy doesn't want us anymore.

236
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:01,431
He was putting you in the attic!

237
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:03,516
He left us on the curb!

238
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:06,353
- All right, calm down! Both of you!
- Okay, fine. Fine.

239
00:19:06,437 --> 00:19:08,063
Just wait till you see
what daycare's like.

240
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:11,775
- Why? What's it like?
- Daycare is a sad, lonely place

241
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:15,028
for washed-up old toys
who have no owners.

242
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:19,783
- Quite the charmer, aren't ya?
- You'll see.

243
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:23,578
As soon as we get to daycare,
you'll be begging to go home.

244
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:40,095
Can anyone see anything?

245
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,138
- There's a playground!
- Wow!

246
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:44,182
We hit the jackpot, Bullseye!

247
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:46,351
So much for sad and lonely, huh?

248
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,686
Okay. Calm down, guys.
Let's just keep this in perspective.

249
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:50,647
Perspective? This place is perfect.

250
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:54,776
Woody, it's nice! See?
The door has a rainbow on it.

251
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,240
- Hey there!
- Wow!

252
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:01,950
Haven't seen you in ages.

253
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,494
I just wanted to drop these old toys off.

254
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:08,164
Is this Bonnie? Look how big you are.

255
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:10,417
- Say hi, sweetie.
- Hi.

256
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:12,710
Hey, how are your kids?
Molly and Andy?

257
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:16,047
Not kids anymore.
Andy's going to college on Friday.

258
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:17,715
- What?
- Can you believe it?

259
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,386
- You sure they won't miss these?
- No, they never get played with.

260
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,849
- You see any kids?
- Where is she taking us?

261
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:34,691
- Look!
- Wow!

262
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,401
What? What is it?

263
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:43,158
No, no, no.

264
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:45,326
What's the matter with you?

265
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:48,163
I can't see!

266
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,999
Okay, everyone. Recess. Come on!

267
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:58,465
- So now what do we do?
- We go back to Andy's.

268
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:01,342
- Anyone see an exit?
- Exit, shmexit. Let's get played with.

269
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:03,928
Careful. These toys might be jealous
of new arrivals.

270
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,180
- I want to see!
- Hey!

271
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,389
- Rex!
- It's my turn!

272
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,521
New toys!

273
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:21,738
Well, howdy! Glad to meet ya.

274
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,656
Buzz Lightyear at your service.

275
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,075
Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.

276
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:31,456
Thank you. May I?

277
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:36,878
The claw!

278
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:47,889
Well, hello there.
I thought I heard new voices.

279
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:52,393
Welcome to Sunnyside, folks.
I 'm Lots-o'-Huggin' Bear.

280
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:54,979
But please call me Lotso.

281
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:56,940
Buzz Lightyear. We come in...

282
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,069
First thing you gotta know about me,
I 'm a hugger.

283
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:04,989
Look at you all. You've been through
a lot today, haven't ya?

284
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:06,783
It's been horrible.

285
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:09,827
Well, you're safe now.
We're all castoffs here.

286
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:13,456
We been dumped, donated,
yard-saled, secondhanded

287
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,834
and just plain thrown out.
But just you wait,

288
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:20,505
you'll find being donated was the
best thing that ever happened to ya.

289
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:24,926
Mr. Lotso, do toys here
get played with every day?

290
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:27,637
All day long. Five days a week.

291
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:29,639
But what happens
when the kids grow up?

292
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:31,516
Well, now, I 'll tell ya.

293
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,852
When the kids get old,
new ones come in.

294
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:37,397
When they get old,
new ones replace them.

295
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:42,443
You'll never be outgrown or neglected,
never abandoned or forgotten.

296
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:45,947
No owners means no heartbreak.

297
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:50,952
- It's a miracle.
- And you wanted us to stay at Andy's.

298
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,495
Because we're Andy's toys!

299
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:55,540
So you got donated by this Andy, huh?

300
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:58,543
Well, it's his loss, Sheriff.
He can't hurt you no more.

301
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:00,795
- Whoa, whoa, no, no, no...
- Now, let's get you all settled in.

302
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:05,133
Ken? Where is that boy?
Ken? New toys!

303
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:07,635
Far out! Down in a jiff, Lotso.

304
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:14,892
So, who's ready for Ken's dream tour?

305
00:23:14,977 --> 00:23:17,562
Let's show our new friends
where they'll be staying.

306
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,063
Folks, if you want to step
right this way...

307
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,533
Hi, I 'm Ken.

308
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:33,745
Barbie. Have we ever met?

309
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:36,414
I would 've remembered.

310
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:39,250
- Love your legwarmers.
- Nice ascot.

311
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:42,295
Come on, Ken.
Recess don't last forever.

312
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:45,340
Right on, Lotso. This way, everybody.

313
00:23:45,466 --> 00:23:50,136
You got a lot to look forward to, folks.
The little ones love new toys.

314
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:53,890
- What a nice bear.
- And he smells like strawberries.

315
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:57,977
Folks, if I can share,
here at Sunnyside, we've got,

316
00:23:58,062 --> 00:23:59,937
well, just about anything
a toy could ask for.

317
00:24:00,022 --> 00:24:01,814
Spare parts, superglue,

318
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:05,360
and enough fresh batteries
to choke a Hungry Hungry Hippo.

319
00:24:06,195 --> 00:24:07,653
- Think you're gettin' old?
- Wow.

320
00:24:07,738 --> 00:24:09,280
Well, stop your worryin'.

321
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:13,368
Our repair spa will keep you stuffed,
puffed, and lightly buffed.

322
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:17,330
And this, well, this is where I live.

323
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:20,208
It's Ken's Dream House.
It has a disco, it's got a dune buggy.

324
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:23,669
And a whole room
just for trying on clothes.

325
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:26,506
You have everything!

326
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:29,467
Everything except
someone to share it with.

327
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:35,807
You need anything at all,
you just come talk to me. Here we are.

328
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:40,853
Well, thank you, Big Baby.

329
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:44,023
Why don't you come meet
our new friends?

330
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:47,944
Poor baby. We were thrown out
together, me and him.

331
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:50,238
Abandoned by the same owner.

332
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:53,157
But we don't need owners
at Sunnyside.

333
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:56,536
We own ourselves.
We're masters of our own fate.

334
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,746
We control our own destiny.

335
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:00,748
Watch out for puddles.

336
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:04,419
And here's where
you folks'll be stayin'.

337
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:06,421
The Caterpillar Room.

338
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:09,674
- Look at this place.
- Wow!

339
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:11,801
Holy moly guacamole.

340
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:13,386
Jackpot, baby.

341
00:25:13,804 --> 00:25:15,263
- Whoa, puppy!
- Hello.

342
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:16,389
- Hello.
- Hello.

343
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:20,268
It's so beautiful!

344
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:25,565
What the... Hey, little guy.

345
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:28,025
How long 's it been
since you all got played with?

346
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,152
It's been years.

347
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:33,448
Well, just you wait. In a few minutes,
that bell's gonna ring,

348
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:36,367
and you'll get the playtime
that you've been dreamin' of.

349
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:39,287
Play! Real play! I can't wait!

350
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:42,248
Now, if you'll excuse us,
we best be headin' back.

351
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:44,375
Welcome to Sunnyside, folks.

352
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,501
- Thank you.
- Take care, pinky.

353
00:25:45,586 --> 00:25:47,128
- Goodbye, Mr. Lotso. Thank you.
- Thank you, buddy boy.

354
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:50,381
- Will I see you again?
- I 'll see you tonight

355
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:51,966
in my dreams.

356
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:54,385
Ken, let's get a move on.

357
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,888
Barbie, come with me.
Live in my dream house.

358
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:58,848
I know it's crazy. I know we just met.

359
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:00,725
Heck, you don't know me
from G.I. Joe,

360
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,894
but when I look at you,
I feel like we were...

361
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:05,229
- Made for each other.
...made for each other.

362
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:07,982
- Yay!
- Yes.

363
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:09,984
- Ken?
- Coming, Lotso.

364
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,988
This is so exciting!

365
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:21,829
Sounds like kids to me.

366
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:25,374
I want to get played with.
Why can't time go faster?

367
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:26,959
How many you reckon are out there?

368
00:26:27,044 --> 00:26:28,836
They sound so sweet.

369
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:38,513
Look, everyone, it's nice here, I admit.

370
00:26:39,181 --> 00:26:41,098
But we need to go home.

371
00:26:41,183 --> 00:26:43,392
We can have
a whole new life here, Woody.

372
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:46,437
A chance to make kids happy again.

373
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:49,273
- Why don't you stay?
- Yeah, Woody. Stay with us.

374
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:50,608
- Come on, Woodster!
- You'll get played with.

375
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:51,776
- I can't. No.
- Stay here.

376
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,861
- You can make a new kid happy.
- No, no. Guys, really. No!

377
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:58,241
I have a kid. You have a kid. Andy!

378
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:02,286
And if he wants us at college,
or in the attic,

379
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:04,080
well, then, our job is
to be there for him.

380
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,624
Now, I 'm going home.

381
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:09,835
Anyone who wants to join me
is welcome. Come on, Buzz.

382
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:15,967
Buzz?

383
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:20,972
Our mission with Andy
is complete, Woody.

384
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,723
What?

385
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:24,850
And what's important now
is we stay together.

386
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:28,104
We wouldn't even be together
if it weren't for Andy!

387
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:30,648
Look under your boot, Buzz.
You, too, Jessie.

388
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:31,941
Whose name is written there?

389
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:36,237
Maybe Andy doesn't
care about us anymore.

390
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:39,073
Of course he does.
He cares about all of you!

391
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:40,825
He was putting you in the attic. I saw.

392
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:42,827
You can't just turn your back
on him now!

393
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:47,039
Woody, wake up! It's over!
Andy is all grown up!

394
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,919
Okay, fine. Perfect.

395
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:55,548
I can't believe how selfish you all are.

396
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:05,766
So this is it?
After all we've been through.

397
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:25,077
Bullseye, no. You need to stay.

398
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:30,333
Bullseye, no, I said, "Stay!"

399
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:33,502
Look,

400
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:38,466
I don't want you left alone
in the attic, okay? Now, stay.

401
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:45,890
Bonnie?

402
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:48,059
I gotta go.

403
00:28:51,355 --> 00:28:53,230
Bonnie, you in here?

404
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:16,545
Come on. Come on. Oh, no, no.

405
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:57,878
What... What the heck?

406
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:01,716
Now, that's better.

407
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:05,428
- Bonnie!
- Bluebells, cockleshells...

408
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:08,514
There you are. Come on, honey.
It's time to go home.

409
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:34,498
No, no, no, no!

410
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:18,125
Reach for the sky!

411
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:22,546
Bluebells, cockleshells. Eenie, miny...

412
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:31,430
You're my favorite deputy.

413
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:33,808
- Bonnie!
- Coming!

414
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:38,813
Great.

415
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:52,868
It's gonna be okay, Bullseye.

416
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:55,746
Woody's going to college with Andy.
It's what he's always wanted.

417
00:31:55,831 --> 00:31:58,415
He's crazy.
College is no place for a toy.

418
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,167
Toys are for playtime.

419
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:03,254
Speaking of playtime,
they're lining up out there!

420
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:05,256
- How many?
- There must be dozens.

421
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,590
I can hardly wait!

422
00:32:06,675 --> 00:32:08,092
Places, everyone!

423
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:24,817
At last! I 'm gonna get played with!

424
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:27,695
- Rex?
- Come to papa.

425
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:24,084
'Here's a snake in my boot.

426
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:29,465
I'd like to join your posse, boys,
but first I'm gonna sing a little song.

427
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:30,549
A sheriff!

428
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,094
Move over, Mr. Pricklepants.

429
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:36,889
We have a guest.
You want some coffee?

430
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:42,937
It's good for you. But don't drink
too much, or you'll have to...

431
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,064
Be right back!

432
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:48,108
Hey, hello? Hi. Excuse me.

433
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,778
Can you tell me where I am?

434
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,279
The guy's just asking a question.

435
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:55,991
Well, excuse me.
I 'm trying to stay in character.

436
00:33:56,993 --> 00:34:00,037
My name's Buttercup.
You've met Baron von Shush.

437
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:01,580
Hello, I 'm Trixie.

438
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:04,959
Guys, hey. Guys, look,
I don't know where I am.

439
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:08,295
We're either in a café in Paris
or a coffee shop in New Jersey.

440
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,339
I 'm pretty sure
I just came back from the doctor

441
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:12,299
with life-changing news.

442
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:15,594
We do a lot of improv here. Just
stay loose, have fun, you'll be fine.

443
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,722
- No, no, no, no. I...
- Who wants lunch?

444
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:24,561
It has a secret ingredient. Jelly beans.

445
00:34:25,522 --> 00:34:27,731
Somebody's poisoned the water hole.

446
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,360
Poison?
Who would do such a mean thing?

447
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:40,452
The scary witch! Look out!
She's using her witch-y powers!

448
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:42,496
"I know where to hide."

449
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:48,502
She'll never find us in here.

450
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:50,838
What's wrong?

451
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:55,634
She found us! We need a spaceship
to get away from the witch!

452
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:58,512
- You're doing great!
- Are you classically-trained?

453
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:00,264
Look, I just need to know
how to get out of here!

454
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:01,724
There is no way out.

455
00:35:02,976 --> 00:35:04,309
Just kidding. Door's right over there.

456
00:35:04,394 --> 00:35:07,438
Well, cowboy, you just
jumped right in, didn't ya? I 'm Dolly.

457
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:08,856
- Woody.
- Woody?

458
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:10,607
Really? You're gonna stick with that?

459
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:13,360
'Cause now's your chance
to change it, new room and all.

460
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:15,070
That's coming from a doll
named Dolly.

461
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:18,699
- Who's the new guy?
- Are you a real cowboy?

462
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,951
- Well, actually...
- 'Course he's not, pea brain.

463
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:24,288
- He don't even have a hat.
- I do too have... My hat!

464
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:26,582
- Told ya.
- I found a spaceship!

465
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:27,958
Showtime.

466
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:30,502
Quick, get in. Fasten your seat belts.

467
00:35:30,587 --> 00:35:34,214
Close your tray tables. Hold on.
It might get a little bumpy.

468
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:37,551
Three, two, one, blastoff!

469
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:45,559
You saved us, cowboy.
You're our hero.

470
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:56,820
I got a kink in my slink.

471
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:01,825
My tail! Where's my tail?

472
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:09,583
Someone need a hand?

473
00:36:10,627 --> 00:36:12,044
- Where's my nose?
- Here it is.

474
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:13,378
- Here's your arm.
- Give me that. That's mine.

475
00:36:13,463 --> 00:36:14,588
Honey, the mustache?

476
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:17,466
I don't recall playtime being
quite that strenuous.

477
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:20,844
Andy never played with us like that.

478
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:22,805
We're just gonna have to
make the best of it.

479
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:24,681
But these toddlers,
they don't know how to play with us.

480
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:27,101
- They're too young!
- Yeah, they're sticky.

481
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,769
Well, we should be
in the Butterfly Room.

482
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,437
- With the big kids!
- That's right.

483
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:32,523
- Yeah, you said it.
- We'll get this straightened out.

484
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:35,275
I 'll go talk to Lotso
about moving us to the other room.

485
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,697
Blast. Try that one.

486
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:42,950
It's locked!

487
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:45,035
- Same here.
- Try the windows.

488
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:48,038
Negatory.
It's a Fenster-Schneckler 380.

489
00:36:48,123 --> 00:36:49,832
Finest childproof lock in the world.

490
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:51,959
- We're trapped!
- Wait.

491
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,377
Did anyone notice the transom?

492
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:56,964
Oh, great. How do we get up there?

493
00:36:58,842 --> 00:37:02,469
All right, everyone. On three!
One, two...

494
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,346
- Three!
- Whoa!

495
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:07,641
Let go!

496
00:37:19,529 --> 00:37:20,571
Go!

497
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,286
- He did it!
- Yes, sir!

498
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:29,788
Way to go, Buzz!

499
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:35,127
Yeah, you think
they had a fun playtime?

500
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:36,336
They might hear you.

501
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:40,924
- Okay, now you start.
- I...

502
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:42,259
- Love...
- You.

503
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:44,636
See? That time, I said "love."
Okay, now me first.

504
00:37:44,721 --> 00:37:45,762
- Okay, okay, okay.
- I...

505
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:47,014
- Love...
- You.

506
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:49,099
You see what I mean?
It changes every time.

507
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:50,893
You are so smart.

508
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:52,603
Come on, Romeo. We're late.

509
00:37:53,146 --> 00:37:54,980
- I 'll wait up for you.
- Kisses!

510
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:00,337
All right, place your bets.
Come on, everybody.

511
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:01,588
- Come on. Any splits?
- Heya. Bring it here.

512
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:02,673
- All right.
- Here we go.

513
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:04,841
- Come on, horsey, come on!
- Come on, turkey, come on, turkey.

514
00:39:04,926 --> 00:39:06,468
- Gobble, gobble, baby.
- Come on, horsey.

515
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:07,511
Come on, duck.

516
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:09,513
- All right, that's it. No more bets.
- Come on! Right here.

517
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:11,682
Let me have the duck, let me have
the duck, let me have the duck!

518
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:13,267
Here is a duck.

519
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:15,519
- I won!
- Ah, man!

520
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:18,814
- Well, Stretch takes the round.
- You lost!

521
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:20,524
Okay, minimum bet, five Monopoly.

522
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,109
- Coyote's wild.
- Here, here.

523
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,694
- Two greens here.
- Changing two double A's.

524
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:25,904
Hey, what do you guys think
of the new recruits? Any keepers?

525
00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:27,781
Oh, please! Landfill!

526
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:30,367
- Cowgirl? Dinosaur?
- Toddler fodder.

527
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:33,287
But that space guy, he could be useful.

528
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:37,249
He ain't the sharpest knife in the
place where they keep the knives.

529
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,376
Neither are you, Chunk.

530
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:42,087
You got a little keeper yourself,
didn't you, Ken?

531
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:44,673
Hey, lay off, Twitch. Barbie's different.

532
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:46,675
Aw, Mr. Softy over here.

533
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:48,802
What do you expect from a girl's toy?

534
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:53,098
I 'm not a girl's toy! I 'm not!
Why do you guys keep saying that?

535
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:54,808
All them toys are disposable.

536
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:57,769
We'll be lucky if they last us a week.

537
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:05,652
Well, well. Looky who we have here.

538
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:08,071
Let me go!

539
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:09,823
Take him to the libary.

540
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:10,949
No!

541
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:43,899
1225 Sycamore.

542
00:40:44,484 --> 00:40:45,859
Woody, what are you doing?

543
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:47,903
I gotta get outta here.

544
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:50,947
- You're leaving?
- But didn't you have fun today?

545
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:52,783
Well, of course I did,
more than I 've had in years,

546
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:55,035
but, you see,
I belong to someone else.

547
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:58,288
- Who's "Yid-nuh"?
- I believe it's pronounced "Yid-nay."

548
00:40:58,373 --> 00:41:00,290
Guys, it says "Andy."

549
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:01,625
He's my Bonnie.

550
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:03,794
And he's leaving soon.
I gotta get home.

551
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:06,588
- Where's home?
- Elm Street. 234 Elm.

552
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:09,966
- You guys have a map?
- We're on it, cowboy. Trixie?

553
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,427
I 'll fire up the computer.

554
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:21,019
Unhand me, you cowards!
I demand to talk to Lotso!

555
00:41:21,104 --> 00:41:22,687
Zip it, Buck Rogers.

556
00:41:22,772 --> 00:41:25,440
You don't talk to Lotso
till we say you can...

557
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:31,321
Ken? What's goin' on here?
Why is this toy tied up?

558
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:33,198
He got out, Lotso.

559
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:39,704
"Got out"? No, no, no, no, no.
This isn't how we treat our guests.

560
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:44,251
F-A-oh, my Schwarz.
There you go. I 'm so sorry.

561
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:46,878
- Lotso, there's been a mistake.
- A mistake?

562
00:41:46,963 --> 00:41:49,172
The children in the Caterpillar Room
are not age-appropriate

563
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:50,507
for me and my friends.

564
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:53,552
We respectfully request
a transfer to the Butterfly Room.

565
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:55,470
Well, request granted!

566
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:57,973
- But, Lotso...
- Hush now, Kenneth.

567
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:01,351
This toy's shown initiative, leadership.

568
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:03,603
Why, I 'd say
we've found ourselves a keeper.

569
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:06,606
Hear that, everyone? We got a keeper!

570
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:12,529
We're calling you up
to the big leagues, son.

571
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:15,449
From now on,
you'll have anything you want.

572
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,576
Excellent. I 'll go get my friends.

573
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:20,245
Whoa, whoa. Hold on there, boss.

574
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:22,706
Those Caterpillar kids
need someone to play with.

575
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,708
But my friends don't belong there.

576
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:26,877
None of us do, I agree.

577
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:30,380
Which is why,
for the good of our community,

578
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:32,924
we ask the newer toys,
the stronger ones,

579
00:42:33,009 --> 00:42:36,720
to take on the hardships
the rest of us can't bear anymore.

580
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:40,223
Well, I guess that makes sense.

581
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:45,061
But I can't accept.
We're a family. We stay together.

582
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:47,939
Family man, huh? I understand.

583
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:50,233
Put him back in the timeout chair.

584
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:53,695
What are ya... Unhand me!

585
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,823
Bring in the Bookworm.

586
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:02,287
Here it is.

587
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:05,499
It was filed under "Lightyear."

588
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:11,713
Let's see here.

589
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:15,175
"Accessories. Maintenance."
Here we go.

590
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,929
"Remove screws to access
battery compartment."

591
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:20,180
What are you doing?

592
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:21,848
Stop!

593
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:23,475
Let go of me!

594
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:28,897
"To return your Buzz Lightyear action
figure to its original factory settings..."

595
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:29,940
No!

596
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:32,943
"...slide the switch from
Play to Demo."

597
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:36,530
Stop! No! No! No!

598
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:40,283
- What was that?
- Sounds like it came from the hall.

599
00:43:40,368 --> 00:43:41,993
I 'll see what it was.

600
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:46,289
What do you see? Anything?

601
00:43:46,374 --> 00:43:49,918
No, just a dark hallway and...
Wait. Wait!

602
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:51,670
I see Andy!

603
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:53,505
- What?
- That's impossible.

604
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:56,049
No, no, I really see him. In his room.

605
00:43:56,968 --> 00:44:00,053
My other eye! The one I left behind.

606
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:06,226
'His is so weird. He's packing up.

607
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:11,815
Here comes Buster.
Out of the way! Get away!

608
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:14,901
Okay, Andy's out in the hall.

609
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:17,821
He's looking in the attic.

610
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:21,241
Wait, there's Mom.
Why is he so upset?

611
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:25,078
Oh, no! Oh, this is terrible!

612
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:29,666
He's looking for us.
Andy's looking for us!

613
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,251
He's looking for us?

614
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:34,170
So Andy does want us.
I knew it! I just knew it!

615
00:44:34,255 --> 00:44:36,590
I think he did mean
to put us in the attic.

616
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:38,425
Well, then,
Woody was telling the truth.

617
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:40,677
- Holy cow!
- And you didn't believe him.

618
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:42,304
Hey, you didn't believe him first!

619
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:45,307
Guys, we gotta... We gotta go home!

620
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:48,977
- Lotso!
- Hey, there.

621
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:51,646
How y'all doin' this fine evenin'?

622
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:54,024
Thank goodness! Have you seen Buzz?

623
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:56,484
There's been a mistake.
We have to go.

624
00:44:56,569 --> 00:45:01,072
Go? Why, you just got here.
In the nick of time, too.

625
00:45:01,157 --> 00:45:04,117
We were runnin' low on volunteers
for the little ones.

626
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:06,953
They just love new toys,
now, don't they?

627
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:09,998
"Love"? We've been chewed,
kicked, drooled on.

628
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:12,042
Just look at my pocketbook!

629
00:45:13,294 --> 00:45:17,464
Well, here's the thing, sweet potato.
You ain't leavin' Sunnyside.

630
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:20,967
"Sweet potato"!
Who do you think you're talking to?

631
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:25,847
I have over 30 accessories,
and I deserve more respect...

632
00:45:26,766 --> 00:45:28,391
That's better.

633
00:45:28,476 --> 00:45:31,061
Hey, no one takes my wife's mouth,
except me.

634
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:33,188
Give it back, you furry air freshener!

635
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:34,939
Come on, guys. We're goin' home.

636
00:45:35,024 --> 00:45:36,066
Whoa there, missy.

637
00:45:36,484 --> 00:45:38,151
You're not goin' anywhere.

638
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:41,029
Oh, yeah? And who's gonna stop us?

639
00:45:43,324 --> 00:45:44,658
Buzz! You're back!

640
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:46,201
Buzz?

641
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:48,286
Hey!

642
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:50,664
Look out!

643
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:52,165
What are you, nuts?

644
00:45:52,375 --> 00:45:53,416
Buzz!

645
00:45:57,129 --> 00:45:59,464
Prisoners disabled,
Commander Lotso!

646
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:01,758
- Buzz, what are you doing?
- Silence, minions of Zurg!

647
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:03,927
You're in the custody
of the Galactic Alliance!

648
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:05,470
- "Zurg"?
- "Galactic Alliance"?

649
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:06,596
Oh, boy.

650
00:46:06,681 --> 00:46:09,432
Good work, Lightyear.
Now, lock 'em up!

651
00:46:09,517 --> 00:46:10,517
Yes, sir!

652
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:22,779
Where do you think you're going?

653
00:46:24,115 --> 00:46:25,782
Buzz! We're your friends!

654
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:27,826
Spare me your lies, temptress.

655
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:29,369
Your emperor's defeated,

656
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:32,580
and I 'm immune to
your bewitching good looks.

657
00:46:32,665 --> 00:46:35,291
Hey, Mongo!
Keep your paws off my wife!

658
00:46:35,376 --> 00:46:37,127
Hey! Let go of me,
you drooling doofus!

659
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:38,169
Not him.

660
00:46:38,254 --> 00:46:41,798
I think this potato needs to
learn himself some manners.

661
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:43,633
Take him to the box.

662
00:46:43,718 --> 00:46:46,469
Hey! Put me down, you moron!
Where are you taking me?

663
00:46:46,554 --> 00:46:47,971
Bad baby! Bad baby!

664
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:49,597
Ken? What's going on?

665
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:52,976
Barbie! I told you to wait
in the Dream House.

666
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,352
What are you doing to my friends?

667
00:46:54,729 --> 00:46:56,229
Get in there!

668
00:46:57,732 --> 00:46:59,607
- Barbie, wait!
- Don't touch me.

669
00:46:59,692 --> 00:47:02,193
- We're through!
- Barbie! I did...

670
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:05,905
And give me my scarf back!

671
00:47:07,867 --> 00:47:10,744
Lightyear! Explain our
overnight accommodations.

672
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:13,955
Sir, yes, sir!
Prisoners sleep in their cells.

673
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:17,792
Any prisoner caught outside their cell
spends the night in the box.

674
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:20,044
Roll call at dusk and dawn.

675
00:47:20,463 --> 00:47:24,257
Any prisoner misses roll call,
spends the night in the box.

676
00:47:24,592 --> 00:47:27,343
Prisoners do not speak
unless spoken to.

677
00:47:27,428 --> 00:47:29,721
Any prisoner talks back,
spends the night...

678
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:31,264
In the box! We get it.

679
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:35,477
At ease, soldier. They're neutralized.

680
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:39,022
But remember, they'll say anything
to make you doubt yourself.

681
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:40,440
Don't worry, Commander.

682
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:43,693
Any doubt I had got pounded
out of me at the academy.

683
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:45,904
Listen up, folks.

684
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:48,531
We got a way of doin' things
here at Sunnyside.

685
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:51,659
If you start at the bottom,
pay your dues,

686
00:47:51,744 --> 00:47:54,037
life here can be a dream come true!

687
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:57,916
But if you break our rules,
step outta line,

688
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:04,339
try to check out early,
well, you're just hurtin' yourselves.

689
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:07,967
Woody! What did you do to him?

690
00:48:08,469 --> 00:48:10,804
You all get a good night's rest.

691
00:48:11,472 --> 00:48:14,182
You got a full day
of playtime tomorrow.

692
00:48:20,189 --> 00:48:23,566
1225 Syca...

693
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:27,111
Who's Velocistar237?

694
00:48:27,488 --> 00:48:29,739
That's just a dinosaur toy
down the street.

695
00:48:29,823 --> 00:48:32,242
That's nothing.
Let me just take care of that.

696
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:34,118
- Just a dinosaur.
- All right.

697
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:37,330
Sycamore. Okay, enter!

698
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:40,208
Please don't be far. Please, please!

699
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:45,046
Right around the corner?
It's right around the corner!

700
00:48:46,131 --> 00:48:50,468
I 'm going to college! Look at me!
I 'm big toy on campus! Hello!

701
00:48:50,553 --> 00:48:53,263
- Hey, I 'll see you at the sock hop.
- Okay, Potsie.

702
00:48:53,514 --> 00:48:56,933
Hey, listen. If any of you guys
ever get to Sunnyside Daycare,

703
00:48:57,017 --> 00:48:58,101
you tell 'em Woody made it home.

704
00:48:58,185 --> 00:49:01,396
- You came from Sunnyside?
- But how'd you escape?

705
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,314
Well, it wasn't easy.

706
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:05,525
What do you mean "escape"?

707
00:49:07,152 --> 00:49:10,238
Sunnyside is a place
of ruin and despair.

708
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:13,866
Ruled by an evil bear
who smells of strawberries.

709
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:16,202
Lotso?

710
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:18,955
The guy may seem plush
and huggable on the outside,

711
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:20,748
but inside, he's a monster.

712
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:23,209
But... How do you know that?

713
00:49:23,877 --> 00:49:26,212
Chuckles. He'll tell you.

714
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:33,970
Yeah, I knew Lotso.

715
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:38,099
He was a good toy. A friend.

716
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:42,604
Me and him,
we had the same kid, Daisy.

717
00:49:44,148 --> 00:49:47,066
A was there
when Lotso got unwrapped.

718
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:51,237
Daisy loved us all.

719
00:49:51,739 --> 00:49:52,905
But Lotso,

720
00:49:53,365 --> 00:49:55,158
Lotso was special.

721
00:49:56,619 --> 00:49:58,828
'Hey did everything together.

722
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:02,957
You've never seen
a kid and a toy more in love.

723
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:05,793
One day, we took a drive.

724
00:50:06,879 --> 00:50:10,089
Hit a rest stop. Had a little playtime.

725
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:13,176
After lunch, Daisy fell asleep.

726
00:50:22,353 --> 00:50:23,978
She never came back.

727
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,444
Lotso wouldn't give up.

728
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:38,368
It took forever,
but we finally made it back to Daisy's.

729
00:50:45,209 --> 00:50:47,960
But by then, it was too late.

730
00:50:59,515 --> 00:51:02,308
Something changed that day
inside Lotso.

731
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:04,602
Something snapped.

732
00:51:04,687 --> 00:51:07,146
She replaced us. Come on!

733
00:51:07,231 --> 00:51:10,108
- No, she only replaced you!
- She replaced all of us.

734
00:51:10,818 --> 00:51:11,859
Didn't she?

735
00:51:14,988 --> 00:51:17,365
She don't love you no more!

736
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:19,117
Now come on!

737
00:51:23,997 --> 00:51:29,627
We were lost. Cast off.
Unloved. Unwanted.

738
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:36,551
'Hen we found Sunnyside.

739
00:51:47,396 --> 00:51:49,731
But Lotso wasn't my friend anymore.

740
00:51:51,442 --> 00:51:53,484
He wasn't anyone's friend.

741
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:59,282
He took over Sunnyside
and rigged the whole system.

742
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:01,826
So how'd you get out?

743
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:05,580
I got broke.
Bonnie found me, took me home.

744
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:08,332
Other toys, they weren't so lucky.

745
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:12,545
It ain't right what Lotso done.
New toys,

746
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:15,298
they don't stand a chance.

747
00:52:15,591 --> 00:52:17,884
- But my friends are in there.
- You can't go back.

748
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:20,344
Returning now would be suicide!

749
00:52:20,429 --> 00:52:22,221
But what about your Andy?

750
00:52:22,306 --> 00:52:25,224
Isn't he leaving for college?

751
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:46,162
Quiet, musical hog! Knock it off!

752
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:52,293
Oh, Bullseye. I miss Woody, too.

753
00:52:54,505 --> 00:52:56,756
But he ain't ever comin' back.

754
00:53:18,529 --> 00:53:20,988
Rise and shine, campers!

755
00:53:21,073 --> 00:53:22,657
Commander Lotso, sir!

756
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:25,034
All quiet, nothing to report.

757
00:53:25,118 --> 00:53:28,663
Excellent, Lightyear. Come on.
We need ya back at Star Command.

758
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:31,123
Wait! What've you done
with my husband?

759
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:32,708
Big Baby.

760
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:39,632
Sweetheart!

761
00:53:41,134 --> 00:53:45,221
It was cold and dark. Nothing but sand
and a couple of Lincoln Logs.

762
00:53:46,014 --> 00:53:47,640
I don't think those were Lincoln Logs.

763
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:51,477
You all get ready.
You got a play-date with destiny!

764
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:14,852
Hello?

765
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:16,646
You shouldn't have
come back, cowboy.

766
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:21,108
'Hey've cracked down hard since
you left. More guards, more patrols.

767
00:55:21,193 --> 00:55:23,319
You and your friends
ain't ever getting out of here now.

768
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:24,654
I made it out once.

769
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:27,615
You got lucky once. Want my advice?

770
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:30,117
Keep your heads down. You'll survive.

771
00:55:30,202 --> 00:55:31,827
Yeah, for how long?

772
00:55:31,912 --> 00:55:33,079
I've been here years.

773
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:35,539
'Hey'll never break me.

774
00:55:35,624 --> 00:55:38,417
'Here's only one way
toys leave this place.

775
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:42,046
Poor fella. Trash truck comes at dawn.

776
00:55:42,506 --> 00:55:44,382
Then it's off to the dump.

777
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:47,176
Look, I appreciate
your concern, old-timer.

778
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:50,346
But we have a kid waiting for us.
Now, we're leaving.

779
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:53,683
If you'd help us, one toy to another,
I 'd sure be grateful.

780
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,937
Well, if you're gonna get out,

781
00:55:58,021 --> 00:55:59,772
first thing you gotta get through's
the doors.

782
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:04,694
Locked, every night. Inside and out.
Keys are left on a hook in the office.

783
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:05,820
Got it. What else?

784
00:56:05,904 --> 00:56:08,114
Lotso has trucks
patrolling all night long.

785
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:10,533
Hallway, lobby, playground.

786
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:11,701
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
What about the wall?

787
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:15,121
Eight-feet high. Cinder block.
No way through it.

788
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:16,455
You go over or under.

789
00:56:16,832 --> 00:56:18,708
That's it? Doesn't seem so bad.

790
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:21,460
It's not.
Your real problem's the monkey.

791
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:25,381
The monkey's the eye in the sky.

792
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:27,049
He sees everything.

793
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:29,301
Classrooms.

794
00:56:40,147 --> 00:56:41,480
Hallways.

795
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:52,074
Even the playground.

796
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,753
You can unlock doors,
sneak past guards, climb the wall,

797
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:07,465
but if you don't take out that monkey,
you ain't going nowhere.

798
00:57:08,049 --> 00:57:11,260
You wanna get out of here?
Get rid of that monkey!

799
00:57:12,471 --> 00:57:14,388
Recess! Come on, kids!

800
00:57:20,812 --> 00:57:21,937
Hey, guys.

801
00:57:22,898 --> 00:57:24,398
- Woody?
- Woody!

802
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:25,858
Woody!

803
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:28,736
- Hey, hey, hey, buddy!
- Thank goodness!

804
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:31,071
- You're alive!
- 'Course I 'm alive!

805
00:57:32,324 --> 00:57:35,117
Hey, my hat! Wait, where's Buzz?

806
00:57:35,202 --> 00:57:36,869
Lotso did something to him!

807
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:39,121
He thinks he's a real
Space Ranger again.

808
00:57:39,206 --> 00:57:40,623
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

809
00:57:40,999 --> 00:57:42,583
Return of the astro-nut.

810
00:57:42,918 --> 00:57:47,421
Woody, we were wrong to leave Andy.
I was wrong.

811
00:57:47,756 --> 00:57:50,132
Jessie's right, Woody. She was wrong.

812
00:57:50,217 --> 00:57:53,469
No, no, it's my fault
for leaving you guys.

813
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:55,805
From now on, we stick together.

814
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:57,640
But Andy's leavin' for college.

815
00:57:57,724 --> 00:57:59,600
College? Hog-tie the mailman!

816
00:57:59,684 --> 00:58:02,311
We gotta get you home
before Andy leaves tomorrow!

817
00:58:02,395 --> 00:58:03,938
Tomorrow? But that means...

818
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:06,023
It means
we're busting out of here, tonight.

819
00:58:06,107 --> 00:58:08,984
- What? Impossible!
- But there's no way out of here!

820
00:58:09,402 --> 00:58:11,403
No, there is one way out.

821
00:58:11,947 --> 00:58:12,947
One way.

822
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:17,409
Okay, here's what we're gonna do.

823
00:58:23,083 --> 00:58:25,000
- Springy dog.
- Present.

824
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:27,169
Green guys.

825
00:58:27,254 --> 00:58:29,380
- Cowgirl.
- Here.

826
00:58:29,798 --> 00:58:30,965
Horse.

827
00:58:32,092 --> 00:58:33,592
- Piggy bank.
- Y o.

828
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:35,803
- Tyrannosaurus.
- Here.

829
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:38,055
- Barbie.
- Here.

830
00:58:38,598 --> 00:58:40,015
Potato Head.

831
00:58:41,142 --> 00:58:42,560
Potato Head?

832
00:58:43,728 --> 00:58:46,480
Hey! Hey!
Tuberous root-man! Wake up!

833
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:48,858
Impossible!

834
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:51,527
Hey!

835
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:06,917
Little late for a stroll, eh, Potato Head?

836
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:09,587
That's Mr. Potato Head to you,
smoothie.

837
00:59:09,921 --> 00:59:13,340
Well, well, well. You're turning out to
be quite the troublemaker, aren't you?

838
00:59:13,466 --> 00:59:16,051
What did you think you were
gonna do? Waltz right out of here?

839
00:59:16,136 --> 00:59:17,386
Yeah, and I would 've got away
with it, too,

840
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:19,054
if it weren't for you meddling toys!

841
00:59:19,139 --> 00:59:20,514
You ascot-wearing pink-noser!

842
00:59:20,891 --> 00:59:22,975
You're not a toy! You're an accessory!

843
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:25,227
You're a purse with legs.

844
00:59:25,312 --> 00:59:26,645
Take him back to the box.

845
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:31,066
No! No, not the box! I 'm sorry.
I didn't mean it! I like ascots.

846
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:33,652
Really. No, no, no!

847
00:59:34,195 --> 00:59:35,237
Okay, check.

848
00:59:35,488 --> 00:59:39,408
Good work, Lightyear. All right,
resume your space-guy-thingy.

849
00:59:39,492 --> 00:59:41,869
Yes, sir, well-groomed man!

850
00:59:41,953 --> 00:59:44,079
Ken! Ken?

851
00:59:47,208 --> 00:59:48,542
What do you want?

852
00:59:48,627 --> 00:59:52,046
I can't take it here, Ken. I wanna go
to the Butterfly Room. With you!

853
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:53,964
Yeah, well, you should 've
thought of that yesterday.

854
00:59:54,174 --> 00:59:55,424
I was wrong.

855
00:59:55,508 --> 00:59:58,636
I wanna be with you, Ken, I do.
In your Dream House.

856
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:02,139
Please take me away from this!
Take me away!

857
01:00:03,558 --> 01:00:04,558
Darn it, Barbie!

858
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:07,603
Okay, but things
are complicated around here.

859
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:10,814
- You gotta do what I say.
- I will, Ken! I promise!

860
01:00:12,859 --> 01:00:15,653
Wait. I 'll do anything!
I 'll change your diapers!

861
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:04,201
Go get the tape!

862
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:13,585
And this is where the magic happens.

863
01:01:14,963 --> 01:01:16,296
Look at all your clothes!

864
01:01:16,381 --> 01:01:18,215
I can't believe
you never brought me up here!

865
01:01:18,591 --> 01:01:20,759
- Tennis whites? Mission to Mars!
- I know, I know, I know.

866
01:01:20,844 --> 01:01:22,553
Check this out! Kung fu fighting.

867
01:01:22,637 --> 01:01:25,806
Campus hero
with matching sports pennant, huh?

868
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:28,475
Flower power! Oh, Ken!

869
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:33,355
No one appreciates clothes
here, Barbie. No one.

870
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:38,402
Ken, would you
model a few outfits for me?

871
01:01:38,945 --> 01:01:40,362
Just a few?

872
01:02:11,061 --> 01:02:12,144
Go get the key.

873
01:02:13,646 --> 01:02:14,772
Where is it, where is it?

874
01:02:14,856 --> 01:02:16,815
Where's the key?
Where's the key? Bingo!

875
01:02:27,494 --> 01:02:29,369
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

876
01:02:29,454 --> 01:02:32,372
I told you,
keep your hands off of my stuff!

877
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:34,166
Make a move, porky!

878
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:37,795
Hey, hey, hey! No fighting! Break it up!

879
01:02:40,006 --> 01:02:42,216
- Hey! Hey!
- Take that, walnut-brain.

880
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:43,467
No wonder you're extinct.

881
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:46,720
Hey, you can't hit each other.
That's my job!

882
01:02:50,642 --> 01:02:52,184
Help! Prison riot!

883
01:02:55,271 --> 01:02:56,814
Get the tortilla.

884
01:03:37,272 --> 01:03:38,772
- Ready?
- Ready.

885
01:03:46,739 --> 01:03:47,823
Barbie?

886
01:03:50,034 --> 01:03:52,703
No more games, Ken!
What did Lotso do to Buzz?

887
01:03:52,787 --> 01:03:54,037
And how do we switch him back?

888
01:03:54,122 --> 01:03:56,039
You can't make me talk. You can't!

889
01:03:57,750 --> 01:03:59,418
But I 'd like to see you try.

890
01:04:51,137 --> 01:04:53,889
Let's see. Hawaiian surf trunks.

891
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:56,725
Barbie! Those were vintage!

892
01:04:56,809 --> 01:04:58,685
It's okay. All right, go ahead,
rip 'em, I don't care.

893
01:04:58,770 --> 01:05:00,229
They're a dime a dozen.

894
01:05:00,313 --> 01:05:01,647
Glitter tux.

895
01:05:03,274 --> 01:05:06,568
Who cares? Who cares?
Sequins are tacky. Who cares?

896
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:08,862
A Nehru jacket.

897
01:05:09,239 --> 01:05:10,405
Barbie! Not the Nehru.

898
01:05:10,490 --> 01:05:13,242
This is from what, 1967?

899
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:14,910
The groovy formal collection, yes!

900
01:05:15,203 --> 01:05:18,664
- What a shame.
- Oh, no, no, no! No!

901
01:05:18,998 --> 01:05:20,832
There's an instruction manual!

902
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:24,294
Lotso switched Buzz to Demo mode!

903
01:05:25,463 --> 01:05:27,172
Where's that manual?

904
01:05:28,508 --> 01:05:31,260
I don't know why
this couldn't wait until morning, Ken,

905
01:05:31,886 --> 01:05:33,512
but here you go.

906
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:48,151
What's takin' so doggone long?

907
01:05:52,407 --> 01:05:53,907
So how do we fix Buzz?

908
01:06:11,884 --> 01:06:13,302
What are you looking at, feathers?

909
01:06:15,555 --> 01:06:16,638
Hey!

910
01:06:22,228 --> 01:06:23,812
Yeah, fly away, you coward.

911
01:06:26,899 --> 01:06:28,900
Well, that's just great.

912
01:06:35,199 --> 01:06:36,491
Help! Prison riot!

913
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:38,744
- Mayday! Mayday!
- Give it up. No one can hear you.

914
01:06:39,245 --> 01:06:42,247
- What?
- I said, "No one can hear you."

915
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:45,250
- What?
- He said, "No one can..."

916
01:06:45,335 --> 01:06:46,960
Shush! Will you be quiet?

917
01:06:47,503 --> 01:06:48,587
Woody! You're back!

918
01:06:52,508 --> 01:06:53,800
Stop him! Don't let him get out!

919
01:06:53,885 --> 01:06:56,887
Star Command! I 've been
taken hostage by my own prisoners.

920
01:06:58,931 --> 01:07:00,724
Quick! Open his back.
There's a switch!

921
01:07:00,808 --> 01:07:02,392
Unhand me, Zurg scum!

922
01:07:02,643 --> 01:07:05,103
The Galactic Courts
will show you no mercy.

923
01:07:06,439 --> 01:07:08,690
It's not working. Why is it
not working? Where's the manual?

924
01:07:08,775 --> 01:07:11,360
Here we go! There should be
a little hole under the switch.

925
01:07:11,444 --> 01:07:14,071
- Little hole, got it!
- "To reset your Buzz Lightyear,

926
01:07:14,155 --> 01:07:16,239
- "insert paperclip..."
- Rex, use your finger!

927
01:07:16,324 --> 01:07:17,324
What?

928
01:07:18,117 --> 01:07:19,618
- Okay, now what?
- All right, let's see.

929
01:07:19,827 --> 01:07:22,954
"Caution. Do not hold button
for more than five seconds."

930
01:07:26,125 --> 01:07:27,459
It's not my fault!

931
01:07:37,178 --> 01:07:39,554
- Now what did you do?
- I just did what you told me!

932
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:49,272
Amigos! We're all amigos.

933
01:07:56,823 --> 01:07:58,073
We gotta switch him back.

934
01:07:58,157 --> 01:08:01,243
- Well, how do we do that?
- I don't know. That part's in Spanish.

935
01:08:02,161 --> 01:08:04,037
We don't have time for this.
Come on, El Buzzo.

936
01:08:08,334 --> 01:08:09,835
Good luck, cowboy.

937
01:08:15,758 --> 01:08:17,134
Here they come.

938
01:08:19,512 --> 01:08:21,012
Come on, Buzz!

939
01:08:22,807 --> 01:08:24,266
What took you so long?

940
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:26,601
Things got complicated.
Where's Potato Head?

941
01:08:26,686 --> 01:08:28,061
We haven't seen him.

942
01:08:30,523 --> 01:08:31,606
Buzz.

943
01:08:40,867 --> 01:08:42,200
Did you fix Buzz?

944
01:08:43,035 --> 01:08:44,494
- Sort of.
- Behind you.

945
01:08:44,829 --> 01:08:46,121
Someone's coming.

946
01:08:49,709 --> 01:08:52,627
You would not believe
what I 've been through tonight.

947
01:08:52,712 --> 01:08:54,462
Darling! Are you okay?

948
01:08:54,547 --> 01:08:57,048
I feel fresh. Healthy. It's terrible.

949
01:08:57,133 --> 01:09:00,260
You've lost weight. And so tall.

950
01:09:02,096 --> 01:09:04,389
You're a sight for detachable eyes.

951
01:09:09,937 --> 01:09:10,937
All clear.

952
01:09:14,609 --> 01:09:16,151
Come on. Come on.

953
01:09:18,279 --> 01:09:19,321
We're almost there.

954
01:09:24,076 --> 01:09:25,410
Back up. Back up!

955
01:09:32,084 --> 01:09:33,335
Come on.

956
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:52,664
Woody!

957
01:10:54,834 --> 01:10:56,501
Come on. We're almost there.

958
01:11:05,428 --> 01:11:07,762
Buzz, come here. Give me a lift.

959
01:11:19,692 --> 01:11:21,484
Way to go, Buzz. Come on.

960
01:11:25,823 --> 01:11:28,950
- Is it safe?
- I guess I 'll find out.

961
01:11:35,374 --> 01:11:37,292
- Woody? You okay?
- Yeah.

962
01:11:37,877 --> 01:11:40,295
Come on down. But not all at once.

963
01:11:40,379 --> 01:11:42,255
- What did he say?
- I think he said, "All at once."

964
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:43,631
No. No. No, no, no, no, no!

965
01:11:43,716 --> 01:11:45,133
- Geronimo!
- Look out!

966
01:11:48,888 --> 01:11:49,929
Thanks, Jess.

967
01:11:51,724 --> 01:11:52,724
Almost there, guys.

968
01:11:53,476 --> 01:11:55,393
Slink, you think you can make it?

969
01:11:55,478 --> 01:11:58,772
Well, I might be old,
but I still got a spring in my step.

970
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:03,026
- He did it!
- All right, Slinkykins.

971
01:12:03,110 --> 01:12:04,819
Okay, climb across.

972
01:12:07,907 --> 01:12:09,282
You lost, little doggie?

973
01:12:13,245 --> 01:12:15,622
Well, well. Look who's back.

974
01:12:23,798 --> 01:12:25,256
I'm sorry, cowboy.

975
01:12:26,926 --> 01:12:28,218
They broke me.

976
01:12:28,302 --> 01:12:31,054
What are y'all doing?
Running back to your kid?

977
01:12:31,722 --> 01:12:33,765
He don't want you no more.

978
01:12:33,849 --> 01:12:35,058
- That's a lie.
- Is it?

979
01:12:35,601 --> 01:12:37,268
Tell me this, Sheriff.

980
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:40,480
If your kid loves you so much,
why is he leaving?

981
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:42,774
You think you're special, cowboy?

982
01:12:43,192 --> 01:12:47,445
You're a piece of plastic.
You were made to be thrown away.

983
01:12:48,948 --> 01:12:50,698
Speak of the devil.

984
01:12:56,539 --> 01:12:59,749
Now, we need toys
in our Caterpillar Room

985
01:12:59,834 --> 01:13:02,502
and you need to avoid that truck.

986
01:13:02,586 --> 01:13:06,464
Why don't you come on back,
join our family again?

987
01:13:06,549 --> 01:13:10,051
This isn't a family! It's a prison!
You're a liar and a bully!

988
01:13:10,511 --> 01:13:14,430
And I 'd rather rot in this dumpster
than join any family of yours!

989
01:13:14,557 --> 01:13:18,268
Jessie's right! Authority should derive
from the consent of the governed,

990
01:13:18,352 --> 01:13:19,644
not from the threat of force.

991
01:13:21,021 --> 01:13:22,939
If that's what you want.

992
01:13:24,859 --> 01:13:27,861
Barbie! Wait! Don't do this, Lotso.

993
01:13:27,987 --> 01:13:32,157
She's a Barbie doll, Ken.
There's a hundred million just like her.

994
01:13:33,075 --> 01:13:34,325
Not to me, there's not.

995
01:13:35,953 --> 01:13:38,496
Fine. Then why don't you join her!

996
01:13:41,542 --> 01:13:42,917
Oh, Ken!

997
01:13:43,002 --> 01:13:44,169
Everyone, listen!

998
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:47,630
Sunnyside could be cool and groovy
if we treated each other fair.

999
01:13:48,132 --> 01:13:50,884
It's Lotso.
He's made us into a pyramid,

1000
01:13:50,968 --> 01:13:52,635
and he put himself on top!

1001
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:54,721
Anyone concur with Ken?

1002
01:13:57,892 --> 01:14:00,602
I didn't throw you away. Your kid did.

1003
01:14:00,686 --> 01:14:03,271
Ain't one kid ever loved a toy, really.

1004
01:14:03,355 --> 01:14:05,273
Chew on that
when you're at the dump.

1005
01:14:05,357 --> 01:14:07,358
Wait! What about Daisy?

1006
01:14:09,612 --> 01:14:11,321
I don't know what you're talking about.

1007
01:14:11,405 --> 01:14:14,032
Daisy? You used to do
everything with her?

1008
01:14:14,116 --> 01:14:16,117
- Yeah? Then she threw us out.
- No.

1009
01:14:16,619 --> 01:14:18,953
- She lost you.
- She replaced us!

1010
01:14:19,038 --> 01:14:20,872
She replaced you.

1011
01:14:20,956 --> 01:14:22,790
And if you couldn't have her
then no one could.

1012
01:14:23,042 --> 01:14:25,460
You lied to Big Baby
and you've been lying ever since.

1013
01:14:26,879 --> 01:14:29,255
- Where'd you get that?
- She loved you, Lotso.

1014
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:30,506
She never loved me.

1015
01:14:30,591 --> 01:14:32,467
As much as any kid ever loved a toy.

1016
01:14:36,805 --> 01:14:37,805
Mama.

1017
01:14:38,182 --> 01:14:40,683
What? You want your mommy back?

1018
01:14:40,768 --> 01:14:43,603
She never loved you.
Don't be such a baby!

1019
01:14:46,982 --> 01:14:48,316
Push 'em in. All of 'em!

1020
01:14:49,401 --> 01:14:52,403
This is what happens
when you dummies try to think.

1021
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:57,116
We're all just trash, waiting to be
thrown away! That's all a toy is!

1022
01:14:58,869 --> 01:15:01,788
Hey, stop it! Put me down, you idiot!

1023
01:15:03,916 --> 01:15:06,417
No! No! Wait a minute! Big Baby, wait!

1024
01:15:09,463 --> 01:15:11,714
- He's gone!
- Holy cow.

1025
01:15:16,804 --> 01:15:18,054
Come on. Hurry!

1026
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:26,062
For crying out loud!

1027
01:15:30,609 --> 01:15:31,609
Woody!

1028
01:15:36,156 --> 01:15:37,949
Oh, boy. Incoming!

1029
01:15:40,285 --> 01:15:41,369
Come on!

1030
01:15:42,830 --> 01:15:43,871
Barbie, no!

1031
01:15:48,460 --> 01:15:49,502
Woody!

1032
01:15:53,507 --> 01:15:54,632
No!

1033
01:15:59,096 --> 01:16:01,222
Can you hear me? Is everyone okay?

1034
01:16:01,306 --> 01:16:04,100
Of course not, you imbecile.
We're doomed!

1035
01:16:06,145 --> 01:16:07,603
Everyone, go to Buzz. Come on.

1036
01:16:10,107 --> 01:16:12,108
We all here? Slinky? Rex?

1037
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:18,406
Against the wall, everybody. Quick!

1038
01:16:20,576 --> 01:16:21,576
Buzz!

1039
01:16:32,171 --> 01:16:33,171
They'll never make it!

1040
01:16:43,057 --> 01:16:44,098
Look out!

1041
01:16:48,854 --> 01:16:49,979
Buzz!

1042
01:16:56,945 --> 01:16:59,739
- Anyone see him?
- Over here, y'all. I found him.

1043
01:17:03,410 --> 01:17:04,994
Buzz, you okay?

1044
01:17:05,704 --> 01:17:08,164
Buzz! Buzz!

1045
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:19,675
That wasn't me, was it?

1046
01:17:19,802 --> 01:17:23,805
Buzz, you're back! You're back,
you're back, you're back, you're back!

1047
01:17:23,889 --> 01:17:26,474
Yes, I 'm back. Where have I been?

1048
01:17:26,850 --> 01:17:28,810
Beyond infinity, Space Ranger.

1049
01:17:29,061 --> 01:17:32,063
Woody! So where are we now?

1050
01:17:32,314 --> 01:17:34,565
In a garbage truck
on the way to the dump!

1051
01:17:47,871 --> 01:17:49,872
Hold on, we're going in!

1052
01:18:05,389 --> 01:18:06,848
You got all your pieces?

1053
01:18:06,932 --> 01:18:08,516
The claw!

1054
01:18:09,309 --> 01:18:12,145
- My babies!
- Hey, guys! No! No!

1055
01:18:13,564 --> 01:18:14,605
No!

1056
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:22,488
Hang on!

1057
01:18:35,627 --> 01:18:37,044
Woody! What do we do?

1058
01:18:37,129 --> 01:18:38,838
We'll be okay if we stay togeth...

1059
01:18:40,132 --> 01:18:41,757
- Woody!
- Slinky!

1060
01:18:43,302 --> 01:18:45,303
It's a magnet! Watch out!

1061
01:18:45,804 --> 01:18:48,181
Don't worry, Slink, we'll get you down.

1062
01:18:48,265 --> 01:18:49,932
You might wanna take a look at this.

1063
01:18:53,979 --> 01:18:55,521
Quick! Grab something metal!

1064
01:19:00,819 --> 01:19:02,195
You heard the guy.

1065
01:19:06,116 --> 01:19:07,825
It's not working!

1066
01:19:11,538 --> 01:19:14,707
Help! Help me. I 'm stuck!

1067
01:19:15,083 --> 01:19:17,585
Help, please! Help!

1068
01:19:18,337 --> 01:19:19,378
Woody!

1069
01:19:22,007 --> 01:19:23,674
- Thank you.
- Don't thank me yet.

1070
01:19:26,595 --> 01:19:27,595
Woody!

1071
01:19:37,397 --> 01:19:38,522
Go, go!

1072
01:19:44,529 --> 01:19:45,905
Thank you, Sheriff.

1073
01:19:45,989 --> 01:19:47,198
We're all in this together.

1074
01:19:47,491 --> 01:19:48,616
Right, guys?

1075
01:19:50,077 --> 01:19:51,118
Guys?

1076
01:19:51,370 --> 01:19:53,537
Woody! Down here!

1077
01:19:56,208 --> 01:19:58,209
- Woody!
- Oh, boy.

1078
01:20:00,295 --> 01:20:02,546
Woody, look. I can see daylight.

1079
01:20:02,631 --> 01:20:04,382
We're gonna be okay!

1080
01:20:05,259 --> 01:20:06,342
Hey!

1081
01:20:07,052 --> 01:20:08,678
I don't think that's daylight.

1082
01:20:14,893 --> 01:20:16,143
Run!

1083
01:20:32,786 --> 01:20:36,038
Sheriff! The button! Help me!

1084
01:20:36,123 --> 01:20:37,164
Come on!

1085
01:20:39,334 --> 01:20:41,377
Go. Go! Hit the button!

1086
01:20:48,969 --> 01:20:50,094
Hurry!

1087
01:20:53,348 --> 01:20:55,891
- Just push it! Push it!
- Push it!

1088
01:20:56,977 --> 01:20:59,353
Where's your kid now, Sheriff?

1089
01:20:59,896 --> 01:21:01,022
No. No!

1090
01:21:01,231 --> 01:21:02,273
Lotso!

1091
01:21:04,568 --> 01:21:05,735
No!

1092
01:21:22,919 --> 01:21:23,919
Rex!

1093
01:21:29,926 --> 01:21:32,094
Buzz! What do we do?

1094
01:22:52,509 --> 01:22:54,260
The claw.

1095
01:23:22,205 --> 01:23:25,082
You know all that bad stuff I said
about Andy's attic?

1096
01:23:25,167 --> 01:23:26,417
I take it all back.

1097
01:23:26,751 --> 01:23:28,502
- You're darn tootin'.
- You said it.

1098
01:23:34,885 --> 01:23:37,720
Oh, darling. You were so brave.

1099
01:23:39,222 --> 01:23:42,558
- You saved our lives.
- And we are eternally grateful.

1100
01:23:43,935 --> 01:23:45,227
My boys!

1101
01:23:45,312 --> 01:23:46,520
Daddy!

1102
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:49,064
Hey! Where's that fur ball Lotso?

1103
01:23:49,149 --> 01:23:51,192
Yeah. I 'd like to loosen his stitchin'.

1104
01:23:51,443 --> 01:23:54,028
Forget it, guys. He's not worth it.

1105
01:24:03,413 --> 01:24:04,872
- Hey!
- What you got?

1106
01:24:04,956 --> 01:24:07,625
I had me one of these
when I was a kid.

1107
01:24:08,418 --> 01:24:09,877
Strawberries.

1108
01:24:13,924 --> 01:24:17,134
Hey, buddy. You might wanna
keep your mouth shut.

1109
01:24:23,266 --> 01:24:25,726
Come on, Woody.
We gotta get you home.

1110
01:24:25,810 --> 01:24:28,229
- That's right, college boy.
- Wait.

1111
01:24:29,105 --> 01:24:30,314
What about you guys? I mean,

1112
01:24:31,650 --> 01:24:33,984
maybe the attic's
not such a great idea.

1113
01:24:34,444 --> 01:24:39,073
- We're Andy's toys, Woody.
- We'll be there for him, together.

1114
01:24:40,825 --> 01:24:43,118
- I just hope he hasn't left yet.
- Wait a minute!

1115
01:24:43,203 --> 01:24:44,912
Wait, I 'll check!

1116
01:24:44,996 --> 01:24:48,958
Andy's still packing.
But he's almost done!

1117
01:24:49,042 --> 01:24:52,836
- He lives halfway across town.
- We'll never get there in time!

1118
01:25:08,603 --> 01:25:11,063
- Come on, Buster.
- Is that it, honey? You got everything?

1119
01:25:11,147 --> 01:25:12,815
Yeah. Just a few more boxes
in my room.

1120
01:25:12,899 --> 01:25:13,899
Okay. Come on.

1121
01:25:17,487 --> 01:25:18,696
That's enough. That's enough.
That's enough!

1122
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:20,698
All right. Go. Go, go!

1123
01:25:29,124 --> 01:25:30,457
Okay. All clear.

1124
01:25:39,217 --> 01:25:40,759
There you are.

1125
01:25:46,891 --> 01:25:48,684
- There you go.
- Buzz.

1126
01:25:52,063 --> 01:25:56,108
- This isn't goodbye.
- Hey, Woody. Have fun at college.

1127
01:25:56,443 --> 01:25:58,068
Yeah, but not too much fun.

1128
01:25:59,612 --> 01:26:02,239
- Woody, take care of Andy.
- Yeah.

1129
01:26:02,324 --> 01:26:04,950
He's a good kid.
Tell him to get a haircut.

1130
01:26:05,785 --> 01:26:06,785
Sure thing.

1131
01:26:08,079 --> 01:26:10,873
Jessie, you'll be okay in the attic?

1132
01:26:11,291 --> 01:26:14,376
'Course I will. Besides, I know about

1133
01:26:14,461 --> 01:26:17,046
- Buzz's Spanish mode.
- My what?

1134
01:26:17,130 --> 01:26:18,714
Honey, you want some food
for the road?

1135
01:26:18,798 --> 01:26:19,882
I 'll get something on the way.

1136
01:26:21,843 --> 01:26:23,260
You know where to find us, cowboy.

1137
01:26:38,401 --> 01:26:39,777
Did you say goodbye to Molly?

1138
01:26:39,861 --> 01:26:42,488
Mom, we've said goodbye
like 10 times.

1139
01:26:46,201 --> 01:26:47,451
Andy.

1140
01:26:54,542 --> 01:26:56,668
Mom, it's okay.

1141
01:26:58,338 --> 01:27:00,297
I know. It's just...

1142
01:27:03,301 --> 01:27:05,761
I wish I could always be with you.

1143
01:27:08,014 --> 01:27:09,640
You will be, Mom.

1144
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:27,157
Hey, aren't you gonna say goodbye
to Buster?

1145
01:27:27,242 --> 01:27:29,451
Of course I am. Who's a good doggy?

1146
01:27:29,536 --> 01:27:32,413
Who's a good doggy? I 'm gonna
miss you. I 'm gonna miss you.

1147
01:27:36,626 --> 01:27:40,170
- I 'm gonna miss you.
- Don't, Andy.

1148
01:27:41,756 --> 01:27:46,385
Good boy.
He's telling you to go already.

1149
01:27:46,469 --> 01:27:47,636
Come on. Get the rest of your things.

1150
01:27:48,012 --> 01:27:51,181
Okay, Buster.
Now don't let Molly near my stuff.

1151
01:27:57,730 --> 01:27:58,814
Hey.

1152
01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:09,741
Hey, Mom! So, you really think
I should donate these?

1153
01:28:10,118 --> 01:28:13,036
It's up to you, honey.
Whatever you wanna do.

1154
01:28:40,899 --> 01:28:43,734
"Don't go in there!
The bakery is haunted!"

1155
01:28:43,818 --> 01:28:47,112
"Are you crazy?
You'll wake up all the ghosts."

1156
01:28:47,197 --> 01:28:49,656
"Look out!
The ghosts are throwing pies!"

1157
01:28:52,118 --> 01:28:53,118
Mom.

1158
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:55,496
- Andy?
- Hi.

1159
01:28:55,580 --> 01:28:57,372
Wow. Look at you.

1160
01:28:57,457 --> 01:28:59,333
Well, I hear you're off to college.

1161
01:28:59,417 --> 01:29:01,335
Yeah. Right now, actually.

1162
01:29:01,419 --> 01:29:03,545
So, what can we do for you?

1163
01:29:04,422 --> 01:29:05,839
I have some toys here.

1164
01:29:06,341 --> 01:29:07,925
You hear that, Bonnie?

1165
01:29:08,676 --> 01:29:10,469
So, you're Bonnie?

1166
01:29:11,638 --> 01:29:12,971
I 'm Andy.

1167
01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:16,767
Someone told me
you're really good with toys.

1168
01:29:17,393 --> 01:29:20,687
These are mine,
but I 'm going away now,

1169
01:29:21,648 --> 01:29:23,774
so I need someone really special
to play with them.

1170
01:29:32,075 --> 01:29:35,118
This is Jessie, the roughest,
toughest cowgirl in the whole West.

1171
01:29:35,787 --> 01:29:39,665
She loves critters, but none more
than her best pal, Bullseye.

1172
01:29:42,794 --> 01:29:43,794
Here.

1173
01:29:57,350 --> 01:30:02,062
This is Rex, the meanest, most
terrifying dinosaur who ever lived!

1174
01:30:07,986 --> 01:30:12,072
The Potato Heads. Mr. And Mrs.
You gotta keep 'em together,

1175
01:30:12,323 --> 01:30:14,324
'cause they're madly in love.

1176
01:30:14,784 --> 01:30:18,412
Now Slinky here is
as loyal as any dog you could want.

1177
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:21,331
And Hamm,
he'll keep your money safe,

1178
01:30:21,791 --> 01:30:26,628
but he's also one of the most dastardly
villains of all time, evil Dr. Pork Chop.

1179
01:30:29,924 --> 01:30:32,843
These little dudes
are from a strange alien world.

1180
01:30:33,261 --> 01:30:34,594
Pizza Planet.

1181
01:30:36,264 --> 01:30:37,514
And this

1182
01:30:39,976 --> 01:30:43,312
is Buzz Lightyear, the coolest toy ever!

1183
01:30:43,688 --> 01:30:46,481
Look, he can fly and shoot lasers!

1184
01:30:47,025 --> 01:30:50,193
He's sworn to protect the galaxy
from the evil Emperor Zurg.

1185
01:30:52,113 --> 01:30:54,531
To infinity and beyond!

1186
01:30:55,867 --> 01:30:58,702
Now, you gotta promise
to take good care of these guys.

1187
01:31:00,872 --> 01:31:04,499
They mean a lot to me.

1188
01:31:10,381 --> 01:31:11,715
My cowboy!

1189
01:31:15,428 --> 01:31:17,763
Woody? What's he doing in there?

1190
01:31:18,890 --> 01:31:21,516
- "There's a snake in my boot."
- Wha?

1191
01:31:23,561 --> 01:31:25,687
There's a snake in my boot.

1192
01:31:39,869 --> 01:31:44,081
Now, Woody, he's been my pal
for as long as I can remember.

1193
01:31:45,375 --> 01:31:47,918
He's brave, like a cowboy should be.

1194
01:31:48,586 --> 01:31:49,961
And kind. And smart.

1195
01:31:51,589 --> 01:31:55,884
But the thing that makes Woody
special is he'll never give up on you.

1196
01:31:57,261 --> 01:31:58,387
Ever.

1197
01:31:59,263 --> 01:32:01,973
He'll be there for you, no matter what.

1198
01:32:05,812 --> 01:32:08,605
You think you can
take care of him for me?

1199
01:32:09,607 --> 01:32:10,732
Okay then.

1200
01:32:21,994 --> 01:32:25,539
Oh, no! Dr. Pork Chop's attacking
the haunted bakery!

1201
01:32:25,623 --> 01:32:28,333
The ghosts are getting away.
Woody'll stop 'em!

1202
01:32:28,418 --> 01:32:29,960
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!

1203
01:32:31,087 --> 01:32:32,796
And we'll actually need the rocket.

1204
01:32:33,256 --> 01:32:35,799
They're getting away!
Come on, Bullseye!

1205
01:32:38,344 --> 01:32:41,888
We need to get in the spaceship.
The volcano is gonna erupt.

1206
01:32:41,973 --> 01:32:44,766
Look! They're being attacked
by a real dog!

1207
01:32:44,851 --> 01:32:46,226
You can eat my poisonous scones!

1208
01:32:46,310 --> 01:32:48,478
Mr. And Mrs. Potato Head
are in trouble.

1209
01:32:48,563 --> 01:32:50,105
Get on, Woody.

1210
01:32:51,941 --> 01:32:53,608
It's my friend Woody.

1211
01:32:54,444 --> 01:32:57,279
Buzz, hurry!
Get your extra turbo booster.

1212
01:33:24,724 --> 01:33:26,183
Thanks, guys.

1213
01:33:30,271 --> 01:33:32,772
Look, Mommy.
They're all playing together.

1214
01:33:32,857 --> 01:33:34,357
Come on. Let's get some lunch.

1215
01:33:48,539 --> 01:33:50,207
So long, partner.

1216
01:33:55,213 --> 01:33:58,590
Hey, Buzz. You haven't met
Bonnie's toys yet. Hey, come here.

1217
01:33:58,674 --> 01:34:01,384
You're gonna love them.
Buzz, this is Dolly.
