00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:56,107

165
00:08:05,786 --> 00:08:07,819
Pull the truck over!

166
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,988
I said pull the fucking truck over
right fucking now!

167
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,724
You owe me a car,

168
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:14,226
and it'd better be a fucking Lamborghini,
you bitch!

169
00:08:14,228 --> 00:08:15,560
I did it!

170
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:16,962
You have the right
to remain silent.

171
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,330

176
00:08:30,143 --> 00:08:31,576
JENKO: What happened?

177
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:32,778
SCHMIDT:
I think they got away.

178
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:38,650
Is that a hickey?

179
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:43,788
Oh. This was actually
an octopus-related incident.

180
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:48,860
I'd opened a crate
and the octopus had
leapt onto my face.

181
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:51,663
Apparently, they have
many, many arms.

182
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:53,098
They have eight tentacles.

183
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,466
Yes, and...

184
00:08:54,468 --> 00:08:56,434
Look, ladies,

185
00:08:56,436 --> 00:09:00,872
nobody gave a shit about
the jump street reboot
when you first came on.

186
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,941
Anyone with half a brain,
myself included,

187
00:09:02,943 --> 00:09:05,744
thought it was destined
to fail spectacularly.

188
00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:07,312
But you got lucky.

189
00:09:07,314 --> 00:09:09,080
So now this department
has invested

190
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:13,118
a lot of money to make sure
jump street keeps going.

191
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,353
We've doubled their budget.

192
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:18,189
As if spending twice the money
guaranteed twice the profit.

193
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:19,758
(LAUGHING)

194
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,593
Like that's going to work.

195
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:25,864
Yeah. Well,
the commissioner's convinced
this debacle happened

196
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:28,600
because you weren't
doing the same
undercover student thing

197
00:09:28,602 --> 00:09:30,001
you did the first time.

198
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:32,337
She doesn't get
that it's always worse

199
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:33,339
the second time around.

200
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:36,207
You settle into
worn-out roles.

201
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:38,877
One gets possessive,
the other runs away.

202
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:41,079
You begin a slow,
painful unraveling,

203
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,615
as all the good things
that came before

204
00:09:43,617 --> 00:09:47,052
begin to be crushed
by the trash compactor of sadness.

205
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:50,221
That doesn't sound like us.
I mean... (CHUCKLES)

206
00:09:50,223 --> 00:09:51,890
I'm getting a divorce.

207
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:56,528
We don't want to
do the same thing.

208
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:58,930
We want to burst
through our ceiling.

209
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,265
And you're gonna
find another ceiling

210
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:01,800
and you got to
bust through that one,

211
00:10:01,802 --> 00:10:02,601
and you just got to
keep hammering ceilings.

212
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:04,502
Okay, okay, okay.

213
00:10:04,504 --> 00:10:07,172
What if we actually went
into the secret service

214
00:10:07,174 --> 00:10:08,640
and, like, tried to
protect the white house?

215
00:10:08,642 --> 00:10:10,809
I think...
I don't think that would work.

216
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:12,544
I'm going to ask you
to stop talking.

217
00:10:12,546 --> 00:10:13,979
I thought it was
a pretty good idea.

218
00:10:13,981 --> 00:10:17,716
Do the same thing as last time,
everyone's happy.

219
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:23,655
I can't believe
the Koreans bought
their church back.

220
00:10:23,657 --> 00:10:25,423
Yeah. Good thing
there was an even bigger

221
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:27,158
abandoned church
directly across the street.

222
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,829
Yeah. That's convenient.
Yes, it is convenient.

223
00:10:30,831 --> 00:10:32,364
Next year, we'll probably
just be right back across the street.

224
00:10:32,366 --> 00:10:33,765
Just next door.

225
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:35,600
(SCOFFS) Let's not get
ahead of ourselves.

226
00:10:35,602 --> 00:10:36,868
We're not ahead of ourselves.

227
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,110
We're right next to each other.

228
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:44,109
This is awesome.
Like, way more expensive for no reason.

229
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:46,044

like jump street now?

to babysit
you two fuckers again.

237
00:11:01,728 --> 00:11:04,162
Designed it myself.
We got an espresso bar.

238
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:05,964
I'm thinking about
a shark tank over there.

239
00:11:05,966 --> 00:11:07,432
Ooh, I like sharks.

240
00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:11,202
Fuck a 21 jump street,
and fuck a Korean Jesus.

241
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:13,104
Whoa! Cap, come on,
Korean Jesus is right there.

242
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:14,739
DICKSON:
That's Vietnamese Jesus.

243
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:16,941
See, this a Vietnamese church.

We're going to college for real?

and they get laser-focused
for about four hours of studying,

That's Cynthia Watson.

00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:23,742
She was a student at MC state.

270
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:24,976
She took some whyphy,

271
00:12:24,978 --> 00:12:26,244
got locked out of her dorm,

272
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:27,479
ended up falling off the roof.

273
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:29,514
And now she's dead.

274
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:34,953
That's her buying drugs
on campus.

275
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:36,654
And that's the dealer.

the supplier.

Sir, can I just say,

278
00:12:41,728 --> 00:12:45,597
it is so refreshing
to have a case
with a black victim.

279
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:48,299
I mean,
we care so much more
because she's black.

280
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:50,568
I think what he's
really trying to say

281
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:53,371
is that we care equally.

282
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:56,541
It's a tie, really,
how much we care.

283

Uh... no, we're not.

put the books
inside the computers.

and find out who the dealer is.

sees through,
by the way.

You got to decide,
do I just keep
doing the same thing,

or am I gonna
choose a different path

GIRL: All right,
so what would you...

475
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,856
Hey, that girl's
in my psych class.

476
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:27,258
Damn, she's hot.
Go talk to her.

477
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,759
You come talk to her with me.

478
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:31,462
Stop being a pussy
and go talk to her. Go.

Hey.
Hi.

00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:42,554
I think we're in
the same psych class.

484
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:44,642
Oh, yeah. Hi.

Cynthia, that girl who died,

497
00:21:14,641 --> 00:21:15,840
she used to come here
all the time, right?

498
00:21:15,842 --> 00:21:17,074
Mmm.

499
00:21:17,076 --> 00:21:19,877
This piece is called <i> areolas.</i>

500
00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:22,346
Did you know her?

501
00:21:22,348 --> 00:21:24,315
Yeah, she lived
across the hall from me.

502
00:21:24,317 --> 00:21:25,750
Yeah?
So why do you care so much?

503
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:28,352
I'm... I'm writing a...

504
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:30,588
<i>Greedy man hands!</i>

505
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:33,157
...a slam poem
in her honor.

Early stages, very early stages.

507
00:21:34,761 --> 00:21:36,060
Oh, really?
Yeah, yeah.

508
00:21:36,062 --> 00:21:37,561
Wouldn't it be better

509
00:21:37,563 --> 00:21:39,130
just to, like,
plan the stuff out
ahead of time,

510
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:42,800
and then not say it
in front of people
and embarrass yourself?

511
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:46,237
That's a thing
that people do.
That's stand-up comedy.

512
00:21:46,239 --> 00:21:47,371
That's probably
what you should do,

513
00:21:47,373 --> 00:21:49,073
because that stuff's funny.

00:21:54,614 --> 00:21:56,614
I actually think
it's really powerful.

517
00:21:56,616 --> 00:21:58,149
That's cool that you said that,

518
00:21:58,151 --> 00:22:00,351
'cause I actually thought it
was really powerful, too,

519
00:22:00,353 --> 00:22:03,020

was talking about
her nips and shit.

Look, they sent us

to find the dealer
of this new synthetic,

and no one will
tell us anything.

That's 'cause
you guys look like

to go to Berkeley.

they gave us a picture,
so we do have that.

I know,
but we can't see his face,
so we don't know who it is.

00:25:55,621 --> 00:25:57,655
We don't know who it is.

Yeah.
Huh?

There's a reflection right here.

634
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:29,987
Your fucking guy's got a tattoo.

Find the tattoo,
find the dealer.

636
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:37,728
Fuck, man, I don't know.
I do a lot of stupid
tattoos to drunk kids.

Do you remember
that stupid tattoo?

I don't know.

00:31:58,183 --> 00:32:00,183
I'm never gonna make any money,

786
00:32:00,185 --> 00:32:02,119
so don't tell my parents, but...

787
00:32:02,121 --> 00:32:03,320
When I talk to
your parents tonight,

788
00:32:03,322 --> 00:32:05,155
I will not tell them
about your major.

789
00:32:05,157 --> 00:32:06,757
Okay, thank you.
You're welcome.

790
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:08,191
All right, art major.

791
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:10,961
What do you think about that?

792
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:15,666
Um, I would say that

793
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:20,070
it's these two beings

794
00:32:20,072 --> 00:32:22,940
leaning up
against each other
in perfect balance.

795
00:32:22,942 --> 00:32:25,609
If one were to fall,
they would just
lose each other.

796
00:32:26,577 --> 00:32:28,679
So it's just about support.

797
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:33,483
You can't admit
that it looks
exactly like testicles?

798
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:37,120
(LAUGHING) That's exactly
what it looks like.

799
00:32:40,224 --> 00:32:42,893
So, is there someone
who supports you?

800
00:32:42,895 --> 00:32:44,394
No, I'm just one of those people

801
00:32:44,396 --> 00:32:46,563
that really likes to
spend time with myself.

802
00:32:47,665 --> 00:32:50,033
Tell me about it.

803
00:32:50,035 --> 00:32:53,370
I love to be alone.
I am, like,
the best at it.

804
00:32:53,372 --> 00:32:56,373
I just love when you're
sitting there in a room,

805
00:32:56,375 --> 00:32:57,975
and you're just there
with your thoughts,

806
00:32:57,977 --> 00:33:00,043
and you're like,
oh, my gosh, I'm alone.

807
00:33:00,045 --> 00:33:01,845
Would anyone ever
love me? Or whatever.

808
00:33:01,847 --> 00:33:04,614
And, like, do I know
anyone who would care

809
00:33:04,616 --> 00:33:06,717
if I just ever came out
of this room or not?

810
00:33:06,719 --> 00:33:08,352
Or whatever and, like...

811
00:33:08,354 --> 00:33:09,519
I don't know.
It's just peaceful.
I just like it.

812
00:33:09,521 --> 00:33:11,154
Yeah.

813
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:13,090
Well, if you don't want
to be alone tonight,

814
00:33:13,092 --> 00:33:14,852
we are gonna go hang out
at the art building,

815
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:16,526
if you want to come.

816
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:18,562
Okay, okay.

817
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:21,631
Okay. Okay.

I expected tonight
would go in a way that
you wouldn't expect,

821
00:33:30,109 --> 00:33:31,508
but what I didn't expect
was tonight would go

822
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,443
in the exact way
that you would expect.

823

You know what I mean?
Totally.

824
00:33:36,415 --> 00:33:38,248
So you guys hang out here a lot?

825
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:40,717
Yeah. I mean,
we're not into the whole
frat party kind of stuff.

826
00:33:40,719 --> 00:33:42,452
We like to sit around,
just drink some good wine

827
00:33:42,454 --> 00:33:44,454
and talk about
some important stuff.

828

Banging bitches
and getting wasted
all fucking day.

Those are, like, two of
my favorite things to do.

830

You are, like,
a slightly less
attractive version of...

Picasso?
Picasso.

832
00:33:54,466 --> 00:33:55,532
Right? I've been
told that before.

833

It's only 2:00.
I thought it was late.
Do you want to come in?

841
00:34:26,065 --> 00:34:29,332
It's only 2:00?

It's impossible.
You can't fucking do it.

847

The fans used to rush the field

00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:46,483
after every win
and tear down
the goalposts,

849
00:34:46,485 --> 00:34:49,052
and coach hated it.
And so he cemented
them in.

850
00:34:49,054 --> 00:34:50,454
They storm the field,
and still do it,

but they just bounce around.

this goalpost, bro!

come to practice today?

you're obviously good enough
to play on the team.

Look, I'm not
supposed to be here
to play football.

00:35:30,762 --> 00:35:32,462
What?

868
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:34,464
I'm just here to
do my assignments

and get out, that's it.

I mean, yeah, school's
important or whatever,

but when I was
throwing you those passes,

it was like I knew
where you were gonna be
before you went there.

00:35:58,357 --> 00:36:00,290
and then
the goalposts came down.

00:58:59,435 --> 00:59:00,769
I fucking hate my dad so much.

1403
00:59:00,771 --> 00:59:02,170
Do you have any idea

1404
00:59:02,172 --> 00:59:03,405
what it's like to
have a guy like that

1405
00:59:03,407 --> 00:59:05,140
telling you what
to do all the time?

00:59:05,142 --> 00:59:06,575
I can only imagine.

1407
00:59:06,577 --> 00:59:09,978
I just don't understand
what his problem is
with you specifically.

1408
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:12,814
(SIGHS) I don't... Jesus.
That makes no sense to me.

1409
00:59:12,816 --> 00:59:13,916
I mean, you are
a perfectly good guy.

1410
00:59:13,918 --> 00:59:15,017
You're very honest and nice.

1411
00:59:15,019 --> 00:59:17,619
Why does my dad
have your phone number?

1412
00:59:17,621 --> 00:59:20,188
I don't know.
Maybe the school
directory or something.

1413
00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:21,557
Let's do something...

1414
00:59:21,559 --> 00:59:22,424
Let's do something
that would distract us.

1415
00:59:22,426 --> 00:59:24,059
Okay.

1416
00:59:24,061 --> 00:59:26,128
So we don't have to think
about him anymore.

1417
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:27,729
Mmm-mmm. Mmm-mmm.

1418
00:59:27,731 --> 00:59:28,971
All right. Um...

1420
00:59:32,669 --> 00:59:34,002
Is it okay if we just talk?

1421
00:59:36,205 --> 00:59:37,205
Okay.

1422
00:59:37,473 --> 00:59:39,508
Let's talk.

1423
00:59:39,510 --> 00:59:41,276
No way.
Yeah.

1424
00:59:41,278 --> 00:59:43,278
I was Peter Pan,
but then I was,
like, late.

1425

You're really close
with your brother, then.

It seems like.
Yeah.

1427
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:49,284

You're a fucking genius, dude.

Are you sure it's
not too much, though?
No!

<i>Yeah!
Fuck, yeah!</i>

1432
00:59:59,597 --> 01:00:01,897
All right? All right?
Yeah. Yeah.

1433
01:00:01,899 --> 01:00:03,332
All night, bro.
Come on. All night.
Yeah, I know.

1434
01:00:03,334 --> 01:00:04,800
It's gonna be so worth it, dude.

1435

It's gonna be
fucking worth it,
I promise, all right?

MAYA: I can't believe we've
been talking all night.

Oh, my God, it's 8:00.

I'll see you later.

Best night ever.

Like, the longest amount
of time you could think of
right now.

1455
01:00:47,277 --> 01:00:48,677
This stuff wasn't meant for you.

1456
01:00:48,679 --> 01:00:50,245
It was meant to be private.

1457
01:00:50,247 --> 01:00:52,781
So, am I supposed
to just sit here
and not act like

1458
01:00:52,783 --> 01:00:55,017
I hear every one
of your problems?

1459
01:00:55,019 --> 01:00:58,387
You got 99 problems,
but being young isn't one.

01:00:58,389 --> 01:01:01,757
You're just jealous
because Maya and I
have a real connection.

1461
01:01:01,759 --> 01:01:03,258
I'm pretty close
with my grandpa, too.

1462
01:01:04,961 --> 01:01:06,461
You're more messed up
than Cynthia was,

1463
01:01:06,463 --> 01:01:08,697
and she went to
the school shrink
three times a week.

1464
01:01:08,699 --> 01:01:10,866
Why?
I don't know.

1465
01:01:10,868 --> 01:01:12,701
But he gave her
a ton of pills
and shit.

1466
01:01:12,703 --> 01:01:15,103
Maybe he could
give you something
for your weird old face.

Hey.
You're late.

No, actually,
I was busy with
the investigation.

This is Cynthia's

This is our investigation.

(WHISPERING) All right.

You're an amazing doctor.

you're the first partners

only to try to run
when you're first faced
with talking with me?

we were partners?

(WHISPERING) I suspect
you're partners.

that requires constant work.

we learned in high school.

So you are
high school sweethearts.

I just feel like sometimes

1496
01:02:34,518 --> 01:02:36,017
he's not even trying anymore.

1497
01:02:36,019 --> 01:02:38,386
Like this isn't
even worth saving.

1498
01:02:38,388 --> 01:02:39,721
JENKO: Oh, okay.
Well, sometimes
I feel like

1499
01:02:39,723 --> 01:02:41,356
that we should be
more like the yangs.

1500

Or maybe I should be more
like your beautiful zook.

That's a lot of fucking.
Oh, my God.

1504

Sometimes I like to
have the participants
make physical contact.

1505
01:02:52,202 --> 01:02:53,602
Why don't you hold hands?

1506
01:02:53,604 --> 01:02:55,003
Okay.
I'm not doing that.

1507
01:02:55,005 --> 01:02:56,872
Hmm?

1508
01:02:56,874 --> 01:02:58,039
Reach out your hand.

1510
01:02:59,543 --> 01:03:01,343
He's literally
reaching out for you.

1511
01:03:01,345 --> 01:03:02,444
He won't hold my hand.

1513
01:03:03,614 --> 01:03:05,013
I kind of need you to do it.

1514
01:03:05,015 --> 01:03:06,848
He won't hold my hand.
Oh, you...

1515
01:03:06,850 --> 01:03:08,316
You got to interlock it, though.

1516
01:03:08,318 --> 01:03:09,684
If you don't interlock it,
it's not hand-holding.

1517
01:03:09,686 --> 01:03:11,253
Fine.

1518
01:03:11,255 --> 01:03:12,420
We might as well just be friends

1519
01:03:12,422 --> 01:03:13,455
and not partners.

1520
01:03:13,457 --> 01:03:14,457
Nice, right?

1521
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:17,392
Okay, you see this?
This is strong.

1522
01:03:17,394 --> 01:03:19,628
What I want to be
able to have is this.

1523
01:03:19,630 --> 01:03:22,297
Is this...

1524
01:03:22,299 --> 01:03:26,101
I want to be
able to have that,
that same thing, in, like

1525
01:03:26,103 --> 01:03:28,270
without actually
having to do it.

1526
01:03:28,272 --> 01:03:29,471
Are you embarrassed
of your partner?

1527
01:03:29,473 --> 01:03:30,906
No, not at all. Okay?

1528
01:03:30,908 --> 01:03:32,674
And why the fuck
are you guys
ganging up on me?

1529
01:03:32,676 --> 01:03:33,875
Gang up on him.
Okay, seriously.

1530
01:03:33,877 --> 01:03:35,644
Okay, okay.
He's clingy.

1531
01:03:35,646 --> 01:03:37,913
He literally is terrified
of being by himself.

1532
01:03:37,915 --> 01:03:39,514
Look, I know zook's your buddy

1533
01:03:39,516 --> 01:03:40,415
and you don't
want him to be guilty,

1534
01:03:40,417 --> 01:03:41,883
but he's our guy.

1535
01:03:41,885 --> 01:03:43,819
No, he's actually
not our guy.
I would know.

1536
01:03:43,821 --> 01:03:46,354
Now, you know,
we sometimes cling to things

1537
01:03:46,356 --> 01:03:48,456
because they're
familiar and comfortable.

1538
01:03:48,458 --> 01:03:50,192
I teach about
a principle called embedding.

1539
01:03:50,194 --> 01:03:51,726
Look at the facts.
Matter of fact, I...

1540
01:03:51,728 --> 01:03:54,296
Zook has the tattoo.
He knew Cynthia.

1541
01:03:54,298 --> 01:03:55,597
I know the first time
he met you,

1542
01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:56,898
you dropped a fucking
sandwich on his foot

1543
01:03:56,900 --> 01:03:58,300
and he smiled at you,

1544
01:03:58,302 --> 01:04:01,369
but you are completely
blind to the fact...

1545
01:04:01,371 --> 01:04:03,305
What'd you say
embedding was?
Embedding?

1546
01:04:03,307 --> 01:04:06,775
Oh, embedding
is our tendency
to latch on to

1547
01:04:06,777 --> 01:04:09,277
the first bit
of information
that we're offered

1548
01:04:09,279 --> 01:04:11,913
and overlooking,
or even ignoring,
contradictory information.

1549
01:04:11,915 --> 01:04:12,814
It's a fascinating principle...

1550
01:04:12,816 --> 01:04:14,583
Shut up. I'm thinking.

1551
01:04:15,651 --> 01:04:17,953
You think it's possible that

1552
01:04:17,955 --> 01:04:19,788
we embedded?

1553
01:04:19,790 --> 01:04:21,423
What, like when we were
drunk or something?

1554
01:04:21,425 --> 01:04:23,325
We embedded
each other?

getting in position

Oh. Oh.
Oh, my God.

2170
01:30:53,849 --> 01:30:55,415
Is there blood in my eye?
Oh, my God.
Are you all right?

2171
01:30:55,417 --> 01:30:56,850
I think there's blood in my eye.

No! No!
What?

2178
01:31:09,965 --> 01:31:11,898
What were you doing?
What am I doing?

2179
01:31:11,900 --> 01:31:13,166
Why'd you try to kiss me?

2180
01:31:13,168 --> 01:31:14,334
I didn't fucking
try and kiss you!

2181
01:31:14,336 --> 01:31:16,536
Yes, you did.
Ooh, you're so weird!

2182
01:31:16,538 --> 01:31:18,371
You're fucking
Mr. and Mrs. Smith-ing me.

2183
01:31:18,373 --> 01:31:19,873
I'm not
Mr. and Mrs. Smith-ing you.

2184
01:31:19,875 --> 01:31:21,241
This wasn't a sexy fight.

2185
01:31:21,243 --> 01:31:23,543
Oh, like you haven't
wanted to kiss me
the whole time.

2186
01:31:23,545 --> 01:31:25,879
I never once wanted to kiss you!

2187
01:31:25,881 --> 01:31:27,747
Never! No!

2188
01:31:27,749 --> 01:31:28,849
You just did it again!
Stop it!
Stop!

2189
01:31:28,851 --> 01:31:30,383
You're making a face
that is sexy!

2190
01:31:30,385 --> 01:31:32,185
I don't even want to kiss you!

2191
01:31:32,187 --> 01:31:33,553
Then stop trying!

2192
01:31:33,555 --> 01:31:34,988
You keep trying!

2193
01:31:34,990 --> 01:31:36,623
I've never tried to kiss you.

2194
01:31:36,625 --> 01:31:37,557
You gave me kiss me eyes.

2195
01:31:37,559 --> 01:31:38,959
No, I didn't.

2196
01:31:38,961 --> 01:31:40,794
The eyes were
I just got punched
in the face eyes.

2197
01:31:40,796 --> 01:31:42,062
They weren't kiss me eyes.

2198
01:31:42,064 --> 01:31:43,296
I don't even like you!

2199
01:31:43,298 --> 01:31:45,065
Neither do I,
so stop kissing me!

2200

Okay!

No! You're leaning
in again!

I didn't know
if we were gonna
punch or kiss!

2203
01:31:50,739 --> 01:31:52,239
You're making this
so uncomfortable.

2204
01:31:52,241 --> 01:31:55,108
This is the most
uncomfortable fistfight
I've ever been in.

2205
01:31:55,110 --> 01:31:56,643
I'm gonna give you
an out by punching
you in the face.

01:31:56,645 --> 01:31:58,111
Okay?
Okay.

2207
01:31:58,113 --> 01:31:59,813
And then we're gonna
go back to fighting

2208

and we'll pretend
this never happened,

How about this?
You want a little fun?

01:38:31,639 --> 01:38:33,907
I just realized something.

2329
01:38:33,909 --> 01:38:35,842
You don't hold me down, man.

2330

2335
01:38:44,986 --> 01:38:47,420
You're dragging me down.
You're really heavy.

2336
01:38:47,422 --> 01:38:49,455
Hey, listen, there's
a grenade in my shorts.

Can you reach it?

2338
01:38:50,692 --> 01:38:52,358
You gotta go in from underneath.

I miss you, too.

and I was clenching you
in my fist.

I tried to soil myself and,
