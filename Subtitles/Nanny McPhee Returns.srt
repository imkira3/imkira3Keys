so whomever you've come to look after,
it certainly isn't us.

{SCOFFING} I'd rather share with a goat.

Aunt Isabel's son.

1107
01:08:42,392 --> 01:08:45,263
Ah, yes, the girl who made
that unfortunate marriage.

1108
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:47,762
Her happy marriage to my father, sir,

1109
01:08:47,856 --> 01:08:51,806
who's fighting for your army,
so I'll thank you to be more civil.

1110
01:09:02,954 --> 01:09:05,362
And what is your business here, pray?

1111
01:09:07,917 --> 01:09:11,867
Sir, we need you to find out
what's happened to Norman's father.

1112
01:09:13,131 --> 01:09:14,708
To Uncle Rory.

1113
01:09:15,175 --> 01:09:17,297
We got a telegram saying...

1114
01:09:19,929 --> 01:09:20,960
Yes?

1115
01:09:22,682 --> 01:09:24,805
...he was killed in action.

1116
01:09:24,892 --> 01:09:27,348
But I know it's wrong. I know he's alive.

1117
01:09:27,812 --> 01:09:30,564
I see. So, you're saying that the telegram,

1118
01:09:30,648 --> 01:09:34,646
a telegram sent from the War Office,
contained false information?

1119
01:09:35,069 --> 01:09:36,148
Exactly.

1120
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:37,400
And you have proof, of course,

1121
01:09:37,488 --> 01:09:39,232
otherwise you would not have dared
to come here.

1122
01:09:40,867 --> 01:09:44,699
Has your father contacted you
since you received the telegram?

1123
01:09:46,038 --> 01:09:47,070
No.

1124
01:09:47,790 --> 01:09:51,040
Then one of his unit
has been in touch, presumably?

1125
01:09:54,255 --> 01:09:55,286
No.

1126
01:09:56,549 --> 01:09:58,541
Then what proof have you?

1127
01:10:00,136 --> 01:10:02,128
I can feel it in my bones.

1128
01:10:02,930 --> 01:10:06,513
- In your what? What?
- I can feel it in my bones.

1129
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:08,807
In your bones?

1130
01:10:08,894 --> 01:10:10,768
Feel it in your bones?

1131
01:10:12,690 --> 01:10:14,978
- Yes.
- Great heavens, boy.

1132
01:10:15,067 --> 01:10:17,523
Do you mean you've persuaded
my weak-willed son

1133
01:10:17,611 --> 01:10:20,861
to bring you here, in the middle of a war,

1134
01:10:20,948 --> 01:10:25,740
with some cock-and-bull story
about a feeling you have in your bones?

1135
01:10:25,828 --> 01:10:27,619
He's not weak-willed.

1136
01:10:27,705 --> 01:10:29,496
It was him who saved the piglets

1137
01:10:29,581 --> 01:10:32,535
and him that thought of helping us
by coming here.

1138
01:10:32,626 --> 01:10:34,666
And I know I'm right about my father.

1139
01:10:34,753 --> 01:10:37,423
Please, can't you just inquire?

1140
01:10:41,552 --> 01:10:45,881
There are thousands of men
fighting in my army.

1141
01:10:45,973 --> 01:10:49,092
Why should I give your father,
however worthy he may be,

1142
01:10:49,184 --> 01:10:50,975
my special attention?

1143
01:10:54,356 --> 01:10:55,684
Because...

1144
01:10:57,025 --> 01:10:59,979
Because they love him,
and so does Auntie Isabel,

1145
01:11:00,070 --> 01:11:01,612
and they need him.

1146
01:11:02,072 --> 01:11:04,444
And I know why you sent us away
to them, too.

1147
01:11:04,783 --> 01:11:06,491
It had nothing to do with bombs.

1148
01:11:07,202 --> 01:11:08,744
I know you and Mother are getting a divorce.

1149
01:11:08,829 --> 01:11:11,865
- Enough!
- No, you will listen!

1150
01:11:11,957 --> 01:11:14,364
You've made your lives
and our lives a misery.

1151
01:11:14,459 --> 01:11:16,452
Isn't that enough for you?

1152
01:11:19,923 --> 01:11:22,793
At least help Aunt Isabel and Uncle Rory
to be together.

The telegram you received was incorrect.

In fact, there's no record of any telegram
having been sent.

Norman, if the War Office
never sent that telegram,

1197
01:15:19,034 --> 01:15:21,323
it means the one you saw was forged,

1198
01:15:21,411 --> 01:15:24,827
but who would forge a telegram
saying someone was dead?

1199
01:15:24,915 --> 01:15:27,370
- Who would do something that awful?
- Uncle Phil.

1200
01:15:27,459 --> 01:15:30,164
He's been trying to get Mum
to sell our half of the farm.

1201
01:15:30,254 --> 01:15:33,089
He must have known she'd sell
if she thought Dad was dead.
