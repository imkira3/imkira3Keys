00:01:39,209 --> 00:01:40,112
Dude!

3
00:01:47,012 --> 00:01:50,081
Yeah, don't get up. I got it, bro.

4
00:01:55,886 --> 00:02:00,326
Damn, Finn.
This must be your best one yet.

5
00:02:00,426 --> 00:02:03,729
How long you been workin' on this?
Like two, three weeks?

6
00:02:03,829 --> 00:02:05,857
Fuck off. Okay? I don't go to the bar

7
00:02:05,957 --> 00:02:09,265
and complain when it takes you
10 minutes to make a martini.

8
00:02:09,368 --> 00:02:11,970
I'm perfectly happy with where I'm at.

9
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:14,484
I just hit a little creative block.
That's all.

10
00:02:15,874 --> 00:02:17,558
Hello?

11
00:02:17,658 --> 00:02:20,078
Oh, hi, Mrs. Anderson.

12
00:02:20,178 --> 00:02:23,682
Why, yes. The building manager's
right here.

13
00:02:23,782 --> 00:02:27,412
Oh, I'm sure he'd be delighted
to come over and fix your toilet.

14
00:02:28,087 --> 00:02:32,832
Yeah. He's givin' me the thumbs up
right now. He'll be over in a second.

15
00:02:35,193 --> 00:02:37,062
You were saying something, right?

16
00:02:37,162 --> 00:02:39,966
About you being perfectly happy
with where you're at in life?

17
00:03:09,061 --> 00:03:11,111
Hello.

18
00:03:12,364 --> 00:03:16,068
Well, he said he was thinking
of going to art school.

19
00:03:16,168 --> 00:03:18,871
And I said, "Oh, what a coincidence!

20
00:03:18,971 --> 00:03:22,809
Our building manager
used to be a painter."

21
00:03:22,909 --> 00:03:25,912
When you're 18,
everybody wants to be an artist.

22
00:03:33,076 --> 00:03:36,054
- Where did you get that?
- Garage sale.

23
00:03:36,454 --> 00:03:37,990
So weird.

24
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:39,825
I'm seeing...

25
00:03:40,325 --> 00:03:43,395
I'm seeing... seashells.

26
00:03:43,495 --> 00:03:48,801
Outlaw, Rambling Rose, Crab Apple.

27
00:03:48,901 --> 00:03:51,704
- Crabs live in the fucking ocean, right?
- Yes, they do.

28
00:03:51,804 --> 00:03:54,873
Crab Apple. I'm betting on Crab Apple.

29
00:03:55,808 --> 00:03:58,544
Hello, my lost boys.

30
00:04:00,012 --> 00:04:01,705
- New sweater.
- New for me.

31
00:04:01,805 --> 00:04:03,682
It's a thrift store find. You like it?

32
00:04:03,782 --> 00:04:08,087
Oh, I had a little left over,
so I got these for you, babe.

33
00:04:09,254 --> 00:04:11,757
It's the right kind. Camel hair, right?

34
00:04:12,157 --> 00:04:14,052
Thank you. Did you get a new journal?

35
00:04:14,152 --> 00:04:18,296
I knew how much you wanted them,
so I couldn't resist.

36
00:04:21,433 --> 00:04:26,138
Okay, I'm going to go start dinner.
Do you guys want your favorite, lasagna?

37
00:05:43,047 --> 00:05:45,235
Need some help?

38
00:05:45,884 --> 00:05:49,531
Hey, Big Joe. Yes, I do. Thank you.

39
00:05:54,793 --> 00:05:57,496
<i>- Eight is really gettin' taken...</i>
- Come on. Come on.

40
00:05:57,896 --> 00:06:00,733
Come on. That's it. That's it. Come on.

41
00:06:01,033 --> 00:06:05,003
You got this.
Keep fuckin' running. Let's go.

42
00:06:05,103 --> 00:06:07,272
Come on. Come on.

43
00:06:07,372 --> 00:06:10,475
- What's up?
- Hey, Big Ben.

44
00:06:10,575 --> 00:06:12,975
- Come on.
- It's Joe.

45
00:06:13,075 --> 00:06:16,882
Crab Apple. Crab Apple.
Come on, you little bastard! Run!

46
00:06:17,232 --> 00:06:21,636
Come on! Run! Come on! Fuck, man!

47
00:06:21,936 --> 00:06:24,006
Chill out.

48
00:06:27,209 --> 00:06:30,913
Hey, Finn, the landlord called.
Mr. Bezzerides's rent is late.

49
00:06:31,613 --> 00:06:33,615
Maybe he fell, and he can't get up.

50
00:06:34,489 --> 00:06:36,385
He's been late before.

51
00:06:36,485 --> 00:06:38,153
- Oh, the man across the way?
- Yeah.

52
00:06:38,253 --> 00:06:42,057
I noticed a couple
of parking tickets on his car.

53
00:06:42,157 --> 00:06:44,092
I guess he's got a couple
parking tickets on his car,

54
00:06:44,192 --> 00:06:46,461
so maybe we should check on him.

55
00:06:46,561 --> 00:06:49,231
And I also invited Big Joe
to stop by the party.

56
00:06:49,331 --> 00:06:53,101
Okay, but I hope he doesn't wear
that tacky rent-a-cop uniform.

57
00:06:53,201 --> 00:06:55,470
I thought we were just
inviting close friends.

58
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:58,607
Yeah, well, Big Joe's really cool.

59
00:06:58,707 --> 00:07:01,944
And he's helping me with the chairs.
He's standing here right now.

60
00:07:06,448 --> 00:07:08,450
Don't worry. I own other outfits.

61
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:11,153
I'm sorry.

62
00:07:11,253 --> 00:07:16,325
I'm just gonna... go check
on Mr. Bezzerides. Okay then.

63
00:07:34,809 --> 00:07:37,813
Hey, Mr. Bezzerides, are you home?

64
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,022
Everyone's kinda worried about you,

65
00:07:47,122 --> 00:07:50,358
so I'm going to go ahead
and come inside, okay?

66
00:08:04,706 --> 00:08:07,184
Mr. Bezzerides?

67
00:08:35,036 --> 00:08:36,538
It was a sure thing.

68
00:08:36,638 --> 00:08:39,958
No, it obviously wasn't a sure thing.
He lost, Jasper.

69
00:08:40,058 --> 00:08:42,978
No, he was a sure thing
up until the moment he lost.

70
00:08:43,078 --> 00:08:46,397
That makes zero sense.

71
00:09:00,094 --> 00:09:02,298
What the fuck?

72
00:09:05,233 --> 00:09:07,969
These are shots of our living room.

73
00:09:09,237 --> 00:09:11,506
Mr. "Bitch-arabies" is a peeping tom.

74
00:09:11,606 --> 00:09:16,144
Yeah, I though that, too, but why
take photos of our empty living room?

75
00:09:19,514 --> 00:09:23,342
Looks like he saved the best ones
for his private collection.

76
00:09:25,854 --> 00:09:27,856
What is this thing?

77
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,747
I think it's a camera. See?

78
00:09:36,431 --> 00:09:38,300
Cripes.

79
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,302
You think he got enough film?

80
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,876
What? Do I even want to know?

81
00:09:48,076 --> 00:09:50,879
When did we knock over the coat rack?

82
00:09:50,979 --> 00:09:55,083
Maybe it was that night we played
drunk charades. You remember.

83
00:09:55,183 --> 00:09:59,020
No, he doesn't remember
'cause he passed out on the couch.

84
00:10:00,288 --> 00:10:03,825
Well, I guess this explains the green light
we see over here sometimes.

85
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:06,228
Yeah, but why is this thing
bolted to the floor?

86
00:10:07,595 --> 00:10:11,233
I don't know, but I don't like it.
I don't like the sound it's making either.

87
00:10:12,233 --> 00:10:14,703
Or how about the half-naked photos
of me on the wall?

88
00:10:14,903 --> 00:10:17,939
That's the one thing I do like
about this situation.

89
00:10:24,579 --> 00:10:26,965
I knew something wasn't right
about that old man.

90
00:10:27,165 --> 00:10:29,301
Hi, Mr. Kendall, this is Finn
from Sycamore Apartments.

91
00:10:29,401 --> 00:10:32,036
I'm calling you back
about Mr. Bezzerides.

92
00:10:32,136 --> 00:10:36,416
If you can please ring me when you get
a chance, that would be great. Thank you.

93
00:10:36,516 --> 00:10:38,978
- What did the landlord say?
- I just left a voice mail.

94
00:10:40,845 --> 00:10:43,682
Okay. I'm off to work.

95
00:10:43,782 --> 00:10:47,786
I counted the cookies, so if any go missing,
there will be murder in this apartment.

96
00:10:47,886 --> 00:10:51,056
- I'll guard 'em.
- Who's going to guard 'em from you?

97
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,043
It's a perfect match.

98
00:11:12,143 --> 00:11:15,680
- It's got to be a coincidence.
- Maybe. Or...

99
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:19,004
Or what? The camera
took a picture ahead of time?

100
00:11:19,104 --> 00:11:22,454
- Give me a break.
- I mean, just look at it.

101
00:11:22,554 --> 00:11:24,489
The placement of everything, my canvass.

102
00:11:24,589 --> 00:11:27,530
Your canvass has looked
like that for months.

103
00:11:28,616 --> 00:11:29,496
Hey, guys...

104
00:11:47,378 --> 00:11:48,747
No way.

105
00:11:51,049 --> 00:11:52,818
Oh, my God.

106
00:11:59,591 --> 00:12:03,161
This was last Wednesday. Remember
you broke the mug with your four-iron?

107
00:12:03,261 --> 00:12:05,264
Oh, yeah, right.

108
00:12:06,198 --> 00:12:09,468
Thursday. Friday we went to the movies.

109
00:12:09,568 --> 00:12:13,305
Saturday we lost power, used candles.

110
00:12:13,405 --> 00:12:14,706
Sunday.

111
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,807
Monday.

112
00:12:17,441 --> 00:12:19,945
That's tonight, Tuesday.

113
00:12:22,046 --> 00:12:24,092
Tomorrow.

114
00:12:26,317 --> 00:12:27,485
Bullshit.

115
00:12:27,785 --> 00:12:31,990
Mr. "B" invented a camera
that takes pictures of the future,

116
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:34,893
and he only used it
to look in our apartment?

117
00:12:34,993 --> 00:12:37,829
- Doesn't make any sense.
- Well, maybe he's testing it.

118
00:12:38,029 --> 00:12:40,165
Yeah, and this thing
isn't exactly portable.

119
00:12:40,565 --> 00:12:43,211
Well, he's a scientist, so there's
got to be some sort of logs

120
00:12:43,311 --> 00:12:45,743
or documentation somewhere.
Just start looking.

121
00:12:45,843 --> 00:12:47,772
Will you guys listen to yourselves?

122
00:12:48,372 --> 00:12:50,442
All right. Come on out, Mr. "B."

123
00:12:50,542 --> 00:12:54,045
I know you're fucking in here in the walls
or something, laughing your ass off!

124
00:12:54,145 --> 00:12:57,282
All right, the jig's up!
Come on out, asshole!

125
00:12:57,382 --> 00:12:59,584
I don't think he's going to answer.

126
00:12:59,984 --> 00:13:02,254
- Why?
- "November 27.

127
00:13:02,554 --> 00:13:04,789
Results today: positive function.

128
00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:07,258
The machine continues to work perfectly.

129
00:13:07,358 --> 00:13:11,763
However, I've seen something in the future
that is disturbing to my core.

130
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:14,999
I believe I've seen my death.

131
00:13:17,001 --> 00:13:19,804
I know the cardinal rule
of time and causality...

132
00:13:19,904 --> 00:13:22,807
is that one should not attempt
to change the future.

133
00:13:23,107 --> 00:13:27,312
But under these circumstances,
it seems to be a risk worth taking.

134
00:13:27,612 --> 00:13:29,381
If I believed in God,

135
00:13:29,481 --> 00:13:33,952
I would pray today that no greater harm
will come from what I'm about to do."

136
00:13:36,454 --> 00:13:38,590
Then what?

137
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:41,926
Nothing. That's the last entry,
a week ago today.

138
00:13:42,326 --> 00:13:43,995
A week ago.

139
00:13:44,095 --> 00:13:48,466
Seven photos. That means it was
kicking it out after he disappeared.

140
00:13:48,566 --> 00:13:51,069
So it must be on a timer.

141
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,475
8:00 pm.

142
00:13:58,376 --> 00:14:00,645
Then why are there so many daytime ones?

143
00:14:00,745 --> 00:14:03,749
Maybe it's only been taking ones
at night for the last week.

144
00:14:05,617 --> 00:14:06,985
All right.

145
00:14:07,085 --> 00:14:10,655
Even I have to admit this photo
is a little fucking unsettling.

146
00:14:18,363 --> 00:14:20,399
I think I know where he might be.

147
00:14:28,473 --> 00:14:32,110
- Christ. What's he keeping in here?
- I don't know.

148
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:35,146
Him and the previous manager
added this door years ago.

149
00:14:35,246 --> 00:14:37,448
God, please, oh, please,
don't let him be in there.

150
00:14:37,548 --> 00:14:40,352
There's no way. If there was a dead body
in there, we'd be able to smell it.

151
00:14:40,452 --> 00:14:44,190
- Oh, God.
- What? Is he in there?

152
00:14:51,396 --> 00:14:54,186
Oh, my God. Close it, close it.

153
00:14:55,667 --> 00:14:59,437
What happened to him?
It looked like he was burned.

154
00:14:59,737 --> 00:15:01,573
Yeah, I don't know about that.

155
00:15:01,673 --> 00:15:04,342
I mean, did you see his suit?
It was fine. It wasn't even touched.

156
00:15:04,442 --> 00:15:07,512
Isn't it obvious?
I mean, you read his journal.

157
00:15:07,612 --> 00:15:09,214
He broke the cardinal rule.

158
00:15:10,148 --> 00:15:12,717
You don't fuck with time.

159
00:15:30,802 --> 00:15:33,805
Jasper, please take his hat off.

160
00:15:34,372 --> 00:15:36,674
It's my thinking cap.

161
00:15:38,409 --> 00:15:41,746
What the hell is there to think about?
We need to call the police, guys.

162
00:15:41,846 --> 00:15:44,516
Hang on. That could be a big mistake.

163
00:15:45,216 --> 00:15:46,229
What do you mean?

164
00:15:46,329 --> 00:15:49,587
I mean, we just discovered
a fucking time-traveling camera!

165
00:15:49,687 --> 00:15:51,255
We need to consider the possibilities.

166
00:15:51,755 --> 00:15:55,660
Well, one possibility is we've all been
dosed with lethal amounts of radiation

167
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,196
that... you know,
could've killed Mr. "B."

168
00:15:59,096 --> 00:16:03,205
Okay, Negative Nancy, but...
what if we could use this thing?

169
00:16:04,402 --> 00:16:05,470
How?

170
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:09,640
Remember how Mr. "B" took a photo
of himself holding that sign?

171
00:16:11,325 --> 00:16:16,080
What if we put up,
like... the newspaper?

172
00:16:16,414 --> 00:16:19,272
- We would know what happens in the future.
- Yeah, the newspaper, Jasper?

173
00:16:19,572 --> 00:16:20,977
What are you thinking?
Arts and Entertainment?

174
00:16:21,077 --> 00:16:23,656
Or are you thinking the race results?

175
00:16:24,255 --> 00:16:27,659
Well, what if? I mean, think about
how much money we could make.

176
00:16:29,193 --> 00:16:30,412
Callie...

177
00:16:31,012 --> 00:16:34,450
I foretell that tonight
is your last night waiting tables.

178
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:38,503
And instead, you can pursue
writing full time.

179
00:16:40,104 --> 00:16:42,040
Callie?

180
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:48,546
No! Absolutely not!
We're go... We're calling the police.

181
00:16:48,846 --> 00:16:52,924
Finn, I foretell that you live the rest
of your life in pathetic obscurity

182
00:16:53,024 --> 00:16:54,853
and die penniless and insane.

183
00:16:56,287 --> 00:16:59,390
- I'm serious, Jasper.
- So am I.

184
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:01,058
Does it look like the cops are here?

185
00:17:01,358 --> 00:17:04,529
That people are buzzing about
the charred corpse in the storage unit?

186
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:06,164
Everything looks fine.

187
00:17:06,844 --> 00:17:09,400
Look, if we reported it, we probably
wouldn't have had the party anyway.

188
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,717
We'd have canceled it altogether.

189
00:17:11,817 --> 00:17:14,972
We can't cancel it. It's Dave
and Sharon's engagement party.

190
00:17:15,072 --> 00:17:19,277
That's what I'm saying.
Obviously, we don't report it tonight.

191
00:17:20,645 --> 00:17:24,716
There is a dead fucking st...
rotting corpse in the storage unit.

192
00:17:24,816 --> 00:17:27,251
You can't smell anything as long
as we keep the door closed.

193
00:17:28,786 --> 00:17:31,990
It's been down there a week.
What's one more day?

194
00:17:34,725 --> 00:17:36,327
Look.

195
00:17:36,427 --> 00:17:39,664
We let the party happen,
we look at tomorrow's photo, and...

196
00:17:39,964 --> 00:17:45,404
if it shows the cops taking our testimony
and shit, I'll call 'em myself.

197
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:53,348
I have to admit. I am kind of curious
to see one more photo.

198
00:17:57,615 --> 00:18:00,697
All right. Fine. One day. But...

199
00:18:01,349 --> 00:18:02,958
One day.

200
00:18:18,602 --> 00:18:21,006
- What time is it?
- Twenty till.

201
00:18:26,978 --> 00:18:30,981
Well, just in case tomorrow's photo
shows the end of the world...

202
00:18:31,514 --> 00:18:33,519
I'm going to enjoy myself.

203
00:18:41,959 --> 00:18:44,026
Do you want to dance?

204
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:49,334
And he adopts
his classic glazed-over look.

205
00:18:50,134 --> 00:18:52,018
What?

206
00:20:05,343 --> 00:20:07,879
You son of a bitch.

207
00:20:31,703 --> 00:20:34,022
Guys! Guys!

208
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:39,911
- I'm a fucking genius.
- I know, but look at that painting.

209
00:20:40,011 --> 00:20:41,479
Holy shit!

210
00:20:41,579 --> 00:20:44,315
I know. I mean, the camera
sees my work before I do it.

211
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:47,818
It's just incredible. I don't have
to be blocked anymore!

212
00:20:50,621 --> 00:20:52,448
I'm in.

213
00:20:53,223 --> 00:20:54,926
Yes!

214
00:20:55,026 --> 00:20:56,914
Yes.

215
00:21:17,415 --> 00:21:20,718
You're up early. What time is it?

216
00:21:20,918 --> 00:21:24,623
How about we start with what year is it?

217
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:28,960
Oh, so you can write
in a dead man's journal,

218
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:31,229
but I'm not allowed to wear his hat?

219
00:21:31,529 --> 00:21:33,331
This isn't poetry, Jasper.

220
00:21:33,731 --> 00:21:35,566
I'm making our to-do list.

221
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:37,221
If we're really going through with this,

222
00:21:37,321 --> 00:21:40,205
we need to start making it look
like Mr. B's still around.

223
00:21:41,172 --> 00:21:43,407
I mean, this is actually happening?

224
00:21:43,507 --> 00:21:48,079
What are you talking about, bro?
It already happened. It's done.

225
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:50,115
Well, I mean, we could
just not go through with it.

226
00:21:51,482 --> 00:21:54,152
Actually, I think we have to.

227
00:21:56,053 --> 00:22:00,260
If I understand this correctly,
this is how it works.

228
00:22:01,258 --> 00:22:04,896
The camera spits out a photo
of us in the future.

229
00:22:04,996 --> 00:22:07,371
Then we go about our day
making a series of decisions

230
00:22:07,471 --> 00:22:09,413
that lead up until that moment.

231
00:22:09,817 --> 00:22:11,020
But...

232
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:15,873
if we deviate from those decisions,
then this photo never happened.

233
00:22:15,973 --> 00:22:20,845
Which means "us," the people who saw
the original photo, can't go forward.

234
00:22:21,345 --> 00:22:23,447
Because our futures don't exist anymore.

235
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,285
What do you mean "can't go forward"?

236
00:22:33,624 --> 00:22:36,761
I mean, are we 100% sure
that's how he died?

237
00:22:37,161 --> 00:22:41,199
No, but... do you really want
to test it and find out?

238
00:22:44,101 --> 00:22:46,704
So it's agreed then.

239
00:22:46,804 --> 00:22:49,439
We got to do what's in the photo.

240
00:22:50,966 --> 00:22:53,544
Okay, all right, fine.

241
00:22:53,811 --> 00:22:56,180
We have to do this tonight.

242
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:59,016
But we're talking about
not reporting a dead body.

243
00:22:59,116 --> 00:23:02,854
I'm pretty sure if anybody found out,
Jasper, that's jail time.

244
00:23:02,954 --> 00:23:04,882
Okay, but nobody's going to find out.

245
00:23:05,422 --> 00:23:07,425
I was over there this morning
to make a list.

246
00:23:07,525 --> 00:23:11,779
All we have to do is bring in
his newspapers, water the plants.

247
00:23:11,879 --> 00:23:15,532
We should probably move his car
so it doesn't get any more tickets.

248
00:23:15,705 --> 00:23:17,702
I found a couple pieces of mail.

249
00:23:17,802 --> 00:23:21,172
Maybe a couple bills,
so I should probably post them.

250
00:23:24,642 --> 00:23:26,240
Well, you seem to have everything
figured out.

251
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,880
Dude. Just relax, man.

252
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:32,651
The risk is so minimal,
it's almost nonexistent.

253
00:23:33,851 --> 00:23:37,184
All we have to do is make sure
that storage unit door stays closed,

254
00:23:37,284 --> 00:23:41,459
and... we become rich.

255
00:23:44,628 --> 00:23:46,097
And you get your paintings.

256
00:23:51,435 --> 00:23:53,238
Yeah.

257
00:24:27,705 --> 00:24:30,975
Come on. Come on. Come on, Bobcat!

258
00:24:31,075 --> 00:24:34,579
Fuck, yes! Fuck, yes!

259
00:25:32,703 --> 00:25:34,806
All right, let's go. It's almost 8:00.

260
00:25:34,906 --> 00:25:38,262
Wait. Do we have to be exactly as we were?
I don't want to change anything.

261
00:25:38,362 --> 00:25:40,308
I don't know. Is this right?

262
00:25:40,408 --> 00:25:42,479
Just smile and say good-bye
to your day jobs, guys.

263
00:25:42,579 --> 00:25:44,349
I mean, we can check the photo.
It's right there.

264
00:26:42,173 --> 00:26:44,908
<i>Henry? Henry, are you there?</i>

265
00:26:45,008 --> 00:26:49,013
<i>It's Joyce. I received your letter.</i>

266
00:26:49,113 --> 00:26:51,783
<i>Could you check in please
when you have time?</i>

267
00:26:52,983 --> 00:26:55,813
<i>I truly hope you're okay.</i>

268
00:27:04,962 --> 00:27:06,964
Hey, Finn!

269
00:27:10,534 --> 00:27:14,171
- Hey, Joe. How's it going?
- Hey, what's going on with the old man?

270
00:27:14,271 --> 00:27:16,640
I see Callie coming around here
in the mornings.

271
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,175
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

272
00:27:18,275 --> 00:27:20,395
He's sick in the hospital.
We just come by to water his plants

273
00:27:20,495 --> 00:27:22,046
and look after the place for him.

274
00:27:22,146 --> 00:27:24,348
Hospital? Is it serious?

275
00:27:25,873 --> 00:27:30,588
Yeah, it's pretty serious. They're still
trying to figure out what he has.

276
00:27:32,055 --> 00:27:35,159
Damn. It's good you guys
are looking after the place.

277
00:27:35,259 --> 00:27:39,107
Yeah. I mean, we don't mind, so...

278
00:27:39,207 --> 00:27:41,599
But I better get back to it.

279
00:27:52,643 --> 00:27:54,094
No, dude. We're over here tonight

280
00:27:54,194 --> 00:27:57,136
because we're not in the photo
from last night. It's that simple.

281
00:27:57,236 --> 00:28:00,645
Well, it's not like fate decided it. I mean,
presumably, we made decisions yesterday

282
00:28:00,745 --> 00:28:02,620
that made us end up here today.

283
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,790
All right, my brain just kinda melted
a bit. What was the original question?

284
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:08,766
The question is,
if you could choose something

285
00:28:08,866 --> 00:28:11,529
to show up in the next photo, anything,

286
00:28:11,629 --> 00:28:13,797
what would you choose to see?

287
00:28:14,397 --> 00:28:18,268
I'm a little ashamed at how good
it felt to buy this dress.

288
00:28:18,836 --> 00:28:21,071
Back to the question.

289
00:28:21,572 --> 00:28:22,973
Easy.

290
00:28:23,073 --> 00:28:26,610
I want a pile of money so big
that I'm fuckin' buried in it.

291
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:28,445
You are so predictable.

292
00:28:28,545 --> 00:28:33,584
Me? What about you?
We all know what you wanna see most.

293
00:28:33,784 --> 00:28:37,454
A rock. So you and Finn
don't have to keep living in sin.

294
00:28:37,554 --> 00:28:39,423
Whatever.

295
00:28:39,523 --> 00:28:40,558
- You hear that, Finn?
- What?

296
00:28:40,658 --> 00:28:41,826
You're off the hook.

297
00:28:41,926 --> 00:28:45,296
Oh, he's just daydreaming about
two paintings a day instead of one.

298
00:28:45,396 --> 00:28:48,920
Well, I don't know.
Just give a guy a second here.

299
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,142
I need to think.

300
00:28:52,203 --> 00:28:55,473
I never get tired of that sound.

301
00:29:08,986 --> 00:29:10,688
Finn.

302
00:29:35,979 --> 00:29:38,949
All right, come on, guys.
It's not like I want to do this.

303
00:29:39,349 --> 00:29:42,285
Okay, then let's not do it!

304
00:29:42,785 --> 00:29:45,356
Do I need to remind you about the roasted
dead guy in our basement?

305
00:29:49,626 --> 00:29:52,096
We got to do
what's in the photo, right, bro?

306
00:29:55,766 --> 00:29:57,101
How the hell did this happen?

307
00:29:59,496 --> 00:30:03,140
I don't know. Maybe it's a fucking dare.

308
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,077
- Maybe we're drunk.
- Maybe it was an accident.

309
00:30:06,477 --> 00:30:10,547
It's a fucking lip lock.
We didn't just bump into each other.

310
00:30:16,186 --> 00:30:18,730
Say something, Finn.

311
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:22,818
We should destroy that machine.

312
00:30:24,294 --> 00:30:28,004
What? We can't do that.

313
00:30:28,298 --> 00:30:30,187
I know.

314
00:30:31,542 --> 00:30:33,616
It's too late.

315
00:30:35,105 --> 00:30:36,673
It doesn't matter why we do this.

316
00:30:36,773 --> 00:30:38,776
For all intents and purposes,
it already happened.

317
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:43,584
I mean...

318
00:30:46,149 --> 00:30:48,485
I'm in the room.

319
00:30:48,885 --> 00:30:52,289
I don't look mad or pissed.

320
00:30:52,489 --> 00:30:54,357
The painting's coming out great.

321
00:30:54,457 --> 00:30:57,174
Yeah. The painting's coming out great.

322
00:30:57,274 --> 00:31:00,797
You probably asked us to do it
for inspiration or something.

323
00:31:04,434 --> 00:31:08,806
We're all friends. And we just need
to trust that it's going to be okay.

324
00:31:09,973 --> 00:31:12,543
Fuck! What the fuck was that for?

325
00:31:13,543 --> 00:31:15,313
That's for kissing
my girlfriend tomorrow.

326
00:31:27,458 --> 00:31:30,127
T-minus one hour,
in case you were wondering.

327
00:31:30,227 --> 00:31:34,064
Please, stop counting down
like it's a fucking shuttle launch.

328
00:31:34,898 --> 00:31:37,267
- Sorry.
- Yeah, yeah.

329
00:31:37,367 --> 00:31:38,924
Yeah, I told you
Crab Apple was a sure thing.

330
00:31:39,124 --> 00:31:40,861
He just needed a few more races.

331
00:31:40,961 --> 00:31:43,390
Yeah, let's roll half the winnings
into tomorrow's bets,

332
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:46,220
and I'll come pick up the rest.

333
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:50,981
Okay, yeah. Let me just
get something to write on.

334
00:32:01,992 --> 00:32:05,195
I thought there wasn't
a bottle in the photo.

335
00:32:06,363 --> 00:32:09,838
That's because it was down here.

336
00:32:10,434 --> 00:32:12,870
What time is it, babe?

337
00:32:14,705 --> 00:32:16,573
Finn, you okay?

338
00:32:16,673 --> 00:32:22,079
Yeah, no. It's this part
of the painting... it's unfinished.

339
00:32:22,179 --> 00:32:26,550
I'm clearly about to paint it. I just have
no idea what element goes there.

340
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:29,038
Okay, Michelangelo, but...

341
00:32:29,138 --> 00:32:34,257
we have to close our eyes to match
the photo. So you're the timekeeper.

342
00:32:34,857 --> 00:32:37,895
Well... Yeah, dude, it's 7:59.
Just go ahead.

343
00:32:39,196 --> 00:32:43,800
Well, how long do we do it for?
10, 15 seconds?

344
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,571
I'll tell you when to stop. Just go.

345
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:52,643
I'll be thinking about my boyfriend.

346
00:32:52,743 --> 00:32:55,578
Sweet. Threesome.

347
00:32:56,013 --> 00:32:58,462
Come here, asshole.

348
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:26,677
Of course.

349
00:34:42,185 --> 00:34:45,122
Oh, geez, did you guys...

350
00:34:45,555 --> 00:34:47,450
Hey!

351
00:34:54,605 --> 00:34:56,478
Shit.

352
00:35:01,204 --> 00:35:02,873
- Finn.
- Go get Jasper.

353
00:35:02,973 --> 00:35:05,042
- I just wanted to...
- Go get Jasper!

354
00:35:14,084 --> 00:35:16,887
- Finn, I'm sorry.
- Who is this?

355
00:35:26,362 --> 00:35:29,165
That's my bookie. Ivan.

356
00:35:29,665 --> 00:35:32,135
The guy you're always talking
on the phone to?

357
00:35:32,535 --> 00:35:34,978
What is he doing in the apartment?

358
00:35:35,305 --> 00:35:37,449
- I don't know.
- Is that normal?

359
00:35:37,549 --> 00:35:40,277
Have you ever seen him
in our apartment before?

360
00:35:40,377 --> 00:35:43,380
No. It's not fucking normal.

361
00:35:44,581 --> 00:35:47,918
- Did you tell him about the camera?
- No.

362
00:35:48,018 --> 00:35:49,953
- Were you planning on it?
- No, never!

363
00:35:50,053 --> 00:35:51,598
Then what the fuck is he doing
in the apartment?

364
00:35:51,698 --> 00:35:53,931
I said I don't know!

365
00:35:54,031 --> 00:35:56,093
Okay, is he dangerous?

366
00:35:57,994 --> 00:36:03,100
Well, he takes bets from shady assholes
like me. So, yeah, he's dangerous.

367
00:36:05,101 --> 00:36:08,205
But... I don't see Marcus here.

368
00:36:08,305 --> 00:36:10,507
That's his goon.

369
00:36:10,607 --> 00:36:15,145
If I were in trouble,
he'd be in this photo.

370
00:36:16,046 --> 00:36:19,983
Well, what if he's sitting over here?
Out of view?

371
00:36:34,464 --> 00:36:37,735
I was up early this morning,
and I heard him moving around in his room.

372
00:36:38,869 --> 00:36:43,173
He came out about an hour ago.
Hasn't said a word.

373
00:36:43,273 --> 00:36:48,144
I don't know what those red pills are,
but he's taken at least two of them already.

374
00:36:48,544 --> 00:36:51,300
Can you guys shut up for a sec?

375
00:37:09,399 --> 00:37:10,834
<i>Yeah?</i>

376
00:37:10,934 --> 00:37:13,862
Hey, Ivan, it's Jasper.

377
00:37:13,962 --> 00:37:15,594
<i>I know.</i>

378
00:37:17,941 --> 00:37:19,890
How's it going?

379
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:21,748
<i>What?</i>

380
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,949
Is everything okay today?

381
00:37:26,049 --> 00:37:27,652
<i>Why wouldn't it be?</i>

382
00:37:29,986 --> 00:37:31,555
No reason.

383
00:37:32,355 --> 00:37:34,825
<i>So, what do you want to lay down today?</i>

384
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:39,062
No. No bets.

385
00:37:39,562 --> 00:37:43,032
I'm just going to cool it today. Thanks.

386
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,576
<i>So why did you call me?</i>

387
00:37:50,039 --> 00:37:54,110
Shit. I got to go, Ivan.
I'll talk to you later.

388
00:38:03,636 --> 00:38:05,594
So what does that mean?

389
00:38:05,922 --> 00:38:09,492
It means we wait 10 hours,
figure out what the hell's happening.

390
00:38:09,592 --> 00:38:10,995
Babe, can we talk?

391
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:41,024
Hey, Ivan. What a surprise.

392
00:38:41,124 --> 00:38:44,928
I was wondering why you showed up tonight,
and then it occurred to me.

393
00:38:45,028 --> 00:38:49,065
It's probably 'cause I called you
like a paranoid fucking idiot.

394
00:38:50,367 --> 00:38:54,004
Hey, Ivan. What a surprise.

395
00:38:54,937 --> 00:38:56,942
What are you doing?

396
00:38:58,341 --> 00:39:00,477
He's going to be here soon.
You can't leave me alone.

397
00:39:00,577 --> 00:39:04,715
Well, I'm not in the picture, so,
send me a text message when it's done?

398
00:39:05,415 --> 00:39:09,886
Well, I... I'm not
in the photo either, so...

399
00:39:09,986 --> 00:39:12,554
maybe I should leave too?

400
00:39:13,857 --> 00:39:16,292
- Where are you going?
- I don't know yet.

401
00:39:17,092 --> 00:39:19,130
Can I come?

402
00:39:22,899 --> 00:39:26,536
You guys are unbelievable.
Real friends you turned out to be.

403
00:39:26,936 --> 00:39:29,673
Well, we got to do
what's in the photo. Right, bro?

404
00:39:45,221 --> 00:39:47,231
Where we going?

405
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:52,470
Nowhere. I don't want to abandon Jasper
in case something goes wrong.

406
00:39:58,501 --> 00:39:59,763
Are we okay?

407
00:40:02,772 --> 00:40:05,275
I got jealous. This is a...

408
00:40:05,375 --> 00:40:08,516
It's a very complicated situation.
You're doing your best.

409
00:40:08,616 --> 00:40:11,380
And I, obviously, am...

410
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:13,540
I'm not handling it well.

411
00:40:22,425 --> 00:40:24,862
You got jealous?

412
00:40:26,396 --> 00:40:28,598
Tell me more.

413
00:40:35,538 --> 00:40:40,577
So, Ivan, I mean, what a surprise.

414
00:40:41,578 --> 00:40:43,992
You said that already.

415
00:40:44,092 --> 00:40:46,333
Oh, yeah.

416
00:40:47,216 --> 00:40:49,746
Can I get you something to drink?

417
00:40:52,055 --> 00:40:53,924
You know what I like about you, Jasper?

418
00:40:58,294 --> 00:40:59,930
You never welched on a bet.

419
00:41:02,165 --> 00:41:06,102
I have never had to send Marcus
over here to collect.

420
00:41:08,304 --> 00:41:10,707
And I can appreciate that.

421
00:41:11,107 --> 00:41:13,177
I can.

422
00:41:19,982 --> 00:41:22,252
Is that yours?

423
00:41:25,555 --> 00:41:27,924
You mind if I see it?

424
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,992
Come on. Let me see it.

425
00:41:42,405 --> 00:41:43,807
That's a nice one.

426
00:41:45,208 --> 00:41:48,312
Yeah. That takes me back.

427
00:41:50,813 --> 00:41:54,331
Believe it or not,
I used to have Marcus's job.

428
00:41:54,917 --> 00:41:59,188
I wasn't a bad enforcer.
I had my own style.

429
00:41:59,589 --> 00:42:02,492
You know, I used warm-up bats.

430
00:42:02,592 --> 00:42:05,361
They gave me a little extra "pop."

431
00:42:05,461 --> 00:42:07,472
Yeah.

432
00:42:08,298 --> 00:42:10,288
There was this one time...

433
00:42:10,388 --> 00:42:12,660
God Almighty...

434
00:42:14,671 --> 00:42:16,339
I was supposed to "kneecap" a guy.

435
00:42:16,739 --> 00:42:20,343
Standard boilerplate stuff.
I'd done it a hundred times, right?

436
00:42:20,443 --> 00:42:24,180
Only this time, I take a swing,
I hit him... Bam!

437
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,649
And the bat breaks.

438
00:42:26,749 --> 00:42:31,191
It sends a sliver of wood...
right into the guy's junk.

439
00:42:32,455 --> 00:42:34,958
You should have heard him.
He was screaming like a cat.

440
00:42:35,958 --> 00:42:38,561
I swear to God, as I heard
the paramedics take him away,

441
00:42:38,961 --> 00:42:42,765
they said that one of his testicles
had swollen to the size of a grapefruit.

442
00:42:42,865 --> 00:42:45,902
You imagine that? That pain?

443
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:50,786
Messy.

444
00:42:52,275 --> 00:42:55,250
Messy, unfortunate work.

445
00:43:01,217 --> 00:43:03,715
In my position,

446
00:43:04,854 --> 00:43:08,892
there's only one thing worse than a guy
who can't make good on bets.

447
00:43:10,927 --> 00:43:13,930
And that's a guy who never loses bets.

448
00:43:19,836 --> 00:43:22,572
I'm just finally getting lucky, I guess.

449
00:43:24,807 --> 00:43:26,810
Just lucky.

450
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:29,947
You guess.

451
00:43:33,783 --> 00:43:35,588
Listen! There's no fix, okay?

452
00:43:35,688 --> 00:43:38,762
- Is it an owner?
- No! I swear!

453
00:43:38,862 --> 00:43:40,657
Fuck, it was just a streak, okay?

454
00:43:45,041 --> 00:43:48,731
Look, okay, okay!
I have a source! I have a source.

455
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,669
It's reliable.

456
00:43:53,007 --> 00:43:55,305
I can't explain it.

457
00:43:55,405 --> 00:43:57,223
It could cause some serious problems.

458
00:43:58,208 --> 00:44:01,577
Was it a doctor? Tell me
what they're doing to bring in the fix!

459
00:44:01,677 --> 00:44:04,948
No, it... It's nothing like that.

460
00:44:05,748 --> 00:44:08,185
Look, you wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

461
00:44:10,286 --> 00:44:12,008
Bullshit.

462
00:44:12,422 --> 00:44:14,725
Can't you just ride my bets?

463
00:44:17,026 --> 00:44:20,564
- Yeah. Just make the same bets I do and...
- I know what "ride" means.

464
00:44:22,932 --> 00:44:24,735
You are such a piece of shit.

465
00:44:26,202 --> 00:44:29,239
I hope you enjoyed
the peep show, Jasper!

466
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:39,616
I'll... take that.

467
00:44:41,584 --> 00:44:43,787
- Finn, this is...
- I was just leaving.

468
00:44:46,489 --> 00:44:48,292
So... are we good?

469
00:44:56,966 --> 00:44:58,907
So...

470
00:44:59,969 --> 00:45:03,273
- He basically knows.
- He doesn't know jack shit.

471
00:45:04,674 --> 00:45:08,044
Well, he knows that you have
some kind of information.

472
00:45:08,144 --> 00:45:11,014
I mean, how long is he going to be
content just piggybacking your bets?

473
00:45:11,914 --> 00:45:15,251
I don't know. Forever?

474
00:45:15,551 --> 00:45:17,554
I got it under control.

475
00:45:21,557 --> 00:45:24,594
You look like hell, Jasper.
Are you even sleeping?

476
00:45:25,194 --> 00:45:28,610
You know what, man? Get off my dick!

477
00:45:28,931 --> 00:45:34,256
You and Callie both get all this money
for doing nothing. You should be happy.

478
00:45:34,456 --> 00:45:37,640
We're all in this.
Callie and I are sharing the risk.

479
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:42,211
I hope you have a back-up plan in case
this thing with your bookie falls through.

480
00:45:45,248 --> 00:45:48,951
I seem to remember you wearing something
a little different in tonight's photo.

481
00:45:49,051 --> 00:45:51,387
Screw you, Jasper.

482
00:45:53,656 --> 00:45:56,159
I'm not going to start
as long as he's here.

483
00:45:56,259 --> 00:45:59,529
Yeah, no, Jasper was just about
to take a walk. Aren't you?

484
00:45:59,629 --> 00:46:02,031
- I am?
- Yeah.

485
00:46:02,231 --> 00:46:06,302
Yes, don't forget to come spy
on me at 8:00.

486
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:19,982
So I don't really know
what I'm doing here.

487
00:46:20,082 --> 00:46:22,352
You're going to have to
walk me through it.

488
00:46:24,254 --> 00:46:26,222
Sure.

489
00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:29,058
We just need to get you
in the same pose in the photo.

490
00:46:29,158 --> 00:46:32,696
And then I... I do the rest.

491
00:46:35,932 --> 00:46:37,602
You know...

492
00:46:37,702 --> 00:46:40,901
I'd really like to know
how you got me to do this.

493
00:46:41,792 --> 00:46:44,040
You and I both.

494
00:47:17,792 --> 00:47:19,190
What are you thinking?

495
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:23,647
You're just... You're really...
You're very beautiful.

496
00:47:26,949 --> 00:47:28,818
Don't sound so surprised.

497
00:47:29,018 --> 00:47:30,822
No.

498
00:47:31,289 --> 00:47:36,953
No. I guess it takes a moment
like this to wake a guy up,

499
00:47:37,053 --> 00:47:40,329
so he can actually see
what's right in front of him.

500
00:47:54,076 --> 00:47:55,271
That's our cue.

501
00:48:12,962 --> 00:48:14,331
It's amazing.

502
00:48:15,731 --> 00:48:19,035
Even hazy and out of focus,

503
00:48:20,035 --> 00:48:23,573
you can still recognize
your own silhouette.

504
00:48:28,310 --> 00:48:31,347
I wondered all day... How?

505
00:48:32,247 --> 00:48:34,518
How is this possible?

506
00:48:37,954 --> 00:48:39,773
So...

507
00:48:40,273 --> 00:48:44,013
Marcus here is going to babysit.

508
00:48:48,197 --> 00:48:49,232
And you...

509
00:48:51,867 --> 00:48:54,004
You're going to take me
to see what's over there.

510
00:49:03,879 --> 00:49:07,450
I would not have believed you
if you'd told me.

511
00:49:10,052 --> 00:49:12,788
Kicks them out every night at 8:00.

512
00:49:12,888 --> 00:49:14,924
Yeah.

513
00:49:16,325 --> 00:49:17,994
What about the daytime ones?

514
00:49:19,228 --> 00:49:21,231
I don't know.

515
00:49:21,731 --> 00:49:24,401
Since we found it,
it's only been doing 'em at night.

516
00:49:25,501 --> 00:49:26,903
What's this?

517
00:49:28,637 --> 00:49:31,408
It's... It's the newest one.

518
00:49:32,842 --> 00:49:34,711
Okay.

519
00:49:35,211 --> 00:49:37,180
Okay.

520
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:40,197
Here's the deal.

521
00:49:42,351 --> 00:49:44,787
Every day you're going
to take this photo.

522
00:49:44,887 --> 00:49:47,657
And you're going to write down the stats
that go on the window tomorrow.

523
00:49:47,757 --> 00:49:49,725
Marcus is gonna come by
and pick up the photo for safekeeping.

524
00:49:49,825 --> 00:49:53,430
- Wait... Wait a second.
- I am not going to repeat myself!

525
00:49:54,497 --> 00:49:56,999
The three of you are going
to sit right there,

526
00:49:57,099 --> 00:49:59,803
just like that on the couch
so I know you're behaving.

527
00:50:00,636 --> 00:50:03,239
And you tell no one about this.

528
00:50:04,539 --> 00:50:07,904
We wouldn't want anyone messing
with our little golden goose here?

529
00:50:09,411 --> 00:50:11,595
Now, would we?

530
00:50:14,517 --> 00:50:17,086
I want 50%.

531
00:50:25,294 --> 00:50:27,161
You take a zero off that number.

532
00:50:30,099 --> 00:50:34,003
That still makes you a very lucky man.

533
00:50:34,970 --> 00:50:36,868
Yeah.

534
00:50:37,644 --> 00:50:39,943
I feel real lucky.

535
00:50:40,542 --> 00:50:43,065
We didn't agree to this.

536
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:47,795
- You should have talked to us, man.
- I did my best, okay?

537
00:50:48,618 --> 00:50:51,941
We're still going to get some money.
He's going to be making a lot of bets.

538
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:55,625
It'll be fine.

539
00:50:55,725 --> 00:50:58,227
What happens when the guy above him
gets wise to what's going on?

540
00:50:58,327 --> 00:51:00,530
How many more scary motherfuckers
are gonna show up here

541
00:51:00,830 --> 00:51:02,265
looking for a piece of this?

542
00:51:03,499 --> 00:51:06,802
Ivan's smart.
He's not going to fuck this up.

543
00:51:06,902 --> 00:51:09,371
Oh, that's very reassuring.

544
00:51:10,527 --> 00:51:12,745
It's unbelievable.

545
00:51:14,643 --> 00:51:16,012
Where's the photo from yesterday?

546
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:20,616
Wait, you're not seriously going to paint
at a time like this, are you?

547
00:51:20,716 --> 00:51:22,711
Yeah. I mean, what else
am I supposed to do?

548
00:51:22,811 --> 00:51:24,788
We obviously have no control
over what's happening.

549
00:51:26,956 --> 00:51:29,352
He's keeping the photos.

550
00:51:29,452 --> 00:51:31,727
For safekeeping.

551
00:51:32,761 --> 00:51:35,965
No! That is totally unacceptable.
Call him right now. Call him.

552
00:51:36,365 --> 00:51:38,868
Tell him we'll put up the results on
the window, but we're keeping the photo.

553
00:51:38,968 --> 00:51:41,036
Are you a fucking child?

554
00:51:41,536 --> 00:51:44,040
You're aware of who's on the other end
of this phone, right?

555
00:52:20,042 --> 00:52:23,412
I'm gonna make some tea, babe.
Do you want anything?

556
00:52:31,353 --> 00:52:34,990
You know, you were always
doing the paintings.

557
00:52:35,090 --> 00:52:38,027
You were just seeing
what you'd already done.

558
00:52:38,127 --> 00:52:41,964
I know. I'm aware of that, Callie.
That's what's so maddening.

559
00:52:42,064 --> 00:52:44,453
I painted them in the future.
Now I can't see the photograph,

560
00:52:44,553 --> 00:52:47,099
I end up not painting.

561
00:52:58,213 --> 00:53:00,916
- Jasper?
- What?

562
00:53:01,016 --> 00:53:05,187
Can't you just, like, sneak a photo
of the Polaroid when it pops up?

563
00:53:05,287 --> 00:53:07,590
Just grab one on the phone?

564
00:53:07,690 --> 00:53:09,725
Since you don't see the picture today,

565
00:53:09,825 --> 00:53:13,062
there won't be a painting
for me to photograph tomorrow.

566
00:53:13,362 --> 00:53:17,367
There will be, if you agree
to take the fuckin' photograph.

567
00:53:18,867 --> 00:53:23,172
Look, man, I mean... If your decisions
are gonna continue to dictate my future,

568
00:53:23,272 --> 00:53:26,661
can you at least make one
that benefits me?

569
00:53:27,309 --> 00:53:30,312
And risk my neck being broken
just 'cause you can't find your mojo?

570
00:53:31,112 --> 00:53:34,650
Fuck that. Can't you just
be happy with the money?

571
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:37,820
No. I can't, Jasper.
I don't give a shit about the money.

572
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,555
At this point,
I'd rather call the police,

573
00:53:39,655 --> 00:53:42,525
or fill a bucket of water and spill it
all over your precious machine.

574
00:53:43,692 --> 00:53:45,829
Is that a fuckin' threat?

575
00:53:47,863 --> 00:53:51,834
No, it's not.
But you can't ignore the fact that...

576
00:53:51,934 --> 00:53:54,170
some of us aren't making out
on this deal very well.

577
00:53:58,540 --> 00:53:59,843
I'll see what I can do.

578
00:55:28,864 --> 00:55:31,166
There's a painting. Thank the Lord.

579
00:55:31,266 --> 00:55:33,536
How about thank the Jasper?

580
00:55:36,471 --> 00:55:39,541
- What now?
- Oh, it's just it's kind of strange.

581
00:55:39,641 --> 00:55:42,077
Doesn't look like something
I would normally paint.

582
00:55:42,177 --> 00:55:46,982
It looks like you did it in a hurry.
See? That paint's still dripping.

583
00:55:47,582 --> 00:55:50,819
- Maybe it's a warning.
- About what?

584
00:55:53,789 --> 00:55:56,759
Maybe something bad's about to happen.

585
00:55:57,276 --> 00:55:59,595
You're sending us a warning. Look.

586
00:55:59,895 --> 00:56:04,066
We look scared, right?
And I'm staring up at that painting.

587
00:56:04,666 --> 00:56:06,802
I'm trying to tell myself something.

588
00:56:07,202 --> 00:56:12,041
I mean, we don't look happy,
but the situation isn't exactly ideal.

589
00:56:12,883 --> 00:56:17,679
No. You said it yourself, Finn.
That's not something you'd normally paint.

590
00:56:17,779 --> 00:56:20,182
Yeah, but art's weird, man. I'm just...

591
00:56:20,282 --> 00:56:23,285
I'm glad that there's something
on the canvas.

592
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:27,689
Just relax, Jasper.

593
00:56:36,565 --> 00:56:39,268
What if Jasper is right?

594
00:56:39,368 --> 00:56:42,504
What if something terrible
is gonna happen tomorrow?

595
00:56:42,604 --> 00:56:44,974
Then we wouldn't be in the photo, right?

596
00:56:45,074 --> 00:56:47,409
We'd have left.

597
00:56:47,509 --> 00:56:49,178
Okay. Why don't we?

598
00:56:50,479 --> 00:56:55,284
- What, leave?
- Yeah. We can pack our bags and just go.

599
00:56:56,585 --> 00:56:59,669
Well, and what? Just...

600
00:57:00,381 --> 00:57:04,125
leave Jasper to deal
with everything on his own?

601
00:57:04,572 --> 00:57:06,395
He wouldn't care. He'd be fine.

602
00:57:07,596 --> 00:57:09,464
That machine over there, I mean...

603
00:57:09,564 --> 00:57:13,669
We can't just walk away from it when
there's still hope for things to work out.

604
00:57:13,769 --> 00:57:16,733
I don't see why we'd do that.

605
00:57:20,175 --> 00:57:23,212
Okay. I trust you.

606
00:57:23,312 --> 00:57:28,253
Besides, you have to admit,
this machine, it's working magic on you.

607
00:57:28,683 --> 00:57:31,621
What can I say? I like being a muse.

608
00:59:21,997 --> 00:59:23,832
Bye.

609
00:59:33,508 --> 00:59:35,577
Hey, Joe.

610
00:59:36,970 --> 00:59:40,516
- You on duty tonight?
- Actually, yesterday was my last shift,

611
00:59:40,616 --> 00:59:43,605
so I'm just dropping off the keys.

612
00:59:44,819 --> 00:59:48,123
- Last shift?
- Yeah, man. Movin' up to the big time.

613
00:59:48,323 --> 00:59:49,646
Oh, shit.

614
00:59:49,746 --> 00:59:53,529
Congratulations. That's great. Awesome.

615
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:02,404
- Everything all right?
- Yeah. Yep.

616
01:00:02,504 --> 01:00:04,740
Oh, oh, hey.

617
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:07,810
Let me give you one of my cards.

618
01:00:13,314 --> 01:00:15,519
Let's have a drink sometime.

619
01:00:15,619 --> 01:00:17,453
Yeah.

620
01:00:18,253 --> 01:00:20,923
- Stay in touch, man.
- You too, Joe.

621
01:00:21,023 --> 01:00:22,918
Yeah.

622
01:00:45,567 --> 01:00:47,016
What's wrong?

623
01:00:47,903 --> 01:00:49,618
Marcus just caught me
talking to Big Joe.

624
01:00:49,718 --> 01:00:51,687
- What the fuck happened?
- Well, nothing happened.

625
01:00:51,787 --> 01:00:53,956
It's just... It's Big Joe's last night,
so he gives me his card.

626
01:00:54,056 --> 01:00:56,958
- What did Marcus do?
- He made a phone call. He drove off.

627
01:00:57,458 --> 01:01:00,729
Motherfucking shit fuck!

628
01:01:00,829 --> 01:01:03,815
Well, wait. Can't we just tell them
it wasn't anything?

629
01:01:03,915 --> 01:01:06,468
No, 'cause he's not gonna believe us.

630
01:01:07,068 --> 01:01:11,106
All right. It's okay. It's okay
because I fucking planned for this.

631
01:01:11,206 --> 01:01:14,009
- I hid weapons around the house.
- Wait, what?

632
01:01:14,209 --> 01:01:17,747
Only because you made
that fucking skull painting, okay?

633
01:01:19,914 --> 01:01:22,485
You have to make that painting
before the camera goes off.

634
01:01:23,919 --> 01:01:25,587
Make the fucking painting!

635
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:29,758
Okay. I'm sorry.
You hid weapons in our house?

636
01:01:29,858 --> 01:01:32,685
- Yes, I hid weapons in our fucking house.
- Why did you hide weapons?

637
01:01:32,885 --> 01:01:34,673
Do you know who the fuck
these people are?

638
01:01:34,773 --> 01:01:38,667
- What exactly did you hide?
- Just sit still and calm down.

639
01:01:38,767 --> 01:01:42,538
- No, I'm very worried about this.
- Just sit still and calm down!

640
01:01:46,341 --> 01:01:48,243
What happens after the picture
gets taken?

641
01:01:48,343 --> 01:01:51,413
- We wait.
- We just sit here and wait?

642
01:01:51,513 --> 01:01:55,651
They'll come in, ask us some questions.

643
01:01:56,251 --> 01:02:00,255
And if it goes well, that'll be that.

644
01:02:01,389 --> 01:02:03,959
What if it doesn't go well?

645
01:02:06,061 --> 01:02:08,127
Finn?

646
01:02:08,797 --> 01:02:11,500
There's a hammer under the couch.

647
01:02:50,805 --> 01:02:54,210
He was just the building's rent-a-cop.

648
01:02:57,012 --> 01:02:59,715
Then why is this
a police officer's card?

649
01:03:00,915 --> 01:03:02,882
Well, he just became one. All right?

650
01:03:02,982 --> 01:03:05,220
He was dropping off his keys.
It was his last shift.

651
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:09,840
I didn't tell him anything about you
or the machine, so...

652
01:03:11,793 --> 01:03:14,629
I would love to believe that.

653
01:03:36,751 --> 01:03:38,888
Unfortunately,

654
01:03:39,588 --> 01:03:40,604
I...

655
01:03:41,791 --> 01:03:45,050
can't afford to trust you.

656
01:03:47,456 --> 01:03:50,522
What... What's he looking for?

657
01:03:52,364 --> 01:03:54,389
Maybe I can help?

658
01:03:55,303 --> 01:03:56,772
She's your girlfriend, yes?

659
01:04:01,843 --> 01:04:03,744
Yes,

660
01:04:03,844 --> 01:04:05,494
maybe you can help.

661
01:04:14,222 --> 01:04:16,258
Okay.

662
01:04:17,125 --> 01:04:19,528
Now let's see if we can
remember anything new.

663
01:04:22,619 --> 01:04:24,250
I see you.

664
01:04:24,699 --> 01:04:27,644
Boyfriend. Adrenaline.

665
01:04:28,670 --> 01:04:30,939
Mind racing.

666
01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:33,576
Trust me. You're not fast enough.

667
01:04:34,709 --> 01:04:37,462
There is an easy way out of this,

668
01:04:37,562 --> 01:04:40,215
and that's just to answer
my fuckin' questions.

669
01:04:40,315 --> 01:04:42,818
- Please don't!
- You're gonna die.

670
01:04:44,819 --> 01:04:47,456
Why do I feel a total lack of concern?

671
01:04:48,256 --> 01:04:50,192
Because you haven't seen
tomorrow's photo yet.

672
01:04:53,094 --> 01:04:54,463
It shows your murder.

673
01:05:01,002 --> 01:05:03,672
And who kills me? You?

674
01:05:05,406 --> 01:05:06,342
He does.

675
01:05:11,012 --> 01:05:13,114
Maybe it's for the money.

676
01:05:13,914 --> 01:05:16,951
You must have a fortune
in winnings already.

677
01:05:49,551 --> 01:05:51,019
Keys.

678
01:06:10,371 --> 01:06:12,307
You should slide your chair
over this way.

679
01:06:16,244 --> 01:06:20,008
I'm serious. Once he sees that photo,

680
01:06:20,108 --> 01:06:22,484
he's gonna aim through that window
and shoot you in the back.

681
01:06:41,536 --> 01:06:43,706
Smart move.

682
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:06,329
Where's Jasper?

683
01:07:08,133 --> 01:07:10,332
Marcus, where's Jasp...

684
01:07:13,334 --> 01:07:15,604
Where is he?

685
01:07:22,544 --> 01:07:24,079
Jasper, fuckin' stop!

686
01:07:41,429 --> 01:07:45,133
Hello? Hi, Mrs. Anderson.

687
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:49,972
No, it was Callie. She...
She burned her hand on the stove.

688
01:07:50,772 --> 01:07:52,225
Yeah, everything's fine.

689
01:07:52,925 --> 01:07:56,078
Thank you. Bye now.

690
01:08:10,959 --> 01:08:12,828
Okay.

691
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:21,336
Oh, God.

692
01:08:26,274 --> 01:08:28,644
- Okay.
- Okay. Got it.

693
01:08:45,893 --> 01:08:48,129
We can't leave them in here
forever, you know.

694
01:08:48,229 --> 01:08:51,667
No shit. It's just for now.

695
01:08:54,335 --> 01:08:57,806
- All right. What's next?
- Next?

696
01:08:57,906 --> 01:09:00,909
Next I go get my money from Ivan's.

697
01:09:10,151 --> 01:09:13,021
Thank you for cleaning up
the living room.

698
01:09:13,621 --> 01:09:14,889
You mean the blood?

699
01:09:14,989 --> 01:09:18,593
Thank you for cleaning up the blood
that could have been mine?

700
01:09:18,693 --> 01:09:20,695
You're welcome.

701
01:09:21,529 --> 01:09:22,964
- Babe...
- Don't!

702
01:09:23,064 --> 01:09:26,602
- I'm just trying to make sure you're okay.
- Do I look okay?

703
01:09:29,237 --> 01:09:32,474
- What can I do?
- Why don't you go paint?

704
01:09:44,786 --> 01:09:46,654
Holy hell.

705
01:09:46,754 --> 01:09:48,790
I know, right?

706
01:09:49,090 --> 01:09:51,659
And this is just the start.

707
01:09:52,060 --> 01:09:53,695
Jasper.

708
01:09:54,195 --> 01:09:56,498
I think... I think we should leave.

709
01:09:57,599 --> 01:09:59,701
Split the money, get out of the country,

710
01:09:59,801 --> 01:10:01,770
get on the other side of it,
get away from the machine.

711
01:10:01,870 --> 01:10:04,405
Are you out of your fucking mind?

712
01:10:04,505 --> 01:10:07,108
The safest place on Earth is right here.

713
01:10:07,846 --> 01:10:10,311
As long as we see ourselves
in that photo every day,

714
01:10:10,411 --> 01:10:12,014
we know we're alive tomorrow.

715
01:10:13,548 --> 01:10:17,070
- Callie and I, we...
- We what?

716
01:10:18,152 --> 01:10:20,054
You know.

717
01:10:20,154 --> 01:10:22,857
All I know is that Jasper
saved my life tonight.

718
01:10:23,771 --> 01:10:24,893
I'm going to bed.

719
01:10:24,993 --> 01:10:28,072
Jasper, can you give me
something to sleep?

720
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:34,436
Thank you.

721
01:10:38,406 --> 01:10:40,375
Callie.

722
01:10:41,276 --> 01:10:43,811
Callie. Callie!

723
01:11:22,050 --> 01:11:26,521
Hello. I'm Dr. Heidecker.
Forgive the hour and my appearance.

724
01:11:26,621 --> 01:11:29,157
Well, how can I help you?

725
01:11:29,257 --> 01:11:32,560
Henry Bezzerides is a colleague of mine.

726
01:11:32,660 --> 01:11:35,464
Does he live in the apartment
across the way?

727
01:11:36,797 --> 01:11:39,920
Yeah. Yes, he does.

728
01:11:41,035 --> 01:11:44,005
I knocked. There was no answer.

729
01:11:44,105 --> 01:11:46,174
What's going on?

730
01:11:46,274 --> 01:11:48,876
A Dr. Hei... Heidecker is here.

731
01:11:48,976 --> 01:11:51,445
She's looking for Mr. Bezzerides.

732
01:11:51,545 --> 01:11:54,882
Did you tell her that he moved out
a couple months ago?

733
01:11:57,285 --> 01:12:02,790
Did he give you his hat before he left?

734
01:12:07,996 --> 01:12:10,328
So we... we found his journal,

735
01:12:10,428 --> 01:12:14,268
and from what we've read,
I guess he saw something bad.

736
01:12:14,368 --> 01:12:18,073
- I know. I know. He sent me a letter.
- He tried to change it.

737
01:12:18,673 --> 01:12:21,643
After Henry retired,
he kept me up on his experiments.

738
01:12:22,143 --> 01:12:25,647
To be honest, I didn't think
they'd amount to much.

739
01:12:27,181 --> 01:12:29,384
- Poor Henry.
- Yep.

740
01:12:30,473 --> 01:12:32,553
Don't fuck with time.

741
01:12:33,654 --> 01:12:37,258
Well... you think time did this?

742
01:12:37,358 --> 01:12:40,162
That he was somehow punished
for trying to change the future?

743
01:12:41,496 --> 01:12:43,998
Well, what else would do that
to someone?

744
01:12:44,598 --> 01:12:47,769
Thorium gas would be my first guess.
You see the coil over there?

745
01:12:47,869 --> 01:12:51,106
I'm guessing he was stretching for it
up on that shelf there

746
01:12:51,206 --> 01:12:54,576
when he knocked over the canister.

747
01:12:55,176 --> 01:12:59,013
It's just an accident, his death.
That's all. Nothing more.

748
01:12:59,814 --> 01:13:02,074
I suspect...

749
01:13:02,174 --> 01:13:04,752
he was panicked
whilst in the process of...

750
01:13:05,052 --> 01:13:08,791
trying to... avoid this.

751
01:13:11,626 --> 01:13:16,464
You see his hat on the couch and what
looks like his blood on the window?

752
01:13:16,564 --> 01:13:19,029
It seems that he met
an unpleasant end, but...

753
01:13:19,129 --> 01:13:22,871
clearly this photograph,
which takes place tomorrow...

754
01:13:24,072 --> 01:13:28,109
had nothing to do with him at all.
Oh, it's ironic.

755
01:13:28,509 --> 01:13:30,445
Tomorrow?

756
01:13:30,545 --> 01:13:33,560
How could he have taken the photo when the
camera only shoots one day ahead of time?

757
01:13:34,749 --> 01:13:39,170
Why, I don't know where you're getting
your data, but I believe you're mistaken.

758
01:13:39,270 --> 01:13:40,989
This letter's postmarked a week ago,

759
01:13:41,089 --> 01:13:44,225
so he had to have taken the photo
at least that far in advance.

760
01:13:44,325 --> 01:13:46,628
A week? How could he have...
how could he have mailed the photo?

761
01:13:47,028 --> 01:13:50,064
You're telling me you can shoot
a photo whenever you want?

762
01:13:50,164 --> 01:13:53,701
No. I don't know about
"whenever you want."

763
01:13:54,102 --> 01:13:56,804
Evidently, Henry had moved
past the initial tests

764
01:13:56,904 --> 01:13:58,840
and had got it to look further.

765
01:13:58,940 --> 01:14:02,010
Do you think you could
change the settings?

766
01:14:04,512 --> 01:14:06,480
No.

767
01:14:06,580 --> 01:14:10,118
Henry shared his results with me,
but not his methods.

768
01:14:11,385 --> 01:14:14,422
I don't know any more
about the controls than you do.

769
01:14:14,822 --> 01:14:16,758
That's too bad.

770
01:14:55,363 --> 01:14:57,331
That lady didn't mean us any harm.

771
01:14:58,131 --> 01:15:00,298
What about the gun in her hand?

772
01:15:00,398 --> 01:15:02,970
She wasn't going to use it.

773
01:15:03,070 --> 01:15:04,539
You don't fucking know that, okay?

774
01:15:04,939 --> 01:15:08,623
And if I didn't act, then Callie
would be waking up to our dead bodies!

775
01:15:08,723 --> 01:15:10,913
At the very least,
the police would have shown up.

776
01:15:16,083 --> 01:15:18,419
Sounds like Jasper
was just trying to protect us.

777
01:15:18,619 --> 01:15:20,589
Well, you were not there.

778
01:15:35,770 --> 01:15:38,306
Ready for your big moment?

779
01:15:38,806 --> 01:15:39,735
Hell, yes.

780
01:15:40,235 --> 01:15:42,537
Do you want me to go over there
and make sure you've got it right?

781
01:15:44,823 --> 01:15:46,704
Yeah.

782
01:16:40,835 --> 01:16:42,570
What's tomorrow's look like?

783
01:17:01,956 --> 01:17:04,169
Hey, Callie?

784
01:17:13,146 --> 01:17:15,690
Is that tomorrow's photo?

785
01:17:17,505 --> 01:17:18,907
Well, fine. I don't want to see it.

786
01:17:19,007 --> 01:17:21,909
Can we please... pack one
of your bags and let's leave?

787
01:17:22,209 --> 01:17:24,801
You're not going anywhere.

788
01:17:25,212 --> 01:17:27,502
Did you not hear Dr. Heidecker?

789
01:17:27,602 --> 01:17:30,418
She said it was an accident,
so that means things can change.

790
01:17:30,918 --> 01:17:33,654
And I think I'm going to take my chances
with that, so please, come on.

791
01:17:34,293 --> 01:17:36,357
Go ahead.

792
01:17:36,457 --> 01:17:38,526
Commit suicide.

793
01:17:38,626 --> 01:17:40,628
But don't kill your girlfriend
in the process.

794
01:17:42,430 --> 01:17:44,531
What...

795
01:17:44,631 --> 01:17:45,867
You're in the photo?

796
01:17:48,302 --> 01:17:51,906
- Okay, fine. Let me see it.
- No.

797
01:17:58,345 --> 01:18:01,279
Oh, rip the Band-Aid off already.

798
01:18:29,810 --> 01:18:33,014
How's she doing? What is she doing?

799
01:18:33,614 --> 01:18:35,845
She's passed out.

800
01:18:36,517 --> 01:18:38,853
She was distraught.

801
01:18:38,953 --> 01:18:43,324
I gave her something...
to take the edge off.

802
01:18:44,825 --> 01:18:47,261
Oh, man.

803
01:18:47,928 --> 01:18:50,965
It was so good when it was good.

804
01:18:53,233 --> 01:18:56,237
We had such a cool relationship.

805
01:18:57,538 --> 01:19:01,736
- Sorry, man.
- Oh, it's not your fault. It's my fault.

806
01:19:04,111 --> 01:19:06,881
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

807
01:19:08,015 --> 01:19:09,851
I got this a year ago.

808
01:19:12,219 --> 01:19:14,756
And I couldn't pull the trigger.

809
01:19:15,956 --> 01:19:20,161
- Why's that?
- You were right. I was scared.

810
01:19:21,061 --> 01:19:22,882
Coward.

811
01:19:23,331 --> 01:19:26,834
I mean, I'm not a painter.
I'm a glorified janitor.

812
01:19:26,934 --> 01:19:29,203
And she deserves more than that.

813
01:19:29,303 --> 01:19:32,173
I mean, I wanted to be more than that.

814
01:19:33,841 --> 01:19:36,510
- I get it.
- No.

815
01:19:37,011 --> 01:19:38,860
No.

816
01:19:39,113 --> 01:19:43,117
I've been blaming you
in my head for all of this.

817
01:19:43,417 --> 01:19:47,992
And who knows? Maybe it was me
that was making the decisions, secretly.

818
01:19:48,889 --> 01:19:51,474
You know, just...

819
01:19:52,293 --> 01:19:55,862
sabotaging everything out of fear.

820
01:19:58,799 --> 01:20:01,802
Maybe there's a way to fix this still.

821
01:20:01,902 --> 01:20:04,456
- I think it's too late.
- Yeah.

822
01:20:25,626 --> 01:20:26,815
You know,

823
01:20:27,619 --> 01:20:30,647
I'm actually starting
to like that smell.

824
01:20:30,847 --> 01:20:33,801
I mean, how fucked up is that?

825
01:20:42,776 --> 01:20:46,814
When I saw the suitcase,
I knew you'd left the program.

826
01:20:49,016 --> 01:20:53,421
And I don't give a fuck
what Dr. Heiden-schmeiden says.

827
01:20:58,626 --> 01:21:01,929
You don't fuck with time.

828
01:21:07,834 --> 01:21:11,205
I need you alive at least one more day.

829
01:21:11,905 --> 01:21:15,042
If I have to drug you
and put you on that sofa myself,

830
01:21:15,242 --> 01:21:16,945
so help me, I will.

831
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:20,615
Here.

832
01:21:23,817 --> 01:21:26,287
That should keep you warm.

833
01:21:26,987 --> 01:21:28,823
All right.

834
01:22:31,451 --> 01:22:33,655
Oh, God.

835
01:22:34,922 --> 01:22:36,957
Help!

836
01:22:37,324 --> 01:22:39,827
Help me! Somebody help me!

837
01:22:39,927 --> 01:22:41,918
Okay.

838
01:22:47,701 --> 01:22:49,470
The gun.

839
01:22:49,570 --> 01:22:52,206
Goddamn it, Jasper.

840
01:23:21,301 --> 01:23:23,437
I paint this today,

841
01:23:24,037 --> 01:23:26,779
but you saw it two weeks ago.

842
01:23:29,176 --> 01:23:31,413
Did I send you down here?

843
01:23:35,816 --> 01:23:38,385
Why would I do that?

844
01:23:52,466 --> 01:23:54,436
Thank you.

845
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:55,296
Who the fuck is this?

846
01:24:58,598 --> 01:25:00,200
You motherfucker!

847
01:25:00,500 --> 01:25:03,137
Don't you dare! I'll fucking
kill you and wear your skin!

848
01:25:04,304 --> 01:25:08,075
<i>Well, if you do that,
the bucket's gonna fall.</i>

849
01:25:12,245 --> 01:25:14,315
<i>Get Callie and give her the phone.</i>

850
01:25:35,769 --> 01:25:37,238
<i>Stop pushing me.</i>

851
01:25:41,008 --> 01:25:42,543
<i>Take it.</i>

852
01:25:43,143 --> 01:25:46,185
- Callie, can you see me?
- <i>Hello?</i>

853
01:25:46,646 --> 01:25:49,584
<i>Jasper knocked me out last night,
and he locked me in the storage unit.</i>

854
01:25:51,418 --> 01:25:54,055
- What?
- He's going to kill you.

855
01:25:55,555 --> 01:25:58,359
No, he would never...

856
01:25:59,493 --> 01:26:01,577
Give me the phone.

857
01:26:04,398 --> 01:26:05,966
If you don't put that bucket down,

858
01:26:06,066 --> 01:26:08,051
I'm gonna blow her brains
all over this fucking window!

859
01:26:09,102 --> 01:26:10,904
<i>You're gonna kill us anyway.</i>

860
01:26:11,004 --> 01:26:13,875
<i>You're gonna kill me
if I put the bucket down or not.</i>

861
01:26:15,375 --> 01:26:16,944
<i>There's only one way out of this.</i>

862
01:26:17,244 --> 01:26:20,667
We walk away. If we walk away,
you get to keep your machine.

863
01:26:27,721 --> 01:26:30,757
<i>Hurry up! This bucket is getting heavy!</i>

864
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:42,003
Give Callie the phone.

865
01:26:48,041 --> 01:26:49,323
<i>Callie...</i>

866
01:26:49,723 --> 01:26:53,463
I want you to look
in Jasper's hoodie pocket.

867
01:26:53,563 --> 01:26:57,885
<i>He has something of yours,
something I got a long time ago.</i>

868
01:27:07,694 --> 01:27:08,996
I'm sorry.

869
01:27:09,396 --> 01:27:11,799
<i>I'm sorry that I haven't
been there for you.</i>

870
01:27:11,899 --> 01:27:15,036
It's okay. You are now.

871
01:27:16,169 --> 01:27:17,399
Take the gun.

872
01:27:17,867 --> 01:27:20,407
<i>Take it away from Jasper.</i>

873
01:27:22,009 --> 01:27:24,066
Give me the gun.

874
01:27:25,545 --> 01:27:26,980
Give me the gun.

875
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:29,462
Give it to me.

876
01:27:32,452 --> 01:27:34,855
Now back up.

877
01:27:35,255 --> 01:27:37,324
<i>Over there.</i>

878
01:27:44,397 --> 01:27:46,900
Whatever you say.

879
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:50,070
- <i>I'll be there in 30 seconds.</i>
- Okay.

880
01:28:07,854 --> 01:28:09,907
Hang on.

881
01:28:12,893 --> 01:28:14,228
Goddamn it.

882
01:28:17,831 --> 01:28:19,918
Pack. Quickly.

883
01:28:21,902 --> 01:28:24,772
You know what? Maybe this'll
keep you warm at night.

884
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:30,981
- Where will you go?
- Far.

885
01:28:32,179 --> 01:28:33,881
We're going to need some of this.

886
01:28:34,887 --> 01:28:37,714
- Take as much as you want.
- Yeah, you could always make more, right?

887
01:28:37,914 --> 01:28:39,420
Don't forget your ring.

888
01:29:18,825 --> 01:29:22,037
Oh, my God. I really killed him.

889
01:29:22,508 --> 01:29:25,517
- You had no choice.
- Hey.

890
01:29:25,865 --> 01:29:28,468
Come sit down. Are you okay?

891
01:29:29,743 --> 01:29:33,807
- I'm going to get you some ice.
- Okay, but we need to go.

892
01:29:35,145 --> 01:29:37,200
Oh, my God.

893
01:29:41,014 --> 01:29:44,284
Look. The photo... it changed!

894
01:29:44,384 --> 01:29:46,970
Oh, thank God.

895
01:29:47,070 --> 01:29:49,723
When I saw that photo
of you two together...

896
01:29:49,823 --> 01:29:51,792
No, it's okay.

897
01:29:51,892 --> 01:29:55,863
I just didn't think I'd be able to change
anything if Dr. Heidecker's letter didn't...

898
01:29:57,297 --> 01:29:59,533
Oh, shit.

899
01:30:07,640 --> 01:30:09,899
I need to paint this.

900
01:30:10,677 --> 01:30:12,880
I... I don't understand.

901
01:30:13,680 --> 01:30:16,544
I paint this for Mr. "B", so I'd...

902
01:30:16,644 --> 01:30:19,389
be able to use his keys
to get out of the storage unit.

903
01:30:19,489 --> 01:30:21,788
It doesn't matter.
I'll tell you when we leave.

904
01:30:21,888 --> 01:30:25,459
- We need to go before the cops show up.
- Okay, I'm going to get you that ice.

905
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:10,170
This isn't... possible.

906
01:31:10,637 --> 01:31:13,840
I was always going to paint this?

907
01:31:13,940 --> 01:31:16,677
We haven't changed anything.

908
01:31:18,231 --> 01:31:20,947
Then where did this come from?

909
01:31:34,060 --> 01:31:36,596
- I thought you were getting ice.
- I was. I am.

910
01:31:39,567 --> 01:31:41,933
What were you saying?

911
01:31:45,563 --> 01:31:47,365
Doesn't matter.

912
01:31:47,974 --> 01:31:50,277
Here. You should probably go lay down,

913
01:31:50,377 --> 01:31:52,946
put this ice on your head.

914
01:32:35,688 --> 01:32:36,838
What the fuck was that?

915
01:32:38,525 --> 01:32:40,393
The camera just went off!

916
01:32:40,693 --> 01:32:42,864
What? Give... Give me this.

917
01:32:46,499 --> 01:32:48,818
I can explain.

918
01:32:51,571 --> 01:32:53,411
No.

919
01:32:59,011 --> 01:33:01,315
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

920
01:33:02,015 --> 01:33:03,500
Talk to me. Tell me what's going on.

921
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:07,101
- Look, let's just go sit down.
- No. Talk!

922
01:33:10,190 --> 01:33:12,025
Okay.

923
01:33:14,761 --> 01:33:17,964
Remember when we got the call
that Mr. "B" was behind on his rent,

924
01:33:18,064 --> 01:33:20,027
and I went to check on him?

925
01:33:20,127 --> 01:33:22,403
Hey, Mr. Bezzerides, are you home?

926
01:33:25,605 --> 01:33:29,643
I found the machine, and sticking
out of the camera was a photo.

927
01:33:35,048 --> 01:33:38,017
The reason there are nighttime
and daytime photos

928
01:33:38,117 --> 01:33:39,937
on the wall of Mr. B's apartment

929
01:33:40,387 --> 01:33:46,126
is because the camera takes a photo
at 8:00 pm and 8:00 am.

930
01:33:46,226 --> 01:33:48,228
By keeping you and Jasper
from knowing that,

931
01:33:48,328 --> 01:33:51,298
I could secretly pass messages
back to myself.

932
01:33:53,265 --> 01:33:55,558
You're up early.

933
01:33:58,638 --> 01:34:01,075
So when I caught you
in the kitchen just now,

934
01:34:02,976 --> 01:34:05,229
what... what were you doing?

935
01:34:10,049 --> 01:34:12,421
I was hiding this.

936
01:34:16,666 --> 01:34:19,132
Last night when Jasper posed
with all of the money,

937
01:34:19,232 --> 01:34:21,595
I switched out the photos.

938
01:34:26,666 --> 01:34:29,236
I switched them back just now.

939
01:34:32,871 --> 01:34:36,542
I've seen all of the nighttime photos,
and Jasper's dead, so...

940
01:34:36,924 --> 01:34:39,411
when was this taken?

941
01:34:40,447 --> 01:34:42,383
It's from before.

942
01:34:44,150 --> 01:34:45,486
Before when?

943
01:34:46,353 --> 01:34:48,270
Before before.

944
01:34:54,761 --> 01:34:57,297
A month ago, drunk charades?

945
01:34:57,497 --> 01:35:02,302
Look, it didn't mean anything.
I was just acting out.

946
01:35:02,402 --> 01:35:05,272
I'd get drunk sometimes, and...

947
01:35:08,875 --> 01:35:14,098
Look, it was almost as if I wanted
to get caught, so you would wake up.

948
01:35:15,782 --> 01:35:18,118
That's an excuse. Yeah.

949
01:35:18,508 --> 01:35:20,320
I'm sorry for being so weak.

950
01:35:20,720 --> 01:35:24,791
I just I can't...
I can't believe that you would...

951
01:35:26,659 --> 01:35:31,264
allow this... you had every opportunity
to prevent it, to warn us about it.

952
01:35:31,364 --> 01:35:34,200
Why didn't you do that?

953
01:35:34,300 --> 01:35:37,003
I was just doing
what the photos told me to.

954
01:35:37,103 --> 01:35:40,305
I was getting pulled along,
like we all were.

955
01:35:40,673 --> 01:35:44,011
And don't you see?
Everything happened for a reason.

956
01:35:44,111 --> 01:35:47,994
Look, everything we had before
was fading. You were so distant.

957
01:35:48,094 --> 01:35:52,686
But then you got jealous
for the first time in ages.

958
01:35:59,525 --> 01:36:03,196
And I finally got to feel
your kiss again.

959
01:36:06,899 --> 01:36:09,469
And you said it... it takes a moment
like this to wake a guy up...

960
01:36:09,569 --> 01:36:12,384
to what's right in front of him.

961
01:36:15,208 --> 01:36:18,511
Little by little,
we were coming back together.

962
01:36:19,619 --> 01:36:20,848
But then...

963
01:36:25,151 --> 01:36:30,134
You kept picking the machine
and your work over us.

964
01:36:30,234 --> 01:36:32,826
So I had to do something
to bring you back to your senses.

965
01:36:44,904 --> 01:36:46,631
And then today,

966
01:36:47,424 --> 01:36:52,112
you fought for us... harder than
I've ever seen you fight for anything.

967
01:36:55,355 --> 01:36:58,652
So in the end, everything worked out.

968
01:37:06,192 --> 01:37:07,628
Everything worked out?

969
01:37:20,773 --> 01:37:21,777
What are you doing?

970
01:37:21,877 --> 01:37:23,228
I'm going to do what we should
have done from the start.

971
01:37:23,328 --> 01:37:24,699
I'm going to destroy
that fucking machine.

972
01:37:24,799 --> 01:37:28,214
Stop! Please, stop.
You said we can change things, right?

973
01:37:28,714 --> 01:37:32,452
Then all I have to do is put a new note
in the window for tonight's picture.

974
01:37:32,852 --> 01:37:35,104
Then when I get the message last night,

975
01:37:35,204 --> 01:37:38,858
I'll know to prevent you
from catching me at the window just now.

976
01:37:38,958 --> 01:37:43,063
You'll never find the photos.
We'll never have had this conversation.

977
01:37:54,340 --> 01:37:57,544
If you destroy the machine,
I can't fix this.

978
01:38:09,822 --> 01:38:12,791
I wish you hadn't made me do that.

979
01:38:13,477 --> 01:38:15,862
It's going to be okay.

980
01:38:15,962 --> 01:38:18,998
We won't remember any of this tomorrow.

981
01:38:19,098 --> 01:38:21,401
It's going to be okay.

982
01:39:02,075 --> 01:39:03,943
What are you doing here, Joe?

983
01:39:04,043 --> 01:39:06,145
I got a message from Finn.

984
01:39:06,845 --> 01:39:09,015
He said that you two were leaving town.

985
01:39:09,615 --> 01:39:12,653
I might be interested to see
what Jasper was up to.

986
01:39:15,621 --> 01:39:18,109
What's on the window?

987
01:39:22,779 --> 01:39:23,944
Can I come in?

988
01:39:33,740 --> 01:39:36,342
Sure. Fine.

989
01:39:36,442 --> 01:39:38,845
It doesn't matter.

990
01:39:38,945 --> 01:39:41,565
Tonight none of this will matter.

991
01:39:47,320 --> 01:39:50,691
I guess you might have
some questions for me?

992
01:39:51,305 --> 01:40:51,252
