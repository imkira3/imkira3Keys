2
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:21,918
<i>This is one of my favorite
stories of all time,</i>

3
00:03:21,918 --> 00:03:24,610
<i>even though it begins in a basement.</i>

4
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:27,800
<i>I'm gonna tell it
the way it was written</i>

5
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,193
<i>by this guy-- Bellini--</i>

6
00:03:30,292 --> 00:03:33,383
<i>who lives underneath
the amazing, the remarkable...</i>

7
00:03:33,483 --> 00:03:36,873
<i>Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium.</i>

8
00:03:36,972 --> 00:03:38,667
<i>And,yes...</i>

9
00:03:38,767 --> 00:03:40,761
<i>he sleeps with a dolly.</i>

10
00:03:51,927 --> 00:03:55,217
<i>Bellini's job
is to build all the books</i>

11
00:03:55,317 --> 00:03:57,211
<i>for all the kids
who come to the Emporium.</i>

12
00:03:57,311 --> 00:04:02,794
<i>But it is also to chronicle the
life of Mr. Magorium himself.</i>

13
00:04:02,894 --> 00:04:06,284
<i>Mr. Magorium once made toys
for Napoleon,</i>

14
00:04:06,384 --> 00:04:08,976
<i>beat Abraham Lincoln
at hopscotch</i>

15
00:04:09,075 --> 00:04:13,761
<i>and holds the current record
for time spent upside down.</i>

16
00:04:13,861 --> 00:04:16,553
<i>There were those
who called Magorium a genius.</i>

17
00:04:16,653 --> 00:04:18,547
<i>My mom called him an eccentric.</i>

18
00:04:18,746 --> 00:04:20,242
<i>And this one guy from Detroit</i>

19
00:04:20,341 --> 00:04:23,432
<i>inexplicably called him ''Steve. ''</i>

20
00:04:23,631 --> 00:04:25,426
<i>But Magorium's story</i>

21
00:04:25,526 --> 00:04:27,619
<i>was reaching its final chapters.</i>

22
00:04:27,719 --> 00:04:31,209
<i>That's okay--all stories,
even the ones we love,</i>

23
00:04:31,308 --> 00:04:33,502
<i>must eventually come to an end...</i>

24
00:04:35,197 --> 00:04:36,991
<i>...and when they do,</i>

25
00:04:37,091 --> 00:04:40,281
<i>it's only an opportunity
for another story to begin.</i>

26
00:04:40,381 --> 00:04:44,269
<i>So the beginning of the end
begins with a chapter called,</i>

27
00:04:44,369 --> 00:04:46,562
<i>''Molly Mahoney's First. ''</i>

28
00:04:48,457 --> 00:04:51,447
<i>Molly Mahoney was the manager
of the Emporium,</i>

29
00:04:51,647 --> 00:04:55,635
<i>Mr. Magorium's apprentice,
and my only friend.</i>

30
00:04:55,735 --> 00:04:59,124
<i>In the mornings,
Mahoney would play her piano,</i>

31
00:04:59,224 --> 00:05:01,617
<i>attempting to finish
her very first concerto,</i>

32
00:05:01,716 --> 00:05:05,405
<i>but she never could find
the right notes.</i>

33
00:05:15,575 --> 00:05:16,771
<i>When she was younger,</i>

34
00:05:16,871 --> 00:05:19,164
<i>everyone thought
she was a musical genius,</i>

35
00:05:19,264 --> 00:05:21,357
<i>a brilliant pianist,</i>

36
00:05:21,457 --> 00:05:23,351
<i>and she believed them.</i>

37
00:05:23,451 --> 00:05:26,741
<i>But now,
as she became a grown-up,</i>

38
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,835
<i>she wasn't so sure.</i>

39
00:05:34,617 --> 00:05:36,811
<i>I don't know why grown-ups
don't believe what they did</i>

40
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:38,306
<i>when they were kids.</i>

41
00:05:38,406 --> 00:05:41,596
<i>I mean, aren't they supposed
to be smarter?</i>

42
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,472
<i>What Mahoney needed was the
opportunity to prove to herself</i>

43
00:05:49,572 --> 00:05:53,261
<i>that she was something more
than she believed.</i>

44
00:05:57,947 --> 00:06:01,536
<i>And that opportunity
was about to appear.</i>

45
00:06:01,636 --> 00:06:05,125
<i>And so that's how
this chapter begins...</i>

46
00:06:05,324 --> 00:06:08,216
<i>with my hat getting stuck.</i>

47
00:06:12,104 --> 00:06:13,599
Eric.

48
00:06:13,699 --> 00:06:15,593
Hi, Mahoney.

49
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,186
You're back.

50
00:06:18,285 --> 00:06:19,382
Yeah.

51
00:06:19,482 --> 00:06:21,476
I thought camp was four weeks.

52
00:06:21,575 --> 00:06:24,068
No, no...just the one.

53
00:06:24,168 --> 00:06:24,965
Uh-huh.

54
00:06:25,065 --> 00:06:26,261
My hat's stuck.

55
00:06:26,361 --> 00:06:27,458
Huh.

56
00:06:27,557 --> 00:06:29,053
Looks like you're
gonna need a ladder.

57
00:06:29,153 --> 00:06:30,150
Nah.

58
00:06:30,249 --> 00:06:32,742
I just need to jump higher.

59
00:06:32,941 --> 00:06:35,733
Eric, that's seven feet, at least.

60
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:38,724
Seven feet?

61
00:06:38,823 --> 00:06:40,319
- Really?
- At least.

62
00:06:42,512 --> 00:06:43,908
You think I should get
a running start?

63
00:06:44,008 --> 00:06:46,700
Yeah.

64
00:06:46,799 --> 00:06:48,494
So, did you make any friends
at camp?

65
00:06:48,594 --> 00:06:49,591
Yeah.

66
00:06:49,691 --> 00:06:50,787
Uh...Jeff.

67
00:06:50,887 --> 00:06:52,482
Is Jeff real?

68
00:06:52,582 --> 00:06:54,277
Yeah. Sure.

69
00:06:54,376 --> 00:06:56,570
Is he an animal?

70
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:59,960
He was a squirrel.

71
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,150
Good morning.

72
00:07:41,634 --> 00:07:44,126
ERIC Gotcha.

73
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:52,700
Uh-oh.

74
00:07:54,395 --> 00:07:56,788
That's a good way to lose a train.

75
00:08:11,244 --> 00:08:13,139
# I love to sing. #

76
00:08:13,238 --> 00:08:15,133
Mahoney.

77
00:08:15,232 --> 00:08:16,229
Morning, sir.

78
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:17,426
Already?

79
00:08:17,525 --> 00:08:19,519
Drat. Come in, come in.

80
00:08:19,619 --> 00:08:21,812
How did you sleep?

81
00:08:21,912 --> 00:08:23,906
Upside down.
Made my feet tingly.

82
00:08:24,006 --> 00:08:25,103
Mortimer, get off the couch.

83
00:08:26,997 --> 00:08:28,293
Do you like turnips?

84
00:08:28,393 --> 00:08:30,486
Nobody likes turnips.

85
00:08:30,586 --> 00:08:31,982
So you probably wouldn't
like turnip pudding.

86
00:08:32,081 --> 00:08:33,178
Probably not.

87
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:34,674
It's a shame because I made some.

88
00:08:34,773 --> 00:08:37,266
Sir, I was hoping to talk again

89
00:08:37,366 --> 00:08:38,562
about what we spoke about last week.

90
00:08:38,662 --> 00:08:40,755
About how paper
really shouldn't beat rock?

91
00:08:40,855 --> 00:08:42,151
No, sir.

92
00:08:42,251 --> 00:08:44,045
About me possibly finding a new job.

93
00:08:44,245 --> 00:08:45,242
That's what I was saying.

94
00:08:45,341 --> 00:08:46,438
What?

95
00:08:46,538 --> 00:08:48,033
I stayed up all night
making turnip pudding,

96
00:08:48,233 --> 00:08:49,728
and thinking, and
it occurred to me

97
00:08:49,828 --> 00:08:53,218
that I've owned the Emporium
for over 1 1 3 years.

98
00:08:55,311 --> 00:08:57,006
That's a very long time, Mahoney.

99
00:08:57,106 --> 00:08:58,402
Yes, it is.

100
00:08:58,502 --> 00:08:59,798
It's almost 1 1 4 years.

101
00:08:59,897 --> 00:09:01,792
And not once
have I even

102
00:09:01,891 --> 00:09:04,484
looked at a receipt,
so I have absolutely no idea

103
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:06,677
what the store is worth.

104
00:09:06,777 --> 00:09:07,873
Well, that's probably not very good.

105
00:09:07,973 --> 00:09:09,070
Exactly.

106
00:09:09,169 --> 00:09:11,163
Mortimer... fetch.

107
00:09:15,351 --> 00:09:16,946
Stupid zebra.

108
00:09:17,046 --> 00:09:18,840
I'm hiring an accountant.

109
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,037
- A what?
- An accountant.

110
00:09:20,136 --> 00:09:21,333
According to the word,

111
00:09:21,532 --> 00:09:23,426
it must be a cross between
a ''counter'' and a ''mutant.''

112
00:09:23,526 --> 00:09:25,620
And that may be precisely
what we need.

113
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,916
That's great, but...

114
00:09:27,016 --> 00:09:28,112
I'm pretty sure that word
is pronounced...

115
00:09:28,212 --> 00:09:30,007
I placed a call
into one of those agencies

116
00:09:30,106 --> 00:09:32,599
and they said they'd send over
one of their best mutants

117
00:09:32,698 --> 00:09:33,695
sometime today, hmm?

118
00:09:33,795 --> 00:09:35,291
So consider the matter settled.

119
00:09:36,387 --> 00:09:37,384
How is the matter settled?

120
00:09:37,484 --> 00:09:38,680
Quite perfectly in my opinion.

121
00:09:39,877 --> 00:09:40,973
- Come with me.
- Sir?

122
00:09:41,073 --> 00:09:42,270
- Hmm?
- I'm serious.

123
00:09:42,369 --> 00:09:43,366
What?

124
00:09:43,466 --> 00:09:44,563
I'm stuck.

125
00:09:44,662 --> 00:09:46,357
Ooh! To my floor?

126
00:09:46,457 --> 00:09:47,354
No, sir.

127
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:48,351
Then what?

128
00:09:48,451 --> 00:09:51,741
Like as a person.

129
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,934
You remember
when I was a little girl,

130
00:09:54,034 --> 00:09:55,729
and I could play Rachmaninoff's
2nd Piano Concerto

131
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:58,321
and everyone was talking
about my potential?

132
00:09:58,421 --> 00:09:59,916
Mm-hmm.

133
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,618
Well, I am 23 now,

134
00:10:01,718 --> 00:10:05,122
and everyone's still talking
about my potential,

135
00:10:05,222 --> 00:10:09,727
but if you ask me to play
the song I know best...

136
00:10:09,827 --> 00:10:12,530
I'll still play Rachmaninoff's 2nd.

137
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:15,433
May I suggest
you stun the world

138
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:17,935
with Molly Mahoney's First?

139
00:10:18,036 --> 00:10:19,437
I want to.

140
00:10:19,537 --> 00:10:21,639
But I am stuck.

141
00:10:23,842 --> 00:10:25,143
Come with me.

142
00:10:34,453 --> 00:10:36,656
This, my lovely, is for you.

143
00:10:36,756 --> 00:10:38,057
Thank you.

144
00:10:41,161 --> 00:10:42,562
What is it?

145
00:10:42,662 --> 00:10:44,064
It's the Congreve Cube.

146
00:10:44,164 --> 00:10:46,266
It looks like a big block of wood.

147
00:10:46,366 --> 00:10:48,268
It is a big block of wood.

148
00:10:48,368 --> 00:10:50,371
But now, it's your
big block of wood.

149
00:10:50,471 --> 00:10:52,273
Thank you.

150
00:10:52,373 --> 00:10:54,175
I was just saying
last night

151
00:10:54,275 --> 00:10:56,377
I don't have enough
big blocks of wood.

152
00:10:57,979 --> 00:11:01,783
Unlikely adventures
require unlikely tools.

153
00:11:01,883 --> 00:11:03,685
Are we going on an adventure?

154
00:11:03,785 --> 00:11:07,789
Well, my dear, we're already on one.

155
00:11:07,889 --> 00:11:10,392
All I will say is this:

156
00:11:10,492 --> 00:11:14,397
With faith... love...

157
00:11:14,497 --> 00:11:18,501
this block... and
a counting mutant,

158
00:11:18,601 --> 00:11:22,005
you may find yourself somewhere
you've never imagined.

159
00:11:25,108 --> 00:11:28,211
And with that...
let's open the store.

160
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:29,213
Wait, sir...?

161
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:30,414
Mortimer, I'm way ahead of you.

162
00:11:30,514 --> 00:11:31,615
Stay out of the refrigerator.

163
00:11:31,815 --> 00:11:32,616
Sir...

164
00:11:32,816 --> 00:11:33,617
Yes, my honeycomb?

165
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:34,719
You're wearing your pajamas.

166
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:37,822
Flapdoodle.

167
00:11:49,935 --> 00:11:51,136
Fore!

168
00:11:56,642 --> 00:11:58,644
Whoa!

169
00:11:59,746 --> 00:12:01,047
Whoo-whee!

170
00:12:10,157 --> 00:12:11,959
Whoosh!

171
00:12:14,462 --> 00:12:16,964
Eric, may I borrow your hat?

172
00:12:17,064 --> 00:12:18,065
Sure!

173
00:12:25,974 --> 00:12:28,277
Oh, excuse me. Hello.

174
00:12:28,377 --> 00:12:30,379
Uh, how much are you asking
for that fish mobile up there?

175
00:12:30,479 --> 00:12:31,580
- Oh, that one.
- Yeah.

176
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,681
Well, that's $50.

177
00:12:32,781 --> 00:12:34,283
- Fifty!
- Mm-hmm.

178
00:12:34,383 --> 00:12:36,686
50-- don't you think that's a
little high,just for a mobile?

179
00:12:36,786 --> 00:12:39,288
Well, if you'll notice,
they're fresh fish.

180
00:12:42,292 --> 00:12:43,493
Uh...

181
00:12:43,693 --> 00:12:45,295
If you don't want
to spend that much,

182
00:12:45,395 --> 00:12:48,899
we do have that fish mobile
over there for only $1 7.

183
00:12:48,999 --> 00:12:51,001
But those are not fresh.

184
00:12:51,101 --> 00:12:53,804
And they're high in cholesterol.

185
00:12:59,911 --> 00:13:01,613
Molly? Molly Mahoney?

186
00:13:01,713 --> 00:13:02,614
Yeah.

187
00:13:02,714 --> 00:13:04,916
It's Dave. Dave Wolf.

188
00:13:05,016 --> 00:13:06,918
I was in your physics
class in college.

189
00:13:07,018 --> 00:13:08,020
Oh, hey!

190
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,522
Hey! Holy... cow.
You still work here?

191
00:13:10,622 --> 00:13:11,523
Yeah!

192
00:13:11,623 --> 00:13:13,626
I mean, well... yeah.

193
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:16,729
So, uh, what about you?
What are you up to?

194
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:18,130
I'm an engineer.

195
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:19,732
Congratulations.

196
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:21,034
You know, it's funny.

197
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:22,435
I would never have
recognized you

198
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:24,237
if it wasn't for that finger thing.

199
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:26,840
Hah-- comes in handy
on the cash register.

200
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,742
Do you still play the piano?

201
00:13:28,842 --> 00:13:30,244
I do. Every day.

202
00:13:30,344 --> 00:13:32,947
Well, I'm here for a week.
Where are you playing?

203
00:13:33,047 --> 00:13:34,548
My apartment.

204
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:36,050
Oh, I-I thought...

205
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:38,753
Yeah-- do you want me to wrap
any of these for you?

206
00:13:38,853 --> 00:13:40,054
Oh, no. Thanks.

207
00:13:40,154 --> 00:13:42,757
Uh... you know, it was
really nice to see you.

208
00:13:42,857 --> 00:13:44,759
I always wondered
what happened to you.

209
00:13:44,859 --> 00:13:45,560
It's good to see you.

210
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,561
Yeah, you too.

211
00:13:46,761 --> 00:13:48,463
Wait, I'm... I'm sorry.

212
00:13:48,563 --> 00:13:50,866
Bouncy Balls--
always trying to escape.

213
00:13:50,966 --> 00:13:53,168
Okay, out.

214
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:55,771
Out.

215
00:13:55,871 --> 00:13:57,974
And you.

216
00:13:58,074 --> 00:13:59,375
You, too.

217
00:13:59,475 --> 00:14:00,977
Sorry about that.

218
00:14:01,077 --> 00:14:02,479
Take care.

219
00:14:02,579 --> 00:14:04,481
Okay.

220
00:14:07,284 --> 00:14:09,386
Ooh!

221
00:14:09,486 --> 00:14:10,587
Aha...

222
00:14:11,789 --> 00:14:12,990
Hiya.

223
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:15,292
Just, uh... uh, shopping.

224
00:14:15,392 --> 00:14:16,994
Shopping.

225
00:14:17,094 --> 00:14:19,597
Just, uh... shopping.

226
00:14:19,697 --> 00:14:20,898
No matter what they tell you,

227
00:14:20,999 --> 00:14:22,700
you don't have to stay in the lines.

228
00:14:22,801 --> 00:14:23,802
Pardon me, miss.

229
00:14:24,002 --> 00:14:25,003
Could you help me, please?

230
00:14:25,203 --> 00:14:26,805
I can certainly try.

231
00:14:26,905 --> 00:14:30,509
My grandson wants a fire engine
for his birthday,

232
00:14:30,609 --> 00:14:32,311
with a ladder
that goes up

233
00:14:32,411 --> 00:14:34,413
and a hose that squirts water.

234
00:14:34,513 --> 00:14:35,915
And I can't find one.

235
00:14:36,015 --> 00:14:38,217
This sounds like a job
for the Big Book.

236
00:14:41,521 --> 00:14:46,226
This has all the toys
we have in stock.

237
00:14:46,326 --> 00:14:51,632
Now, ''E'' for engine
or ''F'' for fire...?

238
00:14:51,832 --> 00:14:54,635
Let's try ''F.''

239
00:15:01,542 --> 00:15:02,744
Wow!

240
00:15:02,844 --> 00:15:04,746
How did you do that?

241
00:15:04,846 --> 00:15:06,147
I didn't do it.

242
00:15:06,248 --> 00:15:08,450
You must have done something.

243
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,851
Surprisingly, no.

244
00:15:09,952 --> 00:15:11,754
It's the Book.

245
00:15:11,854 --> 00:15:14,456
It's magic.

246
00:15:14,557 --> 00:15:16,258
Come on, guys.
Bring it up higher!

247
00:15:16,359 --> 00:15:17,259
Higher!
That's it!

248
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,362
Hey, get that bird
out of here, will ya?

249
00:15:19,462 --> 00:15:21,164
Hey. Whoa.
Okay, that's right.

250
00:15:21,264 --> 00:15:23,466
All right, bring it up,
bring it up, bring it up.

251
00:15:26,469 --> 00:15:28,171
Hello, excuse me, miss. Hi.

252
00:15:28,271 --> 00:15:29,973
Oh, hi.

253
00:15:30,073 --> 00:15:32,176
Um... hi.

254
00:15:32,276 --> 00:15:33,777
Um...

255
00:15:33,877 --> 00:15:35,579
Hello.

256
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,982
Um... I believe Mr. Magorium
sent for me.

257
00:15:38,082 --> 00:15:40,485
Oh. Wow.

258
00:15:40,585 --> 00:15:43,588
You're really well-dressed
for a shadow puppeteer.

259
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:48,193
No, no... I'm Henry Weston,
the accountant.

260
00:15:48,293 --> 00:15:49,294
Here for an interview.

261
00:15:49,394 --> 00:15:51,296
Ah... hello.

262
00:15:51,396 --> 00:15:52,698
My name is Mahoney.

263
00:15:52,798 --> 00:15:54,400
I am the store manager.

264
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,402
Pleasure to meet you.

265
00:15:56,502 --> 00:15:58,804
I have to admit,
when the agency sent me,

266
00:15:58,905 --> 00:16:01,407
I had no idea
that this was a toy store.

267
00:16:01,507 --> 00:16:03,209
Shh!

268
00:16:05,111 --> 00:16:07,013
If these kids found out
this was a toy store,

269
00:16:07,113 --> 00:16:08,615
we'd have a madhouse on our hands.

270
00:16:11,718 --> 00:16:14,421
That was a joke.

271
00:16:14,521 --> 00:16:16,824
I know.

272
00:16:16,924 --> 00:16:18,426
Okay.

273
00:16:18,526 --> 00:16:20,828
Uh... you probably want to speak

274
00:16:20,928 --> 00:16:22,830
to Mr. Magorium.

275
00:16:22,931 --> 00:16:24,733
Why don't you give me a second.

276
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:29,137
Hi.

277
00:16:33,042 --> 00:16:35,044
What is it?

278
00:16:39,148 --> 00:16:41,150
What?

279
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,963
It's not real nice
to stare at people, you know?

280
00:16:53,063 --> 00:16:54,265
Why don't you just

281
00:16:54,365 --> 00:16:55,966
go ahead and...

282
00:16:56,066 --> 00:16:57,568
This happens every time.

283
00:16:57,668 --> 00:16:59,270
Ah, greetings.
Edward Magorium--

284
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:00,972
toy impresario,
wonder aficionado,

285
00:17:01,072 --> 00:17:02,273
avid shoe-wearer.

286
00:17:02,373 --> 00:17:04,075
You're here for the
accounting position.

287
00:17:04,175 --> 00:17:05,276
Yes. Henry Weston.

288
00:17:05,377 --> 00:17:06,978
Mm-hmm. Name the
Fibonacci series

289
00:17:07,078 --> 00:17:08,980
from its 1 1 th to its 1 6th integer.

290
00:17:09,081 --> 00:17:10,082
Hello? Grandma?

291
00:17:10,182 --> 00:17:11,783
Uh... 89,

292
00:17:11,884 --> 00:17:14,386
1 44, 233,

293
00:17:14,486 --> 00:17:15,888
377, 61 0?

294
00:17:15,988 --> 00:17:17,089
Perfect.

295
00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:19,091
The number four--
do we really need it?

296
00:17:19,191 --> 00:17:21,094
If you like squares, you do.

297
00:17:21,194 --> 00:17:22,595
Oh, I like squares.

298
00:17:22,695 --> 00:17:23,897
Good. Now,

299
00:17:23,997 --> 00:17:26,299
the hot dog to
hot dog bun ratio--

300
00:17:26,399 --> 00:17:29,603
why, for the love of mustard,
are there never enough buns?

301
00:17:30,704 --> 00:17:32,406
Extra hot dogs.

302
00:17:32,506 --> 00:17:33,407
Yes, but why?

303
00:17:33,507 --> 00:17:35,609
In case you drop a couple.

304
00:17:35,709 --> 00:17:39,113
What kind of insufferable
fool drops a hot dog?

305
00:17:39,213 --> 00:17:40,815
Anything can happen, sir.

306
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,522
Anything can happen, hmm?

307
00:17:48,824 --> 00:17:50,926
How absolutely true.

308
00:17:52,227 --> 00:17:55,931
You're exactly the mutant
I'm looking for.

309
00:17:56,031 --> 00:17:57,333
You're hired.

310
00:17:57,433 --> 00:17:58,434
What?

311
00:17:58,534 --> 00:18:00,236
- You're hired!
- That's it, huh?

312
00:18:00,336 --> 00:18:01,938
- That's all I need.
- Uh, sir...

313
00:18:02,038 --> 00:18:03,840
- Don't you agree, Mahoney?
- No, not exactly.

314
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:06,343
Perfect. I've heard
great things about you.

315
00:18:06,443 --> 00:18:07,344
Really?

316
00:18:07,444 --> 00:18:09,646
No, not yet,
but I'm sure I will. Oh!

317
00:18:09,746 --> 00:18:11,648
I see you've brought
your abacus along. Top-notch.

318
00:18:11,849 --> 00:18:12,749
Come along.

319
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:15,452
I'll show you the store.

320
00:18:15,653 --> 00:18:16,954
# Bum, bum, bum #

321
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:19,657
#The store and then I'll
show you my office... #

322
00:18:19,757 --> 00:18:21,659
Duck, duck, duck...

323
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:23,161
goose!

324
00:18:28,767 --> 00:18:31,670
We sell almost every kind
of whatnot imaginable, Mutant,

325
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:33,372
from ant farms to zeppelins.

326
00:18:33,472 --> 00:18:35,574
I've owned this store
for 1 1 3 years,

327
00:18:35,674 --> 00:18:37,676
ever since I came
to this country,

328
00:18:37,777 --> 00:18:41,681
although I've been inventing
toys since the mid-1 77 0s.

329
00:18:41,781 --> 00:18:43,483
- Wha... Excuse me, sir?
- Yes?

330
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,885
Did you say 1 77 0s?

331
00:18:45,985 --> 00:18:48,088
Yes, sir. So, as you
can imagine, accounting

332
00:18:48,188 --> 00:18:49,589
is a brand-new concept to me.

333
00:18:49,689 --> 00:18:52,593
You know, that would make you
at least 2 40 years old, sir.

334
00:18:52,693 --> 00:18:55,195
You're already hired, Mutant.
There's no need to show off.

335
00:18:55,296 --> 00:18:57,698
Now, follow me.

336
00:19:09,411 --> 00:19:11,313
Here we are.

337
00:19:13,015 --> 00:19:15,417
I haven't thrown anything away.

338
00:19:15,517 --> 00:19:17,420
Yeah, yeah, I can see that.

339
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,822
Are-are all these receipts?

340
00:19:19,922 --> 00:19:22,325
Mostly. Some are
important documents.

341
00:19:22,425 --> 00:19:24,327
Others might be doodles
I never framed.

342
00:19:24,427 --> 00:19:25,829
I can't tell the difference.

343
00:19:25,929 --> 00:19:30,534
So you've obviously never kept
an account of your income.

344
00:19:30,634 --> 00:19:31,535
No.

345
00:19:31,635 --> 00:19:33,036
Or filed a tax return?

346
00:19:33,137 --> 00:19:34,037
No.

347
00:19:34,138 --> 00:19:35,339
Renewed your city business license?

348
00:19:35,439 --> 00:19:36,740
Renewed my...?

349
00:19:36,841 --> 00:19:38,342
Renewed your...
Eh, forget it.

350
00:19:38,442 --> 00:19:40,845
You realize to
determine the worth

351
00:19:40,945 --> 00:19:45,150
of this store out of this,
um... fire hazard, really,

352
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:48,854
is an insurmountable task,
and if you have...

353
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:51,757
somehow managed to keep
from going bankrupt

354
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:53,859
or being evicted,

355
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:55,761
sent to prison for
tax evasion, uh...

356
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:56,962
Oh-ho.

357
00:19:57,062 --> 00:19:58,764
...why do you want to do this now?

358
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,266
Ah, yes.
Can you keep a secret?

359
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:02,766
The firm holds a very strict
exclusivity policy.

360
00:20:02,866 --> 00:20:04,067
Don't worry.

361
00:20:04,167 --> 00:20:07,067
But can you keep a secret?

362
00:20:07,167 --> 00:20:08,467
Yes, sir.

363
00:20:08,567 --> 00:20:10,168
I'm leaving.

364
00:20:10,268 --> 00:20:11,568
The store?

365
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:13,868
The world.

366
00:20:15,269 --> 00:20:16,669
You see these shoes?

367
00:20:16,769 --> 00:20:19,169
I found these
in a tiny little shop

368
00:20:19,269 --> 00:20:21,170
in Tuscany

369
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:23,370
and fell in love with them
so entirely,

370
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:26,871
I bought enough
to last my whole life.

371
00:20:33,472 --> 00:20:35,272
These are my last pair.

372
00:20:42,773 --> 00:20:46,874
So, if you'll excuse me,
I have a pressing marbles match,

373
00:20:46,974 --> 00:20:48,374
and I must warm up

374
00:20:48,474 --> 00:20:49,875
my thumbs.

375
00:21:12,379 --> 00:21:14,979
Eric! Are you ready

376
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:16,979
for our marbles match?

377
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:18,880
- Mr. Magorium?
- Yes?

378
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,480
- Does that seem right to you?
- Does what...?

379
00:21:27,581 --> 00:21:30,382
No, this doesn't seem right at all.

380
00:21:30,482 --> 00:21:34,282
We must keep a watchful
eye on this, Eric, hmm?

381
00:22:24,891 --> 00:22:28,692
Don't worry, I'm...
fine up here, guys.

382
00:22:38,894 --> 00:22:40,894
<i>This chapter is called</i>

383
00:22:40,994 --> 00:22:43,395
<i>''No, Seriously, Watch. ''</i>

384
00:22:46,895 --> 00:22:48,696
No, seriously,

385
00:22:48,796 --> 00:22:50,596
watch.

386
00:22:54,797 --> 00:22:56,597
No way!

387
00:22:56,697 --> 00:22:57,597
Come on.

388
00:22:57,697 --> 00:22:58,697
Whoa!

389
00:22:58,797 --> 00:23:02,098
This is so cool.

390
00:23:05,899 --> 00:23:07,899
- Come on!
- Let's go!

391
00:23:36,804 --> 00:23:38,304
Wow!

392
00:23:58,908 --> 00:23:59,808
Uh-oh.

393
00:24:07,109 --> 00:24:08,910
It's so good.

394
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:11,910
Somebody!

395
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:14,311
Help! Help!

396
00:24:21,112 --> 00:24:23,012
Pretty impressive ball, isn't it?

397
00:24:23,112 --> 00:24:25,112
Impossible to dodge.

398
00:24:30,813 --> 00:24:32,914
This boy's weird.

399
00:24:54,818 --> 00:24:56,318
Mahoney,

400
00:24:56,418 --> 00:24:57,918
have you seen Mister...

401
00:24:58,018 --> 00:24:59,018
Good night!

402
00:24:59,118 --> 00:25:00,519
Have you seen Mr. Magorium?

403
00:25:00,619 --> 00:25:03,519
Yeah. He's, um,
he's about this tall.

404
00:25:03,619 --> 00:25:05,520
He's got crazy eyebrows...

405
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,720
He's upstairs.

406
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,121
Thank you.

407
00:25:11,221 --> 00:25:13,921
You really got to get better
with the jokes, Mutant.

408
00:25:14,021 --> 00:25:16,021
I'm laughing on the inside.

409
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:28,023
Mr. Magorium.
- Mutant.

410
00:25:28,123 --> 00:25:29,324
Mr. Magorium...

411
00:25:29,524 --> 00:25:31,924
Come to accept
my hula hoop challenge?

412
00:25:32,024 --> 00:25:33,524
We have a few serious problems.

413
00:25:33,624 --> 00:25:34,925
Ooh, serious problems.

414
00:25:35,025 --> 00:25:36,725
I don't have any serious problems.

415
00:25:36,825 --> 00:25:37,925
You do, actually.

416
00:25:38,025 --> 00:25:39,125
I don't think so.

417
00:25:39,225 --> 00:25:40,826
What about this, uh, invoice

418
00:25:40,926 --> 00:25:42,126
from this company in Brazil?

419
00:25:42,226 --> 00:25:43,226
They say that

420
00:25:43,326 --> 00:25:45,827
you owe them $300,000
for a magic

421
00:25:45,927 --> 00:25:47,627
doorknob?

422
00:25:47,727 --> 00:25:49,127
Oh, that's ridiculous.

423
00:25:49,227 --> 00:25:50,427
Thank you.

424
00:25:50,527 --> 00:25:53,728
$300,000 for a doorknob?

425
00:25:53,828 --> 00:25:56,028
I've never paid over $200,000.

426
00:25:56,128 --> 00:25:57,329
Here, catch.

427
00:25:59,329 --> 00:26:01,229
What about Bellini?

428
00:26:01,329 --> 00:26:02,329
Bellini's the
book builder

429
00:26:02,429 --> 00:26:03,430
born in the basement.

430
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:04,930
You have a tenant in the basement?

431
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,430
He was born there.

432
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:08,130
I certainly can't ask him to leave.

433
00:26:08,231 --> 00:26:09,231
Okay.

434
00:26:09,331 --> 00:26:11,131
According to your
employment records,

435
00:26:11,231 --> 00:26:13,631
you've had several fictional
characters on the books.

436
00:26:13,731 --> 00:26:16,132
- Like whom?
- The King of Planet Yaweh.

437
00:26:16,232 --> 00:26:17,132
Oh, he's not fictional.

438
00:26:17,232 --> 00:26:18,132
Sir, there are people...

439
00:26:18,232 --> 00:26:19,232
He's not really
the king,

440
00:26:19,332 --> 00:26:21,033
and the planet Yaweh
doesn't exist,

441
00:26:21,133 --> 00:26:22,833
but he's not fictional.

442
00:26:22,933 --> 00:26:24,433
Well, that's the thing.

443
00:26:24,533 --> 00:26:25,434
If there's no planet...

444
00:26:25,534 --> 00:26:26,634
- Mr. Weston,
- Yes, sir?

445
00:26:26,734 --> 00:26:30,034
you can't blame people
for having aspirations, hmm?

446
00:26:42,837 --> 00:26:45,037
Oh.

447
00:26:45,137 --> 00:26:46,537
Sorry.

448
00:26:46,637 --> 00:26:49,838
I just sort of took over.

449
00:26:49,938 --> 00:26:52,738
I thought it was
funny, but I guess...

450
00:26:52,838 --> 00:26:54,939
Sorry.

451
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,840
Hey, who did that?

452
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,240
I did that.

453
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:05,341
No, seriously, who helped?

454
00:27:05,441 --> 00:27:07,141
No one.

455
00:27:08,441 --> 00:27:10,841
Mahoney? Hello.
Got a quick question.

456
00:27:10,942 --> 00:27:12,242
Quick one. Quickie. Hey.

457
00:27:12,342 --> 00:27:13,442
Okay, Mutant.

458
00:27:13,542 --> 00:27:15,842
I need your help
explaining this history

459
00:27:15,942 --> 00:27:17,643
that Mr. Magorium has fabricated.

460
00:27:17,743 --> 00:27:19,343
What history he's fabricated?

461
00:27:19,443 --> 00:27:21,343
This one I've got
here-- for instance,

462
00:27:21,443 --> 00:27:23,944
got a signed I.O.U.
from Thomas Edison.

463
00:27:24,044 --> 00:27:25,144
Really?!

464
00:27:25,244 --> 00:27:26,844
''P.S. Thanks for the idea.''

465
00:27:26,944 --> 00:27:29,445
With a picture of the
lightbulb next to it.

466
00:27:29,545 --> 00:27:31,245
Is that for real?

467
00:27:31,345 --> 00:27:33,045
No. No, it's...
it's not for real.

468
00:27:33,145 --> 00:27:34,646
It's a signed I.O.U.
from Thomas Edison.

469
00:27:34,746 --> 00:27:35,846
Does that seem
like something

470
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:38,046
that would exist in
the real world to you?

471
00:27:38,146 --> 00:27:40,447
Well, it does have
his signature on it.

472
00:27:42,947 --> 00:27:44,547
Hello? Please?

473
00:27:44,747 --> 00:27:46,148
Give me one second, please?

474
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:47,248
Mahoney, wait.

475
00:27:47,348 --> 00:27:48,648
I just need...

476
00:27:48,748 --> 00:27:51,549
a simple explanation.

477
00:27:51,649 --> 00:27:54,249
Sure. It's a magical toy store.

478
00:27:54,349 --> 00:27:57,150
There's no such thing
as a magical toy store.

479
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:58,650
Of course there is.

480
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,850
When you say ''magical,''
do you mean ''special''?

481
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:02,651
- No, I mean ''magical.''
- ''Unique''?

482
00:28:02,751 --> 00:28:04,151
- ''Magical.''
- How about...

483
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:07,251
''Really, really cool''?

484
00:28:09,052 --> 00:28:10,352
Okay.

485
00:28:10,452 --> 00:28:13,653
What's behind me, all right...

486
00:28:13,853 --> 00:28:14,753
is a toy store.

487
00:28:14,953 --> 00:28:17,453
It is a big one,
it is a weird one,

488
00:28:17,653 --> 00:28:20,054
but it is just...

489
00:28:20,154 --> 00:28:22,054
a toy store.

490
00:28:22,154 --> 00:28:23,454
I knew it

491
00:28:23,554 --> 00:28:25,255
as soon as I saw that suit.

492
00:28:25,355 --> 00:28:26,355
Knew what?

493
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:28,055
You're a ''just'' guy.

494
00:28:28,155 --> 00:28:29,155
What's a ''just'' guy?

495
00:28:29,255 --> 00:28:30,455
A guy just like you.

496
00:28:30,555 --> 00:28:33,556
Same hair, same suit, same shoes.

497
00:28:33,656 --> 00:28:34,956
Walks around.

498
00:28:35,056 --> 00:28:37,657
No matter what,
he thinks, ''Oh,

499
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:39,057
''it's just a store.

500
00:28:39,157 --> 00:28:41,357
''This is just a bench.

501
00:28:41,457 --> 00:28:43,558
''It's just a tree.''

502
00:28:43,658 --> 00:28:46,258
It's just what it is, nothing more.

503
00:28:46,358 --> 00:28:48,559
Okay, but-but this...

504
00:28:48,659 --> 00:28:50,659
is just a store.

505
00:28:52,459 --> 00:28:55,260
I'm sure to you... it is.

506
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:30,680
I must say...

507
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:34,085
I am very disappointed in you.

508
00:30:38,091 --> 00:30:41,696
I understand feeling sad
or scared or even suspicious,

509
00:30:41,796 --> 00:30:45,401
but that is no reason
to turn gray and start pouting.

510
00:30:49,306 --> 00:30:52,110
I would expect
such behavior, perhaps,

511
00:30:52,211 --> 00:30:55,415
from a brand-new store,
or even a store a few years old,

512
00:30:55,515 --> 00:30:56,717
but a store

513
00:30:56,817 --> 00:30:58,619
your age...

514
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,823
sulking?

515
00:31:02,825 --> 00:31:04,628
It is simply

516
00:31:04,728 --> 00:31:07,232
atrocious.

517
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:13,140
The immitigable truth is,
I am leaving tomorrow,

518
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,543
and Mahoney,
bless her timid heart,

519
00:31:15,643 --> 00:31:18,648
will be given care of you.

520
00:31:18,748 --> 00:31:21,652
I'm sorry, my sweet,
but it's a perfect fact,

521
00:31:21,752 --> 00:31:24,856
and no amount of misbehavior
will change it.

522
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,663
She loves you,

523
00:31:29,763 --> 00:31:31,966
as do I,

524
00:31:32,066 --> 00:31:35,671
and we must face tomorrow,
whatever it may hold,

525
00:31:35,872 --> 00:31:39,276
with determination,joy and bravery.

526
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:44,183
So I suggest
you stop this petulance.

527
00:31:45,285 --> 00:31:47,087
Hmm?

528
00:31:47,187 --> 00:31:49,991
I expect you
to pull yourself together...

529
00:31:52,094 --> 00:31:56,400
...and put your best face on
by the time of my departure.

530
00:31:57,502 --> 00:31:59,405
<i>This chapter is called</i>

531
00:31:59,505 --> 00:32:03,510
<i>''Fun and Mental
Is Fundamental. ''</i>

532
00:32:03,611 --> 00:32:06,615
And there's also this
new guy, the Mutant,

533
00:32:06,715 --> 00:32:08,317
who's a little uptight.

534
00:32:08,517 --> 00:32:11,522
Sweetheart, did you spend
the whole day at the store?

535
00:32:11,622 --> 00:32:13,124
I did lots of stuff.

536
00:32:13,224 --> 00:32:14,426
Like what?

537
00:32:14,526 --> 00:32:16,328
I built a sculpture,

538
00:32:16,428 --> 00:32:18,932
I got 20,000 paddles
on a paddleball...

539
00:32:19,032 --> 00:32:21,836
and I figured out
how to win at solitaire

540
00:32:21,936 --> 00:32:23,238
every time without cheating.

541
00:32:23,338 --> 00:32:25,541
Eric, those are all things
you do by yourself.

542
00:32:25,641 --> 00:32:26,743
There were...

543
00:32:26,843 --> 00:32:28,746
people... around.

544
00:32:28,846 --> 00:32:31,550
We agreed you could come
back from camp early

545
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:33,853
if you made an effort
to make some friends.

546
00:32:33,953 --> 00:32:37,057
It's not my fault
people don't like me.

547
00:32:37,157 --> 00:32:39,961
People love you-- once they
get the chance to know you.

548
00:32:40,062 --> 00:32:41,664
No, they don't.

549
00:32:41,864 --> 00:32:43,667
They think I'm weird.

550
00:32:44,768 --> 00:32:48,073
Because you build sculptures
by yourself.

551
00:32:48,173 --> 00:32:50,376
Because nobody wants
to play with me.

552
00:32:50,476 --> 00:32:53,180
Have you asked anyone
to play with you?

553
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,183
Not really.

554
00:32:55,283 --> 00:32:57,987
Well, Eric, you have
to give people a chance.

555
00:32:58,087 --> 00:32:59,789
I know what'll happen.

556
00:32:59,889 --> 00:33:01,692
You don't, sweetheart.

557
00:33:01,792 --> 00:33:05,597
Trust me, people are
always full of surprises.

558
00:33:05,697 --> 00:33:08,802
Just...

559
00:33:08,902 --> 00:33:10,504
just pick someone.

560
00:33:10,604 --> 00:33:12,707
Anyone. Pick someone
you don't know,

561
00:33:12,807 --> 00:33:14,710
and try to make friends with them.

562
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:16,212
See what happens.

563
00:33:16,312 --> 00:33:18,315
I don't even know how to start.

564
00:33:18,415 --> 00:33:19,417
Easy.

565
00:33:19,517 --> 00:33:21,319
Start by saying hi.

566
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:55,868
# Don't be shy #

567
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:57,670
#Just let your feelings #

568
00:33:57,770 --> 00:34:00,574
# Roll on by #

569
00:34:00,674 --> 00:34:02,577
# Don't wear fear #

570
00:34:02,677 --> 00:34:04,980
# Or nobody will know #

571
00:34:05,081 --> 00:34:07,885
#You're there #

572
00:34:07,985 --> 00:34:10,388
#Just lift your head #

573
00:34:10,488 --> 00:34:12,391
#And let your feelings out #

574
00:34:12,491 --> 00:34:15,395
# Instead #

575
00:34:15,495 --> 00:34:17,198
# Now, don't be shy #

576
00:34:17,298 --> 00:34:20,302
#Just let your feelings
roll on by #

577
00:34:21,704 --> 00:34:24,408
# On by, by #

578
00:34:24,608 --> 00:34:27,312
#You know love #

579
00:34:27,412 --> 00:34:30,717
# Is better than a song #

580
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,623
# Love is where #

581
00:34:35,724 --> 00:34:38,327
#All of us belong #

582
00:34:39,729 --> 00:34:41,632
# So don't be shy #

583
00:34:41,732 --> 00:34:43,434
#Just let your feelings #

584
00:34:43,534 --> 00:34:46,739
# Roll on by #

585
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:48,842
# Don't wear fear #

586
00:34:48,942 --> 00:34:50,344
# Or nobody #

587
00:34:50,444 --> 00:34:53,448
#Will know you're there #

588
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:56,953
#You're there, you're there #

589
00:34:57,053 --> 00:35:00,759
#You're there,
you're there, there #

590
00:35:00,859 --> 00:35:03,362
#You're there, you're there #

591
00:35:03,462 --> 00:35:04,564
#You're there #

592
00:35:04,664 --> 00:35:06,967
#You're there... #

593
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:17,382
# No, don't be shy #

594
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:21,988
#Just let your feelings
roll on by #

595
00:35:22,088 --> 00:35:25,393
# On by, on by #

596
00:35:25,493 --> 00:35:28,197
# On by, on by, on by #

597
00:35:28,397 --> 00:35:32,002
# On by, on by #

598
00:35:32,103 --> 00:35:33,504
# On by #

599
00:35:33,605 --> 00:35:36,308
# On by... #

600
00:36:02,946 --> 00:36:04,548
Mahoney?

601
00:36:06,651 --> 00:36:08,153
Mahoney baloney?

602
00:36:08,353 --> 00:36:09,255
Sir...

603
00:36:09,355 --> 00:36:10,657
I have a riddle for you.

604
00:36:10,757 --> 00:36:11,758
Maybe not now, sir.

605
00:36:11,858 --> 00:36:12,860
Don't worry. It's easy.

606
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,463
What's short, amazing,
and says ''ouch''?

607
00:36:15,563 --> 00:36:16,865
I have no idea.

608
00:36:16,965 --> 00:36:17,867
Ouch!

609
00:36:19,068 --> 00:36:20,270
Very funny.

610
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:22,273
Sir, what's wrong with this corner?

611
00:36:25,778 --> 00:36:28,281
Apparently, despite my efforts,

612
00:36:28,381 --> 00:36:29,783
the store is not taking

613
00:36:29,883 --> 00:36:32,687
- my departure very well.
- What?!

614
00:36:32,787 --> 00:36:34,490
Wait, what departure?

615
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:37,094
It was intended to be
a spectacular surprise,

616
00:36:37,194 --> 00:36:39,697
but it appears the store
has other intents.

617
00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:42,701
That's one of my favorites,
Kristine!

618
00:36:42,802 --> 00:36:44,904
Wait, what was meant as a surprise?

619
00:36:47,007 --> 00:36:49,411
I'm giving you the store.

620
00:36:49,511 --> 00:36:51,514
You're giving me the store?!

621
00:36:51,614 --> 00:36:52,816
Surprise!

622
00:36:52,916 --> 00:36:54,718
- Surprise, surprise.
Excuse me?

623
00:36:54,818 --> 00:36:56,120
Yes, sir?

624
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,923
<i>Do you have Curious George
Goes to the Hospital?</i>

625
00:36:58,023 --> 00:37:00,626
Hmm. Mahoney?

626
00:37:01,728 --> 00:37:02,729
I'll-I'll ask.

627
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:03,831
An excellent piece

628
00:37:03,931 --> 00:37:05,934
of literature
and a fine choice indeed.

629
00:37:06,034 --> 00:37:07,436
Have you read it?

630
00:37:07,536 --> 00:37:08,638
Read it?

631
00:37:08,738 --> 00:37:11,842
I had brunch with the Man
in the Yellow Hat himself!.

632
00:37:11,942 --> 00:37:14,145
Okay, seriously, sir.

633
00:37:14,246 --> 00:37:15,447
What, Mahoney?

634
00:37:15,547 --> 00:37:17,250
I can't take the Emporium.

635
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:19,753
But you told me you needed
a new occupation.

636
00:37:19,853 --> 00:37:22,357
I meant writing music,
not running the Emporium.

637
00:37:22,457 --> 00:37:25,361
Why not? You'd do
a splendid job of it.

638
00:37:25,461 --> 00:37:26,463
Mr. Magorium...

639
00:37:26,563 --> 00:37:28,265
Yes? Oh.

640
00:37:28,365 --> 00:37:29,667
Oh, thank you, Bellini.

641
00:37:29,767 --> 00:37:32,171
It's for the gentleman
with the blazing red hair.

642
00:37:34,173 --> 00:37:35,976
- Mr. Magorium...
- Yes?

643
00:37:36,076 --> 00:37:37,178
why didn't you tell me any of this?

644
00:37:37,278 --> 00:37:38,480
Well, apparently,
you misunderstand

645
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:40,582
the rules of a surprise.

646
00:37:40,683 --> 00:37:42,385
But what if I don't want
the Emporium?

647
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:47,392
Why would you not want the Emporium?

648
00:37:47,492 --> 00:37:49,195
Because I can't run it.

649
00:37:49,295 --> 00:37:50,196
Why not?

650
00:37:50,296 --> 00:37:52,599
Because... you have to run it.

651
00:37:52,699 --> 00:37:53,801
That's not a good reason.

652
00:37:53,901 --> 00:37:56,805
It's called ''Mr. Magorium's
Wonder Emporium.''

653
00:37:56,905 --> 00:37:58,307
It rhymes!

654
00:37:58,407 --> 00:37:59,809
- Oh!
- Not to mention the fact

655
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:03,515
that... you're magic, and I'm not.

656
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:06,218
Besides, what are you
supposed to do

657
00:38:06,318 --> 00:38:08,221
if I'm running the Emporium?

658
00:38:10,224 --> 00:38:11,926
I'm leaving.

659
00:38:12,026 --> 00:38:13,128
You're leaving?

660
00:38:17,734 --> 00:38:19,237
Excuse me?
- Yes, sir?

661
00:38:19,437 --> 00:38:21,340
There's something wrong
with this book you gave me.

662
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:22,842
Wrong?

663
00:38:22,942 --> 00:38:26,647
Well, this is incomprehensible.

664
00:38:26,747 --> 00:38:28,550
Hmm.

665
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:31,354
The b... the book's just kidding around.

666
00:38:31,454 --> 00:38:33,456
I'll notify Bellini
immediately. Thank you.

667
00:38:33,557 --> 00:38:35,359
Mr. Magorium!
Mr. Magorium!

668
00:38:35,459 --> 00:38:36,861
- Y-Yes, Mark?
- Follow me.

669
00:38:36,961 --> 00:38:39,565
It's strangely weird
and weirdly strange.

670
00:38:39,665 --> 00:38:41,868
- What is it?
- We were finger painting,

671
00:38:41,968 --> 00:38:45,073
- Yes.
- as usual, and Katie looked up,

672
00:38:45,173 --> 00:38:46,475
and... see?

673
00:38:48,778 --> 00:38:51,482
- All the colors faded.
- We must check

674
00:38:51,682 --> 00:38:52,683
the Door of Rooms.

675
00:39:07,404 --> 00:39:09,207
Rats!

676
00:39:11,009 --> 00:39:13,513
Cheerleaders?!

677
00:39:14,714 --> 00:39:17,618
Confound it!
Mahoney, check the Big Book.

678
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:26,331
I would like...

679
00:39:26,431 --> 00:39:27,933
a lollipop.

680
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,943
Sir.

681
00:39:35,043 --> 00:39:37,646
Mahoney, the laws of gravity
have begun to apply.

682
00:39:37,747 --> 00:39:39,549
Sir, I asked the Big Book
for a lollipop.

683
00:39:39,649 --> 00:39:40,951
I got a lemur!

684
00:39:41,051 --> 00:39:43,154
A lemur?
We don't even carry lemurs!

685
00:39:43,254 --> 00:39:44,856
I'm not even sure
I know what a lemur is.

686
00:39:44,957 --> 00:39:46,058
Wait, is it
that primate thing

687
00:39:46,158 --> 00:39:47,260
looks kind of like a raccoon?

688
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,462
Sir, we don't have time...

689
00:39:48,562 --> 00:39:50,464
Mahoney, we don't have
time to discuss lemurs!

690
00:39:50,564 --> 00:39:52,067
You're right!
Where's Eric?

691
00:39:52,167 --> 00:39:53,268
Uh...

692
00:39:53,368 --> 00:39:55,171
I should do something, too!

693
00:40:00,679 --> 00:40:02,381
Eric?

694
00:40:02,481 --> 00:40:04,684
We need you.
There's a problem.

695
00:40:09,491 --> 00:40:12,689
Get off me! Aah!

696
00:40:12,789 --> 00:40:17,586
Somebody... give me a hand! Aah!

697
00:40:41,671 --> 00:40:43,370
Whoo!

698
00:40:44,869 --> 00:40:46,568
Help!

699
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,959
Time to go.

700
00:41:06,555 --> 00:41:10,752
The store is undergoing
a little difficulty right now.

701
00:41:10,852 --> 00:41:13,850
Please leave
through the front door,

702
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:15,849
calm and orderly.

703
00:41:15,949 --> 00:41:18,248
Ew! Ew! Ew!

704
00:41:18,348 --> 00:41:21,546
And maybe try to avoid
the slimy girl.

705
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:23,844
Three, two, one, liftoff!.

706
00:41:23,944 --> 00:41:25,043
Sir?

707
00:41:25,143 --> 00:41:26,442
Close the store.

708
00:41:26,542 --> 00:41:28,041
Let us all reconvene upstairs

709
00:41:28,141 --> 00:41:29,241
immediately.

710
00:41:29,341 --> 00:41:31,339
Lift... ah, crap.

711
00:41:33,838 --> 00:41:34,837
What's going on?

712
00:41:34,937 --> 00:41:36,036
I don't know,
but could you

713
00:41:36,236 --> 00:41:38,535
do us a favor and try
to catch the lemur?

714
00:41:38,635 --> 00:41:41,033
I don't know how to catch
a lemur. I'm a dentist.

715
00:41:41,133 --> 00:41:43,732
Well, I don't know how to catch
a lemur. I'm nine.

716
00:41:43,831 --> 00:41:45,830
Excuse me?

717
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:50,427
I am very disappointed
with this book

718
00:41:50,527 --> 00:41:52,826
I just opened.

719
00:41:56,024 --> 00:41:57,523
The store's shut down.

720
00:41:57,623 --> 00:41:58,722
You're here?

721
00:41:58,822 --> 00:42:00,621
- Apparently.
- But not actually?

722
00:42:00,721 --> 00:42:01,920
Please sit down, Mahoney.

723
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:04,618
We must commence
our conference contiguously.

724
00:42:04,718 --> 00:42:06,217
I must apologize.

725
00:42:06,317 --> 00:42:09,615
Mortimer and I had
an appetizer spread prepared,

726
00:42:09,715 --> 00:42:12,313
but... he ate the pancakes.

727
00:42:12,513 --> 00:42:14,112
- Who's Mortimer?
He's the zebra.

728
00:42:14,212 --> 00:42:16,111
- What?
- The... zebra.

729
00:42:16,211 --> 00:42:17,510
Forget it, Eric.
Order, order.

730
00:42:19,009 --> 00:42:21,008
Now, first order of business: Eric.

731
00:42:21,108 --> 00:42:22,007
Yes, sir?

732
00:42:22,107 --> 00:42:23,606
Ingenious hat.

733
00:42:23,706 --> 00:42:25,005
Thank you, sir.

734
00:42:25,105 --> 00:42:26,604
Second order of business.

735
00:42:26,704 --> 00:42:28,803
The store is stunningly upset,

736
00:42:28,903 --> 00:42:30,802
as indicated by its temper tantrum.

737
00:42:30,902 --> 00:42:32,301
Temper tantrum?

738
00:42:32,401 --> 00:42:35,299
You didn't see it?
How could you not see it?

739
00:42:35,399 --> 00:42:37,098
- He misses a lot, sir.
- Didn't miss

740
00:42:37,198 --> 00:42:38,297
the relapse notification from

741
00:42:38,397 --> 00:42:39,896
the County Zoning Commission--
got that one.

742
00:42:39,996 --> 00:42:41,495
Thankfully. Or else
you'd run the risk

743
00:42:41,695 --> 00:42:42,894
of having to submit
an SP-43 5

744
00:42:42,994 --> 00:42:44,893
and a letter of notary.

745
00:42:49,090 --> 00:42:51,189
He was in the office.

746
00:42:51,289 --> 00:42:53,987
Aha, I see.

747
00:42:54,087 --> 00:42:54,987
Well,

748
00:42:55,086 --> 00:42:56,685
it is my belief that the store

749
00:42:56,785 --> 00:42:58,085
has been growing
increasingly sad,

750
00:42:58,185 --> 00:43:00,783
and today threw a fit
in fear of my egress.

751
00:43:00,883 --> 00:43:03,281
You see, I've tried

752
00:43:03,381 --> 00:43:06,179
to imbue this store
with the same attitude,

753
00:43:06,279 --> 00:43:08,678
imagination and emotion

754
00:43:08,778 --> 00:43:11,376
as the children who
come to play in it,

755
00:43:11,476 --> 00:43:14,174
and as such, it is prone
to the same outbursts

756
00:43:14,274 --> 00:43:16,973
as its sometimes puerile clientele.

757
00:43:17,173 --> 00:43:18,971
Like a temper tantrum.

758
00:43:19,071 --> 00:43:20,470
Precisely, Mahoney.

759
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:22,869
- Maybe it needs a time-out.
- Hmm.

760
00:43:22,969 --> 00:43:25,367
I'm sorry. How can a store
throw a temper tantrum?

761
00:43:27,766 --> 00:43:30,164
Did no one explain
to the Mutant that it's

762
00:43:30,264 --> 00:43:32,863
- a magical toy store?
- I tried.

763
00:43:32,863 --> 00:43:34,062
It's a magical toy store, Mutant.

764
00:43:34,162 --> 00:43:35,561
It can do all sorts of things.

765
00:43:35,661 --> 00:43:37,460
But it didn't start turning gray

766
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:38,859
until Henry showed up.

767
00:43:38,959 --> 00:43:39,958
Me?

768
00:43:40,058 --> 00:43:41,857
I realize that, Eric.

769
00:43:41,957 --> 00:43:42,556
Wh-What?

770
00:43:42,656 --> 00:43:43,956
Oh, Mutant!

771
00:43:44,056 --> 00:43:45,954
I'm sorry, if I'm making
your magical playland

772
00:43:46,054 --> 00:43:47,953
go on the fritz,
I can just submit

773
00:43:48,153 --> 00:43:49,552
a form and get another agent.

774
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:51,651
Does your whole job
consist of submitting forms?

775
00:43:51,851 --> 00:43:53,350
No, Mahoney, sometimes
I receive them.

776
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:55,248
- Kind of half and half.
- Order. Order, order.

777
00:43:55,348 --> 00:43:56,348
Receive some, submit some.

778
00:43:56,448 --> 00:43:57,547
- But... this underscores
- Order, order.

779
00:43:57,647 --> 00:43:59,846
the fact that I'm in no way
responsible for anything

780
00:43:59,946 --> 00:44:01,345
that may have happened
in the Emporium today.

781
00:44:01,445 --> 00:44:02,944
I was just in the office working.

782
00:44:03,044 --> 00:44:04,043
There's that ''just'' word again.

783
00:44:04,143 --> 00:44:05,542
Give it a rest for
''just'' a second, please,

784
00:44:05,642 --> 00:44:06,941
on the ''just'' word--
just the adults'll talk.

785
00:44:07,041 --> 00:44:08,740
- Okay? So it's just...
- Eee...

786
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:09,839
nough!

787
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:12,438
Although
Mr. Weston's presence

788
00:44:12,538 --> 00:44:15,536
has coincided with the store's
dismay, it is not the cause.

789
00:44:15,636 --> 00:44:17,335
The only reason

790
00:44:17,434 --> 00:44:18,934
Mr. Weston is here

791
00:44:19,033 --> 00:44:21,232
is to determine
my legacy to Mahoney.

792
00:44:21,332 --> 00:44:23,631
- Your legacy?
- Mm-hmm.

793
00:44:23,730 --> 00:44:25,829
You mean, Mahoney gets
to run the store?

794
00:44:26,629 --> 00:44:27,428
How cool!

795
00:44:27,528 --> 00:44:29,627
What do you mean, your legacy?

796
00:44:29,727 --> 00:44:31,925
You're his heir; you're in his will.

797
00:44:32,025 --> 00:44:33,424
Why is there a will?

798
00:44:33,524 --> 00:44:35,323
Why do you know there's a will?

799
00:44:35,423 --> 00:44:36,522
I told you,

800
00:44:36,622 --> 00:44:38,021
my sweet.

801
00:44:38,121 --> 00:44:39,121
I'm leaving.

802
00:44:39,221 --> 00:44:40,620
But... I thought you meant,

803
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,618
like, retirement or... vacation.

804
00:44:43,718 --> 00:44:46,116
What kind of leaving
you talking about?

805
00:44:46,216 --> 00:44:48,515
Mahoney.

806
00:44:48,615 --> 00:44:52,312
I think he means
he's going to heaven.

807
00:44:52,412 --> 00:44:56,610
- Right?
- Heaven, Elysium, Shangri-la.

808
00:44:57,909 --> 00:44:59,408
I may return as a bumblebee.

809
00:45:00,507 --> 00:45:02,406
Are you dying?

810
00:45:02,506 --> 00:45:05,504
Lightbulbs die, my sweet;
I will depart.

811
00:45:05,604 --> 00:45:06,803
- Wait...
Mahoney.

812
00:45:06,903 --> 00:45:08,302
Wait.

813
00:45:08,402 --> 00:45:09,801
Are you sick?

814
00:45:09,901 --> 00:45:10,701
No.

815
00:45:10,801 --> 00:45:12,000
No?

816
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:14,099
Well, then when exactly
were you planning to depart?

817
00:45:14,199 --> 00:45:17,397
Around 4:30.

818
00:45:17,497 --> 00:45:19,295
This morning he was talking gibberish.

819
00:45:19,395 --> 00:45:21,194
Gibberish?!
- And then he grew feverish

820
00:45:21,294 --> 00:45:22,294
and he collapsed.

821
00:45:22,393 --> 00:45:23,593
I did no such thing!

822
00:45:23,693 --> 00:45:25,092
Uh, for at least five minutes.

823
00:45:25,192 --> 00:45:28,090
And then when he came to,
he was... he was like this.

824
00:45:28,290 --> 00:45:29,489
- Delusional?
- Delusional?!

825
00:45:29,589 --> 00:45:30,588
I'm not delusional!

826
00:45:30,688 --> 00:45:32,187
He hasn't been making any sense.

827
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:33,686
Oh, bunkum!
Hogwash!

828
00:45:33,786 --> 00:45:34,886
Pure horseradish!

829
00:45:34,986 --> 00:45:36,884
He claims he owns
a magical toy store.

830
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:38,183
I do. You work there.

831
00:45:38,283 --> 00:45:40,782
And that he's 2 42 years old
and an inventor.

832
00:45:40,882 --> 00:45:43,180
I am not 2 42 years old!

833
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,178
I'm 2 43. You were at
my birthday party.

834
00:45:46,278 --> 00:45:47,578
You brought me balloons.

835
00:45:47,678 --> 00:45:48,777
Yeah, he's delusional.

836
00:45:48,877 --> 00:45:50,676
He may have had a stroke.

837
00:45:50,776 --> 00:45:52,774
A stroke?!
You unbrookable ninny!

838
00:45:52,874 --> 00:45:55,972
The only stroke I have ever had
is one of genius!

839
00:45:56,072 --> 00:45:58,071
Okay. Nurse, can we
get him a sedative?

840
00:45:58,171 --> 00:46:00,070
Why are you lying like this?

841
00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:01,469
Because I have to.

842
00:46:01,569 --> 00:46:03,268
But your pants will catch fire.

843
00:46:03,368 --> 00:46:04,467
I don't care, sir.

844
00:46:04,667 --> 00:46:06,566
You have to live.

845
00:46:11,063 --> 00:46:13,461
Darling...

846
00:46:13,561 --> 00:46:15,560
I have.

847
00:46:26,553 --> 00:46:27,552
Hi.

848
00:46:27,652 --> 00:46:28,552
Hi.

849
00:46:28,652 --> 00:46:31,250
Uh, this is really hard.

850
00:46:31,350 --> 00:46:34,048
Yeah. It is.

851
00:46:34,248 --> 00:46:36,147
Because I got to tell you,
I'm really worried.

852
00:46:36,347 --> 00:46:37,346
Me, too.

853
00:46:37,546 --> 00:46:39,745
I can't track down
any insurance documents

854
00:46:39,845 --> 00:46:41,244
for the life of me.

855
00:46:43,142 --> 00:46:44,342
What?

856
00:46:44,442 --> 00:46:45,841
Hospital bills are astronomical
these days.

857
00:46:45,941 --> 00:46:47,640
- Mutant.
- Yeah?

858
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:49,139
He might be dying.

859
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:51,237
That means that we should be
even more prepared.

860
00:46:51,337 --> 00:46:54,235
Prepared? I found out
about this an hour ago.

861
00:46:54,335 --> 00:46:56,734
You know, I'm trying to be helpful.

862
00:46:56,834 --> 00:46:58,433
Well, you're being
positively dreadful!

863
00:46:58,533 --> 00:46:59,932
- Hey, it's just that...
-Just what?

864
00:47:00,032 --> 00:47:00,931
Well, nothing.

865
00:47:01,031 --> 00:47:02,630
Maybe you should ''just'' go home.

866
00:47:02,730 --> 00:47:05,628
- I can stay...
- Mutant.

867
00:47:05,728 --> 00:47:08,127
Go home.

868
00:47:08,227 --> 00:47:09,826
All right.

869
00:47:25,516 --> 00:47:30,613
Will any algae specialist
call extension 4324 stat?

870
00:47:33,511 --> 00:47:35,509
- You know...
- Hi.

871
00:47:35,609 --> 00:47:38,008
you shouldn't be
so hard on the Mutant.

872
00:47:38,108 --> 00:47:40,107
He wants to talk about insurance.

873
00:47:40,206 --> 00:47:41,406
I know, but...

874
00:47:41,506 --> 00:47:44,004
it's the only thing
he knows how to talk about.

875
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:51,799
What are we gonna do?

876
00:47:51,899 --> 00:47:53,298
I don't know.

877
00:47:53,398 --> 00:47:56,096
But there's kind of another problem.

878
00:47:56,196 --> 00:47:57,296
What?

879
00:47:57,396 --> 00:47:58,495
Mr. Magorium...

880
00:47:58,595 --> 00:47:59,594
Yeah?

881
00:47:59,694 --> 00:48:02,692
He... doesn't have any pajamas.

882
00:48:05,890 --> 00:48:08,189
The doctors can't find
anything wrong with you.

883
00:48:08,289 --> 00:48:10,287
Of course not.
I'm perfectly healthy.

884
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:11,886
Then why are you leaving?

885
00:48:11,986 --> 00:48:13,685
It's my time to go.

886
00:48:13,885 --> 00:48:15,184
That's it?

887
00:48:15,284 --> 00:48:16,583
What else could there be?

888
00:48:16,783 --> 00:48:18,482
What are we gonna do without you?

889
00:48:18,682 --> 00:48:20,781
Run the store.

890
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:22,880
Sir, I don't know how.

891
00:48:22,979 --> 00:48:24,778
That's why I gave you
the Congreve Cube.

892
00:48:24,878 --> 00:48:26,377
But it just sits there.

893
00:48:26,477 --> 00:48:27,676
What have you done with it?

894
00:48:27,776 --> 00:48:29,675
I don't know what to do with it.

895
00:48:29,775 --> 00:48:30,874
It's a block of wood.

896
00:48:30,974 --> 00:48:32,473
Can you think of nothing?

897
00:48:32,573 --> 00:48:35,871
Well, I'm sure I could think of
a million things to do with it.

898
00:48:36,071 --> 00:48:37,071
There are a million things

899
00:48:37,171 --> 00:48:38,969
one might do with
a block of wood,

900
00:48:39,069 --> 00:48:41,468
but, Mahoney, what do
you think might happen

901
00:48:41,568 --> 00:48:44,466
if someone just once...

902
00:48:45,865 --> 00:48:47,464
...believed in it?

903
00:48:50,662 --> 00:48:52,561
Sir, I don't understand.

904
00:48:55,559 --> 00:48:56,758
Eric!

905
00:48:56,858 --> 00:48:59,356
What task delivers
such a wee and hale

906
00:48:59,456 --> 00:49:01,355
stripling
to this chamber for the ill

907
00:49:01,455 --> 00:49:03,554
and barely insured?
Hello, Doctor.

908
00:49:03,654 --> 00:49:06,252
I brought you some stuff
I thought you might need

909
00:49:06,352 --> 00:49:07,451
from the gift shop.

910
00:49:07,551 --> 00:49:08,551
Super!

911
00:49:08,651 --> 00:49:09,750
Eric, would
you mind

912
00:49:09,850 --> 00:49:11,249
keeping Mr. Magorium
company while I go

913
00:49:11,349 --> 00:49:12,248
speak to the doctor?

914
00:49:12,348 --> 00:49:13,448
Sure.

915
00:49:13,548 --> 00:49:15,446
Mahoney, why do you need the doctor?

916
00:49:15,546 --> 00:49:16,346
Are you sick?

917
00:49:18,744 --> 00:49:20,643
What you got, Eric?

918
00:49:20,743 --> 00:49:21,742
Okay.

919
00:49:21,942 --> 00:49:23,441
- Okay.
- Here we go.

920
00:49:23,541 --> 00:49:24,541
Here we go.

921
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:27,139
PJs.

922
00:49:27,239 --> 00:49:27,739
Yes!

923
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:29,537
A toothbrush.

924
00:49:29,637 --> 00:49:32,236
Ah, morning becomes electric!

925
00:49:32,336 --> 00:49:34,734
And...

926
00:49:34,834 --> 00:49:36,133
A microscope.

927
00:49:36,233 --> 00:49:36,933
Oh...

928
00:49:37,033 --> 00:49:38,432
A water hose.

929
00:49:39,331 --> 00:49:40,930
And a nozzle.

930
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:42,030
Ooh!

931
00:49:43,129 --> 00:49:45,327
A plank of wood.

932
00:49:45,427 --> 00:49:48,226
Well, plank you.

933
00:49:48,326 --> 00:49:50,524
And... this.

934
00:49:51,624 --> 00:49:52,623
Whoa!

935
00:49:52,723 --> 00:49:54,622
Eric, what is that?

936
00:49:54,722 --> 00:49:55,721
It's a euphonium.

937
00:49:55,921 --> 00:49:59,818
Magnificent! Hand it here.

938
00:50:01,817 --> 00:50:04,515
If there's nothing wrong with
him, we have to discharge him.

939
00:50:04,615 --> 00:50:07,214
We can't be responsible
for men of perfect health,

940
00:50:07,314 --> 00:50:10,212
no matter how old or magic
they claim to be.

941
00:50:10,312 --> 00:50:12,910
So the fact is,
you have to take him home.

942
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:14,108
No.

943
00:50:14,208 --> 00:50:16,405
You have to understand,

944
00:50:16,505 --> 00:50:18,901
he's decided it's his time to go.

945
00:50:19,001 --> 00:50:20,698
Then the best thing you can do

946
00:50:20,798 --> 00:50:22,895
is make sure
he has plenty to live for.

947
00:50:24,692 --> 00:50:25,691
What in God's name...?

948
00:50:27,688 --> 00:50:28,886
What on earth are you doing?

949
00:50:28,986 --> 00:50:31,482
Practicing the euphonium.

950
00:50:31,681 --> 00:50:32,580
The-the what?

951
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:34,377
I thought I might give a concert

952
00:50:34,477 --> 00:50:36,574
in the psych ward tomorrow.

953
00:50:38,671 --> 00:50:40,568
There are people trying to sleep.

954
00:50:42,165 --> 00:50:44,662
Doesn't this hospital
need a signature

955
00:50:44,761 --> 00:50:46,659
to remove a patient's euphonium?

956
00:50:46,758 --> 00:50:48,256
Where the heck
did you even find this?

957
00:50:48,356 --> 00:50:49,654
I found it.

958
00:50:49,754 --> 00:50:51,252
In a supply closet.

959
00:50:51,351 --> 00:50:52,550
We don't keep
musical instruments

960
00:50:52,649 --> 00:50:53,748
in our supply closets.

961
00:50:53,848 --> 00:50:56,843
Well, where else
could I have found it?

962
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:00,537
What are you doing up there?

963
00:51:00,637 --> 00:51:03,034
Standing on a chair.

964
00:51:04,531 --> 00:51:06,129
Okay, that's it,
both of you,

965
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:07,327
out of here-- come on, let's go.

966
00:51:07,527 --> 00:51:08,825
You can come and see him tomorrow.

967
00:51:08,925 --> 00:51:11,121
Bye.

968
00:51:11,221 --> 00:51:13,318
Good-bye, Eric.

969
00:51:13,418 --> 00:51:16,014
Good-bye, Mahoney.

970
00:51:16,114 --> 00:51:18,909
Don't leave before tomorrow.

971
00:51:19,009 --> 00:51:21,006
Agreed.

972
00:51:24,002 --> 00:51:25,200
As for you,

973
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:27,696
young man, you need your rest.

974
00:51:27,796 --> 00:51:30,192
I agree.
This has been exhausting.

975
00:51:33,587 --> 00:51:35,384
What was that boy doing
on the chair?

976
00:51:35,584 --> 00:51:36,682
Making sure

977
00:51:36,882 --> 00:51:39,378
I have enough space to sleep in.

978
00:51:52,957 --> 00:51:55,553
All right, if you're supposed to help me,

979
00:51:55,653 --> 00:51:58,349
if you're supposed
to impart some great wisdom

980
00:51:58,449 --> 00:52:01,145
that's gonna help me
fix everything...

981
00:52:05,239 --> 00:52:07,335
...please...

982
00:52:09,632 --> 00:52:11,629
...do it now.

983
00:52:18,518 --> 00:52:21,913
All right, I'll do it myself.

984
00:52:39,586 --> 00:52:41,184
Hmm...

985
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:52,466
<i>This chapter is called</i>

986
00:52:52,566 --> 00:52:57,059
<i>''A Change of Heart...
of Mind... of Pants. ''</i>

987
00:53:05,646 --> 00:53:06,545
Morning.

988
00:53:06,645 --> 00:53:08,742
Hi. Morning.
How's he doing?

989
00:53:11,138 --> 00:53:14,033
Look, Mutant, I'm just grabbing
a few of Mr. Magorium's things,

990
00:53:14,133 --> 00:53:15,931
and then I'm leaving for the day.

991
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:18,527
Yeah, yeah.Just here
to work in the office.

992
00:53:18,626 --> 00:53:20,024
Unless...

993
00:53:20,124 --> 00:53:21,822
you want me to work out here.

994
00:53:21,921 --> 00:53:23,219
You can work
wherever you like, Mutant.

995
00:53:23,319 --> 00:53:24,218
No, no, I mean,

996
00:53:24,318 --> 00:53:26,015
in case there's, you know,

997
00:53:26,115 --> 00:53:28,411
a toy emergency, somebody
really needs something,

998
00:53:28,511 --> 00:53:29,809
you know, tiddlywinks.

999
00:53:29,909 --> 00:53:31,007
I could help 'em.

1000
00:53:31,107 --> 00:53:32,605
- You could help.
- Yeah, you know,

1001
00:53:32,705 --> 00:53:34,203
in case it's little
Timmy's birthday,

1002
00:53:34,203 --> 00:53:36,200
and somebody's a handful
of Legos short,

1003
00:53:36,299 --> 00:53:37,398
or whatever.

1004
00:53:37,498 --> 00:53:39,195
Do you want to run the store
for the day?

1005
00:53:39,295 --> 00:53:40,992
- Well, I'm here already...
- Mutant.

1006
00:53:41,092 --> 00:53:42,989
Okay, I-I'd like to run the store.

1007
00:53:43,089 --> 00:53:45,386
I've been waiting for two hours
on a very uncomfortable bench

1008
00:53:45,485 --> 00:53:47,382
to offer to run the store
for the day.

1009
00:53:47,482 --> 00:53:48,481
Why?

1010
00:53:48,581 --> 00:53:49,579
Because...

1011
00:53:49,679 --> 00:53:51,876
uh, because I'm a jerk.

1012
00:53:51,975 --> 00:53:55,670
I just, I felt awful because I
didn't want you to think that

1013
00:53:55,770 --> 00:53:58,865
I didn't care, and-and I do care.

1014
00:53:58,965 --> 00:54:01,960
It's just...
some people bring flowers

1015
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:05,655
or send a card or hug people.

1016
00:54:05,754 --> 00:54:07,252
You know, I make sure

1017
00:54:07,352 --> 00:54:09,249
that people's paperwork
is all filled out properly,

1018
00:54:09,349 --> 00:54:13,443
and... so... today, I thought
I'd try something different.

1019
00:54:13,542 --> 00:54:15,140
'Cause I like you.

1020
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:18,135
You know, I do want to help.

1021
00:54:20,831 --> 00:54:23,927
Mutant...

1022
00:54:24,026 --> 00:54:26,123
when you look at me,

1023
00:54:26,323 --> 00:54:28,420
what do you see?

1024
00:54:31,415 --> 00:54:33,412
Really pretty eyes.

1025
00:54:33,512 --> 00:54:37,206
No. I mean...

1026
00:54:37,306 --> 00:54:40,601
like, do you see a sparkle?

1027
00:54:42,997 --> 00:54:44,196
You mean, now?

1028
00:54:44,296 --> 00:54:47,091
Like, glitter on your face?

1029
00:54:47,191 --> 00:54:49,787
No, like, you know, a sparkle.

1030
00:54:49,887 --> 00:54:51,784
I... What kind of sparkle?

1031
00:54:53,481 --> 00:54:56,177
Like... something reflective

1032
00:54:56,277 --> 00:54:59,372
of something bigger
that's trying to get out.

1033
00:54:59,472 --> 00:55:01,369
You know what, never mind.

1034
00:55:01,469 --> 00:55:03,965
It might not
be so much

1035
00:55:04,065 --> 00:55:05,064
a sparkle.

1036
00:55:05,164 --> 00:55:06,661
Maybe, uh, more of a twinkle?

1037
00:55:06,761 --> 00:55:07,660
Forget it.

1038
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:08,758
Or a glint?

1039
00:55:08,858 --> 00:55:09,956
It's okay.

1040
00:55:10,056 --> 00:55:11,853
Uh, you've got the thing
that you do with your hands.

1041
00:55:11,953 --> 00:55:13,251
That's a quirk.

1042
00:55:13,351 --> 00:55:14,250
Quirk's not a sparkle?

1043
00:55:14,350 --> 00:55:15,548
Mm-mm.

1044
00:55:15,648 --> 00:55:17,245
Oh.

1045
00:55:17,345 --> 00:55:18,843
Yeah.

1046
00:55:31,723 --> 00:55:33,520
Good morning, Bluebell.

1047
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:36,216
- Good morning, sir.
- Look. Pants!

1048
00:55:36,316 --> 00:55:37,514
What about them?

1049
00:55:37,614 --> 00:55:40,709
Nothing.Just... pants.

1050
00:55:41,907 --> 00:55:43,305
Me, too.

1051
00:55:43,405 --> 00:55:45,602
Awesome! To the store?

1052
00:55:45,702 --> 00:55:47,898
Actually, you are coming with me.

1053
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:51,593
I'm a little nervous about this.

1054
00:55:51,693 --> 00:55:52,891
Why?

1055
00:55:52,991 --> 00:55:54,788
Because it's mischievous
and childish.

1056
00:55:54,888 --> 00:55:56,785
I can hardly wait.

1057
00:55:56,885 --> 00:55:58,183
All right.

1058
00:55:59,281 --> 00:56:00,180
Ready?

1059
00:56:00,279 --> 00:56:01,677
On ''go.''

1060
00:56:01,777 --> 00:56:04,373
Not on ''go.''
It's always on ''go.''

1061
00:56:04,473 --> 00:56:05,471
All right.

1062
00:56:05,671 --> 00:56:06,570
Hmm?

1063
00:56:06,670 --> 00:56:07,868
On ''triskaidekaphobia.''

1064
00:56:07,968 --> 00:56:09,366
Oh, that's a good one!

1065
00:56:09,465 --> 00:56:10,863
- All right, ready?
- Mm-hmm.

1066
00:56:10,963 --> 00:56:11,962
- Set?
- Mm-hmm.

1067
00:56:12,061 --> 00:56:13,759
Triskaidekaphobia!

1068
00:56:14,857 --> 00:56:16,455
Triskaidekaphobia!

1069
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:35,326
May I speak with your manager, please?

1070
00:56:35,426 --> 00:56:36,624
Tim?

1071
00:56:36,724 --> 00:56:38,721
This guy wants to talk to you.

1072
00:56:40,418 --> 00:56:42,515
May I help you?

1073
00:56:43,613 --> 00:56:46,209
It's an absolute honor.

1074
00:56:47,507 --> 00:56:48,606
Now, I do have

1075
00:56:48,705 --> 00:56:50,503
a question about the hot dog buns.

1076
00:56:50,603 --> 00:56:53,199
That's the last of'em.

1077
00:56:54,497 --> 00:56:56,394
37 seconds.

1078
00:56:56,494 --> 00:56:58,091
Great. Well done.

1079
00:56:58,191 --> 00:56:59,389
Now we wait.

1080
00:56:59,489 --> 00:57:03,683
No. We breathe.
We pulse. We regenerate.

1081
00:57:03,782 --> 00:57:06,378
Our hearts beat.
Our minds create.

1082
00:57:06,478 --> 00:57:08,974
Our souls ingest.

1083
00:57:09,074 --> 00:57:12,469
37 seconds, well used,
is a lifetime.

1084
00:57:27,846 --> 00:57:30,042
What mystifies me is
that no one knows, Mahoney.

1085
00:57:30,142 --> 00:57:32,638
You would think that someone
in the hot dog industry

1086
00:57:32,738 --> 00:57:35,534
would have some clue
about this obvious anomaly.

1087
00:57:35,634 --> 00:57:38,629
- Here is good.
- Here is good?

1088
00:57:40,127 --> 00:57:42,024
Mahoney...

1089
00:57:42,124 --> 00:57:44,021
I'm very confused.

1090
00:57:44,121 --> 00:57:45,019
Now what?

1091
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:46,317
Dance.

1092
00:58:25,458 --> 00:58:27,654
You are brilliant!

1093
00:58:38,138 --> 00:58:39,836
What a great last day!

1094
00:58:39,935 --> 00:58:42,132
Hmm?

1095
00:58:43,430 --> 00:58:45,227
Don't stop!

1096
00:58:45,327 --> 00:58:46,525
Dance longer!

1097
00:58:46,625 --> 00:58:48,722
No, it's okay, sir.

1098
00:58:48,822 --> 00:58:50,519
Mahoney, why have you done all this?

1099
00:58:50,619 --> 00:58:52,616
I wanted you to see
all the little things

1100
00:58:52,716 --> 00:58:54,014
you're gonna miss if you leave.

1101
00:58:54,114 --> 00:58:55,811
I see.

1102
00:58:55,911 --> 00:58:57,309
I thought

1103
00:58:57,409 --> 00:59:00,504
this was to be the best last day
of anyone who ever lived.

1104
00:59:00,604 --> 00:59:02,201
Sir, this can't be your last day.

1105
00:59:02,301 --> 00:59:04,298
Ah... but it is.

1106
00:59:04,398 --> 00:59:05,297
No.

1107
00:59:05,397 --> 00:59:06,595
And now,
thanks to you,

1108
00:59:06,695 --> 00:59:08,392
it looks to be a remarkable one.

1109
00:59:08,492 --> 00:59:11,787
All I have left to do
is use a public phone

1110
00:59:11,887 --> 00:59:13,384
and my life will be complete.

1111
00:59:20,773 --> 00:59:22,970
What?

1112
00:59:23,070 --> 00:59:24,967
Right here?

1113
00:59:25,067 --> 00:59:26,464
Oh, you're right.

1114
00:59:28,262 --> 00:59:30,259
You're a genius.

1115
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:31,956
Very good with numbers.

1116
00:59:32,056 --> 00:59:33,354
You should teach.

1117
00:59:33,454 --> 00:59:36,249
- Morning.
- Hi. Yes. Morning.

1118
00:59:36,349 --> 00:59:38,047
Wow, it's quiet today.

1119
00:59:38,147 --> 00:59:39,844
Yeah, yeah.

1120
00:59:39,944 --> 00:59:41,042
No one's been in.

1121
00:59:41,142 --> 00:59:42,939
Mahoney left.
Just been me thus far.

1122
00:59:43,039 --> 00:59:45,236
You've been here
all by yourself all morning?

1123
00:59:45,336 --> 00:59:46,434
Yeah.

1124
00:59:46,534 --> 00:59:48,331
And the store didn't collapse

1125
00:59:48,431 --> 00:59:50,028
around you?

1126
00:59:56,019 --> 00:59:58,116
- Yes.
- What are you doing?

1127
00:59:58,216 --> 01:00:01,111
I am taking down merchandise codes.

1128
01:00:01,211 --> 01:00:03,308
No. With Einstein.

1129
01:00:03,408 --> 01:00:04,706
With...?

1130
01:00:04,806 --> 01:00:07,302
With Einstein?

1131
01:00:07,402 --> 01:00:08,700
Einst... Oh.

1132
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:11,496
Just, I was fiddling.

1133
01:00:11,595 --> 01:00:13,093
Occupying my time.

1134
01:00:13,193 --> 01:00:14,294
You mean, pretending?

1135
01:00:14,394 --> 01:00:16,895
Wha... No, that's not...

1136
01:00:16,995 --> 01:00:19,096
Just keeping my mind active,

1137
01:00:19,196 --> 01:00:22,398
you know, when there wasn't
much else to think about.

1138
01:00:22,498 --> 01:00:23,699
Do you know what I mean?

1139
01:00:23,799 --> 01:00:24,799
Yeah.

1140
01:00:24,899 --> 01:00:25,900
Good.

1141
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,301
That's called pretending.

1142
01:00:30,502 --> 01:00:31,703
It's okay.

1143
01:00:31,803 --> 01:00:34,705
You can stay out here
and play with the toys, Mutant.

1144
01:00:34,805 --> 01:00:36,507
I won't tell anyone.

1145
01:00:39,709 --> 01:00:40,710
Here you go.

1146
01:00:40,810 --> 01:00:43,011
Great. Let's go.

1147
01:00:44,913 --> 01:00:46,814
Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium.

1148
01:00:46,914 --> 01:00:49,716
We sell toys.
We do not fix car transmissions.

1149
01:00:49,816 --> 01:00:51,517
Eric, I am calling

1150
01:00:51,617 --> 01:00:54,519
from a public phone!

1151
01:00:54,619 --> 01:00:56,521
Good for you, sir.

1152
01:00:56,621 --> 01:00:59,223
Now, I have two things
I must tell you.

1153
01:00:59,323 --> 01:01:01,324
Firstly, capital hat!

1154
01:01:03,325 --> 01:01:04,927
Thank you, sir.

1155
01:01:05,027 --> 01:01:06,328
And secondly,

1156
01:01:06,428 --> 01:01:08,929
I do wish you'd find some friends.

1157
01:01:09,030 --> 01:01:10,430
Okay?

1158
01:01:10,631 --> 01:01:12,132
Okay.

1159
01:01:12,232 --> 01:01:14,433
I love you.

1160
01:01:15,934 --> 01:01:17,636
Now, put the Mutant

1161
01:01:17,736 --> 01:01:18,936
on the phone.

1162
01:01:19,037 --> 01:01:21,939
Henry, the phone's for you.

1163
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:24,741
Hello?

1164
01:01:24,841 --> 01:01:26,242
Mutant, I have something

1165
01:01:26,342 --> 01:01:28,443
very, very supremely important
to tell you.

1166
01:01:28,543 --> 01:01:30,545
Please deposit an additional

1167
01:01:30,645 --> 01:01:31,545
3 5 cents.

1168
01:01:31,645 --> 01:01:32,546
Hello?

1169
01:01:33,947 --> 01:01:36,149
- Please deposit an additional
- Hello?

1170
01:01:36,349 --> 01:01:38,350
- 3 5 cents.
- Hello?

1171
01:01:38,450 --> 01:01:41,152
- Please deposit an additional
- Hello?

1172
01:01:41,252 --> 01:01:42,353
3 5 cents.

1173
01:01:48,357 --> 01:01:50,459
Oh, well, he'll figure it out.

1174
01:01:57,364 --> 01:02:00,966
Okay, try again.

1175
01:02:01,066 --> 01:02:02,567
Come on!

1176
01:02:04,869 --> 01:02:07,671
Come on, you're being ridiculous.

1177
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:11,574
You're gonna have to do it sometime.

1178
01:02:15,576 --> 01:02:17,178
Try again.

1179
01:02:20,380 --> 01:02:21,581
What are you doing?

1180
01:02:21,681 --> 01:02:22,781
We got a nervous Slinky.

1181
01:02:25,183 --> 01:02:26,384
We handled ourselves pretty well.

1182
01:02:26,484 --> 01:02:28,485
I think we make a good team.

1183
01:02:28,586 --> 01:02:29,886
Yeah, I think so.

1184
01:02:29,987 --> 01:02:32,288
The toys are still upset, though.

1185
01:02:32,388 --> 01:02:34,290
Yeah.

1186
01:02:34,390 --> 01:02:36,891
- Yeah.
- Should we call it a day?

1187
01:02:37,992 --> 01:02:39,493
Yes, it looks like it.

1188
01:02:39,593 --> 01:02:41,094
Good. Checkers.

1189
01:02:41,295 --> 01:02:42,195
What?

1190
01:02:42,395 --> 01:02:44,096
Checkers.

1191
01:02:44,297 --> 01:02:46,798
Uh, no, I got to get
back to the agency.

1192
01:02:46,999 --> 01:02:48,199
Come on, Henry.

1193
01:02:48,299 --> 01:02:49,801
One game.

1194
01:02:50,001 --> 01:02:51,902
Sorry. Some other time.

1195
01:02:52,002 --> 01:02:54,003
Just one?

1196
01:03:10,715 --> 01:03:12,016
Henry.

1197
01:03:12,116 --> 01:03:13,918
Yes, Eric?

1198
01:03:14,018 --> 01:03:15,919
Hey, um...

1199
01:03:16,019 --> 01:03:17,520
do you mind...

1200
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:18,821
Yes?

1201
01:03:18,921 --> 01:03:19,922
Well,

1202
01:03:20,122 --> 01:03:22,123
Mahoney usually
walks me home, and...

1203
01:03:22,323 --> 01:03:23,524
it's getting dark.

1204
01:03:23,624 --> 01:03:25,426
Do you want me to walk you home?

1205
01:03:25,526 --> 01:03:26,727
Thanks.

1206
01:03:28,328 --> 01:03:31,930
I got to ask you where
you get those hats from.

1207
01:03:32,030 --> 01:03:33,231
From my room.

1208
01:03:33,331 --> 01:03:36,333
Yeah? Every day I see you
in a different hat.

1209
01:03:36,433 --> 01:03:38,535
Yeah. I collect them.

1210
01:03:38,535 --> 01:03:40,636
You collect them, huh?

1211
01:03:40,736 --> 01:03:44,239
Mr. Magorium says I have
the neatest hat collection

1212
01:03:44,339 --> 01:03:45,440
he's ever seen.

1213
01:03:45,540 --> 01:03:48,342
I know people who,
you know, own several hats,

1214
01:03:48,542 --> 01:03:50,443
but I don't think
I've ever heard

1215
01:03:50,543 --> 01:03:54,146
of a hat collector before.

1216
01:03:56,047 --> 01:03:59,350
Do you want to see 'em?

1217
01:03:59,450 --> 01:04:01,951
Just try not to get too overwhelmed.

1218
01:04:02,051 --> 01:04:03,653
Got it.

1219
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:16,562
Oh, my.

1220
01:04:16,662 --> 01:04:19,264
Pretty neat, huh?

1221
01:04:19,364 --> 01:04:23,467
Eric, when you said a lot,
I was expecting, like, 20.

1222
01:04:23,667 --> 01:04:25,568
Oh, no-- I have more than that.

1223
01:04:25,768 --> 01:04:27,069
You wear all these?

1224
01:04:27,169 --> 01:04:28,370
Sure.

1225
01:04:28,470 --> 01:04:29,971
What good would they be
if I didn't wear 'em?

1226
01:04:30,171 --> 01:04:31,272
Wow.

1227
01:04:33,774 --> 01:04:35,175
You want to try one on?

1228
01:04:35,275 --> 01:04:37,977
No. Thank you. I'm fine.

1229
01:04:38,077 --> 01:04:39,778
- Henry.
- Yes?

1230
01:04:39,878 --> 01:04:43,080
I think we both know
you want to try a hat on.

1231
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:45,082
I don't know where to begin!

1232
01:04:45,182 --> 01:04:47,483
I don't know where to start! Oh...!

1233
01:04:47,584 --> 01:04:51,786
We have got to buy the dragon
a toothbrush, Your Excellency.

1234
01:04:51,887 --> 01:04:54,088
After devouring most
of the township,

1235
01:04:54,188 --> 01:04:55,789
his breath is just awful!

1236
01:04:55,989 --> 01:04:58,491
He ate the town?!

1237
01:04:58,591 --> 01:05:00,192
He ate the baker and his wife,

1238
01:05:00,292 --> 01:05:03,495
he ate... the woodsmith
and his three sons,

1239
01:05:03,595 --> 01:05:05,596
and then for sweets--
come closer--

1240
01:05:05,696 --> 01:05:07,097
he ate the cobbler.

1241
01:05:07,197 --> 01:05:08,999
Good idea, Fool!

1242
01:05:09,099 --> 01:05:10,800
Go brush the dragon's teeth!

1243
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:12,901
Me? He doesn't like me.

1244
01:05:13,001 --> 01:05:13,902
And...

1245
01:05:14,002 --> 01:05:15,203
What do you mean, ''and''?

1246
01:05:15,303 --> 01:05:16,404
And he's quite large.

1247
01:05:16,504 --> 01:05:18,205
And...

1248
01:05:18,305 --> 01:05:20,907
I look surprisingly like...

1249
01:05:21,007 --> 01:05:22,708
a toothpick from afar.

1250
01:05:22,808 --> 01:05:24,409
Eric?

1251
01:05:26,111 --> 01:05:27,612
Do you have someone...

1252
01:05:29,113 --> 01:05:30,214
Who's this?

1253
01:05:30,314 --> 01:05:31,715
The Mutant.

1254
01:05:31,815 --> 01:05:32,515
The what?

1255
01:05:32,715 --> 01:05:33,816
Uh, Henry.

1256
01:05:33,916 --> 01:05:36,118
Henry. Sorry. Henry.

1257
01:05:36,218 --> 01:05:37,519
Henry. Henry who?

1258
01:05:37,619 --> 01:05:40,321
Henry Weston.
I-I work at the...

1259
01:05:40,421 --> 01:05:42,422
What are you doing in my house?

1260
01:05:42,522 --> 01:05:45,224
Uh... I-I was pretending.

1261
01:05:45,324 --> 01:05:47,025
Don't be mean to him.

1262
01:05:47,125 --> 01:05:48,526
Henry's my friend.

1263
01:05:50,428 --> 01:05:51,929
I am?

1264
01:05:53,430 --> 01:05:54,731
Yeah.

1265
01:05:54,831 --> 01:05:56,532
Cool.

1266
01:05:56,632 --> 01:05:58,734
A little old, don't you think,

1267
01:05:58,834 --> 01:05:59,934
to be playing dress-up?

1268
01:06:00,035 --> 01:06:01,736
Yes, yes. Absolutely.

1269
01:06:01,936 --> 01:06:03,037
Sorry. And it is late.

1270
01:06:03,137 --> 01:06:05,038
I have some work
I needed to do,

1271
01:06:05,138 --> 01:06:07,340
I should be doing,
I will be doing now.

1272
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:08,941
- See you later.
- Don't you have chores, Eric?

1273
01:06:09,041 --> 01:06:12,143
You know, actually, he worked
all day at the store...

1274
01:06:12,243 --> 01:06:14,044
I thought you said you were leaving.

1275
01:06:14,144 --> 01:06:16,946
Certainly.
Excuse me. See ya.

1276
01:06:54,273 --> 01:06:56,174
Well, Mahoney...

1277
01:06:56,274 --> 01:06:57,775
Don't go.

1278
01:06:57,875 --> 01:07:00,477
My darling.

1279
01:07:00,577 --> 01:07:02,278
I'm not ready.

1280
01:07:03,479 --> 01:07:06,181
I'm not ready for it to end.

1281
01:07:06,281 --> 01:07:08,983
I'm sorry.

1282
01:07:20,892 --> 01:07:23,193
When King Lear dies in Act 5,

1283
01:07:23,293 --> 01:07:25,495
do you know what Shakespeare
has written?

1284
01:07:25,595 --> 01:07:29,498
He's written, ''He dies.''

1285
01:07:29,598 --> 01:07:31,599
That's all, nothing more.

1286
01:07:31,699 --> 01:07:36,102
No fanfare, no metaphor,
no brilliant final words.

1287
01:07:36,202 --> 01:07:39,004
The culmination
of the most influential work

1288
01:07:39,104 --> 01:07:43,307
of dramatic literature is:
''He dies.''

1289
01:07:45,809 --> 01:07:48,511
It takes Shakespeare, a genius,
to come up with ''He dies.''

1290
01:07:51,713 --> 01:07:54,915
And yet every time
I read those two words,

1291
01:07:55,016 --> 01:07:58,918
I find myself overwhelmed
with dysphoria.

1292
01:07:59,018 --> 01:08:01,720
And I know it's only
natural to be sad,

1293
01:08:01,820 --> 01:08:04,122
but not because
of the words ''He dies,''

1294
01:08:04,222 --> 01:08:08,325
but because of the life we saw
prior to the words.

1295
01:08:13,929 --> 01:08:17,832
I've lived all five
of my acts, Mahoney,

1296
01:08:17,932 --> 01:08:21,734
and I am not asking you
to be happy that I must go.

1297
01:08:21,834 --> 01:08:23,436
I'm only asking
that you

1298
01:08:23,536 --> 01:08:25,437
turn the page,

1299
01:08:25,537 --> 01:08:28,039
continue reading...

1300
01:08:28,139 --> 01:08:30,541
and let the next story begin.

1301
01:08:30,641 --> 01:08:35,244
And if anyone ever asks
what became of me,

1302
01:08:35,344 --> 01:08:37,345
you relate my life

1303
01:08:37,445 --> 01:08:39,347
in all its wonder,

1304
01:08:39,447 --> 01:08:45,351
and end it with
a simple and modest ''He died.''

1305
01:08:47,252 --> 01:08:49,354
I love you.

1306
01:08:55,458 --> 01:08:57,259
I love you, too.

1307
01:09:06,466 --> 01:09:10,369
Your life is an occasion.

1308
01:09:10,469 --> 01:09:12,370
Rise to it.

1309
01:10:53,041 --> 01:10:55,341
Good-bye, my love.

1310
01:12:24,936 --> 01:12:27,936
I-It's... not that bad.

1311
01:12:28,036 --> 01:12:31,036
We can bring it back.

1312
01:12:31,136 --> 01:12:32,436
Right, Mahoney?

1313
01:12:32,536 --> 01:12:35,036
Mahoney?

1314
01:12:35,136 --> 01:12:36,836
Let's just run the store and...

1315
01:12:36,936 --> 01:12:38,136
see if it picks up.

1316
01:12:38,236 --> 01:12:40,535
- I'm sorry, Eric.
- I'll help you.

1317
01:12:40,635 --> 01:12:42,035
Just don't leave.

1318
01:12:42,135 --> 01:12:44,435
- Eric...
- Mahoney, don't leave.

1319
01:12:44,535 --> 01:12:46,035
I'm sorry.

1320
01:12:46,135 --> 01:12:48,535
It just needs a little magic.

1321
01:12:48,735 --> 01:12:50,735
I know.

1322
01:12:50,835 --> 01:12:52,935
I don't have any.

1323
01:13:42,032 --> 01:13:44,232
<i>This chapter is called</i>

1324
01:13:44,332 --> 01:13:46,332
<i>''A New Beginning. ''</i>

1325
01:14:22,030 --> 01:14:23,030
Eric?

1326
01:14:23,130 --> 01:14:24,430
What are you doing?

1327
01:14:24,530 --> 01:14:26,630
I'm playing ''JenniferJuniper.''

1328
01:14:26,730 --> 01:14:27,730
Why?

1329
01:14:27,930 --> 01:14:29,930
Because someone requested it.

1330
01:14:30,030 --> 01:14:31,830
No, why are you here?

1331
01:14:31,930 --> 01:14:34,029
Because I have to make money, Eric.

1332
01:14:34,129 --> 01:14:35,429
Then run the store.

1333
01:14:35,529 --> 01:14:37,029
I can't.

1334
01:14:37,129 --> 01:14:38,329
Look.

1335
01:14:38,429 --> 01:14:40,729
I would love to run the store,
but I can't.

1336
01:14:40,829 --> 01:14:41,929
I'm not Mr. Magorium.

1337
01:14:42,029 --> 01:14:43,529
Is that why it's for sale?

1338
01:14:43,629 --> 01:14:44,829
Yeah.

1339
01:14:44,929 --> 01:14:46,129
Look, I'm sorry.

1340
01:14:46,229 --> 01:14:48,429
I didn't mean to let you down.

1341
01:14:48,529 --> 01:14:49,529
Is this what you want?

1342
01:14:49,629 --> 01:14:51,129
No...

1343
01:14:51,229 --> 01:14:54,128
No, but I don't know
how to do anything else.

1344
01:14:54,228 --> 01:14:55,628
Stop saying that.

1345
01:14:55,728 --> 01:14:58,828
Eric, I understand
this is hard for you.

1346
01:14:58,928 --> 01:15:01,428
This is really hard for me, too.

1347
01:15:03,028 --> 01:15:05,828
But I cannot be a kid anymore.

1348
01:15:05,928 --> 01:15:08,528
That's why Mr. Magorium
gave you the store.

1349
01:15:28,527 --> 01:15:30,127
My Lord...

1350
01:15:30,227 --> 01:15:31,926
no wonder you're
going out of business.

1351
01:15:32,026 --> 01:15:33,126
It's... depressing.

1352
01:15:33,326 --> 01:15:34,426
Can I play over there?

1353
01:15:34,526 --> 01:15:35,526
- Sure.
- What? No...

1354
01:15:35,626 --> 01:15:36,726
Jack, please don't touch anything.

1355
01:15:36,826 --> 01:15:39,226
Actually, ma'am, it's okay.

1356
01:15:39,326 --> 01:15:40,926
He can play with anything he likes.

1357
01:15:41,026 --> 01:15:43,726
Let me show you the
spiral staircases here.

1358
01:15:43,826 --> 01:15:45,226
Do you know how it works?

1359
01:15:47,426 --> 01:15:48,726
Okay, I'll show you.

1360
01:15:50,925 --> 01:15:52,725
Cool. That's neat.

1361
01:15:52,825 --> 01:15:55,025
Yeah...
It's a magnet.

1362
01:15:55,125 --> 01:15:56,725
How does a magnet work?

1363
01:15:56,825 --> 01:15:58,325
I don't know.

1364
01:15:58,425 --> 01:15:59,525
It's, uh...

1365
01:15:59,625 --> 01:16:01,825
Is it magic?

1366
01:16:05,325 --> 01:16:07,325
Well...

1367
01:16:07,425 --> 01:16:10,924
I believe it is.

1368
01:16:13,824 --> 01:16:15,524
...leads to the apartments upstairs.

1369
01:16:15,624 --> 01:16:17,324
They're an excellent
source of income.

1370
01:16:17,424 --> 01:16:19,524
Those planets and the rocket...

1371
01:16:19,624 --> 01:16:21,024
I have to say--

1372
01:16:21,124 --> 01:16:23,524
the use of this space is
completely impractical.

1373
01:16:23,624 --> 01:16:25,624
It...

1374
01:16:25,724 --> 01:16:28,023
it wasn't built for practicality.

1375
01:16:28,123 --> 01:16:29,723
Oh.

1376
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:32,923
Well, it certainly is a large
enough space for the price.

1377
01:16:33,023 --> 01:16:34,823
Are the fixtures included?

1378
01:16:34,923 --> 01:16:38,623
Yeah-- the cash register...

1379
01:16:38,723 --> 01:16:41,823
the slide, the tree,
the planets,

1380
01:16:41,923 --> 01:16:45,523
the rocket ship,
the Door of Rooms...

1381
01:16:45,723 --> 01:16:46,923
Okay!

1382
01:16:47,023 --> 01:16:48,522
Great.

1383
01:16:48,622 --> 01:16:50,322
Well, I'll let you know.

1384
01:16:50,422 --> 01:16:52,322
Okay,Jack, honey?

1385
01:16:52,422 --> 01:16:54,322
- Come on, we're leaving.
- Mom, you gotta see this!

1386
01:16:54,422 --> 01:16:56,622
You know what?
I don't have time for this.

1387
01:16:56,722 --> 01:16:59,022
Mommy's got a lot of
other properties to see.

1388
01:16:59,122 --> 01:17:01,122
Rub that in.
Okay.

1389
01:17:01,222 --> 01:17:02,622
We'll be in touch.

1390
01:17:02,722 --> 01:17:04,922
Mommy, it's magic!

1391
01:17:31,420 --> 01:17:32,720
Eric?

1392
01:17:32,820 --> 01:17:35,520
I'm here to make you a
substantial offer for the store.

1393
01:17:35,620 --> 01:17:37,120
What?

1394
01:17:37,220 --> 01:17:40,720
Although I am unable to offer
the full amount and I'm nine,

1395
01:17:40,820 --> 01:17:43,620
I think you may be interested
in my proposal.

1396
01:17:45,719 --> 01:17:47,219
The following simply states

1397
01:17:47,319 --> 01:17:50,819
that I can offer Mahoney
a down payment

1398
01:17:51,019 --> 01:17:53,719
of $237 in pennies,

1399
01:17:53,819 --> 01:17:56,719
nickels, dimes and a Christmas
check from my grandma.

1400
01:17:56,819 --> 01:17:59,919
And then I am willing
to pay you

1401
01:18:00,019 --> 01:18:01,519
my allowance
and a hefty percentage

1402
01:18:01,619 --> 01:18:04,218
of the store's profit
on a weekly basis.

1403
01:18:04,318 --> 01:18:06,218
Keep in mind that my age
works as a benefit,

1404
01:18:06,318 --> 01:18:08,818
as it means that I have
more weeks left

1405
01:18:08,918 --> 01:18:11,118
in my life than
the typical buyer,

1406
01:18:11,218 --> 01:18:13,118
which means more allowances.

1407
01:18:13,218 --> 01:18:14,418
Why are you doing this?

1408
01:18:14,518 --> 01:18:16,118
I...

1409
01:18:16,218 --> 01:18:17,918
want to get into
the real estate game.

1410
01:18:18,018 --> 01:18:20,018
Flip a few properties,

1411
01:18:20,118 --> 01:18:21,918
make my mark on the city.

1412
01:18:22,018 --> 01:18:23,417
Eric...

1413
01:18:23,517 --> 01:18:25,317
The only thing we can invest in

1414
01:18:25,417 --> 01:18:26,717
- is the future.
- Buddy...

1415
01:18:26,817 --> 01:18:27,817
- I want to...
- Eric.

1416
01:18:27,917 --> 01:18:30,717
Stop.

1417
01:18:32,817 --> 01:18:35,717
I don't want someone else
to have the store, all right?

1418
01:18:35,817 --> 01:18:37,917
I don't want it to change.

1419
01:18:38,017 --> 01:18:39,617
Okay. All right.

1420
01:18:39,717 --> 01:18:41,517
I'll throw in my hat collection.

1421
01:18:41,617 --> 01:18:43,216
Don't throw in your hat collection.

1422
01:18:43,316 --> 01:18:44,916
But there has to be something.

1423
01:18:45,016 --> 01:18:47,616
Please.

1424
01:18:47,716 --> 01:18:51,116
She's about to make
a terrible mistake, Mutant.

1425
01:18:51,216 --> 01:18:54,916
We can't let her do that.

1426
01:18:55,016 --> 01:18:57,416
As my friend...

1427
01:18:59,416 --> 01:19:04,215
...help me... please.

1428
01:19:34,514 --> 01:19:37,114
- Hi.
- Hello.

1429
01:19:38,914 --> 01:19:40,313
Wow.

1430
01:19:40,413 --> 01:19:42,513
What happened in here?

1431
01:19:42,613 --> 01:19:46,613
I don't think you'd understand.

1432
01:19:46,713 --> 01:19:49,413
Well, I've got news.

1433
01:19:49,513 --> 01:19:50,913
Yeah?

1434
01:19:51,013 --> 01:19:52,813
You've got an offer on the store.

1435
01:19:52,913 --> 01:19:56,513
It's a good offer.
Cash offer.

1436
01:19:56,613 --> 01:19:59,112
From the lady earlier today.

1437
01:19:59,312 --> 01:20:01,412
Wow.

1438
01:20:01,512 --> 01:20:02,612
I know it's late,

1439
01:20:02,712 --> 01:20:03,812
but the woman's very aggressive.

1440
01:20:04,012 --> 01:20:05,812
I thought you should
look it over tonight

1441
01:20:05,912 --> 01:20:07,912
and come up with a decision
by tomorrow morning.

1442
01:20:08,012 --> 01:20:10,013
Okay.

1443
01:20:12,814 --> 01:20:14,215
Do you think I should take it?

1444
01:20:14,315 --> 01:20:16,416
Well...

1445
01:20:16,516 --> 01:20:18,317
Do you think I should take it?

1446
01:20:18,417 --> 01:20:21,618
In my professional opinion,

1447
01:20:21,718 --> 01:20:23,819
it is a very unique offer

1448
01:20:23,919 --> 01:20:26,120
and it's a lot more
than we expected.

1449
01:20:26,220 --> 01:20:27,921
I-I... I think
you'd be a fool

1450
01:20:28,021 --> 01:20:30,822
not to take it.

1451
01:20:32,623 --> 01:20:36,224
But I am not here as a professional.

1452
01:20:38,325 --> 01:20:40,626
I'm here as your friend.

1453
01:20:40,726 --> 01:20:42,827
And I think
you should keep the store.

1454
01:20:42,927 --> 01:20:44,728
You don't even believe
in this store.

1455
01:20:44,828 --> 01:20:46,529
- No, but...
- I... I can't.

1456
01:20:46,629 --> 01:20:49,930
I want to, but I just can't.

1457
01:20:50,030 --> 01:20:51,331
You ''just'' can't.

1458
01:20:51,431 --> 01:20:55,233
Yeah. I guess not.

1459
01:20:55,333 --> 01:20:57,234
What do you got there?

1460
01:20:57,334 --> 01:20:58,834
Oh, it's the Congreve Cube.

1461
01:20:58,934 --> 01:21:02,936
It's supposed to help me unlock
some great mystery or something.

1462
01:21:03,036 --> 01:21:06,137
- Looks like a block of wood.
- It is.

1463
01:21:06,238 --> 01:21:08,539
Are you supposed to unlock
a mystery with a block of wood?

1464
01:21:08,639 --> 01:21:10,239
It's a magical
block of wood, Mutant.

1465
01:21:10,339 --> 01:21:12,640
It's a block of wood that
probably, in the right hands,

1466
01:21:12,740 --> 01:21:15,342
would reveal some greatness that...

1467
01:21:15,442 --> 01:21:17,242
we can't even imagine.

1468
01:21:17,342 --> 01:21:18,843
That's impossible.

1469
01:21:18,943 --> 01:21:21,144
This is what you don't understand.

1470
01:21:21,244 --> 01:21:22,745
What you have somehow missed.

1471
01:21:22,845 --> 01:21:24,245
Every minute

1472
01:21:24,345 --> 01:21:27,147
of every day in every corner
of this store,

1473
01:21:27,247 --> 01:21:29,148
what happened was the impossible.

1474
01:21:29,248 --> 01:21:30,748
Do you honestly
believe all that stuff?

1475
01:21:30,848 --> 01:21:32,449
- Yes!
- That this store was magic?

1476
01:21:32,549 --> 01:21:33,850
You never saw it.

1477
01:21:33,950 --> 01:21:35,650
That that block of wood is more
than just a block of wood?

1478
01:21:35,750 --> 01:21:36,651
Absolutely.

1479
01:21:36,751 --> 01:21:38,752
I believe it with my entire heart.

1480
01:21:38,852 --> 01:21:41,453
But the disheartening truth

1481
01:21:41,553 --> 01:21:43,854
is that only Mr. Magorium
could make it so.

1482
01:21:43,954 --> 01:21:46,555
- Um...
- It was his Emporium, not mine.

1483
01:21:46,755 --> 01:21:48,356
-J-Just, uh...
- Look, I appreciate

1484
01:21:48,456 --> 01:21:51,858
-you coming here, but it's over.
- Say that thing

1485
01:21:51,958 --> 01:21:54,059
about that block of wood
that's not magic.

1486
01:21:54,159 --> 01:21:55,959
It is magic.

1487
01:21:56,059 --> 01:21:58,761
- What is wrong with you, Mutant?
- Say it one more time,

1488
01:21:58,861 --> 01:22:00,461
that that's more
than just a block of wood.

1489
01:22:00,561 --> 01:22:04,663
It is absolutely more
than just a block of woo...

1490
01:22:04,763 --> 01:22:06,664
Well, it moves, for one thing.

1491
01:22:09,065 --> 01:22:11,066
Move.

1492
01:22:13,167 --> 01:22:15,668
Come on, you can
do better than that.

1493
01:22:15,768 --> 01:22:16,869
Move!

1494
01:22:19,970 --> 01:22:21,571
All right.
Don't worry.

1495
01:22:21,671 --> 01:22:24,872
If you fall, I'll just
pick you right back up.

1496
01:22:24,972 --> 01:22:26,173
Move.

1497
01:23:16,895 --> 01:23:18,796
No way.

1498
01:23:23,598 --> 01:23:25,399
<i>This chapter is called</i>

1499
01:23:25,499 --> 01:23:28,000
<i>''You Have to Believe It to See It...</i>

1500
01:23:28,100 --> 01:23:30,601
<i>Or Messing with the Mutant. ''</i>

1501
01:23:35,203 --> 01:23:37,204
MAHONEY Mutant.

1502
01:23:37,304 --> 01:23:38,804
Mutant.

1503
01:23:38,905 --> 01:23:40,305
You gotta wake up, Sleeping Beauty.

1504
01:23:40,405 --> 01:23:42,506
There are people here.

1505
01:23:42,606 --> 01:23:44,307
Mm... What?

1506
01:23:44,307 --> 01:23:47,608
Wakey, wakey, eggs and bakey.

1507
01:23:47,708 --> 01:23:49,009
Hi.

1508
01:23:49,109 --> 01:23:50,310
Morning.

1509
01:23:50,410 --> 01:23:51,710
I'm sorry
to wake you up,

1510
01:23:51,810 --> 01:23:53,111
but you've slept long enough.

1511
01:23:53,211 --> 01:23:54,711
What's wrong with your head?

1512
01:23:54,811 --> 01:23:56,312
It hurts.
I hit it pretty hard.

1513
01:23:56,412 --> 01:23:57,513
You did?

1514
01:23:57,613 --> 01:23:59,113
Yeah, it must've been
when I passed out.

1515
01:23:59,213 --> 01:24:00,614
What do you mean?

1516
01:24:00,714 --> 01:24:02,515
When I keeled over.

1517
01:24:02,615 --> 01:24:03,915
I didn't see that.

1518
01:24:04,016 --> 01:24:05,516
Yes, you did.
Last night.

1519
01:24:05,616 --> 01:24:07,217
Last night?
I went home.

1520
01:24:07,317 --> 01:24:09,518
No, no, before...

1521
01:24:09,618 --> 01:24:11,319
I passed out.

1522
01:24:11,419 --> 01:24:13,720
I think you must be confused.

1523
01:24:13,820 --> 01:24:15,020
No, no.

1524
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:17,021
I passed out.
I remember.

1525
01:24:17,121 --> 01:24:18,522
It was after the cube flew.

1526
01:24:18,622 --> 01:24:21,023
- What cube?
- ''What cube?''

1527
01:24:24,725 --> 01:24:26,826
Mahoney.
The Congreve Cube.

1528
01:24:27,026 --> 01:24:29,127
You made it fly all around the room.

1529
01:24:29,227 --> 01:24:30,927
I think you must
have dreamt all that.

1530
01:24:31,027 --> 01:24:33,428
I left you here to finalize
the real estate paperwork.

1531
01:24:33,528 --> 01:24:35,229
- Maybe you got sleepy.
- No, no, no, no.

1532
01:24:35,329 --> 01:24:37,130
I-I-I didn't.
Positively not.

1533
01:24:37,230 --> 01:24:39,631
I passed out
after you made that cube fly.

1534
01:24:39,731 --> 01:24:41,132
It doesn't matter.

1535
01:24:41,232 --> 01:24:43,633
- I'm selling the store.
- What?

1536
01:24:43,733 --> 01:24:45,534
Yeah, remember the offer?

1537
01:24:45,634 --> 01:24:47,134
We're signing the deal this morning.

1538
01:24:47,234 --> 01:24:48,335
No, no. Hey, hey.
You can't.

1539
01:24:48,435 --> 01:24:49,535
Why can't I?

1540
01:24:49,636 --> 01:24:51,736
Because this, it's...
it's magic!

1541
01:24:51,837 --> 01:24:53,137
You really think
this store is magic?

1542
01:24:53,237 --> 01:24:54,738
Yes. Yes, I do.

1543
01:24:54,838 --> 01:24:57,239
Isn't that just a little
difficult to believe?

1544
01:24:57,339 --> 01:24:59,240
No, no, I don't...
I don't think so.

1545
01:24:59,340 --> 01:25:00,240
No, not at all.

1546
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:01,841
Now...

1547
01:25:01,941 --> 01:25:05,943
I believe that you can make it
be anything that you want.

1548
01:25:07,343 --> 01:25:08,744
It's you.

1549
01:25:08,844 --> 01:25:10,545
You...

1550
01:25:10,645 --> 01:25:11,845
are a block of wood.

1551
01:25:11,945 --> 01:25:13,846
I'm a block of wood?

1552
01:25:13,946 --> 01:25:15,447
Yeah, Mahoney. It's you.

1553
01:25:15,547 --> 01:25:18,348
And what you need to
believe in is not the cube,

1554
01:25:18,448 --> 01:25:21,449
and it's not the store,
and it's not me.

1555
01:25:21,550 --> 01:25:24,551
What you need to believe in is you.

1556
01:25:28,152 --> 01:25:30,854
Holy cow.

1557
01:25:30,954 --> 01:25:33,255
What is it?

1558
01:25:33,355 --> 01:25:35,456
A sparkle.

1559
01:26:12,872 --> 01:26:15,273
- Wow!
- Cool.

1560
01:26:49,688 --> 01:26:52,389
Whoa...

1561
01:26:54,090 --> 01:26:57,792
Whoa!

1562
01:28:07,722 --> 01:28:10,023
- I can't believe it.
- Incredible.

1563
01:28:12,625 --> 01:28:16,726

Not bad.
