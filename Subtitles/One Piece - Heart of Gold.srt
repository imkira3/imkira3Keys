1
00:00:27,033 --> 00:00:29,025
How many times do I have to tell you?!

2
00:00:29,058 --> 00:00:33,044
I said "I just wanna eat meat"!

3
00:00:33,088 --> 00:00:34,073
I'm sorry!

4
00:00:34,084 --> 00:00:40,000
Boy! If you don't have any meat,
bring me more candies and stuff!

5
00:00:42,812 --> 00:00:46,138
It's still gonna take a while
before we reach Mariejois!

6
00:00:46,247 --> 00:00:48,380
We don't know when we'll be attacked!

7
00:00:49,258 --> 00:00:52,263
--Everybody, keep up your guard!
--Yes, sir!

8
00:01:09,912 --> 00:01:12,875
I managed to get out of that crappy place

9
00:01:12,891 --> 00:01:16,839
but I got caught by these crappy people...

10
00:01:16,857 --> 00:01:19,863
Crap!

11
00:01:20,898 --> 00:01:23,890
I've been looking for a
chance to escape but...

12
00:01:27,589 --> 00:01:29,630
...no luck.

13
00:01:29,662 --> 00:01:31,648
I can hear you.

14
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:34,340
Where did you hide the Pure Gold?

15
00:01:34,846 --> 00:01:37,861
Humph! I wouldn't tell you even if I knew!

16
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:39,943
Is the World Government looking for the

17
00:01:39,968 --> 00:01:43,568
treasure that's worth enough
to buy the whole world?

18
00:01:43,847 --> 00:01:46,435
How greedy is that? But...

19
00:01:46,461 --> 00:01:48,509
...it's all mine.

20
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:53,418
Because I'm greedier than you!

21
00:02:01,085 --> 00:02:03,007
What?!

22
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:10,980
What?! What's going on?!

23
00:02:11,132 --> 00:02:12,613
Get back!

24
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:15,034
Okay...

25
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:21,075
This is my chance to escape.

26
00:02:21,446 --> 00:02:22,483
We can hear you!

27
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,881
Take evasive action!

28
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:33,791
We can't see where they're
attacking from at all!

29
00:02:33,911 --> 00:02:36,914
How can you not see your
enemy ship on the water?!

30
00:02:37,733 --> 00:02:38,752
Where is it?

31
00:02:39,343 --> 00:02:41,408
Where are they attacking from?!

32
00:02:49,849 --> 00:02:50,849
Hey!

33
00:02:51,076 --> 00:02:53,687
Don't you see anything up there?!

34
00:02:53,713 --> 00:02:56,681
I don't! I don't see a thing!

35
00:03:04,547 --> 00:03:05,574
Who are you?!

36
00:03:06,756 --> 00:03:09,393
I was born in the North Blue

37
00:03:09,418 --> 00:03:14,400
I ate the Color-Color Fruit
and became a camouflage human

38
00:03:16,082 --> 00:03:20,082
Psycho P!

39
00:03:32,783 --> 00:03:34,767
Are you surprised?

40
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:37,843
My cool graffiti!

41
00:03:44,577 --> 00:03:46,586
I hope you know.

42
00:03:46,695 --> 00:03:52,416
Tesoro-sama is very interested
in the Pure Gold.

43
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:53,666
So be sure...

44
00:03:54,527 --> 00:03:57,080
...not to kill the girl.

45
00:03:57,101 --> 00:03:58,674
Shut up.

46
00:04:02,195 --> 00:04:04,237
You're sobering me up.

47
00:04:04,768 --> 00:04:08,812
I won't do something like sink a treasure.

48
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:25,672
Four warships aren't enough to stop me.

49
00:04:28,074 --> 00:04:31,059
Mad Anchor!

50
00:04:40,536 --> 00:04:42,557
Camoufla-paint!

51
00:04:50,091 --> 00:04:53,007
Hey! Where are you?!

52
00:04:56,198 --> 00:05:01,225
Your never-give-up attitude isn't half bad!

53
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:16,452
Naomi...

54
00:05:19,203 --> 00:05:20,240
Psycho P...

55
00:05:21,093 --> 00:05:24,000
Hey, my boss...

56
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:33,295
It's a treasure hunt!

57
00:05:35,454 --> 00:05:37,522
That hurts! I said "That hurts"!

58
00:05:38,238 --> 00:05:41,229
We can't let you have it.

59
00:05:41,276 --> 00:05:44,069
The Pure Gold belongs
to the World Government!

60
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:47,864
No! The Pure Gold is all...

61
00:05:47,891 --> 00:05:49,966
...mine!

62
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:58,165
I found you, Myskina Olga...

63
00:05:58,304 --> 00:06:00,386
You're the key to the Pure Gold!

64
00:06:15,084 --> 00:06:18,092
You're quite strong.

65
00:06:18,092 --> 00:06:21,016
Are you one of those Devil Fruit eaters?

66
00:06:22,321 --> 00:06:24,356
You want the Pure Gold too, don't you?

67
00:06:25,516 --> 00:06:27,551
I can show you the way if you want.

68
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:33,601
You're unexpectedly obedient, young lady.

69
00:06:34,098 --> 00:06:39,197
But only if you can get me out of here.

70
00:06:39,217 --> 00:06:41,502
Stop! Don't speak so freely.

71
00:06:42,035 --> 00:06:44,046
How did you know about the girl?!

72
00:06:44,338 --> 00:06:50,340
I have a patron who gives me
information about the Government.

73
00:06:50,741 --> 00:06:51,747
Who is it?!

74
00:06:54,348 --> 00:06:56,429
I'm not obliged to answer that!

75
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:03,462
I can't believe they sent
out Cipher Pol "Aigis" Zero.

76
00:07:04,525 --> 00:07:09,542
I guess the Celestial Dragons are desperate
to have the Pure Gold, aren't they?!

77
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:12,818
I don't need to answer that!

78
00:07:19,074 --> 00:07:25,047
They're fighting really hard.
This is my chance to run.

79
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,838
We can hear you!

80
00:07:34,258 --> 00:07:37,302
Chain Hammer!

81
00:08:03,493 --> 00:08:06,508
There's nowhere to run now, Little Betty

82
00:08:12,934 --> 00:08:14,407
What the...?!

83
00:08:14,451 --> 00:08:16,657
He has some strange ability.

84
00:08:19,924 --> 00:08:22,859
You'd better give up now.

85
00:08:23,714 --> 00:08:30,716
All right, take us to the
legendary island, Alchemi!

86
00:08:31,203 --> 00:08:35,713
I don't like classless guys like you!

87
00:08:36,097 --> 00:08:38,088
Elizabeth!

88
00:08:41,781 --> 00:08:44,773
Idiot! There is a place to run!

89
00:08:52,561 --> 00:08:54,542
Idiot! Idiot!

90
00:08:56,201 --> 00:08:58,174
She's got an associate.

91
00:08:58,757 --> 00:08:59,755
Don't kill her.

92
00:09:01,844 --> 00:09:05,834
This is interesting.
Let's let her go for now.

93
00:09:14,758 --> 00:09:16,798
Will it be okay?

94
00:09:17,236 --> 00:09:19,174
You sure?

95
00:09:20,859 --> 00:09:23,785
Tell Tesoro...

96
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:26,835
...that I'll get the Pure Gold at any price!

97
00:09:29,008 --> 00:09:33,026
All right, then I'm gonna
go back to Grantesoro.

98
00:09:33,598 --> 00:09:36,600
This will tell you where it's anchored.

99
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:40,360
There is a Vivre Card of Tesoro-sama inside.

100
00:09:41,752 --> 00:09:45,753
He said he'll pay whatever
you want as a reward.

101
00:09:45,856 --> 00:09:47,850
I don't care about money.

102
00:09:48,898 --> 00:09:52,847
I have no interest
in the treasures that I've gotten already.

103
00:09:53,606 --> 00:09:58,612
They're already dead to me.
They don't excite me at all.

104
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:04,007
I'm a treasure hunter.

105
00:10:04,095 --> 00:10:08,359
I just wanna be drunk on the
excitement of the moment

106
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:11,396
when I find a treasure!

107
00:10:15,857 --> 00:10:17,888
I'm sorry.

108
00:10:18,321 --> 00:10:20,609
We were attacked by Mad Treasure.

109
00:10:20,772 --> 00:10:24,707
And we let Myskina Olga escape.

110
00:10:25,446 --> 00:10:27,440
Find her no matter what.

111
00:10:28,186 --> 00:10:32,421
If you let anybody else have the Pure Gold,

112
00:10:32,608 --> 00:10:34,589
you know what'll happen to you.

113
00:10:34,806 --> 00:10:35,796
Yes, sir.

114
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:07,147
A gentle smile and a dignified smile

115
00:11:07,287 --> 00:11:12,297
Your adorable smile

116
00:11:14,217 --> 00:11:20,222
Silver hearts and gold hearts

117
00:11:20,371 --> 00:11:25,387
I'll give them all to you

118
00:11:27,555 --> 00:11:33,547
Alchemi, Alchema

119
00:11:33,555 --> 00:11:39,558
Hold the gold star

120
00:11:39,682 --> 00:11:45,722
Alchemi, Alchema

121
00:11:45,894 --> 00:11:57,842
Go into a dream

122
00:12:03,929 --> 00:12:08,932
Now I managed to escape but
I'll die of hunger like this.

123
00:12:10,174 --> 00:12:12,166
I gotta do something.

124
00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:21,029
What's that straw hat symbol?

125
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:24,935
Are they pirates?

126
00:12:30,068 --> 00:12:32,132
That pirate looks like an idiot.

127
00:12:33,351 --> 00:12:35,393
He looks weak.

128
00:12:42,968 --> 00:12:45,289
Chopper-san, are you alright?!

129
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:46,384
Yeah!

130
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,438
I'm gonna fish more!

131
00:12:49,099 --> 00:12:52,043
Alright, I'm gonna fish more too!

132
00:12:56,503 --> 00:12:59,503
Look! A lizard is running on the water!

133
00:13:00,177 --> 00:13:01,953
How can you do that?

134
00:13:02,534 --> 00:13:05,668
You put your left leg forward
before your right leg sinks.

135
00:13:05,768 --> 00:13:07,686
I can do that.

136
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:11,464
A girl is on its back!

137
00:13:11,489 --> 00:13:14,449
Seems like she's unconscious!
We gotta save her!

138
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,912
Leave it to me!

139
00:13:28,496 --> 00:13:30,465
--Now's your chance!
--Yeah!

140
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:41,525
Yes!

141
00:13:42,212 --> 00:13:43,214
What?!

142
00:13:43,253 --> 00:13:45,063
What is it this time?!

143
00:13:45,138 --> 00:13:46,142
Oh?

144
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:52,345
What are a lizard and a kid doing here?

145
00:13:52,442 --> 00:13:55,463
You're causing us more trouble.

146
00:13:57,225 --> 00:13:58,686
How did they get here?

147
00:13:59,218 --> 00:14:01,187
I caught them.

148
00:14:08,438 --> 00:14:10,139
It's strange...

149
00:14:10,218 --> 00:14:12,308
What? Is something wrong with her?

150
00:14:12,956 --> 00:14:14,421
It's odd!

151
00:14:14,504 --> 00:14:17,981
I don't see any wound and her pulse is stable

152
00:14:18,015 --> 00:14:21,030
so I don't think she's in a
life-threatening condition...

153
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:23,968
Is she just sleeping, then?

154
00:14:25,576 --> 00:14:29,024
You don't wanna sleep here.
You're gonna catch cold.

155
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:31,327
Okay, let's just wake her up!

156
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,738
You're up!

157
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:41,246
Thank you for saving me...

158
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,927
Don't move!

159
00:14:49,857 --> 00:14:51,049
Oh, she's good.

160
00:14:51,078 --> 00:14:53,087
Elizabeth! Come here!

161
00:14:53,133 --> 00:14:58,133
All right, don't try to come closer!
He's a hostage!

162
00:14:58,379 --> 00:15:03,363
If you wanna save your friend's life,
give me some water and food!

163
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:06,361
I'm hungry and it's driving me mad!

164
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:07,665
Move quickly or...

165
00:15:08,047 --> 00:15:10,029
...I'll just park my blade right here!

166
00:15:13,998 --> 00:15:17,934
There's no point in taking Luffy hostage...

167
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:24,676
Why are you guys ignoring me?!

168
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,997
I said water and food!

169
00:15:27,866 --> 00:15:29,863
If you're hungry, do you wanna eat this?

170
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:31,841
I'm not gonna eat such a salty thing!

171
00:15:32,379 --> 00:15:35,394
You guys are just a goofy,
weak group of pirates!

172
00:15:35,772 --> 00:15:39,059
Elizabeth and I can easily destroy you!

173
00:15:41,326 --> 00:15:43,298
She says "No sweat" as well.

174
00:15:44,034 --> 00:15:45,027
What?

175
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:47,419
Do you understand what Elizabeth is saying?

176
00:15:47,468 --> 00:15:48,489
Yeah.

177
00:15:48,927 --> 00:15:52,495
Oh, wow! I mean you're...

178
00:15:52,787 --> 00:15:55,797
...so fluffy and cute!

179
00:15:56,421 --> 00:16:00,476
Your compliment doesn't make
me happy at all, you fool!

180
00:16:00,672 --> 00:16:02,664
You're so cute!

181
00:16:05,406 --> 00:16:07,421
She's wide open.

182
00:16:08,424 --> 00:16:11,418
Luffy-san has been freed as well.

183
00:16:14,037 --> 00:16:18,609
You're so horrible. You almost got me.

184
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:22,673
You were trying to lower my guard
with your cuteness, weren't you?

185
00:16:24,226 --> 00:16:25,732
That was close.

186
00:16:26,293 --> 00:16:27,300
What?!

187
00:16:27,887 --> 00:16:32,860
That brat... How has she
survived being that stupid?

188
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:39,787
Give me water and food... now!

189
00:16:40,809 --> 00:16:41,831
Are you okay?!

190
00:16:47,347 --> 00:16:48,328
Eat it.

191
00:16:49,483 --> 00:16:51,967
You put poison or something in there,
didn't you?!

192
00:16:52,482 --> 00:16:54,163
I'm a cook.

193
00:16:54,215 --> 00:16:57,196
I wouldn't do anything to waste food.

194
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,749
Now, you can't eat holding that, can you?

195
00:17:12,057 --> 00:17:15,967
Don't rush. I'll make
you as much as you want.

196
00:17:21,401 --> 00:17:24,445
She says "Thank you for feeding Olga."

197
00:17:25,228 --> 00:17:29,239
Olga, after you eat,
you need to tell us why you did this.

198
00:17:30,732 --> 00:17:32,869
Oh... That pattern...

199
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:35,790
Is that the script of Alchemi?

200
00:17:37,019 --> 00:17:38,478
Alchemi?

201
00:17:38,523 --> 00:17:41,369
Damn! I can't believe someone noticed.

202
00:17:41,431 --> 00:17:42,445
What's that?

203
00:17:44,013 --> 00:17:49,943
Alchemi is a legendary island
that suddenly disappeared 200 years ago.

204
00:17:58,042 --> 00:17:59,245
Did you have enough?

205
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:03,600
I've never had anything
this delicious before!

206
00:18:04,013 --> 00:18:07,012
Hey! Tell us about Alchemi.

207
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:12,515
In Alchemi, there was a person
named Myskina Acier...

208
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:16,574
...who was doing research
on how to refine metal, I heard.

209
00:18:23,584 --> 00:18:28,570
He created a metal called Pure Gold.

210
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,940
Pure Gold?

211
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:33,450
It's a legendary metal.

212
00:18:33,798 --> 00:18:36,588
They say it even shines in darkness

213
00:18:36,621 --> 00:18:40,623
and it's worth a fortune,
enough to even buy the whole world.

214
00:18:41,425 --> 00:18:46,419
People have been looking for the Pure Gold
since the earliest times.

215
00:18:47,295 --> 00:18:52,311
However, those who obtain it ruin themselves.

216
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:58,991
This Pure Gold thing is unbelievable.

217
00:18:59,135 --> 00:19:01,125
A legendary metal, huh?!

218
00:19:01,251 --> 00:19:05,242
"It's worth a fortune,
enough to even buy the whole world"?!

219
00:19:05,313 --> 00:19:07,328
I want it!

220
00:19:07,572 --> 00:19:10,561
Do you have anything to do with Alchemi?

221
00:19:11,356 --> 00:19:15,359
Do you know where the treasure is?
Tell us!

222
00:19:15,945 --> 00:19:17,351
I won't tell you!

223
00:19:18,691 --> 00:19:21,690
You're a horrible liar.

224
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:26,421
Saying "I won't tell you" is almost like
admitting that you know where it is.

225
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:30,932
Where is Alchemi?!

226
00:19:30,993 --> 00:19:36,032
Even if I tell you,
it's impossible for you weak pirates to get it.

227
00:19:37,553 --> 00:19:40,409
You're not gonna believe where it's located.

228
00:19:40,443 --> 00:19:43,399
It sounds interesting!

229
00:19:45,632 --> 00:19:48,547
We'll take you to Alchemi.

230
00:19:48,611 --> 00:19:51,898
Dangerous people are everywhere
in the New World.

231
00:19:52,286 --> 00:19:56,326
We can protect you if we're with you.

232
00:19:57,848 --> 00:20:00,395
I don't need any help from others!

233
00:20:00,426 --> 00:20:02,453
I've been living by myself for so long!

234
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:07,334
I only interact with other people
to take advantage of them.

235
00:20:17,354 --> 00:20:21,745
You're just a kid
but you've been through a lot!

236
00:20:21,813 --> 00:20:24,433
Your pity won't make my stomach full.

237
00:20:25,726 --> 00:20:28,198
What the... When did you change?

238
00:20:28,231 --> 00:20:29,683
Oh, this?!

239
00:20:30,249 --> 00:20:34,236
We need to be prepared if we're
gonna hunt for the treasure!

240
00:20:44,954 --> 00:20:47,965
All right! Let's go treasure hunting!

241
00:20:48,203 --> 00:20:53,216
What? I haven't said I'm coming with you yet.

242
00:20:53,397 --> 00:20:55,790
The Straw Hat Treasure Gang!

243
00:20:55,849 --> 00:20:57,219
Go!

244
00:20:57,555 --> 00:20:59,578
Listen to me!

245
00:20:59,673 --> 00:21:02,923
You can't stop them
once they get into that zone.

246
00:21:03,372 --> 00:21:04,366
Olga.

247
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,603
We need to talk.

248
00:21:07,476 --> 00:21:08,782
About what?

249
00:21:08,843 --> 00:21:10,626
We have nine people on our side

250
00:21:10,676 --> 00:21:13,001
but we can do with 6:4 for
the ratio of the share.

251
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:15,105
Of course, you take "6"!

252
00:21:15,789 --> 00:21:21,992
Weak pirates like you guys can't get
to the Pure Gold anyway.

253
00:21:22,022 --> 00:21:25,195
We guarantee you we will. Look!

254
00:21:25,731 --> 00:21:29,685
We have this many champs
worth over 100 million.

255
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:32,195
We'll also offer you the
service of taking you

256
00:21:32,241 --> 00:21:35,267
to any island you like after
exchanging the treasure for money.

257
00:21:35,378 --> 00:21:38,394
I give you such a special offer
because of our friendship.

258
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,120
Isn't it a good deal?

259
00:21:40,393 --> 00:21:42,361
Humph! Honestly!

260
00:21:43,002 --> 00:21:46,011
Okay, so these people are strong.

261
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:51,109
That means I can use these Straw Hat idiots
as much as I like...

262
00:21:51,703 --> 00:21:56,269
...to get the Pure Gold and
betray them at the end.

263
00:21:56,309 --> 00:22:00,304
I can have it all to myself that way!

264
00:22:02,401 --> 00:22:04,424
I heard everything you said.

265
00:22:06,442 --> 00:22:08,415
So that's how it is and...

266
00:22:08,432 --> 00:22:12,410
...Olga has agreed to guide us to Alchemi!

267
00:22:12,426 --> 00:22:16,449
But she's gonna betray us
at the end so be careful!

268
00:22:18,335 --> 00:22:21,150
And how are you gonna guide us?

269
00:22:21,396 --> 00:22:24,397
Do you have an Eternal Pose or something?

270
00:22:24,855 --> 00:22:26,795
I have this.

271
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:30,823
This will lead us to Alchemi.

272
00:22:31,506 --> 00:22:37,525
The thing is there is a piece
of Pure Gold inside this ring.

273
00:22:37,645 --> 00:22:40,367
What?! Pure Gold?!

274
00:22:40,436 --> 00:22:42,227
Let me see!

275
00:22:42,282 --> 00:22:47,282
No! If I let it shine in a place like this,
it's gonna be a problem!

276
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:52,862
Hey, you damn Moss Head!

277
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:56,096
I know. You don't have to call
me every time, Dirty Cook!

278
00:22:56,168 --> 00:22:59,170
What's this?
I feel something is here!

279
00:23:01,876 --> 00:23:03,835
What?! What's going on?!

280
00:23:04,104 --> 00:23:05,432
There must be enemies.

281
00:23:16,307 --> 00:23:20,002
Tsk! I don't like stubborn guys.

282
00:23:24,606 --> 00:23:26,543
It's...

283
00:23:32,488 --> 00:23:34,497
...Mad Treasure!

284
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:36,720
Do you know him?

285
00:23:36,811 --> 00:23:41,806
He's a treasure hunter who'd
do anything to get treasure.

286
00:23:42,364 --> 00:23:44,362
He's the worst.

287
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,916
I can't believe you detected the camouflage.

288
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:53,100
Seems like even Psycho P's
ability isn't good enough

289
00:23:53,133 --> 00:23:56,063
for the Haki of the Color of Observation!

290
00:23:56,938 --> 00:24:01,880
The ability of camouflage?!

291
00:24:01,929 --> 00:24:03,928
What's wrong? Are you okay?

292
00:24:05,262 --> 00:24:07,336
It's nothing, Robin-chan.

293
00:24:07,768 --> 00:24:11,724
Hey, you Dirty Water Imp!
Do you know that guy too?

294
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:15,223
No... I wish I had known...

295
00:24:21,572 --> 00:24:24,354
Are you guys going for the Pure Gold too?

296
00:24:24,368 --> 00:24:29,369
Yeah! We're gonna go on
a treasure hunt with her!

297
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:38,082
I let her go so that she
could guide us to Alchemi.

298
00:24:38,561 --> 00:24:47,491
I'm not happy with some pirates
stealing the lead to the Pure Gold!

299
00:24:50,801 --> 00:24:52,805
Crap! It's started!

300
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,573
--Let's go!
--Yeah!

301
00:24:54,783 --> 00:24:57,385
Oh, now that I get a good look at them

302
00:24:57,468 --> 00:25:00,674
and it's clear that they're the Straw Hats

303
00:25:00,705 --> 00:25:02,931
who are drawing so much
attention in the New World.

304
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:05,619
This is gonna be fun.

305
00:25:21,426 --> 00:25:22,595
Exploding Star!

306
00:25:32,335 --> 00:25:34,316
Dos Fleurs!

307
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:37,837
Clutch!

308
00:25:48,603 --> 00:25:52,552
You guys really are strong!

309
00:25:53,038 --> 00:25:56,494
I'll protect you even if it kills me!

310
00:25:57,557 --> 00:26:01,497
Oh, I'm already dead!

311
00:26:03,326 --> 00:26:07,326
Luffy is the guy who took down
the ill-famed Doflamingo!

312
00:26:08,038 --> 00:26:11,050
What? What's a Doflamingo?

313
00:26:11,456 --> 00:26:14,478
Olga, you really don't know anything...

314
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,361
Well, just watch.

315
00:26:16,403 --> 00:26:20,351
You'll see that it's a pretty safe
bet to go on an adventure with us.

316
00:26:20,757 --> 00:26:22,761
Gum-Gum...

317
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:25,926
...Gatling!

318
00:26:36,013 --> 00:26:38,007
This is great.

319
00:26:38,386 --> 00:26:41,341
The stronger the enemy

320
00:26:41,513 --> 00:26:46,504
who you fight over treasure,
the more exciting treasure hunting gets!

321
00:26:49,199 --> 00:26:50,267
Young lady.

322
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:53,054
Cheating is bad.

323
00:26:53,918 --> 00:26:57,860
I'll go along with your
treasure hunt to the end!

324
00:26:58,394 --> 00:27:00,402
No, I don't want you!

325
00:27:00,834 --> 00:27:04,676
I don't like classless guys like you!

326
00:27:04,745 --> 00:27:07,754
Olga has already become our ally!

327
00:27:09,253 --> 00:27:12,211
I'm the one who decides that!

328
00:27:20,065 --> 00:27:21,063
Straw Hat!

329
00:27:21,394 --> 00:27:25,428
I'll take the lead for the Pure Gold!

330
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:29,821
That's not up to you to decide!
You bastard!

331
00:27:31,133 --> 00:27:33,692
No, fools!
She'll die if you keep pulling!

332
00:27:40,605 --> 00:27:43,551
Something's gonna come out of me!

333
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:56,675
I knew she had it!

334
00:27:57,074 --> 00:27:58,064
Is that...

335
00:27:58,534 --> 00:28:00,523
...the Pure Gold?!

336
00:28:11,092 --> 00:28:14,119
The treasure that can even
buy the whole world, is...

337
00:28:14,676 --> 00:28:16,797
The treasure sank into the sea!

338
00:28:17,041 --> 00:28:19,196
So why don't you guys go away already?!

339
00:28:27,387 --> 00:28:29,344
Olga, are you okay?

340
00:28:29,727 --> 00:28:32,650
I almost threw up.

341
00:28:42,728 --> 00:28:43,746
Oh no!

342
00:28:44,296 --> 00:28:46,319
Bonbori-sama's gonna come!

343
00:28:46,837 --> 00:28:48,910
Bonbori-sama...?

344
00:29:08,532 --> 00:29:09,526
What's that?

345
00:29:25,434 --> 00:29:27,594
--Isn't that too big?!
--Yes!

346
00:29:27,994 --> 00:29:30,227
That's a giant footballfish.

347
00:29:31,971 --> 00:29:33,990
Bonbori-sama.

348
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:47,909
H-Hey! This is bad news, isn't it?!

349
00:29:52,685 --> 00:29:55,627
My boss, let's pull out!

350
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:03,523
Franky, make an emergency escape
with Coup de Burst!

351
00:30:03,922 --> 00:30:04,915
Okay!

352
00:30:08,512 --> 00:30:13,557
Guys! Hang onto something!
The Emergency Escape System!

353
00:30:18,369 --> 00:30:20,095
Coup de...!

354
00:30:22,025 --> 00:30:23,743
You shouldn't run!

355
00:30:24,056 --> 00:30:26,095
What are you talking about?!

356
00:30:26,869 --> 00:30:31,036
Do you really wanna look for the Pure Gold?

357
00:30:31,143 --> 00:30:34,051
Yeah because it sounds interesting.

358
00:30:34,302 --> 00:30:36,489
Then, let me tell you something.

359
00:30:37,071 --> 00:30:39,518
The phantom island, Alchemi, is...

360
00:30:39,845 --> 00:30:42,698
...located inside Bonbori-sama's stomach!

361
00:30:46,996 --> 00:30:50,115
I thought the Pure Gold sank
into the sea earlier...

362
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:53,130
That was just a tiny piece of it!

363
00:30:53,224 --> 00:30:57,505
A really jumbo piece of
Pure Gold is in there!

364
00:30:58,213 --> 00:31:02,220
A really jumbo piece of Pure Gold?!

365
00:31:02,677 --> 00:31:05,190
Franky! Bring us about 180 degrees!

366
00:31:05,211 --> 00:31:06,002
Okay!

367
00:31:06,049 --> 00:31:07,541
Wait a sec!

368
00:31:07,807 --> 00:31:12,706
If you want a really jumbo piece of Pure Gold,
head into the mouth!

369
00:31:12,742 --> 00:31:14,011
--Okay!
--No, you idiot!

370
00:31:14,085 --> 00:31:17,073
Don't do it!
We're gonna die if we get chewed up!

371
00:31:19,158 --> 00:31:20,210
My boss!

372
00:31:20,468 --> 00:31:22,489
We're gonna sail in there too!

373
00:31:26,243 --> 00:31:27,605
It looks interesting!

374
00:31:28,036 --> 00:31:30,049
Well, we have no choice but to go.

375
00:31:32,667 --> 00:31:34,669
This is an adventure!

376
00:31:34,829 --> 00:31:36,076
Oh no!

377
00:31:38,074 --> 00:31:39,373
The Pure Gold!

378
00:31:45,743 --> 00:31:48,568
We've been completely devoured!

379
00:31:48,658 --> 00:31:54,068
If nothing is done, we'll be digested
and be nothing but bones.

380
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:58,182
Oh! I'm already nothing but bones!

381
00:32:00,441 --> 00:32:02,503
They followed us!

382
00:32:02,576 --> 00:32:05,570
They came into the mouth?!
They must be out of their minds!

383
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,898
So are you all!

384
00:32:07,734 --> 00:32:09,640
Here they come!

385
00:32:20,443 --> 00:32:23,433
Avoid the uvula!

386
00:32:24,121 --> 00:32:26,108
Uvula?

387
00:32:26,809 --> 00:32:28,737
That's big.

388
00:32:34,557 --> 00:32:38,614
He wants to make us crash into the uvula!

389
00:32:39,206 --> 00:32:42,064
I know! But...!

390
00:32:42,154 --> 00:32:45,146
The uvula is huge!

391
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:55,513
Gum-Gum...

392
00:32:55,601 --> 00:32:57,620
...Balloon!

393
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:04,228
Nice, Luffy!

394
00:33:04,368 --> 00:33:06,215
Luffy-san, grab my hand!

395
00:33:06,251 --> 00:33:07,233
Yeah!

396
00:33:12,601 --> 00:33:14,549
--Luffy!
--Luffy-san!

397
00:33:16,128 --> 00:33:20,110
Those who get in our way
are destined for hell!

398
00:33:21,537 --> 00:33:24,480
Oh no! Luffy's gonna die!

399
00:33:24,668 --> 00:33:26,362
What? Why?

400
00:33:26,431 --> 00:33:31,284
Devil Fruit eaters can't swim
because the sea hates them.

401
00:33:31,368 --> 00:33:34,407
They can't even use their abilities
so they'll just drown.

402
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:40,057
In that case, it's not a bad idea
to have them owe me a favor or two.

403
00:33:40,094 --> 00:33:41,112
Elizabeth!

404
00:33:44,314 --> 00:33:46,345
I'll save Luffy!

405
00:33:46,853 --> 00:33:48,854
Whoa-whoa, will she be okay?

406
00:33:48,922 --> 00:33:50,925
Tsk! What a pain!

407
00:33:51,292 --> 00:33:53,639
--Sanji-kun!
--Yes, Nami-san!

408
00:33:53,814 --> 00:33:57,092
Leave Luffy with Olga and you stay here!

409
00:33:57,397 --> 00:33:59,404
Luffy's in trouble but...

410
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:02,709
...seems like we're also in trouble.

411
00:34:03,156 --> 00:34:05,990
We passed through the uvula
but now, are we gonna

412
00:34:06,024 --> 00:34:08,427
fall through the throat,
straight down to the stomach?!

413
00:34:08,591 --> 00:34:11,591
And we'll be broken down to pulp
by gastric juices.

414
00:34:11,676 --> 00:34:13,662
Quit the scary thoughts!

415
00:34:14,746 --> 00:34:19,727
Guys! Don't get thrown off!

416
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:28,964
Now...

417
00:34:29,053 --> 00:34:30,761
How is it gonna be?

418
00:34:32,479 --> 00:34:38,500
It's one of the most exciting
treasure hunts ever!

419
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:45,459
I'm losing strength...

420
00:34:46,977 --> 00:34:49,995
Luffy! I'm coming to save you!

421
00:35:14,743 --> 00:35:16,712
Where am I?

422
00:35:19,373 --> 00:35:21,408
Anyway, I gotta find everyone else.

423
00:35:23,766 --> 00:35:25,699
Ouch!

424
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,189
Be careful.

425
00:35:30,493 --> 00:35:33,768
If you soak in Bonbori-sama's
gastric juice, you'll be dissolved.

426
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:35,795
Oh, you're alive!

427
00:35:35,857 --> 00:35:37,856
Cut the crap!

428
00:35:38,046 --> 00:35:43,015
If I didn't save you,
you would've been in trouble!

429
00:35:43,542 --> 00:35:47,175
Drowned! Sunk! Dissolved!

430
00:35:47,198 --> 00:35:49,259
And you would've been dead by now.

431
00:35:49,649 --> 00:35:52,823
You should be thanking me,
and have a sense of obligation!

432
00:35:52,968 --> 00:35:55,112
Alright. Thanks!

433
00:35:55,999 --> 00:35:58,029
Thank you too, Elizabeth!

434
00:36:00,795 --> 00:36:03,021
If you thank me without protesting like that,

435
00:36:03,053 --> 00:36:07,031
it makes me feel like I'm an evil-minded jerk
who expects something in return.

436
00:36:07,423 --> 00:36:08,422
Olga!

437
00:36:09,037 --> 00:36:12,069
--Are we in the stomach?
--That's right.

438
00:36:12,655 --> 00:36:17,583
There's even an island! It's so vast!

439
00:36:17,929 --> 00:36:20,918
It must be one of the islands
Bonbori-sama swallowed.

440
00:36:21,247 --> 00:36:25,257
Bonbori-sama has three
giant stomachs like this.

441
00:36:26,432 --> 00:36:29,393
We're in the first stomach now.

442
00:36:29,842 --> 00:36:33,327
If you go through the second stomach
and get to the third stomach,

443
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:38,089
you'll find the island of Alchemi
where the Pure Gold is.

444
00:36:44,982 --> 00:36:47,986
We're in the stomach
but it's nice and bright here.

445
00:36:48,246 --> 00:36:50,266
Yeah, thanks to Bonbori-sama's lamp.

446
00:36:51,491 --> 00:36:54,076
Since its light is so strong,

447
00:36:54,143 --> 00:36:59,125
it goes through its body
and even reaches inside the stomach.

448
00:36:59,171 --> 00:37:02,005
So it's bright in here all the time.

449
00:37:02,083 --> 00:37:04,544
You know quite a lot about it.

450
00:37:07,652 --> 00:37:11,642
Oh no. If nothing is done, we'll be eaten.

451
00:37:14,062 --> 00:37:17,085
Gum-Gum Pistol!

452
00:37:28,139 --> 00:37:30,167
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

453
00:37:30,516 --> 00:37:31,583
Well done, Straw Hat!

454
00:37:32,404 --> 00:37:35,402
Finally, I get to... I get to...

455
00:37:35,687 --> 00:37:38,637
Do you have something against them?

456
00:37:38,973 --> 00:37:43,900
Finally, I get to... eat it!

457
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:47,591
Oh, I'm full!

458
00:37:47,962 --> 00:37:51,204
My dream of 200 years finally came true.

459
00:37:51,413 --> 00:37:53,158
200 years?!

460
00:37:53,242 --> 00:37:57,728
For 200 years, I've only
been living on fish that

461
00:37:57,835 --> 00:38:00,111
washed ashore and fruits on the island.

462
00:38:00,554 --> 00:38:04,561
So it's been my dream
to eat as much meat as I want.

463
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:11,654
"For 200 years" means
you're like a very old grandma!

464
00:38:12,084 --> 00:38:17,396
That's so rude!
If I'm a grandma, you're a grandpa!

465
00:38:17,759 --> 00:38:20,791
You look a lot older than me.

466
00:38:21,534 --> 00:38:24,490
I've only been alive for 19 years.

467
00:38:25,026 --> 00:38:28,353
You're so much younger than me.

468
00:38:28,502 --> 00:38:31,204
You've been living for 200
years but you don't look old.

469
00:38:31,289 --> 00:38:34,037
That's amazing! Are you sure?

470
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,091
I am.

471
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:42,457
I was swallowed
by Bonbori-sama 200 years ago.

472
00:38:44,981 --> 00:38:46,419
200 years ago,

473
00:38:46,703 --> 00:38:52,699
I was living on the island of steel, Alchemi,
with my parents.

474
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:58,284
But since my crappy old man

475
00:38:58,557 --> 00:39:00,738
who was a crappy scientist
created the Pure Gold,

476
00:39:00,819 --> 00:39:02,858
everything went wrong.

477
00:39:05,598 --> 00:39:09,136
Pirates who heard about the Pure Gold came

478
00:39:09,267 --> 00:39:12,270
and killed my mother.

479
00:39:14,557 --> 00:39:16,525
It's your fault, Dad!

480
00:39:16,632 --> 00:39:20,693
If you didn't create the Pure Gold,
this never would have happened!

481
00:39:22,136 --> 00:39:25,128
I'm gonna throw out this piece of junk!

482
00:39:36,912 --> 00:39:40,931
And I was swallowed
along with the island, Alchemi.

483
00:39:41,375 --> 00:39:43,317
What happened to your dad?

484
00:39:43,375 --> 00:39:46,285
I guess he died when we were swallowed.

485
00:39:46,393 --> 00:39:48,364
That served him right.

486
00:39:48,752 --> 00:39:50,914
I'm the only survivor...

487
00:39:51,428 --> 00:39:57,405
And for 200 years thereafter,
I've been living in this stomach all by myself.

488
00:39:57,961 --> 00:39:59,026
I see.

489
00:39:59,572 --> 00:40:01,567
You've been through a lot.

490
00:40:02,776 --> 00:40:05,810
It wasn't so bad!
It's actually quite nice to live here.

491
00:40:06,492 --> 00:40:11,148
But I managed to get out of
here by accident a while ago.

492
00:40:11,256 --> 00:40:13,804
And when I was playing around outside,

493
00:40:13,917 --> 00:40:16,617
I got caught by a group of freaks.

494
00:40:19,572 --> 00:40:22,789
Then do you know how to get out of here?

495
00:40:22,917 --> 00:40:24,195
I do.

496
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:28,179
If you wanna get out of here with
your friends and the Pure Gold,

497
00:40:28,303 --> 00:40:30,484
you have to listen to me!

498
00:40:30,629 --> 00:40:31,641
Okay!

499
00:40:33,345 --> 00:40:34,664
I'm counting on you!

500
00:40:39,918 --> 00:40:42,301
Well, leave it to me.

501
00:40:53,094 --> 00:40:57,062
Olga, I was worried that you might've died!

502
00:40:57,748 --> 00:41:02,183
Now, I want you to guide us to the Pure Gold!

503
00:41:04,077 --> 00:41:07,242
It's been decided
that she'll go on an adventure with me.

504
00:41:07,524 --> 00:41:10,465
I'm sorry but why don't you ask someone else?

505
00:41:12,045 --> 00:41:14,957
All right but...

506
00:41:15,978 --> 00:41:21,148
...the best part of treasure hunting is
robbing someone of theirs!

507
00:41:25,868 --> 00:41:27,893
Gatling!

508
00:41:47,139 --> 00:41:48,726
Gum-Gum...

509
00:41:48,771 --> 00:41:50,817
...Jet Stamp!

510
00:42:00,397 --> 00:42:04,117
That's what I expected of a man
with a bounty of 500 million.

511
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:08,773
You're a wonderful opponent
who makes my treasure hunt

512
00:42:08,834 --> 00:42:10,854
so much more exciting.

513
00:42:11,368 --> 00:42:13,089
But...

514
00:42:13,209 --> 00:42:14,906
...you can't go any farther!

515
00:42:24,259 --> 00:42:26,261
I'm sorry, Luffy!

516
00:42:26,398 --> 00:42:31,345
We were captured when we fell
into water and became helpless.

517
00:42:32,313 --> 00:42:33,353
Luffy...

518
00:42:34,679 --> 00:42:36,627
Don't move!

519
00:42:43,718 --> 00:42:44,761
Stop!

520
00:42:49,719 --> 00:42:52,970
If they're so important to you,
don't move an inch!

521
00:42:55,778 --> 00:42:57,784
Chain Lock!

522
00:43:00,571 --> 00:43:01,974
--Luffy!
--Luffy-san!

523
00:43:02,061 --> 00:43:05,038
You're not playing fair!

524
00:43:05,371 --> 00:43:07,357
Don't get me wrong!

525
00:43:07,471 --> 00:43:11,444
I'm not here for a head-on confrontation!

526
00:43:11,914 --> 00:43:14,924
I'm here for treasure hunting!

527
00:43:15,569 --> 00:43:20,532
I'll do whatever it takes
to get the treasure!

528
00:43:20,608 --> 00:43:25,538
Now, Olga! Straw Hat drops out here!

529
00:43:25,592 --> 00:43:28,791
Show me the way to the Pure Gold!

530
00:43:28,894 --> 00:43:34,084
Otherwise, I'm gonna kill
everybody including you!

531
00:43:36,241 --> 00:43:37,697
On one condition.

532
00:43:38,375 --> 00:43:42,385
I want you to share
the Pure Gold half-and-half with me!

533
00:43:43,031 --> 00:43:46,330
Half-and-half?! You're quite greedy!

534
00:43:46,826 --> 00:43:51,076
I know how to get out of Bonbori-sama.

535
00:43:51,555 --> 00:43:55,646
So even if we get the Pure Gold,
we still have to follow

536
00:43:55,701 --> 00:43:59,005
your lead until we get out of here.

537
00:43:59,821 --> 00:44:02,209
All right! I promise!

538
00:44:05,273 --> 00:44:09,044
Olga! He'll kill you after you get out!

539
00:44:09,129 --> 00:44:11,103
Just leave us and run!

540
00:44:11,252 --> 00:44:13,009
It's your fault because

541
00:44:13,088 --> 00:44:16,091
you can't go on an adventure
to the Pure Gold with me!

542
00:44:18,904 --> 00:44:23,851
I hope your ship won't be dissolved
in the sea of gastric juice!

543
00:44:26,034 --> 00:44:30,314
The Shark Emeralda is hardened
by steel and jewels.

544
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:33,349
So it's extremely sturdy!

545
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:37,209
And I have a favor to ask.

546
00:44:38,106 --> 00:44:42,111
I don't want you to kill Straw Hat here.

547
00:44:42,567 --> 00:44:45,959
You got along quite well with him.

548
00:44:46,057 --> 00:44:48,075
It's nothing like that.

549
00:44:49,346 --> 00:44:51,907
I'm just a kid so...

550
00:44:51,995 --> 00:44:55,999
...I won't be able to sleep at night
out of fear if I see a dead body.

551
00:44:56,155 --> 00:44:57,182
Olga...

552
00:44:57,903 --> 00:45:03,947
That's really cute!
Even if it's a lie, I'll go along with it!

553
00:45:04,282 --> 00:45:10,253
I have to make sure to keep you happy
until we get the Pure Gold!

554
00:45:12,604 --> 00:45:16,837
The tide of gastric juice will
begin to come in to this beach soon.

555
00:45:16,987 --> 00:45:20,529
So suffer and die a slow death.

556
00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:23,439
Straw Hat!

557
00:45:23,596 --> 00:45:27,209
You'll be dissolved here!

558
00:45:27,435 --> 00:45:29,591
--Luffy!
--Damn!

559
00:45:29,706 --> 00:45:31,056
Luffy!

560
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:34,070
Damn!

561
00:46:17,432 --> 00:46:18,654
What?!

562
00:46:29,302 --> 00:46:30,509
It's late!

563
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:35,581
I can't believe
it's running this late for feeding time!

564
00:46:36,282 --> 00:46:39,297
I'm gonna be too hungry!

565
00:46:39,707 --> 00:46:44,806
Hey! Let me out! You jerk!

566
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:56,296
Alright! Gum-Gum...

567
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:58,494
...Stamp!

568
00:47:00,677 --> 00:47:03,102
I was almost fed to them.

569
00:47:03,541 --> 00:47:06,514
Oh, they look delicious.

570
00:47:10,254 --> 00:47:12,231
I can't catch them like this.

571
00:47:12,365 --> 00:47:16,932
I didn't expect to meet a human
in Bonbori-sama's stomach!

572
00:47:17,014 --> 00:47:18,004
You!

573
00:47:19,128 --> 00:47:20,151
Ouch!

574
00:47:20,209 --> 00:47:22,381
What are you...?! Some kind of monster?!

575
00:47:22,523 --> 00:47:24,450
How rude!

576
00:47:24,549 --> 00:47:28,494
If you look carefully,
you can tell I'm a human right away!

577
00:47:29,983 --> 00:47:32,947
I don't have to look
carefully to tell you're...

578
00:47:33,166 --> 00:47:35,612
...a human, aren't you?

579
00:47:36,511 --> 00:47:39,120
You don't look like a human, either.

580
00:47:41,504 --> 00:47:44,261
This chain goes on top like this and...

581
00:47:44,473 --> 00:47:47,089
It's quite complicated.

582
00:47:49,606 --> 00:47:51,609
Okay, you're free!

583
00:47:52,854 --> 00:47:54,878
Oh, thank you, old man!

584
00:47:55,312 --> 00:47:57,902
No, I thank you.

585
00:47:58,277 --> 00:48:02,276
It's really been a while since
I talked with another human.

586
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,656
You were swallowed
by Bonbori-sama too, weren't you?!

587
00:48:05,978 --> 00:48:09,203
Yeah, it was 200 years ago.

588
00:48:09,383 --> 00:48:13,375
I got swallowed along with
the island I was living on.

589
00:48:13,589 --> 00:48:17,252
I somehow survived without being
dissolved by the gastric juice but...

590
00:48:19,399 --> 00:48:22,439
...there are so many dinosaurs here
for some reason.

591
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:25,013
I couldn't escape, either.

592
00:48:25,173 --> 00:48:28,361
So I survived pretending
that I'm one of them.

593
00:48:29,998 --> 00:48:33,032
It was like - meat, meat, meat

594
00:48:33,438 --> 00:48:35,977
and I couldn't have enough vegetables.

595
00:48:36,019 --> 00:48:40,183
How picky can you get?!
What's wrong with meat?!

596
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:42,199
There was somebody here who's been eating

597
00:48:42,238 --> 00:48:44,505
only vegetables and fruits for 200 years!

598
00:48:44,910 --> 00:48:47,347
Is there somebody else in here
other than me and you?!

599
00:48:47,730 --> 00:48:51,707
Yeah, there's a funny girl named Olga!

600
00:48:52,651 --> 00:48:53,645
Olga?!

601
00:48:56,636 --> 00:48:59,588
Olga is my daughter.

602
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:04,005
I can't believe she's alive.

603
00:49:05,393 --> 00:49:07,799
I couldn't be happier.

604
00:49:11,182 --> 00:49:12,026
Oh yeah!

605
00:49:12,047 --> 00:49:14,005
Where is she now?!

606
00:49:14,552 --> 00:49:17,519
She's been captured
by a guy named Mad Treasure.

607
00:49:17,689 --> 00:49:20,378
I'm gonna go save Olga and my friends!

608
00:49:20,413 --> 00:49:22,034
Goodbye, old man!

609
00:49:22,070 --> 00:49:24,080
Thank you for unchaining me!

610
00:49:24,911 --> 00:49:26,346
Take me with you!

611
00:49:27,194 --> 00:49:29,210
I have to save my daughter!

612
00:49:30,187 --> 00:49:31,217
All right.

613
00:49:31,824 --> 00:49:33,763
Let's go together!

614
00:49:33,963 --> 00:49:35,221
I'm Luffy!

615
00:49:39,731 --> 00:49:41,699
We gotta build a ship!

616
00:49:41,859 --> 00:49:44,393
A ship that won't be dissolved
in the sea of gastric juice!

617
00:49:45,432 --> 00:49:48,428
Could you wait here for a while?
I'll go look for materials.

618
00:49:59,235 --> 00:50:01,686
Shouldn't we just ride on this?

619
00:50:02,799 --> 00:50:05,366
Well, Water Lizards sure have an

620
00:50:05,394 --> 00:50:07,473
ability to go across the
sea of gastric juice but...

621
00:50:07,536 --> 00:50:10,096
Please! Let us ride on you!

622
00:50:10,135 --> 00:50:13,125
Alright, let me ask him.

623
00:50:19,829 --> 00:50:21,566
I see.

624
00:50:21,605 --> 00:50:24,886
If you can make him laugh
in a staring contest,

625
00:50:24,930 --> 00:50:26,932
he'll become friends with you, he said.

626
00:50:26,971 --> 00:50:30,175
That's amazing!
Do you understand what he says?

627
00:50:30,448 --> 00:50:34,144
Yeah, I've been pretending to
be a dinosaur for two centuries.

628
00:50:34,202 --> 00:50:36,142
Okay, got it!

629
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:39,113
Gum-Gum...

630
00:50:46,943 --> 00:50:49,230
Damn! He's strong!

631
00:50:49,452 --> 00:50:53,723
Luffy-kun, trying to make
your opponent laugh by force

632
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:55,285
is what second-raters do.

633
00:50:56,058 --> 00:50:59,095
The important thing in comedy is... contrast!

634
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:02,485
Like the gap between my beautiful smug face

635
00:51:02,533 --> 00:51:04,884
and over-the-top funny face!

636
00:51:05,925 --> 00:51:10,941
This equation for comedy is
perfect and excellent!

637
00:51:12,575 --> 00:51:14,928
First, my beautiful face...

638
00:51:15,045 --> 00:51:16,047
Smug face!

639
00:51:23,112 --> 00:51:25,166
You're funny!

640
00:51:26,931 --> 00:51:27,956
What's wrong?

641
00:51:28,655 --> 00:51:32,091
Nothing. It worked out so that's all right.

642
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:36,221
I'm counting on you, Chavez!

643
00:51:59,205 --> 00:52:01,741
This is too much for my bones...

644
00:52:01,871 --> 00:52:04,326
I wonder if Luffy's okay.

645
00:52:04,436 --> 00:52:08,061
Yeah, I'm worried
about Zoro, Sanji, and Franky too.

646
00:52:08,081 --> 00:52:12,636
You two are lucky.
All you gotta do is beat the drum.

647
00:52:12,657 --> 00:52:15,152
Won't the Sunny be dissolved
by Bonbori-sama's

648
00:52:15,311 --> 00:52:17,738
gastric water and disappear?

649
00:52:18,824 --> 00:52:22,183
--Don't say such an ominous thing.
--Oh, I'm sorry.

650
00:52:23,273 --> 00:52:27,234
Don't worry. Whatever happens,
they're not gonna die.

651
00:52:27,298 --> 00:52:29,307
It's gonna be alright!

652
00:52:29,514 --> 00:52:30,521
You're right.

653
00:52:34,989 --> 00:52:36,029
You slaves!

654
00:52:37,228 --> 00:52:41,218
Stop talking and keep rowing.

655
00:52:42,952 --> 00:52:44,946
Mad Treasure.

656
00:52:45,794 --> 00:52:46,800
Oh, you're...

657
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:50,268
...the Cat Burglar from back then.

658
00:52:50,996 --> 00:52:53,976
Do you want me to torment you again?

659
00:52:54,191 --> 00:52:56,227
I have friends this time!

660
00:52:56,438 --> 00:52:58,530
I'm not gonna be defeated by a guy like you!

661
00:52:59,203 --> 00:53:00,452
You have friends?

662
00:53:01,041 --> 00:53:06,070
It doesn't matter.
You shouldn't trust your friends anyway.

663
00:53:10,703 --> 00:53:14,346
Nami, did you have something to do with him?

664
00:53:14,968 --> 00:53:17,252
Yes, a little bit, a long time ago.

665
00:53:18,354 --> 00:53:21,651
I once stole his treasure.

666
00:53:24,234 --> 00:53:27,250
When I got to his safe,

667
00:53:28,148 --> 00:53:32,144
somebody else was already there, stealing.

668
00:53:33,537 --> 00:53:36,497
She was one of my chief competitors.

669
00:53:38,849 --> 00:53:40,910
We slipped up

670
00:53:42,070 --> 00:53:45,109
and both of us got caught by Mad Treasure.

671
00:53:47,157 --> 00:53:48,176
Then...

672
00:53:48,862 --> 00:53:51,372
...she just used me as a decoy
and never came back.

673
00:53:54,652 --> 00:53:59,181
Because of her, I was almost killed.

674
00:53:59,233 --> 00:54:05,218
So I was right. I shouldn't trust others.
I should just take advantage of them.

675
00:54:05,281 --> 00:54:06,973
That's not true.

676
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:11,241
Friends aren't the people you betray.
They're the people you trust.

677
00:54:12,087 --> 00:54:15,305
I'm sure Luffy and the
others will come save us.

678
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:23,805
It's the second stomach from here.

679
00:54:25,808 --> 00:54:28,806
The color of the water looks dangerous!

680
00:54:32,353 --> 00:54:33,618
What's wrong, Chavez?

681
00:54:33,953 --> 00:54:36,290
Oh no! His legs are starting to be dissolved!

682
00:54:36,624 --> 00:54:38,782
Let's let him rest on an island!

683
00:54:41,532 --> 00:54:43,491
The Sunny!

684
00:54:47,855 --> 00:54:50,327
Sunny! I'm glad to see you!

685
00:54:50,619 --> 00:54:52,881
Is that your ship?

686
00:54:52,944 --> 00:54:55,545
Yes, it's the Thousand Sunny!

687
00:55:01,101 --> 00:55:02,316
Who are you boys?

688
00:55:02,398 --> 00:55:05,664
Oh! Zoro! Sanji! Franky!

689
00:55:08,794 --> 00:55:11,430
Aren't they your friends?!

690
00:55:11,494 --> 00:55:14,495
I kill you.

691
00:55:17,066 --> 00:55:19,081
I'll dish you up!

692
00:55:19,113 --> 00:55:22,097
I'll take your life!

693
00:55:23,291 --> 00:55:25,310
There must be something wrong with you guys.

694
00:55:30,437 --> 00:55:31,456
Chest!

695
00:55:31,769 --> 00:55:33,426
Gum-Gum...

696
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:35,618
...Pistol!

697
00:55:41,214 --> 00:55:45,225
What happened to you guys?!
Why are there so many of you?!

698
00:55:45,470 --> 00:55:48,470
Luffy-kun, don't you think they're fake?

699
00:55:48,588 --> 00:55:49,590
Are they?!

700
00:55:49,812 --> 00:55:51,806
My throw ups

701
00:55:51,837 --> 00:55:55,416
You noticed they were fake!
I pay you a lot of respect!

702
00:55:56,114 --> 00:56:00,557
But I need you to finish
yourselves off right here!

703
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:04,216
Copy Paint!

704
00:56:08,915 --> 00:56:10,864
Wow! There are a bunch of Zoros!

705
00:56:12,219 --> 00:56:14,171
But their bodies haven't changed...

706
00:56:14,216 --> 00:56:17,201
I'm not scared of the funny Zoros!

707
00:56:21,395 --> 00:56:23,388
Next is this!

708
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:29,342
Which one is the real old man?!

709
00:56:37,533 --> 00:56:40,560
Damn! It's annoying
so I'll just beat the crap out of you all!

710
00:56:40,607 --> 00:56:44,638
Don't! If you hit me,
I'm pretty sure that I'm gonna die!

711
00:56:44,784 --> 00:56:47,824
--He's right! He's right!
--This is really annoying!

712
00:56:48,573 --> 00:56:51,565
Oh yeah! Old man,
make the face you made earlier.

713
00:56:51,934 --> 00:56:53,332
You mean the smug face?

714
00:56:53,512 --> 00:56:54,510
All right...

715
00:56:55,337 --> 00:56:56,326
Look!

716
00:56:57,462 --> 00:56:59,485
This will prove that I'm the real one!

717
00:56:59,807 --> 00:57:00,814
Smug face!

718
00:57:05,172 --> 00:57:07,730
You really are funny!

719
00:57:08,277 --> 00:57:11,291
Gum-Gum Gatling!

720
00:57:15,338 --> 00:57:17,359
He's extremely strong.

721
00:57:17,454 --> 00:57:20,446
Old man, that face is really hilarious!

722
00:57:22,633 --> 00:57:25,479
I'm kind of hurt but it worked
out so that's all right.

723
00:57:25,601 --> 00:57:27,577
Camoufla-paint!

724
00:57:28,357 --> 00:57:31,389
Paying respect to your strong power

725
00:57:31,568 --> 00:57:36,571
I spare your life for now
and I'm fading out...

726
00:57:37,343 --> 00:57:38,981
What's with that guy?

727
00:57:39,016 --> 00:57:40,457
Old man, we gotta go too!

728
00:57:43,677 --> 00:57:46,051
Finally, it's the third stomach!

729
00:57:49,964 --> 00:57:52,739
That's the island where I was born

730
00:57:52,815 --> 00:57:55,828
and where the Pure Gold is hidden, Alchemi!

731
00:58:01,042 --> 00:58:06,099
The Pure Gold is in a laboratory
deep in this abandoned mine.

732
00:58:13,747 --> 00:58:16,069
There's some writing.

733
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:20,982
Nico Robin, you're an
archaeologist, aren't you?

734
00:58:22,298 --> 00:58:24,259
Read it for us!

735
00:58:25,569 --> 00:58:27,530
All right.

736
00:58:28,417 --> 00:58:32,921
"Those who invade this land
seeking glimmering gold..."

737
00:58:33,446 --> 00:58:35,812
"...must pay the price with death."

738
00:58:35,870 --> 00:58:38,335
Death... With death?!

739
00:58:38,522 --> 00:58:42,171
"My name is Myskina Acier."

740
00:58:42,562 --> 00:58:43,572
Acier?!

741
00:58:43,932 --> 00:58:45,187
Do you know who that is?

742
00:58:45,436 --> 00:58:47,116
Yes, I know him too well.

743
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:51,189
He's my crappy old man
who created the Pure Gold!

744
00:58:53,913 --> 00:58:54,932
What the...?!

745
00:58:58,222 --> 00:59:00,224
B-Boss...

746
00:59:00,608 --> 00:59:02,749
We're all dead.

747
00:59:05,115 --> 00:59:06,882
He's dead!

748
00:59:06,942 --> 00:59:10,943
Those who went first must've
been caught in a trap.

749
00:59:11,058 --> 00:59:15,074
I'm starting to smell the
sweet scent of danger!

750
00:59:15,771 --> 00:59:18,621
I-I'm already dead.

751
00:59:18,733 --> 00:59:23,769
So if it's just some simple traps,
I-I'm not gonna die because I'm dead.

752
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:31,251
Looks like there's a trap in this room.

753
00:59:33,603 --> 00:59:35,564
Peacock Organ...

754
00:59:36,108 --> 00:59:38,343
"Only those who can play the right notes"

755
00:59:38,912 --> 00:59:43,911
"and those who have a pure mind
can approach the bright gold."

756
00:59:44,936 --> 00:59:46,937
What does that mean?

757
00:59:47,156 --> 00:59:48,149
I think...

758
00:59:48,565 --> 00:59:51,245
...if you can play the organ exactly

759
00:59:51,268 --> 00:59:53,284
as it's written in the
score there, you survive.

760
00:59:53,565 --> 00:59:57,034
But if you fail,
a rain of arrows comes down.

761
00:59:57,093 --> 00:59:58,253
Really?!

762
00:59:58,342 --> 01:00:01,357
You can count on me for
playing an instrument.

763
01:00:01,981 --> 01:00:03,975
I'm a musician.

764
01:00:07,206 --> 01:00:09,800
That's perfect!

765
01:00:09,871 --> 01:00:13,882
But don't even make a single mistake!

766
01:00:14,239 --> 01:00:17,233
It'll mean death...

767
01:00:17,295 --> 01:00:19,311
...for you and...

768
01:00:20,804 --> 01:00:22,867
...your friends!

769
01:00:23,312 --> 01:00:26,081
I'm aware of that, of course!

770
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:29,831
I'll even risk my life for my friends!

771
01:00:30,148 --> 01:00:33,127
Although I already don't have life!

772
01:00:37,118 --> 01:00:39,120
We're counting on you, Brook!

773
01:00:40,757 --> 01:00:43,730
This is a beautiful lullaby.

774
01:00:52,856 --> 01:00:53,897
This song is....

775
01:00:56,085 --> 01:01:01,761
A gentle smile and a dignified smile

776
01:01:01,794 --> 01:01:06,742
Your adorable smile

777
01:01:07,479 --> 01:01:12,517
Silver hearts and gold hearts

778
01:01:13,593 --> 01:01:18,591
I'll give them all to you

779
01:01:24,188 --> 01:01:26,948
--What's the matter?!
--He stopped playing!

780
01:01:28,726 --> 01:01:31,151
I may not look it but I'm a musician!

781
01:01:31,721 --> 01:01:34,909
Even if the score isn't perfect,
I'll try to see what the writer wanted,

782
01:01:35,183 --> 01:01:37,722
and play it right!

783
01:01:38,087 --> 01:01:40,125
This is how the next part should be!

784
01:01:51,577 --> 01:01:53,502
What is it?

785
01:01:56,270 --> 01:01:58,245
Cien Fleurs!

786
01:02:02,005 --> 01:02:03,268
Robin-san!

787
01:02:03,906 --> 01:02:05,565
Continue playing, okay?

788
01:02:05,807 --> 01:02:07,628
Yes! This time...

789
01:02:19,562 --> 01:02:22,472
All right!
Play the right notes this time!

790
01:02:22,656 --> 01:02:24,933
We'll take care of the arrows!

791
01:02:24,953 --> 01:02:26,954
Okay! I'll leave them in your hands!

792
01:02:36,667 --> 01:02:38,269
Mil Fleurs!

793
01:02:38,317 --> 01:02:40,261
Gigantesco Mano!

794
01:02:41,011 --> 01:02:43,039
Chopper and Robin's Vortex!

795
01:02:47,468 --> 01:02:51,400
I can't believe it! He's...

796
01:02:52,129 --> 01:02:56,076
He's trusting his friends and
not running from such a terrible situation!

797
01:02:58,403 --> 01:03:00,271
I can't figure out the next part!

798
01:03:01,354 --> 01:03:04,060
I'm still pretty unskilled.

799
01:03:04,179 --> 01:03:09,165
I'm not really getting what the writer
wanted to express with this song!

800
01:03:09,238 --> 01:03:14,203
If it keeps on like this,
Robin-san and Chopper-san would get hurt!

801
01:03:14,589 --> 01:03:18,569
I want... I want some kind of a clue!

802
01:03:20,847 --> 01:03:23,828
Follow my singing!

803
01:03:24,362 --> 01:03:27,351
Olga! It's dangerous there! Come back!

804
01:03:29,414 --> 01:03:35,132
A gentle smile and a dignified smile

805
01:03:35,246 --> 01:03:40,238
Your adorable smile

806
01:03:41,010 --> 01:03:46,833
Silver hearts and gold hearts

807
01:03:46,909 --> 01:03:51,873
I'll give them all to you

808
01:03:55,613 --> 01:04:00,982
Alchemi, Alchema

809
01:04:01,413 --> 01:04:07,091
Hold the gold star

810
01:04:07,173 --> 01:04:12,943
Alchemi, Alchema

811
01:04:13,021 --> 01:04:24,043
Go into a dream

812
01:04:27,611 --> 01:04:28,597
How's that?

813
01:04:43,322 --> 01:04:46,980
Seems like you played it right.

814
01:04:47,460 --> 01:04:50,449
The door to the next room has opened.

815
01:04:53,020 --> 01:04:55,018
Don't drop dead just yet.

816
01:04:55,642 --> 01:04:59,586
I'd be in trouble
if my handy "tools" get broken.

817
01:04:59,769 --> 01:05:02,472
Olga-san, thanks to you,

818
01:05:02,694 --> 01:05:05,720
I felt what the writer was feeling
and it touched me to the bones!

819
01:05:06,675 --> 01:05:10,735
The song is filled with a parent's love
for his or her child.

820
01:05:11,430 --> 01:05:14,271
How could you sing it?

821
01:05:14,317 --> 01:05:20,990
That's because my mom used to
sing it for me when I was little.

822
01:05:21,252 --> 01:05:23,529
You were loved so much!

823
01:05:23,627 --> 01:05:25,588
That's not true!

824
01:05:27,823 --> 01:05:30,833
But that crappy old man...

825
01:05:30,895 --> 01:05:33,623
why did he bother using my favorite song?

826
01:05:34,009 --> 01:05:35,973
My boss! We have a problem!

827
01:05:37,628 --> 01:05:38,982
What's wrong?

828
01:05:39,188 --> 01:05:43,198
You killed all of Straw
Hat's friends, didn't you?

829
01:05:43,386 --> 01:05:45,955
Straw Hat Luffy is alive!

830
01:05:47,315 --> 01:05:50,073
He's so tenacious!

831
01:05:50,170 --> 01:05:52,252
You guys, stand guard at the entrance.

832
01:05:52,507 --> 01:05:53,799
Don't let anybody in!

833
01:05:54,466 --> 01:05:57,713
--Luffy's okay as we thought!
--Yeah!

834
01:05:57,835 --> 01:06:00,821
It's gonna be okay
if we can hold up until he comes!

835
01:06:01,625 --> 01:06:03,729
Old man, how much longer will it take?

836
01:06:04,204 --> 01:06:06,051
Okay, it's done.

837
01:06:06,153 --> 01:06:08,182
According to my calculation,
Chavez's legs will be

838
01:06:08,205 --> 01:06:10,201
okay like this till we get to Alchemi.

839
01:06:12,161 --> 01:06:14,576
Hey, do you need help?

840
01:06:15,801 --> 01:06:17,813
Cut the crap!

841
01:06:18,031 --> 01:06:21,066
You actually can't carry
it any longer, can you?

842
01:06:22,902 --> 01:06:26,240
Who do you think you're talking to,
you spiral-eyebrowed Dirty Water Imp?!

843
01:06:27,084 --> 01:06:29,191
Oh? Aren't they your friends?

844
01:06:29,285 --> 01:06:32,495
Maybe they're fake again!
I gotta hit them to see if they're real!

845
01:06:32,543 --> 01:06:34,190
Gum-Gum...

846
01:06:34,270 --> 01:06:36,206
...Pistol!

847
01:06:36,954 --> 01:06:38,818
--Gum-Gum?
--Is that Luffy?

848
01:06:38,861 --> 01:06:40,857
You posers!

849
01:06:41,341 --> 01:06:43,795
Hey, Luffy! It's me! Me!

850
01:06:43,877 --> 01:06:45,123
Are you the real one?!

851
01:06:45,350 --> 01:06:49,285
No, you could be just a strong poser!

852
01:06:49,495 --> 01:06:52,488
No-Sword Style Dragon Twister!

853
01:06:53,519 --> 01:06:56,517
Here's the proof that I'm the real one!

854
01:06:59,228 --> 01:07:01,089
They're the real Zoro and Sanji!

855
01:07:01,124 --> 01:07:04,077
--We are!
--Don't give us trouble!

856
01:07:07,150 --> 01:07:09,044
Old man, they're my friends!

857
01:07:09,148 --> 01:07:13,658
So they're as strong as Luffy-kun.
I feel like I'm in good hands.

858
01:07:13,704 --> 01:07:14,717
Right?

859
01:07:16,045 --> 01:07:19,099
Yo, Luffy! You're okay as I thought!

860
01:07:20,557 --> 01:07:22,507
Franky!

861
01:07:23,845 --> 01:07:25,855
Where are the others?

862
01:07:26,062 --> 01:07:28,339
Are they having lunch or something somewhere?

863
01:07:29,310 --> 01:07:31,035
Nami and the others are...

864
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:35,130
They're all being held by the chain guy
and were taken somewhere!

865
01:07:35,146 --> 01:07:37,153
--What?!
--Seriously?!

866
01:07:37,237 --> 01:07:38,941
I grasp the situation!

867
01:07:38,974 --> 01:07:42,277
I'll alter the Sunny to be
able to cross the sea of acid!

868
01:07:42,527 --> 01:07:45,862
But it'll take a while to beef
up the Sunny to prevent it

869
01:07:45,902 --> 01:07:47,902
from being dissolved.

870
01:07:47,934 --> 01:07:49,923
So give me some time.

871
01:07:50,068 --> 01:07:52,032
No, I can't wait!

872
01:07:53,850 --> 01:07:55,362
When I think of the things that

873
01:07:55,402 --> 01:07:59,419
they could be doing to
Nami-san and Robin-chan at this moment,

874
01:07:59,778 --> 01:08:02,769
I feel like I'm going insane with rage!

875
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:04,208
Does he fly?!

876
01:08:04,968 --> 01:08:07,005
Sky Walk!

877
01:08:09,138 --> 01:08:13,081
Nami-san, Robin-chan! I'm on my way!

878
01:08:14,806 --> 01:08:16,396
We're gonna go now too!

879
01:08:16,478 --> 01:08:20,056
I'll catch up with you later
after I beef up the Sunny!

880
01:08:20,248 --> 01:08:24,277
--I'll leave it to you!
--So, where is the chain guy now?

881
01:08:24,394 --> 01:08:27,382
He's probably at Alchemi
where the Pure Gold is!

882
01:08:27,460 --> 01:08:28,688
Okay, let's go!

883
01:08:29,054 --> 01:08:31,032
Old man, guide us!

884
01:08:40,179 --> 01:08:42,149
"The Eagle Bridge."

885
01:08:42,257 --> 01:08:44,759
"Those worthy of the bright gold..."

886
01:08:44,803 --> 01:08:49,776
"...must have both excellent power
of concentration and bold courage."

887
01:08:50,846 --> 01:08:55,185
"Hit the saintly eagle and build the bridge."

888
01:08:55,652 --> 01:08:59,636
Will the bridge come down
if we hit the target?

889
01:09:00,137 --> 01:09:04,137
The road cuts off here
so we have no choice, I guess.

890
01:09:04,573 --> 01:09:06,587
It's your turn.

891
01:09:15,923 --> 01:09:17,644
Arm Boost!

892
01:09:17,673 --> 01:09:20,628
Cloven Rose!

893
01:09:21,917 --> 01:09:22,938
Usopp!

894
01:09:23,295 --> 01:09:28,237
Hey, I'm gonna shoot at
the target so unchain me!

895
01:09:29,347 --> 01:09:32,381
If you get scared and come back,
I'll kill the hostage.

896
01:09:32,444 --> 01:09:36,008
It'll be a pain if he brings
that dinosaur with him.

897
01:09:36,059 --> 01:09:37,672
I know!

898
01:09:39,189 --> 01:09:41,540
Usopp! Now's your chance!

899
01:09:43,741 --> 01:09:47,196
It's not too far.
And there's no wind in the stomach.

900
01:09:47,511 --> 01:09:50,243
I'll hit right in the middle!

901
01:09:50,322 --> 01:09:53,304
Green Star - Skull Bombgrass!

902
01:09:59,660 --> 01:10:00,667
What's the matter?!

903
01:10:00,893 --> 01:10:04,837
There's a rapidly rising current
from the gastric juice below!

904
01:10:04,969 --> 01:10:07,759
It gusts up randomly with varying strength.

905
01:10:07,798 --> 01:10:10,462
I can't measure the trajectory like this!

906
01:10:13,462 --> 01:10:15,414
What's that?!

907
01:10:16,473 --> 01:10:19,476
Usopp! Watch out! It's coming at you!

908
01:10:27,251 --> 01:10:29,254
Special Attack: Exploding Star!

909
01:10:31,329 --> 01:10:33,262
No, no...

910
01:10:34,812 --> 01:10:36,863
Cloven Rose!

911
01:10:37,478 --> 01:10:42,427
I'll stall this one so hurry
up and hit the target!

912
01:10:42,962 --> 01:10:44,960
That's easy for him to say.

913
01:10:45,062 --> 01:10:47,937
There's a random updraft
blowing up from the gastric juice!

914
01:10:47,998 --> 01:10:50,015
How can I predict it?!

915
01:10:51,828 --> 01:10:56,118
Oh yeah! If I can generate a current
that counters the updraft...

916
01:10:59,907 --> 01:11:02,096
I can measure the trajectory!

917
01:11:13,623 --> 01:11:16,485
Green star - Skull Bombgrass!

918
01:11:23,085 --> 01:11:24,344
Now!

919
01:11:37,777 --> 01:11:39,048
He did it!

920
01:11:54,769 --> 01:11:58,843
Good job!
You guys are very useful "tools"!

921
01:11:59,221 --> 01:12:00,854
Are you okay?

922
01:12:01,032 --> 01:12:04,979
Whoa-whoa, it's too early to be broken down.

923
01:12:05,016 --> 01:12:08,980
I need you to work for me a little bit more.

924
01:12:17,774 --> 01:12:19,835
So this is Alchemi.

925
01:12:20,853 --> 01:12:23,873
Being dissolved by the gastric
juice, it changed a lot

926
01:12:23,983 --> 01:12:26,080
but I'm sure the mineshaft hasn't changed.

927
01:12:26,206 --> 01:12:28,231
The Pure Gold is in there...

928
01:12:28,684 --> 01:12:31,127
So are the kidnapped
Nami-san and the others...

929
01:12:31,212 --> 01:12:32,202
Let's go!

930
01:12:38,644 --> 01:12:41,885
This is where you guys are gonna die!
The end!

931
01:12:44,954 --> 01:12:45,948
It's an ambush!

932
01:12:51,205 --> 01:12:53,163
Shoot!

933
01:12:55,501 --> 01:12:58,584
Luffy, go ahead! We'll keep them busy!

934
01:12:59,771 --> 01:13:02,773
Gum-Gum Pistol!

935
01:13:05,948 --> 01:13:07,951
Old man, lead the way!

936
01:13:20,856 --> 01:13:21,908
What's that?

937
01:13:34,235 --> 01:13:35,508
"The Final Gate."

938
01:13:35,838 --> 01:13:39,872
"Those worthy of the bright gold are
trusted by others."

939
01:13:40,588 --> 01:13:43,661
"Unlock the key along with
your courageous friends."

940
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:46,875
"The treasure lies ahead."

941
01:13:47,821 --> 01:13:49,039
This is the last one.

942
01:13:49,621 --> 01:13:51,577
What should we do?

943
01:13:51,995 --> 01:13:55,051
Seems like we need to unlock
the door deep in the

944
01:13:55,223 --> 01:13:57,187
alligator's mouth with that key.

945
01:13:57,242 --> 01:14:00,226
But there must be some kind of trap.

946
01:14:00,775 --> 01:14:05,764
Guys, it's your last job. I need you to go.

947
01:14:27,605 --> 01:14:29,906
I knew this'd happen!

948
01:14:30,012 --> 01:14:31,963
Me too!

949
01:14:34,870 --> 01:14:37,219
Nami, hurry up and unlock it!

950
01:14:37,313 --> 01:14:38,300
Okay!

951
01:14:39,514 --> 01:14:41,575
I don't have time to think this over.

952
01:14:49,546 --> 01:14:50,593
What's the matter?!

953
01:14:50,961 --> 01:14:53,954
If it's incorrect, the trap will get you!

954
01:14:58,863 --> 01:15:00,900
Feels like it got heavier!

955
01:15:01,392 --> 01:15:03,366
Hurry up, Nami!

956
01:15:03,885 --> 01:15:05,919
Nami-san!

957
01:15:08,477 --> 01:15:10,873
There are 17 keyholes left.

958
01:15:10,988 --> 01:15:12,686
If I don't pick the right one...

959
01:15:23,614 --> 01:15:27,543
Every time we miss, it gets heavier...

960
01:15:30,225 --> 01:15:33,164
I'm gonna break!

961
01:15:33,591 --> 01:15:35,350
This is exciting!

962
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:37,787
That's a cool trap!

963
01:15:37,887 --> 01:15:39,838
1 out of 15!

964
01:15:40,544 --> 01:15:41,858
1 out of 10!

965
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,014
1 out of 5!

966
01:15:56,848 --> 01:15:58,123
Leave it to me!

967
01:16:01,543 --> 01:16:04,512
There are two holes that
we haven't tried yet.

968
01:16:04,682 --> 01:16:06,379
This is our last chance!

969
01:16:07,993 --> 01:16:08,991
Left?!

970
01:16:10,156 --> 01:16:11,277
Right?!

971
01:16:14,258 --> 01:16:17,197
No, I'll take the one on the left!

972
01:16:27,420 --> 01:16:30,339
We can't hold out any longer!

973
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:33,209
Are you okay, guys?!

974
01:16:38,810 --> 01:16:39,799
Luffy!

975
01:16:39,946 --> 01:16:41,706
Gum-Gum...

976
01:16:41,838 --> 01:16:44,859
...Jet Pistol!

977
01:16:48,092 --> 01:16:51,331
Boy! After all our pains and troubles...

978
01:16:51,437 --> 01:16:54,652
He's done a reckless thing as usual!

979
01:16:58,509 --> 01:17:00,097
You jerk!

980
01:17:00,191 --> 01:17:03,151
What did you do to my friends?!

981
01:17:03,737 --> 01:17:07,339
I just used them as tools.

982
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:32,425
Olga!

983
01:17:50,274 --> 01:17:51,527
Are you...

984
01:17:52,126 --> 01:17:54,091
...my old man?

985
01:18:00,024 --> 01:18:02,417
Olga, you need to get away

986
01:18:02,507 --> 01:18:06,198
from here with Luffy-kun and the others.

987
01:18:20,227 --> 01:18:21,659
What's this place?

988
01:18:21,962 --> 01:18:23,991
Where does it lead to?

989
01:18:24,258 --> 01:18:28,278
I don't think we can climb back up
so we should just go forward.

990
01:18:31,754 --> 01:18:32,773
This is...!

991
01:18:40,819 --> 01:18:42,144
The Pure Gold!

992
01:18:45,941 --> 01:18:48,206
So this is the treasure!

993
01:18:49,513 --> 01:18:52,323
I can buy the whole world with this!

994
01:18:52,383 --> 01:18:56,509
Why is such a valuable thing here?
What is this place?

995
01:18:56,609 --> 01:18:59,181
It's my crappy old man's lab.

996
01:18:59,599 --> 01:19:03,353
But I can't believe he's alive...

997
01:19:03,791 --> 01:19:08,204
He said he was having a hard time
after being caught by a dinosaur.

998
01:19:08,530 --> 01:19:11,071
Does that mean he was
in Bonbori-sama's stomach?

999
01:19:11,107 --> 01:19:14,181
Yeah. He cried when I
told him you were alive.

1000
01:19:14,245 --> 01:19:15,226
What?

1001
01:19:19,448 --> 01:19:20,450
This is...

1002
01:19:20,641 --> 01:19:21,652
What is it?

1003
01:19:21,903 --> 01:19:24,157
It's Acier-san's research journal.

1004
01:19:25,170 --> 01:19:29,642
"I decided to make the forbidden Pure Gold."

1005
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:33,040
"I know that it's wrong as a scientist."

1006
01:19:33,556 --> 01:19:36,986
"But in order to save my daughter
from a fatal disease,"

1007
01:19:37,317 --> 01:19:40,306
"I'd even sell my soul to the devil."

1008
01:19:40,702 --> 01:19:41,939
A fatal disease?

1009
01:19:42,768 --> 01:19:47,259
"I found out the light of the
Pure Gold has the effect of..."

1010
01:19:47,388 --> 01:19:51,392
"...suppressing the growth of living things
to an extreme extent."

1011
01:19:52,267 --> 01:19:56,047
"I should be able to stop the
progression of my daughter's disease

1012
01:19:56,106 --> 01:19:58,130
by letting her absorb the light."

1013
01:20:00,378 --> 01:20:04,338
Don't ever take this ring off, okay?

1014
01:20:05,386 --> 01:20:08,831
So he put the piece of the
Pure Gold in that ring

1015
01:20:08,979 --> 01:20:12,458
to stop the progression of your disease.

1016
01:20:12,592 --> 01:20:13,618
No...

1017
01:20:13,721 --> 01:20:17,364
That's why you haven't changed for 200 years.

1018
01:20:17,399 --> 01:20:20,402
What?! Are you 200 years old?!

1019
01:20:20,887 --> 01:20:22,034
A grandma?

1020
01:20:26,081 --> 01:20:28,085
When my mother died,

1021
01:20:28,413 --> 01:20:32,421
my crappy old man was suffering too, I guess.

1022
01:20:34,629 --> 01:20:36,629
Despite that, I...

1023
01:20:37,627 --> 01:20:41,541
Even though he made the Pure Gold
to save me...

1024
01:20:42,914 --> 01:20:45,026
I'm a big fool!

1025
01:20:45,981 --> 01:20:48,950
For 200 years, I've been holding a grudge

1026
01:20:49,090 --> 01:20:52,102
against my father who saved my life!

1027
01:21:00,652 --> 01:21:04,938
You're Myskina Acier, aren't you?
How dare you do that!

1028
01:21:06,270 --> 01:21:10,791
I couldn't help my daughter
in any way for two centuries.

1029
01:21:10,877 --> 01:21:13,875
I finally got my chance to protect her.

1030
01:21:14,761 --> 01:21:18,789
Even if I'm a worthless man,
I'm glad that I'm alive.

1031
01:21:19,897 --> 01:21:21,581
I thought something like this

1032
01:21:21,598 --> 01:21:26,346
might happen so I set explosives
to protect my research!

1033
01:21:27,056 --> 01:21:28,078
Olga.

1034
01:21:28,977 --> 01:21:30,013
I love you.

1035
01:21:37,296 --> 01:21:39,290
Everybody, run!

1036
01:21:39,419 --> 01:21:43,404
My crappy old man must've pushed
the self-destruct button!

1037
01:21:44,849 --> 01:21:46,761
I'll protect Olga!

1038
01:21:48,128 --> 01:21:50,118
You bastard!

1039
01:21:58,295 --> 01:21:59,699
Gum-Gum...

1040
01:21:59,726 --> 01:22:01,168
...Balloon!

1041
01:22:07,090 --> 01:22:08,141
Ow, ow, ow...

1042
01:22:09,492 --> 01:22:10,477
The Pure Gold?!

1043
01:22:10,626 --> 01:22:12,308
There it is!

1044
01:22:25,057 --> 01:22:32,050
Is this the treasure you tried to protect
at the cost of your own life?!

1045
01:22:32,202 --> 01:22:33,212
Old man!

1046
01:22:35,027 --> 01:22:40,722
The Pure Gold can extend a human life!

1047
01:22:40,856 --> 01:22:46,261
It's the treasure that the damn
Celestial Dragons drool over!

1048
01:22:46,327 --> 01:22:52,550
Now I, Mad Treasure, got it!

1049
01:23:04,383 --> 01:23:06,996
I'm sorry, Luffy-kun.

1050
01:23:07,057 --> 01:23:12,049
By my calculation, I was gonna be
buried under the rocks along with him!

1051
01:23:13,562 --> 01:23:15,910
You can't just die by your own choosing!

1052
01:23:16,284 --> 01:23:20,236
I've been holding a grudge
against you for 200 years!

1053
01:23:20,779 --> 01:23:25,788
So I'll be in trouble if you don't make it
until I get my revenge on you!

1054
01:23:27,114 --> 01:23:32,080
You created the Pure Gold
in order to extend my life, didn't you?

1055
01:23:32,832 --> 01:23:37,178
I didn't know that
because you didn't make it clear to me!

1056
01:23:39,665 --> 01:23:41,616
Crappy old man...

1057
01:23:42,998 --> 01:23:44,036
Dad!

1058
01:23:46,354 --> 01:23:47,370
Olga.

1059
01:23:48,687 --> 01:23:50,085
I'm sorry.

1060
01:23:59,929 --> 01:24:02,935
What's so funny?

1061
01:24:04,047 --> 01:24:05,083
What did you say?

1062
01:24:05,827 --> 01:24:09,006
There's no point in getting a treasure...

1063
01:24:09,819 --> 01:24:12,100
...if you cast off your friends!

1064
01:24:12,946 --> 01:24:16,967
Why are you getting mad, Straw Hat?

1065
01:24:17,240 --> 01:24:18,952
You can get as many friends

1066
01:24:19,024 --> 01:24:22,514
as you want with money and
power, don't you think?

1067
01:24:24,629 --> 01:24:26,656
You can just dominate your friends

1068
01:24:26,836 --> 01:24:29,847
by taking advantage of their greed and fear.

1069
01:24:30,931 --> 01:24:34,957
Your friends are very handy.

1070
01:24:36,113 --> 01:24:38,897
After I kill you,

1071
01:24:39,431 --> 01:24:44,350
I'm gonna reuse them!

1072
01:24:48,550 --> 01:24:49,532
This is...

1073
01:24:50,346 --> 01:24:52,858
--What the...
--What's going on?!

1074
01:24:52,925 --> 01:24:56,933
Bonbori-sama is reacting
to the light of the Pure Gold!

1075
01:25:08,519 --> 01:25:13,517
I'll use the power of the Pure Gold

1076
01:25:14,102 --> 01:25:19,109
and hunt treasures forever!

1077
01:25:19,143 --> 01:25:21,113
How boring!

1078
01:25:21,211 --> 01:25:24,100
Your treasure hunting is...

1079
01:25:24,207 --> 01:25:26,213
...so boring!

1080
01:25:38,143 --> 01:25:39,154
Luffy!

1081
01:25:43,204 --> 01:25:45,850
You can't have my friends!

1082
01:25:45,885 --> 01:25:50,280
Quit it with that dull crap!

1083
01:25:51,924 --> 01:25:53,964
Three-Sword Style...

1084
01:25:54,033 --> 01:25:55,984
...Dragon Twister!

1085
01:26:01,533 --> 01:26:03,481
Hey, what's up?!

1086
01:26:07,682 --> 01:26:10,672
Mad Chain!

1087
01:26:26,088 --> 01:26:28,086
Second Gear!

1088
01:26:44,357 --> 01:26:48,524
Hey! Is he gonna be okay?!

1089
01:26:48,706 --> 01:26:51,757
Luffy's not gonna be dissolved, is he?!

1090
01:27:01,644 --> 01:27:03,613
We're in danger too!

1091
01:27:05,206 --> 01:27:07,602
The gastric juice keeps swelling!

1092
01:27:07,782 --> 01:27:10,810
If nothing is done,
we'll be dissolved along with the island!

1093
01:27:21,859 --> 01:27:23,872
He's here!

1094
01:27:25,004 --> 01:27:28,036
Iron Pirate...

1095
01:27:28,247 --> 01:27:32,218
...General Franky!

1096
01:27:34,149 --> 01:27:36,149
It's a robot!

1097
01:27:41,488 --> 01:27:43,230
I'm here to save you!

1098
01:27:43,292 --> 01:27:47,298
I parked the beefed-up Sunny nearby!

1099
01:27:47,932 --> 01:27:48,945
Now,

1100
01:27:49,597 --> 01:27:50,636
come on board!

1101
01:27:56,652 --> 01:28:00,287
How can you attack me when I'm camouflaged?!

1102
01:28:00,351 --> 01:28:03,745
I've been strategizing about the
power of invisibility for a long time

1103
01:28:04,058 --> 01:28:07,077
so I totally know how those abilities work.

1104
01:28:08,610 --> 01:28:12,608
Eye, ear, nose, tongue, body.

1105
01:28:13,924 --> 01:28:14,959
Mind.

1106
01:28:16,223 --> 01:28:18,915
Those six sense organs have senses of...

1107
01:28:19,138 --> 01:28:22,196
...good, bad, and neutral!

1108
01:28:24,037 --> 01:28:26,014
Then, each of those 18
senses are classified into

1109
01:28:26,045 --> 01:28:28,006
the purified and defiled states!

1110
01:28:28,906 --> 01:28:33,230
One life, 36 desires!

1111
01:28:36,530 --> 01:28:38,953
That's enough playing,

1112
01:28:39,524 --> 01:28:41,526
drunken lady!

1113
01:28:41,910 --> 01:28:43,101
One-Sword Style...

1114
01:28:43,820 --> 01:28:46,136
...36-Pound Phoenix!

1115
01:28:49,287 --> 01:28:52,111
Sober-up Stimulus Strike!

1116
01:28:52,330 --> 01:28:54,266
No!

1117
01:28:59,950 --> 01:29:02,299
How could you be that surprised?

1118
01:29:03,067 --> 01:29:08,050
Flying slash attacks aren't so rare nowadays.

1119
01:29:10,809 --> 01:29:13,857
I'm thankful to you.

1120
01:29:14,830 --> 01:29:15,865
Thankful?

1121
01:29:18,485 --> 01:29:22,432
I couldn't eat the Clear-Clear Fruit
which allows its user to become invisible

1122
01:29:22,593 --> 01:29:25,184
so I buried one of my dreams.

1123
01:29:25,761 --> 01:29:30,051
But your ability to camouflage...

1124
01:29:31,015 --> 01:29:34,239
...opens up new possibilities for me!

1125
01:29:34,885 --> 01:29:37,161
What are you talking about?

1126
01:29:37,233 --> 01:29:39,358
A man can't help peeking in women's baths...

1127
01:29:39,691 --> 01:29:40,697
I mean,

1128
01:29:41,180 --> 01:29:43,203
we can't help having dreams!

1129
01:29:44,657 --> 01:29:47,690
Have you ever had a dream?!

1130
01:29:48,324 --> 01:29:49,733
I...

1131
01:29:49,924 --> 01:29:53,898
I don't dream!

1132
01:29:57,582 --> 01:29:58,833
Don't lie!

1133
01:29:59,644 --> 01:30:01,665
If there is any possibility,

1134
01:30:01,860 --> 01:30:05,169
people can't help trying it!

1135
01:30:07,398 --> 01:30:10,677
Blaze up! A boyhood dream!

1136
01:30:12,821 --> 01:30:15,854
Remember-My-Dream!

1137
01:30:25,773 --> 01:30:26,796
Women's baths...

1138
01:30:27,319 --> 01:30:28,636
I mean,

1139
01:30:28,707 --> 01:30:30,722
don't give up your dream!

1140
01:30:37,744 --> 01:30:38,925
Luffy!

1141
01:30:45,278 --> 01:30:47,074
It's no fun!

1142
01:30:47,163 --> 01:30:52,189
It's no fun to get a treasure
when you sacrifice your friends!

1143
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:57,436
It's meaningless to go on an adventure
without your friends!

1144
01:30:59,579 --> 01:31:01,873
Friends are perfect...

1145
01:31:02,576 --> 01:31:05,772
...when you can use and then discard them.

1146
01:31:06,250 --> 01:31:12,181
I don't care if it's fun or not!
This is the way I live!

1147
01:31:20,795 --> 01:31:22,787
Mad Chain!

1148
01:31:23,045 --> 01:31:25,011
Gigantea!

1149
01:31:35,881 --> 01:31:37,892
Straw Hat!

1150
01:31:38,079 --> 01:31:43,327
I thought you went out to sea
because you wanted to get the One Piece!

1151
01:31:43,845 --> 01:31:46,444
It doesn't matter
if you sacrifice your friends.

1152
01:31:46,588 --> 01:31:53,170
The one who gets a treasure
any way he can is the winner!

1153
01:31:54,410 --> 01:31:57,362
I'm not like you.

1154
01:31:57,934 --> 01:32:01,373
I'll never cast off my friends.

1155
01:32:02,633 --> 01:32:08,010
I'll cherish both my dream and my friends!

1156
01:32:08,334 --> 01:32:09,705
What?!

1157
01:32:09,731 --> 01:32:13,703
Isn't that too greedy?!

1158
01:32:14,612 --> 01:32:16,606
Third Gear!

1159
01:32:25,736 --> 01:32:27,772
Gum-Gum...

1160
01:32:28,025 --> 01:32:31,978
...Elephant Gun!

1161
01:33:05,413 --> 01:33:08,696
It surprisingly took a lot of trouble
to bring them down.

1162
01:33:08,815 --> 01:33:10,778
Alright, let's get out.

1163
01:33:11,887 --> 01:33:12,902
Okay!

1164
01:33:16,684 --> 01:33:18,656
My boss!

1165
01:33:19,271 --> 01:33:25,188
Your life is more important
than the treasure!

1166
01:33:28,084 --> 01:33:34,037
All treasures in the world are mine!

1167
01:33:40,266 --> 01:33:43,770
Here we go!

1168
01:33:44,132 --> 01:33:46,239
The gastric juice is backing up!

1169
01:33:46,386 --> 01:33:48,786
Isn't it a little too fast?!

1170
01:33:49,185 --> 01:33:53,166
I think Bonbori-sama's having dry heaves

1171
01:33:53,242 --> 01:33:55,728
from the impact that Luffy-kun caused!

1172
01:33:55,755 --> 01:33:57,790
So the way to get out that you

1173
01:33:57,884 --> 01:34:00,502
were talking about was to make it puke.

1174
01:34:00,554 --> 01:34:02,607
Yes, that's how I got out.

1175
01:34:03,495 --> 01:34:06,783
But you caused too much impact!

1176
01:34:17,953 --> 01:34:21,918
Oh, the uvula! I missed it so much!

1177
01:34:23,078 --> 01:34:24,626
There's the exit!

1178
01:34:24,678 --> 01:34:28,672
Make it out in one burst
so that we won't be caught up in the puke!

1179
01:34:28,779 --> 01:34:30,260
You can count on me!

1180
01:34:30,894 --> 01:34:34,882
Coup de Burst!

1181
01:35:03,642 --> 01:35:05,468
We got out successfully!

1182
01:35:05,487 --> 01:35:08,218
Yes! We did!

1183
01:35:08,301 --> 01:35:10,553
We're back alive!

1184
01:35:10,634 --> 01:35:13,662
I've always been dead though!

1185
01:35:14,710 --> 01:35:17,710
You should be happy
that your bones weren't dissolved!

1186
01:35:24,558 --> 01:35:27,567
Don't tell me that light is...

1187
01:35:29,703 --> 01:35:32,706
Yes, that's a giant Pure Gold.

1188
01:35:32,761 --> 01:35:34,765
What?!

1189
01:35:35,685 --> 01:35:39,657
Bonbori-sama really likes to eat Pure Gold.

1190
01:35:40,874 --> 01:35:43,883
And all the Pure Gold that has been digested

1191
01:35:43,906 --> 01:35:46,863
in its stomach build up in the lamp.

1192
01:35:48,603 --> 01:35:52,920
"Those who get the Pure Gold will
meet with disaster."

1193
01:35:53,609 --> 01:35:58,624
The "disaster" actually is
Bonbori-sama's appetite.

1194
01:36:00,174 --> 01:36:03,188
Bonbori-sama is swimming away.

1195
01:36:04,050 --> 01:36:09,979
It'll never appear in front
of us without the Pure Gold.

1196
01:36:10,191 --> 01:36:15,154
And I'll never create Pure Gold again.

1197
01:36:16,857 --> 01:36:20,285
We'll never see Alchemi again.

1198
01:36:48,238 --> 01:36:50,692
Luffy-kun, everybody.

1199
01:36:50,827 --> 01:36:53,582
Thank you very much for everything!

1200
01:36:53,625 --> 01:36:55,631
Thank you.

1201
01:36:56,234 --> 01:36:58,926
When we were swallowed by Bonbori-sama,

1202
01:36:59,013 --> 01:37:02,018
she lost her Pure Gold ring.

1203
01:37:02,331 --> 01:37:05,715
Will she be okay with the disease?

1204
01:37:05,787 --> 01:37:09,426
That's okay! It'd be so much better...

1205
01:37:09,630 --> 01:37:14,169
...to stay out here and die
than to go back in there!

1206
01:37:14,569 --> 01:37:15,594
Olga.

1207
01:37:16,479 --> 01:37:18,888
What's the name of the disease do you have?

1208
01:37:19,550 --> 01:37:21,755
The South Blue Emperor Fever.

1209
01:37:23,128 --> 01:37:24,615
It's incurable.

1210
01:37:24,699 --> 01:37:26,138
What?!

1211
01:37:27,185 --> 01:37:32,108
That disease has a specific cure already!

1212
01:37:32,611 --> 01:37:33,636
What?

1213
01:37:33,896 --> 01:37:36,899
It's not incurable now!

1214
01:37:37,645 --> 01:37:38,706
Are you sure?!

1215
01:37:39,354 --> 01:37:42,351
It was worth living for
200 years, wasn't it?!

1216
01:37:43,815 --> 01:37:46,508
If you get this shot, you'll be okay!

1217
01:37:48,846 --> 01:37:50,477
I...

1218
01:37:50,785 --> 01:37:53,816
I don't like those!

1219
01:37:54,208 --> 01:37:56,656
Hey! No! Stop running!

1220
01:37:56,687 --> 01:37:59,676
Hey! You're gonna die without it, you know?!

1221
01:37:59,699 --> 01:38:00,685
Hey, wait!

1222
01:38:02,063 --> 01:38:03,742
That's great.

1223
01:38:04,439 --> 01:38:08,462
Both creating the Pure Gold
and the last two centuries were...

1224
01:38:09,405 --> 01:38:11,421
...worthwhile, I guess.

1225
01:38:13,441 --> 01:38:15,190
Give me your arm!

1226
01:38:15,239 --> 01:38:19,330
I really don't like to get shots!

1227
01:38:25,259 --> 01:38:27,223
They're gone now.

1228
01:38:28,646 --> 01:38:32,647
I actually feel better without those fools!

1229
01:38:35,603 --> 01:38:38,641
Now, what are we gonna do?

1230
01:38:38,930 --> 01:38:40,973
We can do whatever we want.

1231
01:38:41,406 --> 01:38:45,779
I've done everything by myself
for two centuries.

1232
01:38:45,973 --> 01:38:47,513
It's gonna be okay.

1233
01:38:47,616 --> 01:38:52,612
I can do anything too
as long as I'm with my beloved daughter.

1234
01:38:56,582 --> 01:38:57,945
I may be your daughter

1235
01:38:58,999 --> 01:39:02,949
but I'm a 206-year-old woman!

1236
01:39:27,841 --> 01:39:31,652
In the end, we couldn't get anything.

1237
01:39:31,742 --> 01:39:33,769
No, we got something!

1238
01:39:35,059 --> 01:39:37,636
I found something good!

1239
01:39:37,764 --> 01:39:38,772
What's that?

1240
01:39:39,938 --> 01:39:42,949
It's an invitation to Grantesoro!

1241
01:39:43,338 --> 01:39:44,917
A Vivre Card is attached!

1242
01:39:45,219 --> 01:39:48,209
What's Grantesoro?!

1243
01:39:48,378 --> 01:39:52,626
It's the world's largest entertainment city!

1244
01:39:53,067 --> 01:39:55,088
There are casinos and luxurious hotels.

1245
01:39:55,260 --> 01:40:00,215
It's a dream city where celebrities
from all over the world gather!

1246
01:40:01,205 --> 01:40:02,970
Gambling, huh?

1247
01:40:03,074 --> 01:40:05,728
I bet they have good restaurants.

1248
01:40:05,843 --> 01:40:07,860
And high-end hotels.

1249
01:40:08,133 --> 01:40:11,147
I wonder if they have rock shows
or something like that.

1250
01:40:11,374 --> 01:40:13,791
Maybe, they have an amusement park!

1251
01:40:13,861 --> 01:40:15,899
We gotta go there, Luffy!

1252
01:40:18,989 --> 01:40:20,799
Sounds like fun!

1253
01:40:20,867 --> 01:40:22,851
Let's go, then!

1254
01:40:24,692 --> 01:40:28,393
Destination: Grantesoro!

1255
01:40:29,634 --> 01:40:35,707
Yes, I'll never forget at any time

1256
01:40:37,343 --> 01:40:41,384
If I get to see you again

1257
01:40:46,387 --> 01:40:52,439
I'll never lose my way and
do as my heart tells me

1258
01:40:54,143 --> 01:40:59,089
I said it to myself over and over again

1259
01:41:00,580 --> 01:41:03,565
Even if we're far apart

1260
01:41:03,598 --> 01:41:06,356
Even if we're pushed back by headwinds

1261
01:41:06,396 --> 01:41:11,824
You just keep looking
ahead without turning back

1262
01:41:11,877 --> 01:41:14,520
Those eyes that never lose their color are

1263
01:41:14,564 --> 01:41:22,573
miracle diamonds that started
sparkling in your heart

1264
01:41:22,737 --> 01:41:28,139
My excitement is going out of
control and getting entwined

1265
01:41:28,175 --> 01:41:33,692
I'll never shed tears even when I grow up

1266
01:41:33,847 --> 01:41:39,348
The future you're imagining
is just around the corner

1267
01:41:39,394 --> 01:41:46,458
Don't look back if that's our destiny

1268
01:42:05,290 --> 01:42:09,753
Mad Treasure couldn't get the Pure Gold.

1269
01:42:09,824 --> 01:42:12,879
The Pure Gold vanished into the sea.

1270
01:42:14,162 --> 01:42:16,144
Should we search for it?

1271
01:42:16,758 --> 01:42:19,741
No, leave it as it is...

1272
01:42:20,966 --> 01:42:23,974
...to maintain the balance of the world.

1273
01:42:24,395 --> 01:42:25,762
Yes, sir.

1274
01:42:25,925 --> 01:42:30,929
Anyway, was it that man
who was manipulating Mad Treasure

1275
01:42:31,234 --> 01:42:33,190
behind the scenes?

1276
01:42:33,406 --> 01:42:36,429
Yes, I think it was...

1277
01:42:36,936 --> 01:42:38,928
...Tesoro.

1278
01:42:40,946 --> 01:42:43,915
Guild Tesoro.

1279
01:42:45,863 --> 01:42:47,889
What an annoying guy.

1280
01:42:53,797 --> 01:42:57,787
Mad Treasure has been taken down by someone

1281
01:42:57,995 --> 01:43:01,977
and he couldn't get the Pure Gold, I heard.

1282
01:43:02,724 --> 01:43:04,727
I see.

1283
01:43:04,742 --> 01:43:07,763
I can't believe that formidable Mad Treasure
has been brought down.

1284
01:43:09,136 --> 01:43:11,134
I'm really surprised.

1285
01:43:11,826 --> 01:43:14,853
Now that's entertainment!

1286
01:43:16,328 --> 01:43:17,976
Who did it?

1287
01:43:18,078 --> 01:43:22,068
Oh, I'm afraid I don't know.

1288
01:43:24,746 --> 01:43:29,793
Well, forget it.
We can just hire somebody else.

1289
01:43:30,564 --> 01:43:32,979
We have so many ways to enjoy ourselves

1290
01:43:33,084 --> 01:43:36,084
with the excess amount of gold I have!
