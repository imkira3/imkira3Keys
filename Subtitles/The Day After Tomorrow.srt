2
00:03:16,581 --> 00:03:18,181
You see how it's done?

3
00:03:18,341 --> 00:03:20,901
Yeah, I think I got the hang of it.

4
00:03:21,061 --> 00:03:25,741
You better. The boss will chew my
head off if these cores get messed up.

5
00:03:25,901 --> 00:03:27,581
Don't worry.

6
00:03:41,581 --> 00:03:43,701
We're at 26 feet.

7
00:03:43,941 --> 00:03:45,661
You let Jason operate the drill?

8
00:03:45,861 --> 00:03:47,901
Yeah, he can handle it.

9
00:04:38,661 --> 00:04:40,781
I didn't do anything.

10
00:04:47,101 --> 00:04:50,341
Give me your hand!
Let go of the drill!

11
00:04:57,981 --> 00:05:00,741
Forget it, Jack! It's too late!

12
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,261
You're not gonna make it!

13
00:05:25,421 --> 00:05:26,661
Jack!

14
00:05:37,221 --> 00:05:39,941
Jack! Give me your hand!

15
00:05:44,181 --> 00:05:46,181
I've got you!

16
00:05:48,901 --> 00:05:50,341
What were you thinking?

17
00:05:52,261 --> 00:05:56,701
- What's happening?
- The whole damn shelf is breaking off!

18
00:05:56,941 --> 00:05:59,021
That's what's happening!

19
00:06:17,141 --> 00:06:20,861
We found evidence of a cataclysmic climate
shift, which occurred 10,000 years ago.

20
00:06:24,381 --> 00:06:28,261
The concentration of these natural
greenhouse gases in the ice cores...

21
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:31,781
indicates that runaway warming
pushed Earth into an "Ice Age" ...

22
00:06:31,941 --> 00:06:34,221
which lasted two centuries.

23
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:37,421
I'm confused.

24
00:06:37,581 --> 00:06:41,581
I thought you were talking about
global warming, not an "Ice Age".

25
00:06:41,781 --> 00:06:48,141
Yes, it is a paradox, but global warming can
trigger a cooling trend. Let me explain.

26
00:06:48,621 --> 00:06:53,381
The Northern Hemisphere owes its climate
to the North Atlantic Current.

27
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:57,741
Heat from the sun arrives at the equator
and is carried north by the ocean.

28
00:06:57,981 --> 00:07:03,541
But global warming is melting the polar
ice caps and disrupting this flow.

29
00:07:03,701 --> 00:07:07,261
Eventually it will shut down.
And when that occurs ...

30
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:09,341
there goes our warm climate.

31
00:07:09,501 --> 00:07:15,261
Excuse me. When do you think this
could happen, professor? When?

32
00:07:15,461 --> 00:07:19,381
I don't know. Maybe in 100 years,
maybe in 1,000. But what I do know is ...

33
00:07:19,581 --> 00:07:24,941
that if we do not act soon, our children
and grandchildren will have to pay the price.

34
00:07:26,581 --> 00:07:29,621
And who's going to pay the price
of the Kyoto Accord?

35
00:07:29,821 --> 00:07:33,661
It would cost the world's economy
hundreds of billions of dollars.

36
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:39,301
With all due respect, Mr. Vice President, the
cost of doing nothing could be even higher.

37
00:07:39,981 --> 00:07:41,781
Our climate is fragile.

38
00:07:41,981 --> 00:07:45,181
At the rate we're burning fossil fuels
and polluting the environment ...

39
00:07:45,341 --> 00:07:47,581
the ice caps will soon disappear.

40
00:07:47,741 --> 00:07:51,101
Professor Hall ...

41
00:07:51,261 --> 00:07:54,301
our economy is every bit as fragile
as the environment.

42
00:07:54,501 --> 00:07:58,501
Perhaps you should keep that in mind
before making sensationalist claims.

43
00:07:58,941 --> 00:08:02,221
Well, the last chunk of ice
that broke off ...

44
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:04,581
was about the size of Rhode Island.

45
00:08:04,741 --> 00:08:07,541
Some people might call that
pretty sensational.

46
00:08:09,861 --> 00:08:13,141
Stop global warming!
Stop global warming!

47
00:08:13,861 --> 00:08:16,501
I'm at the Global Warming Conference
in New Delhi ...

48
00:08:16,661 --> 00:08:19,141
where, if you can believe it,
it's snowing.

49
00:08:19,381 --> 00:08:22,941
The coldest weather on record
has thrown the city into chaos ...

50
00:08:23,141 --> 00:08:25,861
with numbers of homeless people
freezing to death.

51
00:08:26,061 --> 00:08:27,541
Taxi!

52
00:08:27,701 --> 00:08:31,381
I enjoyed your testimony, professor.
It was very spirited.

53
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:35,061
Oh, thank you. That's what we're
here for, right? Put on a good show?

54
00:08:35,221 --> 00:08:41,141
Quite. I was wondering if I could talk to you
about your theory on abrupt climate shift.

55
00:08:41,301 --> 00:08:43,541
The name's Rapson. Terry Rapson.

56
00:08:44,141 --> 00:08:46,821
- Professor Rapson? Of the Hedland Center?
- That's me.

57
00:08:46,981 --> 00:08:49,701
I've read your work on ocean currents.

58
00:08:49,861 --> 00:08:54,541
- What do you say to a spot of tea?
- Absolutely. If we can hail a cab.

59
00:08:57,501 --> 00:08:59,181
Over here.

60
00:09:17,861 --> 00:09:20,901
Welcome back to Glasgow, Scotland,
where "Manchester United" ...

61
00:09:21,101 --> 00:09:23,741
leads 3-1 over hometown "Celtic".

62
00:09:26,101 --> 00:09:29,781
We return 63 minutes into
the second half as "Manchester United" ...

63
00:09:29,941 --> 00:09:33,861
looks to put the game out of reach.
Let's get back to our commentator ...

64
00:09:34,021 --> 00:09:35,861
Donald MacFarland.

65
00:09:37,101 --> 00:09:39,421
What? yeah.

66
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:42,421
- I just closed my eyes for a sec, man.
- Yeah.

67
00:09:42,581 --> 00:09:44,981
The baby kept us awake all night.

68
00:09:45,181 --> 00:09:47,941
- And still.
- Yeah!

69
00:09:58,941 --> 00:10:04,821
Dennis? NOMAD buoy 4311 is showing
a temperature drop of 13 degrees.

70
00:10:05,181 --> 00:10:08,421
- Yeah? Where is 4311?
- Well, it's ...

71
00:10:12,701 --> 00:10:15,461
- Georges Bank.
- It's rough seas out there.

72
00:10:15,661 --> 00:10:17,341
Must have knocked it about.

73
00:10:29,381 --> 00:10:32,021
Kick that bloody ball. Come on!

74
00:10:32,181 --> 00:10:34,661
Come on, kick it now. Kick it!

75
00:10:35,021 --> 00:10:36,661
- Kick it!
- Are the lads winning?

76
00:10:37,941 --> 00:10:40,621
Hello, professor. How was India?

77
00:10:40,861 --> 00:10:43,381
Oh, you know what these
scientific gatherings are.

78
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:46,501
All dancing girls, wine and parties.

79
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:32,741
The fury of "Hurricane Noelani"
stunned weather experts yesterday ...

80
00:12:32,901 --> 00:12:37,901
slamming into the island chain with a
cataclysmic force never before witnessed.

81
00:12:38,141 --> 00:12:42,461
Meteorologists already believe this to be
the strongest hurricane ever recorded ...

82
00:12:43,581 --> 00:12:45,061
Are you gonna get that?

83
00:12:45,221 --> 00:12:47,381
It will surely leave a wake of death ...

84
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:52,021
- Hello?
- I just saw that Sam got an "F" in calculus.

85
00:12:52,181 --> 00:12:55,461
I'm aware, Jack.
I get a copy of his report card too.

86
00:12:55,661 --> 00:12:58,741
Sam is a straight "A" student.
He doesn't fail classes.

87
00:12:58,901 --> 00:13:00,981
I don't have time to talk about this now.

88
00:13:01,141 --> 00:13:03,981
Well, maybe you ought to make time.

89
00:13:04,181 --> 00:13:08,181
Excuse me, I'm not the one who's away
for months and months at a time.

90
00:13:08,381 --> 00:13:10,061
I just don't understand.

91
00:13:10,301 --> 00:13:13,941
I'll let him explain it. Can you take him
to the airport in the morning?

92
00:13:14,181 --> 00:13:17,901
- Sam's getting on a plane?
- He joined the Scholastic Decathlon Team.

93
00:13:18,101 --> 00:13:22,701
- They're competing in New York.
- Sam joined a team?

94
00:13:23,181 --> 00:13:25,541
- yeah, I think there's a girl involved.
- Oh.

95
00:13:25,701 --> 00:13:27,461
Look, can you pick him up at 8:30?

96
00:13:27,821 --> 00:13:29,981
I gotta go because I'm on call tonight.

97
00:13:30,141 --> 00:13:32,861
Don't be late. I don't want
him taking a taxi again.

98
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:37,141
All right. Okay. I'll be there.
Okay? I'll be there.

99
00:13:40,701 --> 00:13:44,661
This morning's weather staff meeting
has been moved to level 4, room B.

100
00:13:47,741 --> 00:13:49,341
Jack?

101
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:56,941
I know you're good at rubbing
people the wrong way ...

102
00:13:57,141 --> 00:14:00,341
but why would you aggravate
the vice president?

103
00:14:00,501 --> 00:14:03,461
Because my 17 year-old kid
knows more science than he does.

104
00:14:03,621 --> 00:14:06,301
Your 17 year-old kid
does not control our budget.

105
00:14:06,461 --> 00:14:09,061
- Who cares if he hates you.
- My son doesn't hate me.

106
00:14:09,221 --> 00:14:11,181
If Raymond Becker pulls our budget ...

107
00:14:11,341 --> 00:14:15,701
- Oh, shit!
- Wait ... Will you ...? Jack.

108
00:14:21,381 --> 00:14:23,581
Oh, my God.

109
00:14:29,581 --> 00:14:32,261
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- Dad, the cab's already here.

110
00:14:32,421 --> 00:14:34,421
That's okay. I'll take care of it.

111
00:14:34,581 --> 00:14:35,861
- What are ...?
- Here you go.

112
00:14:38,381 --> 00:14:41,621
I'm not angry. I'm disappointed.

113
00:14:41,781 --> 00:14:45,021
- Do you want to hear my side of it?
- How can there be two sides?

114
00:14:45,181 --> 00:14:48,901
I got every question right on the final.
Mr. Spengler failed me ...

115
00:14:49,101 --> 00:14:51,581
because I didn't write the solutions.
- Why not?

116
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:54,341
I do them in my head.

117
00:14:54,501 --> 00:14:57,301
- Did you tell him that?
- I did. He didn't believe me.

118
00:14:57,461 --> 00:15:00,261
He said if he can't do them in his head,
I'm cheating.

119
00:15:00,741 --> 00:15:03,821
Ridiculous. How can he fail you
for being smarter than he is?

120
00:15:04,221 --> 00:15:06,541
That's what I said.

121
00:15:06,981 --> 00:15:08,461
You did?

122
00:15:10,181 --> 00:15:12,701
- How'd he take it?
- He flunked me, remember?

123
00:15:14,021 --> 00:15:15,941
Oh, yeah.

124
00:15:18,621 --> 00:15:23,101
Sam, I'm sorry.
I jumped to conclusions.

125
00:15:23,781 --> 00:15:27,261
I'm gonna call this guy
and have a word with him.

126
00:15:27,461 --> 00:15:28,741
We'll straighten this out.

127
00:15:28,981 --> 00:15:30,621
Hey, you can't park there.

128
00:15:30,781 --> 00:15:33,061
- Don't worry about it.
- Sam?

129
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:35,261
Sam.

130
00:15:49,301 --> 00:15:51,741
Parker, this is Houston.

131
00:15:51,901 --> 00:15:54,621
We're seeing some bad weather
over Canaveral.

132
00:15:54,821 --> 00:15:57,461
It doesn't look like you're
coming back this week.

133
00:15:57,621 --> 00:15:59,661
Your wife's gonna give me an earful.

134
00:15:59,821 --> 00:16:01,461
Roger that.

135
00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:05,781
Hey, come take a look at this
storm system. It's enormous.

136
00:16:39,221 --> 00:16:40,981
You all right?

137
00:16:43,621 --> 00:16:45,541
He's afraid of flying.

138
00:16:45,701 --> 00:16:47,461
I'm fine.

139
00:16:55,501 --> 00:16:59,301
Statistically, the chance of a plane
going down because of turbulence ...

140
00:16:59,461 --> 00:17:04,021
is less than, what, one in a billion?
Or is it a million?

141
00:17:04,981 --> 00:17:07,381
- I can't remember if it's a ...
- Shut up, Brian.

142
00:17:07,581 --> 00:17:08,981
Listen, Sam ...

143
00:17:09,141 --> 00:17:12,061
don't pay attention to him, okay?
Everything's fine.

144
00:17:12,221 --> 00:17:15,021
They're still serving drinks.

145
00:17:28,501 --> 00:17:32,621
Folks, it appears we're gonna have a bit
of a bumpy ride for the next few minutes.

146
00:17:32,781 --> 00:17:35,861
Please fasten your seat belts
and put your tray tables ...

147
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:40,501
and seat backs in their upright positions
until we get through this. Thank you.

148
00:17:41,301 --> 00:17:42,581
Whoa!

149
00:17:42,781 --> 00:17:44,781
Grab it. Watch out!

150
00:18:15,741 --> 00:18:17,101
Sam?

151
00:18:18,461 --> 00:18:20,101
Sam.

152
00:18:23,461 --> 00:18:25,101
Can I have my hand back?

153
00:18:41,661 --> 00:18:43,901
I can't believe I'll be alone
with my mom.

154
00:18:44,061 --> 00:18:47,301
Be patient with her. She's been
looking forward to this holiday.

155
00:18:47,461 --> 00:18:48,901
I know.

156
00:18:49,221 --> 00:18:51,181
I love you.

157
00:18:52,021 --> 00:18:53,301
I love you too.

158
00:18:55,381 --> 00:18:56,821
Hey.

159
00:18:57,181 --> 00:18:59,501
Hey, hello. Bye-bye.

160
00:18:59,661 --> 00:19:03,981
The cause of this extreme weather remains
a mystery, although some meteorologists ...

161
00:19:04,141 --> 00:19:07,061
believe sunspots are to blame.
Hundreds are missing ...

162
00:19:07,221 --> 00:19:12,341
This is very odd. There's a buoy registering
a 13-degree drop in ocean temperature.

163
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:16,661
Oh, yeah, that's right.
That buoy malfunctioned the other day.

164
00:19:16,861 --> 00:19:19,741
I'll see if there are ships near
Georges Bank to get it.

165
00:19:19,901 --> 00:19:23,021
This buoy isn't in Georges Bank.
It's just off Greenland.

166
00:19:23,181 --> 00:19:24,581
What?

167
00:19:27,381 --> 00:19:30,981
- What are the odds of two buoys failing?
- Remote.

168
00:19:37,021 --> 00:19:38,821
Make that three.

169
00:19:49,461 --> 00:19:54,541
Just another typical day in New York City.
Traffic jam, 10 blocks long.

170
00:19:54,741 --> 00:19:59,981
Look here, Buddha. These people,
and their cars, and their exhaust ...

171
00:20:00,141 --> 00:20:02,181
and they're polluting the atmosphere.

172
00:20:02,381 --> 00:20:05,981
Excuse me, sir. We're really late.

173
00:20:06,261 --> 00:20:08,381
We're almost there.

174
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:12,701
- We're only two blocks away.
- Let's walk.

175
00:20:39,301 --> 00:20:40,981
What's gotten into them?

176
00:20:41,141 --> 00:20:45,661
I have no idea.
They're all worked up today.

177
00:20:46,861 --> 00:20:52,021
In 1532, Spanish conquistador
Francisco Pizarro ...

178
00:20:52,221 --> 00:20:57,781
defeated this Incan emperor at the
Peruvian highland town of Cajamarca.

179
00:20:58,141 --> 00:21:00,861
What is his name? Time.

180
00:21:01,981 --> 00:21:03,421
Montezuma.

181
00:21:03,621 --> 00:21:06,341
No, no, Montezuma was in Mexico,
not Peru.

182
00:21:06,501 --> 00:21:09,461
It's, like, Anta-something.

183
00:21:11,381 --> 00:21:13,301
- Atahualpa?
- That's it!

184
00:21:13,461 --> 00:21:15,261
Time's up. Correct answers, please.

185
00:21:18,381 --> 00:21:24,061
That's five points for Woodmont
and five points for Pinehurst Academy.

186
00:21:25,141 --> 00:21:26,621
Next question.

187
00:21:28,341 --> 00:21:34,421
In what year did Louis Quatorze
ascend to the throne of France?

188
00:21:38,701 --> 00:21:44,501
This place is so retro, it might actually
be cool if it were on purpose.

189
00:21:46,061 --> 00:21:48,381
Yeah, look at all these nerds.

190
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,181
Hey.

191
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:52,581
Hey.

192
00:21:54,261 --> 00:21:56,301
You look beautiful.

193
00:21:57,021 --> 00:21:59,181
Thanks. This place is incredible.

194
00:21:59,341 --> 00:22:01,341
Do you believe this is their cafeteria?

195
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:03,301
You played a great first round.

196
00:22:03,741 --> 00:22:05,461
So did you.

197
00:22:05,621 --> 00:22:08,381
These are my teammates,
Sam and Brian.

198
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:10,621
- I'm Laura.
- Oh, I'm J.D.

199
00:22:10,781 --> 00:22:13,501
- Your school's amazing.
- Would you like a tour?

200
00:22:17,221 --> 00:22:19,821
Sure. That'd be great.

201
00:22:20,021 --> 00:22:21,981
Could you hold this for a sec?

202
00:22:22,701 --> 00:22:24,861
Yeah, sure.

203
00:22:25,141 --> 00:22:26,541
Thanks.

204
00:22:32,621 --> 00:22:35,021
Man, you got some serious competition.

205
00:22:35,581 --> 00:22:37,501
Please.

206
00:22:37,701 --> 00:22:41,341
- And I'll bet he's really rich too.
- Shut up.

207
00:22:53,661 --> 00:22:56,981
- Who is it?
- Terry Rapson here.

208
00:22:57,181 --> 00:22:58,621
Sorry to call you so early.

209
00:22:58,781 --> 00:23:00,901
No, professor, it's all right.
What is it?

210
00:23:01,821 --> 00:23:06,781
Well, we've found something extraordinary.
Extraordinary and disturbing, that is.

211
00:23:06,981 --> 00:23:10,421
You recall what you said in New Delhi
about how polar melting ...

212
00:23:10,581 --> 00:23:14,381
might disrupt the North Atlantic Current?
- Yes.

213
00:23:14,861 --> 00:23:16,301
Well ...

214
00:23:17,301 --> 00:23:18,901
I think it's happening.

215
00:23:22,341 --> 00:23:23,621
What do you mean?

216
00:23:23,781 --> 00:23:27,821
One of our NOMAD buoys registered
a 13-degree drop ...

217
00:23:27,981 --> 00:23:30,941
in surface temperature.
I've sent you an e-mail.

218
00:23:31,101 --> 00:23:32,901
Hold on.

219
00:23:34,301 --> 00:23:36,701
At first we thought it was a malfunction.

220
00:23:36,861 --> 00:23:40,901
But there are four more across
the North Atlantic showing the same thing.

221
00:23:41,141 --> 00:23:43,301
This is unbelievable.

222
00:23:44,061 --> 00:23:45,741
You predicted it would happen.

223
00:23:45,901 --> 00:23:49,581
Yes, but not in our lifetime.
This is too fast.

224
00:23:49,781 --> 00:23:53,221
There are no forecast models
remotely capable ...

225
00:23:53,381 --> 00:23:56,741
of plotting this scenario, except yours.

226
00:23:56,901 --> 00:24:00,061
My model is a reconstruction
of a prehistoric climate shift.

227
00:24:00,221 --> 00:24:02,301
It's not a forecast model.

228
00:24:02,461 --> 00:24:04,741
It's the closest thing we have.

229
00:24:05,821 --> 00:24:08,581
Nothing like this has ever
happened before.

230
00:24:08,941 --> 00:24:11,941
At least not in the last 10,000 years.

231
00:24:37,901 --> 00:24:43,821
As I predicted yesterday, the swell
off "Hurricane Noelani" is incredible.

232
00:24:43,981 --> 00:24:48,341
These waves are even bigger
than I imagined. Just take a look.

233
00:24:49,861 --> 00:24:54,621
- Shouldn't you be monitoring the weather?
- This is L.A. What weather?

234
00:24:56,621 --> 00:24:59,301
Wait. What's that noise?

235
00:24:59,461 --> 00:25:01,341
What noise?

236
00:25:12,901 --> 00:25:14,621
Honey, I'll be right back.

237
00:25:16,461 --> 00:25:21,741
The Coast Guard closed the beaches,
as waves have grown too big for ...

238
00:25:21,901 --> 00:25:23,741
- L.A. Weather Center.
- It's Tommy.

239
00:25:23,901 --> 00:25:26,701
I'm in the middle of something, Tommy.
What do you need?

240
00:25:28,141 --> 00:25:31,181
There's hail the size of golf balls
coming down here.

241
00:25:31,341 --> 00:25:33,861
A low-pressure system along
the California coast ...

242
00:25:34,061 --> 00:25:36,821
is creating a cyclonic system
across the L.A. Basin.

243
00:25:44,381 --> 00:25:46,541
- Yeah?
- Boss, turn on The Weather Channel.

244
00:25:46,981 --> 00:25:50,701
- I think we have to issue a tornado warning.
- What are you talking about?

245
00:25:51,541 --> 00:25:54,621
Palmdale and Lancaster are reporting
wind speeds in excess ...

246
00:25:54,781 --> 00:25:58,101
- Hold on a second.
- Conditions highly unusual for California.

247
00:26:18,141 --> 00:26:20,741
We're building a forecast model,
we need ... What?

248
00:26:20,901 --> 00:26:24,141
Priority access to the mainframe
for two days, maybe three.

249
00:26:24,301 --> 00:26:27,181
- Oh, is that it? Anything else?
- We need it immediately.

250
00:26:27,341 --> 00:26:29,381
I would say that
you've lost your mind ...

251
00:26:29,541 --> 00:26:32,781
but you've been this way
for the past 20 years.

252
00:26:32,981 --> 00:26:37,021
- Tom, this is important.
- What's this forecast model you're building?

253
00:26:37,181 --> 00:26:41,821
Janet Tokada, this is Jack Hall.
Janet's a hurricane specialist with NASA.

254
00:26:41,981 --> 00:26:46,621
Jack's a paleoclimatologist, and I have
absolutely no idea what he's up to.

255
00:26:47,061 --> 00:26:49,741
Booker. What's going on here?

256
00:26:49,901 --> 00:26:52,781
They just issued a tornado warning
in Los Angeles.

257
00:26:52,941 --> 00:26:55,981
Breaking news as we prepare to go live
to Los Angeles.

258
00:26:56,141 --> 00:27:00,101
Mixed reports are coming in about some
extreme weather occurring in the area.

259
00:27:00,301 --> 00:27:03,901
Okay, we're now going live
to our Fox affiliate in Los Angeles.

260
00:27:07,581 --> 00:27:11,861
We have live coverage now from our Fox 11
chopper. Are you there, Bart?

261
00:27:12,061 --> 00:27:15,341
Yes, I'm here. These tornados
are forming so fast ...

262
00:27:15,501 --> 00:27:18,581
- Bart!
- What? Oh! Oh, my God.

263
00:27:18,741 --> 00:27:21,181
Lisa, are you getting this on camera?

264
00:27:21,341 --> 00:27:23,861
This tornado just erased
the Hollywood sign.

265
00:27:24,021 --> 00:27:27,301
The Hollywood sign is gone.
It's just shredded.

266
00:27:39,101 --> 00:27:41,181
Bart, what can you see? Is anyone hurt?

267
00:27:41,381 --> 00:27:44,301
I wouldn't be surprised.
There is so much damage.

268
00:27:44,501 --> 00:27:47,221
And there are people down there
taking pictures.

269
00:27:47,381 --> 00:27:50,381
Hey, what the hell are you guys doing?
Go for cover!

270
00:27:50,541 --> 00:27:53,061
You can't stay here! Get out of here!

271
00:27:55,621 --> 00:28:00,621
What you're seeing are two actual tornados
striking Los Angeles international Airport.

272
00:28:00,781 --> 00:28:04,061
Wait. It looks like they've joined
and formed one large tornado.

273
00:28:04,221 --> 00:28:05,861
- Tommy!
- Oh, my God!

274
00:28:07,061 --> 00:28:09,061
Holy shit!

275
00:28:09,901 --> 00:28:12,461
I'd like to urge all of our viewers
to stay away ...

276
00:28:12,661 --> 00:28:16,061
- Jeff, where are you?
- I'm on yucca and Vine.

277
00:28:16,221 --> 00:28:19,341
- I'm on my way.
- You're on TV. You're in the middle of it.

278
00:28:19,541 --> 00:28:23,061
God! Oh, my God!

279
00:28:29,221 --> 00:28:31,181
You gotta get out of there, man.

280
00:28:35,661 --> 00:28:38,181
That bus just got dropped
on top of that Porsche!

281
00:28:38,381 --> 00:28:40,621
Oh, my God.
I hope no one was in that car.

282
00:28:40,781 --> 00:28:43,301
For our national audience
just joining us now ...

283
00:28:43,461 --> 00:28:47,021
we are going live to downtown
Los Angeles right now. Tommy?

284
00:28:47,181 --> 00:28:50,101
If you look over there behind me,
that's a tornado.

285
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:52,741
Yes, a twister in Los Angeles.

286
00:28:52,901 --> 00:28:57,021
It's one of many tornados
that is destroying our city.

287
00:28:57,181 --> 00:29:00,461
There's another one.
That's the Los Angeles skyline.

288
00:29:00,621 --> 00:29:04,301
It's unbelievable! It's huge!
I've never seen anything like it.

289
00:29:16,901 --> 00:29:18,141
What's happening?

290
00:29:18,301 --> 00:29:21,181
It looks like some sort of ...

291
00:29:21,341 --> 00:29:26,421
huge, horrific, terrifying nightmare,
only this is the real thing.

292
00:30:35,381 --> 00:30:37,581
Yes, I'm looking at it right now.

293
00:30:38,221 --> 00:30:39,861
- Yes, it is.
- What's happening?

294
00:30:40,061 --> 00:30:41,501
I'll call you back.

295
00:30:42,501 --> 00:30:46,661
Mr. President, Los Angeles has been
devastated by a series of tornados.

296
00:30:48,621 --> 00:30:52,341
On top of that, the FAA wants your
approval to suspend all air traffic.

297
00:30:52,541 --> 00:30:55,701
- What do you think we should do?
- Until we can figure it out ...

298
00:30:55,901 --> 00:30:58,021
I don't think we have
much choice, sir.

299
00:30:58,221 --> 00:31:01,821
What you're seeing is what's left
of downtown Los Angeles.

300
00:31:01,981 --> 00:31:04,541
Hey, man, I just got off the phone
with my mom.

301
00:31:04,741 --> 00:31:08,661
Excuse me, you guys. I'm really sorry,
but we need to change the channel.

302
00:31:09,061 --> 00:31:13,541
The FAA has grounded
all air traffic in the United States.

303
00:31:13,701 --> 00:31:16,581
Unfortunately, the order came too late
for two planes ...

304
00:31:16,741 --> 00:31:19,741
brought down by severe turbulence
in the Midwest.

305
00:31:19,901 --> 00:31:22,901
- The first flight ...
- So much for "one in a billion."

306
00:31:26,421 --> 00:31:29,661
All right. All right, listen up, everybody.
Listen up, please.

307
00:31:29,861 --> 00:31:32,901
We've got a lot of work to do,
and we don't have much time ...

308
00:31:33,101 --> 00:31:36,701
so let's get started, please. Vorsteen?

309
00:31:37,261 --> 00:31:38,981
All our grid models are worthless.

310
00:31:39,141 --> 00:31:42,101
I don't think grid models
are gonna be a lot of help here.

311
00:31:42,421 --> 00:31:45,741
Canadians report tremendous circulation
moving from the Arctic.

312
00:31:45,901 --> 00:31:49,061
In Siberia, there's a low-pressure system
never before seen.

313
00:31:49,261 --> 00:31:52,221
And Australia just saw
the strongest typhoon ever recorded.

314
00:31:52,421 --> 00:31:55,981
- These things are interconnected?
- We have to consider the possibility.

315
00:31:56,141 --> 00:32:00,141
The only force strong enough to affect
global weather is the sun.

316
00:32:00,581 --> 00:32:03,021
- What's NASA have to say?
- We've already checked.

317
00:32:03,181 --> 00:32:04,901
Solar output is normal.

318
00:32:05,141 --> 00:32:09,261
- What about the North Atlantic Current?
- What about it?

319
00:32:10,301 --> 00:32:14,501
I got a call last night from Professor Rapson
at the Hedland Center.

320
00:32:14,661 --> 00:32:17,021
He thinks the current has changed.

321
00:32:18,421 --> 00:32:20,381
Oh, come on, Jack.
How could that be?

322
00:32:20,941 --> 00:32:23,901
The current depends upon a balance
of salt and freshwater.

323
00:32:24,101 --> 00:32:26,661
- We all know that.
- Yes ...

324
00:32:26,821 --> 00:32:30,661
but no one knows how much freshwater
has been dumped into the ocean ...

325
00:32:30,821 --> 00:32:33,341
because of melting polar ice.

326
00:32:33,661 --> 00:32:37,461
I think we've hit a critical
desalinization point.

327
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:42,221
It would explain what's driving
this extreme weather.

328
00:32:42,381 --> 00:32:45,181
Hedland had some
pretty convincing data.

329
00:32:45,341 --> 00:32:49,461
They've asked me to feed it into my
paleoclimate model to track the next events.

330
00:32:49,661 --> 00:32:53,021
Are you suggesting these weather
anomalies are gonna continue?

331
00:32:53,501 --> 00:32:56,141
Not just continue. Get worse.

332
00:33:00,261 --> 00:33:04,141
I think we're on the verge
of a major climate shift.

333
00:33:09,221 --> 00:33:11,541
What are you gonna tell
the Administration?

334
00:33:11,701 --> 00:33:15,661
- What do you expect me to tell them?
- The government has to make preparations.

335
00:33:15,861 --> 00:33:18,821
- You have a theory.
- Give me the mainframe. I'll prove it.

336
00:33:18,981 --> 00:33:20,861
No.

337
00:33:23,741 --> 00:33:25,661
You have 48 hours.

338
00:33:26,701 --> 00:33:28,221
- Professor Hall.
- Yes.

339
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:31,301
- I think your theory may be correct.
- Walk with me.

340
00:33:31,461 --> 00:33:34,941
Just a few weeks ago, I monitored
the strongest hurricane on record.

341
00:33:35,101 --> 00:33:37,821
The hail, the tornados, it all fits.

342
00:33:37,981 --> 00:33:40,581
Can your model factor in
storm scenarios?

343
00:33:40,781 --> 00:33:44,021
- We haven't had the time.
- Well, maybe I can help.

344
00:33:44,181 --> 00:33:45,861
- Welcome aboard.
- Thanks.

345
00:33:46,021 --> 00:33:48,021
Hi, I'm Jason.

346
00:33:48,221 --> 00:33:50,461
- Hi.
- Hi.

347
00:33:52,501 --> 00:33:54,381
Do you have Peter's CT scan results?

348
00:33:54,541 --> 00:33:57,101
Yeah. The treatments
shrunk the tumor 20%.

349
00:33:57,301 --> 00:34:00,061
- Is his eyesight better today?
- No. No change.

350
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:13,901
- Hi, Peter. How are you doing today?
- A little better.

351
00:34:14,061 --> 00:34:15,661
Good.

352
00:34:16,341 --> 00:34:18,421
Let me listen here.

353
00:34:19,781 --> 00:34:21,021
Can you read that?

354
00:34:21,261 --> 00:34:25,541
No, but I remember the story
from the pictures.

355
00:34:25,941 --> 00:34:27,221
You do?

356
00:34:27,501 --> 00:34:29,541
My mother used to read it to me.

357
00:34:30,021 --> 00:34:34,021
She must be very proud of you.
You've been such a brave, big boy.

358
00:34:34,821 --> 00:34:37,741
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

359
00:34:38,461 --> 00:34:41,301
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

360
00:34:45,781 --> 00:34:49,221
Jack, you've been working
for 24 hours straight.

361
00:34:49,381 --> 00:34:52,101
You're the only one
who hasn't taken a break.

362
00:34:53,421 --> 00:34:56,061
Maybe I'll try to shut my eyes
for a while.

363
00:34:56,301 --> 00:34:58,381
Call me when you get the results.

364
00:35:02,741 --> 00:35:04,781
Frank, is he always so obsessive?

365
00:35:04,981 --> 00:35:06,941
- Yeah.
- Yes.

366
00:35:09,061 --> 00:35:10,421
Does he ever lighten up?

367
00:35:10,661 --> 00:35:12,261
- Not really.
- No.

368
00:35:15,821 --> 00:35:20,221
- How long have you been working together?
- Well, Frank's been working with him ...

369
00:35:20,421 --> 00:35:25,781
since the "Stone Age", but I've only
had to endure two years of servitude.

370
00:35:33,501 --> 00:35:35,021
Jack.

371
00:35:35,181 --> 00:35:37,221
Jack, we got the results.

372
00:35:45,661 --> 00:35:47,981
Six to eight months? That can't be.

373
00:35:48,941 --> 00:35:51,781
That time scale isn't in months.
It's in weeks.

374
00:35:55,821 --> 00:36:01,181
Flooding has caused numerous closures,
including the Lincoln and Holland Tunnels.

375
00:36:01,501 --> 00:36:06,221
The plumbing in the school is really old.
With this rain, the sewage got stopped up.

376
00:36:06,381 --> 00:36:07,861
Where are you staying?

377
00:36:08,021 --> 00:36:10,541
They're finding a place for us
with kids here.

378
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:13,221
You can't get home any sooner
than tomorrow?

379
00:36:13,581 --> 00:36:17,341
Well, look, Dad, I would if I could,
you know. It's just ...

380
00:36:19,061 --> 00:36:21,381
This smell is unbearable, Dad.

381
00:36:21,541 --> 00:36:23,541
Stop kidding around! I want you home.

382
00:36:23,701 --> 00:36:25,381
Dad, I'll be on the train.

383
00:36:25,541 --> 00:36:28,701
Do me a favor. Just don't worry about me.
I'll figure it out.

384
00:36:29,661 --> 00:36:32,901
All right, son. I'll see you tomorrow.

385
00:36:35,701 --> 00:36:38,021
Hey, Sam, guess what?

386
00:36:38,221 --> 00:36:40,381
We got a place to stay.

387
00:36:41,421 --> 00:36:42,701
Great.

388
00:36:42,901 --> 00:36:48,261
So far, the terrible weather hasn't hit D.C.,
but local residents aren't taking chances ...

389
00:36:48,421 --> 00:36:52,021
as people stock up for what is already
being billed as ...

390
00:36:52,221 --> 00:36:54,661
the worst storm season on record.
- Better be sure.

391
00:36:54,861 --> 00:36:57,021
- My ass is on the line.
- You saw the model.

392
00:36:57,181 --> 00:36:59,541
And I hope to God it's wrong.

393
00:36:59,981 --> 00:37:01,661
- Mr. Vice President.
- Tom.

394
00:37:01,861 --> 00:37:04,501
- You know Professor Hall.
- Yes, we've met.

395
00:37:04,661 --> 00:37:07,901
Professor Hall has some information
I think you should look at.

396
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:10,901
We just got these results
from our simulation model.

397
00:37:11,101 --> 00:37:14,221
- They explain what's causing this weather.
- I'll read it later.

398
00:37:14,421 --> 00:37:17,741
- I have to meet with the director of FEMA ...
- This is very urgent.

399
00:37:17,901 --> 00:37:22,221
Our climate is changing violently. It will
happen over the next six to eight weeks.

400
00:37:22,461 --> 00:37:25,021
You said this wouldn't happen
for another 100 years.

401
00:37:25,181 --> 00:37:27,861
- I was wrong.
- Well, suppose you're wrong this time.

402
00:37:28,021 --> 00:37:31,221
I wish I were, but you're aware
of what's happening all around the world.

403
00:37:31,381 --> 00:37:35,741
We're making all the necessary preparations
for this storm. What more do you expect?

404
00:37:35,901 --> 00:37:39,741
You have to start thinking about
large-scale evacuations right now.

405
00:37:39,981 --> 00:37:41,661
Especially in the northern States.

406
00:37:41,821 --> 00:37:43,381
- Evacuations?
- Yes.

407
00:37:43,581 --> 00:37:47,061
Have you lost your mind, Hall?
I have to go.

408
00:37:48,141 --> 00:37:52,261
Mr. Vice President! If we don't act now,
it's going to be too late.

409
00:37:56,301 --> 00:37:58,261
Come on, Jack.

410
00:37:58,661 --> 00:38:00,261
Thanks for bringing us here.

411
00:38:00,461 --> 00:38:04,261
I couldn't let you leave New York without
seeing the Natural History Museum.

412
00:38:04,501 --> 00:38:07,341
Of course not. It's a real fine
collection of stuffed animals.

413
00:38:07,501 --> 00:38:08,821
Hey, guys, check this out.

414
00:38:09,261 --> 00:38:13,981
"The body of this mammoth was found
perfectly preserved in the Siberian tundra ...

415
00:38:14,661 --> 00:38:18,621
with food still in its mouth
and stomach ...

416
00:38:19,021 --> 00:38:23,981
indicating that it froze instantly
while grazing."

417
00:38:29,021 --> 00:38:33,181
It's been 24 hours now since the snow
started falling across the British Isles ...

418
00:38:33,341 --> 00:38:36,421
and over Northern Europe.
It shows no signs of letting up.

419
00:38:36,621 --> 00:38:39,381
No, no, no.
You've got to stop worrying. No, no.

420
00:38:39,581 --> 00:38:43,301
It's fine. We've got plenty of supplies.
We're just snowed in.

421
00:38:43,741 --> 00:38:46,141
Yeah. No, it's all right. It's all right.

422
00:38:46,301 --> 00:38:48,341
No, you stay where you are.
I'll be fine.

423
00:38:48,661 --> 00:38:51,421
Yeah, I love you too. Okay, bye.

424
00:38:52,741 --> 00:38:56,701
- Hey. How's Jeanette?
- Oh, fine.

425
00:38:56,861 --> 00:38:58,821
The ferry just landed.

426
00:38:58,981 --> 00:39:00,981
Must be nice in Spain.
Wish I was there.

427
00:39:01,181 --> 00:39:04,661
An elite RAF search-and-rescue team
has been deployed by helicopter ...

428
00:39:04,861 --> 00:39:07,501
to airlift the royal family to safety.

429
00:39:07,901 --> 00:39:11,541
- Yeah, you think they'll come get us?
- Not likely.

430
00:39:12,301 --> 00:39:16,741
Luckily we've got our own genny,
enough tea and biscuits to sink a ship.

431
00:39:16,901 --> 00:39:18,861
Oh, we'll be fine.

432
00:39:19,021 --> 00:39:21,501
As long as the loo
doesn't back up again.

433
00:39:41,781 --> 00:39:44,861
We've got zero visibility.
Maintain heading and speed.

434
00:39:45,061 --> 00:39:47,341
- What's our heading?
- 035, sir.

435
00:39:47,501 --> 00:39:50,421
Approximately 40 Kilometers
from Balmorals Castle.

436
00:39:50,581 --> 00:39:53,221
We've lost visual contact with you.

437
00:40:17,061 --> 00:40:20,101
- This gauge can't be right.
- Wind speed has dropped to zero.

438
00:40:20,301 --> 00:40:23,261
We have vertical walls
of cirrus cloud formations.

439
00:40:23,621 --> 00:40:28,541
- What the hell is going on?
- The bloody fuel lines are starting to freeze.

440
00:40:38,381 --> 00:40:42,101
Port engine pressure is dropping.
The rotor RPM is dropping.

441
00:40:42,301 --> 00:40:45,421
We've got a flameout on
the starboard side as well.

442
00:40:48,941 --> 00:40:51,021
Prepare for crash landing.

443
00:40:52,581 --> 00:40:55,061
Select emergency fuel.

444
00:40:55,621 --> 00:40:57,781
Come on, you bastard!

445
00:40:58,341 --> 00:41:00,141
Come on!

446
00:41:23,461 --> 00:41:26,261
What I'm about to say
is supposed to be confidential.

447
00:41:26,421 --> 00:41:30,141
Several hours ago, three helicopters
went down over Scotland.

448
00:41:30,341 --> 00:41:33,781
They crashed because the fuel
in their lines froze.

449
00:41:34,661 --> 00:41:38,821
- At what temperature does ...?
- Negative 150 degrees Fahrenheit.

450
00:41:39,021 --> 00:41:40,341
We had to look it up.

451
00:41:40,501 --> 00:41:42,981
The temperature dropped
phenomenally fast.

452
00:41:43,221 --> 00:41:46,861
On the ground, people froze before
they could get out of their cars even.

453
00:41:47,061 --> 00:41:50,021
Can you get a satellite picture
of Scotland two hours ago?

454
00:41:50,181 --> 00:41:52,341
We've got mountains of data ...

455
00:41:52,501 --> 00:41:56,301
but nowhere near enough computer
power to analyze it. Can you help us?

456
00:41:56,661 --> 00:41:58,621
Send us what you got.
We'll do our best.

457
00:41:58,861 --> 00:42:01,821
Thanks, Jack. Bye for now.

458
00:42:02,821 --> 00:42:06,301
This is Scotland at the time
the temperature dropped.

459
00:42:08,741 --> 00:42:11,021
This thing looks just like a hurricane.

460
00:42:11,221 --> 00:42:14,181
Only hurricanes don't form over land.

461
00:42:21,661 --> 00:42:24,061
- Good evening, sir.
- Hey, Harold.

462
00:42:24,261 --> 00:42:26,981
- Thanks, Victor. See you in the morning.
- Right, sir.

463
00:42:27,181 --> 00:42:29,101
- Terrible weather.
- Tell me about it.

464
00:42:33,661 --> 00:42:35,221
Wow.

465
00:42:36,981 --> 00:42:38,461
You live here?

466
00:42:38,621 --> 00:42:40,461
Just on the weekends.

467
00:42:40,621 --> 00:42:43,341
It's my dad's place.
He's kind of never around, so ...

468
00:42:43,501 --> 00:42:44,901
Where is he?

469
00:42:45,061 --> 00:42:48,221
Skiing in Europe with my step-mom.

470
00:42:51,021 --> 00:42:52,741
Is this you and your brother?

471
00:42:52,941 --> 00:42:56,061
Yeah, that's when we took
a bike trip together.

472
00:43:00,301 --> 00:43:03,581
It's been raining like this
for three days now.

473
00:43:14,141 --> 00:43:16,581
Come on, hurry up.

474
00:43:30,421 --> 00:43:31,781
I'm just standing here.

475
00:43:32,541 --> 00:43:33,781
You can't stay here.

476
00:43:34,221 --> 00:43:36,221
I never liked this neighborhood anyway.

477
00:43:36,421 --> 00:43:38,941
It's a mob scene here
at "Grand Central Station".

478
00:43:39,141 --> 00:43:44,341
Over half the platforms are flooded and
service has been suspended on all trains.

479
00:43:44,501 --> 00:43:47,621
With planes still grounded
and trains now out of service ...

480
00:43:47,781 --> 00:43:49,501
that's bad news for the ...

481
00:43:49,661 --> 00:43:53,781
Victor's coming to pick me up.
You guys want a ride to the train station?

482
00:43:53,981 --> 00:43:55,221
Not anymore.

483
00:43:55,381 --> 00:44:00,821
In Nova Scotia earlier today the ocean
rose by 25 ft. in a matter of seconds.

484
00:44:00,981 --> 00:44:04,581
What we have feared for the past
few days has indeed happened.

485
00:44:04,781 --> 00:44:06,861
The cold front moving from the Arctic ...

486
00:44:07,021 --> 00:44:09,701
has created an enormous
storm system in Canada ...

487
00:44:09,861 --> 00:44:13,701
which, incredible as it sounds,
looks more like a tropical hurricane ...

488
00:44:13,861 --> 00:44:17,181
I gotta go pick up my little brother.
Do you guys want a ride?

489
00:44:17,341 --> 00:44:20,621
- Where is he?
- He's in a boarding school in Philadelphia.

490
00:44:20,781 --> 00:44:22,301
If this system moves south ...

491
00:44:22,461 --> 00:44:27,021
we could see a wind-driven storm surge
threaten the entire Eastern Seaboard.

492
00:44:28,981 --> 00:44:30,261
Okay, bye.

493
00:44:30,421 --> 00:44:32,941
Victor's stuck in traffic
over on Fifth Avenue.

494
00:44:33,141 --> 00:44:36,301
It'll be easier to head out of town
if we meet him over there.

495
00:44:36,461 --> 00:44:39,301
- You mean walk?
- No, not in this.

496
00:44:43,181 --> 00:44:44,941
We should take the stairs.

497
00:44:45,101 --> 00:44:47,741
We're on the top floor.

498
00:44:50,741 --> 00:44:52,341
I guess we're walking.

499
00:45:05,501 --> 00:45:07,381
Maybe we should just stay here.

500
00:45:07,581 --> 00:45:09,181
I think the young lady is right.

501
00:45:09,581 --> 00:45:12,021
No. We need to get home.

502
00:45:36,701 --> 00:45:38,661
Hey, Cesar, come here.

503
00:45:39,261 --> 00:45:40,901
What are you doing?

504
00:45:45,981 --> 00:45:48,701
The wolves, they're gone.

505
00:45:48,861 --> 00:45:51,061
Just to give you an idea
of the situation ...

506
00:45:51,261 --> 00:45:54,381
which seems to be becoming worse
with each passing minute:

507
00:45:54,541 --> 00:45:58,101
At the moment, we have flooding
in most parts of the island.

508
00:45:58,301 --> 00:46:01,621
We've got traffic snarl-ups
because the electricity is now out ...

509
00:46:01,781 --> 00:46:05,341
to almost every part of Manhattan.
No traffic signals.

510
00:46:05,501 --> 00:46:07,861
Car accidents, at least two hundred.

511
00:46:08,021 --> 00:46:12,421
And lower Manhattan, we've been told,
is virtually inaccessible.

512
00:46:33,461 --> 00:46:35,941
Can you call Mom?
Will you please phone her for me?

513
00:46:36,181 --> 00:46:37,941
Hey.

514
00:46:38,581 --> 00:46:40,021
That dog can't come in here.

515
00:46:40,181 --> 00:46:42,661
Come on, man. It's pouring out there.

516
00:46:42,821 --> 00:46:45,061
I don't care. Read the sign.

517
00:46:47,021 --> 00:46:49,821
It's supposed to be a public library.

518
00:46:56,061 --> 00:46:58,101
Come on, guys, this way.

519
00:46:58,701 --> 00:47:00,381
Excuse me. You're bad.

520
00:47:00,581 --> 00:47:03,781
Goddamn $ 1,500 waterproof raincoat.

521
00:47:03,941 --> 00:47:06,821
- Please, shut up, man.
- There must be rats everywhere.

522
00:47:07,021 --> 00:47:08,501
That's because it's New York.

523
00:47:08,701 --> 00:47:11,341
Hey! Hey!

524
00:47:11,701 --> 00:47:14,341
- Open up, big papa.
- It's out of service.

525
00:47:14,901 --> 00:47:16,621
It's out of service.

526
00:47:16,781 --> 00:47:19,661
- I'll give you 100 dollars.
- You don't have to do that.

527
00:47:19,821 --> 00:47:22,501
No, really. 200 dollars.
I won't have it.

528
00:47:22,661 --> 00:47:26,021
God, I love buses. This is so much fun.
This is gonna be the bomb.

529
00:47:26,941 --> 00:47:28,221
Hello?

530
00:47:28,381 --> 00:47:31,061
- I can't reach my driver. No signal.
- This is insane.

531
00:47:31,221 --> 00:47:33,901
We're not gonna be able to drive.
We should go back.

532
00:47:34,061 --> 00:47:37,461
- Yeah, I vote for that.
- Are you kidding? We have to get higher!

533
00:47:37,901 --> 00:47:39,301
Come on.

534
00:47:39,461 --> 00:47:41,701
Up to the library.

535
00:47:41,861 --> 00:47:44,501
Calm down.

536
00:47:44,661 --> 00:47:46,581
I can't understand what you're saying.

537
00:47:49,061 --> 00:47:51,181
If you stay calm, ma'am,
I'll get you out.

538
00:47:56,821 --> 00:47:59,181
The door is jammed!

539
00:48:00,221 --> 00:48:01,541
I don't speak French!

540
00:48:37,101 --> 00:48:38,421
Hey, where's Laura?

541
00:48:40,461 --> 00:48:44,581
- She was just right there.
- She's right there! Right there, see?

542
00:48:44,781 --> 00:48:46,261
What is she doing?

543
00:48:46,421 --> 00:48:49,141
Tell them to cover their eyes.

544
00:49:12,461 --> 00:49:16,941
There is a wall of water coming towards
New York City. Everybody ...

545
00:50:01,701 --> 00:50:03,981
- What?
- Her bag's in the cab. Their passports.

546
00:50:04,181 --> 00:50:06,221
Forget about it.

547
00:50:06,381 --> 00:50:08,541
- I'll get it for her.
- Come on.

548
00:50:15,141 --> 00:50:16,381
Oh, my ...

549
00:50:22,541 --> 00:50:24,661
Laura!

550
00:50:29,381 --> 00:50:31,021
Laura!

551
00:50:32,061 --> 00:50:33,981
- Sam.
- No! Brian, no!

552
00:50:34,141 --> 00:50:36,381
Laura! Laura, look!

553
00:50:36,541 --> 00:50:38,181
Come on. Come!

554
00:50:38,981 --> 00:50:40,581
Come on!

555
00:50:43,061 --> 00:50:44,461
Sam!

556
00:51:24,421 --> 00:51:25,981
Professor.

557
00:51:27,021 --> 00:51:28,381
Thank you.

558
00:51:29,821 --> 00:51:33,141
- Is that Neville's handiwork?
- Neville's way beyond stick figures.

559
00:51:33,301 --> 00:51:35,101
- He's 6 already.
- Oh.

560
00:51:35,261 --> 00:51:38,221
No, this masterpiece belongs
to my second grandson, David.

561
00:51:38,421 --> 00:51:41,581
God. I can't believe Neville's 6 already.

562
00:51:45,421 --> 00:51:47,381
You won't believe how fast they grow.

563
00:51:49,701 --> 00:51:51,541
I've got Jack Hall on the phone.

564
00:51:51,901 --> 00:51:54,101
They've run the data we've sent them.

565
00:51:55,621 --> 00:51:57,181
Here he is.

566
00:52:00,061 --> 00:52:03,501
Jack, were you able to recreate
the thermal cycle?

567
00:52:03,701 --> 00:52:05,541
Yes. The storm's rotation ...

568
00:52:05,741 --> 00:52:09,861
is pulling super-cooled air all the way
down from the upper troposphere.

569
00:52:11,901 --> 00:52:15,861
But shouldn't the air warm up
before it reaches ground level?

570
00:52:16,061 --> 00:52:20,381
It should. But it doesn't.
The air's descending too rapidly.

571
00:52:21,381 --> 00:52:23,861
Is this an isolated incident?

572
00:52:26,421 --> 00:52:28,341
I'm afraid not.

573
00:52:28,501 --> 00:52:31,861
We've located two super cells
in addition to the one over Scotland.

574
00:52:32,061 --> 00:52:33,661
One over Northern Canada ...

575
00:52:33,821 --> 00:52:36,861
and another one over Siberia.

576
00:52:37,021 --> 00:52:39,621
And do we know their projected paths?

577
00:52:39,821 --> 00:52:41,101
Yes.

578
00:52:41,261 --> 00:52:44,541
Our previous estimates of six to
eight weeks weren't even close.

579
00:52:44,741 --> 00:52:48,221
This one storm is going to change
the face of our planet.

580
00:52:48,421 --> 00:52:52,261
Here's a projection of 24 hours out.

581
00:52:57,021 --> 00:52:59,261
This is 48 hours out.

582
00:53:01,021 --> 00:53:03,941
And in 7 to 10 days ...

583
00:53:07,021 --> 00:53:09,301
When this storm is over ...

584
00:53:09,461 --> 00:53:12,301
we'll be in a new "Ice Age".

585
00:53:16,301 --> 00:53:18,181
My God.

586
00:53:36,461 --> 00:53:38,301
Professor ...

587
00:53:38,501 --> 00:53:40,501
it's time you got out of there.

588
00:53:42,501 --> 00:53:45,661
I'm afraid that time has
come and gone, my friend.

589
00:53:50,701 --> 00:53:52,981
What can we do?

590
00:53:56,221 --> 00:53:58,741
Save as many as you can.

591
00:54:13,701 --> 00:54:15,341
Jack ...

592
00:54:15,541 --> 00:54:17,781
something's happened in New York.

593
00:54:28,381 --> 00:54:31,221
No, the power is out.
I've been in here all day.

594
00:54:31,381 --> 00:54:34,461
- Who needs help?
- Here. Over here.

595
00:54:41,221 --> 00:54:42,861
What?

596
00:54:43,701 --> 00:54:47,021
This is the last one. Enjoy it.

597
00:54:47,181 --> 00:54:48,701
Greedy.

598
00:54:49,901 --> 00:54:52,261
All circuits are busy at this time.

599
00:54:52,421 --> 00:54:54,421
Listen, thanks for coming back for me.

600
00:54:56,221 --> 00:54:57,941
It was really brave.

601
00:55:10,021 --> 00:55:12,421
I guess I better return her bag.

602
00:55:29,741 --> 00:55:31,101
Sam?

603
00:55:31,581 --> 00:55:33,661
Just tell her how you feel.

604
00:55:37,701 --> 00:55:39,181
Yeah.

605
00:55:44,261 --> 00:55:47,941
- Did you reach your little brother yet?
- No, there's still no service.

606
00:55:48,101 --> 00:55:50,141
Damn cell phones.

607
00:55:54,381 --> 00:55:57,661
Excuse me. Are there any
pay phones on the upper floors?

608
00:55:57,821 --> 00:55:59,421
No, no, no.

609
00:55:59,621 --> 00:56:01,621
- There are some on the mezzanine.
- Great.

610
00:56:01,781 --> 00:56:04,821
- But I think it's underwater.
- Where you going? Power's out.

611
00:56:05,021 --> 00:56:07,501
Older payphones draw power
directly from the line.

612
00:56:07,661 --> 00:56:11,221
There will be an emergency meeting
of all NOAA department heads ...

613
00:56:11,981 --> 00:56:14,861
Oh, God. I've been trying to reach Sam.

614
00:56:15,021 --> 00:56:16,781
So have I.

615
00:56:17,421 --> 00:56:19,341
I tried to call
and couldn't get you.

616
00:56:19,541 --> 00:56:21,581
It's been a madhouse here. Come on.

617
00:56:27,181 --> 00:56:29,461
Are you sure about this?

618
00:56:39,501 --> 00:56:40,821
It works.

619
00:56:46,221 --> 00:56:47,701
I love that picture.

620
00:56:47,901 --> 00:56:50,101
Yeah, so do I.

621
00:56:51,061 --> 00:56:52,421
Where was that taken?

622
00:56:52,581 --> 00:56:53,901
Miami.

623
00:56:54,341 --> 00:56:56,741
Well, where was I?
I don't remember that trip.

624
00:56:56,901 --> 00:56:59,701
Sam and I went with my sister.
You were in Alaska ...

625
00:56:59,861 --> 00:57:02,781
doing research on your doctorate.

626
00:57:06,581 --> 00:57:09,541
Remember what he was like
when he was that age?

627
00:57:10,021 --> 00:57:12,221
Everything was "one more."

628
00:57:12,421 --> 00:57:17,381
One more bedtime story. One more ride
on my shoulders. "One more, Daddy."

629
00:57:19,221 --> 00:57:23,421
Jack. Sam's on the phone. Line four.

630
00:57:23,581 --> 00:57:25,461
- Sam?
- Dad!

631
00:57:25,621 --> 00:57:29,701
- Where are you? Are you all right?
- I'm all right. We're at the Public Library.

632
00:57:29,901 --> 00:57:32,821
- Sam, it's Mom. I'm so happy you're okay.
- Mom.

633
00:57:33,621 --> 00:57:37,101
Can you call Laura and Brian's parents
and tell them we're all right?

634
00:57:37,261 --> 00:57:38,781
Yes, of course.

635
00:57:39,981 --> 00:57:42,181
- Sam, what's that noise?
- Sam?

636
00:57:42,661 --> 00:57:44,381
Sam?

637
00:57:46,621 --> 00:57:49,181
What is going on out there, Dad?

638
00:57:49,421 --> 00:57:51,541
Sam. Sam, listen to me.

639
00:57:51,701 --> 00:57:53,101
Listen very carefully.

640
00:57:53,301 --> 00:57:55,381
Forget what I said about
trying to head south.

641
00:57:55,581 --> 00:57:57,741
It's too late for that.
The storm is gonna get worse.

642
00:57:58,541 --> 00:58:03,541
It's gonna turn into a massive blizzard with
an eye in the center, like a huge hurricane.

643
00:58:04,061 --> 00:58:07,141
Only the air will be so cold,
You could freeze to death in seconds.

644
00:58:10,981 --> 00:58:12,221
Sam?

645
00:58:12,421 --> 00:58:15,021
- Well, what should we do?
- Listen to me, son.

646
00:58:15,501 --> 00:58:17,181
Do not go outside.

647
00:58:17,341 --> 00:58:20,261
Burn what you can to stay warm,
and try to wait it out.

648
00:58:20,421 --> 00:58:24,421
I will come for you. Do you
understand me? I will come for you.

649
00:58:27,621 --> 00:58:28,821
Sam?

650
00:58:29,501 --> 00:58:32,021
- Sam, come back!
- Sam?

651
00:58:32,661 --> 00:58:34,621
Sam, did you hear me?

652
00:58:34,781 --> 00:58:36,061
Did you hear me?

653
00:58:38,661 --> 00:58:40,141
Sam?

654
00:58:41,301 --> 00:58:45,261
- Tell me he's gonna be okay ...
- He's gonna be all right.

655
00:58:45,461 --> 00:58:47,461
He's gonna be all right,
Do you understand me?

656
00:59:14,461 --> 00:59:17,181
I thought you'd drowned.

657
00:59:22,341 --> 00:59:25,781
Let's find some dry clothes for you.
Come on.

658
00:59:31,741 --> 00:59:33,501
Where'd you store the arctic gear?

659
00:59:34,661 --> 00:59:36,501
You can't make it to New York, Jack.

660
00:59:36,661 --> 00:59:39,021
I've walked that far before in the snow.

661
00:59:39,861 --> 00:59:41,581
This is not the same.

662
00:59:41,781 --> 00:59:46,021
Jack, this is not the same.
Lucy, tell him.

663
00:59:48,341 --> 00:59:50,541
I have to do this.

664
00:59:52,701 --> 00:59:54,701
I know.

665
01:00:01,461 --> 01:00:03,501
My hands are shak ...

666
01:00:03,661 --> 01:00:07,101
- Shaking.
- That's okay. Here.

667
01:00:07,261 --> 01:00:09,221
Here. Come here.

668
01:00:12,981 --> 01:00:14,781
What are you doing?

669
01:00:14,981 --> 01:00:17,421
I'm using my body heat to warm you.

670
01:00:17,701 --> 01:00:22,861
If we let the blood from your arms and legs
rush back to your heart too quickly ...

671
01:00:23,021 --> 01:00:25,501
your heart could fail.

672
01:00:30,581 --> 01:00:33,021
Where did you learn that?

673
01:00:35,181 --> 01:00:39,061
Some of us were actually
paying attention in heath class.

674
01:00:41,461 --> 01:00:43,421
How are you feeling?

675
01:00:45,821 --> 01:00:47,661
Much better.

676
01:00:54,581 --> 01:00:57,021
Frank told me about Sam.

677
01:00:57,181 --> 01:01:01,341
I'm not gonna try to talk you out of going,
but there's something I need first.

678
01:01:01,501 --> 01:01:04,261
You have to explain your results
to the Administration.

679
01:01:04,421 --> 01:01:07,301
- I already tried that, Tom.
- I know. This time will be different.

680
01:01:08,021 --> 01:01:10,141
You're gonna brief the president directly.

681
01:01:12,821 --> 01:01:14,901
- Is that the last of it?
- Pretty much.

682
01:01:15,101 --> 01:01:16,701
Okay.

683
01:01:16,861 --> 01:01:19,901
We also found this radio,
but I don't think it works.

684
01:01:20,301 --> 01:01:22,021
Let me see it.

685
01:01:28,501 --> 01:01:30,301
Buddha, keep quiet.

686
01:01:30,461 --> 01:01:33,181
You ain't even supposed
to be in here anyway.

687
01:02:28,781 --> 01:02:30,181
Come on, guys.

688
01:02:37,301 --> 01:02:39,021
Oh, my God.

689
01:03:01,821 --> 01:03:04,021
The basic rule of storms
is they continue ...

690
01:03:04,221 --> 01:03:07,541
until the imbalance that
created them is corrected.

691
01:03:07,741 --> 01:03:10,461
In this case, we're talking
about a global realignment.

692
01:03:11,581 --> 01:03:14,581
This superstorm will last
seven to 10 days.

693
01:03:14,741 --> 01:03:19,821
When it's over, ice and snow will cover
the entire Northern Hemisphere.

694
01:03:19,981 --> 01:03:22,541
The ice and snow will reflect sunlight.

695
01:03:22,741 --> 01:03:24,861
The Earth's atmosphere will restabilize ...

696
01:03:25,021 --> 01:03:28,341
with an average temperature
close to that of the last "Ice Age".

697
01:03:30,661 --> 01:03:32,581
Well, what can we do about this?

698
01:03:34,141 --> 01:03:36,101
Head as far south as possible.

699
01:03:36,781 --> 01:03:38,381
That is not amusing, professor.

700
01:03:38,741 --> 01:03:40,821
Where do you suggest they go?

701
01:03:41,021 --> 01:03:43,421
The farther south they go,
the safer they'll be.

702
01:03:43,581 --> 01:03:48,261
Texas. Parts of Florida that aren't
flooded. Mexico would be best.

703
01:03:48,421 --> 01:03:52,061
Mexico? Maybe you should stick
to science and leave policy to us.

704
01:03:52,221 --> 01:03:53,741
Well, we tried that approach.

705
01:03:53,941 --> 01:03:57,941
You didn't want to hear about the science
when it could have made a difference.

706
01:03:59,781 --> 01:04:01,901
What exactly are you proposing,
professor?

707
01:04:08,421 --> 01:04:13,541
Evacuate everyone south of that line.

708
01:04:19,541 --> 01:04:21,541
What about the people in the North?

709
01:04:23,901 --> 01:04:26,261
I'm afraid it's too late for them.

710
01:04:26,421 --> 01:04:28,581
If they go outside ...

711
01:04:28,781 --> 01:04:30,661
the storm will kill them.

712
01:04:33,981 --> 01:04:35,821
At this point ...

713
01:04:36,861 --> 01:04:39,661
their best chance is to stay inside.

714
01:04:40,741 --> 01:04:42,861
Try to ride it out.

715
01:04:43,661 --> 01:04:45,101
Pray.

716
01:04:50,141 --> 01:04:51,701
What do you think he'll do?

717
01:04:51,861 --> 01:04:53,741
I don't know.

718
01:04:53,901 --> 01:04:55,221
Jack ...

719
01:04:56,141 --> 01:04:57,501
thanks ...

720
01:04:57,661 --> 01:04:59,021
and good luck.

721
01:04:59,221 --> 01:05:00,941
You too.

722
01:05:03,021 --> 01:05:05,141
We're all gonna need it.

723
01:05:07,661 --> 01:05:12,781
We can't evacuate half the country because
one scientist thinks the climate is shifting.

724
01:05:12,941 --> 01:05:16,861
- Every minute we delay costs lives.
- What about the other half of the country?

725
01:05:17,021 --> 01:05:19,341
If Professor Hall is right
about this storm ...

726
01:05:19,501 --> 01:05:21,941
sending troops north will
create more victims.

727
01:05:22,101 --> 01:05:24,541
We need to save the people
we can right now.

728
01:05:24,701 --> 01:05:27,741
We take the same approach in triage
on the battlefield.

729
01:05:27,901 --> 01:05:30,941
Sometimes it's necessary
to make difficult choices ...

730
01:05:31,101 --> 01:05:34,021
I don't accept abandoning
half the country as necessary.

731
01:05:34,221 --> 01:05:36,541
Maybe if you listened to him sooner,
it wouldn't be.

732
01:05:36,701 --> 01:05:39,141
Bullshit. It's easy for him
to suggest this plan.

733
01:05:39,301 --> 01:05:42,621
- He's safely here in Washington.
- His son is in Manhattan.

734
01:05:46,141 --> 01:05:49,541
I thought you should know before
You start questioning his motives.

735
01:05:52,061 --> 01:05:53,781
We're going to follow Hall's plan.

736
01:05:56,141 --> 01:05:57,541
- General.
- Sir?

737
01:05:57,741 --> 01:06:01,061
Give the order for the National Guard
to evacuate southern States.

738
01:06:01,221 --> 01:06:02,861
Yes, sir.

739
01:06:17,421 --> 01:06:18,981
Vivian ...

740
01:06:19,181 --> 01:06:20,981
get me my wife.

741
01:06:39,941 --> 01:06:43,381
Sorry, mates,
but we're just about out of petrol.

742
01:06:46,701 --> 01:06:48,101
Hey.

743
01:06:48,661 --> 01:06:50,221
Is there any chance ...

744
01:06:50,861 --> 01:06:52,301
that it'll run ...

745
01:06:53,621 --> 01:06:55,501
on this?

746
01:06:55,661 --> 01:06:57,261
Are you mad?

747
01:06:57,461 --> 01:06:59,781
That's a 12 year-old Scotch.

748
01:07:21,581 --> 01:07:22,861
Gentlemen.

749
01:07:23,821 --> 01:07:25,941
To England.

750
01:07:26,821 --> 01:07:28,701
To mankind.

751
01:07:30,781 --> 01:07:32,661
To Manchester United.

752
01:07:40,501 --> 01:07:41,781
I just ...

753
01:07:41,941 --> 01:07:45,861
I just wish I could have seen
him grow up. You know?

754
01:07:49,541 --> 01:07:52,381
The important thing is he will grow up.

755
01:07:57,381 --> 01:07:59,181
Amen.

756
01:08:15,741 --> 01:08:18,501
Maybe you should have somebody
help you with that.

757
01:08:19,141 --> 01:08:21,941
Sir, I am president of
the Electronics Club ...

758
01:08:22,101 --> 01:08:24,381
the Math Club and the Chess Club.

759
01:08:24,541 --> 01:08:27,621
Now, if there's a bigger nerd in
here, please, point him out.

760
01:08:30,021 --> 01:08:32,941
I'll just leave you alone
to work on it, okay?

761
01:08:34,221 --> 01:08:37,221
Come on, Buddha, come on.
Do your business.

762
01:08:37,381 --> 01:08:40,221
Look, there's nobody around.

763
01:08:40,381 --> 01:08:43,221
You know what? I'll turn around.
I won't look. I promise.

764
01:08:47,421 --> 01:08:49,101
What?

765
01:08:55,821 --> 01:08:57,661
Hey, man, there are people out there.

766
01:08:58,061 --> 01:08:59,421
I was walking my dog.

767
01:08:59,581 --> 01:09:03,581
There are hundreds of them.
They're walking on the snow.

768
01:09:11,581 --> 01:09:13,101
Where they all going?

769
01:09:13,261 --> 01:09:16,141
They're getting out of the city
before it's too late.

770
01:09:19,301 --> 01:09:22,261
All right, everybody. Quiet down.

771
01:09:22,421 --> 01:09:25,421
When was the last time anyone
got a signal on a cell phone?

772
01:09:25,581 --> 01:09:28,181
I got through to my cousin
in Memphis an hour ago.

773
01:09:28,341 --> 01:09:30,221
They're being evacuated to the South.

774
01:09:30,381 --> 01:09:31,901
We should get moving too.

775
01:09:32,101 --> 01:09:34,741
The water is frozen over
enough to walk on.

776
01:09:34,901 --> 01:09:38,101
We should get going before
the snow gets too deep.

777
01:09:38,261 --> 01:09:41,901
Everyone, wrap yourselves up
as fast as you can.

778
01:09:42,101 --> 01:09:43,541
We shouldn't go.

779
01:09:43,701 --> 01:09:45,581
Why not, Sam? Everyone's leaving.

780
01:09:45,741 --> 01:09:48,421
When I talked to my dad,
he told me to stay inside.

781
01:09:48,621 --> 01:09:50,341
The storm will kill anybody caught in it.

782
01:09:50,501 --> 01:09:53,261
- Then you have to say something.
- I know.

783
01:09:57,381 --> 01:09:59,941
Excuse me, sir, you're making a mistake.

784
01:10:00,101 --> 01:10:03,021
What? Listen son, we're all scared,
but we've got no choice.

785
01:10:03,181 --> 01:10:04,781
- That's not it.
- Get ready to go.

786
01:10:04,981 --> 01:10:08,421
If these people go outside,
they will freeze to death!

787
01:10:09,301 --> 01:10:11,061
Okay, what is this nonsense?

788
01:10:11,221 --> 01:10:14,901
It's not nonsense. All right?
Look, this storm is gonna get worse.

789
01:10:15,061 --> 01:10:17,501
The people who are caught outside
they will freeze to death.

790
01:10:17,661 --> 01:10:20,461
- Where are you getting this information?
- My father's a climatologist.

791
01:10:20,621 --> 01:10:23,221
- He works for the government.
- So what are you suggesting we do?

792
01:10:23,421 --> 01:10:26,061
We stay inside, we keep warm,
and we wait it out.

793
01:10:26,261 --> 01:10:28,381
The snow is getting deeper
by the minute.

794
01:10:28,541 --> 01:10:31,141
We'd be trapped here
without food, supplies ...

795
01:10:31,301 --> 01:10:33,381
- It's a risk, yeah ...
- An unnecessary risk.

796
01:10:33,541 --> 01:10:34,781
No, no. It's not.

797
01:10:35,021 --> 01:10:37,381
We've wasted enough time talking
about this. Come on, people.

798
01:10:37,541 --> 01:10:38,861
Let's go.

799
01:10:39,061 --> 01:10:42,421
- Look, look. Just look for a second.
- Come on, everybody ...

800
01:10:42,581 --> 01:10:46,021
This storm is gonna get bad.
It's gonna get really, really bad.

801
01:10:46,181 --> 01:10:48,301
You're not gonna be able to survive it.

802
01:10:49,581 --> 01:10:50,901
Believe me.

803
01:10:51,061 --> 01:10:55,341
Sir, please just stay. Just stay.

804
01:10:56,181 --> 01:10:58,341
Just don't ...

805
01:11:27,461 --> 01:11:30,581
- She's set to go.
- Come on, straight to the back, guys.

806
01:11:30,781 --> 01:11:32,861
It'll be impossible to reach each other.

807
01:11:33,021 --> 01:11:35,701
Leave a message for me
at the embassy in Mexico City.

808
01:11:35,861 --> 01:11:37,061
Okay, I will.

809
01:11:38,741 --> 01:11:40,181
I love you.

810
01:11:43,581 --> 01:11:45,981
I love you, Jack.

811
01:11:46,821 --> 01:11:49,741
Tell Sam I love him so much.

812
01:11:51,261 --> 01:11:53,181
God be with you.

813
01:12:00,341 --> 01:12:02,381
- Doctor Hall?
- Yeah.

814
01:12:02,541 --> 01:12:04,941
We haven't been able
to reach Peter's parents.

815
01:12:05,101 --> 01:12:08,661
- I'm gonna try later, okay?
- Okay. Thank you.

816
01:12:16,061 --> 01:12:17,901
I got it.

817
01:12:18,861 --> 01:12:21,501
You're supposed to be on a bus
heading south.

818
01:12:21,661 --> 01:12:26,141
I've been watching your back for 20 years.
You think I'd let you go alone?

819
01:12:26,341 --> 01:12:29,581
And all these years I thought
I was watching your back.

820
01:12:29,741 --> 01:12:31,501
Where are the keys?

821
01:12:31,661 --> 01:12:33,421
In the truck.

822
01:12:33,981 --> 01:12:36,421
Where do you think you're going?

823
01:12:36,581 --> 01:12:39,021
Neither one of you can navigate
worth a damn.

824
01:12:39,181 --> 01:12:41,181
Without me, you'll end up in Cleveland.

825
01:12:43,381 --> 01:12:46,581
I'll try to give you updates on
the storm as it heads your way.

826
01:12:47,141 --> 01:12:49,101
Good luck, Jack.

827
01:13:02,821 --> 01:13:05,541
Breaking news from
the U.S.-Mexico border.

828
01:13:05,701 --> 01:13:09,061
Just half an hour ago,
Mexican officials closed the border ...

829
01:13:09,221 --> 01:13:12,901
in the light of so many U.S. refugees
who are fleeing south ...

830
01:13:13,061 --> 01:13:15,301
in the wake of the approaching storm.

831
01:13:15,501 --> 01:13:18,461
These people came in anticipation
of crossing into Mexico.

832
01:13:18,661 --> 01:13:20,821
Instead, they've been met
with closed gates.

833
01:13:21,021 --> 01:13:24,341
And now, in a dramatic reversal
of illegal immigration ...

834
01:13:24,501 --> 01:13:28,061
thousands of people are crossing
the Rio Grande into Mexico.

835
01:13:28,221 --> 01:13:31,941
The scene unfolding here behind me
is one of desperation and frustration.

836
01:13:32,101 --> 01:13:35,581
People have abandoned their cars,
grabbed their belongings ...

837
01:13:35,781 --> 01:13:40,341
and they are wading across the river
illegally into Mexico.

838
01:13:42,781 --> 01:13:44,341
Here it is.

839
01:13:45,861 --> 01:13:49,221
This fireplace probably hasn't
been used in about 100 years.

840
01:13:51,981 --> 01:13:53,661
All right.

841
01:14:00,221 --> 01:14:02,941
- What are you doing?
- What did you think we would burn?

842
01:14:03,341 --> 01:14:06,461
- You can't burn books.
- No, absolutely not.

843
01:14:06,621 --> 01:14:08,381
You want to freeze to death?

844
01:14:11,501 --> 01:14:13,541
I'll go get some more.

845
01:14:13,741 --> 01:14:15,221
I'll help you.

846
01:14:15,661 --> 01:14:17,781
I'm going with them.

847
01:14:19,061 --> 01:14:21,581
Okay, do you have a cafeteria
or a lunchroom?

848
01:14:21,741 --> 01:14:24,581
Just an employees' lounge
with a few vending machines.

849
01:14:32,461 --> 01:14:35,021
We're not gonna last long
on M&M's and potato chips.

850
01:14:35,261 --> 01:14:37,381
What about the garbage cans?

851
01:14:37,541 --> 01:14:40,061
There's always something
to eat in the garbage.

852
01:14:44,221 --> 01:14:46,861
Friedrich Nietzsche?
We can't burn Nietzsche.

853
01:14:47,061 --> 01:14:50,061
He was the most important thinker
of the 19th century.

854
01:14:50,221 --> 01:14:53,181
Please. He was a chauvinist pig
in love with his sister.

855
01:14:53,421 --> 01:14:54,981
He was not a chauvinist pig.

856
01:14:55,461 --> 01:14:57,461
But he was in love with his sister.

857
01:14:57,621 --> 01:14:59,301
Excuse me? you guys?

858
01:14:59,461 --> 01:15:03,661
Yeah, there's a whole section on tax law
down here that we can burn.

859
01:15:03,821 --> 01:15:07,221
After hours of uncertainty,
the traffic is now moving smoothly ...

860
01:15:07,381 --> 01:15:09,581
from the United States into Mexico.

861
01:15:09,781 --> 01:15:13,621
This is only possible because the president
was able to negotiate a deal ...

862
01:15:13,781 --> 01:15:18,221
to forgive all Latin American debt
in exchange for opening the border.

863
01:15:18,381 --> 01:15:22,541
Now, multitudes of American families
are feeling a rush of relief ...

864
01:15:26,221 --> 01:15:27,901
Lucy?

865
01:15:33,821 --> 01:15:35,301
Is Peter's ambulance here?

866
01:15:35,461 --> 01:15:37,141
No.

867
01:15:42,341 --> 01:15:44,821
- Why?
- They've all gone.

868
01:15:44,981 --> 01:15:46,581
- What?
- In the confusion ...

869
01:15:46,741 --> 01:15:50,461
I don't know what happened.
People started to panic, and they left ...

870
01:15:50,621 --> 01:15:52,861
- God.
- There's a policeman with a snowplow.

871
01:15:53,021 --> 01:15:55,501
- He's waiting outside.
- God.

872
01:15:55,661 --> 01:15:58,101
Peter can't be moved in anything
but an ambulance.

873
01:15:58,901 --> 01:16:03,181
I called and left a message
for the county ambulance service.

874
01:16:10,821 --> 01:16:12,381
Okay.

875
01:16:14,661 --> 01:16:17,061
Okay, you should go,
and I'll stay and wait.

876
01:16:17,621 --> 01:16:18,901
Lucy, no.

877
01:16:19,061 --> 01:16:20,901
- No.
- No, you should go.

878
01:16:21,061 --> 01:16:23,021
He's not gonna wait forever.

879
01:16:23,181 --> 01:16:25,061
It's okay.

880
01:16:27,621 --> 01:16:29,621
I'm sorry.

881
01:16:30,341 --> 01:16:33,301
- It's okay.
- All right.

882
01:17:01,621 --> 01:17:03,221
You all right?

883
01:17:03,381 --> 01:17:06,381
Yeah, I'm fine. I just ...
I cut my leg the other day.

884
01:17:10,581 --> 01:17:11,861
Did you get a signal?

885
01:17:12,021 --> 01:17:14,101
Yeah, for a minute.

886
01:17:14,261 --> 01:17:15,581
And?

887
01:17:19,581 --> 01:17:21,741
Man, this storm is everywhere.

888
01:17:21,901 --> 01:17:24,341
It's hit the entire Northern Hemisphere.

889
01:17:25,021 --> 01:17:27,581
Europe is buried under
15 feet of snow ...

890
01:17:27,741 --> 01:17:30,501
and they say it's gonna get
just as bad here.

891
01:17:31,101 --> 01:17:33,821
I mean, I don't think your dad's
gonna make it.

892
01:17:37,661 --> 01:17:39,261
No, he'll make it.

893
01:17:44,021 --> 01:17:45,901
He'll make it.

894
01:17:50,421 --> 01:17:53,261
The White House has ordered
a national disaster alert ...

895
01:17:53,421 --> 01:17:54,861
for all northern States.

896
01:17:55,021 --> 01:17:57,741
Continued exposure to
the approaching storm is deadly.

897
01:17:57,941 --> 01:18:01,901
Remain indoors and take all measures to
stay warm, burning any fuel sources ...

898
01:18:02,101 --> 01:18:05,781
until the storm is over. Roads are
impassable across New York State ...

899
01:18:05,941 --> 01:18:08,301
as far south as Pennsylvania ...

900
01:18:08,461 --> 01:18:10,421
Where are we?

901
01:18:12,421 --> 01:18:15,301
Looks like we're just north
of Philadelphia.

902
01:18:18,541 --> 01:18:20,181
Look out!

903
01:18:24,501 --> 01:18:26,261
You guys okay?

904
01:18:26,461 --> 01:18:27,821
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

905
01:18:33,901 --> 01:18:36,901
- Once again, roads across the ...
- Sorry, boss.

906
01:18:37,821 --> 01:18:40,221
Unpack the snowshoes.

907
01:18:40,421 --> 01:18:42,341
We're walking from here.

908
01:18:43,901 --> 01:18:46,741
Come on, ma'am.
Let's get up and get going.

909
01:18:47,901 --> 01:18:51,621
We've only made it to Brooklyn.
Maybe we should just turn back.

910
01:18:51,781 --> 01:18:55,381
Why? Half the city's frozen under water.
There's nothing to go back to.

911
01:18:55,541 --> 01:18:57,141
Time to get up and keep moving.

912
01:18:57,301 --> 01:19:00,141
What we should've done
is stayed in the library.

913
01:19:01,701 --> 01:19:04,461
Okay, guys, let's get moving.

914
01:19:14,021 --> 01:19:15,981
Wake up.

915
01:19:33,541 --> 01:19:35,061
What are you doing?

916
01:19:35,221 --> 01:19:36,901
Insulating.

917
01:19:37,101 --> 01:19:39,541
Newspaper's best, but this'll do.

918
01:19:39,861 --> 01:19:43,701
You know, you spend some years on the
streets and you learn how to keep warm.

919
01:19:44,821 --> 01:19:46,621
Hey.

920
01:19:51,901 --> 01:19:53,701
Thanks.

921
01:19:57,381 --> 01:19:59,381
I got one.

922
01:19:59,581 --> 01:20:01,621
Your favorite vacation.

923
01:20:03,301 --> 01:20:05,261
Besides this one?

924
01:20:06,221 --> 01:20:07,581
All right.

925
01:20:07,741 --> 01:20:11,941
I went to Greenland with my dad on one
of his research trips a few years ago ...

926
01:20:14,341 --> 01:20:18,861
and the ship broke down,
and we got stuck.

927
01:20:19,901 --> 01:20:22,501
And it rained constantly.

928
01:20:24,381 --> 01:20:26,661
That sounds really boring.

929
01:20:27,861 --> 01:20:30,341
But actually really nice, you know?

930
01:20:30,501 --> 01:20:33,941
Just me and my dad
hanging out for 10 days.

931
01:21:46,541 --> 01:21:48,261
Frank!

932
01:21:48,621 --> 01:21:50,261
Are you all right?

933
01:21:50,421 --> 01:21:51,621
I'm fine.

934
01:21:53,381 --> 01:21:56,101
I just dropped in to do a
little shopping.

935
01:21:57,421 --> 01:21:58,981
I gotta lose this sled.

936
01:22:15,261 --> 01:22:18,061
Hold on! We'll pull you up.

937
01:22:20,541 --> 01:22:23,501
Jason! you've got to support
Frank's weight.

938
01:22:23,701 --> 01:22:26,461
Okay, I'll try.

939
01:22:32,861 --> 01:22:35,461
Okay, I think I have his weight now.

940
01:22:35,621 --> 01:22:37,341
I'm coming to you.

941
01:22:50,061 --> 01:22:52,701
The glass is breaking!

942
01:22:54,861 --> 01:22:56,341
Too much weight.

943
01:23:00,261 --> 01:23:01,741
It's not gonna hold.

944
01:23:11,581 --> 01:23:12,821
No. No.

945
01:23:13,261 --> 01:23:16,141
Frank. I can get you out.

946
01:23:18,501 --> 01:23:20,021
Don't do it!

947
01:23:20,181 --> 01:23:22,621
- No, Frank, no!
- Frank, no!

948
01:23:24,261 --> 01:23:26,101
Frank!

949
01:24:09,661 --> 01:24:11,541
What have you got there?

950
01:24:12,461 --> 01:24:14,821
A Gutenberg Bible.

951
01:24:15,021 --> 01:24:17,341
It was in the rare books room.

952
01:24:18,661 --> 01:24:20,341
You think God's gonna save you?

953
01:24:21,101 --> 01:24:23,861
No. I don't believe in God.

954
01:24:24,541 --> 01:24:27,221
You're holding onto that Bible
pretty tight.

955
01:24:27,381 --> 01:24:29,381
I'm protecting it.

956
01:24:32,901 --> 01:24:36,381
This Bible is the first book ever printed.

957
01:24:37,221 --> 01:24:42,181
It represents the dawn
of the age of reason.

958
01:24:42,541 --> 01:24:46,621
As far as I'm concerned, the written word
is mankind's greatest achievement.

959
01:24:46,941 --> 01:24:48,461
You can laugh.

960
01:24:49,501 --> 01:24:52,621
But if Western civilization is finished ...

961
01:24:53,221 --> 01:24:57,221
I'm gonna save
at least one little piece of it.

962
01:25:33,981 --> 01:25:36,101
We heard somebody was left behind.

963
01:25:37,061 --> 01:25:40,741
- We brought an ambulance.
- Thank God.

964
01:25:43,261 --> 01:25:45,941
Thank you so much for coming.

965
01:26:06,901 --> 01:26:08,381
Hey.

966
01:26:09,301 --> 01:26:11,541
Hey, are you all right?

967
01:26:12,781 --> 01:26:14,941
You look like you have a fever
or something.

968
01:26:15,101 --> 01:26:18,221
I'm fine. I just can't sleep.

969
01:26:21,141 --> 01:26:26,701
My mind keeps going over all
those worthless decathlon facts.

970
01:26:28,301 --> 01:26:30,581
- It's pretty stupid, huh?
- No, it's all right.

971
01:26:30,781 --> 01:26:34,261
I guess you just haven't had
time to adjust yet.

972
01:26:36,061 --> 01:26:38,621
How am I supposed to adjust, Sam?

973
01:26:39,221 --> 01:26:43,141
Everything I've ever cared about,
everything I've worked for ...

974
01:26:43,661 --> 01:26:47,301
has all been preparation
for a future that no longer exists.

975
01:26:50,821 --> 01:26:54,821
I know you always thought I took
the competition too seriously.

976
01:26:56,141 --> 01:26:57,941
You were right.

977
01:26:58,581 --> 01:27:01,541
- It was all for nothing.
- No, no. I ...

978
01:27:02,501 --> 01:27:06,741
No, I just ... I just said that
to avoid admitting the truth.

979
01:27:08,181 --> 01:27:09,781
Truth about what?

980
01:27:13,821 --> 01:27:17,221
About why I joined the team.

981
01:27:22,341 --> 01:27:24,501
I joined it because of you.

982
01:27:37,621 --> 01:27:39,061
Hey.

983
01:28:04,901 --> 01:28:06,581
I know.

984
01:28:06,941 --> 01:28:08,181
I know.

985
01:28:08,341 --> 01:28:10,421
- Mr. President.
- All right.

986
01:28:11,141 --> 01:28:13,581
I'm sorry, sir, we can't wait any longer.

987
01:28:14,101 --> 01:28:16,101
We're the last ones.

988
01:28:17,021 --> 01:28:18,581
All right.

989
01:28:33,581 --> 01:28:35,381
Mexicali Control, this is Delta 26.

990
01:28:36,941 --> 01:28:38,901
We've got an urgent message
for high command.

991
01:28:39,101 --> 01:28:41,301
Request priority for landing zone one.

992
01:28:41,461 --> 01:28:45,421
Roger that, Delta 26.
Transport will be waiting.

993
01:28:50,501 --> 01:28:51,901
- Sir.
- Thank you, corporal.

994
01:28:52,061 --> 01:28:54,221
- Sorry for the delay, sir.
- Carry on.

995
01:29:07,021 --> 01:29:08,901
Madam Secretary.

996
01:29:18,461 --> 01:29:20,101
Raymond.

997
01:29:21,021 --> 01:29:23,501
The president's motorcade
got caught in the storm.

998
01:29:28,581 --> 01:29:30,181
They didn't make it.

999
01:29:36,541 --> 01:29:39,101
And she wouldn't wake up
this morning. I ...

1000
01:29:39,261 --> 01:29:41,701
She only had a fever.
I don't understand.

1001
01:29:41,861 --> 01:29:44,021
She's awfully pale.

1002
01:29:44,261 --> 01:29:46,741
None of us has had anything
real to eat in days.

1003
01:29:46,901 --> 01:29:49,901
- It's hypothermia.
- But how can it be hypothermia?

1004
01:29:50,061 --> 01:29:52,101
- We've all been in ...
- Maybe it's the flu.

1005
01:29:52,341 --> 01:29:54,621
No, no, it's not the flu.

1006
01:29:55,821 --> 01:29:57,021
And how do you know?

1007
01:29:57,541 --> 01:30:01,141
Books can be good for things other
than burning. What are her symptoms?

1008
01:30:01,341 --> 01:30:05,061
I told you that she has a fever and her ...
She's got a really cold sweat.

1009
01:30:05,221 --> 01:30:06,981
How's her pulse?

1010
01:30:07,421 --> 01:30:09,861
- It's really fast.
- Does she have any injuries?

1011
01:30:10,021 --> 01:30:12,501
Like a cut that might have
gotten infected?

1012
01:30:12,661 --> 01:30:16,181
She was complaining about a cut
on her leg a few days ago.

1013
01:30:16,741 --> 01:30:19,581
I didn't think anything of it.

1014
01:30:24,021 --> 01:30:25,741
Oh, my gosh.

1015
01:30:26,981 --> 01:30:30,101
That's blood poisoning. Septicemia.

1016
01:30:30,301 --> 01:30:32,421
She could go into septic shock.

1017
01:30:32,581 --> 01:30:34,661
I've seen that before.
That can get bad.

1018
01:30:34,861 --> 01:30:36,861
She needs a massive dose
of Penicillin ...

1019
01:30:37,021 --> 01:30:40,661
or a broad-spectrum
antibiotic immediately, or ...

1020
01:30:46,421 --> 01:30:48,021
Or what?

1021
01:31:07,861 --> 01:31:10,141
I've never seen anything like it.

1022
01:31:10,381 --> 01:31:13,981
There's no point of reference.
All I can see is cloud cover.

1023
01:31:14,141 --> 01:31:15,661
What are you doing?

1024
01:31:15,821 --> 01:31:18,181
Taking infrared image of thermal currents.

1025
01:31:18,341 --> 01:31:23,061
Send to Houston, Korolev,
Your weather service.

1026
01:31:23,261 --> 01:31:24,821
I'll help you.

1027
01:31:25,901 --> 01:31:28,341
Tom? Tom, wake up.

1028
01:31:28,501 --> 01:31:32,901
I just received some satellite images from
the space station. You better take a look.

1029
01:31:44,421 --> 01:31:45,941
How big is this thing?

1030
01:31:46,101 --> 01:31:48,141
The vortex is 50 miles in diameter.

1031
01:31:48,301 --> 01:31:51,981
And growing. The two cells over
Europe and Asia are even bigger.

1032
01:31:52,141 --> 01:31:53,461
Good God.

1033
01:31:53,621 --> 01:31:56,581
This one's gonna hit New York
inside an hour.

1034
01:32:13,061 --> 01:32:14,541
Jason!

1035
01:32:14,701 --> 01:32:16,341
Are you all right?

1036
01:32:16,821 --> 01:32:18,581
Jason!

1037
01:32:34,581 --> 01:32:37,861
- What are you doing?
- There's gotta be medicine on that ship.

1038
01:32:38,421 --> 01:32:41,581
I thought you said it was too
dangerous to go outside.

1039
01:32:41,741 --> 01:32:43,061
I know I did.

1040
01:32:49,381 --> 01:32:51,781
Where did you find those chairs?

1041
01:32:53,141 --> 01:32:54,501
Why?

1042
01:32:55,341 --> 01:32:56,901
I'm going with you.

1043
01:32:58,381 --> 01:32:59,861
Me too.

1044
01:34:03,381 --> 01:34:05,261
Come on, damn it!

1045
01:34:53,981 --> 01:34:56,381
- It's all in Russian. I ...
- I know.

1046
01:34:56,781 --> 01:35:00,021
- Hey, hey, hey, guys. I found it.
- What? How do you know?

1047
01:35:00,501 --> 01:35:02,821
Because it says "Penicillin"
on the bottle.

1048
01:35:08,181 --> 01:35:09,901
Hey, wait. This is the mess hall.

1049
01:35:10,061 --> 01:35:12,421
- We should find some food.
- We don't have time.

1050
01:35:12,621 --> 01:35:16,621
Listen, none of us are gonna survive much
longer without food. Including Laura.

1051
01:35:17,861 --> 01:35:19,141
Okay.

1052
01:35:24,021 --> 01:35:26,621
- Sam, over here.
- What?

1053
01:35:27,181 --> 01:35:28,861
Bingo.

1054
01:35:39,941 --> 01:35:41,541
Brian?

1055
01:35:42,261 --> 01:35:44,981
- I'm okay.
- What happened?

1056
01:35:45,981 --> 01:35:48,021
All I did was open up the cupboard.

1057
01:35:48,901 --> 01:35:51,341
- Well, we can use it.
- Put food in it.

1058
01:36:04,301 --> 01:36:06,261
Pull him in, Brian!

1059
01:36:08,821 --> 01:36:12,181
- You all right?
- Oh, my God, there's more.

1060
01:36:14,381 --> 01:36:16,181
My leg.

1061
01:36:20,021 --> 01:36:21,941
Here, use this.

1062
01:36:29,541 --> 01:36:31,541
It should be over New York by now.

1063
01:36:32,381 --> 01:36:36,901
Satellite readings are showing a temperature
drop of 10 degrees per second.

1064
01:36:52,501 --> 01:36:53,901
You guys ...

1065
01:36:54,061 --> 01:36:56,141
I think we're in the eye of it.

1066
01:36:57,261 --> 01:36:59,101
We gotta get back right now.

1067
01:37:00,501 --> 01:37:04,621
Look, I'm gonna go outside, and I'm
gonna lure the wolves out of the room.

1068
01:37:04,781 --> 01:37:07,141
When they leave, you lock the door.

1069
01:37:07,701 --> 01:37:08,941
Good luck.

1070
01:38:14,901 --> 01:38:17,501
- Brian, hurry.
- I need something.

1071
01:38:18,261 --> 01:38:20,181
Come on, hurry!

1072
01:38:29,981 --> 01:38:32,101
Brian! Brian, open the door!

1073
01:38:36,901 --> 01:38:38,781
We have to get out of here now.

1074
01:38:38,941 --> 01:38:41,101
Brian, get the supplies.

1075
01:39:38,581 --> 01:39:40,221
Oh, shit. Let's go!

1076
01:39:41,101 --> 01:39:42,141
Pull, Brian!

1077
01:40:18,381 --> 01:40:20,461
Take the medicine to Laura.

1078
01:40:51,981 --> 01:40:54,901
We're almost there. Come on!

1079
01:40:55,981 --> 01:40:58,861
Brian! Close the door!

1080
01:41:10,061 --> 01:41:12,381
Don't let the fire go out!

1081
01:41:12,541 --> 01:41:14,301
What's happening?

1082
01:41:22,021 --> 01:41:23,741
Buddha, come away from the door.

1083
01:41:23,901 --> 01:41:25,381
Come, Buddha, come!

1084
01:41:26,261 --> 01:41:28,861
More books! More books!

1085
01:42:22,501 --> 01:42:24,661
How long have I been out of it?

1086
01:42:25,781 --> 01:42:27,501
Couple hours.

1087
01:42:27,661 --> 01:42:29,181
How do you feel?

1088
01:42:29,381 --> 01:42:32,221
Okay. What happened?

1089
01:42:32,381 --> 01:42:37,061
Well, we had to get inside in kind of
a hurry, so I sort of pushed you in.

1090
01:42:38,221 --> 01:42:40,301
I should be used to you
pushing me around.

1091
01:42:41,821 --> 01:42:43,781
Good to have you back.

1092
01:42:49,101 --> 01:42:50,781
What are you doing?

1093
01:42:51,941 --> 01:42:56,101
The eye of the storm has passed,
and we're 40 miles from Manhattan.

1094
01:42:56,261 --> 01:42:57,981
Shouldn't we wait one more day?

1095
01:43:00,781 --> 01:43:03,381
Sam may not have one more day.

1096
01:44:15,421 --> 01:44:17,941
What do you think's
gonna happen to us?

1097
01:44:18,341 --> 01:44:20,141
What do you mean?

1098
01:44:21,421 --> 01:44:25,941
I mean us. Civilization. Everybody.

1099
01:44:28,101 --> 01:44:31,221
Mankind survived the last "Ice Age".

1100
01:44:31,381 --> 01:44:34,661
We're certainly capable
of surviving this one.

1101
01:44:35,981 --> 01:44:39,461
All depends on whether or not
we're able to learn from our mistakes.

1102
01:44:42,061 --> 01:44:45,341
I sure as hell would like a chance
to learn from mine.

1103
01:44:46,461 --> 01:44:48,781
You did everything you could.

1104
01:44:51,861 --> 01:44:53,941
I was thinking about Sam.

1105
01:44:59,901 --> 01:45:02,861
Jack, you know the chances of Sam ...

1106
01:45:14,421 --> 01:45:16,901
I made my son a promise.

1107
01:45:18,141 --> 01:45:20,061
I'm going to keep it.

1108
01:45:43,661 --> 01:45:46,621
Parker, this is Houston. Do you read?

1109
01:45:46,781 --> 01:45:48,781
Roger, mission control. Go ahead.

1110
01:45:48,941 --> 01:45:52,781
We've got scattered reports that the
storm is dissipating over North America.

1111
01:45:53,261 --> 01:45:55,181
Can you confirm?

1112
01:45:56,541 --> 01:46:00,101
Affirmative. It's finally clearing.

1113
01:46:00,701 --> 01:46:02,261
We're over Europe right now.

1114
01:46:02,461 --> 01:46:05,581
I can see landmass
for the first time in days.

1115
01:47:55,821 --> 01:47:58,301
How much further is it to the library?

1116
01:47:58,461 --> 01:48:00,301
It should be ...

1117
01:48:03,101 --> 01:48:04,901
right here.

1118
01:48:09,181 --> 01:48:11,221
I'm sorry, Jack.

1119
01:48:48,981 --> 01:48:50,621
Sam?

1120
01:50:00,021 --> 01:50:01,581
Who is that?

1121
01:50:07,501 --> 01:50:09,381
My father.

1122
01:50:14,221 --> 01:50:15,621
You made it.

1123
01:50:20,061 --> 01:50:21,941
Of course I did.

1124
01:50:49,301 --> 01:50:53,741
EMBASSY OF THE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

1125
01:51:12,901 --> 01:51:14,821
Mr. President.

1126
01:51:16,861 --> 01:51:20,221
I've just received a shortwave
radio transmission from Jack Hall.

1127
01:51:20,421 --> 01:51:22,421
He made it to New York.

1128
01:51:23,141 --> 01:51:24,981
He says there are survivors.

1129
01:51:26,781 --> 01:51:28,501
Thank you, Tom.

1130
01:51:29,541 --> 01:51:31,101
That's ...

1131
01:51:32,141 --> 01:51:33,901
That's good news.

1132
01:51:43,341 --> 01:51:48,421
These past few weeks have left us all
with a profound sense of humility ...

1133
01:51:48,621 --> 01:51:51,861
in the face of nature's
destructive power.

1134
01:51:52,021 --> 01:51:55,741
For years, we operated under the
belief that we could continue ...

1135
01:51:55,901 --> 01:52:01,541
consuming our planet's natural
resources without consequence.

1136
01:52:02,501 --> 01:52:04,181
We were wrong.

1137
01:52:05,661 --> 01:52:07,461
I was wrong.

1138
01:52:08,421 --> 01:52:12,541
The fact that my first address to you
comes from a consulate on foreign soil ...

1139
01:52:12,981 --> 01:52:16,341
is a testament to our changed reality.

1140
01:52:16,661 --> 01:52:18,421
Not only Americans ...

1141
01:52:18,701 --> 01:52:22,141
but people all around the globe
are now guests in the nations ...

1142
01:52:22,301 --> 01:52:25,101
we once called The Third World.

1143
01:52:25,261 --> 01:52:29,581
In our time of need, they have
taken us in and sheltered us.

1144
01:52:30,221 --> 01:52:33,821
And I am deeply grateful
for their hospitality.

1145
01:52:55,381 --> 01:52:59,501
We mourn the loss of a spirited leader
whose courageous order to evacuate ...

1146
01:52:59,701 --> 01:53:04,421
Peter? Hey, you feeling okay today?

1147
01:53:04,581 --> 01:53:07,461
For days, we've despaired
about the fate of the people ...

1148
01:53:07,621 --> 01:53:09,981
who are trapped in the North.

1149
01:53:10,141 --> 01:53:13,661
Today, there is cause for hope.

1150
01:53:14,741 --> 01:53:18,261
Only a few hours ago, I received word
that a small group of people ...

1151
01:53:18,461 --> 01:53:21,741
survived in New York City
against all odds ...

1152
01:53:21,901 --> 01:53:24,741
and in the face
of tremendous adversity.

1153
01:53:24,901 --> 01:53:27,621
I've ordered an immediate
'Search & Rescue' mission ...

1154
01:53:27,781 --> 01:53:31,661
to bring them home
and to look for more survivors.

1155
01:54:02,501 --> 01:54:03,981
Jack!

1156
01:54:04,461 --> 01:54:07,941
It's good to see you.
Come on, let's go get on board.

1157
01:55:03,301 --> 01:55:05,261
Look at that.

1158
01:55:05,581 --> 01:55:07,061
What?

1159
01:55:08,181 --> 01:55:11,181
Have you ever seen the air so clear?
