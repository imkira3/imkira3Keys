00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:31,370
DEAD SNOW

4
00:03:01,536 --> 00:03:04,502
Hey... Hey...
Listen to this.

5
00:03:05,568 --> 00:03:08,414
It says that a man was
skiing in the mountain wilds.

6
00:03:09,115 --> 00:03:12,040
It actually says "mountain wilds".

7
00:03:12,441 --> 00:03:16,289
In the middle of two mountain tops,
he starts yelling for his dog.

8
00:03:16,807 --> 00:03:19,492
- Avalanche!
- Not very clever...

9
00:03:19,593 --> 00:03:23,966
When he was found two days later he
had dug himself six meters... Downwards.

10
00:03:23,967 --> 00:03:25,162
What?

11
00:03:25,463 --> 00:03:26,928
That's pretty normal actually,

12
00:03:26,963 --> 00:03:30,508
because if you're taken by
an avalanche you get so...

13
00:03:30,509 --> 00:03:33,594
disoriented that you
won't know which way is up.

14
00:03:33,595 --> 00:03:36,048
So many start to dig the wrong way.

15
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:39,434
- I would easily find the right way.
- You should just spit!

16
00:03:40,735 --> 00:03:43,694
- Haven't you been in the military?
- No, why?

17
00:03:43,695 --> 00:03:45,951
If you're stuck under the
snow after an avalanche,

18
00:03:45,952 --> 00:03:49,847
- you should spit to find out which way to dig.
- Just lie there and slobber on yourself?

19
00:03:50,109 --> 00:03:53,350
- Slobber?
- It means drooling.

20
00:03:53,351 --> 00:03:55,306
- Dribble.
- Dribble.

21
00:03:55,341 --> 00:03:56,686
You owe me a coke.

22
00:03:56,687 --> 00:04:02,016
The spit will run downwards, so you
just dig the opposite way.

23
00:04:02,517 --> 00:04:06,500
- Gravity, as easy as that.
- Can you remember stuff from the military?

24
00:04:06,501 --> 00:04:08,372
I can only remember my duty number...

25
00:04:09,073 --> 00:04:11,283
69...

26
00:04:12,078 --> 00:04:15,654
- Speaking of 69 Martin...
- No thanks. Not interested.

27
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:18,079
Oh, darn it.

28
00:04:18,711 --> 00:04:21,528
- Of course I mean with Hanna's cousin.
- Kris?

29
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:24,301
- Yeah, is she single?
- She is very single.

30
00:04:24,302 --> 00:04:27,802
I don't know her, but
Hanna says she is...

31
00:04:29,159 --> 00:04:30,740
...Very single.

32
00:04:30,741 --> 00:04:34,366
Do you think there's any chance
to slam it in her number two?

33
00:04:34,367 --> 00:04:36,009
If you spit first.

34
00:04:40,917 --> 00:04:44,543
- Where do you think Sara is now?
- I don't know...

35
00:04:44,544 --> 00:04:47,344
She'll probably be there
tonight or tomorrow.

36
00:04:47,981 --> 00:04:51,690
I don't understand why she bothers
taking the trip over those mountains.

37
00:04:53,857 --> 00:04:56,972
So, tell me about the
boys that are coming.

38
00:04:57,311 --> 00:05:00,971
Ok. Martin, which is
the best looking one...

39
00:05:00,972 --> 00:05:04,902
- Is mine.
- How did it turn out with him?

40
00:05:04,903 --> 00:05:09,267
- Will he finish the studies?
- I'm not sure. Don't think he is either.

41
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:12,147
It's not exactly good to be a medical
student and be afraid of blood.

42
00:05:12,148 --> 00:05:14,982
- Poor Martin.
- Martin is scared of blood,

43
00:05:14,983 --> 00:05:16,528
and wants to be a doctor?

44
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:18,753
- Seriously?
- Yes.

45
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:23,958
Then there's Vegard, who's with Sara.

46
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:28,459
- And then there's Erlend.
- The worlds biggest movie geek.

47
00:05:28,468 --> 00:05:29,573
And Roy...

48
00:05:30,274 --> 00:05:33,274
...the horniest boy
north of the polar circle.

49
00:05:34,744 --> 00:05:38,284
- He's single, you can have him.
- Thanks... Nice.

50
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:52,364
How does it feel to
be on the losing team?

51
00:05:54,614 --> 00:05:58,852
That overtaking earlier...

52
00:06:15,859 --> 00:06:17,269
Ok...

53
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:21,570
Just follow the scooter trail.
It will only take 45 minutes.

54
00:06:22,896 --> 00:06:27,239
When you arrive, I will have unpacked
most of the luggage and heated the cabin.

55
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,383
- Is there cell phone reception there?
- No, we lost that half an hour ago.

56
00:06:31,384 --> 00:06:34,385
Then how am I supposed to make
heavy-breathing phone calls?

57
00:06:35,086 --> 00:06:36,905
The emergency number.

58
00:06:39,903 --> 00:06:41,486
Take care.

59
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:50,475
Mile after mile, after mile!

60
00:07:20,111 --> 00:07:21,938
Hold on a second...

61
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,092
I have a question.

62
00:07:24,093 --> 00:07:26,393
How many movies begin
with a group of friends

63
00:07:26,394 --> 00:07:30,992
going on a trip without cell phone reception?
- Friday the 13th.

64
00:07:30,993 --> 00:07:34,134
They don't have reception, because
they don't have cell phones.

65
00:07:34,135 --> 00:07:35,450
Evil Dead 1 and 2.

66
00:07:35,451 --> 00:07:38,450
Yes, sort of... Except
that also counts the sequel

67
00:07:38,451 --> 00:07:43,202
as a remake with higher budget.
- Ok, Ok...New rule.

68
00:07:43,203 --> 00:07:47,262
- No movie talk for an hour.
- Good suggestion.

69
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,566
It's for your own good Erlend.

70
00:07:50,567 --> 00:07:54,767
If you want to dip your balls this weekend,
you should stop the nerd alert.

71
00:07:56,705 --> 00:08:01,418
And then you have April Fool's
Day from... 1984 I think.

72
00:08:01,419 --> 00:08:03,797
Now that's a classic.

73
00:08:04,753 --> 00:08:08,183
- Don't you agree?
- Yes.

74
00:08:10,165 --> 00:08:11,794
Let's go.

75
00:10:04,865 --> 00:10:09,296
- Damn, I'm so warm now.
- It's beautiful here.

76
00:10:11,871 --> 00:10:16,133
- So, what should we do?
- Watch a movie?

77
00:10:16,134 --> 00:10:20,566
- We unpack and get acquainted.
- I have a better idea...

78
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,425
Left foot on green.

79
00:11:59,448 --> 00:12:01,906
...Already is.

80
00:12:01,907 --> 00:12:04,271
Why do we even play this game?

81
00:12:04,272 --> 00:12:08,586
Because Hollywood told
us it is great fun.

82
00:12:08,587 --> 00:12:13,201
- Right foot on red.
- It has to be the most boring game...

83
00:12:13,302 --> 00:12:15,650
That... ever...

84
00:12:19,521 --> 00:12:21,439
- No joking?
- Of course.

85
00:12:28,402 --> 00:12:29,850
One more time?

86
00:12:29,851 --> 00:12:33,350
Lie down and let me show you
sedation from the Middle Ages.

87
00:12:33,351 --> 00:12:36,889
- What are you doing?
- Like that. Put your arms behind... There.

88
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:39,532
- You're sitting on my hands.
- It's how it works.

89
00:12:39,567 --> 00:12:41,906
- Now close your eyes.
- No.

90
00:12:41,907 --> 00:12:43,866
- Close your eyes.
- No, I'm not closing them.

91
00:12:45,776 --> 00:12:48,150
Don't... Martin, Stop.
Quit it...

92
00:12:48,493 --> 00:12:51,148
Just relax.

93
00:12:58,414 --> 00:13:01,270
- Martin!
- Cut it out!

94
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,476
I was only kidding.

95
00:13:07,477 --> 00:13:11,777
Why do you do that? I get
claustrophobic and I can't breathe.

96
00:13:13,892 --> 00:13:16,811
- Sorry. Look now.
- No.

97
00:13:55,629 --> 00:13:58,894
- How does that work?
- Get some beer.

98
00:13:58,929 --> 00:14:00,687
- What?
- Beer. Beer, beer.

99
00:14:00,688 --> 00:14:02,234
Beer, beer, beer.

100
00:14:34,515 --> 00:14:36,612
Hello?

101
00:14:50,377 --> 00:14:52,747
Hello?

102
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:31,907
There's someone out there.

103
00:15:32,658 --> 00:15:34,803
I saw someone.

104
00:15:34,804 --> 00:15:36,504
It's probably Sara.

105
00:15:37,309 --> 00:15:39,968
- Not Sara...
- Are you sure it wasn't an elk?

106
00:15:39,969 --> 00:15:43,047
I can damn well tell the difference
between a human and an elk!

107
00:15:48,668 --> 00:15:50,467
I don't see anything.

108
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,076
There's nothing here. Vegard was right,
it was probably just an animal.

109
00:15:58,077 --> 00:16:01,791
Typical women. They get
frightened by everything.

110
00:16:12,493 --> 00:16:15,130
Is it possible to get
a cup of coffee here?

111
00:16:43,222 --> 00:16:44,950
Who made the coffee?

112
00:16:49,522 --> 00:16:51,550
Ecological...

113
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:56,775
- Didn't it taste good?
- No, it didn't.

114
00:17:16,844 --> 00:17:19,794
What are you nice kids
doing at a place like this?

115
00:17:19,835 --> 00:17:21,836
Easter vacation.

116
00:17:22,454 --> 00:17:26,100
- Is it your cabin?
- No, my girlfriend's.

117
00:17:28,046 --> 00:17:31,958
And who's the lucky one?

118
00:17:31,959 --> 00:17:32,823
She's not here right now

119
00:17:32,858 --> 00:17:35,897
- she's skiing across Istind.
- Across Istind?

120
00:17:35,898 --> 00:17:39,160
She's a bit more athletic
than the rest of us.

121
00:17:42,882 --> 00:17:44,641
Is the...

122
00:17:45,442 --> 00:17:47,241
Is the terrain dangerous?

123
00:17:47,242 --> 00:17:51,729
The terrain is the least of your
problems up there, put it that way.

124
00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:02,311
I presume you spoiled little shit-heads didn't
bother to check out the local history

125
00:18:02,312 --> 00:18:06,821
before you came waltzing in on that
bloody snow tractor of yours.

126
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:09,979
Things have happened here...

127
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:12,880
Things that people
don't like to talk about.

128
00:18:12,918 --> 00:18:18,686
During World War II, Ã˜ksfjord was an
important location for the Germans. It was...

129
00:18:18,687 --> 00:18:22,168
Almost like a middle station
for German destroyers.

130
00:18:22,169 --> 00:18:27,461
It was an important link to stop
convoys between Britain and Russia.

131
00:18:30,204 --> 00:18:32,357
"Einsatz"

132
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:39,161
That was the name of the forces
that were stationed there.

133
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:43,064
In contrast to most places where...

134
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:47,990
the Germans got along with the civilians,
but that was not the case here.

135
00:18:48,091 --> 00:18:50,791
It was under the leadership of...

136
00:18:51,234 --> 00:18:54,309
Colonel Herzog.

137
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:58,080
So the civilians went through hell.

138
00:18:59,073 --> 00:19:02,616
The people were tortured, beaten
and maltreated every day.

139
00:19:03,668 --> 00:19:05,801
Trust me when I tell you...

140
00:19:06,991 --> 00:19:10,468
These were evil hellish bastards.

141
00:19:16,259 --> 00:19:20,334
It was towards the end of the war
when they stepped over the line.

142
00:19:21,795 --> 00:19:25,932
The Germans started to realize they were
beaten, and the Russians were on their way.

143
00:19:25,961 --> 00:19:29,982
So the Germans went into
every house and stole all

144
00:19:29,983 --> 00:19:33,452
gold, silver and shiny
items they could find.

145
00:19:34,475 --> 00:19:37,104
Those who protested...

146
00:19:37,105 --> 00:19:39,805
got a bullet between their eyes.

147
00:19:39,924 --> 00:19:45,373
But they got one hell
of a surprise afterwards.

148
00:19:50,619 --> 00:19:54,033
The citizens had secretly teamed up.

149
00:19:54,445 --> 00:19:56,909
And decided that enough was enough.

150
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:59,946
All the anger and rage the
3,000 citizens had built up

151
00:19:59,947 --> 00:20:03,403
during the last three years
needed to be unleashed.

152
00:20:03,404 --> 00:20:06,474
So they had started gathering
all the weapons they could find.

153
00:20:06,475 --> 00:20:10,929
That was basically scythes,
axes, knives, shovels...

154
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:16,663
Everything that could break a skull.

155
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,388
So...

156
00:20:26,389 --> 00:20:30,089
they ambushed the bastards
in the middle of the night.

157
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:35,834
The soldiers didn't have a chance,
and they knew it. Several got killed.

158
00:20:40,693 --> 00:20:43,572
But the devil himself...

159
00:20:44,691 --> 00:20:48,825
Colonel Herzog with several
of his men managed to escape.

160
00:20:48,926 --> 00:20:50,885
They ran up in the mountains.

161
00:20:50,886 --> 00:20:54,660
And took with them lots of the stolen goods,
the greedy pigs that they were.

162
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:03,105
Several civilians followed them, but
they lost the tracks up in the mountains.

163
00:21:04,782 --> 00:21:06,965
In these exact mountains...

164
00:21:07,542 --> 00:21:10,264
Where they most likely froze to death.

165
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:15,917
Because of that...

166
00:21:16,418 --> 00:21:19,518
people tread lightly up here.

167
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:25,938
There's an evil presence here.

168
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,824
An evil you wouldn't want to wake.

169
00:21:31,825 --> 00:21:35,464
Yeah, we have to be careful
so we don't wake up the evil.

170
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:51,534
I should get moving.

171
00:22:01,211 --> 00:22:02,175
Remember what I told you.

172
00:22:02,176 --> 00:22:06,474
We're actually all medical students,
so I think we'll do fine.

173
00:22:06,475 --> 00:22:10,792
Unfortunately we haven't learnt to banish
evil yet, but I think that's on next semester.

174
00:22:12,609 --> 00:22:17,085
But what if you're holding your own
intestines in your hands. What do you do then?

175
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:21,091
Or if you get your arms and legs torn off.
What do you do then?

176
00:22:22,959 --> 00:22:25,726
Have you learned that yet?

177
00:22:31,781 --> 00:22:33,707
Thanks for the coffee.

178
00:23:16,336 --> 00:23:17,633
Sara?

179
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:34,650
Sara?

180
00:23:36,151 --> 00:23:38,051
Sara...

181
00:24:06,259 --> 00:24:07,859
Sara?

182
00:24:12,187 --> 00:24:14,154
Sara?

183
00:25:04,524 --> 00:25:06,696
Hello?

184
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:11,889
Is there anybody there?

185
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:15,392
Hello?

186
00:25:29,272 --> 00:25:32,401
I have a weapon.

187
00:27:20,936 --> 00:27:23,486
Are you sure we shouldn't
wait till tomorrow?

188
00:27:23,487 --> 00:27:25,686
She'll probably be here during the day.

189
00:27:25,687 --> 00:27:27,562
It's no problem.

190
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:30,363
You're probably right...

191
00:27:30,564 --> 00:27:32,564
I just have a bad feeling.

192
00:27:33,063 --> 00:27:34,480
She'll probably be here soon.

193
00:27:34,481 --> 00:27:35,981
Listen...

194
00:27:35,982 --> 00:27:37,882
If I'm not back tomorrow...

195
00:27:38,211 --> 00:27:39,308
Just listen!

196
00:27:39,409 --> 00:27:41,709
If I'm not back tomorrow...

197
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:43,810
Follow the scooter trails
back down to the car...

198
00:27:43,811 --> 00:27:46,211
And get help, ok?

199
00:27:46,515 --> 00:27:49,021
- Ok.
- Ok.

200
00:27:52,538 --> 00:27:55,190
I'll go find her.

201
00:27:57,662 --> 00:28:01,919
- See you later.
- Drive carefully.

202
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:16,888
Ok boys, we want a clean race.

203
00:28:16,889 --> 00:28:20,010
You'll start at my signal,
and no dirty tricks.

204
00:28:20,045 --> 00:28:23,131
- Please, just one dirty trick.
- Not even one.

205
00:28:23,132 --> 00:28:25,530
Are the drivers ready?

206
00:28:29,218 --> 00:28:32,266
On your marks... Get set... Go!

207
00:29:24,152 --> 00:29:26,648
Erlend!

208
00:30:23,024 --> 00:30:25,242
Hello?

209
00:30:38,933 --> 00:30:41,165
Hello?

210
00:30:43,286 --> 00:30:44,830
Hello?

211
00:30:47,788 --> 00:30:50,395
Hi.

212
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:23,854
Ah, fuck!

213
00:31:32,466 --> 00:31:35,961
Calling Doctor Hovden...
Dr. Hovden to the emergency room.

214
00:31:37,297 --> 00:31:40,761
I see you're not exactly rid
of that little problem of yours.

215
00:31:40,762 --> 00:31:43,362
I assume there's not much
action when Aunt Flow visits.

216
00:31:43,719 --> 00:31:45,291
God damn, you're so childish.

217
00:31:45,292 --> 00:31:48,292
How the hell are you going to manage?
Six years of medical studies

218
00:31:48,327 --> 00:31:50,918
and you still almost vomit from a tiny cut.

219
00:31:50,919 --> 00:31:52,929
You can be a baker perhaps?

220
00:31:54,289 --> 00:31:56,976
- Does anyone want a beer?
- Are you ok?

221
00:31:56,977 --> 00:31:59,006
- Yeah...
- Sorry.

222
00:32:06,081 --> 00:32:07,558
Cunt bag!

223
00:32:27,864 --> 00:32:30,216
Check this out.

224
00:32:46,395 --> 00:32:49,268
It says 1942.

225
00:32:50,044 --> 00:32:52,525
- 1942?
- Hey, hey, it's mine.

226
00:32:52,526 --> 00:32:56,102
Let's wait till Sara and Vegard return.
We won't touch it before then.

227
00:33:11,067 --> 00:33:14,539
SARA!

228
00:33:41,954 --> 00:33:43,890
Sara!

229
00:34:04,234 --> 00:34:10,507
We are two small pretty ladies.

230
00:34:13,252 --> 00:34:15,952
Hey, hey. Let's not get crazy here.

231
00:34:16,456 --> 00:34:21,423
- We don't know who it belongs to.
- That box has been here for 50 years.

232
00:34:21,424 --> 00:34:26,347
We just take what we want, cash in,
and pay down our student loans.

233
00:34:26,348 --> 00:34:30,074
It hasn't been there for 50 years,
without anyone noticing it.

234
00:34:30,075 --> 00:34:32,837
50 years? It's 100, I promise you that.

235
00:34:32,838 --> 00:34:37,146
- People have seen it, and it's just flemflams.
- Huh? Fle...?

236
00:34:37,147 --> 00:34:40,764
Flemsflams? Flemsflamsâ€¦? Flemsflams!

237
00:34:44,008 --> 00:34:46,637
- No, I'm going to take a shit.
- Godspeed.

238
00:34:46,638 --> 00:34:49,529
Good luck. Name him after me.

239
00:35:16,596 --> 00:35:20,280
Ok. A joke...

240
00:35:20,942 --> 00:35:24,021
This one is good. It contains
both poo, pee and sperm.

241
00:35:24,022 --> 00:35:25,778
Once upon a time there was a poo...

242
00:35:25,794 --> 00:35:33,660
There are no good jokes that don't
contain poo, pee or sperm.

243
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,518
Kris?

244
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:02,279
No, don't...

245
00:36:55,967 --> 00:36:59,058
- And you think that is a joke?
- It's a good joke.

246
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:10,227
You took a long time.

247
00:37:11,428 --> 00:37:12,828
Did you see Kris?

248
00:37:20,136 --> 00:37:21,927
Yes.

249
00:37:32,962 --> 00:37:34,882
Fuck.

250
00:37:39,206 --> 00:37:40,709
Erlend?

251
00:37:43,676 --> 00:37:45,369
Erlend?

252
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:47,882
Err... Erlend, is that you?

253
00:37:49,289 --> 00:37:51,114
Oh shit.

254
00:37:52,333 --> 00:37:54,192
Erlend, stop that shit.

255
00:37:59,658 --> 00:38:01,580
Erlend?

256
00:38:40,362 --> 00:38:42,784
Help... Help!

257
00:38:50,345 --> 00:38:52,905
Help! Help!

258
00:39:03,667 --> 00:39:06,082
- What the hell? It's in the middle of the song.
- Shut up!

259
00:39:06,357 --> 00:39:08,706
I thought I heard something.

260
00:39:20,342 --> 00:39:22,394
Kris?

261
00:39:25,369 --> 00:39:27,325
Kris!

262
00:39:31,373 --> 00:39:33,365
Kris!

263
00:39:40,867 --> 00:39:45,103
She's not answering. I've yelled
several times, she doesn't reply.

264
00:39:45,104 --> 00:39:46,542
She's probably fucking with you.

265
00:39:46,543 --> 00:39:48,923
Don't talk to me like
I'm five years old, Martin.

266
00:39:51,403 --> 00:39:55,099
Hanna. She's wasted,
she probably fell asleep in the john.

267
00:39:56,779 --> 00:39:59,197
I'll go look for her, ok?

268
00:40:06,429 --> 00:40:09,309
Clever, we'll shoot her.

269
00:40:10,271 --> 00:40:11,910
Take it with you.

270
00:40:14,217 --> 00:40:16,370
It's that maniac from earlier.

271
00:40:20,254 --> 00:40:22,823
We'll go look for her, ok?

272
00:40:28,303 --> 00:40:32,319
Someone checks the outhouse, and
someone checks around the cabin...

273
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,820
Shotgun!

274
00:40:39,146 --> 00:40:41,803
Martin, can't I try it? Let me hold it.

275
00:40:41,904 --> 00:40:43,254
- No.
- Yes, come on.

276
00:40:43,255 --> 00:40:45,082
- Not now.
- Come on, just let me hold it.

277
00:40:45,083 --> 00:40:46,698
No...

278
00:40:46,699 --> 00:40:49,081
- Is it heavy?
- A little.

279
00:40:49,082 --> 00:40:51,082
- Let me check it out.
- Later perhaps.

280
00:41:01,214 --> 00:41:03,148
Can you see anything?

281
00:41:06,162 --> 00:41:10,342
- I have a shotgun here. I have a shotgun!
- Sorry, sorry.

282
00:41:10,343 --> 00:41:11,743
Martin?

283
00:41:13,042 --> 00:41:14,753
Check this.

284
00:41:21,485 --> 00:41:24,471
What a nice trip... Fantastic...

285
00:41:24,696 --> 00:41:26,574
Kris? Are you taking a shit?

286
00:41:27,712 --> 00:41:30,050
Have you dozed off?

287
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:43,022
- She wasn't there.
- Stop it.

288
00:41:43,023 --> 00:41:44,223
She wasn't there.

289
00:41:44,224 --> 00:41:45,211
What does that mean?

290
00:41:45,212 --> 00:41:48,113
She wasn't at the outhouse
or around the cabin.

291
00:41:48,114 --> 00:41:50,269
We found this though.

292
00:41:50,828 --> 00:41:54,217
- Let's see. Maybe she's inside it.
- Stop fucking around.

293
00:41:55,059 --> 00:41:57,589
- It's Sara's.
- Sara's?

294
00:41:58,593 --> 00:42:02,008
- Where did you find it?
- Just behind the cabin.

295
00:42:04,676 --> 00:42:06,382
I get a bad feeling from this.

296
00:42:06,383 --> 00:42:09,452
We have to go find her,
she could freeze to death.

297
00:42:09,453 --> 00:42:15,778
- Ok, we get dressed and go look for her.
- So we'll just trudge around in the forest?

298
00:42:18,439 --> 00:42:21,545
Where did we just come from Martin?
We've just been outside.

299
00:42:26,411 --> 00:42:28,397
Oh, thank God.

300
00:42:50,253 --> 00:42:52,022
I can't see anything.

301
00:42:58,050 --> 00:42:59,737
Pull!

302
00:43:01,031 --> 00:43:02,444
Pull!

303
00:43:08,809 --> 00:43:11,591
Fuck! Move the sofa
in front of the door.

304
00:43:11,592 --> 00:43:13,480
And stay away from the windows!

305
00:43:16,291 --> 00:43:18,214
Get it out!

306
00:43:19,111 --> 00:43:20,761
Come on and twist.

307
00:43:22,062 --> 00:43:23,811
Leave the cushions!

308
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,125
Stay calm!

309
00:44:02,626 --> 00:44:04,226
They can't get in here.

310
00:44:06,415 --> 00:44:07,811
The table!

311
00:44:31,211 --> 00:44:33,809
Martin! Martin!

312
00:44:38,885 --> 00:44:40,783
Einsatz...

313
00:44:40,784 --> 00:44:43,215
Zomb... Zombies...

314
00:44:46,675 --> 00:44:49,500
Don't get bitten! Don't get bitten, ok?!

315
00:44:49,501 --> 00:44:51,671
Stop that rubbish,
what the hell are we going to do?

316
00:44:51,672 --> 00:44:52,858
We have to get to the car.

317
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:12,794
Help me!

318
00:45:37,552 --> 00:45:40,307
I said we should have
gone to a Sunny Beach!

319
00:47:01,946 --> 00:47:04,218
Martin...

320
00:47:04,468 --> 00:47:07,190
Martin, don't bite.

321
00:47:08,683 --> 00:47:11,175
Now it's suddenly totally quiet.

322
00:47:12,237 --> 00:47:15,701
Stay here and become
lunch for the rest of...

323
00:47:19,149 --> 00:47:21,127
- We have to do something.
- Like what?

324
00:47:21,128 --> 00:47:22,928
We can't just sit here.

325
00:47:23,717 --> 00:47:27,413
We must try to find the car.
We find the road back and get help.

326
00:47:27,414 --> 00:47:30,814
Only Vegard knows the way, and
the tracks are covered with snow.

327
00:47:32,795 --> 00:47:35,247
I know...

328
00:47:35,693 --> 00:47:37,943
We have to do something...

329
00:47:37,944 --> 00:47:40,643
We can't just sit here and wait for...

330
00:47:40,644 --> 00:47:43,285
Wait for it to fix itself,
we have to do something.

331
00:47:50,538 --> 00:47:52,271
What if we split up?

332
00:47:52,272 --> 00:47:55,572
Two can look for the car, while
two waits here for Vegard.

333
00:47:57,482 --> 00:48:01,779
Those who eventually leave will most
likely get those bloody bastards after them.

334
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:08,962
If two go outside and make a noise,
it will attract... Those creatures.

335
00:48:09,035 --> 00:48:11,848
At the same time the two
others run into the woods.

336
00:48:11,849 --> 00:48:13,995
Then we'll just run towards the fjord.

337
00:48:13,996 --> 00:48:17,439
There are people down by the fjord,
we will have to get help.

338
00:48:18,294 --> 00:48:22,210
Who will get to be those
lucky bastards acting as bait?

339
00:48:34,505 --> 00:48:36,582
You do something too!

340
00:48:37,411 --> 00:48:40,116
Where are you, you cowardly bastards?!

341
00:48:40,117 --> 00:48:42,499
Are you afraid to come out in daylight?!

342
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:44,300
Fuck, was that too much?

343
00:48:44,301 --> 00:48:46,523
Do you think they'll get pissed?

344
00:48:55,296 --> 00:48:56,850
Come on.

345
00:50:26,621 --> 00:50:28,735
Fuck...

346
00:51:17,850 --> 00:51:20,461
Sara?

347
00:51:34,414 --> 00:51:37,079
Come on!

348
00:51:37,524 --> 00:51:39,325
Cowardly bastard.

349
00:53:18,686 --> 00:53:20,624
Ok...

350
00:53:35,593 --> 00:53:37,594
Do you recognize any of this?

351
00:53:38,495 --> 00:53:40,245
Not a chance.

352
00:53:40,246 --> 00:53:42,505
Everything looks the same...

353
00:53:44,628 --> 00:53:48,167
- Which way?
- If we both go downhill...

354
00:53:57,327 --> 00:53:59,829
- We have to split up.
- What?

355
00:53:59,830 --> 00:54:03,698
One of us have to get down
to the damn car and get help.

356
00:54:03,699 --> 00:54:06,816
- We go to that car together!
- Liv, listen to me.

357
00:54:06,817 --> 00:54:09,586
We don't stand a chance on our own,
we have to go together.

358
00:54:09,587 --> 00:54:14,594
- One of us have to get to the car...
- Please, we can't! I don't want to go by myself!

359
00:54:14,595 --> 00:54:16,916
Liv, listen to me!

360
00:54:26,831 --> 00:54:29,559
You saw what happened to Erlend.

361
00:54:30,696 --> 00:54:33,404
We don't stand a chance on our own.

362
00:54:36,619 --> 00:54:39,483
We have to go together...

363
00:54:45,409 --> 00:54:49,379
- We run together.
- We run together.

364
01:02:35,792 --> 01:02:37,786
Are you sure that thing will work?!

365
01:02:37,787 --> 01:02:40,387
Have you ever tasted
moonshine from Finnmark?

366
01:02:45,251 --> 01:02:47,394
Throw!

367
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:11,677
Hi. My name is Martin Hovden, and we're
staying at a cabin in Ã˜ksfjord... And...

368
01:03:11,678 --> 01:03:16,598
Just up in the mountains. We're under
attack by something that looks like...

369
01:03:17,878 --> 01:03:19,750
German soldiers from WWII.

370
01:03:19,751 --> 01:03:22,312
And now we managed to set the
cabin on fire, and... Hello?

371
01:03:22,313 --> 01:03:23,741
Hello!

372
01:03:23,742 --> 01:03:26,629
- That fucking cunt hung up on me!
- Of course she did, what you said sounds -

373
01:03:26,630 --> 01:03:28,823
- insanely absurd!
- Then what the fuck should I say?

374
01:03:28,824 --> 01:03:31,033
Say that we are under
attack by terrorists!

375
01:03:31,034 --> 01:03:34,234
Say that they have missiles. They will
bring helicopters and all that shit.

376
01:03:34,269 --> 01:03:35,600
Brilliant.

377
01:03:35,601 --> 01:03:38,462
Fucking cunt, it's out of battery!

378
01:03:39,235 --> 01:03:40,701
Come!

379
01:03:41,937 --> 01:03:46,562
- We have to get over to that shack!
- The shack? What the hell are we doing there?

380
01:03:47,140 --> 01:03:48,893
We don't have time for that now.

381
01:04:01,917 --> 01:04:05,015
- I can't see anyone.
- I'll look for some light.

382
01:04:17,437 --> 01:04:20,229
You know what we have to do, right?

383
01:04:21,629 --> 01:04:24,218
- Right?
- Yes.

384
01:09:37,902 --> 01:09:40,010
A little more.

385
01:09:49,460 --> 01:09:52,012
Duck!

386
01:11:00,784 --> 01:11:02,428
Where have you been?

387
01:11:02,429 --> 01:11:04,929
Where the hell did
you get a machine gun?

388
01:11:08,219 --> 01:11:10,779
I've kept myself busy.

389
01:11:15,456 --> 01:11:17,513
Where are the others?

390
01:11:18,121 --> 01:11:23,232
Hanna and Liv are looking
for the car to get some help.

391
01:11:26,884 --> 01:11:28,727
The others...

392
01:11:31,031 --> 01:11:32,958
They...?

393
01:11:38,623 --> 01:11:40,052
Behind you!

394
01:14:51,671 --> 01:14:54,526
No, no, no, no, no, no...

395
01:14:55,587 --> 01:14:56,688
What is it?

396
01:14:56,689 --> 01:15:00,789
Do you remember what
Erlend said. Do you?

397
01:15:00,888 --> 01:15:05,235
Don't get bitten. No matter
what you do; Don't get bitten.

398
01:15:06,210 --> 01:15:09,250
- Then you turn into...
- Isn't your grandfather half Jewish?

399
01:15:09,251 --> 01:15:11,795
You don't think they would
recruit someone half Jewish?

400
01:15:11,796 --> 01:15:14,967
You'll get infected if you...
You'll be like them.

401
01:15:15,791 --> 01:15:19,543
You saw what they did to Vegard. It didn't
exactly look like they wanted team mates.

402
01:15:19,544 --> 01:15:22,421
Do you think I'm willing
to gamble on that?

403
01:15:30,675 --> 01:15:33,557
- What are you doing?
- We had...

404
01:15:33,558 --> 01:15:35,458
We learned about amputation, remember?

405
01:15:39,127 --> 01:15:41,497
What the fuck are you doing?

406
01:16:58,464 --> 01:17:00,725
No, no, no, no, no!

407
01:17:25,634 --> 01:17:28,688
Let's sledge that fucker
and get out of here.

408
01:19:21,728 --> 01:19:23,854
Run, for fuck's sake!

409
01:24:25,079 --> 01:24:27,335
Oh, fuck...
