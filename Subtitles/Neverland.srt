1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:01:17,553 --> 00:01:18,886
What's he doing?

3
00:01:24,928 --> 00:01:27,469
No!

4
00:01:30,552 --> 00:01:32,258
Stop!

5
00:01:35,344 --> 00:01:37,095
No!

6
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:49,261
Fire!

7
00:01:56,885 --> 00:01:59,052
Fire!

8
00:02:05,261 --> 00:02:07,052
She's a-sinking already!

9
00:02:07,178 --> 00:02:11,260
Board! Before she takes
her booty with her!

10
00:02:31,803 --> 00:02:33,803
It's an 'eavy one, Captain.

11
00:02:36,845 --> 00:02:38,552
Oddio.

12
00:02:38,677 --> 00:02:43,009
It's a war chest, I imagine,
filled with Spanish doubloons.

13
00:02:50,676 --> 00:02:52,801
Eh?

14
00:02:52,927 --> 00:02:54,718
What the hell is it?

15
00:02:54,843 --> 00:02:56,469
It's the holy grail.

16
00:02:56,595 --> 00:03:00,052
Don't be ridiculous, Smee.
idiota. There's no such thing.

17
00:03:00,178 --> 00:03:02,886
All right,
it's Aladdin's lamp, then.

18
00:03:06,011 --> 00:03:08,010
There's something inside it.

19
00:03:14,386 --> 00:03:15,759
Aaah!

20
00:03:15,885 --> 00:03:18,176
What's the matter?

21
00:03:18,302 --> 00:03:19,677
It's possessed!

22
00:03:19,803 --> 00:03:22,635
The damn thing's got
a ghost inside it!

23
00:03:22,761 --> 00:03:24,259
Or a genie!

24
00:03:24,386 --> 00:03:27,219
Maybe it'll grant us
a wish or two.

25
00:03:27,344 --> 00:03:29,342
It's not of this world.

26
00:03:50,469 --> 00:03:52,218
Help!

27
00:03:52,344 --> 00:03:53,675
Let me at him!

28
00:03:53,802 --> 00:03:55,842
- I'm gonna kill him!
- Come on, you little runt!

29
00:04:03,386 --> 00:04:04,967
Aah! Help!

30
00:04:05,094 --> 00:04:06,551
Come on, you mutt!

31
00:04:06,677 --> 00:04:08,717
- Help!
- Little runt!

32
00:04:10,801 --> 00:04:13,718
-
- Let me at him!

33
00:04:18,302 --> 00:04:19,675
That's us.

34
00:04:30,135 --> 00:04:32,759
Get him! Get him!

35
00:04:32,885 --> 00:04:34,301
Grab him!

36
00:04:34,427 --> 00:04:36,343
Oi! He's got my watch!

37
00:04:36,469 --> 00:04:38,134
They're thieves!

38
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:41,758
Thieves!

39
00:04:43,009 --> 00:04:45,217
A gold watch.
Blimey, Tootles.

40
00:04:45,343 --> 00:04:47,218
- Ohh.
-  You're an artist.

41
00:04:52,009 --> 00:04:54,093
What now?

42
00:04:59,094 --> 00:05:00,301
What's up, Twins?

43
00:05:00,427 --> 00:05:03,342
Slightly's gone
and got himself nicked.

44
00:05:03,468 --> 00:05:05,009
Any instructions from Peter?

45
00:05:05,135 --> 00:05:06,759
No, he's--he's gone quiet.

46
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:15,050
That's Beer Barrel Bertie.

47
00:05:15,176 --> 00:05:18,758
We don't have no plans
for Beer Barrel Bertie... do we?

48
00:05:18,884 --> 00:05:21,175
Wait. Look over there.

49
00:05:23,135 --> 00:05:25,965
Excuse me.
Officer, you, er, dropped this.

50
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:28,092
What? Impossible.

51
00:05:29,426 --> 00:05:30,966
Must have a buckle loose.

52
00:05:31,092 --> 00:05:33,967
- And, er, you dropped this.
- That's my whistle! Well, how did you--

53
00:05:34,094 --> 00:05:37,092
It was down there, with your keys.

54
00:05:38,551 --> 00:05:39,634
My keys!

55
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,301
Go. Go!

56
00:05:41,426 --> 00:05:42,966
He's got the blighter loose!

57
00:05:45,843 --> 00:05:47,384
- You there!
- Come here!

58
00:05:53,468 --> 00:05:54,673
Whoa!

59
00:05:56,885 --> 00:05:58,384
Yes!

60
00:06:09,592 --> 00:06:13,091
Don't watch his sword, Stevens,
watch his eyes!

61
00:06:13,218 --> 00:06:16,841
Remember, a man's intent
is in his eyes!

62
00:06:48,633 --> 00:06:51,175
Sometimes smaller is smarter.

63
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,925
Jimmy's gonna love this.

64
00:07:12,093 --> 00:07:14,091
Well done, Peter.

65
00:07:23,841 --> 00:07:26,464
I've got a nice job for you boys.

66
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:29,175
- How nice?
- Harbottle's Antiques.

67
00:07:29,301 --> 00:07:31,300
- Are you mad?
- You're ready.

68
00:07:31,425 --> 00:07:34,175
- That place is tighter than the tower.
- We'll get nicked for sure.

69
00:07:34,301 --> 00:07:37,800
Sorry, Jimmy,
too dangerous.

70
00:07:37,926 --> 00:07:41,175
I think it's a brilliant idea.

71
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,758
Harbottle's has two doors,
as I remember--

72
00:07:42,884 --> 00:07:45,257
one at the front and one at the back
leading to an alley.

73
00:07:45,384 --> 00:07:47,673
There is a night guard,
of course,

74
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,674
and the windows
are sealed shut, but...

75
00:07:49,801 --> 00:07:53,049
there are other ways in
if you're small and cunning.

76
00:07:53,175 --> 00:07:55,715
If we get nicked, it won't be
the orphanage they throw us in,

77
00:07:55,841 --> 00:07:58,007
it'll be the clink.

78
00:07:58,133 --> 00:07:59,800
We wouldn't last a week.

79
00:08:04,926 --> 00:08:08,966
Weren't you at the bottom of Hackney Canal
when Jimmy found you?

80
00:08:09,093 --> 00:08:12,465
Tied in a sack, with stones
around your wrist and ankles.

81
00:08:14,966 --> 00:08:17,715
Jimmy's rescued every one of you.

82
00:08:17,841 --> 00:08:21,174
He's pulled you from
the workhouses and asylums.

83
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,424
He's given you a home.

84
00:08:25,216 --> 00:08:27,673
Food in your belly
and shoes on your feet.

85
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,466
Isn't it time we paid him back?

86
00:08:33,092 --> 00:08:34,465
Harbottle's Antiques.

87
00:08:34,592 --> 00:08:38,173
All who's with me,
raise your right hand.

88
00:08:51,175 --> 00:08:53,424
A word in your ear, Peter.

89
00:09:00,632 --> 00:09:02,548
Curly's right.

90
00:09:02,674 --> 00:09:04,589
This one's too dangerous.

91
00:09:04,715 --> 00:09:06,506
- But it's worth it.
- How do you know?

92
00:09:06,632 --> 00:09:08,131
You wouldn't risk it otherwise.

93
00:09:08,257 --> 00:09:11,881
You're growing up quickly, Peter,
but you still have a lot to learn.

94
00:09:12,007 --> 00:09:13,673
Do you want to do this job or not?

95
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,131
Oh, I want to do it, all right--
it's what I've been waiting for.

96
00:09:16,257 --> 00:09:19,049
Might get me back where I belong.

97
00:09:19,175 --> 00:09:21,007
But I've changed my mind.

98
00:09:21,132 --> 00:09:23,381
I'm going it alone on this one.

99
00:09:23,507 --> 00:09:25,506
You don't trust me.

100
00:09:27,092 --> 00:09:29,215
I don't want you to get nicked.

101
00:09:29,341 --> 00:09:33,006
- I'll get us in and out safe.
- No. This one's mine.

102
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,923
Things will be different
when you're older.

103
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,256
Licorice?

104
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,964
What do you think of accounting?

105
00:10:30,091 --> 00:10:31,465
What?

106
00:10:31,591 --> 00:10:32,839
Bookkeeping.

107
00:10:32,964 --> 00:10:34,671
I had an uncle in Pinner
who made bucketloads

108
00:10:34,797 --> 00:10:38,047
from just adding things up.

109
00:10:38,172 --> 00:10:40,296
Sounds a bit dull, Fox.

110
00:10:40,423 --> 00:10:42,172
He had a good life.

111
00:10:42,298 --> 00:10:44,590
Married a draper's daughter
from Bexleyheath.

112
00:10:44,716 --> 00:10:48,006
Cooh. Brenda Fitzwilliam.

113
00:10:48,132 --> 00:10:49,173
Nice smile.

114
00:10:49,299 --> 00:10:51,756
Fox, what are you talking about?

115
00:10:51,882 --> 00:10:54,090
The future.

116
00:10:54,216 --> 00:10:56,215
Something to look forward to.

117
00:10:58,507 --> 00:11:01,963
What about you, Peter?
You ever think of the future?

118
00:11:02,091 --> 00:11:03,838
I'm stickin' with Jimmy.

119
00:11:03,964 --> 00:11:05,714
If you're not careful,
you'll grow up to be just like him.

120
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,297
And what's wrong with that?

121
00:11:08,423 --> 00:11:11,214
- It's a dangerous life.
- Adventurous, you mean.

122
00:11:11,341 --> 00:11:13,798
You want to spend the rest of your days
in a shoebox, fine.

123
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,839
But I want more.

124
00:11:15,965 --> 00:11:18,881
Now, Jimmy's going places,
and so am I.

125
00:11:19,006 --> 00:11:21,129
One day we'll be partners.

126
00:11:21,255 --> 00:11:24,506
Believe me, that day can't...

127
00:11:24,632 --> 00:11:26,671
...can't come soon enough.

128
00:11:26,798 --> 00:11:29,048
- Come on, we got a job to do.
- What? Job?

129
00:11:29,173 --> 00:11:31,215
Yeah, Harbottle's Antiques.
You remember?

130
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:34,588
Tonight? Whoa, Jimmy didn't say
anything about doing it tonight.

131
00:11:34,714 --> 00:11:37,464
Jimmy doesn't have to know.

132
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:39,756
We'll surprise him.

133
00:11:41,007 --> 00:11:44,129
Make it look like an ordinary break-in,
take whatever else you want.

134
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,546
Of course.

135
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:47,463
And should you be lucky enough
to find the artifact there,

136
00:11:47,589 --> 00:11:49,379
handle it with the utmost care.

137
00:11:49,505 --> 00:11:51,796
Have you considered my terms?

138
00:11:51,922 --> 00:11:56,047
Money's not a problem,
but the other business is more difficult.

139
00:11:57,756 --> 00:11:59,630
I'm afraid it's not negotiable.

140
00:11:59,756 --> 00:12:02,381
My client is using
what influence he has, but--

141
00:12:02,508 --> 00:12:04,172
But what?

142
00:12:04,298 --> 00:12:07,090
Reestablishing your position
in London society

143
00:12:07,216 --> 00:12:09,963
is proving more
troublesome than he thought.

144
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:12,381
The Granville Club
won't take you back,

145
00:12:12,507 --> 00:12:15,671
and most of the new businessmen
he spoke to want concrete references--

146
00:12:15,798 --> 00:12:17,589
introduction's no longer enough.

147
00:12:17,714 --> 00:12:19,546
Well, if anyone can do it,
Fludd can.

148
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:21,880
As I said, he's doing his best.

149
00:12:29,299 --> 00:12:31,796
If there's a slip-up,
I don't know you. Understand?

150
00:12:31,922 --> 00:12:33,754
Perfectly.

151
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:27,713
Penny for the guy, mister?

152
00:13:27,838 --> 00:13:30,630
It's September!

153
00:13:30,755 --> 00:13:33,129
Now get lost!
Ruddy pests!

154
00:13:34,672 --> 00:13:42,712
Penny for the guy!
Penny for the guy!

155
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:50,920
Where did you spring from?

156
00:13:55,797 --> 00:13:57,379
Come here.

157
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:01,046
Come on.

158
00:14:04,756 --> 00:14:06,087
Gotcha!

159
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,920
Not bad.

160
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,380
Wow!

161
00:14:39,506 --> 00:14:41,254
Whoa!

162
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,921
Oh...

163
00:14:47,171 --> 00:14:48,755
Oh!

164
00:15:09,463 --> 00:15:11,961
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

165
00:15:12,088 --> 00:15:15,087
- Isn't this what you wanted?
- You know it isn't.

166
00:15:15,213 --> 00:15:19,587
I changed my mind.
I told you I was doing this one alone.

167
00:15:19,712 --> 00:15:22,795
Yeah, but look.
We're in!

168
00:15:22,921 --> 00:15:24,920
Why didn't you tell us, Peter?

169
00:15:25,046 --> 00:15:28,629
- Because you wouldn't have done it.
- So you lied to us.

170
00:15:28,755 --> 00:15:31,670
I wanted to show Jimmy
what we were made of.

171
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:35,419
- He thought we were too young.
- I am too young.

172
00:15:35,545 --> 00:15:38,920
Fill your bags and wait by the door.

173
00:15:39,046 --> 00:15:41,378
Curly, keep an eye out the back.

174
00:15:42,587 --> 00:15:44,253
Nibs, watch the front.

175
00:15:57,005 --> 00:15:59,129
Sorry, Jimmy.

176
00:15:59,255 --> 00:16:01,712
I just wanted to show you
that I could do it.

177
00:16:01,838 --> 00:16:04,295
If you're going to be
my partner one day,

178
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:07,337
you must never
go behind my back.

179
00:16:07,462 --> 00:16:10,169
One day? But I'm ready now.

180
00:16:10,295 --> 00:16:14,086
Believe me, you've got
a lot of growing up to do first.

181
00:16:43,546 --> 00:16:47,503
Are you looking for
something in particular, Jimmy?

182
00:17:02,837 --> 00:17:05,835
I'll go and find something
to force it open.

183
00:17:49,419 --> 00:17:52,668
Whoa!

184
00:17:52,795 --> 00:17:54,794
Wha-What is it?

185
00:17:54,921 --> 00:17:58,128
Whoa!

186
00:18:16,252 --> 00:18:17,251
Not bad.

187
00:18:19,461 --> 00:18:20,752
Unh!

188
00:18:36,795 --> 00:18:38,336
It's all your fault, Peter.

189
00:18:38,461 --> 00:18:42,919
If you'd done as Jimmy said
and just--just left it alone...

190
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:50,501
...then they'd still be here.

191
00:18:52,668 --> 00:18:55,834
You were looking for this,
weren't you, Jimmy?

192
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,959
Who were you working for?

193
00:19:14,544 --> 00:19:17,542
- Where's Jimmy?
- He's out.

194
00:19:17,668 --> 00:19:19,251
When will he be back?

195
00:19:20,502 --> 00:19:22,960
What do you want him for?

196
00:19:23,087 --> 00:19:25,168
What do you want with Jimmy?

197
00:19:26,419 --> 00:19:28,001
Oi, come back!

198
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:48,417
Why do you follow Jeffries, boy?

199
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:56,375
- Jimmy didn't send you, did he?
- What do you want with Jimmy?

200
00:20:56,501 --> 00:21:00,083
That's my business.
Where is he?

201
00:21:03,502 --> 00:21:05,625
Just...gone.

202
00:21:05,751 --> 00:21:07,916
What do you mean, gone?

203
00:21:09,419 --> 00:21:10,752
A bomb in Harbottle's.

204
00:21:12,376 --> 00:21:15,792
- He found the orb, didn't he?
- You know what that thing is?

205
00:21:15,918 --> 00:21:18,084
So it was in Harbottle's after all.

206
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:21,500
- Jimmy was working for you?
- Where is it now

207
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,750
Tell me!

208
00:21:23,876 --> 00:21:26,334
It blew him up and all my crew.

209
00:21:27,585 --> 00:21:29,417
Let him go, Jeffries.

210
00:21:34,667 --> 00:21:36,416
They weren't blown up.

211
00:21:38,042 --> 00:21:39,374
Where are they, then?

212
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,792
Another world, more beautiful
than you can imagine.

213
00:21:42,917 --> 00:21:46,375
But I can get them back
if you tell me where the orb is.

214
00:21:46,502 --> 00:21:48,750
- How?
- It's a portal.

215
00:21:48,876 --> 00:21:51,250
A kind of door.

216
00:21:51,377 --> 00:21:54,625
And the slightest knock
will activate it.

217
00:21:54,751 --> 00:21:58,500
But we must hurry. Heavens, Jeffries, if I'd
have known it was at Harbottle's for sure,

218
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:00,624
I'd have engaged
someone more diligent--

219
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,750
- Hey!
- After him!

220
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,750
Hurry, Jeffries!

221
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,626
A door...

222
00:22:18,959 --> 00:22:21,124
to another world.

223
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,249
The slightest knock, eh?

224
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:31,249
Wha--What a weird-looking place.

225
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:35,875
But you're in there somewhere.

226
00:22:36,001 --> 00:22:37,334
Ain't ya, Jimmy?

227
00:22:39,043 --> 00:22:41,084
Open up, Peter!

228
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:42,833
We can help you!

229
00:22:42,959 --> 00:22:44,625
Help me?

230
00:22:44,751 --> 00:22:47,623
When has a toff ever helped
the likes of me?

231
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:57,166
I got him into this...

232
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:59,291
I'm gonna get him out.

233
00:23:31,167 --> 00:23:33,665
Hello?

234
00:23:35,416 --> 00:23:37,415
Where am I?

235
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:02,540
Come on, where are you?

236
00:24:07,167 --> 00:24:08,998
There you are.

237
00:24:15,999 --> 00:24:18,539
Lots of smoke...

238
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:20,623
but no flames.

239
00:24:22,499 --> 00:24:24,874
- Give me that.
- No!

240
00:24:27,416 --> 00:24:30,082
We've landed in hell, I tell you.

241
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:35,083
Soon, Lucifer's demons will rise up
to record our sins

242
00:24:35,209 --> 00:24:38,625
and throw us down there
into the everlasting fire of damnation,

243
00:24:38,751 --> 00:24:40,957
where we will burn in agony

244
00:24:41,084 --> 00:24:42,916
for all eternity.

245
00:24:50,248 --> 00:24:52,040
Jimmy!

246
00:24:52,166 --> 00:24:53,415
Fox!

247
00:24:54,958 --> 00:24:56,415
Hear that?

248
00:25:05,666 --> 00:25:07,373
They're headed this way.

249
00:25:08,582 --> 00:25:09,749
Kill the smoke.

250
00:25:16,415 --> 00:25:18,082
Hide! Quickly!

251
00:25:29,917 --> 00:25:33,705
Buongiorno, amico.
Got any goodies?

252
00:25:33,831 --> 00:25:35,456
-  Leave us alone!

253
00:25:35,581 --> 00:25:36,830
Let me go!

254
00:25:36,956 --> 00:25:38,414
- Go.
-  Just get off!

255
00:25:39,956 --> 00:25:42,664
Found another five little ones!

256
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,082
Get off me!

257
00:25:44,208 --> 00:25:46,956
- Get off!
- Let me go!

258
00:25:56,374 --> 00:25:58,081
Jimmy?

259
00:26:09,499 --> 00:26:11,164
Tootles.

260
00:26:32,665 --> 00:26:34,332
Pirates!

261
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,664
We're coming aboard!

262
00:26:38,791 --> 00:26:40,791
Going aboard!

263
00:27:06,706 --> 00:27:09,080
- Aaah!
- Aahh!

264
00:27:11,082 --> 00:27:12,330
Fox!

265
00:27:17,831 --> 00:27:19,330
Where did you spring from?

266
00:27:19,457 --> 00:27:21,955
You have no idea
how glad I am to see you.

267
00:27:22,082 --> 00:27:25,331
- Where the hell have we landed?
- I have no idea. All I know is...

268
00:27:25,456 --> 00:27:27,455
we're not in Shoreditch anymore.

269
00:27:27,581 --> 00:27:29,038
It was that thing...

270
00:27:29,164 --> 00:27:31,705
in Harbottle's, wasn't it?

271
00:27:33,705 --> 00:27:37,288
I'm sorry, Fox.
It's all my fault.

272
00:27:37,414 --> 00:27:40,289
We should never have broken
into Harbottle's in the first place.

273
00:27:40,415 --> 00:27:43,664
If Curly was here,
he'd string you up.

274
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:45,664
I'll make good.

275
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:48,747
I'll get them off that ship
and home safe.

276
00:27:48,872 --> 00:27:49,914
Ship?

277
00:27:51,498 --> 00:27:53,038
A pirate ship.

278
00:27:55,164 --> 00:27:56,788
It's a bloody nightmare.

279
00:27:56,914 --> 00:27:58,622
Weird crocs, spooky woods--

280
00:27:58,748 --> 00:28:00,205
now pirates!

281
00:28:00,331 --> 00:28:01,373
What's next?

282
00:28:01,498 --> 00:28:03,414
Swarms of flying beasties?

283
00:28:12,288 --> 00:28:13,954
What's that?

284
00:28:14,081 --> 00:28:16,578
Ohh, what now?

285
00:28:19,081 --> 00:28:20,498
Run!

286
00:28:39,706 --> 00:28:42,162
Get 'em off!

287
00:28:44,747 --> 00:28:46,913
On your feet!

288
00:28:53,413 --> 00:28:57,288
We've gotta stay ahead of the swarm,
otherwise we're dead!

289
00:29:30,412 --> 00:29:32,244
Injuns!

290
00:29:43,164 --> 00:29:45,038
What year do ya come from?

291
00:29:45,164 --> 00:29:46,579
1906.

292
00:29:46,705 --> 00:29:48,454
Ooh, that'll make me...

293
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:50,788
163 next October.

294
00:29:50,912 --> 00:29:53,329
263, you mean.

295
00:29:53,455 --> 00:29:56,162
Ooh, maybe I can start thinking
about settling down.

296
00:29:56,287 --> 00:29:58,620
Nice cottage on Venus.

297
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:03,788
From the 1700s.
Ho0s that possible?

298
00:30:03,914 --> 00:30:07,662
Cod liver oil, stewed prunes,
and regular trips up the rigging.

299
00:30:09,372 --> 00:30:11,912
Good for ya.

300
00:30:12,038 --> 00:30:15,579
And what are you good for,
I wonder?

301
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:25,120
It still works.

302
00:30:26,247 --> 00:30:28,454
Tick-tock.

303
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:31,079
Tick-tock, tick-tock.

304
00:30:31,205 --> 00:30:33,537
Tick-tock,
tick-tock.

305
00:30:33,663 --> 00:30:34,995
Tick-tock, tick-tock!

306
00:30:35,122 --> 00:30:37,995
Did you bring anything else
with you, did ya?

307
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,787
Oh, sugared almonds, perhaps?

308
00:30:42,954 --> 00:30:45,745
- Just what you see.
- Pity!

309
00:30:50,245 --> 00:30:51,953
How sweet.

310
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:54,995
He carries a picture
of his true love.

311
00:30:55,121 --> 00:30:57,287
What is this place?

312
00:30:57,413 --> 00:30:59,413
Can't you tell?

313
00:31:00,663 --> 00:31:02,702
It's heaven.

314
00:31:02,829 --> 00:31:04,370
Or hell!

315
00:31:06,954 --> 00:31:09,787
Depending on your point of view.

316
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:15,203
See? Lucifer's demons.

317
00:31:15,329 --> 00:31:17,787
What shall we do with them?
Hmm?

318
00:31:17,913 --> 00:31:19,704
Well, I want the English lads.

319
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:22,120
- What for?
- They look so tender.

320
00:31:22,246 --> 00:31:25,329
I bet they'd taste good
in a stew.

321
00:31:25,454 --> 00:31:28,119
My boys stay with me.

322
00:31:28,245 --> 00:31:31,411
He's a bold one, no?

323
00:31:31,536 --> 00:31:33,827
Well, he's not
a bad-looking wag.

324
00:31:33,954 --> 00:31:35,828
- Eh?
- Hmm.

325
00:31:35,954 --> 00:31:38,788
Maybe I could find a use for him
in my cabin.

326
00:31:38,913 --> 00:31:42,287
Good idea!
Maybe I need a rest.

327
00:31:42,413 --> 00:31:45,912
Just playing with you,
Starkey.

328
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:48,204
I'm just playing with ya.

329
00:31:48,329 --> 00:31:50,785
- Throw him to the crocs!
-

330
00:31:50,912 --> 00:31:53,203
Smee, you can keep the boys.

331
00:31:53,329 --> 00:31:56,786
Oh, thank you, ma'am.
You won't be sorry.

332
00:31:56,912 --> 00:31:59,453
I've got some coriander seeds
and some ginger saved.

333
00:31:59,578 --> 00:32:01,161
Aaah!

334
00:32:01,287 --> 00:32:04,577
Right. Now,
you'd better come with me.

335
00:32:04,703 --> 00:32:06,869
- You're not gonna like this next bit.
- Jimmy!

336
00:32:06,995 --> 00:32:08,745
Come on.

337
00:32:19,537 --> 00:32:21,661
Aaaah!

338
00:32:26,661 --> 00:32:28,870
My boys...

339
00:32:28,995 --> 00:32:31,911
stay with me.

340
00:32:54,496 --> 00:32:55,578
Wait.

341
00:32:55,704 --> 00:32:57,995
I want to watch.

342
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:27,910
You asked what I was good for. Well,
as you can see, I'm handy with a blade.

343
00:33:28,036 --> 00:33:29,452
Who are ya?

344
00:33:29,578 --> 00:33:31,328
My friends call me Jimmy.

345
00:33:32,745 --> 00:33:34,203
"Jimmy."

346
00:33:34,328 --> 00:33:35,952
But the name's Hook.

347
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:37,994
James Hook.

348
00:33:46,912 --> 00:33:48,701
I'm sorry for this, but...

349
00:33:48,827 --> 00:33:52,077
entrance to our village is secret.

350
00:34:08,244 --> 00:34:09,953
What are you gonna do with us?

351
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:11,203
Dinner.

352
00:34:11,329 --> 00:34:12,951
You're gonna eat us?!

353
00:34:13,078 --> 00:34:15,118
Why? Do you taste good?

354
00:34:15,244 --> 00:34:17,494
Come. You must be hungry.

355
00:34:38,911 --> 00:34:40,785
What's this meat?

356
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:42,493
Xaw.

357
00:34:46,243 --> 00:34:48,118
Are we in America?

358
00:34:48,244 --> 00:34:50,036
Not anymore.

359
00:34:50,162 --> 00:34:51,534
But you're Indians.

360
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:54,410
We are the Kaw,
people of the raven.

361
00:34:56,244 --> 00:34:58,284
We have become part
of this world now.

362
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,077
Do you know the way
back to London?

363
00:35:08,702 --> 00:35:09,701
The chief.

364
00:35:26,825 --> 00:35:29,452
Chasing tree spirits is hungry work.

365
00:35:37,202 --> 00:35:40,201
He asks if you want to join our tribe.

366
00:35:43,953 --> 00:35:46,950
Thank you, but, um, once we've
finished dinner we'll be on our way.

367
00:35:53,743 --> 00:35:54,992
We saved you before--

368
00:35:55,118 --> 00:35:58,450
we may not be there
to save you again.

369
00:35:58,577 --> 00:36:03,242
We're very grateful, but we have to
rescue our friends from pirates.

370
00:36:15,034 --> 00:36:16,035
Where are we?

371
00:36:16,161 --> 00:36:18,867
We call this Geih Gwaay.

372
00:36:18,993 --> 00:36:20,117
Neverland.

373
00:36:20,243 --> 00:36:21,242
Why?

374
00:36:21,368 --> 00:36:24,117
Because we never age here.

375
00:36:24,243 --> 00:36:28,201
You might not believe this,
but I am 130 years old.

376
00:36:29,076 --> 00:36:31,910
Innu's son is 81.

377
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:45,159
The chief's daughter.

378
00:36:47,161 --> 00:36:50,201
She is called Aaya K'aang.

379
00:36:50,327 --> 00:36:52,660
"Tiger Lily" in your language.

380
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:59,784
She is named this because she is
as wild as she is beautiful.

381
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:12,909
Don't get any ideas
because she is almost 100 years old.

382
00:37:21,908 --> 00:37:24,116
You've left me
with a bit of a problem.

383
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:27,408
Three of my best men dead.
One was my personal bodyguard.

384
00:37:27,534 --> 00:37:30,242
- It was self-defense.
- That's not the point.

385
00:37:31,326 --> 00:37:33,533
I can't get replacements here.

386
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:34,658
No?

387
00:37:34,785 --> 00:37:37,202
You're not in London now,
Hook.

388
00:37:37,327 --> 00:37:40,784
Do you notice anything
unusual out there?

389
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:42,493
I don't follow.

390
00:37:42,619 --> 00:37:43,949
Orion.

391
00:37:44,991 --> 00:37:46,783
Polaris.

392
00:37:47,909 --> 00:37:51,449
- Maybe you can point to the pole star.
- Astronomy's not my best suit.

393
00:37:51,575 --> 00:37:55,116
Well, if it was, you'd notice
that there isn't a pole star.

394
00:37:55,242 --> 00:37:57,657
And Orion is over there--

395
00:37:59,033 --> 00:38:02,075
in the wrong place.

396
00:38:03,659 --> 00:38:05,201
Ho0s that possible?

397
00:38:05,327 --> 00:38:10,116
Planet earth is in a different galaxy...

398
00:38:10,242 --> 00:38:13,033
far, far away.

399
00:38:13,159 --> 00:38:15,116
There's no way back.

400
00:38:15,241 --> 00:38:16,783
Are you sure?

401
00:38:16,909 --> 00:38:20,283
I've had almost 200 years

402
00:38:20,409 --> 00:38:22,449
to work it out.

403
00:38:34,408 --> 00:38:37,365
We've gotta fatten you up,
and no mistake.

404
00:38:38,283 --> 00:38:40,032
Any bread and jam?

405
00:38:40,158 --> 00:38:42,784
Hmm. I've got cream cakes,

406
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:45,241
sÂ¤eetmeats, pickled herring,

407
00:38:45,368 --> 00:38:47,533
and crystallized dates.

408
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:51,825
But sadly, no bread and jam,
your highness.

409
00:38:53,743 --> 00:38:57,366
We're stuck here,
but it needn't be all bad.

410
00:38:57,492 --> 00:38:59,657
This planet has something...

411
00:39:01,283 --> 00:39:03,282
special to offer.

412
00:39:04,409 --> 00:39:08,449
It's mined by creatures of this world.

413
00:39:08,575 --> 00:39:12,116
The Indians call them tree spirits.

414
00:39:12,241 --> 00:39:16,282
This...is the stuff
that makes them fly.

415
00:39:21,325 --> 00:39:22,616
Indians?

416
00:39:22,742 --> 00:39:25,532
We're not the only ones
from our world, Hook.

417
00:39:25,657 --> 00:39:29,075
A year ago I captured one of them.

418
00:39:31,326 --> 00:39:34,450
He was carrying this mineral,

419
00:39:34,575 --> 00:39:38,033
and under torture,
he told me of its power.

420
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:42,281
It'll make you feel more alive,

421
00:39:42,407 --> 00:39:44,698
more complete,
than you've ever felt--

422
00:39:44,824 --> 00:39:46,949
it'll light you up from inside.

423
00:39:48,492 --> 00:39:51,407
Literally turn you into...

424
00:39:52,657 --> 00:39:54,448
a god.

425
00:40:01,118 --> 00:40:04,408
And give you the power...

426
00:40:05,824 --> 00:40:06,823
to fly.

427
00:40:06,948 --> 00:40:08,449
Incredible.

428
00:40:13,574 --> 00:40:16,323
As you can see, it's unstable.

429
00:40:16,449 --> 00:40:18,823
But that's only because
I don't know how to use it yet.

430
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:21,865
Besides, I only have enough
for this magic trick.

431
00:40:21,991 --> 00:40:24,865
We need more, lots more.

432
00:40:24,991 --> 00:40:28,449
The only problem is,
we can't get near the tree spirits.

433
00:40:28,575 --> 00:40:31,906
They're protected
by the Kaw mountains on one side

434
00:40:32,032 --> 00:40:34,156
and the savages on the other.

435
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,031
Join me, Hook.

436
00:40:39,533 --> 00:40:42,282
I badly need fresh blood,
and you bring knowledge

437
00:40:42,408 --> 00:40:44,782
from a modern world.

438
00:40:44,908 --> 00:40:48,616
You help me defeat the savages,

439
00:40:48,742 --> 00:40:53,823
and together we can rule
Neverland like gods...

440
00:40:53,948 --> 00:40:55,531
and turn this endless purgatory

441
00:40:55,657 --> 00:40:59,156
into an eternal paradise.

442
00:41:03,948 --> 00:41:05,573
Gods?

443
00:41:08,158 --> 00:41:09,906
Yes...

444
00:41:10,032 --> 00:41:11,907
gods.

445
00:41:28,075 --> 00:41:30,406
What are you doing up here,
Starkey?

446
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:36,531
Don't the captain need you tonight?

447
00:41:36,657 --> 00:41:38,199
Leave me alone!

448
00:41:42,573 --> 00:41:45,571
Oh, dear.

449
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:57,529
There must be a way down.

450
00:43:04,782 --> 00:43:07,322
We will build you
and your friend a hut.

451
00:43:07,448 --> 00:43:09,280
Thank you.

452
00:43:09,406 --> 00:43:11,156
Why live up here?

453
00:43:11,282 --> 00:43:13,322
To be near the tree spirits.

454
00:43:13,448 --> 00:43:15,403
That is their city.

455
00:43:16,573 --> 00:43:19,281
We protect them from the pirates.

456
00:43:21,239 --> 00:43:23,989
How do you get down to the sea
from here?

457
00:43:24,115 --> 00:43:26,614
The same way you were brought in,

458
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:30,654
through a secret passage
through those mountains.

459
00:43:31,739 --> 00:43:33,447
Will you show me?

460
00:43:33,572 --> 00:43:37,280
If you try to rescue your friends,
the pirates will capture and torture you

461
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:41,155
until you show them
the mountain passage.

462
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,905
But I can't just sit on my hands.
I'm the one that got them into this mess,

463
00:43:45,031 --> 00:43:47,988
I've got to find a way
to get them home and safe.

464
00:43:48,114 --> 00:43:49,904
There is no way home.

465
00:43:52,114 --> 00:43:53,112
What?

466
00:43:58,865 --> 00:43:59,989
No.

467
00:44:02,406 --> 00:44:04,696
There is a way back.

468
00:44:04,822 --> 00:44:06,905
There must be.

469
00:44:15,614 --> 00:44:17,238
Fox!

470
00:44:28,322 --> 00:44:29,696
Fox, I have a plan.

471
00:44:29,821 --> 00:44:31,238
- For what?
- To get us out of here

472
00:44:31,364 --> 00:44:32,779
and onto that ship.

473
00:44:32,904 --> 00:44:34,405
Come on.

474
00:44:36,031 --> 00:44:38,780
See what they're carrying?
Fishing nets.

475
00:44:39,698 --> 00:44:40,946
So?

476
00:44:41,072 --> 00:44:43,696
Have you seen any fishing
waters around here?

477
00:44:43,822 --> 00:44:45,237
No.

478
00:44:45,364 --> 00:44:46,780
Exactly.

479
00:44:46,906 --> 00:44:48,530
I don't understand.

480
00:44:48,656 --> 00:44:51,987
That's how we're gonna find
the secret passage through the mountains.

481
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,987
Come on.

482
00:46:28,404 --> 00:46:32,153
My God!
Look at the size of it!

483
00:46:40,739 --> 00:46:43,279
Grab on to that.
Quick, grab on to it.

484
00:46:43,405 --> 00:46:45,820
Shh! Quiet.

485
00:46:59,237 --> 00:47:01,154
Do you see Jimmy?

486
00:47:01,279 --> 00:47:04,028
No. How are we gonna
get 'em out, Peter?

487
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:06,445
They're surrounded by pirates.

488
00:47:06,571 --> 00:47:09,736
Yeah, but sleeping pirates.

489
00:47:09,863 --> 00:47:12,652
Drunk, sleeping pirates.

490
00:47:30,237 --> 00:47:32,653
Peter, you're here!

491
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:34,111
Peter!

492
00:47:34,236 --> 00:47:35,778
Shh. Shh.

493
00:47:35,904 --> 00:47:37,611
Come on.

494
00:47:37,737 --> 00:47:39,777
I'm not going anywhere with you.

495
00:47:39,903 --> 00:47:43,361
- Shut it, Curly. He's here to help.
- Yeah, well, we don't need his help.

496
00:47:43,487 --> 00:47:46,527
Yeah, he's the one who got us
into this mess in the first place.

497
00:47:46,653 --> 00:47:48,736
Well, I'm the one
that's getting you out.

498
00:47:48,863 --> 00:47:50,695
You want to stay, fine.

499
00:47:50,821 --> 00:47:53,944
You want to live,
follow us.

500
00:47:54,071 --> 00:47:57,279
Did I ever tell you
my recipe for turtle soup?

501
00:47:57,405 --> 00:47:59,903
Please, Smee.

502
00:48:00,779 --> 00:48:02,153
Shh!

503
00:48:03,528 --> 00:48:04,945
Hey...

504
00:48:11,403 --> 00:48:12,861
Something, she is not right.

505
00:48:12,987 --> 00:48:14,486
What?

506
00:48:15,488 --> 00:48:16,944
I'm going to go look around.

507
00:48:17,071 --> 00:48:21,485
I wouldn't do that if I was you,
not up there in Bonny's cabin.

508
00:48:21,612 --> 00:48:22,777
Thank you.

509
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:29,445
Where's Jimmy?

510
00:48:29,570 --> 00:48:31,945
The captain's quarters.

511
00:48:32,072 --> 00:48:35,111
- Are you sure?
- She's got a shine for him.

512
00:48:35,237 --> 00:48:36,944
"She"?

513
00:48:38,196 --> 00:48:40,612
- Where you goin', Peter?
- To get Jimmy.

514
00:48:40,738 --> 00:48:44,361
But we're all here. We can
make a clean getaway if we go now.

515
00:48:44,488 --> 00:48:46,361
I'm not going without Jimmy.

516
00:49:21,570 --> 00:49:22,986
Where's Jimmy?

517
00:49:23,112 --> 00:49:25,735
Peter! How did you get here?

518
00:49:27,028 --> 00:49:29,111
Get your clothes on.
I've got a canoe waiting below.

519
00:49:29,237 --> 00:49:30,860
Put the pistol down, Peter.
Bonny's a friend.

520
00:49:30,986 --> 00:49:32,610
- Bonny?
- How many more in your litter, Hook?

521
00:49:32,736 --> 00:49:35,777
Let me speak to him.
I didn't know he was here.

522
00:49:35,903 --> 00:49:38,276
- Give me the gun, Peter.
-

523
00:49:38,402 --> 00:49:40,360
-  Wait, Starkey.
- Peter, give me the gun!

524
00:49:40,486 --> 00:49:42,276
Tell him to put his away first!

525
00:49:42,402 --> 00:49:45,152
Listen to me, Peter.
Captain Bonny and her men are on our side.

526
00:49:45,278 --> 00:49:48,152
She's assured me that
the boys will be well looked after.

527
00:49:48,278 --> 00:49:49,486
The Indians say they're crazy.

528
00:49:49,612 --> 00:49:51,153
- Indians?
- He's with the savages.

529
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:53,361
Trust me, Peter,
they're anything but crazy.

530
00:49:53,487 --> 00:49:56,318
These are our people. It's a dangerous
place, they can help us survive.

531
00:49:56,444 --> 00:49:59,360
- Do you want to stay here? With her?
- We've nowhere else to go.

532
00:49:59,486 --> 00:50:01,693
We can stay with the Indians
until we find a way home.

533
00:50:01,819 --> 00:50:04,194
- They'll scalp and skin the lot of ya.
- No, they won't! They're good people!

534
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:06,110
- How do you know?
- They're kind!

535
00:50:06,236 --> 00:50:08,110
Listen to me, Peter.

536
00:50:08,236 --> 00:50:11,027
I'm staying here.

537
00:50:12,403 --> 00:50:14,943
If you want to stick with me,

538
00:50:15,070 --> 00:50:17,234
give me the gun.

539
00:50:22,485 --> 00:50:24,401
I don't trust them, Jimmy.

540
00:50:26,445 --> 00:50:28,443
So trust me.

541
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:37,777
Give me the gun.

542
00:50:52,444 --> 00:50:54,610
Come on!

543
00:50:54,735 --> 00:50:56,568
Leave him be.

544
00:50:58,069 --> 00:50:59,650
Hook!

545
00:50:59,777 --> 00:51:01,901
Leave it.

546
00:51:09,069 --> 00:51:12,400
You little rat!
You... piccolo ratto!

547
00:51:13,444 --> 00:51:16,609
Your boys are gone, Smee.
But I captured this one.

548
00:51:16,735 --> 00:51:18,150
He's not one of my boys!

549
00:51:18,276 --> 00:51:20,651
Hook - he had him working
behind our backs.

550
00:51:20,777 --> 00:51:22,485
What did you do with my boys?!

551
00:51:22,610 --> 00:51:25,485
Leave him be! He's just a boy!
He doesn't know what he's doing.

552
00:51:25,611 --> 00:51:29,193
I'm gonna keelhaul him if he don't tell me
what he's done with my boys!

553
00:51:32,526 --> 00:51:35,400
Where are the others, Peter? Hm?

554
00:51:35,526 --> 00:51:37,776
We must all stick together.

555
00:51:37,902 --> 00:51:41,317
Not here.
Not with these crazies.

556
00:51:41,443 --> 00:51:42,859
Shh shh shh.

557
00:51:42,985 --> 00:51:44,735
You're safe with me.

558
00:51:46,736 --> 00:51:50,860
Now let's go inside, get something to eat
and forget this foolishness.

559
00:51:50,986 --> 00:51:51,985
Hmm?

560
00:51:58,525 --> 00:51:59,608
Peter!

561
00:51:59,734 --> 00:52:01,068
Get back here!

562
00:52:01,194 --> 00:52:02,984
Come back here!

563
00:52:03,110 --> 00:52:04,901
Aaaah!

564
00:52:10,277 --> 00:52:12,610
Unhand me!

565
00:52:12,736 --> 00:52:14,734
Where is he?

566
00:52:17,901 --> 00:52:19,192
Where are you?

567
00:52:22,651 --> 00:52:23,692
Aha!

568
00:52:29,485 --> 00:52:30,525
Fox!

569
00:52:32,234 --> 00:52:34,192
Run! Run, Fox!

570
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:36,859
There!

571
00:52:36,985 --> 00:52:39,484
Quick! Quick, hurry!
Come on, come on!

572
00:52:39,610 --> 00:52:41,567
Quick!

573
00:52:44,109 --> 00:52:45,567
Row faster!

574
00:52:46,734 --> 00:52:48,441
Quickly! Quickly! Faster!

575
00:52:48,567 --> 00:52:50,649
Quickly!

576
00:52:50,776 --> 00:52:52,650
Peter!

577
00:52:52,777 --> 00:52:54,941
- Over here, Peter!
- Come on!

578
00:52:55,067 --> 00:52:57,941
- Come on! Let's go!
- But Fox is up there!

579
00:52:58,068 --> 00:53:00,067
He came back for you.

580
00:53:03,027 --> 00:53:04,817
-  Jump!

581
00:53:04,942 --> 00:53:07,484
Jump! If you jump now,
you'll make the canoe.

582
00:53:07,610 --> 00:53:09,317
Jump, Fox!

583
00:53:11,984 --> 00:53:13,317
Unhh!

584
00:53:14,776 --> 00:53:16,649
Fox.

585
00:53:25,401 --> 00:53:27,150
Fox!

586
00:53:30,484 --> 00:53:39,317
Peter!

587
00:53:43,443 --> 00:53:44,983
Peter...

588
00:53:53,233 --> 00:53:56,815
We trusted you,
gave you the freedom of our village.

589
00:53:56,941 --> 00:53:58,816
And you abused that trust.

590
00:54:02,901 --> 00:54:04,192
Stole two canoes

591
00:54:04,318 --> 00:54:08,275
and used the mountain passage
without our consent.

592
00:54:11,068 --> 00:54:12,609
I should punish you,

593
00:54:12,734 --> 00:54:14,983
but in light of your loss,

594
00:54:15,109 --> 00:54:17,899
I will be lenient this time.

595
00:54:39,775 --> 00:54:41,607
I want to find them.

596
00:54:45,733 --> 00:54:49,982
Things have come a long way
since I terrorized the Spanish Main.

597
00:54:55,067 --> 00:54:56,774
What else is new?

598
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:58,691
Flying machines?

599
00:54:58,817 --> 00:55:01,317
Where is this Indian settlement?

600
00:55:04,566 --> 00:55:07,106
You would choose the boys over me?

601
00:55:07,233 --> 00:55:09,775
I'm responsible for them,
I brought them here.

602
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:12,607
- They look up to me.
- What will you do when you find them?

603
00:55:12,733 --> 00:55:15,857
They're clever.
Trained in the streets, pickpockets.

604
00:55:15,983 --> 00:55:19,399
They could be useful to us,
help us find the mineral dust.

605
00:55:19,525 --> 00:55:21,317
"Us"?

606
00:55:29,858 --> 00:55:32,732
I've never met anyone like you.

607
00:55:36,899 --> 00:55:39,149
And what about her?

608
00:55:40,941 --> 00:55:43,649
You forgotten already?

609
00:55:43,776 --> 00:55:45,816
She passed away many years ago.

610
00:55:45,941 --> 00:55:48,399
But you still carry her portrait.

611
00:55:48,525 --> 00:55:50,523
She had hold of me once.

612
00:55:56,274 --> 00:55:58,272
Now I have you.

613
00:56:06,484 --> 00:56:09,565
I'll give you what you want,
Hook,

614
00:56:09,690 --> 00:56:12,358
but only if you give me what I want.

615
00:56:12,484 --> 00:56:15,606
There is no "us."

616
00:56:15,733 --> 00:56:17,315
Understand?

617
00:56:19,232 --> 00:56:23,607
I'll let you live because
I want to know what you know--

618
00:56:23,733 --> 00:56:27,315
all 200 years of it.

619
00:56:32,566 --> 00:56:34,774
You lied to us.

620
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:37,065
We never should have
broken into Harbottle's.

621
00:56:37,191 --> 00:56:40,189
- You were just showing off to Jimmy.
- And now we're stuck here.

622
00:56:40,315 --> 00:56:42,439
- Wherever "here" is.
- And you got Fox killed.

623
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:45,315
- Curly!
- We were all in that canoe.

624
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:49,439
All right? We could have all got away,
but he had to go back for Jimmy.

625
00:56:50,441 --> 00:56:53,315
What's the point of rubbing it in?

626
00:56:56,775 --> 00:56:58,733
Curly's right.

627
00:57:00,025 --> 00:57:02,023
I got Fox killed.

628
00:57:39,899 --> 00:57:42,106
No, no, no, no.

629
00:57:42,232 --> 00:57:44,190
It should go...

630
00:57:47,733 --> 00:57:50,189
At the end, up, not down.

631
00:57:50,315 --> 00:57:52,356
You know this tune?

632
00:57:53,857 --> 00:57:55,230
Come.

633
00:57:57,522 --> 00:57:59,273
Where did you see this?

634
00:57:59,398 --> 00:58:01,106
In here.

635
00:58:01,231 --> 00:58:02,481
A dream.

636
00:58:02,607 --> 00:58:05,273
The same dream every night.

637
00:58:05,398 --> 00:58:07,147
You have the dream too,
don't you?

638
00:58:07,273 --> 00:58:08,938
Uh-huh.

639
00:58:09,065 --> 00:58:12,771
That music, it's the sound
of tree spirit wings.

640
00:58:12,897 --> 00:58:15,898
He's holding the orb,
isn't he?

641
00:58:16,023 --> 00:58:17,730
That isn't quite right.

642
00:58:17,857 --> 00:58:20,857
The peaks were different in my dream.

643
00:58:26,648 --> 00:58:27,814
Draw it.

644
00:58:44,648 --> 00:58:46,646
It's something like--

645
00:58:49,981 --> 00:58:51,313
No.

646
00:58:51,439 --> 00:58:53,231
Can I try?

647
00:59:02,564 --> 00:59:04,646
Something like this?

648
00:59:07,189 --> 00:59:08,606
Do you have the dream too?

649
00:59:08,731 --> 00:59:12,105
No. But I hunt and fish.

650
00:59:12,231 --> 00:59:14,606
We call that Bull Mountain.

651
00:59:14,731 --> 00:59:18,438
We've never been there.
It's too far away.

652
00:59:18,564 --> 00:59:21,147
But we can see it on a clear day

653
00:59:21,273 --> 00:59:23,730
when we pass the outer islands.

654
00:59:25,564 --> 00:59:28,188
So the hooded man was in Neverland.

655
00:59:28,314 --> 00:59:31,980
- Why do we have the same dream?
- How did you get to Neverland?

656
00:59:32,106 --> 00:59:35,897
- I hit the orb with my dagger.
- Me too, with the staff.

657
00:59:36,023 --> 00:59:39,481
I hit it so hard I brought
the whole tribe with me.

658
00:59:41,231 --> 00:59:44,522
Perhaps part of its great power

659
00:59:44,648 --> 00:59:46,480
enters those who strike it.

660
00:59:46,606 --> 00:59:48,813
Do you think the hooded man
is still there?

661
00:59:54,731 --> 00:59:56,313
How do I get to this island?

662
01:00:08,522 --> 01:00:12,063
- I'm coming with you.
- No, Toots. It's too dangerous.

663
01:00:12,189 --> 01:00:13,480
I don't care.

664
01:00:13,605 --> 01:00:15,813
But I do.
I've done enough damage.

665
01:00:15,939 --> 01:00:19,813
Look, it's just a dream. It'll probably turn out
to be a wild-goose chase,

666
01:00:19,939 --> 01:00:24,438
but if I do find a way home,
I'll be back for you and the others, okay?

667
01:00:24,564 --> 01:00:26,772
What do I tell them?

668
01:00:26,898 --> 01:00:28,897
To sit tight and wait for me.

669
01:00:29,024 --> 01:00:32,563
And that I promise I'll do everything I can
to get them home safe.

670
01:00:34,439 --> 01:00:37,104
We'll find
the mineral dust here,

671
01:00:37,230 --> 01:00:39,645
in the tree spirit colony.

672
01:00:39,772 --> 01:00:43,270
But the problem is,
it's within the Kaw territory.

673
01:00:43,396 --> 01:00:47,063
The mountains from the north
to the east are impregnable,

674
01:00:47,189 --> 01:00:49,271
and tall cliffs line the Kaw.

675
01:00:49,397 --> 01:00:51,397
So there's no way through.

676
01:00:55,065 --> 01:00:58,480
- How do the Indians get in and out?
- We don't know.

677
01:00:58,605 --> 01:01:02,395
We can watch them cook on their campfires
from across a narrow ravine,

678
01:01:02,521 --> 01:01:04,021
but if we try to rope across

679
01:01:04,146 --> 01:01:07,771
they will pick us off
like gulls on a gaff rig.

680
01:01:07,897 --> 01:01:10,938
They hunt on this part of the island,

681
01:01:11,064 --> 01:01:13,438
going back and forth
as if these mountains

682
01:01:13,564 --> 01:01:15,479
weren't even there.

683
01:01:17,731 --> 01:01:19,563
Any ideas?

684
01:01:23,645 --> 01:01:27,228
Perhaps we should watch them
a little more closely.

685
01:01:54,563 --> 01:01:57,603
The chief's daughter
is a prize indeed.

686
01:01:57,729 --> 01:02:00,438
She'll tell us how to get into
the tree spirit colony.

687
01:02:00,564 --> 01:02:02,271
I'll send some men to cut them off.

688
01:02:02,396 --> 01:02:04,936
No. Sometimes smaller is smarter.

689
01:02:05,064 --> 01:02:08,562
They're up to something.
LÂ¤t's find out what first.

690
01:02:17,563 --> 01:02:20,605
He was standing on a hill
in front of the mountain.

691
01:02:20,730 --> 01:02:22,937
There must be
a hundred hills here.

692
01:02:23,064 --> 01:02:25,063
Let's try that one.

693
01:02:35,479 --> 01:02:36,978
I find it!

694
01:02:39,396 --> 01:02:41,562
The prints go this way.

695
01:02:43,978 --> 01:02:46,394
Right, then. Let's go.

696
01:02:56,312 --> 01:02:59,270
Aaya) Your family back home
must be very worried about you.

697
01:02:59,395 --> 01:03:00,811
I don't have a family.

698
01:03:00,936 --> 01:03:04,436
My mother died when I was three
and I never knew my father.

699
01:03:04,562 --> 01:03:06,436
So I was brought up in a workhouse.

700
01:03:06,562 --> 01:03:09,187
Is that where you met your friends?

701
01:03:09,313 --> 01:03:10,895
Nah.

702
01:03:11,021 --> 01:03:12,770
No, I was the only kid there.

703
01:03:12,896 --> 01:03:14,478
"Punchbag", they called me.

704
01:03:14,604 --> 01:03:16,270
Jimmy fished me out.
He was visiting one day

705
01:03:16,396 --> 01:03:18,811
and saw me getting a kicking.

706
01:03:18,937 --> 01:03:21,102
He was a good man once.

707
01:03:21,228 --> 01:03:23,478
The best.

708
01:03:23,604 --> 01:03:25,394
He saved my life, but...

709
01:03:26,771 --> 01:03:28,895
that pirate turned his head.

710
01:03:36,063 --> 01:03:38,354
Recognize anything?

711
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:41,228
It wasn't as overgrown
in my dream.

712
01:03:42,229 --> 01:03:44,144
Let's find a place to rest.

713
01:03:44,270 --> 01:03:45,895
It'll be dark soon.

714
01:05:22,810 --> 01:05:24,102
Wait!

715
01:05:26,187 --> 01:05:27,894
It's the tree spirit from my dream!

716
01:05:34,228 --> 01:05:36,560
Come on! She might lead us
to the hooded man!

717
01:05:45,062 --> 01:05:46,100
See her?

718
01:05:47,394 --> 01:05:50,434
- No.
- She's too fast.

719
01:05:52,227 --> 01:05:55,727
I've never seen
a tree spirit glow like that.

720
01:05:56,894 --> 01:05:58,393
She's really beautiful.

721
01:06:01,561 --> 01:06:02,728
Oh, no.

722
01:06:02,854 --> 01:06:04,561
What?

723
01:06:04,687 --> 01:06:06,851
The sun's coming up.

724
01:06:06,977 --> 01:06:09,018
Now we're never gonna find her.

725
01:06:29,727 --> 01:06:32,976
I've never seen anything like this.

726
01:06:38,061 --> 01:06:41,770
We've got to find a way in.
He must be in there.

727
01:06:47,895 --> 01:06:50,102
How are you at climbing?

728
01:06:50,227 --> 01:06:52,310
It's a mile high.

729
01:06:53,435 --> 01:06:55,226
Then we better get started.

730
01:07:16,810 --> 01:07:18,184
It's incredible.

731
01:07:18,310 --> 01:07:20,435
Do you see anyone
down there?

732
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:21,934
No.

733
01:07:22,061 --> 01:07:25,518
Come on. Down is sometimes
harder than up.

734
01:07:59,895 --> 01:08:01,518
Where is everyone?

735
01:08:02,643 --> 01:08:04,976
They'll come to us.

736
01:08:05,101 --> 01:08:07,143
How do you know?

737
01:08:07,268 --> 01:08:11,100
Anyone clever enough
to make all this

738
01:08:11,226 --> 01:08:13,809
already knows we're here.

739
01:08:13,935 --> 01:08:16,143
That's right.

740
01:08:21,851 --> 01:08:24,601
You. You're the hooded man!

741
01:08:24,727 --> 01:08:27,141
Hello, Peter.

742
01:08:27,267 --> 01:08:28,433
Can you get us home?

743
01:08:28,559 --> 01:08:30,641
Of course.
Now that I'm here,

744
01:08:30,768 --> 01:08:33,100
everything shall find its proper place.

745
01:08:33,226 --> 01:08:35,350
You have the orb?

746
01:08:35,476 --> 01:08:37,433
In a manner of speaking.

747
01:08:38,769 --> 01:08:40,435
Hmm?

748
01:08:46,393 --> 01:08:49,434
Finally, after almost 350 years,

749
01:08:49,561 --> 01:08:51,808
it's back where it belongs.

750
01:08:51,934 --> 01:08:56,475
Now we can start to bring
the elite of our world here to my utopia.

751
01:08:56,601 --> 01:08:58,309
So how will you get us back?

752
01:08:58,435 --> 01:09:00,142
Patience, young friend.

753
01:09:00,267 --> 01:09:03,267
- You made all this?
- Mm-hm.

754
01:09:03,393 --> 01:09:05,559
It's easier than it looks.

755
01:09:05,685 --> 01:09:09,892
A simple growth solution
which compels the forest to grow...

756
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:14,224
in the way that I want it to grow.

757
01:09:15,601 --> 01:09:18,184
- Who are you?
- My apologies.

758
01:09:18,310 --> 01:09:20,351
My name is Dr. Richard Fludd.

759
01:09:20,477 --> 01:09:24,099
Alchemist to Her Majesty
Queen Elizabeth the First.

760
01:09:25,352 --> 01:09:26,684
What?

761
01:09:27,643 --> 01:09:29,184
Hard to believe, I know,

762
01:09:29,310 --> 01:09:32,641
but I am almost 400 years old.

763
01:09:34,643 --> 01:09:37,267
Come, I'll show you my life's work.

764
01:09:49,224 --> 01:09:51,807
It's only a few hours old.

765
01:10:06,808 --> 01:10:11,766
I was engaged in the search
for the philosopher's stone,

766
01:10:11,892 --> 01:10:16,807
the elixir believed to grant
everlasting life.

767
01:10:19,850 --> 01:10:21,891
There were others like me,
of course,

768
01:10:22,017 --> 01:10:24,350
but they were all trying
to make a tangible substance

769
01:10:24,476 --> 01:10:28,474
which could be
consumed in some way.

770
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:30,599
What I discovered was that

771
01:10:30,724 --> 01:10:33,974
the philosopher's stone
cannot be made--

772
01:10:34,099 --> 01:10:36,099
it has to be trapped.

773
01:10:43,226 --> 01:10:45,100
You see, it's a form of cosmic energy

774
01:10:45,226 --> 01:10:48,556
which lives at the very
center of the universe...

775
01:10:50,558 --> 01:10:52,807
where its four corners meet.

776
01:10:54,725 --> 01:10:56,932
This is the shape

777
01:10:57,058 --> 01:10:59,057
of the universe.

778
01:11:04,891 --> 01:11:06,766
And here...

779
01:11:06,892 --> 01:11:08,891
at its center...

780
01:11:10,475 --> 01:11:12,349
is this tiny planet.

781
01:11:15,309 --> 01:11:18,223
- Neverland.
- Mmm.

782
01:11:19,225 --> 01:11:21,016
And because it lives at the farthest

783
01:11:21,142 --> 01:11:24,600
reaches of the universe,
as well as at its center,

784
01:11:24,726 --> 01:11:28,807
time stands still
for all those who come here.

785
01:11:33,517 --> 01:11:35,224
So how do we get back?

786
01:11:36,058 --> 01:11:37,556
Ah.

787
01:11:43,724 --> 01:11:46,806
When I first arrived on this planet,
I was stuck here,

788
01:11:46,932 --> 01:11:50,931
because, of course, the orb
that I'd made in London remained there.

789
01:11:51,058 --> 01:11:54,682
But as you know,
the harder you strike the orb,

790
01:11:54,808 --> 01:11:56,640
the more it...

791
01:11:56,767 --> 01:11:59,598
So thankfully, most of
the contents of my laboratory

792
01:11:59,725 --> 01:12:02,223
traveled with me, and in time,

793
01:12:02,350 --> 01:12:05,057
I was able to build a twin.

794
01:12:06,724 --> 01:12:11,849
I activated it here in Neverland
with the power from two meteors.

795
01:12:13,807 --> 01:12:15,931
It's just like the other one.

796
01:12:24,807 --> 01:12:27,806
I call her Tinker Bell...

797
01:12:27,932 --> 01:12:32,390
because of the beautiful sound
her wings make through the air.

798
01:12:35,932 --> 01:12:40,349
When she saw me harnessing
the astral energy of two meteors,

799
01:12:40,475 --> 01:12:44,098
she thought I was in trouble
and tried to save me.

800
01:12:46,224 --> 01:12:47,680
That's my dream.

801
01:12:47,806 --> 01:12:50,265
All who activate the orb

802
01:12:50,391 --> 01:12:52,514
are imprinted with that memory.

803
01:12:55,766 --> 01:12:58,638
Why does she glow so bright?

804
01:12:58,765 --> 01:13:02,223
Well, much of that astral energy
is trapped inside her.

805
01:13:04,059 --> 01:13:05,431
Hmm.

806
01:13:08,224 --> 01:13:09,639
Come.

807
01:13:19,766 --> 01:13:21,057
We'll take the orb below.

808
01:13:21,183 --> 01:13:23,640
There's an open area
where I can send you both back.

809
01:13:23,766 --> 01:13:27,140
No. Not yet.
I've got to find my friends.

810
01:13:30,682 --> 01:13:32,931
Seems I have more guests.

811
01:13:41,973 --> 01:13:44,181
Incredible.

812
01:13:44,307 --> 01:13:46,348
What's it all for?

813
01:13:47,307 --> 01:13:49,514
Mi sento il diavolo.

814
01:13:49,639 --> 01:13:52,057
Attenzione.

815
01:13:52,183 --> 01:13:55,181
There could be demons lurking
behind these walls.

816
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:59,180
No. Only me.

817
01:14:06,223 --> 01:14:07,972
That's the man in my dream.

818
01:14:13,515 --> 01:14:14,889
Fludd.

819
01:14:16,265 --> 01:14:18,389
You know him?

820
01:14:30,307 --> 01:14:31,723
Dr. Fludd.

821
01:14:45,264 --> 01:14:46,597
Where's Peter?

822
01:14:46,723 --> 01:14:48,637
Please lay down your weapons.

823
01:14:48,764 --> 01:14:51,222
This is a sanctuary.
You're in no danger here.

824
01:14:51,349 --> 01:14:53,764
Why such a big city
forjust one man?

825
01:14:53,889 --> 01:14:57,263
It will soon be filled
with the elite of our world--

826
01:14:57,389 --> 01:14:59,764
artists, statesmen, philosophers.

827
01:14:59,890 --> 01:15:01,096
What the hell for?

828
01:15:01,222 --> 01:15:05,015
Think what great minds can achieve
if they have the rest of eternity to study.

829
01:15:05,140 --> 01:15:07,847
- Can you help us get back to London?
- Yes.

830
01:15:07,973 --> 01:15:10,056
Did you send Peter back already?

831
01:15:10,182 --> 01:15:11,596
Not yet.

832
01:15:11,723 --> 01:15:12,972
Then where is he?

833
01:15:13,098 --> 01:15:15,430
As I said, this is a sanctuary.

834
01:15:15,556 --> 01:15:18,680
All who enter here
are granted my protection.

835
01:15:18,806 --> 01:15:22,348
If you lay down your weapons,
I can start to prepare your return.

836
01:15:22,474 --> 01:15:24,473
I don't want to go back.

837
01:15:30,890 --> 01:15:32,554
No?

838
01:15:34,388 --> 01:15:37,554
Who wants to return
to the Caribbean?

839
01:15:39,556 --> 01:15:43,179
Do you think we'd still strike terror
into men's hearts?

840
01:15:44,556 --> 01:15:45,971
Tell them, Hook.

841
01:15:46,097 --> 01:15:48,555
Tell them how it's changed.

842
01:15:49,890 --> 01:15:51,805
We wouldn't last a week.

843
01:15:51,931 --> 01:15:55,264
And if we did, we'd grow old,

844
01:15:55,389 --> 01:15:57,555
Quickly, in a world that
we no longer understand.

845
01:15:57,680 --> 01:15:58,763
Is that what you want?

846
01:15:58,889 --> 01:16:00,263
- No, of course not.
-  No!

847
01:16:00,389 --> 01:16:03,889
But we don't want legions
of pompous braggarts coming here either

848
01:16:04,014 --> 01:16:06,680
with their fancy new weapons,

849
01:16:06,806 --> 01:16:09,096
telling us how to live our lives, no.

850
01:16:09,222 --> 01:16:11,637
Now, you tell me how it's done.

851
01:16:11,764 --> 01:16:13,554
Is there a door?

852
01:16:14,930 --> 01:16:17,930
Or another sphere like the one
that brought us here?

853
01:16:18,057 --> 01:16:21,095
If you don't want to use it,
why do you care?

854
01:16:21,221 --> 01:16:23,387
Because, Dr. Fludd...

855
01:16:24,889 --> 01:16:26,930
I want to police it.

856
01:16:27,057 --> 01:16:29,722
I won't allow that to happen.

857
01:16:34,890 --> 01:16:37,388
I won't tolerate violence.

858
01:16:48,930 --> 01:16:51,096
Lay down your weapons.

859
01:16:51,222 --> 01:16:54,888
Gunpowder and lead
have no place here.

860
01:16:57,263 --> 01:17:00,471
Leave now,
and your lives will be spared!

861
01:17:00,598 --> 01:17:02,013
Shoot them!

862
01:17:02,139 --> 01:17:04,262
Shoot them all!

863
01:17:21,305 --> 01:17:25,929
You are dealing with forces
beyond your understanding.

864
01:17:30,554 --> 01:17:33,053
Run! Run for your lives!

865
01:17:34,887 --> 01:17:36,637
Peter!

866
01:17:39,220 --> 01:17:41,969
Peter, wait!
I need to talk to you!

867
01:17:42,095 --> 01:17:44,429
Peter! Over here.

868
01:17:49,264 --> 01:17:52,096
Make your way
for the door, men!

869
01:17:59,971 --> 01:18:01,387
This way!

870
01:18:05,971 --> 01:18:07,428
Dr. Fludd?

871
01:18:07,554 --> 01:18:10,928
It took me almost a century
to grow my city.

872
01:18:11,055 --> 01:18:14,220
Look how quickly it disappears.

873
01:18:16,220 --> 01:18:18,595
Where's Aaya?

874
01:18:18,721 --> 01:18:20,720
I don't know.

875
01:18:23,387 --> 01:18:27,387
Try and save the orb. I'll face them here.
Go, go, go. Go! Go!

876
01:18:36,763 --> 01:18:38,304
Aaaah!

877
01:18:40,721 --> 01:18:43,762
I don't want to hurt you, Fludd,
I just want to see Peter safe.

878
01:18:43,888 --> 01:18:45,927
Engaging you, Hook,
was a terrible mistake.

879
01:18:46,055 --> 01:18:48,261
The glass sphere, Fludd.
Where is it?

880
01:18:48,387 --> 01:18:50,094
I'd rather burn in hell.

881
01:18:50,220 --> 01:18:51,761
You're responsible for this!

882
01:19:01,554 --> 01:19:02,971
No!

883
01:19:17,220 --> 01:19:18,470
Peter!

884
01:19:21,221 --> 01:19:22,554
Move!

885
01:19:23,970 --> 01:19:26,262
Aaya! Where are you, Aaya?!

886
01:19:33,429 --> 01:19:35,718
Going back?

887
01:19:35,844 --> 01:19:38,594
- You can't have it.
- What makes you think I want it?

888
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:40,719
I heard your girlfriend.
You don't want people going back.

889
01:19:40,845 --> 01:19:44,679
That doesn't mean you, Peter.
I'll make sure you get back safely.

890
01:19:44,804 --> 01:19:46,803
Then let me take it back to my crew.

891
01:19:46,929 --> 01:19:49,012
I have a better idea.

892
01:19:49,137 --> 01:19:51,763
Why don't they come to us?

893
01:19:51,888 --> 01:19:53,594
Us? Who's "us"?

894
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:55,302
The pirates?!

895
01:19:55,428 --> 01:19:58,427
Because they will kill them!

896
01:19:58,553 --> 01:20:01,012
Just like they--
Just like they killed Fox.

897
01:20:01,137 --> 01:20:03,594
That was a terrible mistake.
I tried to stop it.

898
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:06,802
You let it happen!
You've become one of them!

899
01:20:09,262 --> 01:20:12,136
Listen to me, Peter.
There's something in this world

900
01:20:12,263 --> 01:20:14,345
that will completely change
our lives in London,

901
01:20:14,471 --> 01:20:17,093
make us more powerful
than you can ever imagine.

902
01:20:17,219 --> 01:20:19,426
And Bonny and her men
can help us find it.

903
01:20:19,553 --> 01:20:22,844
She's turned your head,
Jimmy.

904
01:20:26,054 --> 01:20:27,054
Give me that knife.

905
01:20:28,346 --> 01:20:30,553
I taught you too well.

906
01:20:49,137 --> 01:20:51,094
I swear, Peter,
I will run you through

907
01:20:51,219 --> 01:20:55,719
if you don't calm down
and let me explain what I found here!

908
01:20:55,844 --> 01:20:58,261
You don't care about me.
You just want that woman!

909
01:20:58,387 --> 01:21:00,386
You couldn't be more wrong.

910
01:21:01,804 --> 01:21:04,177
I didn't pull you out of that workhouse

911
01:21:04,303 --> 01:21:06,260
because I took pity on you, Peter--

912
01:21:06,386 --> 01:21:08,761
I did it because of the debt I owed...

913
01:21:11,928 --> 01:21:13,718
to your mother.

914
01:21:16,635 --> 01:21:18,511
You--You knew my mother?

915
01:21:28,344 --> 01:21:29,635
Very well.

916
01:21:31,719 --> 01:21:33,093
This is my mother?

917
01:21:33,219 --> 01:21:36,385
I vowed to bring you up
and rear you as my own.

918
01:21:37,969 --> 01:21:40,344
And I won't give up on you now.

919
01:21:49,470 --> 01:21:51,551
This is her watch?

920
01:21:52,427 --> 01:21:54,468
It was your father's.

921
01:21:57,094 --> 01:22:00,510
I hate to break up such a touching reunion,
but we have to get out of here.

922
01:22:00,636 --> 01:22:02,427
Give me another minute
with him, Liz.

923
01:22:02,552 --> 01:22:05,135
There is no time.
The place is a tinderbox.

924
01:22:08,053 --> 01:22:10,885
It's even more beautiful
than I remember.

925
01:22:14,052 --> 01:22:16,217
No! No!

926
01:22:24,553 --> 01:22:25,801
Peter!

927
01:22:25,927 --> 01:22:27,385
Hey, you! Hey, you! Wait!

928
01:22:30,761 --> 01:22:32,260
Ha! Come on!

929
01:22:47,136 --> 01:22:48,968
Leave him be!

930
01:22:49,093 --> 01:22:51,842
- Where is the squaw?!
- Tell them, Peter.

931
01:22:51,968 --> 01:22:54,218
I wouldn't tell your girlfriend
the time of day!

932
01:22:54,344 --> 01:22:56,968
I will give you one last chance
to redeem yourself.

933
01:23:04,761 --> 01:23:06,218
Stop!

934
01:23:07,593 --> 01:23:09,134
Let him live...

935
01:23:09,260 --> 01:23:12,176
and I will tell you
what you want to know.

936
01:23:14,094 --> 01:23:15,676
And what is that?

937
01:23:15,803 --> 01:23:19,676
How to get into
the tree spirit colony...

938
01:23:19,802 --> 01:23:23,426
and the secret of the mineral dust.

939
01:23:23,552 --> 01:23:24,967
No, Aaya! Run!

940
01:23:25,093 --> 01:23:26,800
Agghh!

941
01:23:26,926 --> 01:23:28,925
And you'll do this...

942
01:23:30,426 --> 01:23:32,925
just to keep him alive?

943
01:23:33,052 --> 01:23:35,008
Only if you set him free.

944
01:23:35,135 --> 01:23:36,550
Aaya, run!

945
01:23:36,677 --> 01:23:38,092
Tie her up.

946
01:23:40,719 --> 01:23:42,469
Come on, Aaya! Run!

947
01:23:43,844 --> 01:23:46,010
-  Peter!
- No!

948
01:23:47,886 --> 01:23:51,092
No! No! No!

949
01:24:01,551 --> 01:24:02,926
There.

950
01:24:04,927 --> 01:24:06,884
I set him free.

951
01:24:08,593 --> 01:24:10,051
Now let's get out of here.

952
01:24:19,177 --> 01:24:20,269
Dear God.

953
01:25:27,745 --> 01:25:31,076
Now I see why you were
so protective of the boy.

954
01:25:32,243 --> 01:25:34,159
But you mustn't brood, Hook.

955
01:25:35,618 --> 01:25:38,951
The stars have finally shifted
in our favor.

956
01:25:41,411 --> 01:25:43,784
When Starkey's finished
with the chief's daughter...

957
01:25:45,785 --> 01:25:51,161
oh, she'll tell us whatever
we need to know.

958
01:25:51,287 --> 01:25:53,035
No, she won't talk. Not now.

959
01:25:53,161 --> 01:25:56,242
Well, Starkey's never let me down.

960
01:26:02,202 --> 01:26:05,283
This is the tree spirit
colony here, right?

961
01:26:05,410 --> 01:26:08,284
Surrounded by
impregnable mountains.

962
01:26:08,410 --> 01:26:11,493
What about this narrow ravine
by the Kaw settlement?

963
01:26:11,618 --> 01:26:13,909
Fifty feet wide.

964
01:26:14,035 --> 01:26:16,034
We can rope across.

965
01:26:16,159 --> 01:26:19,324
Nope.
We'd be sitting ducks.

966
01:26:19,450 --> 01:26:21,992
Not if we bring
that princess hostage.

967
01:26:22,118 --> 01:26:23,783
That's a big risk.

968
01:26:23,910 --> 01:26:26,284
A risk worth taking.

969
01:26:26,409 --> 01:26:29,118
We set off at first light.
Ready ten of your best men.

970
01:26:29,244 --> 01:26:31,868
I am captain.
I will decide what's best.

971
01:26:31,994 --> 01:26:34,409
You listen to me!

972
01:26:34,535 --> 01:26:37,367
Now that I have the orb,
I intend to return to London,

973
01:26:37,494 --> 01:26:39,076
but not before I have the power

974
01:26:39,202 --> 01:26:41,576
of the mineral dust
coursing through my veins.

975
01:26:41,702 --> 01:26:44,116
I will be a god amongst men,

976
01:26:44,243 --> 01:26:46,367
and rule over the same
London society

977
01:26:46,494 --> 01:26:48,783
that banished me to the fringes
of the East End.

978
01:26:48,910 --> 01:26:51,366
Countless scores will be settled.

979
01:26:53,826 --> 01:26:56,034
You have a choice, Liz.

980
01:26:56,159 --> 01:27:00,325
Stand with me and have all the thrills
of the modern world at your fingertips,

981
01:27:00,451 --> 01:27:05,533
or remain here and rule over
the living dead for the rest of eternity.

982
01:28:51,074 --> 01:28:53,072
Now you are like us.

983
01:28:55,324 --> 01:28:58,157
- Where am I?
- My kingdom.

984
01:28:58,283 --> 01:29:02,281
- You speak English?
- No. I'm using my mind, Peter.

985
01:29:02,407 --> 01:29:04,365
Thoughts have no language.

986
01:29:04,491 --> 01:29:07,364
But the mineral dust gives you
the power to hear our people.

987
01:29:07,491 --> 01:29:10,490
- What happened to Aaya?
- The pirates have her.

988
01:29:14,324 --> 01:29:15,616
Easy, Peter.

989
01:29:15,741 --> 01:29:18,407
The elders have closed your wound,
but it's not yet healed.

990
01:29:18,533 --> 01:29:21,281
- That will take many days.
- I'm so cold.

991
01:29:21,407 --> 01:29:25,447
Your clothes are ready,
repaired with silk from our farms.

992
01:29:25,573 --> 01:29:27,864
Come. You must go before
the three elders

993
01:29:27,990 --> 01:29:30,530
who rule our kingdom.

994
01:29:31,907 --> 01:29:35,697
Your kind pose
a great threat to our world.

995
01:29:35,823 --> 01:29:38,114
So we ask for your help.

996
01:29:38,239 --> 01:29:40,782
Find the magic orb
and bring it to us.

997
01:29:40,909 --> 01:29:44,239
We will use it
to send home your kind.

998
01:29:44,365 --> 01:29:47,615
Your new powers will help
in this endeavor.

999
01:29:47,742 --> 01:29:49,614
Powers?

1000
01:29:49,740 --> 01:29:51,822
Close your eyes, Peter.

1001
01:29:57,241 --> 01:29:59,031
Breathe softly.

1002
01:29:59,157 --> 01:30:01,031
Clear your mind.

1003
01:30:02,365 --> 01:30:05,781
Imagine you're floating
in a warm sea,

1004
01:30:05,908 --> 01:30:07,530
drifting safely,

1005
01:30:07,656 --> 01:30:10,114
and you're blissfully happy...

1006
01:30:10,240 --> 01:30:13,448
so happy you don't even feel
the water under you,

1007
01:30:13,573 --> 01:30:17,238
just a warm breeze
holding you up...

1008
01:30:18,322 --> 01:30:19,906
up...

1009
01:30:22,741 --> 01:30:25,739
Aaah! Aaaah!

1010
01:30:25,865 --> 01:30:29,280
Oh, my--aaaah!

1011
01:30:29,406 --> 01:30:32,281
No, Peter!
You must stay relaxed!

1012
01:30:32,407 --> 01:30:34,323
Close your eyes again.

1013
01:30:34,449 --> 01:30:36,362
Peter, breathe normally.

1014
01:30:36,489 --> 01:30:38,489
Trust in yourself.

1015
01:30:40,364 --> 01:30:42,447
Good! Clear your mind.

1016
01:30:42,572 --> 01:30:45,488
Picture the clouds around you,
feel the wind on your face.

1017
01:30:45,614 --> 01:30:49,321
The wind is your friend, Peter,
the wind carries you.

1018
01:30:49,447 --> 01:30:51,780
Now open your eyes.

1019
01:30:55,531 --> 01:30:56,905
How is it happening?

1020
01:30:57,031 --> 01:30:58,947
You are doing it, Peter.

1021
01:30:59,072 --> 01:31:03,655
The mineral dust gives you the power,
but you must control it.

1022
01:31:03,781 --> 01:31:06,404
- How
- With your heart.

1023
01:31:06,530 --> 01:31:08,238
It responds to the way you feel,

1024
01:31:08,364 --> 01:31:12,113
but if you doubt yourself,
it will falter.

1025
01:31:12,239 --> 01:31:14,364
Look down, Peter.

1026
01:31:14,490 --> 01:31:17,614
Our world suffers.

1027
01:31:17,740 --> 01:31:19,113
Help us.

1028
01:31:19,239 --> 01:31:23,362
Get us the magic orb
so we can stop this brutality.

1029
01:31:23,489 --> 01:31:27,029
- Why me?
- You still have an innocent heart, Peter.

1030
01:31:27,155 --> 01:31:30,987
It's a quality we share,
and trust.

1031
01:32:08,238 --> 01:32:11,279
Crossing that ravine
is a foolish waste of time.

1032
01:32:11,405 --> 01:32:14,196
It's likely to get us all killed!

1033
01:32:14,321 --> 01:32:18,945
Your courage has always impressed,
Starkey.

1034
01:32:19,071 --> 01:32:21,280
The ravine is a death trap.

1035
01:32:21,405 --> 01:32:23,737
So stay here!
Darn your socks!

1036
01:32:28,530 --> 01:32:31,738
What has happened to you, Liz?
Hmm?

1037
01:32:41,571 --> 01:32:43,153
Ahem!

1038
01:32:44,237 --> 01:32:47,153
You're wearing
my best suit of clothes.

1039
01:32:49,696 --> 01:32:51,695
Not anymore.

1040
01:32:51,821 --> 01:32:54,695
I should have dropped you
when I had the chance.

1041
01:32:56,863 --> 01:32:58,819
Then drop me now.

1042
01:32:58,945 --> 01:33:00,111
Hmm.

1043
01:33:08,155 --> 01:33:10,196
That's a coward's weapon.

1044
01:33:10,322 --> 01:33:13,404
I'd prefer it if you killed me
with a sword.

1045
01:33:13,529 --> 01:33:15,487
Here.

1046
01:33:16,362 --> 01:33:17,861
You can use mine.

1047
01:33:27,528 --> 01:33:29,986
Look at your men!

1048
01:33:30,112 --> 01:33:32,777
Do you see any of them
run to your defense?

1049
01:33:32,904 --> 01:33:34,444
Hmm?

1050
01:33:34,570 --> 01:33:37,278
Two hundred years
on the same boat,

1051
01:33:37,405 --> 01:33:40,320
and no one cares
if you live or die.

1052
01:33:43,737 --> 01:33:46,777
You're mine now.
You understand?

1053
01:33:52,737 --> 01:33:54,235
This is amazing!

1054
01:33:57,237 --> 01:33:59,235
Ha ha ha! Whoa!

1055
01:33:59,361 --> 01:34:02,320
Steady, Peter!
Let the wind guide you.

1056
01:34:02,446 --> 01:34:05,069
Peter! Lean into the breeze!

1057
01:34:05,195 --> 01:34:07,611
-
- You're going too fast!

1058
01:34:07,737 --> 01:34:10,234
Remember,
short, fast breaths.

1059
01:34:11,486 --> 01:34:13,485
Aaah! Aaaah!

1060
01:34:13,611 --> 01:34:14,610
Aah aaah!

1061
01:34:14,736 --> 01:34:16,028
Look out!

1062
01:34:16,153 --> 01:34:18,652
Aaah...whoa!

1063
01:34:18,777 --> 01:34:20,153
Ohh!

1064
01:34:22,903 --> 01:34:24,903
Peter, are you all right?

1065
01:34:25,029 --> 01:34:28,611
Peter.

1066
01:34:28,737 --> 01:34:30,486
Boo!

1067
01:34:30,612 --> 01:34:31,777
Got ya.

1068
01:34:31,904 --> 01:34:34,151
I can't teach you
if you act like a child.

1069
01:34:34,277 --> 01:34:37,067
Yeah, but I thought that's what
you liked about me.

1070
01:34:40,528 --> 01:34:41,985
You need to rest.

1071
01:34:42,111 --> 01:34:44,319
Your wound will take
many days to heal.

1072
01:34:44,445 --> 01:34:47,777
I've got to go now, Tink.
Rescue Aaya and get back to my crew.

1073
01:34:47,903 --> 01:34:49,401
Your crew?

1074
01:34:49,527 --> 01:34:53,487
My friends. They're the ones
I'll get home first once I've found the orb.

1075
01:34:53,612 --> 01:34:55,444
You're not ready, Peter.

1076
01:35:04,445 --> 01:35:07,861
The sun's going down.
We can't rope across in the dark.

1077
01:35:10,569 --> 01:35:12,818
We'd better stop for the night.

1078
01:35:24,068 --> 01:35:28,567
If I do find a way home,
I'll be back for you and the others.

1079
01:35:28,693 --> 01:35:31,108
So how do we get back?

1080
01:35:31,234 --> 01:35:32,443
Tie her up!

1081
01:35:32,569 --> 01:35:34,776
- Now we're stuck here!
- Wherever "here" is.

1082
01:35:34,903 --> 01:35:36,650
Aaya, run!

1083
01:36:14,818 --> 01:36:16,818
Bloody hell.

1084
01:36:23,693 --> 01:36:26,193
Ooh, my God! Sweet mother of--

1085
01:36:31,735 --> 01:36:35,566
- What do you want here, specter?
- The alchemist's glass orb.

1086
01:36:35,692 --> 01:36:38,274
Fetch it--
I will spare your life.

1087
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:40,900
I don't know where it is.
None of us do.

1088
01:36:41,026 --> 01:36:44,192
The captain hid it
somewhere on shore.

1089
01:36:44,318 --> 01:36:46,484
If you don't own up, pirate,

1090
01:36:46,610 --> 01:36:48,524
you'll be wearing your tonsils
for earrings!

1091
01:36:48,650 --> 01:36:51,442
Now, listen, they wouldn't
bring it onboard,

1092
01:36:51,568 --> 01:36:54,775
it's too sensitive, so they buried it
somewhere on Bull Island.

1093
01:36:54,902 --> 01:36:56,232
"They"?

1094
01:36:56,359 --> 01:36:59,108
Yeah. Captain Bonny
and Master Hook.

1095
01:36:59,234 --> 01:37:01,233
Well, you must have some idea
where it is.

1096
01:37:01,359 --> 01:37:03,650
They took it out
in the middle of the night.

1097
01:37:03,775 --> 01:37:06,941
I swear to you, specter,
they are the only ones

1098
01:37:07,067 --> 01:37:09,024
that know where it is.

1099
01:37:09,150 --> 01:37:10,609
Very well.

1100
01:37:10,735 --> 01:37:14,692
Fetch the chief's daughter,
and I will leave you in peace.

1101
01:37:14,818 --> 01:37:16,733
Oh, God.

1102
01:37:16,859 --> 01:37:18,941
Keep moving, men!

1103
01:37:21,692 --> 01:37:23,149
This is the ravine here!

1104
01:37:23,275 --> 01:37:26,649
Yes, but the Indian village
is further along.

1105
01:37:26,775 --> 01:37:28,191
Well, this looks unguarded.

1106
01:37:28,317 --> 01:37:30,442
If we cross here,
we can go around them.

1107
01:37:30,568 --> 01:37:35,275
It's unguarded because the web
was made by man-eating spiders.

1108
01:37:35,400 --> 01:37:37,483
Then we should cross with care!

1109
01:37:37,609 --> 01:37:41,649
I'd rather face a few spiders
than a hundred angry braves.

1110
01:38:07,650 --> 01:38:08,900
Aaah!

1111
01:38:11,734 --> 01:38:13,274
Pull her up!

1112
01:38:13,400 --> 01:38:14,983
I'm trying.

1113
01:38:16,193 --> 01:38:18,025
Aah!

1114
01:38:18,151 --> 01:38:19,983
Come over and help me!

1115
01:38:27,317 --> 01:38:28,607
Aaah!

1116
01:38:29,400 --> 01:38:30,898
Aaaah!

1117
01:38:49,525 --> 01:38:50,940
How did you do that?

1118
01:38:54,191 --> 01:38:55,940
What's wrong?

1119
01:38:56,066 --> 01:38:57,940
I'm fine. I'm fine.

1120
01:38:58,066 --> 01:39:00,773
- I'm fine.
- The mineral dust.

1121
01:39:00,900 --> 01:39:02,732
It's in your skin.

1122
01:39:03,857 --> 01:39:06,024
Wait here.

1123
01:39:06,150 --> 01:39:09,399
I'll come back for you
and we'll climb up together.

1124
01:39:28,816 --> 01:39:30,482
Is it really you?

1125
01:39:30,608 --> 01:39:33,064
Back from the dead.

1126
01:39:33,191 --> 01:39:34,940
How did you survive?

1127
01:39:35,065 --> 01:39:37,899
I have friends in high places.

1128
01:39:40,565 --> 01:39:41,772
Santa Madonna!

1129
01:39:41,899 --> 01:39:45,565
The mineral dust--
he's covered in it!

1130
01:39:45,690 --> 01:39:48,314
You were saved
by the tree spirits?

1131
01:39:48,440 --> 01:39:50,898
And I see you've become
one of them.

1132
01:39:51,024 --> 01:39:52,605
Fludd's orb, Jimmy--

1133
01:39:52,732 --> 01:39:54,356
where did you hide it?

1134
01:39:54,482 --> 01:39:56,355
I can't tell you here.

1135
01:39:59,315 --> 01:40:01,939
Hurting me won't help, Peter.

1136
01:40:04,106 --> 01:40:05,105
You're right.

1137
01:40:06,732 --> 01:40:09,981
But hurting your girlfriend might.

1138
01:40:10,107 --> 01:40:13,105
- You're not a murderer, Peter!
- Aaaah!

1139
01:40:13,231 --> 01:40:14,772
Perhaps I've changed!

1140
01:40:14,899 --> 01:40:17,731
Aaaah! Aah!

1141
01:40:35,231 --> 01:40:40,230
All I have to do is cut the rope,
and down you go.

1142
01:40:42,190 --> 01:40:44,272
Now, I know it's on Bull Island...

1143
01:40:44,399 --> 01:40:46,397
but where?

1144
01:40:51,148 --> 01:40:53,063
I said where?!

1145
01:40:57,230 --> 01:41:00,981
Wait! Don't pull her up yet.
He'll cut the rope.

1146
01:41:05,231 --> 01:41:06,230
Stop!

1147
01:41:07,607 --> 01:41:09,189
Aah!

1148
01:41:11,106 --> 01:41:14,563
Well? What's it to be, Jimmy?

1149
01:41:18,021 --> 01:41:20,061
Pull her up now!

1150
01:41:30,440 --> 01:41:34,104
We have to take him with us.
He knows the secret of the mineral dust.

1151
01:41:55,272 --> 01:41:59,021
See, I knew it was possible
to take their power.

1152
01:42:09,022 --> 01:42:11,062
Oh...

1153
01:42:11,189 --> 01:42:12,730
Wake up, boy.

1154
01:42:14,105 --> 01:42:15,563
Wake up.

1155
01:42:17,063 --> 01:42:19,770
There's more than the flying,
isn't there?

1156
01:42:19,897 --> 01:42:21,604
Hmm?

1157
01:42:21,730 --> 01:42:24,938
The power lives inside you,
doesn't it?

1158
01:42:25,063 --> 01:42:27,520
It nourishes you from inside.

1159
01:42:29,021 --> 01:42:31,478
Now, you tell me what that's like.

1160
01:42:36,812 --> 01:42:38,061
Wake up.

1161
01:42:39,562 --> 01:42:41,896
Wake up. How did you do it?

1162
01:42:42,897 --> 01:42:44,771
What did you do?

1163
01:42:45,771 --> 01:42:47,854
What did you do?!

1164
01:42:47,979 --> 01:42:49,854
He's getting weaker.

1165
01:42:50,896 --> 01:42:52,978
His wound has opened up.

1166
01:42:53,104 --> 01:42:54,935
I've tried to dress it, but...

1167
01:42:55,061 --> 01:42:56,812
I want it. I want it!

1168
01:43:01,395 --> 01:43:02,978
We're finished, Hook.

1169
01:43:03,103 --> 01:43:06,270
I have lost eleven men
since you arrived.

1170
01:43:06,396 --> 01:43:09,770
And for what?
A wild-goose chase to nowhere!

1171
01:43:09,896 --> 01:43:12,935
- Peter will help us now.
- He probably won't even survive the night.

1172
01:43:13,061 --> 01:43:15,602
You have worked your charm on me
for the last time, Hook!

1173
01:43:15,728 --> 01:43:17,268
No!

1174
01:43:22,229 --> 01:43:23,437
Starkey!

1175
01:43:28,854 --> 01:43:30,312
Keep him alive...

1176
01:43:30,438 --> 01:43:32,895
till I've decided my next move.

1177
01:43:35,437 --> 01:43:37,643
Jimmy took him back
to the pirate ship?

1178
01:43:37,769 --> 01:43:39,269
I think so.

1179
01:43:40,561 --> 01:43:41,935
I'm sorry.

1180
01:43:43,103 --> 01:43:46,020
He's back with the pirates.
They saved him from the spider,

1181
01:43:46,146 --> 01:43:49,935
so they must have wanted him alive.

1182
01:43:54,062 --> 01:43:55,311
A gift.

1183
01:44:00,687 --> 01:44:03,437
I'm not wearing that.

1184
01:44:03,562 --> 01:44:04,935
Me neither.

1185
01:44:05,061 --> 01:44:09,518
Why not? They're tougher
than our old clothes.

1186
01:44:09,644 --> 01:44:12,478
We have to get Peter out--
like he got us out.

1187
01:44:12,604 --> 01:44:14,978
Don't be daft.
Have you forgotten what he did to Fox?

1188
01:44:15,103 --> 01:44:17,145
And you want the same
to happen to Peter?

1189
01:44:17,270 --> 01:44:18,603
Let's show a little bottle.

1190
01:44:18,729 --> 01:44:20,895
They're two peas in a pod,
if you ask me.

1191
01:44:21,021 --> 01:44:23,893
Peter always wanted to stand
shoulder to shoulder with Jimmy.

1192
01:44:24,019 --> 01:44:26,101
Now he's got his wish.

1193
01:44:28,561 --> 01:44:30,310
It's not the same
without him.

1194
01:44:30,436 --> 01:44:33,227
No. It's a lot safer.

1195
01:44:33,353 --> 01:44:36,226
Who's gonna take his place?

1196
01:44:36,352 --> 01:44:37,934
You?

1197
01:44:38,060 --> 01:44:40,727
- We'd be better off.
- You don't have it in ya.

1198
01:44:40,853 --> 01:44:43,103
Oh, we'll see.

1199
01:44:43,229 --> 01:44:45,768
Tomorrow I'll lead the croc hunt,

1200
01:44:45,895 --> 01:44:49,477
and when I bring one of them beasties in,
the Indians will make me a blood brother,

1201
01:44:49,603 --> 01:44:53,394
and then, perhaps,
you'll show me some respect.

1202
01:44:54,394 --> 01:44:56,726
You signed up for the croc hunt?

1203
01:45:13,518 --> 01:45:16,641
Come on, Curly,
you said you'd do it.

1204
01:45:52,685 --> 01:45:55,225
-  Run, Curly!

1205
01:47:37,641 --> 01:47:39,140
Boys.

1206
01:47:39,892 --> 01:47:41,640
Where's Curly?

1207
01:47:54,601 --> 01:47:57,891
Â¤hal has something to give you.

1208
01:48:04,933 --> 01:48:08,933
The first time he faced Xaw,

1209
01:48:09,058 --> 01:48:11,349
he was so scared

1210
01:48:11,476 --> 01:48:15,099
he ran and didn't return to the village
for many days.

1211
01:48:16,141 --> 01:48:19,391
When he did, I told him,

1212
01:48:19,516 --> 01:48:21,599
"Fear is good.

1213
01:48:21,725 --> 01:48:25,182
Fear is part of us."

1214
01:48:25,308 --> 01:48:28,515
But he was too ashamed to listen.

1215
01:48:28,640 --> 01:48:32,850
Today you helped Xyhal prove to us

1216
01:48:32,975 --> 01:48:37,057
that he has great courage after all.

1217
01:48:38,184 --> 01:48:40,973
For this,
he is very grateful.

1218
01:48:42,682 --> 01:48:46,265
He wants you to have
his father's bear tooth.

1219
01:49:23,308 --> 01:49:24,681
-
- Ohh!

1220
01:49:33,890 --> 01:49:35,763
Peter.

1221
01:49:35,889 --> 01:49:38,014
Peter, are you okay?

1222
01:49:38,140 --> 01:49:39,264
Jimmy?

1223
01:49:39,390 --> 01:49:41,888
Shh. Drink.

1224
01:49:48,557 --> 01:49:51,557
I'm so sorry, Peter,
I've been a complete fool.

1225
01:49:53,724 --> 01:49:55,097
Come on.

1226
01:49:55,223 --> 01:49:57,263
Put your arm around me.

1227
01:49:57,389 --> 01:49:59,347
I'm taking you home.

1228
01:50:41,264 --> 01:50:43,181
Feeling better?

1229
01:50:44,805 --> 01:50:46,555
How did we get here?

1230
01:50:49,847 --> 01:50:51,597
Berry water.

1231
01:50:51,723 --> 01:50:54,054
Not as sweet as it sounds.

1232
01:50:55,264 --> 01:50:58,221
I challenged the lads
to a drinking game.

1233
01:50:58,347 --> 01:51:01,388
There'll be a few sore heads
this morning.

1234
01:51:03,514 --> 01:51:04,846
What happened?

1235
01:51:04,971 --> 01:51:08,137
Well, after that, it was easy

1236
01:51:08,263 --> 01:51:10,597
to steal a rowing boat and--

1237
01:51:10,722 --> 01:51:12,388
No, um...

1238
01:51:14,307 --> 01:51:17,597
I mean, what happened to you?

1239
01:51:17,723 --> 01:51:19,722
I woke up.

1240
01:51:20,513 --> 01:51:22,096
And your lady friend?

1241
01:51:22,222 --> 01:51:25,805
She'll have to find someone else
to wrap around her little finger.

1242
01:51:45,263 --> 01:51:47,554
I thought I'd lost you, Peter.

1243
01:51:50,473 --> 01:51:52,762
And although I hated Bonny
for what she did,

1244
01:51:52,889 --> 01:51:54,928
I had nowhere else to go.

1245
01:51:57,096 --> 01:52:00,721
I can't deny she had a hold
on me, she's a...

1246
01:52:02,388 --> 01:52:03,928
very...

1247
01:52:05,847 --> 01:52:07,846
hypnotic woman.

1248
01:52:10,972 --> 01:52:12,763
But when I saw you...

1249
01:52:14,305 --> 01:52:15,845
alive...

1250
01:52:18,387 --> 01:52:20,261
I woke up.

1251
01:52:22,887 --> 01:52:27,387
Now all I want to do is
get us home safely...

1252
01:52:27,512 --> 01:52:29,678
go back to things as they were.

1253
01:52:31,054 --> 01:52:32,761
Hmm?

1254
01:52:32,888 --> 01:52:34,220
Ohh.

1255
01:52:42,096 --> 01:52:43,260
Here.

1256
01:52:46,846 --> 01:52:50,721
It's a bit chewy, but it tastes good
when you're hungry.

1257
01:52:51,887 --> 01:52:53,304
Hmm.

1258
01:52:56,263 --> 01:52:57,970
What now?

1259
01:53:00,429 --> 01:53:04,010
We gather up the lads
and hurry to the caves on Bull Island

1260
01:53:04,136 --> 01:53:07,053
before Bonny figures out
where we've gone.

1261
01:53:07,180 --> 01:53:08,720
The caves?

1262
01:53:08,845 --> 01:53:11,094
A weird place.
A labyrinth.

1263
01:53:11,220 --> 01:53:13,928
But the perfect place
to hide the orb.

1264
01:53:14,054 --> 01:53:16,553
Are you ready to go home, Peter?

1265
01:53:18,637 --> 01:53:19,928
Yeah.

1266
01:53:20,054 --> 01:53:21,428
Can you walk?

1267
01:53:21,554 --> 01:53:23,969
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, no, I think so.

1268
01:53:24,095 --> 01:53:26,219
Unh! Ow!

1269
01:53:29,678 --> 01:53:32,093
- Which way?
- You tell me.

1270
01:53:32,220 --> 01:53:33,969
Where are the lads?

1271
01:53:40,803 --> 01:53:42,427
This way.

1272
01:53:47,430 --> 01:53:50,553
Jenny was the most beautiful woman
I'd ever met.

1273
01:53:50,679 --> 01:53:53,885
- How did you meet?
- At the Granville Club.

1274
01:53:54,011 --> 01:53:56,469
I was in the arms trade--
respectable, well-off.

1275
01:53:56,595 --> 01:53:58,261
She was treading the boards.

1276
01:53:58,387 --> 01:54:01,011
Only the best West End theaters,
mind you.

1277
01:54:01,136 --> 01:54:04,011
- And my dad?
- He came later.

1278
01:54:04,137 --> 01:54:06,260
Stole her away from me.

1279
01:54:06,385 --> 01:54:08,136
No hard feelings.

1280
01:54:08,262 --> 01:54:10,553
I always knew she was
too good for me.

1281
01:54:10,678 --> 01:54:12,428
What was he like?

1282
01:54:14,385 --> 01:54:17,135
- Look in the mirror.
- I look like him?

1283
01:54:17,261 --> 01:54:19,759
I always thought
you looked like your mother.

1284
01:54:19,886 --> 01:54:22,051
Now I see him.

1285
01:54:22,178 --> 01:54:24,760
That's because
I'm finally growing up.

1286
01:54:24,886 --> 01:54:27,010
What happened to him?

1287
01:54:27,136 --> 01:54:30,135
All I know is he died
before you were born.

1288
01:54:30,261 --> 01:54:34,594
When I heard, I went looking for Jenny,
tracked her down to the workhouse.

1289
01:54:34,720 --> 01:54:37,135
Got there five years too late.

1290
01:54:38,470 --> 01:54:40,551
And you wound up
with me instead.

1291
01:54:40,677 --> 01:54:42,593
The consolation prize.

1292
01:54:44,594 --> 01:54:46,593
When we get back...

1293
01:54:48,094 --> 01:54:50,093
it'll be like old times,
won't it, Jimmy?

1294
01:54:50,219 --> 01:54:53,092
Working the East End,
you know?

1295
01:54:53,218 --> 01:54:56,342
Apart from I won't have to
climb up no rooftops no more--

1296
01:54:56,469 --> 01:54:58,427
I can just fly up.

1297
01:54:58,553 --> 01:55:01,217
Yes, that'll come in
very handy.

1298
01:55:06,552 --> 01:55:07,884
Shh.

1299
01:55:09,012 --> 01:55:12,469
There's a scout 50 yards away,
halfway up a tree.

1300
01:55:14,178 --> 01:55:16,218
How do you know?

1301
01:55:16,344 --> 01:55:18,384
I can feel it.

1302
01:55:18,510 --> 01:55:20,427
I can feel a lot of things now.

1303
01:55:20,552 --> 01:55:22,427
What else can you do?

1304
01:55:22,552 --> 01:55:23,718
Shh.

1305
01:55:24,552 --> 01:55:26,216
We'll go this way.

1306
01:55:32,469 --> 01:55:36,509
Don't look like much from out here,
but inside it's huge.

1307
01:55:36,635 --> 01:55:38,383
And it goes all the way
through the mountains?

1308
01:55:38,509 --> 01:55:41,134
It's not as far as you'd think,
but it's dark.

1309
01:55:41,260 --> 01:55:42,925
We'll need torches.

1310
01:55:43,051 --> 01:55:45,385
No. I'll light the way.

1311
01:55:46,760 --> 01:55:48,550
There's a lookout on each end.

1312
01:55:49,885 --> 01:55:51,467
- Just one?
- Yeah.

1313
01:55:51,593 --> 01:55:53,842
But one can turn into twenty
in a heartbeat,

1314
01:55:53,968 --> 01:55:57,675
so I better go talk to him,
tell him why I'm here with a pirate.

1315
01:56:04,844 --> 01:56:05,842
Hello.

1316
01:56:05,968 --> 01:56:07,675
Peter?

1317
01:56:07,801 --> 01:56:10,675
Yeah, yeah, that's right.
I'm Peter.

1318
01:56:15,051 --> 01:56:16,799
What are you doing?

1319
01:56:16,925 --> 01:56:20,467
No, get off me!
Are you crazy? Stop!

1320
01:56:20,593 --> 01:56:22,717
Is this the only scout?

1321
01:56:22,843 --> 01:56:25,633
- There's another at the end of the passage.
- No! You can't tell them that!

1322
01:56:25,759 --> 01:56:28,634
I'm sorry, Peter.
This way no one gets hurt.

1323
01:56:28,760 --> 01:56:30,092
It was all a trick?

1324
01:56:30,218 --> 01:56:31,884
It was the only way I could
get you to cooperate.

1325
01:56:32,011 --> 01:56:34,842
Like it or not, you're still a child. There are
some things you'll never understand.

1326
01:56:34,968 --> 01:56:38,424
- Yeah, like betraying your friends?!
- I just want what you've got!

1327
01:56:38,550 --> 01:56:41,592
You've redeemed yourself
in spades, Hook.

1328
01:56:41,718 --> 01:56:44,967
Perhaps I was too quick to doubt.

1329
01:56:48,717 --> 01:56:50,175
We should hurry.

1330
01:56:50,300 --> 01:56:53,884
It'll be clinical, we'll be in and out
before anyone notices.

1331
01:56:54,009 --> 01:56:57,049
- I trusted you.
- You've done the right thing, Peter.

1332
01:56:57,176 --> 01:57:01,049
Believe me, it'll all turn out for the best,
I promise. Now come on.

1333
01:57:15,259 --> 01:57:17,757
It's even more beautiful
than I imagined.

1334
01:57:23,132 --> 01:57:24,923
Where are they?

1335
01:57:27,008 --> 01:57:28,756
Over there.

1336
01:57:36,633 --> 01:57:37,924
Ready, men?

1337
01:57:38,050 --> 01:57:39,425
Ready.

1338
01:57:44,383 --> 01:57:46,966
- What are they doing?
- It's just something to ward them off.

1339
01:57:47,092 --> 01:57:48,340
No.

1340
01:57:52,049 --> 01:57:54,090
Now, Starkey!

1341
01:58:11,174 --> 01:58:13,173
You're killing them!

1342
01:58:13,299 --> 01:58:16,338
They shouldn't come so close!
Then they wouldn't get hurt!

1343
01:58:33,467 --> 01:58:35,340
You murderers!

1344
01:58:41,716 --> 01:58:44,590
- Get off me! Get off me!
- Keep still!

1345
01:58:53,841 --> 01:58:56,548
Where do we find
the mineral dust?

1346
01:59:00,298 --> 01:59:01,590
Shh.

1347
01:59:03,215 --> 01:59:06,590
Look, we can't undo what we've done,
but once we have what we came for,

1348
01:59:06,716 --> 01:59:08,423
we'll disappear back to London.

1349
01:59:08,549 --> 01:59:09,756
Don't you see?

1350
01:59:09,883 --> 01:59:13,798
The best way to get rid of us
is by telling us what we want to know.

1351
01:59:19,215 --> 01:59:21,380
You promise to leave forever?

1352
02:00:27,007 --> 02:00:28,464
The mineral.

1353
02:00:28,590 --> 02:00:30,714
It's in the rock.

1354
02:00:32,964 --> 02:00:34,754
How do we get it out?

1355
02:00:38,715 --> 02:00:40,837
You swim through it.

1356
02:00:40,964 --> 02:00:42,963
Give me some room.

1357
02:01:08,965 --> 02:01:10,963
Where will she come out?

1358
02:01:12,506 --> 02:01:14,171
There.

1359
02:01:28,880 --> 02:01:30,503
Take him.

1360
02:01:58,129 --> 02:01:59,379
Hurry, Hook.

1361
02:01:59,504 --> 02:02:01,713
It'll transform you.

1362
02:02:01,839 --> 02:02:04,629
It's everything I dreamed of.

1363
02:02:24,463 --> 02:02:26,628
What went wrong?

1364
02:02:26,754 --> 02:02:28,254
What happened?

1365
02:02:28,380 --> 02:02:30,129
I don't know.

1366
02:02:30,254 --> 02:02:33,628
She did everything
exactly as I did.

1367
02:02:33,753 --> 02:02:36,210
- Except...
- Except what?!

1368
02:02:37,337 --> 02:02:41,128
The tree spirits were here then,
singing a strange song.

1369
02:02:41,254 --> 02:02:44,669
You're just like your father!

1370
02:02:44,795 --> 02:02:47,212
Self-righteous, smug!

1371
02:02:48,921 --> 02:02:52,254
And I see through your innocence
just as I saw through his!

1372
02:02:52,380 --> 02:02:53,962
What are you talking about?

1373
02:02:54,087 --> 02:02:56,794
You think I'd let him
get away with humiliating me?!

1374
02:02:56,920 --> 02:02:59,043
Stealing my girl?!

1375
02:02:59,170 --> 02:03:01,002
Oh, there were no hard feelings

1376
02:03:01,129 --> 02:03:03,919
once I cut him open
like a Christmas goose!

1377
02:03:04,045 --> 02:03:05,295
You killed my father!

1378
02:03:05,421 --> 02:03:06,836
He had his chance!

1379
02:03:06,962 --> 02:03:09,211
It was a fair duel!

1380
02:03:09,337 --> 02:03:12,128
So why did you take me?

1381
02:03:19,544 --> 02:03:21,543
I loved your mother.

1382
02:03:28,295 --> 02:03:30,293
And I saw her in you.

1383
02:03:32,380 --> 02:03:35,544
Stupidly thought
I could ease the guilt

1384
02:03:35,671 --> 02:03:37,752
by rearing you as my own!

1385
02:03:37,879 --> 02:03:42,043
But all I raised was
another one just like him!

1386
02:03:55,212 --> 02:03:57,626
Head for the woods!

1387
02:05:49,335 --> 02:05:52,418
4,000 years lost
in one night.

1388
02:05:52,544 --> 02:05:54,208
I'm sorry. They tricked me.

1389
02:05:54,334 --> 02:05:56,667
You wanted to give them
what we gave you--

1390
02:05:56,793 --> 02:05:58,375
please the one called Hook,

1391
02:05:58,501 --> 02:06:01,917
allowed his greed and ambition
to corrupt your innocent heart.

1392
02:06:02,043 --> 02:06:05,666
- I made a mistake.
- A mistake which has cost us dear.

1393
02:06:05,791 --> 02:06:07,417
For that, you must pay.

1394
02:06:07,543 --> 02:06:10,834
You shall walk for the rest
of eternity without any memory

1395
02:06:10,960 --> 02:06:14,459
of who you are, where you came from,
or those you loved.

1396
02:06:14,584 --> 02:06:18,333
Your innocence, the innocence
we recognized and trusted,

1397
02:06:18,460 --> 02:06:22,084
will be your only guide,
raw and heartless.

1398
02:06:22,210 --> 02:06:23,750
Listen carefully.

1399
02:06:23,877 --> 02:06:26,417
You will feel great loss,

1400
02:06:26,542 --> 02:06:29,250
grief, torture, distress,

1401
02:06:29,375 --> 02:06:32,041
heartache, suffering...

1402
02:06:45,668 --> 02:06:48,917
Stop!
He can still help us!

1403
02:06:49,043 --> 02:06:50,708
This won't accomplish anything!

1404
02:06:52,835 --> 02:06:54,624
Let him be!

1405
02:07:01,417 --> 02:07:11,250
Peter.

1406
02:07:11,376 --> 02:07:13,790
Peter, are you all right?

1407
02:07:15,375 --> 02:07:18,332
The alchemist
has given you a great power,

1408
02:07:18,459 --> 02:07:20,915
and you use it on your own kind.

1409
02:07:21,040 --> 02:07:22,707
I'm sorry.

1410
02:07:22,833 --> 02:07:24,874
When I get angry,
I can't control it.

1411
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:27,166
You have broken a sacred covenant,

1412
02:07:27,292 --> 02:07:29,916
and are no longer welcome
amongst us.

1413
02:07:31,042 --> 02:07:33,584
Peter. Was I too late?

1414
02:07:34,375 --> 02:07:36,291
Peter!

1415
02:08:22,374 --> 02:08:23,832
Tinker Bell.

1416
02:08:48,624 --> 02:08:49,956
Oh...

1417
02:09:39,331 --> 02:09:42,206
Ha ha ha! Gibberish,
gibberish, gibberish!

1418
02:09:42,332 --> 02:09:45,080
I can speak gibberish too,
you know?

1419
02:09:45,206 --> 02:09:48,581
- Peter, are you all right?
- Never better.

1420
02:09:48,707 --> 02:09:51,830
Who are your friends?
Why are you in fancy dress?

1421
02:09:51,956 --> 02:09:53,164
Is there a party?

1422
02:09:53,290 --> 02:09:55,290
-
- Hey!

1423
02:09:57,039 --> 02:09:58,081
Let go of me!

1424
02:10:14,998 --> 02:10:16,997
How many?

1425
02:10:17,123 --> 02:10:20,747
Another two dead
and three wounded.

1426
02:10:31,706 --> 02:10:34,205
This is your doing, Hook.

1427
02:10:35,706 --> 02:10:40,372
We have been on a slippery slope
ever since you have appeared.

1428
02:10:41,372 --> 02:10:44,456
And I have watched you

1429
02:10:44,582 --> 02:10:48,829
while you have dragged us
in every direction...

1430
02:10:48,955 --> 02:10:50,955
except the right one.

1431
02:10:52,539 --> 02:10:54,997
Sent some of our best men

1432
02:10:55,123 --> 02:10:57,121
to their deaths.

1433
02:10:58,998 --> 02:11:00,997
What is that thing you say?

1434
02:11:01,123 --> 02:11:05,913
"Smaller is sometimes
smarter," yes?

1435
02:11:07,165 --> 02:11:10,327
I think it's time
we tested this theory.

1436
02:11:10,455 --> 02:11:12,369
You see, without you,

1437
02:11:12,495 --> 02:11:14,745
we are a smaller group.

1438
02:11:14,872 --> 02:11:17,829
But much, much smarter.

1439
02:11:24,038 --> 02:11:26,204
I have two shots...

1440
02:11:27,497 --> 02:11:30,704
and there are five of you.
Who will it be?

1441
02:11:30,830 --> 02:11:32,537
How about you, Starkey?

1442
02:11:32,663 --> 02:11:34,412
You could take me...

1443
02:11:35,746 --> 02:11:37,661
if you had the guts.

1444
02:11:42,871 --> 02:11:45,704
Just because it didn't
turn out how we wanted

1445
02:11:45,829 --> 02:11:47,954
doesn't mean we have to give up.

1446
02:11:50,454 --> 02:11:52,537
I could get more men here in days,

1447
02:11:52,663 --> 02:11:55,828
heavily armed with Gatling guns
and grenades

1448
02:11:55,954 --> 02:11:57,579
and fire in their hearts!

1449
02:11:57,704 --> 02:12:00,704
Fifty, a hundred,
perhaps a thousand!

1450
02:12:04,788 --> 02:12:07,412
We can overrun the Indians

1451
02:12:07,538 --> 02:12:11,953
and force the tree spirits
to give up the secret of the mineral dust.

1452
02:12:12,079 --> 02:12:16,121
And where will you get
these men from?

1453
02:12:16,247 --> 02:12:19,954
I'll go back to London.
Recruit them from the streets.

1454
02:12:20,080 --> 02:12:22,744
Believe me, there are many
who would give their right arm

1455
02:12:22,871 --> 02:12:24,702
to be shot of
the London gutter forever.

1456
02:12:24,829 --> 02:12:27,286
No, no, no, no, you're not
listening to this, are you, men?

1457
02:12:27,412 --> 02:12:31,828
You don't fall for this again?
This is just more of his...ehh...lies!

1458
02:12:31,954 --> 02:12:35,743
If we let him out of our sight,
you will never see him again.

1459
02:12:47,079 --> 02:12:48,577
So come with me.

1460
02:12:50,120 --> 02:12:51,536
Eh?

1461
02:12:51,662 --> 02:12:54,077
He's the only one who knows

1462
02:12:54,204 --> 02:12:56,618
where the alchemist's orb is.

1463
02:12:57,579 --> 02:12:59,870
And how to get us back from London.

1464
02:13:03,871 --> 02:13:05,786
Join me, Starkey.

1465
02:13:07,871 --> 02:13:12,660
Come see what pleasures
the modern world has to offer.

1466
02:13:15,869 --> 02:13:18,995
Believe me, you won't
be disappointed.

1467
02:13:26,036 --> 02:13:28,536
We can't just leave him down there.

1468
02:13:29,704 --> 02:13:32,578
Say we do get him out.

1469
02:13:32,703 --> 02:13:35,743
What then?
Run for the hills?

1470
02:13:35,870 --> 02:13:37,411
Live in the wild?

1471
02:13:37,537 --> 02:13:40,785
- We'd starve.
- Peter wouldn't let that happen.

1472
02:13:40,911 --> 02:13:45,326
Peter's ga-ga. He-He lost his marbles
so they threw him in the pit.

1473
02:13:45,453 --> 02:13:47,244
And he's a traitor.

1474
02:13:47,370 --> 02:13:49,326
He led the pirates
through the mountain passage.

1475
02:13:49,453 --> 02:13:53,411
The Indians know
what they're doing, Toots.

1476
02:13:55,703 --> 02:13:58,493
Three months back,

1477
02:13:58,618 --> 02:14:02,577
Tom McKenna and his gang had me
trapped down a blind alley.

1478
02:14:02,703 --> 02:14:05,701
There was four of them
and only one of me.

1479
02:14:05,827 --> 02:14:08,202
And they had knives.

1480
02:14:08,327 --> 02:14:12,077
"Let's make him suffer,"
said Tom.

1481
02:14:12,203 --> 02:14:15,286
I knew I was dead.

1482
02:14:15,411 --> 02:14:17,577
I started whistling
our S.O.S. song.

1483
02:14:17,703 --> 02:14:19,741
You know, the Marseillaise.

1484
02:14:19,868 --> 02:14:23,452
I didn't think any of you
would hear me, but...then...

1485
02:14:24,743 --> 02:14:27,118
out of nowhere,
Peter appeared.

1486
02:14:28,285 --> 02:14:30,784
"We're in luck, lads," says Tom.

1487
02:14:30,910 --> 02:14:33,076
"Two for the price of one."

1488
02:14:33,202 --> 02:14:35,077
And...

1489
02:14:35,203 --> 02:14:38,411
I looked at Peter,
and he smiled back.

1490
02:14:38,536 --> 02:14:41,869
No fear, nothing--

1491
02:14:41,995 --> 02:14:44,034
just that cocky smile.

1492
02:14:45,035 --> 02:14:47,617
"Go ahead," he says. "Try it.

1493
02:14:47,743 --> 02:14:50,076
"And tomorrow fifty snipes
just like us will come

1494
02:14:50,202 --> 02:14:52,409
"looking for you."

1495
02:14:52,535 --> 02:14:54,452
I didn't know about that.

1496
02:14:55,785 --> 02:14:57,243
Peter kept it quiet.

1497
02:14:59,119 --> 02:15:00,660
Didn't want to show me up.

1498
02:15:02,661 --> 02:15:05,785
Look, we survived the streets
because we stuck together,

1499
02:15:05,911 --> 02:15:07,950
and we looked out for each other
even when the odds

1500
02:15:08,076 --> 02:15:09,908
were stacked against us.

1501
02:15:10,034 --> 02:15:12,783
I thought the rules might work
different here...

1502
02:15:14,703 --> 02:15:16,701
but they don't.

1503
02:15:27,368 --> 02:15:28,743
Peter.

1504
02:15:32,200 --> 02:15:33,534
Get off!

1505
02:15:33,660 --> 02:15:35,033
Get off me!

1506
02:15:49,784 --> 02:15:50,783
Peter, it's us.

1507
02:15:50,909 --> 02:15:52,660
Who are you ugly mugs?

1508
02:15:52,786 --> 02:15:55,033
Hold on,
I'll throw you a rope.

1509
02:16:01,784 --> 02:16:03,908
You can fly?

1510
02:16:05,950 --> 02:16:08,325
What do you want with me,
Indians?

1511
02:16:08,451 --> 02:16:10,284
Come on, Peter,
we've got to get out of here.

1512
02:16:10,410 --> 02:16:13,410
I'm not going anywhere
until you tell me who you are.

1513
02:16:17,533 --> 02:16:20,032
Hey! Get off me!

1514
02:16:20,159 --> 02:16:22,200
- Oi!
- Hold him down!

1515
02:16:31,742 --> 02:16:34,242
Let's try this one more time.

1516
02:16:34,367 --> 02:16:37,741
Your name's Peter.
You grew up in the East End,

1517
02:16:37,868 --> 02:16:39,992
and you're the best set-up man
on the street.

1518
02:16:40,118 --> 02:16:43,575
If you don't let me go,
my people will come looking for you.

1519
02:16:43,701 --> 02:16:46,199
He thinks he's a flipping tree spirit.

1520
02:16:46,325 --> 02:16:48,907
Do tree spirits speak English?

1521
02:16:49,033 --> 02:16:50,365
Untie me!

1522
02:16:50,491 --> 02:16:52,491
I knew this was a bad idea.

1523
02:18:07,365 --> 02:18:09,323
Hello, Peter.

1524
02:18:09,450 --> 02:18:11,241
I see you've all gone native.

1525
02:18:11,366 --> 02:18:12,574
Peter!

1526
02:18:12,700 --> 02:18:13,699
Welcome back!

1527
02:18:13,824 --> 02:18:15,948
Hurry, lads!
We've got work to do.

1528
02:18:26,574 --> 02:18:28,907
We thought it'd be safer higher up.

1529
02:18:29,033 --> 02:18:30,657
Where's Aaya?

1530
02:18:30,782 --> 02:18:34,614
Home. In the village.
Don't you remember?

1531
02:18:34,741 --> 02:18:37,949
She tried to stand up for you,
but they were too angry.

1532
02:18:38,075 --> 02:18:39,738
What do we do now, Peter?

1533
02:18:42,031 --> 02:18:46,281
You can't get over these mountains,
there's nothing but ice and rock up there.

1534
02:18:46,407 --> 02:18:49,698
And you can't go back down
into the forest, so...

1535
02:18:49,824 --> 02:18:51,156
you're gonna have to sit tight.

1536
02:18:51,282 --> 02:18:52,865
And you?

1537
02:18:52,990 --> 02:18:56,656
You know that glass orb
Jimmy found in Harbottle's?

1538
02:18:56,782 --> 02:18:59,698
There's one just like it here,
and it can get us all home.

1539
02:18:59,824 --> 02:19:01,030
Where is it?

1540
02:19:01,157 --> 02:19:02,406
That's the bad news.

1541
02:19:02,532 --> 02:19:05,072
Jimmy hid it in some caves
in Bull Island.

1542
02:19:05,197 --> 02:19:07,824
But I'm gonna find it
and bring it here.

1543
02:19:07,949 --> 02:19:08,948
How?

1544
02:19:39,489 --> 02:19:42,821
- What are you doing here?
- I was going to ask you the same question.

1545
02:19:42,947 --> 02:19:45,737
Who, Hook?

1546
02:19:45,864 --> 02:19:49,031
I don't have to. I'll be shadowing him
the whole way.

1547
02:19:49,158 --> 02:19:53,405
What if he can't press-gang
an army off the streets like he says he can?

1548
02:19:53,531 --> 02:19:55,904
Then we come home without him.

1549
02:19:56,031 --> 02:19:58,655
Once we've passed
this peninsula,

1550
02:19:58,781 --> 02:20:00,238
Bull Island should be straight ahead.

1551
02:20:00,364 --> 02:20:01,363
SÃ¬.

1552
02:20:01,489 --> 02:20:03,488
They're going to the orb,
Peter.

1553
02:20:03,614 --> 02:20:05,530
If we sit tight,
they'll take us right to it.

1554
02:20:05,656 --> 02:20:07,864
Then what? Snatch it
from under their noses?

1555
02:20:07,990 --> 02:20:10,156
No! We wait for them to use it.

1556
02:20:10,282 --> 02:20:12,030
Once they're gone,
the orb will be ours.

1557
02:20:12,157 --> 02:20:14,863
But then they'll come back to Neverland
with an army and wipe out the Indians.

1558
02:20:14,989 --> 02:20:17,820
If we can deliver the orb to the grand elders,
they might forgive us.

1559
02:20:17,946 --> 02:20:19,571
But what about the Indians?

1560
02:20:19,697 --> 02:20:22,780
The elders will use the orb
to get rid of the pirates.

1561
02:20:25,448 --> 02:20:29,071
And imagine,
if he can do what he says he can,

1562
02:20:29,197 --> 02:20:32,822
and we show up
with a thousand men and them guns,

1563
02:20:32,948 --> 02:20:36,405
and bombs and all----

1564
02:20:36,531 --> 02:20:38,237
the Indians won't know what hit 'em.

1565
02:20:42,655 --> 02:20:44,446
I have to warn them.

1566
02:20:50,738 --> 02:20:52,154
Peter!

1567
02:21:02,696 --> 02:21:04,279
- Aaya.
-

1568
02:21:07,280 --> 02:21:09,196
Hook and the pirates
are planning to use Fludd's orb

1569
02:21:09,321 --> 02:21:12,946
to bring an army to Neverland
and... wipe you out.

1570
02:21:13,072 --> 02:21:16,737
So...was it all an act?

1571
02:21:16,864 --> 02:21:18,737
You playing a fool?

1572
02:21:18,864 --> 02:21:20,196
Of course not.

1573
02:21:20,322 --> 02:21:22,779
And what about leading the pirates
to the mountain pass?

1574
02:21:22,904 --> 02:21:24,695
Was that you?

1575
02:21:27,195 --> 02:21:28,487
They tricked me.

1576
02:21:28,612 --> 02:21:29,695
Really?

1577
02:21:31,195 --> 02:21:32,777
How?

1578
02:21:32,904 --> 02:21:36,529
Listen, we don't have much time.
They're on their way to Bull Island now.

1579
02:21:36,655 --> 02:21:39,861
You've got to get everyone together
and stop them before they get there.

1580
02:21:39,987 --> 02:21:42,237
I'll try and stall them
somehow, but...

1581
02:21:42,363 --> 02:21:44,072
I can't fight them on my own.

1582
02:21:44,198 --> 02:21:46,989
Fight them? Why would you
want to fight them?

1583
02:21:47,114 --> 02:21:48,903
I thought you were with them.

1584
02:21:49,029 --> 02:21:52,028
Did you really think that
we'd get in our boats

1585
02:21:52,155 --> 02:21:53,571
and go out into the ocean

1586
02:21:53,697 --> 02:21:56,903
so you and your friends could have
a little target practice?

1587
02:21:57,029 --> 02:21:59,528
You really think
I'd do that to you?

1588
02:22:36,278 --> 02:22:39,361
- What happened?
- We're on our own.

1589
02:22:39,487 --> 02:22:41,527
We'll do it your way.

1590
02:22:45,446 --> 02:22:49,527
No, no, no,
only as much as they can carry.

1591
02:22:49,653 --> 02:22:52,610
I thought it was just
you and me, Starkey.

1592
02:22:54,820 --> 02:22:56,485
Then you tell them yourself.

1593
02:22:56,611 --> 02:23:00,068
There's not a man here
who doesn't want to visit home.

1594
02:23:00,193 --> 02:23:02,610
What if the Indians take the ship
while we're gone?

1595
02:23:02,736 --> 02:23:05,610
We'll have nothing to come back to.

1596
02:23:05,736 --> 02:23:10,819
Look, once we have control
of Fludd's London orb,

1597
02:23:10,945 --> 02:23:12,861
we can come back and forth
as we please.

1598
02:23:12,987 --> 02:23:16,153
Everyone will have their turn.
Including you, Mr. Smee.

1599
02:23:16,279 --> 02:23:19,361
- I'm not staying!
- And I'm not leaving anyone else in charge.

1600
02:23:19,486 --> 02:23:22,610
- Oh, leave--
- Look. I'll bring you back a little treat, okay?

1601
02:23:22,735 --> 02:23:25,651
Some--A nice bottle
of rumbullion, perhaps.

1602
02:23:25,777 --> 02:23:27,193
And an Eccles cake.

1603
02:23:27,319 --> 02:23:29,152
A whole sack.

1604
02:23:29,278 --> 02:23:31,026
You're on.

1605
02:23:32,735 --> 02:23:34,901
But I'm not going alone, Hook.

1606
02:23:35,027 --> 02:23:36,277
Pensi che sia stupido?

1607
02:23:36,403 --> 02:23:39,902
You might know what we will
find there--I do not.

1608
02:23:40,028 --> 02:23:42,902
Half a dozen men only,
you understand?

1609
02:23:43,028 --> 02:23:44,945
I don't care how
you choose them, Starkey,

1610
02:23:45,070 --> 02:23:48,484
but any more,
we'll be too conspicuous.

1611
02:23:48,610 --> 02:23:50,609
Va bene.

1612
02:23:57,277 --> 02:23:58,527
Hear that?

1613
02:23:58,652 --> 02:24:01,109
- Hear what?
- That.

1614
02:24:11,861 --> 02:24:13,818
Aaaaah!

1615
02:24:15,694 --> 02:24:18,525
Get off me! Get off!

1616
02:24:36,485 --> 02:24:38,360
What is Peter doing?

1617
02:24:40,901 --> 02:24:43,734
We won't hurt you.
You are our friends.

1618
02:24:43,861 --> 02:24:45,569
But I need to know
what Peter is planning.

1619
02:24:45,694 --> 02:24:47,026
Not a word, Toots.

1620
02:24:47,153 --> 02:24:48,734
He came to me a short time ago,

1621
02:24:48,861 --> 02:24:53,192
told me that the pirates are planning
to bring an army from your world.

1622
02:24:53,318 --> 02:24:56,443
Listen, if Peter is telling the truth,

1623
02:24:56,569 --> 02:24:59,192
we are all in terrible danger.

1624
02:25:00,776 --> 02:25:03,609
He went to find the orb.

1625
02:25:03,735 --> 02:25:05,900
All right? To get us all home.
That's all I know.

1626
02:25:06,026 --> 02:25:07,651
Where?

1627
02:25:07,777 --> 02:25:10,525
The caves on Bull Island.

1628
02:25:55,359 --> 02:25:57,109
Jimmy used to work in the arms trade.

1629
02:25:59,484 --> 02:26:03,150
He's got a mate in the Woolwich arsenal
who can get anything for a price.

1630
02:26:06,025 --> 02:26:07,359
Grenades...

1631
02:26:08,608 --> 02:26:10,691
even poison gas.

1632
02:26:13,192 --> 02:26:16,441
- What is this?
- It's spread by the wind.

1633
02:26:18,901 --> 02:26:20,900
Won't even see it coming.

1634
02:26:22,692 --> 02:26:26,025
It'll choke you to death
before you know it's there.

1635
02:26:45,693 --> 02:26:47,107
We don't take children.

1636
02:26:47,233 --> 02:26:48,941
We can look after ourselves.

1637
02:26:49,066 --> 02:26:50,691
You'll get in the way.

1638
02:26:52,192 --> 02:26:54,065
Then I don't need this.

1639
02:27:07,358 --> 02:27:08,774
Very well.

1640
02:28:10,149 --> 02:28:11,939
Bloody hell.

1641
02:28:15,316 --> 02:28:16,898
All hands on deck!

1642
02:28:17,024 --> 02:28:18,815
Man the cannon!

1643
02:28:25,566 --> 02:28:27,523
Watch your step.

1644
02:28:40,774 --> 02:28:42,356
Fire!

1645
02:29:04,606 --> 02:29:06,605
Oh, mio dio.

1646
02:29:06,731 --> 02:29:08,605
I don't like the look of this.

1647
02:29:41,523 --> 02:29:42,522
Twins!

1648
02:29:58,023 --> 02:30:01,564
Come on!

1649
02:30:48,272 --> 02:30:50,647
All we have to do
is wait until they've gone

1650
02:30:50,773 --> 02:30:52,687
and the orb will be ours.

1651
02:31:08,230 --> 02:31:10,229
Are you ready?

1652
02:31:12,481 --> 02:31:15,353
I'm sorry, Tink.
I can't let this happen.

1653
02:31:15,479 --> 02:31:16,895
What?

1654
02:31:22,563 --> 02:31:24,354
Oh--oh--aaah!

1655
02:31:27,937 --> 02:31:30,855
You've interfered
one time too many.

1656
02:31:52,938 --> 02:31:56,062
Help! Help me!

1657
02:31:56,188 --> 02:31:57,687
Pull!

1658
02:32:12,354 --> 02:32:14,061
Give me that.

1659
02:32:15,438 --> 02:32:17,104
Hold still.

1660
02:32:20,688 --> 02:32:22,228
Ohh! Unhh!

1661
02:32:52,353 --> 02:32:53,561
Where's Hook?!

1662
02:32:53,687 --> 02:32:56,310
They're long gone.
You're too late, Indian.

1663
02:32:56,437 --> 02:32:59,436
And when they get back,
you're all dead.

1664
02:33:28,520 --> 02:33:31,519
Hook's not on the ship.
They're already in the caves!

1665
02:33:31,645 --> 02:33:33,644
Look for tracks!

1666
02:33:43,019 --> 02:33:46,643
Where are you, you little rat?

1667
02:33:58,270 --> 02:34:00,560
We're wasting time.

1668
02:34:00,685 --> 02:34:03,933
Let them fight on
in the streets of London.

1669
02:34:04,059 --> 02:34:05,935
No!

1670
02:34:15,727 --> 02:34:17,768
Where has he gone?

1671
02:34:20,519 --> 02:34:22,185
Over there.

1672
02:34:32,185 --> 02:34:34,642
Hold your fire!
The cave's not safe!

1673
02:34:40,601 --> 02:34:43,600
Come on, Hook.
Let's leave him and go.

1674
02:34:43,726 --> 02:34:47,310
Not until we've dealt with Peter.
Otherwise we leave the orb in his hands.

1675
02:34:47,436 --> 02:34:49,724
The tracks lead this way.

1676
02:34:49,852 --> 02:34:51,351
Hurry!

1677
02:35:23,309 --> 02:35:25,768
It looks like they went this way!

1678
02:35:31,185 --> 02:35:33,517
Hold your fire! He's mine.

1679
02:35:42,852 --> 02:35:44,434
Hold him still!

1680
02:35:47,226 --> 02:35:49,641
No, Tink! Get out of there!

1681
02:35:56,643 --> 02:35:59,099
-
- Vermin.

1682
02:36:03,684 --> 02:36:05,391
Here he comes.

1683
02:36:13,183 --> 02:36:15,434
In here! Hide! Hide!

1684
02:36:19,268 --> 02:36:20,516
Hey!

1685
02:36:22,475 --> 02:36:24,598
Over there! On the ledge!

1686
02:36:53,683 --> 02:36:55,057
Tink?

1687
02:36:56,766 --> 02:36:59,682
We shouldn't fight, Peter.
This is silly.

1688
02:37:01,599 --> 02:37:05,724
Call off the Indians and the lads
so we can join forces.

1689
02:37:05,851 --> 02:37:08,349
We were...a team once.

1690
02:37:08,475 --> 02:37:11,390
We can join forces again,
only this time it'll be different,

1691
02:37:11,516 --> 02:37:13,348
this time we'll be partners.

1692
02:37:14,723 --> 02:37:17,014
Isn't that what you always wanted?

1693
02:37:19,099 --> 02:37:21,391
Stand with me, Peter--

1694
02:37:21,517 --> 02:37:23,724
as my equal, my friend,

1695
02:37:23,851 --> 02:37:26,724
and together we'll rule over London.

1696
02:37:27,851 --> 02:37:29,558
Peter.

1697
02:37:29,684 --> 02:37:31,682
Take my hand, Peter.

1698
02:37:39,182 --> 02:37:42,265
You killed my father.

1699
02:37:44,349 --> 02:37:46,057
And you lied to me

1700
02:37:46,182 --> 02:37:48,349
my whole life!

1701
02:37:56,598 --> 02:37:59,056
Be careful!
You might hit Peter!

1702
02:38:02,349 --> 02:38:06,141
- Come back down to earth.
- Down to your level!

1703
02:38:06,267 --> 02:38:09,764
I'm gonna beat you
without any help!

1704
02:38:17,683 --> 02:38:18,931
Be careful!

1705
02:38:21,722 --> 02:38:22,722
Quick!

1706
02:38:34,474 --> 02:38:35,848
Curly, look out!

1707
02:38:39,516 --> 02:38:41,223
Aaaaah!

1708
02:38:55,015 --> 02:38:57,140
Arrghhhh!

1709
02:38:58,597 --> 02:39:00,763
Ohhh! Ohhh!

1710
02:39:21,683 --> 02:39:23,681
Finish me off.

1711
02:39:25,890 --> 02:39:28,222
No. I'm not like you.

1712
02:39:29,557 --> 02:39:31,471
Come on!

1713
02:39:31,597 --> 02:39:33,388
Be a man!

1714
02:39:36,305 --> 02:39:37,763
Never.

1715
02:39:39,889 --> 02:39:42,097
My father's watch.

1716
02:39:56,012 --> 02:39:58,138
Oh, Peter!

1717
02:40:00,681 --> 02:40:02,596
Peter!

1718
02:40:10,431 --> 02:40:12,722
Enough of this.
Out of my way!

1719
02:40:14,931 --> 02:40:16,513
- No!
- Unhh!

1720
02:40:32,972 --> 02:40:34,387
Ahhh!

1721
02:40:37,056 --> 02:40:39,389
Run! It's coming down!

1722
02:40:39,514 --> 02:40:42,013
-  Go!

1723
02:41:01,263 --> 02:41:03,679
Peter!
You've got to get out!

1724
02:41:09,471 --> 02:41:10,469
Tink?

1725
02:41:33,513 --> 02:41:34,845
Run!

1726
02:41:37,555 --> 02:41:39,512
Run! Get out of here!

1727
02:41:51,846 --> 02:41:53,677
Come on, Peter.

1728
02:42:00,095 --> 02:42:02,095
Where's Peter?

1729
02:43:28,010 --> 02:43:30,009
It landed in the water...

1730
02:43:32,011 --> 02:43:33,635
...I think.

1731
02:43:36,678 --> 02:43:39,802
We have to jump.
It's our only chance.

1732
02:43:44,511 --> 02:43:45,801
Hmmm.

1733
02:43:47,553 --> 02:43:49,009
Hmm.

1734
02:43:50,886 --> 02:43:52,384
So, my friend...

1735
02:43:56,344 --> 02:43:58,677
...if we get out of this alive,

1736
02:43:58,803 --> 02:44:02,677
what will you use for a hand,
Hook?

1737
02:44:19,635 --> 02:44:20,925
What?

1738
02:44:21,051 --> 02:44:24,300
Is this our home
for the rest of eternity?

1739
02:44:24,427 --> 02:44:26,175
What will we do with ourselves?

1740
02:44:27,677 --> 02:44:30,510
A gift for your bravery.

1741
02:44:30,636 --> 02:44:34,094
Paddles! Thanks.
I've always wanted one of these.

1742
02:44:34,219 --> 02:44:37,051
Not just a paddle,
Twins.

1743
02:44:37,177 --> 02:44:39,759
There's a canoe to go with them.

1744
02:44:39,885 --> 02:44:42,550
Now that the last of the pirates
have been banished

1745
02:44:42,676 --> 02:44:45,385
to the Outer Islands,
the sea is safe.

1746
02:44:45,511 --> 02:44:47,551
Thank you, Aaya.

1747
02:44:50,510 --> 02:44:52,259
What's that noise?

1748
02:44:52,385 --> 02:44:55,135
S-Sounds like--

1749
02:44:58,844 --> 02:45:01,216
Peter!

1750
02:45:01,342 --> 02:45:02,342
Oh!

1751
02:45:02,468 --> 02:45:04,882
Hello, lads!

1752
02:45:05,008 --> 02:45:08,383
- How did you get out the cave?
- The orb took a bit of a knock.

1753
02:45:08,509 --> 02:45:12,300
- You went back to London?
- Yep. And I got you all something.

1754
02:45:19,343 --> 02:45:22,051
One of them newfangled
pen knives for you, Slightly.

1755
02:45:22,176 --> 02:45:25,384
The Arabian Nights for Mr. Toots.

1756
02:45:26,592 --> 02:45:29,258
A Greenwich mountain compass
for you, Nibs.

1757
02:45:31,008 --> 02:45:32,716
Curly...

1758
02:45:32,843 --> 02:45:34,842
harmonica.

1759
02:45:37,134 --> 02:45:41,258
And Foxton's Pocket Encyclopedia
for you, Twins.

1760
02:45:41,384 --> 02:45:43,550
Two copies.

1761
02:45:43,676 --> 02:45:45,217
And new shoes for everyone.

1762
02:45:47,759 --> 02:45:49,008
And the orb?

1763
02:45:49,135 --> 02:45:51,550
Buried under a thousand tons
of earth, I expect.

1764
02:45:51,676 --> 02:45:53,216
How did you get back, then?

1765
02:45:53,341 --> 02:45:55,383
I paid a visit to Fludd's friends.

1766
02:45:55,509 --> 02:45:57,384
When they weren't looking,
I borrowed their orb,

1767
02:45:57,509 --> 02:46:00,467
and, er, hid it in a part of London
no one would ever think to look.

1768
02:46:00,592 --> 02:46:01,966
Why, Peter?

1769
02:46:05,385 --> 02:46:07,632
Because I promised a friend
I'd keep the aliens away.

1770
02:46:07,759 --> 02:46:10,008
But why did you come back?

1771
02:46:10,134 --> 02:46:11,841
Now you're stuck here.

1772
02:46:11,967 --> 02:46:15,298
I wasn't gonna leave you snipes
to have all the fun without me.

1773
02:46:15,425 --> 02:46:17,090
What fun?

1774
02:46:17,216 --> 02:46:18,841
Are you mad?

1775
02:46:18,967 --> 02:46:21,882
Neverland is filled with adventures.
We haven't even scratched the surface.

1776
02:46:22,007 --> 02:46:25,674
There's a million islands, with a different
adventure on each and every one.

1777
02:46:25,800 --> 02:46:28,966
And d'you know what the best part is?
We never have to grow up.

1778
02:46:29,092 --> 02:46:31,467
We can do whatever we like,
live by our rules,

1779
02:46:31,593 --> 02:46:33,258
with no adults here to cheat us.

1780
02:46:33,384 --> 02:46:36,216
This is our world,
pure and fair.

1781
02:46:36,342 --> 02:46:38,425
Now, I'm going off
to look for a secret camp.

1782
02:46:38,551 --> 02:46:40,841
All who's with me,
raise your right hand

1783
02:46:40,967 --> 02:46:42,048
and shout, "Neverland!"

1784
02:46:42,174 --> 02:46:44,425
Neverland!

1785
02:46:44,551 --> 02:46:46,382
Peter...

1786
02:46:46,508 --> 02:46:48,507
look.

1787
02:46:48,633 --> 02:46:50,549
Where's your shadow?

1788
02:46:51,305 --> 02:47:51,772
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
