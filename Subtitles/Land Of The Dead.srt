2
00:01:01,835 --> 00:01:03,427
... dead people...

3
00:01:03,503 --> 00:01:05,528
... the recently departed...

4
00:01:05,605 --> 00:01:08,129
Unburied human corpses
are returning to life...

5
00:01:08,207 --> 00:01:09,572
and feeding on the living.

6
00:01:09,641 --> 00:01:10,699
Stay inside.

7
00:01:10,776 --> 00:01:12,437
Do not try
to leave your homes.

8
00:01:12,511 --> 00:01:14,843
They seem to survive
by eating human flesh.

9
00:01:14,913 --> 00:01:17,108
Everyone who dies
will become one of them.

10
00:01:17,182 --> 00:01:19,308
If you are bitten, you will just become
one of them...

11
00:01:19,384 --> 00:01:21,045
that much sooner.

12
00:01:22,153 --> 00:01:25,452
They're not your neighbors
and friends, not anymore.

13
00:01:25,523 --> 00:01:27,013
My wife had a heart attack.

14
00:01:27,091 --> 00:01:29,058
Got up and came after me
like a banshee from hell.

15
00:01:29,126 --> 00:01:30,923
I put a curling iron
through her head.

16
00:01:30,994 --> 00:01:33,087
... - the head...
-  ... the brain...

17
00:01:33,163 --> 00:01:35,154
They must be destroyed
as quickly as possible.

18
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:37,291
There's no time
for funeral arrangements.

19
00:01:37,367 --> 00:01:38,994
There's no time
to dig up holes...

20
00:01:39,069 --> 00:01:40,695
so you can drop these things
in the ground.

21
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:41,964
As long as we're alive...

22
00:01:42,037 --> 00:01:43,470
they ain't never gonna
run out of food.

23
00:01:43,539 --> 00:01:46,804
The day they do, it'll mean only one thing:
We're all dead.

24
00:01:46,976 --> 00:01:49,877
This is not only a local
or a regional phenomenon.

25
00:01:49,945 --> 00:01:51,707
Cities are under siege.

26
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,241
If these creatures ever
develop the power to think...

27
00:01:58,319 --> 00:01:59,343
to reason...

28
00:01:59,421 --> 00:02:01,753
even in the most
primitive way...

29
00:02:01,823 --> 00:02:03,813
People are said
to be establishing...

30
00:02:03,891 --> 00:02:05,051
outposts in big cities...

31
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:08,925
and raiding small rural towns
for supplies, like outlaws.

32
00:03:29,236 --> 00:03:30,863
They're trying to be us.

33
00:03:30,937 --> 00:03:32,768
No, they used to be us.

34
00:03:32,839 --> 00:03:34,829
Learning how to be us again.

35
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:39,273
No way. Some germ or some devil
got those things up and walking...

36
00:03:39,345 --> 00:03:42,246
but there's a big difference
between us and them.

37
00:03:43,215 --> 00:03:44,705
They're dead.

38
00:03:47,886 --> 00:03:49,911
It's like they're pretending
to be alive.

39
00:03:49,988 --> 00:03:53,321
Isn't that what we're doing,
pretending to be alive?

40
00:03:57,561 --> 00:03:59,426
He knows we're here.

41
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,833
Christ.

42
00:04:05,202 --> 00:04:07,533
It's like he's
talking to them.

43
00:04:11,173 --> 00:04:12,470
Let's go.

44
00:04:34,194 --> 00:04:37,357
A whole lot of trash this
week. That's life, bro.

45
00:04:37,431 --> 00:04:40,264
Whole lot of trash, trick
is not to get in with it.

46
00:04:58,584 --> 00:05:01,678
You any good with that, kid? Because
I'm real good with mine.

47
00:05:01,753 --> 00:05:04,846
Put it away, Charlie.
Don't be so jumpy, kid.

48
00:05:05,856 --> 00:05:07,050
What are you doing?

49
00:05:07,124 --> 00:05:09,888
Watching your back. I don't
like it when you go off without me.

50
00:05:09,961 --> 00:05:12,191
I told you to get things
ready. I got things ready...

51
00:05:12,263 --> 00:05:14,595
then I come
to watch your back.

52
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,556
Christ! This is like
a bad dream.

53
00:05:17,634 --> 00:05:18,931
I have bad dreams.

54
00:05:19,202 --> 00:05:21,932
Hell, yes. Just look at me, you
can tell I have terrible dreams.

55
00:05:22,005 --> 00:05:23,734
Riley, what's your 20?

56
00:05:23,807 --> 00:05:24,865
We checked out the town.

57
00:05:24,941 --> 00:05:27,636
There's plenty of supplies, but
a lot of walkers. Where's Cholo?

58
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:29,575
He dumped the trash,
and he's on his way back.

59
00:05:29,645 --> 00:05:30,942
We're ready to go in.
Okay.

60
00:05:31,013 --> 00:05:33,140
Put some flowers
in the graveyard.

61
00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:39,882
"Flowers in the graveyard."
Why do you call them that, Riley?

62
00:05:39,954 --> 00:05:41,012
I don't get it.

63
00:05:41,089 --> 00:05:44,115
These here flowers ain't
the kind you lay down on the ground.

64
00:05:44,192 --> 00:05:47,389
These here are sky flowers,
way up in heaven.

65
00:05:47,462 --> 00:05:50,430
That's why I love you, Charlie.
Because you still believe in heaven.

66
00:05:50,497 --> 00:05:51,896
Lord, yeah.

67
00:05:54,234 --> 00:05:55,895
I mean, look.

68
00:06:27,331 --> 00:06:28,798
Nice driving.

69
00:06:28,899 --> 00:06:31,925
Riley, looks like God's left
the phone off the hook, huh, baby?

70
00:06:33,003 --> 00:06:35,266
Go get my ride.
Get yours, too.

71
00:06:35,338 --> 00:06:36,930
What's the matter?
You look like shit, man.

72
00:06:37,006 --> 00:06:38,234
Didn't I tell you
not to bang chicks...

73
00:06:38,307 --> 00:06:40,707
with problems worse than you?
When are going to listen me?

74
00:06:40,777 --> 00:06:44,042
You done?
I'm never done, baby. Why?

75
00:06:44,881 --> 00:06:46,347
The town's full of walkers.

76
00:06:46,415 --> 00:06:47,973
Yeah, but every town
is full of walkers.

77
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:50,917
No, these guys are not just walking.
It's like they're communicating.

78
00:06:50,986 --> 00:06:53,250
They're thinking, and
there's something going on.

79
00:06:53,321 --> 00:06:55,255
But they're dumb, Riley.

80
00:06:56,558 --> 00:06:58,889
Well, hell. Dead folks
is near as dumb as me.

81
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:00,927
You learned to make yourself
useful, didn't you?

82
00:07:00,995 --> 00:07:02,326
Yeah.
That's what they're doing.

83
00:07:02,396 --> 00:07:03,488
Make yourself useful.

84
00:07:03,564 --> 00:07:05,691
You don't got one
redeeming defect, do you, son, huh?

85
00:07:05,766 --> 00:07:08,791
I got this! I got this! You
got that? You got that, too.

86
00:07:08,935 --> 00:07:12,336
Come on. Let's get to work before
I forget what it is I do for a living.

87
00:07:12,405 --> 00:07:14,134
Cholo, I'm talking to you.

88
00:07:16,076 --> 00:07:17,976
All right, what?
Things are changing.

89
00:07:18,044 --> 00:07:20,671
Just be careful.
We go in, we do our job...

90
00:07:20,746 --> 00:07:23,044
and we get the fuck
out of there. Everyone alive.

91
00:07:23,115 --> 00:07:25,982
Now, you take command of this unit,
you can run it any way you like.

92
00:07:26,051 --> 00:07:29,612
But tonight, it's my last night
out. I don't want any fuck-ups.

93
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:31,878
So, that's what it's about?

94
00:07:31,956 --> 00:07:34,424
You're not going to dump these
recycled delinquents on me.

95
00:07:34,492 --> 00:07:36,153
I don't want to take command.

96
00:07:36,227 --> 00:07:39,321
Because you know what? Tonight's
my last night, too, baby.

97
00:07:39,964 --> 00:07:42,125
Hey, you. Come here,
you little nose-picker.

98
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,224
You been with Riley all day
painting the town beige?

99
00:07:44,301 --> 00:07:46,201
I'm gonna show you
how it's done. Come on.

100
00:07:46,636 --> 00:07:49,469
What'd he do,
win the lottery or something?

101
00:07:51,141 --> 00:07:52,506
Something.

102
00:07:54,977 --> 00:07:57,138
How come you guys
always go out at night?

103
00:07:57,213 --> 00:07:58,737
Wouldn't it be safer
in the daytime?

104
00:08:00,116 --> 00:08:03,347
Fireworks, kid. Stenches
can't keep their eyes off them.

105
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,244
Come on!

106
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:36,271
Yeah!

107
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:00,664
That sucker's mine, baby.

108
00:09:03,139 --> 00:09:04,401
I got that one.

109
00:09:53,352 --> 00:09:57,220
Number 1, how's the food?
Mostly canned stuff.

110
00:09:57,489 --> 00:09:59,615
I'd stay away from the fish.

111
00:10:02,961 --> 00:10:04,553
Number 2,
what's your location?

112
00:10:04,629 --> 00:10:05,687
Drugstore.

113
00:10:05,763 --> 00:10:07,492
Need an aspirin?
I got a million of them.

114
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,658
Antibiotics.
We need antibiotics.

115
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:17,402
They're gone.
The sky flowers, they're gone.

116
00:10:18,342 --> 00:10:20,503
That's not good, is it?
No, it's not good.

117
00:10:39,027 --> 00:10:41,621
Sorry, Riley,
I should have seen that thing.

118
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:43,857
Nice shooting.
That's good shooting, Charlie.

119
00:10:43,964 --> 00:10:45,454
No such thing
as nice shooting.

120
00:10:45,566 --> 00:10:47,124
Pretty Boy,
what the fuck is going on?

121
00:10:47,201 --> 00:10:49,362
Fireworks are jammed.
We're getting on it.

122
00:10:49,436 --> 00:10:50,960
Shut her down!

123
00:10:51,872 --> 00:10:53,100
Everyone, out of town.

124
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,734
Let's move! Go! Drive!

125
00:10:55,842 --> 00:10:57,173
Go!

126
00:11:03,216 --> 00:11:04,240
Two minutes!

127
00:11:04,317 --> 00:11:06,182
Pretty Boy,
lay down some cover.

128
00:11:06,252 --> 00:11:08,378
Get on the guns!

129
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:33,770
I thought this was going to be a
battle. It's a fucking massacre.

130
00:11:52,126 --> 00:11:55,254
Cholo, we got a problem.
Fireworks are down.

131
00:11:55,363 --> 00:11:58,526
It's nice and peaceful,
ain't it? Cholo, where are you?

132
00:11:58,866 --> 00:12:01,357
I'm just getting some
supplies, some essential supplies...

133
00:12:01,436 --> 00:12:03,426
just like my job
description entails.

134
00:12:03,503 --> 00:12:05,767
Nothing in there but booze.
Booze ain't essential.

135
00:12:05,872 --> 00:12:08,705
A jug of good Kentucky
goes for $1,500 back in town.

136
00:12:08,775 --> 00:12:11,073
You've got to
get out of there. Cholo?

137
00:12:12,579 --> 00:12:14,308
God damn it!

138
00:12:37,368 --> 00:12:39,529
All right, Foxy,
shop till you drop, baby.

139
00:12:41,438 --> 00:12:42,462
You know it, brother.

140
00:12:42,539 --> 00:12:44,530
Yeah, 'cause
getting them stinking drunk...

141
00:12:44,608 --> 00:12:46,667
is the only way
you're gonna get laid.

142
00:12:48,345 --> 00:12:51,245
When's the last
time you got laid? I forget.

143
00:12:51,314 --> 00:12:53,839
Fox, I don't care about love.
All I care about is money.

144
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:54,974
That's all I want, baby.

145
00:12:55,651 --> 00:12:56,811
Yes.

146
00:12:58,888 --> 00:13:00,184
Foxy!

147
00:13:02,891 --> 00:13:05,587
I can't
get a shot. Cholo, hold on.

148
00:13:10,232 --> 00:13:12,927
I got him. Cholo, I got him!

149
00:13:27,047 --> 00:13:30,141
Bro, do me a favor, will you?

150
00:13:30,817 --> 00:13:33,217
Next time, just let me
take the fucking shot.

151
00:13:33,353 --> 00:13:36,412
Fucking cowboy.
Stop being a pussy, man.

152
00:13:38,323 --> 00:13:39,881
Yeah, I got what I need.

153
00:13:46,764 --> 00:13:48,664
A little something extra, too.

154
00:13:52,403 --> 00:13:53,700
Nice.

155
00:13:56,174 --> 00:13:57,765
Here, kid, pick that up.

156
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,501
I'm bit.
Yeah, you're bit.

157
00:14:34,575 --> 00:14:36,839
Not gonna leave you here.
Gonna get you out of here, okay?

158
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:39,936
No. I will not become
one of those things.

159
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:42,037
Riley, step aside.

160
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:44,708
No, you put that thing away.
Riley, come on. Step aside.

161
00:14:44,784 --> 00:14:46,911
I said put it away.

162
00:15:13,611 --> 00:15:17,171
This is Riley. Cease fire.
Repeat, cease fire.

163
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,407
Let's pack it up.
We're going to call it a night.

164
00:17:30,836 --> 00:17:32,803
Shit happens, right?

165
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:34,895
Only if you let it, Charlie.

166
00:17:41,212 --> 00:17:43,509
Life goes on
at Fiddler's Green...

167
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:46,640
in the heart of one of America's
oldest and greatest cities.

168
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:49,214
Bordered on three sides
by mighty rivers...

169
00:17:49,286 --> 00:17:52,687
Fiddler's Green offers luxury living
in the grand old style.

170
00:17:53,223 --> 00:17:55,918
Dine at one of
six fine restaurants.

171
00:17:56,292 --> 00:17:58,783
Look for that perfect gift in our fully-stocked
shopping mall.

172
00:17:58,894 --> 00:18:01,089
Man, they sure did
used to make it sound nice.

173
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:02,890
Still sounds nice to me.

174
00:18:02,965 --> 00:18:06,229
There is a difference between
our place and other places.

175
00:18:06,301 --> 00:18:08,064
If you can appreciate
that difference...

176
00:18:08,136 --> 00:18:09,967
You're not
going to be around no more?

177
00:18:10,038 --> 00:18:13,667
You little bitch, you can come up
and party with me any time you want.

178
00:18:16,044 --> 00:18:17,510
I hate going under the river.

179
00:18:18,745 --> 00:18:19,769
Cholo.

180
00:18:19,846 --> 00:18:22,041
Shit. Let's
get out of here, Foxy.

181
00:18:22,115 --> 00:18:23,639
Yeah, man. Back off, Riley.

182
00:18:23,717 --> 00:18:25,776
Just back the fuck off
'cause I am not in the mood.

183
00:18:25,852 --> 00:18:28,411
You think that kid was in the
mood? Look, he knew the risk, man.

184
00:18:28,487 --> 00:18:31,012
He took the job like we all
took the job knowing the risk.

185
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:33,115
Exactly, the job. You know
what the job is, Cholo?

186
00:18:33,192 --> 00:18:35,183
It's to bring things in
that people need.

187
00:18:35,261 --> 00:18:38,424
Not to make a few extra bucks
selling liquor on the street.

188
00:18:38,497 --> 00:18:39,861
What, you're talking
about this?

189
00:18:39,931 --> 00:18:41,956
This is for me and my
new friends, to celebrate.

190
00:18:42,033 --> 00:18:43,898
That's what that's for.

191
00:18:43,968 --> 00:18:46,334
A kid died out there
on the street tonight...

192
00:18:46,404 --> 00:18:48,531
so that you can
fucking celebrate.

193
00:18:49,374 --> 00:18:53,207
Riley, you know what you remind
me of? You remind me of my old man.

194
00:18:54,178 --> 00:18:56,976
A nice guy. I loved him and
all that but he was a dumbass.

195
00:18:57,047 --> 00:18:59,242
Never went for anything,
so he never had anything.

196
00:18:59,316 --> 00:19:02,978
What do you got, Riley? Nothing.
I'm going to have my own place, man.

197
00:19:03,052 --> 00:19:04,747
My own goddamn place.

198
00:19:05,755 --> 00:19:07,746
You're dreaming, Cholo.
They won't let you in there.

199
00:19:07,824 --> 00:19:10,054
They wouldn't let me in there.
We're the wrong kind.

200
00:19:10,126 --> 00:19:11,787
Yeah, well, we'll see.

201
00:19:12,395 --> 00:19:13,884
Isn't it time?

202
00:19:13,995 --> 00:19:17,123
Isn't it your time?
For Fiddler's Green?

203
00:19:32,313 --> 00:19:33,905
DeMora, supplies unit.

204
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:37,513
What's in them boxes?
Essential supplies.

205
00:19:38,752 --> 00:19:40,276
For Kaufman.

206
00:19:45,658 --> 00:19:47,648
Mark your calendars.

207
00:19:47,726 --> 00:19:49,318
Mr. Kaufman
cordially invites...

208
00:19:49,395 --> 00:19:51,386
residents of the Green
to a masked ball...

209
00:19:51,463 --> 00:19:53,055
on the eve of Allhallows.

210
00:19:53,132 --> 00:19:55,930
It is strictly forbidden
to come as you are.

211
00:19:56,001 --> 00:19:57,866
It's expensive. Look at that.

212
00:19:57,936 --> 00:19:58,925
You like it?

213
00:20:00,371 --> 00:20:01,360
I could tell.

214
00:20:17,053 --> 00:20:19,578
Can I ask you to stop, sir?

215
00:20:19,656 --> 00:20:20,918
Quitting time, Deke.

216
00:20:20,991 --> 00:20:22,514
You're going to need this
to get back in.

217
00:20:22,591 --> 00:20:25,321
When I said quitting time,
I meant quitting time.

218
00:20:26,929 --> 00:20:28,226
Hey, baby.

219
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:33,396
"The only way to the Father,
is through me," sayeth the Lord.

220
00:20:33,468 --> 00:20:35,368
So, Riley, you
want to go get a drink?

221
00:20:35,437 --> 00:20:38,736
Just look at me. You can
tell I could use a drink.

222
00:20:39,908 --> 00:20:42,468
You know, Charlie,
why don't you go ahead?

223
00:20:42,544 --> 00:20:44,807
I'll catch up.
Where are you going?

224
00:20:46,647 --> 00:20:48,979
I got to see a man
about a car.

225
00:20:51,485 --> 00:20:52,747
A car?

226
00:21:06,165 --> 00:21:08,394
All right.
Here's the deal.

227
00:21:08,733 --> 00:21:12,601
Rivers protect us on two sides.
Bridges are all blocked up.

228
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,805
The only overland access
is here, called the "Throat."

229
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:17,341
And these fences
go all the way across?

230
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:19,376
Half a mile, both ways.

231
00:21:21,111 --> 00:21:23,238
Stench. High noon.
Shit.

232
00:21:26,517 --> 00:21:28,747
They don't
come around here much anymore.

233
00:21:28,819 --> 00:21:31,412
It's like they've learned
they can't get in.

234
00:21:33,823 --> 00:21:35,882
Take his fucking face off.

235
00:21:44,099 --> 00:21:46,624
How long are you going
to let Kaufman push you around?

236
00:21:46,702 --> 00:21:49,227
You like shining his shoes,
pressing his pants?

237
00:21:49,304 --> 00:21:52,704
He didn't build that place.
He just took it over.

238
00:21:52,773 --> 00:21:56,072
Kept the best for himself, and
left us with a slum to live in.

239
00:21:56,143 --> 00:21:59,271
But if there's enough of us,
if all of you would join up...

240
00:21:59,514 --> 00:22:01,778
we could make this
a fit place to live in.

241
00:22:01,849 --> 00:22:04,180
Dad, look who's here.

242
00:22:04,818 --> 00:22:08,515
Riley Denbo!
I used to work with him.

243
00:22:08,722 --> 00:22:11,384
Bringing in toothpicks for the
bastards to pick at their gums.

244
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:14,325
And food and other stuff,
for all of us.

245
00:22:15,094 --> 00:22:17,221
Come in with us, Riley.
Both of you.

246
00:22:17,496 --> 00:22:19,760
Together we'd be unstoppable.

247
00:22:19,832 --> 00:22:21,925
No one's unstoppable,
Mulligan.

248
00:22:22,001 --> 00:22:24,469
You're worried about being
locked out. Now, you see that?

249
00:22:24,537 --> 00:22:26,697
I can't help but think
we're all locked in.

250
00:22:26,771 --> 00:22:29,399
I'm looking for
a world where there's no fences.

251
00:22:29,841 --> 00:22:33,709
Here. Antibiotics for your boy. Thanks.

252
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:41,447
You all right, Son?
I'm fine, Dad.

253
00:22:53,763 --> 00:22:55,697
Hey, easy, easy, Knipp! Easy.

254
00:22:55,865 --> 00:23:00,097
Mr. DeMora. Mr. Kaufman
isn't home. And I heard...

255
00:23:02,404 --> 00:23:03,530
That.

256
00:23:04,239 --> 00:23:06,639
I called Security.
They should be here.

257
00:23:06,708 --> 00:23:08,198
Yeah, I got it.

258
00:23:29,062 --> 00:23:30,051
Where are you?

259
00:23:42,574 --> 00:23:43,768
Oh, shit.

260
00:23:54,619 --> 00:23:56,587
Oh, God, he killed himself.

261
00:23:56,754 --> 00:23:59,847
All right, lady, I need you to
down, okay? Try to keep it together.

262
00:23:59,956 --> 00:24:02,857
Who are you? Are you Security?
No, I'm not Security.

263
00:24:02,959 --> 00:24:04,950
Then, who the hell are you?

264
00:24:05,061 --> 00:24:08,257
I work for Kaufman. All right, lady,
I just need you to calm down, please.

265
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:10,093
What are you doing with that?

266
00:24:10,165 --> 00:24:12,793
Lady, you know
what I have to do. I'm sorry.

267
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:13,857
Dad!

268
00:24:14,136 --> 00:24:15,865
He's gonna turn, lady.

269
00:24:15,938 --> 00:24:17,371
No, he won't. Please.

270
00:24:17,439 --> 00:24:19,168
No, he's okay. Please,
we don't have a choice.

271
00:24:19,241 --> 00:24:21,333
Don't make this anymore
difficult than it has to be.

272
00:24:21,409 --> 00:24:22,899
He's gonna turn,
don't do this!

273
00:24:26,514 --> 00:24:29,108
What's happening?
Shut up.

274
00:24:38,659 --> 00:24:39,887
Hey, kid.

275
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:56,467
What the hell's going on here?

276
00:25:05,749 --> 00:25:08,616
It's your problem.
Clean it up.

277
00:25:12,189 --> 00:25:13,918
Hey, lady, it's okay.

278
00:25:29,204 --> 00:25:31,365
What did you do to my car?
What car?

279
00:25:31,506 --> 00:25:34,304
The last car I drove out of
this town was three years ago.

280
00:25:34,376 --> 00:25:37,277
No, I bought a car.
It was right there yesterday.

281
00:25:37,345 --> 00:25:38,539
There were two guys
working on it.

282
00:25:38,613 --> 00:25:40,671
There was nobody here
this morning.

283
00:25:41,716 --> 00:25:43,047
Son of a bitch.

284
00:25:43,217 --> 00:25:45,481
What happened, Riley?
Did you get fucked?

285
00:25:45,553 --> 00:25:46,747
Come with me.

286
00:25:48,189 --> 00:25:49,554
You got fucked.

287
00:26:25,355 --> 00:26:27,983
Roach.
Hey, how's it going?

288
00:26:28,158 --> 00:26:29,955
I've been better.
Where's Chihuahua?

289
00:26:30,026 --> 00:26:31,550
Around the back.

290
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:34,724
Come on!

291
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:37,891
Lot of action in here today.
We've got a new kind of game.

292
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,594
What are they betting on?
Black and red.

293
00:26:40,669 --> 00:26:43,001
Who wins the fight.

294
00:26:43,105 --> 00:26:44,572
Stenches don't fight.

295
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,073
They do when there's food.

296
00:26:46,142 --> 00:26:47,733
What's on the menu,
cat or dog?

297
00:26:47,809 --> 00:26:50,300
I told you,
today it's something new.

298
00:26:51,012 --> 00:26:54,345
Who do you want, black
or red? $60 on black.

299
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:30,037
What the fuck happened
to my car?

300
00:27:30,115 --> 00:27:31,639
They're fixing it up.

301
00:27:31,716 --> 00:27:34,616
No, I went to the garage.
There's nothing there.

302
00:27:34,685 --> 00:27:37,153
Your guys aren't there,
and my car is not there.

303
00:27:37,221 --> 00:27:41,317
This is not me. I do not do this
to you. I'm your friend.

304
00:27:41,392 --> 00:27:43,484
Well, be my friend
and get my fucking car back...

305
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:46,688
or I'll have to carry you
out of here inside that fucking hat.

306
00:27:56,171 --> 00:27:58,571
This guy could
be trouble. Keep him busy.

307
00:28:00,475 --> 00:28:02,067
Give a drink.

308
00:28:04,446 --> 00:28:06,208
Let me have my gun.

309
00:28:15,489 --> 00:28:16,922
Supply run last night, huh?

310
00:28:16,991 --> 00:28:18,958
I heard you got some money.
Not interested.

311
00:28:19,025 --> 00:28:21,050
I'll show you how to
turn that money into more...

312
00:28:21,127 --> 00:28:22,321
I said I'm not interested.

313
00:28:37,376 --> 00:28:38,809
Jesus! Fuck!

314
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:09,902
My suit.

315
00:29:10,706 --> 00:29:12,936
He ruined my fucking suit!

316
00:29:52,444 --> 00:29:53,536
Shit.

317
00:29:59,517 --> 00:30:01,041
I'm all right.

318
00:30:06,958 --> 00:30:09,290
Thank you.
Thank you.

319
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:15,654
I've seen you around.

320
00:30:15,732 --> 00:30:18,792
I've seen you around, too,
working the streets.

321
00:30:21,471 --> 00:30:23,461
You were checking me out?

322
00:30:26,275 --> 00:30:27,970
What the hell happened here?

323
00:30:28,043 --> 00:30:31,035
Someone shot the little
fat man. I see that.

324
00:30:31,347 --> 00:30:32,405
You're under arrest.

325
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:41,577
Hey.

326
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:43,714
What?
Why you?

327
00:30:43,791 --> 00:30:47,590
Why'd the little fat man
throw you in there with them things?

328
00:30:48,562 --> 00:30:50,257
Wasn't the little man.

329
00:30:51,999 --> 00:30:53,489
It was the big man.

330
00:30:54,835 --> 00:30:56,131
Mr. K.

331
00:30:56,602 --> 00:30:59,230
He's got his fingers
in everything here.

332
00:30:59,372 --> 00:31:01,897
If you can drink it,
shoot it up...

333
00:31:02,108 --> 00:31:06,807
fuck it, gamble on it,
it belongs to him.

334
00:31:07,779 --> 00:31:09,838
Didn't answer the question.

335
00:31:10,882 --> 00:31:13,282
He asked you why.
I know what he asked me.

336
00:31:18,056 --> 00:31:22,253
They found out I was helping
out Mulligan and his people...

337
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,758
tired of eating bones
while he's having a steak.

338
00:31:25,863 --> 00:31:28,661
Me, too,
but every place is the same.

339
00:31:28,999 --> 00:31:30,761
Places with people.

340
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,498
I'm going to find a place
where there's no people.

341
00:31:33,569 --> 00:31:34,558
North.

342
00:31:34,871 --> 00:31:37,431
Canada.
If you get a way out...

343
00:31:38,674 --> 00:31:42,336
- I'm coming with you.
-  No, Riley likes to be alone.

344
00:31:42,511 --> 00:31:45,537
He might take me,
'cause he says...

345
00:31:45,647 --> 00:31:49,208
having me around is pretty
much the same as being alone.

346
00:31:50,185 --> 00:31:54,644
And 'cause I can make
myself useful, and I can shoot.

347
00:31:54,722 --> 00:31:58,214
I can shoot. I can be
pretty fucking useful.

348
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:03,663
I had training. I was going to
join the army, help the Green...

349
00:32:03,898 --> 00:32:07,128
till somebody figured I'd
be a better hooker than a soldier.

350
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,293
You know, I don't want to hear
your fucking story.

351
00:32:09,369 --> 00:32:13,203
Everyone's got a story,
and I am sick of hearing them.

352
00:32:14,007 --> 00:32:16,031
What's your story, Riley?

353
00:32:17,076 --> 00:32:18,304
I don't have one.

354
00:32:18,377 --> 00:32:22,245
Nothing bad ever happened to
me till everything changed.

355
00:32:24,016 --> 00:32:25,745
Everything changed
for all of us.

356
00:32:34,625 --> 00:32:35,922
Hey, Mulligan.

357
00:32:41,731 --> 00:32:44,996
What they going to do?
Kill him? Not right away.

358
00:32:45,735 --> 00:32:50,034
First they'll try to get him
to talk. About people like me.

359
00:34:15,617 --> 00:34:17,915
Mr. DeMora. Boss.

360
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,417
How was Uniontown?
Dead.

361
00:34:21,422 --> 00:34:24,914
Death intrudes on us even here
in the city, I'm afraid.

362
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:27,286
I heard abut what happened
with my neighbors.

363
00:34:27,361 --> 00:34:28,760
And I'm grateful
for your help.

364
00:34:28,829 --> 00:34:30,353
That's what I'm here for,
boss...

365
00:34:30,431 --> 00:34:32,398
to take care of any problems
you got.

366
00:34:32,465 --> 00:34:35,901
Look, I got you a little present,
a little souvenir from town.

367
00:34:42,575 --> 00:34:44,566
I know you're used to
better vintage than this...

368
00:34:44,643 --> 00:34:45,905
but it's the best we got.

369
00:34:45,978 --> 00:34:48,242
Little champers
to take the edge off things.

370
00:34:50,683 --> 00:34:52,082
There we go.

371
00:34:56,187 --> 00:34:59,520
This is very extravagant.
Yeah, well, I can afford it.

372
00:35:00,792 --> 00:35:02,953
With the $20,000 you owe me
from last night...

373
00:35:03,027 --> 00:35:05,086
and the money from all
the other nights together...

374
00:35:05,163 --> 00:35:07,096
I got enough for my own place.

375
00:35:07,497 --> 00:35:10,398
You mean here in the Green?
Sure, why not?

376
00:35:13,103 --> 00:35:15,037
I'm sorry, Mr. DeMora...

377
00:35:16,839 --> 00:35:19,171
but there's
a very long waiting list.

378
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:22,573
How long?
Well...

379
00:35:23,012 --> 00:35:25,845
this is an extremely
desirable location.

380
00:35:26,449 --> 00:35:28,109
Space is very limited.

381
00:35:28,383 --> 00:35:29,816
You mean restricted,
don't you?

382
00:35:29,884 --> 00:35:31,511
I do have
a board of directors...

383
00:35:31,586 --> 00:35:33,781
and I have
a membership committee.

384
00:35:35,457 --> 00:35:40,120
They have to approve.
Don't do this to me. Don't.

385
00:35:41,128 --> 00:35:43,926
How long have I been working
for you? Three years?

386
00:35:43,998 --> 00:35:46,796
Taking out your garbage,
cleaning up after you...

387
00:35:47,067 --> 00:35:49,467
and then you're going to say
I'm not good enough?

388
00:35:49,536 --> 00:35:52,231
Let me tell you something,
you're going to let me in...

389
00:35:52,305 --> 00:35:53,966
because I know
what goes on around here.

390
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,268
Do your
committee members know...

391
00:35:55,341 --> 00:35:57,275
what the fuck is going out
with the garbage?

392
00:35:58,344 --> 00:36:00,710
So, you're gonna let me in,
you hear me?

393
00:36:01,648 --> 00:36:04,411
Maybe we could talk about this when
you're a little less excited.

394
00:36:22,933 --> 00:36:25,492
I won't be needing
this man anymore.

395
00:36:49,223 --> 00:36:51,248
Take that, you scary zombie.

396
00:36:52,493 --> 00:36:53,926
... come back to God.

397
00:36:53,995 --> 00:36:55,724
Give up your lives of sin.

398
00:36:56,197 --> 00:36:59,359
Praise the Lord!
Father is the only way.

399
00:37:00,033 --> 00:37:02,001
Come back to Jesus.

400
00:37:03,837 --> 00:37:06,067
Fox, get the guys.
We're going out.

401
00:37:07,741 --> 00:37:11,437
Want me to call Riley? Forget
Riley. Just us. Come on.

402
00:37:14,246 --> 00:37:15,440
Thanks.

403
00:37:18,784 --> 00:37:21,479
Shit, man. You win. You
got him right in the brain.

404
00:37:21,553 --> 00:37:24,078
That's right.
Double or nothing.

405
00:37:27,892 --> 00:37:30,622
Brubaker, who'd you blow
to get this cushy job?

406
00:37:30,695 --> 00:37:32,992
Cholo, you
bum, how's it going?

407
00:37:33,163 --> 00:37:36,155
Where's Riley?
He's retired.

408
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,359
We're taking the truck out.

409
00:37:39,136 --> 00:37:42,128
That's from yesterday.
What? You're shitting me.

410
00:37:42,206 --> 00:37:44,139
I'm gonna quit drinking, man.

411
00:37:46,843 --> 00:37:49,971
What the hell is that? Relax.
It's just target practice.

412
00:37:50,046 --> 00:37:52,139
Barrett, stop scratching
around back there.

413
00:37:52,215 --> 00:37:53,512
You're going to
fuck up my shot.

414
00:37:53,616 --> 00:37:56,812
I'm not doing nothing, man,
I'm just standing here.

415
00:38:11,832 --> 00:38:13,493
There's nothing there, man.

416
00:38:16,137 --> 00:38:18,104
So, what the hell is that,
screaming practice?

417
00:38:18,171 --> 00:38:19,798
Stenches!
They're all over the place.

418
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:26,436
Let's make our move. Come on.

419
00:38:31,817 --> 00:38:33,444
All right, go.

420
00:38:39,458 --> 00:38:40,481
Their eyes.

421
00:38:44,595 --> 00:38:46,324
Mouse, take that.

422
00:38:46,531 --> 00:38:48,192
Cholo, should we send up
some sky flowers?

423
00:38:48,266 --> 00:38:49,290
It ain't our fight, Fox.

424
00:38:49,367 --> 00:38:51,494
The stenches want to get in,
let them in. Come on.

425
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:55,404
Everybody, get busy.

426
00:39:03,579 --> 00:39:05,945
That's our way out.
Should we do something about this?

427
00:39:06,015 --> 00:39:08,142
That's our way out,
get us there.

428
00:39:21,629 --> 00:39:22,618
No.

429
00:39:23,164 --> 00:39:24,153
Get out of here!

430
00:39:25,467 --> 00:39:27,195
No!

431
00:40:25,087 --> 00:40:26,554
Kaufman.

432
00:40:26,889 --> 00:40:28,186
The one that got away.

433
00:40:28,257 --> 00:40:29,724
That's right.

434
00:40:30,158 --> 00:40:33,093
Remember you said we should talk
when I was less excited?

435
00:40:33,161 --> 00:40:34,889
I'm a lot less excited
right now.

436
00:40:34,962 --> 00:40:36,589
What do you want, Mr. DeMora?

437
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:39,856
You might have noticed that
I had to leave in a hurry...

438
00:40:39,934 --> 00:40:42,869
so I didn't get a chance
to take my money out of your bank.

439
00:40:42,937 --> 00:40:45,063
I'd like you to handle
that withdrawal for me.

440
00:40:45,138 --> 00:40:48,073
With interest: $5 million.

441
00:40:48,575 --> 00:40:51,601
Or I'm gonna blow you
out of your fucking castle.

442
00:40:51,678 --> 00:40:53,270
Because I got Dead Reckoning.

443
00:40:53,914 --> 00:40:55,472
That's unfortunate.

444
00:40:55,549 --> 00:40:57,982
Well, unfortunate for you,
perhaps.

445
00:40:58,284 --> 00:41:00,218
I want you to put that money
on a boat...

446
00:41:00,286 --> 00:41:03,517
and send it across the river to the South Side,
10th Street Pier.

447
00:41:03,589 --> 00:41:05,557
One man to drive the boat,
no more.

448
00:41:05,891 --> 00:41:07,983
You have till midnight,
that's two and a half hours.

449
00:41:08,059 --> 00:41:10,289
I won't be there, and Dead
Reckoning won't be there.

450
00:41:10,361 --> 00:41:13,489
But I'll know if it happens, and
I'll know if it doesn't happen.

451
00:41:13,565 --> 00:41:14,657
Copy?

452
00:41:19,169 --> 00:41:20,363
Trouble?

453
00:41:20,571 --> 00:41:22,732
In a world where the dead
are returning to life...

454
00:41:22,873 --> 00:41:25,842
the world "trouble"
loses much of its meaning.

455
00:41:26,376 --> 00:41:29,004
He wants money.
Pay him.

456
00:41:29,179 --> 00:41:31,612
We don't negotiate
with terrorists.

457
00:41:33,583 --> 00:41:35,448
We have other options.

458
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:39,516
Denbo. Give me Denbo.

459
00:41:41,324 --> 00:41:43,553
Get up. You're coming with me.

460
00:41:45,627 --> 00:41:48,528
Where you taking him?
Don't worry.

461
00:41:49,631 --> 00:41:51,622
Where are you taking him?

462
00:41:56,537 --> 00:41:59,506
You take care of him?
Hell, yeah.

463
00:42:01,575 --> 00:42:04,668
He pulled me out of the fire.

464
00:42:05,645 --> 00:42:07,010
It was bad.

465
00:42:09,215 --> 00:42:11,945
Just look at me,
you can tell it was bad.

466
00:42:19,791 --> 00:42:23,784
Mr. Denbo,
can I offer you a drink?

467
00:42:23,862 --> 00:42:26,729
I don't drink.
Why am I here?

468
00:42:27,298 --> 00:42:30,392
We want you to repossess a
vehicle that belongs to us...

469
00:42:30,468 --> 00:42:32,868
a vehicle that you
designed, Mr. Denbo.

470
00:42:32,937 --> 00:42:35,963
Dead Reckoning has been stolen
by your second-in-command...

471
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,065
who I want captured
or killed...

472
00:42:38,142 --> 00:42:41,440
and I want my $2 million
piece of equipment returned.

473
00:42:41,511 --> 00:42:42,773
My truck.

474
00:42:43,413 --> 00:42:46,712
My truck, which has guns.

475
00:42:46,983 --> 00:42:48,473
Powerful guns.

476
00:42:48,685 --> 00:42:50,117
It'll do
a great deal of damage...

477
00:42:50,185 --> 00:42:52,312
if they're aimed
at this city.

478
00:42:52,388 --> 00:42:54,322
Why don't you just
send out your troops?

479
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:56,449
I can send 50 men
against that thing...

480
00:42:56,525 --> 00:43:00,154
and they'd come back in
body bags. Now, Cholo was your man.

481
00:43:00,262 --> 00:43:03,822
Maybe you can get close enough
to do what has to be done.

482
00:43:04,899 --> 00:43:07,390
It's a good thing
I'm still in town.

483
00:43:08,636 --> 00:43:10,399
See, I bought a car.

484
00:43:10,638 --> 00:43:13,162
I was going to drive out
of here, but it disappeared.

485
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:15,231
I guess someone
didn't want me to leave.

486
00:43:15,308 --> 00:43:17,333
You're a very popular man.

487
00:43:21,815 --> 00:43:24,578
How much are your services
going to cost me?

488
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:28,211
A vehicle, enough weapons
and ammunition to go north.

489
00:43:28,654 --> 00:43:31,646
But there's nothing up north.
That's the idea.

490
00:43:32,491 --> 00:43:34,958
There's one more thing:
My friends, they go with me.

491
00:43:35,026 --> 00:43:36,357
Take them.

492
00:43:38,663 --> 00:43:42,258
Can you find Dead Reckoning,
quickly?

493
00:43:42,333 --> 00:43:44,130
How quickly?
Midnight.

494
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:46,636
I have a way.

495
00:43:50,941 --> 00:43:53,000
Mouse, there are three things
a man must do alone:

496
00:43:53,077 --> 00:43:55,978
Be born, die, and we all know
the other one, don't we?

497
00:43:56,046 --> 00:43:58,570
Yeah, okay, Cholo. Just don't
leave me here alone too long...

498
00:43:58,648 --> 00:44:01,378
Two hours max. Give me a call. Let
me know if we're rich or not.

499
00:44:01,451 --> 00:44:02,577
All right, two hours.

500
00:44:02,652 --> 00:44:04,244
Give him something
for the nerves.

501
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:06,311
Something for the nerves.

502
00:44:08,091 --> 00:44:09,990
Stay real. Okay.

503
00:45:43,177 --> 00:45:47,011
Can't believe you guys are
turning me into a fucking boy scout.

504
00:45:48,549 --> 00:45:49,880
Not a boy.

505
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:52,413
You don't have to come out
if you don't want to.

506
00:45:52,485 --> 00:45:54,146
I didn't say that.

507
00:45:54,987 --> 00:45:59,253
Some shit, though, going out
to save Kaufman's ass.

508
00:45:59,492 --> 00:46:00,925
I'm not doing this
for Kaufman.

509
00:46:00,993 --> 00:46:02,289
This is for the people
in the city.

510
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:06,023
What do you think's going to
happen to them if Cholo shells the Green?

511
00:46:06,097 --> 00:46:08,088
Okay. I'm with you.

512
00:46:09,634 --> 00:46:11,829
No, I like the ones
I already got.

513
00:46:11,903 --> 00:46:14,393
This piece
fires 14 rounds a second.

514
00:46:15,306 --> 00:46:17,604
I don't normally need
that many.

515
00:46:18,843 --> 00:46:21,175
I don't normally
talk to retards.

516
00:46:24,914 --> 00:46:27,041
Pretty easy to make fun
of some people, huh?

517
00:46:27,116 --> 00:46:29,949
I could make
a whole lot of fun out of you.

518
00:46:31,221 --> 00:46:32,950
I'll take this one.

519
00:46:35,425 --> 00:46:36,948
He thinks
he's taking care of you.

520
00:46:37,025 --> 00:46:38,049
He does.

521
00:46:38,126 --> 00:46:39,821
Without his guns,
I'd be dead by now.

522
00:46:39,895 --> 00:46:42,227
Without you,
he'd be dead by now.

523
00:46:42,631 --> 00:46:43,689
Fair trade.

524
00:46:43,765 --> 00:46:47,030
Riley, these guys are coming.

525
00:46:48,336 --> 00:46:50,463
Gentlemen and lady.

526
00:46:51,072 --> 00:46:53,267
Mr. Kaufman thought
you could use some support.

527
00:46:53,341 --> 00:46:55,935
Don't need any.
Nevertheless. Manolete.

528
00:46:56,110 --> 00:46:59,169
Manolete,
named after the bullfighter.

529
00:46:59,946 --> 00:47:03,006
Monica.
You can call me Motown.

530
00:47:04,317 --> 00:47:05,648
Pillsbury.

531
00:47:09,222 --> 00:47:12,588
I'm here to do something.
Why are we standing around?

532
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:14,883
Let's do something.

533
00:47:18,898 --> 00:47:19,922
We taking the jeep?

534
00:47:19,999 --> 00:47:21,863
The Woody.
It's bigger, has guns.

535
00:47:26,804 --> 00:47:31,207
Jeez. Cholo made a mess. No.
Cholo didn't do all this.

536
00:47:31,843 --> 00:47:34,333
This is stenches.
A lot of them.

537
00:47:34,945 --> 00:47:36,572
Maybe still here.

538
00:47:39,483 --> 00:47:41,883
That's where they came in.
Look.

539
00:47:41,952 --> 00:47:43,510
That's where they went out.

540
00:47:43,587 --> 00:47:47,078
Trying to get to the city.
I'm going to go get the ammo.

541
00:47:47,156 --> 00:47:49,283
Crank up the Woody, Charlie.

542
00:47:50,026 --> 00:47:51,493
Make sure
she doesn't hurt herself.

543
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:53,152
I can take care of myself,
okay?

544
00:47:53,229 --> 00:47:56,459
Fine. Charlie, make sure
she doesn't hurt anyone else.

545
00:47:56,531 --> 00:47:58,192
You, come with me.

546
00:48:02,370 --> 00:48:04,031
Walkers, Mr. Denbo?

547
00:48:04,105 --> 00:48:05,834
And moving toward the city.

548
00:48:05,907 --> 00:48:08,704
They'll never get across the river.
I wouldn't be so sure.

549
00:48:09,176 --> 00:48:10,905
They learned
how to work together.

550
00:48:10,978 --> 00:48:12,878
They're mindless
walking corpses...

551
00:48:12,947 --> 00:48:14,141
and many of us
will be, too...

552
00:48:14,214 --> 00:48:16,842
if you don't stay focused
on the task at hand.

553
00:48:18,052 --> 00:48:21,179
Zombies, man.
They creep me out.

554
00:48:21,621 --> 00:48:23,748
Do you really think they
can get across the water?

555
00:48:23,823 --> 00:48:26,087
If you asked me that a week
ago, I would have said no.

556
00:48:26,159 --> 00:48:27,524
But now...

557
00:48:28,561 --> 00:48:31,427
One way or the other, we got to
get our hands on Dead Reckoning.

558
00:48:31,496 --> 00:48:33,726
There's more of them
out there.

559
00:48:33,966 --> 00:48:36,764
I can hear them.
They're always out there.

560
00:48:37,536 --> 00:48:40,767
You're all right?
Yeah, no problem.

561
00:48:51,048 --> 00:48:52,674
Woody's in there.

562
00:49:08,297 --> 00:49:12,358
Who's got the keys, guys?
No keys to get. Melted.

563
00:49:12,768 --> 00:49:16,203
Screw the keys. Let's just
hot-wire the fucking thing.

564
00:49:24,846 --> 00:49:26,040
Yellow to red.

565
00:49:26,114 --> 00:49:29,276
What the fuck does a Samoan know
about hot-wiring a fucking car?

566
00:49:29,349 --> 00:49:32,409
Fifty thousand cars stolen
in Samoa every year.

567
00:49:32,519 --> 00:49:34,919
Yeah? Well,
a million in Detroit.

568
00:49:34,988 --> 00:49:37,218
Detroit's got 50 million cars.

569
00:49:37,290 --> 00:49:41,089
Samoa: 50,000.
Every one stolen.

570
00:49:46,499 --> 00:49:48,023
Charlie.

571
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:52,099
Why do you lick your rifle?
It catches the light.

572
00:49:54,606 --> 00:49:57,598
What light?
How can you see anything?

573
00:49:57,809 --> 00:49:59,071
Good eye.

574
00:50:01,945 --> 00:50:03,003
Hey.

575
00:50:04,014 --> 00:50:05,242
Charlie?

576
00:50:06,650 --> 00:50:07,776
Shit!

577
00:50:12,922 --> 00:50:14,947
Off-center, but I got him.

578
00:50:16,759 --> 00:50:17,987
Awesome, man.

579
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:27,425
Got a flashlight?
Yeah.

580
00:50:39,346 --> 00:50:40,938
Brubaker?

581
00:50:47,754 --> 00:50:49,244
Hey, Brubaker?

582
00:50:51,758 --> 00:50:53,521
Brubaker, you there?

583
00:50:54,894 --> 00:50:56,418
Hear that?
Yeah.

584
00:51:14,512 --> 00:51:17,072
All right, keep that thing
shining. Let's get ammo.

585
00:51:17,148 --> 00:51:19,809
There's. 50 caliber
around here somewhere.

586
00:51:19,883 --> 00:51:21,680
Great. Here's the. 50.

587
00:51:34,096 --> 00:51:35,563
Jesus Christ.

588
00:51:46,374 --> 00:51:49,343
No, not in here.
Think about where we are.

589
00:51:50,111 --> 00:51:51,601
Take a breath.

590
00:51:53,381 --> 00:51:55,041
Choose your shots.

591
00:52:26,077 --> 00:52:28,237
We're even.
Not.

592
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:31,607
That hurt. I didn't hurt you.

593
00:52:35,886 --> 00:52:37,251
I got it.

594
00:52:48,631 --> 00:52:49,859
Oh, God.

595
00:53:00,676 --> 00:53:02,336
Is he bit?
Yeah.

596
00:53:04,412 --> 00:53:05,436
Go!

597
00:53:33,372 --> 00:53:35,237
How long does he have?

598
00:53:36,808 --> 00:53:40,972
Had a little brother bit. He took
less than an hour before he turned.

599
00:53:41,946 --> 00:53:43,846
And then what happened?

600
00:53:45,149 --> 00:53:46,514
I shot him.

601
00:53:48,785 --> 00:53:50,980
You said nothing bad
ever happened to you.

602
00:53:51,054 --> 00:53:53,181
That happened to my brother.

603
00:53:54,491 --> 00:53:57,392
Yeah. Dead is dead.

604
00:54:01,664 --> 00:54:04,155
And that ain't you or me.

605
00:54:10,972 --> 00:54:13,463
I'm sorry.
No! No!

606
00:54:31,458 --> 00:54:33,982
I recognize that
some of you are concerned...

607
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:36,051
and I wanna assure you...

608
00:54:36,496 --> 00:54:39,932
that if anything goes wrong,
measures have been taken.

609
00:54:40,199 --> 00:54:43,463
I've established outposts
with food and supplies...

610
00:54:43,535 --> 00:54:45,833
that will support us
on our way.

611
00:54:46,038 --> 00:54:49,201
On our way to where?
Anywhere that we want to go.

612
00:54:49,308 --> 00:54:51,868
Alternative sites have been
chosen for us and our families...

613
00:54:51,943 --> 00:54:54,968
as well as
necessary support personnel.

614
00:54:55,046 --> 00:54:56,536
What about all the others?

615
00:54:56,614 --> 00:54:58,479
All the others
can be replaced by others.

616
00:54:58,549 --> 00:55:00,744
Boss.
You're interrupting me, Bill.

617
00:55:01,118 --> 00:55:02,346
It's bad timing.

618
00:55:02,453 --> 00:55:06,013
Just when I was talking about
how people can be replaced.

619
00:55:06,156 --> 00:55:09,717
A day may come when you earn
yourself some responsibilities.

620
00:55:09,793 --> 00:55:12,023
But right now
the responsibilities are mine.

621
00:55:12,095 --> 00:55:13,722
They're all mine.

622
00:55:13,963 --> 00:55:16,488
It was my ingenuity
that took an old world...

623
00:55:16,566 --> 00:55:18,430
and made it
into something new.

624
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:20,991
I put up the fences
to make it safe.

625
00:55:21,136 --> 00:55:24,299
I hired the soldiers
and paid for their training.

626
00:55:24,373 --> 00:55:29,036
I kept the people off the streets
by giving them games and vices...

627
00:55:29,477 --> 00:55:31,240
which cost me money.

628
00:55:31,312 --> 00:55:33,678
But I spend it because
the responsibility is mine.

629
00:55:33,748 --> 00:55:37,548
Now, do you understand the
meaning of the word responsibility?

630
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:41,449
We have to do
what we have to do.

631
00:55:44,558 --> 00:55:47,152
Foxy, I know
I'm never gonna be great.

632
00:55:47,227 --> 00:55:49,354
I'm never gonna be on the list
of names of people...

633
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:52,056
who done great things
because I don't do anything.

634
00:55:52,131 --> 00:55:53,621
Not one thing.

635
00:55:55,067 --> 00:55:57,433
If it wasn't for this truck,
I wouldn't be any different...

636
00:55:57,503 --> 00:55:59,300
than that poor Mexican bastard
out there.

637
00:55:59,372 --> 00:56:01,806
Cholo, look,
Kaufman might not pay.

638
00:56:02,174 --> 00:56:03,902
Kaufman's gonna pay, man.

639
00:56:03,975 --> 00:56:07,433
But if he doesn't, he knows
I'm gonna do a jihad on his ass.

640
00:56:29,098 --> 00:56:31,293
When you hit
Route 6, take a right.

641
00:56:31,367 --> 00:56:33,665
How do you know
which way to go?

642
00:56:34,170 --> 00:56:36,331
Homing device.
Cool.

643
00:56:46,548 --> 00:56:48,742
How long
since you been out here?

644
00:56:48,816 --> 00:56:50,579
I've never been out.

645
00:56:51,986 --> 00:56:56,082
I've lived in the city
since it was a real city.

646
00:56:58,793 --> 00:57:00,123
Pull over.

647
00:57:04,063 --> 00:57:05,826
Cover them, Charlie.

648
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:09,826
All right, you're working for
Kaufman, I'm working for Kaufman.

649
00:57:09,903 --> 00:57:11,335
My job is to stop Cholo.

650
00:57:11,403 --> 00:57:15,897
Your job is to bring the truck
back, with or without me, right?

651
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:18,772
Not without you, no.
Well, that means yes.

652
00:57:18,844 --> 00:57:20,106
Here's what's going to happen.

653
00:57:20,179 --> 00:57:23,204
I'm going to do my job.
You're not going to get to do yours.

654
00:57:23,281 --> 00:57:25,943
Kaufman is never going to see
Dead Reckoning again.

655
00:57:26,017 --> 00:57:29,077
And when I get it, I'm
gonna do what I want with it.

656
00:57:29,153 --> 00:57:32,953
Anyone has any problems with
that, you can get out right here.

657
00:57:34,257 --> 00:57:37,351
Some choice.
No choice. Close door.

658
00:57:39,196 --> 00:57:41,460
Keep them covered,
Charlie.  Wait.

659
00:57:41,531 --> 00:57:43,260
You made us come
all the way out here...

660
00:57:43,333 --> 00:57:45,163
just to steal a fucking truck?

661
00:57:45,234 --> 00:57:46,792
You made a deal, Riley.

662
00:57:46,869 --> 00:57:49,133
You're going back on a deal.
You never done that before.

663
00:57:49,205 --> 00:57:51,435
If Cholo shells the Green,
all deals are off.

664
00:57:52,708 --> 00:57:54,903
If something worse happens,
I don't know about you...

665
00:57:54,977 --> 00:57:57,774
but I don't want to be
out here in a car without a roof.

666
00:58:07,955 --> 00:58:09,923
Mouse, you got anything?

667
00:58:10,190 --> 00:58:12,420
No boat, no money, no nothing.

668
00:58:20,466 --> 00:58:22,195
Load the six-packs.

669
01:00:19,275 --> 01:00:20,799
Six-pack loaded.

670
01:00:20,876 --> 01:00:23,106
All right, load the other six.

671
01:00:23,345 --> 01:00:26,246
We're not gonna show them
any goddamn mercy.

672
01:00:32,921 --> 01:00:35,115
I know where
Cholo's going. Where?

673
01:00:35,189 --> 01:00:37,589
Mount Washington,
overlooks the city.

674
01:00:37,658 --> 01:00:38,852
We can beat him there.

675
01:00:38,926 --> 01:00:40,894
In that truck, he's
gotta take the main roads.

676
01:00:40,961 --> 01:00:43,122
We can take the back streets. Right.

677
01:00:43,197 --> 01:00:45,563
Make a right on Ivy, then
take a left on Westminster.

678
01:00:45,633 --> 01:00:47,964
You wanna go up the hill?
Yes, I'm wanna go up the hill.

679
01:00:48,034 --> 01:00:49,831
Let's go up the hill.

680
01:02:03,570 --> 01:02:04,798
Almost midnight, sir.

681
01:02:04,871 --> 01:02:06,497
Pack us up.
We might be leaving.

682
01:02:06,572 --> 01:02:07,596
In the boat?

683
01:02:07,673 --> 01:02:09,300
I'd rather be taking
Dead Reckoning...

684
01:02:09,375 --> 01:02:11,036
but not available.

685
01:02:27,958 --> 01:02:30,085
From this hillside,
they can shell the Green.

686
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:32,219
They're gonna be coming up
this road.

687
01:02:32,296 --> 01:02:34,321
Pull in around the corner.

688
01:03:19,139 --> 01:03:20,333
All right, they're coming.

689
01:03:20,406 --> 01:03:22,374
You guys stay here
and keep real quiet.

690
01:03:22,442 --> 01:03:24,500
I'm going to try
and talk my way inside.

691
01:03:25,677 --> 01:03:27,736
He's going to steal that truck
and leave us here.

692
01:03:27,813 --> 01:03:29,303
Riley would never do that.

693
01:03:29,381 --> 01:03:31,474
Just look at him, you can
tell he'd never do that.

694
01:03:31,550 --> 01:03:34,144
I like that man.
You, go help him.

695
01:03:35,154 --> 01:03:36,142
Go.

696
01:03:51,802 --> 01:03:53,997
Everything's okay back there.

697
01:03:54,704 --> 01:03:56,899
It's too late
to send me back.

698
01:03:57,207 --> 01:03:58,468
Now, put that thing away.

699
01:03:58,541 --> 01:04:01,738
Put on your best Sunday smile,
and just try to look friendly.

700
01:04:01,811 --> 01:04:03,301
I am friendly.

701
01:04:05,514 --> 01:04:07,744
Hey, Cholo.
Take a look at this.

702
01:04:07,817 --> 01:04:09,807
It's Denbo and his idiot.

703
01:04:10,485 --> 01:04:12,510
All right. Stop the truck.

704
01:04:14,856 --> 01:04:16,346
Come on, here.

705
01:04:21,361 --> 01:04:23,829
So, how did you get up here?
In the Woody.

706
01:04:23,897 --> 01:04:25,194
I tracked you with this.

707
01:04:25,265 --> 01:04:26,289
Forgot to tell you...

708
01:04:26,366 --> 01:04:28,459
the truck's got a
little transmitter in her belly.

709
01:04:28,535 --> 01:04:30,196
You were always a smart guy.

710
01:04:30,270 --> 01:04:32,067
Always a lot smarter
than me, man.

711
01:04:32,139 --> 01:04:33,400
That's not saying much.

712
01:04:33,940 --> 01:04:36,340
Open up.
What, are you fucking nuts?

713
01:04:36,409 --> 01:04:37,637
Open up.

714
01:04:50,522 --> 01:04:51,989
Hey, Charlie.

715
01:04:55,426 --> 01:04:57,451
So, who's the smart one now?

716
01:04:57,528 --> 01:04:58,756
Thought you would have quit...

717
01:04:58,829 --> 01:05:01,457
but here you are still working for
the man, aren't you, Riley?

718
01:05:01,532 --> 01:05:03,466
What? Kaufman sent you up
to take care of me?

719
01:05:03,534 --> 01:05:04,626
Yeah.

720
01:05:05,302 --> 01:05:07,929
Takes a true friend to stab you
right in the front, doesn't it?

721
01:05:08,271 --> 01:05:10,501
That man pulls the trigger,
he's dead.

722
01:05:14,611 --> 01:05:16,476
Who else is out there?

723
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:20,378
Kaufman sent some guys with
us. We took care of them.

724
01:05:26,088 --> 01:05:27,419
Cover him.

725
01:05:28,156 --> 01:05:30,385
Pretty Boy,
lock in the target.

726
01:05:45,338 --> 01:05:46,771
We're running out of time.

727
01:05:47,173 --> 01:05:48,663
I got you now.

728
01:06:55,502 --> 01:06:56,969
You hit
that tower square on...

729
01:06:57,037 --> 01:06:58,868
you're gonna kill
a lot of innocent people.

730
01:06:58,939 --> 01:07:02,203
You miss, you hit the city, you're
gonna kill a lot of our friends.

731
01:07:02,275 --> 01:07:03,799
Want to know
who killed our friends?

732
01:07:03,876 --> 01:07:05,969
Kaufman is the one
that's killed our friends.

733
01:07:06,045 --> 01:07:08,912
Every time I took out his garbage,
I took out one of our friends...

734
01:07:08,982 --> 01:07:10,609
people he wanted
off the streets.

735
01:07:10,683 --> 01:07:13,014
He turned me into a goon, then
he's gonna piss all over me?

736
01:07:13,085 --> 01:07:14,109
I don't think so.

737
01:07:22,460 --> 01:07:24,291
What are you gonna get
out of this, Cholo?

738
01:07:24,395 --> 01:07:25,657
Hopefully my money.

739
01:07:26,130 --> 01:07:28,928
Money burns.
Yeah, not if it's in a vault.

740
01:07:34,237 --> 01:07:37,331
All right, Mr. K.,
won't be needing you anymore.

741
01:07:45,914 --> 01:07:47,814
You set this right?
Yes.

742
01:07:48,350 --> 01:07:50,875
Riley, you did something to it
with your fucking little toy.

743
01:07:50,953 --> 01:07:53,547
This? What the fuck did you do? Fix it.

744
01:07:55,691 --> 01:07:57,521
Fix it.
Not a fucking chance.

745
01:08:06,567 --> 01:08:08,431
Cholo, look out.

746
01:08:30,655 --> 01:08:31,747
Fuck.

747
01:08:38,496 --> 01:08:40,054
You know, Riley...

748
01:08:40,131 --> 01:08:42,564
there's something about you
that I've always really hated.

749
01:08:42,633 --> 01:08:44,692
You're still here, aren't you?
What do you care?

750
01:08:44,768 --> 01:08:47,259
You got what you wanted.
You're hit.

751
01:08:47,538 --> 01:08:48,835
How you doing in there,
Charlie?

752
01:08:48,906 --> 01:08:50,635
I'm being friendly.

753
01:08:55,411 --> 01:08:57,402
What's in the bags?
Money.

754
01:08:57,814 --> 01:08:59,213
Whose money?

755
01:09:01,317 --> 01:09:03,308
Watch out. Get down. Quick.

756
01:09:04,886 --> 01:09:05,978
Ours.

757
01:09:10,325 --> 01:09:11,952
Yes?
We got Cholo.

758
01:09:14,396 --> 01:09:16,124
Kaufman.
I'm here.

759
01:09:17,631 --> 01:09:19,531
I just did something...

760
01:09:20,634 --> 01:09:22,932
I might not have done
otherwise.

761
01:09:31,511 --> 01:09:33,001
You lied to me, Denbo.

762
01:09:33,079 --> 01:09:35,570
You didn't get DeMora.
He's shooting at us.

763
01:09:36,950 --> 01:09:38,439
That's not Cholo, Mr. Kaufman.

764
01:09:40,686 --> 01:09:43,052
Holy shit.
They got across the river.

765
01:09:43,122 --> 01:09:44,248
Look at that.

766
01:09:44,323 --> 01:09:45,915
I didn't even have to
blow the place up.

767
01:09:45,991 --> 01:09:47,458
The fucking stenches
did it for me.

768
01:09:54,132 --> 01:09:57,568
We're going back to the city
to see if we can help. Pick him up.

769
01:09:57,635 --> 01:09:59,262
Where we going, man?
What are we doing?

770
01:09:59,337 --> 01:10:02,430
Easy, Gargantua, come on.
Get him inside. Quick.

771
01:10:02,572 --> 01:10:04,802
Not this horse.
Not this horse.

772
01:10:05,675 --> 01:10:07,575
Take that Woody
if you still got it.

773
01:10:07,644 --> 01:10:09,441
Fine.
You got me, too.

774
01:10:10,313 --> 01:10:11,507
Thanks.

775
01:10:12,182 --> 01:10:13,580
Anyone else?

776
01:10:16,752 --> 01:10:17,912
Where you gonna go, Cholo?

777
01:10:17,987 --> 01:10:19,887
There's always that outpost
in Cleveland.

778
01:10:19,955 --> 01:10:22,116
Haven't heard from them
in a while.

779
01:10:22,191 --> 01:10:23,623
Take my chances.

780
01:10:26,494 --> 01:10:28,155
You have no right.

781
01:10:29,731 --> 01:10:30,823
No right.

782
01:10:32,267 --> 01:10:34,633
Woody's around the corner.
Guns and ammo inside.

783
01:10:34,702 --> 01:10:35,895
Thanks.

784
01:10:36,470 --> 01:10:38,404
Get us back on the main road.

785
01:10:43,477 --> 01:10:46,240
You have blood, here.
We almost lost you there.

786
01:10:46,612 --> 01:10:48,375
You all right?
Yeah.

787
01:10:48,447 --> 01:10:50,745
You want to be really helpful,
roll me one.

788
01:10:50,816 --> 01:10:52,340
Yeah, all right.

789
01:11:32,487 --> 01:11:35,251
What was built to keep people
safe is gonna trap them inside.

790
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:39,752
This is Denbo
in the Reckoning.

791
01:11:39,828 --> 01:11:41,762
Open up those fences
and let the people out.

792
01:11:41,830 --> 01:11:44,093
The fences are still hot. We
can't cut the juice from here.

793
01:11:44,165 --> 01:11:45,826
We've been trying to call
the power station.

794
01:11:45,900 --> 01:11:47,128
There's no one
left over there.

795
01:11:47,201 --> 01:11:48,668
We got to get the fuck
out of here.

796
01:11:48,769 --> 01:11:50,100
There's no one left here,
either.

797
01:11:50,171 --> 01:11:51,399
Move it.

798
01:11:55,542 --> 01:11:56,907
We can rocket those fences.

799
01:11:56,977 --> 01:11:58,342
Got to get across river.

800
01:11:58,411 --> 01:12:00,743
The bridges into the
city, they're all bricked up.

801
01:12:00,814 --> 01:12:02,543
Let's just fucking
blast our way through.

802
01:12:02,616 --> 01:12:03,674
No, we can't do that.

803
01:12:03,750 --> 01:12:06,582
There's a war going on over
there. We cross any of these bridges...

804
01:12:06,652 --> 01:12:08,483
we're gonna end up
right in the middle of it.

805
01:12:08,554 --> 01:12:10,488
We have to come in
outside of the Throat.

806
01:12:13,125 --> 01:12:15,059
Somehow, Fox, I thought
we'd be traveling...

807
01:12:15,127 --> 01:12:17,185
in a lot better style
than this, baby.

808
01:12:17,262 --> 01:12:19,321
At least we're still
fucking traveling, brother.

809
01:12:20,498 --> 01:12:21,590
What?

810
01:12:35,812 --> 01:12:37,712
Come on, Fox, let's
get the hell out of here.

811
01:12:56,264 --> 01:12:57,356
What?

812
01:13:00,802 --> 01:13:02,666
Can you fucking believe it?

813
01:13:02,736 --> 01:13:05,102
Nothing works out
the way you want it to.

814
01:13:05,172 --> 01:13:08,664
There's something always comes
around the corner and just gets you.

815
01:13:13,513 --> 01:13:15,378
It's your choice, bro.

816
01:13:18,551 --> 01:13:21,645
I always wanted to see
how the other half lives.

817
01:13:25,957 --> 01:13:27,720
The old J&L can take us over.

818
01:13:27,793 --> 01:13:29,283
It's a drawbridge.
They leave it up.

819
01:13:29,361 --> 01:13:31,352
That means it's not guarded.
Can you get us there?

820
01:13:31,430 --> 01:13:32,454
Yeah.
Let's go.

821
01:15:57,596 --> 01:15:59,427
I can stay with you,
if you want.

822
01:15:59,498 --> 01:16:00,692
No. No.

823
01:16:00,999 --> 01:16:03,229
This is between me
and the man.

824
01:16:07,171 --> 01:16:08,934
Fox, she's all yours.

825
01:16:09,006 --> 01:16:11,941
Hope you do better
than you did with me, man.

826
01:16:12,510 --> 01:16:13,602
Yeah.

827
01:16:50,644 --> 01:16:52,271
Holy shit!

828
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:55,007
A disturbance
has been reported...

829
01:16:55,082 --> 01:16:56,344
on the outskirts of the city.

830
01:16:56,416 --> 01:16:57,906
There's no reason
to believe...

831
01:16:57,985 --> 01:17:00,248
that Fiddler's Green
could ever be compromised.

832
01:17:00,319 --> 01:17:04,585
But we suggest that residents report any sightings
of unusual behavior.

833
01:18:09,849 --> 01:18:13,285
There it is. Let's hope
it's still wired into the grid.

834
01:18:17,591 --> 01:18:19,252
Shut the hatch, just in case.

835
01:18:19,325 --> 01:18:22,419
When I get the bridge down,
you come pick me up.

836
01:18:28,367 --> 01:18:30,698
How do you work this thing?
It's just like a video game.

837
01:18:39,277 --> 01:18:41,404
What the fuck are you doing?

838
01:18:41,512 --> 01:18:43,308
Making myself useful.

839
01:18:53,522 --> 01:18:55,422
Wait. Wait. Stop. Stop!

840
01:19:23,550 --> 01:19:24,812
Stenches.

841
01:19:26,420 --> 01:19:27,750
Starboard.

842
01:19:31,991 --> 01:19:33,891
They're behind us, too.

843
01:19:41,066 --> 01:19:42,795
I can't get a shot.

844
01:20:07,957 --> 01:20:09,288
Now shoot!

845
01:20:38,318 --> 01:20:40,411
They'll never get in here.
Neither will Riley.

846
01:20:40,487 --> 01:20:42,284
Unlock the
roof hatch, Pretty Boy.

847
01:20:46,692 --> 01:20:47,954
Oh, shit.

848
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:50,785
Riley, go for the roof.
Okay.

849
01:21:04,042 --> 01:21:05,134
Roll!

850
01:21:08,613 --> 01:21:10,546
What are you doing? Forward!

851
01:21:10,614 --> 01:21:11,876
I'm gonna
shake these bastards.

852
01:22:01,461 --> 01:22:02,393
Get out of the way.

853
01:22:03,997 --> 01:22:05,157
Hello?

854
01:22:05,465 --> 01:22:06,624
Hello?

855
01:22:10,569 --> 01:22:12,036
What is it?
Is something going on?

856
01:22:12,104 --> 01:22:13,594
Stenches!

857
01:22:24,782 --> 01:22:26,010
We're fucked.

858
01:22:27,518 --> 01:22:29,041
Angle the mortars
for the Throat...

859
01:22:29,119 --> 01:22:30,950
and send up some sky flowers.

860
01:22:31,021 --> 01:22:32,750
Got her!

861
01:22:50,172 --> 01:22:51,661
Oh, thank God.

862
01:23:29,708 --> 01:23:31,175
Watch it now.

863
01:23:32,110 --> 01:23:33,475
Oh, my God.

864
01:23:35,013 --> 01:23:36,775
Downstairs. The car.

865
01:23:42,586 --> 01:23:44,884
You bastards!
You have no right!

866
01:23:50,660 --> 01:23:52,890
Mr. Kaufman, come on,
let's go.

867
01:24:00,569 --> 01:24:02,764
Mr. Kaufman
wants you to know...

868
01:24:02,838 --> 01:24:04,430
All right,
we're going to the boat.

869
01:24:04,506 --> 01:24:06,531
... he has dedicated himself
to your well-being.

870
01:24:06,608 --> 01:24:08,166
Be careful
when you open that door.

871
01:24:08,243 --> 01:24:11,336
Should I call the crew, sir?
No, I'll call them.

872
01:24:33,198 --> 01:24:34,927
God damn it.

873
01:24:36,368 --> 01:24:37,858
What the fuck?

874
01:24:51,716 --> 01:24:53,274
Goodbye, Mr. K.

875
01:24:53,351 --> 01:24:56,410
Come back here, you son of a
bitch. You got the fucking keys.

876
01:26:51,258 --> 01:26:53,226
Fucking spic bastard.

877
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:25,347
Nah. You're dead.

878
01:27:27,091 --> 01:27:29,559
Oh, my God. You are dead.

879
01:28:03,090 --> 01:28:05,388
Number 1's clear.
Going for Number 2.

880
01:28:05,459 --> 01:28:07,086
I don't normally need
that many.

881
01:28:07,161 --> 01:28:09,219
Don't bother. Come on down.

882
01:28:12,765 --> 01:28:13,993
Blow the fences.

883
01:28:46,296 --> 01:28:48,526
Sky flowers
don't work no more.

884
01:28:50,534 --> 01:28:51,694
Shoot.

885
01:28:52,869 --> 01:28:54,597
But there's people.

886
01:28:54,970 --> 01:28:57,768
Those people are all dead.
Shoot, Charlie.

887
01:29:24,298 --> 01:29:25,822
We're too late.

888
01:29:26,867 --> 01:29:27,890
No.

889
01:29:29,235 --> 01:29:30,327
Look.

890
01:29:48,386 --> 01:29:49,910
You saved them.

891
01:30:06,836 --> 01:30:08,736
You staying or leaving?

892
01:30:09,105 --> 01:30:10,697
You?
Leaving.

893
01:30:10,974 --> 01:30:13,203
Unless you need my help.
No.

894
01:30:13,642 --> 01:30:14,870
Why don't you stick around?

895
01:30:14,943 --> 01:30:17,673
We could turn this place into
what we always wanted it to be.

896
01:30:17,746 --> 01:30:18,906
Maybe.

897
01:30:19,948 --> 01:30:23,111
Then what will we turn into?
We'll see, won't we?

898
01:30:28,956 --> 01:30:31,447
You want to go
to Canada now, Riley?

899
01:30:31,692 --> 01:30:33,922
Sure, if no one
has any objections.

900
01:30:33,995 --> 01:30:36,087
No, we'll take you with us.

901
01:30:36,896 --> 01:30:38,625
I'll try to make myself
useful.

902
01:30:39,199 --> 01:30:42,191
Anchor, load the guns.
We're hitting the road.

903
01:30:56,081 --> 01:30:57,571
Now we can go.

904
01:31:34,115 --> 01:31:35,173
No.

905
01:31:35,483 --> 01:31:38,111
They're just looking
for a place to go.

906
01:31:40,388 --> 01:31:41,753
Same as us.

907
01:31:45,259 --> 01:31:47,625
Fire off what's left inside
those tubes.

908
01:31:47,695 --> 01:31:49,993
We're not gonna need it
anymore.

909
01:32:00,573 --> 01:32:02,063
Take us north.
