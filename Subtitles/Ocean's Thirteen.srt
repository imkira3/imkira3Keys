1
00:00:38,187 --> 00:00:42,358
Valencia, CA 2:43 am

2
00:01:30,698 --> 00:01:32,159
Yeah.

3
00:01:33,117 --> 00:01:34,785
Shit.

4
00:01:35,953 --> 00:01:37,580
Where is he?

5
00:01:39,749 --> 00:01:41,375
Gotta go.

6
00:02:15,326 --> 00:02:16,535
What's the latest?

7
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:21,499
- Nothing. They say the first 24 hours...
- Right.

8
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:26,253
- Did she understand?
- It's not their fight.

9
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,381
Did she understand?

10
00:02:29,674 --> 00:02:30,841
It's not their fight.

11
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:50,987
- Hey.
- Hey, Linus.

12
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,035
- Hey, where are Tess and Isabel?
- It's not their fight.

13
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:00,705
Any change?

14
00:03:00,871 --> 00:03:04,375
He's in critical condition, but he's still
alive. You know, if he doesn't...

15
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:06,877
- Is Stan there?
- Yeah, he's been there an hour.

16
00:03:07,086 --> 00:03:09,588
Stan'll tell us what's going on.

17
00:03:11,382 --> 00:03:14,093
Myocardial infarction.

18
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:17,263
He's endured an incredible shock
to his system.

19
00:03:17,763 --> 00:03:20,891
Can he recover? Yes.

20
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:23,227
Will he recover?

21
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:27,356
It helps if they have something
to live for.

22
00:03:27,523 --> 00:03:28,983
Family?

23
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:36,991
Friends, then.

24
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,952
Maybe that'll be enough.

25
00:03:43,414 --> 00:03:46,959
<i>Reuben, when it comes to Willy Bank,</i>
<i>you can't rely on contracts.</i>

26
00:03:47,251 --> 00:03:48,961
My lawyers say they're ironclad.

27
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:50,171
Four weeks earlier...

28
00:03:50,338 --> 00:03:53,674
- Give me credit for my business <i>sechel</i>.
- I don't think it's a good idea.

29
00:03:53,841 --> 00:03:56,260
- Neither does Rusty.
- Well, I'm doing it. It's done.

30
00:03:56,427 --> 00:04:01,140
And you tell Rusty that I won't have to
pull jobs to keep my hotel solvent.

31
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:02,892
Hey, Reuben.

32
00:04:03,059 --> 00:04:07,188
You fellas are young.
You don't understand.

33
00:04:08,105 --> 00:04:12,276
Do you know that the Inuit people
put their elders out on a ice floe...

34
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:14,862
...to die when they're too old to hunt?
Thanks.

35
00:04:15,029 --> 00:04:16,280
That's just a myth.

36
00:04:16,447 --> 00:04:19,283
Well, that ain't gonna happen to me.
I can still hunt.

37
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:23,204
This is it. It's my chance.
I used to mean something in this town.

38
00:04:23,371 --> 00:04:25,873
I would walk into a restaurant.
If it was full...

39
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,250
...they'd snap out a new table
for me like that!

40
00:04:28,417 --> 00:04:30,628
If you're worried
about your place in history...

41
00:04:30,795 --> 00:04:33,506
...let us get a street
named after you, or a boulevard.

42
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:36,133
We can talk about that when I'm dead.
Danny...

43
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,638
...I appreciate you coming this far
to see me, but I gotta do this.

44
00:04:42,848 --> 00:04:45,017
<i>- Reuben!</i>
<i>- Partner!</i>

45
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:48,187
Reuben!
Oh, so good of you to come.

46
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:51,816
Of course. Of course.
Are there more items for my punch list?

47
00:04:51,983 --> 00:04:54,819
I got so much energy,
I can hardly sleep from the excitement!

48
00:04:54,986 --> 00:04:57,029
Where are you at on the visas
for the chefs?

49
00:04:57,196 --> 00:05:00,825
My man in Washington says
they'll be stamped by the time we open.

50
00:05:01,033 --> 00:05:04,537
- No, no, no. Not good enough.
- That's what I said.

51
00:05:07,873 --> 00:05:11,043
Oh, that's good. And the chandeliers?

52
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:14,839
My ex-wife's new brother-in-law...
You don't need the details. It's done!

53
00:05:15,006 --> 00:05:17,174
Half price. They're already
at the warehouse.

54
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:20,761
And because I know it mattered to you...

55
00:05:20,928 --> 00:05:23,556
...I appeared before the city council.

56
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:27,393
The one-way street leading away
from the rear entrance...

57
00:05:27,685 --> 00:05:30,771
...now leads toward the rear entrance.

58
00:05:30,938 --> 00:05:34,567
- All roads lead to the Midas!
- This is perfect!

59
00:05:34,859 --> 00:05:39,530
Great views up here.
Where's the partners' desk gonna be?

60
00:05:40,197 --> 00:05:41,741
Oh, no partners' desk.

61
00:05:43,075 --> 00:05:46,120
- Two desks?
- No two desks. One desk.

62
00:05:46,287 --> 00:05:49,206
One chairman's desk. One.

63
00:05:51,334 --> 00:05:54,420
The arrangement is changing.

64
00:05:55,629 --> 00:05:59,717
Was changed. As a matter of fact,
there is no arrangement.

65
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,387
Everybody said that
you would try to screw me.

66
00:06:03,554 --> 00:06:06,265
That you done it
to every one of your partners.

67
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:09,268
But I defended you. I said, "No!

68
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:11,896
Me and Willy Bank been around
long enough...

69
00:06:12,063 --> 00:06:14,106
...that we both shook Sinatra's hand.

70
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:17,109
And there's a code among guys
that shook Sinatra's hand."

71
00:06:17,318 --> 00:06:18,569
Screw Sinatra's hand.

72
00:06:18,736 --> 00:06:22,114
- Screw...?
- You're dead weight.

73
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:25,910
You think I'm gonna carry you
and pay you at the same time?

74
00:06:26,077 --> 00:06:28,621
Reuben, you're out!

75
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:32,750
- Never. This is my land.
- Was. Was your land.

76
00:06:32,917 --> 00:06:35,961
- You signed it over to the corporation.
- For 50-percent interest!

77
00:06:36,253 --> 00:06:39,340
Which I'm gonna ask you
to sign over to me...

78
00:06:39,507 --> 00:06:41,801
...for a small cash payment.

79
00:06:43,594 --> 00:06:45,596
I'm not signing that.

80
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:48,265
Get out of here. I'm not signing that.

81
00:06:51,769 --> 00:06:55,439
- Are you gonna throw me off the roof?
- Well, I don't want to.

82
00:06:56,565 --> 00:06:59,777
This is wrong. This is all wrong.

83
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:06,867
You're leaving me with nothing.

84
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:11,789
You know, you're right. And it's rude.

85
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:16,252
Here.

86
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:18,462
It's the first batch.

87
00:07:18,963 --> 00:07:20,631
Just got made.

88
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:28,848
You changed the name.

89
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:31,392
I like it better!

90
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:33,644
Don't you?

91
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:44,238
<i>Reuben.</i>

92
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:46,699
<i>He always was too trusting.</i>

93
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:51,037
<i>- Is, Saul. Is.</i>
<i>- Of course. Is.</i>

94
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:55,041
<i>You try talking him out of it next time.</i>

95
00:07:55,207 --> 00:07:57,168
<i>Look, Bank hurt Reuben.</i>

96
00:07:57,335 --> 00:08:00,421
<i>I know how that makes me feel.</i>
<i>I know what that makes me wanna do.</i>

97
00:08:00,588 --> 00:08:03,924
<i>I'm gonna get close to Bank,</i>
<i>and I don't care if it gets messy.</i>

98
00:08:04,091 --> 00:08:06,344
I'll drive you.
We'll get him leaving his barber.

99
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:09,513
- Then I'll inject him.
- I'll find a spot to get rid of the body.

100
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:11,349
All valid ideas.

101
00:08:11,515 --> 00:08:13,601
Great initiative. But...

102
00:08:13,768 --> 00:08:16,437
But even though Bank
stepped over the line...

103
00:08:16,604 --> 00:08:18,939
...we have to do what's best
for Reuben.

104
00:08:19,106 --> 00:08:21,692
Which means, we offer Bank
a Billy Martin.

105
00:08:21,859 --> 00:08:24,445
What? He goes for it, and that's it?
He just gets off?

106
00:08:24,612 --> 00:08:26,280
- That's the rule.
- That's the rule...

107
00:08:26,447 --> 00:08:29,158
...for someone who understands
the rules, which Bank don't.

108
00:08:29,325 --> 00:08:31,577
He already broke them.
So he don't get the chance.

109
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:33,954
For Reuben...

110
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:37,458
...I think we give him a chance.

111
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:43,381
I need answers before I ask questions.
You get that?

112
00:08:43,547 --> 00:08:45,257
All right, do it.

113
00:08:46,884 --> 00:08:51,722
So some guys I take seriously...

114
00:08:51,889 --> 00:08:55,893
...told me you're a serious guy.
- Good.

115
00:08:56,268 --> 00:08:58,938
What I want,
what's most important to me...

116
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:02,566
...is that Reuben gets his share
of the hotel restored.

117
00:09:02,733 --> 00:09:06,570
- I'm here to give you a chance to do that.
- Oh, you're gonna give me a chance?

118
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:09,865
Okay.

119
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:15,579
It's a Billy Martin? I pass.

120
00:09:15,746 --> 00:09:18,165
Last time I looked...
And I look every morning.

121
00:09:18,332 --> 00:09:20,001
- It was my name listed as owner...

122
00:09:20,167 --> 00:09:23,963
...on more valuable property in this state
than anyone else in history.

123
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:27,925
- Which means you got a lot more to lose.
- Well, I don't lose.

124
00:09:28,426 --> 00:09:32,263
People who bet on me to lose lose,
and they lose big.

125
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:35,641
You come at me,
you better know I move quick...

126
00:09:35,933 --> 00:09:39,228
...and when I do,
I slice like a goddamn hammer.

127
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:41,939
So you're not gonna
make Reuben whole?

128
00:09:42,106 --> 00:09:45,484
If Reuben was too weak or too stupid
to see what was coming down...

129
00:09:45,776 --> 00:09:48,612
...then you know what?
He doesn't belong here.

130
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:54,285
He's made the right choice:
Roll over and die. Let him be.

131
00:09:59,957 --> 00:10:02,126
How long do I have to wait
for a conduit?

132
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:05,880
I don't want the labor pains.
I just want the baby.

133
00:10:06,255 --> 00:10:10,801
Six months later...

134
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:41,874
Well, thanks for coming.

135
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,085
Thanks for the hundred grand.

136
00:10:44,251 --> 00:10:48,464
If this takes longer than a day, though,
we're gonna have to renegotiate.

137
00:10:48,631 --> 00:10:50,341
That's fair.

138
00:10:50,508 --> 00:10:53,844
I'd like some Sencha or Genmaicha.

139
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:55,721
Green tea. Yes, sir.

140
00:10:56,013 --> 00:11:00,017
And don't burn it. Pour it just
before boiling point, not after.

141
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:02,937
Green tea. <i>Sì,</i> signore.

142
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:07,233
Just us three?

143
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:10,403
- For now, we figured...
- Figured we'd talk to you first.

144
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:14,657
- Good Lord. How stuck are you?
- Stuck.

145
00:11:14,824 --> 00:11:17,201
- Stalled, really.
- Stuck.

146
00:11:18,536 --> 00:11:20,079
Run it for me.

147
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:24,208
Don't leave anything out.
Give me the big picture.

148
00:11:24,542 --> 00:11:26,377
- You wanna...?
- It's all yours.

149
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:28,462
- Where should we start?
- With the hotel.

150
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:41,600
<i>Bank's swinging for the fences</i>
<i>on this one.</i>

151
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:45,438
<i>Forget weekenders and conventioneers.</i>
<i>He's built this place for whales.</i>

152

<i>The chefs stolen from the highest-rated</i>

<i>the silverware is actually gold.</i>

155
00:12:00,077 --> 00:12:03,122
<i>Bank's greatest strength</i>
<i>is also his weakness: Ego.</i>

156
00:12:03,414 --> 00:12:07,126
<i>He's been spending his days checking and</i>
<i>rechecking every inch of the property...</i>

157
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:09,420
<i>... getting ready for the grand opening.</i>

158
00:12:09,587 --> 00:12:11,088
<i>It's a compulsion.</i>

159
00:12:12,548 --> 00:12:15,468
<i>Bank's right-hand man is a woman:</i>
<i>Abigail Sponder.</i>

160
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,596
We're gonna have to let you go.
Turn in your uniform.

161
00:12:18,763 --> 00:12:20,806
I only gained 4 pounds. You can't.

162
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:23,434
Your body mass index is not
what it's supposed to be.

163
00:12:23,601 --> 00:12:25,519
- But Ms. Sponder...
- Oh, no, baby doll.

164
00:12:25,686 --> 00:12:27,980
It's your butt that's the problem.

165
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:32,276
<i>You can't fire no waitress</i>
<i>based on appearance.</i>

166
00:12:32,443 --> 00:12:35,112
<i>- That's just unconstitutional.</i>
<i>- If they were waitresses.</i>

167
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,448
They're actually hired
as "models who serve"...

168
00:12:37,615 --> 00:12:39,992
...so Bank can monitor
their physical appearance.

169
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,494
It's a cruel, cruel practice.

170
00:12:41,661 --> 00:12:43,788
Between Bank and Sponder,
the place is covered.

171
00:12:43,954 --> 00:12:46,332
- When's opening night?
- July third.

172
00:12:46,624 --> 00:12:50,336
Got fireworks at the stroke of midnight.
The whole shebang.

173
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,755
We're going in now? It's already open.

174
00:12:52,922 --> 00:12:55,841
It's a soft opening, to test the place
before the grand opening.

175
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:58,803
It's kind of like an out-of-town preview,
only it's in town.

176
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:02,098
Soft opening, grand opening.
When they opened the Flamingo...

177
00:13:02,264 --> 00:13:06,018
...one day it was closed, the next day
it was open. End of story.

178
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,854
- I know, I was there.
- Well, it's different now.

179
00:13:09,146 --> 00:13:11,857
- So when is opening night?
- July third.

180
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:16,362
Now, the top casinos can clear
$3 million a day just on the floor.

181
00:13:16,696 --> 00:13:20,408
Bank, with his high-level players
and no limits, is projecting 5.

182
00:13:20,574 --> 00:13:24,245
But in exchange for the loans, he had to
give up 6 of the 9 seats on the board.

183
00:13:24,412 --> 00:13:27,873
He doesn't control his company,
and a couple of the guys aren't friendlies.

184
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,710
So he has to clear 500 million
in the first quarter...

185
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:33,045
...or he gets dumped
out of his own hotel.

186
00:13:33,838 --> 00:13:37,842
And, of course, Bank wants another
Five Diamond Award. Fifth in a row.

187
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:43,055
Every hotel I have ever owned has won
a Royal Review Five Diamond Award.

188
00:13:43,347 --> 00:13:45,266
The Sagarro Inn, five diamonds.

189
00:13:45,433 --> 00:13:47,727
The Peloponnesian, Monte Carlo,
five diamonds.

190
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:52,523
The Grand Sapphire, Singapore,
<i>cinco diamantes!</i>

191
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:55,318
The Otemanu Crest, Tahiti...

192
00:13:56,902 --> 00:13:58,195
I've never not won one.

193
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:01,574
<i>- So how are you gonna get the diamonds?</i>
<i>- We're not.</i>

194
00:14:01,741 --> 00:14:03,826
We thought about it,
then we decided it was...

195
00:14:03,993 --> 00:14:05,411
Impossible.

196
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:08,456
But he's not gonna be winning any more.
Tell him about Debbie.

197
00:14:08,622 --> 00:14:09,874
Yeah, tell me about Debbie.

198
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:14,420
Debbie is concierge at The Bank.
She's very ambitious...

199
00:14:14,754 --> 00:14:16,922
<i>... in a good way, for us.</i>

200
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:20,217
<i>As soon as I said the words</i>
<i>"general manager" and "Macao"...</i>

201
00:14:20,384 --> 00:14:24,597
<i>... she was in.</i>
<i>I put a cherry on top to make sure.</i>

202
00:14:25,806 --> 00:14:27,725
<i>We found out who'd</i>
<i>be reviewing the hotel.</i>

203
00:14:27,892 --> 00:14:29,935
<i>We're gonna get to him</i>
<i>before Bank can.</i>

204
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:32,271
<i>I feel bad. It's like torture.</i>

205
00:14:33,397 --> 00:14:37,443
This is war, kid.
There's gonna be collateral damage.

206
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:40,571
And he gets the Susan B. Anthony
at the airport.

207
00:14:40,738 --> 00:14:42,615
- He doesn't know that.
- So what?

208
00:14:42,782 --> 00:14:44,950
He has to know why he won to enjoy it?

209
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:48,412
- Who says?
- So you'd go through that for 10 million?

210
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:51,624
No. I'd do it for 11 mil.

211
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:03,260
Now, we've found out Bank is tapped
into the federal fingerprint database.

212
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:05,096
Highly illegal.

213
00:15:06,097 --> 00:15:09,600
We came up with a way to piggyback
his system between firewall checks.

214
00:15:09,767 --> 00:15:12,770
- Very interesting stuff out there.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. What else?

215
00:15:12,979 --> 00:15:14,814
We're gonna get his whales.

216
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:18,317
- How?
- He talked to Denny Shields.

217
00:15:18,609 --> 00:15:22,530
Denny Shields? After he bragged
about you guys to Toulour...

218
00:15:22,697 --> 00:15:25,449
...and started that whole slog?
- We need him.

219
00:15:25,616 --> 00:15:27,076
I should've kept my mouth shut.

220
00:15:27,243 --> 00:15:30,246
And then I saw that guy walking around.
I didn't know who he was.

221
00:15:30,413 --> 00:15:33,165
He was just some guy to me.
And I guess I pissed him off.

222
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:36,711
Denny, there's no way you could've
known who he was, so just forget it.

223
00:15:36,877 --> 00:15:38,129
It's okay. Let it go.

224
00:15:38,295 --> 00:15:42,842
Well, the other stuff I got taken care of
is all straight. I got 18 whales.

225
00:15:43,134 --> 00:15:47,513
I spoke to their handlers, I spoke to their
managers, I spoke to their assistants.

226
00:15:47,805 --> 00:15:50,975
Every one of them's gonna leave.
We're gonna do it in two tiers.

227
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:54,145
- I'm leaving first. They're gonna follow.
- Great.

228
00:15:54,312 --> 00:15:57,690
Okay. But you gotta make sure they win,
because these guys usually lose.

229
00:15:58,024 --> 00:16:01,569
- And when they lose, they get comped.
- They're gonna win big.

230
00:16:01,736 --> 00:16:03,195
- How big?
- Five hundred.

231
00:16:03,487 --> 00:16:05,740
- Million? Just the group of you?
- No.

232
00:16:05,906 --> 00:16:08,784
- No, it's a reverse big store.
- Right.

233
00:16:08,951 --> 00:16:11,746
- Doesn't matter if we win.
- As long as the casino loses, yes.

234
00:16:11,912 --> 00:16:14,832
That could actually work.
So you need to rig...

235
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:17,293
Craps, blackjack, roulette, slots.

236
00:16:18,836 --> 00:16:21,839
Now this polymer reacts
to ultrasonic pulses.

237
00:16:22,006 --> 00:16:25,217
But it's not metallic, so the compasses
on the table won't detect it.

238
00:16:25,509 --> 00:16:29,513
And it don't affect the weight
when they mike the dice. Now, this...

239
00:16:30,014 --> 00:16:32,016
Not really a lighter?

240
00:16:34,101 --> 00:16:37,188
<i>Dice are controlled from the manufacturer</i>
<i>all the way to the floor.</i>

241
00:16:37,355 --> 00:16:40,358
<i>Which is why we went all the way</i>
<i>to the manufacturer.</i>

242
00:16:59,126 --> 00:17:01,879
You think they could kick on
the air conditioning?

243
00:17:16,018 --> 00:17:17,395
It's dangerous.

244
00:17:17,561 --> 00:17:18,938
Put your mask back on.

245
00:17:21,565 --> 00:17:24,235
Danger is my middle name.

246
00:17:27,363 --> 00:17:31,033
So that's not your problem.
So you're jammed on blackjack?

247
00:17:31,242 --> 00:17:33,536
We've embedded Livingston
in the Shuffle company.

248
00:17:33,703 --> 00:17:37,164
The tack will stimulate your EKG
much in the same way a lie would.

249
00:17:37,331 --> 00:17:40,001
But you have to step on it during
the control questions...

250
00:17:40,167 --> 00:17:41,502
...name, birthdate, so on...

251
00:17:41,669 --> 00:17:44,922
...so those levels will match
the stress levels of your false answers.

252
00:17:45,089 --> 00:17:47,133
Got it. How much is this gonna hurt?

253
00:17:47,383 --> 00:17:49,760
If you're doing it right,
should be excruciating.

254
00:17:49,927 --> 00:17:55,057
- Is your birthdate February 11 th, 1965?
- Yes.

255
00:17:55,391 --> 00:17:58,728
- Are you wearing a white shirt?
- Yes.

256
00:17:58,978 --> 00:18:01,981
Have you ever been involved
in the commission of a crime?

257
00:18:03,065 --> 00:18:04,317
No.

258
00:18:04,567 --> 00:18:08,487
Have you ever defrauded or attempted
to defraud the gaming industry?

259
00:18:09,613 --> 00:18:10,865
No.

260
00:18:11,032 --> 00:18:13,451
- Alex?
- Solid.

261
00:18:13,784 --> 00:18:15,244
I love technology.

262
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:17,997
To look at you, I'd swear
you were being evasive...

263
00:18:18,164 --> 00:18:20,624
...but the machine says you're clean.

264
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:24,420
I'm just a little nervous.
I really want this job.

265
00:18:25,421 --> 00:18:28,758
Well, you can relax now.
Welcome to Shuffle Royale.

266
00:18:29,091 --> 00:18:30,968
The Shuffle Royale.

267
00:18:31,135 --> 00:18:33,346
Well, I doubt I've heard
the last of that one.

268
00:18:34,096 --> 00:18:39,101
So if blackjack is not your problem,
it must be slots.

269
00:18:39,352 --> 00:18:42,396
Progressives run off
computer chips now.

270
00:18:42,605 --> 00:18:45,524
You're gonna have to
program in a trap door.

271
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:48,569
I can probably find you
someone to do that.

272
00:18:48,736 --> 00:18:49,987
Thanks, Roman.

273
00:18:50,154 --> 00:18:53,157
We got somebody on the inside.
A great kid named Eugene.

274
00:18:53,324 --> 00:18:55,076
He's got a little too much downtime.

275
00:18:55,326 --> 00:18:57,078
<i>He's run up a nice online gaming tab.</i>

276
00:18:57,244 --> 00:18:59,955
<i>He won't be able to keep it</i>
<i>a secret much longer.</i>

277
00:19:00,122 --> 00:19:04,043
Now I have no... Yeah, it's crazy.

278
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:09,548
- How bad is it?
- It's bad. I owe $30,000.

279
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:12,593
- So it may as well be a hundred.
- All right.

280
00:19:13,427 --> 00:19:15,346
Let's call it a hundred.

281
00:19:17,598 --> 00:19:19,266
Thanks, Danny.

282
00:19:19,433 --> 00:19:23,104
Eugene, my pleasure. Now tell me how
you're gonna program that trap door.

283
00:19:23,354 --> 00:19:26,440
<i>So if that's not the problem,</i>
<i>it must be roulette.</i>

284
00:19:26,607 --> 00:19:29,360
<i>Cutting edge in that game</i>
<i>is infrared scanner in the shoe...</i>

285
00:19:29,527 --> 00:19:32,113
<i>... wired to a microcomputer</i>
<i>somewhere on your person...</i>

286
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:35,950
<i>... which figures the probability of where</i>
<i>the wheels will land to three digits.</i>

287
00:19:36,117 --> 00:19:38,661
<i>Yeah, we tried that.</i>

288
00:19:42,873 --> 00:19:45,042
<i>The way he was dressed didn't help.</i>

289
00:19:45,209 --> 00:19:47,545
<i>Not very subtle, this guy.</i>

290
00:19:49,797 --> 00:19:51,340
<i>- So you're stuck on roulette.</i>
<i>- No.</i>

291
00:19:51,507 --> 00:19:54,552
We're going lo-fi. We figured we'd
get some loaded balls in there.

292
00:19:54,719 --> 00:19:56,637
You're kidding.
How are you gonna deliver?

293
00:19:56,804 --> 00:20:00,224
Two stages.
First, we position a man of our own.

294
00:20:00,474 --> 00:20:02,893
There's a gaming expo
the day of the grand opening...

295
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:06,647
...which Bank is committed to attend,
to show what a regular guy he is.

296
00:20:06,814 --> 00:20:08,441
<i>Frank's suiting up as the gamer.</i>

297
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:11,485
<i>The men who make the decisions</i>
<i>are very, very hard to impress.</i>

298
00:20:11,652 --> 00:20:14,864
That's why I'm asking each
and every one of you to help me sell it...

299
00:20:15,031 --> 00:20:20,661
...by being the most classy,
genteel ladies.

300
00:20:20,995 --> 00:20:25,750
The image that we're looking for
is a tasteful elegance.

301
00:20:27,752 --> 00:20:31,547
- What exactly do you want us to do?
- Raise those skirts up about three inches.

302
00:20:32,173 --> 00:20:36,844
<i>Second part: We tie Frank to one</i>
<i>of theirs, a pit boss with sticky fingers.</i>

303
00:20:37,928 --> 00:20:39,263
How much for these?

304
00:20:45,269 --> 00:20:49,023
Does Willy Bank know you're stealing
his gold flatware, Neil?

305
00:20:50,191 --> 00:20:51,442
How do you know my name?

306
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,945
Oh, we know a lot of names.

307
00:20:55,363 --> 00:21:00,451
Know your wife, Mary,
your kids, Leanne and Dolly.

308
00:21:00,868 --> 00:21:03,204
We know you're the pit boss
at the casino.

309
00:21:03,454 --> 00:21:05,289
Come on, you don't wanna... Please!

310
00:21:05,539 --> 00:21:07,500
We don't wanna hurt you.
We wanna help you.

311
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:10,211
We want to double your salary
all in one night.

312
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,714
What do you need me to do?

313
00:21:13,964 --> 00:21:15,966
Right now, nothing.
Go home, do your job...

314
00:21:16,133 --> 00:21:19,470
...and at the appropriate moment,
somebody will present themself to you.

315
00:21:19,637 --> 00:21:21,472
- Enough said?
- Enough said.

316
00:21:21,639 --> 00:21:25,059
Who is the shill at the expo
to rope Bank?

317
00:21:25,309 --> 00:21:27,311
- We're still looking.
- We'll find someone.

318
00:21:27,561 --> 00:21:29,772
Make sure it's someone
he really despises.

319
00:21:30,731 --> 00:21:35,236
Back to macro.
What is your exit strategy?

320
00:21:37,071 --> 00:21:41,325
The players won't be in on the scam,
so they'll all think it's their lucky night.

321
00:21:41,492 --> 00:21:44,370
But you'll never get them out the door
with all their winnings.

322
00:21:44,537 --> 00:21:48,332
They'll dump it all back.
That's Vegas, and that's your problem.

323
00:21:48,582 --> 00:21:51,919
Well, the exit strategy is a problem,
it's not the problem.

324
00:21:52,253 --> 00:21:55,006
The problem is security.
We're drawing a blank.

325
00:21:55,172 --> 00:21:56,882
And it's a little spooky.

326
00:21:57,049 --> 00:22:00,511
The specs aren't on the gray market,
the black market or any other market.

327
00:22:00,678 --> 00:22:03,055
All I hear is there's never been
a system like this.

328
00:22:03,222 --> 00:22:06,350
I found out where they designed it,
but I can't get in the building.

329
00:22:06,517 --> 00:22:08,686
I've blown all my buy money,
my bribe money...

330
00:22:08,853 --> 00:22:11,147
...four of my best IDs,
and I am nowhere.

331
00:22:11,314 --> 00:22:14,025
Not only am I nowhere,
I'm pretty sure I'm being followed.

332
00:22:14,275 --> 00:22:16,444
<i>- Do you have anything?</i>
- I think I have a name.

333
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:19,030
I don't even know if it's right.
They're calling it...

334
00:22:19,196 --> 00:22:22,700
The Greco. The Greco Player Tracker.

335
00:22:23,784 --> 00:22:25,619
They're putting it in Vegas.

336
00:22:27,788 --> 00:22:31,000
- I'll give you back the hundred grand.
- Why?

337
00:22:32,293 --> 00:22:35,254
Danny, I like you.

338
00:22:35,421 --> 00:22:38,299
And you, Rusty. I mean, you got style.

339
00:22:38,632 --> 00:22:41,677
You got brio. You got loyalty.

340
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:45,181
You two are the Morecambe and Wise
of the thievery world...

341
00:22:45,348 --> 00:22:46,974
...but even they went off the boil.

342
00:22:47,224 --> 00:22:49,727
You're analog players in a digital world.

343
00:22:51,062 --> 00:22:52,647
You're done.

344
00:22:54,148 --> 00:22:59,695
Believe me, I would love to go
up against Greco, and crush him...

345
00:23:00,738 --> 00:23:02,323
...but it can't be beat.

346
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:05,993
It can't be hacked, and it can't be beat.

347
00:23:06,327 --> 00:23:09,830
- Not even by you?
- With 18 months...

348
00:23:09,997 --> 00:23:13,334
...nothing else on my plate,
no other jobs, women or distractions...

349
00:23:14,085 --> 00:23:15,336
...maybe.

350
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:17,421
You know everything about this thing.

351
00:23:17,672 --> 00:23:21,550
Everything except
where it was being deployed.

352
00:23:21,717 --> 00:23:24,178
The inventor
is an old schoolmate of mine.

353
00:23:24,512 --> 00:23:27,264
His name is Greco Montgomery.

354
00:23:27,431 --> 00:23:29,850
Pompous ass named it after himself.

355
00:23:30,851 --> 00:23:33,854
Greco? Roman?

356
00:23:34,021 --> 00:23:36,941
You've obviously never served time
in a British boarding school.

357
00:23:37,191 --> 00:23:39,193
So, what's so tough about this thing?

358
00:23:39,527 --> 00:23:43,698
It's an artificial-intelligence
security system.

359
00:23:44,115 --> 00:23:47,952
- They must be field testing.
- You mean it has a brain?

360
00:23:48,536 --> 00:23:50,663
A hell of a brain.

361
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:54,709
It doesn't only think, it reasons.

362
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:58,629
It reads every permutation in every wager
in every seat in the entire casino...

363
00:23:58,796 --> 00:24:00,047
...hand by hand.

364
00:24:00,381 --> 00:24:05,011
It's wired into floor security cameras that
measure pupil dilation and determine...

365
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:08,139
...if a win is legitimate or expected.

366
00:24:08,305 --> 00:24:11,726
It gathers biofeedback,
players' heart rates, body temperatures.

367
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,354
It measures
on a second-by-second basis...

368
00:24:15,521 --> 00:24:19,150
...whether the standard variations
of gaming algorithm are holding...

369
00:24:19,317 --> 00:24:23,362
<i>... or are being manipulated.</i>
<i>The data is analyzed in real time...</i>

370
00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:25,740
...in a field of exabytes.

371
00:24:26,615 --> 00:24:27,658
Exabytes?

372
00:24:27,825 --> 00:24:30,161
- You know what a terabyte is?
- Yeah, it's a...

373
00:24:30,411 --> 00:24:33,247
- An exabyte is a million terabytes.
- Right.

374
00:24:33,497 --> 00:24:36,584
The Greco is housed
in an impregnable room.

375
00:24:36,834 --> 00:24:39,337
Shock-mounted,
temperature-controlled...

376
00:24:39,587 --> 00:24:43,424
...and it locks down
if it even senses it is under attack.

377
00:24:43,758 --> 00:24:47,094
If it locks down, they wouldn't even
be able to get out of the room.

378
00:24:47,345 --> 00:24:50,848
Couldn't we just shut it off?
You know, cut the wires?

379
00:24:51,265 --> 00:24:52,642
That could work.

380
00:24:52,808 --> 00:24:55,519
- Better, kick the plug out at the socket.
- Seriously.

381
00:24:55,686 --> 00:24:59,231
Short of walking into that room with
a bloody magnetron around your neck...

382
00:24:59,398 --> 00:25:01,567
You know what a magnetron is?

383
00:25:02,193 --> 00:25:04,779
Something that screws up the Greco?

384
00:25:05,946 --> 00:25:08,074
Short of that...

385
00:25:09,283 --> 00:25:13,204
I'm kind of shocked this is where
we are, because this is a problem.

386
00:25:13,371 --> 00:25:14,580
That's what I said.

387
00:25:14,747 --> 00:25:17,166
- If we could somehow shut it off...
- There's no "if."

388
00:25:17,333 --> 00:25:18,876
It cannot be shut off.

389
00:25:19,126 --> 00:25:21,921
You'd need a real natural disaster,
an actual act of God.

390
00:25:22,088 --> 00:25:23,964
- But if we could beat it...
- You can't.

391
00:25:24,131 --> 00:25:25,383
- But if we did...
- You can't.

392
00:25:25,633 --> 00:25:28,886
- You could.
- Don't flatter.

393
00:25:29,303 --> 00:25:32,473
If we could, how long
would it take to reboot?

394
00:25:32,807 --> 00:25:36,227
Because it's so sophisticated,
three and a half minutes.

395
00:25:36,811 --> 00:25:40,064
- Might be enough.
- Pick your natural disaster.

396
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:45,111
Get me a laptop.

397
00:25:45,569 --> 00:25:49,573
The drill accesses through a sewer main
off Paris Drive.

398
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:53,995
It grinds along into the northwest
corner of the hotel, here.

399
00:25:54,328 --> 00:25:57,415
Probably about six rpm,
so you won't wake all the neighbors.

400
00:25:58,332 --> 00:26:03,337
When it reaches the resonant frequency,
the building acts like a tuning fork.

401
00:26:04,088 --> 00:26:07,091
To people inside,
it will feel like an earthquake.

402
00:26:08,175 --> 00:26:14,515
<i>That should knock out the Greco.</i>
<i>And that's your exit strategy.</i>

403
00:26:44,045 --> 00:26:46,297
- Hey, Bash!
- I'm up here!

404
00:26:49,508 --> 00:26:50,968
Hey.

405
00:26:51,218 --> 00:26:53,971
- Here you go. Okay.
- Great.

406
00:26:54,388 --> 00:26:57,141
Hey, where are the mags?

407
00:26:57,808 --> 00:26:59,977
- Linus...
- Look, I can't buy those things.

408
00:27:00,227 --> 00:27:02,980
I need them! I can't leave.
Why are you such a...?

409
00:27:03,147 --> 00:27:06,317
I'm sorry! Ask somebody else.
Ask Livingston.

410
00:27:06,567 --> 00:27:08,319
You're such a wowser.

411
00:27:09,403 --> 00:27:10,821
Look.

412
00:27:11,739 --> 00:27:13,491
Read this to Reuben.

413
00:27:17,912 --> 00:27:21,248
I've done research.
Positive messages get through.

414
00:27:21,666 --> 00:27:23,000
I can't say this.

415
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:25,503
No, I'm saying it. You're just the vessel.

416
00:27:25,753 --> 00:27:27,755
Come on, Basher.
Why don't you take a break?

417
00:27:27,922 --> 00:27:31,425
I'll watch all the equipment,
and you go read it to him.

418
00:27:32,093 --> 00:27:35,012
Shit! You know,
when they were digging the tunnel...

419
00:27:35,179 --> 00:27:37,431
...they had teams of guys
monitoring this.

420
00:27:37,598 --> 00:27:39,767
Yeah? How many?

421
00:27:41,268 --> 00:27:42,687
Teams!

422
00:27:47,274 --> 00:27:48,943
That's a 5.6.

423
00:27:49,276 --> 00:27:52,196
If you don't think a 5.6 is possible,
or even likely...

424
00:27:52,363 --> 00:27:55,950
...then quite frankly, you don't know
much about the Billups-Mancini Report...

425
00:27:56,117 --> 00:27:58,995
...specifically the section
on the Mojave Block.

426
00:27:59,453 --> 00:28:03,290
I know what you're hoping: That it'll just
be a blind thrust fault. It'll just...

427
00:28:03,457 --> 00:28:05,376
See that? That's Rusty. See Rusty?

428
00:28:05,543 --> 00:28:09,672
He's doing an Irwin Allen. See that?

429
00:28:10,131 --> 00:28:12,216
He's not deaf, Linus.

430
00:28:12,591 --> 00:28:16,554
<i>- Bottom-line me here.</i>
<i>- Close your hotel, permanently.</i>

431
00:28:16,721 --> 00:28:21,142
- What? We haven't even opened yet.
- What are all those people downstairs?

432
00:28:21,309 --> 00:28:23,602
- A soft open.
- It's like an out-of-town preview.

433
00:28:23,769 --> 00:28:26,689
You think you can just come in here,
tell me to close my hotel?

434
00:28:26,856 --> 00:28:28,274
I'm not gonna close my hotel.

435
00:28:28,441 --> 00:28:32,445
If you'll let me come in with my team for
a few days, I can prove what I'm saying.

436
00:28:32,611 --> 00:28:35,990
There is no way we are exposing
our exclusive clientele to a bunch of...

437
00:28:36,157 --> 00:28:39,243
Scientists? We wouldn't want that,
would we?

438
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:43,456
Let's just hope for the best, shall we?
That should be enough.

439
00:28:46,167 --> 00:28:49,670
Take this.
It's a standard torsion seismograph.

440
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:54,759
If there is a foreshock, it will register,
and you just might have time to evacuate.

441
00:28:54,925 --> 00:28:57,345
I don't want this thing on my desk.

442
00:28:57,511 --> 00:29:01,265
Let me tell you what you don't want: Your
hotel on the cover of <i>TIME</i> magazine...

443
00:29:01,432 --> 00:29:05,353
...in a twisted heap of steel and glass,
you and your customers are underneath it.

444
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:08,564
Headline reads, "Who's To Blame?"

445
00:29:08,898 --> 00:29:12,193
- That's what you don't want.
- Okay.

446
00:29:14,028 --> 00:29:16,530
Put an evacuation plan on paper.

447
00:29:16,864 --> 00:29:18,783
Will do, sir. Consider it done.

448
00:29:18,949 --> 00:29:21,202
I do thank you for your time.

449
00:29:22,036 --> 00:29:25,539
If you wanna put yourself to good use,
why don't you hit the tables?

450
00:29:25,706 --> 00:29:29,126
Oh, I don't gamble, sir. Neither should
you, not with people's lives.

451
00:29:29,377 --> 00:29:34,632
I'll screen the meetings more carefully
next time. Sorry, Mr. Bank.

452
00:29:38,469 --> 00:29:40,721
<i>And now we have a camera</i>
<i>in Bank's office.</i>

453
00:29:47,561 --> 00:29:49,605
I'll see you, Reuben.

454
00:30:00,574 --> 00:30:02,618
A letter from Basher.

455
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,415
"Dear Reuben.

456
00:30:08,249 --> 00:30:11,711
As the band said,
'Two hearts beat as one.'

457
00:30:11,877 --> 00:30:14,547
When men have been in battle together,
they are bonded...

458
00:30:14,714 --> 00:30:19,343
...like the flower and the soil and the sun.
And like the moon catches the light..."

459
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:22,179
Reuben, I'm gonna go ahead on
and leave this...

460
00:30:23,055 --> 00:30:24,807
...here.

461
00:30:28,269 --> 00:30:29,937
I'll see you, pal.

462
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:41,615
So she says, "What'd I do?"

463
00:30:41,782 --> 00:30:44,869
And I said, "What do I look like,
a pancake eater?"

464
00:30:45,286 --> 00:30:48,080
- So you just left it there on the floor?
- Right on the floor.

465
00:30:48,247 --> 00:30:50,458
- For how long?
- Next morning.

466
00:30:50,791 --> 00:30:52,251
Good.

467
00:30:56,714 --> 00:30:58,090
Yeah.

468
00:30:58,299 --> 00:31:01,427
Thanks, Debbie. Pack your swimsuit.

469
00:31:01,844 --> 00:31:03,387
All right.

470
00:32:39,066 --> 00:32:42,028
I don't wanna see any slack faces
in the front of the house.

471
00:32:42,194 --> 00:32:46,073
- Only happy faces. No slack faces.
- Right.

472
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,993
- Go! Go, go!
- Right.

473
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:57,543
I'm sorry.

474
00:33:06,093 --> 00:33:08,054
- Mr. Shields!
- Thanks.

475
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:11,349
Where are you going? We got you
booked through grand opening.

476
00:33:11,515 --> 00:33:14,393
A friend of mine, a very serious man...

477
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:18,105
...told me very seriously that it would
be a good idea if I left the hotel.

478
00:33:18,439 --> 00:33:20,107
I'm taking his suggestion, Willy.

479
00:33:20,441 --> 00:33:24,195
He can't be too serious if he knew
what I got in store for you.

480
00:33:24,445 --> 00:33:25,780
Willy, I'm out of here.

481
00:33:25,946 --> 00:33:27,448
- Oh, come on.
- See you, Willy.

482
00:33:27,698 --> 00:33:30,993
- I really hate to see you go, man.
- Let's go.

483
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:36,707
Bank here.

484
00:33:37,625 --> 00:33:39,377
Confirmed?

485
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:46,300
- Where?
- The gentleman in the trilby, sir.

486
00:33:46,801 --> 00:33:48,427
The what?

487
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:51,389
The Dr. Dolittle hat.

488
00:33:51,555 --> 00:33:53,808
Well, why didn't you just say that?

489
00:33:54,934 --> 00:33:56,519
Okay.

490
00:33:57,144 --> 00:33:58,688
Okay.

491
00:33:59,647 --> 00:34:01,315
Yes, sir.

492
00:34:09,323 --> 00:34:14,245
- Excuse me, Mr...?
- Chubb, Kensington Chubb.

493
00:34:14,412 --> 00:34:18,332
Mr. Chubb, would you like to follow me?
I might be able to move things along.

494
00:34:18,499 --> 00:34:21,669
How very nice of you. No, no, no.

495
00:34:22,003 --> 00:34:24,505
Her Highness is a very delicate animal.

496
00:34:24,839 --> 00:34:28,718
It upsets her so if anyone
but Papa carries her about.

497
00:34:28,884 --> 00:34:33,014
- All's well, dear.
- Why don't you just follow me?

498
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:37,518
You're very considerate. I do
appreciate what you're doing for me.

499
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,103
Oh, sorry.

500
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:40,688
- Why does he get to go...?
- He's a VIP.

501
00:34:40,855 --> 00:34:46,027
So, what's that make me? A VUP?
A very unimportant person?

502
00:34:50,531 --> 00:34:52,742
I have a reservation.

503
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,956
Why don't you go on break, Jim?
I'll handle this guest.

504
00:34:59,123 --> 00:35:01,500
Hello, sir. Sorry for the wait.
Welcome to The Bank.

505
00:35:18,392 --> 00:35:20,561
Hello. Kensington Chubb here.

506
00:35:20,895 --> 00:35:25,900
<i>- Saul, it's me. He's in his room. Blast him.</i>
- Got it.

507
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,569
<i>Gloves and mask.</i>
<i>Don't take any chances.</i>

508
00:35:28,819 --> 00:35:30,071
<i>Got it.</i>

509
00:36:12,113 --> 00:36:13,531
Hello. Front desk.

510
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:20,371
Yes, I'm in room 1706, and there's
some sort of terrible smell in here.

511
00:36:20,538 --> 00:36:24,625
It smells like... Well, I need to move.

512
00:36:24,792 --> 00:36:27,628
Certainly, sir.
I'll see if we have anything available.

513
00:36:30,965 --> 00:36:33,884
I'm sorry, sir. We are booked
through the grand opening gala.

514
00:36:34,051 --> 00:36:35,886
I'll let you know
if anything opens up.

515
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:39,140
<i>- Enjoy your stay at The Bank. Goodbye.</i>
- But I...

516
00:36:46,772 --> 00:36:51,319
Let the VIP concierge know
that I'm ready to see all available rooms.

517
00:36:51,485 --> 00:36:53,487
- Right away, Mr. Chubb.
- Thank you.

518
00:36:53,654 --> 00:36:58,075
Her Highness is so very sensitive
to smells.

519
00:37:01,996 --> 00:37:03,289
If you keep complaining...

520
00:37:03,581 --> 00:37:06,208
...they will fire us all
just for listening.

521
00:37:06,834 --> 00:37:10,379
I'm just saying
the conditions are brutal.

522
00:37:11,881 --> 00:37:14,633
You can't disagree.

523
00:37:17,219 --> 00:37:19,221
The money... short.

524
00:37:19,597 --> 00:37:21,140
The hours... way too long.

525
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:23,225
That's Mexico, bro.

526
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:31,942
Have all of you
forgotten Zapata?

527
00:37:32,276 --> 00:37:34,403
When the poor
had their land stolen...

528
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:38,074
...they figured it was
lost for good.

529
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,160
But Zapata said
to them...

530
00:37:41,786 --> 00:37:44,622
It is better to die
on your feet...

531
00:37:44,789 --> 00:37:48,167
...than to live
on your knees.

532
00:37:49,919 --> 00:37:51,629
And they fought.

533
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:54,590
And they fought.

534
00:38:10,564 --> 00:38:15,569
Hello. I'd like a table for one.
I hear your risotto is tremendous.

535
00:38:15,903 --> 00:38:18,739
It is tremendous.
The name on the reservation?

536
00:38:19,073 --> 00:38:20,866
I'm a walk-in.

537
00:38:21,909 --> 00:38:24,412
I'm sorry, sir. I can't accommodate you.

538
00:38:27,081 --> 00:38:30,501
Those are reserved. May I recommend
one of our other restaurants?

539
00:38:30,668 --> 00:38:35,047
Ling Su.
Cantonese-inspired Szechuan cuisine.

540
00:38:35,256 --> 00:38:36,882
Great.

541
00:39:03,034 --> 00:39:06,203
Okay, it is not a prop for prop's sake.

542
00:39:07,288 --> 00:39:09,707
No, the Brody can work.

543
00:39:10,291 --> 00:39:13,419
Just because you have
the greatest cover known to man...

544
00:39:13,586 --> 00:39:17,465
...you don't even have to think about
these things anymore? Congratulations.

545
00:39:18,966 --> 00:39:21,302
No, maybe you're getting soft.

546
00:39:21,636 --> 00:39:23,804
No, I'm not gonna put Danny on.

547
00:39:24,221 --> 00:39:25,890
Or Rusty.

548
00:39:27,725 --> 00:39:29,644
Just... Goodbye, Dad.

549
00:39:31,062 --> 00:39:35,566
Okay. I rerouted all the impulses
going to the main randomizer.

550
00:39:35,733 --> 00:39:39,695
In blackjack, the best score
you can get is 21.

551
00:39:39,862 --> 00:39:42,406
It's called blackjack.
So the result should be...

552
00:39:42,573 --> 00:39:48,579
...20s and blackjacks to all the players,
with a dealer "bust."

553
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:54,335
Your cards. That's mine.

554
00:40:01,926 --> 00:40:04,261
Okay, do over. Do over.

555
00:40:17,441 --> 00:40:19,777
Okay, I'll keep working.

556
00:40:21,278 --> 00:40:23,656
- Good.
- Good.

557
00:40:24,615 --> 00:40:27,827
I'll have the dumplings
and the shiitake-mushroom tempura.

558
00:40:27,994 --> 00:40:30,329
- And a sparkling water.
- Okay.

559
00:41:16,834 --> 00:41:18,502
I'm gonna finish this.

560
00:41:23,007 --> 00:41:24,842
"Staff.

561
00:41:25,676 --> 00:41:27,428
Casino.

562
00:41:28,012 --> 00:41:29,680
Food.

563
00:41:30,181 --> 00:41:32,433
Room cleanliness."

564
00:42:09,553 --> 00:42:12,098
At this point, there's nothing
I can do to help him.

565
00:42:12,264 --> 00:42:15,101
You said that he'd be, whatchamacallit,
ambulatory by now.

566
00:42:15,643 --> 00:42:18,312
- Are you keeping his spirits buoyed?
- We're working on it.

567
00:42:18,479 --> 00:42:20,064
Thanks, Stan.

568
00:42:21,232 --> 00:42:25,069
No, no. That's way too much.
It's not like I removed a bullet.

569
00:42:25,319 --> 00:42:27,029
This time.

570
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:32,076
- Hey, Linus. How's it going?
- Dr. Stan. Great.

571
00:42:32,326 --> 00:42:33,577
- We're dead.
- What?

572
00:42:33,744 --> 00:42:35,913
- The factory in Mexico is offline.
- Offline?

573
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:39,583
- What does that mean exactly?
- I couldn't get details. It just shut down.

574
00:42:39,834 --> 00:42:42,503
- You don't think that he...?
- Yeah, I do.

575
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:06,110
So he says that they want their bread
and they want their roses too.

576
00:43:06,277 --> 00:43:08,529
You gotta get down there
and straighten this out.

577
00:43:08,779 --> 00:43:10,865
- But he doesn't listen to me.
- You're going.

578
00:43:11,032 --> 00:43:15,995
If we don't get this factory back online,
we're gonna have to dock this showboat.

579
00:43:18,539 --> 00:43:20,666
What he means is
the whole operation hinges...

580
00:43:20,833 --> 00:43:24,712
Dude, I got the showboat metaphor.
Thank you, Linus.

581
00:43:25,087 --> 00:43:28,299
- All right, I gotta get back.
- What?

582
00:43:28,633 --> 00:43:31,927
What do you mean, what?
A little something for the effort, maybe.

583
00:43:32,637 --> 00:43:35,181
We pool tips! The other guys
are gonna think I'm kiting.

584
00:43:35,348 --> 00:43:37,224
All right, okay, fine. Come on.

585
00:43:37,475 --> 00:43:40,978
- You want it to come out of my pocket?
- I ain't got money till I get my check.

586
00:43:41,145 --> 00:43:44,190
- Yeah?
- What is this?

587
00:43:44,357 --> 00:43:45,983
Take it easy. What's the problem?

588
00:43:46,817 --> 00:43:50,988
The tri-cone optimizers that feed
into the nipple-sleeve receivers...

589
00:43:51,238 --> 00:43:55,993
...perforated their lubricating bladders and
began punching against the side walls.

590
00:43:56,327 --> 00:44:00,414
Picture a knee, but without any cartilage.
Bone on bone.

591
00:44:00,581 --> 00:44:04,335
There's a shearing effect when alloys
of different density abrade.

592
00:44:04,502 --> 00:44:07,713
- The softer of the two...
<i>- Magnetizes, reversing polarization.</i>

593
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,507
<i>Where's that put us?</i>

594
00:44:11,676 --> 00:44:13,511
Cattled.

595
00:44:16,263 --> 00:44:19,850
Good news is, there's another B-600,
the one that dug the Chunnel.

596
00:44:20,017 --> 00:44:22,186
I thought we had the one
that dug the Chunnel.

597
00:44:22,353 --> 00:44:24,355
- We did.
- This one dug from the French side.

598
00:44:24,522 --> 00:44:27,858
Bad news is, we're gonna
have to buy this one, and it's expensive.

599
00:44:28,025 --> 00:44:29,318
How much do we have left?

600
00:44:29,485 --> 00:44:31,988
If I tap the whole contingency,
just over 10 million.

601
00:44:32,154 --> 00:44:33,614
- How close does that get us?
- No.

602
00:44:33,864 --> 00:44:35,199
- How much is it?
- Thirty...

603
00:44:35,366 --> 00:44:37,284
- Thirty?
...six.

604
00:44:37,535 --> 00:44:39,203
Thirty-six?

605
00:44:39,829 --> 00:44:43,874
- There's no way to do it without the drill?
- The drill's the exit strategy.

606
00:44:44,041 --> 00:44:47,545
Well, is there a way
for us to raise money?

607
00:44:47,712 --> 00:44:49,714
I've got everything
I have in this already.

608
00:44:49,964 --> 00:44:51,215
- So do I.
- Me too.

609
00:44:51,382 --> 00:44:52,717
We all do.

610
00:44:57,805 --> 00:45:01,976
If any one of us was lying up in that bed,
Reuben wouldn't rest till he made it right.

611
00:45:02,226 --> 00:45:06,147
I gotta go up there and tell him we failed,
and there's nothing we can do about it?

612
00:45:10,318 --> 00:45:12,653
- So we're stopping?
- I'm not saying that.

613
00:45:12,903 --> 00:45:14,613
So, what, then?

614
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:24,415
Mr. Reuben is talking.
He ask for Mr. Danny.

615
00:45:30,087 --> 00:45:33,424
- Rusty.
- I don't wanna go. No.

616
00:45:38,262 --> 00:45:40,681
I hear cars pulling in.

617
00:45:40,848 --> 00:45:45,603
I hear whispering conversations.
Linus crying.

618
00:45:46,103 --> 00:45:49,440
Why don't you tell me
what everyone else seems to know?

619
00:45:52,109 --> 00:45:54,862
- Well, we came in here to...
- The thing is...

620
00:45:55,029 --> 00:45:56,781
Wait, wait.

621
00:45:57,782 --> 00:46:00,451
Hi, Reuben.
Good to see you smiling again.

622
00:46:01,869 --> 00:46:03,621
Can I talk to you guys for a second?

623
00:46:03,788 --> 00:46:05,289
That's your idea?

624
00:46:06,123 --> 00:46:11,128
We've shaken all the trees, we've looked
under every rock, we've searched every...

625
00:46:11,879 --> 00:46:14,340
We've talked to everybody
we can trust.

626
00:46:14,507 --> 00:46:16,425
It's not a great idea, but it is an idea.

627
00:46:16,592 --> 00:46:19,553
I think as long as we have one idea,
we shouldn't give up.

628
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:25,643
I was really hoping
to avoid that this time.

629
00:46:32,149 --> 00:46:33,776
Number one:

630
00:46:34,485 --> 00:46:37,905
If any of you try to screw me,
you'll be dead.

631
00:46:38,322 --> 00:46:40,825
I'm gonna be looking in
on the operation to make sure.

632
00:46:40,992 --> 00:46:44,537
Number two: If I lend you this money,
I'm your senior partner.

633
00:46:44,704 --> 00:46:49,166
Last money in, first money out.
And you will double my investment.

634
00:46:50,001 --> 00:46:51,585
Double.

635
00:46:55,006 --> 00:46:57,925
- Was that a yes?
- Double.

636
00:47:04,015 --> 00:47:08,436
That monstrosity that Bank calls a hotel
casts a shadow over my pool.

637
00:47:09,854 --> 00:47:11,105
Break him.

638
00:47:12,189 --> 00:47:16,402
Break him in half. The man has no taste.
Yet, every time he opens a hotel...

639
00:47:16,569 --> 00:47:20,448
...he wins a Royal Review Board
Five Diamond Award.

640
00:47:21,449 --> 00:47:24,243
Every time he wins a Five Diamond
Award, he celebrates by...

641
00:47:24,410 --> 00:47:26,537
<i>We know. By buying one for his wife.</i>

642
00:47:26,704 --> 00:47:29,081
- You mean five.
- One is five.

643
00:47:30,041 --> 00:47:31,751
Number three:

644
00:47:33,711 --> 00:47:35,504
I want you to steal the diamonds.

645
00:47:37,048 --> 00:47:39,050
- Can't be done.
- We don't have the manpower.

646
00:47:39,216 --> 00:47:40,426
- Or the time.
- Or a way in.

647
00:47:40,593 --> 00:47:43,804
If we get caught, we go away for life.
We won't risk that for you.

648
00:47:44,055 --> 00:47:47,725
They're not for me. I just want him
to lose what matters most to him.

649
00:47:47,892 --> 00:47:49,852
Do what you want with them.

650
00:47:50,061 --> 00:47:52,563
But either you steal the diamonds...

651
00:47:53,064 --> 00:47:55,816
...or you find somebody else
to finance your drill.

652
00:47:58,569 --> 00:47:59,779
LA FOREUSE B600

653
00:47:59,945 --> 00:48:03,491
(The one that dug from the French side.)

654
00:48:03,658 --> 00:48:05,368
What's the deal with these diamonds?

655
00:48:05,534 --> 00:48:08,996
They're Tiffany, they're 30 carats each,
matching the awards plaques.

656
00:48:09,246 --> 00:48:12,583
On today's legitimate market,
they'd be worth $250 million.

657
00:48:12,833 --> 00:48:16,337
Bank's already purchased the next one
in anticipation of winning the award.

658
00:48:16,587 --> 00:48:20,508
The rest are kept in a secure glass
viewing booth at the top of the tower.

659
00:48:20,675 --> 00:48:23,177
- Benedict said we can keep them?
- That's what he said.

660
00:48:23,344 --> 00:48:26,097
Then why weren't these diamonds
on the agenda to begin with?

661
00:48:26,263 --> 00:48:28,099
Because it can't be done.

662
00:48:28,599 --> 00:48:30,935
This is why revenge jobs
don't work, Daniel.

663
00:48:31,185 --> 00:48:34,855
You put yourself in a position, you know
you should walk away, but you can't.

664
00:48:35,106 --> 00:48:38,693
- This is how guys die or go to jail.
- All right.

665
00:48:38,943 --> 00:48:40,611
Anybody wanna walk away?

666
00:48:43,364 --> 00:48:46,283
- Saul?
- I didn't say I was walking away.

667
00:48:46,450 --> 00:48:48,119
Let's gut the son of a bitch.

668
00:48:49,787 --> 00:48:53,040
Okay. Now, Bank fired Gehry,
Gwathmey, Meier, four others...

669
00:48:53,207 --> 00:48:55,710
...just so he could say
he designed the hotel himself.

670
00:48:55,876 --> 00:48:58,838
What this means to us:
There's no set of unified plans.

671
00:48:59,297 --> 00:49:00,548
Routes?

672
00:49:00,715 --> 00:49:05,136
According to March '05 plans, there's
interior shafts with potential access...

673
00:49:05,303 --> 00:49:08,055
...to the diamond viewing room here,
here and here.

674
00:49:08,556 --> 00:49:11,142
But the May '05 plans
only show shafts here and here.

675
00:49:11,309 --> 00:49:13,477
September '05 shows no shafts.

676
00:49:13,644 --> 00:49:15,479
December '06
are the same as March '05.

677
00:49:15,646 --> 00:49:18,774
- How many sets of plans are there?
- That's 10.

678
00:49:20,026 --> 00:49:22,528
Since we can't trust
the accuracy of these drawings...

679
00:49:22,695 --> 00:49:26,657
...based on my walking around, these are
the shafts we have to clap an eyeball on.

680
00:49:26,907 --> 00:49:29,577
Now, there's no way of knowing
the thickness of the floor.

681
00:49:29,827 --> 00:49:32,872
Anything thicker than 5 inches,
we got a problem.

682
00:49:34,415 --> 00:49:36,584
This here is the elevator shaft...

683
00:49:36,834 --> 00:49:40,755
...which can be accessed through
a super-high-roller villa. Got it?

684
00:49:41,756 --> 00:49:44,675
All right. So who's gonna be
our super-high roller?

685
00:50:07,239 --> 00:50:09,575
I'm so sorry
to have been a little tardy, Mr...?

686
00:50:09,742 --> 00:50:13,037
Pepperidge, Lenny Pepperidge.
I'm Mr. Weng's communicator.

687
00:50:13,287 --> 00:50:16,374
He'd like you to know
that he was waiting for 7 minutes.

688
00:50:16,874 --> 00:50:21,295
We received your $ 10 million cash
deposit. I'd like you to know that we...

689
00:50:21,545 --> 00:50:25,549
Mr. Weng won't take a line.
He's a man of extraordinary discipline.

690
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:28,135
He's willing to risk 10 million,
not a dollar more.

691
00:50:28,386 --> 00:50:31,722
- Did you say Mr. Weng was in real estate?
- That's right.

692
00:50:31,889 --> 00:50:35,309
I only ask because his name doesn't
come up on our standard file database.

693
00:50:35,559 --> 00:50:38,729
And Mr. Weng and I have worked
very hard to keep it that way.

694
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:42,900
Exactly what kind of real estate did
you say that Mr. Weng was involved in?

695
00:50:43,067 --> 00:50:48,364
- Look, he owns all the air south of Beijing.
- The air?

696
00:50:48,531 --> 00:50:49,740
Put it to you this way:

697
00:50:49,907 --> 00:50:53,411
Try building something larger than
three stories in the Tianjin province...

698
00:50:53,577 --> 00:50:56,080
...see if his name comes up
in your database then.

699
00:50:58,165 --> 00:51:01,419
How quickly can you transfer his money
to the cage at the Bellagio?

700
00:51:01,585 --> 00:51:04,088
I don't think that's necessary at all,
Mr. Pepperidge.

701
00:51:04,255 --> 00:51:07,800
We have reserved our largest villa
for Mr. Weng.

702
00:51:20,187 --> 00:51:21,856
Carson City, NV

703
00:51:22,106 --> 00:51:24,275
Extension 765.

704
00:51:24,525 --> 00:51:26,569
<i>Hello, Robert. This is Abigail Sponder.</i>

705
00:51:26,736 --> 00:51:31,282
<i>Your bureau chief introduced us not too</i>
<i>long ago at the Gaming Fraud Seminar.</i>

706
00:51:32,283 --> 00:51:35,077
I remember you.
What can I do for you, Ms. Sponder?

707
00:51:35,244 --> 00:51:37,079
We're about to open the new property...

708
00:51:37,246 --> 00:51:40,333
...and there are a couple of characters
here I'm not too sure about.

709
00:51:40,708 --> 00:51:43,085
Give me their names,
and I'll check them out.

710
00:51:55,890 --> 00:51:57,725
Up you go.

711
00:51:59,644 --> 00:52:01,103
- What do you mean?
- You gotta go.

712
00:52:02,063 --> 00:52:03,356
Too fast?

713
00:52:03,522 --> 00:52:06,025
You did the bullet-train stunt
with all Asia watching.

714
00:52:06,192 --> 00:52:07,985
The elevators aren't faster than that.

715
00:52:09,654 --> 00:52:12,948
- That was CGI?
- Wait, so those weren't your legs?

716
00:52:13,908 --> 00:52:15,576
- Wow.
- Jesus.

717
00:52:16,369 --> 00:52:19,413
Okay, then. We're down again.

718
00:52:20,331 --> 00:52:22,625
Well, what about Reuben?

719
00:52:23,918 --> 00:52:26,253
- There's hospice.
- Assisted living.

720
00:52:26,504 --> 00:52:28,839
We could pay somebody to read to him.

721
00:52:29,090 --> 00:52:30,925
Maybe he'll see his next birthday.

722
00:52:31,425 --> 00:52:35,596
- January? I don't think so.
- Shit.

723
00:52:38,057 --> 00:52:40,601
Shit, shit, shit.

724
00:53:24,645 --> 00:53:25,980
Shit.

725
00:53:31,736 --> 00:53:33,529
And then what happened?

726
00:53:33,696 --> 00:53:36,407
- She said she liked surprises.
- That's not what she meant.

727
00:53:36,574 --> 00:53:37,825
You think?

728
00:53:38,159 --> 00:53:39,827
So she put down the remote.

729
00:53:39,994 --> 00:53:43,581
- And I put the towel back on.
- Well, those are the waters.

730
00:53:44,999 --> 00:53:47,001
- Relationships can be...
- Sure.

731
00:53:47,335 --> 00:53:49,754
- But they're also...
- That's right.

732
00:53:52,214 --> 00:53:55,760
I've gone through so many blueprints,
I can taste the ink through my fingers.

733
00:53:56,427 --> 00:53:59,263
The only other access
is through the air conditioning duct.

734
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:02,099
- We gotta move that guard.
- We don't have anything on him.

735
00:54:02,266 --> 00:54:05,436
- Then let's find something.
- I can get to the helipad from there too.

736
00:54:05,686 --> 00:54:07,521
Let's find something.

737
00:54:10,858 --> 00:54:13,194
I remember when
this used to be the Dunes.

738
00:54:15,196 --> 00:54:18,741
Reuben taught me to shoot craps here
when I was a kid.

739
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:24,288
I'd play hard ways and double sixes.
He straightened me out.

740
00:54:24,872 --> 00:54:29,460
I was 22.

741
00:54:31,212 --> 00:54:32,880
First time I met Reuben...

742
00:54:33,130 --> 00:54:37,635
...he looked me off getting cheated
at an all-dealers game at the El Rancho.

743
00:54:37,802 --> 00:54:39,971
Then he bought me breakfast.

744
00:54:43,224 --> 00:54:47,311
The Sands was there, Desert Inn.

745
00:54:48,562 --> 00:54:53,317
- They built them a lot smaller back then.
- They seemed pretty big.

746
00:54:54,986 --> 00:54:57,029
Town's changed.

747
00:56:06,474 --> 00:56:11,937
<i>If I read one more puff piece</i>
<i>about Vegas legend Terry Benedict...</i>

748
00:56:12,104 --> 00:56:14,398
<i>... I'm gonna have to buy a magazine</i>
<i>of my own.</i>

749
00:56:14,565 --> 00:56:16,651
<i>And I haven't forgotten</i>
<i>about that phone.</i>

750
00:56:16,984 --> 00:56:19,236
<i>The gold model?</i>
<i>The one that retails for 10,000?</i>

751
00:56:19,487 --> 00:56:21,572
<i>That's the one.</i>
<i>That top-of-the-line Samsung.</i>

752
00:56:21,822 --> 00:56:24,909
<i>Okay, that would be ungettable.</i>

753
00:56:25,076 --> 00:56:27,244
<i>No, no. You call Teddy Sanders</i>
<i>in Promotions.</i>

754
00:56:27,411 --> 00:56:30,831
<i>I did that.</i>
<i>He promised you the very first one...</i>

755
00:56:30,998 --> 00:56:33,417
<i>... as soon as it comes off</i>
<i>the line in September.</i>

756
00:56:33,668 --> 00:56:38,339
<i>Well, that's July for me.</i>
<i>You just make it happen.</i>

757
00:56:42,343 --> 00:56:43,678
What'd he say about Samsung?

758
00:56:43,928 --> 00:56:46,847
He said he used to bowl
with the owner of Samsung.

759
00:56:48,516 --> 00:56:50,184
Well, call Danny.

760
00:56:50,518 --> 00:56:55,439
Oh, and tell Danny I know the perfect guy
we can use for the roper at the Expo.

761
00:57:04,865 --> 00:57:07,368
I thought we were addressing this.

762
00:57:07,618 --> 00:57:11,330
- We were. We are. Randall is.
- I must've put too much...

763
00:57:11,497 --> 00:57:15,376
Don't blame yourself.
He should've fired you a week ago.

764
00:57:16,377 --> 00:57:17,962
Bye.

765
00:57:22,049 --> 00:57:24,093
Are you having a nice day?

766
00:57:27,555 --> 00:57:31,058
And you, sir?
How's your Bank experience?

767
00:57:31,225 --> 00:57:34,895
- Well, it's...
- Can I be of personal assistance to you?

768
00:57:36,731 --> 00:57:39,233
This is quite unorthodox.

769
00:57:39,734 --> 00:57:43,821
I have never found myself
talking directly to a hotel owner.

770
00:57:44,572 --> 00:57:47,074
I understand. You're just a customer.

771
00:57:47,408 --> 00:57:50,036
And I'm just an engaged innkeeper.

772
00:57:50,202 --> 00:57:52,663
- Spot on.
- Spot on.

773
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:56,709
Well, so far, in my book...

774
00:57:57,084 --> 00:57:59,920
...this establishment is aces.

775
00:58:00,755 --> 00:58:04,759
Aces? That's good.
The ace of diamonds...

776
00:58:05,092 --> 00:58:06,427
...I hope.

777
00:58:07,094 --> 00:58:10,514
I see what you're...
Diamonds, indeed. Yes!

778
00:58:11,182 --> 00:58:13,726
<i>- Your apartment with everything</i>
<i>that we like.</i>

779
00:58:13,893 --> 00:58:18,064
<i>A lovely new living room</i>
<i>from Walter E. Smithe.</i>

780
00:58:22,026 --> 00:58:23,277
- Hey.
- Hey.

781
00:58:23,444 --> 00:58:28,199
The guard by the elevator shaft has a
little Hitler for a son. A real Ritalin sniffer.

782
00:58:28,366 --> 00:58:31,619
- You okay?
- Yeah, no, I just bit into a pepper, and...

783
00:58:32,370 --> 00:58:33,621
Anyway...

784
00:58:34,455 --> 00:58:36,457
Is that...?

785
00:58:36,624 --> 00:58:38,084
Are you...?

786
00:58:39,961 --> 00:58:42,213
Are you watching <i>Oprah?</i>

787
00:58:43,297 --> 00:58:45,633
With a bottle of wine?

788
00:58:46,133 --> 00:58:48,469
- Did you TiVo this?
- I was reading the paper.

789
00:58:48,719 --> 00:58:50,221
With the sound at full volume?

790
00:58:50,763 --> 00:58:53,391
<i>Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.</i>
<i>Hold on, hold on.</i>

791
00:58:53,557 --> 00:58:58,479
<i>And not one, not two, not three,</i>
<i>but 12 new beds.</i>

792
00:59:10,491 --> 00:59:14,161
It's not just about the kids.
I mean, I'm happy for the kids.

793
00:59:14,495 --> 00:59:17,039
<i>I think we've come up</i>
<i>with the answer to your prayers.</i>

794
00:59:17,206 --> 00:59:20,167
<i>This is what I think we're gonna do.</i>
<i>We are buying you a house!</i>

795
00:59:20,418 --> 00:59:22,044
How's it going in Mexico?

796
00:59:24,171 --> 00:59:26,090
Well, Turk's there.

797
00:59:26,841 --> 00:59:28,843
Are they really gonna build her
a new home?

798
00:59:29,010 --> 00:59:30,970
Yeah, for the whole family.

799
00:59:47,028 --> 00:59:48,279
Then what did you say?

800
00:59:48,446 --> 00:59:50,114
- What could I say?
- Nothing.

801
00:59:50,364 --> 00:59:52,283
That's what I said.

802
00:59:52,450 --> 00:59:53,909
Hey.

803
00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:58,539
- You guys been talking to my father?
- Why would we do that?

804
00:59:58,873 --> 01:00:00,875
That's not a no.

805
01:00:02,668 --> 01:00:05,004
He just wanted to know how
the nose was working.

806
01:00:05,171 --> 01:00:08,132
Oh, I knew it, man.
He just can't leave it alone.

807
01:00:09,216 --> 01:00:11,802
- What'd you say?
- Oh, I told him the nose plays.

808
01:00:12,053 --> 01:00:13,471
- The nose does play.
- It plays.

809
01:00:13,638 --> 01:00:15,306
- It's great.
- It's huge.

810
01:00:15,556 --> 01:00:19,310
Turk? Hey, are you gonna
get the factory open?

811
01:00:19,477 --> 01:00:22,146
Hell, yes!
We just gotta break management!

812
01:00:22,396 --> 01:00:24,899
They can't keep treating us like this!

813
01:00:25,232 --> 01:00:27,234
Well, I gotta go!

814
01:01:00,267 --> 01:01:04,188
- Ortega here. Oh, no.
<i>- Mr. Ortega, this is Vice Principal Meckler.</i>

815
01:01:04,355 --> 01:01:08,150
I'm afraid so. We've had another incident
with Manny and Ms. Kelso.

816
01:01:08,317 --> 01:01:09,652
It was the leg this time.

817
01:01:09,819 --> 01:01:11,904
We need somebody to come down
and pick him up.

818
01:01:12,071 --> 01:01:14,991
- My wife can't...?
<i>- We're not able to get a hold of her.</i>

819
01:01:15,157 --> 01:01:16,867
<i>We've left messages.</i>

820
01:01:18,119 --> 01:01:21,872
Yo, yo, yo! Buddy, buddy! Do me
a favor. Cover my post for half an hour.

821
01:01:22,039 --> 01:01:23,499
I was just about to go on break.

822
01:01:23,666 --> 01:01:26,585
Come on, man. Help me out.
My kid just bit the lunch lady again.

823
01:01:27,086 --> 01:01:29,380
- Yeah, all right.
- All right, man, I owe you one.

824
01:01:29,547 --> 01:01:31,090
Yeah, you do.

825
01:02:08,836 --> 01:02:10,254
All right.

826
01:02:10,421 --> 01:02:12,340
According to this...

827
01:02:13,341 --> 01:02:15,676
...the room where
the diamonds are held...

828
01:02:16,177 --> 01:02:18,512
...is directly above here.

829
01:02:35,029 --> 01:02:37,114
<i>A quarter billion dollars' worth</i>
<i>of diamonds...</i>

830
01:02:37,281 --> 01:02:39,742
<i>... and 18 inches of poured concrete</i>
<i>in the way.</i>

831
01:02:40,451 --> 01:02:42,161
<i>Man, we can't drill through that.</i>

832
01:02:45,873 --> 01:02:47,375
<i>It's just one thing too many.</i>

833
01:02:47,625 --> 01:02:49,835
<i>We're talking about</i>
<i>a secure room, Terry.</i>

834
01:02:50,002 --> 01:02:52,421
This isn't a glass box
these diamonds are housed in.

835
01:02:52,588 --> 01:02:54,799
This is 2-inch-thick,
concussion-proof glass.

836
01:02:55,049 --> 01:02:58,219
Wired with pressure-sensitive
7-digit coded alarms.

837
01:02:58,719 --> 01:03:01,305
Kill the power to the hotel.
It's worked for you before.

838
01:03:01,472 --> 01:03:04,642
No, see, the case and the alarm
both have independent power supply.

839
01:03:04,809 --> 01:03:08,980
And besides, you don't run the same
gag twice. You do the next gag.

840
01:03:11,065 --> 01:03:14,360
How big a deal is it
if we don't get the diamonds?

841
01:03:15,903 --> 01:03:17,697
You have all your affairs in order?

842
01:03:19,490 --> 01:03:21,909
All right. So, what we have to do is...

843
01:03:22,326 --> 01:03:26,163
...get inside that glass case
and switch in the replicas.

844
01:03:26,330 --> 01:03:29,834
How are we supposed to get in the room?
Bank is the only one with access.

845
01:03:30,001 --> 01:03:32,211
- Sponder has too.
- Sponder has access?

846
01:03:32,378 --> 01:03:34,171
Then we're in.

847
01:03:34,922 --> 01:03:37,008
Sponder's a...

848
01:03:37,591 --> 01:03:40,261
Well, I believe the term is "cougar."

849
01:03:43,097 --> 01:03:46,267
It's not my term.
I read about it in <i>Maxim</i> magazine.

850
01:03:49,103 --> 01:03:50,855
Okay. Let's get Rusty in position...

851
01:03:51,105 --> 01:03:53,274
No, not Rusty. Me.
I'm already in there.

852
01:03:53,441 --> 01:03:56,861
I put this whole thing in motion
before I even realized it.

853
01:03:57,111 --> 01:04:00,906
I'm so deep into Pepperidge,
I don't even think. I just react. I am him.

854
01:04:02,033 --> 01:04:04,577
You know what? Okay, great. Great.

855
01:04:04,744 --> 01:04:06,704
Would you just tell them?

856
01:04:08,372 --> 01:04:10,082
Oh, now you don't understand English?

857
01:04:13,711 --> 01:04:16,756
She was not trying not to laugh.
You know what?

858
01:04:17,381 --> 01:04:20,301
- I can do it.
- He says he can do it.

859
01:04:21,135 --> 01:04:24,805
All right, Linus, go get her.
Give him the accelerator.

860
01:04:24,972 --> 01:04:27,892
- Natural? Chemical?
- I don't need an accelerator.

861
01:04:28,059 --> 01:04:29,560
- Make it powerful.
- Thanks a lot.

862
01:04:29,727 --> 01:04:31,312
- I'll fly in a Gilroy.
- Get two.

863
01:04:31,646 --> 01:04:35,066
- You don't need it.
- Just one Gilroy. Last time you did two...

864
01:04:35,232 --> 01:04:38,653
News from Mexico.
From a <i>journalista</i> I used to...

865
01:04:38,903 --> 01:04:42,406
She's an ally of the workers.
What she tells me...

866
01:04:42,657 --> 01:04:45,076
...is that the strike hinges
on working conditions...

867
01:04:45,242 --> 01:04:48,746
...and the fact that labor feels
they're underpaid by 50 percent.

868
01:04:49,330 --> 01:04:52,917
I'm sure you'll agree, Terry,
it's always about the money.

869
01:04:53,167 --> 01:04:54,669
How much are we talking about?

870
01:04:54,835 --> 01:04:56,671
- Thirty-six thousand.
- How many workers?

871
01:04:56,837 --> 01:04:59,507
- Two hundred, give or take.
- All right, that's...

872
01:04:59,674 --> 01:05:01,175
Just over 7 million dollars.

873
01:05:01,425 --> 01:05:06,013
No, no. Not 36 K per person. 36 total.

874
01:05:07,181 --> 01:05:10,685
Turk and Virgil got them holding out
for $3.50 a week?

875
01:05:11,018 --> 01:05:14,188
- It is a 5-percent increase.
- We'll write them a check.

876
01:05:16,941 --> 01:05:18,234
We'll post-date it.

877
01:06:20,588 --> 01:06:23,966
Remember, tell my
brother "hang tough."

878
01:06:39,106 --> 01:06:40,691
<i>This is Roman Nagel.</i>

879
01:06:41,108 --> 01:06:44,779
<i>If your consciousness</i>
<i>absolutely has to intrude upon mine...</i>

880
01:06:45,446 --> 01:06:46,947
<i>... leave me a message.</i>

881
01:06:47,198 --> 01:06:49,533
Hey, Roman? It's Livingston.

882
01:06:50,117 --> 01:06:54,914
I heard you were out here, taking
some meetings, and I was wondering...

883
01:06:55,081 --> 01:06:57,041
...if you could help me out...

884
01:06:57,291 --> 01:07:01,796
...with a technical problem I've been
having with one of my assignments.

885
01:07:02,213 --> 01:07:06,467
And I was hoping that we could,
you know, keep it on the down low...

886
01:07:06,801 --> 01:07:10,930
...from Danny and the other guys,
that I'm coming to you for help.

887
01:07:12,139 --> 01:07:14,976
So call me when you get this. Okay?

888
01:07:15,393 --> 01:07:16,894
Okay.

889
01:07:17,061 --> 01:07:18,312
Bye.

890
01:07:26,570 --> 01:07:28,155
Was Sponder with him?

891
01:07:28,823 --> 01:07:31,826
- "A whole new segment."
- Which car?

892
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:36,163
- Which Rolls?
- "Exclusive rights."

893
01:07:36,414 --> 01:07:38,291
What's the ETA?

894
01:07:38,666 --> 01:07:41,085
- "In Tunica, Mississippi."
- Okay.

895
01:07:41,252 --> 01:07:42,503
He's on his way.

896
01:07:43,087 --> 01:07:46,507
- Think he's gonna fall for this?
- You did.

897
01:07:46,757 --> 01:07:48,426
You ready?

898
01:07:49,176 --> 01:07:51,012
I was born ready.

899
01:08:07,194 --> 01:08:08,612
Who advanced this?

900
01:08:08,779 --> 01:08:11,073
Did I not say he was
to have this room to himself?

901
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:13,868
And what part of that
did you not understand?

902
01:08:14,035 --> 01:08:16,537
How are you?
I caught your show. That kid is great.

903
01:08:16,704 --> 01:08:19,874
Thank you for that. Congratulations
on the enormity of your success.

904
01:08:20,124 --> 01:08:22,501
- Back at you.
- Love and respect. Peace.

905
01:08:22,668 --> 01:08:25,171
Good seeing you, Bernie.

906
01:08:25,338 --> 01:08:28,549
Allow me to introduce to you
the greatest advance in gaming...

907
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:33,554
...since pari-mutuel wagering.
Get beyond boring cards and tired dice.

908
01:08:33,721 --> 01:08:38,559
It's electrifying! It's exciting!
It's 'Nuff Said!

909
01:08:38,726 --> 01:08:40,227
Yes, sir.

910
01:08:41,062 --> 01:08:44,899
Oh, my God. Mr. Bank. It's an honor, sir.

911
01:08:45,149 --> 01:08:48,694
May I please give you a demonstration
of casino dominoes?

912
01:08:48,861 --> 01:08:50,571
House edge 14 percent.

913
01:08:50,905 --> 01:08:52,990
- Is this documented?
- Of course.

914
01:08:53,157 --> 01:08:56,410
The action makes the player feel
like they have a fighting chance...

915
01:08:56,577 --> 01:08:59,705
...if you understand my meaning.
Check it out, ladies and gentlemen.

916
01:08:59,872 --> 01:09:02,667
Mr. Bank is gonna give
a young and upcoming gamer a chance.

917
01:09:02,833 --> 01:09:06,420
Give him a warm applause.
Come on now!

918
01:09:06,921 --> 01:09:10,341
- All right. Make it quick.
- Thank you, sir.

919
01:09:10,508 --> 01:09:14,929
Mr. Bank. First round of betting.
Next, dominoes!

920
01:09:15,262 --> 01:09:18,766
Second round of betting.
Upcoming, community dominoes.

921
01:09:19,016 --> 01:09:23,020
Mr. Bank, if a player wins on
a multiple of five on the first spin...

922
01:09:23,270 --> 01:09:25,272
...he or she is a winner.

923
01:09:25,606 --> 01:09:28,734
Payout, 5-to-1. But guess what.

924
01:09:29,610 --> 01:09:31,862
They're already laying 11 -to-1.

925
01:09:32,113 --> 01:09:35,491
So when they win, Mr. Bank, we win.

926
01:09:35,950 --> 01:09:37,702
'Nuff Said.

927
01:09:38,536 --> 01:09:40,204
That is good.

928
01:09:40,371 --> 01:09:43,457
I tell you what. Why don't you
send me some of your literature...

929
01:09:43,624 --> 01:09:45,710
...and we'll see what we can do.

930
01:09:45,876 --> 01:09:48,212
Literature, literature. Mr. Bank, come on.

931
01:09:48,462 --> 01:09:52,258
You don't need to read no literature.
All you need to do is feel it!

932
01:09:52,425 --> 01:09:57,138
Well, I feel it. It's just that I don't know
if it's bankable. All right?

933
01:09:57,388 --> 01:09:58,431
Bankable?

934
01:09:58,639 --> 01:10:01,309
I'd like to place this game
in one of my casinos.

935
01:10:01,642 --> 01:10:04,895
Now, that's what I'm talking about.
That's progressive thinking.

936
01:10:06,314 --> 01:10:10,484
I embrace the fact that 'Nuff Said might
grow a whole new segment in my hotels.

937
01:10:10,651 --> 01:10:12,069
Hello!

938
01:10:12,236 --> 01:10:15,948
And I'd like to lock this up right now.
Exclusive rights.

939
01:10:17,116 --> 01:10:20,286
I wanna place this beautiful domino table
at our Tunica location.

940
01:10:21,078 --> 01:10:23,956
Mississippi? That's where
games go to die, isn't it?

941
01:10:24,123 --> 01:10:26,083
Stay out of this, Bank.
You already passed.

942
01:10:26,250 --> 01:10:29,253
Really? Then do for him
what I'm prepared to.

943
01:10:30,004 --> 01:10:34,592
Prime placement, center room, Vegas,
tonight.

944
01:10:55,279 --> 01:10:58,449
Mr. Bank has three minutes,
you've got one. Go!

945
01:10:58,616 --> 01:11:00,451
Well, there'll be a series of brocades.

946
01:11:00,618 --> 01:11:03,371
Then the dahlia shells,
weeping willows, tiger tails...

947
01:11:03,537 --> 01:11:07,124
- Whoa, whoa. When's the jump?
- The motorcycle guy?

948
01:11:07,291 --> 01:11:11,045
Mr. Roads will jump his motorcycle
through the fireworks and over the Bank...

949
01:11:11,295 --> 01:11:14,465
You guys gotta get together on this.
Fireworks and stunts.

950
01:11:14,715 --> 01:11:16,384
You gotta be on the same page.

951
01:11:16,634 --> 01:11:20,304
All eyes of Vegas are gonna be on me.
It's gotta be perfect.

952
01:11:20,638 --> 01:11:22,390
All right. So take it from the top.

953
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:26,394
- Yes, sir. Around about 12:00...
- No, not around about. At 12.

954
01:11:26,727 --> 01:11:30,064
The stroke of midnight.
Go off the Navy master clock.

955
01:11:30,398 --> 01:11:33,234
Oh, don't make a maniac out of me.

956
01:11:42,076 --> 01:11:45,413
- Where the hell are they going?
- I don't really know what's happening.

957
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:49,834
We've just lost two dozen of our
biggest players without an explanation.

958
01:11:50,251 --> 01:11:52,336
Well, get an explanation!

959
01:11:58,676 --> 01:12:02,263
Ms. Sponder, this just came in.
Rush express. Hand-delivered.

960
01:12:05,391 --> 01:12:09,603
Oh, thank you. Thank you! Thanks.

961
01:12:10,104 --> 01:12:11,981
My pleasure.

962
01:12:36,130 --> 01:12:37,840
Guys. Let's go.

963
01:12:46,223 --> 01:12:50,645
<i>My dear Mr. B., this is a thank you</i>
<i>for all that you've given me.</i>

964
01:12:50,978 --> 01:12:55,316
<i>The opportunity, the kindness,</i>
<i>the warmth, the ch...</i>

965
01:12:56,984 --> 01:12:59,236
The one you couldn't get, huh?

966
01:13:00,571 --> 01:13:03,115
The one you couldn't get.

967
01:13:33,771 --> 01:13:36,565
THE GRAND
OPENING

968
01:14:51,599 --> 01:14:55,811
- How did Ocean get all my big players?
- Would you like me to have him removed?

969
01:14:57,355 --> 01:14:59,231
They'll all go with him.

970
01:15:02,568 --> 01:15:05,029
- Hey.
- How are the matches?

971
01:15:05,196 --> 01:15:07,198
Why don't you come see for yourself?

972
01:15:41,649 --> 01:15:42,984
All right.

973
01:15:43,150 --> 01:15:46,821
Why don't you give me one reason
not to bounce your ass out of my place?

974
01:15:46,988 --> 01:15:50,700
You know the reasons. You already
decided before you walked over here.

975
01:15:50,992 --> 01:15:53,661
They were all booked here.
You took them.

976
01:15:53,995 --> 01:15:57,665
What did you do, bribe them?
Buy them? Trick them?

977
01:15:57,999 --> 01:15:59,583
Yes.

978
01:15:59,834 --> 01:16:02,336
You brought them here
to rub it in my face.

979
01:16:03,671 --> 01:16:07,675
You know, you're half-smart, Ocean.

980
01:16:09,010 --> 01:16:13,014
Why don't you get real smart?
Let them play here...

981
01:16:13,514 --> 01:16:16,183
...and I'll give you 10 percent
of their losses.

982
01:16:17,601 --> 01:16:22,189
- You give it to Reuben if it'll make you...
- I'm not that easy. You almost killed him.

983
01:16:22,690 --> 01:16:26,193
Twenty percent
whenever they gamble here.

984
01:16:26,694 --> 01:16:28,321
Twenty?

985
01:16:29,613 --> 01:16:31,490
So it's done?

986
01:16:32,283 --> 01:16:35,870
- How do I know you won't...?
- We cash out every night, settle in cash.

987
01:16:36,203 --> 01:16:38,831
Otherwise, take them back again.

988
01:16:41,042 --> 01:16:44,712
- They'll need villas.
- Villas?

989
01:16:46,213 --> 01:16:47,965
Okay.

990
01:16:51,385 --> 01:16:53,137
Let's go, boys.

991
01:16:53,387 --> 01:16:57,391
There we go. All right.
Let's hit the tables.

992
01:16:57,558 --> 01:17:01,520
<i>But I say, why not feel it?</i>
<i>Why not feel the rush?</i>

993
01:17:01,687 --> 01:17:03,356
<i>Come on. Take a trip.</i>

994
01:17:03,522 --> 01:17:05,483
<i>Shake my hand. Who knows?</i>

995
01:17:06,233 --> 01:17:09,820
<i>Maybe you have what it takes</i>
<i>to break The Bank.</i>

996
01:17:17,078 --> 01:17:20,665
- Long past checkout time, sir.
- What? I'm in no condition to check out.

997
01:17:20,915 --> 01:17:23,501
You've overstayed your reservation.
We need the room.

998
01:17:23,668 --> 01:17:25,920
Innkeeper laws make it illegal
to evict a guest...

999
01:17:26,170 --> 01:17:28,297
Except in cases of public health
and safety...

1000
01:17:28,464 --> 01:17:33,386
...when the occupant evidences a
flagrant disregard for personal hygiene.

1001
01:17:33,552 --> 01:17:35,096
I haven't disregarded my hygiene.

1002
01:17:35,262 --> 01:17:37,390
- You have.
- Sir, what we're trying to say is...

1003
01:17:37,556 --> 01:17:39,350
...you've gone nose deaf.
- What?

1004
01:17:39,517 --> 01:17:41,686
You're oblivious to your effect
on other guests.

1005
01:17:41,852 --> 01:17:45,022
- I really don't see what effect...
- Fifteen minutes!

1006
01:17:45,189 --> 01:17:47,942
Fifteen minutes.
Hey, 15 minutes.

1007
01:17:48,275 --> 01:17:51,737
Pack your things or we will
pack them for you. Get the picture?

1008
01:17:51,904 --> 01:17:53,197
- What?
- Get the picture?

1009
01:17:53,364 --> 01:17:55,366
- Pack your things.
- Don't make us come back.

1010
01:17:55,533 --> 01:17:58,077
- Pack your things!
- Hey, okay.

1011
01:17:58,244 --> 01:17:59,704
Okay.

1012
01:18:09,046 --> 01:18:11,048
The Gilroy

1013
01:18:25,730 --> 01:18:30,151
- Well, hello there.
- There are no tomorrows, Mr. Pepperidge.

1014
01:18:54,175 --> 01:18:56,093
Call me Lenny.

1015
01:19:01,682 --> 01:19:03,809
I need this room.

1016
01:19:06,187 --> 01:19:08,939
I gave Mr. Chang a...

1017
01:19:10,691 --> 01:19:13,778
Mr. Weng a chance.

1018
01:19:17,865 --> 01:19:21,285
I need the Asian villas,
all the Asian villas.

1019
01:19:21,452 --> 01:19:24,622
Well, perhaps you'd like to tell...

1020
01:19:24,789 --> 01:19:29,210
...Mr. Weng yourself.

1021
01:19:33,714 --> 01:19:36,884
In fact, I would. I would.
Because...

1022
01:19:37,218 --> 01:19:42,223
...you know, the last time we spoke,
he was quite rude to me.

1023
01:19:42,556 --> 01:19:46,060
Well, in that case,
you'll find him somewhere...

1024
01:19:46,394 --> 01:19:50,231
...between the cashier's cage
and the high-stakes Pai Gow room.

1025
01:19:51,565 --> 01:19:56,487
He was about to eat,
when the mood to play suddenly hit him.

1026
01:19:57,405 --> 01:20:00,324
It just hit him, just like that?

1027
01:20:01,409 --> 01:20:03,911
I might've said something
to encourage him.

1028
01:20:06,247 --> 01:20:08,499
Why would you do that?

1029
01:20:09,083 --> 01:20:11,836
When you work for a powerful man...

1030
01:20:12,420 --> 01:20:16,841
...sometimes the collar
can get a little tight.

1031
01:20:22,096 --> 01:20:23,806
Excuse me.

1032
01:20:34,942 --> 01:20:36,610
- Is it on?
- Yeah.

1033
01:20:39,113 --> 01:20:41,615
- Thanks, homes.
- You're welcome.

1034
01:20:42,867 --> 01:20:45,036
Nestor says hang tough.

1035
01:20:54,545 --> 01:20:59,091
Mr. Bank, I just wanna thank you
for throwing me out of your hotel.

1036
01:21:00,843 --> 01:21:04,055
- And who are you?
- Nobody.

1037
01:21:12,063 --> 01:21:13,689
All right, fellas.

1038
01:21:17,234 --> 01:21:19,945
You're such an idiot.

1039
01:21:20,988 --> 01:21:22,156
Careful.

1040
01:21:22,531 --> 01:21:26,243
He used to gamble too.
I'm not kidding you. Right here.

1041
01:21:43,427 --> 01:21:46,931
We're gonna need you standing by
in a support capacity.

1042
01:21:51,102 --> 01:21:53,270
<i>Bad news just walked in.</i>

1043
01:21:53,604 --> 01:21:55,356
All right, the Bureau's in the house.

1044
01:21:55,523 --> 01:21:58,150
If they move towards blackjack,
somebody tip Livingston.

1045
01:21:58,317 --> 01:22:02,238
Let me welcome you to The Bank
with our finest Kubota <i>sake</i>.

1046
01:22:02,780 --> 01:22:07,076
And good to have you back, Denny.
Got some Grey Goose on ice for you.

1047
01:22:07,451 --> 01:22:09,328
Enjoy.

1048
01:22:24,468 --> 01:22:28,139
Livingston Dell?
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

1049
01:22:28,431 --> 01:22:32,518
We've got all the exits covered.
You got nowhere to go. Don't be stupid.

1050
01:22:39,317 --> 01:22:42,278
Hey, what is going on here?

1051
01:22:42,486 --> 01:22:43,904
You've been breached.

1052
01:22:44,071 --> 01:22:47,283
We've had this man under surveillance.
He rigs machines.

1053
01:22:47,825 --> 01:22:49,243
He rigs them?

1054
01:22:49,410 --> 01:22:53,039
We've been in contact with his company.
His background information was bogus.

1055
01:22:55,416 --> 01:22:57,501
How many machines
has he gotten his hands on?

1056
01:22:57,668 --> 01:22:59,086
I'm not sure.

1057
01:23:00,004 --> 01:23:02,465
- Well, let's change them out.
- We won't have enough.

1058
01:23:02,673 --> 01:23:04,884
The company's sending over
new machines.

1059
01:23:05,051 --> 01:23:07,178
If he rigs machines,
he's working with players.

1060
01:23:07,470 --> 01:23:10,556
We know he has confederates.
We just don't know who they are.

1061
01:23:10,723 --> 01:23:14,185
If you see anything that looks unusual,
you contact us.

1062
01:23:14,477 --> 01:23:18,022
You bet. You think this is over?
This isn't over.

1063
01:23:18,356 --> 01:23:22,193
I'm pressing charges.
State and federal charges. Got it?

1064
01:23:22,735 --> 01:23:24,862
Now, get him off my floor. Come on.

1065
01:23:29,825 --> 01:23:32,328
His fingerprints were all over
that shuffle machine.

1066
01:23:32,536 --> 01:23:35,873
I need a name
and all known criminal associates.

1067
01:23:36,874 --> 01:23:39,335
Bank's gonna run the prints
off the shuffle machine.

1068
01:23:39,543 --> 01:23:40,878
<i>Damn, he's good.</i>

1069
01:23:41,170 --> 01:23:43,297
<i>He'll get Livingston's ID</i>
<i>and known associates.</i>

1070
01:23:43,881 --> 01:23:45,216
<i>That's us.</i>

1071
01:23:45,549 --> 01:23:47,510
<i>What do we have in place for this?</i>

1072
01:23:47,885 --> 01:23:51,514
<i>Nothing. They'll scoop us all up and</i>
<i>Bank'll have the best night of his life.</i>

1073
01:23:51,681 --> 01:23:52,723
<i>It can't get to Bank.</i>

1074
01:23:56,060 --> 01:24:00,648
I know what to do. We'll set up a
cartwheel. Back of the house, 15 minutes.

1075
01:24:01,232 --> 01:24:02,858
<i>Who's gonna hack this?</i>

1076
01:24:03,192 --> 01:24:05,861
The ideal person's in the back of a car
in handcuffs.

1077
01:24:06,070 --> 01:24:08,906
<i>- I can handle it.</i>
<i>- Is anyone else available?</i>

1078
01:24:09,198 --> 01:24:11,867
<i>- This is Virgil. I'll give it a shot.</i>
<i>- I can handle it.</i>

1079
01:24:12,076 --> 01:24:14,537
<i>- Virgil it is.</i>
<i>- Get it done, Virg.</i>

1080
01:24:39,437 --> 01:24:41,897
Switch these out first,
then do the main floor.

1081
01:24:42,106 --> 01:24:44,025
Absolutely.

1082
01:24:46,569 --> 01:24:50,114
All right, time for the starter's gun.
Rusty, what's your 20?

1083
01:24:53,242 --> 01:24:56,871
Anybody got eyes on Rusty?
My guys are getting roughed up...

1084
01:24:57,038 --> 01:24:59,582
...and they're gonna walk.
This is a two-man play.

1085
01:24:59,749 --> 01:25:03,294
Back in range.
Just had to make a last-minute pickup.

1086
01:25:04,420 --> 01:25:05,630
Hi, boys.

1087
01:25:05,796 --> 01:25:07,131
<i>- There he is.</i>
<i>- Hey, Reuben!</i>

1088
01:25:07,298 --> 01:25:09,383
<i>- Reuben, welcome back.</i>
<i>- We missed you, buddy.</i>

1089
01:25:09,550 --> 01:25:11,052
<i>Reuben, welcome back.</i>

1090
01:25:14,138 --> 01:25:18,142
Let's raise the minimum.
I'd like to play all the seats.

1091
01:25:42,166 --> 01:25:45,503
- Really? Pineapple?
- Yeah.

1092
01:25:46,337 --> 01:25:50,633
Wait, wait. No, no.
Not here. I could lose my job.

1093
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:53,678
Doesn't the forbidden make it seem
so much more pleasurable?

1094
01:25:53,970 --> 01:25:58,975
No, no. No, Abby. I can't be free
with myself in Mr. Weng's villa.

1095
01:25:59,350 --> 01:26:02,186
- Is there another room?
- No, we're overbooked by 40 percent.

1096
01:26:02,353 --> 01:26:04,981
Somewhere. Somewhere we can go
where we can be alone.

1097
01:26:05,690 --> 01:26:10,945
- Please, Abby, take me.
- Okay. Come with me.

1098
01:26:17,410 --> 01:26:19,036
Cue the slots.

1099
01:26:32,550 --> 01:26:36,345
This is why we have soft openings,
so things like this don't happen.

1100
01:26:36,512 --> 01:26:38,681
- Get them fixed.
- Yes, sir.

1101
01:27:01,954 --> 01:27:03,247
Stunning.

1102
01:27:03,539 --> 01:27:07,043
- What is, me or the diamonds?
- Both.

1103
01:27:07,251 --> 01:27:11,380
You know, Lenny, I think you're
the most honest man in this town.

1104
01:27:13,215 --> 01:27:18,304
And I don't think we're gonna need
the security cameras for this next part.

1105
01:27:18,471 --> 01:27:22,266
<i>Well, not unless you wanna</i>
<i>watch the playback.</i>

1106
01:27:25,603 --> 01:27:28,439
I thought we agreed
to turn off our phones.

1107
01:27:28,731 --> 01:27:29,940
I know, but that's Bank.

1108
01:27:30,107 --> 01:27:32,276
He's the only one
that has that number and...

1109
01:27:38,783 --> 01:27:41,619
I could make you give that back
to me now.

1110
01:27:41,786 --> 01:27:43,245
You could try.

1111
01:27:45,456 --> 01:27:50,753
- Do you have any wine back there?
- I got everything you need back there.

1112
01:27:56,133 --> 01:27:57,969
Château d'Yquem?

1113
01:27:58,970 --> 01:28:01,722
As long as it's not '73.

1114
01:28:29,166 --> 01:28:30,960
Send that to Bank's office.

1115
01:28:55,318 --> 01:28:57,361
- Yeah.
<i>- Cue the cartwheel.</i>

1116
01:28:57,528 --> 01:28:58,863
You got it.

1117
01:28:59,030 --> 01:29:01,324
I was so happy when I saw her
on the magazine.

1118
01:29:01,532 --> 01:29:05,202
She's actually one person I really,
you know, want to do awesome.

1119
01:29:05,494 --> 01:29:08,581
You know, want her to actually
get somewhere.

1120
01:29:09,332 --> 01:29:11,751
Hello. Oh, hey, Saul.

1121
01:29:11,917 --> 01:29:14,545
- Came out here originally
for hotel management.

1122
01:29:14,837 --> 01:29:16,172
For school.

1123
01:29:16,714 --> 01:29:19,425
But, like...

1124
01:29:19,884 --> 01:29:21,594
...I don't know.

1125
01:29:25,806 --> 01:29:31,020
- Mr. Roads told us to wait inside.
- We'll be interviewing him.

1126
01:29:35,107 --> 01:29:36,609
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1127
01:30:04,095 --> 01:30:07,932
- I'm so sorry, sir. I tried to stop him.
- Not your fault, sweetheart.

1128
01:30:08,099 --> 01:30:11,435
You can't stop a man who's jumped
36 Greyhounds end-to-end.

1129
01:30:11,602 --> 01:30:15,272
It's all right, Lucille.
I'll speak with him. Yes?

1130
01:30:17,108 --> 01:30:20,778
Mr. Bank, do you know
what Chuck Berry said...

1131
01:30:20,945 --> 01:30:23,489
...every night before counting,
"One, two, three, four"?

1132
01:30:25,283 --> 01:30:28,494
- What did he say?
- "Pay me my money!"

1133
01:30:28,661 --> 01:30:31,497
- I'm sure my people will be...
- "In cash."

1134
01:30:31,664 --> 01:30:33,457
Cash?

1135
01:30:33,624 --> 01:30:35,626
You've already been wired the money!

1136
01:30:35,960 --> 01:30:38,963
Mr. Bank, this is... This is...

1137
01:30:39,297 --> 01:30:41,757
This is a Fender Roads moment!

1138
01:30:42,258 --> 01:30:45,970
- You in yet?
- I hate that question.

1139
01:30:55,313 --> 01:30:58,691
Mr. Bank, Mr. Bank, listen.
With all due respect, sir...

1140
01:30:58,858 --> 01:31:01,319
...you got a job tomorrow,
running this place.

1141
01:31:01,485 --> 01:31:04,989
- You go to work every day.
- Oh, yawn. I make one phone call...

1142
01:31:05,156 --> 01:31:09,910
...I get Shaun White, Travis Pastrana, five
of their buddies here before midnight...

1143
01:31:10,077 --> 01:31:13,164
...doing heel-clickers and lazy-boys
off the back of the building.

1144
01:31:13,497 --> 01:31:18,502
Yes, if your audience wants to see a
bunch of long-hairs riding rice rockets.

1145
01:31:18,836 --> 01:31:23,633
But I'm talking about heavy bikes, sir.
This is heavy bike! Fender Roads is a...

1146
01:31:24,342 --> 01:31:27,261
I'm a goddamn American icon!

1147
01:31:30,681 --> 01:31:33,017
Don't change it that much.
Keep the structure.

1148
01:31:33,309 --> 01:31:35,936
I'm trying to make you taller.
Don't you wanna be taller?

1149
01:31:36,103 --> 01:31:40,149
- You're a midget in 34 states.
- An animal in the other 34.

1150
01:31:41,692 --> 01:31:43,361
Twenty-four. Twenty-two.

1151
01:31:43,527 --> 01:31:47,531
This is a night people will talk about
as long as there's a Las Vegas.

1152
01:31:47,865 --> 01:31:52,870
And when they're talking about it, they'll
either be talking about you or they won't.

1153
01:31:53,704 --> 01:31:56,248
Now, that's your choice.

1154
01:31:58,042 --> 01:32:00,711
Mr. Bank, can I just say one more thing?

1155
01:32:07,051 --> 01:32:09,887
- Are you gonna jump?
- Jumping, baby!

1156
01:32:10,388 --> 01:32:13,975
Bank here. Yeah, I'm looking.

1157
01:32:18,562 --> 01:32:20,356
All right, Rusty's up.

1158
01:32:20,523 --> 01:32:22,900
I gotta say, I'm impressed.
You did a very nice job.

1159
01:32:23,067 --> 01:32:25,903
I know I did. That's why they
asked me to do it and not you.

1160
01:32:27,029 --> 01:32:30,408
Wow, see, that is me offering you
an olive basket...

1161
01:32:30,574 --> 01:32:33,035
...and that is you spitting in my face.

1162
01:32:33,244 --> 01:32:34,578
Was that your face?

1163
01:32:35,413 --> 01:32:37,039
Okay, where's Eugene's trap door?

1164
01:32:37,248 --> 01:32:39,542
<i>Under the dragon,</i>
<i>first machine on the left.</i>

1165
01:32:39,709 --> 01:32:41,002
Got it. What's the sequence?

1166
01:32:41,168 --> 01:32:43,045
<i>Coin, three count. Coin, six count.</i>

1167
01:32:43,254 --> 01:32:46,007
<i>Three coins, five count.</i>
<i>Two coins, half count.</i>

1168
01:32:46,173 --> 01:32:48,092
Could you make it
any more complicated?

1169
01:32:48,259 --> 01:32:50,886
<i>That's just the first sequence.</i>
<i>Then there's two more.</i>

1170
01:32:51,053 --> 01:32:52,680
Right.

1171
01:33:59,163 --> 01:34:00,456
I think...

1172
01:34:00,831 --> 01:34:03,000
...I think I may have got all five.

1173
01:34:03,334 --> 01:34:06,003
I did. I got all five. I got all five.
Oh, my God.

1174
01:34:06,337 --> 01:34:08,589
Oh, my God. I'm the winner!

1175
01:34:12,343 --> 01:34:14,345
Oh, my God!

1176
01:34:27,358 --> 01:34:30,152
Progressive slots win on opening night?

1177
01:34:35,366 --> 01:34:38,703
Genuine shock. Genuine surprise.
Pupil dilation.

1178
01:34:39,036 --> 01:34:41,038
Elevated heartbeat.

1179
01:34:41,706 --> 01:34:43,124
It's legitimate.

1180
01:34:53,718 --> 01:34:56,554
- New dice coming in.
- New dice.

1181
01:34:59,181 --> 01:35:00,850
New dice coming in.

1182
01:35:19,744 --> 01:35:21,537
New ball coming in.

1183
01:36:18,135 --> 01:36:21,764
- What was that?
- You felt it too?

1184
01:36:26,477 --> 01:36:30,481
You place your own bet right there.
That's what you do there.

1185
01:36:30,815 --> 01:36:32,650
Let me tell you something.

1186
01:36:34,318 --> 01:36:36,821
You are a winner.

1187
01:36:38,990 --> 01:36:40,658
Greco's still up.

1188
01:36:41,659 --> 01:36:43,244
That's it for Plan A.

1189
01:36:43,411 --> 01:36:45,663
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
place your bets.

1190
01:36:45,830 --> 01:36:47,164
There can only be one winner!

1191
01:36:56,340 --> 01:37:00,177
Everything all right? Are we okay?
Did that tremor throw off the system?

1192
01:37:00,469 --> 01:37:02,305
No, sir.
It would take more than that...

1193
01:37:02,471 --> 01:37:04,223
- Sir?
- Yeah.

1194
01:37:04,390 --> 01:37:08,019
I have a pit boss asking for an approval.
He can't reach Ms. Sponder.

1195
01:37:08,352 --> 01:37:11,647
- What's the action?
- Ten million. Roulette.

1196
01:37:15,192 --> 01:37:16,944
- It's good.
- Book it.

1197
01:37:19,697 --> 01:37:22,575
All right, the gentleman's down
to a three-number combination.

1198
01:37:22,742 --> 01:37:25,202
Eleven, 12 and 13.

1199
01:37:31,375 --> 01:37:33,794
You get reception in here?
That's impossible.

1200
01:37:33,961 --> 01:37:35,588
Not with this phone.

1201
01:37:36,380 --> 01:37:39,425
Yeah, sorry. Hello? Bank here.

1202
01:37:39,592 --> 01:37:41,677
We're getting interference on server one.

1203
01:37:41,886 --> 01:37:44,430
- What kind?
- I don't know.

1204
01:37:44,597 --> 01:37:46,724
- Hello?
- Server one is going down.

1205
01:37:46,891 --> 01:37:48,267
<i>- Oh, no.</i>
<i>- Server two...</i>

1206
01:37:48,434 --> 01:37:51,771
Something's in here. That's the
explanation, some kind of magnetron.

1207
01:37:51,937 --> 01:37:53,564
Server three's starting to wobble.

1208
01:37:53,731 --> 01:37:56,067
A magnetron? Who's got a magnetron?

1209
01:37:56,567 --> 01:37:58,986
- Four is down!
- And five. They're all going.

1210
01:37:59,153 --> 01:38:02,281
<i>Everyone in this room!</i>
<i>Empty your pockets! Now!</i>

1211
01:38:02,448 --> 01:38:04,575
What's "all going"?
What does that mean?

1212
01:38:05,576 --> 01:38:07,912
Oh, no. What the hell is this?

1213
01:38:08,162 --> 01:38:11,415
Security measures.
When the system senses a threat...

1214
01:38:11,582 --> 01:38:13,125
<i>... it shuts down and reboots.</i>

1215
01:38:17,755 --> 01:38:19,423
For how long?

1216
01:38:19,590 --> 01:38:21,926
<i>Three minutes and twenty seconds.</i>

1217
01:38:34,438 --> 01:38:35,898
Snake eyes. All of it.

1218
01:38:43,531 --> 01:38:45,449
Oh, that son of a bitch.

1219
01:38:52,415 --> 01:38:54,709
We can't take any more bets
until we're back up.

1220
01:38:54,959 --> 01:38:56,168
The system's in lockdown.

1221
01:38:56,335 --> 01:38:59,964
All calls in and out of this room
are secure, but it's the system...

1222
01:39:00,131 --> 01:39:03,718
...that secures them.
Again, sir, it's in lockdown.

1223
01:39:06,971 --> 01:39:09,307
- We're rebooting!
- Coming back up.

1224
01:39:09,557 --> 01:39:11,809
Three minutes and counting!

1225
01:39:18,774 --> 01:39:19,984
Two craps!

1226
01:41:29,697 --> 01:41:31,490
Come on, 11!

1227
01:41:33,618 --> 01:41:35,494
Give me the dice.

1228
01:41:40,374 --> 01:41:42,376
Hit them harder.

1229
01:41:57,224 --> 01:42:00,728
Boys, I think our lucky streak's
just ended.

1230
01:42:01,937 --> 01:42:03,147
Better cash them in, boys!

1231
01:42:26,754 --> 01:42:28,089
Yes.

1232
01:42:33,302 --> 01:42:35,221
All right, guys, shut her down.

1233
01:42:35,388 --> 01:42:36,889
Shut her down!

1234
01:42:37,056 --> 01:42:40,434
- She is shut down.
<i>- No time for jokes, fellas.</i>

1235
01:42:40,601 --> 01:42:45,022
- Do I sound like I'm laughing, sweetheart?
- You think Nagel was...?

1236
01:42:45,982 --> 01:42:47,191
Nah.

1237
01:43:09,880 --> 01:43:13,217
Down the street. Safely, safely.
Right this way, everybody.

1238
01:43:13,551 --> 01:43:15,553
Down the street, safely, please.

1239
01:43:16,470 --> 01:43:19,557
Safely, right this way.
Right this way, everybody.

1240
01:43:19,890 --> 01:43:22,727
George, what are you doing?
The earthquake's over!

1241
01:43:22,893 --> 01:43:25,062
They gotta get back!
We gotta get them back in!

1242
01:43:25,229 --> 01:43:27,982
Sir, it's the evacuation plan. I...

1243
01:43:32,570 --> 01:43:36,407
It's all over now. We can get back to us.

1244
01:43:38,075 --> 01:43:40,745
- Feel my heart. Lenny, feel it.
- No... What...?

1245
01:43:41,912 --> 01:43:45,750
Oh, no. That's gonna stain.
Why don't we take these off?

1246
01:43:45,916 --> 01:43:48,461
- It's white wine.
- Off. Get them off.

1247
01:43:48,628 --> 01:43:52,256
- It's white wine! Oh, boy. Okay.
- Hold it right there!

1248
01:43:52,757 --> 01:43:54,425
- FBI.
- Oh, dear God.

1249
01:43:56,594 --> 01:43:57,928
Robert?

1250
01:43:58,596 --> 01:44:01,641
This man, Lenny Pepperidge,
a.k.a. Lenny the Pep...

1251
01:44:01,807 --> 01:44:05,561
...a.k.a. Sheldon Wills,
a.k.a. Little Timmy Hartwell...

1252
01:44:05,728 --> 01:44:08,939
...is a confidence man.
- Okay, that's not the whole...

1253
01:44:09,231 --> 01:44:10,733
- Help her up.
- Oh, my God.

1254
01:44:10,942 --> 01:44:15,112
He infiltrates high-end establishments
through legitimate business contacts.

1255
01:44:15,404 --> 01:44:19,241
He was gonna drug you and replace
the real diamonds with these.

1256
01:44:19,951 --> 01:44:23,454
- My God. Oh, my God.
- And that's not all.

1257
01:44:24,330 --> 01:44:26,123
No...!

1258
01:44:28,918 --> 01:44:30,127
Oh, my God.

1259
01:44:30,294 --> 01:44:32,838
Oh, Abby. Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1260
01:44:33,381 --> 01:44:36,300
- No, I really like you.
- Shut up.

1261
01:44:37,468 --> 01:44:40,096
- Oh, I am so finished.
- Don't let it bother you.

1262
01:44:40,304 --> 01:44:44,433
- I'm finished.
- He's a professional at allaying suspicion.

1263
01:44:44,642 --> 01:44:47,645
And seducing women of a certain age.

1264
01:44:50,982 --> 01:44:53,609
You know, if Bank hears about this,
I am...

1265
01:44:53,818 --> 01:44:57,154
I'll be delicate in my report.
Get her statement.

1266
01:44:57,488 --> 01:44:59,490
Thank you, Agent Caldwell.

1267
01:45:01,117 --> 01:45:02,660
I'll need your full name.

1268
01:45:16,299 --> 01:45:17,842
Thank you.

1269
01:45:19,051 --> 01:45:21,137
I'm glad your mother
didn't have to see that.

1270
01:45:21,304 --> 01:45:24,098
You just don't wanna admit
the Brody played.

1271
01:45:24,807 --> 01:45:26,726
It's a little early for a victory lap.

1272
01:45:26,892 --> 01:45:29,353
<i>I hate to break this up,</i>
<i>but did you make the switch?</i>

1273
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:32,732
<i>Yeah. Everything went according to plan.</i>
<i>We're heading to the roof.</i>

1274
01:45:32,898 --> 01:45:35,985
- Did you hear that?
- I'm ready.

1275
01:45:39,822 --> 01:45:42,491
You know, it's not that I'm just
so desperate to celebrate.

1276
01:45:42,700 --> 01:45:47,079
I need you to acknowledge that it wasn't
a prop for prop's sake. The nose played.

1277
01:45:47,246 --> 01:45:49,665
And, in a way, it was kind of
perversely dignified.

1278
01:45:49,874 --> 01:45:53,210
Look, let's just finish the job.

1279
01:45:54,712 --> 01:45:56,547
There he is.

1280
01:46:18,653 --> 01:46:21,489
Oh, what the hell? What the hell?

1281
01:46:21,906 --> 01:46:23,240
Come on.

1282
01:46:23,908 --> 01:46:25,952
Now, give me the diamonds.

1283
01:46:26,702 --> 01:46:29,914
- Come on.
- Give him the diamonds.

1284
01:46:49,433 --> 01:46:51,060
A gun?

1285
01:47:22,174 --> 01:47:23,592
Come on, let's go!

1286
01:47:41,986 --> 01:47:46,324
Tough night.
Half a billion running out the door.

1287
01:47:47,950 --> 01:47:50,328
Gonna roll over and die?

1288
01:47:53,664 --> 01:47:55,583
You think you hit me.

1289
01:47:59,879 --> 01:48:03,341
You don't even know
where my soft targets are.

1290
01:48:04,967 --> 01:48:08,679
I'm still a two handicap on a golf course,
you know.

1291
01:48:08,888 --> 01:48:13,184
I got the hottest new hotel on The Strip.

1292
01:48:13,726 --> 01:48:16,771
And I'm a shoo-in
for the Five Diamond Award...

1293
01:48:17,063 --> 01:48:18,314
...yet again.

1294
01:48:18,481 --> 01:48:20,775
- You sure about that?
- Sure? I got that baby...

1295
01:48:20,942 --> 01:48:22,401
All sewn up.

1296
01:48:44,131 --> 01:48:47,385
This town might've changed,
but not me.

1297
01:48:48,719 --> 01:48:50,763
I'm gonna let you down.

1298
01:48:52,682 --> 01:48:57,895
I know people highly invested
in my survival.

1299
01:48:58,062 --> 01:49:01,983
And they are people who really know
how to hurt.

1300
01:49:02,149 --> 01:49:06,570
In ways you can't even imagine.

1301
01:49:10,199 --> 01:49:14,495
Well, first, I know all the guys
that you'd hire to come after me.

1302
01:49:14,662 --> 01:49:16,289
They like me better than you.

1303
01:49:25,589 --> 01:49:28,676
Second, you're not gonna
go to the cops because...

1304
01:49:28,843 --> 01:49:30,970
Let's face it.
You're not gonna go to the cops.

1305
01:49:36,767 --> 01:49:41,105
Third, you shook Sinatra's hand.

1306
01:49:42,189 --> 01:49:44,734
You should know better, Willy.

1307
01:50:09,342 --> 01:50:11,469
My diamonds.

1308
01:50:32,406 --> 01:50:34,951
No, no, no.

1309
01:51:36,804 --> 01:51:38,639
What's this?

1310
01:51:38,931 --> 01:51:42,727
That's just the deed to 4.6 acres
of prime real estate...

1311
01:51:42,893 --> 01:51:45,438
...at the north end of The Strip.

1312
01:51:46,564 --> 01:51:50,443
The moment you become embarrassed
of who you are, you lose yourself.

1313
01:51:50,610 --> 01:51:53,529
I changed my house,
the way I dressed, what I ate...

1314
01:51:53,696 --> 01:51:56,407
...for what? For nothing.

1315
01:51:57,283 --> 01:51:59,201
There he is.

1316
01:52:00,661 --> 01:52:02,913
Thanks for those letters.

1317
01:52:04,540 --> 01:52:06,751
They brought me back.

1318
01:52:12,298 --> 01:52:14,258
You're more than welcome.

1319
01:52:30,858 --> 01:52:32,777
- Hello.
- Hi.

1320
01:52:32,944 --> 01:52:35,321
Looking for Terry. It's Danny Ocean.

1321
01:52:43,955 --> 01:52:46,082
- Danny.
- Terry.

1322
01:52:46,415 --> 01:52:48,209
You called an audible last night.

1323
01:52:48,376 --> 01:52:50,336
That's what I do
when I see a blitz coming.

1324
01:52:50,503 --> 01:52:52,964
- A blitz?
- Toulour happened to be on the roof...

1325
01:52:53,130 --> 01:52:56,884
...at the exact moment that we were
coming out with those diamonds.

1326
01:52:57,051 --> 01:53:00,346
- How'd you know I'd go for them?
- Because you're you and I'm me.

1327
01:53:00,805 --> 01:53:05,017
<i>We were watching Toulour</i>
<i>while you had him watching us.</i>

1328
01:53:08,980 --> 01:53:12,817
This is your end,
which you donated to charity.

1329
01:53:14,694 --> 01:53:16,654
- Charity?
- Camp To Belong.

1330
01:53:16,821 --> 01:53:20,116
The kids are grateful. They're gonna
have you up to visit next month.

1331
01:53:28,082 --> 01:53:30,501
Now, you know that wasn't our deal.

1332
01:53:31,502 --> 01:53:34,922
If you feel that strongly about it,
we'll yank the kids out of the camp...

1333
01:53:35,089 --> 01:53:39,510
...and send them back
to their foster homes, all 200 of them.

1334
01:53:41,804 --> 01:53:46,058
- You think this is funny?
- Well, Terry, it sure as shit ain't sad.

1335
01:53:53,858 --> 01:53:55,818
<i>Why these children?</i>

1336
01:53:56,444 --> 01:54:00,197
<i>Well, I was just very moved by</i>
<i>the kind of work they're doing there.</i>

1337
01:54:00,364 --> 01:54:01,866
<i>And you gotta start somewhere.</i>

1338
01:54:02,033 --> 01:54:04,869
<i>And luckily, you know,</i>
<i>the casino business is doing well...</i>

1339
01:54:05,036 --> 01:54:07,163
<i>... and I hope there's</i>
<i>more millions to come...</i>

1340
01:54:07,330 --> 01:54:09,707
<i>... that we can spread around</i>
<i>to other organizations.</i>

1341
01:54:09,874 --> 01:54:13,836
<i>But like I said,</i>
<i>I was very moved by that place.</i>

1342
01:54:14,003 --> 01:54:17,381
<i>All you gotta do is look</i>
<i>inside a child's eyes and...</i>

1343
01:54:17,548 --> 01:54:22,261
<i>And that's all it needs...</i>
<i>That's all the motivation that one needs.</i>

1344
01:54:22,428 --> 01:54:24,972
<i>- Well, thank you for being an angel for us.</i>
<i>- Thank you.</i>

1345
01:54:25,139 --> 01:54:29,310
<i>- Like I said, I'm just following her lead.</i>
<i>- Thank you. Terry Benedict. We'll be back.</i>

1346
01:54:37,652 --> 01:54:41,989
Well, I gotta jump. My dad's working
a frame. He's got a part for me in it.

1347
01:54:45,910 --> 01:54:48,287
- Congratulations.
- Nice going.

1348
01:54:56,420 --> 01:54:58,339
See you when I see you.

1349
01:55:09,433 --> 01:55:11,978
So I guess it's just
the Susan B. Anthony, then, again.

1350
01:55:12,144 --> 01:55:13,396
I never get tired of it.

1351
01:55:13,562 --> 01:55:16,232
- Can't get too close. He's probably still...
- Right.

1352
01:55:18,192 --> 01:55:19,652
So...

1353
01:55:21,320 --> 01:55:23,489
See you when I see you.

1354
01:55:25,116 --> 01:55:29,245
Hey, next time try keeping
the weight off in between.

1355
01:55:32,873 --> 01:55:35,793
You ought to settle down,
have a couple of kids.

1356
01:55:44,343 --> 01:55:48,723
- We'll call standbys in a few minutes.
- Please.

1357
01:55:48,889 --> 01:55:51,017
Please, I gotta get out of here.

1358
01:55:51,183 --> 01:55:54,228
Maybe you'll get lucky this time.

1359
01:56:10,453 --> 01:56:13,205
Hey, you dropped these.

1360
01:56:13,372 --> 01:56:15,041
Go ahead. I got a plane to catch.

1361
01:56:15,207 --> 01:56:18,336
Actually, try this one.
It's been paying out.

1362
01:56:26,135 --> 01:56:28,554
I won! Look at this!

1363
01:56:28,721 --> 01:56:32,308
I won $ 11 million. Can you believe it?

1364
01:56:32,475 --> 01:56:36,020
Look at that! I won $ 11 million.
Did you see that?

1365
01:56:36,187 --> 01:56:37,355
I can't believe it!
