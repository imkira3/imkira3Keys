Explain yourself.

00:02:44,845 --> 00:02:47,979
We were sent to find the man
dressed as a bat.

32
00:02:47,981 --> 00:02:51,749
Our master has ordered us
to kill him on sight.

None of this makes any sense.

Everything's offline.

39
00:04:33,887 --> 00:04:36,055
But from the look of it,
this is ancient Japan.

40
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:41,060
Which doesn't explain
what's going on up there.

Oh, but you
have to admit,

51
00:05:17,163 --> 00:05:20,565
we really had you
going there, didn't we?

52
00:05:20,567 --> 00:05:24,601
That's enough. What are you

But you can call me...

58
00:05:35,748 --> 00:05:38,883
Lord Joker.

59
00:05:38,885 --> 00:05:41,185
Oh, I never really
wanted to be a Lord.

60
00:05:41,187 --> 00:05:43,488
It wasn't what you would
call an aspiration.

61
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:45,423
But when life throws
you time travels,

62
00:05:45,425 --> 00:05:47,657
sometimes you gotta make travelade.

Mwah. It's even better

Mmm.

Don't you know how bad razor-edged
fighting fans are for the environment?

79
00:06:45,618 --> 00:06:47,452
You're the one who
keeps throwing them.

80
00:06:47,454 --> 00:06:50,057

How is that

And the criminals?

148
00:10:49,695 --> 00:10:51,996
Like the Joker,
they've taken over.

149
00:10:51,998 --> 00:10:54,598
They've deceived
all the <i>Sengoku Daimyos</i>

That's right.
