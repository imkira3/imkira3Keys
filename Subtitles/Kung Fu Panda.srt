00:00:37,705 --> 00:00:41,125
Legend tells of a legendary warrior

3
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:44,378
whose kung fu skills
were the stuff of legend.

4
00:00:45,504 --> 00:00:50,092
He traveled the land
in search of worthy foes.

5
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:05,691
I see you like to chew.
Maybe you should chew on my fist!

6
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:09,278
The warrior said nothing,
for his mouth was full.

7
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:12,531
Then he swallowed. And then he spoke.

8
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:14,908
Enough talk. Let's fight!

9
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:16,410
Shashabooey!

10
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:21,206
He was so deadly in fact,

11
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:24,960
that his enemies would go blind from
overexposure to pure awesomeness.

12
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:27,254
- My eyes!
- He's too awesome!

13
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:30,090
- And attractive.
- How can we repay you?

14
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,302
There is no charge for awesomeness.

15
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:36,013
Or attractiveness.

16
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,347
Kablooey!

17
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:40,142
It mattered not how many foes he faced.

18
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:43,103
They were no match for his bodacity!

19
00:01:55,616 --> 00:02:00,287
Never before had a panda
been so feared! And so loved.

20
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:03,791
Even the most heroic heroes in China,

21
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:06,126
the Furious Five,

22
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:09,213
bowed in respect to this great master.

23
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:11,131
We should hang out.

24
00:02:11,215 --> 00:02:12,341
Agreed.

25
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:17,304
But hanging out would have to wait.

26
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:21,809
Because when you're facing
the 10,000 demons of Demon Mountain,

27
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:24,603
there's only one thing
that matters and that's...

28
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,271
Po! Get up!

29
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:27,898
You'll be late forwork!

30
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:29,650
What?

31
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:38,075
Po! Get up!

32
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:57,302
Po! What are you doing up there?

33
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:58,637
Nothing.

34
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:05,978
Monkey! Mantis! Crane! Viper! Tigress!

35
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:15,696
Po! Let's go! You're late forwork.

36
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:17,155
Coming!

37
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:28,709
Sorry, Dad.

38
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:31,587
Sorry doesn't make the noodles.

39
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,047
What were you doing up there?
All that noise.

40
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:36,592
Nothing. I just had a crazy dream.

41
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:37,885
About what?

42
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:39,553
What were you dreaming about?

43
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,179
What was I...

44
00:03:42,014 --> 00:03:44,016
I was dreaming about

45
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,060
noodles.

46
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,189
Noodles? You were really
dreaming about noodles?

47
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:53,817
Yeah. What else
would I be dreaming about?

48
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:56,361
Careful! That soup is sharp.

49
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:57,905
Oh, happy day!

50
00:03:57,988 --> 00:04:01,867
My son, finally having the noodle dream!

51
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:07,331
You don't know how long I've been
waiting for this moment.

52
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:09,249
This is a sign, Po.

53
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,126
A sign ofwhat?

54
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:15,839
You are almost ready to be entrusted
with the secret ingredient

55
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:18,175
of my Secret Ingredient Soup.

56
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:23,388
Then you will fulfill your destiny
and take over the restaurant!

57
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:26,934
As I took it over from my father,
who took it over from his father

58
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:29,436
who won it from a friend
in a game of mahjong.

59
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,230
Dad, Dad, Dad, it was just a dream.

60
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:34,608
No, it was the dream.

61
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:38,236
We are noodle folk.
Broth runs through our veins.

62
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,199
But, Dad, didn't you everwant
to do something else?

63
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,117
Something besides noodles?

64
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:47,120
Actually, when I was young and crazy,

65
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:51,291
I thought about running away
and learning how to make tofu.

66
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:52,459
Why didn't you?

67
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,336
Because it was a stupid dream.

68
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:58,548
Can you imagine me making tofu?

69
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:01,009
Tofu.

70
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:04,554
No! We all have our place in this world.

71
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:07,182
Mine is here, and yours is...

72
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:08,475
I know, is here.

73
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:11,687
No, it's at tables 2, 5, 7, and 12.

74
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,855
Service with a smile.

75
00:05:43,135 --> 00:05:47,431
Well done, students,
ifyou were trying to disappoint me.

76
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:50,684
Tigress, you need more ferocity!
Monkey, greater speed.

77
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,645
Crane, height. Viper, subtlety. Mantis...

78
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:55,522
- Master Shifu.
- What?

79
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:58,066
It's Master Oogway.
He wants to see you.

80
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:12,456
Master Oogway, you summoned me?
Is something wrong?

81
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:23,216
Why must something be wrong
for me to want to see my old friend?

82
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,427
So, nothing's wrong?

83
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,138
Well, I didn't say that.

84
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:47,866
You were saying?

85
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:51,036
I have had a vision.

86
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,830
Tai Lung will return.

87
00:06:58,794 --> 00:07:01,338
That is impossible! He is in prison.

88
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:04,257
Nothing is impossible.

89
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:06,093
Zeng!

90
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:08,512
Fly to Chor Ghom Prison and tell them

91
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:11,932
to double the guards, double
theirweapons, double everything!

92
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:13,892
Tai Lung does not leave that prison!

93
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,435
Yes, Master Shifu!

94
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:22,275
One often meets his destiny
on the road he takes to avoid it.

95
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:23,401
We have to do something!

96
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:26,488
We can't let him march on the valley
and take his revenge!

97
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:27,572
He'll...

98
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:29,950
Your mind is like this water, my friend.

99
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:33,453
When it is agitated,
it becomes difficult to see.

100
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:36,623
But ifyou allow it to settle,

101
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,709
the answer becomes clear.

102
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:44,714
The Dragon Scroll.

103
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:47,134
It is time.

104
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:51,930
But who? Who is worthy to be trusted
with the secret to limitless power?

105
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:56,726
To become the Dragon Warrior?

106
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,270
I don't know.

107
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:02,065
Excuse me. Pardon me. Sorry.

108
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,025
Watch it, Po!

109
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:05,610
Sorry. Suck it up!

110
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,781
Sorry. A thousand pardons.

111
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:10,866
What?

112
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:16,204
Master Oogway's choosing
the Dragon Warrior! Today!

113
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:18,456
Everyone! Go! Get to the Jade Palace!

114
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,876
One of the Five
is gonna get the Dragon Scroll!

115
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,586
We've been waiting a thousand years
for this!

116
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,004
Take the bowl!

117
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:26,423
This is the greatest day
in kung fu history!

118
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,216
Don't worry about it. Just go!

119
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,302
Po! Where are you going?

120
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:33,513
To the Jade Palace.

121
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:35,891
You're forgetting your noodle cart.

122
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:40,520
The whole valley will be there,
and you'll sell noodles to all ofthem.

123
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:42,022
Selling noodles?

124
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:46,943
But, Dad, I was thinking, maybe I...

125
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:49,154
- Yeah?
- I was thinking maybe I...

126
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:57,537
...could also sell the bean buns.
They're about to go bad.

127
00:08:57,621 --> 00:08:59,331
That's my boy!

128
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:01,625
I told you that dream was a sign.

129
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,753
Yeah. Glad I had it.

130
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:11,343
- I'm a kung fu warrior!
- Me, too!

131
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:13,970
- There's spots at the top.
- Let's go.

132
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:51,216
Come on. Come on!

133
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,134
Almost there.

134
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:54,386
What?

135
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:57,138
No! Oh, no!

136
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:03,019
- Sorry, Po.
- We'll bring you back a souvenir.

137
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:10,986
No. I'll bring me back a souvenir.

138
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:17,575
It is an historic day.

139
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:19,411
Isn't it, Master Oogway?

140
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:24,332
Yes, and one I feared
I would not live to see.

141
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,418
Are your students ready?

142
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:28,253
Yes, Master Oogway.

143
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:31,131
Know this, old friend.

144
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:35,552
Whomever I choose will not only bring
peace to the valley

145
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,263
but also to you.

146
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:45,729
Let the tournament begin!

147
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,575
Yeah.

148
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,329
No, no, wait!

149
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:04,748
I'm coming! Wait, wait!

150
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,082
Yes!

151
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,254
Hey! Open the door!

152
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,426
Let me in!

153
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:19,054
Citizens ofthe Valley of Peace,

154
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:22,640
it is my great honor
to present to you, Tigress!

155
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:26,936
Viper! Crane! Monkey! Mantis!

156
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,605
The Furious Five!

157
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:42,577
Yeah, the Furious Five!

158
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:46,206
Warriors, prepare!

159
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:48,833
Wait. No. Oh, peeky-hole.

160
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:50,251
- Ready for battle!
- Yeah.

161
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:54,297
The Thousand Tongues of Fire.

162
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:57,717
Look at that.

163
00:11:57,801 --> 00:11:59,803
Hey! Get out ofthe way!

164
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:36,423
And finally, Master Tigress!

165
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:42,262
Believe me, citizens,
you have not seen anything yet.

166
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:43,596
I know!

167
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:48,768
Master Tigress! Face Iron Ox
and his Blades of Death.

168
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:05,702
I sense the Dragon Warrior
is among us.

169
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:13,835
Citizens ofthe Valley of Peace,

170
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:18,465
Master Oogway will now choose
the Dragon Warrior!

171
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:21,593
Oh, no! No, no, wait!

172
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:24,387
Yeah.

173
00:13:40,904 --> 00:13:41,905
Po!

174
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:43,907
What are you doing?

175
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,534
What does it look like I'm doing? Stop!

176
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:48,578
I'm going to see the Dragon Warrior!

177
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:56,002
But I don't understand.
You finally had the noodle dream!

178
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:59,923
I lied. I don't dream about noodles, Dad.

179
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:06,304
I love kung fu!

180
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:23,321
Come on, son. Let's get back to work.

181
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:27,325
Okay.

182
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,166
Come back!

183
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,192
What's going on?

184
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:03,695
Where...

185
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,615
What are you pointing...

186
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,328
Okay. Sorry.

187
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,872
I just wanted to see
who the Dragon Warriorwas.

188
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:16,874
How interesting.

189
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:20,253
Master, are you pointing at me?

190
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,338
- Him.
- Who?

191
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:26,551
- You.
- Me?

192
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:32,140
The universe has brought us
the Dragon Warrior!

193
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,766
- What?
- What?

194
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,560
- What?
- What?

195
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:48,031
Stop, wait! Who told you to...

196
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:59,042
Master Oogway, wait.

197
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:03,421
That flabby panda can't possibly be
the answer to our problem.

198
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:07,216
You were about to point at Tigress
and that thing fell in front of her!

199
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,718
That was just an accident!

200
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,554
There are no accidents.

201
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:29,447
Forgive us, Master. We have failed you.

202
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:32,825
No. Ifthe panda has not quit
by morning,

203
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:35,244
then I will have failed you.

204
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:56,265
Wait! Wait, wait, wait!
I bring a message

205
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,601
from Master Shifu.

206
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:04,399
What?

207
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:05,817
"Double the guard"?

208
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,694
"Extra precautions"?

209
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:10,113
"Your prison may not be adequate"?

210
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,661
You doubt my prison security?

211
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,579
Absolutely not.

212
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:21,791
Shifu does. I'm just the messenger.

213
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:25,503
I'll give you a message
for your Master Shifu.

214
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:29,298
Escape from Chor Ghom Prison
is impossible!

215
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:36,180
Impressive, isn't it?

216
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:40,768
It's very impressive.

217
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:43,521
One way in, one way out.

218
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:47,692
One thousand guards and one prisoner.

219
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,278
Yes, except that prisoner

220
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:52,071
is Tai Lung.

221
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:57,869
Take us down.

222
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:04,834
What are you doing?

223
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:17,638
Oh, my.

224
00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:24,979
Behold Tai Lung.

225
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:29,692
I'm just gonna wait right here.

226
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:34,071
It's nothing to worry about.
It's perfectly safe.

227
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:36,407
Crossbows! At the ready!

228
00:18:36,491 --> 00:18:38,284
Crossbows?

229
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:40,912
Hey, tough guy, did you hear?

230
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:45,458
Oogway's giving someone the Dragon
Scroll, and it's not gonna be you.

231
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,210
Don't get him mad.

232
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:52,089
What's he gonna do about it?
I've got him completely immobilized.

233
00:18:56,219 --> 00:19:00,014
Did I step on the wittle kitty's tail?

234
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,933
I'm good. I've seen enough.

235
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:04,435
I'll tell Shifu
he has nothing to worry about.

236
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:05,728
No, he doesn't.

237
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:08,022
I'll tell him that.

238
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,982
Can we please go now?

239
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:28,251
Dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior!

240
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,133
Wait a second!

241
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:45,810
I think there's been a slight mistake.
Everyone seems to think that I'm...

242
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:52,108
The Sacred Hall ofWarriors! No way!

243
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:54,485
Look at this place.

244
00:19:56,654 --> 00:20:01,117
Master Flying Rhino's armor,
with authentic battle damage!

245
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:05,037
The Sword of Heroes!

246
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:08,374
Said to be so sharp you can cut yourself
just by looking...

247
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:13,129
The Invisible Trident of Destiny!

248
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:17,967
I've only seen paintings ofthat painting.

249
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,808
No!

250
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:29,896
The Legendary Urn
ofWhispering Warriors.

251
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:33,149
Said to contain the souls
ofthe entire Tenshu army.

252
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:37,612
Hello.

253
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:40,031
Have you finished sight-seeing?

254
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:42,199
Sorry, I should have come to you first.

255
00:20:42,283 --> 00:20:44,243
My patience is wearing thin.

256
00:20:44,327 --> 00:20:47,121
Well, I mean, it's not like
you were going anywhere.

257
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:49,582
- Would you turn around?
- Sure.

258
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:50,666
How's it going?

259
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,169
How do you get 5,000... Master Shifu!

260
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,548
Someone broke that.

261
00:20:57,632 --> 00:21:00,009
But I'll fix it. Do you have some

262
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,219
glue?

263
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:06,223
A splinter.

264
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:09,268
So you're the legendary
Dragon Warrior?

265
00:21:09,352 --> 00:21:12,480
- I guess so.
- Wrong!

266
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:13,814
You are not the Dragon Warrior.

267
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:16,275
You will never be
the Dragon Warrior until

268
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:19,320
you have learned the secret
ofthe Dragon Scroll.

269
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,950
So, how does this work?

270
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:26,911
Do you have a ladder,
or a trampoline, or...

271
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:32,291
You think it's that easy?
That I'll just hand you the secret

272
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:34,251
- to limitless power?
- No, I...

273
00:21:34,335 --> 00:21:37,338
One must first master
the highest level of kung fu.

274
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:41,467
And that is clearly impossible
ifthat one is someone like you.

275
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,593
Someone like me?

276
00:21:42,677 --> 00:21:47,306
Yes, look at you!
This fat butt! Flabby arms!

277
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:49,850
Those are sensitive in the flabby parts.

278
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:52,770
And this ridiculous belly.

279
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:56,107
And utter disregard
for personal hygiene.

280
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,317
Now, wait a minute. That's uncalled for.

281
00:21:58,401 --> 00:22:00,945
Don't stand that close.
I can smell your breath.

282
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:02,947
Listen, Oogway said I was...

283
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,700
The Wuxi Finger Hold.
Not the Wuxi Finger Hold!

284
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:08,494
Oh, you know this hold?

285
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:11,247
Developed by Master Wuxi
in the Third Dynasty. Yes.

286
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,083
Then you know what happens
when I flex my pinky.

287
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:17,628
- No, no!
- You know the hardest part ofthis?

288
00:22:17,712 --> 00:22:21,549
The hardest part is cleaning up
afterwards.

289
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:23,759
Okay, okay, take it easy.

290
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:26,262
Now listen closely, panda.

291
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:29,473
Oogway may have picked you,
but when I'm through with you,

292
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:34,437
I promise you, you're going to wish
he hadn't! Are we clear?

293
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:37,732
Yeah, we're clear. We're so clear.

294
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:39,525
Good.

295
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,402
I can't wait to get started.

296
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,486
- Let's begin.
- Wait, wait, wait.

297
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,112
What?

298
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:29,116
- Now?
- Yes, now.

299
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,496
Unless the great Oogway was wrong
and you are not the Dragon Warrior.

300
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:35,122
Oh, okay, well...

301
00:23:35,206 --> 00:23:39,210
I don't know
if I can do all of those moves.

302
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:42,046
Well, ifwe don't try,
we'll never know, will we?

303
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:45,925
Yeah, it's just, maybe we can find
something more suited to my level.

304
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:47,093
What level is that?

305
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:50,596
Well, I'm not a master, but

306
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,432
let's just start at zero. Level zero.

307
00:23:53,516 --> 00:23:57,603
No. There is no such thing
as level zero.

308
00:23:57,686 --> 00:24:00,439
- Maybe I can start with that.
- That?

309
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:05,653
We use that for training children and
propping the door open when it's hot.

310
00:24:05,736 --> 00:24:07,113
But ifyou insist...

311
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:09,782
The Furious Five!

312
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,992
You're so much bigger
than your action figures.

313
00:24:12,076 --> 00:24:15,496
Except for you, Mantis.
You're about the same.

314
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:20,126
Go ahead, panda.
Show us what you can do.

315
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:25,589
Are they gonna watch, or should I wait
till they get back to work or something?

316
00:24:25,673 --> 00:24:26,757
Hit it.

317
00:24:26,841 --> 00:24:31,137
Okay, yeah. I mean, I just ate.
So I'm still digesting.

318
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:34,974
So my kung fu might not be
as good as later on.

319
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:36,225
Just hit it.

320
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:38,435
All right.

321
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:42,523
What you got? You got nothing,
'cause I got it right here.

322
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:45,526
You picking on my friends?
Get ready to feel thunder.

323
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:47,903
I'm coming at you with crazy feet.
What you gonna do about crazy feet?

324
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:50,990
Come on. I'm a blur.
You've never seen bear style.

325
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:52,825
You've only seen praying mantis.

326
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,869
Or monkey style.

327
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:57,830
Or I could come at you snickety-snake.

328
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:00,291
Would you hit it!

329
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:02,585
All right. All right.

330
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:11,427
Why don't you try again? A little harder.

331
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:14,305
How's that?

332
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:26,525
That hurts.

333
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,701
This will be easier than I thought.

334
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:38,287
I'm feeling a little nauseous!

335
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:41,040
Those are hard!

336
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,212
My tenders.

337
00:26:14,365 --> 00:26:16,075
How did I do?

338
00:26:16,158 --> 00:26:19,620
There is now a level zero.

339
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:22,414
- There's no words.
- No denying that.

340
00:26:22,498 --> 00:26:24,792
I don't understand
what Master Oogway was thinking.

341
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:27,169
The poor guy's gonna get himself killed.

342
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:29,755
He is so mighty!

343
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:34,635
The Dragon Warrior fell out ofthe sky
on a ball of fire!

344
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:37,554
When he walks,
the very ground shakes!

345
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:42,810
One would think Master Oogway would
choose someone who knew kung fu.

346
00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:44,937
Yeah, or could at least touch his toes.

347
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,398
Or even see his toes.

348
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:13,007
Okay.

349
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:23,434
Great.

350
00:27:38,115 --> 00:27:39,700
Hi. You're up.

351
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:41,160
I am now.

352
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:42,995
I was just...

353
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:45,331
Some day, huh?

354
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:49,793
That kung fu stuff is hard work, right?
Are your biceps sore?

355
00:27:50,252 --> 00:27:55,049
I've had a long
and rather disappointing day, so...

356
00:27:55,758 --> 00:27:59,094
Yeah, I should probably
get to sleep now.

357
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:01,597
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course.
- Okay, thanks.

358
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,350
It's just... Man, I'm such a big fan!

359
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:07,019
You guys were amazing
at the Battle ofWeeping River.

360
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:10,606
Outnumbered a thousand to one,
but you didn't stop. You just...

361
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:16,028
Sorry about that.

362
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:18,614
Look, you don't belong here.

363
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:23,660
I know. I know. You're right.

364
00:28:23,744 --> 00:28:25,788
I don't have... I just...

365
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:27,373
My whole life I dreamed of...

366
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:32,336
No, I meant you don't belong here.
I mean, in this room. This is my room.

367
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,756
Property of Crane.

368
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,716
Okay. Right, right.

369
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,302
So, you want to get to sleep.

370
00:28:40,386 --> 00:28:42,179
- Yeah.
- I'm keeping you up.

371
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:44,390
We got big things tomorrow.

372
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:48,644
All right. You're awesome.
Last thing I'm gonna say. Bye-bye.

373
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:53,649
What was that?

374
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,150
I didn't say anything.

375
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:57,403
Okay. All right. Good night.

376
00:28:57,486 --> 00:28:58,654
Sleep well.

377
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:03,325
That seemed a little awkward.

378
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:07,746
Master Tigress!
I didn't mean to wake you.

379
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:10,541
- You don't belong here.
- Yeah, of course.

380
00:29:10,624 --> 00:29:11,917
This is your room.

381
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,254
I mean, you don't belong
in the Jade Palace.

382
00:29:15,337 --> 00:29:17,548
You're a disgrace to kung fu,
and ifyou have

383
00:29:17,631 --> 00:29:21,260
any respect forwho we are
and what we do,

384
00:29:21,552 --> 00:29:23,720
you will be gone by morning.

385
00:29:29,351 --> 00:29:31,019
Big fan!

386
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:42,197
I see you have found the Sacred
Peach Tree of Heavenly Wisdom.

387
00:29:44,575 --> 00:29:49,288
Is that what this is? Sorry. I thought
it was just a regular peach tree.

388
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:54,293
I understand.
You eat when you are upset.

389
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:58,380
Upset? I'm not upset.
What makes you think I'm upset.

390
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:02,050
So why are you upset?

391
00:30:07,181 --> 00:30:10,684
I probably sucked more today
than anyone in the history of kung fu.

392
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:14,396
In the history of China.
In the history of sucking!

393
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,564
Probably.

394
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:19,318
And the Five! Man, you should've
seen them! They totally hate me.

395
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:20,402
Totally.

396
00:30:20,486 --> 00:30:24,573
How is Shifu ever going to turn me
into the Dragon Warrior?

397
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,577
I mean, I'm not like the Five.

398
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:32,206
I've got no claws, no wings, no venom.

399
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:35,250
Even Mantis has those thingies.

400
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:40,255
Maybe I should just quit
and go back to making noodles.

401
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:45,761
Quit, don't quit.

402
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:49,681
Noodles, don't noodles.

403
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:54,394
You are too concerned
with what was and what will be.

404
00:30:54,478 --> 00:30:56,355
There's a saying.

405
00:30:56,438 --> 00:30:59,274
Yesterday is history,

406
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:01,610
tomorrow is a mystery,

407
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:04,613
but today is a gift.

408
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:07,491
That is why it is called the present.

409
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:39,856
- Oh, no!
- What's happening?

410
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:42,442
To your battle stations! Go! Go! Go!

411
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,786
Fire crossbows!

412
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:54,204
Fire!

413
00:31:56,832 --> 00:31:57,874
Fire!

414
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:08,260
Tai Lung is free! I must warn Shifu.

415
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:10,262
You're not going anywhere!
Neither is he!

416
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:12,180
- Let go of me!
- Bring it up!

417
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:16,643
Wait! Bring it back!

418
00:32:35,412 --> 00:32:39,416
- He's coming this way!
- He won't get far. Archers!

419
00:33:47,234 --> 00:33:50,445
We're dead. So very, very dead.

420
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:53,240
Not yet we're not. Now!

421
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:43,665
- Can we run now?
- Yes.

422
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:05,687
I'm glad Shifu sent you.

423
00:35:07,981 --> 00:35:10,776
I was beginning to think
I'd been forgotten.

424
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:12,903
Fly back there and tell them

425
00:35:12,986 --> 00:35:16,698
the real Dragon Warrior
is coming home.

426
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,212
- Good morning, Master!
- Good morning, Master!

427
00:35:31,713 --> 00:35:34,382
Panda!

428
00:35:34,758 --> 00:35:35,967
Wake up!

429
00:35:39,513 --> 00:35:40,722
He's quit.

430
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:45,727
What do we do now, Master,
with the panda gone?

431
00:35:45,811 --> 00:35:47,813
Who will be the Dragon Warrior?

432
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:50,982
All we can do is resume our training
and trust that in time,

433
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:53,693
the true Dragon Warrior
will be revealed.

434
00:35:55,195 --> 00:35:56,738
What are you doing here?

435
00:35:57,656 --> 00:35:59,658
Hi! Good morning, Master!

436
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:01,576
I thought I'd warm up a little.

437
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:04,704
You're stuck.

438
00:36:04,788 --> 00:36:07,165
Stuck? No. What? Stuck?

439
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:10,961
No. This is one of my... Yeah, I'm stuck.

440
00:36:11,044 --> 00:36:12,963
- Help him.
- Oh, dear.

441
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:16,591
Maybe on three. One, two,

442
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:18,844
three.

443
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:22,264
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

444
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:25,517
- No, really, I appreciate...
- Ever.

445
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:29,646
You actually thought you could learn
to do a full split in one night?

446
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:32,858
It takes years to develop one's flexibility!

447
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:36,736
And years longer to apply it in combat!

448
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:47,873
Put that down!

449
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:52,419
The only souvenirs we collect here are
bloody knuckles and broken bones.

450
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:55,463
Yeah! Excellent.

451
00:36:56,256 --> 00:36:57,465
Let's get started.

452
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:01,636
- Are you ready?
- I was born ready...

453
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:06,641
I'm sorry, brother.
I thought you said you were ready.

454
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:10,020
That was awesome! Let's go again!

455
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:39,299
I've been taking it easy on you, panda.
But no more.

456
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:41,718
Your next opponent will be me.

457
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:43,553
All right! Yeah, let's go!

458
00:37:46,056 --> 00:37:48,433
Step forth.

459
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:51,645
The true path to victory is to find
your opponent's weakness

460
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:53,605
and make him suffer for it.

461
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:54,981
Oh, yeah!

462
00:37:55,065 --> 00:37:58,443
To take his strength
and use it against him

463
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:00,987
until he finally falls

464
00:38:01,071 --> 00:38:02,072
or quits.

465
00:38:02,155 --> 00:38:04,199
A real warrior never quits.

466
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:07,494
Don't worry, Master. I will never quit!

467
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:20,882
If he's smart,
he won't come back up those steps.

468
00:38:20,966 --> 00:38:22,300
But he will.

469
00:38:22,384 --> 00:38:24,636
He's not going to quit, is he?

470
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:27,514
He's not going to quit bouncing,
I'll tell you that.

471
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:42,445
I thought you said acupuncture
would make me feel better.

472
00:38:42,529 --> 00:38:43,530
Trust me, it will.

473
00:38:43,613 --> 00:38:47,242
It's just not easy finding the right
nerve points under all this...

474
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,995
- Fat?
- Fur. I was going to say fur.

475
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:51,037
Sure you were.

476
00:38:51,121 --> 00:38:55,208
Who am I to judge a warrior
based on his size? Look at me.

477
00:38:56,376 --> 00:38:57,377
I'm over here.

478
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:00,880
Maybe you should look at this again.

479
00:39:00,964 --> 00:39:03,425
Oh, okay.

480
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:08,263
Stop it. Stop!

481
00:39:09,431 --> 00:39:12,392
I know Master Shifu is trying
to inspire me and all,

482
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:16,271
but if I didn't know any better,
I'd say he was trying to get rid of me.

483
00:39:21,234 --> 00:39:23,611
I know he can seem kind of heartless,

484
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:26,197
but he wasn't always like that.

485
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:27,615
According to legend,

486
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:32,203
there was once a time when
Master Shifu actually used to smile.

487
00:39:32,287 --> 00:39:34,205
- No!
- Yes.

488
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:35,540
But that was before.

489
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:37,625
Before what?

490
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:39,044
Before Tai Lung.

491
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:41,713
We're not really supposed
to talk about him.

492
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:44,758
Well, if he's going to stay here,
he should know.

493
00:39:44,841 --> 00:39:46,760
Guys, guys, I know about Tai Lung.

494
00:39:46,843 --> 00:39:52,307
He was a student. The first ever to
master the thousand scrolls of kung fu.

495
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:56,561
And then he turned bad,
and now he's in jail.

496
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:58,772
He wasn'tjust a student.

497
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:05,945
Shifu found him as a cub

498
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:10,492
and he raised him as his son.

499
00:40:12,869 --> 00:40:15,955
And when the boy showed
talent in kung fu,

500
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,292
Shifu trained him.

501
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:23,505
He believed in him. He told him
he was destined for greatness.

502
00:40:25,215 --> 00:40:26,966
It was never enough for Tai Lung.

503
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:31,304
He wanted the Dragon Scroll.

504
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:36,184
But Oogway saw darkness
in his heart and refused.

505
00:40:36,518 --> 00:40:40,230
Outraged, Tai Lung
laid waste to the valley.

506
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:44,734
He tried to take the scroll by force.

507
00:40:44,818 --> 00:40:49,405
And Shifu had to destroy
what he had created.

508
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:52,283
But how could he?

509
00:41:06,506 --> 00:41:10,677
Shifu loved Tai Lung
like he had never loved anyone before.

510
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,186
Or since.

511
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:31,823
And now he has a chance
to make things right.

512
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:34,159
To train the true Dragon Warrior.

513
00:41:34,242 --> 00:41:36,911
And he's stuck with you.

514
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:40,874
A big fat panda who treats it like a joke.

515
00:41:41,875 --> 00:41:42,876
That is it!

516
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:46,087
Wait! My fault!
I accidentally tweaked his facial nerve.

517
00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:50,884
And may have also stopped his heart.

518
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:56,222
Inner peace.

519
00:41:57,807 --> 00:41:59,684
Inner peace.

520
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:04,105
Inner...

521
00:42:05,732 --> 00:42:07,609
Inner peace.

522
00:42:10,612 --> 00:42:15,116
Would whoever is making
that flapping sound quiet down?

523
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,621
Inner...

524
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,294
Oh, Zeng.

525
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:27,962
Excellent.

526
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:29,964
I could use some good news right now.

527
00:42:37,764 --> 00:42:39,140
Master! Master!

528
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:44,062
I have... It's... It's very bad news.

529
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:46,481
Shifu.

530
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:50,318
There is just news.
There is no good or bad.

531
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:53,696
Master, your vision...
Your vision was right.

532
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:57,158
Tai Lung has broken out of prison.
He's on his way.

533
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:01,371
That is bad news

534
00:43:01,454 --> 00:43:05,833
ifyou do not believe
that the Dragon Warrior can stop him.

535
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:10,171
The panda? Master,
that panda is not the Dragon Warrior.

536
00:43:10,255 --> 00:43:13,549
He wasn't meant to be here!
It was an accident.

537
00:43:13,633 --> 00:43:15,927
There are no accidents.

538
00:43:17,178 --> 00:43:20,265
Yes, I know. You've said that already.

539
00:43:20,348 --> 00:43:24,560
- Twice.
- Well, that was no accident, either.

540
00:43:24,644 --> 00:43:25,728
Thrice.

541
00:43:25,812 --> 00:43:27,438
My old friend,

542
00:43:27,522 --> 00:43:32,110
the panda will never fulfill
his destiny, nor you yours,

543
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:35,738
until you let go ofthe illusion of control.

544
00:43:35,822 --> 00:43:37,156
Illusion?

545
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:40,243
Yes. Look at this tree, Shifu.

546
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:43,329
I cannot make it blossom
when it suits me,

547
00:43:43,413 --> 00:43:46,666
nor make it bear fruit before its time.

548
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:49,294
But there are things we can control.

549
00:43:50,378 --> 00:43:53,464
I can control when the fruit will fall.

550
00:43:54,549 --> 00:43:56,217
And I can control

551
00:43:57,302 --> 00:43:59,304
where to plant the seed.

552
00:43:59,804 --> 00:44:01,889
That is no illusion, Master.

553
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,601
Yes.

554
00:44:05,685 --> 00:44:08,062
But no matterwhat you do

555
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:11,065
that seed will grow to be a peach tree.

556
00:44:11,149 --> 00:44:15,987
You may wish for an apple
or an orange, but you will get a peach.

557
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:19,699
But a peach cannot defeat Tai Lung!

558
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:22,452
Maybe it can.

559
00:44:22,535 --> 00:44:25,330
Ifyou are willing to guide it.

560
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:27,248
To nurture it.

561
00:44:27,332 --> 00:44:28,708
To believe in it.

562
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:31,252
But how? How?

563
00:44:31,336 --> 00:44:33,296
I need your help, Master.

564
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:37,091
No, you just need to believe.

565
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:40,094
Promise me, Shifu.

566
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:43,348
Promise me you will believe.

567
00:44:43,431 --> 00:44:47,018
I will try.

568
00:44:47,852 --> 00:44:49,354
Good.

569
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:53,524
My time has come.

570
00:44:55,735 --> 00:45:00,073
You must continue
your journey without me.

571
00:45:00,156 --> 00:45:01,866
What are you... Wait!

572
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:05,203
Master!

573
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:07,622
You can't leave me!

574
00:45:11,376 --> 00:45:14,003
You must believe.

575
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:16,547
Master!

576
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:49,622
Yeah, so I'm like,
"Fine, you may be a wolf,

577
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:52,667
you may be the scariest bandit
in Haijin Province,

578
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,794
but you're a lousy tipper.

579
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:57,839
Really? So how did you
get out ofthere alive?

580
00:45:58,673 --> 00:46:01,008
I mean, I didn't actually say that,

581
00:46:01,342 --> 00:46:02,844
but I thought it

582
00:46:02,927 --> 00:46:04,679
in my mind.

583
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:07,849
If he could read my mind,
he'd be, like, "What?"

584
00:46:08,391 --> 00:46:10,560
Order up! Hope you like it.

585
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:15,690
- This is really good!
- No, come on.

586
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:20,069
Try my dad's Secret Ingredient Soup.
He actually knows the secret ingredient.

587
00:46:20,153 --> 00:46:22,530
What are you talking about?
This is amazing!

588
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:25,533
- You're a really good cook.
- I wish my mouth was bigger.

589
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:27,493
Tigress, you've got to try this.

590
00:46:27,577 --> 00:46:31,205
It is said that the Dragon Warrior
can survive for months at a time

591
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:33,833
on nothing but the dew
of a single ginkgo leaf

592
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:35,668
and the energy ofthe universe.

593
00:46:37,462 --> 00:46:41,340
I guess my body doesn't know
it's the Dragon Warrior yet.

594
00:46:41,424 --> 00:46:46,429
I'm gonna need a lot more
than dew and universe juice.

595
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:53,895
- What?
- Nothing, Master Shifu.

596
00:46:56,731 --> 00:46:58,232
You'll never be the Dragon Warrior

597
00:46:58,316 --> 00:47:00,902
unless you lose 500 pounds
and brush your teeth!

598
00:47:01,986 --> 00:47:05,490
What is that noise you're making?
Laughter? I never heard of it!

599
00:47:05,573 --> 00:47:08,367
Work hard, panda, and maybe someday

600
00:47:08,451 --> 00:47:10,369
you will have ears like mine.

601
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:13,372
That's good.

602
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:17,376
Ears. It's not working for you?
I thought they were pretty good.

603
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:18,836
It's Shifu!

604
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:21,756
Of course it's Shifu.
What do you think I'm doing?

605
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:25,134
Master Shifu!

606
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:29,847
You think this is funny?

607
00:47:29,931 --> 00:47:32,892
Tai Lung has escaped
and you're acting like children!

608
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:35,269
- What?
- He is coming for the Dragon Scroll,

609
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:37,730
and you are the only one
who can stop him.

610
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,028
And here I am saying
you got no sense of humor.

611
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:46,364
I'm gonna stop Tai Lung.

612
00:47:46,447 --> 00:47:49,283
What? You're serious? And I have to...

613
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:54,121
Master Oogway will stop him,
he did it before, he'll do it again.

614
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:55,748
Oogway cannot!

615
00:47:56,249 --> 00:47:57,625
Not anymore.

616
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:01,712
Our only hope is the Dragon Warrior.

617
00:48:01,796 --> 00:48:03,464
- The panda?
- Yes, the panda!

618
00:48:03,548 --> 00:48:07,134
Master, let us stop Tai Lung.
This is what you've trained us for.

619
00:48:07,218 --> 00:48:10,429
No! It is not your destiny
to defeat Tai Lung.

620
00:48:10,513 --> 00:48:12,765
It is his!

621
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:13,975
Where'd he go?

622
00:48:20,982 --> 00:48:24,443
You cannot leave!
A real warrior never quits.

623
00:48:24,527 --> 00:48:26,112
Watch me.

624
00:48:28,531 --> 00:48:29,615
Come on.

625
00:48:29,699 --> 00:48:33,536
How am I supposed to beat Tai Lung?
I can't even beat you to the stairs.

626
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:36,622
You will beat him
because you are the Dragon Warrior.

627
00:48:37,415 --> 00:48:40,668
You don't believe that.
You never believed that.

628
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:43,754
From the beginning,
you've tried to get rid of me.

629
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:46,132
Yes! I was.

630
00:48:46,215 --> 00:48:51,345
But now I ask you to trust in your master
as I have come to trust in mine.

631
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:56,142
You're not my master.
And I'm not the Dragon Warrior.

632
00:48:56,225 --> 00:48:57,852
Then why didn't you quit?

633
00:48:57,977 --> 00:49:00,563
You knew I was trying to get rid ofyou,
yet you stayed.

634
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:02,732
Yeah, I stayed.

635
00:49:02,815 --> 00:49:06,569
I stayed because every time
you threw a brick at my head

636
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:11,032
or said I smelled, it hurt,
but it could never hurt more

637
00:49:11,115 --> 00:49:14,368
than it did every day
of my life just being me.

638
00:49:15,328 --> 00:49:19,665
I stayed because I thought,
if anyone could change me,

639
00:49:19,999 --> 00:49:23,044
could make me not me,

640
00:49:23,127 --> 00:49:24,503
it was you,

641
00:49:24,712 --> 00:49:27,673
the greatest kung fu teacher
in all of China!

642
00:49:27,757 --> 00:49:29,342
But I can change you!

643
00:49:29,425 --> 00:49:32,970
I can turn you into the Dragon Warrior!
And I will!

644
00:49:33,054 --> 00:49:37,016
Come on. Tai Lung is
on his way here right now.

645
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:40,478
Even if it takes him a hundred years
to get here, how are you

646
00:49:40,561 --> 00:49:44,857
gonna change this
into the Dragon Warrior?

647
00:49:47,443 --> 00:49:48,444
How?

648
00:49:50,071 --> 00:49:51,072
How?

649
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:56,035
- How?
- I don't know!

650
00:50:04,085 --> 00:50:05,628
I don't know.

651
00:50:12,218 --> 00:50:14,428
That's what I thought.

652
00:50:53,092 --> 00:50:55,261
This is what you trained me for.

653
00:51:02,393 --> 00:51:03,394
Tigress!

654
00:51:07,648 --> 00:51:09,442
Don't try and stop me.

655
00:51:12,153 --> 00:51:13,696
We're not trying to stop you.

656
00:51:13,779 --> 00:51:14,739
What?

657
00:51:14,822 --> 00:51:16,699
We're coming with you!

658
00:52:29,939 --> 00:52:33,484
What? I eat when I'm upset, okay?

659
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:35,945
No need to explain.

660
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:37,530
I thought you might be Monkey.

661
00:52:37,613 --> 00:52:40,324
He hides his almond cookies
on the top shelf.

662
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:02,888
Don't tell Monkey.

663
00:53:02,972 --> 00:53:06,141
- Look at you.
- Yeah, I know, I disgust you.

664
00:53:06,225 --> 00:53:09,186
No, I mean, how did you get up there?

665
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:12,064
I don't know. I guess...

666
00:53:12,398 --> 00:53:14,692
I don't know. I was getting a cookie.

667
00:53:14,775 --> 00:53:16,652
Yet you are ten feet offthe ground.

668
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:20,030
And have done a perfect spilt.

669
00:53:20,114 --> 00:53:23,075
No, this? This is just

670
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:25,119
an accident.

671
00:53:29,373 --> 00:53:32,418
There are no accidents.

672
00:53:32,501 --> 00:53:33,586
Come with me.

673
00:53:41,594 --> 00:53:45,014
I know you're trying to be
all mystical and kung fuey,

674
00:53:45,097 --> 00:53:47,808
but could you at least
tell me where we're going?

675
00:53:57,735 --> 00:54:00,195
You dragged me

676
00:54:00,279 --> 00:54:01,947
all the way out here

677
00:54:02,031 --> 00:54:03,449
for a bath?

678
00:54:06,994 --> 00:54:08,287
Panda,

679
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:11,999
we do not wash our pits
in the Pool of Sacred Tears.

680
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:14,251
The Pool of...

681
00:54:14,335 --> 00:54:17,254
This is where Oogway
unraveled the mysteries

682
00:54:17,338 --> 00:54:19,214
of harmony and focus.

683
00:54:19,298 --> 00:54:21,800
This is the birthplace

684
00:54:21,884 --> 00:54:23,177
of kung fu.

685
00:54:37,149 --> 00:54:39,401
Do you want to learn kung fu?

686
00:54:39,485 --> 00:54:40,444
Yeah!

687
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:44,031
Then I am your master!

688
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:45,699
Okay!

689
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:48,077
Don't cry.

690
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,495
Okay.

691
00:54:55,209 --> 00:54:57,211
When you focus on kung fu,

692
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:59,421
when you concentrate,

693
00:54:59,505 --> 00:55:01,173
you stink.

694
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:02,967
Perhaps that is my fault.

695
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:06,512
I cannot train you the way
I have trained the Five.

696
00:55:06,595 --> 00:55:09,682
I now see that the way
to get through to you

697
00:55:09,765 --> 00:55:11,058
is with this.

698
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:13,894
Oh, great, 'cause I am hungry.

699
00:55:14,853 --> 00:55:15,854
Good.

700
00:55:15,938 --> 00:55:18,649
When you have been trained,
you may eat.

701
00:55:19,942 --> 00:55:21,110
Let us begin.

702
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:33,098
After you, panda.

703
00:56:33,182 --> 00:56:35,142
Just like that?

704
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:38,729
No sit-ups? No 10-mile hike?

705
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:43,317
I vowed to train you, and you
have been trained. You are free to eat.

706
00:56:48,739 --> 00:56:50,324
Enjoy.

707
00:56:51,909 --> 00:56:53,327
Hey!

708
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:56,538
I said you are free to eat.
Have a dumpling.

709
00:56:57,873 --> 00:56:59,333
Hey!

710
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:07,508
You are free to eat.

711
00:57:07,591 --> 00:57:09,510
- Am I?
- Are you?

712
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:37,472
I'm not hungry.

713
00:58:41,101 --> 00:58:42,269
Master.

714
00:59:12,466 --> 00:59:13,800
Cut it!

715
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:32,778
Where's the Dragon Warrior?

716
00:59:32,861 --> 00:59:35,864
How do you know
you're not looking at her?

717
00:59:35,948 --> 00:59:38,116
You think I'm a fool?

718
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:41,828
I know you're not the Dragon Warrior.
None ofyou!

719
00:59:41,912 --> 00:59:45,165
I heard how he fell out ofthe sky
in a ball of fire.

720
00:59:45,249 --> 00:59:49,670
That he's a warrior unlike
anything the world has ever seen.

721
00:59:49,753 --> 00:59:55,342
- Po?
- So that is his name. Po.

722
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:58,512
Finally, a worthy opponent.

723
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:01,098
Our battle will be legendary!

724
01:00:21,076 --> 01:00:22,786
We've got this. Help her.

725
01:00:47,561 --> 01:00:48,562
Monkey!

726
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:50,480
Go!

727
01:00:50,564 --> 01:00:51,732
What was I thinking?

728
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:03,243
Mantis!

729
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:09,374
Now!

730
01:01:55,295 --> 01:01:57,589
Shifu taught you well.

731
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:02,552
But he didn't teach you everything.

732
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,141
You have done well, panda.

733
01:02:08,225 --> 01:02:11,895
Done well? Done well?

734
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:13,313
I've done awesome!

735
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:18,193
The mark of a true hero is humility.

736
01:02:18,276 --> 01:02:20,987
But, yes, you have done

737
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:22,906
awesome.

738
01:02:30,163 --> 01:02:33,458
Guys? Guys? They're dead!

739
01:02:33,542 --> 01:02:36,962
No, they're breathing. They're asleep?
No, their eyes are open.

740
01:02:37,045 --> 01:02:39,047
We were no match for his nerve attack.

741
01:02:39,131 --> 01:02:41,341
He's gotten stronger.

742
01:02:41,425 --> 01:02:43,718
Who? Tai Lung? Stronger?

743
01:02:44,928 --> 01:02:46,471
He's too fast!

744
01:02:46,555 --> 01:02:48,140
Sorry, Po.

745
01:02:49,641 --> 01:02:51,184
I thought we could stop him.

746
01:02:51,268 --> 01:02:53,103
He could have killed you.

747
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:54,229
Why didn't he?

748
01:02:54,312 --> 01:02:59,109
So you could come back and strike fear
into our hearts. But it won't work.

749
01:02:59,192 --> 01:03:03,113
It might. I mean, a little.

750
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:04,448
I'm pretty scared.

751
01:03:04,531 --> 01:03:05,991
You can defeat him, panda!

752
01:03:06,074 --> 01:03:08,994
Are you kidding? Ifthey can't?

753
01:03:09,077 --> 01:03:12,080
They're five masters. I'm just one me.

754
01:03:12,164 --> 01:03:15,542
But you will have
the one thing that no one else does.

755
01:03:20,881 --> 01:03:23,341
You really believe I'm ready?

756
01:03:23,425 --> 01:03:25,093
You are,

757
01:03:25,177 --> 01:03:26,470
Po.

758
01:04:15,477 --> 01:04:19,022
Behold the Dragon Scroll.

759
01:04:19,105 --> 01:04:21,024
It is yours.

760
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:24,027
Wait. What happens when I read it?

761
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:25,111
No one knows.

762
01:04:25,195 --> 01:04:28,156
But legend says you will be able
to hear a butterfly's wing beat.

763
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:30,450
Really? That's cool.

764
01:04:30,534 --> 01:04:33,370
Yes. And see light in the deepest cave.

765
01:04:33,453 --> 01:04:36,331
You will feel the universe
in motion around you.

766
01:04:36,998 --> 01:04:38,416
Can I punch through walls?

767
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:40,877
- Can I do a quadruple back flip?
- Focus.

768
01:04:40,961 --> 01:04:42,128
- Will I have invisibility...
- Focus.

769
01:04:42,546 --> 01:04:43,922
- Focus.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

770
01:04:44,005 --> 01:04:46,883
Read it, Po, and fulfill your destiny.

771
01:04:46,967 --> 01:04:49,177
Read it and become

772
01:04:49,261 --> 01:04:50,971
the Dragon Warrior.

773
01:04:57,894 --> 01:04:59,312
It's impossible to open.

774
01:05:00,313 --> 01:05:03,608
Okay. Come on, baby. Come on, now.

775
01:05:05,819 --> 01:05:07,445
Thank you.

776
01:05:07,529 --> 01:05:09,948
I probably loosened it up for you though.

777
01:05:11,241 --> 01:05:12,784
Okay, here goes.

778
01:05:24,796 --> 01:05:26,423
- It's blank.
- What?

779
01:05:26,506 --> 01:05:30,135
- Here, look.
- No, I am forbidden to look upon...

780
01:05:35,849 --> 01:05:38,685
Blank. I don't...

781
01:05:38,810 --> 01:05:40,979
I don't understand.

782
01:05:42,272 --> 01:05:44,941
Okay. So, like,

783
01:05:45,025 --> 01:05:48,278
Oogway was
just a crazy old turtle after all.

784
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:50,947
No. Oogway was wiser than us all.

785
01:05:51,031 --> 01:05:55,076
Oh, come on! Face it,
he picked me by accident.

786
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:59,289
Of course I'm not the Dragon Warrior.
Who am I kidding?

787
01:06:00,332 --> 01:06:02,000
But who will stop Tai Lung?

788
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:05,128
He'll destroy everything and everyone.

789
01:06:05,211 --> 01:06:06,630
No.

790
01:06:06,713 --> 01:06:12,052
Evacuate the valley. You must protect
the villagers from Tai Lung's rage.

791
01:06:12,135 --> 01:06:14,512
- What about you, Master?
- I will fight him.

792
01:06:14,596 --> 01:06:17,307
- What?
- I can hold him off long enough

793
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:18,808
for everyone to escape.

794
01:06:18,892 --> 01:06:21,311
But, Shifu, he'll kill you.

795
01:06:21,394 --> 01:06:24,230
Then I will finally have paid
for my mistake.

796
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:27,317
Listen to me, all ofyou.

797
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:30,904
It is time for you to continue
your journey without me.

798
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:33,990
I am very proud
to have been your master.

799
01:06:54,761 --> 01:06:57,138
We've got to get them out safely.

800
01:06:57,222 --> 01:06:59,516
Come, little one. Let's find your mama.

801
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:03,186
Viper, gather the southern farmers.
Mantis, the north.

802
01:07:03,269 --> 01:07:05,021
Crane, light the way.

803
01:07:24,082 --> 01:07:27,127
Look, it's the Dragon Warrior.

804
01:07:35,802 --> 01:07:37,220
Hey, Dad.

805
01:07:37,804 --> 01:07:39,139
Po!

806
01:07:45,019 --> 01:07:47,147
Good to have you back, son.

807
01:07:49,607 --> 01:07:51,067
Good to be back.

808
01:07:51,151 --> 01:07:52,819
Let's go, Po.

809
01:07:55,321 --> 01:07:58,116
So for our next shop, it's time to face it,

810
01:07:58,199 --> 01:08:01,703
the future of noodles
is dice-cut vegetables,

811
01:08:01,828 --> 01:08:04,247
no longer slices.

812
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:07,584
Also, I was thinking, maybe this time

813
01:08:07,667 --> 01:08:11,087
we'll have a kitchen
you can actually stand up in.

814
01:08:12,297 --> 01:08:13,506
You like that?

815
01:08:19,721 --> 01:08:24,309
Po, I'm sorry things didn't work out.

816
01:08:24,392 --> 01:08:27,437
Itjust wasn't meant to be.

817
01:08:30,899 --> 01:08:33,401
Po, forget everything else.

818
01:08:33,485 --> 01:08:35,653
Your destiny still awaits.

819
01:08:35,737 --> 01:08:40,867
We are noodle folk.
Broth runs deep through our veins.

820
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:42,869
I don't know, Dad.

821
01:08:42,952 --> 01:08:46,956
Honestly, sometimes
I can't believe I'm actually your son.

822
01:08:50,335 --> 01:08:51,419
Po,

823
01:08:51,503 --> 01:08:55,924
I think it's time I told you
something I should have told you

824
01:08:56,007 --> 01:08:58,051
a long time ago.

825
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:00,512
Okay.

826
01:09:01,221 --> 01:09:05,433
The secret ingredient
of my Secret Ingredient Soup.

827
01:09:08,186 --> 01:09:12,816
Come here. The secret ingredient is

828
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:13,900
nothing.

829
01:09:15,276 --> 01:09:17,695
You heard me. Nothing!

830
01:09:17,779 --> 01:09:20,240
There is no secret ingredient!

831
01:09:20,323 --> 01:09:23,368
Wait, wait.
It's just plain old noodle soup?

832
01:09:23,451 --> 01:09:25,954
You don't add some kind of
special sauce or something?

833
01:09:26,037 --> 01:09:28,331
Don't have to.
To make something special,

834
01:09:28,414 --> 01:09:31,417
you just have to believe it's special.

835
01:09:41,469 --> 01:09:43,972
There is no secret ingredient.

836
01:10:06,578 --> 01:10:09,372
I have come home, Master.

837
01:10:09,455 --> 01:10:12,709
This is no longer your home.
And I am no longer your master.

838
01:10:12,792 --> 01:10:16,713
Oh, yes. You have a new favorite.

839
01:10:16,796 --> 01:10:19,883
So where is this Po?

840
01:10:21,301 --> 01:10:22,552
Did I scare him off?

841
01:10:22,635 --> 01:10:24,971
This battle is between you and me.

842
01:10:26,347 --> 01:10:29,475
So, that is how it's going to be.

843
01:10:29,559 --> 01:10:31,603
That is how it must be.

844
01:10:46,034 --> 01:10:50,580
I rotted in jail for 20 years
because ofyourweakness!

845
01:10:50,663 --> 01:10:53,041
Obeying your master is not weakness!

846
01:10:53,124 --> 01:10:55,919
You knew I was the Dragon Warrior.

847
01:10:56,002 --> 01:10:58,129
You always knew.

848
01:10:58,212 --> 01:11:03,217
But when Oogway said otherwise,
what did you do?

849
01:11:04,344 --> 01:11:06,888
What did you do?

850
01:11:09,349 --> 01:11:10,433
Nothing!

851
01:11:10,516 --> 01:11:13,353
You were not meant to be the Dragon
Warrior! That was not my fault!

852
01:11:13,436 --> 01:11:15,188
Not your fault?

853
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:17,398
Who filled my head with dreams?

854
01:11:17,482 --> 01:11:19,817
Who drove me to train
until my bones cracked?

855
01:11:19,901 --> 01:11:22,654
Who denied me my destiny?

856
01:11:31,871 --> 01:11:34,499
It was never my decision to make!

857
01:11:39,963 --> 01:11:41,255
It is now.

858
01:11:46,803 --> 01:11:49,889
Give me the scroll!

859
01:11:49,973 --> 01:11:51,224
I would rather die.

860
01:12:41,607 --> 01:12:44,736
All I ever did, I did to make you proud!

861
01:12:44,902 --> 01:12:47,405
Tell me how proud you are, Shifu!

862
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:49,866
Tell me!

863
01:12:50,408 --> 01:12:52,118
Tell me!

864
01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:05,798
I have...
I have always been proud ofyou.

865
01:13:06,924 --> 01:13:10,219
From the first moment, I've been

866
01:13:10,303 --> 01:13:12,597
proud ofyou.

867
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:15,058
And it was my pride

868
01:13:15,141 --> 01:13:17,143
that blinded me.

869
01:13:17,226 --> 01:13:20,813
I loved you too much
to see what you were becoming,

870
01:13:21,814 --> 01:13:24,067
what I

871
01:13:24,150 --> 01:13:26,152
was turning you into.

872
01:13:26,944 --> 01:13:28,905
I'm...

873
01:13:28,988 --> 01:13:29,989
I'm sorry.

874
01:13:38,498 --> 01:13:41,209
I don't want your apology.

875
01:13:41,292 --> 01:13:42,835
I want my scroll!

876
01:13:44,921 --> 01:13:46,923
What?

877
01:13:47,006 --> 01:13:48,216
Where is it?

878
01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:54,180
Dragon Warrior has taken the scroll
halfway across China by now.

879
01:13:55,306 --> 01:13:58,434
You will never see that scroll, Tai Lung.

880
01:13:58,518 --> 01:13:59,852
Never.

881
01:14:00,770 --> 01:14:01,771
Never.

882
01:14:08,778 --> 01:14:10,071
Stairs.

883
01:14:12,532 --> 01:14:14,283
Who are you?

884
01:14:14,367 --> 01:14:19,413
Buddy, I am the Dragon Warrior.

885
01:14:22,416 --> 01:14:23,751
You?

886
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:26,671
Him? He's a panda.

887
01:14:26,754 --> 01:14:30,633
You're a panda. What are
you gonna do, big guy? Sit on me?

888
01:14:30,716 --> 01:14:32,635
Don't tempt me.

889
01:14:32,718 --> 01:14:36,722
No. I'm gonna use this.

890
01:14:36,806 --> 01:14:38,432
You want it? Come and get it.

891
01:14:40,184 --> 01:14:41,477
Finally!

892
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:08,963
That scroll is mine!

893
01:16:02,808 --> 01:16:03,809
Lightning!

894
01:16:39,011 --> 01:16:41,013
The scroll has given him power!

895
01:16:41,681 --> 01:16:43,224
No!

896
01:17:19,343 --> 01:17:23,264
Finally! Oh, yes.

897
01:17:23,347 --> 01:17:28,227
The power ofthe Dragon Scroll is mine!

898
01:17:33,024 --> 01:17:35,067
It's nothing!

899
01:17:37,028 --> 01:17:39,613
It's okay. I didn't get it
the first time, either.

900
01:17:40,114 --> 01:17:41,157
What?

901
01:17:42,325 --> 01:17:44,118
There is no secret ingredient.

902
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:48,914
It's just you.

903
01:17:58,674 --> 01:17:59,717
Stop it!

904
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:01,594
I'm gonna pee.

905
01:18:03,220 --> 01:18:04,388
Don't.

906
01:18:04,472 --> 01:18:06,140
Don't! Don't!

907
01:19:13,916 --> 01:19:15,709
You

908
01:19:15,793 --> 01:19:18,003
can't defeat me.

909
01:19:22,466 --> 01:19:23,676
You...

910
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:26,804
You're just a big

911
01:19:26,887 --> 01:19:28,472
fat

912
01:19:28,556 --> 01:19:29,557
panda!

913
01:19:30,516 --> 01:19:33,644
I'm not a big fat panda.

914
01:19:33,727 --> 01:19:36,021
I'm the big fat panda.

915
01:19:38,190 --> 01:19:39,608
The Wuxi Finger Hold!

916
01:19:39,692 --> 01:19:41,110
Oh, you know this hold?

917
01:19:41,193 --> 01:19:45,114
You're bluffing. You're bluffing.
Shifu didn't teach you that.

918
01:19:45,197 --> 01:19:46,907
Nope.

919
01:19:46,991 --> 01:19:49,201
I figured it out. Skadoosh.

920
01:20:09,722 --> 01:20:10,931
Look!

921
01:20:11,974 --> 01:20:14,059
The Dragon Warrior.

922
01:20:41,545 --> 01:20:46,425
That's my boy! That big, lovely
kung fu warrior is my son!

923
01:20:48,469 --> 01:20:49,595
Yes!

924
01:20:50,846 --> 01:20:52,431
Thanks, Dad.

925
01:21:02,024 --> 01:21:03,484
Hey, guys.

926
01:21:07,780 --> 01:21:09,114
Master.

927
01:21:09,198 --> 01:21:10,616
- Master.
- Master.

928
01:21:13,536 --> 01:21:15,287
Master?

929
01:21:15,371 --> 01:21:16,830
Master Shifu!

930
01:21:30,469 --> 01:21:31,845
Master!

931
01:21:31,929 --> 01:21:34,014
Shifu, are you okay?

932
01:21:35,766 --> 01:21:37,142
Po.

933
01:21:37,226 --> 01:21:39,144
You're alive.

934
01:21:39,228 --> 01:21:40,437
Orwe're both dead.

935
01:21:40,521 --> 01:21:44,441
No, Master, I didn't die.
I defeated Tai Lung.

936
01:21:44,525 --> 01:21:45,651
You did?

937
01:21:49,947 --> 01:21:55,661
Wow. It is as Oogway foretold.

938
01:21:55,744 --> 01:21:59,248
You are the Dragon Warrior.

939
01:21:59,999 --> 01:22:02,501
You have brought peace

940
01:22:02,585 --> 01:22:05,337
to this valley

941
01:22:05,421 --> 01:22:07,590
and...

942
01:22:07,673 --> 01:22:09,300
And to me.

943
01:22:09,383 --> 01:22:10,676
Thank you.

944
01:22:12,511 --> 01:22:15,723
Thank you, Po.

945
01:22:15,806 --> 01:22:18,392
Thank you. Thank you.

946
01:22:23,897 --> 01:22:28,902
No! Master! No, no, no,
don't die, Shifu, please!

947
01:22:28,986 --> 01:22:31,697
I'm not dying, you idiot!

948
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:33,741
Dragon Warrior.

949
01:22:35,034 --> 01:22:39,872
I am simply at peace. Finally.

950
01:22:42,583 --> 01:22:45,544
So, I should stop talking?

951
01:22:46,211 --> 01:22:47,880
Ifyou can.

952
01:23:06,023 --> 01:23:07,608
Want to get something to eat?

953
01:23:10,277 --> 01:23:11,403
Yeah.

954
01:23:17,409 --> 01:23:20,788
Everybody is kung fu fighting

955
01:23:21,622 --> 01:23:24,958
Your mind becomes fast as lightning

956
01:23:25,959 --> 01:23:29,296
Although the future
is a little bit frightening

957
01:23:30,464 --> 01:23:33,967
It's the book of your life
that you're writing

958
01:23:37,096 --> 01:23:40,140
Everybody is kung fu fighting

959
01:23:41,433 --> 01:23:44,645
Your mind becomes fast as lightning

960
01:23:45,646 --> 01:23:48,982
Although the future
is a little bit frightening

961
01:23:50,317 --> 01:23:53,320
It's the book of your life
that you're writing

962
01:23:55,155 --> 01:23:57,366
You are a natural

963
01:23:57,449 --> 01:23:59,660
Why is that so hard to see?

964
01:23:59,743 --> 01:24:03,914
Maybe it's just because
You keep on looking at me

965
01:24:03,997 --> 01:24:08,085
The journey's a lonely one
So much more than we know

966
01:24:08,168 --> 01:24:12,047
But sometimes you've got to go
And be your own hero

967
01:24:12,131 --> 01:24:15,092
Everybody is kung fu fighting

968
01:24:16,301 --> 01:24:19,513
Your mind becomes fast as lightning

969
01:24:20,556 --> 01:24:23,976
Although the future
is a little bit frightening

970
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:28,313
It's the book of your life
that you're writing

971
01:24:29,982 --> 01:24:34,236
You're a diamond in the rough
A brilliant ball of clay

972
01:24:34,319 --> 01:24:38,407
You could be a work of art
if you just go all the way

973
01:24:38,490 --> 01:24:42,286
Now what would it take to break?
I believe that you can bend

974
01:24:42,369 --> 01:24:46,749
Not only do you have to fight
But you have got to win

975
01:24:46,832 --> 01:24:49,960
'Cause everybody is kung fu fighting

976
01:24:51,253 --> 01:24:54,298
Your mind becomes fast as lightning

977
01:24:55,507 --> 01:24:58,635
Although the future
is a little bit frightening

978
01:25:00,012 --> 01:25:03,182
It's the book of your life
that you're writing

979
01:25:05,017 --> 01:25:08,604
You're a diamond in the rough
A brilliant ball of clay

980
01:25:09,354 --> 01:25:13,776
You could be a work of art
If you just go all the way

981
01:25:13,859 --> 01:25:17,905
Now what would it take to break?
I believe that you can bend

982
01:25:17,988 --> 01:25:21,742
Not only do you have to fight
But you have got to win

983
01:25:21,825 --> 01:25:24,912
'Cause everybody is kung fu fighting

984
01:25:26,455 --> 01:25:29,541
Your mind becomes fast as lightning

985
01:25:30,542 --> 01:25:33,754
Although the future
is a little bit frightening

986
01:25:35,214 --> 01:25:38,717
It's the book of your life
that you're writing

987
01:25:39,305 --> 01:26:39,578
