NETFLIX PRESENTS

00:00:14,208 --> 00:00:15,750
1967.

3
00:00:16,791 --> 00:00:18,291
The Summer of Love.

4
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:22,625
But can the idea of love
and peace really bring about change

5
00:00:22,708 --> 00:00:24,666
to a world living on the edge of war?

6
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:30,833
In the Middle East, long-simmering
tensions are about to burst into flames.

7
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:34,666
Egypt's popular President,
Gamal Abdel Nasser,

8
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:39,750
gathers the entire Arab nations
to join him in war against Israel.

9
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:46,458
Nasser blocks Israel's shipping channels
through the Straits of Tiran.

10
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:50,458
War seems inevitable.

11
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:53,875
Israel responds
with a devastating surprise attack.

12
00:00:55,541 --> 00:00:57,500
Within a matter of a few hours,

13
00:00:57,583 --> 00:00:59,916
the entire Egyptian Air Force
is destroyed.

14
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:04,208
Despite Syria and Jordan coming
to Egypt's aid,

15
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:05,916
fighting on three fronts...

16
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,750
Israel goes on to win the war
in only six days.

17
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,875
The Sinai Peninsula,
Golan Heights, and the West Bank,

18
00:01:15,958 --> 00:01:18,125
including East Jerusalem, fall to Israel.

19
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:23,625
As the Arab nations plot
to regain their lost territories,

20
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:26,708
certain Palestinian nationalist groups,

21
00:01:26,791 --> 00:01:30,083
living under Israeli rule
in the occupied territories...

22
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:32,416
start to plan their retaliation.

23

-== [ www.OpenSubtitles.com ] ==-

24
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:03,833
What is your business in Rome, sir?

25
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:06,791
I'm here in an official capacity.

26
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:12,166
Please remind those two gentlemen
that's all diplomatic luggage.

27
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:18,166
Guys, leave those suitcases.

28
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,583
- He has a diplomatic passport.
- No problem.

29
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:26,708
- Enjoy your stay in Rome, Mr. Marwan.
- Thank you.

30
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:14,416
Glory to Allah.

31
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:17,625
Magnificent.

32
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:20,166
Magnificent.

33
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:30,000
Flight 136
to Tel Aviv is now boarding.

34
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:54,916
- This is where I say good luck.
- Stay until it's over.

35
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:56,208
Listen to me.

36
00:03:56,958 --> 00:04:00,208
I'm an Egyptian consular official.
I cannot risk remaining here.

37
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:01,583
Ashraf...

38
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:09,250
Please send our deepest respect
and thanks to President Sadat.

39
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:13,666
Tell him we will soon see
a free Palestine.

40
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:18,750
Good luck.

41
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:26,916
Hello ladies and gentlemen,
this is your Captain speaking:

42
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:30,750
Flight duration expected
is four hours and ten minutes.

43
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:47,333
It's taking off, get ready.

44
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:19,833
Now!

45
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,833
President Nasser...

46
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:53,000
Vice President Sadat, you are welcome.

47
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:54,791
They are ready for you.

48
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:02,625
I completely agree with you,
Mr. President.

49
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:06,416
Abdullah, let's keep it in English
for the benefit of our friends.

50
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,333
Please.

51
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:09,583
The only question of importance

52
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:12,708
is the regaining
of our lands seized by Israel.

53
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:16,000
The problem is not
just the Zionist entity.

54
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:19,166
The problem is who stands behind Israel.

55
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:20,500
The United States!

56
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:23,166
Perhaps, if Israel felt threatened,

57
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,500
constrained
by United Nations resolutions...

58
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:27,791
We all know that will never happen.

59
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:32,750
Perhaps the problem is not
who stands behind Israel but behind us.

60
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,166
As the Soviet Union?

61
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:39,458
Really?

62
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:44,500
You presume to enlighten
the men at this table, Ashraf?

63
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:51,083
I'm sorry for speaking up,
Mr. President, but in the long run,

64
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:54,500
the Soviet Union will collapse
as it adheres to a flawed concept--

65
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:58,166
The Soviet Union is the only power
holding America at bay.

66
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:01,416
And this is the power you say
is going to crumble?

67
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:03,041
I believe it will.

68
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:07,416
Their system does not reward a man's
individual initiative and accomplishments.

69
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:10,416
So we need is the support
of countries that will survive,

70
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,083
notably the United States.

71
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:14,416
We know they do not want Israel attacked.

72
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:17,958
What if the Arab states offered
to the US not to attack Israel

73
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:21,875
in return for their economic support,
much more than the Soviets now provide?

74
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:24,500
But what about your lands?

75
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:26,125
What's more important?

76
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,500
Our land or our people?

77
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:31,875
Let's contact the Americans,
shift away from the Soviets

78
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:34,541
and broker the deal
between us and the Israelis.

79
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,875
I suppose

80
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:40,666
I could appoint my son-in-law
as the new American Ambassador.

81
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:45,625
And head negotiator
of the Israeli peace process.

82
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:47,833
A real visionary.

83
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:49,500
Right, Sharaf?

84
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:55,708
You know, Mr. Eastwood, Egypt's vineyards
date back to the days of the Pharaohs.

85
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:58,583
What do you think of the wine?

86
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:01,833
I had no idea that Egypt
had produced such a gem.

87
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:03,958
A toast to friends.

88
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:06,958
May we all be healthy and victorious.

89
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,708
Sa-Hit-kum.

90
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:09,916
Cheers.

91
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:12,833
And to my beautiful daughter, Mona.

92
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:14,708
The joy of my heart.

93
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,416
I'm so happy to be here in London
with you.

94
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,083
- Cheers for Mona.
- Cheers for Mona.

95
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:41,500
I can't have him
around important guests.

96
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:45,375
- You're speaking about my husband.
- Your husband? Nonsense!

97
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:47,125
He's a millstone around your neck.

98
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:51,958
What kind of example
is this man for my grandson?

99
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:55,833
Your grandson, but my son,
and Ashraf is his father!

100
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:58,916
A deadbeat father.
Better no father at all than that.

101
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:04,125
I always knew he was an idiot.
And now he embarrasses me at my table.

102
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:07,583
I should never have approved
this marriage.

103
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:37,208
Are you OK?

104
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:39,916
Ashraf?

105
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:47,458
I heard what he said to you.

106
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:50,791
It's nothing I haven't heard before.

107
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:53,625
So you approve
of the way he humiliates me?

108
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,083
- I didn't say that.
- Then, what is it?

109
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:59,291
I don't understand his issue with me.

110
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:03,041
He was upset you expressed
your thoughts at the table. Thst's all.

111
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:06,791
Mona, he's blinded by his hatred of me.

112
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:08,708
He shuts me out every time.

113
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:11,333
- He's a stubborn man.
- His stubbornness...

114
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:17,333
He sticks to an old philosophy
that obviously failed.

115
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:20,083
Ashraf...

116
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:23,916
take my advice:
be gentler when you are with him.

117
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,125
Show him you respect him.

118
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:30,083
One day, he will accept you as I do
and see the great man that you are.

119
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:32,166
Trust me,
I will work on him until he does.

120
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,375
I don't look for my daddy
in every man I meet.

121
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:38,708
My father is my father,
and you are something else.

122
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:41,583
I love you, Ashraf, just believe that.

123
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:46,791
Most notably,

124
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:50,041
the actions of this man, Garbo.

125
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,583
A failed chicken-farmer...

126
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,291
who became the greatest
double agent in history.

127
00:10:57,291 --> 00:11:00,250
Convinced that he needed
to act for the good of humanity,

128
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:05,125
Garbo set about creating
an imaginary spy ring...

129
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:08,250
of 27 English agents.

130
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:10,625
Garbo is now recognized...

131
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,416
as one of the great heroes
of World War II.

132
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:19,083
A man who, incredibly enough,
was awarded the Iron Cross by Germany

133
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:22,458
and the Order of the British Empire
by the King.

134
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,375
Bag O' Nails.

135
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:27,375
Tonight, after the group study.

136
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:28,708
Are you in?

137
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:32,375
- Let me talk to my wife.
- It's going to be a wild night.

138
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:20,083
- Ashraf! You made it!
- Yes.

139
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:24,375
I'm so glad you came. Good man. Good man.

140
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,833
- You know Diana Ellis?
- Should I?

141
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,041
Yeah, you should.

142
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,708
- Why do you ask?
- Because she's right behind you.

143
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:38,250
Rory, darling.

144
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:41,916
Who's your handsome friend?

145
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:44,750
Ashraf Marwan, Diana Ellis.

146
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:49,000
- He's the one I told you about.
- Oh my, aren't you exotic?

147
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:51,916
Do you like parties?

148
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:55,083
- Parties? Yes, I like parties.
- Adult parties?

149
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:57,791
They're at my house. You should come.

150
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:01,125
Adult parties.
That sounds very... swinging.

151
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:05,333
- I might let you come for free.
- People pay to attend your parties?

152
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:07,208
That's where the action is

153
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:09,708
with cameras in the bedroom
so I don't miss a thing.

154
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,666
So, you film your guests?

155
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,000
I like to watch the movies later.

156
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:17,958
- Can I get anyone a drink?
- Tequila.

157
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:20,333
Tequila! Coming up.

158
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:22,083
So, what's your story?

159
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:24,958
Rory says you're the son
of the Egyptian president?

160
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:27,458
Son-in-law.

161
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:31,375
- You're married?
- Yes, I am. Six years.

162
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:33,541
- Kids?
- I have a little boy.

163
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:35,125
Such a waste.

164
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:36,625
Here we are.

165
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,250
For you.

166
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:40,208
- To swinging.
- To swinging.

167
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:41,291
Cheers.

168
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,416
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

169
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:28,875
I overslept.

170
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:31,666
Came back late last night.

171
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:42,833
Who were you with?

172
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:45,083
My friends at university.

173
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:48,625
What's this?

174
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:50,833
Your tuition bill.

175
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:00,291
I took care of it already.
No need to worry.

176
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:03,833
Mona...

177
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,916
is something wrong?

178
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:08,666
What is it?

179
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:13,958
Sami Sharaf came by and dropped this off.

180
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:25,916
You're gambling again?

181
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:30,291
Dancing with that blonde actress
Diana Ellis?

182
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:33,333
I won't be made to look foolish.

183
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:37,583
This is wrong.

184
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:40,041
He sends Sami to spy on me?

185
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:42,458
On the money, Ashraf, not you.

186
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:44,541
That's not the reason, and you know it.

187
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:45,541
Mama.

188
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:49,958
Oh, what's this? Hey, darling, come here.
Give Daddy a kiss.

189
00:15:58,541 --> 00:15:59,541
Go play.

190
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:05,833
- Listen, Mona--
- English, Ashraf.

191
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,333
Can't you see what's happening?

192
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,666
Sami is trying to discredit me
in the eyes of your father.

193
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:13,541
You're doing that all by yourself.

194
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:18,083
- He's demanding that we return to Egypt.
- What?

195
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:21,166
- What about my education?
- Your education?

196
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:25,375
Your education in poker?

197
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:26,583
In drinking?

198
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:30,208
You know I would do everything
to protect you,

199
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:32,291
but my father controls our money.

200
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:35,166
Ashraf...

201
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:37,833
he wants me to divorce you.

202
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:43,166
Divorce?

203
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:47,375
Is that what you want, Mona?

204
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:49,125
Huh?

205
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:51,291
No.

206
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:53,125
But this...

207
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,125
it needs to stop.

208
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:59,333
You know I love you,
but you can't lie to me.

209
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:05,291
I know.

210
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:44,333
Israeli Embassy,
how may I direct your call?

211
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:49,041
Michael Comay, Israeli Ambassador, please.

212
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:51,208
And to whom am I speaking?

213
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:54,416
I will identify myself to the Ambassador.

214
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:57,916
I'm afraid I am unable to connect you
without a name, sir.

215
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:03,041
Sir?

216
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:06,208
Sir? Are you still there?

217
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:13,708
- My name is Ashraf Marwan.
- How can I help you, Mr. Marwan?

218
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:16,791
I have information of interest
to the Intelligence Services,

219
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:18,833
so I must speak with the Ambassador.

220
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,958
I'm afraid he is not available.

221
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:24,375
But if you'd like to leave a--

222
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:35,125
Now, in its purest form,
potassium is a highly reactive metal.

223
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:38,541
For those who don't know
how to spell potassium,

224
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:40,500
write it down, remember it.

225
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:47,875
When exposed to water,
potassium creates a purple flame.

226
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:50,291
Why purple?

227
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:53,125
Anybody?

228
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:57,791
Excuse me.

229
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:01,791
I'm looking for Ashraf Marwan.

230
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:06,291
Ashraf Marwan.

231
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,291
Is there an Ashraf Marwan here?

232
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:20,291
Ashraf Mar...

233
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:23,625
Sir, please come down here.

234
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:50,333
Ashraf Marwan?

235
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,583
Yes?

236
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:55,208
Come with us.

237
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:58,333
I apologize.

238
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,875
President Nasser...

239
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:27,666
had a heart attack...

240
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:30,666
and died.

241
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:37,041
You and your family are requested
back to Cairo immediately.

242
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:42,916
He's dead?

243
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:44,625
Yes, Ashraf.

244
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:47,583
The President is dead.

245
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:02,000
Today, millions of Egyptians came
out on the streets...

246
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:05,541
to bid farewell
to President Gamal Abdel Nasser.

247
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:06,958
May he rest in peace.

248
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:11,708
And Vice President Anwar el Sadat
will be appointed

249
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:15,416
President of the Arab Republic of Egypt...

250
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:18,875
a few days
after the official period of mourning.

251
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:22,916
My condolences.

252
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:31,041
Mr. President...

253
00:22:35,125 --> 00:22:36,291
I'll be right back.

254
00:24:17,625 --> 00:24:19,875
Sami, Mrs. Nasser wants you urgently.

255
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:26,083
OK.

256
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:02,166
What is shameful
is denying reality.

257
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:06,958
The reality is that Israel captured
60,000 square kilometers

258
00:25:07,166 --> 00:25:09,458
of Egyptian land
because of the Six-Day War.

259
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,416
Israel occupies this land today.

260
00:25:14,875 --> 00:25:17,666
This administration's agenda
is to retake it,

261
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:21,833
so that our people can walk once again
with their heads held high.

262
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,708
Until then...

263
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:29,666
this map will remind us
of the task at hand.

264
00:25:29,833 --> 00:25:32,750
Our country is not ready for another war.

265
00:25:34,083 --> 00:25:37,125
That is why our only option
to recover the Sinai

266
00:25:37,208 --> 00:25:40,625
is to approach the American
about a diplomatic solution.

267
00:25:40,916 --> 00:25:42,041
Out of the question.

268
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:44,791
It would jeopardize
the support from the Soviets.

269
00:25:45,125 --> 00:25:46,000
Not necessarily.

270
00:25:46,708 --> 00:25:47,541
Anwar...

271
00:25:48,083 --> 00:25:49,291
what do you suggest?

272
00:25:50,291 --> 00:25:55,125
You will address me as "Mr. President",
Mr. Sami Sharaf.

273
00:25:59,583 --> 00:26:00,583
Mr. President...

274
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:04,791
I categorically refuse
to endorse this plan!

275
00:26:04,916 --> 00:26:08,500
It is for me to decide what is
in the best interest for Egypt!

276
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:11,250
Your job is to provide me
with the intelligence

277
00:26:11,333 --> 00:26:15,000
that will enable me to make that decision.

278
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:17,541
Nothing more.

279
00:26:18,583 --> 00:26:19,583
Am I clear?

280
00:26:20,958 --> 00:26:22,083
Yes, sir.

281
00:26:28,583 --> 00:26:29,625
Get out.

282
00:26:30,291 --> 00:26:31,291
Out!

283
00:26:31,833 --> 00:26:35,875
With the rise in criticism
of the diplomatic positions

284
00:26:35,958 --> 00:26:39,750
of the government towards Israel,
three ministers resigned today.

285
00:26:40,041 --> 00:26:44,916
This fuels speculations that they may be
preparing to launch a political challenge

286
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,666
against newly sworn-in President Sadat.

287
00:26:48,875 --> 00:26:49,875
Traitors.

288
00:27:00,583 --> 00:27:01,916
Come with me, Mr. Marwan.

289
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:06,458
Wait here, please.

290
00:27:14,541 --> 00:27:15,375
Mr. President,

291
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,291
Ashraf Marwan is here to see you.

292
00:27:17,375 --> 00:27:18,625
He says it's urgent.

293
00:27:20,083 --> 00:27:21,083
Let him in.

294
00:27:21,541 --> 00:27:22,958
- Turn it off.
- Yes.

295
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:42,166
What is it that could not wait
until Monday, Ashraf?

296
00:27:42,583 --> 00:27:45,916
Mr. President, I have records for you
of the upmost importance.

297
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,750
Records? What records?

298
00:27:48,791 --> 00:27:52,541
Records containing information
about Sami Sharaf, Gomaa and Sabri.

299
00:27:53,791 --> 00:27:56,916
Records detailing bribery
and corruption at the highest levels.

300
00:28:07,625 --> 00:28:11,000
With respect, they prove one should
not always keep one's enemies closer.

301
00:28:11,291 --> 00:28:13,166
But at least
they are in your possession...

302
00:28:14,166 --> 00:28:16,916
for you to do with as you see fit,
Mr. President.

303
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:30,625
How did you get them?

304
00:28:31,916 --> 00:28:35,916
- I was looking for something else.
- And what was that?

305
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:40,416
I won't lie, sir, money has been tight.

306
00:28:41,125 --> 00:28:43,833
I was looking
for financial paperwork for Mona.

307
00:28:44,708 --> 00:28:47,250
To see if there were
any funds we could get.

308
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:58,000
It's good that you came to me, Ashraf.

309
00:28:58,958 --> 00:29:00,916
This is a matter of the utmost importance.

310
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:04,125
I want to keep these.

311
00:29:05,166 --> 00:29:07,750
Please, Mr. President,
that's why I am here.

312
00:29:08,958 --> 00:29:10,583
When will you return to London?

313
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:15,458
It is important for Mona to be close
to her family at this difficult time.

314
00:29:18,041 --> 00:29:19,041
I see.

315
00:29:43,916 --> 00:29:45,708
Take your hands off!

316
00:29:45,791 --> 00:29:48,583
I am telling you to take your hands off!

317
00:29:48,666 --> 00:29:50,416
Answer me, who are you?

318
00:30:12,791 --> 00:30:13,666
Traitors!

319
00:30:53,791 --> 00:30:55,750
We are going to be late. Let him sleep.

320
00:30:55,916 --> 00:30:57,458
Samira, take care of him!

321
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:02,041
Come.

322
00:31:03,375 --> 00:31:06,875
To come back to London
with our son... look at us!

323
00:31:07,291 --> 00:31:09,166
There are better ways to spend our time

324
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:11,916
than by attending a boring reception
at the embassy.

325
00:31:12,125 --> 00:31:15,541
Ashraf, you have responsibilities,
and we have to go.

326
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:19,583
What will they do?
I'm part of the government now.

327
00:31:20,875 --> 00:31:25,125
You know, you working in a government
was the last thing I wanted.

328
00:31:25,833 --> 00:31:27,041
But to look at you now,

329
00:31:27,708 --> 00:31:29,750
I couldn't be more proud of my husband.

330
00:31:41,708 --> 00:31:42,541
Hello?

331
00:31:43,833 --> 00:31:45,833
- Ashraf Marwan?
- Yes, this is he.

332
00:31:46,583 --> 00:31:49,875
Ashraf Marwan, Director General
of President Sadat's office?

333
00:31:51,041 --> 00:31:52,000
How may I help you?

334
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,375
Israeli Embassy,
how may I direct your call?

335
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:01,000
Michael Comay,
Israeli Ambassador, please.

336
00:32:03,791 --> 00:32:05,333
My name is Ashraf Marwan.

337
00:32:06,416 --> 00:32:08,291
How can I help you, Mr. Marwan?

338
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:11,666
I have information of interest
to the Intelligence Services,

339
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:13,875
so I must speak with the ambassador.

340
00:32:16,375 --> 00:32:19,791
We are delighted
to accept your offer, Mr. Marwan.

341
00:32:20,125 --> 00:32:22,208
We apologize for our delay in responding.

342
00:32:23,291 --> 00:32:26,541
Tomorrow at 10 a.m., you'll be
at the lobby of the Balmoral Hotel,

343
00:32:26,625 --> 00:32:28,208
a short walk from your Embassy.

344
00:32:29,375 --> 00:32:30,750
Worry not, Mr. Marwan.

345
00:32:31,708 --> 00:32:33,708
Someone will approach you.

346
00:32:51,708 --> 00:32:53,000
Goal!

347
00:33:20,458 --> 00:33:22,208
- Hello.
- Have a good day, Secretary General.

348
00:33:23,916 --> 00:33:24,958
What's the score?

349
00:33:25,625 --> 00:33:26,833
Still 1:1.

350
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:28,166
Tough game.

351
00:33:29,375 --> 00:33:32,166
- With God's help, we will win.
- With God's will.

352
00:34:53,125 --> 00:34:56,416
Mr. Marwan? My name is Alex.
Pleasure to meet you.

353
00:34:56,833 --> 00:34:59,916
- Call me Ashraf, please.
- Sure. Come with me, please.

354
00:35:01,291 --> 00:35:03,125
- Where are we going?
- Somewhere safe.

355
00:35:15,416 --> 00:35:16,250
So...

356
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,125
Mr. Marwan...

357
00:35:19,333 --> 00:35:20,416
what are you doing here?

358
00:35:22,083 --> 00:35:25,083
- What do you mean?
- Why are you here? Why are you doing this?

359
00:35:29,708 --> 00:35:30,916
May I have one, please?

360
00:35:32,958 --> 00:35:34,708
Why are you doing this, Ashraf?

361
00:35:49,291 --> 00:35:51,291
- Am I being recorded?
- No.

362
00:35:52,166 --> 00:35:54,083
You didn't answer my question.

363
00:35:56,791 --> 00:35:59,000
- May we talk outside?
- We're staying here.

364
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:03,750
It's warm in here.

365
00:36:03,833 --> 00:36:05,125
I'll open a window.

366
00:36:07,458 --> 00:36:09,000
If you want to talk...

367
00:36:10,208 --> 00:36:11,458
we'll talk outside.

368
00:36:15,833 --> 00:36:18,125
You're not in a position to negotiate,
my friend.

369
00:36:19,791 --> 00:36:23,416
If you walk away, a recording will be
with the Egyptian press in minutes,

370
00:36:23,958 --> 00:36:25,583
and you don't want that, do you?

371
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:28,875
Father of Gamal.

372
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:31,916
Do you understand me?

373
00:36:33,083 --> 00:36:34,333
Do you understand?

374
00:36:35,666 --> 00:36:36,750
I do.

375
00:36:36,833 --> 00:36:39,166
I apologize, but I prefer to talk outside.

376
00:36:40,833 --> 00:36:41,916
You want to talk?

377
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,666
It's your choice.

378
00:36:44,791 --> 00:36:47,208
No one's going to pressure you
or threaten you.

379
00:36:48,208 --> 00:36:49,583
You want to talk on the patio...

380
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:51,958
that's where we talk.

381
00:36:52,333 --> 00:36:53,166
Please.

382
00:37:00,583 --> 00:37:02,333
This will establish my bona fides.

383
00:37:02,791 --> 00:37:04,583
On the table. We'll take it when we leave.

384
00:37:10,291 --> 00:37:15,041
I just hope we see something
that convinces us to see you again.

385
00:37:19,208 --> 00:37:21,791
You understand what I'm saying,
Ashraf?

386
00:37:40,166 --> 00:37:42,250
- Were you able to follow us?
- Of course.

387
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:45,916
You got both of them on camera?

388
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,500
If there's one thing I know about,
it's getting people on camera.

389
00:37:52,708 --> 00:37:53,833
Perfect. May I?

390
00:37:54,583 --> 00:37:56,291
You'll have to do better than that.

391
00:37:57,708 --> 00:37:59,333
What exactly do you want me to do?

392
00:37:59,416 --> 00:38:00,416
Who are they?

393
00:38:01,208 --> 00:38:02,208
It's work.

394
00:38:02,708 --> 00:38:05,791
- Nothing interesting.
- Well, interesting enough to photograph.

395
00:38:06,166 --> 00:38:07,833
I didn't just step off the bus.

396
00:38:09,958 --> 00:38:11,416
It's a corporate poker game.

397
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:14,750
I need to offer them something
to win their trust.

398
00:38:15,333 --> 00:38:17,666
Well, if that's true...

399
00:38:18,833 --> 00:38:19,958
I want a kiss.

400
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:26,375
Are you serious?

401
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:27,958
Deadly.

402
00:38:28,375 --> 00:38:29,250
Can you blame me?

403
00:38:30,583 --> 00:38:33,166
Espionage. It's just so exciting.

404
00:38:35,125 --> 00:38:36,250
Please.

405
00:38:50,333 --> 00:38:52,125
Thank you. I owe you.

406
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:53,958
Damn right you do.

407
00:38:56,833 --> 00:38:58,083
Where are you going?

408
00:38:58,625 --> 00:39:00,333
- Back to the hotel.
- I'll take you.

409
00:39:01,541 --> 00:39:02,833
That's not a good idea.

410
00:39:26,125 --> 00:39:27,958
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

411
00:39:30,458 --> 00:39:31,916
Yes.

412
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,875
- This is outstanding information.
- Granted.

413
00:39:40,458 --> 00:39:43,000
But there's something about him
I don't trust, Zvi.

414
00:39:43,916 --> 00:39:47,916
But the information he provided is solid,
and that's what we're all about.

415
00:39:48,875 --> 00:39:50,250
The pressure is on him.

416
00:39:50,333 --> 00:39:52,750
He doesn't provide
verifiable intelligence,

417
00:39:52,833 --> 00:39:54,166
we know he isn't for real.

418
00:39:54,916 --> 00:39:55,833
But you're right.

419
00:39:56,166 --> 00:40:00,416
Why did he make the phone call?
Why come to us in the first place?

420
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:03,833
It's personal. A pride issue.
He's greedy and needs the money.

421
00:40:04,291 --> 00:40:05,125
But, Zvi...

422
00:40:05,916 --> 00:40:07,541
I know when I'm being lied to.

423
00:40:07,625 --> 00:40:09,000
And Ashraf Marwan is not lying.

424
00:40:09,208 --> 00:40:10,083
Okay.

425
00:40:10,458 --> 00:40:13,875
If... if... Marwan is
who he says he is...

426
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:17,666
letting a rookie foreign agent
handle this asset is irresponsible!

427
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:20,166
Irresponsible?
You don't even trust him.

428
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:22,125
We don't want to start conceding power.

429
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:25,208
He wants to talk,
I can reel him in and run him properly.

430
00:40:25,291 --> 00:40:28,708
- No offense, I have more experience.
- We had a good first meeting.

431
00:40:28,875 --> 00:40:29,916
You want to blow it?

432
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,250
We have a really big fish on the line.
You have to trust me.

433
00:40:33,333 --> 00:40:34,375
Gentlemen...

434
00:40:35,958 --> 00:40:39,500
these are stormy waters,
I don't want to rock the boat.

435
00:40:40,666 --> 00:40:43,208
- Danny will handle the asset.
- Thank you, sir.

436
00:40:43,291 --> 00:40:45,833
But at the first problem,
I'll remove you from the picture.

437
00:40:46,041 --> 00:40:46,875
As you should.

438
00:40:46,958 --> 00:40:49,958
I want his every move watched in London.

439
00:40:50,125 --> 00:40:54,125
Until we know he's genuine,
I won't take any chances.

440
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,666
- Understood.
- Thank you.

441
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
There's Ashraf.

442
00:41:15,916 --> 00:41:18,083
Great, he went inside.
Go tell Danny.

443
00:41:47,375 --> 00:41:50,958
- Anything to drink, sir?
- Scotch on the rocks, please.

444
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,041
So...

445
00:41:56,833 --> 00:41:58,375
This is how you develop trust.

446
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,083
I thought you'd appreciate the irony.

447
00:42:02,166 --> 00:42:04,333
They don't allow Arabs or Jews in here.

448
00:42:07,333 --> 00:42:08,708
So, what do you have for me?

449
00:42:11,416 --> 00:42:12,791
It's in my coat pocket.

450
00:42:14,125 --> 00:42:17,166
I thought we could swap tokens
and carry each other's coats.

451
00:42:19,541 --> 00:42:20,541
It won't work.

452
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:22,291
Why?

453
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,708
Because I like my coat.

454
00:42:27,208 --> 00:42:29,708
Listen, why don't you give me
your ticket and...

455
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,750
hope the weather takes a warm turn?

456
00:42:36,333 --> 00:42:37,333
Thank you.

457
00:42:42,666 --> 00:42:44,875
Have your associates
come up with a proposal?

458
00:42:47,541 --> 00:42:50,083
I have 20,000 right here.

459
00:43:00,166 --> 00:43:03,750
- How does it feel?
- It's not as thick as I was expecting.

460
00:43:04,708 --> 00:43:06,458
The more you tell us, the thicker it gets.

461
00:43:19,083 --> 00:43:20,083
Thank you.

462
00:43:20,958 --> 00:43:22,041
Just one more thing.

463
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:25,708
We need to arrange contingency
in case of emergency.

464
00:43:26,291 --> 00:43:28,500
When contact cannot be so...

465
00:43:30,166 --> 00:43:31,291
so convivial.

466
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:33,916
You're talking about war?

467
00:43:36,833 --> 00:43:38,583
In the event of such a threat...

468
00:43:41,083 --> 00:43:42,333
there will be a call.

469
00:43:43,333 --> 00:43:47,166
- I'll talk about a delivery of chemicals.
- And if the threat is imminent?

470
00:43:52,166 --> 00:43:54,500
I will use the word "potassium".

471
00:43:58,125 --> 00:43:59,208
Does that suit?

472
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:05,125
Sahetak, habibi!

473
00:44:06,833 --> 00:44:08,416
Sahetak.

474
00:44:48,208 --> 00:44:49,583
You have ten minutes.

475
00:44:53,541 --> 00:44:54,375
Sharaf.

476
00:44:55,291 --> 00:44:56,166
Babak.

477
00:45:03,083 --> 00:45:04,166
You look good.

478
00:45:06,041 --> 00:45:07,125
How are you?

479
00:45:09,541 --> 00:45:11,625
- Tea?
- No, thank you.

480
00:45:12,875 --> 00:45:13,833
Sit.

481
00:45:26,583 --> 00:45:29,125
These men in London
are loyal to me.

482
00:45:35,583 --> 00:45:37,541
If you need more assistance,

483
00:45:38,208 --> 00:45:40,500
the Syrian operatives will help us.

484
00:45:41,666 --> 00:45:42,500
Thank you.

485
00:45:53,583 --> 00:45:54,583
Stop here.

486
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
From now on...

487
00:47:02,291 --> 00:47:03,583
you're known as "The Angel".

488
00:47:04,583 --> 00:47:06,041
It's the name I got approved.

489
00:47:07,083 --> 00:47:08,375
"The Angel."

490
00:47:09,791 --> 00:47:10,750
I like it.

491
00:47:13,666 --> 00:47:14,583
What's this?

492
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:17,916
Happy birthday, Alex.

493
00:47:22,458 --> 00:47:23,708
Or do you prefer Danny?

494
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:32,000
Ali Hassan Salameh. He coordinated
the attacks at the Munich Olympics.

495
00:47:32,083 --> 00:47:33,041
I know who he is.

496
00:47:33,416 --> 00:47:35,750
And we all know Israel's looking for him.

497
00:47:35,833 --> 00:47:37,625
- Here he is.
- Where did you get this?

498
00:47:37,708 --> 00:47:40,500
Same people that gave me
your real name. Verify it.

499
00:47:43,375 --> 00:47:47,875
- You and I, we have nothing without trust.
- Absolutely.

500
00:47:47,958 --> 00:47:50,000
And trust is a two-way street, Danny.

501
00:47:50,291 --> 00:47:51,458
Stop using that name.

502
00:47:51,541 --> 00:47:54,458
How can I trust you
with information like this

503
00:47:54,541 --> 00:47:56,875
if you won't you trust me
without a babysitter?

504
00:47:57,083 --> 00:47:58,291
- So, this is a test?
- No.

505
00:47:58,625 --> 00:47:59,541
Alex...

506
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
I'm betting on you.

507
00:48:02,375 --> 00:48:03,208
All in.

508
00:48:24,333 --> 00:48:25,333
Drive.

509
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Hey...

510
00:48:55,083 --> 00:48:56,500
"There was once...

511
00:48:58,791 --> 00:49:01,041
There was once a young shepherd boy...

512
00:49:06,125 --> 00:49:08,458
who tended his sheep...

513
00:49:09,708 --> 00:49:11,208
at the foot of a mountain...

514
00:49:12,666 --> 00:49:14,125
near a dark forest.

515
00:49:15,875 --> 00:49:16,708
At one time...

516
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:21,875
the boy rushed down the hill
towards the village...

517
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,500
calling...

518
00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:27,791
'Wolf!' 'Wolf!'

519
00:49:35,833 --> 00:49:38,916
Until all of the villagers
rushed out to meet him.

520
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:41,958
And on the third day...

521
00:49:42,958 --> 00:49:44,583
the boy looked and saw...

522
00:49:46,125 --> 00:49:47,583
guess what?

523
00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:50,083
A wolf!

524
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:54,458
But this time,
when he cried 'Wolf!'...

525
00:49:55,958 --> 00:49:58,791
the villagers,
who had been fooled twice before...

526
00:49:59,708 --> 00:50:01,166
did not believe him

527
00:50:02,291 --> 00:50:04,250
and did not come to his aid.

528
00:50:05,958 --> 00:50:06,958
And the boy...

529
00:50:09,375 --> 00:50:10,541
And the boy...

530
00:50:12,791 --> 00:50:14,000
shouted...

531
00:50:16,541 --> 00:50:17,500
'Wolf!'

532
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:20,666
'Wolf!"'

533
00:51:03,416 --> 00:51:06,000
Our men will cross the Suez Canal here...

534
00:51:07,250 --> 00:51:08,208
and here.

535
00:51:08,916 --> 00:51:10,833
We created two-meter trenches

536
00:51:10,916 --> 00:51:13,416
to conceal our operation
from the Israeli soldiers.

537
00:51:13,875 --> 00:51:18,041
Inside are the anti-aircraft missiles
that arrived last month from Russia.

538
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,333
The Israelis have no idea.

539
00:51:22,375 --> 00:51:24,416
How can you be sure, General Shazly?

540
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:27,333
Because from the air,

541
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:30,916
they look
like normal Russian anti-tank defenses.

542
00:51:31,291 --> 00:51:34,750
We'll attack the Israelis
with all of our mighty renewed forces.

543
00:51:35,458 --> 00:51:38,416
The Israeli line of defense
will not expect such an attack,

544
00:51:38,625 --> 00:51:40,125
nor will they be prepared for it.

545
00:51:40,708 --> 00:51:42,458
What will the H-Hour be?

546
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,250
We will attack a week from today,

547
00:51:45,625 --> 00:51:47,666
with the sun behind us
and directly in their eyes.

548
00:51:48,375 --> 00:51:50,083
They won't even see us coming.

549
00:51:51,333 --> 00:51:53,041
Thank you, General Shazly.

550
00:51:53,333 --> 00:51:55,833
Let's continue this briefing
same time tomorrow morning.

551
00:51:56,625 --> 00:51:57,958
That will be all, gentlemen.

552
00:52:03,125 --> 00:52:06,166
I beg you, Mr. President,
please don't do this. Not now.

553
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:11,250
I've exhausted all diplomatic solutions,
Ashraf, you know that.

554
00:52:11,916 --> 00:52:16,250
Recovering the land taken from us
is essential if I am to remain in office.

555
00:52:17,041 --> 00:52:18,708
If we fail, there will be a coup.

556
00:52:20,291 --> 00:52:23,333
Can you imagine
how terrible a coup would be?

557
00:52:24,458 --> 00:52:26,875
Sometimes, peace must be fought for.

558
00:52:33,916 --> 00:52:38,541
In four days, Egypt will cross
the Suez Canal into the Sinai at sunset.

559
00:52:40,125 --> 00:52:41,250
Are you sure?

560
00:52:42,458 --> 00:52:44,833
I travel back to Cairo
on Saturday morning.

561
00:52:45,208 --> 00:52:48,458
If there's any change,
I'll be here at 7 p.m. on Friday.

562
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:52,750
And if there isn't?

563
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,583
Then it's war, my friend.

564
00:53:17,583 --> 00:53:20,791
The Angel sent an invoice
for imminent shipment of chemicals.

565
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,833
Urgent consideration required.

566
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:27,916
Once again,
tensions are mounting in the Middle East,

567
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:31,750
with an escalation of troop activity
on the Israeli-Egyptian border.

568
00:53:32,458 --> 00:53:36,125
Israel has placed the country
on high alert and called up the reserves.

569
00:53:36,833 --> 00:53:38,375
Meanwhile, across the border,

570
00:53:38,458 --> 00:53:42,583
Egypt's response has been to mobilize
its military on the banks of the Suez.

571
00:53:43,041 --> 00:53:45,833
With thousands of soldiers
from both armies amassing,

572
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,125
the fear remains
that war could break out at any time.

573
00:54:00,875 --> 00:54:01,958
Deal gentlemen.

574
00:54:05,458 --> 00:54:07,541
Raise by 1...

575
00:54:16,166 --> 00:54:17,416
Here's your whiskey.

576
00:54:31,333 --> 00:54:32,333
Chips.

577
00:54:32,416 --> 00:54:33,416
All in.

578
00:54:53,583 --> 00:54:54,666
Ashraf...

579
00:54:59,333 --> 00:55:00,500
Are you okay?

580
00:55:01,208 --> 00:55:04,000
- We have a flight to catch.
- I am very tired.

581
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:14,750
You have a fever, darling.

582
00:55:28,791 --> 00:55:30,125
Where are you going?

583
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:32,583
I'll be back.

584
00:56:31,875 --> 00:56:34,583
Come on, Ashraf, showtime.

585
00:56:52,458 --> 00:56:53,458
Take these.

586
00:56:55,375 --> 00:56:56,541
You'll feel better.

587
00:57:03,541 --> 00:57:04,541
Thank you.

588
00:57:07,708 --> 00:57:08,916
I love you.

589
00:57:09,291 --> 00:57:10,458
I'll report.

590
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:18,750
That was Golda.

591
00:57:21,083 --> 00:57:24,791
She wanted to remind us
of the gravity of the situation.

592
00:57:26,833 --> 00:57:30,125
We are talking about tens
of thousands of men mobilized

593
00:57:30,208 --> 00:57:31,708
on information from our source.

594
00:57:31,875 --> 00:57:34,750
- Sir--
- Not to mention the 8% reserves.

595
00:57:35,125 --> 00:57:38,458
Shopkeepers, lawyers and doctors
that cost the Israeli economy

596
00:57:38,541 --> 00:57:40,625
millions of dollars at every false alarm.

597
00:57:40,791 --> 00:57:42,916
Sir, you didn't see him. He was certain.

598
00:57:43,041 --> 00:57:44,541
Maybe it's an internal problem.

599
00:57:44,708 --> 00:57:46,250
Maybe Sadat got cold feet.

600
00:57:46,333 --> 00:57:49,791
You need to learn to handle your asset
before he becomes a liability.

601
00:57:50,708 --> 00:57:52,875
Sir, he has always given us incredible--

602
00:57:52,958 --> 00:57:53,958
Enough!

603
00:57:55,875 --> 00:57:58,166
A good agent is only ever in the moment.

604
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:02,041
If you have stars in your eyes,
you are of no use to me, clear?

605
00:58:03,708 --> 00:58:04,583
Yes, sir.

606
00:58:10,041 --> 00:58:11,291
Good morning.

607
00:58:12,541 --> 00:58:13,666
Good morning.

608
00:58:14,541 --> 00:58:15,750
These are for the safe.

609
00:58:16,583 --> 00:58:18,208
Are you good, Ashraf?

610
00:58:18,916 --> 00:58:21,041
I haven't seen you around lately...

611
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:26,708
You look like
you haven't slept in a decade.

612
00:58:28,041 --> 00:58:29,666
I'm fine, Mr. President.

613
00:58:29,875 --> 00:58:32,666
Good, I have a matter of my own
to discuss with you.

614
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,250
- In private, please.
- Excuse me, sir.

615
00:58:39,083 --> 00:58:43,833
Since you are very well acquainted
with high-ranking diplomats in Libya...

616
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,541
I want you to meet with Colonel Gaddafi.

617
00:58:48,375 --> 00:58:49,375
Gaddafi is unstable,

618
00:58:50,416 --> 00:58:53,083
but you're good
at managing unstable personalities.

619
00:58:54,375 --> 00:58:58,000
Charm and convince him
to let us tap his oil reserves.

620
00:58:59,833 --> 00:59:01,958
What does one offer
to charm a man like that?

621
00:59:02,041 --> 00:59:03,500
I'm sure you can find something.

622
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:06,416
Bring this home for us,

623
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:09,708
and I'll make you
Liaison for Special Affairs.

624
00:59:11,166 --> 00:59:14,875
You will act as my personal emissary
to all the leaders of the Arab World.

625
00:59:17,250 --> 00:59:19,875
How does that sound, Ashraf?

626
00:59:21,708 --> 00:59:23,916
Like a great plan, Mr. President.

627
00:59:59,958 --> 01:00:02,083
It's amazing what you've built.

628
01:00:03,166 --> 01:00:05,083
For the son of a Bedouin goat herder?

629
01:00:06,791 --> 01:00:07,791
I intended no offense.

630
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:10,458
And none was taken.

631
01:00:11,791 --> 01:00:12,750
Ashraf...

632
01:00:12,958 --> 01:00:14,125
This will surprise you...

633
01:00:14,208 --> 01:00:15,583
I'm writing a book.

634
01:00:15,666 --> 01:00:16,791
The Green Book.

635
01:00:17,708 --> 01:00:18,583
The Green Book?

636
01:00:18,666 --> 01:00:21,791
It is a guide to the emancipation
of men, a new gospel.

637
01:00:22,541 --> 01:00:24,250
The Western Bible states:

638
01:00:24,333 --> 01:00:27,500
"In the beginning was the Word
and the Word was God."

639
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:31,500
The Green Book will be
the new word for a new era.

640
01:00:31,583 --> 01:00:32,750
My word.

641
01:00:33,541 --> 01:00:34,833
It will help you govern?

642
01:00:36,208 --> 01:00:37,916
Along with power and fear.

643
01:00:38,541 --> 01:00:39,750
Without those,

644
01:00:39,833 --> 01:00:42,875
the Arab people will go to the streets
and destroy themselves.

645
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,208
You mark my words.

646
01:00:44,916 --> 01:00:47,333
Civil war will rage
across the Middle East,

647
01:00:47,541 --> 01:00:49,458
chaos and destruction will reign.

648
01:00:50,708 --> 01:00:51,833
I'm a realist.

649
01:00:52,541 --> 01:00:54,458
My enemies are not going anywhere.

650
01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:56,875
There will always be a threat to my life.

651
01:00:58,750 --> 01:01:01,583
You speak of enemies?
Perhaps I can help with that.

652
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:11,583
A gesture, from a friend.

653
01:01:20,333 --> 01:01:21,750
You see?

654
01:01:22,708 --> 01:01:23,833
Divine intervention!

655
01:01:25,625 --> 01:01:28,083
You can tell Sadat I agree to his request.

656
01:01:29,916 --> 01:01:30,750
But...

657
01:01:31,041 --> 01:01:34,000
if he makes a deal
with the American devil and the Zionists,

658
01:01:34,458 --> 01:01:36,208
I will charge him double on the oil.

659
01:01:37,625 --> 01:01:38,916
Only double?

660
01:01:41,708 --> 01:01:43,833
You are right, triple!

661
01:01:45,833 --> 01:01:48,083
I think it's time
for me to leave, Colonel.

662
01:01:48,166 --> 01:01:49,166
Nonsense!

663
01:01:50,083 --> 01:01:51,833
We must break bread together.

664
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:54,958
And you must spend some time
with our Libyan girls.

665
01:01:56,708 --> 01:01:57,958
What do you think?

666
01:01:59,416 --> 01:02:02,125
I appreciate that, I really do...

667
01:02:02,708 --> 01:02:04,708
but I'm a married man.

668
01:02:05,250 --> 01:02:07,541
All the more reason why you deserve it.

669
01:02:09,333 --> 01:02:12,125
You are a good man, a loyal man.

670
01:02:12,916 --> 01:02:15,000
But if you don't want
to taste the goat's milk,

671
01:02:15,708 --> 01:02:18,416
the least you can do is stay

672
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,375
and watch the farmer in action.

673
01:02:21,708 --> 01:02:22,666
I insist.

674
01:02:43,041 --> 01:02:44,041
Mona?

675
01:02:44,791 --> 01:02:48,458
I have something for you and Gamal.

676
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:50,416
Quiet, Gamal is sleeping.

677
01:02:54,625 --> 01:02:58,833
I love you, Mona.

678
01:03:00,583 --> 01:03:01,666
Thank you.

679
01:03:05,083 --> 01:03:06,125
What's wrong?

680
01:03:07,041 --> 01:03:08,416
Where were you, today?

681
01:03:09,041 --> 01:03:12,333
You flew in early.
Your office said you were unreachable.

682
01:03:13,208 --> 01:03:14,333
I had a meeting.

683
01:03:15,416 --> 01:03:16,583
With Diana Ellis?

684
01:03:19,958 --> 01:03:20,791
What?

685
01:03:21,166 --> 01:03:23,625
If I were a man,
I'd be happy to have her as a mistress.

686
01:03:24,208 --> 01:03:26,416
She's no threat to you or to us.

687
01:03:27,208 --> 01:03:28,041
Then who is?

688
01:03:28,708 --> 01:03:30,000
No one is.

689
01:03:30,083 --> 01:03:32,458
You are always disappearing
at odd moments.

690
01:03:32,875 --> 01:03:35,166
Emergency trips to Rome or Paris.

691
01:03:35,833 --> 01:03:37,458
Do you think I'm blind, Ashraf?

692
01:03:38,166 --> 01:03:39,083
Stupid?

693
01:03:39,708 --> 01:03:41,791
- No.
- Well, I am.

694
01:03:42,208 --> 01:03:43,708
- I must be.
- Mona...

695
01:03:47,458 --> 01:03:50,833
There is no other woman,
there never has been and never will be.

696
01:03:50,916 --> 01:03:53,458
Please let's not do this. Please.

697
01:03:54,458 --> 01:03:56,583
Then what aren't you telling me?

698
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:00,583
It's a matter of state security.
I'm sorry, I can't say more.

699
01:04:01,166 --> 01:04:02,208
Please.

700
01:04:02,291 --> 01:04:06,125
The life you have now,
that was your wish, Ashraf, not mine.

701
01:04:06,833 --> 01:04:08,750
I'm a strong woman, Ashraf,

702
01:04:09,416 --> 01:04:10,666
but I have my limits.

703
01:04:14,625 --> 01:04:18,458
I picked him up
as he left the Israeli Embassy.

704
01:04:19,208 --> 01:04:20,125
He's known as Alex.

705
01:04:22,916 --> 01:04:23,833
Maybe...

706
01:04:25,666 --> 01:04:27,333
he is a simple clerk.

707
01:04:28,583 --> 01:04:29,875
No, he's Mossad.

708
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,625
He was waiting for Ashraf, I know it.

709
01:04:43,416 --> 01:04:45,458
The son-in-law of the great Nasser...

710
01:04:47,708 --> 01:04:49,791
working for the Israelis?

711
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:56,583
That's a wild assumption, Babak.

712
01:04:58,416 --> 01:05:00,625
We need proof of this.

713
01:05:05,708 --> 01:05:08,541
I have your men watching
every move he makes.

714
01:05:15,833 --> 01:05:17,333
Where is Ashraf now?

715
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,125
He is back in London.

716
01:05:21,833 --> 01:05:23,000
Taxi, please.

717
01:05:25,250 --> 01:05:26,833
Corner grove, north London.

718
01:05:42,250 --> 01:05:43,583
Faster, please, faster!

719
01:06:08,416 --> 01:06:09,791
Thank you, keep the change.

720
01:07:20,333 --> 01:07:22,458
- Danny, stop it, please!
- You lied!

721
01:07:22,583 --> 01:07:25,666
- I didn't realize--
- There was no war, it was a false alarm!

722
01:07:39,791 --> 01:07:41,166
It's a cigarette.

723
01:07:45,625 --> 01:07:46,958
Remember what I've said.

724
01:07:48,166 --> 01:07:50,208
This all falls apart without trust.

725
01:07:50,375 --> 01:07:52,875
Trust? You are fucking kidding me.

726
01:07:53,375 --> 01:07:56,750
You played us, you know you did.
I didn't see it, that's on me.

727
01:07:57,208 --> 01:08:00,666
This is what you were doing
when you first called the Israeli Embassy.

728
01:08:00,750 --> 01:08:03,833
- Is this your goal? To fuck with Israel?
- No...

729
01:08:04,875 --> 01:08:06,833
Then why? Why do you do it?

730
01:08:10,208 --> 01:08:11,958
You want another war, Alex?

731
01:08:13,125 --> 01:08:14,083
Huh?

732
01:08:15,291 --> 01:08:16,291
Tell me.

733
01:08:17,708 --> 01:08:18,708
Because I don't.

734
01:08:31,041 --> 01:08:34,250
Everything I told you,
I told you in good faith.

735
01:08:35,458 --> 01:08:37,416
Getting moral on me? That's not like you.

736
01:08:38,166 --> 01:08:39,166
Give me that.

737
01:08:40,458 --> 01:08:42,875
Why, because I sold out
my country for money?

738
01:08:44,166 --> 01:08:45,958
No, because you're a fucking liar.

739
01:08:54,250 --> 01:08:55,208
What is this?

740
01:08:55,708 --> 01:08:59,125
Detailed battle plans
for Egypt's invasion into the Sinai.

741
01:09:00,166 --> 01:09:02,458
- Again, Ashraf!
- Alex, please.

742
01:09:03,291 --> 01:09:06,250
I was given these plans
by General Shazly himself,

743
01:09:06,333 --> 01:09:08,583
after our last meeting
with President Sadat.

744
01:09:09,583 --> 01:09:11,500
Believe me or don't use it or don't...

745
01:09:11,583 --> 01:09:14,291
It's your call, I don't care,
but you don't have much time.

746
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Mr. President...

747
01:09:20,833 --> 01:09:23,375
I don't understand
why you changed your mind.

748
01:09:23,875 --> 01:09:27,583
General, my mind has not changed,
it's simply not the right timing.

749
01:09:28,625 --> 01:09:33,625
- I had a gut feeling that we should wait.
- Why, Mr. President? The army is ready.

750
01:09:33,833 --> 01:09:35,708
We should move forward
with the original plan.

751
01:09:36,166 --> 01:09:37,791
That'll be all, General.

752
01:09:41,125 --> 01:09:44,125
- Get Ashraf back to Cairo.
- Yes, Mr. President.

753
01:10:09,583 --> 01:10:12,583
That was the weather news

754
01:10:13,041 --> 01:10:15,541
and now the latest news.

755
01:10:16,041 --> 01:10:19,250
Israel has increased
the readiness of its reserve army.

756
01:10:19,916 --> 01:10:23,291
The act of aggression was condemned
by the United Arab League

757
01:10:23,375 --> 01:10:24,541
considering that...

758
01:11:02,250 --> 01:11:04,500
General Shazly
has announced the completion

759
01:11:04,583 --> 01:11:07,291
of the largest army exercise
in recent Egyptian history.

760
01:11:07,375 --> 01:11:09,041
UPROAR IN ISRAEL OVER MOBILIZATION

761
01:11:09,125 --> 01:11:13,083
Israel has pulled back its forces...

762
01:11:16,125 --> 01:11:17,666
How's the family, Ashraf?

763
01:11:20,291 --> 01:11:21,750
They are well, Mr. President.

764
01:11:24,750 --> 01:11:27,750
Apologies for interrupting
but there is something urgent.

765
01:11:28,791 --> 01:11:30,625
- Go on.
- Someone called twice.

766
01:11:30,916 --> 01:11:32,250
Asking for you, Mr. Marwan.

767
01:11:34,416 --> 01:11:35,250
Who was it?

768
01:11:35,333 --> 01:11:38,541
He didn't say. Something
about chemicals that weren't delivered.

769
01:11:41,916 --> 01:11:43,000
What exactly did he say?

770
01:11:43,416 --> 01:11:46,708
That it was imperative you contact him
but didn't leave a number.

771
01:11:49,041 --> 01:11:52,125
I have no idea what that's about.
Thank you.

772
01:11:52,208 --> 01:11:53,208
Excuse me, sir.

773
01:11:58,166 --> 01:12:01,208
What business do you have
with the delivery of chemicals?

774
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:04,375
I don't know, Your Excellency.
Maybe they have the wrong number.

775
01:12:08,625 --> 01:12:09,541
Fine.

776
01:12:12,458 --> 01:12:14,541
- OK, here you go.
- Thank you, Mr. President.

777
01:12:45,708 --> 01:12:46,875
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry.

778
01:12:48,875 --> 01:12:49,958
From Alex.

779
01:13:30,458 --> 01:13:31,583
Thank you.

780
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,625
Mr. Marwan, we need a moment of your time.

781
01:14:25,375 --> 01:14:28,083
- What for?
- In the car, please.

782
01:14:30,125 --> 01:14:31,041
Let's go.

783
01:14:53,833 --> 01:14:55,208
Please! Please!

784
01:15:01,166 --> 01:15:03,416
- Tell Judah we are coming.
- OK, Gideon.

785
01:15:03,625 --> 01:15:05,208
Start. Start. Start.

786
01:15:36,708 --> 01:15:38,583
- Where is he?
- In the trunk.

787
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:48,333
Good morning, father of Gamal.

788
01:15:50,791 --> 01:15:51,791
Take him out.

789
01:15:51,875 --> 01:15:52,875
Get out.

790
01:16:01,083 --> 01:16:02,083
Where am I?

791
01:16:04,291 --> 01:16:05,333
You remember me?

792
01:16:07,750 --> 01:16:08,916
Yes, I remember you.

793
01:16:18,666 --> 01:16:19,750
What do you want?

794
01:16:24,375 --> 01:16:26,583
Let's start again. Call me Elliot.

795
01:16:29,208 --> 01:16:30,291
Where is Alex?

796
01:16:31,250 --> 01:16:32,458
Forget about Alex.

797
01:16:32,916 --> 01:16:36,666
We've paid you well for information
that has twice turned out to be false.

798
01:16:36,750 --> 01:16:39,916
We wasted a lot of energy
and money acting on that information.

799
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,583
The attack plans were not false.

800
01:16:43,333 --> 01:16:45,791
I can't help it
that Sadat keeps changing his mind.

801
01:16:45,875 --> 01:16:48,958
The man is unpredictable.
Do you understand that?

802
01:16:56,208 --> 01:16:57,958
You have a beautiful family, Ashraf.

803
01:17:01,291 --> 01:17:03,291
They must be a great comfort to you.

804
01:17:08,041 --> 01:17:10,041
Where is Alex? Does he know about this?

805
01:17:10,291 --> 01:17:12,083
No one can protect you if you lie to us.

806
01:17:13,750 --> 01:17:14,791
What do you want?

807
01:17:14,958 --> 01:17:18,375
Is Egypt going to launch
a war against Israel?

808
01:17:18,958 --> 01:17:23,000
Of course, there's going to be a war.
Of course, Sadat is going to attack.

809
01:17:23,083 --> 01:17:24,958
He's backed in a corner!

810
01:17:26,916 --> 01:17:30,458
He kicks out the Soviets
and the US backs out of the deal,

811
01:17:30,541 --> 01:17:33,500
he's left with no choice except war!

812
01:17:33,583 --> 01:17:34,791
You want...

813
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:46,666
You want to save Israel?

814
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:49,500
Huh?

815
01:17:49,875 --> 01:17:52,416
You want to save the lives
of your soldiers?

816
01:17:54,166 --> 01:17:57,625
Enter into talks to give back the Sinai!

817
01:18:04,875 --> 01:18:06,000
You want to shoot?

818
01:18:08,583 --> 01:18:09,500
Shoot.

819
01:18:12,041 --> 01:18:13,041
Shoot.

820
01:18:16,291 --> 01:18:17,416
I don't care, shoot.

821
01:18:17,666 --> 01:18:18,666
Shoot.

822
01:18:22,541 --> 01:18:23,541
Leave him.

823
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:26,916
Let him get back alone.

824
01:18:58,041 --> 01:18:59,166
Come to Mommy.

825
01:19:03,875 --> 01:19:05,291
Don't make a sound!

826
01:19:05,375 --> 01:19:07,375
- Take the kid away.
- Gamal!

827
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:09,416
- Gamal! Gamal!
- Mama, mama!

828
01:19:14,666 --> 01:19:15,500
Sit.

829
01:19:16,875 --> 01:19:19,000
- Did you find anything?
- Nothing.

830
01:19:19,083 --> 01:19:20,750
- You searched well?
- Yes.

831
01:19:23,666 --> 01:19:25,041
Where is the safe?

832
01:19:26,083 --> 01:19:27,541
We don't have a safe.

833
01:19:28,083 --> 01:19:29,750
We don't have a lot of time to waste.

834
01:19:29,916 --> 01:19:32,000
I asked where is the safe?

835
01:19:32,208 --> 01:19:34,375
I said we don't have a safe.

836
01:19:34,458 --> 01:19:36,291
Where is the safe?

837
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:38,250
I swear to you! We don't have a safe.

838
01:19:38,666 --> 01:19:40,750
You'll talk! I will make you talk.

839
01:19:42,666 --> 01:19:45,791
- Where is my son?
- Sit down. Your son is fine. Sit down!

840
01:19:45,875 --> 01:19:47,250
I said sit down!

841
01:19:47,333 --> 01:19:48,375
Sit down!

842
01:19:52,208 --> 01:19:53,208
Listen.

843
01:19:55,166 --> 01:19:58,000
If you report what happened here...

844
01:19:59,625 --> 01:20:03,041
we will be back,
and we will kill you, one by one.

845
01:20:04,375 --> 01:20:06,416
One by one.

846
01:20:07,458 --> 01:20:08,583
Count to 100.

847
01:20:10,916 --> 01:20:11,875
Count.

848
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,000
Count!

849
01:20:15,083 --> 01:20:16,166
One...

850
01:20:17,333 --> 01:20:18,333
two...

851
01:20:19,375 --> 01:20:20,375
three...

852
01:20:21,583 --> 01:20:23,083
- Let's go.
- ...four...

853
01:20:24,125 --> 01:20:25,125
five...

854
01:20:26,375 --> 01:20:27,583
six...

855
01:20:28,750 --> 01:20:29,750
seven...

856
01:20:30,333 --> 01:20:31,458
eight...

857
01:20:32,458 --> 01:20:33,791
nine... Gamal!

858
01:20:35,375 --> 01:20:36,375
Mrs. Mona...

859
01:20:38,125 --> 01:20:39,250
Gamal...

860
01:20:40,416 --> 01:20:42,375
- Mom!
- My love...

861
01:20:43,666 --> 01:20:44,958
Don't be afraid.

862
01:20:47,750 --> 01:20:48,750
I'm sorry...

863
01:20:50,916 --> 01:20:51,833
Hello?

864
01:20:54,375 --> 01:20:55,375
Mona?

865
01:20:56,708 --> 01:20:58,500
Mona, Mona, Mona, hey...

866
01:21:06,958 --> 01:21:08,333
Smile to me.

867
01:21:08,416 --> 01:21:10,291
- Danny, smile!
- I'm smiling.

868
01:21:10,416 --> 01:21:12,375
Are you laughing at me angel?

869
01:21:18,750 --> 01:21:19,583
She's beautiful.

870
01:21:21,291 --> 01:21:22,416
- Thank you.
- Hey!

871
01:21:22,791 --> 01:21:24,500
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

872
01:21:24,583 --> 01:21:26,500
- Who is it, honey?
- An old friend.

873
01:21:27,416 --> 01:21:28,458
Ashraf.

874
01:21:29,291 --> 01:21:31,583
- She must be a great comfort to you.
- She is.

875
01:21:31,666 --> 01:21:33,041
- Nice to meet you.
- And you.

876
01:21:33,125 --> 01:21:34,250
- Bye, sweetheart.
- Ashraf!

877
01:21:34,333 --> 01:21:35,833
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

878
01:21:39,583 --> 01:21:41,916
- What are you doing here?
- I was threatened.

879
01:21:42,250 --> 01:21:43,083
Where were you?

880
01:21:45,333 --> 01:21:48,416
Never ever approach me
when I'm with my family.

881
01:21:48,583 --> 01:21:50,333
Oh, but my family is fair game?

882
01:21:52,333 --> 01:21:54,458
You think Mossad is one big happy family?

883
01:21:55,291 --> 01:21:58,875
There are factions within factions,
and they all have their own opinion.

884
01:21:59,333 --> 01:22:00,750
I can't control you, Ashraf.

885
01:22:00,875 --> 01:22:03,875
I can't control your lies
or their outcome, so I'm out.

886
01:22:04,916 --> 01:22:06,125
You fucked up, Ashraf.

887
01:22:06,416 --> 01:22:09,375
You fuck up. I can't protect you
from people who get mad at you.

888
01:22:09,708 --> 01:22:12,166
- You can speak to them.
- It doesn't work that way.

889
01:22:12,375 --> 01:22:15,375
You have to do something bigger
to win back their trust.

890
01:22:15,708 --> 01:22:17,916
Their trust? Or yours?

891
01:22:18,458 --> 01:22:19,583
It's all the same.

892
01:22:20,208 --> 01:22:21,333
It's good to see you.

893
01:22:46,791 --> 01:22:49,166
Gamal, take care
of your mother for me.

894
01:22:49,291 --> 01:22:50,375
OK, my love?

895
01:22:59,541 --> 01:23:01,375
Are you sure you will be safe?

896
01:23:02,875 --> 01:23:06,791
I'll be okay, but I can't protect you two
from my enemies when I'm not at home.

897
01:23:07,833 --> 01:23:10,333
Talk to me, Ashraf. Who are these enemies?

898
01:23:10,750 --> 01:23:12,791
You will be safe
with people I trust in Geneva.

899
01:23:13,250 --> 01:23:15,166
- That's not a clear answer.
- Listen.

900
01:23:16,041 --> 01:23:17,083
Listen to me.

901
01:23:17,250 --> 01:23:19,083
In a day or two, this will all blow over.

902
01:23:19,583 --> 01:23:20,791
I give you my word.

903
01:23:21,875 --> 01:23:22,750
I promise you.

904
01:23:24,625 --> 01:23:26,125
Come on, you'll miss your flight.

905
01:23:28,041 --> 01:23:29,958
It will all be fine. Trust me.

906
01:23:58,125 --> 01:24:00,291
- Bye-bye, my love.
- Bye-bye.

907
01:24:15,875 --> 01:24:19,750
We didn't find anything in his house.
He sent his family to Switzerland.

908
01:24:23,166 --> 01:24:26,500
I want to know every move he makes.

909
01:24:27,416 --> 01:24:29,750
I know he's onto something.

910
01:24:30,291 --> 01:24:34,416
We only need him to make one mistake.

911
01:24:39,541 --> 01:24:40,541
Yes.

912
01:24:41,125 --> 01:24:45,291
Libyan Arab Airlines
Flight 114 was en route to Cairo

913
01:24:45,375 --> 01:24:48,708
when it's believed to have entered
a sand storm over the Sinai Peninsula.

914
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:52,375
Against a backdrop of escalating
tensions in the Middle East,

915
01:24:52,458 --> 01:24:53,916
Israeli fighter jets are thought

916
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:57,291
to have mistakenly shot down
the Libyan commercial aircraft,

917
01:24:57,375 --> 01:25:00,458
which was carrying
113 passengers and crew,

918
01:25:00,541 --> 01:25:02,083
just five of whom have survived.

919
01:25:02,166 --> 01:25:05,416
It's been shot by military aircraft.

920
01:25:07,166 --> 01:25:11,500
Therefore, it is to be taken
as a premeditated mass murder.

921
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:16,250
The Israeli Foreign Minister
has expressed regret over the incident,

922
01:25:16,458 --> 01:25:19,833
while on the Arab streets
there have been mass protests

923
01:25:19,916 --> 01:25:21,750
against the Zionist aggressor.

924
01:25:23,250 --> 01:25:24,916
Retaliation is needed!

925
01:25:25,958 --> 01:25:28,000
A life for a life!

926
01:25:28,541 --> 01:25:29,875
An eye for an eye!

927
01:25:31,375 --> 01:25:32,791
I am Gaddafi!

928
01:25:33,541 --> 01:25:35,500
Nobody messes with us!

929
01:25:36,375 --> 01:25:38,291
Palestinian Black September fighters

930
01:25:38,375 --> 01:25:40,625
will carry out Gaddafi's revenge attack
in Rome.

931
01:25:40,708 --> 01:25:44,333
If you give Gaddafi your back,
Arab unity will fall apart.

932
01:25:46,083 --> 01:25:47,041
So be it.

933
01:25:48,083 --> 01:25:51,208
I won't write my name on a missile
that will kill innocent civilians.

934
01:25:51,500 --> 01:25:56,166
The Israelis made a tragic mistake.
Our action would be premeditated murder.

935
01:25:56,625 --> 01:25:58,541
That will not be our legacy.

936
01:26:01,583 --> 01:26:03,166
Let me meet with Gaddafi.

937
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:04,416
To what end?

938
01:26:05,625 --> 01:26:07,208
Ashraf, the man is a rabid dog.

939
01:26:07,791 --> 01:26:10,000
You won't be able
to talk him out of revenge.

940
01:26:12,250 --> 01:26:13,500
I don't want to.

941
01:26:14,833 --> 01:26:17,375
We give Gaddafi exactly what he wants;

942
01:26:18,291 --> 01:26:20,708
your implicit support
of an attack against Israel.

943
01:26:28,041 --> 01:26:32,916
I will broker the deal and supply weapons
to the Black September fighters...

944
01:26:34,166 --> 01:26:37,000
and with the help
of an Italian Intelligence contact...

945
01:26:39,291 --> 01:26:41,625
...ensure that the mission fails.

946
01:26:54,416 --> 01:26:56,500
Now!

947
01:26:56,708 --> 01:26:58,041
Hit! Come on!

948
01:26:58,125 --> 01:27:00,958
- It's not working.
- What do you mean? Try again!

949
01:27:04,250 --> 01:27:07,250
Leave the plane, shoot the police!

950
01:27:07,333 --> 01:27:09,041
- Try again!
- It's not working.

951
01:27:16,791 --> 01:27:20,333
And this will keep Gaddafi
and the Arabs on our side.

952
01:27:33,916 --> 01:27:35,041
- Hello?
- Hello.

953
01:27:35,375 --> 01:27:36,458
Oh, hold on.

954
01:27:39,416 --> 01:27:41,250
- Yes?
- Diana.

955
01:27:42,833 --> 01:27:46,666
- Ashraf. Is that really you?
- I know it's out of the blue.

956
01:27:46,750 --> 01:27:48,500
- How are you?
- I'm all right.

957
01:27:49,125 --> 01:27:50,500
It's been a while.

958
01:27:51,833 --> 01:27:53,791
Yes, I'm sorry I disappeared.

959
01:27:54,333 --> 01:27:57,916
- Don't worry, I managed.
- Darling, I have a favor to ask.

960
01:27:58,083 --> 01:27:59,000
Really?

961
01:27:59,333 --> 01:28:00,166
Yes.

962
01:28:00,875 --> 01:28:01,875
Tell me more.

963
01:28:02,875 --> 01:28:03,875
I'm all ears.

964
01:28:04,375 --> 01:28:07,000
Make sure you're fasting.

965
01:28:07,208 --> 01:28:08,250
In between meals.

966
01:28:09,375 --> 01:28:10,375
You're funny.

967
01:28:13,041 --> 01:28:14,041
Hello?

968
01:28:14,416 --> 01:28:16,708
It's your Angel.

969
01:28:16,875 --> 01:28:17,875
I'm listening.

970
01:28:18,291 --> 01:28:20,833
I hope you appreciate
I saved that plane in Rome.

971
01:28:21,416 --> 01:28:23,416
There were 120 souls on it.

972
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:27,000
- What do you want?
- I don't have much time so listen.

973
01:28:27,541 --> 01:28:31,416
There's a shipment of waste,
potassium waste, you hear me?

974
01:28:31,541 --> 01:28:32,708
Lots of potassium.

975
01:28:34,666 --> 01:28:37,708
- Potassium?
- Yes. I will need the manager himself.

976
01:28:38,708 --> 01:28:42,500
It's time we spoke face to face.
Now, I will be in London tomorrow.

977
01:28:42,583 --> 01:28:45,916
- Can you swing it?
- Okay, yes, but where are you now?

978
01:28:46,416 --> 01:28:47,583
Where are you right now?

979
01:28:47,958 --> 01:28:50,833
This is happening, Alex,
you understand me?

980
01:28:51,083 --> 01:28:54,416
- Look, we can talk about it.
- London, 10 p.m. tomorrow night.

981
01:28:55,291 --> 01:28:57,375
- I have to go.
- No, wait. Wait!

982
01:29:06,458 --> 01:29:08,750
Whoa! Again?

983
01:29:08,916 --> 01:29:12,041
We can't listen to this man,
he's not living in the real world.

984
01:29:12,708 --> 01:29:15,250
He wants to meet you,
give you the news in person.

985
01:29:15,666 --> 01:29:16,750
Where is he?

986
01:29:16,833 --> 01:29:19,000
With Arabic in the background,
I guess it's Cairo.

987
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:21,416
He said the word "potassium".

988
01:29:22,333 --> 01:29:23,250
Potassium?

989
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,666
Yeah, he never used that before.

990
01:29:27,250 --> 01:29:29,416
What he did in Rome was suicidal for him.

991
01:29:29,875 --> 01:29:32,333
He saved a lot of Israelis on that plane.

992
01:29:35,708 --> 01:29:36,708
I don't know.

993
01:29:38,083 --> 01:29:39,250
What if he's right?

994
01:29:40,083 --> 01:29:41,000
What if he's right?

995
01:29:41,916 --> 01:29:44,625
Then we knew
about an imminent attack and did nothing.

996
01:29:45,500 --> 01:29:46,625
And on Yom Kippur.

997
01:29:52,083 --> 01:29:53,291
What do you want to do?

998
01:29:54,125 --> 01:29:56,458
Cut him loose or get you to London?

999
01:30:00,916 --> 01:30:01,916
Ashraf!

1000
01:30:02,583 --> 01:30:04,333
Ashraf! Darling!

1001
01:30:04,833 --> 01:30:06,625
- So good to see you!
- Let me look at you.

1002
01:30:07,375 --> 01:30:10,875
- You look absolutely wonderful.
- So do you. Come on, darling.

1003
01:30:11,250 --> 01:30:14,000
Don't be shy. Show me your acting skills.

1004
01:30:14,083 --> 01:30:15,291
Oh, this is exciting.

1005
01:30:15,375 --> 01:30:16,375
Mm-hm.

1006
01:30:17,333 --> 01:30:19,416
Actually, don't film me, film them.

1007
01:30:19,833 --> 01:30:21,916
- Who?
- Them!

1008
01:30:26,250 --> 01:30:28,666
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

1009
01:30:31,250 --> 01:30:32,708
I think I know who she is.

1010
01:30:34,250 --> 01:30:36,000
She could be a cover for him.

1011
01:30:36,333 --> 01:30:37,416
Don't lose him.

1012
01:30:48,791 --> 01:30:50,708
I love these games of yours.

1013
01:31:01,583 --> 01:31:02,833
He's got a tail.

1014
01:31:03,833 --> 01:31:04,708
Got it, over.

1015
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,208
So, he did come to London
for his lover.

1016
01:31:27,250 --> 01:31:28,250
Thank you.

1017
01:31:29,083 --> 01:31:30,083
You're a princess.

1018
01:31:31,791 --> 01:31:35,750
If you're going to play James Bond,
you need to go all the way.

1019
01:31:37,416 --> 01:31:40,166
James Bond never needed
his friends to save him.

1020
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:45,416
They all run away eventually.

1021
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:54,041
- Diana...
- Ignore me. You go, you have to.

1022
01:31:55,791 --> 01:31:59,125
Take the back door to Ashford Lane.
They won't see you leave.

1023
01:32:03,916 --> 01:32:06,458
Goodbye, my mysterious young man.

1024
01:32:09,625 --> 01:32:10,625
Thank you.

1025
01:32:50,375 --> 01:32:51,541
Why are you late?

1026
01:32:52,458 --> 01:32:56,000
I've been on the phone with Cairo,
trying to get the latest information.

1027
01:32:56,083 --> 01:33:00,000
- I apologize for being late.
- It's okay, I just got in myself.

1028
01:33:01,791 --> 01:33:03,500
May I have a glass of water?

1029
01:33:03,583 --> 01:33:04,583
Of course.

1030
01:33:07,791 --> 01:33:08,791
Thank you.

1031
01:33:19,708 --> 01:33:23,791
Sadat intends to go to war tomorrow
with the cooperation of the Syrians.

1032
01:33:24,041 --> 01:33:25,958
Who did you get this information from?

1033
01:33:26,541 --> 01:33:29,083
General Shazly, and Sadat himself.

1034
01:33:29,625 --> 01:33:30,750
When will it be?

1035
01:33:31,833 --> 01:33:34,291
I didn't know until last night
that it's set for tomorrow.

1036
01:33:34,375 --> 01:33:36,416
I need an exact time Ashraf.

1037
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:43,333
They will attack,
tomorrow evening at six o'clock...

1038
01:33:43,833 --> 01:33:46,916
to take advantage of the sun
in the Israeli soldiers' eyes.

1039
01:33:51,583 --> 01:33:53,583
That's 18 hours away from now.

1040
01:33:53,875 --> 01:33:56,250
The Egyptian war plan calls
for passenger jets

1041
01:33:56,333 --> 01:33:58,250
to be re-routed to friendly states.

1042
01:33:58,708 --> 01:34:02,208
You can verify it with Egypt Air,
but I suggest you do it quickly.

1043
01:34:02,833 --> 01:34:04,916
Russians came through
with anti-aircraft missiles.

1044
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,125
This... is happening, General.

1045
01:34:14,625 --> 01:34:17,708
You told us war was coming
on two other occasions...

1046
01:34:18,416 --> 01:34:20,000
both of them false,

1047
01:34:20,250 --> 01:34:23,916
so why don't you tell me
why I should believe you this time.

1048
01:34:25,500 --> 01:34:26,916
Because if you don't...

1049
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:32,500
too many innocent people
will die on both sides, that's why!

1050
01:34:44,208 --> 01:34:45,291
Excuse us.

1051
01:34:45,833 --> 01:34:47,666
Sit in the other room, Ashraf.

1052
01:34:59,125 --> 01:35:01,958
If that man is lying,
he's the best liar I've ever seen.

1053
01:35:06,625 --> 01:35:07,625
Call it, Zvi.

1054
01:35:11,791 --> 01:35:16,750
You understand, that if I send a warning
back to Jerusalem of immediate war

1055
01:35:16,833 --> 01:35:19,333
on Yom Kippur, no less,
and war never comes...

1056
01:35:22,250 --> 01:35:25,375
this will be the end of more
than just our relationship.

1057
01:35:30,375 --> 01:35:31,500
I understand, sir.

1058
01:35:35,916 --> 01:35:36,916
You can go.

1059
01:35:40,958 --> 01:35:41,958
Ashraf!

1060
01:35:47,041 --> 01:35:48,041
Your money.

1061
01:36:10,875 --> 01:36:12,916
I don't know what I'm hoping for.

1062
01:36:14,083 --> 01:36:16,125
Another false alarm or a war?

1063
01:36:17,375 --> 01:36:19,000
I really believe him, Zvi.

1064
01:36:25,291 --> 01:36:27,208
I'll send a telegram to Jerusalem.

1065
01:36:32,791 --> 01:36:37,416
The company will sign the contract
today October 6th at 18:00 hours.

1066
01:36:37,791 --> 01:36:41,041
The meeting with The Angel
convinced me to send this message.

1067
01:36:41,291 --> 01:36:44,250
It is my sincere belief
he is speaking the truth.

1068
01:36:44,916 --> 01:36:45,958
Act accordingly.

1069
01:37:01,958 --> 01:37:03,000
Mona...

1070
01:37:03,083 --> 01:37:04,291
I love you.

1071
01:37:04,375 --> 01:37:05,375
Believe that.

1072
01:37:05,916 --> 01:37:08,791
- This is all in your head.
- No! It's not.

1073
01:37:08,916 --> 01:37:10,958
You promised you'd never lie to me.

1074
01:37:11,833 --> 01:37:12,750
I beg you.

1075
01:37:12,916 --> 01:37:16,083
This life you think is so fulfilling,
leave it behind, come back to us.

1076
01:37:16,166 --> 01:37:19,458
Your life is with your family.
Just come with me, my love.

1077
01:37:24,875 --> 01:37:26,375
You don't understand, I can't.

1078
01:37:38,833 --> 01:37:42,000
What we need is to practice
war games out in the open.

1079
01:37:43,166 --> 01:37:45,250
Make it look like we are going to invade.

1080
01:37:46,708 --> 01:37:49,666
Please don't do this,
Mr. President. Not now.

1081
01:37:56,916 --> 01:38:00,708
Your only chance for a peace agreement
comes if Israel loses the war.

1082
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,791
Not defeated entirely, but hurt.

1083
01:38:05,833 --> 01:38:09,208
And victory over Israel can
only be achieved with a surprise attack.

1084
01:38:09,708 --> 01:38:11,708
Which is impossible to achieve.

1085
01:38:13,541 --> 01:38:15,958
The Boy Who Cried Wolf.

1086
01:38:17,250 --> 01:38:19,125
I assume you know the story?

1087
01:38:20,541 --> 01:38:21,583
Go on...

1088
01:38:22,750 --> 01:38:26,208
Our army needs to prepare
for an attack in front of the Israelis...

1089
01:38:27,750 --> 01:38:29,208
and then do nothing.

1090
01:38:30,125 --> 01:38:32,791
A month later, more war games.

1091
01:38:33,833 --> 01:38:36,166
Soon, your opponent will grow tired
of looking so closely.

1092
01:38:37,166 --> 01:38:38,708
You have a major advantage.

1093
01:38:39,833 --> 01:38:43,750
The Israelis believe
you can never defeat them in war.

1094
01:38:44,625 --> 01:38:49,708
Bait them, fool them and let them think
they know what you are up to.

1095
01:38:51,208 --> 01:38:52,375
A bluff...

1096
01:38:52,916 --> 01:38:54,000
and another bluff.

1097
01:38:57,416 --> 01:39:00,750
And when they're lulled
into thinking you're all bluster...

1098
01:39:01,791 --> 01:39:03,916
and you have no cards left to play...

1099
01:39:05,541 --> 01:39:06,833
then you go all in.

1100
01:39:07,791 --> 01:39:09,291
And when will that be?

1101
01:39:10,375 --> 01:39:11,500
Yom Kippur.

1102
01:39:14,500 --> 01:39:18,500
This is the Israel news
from Jerusalem,

1103
01:39:18,916 --> 01:39:21,958
The time is 3 p.m. on Yom Kippur.

1104
01:39:22,458 --> 01:39:25,000
The Israeli Army reported
that shortly before 2 p.m.

1105
01:39:25,083 --> 01:39:28,375
Syrian and Egyptian armies
started a surprise attack

1106
01:39:28,458 --> 01:39:29,833
in the Sinai and Golan Heights.

1107
01:39:30,250 --> 01:39:33,083
...attacked at 1:55 p.m. Israeli time.

1108
01:39:33,291 --> 01:39:36,833
There are reports of panic in the streets
as news of the operation spread

1109
01:39:36,916 --> 01:39:39,875
across the country,
with Egyptian forces reported

1110
01:39:39,958 --> 01:39:43,541
to have pushed as far
as eight miles into the Sinai desert,

1111
01:39:43,625 --> 01:39:45,708
and remaining
beneath the protective umbrella

1112
01:39:45,791 --> 01:39:47,750
of their anti-aircraft batteries.

1113
01:39:49,500 --> 01:39:52,000
We need to weaken Israel,
not destroy it.

1114
01:39:52,541 --> 01:39:55,333
This way, we can force Israel
into negotiation,

1115
01:39:55,416 --> 01:39:57,500
and stop the heavy bloodshed.

1116
01:40:00,958 --> 01:40:03,541
So, we start a war on their holy day?

1117
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:07,916
War is a dirty business, sir.

1118
01:40:10,166 --> 01:40:13,000
As dirty as it gets.

1119
01:40:26,958 --> 01:40:29,875
After weeks
of heavy losses on all sides,

1120
01:40:29,958 --> 01:40:33,000
the United States has today secured
a ceasefire.

1121
01:40:48,458 --> 01:40:50,833
There is no clear winner
in this bloody conflict

1122
01:40:50,916 --> 01:40:53,250
that has claimed 17,000 lives.

1123
01:40:54,333 --> 01:40:56,000
But what remains a certainty

1124
01:40:56,125 --> 01:40:58,250
is that in a war
in which there are only losers...

1125
01:41:00,708 --> 01:41:03,000
...lasting peace is the only victory.

1126
01:41:14,625 --> 01:41:18,333
I have come to Jerusalem,
the city of peace...

1127
01:41:19,791 --> 01:41:23,625
which will always remain
as a living embodiment

1128
01:41:23,708 --> 01:41:28,916
of coexistence among believers
of the three religions.

1129
01:41:31,291 --> 01:41:34,041
When the bells of peace ring...

1130
01:41:34,833 --> 01:41:39,166
there will be no hands
to beat the drums of war.

1131
01:41:39,708 --> 01:41:44,291
Even if they existed, they would be still.

1132
01:41:45,416 --> 01:41:49,750
I pledge myself
with true and sincere words...

1133
01:41:49,833 --> 01:41:52,000
IT WASN'T JUST IN MY HEAD - MONA

1134
01:41:52,083 --> 01:41:55,166
...to every man,
woman and child in Israel.

1135
01:41:56,791 --> 01:41:58,791
You, sorrowing mother.

1136
01:41:59,541 --> 01:42:01,750
You, widowed wife.

1137
01:42:03,583 --> 01:42:06,958
You, the son
who lost a brother or a father.

1138
01:42:07,708 --> 01:42:10,125
All the victims of war...

1139
01:42:11,250 --> 01:42:15,333
fill the air and space
with recitals of peace.

1140
01:42:16,541 --> 01:42:21,125
Fill bosoms and hearts
with the aspirations of peace.

1141
01:42:22,041 --> 01:42:25,333
Make a reality that blossoms,

1142
01:42:25,416 --> 01:42:26,416
and lives.

1143
01:42:27,125 --> 01:42:31,625
Make hope a code of conduct and endeavor.

1144
01:42:33,166 --> 01:42:36,791
And I have come here to deliver a message.

1145
01:42:37,750 --> 01:42:41,625
I have delivered the message of peace.

1146
01:42:42,958 --> 01:42:45,291
May God be my witness.

1147
01:42:46,208 --> 01:42:48,208
Peace be upon you.

1148
01:42:49,416 --> 01:42:51,166
Peace be unto you.

1149
01:43:21,916 --> 01:43:24,708
How long has it been?
Nine, ten years?

1150
01:43:25,750 --> 01:43:26,916
It's been a while.

1151
01:43:27,625 --> 01:43:29,125
How are Mona and Gamal?

1152
01:43:29,500 --> 01:43:30,625
Gamal is fine.

1153
01:43:31,375 --> 01:43:35,541
Mona and I have agreed not to divorce.
We will just live separately.

1154
01:43:37,291 --> 01:43:41,083
Mona was sure I was meeting a lover,
Sami Sharaf helped dig that hole.

1155
01:43:43,166 --> 01:43:45,166
This is how liars are rewarded.

1156
01:43:45,458 --> 01:43:47,833
Even if you tell the truth,
no one believes you.

1157
01:44:02,208 --> 01:44:03,208
For you.

1158
01:44:04,708 --> 01:44:06,291
- What's this?
- Open it.

1159
01:44:15,458 --> 01:44:16,875
The Boy Who Cried Wolf.

1160
01:44:20,083 --> 01:44:21,500
I used to read it to Gamal.

1161
01:44:22,083 --> 01:44:24,916
Little shepherd boy
who cried "Wolf!" twice,

1162
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:26,708
so the third time no one believed him.

1163
01:44:30,291 --> 01:44:31,291
You're good.

1164
01:44:34,375 --> 01:44:35,416
Thank you...

1165
01:44:36,750 --> 01:44:37,750
for the book.

1166
01:44:42,625 --> 01:44:44,458
It's great to see you again, Danny.

1167
01:44:46,333 --> 01:44:47,333
You too, Ashraf.

1168
01:44:58,250 --> 01:44:59,416
You know, Ashraf...

1169
01:45:00,750 --> 01:45:02,708
there was a big inquiry after the war.

1170
01:45:04,625 --> 01:45:05,625
About you...

1171
01:45:06,458 --> 01:45:07,625
our conduct.

1172
01:45:08,083 --> 01:45:09,208
I'm not surprised.

1173
01:45:10,916 --> 01:45:14,166
A lot of questions,
a lot of finger-pointing.

1174
01:45:17,458 --> 01:45:20,916
You know, if I had been there,
I would have asked them:

1175
01:45:21,666 --> 01:45:24,625
"Is Israel better off
now that there is peace with Egypt?"

1176
01:45:29,291 --> 01:45:32,708
Then, no matter what,
you and I have served our countries well.

1177
01:45:36,166 --> 01:45:37,166
All the best.

1178
01:45:38,375 --> 01:45:39,375
You take care.

1178
01:45:40,305 --> 01:46:40,670
