But maybe there's a detail

35
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,980
you could've forgotten
to share with the police.

- Good morning, April.

Twenty years I've studied
the animal kingdom.

73

There are fat pigs,
there are fat cows.

There are no fat birds.

Picture you're leaving the cold north
and you're flying. You're migrating.

79
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,300
Four years of journalism
school so that I can do that.

you want to be a serious journalist.

I see you sniffing around the

But it's also okay to just
give people something

86
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,260
a little lighter. A little...
Little froth.

it's just, like, coffee,

It's kind of nice.

Vern, that's foam.

Yes, foam, froth, you get the point.

It's just... It's nice,
it tastes good, it's candy.

You ever heard the expression,
"Never take candy from a baby"?

94

It's because even babies love candy!

95
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,260
It's nice. And you're giving people

96
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,860
something they like
that's good and nice.

97

They look at you and they see,
"Wow, there's a nice... There's...

98

"...candy." The point is,

Hold on, the scanner said
that gunshots were heard,

but there were no reports
of any Foot Clan activity.

183
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,860
That's because whatever they were
attempting to do was stopped.

in Brooklyn anyway?

631
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,740
My dad used to work for him.

632
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,940
He's the only person
that's gonna be able

633
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,820
to tell me whether or not I'm crazy.

634
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,100
Crazy about what?

635
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,340
- I don't need you to laugh at me also.
- Oh, come on, O'Neil.

636
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,860
This is the Fenwick Express,
it's a judgment-free zone.

637
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,220
A cocoon of safety.

638
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,900
Promise?

639
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,300
I'm insulted that you
would suggest otherwise.

640
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,045
(ENGINE STARTING)

641
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:41,540
Ooh, 11 hours in the Ha'shi.

642
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,300
Are you sure none of
you want to tell me

643
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,100
where you were last night?

644
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,860
How you holding up, fellas?

645
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,881
Ah! I ain't breaking if
Donnie ain't breaking.

646
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,565
(WHIMPERING)

647
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,820
Experiencing intense
nausea but not breaking.

648
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:01,408
(CONTINUES WHIMPERING)

649
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,740
Guys? I'm in the zone!

650
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,930
There is literally nothing
that could break me right now!

651
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,260
Starting to break.

652
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:16,007
Of course, you've all tasted
the five-cheese pizza.

653
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,289
But this,

654
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:22,731
cheesemongers have speculated
of its existence for centuries.

655
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,620
Da Vinci's original masterpiece.

656
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,180
I submit to you...

657
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:31,820
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)

658
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,964
the 99-cheese pizza.

659
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,620
Oh!

660
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,820
It's not possible.

661
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,140
Mikey, it's a trap!

662
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,140
A pizza with that variety of cheese
is a culinary impossibility!

663
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:48,620
- Shall I list the ingredients?
- No.

664
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,180
- Cheddar...
- (STRAINING)

665
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,380
- Provolone...
- Mikey, don't you do it!

666
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,660
SPLINTER: Asiago...

667
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,060
- DONATELLO: Keep it together!
- Taleggio...

668
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,780
(SOFTLY)
I don't even know what that is.

669
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,844
Mozzarella, of course.

670
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,180
All right, all right, all right!

671
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,460
We left the lair because the
Foot were taking hostages

672
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,740
and we kicked some serious butt,

673
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,620
and there was this girl named April
O'Neil who took our picture,

674
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,380
- (GASPING) but we took care of it.
- RAPHAEL: Idiot.

675
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:15,460
Oh, no, my worst fears
have been realized.

676
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,460
Don't worry about it.
Donnie erased the picture!

677
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,740
We're not in danger.

678
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:23,380
No. It's April O'Neil
who is in danger!

679
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:26,460
Find the girl. Bring her here.

680
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,980
But, sensei, you said to not go...

681
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,020
Find the girl!

682
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,401
Find the girl.

683
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:39,051
APRIL: That's what I told
Thompson and she fired me.

684
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,805
So they're aliens?

685
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,100
No, that's stupid.

686
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,050
They're reptiles.

687
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,327
They help people, I guess.

688
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,166
Heroes in the half-shell.

689
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,201
- Okay.
- Come on. It's not that crazy. I...

690
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,780
The animal kingdom is full of...

691
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,889
I used to have a dog
that could moonwalk.

692
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,331
- Thanks for the ride, Vern.
- Yeah. No problem.

693
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,100
- (CAR DOOR CLOSING)
- Nothing better than

694
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,926
dropping off a pretty girl
at a rich guy's house.

695
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,220
(INTERCOM BEEPING)

696
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,842
Hi, it's April O'Neil,
here to see Eric Sacks.

697
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,700
April's arrived early this year.

698
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,220
I'm sorry to barge in on
you like this, Mr. Sacks.

699
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,140
No, no, no. Please, please.

700
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,260
Thank you.

701
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,900
APRIL: I've been working on a story.

702
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,020
And I have this theory that
there are these vigilantes

703
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,980
that are fighting back
against the Foot.

704
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,851
I think you and my father
may have created them.

705
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,660
Uh, I'm not sure I...

706
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,660
Can you please tell me
everything that you know

707
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,769
about Project Renaissance?

708
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,001
Hmm.

709
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,960
Well, um, it was a dream.

710
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,940
A dream that died with your father.

711
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,300
What if it isn't dead?

712
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,300
That's impossible.

713
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,540
We lost all our research in the fire,

714
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,580
all our specimens, everything.

715
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:24,260
I've spent the last 15 years
trying to replicate the results.

716
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:27,450
You didn't lose
everything in the fire.

717
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,780
- This can't be real.
- It is real.

718
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,923
I saw all four of them.

719
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:47,100
Do you really want to know
about Project Renaissance?

720
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,540
- Yes.
- Come with me.

721
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:53,970
I was born in Japan,
at a military base in Okinawa.

722
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:57,042
My father went to Vietnam.

723
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,380
Didn't come back.

724
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:02,126
I was an outsider in a foreign land.

725
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,540
A freak.

726
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,100
I was a powerless and helpless boy.

727
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,980
Until a local sensei
took me under his wing.

728
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,700
And he saved me.

729
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,260
Taught me lessons that I later
shared with your father.

730
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,900
Ninth-century Japan.

731
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,060
An evil warlord ruled the land.

732
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:24,180
He poisoned the water supply,
bringing on the dark ages.

733
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:27,100
Death and disease and
suffering ran rampant.

734
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,860
Not unlike the Foot Clan

735
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,780
and what they'd like
to do to our city.

736
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,980
Then one day, a hero arose.

737
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:37,300
A great alchemist
discovered the antidote

738
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,020
to the warlord's poison.

739
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,004
The cure-all

740
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,140
for his evil.

741
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:46,140
Your father and I were trying
to recreate that cure-all.

742
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,340
We developed a mutagen

743
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:51,500
capable of stimulating self-repair

744
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,768
on a cellular level.

745
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,248
What were you going to do with it?

746
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,842
Imagine New York City,

747
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,220
being victim to a chemical attack.

748
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:10,380
This mutagen would be able
to reverse its effects.

749
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,940
It would save the city,
it would save the people.

750
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,820
Those test subjects, those turtles...

751
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:22,180
Running in their blood is the
last of this precious mutagen.

752
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,926
And up until a few moments ago,

753
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,380
I thought we failed.

754
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,047
I thought they died
in the fire. How...

755
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,281
How could they have lived?

756
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,526
Because I saved them.

757
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,370
Of course you did.

758
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:44,121
April, the mutagen possesses powers

759
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:49,260
beyond our wildest hopes.

760
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,881
Whatever resources you need,

761
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,245
I'm here.

762
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,891
Let's work together. We'll find them.

763
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:01,084
The course of human
history may depend on it.

764
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,085
I'll show you out.

765
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,126
(SIGHS)

766
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:20,700
DONATELLO: Bam! You've been hacked!
By Donatello. Remember me?

767
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,100
Turtle. Four eyes.
But enough about me.

768
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,220
We told you we'd find you.
Meet us here.

769
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,761
And come alone. Or...
Or else we're...

770
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,971
You shall be punished and stuff.

771
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,940
Hello?

772
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,129
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

773
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,442
You told me to come here.

774
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,980
I didn't bring anyone with me.
I did exactly... (GASPS)

775
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,660
Okay! Are you April O'Neil?

776
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,420
Initiating retinal scan.

777
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,740
Scanning, scanning,
scanning, scanning.

778
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,460
Scan complete. It's her.
It's her. Guys, it's her!

779
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,100
Of course it's her, Donnie.

780
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,500
Hey. Really glad you could make it.

781
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:10,646
Hey. There's someone important we
want to introduce you to, but first...

782
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,780
MICHELANGELO:
Aw, yeah, welcome to my crib, girl.

783
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,860
APRIL: Where are we?

784
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,020
DONATELLO:
Hey, it's our Fortress of Solitude.

785
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,300
- MICHELANGELO: Our Hogwarts.
- DONATELLO: Our Xavier Academy.

786
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,460
MICHELANGELO: Our next generation,
state-of-the-art WonderDome!

787
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,380
(APRIL SNIFFS) Ugh.

788
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,940
Are we in the sewer?

789
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,260

01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:08,580
I'm sorry I was so hard on you.

1602
01:29:08,680 --> 01:29:11,580
Every time I pushed you,
I... I threatened you,

1603
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:13,980
I yelled at you, I pushed
you beyond your limits,

1604
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:16,180
it was because I believe in you!

1605
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:18,220
I believe in each one of you!

1606
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:21,300
I believe in your spirit
and your intelligence

1607
01:29:21,400 --> 01:29:23,020
and your potential.

1608
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:25,420
And every time I talked
about walking away,

1609
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:27,740
it was because I was scared!

1610
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:29,340
I just didn't think I was good enough

1611
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:30,700
to stand next to you

1612
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:33,860
and call you brothers and say to you

1613
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:35,844
I love you!

1614
01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:38,847

No, ding-dong.

What did he say? What did he say?

1627
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:43,124
He said, "Please get
your knee off my chest."

I'm sorry. This was all my fault.

1633

You were right. We weren't ready.

1634
01:30:56,520 --> 01:30:57,860
No.

1635
01:30:57,960 --> 01:31:02,860
It was I who wasn't
ready to let you go.

1636
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:05,460
All you needed was to discover

1637
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:10,402
that your true power lies
in believing in one another.

1638

How's your arm, Vern?

1641
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:34,380
Well, it wouldn't be
much use in a fight.

1642
01:31:34,480 --> 01:31:36,489
Not that I was much
use before, but...

1643
01:31:36,920 --> 01:31:39,122
- Did you get a new car?
- Yeah.

1644
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:41,860
You're looking at the
new Fenwick Express.

1645
01:31:41,960 --> 01:31:43,100
Pretty sweet, huh?

1646
01:31:43,200 --> 01:31:44,540
Kind of an upgrade.

1647
01:31:44,640 --> 01:31:47,769
I figured I'd need new wheels after
my old work vehicle went boom.

1648
01:31:47,880 --> 01:31:49,260
Yeah, Channel 6 gave it to me.

1649
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:52,540
They said don't put a scratch on it, but,
like, lightning's going to strike twice?

1650
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:55,180
So, is that why you called me here,

1651
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:57,540
to talk about your new car?

1652
01:31:57,640 --> 01:31:59,260
I know that you're not exactly

1653
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:01,660
a fancy restaurant kind
of girl, so I figured

1654
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:04,020
a creepy underpass in an
abandoned neighborhood

1655
01:32:04,120 --> 01:32:05,526
in the middle of the night
was more your speed.

1656
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:07,644
I wanted you to be comfortable.

What are you guys doing here?

1661
01:32:20,440 --> 01:32:24,406
We figured we owed you a
thanks for keeping our secret.

1662
01:32:26,280 --> 01:32:29,460
You had a lot to gain from
telling people about us,

1663
01:32:29,560 --> 01:32:31,000
but you had our backs.

1664

Yeah, 'cause that's what
family's for, Raph.

So you guys are driving now?

Yeah, man. I pimped this bad boy out.
