Colonel Strings to HQ
Colonel Strings to HQ

3
00:00:40,687 --> 00:00:44,987
Time is 05:21. Initiating
target penetration. Over.

4
00:00:52,232 --> 00:00:53,199
Let's go !

5
00:00:59,706 --> 00:01:01,867
Dreams come true. !

6
00:01:01,908 --> 00:01:05,571
From red deserts
to blue oceans !

7
00:01:05,612 --> 00:01:09,673
Astro Technologies is making
your dreams come true !

8
00:01:10,751 --> 00:01:14,983
We're advocating a project
to safely create oceans...

9
00:01:15,021 --> 00:01:18,718
...by using ice chunks
floating in orbit of Mars.

10
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:21,626
All we ask for
is your support...

11
00:01:21,661 --> 00:01:25,119
...and then we really can
make dreams come true !

12
00:01:41,081 --> 00:01:43,777
Antimatter reactor
has overloaded.

13
00:01:43,817 --> 00:01:46,445
Levels have reached
critical zone !

14
00:01:46,486 --> 00:01:50,513
Danger ! All personnel,
evacuate at once !

15
00:01:54,728 --> 00:01:58,459
For the sake of humanity, for the
sake of our righteous goal...

16
00:02:01,835 --> 00:02:02,859
DIE ! ! !

17
00:02:48,515 --> 00:02:50,540
The Third Project...?

18
00:02:51,518 --> 00:02:54,681
The reception of a distress
call from an antimatterplant...

19
00:02:54,721 --> 00:02:56,689
...on an isolated island
in the Pacific...

20
00:02:56,723 --> 00:03:00,022
...has resulted in the dispatch
of an army specialforces unit.

21
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:03,860
According to our investigation,
robots at the plant have rebelled...

22
00:03:03,897 --> 00:03:06,593
...resulting in the deaths of
many of the plant's staff.

23
00:03:06,633 --> 00:03:08,692
While the situation
is now under control...

24
00:03:08,735 --> 00:03:11,704
... we are currently waiting for a
comment from the robots'...

25
00:03:21,348 --> 00:03:22,940
Yoko !

26
00:03:22,983 --> 00:03:24,109
Bye-bye !

27
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,584
Good-bye, dear.

28
00:03:31,424 --> 00:03:33,585
Were you waiting long ?

29
00:03:34,094 --> 00:03:35,721
Mr. Oldman !

30
00:03:35,762 --> 00:03:39,698
Be sure her mother comes by to
help out at the bazaar tomorrow !

31
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,829
Uh... Right !

32
00:03:42,435 --> 00:03:44,403
You think mommy will come ?

33
00:03:44,638 --> 00:03:47,698
I don't no. She's not too
good with stuff like that.

34
00:03:59,653 --> 00:04:01,553
Mommy, we're home !

35
00:04:01,588 --> 00:04:03,818
Where are you, " Mommy ?"

36
00:04:03,857 --> 00:04:06,724
...and the anti-robotmovement
has now spread all over the world.

37
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,821
As a reaction, President Hemming
of the Earth Robotronics Union...

38
00:04:10,864 --> 00:04:12,729
...the leader in
the robot industry...

39
00:04:12,766 --> 00:04:15,792
...has just made a statement.
Let's see that recording.

40
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:19,506
The problem occurs in Seconds,
manufactured only on Mars...

41
00:04:19,506 --> 00:04:22,600
... which have a
fractal circuit installed.

42
00:04:22,642 --> 00:04:25,133
These things aren't necessary
for robots anyway.

43
00:04:25,178 --> 00:04:29,376
I hope the more frequent usage of
Earth-made Seconds equipped with...

44
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:31,184
...human obedience circuits is
considered in light of this incident.

45
00:04:31,184 --> 00:04:32,310

46
00:04:32,352 --> 00:04:33,787
That was President Hemming
of the ERU. In other news...

47
00:04:33,787 --> 00:04:35,221

48
00:04:35,221 --> 00:04:37,212

49
00:04:48,034 --> 00:04:50,468
- Happy birthday, Yoko.
- Congratulations, Yoko.

50
00:04:57,444 --> 00:05:00,106
A token of my
affection, Naomi.

51
00:05:05,085 --> 00:05:08,213
Is today your birthday, too,
Mommy ? Same as mine ?

52
00:05:15,362 --> 00:05:19,696
Yoko, those roses are my thanks for
this feast your mother made for us.

53
00:05:20,367 --> 00:05:21,834
Oh, I get it.

54
00:05:21,868 --> 00:05:25,167
Okay, then I'll give you
a thank-you present, too.

55
00:05:29,743 --> 00:05:31,711
My birthday, huh...?

56
00:07:05,105 --> 00:07:08,666
Today the Chicago Police announced the
submission of a bill to the Assembly...

57
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:11,802
...to reduce the number of robot police
officers who have been deployed...

58
00:07:11,845 --> 00:07:13,244
...to work on simple
duties such as...

59
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:15,782
...dealing with parking violations
and cleaning up after accidents.

60
00:07:15,782 --> 00:07:18,478
It's expected to pass
sometime this week.

61
00:07:22,856 --> 00:07:27,350
All right, after this commercial,
we'll be back with a live interview...

62
00:07:27,393 --> 00:07:31,352
...here at Blue 5 Netstudios with
Colonel Strings, the commander of...

63
00:07:31,397 --> 00:07:34,195
...the 404th mobile troops which
aided that antimatterplant.

64
00:07:46,246 --> 00:07:49,409
And now a Blue 5 Net
exclusive interview !

65
00:07:49,816 --> 00:07:53,081
You were the first man on-site
during the aid, is that correct ?

66
00:07:53,119 --> 00:07:56,520
Yes, ma'am. The first one in
and the last one out.

67
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:02,087
Were the robots so dangerous
that you needed to use guns ?

68
00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:07,725
The only survivors were 8 of my men
and just 3 of the plant's personnel.

69
00:08:07,767 --> 00:08:10,235
We tried our best.

70
00:08:11,104 --> 00:08:15,165
Are you on the side of the humans ?
Or are you on the side of the robots ?

71
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:17,472
My own beliefs
guide my actions.

72
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:20,673
Humans are humans
and robots are robots.

73
00:08:21,748 --> 00:08:24,444
Human rights are reserved
for humans only, I'd say.

74
00:08:24,951 --> 00:08:28,751
Thank you for your time.
That was Colonel Strings.

75
00:09:25,211 --> 00:09:28,237
This vehicle is in
violation of traffic laws.

76
00:09:28,514 --> 00:09:29,606
Further pursuit is--

77
00:10:35,915 --> 00:10:38,406
Who are you, lady ?

78
00:10:38,451 --> 00:10:41,284
I have some business with the
colonel. He's in there, isn't he ?

79
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:47,621
Right now, I'd say the colonel
is enjoying a nice drink !

80
00:10:52,398 --> 00:10:53,387
What the...?!

81
00:10:56,502 --> 00:10:57,491
BOO !

82
00:11:19,859 --> 00:11:24,887
A Second, enhanced for hand-
to-hand combat. Handmade...

83
00:11:25,531 --> 00:11:28,762
You're not human, are you ?

84
00:11:28,801 --> 00:11:32,567
Who are you supposed to be ?
The Tin Woodsman in a full-body cast ?

85
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,399
I may get a bonus if I just...

86
00:11:36,442 --> 00:11:39,878
...take your head back
with me, my little Dorothy.

87
00:11:51,457 --> 00:11:53,789
Ow... Damn, that thing's strong !

88
00:12:03,403 --> 00:12:07,066
I just need to have your head left,
or else I won't get any bonus.

89
00:12:45,845 --> 00:12:47,642
I may have overdone it...

90
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,114
" Rank: sergeant."

91
00:12:50,149 --> 00:12:52,845
" 404th mobile troops,
reserve forces."

92
00:12:53,786 --> 00:12:56,186
I knew it.
One of Strings's men.

93
00:13:21,848 --> 00:13:23,543
They sure have
this planned out...

94
00:13:28,888 --> 00:13:33,188
Yoko... This may take
longer than I expected.

95
00:13:49,609 --> 00:13:51,543
So, you're still alive...

96
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:55,513
The lost Third...

97
00:13:56,716 --> 00:14:00,277
The Angel of
Death and Life, eh ?

98
00:14:21,207 --> 00:14:23,505
Hm ? Oh, hi, Kevin.

99
00:14:23,543 --> 00:14:26,512
You're relieved. Anything
left for me to worry about ?

100
00:14:26,546 --> 00:14:28,946
- Not a damned thing.
- What's that ?

101
00:14:30,483 --> 00:14:35,216
Someone mailed in a threat.
Earth-lovers, most likely.

102
00:14:35,254 --> 00:14:37,484
They apparently
don't like the fact...

103
00:14:37,523 --> 00:14:40,526
...that we make high-compression
propellant here.

104
00:14:40,526 --> 00:14:43,290
They say Martians should
live in the deserts...

105
00:14:43,329 --> 00:14:45,263
...and stop wishing for oceans.

106
00:14:45,298 --> 00:14:47,232
Well, have a nice shift.

107
00:14:59,812 --> 00:15:02,645
All set... Good luck !

108
00:15:33,246 --> 00:15:34,270
Shit !

109
00:15:51,931 --> 00:15:55,492
You aren't going to break through
the security here ! Give up !

110
00:15:55,534 --> 00:15:58,697
Oh, we'll head straight home
after we blow up this facility...

111
00:15:58,738 --> 00:16:00,296
...and all the rocket fuel here !

112
00:16:07,013 --> 00:16:09,140
Come on ! Come on !
ls that all you've got ?!

113
00:16:21,027 --> 00:16:22,392
Shit !

114
00:16:24,397 --> 00:16:26,331
GOOD NIGHT, BABY !

115
00:16:48,321 --> 00:16:50,312
How are you ? Hurt bad ?

116
00:16:50,856 --> 00:16:52,847
Nah, it's nothing serious.

117
00:16:52,892 --> 00:16:56,658
Good to hear. Man, you did
a great job in there.

118
00:16:56,696 --> 00:16:58,823
Outstanding, really.

119
00:16:59,965 --> 00:17:02,729
Unfortunately, there are
some complications...

120
00:17:03,302 --> 00:17:04,269
Huh ?

121
00:17:05,905 --> 00:17:08,931
The police have just
issued a statement.

122
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:13,042
They stopped the vehicle
with the escaping terrorists...

123
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:15,877
...and arrested the last three.

124
00:17:16,182 --> 00:17:20,084
It's just... The three of
them are all robots.

125
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:23,555
Robots ?! But, what about
the ones I killed ?

126
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:25,318
They were human.

127
00:17:25,358 --> 00:17:27,121
Humans... ?!

128
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,028
But there was no way I
could tell in that situation !

129
00:17:30,062 --> 00:17:31,893
I know, I know.

130
00:17:31,931 --> 00:17:34,491
We'll have lawyers at
the press conference.

131
00:17:34,533 --> 00:17:37,058
The only words you'll say
are " No comment."

132
00:17:37,103 --> 00:17:39,663
Got that ? Everything will
be fine, so don't worry.

133
00:17:40,539 --> 00:17:43,030
And dress those bandages
up to make it look worse.

134
00:17:43,075 --> 00:17:45,669
You're a hero who risked
his life in the line of duty.

135
00:17:45,711 --> 00:17:49,511
A victim. Got that ?!
Okay, come on !

136
00:18:01,293 --> 00:18:03,227
Hi, Julian.

137
00:18:05,431 --> 00:18:06,989
Hi, Armitage.

138
00:18:07,066 --> 00:18:10,467
It's been a long time since
anyone's called me by that name.

139
00:18:10,503 --> 00:18:11,731
You saw it, right ?

140
00:18:11,771 --> 00:18:14,740
Yeah. You mean about
the First Error, right ?

141
00:18:14,907 --> 00:18:17,273
- Tell me about it.
- It doesn't interest me.

142
00:18:17,309 --> 00:18:19,869
- Why not ?
- Because I'm a ghost.

143
00:18:19,912 --> 00:18:22,073
I couldn't care less about
things in the mortal world.

144
00:18:22,114 --> 00:18:23,775
Julian !

145
00:18:27,386 --> 00:18:28,978
Thanks, Julian.

146
00:18:31,157 --> 00:18:32,886
Judging from the situation...

147
00:18:32,925 --> 00:18:37,328
...M. Kevin Oldman merely
carried out his duty, that's all.

148
00:18:37,663 --> 00:18:40,029
But the three human
terrorists are dead...

149
00:18:40,065 --> 00:18:43,557
... while their three robot
accomplices are completely unharmed.

150
00:18:43,602 --> 00:18:46,298
Is their a special reason
for that, M. Oldman ?

151
00:18:46,372 --> 00:18:49,535
I believe we explained
that already !

152
00:18:49,575 --> 00:18:51,042
When you have
terrorists who are...

153
00:18:51,076 --> 00:18:53,476
...ready to use a liquid
explosive bomb, breaking in...

154
00:18:53,512 --> 00:18:55,707
...do you think
there's time to sort out...

155
00:18:55,748 --> 00:18:57,477
...which are human and
which are robots ?!

156
00:18:57,516 --> 00:19:01,748
The question was for Kevin.
Please answer it, sir.

157
00:19:02,455 --> 00:19:06,084
He's been through enough today !
Would you cut it out already ?

158
00:19:06,459 --> 00:19:07,892
Hold it ! Just a moment !

159
00:19:09,962 --> 00:19:12,453
Are you one of those
robot fetishists ?

160
00:19:12,498 --> 00:19:14,489
Do you subscribe to
"Deep Robo" magazine ?

161
00:19:14,533 --> 00:19:16,402
Do you use a robot maid ?

162
00:19:16,402 --> 00:19:18,393
Ever had sex with a robot ?

163
00:19:18,437 --> 00:19:20,166
Would you all stop it ?!

164
00:19:20,206 --> 00:19:22,538
Robots only do what
they're ordered to do !

165
00:19:22,808 --> 00:19:24,435
The real criminals
are the humans !

166
00:19:29,281 --> 00:19:32,250
...and M. Oldman has gained
an amazing amount of support...

167
00:19:32,284 --> 00:19:35,219
...as the vanguard of those
who believe in Robot Rights...

168
00:19:35,254 --> 00:19:38,951
...and desire a new social order
which denies human supremacy.

169
00:19:38,991 --> 00:19:42,427
Furthermore, the incident is
expected to have a large effect...

170
00:19:42,461 --> 00:19:46,232
...on the upcoming Chicago Summit
between Earth and Mars in 2 weeks...

171
00:19:46,232 --> 00:19:48,427
... which will address
the Robot Rights bill.

172
00:19:48,467 --> 00:19:50,697
We have an analyst
here with an opinion.

173
00:19:50,736 --> 00:19:54,331
Should robots be granted
the same rights as humans ?

174
00:19:54,373 --> 00:19:56,432
Most of Earth has been
against it and would say no...

175
00:19:56,475 --> 00:19:58,670
...but the more liberal
Martians had favored it.

176
00:19:58,711 --> 00:20:02,010
Because of that, the bill was
expected to go nowhere...

177
00:20:02,047 --> 00:20:04,208
...but the aftermath
of the Fist Error...

178
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,878
...slightly moved Martian
public opinion against it.

179
00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:12,323
However, this latest incident has
vitalized Robot Rights activities.

180
00:20:13,459 --> 00:20:15,427
Well, our focus
now will be on...

181
00:20:15,461 --> 00:20:18,123
...how this all affects
the upcoming summit.

182
00:20:23,135 --> 00:20:27,868
You really did it this time, Kevin.
Or should I say Ross Sylibus ?

183
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:38,812
I'm sorry, all of the robot
doormen were let go.

184
00:20:38,884 --> 00:20:40,613
Let me get that
bag for you.

185
00:21:07,846 --> 00:21:09,780
Who are you ?

186
00:21:10,749 --> 00:21:12,580
You're Strings, right ?

187
00:21:12,618 --> 00:21:15,382
I came to ask why
you killed those robots.

188
00:21:15,421 --> 00:21:16,786
What ?

189
00:21:16,822 --> 00:21:19,725
I'm talking about all
those robots you killed.

190
00:21:19,725 --> 00:21:23,718
Killed ? Robots ?
Don't you mean "destroyed ?"

191
00:21:23,762 --> 00:21:25,389
Does that include
the humans, too ?

192
00:21:25,431 --> 00:21:28,992
You probably know that 18% of
that plant's staff was human.

193
00:21:30,536 --> 00:21:32,902
You act as though you
were there yourself.

194
00:21:34,807 --> 00:21:38,402
For the sake of humanity, for the
sake of our righteous goal...

195
00:21:40,045 --> 00:21:42,878
You... ! You're a robot ?!

196
00:21:49,388 --> 00:21:51,151
You're garbage !

197
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:53,249
Some sick monster
who gets off on killing !

198
00:21:53,425 --> 00:21:57,191
You killed them all to hide the existence
of the Third Project, didn't you ?!

199
00:21:57,696 --> 00:21:59,994
Third ? What are
you talking about ?

200
00:22:00,032 --> 00:22:01,567
Don't play dumb !

201
00:22:01,567 --> 00:22:03,034
Hold it !

202
00:22:04,103 --> 00:22:07,072
Hold it right there,
Naomi Armitage.

203
00:22:07,673 --> 00:22:09,163
Demitrio...

204
00:22:09,441 --> 00:22:12,035
I can just see
tomorrow's headlines:

205
00:22:12,077 --> 00:22:16,571
" Hero of the First Error suppression,
murdered by robot assassin."

206
00:22:17,049 --> 00:22:18,516
What ?!

207
00:22:44,443 --> 00:22:47,105
Sorry to have exposed you
to such unpleasantness.

208
00:22:47,146 --> 00:22:49,410
How do you
know my name ?

209
00:22:50,215 --> 00:22:52,206
Well, well, well !

210
00:22:52,251 --> 00:22:55,914
Has life on the run dulled
your detective's intuition ?

211
00:22:56,388 --> 00:22:59,357
My name is Demitrio Mardini.

212
00:22:59,391 --> 00:23:02,451
Executive Vice President
of Earth Robotronics.

213
00:23:03,262 --> 00:23:07,358
And you're the daughter of the great
genius, Dr. Asakura, are you not ?

214
00:23:10,035 --> 00:23:14,301
I've been looking forward to
meet you. This is an honor.

215
00:23:14,339 --> 00:23:16,273
Welcome to Earth, my dear !

216
00:23:16,308 --> 00:23:19,038
Now, shall we get
down to business ?

217
00:23:29,988 --> 00:23:31,717
I've brought him, sir.

218
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,259
It's been a long time,
Ross Sylibus.

219
00:23:39,665 --> 00:23:41,155
Mr. Chairman...

220
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:46,934
I called you here for a reason.
I need a favor, Ross.

221
00:23:47,106 --> 00:23:48,596
Y- Yes, sir...

222
00:23:48,874 --> 00:23:51,308
Would you go
to Earth, please ?

223
00:23:51,343 --> 00:23:54,403
I want you to attend
the Chicago Summit.

224
00:23:56,582 --> 00:24:01,212
As the representative
of me, Frederick Ohara...

225
00:24:01,253 --> 00:24:04,586
...chairman of the Martian
Development Foundation.

226
00:24:05,457 --> 00:24:07,652
You'll go, won't you ?

227
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,755
Me, sir...?

228
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:16,597
To begin with,
the remarkable advancements...

229
00:24:16,635 --> 00:24:21,072
...in robot production techniques on
Mars have been driven by necessity.

230
00:24:21,106 --> 00:24:23,336
The birth rate has been
dropping dramatically...

231
00:24:23,375 --> 00:24:25,309
...since the fourth
generation of colonists.

232
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:27,212
And there's a labor shortage.

233
00:24:27,212 --> 00:24:32,343
That, in turn, led to a need for
robots to be dependable partners.

234
00:24:33,852 --> 00:24:37,083
If they're to be partners,
they need to be given rights...

235
00:24:37,122 --> 00:24:40,148
...protected by law as good
citizens and good neighbours.

236
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:43,650
It's the only logical
outcome, isn't it ?

237
00:24:44,863 --> 00:24:47,388
But it's an outcome
I can't allow.

238
00:24:49,601 --> 00:24:52,502
Demand for the Seconds
imported from Mars...

239
00:24:52,538 --> 00:24:54,472
...is slowing my company down.

240
00:24:54,506 --> 00:24:57,771
And if the Robot Rights bill goes
through, things will get worse.

241
00:24:57,810 --> 00:25:01,678
It could shake every union
to its foundations.

242
00:25:01,914 --> 00:25:05,816
As a businessman,
I want to prevent that.

243
00:25:05,851 --> 00:25:08,479
So, you're spinning
a new scenario.

244
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:11,455
You made up the First Error,
the robot uprising.

245
00:25:12,157 --> 00:25:16,355
Not quite. The uprising
did actually happen.

246
00:25:19,364 --> 00:25:23,232
If you made it all the
way to Earth like this...

247
00:25:23,268 --> 00:25:25,236
...you must know
about that already.

248
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:28,034
I don't just know
about it ! I saw it !

249
00:25:28,073 --> 00:25:32,009
I'm carrying the memories of a
Third who was built in that plant !

250
00:25:32,945 --> 00:25:37,473
I see. It's fascinating how
you robots communicate...

251
00:25:37,916 --> 00:25:42,216
Listen to me. You Thirds live
a very sad existence.

252
00:25:42,688 --> 00:25:46,647
No one will acknowledge you exist,
and so you're doomed to be forgotten.

253
00:25:46,692 --> 00:25:50,423
What I want is to give you all a
clear and specific purpose in life :

254
00:25:50,863 --> 00:25:53,627
The creation of human beings !

255
00:25:53,665 --> 00:25:55,496
A most honorable
purpose, is it not ?

256
00:25:56,201 --> 00:25:59,136
Oh, that's bullshit ! Why do
you think the Thirds rebelled...

257
00:25:59,171 --> 00:26:01,298
...when they were forced
into that research ?!

258
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,965
Well, I can't believe it.

259
00:26:04,309 --> 00:26:09,110
Your friends tried to escape
from the Garden of Eden.

260
00:26:10,282 --> 00:26:13,718
Listen, this is a wonderful
operation I'm proposing.

261
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:17,453
From time immemorial, the most
difficult task has been...

262
00:26:17,489 --> 00:26:19,923
...the creation of humans
you can manipulate freely.

263
00:26:21,026 --> 00:26:23,324
Now you can do it.

264
00:26:23,362 --> 00:26:25,853
You can make a cheap labor
force who will never complain.

265
00:26:25,898 --> 00:26:27,832
Or produce soldiers
who aren't afraid of dying.

266
00:26:27,866 --> 00:26:29,993
Creating people to simply love
would be nice, too, wouldn't it ?

267
00:26:30,035 --> 00:26:32,697
The ultimate product,
wouldn't you say ?

268
00:26:33,538 --> 00:26:36,837
You...
You want to play God ?

269
00:26:39,077 --> 00:26:40,669
Not quite...

270
00:26:40,879 --> 00:26:44,337
Perhaps just have the
power of one of His chosen.

271
00:26:44,383 --> 00:26:47,784
And that's why you killed the
human staff members as well.

272
00:26:47,819 --> 00:26:49,787
Yes, that's right.

273
00:26:52,391 --> 00:26:56,061
So, won't you come with me ?
To my Garden of Eden ?

274
00:26:56,061 --> 00:26:59,929
If you have that other Third's
memories, you must understand.

275
00:26:59,965 --> 00:27:02,866
I need your power.
I need you...

276
00:27:02,901 --> 00:27:05,893
The original Third.

277
00:27:06,571 --> 00:27:08,173
Go to hell.

278
00:27:08,173 --> 00:27:10,038
You disappoint me.

279
00:27:16,615 --> 00:27:17,411
Grab her !

280
00:27:20,152 --> 00:27:22,279
You seem to be in pain
all of a sudden.

281
00:27:34,566 --> 00:27:37,467
So, how do you like
its jamming functions ?

282
00:27:48,347 --> 00:27:49,871
All right ! Take her !

283
00:27:54,753 --> 00:27:56,516
What's wrong ?!

284
00:28:01,626 --> 00:28:04,424
This date's over.
You're just not my type !

285
00:28:29,354 --> 00:28:32,858
Did she get away ?
Or is she dead ?

286
00:28:32,858 --> 00:28:35,258
No...
She's a Third, after all...

287
00:29:41,259 --> 00:29:44,023
Oh, I found a
real beauty here !

288
00:29:44,062 --> 00:29:47,395
This isn't some consumer model you
can get off the assembly lines !

289
00:29:47,432 --> 00:29:50,458
Skeletal frame says
" Made on Mars."

290
00:29:51,803 --> 00:29:55,034
Well, let's ask this little
stranger who she is...

291
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:01,006
These are her
latest memories.

292
00:30:03,415 --> 00:30:06,316
I doubt it misfired...

293
00:30:08,353 --> 00:30:10,116
Oh, I see...

294
00:30:10,155 --> 00:30:13,147
She took over its power systems
and then must have activated...

295
00:30:13,191 --> 00:30:16,126
...the gun's safety and its
proximity fuse at the same time.

296
00:30:16,161 --> 00:30:19,289
Well, that's how you use
telepresence abilities !

297
00:30:19,664 --> 00:30:21,393
Hey !

298
00:30:21,433 --> 00:30:23,731
Quit poking around
in my memories !

299
00:30:24,703 --> 00:30:26,694
Didn't mean any harm !

300
00:30:26,738 --> 00:30:30,675
I'm Mouse, a repairman.
And you, my dear, are a mess.

301
00:30:30,675 --> 00:30:34,270
Your main autonomous nerve lines and
vital parts are completely severed.

302
00:30:34,312 --> 00:30:36,212
If you went to a dealer...

303
00:30:36,248 --> 00:30:40,116
...they'd tell you to forget about
repairs and just buy a new body !

304
00:30:40,785 --> 00:30:44,243
Unfortunately, I'm kinda
attached to this body.

305
00:30:44,289 --> 00:30:46,883
Anyway, l need to move again.
Can you do that ?

306
00:30:46,925 --> 00:30:50,952
CAN I ? I am a genius !

307
00:30:51,196 --> 00:30:53,630
However, it'll cost you.

308
00:30:53,665 --> 00:30:56,600
Payment to be made in
Earth dollars. And no IOUs !

309
00:31:24,229 --> 00:31:27,255
We will soon be arriving
at the orbital station.

310
00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:30,936
The following connecting shuttles
are scheduled to leave from there:

311
00:31:30,936 --> 00:31:34,167
Chicago, flight 102,
departing at 13:00.

312
00:31:34,206 --> 00:31:35,264
Basilia, flight 347...

313
00:31:35,307 --> 00:31:39,073
Daddy, it's just like
you said ! It's so pretty !

314
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:41,806
Toonto, flight 618,
departing at 14:10.

315
00:31:41,846 --> 00:31:43,473
Yeah...

316
00:31:44,216 --> 00:31:46,878
Would you go
to Earth, please ?

317
00:31:48,119 --> 00:31:49,643
We've worked so hard on...

318
00:31:49,688 --> 00:31:52,680
...the Robot Rights summit
and have gotten so far.

319
00:31:52,724 --> 00:31:55,887
I naturally intended
to attend it myself...

320
00:31:55,927 --> 00:32:00,125
...but in light of what happened
to you, I've changed my mind.

321
00:32:02,667 --> 00:32:05,397
Earth is very nervous about...

322
00:32:05,437 --> 00:32:08,429
...the rising drive for
Martian independence.

323
00:32:08,473 --> 00:32:10,566
They're threatened
by the pressure for...

324
00:32:10,609 --> 00:32:12,543
...the Zephyria Terra
forming project.

325
00:32:12,577 --> 00:32:14,545
And now they're
telling us to accept...

326
00:32:14,579 --> 00:32:17,343
...40 million immigrants during
the fourth stage of development.

327
00:32:17,382 --> 00:32:19,043
Their attitude is drastic.

328
00:32:19,818 --> 00:32:25,586
The point is, Earth wants to
keep Mars as its colony.

329
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,158
Despite what it says,
we all need robots now.

330
00:32:33,198 --> 00:32:38,226
Not just for Martian development,
but for humanity's future.

331
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:41,205
And the Rights bill is
necessary for that future.

332
00:32:41,239 --> 00:32:45,266
I agree with you.
But, why me, sir ?

333
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:48,143
Because you're the
man for the time.

334
00:32:48,613 --> 00:32:50,911
The hero of Mars.

335
00:32:51,449 --> 00:32:57,410
Oh, you may not have intended
to become that, but you are now.

336
00:32:58,089 --> 00:33:01,626
I would like to use your
standing to full advantage...

337
00:33:01,626 --> 00:33:04,356
...in getting the Robot
Rights bill passed.

338
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:10,635
Ross... You can't keep
hiding forever.

339
00:33:10,635 --> 00:33:15,334
This is also a good chance to
ensure Yoko's future, isn't it ?

340
00:33:17,942 --> 00:33:23,209
Let's say, if you scratch
my back, I'll scatch yours...

341
00:33:24,449 --> 00:33:26,314
Thank you for choosing
All Martian Spacelines today.

342
00:33:26,351 --> 00:33:28,819
What have you
got there, Yoko ?

343
00:33:28,853 --> 00:33:30,753
It's a secret !

344
00:33:32,891 --> 00:33:35,451
I hope we see
Mommy soon...

345
00:33:36,328 --> 00:33:40,230
And with 2 days to go until the
Chicago Summit on Robot Rights opens...

346
00:33:40,265 --> 00:33:43,632
...All Martian Spacelines
flight 102 landed...

347
00:33:43,668 --> 00:33:46,728
... with the Martian
representatives today.

348
00:33:47,305 --> 00:33:51,639
Among them is this man,
currently the talk of the town.

349
00:33:51,676 --> 00:33:53,769
M. Kevin Oldman.

350
00:33:53,812 --> 00:33:55,714
As a result of his comments...

351
00:33:55,714 --> 00:33:58,583
...made after the terrorist attack on
Astro Technologies only days ago...

352
00:33:58,583 --> 00:34:00,752
...he's received overwhelming
support from Robot Rights activists.

353
00:34:00,752 --> 00:34:02,879

354
00:34:27,078 --> 00:34:28,045
Nice job !

355
00:34:42,394 --> 00:34:44,919
Okay, I have a few
little things to do now.

356
00:34:44,963 --> 00:34:47,022
Once I'm done,
we'll go look for Mommy.

357
00:35:12,624 --> 00:35:15,991
Before the opening of today's
summit on Robot Rights...

358
00:35:16,027 --> 00:35:18,860
...all of the major
robotronics companies'..

359
00:35:18,897 --> 00:35:21,457
...sagging stockprices
are now taking off.

360
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,232
This is due to their announcement
that all robots will now be made...

361
00:35:26,271 --> 00:35:30,275
... with a slave circuit installed
which will guarantee loyalty...

362
00:35:30,275 --> 00:35:32,937
...and ensure that robots
will never harm humans.

363
00:35:33,244 --> 00:35:35,678
Stockholdes are also reacting
positively to the possibility...

364
00:35:35,713 --> 00:35:38,273
...that the industry's healthy
economy might be restored...

365
00:35:38,316 --> 00:35:40,546
...should the Robot Rights bill
fail to win passage.

366
00:36:12,817 --> 00:36:16,309
Welcome, Mr. Oldman.

367
00:36:16,354 --> 00:36:19,983
What's going on here ?!
Where's my daughter ?!

368
00:36:20,024 --> 00:36:23,790
Please, calm down.
As you can see, she's unharmed.

369
00:36:24,896 --> 00:36:25,885
Yoko !

370
00:36:28,533 --> 00:36:30,635
Why are you doing this ?!

371
00:36:30,635 --> 00:36:33,570
I want you to vote against
the Robot Rights bill.

372
00:36:33,605 --> 00:36:34,936
What ?!

373
00:36:34,973 --> 00:36:37,237
The reason being...
Well...

374
00:36:37,275 --> 00:36:39,743
If I call you this,
will you understand then...

375
00:36:41,946 --> 00:36:43,811
...Ross Sylibus ?

376
00:36:43,848 --> 00:36:45,372
How did you... ?!

377
00:36:49,454 --> 00:36:52,321
You seem to
catch on fast.

378
00:36:52,357 --> 00:36:54,018
If you vote against the bill...

379
00:36:54,058 --> 00:36:57,084
...your pretty little daughter
will be returned unharmed.

380
00:36:57,128 --> 00:37:00,791
If you don't do
as I ask, well...

381
00:37:01,032 --> 00:37:03,762
It's all up to you, isn't it ?

382
00:37:04,369 --> 00:37:05,927
It's now time for the vote...

383
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:09,030
...at the much anticipated
Chicago Summit on Robot Rights.

384
00:37:09,073 --> 00:37:11,803
Let's now go live
via relay to the summit.

385
00:37:16,381 --> 00:37:17,541
Ross...?

386
00:37:18,182 --> 00:37:19,984
We will begin
taking the vote.

387
00:37:19,984 --> 00:37:22,487
All those in favor of
the new bill from Mars...

388
00:37:22,487 --> 00:37:25,285
...the Robot Rights bill,
please standup.

389
00:37:27,458 --> 00:37:29,358
What's going on ?

390
00:37:30,795 --> 00:37:34,026
As expected, all the Martian
delegates are for the bill...

391
00:37:34,065 --> 00:37:37,159
... while all of the Earth
delegates oppose it.

392
00:37:37,201 --> 00:37:39,396
Once again the Martian
bill will not easily pass--

393
00:37:41,406 --> 00:37:42,566
What's this ?!

394
00:37:42,607 --> 00:37:45,735
M. Oldman, one of the Martian
delegates, isn't standing in support!

395
00:37:45,777 --> 00:37:49,076
If he doesn't stand,
the bill will be thrown out !

396
00:37:49,714 --> 00:37:51,477
He's up ! No, wait !

397
00:37:51,516 --> 00:37:52,414
Ross !

398
00:37:53,251 --> 00:37:55,412
He 's approaching the chairman.

399
00:37:58,089 --> 00:38:02,583
Three votes for passage,
four against, one abstention.

400
00:38:02,627 --> 00:38:04,891
The motion is denied !

401
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:08,421
M. Oldman has
abstained from the vote !

402
00:38:08,466 --> 00:38:10,525
This is a completely
unexpected turn !

403
00:38:10,568 --> 00:38:12,502
The bill has not passed !

404
00:38:17,442 --> 00:38:21,708
He abstained...
Well, I'll let it go.

405
00:38:59,751 --> 00:39:02,083
What am I missing ?

406
00:39:03,554 --> 00:39:06,682
Or are you telling me
the ability to conceive life...

407
00:39:06,724 --> 00:39:08,817
...is only in the
province of God...?

408
00:39:13,898 --> 00:39:17,197
Hi there, Demitrio !
You want my data ?

409
00:39:17,769 --> 00:39:20,761
Hi there, Demitrio !
You want my data ?

410
00:39:20,805 --> 00:39:22,636
Who's...?

411
00:39:23,775 --> 00:39:25,402
Yes.

412
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:28,344
Then I'll transfer
some sample data for you.

413
00:39:28,379 --> 00:39:32,372
If you want the merchandise,
contact Mouse Robot Service.

414
00:39:32,583 --> 00:39:34,380
Your password is...

415
00:39:35,653 --> 00:39:38,144
An informant, eh ?
Interesting...

416
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:57,773
All set.

417
00:39:59,677 --> 00:40:03,841
Please feel free to deal with
Mouse Robot Service any time.

418
00:40:03,881 --> 00:40:06,315
You now have the
last of the data...

419
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:08,250
Hold it.

420
00:40:08,286 --> 00:40:10,345
Let me confirm this.

421
00:40:19,263 --> 00:40:21,663
So, this is the last
of the data, you say ?

422
00:40:22,467 --> 00:40:25,664
BULLSHIT !
This isn't all of it !

423
00:40:25,703 --> 00:40:30,436
It is, I swear ! What you
wanted is on that disc, too !

424
00:40:33,144 --> 00:40:36,636
What I want is the data
on her ability to conceive !

425
00:40:38,616 --> 00:40:39,984
Wh- What... ?!

426
00:40:39,984 --> 00:40:41,815
Tell me !
Where are you hiding it ?!

427
00:40:41,853 --> 00:40:43,514
I don't know about
any such data !

428
00:40:43,554 --> 00:40:47,115
If it's in there,
it's somewhere out of my reach !

429
00:40:47,158 --> 00:40:49,251
Anyway, I gave you
everything I have !

430
00:40:49,293 --> 00:40:53,127
If you can't analyze it,
your system must be obsolete !

431
00:40:53,164 --> 00:40:54,995
Don't play dumb !
I can't complete...

432
00:40:55,032 --> 00:40:57,432
...the conception functions
with just this data !

433
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:01,229
That's impossible !

434
00:41:01,272 --> 00:41:04,537
You should be able to clone her
exactly by copying the hardware...

435
00:41:05,076 --> 00:41:07,271
Something must
be wrong, then...!

436
00:41:09,247 --> 00:41:10,646
You...!

437
00:41:14,352 --> 00:41:18,413
You don't have the vital piece ?!
Some informant !

438
00:41:43,014 --> 00:41:45,107
What the...?!

439
00:41:52,456 --> 00:41:54,117
Armitage...?

440
00:42:01,766 --> 00:42:05,429
Just like her, aren't they ?
99% like her, at least.

441
00:42:05,469 --> 00:42:08,461
But I'm still missing
that last, vital part.

442
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:12,032
Now then, give me
the remaining data.

443
00:42:12,143 --> 00:42:15,169
I told you, I don't have it !

444
00:42:15,213 --> 00:42:18,307
Don't you want to see robots
who can give birth to children ?

445
00:42:18,349 --> 00:42:20,044
Oh, get real !

446
00:42:24,322 --> 00:42:26,552
He must have a
connector somewhere.

447
00:42:27,158 --> 00:42:30,025
Rip the data out
of his memory bank.

448
00:42:51,115 --> 00:42:52,514
Well ?

449
00:42:54,118 --> 00:42:55,983
Shit...

450
00:42:58,155 --> 00:43:01,647
All that leaves us
with is the daughter.

451
00:43:03,027 --> 00:43:05,587
Dump this trash
in the bin, would you ?

452
00:43:21,212 --> 00:43:25,410
That son of a bitch !
I won't forget this !

453
00:43:25,716 --> 00:43:29,345
I swear... He'll regret
messing with me...!

454
00:43:34,392 --> 00:43:36,792
Hotel Royal Greenhill.

455
00:43:36,827 --> 00:43:39,387
The Martian Development
Foundation representatives, please.

456
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:41,591
Well, they've
gone already...

457
00:43:41,632 --> 00:43:43,759
M. Kevin Oldman, as well ?

458
00:43:43,801 --> 00:43:48,966
No, he isn't back yet, so he's still
registered as staying in this hotel.

459
00:43:49,907 --> 00:43:52,171
Can l help you
with anything else ?

460
00:43:54,011 --> 00:43:57,310
No, nevermind.
Thank you.

461
00:44:01,319 --> 00:44:03,287
What's happened, Ross ?

462
00:44:44,595 --> 00:44:46,495
Sorry to keep you waiting.

463
00:44:47,665 --> 00:44:52,125
Where's my daughter ?!
You promised me you'd return her !

464
00:44:52,636 --> 00:44:56,766
Relax. As promised,
you'll be with your daughter again...

465
00:44:59,143 --> 00:45:00,371
In Heaven.

466
00:45:01,545 --> 00:45:03,479
You were planning this
from the start, weren't you ?!

467
00:45:07,385 --> 00:45:08,784
What the hell...?

468
00:45:08,953 --> 00:45:10,352
Get out !

469
00:45:10,621 --> 00:45:12,714
Who the hell are you ?!

470
00:45:12,757 --> 00:45:14,486
Police officer !

471
00:45:15,092 --> 00:45:16,821
Well, formerly...

472
00:45:34,245 --> 00:45:35,940
Why, you...!

473
00:45:49,827 --> 00:45:51,089
What ?!

474
00:45:52,863 --> 00:45:54,091
These guys are nuts !

475
00:47:51,448 --> 00:47:53,882
The day Yoko was born...

476
00:47:53,918 --> 00:47:58,287
I was so happy. The happiest
I've ever been in my life .

477
00:47:59,557 --> 00:48:02,151
But I was worried, too.

478
00:48:04,361 --> 00:48:08,263
I was worried that, one day,
I might lose both you and Yoko.

479
00:48:14,505 --> 00:48:16,166
I'm sorry.

480
00:48:16,207 --> 00:48:18,402
I'm sorry I left
without telling you.

481
00:48:19,677 --> 00:48:22,942
But I just had to
know the truth.

482
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:25,244
Because I'm a Third, too.

483
00:48:27,952 --> 00:48:31,513
And now my precious little
Yoko is mixed up in all this.

484
00:48:32,623 --> 00:48:34,921
Some mother I am...!

485
00:48:48,539 --> 00:48:50,370
Naomi...

486
00:48:50,407 --> 00:48:53,240
Stop trying to take on
every problem by yourself.

487
00:48:58,916 --> 00:49:03,387
We can change our names
and forge new identities...

488
00:49:03,387 --> 00:49:06,220
...but if we can't
escape our destiny...

489
00:49:06,257 --> 00:49:08,191
...then we'll fight it.

490
00:49:09,093 --> 00:49:12,824
For Yoko...
And for us as a family.

491
00:49:15,966 --> 00:49:17,558
Ross...!

492
00:49:17,601 --> 00:49:20,092
Yoko's waiting.
Let's go get her.

493
00:49:28,078 --> 00:49:30,706
Thank you, Ross...

494
00:50:04,782 --> 00:50:07,012
Your ID can't be confirmed.

495
00:50:07,051 --> 00:50:10,854
If you do not leave within 10 seconds,
you will be removed by force !

496
00:50:10,854 --> 00:50:12,014
Ten !

497
00:50:12,056 --> 00:50:13,157
Nine !

498
00:50:13,157 --> 00:50:14,181
Eight !

499
00:50:14,224 --> 00:50:15,282
Seven !

500
00:50:15,326 --> 00:50:16,293
Six !

501
00:50:16,327 --> 00:50:19,660
I'm here for my daughter.
Now move !

502
00:50:19,697 --> 00:50:20,789
Two !

503
00:50:20,831 --> 00:50:21,763
One !

504
00:50:53,230 --> 00:50:56,791
If you've harmed
my daughter, I'll kill you !

505
00:51:00,337 --> 00:51:02,999
I'll keep that in mind.

506
00:51:31,368 --> 00:51:35,668
Give me the company info of
this building ! Search: Demitrio !

507
00:51:40,010 --> 00:51:41,307
There !

508
00:51:43,013 --> 00:51:45,038
Ross ! Do you hear me ?!

509
00:51:45,082 --> 00:51:46,150
Yeah !

510
00:51:46,150 --> 00:51:48,846
Room 49, level 258 !

511
00:51:48,886 --> 00:51:51,912
It's some sort of lab,
but I think she's in there !

512
00:51:52,823 --> 00:51:55,359
Naomi, I just contacted Mars !

513
00:51:55,359 --> 00:51:59,090
I've had a shuttle readied for us
on an unused orbit elevator !

514
00:51:59,430 --> 00:52:01,830
It takes off at 5:00 AM !
That gives us four hours !

515
00:52:04,067 --> 00:52:06,670
Naomi, don't do
anything reckless.

516
00:52:06,670 --> 00:52:09,173
They're after my secret.

517
00:52:09,173 --> 00:52:11,835
I'm not gonna let them get
their hands on me so easily.

518
00:52:14,244 --> 00:52:15,836
Anyway,
don't underestimate them.

519
00:52:17,581 --> 00:52:19,048
I hear you.

520
00:52:38,936 --> 00:52:41,029
What, him again ?!

521
00:52:51,715 --> 00:52:53,615
You wanna end up
like you did before ?

522
00:52:53,650 --> 00:52:56,016
You're a slow learner,
aren't you ?

523
00:52:59,857 --> 00:53:02,690
I'd prefer if you wouldn't wreck
anymore of my merchandise.

524
00:53:03,694 --> 00:53:05,457
Demitrio !

525
00:53:05,496 --> 00:53:07,361
Shall we discuss this ?

526
00:53:07,397 --> 00:53:10,366
All I'll discuss is you
giving me my daughter back !

527
00:53:11,168 --> 00:53:13,659
Sure you want to brush
me off so quickly ?

528
00:53:19,610 --> 00:53:20,634
Yoko !

529
00:53:26,183 --> 00:53:29,209
You can't release her.
I have the access protected.

530
00:53:35,893 --> 00:53:37,053
Is this it ?

531
00:53:42,132 --> 00:53:43,224
Shit !

532
00:53:44,301 --> 00:53:46,997
The door's locked !
Can you release it ?

533
00:53:47,638 --> 00:53:51,438
Impossible. It's protected, so my
telepresence won't work !

534
00:53:51,575 --> 00:53:54,976
Ross, there's something else !
Listen to me ! That room's a freezer !

535
00:53:55,579 --> 00:53:57,410
What ?!

536
00:53:57,447 --> 00:53:58,778
Yoko's in danger !

537
00:53:58,815 --> 00:54:01,943
I'll buy some time.
Ross, you'll have to handle it.

538
00:54:15,198 --> 00:54:17,098
There, that's better.

539
00:54:27,744 --> 00:54:28,802
Shit !

540
00:54:57,541 --> 00:55:00,738
I ran some tests on
your daughter's body.

541
00:55:00,777 --> 00:55:03,644
I found no unusual
abilities in her.

542
00:55:04,581 --> 00:55:08,278
How disappointing.
Just a normal child...

543
00:55:08,986 --> 00:55:12,046
What did you do to Yoko ?!
Did you hurt her ?!

544
00:55:13,256 --> 00:55:18,159
Hurt her ? My dear,
I'm not a barbarian !

545
00:55:18,195 --> 00:55:22,757
I just took some small
blood and tissue samples.

546
00:55:23,066 --> 00:55:27,093
You can relax. I have
no use for a normal child.

547
00:55:41,318 --> 00:55:42,512
Daddy...

548
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:45,986
I'm a lenience man.

549
00:55:46,556 --> 00:55:50,720
I'm willing to forget the
considerable damage and rudeness...

550
00:55:50,761 --> 00:55:54,197
...you and your husband have
inflicted on my company.

551
00:55:54,598 --> 00:55:57,501
However, that depends
on you telling me...

552
00:55:57,501 --> 00:55:59,935
...what the secret
of the Thirds is.

553
00:56:01,405 --> 00:56:02,167
Daddy !

554
00:56:05,842 --> 00:56:08,504
The secret of your
ability to conceive life.

555
00:56:12,616 --> 00:56:16,017
My secret ?
You really want to know ?

556
00:56:18,488 --> 00:56:21,218
Shall I show it
to you right now ?

557
00:56:21,925 --> 00:56:23,722
You really will ?

558
00:56:26,930 --> 00:56:28,727
Closer, please.

559
00:56:31,101 --> 00:56:32,830
A little more...

560
00:56:34,738 --> 00:56:37,502
Yeah... Right there.

561
00:56:48,118 --> 00:56:50,018
Wait !

562
00:56:50,053 --> 00:56:53,511
You apparently still don't
understand your position here.

563
00:56:53,557 --> 00:56:56,860
I can set you
free if you wish.

564
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:59,124
Or I can shut your
loud mouth permanently...

565
00:56:59,162 --> 00:57:01,687
...by having your pretty
little head ripped off !

566
00:57:02,299 --> 00:57:06,759
But, if you do that,
you'll lose the secret forever.

567
00:57:06,803 --> 00:57:08,668
You foolish man.

568
00:57:08,705 --> 00:57:13,199
Don't you know where the power
to create a child is in a woman ?

569
00:57:13,376 --> 00:57:14,400
What ?!

570
00:57:14,544 --> 00:57:19,140
Her heart ! You don't just
make a child with your body !

571
00:57:24,855 --> 00:57:27,881
The love she feels for someone !
The need to protect them !

572
00:57:27,924 --> 00:57:30,586
The need to pass those
feelings on to the future...

573
00:57:30,627 --> 00:57:32,720
...is what makes a child !

574
00:57:38,668 --> 00:57:41,102
You'll never understand that !

575
00:57:43,273 --> 00:57:47,334
It's the software...
Is that it ?

576
00:57:50,747 --> 00:57:52,112
After her !

577
00:58:21,978 --> 00:58:23,912
Who are you ?!

578
00:58:42,999 --> 00:58:44,830
Replicas...?

579
00:58:44,868 --> 00:58:48,235
Do you fakes think you
can beat the original ?!

580
00:59:13,363 --> 00:59:14,762
Mommy !

581
00:59:15,131 --> 00:59:16,291
Yoko !

582
00:59:17,601 --> 00:59:20,502
Mommy !
Mommy, I missed you !

583
00:59:20,537 --> 00:59:22,505
Thank God you're okay...

584
00:59:22,539 --> 00:59:24,336
Mommy, look !

585
00:59:25,475 --> 00:59:28,967
Here ! Your thank-you present
for my birthday party !

586
00:59:31,214 --> 00:59:34,445
It's a ring !
I worked really hard on it !

587
00:59:35,352 --> 00:59:37,946
I wanted to give it to
you as soon as I could.

588
00:59:38,355 --> 00:59:40,448
I see. I'm sorry, hon.

589
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:52,058
What's wrong ?

590
00:59:56,139 --> 00:59:58,107
Th- This is just...!

591
01:00:02,545 --> 01:00:03,842
Yoko !

592
01:00:21,498 --> 01:00:22,658
Naomi...

593
01:00:29,072 --> 01:00:30,596
What are they ?

594
01:00:34,077 --> 01:00:35,772
Naomi, hurry !

595
01:00:37,647 --> 01:00:39,274
- Go without me.
- What ?!

596
01:00:39,316 --> 01:00:42,308
- I'll hold them off here !
- NAOMI !

597
01:01:48,518 --> 01:01:51,646
God dammit !
That know-it-all bastard !

598
01:01:51,688 --> 01:01:54,555
How could he
do that to me ?!

599
01:01:56,826 --> 01:01:59,226
Oh, great. Not again !

600
01:02:24,921 --> 01:02:26,513
Let's see...

601
01:02:29,793 --> 01:02:31,852
Well, let's give
it a try and see.

602
01:03:29,185 --> 01:03:32,677
Looks like this elevator only
runs as high as this floor.

603
01:03:32,722 --> 01:03:35,691
How do we
ride up from here ?!

604
01:03:36,392 --> 01:03:38,326
Daddy, this way !

605
01:03:39,395 --> 01:03:41,920
This way ! We can
go up through here !

606
01:03:42,265 --> 01:03:43,994
Yoko !
Don't go running off !

607
01:03:45,768 --> 01:03:47,668
But we can go up this way !

608
01:03:48,104 --> 01:03:49,571
How do you know that ?

609
01:03:49,606 --> 01:03:51,073
I saw it downstairs !

610
01:03:56,813 --> 01:03:58,804
Doesn't look like
it's coming down.

611
01:04:21,104 --> 01:04:22,696
Someone's behind us.

612
01:04:24,807 --> 01:04:26,001
What ?!

613
01:04:30,914 --> 01:04:31,676
Daddy !

614
01:05:17,961 --> 01:05:18,985
NO ! ! !

615
01:05:26,369 --> 01:05:29,065
What's wrong ?
We're not there yet.

616
01:05:29,272 --> 01:05:31,001
Yoko's in danger...

617
01:05:31,841 --> 01:05:35,106
Please, I want you to release
my combat-mode limiter !

618
01:05:35,144 --> 01:05:37,078
WHAT ?!!

619
01:05:37,113 --> 01:05:39,843
Don't you know what would
happen to your body...

620
01:05:39,882 --> 01:05:43,477
...if you initiated your combat-
mode without the limiter ?!

621
01:05:43,519 --> 01:05:45,885
Your power level would be
mind-blowing, but still....

622
01:05:45,922 --> 01:05:48,584
You'll exceed your internal
battery's output limits...

623
01:05:48,625 --> 01:05:51,685
...and that Class-L heat radiator
system you have inside of you...

624
01:05:51,728 --> 01:05:53,491
...wouldn't be able
to keep up with it !

625
01:05:53,529 --> 01:05:55,520
That lovely skin
you're so proud of...

626
01:05:55,565 --> 01:05:57,533
...would melt down
after only a minute !

627
01:05:57,567 --> 01:06:00,229
In the end, your body itself
will lose all control !

628
01:06:00,270 --> 01:06:03,535
I'm aware of all that !
Please ! There's no time !

629
01:06:05,942 --> 01:06:08,536
Sheesh ! Don't blame me
for what happens !

630
01:06:11,781 --> 01:06:13,009
All clear ?

631
01:06:13,049 --> 01:06:16,619
The password to release your
limiter is " Heaven's Door."

632
01:06:16,619 --> 01:06:18,746
Knock once, and it opens.

633
01:06:18,788 --> 01:06:22,519
But if you push things too far,
you'll end up in Heaven for real !

634
01:06:24,994 --> 01:06:26,689
Anyway, let's go !

635
01:06:45,048 --> 01:06:47,414
Daddy ! Daddy, this way !

636
01:06:47,450 --> 01:06:48,747
R- Right !

637
01:07:10,106 --> 01:07:12,472
Yoko, by any chance...

638
01:07:12,508 --> 01:07:14,877
...did you memorize
the whole floor plan ?

639
01:07:14,877 --> 01:07:16,174
Yeah.

640
01:07:16,212 --> 01:07:17,372
But how ?

641
01:07:17,413 --> 01:07:20,871
I just looked at it. Daddy,
give me a pen, please.

642
01:07:31,294 --> 01:07:33,194
I never realized...

643
01:07:33,229 --> 01:07:35,390
You're a real genius,
aren't you ?

644
01:07:50,446 --> 01:07:51,913
Shit !
It's them again !

645
01:08:16,839 --> 01:08:18,272
- No !
- Yoko !

646
01:08:20,743 --> 01:08:22,074
Stay away...

647
01:08:33,656 --> 01:08:34,179
Mommy...

648
01:08:59,182 --> 01:09:00,171
Naomi !

649
01:09:00,216 --> 01:09:01,979
Get on that one !

650
01:09:05,755 --> 01:09:08,815
- Ross, hurry !
- Right ! Yoko !

651
01:09:34,317 --> 01:09:36,410
Man, this is getting
exciting, isn't it ?

652
01:09:36,452 --> 01:09:39,021
But the real show's
about to start.

653
01:09:39,021 --> 01:09:42,422
And you, my dear Demitrio,
are the star !

654
01:09:45,461 --> 01:09:47,759
I have one more
favor to ask.

655
01:09:47,797 --> 01:09:50,095
What ?! Another one ?!

656
01:09:50,132 --> 01:09:53,363
You copied my
memory data, didn't you ?

657
01:09:53,836 --> 01:09:56,805
There's something I'd
like you to do with it.

658
01:10:02,578 --> 01:10:06,810
She's slick, I'll give her that.
Well, not like I'm one to talk...

659
01:10:06,849 --> 01:10:11,013
Okay, then ! Here we go !
IT'S SHOWTIME !

660
01:10:15,324 --> 01:10:17,815
We interrupt this progam
for a special report.

661
01:10:18,995 --> 01:10:23,295
MGN has successfully
rescued extraodinary footage...

662
01:10:23,332 --> 01:10:27,268
...of the robot uprising which has
become known as the Fist Error.

663
01:10:28,070 --> 01:10:32,006
As this footage shows,
the energyplant was actually...

664
01:10:32,041 --> 01:10:35,135
...a front for illegal
Third Project research.

665
01:10:35,177 --> 01:10:38,510
These shocking scenes
capture the project's failure...

666
01:10:38,548 --> 01:10:41,779
...and the attempt by the ERU,
fearing its disclosure...

667
01:10:41,817 --> 01:10:43,219
...to suppress the truth.

668
01:10:43,219 --> 01:10:45,755
We've also received information
which deeply implicates...

669
01:10:45,755 --> 01:10:46,656

670
01:10:46,656 --> 01:10:48,257
...ERU Executive VP
Demitrio Madini in this affair.

671
01:10:48,257 --> 01:10:49,884

672
01:11:08,811 --> 01:11:11,678
What's wrong ?
It's two against one !

673
01:11:12,515 --> 01:11:14,244
Don't hold back
any longer !

674
01:11:14,417 --> 01:11:17,250
Don't let any of them
off the Earth alive !

675
01:11:57,526 --> 01:11:58,857
Shit !

676
01:12:02,164 --> 01:12:04,155
Yoko ! Hang on tight !

677
01:12:40,136 --> 01:12:41,467
Naomi !

678
01:12:48,711 --> 01:12:50,576
Come on, get on my back.

679
01:12:55,051 --> 01:12:56,814
Hang on as tight
as you can...!

680
01:14:10,359 --> 01:14:12,122
Almost there !

681
01:14:35,918 --> 01:14:38,250
Daddy, we're almost there !

682
01:14:50,332 --> 01:14:54,166
Welcome to the No. 6
Chicago Orbital Elevator...

683
01:14:54,203 --> 01:14:55,898
...your gateway to space !

684
01:15:04,947 --> 01:15:05,845
Naomi !

685
01:15:49,391 --> 01:15:52,690
There's the shuttle !
Come on, let's go !

686
01:15:56,432 --> 01:15:57,626
Yoko.

687
01:16:00,836 --> 01:16:01,734
Yoko...

688
01:16:53,255 --> 01:16:54,620
Get back !

689
01:16:57,059 --> 01:16:58,492
Yoko !

690
01:17:06,101 --> 01:17:07,625
NAOMI !

691
01:17:17,313 --> 01:17:18,075
Naomi...?

692
01:17:22,117 --> 01:17:23,516
God dammit !

693
01:17:34,330 --> 01:17:35,262
Yoko !

694
01:17:39,234 --> 01:17:40,997
Get your hands...

695
01:17:41,070 --> 01:17:42,867
Get your hands off Yoko !

696
01:17:44,340 --> 01:17:45,364
Mommy...

697
01:17:53,282 --> 01:17:54,180
Mommy !

698
01:17:55,484 --> 01:17:56,917
- Mommy !
- Look out !

699
01:18:39,661 --> 01:18:41,322
MOMMY ! ! !

700
01:18:43,899 --> 01:18:45,867
Heaven's...DOOR !

701
01:19:26,842 --> 01:19:31,302
Talk about your simple programs !
" Pursue targets and kill them," huh ?

702
01:19:58,040 --> 01:19:59,701
This is my limit...!

703
01:20:06,982 --> 01:20:07,812
Still... ?!

704
01:20:10,686 --> 01:20:15,555
Dammit... There's no way
I'll be beaten by you !

705
01:20:19,862 --> 01:20:21,420
Mommy !

706
01:20:23,332 --> 01:20:26,665
Mommy ! Stop it, please !

707
01:20:26,969 --> 01:20:27,867
Yoko...

708
01:20:27,903 --> 01:20:32,863
You're hurt so bad...
You're going to die !

709
01:20:56,098 --> 01:20:59,158
GO BACK TO
YOUR MASTER ! ! !

710
01:21:16,885 --> 01:21:18,318
Mommy...!

711
01:21:21,290 --> 01:21:25,852
I broke your ring...
Sorry, hon...

712
01:21:28,564 --> 01:21:32,500
Then... Then I'll make
a ton more for you !

713
01:21:32,534 --> 01:21:33,831
'Kay ?

714
01:21:41,443 --> 01:21:46,403
Mommy, you're
squishing me ! Mommy !

715
01:21:55,524 --> 01:21:58,220
Come on, let's go home.

716
01:22:12,975 --> 01:22:15,068
You think you're
getting away ? !

717
01:22:15,410 --> 01:22:17,469
This vessel is unregistered !

718
01:22:20,015 --> 01:22:22,483
Verify its license number !

719
01:22:25,687 --> 01:22:28,656
Vessel confirmed.
Noncompliant license detected.

720
01:22:28,690 --> 01:22:32,649
Security system engaged. Do you
wish to clear it for takeoff ?

721
01:22:32,694 --> 01:22:35,788
Like hell !
Transfer weapons control to me !

722
01:22:36,798 --> 01:22:40,427
That order requires a
higher security authorization.

723
01:22:40,469 --> 01:22:43,870
This is Demitrio Mardini !
Password is...

724
01:22:45,140 --> 01:22:46,664
Verify !

725
01:22:47,109 --> 01:22:51,239
Confirmed !
Warning ! Warning !

726
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:54,416
Departing unlicensed vessel
cannot be cleared to leave port !

727
01:22:54,416 --> 01:22:57,977
If this warning is ignored,
use of force is authorized !

728
01:23:00,856 --> 01:23:02,915
Now you'll see...

729
01:23:04,826 --> 01:23:06,521
It's you !

730
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:14,896
Wh- Why did you
come back ?

731
01:23:15,070 --> 01:23:17,334
Ready to fire.

732
01:23:26,548 --> 01:23:27,810
Why...?

733
01:23:31,019 --> 01:23:32,577
I told you before.

734
01:23:32,621 --> 01:23:35,021
That if you harmed
my daughter, I'd kill you.

735
01:23:35,524 --> 01:23:39,119
It can't be... Armitage...?!

736
01:24:05,554 --> 01:24:08,284
Please initiate firingmode.

737
01:24:08,323 --> 01:24:10,587
Please initiate firingmode.

738
01:24:23,405 --> 01:24:24,429
See you.

739
01:24:34,716 --> 01:24:37,617
It was announced today that
the government would proceed with...

740
01:24:37,652 --> 01:24:40,587
...the realization of the
Zephyria Terra forming project...

741
01:24:40,622 --> 01:24:43,318
... which had been planned
a while ago but till now...

742
01:24:43,358 --> 01:24:46,327
...had been on hold due to
many points of contention.

743
01:24:46,361 --> 01:24:49,330
This project will involve
the dropping of ice chunks...

744
01:24:49,364 --> 01:24:52,333
...floating in high orbit
around Mars onto its equator...

745
01:24:52,367 --> 01:24:54,198
...in order to form
an artificial ocean.

746
01:25:11,086 --> 01:25:12,246
Come on ! Come on !

747
01:25:12,287 --> 01:25:13,948
Over here !

748
01:25:13,989 --> 01:25:15,616
Whoa ! I'm soaked !

749
01:25:18,026 --> 01:25:19,118
Hey, what about Mommy ?

750
01:25:19,161 --> 01:25:20,958
- Mommy !
- Yeah, splash her !

751
01:25:22,564 --> 01:25:24,156
Hey !

752
01:25:24,199 --> 01:25:26,190
Ooh, now you're
gonna get it !

753
01:25:26,234 --> 01:25:27,269
Come on !

754
01:25:27,269 --> 01:25:30,170
Okay... Now I've got you !
