3
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:50,805
There is a place.

4
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:54,268
A place that knows no sadness.

5
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:59,234
Where even feeling blue is a happy thing.

6
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:05,863
A place inhabited by little blue beings
three apples high.

7
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:12,748
It lies deep in an enchanted forest,
hidden away beyond a medieval village.

8
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:15,918
Most people believe this place is made up,

9
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:20,590
only to be found in books
or in children 's imaginations.

10
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:23,634
Well, we beg to diff en

11
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:27,342
Yeah! Come on, Farmer!

12
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,593
I'm going in!

13
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:37,181
All right, Greedy, I'm gonna race you!

14
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:38,815
Yes!

15
00:01:40,142 --> 00:01:46,866
Whoa, golly! Farm boys love to fly!

16
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,448
Oh, yeah! So excited!

17
00:01:58,035 --> 00:02:01,630
Now you see us, now you don't!

18
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:05,050
Three, two, one. Yeah!

19
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:23,728
Yeah! I love smurf berries! Hey, hey!
The blue ones are mine!

20
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,242
Oh, no! I'm late for rehearsal! I am so late!

21
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:43,419
In Smurf village, each and every Smurf
plays their own special pad.

22
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:46,008
- Whoa, Nellie!
- Sorry, Handy!

23
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:49,178
No problem, Clumsy. You keep me employed!

24
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:51,630
Which gives the Smurfs a sense of harmony.

25
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:54,008
- Hey, Baker! Nice pies!
- No worries, Clumsy.

26
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:56,560
- And tranquility.
- Great sign, guys!

27
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:59,138
- Whether it's Handy Smurf the builder
- I can't stay. Rehearsal time!

28
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,640
- Baker Smurf.
- Hey, Narrator Smurf!

29
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:05,645
Hello, Clumsy! Just rehearsing the intro
for the Blue Moon Festival!

30
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:08,234
- Pizza!
- Pardon me! Pardon me! Hey, Chef Smurf!

31
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,987
Clumsy! Help!

32
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:16,413
I just invented frozen pizzas! Genius!

33
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:18,703
Smurf on the loose!

34
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:20,079
- Hey, Clumsy.
- Hey, guys!

35
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:21,785
- Hi, Jokey!
- Hi, Clumsy.

36
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:24,625
Who's clumsy now, huh?

37
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:27,625
Hey, what do you get when you cross
a Smurf with a cow?

38
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:31,550
Blue cheese! I got you a present.

39
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,972
No, thanks, Jokey. I'm late for rehearsal!

40
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:35,966
But, wait! I...

41
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:41,642
Hey, Grouchy. Hey, Gutsy.

42
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,640
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow your roll, sailor.

43
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:46,314
Hey, wait, wait. Isn't that the rehearsal
for the Blue Moon Festival?

44
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:48,858
What can I say, Clumsy?
You're not on the list.

45
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:50,652
Grouchy, it's right there.

46
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:54,318
Right. Under "Do not let in Clumsy."

47
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,828
Clearly you two
lack the verbal skills required

48
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:58,993
- to explain this predicament succinctly.
- Hey!

49
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:00,661
- Here we go.
- You see, Clumsy,

50
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:04,457
the other Smurfs don't want to dance
with you for fear of what are politely called

51
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,459
"fractures."

52
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:10,213
How could anybody think that?

53
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:12,677
That's gonna leave a big blue bruise.

54
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:19,177
Wonderful! Beautiful! Marvelous.

55
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,012
Watch it, there!

56
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:27,852
Cut! Cut! Cut! It's a dance, not dominoes.

57
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:32,030
- A worry line!
- All right, don't get your petals in a twist.

58
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:35,993
As happy and as perfect
as life in Smurf village is,

59
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:41,073
even sunshine and butterflies
must have their dark clouds.

60
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:45,624
And for all Smurfs,
that dark cloud has one name.

61
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:48,876
Gargamel, the evil wizard.

62
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:53,169
La la la la la la
Sing a happy song

63
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:57,514
La la la la la la
This is so wrong

64
00:04:57,756 --> 00:04:59,554
"I'm Papa Smurf.

65
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:02,302
"I'm the head of a small group of blue people

66
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:06,765
"and live in the forest
with 99 sons and one daughter.

67
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:11,062
"Nothing weird about that, no, no.
Totally normal."

68
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:14,781
"Oh, and I'm Smurfette.
And I think I'm so pretty.

69
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:17,651
"And I betrayed Gargamel,
and I don't even care.

70
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,533
"And everything is just
sunshine and rainbows."

71
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:27,418
But all of that is about to change.

72
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:38,138
I said, "All of that is about to change."
Azrael, that's your cue!

73
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:40,349
That's your cue to
pounce on the miserable beasts

74
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:43,427
in some kind of a rage-induced feline frenzy.

75
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:45,020
Yes, good. Yeah. More rage.

76
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:47,939
Hey, but don't go crazy.
These are the only puppets I have.

77
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:52,519
I am not obsessed with Smurfs, thank you.

78
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:55,355
I simply can't stop thinking about
the miserable beasts

79
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,782
every single minute of every single day.

80
00:05:58,483 --> 00:05:59,985
'Cause I need them!

81
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:04,206
It is only by capturing the little wretches
and extracting their happy blue essence

82
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:07,911
that my magic will finally become...

83
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:10,291
Not infallible.

84
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:14,124
Invincible! Yes. Thank you.

85
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:18,971
I shall become the most powerful wizard
in all of the world.

86
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:31,104
Yeah, but you're milking it. Don't milk it.

87
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:32,399
"O great one?"

88
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:35,649
Yes, lying, deceptive,
horrible little Smurfette?

89
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:40,318
"After all your years of Smurf-less searching,
how ever do you expect to find us?"

90
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,119
I'm very glad you asked, my dear.

91
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:45,788
For, you see, I have a magical map

92
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:48,492
that shows me exactly where
the smurf root grows!

93
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:53,339
I shall now use my formidable powers
to magically transport us here!

94
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:57,342
Come, my little fish-breathed friend!

95
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,135
Alakazoop!

96
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:03,549
Great.

97
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:07,678
Ye gods, Azrael. You're a boy?

98
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:11,648
We really need that Smurf essence.

99
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:13,066
Alakazamp!

100
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,738
Now tie it off right there!

101
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:22,405
That blue moon time of year again.

102
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,907
Time to smurf some magic.

103
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:28,658
Summon a vision
and see what our future holds.

104
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,960
I must get the visioning potion just right.

105
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:35,039
The magic is always strongest
during the blue moon.

106
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:40,177
So far, so good.
Lots of smiles and smurf berries.

107
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:43,596
Clumsy's sitting still. That's always good.

108
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:47,217
A dragon wand.

109
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,596
I got it! I got it!

110
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:52,723
Clumsy.

111
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:58,612
- Help! Save us!
- Papa!

112
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,776
Papa!

113
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:07,491
Clumsy, what have you done?

114
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,574
- Hey, Papa.
- Clumsy?

115
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:12,249
Are you okay?

116
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:15,333
Yes. Fine.

117
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:17,915
Why aren't you rehearsing for
the Blue Moon celebration?

118
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:20,963
You know.
A couple guys got smacked in the face,

119
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:23,337
so I thought I'd make
some smurf root mud packs

120
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:26,640
to take down everyone's swelling.

121
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:30,640
Papa, you're smurf out of smurf root.
I'll go pick some.

122
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:34,431
No! Those fields are too close
to Gargamel's castle.

123
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:35,933
I'll get the smurf root.

124
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:39,186
You stay in the village and out of trouble.
Do you understand?

125
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:42,944
Okay. If you say so.

126
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:48,954
A vision's never been wrong.
I can't let this happen to my Smurfs.

127
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:53,997
"Just stay in the village, Clumsy."

128
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:58,497
Look at all this smurf root.
They are gonna be so proud of me.

129
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:01,633
Let's see, just a few more...

130
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:07,013
- Boo.
- Gargamel!

131
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,643
Help!

132
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:14,479
Good kitty. Good kitty. Look! Look!

133
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:15,980
A ball of yarn!

134
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,099
A nice, juicy bird!

135
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,654
So, that's it!

136
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:26,984
It's invisible.

137
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:30,161
Those sneaky... Wait, wait, wait, wait.

138
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,331
We don't know if it's safe.

139
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,163
Azrael?

140
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:44,175
Are you dead?

141
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:48,388
So, what did you see in your vision, Papa?

142
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:52,260
Nothing apocalyptic, really.

143
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:54,015
Everything's going to be just fine.

144
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:57,769
Perfect. Another year we don't have to
worry about that mean, old...

145
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,691
- Gargamel!
- I know who she meant, Clumsy.

146
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:04,024
No, no! Gargamel!

147
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:07,232
I Gargamel!, kinda, sorta
accidentally led him to the village.

148
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,235
Gargamel!

149
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:13,113
Smurf for your lives!

150
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:15,198
Everybody skedaddle!

151
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:19,661
- Into the forest, Smurfs!
- Come on, Clumsy!

152
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,997
Sound the alarm, Crazy.

153
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,048
This is really bad!

154
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,508
Smurfs, that way!

155
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,545
Hey, cat! Azrael, over here! Come on!

156
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:32,716
There you go, you nasty cat.

157
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:35,010
- This way!
- This is no joke!

158
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:36,766
- Look out!
- Papa!

159
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,738
Let go! Cursed nature!

160
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,743
Here comes papa, Papa!

161
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:08,294
Papa, your primitive little defenses,
they're useless against me, sir!

162
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,678
I laugh at them.

163
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,603
How's that for primitive, Gargamel?

164
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:24,563
Maybe this will all blow over.

165
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:27,111
I can fix this. I just gotta think.

166
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,362
Yes!

167
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:30,027
Follow me, everyone!

168
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:34,285
Save yourselves!

169
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:37,155
Clumsy! You're going the wrong way!

170
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,749
- He's headed for the Forbidden Falls!
- With the blue moon coming?

171
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:42,498
- Quickly, Smurfs! Stop him!
- Unbelievable!

172
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:45,213
The one time we want him to trip
and he's running perfectly!

173
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:47,131
- Clumsy!
- Oh, this is a predicament.

174
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:50,006
"Agony ahead"!
Anybody reading these signs?

175
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:52,428
- This is a predicament!
- This guy's killing me!

176
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:54,426
Looks like we're down to 99 Smurfs!

177
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:56,052
This is not good at all.

178
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,643
Clumsy!

179
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:05,559
Help!

180
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:07,064
Well, we tried. Let's go.

181
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:10,113
Hold on, lad!
We'll form a Smurf bridge to get you.

182
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:11,690
Not the Smurf bridge!

183
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:14,234
- There we go.
- Yeah, pardon me.

184
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:16,991
This is not a Smurf bridge,
it's clearly a chain...

185
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,993
- Smurf it, Brainy!
- Smurf it, Brainy!

186
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:21,458
- The blue moon!
- Oh, dear.

187
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:24,206
- What's happening, Papa?
- What the blinking flip is that?

188
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:25,544
Oh, no!

189
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:28,085
- The vision!
- Come on, guys!

190
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,258
- Pull him up!
- Hurry!

191
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:35,050
- Don't let go!
- Help!

192
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,513
Help!

193
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:38,470
Look out for the hole!

194
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:41,348
No, it's more of a vortex. Of a portal.

195
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,225
Smurf up! It's a hole.

196
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:47,600
Hold on!

197
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,148
Oh, no!

198
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:53,858
Looks like you got
the short end of the stick, eh, Papa?

199
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:57,069
Now you belong to me!

200
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,912
Not this time, Gargamel!

201
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:21,843
What's wrong with you?

202
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:25,976
That was great! Let's have another go.

203
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,854
Are you smurf ed? We almost died in there!

204
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,230
We're not even wet.

205
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,154
What part of the enchanted forest is this?

206
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,152
My calculations indicate...

207
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,279
That's slimy.

208
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,574
I don't think we're in Smurf village any more.

209
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:41,996
Oh, my.

210
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:47,832
- Smurfs? You may Want to take a look at this.
- What is it?

211
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:51,965
Why are we listening to him?
He just got us sucked through a giant hole.

212
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,424
It's not a hole, it's a vortex.

213
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,594
And can't we just go around the rock?

214
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:04,473
Oh, my smurf.

215
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:06,395
Where the smurf are we?

216
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:10,521
Up the smurfing creek without a paddle,
that's where.

217
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,523
Well, at least they're not coming after us.

218
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:15,029
Oh, yeah. Really?

219
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:17,945
- Oh, dear.
- Azrael!

220
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:19,321
- Run!
- Not again!

221
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:23,451
Azrael? Are you dead?

222
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:32,706
Must have Smurfs!

223
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,341
- We'll circle back when it's safe!
- Run!

224
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:41,135
- Guys, come on!
- Go!

225
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:43,091
- Coming through!
- I'm getting hungry!

226
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:45,677
Hey, how are you? Yeah, nice to see you.
Enjoy the party.

227
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:47,474
Hey, can we get
the photographer over there?

228
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:50,648
There's big arrivals happening.
Thanks. Welcome.

229
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:54,694
Hey, ladies, looking good.
A couple quick, quick tips.

230
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:56,734
If you could not stand
directly in front of the display,

231
00:14:56,813 --> 00:15:00,158
but over to the sides,
it'd be a bit more visible. Hey, look, product.

232
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:01,359
Also, don't forget to smile.

233
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:04,655
Remember, you're working for
a cosmetics company. That's it.

234
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,831
- Smile, relax, everyone will have a good time.
- Let's go!

235
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,580
- Thanks. Thank you so much.
- Hurry!

236
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:11,161
Hello, Henri.

237
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:12,996
On top of everything
with the campaign, Patrick?

238
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:14,171
Well, as much as I can be.

239
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:16,750
We certainly did our homework.
We tested the results.

240
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,380
Patrick!

241
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:23,840
- She's pointing at me.
- That can't be good.

242
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:28,227
Odile, it looks fantastic for
Thursday's launch.

243
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:30,263
It's gonna be quite the gala.

244
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:35,068
There he is.
My new vice president of marketing.

245
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:37,771
- So, wait, you fired Ralph?
- His campaign was rubbish.

246
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:41,199
He gave me what I asked for, not what I want.

247
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:43,443
Can you give me what I want?

248
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:45,028
Is that what you're asking for?

249
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:48,365
How would I know what I'm asking for
when I don't even know what I want?

250
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:51,497
Well said, Odile. Well said.
That's why you need me.

251
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:55,251
Exacto! I need you to create
a new campaign for Jouvenel.

252
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:59,092
All digital, of course,
so it can be ready on time for the launch.

253
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,878
Odile, that's two days.

254
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:05,591
Sí mi corazón, and it mustn't be delayed.
Is that going to be a problem?

255
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:08,343
No. No, I mean for a whole new campaign,
it's kind of tight.

256
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:10,303
But... No, two days is perfect.

257
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:12,104
God only needed six days
for the whole world, right?

258
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:15,608
Fail me, and maybe you can
go and work for him.

259
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:23,650
Where are we, Azrael?

260
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:29,489
What manner of freakish realm is this?

261
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,957
Okay, one more box of research.
Hey, would you get a cab for me, please?

262
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:36,795
Yes, yes, of course.

263
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:38,790
This day just keeps getting better and better.

264
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:41,839
So we're just gonna jump in the portal,
get back to our village

265
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:43,261
and everybody's happy, right?

266
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:45,555
Yeah, guys. Let's stay smurftimistic.

267
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,883
You know what?
I choose to be pessismurfstic.

268
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,217
We're all gonna die.

269
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,679
Papa Smurf, how do we get home
with the portal closed?

270
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:55,390
I'm sure when the blue moon rises tonight,

271
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:57,271
the portal will open again.

272
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,273
Now, let's take shelter till dark.

273
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,108
All right, let's get smurfing.

274
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:03,281
Okay, but I'm not happy.

275
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,320
- Azrael!
- Run, Smurfs!

276
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:06,693
- Take that!
- Guys, come on!

277
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:09,279
- Quick, to the tree!
- Let's go!

278
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:14,284
- Smurfette!
- My hair! Get back, cat!

279
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:18,458
Way to go, Smurfette!

280
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,295
- Oh, no!
- Take one for the team, Clumsy!

281
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,797
- Help!
- Clumsy, look out!

282
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,303
Smurf!

283
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,508
- Clumsy!
- Oh, no!

284
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:31,634
Hey.

285
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,353
- Clumsy!
- What a numptie.

286
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:37,015
- Quickly, to the mechanical wagon.
- Up the tree, Smurfs.

287
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,982
Why don't we just go around the tree?

288
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:41,978
There you are. By all means,

289
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:45,739
relax here in the fresh air and the sunshine
while my missing Smurfs could be anywhere.

290
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:48,527
What? Where?

291
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:50,153
Come on! Try and stay with me, Smurfs.

292
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:52,534
- I'm getting too old for this.
- Slow down!

293
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:54,081
Be careful, Brainy.

294
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,124
Hey. Hey!

295
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,168
Seventh Street, from First and A, please.

296
00:17:58,661 --> 00:17:59,958
- Come on, Smurfs!
- I don't like these heights.

297
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:02,335
- Don't look down.
- Come back here, wretched Smurfs!

298
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:03,758
- Hurry!
- We're way up here!

299
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:06,586
A jump from this height
will Knock the blue out of us!

300
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:08,091
- My hip.
- Papa!

301
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,387
- Gargamel!
- Oh, dear.

302
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:10,848
- Stop that carriage!
- Let's go! Let's go!

303
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:13,017
- Wait, wait. I forgot my phone.
- Come back! Stop there!

304
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,561
Stop that carriage!

305
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:17,012
Never mind. Here it is.

306
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:19,190
Knock yourself out, Gargamel!

307
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,442
You've had that coming for about 30 years!

308
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:22,769
Smurfs!

309
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,696
Oh, wow.

310
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:41,371
Castles and palaces everywhere!

311
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:44,461
- And green goblins!
- And red trolls.

312
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,718
And look at the giant princess!

313
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:52,636
This village is amazing, Papa.

314
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:55,468
Yes, and likely very dangerous.

315
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,895
Until we rescue Clumsy and get back home,

316
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:01,816
I need you all to stay close
and do exactly as I say.

317
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:03,939
- Smurf's honor.
- If you say so.

318
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,152
You can count on us, Papa.

319
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,571
They can see us! Camouflage.

320
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,232
Blend in.

321
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:25,835
Well, I guess this is our stop. Let's go.

322
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:28,464
We get to climb another tree.

323
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:31,011
Watch out, watch out.
Hang on, everybody. Hang on!

324
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:32,680
- Brainy.
- That's it.

325
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:36,801
- Thanks a lot. Have a good night.
- I hope Clumsy can breathe in that box.

326
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:39,558
How are we supposed to
find Clumsy in there?

327
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:41,890
- I could attempt to smurf the probability...
- Brainy!

328
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:44,521
- We'll look through every window.
- I don't do windows.

329
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,568
- Now, let's get smurfing.
- You heard him. Come on.

330
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:49,113
- Every window?
- Piece of cake.

331
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:51,907
- Grace?
- Hello?

332
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:54,485
Guess what? Guess what, guess what?

333
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:58,410
Okay. They invented a zero-calorie pizza.

334
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:01,163
- No, but that's a good idea.
- Yes. They found...

335
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,002
Baby kicked.

336
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,540
- Hi.
- Hi.

337
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:08,916
Please say hello.

338
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:19,722
- Please.
- Hello, little Sea-Monkey.

339
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:22,855
This is the sound of my voice.

340
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:26,939
Hello, son or daughter. Hello.

341
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,695
Hello.

342
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,986
That is not the sound of your voice.
That is the voice of a robot.

343
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,613
Our child is gonna be attached to the toaster.

344
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:37,821
Or the new VP of marketing.

345
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:41,954
No. No! Oh, my goodness! Oh, my gosh!

346
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:43,124
- It's...
- It's provisional.

347
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:46,246
If I wow Cruella de Odile,
then I'll keep the job.

348
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:49,502
If not, then my head'll be on a pike
next to the last guy.

349
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,009
Well, wow you will! You wowed me.

350
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,631
But I have two days.

351
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,838
- Yikes.
- I know.

352
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:58,015
What if I don't get them done in time?

353
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,058
Oh, HO, you can't come to the ultrasound.

354
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:03,975
Unless...

355
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:06,933
Wait, the backup ads we have
did fine in focus groups.

356
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:09,860
I could retool those.
I'd have to work around the clock.

357
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:16,526
Azrael, we've come so far,

358
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:20,785
yet ever am I haunted by
the same familiar riddle.

359
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,910
How to find the Smurfs?

360
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:27,416
If only I...

361
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:31,549
I'm sorry, is my thinking
interrupting your vile hacking?

362
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:35,970
If only I had something of theirs.
A drop of spittle. A fingernail.

363
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:41,389
Some hair, even.
Then I could make some Smurf magic.

364
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:46,597
Very nice. Are you done now?

365
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,064
I don't want to look at it.

366
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:51,439
What? What?

367
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:58,360
Is that... No. No, it can't be.

368
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,244
It is.

369
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:04,657
The tawny locks of Smurfette.

370
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:13,125
Sweet follicular ambrosia!
Silky strands of joy.

371
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:17,094
Mixed with a fair amount of cat vomit.

372
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:22,596
Yes. Yes, I am a genius!

373
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:27,639
With my skills, even this small trifle
of smurfiness

374
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:31,233
will yield me just enough power
to catch them all!

375
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:38,571
I must find a laboratory with which to tease
the magic from these precious little strands.

376
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:48,201
Yes. it's a bit small,
but this should do nicely!

377
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,458
It's even got its own cauldron.

378
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,508
What died in here?

379
00:22:57,877 --> 00:23:00,175
Open. Open. Open. Open. Open!

380
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:09,223
Somebody's been working a dark
and terrible magic in there.

381
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:18,902
What is that?

382
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:38,463
On, baby.

383
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,923
Daddy is home.

384
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:46,763
Come on.

385
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:50,392
Papa, I'm familiar with 613 shades of blue,

386
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:52,348
- and that moon is not one of them.
- Papa?

387
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:57,153
Stay calm, everyone.
If the portal opened once, it can open again.

388
00:23:57,227 --> 00:24:01,107
How are we gonna open a magical portal
when we can't even find Clumsy?

389
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:02,783
Hey, I think I see something up there.

390
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:32,225
Oh, no.

391
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:46,110
Clumsy? Is that you?

392
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:47,786
Hello.

393
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,449
Help! Help!

394
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:58,914
Oh, smurf.

395
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,301
Hey.

396
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:12,557
"Berry Boom."

397
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:39,462
Patrick!

398
00:25:57,014 --> 00:25:59,016
Elway. Elway.

399
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:01,693
I'm sure this is the box.
When I get my hands on him...

400
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:03,066
- Someone's coming!
- Smurfs!

401
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:04,237
What is it?

402
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,324
No, no!

403
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:12,079
No, no, no, no. Come on, come on, come on.
Please, please.

404
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:13,781
Elway.

405
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:17,535
Elway. Did you do that?

406
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:19,836
- Come on, put a little smurf into it.
- Hang on, Clumsy.

407
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:21,710
- I got this side.
- All together now.

408
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:23,416
- Crikey.
- Oh, dear.

409
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:26,964
- Now what, lads?
- What happened to Clumsy?

410
00:26:27,044 --> 00:26:28,717
- I bet they ate him. Let's go home.
- Hide.

411
00:26:28,796 --> 00:26:31,424
GO! Pull the lid!

412
00:26:37,054 --> 00:26:38,271
Gross.

413
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:44,402
This is so...

414
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:03,463
- That's Clumsy!
- Charge, Smurfs! Charge!

415
00:27:03,831 --> 00:27:05,754
- Out of the way, big guy.
- Clumsy, we're coming!

416
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:06,925
Excuse me. Pardon me.

417
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,094
- This is for Clumsy!
- Wait for me!

418
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,213
- Oh, God!
- Please don't hurt me!

419
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,803
- Please, I just want to go home!
- Are you...

420
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,394
Did you just talk?

421
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:22,232
I'm not saying till you put down
the giant spiky thing.

422
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:23,775
- Clumsy!
- Clumsy, where are you?

423
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:25,444
- Make yourself known!
- Smurf us a sign!

424
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:27,362
- Come out, Clumsy!
- Smurf out, smurf out, wherever you are.

425
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:29,280
- Are you there?
- Come to my voice, laddie!

426
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:30,778
- Where are you?
- Can you hear us?

427
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:33,327
- Get out of here!
- Look out!

428
00:27:33,694 --> 00:27:36,413
- Too much aggression!
- Go back to the sewers!

429
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:37,785
Kiss my smurf!

430
00:27:37,865 --> 00:27:41,165
You all find clumsy! The giant is mine!

431
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,454
- Over here!
- Get him!

432
00:27:43,537 --> 00:27:45,881
Have you had enough? Tap out?

433
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:50,382
Okay, so you're like... You're blue, and...

434
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:53,844
- Oh, gosh, are you okay?
- Quickly!

435
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:55,174
- This way! This way!
- Follow me, Smurfs!

436
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:57,259
- Clumsy! Where are you?
- Look out!

437
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:58,636
Other way! Other way!

438
00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:00,187
- Run, Smurfs!
- Come on!

439
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:01,892
Run!

440
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:03,975
Elway!

441
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:06,401
- Smurf for your lives!
- Clumsy, where the smurf are you?

442
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:08,946
- Stinky breath.
- Spread out!

443
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:11,823
Grace! Run!

444
00:28:11,982 --> 00:28:16,203
Stop bleating like a sheep
and let me hog-tie you, you wriggly numptie.

445
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:18,451
Grace, we're being attacked!

446
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,124
Do not be fooled by their cuteness!

447
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:23,578
It's okay, it's okay.

448
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:27,794
They're friendly.

449
00:28:28,332 --> 00:28:30,209
You're lucky your lassie stepped in.

450
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:33,387
I was about to make haggis
with your innards.

451
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:45,061
This is it. This is it, Azrael!

452
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:49,274
Smurfette's hair goes in here,
flows through the Smurf essence extractor,

453
00:28:49,353 --> 00:28:51,776
and finally, I have my Smurfilator!

454
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:56,277
It's the pièce de résistance. The crème de la...

455
00:28:57,402 --> 00:29:00,155
Would you care for a mint when you're done?

456
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:02,992
Yes, yes, yes!

457
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,918
With this precious elixir,

458
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:11,842
my sorcerous spell shall be powerful
beyond all measurable measurement.

459
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:20,677
This one tiny drop will give me
the power to capture them all.

460
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:32,487
This is great!

461
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:36,443
La la la la la la
Smurf the whole day long

462
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:40,783
Next time you're feeling blue
Just let a smile begin

463
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:45,208
Happy things will come to you
So Smurf yourself a grin

464
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:47,878
It's so obvious
that what you're doing is wrong.

465
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:49,421
Oh, really? After you.

466
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:50,918
How crazy is this?

467
00:29:50,998 --> 00:29:54,218
There are little blue people
singing in our kitchen!

468
00:29:57,462 --> 00:30:00,682
So you're sticking with your
"this is actually happening" theory?

469
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:02,384
Sorry.

470
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:07,390
Okay. It says here Smurfs are
mythical creatures from Belgium,

471
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,566
- also known as Schtroumpfs...
- Yeah.

472
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:11,477
Documented by Peyo.

473
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:15,898
Also says that they bring good luck.
Like leprechauns to the Irish.

474
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:18,404
It says they're mythical, Grace.

475
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,489
- I'm so sorry, Master Winslow.
- That was great.

476
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:22,071
Well, they look pretty real to me.

477
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:23,572
Come on.

478
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:29,752
- Excuse me.
- Okay, to review.

479
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:34,334
You guys come from a magic forest
where you live in oversized mushrooms.

480
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:36,506
- Yes.
- You're being chased by an evil wizard.

481
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:38,007
- Yeah.
- And you're trapped in New York

482
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:39,713
- until there's a blue moon...
- Very good.

483
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:42,675
And you like to use the
extremely imprecise term "smurf"

484
00:30:42,758 --> 00:30:44,931
- for just about everything.
- Smurfxactly.

485
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:50,015
And you're all
named after your personalities?

486
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:53,652
Do you get your names when you're born,
or after you've exhibited certain traits?

487
00:30:53,727 --> 00:30:54,899
- Yeah.
- Yep.

488
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:56,230
Yeah, whatever.

489
00:30:56,313 --> 00:30:59,487
Master Winslow, there must be
something about the blue moon

490
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:01,193
on your magic window machine.

491
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:04,075
Just what is this magic searching device?

492
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:05,910
Right now, I'm using Google.

493
00:31:07,908 --> 00:31:09,876
- Google.
- Google.

494
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:17,301
Okay. "Blue moon.
A full moon that occurs twice in one month.

495
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:19,049
"A figurative construct..."

496
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:21,054
- Much like yourselves.
- Hey!

497
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:23,928
"But the moon itself
doesn't appear to be blue."

498
00:31:24,091 --> 00:31:25,343
- What?
- Not blue?

499
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:27,143
- Perfect!
- Now we'll never get home!

500
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:31,269
No cause for alarm, my little Smurfs.
If we're to open the portal home,

501
00:31:31,348 --> 00:31:33,191
I'll just have to smurf us a potion

502
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:34,643
to invoke the blue moon.

503
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,069
You hear that, honey?

504
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:38,567
They're only staying till
an actual blue moon rises.

505
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:42,200
Which could happen if the little blue
Santa man makes a magic potion,

506
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:44,994
which, at this point,
seems completely plausible.

507
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,743
- Want a bite?
- No, thank you.

508
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:50,543
Of course, the stars will
need to be perfectly aligned.

509
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:55,088
And when that might be is hard to determine
without the proper instrument.

510
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:58,000
Master Winslow,
might I borrow your stargazer?

511
00:31:58,083 --> 00:31:59,175
My what-whatzer?

512
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:02,087
He doesn't have a Stargazer. Do you?

513
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:05,014
- This is all my fault.
- We're all gonna die.

514
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:07,843
- We're all gonna die!
- Smurf out of it, scaredy-brains!

515
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,394
- One Panicky Smurf is enough!
- Hey!

516
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:13,558
Besides, Papa had a vision,
and everything turns out smurf y.

517
00:32:13,807 --> 00:32:15,059
Right, Papa?

518
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:21,399
Yes, yes. It all turns out just fine.

519
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:29,828
We must find this Smurf thief.
Stop your complaining.

520
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:31,908
If I were a Smurf, where would I go?

521
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,420
You there, you there. Fancy pants.
Have you seen any little blue men?

522
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:38,044
- Absolutely. What price are we talking about?
- You're selling them?

523
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:40,217
- Have you looked in the drawer, sweetie?
- Wait, what drawer?

524
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:42,795
- In the kitchen, Lilly.
- Who is this Lilly?

525
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:45,301
Are you kidding?
She's the hottest girl in my department.

526
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,599
Please, please. Please, young woodsman.

527
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:52,100
What does the temperature of this Lilly
have to do with the finding of Smurfs?

528
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:54,773
- Take your meds, man.
- What?

529
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:58,773
Is everyone in this realm completely insane?

530
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:03,778
Thank the gods, a local wizard. Excellent.

531
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:06,030
Pardon me, wise sir?

532
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:08,362
By any chance, have you seen
any little blue men?

533
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,661
They're everywhere!

534
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,834
I knew it. I knew it!
I told you we were close, Azrael.

535
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:16,494
I know.

536
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:21,550
Now, just take one, everybody.
We have to make sure our smurf berries last.

537
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:23,969
Great. We're gonna be here how long?

538
00:33:24,044 --> 00:33:26,547
Not long. First, we have to get a Stargazer.

539
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:29,891
Next, find a book of spells
and then smurf a portal

540
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:33,391
and we're home.
Very simple, my little Smurfs.

541
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:35,097
Bye, Elway.

542
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,478
Someone looks smurfalish!

543
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:39,730
- Why you wearing a leash?
- It's a tie.

544
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:42,062
- Does it keep your neck warm?
- No.

545
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:45,865
Clearly, it functions as an aid in his craft,
like a blacksmith's apron.

546
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:48,160
I wear it because it's what
everyone wears at work.

547
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,362
What are you, you pasty giant?

548
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:54,621
I try to get people to buy things
by analyzing market trend predictions.

549
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:58,454
Predictions! He's a fortune teller.

550
00:33:58,537 --> 00:34:01,086
Look, I would love to explain
but I am super late. I gotta go.

551
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:03,258
- I really don't have time for this.
- What?

552
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:05,047
You had one outfit on,

553
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:08,130
and now you're wearing something
completely different.

554
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:09,510
- Yeah. It...
- Now, Smurfette,

555
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:11,717
she probably got the other one dirty.

556
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,643
- Let's not embarrass her.
- Sorry.

557
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:16,096
Thanks for letting us stay in your mushroom,
Miss Grace.

558
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:20,104
- It's really nice.
- Well, thank you. I'm glad you like it.

559
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:24,905
I like our little mushroom, too. But you know,
somebody wants a bigger mushroom.

560
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,824
But, then you'd be further apart.

561
00:34:27,983 --> 00:34:31,112
You said it, sister. Okay, I've gotta go.
I've got an appointment.

562
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:32,867
I've got a baby on the way, so...

563
00:34:32,946 --> 00:34:36,291
Wait, wait. We can't just
leave them here alone, without an adult.

564
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:39,620
I'm 546 years old.

565
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:41,250
Of course you are.

566
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:42,876
- They'll be fine. They'll be fine.
- All right.

567
00:34:42,956 --> 00:34:45,129
- Love you.
- Okay.

568
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,093
- Bye. Bye.
- Bye, Grace! Goodbye.

569
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,512
By the way, I wouldn't go anywhere
if I were you.

570
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:50,922
Why not?

571
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:55,473
Our world doesn't do well
with visitors from other places.

572
00:34:55,552 --> 00:34:57,270
I mean, look what happened to E.T.

573
00:34:58,263 --> 00:35:00,766
It's a movie. A moving picture.

574
00:35:01,141 --> 00:35:03,269
Book. Just stay, okay?

575
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:07,530
Great. He's gone
and we still don't have a Stargazer.

576
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:11,782
Wait a smurf. If he's a fortune teller,
he reads stars all the time.

577
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:15,160
Ergo, it's at his place of business.

578
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:16,994
Excellent work, Brainy.

579
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:19,041
What are we waiting for? Let's ride.

580
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,960
- Yeah, come on, guys.
- Hey, stop it.

581
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:23,789
- Come on, Smurfs!
- Let's go get that Stargazer.

582
00:35:25,165 --> 00:35:27,293
- Surprise, surprise.
- Oh, no.

583
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:31,050
Clumsy, I think it might be best

584
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:33,223
if you stay here. You know?

585
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:35,804
Smurf an eye on the mushroom.

586
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:42,604
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

587
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,235
- This way, Smurfs!
- Let's follow Mr. Winslow.

588
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:47,904
Well, I can smurf an eye on the mushroom.

589
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,697
Smurf away!

590
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:51,946
- Let's smurf this joint.
- Is he down there?

591
00:35:52,025 --> 00:35:53,242
- Taxi!
- Can you see him?

592
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:55,741
Look, he's getting into
the mechanical wagon.

593
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,322
- Oh, no.
- Clearly that distance is too great...

594
00:35:57,405 --> 00:36:00,079
- Off you go!
- No! Gutsy!

595
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,081
Come on, Smurfs! Smurfabunga!

596
00:36:02,202 --> 00:36:03,954
Goodbye, blue world.

597
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:05,755
Use your hat, you ninny!

598
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:08,921
Couldn't we just have taken the stairs?

599
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,423
- There we go.
- Not funny, Gutsy.

600
00:36:12,462 --> 00:36:14,510
- It was a little funny.
- Smurfs.

601
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,638
We're stopping. Hold on tight.

602
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:19,060
Not to me, Grouchy.

603
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:21,638
Oh, did I do that? Sorry.

604
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:23,815
- Keep the change.
- Thanks, man.

605
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:26,522
Master Winslow, we really need your help.

606
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:27,727
- Hey.
- Right here.

607
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:28,983
What are you doing here?

608
00:36:29,062 --> 00:36:32,862
What part of "we need a Stargazer"
don't you understand, you numptie?

609
00:36:33,066 --> 00:36:36,616
- You can't be out in public.
- Who are you talking to?

610
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:40,123
If we could just have a quick look around
in your predicting parlor...

611
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,292
- We really wanna go home.
- Come on, man, I gotta go.

612
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:44,495
- Fine. Just come here, come here.
- Please, please.

613
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,212
All of you. Trust me.

614
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:48,006
Careful. Hey, watch the smurf berries.

615
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:50,504
I'm not going... Hey!

616
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:52,711
- Be quiet.
- It's dark in here.

617
00:36:52,794 --> 00:36:54,137
All right, who smurf ed?

618
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:57,011
Hey! Get your hand out of my kilt.

619
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:59,934
- That's not my hand.
- Hey, ticklish.

620
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:04,981
- Morning. Morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Winslow.

621
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,058
- Congratulations on your promotion.
- Thank you.

622
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:09,236
I hope you guys like desk drawers,
because that's where...

623
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,529
- You're late.
- Odile!

624
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:13,439
You were in my office.

625
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:16,526
It's my building,
and we have much work to do.

626
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:19,783
The launch for Jouvenel is tomorrow night.
Is your concept ready?

627
00:37:19,863 --> 00:37:22,707
Close. I had a crazy morning.

628
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:24,914
What are you doing?

629
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:29,289
Nothing. I'm excited.
I'm excited about all the concept ideas.

630
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:34,173
And hungry. Sorry. Hungry for its success.

631
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:35,795
Nervous energy.

632
00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:37,927
Nervous energy's what's going on up in here.

633
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:39,223
- I like it.
- Yep.

634
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:43,224
- The fear of failure is a fabulous motivator.
- True that.

635
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:45,559
Hey! Stop it.

636
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:48,391
- Henri.
- Make it work.

637
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:50,401
You have no idea.

638
00:37:50,727 --> 00:37:52,821
- What is this?
- Why did I get the armpit?

639
00:37:52,896 --> 00:37:56,446
- Stop pushing me.
- Go easy on the cologne tomorrow.

640
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,401
Are you crazy?

641
00:37:58,485 --> 00:38:00,362
- You're gonna get me fired.
- My hair!

642
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:03,699
I couldn't even breathe in there.
It smelled like the business end of a sheep.

643
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:05,125
- I don't see a Stargazer.
- How you doing?

644
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,125
I'm sorry, Master Winslow,
but we badly need to borrow your Stargazer.

645
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:12,925
I don't have a Stargazer, okay?

646
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:17,550
It's not something people of this century
just have, especially here.

647
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:21,600
- Not happy.
- Now if you'll excuse me, I have to work.

648
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:25,179
Well, perhaps we could sing
to help things along.

649
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:28,561
And then we'll get the stargazer.
Come along, Smurfs.

650
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,985
La la la la la la
Sing a happy song

651
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:34,608
La la la la la la
Smurf the whole day long

652
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:36,697
Stop.

653
00:38:36,773 --> 00:38:38,116
La la la la la la

654
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:39,325
Stop!

655
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,323
Sing a happy song

656
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:44,497
Come on. None of you find that song
just the tiniest bit annoying?

657
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:46,040
I find it annoying.

658
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:48,956
Well, what do you sing at work?

659
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:51,333
- I don't sing at work.
- What?

660
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:53,414
- And you have to wear a leash.
- Harsh.

661
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:55,751
I know. How about if we hum?

662
00:38:58,503 --> 00:38:59,595
Please stop humming.

663
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:07,804
I need to hone my message here.

664
00:39:07,971 --> 00:39:09,143
I've got a message.

665
00:39:09,222 --> 00:39:13,068
"Always chew with your mouth closed."
Papa taught us that.

666
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:15,019
That's good. You should use that.

667
00:39:15,103 --> 00:39:17,071
Or, "Dance and be happy."

668
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:19,114
How about, "Grab life by the grapes"?

669
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:22,285
- "Turn that frown upside down."
- "Always bet on blue."

670
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,739
- "Have a smurf y day."
- "I kissed a Smurf and I liked it"?

671
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:29,242
It's an embarrassment of riches.

672
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:30,702
They're giving you gold here.

673
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,753
- Thank you.
- Master Winslow,

674
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:36,333
you'll know it's the right message
if it comes from the heart.

675
00:39:36,416 --> 00:39:37,713
- Right, Smurfs?
- Yeah.

676
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,044
- You said it.
- Absolutely.

677
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:41,346
- Of course.
- Welcome to my world.

678
00:39:46,134 --> 00:39:49,104
I love emerging dramatically
through the smoke.

679
00:39:50,972 --> 00:39:56,900
It makes... It makes me feel
so deliciously mysterious.

680
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:01,324
Also, it gives the skin a wonderful glow.

681
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:02,650
What?

682
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:04,076
Where? Where?

683
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,451
What?

684
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:13,203
Curses! So close.

685
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:15,334
What?

686
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:20,426
Theirs is upside-down.

687
00:40:20,627 --> 00:40:23,881
Idiots. They painted it wrong. Come, Azrael.

688
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:26,056
- Hi.
- Hello.

689
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:27,179
What are you doing?

690
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,602
Just greening things up a bit.

691
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:33,398
That's so sweet. That's very sweet but,

692
00:40:33,473 --> 00:40:36,022
you know, I'm not so sure
this stuffs gonna grow out here.

693
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,730
We'll see. Smurfs have a very blue thumb.

694
00:40:40,313 --> 00:40:41,860
So where is everybody else?

695
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,567
They went to get a Stargazer

696
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:45,948
so Papa can smurf a blue moon
to get us home.

697
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:47,279
And they went without you?

698
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:50,286
Yeah. I mean, who knows why?

699
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:54,453
- Hey!
- Sorry!

700
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:56,166
Why don't we come inside?

701
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:59,089
- Smurfs, where are you?
- Make sure to demonstrate that

702
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:01,213
this new anti-aging cream can make

703
00:41:01,668 --> 00:41:06,890
any woman look beautiful, young, vibrant.
It's almost magical.

704
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:09,093
Astonishing, really.

705
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:14,521
I see no transformation.

706
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:16,975
- Your potion has no power.
- Excuse me?

707
00:41:17,058 --> 00:41:19,902
Well, she's still an eye-offending dogfish,
if you ask me.

708
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:23,403
- Sir!
- This is my mother who you're speaking of.

709
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:26,068
I'm so sorry. I didn't realize.

710
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,777
How sad for you in 30 years.

711
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:30,997
Henri, escort this lunatic out.

712
00:41:31,072 --> 00:41:32,324
- "Lunatic"?
- Security!

713
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:35,035
I am the great and powerful Gargamel!

714
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:39,089
"Lunatic." Could a lunatic do this?

715
00:41:39,247 --> 00:41:41,796
Alakazootiful!

716
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:57,849
How did you do that?

717
00:41:58,016 --> 00:42:00,144
Yes, and seriously, me next.

718
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:04,822
So sorry, but lunatics and great wizards
never reveal their secrets.

719
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:09,656
Come, Azrael! Now, where are my Smurfs?

720
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:11,404
No, no, no, no, no. Don't go.

721
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:14,198
- I need to know what you just did.
- Not telling.

722
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:17,497
Please, señor Can you do that again?

723
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:21,339
You may attempt to persuade me.

724
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:25,050
What is it that you desire?

725
00:42:25,835 --> 00:42:27,462
Riches?

726
00:42:28,755 --> 00:42:29,802
Fame?

727
00:42:31,132 --> 00:42:32,179
Fortune?

728
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:34,886
With my help,

729
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:41,609
the whole world
will know the name that is Garbagesmell.

730
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:44,691
Gargamel.

731
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:52,158
Yes. With my help, the whole world
will know the genius that is Gargamel.

732
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:55,865
L.m

733
00:42:57,658 --> 00:43:02,459
I'm sorry. Did you just say "genius"?

734
00:43:03,623 --> 00:43:07,048
So, even though
I'm what you might call accident-prone,

735
00:43:07,168 --> 00:43:10,297
on the bright side, I did
land us all here in your little mushroom,

736
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:11,973
and we got to meet you and Patrick.

737
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:15,515
You're so sweet. And I know how you feel.
I'm so clumsy, too.

738
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:17,603
Well, I used to be.

739
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:19,139
- Really?
- Yeah.

740
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:22,350
So how long did it take you to...

741
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:25,565
Gosh.

742
00:43:25,645 --> 00:43:27,818
Un-fumble your feet?

743
00:43:28,898 --> 00:43:33,654
Well, about as long as it takes to realize
that nobody's just one thing.

744
00:43:34,821 --> 00:43:36,368
You can be anything you wanna be.

745
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:40,876
- "Hero Smurf."
- Yeah.

746
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:43,545
Probably not.

747
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,884
- Hey, Brainy, help me figure this out.
- Let me show you.

748
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,593
First, you put your...

749
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:51,963
Works every time.

750
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:54,515
La la la la la la
Sing a happy song

751
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:58,060
This is a fascinating wind machine
you have here.

752
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:06,227
- Hi, Patrick.
- Grace, help. Help!

753
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:09,063
They are everywhere
and they won't stop singing.

754
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:12,783
I cannot get a thing done.
Please come and get these guys.

755
00:44:15,987 --> 00:44:17,705
Señor Gargamel, I'll be frank.

756
00:44:17,947 --> 00:44:24,045
Clinique, Lancôme, MAC. They will kill
to get what you have in that ring.

757
00:44:24,245 --> 00:44:25,747
Not if we Kill them first.

758
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:30,460
Let's see, we're going to need some knights,
preferably in shining armor,

759
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,588
some bowmen, poison arrows.

760
00:44:34,255 --> 00:44:35,632
I like the way you think.

761
00:44:35,715 --> 00:44:37,513
And some spikes to mount their heads on.

762
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:39,180
Well, it is all about the presentation.

763
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:43,231
And, of course, all of our testing
would be animal cruelty-free?

764
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:46,225
What, they pay extra for the animal cruelty?
Is that it?

765
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:47,647
Get out of here.

766
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:53,449
You have a wicked sense of humor.

767
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:55,526
- We like that, don't we?
- Hey, out of here!

768
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:56,827
Henri?

769
00:44:57,445 --> 00:44:58,662
I said, get out of here.

770
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:03,076
Señor Gargamel,
now you must assure me, darling,

771
00:45:03,326 --> 00:45:07,081
that you can recreate whatever it was
that you did to my mother,

772
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:09,336
but on a massive scale.

773
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:13,336
Do that, and the world will worship you.

774
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:15,922
- Did you hear that, Azrael?
- Yeah.

775
00:45:16,297 --> 00:45:23,397
"Worship." Oh, it rolls off the tongue
like flesh from a... Not pilgrim...

776
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:26,519
Heretic. Yes, thank you.

777
00:45:27,934 --> 00:45:30,733
Thank the gods, a chamber pot.

778
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:35,153
This swill that you call Dom Pérignon
has gone straight to my nether regions.

779
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:49,168
Here, toss this out the window, yeah?
Today, please.

780
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:52,959
Now, to the matter at hand.

781
00:45:53,793 --> 00:45:55,466
So do we have a deal, señor?

782
00:45:57,088 --> 00:45:59,386
Not quite, my sweet maiden.

783
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:05,188
You see, first I must have my Smurfs.

784
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:11,816
You guys just have to understand that
Patrick's under a lot of pressure right now.

785
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:13,988
So if you could just lay low for a little bit...

786
00:46:14,063 --> 00:46:17,658
You have my word of honor, Miss Grace.
My Smurfs will not move from this bag.

787
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:19,406
- Okay, good.
- Stargazer!

788
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:21,787
- What?
- Stargazer! Let's go!

789
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:23,079
- Everybody out! Come on!
- No, no, no!

790
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:24,247
- Guys, let's go!
- No, no, no, no, no!

791
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:26,367
- Full Smurf ahead.
- No, wait, wait!

792
00:46:26,701 --> 00:46:27,793
Hit the deck!

793
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,913
Hey, I'm walking here! I'm walking!

794
00:46:30,997 --> 00:46:32,749
- Save me!
- Hey, look out, Brainy.

795
00:46:32,832 --> 00:46:34,425
Can't everyone just slow down

796
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:35,592
- and enjoy life?
- Get off me. Get off!

797
00:46:35,668 --> 00:46:36,715
Wait for it.

798
00:46:37,086 --> 00:46:38,463
I gotta get me one of those.

799
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:39,846
Oh, my gosh!

800
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:41,640
- Hey, lady! Hey!
- Wait, wait. Hold on!

801
00:46:41,716 --> 00:46:45,596
When we get inside, spread out
and find that Stargazer.

802
00:46:45,678 --> 00:46:46,850
Come on, Smurfs!

803
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,288
- Hey.
- Patrick, the Smurfs have gone AWOL.

804
00:47:11,412 --> 00:47:12,538
Grace, are you running?

805
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:14,123
No, no, I'm totally fine,
but they need your help!

806
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:16,049
Patrick, I'm afraid they're gonna
get themselves killed!

807
00:47:16,125 --> 00:47:18,253
Sweetie, they're fine.
They can send us a tiny thank-you note

808
00:47:18,336 --> 00:47:20,464
when they get back to shroom town.
Right after they invent paper.

809
00:47:20,588 --> 00:47:21,760
Patrick, they need you.

810
00:47:22,006 --> 00:47:23,474
- Honey...
- Patrick, I need you.

811
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:24,971
Oh, my gosh, please hurry!

812
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:26,511
All right. Where are you?

813
00:47:27,136 --> 00:47:32,017
The man is a lunatic. It's not going to work.
I don't know, he needs Smoops.

814
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:33,191
- "Smurfs."
- Smarps.

815
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:36,146
No, no, "Smurfs." "Smurfs" with an...

816
00:47:36,312 --> 00:47:37,438
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

817
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:38,864
You call that groveling, you fool?

818
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:42,360
Every village has an idiot. What?

819
00:47:43,486 --> 00:47:47,411
You're right. That's him!
Stop! Stop! Smurf thief!

820
00:47:47,615 --> 00:47:49,117
Smurf thief!

821
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:50,793
Come on, guys, the dolls are here!

822
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:54,623
Stargazer, Stargazer, Stargazer.
Stargazer, Stargazer, Stargazer, Stargazer...

823
00:47:56,499 --> 00:47:59,503
So that's where all the unicorns went.

824
00:47:59,627 --> 00:48:02,471
I'm not afraid to go off on my own,
I thought you might like the company.

825
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:04,014
Fine. Then hang on.

826
00:48:06,634 --> 00:48:10,229
A Smurf cannon! The only way to fly.

827
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:12,772
Perfect.

828
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:18,446
Time to catch some air! Smurfabunga!

829
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:21,031
That'll put some air up your skirt!

830
00:48:24,235 --> 00:48:26,078
Gotta be a Stargazer up here somewhere.

831
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:27,495
Predator!

832
00:48:30,533 --> 00:48:31,955
Smurf droppings.

833
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:37,381
These are disgustingly tasty.

834
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:40,835
Hello.

835
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:43,717
Oh, creepy.

836
00:48:43,796 --> 00:48:46,800
I hope they weren't looking
for a stargazer, too.

837
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:48,509
Stargazers, stargazers...

838
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:49,851
Dresses!

839
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:53,352
You mean I can have
more than one kind of dress?

840
00:48:53,431 --> 00:48:54,478
What?

841
00:48:54,557 --> 00:48:56,605
Papa, I'm telling you,
we're never gonna find those...

842
00:48:56,684 --> 00:48:58,778
- Stargazers.
- They're dangerously high.

843
00:48:58,853 --> 00:49:01,322
You're right.
We're gonna need something tall.

844
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:11,366
- Don't you think someone will notice us?
- Just act natural.

845
00:49:11,449 --> 00:49:13,042
- I'm a bear.
- Brainy!

846
00:49:14,869 --> 00:49:16,712
I'm coming. I'm coming, I'm coming, guys.

847
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:18,714
Hold still, stairs!

848
00:49:19,165 --> 00:49:20,667
Look at the stair-climbing toy!

849
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:21,921
- Hey.
- What is that?

850
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:23,134
- Let me see it.
- Careful.

851
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:25,178
- I want one, too, Mommy!
- Let me see.

852
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:27,756
I'm just tired of the whole dating game.

853
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:31,140
Just say who you are
and be who you say, right?

854
00:49:32,011 --> 00:49:33,729
I can't seem to get it to scan.

855
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:36,057
My son wants one of those
blue animatronic things.

856
00:49:36,849 --> 00:49:38,317
Can you help me out here?
Do they come in pink?

857
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:39,860
- My daughter wants pink.
- I'm sorry.

858
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:41,232
What aisle did you find this on?

859
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:42,404
- I'll take the floor model.
- I was here first.

860
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:45,450
- There's a line.
- Can I interest you in a Coldy Holdy Ice Bat?

861
00:49:45,566 --> 00:49:46,783
What? Ice Bat?

862
00:49:47,151 --> 00:49:48,448
It comes in pink.

863
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:54,538
Smurf thief! Stop!

864
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:06,175
Do I use my grouchiness as a wall
because I'm afraid to be vulnerable?

865
00:50:06,337 --> 00:50:07,634
You bet.

866
00:50:07,755 --> 00:50:09,382
Smurf!

867
00:50:09,465 --> 00:50:10,808
But I've got feelings.

868
00:50:10,883 --> 00:50:14,262
No. No, I can't be out already!
What was I thinking?

869
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:17,981
Wasting my only drop of Smurf essence
on that old hag?

870
00:50:25,314 --> 00:50:27,487
It's a big problem, sir.
We don't seem to have it in stock.

871
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:30,945
Hey! Keep your smurfs to yourselves!

872
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:34,619
- Don't you people have any boundaries?
- Grab it!

873
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:36,245
I'm not a toy!

874
00:50:36,325 --> 00:50:37,497
- Where is she?
- Where'd she go?

875
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:38,623
- There she is!
- There she is!

876
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:40,079
Hey, this dress is mine!

877
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:42,790
- Smurfette!
- Wait, I'm shopping.

878
00:50:42,915 --> 00:50:45,338
- Let's shop later.
- Go! Come on!

879
00:50:46,544 --> 00:50:48,262
- Patrick! Patrick, help!
- Clumsy, come here!

880
00:50:48,546 --> 00:50:51,550
A giant's after me! She's huge!

881
00:50:52,091 --> 00:50:53,638
Hey, that's mine!

882
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:55,887
Sorry, little girl, this one's not for...

883
00:50:56,095 --> 00:50:57,893
- Mommy!
- Really?

884
00:50:58,389 --> 00:51:04,021
Don't ever forget that one magical moment
our two worlds met.

885
00:51:04,103 --> 00:51:06,197
And I wasn't grouchy, I wasn't.

886
00:51:08,232 --> 00:51:12,578
Can you just say one thing, please?
I'm dying here.

887
00:51:12,653 --> 00:51:13,996
Hey!

888
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:15,823
That's one!

889
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:19,334
Technically, when loading cargo
onto the head of a bear,

890
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:21,629
- one should distribute the weight...
- Brainy, just pull.

891
00:51:21,704 --> 00:51:24,799
Ahoy, mateys! What are ya waiting for?
We're drawin' a crowd.

892
00:51:25,541 --> 00:51:27,669
- Show-off.
- Oh, dear. They think we're toys.

893
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:30,880
Hold onto your knickers, boys,
it's about to get grisly.

894
00:51:30,963 --> 00:51:34,342
- Don't let me fall!
- Just hang onto that stargazer, you two!

895
00:51:34,425 --> 00:51:35,677
- Hey! Come on, Smurfs!
- They're getting away!

896
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:37,056
Let's go, go, go!

897
00:51:37,136 --> 00:51:39,264
I'll have you at ramming speed in no time.

898
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:41,519
- Hold on!
- I think we lost them.

899
00:51:42,391 --> 00:51:43,859
- Again with the head.
- Oh, dear.

900
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:46,938
- Out of the way or I'll caber toss ya!
- Where did you learn how to drive?

901
00:51:47,021 --> 00:51:49,490
- You think you can do better?
- Yes, I do believe I can do better.

902
00:51:52,151 --> 00:51:53,903
Two more!

903
00:51:54,403 --> 00:51:56,952
- Brainy! Gutsy!
- Papa!

904
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:00,542
Grace, that's Gargamel!

905
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:07,300
- Oh, you again! Get your paws off me!
- No, no, no, no.

906
00:52:08,334 --> 00:52:09,711
Bad kitty!

907
00:52:10,169 --> 00:52:11,466
Oh, I hate that Cat!

908
00:52:18,344 --> 00:52:19,687
Gargamel.

909
00:52:19,887 --> 00:52:21,389
Smurfette.

910
00:52:21,472 --> 00:52:23,850
More lovely than ever.

911
00:52:24,058 --> 00:52:27,403
Oh, Gargamel,
I guess you've outsmarted us again.

912
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:29,988
Or not!

913
00:52:31,732 --> 00:52:35,737
Azrael. Azrael, what are you doing?
Get out of my suckamajig!

914
00:52:36,654 --> 00:52:38,201
- Get out!
- Let me help you with that.

915
00:52:39,073 --> 00:52:42,919
Oh, thank you, kind... You! You...

916
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:49,003
Yahoo!

917
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:52,715
- Patrick.
- Hey.

918
00:52:54,505 --> 00:52:55,927
- Impressive.
- Thanks.

919
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:57,633
- I'll get the Stargazer.
- I'll get the Smurfs.

920
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:08,944
That's him! He took it right off my back!
Leaf-blower thief!

921
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:10,771
Please stand up, sir.
You're going downtown.

922
00:53:10,979 --> 00:53:14,233
- Do not resist. Do not resist!
- Unhand me. Unhand me, you heathens!

923
00:53:14,358 --> 00:53:18,454
Or suffer the wrath
of the great and powerful...

924
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:27,041
Let me... Let me see here...

925
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:52,029
How can you be the only girl in the village?

926
00:53:52,104 --> 00:53:55,734
Well, see, I wasn't brought
by a stork like the others.

927
00:53:56,900 --> 00:54:00,530
I was created by Gargamel
to trap the other Smurfs.

928
00:54:00,779 --> 00:54:03,623
Wow. And then what happened?

929
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:05,204
Papa saved me.

930
00:54:05,284 --> 00:54:10,211
He cast a special spell and then helped me
become the Smurf I was meant to be.

931
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:12,541
No. Play it safe.

932
00:54:17,004 --> 00:54:23,558
"Odile, pending your approval,
it's ready to go to the billboard agency."

933
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:29,308
Well, here goes nothing.

934
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:34,571
- Papa should be done by now.
- Yeah. Enough with the suspense.

935
00:54:34,646 --> 00:54:36,694
- I wanna go home.
- Me, too.

936
00:54:36,815 --> 00:54:40,615
Now that that wily wizard's got our scent,
it's a whole new wager.

937
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:43,573
Without that blue moon,
our giblets are gravy.

938
00:54:46,492 --> 00:54:47,960
Well, it's off.

939
00:54:48,035 --> 00:54:51,380
Time to either celebrate
or file for unemployment.

940
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:54,541
Hey, what's wrong?

941
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:56,426
- I'm sure we'll be fine.
- Oh. it's okay.

942
00:54:56,502 --> 00:54:59,051
- That one's hypersmurfilating.
- Yeah, tell me about it.

943
00:54:59,171 --> 00:55:01,094
- It's all this waitin' that's killin' us.
- Yeah.

944
00:55:01,882 --> 00:55:03,805
I know the feeling.

945
00:55:05,344 --> 00:55:07,096
Better yet...

946
00:55:07,346 --> 00:55:09,064
I know the cure.

947
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:14,353
You just match the colors with the buttons.

948
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:24,408
You try.

949
00:55:24,488 --> 00:55:26,832
Hey! Go, Grouchy!

950
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:28,830
- You're good!
- Nice one!

951
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:32,709
Hey, look at me, guys! I'm shredding!

952
00:55:32,788 --> 00:55:33,960
Walk this way...

953
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:35,165
You sing.

954
00:55:35,249 --> 00:55:38,298
Talk this way
Just give me a kiss

955
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:41,805
It's a rock face.

956
00:55:42,506 --> 00:55:44,224
- It's Gene Simmons. He's a...
- Huh?

957
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:45,346
Never mind.

958
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:46,768
- Like this
- Like this

959
00:55:50,556 --> 00:55:52,809
Smurfette sweetie is a classy kind of sassy

960
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:54,734
Little skirts climbing way up her knee

961
00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:56,983
Not another single girl
in the whole smurf in' world

962
00:55:57,062 --> 00:55:59,156
And I can't believe
she's lookin' at me

963
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:00,323
- it's a complete
- Surrender

964
00:56:00,399 --> 00:56:01,616
- To the power of her
- Gender

965
00:56:01,692 --> 00:56:03,569
So I close my eyes and make a wish

966
00:56:03,652 --> 00:56:04,744
- I just want to
- Savor

967
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:05,912
- All her smurf berry
- Flavor

968
00:56:05,988 --> 00:56:08,286
So I smurf ed her just a little kiss
Like this

969
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:16,290
- Check out Clumsy.
- Whoa, Clumsy.

970
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:18,250
- You found your niche.
- Yeah!

971
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:20,677
Clumsy, holdin' it down. Look at him go!

972
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:22,721
- Come on, Gutsy!
- Here we go!

973
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:25,675
Yay, Gutsy! Get down with your bad smurf!

974
00:56:25,757 --> 00:56:27,225
- Go, Gutsy!
- That's right.

975
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:31,225
- Careful.
- Get your smurf on!

976
00:56:31,305 --> 00:56:32,807
- Gutsy!
- Nice!

977
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:34,563
- Yeah!
- Thank you.

978
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:36,313
That was rare.

979
00:56:56,038 --> 00:56:59,133
Hey, guys. How do you like my new dress?

980
00:57:00,292 --> 00:57:02,420
Whoa! Is there a draught in here?

981
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:05,847
Oh, okay, that's not what I had in mind.

982
00:57:07,716 --> 00:57:09,263
Are you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?

983
00:57:09,468 --> 00:57:10,936
Sorry, boys.

984
00:57:12,304 --> 00:57:14,602
Yeah, that cools the giblets.

985
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:18,231
Nothin' like a cool breeze
through my Enchanted Forest.

986
00:57:24,608 --> 00:57:26,076
- It's approved.
- What?

987
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:28,153
- She approved it. She approved the ad!
- She loved it?

988
00:57:28,236 --> 00:57:32,082
Well, she said "approved,"
so coming from her, that's love.

989
00:57:32,324 --> 00:57:33,701
Oh, my goodness!

990
00:57:33,784 --> 00:57:35,252
- Patrick, yeah!
- You owned it!

991
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:37,750
Oh, my goodness! Yay, Patrick!

992
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:39,923
Yeah.

993
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:42,713
No jumping, no jumping, no jumping.
No jumping, no jumping. Okay.

994
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,463
- Should I send it? I'm not going to.
- Yes! Do it!

995
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:46,717
- Do it this minute.
- I will do it. All right.

996
00:57:46,797 --> 00:57:48,515
Do it, do it.

997
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:49,716
Go, go, go!

998
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:52,428
Tomorrow this'll be on every billboard
in New York City.

999
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:54,020
It's a go, laddie boy!

1000
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:57,558
- Well done, Master Winslow.
- Oh! Hey, guys, Papa's back.

1001
00:57:57,641 --> 00:57:59,314
- Papa, are your calculations done?
- Yeah!

1002
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:01,103
I'm nearly out of smurf berries.

1003
00:58:01,186 --> 00:58:04,531
It's proving more difficult than I'd hoped.

1004
00:58:04,773 --> 00:58:06,571
But we are going home, right?

1005
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:09,699
Of course. Just not tonight.

1006
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:12,372
Now, off to bed.

1007
00:58:16,702 --> 00:58:20,206
I was hoping I'd be sleeping
in my mushroom tonight.

1008
00:58:20,414 --> 00:58:22,212
I miss the other Smurfs.

1009
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:24,338
Me, too.

1010
00:58:24,418 --> 00:58:26,921
I've never spent the night away
from home before.

1011
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:31,516
Well, there was last night.
But who could sleep?

1012
00:58:33,427 --> 00:58:35,600
Hush. Hush now, Smurfs.

1013
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:39,604
Everything's going to be just fine.

1014
00:58:39,975 --> 00:58:41,227
Papa?

1015
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:45,780
Do you really believe we're ever gonna
get home to the other Smurfs?

1016
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:47,736
Don't worry.

1017
00:58:47,816 --> 00:58:50,695
We'll be reunited with the others
soon enough.

1018
00:58:55,282 --> 00:58:58,456
If only the stars would align.

1019
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:10,840
You know who I miss?
Chef Smurf. Hefty Smurf.

1020
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:14,059
- Hey, Jokey Smurf.
- G reedy. Narrator.

1021
00:59:14,468 --> 00:59:17,142
- Painter. Baker.
- Harmony.

1022
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:21,691
Oh, I miss Complimentary Smurf.
He always has such nice things to say.

1023
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:24,937
I'll tell you who I don't miss,
Passive-Aggressive Smurf.

1024
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:26,192
- Aye.
- Yeah.

1025
00:59:26,313 --> 00:59:29,817
He's always so nice,
but when he leaves you feel bad.

1026
00:59:30,859 --> 00:59:34,204
Ah, another wretched Smurf less night.

1027
00:59:34,863 --> 00:59:37,491
Oh, hello, little moth.

1028
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:43,422
Perhaps with your help
I'll find a way to get them back.

1029
00:59:44,164 --> 00:59:47,714
Oh, you and I are kindred spirits, little one.

1030
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:50,299
Both of us meant to soar.

1031
00:59:50,378 --> 00:59:55,384
Go now, and bring back an army
of mighty eagles to free me.

1032
00:59:55,926 --> 00:59:59,521
Fly, tiny eagle.
Fly and bring back your brethren.

1033
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:01,852
Fly! Fly!

1034
01:00:02,182 --> 01:00:03,559
Fly!

1035
01:00:08,188 --> 01:00:11,362
Okay. Let's see here.

1036
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:12,567
Hey.

1037
01:00:13,193 --> 01:00:14,945
I'm guessing you have
a long night ahead of you.

1038
01:00:16,196 --> 01:00:19,450
- You guys drink coffee?
- Is a Smurf's butt blue?

1039
01:00:21,576 --> 01:00:27,299
So tell me, that weird guy
in the ratty bathrobe at the toy store?

1040
01:00:27,374 --> 01:00:30,127
- Gargamel?
- He's not really a wizard, is he?

1041
01:00:30,252 --> 01:00:34,302
Not the smartest of sorcerers,
but dangerous just the same.

1042
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:36,220
Thank you.

1043
01:00:37,425 --> 01:00:41,100
Back home, I could hold him at bay
with a spell or two.

1044
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:43,898
But here, without my books and potions...

1045
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:48,730
Well, today we got lucky.
But next time, who knows?

1046
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:50,234
Well, what are you gonna do?

1047
01:00:50,438 --> 01:00:54,568
I'll do anything and everything I can do
to get my Smurfs home.

1048
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:58,618
I won't ever give up. They're my family.

1049
01:00:59,114 --> 01:01:01,583
And you never give up on family.

1050
01:01:05,245 --> 01:01:08,249
Doesn't it freak you out sometimes

1051
01:01:08,999 --> 01:01:12,173
having all those little guys
depending on you?

1052
01:01:13,587 --> 01:01:15,931
I mean, what if you screw up?

1053
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:18,846
How'd you know when you were ready?

1054
01:01:19,259 --> 01:01:21,512
Here. Come sit on Papa's lap.

1055
01:01:23,763 --> 01:01:25,891
Yeah, right. Scratch that.

1056
01:01:25,974 --> 01:01:28,648
- Probably not the best idea.
- Yeah, yeah.

1057
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:30,190
Let me ask you something.

1058
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:33,941
Why did you come for us today
when your Grace called?

1059
01:01:34,441 --> 01:01:37,445
She needed me. I could hear it in her voice.

1060
01:01:39,613 --> 01:01:41,911
Well, that's what being a papa is.

1061
01:01:41,990 --> 01:01:44,459
When it comes time, you just do.

1062
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:49,206
And knowing what to do
doesn't come from up here.

1063
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:56,339
It comes from here, where it matters most.

1064
01:01:57,547 --> 01:01:59,140
My spleen?

1065
01:01:59,216 --> 01:02:01,514
No, your heart.

1066
01:02:01,635 --> 01:02:05,981
I'm trying to have a moment here,
you whippersnapper.

1067
01:02:10,018 --> 01:02:13,818
- You're a good papa, Papa.
- And you'll be a good one, too.

1068
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:33,963
Come on, what you doing, man?
Get that weight off there.

1069
01:02:34,042 --> 01:02:36,340
Come on, baby, stop playing.

1070
01:02:37,712 --> 01:02:40,841
Come on, you silly moth.
Where are my eagles?

1071
01:02:41,841 --> 01:02:44,014
You know what happens to people
who sit on my bench?

1072
01:02:44,678 --> 01:02:46,021
Be gone with you, behemoth,

1073
01:02:46,554 --> 01:02:50,900
for I have instructed a moth
to summon forth a gaggle of noble eagles

1074
01:02:51,017 --> 01:02:52,735
to free me from this confine.

1075
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,022
- Get up, Grandpa!
- Hey.

1076
01:02:56,064 --> 01:02:57,987
You see? You see?

1077
01:02:58,066 --> 01:03:01,536
The dungeon isn't built that can hold
the likes of Gargamel.

1078
01:03:01,695 --> 01:03:07,043
Behold my glorious army of... Flies?

1079
01:03:07,117 --> 01:03:09,791
- Flies? I Said "to fly." "Fly."
- What is this?

1080
01:03:09,869 --> 01:03:13,544
Not "flies," you light-loving moron.

1081
01:03:14,541 --> 01:03:16,714
All right, up, up, up, bother it all.

1082
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:20,301
Up! Up, you inglorious devils!

1083
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:22,599
So long, scallywags!

1084
01:03:25,302 --> 01:03:28,852
Well, don't do it again.
Go around it, go around!

1085
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:32,275
- Oh, that's nasty.
- Go around it. Stupid flies.

1086
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:33,727
Wait, take me with you!

1087
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:35,904
Wait! Wait!

1088
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:42,410
To my castle for more essence!

1089
01:03:53,496 --> 01:03:54,998
Here they come, here they come.

1090
01:03:58,460 --> 01:04:01,259
- Pretty smurf y, if I do say so myself.
- Yeah.

1091
01:04:01,338 --> 01:04:04,342
Come on, Elway, right over here.
Good boy. Thank you very much.

1092
01:04:04,424 --> 01:04:06,301
- Oh, my goodness.
- Here we go.

1093
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:09,437
- There we are.
- Clumsy.

1094
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:13,016
- Blue thumbs.
- This is unbelievable.

1095
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:14,521
I think there's too much pink.

1096
01:04:14,601 --> 01:04:18,026
Just because your name is Grouchy
doesn't mean you always have to be grouchy.

1097
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:19,447
Yeah, it does.

1098
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:20,899
- Smurfette.
- Hi.

1099
01:04:20,982 --> 01:04:24,407
- High five. High four.
- High four.

1100
01:04:24,486 --> 01:04:30,038
Great news! The stars have revealed
a perfect time to smurf the blue moon.

1101
01:04:31,659 --> 01:04:33,912
- We're going home! Yay!
- I knew you'd do it, Papa!

1102
01:04:33,995 --> 01:04:35,747
- All right!
- Smurftastic!

1103
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:37,423
I never doubted it for a second.

1104
01:04:37,499 --> 01:04:41,549
It has to be done tonight,
between first star and high moon.

1105
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:43,588
That's our only chance.

1106
01:04:43,671 --> 01:04:46,675
But we'll need a magic spell
that works in this realm

1107
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,768
to open the portal home.

1108
01:04:48,843 --> 01:04:52,017
- Master Winslow, a question, please.
- Yeah, shoot.

1109
01:04:52,138 --> 01:04:54,391
Is there a place that sells spells?

1110
01:04:54,474 --> 01:04:55,726
No.

1111
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:59,320
- Is there a place that proffers potions?
- Yeah, no.

1112
01:04:59,687 --> 01:05:01,655
How about old books?

1113
01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:04,450
Wait, there's an antique book shop
right near where I work.

1114
01:05:04,526 --> 01:05:06,403
- Yes. Dr. Wong's. Yeah.
- Dr. Wong's something.

1115
01:05:06,486 --> 01:05:10,161
- Perfect. That'll do.
- Oh, hear that, boys? We're almost home.

1116
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:12,163
- Yeah!
- I love being almost home.

1117
01:05:12,242 --> 01:05:14,244
Hey! Smurf hug!

1118
01:05:15,829 --> 01:05:17,672
Oh, I love you guys!

1119
01:05:17,831 --> 01:05:19,299
Bring it in, big fella.

1120
01:05:19,374 --> 01:05:20,967
- I wouldn't...
- Come on, we know you want to.

1121
01:05:21,042 --> 01:05:22,214
- Yes.
- Yeah, come on, Patrick.

1122
01:05:22,335 --> 01:05:23,712
- If I can do it, you can do it.
- Go on, big fella.

1123
01:05:23,837 --> 01:05:25,305
- Here he comes!
- Smurf hug!

1124
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:27,508
- We're goin' home!
- Hey there.

1125
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:35,932
Hey, get up here.

1126
01:05:41,229 --> 01:05:43,823
- That's it, laddie. Nice one.
- What's that?

1127
01:05:43,898 --> 01:05:46,071
Yeah. All of ya. All of ya!

1128
01:05:46,401 --> 01:05:49,245
Oh, look!
We don't have to make a blue moon.

1129
01:05:49,362 --> 01:05:51,035
We've already got one.

1130
01:05:51,281 --> 01:05:52,658
- Really?
- What?

1131
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:55,744
- Look, guys, right over there.
- No, it isn't.

1132
01:05:55,869 --> 01:05:58,463
It is. Smurfette's right.
Look at the blue moon.

1133
01:06:00,915 --> 01:06:03,213
That's the wrong ad.

1134
01:06:13,761 --> 01:06:14,933
What happened to my office?

1135
01:06:15,138 --> 01:06:18,267
We fixed it for the baby. Another smurf hug!

1136
01:06:18,391 --> 01:06:22,066
No. No, no, no. This isn't happening.
This isn't happening.

1137
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:25,982
Someone sent this
to the ad agency last night.

1138
01:06:26,065 --> 01:06:27,692
- Who messed with my computer?
- I dunno.

1139
01:06:27,775 --> 01:06:30,574
- None of my Smurfs would...
- Wasn't me.

1140
01:06:33,948 --> 01:06:38,829
I Gargamel!, sorta, tripped.

1141
01:06:38,912 --> 01:06:41,415
Yeah, well, you Gargamel!, sorta,
just got me fired.

1142
01:06:41,748 --> 01:06:43,500
You sent the wrong file.

1143
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:46,132
- Patrick, it was just an accident.
- What am I supposed to do, Grace?

1144
01:06:46,252 --> 01:06:48,755
You said that they would bring good luck.
This is anything but good.

1145
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:51,307
I never should've let this happen.
I should've said no.

1146
01:06:51,424 --> 01:06:55,349
I never wanted a house
full of little people running around!

1147
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:00,938
Blue. Little blue...

1148
01:07:01,142 --> 01:07:02,314
Okay...

1149
01:07:03,478 --> 01:07:04,604
Patrick.

1150
01:07:06,814 --> 01:07:07,986
What are you doing?

1151
01:07:08,107 --> 01:07:09,825
Going to try to save my job.

1152
01:07:09,943 --> 01:07:12,787
We never intended to be a burden,
Master Winslow.

1153
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:14,739
I'm smurfilly sorry about what I...

1154
01:07:14,822 --> 01:07:18,872
Stop saying "smurf" for everything.
What does that even mean? Smurf!

1155
01:07:19,285 --> 01:07:20,628
Smurfitty-smurf-smurf-smurf!

1156
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:24,128
There's no call
for that kind of language, laddie.

1157
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:25,291
See?

1158
01:07:25,833 --> 01:07:27,210
Okay, Patrick, wait.

1159
01:07:28,545 --> 01:07:30,297
- Hey, hey!
- Will you...

1160
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:32,132
- Wait, Patrick.
- Maybe I can try to fix it.

1161
01:07:32,215 --> 01:07:33,558
Just stop and listen to me
for a second, please.

1162
01:07:33,633 --> 01:07:36,557
- What?
- Look, I'm really sorry about your job, okay?

1163
01:07:36,636 --> 01:07:38,684
And I hope that you can straighten that out.

1164
01:07:38,805 --> 01:07:41,183
But you are so not seeing
the big picture here.

1165
01:07:41,975 --> 01:07:45,479
I mean, look around.
Look what's happening right now.

1166
01:07:45,687 --> 01:07:46,859
Of all the people on the planet,

1167
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:49,358
those magical little creatures came to us.

1168
01:07:49,482 --> 01:07:51,155
They chose us.

1169
01:07:51,859 --> 01:07:55,409
Don't you see
how absolutely amazing that is?

1170
01:07:55,697 --> 01:07:57,950
This is a once-in-a-lifetime thing, Patrick.

1171
01:07:58,032 --> 01:08:00,034
This is our blue moon.

1172
01:08:01,578 --> 01:08:04,832
And if you don't stop
for just a second to see that,

1173
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:06,503
you're gonna miss it.

1174
01:08:14,841 --> 01:08:16,514
Hey, hey. Taxi!

1175
01:08:17,427 --> 01:08:20,431
Come on! Come on! Blast. Blast you!

1176
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:23,854
There's got to be some essence
in here somewhere!

1177
01:08:24,517 --> 01:08:25,860
NOT DOW.

1178
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:27,570
What? What?

1179
01:08:32,734 --> 01:08:36,409
Very, very well done, my little friend.

1180
01:08:37,572 --> 01:08:40,542
And to think, I almost ate you that time.

1181
01:08:42,035 --> 01:08:46,632
Come, Azrael. We must find this Patrick,
the rouge merchant.

1182
01:08:46,873 --> 01:08:50,218
He will lead us to our
elusive little blue quarry.

1183
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:54,260
Don't you just have a switch or something
to shut them off?

1184
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:56,178
Tomorrow? Are you kidding me?

1185
01:08:56,257 --> 01:08:59,887
Ron, Ron. If I don't get those ads down now,
I don't have a job tomorrow.

1186
01:09:32,919 --> 01:09:34,466
Smurf me.

1187
01:10:22,885 --> 01:10:24,558
Which way to the bookstore, Brainy?

1188
01:10:24,637 --> 01:10:25,729
According to the searching device,

1189
01:10:25,805 --> 01:10:28,024
we take the F machine
two dots past the red circle to Chinaland.

1190
01:10:28,141 --> 01:10:30,394
- Look out, Brainy.
- "Chinatown," birdbrain.

1191
01:10:30,476 --> 01:10:31,693
- Smurftito, smurftato.
- Here it is.

1192
01:10:31,811 --> 01:10:32,858
- Come on, everybody.
- Let's go, let's go.

1193
01:10:32,979 --> 01:10:34,731
- Mind the gap.
- Wait? Are we sure about this?

1194
01:10:34,814 --> 01:10:36,066
- What?
- Jump!

1195
01:10:36,149 --> 01:10:37,992
- Oh, my.
- Not happy.

1196
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:42,371
Come on, Brainy_
Let's poke around this great steel carriage.

1197
01:10:42,488 --> 01:10:44,707
- Is it safe?
- Of course it is.

1198
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:49,670
That was great.

1199
01:10:50,705 --> 01:10:53,424
I hope we find this place soon.
I can't see out of this...

1200
01:10:55,376 --> 01:10:56,593
For smurf's sake.

1201
01:10:56,669 --> 01:10:58,888
I thought that's why we left Clumsy behind.

1202
01:10:59,005 --> 01:11:00,257
Oh, it smells like butter in here.

1203
01:11:00,339 --> 01:11:02,262
Where do you suppose
this magic bookstore could be?

1204
01:11:02,341 --> 01:11:04,014
- Wait a minute.
- There it is.

1205
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:05,512
- It's closed.
- Figures.

1206
01:11:05,762 --> 01:11:08,060
We have to find a way in. Come on.

1207
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:16,439
I'm gettin' too old for this.

1208
01:11:17,523 --> 01:11:18,775
- Brainy.
- Gutsy.

1209
01:11:18,858 --> 01:11:20,075
All right, everybody.

1210
01:11:20,193 --> 01:11:21,285
- Hey.
- Wow.

1211
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:22,452
This place looks creepy to me.

1212
01:11:22,528 --> 01:11:24,371
It's not creepy, it's different. And I like it.

1213
01:11:24,447 --> 01:11:26,745
Let's just get the book
and get outta here.

1214
01:11:26,866 --> 01:11:30,291
You're right. This book of spells
is our ticket home.

1215
01:11:32,205 --> 01:11:37,462
I am but a simple wizard with a simple desire,
limitless power and world adulation.

1216
01:11:37,627 --> 01:11:40,722
Now why does it have to be so hard?

1217
01:11:46,469 --> 01:11:50,064
Pardon me. Please, wise sir.
Wise sir. Please, please.

1218
01:11:50,223 --> 01:11:52,726
Wherever did you hear
that ear-damning squall?

1219
01:11:52,892 --> 01:11:54,018
It's your little blue men.

1220
01:11:54,101 --> 01:11:56,399
I saw them going into the bookstore
around the corner.

1221
01:11:58,940 --> 01:12:01,284
You know, that song is really annoying.

1222
01:12:02,109 --> 01:12:04,578
Cautiously excited.

1223
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:09,079
That's not it. That's not it.
Hey! Oh, no, that's not it.

1224
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:11,832
Look at all these amazing books.
It's gotta be in here somewhere.

1225
01:12:11,953 --> 01:12:14,422
No, this isn't it.
You see anything, Smurfette?

1226
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:17,959
Nothin' up here, guys. Look out below!

1227
01:12:18,417 --> 01:12:21,762
- I've got somethin', lads.
- Great job, Gutsy.

1228
01:12:21,838 --> 01:12:23,761
Oh. Nearly there.

1229
01:12:24,924 --> 01:12:29,600
- Well done.
- Just a minute. That's it. There we go.

1230
01:12:29,762 --> 01:12:31,014
Ah, yes.

1231
01:12:31,097 --> 01:12:33,441
"L'Histoire des Schtroumpfs. ”

1232
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:35,772
Peyo.

1233
01:12:38,271 --> 01:12:40,444
- That's us.
- Yes, this is the one.

1234
01:12:42,108 --> 01:12:44,281
- Look at that.
- Wow.

1235
01:12:44,443 --> 01:12:46,116
Well, I'll be smurf ed.

1236
01:12:46,612 --> 01:12:49,206
The secret runes are hidden in the drawing.

1237
01:12:49,282 --> 01:12:50,875
You see all that in there?

1238
01:12:50,992 --> 01:12:53,666
Look here, at the patterns on this page.

1239
01:12:59,542 --> 01:13:01,544
Openous-lockicuss.

1240
01:13:08,634 --> 01:13:10,011
What?

1241
01:13:15,683 --> 01:13:20,359
You're right, Azrael.
This does have "me" written all over it.

1242
01:13:28,154 --> 01:13:31,158
Oh, that's just plain naughty.

1243
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:36,667
All that remains now is to return
to the waterfall and invoke this spell, tonight.

1244
01:13:36,746 --> 01:13:39,374
- And we can go home?
- And we can go home.

1245
01:13:39,498 --> 01:13:41,592
- Oh, you're going home, all right.
- No.

1246
01:13:41,709 --> 01:13:45,680
To a little place I like to call
BellVeedaRay Castle,

1247
01:13:46,005 --> 01:13:49,760
where your essence shall finally be mine.

1248
01:13:50,384 --> 01:13:52,182
- The dragon wand.
- No!

1249
01:13:52,261 --> 01:13:53,387
It's...

1250
01:13:53,512 --> 01:13:55,264
Oh, please, please, allow me.

1251
01:13:56,766 --> 01:13:59,110
- It's Gargamel!
- Run, Smurfs!

1252
01:13:59,685 --> 01:14:01,062
- Come on, Smurfs!
- Go, go, go!

1253
01:14:01,187 --> 01:14:02,279
Wait for me!

1254
01:14:02,355 --> 01:14:04,449
- To the door!
- Smurfentine! Smurfentine!

1255
01:14:04,523 --> 01:14:06,491
- Hurry!
- Yes, yes, do resist, little Smurfs.

1256
01:14:06,567 --> 01:14:07,739
After all,

1257
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:10,704
what is the hunt without the thrill!

1258
01:14:14,909 --> 01:14:16,081
No!

1259
01:14:24,877 --> 01:14:26,220
- We gotta go! Move!
- Run!

1260
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:27,922
- Get goin', Smurfs!
- Faster, faster.

1261
01:14:28,047 --> 01:14:29,094
Let's get outta here.

1262
01:14:29,215 --> 01:14:32,936
Brainy, take the spell, brew the potion
and smurf the moon tonight.

1263
01:14:33,344 --> 01:14:34,516
It has to be tonight.

1264
01:14:34,595 --> 01:14:36,142
Me? Smurf the moon?

1265
01:14:36,222 --> 01:14:38,395
- No, no, I'm not ready.
- You have to be.

1266
01:14:39,684 --> 01:14:42,153
- Go. And no matter what happens...
- Papa?

1267
01:14:42,228 --> 01:14:43,821
- ...Do not come back for me.
- What?

1268
01:14:43,896 --> 01:14:45,193
- Papa, no!
- No!

1269
01:14:45,272 --> 01:14:47,570
- Papa!
- What are you waiting for, Gargamel?

1270
01:14:47,692 --> 01:14:50,070
Come to papa, Papa!

1271
01:14:51,278 --> 01:14:53,576
- Just go!
- Papa!

1272
01:14:53,698 --> 01:14:55,041
- Papa!
- No!

1273
01:14:55,116 --> 01:14:56,584
Keep movin', lass.

1274
01:14:56,742 --> 01:14:59,461
- Do as Papa said.
- Papa!

1275
01:15:00,037 --> 01:15:03,211
Is that all that you've got, Gargamel?

1276
01:15:15,386 --> 01:15:17,059
What's gonna happen to Papa?

1277
01:15:17,138 --> 01:15:21,143
Papa told us to smurf the moon,
and that's exactly what we're gonna do.

1278
01:15:21,559 --> 01:15:23,232
Come on. We don't have much time.

1279
01:15:23,436 --> 01:15:24,733
"Come on"? Come on, where?

1280
01:15:24,812 --> 01:15:27,110
How are we gonna get back to Clumsy?

1281
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:31,778
We ride. Come on!

1282
01:15:32,820 --> 01:15:35,448
- Be still, bird.
- I don't think they're friendly.

1283
01:15:35,573 --> 01:15:37,621
- Well, neither am I.
- But they carry disease.

1284
01:15:38,409 --> 01:15:40,832
And Smurfs. Let's ride.

1285
01:15:40,953 --> 01:15:42,626
- Whoa, bird, whoa!
- Come on!

1286
01:15:42,747 --> 01:15:44,749
But I'm not sure I can do this.

1287
01:15:45,958 --> 01:15:48,336
You can do it, Brainy. Hold on!

1288
01:15:48,961 --> 01:15:52,261
According to my calculations,
this is dangerous!

1289
01:15:54,633 --> 01:15:56,260
It's getting dark.

1290
01:15:56,343 --> 01:15:59,267
Yeah. Yeah, I think
we'd better go look for them.

1291
01:15:59,346 --> 01:16:00,643
Yeah.

1292
01:16:04,185 --> 01:16:05,653
Hi.

1293
01:16:09,857 --> 01:16:13,828
- Where are the others?
- We think they're still at the bookstore.

1294
01:16:14,487 --> 01:16:17,161
Listen, Grace, I'm...

1295
01:16:22,495 --> 01:16:23,667
Hey, Odile.

1296
01:16:23,829 --> 01:16:26,173
Patrick...

1297
01:16:28,167 --> 01:16:30,465
Listen, listen. Before you fire me,

1298
01:16:30,544 --> 01:16:34,014
I know that the ads that ran
weren't the ads I sent.

1299
01:16:35,341 --> 01:16:38,561
But they're the ads I should have sent.

1300
01:16:39,386 --> 01:16:41,559
The ads I almost did send.

1301
01:16:41,972 --> 01:16:44,350
But I didn't 'cause...

1302
01:16:45,893 --> 01:16:47,315
I second-guessed myself.

1303
01:16:48,062 --> 01:16:53,489
I gave you what I thought you wanted,
instead of what I thought was right.

1304
01:16:55,736 --> 01:16:58,159
But this is right.

1305
01:16:58,531 --> 01:17:01,284
It means something to me and...
I don't know,

1306
01:17:01,367 --> 01:17:03,586
I think it's gonna mean
something to others, too.

1307
01:17:05,371 --> 01:17:10,593
It's not just a moon, Odile, it's a blue moon.

1308
01:17:11,418 --> 01:17:13,591
"Once in a blue moon."

1309
01:17:14,588 --> 01:17:19,219
That means that there are
only a few moments in your life

1310
01:17:19,385 --> 01:17:26,234
when something truly memorable,
truly magical, happens to you.

1311
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:33,283
And, if you hesitate, if you're afraid,

1312
01:17:34,733 --> 01:17:36,360
you might just miss it.

1313
01:17:37,778 --> 01:17:40,076
That's what that image means.

1314
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:45,245
Don't let those blue moon moments
pass you by.

1315
01:17:48,455 --> 01:17:51,755
I will call you back to tell you if you're fired.

1316
01:17:57,590 --> 01:17:59,763
I so smurf in' love you.

1317
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:05,348
Left-left, right! Right-right, bird!

1318
01:18:05,431 --> 01:18:07,934
- Brace for impact!
- The window's open, ya ninny.

1319
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:11,233
We're outta control!

1320
01:18:11,604 --> 01:18:13,948
Whoa, bird! Watch out for the...

1321
01:18:14,899 --> 01:18:16,742
- That'll do, pigeon.
- Thank you, bird.

1322
01:18:16,817 --> 01:18:18,660
Look! We got the incantation.

1323
01:18:18,777 --> 01:18:20,825
- Where's Papa?
- Gargamel's got him.

1324
01:18:20,946 --> 01:18:22,994
- What?
- Oh, no.

1325
01:18:23,157 --> 01:18:26,661
He took him to some place
called BellVeedaRay Castle.

1326
01:18:26,785 --> 01:18:29,629
- He's gonna...
- Don't say it.

1327
01:18:29,997 --> 01:18:31,965
BellVeedaRay. What is BellVeedaRay?

1328
01:18:32,082 --> 01:18:35,052
Belve... He's taken him
to Belvedere Castle in Central Park.

1329
01:18:35,127 --> 01:18:37,004
To extract his essence.

1330
01:18:37,129 --> 01:18:39,052
- What? Well, we have to go get him.
- Yeah.

1331
01:18:39,131 --> 01:18:41,350
No! Gargamel's more powerful than ever.

1332
01:18:41,467 --> 01:18:44,471
Papa said no matter what happens
we're not to go back for him.

1333
01:18:44,637 --> 01:18:46,014
He's trying to protect us.

1334
01:18:46,138 --> 01:18:49,642
- No! We can't leave Papa behind.
- It was a Smurf promise.

1335
01:18:49,767 --> 01:18:51,110
No, no, no. We can't.

1336
01:18:51,185 --> 01:18:54,155
We promised Papa
we'd do exactly what he said.

1337
01:18:54,271 --> 01:18:56,114
- That's right.
- I didn't.

1338
01:18:57,983 --> 01:18:59,826
I never promised him anything.

1339
01:19:00,110 --> 01:19:03,990
Neither did I. And there is no way
I'm leaving here without Papa.

1340
01:19:06,033 --> 01:19:08,627
Patrick, wait. I'm coming with you.

1341
01:19:12,122 --> 01:19:13,499
I'm in.

1342
01:19:17,169 --> 01:19:19,012
Aye. Me, too.

1343
01:19:21,173 --> 01:19:25,303
No Smurf left behind! Not Papa, and not you.

1344
01:19:26,178 --> 01:19:29,182
- All for one and one for Smurf!
- All for one and one for Smurf!

1345
01:19:34,561 --> 01:19:37,485
I 'll squeeze a few
And tweeze a few

1346
01:19:37,564 --> 01:19:40,033
And steal their essence blue

1347
01:19:43,237 --> 01:19:47,037
Very impressive, my dear, sweet little Papa!

1348
01:19:50,869 --> 01:19:52,667
Oh, look at this.

1349
01:19:53,205 --> 01:20:00,259
Just a tiny little bit of your little tiny beard
yields me all of this essence.

1350
01:20:01,088 --> 01:20:06,936
Just imagine what I'll be able to harvest
from your entire family of Smurfs.

1351
01:20:07,428 --> 01:20:09,180
Alakazookas!

1352
01:20:12,182 --> 01:20:16,403
Behold my glorious Smurf magic machine!

1353
01:20:20,232 --> 01:20:24,078
No. No! The cages! No! No!

1354
01:20:25,112 --> 01:20:28,742
I'll steam the essence from their sweat.
I'll tug it from their tears!

1355
01:20:28,949 --> 01:20:31,043
I'll snip it from their hair.

1356
01:20:32,244 --> 01:20:34,372
You're a fool, Gargamel.

1357
01:20:34,455 --> 01:20:37,459
My Smurfs are well on their way home
by now.

1358
01:21:02,775 --> 01:21:05,403
Oh, yeah. Let's light this candle.

1359
01:21:11,617 --> 01:21:13,335
Good luck, Gutsy!

1360
01:21:14,078 --> 01:21:17,628
- Into the breach!
- I'll see you there!

1361
01:21:28,133 --> 01:21:31,979
- We all remember the plan, right?
- Let's get our smurf on.

1362
01:21:32,471 --> 01:21:33,688
Brainy, what's happening?

1363
01:21:33,972 --> 01:21:37,818
I've added the ingredients.
It's more powerful than anticipated.

1364
01:21:37,935 --> 01:21:39,357
I don't think I can do it.

1365
01:21:39,478 --> 01:21:43,153
Okay, Brainy, you can do this.
Just say the incantation.

1366
01:22:00,124 --> 01:22:01,501
I'll be smurf ed!

1367
01:22:02,793 --> 01:22:06,639
I did it. I did it, Papa! I did it!

1368
01:22:10,134 --> 01:22:12,637
- I don't believe it!
- Wow.

1369
01:22:13,011 --> 01:22:15,685
- It's the Anjelou moon.
- How did she do that?

1370
01:22:16,306 --> 01:22:18,479
- It's beautiful.
- Oh, Odile.

1371
01:22:18,976 --> 01:22:21,570
- Oh, wow.
- That's wonderful.

1372
01:22:29,862 --> 01:22:32,160
Now, I don't want you to worry, Papa.

1373
01:22:32,239 --> 01:22:35,743
That which doesn't kill you
only makes me stronger.

1374
01:22:37,744 --> 01:22:39,337
- Yo!
- Huh?

1375
01:22:39,580 --> 01:22:42,049
Gargamel! Come out and play!

1376
01:22:42,207 --> 01:22:45,882
Oh, I think our tiny little guests
have finally arrived.

1377
01:22:46,211 --> 01:22:47,463
- No!
- Ah, well.

1378
01:22:47,546 --> 01:22:50,049
Enjoy the ride, Papa!

1379
01:22:51,717 --> 01:22:53,685
And remember, keep your hands and feet

1380
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:56,809
- inside the cart at all times.
- No. No! No!

1381
01:22:56,889 --> 01:22:58,766
Smurfs, run!

1382
01:23:00,559 --> 01:23:02,232
Smurfs.

1383
01:23:07,858 --> 01:23:11,613
You have our Papa. Prepare to get smurf ed!

1384
01:23:11,737 --> 01:23:13,410
Yeah, what he said.

1385
01:23:13,530 --> 01:23:15,032
Adorable.

1386
01:23:15,115 --> 01:23:18,745
Two little smurfs come to save
their beloved Papa.

1387
01:23:19,077 --> 01:23:20,579
Hey, Gargamel.

1388
01:23:21,246 --> 01:23:24,045
Make that three little smurfs.

1389
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:31,052
And I went home and got a few friends.

1390
01:23:52,110 --> 01:23:53,657
MY, my, my!

1391
01:23:54,488 --> 01:23:56,115
I think the whole village must be here.

1392
01:23:57,616 --> 01:24:02,247
Whatever will I do with all this essence?

1393
01:24:02,788 --> 01:24:04,165
On me, boys.

1394
01:24:05,749 --> 01:24:06,796
Fire!

1395
01:24:06,917 --> 01:24:09,261
Let's get this hoedown started!

1396
01:24:09,836 --> 01:24:12,885
There comes a time
when every Smurf must stand up...

1397
01:24:12,965 --> 01:24:14,091
Watch it, you little hoodlums!

1398
01:24:14,174 --> 01:24:17,553
For what is good and cute and blue
in the world.

1399
01:24:17,636 --> 01:24:21,391
And on this brisk New York night,
that time is now.

1400
01:24:21,473 --> 01:24:23,146
Hey! Seriously?

1401
01:24:23,267 --> 01:24:25,645
Sorry, it's kind of what I do.

1402
01:24:28,647 --> 01:24:30,149
Eat yolk, Gargamel!

1403
01:24:33,110 --> 01:24:34,657
Patrick, can you do it?

1404
01:24:34,778 --> 01:24:35,825
Go, go, go!

1405
01:24:36,196 --> 01:24:37,493
Hurry, they can't hold out for long.

1406
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:44,376
You know, one bad apple
can ruin your whole day.

1407
01:24:46,957 --> 01:24:48,709
Full smurf ahead!

1408
01:24:49,001 --> 01:24:50,378
Come on!

1409
01:24:52,629 --> 01:24:55,553
Hey, Gargamel,
here's a little souvenir from the Big Apple.

1410
01:24:59,177 --> 01:25:01,555
- Out of the frying pan...
- And into the...

1411
01:25:01,805 --> 01:25:02,806
- Fire.
- Fire.

1412
01:25:02,889 --> 01:25:04,732
I'm too beautiful to die!

1413
01:25:15,027 --> 01:25:16,028
Oh, Papa.

1414
01:25:16,278 --> 01:25:18,121
No. No, Smurfette.

1415
01:25:18,196 --> 01:25:20,119
What did he do to you?

1416
01:25:20,198 --> 01:25:21,324
You shouldn't have come back for me.

1417
01:25:21,408 --> 01:25:23,410
Papa, I'm getting you out of here right now.

1418
01:25:27,956 --> 01:25:29,003
Smurfette!

1419
01:25:29,082 --> 01:25:31,050
Hang on, Papa, I'll be back.

1420
01:25:34,588 --> 01:25:35,885
Charge!

1421
01:25:35,964 --> 01:25:37,011
Get him!

1422
01:25:37,090 --> 01:25:38,182
Grab the wand!

1423
01:25:38,258 --> 01:25:39,475
- Goin' in!
- Go!

1424
01:25:42,804 --> 01:25:43,851
Bombs away!

1425
01:25:43,930 --> 01:25:46,399
- I'm going for a strike!
- Alakazam!

1426
01:25:47,934 --> 01:25:49,607
- Crikey.
- Look out, Gutsy!

1427
01:25:50,937 --> 01:25:52,314
Oh, ya blinkin' flip!

1428
01:25:55,651 --> 01:25:56,823
Hang on, Papa.

1429
01:26:00,447 --> 01:26:01,494
Onions!

1430
01:26:03,950 --> 01:26:05,122
Get back, cat.

1431
01:26:11,750 --> 01:26:13,002
Here, kitty, kitty...

1432
01:26:15,921 --> 01:26:17,093
Smurfette!

1433
01:26:19,841 --> 01:26:21,093
Looking for me?

1434
01:26:21,593 --> 01:26:23,140
Play time is over!

1435
01:26:23,637 --> 01:26:27,312
Behold the awesome power of me!

1436
01:26:57,045 --> 01:26:58,137
Smurfette?

1437
01:26:58,296 --> 01:26:59,843
Had enough, huh?

1438
01:27:00,173 --> 01:27:01,299
You're mine, kitty.

1439
01:27:05,137 --> 01:27:07,139
I'm done smurfing around.

1440
01:27:16,815 --> 01:27:19,034
You smurf ed with the wrong girl.

1441
01:27:23,238 --> 01:27:24,740
- I got you, Greedy.
- Oh, my cupcake!

1442
01:27:28,702 --> 01:27:30,170
What's happening, Papa?

1443
01:27:30,495 --> 01:27:31,496
No!

1444
01:27:32,664 --> 01:27:35,338
Gargamel!

1445
01:27:36,376 --> 01:27:39,175
Not so fast, goody blue-shoes.

1446
01:27:39,671 --> 01:27:41,173
Oh, Papa!

1447
01:27:42,674 --> 01:27:46,224
Now, it's time to break their little blue wills.

1448
01:27:46,678 --> 01:27:49,522
- No.
- Are you watching closely, Smurfs?

1449
01:27:49,848 --> 01:27:52,567
- Papa!
- Your beloved little Papa

1450
01:27:52,684 --> 01:27:56,029
is about to meet his little blue end.

1451
01:27:56,104 --> 01:27:57,151
No!

1452
01:27:57,230 --> 01:27:58,698
Upsy-daisy!

1453
01:27:58,857 --> 01:28:00,530
Oh, no. Papa!

1454
01:28:00,609 --> 01:28:01,701
Papa!

1455
01:28:05,697 --> 01:28:08,792
No! No!

1456
01:28:08,867 --> 01:28:09,959
You again!

1457
01:28:10,035 --> 01:28:11,207
Goodbye!

1458
01:28:12,287 --> 01:28:13,379
I'm really...

1459
01:28:13,872 --> 01:28:16,876
This ends here, this ends now!

1460
01:28:16,958 --> 01:28:18,756
Really going to enjoy this.

1461
01:28:19,044 --> 01:28:20,216
Gotcha!

1462
01:28:20,712 --> 01:28:22,305
Freedom!

1463
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:23,927
Son of a smurf!

1464
01:28:24,132 --> 01:28:25,475
Come back here!

1465
01:28:25,550 --> 01:28:27,723
Go, Gutsy! Yeah!

1466
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:31,473
Come back here right now with my wand!

1467
01:28:32,891 --> 01:28:34,939
Oh, no. Crikey.

1468
01:28:38,772 --> 01:28:40,900
I... I got it.

1469
01:28:41,233 --> 01:28:43,327
- Oh, dear.
- Clumsy.

1470
01:28:43,401 --> 01:28:46,826
- So this is how it ends.
- Our goose is cooked.

1471
01:28:49,491 --> 01:28:51,960
- This is not gonna be good.
- We're doomed.

1472
01:28:52,619 --> 01:28:54,417
I got it! I got it!

1473
01:28:55,747 --> 01:28:58,466
The vision's never been wrong.

1474
01:29:11,263 --> 01:29:12,606
I got it!

1475
01:29:14,474 --> 01:29:17,273
My wand! Give me back my wand!

1476
01:29:32,325 --> 01:29:33,622
How dare you!

1477
01:29:35,662 --> 01:29:39,633
How dare you defy the great and powerful...

1478
01:29:44,629 --> 01:29:45,721
Oh, my God.

1479
01:29:45,797 --> 01:29:47,470
Smurfs!

1480
01:29:52,137 --> 01:29:53,730
Are you dead?

1481
01:29:58,310 --> 01:30:00,563
- Nice one, Clumsy!
- Are you kidding me?

1482
01:30:00,645 --> 01:30:02,238
- Get up here, you!
- Yeah!

1483
01:30:02,981 --> 01:30:05,530
Bravo! Danke schön, Clumsy!

1484
01:30:06,234 --> 01:30:07,827
- Patrick.
- Hey.

1485
01:30:08,194 --> 01:30:11,664
Clumsy! Clumsy! Clumsy! Clumsy!

1486
01:30:14,492 --> 01:30:16,745
Clumsy, you're a hero.

1487
01:30:16,828 --> 01:30:18,045
I'm a hero?

1488
01:30:18,204 --> 01:30:19,376
Yeah. Yeah.

1489
01:30:19,831 --> 01:30:24,678
I'm a hero! I'm so sorry, guys.
Definitely killed the moment.

1490
01:30:25,378 --> 01:30:28,848
- Clumsy, you little mook, you.
- It's Papa.

1491
01:30:30,050 --> 01:30:32,348
I owe you an apology, Clumsy.

1492
01:30:32,719 --> 01:30:36,019
I believed more in a vision than I did in you.

1493
01:30:37,349 --> 01:30:39,192
I'm so proud of you, Clumsy.

1494
01:30:39,517 --> 01:30:41,019
Thanks, Papa.

1495
01:30:41,853 --> 01:30:44,356
I promised myself I wouldn't cry.

1496
01:30:44,606 --> 01:30:46,950
And now to get rid of this!

1497
01:30:52,447 --> 01:30:55,917
To the portal, everyone!
There's no time to spare.

1498
01:30:56,534 --> 01:30:58,707
- Smurf y'all later!
- Bye.

1499
01:31:01,039 --> 01:31:02,666
I'm not one for long goodbyes,

1500
01:31:02,749 --> 01:31:06,253
but I did smurf together a few words
I'd like to say.

1501
01:31:06,378 --> 01:31:07,470
- Bye.
- Take care.

1502
01:31:07,545 --> 01:31:10,765
I hated this. So much less than I expected.

1503
01:31:11,091 --> 01:31:14,766
- Bye, Grouchy.
- Don't get me wrong, I still hated it. Just less.

1504
01:31:14,886 --> 01:31:20,063
I'll not soon forget this place.
Especially not with these! Tallyho!

1505
01:31:20,642 --> 01:31:23,441
I shall be back, Broadway. Tootles!

1506
01:31:23,561 --> 01:31:25,404
- Hey, girlfriend.
- Wow.

1507
01:31:26,064 --> 01:31:28,317
I've never had a girlfriend before.

1508
01:31:30,485 --> 01:31:33,830
- I'll never forget you.
- Smurfette.

1509
01:31:35,073 --> 01:31:36,074
High four.

1510
01:31:38,118 --> 01:31:39,916
High four, Grace.

1511
01:31:41,246 --> 01:31:43,123
- Hey, Smurfette.
- And you.

1512
01:31:43,248 --> 01:31:45,296
- Hi.
- You, the little hero, come here.

1513
01:31:45,917 --> 01:31:47,919
Hero? Stop.

1514
01:31:48,586 --> 01:31:50,964
Well, actually, you mind saying
it one more time?

1515
01:31:51,089 --> 01:31:52,636
It's kinda got a nice ring to it.

1516
01:31:58,304 --> 01:32:01,433
- Bye, Grace.
- Well, Master Winslow, thank you.

1517
01:32:02,100 --> 01:32:04,102
- You saved me.
- So long!

1518
01:32:04,644 --> 01:32:06,271
You saved my whole family.

1519
01:32:06,479 --> 01:32:09,608
Actually I think it was the other way around.

1520
01:32:10,108 --> 01:32:14,113
Well, I should get going.
I've got a Smurf village to rebuild.

1521
01:32:14,446 --> 01:32:16,665
Your village has given me some ideas.

1522
01:32:17,949 --> 01:32:19,292
Come here.

1523
01:32:28,334 --> 01:32:29,881
Goodbye, Papa.

1524
01:32:30,628 --> 01:32:32,972
Goodbye, Papa.

1525
01:32:39,888 --> 01:32:41,481
Let's go home.

1526
01:32:44,642 --> 01:32:48,738
And so, the Smurfs left
the strange city of New York,

1527
01:32:49,314 --> 01:32:53,615
and I think they left it a little sweeter,
a little wiser,

1528
01:32:53,693 --> 01:32:55,912
a little smurfier.

1529
01:32:55,987 --> 01:32:58,661
And as that portal began to close
for the last time...

1530
01:32:58,740 --> 01:33:00,913
Hey! Seriously, stop!

1531
01:33:01,910 --> 01:33:03,833
Bye, New York!

1532
01:33:13,671 --> 01:33:15,844
It's Odile. Hey, Odile.

1533
01:33:15,924 --> 01:33:18,347
Patrick, I just called to say thank you.

1534
01:33:19,552 --> 01:33:21,850
Finally someone has given me what I want.

1535
01:33:29,687 --> 01:33:30,859
I think I'm not fired.

1536
01:33:32,273 --> 01:33:33,365
Wow!

1537
01:33:37,362 --> 01:33:40,957
Wow. So that's a new job, new baby,

1538
01:33:42,534 --> 01:33:44,628
some unique new friends...

1539
01:33:49,415 --> 01:33:51,588
- You know if you really want a bigger place.
- Bigger?

1540
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:54,964
Are you crazy? Then we'll be further apart.

1541
01:34:00,552 --> 01:34:01,599
Grace,

1542
01:34:04,889 --> 01:34:06,232
I smurf you.

1543
01:36:05,343 --> 01:36:07,562
Smurfs. Smurfs!

1544
01:36:12,183 --> 01:36:15,232
I wish I could quit you. Get out of here.

1545
01:36:18,940 --> 01:36:20,692
What are you looking at?

1546
01:36:21,305 --> 01:37:21,751
