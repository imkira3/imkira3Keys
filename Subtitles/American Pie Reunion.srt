
2
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:04,607
Yeah, I'll go put him to bed.

3
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:11,038
R. Kelly always does the trick.

4
00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:15,167
I think Evan may be
developing a rash.

5
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:17,498
You know, when you rub
the Aquaphor on his tush,

6
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:19,080
you can't just
put it on his cheeks,

7
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:21,256
you have to rub it
all over the anus, too.

8
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,333
All over the anus, got it.

9
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:27,050
I think I'm going
to take a bath, okay?

10
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:29,886
Okay, babe. Go for it.

11
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,537
Not this time.

12
00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:01,372
Okay, come on, come on, come
on, come on, come on. Okay.

13
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:05,713
Yep.

14
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,802
<i>Oh, yeah, you like
it nasty, don't you?</i>

15
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:14,385
Oh, I do. I do, I'm sorry.
Guilty as charged.

16
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:16,603
<i>God, you're so big, it hurts.</i>

17
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:18,605
I know, I can't help it.

18
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:19,936
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

19
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:21,224
<i>Give it to me, daddy. Oh,</i> yeah.

20
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:22,776
<i>Give it to me, daddy.
Give it to me... Oh, yeah.</i>

21
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:24,186
Daddy?

22
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:28,024
Evan! What the...

23
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,567
You're opening doors now?
How did...

24
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,868
I saw a monster. A what?

25
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:33,745
<i>Stick your
finger in my asshole.</i>

26
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:34,951
God.

27
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:36,205
<i>Fuck, yeah! Fuck, yeah!</i>

28
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:37,533
<i>Come on, come on, come on.
Fuck, yeah!</i>

29
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,417
<i>I want you to come
all over</i> my...

30
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:41,578
Oh, my God!

31
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:47,421
Evan, don't touch that!

32
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:48,836
Don't...

33
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:51,759
Daddy, boo-boo.

34
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:53,761
What the...

35
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,847
Oh, my God.

36
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:57,553
Okay, don't move. Stay here.

37
00:02:57,636 --> 00:02:59,388
Daddy needs a Band-Aid.

38
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:05,439
Michelle?

39
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:08,438
Do you...

40
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,071
Mommy, Daddy, are you okay?

41
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:47,568
Jim Levenstein.

42
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,988
They still haven't gotten
you an assistant yet, huh?

43
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:52,775
Kev, I'm sorry, I've been
meaning to call you back.

44
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,614
I've just been... <i>Busy?</i>

45
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:55,993
I get it.

46
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:57,655
Look, I'll make
this quick, okay?

47
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,828
The reunion, you in?

48
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:02,789
Hold on, is that
really happening?

49
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,328
Yeah, man, check your Facebook.

50
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,246
<i>Look, I know they missed
the ten-year by a couple,</i>

51
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,832
<i>but, you know, seems like
people are actually going.</i>

52
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,176
Hey, hon. Hey!

53
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,299
Mmm. Dinner smells great.

54
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:14,429
Hey, Ellie.

55
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:15,505
Hey, Jim.

56
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:17,682
<i>Ooh, Bachelorette finale later.</i>

57
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:20,810
And don't forget, we still
have to watch <i>Real</i> Housewives.

58
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:23,017
Yeah, how could I forget?

59
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,148
Hey, Kev, you know who
my favorite housewife is?

60
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:27,313
<i>You.</i>

61
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:28,693
Very funny.

62
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:33,028
Look, I love my wife, but I
need a weekend with the guys.

63
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,239
<i>Come on, we'll go a few days early.
No Stifler this time.</i>

64
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:39,029
Just you, me, Oz and Finch.

65
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:40,823
Yeah, well,
good luck with that.

66
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:43,663
I heard Finch's mom doesn't
even know where he is.

67
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:44,917
And what about Oz?

68
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:48,338
I mean, do you really think he would
come with all he has going on?

69
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,884
And we're back
here on Sports View,

70
00:04:56,963 --> 00:05:00,388
with my special guest,
Chad Ochocinco.

71
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,178
Chad, which college
football powerhouse

72
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:06,098
is gonna have the most players
drafted in this year's draft?

73
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:09,188
I'm gonna have to go with my
alma mater, the Oregon State.

74
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:12,571
Come on, man!
What are you smoking, Ocho?

75
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,481
<i>You think I don't know
what I'm talking about?</i>

76
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,737
<i>Do me a favor,
take a look at the tape.</i>

77
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,073
Hey, babe, I'm home!

78
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:22,581
<i>And that wraps it up for my
special guest, Chad Ochocinco.</i>

79
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:27,415
<i>This is Chris Ostreicher reminding
you to play on, plava!</i>

80
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:38,050
Hey, Mia?

81
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:42,843
Oh, my gosh!
So funny.

82
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:46,972
Oh, hey, baby!

83
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:48,603
Hi!

84
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,642
I was just watching
your show a minute ago.

85
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:51,772
Oh, yeah?

86
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:53,027
Is everything okay?

87
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,939
You tell me. You're in the
hot tub with another dude.

88
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:57,449
You are worried about Deshaun?

89
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,776
Aw, that is so cute!

90
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:02,913
Deshaun's the interior
decorator I told you about.

91
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,539
Hey, Christopher!

92
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,951
Strip down! Come join us.

93
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:10,420
Maybe next time, Deshaun.

94
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:15,922
I still don't get why we
need an interior decorator.

95
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:19,213
Because the place needs to look
perfect for the InStyle shoot.

96
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,972
Babe, trust me.

97
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:23,509
Remember how you didn't wanna go
on Celebrity Dance Off at first?

98
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,893
Now think of all
the fans you have.

99
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:30,728
Oh! I almost forgot, Mario Lopez
is having a Memorial Day party.

100
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:32,726
I told him we're in.

101
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:36,564
Actually,
I was thinking about going

102
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:39,069
to my high school
reunion that weekend.

103
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,949
Well, if you're going,
I'm going, too.

104
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,783
Really? Yeah.

105
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:45,947
All right.

106
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:48,375
Mia, love, phone call.
It's Rumer.

107
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,293
Oh, shit, let me talk to her.

108
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:53,751
What's with you jacking
my style, bitch?

109
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,629
Anything I can
get for you, Christopher?

110
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,013
Uh...

111
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:21,321
Morning, co-workers
and cock-jerkers!

112
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,280
Reggie, give me some love.

113
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,953
Looking good, Stifler.

114
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:27,781
Ladies, better be working hard,

115
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:29,286
you weren't hired
for your looks.

116
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:31,039
Actually, you were.

117
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:32,665
Not you.

118
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:35,959
Seriously?

119
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,089
Bob, what are you doing here?

120
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,420
Don't you know
they fired your ass?

121
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:42,595
What?

122
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:44,514
I'm just fucking with you.

123
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:45,799
Or am I?

124
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,600
Hey!

125
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:51,730
Coffee for the pretty lady?

126
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:53,686
Sure, thanks.

127
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,816
Let me know if you want
some creamer with that.

128
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:04,905
Hello, you. How are you?

129
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:06,593
"Oh, I'm good, Stifmeister,
'cause you know what?

130
00:08:06,594 --> 00:08:08,117
'Cause you're the best."

131
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,494
"Oh, I am the best."
"Yes, you are the..."

132
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:13,786
"You know, I love you so much that I'm
going to just have some fun down here."

133
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,285
"Oh, yeah, yeah..."

134
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:17,664
What the hell are you doing?
Jesus Christ!

135
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:21,043
Shit, sorry, Mr. Duraiswamy
It's... I was just...

136
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,168
Huh?
That's good, it's all clean.

137
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:25,005
I told you to print out the morning
numbers and put them on my desk,

138
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:26,635
and you're making
yourself at home?

139
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,554
No, I just thought...
"I just thought..."

140
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,102
I don't pay you to think.
You are a temp.

141
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:34,432
Yeah, about that. I feel like I'm
being way underutilized here.

142
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:36,854
Oh, you do, do you?

143
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,935
Thank you for telling
me how you feel.

144
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:40,729
Do you mind if I
tell you how I feel?

145
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:44,942
I feel the sooner you realize
that you're the bitch,

146
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,027
not the boss,

147
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:50,410
the better
off you will be.

148
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,832
Fucker.
What was that?

149
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,117
Nothing!

150
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,419
Nothing, Mr. Duraiswamy.

151
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,254
Fucker!

152
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:09,178
You know, we still haven't
discussed the whole

153
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,558
bathtub incident.

154
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,728
Huh? Oh, that? That's...

155
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,060
That“ Don't worry about that.

156
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,980
Well, I mean,
you know, obviously,

157
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,688
I would prefer it
if I was the one

158
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:25,024
that made you
feel that way, but...

159
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,692
I know how you feel.

160
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:30,863
Every time I want to shop online
and I start typing "Amazon,"

161
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:35,535
"amazingcollegesluts.com"
pops up.

162
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,457
Amazing what?

163
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:41,915
Okay, look, obviously

164
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:47,596
we need to have
more fun together.

165
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:49,552
I promise you, this weekend,

166
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:54,060
there is going to be plenty of
Jim and Michelle time, okay?

167
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:02,985
Hey!

168
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:04,108
Hello, sweetheart.

169
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:05,530
How are you? Oh!

170
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:07,240
It's so good to see you.
- Hey, Dad.

171
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,113
Hello, son! Come here.

172
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:11,695
Hi! Hi!

173
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,746
Oh, no!
Look who that is!

174
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:17,452
Look at this big bruiser!
Oh, my goodness!

175
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,211
He has grown.
- Look at him! Huh?

176
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,794
Someone's got
a little poopy diaper.

177
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,031
Jim?

178
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,542
I can't believe it's you.

179
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,878
You don't remember me, do you?

180
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:10,379
Uh...
Remember Teletubby Tuesdays?

181
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:12,923
Kara?

182
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,762
Oh, my God.

183
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:19,434
What? You're not
a kid any more.

184
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:22,065
It's been a long time since
I needed a babysitter.

185
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:26,103
I can't believe how
much you've grown up.

186
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:27,316
Thanks!

187
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,397
It's actually my 18th
birthday tomorrow.

188
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:30,565
Eighteen, wow.

189
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,237
You should come to my party.

190
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:33,318
Oh, uh...

191
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:35,571
Thank you, no. I...
Yeah, that might be difficult.

192
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,530
Please, I want you
to come so bad.

193
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:42,126
Hey, Kara! We gotta go.

194
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:44,454
Okay, relax.

195
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,377
That's AJ. Don't ask.

196
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,542
Hopefully I will
see you tomorrow.

197
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,133
What?
- Who the fuck was that?

198
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,881
Hey, sweetie.

199
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:55,965
Hey.

200
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,224
Who were you talking to?

201
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,803
That was just
the kid next door.

202
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,629
Hello, my old friends.

203
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:37,015
I thought about
throwing them out,

204
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:41,432
but they just have
too much sentimental value.

205
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:42,641
Yeah.

206
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:46,266
Oh, Jim, Jim, Jim.

207
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,363
You know, I can remember when
you were just a little guy.

208
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:54,445
And now you've got
your own little guy.

209
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:55,608
I know.

210
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:58,411
And before you know it,
he's gonna be a teenager...

211
00:12:58,486 --> 00:12:59,612
Wow.

212
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:03,121
And you'll be teaching him
about masturbation

213
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:05,786
and, you know, all the
do's and all the don'ts

214
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,211
that have to do with
the little guy's weenie.

215
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:08,288
Right? Okay?

216
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:11,124
Hopefully, it'll be more of a bratwurst
by the time he's a teenager...

217
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:12,424
Okay, Dad, I get it.
...but I'm just...

218
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,002
Well, these are things you're
gonna have to deal with.

219
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:15,758
I understand. It's just,
you know, he's two.

220
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:17,680
Well, yeah, maybe
you've got time, but..

221
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:20,725
So, you know, I just, I'd rather
not talk about his penis.

222
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,928
How you doing, Dad? I'm good.

223
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:26,106
Yeah? What are you doing for fun?
You seen any movies lately?

224
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:29,897
Well, you know, your mother and
I did go to a lot of movies.

225
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:32,645
Well...

226
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:38,243
You know, it has been three
years since she passed, Dad.

227
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:41,571
There's gotta be someone in
town you can see a movie with.

228
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:45,033
I have you now.
We'll see a movie tonight, you and me.

229
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:47,085
Tonight?

230
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:48,878
Well, I made plans
with the guys,

231
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:50,671
to meet up with them
tonight at the bar... Oh.

232
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:51,919
But... Yeah, yeah...

233
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:54,672
But I don't need to do that.
I can do that tomorrow.

234
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:57,425
No. No, no, no, no.
This is why you're in town, isn't it?

235
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:59,840
No, no, no.
You go. I'll be fine.

236
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:02,141
I was just planning
on staying in tonight

237
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:03,934
and, you know,
doing a little reading.

238
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:10,433
Oh, not this. No. No.

239
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:15,610
Although, I do remember reading
a very interesting article

240
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:18,616
on something Brazilian.

241
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:22,200
Boy, these pages are all
stuck together here.

242
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:25,911
I got it.

243
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:35,625
Kev.

244
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:37,589
Hey!

245
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,801
What's up, man? Jim.

246
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:42,136
Hey, guys!

247
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:43,758
Oz. There he is.

248
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:44,888
You made it.

249
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,846
Hey, I missed your wedding,
I wasn't gonna miss this.

250
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,643
Hey, buddy. What's up, pal?

251
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:51,479
Good to see you. Yeah, man.

252
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:53,143
Hey, Kev!

253
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:54,523
Looking good, look at you!

254
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,400
Oh, stop it. Come on.

255
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,163
Gentlemen.

256
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:16,291
Finch? Finch!

257
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:17,421
Oh, my God!
It great to see you, James.

258
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,467
Changed at all, Jim.

259
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:19,544
Good to see you, pal.

260
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:20,674
I didn't think you
were gonna make it.

261
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:21,754
Finch, how are you, man?

262
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:26,761
So, after my troubles in Beijing,
I just moved to Dubai,

263
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:30,100
and then I got all caught up in the
world of underground baccarat.

264
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:33,563
Spent the rest of '09 living
with this African tribe.

265
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:36,815
Oh, they made me
an honorary tribesman.

266
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:37,937
Oh.

267
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,359
Whoa, that looks like it hurt.

268
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:41,524
It looks like that
because it did hurt, Kevin.

269
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:45,696
Since then, I've just been
biking through South America.

270
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:48,786
So, basically, you are the most
interesting man in the world.

271
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:51,038
Yeah. Let me guess,

272
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,662
you guys are here
for the reunion, huh?

273
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:55,830
You got it. Class of '99.

274
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:57,544
Haven I seen you before?

275
00:15:57,707 --> 00:15:59,801
Yeah, I'm on TV.

276
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,337
No, not you. You.

277
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:07,888
'Cause, your face,
you're just so familiar.

278
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,644
Yeah! Yeah, this is you, right?

279
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,643
Oh! Man, Nadia!

280
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:15,191
<i>More, more, you bad boy!</i>

281
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:17,477
I swear I had these all taken down.
How did you...

282
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,654
Oh, yeah. How many times did
you pre-ejaculate again?

283
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:21,197
Oh, leave him alone.

284
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:24,359
I bet you were all desperate
virgins back then.

285
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,242
Selena Vega.

286
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:32,663
That's Selena Vega in front of us.
Wait, wait, wait, Selena...

287
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:34,744
Hold on, Michelle's
friend from band?

288
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:35,828
You got it.

289
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:37,710
Oh, my God. I'm sorry
I didn't recognize you.

290
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:39,215
You look

291
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:40,666
different.

292
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:43,670
Well, next round's
on me, okay, guys?

293
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,843
Hey, that chick was in band?

294
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:49,434
This is the first long weekend
I have had in a while

295
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:50,761
so I wanna make it count.

296
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:54,056
I want the place spotless, and
I want it filled with booze.

297
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:56,145
And I wanna make sure you're
not around on Sunday night,

298
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:58,192
'cause I plan on bringing some
ass back from the reunion,

299
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,861
and I wanna tap that without you there.
You got it?

300
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,274
You know, first of all,
Steven, it's my house.

301
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,067
You're lucky I'm
letting you stay here.

302
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,361
Look, you wanted me to
get a job, so I got one.

303
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,201
At least let me have the
house for the weekend.

304
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,616
My house, my rules.

305
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:15,080
<i>And as for tonight, if you
don't wanna risk coming home</i>

306
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:16,870
<i>and seeing more of your
mother than you'd like,</i>

307
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,710
I suggest you stay out late.

308
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,000
Gross.

309
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:28,306
That was really...

310
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,682
Hey, bar wench,
can I get a Budweiser?

311
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,471
Beer down.

312
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:40,359
What the fuck are you
fuckers doing here?

313
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:49,031
You made it! Made what?

314
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,157
What are you talking about?

315
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:53,243
What do you mean?
We sent you an e-mail

316
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:56,125
about getting together a couple
of days before the reunion.

317
00:17:56,284 --> 00:18:00,209
You know what? I must have put
two F's in "Stifmeister."

318
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:01,793
What? KEVIN: I'm sorry.

319
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:08,008
Two F's? You dumbass!

320
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,384
Kev!

321
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,340
Hey, Kevin, is that
a pussy on your face?

322
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:12,801
Oh, come on!

323
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:14,685
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

324
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,886
Nice.

325
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,643
So, Stifler,
you're looking sharp.

326
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:19,144
What are you up to these days?

327
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:21,601
I work at JBH Global.

328
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:23,686
Wow! That's a big-time firm.

329
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:24,937
What do you do over there?

330
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:27,189
Oh, you know,

331
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,366
investment stuff.

332
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:32,203
People wonder why our financial
system's falling apart.

333
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:35,327
Nice scarf. I see you finally
came out of the closet.

334
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:37,036
How is your mother, Stifler?

335
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:38,917
You stay away from
my mom, shitbreak.

336
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:41,579
Okay, boys,
the past is the past.

337
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,289
We can bury
the hatchet here, huh?

338
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,045
Yeah, fuck it.

339
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,960
Hey, short-shorts!
A round of Jägerbombs for me and my boys!

340
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,470
Go fuck yourself, Stifler.

341
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:52,011
How the hell does
she know my name?

342
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:55,055
Lard Arms?

343
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,306
Jesus, Stifler.

344
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:59,354
Talk about an ugly duckling
turning into a swan, right?

345
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,350
Let me see that.

346
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:08,774
Oh! Fingered her,
hairy nips, huge boobs.

347
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:11,443
Oh.

348
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:13,619
There she is!

349
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,738
<i>The créme de my cock.</i>

350
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:17,573
Blowjob Lipstein.

351
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:21,082
Her given name
was Loni, Stifler.

352
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,962
She used to call me Big Stiffy.

353
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,963
She was the mouth
that got away.

354
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,172
Last call!

355
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:32,464
Already? Wait here, guys.

356
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:35,933
Oh! Man, the Senior Wish List.

357
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,060
Wish List?
I don't remember that.

358
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:40,854
Oh, yeah, man.
It's that cheesy page in the yearbook

359
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:43,058
where we all had to write
wishes about our future.

360
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,019
What, did you write something cheesy?
Let's see.

361
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:50,941
"Chris Ostreicher.
Hopes to coach his son's lacrosse team."

362
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,242
Oh! Isn't that the
sweetest thing?

363
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,534
Well,

364
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,742
I guess I thought
I'd have a family by now.

365
00:19:57,822 --> 00:19:59,119
All right, you wanna hear
what you wrote, Finch?

366
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,290
I do.

367
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:04,249
"Paul Finch hopes to
find le grand amour."

368
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,539
Yes, true love.

369
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:11,256
Alas, I have yet to find what you
would call a real relationship.

370
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:14,047
Right, because banging
Stifler's mom didn't count.

371
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,262
All right, let's see
what you got, Kev.

372
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:20,850
"Kevin Myers. Hopes to
still be living it up"

373
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:24,106
"with the amazing
Vicky Lathum."

374
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:25,562
Oh, man! Vicky! What?

375
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:28,023
I am sure your wife would
be very happy to read that.

376
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:30,938
What? I was dating
Vicky at the time.

377
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:32,447
Let me see what I put.

378
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:35,902
"Jim Levenstein"

379
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:45,086
"hopes to have the
sex life of Ricky Martin."

380
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:50,917
So, I'm assuming you didn't
know he was gay back then.

381
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,672
Jim, it's a good thing
you found a woman

382
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:54,595
with the sex drive
of a dozen groupies. Hmm?

383
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:57,006
I mean, you're probably having
more sex than any of us.

384
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,350
Probably, you know.

385
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:03,513
Hope you guys are thirsty.
Stifler Claus is here.

386
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,273
Whoa! Stifler, that's a little
too much, don't you think?

387
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:08,526
Dude, find your balls
and return them to your sack.

388
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:10,690
I say we keep this party going.

389
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,693
I say we make this
weekend our bitch.

390
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:16,325
We could party together, do all the
same shit that we used to do together.

391
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:17,827
It'll be just like old times.

392
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:20,659
Hell yes! That's why I'm here.

393
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:23,324
<i>No Bachelorette,
no Real Housewives.</i>

394
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:27,041
Thing is, you only get one
chance at your 13th reunion.

395
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,583
I was kind of hoping to spend
a little time with the wife.

396
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:33,709
Fuck! Dude!

397
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:36,171
James? What? Come on!

398
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,014
I mean, I'm in. Of course I'm in.
Come on, what?

399
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:40,174
Yeah! Yeah.

400
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:43,932
Then, gentlemen, I hope you're
all wearing protection,

401
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:46,142
because this weekend,
we're gonna fuck shit up!

402
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:47,978
- Cheers!
- Yeah! All right!

403
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:10,626
What the fuck?

404
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:14,174
Holy shit.

405
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:19,676
Hey!

406
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,261
Hi.

407
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:23,683
What happened?

408
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:28,435
I don't really remember.

409
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:32,522
I blame you. How much did you
let him drink last night?

410
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:35,404
Honestly,
not that much.

411
00:22:35,563 --> 00:22:38,783
Well, we gotta clean this up
before we go to the lake.

412
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:42,036
What? The lake?

413
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:45,285
Yeah, the lake, dude.
It was your idea.

414
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:48,000
We discussed
all this last night.

415
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:50,377
Oh, the lake!
Yes, of course, the...

416
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:52,755
Hey, Jim, can you hand me
those paper towels, please?

417
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:58,469
Oh, those paper towels?
The paper ones.

418
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:00,553
Uh...

419
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,390
The paper towels, Jim.

420
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,471
Jim! Yeah...

421
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:07,019
The paper towels!

422
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,478
I'm really sorry.

423
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:20,525
Jim, you do realize that
the lid is see-through, right?

424
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:25,158
Oh, wow.

425
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:29,579
Good eye.

426
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:33,166
That's the father of my child.

427
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,144
Oh, come on!

428
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:51,722
Hey, watch it! Okay, jeez.

429
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:55,439
Am I wrong, or was this place a lot
more fun when we were younger?

430
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:58,775
No, no. I think it's the same.
We're just old now.

431
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:03,154
But were we just as obnoxious
as these kids back in the day?

432
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:04,489
No.

433
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,329
Us, our generation,
we were more mature.

434
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:09,161
Hey, guys, check it out.

435
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,659
Vagina shark!

436
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,584
He touched my snatch!

437
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:18,833
I take that back.

438
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:29,260
Oh, my God.

439
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,183
Fellas, do you gotta stare?

440
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:32,346
Yeah. Yeah.

441
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:34,106
Yes, we do need to stare.

442
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:39,149
Could Jim
be any more obvious?

443
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:41,735
Oh, give him a break.

444
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:45,492
I mean, it's not every day you get to see
a model walking around off the page.

445
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:49,990
There hasn't been
a whole lot of sexy time

446
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:52,120
in the Levenstein
household lately.

447
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,200
Why not?

448
00:24:54,118 --> 00:24:56,997
I don't know. I'm a mom now.

449
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:59,377
Oh, please!

450
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,463
Just because you're
a mom doesn't mean

451
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:04,091
there isn't a whole other side to you.

452
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,969
Hey, remember that
one time at band camp,

453
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,517
when we licked whipped cream
off each other's...

454
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:13,812
Yes! Yes! I remember.

455
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:16,056
Let's keep that
in the past, though, okay?

456
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:19,689
Oh, she's...

457
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:22,446
Yeah, well, you gotta do that, or
else you're gonna get tan lines.

458
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:25,073
Sideboob. There... Sorry.
Sideboob. Ozzy, look!

459
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:27,610
Okay! Come on!

460
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:30,491
You're a lucky man, Oz.

461
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:33,915
Oh, come on, guys.
I think we're all pretty

462
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:36,786
lucky.

463
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:42,299
Wait, is that Heather?

464
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:47,137
Yeah, it is.

465
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:51,633
Heather.

466
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:52,760
Chris!

467
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:54,811
Hey.

468
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:56,479
What are you doing here?

469
00:25:56,638 --> 00:26:00,393
I guess we had
the same idea, huh?

470
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:03,107
Chris, this is Ron,
my boyfriend.

471
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:05,565
Chris Ostreicher, Ron Douglas.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

472
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:06,732
How do you do?

473
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,817
Ron's a cardiologist
at my hospital.

474
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:11,324
A cardiologist. Wow.

475
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:15,037
Yeah. And, hey, listen, my friends call
me Doctor Ron, D-Ron or just Dron.

476
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:16,082
So you feel free.

477
00:26:16,158 --> 00:26:17,705
Okay.

478
00:26:17,785 --> 00:26:18,957
Hey, fuckface!

479
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:21,168
Choir chick! Whoa!

480
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:23,590
Nice to see you, too, Stifler.

481
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:24,792
Who's this douche?

482
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,173
I'm her boyfriend.

483
00:26:28,504 --> 00:26:30,632
So, you two are banging,

484
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:33,259
and you two used to bang.

485
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:36,266
This must be awkward
for all of you.

486
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:38,097
It is now.

487
00:26:39,807 --> 00:26:41,650
That little shit took my top!

488
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:43,152
Give it back!

489
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:47,149
Um, that's my girlfriend.

490
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:50,609
What's this? What's this?

491
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:54,789
Hey, kid!
What do you think you're doing?

492
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:57,541
Hey!
Come on, come on, let's go!

493
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:59,827
Come on, guys. Not cool!

494
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,955
What're you assholes gonna do about it?

495
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,133
Well, that was interesting.

496
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,676
Well, should we do something?

497
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,143
What are we gonna do? Come on.

498
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:20,393
Agreed. There's no need
to stoop to their level.

499
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:21,978
Fuck that!

500
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:24,064
I know exactly
where they're going.

501
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:28,363
Stifler?

502
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:48,417
Where the hell is he?

503
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:49,927
Guys, this is stupid.

504
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:52,213
I really can't keep Michelle waiting.
Can we just head back?

505
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:54,256
Hold on.
Let Stifler do his thing.

506
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:56,517
Yeah, that's what
I'm afraid of.

507
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:05,726
Did you guys see
the look on their faces?

508
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:06,940
Fucking awesome.

509
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:08,570
He is crazy.

510
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:12,858
I think one of those guys
was Kara's babysitter.

511
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:14,033
Which one?

512
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:16,407
You know, the one that
looked like Adam Sandler.

513
00:28:23,911 --> 00:28:26,130
Stifler better not
do anything crazy.

514
00:28:26,288 --> 00:28:27,915
All he's gonna do
is tell them off.

515
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:29,879
I thought he was gonna
cut their jet skis free.

516
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:31,589
What happened to pissing
in their suntan lotion?

517
00:28:31,752 --> 00:28:34,221
Hold on. He told me he was
going to steal their beer.

518
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:36,469
Stifler.

519
00:28:47,768 --> 00:28:50,362
Oh, wait. There he is.

520
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:51,563
All right.

521
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:53,945
Yep, he's
taking their beer.

522
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:56,276
All right, hurry up,
Stifler. Come on.

523
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:59,496
What is he doing?

524
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:01,081
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- Wait.

525
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:02,783
Oh, God! KEVIN: Oh, my God.

526
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:04,080
Steven! No!

527
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,160
Oh, God.

528
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,333
Yo, so you really think Kara's
gonna give it up tonight?

529
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:09,419
She was waiting until she turns 18.
You do the math.

530
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:15,262
The only math I know is you've added
your penis to her vagina zero times.

531
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:22,519
Jennifer's not a skank.

532
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:23,595
Dude, yes, she is.

533
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:24,771
I'm gonna throw up.

534
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:27,274
Oh, my God. That's disgusting.

535
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:28,475
What're you doing?

536
00:29:30,644 --> 00:29:32,362
Hurry up. Come on!

537
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:34,607
Down it, man!
Just chug it! Chug it!

538
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,692
Do it. Do it! Don't puss out.

539
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:38,360
Don't puss out!

540
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:39,444
Let's just go. Let's go.

541
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:40,529
Go, go. Go, go, go, go. Go, go.

542
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:43,707
You want another?

543
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:44,866
For sure.

544
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:49,626
Guys, I'm telling you, tonight is gonna
be the night she promised me a year ago.

545
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:57,800
What the...

546
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,223
Hey! Dipshit!

547
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:10,733
No!

548
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,236
No, no!

549
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,572
Stifler! Are you crazy?

550
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:23,160
Jesus, Stifler, what happened
to just stealing their beer?

551
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:25,245
I know, this is so
much better, right?

552
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:27,205
What?

553
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:29,252
You destroyed
their jet skis.

554
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:31,413
They splashed us.

555
00:30:32,414 --> 00:30:33,415
So...

556
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:40,680
Come on, guys.
That was pretty funny.

557
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,683
Maybe in high school it was funny.
Now it's just a felony.

558
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,014
Only if we get caught.

559
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:47,846
Yeah, you gotta admit, it was nice
giving those kids a little payback.

560
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:50,015
Maybe it was good that they will
learn to respect their elders.

561
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:51,399
Exactly!

562
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:54,232
Hey, give me a second, I gotta
find some toilet paper.

563
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:55,611
That's gross.

564
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:57,989
What's up,
Class of '99-ers?

565
00:30:58,148 --> 00:31:00,116
Oh, my God! Vicky!

566
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:01,193
Hi!

567
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:02,277
Hey!

568
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:03,616
I can't believe you're here.

569
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,288
Yeah, I flew in from
New York last night.

570
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:06,915
I've been hanging
outwith my parents.

571
00:31:07,074 --> 00:31:09,122
They were actually just
talking about you earlier.

572
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:10,831
Really? About what?

573
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:13,463
That time they caught us
making out at the Falls.

574
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:15,044
Oh, right.

575
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:18,093
The Falls. Wow, I haven't
been there in forever.

576
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:20,299
Michelle used to love
going to the Falls.

577
00:31:20,462 --> 00:31:21,805
The place is romance incarnate.

578
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:25,138
Hell, yeah.
I got my first rim job at the Falls.

579
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,426
Okay.

580
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:29,304
Hey, sweetie.

581
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:30,389
Mmm, sweetie pie!

582
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:31,686
Hello.

583
00:31:32,516 --> 00:31:36,566
So, the guys were all talking
about heading over to the Falls.

584
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:39,781
Well, what about
Jim and Michelle time?

585
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:42,154
I was thinking it could
be kind of romantic.

586
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:45,867
Well, I'd love to, but your
dad has been with Ev all day.

587
00:31:45,946 --> 00:31:47,698
Yeah, no, you're right.

588
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:49,866
Okay. Yeah, we'll
just, we'll go home.

589
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:53,082
Oh, no, no.
You go and have fun.

590
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:54,253
Really? Yeah.

591
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:57,924
Just, when you get home,
you just better be ready.

592
00:31:58,083 --> 00:31:59,630
You better be ready.

593
00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:01,340
I'm ready.

594
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:10,642
Um, Stifler, do you know
where you're going?

595
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:13,273
I know this place
like the back of my cock.

596
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:26,244
It looks like
a high school party.

597
00:32:28,155 --> 00:32:29,532
With high school chicks.

598
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:32,830
It's on.

599
00:32:32,993 --> 00:32:35,542
Watch it, Stifler. You know these
girls are, like, half your age.

600
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:36,796
I know.

601
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:46,549
Okay, is it just me, or do girls
today seem a bit sluttier?

602
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:47,762
Definitely.

603
00:32:47,841 --> 00:32:50,890
Teen sex, rainbow parties,
sexting nude photos...

604
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:53,430
I saw it all on
<i>Kathie</i> Lee & Hoda.

605
00:32:53,597 --> 00:32:55,645
Happy birthday!

606
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:03,656
Jim?

607
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:05,783
Kara. You came!

608
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,361
Hey!

609
00:33:08,445 --> 00:33:09,492
Sorry.

610
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:11,914
Happy birthday.

611
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:15,460
Oh, my God,
is this the babysitter?

612
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:16,502
Mmm-hmm.

613
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:19,081
You make it sound like I'm a superhero.

614
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:21,966
Faster than a speeding stroller,
more powerful than a mini-van.

615
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,552
I told you he was funny.

616
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:25,837
He's adorable.

617
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:30,096
Hey, Jim. Do you wanna
introduce me to your friends?

618
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:31,259
No.

619
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:35,017
Girls, this is Stifler.

620
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:37,940
So, how do you know
my best friend Jim?

621
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:39,817
Jim used to be my babysitter.

622
00:33:41,645 --> 00:33:43,693
Hey, I was just
gonna do a birthday shot.

623
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:45,115
Do you guys
wanna do one with me?

624
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,316
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

625
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:47,400
Yeah. Oh, ye& yes, yes.

626
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:49,369
I shouldn't.
Yes, we should, yes, we should.

627
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:53,824
Never have I ever
had sex in public.

628
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,998
Really? None of you?

629
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:03,792
Oh, come on, Heather.
You haven't drank once.

630
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:05,506
You are such a prude!

631
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:09,424
Or maybe I've just
never had sex in public.

632
00:34:10,257 --> 00:34:15,764
Okay, never have I
ever been in an orgy.

633
00:34:21,351 --> 00:34:23,274
They were really nice guys.

634
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:27,153
Believe it or not, this is
my first high school party.

635
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:28,783
You didn't miss much.

636
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:33,493
I always preferred staying at
home, throwing on a little NPR.

637
00:34:33,655 --> 00:34:35,498
You were so much
cooler than me.

638
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:39,579
I sat around writing
<i>X-Files</i> fan fiction.

639
00:34:42,122 --> 00:34:47,344
I translated The Brothers
Karamazov into Latin for fun.

640
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:51,173
That is so sexy.

641
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:53,679
You know it is.

642
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,518
I've only been
working as an architect

643
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:58,017
for the last few years,
and from home.

644
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:00,056
You've been with the same
company for over ten years.

645
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,476
That's awesome, it sounds like
everything is working out for you.

646
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:05,941
Yeah. I mean, everything's
good, especially work-wise.

647
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:07,523
But now that we're
back here in the town,

648
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:09,149
and we see, like,
all of our old friends,

649
00:35:09,316 --> 00:35:11,865
and everyone's married
and having kids,

650
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:14,951
it just makes me,
you know, think.

651
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:18,537
You okay there, Kev?

652
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:22,208
Yeah, I just don't
normally drink like this.

653
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,418
You're telling me you haven't
gotten a little bit tipsy

654
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:25,919
on Myers Family Wine Night?

655
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:29,131
I see somebody's been
stalking my Facebook page.

656
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:31,672
At least I don't take
pictures of my meals.

657
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:33,306
Who's stalking who now?

658
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:36,810
Okay, so I've been by your
page maybe once or twice.

659
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:40,222
You were dating someone
named Alessandro?

660
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:44,059
You know, he does know that he can take
a picture with his shirt on, right?

661
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:47,320
Alessandro is long gone.

662
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:50,990
It's over, huh?

663
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:57,238
Okay, after this drink,
I have to go home.

664
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:58,372
Jim.

665
00:35:58,448 --> 00:36:02,294
There's a smoking hot 18-year-old girl
over there that you used to babysit.

666
00:36:02,452 --> 00:36:04,420
And you're not going to
do anything about that?

667
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:06,673
Need I remind you that
I am married to Michelle?

668
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:07,749
Exactly.

669
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:13,631
Dude, these young chicks, they know
some crazy shit in the bedroom.

670
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:17,013
You could take what
you learn from Kara,

671
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,769
bring it home,
and apply it to Michelle.

672
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:23,098
You do care about your
marriage, don't you, Jim?

673
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:24,766
What are you talking
about, Stifler?

674
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:27,022
I'm not gonna cheat on my wife!

675
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,187
I'm a father
for Christ's sakes.

676
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:31,356
Yeah, that's perfect.

677
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:34,151
Yeah, chicks love a father figure.
Keep playing that card, dude.

678
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,490
It's not a card,
it's the truth.

679
00:36:36,653 --> 00:36:38,030
Hey. Hi.

680
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:39,456
What are you guys
talking about?

681
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:41,784
Oh, you know... Just“

682
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:45,375
Jim was just saying how much
fun he had taking care of you.

683
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:48,165
Hey, ladies, why don't we give
them some time to catch up?

684
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:49,420
Mmm-hmm. Yeah, after you.

685
00:36:49,499 --> 00:36:51,797
No, that's not necessary.
We should all hang out together.

686
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,553
Why don't we all...
Stifler, just...

687
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:55,050
Be her daddy.

688
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,137
Stifler? Stifler!

689
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:05,141
So, sounds like you and Mia have
quite an adventurous lifestyle.

690
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:07,726
Sometimes a little
too adventurous.

691
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:12,398
Wow. Well, Heather's a bit
more on the conservative side.

692
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,481
But, uh...

693
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:14,987
Hey! Hi.

694
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:20,663
But, I gotta be honest, Chris, I
could use a little adventure myself.

695
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:22,703
What are you getting at, Ron?

696
00:37:22,866 --> 00:37:27,588
I'm just saying that usually
I'm not one for swapping,

697
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:33,003
but the fact that you've been with
Heather already, kind of makes it okay.

698
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:36,588
So, what do you think?

699
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:38,923
Think they'd be into it?

700
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:42,723
I'm kidding.
Come on, I'm kidding!

701
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:46,188
Seriously,
I would never do that!

702
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:48,937
Unless you guys wanted to.

703
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:52,854
So you've really been to every
country in South America?

704
00:37:53,021 --> 00:37:54,944
No, no, not all of them.

705
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:58,201
And I don't consider
French Guiana a nation.

706
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:03,202
I remember, I couldn't
wait till graduation

707
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:06,288
so I could leave this town
and reinvent myself.

708
00:38:06,576 --> 00:38:09,170
You have certainly
reinvented yourself.

709
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:10,337
I don't know.

710
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:12,632
There's just a part of me
that still wishes that

711
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:15,130
I could just explore
the world, you know?

712
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,136
Be everything I set out to be.

713
00:38:17,587 --> 00:38:21,308
You can be whoever you wanna be.
You just gotta be it.

714
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:25,304
You wanna make out? Yeah.

715
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:32,985
Are you crazy?
I love the Twilight books.

716
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,896
New Moon is my favorite.

717
00:38:35,063 --> 00:38:36,064
Mine, too!

718
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:38,775
Oh, my God!
We have, like, so much in common!

719
00:38:38,942 --> 00:38:40,159
I know! I know!

720
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:43,575
Wanna hit this?

721
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,411
In more ways than one.

722
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:57,464
I don't know who this is, but
I'm pretty fucking busy right now.

723
00:38:57,627 --> 00:38:58,844
So sorry to interrupt, Stafler.

724
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:01,131
Didn't realize the Special
Olympics competed at night.

725
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:02,298
Oh, fuck.

726
00:39:04,384 --> 00:39:05,351
What the hell's
going on over there?

727
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:06,848
What, are you choking
on your own dick?

728
00:39:07,804 --> 00:39:10,853
Nothing, Mr. Duraiswamy,
nothing.

729
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:12,684
What can I do for you, sir?

730
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:14,694
Bob from Acquisitions
had a heart attack.

731
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,521
Some idiot told him
that he was fired.

732
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:17,905
<i>He flipped out, I don't know.</i>

733
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:20,408
Listen, I need someone
to finish his presentation.

734
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:23,320
I need you to go in on Sunday
and get everything ready. Yes?

735
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:25,784
Oh, wait, Sunday.

736
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:27,870
I got my high school reunion.

737
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,158
Oh, wow, how fun!

738
00:39:29,242 --> 00:39:30,664
Yeah, no, I'll just
call the chairman,

739
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:31,835
and I'll get him to reschedule.

740
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:34,248
Seriously?
Hey, that would be awesome!

741
00:39:34,414 --> 00:39:37,793
That was a fucking joke, you moron.
Jesus Christ, what am I doing?

742
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:40,757
You know what, I am gonna
handle this myself.

743
00:39:40,837 --> 00:39:43,716
No. No, no, no,
listen, Mr. Duraiswamy,

744
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:46,601
I can do it, okay?
I promise, I'll get it done.

745
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:48,303
Just don't fuck up, Stafler.

746
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,935
It's Stifler.

747
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:53,065
Dick! Hey, ladies...

748
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:55,602
Ladies? They bailed, dude.

749
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:57,486
Aw, fuck!

750
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:00,648
Ugh! Um...

751
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:02,484
Ooh!

752
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:05,992
Hey, Kara, how are you
getting home tonight?

753
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:08,832
AJ was supposed to
drive my car back,

754
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:10,333
but he hasn't
even shown up yet.

755
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:12,835
Some lame excuse
about his jet skis.

756
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:14,667
Can you believe that jerk?

757
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:18,333
What about you?

758
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:19,671
Will you take me?

759
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:22,053
Uh... Um...

760
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:25,674
Come on! We're going
to the same place.

761
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,763
Besides, it wouldn't
be responsible

762
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:30,186
to let me drive
in this condition.

763
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:31,600
Right?

764
00:40:38,895 --> 00:40:40,238
Okay, Kara.

765
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:44,234
Hey! Whoa! Careful!
Careful. Yeah.

766
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:46,077
Oh, my God, I love this song.

767
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:47,282
It's a good one.

768
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:48,909
Isn't classic rock the best?

769
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:52,372
Classic rock?
This is classic rock now?

770
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:56,421
Hey, you know, Kara, you
should drink some more water.

771
00:40:56,496 --> 00:40:58,043
Where's that bottle I gave you?

772
00:40:58,206 --> 00:41:00,129
Oh, it's right here. Okay.

773
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,385
In the back.

774
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:11,390
Shit. Sorry. Sorry.
There was a...

775
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:15,474
There was a little baby
squirrel in the road, so...

776
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:20,111
Whoa! Hey! Whoa!
That's not water. Okay.

777
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:23,614
It's a little too much now.

778
00:41:23,773 --> 00:41:27,573
I love how, after all these years,
you're still taking care of me.

779
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:30,705
Well, you know, a
babysitter's job never ends.

780
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:34,000
You knew I always
had a crush on you, right?

781
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,253
No.

782
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:40,540
I want you to be my first.

783
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:44,260
Your first?

784
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:46,421
Oh, God. Okay. Um...

785
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:48,635
Kara, listen. Um...

786
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:54,145
A person's virginity is
something sacred, you know?

787
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:55,805
You should save yourself
for someone special.

788
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:56,935
You're special.

789
00:41:57,015 --> 00:42:00,485
No! Not special.

790
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:02,771
You think? I really...

791
00:42:03,146 --> 00:42:04,773
What are you doing?

792
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:06,031
Hey, what are you doing?

793
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,693
Come on. No one
will ever find out.

794
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:12,117
I don't know. I don't think...

795
00:42:12,142 --> 00:42:15,069
No, I don't.
I don't think that's um.

796
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:17,458
I don't think I should do that.

797
00:42:17,459 --> 00:42:20,722
No I-I can't, I won't
so, you know that's

798
00:42:20,723 --> 00:42:22,121
Whoa. Hello. Okay.

799
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:25,663
Kara! Kara! That's kissing.
Kara you need to stop

800
00:42:25,664 --> 00:42:26,548
Stop!

801
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,657
You don't think I'm pretty?

802
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:34,541
Huh? Oh, no! You're very pretty, Kara.
You're very, very...

803
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:36,371
Really? Yes, very pretty.

804
00:42:36,455 --> 00:42:37,877
But I... Very pretty. Thanks.

805
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,462
Oh, my God!

806
00:42:39,624 --> 00:42:42,878
Holy shit! What?

807
00:42:44,212 --> 00:42:45,213
Oh, my... Where did your...

808
00:42:45,297 --> 00:42:46,298
Come on.

809
00:42:46,465 --> 00:42:48,809
I can't think of
a better birthday gift.

810
00:42:48,967 --> 00:42:50,514
What about the new iPhone?

811
00:42:50,594 --> 00:42:52,562
Huh? Maybe a little pendant?
The new Nicki Minaj album?

812
00:42:52,637 --> 00:42:54,731
No. No? Boobies.

813
00:42:54,848 --> 00:42:56,145
I want you! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

814
00:42:56,224 --> 00:42:57,476
You can't... Don't do that.

815
00:42:57,559 --> 00:42:59,061
That's not good, don't...

816
00:42:59,144 --> 00:43:00,646
Come on, stop

817
00:43:00,812 --> 00:43:02,689
Kara! Kara! Stop it.

818
00:43:03,315 --> 00:43:04,441
Shit!

819
00:43:06,485 --> 00:43:07,828
Whoa!

820
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:09,992
Shit. Kara?

821
00:43:10,655 --> 00:43:12,157
Holy Jesus! Kara?

822
00:43:12,324 --> 00:43:14,702
Kara! Kara!
Please wake up, Kara!

823
00:43:14,868 --> 00:43:16,541
Kara, wake up. Kara!

824
00:43:16,703 --> 00:43:17,704
Are you okay?

825
00:43:17,829 --> 00:43:18,921
Oh, Jesus, God!

826
00:43:18,997 --> 00:43:20,419
Oh, my God, are you all right?

827
00:43:21,041 --> 00:43:22,668
Hey, hi.

828
00:43:23,752 --> 00:43:25,846
Jim? Hey!

829
00:43:26,004 --> 00:43:28,553
What? This is crazy!

830
00:43:28,757 --> 00:43:30,134
Are you all right?

831
00:43:30,217 --> 00:43:33,687
Huh? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm okay. I was just... Um...

832
00:43:33,845 --> 00:43:36,223
I was reaching for something.

833
00:43:36,389 --> 00:43:38,562
Everything's okay.
Everything's fine.

834
00:43:39,101 --> 00:43:40,444
I don't know if you've heard.
Mmm?

835
00:43:40,519 --> 00:43:41,520
Did you hear?

836
00:43:42,187 --> 00:43:44,781
I am in charge of the reunion.

837
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:47,739
Oh! Yeah, no, that's...
Yeah, that's right.

838
00:43:47,901 --> 00:43:49,369
Got a whole '90s theme planned.

839
00:43:49,528 --> 00:43:51,280
Oh. That's...

840
00:43:51,446 --> 00:43:53,244
I booked Chumbawamba.

841
00:43:53,323 --> 00:43:55,371
Yeah. But the pricks
cancelled yesterday.

842
00:43:55,575 --> 00:43:58,374
Was a setback, but you know me,

843
00:43:58,578 --> 00:44:01,957
"I get knocked down but I
get up again."

844
00:44:04,918 --> 00:44:06,920
Oh, my God!
Okay, I see what's going on.

845
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:14,682
Yep.

846
00:44:14,761 --> 00:44:15,887
I'll see you later, buddy.

847
00:44:16,054 --> 00:44:17,727
All right then, I'll see you.

848
00:44:20,225 --> 00:44:22,728
Jesus, God. Kara.
Kara, wake up.

849
00:44:22,894 --> 00:44:24,896
I just need a nap. What?

850
00:44:25,063 --> 00:44:27,157
Kara, this isn't time
for a nap. Kara, wake up.

851
00:44:27,315 --> 00:44:28,612
This isn't napping time.

852
00:44:29,067 --> 00:44:31,411
Kara? Shit.

853
00:44:36,491 --> 00:44:40,337
Oh, God, this is bad.
This is very, very bad.

854
00:44:51,798 --> 00:44:53,141
What took you guys so long?

855
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:55,348
We were looking for Kevin.
Couldn't find him.

856
00:44:55,510 --> 00:44:58,980
Plus, that hot piece of ass Oz is banging
got wasted, so we had to drop her off.

857
00:44:59,139 --> 00:45:00,140
You brought him?

858
00:45:00,223 --> 00:45:01,395
Of course they brought me.

859
00:45:01,516 --> 00:45:03,063
When you guys were busy
jacking off in high school,

860
00:45:03,143 --> 00:45:05,111
I was running this
drill every weekend.

861
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:07,193
Now, let's see what
we are dealing with.

862
00:45:09,774 --> 00:45:10,775
Oh!

863
00:45:11,109 --> 00:45:13,111
Holy shit!

864
00:45:13,278 --> 00:45:14,245
Way to go, Jim.

865
00:45:14,321 --> 00:45:17,495
Shh. Okay, nothing happened, Stifler. Okay?
Nothing happened.

866
00:45:17,657 --> 00:45:18,658
Stop that!

867
00:45:18,867 --> 00:45:19,914
I'm sorry.

868
00:45:19,993 --> 00:45:21,415
So, Jim, what do you wanna do?

869
00:45:21,494 --> 00:45:22,746
I don't know.

870
00:45:22,829 --> 00:45:24,627
I can't just leave her
here naked, you know?

871
00:45:24,789 --> 00:45:27,463
I mean, if the cops come by
and find out I'm involved,

872
00:45:28,293 --> 00:45:29,465
I'm screwed.

873
00:45:29,628 --> 00:45:31,505
That leaves us
with two options.

874
00:45:32,464 --> 00:45:34,137
We dump the body or
we sneak her inside.

875
00:45:34,299 --> 00:45:36,301
Dump the body?
This isn't a mob hit.

876
00:45:36,468 --> 00:45:37,685
Okay, wait a second.

877
00:45:37,844 --> 00:45:41,189
I have been in her house
a million times to babysit.

878
00:45:41,348 --> 00:45:44,397
I can totally sneak her in
through the back door.

879
00:45:44,559 --> 00:45:47,153
I need you guys to
distract her parents.

880
00:45:47,312 --> 00:45:49,030
Do you think you can do that?

881
00:45:49,397 --> 00:45:53,493
I'm an expert, Jim.
Trust me. I got this shit.

882
00:46:00,992 --> 00:46:02,539
Good evening, sir.

883
00:46:02,702 --> 00:46:04,545
My friend's car broke down,

884
00:46:04,704 --> 00:46:08,174
and we were just wondering if we
could use your phone to call AAA.

885
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,379
You mean to tell me that none
of you have cell phones?

886
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:23,394
<i>Oh, my God, I know you.
You were on Celebrity Dance Off.</i>

887
00:46:23,556 --> 00:46:25,479
Oh, yeah!

888
00:46:25,558 --> 00:46:26,684
Ostreicher.

889
00:46:26,851 --> 00:46:28,068
Oh, yeah.

890
00:46:28,228 --> 00:46:29,354
Hey, come on in.

891
00:46:31,189 --> 00:46:32,782
That was very smooth, Stifler.

892
00:46:32,941 --> 00:46:34,193
Shut up, shitbreak.

893
00:46:34,359 --> 00:46:36,532
The last time I did this,
cell phones didn't exist.

894
00:46:52,085 --> 00:46:53,211
Shit!

895
00:46:59,217 --> 00:47:00,434
Daddy.

896
00:47:02,095 --> 00:47:03,142
Look, Mom, Daddy!

897
00:47:03,221 --> 00:47:04,222
Shit!

898
00:47:18,987 --> 00:47:20,739
Oh, fuck!

899
00:47:21,823 --> 00:47:23,416
Kara?

900
00:47:24,576 --> 00:47:25,577
Kara?

901
00:47:27,537 --> 00:47:28,584
Kara?

902
00:47:28,747 --> 00:47:30,966
Gonna have to find me.

903
00:47:31,041 --> 00:47:32,213
Kara?

904
00:47:33,376 --> 00:47:35,378
Thank you, Sheranda.
You've been very helpful.

905
00:47:35,462 --> 00:47:37,885
You get a Triple
A-plus in my book.

906
00:47:38,048 --> 00:47:41,097
Oh, you take care, too.
Okay, yeah, bye-bye.

907
00:47:42,093 --> 00:47:46,473
So, that was AAA on the phone and
they should be here in a jiffy.

908
00:47:47,390 --> 00:47:49,108
Does this song sound familiar?

909
00:47:54,397 --> 00:47:57,071
You were such a good dancer.
I felt so bad when you got voted off.

910
00:47:57,275 --> 00:47:58,322
Thank you.

911
00:47:58,485 --> 00:48:00,487
But I have to say you're
much sexier in person.

912
00:48:00,695 --> 00:48:04,666
Okay. Calm down there, Susan.

913
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:08,078
Dude, she wants to fuck
you big time, dude.

914
00:48:08,244 --> 00:48:10,417
You got to hit that.
No fucking way.

915
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:11,832
Do it for Jim, dude,
don't be selfish.

916
00:48:12,290 --> 00:48:15,134
Hey, you know what?
I think I have to go to the bathroom.

917
00:48:16,002 --> 00:48:18,096
Kara, this is not funny.

918
00:48:18,296 --> 00:48:20,970
Kara, come on! Kara, come out.

919
00:48:21,132 --> 00:48:22,349
Boo!

920
00:48:22,509 --> 00:48:23,806
Oh, my God!

921
00:48:23,831 --> 00:48:25,287
Okay. Right. Here

922
00:48:25,288 --> 00:48:26,384
Come on.

923
00:48:26,385 --> 00:48:27,500
Alright. Okay.

924
00:48:27,501 --> 00:48:28,298
Good. Okay.

925
00:48:28,299 --> 00:48:29,746
Alright. Come on.

926
00:48:29,747 --> 00:48:30,767
Okay, good.

927
00:48:31,207 --> 00:48:32,880
- Watch it
- You never could find me.

928
00:48:33,042 --> 00:48:35,761
Jim, I don't mean to alarm you
but you don't have much time.

929
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:36,921
Yes, I know.

930
00:48:37,088 --> 00:48:38,431
I like your scarf. Okay.

931
00:48:38,589 --> 00:48:40,262
I like your breasts Door.

932
00:48:40,425 --> 00:48:41,893
Would it be okay
if I get a picture?

933
00:48:42,051 --> 00:48:43,052
Sure.

934
00:48:47,557 --> 00:48:49,150
I know it's in here somewhere.

935
00:48:53,271 --> 00:48:55,239
Okay, a bottle of hair spray...

936
00:48:55,314 --> 00:48:56,361
You guys all right?

937
00:48:56,441 --> 00:48:57,784
Yeah. Yeah.

938
00:48:58,568 --> 00:48:59,615
You know something?

939
00:48:59,819 --> 00:49:04,620
I really was admiring how clean
your toilet was in your bathroom.

940
00:49:05,158 --> 00:49:06,284
Thanks.

941
00:49:06,951 --> 00:49:09,124
You know what?
I have to use the restroom, too.

942
00:49:09,287 --> 00:49:10,413
No, you don't.

943
00:49:18,004 --> 00:49:19,130
Let's get in bed.

944
00:49:19,297 --> 00:49:20,344
Come on and get in bed with me?

945
00:49:20,423 --> 00:49:21,549
No, I'm not getting in bed...

946
00:49:21,632 --> 00:49:22,679
Come on. Get in bed with me.

947
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,053
No, I'm not... Kara, please.
Oh, God. Please.

948
00:49:25,136 --> 00:49:26,137
Oh, shit!

949
00:49:27,305 --> 00:49:28,602
Stifler, what are
you doing here?

950
00:49:28,765 --> 00:49:30,608
I just wanted another glimpse.
No.

951
00:49:30,767 --> 00:49:32,189
Why'd you put her clothes
back on, dude? Boo.

952
00:49:32,268 --> 00:49:33,485
You have to go.

953
00:49:35,146 --> 00:49:36,363
What was that?

954
00:49:36,481 --> 00:49:38,700
That sounded like
it came from outside.

955
00:49:38,858 --> 00:49:40,701
No, that came from Kara's room.

956
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:41,952
Oh, Jesus.

957
00:49:42,028 --> 00:49:43,029
Kara?

958
00:49:45,073 --> 00:49:46,074
Oh, my God.

959
00:49:47,825 --> 00:49:49,042
Go, go, go!

960
00:49:56,334 --> 00:49:57,711
What the hell's
going on in here?

961
00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:00,967
Hi, Daddy.

962
00:50:01,714 --> 00:50:02,761
How'd you get back in?

963
00:50:03,841 --> 00:50:05,013
I don't remember.

964
00:50:05,176 --> 00:50:06,644
You don't remember?

965
00:50:07,512 --> 00:50:08,559
What was that sound?

966
00:50:08,638 --> 00:50:09,605
I don't know.

967
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:10,772
What do you mean,
you don't know?

968
00:50:10,848 --> 00:50:11,849
I don't know.

969
00:50:13,851 --> 00:50:15,194
You've been drinking,
haven't you?

970
00:50:15,353 --> 00:50:16,479
No.

971
00:50:16,646 --> 00:50:19,445
Kara, I told you these boys
try to get you drunk

972
00:50:19,524 --> 00:50:21,151
so they can take
advantage of you.

973
00:50:21,234 --> 00:50:22,827
I'm old enough
to know that, Dad.

974
00:50:22,985 --> 00:50:24,578
Yeah, well, I don't
want to go to jail

975
00:50:24,654 --> 00:50:26,577
for kicking some
horny kid's teeth in

976
00:50:26,656 --> 00:50:28,408
but I will, believe me.

977
00:50:32,078 --> 00:50:33,204
What is that?

978
00:50:33,371 --> 00:50:36,671
Oh, that's Mr. Moo!

979
00:50:37,416 --> 00:50:40,215
Will you get him for me,
Daddy? Please.

980
00:50:57,436 --> 00:50:59,564
I can't be mad at my angel.

981
00:51:05,570 --> 00:51:07,743
Happy birthday, princess.

982
00:51:07,947 --> 00:51:09,039
Thanks, Dad.

983
00:51:18,541 --> 00:51:19,633
What are you doing?

984
00:51:20,418 --> 00:51:21,761
Nothing.

985
00:51:25,339 --> 00:51:26,636
Oh, jeez.

986
00:51:28,885 --> 00:51:29,932
Stifler?

987
00:51:31,095 --> 00:51:32,187
Stifler?

988
00:51:32,263 --> 00:51:33,310
Up here, dude.

989
00:51:34,765 --> 00:51:36,108
I told you I was an expert.

990
00:51:37,268 --> 00:51:38,485
Oh, shit.

991
00:51:39,145 --> 00:51:40,772
What the hell is going on now?

992
00:51:43,691 --> 00:51:44,863
Hey.

993
00:51:44,942 --> 00:51:46,819
Want to go to
a Justin Bieber concert?

994
00:51:46,903 --> 00:51:48,325
Uh... Jim?

995
00:51:48,613 --> 00:51:49,990
Stifler, come on. Come on!

996
00:51:50,156 --> 00:51:51,453
Let's go.

997
00:51:52,575 --> 00:51:55,328
You and you, stay here.

998
00:51:55,828 --> 00:51:57,045
Don't push me.

999
00:51:58,331 --> 00:51:59,799
Whoa! Oh, my God.

1000
00:52:02,793 --> 00:52:03,840
Ah!

1001
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,263
Kara, where
the hell are you?

1002
00:52:05,338 --> 00:52:07,136
I'm on my way to
your place and...

1003
00:52:10,468 --> 00:52:11,845
What the...

1004
00:52:11,928 --> 00:52:12,975
Fuck!

1005
00:52:18,309 --> 00:52:20,107
What the hell is going on?

1006
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:22,647
Oh, God!

1007
00:52:34,784 --> 00:52:37,162
Hey, stud.

1008
00:52:37,328 --> 00:52:39,171
I thought you'd never...

1009
00:53:00,268 --> 00:53:04,444
Oh, shit, shit.
We were supposed to...

1010
00:53:04,563 --> 00:53:05,610
No, it's fine.

1011
00:53:05,690 --> 00:53:07,692
What? No, God, it's not fine.

1012
00:53:08,734 --> 00:53:11,738
Shoot! I'm so sorry, Michelle.
I really... I wanted to, I just...

1013
00:53:11,904 --> 00:53:13,952
I'm going to drop
Ev at my grandma's

1014
00:53:14,031 --> 00:53:16,033
and I'll be back
this afternoon.

1015
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:18,168
No, Michelle, hold on.

1016
00:53:22,039 --> 00:53:23,507
Jim, I'm worried.

1017
00:53:24,583 --> 00:53:26,176
What are you worried about?

1018
00:53:26,335 --> 00:53:30,181
Just we're like so out of sync.

1019
00:53:32,258 --> 00:53:33,885
I just...

1020
00:53:34,051 --> 00:53:36,554
I don't know how much longer
we can go on like this.

1021
00:53:39,056 --> 00:53:43,277
I promise you I will do everything
I can to make it up to you.

1022
00:53:43,602 --> 00:53:44,899
Okay?

1023
00:53:45,062 --> 00:53:46,689
Stifler's having
a party tonight.

1024
00:53:47,857 --> 00:53:52,328
Okay, I know that doesn't
sound romantic or anything,

1025
00:53:52,403 --> 00:53:57,910
but remember our first time
was at a Stifler party.

1026
00:53:58,075 --> 00:53:59,622
You made me your bitch.

1027
00:54:02,246 --> 00:54:04,624
Yes. Yes, I did.

1028
00:54:24,143 --> 00:54:25,645
Tell me when, okay?

1029
00:54:25,978 --> 00:54:27,230
What the fuck?

1030
00:54:36,614 --> 00:54:37,957
Mmm.

1031
00:54:54,799 --> 00:54:57,097
So, Mia.

1032
00:54:58,094 --> 00:55:01,143
She's a free spirit.

1033
00:55:01,305 --> 00:55:02,807
She's something else.

1034
00:55:02,973 --> 00:55:04,475
Yeah, she is.

1035
00:55:06,519 --> 00:55:09,318
Wait a minute, do I sense
a little jealousy there?

1036
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:10,982
No. Mmm-mmm. No?

1037
00:55:11,148 --> 00:55:13,401
Hey, don't forget, you were
the one who broke up with me

1038
00:55:13,484 --> 00:55:14,781
before you went to med school.

1039
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:19,036
Hey, you were moving to LA
with no return in sight.

1040
00:55:19,198 --> 00:55:21,667
You can't blame me for
wanting to settle down.

1041
00:55:21,992 --> 00:55:24,165
No, I don't.

1042
00:55:24,995 --> 00:55:27,748
I just don't
want you to settle.

1043
00:55:28,374 --> 00:55:30,547
Look who's jealous now.

1044
00:55:30,709 --> 00:55:33,508
I wouldn't call being
with Ron "settling."

1045
00:55:33,671 --> 00:55:36,174
Oh, no, he's gorgeous on paper.

1046
00:55:36,549 --> 00:55:37,971
What is that supposed to mean?

1047
00:55:38,342 --> 00:55:40,060
Nothing. Um...

1048
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:44,315
I'm sorry. You're right.

1049
00:55:46,016 --> 00:55:47,689
I am a bit jealous.

1050
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:50,863
You know, it's funny.

1051
00:55:51,814 --> 00:55:55,364
In some ways, you've
completely changed,

1052
00:55:55,526 --> 00:55:58,496
and, in other ways,
you're exactly the same.

1053
00:55:58,654 --> 00:56:00,702
Heather, you can believe this,

1054
00:56:00,865 --> 00:56:02,367
nothing's changed.

1055
00:56:04,827 --> 00:56:05,874
Oh, my God.

1056
00:56:06,036 --> 00:56:07,663
Chris Ostreicher?

1057
00:56:08,205 --> 00:56:09,377
Hi, girls.

1058
00:56:09,457 --> 00:56:10,583
Can I get a pic?

1059
00:56:10,749 --> 00:56:11,841
Sure.

1060
00:56:17,506 --> 00:56:18,553
Dad?

1061
00:56:20,259 --> 00:56:21,556
Oh, hey, Dad. Hey, Jim.

1062
00:56:21,719 --> 00:56:23,346
I'm just going to
run out for a sec.

1063
00:56:23,512 --> 00:56:26,356
I was just watching
your old Bar Mitzvah tape.

1064
00:56:28,225 --> 00:56:29,772
<i>I got
your Jew scarf!</i>

1065
00:56:29,935 --> 00:56:31,562
<i>Give it back, Stifler.</i>

1066
00:56:34,356 --> 00:56:39,783
<i>I think I'm the happiest man
in the world thanks to you.</i>

1067
00:56:45,367 --> 00:56:47,290
Yeah, I miss her too, Dad.

1068
00:56:49,288 --> 00:56:50,460
I know.

1069
00:56:58,797 --> 00:57:02,768
Dad, you've always been
there to give me advice.

1070
00:57:03,093 --> 00:57:06,768
But if there's anything
that you want to talk about,

1071
00:57:08,098 --> 00:57:09,600
I'm here for you.

1072
00:57:11,143 --> 00:57:13,612
Yeah, I don't think
there's anything

1073
00:57:13,687 --> 00:57:16,110
I really need
to talk about, Jim.

1074
00:57:17,066 --> 00:57:20,115
Do you think maybe
it's time for you to

1075
00:57:20,569 --> 00:57:21,946
meet someone else?

1076
00:57:23,113 --> 00:57:25,161
Dad, it's okay.

1077
00:57:25,324 --> 00:57:29,454
What you're going through
is perfectly natural.

1078
00:57:30,371 --> 00:57:33,170
You know, there are
services out there...

1079
00:57:33,332 --> 00:57:34,379
Services? Yeah.

1080
00:57:34,458 --> 00:57:35,675
Like what?

1081
00:57:35,834 --> 00:57:37,632
A happy ending? What's that?

1082
00:57:37,795 --> 00:57:38,842
Because I won't go there.

1083
00:57:38,921 --> 00:57:39,922
Oh, my God.

1084
00:57:40,047 --> 00:57:42,049
I don't need that...
I don't need that kind of massage, Jim.

1085
00:57:42,132 --> 00:57:43,224
That's not what I was...

1086
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:44,893
Because, you know what,
it's dangerous.

1087
00:57:44,969 --> 00:57:46,437
And you can pick things up.

1088
00:57:46,512 --> 00:57:48,389
You don't even wanna know
what you can pick up.

1089
00:57:48,556 --> 00:57:50,058
Talk to your uncle Mort.
I'd rather not.

1090
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:51,357
He was in the hospital
for two weeks.

1091
00:57:51,433 --> 00:57:52,901
That's disgusting.

1092
00:57:56,146 --> 00:57:58,649
I was talking about

1093
00:57:59,358 --> 00:58:00,951
online dating services.

1094
00:58:02,653 --> 00:58:03,700
No, Jim.

1095
00:58:03,862 --> 00:58:06,911
Yeah, right, at my age?
I don't think so.

1096
00:58:07,074 --> 00:58:09,076
I've been out of
the game for so long.

1097
00:58:09,159 --> 00:58:10,661
There wasn't even
a game back then.

1098
00:58:10,744 --> 00:58:14,749
Dad, don't worry.
I'll hook you up.

1099
00:58:20,004 --> 00:58:21,301
Do you have those photos?

1100
00:58:21,672 --> 00:58:23,265
Here you go.

1101
00:58:23,591 --> 00:58:24,592
Wow.

1102
00:58:24,675 --> 00:58:25,847
Yeah. Oh.

1103
00:58:26,010 --> 00:58:27,262
We might need something
a little more recent.

1104
00:58:27,344 --> 00:58:28,345
Do you think?

1105
00:58:30,014 --> 00:58:33,109
Do you have something
that's a bit sexier?

1106
00:58:33,934 --> 00:58:35,151
Gotcha.

1107
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:40,232
Did you...

1108
00:58:40,858 --> 00:58:42,075
Favorite music.

1109
00:58:42,359 --> 00:58:43,360
Um...

1110
00:58:43,611 --> 00:58:44,988
Herman's Hermits.

1111
00:58:45,362 --> 00:58:46,363
Okay.

1112
00:58:47,197 --> 00:58:48,164
Oh...

1113
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:51,210
Girls, one at a time, please.

1114
00:58:51,535 --> 00:58:52,707
Interests and hobbies.

1115
00:58:52,870 --> 00:58:53,962
Sudoku.

1116
00:58:54,121 --> 00:58:55,213
We'll come back to this one.

1117
00:59:02,129 --> 00:59:04,131
Are we sure we're
not taking off too much?

1118
00:59:04,298 --> 00:59:07,017
These caterpillars are
kind of my trademark.

1119
00:59:08,886 --> 00:59:11,560
Okay... Perfect.

1120
00:59:11,722 --> 00:59:14,145
Take a look. I'm nervous.

1121
00:59:18,062 --> 00:59:21,066
Oh, that's fantastic!

1122
00:59:21,231 --> 00:59:24,235
That is a great look for me!

1123
00:59:24,485 --> 00:59:25,486
Huh?

1124
00:59:25,569 --> 00:59:29,199
Leaner lines.
I still have mobility.

1125
00:59:30,199 --> 00:59:32,167
Why didn't I do
this 30 years ago?

1126
00:59:32,242 --> 00:59:33,243
Looking good.

1127
00:59:33,410 --> 00:59:35,378
Why don't we test this
new look out tonight?

1128
00:59:35,704 --> 00:59:36,705
Oh, um...

1129
00:59:37,081 --> 00:59:40,460
The thing is, Stifler is
throwing a party tonight.

1130
00:59:40,751 --> 00:59:42,594
Oh! Well, another time.

1131
00:59:42,753 --> 00:59:44,972
But you could come with us.

1132
00:59:45,589 --> 00:59:46,886
It would be nice to
get out of the house.

1133
00:59:47,049 --> 00:59:48,596
I do have to warn you, though,

1134
00:59:48,759 --> 00:59:52,013
Stifler's parties
can get a little.

1135
00:59:52,179 --> 00:59:53,351
Wild.

1136
01:00:05,567 --> 01:00:08,946
What the fuck is this?

1137
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:11,782
Who the hell changed the music?

1138
01:00:11,949 --> 01:00:14,247
Sorry, we thought this
was more baby-friendly.

1139
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:17,209
Didn't we? Yes, we did.

1140
01:00:17,371 --> 01:00:19,089
Stifmeister!

1141
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:22,876
Ch!

1142
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:23,961
Bluck!

1143
01:00:24,378 --> 01:00:25,595
Chester!

1144
01:00:28,674 --> 01:00:30,392
What have you
cock-smokers been up to?

1145
01:00:30,551 --> 01:00:32,849
Well, we just got engaged.
Yeah.

1146
01:00:33,011 --> 01:00:35,514
What? That's so fucking gay.

1147
01:00:37,391 --> 01:00:39,644
Yeah, Stifler, we are gay.

1148
01:00:40,144 --> 01:00:41,566
Half the lacrosse team was gay.

1149
01:00:41,645 --> 01:00:43,773
You must have
known that, right?

1150
01:00:43,897 --> 01:00:46,446
Dude, you walked in on Doug
and Barry in the shower.

1151
01:00:47,776 --> 01:00:49,494
I just thought
they were wrestling.

1152
01:00:50,757 --> 01:00:53,683
- They were
- Yeah they definitely were

1153
01:00:53,684 --> 01:00:56,024
They just wasn't a
loser that night

1154
01:00:56,025 --> 01:00:56,609
Oh.

1155
01:01:02,105 --> 01:01:04,153
Are we sure this is Stifler's?

1156
01:01:04,775 --> 01:01:05,776
Ooh!

1157
01:01:05,859 --> 01:01:07,202
Hors d'oeuvres!

1158
01:01:07,319 --> 01:01:08,946
Why don't you give
this to our host, son?

1159
01:01:10,948 --> 01:01:11,949
Hmm.

1160
01:01:12,616 --> 01:01:14,960
Oh, my God! Look who it is.

1161
01:01:15,077 --> 01:01:16,169
Hey.

1162
01:01:18,288 --> 01:01:19,710
Sorry for interrupting
you guys last night.

1163
01:01:20,165 --> 01:01:22,042
Bravo, by the way.

1164
01:01:22,209 --> 01:01:24,962
Most wives stop doing that
after they get the ring.

1165
01:01:25,128 --> 01:01:26,971
What are you talking about?
Did you change your hair color?

1166
01:01:27,130 --> 01:01:32,478
So, is your buddy, the other
MILF guy, here tonight?

1167
01:01:32,636 --> 01:01:34,479
I thought you always come
to these things together.

1168
01:01:35,305 --> 01:01:39,310
Let's just say that friendship
is a two-way street.

1169
01:01:40,852 --> 01:01:42,354
Excuse me.

1170
01:01:44,523 --> 01:01:45,524
Mmm.

1171
01:01:45,816 --> 01:01:47,693
Could this party get any lamer?

1172
01:01:48,735 --> 01:01:50,328
It's not so bad.

1173
01:01:51,822 --> 01:01:53,495
You want some E?

1174
01:01:53,657 --> 01:01:55,375
No. Why do you have that?

1175
01:01:55,826 --> 01:01:58,204
No one else here
probably has any.

1176
01:01:58,370 --> 01:01:59,417
Are you sure you
don't want one?

1177
01:01:59,580 --> 01:02:00,581
Yeah.

1178
01:02:00,706 --> 01:02:01,878
No... Yes.

1179
01:02:01,957 --> 01:02:02,958
No.

1180
01:02:03,041 --> 01:02:05,214
Okay. Fine. More for me, then.

1181
01:02:10,716 --> 01:02:12,013
And there they are.

1182
01:02:12,175 --> 01:02:13,347
Finchy.

1183
01:02:14,386 --> 01:02:17,890
There you guys are. Look around.
Can you believe this shit?

1184
01:02:18,056 --> 01:02:19,854
Yeah, man. Nice work.

1185
01:02:20,017 --> 01:02:21,439
For you.

1186
01:02:21,518 --> 01:02:23,270
What the hell am I
supposed to do with this?

1187
01:02:23,437 --> 01:02:24,905
That's called wine, Stifler.

1188
01:02:25,063 --> 01:02:26,690
No, no, no, no,
not at my party.

1189
01:02:26,773 --> 01:02:28,070
I'm going to get us some shots.

1190
01:02:29,484 --> 01:02:30,531
Hey, Kev.

1191
01:02:30,611 --> 01:02:32,204
Can I talk to you
guys for a sec?

1192
01:02:32,529 --> 01:02:34,531
Yeah, sure. Wait here,
I'll be right back.

1193
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:38,247
So, you brought the goods?

1194
01:02:38,452 --> 01:02:39,704
Right here.

1195
01:02:39,870 --> 01:02:41,417
I want to see.

1196
01:02:43,874 --> 01:02:46,878
What the...
Where did those fuckers go?

1197
01:02:47,210 --> 01:02:48,211
Hello, Steven.

1198
01:02:48,754 --> 01:02:50,552
Mr. Levenstein. Yes.

1199
01:02:50,631 --> 01:02:51,723
You made it.

1200
01:02:51,882 --> 01:02:54,510
It is so great to see
all you kids back in town.

1201
01:02:54,593 --> 01:02:55,640
Hmm.

1202
01:02:55,719 --> 01:02:59,098
And what a terrific soiree
you're throwing here tonight.

1203
01:02:59,264 --> 01:03:01,107
Just wonderful!

1204
01:03:01,266 --> 01:03:04,941
You know what?
I'm going to get you fucked up.

1205
01:03:05,020 --> 01:03:06,317
Hmm? Have a shot.

1206
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:08,073
Oh! No, no, no.

1207
01:03:08,231 --> 01:03:11,610
I don't think so, Steven.
I'm not much of a drinker.

1208
01:03:11,777 --> 01:03:13,745
Drink it. Drink it!
Drink it! No, I can't.

1209
01:03:13,904 --> 01:03:15,326
Drink it! Drink it!

1210
01:03:17,407 --> 01:03:18,499
Awesome! Let's do another one.

1211
01:03:18,575 --> 01:03:19,747
I don't think so.

1212
01:03:19,826 --> 01:03:22,170
Look, Kev, you don't know for
sure if anything happened.

1213
01:03:22,245 --> 01:03:25,590
I woke up next to her in bed,
and all our clothes were off.

1214
01:03:25,749 --> 01:03:28,423
I mean, whatever happened,
I feel guilty.

1215
01:03:28,585 --> 01:03:30,258
Kevin, in France,

1216
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:34,095
it's only considered cheating if
your wife catches you in the act.

1217
01:03:37,469 --> 01:03:38,470
She's here.

1218
01:03:40,764 --> 01:03:42,186
I gotta go.

1219
01:03:42,474 --> 01:03:44,101
All right, get ready.

1220
01:03:44,267 --> 01:03:46,736
Wait for it. Wait for it!

1221
01:03:46,812 --> 01:03:47,859
Wait for it!

1222
01:03:47,938 --> 01:03:49,485
Here she comes!

1223
01:03:49,898 --> 01:03:50,945
Yeah!

1224
01:03:51,024 --> 01:03:52,776
Fuck yeah, Mr. Levenstein!

1225
01:03:52,943 --> 01:03:55,071
The name is Noah, motherfucker.

1226
01:03:58,281 --> 01:03:59,282
Mmm.

1227
01:03:59,449 --> 01:04:00,792
Feel the sofa.

1228
01:04:00,951 --> 01:04:03,625
It's so smooth.

1229
01:04:04,121 --> 01:04:06,965
It feels like a Smurf's ass.

1230
01:04:07,124 --> 01:04:08,467
Did you feel it?

1231
01:04:08,625 --> 01:04:11,674
Okay. Mia, can you...

1232
01:04:13,171 --> 01:04:15,139
Hey, guys. Sorry we're late.

1233
01:04:15,340 --> 01:04:16,341
Hi.

1234
01:04:17,384 --> 01:04:20,479
Hey, I got a treat for everybody.
I picked something up.

1235
01:04:20,637 --> 01:04:23,311
<i>Celebrity Dance Off, Season Six.
My man, Chris Ostreicher.</i>

1236
01:04:23,390 --> 01:04:24,391
Oh, my God.

1237
01:04:27,018 --> 01:04:29,020
We have to watch this.

1238
01:04:29,187 --> 01:04:31,861
Who wants to see my
baby shake his booty?

1239
01:04:33,483 --> 01:04:34,951
I know I do.

1240
01:04:35,110 --> 01:04:37,454
JDate? You have
to be kidding me.

1241
01:04:37,612 --> 01:04:40,866
If you want quality vag, you
have to go out into the wild.

1242
01:04:41,032 --> 01:04:42,284
"Vag"?

1243
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:45,003
What is that, a half a vagina?

1244
01:04:46,455 --> 01:04:49,334
You know, in my day
we called it a beaver.

1245
01:04:49,499 --> 01:04:53,345
And let me tell you something,
I snagged a pelt or two.

1246
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:54,550
I bet you did.

1247
01:04:54,671 --> 01:04:55,672
Dad?

1248
01:04:55,756 --> 01:04:58,179
Hey, Jim, your dad is so
much cooler than you.

1249
01:04:58,258 --> 01:04:59,931
Stifler, please stop
getting my dad drunk.

1250
01:05:00,010 --> 01:05:02,354
No, he's just trying
to get me some vag.

1251
01:05:02,429 --> 01:05:03,430
Okay, come on.

1252
01:05:03,513 --> 01:05:05,186
Yeah! Hey, hey.

1253
01:05:05,348 --> 01:05:07,021
Let the man make
his own decisions.

1254
01:05:07,184 --> 01:05:08,231
Stop. Come on.

1255
01:05:08,310 --> 01:05:09,311
Don't listen to him.

1256
01:05:09,978 --> 01:05:12,322
I want you to dust off
that old dick of yours,

1257
01:05:12,481 --> 01:05:14,483
go out there, and get some ass.

1258
01:05:14,649 --> 01:05:15,821
Oh! Just go out there.

1259
01:05:15,901 --> 01:05:17,027
I think I Will.

1260
01:05:17,194 --> 01:05:19,993
Dad, stop, okay?
It's exactly what I'm gonna...

1261
01:05:20,071 --> 01:05:22,745
I'm sorry, but you have had a
little too much to drink tonight,

1262
01:05:22,866 --> 01:05:24,118
and I'm not letting you...
No, no.

1263
01:05:24,201 --> 01:05:27,580
No, son, I haven't
hardly had one drink.

1264
01:05:27,746 --> 01:05:30,044
And you know I love you.

1265
01:05:30,207 --> 01:05:34,428
I do love you, but you need to

1266
01:05:35,837 --> 01:05:36,838
chillax.

1267
01:05:37,422 --> 01:05:39,516
"Chillax"?
Dad, where are you going?

1268
01:05:39,591 --> 01:05:41,059
Do you see him? Jim! Jim!

1269
01:05:41,218 --> 01:05:42,891
Let him go.
Let him have some fun.

1270
01:05:44,054 --> 01:05:47,729
And now we can have some fun.

1271
01:05:48,934 --> 01:05:49,935
Come on.

1272
01:05:51,728 --> 01:05:53,196
Excuse me.

1273
01:05:53,355 --> 01:05:55,232
I'm sorry, excuse me.

1274
01:05:55,398 --> 01:05:56,490
Is this a washroom?

1275
01:05:57,943 --> 01:05:59,991
It doesn't even occur to you
that you're self-centered

1276
01:06:00,070 --> 01:06:02,994
because you are so
self-centered and...

1277
01:06:03,073 --> 01:06:04,950
You know what?
Hold on a second.

1278
01:06:06,910 --> 01:06:08,036
Can I help you?

1279
01:06:09,579 --> 01:06:10,956
Who might you be?

1280
01:06:11,122 --> 01:06:12,749
I'm Stifler's mom.

1281
01:06:13,250 --> 01:06:14,251
Oh.

1282
01:06:14,793 --> 01:06:16,591
I'm Jim's dad.

1283
01:06:17,921 --> 01:06:19,423
Later, fucker.

1284
01:06:38,275 --> 01:06:41,404
Oh, my God, this is the most
ridiculous thing I've ever seen.

1285
01:06:48,869 --> 01:06:50,746
Dude, you have an amazing body!

1286
01:06:50,829 --> 01:06:55,300
<i>Everybody, raise the roof
for Chris Ostreicher!</i>

1287
01:06:55,375 --> 01:06:57,377
<i>You have really been
bringing it all season long.</i>

1288
01:06:57,460 --> 01:07:01,966
<i>But now it's time, Chris, to see if
America thinks you done brought it.</i>

1289
01:07:02,632 --> 01:07:04,054
<i>You ready? Let's do it.</i>

1290
01:07:04,134 --> 01:07:05,135
<i>Let's see the results.</i>

1291
01:07:11,266 --> 01:07:13,985
What?
Gilbert Gottfried and not you?

1292
01:07:14,144 --> 01:07:15,270
Fucking bullshit!

1293
01:07:15,437 --> 01:07:17,565
<i>Chris, I'm so sorry, man.</i>

1294
01:07:17,731 --> 01:07:22,328
<i>Well, we saw you jam.
Now, it's time to scram.</i>

1295
01:07:23,278 --> 01:07:24,575
<i>Do you have any last
thoughts for the audience?</i>

1296
01:07:24,738 --> 01:07:27,241
Okay, guys, we can
probably end it there.

1297
01:07:27,407 --> 01:07:29,660
What? No, are you kidding?
I haven't seen this.

1298
01:07:29,826 --> 01:07:32,170
<i>I think what I've
learned is to be true</i>

1299
01:07:32,245 --> 01:07:33,337
<i>to myself,</i>

1300
01:07:33,496 --> 01:07:36,500
<i>because that's what
dancing is, it's truth.</i>

1301
01:07:36,666 --> 01:07:38,760
<i>And maybe,</i>

1302
01:07:39,002 --> 01:07:42,176
<i>if we just danced
a little bit more,</i>

1303
01:07:42,339 --> 01:07:45,718
<i>there would be no more wars.</i>

1304
01:07:47,594 --> 01:07:49,016
<i>No more war!</i>

1305
01:07:49,095 --> 01:07:51,393
Well, that is a thoughtful
take on foreign policy.

1306
01:07:52,891 --> 01:07:55,394
<i>Stick around. Hulk Hogan gets
jiggy-friggy, right after this.</i>

1307
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:56,857
<i>You don't want to miss this.
Stick around.</i>

1308
01:08:05,737 --> 01:08:06,909
Hey.

1309
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:09,374
If you want my opinion,
I think you got cheated.

1310
01:08:11,451 --> 01:08:12,623
Are you okay?

1311
01:08:13,536 --> 01:08:15,209
You know,

1312
01:08:15,956 --> 01:08:18,960
when you lose something that's important
to you, it doesn't feel very good.

1313
01:08:19,584 --> 01:08:21,803
Oz, it's just a show.

1314
01:08:22,420 --> 01:08:24,969
I'm not talking about the show.

1315
01:08:32,180 --> 01:08:34,057
Hey, Heather,
you down there?

1316
01:08:34,683 --> 01:08:36,151
Um, coming!

1317
01:08:37,185 --> 01:08:38,562
Oh, my God.

1318
01:08:38,728 --> 01:08:40,025
Wait here, I'll be right back.

1319
01:08:41,690 --> 01:08:43,863
I can't tell you how many times
I walked into Steven's room

1320
01:08:44,025 --> 01:08:46,869
and I caught him in the
middle of sex with some girl.

1321
01:08:47,028 --> 01:08:49,827
At least he was with
a real, live human girl.

1322
01:08:49,990 --> 01:08:51,207
What are you talking about?

1323
01:08:51,282 --> 01:08:55,412
I walked into the kitchen once,
and I saw Jim humping a pie.

1324
01:08:57,497 --> 01:09:01,127
He turned the damn thing into a
crumble in about two seconds.

1325
01:09:05,839 --> 01:09:07,432
I can top that.

1326
01:09:07,590 --> 01:09:08,807
I once walked into my bedroom

1327
01:09:08,883 --> 01:09:12,262
and I caught Steven sticking
my hairbrush up his ass.

1328
01:09:16,016 --> 01:09:18,189
No, and it wasn't
the handle side, either.

1329
01:09:21,730 --> 01:09:22,731
Oh!

1330
01:09:24,107 --> 01:09:26,451
No, no, no.

1331
01:09:27,944 --> 01:09:32,370
A pretty lady like you shouldn't
be drinking quite so much.

1332
01:09:33,158 --> 01:09:34,501
And neither should I.

1333
01:09:41,124 --> 01:09:42,467
How about a joint, then?

1334
01:09:45,503 --> 01:09:49,633
We don't have to wait 13 years
to see each other again.

1335
01:09:49,799 --> 01:09:51,392
Yeah, true.

1336
01:09:51,551 --> 01:09:55,522
And I guess I could come along
on one of your adventures.

1337
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:58,559
Am I good sidekick material?

1338
01:09:58,641 --> 01:09:59,688
Sidekick?

1339
01:09:59,768 --> 01:10:04,740
I think you are a lot more
than sidekick material.

1340
01:10:10,487 --> 01:10:12,330
Is everything okay?

1341
01:10:14,991 --> 01:10:16,993
It's better than ever.

1342
01:10:19,829 --> 01:10:20,876
Mmm. Mmm.

1343
01:10:20,955 --> 01:10:22,298
Okay, wait, wait.

1344
01:10:22,457 --> 01:10:26,303
I don't think we're dressed
appropriately for the occasion.

1345
01:10:26,461 --> 01:10:28,008
Put that on.

1346
01:10:28,171 --> 01:10:29,514
Wait, where are you going?

1347
01:10:29,589 --> 01:10:32,513
To change. Be back soon.

1348
01:10:43,019 --> 01:10:44,236
Dudes!

1349
01:10:46,022 --> 01:10:47,615
What's up, bro?

1350
01:10:48,566 --> 01:10:50,534
Big Stiffy?

1351
01:10:50,693 --> 01:10:52,787
Blowjob Lipstein.

1352
01:10:55,740 --> 01:10:58,539
Oh, you have to be
fucking kidding me!

1353
01:10:58,743 --> 01:10:59,869
Excuse me?

1354
01:11:06,584 --> 01:11:07,631
Okay.

1355
01:11:08,253 --> 01:11:11,427
What the hell are you doing?
You just expect me to blow you?

1356
01:11:11,506 --> 01:11:12,553
Yeah!

1357
01:11:12,715 --> 01:11:14,092
I'm out of here.

1358
01:11:14,259 --> 01:11:15,761
Wait. Wait, Wait!

1359
01:11:15,927 --> 01:11:17,395
Look, I get it.

1360
01:11:17,554 --> 01:11:19,227
You're self-conscious
about your body.

1361
01:11:19,931 --> 01:11:22,775
Don't worry. I was going to
shut the lights off anyway.

1362
01:11:22,934 --> 01:11:25,562
You are the same douchebag
that you were in high school.

1363
01:11:26,062 --> 01:11:29,783
You just expect me to do
everything while I get nothing?

1364
01:11:29,941 --> 01:11:30,942
Later.

1365
01:11:31,025 --> 01:11:32,242
No, no!

1366
01:11:36,406 --> 01:11:38,283
Let's make a deal.

1367
01:11:39,576 --> 01:11:42,955
I'll get you off,
you get me off.

1368
01:11:43,121 --> 01:11:44,998
What do you say?

1369
01:11:45,331 --> 01:11:46,583
Fine.

1370
01:11:47,250 --> 01:11:49,093
But I am putting you to work.

1371
01:11:49,460 --> 01:11:50,837
Holy shit.

1372
01:11:52,005 --> 01:11:53,757
Chow time!

1373
01:11:57,177 --> 01:11:59,054
There you are!

1374
01:11:59,137 --> 01:12:01,936
I've been looking
all over for you.

1375
01:12:02,098 --> 01:12:04,692
Listen, we really need to...

1376
01:12:06,436 --> 01:12:07,938
What are you doing?

1377
01:12:08,104 --> 01:12:09,526
Taking what's mine.

1378
01:12:12,108 --> 01:12:14,782
No, I just wanted to hear
the sound of your voice.

1379
01:12:15,069 --> 01:12:17,618
Aw, is everything okay?
You seem stressed.

1380
01:12:18,031 --> 01:12:19,658
Stressed?

1381
01:12:21,492 --> 01:12:23,290
There you are!

1382
01:12:24,787 --> 01:12:26,835
No, no, no.

1383
01:12:26,998 --> 01:12:30,719
I have to go right now, but I'll
call you back in a little bit.

1384
01:12:30,877 --> 01:12:34,131
<i>Okay. And don't worry, I won't
watch Gossip Girl without you.</i>

1385
01:12:34,255 --> 01:12:35,222
<i>I miss you, babe.</i>

1386
01:12:35,298 --> 01:12:36,720
I miss you, too.

1387
01:12:40,136 --> 01:12:43,640
Listen, Vicky,
about last night,

1388
01:12:44,515 --> 01:12:45,812
that wasn't me.

1389
01:12:45,975 --> 01:12:48,069
With what happened...

1390
01:12:48,728 --> 01:12:51,322
I don't know.
It might be normal in your world.

1391
01:12:51,481 --> 01:12:53,233
What do you think happened?

1392
01:12:53,691 --> 01:12:56,035
Well, all our clothes
were on the floor.

1393
01:12:56,194 --> 01:12:57,491
Yeah, because
they were soaking wet

1394
01:12:57,570 --> 01:12:59,243
from when you got drunk
and fell in the lake.

1395
01:12:59,405 --> 01:13:00,907
I took care of you.

1396
01:13:01,074 --> 01:13:03,918
So, we didn't have sex?

1397
01:13:04,077 --> 01:13:05,203
Of course not.

1398
01:13:05,870 --> 01:13:07,838
Oh, thank God!

1399
01:13:10,250 --> 01:13:13,094
I'm glad you think
so highly of me.

1400
01:13:14,128 --> 01:13:15,175
No.

1401
01:13:15,672 --> 01:13:17,265
Vicky, wait.

1402
01:13:18,258 --> 01:13:21,353
Oh, yeah!
Oh, my God!

1403
01:13:21,511 --> 01:13:23,013
Mia, stop.

1404
01:13:24,681 --> 01:13:26,024
9l", my God, yeah!

1405
01:13:26,182 --> 01:13:27,399
Mia, get off!

1406
01:13:27,475 --> 01:13:29,352
I'm about to! I'm about to!

1407
01:13:31,604 --> 01:13:32,696
Heather.

1408
01:13:35,024 --> 01:13:36,071
What the hell?

1409
01:13:37,193 --> 01:13:38,866
You have something going on
with this skank?

1410
01:13:40,363 --> 01:13:43,037
Who are you calling a
skank, you fucking bitch?

1411
01:13:43,574 --> 01:13:45,292
Whoa! Whoa!

1412
01:13:45,743 --> 01:13:46,915
Stop it! Stop!

1413
01:13:47,078 --> 01:13:48,079
Stop it!

1414
01:13:49,706 --> 01:13:51,458
OW! What the fuck?

1415
01:13:51,624 --> 01:13:53,797
That's my extension, you bitch!

1416
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:55,587
You motherfucker!

1417
01:13:55,753 --> 01:13:58,006
No, Mia! Wait a minute!

1418
01:13:59,257 --> 01:14:02,227
By the way,
I fucked Mario Lopez!

1419
01:14:06,723 --> 01:14:07,724
Ooh...

1420
01:14:10,643 --> 01:14:13,237
Okay, it's my turn now.

1421
01:14:13,396 --> 01:14:15,899
Uh-uh. Not this time.

1422
01:14:16,065 --> 01:14:17,863
Wait, what about our deal?

1423
01:14:18,026 --> 01:14:21,621
Now you know how it
feels, Big Stiffy.

1424
01:14:28,786 --> 01:14:30,129
Gross!

1425
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:37,661
Fucking yuck

1426
01:14:54,631 --> 01:14:57,885
You didn't actually think I'd
fall asleep again, did you?

1427
01:14:58,051 --> 01:14:59,894
As long as you're mine,
I'm happy.

1428
01:15:00,053 --> 01:15:01,771
Jesus, Kara.
What are you doing here?

1429
01:15:01,930 --> 01:15:04,103
Your creepy friend invited
me and all my girlfriends.

1430
01:15:04,265 --> 01:15:06,643
Nice outfit, by the way.
Very kinky.

1431
01:15:07,519 --> 01:15:08,566
Oh, shit.

1432
01:15:08,770 --> 01:15:10,989
Don't worry. I locked it.

1433
01:15:13,566 --> 01:15:14,863
Oh, Jesus.

1434
01:15:18,488 --> 01:15:21,537
What the hell kind of freaky
shit is going on in here?

1435
01:15:21,699 --> 01:15:22,951
AJ, what are you doing here?

1436
01:15:23,117 --> 01:15:24,994
I followed you.
I had to see it with my own eyes.

1437
01:15:25,161 --> 01:15:28,791
First you fuck with my jet ski,
then you fuck my girlfriend?

1438
01:15:28,957 --> 01:15:31,210
No! God, no! Nothing happened.

1439
01:15:31,376 --> 01:15:32,468
You're going down, Sandler.

1440
01:15:32,585 --> 01:15:34,053
Sandler? What the...

1441
01:15:34,212 --> 01:15:35,680
Jesus Christ!

1442
01:15:37,757 --> 01:15:39,100
I'm going to kill you!

1443
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:43,100
Jim, what the fuck
are you wearing?

1444
01:15:43,263 --> 01:15:45,686
Hey, I can explain
everything! Jesus!

1445
01:15:46,474 --> 01:15:47,521
Come on! Shit!

1446
01:15:47,642 --> 01:15:49,189
Get up, gimp!

1447
01:15:49,352 --> 01:15:51,354
Come on, I'm not
fighting you, okay?

1448
01:15:51,479 --> 01:15:53,026
This is silly. I'm an adult.

1449
01:15:53,189 --> 01:15:54,236
Oh, really?

1450
01:15:54,357 --> 01:15:56,325
Because to me you look
like a little bitch pussy.

1451
01:15:57,485 --> 01:15:59,237
Don't be a pussy, Jim.

1452
01:15:59,404 --> 01:16:01,998
Look, AJ, just calm down, okay?

1453
01:16:02,156 --> 01:16:05,251
What makes you little fuckers think you can
crash one of the Stifmeister's parties?

1454
01:16:05,952 --> 01:16:08,796
Did you just refer to yourself
as "the Stifmeister"?

1455
01:16:08,955 --> 01:16:12,084
Because that's the
lamest name ever!

1456
01:16:14,669 --> 01:16:16,797
I'm going to fucking kill you.

1457
01:16:16,963 --> 01:16:17,930
Bring it on.

1458
01:16:18,006 --> 01:16:19,508
Hey, Steve, come on, this is...

1459
01:16:24,846 --> 01:16:26,598
Where do you think
you're going?

1460
01:16:31,519 --> 01:16:34,238
Don't mess with
the Class of '99, bitch!

1461
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:36,612
Finch!

1462
01:16:37,275 --> 01:16:38,447
Don't hurt my friend!

1463
01:16:53,374 --> 01:16:54,375
Hey!

1464
01:16:54,667 --> 01:16:57,716
Get off my husband,
you little piece of shit!

1465
01:17:09,641 --> 01:17:12,645
Oh, crap! It's the fuzz!

1466
01:17:13,394 --> 01:17:15,613
We have to get out.
How do you get out?

1467
01:17:15,813 --> 01:17:17,030
I need an escape route!

1468
01:17:17,190 --> 01:17:18,783
Oh, shit!

1469
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:19,947
You want to be with him?

1470
01:17:20,026 --> 01:17:22,654
Fine! He's all yours.

1471
01:17:22,820 --> 01:17:24,242
Come on, man!

1472
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:28,618
Jim, what's going on?

1473
01:17:28,785 --> 01:17:30,833
I am so sorry for all
of this. I can explain.

1474
01:17:31,537 --> 01:17:33,835
Last night I ran into
Kara, our neighbor.

1475
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:37,089
She was too drunk to drive,
so I drove her home.

1476
01:17:37,251 --> 01:17:42,052
And she started taking off her
clothes, and touching my...

1477
01:17:42,382 --> 01:17:45,807
Okay, I know it doesn't sound
good, but nothing happened, okay?

1478
01:17:45,968 --> 01:17:48,062
I don't care about her at all!

1479
01:17:48,221 --> 01:17:50,770
Thanks a lot.

1480
01:17:51,182 --> 01:17:53,685
No, no, Kara, wait.
I didn't mean...

1481
01:17:53,851 --> 01:17:55,569
Wait, Michelle.
Hold on, hold on.

1482
01:17:55,728 --> 01:17:57,150
It's not what you think, okay?

1483
01:17:57,313 --> 01:18:01,819
I swear, I was just trying to
do the right thing, and I...

1484
01:18:01,901 --> 01:18:04,529
You have to believe
me, Michelle, please.

1485
01:18:05,446 --> 01:18:08,575
Whether I believe you or not,

1486
01:18:08,783 --> 01:18:10,160
I'm disappointed.

1487
01:18:10,576 --> 01:18:13,045
I'm going to stay
with my grandmother.

1488
01:18:13,204 --> 01:18:14,205
Hold it, Michelle.

1489
01:18:14,288 --> 01:18:15,289
No, Jim.

1490
01:18:15,915 --> 01:18:17,462
Hey, the fight's over, guys.

1491
01:18:17,625 --> 01:18:19,047
We're not here to stop a fight.

1492
01:18:19,293 --> 01:18:21,637
We're here about
that stolen motorcycle.

1493
01:18:21,796 --> 01:18:23,469
Looks like the VIN
numbers match up.

1494
01:18:23,631 --> 01:18:24,883
Paul Finch.

1495
01:18:25,049 --> 01:18:26,801
You're under arrest.

1496
01:18:28,136 --> 01:18:29,388
Awesome!

1497
01:18:29,721 --> 01:18:30,893
Excuse me, officer.

1498
01:18:30,972 --> 01:18:33,248
He won that bike betting on
the World Cup in Argentina.

1499
01:18:33,249 --> 01:18:35,523
You made some sort of mistake.

1500
01:18:35,601 --> 01:18:37,569
Paul, what's going on?
What is this about?

1501
01:18:37,854 --> 01:18:39,026
Paul.

1502
01:18:39,188 --> 01:18:40,485
Finch, just tell them.

1503
01:18:40,648 --> 01:18:41,820
Paul!

1504
01:18:43,067 --> 01:18:46,571
Hey, shitbreak, when you're
getting rammed by your cellmate tonight,

1505
01:18:46,738 --> 01:18:47,864
think of Kevin.

1506
01:18:51,909 --> 01:18:53,911
Michelle, can I just... Please!

1507
01:18:57,832 --> 01:18:58,879
Oh!

1508
01:18:59,625 --> 01:19:00,672
Ah!

1509
01:19:01,544 --> 01:19:02,796
Dad? Ah!

1510
01:19:07,341 --> 01:19:08,342
Dad?

1511
01:19:09,260 --> 01:19:10,682
Dad, what are you doing?

1512
01:19:10,845 --> 01:19:13,598
You didn't see me!
I'm not here!

1513
01:19:13,765 --> 01:19:14,937
I'm not here!

1514
01:19:16,517 --> 01:19:17,689
Is he all right?

1515
01:19:18,352 --> 01:19:20,025
I don't know.

1516
01:19:20,521 --> 01:19:22,023
What are we going
to do about Finch?

1517
01:19:22,190 --> 01:19:24,443
Fuck Finch. Let him
spend the night in jail.

1518
01:19:24,609 --> 01:19:25,826
Come on, Stifler!

1519
01:19:25,902 --> 01:19:27,119
Some friend you are.

1520
01:19:29,447 --> 01:19:30,915
What about you guys?

1521
01:19:31,115 --> 01:19:34,164
You don't call me,
you don't e-mail,

1522
01:19:34,243 --> 01:19:36,371
you don't comment
on my Facebook page.

1523
01:19:36,454 --> 01:19:38,752
You guys didn't even let me know you
were coming back for the reunion.

1524
01:19:38,915 --> 01:19:42,215
Because we knew, somehow, you would
find a way to screw things up.

1525
01:19:42,710 --> 01:19:44,383
Oh, I'm sorry, Jim.

1526
01:19:44,545 --> 01:19:46,138
I wanted us to have
a fucking fun time

1527
01:19:46,214 --> 01:19:47,716
this weekend,
like we did in high school.

1528
01:19:47,882 --> 01:19:49,884
But we're not in
high school any more.

1529
01:19:50,051 --> 01:19:51,553
You are so trapped
in the past, Stifler.

1530
01:19:51,719 --> 01:19:54,768
When are you going to realize that things
will never be the way they used to be?

1531
01:20:01,896 --> 01:20:03,113
Fine.

1532
01:20:04,315 --> 01:20:06,113
Guess the party's over.

1533
01:20:08,402 --> 01:20:09,654
Dicks.

1534
01:20:42,186 --> 01:20:44,484
Well, that was a great party.

1535
01:20:44,939 --> 01:20:47,317
I honestly think I had fun.

1536
01:20:49,277 --> 01:20:51,996
Well, that makes one of us.

1537
01:20:54,323 --> 01:20:55,666
Have you heard from Michelle?

1538
01:20:55,825 --> 01:20:59,079
No. She doesn't
want to talk to me.

1539
01:20:59,370 --> 01:21:01,168
What about the reunion tonight?

1540
01:21:01,247 --> 01:21:03,375
She said she may
or may not come.

1541
01:21:03,541 --> 01:21:05,339
What's going on with you two?

1542
01:21:05,501 --> 01:21:07,048
Jim, is there anything
you want to talk about?

1543
01:21:11,090 --> 01:21:12,262
Okay.

1544
01:21:13,009 --> 01:21:14,135
Um...

1545
01:21:15,344 --> 01:21:17,938
How often

1546
01:21:18,097 --> 01:21:21,442
did you and Mom...

1547
01:21:24,604 --> 01:21:25,901
You know?

1548
01:21:25,980 --> 01:21:28,074
Is that what this is about?

1549
01:21:28,149 --> 01:21:29,992
You and Michelle
haven't been...

1550
01:21:30,151 --> 01:21:31,994
Not lately, no.

1551
01:21:32,069 --> 01:21:33,116
Oh...

1552
01:21:35,656 --> 01:21:37,499
ls it

1553
01:21:37,658 --> 01:21:39,160
an erectile problem?

1554
01:21:39,994 --> 01:21:44,340
Because sometimes you
can buy a little time

1555
01:21:44,498 --> 01:21:45,795
with a well-placed thumb.

1556
01:21:45,875 --> 01:21:47,752
Oh, God. I'm just saying.

1557
01:21:47,835 --> 01:21:49,712
I don't think that's it.
That's not it?

1558
01:21:50,004 --> 01:21:54,805
Oh! That's something to keep in your
back pocket, because that's a no-fail.

1559
01:21:54,967 --> 01:21:56,640
Okay, let's be done with that.

1560
01:21:56,802 --> 01:22:00,227
No, things in that
department were fine.

1561
01:22:01,432 --> 01:22:03,526
And then Evan was born

1562
01:22:03,726 --> 01:22:06,605
and we kind of stopped.

1563
01:22:06,854 --> 01:22:10,700
And they haven't really
picked up since, you know?

1564
01:22:11,484 --> 01:22:14,738
This is not a problem,
so do not worry.

1565
01:22:14,862 --> 01:22:16,705
You understand?
Yeah, listen, Jim.

1566
01:22:16,864 --> 01:22:18,332
Before you were born,

1567
01:22:18,407 --> 01:22:21,377
your mother and I,
we would do it every day.

1568
01:22:21,452 --> 01:22:22,453
I don't need this.

1569
01:22:22,536 --> 01:22:24,880
Sometimes two or
three times a day.

1570
01:22:24,956 --> 01:22:28,551
This is back in the '70s.
A lot of experimentation was going on.

1571
01:22:28,751 --> 01:22:33,473
Your mother favored something she
called, "diving for dollars."

1572
01:22:33,714 --> 01:22:36,593
Holy shit. I'm sorry,
I don't need...

1573
01:22:36,676 --> 01:22:39,054
That's fine, we can...

1574
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:40,472
I don't have to
go on with that.

1575
01:22:40,554 --> 01:22:46,027
But my point is, when you have a
kid, you become a dad and a mom.

1576
01:22:46,394 --> 01:22:50,615
But it's very important not to
stop being a husband and a wife.

1577
01:22:51,190 --> 01:22:54,740
And if you do that,
the sex will come.

1578
01:22:56,821 --> 01:22:58,289
That actually
makes a lot of sense.

1579
01:22:58,447 --> 01:23:01,826
But you can't just wait for
the two of you to be alone.

1580
01:23:01,993 --> 01:23:05,463
You have to make
your own alone time.

1581
01:23:05,663 --> 01:23:09,338
Why do you think you went to
Hebrew school three times a week?

1582
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:13,505
Sundays, noon to three?
Tuesdays, four to seven?

1583
01:23:13,629 --> 01:23:14,926
Okay, I get it, Dad.

1584
01:23:15,006 --> 01:23:17,225
If you get it,
then why the questions?

1585
01:23:17,383 --> 01:23:18,475
I'm sorry.

1586
01:23:18,551 --> 01:23:20,645
You're going through this, I am sorry.
I should be listening.

1587
01:23:20,803 --> 01:23:23,807
No, I'm overreacting.
I'm sorry.

1588
01:23:27,643 --> 01:23:29,361
Thank you.

1589
01:23:29,895 --> 01:23:31,818
Again. Really.

1590
01:23:35,234 --> 01:23:36,486
Anytime.

1591
01:23:41,323 --> 01:23:42,916
Welcome, you guys.

1592
01:23:42,992 --> 01:23:46,542
Listen, find your nametag, find
out what table you're sitting at.

1593
01:23:46,620 --> 01:23:48,873
Ashley, so good to see you!
Oh, my God.

1594
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:52,089
Billy! Oh, my God,
you're looking so svelte.

1595
01:23:52,251 --> 01:23:55,380
You used to be morbidly obese.
I was concerned.

1596
01:23:55,463 --> 01:23:56,555
Hey.

1597
01:23:56,630 --> 01:23:57,722
Hey, guys.

1598
01:23:57,798 --> 01:23:59,471
Hey, Jim. Oz.

1599
01:23:59,759 --> 01:24:00,931
Where is Mia?

1600
01:24:01,010 --> 01:24:03,138
She flew out this morning.

1601
01:24:03,304 --> 01:24:05,648
Oh. I'm sorry, man.

1602
01:24:06,474 --> 01:24:07,521
What about Michelle?

1603
01:24:08,768 --> 01:24:10,645
I am not sure yet.

1604
01:24:11,353 --> 01:24:12,650
ALL; Finch!

1605
01:24:12,855 --> 01:24:16,200
What happened? I called the police
department a thousand times.

1606
01:24:16,275 --> 01:24:21,156
I appreciate that, Kevin.
But my mom, actually, bailed me out.

1607
01:24:22,907 --> 01:24:24,409
Guys, I screwed up.

1608
01:24:24,575 --> 01:24:26,669
That bike belongs to my boss.

1609
01:24:26,827 --> 01:24:31,173
And I was promised a raise,
and I didn't get it, so I

1610
01:24:31,290 --> 01:24:32,542
simply borrowed it.

1611
01:24:33,334 --> 01:24:35,837
The truth is that my life
isn't interesting at all.

1612
01:24:36,337 --> 01:24:40,342
I am an assistant manager at a
Staples in Bayonne, New Jersey.

1613
01:24:40,591 --> 01:24:43,811
I lied to my best friends,
and I'm sorry.

1614
01:24:45,221 --> 01:24:48,316
You know, Finch,
just because you sold out

1615
01:24:48,390 --> 01:24:51,394
and got a boring job
like most of us,

1616
01:24:51,477 --> 01:24:53,104
that doesn't mean you
should be embarrassed.

1617
01:24:53,187 --> 01:24:55,781
Yeah, come on, man.
None of that shit matters.

1618
01:24:56,857 --> 01:24:58,109
That means a lot, gentlemen.

1619
01:24:58,275 --> 01:24:59,652
What about your arm?

1620
01:24:59,735 --> 01:25:00,736
Oh.

1621
01:25:02,363 --> 01:25:05,116
I spilled coffee on myself
while I was driving.

1622
01:25:05,282 --> 01:25:06,454
No.

1623
01:25:07,201 --> 01:25:08,874
It hurt like a bitch, though.

1624
01:25:08,994 --> 01:25:11,838
I'll bet. Jesus, Finch.

1625
01:25:12,206 --> 01:25:14,629
Oh, hey, check this
out, you guys.

1626
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:18,054
Crazy, huh? Look at us.

1627
01:25:18,212 --> 01:25:19,384
A lot of memories.

1628
01:25:21,382 --> 01:25:23,009
"Steve Stifler."

1629
01:25:23,968 --> 01:25:26,892
"Hopes to keep the party
going with his boys."

1630
01:25:30,850 --> 01:25:32,602
Any sign of him yet?

1631
01:25:32,768 --> 01:25:34,486
I don't think
he's going to show.

1632
01:25:50,035 --> 01:25:51,252
Stifler?

1633
01:25:55,332 --> 01:25:56,424
How'd you find me?

1634
01:25:56,584 --> 01:25:57,927
We asked your mom.

1635
01:25:58,752 --> 01:26:01,255
Oh, no. I didn't do anything.

1636
01:26:02,590 --> 01:26:07,346
We wanted to apologize
for what we said last night.

1637
01:26:07,928 --> 01:26:08,929
We didn't mean it.

1638
01:26:10,347 --> 01:26:14,272
Yeah, you did.
I get it, you guys think I'm a dick.

1639
01:26:18,939 --> 01:26:21,237
Okay. Well,

1640
01:26:22,109 --> 01:26:24,532
maybe you are kind of a dick.

1641
01:26:25,446 --> 01:26:26,538
But,

1642
01:26:27,531 --> 01:26:29,283
you're a fun dick.

1643
01:26:29,450 --> 01:26:32,499
And you're our dick.

1644
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:37,967
Yeah, man. You were one of the biggest
reasons that high school was awesome.

1645
01:26:38,125 --> 01:26:40,799
Yeah, high school was awesome.

1646
01:26:40,961 --> 01:26:43,760
Then we graduated and everybody
started getting jobs

1647
01:26:43,923 --> 01:26:46,142
and getting married
and having kids

1648
01:26:46,217 --> 01:26:48,595
and all that other stupid shit.

1649
01:26:48,761 --> 01:26:52,436
Now, look at me.
I'm the bitch of this place.

1650
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:54,608
Look, Stifler, none of
our lives are perfect.

1651
01:26:54,767 --> 01:26:55,984
Especially mine.

1652
01:26:56,936 --> 01:27:01,316
But what do you say we keep this party
going, and hit up this reunion together?

1653
01:27:03,150 --> 01:27:05,118
What the hell is going on here?

1654
01:27:05,861 --> 01:27:09,365
Oh, my God.
This is the jackass.

1655
01:27:09,782 --> 01:27:12,251
You're not even close to being
finished and you're up here

1656
01:27:12,326 --> 01:27:14,454
"chilling with your posse"?

1657
01:27:14,578 --> 01:27:15,795
Sorry, we can explain.

1658
01:27:15,955 --> 01:27:17,252
No, Kevin.

1659
01:27:18,666 --> 01:27:19,758
Allow me.

1660
01:27:19,833 --> 01:27:22,461
Yeah, Kevin, allow him.

1661
01:27:22,544 --> 01:27:23,761
This better be good, Stafler.

1662
01:27:24,338 --> 01:27:26,340
It's Stifler, fucker.

1663
01:27:26,674 --> 01:27:30,679
Oh, wow.
Who the hell do you think you are?

1664
01:27:30,844 --> 01:27:34,348
Are you acting tough in front
of your girlfriend? Huh?

1665
01:27:34,431 --> 01:27:36,433
Because we both know she's
only with you for your money.

1666
01:27:37,268 --> 01:27:38,611
Definitely not for your dick.

1667
01:27:38,769 --> 01:27:40,612
Because anybody that's
peed next to you

1668
01:27:40,688 --> 01:27:42,531
knows it's the size of
a leprechaun's pinkie.

1669
01:27:44,108 --> 01:27:46,110
That's not true.

1670
01:27:46,193 --> 01:27:49,538
"That's not
true." Oh, yeah, it is.

1671
01:27:50,625 --> 01:27:54,380
Look, just because you got a fancy
office and I don't even have a desk

1672
01:27:54,545 --> 01:27:56,843
doesn't change
who we really are.

1673
01:27:57,006 --> 01:28:00,556
The truth is,
you're still a dork,

1674
01:28:00,718 --> 01:28:02,641
and I can still kick your ass.

1675
01:28:03,554 --> 01:28:05,227
But I'm not going to.

1676
01:28:05,389 --> 01:28:06,891
You know why?

1677
01:28:07,058 --> 01:28:09,026
Because I'm the
fucking Stifmeister.

1678
01:28:09,227 --> 01:28:14,081
And if you even look at me again.
I will shit in your briefcase

1679
01:28:14,502 --> 01:28:15,686
Dudes?

1680
01:28:22,147 --> 01:28:25,822
By the way, I had no clue what I
was doing with any of this shit,

1681
01:28:25,984 --> 01:28:28,328
so you got a lot of work to do.

1682
01:29:03,021 --> 01:29:04,694
Surprise! Hey! You made it.

1683
01:29:04,856 --> 01:29:06,108
Of course.

1684
01:29:06,274 --> 01:29:07,401
What do you think about
the Lions this year?

1685
01:29:07,402 --> 01:29:08,527
They got a shot?

1686
01:29:08,693 --> 01:29:11,071
We'll see if their
offensive line can hold.

1687
01:29:11,238 --> 01:29:13,866
<i>Are you planning on being on
- All Stars?</i>

1688
01:29:14,032 --> 01:29:15,955
I actually haven't
thought much about that.

1689
01:29:16,118 --> 01:29:18,166
You should think about it.

1690
01:29:22,791 --> 01:29:26,136
I'm sorry, guys,
you'll have to excuse me.

1691
01:29:30,715 --> 01:29:32,058
Can I cut in?

1692
01:29:32,634 --> 01:29:35,228
I don't know.
Can you promise to keep your shirt on?

1693
01:29:36,096 --> 01:29:38,895
Come on, buddy, I'm busting balls.
Huh?

1694
01:29:38,974 --> 01:29:41,068
Yeah, of course.

1695
01:29:41,393 --> 01:29:42,736
I'll get us some drinks.

1696
01:29:42,811 --> 01:29:43,937
Okay.

1697
01:29:45,730 --> 01:29:48,279
Hey.

1698
01:29:49,317 --> 01:29:51,615
Shouldn't you be dancing
with your girlfriend?

1699
01:29:51,778 --> 01:29:52,779
Uh...

1700
01:29:53,905 --> 01:29:57,079
Mia and I are over.

1701
01:29:58,577 --> 01:30:03,253
She wanted me
to be someone else.

1702
01:30:03,790 --> 01:30:07,465
Something that I
don't want to be.

1703
01:30:08,587 --> 01:30:10,760
What do you want, Chris?

1704
01:30:11,256 --> 01:30:13,600
Heather, I want this.

1705
01:30:14,009 --> 01:30:15,306
I want us.

1706
01:30:16,761 --> 01:30:20,265
What about your career? LA?

1707
01:30:20,432 --> 01:30:23,732
Look, I know that it's crazy.

1708
01:30:23,894 --> 01:30:28,650
And I don't have all the answers
right now, but I see you,

1709
01:30:30,025 --> 01:30:31,493
and I just know

1710
01:30:32,736 --> 01:30:33,908
I want you.

1711
01:30:35,447 --> 01:30:36,573
I love you.

1712
01:30:37,782 --> 01:30:39,159
I love you.

1713
01:30:46,124 --> 01:30:47,216
So, I'm skiing down a mountain.

1714
01:30:47,292 --> 01:30:48,635
Guy has a heart
attack right there.

1715
01:30:48,793 --> 01:30:51,672
Saved his life.
It was a big story, you can Google it.

1716
01:30:51,838 --> 01:30:52,964
Yeah, it was.

1717
01:30:53,131 --> 01:30:54,474
I bet.

1718
01:30:55,467 --> 01:30:57,640
Holy shit! Excuse me.

1719
01:30:57,802 --> 01:31:00,225
Hey, excuse me.
What the hell is going on?

1720
01:31:00,639 --> 01:31:01,765
Ron, I can explain.

1721
01:31:01,848 --> 01:31:03,225
Seriously, this guy?

1722
01:31:03,391 --> 01:31:05,644
I'm a fucking heart surgeon,
this guy's not even on ESPN.

1723
01:31:05,810 --> 01:31:07,608
Hey, take it easy, Ron.

1724
01:31:07,771 --> 01:31:10,115
What are you going to do?
Hit me, Oz? Huh?

1725
01:31:10,273 --> 01:31:13,197
Oh, I got an idea.
What about a dance-off? Huh?

1726
01:31:14,152 --> 01:31:16,996
This isn't a reality show, okay?
This is the real world.

1727
01:31:17,155 --> 01:31:20,500
You take one swing at me, I will
sue you for all you're worth.

1728
01:31:24,955 --> 01:31:27,424
I'm not worth jack shit, Dron.

1729
01:31:30,001 --> 01:31:31,218
I'm your dick.

1730
01:31:34,214 --> 01:31:35,261
Dropped him!

1731
01:31:35,340 --> 01:31:36,341
That was awesome!

1732
01:31:36,508 --> 01:31:38,681
Listen, we had a blast
the other night.

1733
01:31:39,844 --> 01:31:42,313
Have you ever thought about
being a party planner?

1734
01:31:42,847 --> 01:31:45,270
Because we want you
to plan our wedding.

1735
01:31:45,350 --> 01:31:46,897
Say yes.

1736
01:31:47,894 --> 01:31:49,862
Yeah, yeah! I'd love to.

1737
01:31:49,938 --> 01:31:51,736
Nice! Oh, my God.

1738
01:31:51,898 --> 01:31:53,616
Thanks! This is great, man.

1739
01:31:53,775 --> 01:31:56,403
Thank you so much.
Thank you, bro.

1740
01:31:56,569 --> 01:31:58,037
You're welcome. Thank you.

1741
01:32:03,827 --> 01:32:04,919
I have to tell you something.

1742
01:32:04,995 --> 01:32:06,121
You don't have to explain.

1743
01:32:06,705 --> 01:32:11,051
Look, Paul, I didn't like you
because you climbed the Alps,

1744
01:32:11,209 --> 01:32:13,211
or killed a camel
with your bare hands.

1745
01:32:13,545 --> 01:32:16,048
I liked you because you were
still the same good guy

1746
01:32:16,131 --> 01:32:18,384
that was actually nice
to me in high school.

1747
01:32:19,009 --> 01:32:20,261
I'm still that guy.

1748
01:32:20,677 --> 01:32:22,395
I really am.

1749
01:32:23,138 --> 01:32:25,857
You know, the last time I
was here was for prom.

1750
01:32:27,100 --> 01:32:28,397
I didn't have a date.

1751
01:32:28,476 --> 01:32:29,728
Neither did I.

1752
01:32:32,397 --> 01:32:33,523
I have to get a drink.

1753
01:32:33,648 --> 01:32:35,150
What?

1754
01:32:35,317 --> 01:32:36,364
Was my dancing that bad?

1755
01:32:36,443 --> 01:32:37,490
Yeah.

1756
01:32:37,902 --> 01:32:39,575
Kev! Hey!

1757
01:32:39,654 --> 01:32:40,655
Hey, Jess!

1758
01:32:40,739 --> 01:32:42,537
Wow. Look, you have a beard!
It looks great.

1759
01:32:42,615 --> 01:32:44,583
Thanks. I'm kidding.

1760
01:32:44,701 --> 01:32:47,079
Let's just get this out of the way.

1761
01:32:47,245 --> 01:32:48,872
I'm a lesbian now, and
this is my girlfriend.

1762
01:32:48,873 --> 01:32:50,499
This is Ingrid.

1763
01:32:50,665 --> 01:32:52,383
Good to meet you.
Nice to meet you, too.

1764
01:32:52,542 --> 01:32:55,216
Lesbians? I knew it!

1765
01:32:55,295 --> 01:32:57,093
Why don't you guys
make out and prove it.

1766
01:32:57,255 --> 01:33:00,350
You must be Stifler.
I've heard a lot about you. Ow!

1767
01:33:00,425 --> 01:33:01,893
Mostly negative.

1768
01:33:02,093 --> 01:33:04,187
Cool, dude. What the fuck?

1769
01:33:04,262 --> 01:33:06,105
Jessica, it's good to see you.

1770
01:33:06,222 --> 01:33:07,348
No, it wasn't.

1771
01:33:07,432 --> 01:33:08,558
What the...

1772
01:33:09,017 --> 01:33:11,770
Look, Kev, I think you
should go talk to Vicky.

1773
01:33:12,020 --> 01:33:14,114
She's really upset over there.

1774
01:33:14,939 --> 01:33:17,033
Yeah, thanks.

1775
01:33:17,108 --> 01:33:18,485
Nice to meet you.

1776
01:33:18,568 --> 01:33:20,787
Be a real man,
you have a beard now.

1777
01:33:24,741 --> 01:33:26,709
Kevin, don't. I'm fine.

1778
01:33:26,868 --> 01:33:30,463
Come on.
I was a complete jerk last night.

1779
01:33:30,622 --> 01:33:33,501
I was just upset that you would
think that I would do that

1780
01:33:33,666 --> 01:33:35,293
knowing that you're married.

1781
01:33:35,835 --> 01:33:37,508
I know you wouldn't.

1782
01:33:37,670 --> 01:33:41,265
Honestly, that was more
about me being nervous.

1783
01:33:42,342 --> 01:33:46,438
Seeing you again, all these
old feelings came up, and...

1784
01:33:46,596 --> 01:33:49,315
I don't know, I guess
I just felt guilty.

1785
01:33:50,183 --> 01:33:54,359
But the fact that I still
have feelings for you

1786
01:33:54,521 --> 01:33:57,274
just means that what
we had was special.

1787
01:33:57,440 --> 01:33:59,317
Don't get me wrong, all right.

1788
01:33:59,484 --> 01:34:02,784
I love Ellie
more than anything.

1789
01:34:02,946 --> 01:34:05,449
But no matter
how much time passes

1790
01:34:06,199 --> 01:34:08,167
you'll always be my first love.

1791
01:34:11,204 --> 01:34:12,330
And you'll always be mine.

1792
01:34:12,997 --> 01:34:14,044
Kev. Hey.

1793
01:34:14,207 --> 01:34:16,175
You have to try these
cupcakes, they're awesome.

1794
01:34:16,251 --> 01:34:18,379
Ellie, this is Vicky.

1795
01:34:18,628 --> 01:34:22,883
Oh, my God! The Vicky?
Kevin has told me so much about you.

1796
01:34:23,007 --> 01:34:26,011
You're a really lucky girl.
He's a great guy.

1797
01:34:27,262 --> 01:34:28,980
Come dance with us.
No, it's okay.

1798
01:34:29,139 --> 01:34:31,892
Yes, come on, this is
happening. Come on.

1799
01:35:11,556 --> 01:35:12,603
Hey.

1800
01:35:13,641 --> 01:35:14,642
Hey.

1801
01:35:18,062 --> 01:35:19,188
My name's Jim.

1802
01:35:20,148 --> 01:35:23,322
We were in Mr. Lee's
English class together.

1803
01:35:23,568 --> 01:35:24,615
Really?

1804
01:35:25,403 --> 01:35:29,579
Yeah, I...
Sorry, I don't remember you.

1805
01:35:29,782 --> 01:35:30,908
Okay.

1806
01:35:32,118 --> 01:35:35,622
I was the kid who everyone
saw on the Internet.

1807
01:35:35,997 --> 01:35:36,998
Mmm.

1808
01:35:37,081 --> 01:35:40,301
Sorry, you're going to
have to be more specific.

1809
01:35:40,460 --> 01:35:42,133
I pre-ejaculated twice.

1810
01:35:42,253 --> 01:35:43,755
Oh, Jim Levenstein! Right!

1811
01:35:43,838 --> 01:35:46,307
Levenstein.
Yeah, Jim Levenstein.

1812
01:35:46,466 --> 01:35:48,969
Now I remember. Yeah.

1813
01:35:49,844 --> 01:35:52,267
So, how have you been
since high school?

1814
01:35:52,639 --> 01:35:55,438
Pretty good. Yeah, pretty good.
Let's see.

1815
01:35:55,767 --> 01:35:56,768
Um...

1816
01:35:57,268 --> 01:35:58,269
Oh!

1817
01:36:00,939 --> 01:36:03,442
I married the most wonderful
woman in the world.

1818
01:36:05,735 --> 01:36:07,453
And we have
the cutest kid ever.

1819
01:36:08,821 --> 01:36:11,950
It sounds like
things are perfect.

1820
01:36:12,784 --> 01:36:15,628
I'm willing to do whatever
it takes to make it perfect.

1821
01:36:16,871 --> 01:36:21,047
And that means being the
sexiest husband possible.

1822
01:36:21,960 --> 01:36:23,086
Really?

1823
01:36:23,836 --> 01:36:25,179
Michelle, you look beautiful.

1824
01:36:25,547 --> 01:36:28,016
Oh, thanks.

1825
01:36:29,342 --> 01:36:30,810
Would you like to dance?

1826
01:36:31,386 --> 01:36:32,683
I'd love to.

1827
01:36:48,319 --> 01:36:49,320
Whoo!

1828
01:36:54,075 --> 01:36:55,247
Stifler.

1829
01:36:55,493 --> 01:36:58,087
Sherman? The Sherminator?

1830
01:36:58,621 --> 01:37:00,339
What the fuck
have you been up to?

1831
01:37:00,498 --> 01:37:02,876
Married. Had a kid.

1832
01:37:03,042 --> 01:37:04,760
And divorced.

1833
01:37:05,169 --> 01:37:07,718
Oh! I'm sorry.

1834
01:37:07,880 --> 01:37:09,052
Yeah, I'm sure you are.

1835
01:37:09,132 --> 01:37:12,181
But, you know what, at least I
got to keep little Furlong.

1836
01:37:13,344 --> 01:37:15,472
You named your kid
after Eddie Furlong?

1837
01:37:15,847 --> 01:37:17,190
Yes, I did. You know why?

1838
01:37:17,348 --> 01:37:20,397
Because Terminator <i>2</i> is still
the greatest film ever made.

1839
01:37:21,019 --> 01:37:24,523
Dude, you need
to get banged bad.

1840
01:37:24,548 --> 01:37:28,461
I'm gonna help you out. Your cock can
thank me later. What do you say?

1841
01:37:29,314 --> 01:37:32,219
No no. See I'm not going
to fall for that again.

1842
01:37:32,609 --> 01:37:33,696
Come on.

1843
01:37:33,697 --> 01:37:35,982
I know I was a bit of
a jerk back in the

1844
01:37:35,983 --> 01:37:38,045
day but I grown up
a lot since then.

1845
01:37:38,320 --> 01:37:40,862
Please. Let me help you out.

1846
01:37:46,230 --> 01:37:52,435
Sigh. I'm just messing with you.
Get over here you littile rascal.

1847
01:37:53,161 --> 01:37:56,791
Hey lets find you some
puss-puss. Lets go

1848
01:38:02,209 --> 01:38:03,269
Okay, we have
to get out of here.

1849
01:38:03,357 --> 01:38:04,894
It's about time. Yeah.

1850
01:38:10,183 --> 01:38:11,400
It's a lost cause.

1851
01:38:11,476 --> 01:38:14,229
All these women are either
married or came with dates.

1852
01:38:15,647 --> 01:38:16,648
Hey, Loni.

1853
01:38:17,541 --> 01:38:21,045
Dude, how would you like
to have your world blown?

1854
01:38:31,457 --> 01:38:33,926
<i>Hasta la vista, Stifler.</i>

1855
01:38:38,070 --> 01:38:41,745
Great, everybody's
getting laid but me.

1856
01:38:41,907 --> 01:38:43,204
This sucks.

1857
01:38:43,367 --> 01:38:45,165
Excuse me.

1858
01:38:46,437 --> 01:38:48,314
Hi. Hi.

1859
01:38:48,481 --> 01:38:51,530
I'm looking for Paul Finch.
Have you seen him anywhere?

1860
01:38:51,693 --> 01:38:53,411
What do you want with Finch?

1861
01:38:53,569 --> 01:38:56,664
I'm here to pick him up.
I'm his mom.

1862
01:39:00,201 --> 01:39:01,418
Finch has a mom?

1863
01:39:03,705 --> 01:39:06,709
I mean, you're Finch's mom?

1864
01:39:07,542 --> 01:39:09,886
Yeah. Are you a friend of his?

1865
01:39:10,044 --> 01:39:11,136
Oh, yeah.

1866
01:39:12,255 --> 01:39:13,802
Paul is like my best friend.

1867
01:39:13,965 --> 01:39:18,220
I love him so much.
More now than ever before.

1868
01:39:18,386 --> 01:39:21,765
In fact, I can't believe we
haven't met. I'm Steven Stifler.

1869
01:39:24,684 --> 01:39:25,810
I'm Rachel.

1870
01:39:27,645 --> 01:39:29,693
What? What is it?

1871
01:39:29,856 --> 01:39:33,611
I just got this feeling like something
really bad is about to happen.

1872
01:39:33,776 --> 01:39:38,657
Don't worry.
I'll be as quiet as a church mouse.

1873
01:39:43,244 --> 01:39:44,336
Oh, Jim!

1874
01:39:48,374 --> 01:39:49,421
Oh!

1875
01:39:51,836 --> 01:39:52,837
I want you so bad.

1876
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:54,593
Oh, you have no idea!

1877
01:39:55,423 --> 01:39:57,471
Oh, God! Oh, God!

1878
01:39:57,633 --> 01:40:01,183
Oh, God, there it is.
I don't think I can hold it any more.

1879
01:40:01,262 --> 01:40:02,263
Hold it in!

1880
01:40:02,346 --> 01:40:04,394
I'm sorry, I will.

1881
01:40:04,515 --> 01:40:05,687
I just forgot
how awesome this is.

1882
01:40:05,808 --> 01:40:07,981
Oh, yeah, I need this.

1883
01:40:10,772 --> 01:40:13,446
Oh, God, Michelle!
Fuck, I love you!

1884
01:40:13,524 --> 01:40:14,776
Jim?

1885
01:40:16,861 --> 01:40:17,862
Nadia?

1886
01:40:20,072 --> 01:40:21,073
Hey.

1887
01:40:22,116 --> 01:40:25,290
I'm sorry. You are busy, yes?

1888
01:40:26,120 --> 01:40:27,212
No. Yes.

1889
01:40:27,288 --> 01:40:28,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1890
01:40:29,123 --> 01:40:32,127
Nadia, it's so nice to see you.

1891
01:40:32,502 --> 01:40:35,176
But do you think you
could give us a minute?

1892
01:40:35,338 --> 01:40:36,305
Three.

1893
01:40:36,380 --> 01:40:37,381
Three minutes.

1894
01:40:37,548 --> 01:40:41,178
Okay! So nice you
are still together.

1895
01:40:41,260 --> 01:40:42,261
Aw!

1896
01:40:42,345 --> 01:40:44,723
And I see you've gotten
much better at this.

1897
01:40:45,431 --> 01:40:47,684
Well, thanks.

1898
01:40:52,563 --> 01:40:55,112
That's Jim?
He looks nothing like me.

1899
01:40:56,943 --> 01:41:02,074
You know, when I was in high
school, I dated a lacrosse player.

1900
01:41:02,323 --> 01:41:04,200
In fact, I dated a few of them.

1901
01:41:04,367 --> 01:41:06,369
You don't say.

1902
01:41:06,536 --> 01:41:09,710
I always wanted Paul
to be more into sports.

1903
01:41:09,872 --> 01:41:12,591
But he was never
that interested.

1904
01:41:13,084 --> 01:41:14,757
You don't have to sugarcoat it.

1905
01:41:14,919 --> 01:41:16,262
Finch was a klutz.

1906
01:41:18,756 --> 01:41:21,680
Yeah, I guess he was, but he
did not get that from me.

1907
01:41:21,884 --> 01:41:24,763
I was head cheerleader.

1908
01:41:25,096 --> 01:41:28,100
And if there's anything I
learned from lacrosse players,

1909
01:41:28,266 --> 01:41:31,816
it's that I like
to handle a stick

1910
01:41:33,479 --> 01:41:36,028
and cradle those balls.

1911
01:41:39,277 --> 01:41:40,494
I love you.

1912
01:41:41,445 --> 01:41:43,743
Are you ready for me, Stifler?

1913
01:41:48,202 --> 01:41:49,454
Oh, yeah!

1914
01:41:51,038 --> 01:41:52,631
Let's go.

1915
01:41:52,790 --> 01:41:54,713
Oh, Michelle.

1916
01:41:54,876 --> 01:41:56,799
Oh, God, Michelle.

1917
01:41:57,378 --> 01:41:59,801
You are amazing!

1918
01:42:00,172 --> 01:42:01,640
Better than the bathtub?

1919
01:42:01,716 --> 01:42:02,763
Much.

1920
01:42:04,552 --> 01:42:06,179
Better than this?

1921
01:42:06,637 --> 01:42:07,729
Ooh!

1922
01:42:11,058 --> 01:42:12,560
Of course.

1923
01:42:14,061 --> 01:42:15,984
Oh, take those off!

1924
01:42:16,147 --> 01:42:17,444
We shouldn't
be doing this.

1925
01:42:17,607 --> 01:42:18,699
Yes, we should.

1926
01:42:18,774 --> 01:42:20,617
Oh, Stifler.

1927
01:42:20,776 --> 01:42:22,323
Oh, Finch's mom!

1928
01:42:23,821 --> 01:42:25,164
Call me the Stifmeister!

1929
01:42:25,323 --> 01:42:27,746
Yeah, you are the Stifmeister.

1930
01:42:29,243 --> 01:42:30,495
MILF?

1931
01:42:37,168 --> 01:42:38,761
Oh, Finch's mom!

1932
01:42:39,003 --> 01:42:40,050
MILF.

1933
01:42:41,631 --> 01:42:42,678
MILF.

1934
01:42:46,427 --> 01:42:47,770
Tell me I'm the best.

1935
01:42:47,845 --> 01:42:49,518
You are the best!

1936
01:42:50,348 --> 01:42:51,395
MILF.

1937
01:42:52,642 --> 01:42:54,019
MILF. MILF.

1938
01:42:55,645 --> 01:42:56,862
Oh, Finch's mom!

1939
01:42:57,480 --> 01:43:02,486
MILF! MILF! MILF!

1940
01:43:04,862 --> 01:43:06,330
Yes! Yes!

1941
01:43:06,405 --> 01:43:07,827
Oh, your
son's such a dork!

1942
01:43:07,907 --> 01:43:09,830
Stop talking about him!

1943
01:43:12,244 --> 01:43:14,918
Well, our first reunion
is officially in the books.

1944
01:43:15,081 --> 01:43:18,301
I don't know about you guys, but
my night ended pretty well.

1945
01:43:18,459 --> 01:43:19,551
It was great.

1946
01:43:19,627 --> 01:43:20,970
I had a blast.
It was unforgettable.

1947
01:43:21,045 --> 01:43:22,763
Fuck yeah!
I jizzed like a racehorse.

1948
01:43:23,464 --> 01:43:25,137
What happened to you at the
end of the night, Stifler?

1949
01:43:25,216 --> 01:43:26,513
Who did you end up with?

1950
01:43:26,592 --> 01:43:29,345
A gentleman never
kisses and tells, Jim.

1951
01:43:32,223 --> 01:43:33,270
Guys?

1952
01:43:35,351 --> 01:43:37,228
I'll be right back, okay?

1953
01:43:41,148 --> 01:43:42,240
Kara!

1954
01:43:48,781 --> 01:43:50,875
HEY-HEY...

1955
01:43:51,659 --> 01:43:54,333
Look, I'm sorry about
what I said the other night.

1956
01:43:54,495 --> 01:43:57,874
No, I'm the one who
should be apologizing.

1957
01:43:58,040 --> 01:44:00,168
I can't believe the way I acted.
I'm so embarrassed.

1958
01:44:00,251 --> 01:44:01,798
Don't be.

1959
01:44:02,211 --> 01:44:05,511
When I was your age I was
pretty obsessed with sex, too.

1960
01:44:05,589 --> 01:44:06,681
I know.

1961
01:44:07,717 --> 01:44:08,809
I've seen the YouTube clip.

1962
01:44:09,301 --> 01:44:11,770
Oh, of course you did.

1963
01:44:11,929 --> 01:44:14,148
But, thanks for understanding.

1964
01:44:14,306 --> 01:44:17,105
I was thinking about it,
and you're right.

1965
01:44:17,268 --> 01:44:18,895
I should really wait
for someone special.

1966
01:44:20,604 --> 01:44:23,608
Just, it's going to be tough
to find a guy as good as you.

1967
01:44:27,028 --> 01:44:28,120
I'm sure you will.

1968
01:44:34,952 --> 01:44:37,046
I feel like a whole new
man after this weekend.

1969
01:44:37,121 --> 01:44:38,589
Kind of sucks
we have to leave, though.

1970
01:44:38,664 --> 01:44:41,793
Not me. I'm going to take
some time off my job

1971
01:44:41,876 --> 01:44:43,719
and stick around here
with Heather for a while.

1972
01:44:43,794 --> 01:44:44,886
Nice!

1973
01:44:44,962 --> 01:44:46,088
What about you, Finch?

1974
01:44:46,172 --> 01:44:49,392
Selena and I, we're planning
a little jaunt to Europe.

1975
01:44:49,550 --> 01:44:52,144
Just make sure you call your mom.
She misses you.

1976
01:44:53,012 --> 01:44:54,389
How would you know?

1977
01:44:56,182 --> 01:44:57,183
Oh...

1978
01:45:00,311 --> 01:45:02,234
I guess this is it, huh?
Back to reality?

1979
01:45:02,396 --> 01:45:04,148
We shouldn't wait
until the next reunion.

1980
01:45:04,315 --> 01:45:07,410
We should try to get
together every year.

1981
01:45:07,526 --> 01:45:10,154
What do you say,
until next time?

1982
01:45:10,237 --> 01:45:12,410
Until next time.
Until next time!

1983
01:45:22,124 --> 01:45:23,421
I fucked Finch's mom.

1984
01:45:23,542 --> 01:45:24,839
What?

1985
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:26,303
What was that?

1986
01:46:48,377 --> 01:46:49,378
Hmm?

1987
01:46:50,045 --> 01:46:51,422
What's this?

1988
01:46:52,756 --> 01:46:54,508
Oh, no, dean No, no, no.

1989
01:46:54,675 --> 01:46:56,518
No, dear. No!

1990
01:46:56,594 --> 01:46:57,595
Oh!

1991
01:47:03,475 --> 01:47:04,476
Oh...

1992
01:47:05,227 --> 01:47:08,276
Oh. Oh. Oh.

1993
01:47:08,522 --> 01:47:11,867
Ah. Oh. Oh.

1994
01:47:12,276 --> 01:47:15,155
Oh, boy. Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

1995
01:47:15,362 --> 01:47:17,456
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

1996
01:47:18,115 --> 01:47:19,708
Oh! Oh!

1997
01:47:19,783 --> 01:47:21,831
Oh, my God!

1998
01:47:22,203 --> 01:47:23,625
Ah!

1999
01:47:28,687 --> 01:47:29,426
Great movie.

2001
