<i>Mysteries in History,
with your host, Peter Graves.</i>

2
00:00:30,031 --> 00:00:33,951
<i>Although no one has ever been able
to prove their existence,</i>

3
00:00:34,118 --> 00:00:37,288
<i>a quasi-government agency,
the Men in Black,</i>

4
00:00:37,455 --> 00:00:40,791
<i>supposedly carries out operations
here on Earth</i>

5
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:45,046
<i>in order to keep us safe from aliens
throughout the galaxies.</i>

6
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:48,716
<i>Here is one of their stories
that "never happened"</i>

7
00:00:48,883 --> 00:00:53,095
<i>from one of their files
that doesn't exist.</i>

8
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:57,850
<i>1978. The leaders of Zartha
flee their planet</i>

9
00:00:58,017 --> 00:01:03,272
<i>in order to escape the clutches
of the evil Kylothian, Serleena.</i>

10
00:01:03,773 --> 00:01:07,651
<i>- Arriving on Earth, the Zarthans bring</i>-

11
00:01:08,027 --> 00:01:12,073
<i>The Light of Zartha,
a cosmic force so powerful,</i>

12
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:16,786
<i>that in the wrong hands it could
lead to the annihilation of Zartha.</i>

13
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:20,664
<i>The Zarthans' princess, Lauranna,
beseeched the Men in Black,</i>

14
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:23,209
<i>to hide the Light from Serleena.</i>

15
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:25,669
<i>But they had no choice.</i>

16
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:29,340
<i>Intervention would have meant
the destruction of the Earth.</i>

17
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:35,846
<i>However, in an act of galactic bravery,
the Men in Black subdued Serleena,</i>

18
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:38,224
<i>allowing the Zarthans to escape</i>

19
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:42,061
<i>so they might hide the Light
on another planet.</i>

20
00:01:43,187 --> 00:01:47,858
<i>Serleena, released from her captors,
vowed that the Light would be hers,</i>

21
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:52,947
<i>and that she would destroy
any planet that stood in her way.</i>

22
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:56,909
<i>And so,
never knowing what happened,</i>

23
00:01:57,076 --> 00:02:02,289
<i>the people of Earth were saved
by a secret society of protectors</i>

24
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:05,543
<i>known as the Men in Black.</i>

25
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:46,560
Harvey!

26
00:03:47,645 --> 00:03:50,189
Harvey, get over here!

27
00:03:50,648 --> 00:03:52,858
Harvey. Heel, heel!

28
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:55,277
You're barking at the moon, moron.

29
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:57,196
Harvey. Harvey!

30
00:03:57,363 --> 00:03:58,572
Harvey!

31
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:00,319
Hey, pretty lady.

32
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:02,946
You taste good.

33
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:08,160
Hey, what the...?

34
00:06:13,499 --> 00:06:15,918
Yeah, you too.

35
00:07:04,967 --> 00:07:07,428
Nothing fancy, no heroics.
By the book.

36
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,054
Got it. Hey!

37
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:12,516
Ooh. Hey, Jeff.
What's happening, buddy?

38
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:16,687
We were wondering why you're here.
The man's talking to you.

39
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:21,108
You know our arrangements.
Stay in the E, F and R subway lines

40
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:23,694
and you get all the garbage
you want.

41
00:07:23,861 --> 00:07:26,572
What the hell are you doing here,
worm boy?

42
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:29,741
Uh, Tee. Jeff, uh...

43
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:32,119
Excuse my partner.
He's new and he's...

44
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:39,209
- ...Kind of stupid.
- Whoa!

45
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:48,927
You getting big, Jeff.
Boy, what you been eating?

46
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:54,308
Oh. You like jokes, huh?

47
00:07:57,436 --> 00:07:59,021
Jeffrey!

48
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:05,986
Ah!

49
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:07,404
All right.

50
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:10,699
Sweet dreams, big boy.

51
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:47,277
Sweet dreams...

52
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,492
...big boy.

53
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:56,453
Transit authority.
Move to the forward car.

54
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,206
We got a bug
in the electrical system.

55
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:06,296
Yo! People! We got a bug
in the electrical system!

56
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,843
Now y'all running'?

57
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,720
No, no, no! Sit down!

58
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,847
It's only a 600-foot worm.

59
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:23,188
Everybody out before I knock heads.
Put the hammer down on this thing.

60
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:26,483
I'm Captain Larry Bridgewater.
I decide what happens.

61
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:29,653
Oh, oh. You decide? Oh.
Okay, come here. Come here.

62
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,863
Larry? That's my man, Jeff.

63
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,371
Larry just made a decision.
Larry need to take his ass in there.

64
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:49,339
Don't make me do this, Jeff!

65
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:17,034
Eighty-first Street.

66
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:22,205
Just a second.

67
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,376
May I have your attention, please?

68
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:29,796
We thank you
for participating in our drill.

69
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:33,050
Had this been an emergency,
you'd have been eaten.

70
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:35,761
Because you don't listen.
You're ignorant.

71
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:40,098
How a man gonna bash through...?
That's the problem with New Yorkers.

72
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:43,894
"We've seen it all. A 600-foot worm!
Save us, Mr. Black Man!"

73
00:10:44,061 --> 00:10:48,273
I ask you nice, "Move to the next
car." You just sit there like...

74
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:51,902
Thank you for participating.

75
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:55,947
Hopefully, you enjoyed our smaller,
energy-efficient subway cars.

76
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:59,534
Watch your step.
You will have a nice evening.

77
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,708
I need a cleanup crew
at 81st and Central Park West.

78
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,378
Revoke Jeff's movement privileges.

79
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:12,381
Have him escorted
to the Chambers Street station.

80
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:17,511
And please check the expiration date
on the unipod worm tranquilizers.

81
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:23,684
Sorry, fellas. Station closed.

82
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:28,230
Emergency drill. For your safety.
Do you believe these putzes?

83
00:11:29,815 --> 00:11:31,316
You're welcome.

84
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:47,249
I know, by the book.

85
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:51,878
Tee, when was the last time
we just looked at the stars?

86
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:55,048
This is a test. I can do this.

87
00:11:57,467 --> 00:12:00,053
Ever feel like you're alone
in the universe?

88
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,722
Yes.

89
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:05,350
No.

90
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:10,647
Hey, let me buy you a piece of pie.
Really?

91
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:12,649
Thanks.

92
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,153
Hey, you're not alone
in the universe.

93
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:18,530
Remove the arm.
Okay.

94
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:23,827
Please, shut up, Charlie.

95
00:12:23,994 --> 00:12:27,414
I'm tired of you constantly talking
behind my back.

96
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:33,044
You meet a girl. She's into it.
The best line you come up with is:

97
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:36,298
"Wanna come back to my place for
some tonsil hockey and egg salad?"

98
00:12:36,465 --> 00:12:39,342
Whoa! Who are you
and how'd you get in?

99
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:41,178
You like egg salad?

100
00:12:44,473 --> 00:12:45,849
Serleena!

101
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:49,269
Why didn't you say it was you?

102
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:52,647
- Where's the Light?
- Here's the deal.

103
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:55,192
You're looking for this Light.
We found it.

104
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:59,654
You want it, it'll cost you 50 mill.
Here's how it'll work. First...

105
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:02,365
Where is the Light?

106
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:12,042
We couldn't find it, but we found
a guy who might know where it is.

107
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:15,253
He runs a pizza parlor
on Spring Street.

108
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:20,383
Let's go.
And wipe your nose, idiot.

109
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:29,559
Mmm. Oh. Good pie.
Yeah.

110
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:32,562
Crowded.

111
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,523
Well, they got good pie.

112
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:41,321
What is wrong with you?

113
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,698
You're gonna neuralyze me.
No, I'm not.

114
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:46,409
You took me here
so I wouldn't make a scene.

115
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:48,411
You making a scene.

116
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:52,415
Let me ask you a question.
Why did you join MiB?

117
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:56,127
Six years in the Marines.
I like the action. Protect the planet.

118
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:59,589
You like being a hero?
You joined the wrong organization.

119
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:03,760
You ever heard of James Edwards?
No.

120
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:07,931
Well, he saved the lives of 85 people
on the subway tonight.

121
00:14:08,098 --> 00:14:10,141
No one knows he exists.

122
00:14:10,642 --> 00:14:14,563
And if no one knows he exists,
how can anyone ever love him?

123
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:21,570
Hey, how long we been partners?

124
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:24,698
Feb 1.
Five months, three days.

125
00:14:24,865 --> 00:14:27,576
Started at noon.
Nine hours.

126
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:37,085
Get married.
Have a bunch of kids.

127
00:14:37,586 --> 00:14:39,254
Okay.

128
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:47,512
Excuse me. My buddy's kind of shy,
but he thinks you are hot.

129
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:55,312
Here it is. Ta-da.

130
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:57,147
Ben, I don't know what to say.

131
00:14:57,314 --> 00:15:00,025
Years from now,
you know what people'll say?

132
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:03,528
"Employee" is spelled wrong?
Eh, they charge by the letter.

133
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:07,824
They'll say, "imagine that. Big shot
like her used to work here."

134
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:09,409
Ben...
You deserve it.

135
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:12,704
Bring up a case of Mountain Dew
from the basement.

136
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:17,292
Hey, Bruno.

137
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:22,839
Two slices of pepperoni and
information about the Light of Zartha.

138
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:26,343
- Whoever you are, don't hurt me.
- Where's the Light, Ben?

139
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:28,136
I don't know what
you're talking about.

140
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:31,056
Let me down, ma'am.
I want to report a robbery...

141
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:41,316
There.

142
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:43,151
Noise.

143
00:15:44,653 --> 00:15:46,112
Kitchen!
Oh.

144
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:52,202
You idiots see anything?

145
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:55,413
Wind blew the door open.

146
00:15:56,081 --> 00:15:58,041
Nothing out of the ordinary.

147
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:01,544
For 25 years, I've traveled
the universe looking for it.

148
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:04,673
But it never left Earth, did it?
You kept it here.

149
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:06,549
What are you talking about?

150
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:09,260
I'm running out of time.
Where's the Light?

151
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:12,222
- I don't know what you mean.
- Listen, Zarthan.

152
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:14,975
You hid the Light on Earth.
I'll find it.

153
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:18,687
Once we have the Light,
Zartha will be ours.

154
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:21,398
You're too late.
Tomorrow at midnight,

155
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:25,110
the Light will leave
the third planet and be back home.

156
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:27,612
Sorry you made the trip for nothing.

157
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:40,417
Now we don't know
if it's on Earth or not.

158
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,961
He said third planet.
It's here, you idiot.

159
00:16:43,128 --> 00:16:46,840
<i>Third Rock</i> from the Sun.
I never got that till now.

160
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:51,219
It's on Earth, and I know
who's gonna tell me where it is.

161
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:18,705
Don't you ever go home?
Nope.

162
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:21,666
I see you neuralyzed
another partner.

163
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:30,925
Bee, Dee, when you use
a fission carbonizer,

164
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:34,804
attach a de-atomizer
so it doesn't sound like a cannon.

165
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:38,308
Hey, get some booties on them things.
You're crapping up the floor.

166
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:44,105
Check his visa.

167
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:48,443
The Cephalopods have been making
counterfeits at Kinko's on Canal.

168
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:53,865
Why do I have a dead Tricrainasloph
going through passport control?

169
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:58,203
That'd be my fault. I'm very sorry.
Please don't neuralyze me, sir.

170
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:01,623
What's that supposed to mean?
Nothing, sir.

171
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:07,003
Good work in the subway.

172
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:09,005
I remember Jeff
when he was yea high.

173
00:18:09,172 --> 00:18:11,049
What you got for me?

174
00:18:11,216 --> 00:18:13,510
Look. See those guys in black suits?

175
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:16,763
They work here. We got it covered.
Zed, what you got?

176
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:21,184
Dedication's one thing, but this job
will eat you up and spit you out.

177
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:24,312
You want to look like me
when you hit 50...

178
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:26,648
ish?

179
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:29,734
I'll be in the gym if you need me.

180
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,738
All right, there was a killing earlier.
177 Spring.

181
00:18:33,905 --> 00:18:35,198
Alien-on-alien.

182
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:37,909
Take Tee with you
and make a report.

183
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:40,912
Um... Tee. Right.

184
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:43,498
What happened...
What happened with Tee...

185
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:46,668
Passports. No rush.
How they hanging, Jay?

186
00:18:46,835 --> 00:18:49,879
You have got to stop neuralyzing
MiB personnel.

187
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:52,257
He was crying
in the middle of the diner.

188
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:53,967
I hate that.

189
00:18:54,551 --> 00:18:56,761
And plus, you can't count Elle.

190
00:18:56,928 --> 00:18:59,889
She wanted to go back
to the morgue. I helped her.

191
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:02,934
You need a partner.
I'm cool.

192
00:19:03,226 --> 00:19:05,228
I'll be his partner.

193
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:09,107
Jay, wait up.
I appreciate the shot, man.

194
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:11,484
Thought I'd never get out.
Lose the suit.

195
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,862
Sure thing.
Just going for the look.

196
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:16,739
But if I say so myself,
I find it slimming.

197
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:19,534
Not that I've had problems
with the ladies.

198
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:21,286
When you get down to... Whoa.

199
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:23,204
Nice sled, very swank.

200
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:25,498
Heated seats?
Sometimes I get hives.

201
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:48,271
Frank!

202
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:52,775
Bring your head in this window
before I roll it up in there.

203
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:54,319
Got it.

204
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:01,784
Frank!

205
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:04,996
My money? It's missionary.

206
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:08,249
I was in the Bowery,
and I meet this Great Dane.

207
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,668
A little thick in the body,
but pretty.

208
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:13,963
That's just not appealing
to me, man. Seriously.

209
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,424
I say we do the
good cop, bad cop thing.

210
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:19,135
You interrogate the witness
and I growl. Grrr!

211
00:20:19,302 --> 00:20:23,556
How about we do the good cop, dumb
dog thing, and you just shut up?

212
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:26,100
You got it, partner.
Total silence.

213
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:29,604
Absolute quiet.
Not a word out of me.

214
00:20:30,313 --> 00:20:31,940
What do we got?

215
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:33,816
Zip.

216
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:37,528
What do we got?
There's residue on the wall.

217
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:42,617
We sent samples to Em for analysis.
Hey, Jay, zero percent body fat.

218
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:47,038
Funny.
Witness?

219
00:20:47,956 --> 00:20:49,540
Girl. Saw everything.

220
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:52,293
She's taking it well.

221
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:56,631
I won't answer any more questions.
I want to know what happened here.

222
00:20:56,965 --> 00:20:59,092
- I'll handle this one.
- You got it.

223
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:02,637
Alone. A talking dog might be
a bit much for her now.

224
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:04,847
What do you want me to do?

225
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:06,349
Sniff around.

226
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:09,352
What?

227
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:10,979
Funny.

228
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:13,606
Take a deep breath.
Everything is all right.

229
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:16,901
What part is she supposed
to feel all right about?

230
00:21:20,154 --> 00:21:21,698
I'm Agent Jay.

231
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:23,366
Tell me what you saw.

232
00:21:23,533 --> 00:21:26,035
A two-headed guy and a woman.
Caucasian?

233
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:29,205
Gray, with tentacles
that she used to rip...

234
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:30,456
His skin off.

235
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:35,920
It's not skin. It's protoplasma polymer
similar to the gum in baseball cards.

236
00:21:36,087 --> 00:21:38,673
What was the last thing you ate?
Calzone.

237
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,966
What time?
Lunch.

238
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:41,467
Spinach?
Mushroom.

239
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:43,219
Hm.

240
00:21:43,386 --> 00:21:44,929
You need pie.

241
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:48,099
They kept asking Ben about a light.

242
00:21:48,266 --> 00:21:50,476
Light of Zartha,
something like that.

243
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:52,520
You okay?

244
00:21:52,687 --> 00:21:55,982
An hour ago, a man I've known
my whole life vanished

245
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:58,735
because of a woman with
things coming out her fingers

246
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:01,612
and a two-headed guy
with the IQ of a cannoli.

247
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:04,449
So yeah, everything's okay.

248
00:22:06,034 --> 00:22:09,746
When we're kids,
before we're taught how to think,

249
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:13,249
our hearts tell us there is
something else out there.

250
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:18,338
I know what I saw. Tell me
what I'm supposed to believe.

251
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:29,098
I'm a member of a secret organization
that monitors alien activity on Earth.

252
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:31,476
Ben was an alien.
So were his killers.

253
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:35,646
I don't know why they did it,
but I promise I'm gonna find out.

254
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:38,900
Okay.

255
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:41,819
Okay?
Okay.

256
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:44,655
Okay.

257
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,786
Uh... Uh...

258
00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:52,747
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to...
Kill me.

259
00:22:52,914 --> 00:22:54,457
No! Ha-ha.

260
00:22:54,624 --> 00:22:58,544
Just a little flash and everything
goes back the way it was.

261
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:02,298
After you flash me,

262
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:04,926
if I see you again,
will I know it's you?

263
00:23:05,093 --> 00:23:07,136
I'll see you.

264
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:11,516
But you won't see me.

265
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:13,768
Must be hard.

266
00:23:13,935 --> 00:23:15,812
Must be very lonely.

267
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:32,620
Excuse me.

268
00:23:33,955 --> 00:23:36,958
I gotta go.
What about the flashy thing?

269
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:40,753
Uh... I'll flash you
some other time.

270
00:23:58,855 --> 00:24:00,189
What?

271
00:24:04,694 --> 00:24:10,199
Did you tell the girl you love her?
She's a witness to a crime. That's it.

272
00:24:10,408 --> 00:24:14,495
Yada, yada. You're attracted. She's
not my species, and I'm attracted.

273
00:24:14,662 --> 00:24:18,624
I should take advice on love from
a dude that chases his own ass?

274
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:22,837
Easy, pal. That's canine profiling,
and I resent it.

275
00:24:39,562 --> 00:24:40,897
Hey, Jay, wait up.

276
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:44,066
Coming through. MiB brass.
Look sharp.

277
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:48,196
I'm Agent Eff, Jay's new partner.
Who are you eyeballing, huh?

278
00:24:48,362 --> 00:24:50,615
Frank, just cool out, dog.

279
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:53,951
Got kids?
No.

280
00:24:54,118 --> 00:24:55,161
Want them?

281
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:00,750
Get him off me!

282
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:11,761
<i>Talk to me.</i>
It's Kylothian, class C.

283
00:25:11,928 --> 00:25:12,970
<i>Serleena.</i>

284
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:15,473
<i>Serleena. Old girlfriend?</i>
She wishes.

285
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,351
<i>The perps were looking
for the Light of...</i>

286
00:25:18,518 --> 00:25:20,186
Zartha.
<i>Yeah, what is it?</i>

287
00:25:20,353 --> 00:25:22,813
This makes no sense.
It's not on Earth.

288
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:26,275
We took care of this a long time ago.
Obviously not.

289
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:28,444
<i>That is very bad news.</i>

290
00:25:28,611 --> 00:25:32,323
The Zarthans came to Earth
to hide the Light from Serleena.

291
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:35,993
<i>We don't do that.</i>
Right. I ordered it off the planet.

292
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,787
Well, Zed...

293
00:25:37,954 --> 00:25:42,416
I got a Kylothian class C in my park.
Are you sure this Light isn't here?

294
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:46,170
Positive. I gave the order.
My best agent carried it out.

295
00:25:46,337 --> 00:25:48,923
It's as if I gave the order to you.
Ask <i>the</i> agent.

296
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:50,174
Can't.
<i>Dead?</i>

297
00:25:50,341 --> 00:25:52,718
Sort of. He works at the post office.

298
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:55,805
No.

299
00:25:55,972 --> 00:25:58,641
<i>If Serleena gets to Kay
before we do, he's dead.</i>

300
00:25:58,808 --> 00:26:01,852
The Earth's very existence
may rest on what Kay knows.

301
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:04,480
Too bad you wiped out
his memory of it.

302
00:26:04,647 --> 00:26:06,148
Bring him in.

303
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:07,525
Now.

304
00:26:07,692 --> 00:26:11,779
How cool is this? Going to get Kay.
The legend, the go-to guy.

305
00:26:11,946 --> 00:26:14,490
Your mentor, the guy who taught you
everything you know.

306
00:26:14,657 --> 00:26:19,287
- The greatest agent in MiB history!
- Frank! Stop talking.

307
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:24,375
Stay.

308
00:26:24,542 --> 00:26:28,296
Listen, partner. I may look like a dog,
but I only play one here on Earth.

309
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:33,050
Whatever. Wipe your mouth.
Hey, babe.

310
00:26:39,181 --> 00:26:42,310
People of Truro, may I
kindly have your attention?

311
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:44,895
To facilitate your shipping needs,

312
00:26:45,062 --> 00:26:47,732
all packages must be
properly wrapped.

313
00:26:47,898 --> 00:26:51,777
This one is an example of
"go home and do it again."

314
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:54,739
I think you know what I mean,
Mrs. Vigushin. Heh, heh.

315
00:26:54,905 --> 00:26:59,785
Brown paper and triple-twist twine
are the preferred media.

316
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:01,704
Thank you for your time.

317
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,791
Kay.
C. Express mail, two-day air.

318
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:10,379
Kevin. Heh. Wow.

319
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:13,758
Kevin. That's funny.
You don't have a "Kevin"...

320
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:18,721
You don't remember.
We worked together.

321
00:27:18,888 --> 00:27:23,017
I never worked in a funeral home.
Something I can do for you, slick?

322
00:27:23,184 --> 00:27:24,810
Straight to the point.

323
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:29,774
You were an agent of an organization
that monitors aliens on Earth.

324
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:34,028
We're the Men in Black. We have
a situation. We need your help.

325
00:27:34,195 --> 00:27:37,907
There is a free mental health clinic on
the corner of Lilac and East Valley.

326
00:27:38,074 --> 00:27:40,076
- Next.
- Excuse me.

327
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:42,620
- Twenty <i>Rugrats</i> stamps.
- Elizabeth.

328
00:27:42,787 --> 00:27:47,083
The Postal Service hasn't kept up
with today's youth, but we have

329
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:49,919
Berlin airlift stamps. Opera legends?
No. No.

330
00:27:50,086 --> 00:27:53,089
American Samoa? Amish quilts.
No.

331
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:55,966
I'm sorry, got a world to save here.

332
00:27:57,343 --> 00:27:59,387
There was no coma.
It was a cover.

333
00:27:59,553 --> 00:28:01,347
Who are you?
Who are you?

334
00:28:01,514 --> 00:28:05,810
Postmaster of Truro, Massachusetts,
and I'm ordering you to leave.

335
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:10,189
Is that decaf?
Sorry.

336
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:12,733
We have a breach.
Cordon off this area.

337
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,903
Full perimeter wipe-down,
right here, right now.

338
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:20,449
Get a mop and escort all civilian
personnel from this site immediately.

339
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:23,786
Listen to yourself, Kay.
Who talks like that?

340
00:28:30,835 --> 00:28:32,211
Boo.

341
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,678
Why do you think you're
so comfortable here?

342
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:27,850
Just about everybody who works
in a post office is an alien.

343
00:29:35,733 --> 00:29:36,901
No smoking.

344
00:29:46,702 --> 00:29:47,828
Kay.

345
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,749
My wife and I saw Siegfried and Roy
fly a tiger around a room.

346
00:29:51,916 --> 00:29:53,417
You're nothing special.

347
00:29:53,584 --> 00:29:56,504
When you look at the stars,
you get a feeling,

348
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:58,672
like you don't know who you are.

349
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:02,468
Like you know more about out there
than you do down here.

350
00:30:02,635 --> 00:30:07,223
That's why she left you, Kay.
That's why your wife left you.

351
00:30:09,225 --> 00:30:11,060
Okay, I'll tell you what.

352
00:30:11,227 --> 00:30:15,147
You want to know who you really are,
take a ride with me.

353
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:19,193
If not, people are waiting
for their <i>TV Guides.</i>

354
00:30:22,363 --> 00:30:23,864
Think he'll bite?

355
00:30:29,745 --> 00:30:33,499
I'm just going for a ride. If things
don't add up, it's <i>hasta luego.</i>

356
00:30:33,666 --> 00:30:35,251
Hey, Kay.

357
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:38,838
How's it hanging?

358
00:30:53,143 --> 00:30:54,979
Good to see you, Kay.

359
00:30:55,145 --> 00:30:58,232
Good to see you too,
whoever you are.

360
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:03,779
Well, let's see
what you got here, chief.

361
00:31:14,248 --> 00:31:16,542
Welcome back, Agent Kay.

362
00:31:17,793 --> 00:31:19,086
Agent Kay.

363
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:21,714
Greetings, Kay.

364
00:31:23,966 --> 00:31:25,301
Wow, look who's back.

365
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:28,012
I don't mean to bother you...
You're Agent Kay!

366
00:31:28,178 --> 00:31:31,348
That's what they tell me.
This is an honor. Agent Gee.

367
00:31:31,515 --> 00:31:33,976
The most respected agent
in MiB history.

368
00:31:34,143 --> 00:31:36,645
The most feared human
in the universe.

369
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:39,815
Maybe I could
buy you a cup of coffee?

370
00:31:39,982 --> 00:31:42,651
Black, two sugars, if you're going.
An honor.

371
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:46,155
- Yeah, I'll take a... My man?
- Good to see you, Kay.

372
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:49,241
How'd it go?

373
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:51,869
<i>The Drolacks are gone
and the treaty is signed.</i>

374
00:31:52,036 --> 00:31:53,078
Good work.

375
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:56,540
<i>What about that position you
promised me in Men in Black?</i>

376
00:31:56,707 --> 00:32:00,169
Still working on the alien
affirmative action program.

377
00:32:00,336 --> 00:32:02,588
<i>That's not what you promised me.</i>

378
00:32:02,755 --> 00:32:04,840
You're breaking up
<i>Zed? Hello?</i>

379
00:32:05,007 --> 00:32:08,260
I'll call you back.
<i>I could be Agent Em. Zed, you...</i>

380
00:32:09,637 --> 00:32:14,141
I think Earth might be in a bad way.
You're the only one that could save it.

381
00:32:14,308 --> 00:32:17,394
Well, neither rain, sleet, snow...
Good man.

382
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:21,482
Get him armed and up to speed
and over to deneuralyzation.

383
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:23,776
Frank?
Yeah?

384
00:32:23,984 --> 00:32:25,945
I'm gonna need them together
on this one.

385
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:27,196
Ouch.

386
00:32:27,363 --> 00:32:31,033
I need an assistant. It's not
field work, but you get dental.

387
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,701
Dental?

388
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:39,667
The most advanced technologies from all
over the universe are in this room.

389
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:41,001
What's this?

390
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,297
All is lost! All is lost!

391
00:32:46,382 --> 00:32:47,925
Don't touch that!

392
00:32:48,884 --> 00:32:50,761
I didn't do anything.

393
00:32:50,928 --> 00:32:54,098
Hands in your pockets.

394
00:33:03,524 --> 00:33:05,693
Your favorite weapon.

395
00:33:08,445 --> 00:33:10,739
That?
Yep.

396
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,325
Let's go put it on.
What?

397
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:15,828
The last suit you'll ever wear.

398
00:33:15,995 --> 00:33:17,496
Again.

399
00:33:17,663 --> 00:33:18,998
The...

400
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:26,005
The deneuralyzer.

401
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:30,634
Magneto-energy will surge
through your brain,

402
00:33:30,801 --> 00:33:35,431
unlocking information that could hold
the key to Earth's very survival.

403
00:33:35,597 --> 00:33:38,267
Okay. What's that thing?

404
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:41,645
The deneuralyzer.

405
00:33:49,111 --> 00:33:53,115
Welcome to planet Earth. There
are some rules and regulations.

406
00:33:53,282 --> 00:33:54,700
Go out only at night.

407
00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:59,121
If you must go out during the
daylight, only the East Village.

408
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:05,085
Hey, hey, hey!

409
00:34:09,298 --> 00:34:12,217
Name and planet of origin?

410
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:16,138
Sylona Gorth. Planet Jorn.
Kaluth system.

411
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:21,143
Any fruits or vegetables?
Yeah, two heads of cabbage.

412
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:22,352
Reason for visit?

413
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:26,023
Education. I want to learn
how to be an underwear model.

414
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:28,942
They told me I've got real potential.
Hmm?

415
00:34:31,487 --> 00:34:33,280
Help! Heart attack!

416
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:35,949
Clear!

417
00:34:37,201 --> 00:34:39,203
Wake up, champ!

418
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:45,459
Oh, jeez.

419
00:34:45,626 --> 00:34:47,920
<i>Lockdown. Code 101.</i>

420
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:50,798
<i>Lockdown.</i>

421
00:34:51,673 --> 00:34:54,343
This is not good.
This is not good.

422
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:02,684
Breach! We're being flushed.

423
00:35:02,851 --> 00:35:04,019
Flushed?
Yep.

424
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:06,647
Ever been to a water park?
I don't know.

425
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:42,891
Whoo! Heh. Flushed. Heh.

426
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:48,480
Yeah, man, back when you was
an agent, you loved getting flushed.

427
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:53,235
Yeah, every Saturday night, you'd
be like, "Flush me, Jay. Flush me."

428
00:35:53,402 --> 00:35:55,154
I'd be like, "No."

429
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,282
You can't quit on me.

430
00:35:58,448 --> 00:36:01,368
I save the world, you tell me
why I stare at the stars.

431
00:36:01,535 --> 00:36:03,078
Cool.

432
00:36:05,414 --> 00:36:07,124
Hop in.
Hop in what?

433
00:36:13,255 --> 00:36:16,133
Does that come standard?
It came with a black dude,

434
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:19,094
but he kept getting pulled over.
Yep.

435
00:36:21,597 --> 00:36:26,476
Silly little planet. I could rule the place
with the right set of mammary glands.

436
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:28,437
Trapped like rats

437
00:36:29,146 --> 00:36:30,230
in a Chia Pet.

438
00:36:30,397 --> 00:36:32,983
Computer, surveillance MiB.

439
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:39,615
Hmm. MiB is locked down.

440
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:45,287
Computer, magnify. Times 10.

441
00:36:46,455 --> 00:36:48,332
Communicator. Frank.

442
00:36:48,624 --> 00:36:50,959
- Jay, where are you?
<i>- We got flushed.</i>

443
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:53,295
<i>MiB is code 101.</i>
Yeah, who did it?

444
00:36:53,462 --> 00:36:56,423
Some hot-looking biker chick.
Want me to tail her?

445
00:36:56,590 --> 00:37:01,470
Stay where you are. I'll be in touch.
Stay where I am. Easy for you to say.

446
00:37:01,637 --> 00:37:03,013
Find Kay?
Neuralyzed.

447
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:05,807
Not active. Civilian.
What?

448
00:37:05,974 --> 00:37:07,017
He was...
Here.

449
00:37:07,184 --> 00:37:08,518
To get...
Deneuralyzed.

450
00:37:08,685 --> 00:37:13,232
Memory's shot. But we'll find him.
Don't put anything in our ears.

451
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:15,192
What?

452
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:18,820
What do you make of that?
Found it in my pocket. Weird, huh?

453
00:37:18,987 --> 00:37:21,740
Yeah, you're smiling.
Is that the only deneuralyzer?

454
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:24,826
Officially. The plans leaked out
on the Internet.

455
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:26,995
Computer, Internet.

456
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:28,997
Deneuralyzer.

457
00:37:33,085 --> 00:37:35,045
Perfect. It's an old friend.

458
00:37:42,844 --> 00:37:44,846
Jay, ain't seen you in a while.

459
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:47,766
Did you peep that drop-top thing
out front?

460
00:37:47,933 --> 00:37:50,060
My business is banging, dog.

461
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,939
You gotta check out the website.
It's Jeebsie dot...

462
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:56,191
Okay, whoa. He's retired, right?

463
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:58,402
We need the deneuralyzer.

464
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:01,905
You're kidding.
The meter's running, Jeebs.

465
00:38:04,324 --> 00:38:06,535
Do you remember me?

466
00:38:07,077 --> 00:38:09,204
Can't say I do.
I'm good with faces.

467
00:38:09,371 --> 00:38:11,164
Heh. I think I'd remember that.

468
00:38:12,708 --> 00:38:14,751
The great Kay's a neutral.

469
00:38:14,918 --> 00:38:19,214
You're between me and my memories. Do
you have this deneuralyzer or not?

470
00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:20,716
No.

471
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:23,385
Fresh out.

472
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:26,263
Can't help you. Heh.

473
00:38:28,348 --> 00:38:29,891
Don't got it.

474
00:38:38,567 --> 00:38:42,446
Even if I did, if it doesn't work,
he dies, you blow my head off.

475
00:38:42,612 --> 00:38:46,658
If it does, I've brought back Kay,
who, for fun, blows my head oh'.

476
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:48,744
So, what's my incentive?

477
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:53,248
Okay, homey, I keep it downstairs
next to the snow blowers.

478
00:38:56,668 --> 00:39:00,005
<i>Alien prisoners released,
armed and ready for your orders.</i>

479
00:39:00,172 --> 00:39:03,592
Prisoners of MiB,
the scum of the universe.

480
00:39:04,009 --> 00:39:05,594
Now it's the scum's turn.

481
00:39:05,761 --> 00:39:08,221
I'm in a jam,
so I'll make this simple.

482
00:39:08,638 --> 00:39:12,100
I need the Light of Zartha,
and Kay knows where it is.

483
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:14,603
Whoever brings Kay to me
gets Earth.

484
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:18,065
Find a deneuralyzer.
They want his memory back.

485
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:20,067
Check.

486
00:39:20,734 --> 00:39:22,277
Now.

487
00:39:25,655 --> 00:39:27,616
Jarra, good to see you.

488
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,497
Okay, that should do it.

489
00:39:33,663 --> 00:39:38,043
If I could have your attention while
we go over the safety procedures.

490
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:40,754
Keep your hands inside
the vehicle.

491
00:39:40,921 --> 00:39:44,007
If, during the ride,
you become disoriented,

492
00:39:44,174 --> 00:39:46,843
there's nothing we can do about it.

493
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:50,764
Have you removed all your jewelry?

494
00:39:52,349 --> 00:39:54,768
Are you allergic to shellfish?
Jeebs!

495
00:39:54,935 --> 00:39:57,729
Right, then!
Smoke 'em if you got 'em.

496
00:40:04,277 --> 00:40:05,695
Have you used this before?

497
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:09,658
I used it to make some
hot-air popcorn. That's about it.

498
00:40:09,825 --> 00:40:12,786
Okay! Let's make it happen, cap'n!

499
00:40:44,401 --> 00:40:45,861
Hm.

500
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:09,384
Perfect.

501
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:25,150
You're back.
No.

502
00:41:25,317 --> 00:41:26,693
How'd you know
his head grows back?

503
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:28,528
It grows back?

504
00:41:31,031 --> 00:41:34,910
Real nice. Okay, that's the
last time I help out a friend.

505
00:41:37,412 --> 00:41:39,915
Kay, you remember anything?
Goodbye.

506
00:41:40,081 --> 00:41:41,625
Kay, Wait! Kay!

507
00:41:42,459 --> 00:41:46,004
I never got the updated software.
Still working off the 6.0.

508
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:48,089
Your brain needs to reboot.

509
00:41:49,341 --> 00:41:50,675
Give it a minute.

510
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:52,260
Kay!

511
00:41:52,511 --> 00:41:57,766
Bottom of my heart, I'm really sorry.
I hope it won't affect our friendship.

512
00:41:57,933 --> 00:42:02,479
All those years of loyalty and trust,
respect for one another.

513
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:06,233
Right over there!

514
00:42:07,776 --> 00:42:10,237
- Where's Kay?
- He's not here! He went...

515
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:13,782
Kay's retired. I'm his
trigger-happy replacement.

516
00:42:13,949 --> 00:42:17,494
Right in the pie hole. Now
nothing's gonna taste right.

517
00:42:17,661 --> 00:42:20,121
Lower your weapon.
No.

518
00:42:25,627 --> 00:42:28,171
Jay, how are you, boo-boo?

519
00:42:28,338 --> 00:42:31,007
These guys really need Kay.
He's a neutral.

520
00:42:31,174 --> 00:42:34,844
Tell me something we don't know.
Yeah, tell me something... Achoo!

521
00:42:35,011 --> 00:42:36,638
I am so sorry.

522
00:42:36,805 --> 00:42:38,807
God bless you.
Thank you.

523
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:44,104
If I don't bring Kay back to MiB,
Serleena's gonna kick my ass.

524
00:42:44,271 --> 00:42:46,314
Now, where is he?
Where is who?

525
00:42:46,481 --> 00:42:48,650
You don't look too good.

526
00:42:49,985 --> 00:42:51,653
Yeah, and you look like crap.

527
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:57,325
I take that back. He look like crap.

528
00:42:59,953 --> 00:43:01,830
Bend him!
Bend him.

529
00:43:01,997 --> 00:43:03,873
Wait, don't bend him.

530
00:43:25,812 --> 00:43:28,106
Hey, honey, how you doing?

531
00:43:41,661 --> 00:43:43,455
Damn decent of you.

532
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:45,332
Don't mention it.

533
00:44:06,186 --> 00:44:08,980
I'm gonna be sick.
You don't wanna do that.

534
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:11,941
Fellas, I think he's telling the truth.
Then he's no good to us.

535
00:44:15,528 --> 00:44:18,531
Didn't I teach you anything, kid?
Pineal eye!

536
00:44:21,076 --> 00:44:22,786
Go for the mosh tendrils!

537
00:44:27,082 --> 00:44:28,833
Kay, he's a ball-chinnian.
Oh.

538
00:44:33,254 --> 00:44:35,799
You were in a tight spot.
I handled it.

539
00:44:35,965 --> 00:44:38,760
You need a partner.
I had one. Job got too tough.

540
00:44:38,927 --> 00:44:41,262
I'm back. You got
some dust on your coat.

541
00:44:41,429 --> 00:44:43,306
So you got your memory back.
Yeah.

542
00:44:43,473 --> 00:44:45,934
What the hell is going on?
Don't know.

543
00:44:46,101 --> 00:44:48,603
The Light of Zartha?
Never heard of it.

544
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:49,771
Cool.

545
00:44:53,316 --> 00:44:55,443
You don't remember
the Light of Zartha?

546
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:58,321
Must've neuralyzed myself
to keep it from myself.

547
00:44:58,488 --> 00:45:01,783
Good plan. What you doing?
I do the driving.

548
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:03,952
Wait, no. Whoa, whoa.
I remember that.

549
00:45:04,119 --> 00:45:08,039
What you remember is you used
to drive that old, busted jawn.

550
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:11,292
I drive the new hotness.

551
00:45:11,459 --> 00:45:15,088
Old and busted, new hotness.

552
00:45:24,013 --> 00:45:26,141
Old busted hotness.

553
00:45:26,474 --> 00:45:29,185
- Serleena, please.
- Been a long time, Zed.

554
00:45:29,352 --> 00:45:32,981
I'm just touched you remembered me.
Makes me fuzzy all over.

555
00:45:33,148 --> 00:45:36,484
Never forget a pretty
whatever you are.

556
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:39,487
Unh!
Zed?

557
00:45:40,822 --> 00:45:42,490
Zed? Look at you.

558
00:45:42,657 --> 00:45:45,660
Twenty-five years,
and you're still such a looker.

559
00:45:45,827 --> 00:45:47,537
Cut out the meat and dairy.

560
00:45:47,704 --> 00:45:51,499
And you, still a pile of squirmy
crap in a different wrapper.

561
00:45:51,833 --> 00:45:55,503
So feisty.
Look, we both need the same thing.

562
00:45:58,423 --> 00:45:59,966
Bring him in.

563
00:46:00,633 --> 00:46:01,718
Don't think so.

564
00:46:01,885 --> 00:46:05,847
What about the Light's secret?
If it's not off Earth by midnight,

565
00:46:06,014 --> 00:46:09,476
it self-destructs,
annihilating your little planet.

566
00:46:09,642 --> 00:46:13,521
I lose, you lose.
I win, everything keeps spinning.

567
00:46:13,897 --> 00:46:17,859
You don't want the Light on Earth
any more than I do.

568
00:46:20,528 --> 00:46:22,197
All right, Serleena.

569
00:46:23,448 --> 00:46:25,033
You win.

570
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:30,246
<i>Zed? Is that you?
I could be Agent Em.</i>

571
00:46:30,622 --> 00:46:32,040
<i>Zed. Hello?</i>

572
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:44,636
So feisty.

573
00:46:49,098 --> 00:46:52,769
Fastest way back to MiB,
you take this right on 39th.

574
00:46:52,936 --> 00:46:54,521
Right here. Right.

575
00:46:56,689 --> 00:46:58,441
Next right on 37th.

576
00:46:58,608 --> 00:47:01,069
Right here.
Thirty... Thirty... Right!

577
00:47:01,402 --> 00:47:02,987
We're not going back to MiB.

578
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:08,243
Headquarters has been breached. We
need to peel caps and split wigs.

579
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:10,036
Not ready.

580
00:47:10,453 --> 00:47:13,915
Look, you've been out for five years.
That's a long time.

581
00:47:14,082 --> 00:47:17,210
I understand you're scared.
I'm a little scared too.

582
00:47:17,377 --> 00:47:19,420
I'm not scared.
Me neither.

583
00:47:20,004 --> 00:47:22,423
I just thought we was bonding.

584
00:47:23,258 --> 00:47:27,345
You're acting like a rookie
. Splitting wigs and stepping on caps.

585
00:47:27,512 --> 00:47:31,599
No wonder Zed brought me back.
He did it because you messed up.

586
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:34,477
Your attitude makes for
a stressful environment.

587
00:47:34,644 --> 00:47:38,731
Tell it to the hand. Stressful
is what we got back at MiB.

588
00:47:38,898 --> 00:47:43,486
Exactly. Serleena broke into MiB
in order to lure me back.

589
00:47:43,653 --> 00:47:45,738
Into a trap.

590
00:47:45,905 --> 00:47:48,449
Which is why we can't
bust in there.

591
00:47:48,616 --> 00:47:51,619
We need a plan. Where we going?
Scene of the crime?

592
00:47:51,786 --> 00:47:55,999
You're the boss.
Scene of the crime. That's a left.

593
00:47:58,459 --> 00:48:00,962
I'll contact the witness.
We'll talk to her.

594
00:48:01,129 --> 00:48:04,382
Things have changed. We
used to neuralyze witnesses.

595
00:48:05,717 --> 00:48:07,468
See, originally, I'd, um...

596
00:48:08,469 --> 00:48:12,974
No, I was going to, uh...
I interrogated her.

597
00:48:13,141 --> 00:48:14,809
- Then neuralyzed her?
- What?

598
00:48:14,976 --> 00:48:20,356
MiB code 773/I-1 clearly states
that all civilian personnel...

599
00:48:21,357 --> 00:48:22,859
Drop that weapon!
No, no, no!

600
00:48:23,026 --> 00:48:24,652
Jay, I'm... I'm sorry.

601
00:48:24,819 --> 00:48:27,906
No, no, I'm fine. It's my fault.
Uh... Uh...

602
00:48:28,072 --> 00:48:30,533
Kay, my partner.
Laura, the witness.

603
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:31,826
Pleasure.

604
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:37,707
Thanks for sending those agents over
to keep an eye on me last night.

605
00:48:37,874 --> 00:48:39,876
MiB procedural code 594-B

606
00:48:40,043 --> 00:48:43,212
states that MiB personnel
shall never be used...

607
00:48:43,379 --> 00:48:48,718
Ben, the Zarthan, was vaporized here.
I assume the perp was over here.

608
00:48:48,885 --> 00:48:50,470
Ben.

609
00:48:50,637 --> 00:48:53,473
Was he 5'7", thinning hair?
You knew him?

610
00:48:53,890 --> 00:48:56,142
Nope. Never seen him before
in my life.

611
00:48:56,309 --> 00:48:59,187
That is a hell of a fish.

612
00:49:01,397 --> 00:49:03,191
Wait a minute.

613
00:49:08,363 --> 00:49:09,739
You left yourself clues?

614
00:49:09,906 --> 00:49:13,993
In case I was deneuralyzed because
my replacement couldn't handle it.

615
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:18,831
If the joker that had got deneuralyzed
hadn't created the situation...

616
00:49:18,998 --> 00:49:20,333
Boys.

617
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:25,129
All right.
You pointing at something.

618
00:49:27,757 --> 00:49:29,133
Okay.

619
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:30,677
Excuse me.

620
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:33,346
The astronaut.

621
00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:36,557
Jay?

622
00:49:37,058 --> 00:49:39,352
Okay, all right. He's pointing...

623
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:41,729
He's like... He like...

624
00:49:44,232 --> 00:49:46,067
Who would stack boxes like this?

625
00:49:46,234 --> 00:49:50,071
A box stacker who's not
stacking boxes. He's leaving clues.

626
00:49:50,238 --> 00:49:51,739
It's an arrow.

627
00:49:55,868 --> 00:49:58,121
Jay?
You're slowing me down, slick.

628
00:49:58,287 --> 00:50:01,916
Whatever we're looking for
is in these cabinets, right here.

629
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:06,421
Anchovy filets in virgin olive oil.

630
00:50:09,924 --> 00:50:12,301
I hope I'm not slowing you down.

631
00:50:12,927 --> 00:50:15,555
Good work, partner. Yeah.

632
00:50:15,722 --> 00:50:18,099
We gotta figure out where it goes.
I know where.

633
00:50:18,266 --> 00:50:23,104
Whoa. No. Not yet.
MiB code 773 clearly says...

634
00:50:23,271 --> 00:50:26,441
I know the code,
but she might be important to me.

635
00:50:27,066 --> 00:50:29,569
To us. Well, for help.
To help us later.

636
00:50:30,236 --> 00:50:32,947
Well, she can't stay here.
They'll be back.

637
00:50:35,616 --> 00:50:39,328
You can stay with friends of mine.
People like you?

638
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:40,621
Kind of.

639
00:50:40,788 --> 00:50:42,373
Jay!

640
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:45,001
Low bridge!
What's going on, man?

641
00:50:45,168 --> 00:50:47,295
Hey, what's happening, fellas?
MiB is code 101.

642
00:50:49,088 --> 00:50:50,465
Bad.
Very bad.

643
00:50:50,631 --> 00:50:54,677
- I need your help. This is Laura.
- Laura!

644
00:50:54,844 --> 00:50:56,471
Easy, easy!

645
00:50:56,637 --> 00:50:57,680
They're worms.

646
00:50:57,847 --> 00:50:59,974
Once you go worm,
that's what you'll yearn.

647
00:51:00,141 --> 00:51:01,142
Yaah.

648
00:51:01,309 --> 00:51:04,645
I've dated worse.

649
00:51:05,188 --> 00:51:07,815
They're suspended
for stealing from duty-free shop.

650
00:51:07,982 --> 00:51:10,777
We were framed.
Zed's wormophobic.

651
00:51:10,943 --> 00:51:12,236
- Kay!
- You're back!

652
00:51:12,403 --> 00:51:15,156
They said you were dead.
We're double-parked.

653
00:51:15,323 --> 00:51:17,200
Laura's very important to me.

654
00:51:17,909 --> 00:51:21,496
To us. To the stuff... Me and
you, man, the stuff we're doing.

655
00:51:22,663 --> 00:51:25,666
Keep an eye on her.
I'll keep both on her.

656
00:51:25,833 --> 00:51:26,834
No problem!

657
00:51:27,585 --> 00:51:28,878
Hey, hey, hey.

658
00:51:29,045 --> 00:51:31,839
Why don't you sit here?
Like you got a shot.

659
00:51:32,006 --> 00:51:33,174
Hey, shut up!

660
00:51:36,344 --> 00:51:39,013
My communicator,
in case you need it.

661
00:51:40,056 --> 00:51:42,517
Ooh. Ha-ha.

662
00:51:42,683 --> 00:51:45,061
Nice move.
Okay. Um...

663
00:51:45,228 --> 00:51:46,771
Oh. Uh...

664
00:51:46,938 --> 00:51:50,191
Just watch out for Neeble.
Which one's Neeble?

665
00:51:50,358 --> 00:51:51,776
Um, he's...

666
00:51:53,194 --> 00:51:55,404
Which one of y'all is Neeble?
Yo, mama!

667
00:51:55,571 --> 00:51:59,784
Ah. Him, right there. It's fine.
Everything's straight. It's safe.

668
00:51:59,951 --> 00:52:01,953
Don't fall asleep.

669
00:52:03,704 --> 00:52:05,373
Twister!

670
00:52:07,375 --> 00:52:12,046
Run over your plan one more time.
I'm struggling with it.

671
00:52:12,213 --> 00:52:16,050
You neuralyzed memory of the
Light but left yourself clues.

672
00:52:16,217 --> 00:52:17,260
Right.

673
00:52:17,426 --> 00:52:22,515
Photo pointing to a key in a pizzeria
which opens a locker at Grand Central.

674
00:52:22,682 --> 00:52:25,810
In the locker, we'll find another clue.
That's the plan.

675
00:52:25,977 --> 00:52:27,311
Ah.

676
00:52:29,188 --> 00:52:32,775
I like to keep my enemies confused.
We all confused, Kay.

677
00:52:35,069 --> 00:52:36,612
Are you gonna slow me down?

678
00:52:36,779 --> 00:52:39,407
Your brain's working on old software.

679
00:52:39,574 --> 00:52:41,784
Why don't you go
grab us some coffee?

680
00:52:41,951 --> 00:52:45,454
Sure. How do you take it? Black?
Couple cubes of kiss my ass?

681
00:52:45,621 --> 00:52:49,041
I don't know what's in there,
so step back.

682
00:52:49,208 --> 00:52:52,670
Kay, for real, man.
Open the damn locker.

683
00:52:57,258 --> 00:52:59,635
Kay! He's back! The light giver!

684
00:52:59,802 --> 00:53:02,305
All hail Kay! All hail Kay!

685
00:53:06,726 --> 00:53:09,562
You are the man who would be
king of the train locker.

686
00:53:09,729 --> 00:53:10,771
Praise Kay!

687
00:53:10,938 --> 00:53:15,735
Oh, good and gentle townfolk
of Locker C-18,

688
00:53:15,902 --> 00:53:19,447
did I leave anything here?
Yes. The timekeeper.

689
00:53:19,614 --> 00:53:22,283
Left to illuminate our streets
and hearts.

690
00:53:22,450 --> 00:53:26,954
- I've been looking everywhere for this.
- Merciful one! The clock tower!

691
00:53:27,121 --> 00:53:29,832
I got y'all, it's cool.
Check this out.

692
00:53:30,124 --> 00:53:33,252
Titanium case.
Waterproof to over 300 meters.

693
00:53:34,003 --> 00:53:36,589
That's banging.
Who are you, stranger?

694
00:53:37,006 --> 00:53:38,633
- Jay.
- Hmm.

695
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:41,260
All hail Jay!
All hail Jay!

696
00:53:43,888 --> 00:53:46,974
Oh, merciful Jay, the keeper of...
Come on.

697
00:53:47,475 --> 00:53:49,644
- Wait! The commandments!
- The tablet!

698
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:52,855
The tablet! The tablet!
The tablet! The tablet!

699
00:53:53,022 --> 00:53:57,068
We have lived by its word, and
peace has reigned throughout our world.

700
00:53:57,235 --> 00:54:00,655
Pass it on to others! So that they too
may be enlightened!

701
00:54:00,821 --> 00:54:02,490
Be kind! Rewind!

702
00:54:02,657 --> 00:54:04,492
Reconcile your past,

703
00:54:04,909 --> 00:54:07,328
in order to move tranquilly
into your future!

704
00:54:07,495 --> 00:54:09,830
Two for one every Wednesday.

705
00:54:09,997 --> 00:54:13,376
Give twice as much as ye receive
on our most sacred of days.

706
00:54:13,668 --> 00:54:14,710
Every Wednesday.

707
00:54:14,877 --> 00:54:18,005
Large adult entertainment
section in the back.

708
00:54:22,093 --> 00:54:23,678
That's just nasty.

709
00:54:24,512 --> 00:54:26,764
What's with the video card?
Don't know.

710
00:54:26,931 --> 00:54:28,432
The watch?
A reminder.

711
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:29,976
Of what?
Can't remember.

712
00:54:30,142 --> 00:54:31,185
Guess.

713
00:54:31,352 --> 00:54:35,106
I guess we have till midnight,
that's 59 minutes to figure it out.

714
00:54:37,525 --> 00:54:41,654
Look. Here's an idea. Let's
stop chasing butt-backwards clues,

715
00:54:41,821 --> 00:54:45,992
get a couple fission carbonizers
and get our headquarters back.

716
00:54:46,158 --> 00:54:48,327
It's all about to make sense, kid.

717
00:54:48,494 --> 00:54:50,246
Is this card valid?

718
00:54:51,872 --> 00:54:55,710
- This card hasn't been used in years.
- I've been away on business.

719
00:54:55,876 --> 00:54:58,212
- Billions of frequent flier miles.
- Try and use them.

720
00:54:58,379 --> 00:55:02,425
I wanted to go to Cambodia. You can
get a lobster dinner for a dollar.

721
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:08,139
The airlines black out holidays.
It's a conspiracy, I'm sure, I mean...

722
00:55:08,306 --> 00:55:11,017
Can you tell us anything
about the account?

723
00:55:11,392 --> 00:55:13,352
You never checked out a tape.

724
00:55:13,519 --> 00:55:16,272
You reserved one once,
but you never picked it up.

725
00:55:17,732 --> 00:55:19,817
Newton.
There's a rat in the toilet.

726
00:55:19,984 --> 00:55:24,238
It's all stopped up. You're
gonna have to pee in the sin...

727
00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:30,411
Still think I'm paranoid?
Yeah.

728
00:55:31,203 --> 00:55:36,667
Gentlemen, my name is Newton. I run the place.
Seen any aliens lately?

729
00:55:36,834 --> 00:55:41,088
You need professional help.
He's getting it. It's not working.

730
00:55:41,255 --> 00:55:43,466
Okay, so, new case, huh?

731
00:55:43,632 --> 00:55:46,093
Episode 27, Light of Zartha.

732
00:55:47,595 --> 00:55:48,929
Got it.

733
00:55:49,555 --> 00:55:53,309
Jarra, it's a sin they've kept
a genius like you locked away.

734
00:55:53,476 --> 00:55:57,438
Their agent Jay caught me siphoning
ozone to sell on the black market.

735
00:55:57,605 --> 00:55:59,565
They're touchy
about global warming.

736
00:55:59,732 --> 00:56:03,277
I need a spacecraft that can travel
300 times the speed of light.

737
00:56:03,444 --> 00:56:05,446
I'll give you
whatever you want.

738
00:56:05,613 --> 00:56:08,115
Give me Jay. We'll call it even.
Groovy.

739
00:56:08,908 --> 00:56:11,369
You've got till midnight.

740
00:56:15,539 --> 00:56:19,126
Gatbot, I got a little
something special for you.

741
00:56:23,631 --> 00:56:26,425
Newton? Newton, is that you?

742
00:56:26,592 --> 00:56:29,095
Yes, Mom, I'm up here
with some friends.

743
00:56:29,261 --> 00:56:30,846
I wanna have your baby.

744
00:56:31,013 --> 00:56:33,140
Would you like some mini-pizza?

745
00:56:34,058 --> 00:56:37,144
You guys want some mini-pizzas?
They're good.

746
00:56:37,311 --> 00:56:40,523
They're like mini-bagels,
with pizza stuff on them.

747
00:56:40,689 --> 00:56:43,484
She'll put
a little fontina cheese on.

748
00:56:43,651 --> 00:56:47,655
She has palsy, so she ends
up putting a lot of cheese on.

749
00:56:52,284 --> 00:56:54,412
No, thanks, we're cool.

750
00:56:54,578 --> 00:56:55,830
All right.

751
00:56:57,581 --> 00:56:58,958
Over here.

752
00:57:03,629 --> 00:57:05,089
- This is it.
- Hm.

753
00:57:05,256 --> 00:57:07,550
Finally some hard evidence.

754
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:11,512
Gentlemen, before I play the tape,
one question:

755
00:57:12,096 --> 00:57:13,848
What's up with anal probing?

756
00:57:14,014 --> 00:57:17,935
Aliens travel billions of light
years just to check out our...

757
00:57:18,102 --> 00:57:20,354
Boy, move.

758
00:57:20,521 --> 00:57:23,441
Okay. Just a question.

759
00:57:24,483 --> 00:57:28,028
<i>Here is one of
their stories that "never happened"</i>

760
00:57:28,195 --> 00:57:31,449
<i>from one of their files
that doesn't exist.</i>

761
00:57:33,492 --> 00:57:38,497
<i>1978. Devastating war of Zartha
had raged on for 50 years.</i>

762
00:57:38,664 --> 00:57:40,416
Hm, looks like Spielberg's work.

763
00:57:40,583 --> 00:57:44,503
<i>But the Zarthans had
a great treasure, the Light of Zartha.</i>

764
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:48,048
<i>A source of
power so awesome, it alone</i>

765
00:57:48,215 --> 00:57:51,802
<i>could mean victory and restoration
for the Zarthans</i>

766
00:57:51,969 --> 00:57:56,390
<i>or complete annihilation, if it
fell into the hands of the Kylothians.</i>

767
00:57:56,557 --> 00:57:58,726
<i>A group of Zarthans
made the journey,</i>

768
00:57:58,893 --> 00:58:00,686
<i>led by the Keeper of the Light...</i>

769
00:58:00,853 --> 00:58:02,313
Lauranna.

770
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:04,857
<i>Princess Lauranna.</i>

771
00:58:05,149 --> 00:58:09,737
<i>Lauranna beseeched the Men in Black
to help her hide the Light on Earth.</i>

772
00:58:09,904 --> 00:58:12,239
<i>But they could not intervene.</i>

773
00:58:12,406 --> 00:58:13,657
No.

774
00:58:14,366 --> 00:58:15,493
It was night.

775
00:58:17,703 --> 00:58:19,121
And it was raining.

776
00:58:19,747 --> 00:58:21,207
<i>You've been very wise.</i>

777
00:58:21,373 --> 00:58:25,920
<i>Kay, please. If Serleena takes
the Light, it's the end of our world.</i>

778
00:58:26,587 --> 00:58:29,924
<i>If we extend protection
for the Light beyond Earth,</i>

779
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:33,427
<i>we put Earth in jeopardy.
We must remain neutral.</i>

780
00:58:33,594 --> 00:58:36,180
- Where is it?
- We're neutral, remember?

781
00:58:36,388 --> 00:58:38,599
If you want it, go get it.

782
00:58:42,811 --> 00:58:44,313
No!

783
00:59:13,467 --> 00:59:15,761
<i>And so never knowing it happened,</i>

784
00:59:15,928 --> 00:59:18,847
<i>the people of Earth
were once again saved</i>

785
00:59:19,014 --> 00:59:21,141
<i>by a secret society of protectors...</i>

786
00:59:23,269 --> 00:59:24,937
I shouldn't have.

787
00:59:25,896 --> 00:59:28,315
You never sent it off the planet.

788
00:59:29,441 --> 00:59:30,859
You hid it here.

789
00:59:32,861 --> 00:59:34,280
The worm guys.

790
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:41,245
Are you one of Newton's
friends from therapy?

791
00:59:41,412 --> 00:59:43,289
Yes, ma'am, I am.
Look here, please.

792
00:59:43,455 --> 00:59:44,623
Would you like some mini-pizz...?

793
00:59:46,792 --> 00:59:47,835
A neuralyz...

794
00:59:49,587 --> 00:59:53,173
Okay, first, get some contact lenses.

795
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:55,634
Joints look like they pick up cable.

796
00:59:55,801 --> 01:00:00,389
Second, take her to Cambodia. Get
her lobster. Pay more than a dollar.

797
01:00:00,556 --> 01:00:03,851
Third, the second y'all get back
from Cambodia,

798
01:00:04,018 --> 01:00:07,062
move your bum ass
out of your mom's house.

799
01:00:07,229 --> 01:00:09,648
- Let's go.
- Boy, you like 40 years old.

800
01:00:09,815 --> 01:00:12,109
Agent Jay?
All right, all right.

801
01:00:12,276 --> 01:00:16,280
Oh. And there ain't no such thing
as aliens or Men in Black.

802
01:00:22,494 --> 01:00:25,706
You wanna go to Cambodia?
Yeah.

803
01:00:27,833 --> 01:00:29,209
Hey, Mom?

804
01:00:29,835 --> 01:00:31,462
Communicator, Jay.

805
01:00:32,838 --> 01:00:35,591
Laura, it's me.
Jay, we're playing Twister.

806
01:00:35,758 --> 01:00:37,551
What's up, Jay?

807
01:00:37,718 --> 01:00:41,013
Quit touching my butt!
I thought it was your face.

808
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:44,224
They're good at this.
They don't have spines.

809
01:00:44,391 --> 01:00:47,353
Oh. They were telling me about
Oprah, from Chicago.

810
01:00:47,519 --> 01:00:51,065
Maybe landed in Chicago. Ha-ha-ha.

811
01:00:51,398 --> 01:00:53,901
- Are you wearing a bracelet?
- Yeah.

812
01:00:54,068 --> 01:00:55,152
Is it glowing?

813
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:03,243
It's never done that before.
We're on our way.

814
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:04,953
Communicator, Frank.

815
01:01:05,245 --> 01:01:07,748
<i>Frank, get down to Level C.
Deactivate lockdown.</i>

816
01:01:07,915 --> 01:01:10,793
<i>We're headed to the worm guys.
We found the Light.</i>

817
01:01:10,959 --> 01:01:12,378
Got it, Jay.

818
01:01:12,544 --> 01:01:13,712
Scrad?

819
01:01:13,879 --> 01:01:15,005
Bitch.

820
01:01:15,172 --> 01:01:17,091
Why didn't you say I love you?

821
01:01:17,257 --> 01:01:21,887
He's a dog. I don't even like him.
No, the girl. You're sweet on her.

822
01:01:22,054 --> 01:01:25,224
That's why you didn't neuralyze her.
You got emotionally involved.

823
01:01:25,391 --> 01:01:29,895
Like you did with Lauranna?
I put the entire planet in danger.

824
01:01:30,062 --> 01:01:33,315
I don't want to see you
making my mistakes.

825
01:01:33,482 --> 01:01:35,067
Whatever, man.

826
01:01:39,446 --> 01:01:40,656
Laura?

827
01:01:44,952 --> 01:01:46,286
Oi.

828
01:01:47,621 --> 01:01:48,664
Damn!

829
01:01:53,544 --> 01:01:55,045
Never stood half a chance.

830
01:01:56,296 --> 01:01:57,381
Oh, boy.

831
01:01:57,840 --> 01:01:59,758
Unh. That's gonna leave a scar.

832
01:02:01,927 --> 01:02:02,970
Where's Laura?

833
01:02:03,137 --> 01:02:05,472
MiB headquarters.
Some dumb two-headed guy.

834
01:02:05,639 --> 01:02:07,057
They got the bracelet.

835
01:02:07,224 --> 01:02:09,977
We got 39 minutes.
You guys, um,

836
01:02:10,144 --> 01:02:12,312
pull yourselves together.

837
01:02:13,063 --> 01:02:14,148
Damn.

838
01:02:15,524 --> 01:02:17,609
Oh, that's feeling better.

839
01:02:17,776 --> 01:02:20,487
- Hey, guys, wait up!
- Let me grab my drink!

840
01:02:20,654 --> 01:02:22,698
Serleena has the bracelet.
Why take Laura?

841
01:02:22,865 --> 01:02:24,032
She also wants me.

842
01:02:24,199 --> 01:02:27,494
What's the book say?
We're off book. I say split some wigs.

843
01:02:27,661 --> 01:02:29,913
We need wig-splitting weapons.
Got them.

844
01:02:35,210 --> 01:02:38,505
<i>Ah. Paw Paw's coming to visit me.
Hello, Paw Paw.</i>

845
01:02:38,672 --> 01:02:41,675
<i>Paw Paw and ZuZu love to see
what's going on in the garden.</i>

846
01:02:41,842 --> 01:02:46,263
Don't worry, folks. I used to live
here. Came to pick up a few things.

847
01:02:50,309 --> 01:02:51,810
Nice place.

848
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:55,522
Hoo-ah.

849
01:02:56,690 --> 01:02:57,858
Hoo-eeh.

850
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:01,195
Yah!

851
01:03:04,281 --> 01:03:05,532
See you.

852
01:03:15,375 --> 01:03:18,170
You did not see a room
full of weapons or four aliens.

853
01:03:18,337 --> 01:03:21,048
You will cherish and love each
other for the rest of your lives.

854
01:03:21,215 --> 01:03:25,219
Which could be the next 28 minutes,
so get to loving and cherishing.

855
01:03:25,385 --> 01:03:28,055
Oh. And she can stay up
as late as she want

856
01:03:28,222 --> 01:03:30,849
and have cookies
and candy and stuff.

857
01:03:41,735 --> 01:03:43,904
<i>Four minutes to launch.</i>

858
01:03:44,071 --> 01:03:46,031
<i>Four minutes to launch.</i>

859
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:50,744
<i>Your ship is ready.</i>
Good. Send it to Kyloth now.

860
01:03:54,122 --> 01:03:55,374
Ready, guys?

861
01:03:55,541 --> 01:03:57,751
Lock and load, baby.

862
01:03:57,918 --> 01:03:59,586
You ready, kid?
Kid?

863
01:03:59,753 --> 01:04:02,756
I saved the world
from a Kreelon invasion.

864
01:04:02,923 --> 01:04:07,094
They're the Backstreet Boys of the universe.
They throw snowballs?

865
01:04:07,886 --> 01:04:09,346
Know what you're doing?

866
01:04:09,513 --> 01:04:12,516
I'm about to attack one
of the most feared aliens

867
01:04:12,683 --> 01:04:15,936
with four worms and a mailman.
Let's make it hot.

868
01:04:16,103 --> 01:04:17,396
No, no, wait!

869
01:04:23,151 --> 01:04:25,445
A code 101 lockdown!

870
01:04:25,612 --> 01:04:29,658
The building gets pressurized.
Nothing in, nothing out. I knew that.

871
01:04:29,825 --> 01:04:31,869
Yeah, you knew.
Front and center, worms!

872
01:04:32,035 --> 01:04:33,328
You got it.

873
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:45,465
It's about time you guys got here.
That lady is causing all kinds of hell.

874
01:05:05,819 --> 01:05:09,072
Yummy. Someone I need to eat.

875
01:05:09,281 --> 01:05:12,951
Get to the launch pad. The bracelet
shows the departure point.

876
01:05:13,118 --> 01:05:15,370
Do not come back for me.
What do you mean?

877
01:05:15,537 --> 01:05:18,248
Do not come back for me.

878
01:05:22,502 --> 01:05:24,671
Worm guys,
give me some cover fire.

879
01:05:24,838 --> 01:05:26,590
Too scared, can't move.

880
01:05:36,266 --> 01:05:37,476
Go!

881
01:05:48,195 --> 01:05:51,114
Limber.
Go to subcontrol panel 7-R-Delta.

882
01:05:51,281 --> 01:05:56,787
Shut off power so they can't take off.
Can't. Too scared.

883
01:05:57,746 --> 01:06:00,374
Oh, that way.
Away from the bullets.

884
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:02,167
No problem. Hoo-ah.

885
01:06:04,169 --> 01:06:05,587
Alley-oop.

886
01:06:16,807 --> 01:06:18,725
Nice to see you again, Kay.

887
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:25,023
<i>3 minutes to launch.</i>
Jay!

888
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:27,401
<i>Three minutes to launch.</i>

889
01:06:27,901 --> 01:06:29,361
Hello, Jay. Long time.

890
01:06:29,528 --> 01:06:32,030
Jarra! What's up, man?
You look great.

891
01:06:32,197 --> 01:06:34,825
What's it been? Five years?
And 42 days.

892
01:06:34,992 --> 01:06:37,494
You count every one
when you're locked away.

893
01:06:37,661 --> 01:06:41,748
You shouldn't have tried to steal
our ozone. Be there in one minute.

894
01:06:42,874 --> 01:06:45,460
Over our dead titanium bodies!

895
01:06:45,627 --> 01:06:47,087
Two minutes.

896
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:55,595
Uh, let's play this one by ear.

897
01:06:58,390 --> 01:07:02,602
I should have vaporized you before.
You really did love Lauranna.

898
01:07:02,769 --> 01:07:04,646
Didn't you, Kay?

899
01:07:04,938 --> 01:07:06,982
You silly little man.

900
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:28,045
Unh! Aah!
Ha-ha.

901
01:07:30,589 --> 01:07:33,884
Ow! Aah!

902
01:07:35,218 --> 01:07:37,304
<i>Two minutes to launch.</i>

903
01:07:39,222 --> 01:07:40,640
Just go, I'll be fine!

904
01:07:41,475 --> 01:07:43,977
What you talking about?
I'm winning.

905
01:07:44,144 --> 01:07:48,148
Jarra, you are under arrest
for being that ugly,

906
01:07:48,315 --> 01:07:51,151
and for making that many copies.
Surrender!

907
01:07:51,318 --> 01:07:52,360
I want him in pieces.

908
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:55,655
Aah! Whoo!

909
01:07:55,864 --> 01:07:58,200
Jarra Jr. is going, going,

910
01:07:58,867 --> 01:08:00,660
gone!

911
01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:15,092
- Rectum.
- Damn near killed him!

912
01:08:16,468 --> 01:08:17,844
Never get tired of that one.

913
01:08:18,011 --> 01:08:19,429
Where do we shut off the power?

914
01:08:19,596 --> 01:08:20,680
I don't know.

915
01:08:26,686 --> 01:08:30,607
- I'm fine. I'll be there in a minute.
- No, he won't.

916
01:08:35,821 --> 01:08:38,156
Uh-huh. Down to one now, Jarra!

917
01:08:48,416 --> 01:08:50,794
<i>Thirty seconds to launch.</i>

918
01:08:58,885 --> 01:09:01,263
<i>Fifteen seconds to launch.</i>

919
01:09:04,182 --> 01:09:06,309
<i>Ten seconds to launch.</i>

920
01:09:06,601 --> 01:09:07,853
<i>Eight.</i>

<i>Seven.</i>

<i>Six.</i>

923
01:09:11,064 --> 01:09:12,399
<i>Five.</i>

924
01:09:12,566 --> 01:09:13,692
<i>Four.</i>

925
01:09:13,859 --> 01:09:15,861
<i>Three. Two.</i>

<i>Launch terminated.</i>

927
01:09:20,157 --> 01:09:23,618
What did you mean, leave you?
Well, he took your gun.

928
01:09:23,785 --> 01:09:26,621
Cracked your head.
Slammed you across the room.

929
01:09:26,788 --> 01:09:30,876
Half the time you were on your back.
Look, that's how I fight.

930
01:09:31,585 --> 01:09:34,045
You've lost, you insignificant speck.

931
01:09:34,212 --> 01:09:37,257
You've wasted 25 years
of my time, and for what?

932
01:09:37,507 --> 01:09:41,553
The total annihilation of Zartha.
All because you went mushy.

933
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:45,932
I'll give you one last chance to
surrender, you slimy invertebrate.

934
01:09:46,099 --> 01:09:49,686
What are you gonna do to stop me?
Not me. Him.

935
01:09:51,730 --> 01:09:54,024
Your flight's been canceled.

936
01:10:00,739 --> 01:10:05,160
Shut down power. Shut down power.
Buttons, buttons. I'm guessing, uh...

937
01:10:05,327 --> 01:10:06,453
Yeah.

938
01:10:08,538 --> 01:10:10,790
- Worms!
- Sorry.

939
01:10:15,879 --> 01:10:18,548
Give me the bracelet.
I'm going with you.

940
01:10:18,715 --> 01:10:21,426
Everybody in the car.
Everybody.

941
01:10:34,606 --> 01:10:37,484
This bracelet is what
everybody's been after?

942
01:10:37,651 --> 01:10:39,361
It's often something small.

943
01:10:39,527 --> 01:10:42,489
It's not the Light.
It tells us the departure point.

944
01:10:42,656 --> 01:10:45,575
What?
If we don't get there in 11 minutes,

945
01:10:45,742 --> 01:10:48,828
that bracelet will go nuclear
and destroy Earth.

946
01:10:48,995 --> 01:10:50,455
What?!

947
01:10:51,039 --> 01:10:52,666
Hello.
Oh.

948
01:10:53,083 --> 01:10:55,168
Wait, Kay, no.
I know what I'm doing.

949
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:11,142
Damn.

950
01:11:12,811 --> 01:11:16,022
Modified to hyper-speed!
Seat belts.

951
01:11:19,401 --> 01:11:20,443
What's that?

952
01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:23,363
At hyper-speed, you have
to use the navigational stalk.

953
01:11:28,285 --> 01:11:32,539
Toggle switches for the ailerons
. Joysticks for the stabilizer and rudder.

954
01:11:32,706 --> 01:11:34,124
Okay.

955
01:11:37,585 --> 01:11:38,670
I just want you to know...

956
01:11:40,046 --> 01:11:41,881
Hold on to that for one second.

957
01:11:45,468 --> 01:11:47,137
Computer, worms.

958
01:11:47,304 --> 01:11:50,471
I said, "Bitch, if you
don't want me to kick your

959
01:11:50,472 --> 01:11:54,019
skinny Zone Diet ass, turn
around and exit the planet."

960
01:11:54,185 --> 01:11:56,354
<i>Frank, where are you?</i>

961
01:11:56,521 --> 01:11:57,981
Main hall, egg display.

962
01:11:58,148 --> 01:12:01,026
We're taking fire.
Kay pushed the red button.

963
01:12:01,192 --> 01:12:04,112
Computer at MiB can destroy
bogey. I'll walk you through it.

964
01:12:07,449 --> 01:12:11,995
Jay? Frank. You were the best darn
partner a Remoolian could ever have.

965
01:12:12,787 --> 01:12:14,080
Godspeed.

966
01:12:15,749 --> 01:12:20,253
Frank? Frank?
Okay, here we go, automatic pilot.

967
01:12:22,505 --> 01:12:25,842
It is not automatic piloting.
He doesn't operate at hyper-speed.

968
01:12:26,009 --> 01:12:30,263
I could use a steering wheel here!
This is what we got.

969
01:12:32,057 --> 01:12:34,976
Didn't you ever have a Game Boy?
What is a Game Boy?

970
01:12:35,143 --> 01:12:37,437
You know what? Move. Move.
Okay.

971
01:12:38,021 --> 01:12:40,357
Oh! Hey, that is not
the navigational stalk!

972
01:12:52,327 --> 01:12:54,329
Okay, straight down.

973
01:12:59,042 --> 01:13:00,460
Idiots.

974
01:13:10,512 --> 01:13:11,805
Subway may not be the best place

975
01:13:11,971 --> 01:13:13,264
to lose her.
Shh.

976
01:13:15,683 --> 01:13:17,143
Where is he?
He?

977
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:18,853
Jeff. Hang on!

978
01:13:21,147 --> 01:13:22,524
Oops.

979
01:13:23,358 --> 01:13:24,484
Teeth.

980
01:13:58,435 --> 01:14:01,438
Running out of time, Kay.
Where is the Light?

981
01:14:02,647 --> 01:14:04,149
Right here.

982
01:14:05,150 --> 01:14:07,360
What?
What, I'm the Light?

983
01:14:08,278 --> 01:14:10,864
No. No way.
You have a planet to save.

984
01:14:11,030 --> 01:14:13,533
You're mistaken. I work at a pizzeria.

985
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:17,662
Two days ago, I was running a post
office. You are who you are.

986
01:14:17,829 --> 01:14:20,915
Laura, you are the Light.

987
01:14:21,082 --> 01:14:24,836
The leader of your people.
Their spirit and their hope.

988
01:14:25,003 --> 01:14:27,714
The power is within you
to save a planet.

989
01:14:27,881 --> 01:14:32,177
I protected you until it was
your time. Your time is now.

990
01:14:36,639 --> 01:14:40,393
You will save a world. You
know things before they happen.

991
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:42,687
I'm a Libra.
You're Zarthan.

992
01:14:42,854 --> 01:14:47,066
When you get sad, it rains.
Lots of people get sad when it rains.

993
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:50,069
It rains because you're sad, baby.

994
01:15:43,289 --> 01:15:44,916
It's not fair.

995
01:15:50,797 --> 01:15:52,465
Never is.

996
01:15:54,217 --> 01:15:55,843
We are who we are,

997
01:15:56,010 --> 01:15:58,513
even if we sometimes forget.

998
01:16:07,939 --> 01:16:10,483
Jeff, I am so not
in the mood for you!

999
01:16:10,650 --> 01:16:12,402
Get back in the subway!
Now!

1000
01:16:18,950 --> 01:16:20,201
That's not good.

1001
01:16:22,078 --> 01:16:24,747
Wait! No! Aah!

1002
01:16:25,039 --> 01:16:26,374
Jay!

1003
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:31,421
I cannot emphasize enough how much
we need you on that transport.

1004
01:16:32,839 --> 01:16:35,133
Laura! You have to go!

1005
01:16:35,550 --> 01:16:36,926
Oh, jeez.

1006
01:16:38,970 --> 01:16:41,764
Go. He's fine.
He does this all the time.

1007
01:16:42,849 --> 01:16:44,100
Nope!

1008
01:16:46,477 --> 01:16:49,355
About to lay the smackdown
on your candy ass.

1009
01:16:49,772 --> 01:16:52,108
Laura! It's your destiny!

1010
01:16:52,358 --> 01:16:54,277
I was talking, Kay! Aah!

1011
01:16:55,778 --> 01:16:57,947
Hey! No biting.

1012
01:16:59,699 --> 01:17:02,076
If you don't go, we all die.

1013
01:17:05,288 --> 01:17:07,874
You're just as beautiful
as your mother.

1014
01:17:14,547 --> 01:17:16,382
Kay? A little help?

1015
01:17:29,228 --> 01:17:30,355
Kay?

1016
01:17:32,190 --> 01:17:34,734
Might I suggest a bigger gun?

1017
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:02,845
Kid?
Yeah.

1018
01:18:03,304 --> 01:18:06,641
Thanks for bringing me back.
No problem.

1019
01:18:07,266 --> 01:18:08,768
Why didn't you tell me?

1020
01:18:08,935 --> 01:18:11,062
Would you have let her go?

1021
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:36,379
So, what's it like on the outside?
Not doing this every day?

1022
01:18:36,546 --> 01:18:37,964
It's nice.

1023
01:18:38,131 --> 01:18:41,968
Sleep late on the weekends.
Watch the Weather Channel.

1024
01:18:45,471 --> 01:18:47,598
I did miss this city.

1025
01:18:48,808 --> 01:18:52,353
So Laura is Princess
Lauranna's daughter.

1026
01:18:54,272 --> 01:18:57,650
Did y'all...?
MiB is a mess. Let's go, kid.

1027
01:18:58,443 --> 01:18:59,652
Let's go?

1028
01:18:59,819 --> 01:19:04,115
Thousands of people in New York
and New Jersey saw our little event.

1029
01:19:04,282 --> 01:19:08,661
Plan needs to be thought out. Plan
needs to be cool. What you...?

1030
01:19:13,332 --> 01:19:15,293
Kid, I'll get you trained yet.

1031
01:19:15,460 --> 01:19:17,003
I want one of those.

1032
01:19:17,170 --> 01:19:18,421
Damn!

1033
01:19:23,259 --> 01:19:24,469
Hey
Hey.

1034
01:19:24,635 --> 01:19:27,054
How you doing?
I'm good, man.

1035
01:19:27,221 --> 01:19:31,768
We've all been there. The girl is
gone and it hurts. Wanna talk'?

1036
01:19:31,934 --> 01:19:33,478
No.
I can help.

1037
01:19:33,644 --> 01:19:34,687
No.

1038
01:19:34,854 --> 01:19:35,855
Still sulking?

1039
01:19:36,022 --> 01:19:37,064
No.
Yeah.

1040
01:19:37,231 --> 01:19:41,486
Hell, you miss her. It happens to all of us.
I knew this hot young thing.

1041
01:19:41,652 --> 01:19:45,239
When our bodies were in the
positions of the Kamasutra...

1042
01:19:45,406 --> 01:19:46,949
Zed!
Ah...

1043
01:19:47,158 --> 01:19:49,035
Come on, man! Damn!

1044
01:19:49,410 --> 01:19:54,040
I'll tell you about dames. They say they want
to be scratched, but they really want is:

1045
01:19:55,541 --> 01:19:56,709
Hey! Frank.

1046
01:19:56,876 --> 01:19:59,587
What? Still sitting shiva?
Want my advice?

1047
01:19:59,754 --> 01:20:01,672
No. No advice.

1048
01:20:01,839 --> 01:20:03,382
No talking.

1049
01:20:04,008 --> 01:20:05,301
Hell, no.

1050
01:20:05,468 --> 01:20:08,137
Fellas, I swear, I'm fine.

1051
01:20:09,096 --> 01:20:11,891
All hail Jay! All hail Jay!

1052
01:20:12,433 --> 01:20:14,227
I brought them
from Grand Central.

1053
01:20:14,393 --> 01:20:16,062
Why put them in my locker?

1054
01:20:16,229 --> 01:20:18,564
I thought it would put things
in perspective.

1055
01:20:18,731 --> 01:20:21,400
It's kind of sad.
We need to let them out.

1056
01:20:21,567 --> 01:20:23,778
They need to know the world
is bigger than that.

1057
01:20:25,112 --> 01:20:26,447
Still a rookie.

1058
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:31,077
Whoa.
