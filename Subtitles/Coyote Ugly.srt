if you would give my tape

and I first moved to New York...

00:09:36,611 --> 00:09:39,546
when I was 21 to be a dancer,
but I broke my big toe.

by this actor who dumped me
to join the Peace Corps.

until I get published?

What-- What does
""Coyote Ugly"" mean?

615

Did you ever wake up sober
after a one night stand...

tois layin' on your arm,
and they're so ugly...

Well, why would you name
your bar after something like that?

- A comic book.

No, it's not just a comic book.
This is the first appearance
of the Punisher.

653

This is the holy grail
of comic books.

What can I say?
I'm a romantic.

You think this
is romantic?

but I think one day...

-you'll be on stage singing
a song about this very night.
- Mmm.

From a Trash Barge.""

Sorry to disappoint you,
but I'm a songwriter, not a singer.

When I get on stage,
I freeze.

What if the fate of the free world
rested on your voice?

667
00:43:32,645 --> 00:43:36,046
Okay. If the fate of the free
world depended on me singing,

668
00:43:36,115 --> 00:43:38,208
maybe.

669
00:43:38,283 --> 00:43:41,150
All I ever really wanted
is to sit in the dark...

00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:44,917
and hear someone great
singing my songs.

671

I wanna be the one
who writes the music.

672
00:43:49,628 --> 00:43:52,859
I remember the first time
my mother played me
"" Bridge Over Troubled Water""...

673

I remember exactly how her hair smelled.
I remember exactly how I felt.

And every time
I hear that song,

677
00:44:07,246 --> 00:44:10,807
I remember exactly
what she was wearing...

678
00:44:10,883 --> 00:44:13,477
and exactly
how her hair smelled...

679

- Well...

way to get my songs heard...

and sing 'em myself.

we do that?

- The shower.

it takes, how many hours
we have to spend in that shower.

- Okay. Before we hit the showers,

a little something about yourself.

this many questions?

where you got all the moves
