00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,265
<i>Between the years
when the oceans drank Atlantis</i>

3
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:53,688
<i>and the rise of the sons of Aryas,
there was an age undreamed of</i>

4
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:57,899
<i>when shining kingdoms
lay spread across the world.</i>

5
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:02,813
<i>Then came the dark empire of Acheron,</i>

6
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:06,491
<i>where cruel Necromancers
sought secrets of resurrection.</i>

7
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:11,038
<i>They crafted a mask from the bones of kings</i>

8
00:01:11,113 --> 00:01:15,084
<i>and awakened its wrath
with the pure blood of their daughters.</i>

9
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:19,372
<i>The mask summoned spirits
of unspeakable evil,</i>

10
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:23,129
<i>giving them power
no mortal men should possess.</i>

11
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:33,719
<i>Acheron enslaved the civilized world.</i>

12
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:40,560
<i>Only the Barbarian tribes
were left to rise up against them.</i>

13
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:45,781
<i>The mask was shattered and Acheron fell.</i>

14
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:53,997
<i>Each tribe kept a single shard</i>

15
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:57,622
<i>so that no man might attempt
to join them back together</i>

16
00:01:57,701 --> 00:02:02,081
<i>and drive the world
once again into chaos and ruin.</i>

17
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:08,379
<i>Their pieces were scattered across the land
and remained hidden for ages.</i>

18
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:16,187
<i>But prophecy spoke of a man who would
some day try to reassemble the mask</i>

19
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:18,480
<i>and rule the world.</i>

20
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:26,113
<i>So came the dawn of Hyborian Age,
a time both bleak and brutal.</i>

21
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:28,945
<i>And so came a child.</i>

22
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:31,611
<i>Born of battle.</i>

23
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:58,600
Fialla!

24
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:06,895
Fialla.

25
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:09,944
Do not speak, my love. Do not speak.

26
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,526
I must see my child before I die.

27
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,493
Name your son.

28
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,163
His name

29
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,328
is Conan.

30
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:18,736
Slow down, Conan!

31
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:36,424
When a Cimmerian feels thirst,
it is the thirst for blood.

32
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:43,643
When he feels cold,
it is the cold edge of steel.

33
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:48,106
But the courage
of the Cimmerian is tempered.

34
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:52,652
He neither fears death
nor rushes foolishly to meet it.

35
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:55,697
But to be a Cimmerian warrior,

36
00:05:55,772 --> 00:06:00,323
you must have both cunning and
balance, as well as speed and strength.

37
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:06,495
Conan.

38
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,713
I gave you chores, boy.

39
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,415
Finished, Father.

40
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:22,842
First to circle the hills
and return the egg unbroken

41
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:25,894
earns the right to fight with the warriors.

42
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,367
Well, by Crom, boy,
what are you waiting for?

43
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:19,549
We go back.

44
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:23,219
Conan!

45
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:11,369
Make way. Make way.

46
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:25,818
Come. Time to forge a blade.

47
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:54,718
This sword we make will be yours one day.

48
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:07,607
But before you wield it,
you must understand it.

49
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,942
The sword must bend or it will break.

50
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,360
It must be tempered.

51
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:28,540
What is most important
when forging a blade, fire or ice?

52
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:29,715
Fire.

53
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:34,341
Ice?

54
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,297
Are you certain?

55
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:52,064
Fire and ice together.

56
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:54,904
This is the mystery of steel.

57
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:15,879
You're still all fire, boy.

58
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:22,723
No. Slow down. Find your footing.

59
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:31,902
Enough!

60
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:47,502
You're not ready for this sword.

61
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:42,214
Fire!

62
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:57,725
Fire!

63
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,377
- Father!
- Conan!

64
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:36,856
Father!

65
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:37,978
Conan!

66
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:39,604
Die!

67
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:43,980
Father!

68
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,473
Barbarian.

69
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:18,352
There's no shame in kneeling before me.

70
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,034
Each of these brave warriors

71
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:34,949
has surrendered, left their lands,
sworn allegiance to me.

72
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:40,124
They do so because
they know one day I will be a god.

73
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:41,913
One day...

74
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:49,053
the other clans of Cimmeria will gather
for vengeance, and then god or no god,

75
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:51,389
you will fall.

76
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,097
You know why I'm here.

77
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:04,401
One piece is missing from the mask.

78
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:08,235
You know its power. Give it to me now...

79
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,744
or die and I'll find it for myself.

80
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:23,170
I prefer death.

81
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:35,425
Oh, my nose!

82
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,320
No!

83
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:11,298
This is your son.

84
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:16,887
I like him.

85
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:58,307
Come here, my daughter.

86
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:07,351
Father, I sense the bone shard is close.

87
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:10,186
Will you find it for me, Marique?

88
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:16,112
Barbarian, your son has courage.

89
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:20,367
But my daughter has talents as well.

90
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,123
Find it, Marique.

91
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:25,493
These Cimmerians, they do not pray.

92
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:27,370
This is their church.

93
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,713
This is what they worship.

94
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,292
It will be here!

95
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:13,917
The shard. She found the bone shard.

96
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,689
Your mother would be proud.

97
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:39,191
- Remo.
- Yeah?

98
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:42,495
Gather the men. Burn everything.

99
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:43,696
But, Zym!

100
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,781
Not the boy. Not yet.

101
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:50,078
Not yet. Look what he did to my face!

102
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:55,800
Now, how do I punish you, huh?

103
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,712
You fear not pain, nor death.

104
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:23,319
Father! No!

105
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:26,496
Father!

106
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,537
No!

107
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:38,334
Worse than death, eh, Cimmerian?

108
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,798
Watching your son die.

109
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:46,600
Because he loves you.

110
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,627
It is complete.

111
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:17,173
Marique, we're halfway there.

112
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:21,043
When we find the pureblood, your mother,

113
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:25,006
my beloved, will return.

114
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:32,062
The mask is complete!

115
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:54,327
Conan, you cannot save me.

116
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,752
Let go of the chain, boy.

117
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:06,597
- I'm not afraid to die!
- Nor I.

118
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,350
I love you, Son.

119
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,110
No! No!

120
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:40,524
Conan left Cimmeria
and wandered the edges of the world,

121
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:43,694
slaying, thieving, surviving,

122
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:50,577
storming the high walls of Venarium
and prowling the dark seas among pirates.

123
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:55,741
But the nameless man who slaughtered
his village and killed his father

124
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,329
remained in shadow.

125
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:18,513
These are common slavers, Conan.
Not the man you seek. Why attack?

126
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:20,643
No man should live in chains.

127
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,967
Fight!

128
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:30,793
Stay and fight,
you pink-bellied motherless goat-lovers!

129
00:28:58,153 --> 00:28:59,826
Go. You're free.

130
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:08,001
Go. Your masters are dead.
You are no longer slaves.

131
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:12,675
But you've taken all our food,
all our weapons.

132
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:14,803
Where would you have us go?

133
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:23,937
Come on.

134
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:25,855
We sail to Messantia.

135
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:45,663
Come on.

136
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,289
Call it.

137
00:29:54,418 --> 00:29:55,920
Come on, old man.

138
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:13,228
I win!

139
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:22,241
I still win.

140
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:31,880
When I first met him,
he was no bigger than you.

141
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:37,260
Just a scrawny little rat
picking pockets in Zamora.

142
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:39,880
Even SO,

143
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:44,848
it was he who stole the Elephant's Heart

144
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:47,224
and slew the sorcerer Yara.

145
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:52,059
Come.

146
00:30:57,731 --> 00:31:00,530
Hey, mama. Need more mead.

147
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:07,119
Who's next?

148
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:21,089
Guards! There. And check there.

149
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:56,589
Hey. Why are they looking for you?

150
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:59,794
No. No, no, no. No, wait.
You don't understand.

151
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:07,226
They'll be happy to take us both to prison
if you don't let go!

152
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,474
Maybe I wanna go to prison.

153
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,352
You take the one in the middle?

154
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:14,433
Me?

155
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:16,439
- You.
- I'll take him.

156
00:32:28,864 --> 00:32:30,161
I am your prisoner.

157
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:40,880
You're calm for somebody
who's about to die.

158
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,302
Move!

159
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:11,414
Where's the captain?

160
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:16,583
The hill ape can speak.
The captain is currently occupied.

161
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:24,090
Don't worry. Everyone can get their chance.

162
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:40,735
Hey!

163
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:47,279
Stop him!

164
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:57,828
Come here!

165
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:04,042
Where is the captain of the guard?

166
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:07,425
His door's sealed from within.
He can only open it for me.

167
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:16,809
Guards! The door!

168
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:21,693
All right.

169
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:26,030
What?

170
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:38,160
Guards! Guards!

171
00:34:57,304 --> 00:34:58,351
You remember me?

172
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,648
Who are you?

173
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:02,518
I'm the one who made you pretty.

174
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:10,192
You can't do this! Do you know who I am?

175
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,595
Where is the man who killed my father?

176
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:33,048
You seek Khalar Zym?

177
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:40,393
Zym. No.

178
00:35:41,348 --> 00:35:44,602
My people were slain by a common bandit,
not a king.

179
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:48,814
He was a bandit then. He's a legend now.
A Shadow Lord.

180
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,568
A Shadow Lord, huh?

181
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,573
Speak. I will not kill you.

182
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,118
You know the Forbidden Forest?

183
00:36:02,202 --> 00:36:05,081
Nothing there but dead bodies
and the animals who feed on them.

184
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:08,963
Even as we speak,
Khalar leads his legions through the mist.

185
00:36:10,377 --> 00:36:11,378
More.

186
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:12,508
Not good enough.

187
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,474
Wait! The forest is large, I know.

188
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:19,723
But as he returns to his stronghold
at Khor Kalba,

189
00:36:19,803 --> 00:36:22,727
he returns by way of the ravine at Shaipur.

190
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:24,353
That's a perfect place for an ambush.

191
00:36:24,808 --> 00:36:26,810
What does Khalar want there?

192
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:31,319
He's with his witch daughter.
They're searching for a young girl.

193
00:36:31,398 --> 00:36:32,570
A pureblood.

194
00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:34,492
Are you leading me into a trap?

195
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:36,535
No. I wouldn't lie to you.

196
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:38,489
He's mad.

197
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:44,040
He's obsessed with Acheronian sorcery.
I hold no loyalty to him.

198
00:36:46,246 --> 00:36:50,752
Well, Northerner,
I've upheld my part of the deal.

199
00:36:57,757 --> 00:36:58,804
No!

200
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,009
Yes.

201
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:07,525
By Mitra, what are you doing?

202
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:12,071
Toasting to our deal.

203
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:25,914
Hey! Northerner!

204
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:27,996
Hey, hey, wait for me!

205
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,048
Oh, god!

206
00:37:31,124 --> 00:37:33,001
Prisoners of Messantia!

207
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:37,051
The key to your freedom
sits in your captain's gut.

208
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:40,976
You gave me your word!
You swore you'd spare my life!

209
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,394
I said I would not kill you.

210
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,639
Free yourselves.

211
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:02,956
Northerner! My name is Ela-Shan.

212
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:06,376
Perhaps you've heard that there is no lock
I cannot break or vault I cannot enter.

213
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:11,251
If you are ever foolish enough
to pursue this man to Khor Kalba,

214
00:38:11,331 --> 00:38:14,084
come see me in Argalon
so I can talk you out of it.

215
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:16,215
Ask anyone you meet there for Ela-Shan!

216
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:35,196
What do you see in my future,
Master Fassir?

217
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:37,490
It is unclear.

218
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,656
I see a journey.

219
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:47,792
A man crossing the sands.

220
00:38:49,536 --> 00:38:50,913
A knight?

221
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:54,591
A warrior.

222
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:58,586
Your paths will merge.

223
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:04,218
He will take you home to your birthplace.

224
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:13,476
Is that all that you see, Master?

225
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:28,375
The pureblood is close.
I can taste her in the air.

226
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:05,287
There'll be rioting in Messantia for days,
thanks to you.

227
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:08,282
Khalar Zym.

228
00:40:09,282 --> 00:40:10,408
What?

229
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:12,493
That's the name of the man
who killed my father.

230
00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:14,375
Zym?

231
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,381
Do you know who that is?

232
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,633
I am told he's the angel of death.

233
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:22,921
I leave tonight to pursue him in Shaipur.

234
00:40:23,004 --> 00:40:26,099
We can sail as far as the bay
near the Shaipur Outpost.

235
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,718
- You can wait for me there.
- Wait?

236
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:32,646
I'm not your sewing maid.
I will go with you.

237
00:40:33,056 --> 00:40:37,027
Not this time, Artus.
This is something I must do alone.

238
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:47,509
Go to the temple. Go! Go!

239
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,558
Protect the master. Go! Go!

240
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:29,134
Tamara, come with me.

241
00:42:40,308 --> 00:42:41,355
Get into the carriage.

242
00:42:41,434 --> 00:42:42,981
No, I want to stay here
and defend our home.

243
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:44,813
For the sake of your people,
you must leave this place

244
00:42:44,896 --> 00:42:46,773
and go to the monks in Hyrkania.
It is your duty.

245
00:42:46,856 --> 00:42:48,824
Do not hesitate and do not waver.

246
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:51,736
I don't want to leave you.

247
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:53,321
Do you trust me, Tamara?

248
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:56,203
Yes. With my life. Everything I have.

249
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:58,626
Then ask no more questions
and do as I say.

250
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:02,084
Go!

251
00:43:03,498 --> 00:43:04,841
Let's go!

252
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:11,510
Let none escape!

253
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:40,080
Zym.

254
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:16,783
Who are you?

255
00:44:26,706 --> 00:44:28,003
Where's Khalar?

256
00:44:30,251 --> 00:44:31,468
Who is Khalar?

257
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:41,395
Hey!

258
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:09,298
Come here!

259
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:53,801
Come on.

260
00:46:49,849 --> 00:46:51,396
Step aside, Northerner.

261
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:53,815
The woman is property of Khalar Zym.

262
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:55,521
She is my property now.

263
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,490
Well, you have no claim to her.

264
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:01,118
No. But I have a claim to you.

265
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:03,241
And what claim is that?

266
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:06,119
Death.

267
00:47:20,004 --> 00:47:21,051
Who are you?

268
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:28,638
When you fight a Cimmerian, even a boy,

269
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,806
you best kill him.

270
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:32,984
I killed hundreds of Cimmerians.

271
00:47:33,059 --> 00:47:35,733
Yes. An entire village.

272
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:42,076
But I did not burn in my father's forge.

273
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:48,120
Run from me and I will tear apart
the mountains to find you.

274
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:50,333
I will follow you to hell.

275
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:03,389
Woman! Come here.

276
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:07,551
I said, come here.

277
00:48:12,515 --> 00:48:16,941
Which one of you is the pureblood?

278
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:25,112
Whoever reveals her, gets to live.

279
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:36,585
And you smell.

280
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:51,896
Are you the one I seek?

281
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:54,440
Could it be you?

282
00:49:11,991 --> 00:49:13,709
None of them are pure.

283
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:33,179
You know who I've come for.

284
00:49:33,262 --> 00:49:35,811
Why suffer for it?

285
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:40,812
None of the ancient bloodline remain.

286
00:49:40,895 --> 00:49:44,991
Well, if this is true,
tell me why have you and these monks

287
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:48,365
chosen to hide here like vermin
for a thousand years?

288
00:49:48,444 --> 00:49:50,788
We live here in peace.

289
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:55,084
We have no riches. We do not make war.

290
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:57,453
We value life.

291
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,372
You value life.

292
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:05,882
Do you forget what happened
in the forests of Ophir?

293
00:50:07,213 --> 00:50:12,310
When all the nations of Hyboria
hunted a woman as if she were an animal?

294
00:50:14,345 --> 00:50:19,101
When both I and my daughter were forced
to watch Maliva, my innocent wife,

295
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:21,902
be lashed to the wheel and set aflame?

296
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:35,116
No. What you value is death.

297
00:50:36,951 --> 00:50:40,751
The monks here had no part in her death.

298
00:50:43,499 --> 00:50:45,422
Where is the pureblood?

299
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:58,977
Not to fear, Father.

300
00:50:59,848 --> 00:51:02,351
He will tell me his secrets.

301
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:04,778
They all tell me their secrets.

302
00:51:07,648 --> 00:51:10,868
Your vain pursuit for
the secrets of Acheron

303
00:51:11,986 --> 00:51:15,240
is a lust for power, not a love of life.

304
00:51:15,823 --> 00:51:18,747
Your innocent wife

305
00:51:18,826 --> 00:51:23,081
sought to enslave all of Hyboria
with her sorcery.

306
00:51:24,248 --> 00:51:26,717
She deserved to burn.

307
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:32,514
You will never rule,

308
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:37,516
and Maliva will never rise again!

309
00:51:39,555 --> 00:51:40,647
Die!

310
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:56,618
My lord!

311
00:51:56,697 --> 00:51:59,701
Remo is searching for
the one that got away.

312
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:03,044
She is the pureblood.

313
00:52:05,581 --> 00:52:07,800
Remo will capture her for me.

314
00:52:22,422 --> 00:52:23,799
Come here!

315
00:52:36,186 --> 00:52:37,438
Get off.

316
00:52:43,443 --> 00:52:44,945
My master said I would meet you.

317
00:52:48,448 --> 00:52:50,701
He said our paths would merge.

318
00:52:55,705 --> 00:52:57,127
You're the one Khalar Zym seeks.

319
00:52:57,874 --> 00:52:59,126
I know nothing about it.

320
00:52:59,626 --> 00:53:00,969
Those were his men chasing you.

321
00:53:01,044 --> 00:53:03,217
They attacked our monastery.

322
00:53:07,509 --> 00:53:10,638
So, will you escort me to Hyrkania?

323
00:53:15,392 --> 00:53:17,110
We will wait for Khalar.

324
00:53:17,185 --> 00:53:19,483
We? There is no we.

325
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,653
I will go to Hyrkania
as my master instructed.

326
00:53:24,609 --> 00:53:27,328
I said, we will wait.

327
00:53:27,404 --> 00:53:30,328
I said, I win go to Hyrkania.

328
00:53:37,455 --> 00:53:38,707
Why must I be tied up?

329
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:40,508
Keep quiet and do as you're told.

330
00:53:41,001 --> 00:53:43,504
What are you going to do with him?

331
00:53:47,299 --> 00:53:49,552
I will wait for him to awaken.

332
00:53:51,011 --> 00:53:52,888
I wanna look him in the eyes
when I kill him.

333
00:53:56,891 --> 00:53:57,938
Do you have a name?

334
00:53:58,685 --> 00:54:01,484
My name is Tamara Amaliat Jorvi Karushan.

335
00:54:04,482 --> 00:54:05,950
And yours is?

336
00:54:06,359 --> 00:54:07,781
Conan.

337
00:54:08,194 --> 00:54:09,195
Conan.

338
00:54:10,530 --> 00:54:11,622
That's it?

339
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:13,537
How many names do I need?

340
00:54:21,666 --> 00:54:24,419
Why would you save me only to tie me up?

341
00:54:29,674 --> 00:54:31,768
Khalar's a hard man to find.

342
00:54:32,469 --> 00:54:35,643
If I possess you, he must come to me.

343
00:54:36,222 --> 00:54:39,351
Possess? I am not your property.

344
00:54:39,434 --> 00:54:40,481
Go to sleep.

345
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:42,187
I take instruction from no man.

346
00:54:43,229 --> 00:54:46,199
I am a monk of the Order of Shaipur.

347
00:54:47,275 --> 00:54:49,653
My people have never been conquered
by anyone the likes of you

348
00:54:49,736 --> 00:54:50,737
and I'm not about to...

349
00:54:51,613 --> 00:54:52,910
Open.

350
00:54:54,866 --> 00:54:55,913
What?

351
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:57,877
Quiet.

352
00:55:13,093 --> 00:55:16,814
Still no word from Remo and his scouts?

353
00:55:18,723 --> 00:55:24,821
They're gone. Remo will bring her here.
He has never disappointed me.

354
00:55:28,733 --> 00:55:31,202
The prize is near, Father.

355
00:55:31,861 --> 00:55:36,037
Soon you will have not only the mask,
but the blood to fill it.

356
00:55:40,078 --> 00:55:44,925
Marique, how your mother
yearned for the sorcery of Acheron.

357
00:55:47,168 --> 00:55:51,344
Imagine the secrets she will bring
back from the realm of the dead.

358
00:55:53,258 --> 00:55:59,186
And imagine how indomitable I will become
when she's once again by my side.

359
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:03,852
Father...

360
00:56:05,228 --> 00:56:08,858
If the girl is lost, or the ritual fails...

361
00:56:10,108 --> 00:56:12,076
It will not fail.

362
00:56:14,821 --> 00:56:16,573
If it does...

363
00:56:16,656 --> 00:56:18,078
It will not!

364
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,458
Your mother will return to me.

365
00:56:24,581 --> 00:56:28,927
My powers are growing inside of me.

366
00:56:30,378 --> 00:56:33,177
My mother's blood flows through me.

367
00:56:34,507 --> 00:56:38,512
I can help you uncover
the secrets of Acheron,

368
00:56:38,928 --> 00:56:40,225
just as she did.

369
00:56:40,305 --> 00:56:43,309
I can have them all kneeling before you,

370
00:56:44,267 --> 00:56:46,861
just as I kneel before you now.

371
00:56:52,192 --> 00:56:55,196
My Marique, you are like your mother.

372
00:56:56,738 --> 00:56:58,866
In so many ways.

373
00:57:07,207 --> 00:57:09,460
But you are not her.

374
00:57:13,546 --> 00:57:15,469
Here. Drink.

375
00:57:22,222 --> 00:57:25,146
The truth this time.
Why does Khalar want you?

376
00:57:25,683 --> 00:57:29,483
I am a simple monk.
I am of no value to a warlord.

377
00:57:29,562 --> 00:57:30,984
She's lying!

378
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:39,077
It's her blood. Her blood is special.
She's last of the bloodline of Acheron.

379
00:57:39,781 --> 00:57:40,828
Wait.

380
00:57:42,158 --> 00:57:43,910
Don't kill him yet.

381
00:57:48,331 --> 00:57:49,457
You are mistaken.

382
00:57:50,667 --> 00:57:52,510
That bloodline ended a thousand years ago.

383
00:57:52,585 --> 00:57:54,337
You lie, whore.

384
00:57:55,255 --> 00:57:57,053
You can kill him now.

385
00:57:57,632 --> 00:57:59,009
No, please.

386
00:58:00,343 --> 00:58:03,722
For her, I can get you a king's ransom.
It is true.

387
00:58:04,430 --> 00:58:08,276
Khalar has been searching
for a pureblood descendant for 20 years.

388
00:58:09,269 --> 00:58:10,521
Then we will wait for Khalar.

389
00:58:10,603 --> 00:58:13,527
No. He will not come this way.

390
00:58:13,606 --> 00:58:16,325
Zym will be camped
in the Shaipur Ravine waiting for me.

391
00:58:17,110 --> 00:58:18,362
I can show you.

392
00:58:18,444 --> 00:58:20,071
Yeah.

393
00:58:23,867 --> 00:58:24,959
Come.

394
00:58:39,007 --> 00:58:40,304
Come on!

395
00:59:03,531 --> 00:59:05,408
You see? I speak the truth.

396
00:59:07,118 --> 00:59:11,339
If you want, he will give your
weight in gold for this woman.

397
00:59:11,831 --> 00:59:16,086
I will arrange everything.
I will deliver the message.

398
00:59:16,711 --> 00:59:18,679
Yes, you will.

399
01:00:02,465 --> 01:00:03,933
Remo returns.

400
01:00:16,145 --> 01:00:18,147
What does it say?

401
01:00:20,817 --> 01:00:24,572
"The Shaipur Outpost at midday."

402
01:00:25,405 --> 01:00:26,998
"Come alone."

403
01:00:33,121 --> 01:00:34,464
It's hers.

404
01:01:26,215 --> 01:01:28,183
You're bold, Northerner.

405
01:01:31,471 --> 01:01:34,475
I admire courage, even when it's foolish.

406
01:01:40,313 --> 01:01:41,405
Your reward.

407
01:01:42,106 --> 01:01:45,030
- I do not want your gold.
- No?

408
01:01:45,485 --> 01:01:46,532
Then what?

409
01:01:48,237 --> 01:01:49,489
I want your head.

410
01:01:50,114 --> 01:01:51,991
Yes, of course you do.

411
01:01:55,328 --> 01:01:56,545
Kill him.

412
01:01:57,330 --> 01:01:59,128
Then bring me the pureblood.

413
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:15,681
Conan!

414
01:05:10,022 --> 01:05:11,114
Come on!

415
01:05:30,876 --> 01:05:32,344
Who are you?

416
01:05:32,753 --> 01:05:35,472
You left me behind to watch my father die.

417
01:05:42,263 --> 01:05:43,560
Cimmerian.

418
01:05:48,019 --> 01:05:51,239
That was your chance, boy.
You won't get another.

419
01:05:55,526 --> 01:05:58,120
Wouldn't your father be ashamed of you?

420
01:06:30,102 --> 01:06:31,149
Yeah.

421
01:07:08,557 --> 01:07:10,025
Come on!

422
01:07:30,955 --> 01:07:32,548
Huh? Boy?

423
01:07:45,261 --> 01:07:46,353
Run!

424
01:07:49,014 --> 01:07:50,015
No!

425
01:07:59,442 --> 01:08:01,490
By Mitra, jump!

426
01:08:43,235 --> 01:08:45,078
I had him.

427
01:08:52,161 --> 01:08:53,834
Artus, I had him.

428
01:08:54,497 --> 01:08:55,794
The gods are cruel.

429
01:08:55,873 --> 01:08:59,628
Blast the gods. This was not their doing.

430
01:09:02,588 --> 01:09:04,431
It was I who failed.

431
01:09:05,591 --> 01:09:08,219
Are the tales they tell true?

432
01:09:08,302 --> 01:09:12,523
Does he have eyes red as fire
and a hide of golden scales?

433
01:09:12,598 --> 01:09:14,100
He is just a man.

434
01:09:14,517 --> 01:09:17,361
Then it is he who has failed.

435
01:09:17,436 --> 01:09:23,785
In fact, you may be the only man in Hyboria
to fight Khalar Zym and live.

436
01:09:23,859 --> 01:09:25,577
I need to go ashore and find him.

437
01:09:29,114 --> 01:09:31,913
After I go,
you must take her some place safe.

438
01:09:34,036 --> 01:09:35,663
She saved my life.

439
01:09:37,706 --> 01:09:39,083
For that, she has my loyalty.

440
01:09:39,166 --> 01:09:42,170
Then she has mine as well.

441
01:10:02,106 --> 01:10:03,574
Charming man, your friend.

442
01:10:03,649 --> 01:10:06,493
Most men are born to mother's milk.

443
01:10:06,569 --> 01:10:09,618
His first taste was of his mother's blood.

444
01:10:09,697 --> 01:10:11,495
He was battle born.

445
01:10:13,033 --> 01:10:14,410
So all he can do is kill?

446
01:10:14,493 --> 01:10:17,838
Oh, no. He has the heart of a king,

447
01:10:18,414 --> 01:10:20,587
the loyalty of a bloodhound.

448
01:10:21,458 --> 01:10:23,631
The Barbarians may be warriors,

449
01:10:23,711 --> 01:10:27,716
but they do not sacrifice their children
or enslave their allies

450
01:10:27,798 --> 01:10:30,597
like the priests and princes
of the civilized world.

451
01:10:31,844 --> 01:10:33,437
As for his manners...

452
01:10:33,512 --> 01:10:34,729
You look like a harlot.

453
01:10:34,805 --> 01:10:39,026
Yes. And apparently I'm the only woman
you've ever met who isn't one.

454
01:10:44,023 --> 01:10:46,025
Cimmerian women dress as warriors.

455
01:10:47,860 --> 01:10:50,363
Give her the leather and the armor.

456
01:10:51,864 --> 01:10:53,161
I think he likes you.

457
01:11:28,692 --> 01:11:30,911
Wake up! Wake up!

458
01:11:44,750 --> 01:11:46,172
All hands on deck!

459
01:12:02,101 --> 01:12:03,227
No!

460
01:12:46,103 --> 01:12:49,482
How many Cimmerians died
at the edge of that blade?

461
01:12:53,610 --> 01:12:54,862
Catch!

462
01:13:09,334 --> 01:13:11,302
Not bad.

463
01:14:20,572 --> 01:14:22,620
Farewell, good friend.

464
01:14:23,826 --> 01:14:25,578
May you find what you seek, Conan.

465
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:53,610
It would seem our friend has
forgotten his map of the shoreline.

466
01:14:54,189 --> 01:14:55,361
You should take it to him.

467
01:14:56,066 --> 01:14:57,784
And say goodbye.

468
01:15:03,073 --> 01:15:05,121
We set sail at dawn.

469
01:15:05,576 --> 01:15:07,294
Don't be late.

470
01:15:12,124 --> 01:15:14,627
You should go back to the ship.

471
01:15:14,710 --> 01:15:17,259
Do you ever wonder if our actions
serve some plan?

472
01:15:19,006 --> 01:15:22,180
Some purpose spun by the gods?

473
01:15:23,927 --> 01:15:27,306
Or are we all just doomed
to chaos and ruin?

474
01:15:28,765 --> 01:15:30,859
I know not and I care not.

475
01:15:32,102 --> 01:15:37,404
I live, I love, I slay, and I am content.

476
01:16:51,807 --> 01:16:53,059
Goodbye.

477
01:17:38,603 --> 01:17:39,900
Conan!

478
01:18:24,191 --> 01:18:26,694
The elusive one. Welcome.

479
01:18:26,777 --> 01:18:31,829
You have made a mistake.
I am not the person you are looking for.

480
01:18:44,044 --> 01:18:45,170
It is she.

481
01:18:45,837 --> 01:18:49,637
The pureblood descendent
of the Necromancers of Acheron.

482
01:19:40,225 --> 01:19:41,647
I'm looking for a thief.

483
01:19:41,726 --> 01:19:44,570
Argalon is a city of thieves.

484
01:19:45,230 --> 01:19:47,528
I'm looking for a thief named Ela-Shan.

485
01:19:48,150 --> 01:19:51,154
Who are you to ask, Barbarian?

486
01:19:54,364 --> 01:19:55,707
Stand down, you fools!

487
01:20:03,081 --> 01:20:06,085
Fast as Yezud, he will gut you like a fish.

488
01:20:09,921 --> 01:20:12,265
I owe this man my life.

489
01:20:12,966 --> 01:20:15,890
Well, Ela-Shan,
you will have your chance to repay it.

490
01:20:17,929 --> 01:20:19,397
Come.

491
01:20:37,824 --> 01:20:39,076
This is madness.

492
01:20:39,159 --> 01:20:40,706
Breaking into Khalar Zym's fortress

493
01:20:40,785 --> 01:20:43,379
is like reaching under a sleeping dragon
to steal her eggs.

494
01:20:43,455 --> 01:20:45,082
Why go in?

495
01:20:46,041 --> 01:20:48,009
There's a woman inside.

496
01:20:52,088 --> 01:20:54,307
She must be really pretty.

497
01:21:10,774 --> 01:21:15,655
My mother wore this gown
on her wedding day. It flatters you.

498
01:21:18,031 --> 01:21:19,658
I'm not your mother.

499
01:21:20,825 --> 01:21:23,169
No? But you will be.

500
01:21:24,329 --> 01:21:27,583
Imagine that your body is a vessel.

501
01:21:27,666 --> 01:21:29,919
And your soul is the water that fills it.

502
01:21:30,669 --> 01:21:34,890
When your blood seeds the mask,
my father will empty you.

503
01:21:35,715 --> 01:21:37,388
Then I welcome death.

504
01:21:37,467 --> 01:21:41,472
Your death shall herald
a new age of Acheron.

505
01:21:42,806 --> 01:21:46,731
The spirits I raise
will melt flesh from the bones of kings.

506
01:21:46,810 --> 01:21:48,812
And my wife will make me a god,

507
01:21:48,895 --> 01:21:52,775
and we will cast all rivals
into oceans of blood.

508
01:21:59,990 --> 01:22:03,870
Please. I beg you one last time.
Do not do this. Let us turn back.

509
01:22:09,082 --> 01:22:10,174
Come on.

510
01:22:24,014 --> 01:22:28,064
Did you know
I met your Barbarian when he was a boy?

511
01:22:28,518 --> 01:22:30,987
That I took this sword from him?

512
01:22:32,188 --> 01:22:36,159
I'm told Cimmerian steel
is sharper and harder than any other,

513
01:22:37,736 --> 01:22:41,206
that when it cuts,
the pain is close to pleasure.

514
01:22:43,700 --> 01:22:45,919
I know that will please you.

515
01:22:55,295 --> 01:22:57,172
That was the last gate.

516
01:22:57,255 --> 01:23:00,179
I told you, you see?
I told you I can get you in.

517
01:23:48,431 --> 01:23:49,853
You!

518
01:23:52,644 --> 01:23:54,942
A feast for my sword.

519
01:23:55,021 --> 01:23:57,649
No! A feast for the Dweller!

520
01:24:09,327 --> 01:24:10,374
Hey!

521
01:24:18,002 --> 01:24:19,879
- Watch out!
- No! No!

522
01:24:43,194 --> 01:24:44,616
Conan!

523
01:24:44,696 --> 01:24:45,743
Conan, watch out!

524
01:24:57,750 --> 01:25:00,003
No! Hey!

525
01:25:03,465 --> 01:25:04,637
Conan!

526
01:25:24,944 --> 01:25:26,321
Oh, Shit!

527
01:25:30,909 --> 01:25:32,832
- Get me out of here!
- Use a key!

528
01:25:32,911 --> 01:25:35,005
- I can't! I dropped them!
- Then pick the lock!

529
01:25:35,079 --> 01:25:36,251
With what?

530
01:25:44,923 --> 01:25:46,425
Hey! Help me!

531
01:25:48,635 --> 01:25:50,228
Careful! Be careful!

532
01:25:52,764 --> 01:25:53,936
Drop!

533
01:26:07,946 --> 01:26:09,914
Hey! Hey!

534
01:26:18,957 --> 01:26:20,630
Hurry up! Hurry up!

535
01:26:58,746 --> 01:27:01,465
Hey! Help me. Hey!

536
01:27:02,333 --> 01:27:03,459
Get me out of here!

537
01:27:03,543 --> 01:27:05,136
I'm dying! I'm gonna die!

538
01:27:11,342 --> 01:27:12,969
You scream like a woman.

539
01:27:17,015 --> 01:27:19,393
I think it's this way.
Hey, hey, wait for me.

540
01:27:37,035 --> 01:27:40,130
Yeah, I think he's headed to Skull Cave.

541
01:27:40,204 --> 01:27:42,548
I see no more locks down there.

542
01:27:43,666 --> 01:27:45,339
Your debt is paid.

543
01:27:47,795 --> 01:27:49,547
Farewell, my friend.

544
01:27:52,008 --> 01:27:54,887
If you ever need me again,
you know where to find me!

545
01:28:59,992 --> 01:29:04,247
As a victorious Barbarian sword
once shattered the mask,

546
01:29:04,330 --> 01:29:08,005
so shall a vanquished
Barbarian sword revive it.

547
01:30:11,939 --> 01:30:13,111
Pureblood.

548
01:30:30,041 --> 01:30:31,258
Behold

549
01:30:32,835 --> 01:30:34,212
and despair

550
01:30:35,922 --> 01:30:37,549
your new master.

551
01:30:48,559 --> 01:30:50,061
Maliva!

552
01:30:51,020 --> 01:30:52,488
My queen!

553
01:30:53,564 --> 01:30:55,817
Hear my call!

554
01:32:21,819 --> 01:32:23,116
Barbarian.

555
01:32:23,195 --> 01:32:25,197
I don't like you any more.

556
01:32:57,521 --> 01:32:58,864
Jump to the ledge!

557
01:33:02,568 --> 01:33:04,912
Get up! Hide!

558
01:33:17,333 --> 01:33:18,676
That was your chance, Khalar.

559
01:33:18,876 --> 01:33:19,923
And you won't get another.

560
01:33:58,457 --> 01:34:00,175
I smell you.

561
01:34:23,232 --> 01:34:24,449
Conan!

562
01:34:42,835 --> 01:34:44,837
Barbarian!

563
01:34:44,920 --> 01:34:48,800
You're too late. She belongs to me!

564
01:35:45,356 --> 01:35:46,448
Die!

565
01:35:57,576 --> 01:36:00,580
Get out! Tamara, run! Run!

566
01:36:26,063 --> 01:36:31,069
I'm going to kill you
with your own father's blade.

567
01:36:41,662 --> 01:36:43,585
You are not worthy of my father's sword.

568
01:36:53,674 --> 01:36:54,926
Come.

569
01:36:57,303 --> 01:36:59,055
Come on.

570
01:37:18,616 --> 01:37:19,833
Get up.

571
01:37:57,655 --> 01:37:59,248
Go!

572
01:38:01,116 --> 01:38:02,333
Run!

573
01:38:28,018 --> 01:38:32,865
Barbarian! I'm coming for you!

574
01:38:36,819 --> 01:38:37,945
Tamara!

575
01:39:02,886 --> 01:39:04,103
Maliva!

576
01:39:07,224 --> 01:39:09,397
I summon you here.

577
01:39:16,859 --> 01:39:18,281
His witch possesses me.

578
01:39:18,736 --> 01:39:20,158
I can't fight her.

579
01:39:20,237 --> 01:39:21,454
No!

580
01:39:22,614 --> 01:39:24,082
Drop me, Conan, please!

581
01:39:24,867 --> 01:39:30,374
Once again, the little Cimmerian boy
is caught holding a chain.

582
01:39:30,456 --> 01:39:31,799
Let me go!

583
01:39:34,752 --> 01:39:35,878
Let me go!

584
01:39:40,924 --> 01:39:42,016
Boy.

585
01:39:42,092 --> 01:39:44,845
There is no shame in kneeling before me.

586
01:39:46,221 --> 01:39:47,518
Conan, please!

587
01:39:47,598 --> 01:39:49,316
She will live forever.

588
01:39:49,391 --> 01:39:50,984
Drop the chain.

589
01:39:51,810 --> 01:39:53,403
Let go of the chain, Conan.

590
01:39:53,479 --> 01:39:56,449
And let another die in your place?

591
01:39:58,108 --> 01:39:59,701
Like your father?

592
01:40:01,236 --> 01:40:02,328
Drop me!

593
01:40:02,404 --> 01:40:06,659
I warned him that one day

594
01:40:07,368 --> 01:40:09,837
I would become a god.

595
01:40:16,210 --> 01:40:20,465
And my father warned you, god or not...

596
01:40:23,008 --> 01:40:24,009
Let me go!

597
01:40:24,093 --> 01:40:25,185
You will fall!

598
01:40:31,225 --> 01:40:35,401
Maliva!

599
01:40:58,877 --> 01:41:00,754
Give me your hand.

600
01:42:10,908 --> 01:42:12,626
Thank you for bringing me home.

601
01:42:13,160 --> 01:42:14,412
I know you have to leave.

602
01:42:14,495 --> 01:42:15,587
Live well, Tamara.

603
01:42:17,414 --> 01:42:19,212
Till' we meet again.

604
01:43:38,704 --> 01:43:41,503
<i>This sword we make will be yours one day.</i>

605
01:43:42,499 --> 01:43:47,346
<i>But before you wield it,
you must understand it.</i>

606
01:43:48,305 --> 01:44:48,576
