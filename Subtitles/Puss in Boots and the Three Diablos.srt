1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:37,870
In the days following my adventures
with the Golden Goose,

3
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,456
I found myself at a crossroads.

4
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:45,378
Was I destined to be an outlaw -
or a hero?

5
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:47,839
I did not know.

6
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:49,966
Only one thing was certain.

7
00:00:50,134 --> 00:00:53,594
I am Puss In Boots!

8
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:54,762
Whoa!

9
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,514
Are you Puss In Boots?

10
00:00:57,141 --> 00:00:58,141
I am...

11
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:00,184
No.

12
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:09,277
This is outrageous!
What am I charged with, anyway?

13
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:13,322
Because I'm pretty sure
you got the wrong gato.

14
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:19,245
Presenting Princess
Alessandra Bellagamba!

15
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,458
Your Majesty,
I throw myself upon your mercy.

16
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:24,667
¡Silencio!

17
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:27,587
My Heart has been stolen.

18
00:01:27,755 --> 00:01:31,007
I am innocent.
I've never seen you before in my life.

19
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:34,385
No, Signore Boots.

20
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:37,346
The Heart of Fire ruby is missing.

21
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:40,266
It is the crown jewel of my kingdom.

22
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:44,812
Now there is only a hole
where the Heart once was.

23
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:49,025
I want to hire you to find the Heart
and bring it back to me.

24
00:01:49,193 --> 00:01:51,402
You want to hire me?

25
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:55,865
Yes. Your reputation is
that of a cat who fears nothing.

26
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:58,576
Yep. This is me.

27
00:01:59,203 --> 00:02:00,536
Back off!

28
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,164
So, tell me more.

29
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:06,918
The Heart was stolen
by the notorious French thief,

30
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:09,796
- Le Chuchoteur.
- Le what?

31
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:14,050
Le Chuchoteur. The Whisperer.

32
00:02:14,218 --> 00:02:16,010
Why are we whispering?

33
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:18,763
That is his name!

34
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:20,598
You must find him.

35
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:22,600
I'll pay you anything.

36
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:25,812
Yeah.

37
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:29,732
Your tears are payment enough.

38
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,485
Grazie! Grazie!

39
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:36,447
Signore Boots, during the robbery

40
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:39,408
we captured three
of The Whisperer's henchmen.

41
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:43,162
They are the only ones who know
the location of his secret hideout,

42
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,414
but they will not talk.

43
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:48,251
I will make them talk.

44
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:54,924
Food.

45
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,467
Water!

46
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:58,761
Toilet paper.

47
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:01,264
I must warn you,

48
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:06,269
these are the most vile and ferocious
mercenaries we have ever encountered.

49
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:10,231
I am Puss In Boots. I fear nothing!

50
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:27,081
Open up!

51
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:39,844
- Is this a joke?
- It's no joke! They are devils.

52
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,806
These guys?

53
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:54,025
Signore, if these diablos help you
find The Whisperer's secret hideout,

54
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:56,527
I will grant them their freedom.

55
00:03:57,696 --> 00:04:00,489
So, kitties, will you help Puss?

56
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:06,829
Princesa, your ruby
is as good as found.

57
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:11,292
You show Uncle Puss
where The Whisperer lives.

58
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,670
Later, we will all
go out for fish sticks!

59
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:22,219
I know you want to play, but...

60
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:23,930
Hey, hey, what are you...?

61
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:25,431
Hey!

62
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:26,599
No!

63
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,026
Wait! Those are mine!

64
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,114
No!

65
00:04:50,374 --> 00:04:52,208
Stop it! ¡Gatos!

66
00:04:56,672 --> 00:04:59,256
This is very bad for my reputation.

67
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:21,445
Pray for mercy... diablos!

68
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:42,758
What?

69
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:52,852
Why did you do that?

70
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,867
No fish sticks for you!

71
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,581
In the morning,
you are going back to jail forever.

72
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:21,464
Think of your mama.
She's going to be very disappointed.

73
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:26,802
You have no mama.

74
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:33,434
I should have known.
You are orphans.

75
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:37,980
Well, little ones, so am I.

76
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:43,986
I know it's hard to grow up
when you don't know who to trust.

77
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:45,780
Believe me.

78
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:49,909
I was betrayed by my very best friend.

79
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:51,368
He was an egg.

80
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,373
He led me down the wrong path...

81
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,876
...just as this Whisperer
has done to you.

82
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:04,256
What you need, pequeños,

83
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,885
is for someone to point you
in the right direction...

84
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,679
...someone like me.

85
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:17,853
And I shall call you Perla,
because you are one of a kind.

86
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:23,067
And you, Gonzalo,
for your scrappy temper.

87
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:25,444
And you will be...

88
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:29,865
...Sir Timoteo Montenegro the Third.

89
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:33,828
Because sometimes
a title is all you need.

90
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:39,917
Now gather around,
for you have much to learn from...

91
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:44,171
...Puss In Boots.

92
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:11,866
And after that,
the vine grew and grew,

93
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:17,413
straight up into the clouds...
to the Land of Giants.

94
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:25,129
And that is all for tonight,
my pequeños.

95
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,443
The secret hideout.

96
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,542
I am The Whisperer.

97
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,295
¿Qué?

98
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,590
I am The...

99
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:13,427
One more time, OK, buddy?

100
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:18,432
- I am The Whisperer.
- You are The Whisperer?

101
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,392
Yes, I am.

102
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,647
Good. I've come to take back
the Heart of Fire ruby.

103
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:26,398
What?

104
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:33,989
You brought him here.
You will pay dearly for betraying me,

105
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:37,493
- you naughty cats.
- You have to get through me first!

106
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:43,499
Run, kittens, and don't look back!

107
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:19,034
Bad kittens.

108
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,705
No!

109
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:28,836
Hang on!

110
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:40,389
Oh, well. That's that.

111
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:41,849
We did it!

112
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:45,769
Now, it is time for fish sticks!

113
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:50,816
Signore Boots, the kingdom thanks you.

114
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:52,276
Reward him.

115
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:57,406
Oh, no, no. This is too much.

116
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:01,160
Hey, you dropped one! Idiota.

117
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:04,705
And I have a gift for you.

118
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:06,749
Your new personal guard.

119
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,918
It's OK. They are much better now.

120
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,923
Thank you.

121
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:18,844
Now, I have to go.

122
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:22,848
Gracias, my little friends,
for you have shown me

123
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:27,936
there is glory, and sometimes gold,
in doing the right thing.

124
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:37,529
And you, Timmy, will definitely
find gold in your litter box.

125
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:44,828
Be good... my kids in boots.

126
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:48,665
Allergies.

127
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:52,836
Arrivederci!

128
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:58,008
I will never forget you, just as I know
you will never forget the name

129
00:11:58,176 --> 00:11:59,635
Puss In...

130
00:12:00,305 --> 00:13:00,739
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
