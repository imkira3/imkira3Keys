2
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:28,960
Look out!

3
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:02,159
Hey! Trying to work here!

4
00:01:03,927 --> 00:01:06,061
Perhaps you could work
a little faster.

5
00:01:06,063 --> 00:01:08,033
Perhaps if you hadn't
tripped the damn alarm.

6
00:01:11,067 --> 00:01:13,135
Pamela, we are out of time.

7
00:01:13,137 --> 00:01:14,636
The police will be here soon.

8
00:01:14,638 --> 00:01:15,873
Or worse...

9
00:01:16,941 --> 00:01:19,141
Batman, I know, I know!

10
00:01:19,143 --> 00:01:20,642
But it's like trying to find

11
00:01:20,644 --> 00:01:23,013
a needle in a... Haystack.

12
00:01:27,984 --> 00:01:29,820
Come on, come on...

13
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:36,161
Bingo.

Subtitles by explosiveskull

15
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:27,906
Nothing was physically stolen.

16
00:03:28,438 --> 00:03:30,104
Obviously.

17
00:03:30,106 --> 00:03:32,173
There was no effort
to minimize collateral.

18
00:03:32,175 --> 00:03:34,008
This was about information.

19
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:35,543
There's no way Poison Ivy

20
00:03:35,545 --> 00:03:37,880
could've accessed
S.T.A.R. Labs' secure data.

21
00:03:37,882 --> 00:03:39,847
Got it.

22
00:03:39,849 --> 00:03:41,382
Here's the file they copied.

23
00:03:41,384 --> 00:03:43,054
Looks like this is the only
thing they cared about.

24
00:03:45,889 --> 00:03:47,288
Oh, no.

25
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:48,823
Holland.

26
00:03:48,825 --> 00:03:50,159
"Holland."

27
00:03:50,161 --> 00:03:52,161
Why does that
sound so familiar?

28
00:03:52,163 --> 00:03:53,331
Be my guest.

29
00:03:59,235 --> 00:04:02,137
Alec Holland was working
on a bio-restorative formula

30
00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:04,273
to turn deserts into forests.

31
00:04:06,342 --> 00:04:10,512
Until a saboteur's bomb
destroyed that dream.

32
00:04:10,514 --> 00:04:13,447
His body engulfed in the
burning experimental compound,

33
00:04:13,449 --> 00:04:15,983
Holland tried to
douse the flames.

34
00:04:15,985 --> 00:04:18,921
The chemicals reacted
with the surrounding bayou.

35
00:04:18,923 --> 00:04:20,492
His entire
physiognomy changed.

36
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,858
Holland was
transformed into...

37
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,526
- Swamp Thing.
- That's it!

38
00:04:25,528 --> 00:04:27,029
That's what attacked me.

39
00:04:27,031 --> 00:04:28,031
Not quite.

40
00:04:30,334 --> 00:04:31,899
This is Jason Woodrue,

41
00:04:31,901 --> 00:04:34,336
aka the Floronic Man.

42
00:04:34,338 --> 00:04:35,904
Terrific.

43
00:04:35,906 --> 00:04:37,841
Poison Ivy teaming up
with Jason Woodrue.

44
00:04:38,509 --> 00:04:40,274
We're in for a ride.

45
00:04:40,276 --> 00:04:42,476
I see two
immediate objectives.

46
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:43,848
If you'll excuse us.

47
00:04:47,418 --> 00:04:50,385
A, figure out what Ivy
and Woodrue were up to...

48
00:04:50,387 --> 00:04:53,288
And B, find out where
the green team is hiding out.

49
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:56,358
I'll take A. I have a hunch
I need to look into.

50
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,459
You take B.

51
00:04:57,461 --> 00:04:58,860
Check previous addresses,

52
00:04:58,862 --> 00:05:00,331
known associates.

53
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:02,266
Oh, crap.

54
00:05:02,966 --> 00:05:04,098
Right.

55
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,368
We need Harley Quinn.

56
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:08,236
Last I heard,
Harley went off the grid

57
00:05:08,238 --> 00:05:09,605
after she got out on parole.

58
00:05:09,607 --> 00:05:11,406
No one's heard a thing since.

59
00:05:11,408 --> 00:05:12,608
Rumor is she's gone straight,

60
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:14,476
but also, just plain gone.

61
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:16,577
No one disappears
without a trace.

62
00:05:16,579 --> 00:05:18,012
Someone knows something.

63
00:05:18,014 --> 00:05:19,581
Someone always does.

64
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:22,053
It's just a matter of
shaking the right tree.

65
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:29,223
Hey, thanks again
for helping us out

66
00:05:29,225 --> 00:05:30,892
with that
League of Assassins thing

67
00:05:30,894 --> 00:05:32,129
in Nanda Parbat.

68
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:36,063
Oof. That Lady Shiva.

69
00:05:36,065 --> 00:05:38,000
Wouldn't say no
to a slice of that pie,

70
00:05:38,002 --> 00:05:39,002
you know what I mean?

71
00:05:43,206 --> 00:05:45,539
So, what can I do for you,
Batman?

72
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:46,574
A lot going on today,

73
00:05:46,576 --> 00:05:48,911
but I can spare a few minutes.

74
00:05:48,913 --> 00:05:51,282
A man was abducted
from his home two days ago.

75
00:05:52,048 --> 00:05:53,450
Harold Goldblum.

76
00:05:55,084 --> 00:05:56,517
Stupid hand.

77
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:58,320
Henderson!

78
00:05:58,322 --> 00:06:00,288
How do you
even know about that?

79
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:02,190
We've got a total
media lockdown.

80
00:06:02,192 --> 00:06:05,459
Let's just say I've got eyes
and ears everywhere, Sarge.

81
00:06:05,461 --> 00:06:07,195
Hacking the
A.R.G.U.S. computer

82
00:06:07,197 --> 00:06:10,065
is a federal crime, Batman.

83
00:06:10,067 --> 00:06:12,300
Goldblum is a former
professor of chemistry

84
00:06:12,302 --> 00:06:14,069
at Metropolis University.

85
00:06:14,071 --> 00:06:15,336
Spent 15 years

86
00:06:15,338 --> 00:06:18,240
heading up GothCorp
Chemicals' R&D division.

87
00:06:18,242 --> 00:06:20,574
Most recently, he's been
working for the NSA,

88
00:06:20,576 --> 00:06:23,144
specializing in
biological warfare.

89
00:06:23,146 --> 00:06:25,346
He was their top mind
in biology,

90
00:06:25,348 --> 00:06:27,082
botany and toxicology.

91
00:06:27,084 --> 00:06:29,120
I need to know
what he was working on.

92
00:06:30,387 --> 00:06:32,320
That'll be all, Henderson.

93
00:06:32,322 --> 00:06:33,358
Right, Sarge.

94
00:06:34,223 --> 00:06:35,024
Big fan.

95
00:06:37,995 --> 00:06:40,962
I'm sorry, Batman,
that's classified.

96
00:06:40,964 --> 00:06:42,497
My hands are tied.

97
00:06:42,499 --> 00:06:45,166
Strange that you would
put it just that way.

98
00:06:45,168 --> 00:06:46,702
Why?

99
00:06:46,704 --> 00:06:48,570
A fringe hacker group
recently accessed information

100
00:06:48,572 --> 00:06:50,738
about key
A.R.G.U.S. employees.

101
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:54,242
Some of them seem to be
engaged in, shall we say...

102
00:06:54,244 --> 00:06:56,547
Questionable
nocturnal activities.

103
00:06:57,548 --> 00:06:59,581
Are you blackmailing me?

104
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,216
I'm explaining
that I can help stop a crime

105
00:07:02,218 --> 00:07:03,588
in exchange
for some information.

106
00:07:05,521 --> 00:07:07,221
Fine.

107
00:07:07,223 --> 00:07:09,156
But for the record,
what Mistress Ilsa does for me

108
00:07:09,158 --> 00:07:11,192
is considered therapy...

109
00:07:11,194 --> 00:07:13,495
In some countries.

110
00:07:13,497 --> 00:07:15,130
It's an odd case.

111
00:07:15,132 --> 00:07:17,399
No ransom demands,
political requests, nothing.

112
00:07:17,401 --> 00:07:19,101
He just vanished.

113
00:07:19,103 --> 00:07:21,036
Whoever took the guy,
they either killed him,

114
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:22,137
or they're keeping him alive

115
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:24,005
for reason or reasons unknown.

116
00:07:24,007 --> 00:07:25,139
Any leads?

117
00:07:25,141 --> 00:07:26,408
Nothing viable.

118
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:28,313
The investigation
is at a dead end.

119
00:07:29,713 --> 00:07:32,279
Goldblum's field of expertise

120
00:07:32,281 --> 00:07:35,550
is man-made,
pandemic terrorist attacks.

121
00:07:35,552 --> 00:07:39,553
Anthrax, Ebola, flesh-eating
bacteria, you know?

122
00:07:39,555 --> 00:07:41,690
Yes, I do.

123
00:07:41,692 --> 00:07:45,560
In fact, he's the world's
leading expert on the subject.

124
00:07:45,562 --> 00:07:48,430
Jesus, the stuff
that guy knows.

125
00:07:48,432 --> 00:07:50,298
I don't mean to be callous,

126
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,170
but a part of me hopes
they just kill them.

127
00:07:59,442 --> 00:08:00,574
No, sorry.

128
00:08:00,576 --> 00:08:01,776
Uh-uh.

129
00:08:01,778 --> 00:08:03,045
Nah, man.

130
00:08:03,047 --> 00:08:04,579
Mmm, no.

131
00:08:04,581 --> 00:08:05,747
Haven't seen her.

132
00:08:05,749 --> 00:08:07,582
I would've liked to.

133
00:08:07,584 --> 00:08:09,483
Dame owes me
three weeks' back rent!

134
00:08:09,485 --> 00:08:12,120
If you find her, you tell her
she can eat my...

135
00:08:12,122 --> 00:08:15,190
She had...

136
00:08:15,192 --> 00:08:17,659
The cutest smile.

137
00:08:17,661 --> 00:08:20,594
Morty,
that was your niece, Irene!

138
00:08:20,596 --> 00:08:23,264
Always saying she looks like
this Harley Quinn,

139
00:08:23,266 --> 00:08:24,800
but I don't see it.

140
00:08:24,802 --> 00:08:28,502
And an adorable tuchus.

141
00:08:28,504 --> 00:08:29,771
Morty!

142
00:08:29,773 --> 00:08:31,106
Hasn't been around.

143
00:08:31,108 --> 00:08:32,507
Afraid not, my son.

144
00:08:32,509 --> 00:08:33,642
<i>Lo siento.</i>

145
00:08:33,644 --> 00:08:35,209
Can I have that picture?

146
00:08:35,211 --> 00:08:37,512
It was at that deli

147
00:08:37,514 --> 00:08:39,347
on 3rd Street.

148
00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:41,686
Morty, that was
two years ago...

149
00:08:42,485 --> 00:08:43,721
In Miami!

150
00:08:47,356 --> 00:08:50,257
I could go for a Reuben myself
about now.

151
00:08:50,259 --> 00:08:51,395
With extra kraut.

152
00:08:54,431 --> 00:08:55,500
Hang on...

153
00:09:26,263 --> 00:09:29,164
Okay, we got
one Power Girl jumbo combo,

154
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:30,464
one Black Canary

155
00:09:30,466 --> 00:09:32,633
leg and thigh, with coleslaw.

156
00:09:32,635 --> 00:09:33,804
Gonna lose
that hand, pudding.

157
00:09:42,211 --> 00:09:44,546
Anything else
for you today, boys?

158
00:09:44,548 --> 00:09:46,848
- Uh, no.
- I'm good.

159
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:49,153
Yeah, me, too. Totally good.

160
00:09:50,888 --> 00:09:53,722
Crazy broad
broke my freaking arm.

161
00:09:53,724 --> 00:09:55,723
Hey Chet, this crazy broad

162
00:09:55,725 --> 00:09:57,128
broke my freaking arm!

163
00:10:02,865 --> 00:10:04,367
Got to be her...

164
00:11:16,673 --> 00:11:18,375
Come on out.
I know you're there.

165
00:11:21,345 --> 00:11:22,944
I got good ears.

166
00:11:22,946 --> 00:11:25,647
Your hearing gets
mighty sharp in Arkham.

167
00:11:25,649 --> 00:11:27,815
Things go bump in the night.

168
00:11:27,817 --> 00:11:29,450
Hi, Harley.

169
00:11:29,452 --> 00:11:30,884
Long time no see.

170
00:11:30,886 --> 00:11:32,422
I'd like to keep it that way.

171
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:35,857
You're a hard girl to find.

172
00:11:35,859 --> 00:11:38,859
Pretty clever,
hiding in plain sight like that.

173
00:11:38,861 --> 00:11:40,362
I have a few questions.

174
00:11:40,364 --> 00:11:41,629
For example,

175
00:11:41,631 --> 00:11:43,700
where can I find
your BFF Poison Ivy?

176
00:11:48,004 --> 00:11:49,704
We need your help.

177
00:11:49,706 --> 00:11:51,539
- Ivy is...
- Save it, honey.

178
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:53,907
I don't mix it up with
the costume crowd anymore.

179
00:11:53,909 --> 00:11:55,844
I turned over a new leaf,
as it were.

180
00:11:55,846 --> 00:11:57,344
Listen,

181
00:11:57,346 --> 00:11:59,314
Ivy's fallen in
with the wrong crowd.

182
00:11:59,316 --> 00:12:01,382
She and Jason Woodrue
are up to something,

183
00:12:01,384 --> 00:12:02,983
and we have to stop them.

184
00:12:02,985 --> 00:12:04,953
They're a lethal combo,
Harley.

185
00:12:04,955 --> 00:12:07,321
Lots of people
could get hurt or killed.

186
00:12:07,323 --> 00:12:09,056
Ivy could get hurt or killed.

187
00:12:09,058 --> 00:12:10,624
Nuh-uh.

188
00:12:10,626 --> 00:12:12,826
I am done with capes
and tights and masks.

189
00:12:12,828 --> 00:12:15,563
Just trying like hell
to lead a normal life.

190
00:12:15,565 --> 00:12:17,699
Really?
Funny that you're not, say

191
00:12:17,701 --> 00:12:19,367
using your
psychiatric training

192
00:12:19,369 --> 00:12:20,768
to make a decent living,

193
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:23,003
instead of dressing up
in skimpy red and black

194
00:12:23,005 --> 00:12:24,939
for a minimum wage, plus tips.

195
00:12:24,941 --> 00:12:27,309
Pretty weird way
to kick a habit.

196
00:12:27,311 --> 00:12:30,377
You've got to be just itching
to get back in the game.

197
00:12:30,379 --> 00:12:34,815
Nice try, but you're
on your own, Nightwig.

198
00:12:34,817 --> 00:12:37,752
You haven't reported to
your parole officer in months.

199
00:12:37,754 --> 00:12:39,421
I should just drag
your crazy ass

200
00:12:39,423 --> 00:12:40,821
back to jail right now.

201
00:12:40,823 --> 00:12:42,523
Oh, yeah?

202
00:12:42,525 --> 00:12:43,590
Just freaking try,

203
00:12:43,592 --> 00:12:44,861
you butt-wipe!

204
00:12:58,642 --> 00:13:00,809
Sorry, kiddo, but you're
getting the payback

205
00:13:00,811 --> 00:13:02,609
for every pinch,
goose and butt-slap

206
00:13:02,611 --> 00:13:04,314
I've gotten
for the last three months.

207
00:13:30,374 --> 00:13:32,107
Give up?

208
00:13:32,109 --> 00:13:33,907
Just when things
are getting interesting?

209
00:13:33,909 --> 00:13:34,944
Fat chance!

210
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:50,360
Whip.

211
00:13:58,668 --> 00:14:00,604
Ready to call it a night,
Harley?

212
00:14:09,812 --> 00:14:12,446
What's so funny, Chuckles?

213
00:14:21,057 --> 00:14:23,690
Some girls like Mace.

214
00:14:23,692 --> 00:14:27,060
I prefer a little
low-grain Joker venom.

215
00:14:27,062 --> 00:14:29,133
Only useful thing
I ever got from that ass-hat.

216
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:39,409
Nighty-night, jerk.

217
00:14:52,589 --> 00:14:54,555
Don't know
what you expect to find.

218
00:14:54,557 --> 00:14:57,093
My best people have been
over this place a dozen times.

219
00:15:02,131 --> 00:15:04,132
No offense
to your best people,

220
00:15:04,134 --> 00:15:05,635
but they're not me.

221
00:15:15,778 --> 00:15:16,880
What is it?

222
00:15:17,746 --> 00:15:19,980
Oh, yay, a leaf.

223
00:15:19,982 --> 00:15:21,882
Kind of like all of these.

224
00:15:21,884 --> 00:15:22,916
No,

225
00:15:22,918 --> 00:15:24,252
not like those.

226
00:15:24,254 --> 00:15:26,119
It's a completely
different phylum

227
00:15:26,121 --> 00:15:28,055
from every other leaf in here.

228
00:15:28,057 --> 00:15:31,258
Great, you're the world's
greatest florist, too.

229
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,727
Look closely.

230
00:15:32,729 --> 00:15:34,665
Have you ever seen
a leaf like this?

231
00:15:35,664 --> 00:15:37,232
Can't say that I have.

232
00:15:37,234 --> 00:15:39,767
That's because
it isn't from our planet.

233
00:15:39,769 --> 00:15:41,605
Not even from our dimension.

234
00:15:42,905 --> 00:15:44,671
Wait, you mean

235
00:15:44,673 --> 00:15:46,074
Jason Woodrue?

236
00:15:46,076 --> 00:15:47,876
That freak was here?

237
00:15:47,878 --> 00:15:49,643
This is bad.

238
00:15:49,645 --> 00:15:51,646
Your forensic people are bad.

239
00:15:51,648 --> 00:15:52,714
This...

240
00:15:52,716 --> 00:15:54,185
Is catastrophic.

241
00:15:55,918 --> 00:15:58,054
Nightwing, this is Batman.
Come in.

242
00:15:58,889 --> 00:16:00,054
Nightwing?

243
00:16:00,056 --> 00:16:01,256
Everything okay?

244
00:16:01,258 --> 00:16:03,657
He should've
reported in by now.

245
00:16:03,659 --> 00:16:05,225
You want me
to send out a search team?

246
00:16:05,227 --> 00:16:06,861
They're the best that...

247
00:16:06,863 --> 00:16:08,695
Well, they're pretty good.

248
00:16:08,697 --> 00:16:09,796
Like I said,

249
00:16:09,798 --> 00:16:11,799
eyes and ears everywhere.

250
00:16:11,801 --> 00:16:12,867
Besides...

251
00:16:12,869 --> 00:16:14,772
Nightwing can handle himself.

252
00:16:19,543 --> 00:16:21,242
I know, I know, freaking stupid.

253
00:16:21,244 --> 00:16:22,911
Bringing him back to my place.

254
00:16:22,913 --> 00:16:24,212
But what was I supposed to do?

255
00:16:24,214 --> 00:16:25,847
I couldn't just let him go.

256
00:16:25,849 --> 00:16:27,848
He knows the secret location
of my hidey-hole.

257
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:30,084
He'd blab to Batman for sure.

258
00:16:30,086 --> 00:16:32,887
Could've just killed him,
dumbass.

259
00:16:32,889 --> 00:16:34,821
Nah,
I'm not a criminal anymore.

260
00:16:34,823 --> 00:16:37,057
Plus, he's kind of
too cute to kill.

261
00:16:37,059 --> 00:16:38,092
And anyway,

262
00:16:38,094 --> 00:16:39,993
maybe I should help out.

263
00:16:39,995 --> 00:16:43,230
Sounds like Ivy could be in
some serious trouble...

264
00:16:43,232 --> 00:16:44,998
Don't bother yelling for help.

265
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,935
This dump is condemned.

266
00:16:46,937 --> 00:16:49,706
Nobody in the whole building
but us, Nightwig.

267
00:16:50,573 --> 00:16:51,708
"Wing."

268
00:16:52,107 --> 00:16:53,840
Eh?

269
00:16:53,842 --> 00:16:56,143
It's Nightwing.

270
00:16:56,145 --> 00:16:57,579
Really?

271
00:16:57,581 --> 00:16:59,113
Guess I was thinking of
that goofy mullet

272
00:16:59,115 --> 00:17:00,982
you used to have.

273
00:17:00,984 --> 00:17:03,017
Yeesh. That was like
a whole decade of bad-hair days.

274
00:17:03,019 --> 00:17:04,819
Sticks and stones, lady.

275
00:17:04,821 --> 00:17:07,588
I've taken trash talk from
bigger criminals than you.

276
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:08,890
"Criminals"?

277
00:17:08,892 --> 00:17:10,691
If you hadn't noticed,
I went straight.

278
00:17:10,693 --> 00:17:12,626
I'm a freaking waitress
already.

279
00:17:12,628 --> 00:17:15,265
Oh, golly, that's right,
I stand corrected.

280
00:17:18,233 --> 00:17:20,000
Check this out, smart guy.

281
00:17:20,002 --> 00:17:22,069
My pile of rejection letters.

282
00:17:22,071 --> 00:17:24,671
Evidently, the Mayo Clinic's
got some dumb policy

283
00:17:24,673 --> 00:17:27,642
of not hiring former
costume super-villains.

284
00:17:27,644 --> 00:17:30,612
Just like every other hospital
in the world.

285
00:17:30,614 --> 00:17:32,313
There are other jobs.

286
00:17:32,315 --> 00:17:34,949
Oh, sure.
I got a ton of offers.

287
00:17:34,951 --> 00:17:36,985
"We got a very
special role for you

288
00:17:36,987 --> 00:17:38,753
"in <i>Bad Girls After Dark."</i>

289
00:17:38,755 --> 00:17:40,153
And you got to love this one.

290
00:17:40,155 --> 00:17:42,724
"A tasteful pictorial
to be shot in Thailand

291
00:17:42,726 --> 00:17:44,161
"for legal reasons."

292
00:17:47,396 --> 00:17:48,895
You say I'm a criminal,

293
00:17:48,897 --> 00:17:50,698
they say I'm a whore.

294
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,037
Well, I'm sick of other people
telling me what I am!

295
00:17:56,038 --> 00:17:57,040
Whatever.

296
00:17:58,008 --> 00:17:59,207
Got to say,

297
00:17:59,209 --> 00:18:01,308
you gave me
a heck of a workout.

298
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:03,311
Got me all sweat-stinky.

299
00:18:03,313 --> 00:18:04,812
Phew!

300
00:18:04,814 --> 00:18:07,047
Definitely could use a shower.

301
00:18:07,049 --> 00:18:09,217
I think better
when I don't reek.

302
00:18:09,219 --> 00:18:10,785
Still got to figure out
what to do

303
00:18:10,787 --> 00:18:11,989
about Nightwig over there.

304
00:18:12,821 --> 00:18:14,721
Hmm, what to wear,

305
00:18:14,723 --> 00:18:16,224
what to wear?

306
00:18:16,226 --> 00:18:17,392
Sucker-punch Harley.

307
00:18:17,394 --> 00:18:18,660
Arctic Harley.

308
00:18:18,662 --> 00:18:20,061
Street-luge Harley.

309
00:18:20,063 --> 00:18:21,362
Roller-babe Harley.

310
00:18:21,364 --> 00:18:22,930
Steampunk Harley.

311
00:18:22,932 --> 00:18:25,199
Goth-Lolita Harley.

312
00:18:25,201 --> 00:18:26,401
Hey, Nightwig,

313
00:18:26,403 --> 00:18:28,105
is it true you
used to be Robin?

314
00:18:28,938 --> 00:18:30,103
Hmph.

315
00:18:30,105 --> 00:18:31,439
Ain't that
a kick in the pants.

316
00:18:31,441 --> 00:18:33,376
Little boy-wonder
all grown up.

317
00:18:37,446 --> 00:18:38,979
Okay, now...

318
00:18:38,981 --> 00:18:41,114
Don't be getting
any funny ideas.

319
00:18:41,116 --> 00:18:42,118
Too late.

320
00:18:43,252 --> 00:18:45,085
It's funny.

321
00:18:45,087 --> 00:18:47,188
I always kind of thought you
and Batman didn't like girls.

322
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:50,224
- Wait, what?
- You know, that book

323
00:18:50,226 --> 00:18:52,893
with the headlights
and the eyeball-gouging,

324
00:18:52,895 --> 00:18:54,862
I had to write a paper on it
back in college.

325
00:18:54,864 --> 00:18:56,096
Got a B-minus.

326
00:18:56,098 --> 00:18:57,364
Look, Harley, I...

327
00:18:57,366 --> 00:18:59,100
Pretty lonely
these last few months,

328
00:18:59,102 --> 00:19:00,701
if you know what I mean.

329
00:19:00,703 --> 00:19:02,870
You don't meet
a lot of likely prospects

330
00:19:02,872 --> 00:19:04,171
at Superbabes.

331
00:19:04,173 --> 00:19:05,907
I'm kind of choosy.

332
00:19:05,909 --> 00:19:07,741
I'm not saying
I don't want to,

333
00:19:07,743 --> 00:19:09,811
'cause that could be nice.

334
00:19:09,813 --> 00:19:12,747
All sorts of wrong, but nice.

335
00:19:12,749 --> 00:19:15,349
Right now, I just really
need to find Poison...

336
00:19:16,419 --> 00:19:17,785
Face it, sugar.

337
00:19:17,787 --> 00:19:19,219
I got something you want,

338
00:19:19,221 --> 00:19:22,323
and you sure as shooting
got something I want.

339
00:19:22,325 --> 00:19:23,990
So, be a good boy,

340
00:19:23,992 --> 00:19:25,892
and maybe, maybe...

341
00:19:25,894 --> 00:19:28,395
Mama will give you a cookie.

342
00:19:28,397 --> 00:19:30,931
The things I do for Gotham.

343
00:19:30,933 --> 00:19:32,970
I'm taking that as a yes.

344
00:19:35,971 --> 00:19:37,407
<i>It's disgusting.</i>

345
00:19:38,374 --> 00:19:39,942
It's an abomination.

346
00:19:41,978 --> 00:19:43,411
You think I like swapping spit

347
00:19:43,413 --> 00:19:45,379
with this geezer
every six hours?

348
00:19:45,381 --> 00:19:47,782
If you've got a better way
to keep him under our control,

349
00:19:47,784 --> 00:19:49,750
I am all ears.

350
00:19:49,752 --> 00:19:51,885
There's always torture.

351
00:19:51,887 --> 00:19:53,821
I don't torture.

352
00:19:53,823 --> 00:19:56,524
The seven-billion meat bags
who infest this world

353
00:19:56,526 --> 00:19:59,392
would probably consider
our plans for them torture.

354
00:19:59,394 --> 00:20:02,529
Or at least
cruel and inhumane.

355
00:20:02,531 --> 00:20:04,766
Our plans
are for the improvement

356
00:20:04,768 --> 00:20:06,267
of every organism on Earth.

357
00:20:06,269 --> 00:20:08,870
The very
definition of humane.

358
00:20:08,872 --> 00:20:10,270
"Humane."

359
00:20:10,272 --> 00:20:13,173
What an ironic word
coined by a species

360
00:20:13,175 --> 00:20:14,776
completely devoid
of compassion

361
00:20:14,778 --> 00:20:16,443
for any other life forms,

362
00:20:16,445 --> 00:20:18,546
or each other,
for that matter.

363
00:20:18,548 --> 00:20:20,782
They all talk
about climate change,

364
00:20:20,784 --> 00:20:23,316
but have they actually
changed anything?

365
00:20:23,318 --> 00:20:25,253
Indeed, they have.

366
00:20:25,255 --> 00:20:28,088
They've doubled
their output of greenhouse gases,

367
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:30,924
increased the rate
of deforestation,

368
00:20:30,926 --> 00:20:32,927
ravaged the planet.

369
00:20:32,929 --> 00:20:34,528
You said it yourself, Pamela,

370
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:36,330
and I quote,

371
00:20:36,332 --> 00:20:39,199
"Humans simply
will not give a crap

372
00:20:39,201 --> 00:20:41,536
"unless we force them to."

373
00:20:41,538 --> 00:20:42,870
Well,

374
00:20:42,872 --> 00:20:44,805
once our virus
is activated,

375
00:20:44,807 --> 00:20:47,307
every single person
on this planet

376
00:20:47,309 --> 00:20:49,376
will have a vested interest...

377
00:20:49,378 --> 00:20:51,280
In going green.

378
00:21:13,001 --> 00:21:15,268
Oh, God, no.
Stop, stop!

379
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:18,072
You stop it!
You're gonna make me pee!

380
00:21:21,544 --> 00:21:22,943
Hey, hey, hey.

381
00:21:31,221 --> 00:21:33,386
Harley Quinn
reporting for duty, sir.

382
00:21:33,388 --> 00:21:34,622
I was...

383
00:21:34,624 --> 00:21:36,393
I was just about to call you.

384
00:21:49,972 --> 00:21:51,138
Meet you at the car.

385
00:21:54,911 --> 00:21:57,111
Did you get what you needed?

386
00:21:57,113 --> 00:21:58,880
Well, yeah...

387
00:21:58,882 --> 00:22:00,547
Ivy's whereabouts, of course,

388
00:22:00,549 --> 00:22:02,283
that's what you meant.

389
00:22:02,285 --> 00:22:03,554
No, not yet.

390
00:22:07,656 --> 00:22:09,859
Like you never made out
with a super-villain.

391
00:22:16,298 --> 00:22:18,665
So, here's how it's
gonna work, dynamic duo.

392
00:22:18,667 --> 00:22:21,168
Nobody knows Ivy
like I know Ivy.

393
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:22,503
Now, I can help you find her,

394
00:22:22,505 --> 00:22:24,305
but you're gonna let me
talk some sense into her

395
00:22:24,307 --> 00:22:25,640
before you come in, swinging.

396
00:22:25,642 --> 00:22:27,475
And then,
when this whole thing is over,

397
00:22:27,477 --> 00:22:28,609
you're gonna put in
a good word

398
00:22:28,611 --> 00:22:30,111
for me with the parole board.

399
00:22:30,113 --> 00:22:32,212
Tell them what a fine,
upstanding citizen I am,

400
00:22:32,214 --> 00:22:33,850
et cetera, et cetera.

401
00:22:34,584 --> 00:22:35,586
Hmm...

402
00:22:36,986 --> 00:22:38,119
No.

403
00:22:38,121 --> 00:22:40,453
What the what? But, I mean...

404
00:22:40,455 --> 00:22:42,489
Aren't you gonna...
Don't you need...

405
00:22:42,491 --> 00:22:45,125
I don't make deals
with psychopaths.

406
00:22:45,127 --> 00:22:46,494
Sociopath!

407
00:22:46,496 --> 00:22:49,697
So-ci-o-path!

408
00:22:49,699 --> 00:22:52,365
Jeez, why does everybody
always get that wrong?

409
00:22:52,367 --> 00:22:54,334
If you aren't willing
to agree to my terms,

410
00:22:54,336 --> 00:22:55,536
why should I help you?

411
00:22:55,538 --> 00:22:57,071
You'll help us,
or the rest of the world

412
00:22:57,073 --> 00:22:58,471
will cease to exist.

413
00:22:58,473 --> 00:23:00,074
As insane as you are,

414
00:23:00,076 --> 00:23:02,343
you enjoy living.

415
00:23:02,345 --> 00:23:03,643
How about
just a little something

416
00:23:03,645 --> 00:23:05,345
to sweeten the deal?

417
00:23:05,347 --> 00:23:08,048
Spa day? Autographed picture
for my little cousin?

418
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:08,884
He's real sick.

419
00:23:11,354 --> 00:23:13,487
Okay, fine, whatever,
you're the boss.

420
00:23:13,489 --> 00:23:15,456
Wait, she's coming with us?

421
00:23:15,458 --> 00:23:17,123
Is that really a good idea?

422
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:18,625
It's not my first choice.

423
00:23:18,627 --> 00:23:21,362
But we can't afford
to let her out of our sight.

424
00:23:21,364 --> 00:23:24,265
She might tip off Ivy
that we're on to her.

425
00:23:24,267 --> 00:23:26,132
Yeah, dangerous loony
over here.

426
00:23:26,134 --> 00:23:28,004
Never know
what she's gonna do.

427
00:23:33,108 --> 00:23:35,375
Here,
there's a little trick to it.

428
00:23:35,377 --> 00:23:38,245
Hey! Watch the hands,
Buster Brown.

429
00:23:38,247 --> 00:23:39,580
Sorry, I was just...

430
00:23:39,582 --> 00:23:41,681
Jeez, 20 minutes
of naughty fun time

431
00:23:41,683 --> 00:23:42,984
and they think they own you.

432
00:23:42,986 --> 00:23:44,617
I wasn't,
I was just trying to...

433
00:23:44,619 --> 00:23:47,220
Look, maybe I'll call you
sometime, okay?

434
00:23:47,222 --> 00:23:49,158
Like when I'm out of batteries
or something.

435
00:23:55,397 --> 00:23:58,132
Based on Goldblum's
area of expertise,

436
00:23:58,134 --> 00:24:00,668
Woodrue and Ivy's
ideological profiles

437
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:02,536
and the S.T.A.R.
Labs break-in,

438
00:24:02,538 --> 00:24:04,705
there's only one conclusion.

439
00:24:04,707 --> 00:24:06,407
They're going to
synthesize the formula

440
00:24:06,409 --> 00:24:08,209
that created Swamp Thing,

441
00:24:08,211 --> 00:24:10,344
convert it into
a fast-spreading virus

442
00:24:10,346 --> 00:24:12,380
and "save the world..."

443
00:24:12,382 --> 00:24:15,349
By turning humanity
into animal-plant hybrids.

444
00:24:15,351 --> 00:24:16,549
What? Ew.

445
00:24:16,551 --> 00:24:18,084
Look, don't get me wrong.

446
00:24:18,086 --> 00:24:19,553
I ain't no racist.

447
00:24:19,555 --> 00:24:22,055
I mean, some of my
best friends are plant people.

448
00:24:22,057 --> 00:24:23,324
Well, on the bright side,

449
00:24:23,326 --> 00:24:25,258
at least they aren't
actually killing anyone.

450
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,626
Perhaps
not intentionally.

451
00:24:26,628 --> 00:24:28,261
Here we go.

452
00:24:28,263 --> 00:24:29,729
It's bad enough
if they succeed

453
00:24:29,731 --> 00:24:31,766
and we all
live as plant people.

454
00:24:31,768 --> 00:24:34,567
But that's not even
the worst-case scenario.

455
00:24:34,569 --> 00:24:36,536
If any part of
their plan is off,

456
00:24:36,538 --> 00:24:37,705
even a slight bit,

457
00:24:37,707 --> 00:24:40,173
within weeks, days maybe...

458
00:24:40,175 --> 00:24:42,745
We could be looking at the
extinction of all life on the planet.

459
00:24:43,378 --> 00:24:44,812
Jeebus.

460
00:24:44,814 --> 00:24:46,279
But wait a minute.

461
00:24:46,281 --> 00:24:48,149
Why do they need
the Holland formula?

462
00:24:48,151 --> 00:24:50,151
Why not just make
the virus from themselves?

463
00:24:50,153 --> 00:24:51,684
It's a shortcut.

464
00:24:51,686 --> 00:24:54,321
Reverse engineering their
own DNA could take years,

465
00:24:54,323 --> 00:24:55,823
maybe decades.

466
00:24:55,825 --> 00:24:58,459
Neither of them was ever
fully human to begin with.

467
00:24:58,461 --> 00:25:00,161
She's a natural mutation.

468
00:25:00,163 --> 00:25:01,327
And he's an exile Dryad

469
00:25:01,329 --> 00:25:02,630
from another dimension.

470
00:25:02,632 --> 00:25:05,699
"Exile Dryad from..."
You shitting me!

471
00:25:05,701 --> 00:25:07,468
We've seen weirder things.

472
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:09,569
Harley, we just
need you to help us find Ivy.

473
00:25:09,571 --> 00:25:12,073
That's all.
We'll handle the rest.

474
00:25:12,075 --> 00:25:13,841
No problem. I know this guy.

475
00:25:13,843 --> 00:25:15,409
One of Ivy's top henchmen,

476
00:25:15,411 --> 00:25:16,477
probably still tight with him.

477
00:25:16,479 --> 00:25:17,812
And he is...
Oh my God!

478
00:25:17,814 --> 00:25:19,279
Stop the car!

479
00:25:19,281 --> 00:25:20,480
- No.
- But it's him!

480
00:25:20,482 --> 00:25:22,085
- Who?
- That guy!

481
00:25:26,088 --> 00:25:28,157
Hey you! Bobby Leibowitz!

482
00:25:29,826 --> 00:25:31,060
Oh crap!

483
00:25:32,127 --> 00:25:33,129
Harley. Wait!

484
00:27:26,875 --> 00:27:27,975
Lousy,

485
00:27:27,977 --> 00:27:29,610
stinking,

486
00:27:29,612 --> 00:27:31,745
stand me up
for senior

487
00:27:31,747 --> 00:27:32,813
prom!

488
00:27:32,815 --> 00:27:33,881
That's enough.

489
00:27:33,883 --> 00:27:35,815
Dumps me for that chick

490
00:27:35,817 --> 00:27:37,450
with the big...

491
00:27:37,452 --> 00:27:39,753
Sorry, she's off her meds.
Won't happen again.

492
00:27:41,691 --> 00:27:42,989
But seriously dude,

493
00:27:42,991 --> 00:27:44,560
sounds like
you kind of had it coming.

494
00:27:45,694 --> 00:27:47,228
...made my mother cry!

495
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:48,832
Was she worth it,
douchebag?

496
00:28:02,744 --> 00:28:04,346
Waited ten years
to get that...

497
00:28:06,348 --> 00:28:07,349
I was just...

498
00:28:09,618 --> 00:28:10,619
But...

499
00:28:12,622 --> 00:28:14,787
He...

500
00:28:14,789 --> 00:28:16,623
Pull a stupid stunt
like that again,

501
00:28:16,625 --> 00:28:18,491
and I'm dumping you off

Is that it?

506
00:28:23,766 --> 00:28:24,931
Newsflash, gruesome.

507
00:28:24,933 --> 00:28:26,667
You ain't my dad!

508
00:28:26,669 --> 00:28:28,501
This isn't a game, Harley.

509
00:28:28,503 --> 00:28:30,571
I need you to stay focused
on the job at hand.

510
00:28:30,573 --> 00:28:32,273
Focus-schmocus.

511
00:28:32,275 --> 00:28:34,040

mega control-freaky on me.

515
00:28:40,816 --> 00:28:42,682
"Do this. Don't do that!

516

520
00:28:50,425 --> 00:28:52,359

523
00:28:56,665 --> 00:28:57,898
You think I'm just

524
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,066
some dizzy airhead
that don't know nothing.

525
00:29:00,068 --> 00:29:01,969
Do you know what I am?

526
00:29:01,971 --> 00:29:04,305
My punishment for
dropping out of med school.

527
00:29:04,307 --> 00:29:05,838
Wrong.

528
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,741
I'm the answer to
all your prayers, pally.

529
00:29:08,743 --> 00:29:10,846
Take the Donnenfeld
Expressway to Bludhaven.

530
00:29:13,449 --> 00:29:15,552
Come on. Trust me this time.

531
00:29:33,836 --> 00:29:37,337
Okay, you really wanna
stop the car this time.

532
00:29:37,339 --> 00:29:39,605
Those Hawkgirl spicy wings

533
00:29:39,607 --> 00:29:41,543

00:29:58,993 --> 00:30:00,861
Ugh!

537
00:30:00,863 --> 00:30:02,499

- It's not so bad.

538
00:30:03,499 --> 00:30:05,602
Smells like discipline.

539
00:30:16,746 --> 00:30:18,644

541
00:30:31,126 --> 00:30:32,593
I'll give you ten bucks

542
00:30:32,595 --> 00:30:33,697

and don't look back.

543
00:30:39,667 --> 00:30:41,535
I know.
It looks like a total dump.

544
00:30:41,537 --> 00:30:44,705

It is a total dump.

652
00:37:52,233 --> 00:37:53,335
<i>The Elongated Man.</i>

653
00:37:54,902 --> 00:37:55,904
<i>Triumph.</i>

654
00:37:57,239 --> 00:37:58,307
<i>Bloodwind.</i>

655
00:37:59,608 --> 00:38:01,508
<i>Or I could just come down</i>

656
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:03,008
<i>myself, give you guys a hand.</i>

657
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:04,376
<i>Not much going on up here and</i>

658
00:38:04,378 --> 00:38:05,912
<i>the Foosball table
is still busted.</i>

659
00:38:05,914 --> 00:38:07,479
That's all right, Booster.

660
00:38:07,481 --> 00:38:09,516
Thanks anyway. We'll make do.

661
00:38:09,518 --> 00:38:11,450
<i>You sure?
'Cause it's no problem.</i>

662
00:38:11,452 --> 00:38:13,385
<i>One of these can
totally cover for me.</i>

663
00:38:13,387 --> 00:38:14,588
Sorry, Booster.

664
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:16,259
Going under
some high-tension wires.

665
00:38:17,425 --> 00:38:18,925
<i>That sounds like paper.</i>

666
00:38:18,927 --> 00:38:19,929
Over and out.

667
00:38:21,262 --> 00:38:24,097
That was too close.

668
00:38:24,099 --> 00:38:25,835
We got any
of them fries left?

669
00:38:30,038 --> 00:38:31,570
You're just
going to feel a bit of

670
00:38:31,572 --> 00:38:33,505
pressure here, little fellow.

671
00:38:33,507 --> 00:38:35,277
Everything's going
to be just fine.

672
00:38:43,284 --> 00:38:44,319
It's working.

673
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:46,151
He's stable!

674
00:38:46,153 --> 00:38:47,420
Oh!

675
00:38:47,422 --> 00:38:49,623
Look how beautiful you are!

676
00:38:49,625 --> 00:38:52,157
Come to Momma, cutie pie.

677
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:53,226
It works.

678
00:38:53,228 --> 00:38:55,095
It works!

679
00:38:55,097 --> 00:38:57,396
This is no
ordinary leafy mouse,

680
00:38:57,398 --> 00:38:59,900
but a harbinger
of the new age.

681
00:38:59,902 --> 00:39:01,668
The dead
grinding factories of man

682
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:05,104
will be replaced by cathedrals
of mighty redwoods.

683
00:39:05,106 --> 00:39:07,240
A verdant green
life-covered Earth

684
00:39:07,242 --> 00:39:09,178
will burst for...

685
00:39:10,144 --> 00:39:12,045
Eww!

686
00:39:12,047 --> 00:39:14,083
Subject response, negative.

687
00:39:14,983 --> 00:39:16,916
Why isn't it working?

688
00:39:16,918 --> 00:39:19,552
He's faking.
He's not even trying!

689
00:39:19,554 --> 00:39:21,688
Your persuasion
kiss has worn off!

690
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:23,490
He's still under my control.

691
00:39:23,492 --> 00:39:25,291
Harold, tell us
what went wrong.

692
00:39:25,293 --> 00:39:28,128
This is an incredibly
complex azeotrope.

693
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:30,329
The virus conversion
of the formula works

694
00:39:30,331 --> 00:39:32,065
perfectly on paper.

695
00:39:32,067 --> 00:39:34,300
There are literally
millions of variables

696
00:39:34,302 --> 00:39:36,304
that could be
corrupting the process.

697
00:39:37,204 --> 00:39:39,972
Take a guess, meat bag!

698
00:39:39,974 --> 00:39:42,474
Well, guessing
is hardly scientific

699
00:39:42,476 --> 00:39:44,945
but I suspect
it may have something

700
00:39:44,947 --> 00:39:47,079
to do with the fact
that we've been using

701
00:39:47,081 --> 00:39:48,648
plain old swamp water from

702
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:51,650
nearby Slaughter Swamp
for our experiments.

703
00:39:51,652 --> 00:39:53,219
No, what we need

704
00:39:53,221 --> 00:39:55,655
is the precise
bio-nutrients and chemicals

705
00:39:55,657 --> 00:39:57,691
from the water
at the exact place

706
00:39:57,693 --> 00:39:59,693
where the Swamp
Thing was created.

707
00:39:59,695 --> 00:40:01,898
The Ween Right
Swamp in Louisiana.

708
00:40:03,164 --> 00:40:05,632
Oh for God's sake.
What a pain in the ass!

709
00:40:05,634 --> 00:40:06,999
No Pamela, no.

710
00:40:07,001 --> 00:40:09,235
It's perfect! Don't you see?

711
00:40:09,237 --> 00:40:12,371
The lagoon feeds directly
into the Gulf of Mexico.

712
00:40:12,373 --> 00:40:13,740
Where the Gulf's
stream currents will

713
00:40:13,742 --> 00:40:16,075
carry the virus
into the greater Atlantic.

714
00:40:16,077 --> 00:40:17,913
And then, the world!

715
00:40:19,114 --> 00:40:21,349
Mother Earth's salvation.

716
00:40:22,083 --> 00:40:23,652
Ground zero!

717
00:40:29,257 --> 00:40:31,291
I said it last time.
Your turn.

718
00:40:31,293 --> 00:40:32,428
It's over, Ivy.

719
00:40:33,195 --> 00:40:34,260
Harley?

720
00:40:34,262 --> 00:40:35,729
Hiya Red.

721
00:40:35,731 --> 00:40:37,664
You're with them?

722
00:40:37,666 --> 00:40:39,264
Oh, Harl!

723
00:40:39,266 --> 00:40:40,733
Come on, Pammy,
what are you doing?

724
00:40:40,735 --> 00:40:43,269
You're really gonna
change us all into plants?

725
00:40:43,271 --> 00:40:45,204
You know I don't
look good in green.

726
00:40:45,206 --> 00:40:47,440
I'm sorry, Harley,
but there's no other way.

727
00:40:47,442 --> 00:40:49,742
Humankind have
had their chance.

728
00:40:49,744 --> 00:40:51,543
And you've had yours!

729
00:41:21,309 --> 00:41:22,511
Oh, gross!

730
00:42:07,188 --> 00:42:08,190
Jason, the work!

731
00:42:14,329 --> 00:42:15,762
Whoa, what's happening?

732
00:42:15,764 --> 00:42:17,800
He's waking up.
I need to keep him hypnotized.

733
00:42:18,699 --> 00:42:20,599
Hmm... No.

734
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:23,639
Occam's Razor.

735
00:42:25,739 --> 00:42:26,773
Red!

736
00:42:26,775 --> 00:42:28,441
You can leave me here, Pammy.

737
00:42:28,443 --> 00:42:31,510
You know my skin. I burn easy.

738
00:42:31,512 --> 00:42:34,179
That idiot meat skate
betrayed you, Pamela.

739
00:42:34,181 --> 00:42:35,315
She's your worst enemy.

740
00:42:35,317 --> 00:42:36,516
Leave her to her fate!

741
00:43:10,418 --> 00:43:11,454
Nightwing?

742
00:43:12,353 --> 00:43:13,355
Nightwing?

743
00:43:16,557 --> 00:43:19,527
Over here!

744
00:43:30,438 --> 00:43:31,771
You okay?

745
00:43:31,773 --> 00:43:33,742
My ears are gonna
be ringing for a week.

746
00:43:34,708 --> 00:43:36,309
But no broken bones.

747
00:43:36,311 --> 00:43:37,409
Ow!

748
00:43:37,411 --> 00:43:38,413
I think.

749
00:43:39,181 --> 00:43:40,182
Where's Harley?

750
00:43:43,184 --> 00:43:45,487
It's okay.
You're gonna be okay.

751
00:43:46,855 --> 00:43:48,621
Just hang in there, Doc.

752
00:43:48,623 --> 00:43:49,856
Look, here's Batman.

753
00:43:49,858 --> 00:43:51,827
He'll fix you right up.
Sure he will.

754
00:43:52,893 --> 00:43:53,895
Don't pull it out.

755
00:43:57,264 --> 00:43:58,266
Lift his head up.

756
00:44:01,335 --> 00:44:03,271
Louisiana!

757
00:44:04,606 --> 00:44:06,305
Don't try to talk.

758
00:44:06,307 --> 00:44:07,340
- It's okay.
- No.

759
00:44:08,943 --> 00:44:10,146
Must...

760
00:44:11,378 --> 00:44:13,882
They need swamp water.

761
00:44:15,217 --> 00:44:16,282
Complete...

762
00:44:17,518 --> 00:44:18,885
...process.

763
00:44:18,887 --> 00:44:20,385
We're losing him.

764
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:22,956
It's okay, Doc.

765
00:44:22,958 --> 00:44:25,724
You did good.
You did real good.

766
00:44:25,726 --> 00:44:27,395
We'll take it from here.

767
00:44:29,797 --> 00:44:31,231
Hey Doc.

768
00:44:31,233 --> 00:44:32,599
When you get to heaven,

769
00:44:32,601 --> 00:44:33,669
you should look up my bubbe.

770
00:44:34,469 --> 00:44:35,635
Fran Quinzel.

771
00:44:35,637 --> 00:44:37,503
She's super nice.

772
00:44:37,505 --> 00:44:39,375
I think you two
would really hit it off.

773
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:26,952
It was wrong.

774
00:45:26,954 --> 00:45:28,987
We shouldn't have left
them there, not in the flames.

775
00:45:28,989 --> 00:45:30,291
- What if she...
- Died?

776
00:45:30,891 --> 00:45:32,025
Good.

777
00:45:32,027 --> 00:45:34,927
She's on the
wrong side of this, Ivy.

778
00:45:34,929 --> 00:45:37,063
Don't tell me
you are getting cold feet.

779
00:45:37,065 --> 00:45:38,267
No, I just...

780
00:45:39,567 --> 00:45:40,568
Never mind.

781
00:45:45,572 --> 00:45:48,307
Safe to say
we are thoroughly screwed.

782
00:45:48,309 --> 00:45:50,443
They're bound to have
all the airports and train stations

783
00:45:50,445 --> 00:45:51,577
covered by now.

784
00:45:51,579 --> 00:45:53,378
And I can maybe
disguise myself

785
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:54,680
and squeak through
the cordon,

786
00:45:54,682 --> 00:45:56,949
but you?

787
00:45:56,951 --> 00:45:59,487
Well, it was a nice dream
while it last...

788
00:46:00,054 --> 00:46:01,621
Is that a yam?

789
00:46:01,623 --> 00:46:04,557
A very special yam, yes.

790
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:06,595
With certain
unique properties.

791
00:46:07,996 --> 00:46:09,996
I removed half
a dozen of these tubers

792
00:46:09,998 --> 00:46:11,664
from Swamp Thing's
corpse a few years ago

793
00:46:11,666 --> 00:46:13,302
while he was
temporarily deceased.

794
00:46:14,402 --> 00:46:16,336
This is my last one.

795
00:46:16,338 --> 00:46:19,307
I've been saving it
for just such an occasion.

796
00:46:21,876 --> 00:46:22,878
Not hungry.

797
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:25,010
Eat.

798
00:46:25,012 --> 00:46:26,014
It's frozen.

799
00:46:27,081 --> 00:46:28,284
Eat!

800
00:46:35,724 --> 00:46:36,725
More!

801
00:46:41,028 --> 00:46:42,128
Ugh!

802
00:46:42,130 --> 00:46:43,599
It tastes awful.

803
00:46:44,532 --> 00:46:45,534
Whoa!

804
00:46:53,507 --> 00:46:54,942
Take my hand.

805
00:47:20,534 --> 00:47:22,168
What the...

806
00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:23,405
Relax.

807
00:47:25,072 --> 00:47:28,574
Concentrate
on our destination.

808
00:47:28,576 --> 00:47:31,079
Become one with the green.

809
00:47:32,447 --> 00:47:35,351
With the green!

810
00:47:42,556 --> 00:47:44,559
Silly me, I almost forgot.

811
00:48:01,141 --> 00:48:03,775
Oh, man, I'm beat.

812
00:48:03,777 --> 00:48:05,446
How are you doing, Nightwig?

813
00:48:09,451 --> 00:48:12,017
Oh, right,
Nightwing, sorry.

814
00:48:12,019 --> 00:48:13,885
It's like that thing
when you can't remember

815
00:48:13,887 --> 00:48:15,688
if it's suppose to be "their"

816
00:48:15,690 --> 00:48:18,458
with E-I-R,
or "they're" with Y-apostrophe-R-E?

817
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:20,693
You know, you got a 50-50
chance to getting it right

818
00:48:20,695 --> 00:48:22,631
but somehow you always
pick the wrong...

819
00:48:25,934 --> 00:48:28,537
Anyhow... Sorry.

820
00:48:32,773 --> 00:48:33,775
Forget it.

821
00:48:36,010 --> 00:48:37,012
Yeah?

822
00:48:37,744 --> 00:48:39,181
So, we're good?

823
00:48:43,485 --> 00:48:44,486
Sure.

824
00:48:55,496 --> 00:48:57,028
The police
are setting up roadblocks.

825
00:48:57,030 --> 00:48:59,898
Covering the airports,
bus terminals, train stations.

826
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:03,168
Sarge Steel is calling in the
FBI and the National Guard.

827
00:49:03,170 --> 00:49:06,037
- What about us?
- We're headed to Louisiana...

828
00:49:06,039 --> 00:49:07,572
Fast.

829
00:49:21,556 --> 00:49:24,523
The GPS coordinates
for the Holland lab are locked in.

830
00:49:24,525 --> 00:49:25,760
Saddle up.

831
00:49:28,530 --> 00:49:29,665
Thanks for your help.

832
00:49:35,536 --> 00:49:38,737
Hey! Now wait just
a goddamn minute.

833
00:49:38,739 --> 00:49:40,572
That's it?
You got what you wanted

834
00:49:40,574 --> 00:49:41,974
and now you just
gonna dump me?

835
00:49:41,976 --> 00:49:43,309
Like Nightwing over here?

836
00:49:43,311 --> 00:49:44,911
Captain Kirk'ing me for info
and then...

837
00:49:44,913 --> 00:49:46,778
"See you later, toots"?

838
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:48,581
Hey, you were the one who...

839
00:49:48,583 --> 00:49:49,782
And I never...

840
00:49:49,784 --> 00:49:51,083
You need me, Batman!

841
00:49:51,085 --> 00:49:53,119
Uh-huh. That's right.

842
00:49:53,121 --> 00:49:54,753
You need me!

843
00:49:54,755 --> 00:49:56,688
You saw how tough
Plant Guy is.

844
00:49:56,690 --> 00:49:59,057
Tossing you guys
around like raggedy dolls.

845
00:49:59,059 --> 00:50:01,561
If he kicked your butts again,
then what?

846
00:50:01,563 --> 00:50:03,896
You think you're gonna be able
to sweet-talk Ivy

847
00:50:03,898 --> 00:50:05,664
into giving up
her diabolical plan?

848
00:50:05,666 --> 00:50:08,099
Huh, Mr. Smoothie?
Because I got to tell you,

849
00:50:08,101 --> 00:50:09,901
your line ain't that great.

850
00:50:09,903 --> 00:50:11,139
- And beside...
- Enough!

851
00:50:12,072 --> 00:50:14,840
I can't trust you.

852
00:50:14,842 --> 00:50:16,275
But I thought...

853
00:50:16,277 --> 00:50:18,077
I mean, we...

854
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:20,979
You are the walking definition
of "loose cannon", Harley.

855
00:50:20,981 --> 00:50:22,213
For all I know,
you might decide

856
00:50:22,215 --> 00:50:23,816
at the last minute
that Ivy's plan

857
00:50:23,818 --> 00:50:26,017
doesn't sound
so cockeyed after all,

858
00:50:26,019 --> 00:50:28,119
because the wind
changed direction.

859
00:50:28,121 --> 00:50:30,222
Or because it's Thursday.

860
00:50:30,224 --> 00:50:31,824
- But...
- I can't risk it.

861
00:50:31,826 --> 00:50:33,258
The stakes are way too high.

862
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:34,927
- But...
- But what?

863
00:50:34,929 --> 00:50:38,863
But I'll never survive
the veggie apocalypse!

864
00:50:38,865 --> 00:50:40,967
Once I begged
my mom for a cat,

865
00:50:40,969 --> 00:50:42,668
but I left the back door open

866
00:50:42,670 --> 00:50:44,269
one day and it ran away.

867
00:50:44,271 --> 00:50:45,871
And then I begged her
for a hamster

868
00:50:45,873 --> 00:50:47,072
and I forgot to feed it

869
00:50:47,074 --> 00:50:49,008
for like a month.

870
00:50:49,010 --> 00:50:51,744
So then, then she said that
maybe I could have a plant

871
00:50:51,746 --> 00:50:54,146
so she got me this
itty-bitty fern

872
00:50:54,148 --> 00:50:56,048
in this cute little yellow pot

873
00:50:56,050 --> 00:50:58,016
and I forgot to...

874
00:50:59,987 --> 00:51:01,920
Water it!

875
00:51:01,922 --> 00:51:03,889
Well, what if I forget

876
00:51:03,891 --> 00:51:06,124
to water myself?

877
00:51:10,632 --> 00:51:12,030
Oh, please, Mr. "Kind of scary

878
00:51:12,032 --> 00:51:13,965
"but actually really nice"
Batman.

879
00:51:13,967 --> 00:51:15,300
Please let me come with you.

880
00:51:15,302 --> 00:51:17,036
I can make Ivy change her mind

881
00:51:17,038 --> 00:51:19,237
and give up her diabolical
plan with Tree Guy.

882
00:51:19,239 --> 00:51:20,740
I know I can!

883
00:51:20,742 --> 00:51:22,008
We're pals.

884
00:51:22,010 --> 00:51:24,342
Yeah, good pals
like Jack and Jill.

885
00:51:24,344 --> 00:51:25,911
Or pork and beans.

886
00:51:25,913 --> 00:51:28,650
Oh please. Please!

887
00:51:34,655 --> 00:51:36,655
You know,
you're always saying,

888
00:51:36,657 --> 00:51:38,159
"Have a contingency plan."

889
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:42,862
So, your plan B

890
00:51:42,864 --> 00:51:44,800
is Harley Quinn.

891
00:51:56,177 --> 00:51:57,713
God, help us.

892
00:52:06,887 --> 00:52:08,420
Probably should
have mentioned...

893
00:52:08,422 --> 00:52:10,822
I sometimes get
a little airsick.

894
00:52:36,983 --> 00:52:38,653
Eh! Eating me alive
out here.

895
00:52:40,855 --> 00:52:42,822
Thank God.
Can I have some of that?

896
00:52:42,824 --> 00:52:44,956
It's concentrated
sulfuric acid.

897
00:52:44,958 --> 00:52:46,858
A super dehydrating agent.

898
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:49,195
All of the crazy crap
you got stuffed into that belt

899
00:52:49,197 --> 00:52:50,996
and you didn't think
to bring bug spray?

900
00:52:50,998 --> 00:52:52,998
To a freaking swamp?

901
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,867
Um...

902
00:52:54,869 --> 00:52:56,171
What are you good for? Huh?

903
00:52:59,306 --> 00:53:02,007
You're probably just low
on Vitamin B.

904
00:53:02,009 --> 00:53:03,275
Never mind!

905
00:53:03,277 --> 00:53:05,414
Some Boy Scout
you turned out to be.

906
00:53:06,347 --> 00:53:07,349
Ow!

907
00:53:17,891 --> 00:53:20,793
I can't see how they could
have gotten here ahead of us.

908
00:53:20,795 --> 00:53:23,028
With the airports and
train stations locked down?

909
00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:24,530
Probably not.

910
00:53:24,532 --> 00:53:26,532
But super-villains do tend
to be very resourceful.

911
00:53:26,534 --> 00:53:27,967
All I know is,

912
00:53:27,969 --> 00:53:29,501
if they are here already

913
00:53:29,503 --> 00:53:31,170
you could bet your tushie
Ivy's turned some of these

914
00:53:31,172 --> 00:53:34,206
bushes and trees into
monster watchdogs.

915
00:53:34,208 --> 00:53:36,311
Like <i>Little Shop of Horrors</i>
on steroids.

916
00:53:37,043 --> 00:53:38,543
No fooling.

917
00:53:38,545 --> 00:53:40,780
One time, she turned my stick
and lollipops stick

918
00:53:40,782 --> 00:53:42,782
into a three-headed
snake twig thingy...

919
00:53:42,784 --> 00:53:46,318
While it was still
in my mouth!

920
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:47,923
I haven't had
a lollipop since.

921
00:53:52,893 --> 00:53:54,526
What?

922
00:53:54,528 --> 00:53:56,262
What you said before.

923
00:53:56,264 --> 00:53:59,197
I keep thinking about
Plant Guy riding on the subway

924
00:53:59,199 --> 00:54:00,865
in a trench coat and hat.

925
00:54:00,867 --> 00:54:03,334
Like some kind of
seven-foot-tall flasher.

926
00:54:03,336 --> 00:54:05,003
All made out of celery.

927
00:54:24,891 --> 00:54:26,925
Guess they're
definitely here then.

928
00:54:42,844 --> 00:54:44,045
They're coming.

929
00:54:45,445 --> 00:54:47,146
I can feel it.

930
00:54:47,148 --> 00:54:48,514
Would you please
stop fidgeting?

931
00:54:48,516 --> 00:54:50,950
I really need to concentrate.

932
00:54:50,952 --> 00:54:51,987
Just hurry.

933
00:54:54,188 --> 00:54:55,521
Almost done.

934
00:54:55,523 --> 00:54:57,225
One last step.

935
00:55:14,541 --> 00:55:16,110
Look out! Ivy trap.

936
00:55:18,411 --> 00:55:19,980
Come on, this way.

937
00:55:30,590 --> 00:55:31,592
Harley!

938
00:55:48,041 --> 00:55:49,543
What are you doing?

939
00:55:51,278 --> 00:55:53,378
Just what you expected
me to do.

940
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:54,612
Sucker.

941
00:55:54,614 --> 00:55:56,417
Because it's Thursday.

942
00:55:57,418 --> 00:55:58,420
Harley.

943
00:55:59,186 --> 00:56:00,385
Hiya, sweetie.

944
00:56:00,387 --> 00:56:02,186
Look, sorry about before.

945
00:56:02,188 --> 00:56:04,555
I had to make these jerks
think I was on their side

946
00:56:04,557 --> 00:56:06,358
so I could bring them here
and wrap them up for you,

947
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:07,992
so you can get on
with your plan.

948
00:56:07,994 --> 00:56:10,396
Nice, huh?

949
00:56:10,398 --> 00:56:12,030
Pammy honey, you got to give
up this crazy plan.

950
00:56:12,032 --> 00:56:13,298
It's really, really nutzoid.

951
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:15,200
Please don't turn us
all into veggie-people.

952
00:56:15,202 --> 00:56:16,267
There's got to be another way.
You're tampering with things

953
00:56:16,269 --> 00:56:18,103
man was never meant to know.

954
00:56:18,105 --> 00:56:20,005
I'm sure I could put in
a good word for you at your trial.

955
00:56:20,007 --> 00:56:21,373
Because after all,
your heart's in the right place

956
00:56:21,375 --> 00:56:23,175
even if you did kill
all those people.

957
00:56:23,177 --> 00:56:24,943
But please give your plan,
Pammy sweetie honey baby.

958
00:56:24,945 --> 00:56:26,311
Please, please, please.
Please, give up your plan.

959
00:56:26,313 --> 00:56:29,213
What? No, Harley,
the Earth is dying.

960
00:56:29,215 --> 00:56:31,249
I am not destroying the world.

961
00:56:31,251 --> 00:56:32,952
I'm saving it.

962
00:56:32,954 --> 00:56:35,621
Saving it from the
takers and the users.

963
00:56:35,623 --> 00:56:37,222
We've been surrounded by

964
00:56:37,224 --> 00:56:39,023
men like that all our lives.

965
00:56:39,025 --> 00:56:40,959
But we can change them,

966
00:56:40,961 --> 00:56:44,162
trim them, shape them
like a good gardener.

967
00:56:44,164 --> 00:56:45,363
I don't wanna do it,

968
00:56:45,365 --> 00:56:46,634
I have to do it.

969
00:56:48,268 --> 00:56:50,371
Well, you can't blame
a girl for trying.

970
00:57:01,114 --> 00:57:03,048
Concentrated weed killer.

971
00:57:03,050 --> 00:57:04,282
I always keep them on hand

972
00:57:04,284 --> 00:57:06,251
since the lollipop incident.

973
00:57:06,253 --> 00:57:08,153
I thought we were friends!

974
00:57:08,155 --> 00:57:09,655
Red, friends don't
let friends

975
00:57:09,657 --> 00:57:12,090
kill seven billion people.

976
00:57:12,092 --> 00:57:13,191
Uh-oh!

977
00:57:58,505 --> 00:58:00,671
You really are
an idiot, Harley.

978
00:58:00,673 --> 00:58:02,173
We could have
changed the world,

979
00:58:02,175 --> 00:58:03,443
but you're too dumb
to see that!

980
00:58:07,313 --> 00:58:08,746
Oh yeah?

981
00:58:08,748 --> 00:58:11,185
Smart enough to take
away your spanking stick.

982
00:58:12,353 --> 00:58:13,688
Pretty cool, huh?

983
00:58:18,592 --> 00:58:20,825
No, that is cool.

984
00:58:20,827 --> 00:58:22,126
You suck.

985
00:59:29,429 --> 00:59:30,729
Seriously, Pammy,

986
00:59:30,731 --> 00:59:33,132
your plan is totally
bat-shit bonkers.

987
00:59:33,134 --> 00:59:35,200
They're killing our world.

988
00:59:35,202 --> 00:59:36,767
What else can I do?

989
00:59:36,769 --> 00:59:39,271
I don't know! Vote Democrat.
Give money to Greenpeace.

990
00:59:39,273 --> 00:59:41,405
That's for saving whales,
moron.

991
00:59:41,407 --> 00:59:43,342
Whatever!

992
00:59:43,344 --> 00:59:45,480
Anything is better than turning
us all into walking brussel sprouts.

993
01:00:38,831 --> 01:00:41,599
I can do this all night.

994
01:00:41,601 --> 01:00:43,270
I don't have
that kind of time.

995
01:00:46,706 --> 01:00:47,708
No fair!

996
01:00:54,748 --> 01:00:55,880
That's it?

997
01:00:55,882 --> 01:00:57,481
The virus?

998
01:00:57,483 --> 01:00:58,485
The solution...

999
01:00:59,485 --> 01:01:01,489
To all the world's problems.

1000
01:01:02,856 --> 01:01:04,690
One way or another.

1001
01:01:04,692 --> 01:01:06,161
What's that's supposed
to mean?

1002
01:01:07,527 --> 01:01:09,394
My God, Pammy.

1003
01:01:09,396 --> 01:01:11,499
You haven't even tested yet,
have you?

1004
01:01:12,432 --> 01:01:14,465
Have you?

1005
01:01:14,467 --> 01:01:16,501
Batman said that if you get
just one teensy weensy thing wrong

1006
01:01:16,503 --> 01:01:19,237
you could wind up
killing everything on the planet.

1007
01:01:19,239 --> 01:01:20,639
Everything, Pammy.

1008
01:01:20,641 --> 01:01:22,644
Plants, people, animals.

1009
01:01:23,510 --> 01:01:24,512
Everything.

1010
01:01:26,646 --> 01:01:27,979
It doesn't matter.

1011
01:01:27,981 --> 01:01:30,552
Earth will die anyway
if I don't act.

1012
01:01:32,518 --> 01:01:35,789
I'm sorry, Harley,
but I have to roll these dice.

1013
01:01:37,391 --> 01:01:39,925
You're gonna make me do it,
aren't you?

1014
01:01:39,927 --> 01:01:43,662
Well, when this is all over
just remember,

1015
01:01:43,664 --> 01:01:45,496
I gave you a chance.

1016
01:01:45,498 --> 01:01:46,965
What are you...

1017
01:01:46,967 --> 01:01:49,800
- No.
- That's right, sweetie.

1018
01:01:49,802 --> 01:01:52,271
The nuclear option.

1019
01:01:52,273 --> 01:01:54,375
You promised me,
you'd never...

1020
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:00,882
Harley, I'm warning you.

1021
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:08,822
Don't you dare!

1022
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:23,238
I hate you so much.

1023
01:02:25,972 --> 01:02:27,805
Works every time.

1024
01:02:27,807 --> 01:02:28,809
Phew!

1025
01:02:32,945 --> 01:02:34,646
Holy crap!

1026
01:02:34,648 --> 01:02:36,351
Pamela, have you...

1027
01:02:39,987 --> 01:02:41,519
So...

1028
01:02:41,521 --> 01:02:44,889
This is where your true
allegiance lies,

1029
01:02:44,891 --> 01:02:46,994
with that cancerous meat.

1030
01:02:47,860 --> 01:02:49,860
We can't do this, Jason.

1031
01:02:49,862 --> 01:02:51,996
If we've made
one miscalculation

1032
01:02:51,998 --> 01:02:54,465
the whole Earth will die.

1033
01:02:54,467 --> 01:02:55,766
A small risk.

1034
01:02:55,768 --> 01:02:57,704
And one I'm more
than willing to take.

1035
01:02:58,505 --> 01:02:59,874
Well, I'm not.

1036
01:03:00,641 --> 01:03:01,643
Pity.

1037
01:03:18,625 --> 01:03:19,893
Get him, Red!

1038
01:04:03,536 --> 01:04:07,942
The plant world belongs to me!

1039
01:04:15,849 --> 01:04:16,884
Red!

1040
01:04:17,650 --> 01:04:18,950
Okay, fugly!

1041
01:04:18,952 --> 01:04:20,952
You just bought yourself
a first-class beating.

1042
01:04:31,498 --> 01:04:32,833
At last,

1043
01:04:34,001 --> 01:04:37,936
humanity's lunatic reign
is over.

1044
01:04:37,938 --> 01:04:40,972
No longer will this
beautiful Earth be ravaged

1045
01:04:40,974 --> 01:04:44,108
by poison and ignorance.

1046
01:04:44,110 --> 01:04:48,713
No more will this be a world
of screaming meat!

1047
01:05:36,896 --> 01:05:39,597
Is... Is that...

1048
01:05:39,599 --> 01:05:41,666
Yes.

1049
01:05:41,668 --> 01:05:43,037
Swamp Thing.

1050
01:05:58,018 --> 01:06:01,088
Jason Woodrue,

1051
01:06:02,588 --> 01:06:06,124
the Earth has indeed suffered

1052
01:06:06,126 --> 01:06:09,130
at the hands of mankind.

1053
01:06:09,795 --> 01:06:11,662
However,

1054
01:06:11,664 --> 01:06:15,566
this is not the way
to right the wrongs

1055
01:06:15,568 --> 01:06:17,838
done to Mother Gaia.

1056
01:06:18,871 --> 01:06:21,539
Though your cause is just,

1057
01:06:21,541 --> 01:06:23,541
your actions

1058
01:06:23,543 --> 01:06:26,211
have upset the balance

1059
01:06:26,213 --> 01:06:28,149
in the green.

1060
01:06:28,949 --> 01:06:30,215
I'm sorry.

1061
01:06:30,217 --> 01:06:32,249
I'm so sorry.

1062
01:06:32,251 --> 01:06:34,219
- Yes.
- Watch.

1063
01:06:34,221 --> 01:06:36,858
Bet you he's gonna turn
Plant Guy into a stump or something.

1064
01:06:37,791 --> 01:06:40,025
But it is not

1065
01:06:40,027 --> 01:06:43,094
my place to judge.

1066
01:06:43,096 --> 01:06:44,229
Wait, what?

1067
01:06:44,231 --> 01:06:46,798
All will be

1068
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:49,900
as it will be.

1069
01:06:49,902 --> 01:06:54,905
I return now
to the Parliament of Trees,

1070
01:06:54,907 --> 01:06:57,775
to seek the hidden truths

1071
01:06:57,777 --> 01:07:00,110
at the center of eternity...

1072
01:07:00,112 --> 01:07:02,813
No, no, no. No, don't go!

1073
01:07:02,815 --> 01:07:06,184
...to know unknowable nature

1074
01:07:06,186 --> 01:07:10,124
in all its
infinite splendors.

1075
01:07:10,990 --> 01:07:12,289
Screw unknowable nature!

1076
01:07:12,291 --> 01:07:13,760
Kick his butt!

1077
01:07:19,599 --> 01:07:22,737
Farewell.

1078
01:07:35,782 --> 01:07:37,885
Well, that was
a big ass bucket of nothing.

1079
01:07:48,161 --> 01:07:50,894
- Now what?
- There must be a way.

1080
01:07:50,896 --> 01:07:52,630
- I got...
- We've tried everything.

1081
01:07:52,632 --> 01:07:54,733
The sonic disruptor
barely fazed him.

1082
01:07:54,735 --> 01:07:57,635
- What about...
- And the bio-feedback Batarangs didn't do squat.

1083
01:07:57,637 --> 01:07:59,371
- Guys!
- What?

1084
01:07:59,373 --> 01:08:02,740
Look, you are pros here
and all, but...

1085
01:08:02,742 --> 01:08:05,313
Well, he's all
leafy and everything.

1086
01:08:08,782 --> 01:08:10,184
Anybody got a match?

1087
01:08:16,289 --> 01:08:17,658
Oh, shucks.

1088
01:10:54,314 --> 01:10:57,214
<i>After my wife ran off
with the pizza delivery guy</i>

1089
01:10:57,216 --> 01:11:00,220
<i>my OCD started flaring up
and got really bad.</i>

1090
01:11:02,021 --> 01:11:04,321
<i>I've been getting up
six or seven times a night</i>

1091
01:11:04,323 --> 01:11:06,426
<i>making sure the windows
and doors are locked.</i>

1092
01:11:09,595 --> 01:11:11,361
<i>My boss is on my case
all the time</i>

1093
01:11:11,363 --> 01:11:12,996
<i>about my productivity</i>

1094
01:11:12,998 --> 01:11:14,965
<i>since I have a hard time
peeing anywhere</i>

1095
01:11:14,967 --> 01:11:16,503
<i>but my home bathroom.</i>

1096
01:11:17,970 --> 01:11:19,303
I lost my wife.

1097
01:11:19,305 --> 01:11:22,507
Now I may lose my job,
my house, my cats,

1098
01:11:22,509 --> 01:11:26,044
my collection of vintage
toasters and vacuum cleaners.

1099
01:11:26,046 --> 01:11:28,312
If I can't get this problem
under control

1100
01:11:28,314 --> 01:11:30,380
I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

1101
01:11:30,382 --> 01:11:33,518
It sounds to me
like you're a little bit blue.

1102
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:35,452
Oh, yeah?

1103
01:11:35,454 --> 01:11:38,322
And that part about you being
wee-wee shy...

1104
01:11:38,324 --> 01:11:40,058
That's rough.

1105
01:11:40,060 --> 01:11:41,860
I had this cellmate at Arkham
with the same problem.

1106
01:11:41,862 --> 01:11:44,094
I says to her,
"Sugar, we got a glass wall

1107
01:11:44,096 --> 01:11:46,129
"and a toilet
in the middle of the floor.

1108
01:11:46,131 --> 01:11:47,531
"You're in trouble."

1109
01:11:49,536 --> 01:11:50,902
Can you help me?

1110
01:11:50,904 --> 01:11:52,536
Of course I can, silly.

1111
01:11:52,538 --> 01:11:55,505
I'm a regular
<i>Dr. Quinn Medicine Person,</i> ain't I?

1112
01:11:58,177 --> 01:11:59,509
I'm legally required
to remind you

1113
01:11:59,511 --> 01:12:01,612
that my doctorate
is purely honorary

1114
01:12:01,614 --> 01:12:04,350
and I'm not a currently
accredited mental-health professional.

1115
01:12:05,252 --> 01:12:06,550
Okay.

1116
01:12:06,552 --> 01:12:09,419
Well, Wesey.
Okay if I call you Wesey?

1117
01:12:09,421 --> 01:12:11,421
- I don't really like it.
- Well, Wesey...

1118
01:12:11,423 --> 01:12:13,657
You could clearly benefit from therapy.

1119
01:12:13,659 --> 01:12:15,593
I know I did.

1120
01:12:15,595 --> 01:12:17,527
But one thing I learned is that
you never get the most out of stuff

1121
01:12:17,529 --> 01:12:19,330
when it's just handed to you.

1122
01:12:19,332 --> 01:12:20,632
You gotta earn it.

1123
01:12:20,634 --> 01:12:22,366
Right, everybody?

1124
01:12:22,368 --> 01:12:24,568
Now, as everybody knows,

1125
01:12:24,570 --> 01:12:28,373
the road to mental wellness
is paved with pit bulls.

1126
01:12:28,375 --> 01:12:31,009
But all you got to do is
make it to that finish line

1127
01:12:31,011 --> 01:12:33,311
way over there
to win a full year of therapy

1128
01:12:33,313 --> 01:12:36,013
from a real,
honest-to-goodness shrink.

1129
01:12:37,449 --> 01:12:39,349
Come on, don't be like that.

1130
01:12:39,351 --> 01:12:41,585
I've got faith in you, Wesey.

1131
01:12:41,587 --> 01:12:45,192
Time to turn your life around and
start feeling good about yourself again!

1132
01:12:48,929 --> 01:12:51,396
On your mark, get set...

1133
01:12:51,398 --> 01:12:53,196
Get healthy!

1134
01:12:59,538 --> 01:13:02,607
You have to look through
the rain to see the rainbow.

1135
01:13:12,018 --> 01:13:14,454
You'll find love
when you stop looking.

1136
01:13:18,224 --> 01:13:19,624
Hang in there, baby.

1137
01:13:31,270 --> 01:13:34,440
It takes more muscles to frown
than it does to smile.

1138
01:13:48,721 --> 01:13:50,455
Aw! Ain't that a shame?

1139
01:13:50,457 --> 01:13:52,623
Wendell is headed back
to his crummy house

1140
01:13:52,625 --> 01:13:54,525
