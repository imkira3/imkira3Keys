1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,745
After nearly five years
of appeals...

3
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:45,040
Dino Moretti, reputed lieutenant
of the Franco crime family...

4
00:02:45,124 --> 00:02:48,627
was released from prison today,
and acquitted of all charges...

5
00:02:48,711 --> 00:02:51,547
in connection with the murders
of police officer Frank Castle...

6
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,882
and his family.

7
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:55,426
Moretti has long maintained
his innocence...

8
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,928
claims he has no idea
who is responsible...

9
00:02:58,012 --> 00:03:01,724
for the 125 mysterious
gangland murders...

10
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:05,186
often attributed to a shadowy figure
known as the "Punisher"...

11
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:08,147
which have occurred in this city
over the last half decade.

12
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:13,027
- Laurie Silvers has this on the scene report.
- Mr. Moretti?

13
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:16,113
- How does it feel to be finally acquitted?
- It feels great.

14
00:03:16,197 --> 00:03:17,364
Just great.

15
00:03:17,448 --> 00:03:20,075
The government says it's going to appeal.
How do you feel about that?

16
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,870
Let them appeal a hundred times.
I'll still win.

17
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:24,121
This is America.

18
00:03:24,205 --> 00:03:26,707
If a man is innocent,
justice prevails.

19
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:30,294
Are you worried about
the Punisher?

20
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:34,006
Let me tell you something about
this "Punisher", whoever he is.

21
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:38,177
If he ever shows up
within 1,000 yards of me...

22
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,722
he'll find out what the
word "punished" really means.

23
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:44,600
Now, if you'll excuse me.

24
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:47,311
And there you have it.

25
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:50,981
The dapper Don, allegedly head
of the powerful Franco crime family...

26
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:53,984
once again shrugging off
any fear of the Punisher...

27
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:57,947
despite the fact that
over 125 organized crime figures...

28
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:02,076
have been murdered by the self-styled
vigilante in the last five years.

29
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,704
This is Laurie Silvers
for Channel 8 News.

30
00:04:10,376 --> 00:04:13,837
Hey, what do you think?
Maybe I got a future in politics.

31
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:15,965
Okay. Enough of the jokes.
Let's break out the champagne.

32
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:18,175
- I'll get it, boss.
- No. First things first.

33
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:20,302
- You check the house. I'll get the champagne.
- Sure.

34
00:04:20,386 --> 00:04:23,222
Hey Mikey!
Start the music around here.

35
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:38,654
What the fuck?

36
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:18,736
Jesus! Joey!

37
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:31,373
Come on, you guys,
party time.

38
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:35,544
Joey...

39
00:05:39,048 --> 00:05:41,133
- Switch on those cameras!
- Keep them rolling!

40
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:42,676
- Come on, guys!
- Okay.

41
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,094
- Move it!
- Okay.

42
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:50,100
Keep it rolling!
Keep it rolling!

43
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,400
Look, there's somebody there.

44
00:05:58,484 --> 00:06:00,694
I got the tight shot.

45
00:06:01,737 --> 00:06:04,365
- I got it covered. I covered this!
- Who is that?

46
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,159
- Holy shit! The Punisher!
- It's him!

47
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:10,662
- Move in for a close-up! Get a close-up!
- I got it!

48
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:12,623
Are you getting it?

49
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,461
Out of the way!

50
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:24,885
Are you getting it?

51
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:28,847
- I got shit all over the place!
- Keep them going!

52
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:36,563
Come on, God.

53
00:06:36,647 --> 00:06:38,565
Answer me.

54
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:42,611
It's years I'm asking you why.
Why are the innocent dead...

55
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:46,156
and the guilty alive?
Where is justice?

56
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,659
Where is punishment?

57
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:52,913
Or have you already answered?
Have you already said to the world:

58
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:57,167
"Here is justice,
here is punishment."

59
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:59,086
Here...

60
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:01,130
in me.

61
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:05,509
Mommy, aren't we going
to wait for daddy?

62
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:10,347
Daddy's working.
We'll meet him at grandma's. Okay?

63
00:07:16,437 --> 00:07:17,813
Julie!

64
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,232
Julie!

65
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:35,289
Lieutenant,
are you being pressured...

66
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:37,124
to resign as the head
of the "Punisher task force"?

67
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:39,585
- No comment.
- Lieutenant, do you have leads?

68
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:42,254
- No comment.
- Lieutenant, do you still think...

69
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:44,882
that Frank Castle and the Punisher
are the same person?

70
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:47,342
- Absolutely.
- Despite the fact that the official police...

71
00:07:47,426 --> 00:07:49,970
Don't you people have anything
better to do with your time?

72
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:54,475
It's 2:00 in the goddamn morning,
for Christ's sake.

73
00:07:55,476 --> 00:07:58,187
Hey, give me a break.

74
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:04,026
- Now, that was smart. Very smart.
- The chief of detectives.

75
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:06,820
It must be something very important
to bring you out at 2 a.m.

76
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:07,738
- It is.
- Yeah?

77
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,740
I have a message
from the mayor.

78
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:12,826
I quote: "Frank Castle is dead."

79
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:15,871
No more talk about him
being otherwise.

80
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:18,790
You toe the line
or you get the boot.

81
00:08:18,874 --> 00:08:20,792
You'd go along with that, too.

82
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:23,879
Jake, we cannot let the public think
there's some psychotic ex-cop...

83
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:26,965
whacking off wise guys
like he's got a hunting license.

84
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:29,760
Why not? Why not?

85
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:33,680
Berkowitz, it's late.
I'm tired.

86
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:36,058
You're warned.

87
00:08:38,602 --> 00:08:41,188
What the hell
ever happened to you?

88
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:52,366
Okay, Graham,
I'm gonna shoot an update.

89
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,368
- Excuse me, Lieutenant Berkowitz?
- Yeah.

90
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:57,162
- I'm detective Sam Leary.
- Sam?

91
00:08:57,246 --> 00:08:58,580
Samantha.

92
00:08:58,664 --> 00:09:00,707
I worked with you once
five years ago.

93
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:05,671
Did the Moretti heroin bust.
It was my first assignment plain-clothes.

94
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:08,215
- I was the hooker!
- Oh, right.

95
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:10,842
What can I do for you,
detective?

96
00:09:10,926 --> 00:09:13,470
I'd like at shot
at being your partner.

97
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:16,014
- I don't work with a partner.
- But you used to.

98
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:18,684
Right, used to.
Past tense.

99
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:24,314
I'm not after a free ride.
I can carry my share of the load.

100
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:25,691
I'm sure you can.

101
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:28,986
No, you're not.
You're not even listening to me.

102
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:31,863
That's right.
I'm not even listening to you.

103
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:33,824
- Why?
- 'Cause I work with the best.

104
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:36,702
Anything else
is a waste of my time.

105
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:39,246
Besides, so you think
you're the first to apply for this job?

106
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:42,624
- No, but I'm the most qualified.
- What makes you think that?

107
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:45,377
I graduated first in
my class at the academy.

108
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:48,589
I scored in the top 1%
in the target range.

109
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:53,010
I made detective first time up, the second
youngest on the force to do that.

110
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:55,429
It must make
your parents very proud.

111
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:58,599
But why should it make you
my partner?

112
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:04,187
I believe that
Frank Castle's the Punisher.

113
00:10:07,849 --> 00:10:09,851
Know where my office is?

114
00:10:09,934 --> 00:10:11,561
Yeah.

115
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:15,648
You be there at 9:00 sharp.

116
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:25,834
Mr. Franco, how does it feel
to be back home?

117
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:28,712
In the 30 minutes since I've landed:
So far, so good.

118
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:31,632
- Have you come to take over, sir?
- Come on, fellas, it was a long flight.

119
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:34,926
- The man's tired. Give him a break.
- Aren't you afraid of the Punisher?

120
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,345
- The Punisher?
- Yeah.

121
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:39,014
In Europe, they think you made it up
to sell newspapers.

122
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:40,474
There is no Punisher.

123
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:43,143
What's been killing your
associates for five years?

124
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:45,729
Too much stress, I guess.
Thanks for coming.

125
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:48,273
Come on. Vanish!

126
00:10:48,357 --> 00:10:50,150
Just a second.

127
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:54,613
Can I help you, detective?

128
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:59,493
- Oh, you already have, Franco.
- Really? How?

129
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:03,246
Kind of like a worm
helps a fisherman.

130
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:06,667
I'm glad you finally
came home, Gianni.

131
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:10,671
I was running out of bait.
I'll see you around.

132
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:14,591
Too much stress, huh?

133
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:17,094
That's funny.

134
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:21,890
- How'd you like it there, Tommy?
- It was okay.

135
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:24,059
Learn good stuff
in those fancy schools?

136
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:27,104
- Come on, show him something you learned, son.
- You got a quarter?

137
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:29,314
Sure.

138
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:32,192
- Here you go.
- Watch him.

139
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,738
Hey, that's great!

140
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:42,160
- I can do it with $10.
- That's expensive for me.

141
00:11:42,244 --> 00:11:45,622
Give this to Louie in the kitchen
with my compliments.

142
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:48,875
Ask him to give you
more cheesecake.

143
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,544
Lose something?

144
00:11:56,967 --> 00:12:00,262
Okay, so tell me.
How bad is it?

145
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:01,972
How bad?

146
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,935
If you didn't come home,
I would be head of the family.

147
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:11,106
It's not going to be
families anymore.

148
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:14,151
That's old thinking.
It's dad thinking.

149
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:17,779
There'll be no more wars,
no more territories.

150
00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:20,949
How are you going to
convince anyone?

151
00:12:21,616 --> 00:12:24,077
With an act of good faith
so generous...

152
00:12:24,161 --> 00:12:27,247
that even Freddy Deleo
will see the light.

153
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,790
A week from now,
I've arranged...

154
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:33,587
- for 600 kilos of pure junk to come in.
- 600 Ks?

155
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:37,424
$500 million worth.
Everyone gets their share.

156
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:40,802
Provided they work together
to make it happen.

157
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:43,388
One group on security,
one at receiving...

158
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:46,641
one in collecting,
one in distribution..

159
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:48,852
That wouldn't be too hard,
would it?

160
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:52,856
And what do we do
about the Punisher?

161
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:55,567
One thing at a time, Jim.

162
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:58,445
First we consolidate.

163
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:01,615
And then we obliterate.

164
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:20,175
Excuse me, kind sir...

165
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:24,679
but I can't help but see in you
a man far luckier than me.

166
00:13:24,763 --> 00:13:25,764
What?

167
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:28,642
Whatever you can spare
will be sufficient.

168
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:31,561
And this old thespian...

169
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:37,359
- What the hell's a thespian?
- An actor, sir.

170
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:39,069
Oh, sure.

171
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:43,490
- Thank you.
- Hey!

172
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:46,368
What'd I tell you about
bugging the customers?

173
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:49,579
Richie.
Throw this trash out of here.

174
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:54,960
- Alright, let's go.
- You can't treat me like this.

175
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:57,003
- Come on!
- I demand some respect!

176
00:13:57,087 --> 00:14:00,340
I'm not trash! I'm a man!

177
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:07,264
Maybe I should have tried
some Eugene O'Neill.

178
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:52,851
Hi there.

179
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:56,354
Nice weather we are having
for this time of year.

180
00:14:56,438 --> 00:15:01,818
You were supposed
to meet me here four hours ago.

181
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:04,779
I know. I know all about it.
I've been hearing it all my life.

182
00:15:04,863 --> 00:15:07,282
Checks, responsibility...

183
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:12,412
- Can't keep an appointment.
- Where is the dope coming into?

184
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:14,456
The dope?

185
00:15:15,624 --> 00:15:20,170
The dope...
Oh, that. Pier 30.

186
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:28,303
But the location's
not the big story.

187
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:30,347
But who'll be there is.

188
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:33,767
- Who'll be there?
- Everyone.

189
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,852
They're all working together now.

190
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:37,687
One big, happy family...

191
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:42,442
under the fatherly wing
of your old friend Gianni Franco.

192
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:47,822
Mr. P!

193
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:49,824
Happy hunting!

194
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,673
Allez, vite. lls rapprochent.

195
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:13,056
I can't get
this frigging thing to work.

196
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:21,106
- Very difficult...
- Well, fuck you.

197
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:23,274
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

198
00:16:23,358 --> 00:16:26,611
Hey, there's $500 million
out there, assholes.

199
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:29,531
Cool out!
Here, check the perimeter.

200
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:31,366
Get with it!

201
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:36,496
Hello, Red 1?
Come in.

202
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,874
Red 1,
will you get off your ass?

203
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,711
- What?
- Everything's Okay?

204
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:44,212
Yeah!

205
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,406
- Red 2, what have you got?
- Bad kidneys. I got to pee.

206
00:16:53,489 --> 00:16:55,867
So pee.
Everything's okay?

207
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,994
Yeah. It's dead here.

208
00:17:04,701 --> 00:17:07,579
The U.S. Coast guard!
Cut your engines.

209
00:17:08,914 --> 00:17:13,377
- What are you doing here?
- We had to pull into dock.

210
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:16,505
Our hull is leaking.
Down there. Have a look.

211
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:48,312
- 15 minutes late.
- Jesus Christ...

212
00:17:48,395 --> 00:17:53,150
- Fucking faggot Frenchmen.
- Here they come. Here they come!

213
00:18:30,996 --> 00:18:34,041
You're 15 minutes late,
you stupid dickhead.

214
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:36,001
What's the big idea?

215
00:20:24,444 --> 00:20:26,947
Hey, guys, get back there!

216
00:20:27,614 --> 00:20:30,951
600 kilos of dope.
Seven dead wise guys.

217
00:20:31,034 --> 00:20:33,078
All from different families.

218
00:20:34,371 --> 00:20:37,123
Guess it's a drug deal gone bad.

219
00:20:43,897 --> 00:20:45,732
Guess again.

220
00:21:40,654 --> 00:21:44,533
Idiko Tanaka.
She's single, in her early 40s.

221
00:21:44,616 --> 00:21:46,076
She has one daughter.

222
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,371
A mute American girl
she adopted at birth..

223
00:21:49,454 --> 00:21:51,623
Who never leaves her sight.

224
00:21:51,706 --> 00:21:54,000
She's a graduate from
Harvard business school...

225
00:21:54,084 --> 00:21:57,587
and the first female
ever to head the Yakuza.

226
00:21:57,671 --> 00:21:59,631
Yaku... what?

227
00:21:59,714 --> 00:22:01,883
Yakuza.
Japanese mafia.

228
00:22:01,967 --> 00:22:05,095
- This is a long fucking way from Japan.
- It is.

229
00:22:05,178 --> 00:22:07,639
- What are they doing here?
- I don't know.

230
00:22:07,722 --> 00:22:09,724
We are about to find out.

231
00:22:10,308 --> 00:22:11,768
Okay.

232
00:22:21,027 --> 00:22:24,656
- Lady Tanaka.
- Mr. Franco.

233
00:22:24,739 --> 00:22:28,493
It is an honor.
Your reputation precedes you.

234
00:22:28,576 --> 00:22:30,662
As does yours.

235
00:22:30,745 --> 00:22:32,997
- Please sit down.
- No, thank you.

236
00:22:33,081 --> 00:22:36,250
What I have to say will be brief.

237
00:22:36,334 --> 00:22:41,130
We have been tracking your
organization for quite some time.

238
00:22:41,714 --> 00:22:46,928
Your leadership is decimated.
Your soldiers are inexperienced.

239
00:22:47,011 --> 00:22:51,933
Our little demonstration on
Pier 30 was ample proof of that.

240
00:22:53,142 --> 00:22:56,145
You're weak, Mr. Franco.

241
00:22:56,229 --> 00:22:57,981
Vulnerable.

242
00:22:58,564 --> 00:23:00,441
And we are not.

243
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:08,992
We could cripple all your operations
legal, as well as illegal very easily.

244
00:23:12,829 --> 00:23:15,999
- But we don't want that.
- With all clue respect, Miss Tanaka...

245
00:23:16,082 --> 00:23:19,085
let's cut through the bullshit and
get to the heart of the matter.

246
00:23:19,168 --> 00:23:21,546
What do you want?

247
00:23:21,629 --> 00:23:24,298
- A partnership.
- Define the term.

248
00:23:24,382 --> 00:23:29,470
You will continue to manage and oversee
all your business on a day-to-day basis.

249
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:37,395
We will assume the duties of executive
administration, investments, financial services.

250
00:23:37,478 --> 00:23:40,440
- Come on!
- I'm not through.

251
00:23:46,446 --> 00:23:51,617
- What do you propose as a split?
- 75% for us.

252
00:23:51,701 --> 00:23:53,327
25% for you.

253
00:23:54,537 --> 00:23:58,499
No fucking way am I going to be
a salary boy to some bunch of nips.

254
00:23:58,583 --> 00:24:00,543
I don't know about
the rest of you guys...

255
00:24:00,626 --> 00:24:04,172
but the Deleo family gives up shit.
We don't work for nobody.

256
00:24:04,255 --> 00:24:06,591
Who the fuck
do you think you are?

257
00:24:07,425 --> 00:24:09,177
We are Yakuza.

258
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:14,640
When your ancestors were still shepherds
screwing sheep on the Mediterranean coast...

259
00:24:14,724 --> 00:24:17,977
ours were
the crime lords of Asia.

260
00:24:18,853 --> 00:24:22,815
I'm not offering terms,
Mr. Franco, I'm making demands.

261
00:24:22,899 --> 00:24:25,777
And what if we choose
not to comply?

262
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:30,281
Steps are now being taken
to ensure that you will.

263
00:24:30,364 --> 00:24:34,243
You Americans
have a great capacity for violence.

264
00:24:35,161 --> 00:24:38,164
But it's wild, unfocused.

265
00:24:38,247 --> 00:24:40,208
You will learn.

266
00:24:45,463 --> 00:24:47,715
Good day, gentlemen.

267
00:24:50,718 --> 00:24:52,386
What do we do?

268
00:24:53,513 --> 00:24:55,807
Only one thing we can.

269
00:24:56,933 --> 00:24:59,227
We go to war.

270
00:25:10,939 --> 00:25:14,776
What do you think you're going to do
with that? Play Ms. Pac-Man or something?

271
00:25:14,859 --> 00:25:17,195
- Hopefully find Castle.
- No shit.

272
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:19,030
No shit.

273
00:25:19,113 --> 00:25:22,158
How are we going to
accomplish this little miracle?

274
00:25:22,242 --> 00:25:25,119
I've accessed
into all available data banks...

275
00:25:25,203 --> 00:25:27,080
with information on him...

276
00:25:27,163 --> 00:25:29,541
and programmed the computer
to form an analysis...

277
00:25:29,624 --> 00:25:32,919
- Of probable locations.
- Oh, wow.

278
00:25:33,002 --> 00:25:35,505
Even the Punisher
has to live somewhere.

279
00:25:45,557 --> 00:25:47,058
Hey.

280
00:25:48,268 --> 00:25:50,395
- You see this board here?
- Yeah.

281
00:25:50,478 --> 00:25:54,357
I've been living with it for five years.
Every time he kills somebody...

282
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,859
I put a red pin in it.

283
00:25:55,942 --> 00:26:00,488
I fine-tooth every building,
every alley, in this city.

284
00:26:00,572 --> 00:26:03,616
The only thing
that I've got to show for it...

285
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:06,536
is these
little calling cards here...

286
00:26:07,662 --> 00:26:09,289
and a whole bunch of these.

287
00:26:11,708 --> 00:26:14,586
I've already been
through this city.

288
00:26:14,669 --> 00:26:18,339
I've been in it, around it,
on top of it.

289
00:26:18,965 --> 00:26:20,758
You name it.

290
00:26:22,302 --> 00:26:24,470
How about under it?

291
00:26:33,605 --> 00:26:37,317
- I get the red. I hate yellow.
- The red's gross, Jenny.

292
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,986
I think it's totally hot.

293
00:26:41,154 --> 00:26:45,533
Hi. I'm Peter bear.
I really care.

294
00:26:45,617 --> 00:26:49,829
And to show you it's true,
I have some things to teach you.

295
00:26:49,913 --> 00:26:51,414
Like what, Peter?

296
00:27:01,591 --> 00:27:04,302
- Come on!
- Wait up!

297
00:27:06,971 --> 00:27:08,681
Hey, hold it!

298
00:27:10,234 --> 00:27:11,693
Roger?

299
00:27:12,277 --> 00:27:13,403
Roger?

300
00:27:21,854 --> 00:27:23,355
Hello?

301
00:27:23,814 --> 00:27:25,357
Hello?

302
00:27:25,858 --> 00:27:27,651
Come out.

303
00:27:27,934 --> 00:27:30,604
Come out, wherever you are.

304
00:27:32,547 --> 00:27:37,094
Bubble, bubble, toil and trouble,
I better get out of here on the double.

305
00:27:43,684 --> 00:27:45,852
With your flair for entrances...

306
00:27:45,936 --> 00:27:49,815
you should consider
a career in the theater.

307
00:27:49,898 --> 00:27:52,192
I'll think about it.

308
00:27:53,068 --> 00:27:54,403
What are you doing here?

309
00:27:54,486 --> 00:27:59,866
What would I be doing, tramping around
the sewers of this great metropolis?

310
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:03,287
- Sightseeing.
- Very funny.

311
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:07,866
I bring you news,
you give me grief.

312
00:28:07,949 --> 00:28:11,453
You know,
they all think you're dead.

313
00:28:11,536 --> 00:28:14,664
They'll kill each other now.

314
00:28:14,748 --> 00:28:17,459
Turn the lights off
when you leave.

315
00:28:18,218 --> 00:28:19,970
Very clever.

316
00:28:20,053 --> 00:28:22,848
And what will you do
While the carnage ensues?

317
00:28:22,931 --> 00:28:24,349
Take a vacation.

318
00:28:24,433 --> 00:28:28,979
Yes, I hear the sewers of Paris
are lovely this time of year.

319
00:28:29,062 --> 00:28:31,648
And what about the children?

320
00:28:31,974 --> 00:28:34,351
- What children?
- The children of the new bosses...

321
00:28:34,435 --> 00:28:36,770
are now counted
among their losses.

322
00:28:36,854 --> 00:28:40,441
They're being held for ransom
by the Japanese.

323
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,986
So the bosses
will have to pay up.

324
00:28:44,069 --> 00:28:45,821
Pay they will
and all for naught.

325
00:28:45,904 --> 00:28:49,658
The children will be sold by the
slave trade. They've been bought.

326
00:28:50,042 --> 00:28:51,752
My God, man, don't you see?

327
00:28:51,835 --> 00:28:55,005
This is the result
of your five-year killing spree.

328
00:28:55,088 --> 00:28:57,257
You weakened the fathers
to such degrees...

329
00:28:57,341 --> 00:29:00,260
they couldn't protect
their own families.

330
00:29:01,553 --> 00:29:03,847
I punish the guilty.

331
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:07,517
And as a result,
the innocent now suffer.

332
00:29:12,806 --> 00:29:14,808
You must do something!

333
00:29:14,891 --> 00:29:18,144
You must do something.

334
00:29:20,881 --> 00:29:23,968
Enough of this
fucking brainstorming.

335
00:29:24,051 --> 00:29:26,136
Let's snatch her daughter,
take her to the meeting...

336
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,513
with this in her mouth,
then we talk.

337
00:29:27,596 --> 00:29:30,683
Freddy, before you go snatching
anybody, let me tell you a story...

338
00:29:30,766 --> 00:29:33,102
about our Miss Tanaka.

339
00:29:34,728 --> 00:29:39,608
The only person she was ever
close to was her twin brother.

340
00:29:39,692 --> 00:29:42,611
They grew up in a Tokyo orphanage
after the second world war.

341
00:29:42,695 --> 00:29:46,782
They were inseparable.
They lived together their whole lives.

342
00:29:46,865 --> 00:29:49,284
One day he stuck the Yakuza
for a lot of money...

343
00:29:49,368 --> 00:29:52,746
which he had no intention
of paying back.

344
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:56,000
Nothing happened
to him because of her.

345
00:29:56,083 --> 00:29:59,920
Then other people started
getting the same idea.

346
00:30:00,796 --> 00:30:03,424
Before she could become
head of the organization...

347
00:30:03,507 --> 00:30:07,636
the other leaders demanded
an act of absolute loyalty.

348
00:30:08,721 --> 00:30:10,848
You know what she did?

349
00:30:12,099 --> 00:30:14,309
She went home...

350
00:30:14,977 --> 00:30:18,272
cooked her brother
a beautiful meal...

351
00:30:19,106 --> 00:30:21,233
waited until he had finished...

352
00:30:21,316 --> 00:30:24,278
and then slit his throat.

353
00:30:24,361 --> 00:30:26,363
- Jesus.
- What are you saying?

354
00:30:26,447 --> 00:30:30,075
- We don't deal with her?
- I'm saying we can't deal with her.

355
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:33,162
You're saying there's nothing
that can save our kids.

356
00:30:33,245 --> 00:30:36,874
There is, but it's lying
at the bottom of the harbor.

357
00:30:40,469 --> 00:30:45,182
- Well, I'm going to the meeting.
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm going, too.

358
00:30:46,683 --> 00:30:48,894
I'm not.

359
00:32:10,801 --> 00:32:13,512
Good.
The money for the children.

360
00:32:13,595 --> 00:32:17,015
The slave business
is very profitable.

361
00:32:19,393 --> 00:32:21,520
Come on. Don't cry.
We're going to be okay.

362
00:32:21,603 --> 00:32:24,773
We're not going to be okay.
It's because of my father I'm here.

363
00:32:24,857 --> 00:32:26,066
That's not true.

364
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:28,402
Then why are we here,
Mr. Know-It-All?

365
00:32:28,485 --> 00:32:31,655
- I don't know.
- We're being held for ransom...

366
00:32:31,738 --> 00:32:33,657
because our fathers
are rich gangsters.

367
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:36,535
So why am I here?
My father's not a gangster.

368
00:32:36,618 --> 00:32:38,370
Are you kidding?

369
00:32:38,453 --> 00:32:40,873
Your father's the biggest gangster
and a coward.

370
00:32:40,956 --> 00:32:44,501
My dad said if he didn't run from his
responsibilities, there wouldn't be this mess.

371
00:32:44,585 --> 00:32:46,628
- Bullshit!
- You're bullshit!

372
00:32:48,547 --> 00:32:50,549
Hey, stop!

373
00:32:58,849 --> 00:33:01,185
Why are you fighting?

374
00:33:01,894 --> 00:33:04,855
Everything is going to be all right.

375
00:33:04,938 --> 00:33:07,232
I want to go home.

376
00:33:07,316 --> 00:33:09,610
- And you will.
- When?

377
00:33:09,893 --> 00:33:11,520
Soon.

378
00:33:17,034 --> 00:33:20,287
Here, here...
No more tears.

379
00:33:22,706 --> 00:33:24,374
Here.

380
00:33:26,627 --> 00:33:30,005
- Come with me.
- Leave her alone!

381
00:34:18,186 --> 00:34:20,272
- Come in.
- Thank you.

382
00:34:56,683 --> 00:34:58,518
Here's your usual.

383
00:36:04,125 --> 00:36:07,629
Every day the children are gone,
it's going to cost you money.

384
00:36:12,676 --> 00:36:15,470
Take that message
to your people.

385
00:37:06,521 --> 00:37:09,399
Take the money. Run.
Go! Go!

386
00:37:35,158 --> 00:37:39,079
Hold it. Hold it.
Who are these two happy campers?

387
00:37:39,162 --> 00:37:41,539
Don't ask me.
I can't get a word out of them.

388
00:37:41,623 --> 00:37:45,251
Be still.
I said, be still.

389
00:37:45,877 --> 00:37:49,005
You'd think he was hiding
something under there.

390
00:37:49,089 --> 00:37:51,591
- May I?
- Be my guest.

391
00:37:56,596 --> 00:37:59,015
What the hell is this?

392
00:37:59,099 --> 00:38:01,101
Trouble.

393
00:38:01,776 --> 00:38:03,737
Get him out of here.

394
00:38:05,989 --> 00:38:07,365
- I'll get it.
- Okay.

395
00:38:07,449 --> 00:38:09,117
Lieutenant?

396
00:38:23,623 --> 00:38:25,959
- You're not gonna believe this.
- Try me.

397
00:38:26,042 --> 00:38:29,045
The kids of all the new family heads
have been snatched.

398
00:38:29,129 --> 00:38:32,257
They've named the Punisher
as the prime suspect.

399
00:38:34,726 --> 00:38:36,394
They're wrong.

400
00:38:36,478 --> 00:38:40,023
- It makes sense.
- I know it does. But they're wrong.

401
00:38:40,706 --> 00:38:45,711
- Do you have a reason for saying that?
- I've got two reasons for saying that.

402
00:39:12,847 --> 00:39:16,226
My contacts tell me
the kids are here.

403
00:39:17,185 --> 00:39:20,313
- You sure this is it?
- I'd stake my reputation on it.

404
00:39:20,397 --> 00:39:22,732
If I had one.

405
00:39:22,816 --> 00:39:25,110
Do you got a spare?

406
00:39:25,193 --> 00:39:27,612
- What?
- One of those.

407
00:39:28,572 --> 00:39:31,866
If they're holding the kids here,
it's with a fucking arsenal.

408
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:35,245
You move left instead of right,
you're dead.

409
00:39:35,328 --> 00:39:39,040
The critics said the same
thing about my Hamlet.

410
00:39:39,124 --> 00:39:41,334
Stay here.

411
00:39:41,418 --> 00:39:43,336
Watch your back.

412
00:43:33,516 --> 00:43:35,977
That was
a very expensive question...

413
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:39,313
you asked at our place
the other night.

414
00:43:43,109 --> 00:43:47,613
It cost us nearly
2 million dollars in cash.

415
00:43:53,369 --> 00:43:56,998
How much pain
do you think that buys?

416
00:43:58,583 --> 00:44:02,587
Is the question true-false
or multiple choice?

417
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,673
Neither.

418
00:44:21,673 --> 00:44:23,633
Who sent you?

419
00:44:24,634 --> 00:44:26,511
Batman.

420
00:44:39,065 --> 00:44:42,694
Do you get the impression
I don't believe you?

421
00:44:42,777 --> 00:44:45,363
Do you think I give a shit?

422
00:45:01,129 --> 00:45:04,924
You handle your pain very well.

423
00:45:10,138 --> 00:45:14,517
Let's see how well
you handle the pain of others.

424
00:45:39,709 --> 00:45:42,211
Now will you tell me?

425
00:45:44,338 --> 00:45:47,341
You're a very stubborn man.

426
00:45:48,384 --> 00:45:50,094
I have an appointment.

427
00:45:50,178 --> 00:45:53,639
I will leave you
in the hands of Mr. Ito.

428
00:45:58,186 --> 00:46:03,524
He will keep you alive
much longer than you care to be.

429
00:46:03,608 --> 00:46:05,443
Goodbye.

430
00:46:08,613 --> 00:46:10,323
Hey.

431
00:46:12,658 --> 00:46:14,660
Have a nice day.

432
00:46:39,627 --> 00:46:40,920
Wait.

433
00:46:42,588 --> 00:46:44,340
Come here.

434
00:46:45,591 --> 00:46:47,218
I've got something to say.

435
00:46:52,181 --> 00:46:53,349
Sayonara.

436
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,946
I don't want to stretch this out,
so why don't you tell me where the kids are.

437
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:08,948
Deserted warehouse.
Avenue "A".

438
00:47:09,032 --> 00:47:11,826
Take care of the little ones.

439
00:47:13,327 --> 00:47:16,080
Thank you for your cooperation.

440
00:47:22,603 --> 00:47:24,355
You could spend your whole life
down here...

441
00:47:24,438 --> 00:47:26,524
and not find one damn clue.

442
00:47:26,607 --> 00:47:29,819
- Yeah, we could get lucky.
- The eternal optimist, huh?

443
00:47:29,902 --> 00:47:32,697
Look who's talking.
Five years with no leads.

444
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:36,659
Now you're tramping around the sewers
on a computer's hunch.

445
00:47:36,742 --> 00:47:39,036
- How come?
- How come what?

446
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:41,706
How come you never gave up?

447
00:47:41,789 --> 00:47:45,251
I know what it's like
to be given up on.

448
00:47:46,127 --> 00:47:49,463
- Who gave up on you?
- Everybody.

449
00:47:50,131 --> 00:47:53,342
- Except him, right?
- That's right.

450
00:47:53,968 --> 00:47:56,012
So, what happened?

451
00:47:56,679 --> 00:48:00,391
You know how you go out
for a drink after work?

452
00:48:00,474 --> 00:48:02,894
In my case
it was the drink before work...

453
00:48:02,977 --> 00:48:08,441
the drink during work,
and finally the drink instead of work.

454
00:48:08,524 --> 00:48:11,736
Then it became a problem.
Nobody wanted to deal with it.

455
00:48:11,819 --> 00:48:13,779
Especially me.

456
00:48:14,405 --> 00:48:17,700
Before I knew it, I was busted down
to collecting empty shell casings...

457
00:48:17,783 --> 00:48:20,536
on the firing range.

458
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:22,663
Out of sight, out of mind.

459
00:48:22,747 --> 00:48:27,043
Then along comes Frank Castle
with a shiny new detective badge...

460
00:48:27,126 --> 00:48:31,130
and he says he wants to learn
from the guy who wrote the book...

461
00:48:31,214 --> 00:48:34,050
on busting bad guys. Me.

462
00:48:34,133 --> 00:48:38,346
He took me into his life,
Helped me get my act together...

463
00:48:38,429 --> 00:48:40,598
and showed me
how to be a cop again.

464
00:48:40,681 --> 00:48:44,018
So I'm thinking: "What's a little
sewer shit for a friend?"

465
00:48:47,296 --> 00:48:50,842
You know, when we get our kids back, I'll rip
her fucking heart out with my bare hands.

466
00:48:50,925 --> 00:48:52,718
I swear.

467
00:48:53,928 --> 00:48:56,973
None for me.
I'm on medication.

468
00:48:57,056 --> 00:48:58,683
Hey, salud.

469
00:48:58,766 --> 00:49:00,643
Here's to the safe return
of our children.

470
00:49:00,726 --> 00:49:02,145
- Salud.
- Salud.

471
00:49:06,357 --> 00:49:08,317
Here we go.

472
00:49:12,655 --> 00:49:16,325
So, Mr. Franco
decided not to attend.

473
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:20,705
- A wise decision.
- What are you talking about?

474
00:49:31,393 --> 00:49:34,021
You fucking bitch!

475
00:49:42,988 --> 00:49:46,200
Come on! What are you waiting for?
You're going to kill us, do it!

476
00:49:46,283 --> 00:49:48,619
I already have.

477
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:53,499
Champagne.

478
00:49:56,585 --> 00:49:58,170
The glasses.

479
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:28,575
Thirsty, Mr. Deleo?

480
00:50:40,712 --> 00:50:44,049
Since you have refused
the drink...

481
00:50:45,384 --> 00:50:49,805
please, accept the chaser.

482
00:50:53,141 --> 00:50:55,310
Black coffee, Ed.

483
00:50:55,394 --> 00:50:56,645
Thanks.

484
00:50:59,731 --> 00:51:02,401
Hey, that's my bus! Hey!

485
00:51:03,944 --> 00:51:06,238
Hey, that's my stop!

486
00:51:10,534 --> 00:51:11,827
Hey!

487
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:15,289
Hey! You missed my stop.

488
00:51:15,372 --> 00:51:17,040
Sorry.

489
00:51:20,168 --> 00:51:21,837
Thank you.

490
00:51:24,256 --> 00:51:26,049
Don't mention it.

491
00:52:05,672 --> 00:52:07,799
The kid's ready.
The boat sails in an hour.

492
00:52:07,883 --> 00:52:10,510
Hey, I want you to meet Jimmy.

493
00:52:21,355 --> 00:52:23,190
Wake up!

494
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:43,835
It's all right.
Don't be afraid.

495
00:52:48,090 --> 00:52:50,926
I'm here to take you home.

496
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:05,899
Come on. Let's go.

497
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:10,070
Let's go.

498
00:53:11,113 --> 00:53:13,907
Come on. Run. Run.
Into the bus.

499
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:15,742
Move it. Move it.

500
00:53:15,826 --> 00:53:17,619
- They took Tommy away.
- What?

501
00:53:17,703 --> 00:53:20,497
- Down the corridor.
- Cathy! Where's Cathy?

502
00:53:21,873 --> 00:53:23,792
Get in the bus.
Come on.

503
00:53:24,584 --> 00:53:27,713
Stay in the bus, okay?
Stay here.

504
00:53:56,283 --> 00:53:58,076
Tommy.

505
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:01,288
- Where's Cathy?
- I don't know.

506
00:54:01,371 --> 00:54:03,206
Come on.

507
00:54:12,924 --> 00:54:15,927
I came down for my dolly.

508
00:54:18,138 --> 00:54:20,098
Run to the bus, Cathy.

509
00:54:25,187 --> 00:54:26,563
Let him go!

510
00:54:30,484 --> 00:54:31,568
Shoot him!

511
00:54:45,707 --> 00:54:47,584
- Get down!
- Where's Tommy?

512
00:54:47,667 --> 00:54:49,961
They've got him.
I'll get him back.

513
00:55:01,014 --> 00:55:03,475
- All right. Let's go.
- Go! Go!

514
00:55:25,413 --> 00:55:27,123
Hold on!

515
00:55:38,802 --> 00:55:41,221
- Stay down!
- I'm scared!

516
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:22,072
Shit! Cops!

517
00:57:28,203 --> 00:57:29,287
Hold on!

518
00:57:50,850 --> 00:57:52,894
Hold your fire!

519
00:57:52,978 --> 00:57:56,189
- Come on, kids. Come on. Over here.
- Hurry. Hurry.

520
00:57:56,272 --> 00:57:58,191
Is my mommy here?

521
00:57:58,274 --> 00:57:59,776
Hurry!

522
00:57:59,859 --> 00:58:00,777
It's okay!

523
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:48,491
Hello, Frank.

524
00:58:49,909 --> 00:58:51,995
How you been?

525
00:58:55,248 --> 00:58:58,501
- Busy.
- Oh, I know.

526
00:59:03,590 --> 00:59:05,383
I know you have been.

527
00:59:07,469 --> 00:59:10,013
I'm in charge
of the body count.

528
00:59:14,059 --> 00:59:18,104
- What the hell happened, Frank?
- Frank is dead.

529
00:59:18,188 --> 00:59:20,190
All right?

530
00:59:20,273 --> 00:59:22,067
Oh, I see.

531
00:59:22,859 --> 00:59:27,322
So you decided everybody else
had to be dead, too.

532
00:59:27,405 --> 00:59:29,199
- Is that it?
- Nah.

533
00:59:29,282 --> 00:59:33,078
If you're guilty, you're dead.

534
00:59:35,747 --> 00:59:40,752
Courts decide who's guilty, not cops.

535
00:59:40,835 --> 00:59:43,588
"They hereby swear
to uphold the law."

536
00:59:43,671 --> 00:59:45,548
Remember?

537
00:59:50,887 --> 00:59:54,015
I've been looking for you
for five years, man.

538
00:59:57,018 --> 01:00:00,271
Why the hell
didn't you come to me for help?

539
01:00:00,355 --> 01:00:05,318
- I didn't need your help.
- You're sick. You know that, don't you?

540
01:00:09,447 --> 01:00:14,536
- No, I'm not.
- What do you call 125 murders in 5 years?

541
01:00:16,246 --> 01:00:19,541
- Work in progress.
- God damn you! Look!

542
01:00:19,624 --> 01:00:22,085
It's no fucking joke here.

543
01:00:22,168 --> 01:00:24,504
They are going to
electrocute you...

544
01:00:24,587 --> 01:00:26,631
and there's nothing
I can do anything about.

545
01:00:26,714 --> 01:00:30,510
Talk to me, man.
Let me in! Let me in!

546
01:00:30,593 --> 01:00:33,721
They were my fuckin' family, too, Frank.
They were my family, too.

547
01:00:33,805 --> 01:00:37,308
Let me in, God damn it!
Let me in!

548
01:00:39,936 --> 01:00:43,231
I see.
You want to die. Is that it?

549
01:00:43,314 --> 01:00:45,358
Well, fuck you.
Go ahead and die.

550
01:00:45,441 --> 01:00:48,945
The Frank I knew
died five years ago.

551
01:00:49,428 --> 01:00:51,430
Fuck you!

552
01:00:55,877 --> 01:00:57,754
Open this door!

553
01:01:16,306 --> 01:01:18,349
No! Please don't!

554
01:01:24,731 --> 01:01:27,525
<i>In a few moments,
Frank Castle, the ex-police officer...</i>

555
01:01:27,609 --> 01:01:31,863
<i>who's waged a one-man war against
organized crime for the past five years...</i>

556
01:01:31,946 --> 01:01:37,994
<i>will be escorted to court to face an
unprecedented 125 first-degree murder charges.</i>

557
01:01:38,077 --> 01:01:41,331
<i>There's still no news
as to the whereabouts of Tommy Franco...</i>

558
01:01:41,414 --> 01:01:44,876
<i>the son of crime boss
Gianni Franco.</i>

559
01:01:55,637 --> 01:01:57,847
Where's Berkowitz?

560
01:01:57,931 --> 01:01:59,557
Hurting.

561
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:02,936
- What happened between you two?
- What the fuck do you care?

562
01:02:03,019 --> 01:02:06,898
Hey, I care.
I'm his partner.

563
01:02:06,981 --> 01:02:10,526
He carried the burden
for a long time by himself.

564
01:02:11,261 --> 01:02:14,681
He needed help,
and you weren't there.

565
01:02:14,764 --> 01:02:17,308
I was the next best thing.

566
01:02:17,492 --> 01:02:20,036
He resigned from the force
after he saw you.

567
01:02:20,119 --> 01:02:22,497
He lived for the day he found you.

568
01:02:22,580 --> 01:02:26,626
That's all he had,
and now you've taken that away.

569
01:02:26,709 --> 01:02:28,795
He's your best friend.

570
01:02:28,878 --> 01:02:32,048
Why do you want
to take him down with you?

571
01:02:32,131 --> 01:02:35,551
You were his life
before this ever happened...

572
01:02:35,635 --> 01:02:40,348
and you've been his life ever since,
and you fucking well know that!

573
01:02:41,891 --> 01:02:46,229
How long do you think someone can live
after you've cut out their heart?

574
01:02:47,188 --> 01:02:49,649
A long time.

575
01:02:49,732 --> 01:02:53,111
Like you?
Is that what you want for Jake?

576
01:02:53,194 --> 01:02:55,655
To live like you?

577
01:02:58,032 --> 01:03:00,618
- Call him.
- What?

578
01:03:00,702 --> 01:03:03,037
I said, call him.

579
01:03:32,692 --> 01:03:35,403
Nighty-Night, asshole.

580
01:03:50,335 --> 01:03:52,295
Let him be.

581
01:03:56,424 --> 01:03:59,177
What happened to your family
wasn't supposed to.

582
01:03:59,260 --> 01:04:02,513
If I could undo it, I would,
but I can't.

583
01:04:02,597 --> 01:04:07,310
I swear this on the life
of my son Thomas Anthony.

584
01:04:08,811 --> 01:04:11,522
I want him back.

585
01:04:12,732 --> 01:04:16,819
I can't do it myself,
or I would.

586
01:04:17,779 --> 01:04:20,490
I need you, Castle.

587
01:04:20,573 --> 01:04:25,078
I'll give you anything you want.
I'll do anything you wish.

588
01:04:27,246 --> 01:04:29,374
Say something.

589
01:04:29,457 --> 01:04:31,709
Fuck you.

590
01:04:33,086 --> 01:04:35,505
Let me put it another way.

591
01:04:48,393 --> 01:04:50,353
A life for a life.

592
01:04:50,436 --> 01:04:53,689
I'm not going
to ask you twice, Castle.

593
01:04:57,193 --> 01:04:58,444
Well?

594
01:05:07,745 --> 01:05:10,706
Okay.
Okay, I'll do it.

595
01:05:10,790 --> 01:05:12,875
But understand...

596
01:05:14,085 --> 01:05:16,796
When this is over, you're dead.

597
01:05:28,599 --> 01:05:31,227
The elevator stops at 40.
They're on 41.

598
01:05:31,310 --> 01:05:34,814
We need a key to get there,
which the lobby guard has in the lobby.

599
01:05:34,897 --> 01:05:37,066
Five minutes.
Push the first button.

600
01:05:37,150 --> 01:05:39,152
What's that going to do?

601
01:05:41,779 --> 01:05:45,908
- Blow out the lights.
- Sir, just in case,

602
01:05:45,992 --> 01:05:49,120
It's been an honor
to have known you.

603
01:05:50,246 --> 01:05:52,206
Likewise.

604
01:05:52,290 --> 01:05:55,126
Castle, here's some
body armor for you.

605
01:05:55,209 --> 01:05:56,919
Just in case.

606
01:05:57,003 --> 01:05:59,172
Here. Just in case.

607
01:06:00,006 --> 01:06:02,091
Have it your way.

608
01:06:03,134 --> 01:06:05,511
15 minutes.

609
01:06:05,595 --> 01:06:09,474
- You hit the second button.
- What's that going to blow out?

610
01:06:09,557 --> 01:06:11,517
Everything else.

611
01:06:18,941 --> 01:06:20,276
Hey.

612
01:06:21,944 --> 01:06:24,989
- I got to take a leak.
- Be my guest.

613
01:06:25,072 --> 01:06:26,741
That's fine.

614
01:06:28,326 --> 01:06:32,455
I don't know what the boss will say
about a yellow stain on the seat.

615
01:06:39,295 --> 01:06:43,549
Hey, hey, man!
That's skin back there. Take it easy.

616
01:06:44,258 --> 01:06:45,885
What?

617
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:50,681
Are you going to handle
the equipment for me?

618
01:06:55,853 --> 01:06:57,313
In front.

619
01:06:57,396 --> 01:06:59,690
- Can I ask you a question?
- What?

620
01:06:59,774 --> 01:07:01,859
Is an IQ test
required for this job?

621
01:07:01,943 --> 01:07:03,152
No.

622
01:07:06,239 --> 01:07:08,282
I didn't think so.

623
01:07:10,034 --> 01:07:11,953
Hey, man, I got the pizza.

624
01:08:48,925 --> 01:08:51,136
Can I ask you a question?

625
01:08:51,845 --> 01:08:55,181
What's the reason behind
you killing all those guys?

626
01:08:56,266 --> 01:08:58,434
There's a limit to revenge.

627
01:08:58,618 --> 01:09:01,287
Well, I guess,
I haven't reached mine yet.

628
01:09:41,496 --> 01:09:42,706
Which way?

629
01:09:45,125 --> 01:09:46,251
Not that way.

630
01:11:10,852 --> 01:11:12,688
You go that way.

631
01:13:51,457 --> 01:13:52,458
You all right?

632
01:13:52,542 --> 01:13:55,086
Don't worry
about this poor, old slob.

633
01:13:55,169 --> 01:13:57,088
Get on the case.
Do the job.

634
01:13:57,171 --> 01:13:58,756
Hey,hey,
Take care of this guy.

635
01:13:58,839 --> 01:14:02,134
I'll operate under my own steam.
Thank you.

636
01:14:14,781 --> 01:14:16,407
Here. Hold this.

637
01:14:33,165 --> 01:14:35,042
- Tommy!
- Dad!

638
01:14:36,186 --> 01:14:37,453
Tommy!

639
01:14:41,624 --> 01:14:43,293
How long is it gonna take
to get an elevator?

640
01:14:43,376 --> 01:14:44,669
It's hard to say.

641
01:14:44,752 --> 01:14:46,629
Elevators are
very temperamental things.

642
01:14:46,713 --> 01:14:48,881
So are cops who don't like being
jerked around. Now how long?

643
01:14:48,965 --> 01:14:52,051
- 10 minutes.
- How long? Hey, how long?

644
01:14:52,135 --> 01:14:53,803
Uh, five minutes?

645
01:14:56,022 --> 01:14:58,357
Ah, Mr. Franco.

646
01:14:58,441 --> 01:15:01,068
How nice to see you again.

647
01:15:01,152 --> 01:15:03,112
Let him go.

648
01:15:04,163 --> 01:15:06,833
You've gotten everything
you wanted.

649
01:15:08,242 --> 01:15:10,161
Not quite yet.

650
01:16:38,575 --> 01:16:41,453
Take another step, Mr. Franco.

651
01:16:41,536 --> 01:16:43,413
Well, you can't win here.

652
01:16:43,496 --> 01:16:47,208
- You kill him, I kill you.
- And who loses more?

653
01:16:47,292 --> 01:16:49,753
Certainly not me.

654
01:16:58,470 --> 01:17:02,015
- What do you want?
- On your knees.

655
01:17:03,767 --> 01:17:05,852
On your knees!

656
01:17:10,565 --> 01:17:13,026
Put the gun in your mouth.

657
01:17:15,570 --> 01:17:18,949
You have my word he will live.

658
01:17:19,032 --> 01:17:23,286
- How do I know you'll keep it?
- You don't.

659
01:17:23,370 --> 01:17:26,122
But some chance is better
than no chance.

660
01:17:33,046 --> 01:17:37,634
All the way in.
Pull that trigger, Mr. Franco.

661
01:17:37,717 --> 01:17:39,094
Now! Now!

662
01:17:39,177 --> 01:17:42,222
This is part of your education.
You watch.

663
01:17:43,181 --> 01:17:45,266
Goodbye, Mr. Franco.

664
01:18:04,170 --> 01:18:06,047
All right, guys. Let's go.

665
01:18:08,883 --> 01:18:10,885
Tommy?

666
01:18:10,968 --> 01:18:11,761
Dad!

667
01:18:12,553 --> 01:18:14,180
Tommy!

668
01:18:15,264 --> 01:18:17,934
Let me have a look at you.
Care to walk?

669
01:18:18,017 --> 01:18:20,478
- Yeah.
- Okay. Come on.

670
01:18:28,986 --> 01:18:31,531
Wait outside, my son.

671
01:18:31,614 --> 01:18:33,449
Come on.
I'll see to him.

672
01:18:33,533 --> 01:18:36,244
- I can help him.
- Wait outside, Tommy.

673
01:18:50,299 --> 01:18:52,718
I must compliment you, Castle.

674
01:18:52,802 --> 01:18:55,638
You've done something
I never dreamed possible.

675
01:18:55,721 --> 01:18:58,391
You've wiped out
the competition.

676
01:18:58,474 --> 01:19:01,435
Thanks to you,
there's only me.

677
01:19:01,519 --> 01:19:04,105
In five years' time,
my new organization...

678
01:19:04,188 --> 01:19:07,859
will be the most powerful
crime syndicate on earth...

679
01:19:07,942 --> 01:19:12,780
and that boy whose life
you saved will inherit all of it.

680
01:19:13,531 --> 01:19:16,576
And the only thing
he will have to fear...

681
01:19:16,659 --> 01:19:19,245
I'm about to eliminate.

682
01:19:22,540 --> 01:19:25,376
You gave me back my son.
Thank you very much.

683
01:19:25,459 --> 01:19:27,920
I'm in your debt.

684
01:19:29,088 --> 01:19:31,841
- See you in hell, Castle.
- Dad!

685
01:19:32,383 --> 01:19:34,010
Tommy!

686
01:20:26,729 --> 01:20:28,105
Dad, Stop!

687
01:20:28,689 --> 01:20:30,483
Stop!

688
01:20:33,277 --> 01:20:34,987
Dad, get off him!

689
01:21:18,239 --> 01:21:19,615
Dad?

690
01:21:20,157 --> 01:21:21,283
Dad...

691
01:21:38,676 --> 01:21:40,636
I'm going to kill you.

692
01:21:46,976 --> 01:21:47,983
Good.

693
01:21:49,311 --> 01:21:52,231
Maybe if you get it
over with now...

694
01:21:52,898 --> 01:21:55,901
you won't grow up
to be like him.

695
01:22:06,037 --> 01:22:07,788
Come on.

696
01:22:08,539 --> 01:22:10,124
Do it.

697
01:22:10,708 --> 01:22:12,418
Do it.

698
01:22:15,421 --> 01:22:17,173
Do it.

699
01:22:31,812 --> 01:22:33,230
What the hell?

700
01:22:33,314 --> 01:22:34,190
Whoa...

701
01:22:34,273 --> 01:22:36,567
All right. Split up.

702
01:22:36,650 --> 01:22:37,735
Frank?

703
01:22:38,444 --> 01:22:40,154
Frank?

704
01:22:49,455 --> 01:22:51,832
You're a good boy, Tommy.

705
01:22:52,875 --> 01:22:55,628
Grow up to be a good man.

706
01:23:03,803 --> 01:23:05,888
Because if not...

707
01:23:06,430 --> 01:23:08,599
I'll be waiting.

708
01:23:24,281 --> 01:23:26,325
Are you all right?

709
01:23:27,284 --> 01:23:29,703
Which way did he go?

710
01:23:53,644 --> 01:23:54,854
Frank!

711
01:23:59,817 --> 01:24:01,569
Frank!

712
01:24:11,453 --> 01:24:14,123
I still talk to God sometimes.

713
01:24:14,206 --> 01:24:18,377
I ask him if what I'm doing
is right or wrong.

714
01:24:18,460 --> 01:24:21,547
I'm still waiting for an answer.

715
01:24:21,630 --> 01:24:24,800
And until I get one,
I'll be out here.

716
01:24:24,884 --> 01:24:28,053
Waiting.
Watching.

717
01:24:29,180 --> 01:24:31,724
The guilty will be punished.

717
01:24:32,305 --> 01:25:32,636
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
