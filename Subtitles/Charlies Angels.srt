2
00:00:54,599 --> 00:00:58,603
I said, "Look, lady, the seats haven't
gotten smaller...

3
00:00:58,937 --> 00:01:01,606
...your ass has gotten bigger."

4
00:01:45,942 --> 00:01:49,696
I'm sorry, sir. This cabin is
restricted to first class.

5
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:51,948
Are you looking for this?

6
00:01:53,867 --> 00:01:55,785
Can I get you anything?

7
00:01:56,119 --> 00:01:59,789
Scotch. Blended. Straight.

8
00:02:03,043 --> 00:02:05,545
This is your captain speaking.

9
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:08,715
We've got a report
of some turbulence ahead.

10
00:02:09,049 --> 00:02:13,386
Please return to your seats
and fasten your seat belts...

11
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:18,058
...and remain there until we release
the fasten-your-seat-belt sign.

12
00:02:26,566 --> 00:02:29,069
I hear birds can't fly this high.

13
00:02:29,903 --> 00:02:32,489
I hear only angels can.

14
00:02:38,328 --> 00:02:39,913
Where's the bomb?

15
00:02:41,581 --> 00:02:43,166
I am the bomb.

16
00:02:46,169 --> 00:02:50,090
-Shall I pour your scotch?
-No, I'll take the bottle.

17
00:02:58,431 --> 00:03:01,268
Another movie from an old TV show.

18
00:03:01,601 --> 00:03:03,270
What are you gonna do?

19
00:03:06,106 --> 00:03:07,440
Walk out.

20
00:03:08,275 --> 00:03:09,776
Very funny.

21
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,736
No, it isn't.

22
00:03:12,612 --> 00:03:14,781
What are you doing?!

23
00:03:15,115 --> 00:03:17,617
What are you doing?! Get off of me!

24
00:03:43,226 --> 00:03:45,145
Help me! Help me!

25
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:50,525
Help me! Be careful!

26
00:04:30,065 --> 00:04:31,608
Nice flight?

27
00:04:54,589 --> 00:04:56,091
You crazy bastard!

28
00:04:58,426 --> 00:05:00,929
I think you mean "crazy bitch."

29
00:05:06,268 --> 00:05:08,937
What is this?
What's going on here?

30
00:05:09,604 --> 00:05:11,273
Damn, I hate to fly.

31
00:05:11,773 --> 00:05:13,942
No way! No way!

32
00:05:14,276 --> 00:05:17,279
What's with that?!
Who are you people?!

33
00:05:17,612 --> 00:05:19,614
Who are you people?!

34
00:05:23,785 --> 00:05:28,290
Once upon a time, there were three
very different little girls.

35
00:05:55,817 --> 00:05:58,820
...who grew up to be
three very different women.

36
00:05:59,154 --> 00:06:02,824
--making her a five-day champion.
Way to go, Natalie.

37
00:06:03,158 --> 00:06:07,162
They have three things in common:
They're brilliant, beautiful...

38
00:06:07,495 --> 00:06:09,497
I'm going to be all over you!

39
00:06:09,748 --> 00:06:12,083
You will be kissing my ass--

40
00:06:14,169 --> 00:06:16,338
...and they work for me.

41
00:06:16,671 --> 00:06:18,840
My name is Charlie.

42
00:06:31,895 --> 00:06:33,688
-Let's go this way.
-No!

43
00:06:34,105 --> 00:06:35,023
This way!

44
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:37,526
Wait. I'm not a yo-yo!

45
00:07:09,891 --> 00:07:11,726
Good morning, Starfish.

46
00:07:14,062 --> 00:07:16,398
Good morning, Chad.

47
00:07:16,731 --> 00:07:18,567
Sweet Chad.

48
00:07:19,234 --> 00:07:21,736
I figured we could have a little
breakfast.

49
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:24,573
And then, maybe, after...

50
00:07:25,407 --> 00:07:27,742
...we could have a little Chad.

51
00:07:32,163 --> 00:07:33,498
Hold that thought.

52
00:07:39,588 --> 00:07:41,756
Yes, I'll be right in.

53
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,262
Isn't that just the luck?

54
00:07:47,596 --> 00:07:49,431
I can make something besides eggs.

55
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:52,142
No, it's not the eggs.

56
00:07:52,434 --> 00:07:53,768
Is it the boat?

57
00:07:54,102 --> 00:07:57,606
It's not the boat. I have to go.

58
00:07:59,274 --> 00:08:00,859
Is it the Chad?

59
00:08:02,611 --> 00:08:04,613
It might be the Chad.

60
00:08:09,951 --> 00:08:11,453
It's the Chad!

61
00:08:12,954 --> 00:08:14,623
It's the Chad!

62
00:08:17,792 --> 00:08:19,961
Eduardo, move me.

63
00:09:40,292 --> 00:09:41,209
Good morning.

64
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:45,213
I signed the waiver, so feel free
to stick things in my slot.

65
00:09:49,384 --> 00:09:50,719
Thanks.

66
00:09:51,011 --> 00:09:52,220
No problem.

67
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:59,811
Hey! I'll be right in.

68
00:10:01,354 --> 00:10:04,858
I want to get one thing straight
between us.

69
00:10:05,066 --> 00:10:08,737
Go ahead. We 're past keeping secrets
at this point.

70
00:10:09,029 --> 00:10:10,864
This is going to be long...

71
00:10:11,198 --> 00:10:13,867
...hard and rough.

72
00:10:15,035 --> 00:10:18,038
Sometimes when it's rough,
I just get there faster.

73
00:10:18,371 --> 00:10:22,876
If you don't defuse this bomb,
L.A. will be an underwater attraction.

74
00:10:23,376 --> 00:10:26,213
Which wire?
The red one or the blue one?

75
00:10:28,215 --> 00:10:29,883
That is not helping.

76
00:10:30,217 --> 00:10:31,885
Ooh, my muffins.

77
00:10:32,719 --> 00:10:36,389
This is stupid, anyway.
Why wouldn't I just yank the wire?

78
00:10:36,723 --> 00:10:40,560
They're dummy wires, honey.
The real mechanism is inside.

79
00:10:40,894 --> 00:10:44,564
Trip the external feedback circuit,
the bomb will detonate.

80
00:10:45,732 --> 00:10:47,734
Wow.

81
00:10:48,568 --> 00:10:52,405
For a bikini waxer,
you know a lot about bombs.

82
00:10:56,243 --> 00:11:00,455
Isn't it amazing how much information
you can learn off the internet?

83
00:11:08,964 --> 00:11:11,132
I'll be right there.

84
00:11:14,261 --> 00:11:16,471
When do I get to meet this Charlie?

85
00:11:16,763 --> 00:11:19,099
Charlie's not a very social person.

86
00:11:19,766 --> 00:11:22,435
But Charlie's a chick though, right?

87
00:11:24,104 --> 00:11:27,440
I mean, definitely a woman, right?

88
00:11:31,444 --> 00:11:34,114
I can't keep up this facade
with Jason anymore.

89
00:11:34,447 --> 00:11:37,492
Who wants a man who's intimidated
by a strong woman?

90
00:11:37,784 --> 00:11:42,622
They come on nice until they find out
I can shatter a block with my head.

91
00:11:42,831 --> 00:11:44,082
I love that trick.

92
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:45,834
Blueberry muffins.

93
00:11:46,126 --> 00:11:48,128
I made them from scratch.

94
00:11:51,131 --> 00:11:52,465
Yum.

95
00:11:52,674 --> 00:11:54,009
Sounds good.

96
00:11:54,634 --> 00:11:56,970
These look great, Alex.

97
00:11:57,637 --> 00:11:58,972
Oh, my God.

98
00:12:09,524 --> 00:12:10,692
What's this?

99
00:12:11,151 --> 00:12:12,652
Chinese fighting muffin.

100
00:12:14,321 --> 00:12:15,655
Nothing to laugh about.

101
00:12:15,864 --> 00:12:20,327
My buddy took a fighting muffin in the
chest, he went home in 4 Ziploc bags.

102
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:24,164
They're not Chinese. They're not
fighting. They're blueberry.

103
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,001
Are you okay?

104
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:30,712
She's having secret-identity trouble.

105
00:12:31,004 --> 00:12:32,005
Aren't we all?

106
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:33,507
Scoot.

107
00:12:37,177 --> 00:12:38,512
Alex...

108
00:12:38,845 --> 00:12:40,680
...all my Angels...

109
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:44,351
...the heart is a muscle.

110
00:12:45,685 --> 00:12:48,188
In body building,
we exercise the muscle...

111
00:12:48,396 --> 00:12:51,024
...and it grows bigger and stronger.

112
00:12:51,316 --> 00:12:53,401
It's the same with the heart.

113
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:55,362
I must have the heart of a rhino.

114
00:12:55,695 --> 00:12:58,031
You do. Be proud of it.

115
00:13:00,867 --> 00:13:02,536
Mes Anges...

116
00:13:02,869 --> 00:13:04,538
...these little hurts will heal.

117
00:13:05,705 --> 00:13:09,876
And at crunch time,
your hearts will be so buff...

118
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:13,213
...you'll be able to clean
and jerk his love...

119
00:13:13,547 --> 00:13:16,049
...three sets, 1 0 reps each.

120
00:13:16,383 --> 00:13:18,051
Thanks, Bos.

121
00:13:19,886 --> 00:13:23,056
Excuse me.
I have to take a phone call.

122
00:13:28,562 --> 00:13:28,687
Good morning, Angels.

123
00:13:28,687 --> 00:13:29,896
Good morning, Angels.

124
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:31,565
Good morning, Charlie.

125
00:13:31,773 --> 00:13:36,111
Dylan, Alex, Natalie, I hope you're
ready for your next assignment.

126
00:13:37,571 --> 00:13:42,576
Meet Eric Knox, a brilliant engineer
and founder of Knox Technologies...

127
00:13:42,909 --> 00:13:46,246
...an up-and-coming communications
software company.

128
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,748
Last night, Knox was kidnapped...

129
00:13:48,957 --> 00:13:51,918
...and his voice-identification
software was stolen.

130
00:13:55,922 --> 00:13:57,257
Who's the lady?

131
00:13:57,591 --> 00:14:00,927
Vivian Wood,
president of Knox Technologies.

132
00:14:01,136 --> 00:14:02,637
Oh, she did it.

133
00:14:03,847 --> 00:14:05,891
I guess we can all go home then.

134
00:14:06,099 --> 00:14:09,603
Angels, meet Vivian Wood,
our new client.

135
00:14:10,312 --> 00:14:12,480
She's hired us to find Eric Knox.

136
00:14:12,814 --> 00:14:13,773
Hello.

137
00:14:13,982 --> 00:14:17,485
Who'd have the most to gain
from Knox's disappearance?

138
00:14:17,777 --> 00:14:19,988
Me, probably. I'm his partner.

139
00:14:20,614 --> 00:14:22,616
Before we were partners...

140
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:24,951
...we were friends.

141
00:14:25,619 --> 00:14:27,621
Does Knox have any enemies?

142
00:14:27,954 --> 00:14:29,956
Roger Corwin. He's owner...

143
00:14:30,165 --> 00:14:34,794
...of Red Star, the largest
communications satellite firm.

144
00:14:35,003 --> 00:14:37,839
Six months ago,
he tried to buy Knox Technologies.

145
00:14:38,131 --> 00:14:40,800
When Knox refused to sell,
Corwin lost it.

146
00:14:41,134 --> 00:14:42,135
Charming.

147
00:14:42,344 --> 00:14:43,678
Was there a ransom demand?

148
00:14:44,012 --> 00:14:47,474
Nothing. But I know he's still alive.

149
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:50,977
I'll study the garage footage.
Something may be there.

150
00:14:51,311 --> 00:14:55,315
So Corwin is our only lead.
Hopefully, he'll take us to Knox.

151
00:14:55,649 --> 00:15:00,153
Corwin gets a weekly massage
at Madame Wong's House of Blossoms.

152
00:15:00,487 --> 00:15:03,657
That's our chance to feel him out.

153
00:15:04,157 --> 00:15:05,825
He said what?

154
00:15:06,326 --> 00:15:08,828
"Over my dead body"?

155
00:15:09,829 --> 00:15:12,165
I can accept those terms.

156
00:15:13,667 --> 00:15:18,672
It's getting a little chilly in here,
Yoko. I could use some warming up.

157
00:15:22,175 --> 00:15:23,677
At your service.

158
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:25,178
Good.

159
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:28,682
Could we get started this millennium?

160
00:15:30,851 --> 00:15:32,519
Banzai!

161
00:15:37,691 --> 00:15:39,359
Ooh, yeah.

162
00:15:40,068 --> 00:15:42,237
You're holding a lot of tension...

163
00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:44,531
...in your 4th and 5th vertebrae.

164
00:15:44,739 --> 00:15:45,740
I know.

165
00:15:46,032 --> 00:15:48,702
Let me see if I can work that...

166
00:15:50,704 --> 00:15:52,038
...out.

167
00:15:54,374 --> 00:15:59,379
By activating the right energy points,
you can increase circulation...

168
00:16:01,047 --> 00:16:03,049
...alleviate pain...

169
00:16:03,717 --> 00:16:05,552
...or even...

170
00:16:07,762 --> 00:16:09,764
...render a man unconscious.

171
00:16:26,907 --> 00:16:28,575
Okay, let's go.

172
00:16:33,246 --> 00:16:34,581
Palm Pilot.

173
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:43,089
Got the car key.

174
00:16:46,092 --> 00:16:47,928
I got his schedule.

175
00:16:58,271 --> 00:17:00,273
You must have dozed off.

176
00:17:00,941 --> 00:17:02,609
You're very good...

177
00:17:03,151 --> 00:17:05,111
...with your hands.

178
00:17:05,946 --> 00:17:08,782
I could use someone
like you on my staff.

179
00:17:09,282 --> 00:17:14,287
Thanks for the offer, but my hands
aren't going anywhere near your staff.

180
00:17:20,502 --> 00:17:23,255
If Corwin is behind Knox's
disappearance...

181
00:17:23,588 --> 00:17:26,508
...someone else
is doing his dirty work.

182
00:17:34,933 --> 00:17:37,394
How's it coming
with the kidnapping footage?

183
00:17:37,727 --> 00:17:40,772
I'm enhancing a reflection
from the car window.

184
00:17:45,652 --> 00:17:46,820
May I take your order?.

185
00:17:47,153 --> 00:17:51,491
Three cheeseburgers, three
French fries and three cherry pies.

186
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,034
What do you guys want?

187
00:17:55,871 --> 00:17:57,539
Here's one of the kidnappers.

188
00:17:57,831 --> 00:17:59,499
Creepy Thin Man.

189
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:01,501
Now we just look for him.

190
00:18:01,835 --> 00:18:03,545
And see if he works for Corwin.

191
00:18:03,837 --> 00:18:05,172
What's Corwin doing tonight?

192
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:07,174
Who's up for crashing a party?

193
00:18:30,197 --> 00:18:31,531
Bos.

194
00:18:31,865 --> 00:18:33,867
-Thanks, Nat.
-No problem.

195
00:18:34,868 --> 00:18:37,871
It's a mic-transmitter.
Put it on your back molar.

196
00:18:38,205 --> 00:18:39,873
I know. It's a mouth-mic.

197
00:18:40,081 --> 00:18:42,417
We'll be able to always stay in touch.

198
00:18:49,174 --> 00:18:52,052
We're in deep cover now, so if...

199
00:18:52,385 --> 00:18:57,224
...you can't remember John David,
just call me J.D. Think of....

200
00:18:57,432 --> 00:19:00,101
-Jelly doughnut.
-Jack Daniels.

201
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,230
-Juvenile delinquents.
-John DeLorean.

202
00:19:09,778 --> 00:19:12,113
There's your date, J.D.

203
00:19:13,573 --> 00:19:15,575
Excuse me, ladies.

204
00:19:19,246 --> 00:19:20,914
Roger Corwin. Welcome.

205
00:19:21,248 --> 00:19:23,917
John David Rage, self-help guru.

206
00:19:24,251 --> 00:19:26,253
John David Rage?

207
00:19:26,586 --> 00:19:28,755
Relax, Bos. Order a drink.

208
00:19:29,756 --> 00:19:31,424
Excuse me. Miss?

209
00:19:32,259 --> 00:19:33,635
Hi...miss.

210
00:19:33,927 --> 00:19:35,929
-A hammerhead, please.
-No problem.

211
00:19:37,806 --> 00:19:39,808
Any creepy thin men?

212
00:19:40,267 --> 00:19:42,143
Lots of creepy, none thin.

213
00:19:42,435 --> 00:19:44,104
-l was wondering if--
-No.

214
00:19:44,437 --> 00:19:47,148
-So there's no chance--
-No.

215
00:19:55,782 --> 00:19:57,117
That's incredible.

216
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:58,451
What is?

217
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,537
Your smile.

218
00:20:02,205 --> 00:20:03,456
Thanks.

219
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:09,171
This place, it's Japanese, is it not?

220
00:20:09,504 --> 00:20:11,715
It's a 1 3th-century Shinto temple.

221
00:20:12,549 --> 00:20:13,884
I had it....

222
00:20:14,676 --> 00:20:17,137
I had it FedEx'd from Kyoto.

223
00:20:17,512 --> 00:20:18,847
Blowfish?

224
00:20:19,055 --> 00:20:20,390
Isn't that poisonous?

225
00:20:20,682 --> 00:20:25,645
It's a rare delicacy for the man who
has no fear of an excruciating death.

226
00:20:27,689 --> 00:20:30,317
Technically, 1 in 60 is fatal.

227
00:20:41,203 --> 00:20:42,162
Tastes like chicken.

228
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:45,373
That would go
very nicely with broccoli.

229
00:20:47,709 --> 00:20:49,336
The man laughs at death.

230
00:20:49,711 --> 00:20:53,340
Good work, Bos.
Get him to talk about Knox.

231
00:20:53,715 --> 00:20:56,551
At last, a worthy adversary.

232
00:20:57,052 --> 00:21:00,764
Let's see if you can survive
a test of intuition and judgment.

233
00:21:06,895 --> 00:21:09,731
Nat, that bartender is cute.

234
00:21:10,065 --> 00:21:11,441
I'm working.

235
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:14,653
He likes you.
Go back and flirt a little.

236
00:21:20,367 --> 00:21:21,535
That was fast.

237
00:21:21,868 --> 00:21:24,412
I'm not called Balls-Out Natalie
for nothing.

238
00:21:25,872 --> 00:21:27,040
Right.

239
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:29,918
I never saw you working here before.

240
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:33,922
I'm new. I'm like a virgin.
I mean, it's my first time...

241
00:21:35,257 --> 00:21:37,425
...here at Corwin's.

242
00:21:38,385 --> 00:21:41,054
Oh, boy. She's going down.

243
00:21:41,388 --> 00:21:43,223
No way. He's into her.

244
00:21:43,557 --> 00:21:46,393
Just pick up the tray and walk away.

245
00:21:46,893 --> 00:21:49,729
No, no. Stay. Stay and talk to him.

246
00:21:50,897 --> 00:21:52,566
Flip your hair.

247
00:21:53,233 --> 00:21:56,236
Flip your goddamn hair.

248
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:14,087
Excuse me. I don't usually do this,
but I was wondering--

249
00:22:14,421 --> 00:22:17,090
Unless you're already
seeing someone else.

250
00:22:17,424 --> 00:22:18,300
Yeah.

251
00:22:18,592 --> 00:22:19,968
-Of course you are.
-No!

252
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,636
I'm not seeing anyone.

253
00:22:23,638 --> 00:22:24,973
Free.

254
00:22:25,432 --> 00:22:28,101
Okay, Thursday?

255
00:22:29,311 --> 00:22:30,312
My favorite day.

256
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:32,439
Great. I'll get tickets.

257
00:22:32,647 --> 00:22:33,773
I love tickets.

258
00:22:35,108 --> 00:22:37,611
What do you know?
A guy who speaks Natalie.

259
00:22:37,944 --> 00:22:38,987
Where's J.D.?

260
00:23:09,935 --> 00:23:11,937
Will somebody help me up, please?

261
00:23:12,187 --> 00:23:14,648
Hello, girls? Are you hearing me?

262
00:23:22,989 --> 00:23:24,324
Thin Man, 1 0:00.

263
00:24:01,987 --> 00:24:03,697
Why do they always run?

264
00:24:40,108 --> 00:24:41,067
Watch it!

265
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:53,914
Nat!

266
00:25:04,633 --> 00:25:05,467
Brace!

267
00:25:05,926 --> 00:25:06,676
Jump!

268
00:27:00,081 --> 00:27:01,041
Check them all!

269
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,008
-Clear!
-Clear!

270
00:27:10,258 --> 00:27:11,343
Clear!

271
00:27:39,204 --> 00:27:40,205
Knox.

272
00:27:42,707 --> 00:27:45,710
Great work, Angels,
but our job's only half-finished.

273
00:27:46,044 --> 00:27:49,464
There 's still the matter
of Mr. Knox's stolen technology.

274
00:27:50,298 --> 00:27:52,634
What's so special about your software?

275
00:27:53,718 --> 00:27:57,055
It's.... It's really quite amazing.

276
00:27:57,389 --> 00:28:01,726
We developed a program. You see,
everyone's voice is unique.

277
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,728
It has a unique signature...

278
00:28:04,062 --> 00:28:07,899
...like a snowflake.
And it can be mapped--

279
00:28:08,233 --> 00:28:13,154
Audio DNA. It makes it impossible to
disguise or scramble a voice signal.

280
00:28:13,405 --> 00:28:15,740
Which is why Corwin wants it.

281
00:28:15,991 --> 00:28:20,745
Of course. All Red Star's satellites
have global positioning systems.

282
00:28:21,162 --> 00:28:23,748
Combine that
with voice identification--

283
00:28:23,999 --> 00:28:26,626
--any cell phone could be a homing
device.

284
00:28:26,918 --> 00:28:28,336
No one could hide.

285
00:28:28,587 --> 00:28:32,090
Imagine how dangerous this would be
in the wrong hands.

286
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,300
The end of privacy.

287
00:28:33,592 --> 00:28:35,635
That's where you come in, Angels.

288
00:28:35,886 --> 00:28:39,306
Corwin is premiering his Red Star
racer at the California Speedway.

289
00:28:39,556 --> 00:28:42,809
Our chance to plant
a hidden camera on Corwin.

290
00:28:43,059 --> 00:28:45,395
Looks like it's off to the races,
Angels.

291
00:28:46,062 --> 00:28:50,066
When Roger Corwin first got
involved in the world of racing...

292
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:55,071
...a lot of people said it was
a stopgap for my waning libido.

293
00:28:55,572 --> 00:28:57,574
I had them all fired.

294
00:29:00,368 --> 00:29:02,787
What's so funny? I did.

295
00:29:04,581 --> 00:29:07,250
Thanks for coming
to this little test run.

296
00:29:16,676 --> 00:29:17,677
Nat...

297
00:29:18,803 --> 00:29:19,804
...I'm going in.

298
00:29:21,473 --> 00:29:22,974
But what can I say?

299
00:29:23,308 --> 00:29:25,602
It's a Red Star day for me.

300
00:29:27,437 --> 00:29:29,773
Then it's back
to the day-to-day grind...

301
00:29:30,106 --> 00:29:33,276
...of world domination
and enslavement.

302
00:29:41,451 --> 00:29:42,786
Hi.

303
00:29:50,502 --> 00:29:52,003
Work your magic.

304
00:29:56,967 --> 00:29:59,469
It's hot out there.

305
00:30:03,306 --> 00:30:05,308
It's hot in here too.

306
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:09,229
Maybe I can make
you more comfortable.

307
00:30:18,822 --> 00:30:21,491
Oh, I've come undone.

308
00:30:23,994 --> 00:30:25,328
That feels good.

309
00:30:26,288 --> 00:30:27,706
Thank you.

310
00:30:35,172 --> 00:30:37,007
I like what you've done with it.

311
00:30:39,676 --> 00:30:41,261
Ours has bigger mirrors.

312
00:30:48,018 --> 00:30:50,187
I love cars.

313
00:30:51,438 --> 00:30:52,856
You like fast cars?

314
00:30:57,861 --> 00:31:00,197
I like fast everything.

315
00:31:03,366 --> 00:31:04,367
Oh, my God.

316
00:31:08,121 --> 00:31:09,456
Thanks for the ride.

317
00:31:09,706 --> 00:31:11,041
You're welcome.

318
00:31:18,131 --> 00:31:22,469
Mission accomplished. Tomorrow,
Corwin will give us a tour of Red Star.

319
00:31:23,053 --> 00:31:25,889
Ride 'em, cowboy. Make me proud.

320
00:32:06,596 --> 00:32:07,430
Nat!

321
00:32:08,765 --> 00:32:09,933
What's going on?

322
00:32:10,183 --> 00:32:11,852
We got a friend on the track.

323
00:32:12,143 --> 00:32:13,812
That creep from Chinatown.

324
00:32:14,062 --> 00:32:14,980
Creepy Thin Man.

325
00:32:27,659 --> 00:32:29,995
It's a round track.
He's not going anywhere.

326
00:32:54,436 --> 00:32:56,062
She's going after him.

327
00:34:23,024 --> 00:34:26,987
The micro camera has allowed us
to study Red Star's layout.

328
00:34:27,279 --> 00:34:30,115
The mainframe is right behind
that door.

329
00:34:30,448 --> 00:34:34,619
That's where my software would be,
but the security looks incredible.

330
00:34:35,287 --> 00:34:36,746
-Restricted access.
-Fingerprint I.D.

331
00:34:36,955 --> 00:34:38,164
Retinal scanner.

332
00:34:38,623 --> 00:34:40,625
Angels, break it down.

333
00:34:40,959 --> 00:34:43,795
Only two Red Star directors
can access the mainframe.

334
00:34:44,129 --> 00:34:48,175
To gain access, they have
to synchronize their entrance.

335
00:34:50,802 --> 00:34:54,306
A gelatin scanning plate
takes exact fingerprints.

336
00:34:54,806 --> 00:34:58,476
A laser accurate to .009 millimeters
scans the retina.

337
00:35:02,647 --> 00:35:07,652
It is accessible only through
a monitored airless antechamber.

338
00:35:10,113 --> 00:35:15,035
There's only one way to get through
undetected: Be invisible.

339
00:35:20,165 --> 00:35:22,501
The floor is rigged
with pressure sensitivity.

340
00:35:22,751 --> 00:35:26,213
Any contact exceeding .25 seconds
triggers the alarm.

341
00:35:28,924 --> 00:35:30,258
Sounds impossible.

342
00:35:31,176 --> 00:35:32,844
Sounds like fun.

343
00:35:43,396 --> 00:35:46,066
Director 1

344
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:38,994
Director 2

345
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:47,419
Mein Siegenbock ist sexy!

346
00:36:52,591 --> 00:36:54,593
They got the wrong address.

347
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,796
You ready to whip them into shape,
Alex?

348
00:37:47,979 --> 00:37:50,398
You must be Miss Aarons. I'm Doris.

349
00:37:51,816 --> 00:37:53,151
Sorry about the confusion.

350
00:37:53,401 --> 00:37:57,405
I had you scheduled for next week.
I don't know what happened.

351
00:37:58,406 --> 00:38:00,242
That's what I'm here to find out.

352
00:38:00,659 --> 00:38:02,577
You are the efficiency expert.

353
00:38:02,827 --> 00:38:04,162
Yes.

354
00:38:04,829 --> 00:38:06,164
I am.

355
00:38:07,332 --> 00:38:08,250
Bitch.

356
00:38:08,667 --> 00:38:10,502
I heard that.

357
00:38:18,844 --> 00:38:22,681
Your methodologies are antiquated
and weak.

358
00:38:23,014 --> 00:38:27,352
Your procedures of approval ensure
that only the least radical ideas...

359
00:38:28,186 --> 00:38:29,521
...are rewarded.

360
00:38:29,855 --> 00:38:33,024
Meanwhile, your competition is
innovating!

361
00:38:36,194 --> 00:38:37,362
Ow.

362
00:38:40,198 --> 00:38:41,366
You.

363
00:38:42,868 --> 00:38:45,287
What was the last
suggestion you made?

364
00:38:46,872 --> 00:38:48,874
To make the Coke machine free.

365
00:38:49,124 --> 00:38:50,208
Why?

366
00:38:50,542 --> 00:38:52,544
Caffeine helps us program.

367
00:38:55,881 --> 00:38:58,049
Perfect. Smart...

368
00:38:58,717 --> 00:39:01,386
...simple and logical.

369
00:39:03,054 --> 00:39:04,472
What did your boss say?

370
00:39:06,224 --> 00:39:07,893
He said no.

371
00:39:09,728 --> 00:39:11,062
Question!

372
00:39:11,479 --> 00:39:13,315
Who builds this company's products?

373
00:39:14,649 --> 00:39:16,067
You do.

374
00:39:18,236 --> 00:39:20,238
Engineers do.

375
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:23,742
Not managers.

376
00:39:25,076 --> 00:39:29,414
They should be answering to you,
not you to them!

377
00:39:30,582 --> 00:39:33,919
Who else has an idea
like this man's Coke machine?

378
00:39:34,419 --> 00:39:36,588
All right! Tell me.

379
00:39:37,339 --> 00:39:38,673
Better yet...

380
00:39:39,591 --> 00:39:42,093
...can anyone show me?

381
00:39:44,679 --> 00:39:48,266
Red Star Mainframe Level 4

382
00:40:34,771 --> 00:40:35,856
It's not working.

383
00:41:08,972 --> 00:41:13,727
There 's only one way to get through
undetected: Be invisible.

384
00:41:28,742 --> 00:41:31,161
The floor is rigged
with pressure sensitivity.

385
00:41:31,411 --> 00:41:35,498
Any contact which exceeds .25 seconds
will trigger the alarm.

386
00:41:57,604 --> 00:41:58,939
Thank you, sir.

387
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:17,123
I hope you don't mind
if we look around.

388
00:42:43,817 --> 00:42:46,820
So we have complete access
to Red Star's computer.

389
00:42:47,153 --> 00:42:49,823
And they have no idea
we can peek inside.

390
00:42:50,073 --> 00:42:52,325
You guys are tremendous. Thanks.

391
00:42:53,827 --> 00:42:58,665
I need evidence of Knox Technologies
software in the Red Star system.

392
00:42:58,915 --> 00:43:02,335
-Where is it?
-Bosley has it in the laptop.

393
00:43:02,586 --> 00:43:05,338
It has a direct link
to the Red Star mainframe.

394
00:43:05,755 --> 00:43:06,756
Bosley?

395
00:43:08,008 --> 00:43:11,011
Maybe we should be doing
our own analysis.

396
00:43:11,344 --> 00:43:14,514
Surely Eric would be
the best person to--

397
00:43:14,848 --> 00:43:18,685
Our goal was to learn if Red Star
had stolen your software.

398
00:43:18,935 --> 00:43:22,105
It would be unethical
to let you access their systems.

399
00:43:22,355 --> 00:43:24,357
If we get proof, we'll tell you.

400
00:43:24,608 --> 00:43:27,277
That makes sense.
That's cool. Right?

401
00:43:27,861 --> 00:43:29,196
Right, Viv?

402
00:43:30,989 --> 00:43:33,909
You know, Knox may not be
out of danger yet.

403
00:43:34,117 --> 00:43:36,077
Smile. Don't panic the client.

404
00:43:36,286 --> 00:43:40,457
One of us should check
security at his house.

405
00:43:40,749 --> 00:43:42,501
Absolutely. I agree.

406
00:43:48,215 --> 00:43:50,383
-Everything okay?
-Yeah. Nothing up here.

407
00:43:54,721 --> 00:43:57,057
Wow, that was cool.

408
00:43:58,850 --> 00:44:00,352
Who's the Green Beret?

409
00:44:01,228 --> 00:44:02,395
My dad.

410
00:44:02,729 --> 00:44:04,064
That's nice.

411
00:44:07,234 --> 00:44:08,902
That's the guy who killed him.

412
00:44:12,739 --> 00:44:16,409
Yeah. They were
in Army Intelligence together.

413
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:19,412
This was his best friend
and he turned on him.

414
00:44:21,081 --> 00:44:22,582
I'm sorry.

415
00:44:22,916 --> 00:44:24,084
Thanks.

416
00:44:24,918 --> 00:44:26,503
Why do you keep it?

417
00:44:26,753 --> 00:44:31,758
To remind me: Be careful who you
trust. Don't take any wooden nickels.

418
00:44:32,592 --> 00:44:35,595
What about you?
Did you ever have parents?

419
00:44:35,929 --> 00:44:38,932
I mean-- I know you have parents,
but I mean--

420
00:44:39,432 --> 00:44:40,934
Where's your mom?

421
00:44:41,685 --> 00:44:44,855
She died when I was 6,
and I never met my father.

422
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,442
You never met your father?

423
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:51,862
Now you work for...

424
00:44:53,613 --> 00:44:56,116
...a man you've never seen.

425
00:44:56,616 --> 00:44:59,119
That's an interesting trend.

426
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:01,621
That was smooth.

427
00:45:01,955 --> 00:45:03,790
Want to play Scrabble?

428
00:45:04,624 --> 00:45:07,294
Don't worry about it.
I got somebody--

429
00:45:07,627 --> 00:45:09,296
That's okay.

430
00:45:09,629 --> 00:45:11,798
What are they called? You know....

431
00:45:19,806 --> 00:45:21,975
So, okay.

432
00:45:23,643 --> 00:45:25,478
-This is a panic button.
-Okay.

433
00:45:27,314 --> 00:45:30,817
If you just press it,
then any one of us...

434
00:45:31,067 --> 00:45:34,821
...whoever's closest, will be here
if there's any problem.

435
00:45:35,071 --> 00:45:38,408
Like that? Okay.
Right now, that would be you.

436
00:45:38,658 --> 00:45:40,660
But you don't have a problem.

437
00:45:40,994 --> 00:45:42,662
Yeah, I do.

438
00:45:46,333 --> 00:45:47,667
I don't know...

439
00:45:48,835 --> 00:45:50,670
...how to make chicken.

440
00:45:53,673 --> 00:45:54,674
Scrabble?

441
00:45:55,091 --> 00:45:56,259
Shake 'N Bake?

442
00:45:56,510 --> 00:45:58,178
I'll shake, you bake?

443
00:46:13,026 --> 00:46:14,694
I want to shake.

444
00:46:18,698 --> 00:46:20,367
-Hey, Pete.
-How's it going?

445
00:46:20,617 --> 00:46:24,287
-Good. How are you?
-Good. It's good to see you.

446
00:46:24,704 --> 00:46:27,207
-You want your ticket?
-All right!

447
00:46:29,543 --> 00:46:32,546
-Thanks for giving me a chance.
-l wanted to see you.

448
00:46:32,879 --> 00:46:34,214
-Really?
-Yeah.

449
00:46:34,548 --> 00:46:36,716
-You look great.
-Thank you.

450
00:46:37,968 --> 00:46:39,803
I've thought a lot about us.

451
00:46:40,053 --> 00:46:43,390
No, no, no.
I know you have something to say...

452
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:45,976
...but I have something to say too.

453
00:46:46,226 --> 00:46:50,063
I've been thinking a lot about you
and me and, well, us.

454
00:46:50,397 --> 00:46:54,901
And I know that we have these crazy
lives, but I can't help it.

455
00:46:55,402 --> 00:46:57,070
I love you.

456
00:46:59,239 --> 00:47:03,243
Searching Red Star mainframe
for Knox Technologies software.

457
00:47:03,577 --> 00:47:05,245
Software not detected.

458
00:47:07,414 --> 00:47:08,748
Coming.

459
00:47:13,086 --> 00:47:14,087
Hello.

460
00:47:14,296 --> 00:47:16,256
Trick or treat for UNICEF.

461
00:47:23,096 --> 00:47:25,599
That's a very nice costume,
young lady.

462
00:47:25,932 --> 00:47:27,934
It glows in the dark.

463
00:47:29,686 --> 00:47:30,770
I hope you like to dance.

464
00:47:31,021 --> 00:47:33,607
Are you kidding? I love to dance!

465
00:47:43,283 --> 00:47:45,285
You. You want to dance on-stage?

466
00:47:45,702 --> 00:47:46,703
Us?

467
00:47:46,953 --> 00:47:47,871
Yes!

468
00:47:48,121 --> 00:47:50,123
No, the stage is for the ladies.

469
00:47:50,457 --> 00:47:53,460
Oh, never mind. I'll just find
a spot on the floor.

470
00:47:53,793 --> 00:47:55,128
No, no, wait.

471
00:47:55,378 --> 00:47:57,714
This is Soul Train's highest honor.

472
00:47:57,964 --> 00:48:01,051
I won't let you not go up there.
Yeah, she'll go.

473
00:48:01,301 --> 00:48:04,137
Really? I've always wanted
to go up there!

474
00:48:04,471 --> 00:48:05,805
Have a great time.

475
00:48:06,139 --> 00:48:08,141
Okay. I'll be back.

476
00:48:09,809 --> 00:48:13,813
Ms. Wood, there are some lines
that I never cross.

477
00:48:14,147 --> 00:48:15,899
Lines have never stopped me.

478
00:48:16,483 --> 00:48:18,652
It's "Miss." And it's "Vivian."

479
00:48:18,985 --> 00:48:20,820
Okay. Miss Vivian.

480
00:48:22,489 --> 00:48:24,991
Okay, Miss Vivian. You're a pro.

481
00:48:25,325 --> 00:48:28,995
I mean, you're not a pro,
but you're an executive.

482
00:48:29,663 --> 00:48:32,499
We must keep our relationship
professional.

483
00:48:32,832 --> 00:48:34,334
May l?

484
00:48:36,336 --> 00:48:38,004
I'll get you a glass.

485
00:49:16,877 --> 00:49:19,212
She's pretty great, isn't she?

486
00:49:29,222 --> 00:49:31,558
I said, she's pretty great, right?

487
00:49:45,739 --> 00:49:48,074
You guys are in really good shape.

488
00:49:48,408 --> 00:49:50,577
Definitely. Definitely.

489
00:49:55,582 --> 00:49:57,584
All right. The Robot!

490
00:49:57,918 --> 00:50:01,254
Go, white girl!
Go, white girl!

491
00:50:01,671 --> 00:50:05,175
That's old school, right? Definitely.

492
00:50:06,426 --> 00:50:08,512
I'm Pete. How are you?

493
00:50:13,934 --> 00:50:15,352
The Running Man! Look!

494
00:50:24,110 --> 00:50:26,279
Incredible! It was great!

495
00:50:26,530 --> 00:50:29,533
I'm having so much fun!
This is so exciting!

496
00:50:29,783 --> 00:50:31,868
You know, I have to go number one.

497
00:50:36,039 --> 00:50:37,123
Look...

498
00:50:38,625 --> 00:50:40,627
...what I'm trying to say is...

499
00:50:42,963 --> 00:50:44,631
...will you marry me?

500
00:50:47,467 --> 00:50:49,636
Oh, no, baby! Baby?!

501
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:52,806
Baby?! God, no.

502
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:55,809
Damn you, Salazar.

503
00:50:56,142 --> 00:50:58,979
Damn you, Salazar!

504
00:50:59,646 --> 00:51:00,981
Cut!

505
00:51:01,231 --> 00:51:03,650
Was that over the top?
It felt over the top.

506
00:51:03,984 --> 00:51:08,238
No. That is the best shot, the best
scene, the best movie on the planet!

507
00:51:18,790 --> 00:51:19,958
Hi.

508
00:51:20,542 --> 00:51:22,878
How was your day? Great.

509
00:51:23,628 --> 00:51:28,300
You know how superheroes have these
secret identities, where they--

510
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,552
No. No superheroes.

511
00:51:33,638 --> 00:51:37,309
You're an action star.
I get a lot of action.

512
00:51:38,643 --> 00:51:40,812
That is so lame.

513
00:51:41,730 --> 00:51:43,398
Hey, girls, you having fun?

514
00:51:43,648 --> 00:51:45,650
I'm having so much fun
I could just die.

515
00:51:45,984 --> 00:51:49,112
Jason, I'm one-third of an elite
crime-fighting team...

516
00:51:49,738 --> 00:51:51,907
...backed by an anonymous millionaire.

517
00:51:53,325 --> 00:51:55,327
Yes, that's it.

518
00:52:08,507 --> 00:52:10,342
What are you doing here?

519
00:52:19,601 --> 00:52:20,602
Perfect.

520
00:52:58,974 --> 00:53:00,809
Come on! Go! Hit it!

521
00:53:11,069 --> 00:53:12,904
Murphy O'Meyer...

522
00:53:13,738 --> 00:53:15,073
...that does it.

523
00:53:15,323 --> 00:53:16,658
Who sent you?

524
00:53:18,743 --> 00:53:19,911
Who?!

525
00:53:22,914 --> 00:53:24,583
Woo-- Woo--

526
00:53:24,916 --> 00:53:26,585
-Who?
-Woo--

527
00:53:29,254 --> 00:53:31,590
-Vivian--
-Spit it out!

528
00:53:32,257 --> 00:53:33,258
Vivian Wood!

529
00:53:36,761 --> 00:53:38,180
You bitch.

530
00:53:44,436 --> 00:53:46,104
I love a fire.

531
00:54:11,546 --> 00:54:12,380
Hey.

532
00:54:13,465 --> 00:54:15,133
Oh, my God! You're hit!

533
00:54:15,467 --> 00:54:19,554
No. I mean, the squibs hurt a bit
when they go off, but I'm fine.

534
00:54:19,804 --> 00:54:21,473
What happened to my trailer?

535
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:23,808
I haven't been honest with you.

536
00:54:24,059 --> 00:54:27,229
Were you in there when that happened?
Look at it.

537
00:54:27,479 --> 00:54:29,064
I'm not a bikini waxer.

538
00:54:32,317 --> 00:54:36,821
Bummer. I mean, that was
kind of a turn-on.

539
00:54:46,081 --> 00:54:47,249
I have to go.

540
00:54:47,666 --> 00:54:49,334
-Charlie?
-Yeah.

541
00:54:50,168 --> 00:54:53,004
I have to go,
but will you call me tomorrow?

542
00:54:53,255 --> 00:54:55,507
-Of course.
-Great. Thanks.

543
00:55:01,471 --> 00:55:02,556
Excuse me.

544
00:55:05,350 --> 00:55:07,018
You're bad.

545
00:55:10,021 --> 00:55:13,024
Guys, finally you warm up a bit.

546
00:55:14,025 --> 00:55:18,363
Dylan? It's Nat. Vivian Wood
is a fake and an all-around bitch.

547
00:55:18,697 --> 00:55:22,033
Her assassin just paid me a visit.
We gotta warn Knox.

548
00:55:22,534 --> 00:55:24,202
I'm at his house now.

549
00:55:24,536 --> 00:55:25,871
You are?

550
00:55:26,788 --> 00:55:28,123
You know what?

551
00:55:28,373 --> 00:55:30,876
Call Alex and meet me at the agency.

552
00:55:33,879 --> 00:55:36,047
Dylan! Shit.

553
00:55:42,721 --> 00:55:45,724
Don't stand next to the window,
it's not safe.

554
00:55:46,391 --> 00:55:47,726
Toga.

555
00:55:51,897 --> 00:55:55,233
Listen, I just found out that--
Who's that?

556
00:55:57,235 --> 00:55:58,904
Working undercover?

557
00:55:59,404 --> 00:56:02,240
It's a full-service job.

558
00:56:03,575 --> 00:56:04,910
I'll bet.

559
00:56:05,410 --> 00:56:08,747
I can see by your "gown"
that you're unarmed.

560
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:12,751
Some maniac could just stroll in
and blow you both to bits.

561
00:56:13,001 --> 00:56:17,923
Viv, you're obsessed. All work
and no play makes Viv a dull girl.

562
00:56:18,256 --> 00:56:21,760
I have to tie up some loose ends here,
so take a seat.

563
00:56:22,677 --> 00:56:24,429
Want some champagne?

564
00:56:31,269 --> 00:56:32,687
"Enemy."

565
00:56:37,275 --> 00:56:38,610
I know.

566
00:56:48,286 --> 00:56:50,121
Sad news.

567
00:56:50,455 --> 00:56:52,123
Your girlfriends are dead.

568
00:56:52,457 --> 00:56:53,792
And Corwin?

569
00:57:16,731 --> 00:57:19,568
I don't think it's gonna work out,
you and me.

570
00:57:19,818 --> 00:57:22,988
Which is a real bummer,
since you, Dylan...

571
00:57:23,321 --> 00:57:26,157
...are a tomcat in the sack.

572
00:57:28,493 --> 00:57:32,998
Let me get this straight. You're a
woman. Women have natural intuition.

573
00:57:33,248 --> 00:57:38,086
And you're a detective. And you had
no idea that this was going to happen?

574
00:57:39,004 --> 00:57:41,006
-l knew.
-She knew.

575
00:57:41,339 --> 00:57:43,175
And I know what'll happen next.

576
00:57:43,425 --> 00:57:44,759
Tell her, baby.

577
00:57:47,012 --> 00:57:50,182
All the Angels are going to heaven.

578
00:57:50,515 --> 00:57:51,683
And Bosley?

579
00:57:51,933 --> 00:57:54,603
We'll keep him. We like him.
And his computer.

580
00:57:54,936 --> 00:57:56,271
He's special.

581
00:57:59,608 --> 00:58:01,610
Corwin had nothing to do with this.

582
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:04,863
No. But I never really liked him.

583
00:58:05,197 --> 00:58:08,116
-And the kidnapping was a setup.
-Afraid so.

584
00:58:08,366 --> 00:58:09,868
And Red Star was a setup.

585
00:58:10,118 --> 00:58:13,705
You got it all figured out.
Any other questions?

586
00:58:14,039 --> 00:58:15,040
Why?

587
00:58:17,375 --> 00:58:18,710
Ask your boss.

588
00:58:19,878 --> 00:58:21,213
Charlie?

589
00:58:23,048 --> 00:58:24,299
You're after Charlie.

590
00:58:25,967 --> 00:58:28,053
Charlie, Charlie, Charlie.

591
00:58:30,555 --> 00:58:33,058
They say that in death...

592
00:58:33,391 --> 00:58:36,228
...all life's questions are answered.

593
00:58:37,395 --> 00:58:38,980
Will you let me know?

594
00:58:46,321 --> 00:58:47,989
Let's go get Charlie.

595
00:58:52,911 --> 00:58:54,079
Come on.

596
00:59:07,008 --> 00:59:08,009
Are you all right?

597
00:59:08,218 --> 00:59:10,011
-What's going on?
-Something's going on.

598
00:59:10,220 --> 00:59:11,179
Where's Dylan?

599
00:59:24,276 --> 00:59:29,281
They say in death,
all life's questions are answered.

600
00:59:30,949 --> 00:59:32,450
Will you let me know?

601
01:00:04,149 --> 01:00:06,985
What are we doing?
House of Pancakes? Sizzler?

602
01:00:07,319 --> 01:00:09,988
You are the cheapest man
on the planet.

603
01:00:23,835 --> 01:00:25,337
What did it look like?

604
01:00:25,670 --> 01:00:30,342
Oh, I don't know. It was, like,
all cool and stuff.

605
01:00:31,092 --> 01:00:32,511
You've never seen a booby.

606
01:00:32,761 --> 01:00:34,095
-Have too.
-Have not.

607
01:00:34,346 --> 01:00:36,681
-I've seen lots of boobies.
-Yeah, right.

608
01:00:40,185 --> 01:00:42,020
A little help?

609
01:00:56,284 --> 01:00:57,452
Don't ask.

610
01:00:57,702 --> 01:00:59,704
Where's Knox? Is he okay?

611
01:01:00,038 --> 01:01:02,541
Oh, he's great. He's the bad guy.

612
01:01:03,708 --> 01:01:06,711
The kidnapping was a setup.
He's behind it all.

613
01:01:06,962 --> 01:01:08,630
What? Why?

614
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:12,884
He wasn't exactly forthcoming
when he shot me out the window.

615
01:01:24,479 --> 01:01:25,647
Bosley!

616
01:01:25,897 --> 01:01:28,733
He's safe! Knox already has him.

617
01:01:31,570 --> 01:01:32,904
Wait a minute.

618
01:01:33,738 --> 01:01:35,490
Let me get this straight.

619
01:01:36,741 --> 01:01:38,076
Bosley's with the man...

620
01:01:38,910 --> 01:01:40,996
...who tried to kill us. That's safe?

621
01:01:41,246 --> 01:01:44,416
He won't kill Bosley
until he kills Charlie.

622
01:01:45,250 --> 01:01:46,751
Kills Charlie?

623
01:01:49,254 --> 01:01:50,589
Oh, Jesus.

624
01:01:50,922 --> 01:01:55,594
I don't know what his plan is,
but I know that we can stop him.

625
01:02:05,020 --> 01:02:08,148
If Knox thinks we're dead,
why blow up the agency?

626
01:02:08,315 --> 01:02:09,858
Why does he want Charlie?

627
01:02:10,108 --> 01:02:12,861
We do know that he wanted us
to break into Red Star.

628
01:02:14,279 --> 01:02:17,616
Imagine how dangerous this would be
in the wrong hands.

629
01:02:17,866 --> 01:02:22,037
Knox used us to access the mainframe
not to get back his software...

630
01:02:22,287 --> 01:02:24,956
...but for control of their global
positioning satellites.

631
01:02:25,207 --> 01:02:29,044
Knox's software can match Charlie's
voice over the phone.

632
01:02:29,294 --> 01:02:31,963
And use Red Star satellites
to track him.

633
01:02:32,214 --> 01:02:35,717
But why would Knox go to so much
trouble to find Charlie?

634
01:02:36,801 --> 01:02:38,803
That's the guy who killed him.

635
01:02:40,305 --> 01:02:42,807
They were in Army Intelligence
together.

636
01:02:43,058 --> 01:02:44,893
His best friend turned on him.

637
01:02:46,728 --> 01:02:49,064
Knox thinks Charlie killed his father.

638
01:02:49,981 --> 01:02:52,484
So if he can intercept
Charlie's call...

639
01:02:52,817 --> 01:02:54,319
...he can locate him.

640
01:02:54,569 --> 01:02:57,739
But Knox has to get Charlie
on the phone first.

641
01:02:57,989 --> 01:03:02,410
-But the only one Charlie calls is--
-Bosley.

642
01:03:28,854 --> 01:03:31,857
May I have some ice water, please?

643
01:03:54,379 --> 01:03:57,048
Fly to me, Angels! Please come!

644
01:03:57,382 --> 01:03:59,718
Please fly to me, Angels!

645
01:04:01,219 --> 01:04:04,556
I had a long talk with a squirrel once.

646
01:04:04,806 --> 01:04:06,975
Longer than I've talked to most humans.

647
01:04:30,415 --> 01:04:31,750
Hello?

648
01:04:32,918 --> 01:04:34,252
Hello?

649
01:04:35,420 --> 01:04:37,756
Hello. Hello out there.

650
01:04:38,089 --> 01:04:39,674
Any sign of Bosley's laptop?

651
01:04:39,925 --> 01:04:41,343
They must have taken it.

652
01:04:41,593 --> 01:04:44,095
-We should check Knox's place.
-Let's go.

653
01:04:44,346 --> 01:04:45,347
I'll drive.

654
01:04:45,597 --> 01:04:47,766
Angels?! Angels, help me!

655
01:04:48,099 --> 01:04:49,100
Bosley?

656
01:04:49,434 --> 01:04:50,769
Angels!

657
01:04:51,102 --> 01:04:55,273
We begin our broadcast day!
Come and get me, girls!

658
01:04:55,774 --> 01:05:00,111
If you can follow the sound
of my voice, then draw some...

659
01:05:00,445 --> 01:05:01,863
...triangles or something...

660
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:05,116
...to get to this
location and save me!

661
01:05:05,367 --> 01:05:07,285
Is there a way to trace him?

662
01:05:07,786 --> 01:05:10,872
Even with our equipment,
he'd have to be within 20 miles.

663
01:05:11,122 --> 01:05:14,125
The place I'm in looks
like Cher's bedroom.

664
01:05:14,459 --> 01:05:16,461
And it stinks.

665
01:05:18,296 --> 01:05:19,965
Tell us where you are.

666
01:05:20,298 --> 01:05:22,050
It smells like the ocean.

667
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:25,637
And if I look out the window,
I see the ocean.

668
01:05:25,887 --> 01:05:28,390
He could be anywhere
this half of North America.

669
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:29,641
Jack...

670
01:05:30,308 --> 01:05:31,810
...tell them where I am.

671
01:05:34,813 --> 01:05:35,814
What?

672
01:05:37,899 --> 01:05:40,068
It's a Sitta pygmaea!

673
01:05:40,986 --> 01:05:42,320
A pygmy nuthatch!

674
01:05:42,654 --> 01:05:44,990
They only live in one place!

675
01:05:45,657 --> 01:05:46,658
Carmel!

676
01:05:46,992 --> 01:05:49,494
I can't tell you anything else,
except...

677
01:05:50,328 --> 01:05:53,999
...this feels like the first day
of the last of my life.

678
01:05:54,332 --> 01:05:58,253
Or the last day of the first
of my life, or something.

679
01:06:00,338 --> 01:06:03,425
I have a lighthouse, two hotels,
seven manor houses...

680
01:06:03,675 --> 01:06:08,680
...one owned by the National Parks,
one by Nick Xero Corporation--

681
01:06:09,014 --> 01:06:12,184
-Is that spelled with an "X" or a "Z"?
-"X."

682
01:06:12,517 --> 01:06:13,518
It's an anagram.

683
01:06:14,436 --> 01:06:16,438
Rearranged, it's "Eric Knox."

684
01:06:17,689 --> 01:06:19,191
Scrabble freak.

685
01:06:19,441 --> 01:06:21,693
An old tunnel leads down to the shore.

686
01:06:21,943 --> 01:06:26,364
A sea approach is the best way to get
in undetected. We'll need a boat.

687
01:06:26,615 --> 01:06:29,034
And a cover.
We can't use the speedboat.

688
01:06:33,205 --> 01:06:35,040
Head to the marina.

689
01:07:29,594 --> 01:07:32,514
Chad, does this thing go any faster?

690
01:07:32,764 --> 01:07:36,434
We're in a hurry, and I could
open it up if you let me drive.

691
01:07:36,768 --> 01:07:41,773
I'm sorry, friend of Starfish. There's
only one captain of this love boat.

692
01:07:42,607 --> 01:07:44,442
That captain is me...

693
01:07:44,943 --> 01:07:46,528
...the Chad.

694
01:07:46,945 --> 01:07:48,280
The Chad.

695
01:07:48,613 --> 01:07:51,116
Chad, captain of the love boat.

696
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:52,701
The Chad.

697
01:07:52,951 --> 01:07:54,536
We're kind of in a hurry.

698
01:07:56,121 --> 01:07:57,622
I'm the Chad.

699
01:08:10,552 --> 01:08:14,806
Knox Technologies voice identification
software download confirmed.

700
01:08:26,651 --> 01:08:30,655
Red Star satellite network uplink
confirmed.

701
01:08:37,829 --> 01:08:39,497
Revenge is fun.

702
01:08:42,292 --> 01:08:44,669
I have to say, Starfish,
I am honored...

703
01:08:45,003 --> 01:08:49,758
...that you've taken an interest in my
work. And I think you're very pretty.

704
01:08:50,175 --> 01:08:51,510
Starfish?

705
01:08:52,177 --> 01:08:53,678
Where are you going?

706
01:08:55,013 --> 01:08:58,350
Starfish, are you going swimming?
Where are you going?

707
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:00,018
Where are you going again?

708
01:09:00,268 --> 01:09:01,603
Starfish?

709
01:09:03,939 --> 01:09:05,273
Was it the Chad?

710
01:09:10,028 --> 01:09:13,031
No! The Chad was great!

711
01:09:17,953 --> 01:09:19,663
The Chad was great.

712
01:09:57,868 --> 01:09:59,953
I'll tap the signal from the roof.

713
01:10:00,328 --> 01:10:03,665
-I'll deal with Knox.
-I'll bring our Bosley back.

714
01:10:25,937 --> 01:10:28,273
"I don't know how to make chicken."

715
01:10:28,523 --> 01:10:29,816
Jerk.

716
01:11:05,352 --> 01:11:06,186
Dylan.

717
01:11:06,686 --> 01:11:09,022
Thank God you're alive.

718
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:12,609
You know my better half.

719
01:11:12,817 --> 01:11:17,614
It figures I'd meet the perfect guy
and he'd already have a perfect girl.

720
01:11:46,768 --> 01:11:48,228
Hello, blondie.

721
01:11:48,603 --> 01:11:50,230
Her girlfriend's here.

722
01:11:51,606 --> 01:11:54,734
Jimmy, Paulie, go secure Bosley,
would you?

723
01:11:55,443 --> 01:11:57,737
Like now, now, now, now.

724
01:12:02,617 --> 01:12:03,910
Bos?

725
01:12:04,452 --> 01:12:06,580
-Bosley?
-Natalie?

726
01:12:07,289 --> 01:12:08,915
Natalie, is that you?

727
01:12:09,291 --> 01:12:11,084
Behind this door.

728
01:12:12,961 --> 01:12:15,589
Bosley, I'm so happy to see you!

729
01:12:16,798 --> 01:12:18,758
We're all here. I'll get you out.

730
01:12:26,474 --> 01:12:27,767
Red wire.

731
01:12:28,476 --> 01:12:29,769
Blue wire.

732
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:34,774
GPS phone tap.

733
01:12:37,652 --> 01:12:39,446
Pygmy nuthatch.

734
01:12:41,489 --> 01:12:44,117
-I'm getting tickled.
-Who's calling now?

735
01:12:44,910 --> 01:12:45,785
It's Pete!

736
01:12:46,995 --> 01:12:48,288
Hello?

737
01:12:48,663 --> 01:12:50,624
Hi, Pete. How are you?

738
01:12:50,916 --> 01:12:53,335
Good. You said you wanted me to call.

739
01:12:53,585 --> 01:12:56,505
I did want you to call.
I mean, I do want you to.

740
01:12:56,755 --> 01:12:58,298
Ask if he can call you back.

741
01:12:58,673 --> 01:13:00,467
I'm so happy to hear from you.

742
01:13:00,759 --> 01:13:04,095
I wanted to talk.
I like spending time with you.

743
01:13:04,346 --> 01:13:07,807
I'd like to see more of you,
maybe in a continuous block.

744
01:13:08,099 --> 01:13:11,770
I know. It's just been crazy
this week at work.

745
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:13,313
Watch your back!

746
01:13:17,526 --> 01:13:18,610
Use the sleeper.

747
01:13:22,697 --> 01:13:25,492
Never send a man to do a woman's job.

748
01:13:28,370 --> 01:13:31,206
-Nice work, Natalie.
-Thanks, Bosley.

749
01:13:32,541 --> 01:13:34,167
Pete? Hi.

750
01:13:35,377 --> 01:13:38,672
You know, under different
circumstances...

751
01:13:38,964 --> 01:13:41,132
...we'd have made a great couple.

752
01:13:41,383 --> 01:13:45,804
If you hadn't shot me out a window
and tried to kill everyone I love...

753
01:13:46,054 --> 01:13:47,681
...we could have had a chance.

754
01:13:47,889 --> 01:13:50,350
Can you keep a secret?

755
01:13:51,893 --> 01:13:53,854
I mean, you can't tell anyone.

756
01:13:54,145 --> 01:13:55,814
That you're disgusting?

757
01:13:58,733 --> 01:14:01,528
You have the fullest, sweetest...

758
01:14:03,238 --> 01:14:04,865
...most luscious...

759
01:14:06,074 --> 01:14:08,034
...lips I have ever...

760
01:14:08,910 --> 01:14:10,203
...kissed.

761
01:14:13,248 --> 01:14:15,709
I just gotta take this call.

762
01:14:20,422 --> 01:14:23,258
Nine o'clock, Charlie. Right on time.

763
01:14:26,511 --> 01:14:28,722
Enter. Come on.

764
01:14:37,355 --> 01:14:39,691
Mr. Bosley's phone,
Eric Knox speaking.

765
01:14:39,941 --> 01:14:42,360
Mr. Knox? This is Charles Townsend.

766
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:51,870
I'm delighted the Angels helped you.
Are you in the office?

767
01:14:55,373 --> 01:14:57,709
Hang up, Charlie.
He's almost got you.

768
01:14:57,918 --> 01:15:01,379
We're all at the beach,
having mimosas. Can you join us?

769
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:05,467
I'll take a rain check, Eric.
Is Bosley there?

770
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:08,553
He went to the men's room.
He'll be right back.

771
01:15:10,138 --> 01:15:11,932
No, wait. He's coming.

772
01:15:12,307 --> 01:15:13,600
Bosley?

773
01:15:19,314 --> 01:15:21,107
Okay, here we go.

774
01:15:32,327 --> 01:15:35,288
That's not him. Sorry.

775
01:15:35,580 --> 01:15:37,624
Can you hold on one second longer?

776
01:15:38,166 --> 01:15:39,417
Not a problem.

777
01:15:42,254 --> 01:15:44,256
Pete? Can you hold on a second?

778
01:15:44,548 --> 01:15:45,549
Sure.

779
01:15:46,007 --> 01:15:48,134
I like him so much.

780
01:15:58,520 --> 01:15:59,312
Hey, Bos.

781
01:16:01,565 --> 01:16:02,732
Bosley?

782
01:16:04,234 --> 01:16:05,569
He's coming, sir.

783
01:16:32,095 --> 01:16:33,763
Sorry, not him.

784
01:16:34,764 --> 01:16:36,516
Can I take a message?

785
01:16:37,225 --> 01:16:39,186
Just tell him I called, as planned.

786
01:16:46,276 --> 01:16:47,611
Gotcha.

787
01:17:13,136 --> 01:17:14,471
Just one more sec.

788
01:17:14,763 --> 01:17:16,723
Is this a bad time?

789
01:17:17,807 --> 01:17:19,976
You seem a little distracted.

790
01:17:25,649 --> 01:17:27,317
Is this the famous Charlie?

791
01:17:27,651 --> 01:17:29,319
No, this is Pete.

792
01:17:31,905 --> 01:17:34,115
Hey! I like that guy!

793
01:17:44,459 --> 01:17:46,920
That man's got a beautiful
telephone voice.

794
01:17:49,464 --> 01:17:51,967
That's one more daddy
you'll never know.

795
01:17:55,804 --> 01:17:56,972
Bad news.

796
01:17:57,472 --> 01:17:59,307
I have to leave.

797
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:03,103
I gotta go torture and kill your boss.

798
01:18:04,646 --> 01:18:06,314
Mikey, Jerry...

799
01:18:06,815 --> 01:18:08,817
...you guys like angel cake?

800
01:18:20,287 --> 01:18:23,748
Do you know how hard it is to find
a quality man in Los Angeles?

801
01:18:49,608 --> 01:18:51,943
Don't take my lighter.

802
01:19:08,126 --> 01:19:10,962
Wait, wait, wait!
I have something to tell you.

803
01:19:11,213 --> 01:19:13,215
By the time this is over...

804
01:19:13,548 --> 01:19:16,718
...all of you will be facedown
on the floor...

805
01:19:16,968 --> 01:19:18,637
...and I'll moon-walk out of here.

806
01:19:20,639 --> 01:19:22,307
You're not listening to me.

807
01:19:22,641 --> 01:19:26,144
First, you're going to help me
out of my chair.

808
01:19:26,478 --> 01:19:29,147
Then I'll leapfrog over you...

809
01:19:30,482 --> 01:19:32,651
...before I break his nose.

810
01:19:34,236 --> 01:19:35,570
Since my trusty lighter...

811
01:19:35,820 --> 01:19:39,991
...isn't working, I'll do all this
with my hands tied behind my back.

812
01:19:41,660 --> 01:19:42,827
Get her!

813
01:19:55,507 --> 01:19:57,175
King Kong palm.

814
01:20:09,187 --> 01:20:10,856
Buddha on lotus.

815
01:20:32,043 --> 01:20:35,046
And that's kicking your ass.

816
01:20:58,028 --> 01:20:58,862
Alex!

817
01:21:28,892 --> 01:21:30,393
Thanks, Bos!

818
01:22:37,294 --> 01:22:39,296
Come on, we'll miss happy hour.

819
01:22:39,629 --> 01:22:42,215
He's heading north,
just past Paradise Cove!

820
01:22:42,632 --> 01:22:45,969
Oh, boy, they found him.
That's Charlie's cabin.

821
01:22:49,598 --> 01:22:51,725
-You've seen it?
-You've seen Charlie?

822
01:22:51,975 --> 01:22:53,727
I am his trusted friend and employee.

823
01:22:53,977 --> 01:22:55,437
You've met Charlie?

824
01:22:55,645 --> 01:22:57,147
What do you mean, "met"?

825
01:22:57,439 --> 01:23:00,066
You've seen him with your own eyes.

826
01:23:01,318 --> 01:23:03,069
I saw his hand.

827
01:23:03,945 --> 01:23:05,822
It could have been anyone's hand.

828
01:23:20,337 --> 01:23:20,378
Let's see if I can win the teddy bear!

829
01:23:20,378 --> 01:23:24,090
Let's see if I can win the teddy bear!

830
01:24:33,827 --> 01:24:35,161
Sorry, Charlie.

831
01:25:20,624 --> 01:25:23,877
Get Dylan!
The missile's making a round trip!

832
01:25:37,766 --> 01:25:39,226
Dylan!

833
01:25:51,446 --> 01:25:52,614
Let's go!

834
01:26:48,378 --> 01:26:49,546
Charlie.

835
01:27:03,018 --> 01:27:04,311
You guys...

836
01:27:05,353 --> 01:27:07,314
...we're finally meeting Charlie.

837
01:27:09,191 --> 01:27:10,984
Do I look okay?

838
01:27:14,362 --> 01:27:15,822
Should we knock?

839
01:27:31,213 --> 01:27:32,506
Charlie?

840
01:27:45,393 --> 01:27:47,687
Good morning, Angels.

841
01:27:55,403 --> 01:27:57,864
Sorry I couldn't stick around.

842
01:27:59,241 --> 01:28:02,035
We're so happy you're okay, Charlie.

843
01:28:02,410 --> 01:28:07,040
I'm just fine, Angels.
Mission accomplished?

844
01:28:09,417 --> 01:28:12,045
I think the client was blown away.

845
01:28:16,091 --> 01:28:18,885
Eric Knox was born John McCadden.

846
01:28:19,261 --> 01:28:22,055
It seems his life's mission
was to bring me down.

847
01:28:22,305 --> 01:28:27,269
His dad was in my Army Intelligence
unit, working as a double agent.

848
01:28:27,477 --> 01:28:30,647
When he was discovered,
the other side killed him.

849
01:28:30,939 --> 01:28:34,067
I guess that's not
the story Knox heard.

850
01:28:35,944 --> 01:28:39,906
Charlie, I've really enjoyed
working on this assignment...

851
01:28:41,116 --> 01:28:44,244
...and I eagerly anticipate
returning to work.

852
01:28:45,662 --> 01:28:47,289
Bosley's had one too many Buddhas.

853
01:28:47,497 --> 01:28:49,499
He's definitely had a few.

854
01:28:49,791 --> 01:28:52,169
I have a team rebuilding the office.

855
01:28:52,460 --> 01:28:55,088
It'll be better than new
when you get back.

856
01:28:55,463 --> 01:28:57,424
Thank you, Charlie.

857
01:28:58,133 --> 01:29:01,428
Is there any chance
you'll be joining us, Charlie?

858
01:29:03,305 --> 01:29:05,432
I'd love to, Angels.

859
01:29:07,684 --> 01:29:11,271
But I have some precious treasures
to watch over.

860
01:29:12,147 --> 01:29:14,107
Come on, Charlie, it'll be fun.

861
01:29:14,357 --> 01:29:17,027
We're drinking from coconuts
and Buddhas.

862
01:29:19,321 --> 01:29:22,115
How will we ever know
you truly exist...

863
01:29:22,365 --> 01:29:24,951
...unless you come
have a coconut with us?

864
01:29:26,661 --> 01:29:30,290
Faith, Angels. It's called faith.

865
01:29:36,922 --> 01:29:37,881
To Charlie.

866
01:29:38,089 --> 01:29:38,882
To Charlie.

867
01:29:39,090 --> 01:29:39,925
To Charlie.

868
01:29:40,258 --> 01:29:41,760
To Charlie.

869
01:29:45,430 --> 01:29:48,433
Let me toast you ladies,
with some ice cubes!

870
01:31:05,343 --> 01:31:06,845
Safe!

871
01:31:07,554 --> 01:31:09,931
I have to go. I'm so sorry.

872
01:31:14,895 --> 01:31:17,355
I should go. I really should.

873
01:31:24,154 --> 01:31:27,490
Let's see if I can win the teddy bear!

874
01:31:58,271 --> 01:32:00,023
The Chad is great.

875
01:32:01,107 --> 01:32:03,568
He's great. He's great.

876
01:32:03,944 --> 01:32:07,781
The Chad is great. He's great.

877
01:32:10,534 --> 01:32:12,536
The Chad is great.

878
01:32:14,120 --> 01:32:16,581
The Chad is stuck.

879
01:32:27,300 --> 01:32:29,636
I'm having helmet problems.

880
01:32:31,972 --> 01:32:34,641
I'm having serious helmet problems.

881
01:32:43,650 --> 01:32:44,985
Nice!
