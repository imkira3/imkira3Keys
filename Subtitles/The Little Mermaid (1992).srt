1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:01:15,292 --> 00:01:17,878
â™ª I'll tell you a tale
of the bottomless blue â™ª

3
00:01:17,961 --> 00:01:21,081
â™ª And it's, hey
to the starboard, heave-ho â™ª

4
00:01:21,364 --> 00:01:24,427
â™ª Look out, lad
a mermaid be waiting for you â™ª

5
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:27,265
â™ª In mysterious fathoms below â™ª

6
00:01:27,307 --> 00:01:29,809
Isn't this great? The salty sea air,

7
00:01:29,851 --> 00:01:32,771
the wind blowing in your face.

8
00:01:32,812 --> 00:01:38,444
- A perfect day to be at sea.
- Oh, yes, delightful.

9
00:01:38,486 --> 00:01:41,614
A fine strong wind
and a following sea.

10
00:01:41,656 --> 00:01:44,992
King Triton must be
in a friendly type mood.

11
00:01:45,034 --> 00:01:48,746
- King Triton?
- Ruler of the Merpeople, lad.

12
00:01:48,829 --> 00:01:51,501
Thought every good sailor
knew about him.

13
00:01:51,584 --> 00:01:53,127
Merpeople.

14
00:01:53,211 --> 00:01:56,799
Eric, pay no attention
to this nautical nonsense.

15
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,510
But it ain't nonsense. It's the truth.

16
00:01:59,593 --> 00:02:04,515
I'm tellin' ya! Down in the depths
of the ocean they live! Oh!

17
00:02:04,556 --> 00:02:05,557
Aah!

18
00:02:05,641 --> 00:02:09,312
â™ª In mysterious fathoms below â™ª

19
00:03:47,176 --> 00:03:49,824
His Royal Highness,
King Triton!

20
00:03:49,876 --> 00:03:52,473
His Royal Highness,
King Triton!

21
00:04:07,322 --> 00:04:10,619
And presenting the distinguished
court composer,

22
00:04:10,661 --> 00:04:14,499
Horatio Felonious Ignacious
Crustaceous Sebastian!

23
00:04:19,504 --> 00:04:21,506
Whoa!

24
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:25,468
I'm really looking forward
to this performance, Sebastian.

25
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:28,472
Your Majesty!

26
00:04:28,514 --> 00:04:32,854
This will be the finest concert
I have ever conducted.

27
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:36,190
Your daughters,
they will be spectacular!

28
00:04:36,232 --> 00:04:38,985
Yes.

29
00:04:39,027 --> 00:04:43,365
- Especially my little Ariel.
- Yes, yes.

30
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:47,661
She has the most beautiful voice. Hmm?

31
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:50,831
If only she'd show up
for rehearsals once in a while.

32
00:05:16,653 --> 00:05:19,407
â™ª Ah, we are the daughters of Triton â™ª

33
00:05:19,491 --> 00:05:22,702
â™ª Great father who loves us
and named us well â™ª

34
00:05:22,744 --> 00:05:25,956
â™ª Aquata â™ª

35
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:28,626
â™ª Andrina â™ª

36
00:05:28,709 --> 00:05:31,712
â™ª Arista, Attina â™ª

37
00:05:31,754 --> 00:05:34,757
â™ª Adella, Alana â™ª

38
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,802
â™ª And then there is the
youngest in her musical debut â™ª

39
00:05:37,885 --> 00:05:40,723
â™ª Our seventh little sister
We're presenting her to you â™ª

40
00:05:40,765 --> 00:05:42,266
â™ª To sing a song Sebastian wrote â™ª

41
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:43,643
â™ª Her voice is like a bell â™ª

42
00:05:43,726 --> 00:05:46,939
â™ª She's our sister Ari... â™ª

43
00:05:49,422 --> 00:05:51,568
Ariel!

44
00:05:55,823 --> 00:05:58,075
Ariel, wait for me.

45
00:05:58,117 --> 00:06:00,954
Flounder, hurry up.

46
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:04,960
You know I can't swim that fast.

47
00:06:05,002 --> 00:06:08,046
There it is.

48
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:10,465
Isn't it fantastic?

49
00:06:10,507 --> 00:06:14,554
Yeah, sure. It's great.
Now let's get outta here.

50
00:06:14,637 --> 00:06:17,598
Oh! You're not getting
cold fins now, are you?

51
00:06:17,682 --> 00:06:20,643
Who, me? No way.

52
00:06:20,685 --> 00:06:24,772
It's just... It, uh...
It looks damp in there. Yeah.

53
00:06:24,814 --> 00:06:27,110
And I think I may be
coming down with something.

54
00:06:27,152 --> 00:06:30,948
Yeah, I got this cough.

55
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,534
All right. I'm going inside.

56
00:06:33,618 --> 00:06:35,786
You can just stay here
and watch for sharks.

57
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:36,954
OK.

58
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:39,248
Yeah, you go.
I'll stay and...

59
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:42,293
What? Sharks? Ariel!

60
00:06:42,376 --> 00:06:46,590
Ariel, I can't... I mean...

61
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:49,261
Ariel, help!

62
00:06:49,345 --> 00:06:52,181
- Oh, Flounder.
- Ariel.

63
00:06:52,264 --> 00:06:55,142
Do you really think there
might be sharks around here?

64
00:06:55,184 --> 00:06:57,186
Flounder, don't be such a guppy.

65
00:06:57,269 --> 00:07:00,356
I'm not a guppy.

66
00:07:01,691 --> 00:07:03,318
This is great.

67
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,321
I mean, I really love this.

68
00:07:06,363 --> 00:07:11,201
Excitement, adventure, danger
lurking around every corner...

69
00:07:11,242 --> 00:07:14,706
Ariel!

70
00:07:14,748 --> 00:07:18,461
Oh, are you OK?

71
00:07:18,544 --> 00:07:20,672
Yeah, sure. No problem. I'm OK.

72
00:07:20,713 --> 00:07:22,715
Shh!

73
00:07:27,553 --> 00:07:31,224
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh!

74
00:07:31,308 --> 00:07:34,895
Have you ever seen anything so
wonderful in your entire life?

75
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:38,693
Wow! Cool! But, uh, what is it?

76
00:07:38,734 --> 00:07:41,862
I don't know, but I bet Scuttle will.

77
00:07:41,946 --> 00:07:43,906
What was that?

78
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:45,741
Did you hear something?

79
00:07:45,825 --> 00:07:48,203
Mmm? I wonder what this one is.

80
00:07:48,245 --> 00:07:51,373
- Ariel?
- Flounder, will you relax?

81
00:07:51,456 --> 00:07:53,709
Nothing is going to happen.

82
00:07:53,792 --> 00:07:55,836
Shark!

83
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,674
Shark! We're gonna die!

84
00:08:15,567 --> 00:08:17,235
Oh, no!

85
00:08:46,646 --> 00:08:49,274
You big bully!

86
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:53,612
Flounder, you really are a guppy.

87
00:08:53,654 --> 00:08:55,280
I am not.

88
00:08:57,741 --> 00:09:00,869
â™ª Hmm-hmm, fourteen hundred
and ninety-two â™ª

89
00:09:00,952 --> 00:09:03,373
â™ª Dah-de-dum
Dee-do-do â™ª

90
00:09:03,456 --> 00:09:05,958
â™ª Rum-dim-dim
Dee-do-dee-do â™ª

91
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,546
- Scuttle!
- Whoa!

92
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:12,342
Mermaid off the port bow!

93
00:09:12,425 --> 00:09:16,346
Ariel, how you doin', kid?

94
00:09:16,429 --> 00:09:20,142
- Whoa, what a swim.
- Scuttle, look what we found.

95
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:23,145
We were in this sunken ship,
and it was really creepy...

96
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:26,524
Human stuff, huh? Hey, let me see.

97
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:34,785
Oh! Oh! Look at this.

98
00:09:34,868 --> 00:09:38,288
Wow. This is special.
This is very, very unusual.

99
00:09:38,372 --> 00:09:42,376
- What? What is it?
- It's a dinglehopper.

100
00:09:42,459 --> 00:09:45,754
Humans use these little babies...

101
00:09:45,838 --> 00:09:47,798
to straighten their hair out.

102
00:09:47,881 --> 00:09:52,637
See? Just a little twirl here
and a yank there and violee...

103
00:09:52,721 --> 00:09:56,643
Ya got an aesthetically pleasing
configuration of hair

104
00:09:56,727 --> 00:09:58,812
that humans go nuts over.

105
00:09:58,895 --> 00:10:00,897
A dinglehopper.

106
00:10:00,981 --> 00:10:02,691
- What about that one?
- Ah!

107
00:10:02,774 --> 00:10:08,573
This I haven't seen in years.
This is wonderful!

108
00:10:08,656 --> 00:10:13,911
- A banded, bulbous snarfblatt.
- Oh!

109
00:10:13,995 --> 00:10:19,210
The snarfblatt dates to prehistorical
times when humans used to sit around

110
00:10:19,294 --> 00:10:22,548
and stare at each other all day.

111
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,592
Got very boring.

112
00:10:24,633 --> 00:10:29,180
So, they invented this
snarfblatt to make fine music.

113
00:10:29,263 --> 00:10:31,557
Allow me.

114
00:10:31,599 --> 00:10:33,100
Music!

115
00:10:33,184 --> 00:10:35,479
- It's stuck!
- Oh, the concert!

116
00:10:35,562 --> 00:10:37,939
Oh, my gosh! My father's gonna kill me!

117
00:10:38,023 --> 00:10:39,401
The concert was today?

118
00:10:39,443 --> 00:10:41,695
You could make
a little planter out of it.

119
00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:45,115
I'm sorry! I've gotta go!
Thank you, Scuttle!

120
00:10:45,157 --> 00:10:46,742
Any time, sweetie!

121
00:10:46,784 --> 00:10:48,952
Any time.

122
00:11:02,803 --> 00:11:06,808
Yes, hurry home, Princess.

123
00:11:06,891 --> 00:11:12,313
We wouldn't want to miss old Daddy's
celebration, now, would we?

124
00:11:12,355 --> 00:11:16,984
Ha! Celebration, indeed. Oh, bah!

125
00:11:17,068 --> 00:11:22,074
In my day, we had fantastical feasts,

126
00:11:22,157 --> 00:11:26,372
when I lived in the palace.

127
00:11:27,665 --> 00:11:30,167
And now look at me.

128
00:11:30,251 --> 00:11:33,045
Wasted away to practically nothing.

129
00:11:33,129 --> 00:11:37,175
Banished and exiled
and practically starving,

130
00:11:37,259 --> 00:11:42,305
while he and his flimsy
fish folk celebrate.

131
00:11:42,347 --> 00:11:47,394
Well, I'll give 'em something
to celebrate soon enough.

132
00:11:47,477 --> 00:11:49,648
Flotsam! Jetsam!

133
00:11:49,732 --> 00:11:54,988
I want you to keep an extra close watch
on this pretty little daughter of his.

134
00:11:55,030 --> 00:12:00,118
She may be the key to Triton's undoing.

135
00:12:03,955 --> 00:12:08,002
I just don't know what we're
going to do with you, young lady.

136
00:12:08,085 --> 00:12:09,670
Daddy, I'm sorry. I just forgot.

137
00:12:09,754 --> 00:12:11,841
As a result of your careless behavior...

138
00:12:11,924 --> 00:12:13,760
Careless and reckless behavior!

139
00:12:13,843 --> 00:12:16,054
...the entire celebration was, uh...

140
00:12:16,137 --> 00:12:19,807
Well, it was ruined! That's all!
Completely destroyed!

141
00:12:19,891 --> 00:12:22,018
This concert was to be

142
00:12:22,101 --> 00:12:25,689
the pinnacle of my distinguished career.

143
00:12:25,773 --> 00:12:29,526
Now, thanks to you, I am the
laughingstock of the entire kingdom!

144
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:31,195
But it wasn't her fault...

145
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:34,950
Uh, well, first, uh,
the shark chased us.

146
00:12:35,034 --> 00:12:38,538
Yeah, yeah. And we tried to...
but we couldn't, and he...

147
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:41,792
And... And we... Whoa!

148
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:43,794
And then we were safe.

149
00:12:43,877 --> 00:12:46,630
But then this seagull came,
and it was, "This is this..."

150
00:12:46,713 --> 00:12:48,382
Seagull?

151
00:12:48,423 --> 00:12:51,176
What? Oh!

152
00:12:51,259 --> 00:12:53,345
You went up to the surface again,
didn't you?

153
00:12:53,428 --> 00:12:55,890
- Didn't you?
- Nothing happened.

154
00:12:55,932 --> 00:13:00,188
Oh, Ariel, how many times
must we go through this?

155
00:13:00,271 --> 00:13:04,901
You could have been seen by one of those
barbarians, by one of those humans!

156
00:13:04,943 --> 00:13:07,529
- They're not barbarians.
- They are dangerous.

157
00:13:07,612 --> 00:13:11,575
Do you think I want to see my youngest
daughter snared by a fish-eater's hook?

158
00:13:11,659 --> 00:13:14,161
I'm 16 years old.
I'm not a child anymore.

159
00:13:14,245 --> 00:13:16,914
Don't you take that tone of voice
with me, young lady!

160
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:20,461
As long as you live under my ocean,
you'll obey my rules!

161
00:13:20,513 --> 00:13:23,423
- If you would just listen...
- Not another word!

162
00:13:23,464 --> 00:13:27,886
And I am never... never to hear of you
going to the surface again!

163
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:29,930
Is that clear?

164
00:13:35,144 --> 00:13:37,730
Hmph! Teenagers.

165
00:13:37,813 --> 00:13:40,108
They think they know everything.

166
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:43,822
You give them an inch,
they swim all over you.

167
00:13:43,905 --> 00:13:47,909
Do you think I was too hard on her?

168
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,120
Definitely not.

169
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:55,251
Why, if Ariel was my daughter,
I'd show her who was boss.

170
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:58,921
None of this flitting to the surface
and other such nonsense.

171
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:01,841
No, sir. I'd keep her
under tight control.

172
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,677
- You're right, Sebastian.
- Of course.

173
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:07,432
Ariel needs constant supervision.

174
00:14:07,515 --> 00:14:10,268
Someone to watch over her,
to keep her out of trouble.

175
00:14:10,353 --> 00:14:11,437
All the time.

176
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,148
And you are just the crab to do it.

177
00:14:15,524 --> 00:14:18,819
How do I get myself
into these situations?

178
00:14:18,861 --> 00:14:20,863
I should be writing symphonies,

179
00:14:20,946 --> 00:14:24,617
not tagging along after
some headstrong teenager.

180
00:14:27,287 --> 00:14:31,794
Hmm? What is that girl up to?

181
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:01,369
Huh?

182
00:15:08,251 --> 00:15:11,379
Ariel, are you OK?

183
00:15:11,462 --> 00:15:14,091
If only I could
make him understand.

184
00:15:14,174 --> 00:15:17,179
I just don't see things the way he does.

185
00:15:17,263 --> 00:15:21,434
I don't see how a world
that makes such wonderful things

186
00:15:21,475 --> 00:15:23,060
could be bad.

187
00:15:24,336 --> 00:15:27,774
â™ª Look at this stuff, isn't it neat â™ª

188
00:15:27,858 --> 00:15:31,153
â™ª Wouldn't ya think
my collection's complete â™ª

189
00:15:31,236 --> 00:15:34,406
â™ª Wouldn't ya think I'm the girl â™ª

190
00:15:34,448 --> 00:15:37,909
â™ª The girl who has everything â™ª

191
00:15:37,951 --> 00:15:41,248
â™ª Look at this trove, treasures untold â™ª

192
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:44,627
â™ª How many wonders
can one cavern hold? â™ª

193
00:15:44,669 --> 00:15:47,338
â™ª Lookin' around here you'd think â™ª

194
00:15:47,422 --> 00:15:50,717
â™ª Sure, she's got everything â™ª

195
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,596
â™ª I've got gadgets and gizmos aplenty â™ª

196
00:15:54,637 --> 00:15:58,100
â™ª I've got whozits and whatzits galore â™ª

197
00:15:58,142 --> 00:16:01,939
â™ª You want thingamabobs? I got 20 â™ª

198
00:16:01,981 --> 00:16:06,235
â™ª But who cares
No big deal â™ª

199
00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:11,324
â™ª I want more â™ª

200
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,789
â™ª I wanna be where the people are â™ª

201
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:20,918
â™ª I wanna see
Wanna see 'em dancin' â™ª

202
00:16:21,001 --> 00:16:23,128
â™ª Walkin' around on those... â™ª

203
00:16:23,212 --> 00:16:24,715
What do ya call 'em?

204
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:25,800
Oh, feet.

205
00:16:27,843 --> 00:16:31,431
â™ª Flippin' your fins
you don't get too far â™ª

206
00:16:31,515 --> 00:16:34,976
â™ª Legs are required
for jumpin', dancin' â™ª

207
00:16:35,018 --> 00:16:37,145
â™ª Strollin' along down a... â™ª

208
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:39,147
What's that word again?

209
00:16:39,189 --> 00:16:40,732
â™ª Street â™ª

210
00:16:40,816 --> 00:16:45,488
â™ª Up where they walk
Up where they run â™ª

211
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:48,618
â™ª Up where they stay all day in the sun â™ª

212
00:16:48,701 --> 00:16:52,497
â™ª Wanderin' free
Wish I could be â™ª

213
00:16:52,539 --> 00:16:55,625
â™ª Part of that world â™ª

214
00:16:55,709 --> 00:16:59,422
â™ª What would I give if I could live â™ª

215
00:16:59,505 --> 00:17:01,841
â™ª Out of these waters? â™ª

216
00:17:01,882 --> 00:17:05,261
â™ª What would I pay to spend a day â™ª

217
00:17:05,344 --> 00:17:08,597
â™ª Warm on the sand? â™ª

218
00:17:08,681 --> 00:17:11,602
â™ª Betcha on land they understand â™ª

219
00:17:11,686 --> 00:17:16,233
â™ª Bet they don't reprimand
their daughters â™ª

220
00:17:16,316 --> 00:17:19,611
â™ª Bright young women sick of swimmin' â™ª

221
00:17:19,695 --> 00:17:25,075
â™ª Ready to stand â™ª

222
00:17:25,159 --> 00:17:28,996
â™ª And ready to know
what the people know â™ª

223
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:32,667
â™ª Ask 'em my questions
and get some answers â™ª

224
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:35,229
â™ª What's a fire and why does it... â™ª

225
00:17:35,313 --> 00:17:37,049
â™ª What's the word? â™ª

226
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:39,134
â™ª Burn? â™ª

227
00:17:39,217 --> 00:17:43,013
â™ª When's it my turn? Wouldn't I love â™ª

228
00:17:43,096 --> 00:17:48,936
â™ª Love to explore that shore up above? â™ª

229
00:17:50,271 --> 00:17:53,775
â™ª Out of the sea â™ª

230
00:17:54,859 --> 00:17:57,447
â™ª Wish I could be â™ª

231
00:17:59,199 --> 00:18:02,495
â™ª Part of that â™ª

232
00:18:02,578 --> 00:18:06,999
â™ª World â™ª

233
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:28,324
Sebastian!

234
00:18:32,929 --> 00:18:37,158
Ariel, what are you...
How could you... What is all this?

235
00:18:37,242 --> 00:18:40,745
It's, uh... It's just my collection.

236
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:43,875
Oh, I see.

237
00:18:43,959 --> 00:18:48,756
Your collection, hmm.
If your father knew about this place...

238
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,800
You're not gonna tell him, are you?

239
00:18:50,842 --> 00:18:53,344
Oh, please, Sebastian,
he would never understand.

240
00:18:53,428 --> 00:18:57,373
Ariel, you're under
a lot of pressure down here.

241
00:18:57,457 --> 00:18:59,267
Come with me, I'll take you home

242
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:01,769
and get you something warm to drink.

243
00:19:01,853 --> 00:19:04,732
- What do you suppose...
- Ariel?

244
00:19:06,152 --> 00:19:08,696
Ariel?

245
00:19:18,707 --> 00:19:22,002
Ariel, what are you...

246
00:19:22,043 --> 00:19:24,671
Jumpin' jellyfish!

247
00:19:26,757 --> 00:19:31,513
Ariel? Ariel! Please! Come back!

248
00:20:09,098 --> 00:20:12,226
Max! Here, boy!

249
00:20:17,942 --> 00:20:21,613
Hey, come on, mutt.
What ya doin', huh, Max?

250
00:20:21,696 --> 00:20:24,616
Come on, Max.

251
00:20:24,699 --> 00:20:28,036
Good boy. Good boy.

252
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:36,129
Hey there, sweetie! Quite a show, eh?

253
00:20:36,212 --> 00:20:38,633
Scuttle, be quiet. They'll hear you.

254
00:20:38,716 --> 00:20:41,052
Ooh, I got ya. I got ya.

255
00:20:41,136 --> 00:20:44,889
We're bein' intrepidaceous.
We're out to discover!

256
00:20:44,973 --> 00:20:48,935
I've never seen a human
this close before.

257
00:20:49,018 --> 00:20:54,150
Oh. He's very handsome, isn't he?

258
00:20:54,233 --> 00:20:57,653
I don't know. He looks kind of
hairy and slobbery to me.

259
00:20:57,695 --> 00:21:00,531
Not that one.

260
00:21:00,614 --> 00:21:03,745
The one playing the snarfblatt.

261
00:21:03,828 --> 00:21:06,498
Silence, silence.

262
00:21:06,582 --> 00:21:09,501
It is now my honor and privilege

263
00:21:09,585 --> 00:21:11,879
to present our esteemed Prince Eric

264
00:21:11,962 --> 00:21:14,673
with a very special, very expensive,

265
00:21:14,757 --> 00:21:17,593
very large birthday present.

266
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:21,222
Ah, Grimsby, ya old beanpole,
you shouldn't have.

267
00:21:21,264 --> 00:21:23,183
I know.

268
00:21:23,224 --> 00:21:26,062
Happy birthday, Eric.

269
00:21:31,067 --> 00:21:33,820
Uh, gee, Grim... Ha!

270
00:21:33,904 --> 00:21:37,366
It's, uh... It's really somethin'.

271
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:39,452
Yes, I commissioned it myself.

272
00:21:39,535 --> 00:21:43,498
Of course, I had hoped
it would be a wedding present.

273
00:21:43,581 --> 00:21:46,000
Come on, Grim. Don't start.

274
00:21:46,042 --> 00:21:50,298
You're not still sore because I didn't
fall for the princess of Glowerhaven?

275
00:21:50,381 --> 00:21:53,677
Oh, my! Oh, Eric, it isn't me alone.

276
00:21:53,719 --> 00:21:59,391
The entire kingdom wants to see you
happily settled with the right girl.

277
00:21:59,475 --> 00:22:02,353
Oh, she's out there somewhere. I just...

278
00:22:02,394 --> 00:22:05,397
I just haven't found her yet.

279
00:22:05,481 --> 00:22:08,735
Perhaps you haven't
been looking hard enough.

280
00:22:08,819 --> 00:22:11,490
Believe me, Grim,
when I find her, I'll know.

281
00:22:11,573 --> 00:22:16,245
Without a doubt, it'll just...
bam... hit me, like lightning.

282
00:22:21,793 --> 00:22:23,753
Hurricane a-comin'!

283
00:22:23,837 --> 00:22:29,050
Stand fast! Secure the riggin'!

284
00:22:45,027 --> 00:22:50,450
Whoa! The wind's all of a sudden
on the move here! Yo!

285
00:22:50,533 --> 00:22:53,787
Ariel!

286
00:23:28,536 --> 00:23:30,789
Look out!

287
00:23:42,845 --> 00:23:46,349
Grim! Hang on!

288
00:23:49,227 --> 00:23:51,813
Max!

289
00:24:05,246 --> 00:24:07,498
Jump, Max!

290
00:24:07,581 --> 00:24:11,336
Come on, boy! Jump! You can do it, Max!

291
00:24:19,719 --> 00:24:22,013
Eric!

292
00:25:02,102 --> 00:25:05,856
Is he... dead?

293
00:25:05,939 --> 00:25:07,900
It's hard to say.

294
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:15,869
Oh, I... I can't make out a heartbeat.

295
00:25:15,952 --> 00:25:19,080
No, look! He's breathing.

296
00:25:20,624 --> 00:25:22,584
He's so beautiful.

297
00:25:24,961 --> 00:25:29,717
â™ª What would I give
to live where you are? â™ª

298
00:25:29,801 --> 00:25:33,763
â™ª What would I pay
to stay here beside you? â™ª

299
00:25:33,805 --> 00:25:40,688
â™ª What would I do
to see you smiling at me? â™ª

300
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:44,610
â™ª Where would we walk
Where would we run â™ª

301
00:25:44,652 --> 00:25:48,322
â™ª If we could stay all day in the sun? â™ª

302
00:25:48,405 --> 00:25:52,660
â™ª Just you and me and I could be â™ª

303
00:25:52,743 --> 00:25:56,790
â™ª Part of your world â™ª

304
00:25:59,042 --> 00:26:02,798
Eric? Eric!

305
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:07,177
You really delight in
these sadistic strains

306
00:26:07,261 --> 00:26:09,513
on my blood pressure, don't you?

307
00:26:09,596 --> 00:26:12,809
A girl... rescued me.

308
00:26:12,892 --> 00:26:16,855
She... She was singing.

309
00:26:16,938 --> 00:26:20,733
She had the most beautiful voice.

310
00:26:20,817 --> 00:26:24,990
Ah, Eric, I think you've swallowed
a bit too much seawater.

311
00:26:25,031 --> 00:26:28,703
Off we go. Come along, Max.

312
00:26:28,786 --> 00:26:31,706
We just gonna forget
this whole thing ever happened.

313
00:26:31,789 --> 00:26:33,875
The sea king will never know.

314
00:26:33,958 --> 00:26:38,713
You won't tell him. I won't tell him.
I will stay in one piece.

315
00:26:38,796 --> 00:26:43,844
â™ª I don't know when
I don't know how â™ª

316
00:26:43,886 --> 00:26:50,186
â™ª But I know something's
starting right now â™ª

317
00:26:50,227 --> 00:26:53,522
â™ª Watch and you'll see â™ª

318
00:26:53,564 --> 00:26:56,859
â™ª Some day I'll be â™ª

319
00:26:56,901 --> 00:26:59,362
â™ª Part of your â™ª

320
00:26:59,404 --> 00:27:04,242
â™ª World â™ª

321
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:19,886
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I can't stand it. It's too easy.

322
00:27:19,969 --> 00:27:23,389
The child is in love with a human.

323
00:27:23,441 --> 00:27:26,810
And not just any human. A prince!

324
00:27:26,893 --> 00:27:31,190
Her daddy will love that.

325
00:27:31,273 --> 00:27:34,445
King Triton's headstrong, lovesick girl

326
00:27:34,529 --> 00:27:39,867
would make a charming addition
to my little garden.

327
00:27:50,963 --> 00:27:54,091
Ariel dear, time to come out.

328
00:27:54,174 --> 00:27:56,178
You've been in there all morning.

329
00:27:59,558 --> 00:28:02,477
What is with her lately?

330
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:09,818
- Oh. Morning, Daddy.
- Well!

331
00:28:14,532 --> 00:28:18,246
- Oh, she's got it bad.
- What? What has she got?

332
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:22,167
Isn't it obvious, Daddy?
Ariel's in love.

333
00:28:22,208 --> 00:28:26,421
Ariel? In love?

334
00:28:26,504 --> 00:28:29,132
OK. So far, so good.

335
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:32,344
I don't think the king knows.

336
00:28:32,428 --> 00:28:37,057
But it will not be easy keeping
something like this a secret for long.

337
00:28:37,141 --> 00:28:40,686
He loves me.

338
00:28:40,769 --> 00:28:43,816
Mmm. He loves me not.

339
00:28:43,858 --> 00:28:48,363
He loves me! I knew it!

340
00:28:48,447 --> 00:28:50,365
Ariel, stop talking crazy!

341
00:28:50,449 --> 00:28:52,910
I gotta see him again... tonight.

342
00:28:52,993 --> 00:28:55,913
- Scuttle knows where he lives.
- Ariel, please!

343
00:28:55,996 --> 00:28:59,708
Will you get your head out of the clouds
and back in the water where it belongs?

344
00:28:59,791 --> 00:29:03,630
I'll swim to his castle, then Flounder
will splash around to get his attention.

345
00:29:03,713 --> 00:29:06,384
- And then we'll go...
- Down here is your home!

346
00:29:06,551 --> 00:29:08,845
Ariel, listen to me.

347
00:29:08,887 --> 00:29:10,847
The human world... It's a mess.

348
00:29:10,889 --> 00:29:15,727
Life under the sea is better
than anything they got up there.

349
00:29:15,812 --> 00:29:20,733
â™ª The seaweed is always greener
in somebody else's lake â™ª

350
00:29:20,817 --> 00:29:23,069
â™ª You dream about going up there

351
00:29:23,152 --> 00:29:25,738
â™ª But that is a big mistake â™ª

352
00:29:25,822 --> 00:29:27,992
â™ª Just look at the world around you â™ª

353
00:29:28,076 --> 00:29:30,453
â™ª Right here on the ocean floor â™ª

354
00:29:30,537 --> 00:29:32,915
â™ª Such wonderful things around you â™ª

355
00:29:32,957 --> 00:29:35,501
â™ª What more is you lookin' for? â™ª

356
00:29:35,584 --> 00:29:40,256
â™ª Under the sea
Under the sea â™ª

357
00:29:40,339 --> 00:29:43,425
â™ª Darling, it's better
down where it's wetter â™ª

358
00:29:43,509 --> 00:29:45,427
â™ª Take it from me â™ª

359
00:29:45,511 --> 00:29:47,430
â™ª Up on the shore they work all day â™ª

360
00:29:47,472 --> 00:29:49,432
â™ª Out in the sun they slave away â™ª

361
00:29:49,474 --> 00:29:52,938
â™ª While we devoting full time
to floating under the sea â™ª

362
00:29:58,026 --> 00:30:00,112
â™ª Down here all the fish is happy â™ª

363
00:30:00,195 --> 00:30:02,782
â™ª As off through the waves
they roll, yeah â™ª

364
00:30:02,866 --> 00:30:04,784
â™ª The fish on the land ain't happy â™ª

365
00:30:04,868 --> 00:30:07,620
â™ª They sad 'cause they in the bowl â™ª

366
00:30:07,704 --> 00:30:10,248
â™ª But fish in the bowl is lucky â™ª

367
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:12,417
â™ª They in for a worser fate â™ª

368
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,963
â™ª One day when the boss get hungry â™ª

369
00:30:15,046 --> 00:30:16,965
â™ª Guess who's gonna be on the plate â™ª

370
00:30:17,048 --> 00:30:18,092
Oh, no!

371
00:30:18,176 --> 00:30:21,929
â™ª Under the sea
Under the sea â™ª

372
00:30:22,013 --> 00:30:26,142
â™ª Nobody beat us, fry us
and eat us in fricassee â™ª

373
00:30:26,225 --> 00:30:29,645
â™ª We what the land folks loves to cook â™ª

374
00:30:29,729 --> 00:30:32,148
â™ª Under the sea we off the hook â™ª

375
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:34,693
â™ª We got no troubles
Life is the bubbles â™ª

376
00:30:34,776 --> 00:30:36,780
- â™ª Under the sea â™ª
- â™ª Under the sea â™ª

377
00:30:36,864 --> 00:30:38,824
- â™ª Under the sea â™ª
- â™ª Under the sea â™ª

378
00:30:38,908 --> 00:30:41,577
â™ª Since life is sweet here
we got it beat here â™ª

379
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:44,497
- â™ª Naturally â™ª
- â™ª Naturally â™ª

380
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:46,290
â™ª Even the sturgeon and the ray â™ª

381
00:30:46,373 --> 00:30:48,919
â™ª They get the urge and start to play â™ª

382
00:30:49,002 --> 00:30:54,007
â™ª We got the spirit,
you got to hear it, under the sea â™ª

383
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:56,343
â™ª The newt play the flute
The carp play the harp â™ª

384
00:30:56,426 --> 00:30:58,803
â™ª The plaice play the bass
and they soundin' sharp â™ª

385
00:30:58,845 --> 00:31:01,308
â™ª The bass play the brass
The chub play the tub â™ª

386
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:03,686
â™ª The fluke is the duke of soul â™ª

387
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:06,022
â™ª The ray, he can play
The ling's on the strings â™ª

388
00:31:06,105 --> 00:31:08,358
â™ª The trout's rocking out
The blackfish, she sings â™ª

389
00:31:08,441 --> 00:31:10,985
â™ª The smelt and the sprat
They know where it's at â™ª

390
00:31:11,027 --> 00:31:13,696
â™ª And, oh that blowfish blow â™ª

391
00:31:37,641 --> 00:31:41,687
- â™ª Yeah, under the sea â™ª
- â™ª Under the sea â™ª

392
00:31:41,728 --> 00:31:44,189
- â™ª Under the sea â™ª
- â™ª Under the sea â™ª

393
00:31:44,231 --> 00:31:46,277
â™ª When the sardine begin the beguine â™ª

394
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,237
- â™ª It's music to me â™ª
- â™ª Music it is to me â™ª

395
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,283
â™ª What do they got? A lot of sand â™ª

396
00:31:51,366 --> 00:31:53,535
â™ª We got a hot crustacean band â™ª

397
00:31:53,618 --> 00:31:56,913
â™ª Each little clam here
know how to jam here under the sea â™ª

398
00:31:58,331 --> 00:32:03,044
â™ª Each little slug here
cutting a rug here under the sea â™ª

399
00:32:03,086 --> 00:32:05,548
â™ª Each little snail here
know how to wail here â™ª

400
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,301
â™ª That's why it's hotter
under the water â™ª

401
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:11,514
â™ª Yeah, we in luck here
down in the muck here â™ª

402
00:32:11,598 --> 00:32:15,852
â™ª Under the sea â™ª

403
00:32:18,538 --> 00:32:20,265
Ariel?

404
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:28,574
Oh, somebody's got to
nail that girl's fins to the floor.

405
00:32:29,783 --> 00:32:32,079
Sebastian!

406
00:32:32,121 --> 00:32:35,959
Sebastian, I've been
looking all over for you.

407
00:32:36,043 --> 00:32:38,253
I've got an urgent message
from the sea king.

408
00:32:38,337 --> 00:32:40,505
The sea king?

409
00:32:40,589 --> 00:32:44,092
He wants to see you right away.
Something about Ariel.

410
00:32:44,234 --> 00:32:46,803
Oh, he knows!

411
00:32:46,887 --> 00:32:49,806
Hey, let's see now.

412
00:32:49,848 --> 00:32:54,062
Oh, who could the lucky merman be?

413
00:32:56,316 --> 00:33:01,112
Come in, Sebastian.

414
00:33:01,996 --> 00:33:04,166
I mustn't overreact.

415
00:33:04,249 --> 00:33:07,828
I must remain calm.

416
00:33:13,016 --> 00:33:15,545
Yes?

417
00:33:15,628 --> 00:33:18,633
- Yes, Your Majesty?
- Sebastian.

418
00:33:18,675 --> 00:33:21,887
I'm concerned about Ariel.

419
00:33:21,971 --> 00:33:25,307
Have you noticed she's been
acting peculiar lately?

420
00:33:25,349 --> 00:33:30,354
- Oh! Uh, peculiar?
- You know, mooning about.

421
00:33:30,437 --> 00:33:34,149
Daydreaming, singing to herself.

422
00:33:34,233 --> 00:33:36,318
You haven't noticed, hmm?

423
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:39,197
Oh, well, I...

424
00:33:39,281 --> 00:33:42,703
- Sebastian?
- Hmm?

425
00:33:43,704 --> 00:33:47,666
I know you've been
keeping something from me.

426
00:33:47,708 --> 00:33:50,961
Keeping something?

427
00:33:51,044 --> 00:33:52,964
About Ariel?

428
00:33:56,092 --> 00:33:59,554
- Ariel?
- In love, hmm?

429
00:33:59,596 --> 00:34:05,145
I tried to stop her, sir!
She wouldn't listen!

430
00:34:05,228 --> 00:34:08,357
I told her to stay away from humans!
They are bad!

431
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:13,154
- They are trouble!
- Humans? What about humans?

432
00:34:13,237 --> 00:34:16,782
Humans?

433
00:34:16,908 --> 00:34:21,537
Who said anything about humans?

434
00:34:21,579 --> 00:34:23,811
Flounder, why can't you just
tell me what this is all about?

435
00:34:23,863 --> 00:34:26,043
Flounder, why can't you just
tell me what this is all about?

436
00:34:26,126 --> 00:34:29,757
You'll see. It's a surprise.

437
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,884
Oh, Flounder.

438
00:34:33,969 --> 00:34:35,971
Flounder, you're the best!

439
00:34:36,055 --> 00:34:40,602
It looks just like him.
It even has his eyes.

440
00:34:40,685 --> 00:34:45,732
Why, Eric, run away with you?

441
00:34:45,815 --> 00:34:49,528
Oh, this is all so... so sudden.

442
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:54,869
Daddy?

443
00:34:58,289 --> 00:35:02,252
I consider myself a reasonable merman.

444
00:35:02,335 --> 00:35:07,298
I set certain rules,
and I expect those rules to be obeyed.

445
00:35:07,382 --> 00:35:08,884
But, Dad, I...

446
00:35:08,968 --> 00:35:12,221
Is it true you rescued
a human from drowning?

447
00:35:12,304 --> 00:35:13,266
I had to...

448
00:35:13,349 --> 00:35:16,936
Contact between the human world
and the mer world is strictly forbidden.

449
00:35:17,061 --> 00:35:19,814
Ariel, you know that!
Everyone knows that.

450
00:35:19,855 --> 00:35:23,401
- He would have died.
- One less human to worry about.

451
00:35:23,484 --> 00:35:25,737
- You don't even know him.
- Know him?

452
00:35:25,821 --> 00:35:28,907
I don't have to know him!
They're all the same.

453
00:35:28,991 --> 00:35:31,410
Spineless, savage,
harpooning fish-eaters

454
00:35:31,493 --> 00:35:32,911
incapable of any feeling...

455
00:35:32,995 --> 00:35:35,916
Daddy, I love him!

456
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,255
No! Have you lost
your senses completely?

457
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:42,257
He's a human. You're a mermaid.

458
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,800
I don't care.

459
00:35:43,884 --> 00:35:48,013
So help me, Ariel,
I am going to get through to you.

460
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:51,975
And if this is the only way, so be it!

461
00:35:54,686 --> 00:35:57,523
Daddy! No!

462
00:35:57,607 --> 00:36:00,194
No! Please!

463
00:36:00,278 --> 00:36:03,990
Daddy, stop! Daddy, stop it!

464
00:36:06,701 --> 00:36:08,912
Daddy, no!

465
00:36:32,439 --> 00:36:34,399
Ariel, I...

466
00:36:34,441 --> 00:36:36,777
Just go away.

467
00:36:55,131 --> 00:37:00,721
Poor child. Poor, sweet child.

468
00:37:00,805 --> 00:37:05,726
She has a very serious problem.

469
00:37:05,768 --> 00:37:09,107
If only there were
something we could do.

470
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:12,111
But there is something.

471
00:37:12,194 --> 00:37:16,865
Who... Who are you?

472
00:37:16,949 --> 00:37:19,159
Don't be scared.

473
00:37:19,243 --> 00:37:22,454
We represent someone who can help you.

474
00:37:22,538 --> 00:37:27,627
Someone who can make
all your dreams come true.

475
00:37:27,711 --> 00:37:29,754
Just imagine...

476
00:37:29,796 --> 00:37:31,800
You and your prince...

477
00:37:31,884 --> 00:37:35,429
Together forever.

478
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:37,431
I don't understand.

479
00:37:37,472 --> 00:37:43,313
Ursula has great powers.

480
00:37:43,396 --> 00:37:47,358
The sea witch?

481
00:37:47,442 --> 00:37:50,695
Why, that's... I couldn't possibly.

482
00:37:50,778 --> 00:37:53,825
No! Get out of here. Leave me alone!

483
00:37:53,909 --> 00:37:56,119
Suit yourself.

484
00:37:57,162 --> 00:38:00,458
It was only a suggestion.

485
00:38:10,051 --> 00:38:11,093
Wait.

486
00:38:11,177 --> 00:38:14,598
Yes?

487
00:38:14,681 --> 00:38:18,979
- Poor Ariel.
- I didn't mean to tell.

488
00:38:19,104 --> 00:38:21,878
It was an accident.

489
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:24,652
Ariel? Where are you going?

490
00:38:24,693 --> 00:38:27,321
Ariel, what are you doing here
with this riffraff?

491
00:38:27,404 --> 00:38:29,324
I'm going to see Ursula.

492
00:38:29,366 --> 00:38:33,828
Ariel, no! No!
She's a demon. She's a monster.

493
00:38:33,912 --> 00:38:37,207
Why don't you go tell my father?
You're good at that.

494
00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:42,089
But... But, I... Come on!

495
00:38:57,564 --> 00:38:59,233
This way.

496
00:39:17,129 --> 00:39:21,383
Come in. Come in, my child.

497
00:39:21,466 --> 00:39:26,724
We mustn't lurk in doorways. It's rude.

498
00:39:26,765 --> 00:39:30,729
One might question
your upbringing.

499
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,317
Now, then, you're here

500
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:40,363
because you have a thing for
this human, this prince fellow.

501
00:39:40,447 --> 00:39:46,037
Not that I blame you.
He is quite a catch, isn't he?

502
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,623
Well, angelfish,

503
00:39:48,706 --> 00:39:53,588
the solution to your problem is simple.

504
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:55,673
The only way to get what you want

505
00:39:55,757 --> 00:39:57,759
is to become a human yourself.

506
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,930
Can you do that?

507
00:40:02,514 --> 00:40:07,478
My dear, sweet child. That's what I do.

508
00:40:07,519 --> 00:40:09,563
It's what I live for.

509
00:40:09,647 --> 00:40:13,903
To help unfortunate merfolk,
like yourself,

510
00:40:13,986 --> 00:40:20,118
poor souls with no one else to turn to.

511
00:40:20,202 --> 00:40:23,705
â™ª I admit that in the past
I've been a nasty â™ª

512
00:40:23,789 --> 00:40:27,459
â™ª They weren't kidding when
they called me, well, a witch â™ª

513
00:40:27,501 --> 00:40:30,837
â™ª But you'll find that nowadays
I've mended all my ways â™ª

514
00:40:30,921 --> 00:40:33,341
â™ª Repented, seen the light
and made a switch â™ª

515
00:40:33,424 --> 00:40:35,762
True? Yes.

516
00:40:35,845 --> 00:40:39,641
â™ª And I fortunately know a little magic â™ª

517
00:40:39,683 --> 00:40:42,811
â™ª It's a talent that
I always have possessed â™ª

518
00:40:42,894 --> 00:40:46,399
â™ª And here lately, please don't
laugh, I use it on behalf â™ª

519
00:40:46,482 --> 00:40:49,360
â™ª Of the miserable,
lonely and depressed â™ª

520
00:40:49,643 --> 00:40:51,454
Pathetic.

521
00:40:51,737 --> 00:40:54,824
â™ª Poor unfortunate souls â™ª

522
00:40:54,907 --> 00:40:58,079
â™ª In pain, in need â™ª

523
00:40:58,162 --> 00:40:59,706
â™ª This one longing to be thinner â™ª

524
00:40:59,789 --> 00:41:01,291
â™ª That one wants to get the girl â™ª

525
00:41:01,374 --> 00:41:04,461
â™ª And do I help them? Yes, indeed â™ª

526
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:10,384
â™ª Those poor, unfortunate souls
So sad, so true â™ª

527
00:41:10,467 --> 00:41:12,052
â™ª They come flocking to my cauldron â™ª

528
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:13,679
â™ª Crying spells, Ursula, please â™ª

529
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:17,225
â™ª And I help them
Yes, I do â™ª

530
00:41:17,309 --> 00:41:19,227
â™ª Now it's happened once or twice â™ª

531
00:41:19,269 --> 00:41:21,398
â™ª Someone couldn't pay the price â™ª

532
00:41:21,481 --> 00:41:26,570
â™ª And I'm afraid I had to
rake 'em across the coals â™ª

533
00:41:26,653 --> 00:41:28,572
â™ª Yes, I've had the odd complaint â™ª

534
00:41:28,655 --> 00:41:31,491
â™ª But on the whole I've been a saint â™ª

535
00:41:31,575 --> 00:41:36,581
â™ª To those poor unfortunate souls â™ª

536
00:41:36,664 --> 00:41:38,708
Now, here's the deal.

537
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:43,965
I will make you a potion that will
turn you into a human for three days.

538
00:41:44,049 --> 00:41:46,593
Got that? Three days.

539
00:41:46,676 --> 00:41:49,430
Now, listen, this is important.

540
00:41:49,513 --> 00:41:51,891
Before the sun sets on the third day,

541
00:41:51,933 --> 00:41:56,395
you've got to get dear old princie
to fall in love with you.

542
00:41:56,437 --> 00:41:59,357
That is, he's got to kiss you.

543
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:04,905
Not just any kiss,
the kiss of true love.

544
00:42:04,947 --> 00:42:08,702
If he does kiss you before
the sun sets on the third day,

545
00:42:08,786 --> 00:42:12,748
you'll remain human permanently.

546
00:42:12,831 --> 00:42:16,335
But if he doesn't, you'll turn
back into a mermaid...

547
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:20,507
and... you belong to me!

548
00:42:20,548 --> 00:42:23,385
No, Ariel!

549
00:42:23,468 --> 00:42:25,804
Have we got a deal?

550
00:42:25,887 --> 00:42:28,139
If I become human,

551
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:30,978
I'll never be with
my father or sisters again.

552
00:42:31,061 --> 00:42:33,355
That's right!

553
00:42:33,438 --> 00:42:36,693
But you'll have your man.

554
00:42:36,776 --> 00:42:42,156
Life's full of
tough choices, isn't it?

555
00:42:44,075 --> 00:42:48,329
Oh! And there is one more thing.

556
00:42:48,413 --> 00:42:50,958
We haven't discussed
the subject of payment.

557
00:42:51,041 --> 00:42:53,087
You can't get something for nothing.

558
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:55,589
- But I don't have any...
- I'm not asking much.

559
00:42:55,673 --> 00:42:59,844
Just a token really, a trifle.
You'll never even miss it.

560
00:42:59,927 --> 00:43:04,348
What I want from you is... your voice.

561
00:43:04,432 --> 00:43:08,562
- My voice?
- You've got it, sweetcakes.

562
00:43:08,645 --> 00:43:12,274
No more talking, singing. Zip!

563
00:43:12,357 --> 00:43:14,318
But without my voice, how can I...

564
00:43:14,401 --> 00:43:18,282
You'll have your looks,
your pretty face.

565
00:43:18,365 --> 00:43:23,413
And don't underestimate the
importance of body language!

566
00:43:23,455 --> 00:43:24,456
Ha!

567
00:43:24,539 --> 00:43:27,417
â™ª The men up there
don't like a lot of blabber â™ª

568
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:30,045
â™ª They think a girl
who gossips is a bore â™ª

569
00:43:30,128 --> 00:43:32,839
â™ª Yes, on land it's much preferred
for ladies not to say a word â™ª

570
00:43:32,881 --> 00:43:35,217
â™ª And, after all, dear
What is idle prattle for? â™ª

571
00:43:35,301 --> 00:43:36,719
Come on!

572
00:43:36,802 --> 00:43:39,682
â™ª They're not all that
impressed with conversation â™ª

573
00:43:39,724 --> 00:43:42,352
â™ª True gentlemen avoid it when they can â™ª

574
00:43:42,435 --> 00:43:43,978
â™ª But they dote and swoon and fawn â™ª

575
00:43:44,062 --> 00:43:45,647
â™ª On a lady who's withdrawn â™ª

576
00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:48,066
â™ª It's she who holds her tongue
who gets her man â™ª

577
00:43:48,149 --> 00:43:51,987
â™ª Come on, you poor unfortunate soul â™ª

578
00:43:52,071 --> 00:43:55,032
â™ª Go ahead, make your choice â™ª

579
00:43:55,074 --> 00:43:58,619
â™ª I'm a very busy woman
and I haven't got all day â™ª

580
00:43:58,702 --> 00:44:01,038
â™ª It won't cost much, just your voice â™ª

581
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:03,376
â™ª Ya poor, unfortunate soul â™ª

582
00:44:03,459 --> 00:44:06,380
â™ª It's sad, but true â™ª

583
00:44:06,421 --> 00:44:08,924
â™ª If you want to cross a bridge,
my sweet you've got to pay the toll â™ª

584
00:44:09,007 --> 00:44:12,260
â™ª Take a gulp and take a breath
and go ahead and sign the scroll â™ª

585
00:44:12,344 --> 00:44:14,554
â™ª Flotsam, Jetsam
Now I've got her, boys â™ª

586
00:44:14,638 --> 00:44:18,392
â™ª The boss is on a roll â™ª

587
00:44:18,517 --> 00:44:21,562
â™ª This poor, unfortunate â™ª

588
00:44:21,604 --> 00:44:27,070
â™ª Soul â™ª

589
00:44:28,613 --> 00:44:31,032
â™ª Beluga, sevruga â™ª

590
00:44:31,116 --> 00:44:34,703
â™ª Come, winds of the Caspian Sea â™ª

591
00:44:34,786 --> 00:44:38,416
â™ª Larynxis, glossitis
Et max laryngitis â™ª

592
00:44:38,457 --> 00:44:41,961
â™ª La voce to me â™ª

593
00:44:42,044 --> 00:44:44,380
Now, sing!

594
00:44:49,971 --> 00:44:51,932
Keep singing!

595
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:57,591
That voice.
I can't get it out of my head.

596
00:45:57,675 --> 00:46:01,637
I've looked everywhere, Max.
Where could she be?

597
00:46:20,534 --> 00:46:25,498
Well, look at what
the catfish dragged in.

598
00:46:25,581 --> 00:46:28,209
Look at ya. Look at ya.

599
00:46:28,251 --> 00:46:31,546
There's somethin' different.
Don't tell me.

600
00:46:31,629 --> 00:46:34,382
I got it. It's your hairdo, right?

601
00:46:34,424 --> 00:46:36,509
You've been usin' the dinglehopper?

602
00:46:38,094 --> 00:46:40,556
No? No, huh? Well, let me see.

603
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:43,602
New seashells?

604
00:46:43,644 --> 00:46:46,105
No new seashells.

605
00:46:46,188 --> 00:46:48,733
I gotta admit I can't
put my foot on it right now.

606
00:46:48,816 --> 00:46:50,401
If I stand here long enough...

607
00:46:50,443 --> 00:46:51,902
She's got legs, you idiot!

608
00:46:51,944 --> 00:46:56,366
She traded her voice to the sea
witch and got legs. Geez, man!

609
00:46:56,450 --> 00:46:57,909
I knew that.

610
00:46:57,993 --> 00:46:59,953
Ariel's been turned into a human.

611
00:46:59,995 --> 00:47:04,291
She's gotta make the prince fall in love
with her, and he's gotta kiss her.

612
00:47:04,374 --> 00:47:08,088
And she's only got three days!

613
00:47:08,172 --> 00:47:11,134
Just look at her!

614
00:47:11,176 --> 00:47:14,137
On legs! On human legs!

615
00:47:14,179 --> 00:47:18,642
My nerves are shot!
This is a catastrophe!

616
00:47:18,725 --> 00:47:21,686
What would her father say?
I'll tell you what her father'd say.

617
00:47:21,728 --> 00:47:24,981
He'd say he's gonna kill himself a crab!
That's what he'd say!

618
00:47:25,065 --> 00:47:27,985
I'm gonna march meself
straight home right now

619
00:47:28,027 --> 00:47:30,615
and tell him just like I should
have done the minute...

620
00:47:30,698 --> 00:47:34,160
And don't you shake your head
at me, young lady.

621
00:47:34,243 --> 00:47:36,287
Maybe there's still time.

622
00:47:36,329 --> 00:47:39,082
If we could get that witch
to give you back your voice,

623
00:47:39,165 --> 00:47:42,628
you could go home with all
the normal fish and just be...

624
00:47:42,711 --> 00:47:46,256
Just be...

625
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:51,553
Just be miserable
for the rest of your life.

626
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:56,645
All right, all right.

627
00:47:56,728 --> 00:48:00,774
I'll try to help ya find that prince.

628
00:48:02,901 --> 00:48:07,864
Boy, what a soft shell
I'm turning out to be.

629
00:48:07,948 --> 00:48:09,992
Now, Ariel, I'm telling ya.

630
00:48:10,033 --> 00:48:14,038
If you wanna be a human, the first thing
to do is dress like one. Let me see.

631
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:24,092
Max? What?

632
00:48:24,175 --> 00:48:26,971
Huh? What? Max!

633
00:48:28,222 --> 00:48:31,517
Ya look great, kid.

634
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:35,563
Ya look sensational.

635
00:48:46,118 --> 00:48:48,996
Max!

636
00:48:49,079 --> 00:48:50,581
Max!

637
00:48:50,664 --> 00:48:53,167
Quiet, Max.

638
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:55,836
What's gotten into you, fella? Oh.

639
00:48:55,919 --> 00:48:59,549
Oh, I see.

640
00:48:59,591 --> 00:49:02,721
Are you OK, miss?

641
00:49:02,763 --> 00:49:05,098
I'm sorry if this knucklehead
scared you.

642
00:49:05,182 --> 00:49:07,392
He's harmless really, uh...

643
00:49:09,394 --> 00:49:14,192
You seem very familiar to me.
Have we met?

644
00:49:16,861 --> 00:49:18,696
We have met. I knew it.

645
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:21,074
You're the one,
the one I've been looking for.

646
00:49:21,115 --> 00:49:23,451
What's your name?

647
00:49:23,534 --> 00:49:27,040
What's wrong? What is it?

648
00:49:28,793 --> 00:49:33,422
You can't speak? Oh!

649
00:49:33,464 --> 00:49:36,092
Oh, then you couldn't be
who I thought.

650
00:49:40,012 --> 00:49:43,975
What is it? You're hurt?

651
00:49:44,059 --> 00:49:46,728
No, no. You need help?

652
00:49:46,812 --> 00:49:49,441
Whoa, whoa, careful! Careful, easy.

653
00:49:50,693 --> 00:49:53,654
Gee, you must have
really been through something.

654
00:49:53,737 --> 00:49:55,864
Don't worry. Don't worry. I'll help you.

655
00:49:55,948 --> 00:49:57,866
Come on. Come on. You'll be OK.

656
00:50:05,667 --> 00:50:08,503
Washed up from a shipwreck.

657
00:50:08,586 --> 00:50:11,717
Oh, the poor thing.

658
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:15,054
We'll have you feeling better
in no time.

659
00:50:17,849 --> 00:50:21,936
I'll just... I'll just
get this washed for you.

660
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:28,484
Well, you must have at least
heard about this girl.

661
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:30,487
- No!
- Gertrude says...

662
00:50:30,529 --> 00:50:32,698
When has Gertrude ever
gotten anything right?

663
00:50:34,076 --> 00:50:36,037
- Really.
- Madam, please...

664
00:50:36,078 --> 00:50:39,540
She shows up in rags and doesn't speak.
Not my idea of a princess.

665
00:50:39,582 --> 00:50:41,667
If Eric's looking for a girl,

666
00:50:41,751 --> 00:50:45,213
I know a couple of highly
available ones right here.

667
00:50:57,478 --> 00:50:58,687
Oh, Eric, be reasonable.

668
00:50:58,739 --> 00:50:59,897
Oh, Eric, be reasonable.

669
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:03,526
Nice young ladies just don't
swim around rescuing people

670
00:51:03,610 --> 00:51:06,821
in the middle of the ocean
and then flitter off into oblivion...

671
00:51:06,905 --> 00:51:09,115
I'm tellin' ya, Grim. She was real.

672
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:12,535
I'm gonna find that girl,
and I'm gonna marry her.

673
00:51:12,577 --> 00:51:16,874
Come on, honey.
Don't be shy.

674
00:51:22,423 --> 00:51:26,344
Oh, Eric, isn't she a vision?

675
00:51:26,427 --> 00:51:29,430
Uh, you look wonderful.

676
00:51:29,472 --> 00:51:34,937
Come, come, come. You must be
famished. Let me help you, my dear.

677
00:51:34,978 --> 00:51:37,398
There we go. That's better.

678
00:51:37,439 --> 00:51:41,235
Now, quite comfy, hmm? Ha, ha.

679
00:51:41,318 --> 00:51:46,451
It's not often that we have
such a lovely dinner guest, eh, Eric?

680
00:51:57,963 --> 00:52:02,343
Uh, do you like it?
It is rather a fine one.

681
00:52:04,053 --> 00:52:05,974
Oh, my.

682
00:52:06,057 --> 00:52:07,892
Sorry, Grim.

683
00:52:07,976 --> 00:52:12,605
Why, Eric, that's the first time
I've seen you smile in weeks.

684
00:52:12,689 --> 00:52:15,275
Ah, very amusing.

685
00:52:15,316 --> 00:52:17,570
Carlotta, my dear, what's for dinner?

686
00:52:17,653 --> 00:52:19,155
Oh, you're gonna love it!

687
00:52:19,238 --> 00:52:22,950
Chef's been fixing
his speciality: Stuffed crab.

688
00:52:25,036 --> 00:52:28,289
â™ª Nouvelle cuisine â™ª

689
00:52:28,372 --> 00:52:30,334
â™ª Les Champs-ElysÃ©es â™ª

690
00:52:30,376 --> 00:52:33,881
â™ª Maurice Chevalier â™ª

691
00:52:35,966 --> 00:52:39,094
â™ª Les poissons, les poissons â™ª

692
00:52:39,178 --> 00:52:41,638
â™ª How I love les poissons â™ª

693
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:44,141
â™ª Love to chop and to serve little fish â™ª

694
00:52:44,183 --> 00:52:48,688
â™ª First I cut off their heads
Then I pull out their bones â™ª

695
00:52:48,772 --> 00:52:51,274
â™ª Ah, mais oui Ã§a c'est toujours delish â™ª

696
00:52:51,358 --> 00:52:52,986
â™ª Les poissons, les poissons â™ª

697
00:52:55,030 --> 00:52:58,367
â™ª With the cleaver I hack them in two â™ª

698
00:52:58,450 --> 00:53:01,453
â™ª I pull out what's inside
and I serve it up fried â™ª

699
00:53:01,536 --> 00:53:04,832
â™ª 'Cause I love little fishes
Don't you? â™ª

700
00:53:04,874 --> 00:53:08,503
â™ª Here's something for
tempting the palate â™ª

701
00:53:08,544 --> 00:53:10,797
â™ª Prepared in the classic technique â™ª

702
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:14,342
â™ª First you pound the fish flat
with the mallet â™ª

703
00:53:14,425 --> 00:53:18,014
â™ª Then you slash through the skin,
give the belly a slice â™ª

704
00:53:18,056 --> 00:53:19,850
â™ª Then you rub some salt in â™ª

705
00:53:19,934 --> 00:53:23,688
â™ª 'Cause that makes it taste nice â™ª

706
00:53:23,729 --> 00:53:28,401
- Oh.
- Zut alors! I have missed one.

707
00:53:28,484 --> 00:53:30,611
â™ª Sacrebleu! What is this? â™ª

708
00:53:30,695 --> 00:53:32,154
â™ª How on earth could I miss â™ª

709
00:53:32,238 --> 00:53:35,492
â™ª Such a sweet, little succulent crab? â™ª

710
00:53:35,575 --> 00:53:37,202
â™ª Quel dommage! What a loss â™ª

711
00:53:37,285 --> 00:53:38,706
â™ª Here we go, in the sauce â™ª

712
00:53:38,789 --> 00:53:41,709
â™ª Now some flour I think just a dab â™ª

713
00:53:41,792 --> 00:53:43,877
â™ª Now I'll stuff you with bread â™ª

714
00:53:43,961 --> 00:53:48,215
â™ª It don't hurt 'cause you're dead
and you're certainly lucky you are â™ª

715
00:53:48,298 --> 00:53:51,052
â™ª 'Cause it's gonna be hot
in my big silver pot â™ª

716
00:53:51,094 --> 00:53:54,556
â™ª Toodle-oo, mon poisson, au revoir â™ª

717
00:53:54,639 --> 00:53:55,953
Eh?

718
00:53:56,005 --> 00:53:57,267
Eh?

719
00:54:01,398 --> 00:54:05,361
What is this? Ow!

720
00:54:08,656 --> 00:54:11,951
Yeow! Oh, ow, ow, oh!

721
00:54:33,642 --> 00:54:38,148
I think I'd better go see
what Louis is up to.

722
00:54:40,192 --> 00:54:44,237
Come out, you little pipsqueak,
and fight like a man!

723
00:54:44,321 --> 00:54:46,909
- Louis!
- Ow.

724
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:51,998
- What are you doing?
- Well, I was just, uh...

725
00:54:52,082 --> 00:54:56,294
I'm sorry, madame.

726
00:54:56,378 --> 00:54:59,339
You know, Eric, perhaps
our young guest might enjoy

727
00:54:59,381 --> 00:55:01,966
seeing some of the sights
of the kingdom.

728
00:55:02,050 --> 00:55:03,968
Something in the way of a tour.

729
00:55:04,052 --> 00:55:07,098
I'm sorry, Grim.
What was that?

730
00:55:07,181 --> 00:55:10,269
You can't spend all your time
moping about. You need to get out.

731
00:55:10,353 --> 00:55:12,522
- Do something. Have a life.
- Shh!

732
00:55:12,605 --> 00:55:14,524
- Get your mind off...
- Easy, Grim, easy.

733
00:55:14,607 --> 00:55:17,819
It's not a bad idea,
if she's interested.

734
00:55:17,902 --> 00:55:19,278
Well, what do ya say?

735
00:55:19,362 --> 00:55:22,449
Would you like to join me on
a tour of my kingdom tomorrow?

736
00:55:22,533 --> 00:55:27,663
Wonderful! Now, let's eat before
this crab wanders off my plate.

737
00:55:35,798 --> 00:55:37,718
Come here, boy.

738
00:55:54,944 --> 00:55:58,074
This has got to be, without a doubt,

739
00:55:58,158 --> 00:56:02,662
the single most humiliating
day of my life.

740
00:56:02,746 --> 00:56:08,210
I hope that you appreciate what I go
through for you, young lady.

741
00:56:08,294 --> 00:56:12,339
Now, we got to make a plan
to get that boy to kiss you.

742
00:56:12,423 --> 00:56:17,511
Tomorrow when he takes you for that
ride, you gotta look your best.

743
00:56:17,595 --> 00:56:22,101
You gotta bat your eyes, like this.

744
00:56:22,143 --> 00:56:27,441
You gotta pucker up your lips,
like this.

745
00:56:30,277 --> 00:56:32,863
Hmm.

746
00:56:37,493 --> 00:56:42,751
You are hopeless, child. You know that?

747
00:56:42,834 --> 00:56:46,463
Completely hopeless.

748
00:56:54,972 --> 00:56:56,391
Any sign of them?

749
00:56:56,474 --> 00:56:59,560
No, Your Majesty.
We searched everywhere.

750
00:56:59,644 --> 00:57:02,939
We've found no trace of
your daughter or Sebastian.

751
00:57:03,022 --> 00:57:07,278
Keep looking. Leave no shell unturned,
no coral unexplored.

752
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:11,492
Let no one in this kingdom sleep
until she's safe at home.

753
00:57:11,575 --> 00:57:13,577
Yes, sire.

754
00:57:14,829 --> 00:57:20,126
Oh, what have I done?
What have I done?

755
00:57:43,832 --> 00:57:45,208
Has he kissed her yet?

756
00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:47,711
- Not yet.
- Oh!

757
00:57:53,719 --> 00:57:55,722
Oh, Judy!

758
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,910
Yo! Flounder! Any kissing?

759
00:58:13,951 --> 00:58:16,454
No, not yet.

760
00:58:16,495 --> 00:58:18,956
Well, they'd better get crackin'!

761
00:58:47,656 --> 00:58:50,033
Move over.
Move your big feathers.

762
00:58:50,116 --> 00:58:51,785
I can't see a thing.

763
00:58:51,868 --> 00:58:55,038
Nothing is happening.

764
00:58:55,121 --> 00:59:00,380
Only one day left, and that boy
ain't puckered up once.

765
00:59:00,463 --> 00:59:06,970
OK. All right, this calls for
a little vocal romantic stimulation.

766
00:59:07,011 --> 00:59:10,056
Stand back!

767
00:59:10,139 --> 00:59:15,396
Wa, wa, wa, wa-wa!

768
00:59:15,479 --> 00:59:20,067
Wow. Somebody should find that poor
animal and put it out of its misery.

769
00:59:20,150 --> 00:59:22,236
Wa, wa, wa-wa!

770
00:59:22,319 --> 00:59:25,324
Wa, wa, wa, wa-wa!

771
00:59:25,366 --> 00:59:29,871
Geez, man. I'm surrounded by amateurs.

772
00:59:29,955 --> 00:59:31,915
Wa, wa, wa, wa!

773
00:59:31,999 --> 00:59:35,752
You want something done
you've got to do it yourself.

774
00:59:35,836 --> 00:59:40,924
First we got to create the mood.

775
00:59:41,008 --> 00:59:44,137
Percussion.

776
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:47,851
Strings. Winds.

777
00:59:47,934 --> 00:59:50,228
Words.

778
00:59:50,312 --> 00:59:53,231
â™ª There you see her â™ª

779
00:59:53,273 --> 00:59:56,526
â™ª Sitting there across the way â™ª

780
00:59:56,568 --> 00:59:58,988
â™ª She don't got a lot to say â™ª

781
00:59:59,071 --> 01:00:03,200
â™ª But there's something about her â™ª

782
01:00:03,242 --> 01:00:06,662
â™ª And you don't know why
but you're dyin' to try â™ª

783
01:00:06,746 --> 01:00:08,706
â™ª You wanna kiss the girl â™ª

784
01:00:08,748 --> 01:00:11,461
Did you hear something?

785
01:00:11,544 --> 01:00:14,298
â™ª Yes, you want her â™ª

786
01:00:14,381 --> 01:00:18,052
â™ª Look at her
You know you do â™ª

787
01:00:18,093 --> 01:00:20,054
â™ª Possible she want you too â™ª

788
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:24,350
â™ª There is one way to ask her â™ª

789
01:00:24,433 --> 01:00:26,518
â™ª It don't take a word â™ª

790
01:00:26,602 --> 01:00:30,774
â™ª Not a single word
Go on and kiss the girl â™ª

791
01:00:30,857 --> 01:00:32,402
Sing with me now.

792
01:00:32,444 --> 01:00:35,364
â™ª Sha-la-la-la-la-la
My, oh, my â™ª

793
01:00:35,447 --> 01:00:39,701
â™ª Look like the boy too shy
He ain't gonna kiss the girl â™ª

794
01:00:39,785 --> 01:00:42,537
â™ª Sha-la-la-la-la-la
Ain't that sad? â™ª

795
01:00:42,621 --> 01:00:44,123
â™ª Ain't it a shame? â™ª

796
01:00:44,207 --> 01:00:48,253
â™ª Too bad he gonna miss the girl â™ª

797
01:00:48,336 --> 01:00:50,546
You know, I feel really bad
not knowing your name.

798
01:00:50,630 --> 01:00:54,592
Maybe I could guess. Is it Mildred?

799
01:00:54,676 --> 01:00:58,265
OK, no.

800
01:00:58,348 --> 01:01:01,435
How about Diana? Rachel?

801
01:01:01,477 --> 01:01:05,523
- Ariel. Her name is Ariel.
- Ariel?

802
01:01:05,606 --> 01:01:08,859
Ariel? Oh.

803
01:01:08,943 --> 01:01:13,114
That's kind of pretty. OK. Ariel.

804
01:01:13,355 --> 01:01:17,452
â™ª Now's your moment â™ª

805
01:01:17,494 --> 01:01:20,124
â™ª Floating in a blue lagoon â™ª

806
01:01:20,165 --> 01:01:22,751
â™ª Boy, you better do it soon â™ª

807
01:01:22,835 --> 01:01:27,131
- â™ª No time will be better â™ª
- â™ª Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya â™ª

808
01:01:27,172 --> 01:01:29,383
â™ª She don't say a word â™ª

809
01:01:29,467 --> 01:01:32,596
â™ª And she won't say a word
until ya kiss the girl â™ª

810
01:01:35,432 --> 01:01:37,934
â™ª Sha-la-la-la-la-la
Don't be scared â™ª

811
01:01:38,018 --> 01:01:42,107
â™ª You got the mood prepared
Go on and kiss the girl â™ª

812
01:01:42,190 --> 01:01:44,651
â™ª Sha-la-la-la-la-la
Don't stop now â™ª

813
01:01:44,735 --> 01:01:48,239
â™ª Don't try to hide it
how you wanna kiss the girl â™ª

814
01:01:48,323 --> 01:01:49,657
â™ª Whoa, whoa â™ª

815
01:01:49,699 --> 01:01:51,993
â™ª Sha-la-la-la-la-la
Float along â™ª

816
01:01:52,035 --> 01:01:53,953
- â™ª And listen to the song
- Wa, wa, wa, wa-wa! â™ª

817
01:01:54,037 --> 01:01:57,165
- â™ª Song say kiss the girl â™ª
- â™ª Whoa, whoa â™ª

818
01:01:57,206 --> 01:01:59,459
â™ª Sha-la-la-la-la-la
Music play â™ª

819
01:01:59,542 --> 01:02:02,922
â™ª Do what the music say
You gotta kiss the girl â™ª

820
01:02:04,550 --> 01:02:06,260
â™ª Kiss the girl â™ª

821
01:02:06,344 --> 01:02:09,764
- â™ª Why don't you â™ª
- â™ª Kiss the girl? â™ª

822
01:02:09,847 --> 01:02:14,518
â™ª Go on and kiss the girl â™ª

823
01:02:14,602 --> 01:02:18,732
- Go on and...
- â™ª Kiss the girl â™ª

824
01:02:21,151 --> 01:02:24,738
- Whoa!
- Hang on, I've got ya.

825
01:02:26,156 --> 01:02:28,577
Nice work, boys.

826
01:02:28,619 --> 01:02:30,621
That was a close one. Too close.

827
01:02:30,673 --> 01:02:32,624
That was a close one. Too close.

828
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:37,671
The little tramp!
Ah, she's better than I thought.

829
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:42,050
Well, at this rate, he'll be
kissing her by sunset for sure.

830
01:02:42,092 --> 01:02:46,806
Well, it's time Ursula took
matters into her own tentacles.

831
01:02:46,889 --> 01:02:51,479
Triton's daughter will be mine!
And then I'll make him writhe.

832
01:02:51,562 --> 01:02:54,941
I'll see him wriggle
like a worm on a hook!

833
01:03:15,715 --> 01:03:19,011
Eric? If I may say,

834
01:03:19,094 --> 01:03:23,223
far better than any dream girl
is one of flesh and blood,

835
01:03:23,307 --> 01:03:28,520
one warm and caring
and right before your eyes.

836
01:04:18,662 --> 01:04:20,664
Ariel!

837
01:04:20,747 --> 01:04:25,170
Ariel, wake up! Wake up.
I just heard the news. Congratulations.

838
01:04:25,212 --> 01:04:27,339
Kiddo, we did it!

839
01:04:27,381 --> 01:04:31,009
What is this idiot babbling about?

840
01:04:31,093 --> 01:04:33,888
Right, as if you two didn't know, huh?

841
01:04:33,972 --> 01:04:39,310
The whole town's buzzin' about the
prince gettin' hitched this afternoon!

842
01:04:39,394 --> 01:04:41,646
You know, he's getting married.

843
01:04:41,729 --> 01:04:45,819
You silly side-walker.
I just wanted to wish ya luck.

844
01:04:45,902 --> 01:04:48,738
I'll catch ya later. I wouldn't miss it!

845
01:05:04,130 --> 01:05:06,091
Well, now, Eric.

846
01:05:06,133 --> 01:05:08,721
It appears that I was mistaken.

847
01:05:08,762 --> 01:05:13,892
This mystery maiden of yours
does, in fact, exist.

848
01:05:13,934 --> 01:05:16,812
A-And she is lovely.

849
01:05:16,895 --> 01:05:19,315
Congratulations, my dear.

850
01:05:19,398 --> 01:05:22,277
We wish to be married
as soon as possible.

851
01:05:22,319 --> 01:05:26,364
Oh, yes, of course, Eric, but,
uh, these things do take time, you know.

852
01:05:26,448 --> 01:05:30,118
This afternoon, Grimsby.
The wedding ship departs at sunset.

853
01:05:30,201 --> 01:05:35,251
Oh. Oh. Very well, Eric,
uh, as you wish.

854
01:06:32,190 --> 01:06:35,318
â™ª What a lovely
little bride I'll make â™ª

855
01:06:35,402 --> 01:06:38,364
â™ª My dear, I'll look divine â™ª

856
01:06:40,074 --> 01:06:41,369
â™ª Things are working out â™ª

857
01:06:41,452 --> 01:06:45,331
â™ª According to my ultimate design â™ª

858
01:06:47,041 --> 01:06:49,836
â™ª Soon I'll have that little mermaid â™ª

859
01:06:49,877 --> 01:06:53,716
â™ª And the ocean will be mine â™ª

860
01:06:57,386 --> 01:07:02,224
The sea witch! Oh, no!
She's gonna... I gotta...

861
01:07:02,266 --> 01:07:04,603
Ariel!

862
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:07,774
Ariel!

863
01:07:07,858 --> 01:07:12,321
Ariel, I was flying...
Of course, I was flying. And...

864
01:07:12,404 --> 01:07:17,034
I saw the... the watch...
The witch was watching the mirror,

865
01:07:17,117 --> 01:07:20,787
and she was singin'
with a stolen set of pipes.

866
01:07:20,871 --> 01:07:23,625
Do you hear what I'm tellin' you?

867
01:07:23,708 --> 01:07:29,049
The prince is marrying
the sea witch in disguise!

868
01:07:29,090 --> 01:07:32,385
- Are you sure about this?
- Have I ever been wrong?

869
01:07:32,427 --> 01:07:34,429
I mean, when it's important?

870
01:07:34,512 --> 01:07:37,015
What are we gonna do?

871
01:07:37,098 --> 01:07:40,811
Before the sun
sets on the third day.

872
01:07:40,895 --> 01:07:43,272
Day...

873
01:07:47,610 --> 01:07:50,114
Ariel, grab onto that.

874
01:07:50,156 --> 01:07:53,994
Flounder, get her to that boat
as fast as your fins can carry you.

875
01:07:54,078 --> 01:07:56,038
I'll try!

876
01:07:56,121 --> 01:07:58,707
I gotta get to the sea king.
He must know about this.

877
01:07:58,791 --> 01:08:00,834
- What about me? What about me?
- You!

878
01:08:00,918 --> 01:08:04,296
Find a way to stall that wedding!

879
01:08:04,338 --> 01:08:06,298
Stall the wedding. W-What am I?

880
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:09,094
What? That's it!

881
01:08:18,522 --> 01:08:20,065
Let's go!

882
01:08:20,148 --> 01:08:22,776
We got an emergency here.

883
01:08:34,789 --> 01:08:36,751
Dearly beloved...

884
01:08:36,835 --> 01:08:42,174
Don't worry, Ariel.
We're gonna make it.

885
01:08:42,216 --> 01:08:44,176
We're almost there.

886
01:08:44,218 --> 01:08:48,139
Yes, um, do you, Eric, take Vanessa...

887
01:08:48,180 --> 01:08:51,434
to be your lawfully wedded wife

888
01:08:51,517 --> 01:08:54,103
for as long as you both shall live?

889
01:08:54,186 --> 01:08:56,356
I do.

890
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:58,444
It being... And do you...

891
01:09:07,536 --> 01:09:08,787
Oh!

892
01:09:10,874 --> 01:09:13,501
Oh! Oh! Oh!

893
01:09:17,088 --> 01:09:18,506
Then by the power...

894
01:09:18,548 --> 01:09:20,675
Get away, you slimy...

895
01:09:20,717 --> 01:09:22,346
Oh!

896
01:09:25,725 --> 01:09:28,394
Oh!

897
01:09:29,812 --> 01:09:33,733
Oh!

898
01:09:33,816 --> 01:09:36,277
Oh, why, you little...

899
01:09:47,917 --> 01:09:49,502
Huh?

900
01:09:57,135 --> 01:09:59,179
Ariel?

901
01:09:59,262 --> 01:10:02,474
Eric.

902
01:10:02,557 --> 01:10:04,643
You... You can talk?

903
01:10:04,726 --> 01:10:08,691
- You're the one.
- Eric, get away from her.

904
01:10:08,774 --> 01:10:12,529
- It was you all the time.
- Eric, I wanted to tell you.

905
01:10:12,612 --> 01:10:16,741
Eric, no!

906
01:10:16,783 --> 01:10:19,744
You're too late!

907
01:10:19,786 --> 01:10:22,414
You're too late!

908
01:10:28,170 --> 01:10:32,427
So long, lover boy.

909
01:10:32,510 --> 01:10:35,221
- Ariel!
- Poor little princess.

910
01:10:35,304 --> 01:10:38,224
It's not you I'm after.
I've a much bigger fish to...

911
01:10:38,308 --> 01:10:41,602
- Ursula, stop!
- Hmph!

912
01:10:41,644 --> 01:10:46,984
Why, King Triton!
How are you?

913
01:10:47,026 --> 01:10:50,612
- Let her go!
- Not a chance! She's mine now!

914
01:10:50,654 --> 01:10:53,868
- We made a deal.
- Daddy, I'm sorry! I-I...

915
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:57,372
I didn't mean to! I didn't know!

916
01:11:00,834 --> 01:11:02,127
You see?

917
01:11:02,169 --> 01:11:05,505
The contract's legal, binding
and completely unbreakable,

918
01:11:05,589 --> 01:11:07,591
even for you.

919
01:11:07,674 --> 01:11:13,139
Of course, I always was a girl
with an eye for a bargain.

920
01:11:13,181 --> 01:11:18,563
The daughter of the great sea king
is a very precious commodity.

921
01:11:18,646 --> 01:11:22,817
But I might be willing
to make an exchange

922
01:11:22,901 --> 01:11:26,863
for someone even better.

923
01:11:26,905 --> 01:11:28,658
Eric, what are you doing?

924
01:11:28,741 --> 01:11:32,453
Grim, I lost her once.
I'm not gonna lose her again!

925
01:11:32,536 --> 01:11:37,124
Now, do we have a deal?

926
01:11:39,671 --> 01:11:42,757
Ha! It's done then!

927
01:11:44,718 --> 01:11:47,846
No! Oh, no!

928
01:11:56,397 --> 01:11:58,524
Your Majesty.

929
01:11:58,565 --> 01:11:59,859
Daddy.

930
01:11:59,901 --> 01:12:04,408
- At last... it's mine.
- No.

931
01:12:06,618 --> 01:12:10,872
You!

932
01:12:10,956 --> 01:12:12,165
You monster!

933
01:12:12,249 --> 01:12:14,419
Don't fool with me, ya little brat!

934
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:17,422
Contract or no, I'll blast... Ow!

935
01:12:17,463 --> 01:12:20,049
- Why, you little fool.
- Eric! Eric, look out!

936
01:12:20,133 --> 01:12:22,093
After him!

937
01:12:28,685 --> 01:12:31,605
Come on!

938
01:12:31,647 --> 01:12:34,400
Ow!

939
01:12:35,901 --> 01:12:39,196
Say goodbye to your sweetheart.

940
01:12:43,951 --> 01:12:48,667
Babies! My poor little poopsies.

941
01:12:58,677 --> 01:13:01,431
Eric, you've gotta get away from here.

942
01:13:01,514 --> 01:13:03,767
No, I won't leave you.

943
01:13:21,329 --> 01:13:26,209
You pitiful, insignificant fools!

944
01:13:26,292 --> 01:13:28,252
Look out!

945
01:13:30,004 --> 01:13:32,966
Now I am the ruler of all the ocean!

946
01:13:33,008 --> 01:13:36,639
The waves obey my every whim!

947
01:13:36,722 --> 01:13:40,810
Eric!

948
01:13:40,893 --> 01:13:46,608
The sea and all its spoils
bow to my power!

949
01:14:05,380 --> 01:14:07,924
Eric!

950
01:14:30,533 --> 01:14:32,453
Oh! Oh!

951
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:45,009
So much for true love!

952
01:15:42,491 --> 01:15:46,537
She really does love him,
doesn't she, Sebastian?

953
01:15:46,620 --> 01:15:52,502
Mmm. Well, it's like
I always say, Your Majesty,

954
01:15:52,585 --> 01:15:57,551
children got to be free
to lead their own lives.

955
01:15:57,634 --> 01:15:59,553
You always say that?

956
01:16:02,472 --> 01:16:06,769
Then I guess
there's just one problem left.

957
01:16:06,853 --> 01:16:08,980
And what's that, Your Majesty?

958
01:16:09,022 --> 01:16:12,650
How much I'm going to miss her.

959
01:17:11,552 --> 01:17:13,930
Ah-ha!

960
01:17:21,605 --> 01:17:25,694
Yes!

961
01:17:25,778 --> 01:17:27,655
Thank you. Thank you.

962
01:17:37,624 --> 01:17:39,251
I love you, Daddy.

963
01:17:39,334 --> 01:17:43,672
â™ª Now we can walk
Now we can run â™ª

964
01:17:43,755 --> 01:17:49,138
â™ª Now we can stay all day in the sun â™ª

965
01:17:50,305 --> 01:17:54,769
â™ª Just you and me â™ª

966
01:17:54,811 --> 01:17:59,232
â™ª And I can be â™ª

967
01:17:59,315 --> 01:18:05,905
â™ª Part of your world â™ª

968
