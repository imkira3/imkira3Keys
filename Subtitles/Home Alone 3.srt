Computer chip, huh?
Where'd you find it?

493
00:48:27,849 --> 00:48:31,853
In a remote-control car I got
for shoveling snow for Mrs. Hess.

494
00:48:32,061 --> 00:48:33,771
She lives across the street.

495

It says U.S. Air Force...

496
00:48:35,648 --> 00:48:38,776
...but you have to look
under a magnifying glass to see.

Kid, a lot of toys have
"Air Force" written on it.

Can I give you the chip number
to give to the right guys?

about the chip?

I'll have Jernigan to thank.

into his own hands.

across the street...

984
01:33:19,374 --> 01:33:22,168
...who needs some soup
and a doctor to look at her feet.

985
01:33:22,418 --> 01:33:25,088
There's two in our pool
and one in our basement.

986
01:33:25,630 --> 01:33:27,340
The other one's gone.

987
01:33:32,929 --> 01:33:34,305
Is this him?

988
01:33:35,932 --> 01:33:36,766
Yep.

989
01:33:39,185 --> 01:33:41,938
Seven years, I've been after this guy.

990
01:33:42,897 --> 01:33:45,274
He always manages to slip away.

991
01:33:48,277 --> 01:33:49,529
Thanks.

992
01:33:54,742 --> 01:33:56,869
- It's just the three.
- Where's your boss?

993
01:33:58,579 --> 01:34:01,582
- Get them out of here!
- Yes, sir. Let's go, popsicle.

994
01:34:01,833 --> 01:34:03,209
Come on.

995
01:34:07,255 --> 01:34:09,882
(PARROT SQUAWKS)

996
01:34:15,888 --> 01:34:18,850
Lucy, I'm home!

997
01:34:20,184 --> 01:34:22,812
What's on your mind, monkey butt?

998
01:34:23,229 --> 01:34:25,440
Bad, bad, Leroy Brown

999
01:34:36,159 --> 01:34:39,078
Houston, we have a problem.

1000
01:34:39,579 --> 01:34:40,788
Counting down in...

1001
01:34:40,997 --> 01:34:45,668
...five, four, three, two...

1002
01:34:45,918 --> 01:34:46,878
Take it.

1003
01:34:47,462 --> 01:34:48,504
Double or nothing.

1004
01:34:49,255 --> 01:34:51,049
I only have one.

1005
01:34:53,551 --> 01:34:55,553
We have ignition.

1006
01:34:59,724 --> 01:35:01,059
It's showtime!

1007
01:35:01,893 --> 01:35:03,227
(FIRECRACKERS EXPLODING)

1008
01:35:15,948 --> 01:35:19,160
I'll be there in just a minute.
Okay, bye.

1009
01:35:19,410 --> 01:35:22,622
It's the Tudor with the Christmas
lights in the driveway...

1010
01:35:22,830 --> 01:35:24,832
...that hasn't been shoveled.

1011
01:35:25,083 --> 01:35:26,459
That one, right there.

1012
01:35:27,126 --> 01:35:27,960
Oh.

1013
01:35:31,172 --> 01:35:32,256
Oh.

1014
01:35:32,465 --> 01:35:35,176
(HAMMERING)

1015
01:35:37,261 --> 01:35:39,180
Have you ever had the chickenpox?

1016
01:35:39,430 --> 01:35:44,352
I had the chickenpox when
Herbert Hoover was in the White House.

1017
01:35:45,228 --> 01:35:46,270
Hello.

1018
01:35:46,479 --> 01:35:48,314
GROUP:
Hello.

1019
01:35:48,815 --> 01:35:49,941
Dad!

1020
01:35:51,484 --> 01:35:53,361
Hey, come here.

1021
01:35:57,865 --> 01:36:01,119
Let's see. You don't look
any worse for the wear.

1022
01:36:01,369 --> 01:36:02,829
They couldn't touch me.

1023
01:36:03,079 --> 01:36:06,499
The computer company with the boosted
chip is giving Alex a reward.

1024
01:36:06,708 --> 01:36:09,502
It's a six-figure sum,
which is extremely cool.

1025
01:36:11,129 --> 01:36:12,964
So did you bring me anything?

1026
01:36:13,589 --> 01:36:15,717
As a matter of fact, I did.

1027
01:36:16,634 --> 01:36:17,719
Come here.

1028
01:36:20,221 --> 01:36:21,681
Think you can drive that?

1029
01:36:21,931 --> 01:36:24,183
I think we can handle it.

1030
01:36:24,600 --> 01:36:27,103
Gentlemen, start your engines.

1031
01:36:27,353 --> 01:36:28,980
360! 360!

1032
01:36:32,734 --> 01:36:33,985
Rat overboard!

1033
01:36:36,112 --> 01:36:37,530
Say cheese.

1034
01:36:38,305 --> 01:37:38,531
