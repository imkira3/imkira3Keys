2
00:00:38,622 --> 00:00:40,665
Well, Dmitri.

3
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,209
Every search for a hero

4
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:46,879
must begin with something
that every hero requires,

5
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:49,340
a villain.

6
00:00:50,134 --> 00:00:54,971
Therefore in a search for
our hero, Bellerophon

7
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,973
we created a monster.

8
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,060
Chimera.

9
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:08,234
I beg you, Dmitri,
come to Sydney

10
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:11,028
and accompany me to
Atlanta immediately.

11
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:12,655
However we travel,

12
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:16,993
I must arrive at my destination
within 20 hours of departure.

13
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,133
Ring around the rosie.

14
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:34,927
A pocket full of posies.

15
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:37,930
Ashes, ashes.

16
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:40,558
We all fall down.

17
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:51,527
Folks, we're two and a
half hours from Atlanta.

18
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:55,406
Look out your window now. We have a
great view of the Rocky Mountains.

19
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,912
You keep staring at that watch as if
your life depended on it, Doctor.

20
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,039
Well, yes.

21
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,666
I suppose I'm a bit anxious.

22
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:08,211
You'll soon be with old friends.

23
00:02:08,504 --> 00:02:11,005
I'm with an old
friend now, Dmitri.

24
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,134
I'm sorry it couldn't be
under happier circumstances.

25
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:16,552
I'm sorry too.

26
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:19,222
You are sorry, and I am sorry.

27
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,937
You don't know Gradski
thought the world of you.

28
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,396
Did he

29
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:29,565
know

30
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:32,401
before the end that you
two had succeeded?

31
00:02:32,528 --> 00:02:34,904
Yes, he knew. Just.

32
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:37,865
Not in time to save him?

33
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,450
No.

34
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:43,621
After you've been infected
with Chimera for 20 hours

35
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:45,456
nothing can save you

36
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:47,708
not even Bellerophon.

37
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,962
You can carry them together

38
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:53,714
safely?

39
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:54,924
Yes.

40
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:59,929
And you'll get us to safe place
with them in Atlanta, thank God.

41
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:02,640
This is your Captain again.

42
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:06,310
We've experienced a slight but
abrupt drop in cabin pressure.

43
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:09,063
As a precaution, I've
released the oxygen masks.

44
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:12,275
Please put them on,
sit back, relax.

45
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:14,652
There's nothing to worry about.

46
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:18,948
Are you concerned?

47
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,284
Not so far.

48
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,119
Just put on your oxygen mask.

49
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:25,580
- I'll see what's going on.
- Okay.

50
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:36,966
Denver Centre, this is
Transpac 2207, 747 heavy.

51
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:40,094
We're unable to maintain
cabin pressurisation.

52
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:43,472
We've initiated a
descent to 1-6000.

53
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:45,975
Captain...

54
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:14,879
God.

55
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:29,352
It seems we have a
problem, Dmitri.

56
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,812
You keep calling me Dmitri.

57
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:34,857
You really shouldn't.

58
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:37,485
You are not Dmitri?

59
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:51,874
No.

60
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:55,336
Wallis,

61
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,338
hold on to this.

62
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:10,393
Ulrich, remember to pull the...

63
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:16,315
Remember to pull the
NO2 tank and dump it.

64
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,025
All done, chief.

65
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:23,030
Terrain. Terrain.

66
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:26,158
Pull up. Pull up. Terrain.

67
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,498
Seven nine nine!

68
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,501
Checkpoint Charlie,
three, two, one!

69
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,044
Go!

70
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,845
Terrain. Terrain.

71
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:47,722
Pull up. Pull up.

72
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,682
Terrain. Terrain.

73
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,059
Pull up. Pull up.

74
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:18,933
Good morning, Mr Hunt.

75
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:20,851
Your mission, should you
choose to accept it

76
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:23,270
involves the recovery
of a stolen item

77
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:24,980
designated Chimera.

78
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:27,650
You may select any two team
members but it is essential

79
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:31,195
that the third team member
be Nyah Nordoff-Hall.

80
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,863
She is a civilian

81
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:35,407
and a highly capable
professional thief.

82
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:38,160
You have 48 hours to
recruit Miss Nordoff-Hall

83
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:40,955
and meet me in Seville to
receive your assignment.

84
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:44,541
As always, should you or any member
of your IMF team be caught or killed

85
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:48,212
the Secretary will disavow all
knowledge of your actions.

86
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:50,965
And, Mr Hunt, the next
time you go on holiday

87
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:54,134
please let us know
where you're going.

88
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:57,263
This message will self-destruct
in five seconds.

89
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:59,723
If I let you know
where I'm going

90
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,559
then I won't be on holiday.

91
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,568
I see you found it.

92
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:44,490
What are you doing here?

93
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:47,159
Think you're the only one
who can pick a lock?

94
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,580
Not just a pretty
face after all.

95
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:11,600
Do you mind if I'm on top?

96
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,020
Either way works for me.

97
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:42,464
- You'll never find it there.
- Damn it.

98
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,135
- Find what?
- His ex's Bulgari necklace.

99
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,638
It goes up for
auction on Tuesday.

100
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,979
And are you going to
tell me where it is?

101
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,399
Far left.

102
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:14,830
This is very disconcerting.

103
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:18,542
Hey, you put me here. I
just do as I'm told.

104
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:20,752
Right.

105
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,030
Now

106
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:52,117
who are you and what's
it gonna cost me?

107
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:54,202
I wouldn't do that.

108
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:55,537
What?

109
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:58,373
That.

110
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,885
Mr Keys, it is you.

111
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:13,055
It is Mr Keys, our security engineer.
Apologise!

112
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,140
No, no need to apologise.

113
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:18,977
Miss Hall, my associate, has your
necklace in a very safe place

114
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:22,689
but obviously we do feel the alarm
should have gone off a little sooner.

115
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:24,733
Isn't that right, Miss Hall?

116
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:28,403
Oh, absolutely. Much,
much too long, I'd say.

117
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:35,911
We'd recommend resetting the sensors
to respond to a lighter load.

118
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,914
How do you feel about
40 kilos, Miss Hall?

119
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:40,290
Perfect.

120
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:43,752
Shall we?

121
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,590
Miss Hall,

122
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:52,260
haven't you forgotten something?

123
00:16:56,808 --> 00:17:00,477
What are you trying to
do, senorita, rob me?

124
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:02,979
The thought had crossed my mind.

125
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,984
I'm missing something here, aside
from my half million pound necklace.

126
00:17:08,111 --> 00:17:10,821
Even after I screwed up the job, I
could have walked out with the thing.

127
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:11,988
At least you walked.

128
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:14,991
If you weren't going to let me get away
with it, why did you watch me do it?

129
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:16,368
I wanted to see how
good you were.

130
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,829
I was hoping we might
work together.

131
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:20,497
Sounds terrific.

132
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:27,212
Now be serious. Whatever
you're talking about,

133
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,047
you couldn't want me
after that performance.

134
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:32,467
- You didn't do that badly.
- You apologising for me?

135
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,803
Quite the gentleman.

136
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:36,471
Not really.

137
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,474
I triggered the alarm.

138
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:44,479
Sorry.

139
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,319
I don't do laundry, cook

140
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:54,072
or put up with cheeky bastards
who set me up on their territory

141
00:17:54,157 --> 00:17:55,866
so they can poach on mine.

142
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,517
- Hello.
- Hi.

143
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,061
Would you mind slowing down?

144
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:30,692
Where did you get this number?
I don't even have it.

145
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:34,029
Would you like it?

146
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:55,967
Pull over and listen to me, will you?
Just listen.

147
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:58,804
- Listen to what?
- I need your help.

148
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:01,973
- I think you could use mine.
- Your help?

149
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:03,433
What are you talking about?

150
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:06,394
I'm talking about
Scotland Yard, interpol

151
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,396
every Dutch authority.

152
00:19:09,232 --> 00:19:11,149
I can make them all go away.

153
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:12,818
Oh, bloody hell.

154
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:14,402
You're a spy!

155
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:17,739
Well, if you want me,
you've gotta catch me.

156
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:41,471
You having fun?

157
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,210
Sorry.

158
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,539
Watch the road.

159
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:13,521
What's your name?

160
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:16,691
Ethan Hunt.

161
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,444
Well, Ethan Hunt

162
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:23,949
what is it you want
to talk to me about?

163
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:26,952
A lot more than I thought.

164
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:32,540
Awfully short notice.

165
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,585
Care to wait a decent interval?

166
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,129
Who wants to be decent?

167
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:38,106
So what have you
got against spies?

168
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:41,276
When they've got your
recruiting technique

169
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,819
nothing.

170
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:47,866
- This wasn't exactly by the book.
- They've got a book for this?

171
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:50,368
They've got a book
for everything.

172
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:54,039
So this thing these
blokes pinched...

173
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,791
I don't know that
they pinched it.

174
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:59,669
I don't even know
that they're blokes.

175
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:03,214
What am I doing here?

176
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:09,387
I thought I was supposed to be some
kind of thief to catch a thief.

177
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,139
So did I.

178
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:13,850
Sort of.

179
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,526
Damn, you're beautiful.

180
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:39,811
Espresso? Cappuccino?

181
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,396
No, thanks.

182
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:43,398
Sit down.

183
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:46,276
Festival's a pain in the ass.

184
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:48,695
Honouring their saints
by setting them on fire.

185
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:51,072
Lets you know what they think
of saints, doesn't it?

186
00:24:51,157 --> 00:24:54,075
Damn near set me on fire
on my way over here.

187
00:24:56,579 --> 00:24:58,746
Sorry, I barged in
on your vacation.

188
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:02,917
- Sorry I didn't tell you where I was.
- Wouldn't be a vacation if you did.

189
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:05,420
Well, you're sorry,
and I'm sorry.

190
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:10,925
- Why did you phrase it like that?
- Like what?

191
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,261
"You're sorry. I'm sorry."

192
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:16,306
You gotta be kidding.

193
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:25,106
Well, Dmitri

194
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,775
once again I need your help

195
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,028
just as in the old days, huh?

196
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:34,199
When you saved our lives,
saved our very sanity.

197
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:41,289
We have this little problem.

198
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:44,876
Every search for a hero

199
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:48,796
must begin with something
that every hero requires,

200
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:50,215
a villain.

201
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:55,303
Therefore in a search for
our hero, Bellerophon

202
00:25:56,013 --> 00:25:58,139
we created a monster.

203
00:25:58,724 --> 00:25:59,974
Chimera.

204
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:04,187
I beg you, Dmitri,
come to Sydney

205
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:07,732
and accompany me to
Atlanta immediately.

206
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:09,817
However we travel,

207
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:14,489
I must arrive at my destination
within 20 hours of departure.

208
00:26:15,658 --> 00:26:19,661
I fear I can entrust
this to no one but you.

209
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:26,167
As we say, I'm sorry,
and you are sorry.

210
00:26:26,669 --> 00:26:28,962
Do you have any idea what the
hell he's talking about?

211
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:30,672
An idea? Yeah.

212
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:33,675
- Like?
- It's a good idea to get him now.

213
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:38,179
A bad idea to fly him on a commercial
carrier. Is he still in Sydney?

214
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:41,015
Dr Vladimir Nekhorvich is dead.

215
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:46,187
So is his colleague Gradski,
but that happened earlier.

216
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:48,731
We had Nekhorvich on
a flight from Sydney

217
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:50,942
that crashed in the Rockies.

218
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,527
Dead.

219
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:54,696
Are you listening to me?

220
00:26:56,282 --> 00:26:59,200
If he didn't want to
go anywhere without me

221
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,537
how did you get him
on that flight?

222
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,205
You were there.

223
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:14,215
When I couldn't find you,
I had to replace you.

224
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,634
Sean Ambrose was the
obvious choice.

225
00:27:16,719 --> 00:27:19,137
He doubled you two
or three times.

226
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,100
- Twice.
- What did you think of him?

227
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:31,691
We had reservations about each other.
It's a bit late to be asking me that.

228
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:33,401
No, not necessarily.

229
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,069
Airline records

230
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:39,824
list a Captain Harold Macintosh
as the pilot of flight 2207.

231
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:43,786
As far as the media and all the
governmental agencies are concerned.

232
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:46,456
Captain Macintosh
died in the flight.

233
00:27:46,749 --> 00:27:48,499
But, in fact, he missed it.

234
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:51,669
He did, however,
make the next flight

235
00:27:51,962 --> 00:27:53,254
in cargo

236
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:57,592
stuffed into a rather small
suitcase, considering his size.

237
00:27:58,594 --> 00:28:01,220
Someone on that flight
planned an operation

238
00:28:01,305 --> 00:28:03,723
designed to bring the plane down
and make it look like an accident.

239
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:06,934
Someone skillful enough to
bring it off without a hitch.

240
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:11,356
There's one thing we know
that Ambrose doesn't.

241
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,942
Then you do think it was Ambrose?
You're not surprised?

242
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:16,861
Sean feels he
hasn't done the job

243
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:18,863
unless he leaves a lot
of hats on the ground.

244
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:20,490
The question is why.

245
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:23,618
What was this Chimera
Nekhorvich was carrying?

246
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:26,537
Only Ambrose knows that.

247
00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:30,833
In any case, you must
recover this Chimera

248
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:32,627
and bring it to us.

249
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:37,298
In order to do that, I've got to figure
out how he plans to make money on it.

250
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:39,467
That is where Miss
Hall comes in.

251
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:45,473
Excuse me?

252
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,267
Miss Hall and Ambrose
had a relationship

253
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:49,602
which he took very seriously.

254
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:52,688
She walked away, and he's been
wanting her back ever since.

255
00:28:52,815 --> 00:28:55,983
We believe she's our surest and
quickest way of locating him.

256
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:57,568
And then what?

257
00:28:58,404 --> 00:29:00,488
Well, make sure she
continues to see him

258
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:03,533
gets him to confide in
her, and report to you.

259
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:21,008
You made it sound as if
I was recruiting her

260
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:23,094
for her skills as a thief.

261
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:27,306
Well, then I misled you or you
made the wrong assumption.

262
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:31,060
Either way, we are asking her
to resume a prior relationship

263
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,479
not do anything she
hasn't already done.

264
00:29:33,564 --> 00:29:35,523
Voluntarily, I might add.

265
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:41,362
No, she's got no training
for this kind of thing.

266
00:29:41,864 --> 00:29:43,364
To go to bed with a
man and lie to him?

267
00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:46,367
She's a woman. She's got all
the training she needs.

268
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:54,917
I don't think I can
get her to do it.

269
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:57,086
- You mean it'll be difficult.
- Very.

270
00:29:57,212 --> 00:30:00,548
Well, this is not Mission: Difficult,
Mr Hunt. It's Mission: Impossible.

271
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,508
Difficult should be a
walk in the park for you.

272
00:30:02,593 --> 00:30:04,051
I'm open to suggestion.

273
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:06,053
If you can think of a quicker
way to get to Ambrose

274
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:07,346
you're welcome to try.

275
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:08,723
You might want to
take a look at these

276
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:12,310
if you have any further qualms
about getting her to do the job.

277
00:31:10,327 --> 00:31:13,996
How many people are capable
of something like that?

278
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,502
Sean Ambrose

279
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,128
for one.

280
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:28,970
Right.

281
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:42,316
This wasn't what I
had in mind, Nyah.

282
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:48,990
But it is what you'd
like me to do.

283
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:54,412
What?

284
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:57,373
Oh, let my conscience be my guide.
Is that it?

285
00:31:57,499 --> 00:31:58,541
Something like that.

286
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:01,252
I don't have a conscience.
I'm a bloody thief.

287
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:07,842
You're gonna try and
force me to do this?

288
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,969
Generally, I don't
favour coercing someone

289
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:13,514
not when there's a chance my life
could end up in their hands.

290
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,683
Is that the only reason?

291
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:18,352
- Can you think of a better one?
- Me? No.

292
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:21,063
I was hoping you might, thinking that
somewhere in the course of business

293
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:23,357
this got personal as
well as physical!

294
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:26,402
Okay. Would it make you feel any better
if I didn't want you to do this?

295
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:28,696
- Yeah, much.
- Then feel better!

296
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:09,362
Sean will never be anything
but suspicious if I pitch up

297
00:33:09,446 --> 00:33:11,739
saying, "Hey, honey, I'm home."

298
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:15,201
What wouldn't make
him suspicious?

299
00:33:15,285 --> 00:33:17,912
That I needed him
in some urgent way.

300
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:21,207
Destitute,

301
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:23,000
in serious trouble,

302
00:33:23,085 --> 00:33:26,003
the kind I couldn't
possibly sort out myself.

303
00:33:26,922 --> 00:33:28,756
Serious trouble, Nyah

304
00:33:29,758 --> 00:33:32,134
is something I can
always arrange.

305
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:39,392
This transponder chip is
completely untraceable.

306
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:43,604
It transmits your
location to a satellite

307
00:33:43,814 --> 00:33:46,524
which can be read by
only this computer.

308
00:33:47,109 --> 00:33:49,777
We can then track you
to within three feet

309
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:50,945
anywhere.

310
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:55,616
Since your arrest, I've
been sending news bulletins

311
00:33:55,701 --> 00:33:58,494
to every law enforcement
agency in the world.

312
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:00,287
I know Sean Ambrose

313
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:03,874
and I guarantee that
after that airline crash

314
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:06,627
he's monitoring
every one of them.

315
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:08,796
He knows you're there.

316
00:34:10,424 --> 00:34:12,967
And he has the means
to get you out.

317
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:24,687
I'm not gonna lose you.

318
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:24,872
Agent Hunt?

319
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:26,916
Good day, mate. I'm William
Baird, but Billy's okay.

320
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,460
Anything you need me to get,
move or watch, I'm your man.

321
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:31,212
I'll have a look around.

322
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:37,092
Shit.

323
00:35:37,219 --> 00:35:38,552
Yes, it is.

324
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:42,223
This ain't funny.

325
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:45,935
I just bought these
$800 Gucci shoes

326
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:48,938
and you got me in a
helicopter with this man?

327
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:25,808
Computer's up. We got her.

328
00:36:26,935 --> 00:36:29,562
Let's put in the coordinates
and get a visual.

329
00:36:56,298 --> 00:37:00,175
- Visuals aren't coming up.
- Satellite doesn't work as fast as I do.

330
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,511
Yeah, I heard about you, Luther.

331
00:37:02,596 --> 00:37:06,932
I wanna say it's an honour and a
pleasure to be working with you blokes.

332
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:13,480
Isn't there any way
we can speed this up?

333
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:17,026
With what? This is the only
computer that will do this.

334
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:17,211
Ethan, here we go.

335
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:31,475
Now there's a bloke who knows
how to give a proper welcome.

336
00:38:33,186 --> 00:38:36,605
Don't get me wrong, mate. You
were very friendly also.

337
00:38:38,191 --> 00:38:39,483
Is it him then?

338
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:41,443
- It's him, Billy.
- So we got him.

339
00:38:41,528 --> 00:38:43,362
We don't know what we've got.

340
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:45,531
'Cause we don't
know what he's got

341
00:38:45,615 --> 00:38:48,826
where he's got it or what
he's doing in Sydney with it.

342
00:38:56,209 --> 00:38:57,876
Not much luggage.

343
00:38:58,294 --> 00:39:00,170
I left in a bit of a hurry.

344
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:02,715
I'm incredibly grateful, Sean.

345
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:06,135
How in the world
did you find me?

346
00:39:07,971 --> 00:39:10,139
How I usually find you.

347
00:39:11,391 --> 00:39:12,725
Magic.

348
00:39:31,828 --> 00:39:33,162
No flies on her.

349
00:39:33,663 --> 00:39:37,374
No bugs either. No transmissions.
She's clean.

350
00:39:38,418 --> 00:39:39,877
All cats are.

351
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:49,261
Your room?

352
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:55,225
And my room?

353
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:13,911
She did it.

354
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:16,455
She's in the compound.

355
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:18,499
Yeah?

356
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:23,170
We've just rolled up a snowball
and tossed it into hell.

357
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:26,215
Now we'll see what
chance it has.

358
00:40:28,218 --> 00:40:29,551
Try it on.

359
00:40:33,473 --> 00:40:34,723
Go ahead.

360
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:44,858
I'm dying to see if I
remembered your size.

361
00:41:14,347 --> 00:41:17,266
You're not interested
in seeing how it looks?

362
00:41:18,268 --> 00:41:19,601
Oh, I am.

363
00:41:22,856 --> 00:41:24,022
Later.

364
00:41:47,797 --> 00:41:49,965
Every search for a hero

365
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:53,385
must begin with something
that every hero requires,

366
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:54,803
a villain.

367
00:41:55,388 --> 00:41:59,641
Therefore in a search for
our hero, Bellerophon

368
00:42:00,393 --> 00:42:02,603
we created a monster.

369
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:04,188
Chimera.

370
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:06,440
Nekhorvich was a
molecular biologist.

371
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:09,359
Why is he going on about
an old Greek myth?

372
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:12,779
Nekhorvich specialised in
recombining DNA molecules.

373
00:42:14,616 --> 00:42:15,991
In the myth.

374
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:19,453
Bellerophon was a prince
who killed the Chimera,

375
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:23,207
a monster with the
head of a lion

376
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:26,335
and the tail of a serpent

377
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:29,421
who plagued the ancient world.

378
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:33,967
I think Nekhorvich created
a monster virus in Chimera

379
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:36,762
and the antivirus to kill it

380
00:42:36,846 --> 00:42:38,639
in Bellerophon.

381
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:41,683
That simple, huh?

382
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,270
Why not?

383
00:43:03,665 --> 00:43:05,832
Thirty-seven million pounds.

384
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:10,003
Well, that's a promising
bid for Nekhorvich's work.

385
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:15,676
Don't look so worried, Hugh.
We're halfway there.

386
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:21,223
We'll need this at the track

387
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:25,185
if we're going to
get the other half.

388
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:35,946
Well, then...

389
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:38,949
Sorted.

390
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,040
Not everything.

391
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,628
Why do you think
she's really here?

392
00:43:54,132 --> 00:43:56,216
From her point of view or mine?

393
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:58,677
She wasn't exactly
gagging for it

394
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:01,221
when she left you
six months ago.

395
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,643
The question is, "Do
you trust her?"

396
00:44:14,986 --> 00:44:17,279
One considers her
timing, of course.

397
00:44:17,405 --> 00:44:20,407
Getting nicked within a week
of the plane going down.

398
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:21,825
Suggestive

399
00:44:22,744 --> 00:44:24,745
even borderline suspicious

400
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:27,748
but hardly conclusive.

401
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:36,423
You've thought about
it at any rate.

402
00:44:41,429 --> 00:44:42,929
Tell me, Hugh.

403
00:44:43,765 --> 00:44:47,976
You don't exactly hang on Nyah's
every word and gesture, do you?

404
00:44:51,606 --> 00:44:53,607
That's a fairly ratty nail.

405
00:44:59,238 --> 00:45:00,405
Don't, please.

406
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:04,576
Suppose she is some sort of
Trojan horse sent in by IMF

407
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:05,952
to spy on us?

408
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:09,790
Why should I deny myself the
pleasure of a ride or two?

409
00:45:11,459 --> 00:45:14,878
Or don't you think I can learn more
from her than she can from me?

410
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:17,964
I do! I do! I do!

411
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:22,761
Now, Hugh, you must realise

412
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:26,473
that some of us have the
burden of sex to deal with.

413
00:45:26,766 --> 00:45:29,935
And I may or may not know
why she thinks she's here

414
00:45:30,103 --> 00:45:32,062
but I'm willing to take the risk

415
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:33,814
because, Hugh

416
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:37,984
I am gagging for it.

417
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:04,010
Come on! Come on!

418
00:46:05,805 --> 00:46:08,640
Darling, you won!

419
00:46:08,808 --> 00:46:10,350
I suppose I did.

420
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:12,394
What made you pick that nag?

421
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,479
She's never won a bloody thing.

422
00:46:14,564 --> 00:46:16,148
"Thief in the Night."

423
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:18,525
Say no more.

424
00:46:21,529 --> 00:46:23,363
I'm off to grab a drink.

425
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:25,657
You still favour the Bellinis?

426
00:46:42,884 --> 00:46:44,384
Naturally Vain.

427
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:47,554
Pardon me?

428
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,222
Naturally Vain?

429
00:46:50,725 --> 00:46:54,060
In the fourth. Check her out.
She's due.

430
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:10,744
You can speak as if I'm
right by your side.

431
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:12,996
Where are you?

432
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:15,749
Mounting enclosure, just
off the track, 2:00.

433
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:32,599
How's it going?

434
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:35,352
Just like old times.

435
00:47:37,063 --> 00:47:38,855
Just like old times?

436
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:41,191
Just about.

437
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:46,863
Tell me who you've run
into at Ambrose's.

438
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:51,701
Near as I can tell, there's about a
half dozen blokes about the place.

439
00:47:51,786 --> 00:47:53,036
Maybe more.

440
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,121
Hugh Stamp. Old
friend of Sean's.

441
00:47:55,248 --> 00:47:57,290
He's the only one I recognise.

442
00:47:57,375 --> 00:47:59,209
A creep and then some.

443
00:47:59,377 --> 00:48:03,046
We know him. He's over your left
shoulder looking at you right now.

444
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:08,677
Ambrose has photos of newspapers
with money piled on them.

445
00:48:08,803 --> 00:48:11,096
Thirty-seven million
on the London Times.

446
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:12,847
What's that about?

447
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:16,893
Bids from possible
Chimera buyers.

448
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:30,532
Ambrose is meeting
some bloke in the bar.

449
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:34,286
Big bloke. Ginger hair.
They're into something.

450
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:43,545
- Who is this guy?
- Checking now, Ethan.

451
00:48:50,845 --> 00:48:54,264
John McCloy, CEO Biocyte
Pharmaceuticals,

452
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:57,350
1989, acquired Biocyte
in a hostile takeover.

453
00:48:59,979 --> 00:49:02,105
- He was Nekhorvich's boss.
- Right.

454
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:05,233
He worked for him as the
research scientist at Biocyte.

455
00:49:06,569 --> 00:49:09,904
Ambrose is showing something
to McCloy on a digital camera.

456
00:49:10,573 --> 00:49:14,034
Whatever McCloy's looking at,
he's not happy about it.

457
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:26,963
Ambrose just pulled the
camera's memory card

458
00:49:27,048 --> 00:49:28,882
and put it into an envelope.

459
00:49:30,843 --> 00:49:33,053
Put it in his inner
left jacket pocket.

460
00:49:33,137 --> 00:49:35,221
Confirm left jacket pocket.

461
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:37,932
Roger that.

462
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:41,895
Nyah,

463
00:49:42,605 --> 00:49:44,522
Ambrose is on his
way back to you.

464
00:49:44,607 --> 00:49:47,901
- There's an envelope inside...
- His left jacket pocket.

465
00:49:48,611 --> 00:49:49,903
That's right.

466
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:51,237
Where do I meet you?

467
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:53,615
Betting table 12,
off the paddock.

468
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:57,118
- Are you sure you're up to this?
- I'll muddle through.

469
00:49:58,454 --> 00:50:00,955
- There you are.
- See anything you like?

470
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,957
Well, yeah.

471
00:50:03,042 --> 00:50:04,709
Naturally Vain.

472
00:50:04,794 --> 00:50:06,294
But they're about to
close the betting

473
00:50:06,379 --> 00:50:08,421
- and I haven't a bean.
- Nyah!

474
00:50:08,756 --> 00:50:11,383
- Would you mind terribly?
- Not at all.

475
00:50:11,467 --> 00:50:14,135
But you are gonna pay for it

476
00:50:14,679 --> 00:50:16,346
and with interest.

477
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:18,598
I have no doubt.

478
00:50:19,767 --> 00:50:21,184
Hold on.

479
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:37,117
Put down a thousand for me.

480
00:50:41,497 --> 00:50:43,707
- To win?
- What else?

481
00:50:47,211 --> 00:50:49,045
Billy, make sure
Nyah's not followed.

482
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:50,797
No worries, mate.

483
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:53,717
Luther, digital camera,
ready to transmit.

484
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:55,260
Betting table 12.

485
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:12,318
- There you go.
- Thanks.

486
00:51:14,822 --> 00:51:17,198
Sorry about that, mate.
That must have...

487
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:19,701
Say again?

488
00:51:20,828 --> 00:51:23,955
Whatever you're about, in
future watch your step.

489
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:26,750
Never know who you
might run into.

490
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:30,003
Where's the loo?

491
00:51:31,547 --> 00:51:32,839
Thanks, mate.

492
00:51:56,739 --> 00:51:58,198
How'd you do?

493
00:51:58,699 --> 00:52:00,366
Don't turn around.

494
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:02,702
I managed.

495
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:10,627
You turned around.

496
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:13,755
What are you gonna do, spank me?

497
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:41,574
I'm booted up. Go, Ethan.

498
00:52:48,707 --> 00:52:50,250
Are you getting this?

499
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:03,596
"Sergei Gradski"

500
00:53:04,932 --> 00:53:07,100
"20 hours after exposure."

501
00:53:46,307 --> 00:53:47,432
God.

502
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:57,609
Stamp's out of the loo.

503
00:53:57,693 --> 00:54:00,695
He's coming out of the tunnel
heading your way, mate.

504
00:54:00,863 --> 00:54:03,364
- I want you out of Ambrose's place.
- What are you talking about?

505
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:05,783
What's happened?
What did you see?

506
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:12,248
Okay, he's coming up
behind you, Ethan.

507
00:54:12,333 --> 00:54:15,668
You've done your job. I
want you out of Australia.

508
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:18,296
- Thirty steps.
- How do you suggest I go about it?

509
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:20,089
- Twenty, nineteen...
- He's touched your heart,

510
00:54:20,174 --> 00:54:21,758
you're overwhelmed and
need to think it over.

511
00:54:21,842 --> 00:54:23,593
Fifteen, fourteen.

512
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:25,595
- Twelve, eleven.
- I want you out of there now.

513
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:27,263
Give me the earpiece.

514
00:54:27,348 --> 00:54:28,848
Nine, Ethan. Eight.

515
00:54:28,933 --> 00:54:32,435
If you don't get out of there, I'm
coming in and getting you out.

516
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:34,354
Get out of there.

517
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:38,691
You place your bet, ma'am?

518
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:42,362
Just.

519
00:54:45,491 --> 00:54:47,450
Horses are ready to race.

520
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:57,627
Come on!

521
00:54:57,711 --> 00:55:00,797
Come on! Your nag's making a
run for it on the outside.

522
00:55:03,884 --> 00:55:05,176
Come on!

523
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:12,141
You picked another winner!

524
00:55:18,983 --> 00:55:21,150
I thought you were
going to dinner.

525
00:55:22,236 --> 00:55:25,655
Hugh, take care of the
Nekhorvich memory card.

526
00:55:27,533 --> 00:55:28,908
Where is it?

527
00:55:29,410 --> 00:55:31,911
In the envelope in
my jacket pocket.

528
00:55:34,832 --> 00:55:37,417
My right jacket pocket.

529
00:55:40,004 --> 00:55:42,839
We at our state-of-the-art,
solar-powered Biocyte building

530
00:55:42,923 --> 00:55:45,842
recognise that eternal vigilance
is the price of health

531
00:55:45,926 --> 00:55:47,593
whether it's funding
the teaching centre

532
00:55:47,678 --> 00:55:49,178
at the Royal Prince
Edward Hospital,

533
00:55:49,263 --> 00:55:51,514
removing aerosol
products from the market

534
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:55,268
or braving the influenza quarantine
at Bruny Island late last month.

535
00:55:55,394 --> 00:55:56,769
At Biocyte,

536
00:55:56,854 --> 00:55:59,522
your life is our life's work.

537
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:03,860
We've got an opportunity here.

538
00:56:04,528 --> 00:56:06,529
I'm not going to miss it.

539
00:56:37,311 --> 00:56:39,103
George, take me home.

540
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:58,263
George.

541
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:15,056
What the hell?

542
00:57:18,185 --> 00:57:19,227
George!

543
00:57:27,069 --> 00:57:28,528
George. George!

544
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:37,662
Sean?

545
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:43,209
Sean.

546
00:58:22,082 --> 00:58:23,583
Shh. Shh. Shh.

547
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:27,044
Easy.

548
00:58:28,255 --> 00:58:29,589
Oh, Ethan.

549
00:58:29,756 --> 00:58:31,257
Are you okay?

550
00:58:31,592 --> 00:58:33,176
Yeah, I am now.

551
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:21,682
What is this?

552
00:59:22,226 --> 00:59:24,227
A visit from an old friend.

553
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:28,898
You crashed on the plane.
You're dead.

554
00:59:29,358 --> 00:59:30,983
Tired, certainly.

555
00:59:31,068 --> 00:59:33,569
But dead is a little extreme.

556
00:59:35,113 --> 00:59:36,322
On the other hand

557
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:40,409
when my colleague Gradski had your
pulse and your blood pressure

558
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:43,913
he had less than a day to live.

559
00:59:48,210 --> 00:59:50,878
You're infected with
Chimera, my friend.

560
00:59:54,258 --> 00:59:56,008
No use, my friend.

561
00:59:56,969 --> 00:59:58,427
The medical staff

562
00:59:58,512 --> 01:00:00,263
wants no part of this.

563
01:00:00,764 --> 01:00:04,308
Doctors don't fancy the idea of
dying any more than anybody else.

564
01:00:04,810 --> 01:00:06,602
How could I possibly
be infected?

565
01:00:06,687 --> 01:00:11,232
That's exactly what Gradski
said 27 hours before he died.

566
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:15,236
You've got the antidote,
you miserable bastard!

567
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:17,822
- You stole Bellerophon. All of it!
- My, my, my.

568
01:00:17,906 --> 01:00:18,948
I need it.

569
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:21,701
I need it now, you
whacked-out Russian gypsy!

570
01:00:21,785 --> 01:00:26,580
And what about Gradski, who you
deliberately infected with Chimera?

571
01:00:26,707 --> 01:00:31,043
How was I to know he needed treatment
with Bellerophon within 20 hours?

572
01:00:31,128 --> 01:00:32,586
By asking me.

573
01:00:32,671 --> 01:00:34,922
You still don't get it, do you?

574
01:00:35,215 --> 01:00:38,884
I needed to know just how bad the
disease was in the real world

575
01:00:38,969 --> 01:00:40,594
not just the lab.

576
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:44,098
You were genetically splicing
together strains of influenza

577
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:46,642
to create a cure for
all influenzas.

578
01:00:46,727 --> 01:00:50,438
But you were also creating a
disease so terrible in Chimera

579
01:00:50,981 --> 01:00:53,107
the cure would be priceless.

580
01:00:53,191 --> 01:00:56,235
I needed Chimera in order
to peddle Bellerophon.

581
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:59,071
It's not that difficult
to understand, is it?

582
01:00:59,448 --> 01:01:02,742
Look, I've got the virus,
you've got the cure.

583
01:01:02,826 --> 01:01:04,452
I need them both.

584
01:01:04,786 --> 01:01:08,998
Time was, a shot of penicillin would
knock off every bug in the zoo.

585
01:01:09,124 --> 01:01:10,541
Not any more.

586
01:01:11,251 --> 01:01:15,129
If I couldn't make money killing the
microscopic little shits out there

587
01:01:15,422 --> 01:01:18,924
you'd help me put one out there
that I could make money on.

588
01:01:19,009 --> 01:01:22,178
Well, there it is.
I've confessed.

589
01:01:23,013 --> 01:01:25,514
L, John C. McCloy

590
01:01:25,766 --> 01:01:29,352
am in business to make money.

591
01:01:30,479 --> 01:01:34,440
Now forget any deal you may have
made with that thug Ambrose

592
01:01:34,858 --> 01:01:37,651
get me treated, and
let's go back to work.

593
01:01:38,278 --> 01:01:39,528
You know

594
01:01:40,447 --> 01:01:44,116
I think it's a little
late for that.

595
01:01:45,452 --> 01:01:47,661
Do give my regards to Gradski

596
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:50,373
if you see him.

597
01:02:01,301 --> 01:02:02,802
Well?

598
01:02:06,473 --> 01:02:08,140
I've heard

599
01:02:11,895 --> 01:02:13,646
all I need to hear.

600
01:02:16,650 --> 01:02:17,858
Nyah.

601
01:02:19,694 --> 01:02:24,657
It's imperative that we do
nothing to alarm Ambrose.

602
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:26,659
What?

603
01:02:28,036 --> 01:02:29,662
You told me to leave
as soon as I could.

604
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:31,539
I thought you were
here to collect me!

605
01:02:34,251 --> 01:02:36,710
Listen to me. There's
no time to talk.

606
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:39,547
It is critical,

607
01:02:39,673 --> 01:02:42,258
absolutely critical

608
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:46,345
that you do whatever
Ambrose asks.

609
01:02:49,724 --> 01:02:51,684
Do you understand me?

610
01:02:54,896 --> 01:02:56,188
Don't worry.

611
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:00,192
It will all be over

612
01:03:00,902 --> 01:03:02,236
very soon.

613
01:03:09,995 --> 01:03:11,412
That's a promise.

614
01:03:12,706 --> 01:03:14,039
Come on.

615
01:03:17,377 --> 01:03:18,502
Off you go.

616
01:03:49,868 --> 01:03:51,410
Luther, we know this much.

617
01:03:51,536 --> 01:03:55,247
Nekhorvich gets on a plane to go to the
Centre for Disease Control in Atlanta.

618
01:03:55,415 --> 01:03:58,125
He's carrying a virus
he created, Chimera,

619
01:03:58,585 --> 01:04:01,587
and the cure for that
virus, Bellerophon.

620
01:04:05,091 --> 01:04:06,800
Ambrose doesn't have the virus.

621
01:04:06,968 --> 01:04:09,220
That's why Ambrose needs McCloy.

622
01:04:10,805 --> 01:04:13,766
So we go into Biocyte,
kill Chimera.

623
01:04:15,143 --> 01:04:19,230
Ambrose has a cure without a
disease and we're home free.

624
01:04:20,607 --> 01:04:21,941
You were right.

625
01:04:22,025 --> 01:04:24,401
Hunt stung McCloy tonight.

626
01:04:25,445 --> 01:04:27,071
So he knows.

627
01:04:27,572 --> 01:04:29,698
He'll be going into Biocyte.

628
01:04:31,409 --> 01:04:32,576
Good.

629
01:04:33,411 --> 01:04:35,913
Then we know where
he'll be, don't we?

630
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:39,750
Well done, Hugh.

631
01:04:41,753 --> 01:04:43,128
Well done.

632
01:04:55,475 --> 01:04:57,601
You're home, mate. Home.

633
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:04,817
Where's George, my regular driver?
Where is he?

634
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:07,361
He's gone home sick.
Touch of the flu.

635
01:05:10,490 --> 01:05:11,991
The building up and running yet?

636
01:05:16,788 --> 01:05:20,499
- That's not exactly it.
- Sorry, but this is a Biocyte facility.

637
01:05:20,584 --> 01:05:22,251
Their storage structure.

638
01:05:22,335 --> 01:05:23,752
I'll have it up in a minute.

639
01:05:26,089 --> 01:05:28,340
Okay, take a look at this.

640
01:05:28,633 --> 01:05:29,925
Let's start from the inside out.

641
01:05:30,010 --> 01:05:33,095
All storage and production
of Chimera is done here

642
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:35,598
in this lab on the 42nd floor.

643
01:05:36,349 --> 01:05:38,767
Hunt's target will
be the Chimera

644
01:05:38,852 --> 01:05:42,855
stored and manufactured at
Biocyte on the 42nd floor.

645
01:05:44,274 --> 01:05:48,402
If you look at Hunt's operational
history, and I have,

646
01:05:48,737 --> 01:05:52,448
he invariably favours
misdirection over confrontation.

647
01:05:53,283 --> 01:05:55,492
He'll never break into
Biocyte from the bottom,

648
01:05:55,577 --> 01:05:57,286
where security is heaviest.

649
01:05:57,954 --> 01:05:59,622
No garage entrances.

650
01:05:59,789 --> 01:06:03,083
Lobby's protected by five
guards on rotating patrol.

651
01:06:04,836 --> 01:06:08,130
Not going in from the ground.
Show me the atrium.

652
01:06:09,132 --> 01:06:11,925
The atrium? One of a kind.

653
01:06:12,385 --> 01:06:14,511
Runs down through the
centre of the building.

654
01:06:14,596 --> 01:06:18,724
Provides 24-hour natural light via
mirrors and daylight storage cells,

655
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:21,185
optimum growing
conditions for the virus.

656
01:06:21,269 --> 01:06:24,980
Ends in a glass floor which doubles
as part of the lab ceiling.

657
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:29,610
Uh-uh.

658
01:06:29,861 --> 01:06:32,279
The atrium roof
closes at sundown.

659
01:06:32,447 --> 01:06:35,616
And if the louvers are up for
more than 40 seconds at night,

660
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:39,453
the civil emergency alarms are tripped.
Those even I can't stop.

661
01:06:40,497 --> 01:06:44,625
We have a total of 40 seconds to
get you in and the cables out.

662
01:06:47,253 --> 01:06:52,174
Hunt will prefer to enter Biocyte from
the top, where security is minimal.

663
01:06:52,592 --> 01:06:56,136
He'll undoubtedly engage
in some aerobatic insanity

664
01:06:56,221 --> 01:06:59,431
before he'll risk harming a hair
on a security guard's head.

665
01:07:14,072 --> 01:07:16,615
- Check, check. Copy?
- You're five-by-five.

666
01:07:20,995 --> 01:07:22,830
Luther, how we doing?

667
01:07:23,164 --> 01:07:25,416
Not there yet, Ethan.
I'll give you the word.

668
01:07:28,712 --> 01:07:30,671
Billy, ready to go?

669
01:07:35,593 --> 01:07:38,512
- Package away in five.
- Not yet. The louvers aren't moving.

670
01:07:38,972 --> 01:07:40,305
Luther, we gotta go.

671
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:42,516
Wait. There's a glitch
in the access code.

672
01:07:52,402 --> 01:07:55,320
Luther, we're out of time.
On the count.

673
01:07:55,405 --> 01:07:58,365
Please, baby, open up. Open up.

674
01:07:58,450 --> 01:08:00,743
Five, four...

675
01:08:00,952 --> 01:08:03,829
- Come on!
- ...three, two, one!

676
01:08:03,913 --> 01:08:06,373
- I'm going now!
- Ethan, wait!

677
01:08:42,577 --> 01:08:45,954
25, 24, 23,

678
01:08:46,581 --> 01:08:50,042
22, 21, 20.

679
01:08:51,377 --> 01:08:54,213
You've got 19 seconds
to clear the cable.

680
01:09:02,222 --> 01:09:04,223
Okay, retracting cable.

681
01:09:09,395 --> 01:09:10,729
Come on.

682
01:09:11,648 --> 01:09:15,901
Nine, eight, seven, six, five,

683
01:09:16,236 --> 01:09:19,071
four, three, two...

684
01:09:20,907 --> 01:09:22,658
Cable's clear!

685
01:09:36,422 --> 01:09:38,048
Transponder activated.

686
01:09:38,132 --> 01:09:40,425
Reading package and cable clear.

687
01:09:49,102 --> 01:09:51,395
He'll breach the lab at
the only possible time.

688
01:09:51,479 --> 01:09:53,814
Whether you break in from
the ground or the roof,

689
01:09:54,274 --> 01:09:57,234
it's 23:00 hours, one minute

690
01:09:57,318 --> 01:10:00,821
when the air filtration generators will
cover the sound of Hunt's break-in

691
01:10:00,947 --> 01:10:05,117
and rotating guards make the building
vulnerable to our break-in from below.

692
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:09,913
Ethan, the generators
are about to go active.

693
01:10:09,998 --> 01:10:12,916
Just a friendly reminder, we'll be
out of contact for eight minutes.

694
01:10:45,658 --> 01:10:48,410
I'm betting Hunt
will destroy Chimera

695
01:10:48,494 --> 01:10:51,330
rather than attempt to
preserve any part of it.

696
01:10:51,873 --> 01:10:54,041
He'll have to do
it in two places.

697
01:10:54,834 --> 01:10:56,001
First,

698
01:10:56,878 --> 01:10:59,796
the incubation room where
the growth vials are kept.

699
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:05,093
And finally, in the
inoculation chamber

700
01:11:05,178 --> 01:11:09,014
holding the last remaining Chimera
virus and three injection guns.

701
01:11:11,309 --> 01:11:14,811
He won't be allowed to destroy
the virus in those guns.

702
01:11:30,662 --> 01:11:32,996
What's this? You're
on time for once?

703
01:11:33,206 --> 01:11:34,873
Not exactly, sport.

704
01:11:42,215 --> 01:11:44,049
John C. McCloy.

705
01:12:05,238 --> 01:12:07,030
Billy, we've got a problem.

706
01:12:07,198 --> 01:12:10,659
Nyah's on the wing up early.
Billy, do you copy?

707
01:12:10,743 --> 01:12:13,996
Yeah, I got you, Luther.
Exactly where is she?

708
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:16,540
- In the building.
- Say again, mate.

709
01:12:17,208 --> 01:12:19,167
Sounds like you said
she's in the building.

710
01:12:19,252 --> 01:12:20,669
I am. She is.

711
01:12:22,338 --> 01:12:25,716
Well, then, she's not
likely to be alone, is she?

712
01:12:26,009 --> 01:12:28,510
She's in the elevator
headed towards Ethan.

713
01:12:28,594 --> 01:12:30,262
The question is,
how many of them?

714
01:12:30,388 --> 01:12:33,181
I can't get through to Ethan
till the generators go off.

715
01:12:33,266 --> 01:12:34,349
When's that?

716
01:12:34,434 --> 01:12:37,269
Not for another
five-and-a-half minutes.

717
01:13:13,264 --> 01:13:15,307
Chimera in vitro pH

718
01:13:15,433 --> 01:13:18,894
and temperature level
outside optimal range.

719
01:13:19,562 --> 01:13:21,480
Chimera in vitro pH

720
01:13:21,564 --> 01:13:25,233
and temperature level
outside optimal range.

721
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:29,654
Chimera working seed stock
pH at critical level.

722
01:13:29,989 --> 01:13:33,658
Alert. Chimera stock
life threatened.

723
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:37,746
Alert. Chimera stock
life terminated.

724
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:45,670
Come on, Ethan. Come on.

725
01:14:02,647 --> 01:14:06,608
Subject is contaminant-free.
Zero contaminant factor.

726
01:14:18,746 --> 01:14:20,622
Come on, come on.

727
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:23,834
Luther, what the hell can we do?

728
01:14:24,293 --> 01:14:25,627
What can we do?

729
01:14:26,504 --> 01:14:30,173
Hope he kills all the bugs before
the yellow dot gets to the red one.

730
01:15:22,018 --> 01:15:23,393
However we travel,

731
01:15:23,477 --> 01:15:27,564
I must arrive at my destination
within 20 hours of departure.

732
01:15:32,945 --> 01:15:37,199
How was I to know he needed treatment
with Bellerophon within 20 hours?

733
01:16:01,349 --> 01:16:02,515
Get him.

734
01:16:25,498 --> 01:16:27,332
How much longer before
you can reach him?

735
01:16:27,416 --> 01:16:30,543
We got 29 seconds before
the generators turn off.

736
01:16:30,628 --> 01:16:32,671
Then Ethan'll be back on line.

737
01:17:19,218 --> 01:17:20,552
Luther!

738
01:17:53,419 --> 01:17:55,503
Hold your fire!

739
01:17:55,588 --> 01:17:57,672
Hold your fire, damn it!

740
01:18:12,271 --> 01:18:13,813
Well, Hunt,

741
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:17,442
how you been?

742
01:18:21,030 --> 01:18:22,572
Fighting a bit of a cold.

743
01:18:27,995 --> 01:18:30,747
That was the hardest part
of having to portray you,

744
01:18:30,956 --> 01:18:33,875
grinning like an idiot
every 15 minutes.

745
01:18:35,336 --> 01:18:38,296
I always thought the hardest part was
kerbing that pressing need of yours

746
01:18:38,381 --> 01:18:39,839
to get your gun off.

747
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:43,635
You were in such a hurry
to knock off that 747,

748
01:18:43,719 --> 01:18:45,804
you never figured out
where Chimera really was.

749
01:18:46,180 --> 01:18:48,431
- I knew where it was.
- Oh.

750
01:18:49,058 --> 01:18:52,143
Then you knew the only way Nekhorvich
could smuggle the live virus

751
01:18:52,228 --> 01:18:53,478
was by injecting himself,

752
01:18:53,562 --> 01:18:55,772
and using his own bloodstream
as a petri dish.

753
01:18:55,856 --> 01:18:57,315
You knew that

754
01:18:58,109 --> 01:19:01,736
while you were knocking him off,
destroying the very thing you came for.

755
01:19:08,327 --> 01:19:10,453
Stop!

756
01:19:10,538 --> 01:19:12,330
Put a sock in it!

757
01:19:14,708 --> 01:19:18,253
Hit that bloody gun, and you'll
spread that virus all over the place!

758
01:19:19,463 --> 01:19:21,297
There it is, guys.

759
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:24,843
The last of it.

760
01:19:25,970 --> 01:19:27,303
What was the top bid?

761
01:19:27,430 --> 01:19:29,931
Why? You gonna make
me a better offer?

762
01:19:30,433 --> 01:19:34,060
Than 37 million pounds?
Not really.

763
01:19:35,229 --> 01:19:36,312
Oh.

764
01:19:36,814 --> 01:19:40,942
Somebody has been
slipping you our mail.

765
01:19:41,777 --> 01:19:45,363
Come on out here, you bad girl.

766
01:19:58,836 --> 01:20:00,545
She doesn't belong here.

767
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:02,213
Let her go.

768
01:20:02,590 --> 01:20:08,219
She wouldn't be here if
it wasn't for you, Hunt.

769
01:20:15,519 --> 01:20:20,023
From this moment, you are responsible
for what happens to her.

770
01:20:20,107 --> 01:20:22,692
And if you're looking
out for her well-being,

771
01:20:22,776 --> 01:20:27,739
I suggest you advise her to pick up
the injection gun and bring it to me.

772
01:20:29,575 --> 01:20:31,868
The ball's in your court, Hunt.

773
01:20:38,834 --> 01:20:40,627
Nyah's in the building.

774
01:20:41,170 --> 01:20:42,629
Do you copy?

775
01:20:43,589 --> 01:20:44,923
Thank you.

776
01:21:01,273 --> 01:21:04,025
How do you know he won't shoot
you the minute he's got it?

777
01:21:04,693 --> 01:21:07,278
One can't hold Nyah
responsible for her actions.

778
01:21:07,363 --> 01:21:08,863
You know women, mate.

779
01:21:09,490 --> 01:21:11,366
Like monkeys they are.

780
01:21:11,784 --> 01:21:14,953
Won't let go of one branch till
they get a grip on the next.

781
01:21:17,665 --> 01:21:20,625
Get it, Nyah. I'll cover you.

782
01:21:53,826 --> 01:21:56,035
I am waiting.

783
01:22:07,172 --> 01:22:10,675
Things haven't exactly worked out the
way you thought they would, Ethan.

784
01:22:12,595 --> 01:22:13,886
Sorry.

785
01:22:30,696 --> 01:22:32,530
You bitch!

786
01:22:48,464 --> 01:22:52,383
You're not gonna shoot me, Sean.
Not this bitch.

787
01:22:52,551 --> 01:22:56,304
'Cause she's worth
37 million pounds.

788
01:23:27,252 --> 01:23:30,797
- What did you think you were doing?
- I wasn't thinking!

789
01:23:31,173 --> 01:23:33,966
Just trying to stop you from
getting hurt, that's all.

790
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:36,969
You who don't have a conscience.

791
01:23:37,596 --> 01:23:39,263
I guess I lied.

792
01:24:06,667 --> 01:24:09,043
You can't get us both
out of here, can you?

793
01:24:22,641 --> 01:24:24,559
I'm infected with Chimera.

794
01:24:24,643 --> 01:24:27,645
You know you don't have a choice.
Just do it.

795
01:24:29,064 --> 01:24:30,815
Do it. Now!

796
01:24:51,336 --> 01:24:54,505
We've got 19 hours
and 58 minutes.

797
01:24:54,673 --> 01:24:57,842
I'll get Bellerophon into
your system before then.

798
01:25:00,679 --> 01:25:04,724
Just stay alive! I'm
not going to lose you!

799
01:26:15,087 --> 01:26:17,505
Feel like pleading
for your life?

800
01:26:22,928 --> 01:26:29,475
Well, then how about dying so
you can make me a lot of money.

801
01:26:35,691 --> 01:26:37,984
In just a few hours time

802
01:26:38,527 --> 01:26:42,947
you can be assured of going down in
history as the Typhoid Mary of Oz.

803
01:26:44,449 --> 01:26:45,783
Good day.

804
01:26:49,663 --> 01:26:52,915
There's not a chance of locating Nyah
until I can access the satellite.

805
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,710
I can't do that till I
get this computer fixed,

806
01:26:55,794 --> 01:26:57,211
and that's taking a while.

807
01:26:57,296 --> 01:26:59,881
- How much time does she have left?
- Not long.

808
01:27:00,382 --> 01:27:04,093
- But Nyah will take care of Nyah.
- What do you mean?

809
01:27:04,177 --> 01:27:07,138
Unless we dose her with Bellerophon,
Nyah will kill herself.

810
01:27:08,724 --> 01:27:10,308
So first things first.

811
01:28:06,615 --> 01:28:08,991
Ambrose and his team have
arrived over the bridge,

812
01:28:09,076 --> 01:28:10,326
and Nyah's not with him.

813
01:28:10,410 --> 01:28:11,452
Copy that.

814
01:28:19,211 --> 01:28:22,880
You all right, mate? Looks
like heavy security from here.

815
01:28:23,715 --> 01:28:25,383
What's it look like from there?

816
01:28:27,469 --> 01:28:28,719
Risky.

817
01:29:47,716 --> 01:29:48,966
Simon.

818
01:29:51,386 --> 01:29:52,636
Stay here.

819
01:30:09,404 --> 01:30:11,572
Breached the structure
at the 10:00 grating.

820
01:30:23,835 --> 01:30:27,713
It's a DNA match. The blood's
loaded with Chimera.

821
01:30:36,681 --> 01:30:39,350
And they certainly
have Bellerophon.

822
01:30:41,853 --> 01:30:46,398
You've got the virus and the antivirus,
which means I've got 30 million for you.

823
01:30:46,608 --> 01:30:50,319
Not exactly. We don't
want just your cash.

824
01:30:50,403 --> 01:30:54,365
- What do you want?
- Stock, Mr McCloy.

825
01:30:55,075 --> 01:30:58,369
Stock options to be a
little more precise.

826
01:31:06,044 --> 01:31:09,922
Cut her loose right in
the centre of town.

827
01:31:10,298 --> 01:31:12,049
The more crowded, the better.

828
01:31:14,469 --> 01:31:15,886
Just picked up an Ambrose call.

829
01:31:15,971 --> 01:31:17,471
Nyah's been dropped off.

830
01:31:17,556 --> 01:31:19,390
- I think she's still alive.
- Where is she?

831
01:31:19,933 --> 01:31:21,725
Somewhere in Sydney.

832
01:31:32,070 --> 01:31:34,780
Somewhere in Sydney? Care
to harden the target?

833
01:31:35,740 --> 01:31:39,243
I can't until I can get the GPS up
on our computer. It's still down.

834
01:31:41,329 --> 01:31:43,247
The clock is ticking.

835
01:31:44,082 --> 01:31:46,876
How quickly can you manufacture
more of the antivirus?

836
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:49,753
- No time at all, once I've got it.
- Good.

837
01:31:49,963 --> 01:31:53,048
Biocyte stock is just a few weeks
away from going through the roof.

838
01:31:53,133 --> 01:31:55,926
- What are you talking about?
- An outbreak of Chimera.

839
01:31:56,094 --> 01:31:59,763
- Where?
- Downtown Sydney, for a start.

840
01:31:59,931 --> 01:32:03,392
You create the supply, Mr McCloy.
We've just created the demand.

841
01:32:03,476 --> 01:32:07,563
Three million people in Sydney and
17 million people in Australia

842
01:32:07,647 --> 01:32:10,357
are going to need Bellerophon
within the next few days.

843
01:32:10,483 --> 01:32:12,276
Not to mention the
rest of the world.

844
01:32:12,819 --> 01:32:14,945
Now, this is how
it's going to work.

845
01:32:15,447 --> 01:32:18,073
- The shares outstanding are?
- 93.4 million.

846
01:32:18,158 --> 01:32:19,575
Which means, Mr McCloy,

847
01:32:19,659 --> 01:32:23,412
we need to get our hands
on 480,000 options.

848
01:32:23,496 --> 01:32:26,290
We'll borrow your 30 million
to buy those options.

849
01:32:26,374 --> 01:32:29,752
Your stock has never
sold above $31 a share.

850
01:32:29,836 --> 01:32:33,964
When your stock goes north
of 200, which it will,

851
01:32:34,049 --> 01:32:36,217
those options will
be worth billions,

852
01:32:36,384 --> 01:32:41,680
and I will own 51
percent of Biocyte.

853
01:32:41,890 --> 01:32:43,474
This is outrageous.

854
01:32:44,476 --> 01:32:47,811
I will not let you take
control of my company.

855
01:32:48,313 --> 01:32:50,356
Sit down.

856
01:33:30,188 --> 01:33:33,148
You'll be a billionaire. That's
better than being broke.

857
01:33:33,233 --> 01:33:36,151
I have terrorists and other
pharmaceutical companies

858
01:33:36,236 --> 01:33:37,528
standing in line.

859
01:33:43,743 --> 01:33:46,245
The ball's in your
court, Mr McCloy.

860
01:34:41,259 --> 01:34:44,094
Run that bastard down.

861
01:34:58,443 --> 01:35:01,403
We're running short
on time, Mr McCloy.

862
01:35:02,280 --> 01:35:04,823
We have got to
conclude our business.

863
01:35:06,743 --> 01:35:07,951
Yes.

864
01:35:08,828 --> 01:35:10,287
Start the transfer.

865
01:35:16,669 --> 01:35:19,505
Follow it and let me know.

866
01:36:28,867 --> 01:36:31,243
Raise your hands very slowly.

867
01:36:31,870 --> 01:36:33,996
Sure you want me to do this?

868
01:36:34,914 --> 01:36:38,041
Raise your hands very slowly.

869
01:37:11,576 --> 01:37:13,243
Ethan. Ethan, do you copy?

870
01:37:19,751 --> 01:37:22,419
Keep it going.

871
01:37:29,594 --> 01:37:33,388
Sean, this rat's reached
the end of the maze.

872
01:37:34,432 --> 01:37:35,974
Is he alive?

873
01:37:36,434 --> 01:37:38,769
Yeah, more or less.

874
01:37:40,772 --> 01:37:42,856
Bring him to me.

875
01:37:43,274 --> 01:37:44,316
Go.

876
01:37:51,407 --> 01:37:54,201
Sean, transfer completed.

877
01:38:15,223 --> 01:38:18,225
Well done, Stamp. Well done.

878
01:38:37,412 --> 01:38:39,454
Stop mumbling!

879
01:38:39,539 --> 01:38:44,167
I'm afraid he's got no choice.
I believe I broke his jaw.

880
01:38:45,169 --> 01:38:48,171
Stamp, I'm impressed.

881
01:38:49,424 --> 01:38:50,924
We don't have a lot
of time, Hunt.

882
01:38:51,009 --> 01:38:53,802
Whatever you've got
to say, say it now.

883
01:38:55,555 --> 01:38:58,390
How about giving us a big smile?

884
01:39:01,060 --> 01:39:02,144
No?

885
01:39:02,228 --> 01:39:03,645
What are you doing?

886
01:39:05,106 --> 01:39:08,775
Get down on your knees.

887
01:39:11,362 --> 01:39:15,574
Now, this is what's known

888
01:39:15,867 --> 01:39:18,160
as getting your gun off.

889
01:40:28,940 --> 01:40:30,399
There he is!

890
01:40:41,035 --> 01:40:42,369
Ethan!

891
01:40:58,010 --> 01:41:00,971
Just back off and
pinpoint their positions!

892
01:41:59,197 --> 01:42:01,615
Luther, clear the bridge for me.

893
01:42:05,745 --> 01:42:09,080
Hunt's heading for the bridge,
coming in at 12:00 high.

894
01:42:25,723 --> 01:42:27,390
Oh, I'm mad now.

895
01:43:38,129 --> 01:43:41,464
- You all right, mate?
- That punk put a hole in my Versace.

896
01:44:45,363 --> 01:44:47,656
Ethan, the computer's up.
I've got Nyah.

897
01:44:47,740 --> 01:44:49,366
She's moved out of the city.

898
01:44:49,450 --> 01:44:51,701
She's on the north bluff
approaching the cliffs,

899
01:44:51,786 --> 01:44:53,370
but I can't get a visual.

900
01:44:53,454 --> 01:44:56,581
Copy! She's only got
a little time left!

901
01:44:56,666 --> 01:44:59,292
Track ahead and pick her up!

902
01:45:06,050 --> 01:45:07,634
I can't get a good shot!

903
01:45:07,718 --> 01:45:09,552
Ethan, we won't be
able to cover you.

904
01:45:10,513 --> 01:45:14,224
My earpiece is failing.
You've got me on GPS.

905
01:45:14,308 --> 01:45:16,226
Bring her to me.

906
01:45:24,652 --> 01:45:27,112
Billy, north head bluff.
Haul ass.

907
01:45:54,015 --> 01:45:57,392
- Get out there and keep firing!
- I can't see anything!

908
01:45:57,518 --> 01:46:00,145
Slow down, mate, slow down!

909
01:48:00,432 --> 01:48:02,225
Range is 2 "K."

910
01:51:35,939 --> 01:51:38,441
Go ahead. Use it, Hunt.

911
01:51:39,318 --> 01:51:41,110
It's not a bad way to go.

912
01:51:42,029 --> 01:51:45,114
It's a lot better than the
way that bitch is gonna die.

913
01:52:32,746 --> 01:52:34,163
There she is!

914
01:54:39,248 --> 01:54:40,456
Hunt!

915
01:54:44,211 --> 01:54:47,588
You should've killed me.

916
01:56:27,272 --> 01:56:31,150
Miss Hall's blood has absolutely
no elements of the Chimera virus,

917
01:56:31,234 --> 01:56:32,902
not even antibodies.

918
01:56:34,738 --> 01:56:36,656
Yes, I gathered as much.

919
01:56:36,740 --> 01:56:42,411
But you were under specific instructions
to retrieve a live sample of the virus.

920
01:56:42,996 --> 01:56:46,165
I'd be very interested to know how,
after you'd managed this recovery,

921
01:56:46,249 --> 01:56:48,417
it subsequently got destroyed.

922
01:56:49,586 --> 01:56:50,920
By fire.

923
01:56:51,505 --> 01:56:53,798
- It's the best way, really.
- Oh.

924
01:56:55,467 --> 01:56:59,679
Well, as for Miss Hall,
in light of her efforts

925
01:57:01,139 --> 01:57:04,266
her criminal record will
certainly be expunged.

926
01:57:04,351 --> 01:57:05,559
Wiped out.

927
01:57:05,936 --> 01:57:07,937
I'm assuming you approve.

928
01:57:11,191 --> 01:57:12,358
I do.

929
01:57:13,944 --> 01:57:15,736
Where is she now? Any idea?

930
01:57:17,114 --> 01:57:19,448
I don't know. Not exactly.

931
01:57:20,909 --> 01:57:23,452
- So what are your plans?
- I don't know.

932
01:57:24,955 --> 01:57:28,624
Some sort of vacation. I'll
let you know where I'm going.

933
01:57:29,835 --> 01:57:31,293
Don't have to do that.

934
01:57:32,629 --> 01:57:34,630
It wouldn't be a
vacation if you did.

935
01:58:25,348 --> 01:58:27,224
Let's get lost.

936
01:58:28,305 --> 01:59:28,281
