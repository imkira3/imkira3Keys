00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:36,900
<i>There was a time when the fearsome,
beautiful land of Alagaësia...</i>

3
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:41,900
<i>...was ruled by men astride mighty dragons.</i>

4
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,900
<i>To protect and serve was their mission.</i>

5
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,700
<i>And for thousands of years,
the people prospered.</i>

6
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,200
<i>But the riders grew arrogant...</i>

7
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,900
<i>...and began to fight among themselves
for power.</i>

8
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,100
<i>Sensing their weakness...</i>

9
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:07,100
<i>...a young rider named Galbatorix
betrayed them...</i>

10
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,800
<i>...and in a single bloody battle,
believed he had killed them all...</i>

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,900
<i>...riders and dragons alike.</i>

12
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:27,200
<i>Since then, our land
has been ruled by Galbatorix.</i>

13
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,700
<i>He crushed all rebellion...</i>

14
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:33,900
<i>...including the freedom fighters
known as the Varden.</i>

15
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:39,700
<i>Those that survived fled to the mountains.</i>

16
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,600
<i>There they hoped for a miracle...</i>

17
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,500
<i>...that might even their odds
against the king.</i>

18
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,300
<i>Our story begins one night...</i>

19
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:01,300
<i>...as Arya, an ally of the Varden,
rides for her life...</i>

20
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:06,900
<i>...carrying a stone
stolen from the king himself.</i>

21
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,500
I suffer without my stone.

22
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,100
Do not prolong my suffering.

23
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,700
<i>Miles away,
a young boy ventures out hunting.</i>

24
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,900
<i>His life and Alagaësia...</i>

25
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,200
<i>...will never be the same again.</i>

26
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,800
- Give it to me...
- Durza.

27
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,600
...and I'll let you live.

28
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,700
Is there anyone
who trusts the word of a Shade?

29
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,200
Where did you send it?

30
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,500
Poor Durza.

31
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,800
How will you tell the king you failed?

32
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,400
Come with me.

33
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,100
Two more patriotic volunteers
for the king's army.

34
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:39,400
My sons are not fighters.
The men you take, they never return.

35
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,300
Every village must do its share.

36
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,800
Rejoice. Your sons will be heroes.

37
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,000
Expensive taste, Eragon.

38
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:07,200
The king's strip. The best cut there is.
The fat just melts into the meat.

39
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,400
How much?

40
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,600
How much?

41
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,600
Too much for a poor farm boy.

42
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,600
I have something. Something to trade.

43
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,600
What is this? Some kind of stone?

44
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,500
- I found it.
- Stole it, more likely.

45
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,600
I was hunting.

46
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,200
Hunting in the Spine.

47
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,900
Put it back. It belongs to the king.
Tell no one you have it.

48
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,600
You'll endanger the whole village.
Now get out.

49
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,500
I don't need that sort of trouble here.
Get out.

50
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,100
Look at this. A necklace.

51
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:05,300
Now, where'd a fool like you
find such an appetizing string of jewels?

52
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,700
- Interesting you should ask.
- Is that right?

53
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:14,300
I was walking up the lane the other day,
admiring them sitting on a branch.

54
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,400
Clap of thunder,
they fell dead at me feet.

55
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,100
So I thought,
"Well, I can't leave them there.

56
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,700
Someone might trip."

57
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:26,100
- So I hung them up there, out of the way.
- Do you know what I think?

58
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,300
- What's that?
- I think you're a thief.

59
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,500
- A poacher.
- Oh, no.

60
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,200
I confiscate them all
in the name of the king.

61
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,400
Don't try anything.

62
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,900
Well, I'll just cut them down
for you then, shall I?

63
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,300
- Grab those.
- Sorry I didn't pluck them.

64
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,900
Take care of the little bones.

65
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,600
Hate to see you choke.

66
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:06,100
All hail Eragon.
The mighty hunter returns.

67
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,300
Yeah. With his invisible catch.

68
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:16,200
What happened, did you get scared
when the deer growled?

69
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,100
No respect for the hunter?

70
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,200
Don't you ever learn?

71
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,300
Shall we have another lesson today?

72
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,000
You fight like an old goat, Roran.

73
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,500
Mind my breakfast.

74
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,000
- You're too slow, Roran.
- Wake up, dreamer.

75
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,000
That sounded like your head.

76
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:08,700
Hey. Come on, boys. That's enough.
Come on, Roran.

77
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,800
Eragon?

78
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,800
I'm leaving.

79
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,500
I'm old enough to be recruited now.

80
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,400
Before the soldiers come looking for me.

81
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,900
I won't serve in the army.

82
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,700
I'll send word when I've settled.

83
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,800
- But what--?
- He knows.

84
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,900
I already told him.

85
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,500
Where will you go?

86
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,600
I don't know yet.

87
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,400
All I know is I'm going.

88
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,300
Roran? Eragon?

89
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,200
Come on.

90
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,400
Roran told you then?

91
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,900
Your day will come too, Eragon.

92
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:45,400
And you will decide for yourself
the kind of life you wish to lead.

93
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,600
Uncle, I like my life right here.

94
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,100
What many men seek
is often right under their nose.

95
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:00,100
But for some,
the unknown is too hard to resist.

96
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,300
Is that why my mother left?

97
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,800
My sister was in a great hurry
when she left you here.

98
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,700
Whatever her reasons, we can only trust
they were for your own good.

99
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:22,000
Besides, had she not,
I wouldn't have gained another son.

100
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,100
Take these.

101
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,100
I've been saving them for you.

102
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,100
Your blessing is all I need.

103
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,000
Take care of yourself, Roran.

104
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,800
Goodbye, Father.

105
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,800
Be strong, brother.

106
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,600
And work on that aim.

107
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,500
You may make a hunter yet.

108
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,200
Not a stone.

109
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,600
An egg.

110
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:41,100
Well, look at you.

111
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,000
What are you?

112
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,400
Well, you're not a bird.

113
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,800
Where is it?

114
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,100
Too late.

115
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,300
It's hatched.

116
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,600
<i>It's hatched.</i>

117
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,400
Look at what you did.

118
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,200
Eragon, wake up.
Get on with your chores.

119
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,100
Hungry?

120
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,500
Go on.

121
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,100
Drink while it's still warm.

122
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:49,200
I'm sorry. That's all there is.

123
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,200
So much for our rat problem.

124
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,600
My king, Galbatorix.

125
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:29,100
As you feared, the dragon has hatched.

126
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,000
But to a mere farm boy.

127
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,500
To whom is not the issue.

128
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,000
When the Varden learn
that the legend is real...

129
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,900
...they will be encouraged
to challenge me.

130
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:45,800
And I am not interested
in being challenged.

131
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,400
There is no one left for you to fear,
my king.

132
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:57,600
Beyond these borders
are remnants of the resistance.

133
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,600
Dwarves. Elves. The Varden.

134
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,600
I can't let them have hope.

135
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,800
Do not let them reach the Varden.

136
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,100
I will find the boy...

137
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,200
...and kill him before he becomes a man.

138
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,200
Where's your mother?

139
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,100
Did she abandon you too?

140
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,300
Did she leave in a great hurry?

141
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,500
<i>Ra'zac.</i>

142
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,400
<i>Ra'zac.</i>

143
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,800
<i>Ra'zac.</i>

144
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,300
Kill the rider.

145
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,300
Nothing from my boys.

146
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,800
Not a word.

147
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,600
Their mother's heart is broken.

148
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,200
And for what?

149
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,700
More death? More suffering?

150
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:52,200
Easy, Horst. The soldiers will hear you.

151
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,600
What's that matter?

152
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:57,200
Speak or not speak.
It makes no difference.

153
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,900
Quiet, Brom.
A fool like you has nothing to lose.

154
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,300
No argument there.

155
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,400
Don't mind me.

156
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,100
But it wasn't always like this, was it?

157
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:20,100
There was a time when our land flourished
without cruelty and fear.

158
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,700
A time of dragons and Dragon Riders.

159
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:32,200
Those days are long gone.
Old Brom is going on with his stories.

160
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,600
Don't pretend you've forgotten.
Men astride magnificent beasts.

161
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,200
No one could defeat them.

162
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,800
Until, that is, one of their own...

163
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,900
...a rider named Galbatorix...

164
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:51,300
...decided to take all the power for himself
and cut down any rider who opposed him.

165
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,000
Enough, before you hang by a tree.

166
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,800
No!

167
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,900
Let him finish.

168
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:05,900
- And one day, he will pay for his crime.
- Are you deaf? Be on your way!

169
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,100
The time of Dragon Riders...

170
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,100
...will come again.

171
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,400
<i>And then Brom said:</i>

172
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,600
<i>"The time of the Dragon Riders
will come again."</i>

173
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:38,100
Well, first, I think you need to fly.

174
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,000
Yes, you did it!

175
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,800
She's gone.

176
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:02,000
<i>- What's happening?
- Brom was right, Eragon.</i>

177
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:05,200
<i>The time of the Dragon Riders
has come again.</i>

178
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,400
You can hear my thoughts?

179
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,700
<i>I have waited 1000 years
to hear your thoughts.</i>

180
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,200
<i>And now you can hear mine.</i>

181
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,900
<i>I am Saphira. And you are my rider.</i>

182
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,000
Rider?

183
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,300
Get out.

184
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,400
Is it true?

185
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,800
What you spoke of?

186
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,100
Didn't you hear me? Get out.

187
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,100
I want to know more.

188
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,700
Please?

189
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,300
Tell me about the dragons.

190
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,900
Did anybody follow you here?

191
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:57,500
How big will they grow?
When do they breathe fire?

192
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,600
Keep your voice down.

193
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,600
You mocked the king
in front of his soldiers.

194
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:13,200
I always say,
"Better ask forgiveness than permission."

195
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,000
Then tell me.

196
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:18,300
- Tell me about the dragons.
- Go home.

197
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:22,700
Mind your corn. Till your fields. All right?

198
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,500
You'll just get yourself into trouble.

199
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,500
What does it make you, then?

200
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:31,400
A liar or a coward?

201
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,700
I know.

202
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,900
I know your story is true.

203
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,000
I told you.

204
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,300
His name is Eragon.

205
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,300
The boy. The boy took it with him.

206
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,500
He lives on a farm,
the furthest one in the valley.

207
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,200
Please, don't kill me.

208
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,800
<i>Eragon. It's you they want.</i>

209
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,300
<i>- Take me down.
- You're in danger.</i>

210
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,100
What are you doing?
I have to warn my uncle.

211
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,900
<i>It's too late. There's nothing you can do.</i>

212
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,300
<i>Hold on.</i>

213
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,800
<i>You're ridiculous. Hold on.</i>

214
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:40,000
<i>- I'm begging. Please put me down now.
- I can't. They'll kill you.</i>

215
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,700
<i>- Take me down now.
- You stupid boy.</i>

216
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,600
I'm slipping.

217
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,700
Take me down now.

218
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,900
<i>You're giving me no choice.</i>

219
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,500
Uncle? Uncle.

220
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,500
<i>Eragon?</i>

221
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,500
I should have been here.

222
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,800
To warn him.

223
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,600
<i>- This is your fault.
- You would have met the same fate.</i>

224
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,700
No. I could have saved him.

225
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,400
Go away.

226
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,300
And stay away.

227
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,800
Uncle, I'm sorry.

228
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:43,800
- You?
- Let go of me.

229
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,800
- Where's your dragon?
- Gone.

230
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,300
- What do you mean, "gone"?
- I sent her away.

231
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,100
You can't stay here and mourn him--

232
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,700
I'm not going anywhere.
Not until I bury him.

233
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,400
- There.
- What are you doing?

234
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:06,100
A funeral fit for a king. Come.

235
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,900
- Let go.
- Listen...

236
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,700
...they killed him, but they were after you.
If we stay here, we're both dead.

237
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,200
Now get on that horse. Go on.

238
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,300
Get up there.

239
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,100
- Who are you?
- Ride. Now. Go on.

240
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:48,100
Come on, boy. Ride.

241
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:35,700
- Why here?
- Because I said here.

242
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:42,500
- Call your dragon.
- My uncle was killed because of her.

243
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,800
She was protecting you
against the Ra'zac.

244
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,800
- I could have killed them.
- That's the spirit.

245
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,200
One part brave, three parts fool.

246
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,400
What, you don't think I could do it?

247
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:56,400
The Ra'zac kill mercilessly.
That's what they do.

248
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:00,000
- But a boy of 15, 16--
- Seventeen.

249
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:02,900
Seventeen. Forgive me.

250
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:06,200
Well, I think even a 17-year-old boy...

251
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:10,500
...might probably last a minute
against Durza's assassins.

252
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,900
Then I'll find Durza and kill him.

253
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,000
Durza's a Shade.

254
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:22,500
A sorcerer possessed with demonic spirits.

255
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:27,300
Find Durza,
you'll be no better off than your uncle.

256
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:32,600
You just pray to heaven he doesn't find you
because the king won't rest until he does.

257
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,400
You are the Varden's only hope.

258
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,400
- Who are the Varden?
- Rebels. Outcasts.

259
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:43,500
Men who are brave or mad enough
to oppose Galbatorix.

260
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:46,500
They built a stronghold
in the Beor Mountains.

261
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,100
How do you know all this?

262
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:54,300
Because I've been about a bit.

263
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,200
I've seen things...

264
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,700
...you could never imagine.

265
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,400
Now call your dragon.

266
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:11,200
She's far away by now. She can't hear me.

267
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,200
Shall we have an agreement
not to lie to each other?

268
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:19,800
I know she hears your thoughts.
Now call your dragon.

269
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:28,400
<i>Saphira? Can you find us?</i>

270
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,700
<i>I never left you.</i>

271
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:57,800
<i>- I'm sorry for what I said.
- I understand.</i>

272
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,900
<i>You loved him very much.</i>

273
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:07,300
<i>- And who might this be?
- This is Brom.</i>

274
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,500
<i>He knows about dragons.</i>

275
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:14,200
<i>He knows about dragons?
I'll be the judge of that.</i>

276
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,200
<i>Easy. I think he's a friend.</i>

277
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,400
Muscular.

278
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,800
Graceful proportions.

279
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,700
Talons...

280
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,000
...nicely curved.

281
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,100
Legs a bit thin.

282
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,800
<i>Only my voice is gentle, old man.</i>

283
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,700
Spikes sharp.

284
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,900
All in all...

285
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,100
...a fine young dragon.

286
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,100
<i>Well, he does know a bit about dragons.</i>

287
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:55,100
And soon, strong enough to ride.

288
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,800
Not me. I won't do it again.

289
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,700
My story was about you, Eragon.

290
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:05,000
It is your fate to be a Dragon Rider.

291
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:10,300
The Varden need a rider
if they are to defeat Durza and the king.

292
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,900
- I didn't ask for any of this.
- But you were chosen nevertheless.

293
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:19,200
A dragon will only hatch
if it feels the presence of its rider.

294
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,300
It'll wait forever, if it has to.

295
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,100
<i>What he says is true.</i>

296
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,300
But now it's found you.

297
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,600
It will serve you and only you,
and that's put your life in danger.

298
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:35,500
- Because it chose me?
- No.

299
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:40,200
Because the easiest way for the king
to destroy your dragon is to kill you.

300
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:46,300
A rider will live on if his dragon is killed.

301
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,500
But if a rider dies...

302
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,400
<i>So does his dragon.</i>

303
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,800
Handsome blade.

304
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,800
Simple...

305
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,000
...and to the point.

306
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,900
The farm boy evaded the Ra'zac.

307
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,700
Bring me his head.

308
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,800
Durza will send his Urgals after us.

309
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:01,600
Ahead, five hard days ride,
is the river town of Daret...

310
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,800
...the last outpost before the foothills.

311
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:07,000
Now, if we can get there without
being discovered, we have a chance.

312
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:11,300
Tell Saphira to fly above us
and scout the countryside for Urgals...

313
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:15,700
...or worse, Ra'zacs.
If they find us, we'll have no chance.

314
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,500
And tell her only to come to us at night.

315
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:20,700
Do as he says.

316
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,600
<i>But be careful.</i>

317
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:25,000
<i>You be careful.</i>

318
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,600
This way.

319
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:17,700
Urgals. They used to be the king's enemies.
Now they're his guard.

320
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:22,500
Oh, they're closer to us than I thought.
We better stay off the roads.

321
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,000
- Why can't we take them?
- Quiet.

322
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,500
You're not ready to take anything yet.

323
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:33,400
I have skills. I can fight.

324
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:36,900
My cousin, Roran and I.

325
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:39,000
We've trained.

326
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,400
- With swords.
- Well, then...

327
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,800
...perhaps I've underestimated you.

328
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,200
Right, then.
Let's see these skills of yours.

329
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,900
You know, this won't be fair to you,
old man.

330
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,500
Humor me.

331
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,800
Oh, dear.
Well, I see the effect of your training.

332
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,000
Good. Good.

333
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:15,200
Don't get overconfident.

334
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,300
It won't be your cousin Roran
you're fighting.

335
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,800
And it won't be wooden staves, either.

336
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:40,400
<i>I could've beaten him.
I just didn't want to hurt the old man.</i>

337
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:42,700
<i>Of course you could have.</i>

338
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,500
Don't dragons breathe fire?

339
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,400
She's not old enough to sustain a flame.

340
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,900
<i>Lucky for you.</i>

341
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,400
How did you do that?

342
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,900
What did you just do?

343
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:10,300
I started a fire.

344
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,100
<i>He doesn't trust me.</i>

345
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:20,300
<i>Maybe we need to trust him first.</i>

346
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:23,500
Now get to sleep. With any luck,
tomorrow, by the end of the day...

347
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,700
...we will have
slipped through Daret unseen.

348
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:32,500
Then it's the foothills of the Beor Mountains
and a straight shot to the Varden.

349
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:17,100
Eragon, wake up. Come on, wake up.

350
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,700
We're at the village of Daret.

351
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,900
We'll leave the horses here.
Keep Saphira close.

352
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:52,900
Buy us some bread down there.

353
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:55,900
Come back, meet me here.
I won't be long.

354
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,800
Don't talk to anybody.

355
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,600
Do you wish Angela to read your fortune?

356
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:09,800
- But I have no money.
- Did Angela ask for money?

357
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:15,400
Knucklebones of a dragon.

358
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:18,000
They will tell me everything about you.

359
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,300
This is difficult.

360
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,200
A young life so tangled.

361
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:40,600
But you have been long awaited
by many races.

362
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:42,800
Great battles rage around you.

363
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:46,700
It can't be. I don't understand.

364
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:52,000
You have powers you do not acknowledge,
but there is a doom upon you.

365
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:55,200
Part of it lies in a death
that rapidly approaches.

366
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,400
No. It's already happened.

367
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:04,000
And a girl.
She calls to you in your dreams.

368
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,400
She's part of your past...

369
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:09,800
...and your future.

370
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,900
Who is she? Tell me her name.

371
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,600
Do I have to do everything myself?

372
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,500
- The fortuneteller--
- Did she tell you about him, huh?

373
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,100
Come on.

374
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:33,700
Where's everybody gone?

375
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:41,900
- She told me my future.
- The future is for the living, Eragon.

376
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:46,000
Come on!

377
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,200
<i>Saphira!</i>

378
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:40,100
<i>Eragon.</i>

379
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,700
<i>Eragon.</i>

380
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:05,800
My hand. It burns.

381
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,500
Slowly, slowly, slowly.

382
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:11,600
My head.

383
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,800
Feels like I've been kicked by a horse.

384
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:16,500
What happened?

385
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:20,800
Most new Dragon Riders take years to learn
what you discovered by instinct.

386
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:24,300
- What was that?
- Magic.

387
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:29,800
I was only reacting.

388
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,300
Magic comes from dragons.

389
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:38,000
It flows through the riders
who command them.

390
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:43,800
- Saphira.
- She's fine.

391
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:47,800
But she felt your fear as her own.

392
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:51,400
Your bond with her is strong.

393
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,900
- Those were Urgals, weren't they?
- Yes.

394
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,900
- Did I kill them?
- Yes.

395
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:59,800
But death is nothing to celebrate.

396
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:05,000
Magic must be your last resort.

397
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,300
It has rules. It has limitations.

398
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:13,100
Before you cast a spell, you must learn
the ancient language of the elves.

399
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:19,400
<i>Brisingr means "fire." Is fire.</i>

400
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:23,000
The thing is the word.
Know the word and you control the thing.

401
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,600
Before you can cast a spell...

402
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:30,000
...you must have the physical strength
to withstand its effect.

403
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:33,700
Some spells may leave you weakened.

404
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:36,900
Other spells,
as you found out on the bridge...

405
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:39,500
...can leave you unconscious.

406
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:42,900
And yet other spells,
if you use them before you're ready...

407
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:45,100
...will kill you.

408
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:48,100
I can teach you the words...

409
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:52,300
...but the limits of your strength
you must learn for yourself.

410
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:59,900
<i>- What's the word for tree?
- Tree is traevam.</i>

411
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:05,100
And the branch?

412
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:11,400
And when a dragon and rider are truly one,
then they see as one.

413
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:16,200
<i>And that's "skulblakas ven."</i>

414
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:24,900
Well, since we've announced ourselves
so spectacularly to the world...

415
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:28,000
...we're gonna have to find
another way through these hills.

416
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:33,600
Of course, that would be a lot easier
if you were flying.

417
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:41,100
<i>Did someone mention flying?</i>

418
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:45,500
<i>Are you ready to try again, Dragon Rider?</i>

419
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:47,700
<i>I didn't do so well last time.</i>

420
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:50,800
<i>We didn't do so well.</i>

421
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:57,800
<i>You can thank Brom for the saddle.</i>

422
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:05,600
No, that's not so bad up here.

423
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,900
<i>Not so bad at all.</i>

424
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:26,400
Yeah!

425
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,000
<i>Lean.</i>

426
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,100
<i>Not that much!</i>

427
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,400
Feel how she moves, Eragon.

428
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:49,100
How she turns. And when she accelerates.

429
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,000
Come on, let's see what you got.

430
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:53,700
<i>You want speed? Here we go.</i>

431
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:59,000
<i>Hold on, Eragon.</i>

432
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:07,300
<i>You asked for it.</i>

433
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:09,300
There you go.

434
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:19,000
<i>When we're truly one...</i>

435
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:23,200
<i>...you can fight from everywhere,
even from the tail.</i>

436
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:25,300
<i>I wanna try it.</i>

437
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:27,900
<i>Maybe not yet.</i>

438
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,900
<i>Oh, it's easy. I can do this.</i>

439
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,700
<i>Maybe not yet.</i>

440
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:43,100
<i>Maybe not yet.</i>

441
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:52,800
<i>Maybe I can try this.</i>

442
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:59,000
<i>Fantastic.</i>

443
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:05,300
You always see like this?

444
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:08,000
<i>That's nothing. Watch this.</i>

445
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:39,900
What's wrong?

446
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:43,000
<i>Ra'zacs.</i>

447
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,100
Brom.

448
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,500
This time they die. Now, go.

449
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:50,200
<i>With pleasure.</i>

450
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:56,400
Come on. Come on.
Eragon, stay out of this.

451
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:58,600
Lower, Saphira, lower.

452
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:24,700
<i>Eragon. Above you.</i>

453
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:29,300
Come on.

454
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:07,400
Protect your dragon.

455
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:13,700
Your irresponsibility
nearly cost Saphira her life.

456
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:15,900
<i>Don't worry about me.</i>

457
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,300
<i>I'm stronger than he thinks.</i>

458
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:21,400
Do you not listen to anything I tell you?

459
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,100
"Better to ask forgiveness
than permission."

460
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:37,200
Your duty is to reach the Varden alive.

461
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:40,600
Let's talk about truth
before we start talking about duty.

462
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,200
What are you talking about?

463
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:49,600
I thought we agreed
not to lie to one another...

464
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:54,900
...Dragon Rider.

465
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:57,700
<i>Of course.</i>

466
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:02,000
Not anymore.

467
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:10,900
Where's your dragon?

468
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:13,900
Dead.

469
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:24,300
She was murdered by another rider
with this sword...

470
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:26,500
...Za'roc.

471
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,100
<i>That sword is a dragon killer.</i>

472
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:32,600
The rider's name...

473
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:35,900
...was Morzan.

474
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:42,600
Galbatorix won him over.

475
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:49,400
And while she was trying to protect me...

476
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:52,500
...my dragon was killed.

477
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:55,200
<i>Better we...</i>

478
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:58,600
<i>...than our riders.</i>

479
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,400
So I set out to search for Morzan.

480
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:07,400
And I found him.

481
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:14,000
I took his sword
and I drove it through his heart.

482
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,000
And as he died, so did his dragon...

483
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:24,200
...the last, except for the king's.

484
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:29,000
So I hid out in Carvahall...

485
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:32,300
...with a shame...

486
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:36,000
...I rightly deserved.

487
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:42,000
Because of me,
the days of the Dragon Riders were over.

488
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:46,300
Then you came.

489
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:49,000
You both came.

490
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:53,500
<i>And now the days of the riders
have come again.</i>

491
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:30,200
Bring me the boy, I said.

492
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:36,000
Bring me his blood...

493
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:41,500
...I said.

494
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:44,900
But you...

495
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:50,700
...you bring me nothing.

496
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:10,600
You.

497
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:17,900
Congratulations.
You've just been promoted.

498
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:24,600
I tire of this.

499
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:27,700
I'll bring the boy to me.

500
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Tell me your name.

501
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,900
- Eragon.
- Eragon.

502
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:03,600
I am Arya, Princess of Ellesméra.

503
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:05,600
We are allies with the Varden.

504
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:08,300
You're the only one who can save me.

505
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:10,300
But how do I find you?

506
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:13,800
Durza holds me prisoner at Gil'ead.

507
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,700
- Where are you going?
- To find Arya.

508
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:38,100
How do you know that name?

509
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:40,400
She's Durza's prisoner.

510
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:43,000
I'm going to free her.

511
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:47,300
That's out of the question.
Gil'ead's in the opposite direction.

512
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:51,000
We can't go start going back.
We're almost there.

513
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:56,900
I won't let you do that.
It's too much of a risk.

514
00:58:57,100 --> 00:59:00,800
The egg was sent to me.
I'll decide what risks I take. Not you.

515
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:03,500
Eragon, this is more than about just us.

516
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:05,800
- If I don't, she'll be killed.
- Yes.

517
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,600
And it's a sacrifice she's happy to make...

518
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:11,400
...because she values your life over hers.

519
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:14,100
- I won't let her die.
- If she dies...

520
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:17,800
...then she'll join the countless others
who have died waiting for you.

521
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:21,300
As the Varden now wait for you.

522
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:26,500
You must try and understand.
It's your life that's important.

523
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:31,600
I do understand.

524
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:35,400
One false move, one reckless decision...

525
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,800
...and everything is lost.

526
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:43,100
<i>It's good to be brave,
but sometimes it's better to be wise.</i>

527
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,900
- Eragon, listen to me.
- Your shame is not mine.

528
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:53,100
You forgot what it means
to be a Dragon Rider.

529
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:55,800
I will save her.

530
00:59:57,100 --> 00:59:59,100
<i>- Eragon--
- Please don't, Saphira.</i>

531
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:01,400
I'm the rider and I say we go.

532
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:19,200
<i>You'll draw too much attention.</i>

533
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:22,400
<i>We'll have to wait for night
and I'll go in alone.</i>

534
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:26,900
<i>Those walls hold death, Eragon.</i>

535
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:31,900
Not today, not for us.
I'm going to save her life. I can do this.

536
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:34,600
<i>Our power is greatest
when we're together.</i>

537
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:39,000
We can't truly be together
until I become as strong as you.

538
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:46,200
Move along, now.

539
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:50,100
Move faster.

540
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:55,000
Make way.

541
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:59,700
Keep up. Come on.

542
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:17,500
Eragon.

543
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:21,600
- You shouldn't have come.
- But in the woods...

544
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:25,200
Leave me here. Go. Now.

545
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:26,800
It's far too late for that.

546
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:33,800
Forgive me if I stare.

547
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:38,900
I knew you were young, but even then
I expected someone a little more...

548
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:41,800
Well, more.

549
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:05,400
A young magician.

550
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,300
How quaint.

551
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:10,900
Do you already feel it
draining your strength?

552
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:21,200
They say as a Dragon Rider
draws his last breath...

553
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:26,000
...he can hear the dying screams
of his dragon.

554
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:30,800
Out of the way!

555
01:03:34,300 --> 01:03:35,800
No!

556
01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:40,400
You'll have to do much better than that.

557
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:56,300
- Get out.
- No. Not without you.

558
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:58,000
Come on. Let's go.

559
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:01,600
Go.

560
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:09,400
Take Za'roc.

561
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:25,700
Saphira, can you carry three?

562
01:04:26,300 --> 01:04:27,700
<i>Not for very long.</i>

563
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:44,300
I suggest you leave quickly.

564
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:50,300
Come on. Let's get out of here.

565
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:55,200
Come on.

566
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:57,100
- Archers ready.
- Over here.

567
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:00,200
Higher. They're on the roof.

568
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:05,200
<i>I can't. The weight, it's too much.</i>

569
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:25,100
Eragon?

570
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:31,000
Durza...

571
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:33,500
- Durza...
- Durza's dead.

572
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:36,400
Did you pierce him through the heart?

573
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:42,600
You can only kill a Shade
if you pierce him through the heart.

574
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:48,200
- We must get help.
- Where?

575
01:05:49,100 --> 01:05:51,700
- From the Varden.
- Yes.

576
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:54,000
Go to the Varden.

577
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:59,100
Take this.

578
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:05,100
Go...

579
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:07,500
...without me.

580
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:11,700
No. I need you.

581
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:13,700
No, Eragon.

582
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:17,900
It's I who've always needed you.

583
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:22,800
You gave me my life back again.

584
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,600
Take care of Saphira.

585
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:30,500
Without her...

586
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:35,300
...you'll find life is hardly worth living.

587
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:38,100
I won't let you die.

588
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:40,800
Not for my mistake.

589
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:09,800
You are not strong enough...

590
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:12,600
...yet.

591
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:17,100
That's the spirit.

592
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:21,800
One part brave, three parts fool.

593
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:30,000
Forgive me.

594
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:36,000
<i>Eragon. Let him die with pride...</i>

595
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:44,400
<i>...as a Dragon Rider.</i>

596
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:30,600
<i>I can't breathe fire yet...</i>

597
01:08:32,300 --> 01:08:35,000
<i>...but I can do this for Brom:</i>

598
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:48,900
<i>Now time cannot ravage him.</i>

599
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,700
Who will remember him?

600
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:55,500
Many people will...

601
01:08:55,700 --> 01:08:57,200
...because of you.

602
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:53,300
<i>Eragon.</i>

603
01:09:56,300 --> 01:09:59,700
<i>A Shade has poisoned her.
Someone's coming.</i>

604
01:10:07,900 --> 01:10:11,100
I need to get you to the Varden.
How do I find them?

605
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:36,300
<i>- This one's been following us.
- Stand up.</i>

606
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:41,300
All my life, I dreamed of dragons.

607
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:44,300
Who are you?
And why are you following us?

608
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:47,300
I'm Murtagh.
And you need me, Dragon Rider.

609
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:50,600
- Thanks, but I'll be fine without you.
- You seek the Varden.

610
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:55,700
I know the mountains,
every valley and stream.

611
01:10:56,700 --> 01:10:59,000
She'll suffer if you go astray.

612
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:02,400
Why did you risk your life for us?

613
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:05,800
My family was slaughtered
by the king's men when I was a boy.

614
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:09,900
I heard rumors.
They said a rider had appeared.

615
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:13,800
<i>Eragon. We must go.</i>

616
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:19,900
If there were ever a time for retribution,
this was it.

617
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:23,100
If you can show me
the quickest way to the Varden...

618
01:11:23,300 --> 01:11:25,000
To the Varden it is.

619
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:34,000
You'll learn to trust me, Dragon Rider.

620
01:11:39,700 --> 01:11:41,700
I'm not the only one
you need to convince.

621
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:14,900
We'll have to go by foot from here.

622
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:23,800
<i>Saphira? Keep Arya safe until I call.</i>

623
01:12:23,900 --> 01:12:27,800
<i>I will, but hurry. The Urgals are closing in.</i>

624
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:50,600
Thanks again.

625
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:52,700
Don't mention it.

626
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:57,600
Tell me your vision
looked something like this.

627
01:12:58,700 --> 01:13:00,400
Come on.

628
01:13:35,700 --> 01:13:38,900
The task was simple: bring the boy to me.

629
01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:42,500
There were complications.

630
01:13:42,700 --> 01:13:44,700
Yes, so I've heard.

631
01:13:44,900 --> 01:13:47,600
Complications do tend to happen.

632
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:52,200
But fortunately for you,
your incompetence may work in my favor.

633
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:55,500
The boy has led us directly to the Varden.

634
01:13:56,700 --> 01:14:00,900
And so the job falls upon you, Durza...

635
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:05,700
...to remind those who resist my rule...

636
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:09,100
...that as long as I am king...

637
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:14,200
...disloyalty will be punishable by death.

638
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:20,200
Gather my army and follow them.

639
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:23,400
Leave no one alive.

640
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:28,400
- Move up there.
- Come on, get them on there.

641
01:14:32,900 --> 01:14:34,400
Which one of you is the rider?

642
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:36,600
I am. My name is Eragon.

643
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:41,400
I am Ajihad, leader of the Varden.

644
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:44,200
If you are the rider, call your beast inside.

645
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:47,700
If it attacks, you will die first.

646
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:53,100
<i>Saphira? Bring Arya, but be cautious.</i>

647
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:15,300
<i>How is Arya?</i>

648
01:15:15,700 --> 01:15:17,900
<i>She's holding on.</i>

649
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:21,000
<i>Her heart beats faintly.</i>

650
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:32,700
She's been poisoned by a Shade.

651
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:36,600
Our healers will make her well.

652
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:38,100
Watch over Arya.

653
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:39,500
<i>But be careful.</i>

654
01:15:40,300 --> 01:15:42,900
<i>You be careful.</i>

655
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:09,500
- There are Urgals on the mountain.
- Urgals.

656
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:13,000
They're scouring the mountain
as we speak.

657
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:16,100
Time is short.
I must know if you're with us.

658
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:19,200
We'll be greatly outnumbered.

659
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:24,700
We've come to join you.

660
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:46,100
- Seize him.
- No.

661
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:54,400
He's with me. He saved my life.

662
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:58,700
He is the son of Morzan, the traitor.

663
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:03,900
Is it true?

664
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:07,400
A son doesn't choose his father.

665
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:11,400
This was the only thing he ever gave me.

666
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:16,900
I hated that man until the day he died.

667
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:20,800
Lock him up.
If he tries to escape, kill him.

668
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:24,900
- Let go of me.
- I've no time to take chances.

669
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:29,200
The Urgals' presence here can only mean
that the king's men are not far behind.

670
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:34,600
These cowards will hide no more.

671
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:39,200
Tonight, we destroy the resistance.

672
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:46,100
Annihilate.

673
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:58,100
But the boy is mine.

674
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:13,300
- Excuse me. I should have knocked.
- It's fine.

675
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:15,700
My father asked me to bring you to him.

676
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:20,100
I'll be ready in just a moment.

677
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:25,800
Arya has responded well
to our healers' work.

678
01:18:25,900 --> 01:18:29,000
- Her strength runs deep.
- When can I see her?

679
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:33,700
She's resting now.
Only she can answer that.

680
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:53,900
Check those rails.

681
01:18:55,300 --> 01:18:57,000
They're afraid of me.

682
01:18:57,500 --> 01:18:59,500
Why wouldn't they be?

683
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:03,800
There's no retreat from here,
nowhere else to hide.

684
01:19:03,900 --> 01:19:06,700
The suspicion has kept us alive
all these years.

685
01:19:08,100 --> 01:19:11,400
When word spread
of a new Dragon Rider...

686
01:19:12,100 --> 01:19:15,700
...we were expecting someone
who was more...

687
01:19:16,100 --> 01:19:19,000
- ...well...
- More than me.

688
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:24,400
I've heard it before.

689
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:27,200
More heat. Add more heat.

690
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:31,200
- Your armor is ready for you.
- Take your positions.

691
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:33,300
Come on, harder.

692
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:35,800
We must prepare for battle.

693
01:19:54,900 --> 01:19:59,100
It's not as easy as it looks, is it?

694
01:20:04,900 --> 01:20:08,500
You look fit for battle.

695
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:14,400
- Positions.
- Ready?

696
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:17,100
Urgals are here.

697
01:20:17,300 --> 01:20:19,200
Be strong, Eragon.

698
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:23,100
The search for a rider
has been long and dangerous.

699
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:26,400
Some of us have carried the egg
for as long as we can remember...

700
01:20:26,500 --> 01:20:32,000
...hoping it would hatch,
when fate finally carried it to you.

701
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:35,600
Why me?
I'm just a farm boy from Carvahall.

702
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:40,100
Because that is who Saphira chose.

703
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:47,300
I barely even recognize myself.

704
01:21:00,900 --> 01:21:02,500
They worked through the night...

705
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:05,600
...to protect our greatest hope...

706
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:08,700
...and our leader who rides her.

707
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:15,200
It's time.

708
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,300
Take your positions.

709
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:08,100
Ready the archers!

710
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:09,400
I need to know, Saphira. Why me?

711
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:12,800
<i>You choose a leader for his heart.</i>

712
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:15,900
But I'm not without fear.

713
01:23:16,100 --> 01:23:18,800
<i>Without fear there cannot be courage.</i>

714
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:23,900
<i>But when we are together,
it is our enemies who should be afraid.</i>

715
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:26,500
And are we together, Saphira?

716
01:23:27,700 --> 01:23:29,600
As one?

717
01:23:38,700 --> 01:23:40,900
I'll take that as a yes.

718
01:23:47,100 --> 01:23:48,700
Loose!

719
01:23:56,600 --> 01:23:58,300
Now!

720
01:24:00,300 --> 01:24:03,500
<i>Into the sky, to win or die!</i>

721
01:24:10,100 --> 01:24:11,700
Fire!

722
01:24:20,100 --> 01:24:21,500
Yeah!

723
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:29,600
Let me out! Let me out!

724
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:33,600
Let me out of here! Let--!

725
01:26:14,100 --> 01:26:17,700
- Oh, no.
- Time to return the favor.

726
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:24,900
I guess we're even!

727
01:26:43,300 --> 01:26:46,200
Come! Taste the blood of your dragon!

728
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,500
Let's finish this.

729
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:02,700
What is that thing?

730
01:27:02,900 --> 01:27:04,800
<i>Dark magic.</i>

731
01:27:09,100 --> 01:27:11,400
Closer, so we can reach his heart.

732
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:14,300
<i>This time, rip it out of his chest.</i>

733
01:27:57,600 --> 01:27:58,800
Saphira!

734
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:00,800
Hear her scream!

735
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:18,200
Saphira, you're hurt.

736
01:28:18,900 --> 01:28:20,900
<i>Don't worry about me.</i>

737
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:23,300
<i>Keep your mind in the fight.</i>

738
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:45,400
What's happening? My vision's failing.

739
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:48,600
<i>It is not you, but me.</i>

740
01:28:50,700 --> 01:28:53,200
<i>This wound weakens me.</i>

741
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:59,500
Easy, Saphira.
We're gonna get through this together.

742
01:29:04,900 --> 01:29:06,300
<i>I'm losing strength.</i>

743
01:29:11,100 --> 01:29:13,200
I know what I have to do.

744
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:31,300
Now!

745
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:43,600
That's for Brom.

746
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:48,100
I expected more.

747
01:30:26,700 --> 01:30:28,300
Saphira!

748
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:47,900
<i>We did it.</i>

749
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:50,200
Saphira?

750
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:53,800
<i>Together.</i>

751
01:30:57,200 --> 01:31:02,700
Whatever life there is in me, take it.

752
01:31:02,900 --> 01:31:05,900
<i>Eragon, no.</i>

753
01:31:09,700 --> 01:31:13,000
<i>Even you don't have a heart...</i>

754
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:17,300
<i>...strong enough for both of us.</i>

755
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:08,700
Slowly, rider.

756
01:33:10,200 --> 01:33:11,900
Saphira?

757
01:33:15,300 --> 01:33:18,000
Some friends can't be replaced.

758
01:33:30,300 --> 01:33:32,400
Well, luckily, some don't have to be.

759
01:33:34,900 --> 01:33:37,700
Saphira. I didn't think I could do it.

760
01:33:37,800 --> 01:33:42,100
<i>You shouldn't have. It was reckless...</i>

761
01:33:42,500 --> 01:33:43,900
<i>...but I'm glad you did.</i>

762
01:33:44,700 --> 01:33:47,400
Wasn't it an old, wise man who once said:

763
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:50,500
"One part brave, three parts fool"?

764
01:33:51,800 --> 01:33:54,900
<i>Brom would be proud of you.</i>

765
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:58,700
<i>Of us.</i>

766
01:34:01,100 --> 01:34:02,400
And Arya?

767
01:34:02,600 --> 01:34:06,100
Thought that might come up.
Get changed.

768
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:08,500
She's off to Ellesméra.

769
01:34:08,700 --> 01:34:12,300
<i>But what horse was ever born
that could outrun a dragon?</i>

770
01:35:00,100 --> 01:35:02,700
You never gave me a chance
to say goodbye.

771
01:35:02,900 --> 01:35:05,200
There was no time.

772
01:35:05,400 --> 01:35:08,500
Galbatorix will try to avenge this defeat.

773
01:35:08,600 --> 01:35:11,000
I must return to my people in Ellesméra.

774
01:35:11,200 --> 01:35:13,400
And you must prepare the Varden.

775
01:35:19,300 --> 01:35:21,600
You lost those who were dear to you.

776
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:25,200
You've paid a great price for your courage.

777
01:35:29,100 --> 01:35:32,300
Did you know the people of the Varden
already tell stories about you?

778
01:35:34,300 --> 01:35:36,500
Legend of Eragon,
the great Shade-slayer...

779
01:35:36,700 --> 01:35:38,500
...spreads throughout Alagaësia.

780
01:35:40,100 --> 01:35:42,300
Well, you know how legends go.

781
01:35:42,500 --> 01:35:45,100
People will believe
just about anything these days.

782
01:35:48,500 --> 01:35:50,200
When will I see you again?

783
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:56,400
Time moves quickly.

784
01:35:56,600 --> 01:36:01,400
Only yesterday you were a farm boy.
Today you are a hero.

785
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:07,700
Tomorrow may see us together again.

786
01:36:11,300 --> 01:36:13,700
Then I'll be waiting for tomorrow.

787
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:23,700
<i>Tomorrow will come...</i>

788
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:26,500
<i>...sooner than you think.</i>

789
01:36:34,700 --> 01:36:36,700
Take care of him, Saphira.

790
01:36:36,900 --> 01:36:38,600
<i>I will.</i>

791
01:36:55,800 --> 01:36:57,400
Come.
