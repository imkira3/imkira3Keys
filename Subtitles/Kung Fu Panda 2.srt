00:00:21,273 --> 00:00:24,274
<i>Long ago, in ancient China,</i>

3
00:00:24,443 --> 00:00:27,647
<i>the Peacocks ruled over Gongmen City.</i>

4
00:00:28,447 --> 00:00:32,280
<i>They brought great joy
and prosperity to the city</i>

5
00:00:32,452 --> 00:00:35,785
<i>for they had invented fireworks.</i>

6
00:00:39,167 --> 00:00:41,919
<i>But their son, Lord Shen,</i>

7
00:00:42,087 --> 00:00:45,503
<i>saw darker power in the fireworks.</i>

8
00:00:46,717 --> 00:00:49,208
<i>What had brought colour and joy</i>

9
00:00:49,387 --> 00:00:53,764
<i>could also bring darkness
and destruction.</i>

10
00:00:53,933 --> 00:00:57,717
<i>Shen's troubled parents
consulted a soothsayer.</i>

11
00:00:57,896 --> 00:01:03,187
<i>She foretold that if Shen
continued down this dark path,</i>

12
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:08,355
<i>he would be defeated
by a warrior of black and white.</i>

13
00:01:09,491 --> 00:01:13,110
<i>The young lord
set out to change his fate.</i>

14
00:01:13,287 --> 00:01:18,115
<i>But what he did next only sealed it.</i>

15
00:01:23,131 --> 00:01:26,999
<i>Shen returned to his parents
full of pride.</i>

16
00:01:27,177 --> 00:01:31,306
<i>But in their faces, he saw only horror.</i>

17
00:01:33,058 --> 00:01:35,894
<i>He was banished from the city forever.</i>

18
00:01:36,062 --> 00:01:39,265
<i>But Shen swore revenge.</i>

19
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,276
<i>Someday he would return</i>

20
00:01:42,444 --> 00:01:46,311
<i>and all of China would bow at his feet.</i>

21
00:02:17,773 --> 00:02:20,691
It's almost done, Lord Shen,
but we've run out of metal.

22
00:02:22,278 --> 00:02:26,775
Search the farthest villages!
Find more metal!

23
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:28,824
China will be mine.

24
00:02:38,963 --> 00:02:42,166
And then the Dragon Warrior
joined the Furious Five!

25
00:02:42,341 --> 00:02:45,212
And they became the most
awesomest kung fu team ever!

26
00:02:45,386 --> 00:02:47,213
Enough talk. Let's fight!

27
00:02:48,473 --> 00:02:49,552
- Thirty-three...
- Listen, listen!

28
00:02:49,724 --> 00:02:52,050
You can hear the Dragon Warrior
training right now!

29
00:02:52,227 --> 00:02:53,638
Thirty-three. Stop him!

30
00:02:53,812 --> 00:02:55,057
- Thirty-four.
- It's too dangerous!

31
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:57,556
- Thirty-five. Stay focused.
- Thirty-six!

32
00:02:57,733 --> 00:02:59,393
- Thirty-seven!
- Yeah!

33
00:02:59,568 --> 00:03:02,024
How is he doing that with his face?

34
00:03:05,741 --> 00:03:08,363
Thirty-eight bean buns!

35
00:03:08,536 --> 00:03:11,074
Yes! New record! You monster!

36
00:03:11,247 --> 00:03:13,536
- Keep going! Hit 40!
- He'll never hit 40.

37
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:15,915
You guys wait and we'll go to 40.

38
00:03:16,086 --> 00:03:17,201
Do it.

39
00:03:17,379 --> 00:03:18,790
No problem!

40
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,544
Yeah!

41
00:03:24,678 --> 00:03:26,089
Give me a minute.

42
00:03:27,348 --> 00:03:28,759
Yeah!

43
00:03:29,767 --> 00:03:31,974
- He did it!
- Well done, Po!

44
00:03:33,563 --> 00:03:34,974
Your training has paid off.

45
00:03:36,274 --> 00:03:38,350
Master Shifu!
Gotta go. See you later!

46
00:03:39,403 --> 00:03:41,442
You'll save those for me, right?

47
00:03:49,872 --> 00:03:51,283
Flippety-do.

48
00:04:01,927 --> 00:04:03,505
Inner peace.

49
00:04:06,515 --> 00:04:09,006
Inner peace.

50
00:04:12,271 --> 00:04:14,098
Inner peace.

51
00:04:14,273 --> 00:04:15,684
Master Shifu.

52
00:04:16,651 --> 00:04:18,560
Master Shifu, what do we got?

53
00:04:18,737 --> 00:04:21,654
Pirates? Vandals of Volcano Mountain?

54
00:04:21,823 --> 00:04:25,868
Whatever it is, I will take them down.
'Cause I am in a mood.

55
00:04:26,036 --> 00:04:28,444
I need to get something done,
you know what I mean?

56
00:04:30,374 --> 00:04:31,619
What are you doing?

57
00:04:31,792 --> 00:04:35,208
One of Master Oogway's final teachings.

58
00:05:06,454 --> 00:05:07,486
Awesome!

59
00:05:07,664 --> 00:05:10,582
How did you do that?

60
00:05:10,751 --> 00:05:14,749
- Inner peace.
- Inner piece. That's cool.

61
00:05:15,673 --> 00:05:19,256
- Inner piece of what?
- It is the next phase of your training.

62
00:05:19,427 --> 00:05:25,263
Every master must find his path
to inner peace.

63
00:05:25,433 --> 00:05:29,597
Some choose to meditate for 50 years
in a cave just like this...

64
00:05:31,648 --> 00:05:34,768
...without the slightest taste
of food or water.

65
00:05:36,528 --> 00:05:37,608
Or?

66
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:41,231
Some find it through
pain and suffering, as I did.

67
00:05:41,409 --> 00:05:44,778
Po, the day you were chosen
as Dragon Warrior

68
00:05:44,954 --> 00:05:46,781
was the worst day of my life.

69
00:05:47,665 --> 00:05:50,204
By far.
Nothing else came close.

70
00:05:50,377 --> 00:05:54,754
It was the worst, most painful,
mind-destroying, horrible moment...

71
00:05:54,923 --> 00:05:57,379
- OK.
...I have ever experienced.

72
00:06:01,389 --> 00:06:05,469
But once I realised the problem
was not you, but within me,

73
00:06:05,643 --> 00:06:11,230
I found inner peace and was able
to harness the flow of the universe.

74
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:13,937
So that's it? I just need inner peace?

75
00:06:14,111 --> 00:06:16,234
My innards are
already super, super peaceful,

76
00:06:16,405 --> 00:06:19,821
so all I need to do
is just get this thing going.

77
00:06:19,992 --> 00:06:21,949
Inner peace, you're going down.

78
00:06:22,119 --> 00:06:23,911
Now show me what you were
doing there with your feet.

79
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,159
I saw you do sort of a fancy foot...

80
00:06:25,331 --> 00:06:28,332
Po! Bandits!
Approaching the Musicians Village.

81
00:06:28,501 --> 00:06:29,580
Danger.

82
00:06:29,752 --> 00:06:33,667
Tell those musicians to start playing
some action music because it is on.

83
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,212
Don't worry, Shifu, I'll master
inner peace as soon as I get back.

84
00:06:36,384 --> 00:06:38,009
No snack stops this time.

85
00:06:39,012 --> 00:06:40,886
Snack stops.

86
00:06:41,056 --> 00:06:42,764
Wait, are you serious?

87
00:06:55,321 --> 00:06:57,398
Get all the metal you can find!

88
00:07:01,453 --> 00:07:02,734
Grab the metal!

89
00:07:08,335 --> 00:07:10,577
Help, help, help, help. Help!

90
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,042
That's everything!
Let's get out of here.

91
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,335
Oh, no.

92
00:07:23,685 --> 00:07:25,678
Wings of Justice!

93
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:45,864
The Dragon Warrior!

94
00:07:46,043 --> 00:07:48,332
A panda? That's impossible.

95
00:07:48,504 --> 00:07:50,413
My fist hungers for justice.

96
00:07:51,632 --> 00:07:53,292
That was my... fist.

97
00:07:53,467 --> 00:07:55,793
- Get 'em!
- Come on!

98
00:08:19,036 --> 00:08:20,365
Take that!

99
00:08:30,757 --> 00:08:32,382
Po! Incoming!

100
00:08:32,551 --> 00:08:34,378
Thanks, Mantis!

101
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:54,650
Tigress, Double Death Strike!

102
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:04,490
Feet of Fury!

103
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,337
Tigress! Monkey!

104
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:13,467
Viper! Mantis!

105
00:09:13,637 --> 00:09:15,464
Bunny! What?

106
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:17,463
Oh, sorry.

107
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:24,554
Help!

108
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:27,649
- Crane, go!
- I'm on it!

109
00:09:46,797 --> 00:09:48,375
Is everyone OK?

110
00:09:48,925 --> 00:09:50,964
That was awesome!

111
00:09:53,722 --> 00:09:54,753
I got this.

112
00:10:06,068 --> 00:10:07,349
Po!

113
00:10:13,618 --> 00:10:15,160
Chew on that, tubby!

114
00:10:21,293 --> 00:10:22,668
Help.

115
00:10:24,755 --> 00:10:27,080
- Sweetie, are you OK?
- What happened?

116
00:10:28,717 --> 00:10:30,426
I think I saw...

117
00:10:30,594 --> 00:10:32,920
I think...

118
00:10:33,097 --> 00:10:34,508
I gotta go.

119
00:10:36,851 --> 00:10:42,094
Thank you. Thank you for coming
to Dragon Warrior Noodles and Tofu.

120
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:44,017
- More tea? Lemon sauce?
- No.

121
00:10:44,192 --> 00:10:46,944
If you need anything, just ask.

122
00:10:47,863 --> 00:10:50,817
- Thank you.
- Feet of Fury!

123
00:10:50,991 --> 00:10:55,452
The Dragon Warrior's mop.
He mopped these very floors!

124
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,951
No touching!
You'll get the mop dirty.

125
00:10:59,584 --> 00:11:01,458
- He once waited on me.
- Awesome!

126
00:11:01,628 --> 00:11:05,542
Yeah, I have the stain to prove it.
Hey, where is the Dragon Warrior?

127
00:11:05,716 --> 00:11:08,041
He doesn't work here any more.

128
00:11:08,218 --> 00:11:11,718
He's busy out there
protecting the Valley.

129
00:11:11,889 --> 00:11:13,383
- The Dragon Warrior!
- There he is.

130
00:11:13,557 --> 00:11:14,589
Po!

131
00:11:16,727 --> 00:11:19,219
- Here. OK. Nice kid.
- The Dragon Warrior!

132
00:11:19,397 --> 00:11:21,639
- Should've told me you were coming.
- Hi, Dad.

133
00:11:21,816 --> 00:11:24,058
I would have saved you
some stinky tofu.

134
00:11:25,737 --> 00:11:28,738
- Dad, can I talk to you?
- Of course, son.

135
00:11:29,491 --> 00:11:35,078
In honour of my son,
free tofu dessert for everybody!

136
00:11:35,247 --> 00:11:37,121
With purchases.

137
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:40,910
Oh, it's so good to see you, Po.

138
00:11:41,087 --> 00:11:44,705
Have you lost weight? I can
almost put my wings around you.

139
00:11:44,883 --> 00:11:46,543
Ah, well, maybe a little.

140
00:11:46,718 --> 00:11:50,550
Poor you, you must feel weak.
Let me get you some soup.

141
00:11:50,722 --> 00:11:52,300
No, that's OK, Dad.
I'm not hungry.

142
00:11:52,474 --> 00:11:55,144
Not hungry?
Po, are you all right?

143
00:11:55,311 --> 00:11:57,268
Yeah. No, I'm fine. I just...

144
00:11:57,438 --> 00:11:59,763
Earlier today,
I was fighting these bandits.

145
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:03,191
Nothing too dangerous.
I mean, they were just, you know...

146
00:12:03,361 --> 00:12:06,315
- Yeah?
- And then the strangest thing happened.

147
00:12:06,489 --> 00:12:08,197
I had this crazy vision.

148
00:12:08,366 --> 00:12:12,150
I think I saw my mom and me,
as a baby.

149
00:12:12,663 --> 00:12:14,951
Mom? A baby?

150
00:12:15,123 --> 00:12:18,493
- Dad?
- What...?

151
00:12:19,628 --> 00:12:21,668
How do I say this?

152
00:12:23,174 --> 00:12:25,167
Where did I come from?

153
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:34,845
Well, you see, son,
baby geese come from a little egg.

154
00:12:35,228 --> 00:12:39,689
- Don't ask where the egg comes from.
- Dad, that's not what I meant.

155
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:43,066
I know it's not.

156
00:12:43,237 --> 00:12:48,528
I think it's time I told you something
I should have told you a long time ago.

157
00:12:49,327 --> 00:12:50,490
OK.

158
00:12:50,662 --> 00:12:54,494
You might have been kind of a...

159
00:12:58,003 --> 00:12:59,663
...adopted.

160
00:12:59,838 --> 00:13:01,665
- I knew it.
- You knew?

161
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,795
- Well, who told you?
- No one. I mean, come on, Dad.

162
00:13:04,969 --> 00:13:07,804
But if you knew,
why didn't you ever say anything?

163
00:13:07,972 --> 00:13:09,846
Why didn't you say anything?

164
00:13:12,185 --> 00:13:14,854
How did I get here, Dad?
Where did I come from?

165
00:13:16,565 --> 00:13:20,016
Actually... you came from this.

166
00:13:23,947 --> 00:13:26,783
It was just another day
at the restaurant.

167
00:13:26,951 --> 00:13:28,575
Time to make the noodles.

168
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:33,866
<i>I went out to the back, where my
vegetables had just been delivered.</i>

169
00:13:34,042 --> 00:13:36,747
<i>There were cabbages, turnips, radishes.</i>

170
00:13:37,921 --> 00:13:40,542
<i>Only there were no radishes.</i>

171
00:13:40,715 --> 00:13:44,132
<i>Just a very hungry baby panda.</i>

172
00:13:46,972 --> 00:13:48,716
<i>There was no note.</i>

173
00:13:48,891 --> 00:13:50,931
<i>Of course, you could have eaten it.</i>

174
00:13:51,102 --> 00:13:56,097
<i>I waited for someone to come
looking for you, but no one did.</i>

175
00:14:20,091 --> 00:14:22,084
<i>I brought you inside.</i>

176
00:14:24,346 --> 00:14:25,970
<i>Fed you.</i>

177
00:14:27,641 --> 00:14:29,135
<i>Gave you a bath.</i>

178
00:14:32,146 --> 00:14:34,139
<i>And fed you again.</i>

179
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:38,234
<i>And again.</i>

180
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:43,116
<i>And tried to put some pants on you.</i>

181
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:55,659
<i>And then I made a decision
that would change my life forever.</i>

182
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,960
<i>To make my soup without radishes.</i>

183
00:15:01,135 --> 00:15:05,382
<i>And to raise you as my own son.</i>

184
00:15:05,557 --> 00:15:09,768
<i>Xiao Po, my little panda.</i>

185
00:15:10,979 --> 00:15:15,309
<i>And from that moment on,
both my soup and my life</i>

186
00:15:15,484 --> 00:15:17,643
have been that much sweeter.

187
00:15:18,696 --> 00:15:21,816
And, little Po,
that's the end of the story.

188
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:26,160
Look at me. No, don't look at me.

189
00:15:26,329 --> 00:15:30,825
That's it? That can't be it.
There's gotta be more, Dad!

190
00:15:31,001 --> 00:15:35,212
Well, there was the time
you ate all my bamboo furniture.

191
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,373
It was imported, too.

192
00:15:37,966 --> 00:15:40,718
One dumpling, please,
Dragon Warrior size.

193
00:15:46,059 --> 00:15:49,926
Oh, Po, your story may not
have such a happy beginning,

194
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:51,605
but look how it turned out.

195
00:15:51,773 --> 00:15:55,522
You got me, you got kung fu,
and you got noodles.

196
00:15:55,694 --> 00:15:58,363
I know. I just have so many questions.

197
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:00,938
Like how did I ever fit
in this tiny basket?

198
00:16:01,116 --> 00:16:02,776
Why didn't I like pants?

199
00:16:05,121 --> 00:16:07,113
And who am I?

200
00:16:14,255 --> 00:16:16,213
Good. Watch your form.

201
00:16:18,927 --> 00:16:20,386
Good.

202
00:16:21,972 --> 00:16:24,759
Better. Elbow.

203
00:16:24,934 --> 00:16:26,926
Straighten it out!

204
00:16:52,713 --> 00:16:54,920
Shen?

205
00:16:55,091 --> 00:16:58,045
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

206
00:16:58,219 --> 00:17:02,965
Now we've got the pleasantries
out of the way, please leave my house.

207
00:17:03,141 --> 00:17:05,264
- Your house?
- Yes.

208
00:17:05,435 --> 00:17:07,927
Didn't you see the peacock
on the front door?

209
00:17:09,899 --> 00:17:12,057
There you are, Soothsayer.

210
00:17:12,652 --> 00:17:17,397
It seems your fortune-telling skills
are not as good as you thought.

211
00:17:17,574 --> 00:17:21,572
- We shall see, Shen.
- No, you shall see, old goat.

212
00:17:21,745 --> 00:17:24,283
- Where were we?
- What do you want, Shen?

213
00:17:24,456 --> 00:17:28,952
What is rightfully mine. Gongmen City!

214
00:17:29,128 --> 00:17:31,797
Gongmen is under the stewardship
of the Masters' Council,

215
00:17:31,964 --> 00:17:35,796
and we will protect it. Even from you.

216
00:17:36,969 --> 00:17:40,220
I'm so glad you feel that way.

217
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:43,225
Otherwise, I'd have dragged
that here for nothing.

218
00:17:43,393 --> 00:17:45,433
What's in the box, Shen?

219
00:17:45,604 --> 00:17:49,139
You want to see? It's a gift.

220
00:17:49,316 --> 00:17:53,100
It's your parting gift,
in that it will part you.

221
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:54,821
Part of you here, part of you there

222
00:17:54,989 --> 00:17:58,939
and part of you way over there,
staining the wall!

223
00:17:59,118 --> 00:18:01,111
You insolent fool!

224
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:21,635
- Show-off.
- That is a warning.

225
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:24,645
You are no match for our kung fu.

226
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,770
I agree.

227
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,648
But this is.

228
00:18:42,623 --> 00:18:45,375
Are you familiar
with the master of Gongmen City?

229
00:18:45,543 --> 00:18:46,872
- Master Thundering Rhino?
- Yes.

230
00:18:47,045 --> 00:18:49,618
- Son of legendary Flying Rhino?
- Yes.

231
00:18:49,798 --> 00:18:52,752
And slayer of the Ten Thousand
Serpents in the Valley of Woe?

232
00:18:52,926 --> 00:18:54,966
- He's dead.
- Whoa.

233
00:18:55,137 --> 00:18:56,335
That's impossible.

234
00:18:56,513 --> 00:18:58,969
Rhino's Horn Defence
is impervious to any technique.

235
00:18:59,141 --> 00:19:02,641
It was no technique.
Lord Shen has created a weapon,

236
00:19:02,812 --> 00:19:05,219
one that breathes fire and spits metal.

237
00:19:05,857 --> 00:19:10,733
Unless he is stopped,
this could be the end of kung fu.

238
00:19:11,404 --> 00:19:15,272
- But I just got kung fu!
- And now you must save it.

239
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:19,365
Go! Destroy this weapon
and bring Lord Shen to justice!

240
00:19:19,538 --> 00:19:21,365
OK, here we go! Here we go!

241
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:25,246
Wait a second.
How can I do this?

242
00:19:25,419 --> 00:19:28,041
I mean, how can kung fu stop
something that stops kung fu?

243
00:19:28,214 --> 00:19:30,123
Remember, Dragon Warrior,

244
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:33,669
anything is possible
when you have inner peace.

245
00:19:39,393 --> 00:19:42,098
Inner peace. Inner peace. Inner peace.

246
00:19:42,938 --> 00:19:44,017
Peace on.

247
00:19:44,189 --> 00:19:46,229
- Oh, Po?
- Peace!

248
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,523
Oh, Po, I got you a travel pack.

249
00:19:48,694 --> 00:19:51,779
I packed you food for weeks.
Cookies, buns, vegetables.

250
00:19:51,948 --> 00:19:55,198
And I even packed
all your action figures. See?

251
00:19:58,288 --> 00:20:01,574
I don't know what those are.
Never seen them before in my life.

252
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,624
Dad, you got scratches on my Tigress.

253
00:20:03,794 --> 00:20:06,665
I also packed your paintings
of our best time together,

254
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:09,377
just in case you get lonely.

255
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:13,382
That's me and you making noodles.
And that's me and you eating noodles.

256
00:20:13,554 --> 00:20:15,962
And that's me giving you
a piggyback ride.

257
00:20:17,433 --> 00:20:20,388
That cute? On second thought,
I'll hang on to this one.

258
00:20:20,562 --> 00:20:24,430
- Hey, they're waiting for me.
- Of course, of course.

259
00:20:24,608 --> 00:20:27,775
You have a job to do... far from home,

260
00:20:27,945 --> 00:20:31,646
in a strange city, filled with
strange people, and strange noodles,

261
00:20:31,824 --> 00:20:35,573
facing horrible danger
from which you might never return!

262
00:20:35,745 --> 00:20:38,318
- Don't go, Po!
- I gotta go.

263
00:20:38,498 --> 00:20:41,784
I'm the Dragon Warrior.
It's kind of my job to save kung fu.

264
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,914
And if I don't... what am I?

265
00:20:45,088 --> 00:20:47,544
You're my son.

266
00:20:50,219 --> 00:20:51,333
Right?

267
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,764
- Po, it's time.
- Goodbye.

268
00:20:57,852 --> 00:20:59,263
Don't worry, Mr. Ping.

269
00:20:59,437 --> 00:21:01,809
He'll be back before
you can say "noodles".

270
00:21:07,529 --> 00:21:09,522
Noodles.

271
00:21:15,996 --> 00:21:17,788
Come on, guys, let's go!

272
00:21:17,957 --> 00:21:19,155
Yeah!

273
00:21:21,961 --> 00:21:23,539
Yeah...

274
00:21:23,713 --> 00:21:26,465
Yeah, yeah. Yeah...

275
00:22:46,052 --> 00:22:47,297
Mama?

276
00:22:52,767 --> 00:22:55,602
Mom? Dad? Is that you?

277
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:58,096
Mom! Dad!

278
00:22:59,983 --> 00:23:02,355
Oh, hi. Hey, son. You're back.

279
00:23:03,987 --> 00:23:05,814
Honey, what are you doing here?

280
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:07,021
But I thought...

281
00:23:07,199 --> 00:23:10,117
We replaced you, dear,
with this lovely radish.

282
00:23:11,204 --> 00:23:14,324
- Radish?
- It's quiet, polite, and, frankly,

283
00:23:14,499 --> 00:23:16,373
does better kung fu.

284
00:23:17,043 --> 00:23:18,751
No. No, no, no.

285
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:23,831
Wait!

286
00:23:30,057 --> 00:23:31,088
No.

287
00:23:39,651 --> 00:23:42,320
Radish, radish, radish, radish.

288
00:23:50,871 --> 00:23:52,698
Inner pea...

289
00:23:55,501 --> 00:23:56,580
Pea...

290
00:23:59,047 --> 00:24:00,624
Inner peace.

291
00:24:16,983 --> 00:24:21,811
Inner peace! Inner peace! Inner peace!
Inner peace! Inner peace...!

292
00:24:27,744 --> 00:24:29,737
I'm... training.

293
00:24:29,913 --> 00:24:32,202
The mast is not a worthy opponent.

294
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,245
- I am ready.
- OK.

295
00:24:38,422 --> 00:24:40,415
So serious.

296
00:24:48,141 --> 00:24:50,217
I think I prefer the mast.

297
00:24:50,393 --> 00:24:55,103
Apologies. I used to punch the
ironwood trees by the palace to train.

298
00:24:55,274 --> 00:24:56,602
Now I feel nothing.

299
00:24:57,610 --> 00:24:59,649
That's severely cool.

300
00:25:02,573 --> 00:25:03,605
Again!

301
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:10,532
So, this punching ironwood trees,
how long did you have to do that?

302
00:25:10,707 --> 00:25:13,459
- Twenty years.
- Oh, 20, 20 years.

303
00:25:14,378 --> 00:25:16,620
Is there any, you know, faster way?

304
00:25:16,797 --> 00:25:19,502
You know, until you, you know,
don't feel anything?

305
00:25:19,675 --> 00:25:21,632
No. Besides...

306
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,641
...I don't think
hard style is your thing.

307
00:25:33,148 --> 00:25:35,769
Po, why are you really out here?

308
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:40,480
I just found out that my dad
isn't really my dad.

309
00:25:42,575 --> 00:25:44,366
Your dad? The goose.

310
00:25:46,996 --> 00:25:49,238
That must have been quite a shock.

311
00:25:49,415 --> 00:25:50,791
Yeah.

312
00:25:50,959 --> 00:25:54,328
- And this bothers you?
- Are you kidding me?

313
00:25:54,504 --> 00:25:57,505
We're warriors, right?
Nerves of steel.

314
00:25:57,674 --> 00:25:59,631
Souls of platinum.

315
00:25:59,801 --> 00:26:01,000
Like you.

316
00:26:01,178 --> 00:26:03,135
So hard-core, you don't feel anything.

317
00:26:07,643 --> 00:26:09,683
- I was...
- So, what are you guys talking about?

318
00:26:10,605 --> 00:26:12,348
Nothing. Nothing.

319
00:26:12,523 --> 00:26:14,647
Po's having daddy issues.

320
00:26:14,818 --> 00:26:17,938
I'm so lucky.
I don't have any problems with my dad.

321
00:26:18,113 --> 00:26:20,485
Maybe it's because Mom
ate his head before I was born.

322
00:26:20,657 --> 00:26:23,492
- I don't know.
- Mantis, this isn't about you.

323
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,700
Po is the one freaking out.

324
00:26:25,871 --> 00:26:28,030
- I'm not freaking out.
- Po.

325
00:26:28,207 --> 00:26:30,413
- I'm freaking in.
- Po!

326
00:26:30,584 --> 00:26:33,254
- What?
- We're here.

327
00:26:33,421 --> 00:26:35,378
Gongmen City.

328
00:26:51,732 --> 00:26:54,270
My father's throne.

329
00:26:54,443 --> 00:26:57,480
He used to let me play here beside him,

330
00:26:57,655 --> 00:27:02,152
promising someday,
this throne would be mine.

331
00:27:06,999 --> 00:27:08,279
A little to the left.

332
00:27:08,459 --> 00:27:10,582
Oh, but it's so heavy, Master!

333
00:27:10,753 --> 00:27:14,038
Thirty years I've waited
for this moment.

334
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:17,714
Everything must be exactly
how I envisioned it.

335
00:27:17,885 --> 00:27:21,586
And I envisioned it
a little to the left.

336
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:23,796
Perfect!

337
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:27,179
With the weapon by my si...
A little bit more.

338
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:35,110
With the weapon by my side,
all of China will bow before me.

339
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:36,939
We move out in three days,

340
00:27:37,114 --> 00:27:40,947
when the moon is full
and the tide is high.

341
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:45,740
Now, you old goat,
why don't you tell me my...

342
00:27:45,915 --> 00:27:46,947
Fortune?

343
00:27:47,834 --> 00:27:50,835
Future. I was going to say future.

344
00:27:51,797 --> 00:27:55,380
Look into your bowl
and tell me what glory awaits.

345
00:27:57,094 --> 00:28:00,629
If you continue on your current path...

346
00:28:02,975 --> 00:28:06,973
...you will find yourself
at the bottom of the stairs.

347
00:28:09,608 --> 00:28:11,481
I see...

348
00:28:12,277 --> 00:28:14,270
I see...

349
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:18,482
I see pain... and anger.

350
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:21,660
How dare you!
That is the finest silk in the province!

351
00:28:21,829 --> 00:28:22,860
Followed by denial.

352
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:25,660
This is not fortune-telling.
You're just saying

353
00:28:25,833 --> 00:28:27,826
- what's happening right...
- Now?

354
00:28:29,504 --> 00:28:32,173
The most important time is now.

355
00:28:33,425 --> 00:28:35,833
But if you really want
to see the future...

356
00:28:38,722 --> 00:28:40,382
Oh, what do you see?

357
00:28:46,314 --> 00:28:48,141
A peacock...

358
00:28:49,442 --> 00:28:53,522
...is defeated by a warrior
of black and white.

359
00:28:54,739 --> 00:28:56,732
Nothing has changed.

360
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:05,828
That's impossible, and you know it.

361
00:29:06,002 --> 00:29:09,205
It is not impossible, and he knows it.

362
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,661
Who?

363
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,841
- Lord Shen! I saw a panda!
- A panda?

364
00:29:16,096 --> 00:29:18,385
A kung fu warrior.
It fought like a demon!

365
00:29:18,557 --> 00:29:20,181
Big and furry.

366
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:23,517
Soft and squishy.
Kind of plush and cuddly.

367
00:29:24,104 --> 00:29:27,308
There are no more pandas.

368
00:29:27,483 --> 00:29:30,817
Even with his poor eyesight,
he can see the truth.

369
00:29:30,987 --> 00:29:33,857
Why is it that you cannot?

370
00:29:34,782 --> 00:29:37,902
Find this panda and bring him to me!

371
00:29:38,078 --> 00:29:39,821
Yes, sir!

372
00:29:39,996 --> 00:29:43,829
One panda lives.
That does not make you right.

373
00:29:44,001 --> 00:29:47,833
You're right.
Being right makes me right.

374
00:29:48,422 --> 00:29:52,372
Then I will kill him and make you wrong.

375
00:29:54,387 --> 00:29:56,380
Will you stop that!

376
00:30:08,569 --> 00:30:11,653
That must be Shen's palace
on the other side of the city.

377
00:30:11,822 --> 00:30:14,360
Great. We'll march into the tower
and proclaim,

378
00:30:14,533 --> 00:30:16,573
"We are the Dragon Warrior
and the Furious Five,

379
00:30:16,744 --> 00:30:18,737
and we are here
to bring you to justice"!

380
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,835
What are you doing?
This place is crawling with wolves.

381
00:30:30,426 --> 00:30:32,917
Hey, isn't that the guy
who hammered you in the face?

382
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:37,968
I do not like that guy.

383
00:30:38,142 --> 00:30:41,761
We need to get to that tower
without being spotted by those wolves.

384
00:30:41,938 --> 00:30:44,429
Got it. Stealth mode.

385
00:31:07,882 --> 00:31:10,089
- Get out of the way!
- Foiled again.

386
00:31:12,137 --> 00:31:13,929
Now, where'd those noodles go?

387
00:31:20,187 --> 00:31:22,264
Hello. I couldn't help but...

388
00:31:23,065 --> 00:31:25,354
Yeah, OK. Anyway, where was I?

389
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:28,526
- Where's Po?
- How can we lose a guy that big?

390
00:31:32,409 --> 00:31:33,440
OK.

391
00:31:40,042 --> 00:31:41,951
Guys! Guys?

392
00:31:42,128 --> 00:31:43,836
- Hey, Po.
- What? Sorry.

393
00:31:44,005 --> 00:31:45,499
So that was stealth mode, huh?

394
00:31:45,673 --> 00:31:48,129
To be honest,
not one of my stronger modes.

395
00:31:48,301 --> 00:31:50,709
...gold in there, come on!

396
00:31:52,055 --> 00:31:53,335
This rice is raw!

397
00:31:53,515 --> 00:31:56,053
You stole all my metal pots
for Lord Shen!

398
00:31:56,226 --> 00:31:59,393
Either you cook my rice, or I cook you!

399
00:31:59,563 --> 00:32:02,315
- My apologies, but...
- Po, do something.

400
00:32:02,483 --> 00:32:04,974
How am I supposed to help her cook rice
without getting caught?

401
00:32:05,152 --> 00:32:07,192
- Wait, I have a better idea.
...two...

402
00:32:07,363 --> 00:32:08,561
...one.

403
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:10,364
- Hey.
- Hey.

404
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:24,078
We're here to liberate the city
and bring Shen to justice.

405
00:32:24,256 --> 00:32:25,964
- You will need help.
- Thank you, brave sheep,

406
00:32:26,133 --> 00:32:27,592
but it's too dangerous. I can't let you.

407
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,927
Oh, no, not me.
It's not safe to speak here.

408
00:32:31,097 --> 00:32:32,556
Right.

409
00:32:34,934 --> 00:32:37,426
I'm talking about Masters Ox and Croc.

410
00:32:37,604 --> 00:32:40,973
They're in Gongmen Jail
on Black Dragon Alley.

411
00:32:41,149 --> 00:32:42,774
What? They're still alive?

412
00:32:42,943 --> 00:32:44,936
They must be in that jail
gathering intelligence,

413
00:32:45,112 --> 00:32:47,817
hatching a plot to use their
awesomeness to defeat the weapon!

414
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:49,650
OK, let's go!

415
00:32:49,825 --> 00:32:52,910
- Thanks, sheep.
- Hey! Stop that costume!

416
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:54,359
- Hold it right there!
- Get them!

417
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:56,783
- Get them!
- Sorry!

418
00:32:57,625 --> 00:32:59,120
Take that!

419
00:32:59,294 --> 00:33:00,872
- Keep going!
- Faster!

420
00:33:01,922 --> 00:33:02,953
Hey, stop!

421
00:33:23,153 --> 00:33:25,146
- Look out! Watch it!
- Sorry!

422
00:33:25,322 --> 00:33:26,401
Surround him.

423
00:33:28,826 --> 00:33:30,320
Now!

424
00:33:30,494 --> 00:33:32,238
Gotcha!

425
00:33:33,289 --> 00:33:34,534
What? Where'd he go?

426
00:33:34,707 --> 00:33:37,494
- Spread out! Search everywhere!
- What about over there?

427
00:33:37,668 --> 00:33:41,619
- Is "there" a part of "everywhere"?
- I... I guess.

428
00:33:41,798 --> 00:33:43,257
Then search there!

429
00:33:48,263 --> 00:33:51,679
They must be close. I can feel
a kung fu chill riding up my spine.

430
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:53,843
Sorry, Po. It's just me.

431
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:57,013
Look. Gongmen Jail.

432
00:34:00,651 --> 00:34:02,443
Aw, it's cute.

433
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:04,905
Cute, huh?

434
00:34:14,166 --> 00:34:15,744
Nice work, Po.

435
00:34:17,211 --> 00:34:19,833
At the first sign of trouble,
I'll give you a signal.

436
00:34:21,382 --> 00:34:23,174
- You mean like Crane does?
- Yeah.

437
00:34:23,343 --> 00:34:25,715
Excuse me,
when have I ever made that noise?

438
00:34:26,554 --> 00:34:28,843
Master Ox! Master!

439
00:34:31,143 --> 00:34:32,553
The ferocious Master Croc!

440
00:34:34,521 --> 00:34:36,894
And Master Storming Ox.

441
00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:40,729
I can't believe we're rescuing
actual legends of kung fu.

442
00:34:40,903 --> 00:34:42,896
We're gonna free you from those
bonds of injustice. No problem.

443
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:45,694
Gotta be a key around here. No,
they wouldn't leave a key around here.

444
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:49,953
Oh, good! You found it.
Come on, you guys! Yeah!

445
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:52,114
We're coming for you, Shen!

446
00:34:57,713 --> 00:35:00,833
Guys, are we going or not?
Do you want to meet us there later?

447
00:35:01,008 --> 00:35:02,752
I mean, you do want to
take back your city, right?

448
00:35:02,927 --> 00:35:04,635
Of course we do.

449
00:35:04,804 --> 00:35:08,636
But if we stand up to Shen,
he will turn the weapon on the city.

450
00:35:08,808 --> 00:35:10,600
Listen to yourself.
You're protecting Gongmen City

451
00:35:10,769 --> 00:35:12,560
by not protecting Gongmen City?

452
00:35:12,729 --> 00:35:17,356
- If we all fight together...
- Then the weapon would kill everyone.

453
00:35:17,526 --> 00:35:21,275
Oh, would it?
Then we use... a sneak attack!

454
00:35:21,447 --> 00:35:24,020
- We get inside and then...
- And then you will be stopped...

455
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,780
...by the unstoppable weapon.

456
00:35:28,955 --> 00:35:31,280
Nothing's unstoppable except for me
when I'm stopping you

457
00:35:31,457 --> 00:35:33,949
from telling me
something's unstoppable!

458
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:47,182
Master Ox,
I'm not letting you stay in this cell.

459
00:35:47,349 --> 00:35:49,223
I'd like to see you get me out!

460
00:35:54,816 --> 00:35:57,188
You guys see that?
It's called being awesome.

461
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,234
Come on! Whatever
happened to being heroes?

462
00:35:59,404 --> 00:36:02,156
The only hero in this town
is a dead one!

463
00:36:06,745 --> 00:36:10,446
Like I said, you are not
getting me out of this cell!

464
00:36:13,211 --> 00:36:14,919
Yes!

465
00:36:15,088 --> 00:36:17,080
All right, let's go!

466
00:36:17,924 --> 00:36:19,169
I get the top bunk.

467
00:36:21,344 --> 00:36:25,508
It's time to surrender, panda.
Kung fu is dead.

468
00:36:25,682 --> 00:36:27,177
I...

469
00:36:30,312 --> 00:36:31,392
You...

470
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:34,731
Kung fu is dead? Fine!

471
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:38,352
You stay in your prison of fear
with bars made of hopelessness.

472
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:41,733
And all you get are three
square meals a day of shame!

473
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:43,533
With despair for dessert.

474
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:46,869
We'll take on Shen and prove
to all those who are hungry

475
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:50,953
for justice and honour
that kung fu still lives!

476
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:52,502
Yeah!

477
00:36:55,631 --> 00:36:56,746
Monkey?!

478
00:36:58,301 --> 00:36:59,629
You! You're mine!

479
00:36:59,802 --> 00:37:01,760
I'll tell you what's gonna be yours!

480
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:04,847
My fist in your plush, cuddly,
super-soft face!

481
00:37:07,477 --> 00:37:08,888
Get him!

482
00:37:09,438 --> 00:37:11,146
- Get me out of here!
- Yes, sir!

483
00:37:11,982 --> 00:37:13,358
Stop him!

484
00:37:16,362 --> 00:37:17,642
Faster!

485
00:37:20,742 --> 00:37:23,233
Yeah! Go, go!

486
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:25,910
- Lose him!
- Yes, sir!

487
00:37:27,916 --> 00:37:29,909
- Viper!
- Hang on!

488
00:37:39,345 --> 00:37:42,097
- What?
- Watch out!

489
00:37:44,684 --> 00:37:46,760
Uncool! Very uncool!

490
00:37:47,145 --> 00:37:48,853
Try this!

491
00:37:50,106 --> 00:37:51,269
Guys, guys, guys!

492
00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:58,108
Maybe something smaller!

493
00:37:58,657 --> 00:38:00,780
No, no! Oh, no, no.

494
00:38:05,331 --> 00:38:08,083
Cute bunnies, off the face.
Excuse me! OK, pardon me!

495
00:38:17,719 --> 00:38:19,428
Fire!

496
00:38:20,097 --> 00:38:21,639
We've lost them.

497
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:32,607
Again! Again!

498
00:38:33,737 --> 00:38:34,982
Crane, catch!

499
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:39,481
Gotcha!

500
00:38:48,794 --> 00:38:50,787
Guys, guys, guys, guys,
give me a shove!

501
00:38:51,547 --> 00:38:53,505
Mantis, now!

502
00:39:06,939 --> 00:39:10,771
Is that all you got? It feels like
I'm fighting a big old fluffy cloud!

503
00:39:10,943 --> 00:39:13,185
Well, this cloud is about
to bring the thunder!

504
00:39:16,407 --> 00:39:17,522
Your turn!

505
00:39:19,661 --> 00:39:23,196
Why... are... there...
so... many... signs?!

506
00:39:39,015 --> 00:39:41,341
Come here! Alaka-squasho!

507
00:39:42,644 --> 00:39:46,013
Yes! Taste the defeat!

508
00:39:46,189 --> 00:39:47,565
Let me tell you something.

509
00:39:47,733 --> 00:39:50,734
Next time you mess with a panda,
you better bring a whole a...

510
00:40:00,538 --> 00:40:02,330
Guess nobody told you,

511
00:40:02,499 --> 00:40:05,416
if you mess with the wolf,
you get the fangs.

512
00:40:05,919 --> 00:40:09,787
I've hit you twice.
What are you going to do now?

513
00:40:12,718 --> 00:40:14,627
We surrender!

514
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:22,394
You can chain my body, but you will
never chain my... warrior spirit.

515
00:40:22,562 --> 00:40:25,053
- Hey, don't forget the little guy.
- Did you just call...?

516
00:40:25,231 --> 00:40:28,398
- Po, what are you doing?
- Trust me. I got a pl...

517
00:40:29,945 --> 00:40:32,946
No way. Eight-point acupressure cuffs?

518
00:40:33,115 --> 00:40:36,365
Just like the ones that held Tai Lung.
The more you move, the tighter they get.

519
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:39,278
These are the best cuffs!

520
00:40:41,791 --> 00:40:44,460
Greetings, panda. At last we meet!

521
00:40:45,837 --> 00:40:47,664
No, no, no...

522
00:40:50,967 --> 00:40:54,965
We meet at last! Yes, that's it.

523
00:40:55,139 --> 00:40:57,630
Greetings, panda. We meet at...

524
00:40:59,143 --> 00:41:02,892
- You are afraid for a reason.
- I am not afraid.

525
00:41:03,064 --> 00:41:05,816
He is coming to me in chains.

526
00:41:05,984 --> 00:41:08,475
- If anyone should be afraid, it's...
- You.

527
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:13,982
Don't even think about it.

528
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:30,092
I hope this turns out better than
your plan to cook rice in your stomach

529
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:32,585
by eating it raw
and then drinking boiling water.

530
00:41:32,762 --> 00:41:34,839
This plan's nothing like that plan.

531
00:41:35,015 --> 00:41:37,138
- How?
- 'Cause this one's going to work.

532
00:41:49,697 --> 00:41:51,690
Keep moving.

533
00:41:57,372 --> 00:41:59,946
Ah, my old enemy...

534
00:42:04,463 --> 00:42:06,539
...stairs.

535
00:42:34,871 --> 00:42:38,074
Thanks for carrying me
those last few flights. OK.

536
00:42:38,249 --> 00:42:40,657
I threw up a little bit
on the third floor.

537
00:42:40,836 --> 00:42:42,246
Someone might want to clean that up.

538
00:42:42,421 --> 00:42:45,090
Is there some sort of evil janitor
or something?

539
00:42:45,257 --> 00:42:46,835
Greetings, panda.

540
00:42:47,009 --> 00:42:49,334
- We meet at...
- Hey, how you doing?

541
00:42:51,055 --> 00:42:52,466
Hey.

542
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:55,641
You've grown up bigger than I thought.

543
00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:58,515
Hey... enough with the poking around.

544
00:42:58,688 --> 00:43:01,440
Strong. Healthy.

545
00:43:01,608 --> 00:43:04,277
Look, I don't know who you are,
but please stand aside, sir.

546
00:43:04,444 --> 00:43:06,900
- That's a lady.
- Oh! Sorry.

547
00:43:07,072 --> 00:43:09,777
The beard threw me.
It's kind of misleading.

548
00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:13,035
- False advertising.
- Enough of this nonsense!

549
00:43:13,204 --> 00:43:14,864
Bring the prisoners to me.

550
00:43:15,039 --> 00:43:16,664
Sorry, ma'am. Get ready, guys.

551
00:43:16,833 --> 00:43:19,371
Keep your eyes peeled for the...
weapon!

552
00:43:23,798 --> 00:43:24,997
Sparrow kick!

553
00:43:27,052 --> 00:43:30,219
We did it! I just kung fu-ed it!
Did you guys see that? I was all like...

554
00:43:39,398 --> 00:43:42,649
Do you actually believe this is
the warrior destined to defeat me?

555
00:43:42,819 --> 00:43:45,986
I do not. I know he is.

556
00:43:47,282 --> 00:43:50,734
Oh, look at him.
A lifetime to plot his revenge

557
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:54,410
- and he comes to me on his knees.
- What? A lifetime?

558
00:43:54,581 --> 00:43:55,827
I did not have a lifetime.

559
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,957
We only heard about Master Rhino
a few days ago,

560
00:43:58,127 --> 00:44:02,836
- and we came to avenge him!
- You've come to avenge nothing else?

561
00:44:03,007 --> 00:44:05,498
Well, yeah.
All the pots and pans that you stole.

562
00:44:05,677 --> 00:44:08,084
- I'm gonna want those back.
- Nothing else?

563
00:44:08,263 --> 00:44:10,836
You probably did some other evil stuff
along the way. I don't know.

564
00:44:11,016 --> 00:44:13,139
- What else did you do?
- You don't know?

565
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:15,552
Know what? What's so funny?

566
00:44:15,729 --> 00:44:18,849
The very thing
that you clearly do not know!

567
00:44:19,024 --> 00:44:22,939
OK, enough of these riddles!
Would you guys spill the beans?

568
00:44:23,112 --> 00:44:26,446
First, we come in and the weapon
is tiny. Surprise, it's big.

569
00:44:26,616 --> 00:44:29,617
And then the lady over here,
I think it's a guy, 'cause he's got...

570
00:44:30,954 --> 00:44:33,492
The only reason you are still alive

571
00:44:33,665 --> 00:44:38,458
is that I find your stupidity
mildly amusing.

572
00:44:38,629 --> 00:44:41,963
Well, thank you. But I find your
evilness extremely annoying.

573
00:44:42,133 --> 00:44:44,006
Who do you think you are, panda?

574
00:44:44,176 --> 00:44:46,881
Who do you think I am, peacock?

575
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:57,639
Why are we laughing?

576
00:44:58,692 --> 00:44:59,855
Take aim.

577
00:45:11,539 --> 00:45:12,950
Fire.

578
00:45:17,087 --> 00:45:19,792
Well, light the... thing!

579
00:45:19,965 --> 00:45:21,590
I did!

580
00:45:26,347 --> 00:45:28,221
Fear the bug!

581
00:45:37,275 --> 00:45:38,734
Get the weapon!

582
00:45:40,737 --> 00:45:42,611
Tigress!

583
00:46:15,441 --> 00:46:16,852
You... You were there.

584
00:46:17,026 --> 00:46:19,980
Yes. Yes, I was.

585
00:46:27,829 --> 00:46:30,996
- You just let Shen get away!
- At least we destroyed the weapon.

586
00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:37,040
Fire!

587
00:46:40,009 --> 00:46:41,836
Oh. No, he's got way more.

588
00:46:48,185 --> 00:46:49,560
- My wing!
- Help, Po!

589
00:46:49,728 --> 00:46:51,139
Coming!

590
00:46:52,022 --> 00:46:54,430
- Watch out!
- Po!

591
00:46:57,737 --> 00:47:00,607
- Help me up!
- No. Get him down.

592
00:47:00,782 --> 00:47:02,324
Use the ropes.

593
00:47:11,209 --> 00:47:13,286
Run, run, little panda!

594
00:47:24,557 --> 00:47:27,642
- Po, come on. We need you to focus!
- I got it, I got it!

595
00:47:27,811 --> 00:47:29,435
Bring it down!

596
00:47:32,899 --> 00:47:35,188
- We're trapped!
- This way!

597
00:47:39,573 --> 00:47:41,068
Goodbye!

598
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:45,448
Fire!

599
00:47:46,914 --> 00:47:48,325
Get back!

600
00:47:56,383 --> 00:47:58,376
The only way out is up.

601
00:47:59,094 --> 00:48:00,505
What?

602
00:48:11,524 --> 00:48:13,980
Follow me! Come on!

603
00:48:14,569 --> 00:48:15,898
Where are they going?

604
00:48:16,071 --> 00:48:18,906
- To the top!
- Come on! Keep going!

605
00:48:26,165 --> 00:48:27,707
Here we go!

606
00:48:46,395 --> 00:48:49,729
- You idiot!
- My nose!

607
00:48:49,899 --> 00:48:54,312
Call in the wolves! All of them!
I want them ready to move!

608
00:48:54,487 --> 00:48:58,106
The Year of the Peacock begins now!

609
00:48:58,283 --> 00:49:01,154
Right now?
'Cause it's the middle of the year,

610
00:49:01,328 --> 00:49:03,997
so you'd only get like
a half of the Year of the Peacock.

611
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:08,911
And this is the Year, of course,
of the Peacock.

612
00:49:09,086 --> 00:49:11,079
Happy New Year, sir.

613
00:49:14,926 --> 00:49:19,173
Get the wolves ready.
We're loading the ships now.

614
00:49:19,347 --> 00:49:20,426
Now!

615
00:49:20,598 --> 00:49:22,508
Now, now, now, now, now!

616
00:49:22,684 --> 00:49:25,471
Move! Move, move, move, move!

617
00:49:41,871 --> 00:49:43,496
This way.

618
00:49:47,878 --> 00:49:49,705
Let's go.

619
00:49:55,052 --> 00:49:55,966
Oh, you!

620
00:49:56,303 --> 00:49:58,380
What did you do?
It's chaos up there.

621
00:49:58,556 --> 00:50:00,216
What happened to stopping Shen?

622
00:50:01,684 --> 00:50:03,309
Yeah.

623
00:50:04,729 --> 00:50:06,888
Guys, come on.
Give me a little credit.

624
00:50:07,065 --> 00:50:09,188
I meant for him to get away.

625
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:12,313
'Cause... it was a trick. It was a plot.

626
00:50:12,488 --> 00:50:17,399
I was thinking...
I'll figure out his plot more.

627
00:50:18,077 --> 00:50:20,070
That makes no sense.

628
00:50:20,246 --> 00:50:21,906
What do you mean? Sure it does.

629
00:50:22,081 --> 00:50:25,415
Po, the truth.
You had Shen. What happened?

630
00:50:25,585 --> 00:50:27,625
What are you talking about?
I don't know what you're talking about.

631
00:50:27,796 --> 00:50:30,334
I... Yeah...
OK, he caught me off guard.

632
00:50:31,049 --> 00:50:32,294
The truth.

633
00:50:35,679 --> 00:50:39,428
Fine. They will keep you
far from danger.

634
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:42,138
- Real far.
- What?

635
00:50:42,311 --> 00:50:44,434
You're staying here.

636
00:50:44,939 --> 00:50:47,347
Wait! I have to go ba...

637
00:50:52,739 --> 00:50:54,566
You're staying here!

638
00:50:55,117 --> 00:50:57,275
I'm going. And you can't stop me.

639
00:51:00,581 --> 00:51:02,823
OK. I wasn't ready that time.

640
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,708
Guys? Don't.

641
00:51:04,877 --> 00:51:05,956
Ready.

642
00:51:06,587 --> 00:51:07,619
Look!

643
00:51:20,185 --> 00:51:21,561
Stay down.

644
00:51:23,189 --> 00:51:26,273
- I have to get to him.
- Then tell me why!

645
00:51:28,653 --> 00:51:30,978
He was there! OK?

646
00:51:31,155 --> 00:51:34,359
The peacock was there
the last time I saw my parents.

647
00:51:34,534 --> 00:51:38,153
He knows what happened.
Where I came from.

648
00:51:38,330 --> 00:51:40,786
Who I am.

649
00:51:44,336 --> 00:51:46,459
Look, I'm going.

650
00:51:47,089 --> 00:51:49,497
I have to know.

651
00:51:49,675 --> 00:51:51,715
The hard core can't understand.

652
00:51:51,886 --> 00:51:53,594
Tigress, no!

653
00:51:57,767 --> 00:51:59,760
The hard core do understand.

654
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:04,101
But I can't watch my friend be killed.

655
00:52:05,526 --> 00:52:09,606
- We're going.
- Maybe you can't watch me be killed?

656
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:12,698
- Stop being a wimp.
- And she's back.

657
00:52:14,369 --> 00:52:16,527
- No.
- Don't worry, kid.

658
00:52:16,704 --> 00:52:18,496
You're better off here.

659
00:52:28,050 --> 00:52:32,546
You were wrong, Soothsayer.
We sail to victory tonight.

660
00:52:33,389 --> 00:52:35,714
Your magic panda is clearly a fool.

661
00:52:35,892 --> 00:52:38,846
Are you certain it is the panda
who is a fool?

662
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:41,392
You just destroyed
your ancestral home, Shen.

663
00:52:41,564 --> 00:52:46,903
A trivial sacrifice...
when all of China is my reward.

664
00:52:47,070 --> 00:52:49,526
Then will you finally be satisfied?

665
00:52:49,698 --> 00:52:53,910
Will the subjugation of the whole world
finally make you feel better?

666
00:52:54,453 --> 00:52:58,451
It's a start. I might also convert
the basement into a dungeon.

667
00:53:01,377 --> 00:53:04,082
The cup you choose to fill
has no bottom.

668
00:53:04,255 --> 00:53:07,257
It is time to stop this madness.

669
00:53:08,301 --> 00:53:10,211
Why on earth would I do that?

670
00:53:10,387 --> 00:53:12,594
So your parents can rest in peace.

671
00:53:13,432 --> 00:53:16,386
My parents hated me.

672
00:53:17,603 --> 00:53:20,474
Do you understand?

673
00:53:20,648 --> 00:53:26,023
They wronged me...
and I will make it right.

674
00:53:26,196 --> 00:53:27,476
They loved you.

675
00:53:27,656 --> 00:53:32,401
They loved you so much that
having to send you away killed them.

676
00:53:34,997 --> 00:53:40,786
The dead exist in the past...
and I must tend to the future.

677
00:53:45,633 --> 00:53:49,678
Set the soothsayer free.
She's no use to me.

678
00:53:49,846 --> 00:53:53,465
Goodbye, Shen.
I wish you happiness.

679
00:53:53,642 --> 00:53:56,347
Happiness must be taken.

680
00:53:57,980 --> 00:54:00,352
And I will take mine.

681
00:54:22,256 --> 00:54:25,008
- Hurry it up!
- Move it!

682
00:54:26,135 --> 00:54:29,255
If all of those weapons
leave the building, China will fall.

683
00:54:29,430 --> 00:54:33,725
- We bring down the building.
- Hey, guys. How about this?

684
00:54:36,354 --> 00:54:38,513
- This will work!
- All right, let's go.

685
00:54:38,690 --> 00:54:40,185
I can't feel my face.

686
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:58,621
Did you hear him call it
Year of the Peacock?

687
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:01,037
- Hey.
- Hey.

688
00:55:01,215 --> 00:55:02,757
OK. So, keep it cool.
Keep it cool. Keep it cool.

689
00:55:02,925 --> 00:55:05,332
You! Where are you going?

690
00:55:07,430 --> 00:55:10,881
On your feet! And wipe those
stupid grins off your faces.

691
00:55:24,323 --> 00:55:28,107
Move, you dogs!
Faster, faster! Load them all!

692
00:55:38,421 --> 00:55:40,414
Greetings, panda.

693
00:55:44,010 --> 00:55:47,012
- Tell me what happened that night.
- What night?

694
00:55:47,181 --> 00:55:50,182
- That night.
- Ah, that night.

695
00:55:50,351 --> 00:55:53,352
Yes! We're talking
about the same night, right?

696
00:55:54,272 --> 00:55:58,056
Yes, I was there. Yes. I watched
as your parents abandoned you.

697
00:55:58,234 --> 00:56:02,813
It's a terrible thing.
I believe it went something like this.

698
00:56:12,958 --> 00:56:14,417
Here's your New Year's gift.

699
00:56:14,585 --> 00:56:16,744
Hope you like it,
'cause you can't return it.

700
00:56:18,631 --> 00:56:21,003
Po? What's he doing here?

701
00:56:21,926 --> 00:56:23,171
Return it! Return it!

702
00:56:35,232 --> 00:56:37,770
Are you willing to die
to find the truth?

703
00:56:37,943 --> 00:56:41,526
You bet I am.
Although I'd prefer not to.

704
00:57:04,305 --> 00:57:06,013
We got them. Go!

705
00:57:27,747 --> 00:57:29,241
You looking for me?

706
00:57:36,256 --> 00:57:38,048
I said that too soon, didn't I?

707
00:57:46,475 --> 00:57:47,638
Po!

708
00:57:52,398 --> 00:57:53,941
Po, get away from him.

709
00:57:54,109 --> 00:57:56,066
I'll get up. Here we go.

710
00:57:58,864 --> 00:58:01,533
- No more running, Shen.
- So it seems.

711
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:03,693
Now... answers.

712
00:58:03,869 --> 00:58:06,621
Oh, you want to know so badly.

713
00:58:07,248 --> 00:58:10,451
You think knowing will heal you, huh?

714
00:58:10,626 --> 00:58:14,671
Fill some crater in your soul?

715
00:58:14,839 --> 00:58:16,998
Well, here's your answer.

716
00:58:17,175 --> 00:58:20,260
Your parents didn't love you.

717
00:58:21,305 --> 00:58:23,178
But here...

718
00:58:23,348 --> 00:58:26,018
...let me heal you!

719
00:58:32,024 --> 00:58:33,816
No!

720
00:59:48,398 --> 00:59:50,889
Yeah, like you could make me drink that.

721
00:59:55,155 --> 00:59:59,403
If I wanted you dead,
I would have left you in that river.

722
00:59:59,577 --> 01:00:03,527
- Well, why save me?
- So you can fulfil your destiny.

723
01:00:03,706 --> 01:00:06,910
What are you talking about?
Where am I?

724
01:00:09,212 --> 01:00:10,754
What is this place?

725
01:00:10,922 --> 01:00:14,920
I'm surprised you remember so little.

726
01:00:15,093 --> 01:00:18,545
But you were so little when it happened.

727
01:00:23,853 --> 01:00:26,391
Perhaps you do remember.

728
01:00:26,564 --> 01:00:28,557
What? It's just a stupid nightmare.

729
01:00:28,733 --> 01:00:30,809
Nightmare? Or memory?

730
01:01:01,769 --> 01:01:04,390
This was a thriving village.

731
01:01:04,563 --> 01:01:08,098
Young Shen was in line
to rule Gongmen City.

732
01:01:08,276 --> 01:01:10,103
But he wanted more.

733
01:01:10,278 --> 01:01:16,032
I foretold that someone would stand
in his way. A panda.

734
01:01:16,201 --> 01:01:20,151
But I never could have foretold
what came next.

735
01:01:33,344 --> 01:01:34,755
Get them all!

736
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:44,806
Take our son and run away! Go!

737
01:01:58,371 --> 01:02:01,990
Stop fighting. Let it flow.

738
01:04:05,925 --> 01:04:10,005
Your story may not have
such a happy beginning,

739
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:13,299
but that doesn't
make you who you are.

740
01:04:13,475 --> 01:04:16,013
It is the rest of your story.

741
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:19,012
Who you choose to be.

742
01:04:51,182 --> 01:04:54,551
So, who are you, panda?

743
01:05:02,819 --> 01:05:04,230
I am Po.

744
01:05:06,031 --> 01:05:07,988
And I'm gonna need a hat.

745
01:05:17,418 --> 01:05:20,373
Such sad, sad faces.

746
01:05:20,964 --> 01:05:23,253
But now is a time only for joy.

747
01:05:23,425 --> 01:05:27,470
You are going to be part
of something beautiful.

748
01:05:29,723 --> 01:05:33,721
Once we reach the harbour,
in front of all the world,

749
01:05:33,894 --> 01:05:38,058
you and your precious kung fu will die.

750
01:05:40,235 --> 01:05:45,146
Then China will know to bow before me.

751
01:05:45,323 --> 01:05:46,983
Set sail!

752
01:05:58,254 --> 01:05:59,665
What is that?

753
01:06:20,152 --> 01:06:23,319
Honestly, guys,
I never thought I'd die like this.

754
01:06:23,489 --> 01:06:26,491
I always thought I'd meet
a nice girl and settle down and...

755
01:06:26,659 --> 01:06:28,403
...then she'd eat my head.

756
01:06:28,578 --> 01:06:30,986
- So sad.
- We cannot give up hope.

757
01:06:31,164 --> 01:06:35,708
Po would want us to remain strong.
Hard-core. Right, Tigress?

758
01:06:43,678 --> 01:06:47,628
- Lord Shen, what about the bridge?
- Nothing stands in my way.

759
01:06:48,349 --> 01:06:49,548
Fire!

760
01:06:58,819 --> 01:07:00,646
You coward!

761
01:07:10,582 --> 01:07:11,661
Po?

762
01:07:14,085 --> 01:07:15,117
Po?

763
01:07:17,214 --> 01:07:22,339
How many times do I have to kill
the same stinking panda?

764
01:07:31,938 --> 01:07:33,349
Shen!

765
01:07:33,523 --> 01:07:37,568
A panda stands between you
and your destiny.

766
01:07:38,278 --> 01:07:39,309
What?

767
01:07:39,488 --> 01:07:43,486
Prepare yourself for a
hot serving of justice.

768
01:07:43,659 --> 01:07:45,319
Your reign of terror comes to an end.

769
01:07:45,494 --> 01:07:48,745
- What?
- And now, free the Five!

770
01:07:48,915 --> 01:07:50,991
Disc of Destruction!

771
01:08:02,095 --> 01:08:05,013
OK. Take aim!

772
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:17,944
Ready?

773
01:08:38,885 --> 01:08:40,842
You can't follow me.

774
01:08:41,012 --> 01:08:42,091
Just get him!

775
01:08:47,394 --> 01:08:49,138
- Yeah. Here we go.
- Come on!

776
01:08:56,404 --> 01:08:57,779
- No, no, no, don't shoot!
- Don't shoot!

777
01:08:57,947 --> 01:08:58,978
No, don't shoot!

778
01:08:59,157 --> 01:09:01,564
- Don't shoot!
- Don't shoot!

779
01:09:01,743 --> 01:09:04,151
- You don't shoot!
- I won't shoot if you won't shoot.

780
01:09:06,540 --> 01:09:07,571
Yeah!

781
01:09:07,749 --> 01:09:10,620
- Don't shoot! Cross fire!
- Attack!

782
01:09:16,801 --> 01:09:19,256
- Catch of Freedom!
- Monkey!

783
01:09:24,601 --> 01:09:26,807
Impressive, Dragon Warrior.
What's your plan?

784
01:09:26,978 --> 01:09:29,137
- Step one, free the Five.
- What's step two?

785
01:09:29,314 --> 01:09:31,058
Honestly, I didn't think
I'd make it this far.

786
01:09:31,233 --> 01:09:32,264
Po!

787
01:09:32,442 --> 01:09:34,566
Stop Shen before he gets to the harbour.

788
01:09:40,117 --> 01:09:41,149
Nice!

789
01:09:43,746 --> 01:09:45,075
Viper, Puppet of Death!

790
01:09:45,790 --> 01:09:46,821
Tigress!

791
01:09:55,509 --> 01:09:57,502
- Master Ox!
- Jump!

792
01:09:57,678 --> 01:10:00,169
- And Croc!
- Vengeance is served.

793
01:10:00,347 --> 01:10:03,183
- Why did you...?
- Your friend there is very persuasive.

794
01:10:10,817 --> 01:10:12,015
Master Shifu!

795
01:10:14,362 --> 01:10:16,688
Quickly. Use their boats
to block the way.

796
01:10:27,502 --> 01:10:28,533
Crane!

797
01:10:29,504 --> 01:10:31,413
Wings of Justice!

798
01:10:33,508 --> 01:10:34,706
Yeah!

799
01:10:40,849 --> 01:10:41,881
What?

800
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:55,983
I love you guys.

801
01:11:04,917 --> 01:11:06,577
Why aren't we firing?

802
01:11:06,752 --> 01:11:10,168
They're taking out our gunners, sir.
They're getting close.

803
01:11:11,966 --> 01:11:14,920
Fire! Fire at them!

804
01:11:15,595 --> 01:11:19,178
- But, sir, we'll kill our own.
- I said fire at them!

805
01:11:19,349 --> 01:11:20,380
Fire!

806
01:11:23,020 --> 01:11:24,051
No.

807
01:11:31,696 --> 01:11:32,976
Po!

808
01:12:08,569 --> 01:12:09,683
Tigress?

809
01:12:59,540 --> 01:13:01,248
As you wish.

810
01:13:01,417 --> 01:13:03,042
Let's finish this.

811
01:13:26,736 --> 01:13:27,934
Fire!

812
01:13:32,993 --> 01:13:34,820
<i>Inner peace.</i>

813
01:14:02,274 --> 01:14:03,305
Again!

814
01:14:10,616 --> 01:14:11,648
Yeah!

815
01:14:12,952 --> 01:14:15,906
Kill him! Somebody kill him!

816
01:14:38,104 --> 01:14:40,512
What? No. No!

817
01:14:47,156 --> 01:14:50,157
Keep firing! Keep firing!

818
01:15:10,806 --> 01:15:12,300
Skadoosh.

819
01:15:42,549 --> 01:15:43,877
How did you...?

820
01:15:45,301 --> 01:15:46,926
How did you do it?

821
01:15:50,766 --> 01:15:53,387
You know, you just keep your elbows up
and keep the shoulders loose.

822
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:56,727
Not that. How did you find peace?

823
01:15:56,897 --> 01:16:00,563
I took away your parents. Everything.

824
01:16:00,735 --> 01:16:03,107
I scarred you for life.

825
01:16:03,738 --> 01:16:07,238
See, that's the thing, Shen.
Scars heal.

826
01:16:07,409 --> 01:16:11,407
No, they don't. Wounds heal.

827
01:16:11,580 --> 01:16:13,988
Oh, yeah. What do scars do?
They fade, I guess?

828
01:16:14,166 --> 01:16:18,579
- I don't care what scars do.
- You should, Shen.

829
01:16:18,754 --> 01:16:22,669
You gotta let go of that stuff from
the past, 'cause it just doesn't matter.

830
01:16:22,842 --> 01:16:27,338
The only thing that matters
is what you choose to be now.

831
01:16:27,514 --> 01:16:28,924
You're right.

832
01:16:29,099 --> 01:16:31,471
Then I choose... this!

833
01:17:24,283 --> 01:17:26,489
That was pretty hard-core.

834
01:17:35,837 --> 01:17:36,916
- Po!
- You did it!

835
01:17:37,088 --> 01:17:40,173
- Come here! Yeah!
- Don't ever do that again, please.

836
01:17:40,342 --> 01:17:44,007
It seems you have found inner peace.

837
01:17:44,179 --> 01:17:46,505
And at such a young age.

838
01:17:46,682 --> 01:17:48,556
Well, I had a pretty good teacher.

839
01:18:09,540 --> 01:18:13,205
What do you mean he's not here?
It's my son's birthday.

840
01:18:13,377 --> 01:18:15,750
All he wanted was to meet
the Dragon Warrior.

841
01:18:15,922 --> 01:18:18,674
How about some tofu birthday cake
instead, huh?

842
01:18:18,841 --> 01:18:21,677
You know, I think we'll
just try again another time.

843
01:18:21,845 --> 01:18:23,220
When do you think he'll be back?

844
01:18:26,183 --> 01:18:30,181
I don't know. OK, I don't know.
Maybe never.

845
01:18:30,354 --> 01:18:33,688
I mean, I worry, OK?
But that's my job, I'm his dad.

846
01:18:33,858 --> 01:18:36,064
At least, I was his dad.

847
01:18:36,235 --> 01:18:39,854
Why did he have to go and save China?
I know why.

848
01:18:40,031 --> 01:18:43,732
But why? He's just one little panda.

849
01:18:59,260 --> 01:19:03,044
So, how did it go?
Did you save China?

850
01:19:04,057 --> 01:19:05,432
Yep.

851
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:07,889
Well, I knew you would.

852
01:19:08,061 --> 01:19:09,805
That's why I had new signs made.

853
01:19:09,980 --> 01:19:12,222
"My son saved China.
You, too, can save.

854
01:19:12,399 --> 01:19:14,890
Buy one dumpling, get one free."

855
01:19:15,069 --> 01:19:16,444
Hey, that's a pretty good deal.

856
01:19:16,612 --> 01:19:19,281
- Would you like to try one?
- Maybe later.

857
01:19:22,076 --> 01:19:24,152
There's something I should tell you.

858
01:19:26,956 --> 01:19:31,369
While I was gone,
I found the village where I was born.

859
01:19:33,088 --> 01:19:36,457
I found out how I ended up
in that radish basket.

860
01:19:36,633 --> 01:19:38,258
You did?

861
01:19:39,094 --> 01:19:43,009
- I know who I am.
- You do?

862
01:19:45,017 --> 01:19:46,642
I'm your son.

863
01:19:52,776 --> 01:19:54,400
I love you, Dad.

864
01:19:55,445 --> 01:19:57,319
I love you, too, son.

865
01:20:01,368 --> 01:20:03,408
Delicious, fat radishes!

866
01:20:03,579 --> 01:20:05,702
You're probably hungry.
Let me make you something to eat.

867
01:20:05,873 --> 01:20:07,617
What are you talking about? I'll cook.

868
01:20:07,792 --> 01:20:09,203
- No, no, I'll cook.
- Dad!

869
01:20:09,377 --> 01:20:11,500
Well, it's the least I can do.
You saved China.

870
01:20:11,671 --> 01:20:13,960
No, it's the least I can do.
You raised me.

871
01:20:14,132 --> 01:20:15,163
- Po.
- Dad.

872
01:20:15,342 --> 01:20:16,801
- Po!
- OK.

873
01:20:16,968 --> 01:20:19,590
Let's both cook. Together.

874
01:20:19,763 --> 01:20:21,044
Together.

875
01:20:21,223 --> 01:20:22,801
No, I'll cook.

876
01:20:57,721 --> 01:21:00,128
My son is alive.

877
01:21:01,305 --> 01:22:01,650
