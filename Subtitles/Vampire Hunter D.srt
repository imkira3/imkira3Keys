2
00:02:29,783 --> 00:02:30,647
Luke!!!

3
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:19,491
Oh my God!

4
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:20,655
Luke no!!!

5
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:38,949
Luke!!

6
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:41,718
Luke!!!

7
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,192
A werewolf!

8
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:25,965
One of the nobles!

9
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:22,493
You're a professional hunter, aren't you?!

10
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,537
Is there a tongue in your mouth,
or are you just being rude?

11
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:36,846
Or is that sword just for show?

12
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,978
Maybe you'll say something if
I take it from you?

13
00:08:43,202 --> 00:08:44,402
Try this!

14
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,649
Not too bad!

15
00:08:48,673 --> 00:08:49,673
but...

16
00:09:02,243 --> 00:09:03,842
You're not the hunter I'm looking for!!

17
00:09:03,866 --> 00:09:04,388
So...

18
00:09:05,312 --> 00:09:08,076
Now, leave the sword
and take your fancy costume!

19
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:25,356
No wait!

20
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,677
I was wrong, you really are a hunter!

21
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,996
...and a vampire hunter too!!

22
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:31,869
I..I'm not wrong am I?

23
00:09:31,893 --> 00:09:32,918
I'm sorry.

24
00:09:33,619 --> 00:09:35,118
I know what I did was unforgivable,

25
00:09:35,642 --> 00:09:37,269
but I had to see what you could do.

26
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,271
I need the best hunter I can find!!

27
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,011
And I need to show you something!!

28
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,782
This is...

29
00:09:49,523 --> 00:09:51,388
I..It's the kiss of a powerful noble.

30
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:10,340
What's your name?

31
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:14,672
It's Doris Lang.
Will you take this job for me?

32
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:17,182
I don't have much money, but...

33
00:10:18,518 --> 00:10:20,213
I can feed you three meals a day.

34
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:21,586
and as for the rest...

35
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:23,510
I swear, you can do
whatever you want with me.

36
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:26,086
When did the noble attack you?

37
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:27,958
Does that mean you'll do it?!

38
00:11:07,401 --> 00:11:08,126
Dang!

39
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:13,335
Hey Sis!

40
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:15,003
Dan!

41
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,474
Hey wait! I'll do that
for you mister.

42
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:29,280
Oh wow!
Your horse is a DL4 cyborg! Huh?

43
00:11:30,757 --> 00:11:33,352
I guess you're the kind who
doesn't talk a whole lot. Right mister?

44
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:37,253
My friend Dr. Ferringo says
there are two kinds of quiet men.

45
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:40,058
The kind who stays silent
because they're thinkin' bad things...

46
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,368
and the ones who've seen
a lot of bad things,

47
00:11:42,492 --> 00:11:44,792
and don't want to talk about them
more than they have to.

48
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,068
So...

49
00:11:48,292 --> 00:11:50,586
I'm guessin' that you're
more like the second type, right?

50
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,400
I mean, you seem okay to me!

51
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:50,460
Well hello, Doris!

52
00:12:51,204 --> 00:12:52,296
Greco...

53
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:55,841
I see by your collar the rumors were true.

54
00:12:57,043 --> 00:12:58,335
W...what are you talking about?

55
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:02,573
Just somethin' I'd like to chew over
with your toothsome self.

56
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:15,351
So what do you want?

57
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:16,432
Spare me the biting tone.

58
00:13:16,456 --> 00:13:19,456
I'm not the one they say
was nibbled on by the Count.

59
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:21,231
And what does that mean!?

60
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:23,630
It means, you might want
to keep your voice down.

61
00:13:23,904 --> 00:13:24,934
Or don't you care

62
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:26,758
if sweet little Danny overhears the truth?

63
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:29,769
The thing is,

64
00:13:29,793 --> 00:13:32,993
I'm hurt you didn't come to me
about this first.

65
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:35,774
After all, I'm not only the mayor's son,

66
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,043
but I can hire much better hunters

67
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,067
than that saddle tramp you found.

68
00:13:40,086 --> 00:13:41,644
That's just what friends do.

69
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:45,610
I'm willing to overlook all our
unfortunate past history.

70
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:48,059
And all you have to do is ma...

71
00:13:50,797 --> 00:13:52,158
What the hell is wrong with you?!

72
00:13:52,182 --> 00:13:52,942
That hurt!

73
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:54,533
And I don't like being hit on either!

74
00:13:54,768 --> 00:13:56,096
Look Doris,

75
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,020
I'm just trying to say

76
00:13:58,044 --> 00:14:00,044
that I'm worried about you.

77
00:14:00,068 --> 00:14:02,068
And that I'm here in your time of need.

78
00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:04,308
If you think that you can
vie my gratitude that easily,

79
00:14:04,332 --> 00:14:05,320
think again!

80
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,073
I've seen far too many decent people suffer

81
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:09,097
because of the actions of you and your cronies!

82
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,474
You're so adorable

83
00:14:11,498 --> 00:14:12,894
when you're being self righteous.

84
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:14,386
I can't stand it.

85
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,978
Now how about you shut up and...

86
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:18,651
You little trollop!

87
00:14:18,675 --> 00:14:19,975
No one does that to me!

88
00:14:24,402 --> 00:14:25,402
Damn!

89
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:37,870
Hey boss, you okay?

90
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:39,681
Everyone, listen up!

91
00:14:39,705 --> 00:14:41,305
Doris Lang was attacked by the Count!

92
00:14:41,915 --> 00:14:43,815
She's been infected with vampirism!

93
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,326
It's true.

94
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:47,381
That's why she hired that hunter!

95
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:00,623
Oh sis...?

96
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:14,938
So you're

97
00:15:14,962 --> 00:15:16,862
a vampire hunter are you?

98
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,073
That's right.

99
00:15:20,521 --> 00:15:22,045
My God Doris...are you...?

100
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:27,159
Say something sis...

101
00:15:27,694 --> 00:15:28,725
Hmm yup.

102
00:15:28,749 --> 00:15:30,706
It's just as I said isn't it daddy?

103
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:31,760
No way!

104
00:15:31,784 --> 00:15:32,675
She's fine!

105
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:33,875
And you're just spreading lies

106
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:35,111
'cause she turned you down!

107
00:15:35,335 --> 00:15:36,295
What'd you say

108
00:15:36,303 --> 00:15:37,327
you little brat!

109
00:15:37,551 --> 00:15:38,580
Why I oughta kick your...

110
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:39,093
Greco!

111
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:40,036
But, pa!

112
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,097
That kid just called me a stickin' liar!

113
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:44,367
You're a fool who's
interrupting important business.

114
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:45,535
Wait outside!

115
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:47,943
And as for you Miss Lang,

116
00:15:48,067 --> 00:15:49,226
you know the rules.

117
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,381
Anyone who's been bitten,

118
00:15:50,605 --> 00:15:51,705
must go to the camp.

119
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:54,082
Sheriff!

120
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:56,852
No, you can't do this!

121
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:58,717
You can't take my sister!

122
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,516
Please think about this sheriff.

123
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:03,193
That camp isn't fit
for human habitation.

124
00:16:03,396 --> 00:16:04,493
It's worse than a pigsty.

125
00:16:05,117 --> 00:16:06,417
As the town doctor,

126
00:16:06,441 --> 00:16:07,876
I can't condone sending this girl

127
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,767
to live in a wreck that
hasn't been used for 50 years.

128
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,930
That may be, but the law is the law.

129
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,234
And does the law
remember the nightmare

130
00:16:16,242 --> 00:16:18,340
this town lived through 50 years ago

131
00:16:18,364 --> 00:16:20,064
the last time that camp was used?

132
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,071
Exactly what happened 50 years ago?

133
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:27,183
There was a girl sheriff
a girl who was attacked, like Doris.

134
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:30,185
We locked her in the camp
for our own protection,

135
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,181
not hers.

136
00:16:31,205 --> 00:16:33,005
And that so infuriated the Count

137
00:16:33,029 --> 00:16:36,129
that he brutally murdered
30 villagers in retribution.

138
00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:39,426
And what happened to girl Doctor?

139
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:43,960
She went completely mad
and died in the camp.

140
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:46,636
This wisest move

141
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,160
would be to let the girl stay free

142
00:16:48,184 --> 00:16:49,884
until I've fullfilled my contract.

143
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:56,278
Those are brave words stranger,
but what if you fail?

144
00:16:56,316 --> 00:16:58,478
The Count's not the only vampire up there.

145
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:00,983
If it comes down to that,

146
00:17:01,007 --> 00:17:02,964
I swear that I will take my own life!

147
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:03,955
No sis!

148
00:17:17,804 --> 00:17:19,071
Dan, listen...

149
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:23,642
Hello, welco...

150
00:17:23,943 --> 00:17:25,112
Hello, Mr. Whatley.

151
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:27,122
I need the usual supplies.

152
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:29,007
A month's worth of fertilizer,

153
00:17:29,231 --> 00:17:30,331
five packs of dried meat,

154
00:17:30,355 --> 00:17:31,727
some canned goods.

155
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:33,716
Sorry, but we're all are sold out.

156
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,063
What?

157
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:36,145
But, Mr. Whatley!

158
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,283
What are you talking about Whatley?

159
00:17:38,507 --> 00:17:39,707
Any fool can see

160
00:17:39,731 --> 00:17:41,136
that you have plenty of stock.

161
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,095
Look Doc,

162
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:43,419
did you see how they skedaddled

163
00:17:43,443 --> 00:17:44,573
when she came in?

164
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:46,197
She's in cahoots with the vampires.

165
00:17:46,221 --> 00:17:47,321
I can't sell to her.

166
00:17:47,434 --> 00:17:48,264
What?!

167
00:17:48,388 --> 00:17:49,388
Cahoots?

168
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:53,294
It's only going to get harder going forward.

169
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:55,532
And it's alright to scream or cry.

170
00:17:55,956 --> 00:17:58,256
How you choose to deal with it is up to you.

171
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:00,635
But promise me one thing Dan.

172
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:02,114
If you're going to cry,

173
00:18:02,138 --> 00:18:03,558
don't do it around your sister.

174
00:18:04,082 --> 00:18:05,347
Hold it in.

175
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:07,143
Tears are contagious

176
00:18:07,167 --> 00:18:08,467
and right now she needs your

177
00:18:08,491 --> 00:18:09,698
hope and encouragement.

178
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:11,212
Smile.

179
00:18:11,436 --> 00:18:12,567
Even if it hurts.

180
00:18:13,591 --> 00:18:15,080
That's what being a man means.

181
00:19:06,846 --> 00:19:08,381
Feeling moody today are we?

182
00:19:08,905 --> 00:19:11,005
You're not acting like yourself.

183
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,141
Protecting this girl,

184
00:19:13,265 --> 00:19:14,765
counseling her brother...

185
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,679
and offering advice.

186
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,117
It's almost as though

187
00:19:18,141 --> 00:19:19,217
you have a heart.

188
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,241
Don't tell me that

189
00:19:20,265 --> 00:19:21,370
you've fall in love.

190
00:19:21,394 --> 00:19:22,686
That's enough old fool!

191
00:19:23,196 --> 00:19:24,054
Of course,

192
00:19:24,064 --> 00:19:25,160
she did offer you

193
00:19:25,184 --> 00:19:26,760
her body didn't she.

194
00:19:26,784 --> 00:19:29,084
Not that you'd be interested in that.

195
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:30,359
The only bodies

196
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:31,523
that you're interested in

197
00:19:31,523 --> 00:19:32,699
are dead nobles

198
00:19:32,699 --> 00:19:34,267
stacked up like cordwood.

199
00:19:34,763 --> 00:19:35,763
Poor D.

200
00:19:36,142 --> 00:19:37,303
Fated to live a life

201
00:19:37,303 --> 00:19:39,396
drenched in blood and carnage.

202
00:19:39,644 --> 00:19:41,269
Are you jealous for the warmth

203
00:19:41,269 --> 00:19:42,933
of a real human being?

204
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:45,180
Thank you for your help this afternoon.

205
00:19:45,404 --> 00:19:46,862
I know you talked to Dan.

206
00:19:46,986 --> 00:19:48,077
He's been trying hard

207
00:19:48,077 --> 00:19:49,077
to keep my spirits up.

208
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:52,692
My father was a hunter too.

209
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:54,416
Werewolf, not vampire.

210
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:55,955
That's how I knew

211
00:19:55,955 --> 00:19:57,482
what kind of skills to look for.

212
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:00,123
"If you should ever have to fight
against the nobility."

213
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:01,363
He said.

214
00:20:01,387 --> 00:20:03,744
"You need a hunter who specializes in them."

215
00:20:03,768 --> 00:20:05,213
No one else stands a chance.

216
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:07,701
So, what can you tell me about the nobles?

217
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,432
Tomorrow is the "Woman's Moon".

218
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:11,203
"Woman's Moon"?

219
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,305
You mean the red moon
that appears once a month?

220
00:20:13,446 --> 00:20:14,280
Yes.

221
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,332
The nobles consider blood

222
00:20:15,556 --> 00:20:16,742
taken under that moon impure,

223
00:20:16,842 --> 00:20:17,978
unfit to drink.

224
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,383
Which means that if someone comes for you

225
00:20:20,383 --> 00:20:21,639
it will be tonight.

226
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:23,484
So who is this noble I seek?

227
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:25,122
Count Magnus Lee.

228
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,659
It's said that he ruled this land

229
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:28,479
long before our village was established.

230
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:30,518
However, years ago he disappearred...

231
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:32,626
and most thought him gone forever.

232
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:34,750
But then the light reappeared in his castle

233
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:35,819
two years ago

234
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:37,019
and we knew he had returned.

235
00:20:37,143 --> 00:20:38,480
Some say he's 5,000

236
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,556
or even 10,000 years old.

237
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,980
In either case, he's incredibly old,

238
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,280
and powerful.

239
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,236
Ten thousand years...

240
00:20:47,236 --> 00:20:48,836
a vampire that old will be formidable.

241
00:21:28,921 --> 00:21:29,979
Here they come.

242
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:35,280
How are you going to fight them?

243
00:21:35,288 --> 00:21:36,488
I'll want to fight beside you.

244
00:21:37,263 --> 00:21:40,232
Crosses and garlic will have no effect
on this advance guard.

245
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,237
The nobility expect such tricks.

246
00:21:43,061 --> 00:21:44,661
That's why they'll attack first

247
00:21:44,661 --> 00:21:46,361
using mutants and werewolves.

248
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,047
So, she's hired a bodyguard has she?

249
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:41,381
Exactly the sort of thing one would
expect from a lowly human.

250
00:22:43,226 --> 00:22:44,656
Where is the Count?

251
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:46,964
I've been told a girl resides here

252
00:22:46,988 --> 00:22:49,188
whose beauty is unrivaled in this land.

253
00:22:49,502 --> 00:22:50,567
One whose blood is like

254
00:22:50,567 --> 00:22:51,967
the sweetest ambrosia.

255
00:22:52,291 --> 00:22:53,548
Or so my father says.

256
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:54,799
Leastway, he sent me

257
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,059
to fetch his newest play thing.

258
00:22:56,407 --> 00:22:58,375
But first, in so much as she's failed

259
00:22:58,375 --> 00:23:00,275
to deliver herself to his table.

260
00:23:00,399 --> 00:23:02,499
The lowly human must be punished.

261
00:23:03,182 --> 00:23:05,516
As for you,
you shall die a horrible death.

262
00:23:05,525 --> 00:23:08,016
And then the girl will be
dealt with at our leisure.

263
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:12,283
I am Rei-Ginsei,

264
00:23:12,283 --> 00:23:13,779
and my master commands me

265
00:23:13,779 --> 00:23:15,505
to slaughter all fools such as you.

266
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:17,458
Now you die!

267
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:45,980
You're better than I expected,

268
00:23:46,004 --> 00:23:47,301
but that ends now.

269
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:49,889
I've been playing with you.

270
00:24:23,896 --> 00:24:24,958
Interesting...

271
00:24:24,998 --> 00:24:26,533
I've heard rumors about a mutant

272
00:24:26,557 --> 00:24:28,857
who could warp the fabric
of time and space.

273
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:30,659
Would that be you?

274
00:24:34,606 --> 00:24:35,973
That it would.

275
00:24:36,197 --> 00:24:37,897
And now I shall take your head.

276
00:24:43,548 --> 00:24:44,981
That's impossible!

277
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:52,246
I see, he is a dhampir...

278
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:56,790
Rei, I shall handle this.

279
00:24:57,029 --> 00:24:58,087
But I was about to...

280
00:24:58,263 --> 00:24:59,291
I said fall back!

281
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,500
If that is your wish...noble mistress...

282
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:06,766
So, a dhampir?

283
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:08,316
I've never seen one before.

284
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,131
No doubt the bastard offspring

285
00:25:10,131 --> 00:25:12,125
of some noble's human dalliance!

286
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:14,441
A more vexing problem than mere humans!

287
00:25:15,114 --> 00:25:16,515
My business

288
00:25:16,539 --> 00:25:18,639
is with your master and not you girl.

289
00:25:19,718 --> 00:25:21,715
I'd prefer not to kill you.

290
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,787
How dare you!

291
00:25:23,987 --> 00:25:26,187
As if some lowly dhampir could defeat me?!

292
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:39,231
Go back to your master and tell him this...

293
00:25:39,571 --> 00:25:41,766
you are but transient guests on this planet.

294
00:25:41,866 --> 00:25:43,866
Fated to return to the darkness.

295
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:45,667
Did he just say transient guests?

296
00:26:03,195 --> 00:26:05,186
Has my daughter returned yet?

297
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:10,192
No, the fools acted without
begging my leave...

298
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:12,966
but I'll deal with them later.

299
00:26:14,273 --> 00:26:15,797
A dhampir you say?

300
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:19,477
One so formidable that
L'armica and Rei had to retreat?

301
00:26:19,801 --> 00:26:21,501
How very unexpected...

302
00:26:22,114 --> 00:26:23,380
and intriguing.

303
00:26:23,604 --> 00:26:26,204
Something to anticipate after so long.

304
00:26:29,723 --> 00:26:30,823
Oh Count Dracula,

305
00:26:31,347 --> 00:26:33,047
our most sacred ancestor!

306
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:35,456
Save my father from his folly.

307
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:38,521
Convince him that his plan
to bring a lowly human

308
00:26:38,545 --> 00:26:41,345
into the fold of our family can only
end in pain and disaster.

309
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:44,931
I can not allow him to foolishly
taint our noble blood.

310
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,498
Please Dracula...

311
00:26:46,922 --> 00:26:48,022
help me!

312
00:26:52,577 --> 00:26:54,745
Lady L'armica,
you should return to your room now.

313
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:57,513
I don't recall giving you
leave to speak you mutant worm.

314
00:26:57,649 --> 00:26:58,682
That may be...

315
00:26:58,706 --> 00:27:00,506
but I was just admonished by the Count

316
00:27:00,506 --> 00:27:02,503
for our failure to fulfill his orders.

317
00:27:02,827 --> 00:27:04,527
And it is he, not I,

318
00:27:04,527 --> 00:27:06,860
who commands you to your room mistress.

319
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,250
Did I say that you can touch me,
you wretch!

320
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:13,230
I know you seek to ingratiate
yourself with my father.

321
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:15,527
To become part of our noble family.

322
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:17,290
But you remain blind to the truth

323
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:19,086
of your own lowly lineage.

324
00:27:19,572 --> 00:27:23,768
As if we would allow one of such debased
blood to become part of this family!

325
00:29:59,864 --> 00:30:01,531
D, this is too easy...

326
00:30:01,855 --> 00:30:02,955
it's a trap!

327
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:03,992
I know it is.

328
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:26,817
Ghost beast!

329
00:30:35,066 --> 00:30:36,294
Let's try this!

330
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:04,485
So, we meet again hunter.

331
00:31:05,064 --> 00:31:08,561
My, not only have you managed
to escape our ghost jaguar,

332
00:31:08,561 --> 00:31:10,961
but your arms are still
attached to your body.

333
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:13,030
Truly you are a dhampir

334
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,530
to be reckoned with.

335
00:31:20,845 --> 00:31:24,576
I would prefer to settle our
matter from yesterday personally.

336
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:27,375
However, the count has given
me specific instructions

337
00:31:27,375 --> 00:31:29,075
regarding your destination.

338
00:31:29,899 --> 00:31:30,899
So...

339
00:32:17,667 --> 00:32:19,658
I told you this was a trap.

340
00:32:19,658 --> 00:32:20,724
Didn't I?

341
00:32:21,048 --> 00:32:22,048
Woah...

342
00:32:22,072 --> 00:32:24,350
These must be ruins from the war

343
00:32:24,374 --> 00:32:26,074
10,000 years ago.

344
00:32:26,198 --> 00:32:29,598
Talk about putting everything else
into proper perspective.

345
00:34:01,371 --> 00:34:02,636
Who are you sir?

346
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:04,272
Who are you sir?

347
00:34:07,577 --> 00:34:09,067
Why don't you answer?

348
00:34:09,379 --> 00:34:10,846
Why don't you answer?

349
00:34:11,548 --> 00:34:12,776
Who are you three?

350
00:34:13,216 --> 00:34:14,274
Who are we three?

351
00:34:15,252 --> 00:34:16,549
Who are we three?

352
00:34:19,456 --> 00:34:21,521
This is what we are!

353
00:34:36,739 --> 00:34:38,129
So, you're lamia!

354
00:34:41,223 --> 00:34:42,723
Clever...clever...

355
00:34:43,047 --> 00:34:44,647
so clever...

356
00:34:44,848 --> 00:34:46,776
We sisters are the infamous

357
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,600
Midwich Medusas!

358
00:34:49,219 --> 00:34:51,449
Sister...it's been so long...

359
00:34:52,222 --> 00:34:54,581
Shall we savor his taste slowly.

360
00:34:54,858 --> 00:34:57,685
Yes! Let us sap his life essense.

361
00:34:58,409 --> 00:35:00,509
To the marrow of his bone!

362
00:35:16,746 --> 00:35:18,249
Please, have courage child.

363
00:35:18,573 --> 00:35:20,173
He's certain to be back soon.

364
00:35:20,597 --> 00:35:23,097
That man's forged more
from steel than flesh.

365
00:35:23,553 --> 00:35:25,580
And I doubt he'll be beaten so easily.

366
00:35:25,989 --> 00:35:28,521
Say...you're not falling for him are you?!

367
00:35:29,945 --> 00:35:31,545
Oh my god, you are!

368
00:35:31,628 --> 00:35:32,659
Trust me Doris!

369
00:35:32,763 --> 00:35:34,727
He's not the kind
of man you think he is.

370
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:36,995
I'm not saying that he's an evil man,

371
00:35:37,019 --> 00:35:38,919
but he has...dangerous eyes.

372
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:40,930
Dangerous eyes?

373
00:35:40,938 --> 00:35:41,896
Yes.

374
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,996
The eyes of a warrior.

375
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,220
A man who lives on the razor's edge,

376
00:35:45,275 --> 00:35:46,869
between life and death.

377
00:35:46,893 --> 00:35:48,493
When the violence has ended

378
00:35:48,817 --> 00:35:50,217
he'll be gone.

379
00:35:52,241 --> 00:35:53,241
They're here!

380
00:36:16,273 --> 00:36:17,199
Quiet!

381
00:36:17,323 --> 00:36:18,423
Cease struggling.

382
00:36:18,747 --> 00:36:20,747
The Count's waited long enough.

383
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:22,436
If the Count wants me,

384
00:36:22,536 --> 00:36:23,699
then just let the other go!!

385
00:36:23,847 --> 00:36:24,846
Oh no!

386
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:27,570
I couldn't deprive my comrades
of all that fresh meat!

387
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,782
Wait...if anything happens to them,

388
00:36:31,882 --> 00:36:33,982
I swear I'll bite my tongue
and kill myself.

389
00:36:34,991 --> 00:36:38,254
The Count did instruct me to
bring you in intact and unharmed.

390
00:36:38,461 --> 00:36:40,019
So, I accept your terms.

391
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:42,522
Now put that back in your mouth.

392
00:36:42,746 --> 00:36:43,946
It's crude.

393
00:36:49,673 --> 00:36:51,103
Oh sweet Doris,

394
00:36:51,627 --> 00:36:54,027
come tomorrow you shall be
both nobility

395
00:36:54,027 --> 00:36:55,263
and my bride.

396
00:36:55,411 --> 00:36:57,611
Why resist the inevitable?

397
00:36:58,015 --> 00:36:58,811
I'd rather die!

398
00:36:59,182 --> 00:37:01,345
But I'll not be held as a prisoner
in this castle for long!

399
00:37:01,369 --> 00:37:03,069
I'll be gone by morning light!

400
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,847
How droll.

401
00:37:04,871 --> 00:37:07,471
But those impertinent lips will soon be mine.

402
00:37:07,657 --> 00:37:09,922
Therefore, I will forgive such impudence

403
00:37:09,946 --> 00:37:11,371
just this once.

404
00:37:11,595 --> 00:37:12,632
But Doris,

405
00:37:12,656 --> 00:37:14,656
if you think your hunter
will come to save you,

406
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,580
you might want to reconsider.

407
00:37:18,604 --> 00:37:20,504
Behold your hero!

408
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:31,347
D!!

409
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:35,908
As you can see the sisters are
draining him of his vital essence.

410
00:37:36,253 --> 00:37:37,017
Ah,

411
00:37:37,041 --> 00:37:39,241
look at the sweet ecstasy on their faces.

412
00:37:39,622 --> 00:37:41,747
They've been in the throws of pleasure

413
00:37:42,025 --> 00:37:43,458
for half the day.

414
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:45,688
A normal man would
have perished in minutes.

415
00:37:45,729 --> 00:37:47,624
But then he is a dhampir.

416
00:37:49,099 --> 00:37:50,157
What?!

417
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:51,500
D is a...

418
00:37:51,524 --> 00:37:52,579
he's a dhampir?

419
00:37:52,903 --> 00:37:54,671
Oh my, you didn't know?

420
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:58,337
Yes, the baseborn result of a
liason between human and noble.

421
00:37:58,708 --> 00:38:00,369
These things do happen.

422
00:38:00,744 --> 00:38:01,276
Surprised?

423
00:38:02,012 --> 00:38:03,577
Or could it be you...

424
00:38:03,701 --> 00:38:05,601
find this more arousing than expected?

425
00:38:05,782 --> 00:38:07,613
No! Stop it! You monster!

426
00:38:08,318 --> 00:38:09,247
Ah yes.

427
00:38:09,571 --> 00:38:12,271
You should retire to your
bedchamber shouldn't you.

428
00:38:18,195 --> 00:38:19,164
Sleep...

429
00:38:19,164 --> 00:38:22,064
Sleep for the remainder
of this cursed sanguine moon.

430
00:38:22,812 --> 00:38:24,912
For tomorrow we will wed.

431
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:41,616
So much sustenance,

432
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:44,240
but will his endurance overwhelm us sisters?

433
00:38:44,454 --> 00:38:47,082
His endurance overwhelms us.

434
00:38:59,469 --> 00:39:01,430
No! Sisters he wakes!

435
00:39:23,059 --> 00:39:25,721
This woman is to join
the Lee family father?

436
00:39:26,663 --> 00:39:29,154
This is the slattern you chose
to take my mother's place?

437
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:47,914
You can't fight your lineage, can you?

438
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:49,887
Deny it all you want,

439
00:39:49,911 --> 00:39:51,511
but when push comes to shove

440
00:39:51,511 --> 00:39:52,675
the fangs are coming out!

441
00:39:53,023 --> 00:39:53,955
That's enough.

442
00:39:54,324 --> 00:39:55,858
Someone's feeling grumpy.

443
00:39:56,793 --> 00:39:58,784
Too bad. It's still your destiny.

444
00:39:58,862 --> 00:40:01,456
I wonder.
Do I really need two hands?

445
00:40:02,031 --> 00:40:03,999
Fine...my lips are sealed.

446
00:40:05,836 --> 00:40:06,861
What is it?

447
00:40:06,885 --> 00:40:09,485
What is it about her that
my father cannot resist?

448
00:40:10,339 --> 00:40:11,440
But I will not allow it!

449
00:40:12,264 --> 00:40:13,964
You will never join the Lee bloodline

450
00:40:13,988 --> 00:40:15,888
you human bitch!

451
00:40:18,381 --> 00:40:18,947
Damn you!

452
00:42:07,824 --> 00:42:09,917
Golem!

453
00:42:59,542 --> 00:43:00,839
Golem!

454
00:43:31,742 --> 00:43:32,766
Gimlet!

455
00:43:39,249 --> 00:43:42,377
I can't return to the
castle, until I've finished him.

456
00:43:53,429 --> 00:43:54,157
Sis.

457
00:43:54,264 --> 00:43:54,923
Sis!

458
00:43:55,147 --> 00:43:56,047
Doris!

459
00:43:57,667 --> 00:43:59,498
Dan. Where's D?

460
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:01,699
Oh he said that he was gonna go outside

461
00:44:01,699 --> 00:44:03,592
and try to fix the damage to the wall.

462
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,232
Man that guy is sure awesome!

463
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:07,870
First he rescues you from that
horrible place all by himself.

464
00:44:08,094 --> 00:44:09,394
And when he gets back

465
00:44:09,418 --> 00:44:10,690
does he take a break?

466
00:44:10,714 --> 00:44:14,043
No way! He just gets right
to doing what needs doin'.

467
00:44:14,451 --> 00:44:16,479
It's like he doesn't even need to rest!

468
00:44:18,488 --> 00:44:19,455
A noble!

469
00:44:19,956 --> 00:44:21,048
That's a noble's carraige!

470
00:44:21,224 --> 00:44:22,450
What's a noble doing here?

471
00:44:26,129 --> 00:44:27,523
Oh what's wrong hunnykins?

472
00:44:27,864 --> 00:44:30,628
Come on, let's get a room
so we can drink some more.

473
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,462
Back to the cat house
you floosies!

474
00:44:33,469 --> 00:44:34,927
That's no way to treat a lady!

475
00:44:38,041 --> 00:44:39,130
What's the lowdown pops!?

476
00:44:39,242 --> 00:44:41,176
I..I..It's one of the
nobility's servants...

477
00:44:41,411 --> 00:44:42,605
Yeah, I know! Hold still.

478
00:44:42,629 --> 00:44:44,429
I need the key to the secret spy room.

479
00:44:45,982 --> 00:44:49,042
I bring a message on behalf of the count.

480
00:44:49,352 --> 00:44:50,544
Do you now...?

481
00:44:50,568 --> 00:44:52,868
and would that message involve killing me?

482
00:44:53,256 --> 00:44:56,322
No, that would be a fool's errand.

483
00:44:57,046 --> 00:44:59,646
One such as I could never defeat you.

484
00:45:00,162 --> 00:45:01,828
The price for failure is death.

485
00:45:02,352 --> 00:45:05,052
I doubt that the Count will change
the rules of his castle

486
00:45:05,052 --> 00:45:06,552
just to accommodate me.

487
00:45:12,408 --> 00:45:14,768
Killing that man will be difficult.

488
00:45:15,092 --> 00:45:16,992
So the Count has sent you this.

489
00:45:17,747 --> 00:45:18,977
No, it can't be!

490
00:45:19,301 --> 00:45:20,860
Is that what I think it is?

491
00:45:20,984 --> 00:45:21,952
Yes.

492
00:45:22,376 --> 00:45:24,576
The Time Bewitching Incense.

493
00:45:25,388 --> 00:45:26,946
Time bewitching what?

494
00:45:41,804 --> 00:45:43,066
D!! Have you seen Dan?

495
00:45:43,339 --> 00:45:44,772
Your brother has been taken.

496
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:45,997
That's Dan's gun!

497
00:45:46,343 --> 00:45:48,506
I don't understand.
I'm the one the nobility wants?

498
00:45:48,706 --> 00:45:50,032
Why would they take my brother?

499
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:52,211
Just what does that letter say?
Let me see!

500
00:45:52,515 --> 00:45:53,609
Is this some kind of code?

501
00:45:53,610 --> 00:45:54,591
Yes.

502
00:45:54,716 --> 00:45:55,853
It's written in a language

503
00:45:55,853 --> 00:45:58,353
understood only by hunters
and professional assassins.

504
00:45:59,088 --> 00:46:00,753
It says, that in order to save Dan,

505
00:46:00,777 --> 00:46:02,577
I must come alone.

506
00:46:03,026 --> 00:46:05,517
They're obviously
attempting to separate us.

507
00:46:05,762 --> 00:46:06,954
I don't understand.

508
00:46:07,178 --> 00:46:09,278
If they have Dan, why not
just order me to come?

509
00:46:09,632 --> 00:46:11,229
It would seem the being who wrote this

510
00:46:11,229 --> 00:46:13,188
has a personal score to settle as well.

511
00:46:13,536 --> 00:46:16,774
And beyond that, the nobility would
consider it beneath their honor

512
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:19,328
to use the boy as bait to lure you
into their trap.

513
00:46:19,676 --> 00:46:21,039
Beneath their honor!?

514
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:23,212
As if their kind has honor to begin with!

515
00:46:23,436 --> 00:46:24,936
They're blood sucking monsters!

516
00:46:25,583 --> 00:46:26,472
Um...

517
00:46:27,196 --> 00:46:28,561
Present company excepted.

518
00:46:28,585 --> 00:46:30,747
There's no reason to make exceptions.

519
00:46:30,771 --> 00:46:32,971
To be born a dhampir is to be a monster.

520
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:36,559
The blood running in my veins
is that of the hated nobility.

521
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:38,327
But it's not the same.

522
00:46:38,528 --> 00:46:40,420
I know that you only hide your true nature

523
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:42,451
to keep others from
worrying unnecessarily.

524
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:45,167
And I wish I hadn't learned the way I did.

525
00:46:52,609 --> 00:46:53,701
Ah, you're here.

526
00:46:54,310 --> 00:46:55,334
Where is the boy?

527
00:46:57,113 --> 00:46:58,705
Mr. D!

528
00:46:59,048 --> 00:47:00,709
Help me!!!

529
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:05,813
Quiet! I'll get you down
once I've killed your friend.

530
00:47:06,022 --> 00:47:07,614
Just hang on to your patience.

531
00:47:10,126 --> 00:47:13,323
Mr. D, I'm scared!!!

532
00:47:13,463 --> 00:47:14,157
Bastard!

533
00:47:15,064 --> 00:47:16,395
Let's finish this.

534
00:47:34,050 --> 00:47:34,884
D, watch out!

535
00:47:34,908 --> 00:47:36,708
That's Time Bewitching Incense!

536
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:38,944
It...it's not working!

537
00:47:50,199 --> 00:47:53,498
Dan, please come home safely, please.

538
00:47:53,803 --> 00:47:55,236
If you die...

539
00:47:55,605 --> 00:47:57,800
Doris, it's me. Dr. Ferringo!

540
00:47:57,907 --> 00:47:58,839
Doctor!!

541
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:00,704
The barrier's still up. Let me in!

542
00:48:02,412 --> 00:48:03,813
Hold on, I'm coming!

543
00:48:03,937 --> 00:48:05,591
Thank God you're here.

544
00:48:05,815 --> 00:48:07,642
I've been with a sick patient
in the village.

545
00:48:08,217 --> 00:48:10,646
I'm sorry for the nightmare
that you've endured,

546
00:48:10,646 --> 00:48:12,146
and for taking so long.

547
00:48:12,555 --> 00:48:15,922
But, I thought of a place
where we can be safe.

548
00:48:17,794 --> 00:48:21,061
My hand!
Someone switched candles on me!

549
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:22,031
How sad.

550
00:48:22,355 --> 00:48:24,055
Done in by your own stupidity.

551
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:26,831
It makes you question your life choices.
Doesn't it?

552
00:48:27,437 --> 00:48:28,504
Damn it!

553
00:48:28,928 --> 00:48:31,028
Do you have to be condescending as well?

554
00:48:34,744 --> 00:48:37,212
Are you sure this place
really exists Doctor?

555
00:48:37,213 --> 00:48:38,055
Yes.

556
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:41,571
I first discovered it when I was
returning from old man Harker's place

557
00:48:41,571 --> 00:48:43,104
via the northern forest.

558
00:48:43,452 --> 00:48:45,215
And then there it was.

559
00:48:45,489 --> 00:48:49,555
An ancient stone building with some
kind of mysterious writing on its walls.

560
00:48:49,579 --> 00:48:50,703
A safe house.

561
00:48:50,927 --> 00:48:53,860
Something in that old structure
repels the vampires.

562
00:48:54,584 --> 00:48:56,884
We'll wait there until
your brother's rescued.

563
00:49:08,244 --> 00:49:09,404
One of the female nobles!

564
00:49:09,479 --> 00:49:11,174
Whoa, whoa!

565
00:49:11,481 --> 00:49:12,880
Doris, turn this cart around!

566
00:49:12,982 --> 00:49:13,880
There's no room!

567
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:15,473
But I can handle this one!

568
00:49:15,997 --> 00:49:17,397
Oh no you don't.

569
00:49:21,390 --> 00:49:22,584
Doctor!! What are you doing!?

570
00:49:24,594 --> 00:49:26,326
I was the doctor my dear...

571
00:49:26,796 --> 00:49:28,354
but I've changed!

572
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:31,032
No! No!!!

573
00:49:33,669 --> 00:49:35,367
Not you too.

574
00:49:38,107 --> 00:49:40,075
What brings you out here my lady?

575
00:49:41,410 --> 00:49:44,470
Um, the Count has ordered me
to take this one to the castle.

576
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,674
Bring her to me.

577
00:49:46,881 --> 00:49:47,772
Yes mistress.

578
00:49:48,817 --> 00:49:52,617
How strange, until yesterday this
girl was like my own granddaughter.

579
00:49:53,855 --> 00:49:54,984
But seeing her now,

580
00:49:54,984 --> 00:49:58,884
I realize that I was a fool for not
violating this beautiful body.

581
00:50:00,463 --> 00:50:02,898
Do you suppose the Count
will let me have a taste

582
00:50:02,922 --> 00:50:05,922
before he claims her and
sucks her sweet husk dry?

583
00:50:06,635 --> 00:50:07,932
You annoy me.

584
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:11,798
No!!

585
00:50:13,009 --> 00:50:14,101
Doris please...

586
00:50:15,912 --> 00:50:16,970
No...Doctor!!

587
00:50:21,818 --> 00:50:22,842
Why is this happening?

588
00:50:24,253 --> 00:50:25,418
Everyone's gone.

589
00:50:25,642 --> 00:50:27,399
The doctor, Dan and D.

590
00:50:27,823 --> 00:50:28,890
D?

591
00:50:28,914 --> 00:50:31,114
It's the dhampir you care about?

592
00:50:31,394 --> 00:50:34,060
I'd rather die than become
Count Lee's bride.

593
00:50:34,284 --> 00:50:35,340
Just kill me now.

594
00:50:35,864 --> 00:50:37,729
This is all my father's doing.

595
00:50:37,834 --> 00:50:38,601
Fine!

596
00:50:38,825 --> 00:50:39,825
I don't care where you go

597
00:50:39,849 --> 00:50:41,549
as long as that old fool can't find you.

598
00:50:59,355 --> 00:51:00,287
What the...?!

599
00:51:12,568 --> 00:51:13,694
G...Greco?!

600
00:51:14,036 --> 00:51:15,264
This stuff is great...

601
00:51:15,538 --> 00:51:17,631
have Time Bewitching Incense will travel.

602
00:51:18,941 --> 00:51:20,639
I thought it would blind vampires,

603
00:51:20,663 --> 00:51:23,463
but judging by that show
it burns like unholy heck.

604
00:51:23,679 --> 00:51:25,437
And why does someone like you have it?

605
00:51:25,614 --> 00:51:26,512
Does it matter?

606
00:51:26,736 --> 00:51:29,036
The important thing is I
have the Count's daughter.

607
00:51:29,285 --> 00:51:32,454
And that'll let me setup a
real sweetheart deal, sweetheart.

608
00:51:32,521 --> 00:51:33,779
And just what does that mean?

609
00:51:33,856 --> 00:51:36,150
I thought I might draw
the Count out and kill him.

610
00:51:36,625 --> 00:51:39,255
That'll be easy with this
Time Bewitching Incense.

611
00:51:39,328 --> 00:51:42,263
But a favor that size requires
a little advance payment.

612
00:51:42,398 --> 00:51:43,194
What...?!

613
00:51:43,499 --> 00:51:45,958
No pressure.
I can leave you with fangy here.

614
00:51:46,101 --> 00:51:47,831
Or say yes Greco dearest

615
00:51:47,831 --> 00:51:50,123
and we'll be counting
the Count's treasure.

616
00:51:50,172 --> 00:51:51,371
Stop! It's so bright!

617
00:51:51,408 --> 00:51:53,803
You know, you're looking
a little pale Doris dear.

618
00:51:54,376 --> 00:51:57,736
It's a good thing you have someone
like me to protect you, isn't it?

619
00:51:58,547 --> 00:52:00,005
And now I've got a good look.

620
00:52:00,229 --> 00:52:01,661
This one's not too shabby.

621
00:52:01,885 --> 00:52:05,018
Why'd I think female nobility
would be dried up old bats?

622
00:52:05,054 --> 00:52:06,045
Human stop!

623
00:52:06,569 --> 00:52:08,169
Kill me now and be done with it!

624
00:52:08,569 --> 00:52:10,269
Looks like there's a little life left

625
00:52:10,269 --> 00:52:11,869
in the unliving dead girl still, huh?

626
00:52:12,328 --> 00:52:13,463
Kill me already!

627
00:52:13,787 --> 00:52:15,687
I'd rather burn in hell a thousand years

628
00:52:15,687 --> 00:52:17,487
than endure your voice another second!

629
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:19,790
Why you coffin dwellin' tramp!

630
00:52:19,935 --> 00:52:23,093
Kill me! Do it now or I promise I'll
kill you when I have the chance!

631
00:52:23,472 --> 00:52:24,633
Oh enough already!

632
00:52:24,741 --> 00:52:27,608
It's not like I can't lure the Count
out with your staked corpse!

633
00:52:28,711 --> 00:52:30,602
Leave her alone!
She can't even defend herself!!

634
00:52:30,613 --> 00:52:32,012
I'm just making a point!

635
00:52:32,448 --> 00:52:33,210
Oh come on!

636
00:52:38,788 --> 00:52:39,686
Hey sis!

637
00:52:41,123 --> 00:52:41,990
Dan?

638
00:52:42,014 --> 00:52:43,068
Is that you?

639
00:52:43,092 --> 00:52:44,286
Sis, are you okay?

640
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:46,192
Dan, you're really alive!

641
00:52:46,295 --> 00:52:47,091
Dan!

642
00:52:52,001 --> 00:52:54,262
Oh man.
The Doc too...

643
00:52:54,470 --> 00:52:56,461
I had completely given up
hope at that point.

644
00:52:57,206 --> 00:52:59,003
I couldn't have lived if I had lost you.

645
00:52:59,141 --> 00:53:00,832
You gotta be stronger sis!

646
00:53:01,177 --> 00:53:02,441
It's like Mr. D says,

647
00:53:02,465 --> 00:53:04,056
"If you give up, you've already lost".

648
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:05,940
Yes...but...

649
00:53:17,326 --> 00:53:18,691
You're not going to kill me?

650
00:53:19,528 --> 00:53:20,925
Aw don't be stupid!

651
00:53:20,949 --> 00:53:22,849
Only yellow bellied rats kill girls.

652
00:53:23,766 --> 00:53:25,425
I know that this seems strange to you,

653
00:53:26,301 --> 00:53:28,065
but D isn't like the men you've known.

654
00:53:28,389 --> 00:53:31,189
It's not in his nature
to kill for no reason.

655
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,332
You expect me to react like a lowly human,

656
00:53:34,356 --> 00:53:35,421
but I'm not.

657
00:53:35,945 --> 00:53:38,004
Love and emotions do
not exist in our world.

658
00:53:38,214 --> 00:53:40,450
The only law is the
survival of the fittest.

659
00:53:40,974 --> 00:53:42,060
The strong rule.

660
00:53:42,284 --> 00:53:44,184
While the weak, like you humans, serve.

661
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:47,445
So many vampires believe that, and yet...

662
00:53:47,657 --> 00:53:49,153
Your Sacred Ancestor

663
00:53:49,577 --> 00:53:51,077
taught otherwise.

664
00:53:53,162 --> 00:53:54,652
Our Sacred...

665
00:53:55,776 --> 00:53:56,976
Ancestor?

666
00:54:17,019 --> 00:54:18,577
D, the shower...

667
00:54:19,488 --> 00:54:20,387
D...

668
00:54:20,411 --> 00:54:21,411
...D!

669
00:54:23,692 --> 00:54:24,556
Oh D...

670
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:25,524
Is something wrong?

671
00:54:26,028 --> 00:54:27,256
I was afraid you'd left.

672
00:54:27,363 --> 00:54:29,556
After everything that's
happened I thought you might be...

673
00:54:30,366 --> 00:54:32,664
Well, I said some pretty terrible things

674
00:54:32,688 --> 00:54:33,745
and I'm so sorry.

675
00:54:34,269 --> 00:54:35,669
No, it's alright Doris.

676
00:54:35,793 --> 00:54:36,748
I'm used to it.

677
00:54:36,872 --> 00:54:39,363
The thing is, I keep thinking
about what happened to my father.

678
00:54:39,708 --> 00:54:41,408
Even though he was a werewolf hunter.

679
00:54:41,532 --> 00:54:43,532
In the end he was forced to fight vampires.

680
00:54:44,012 --> 00:54:45,639
Nobody can fight forever...

681
00:54:45,848 --> 00:54:46,978
and I was thinking...

682
00:54:47,002 --> 00:54:48,694
that you and I can go someplace and...

683
00:54:49,218 --> 00:54:50,344
That's not possible.

684
00:54:50,552 --> 00:54:51,348
But...

685
00:54:51,453 --> 00:54:53,421
I would only bring you pain and suffering.

686
00:54:53,522 --> 00:54:54,921
But that's not true at all!

687
00:54:55,124 --> 00:54:56,354
And I...

688
00:54:56,678 --> 00:54:58,269
I don't want you to die D!

689
00:54:58,293 --> 00:54:59,021
Enough!

690
00:54:59,094 --> 00:55:01,194
No! I just want to be close to you.

691
00:55:01,418 --> 00:55:02,718
Just this once.

692
00:55:33,929 --> 00:55:35,692
It's all right.
Take my blood.

693
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:52,444
D please.

694
00:55:53,715 --> 00:55:54,682
I can't...

695
00:55:56,918 --> 00:55:59,913
Why can't you at least
be honest with yourself?

696
00:56:00,237 --> 00:56:02,037
So your blood is cursed.

697
00:56:02,292 --> 00:56:04,861
That girl was ready for it
to rise to the occasion.

698
00:56:05,285 --> 00:56:07,185
The great and powerful dhampir.

699
00:56:07,863 --> 00:56:09,621
You know what your father would have done.

700
00:56:09,665 --> 00:56:10,597
That's enough!

701
00:56:10,866 --> 00:56:12,258
Yeah, yeah, whatever...

702
00:56:17,239 --> 00:56:18,335
Oh this bites!

703
00:56:18,707 --> 00:56:19,710
But at least...

704
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:22,534
I managed to hold onto
the Time Bewitching Incense.

705
00:56:24,446 --> 00:56:26,179
So you're the one who stole it!

706
00:56:26,249 --> 00:56:27,409
No...no wait, please!

707
00:56:28,717 --> 00:56:29,851
As you wish.

708
00:56:29,875 --> 00:56:31,475
You'll die slowly.

709
00:57:11,694 --> 00:57:12,752
The Incense!

710
00:57:29,011 --> 00:57:31,545
You were kind enough to let me live, but

711
00:57:31,569 --> 00:57:33,269
I can't be so generous.

712
00:57:37,386 --> 00:57:38,512
You bastard!

713
00:57:39,021 --> 00:57:40,385
Such strong languange.

714
00:57:40,709 --> 00:57:41,809
Take this!

715
00:58:08,283 --> 00:58:10,274
My, what a pretty corpse.

716
00:58:35,110 --> 00:58:36,600
You lose.

717
00:58:50,926 --> 00:58:52,587
And now we're even.

718
00:58:55,197 --> 00:58:55,856
D!

719
00:58:55,964 --> 00:58:57,693
D! Are you alive?!

720
00:58:58,066 --> 00:58:58,760
D!

721
00:58:59,167 --> 00:59:00,264
Mr. D wake up!

722
00:59:00,488 --> 00:59:01,664
You gotta open your eyes!

723
00:59:01,888 --> 00:59:03,088
Mr. D?

724
00:59:03,212 --> 00:59:04,282
D?

725
00:59:04,606 --> 00:59:05,998
D!

726
00:59:09,044 --> 00:59:10,211
Could he...

727
00:59:10,935 --> 00:59:12,135
...be dead?

728
00:59:52,988 --> 00:59:55,680
You've become such a stubborn child.

729
00:59:56,025 --> 00:59:57,150
Please father...

730
00:59:57,574 --> 00:59:58,574
I'm begging you!

731
00:59:58,795 --> 01:00:00,586
You must reconsider this wedding!

732
01:00:00,897 --> 01:00:02,165
You can't let that lowborn

733
01:00:02,189 --> 01:00:03,889
human filth join our family!

734
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:05,568
Can't I?

735
01:00:05,692 --> 01:00:07,211
My life has lasted eons

736
01:00:07,211 --> 01:00:09,103
and if taking her gives me pleasure

737
01:00:09,103 --> 01:00:10,358
I shall do so.

738
01:00:11,006 --> 01:00:13,697
But do not mistake this
for anything permanent.

739
01:00:14,276 --> 01:00:16,744
This girl is but a plaything
for my entertainment.

740
01:00:17,213 --> 01:00:19,204
One that I will use and discard.

741
01:00:19,815 --> 01:00:22,978
Father, can't you see how
dangerous this creature is!?

742
01:00:23,419 --> 01:00:25,114
The whole family is at risk!

743
01:00:25,521 --> 01:00:26,918
Foolish girl!

744
01:00:27,056 --> 01:00:28,648
Taking one human into our fold

745
01:00:28,648 --> 01:00:30,448
is hardly enough to cause the fall

746
01:00:30,448 --> 01:00:31,948
of the house of Lee.

747
01:00:32,528 --> 01:00:33,821
For if it were...

748
01:00:34,145 --> 01:00:36,645
it would have fallen
when I took your mother.

749
01:00:37,933 --> 01:00:41,792
The lowly human whose
blood runs in your veins.

750
01:00:43,372 --> 01:00:45,866
I have lived in this world for ten thousand years

751
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:49,209
and you lack the capacity to understand
what that truly means.

752
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:51,646
When years cease to have meaning

753
01:00:51,770 --> 01:00:53,625
boredom is a mortal foe.

754
01:00:53,949 --> 01:00:56,217
It is a war for constant stimulation

755
01:00:56,452 --> 01:00:58,582
and if that means debasing our line with humans

756
01:00:58,906 --> 01:01:00,206
then so be it.

757
01:01:01,523 --> 01:01:02,584
And after all...

758
01:01:02,708 --> 01:01:04,308
since we took control of their lands

759
01:01:04,432 --> 01:01:06,932
the humans owe us something
in exchange for the simple

760
01:01:06,932 --> 01:01:09,130
existences our efforts allow them.

761
01:01:10,666 --> 01:01:11,894
When you consider that...

762
01:01:11,967 --> 01:01:14,959
a human female every fifty
years or so is nothing.

763
01:01:15,504 --> 01:01:18,498
Father, I demand you
take back that falsehood!

764
01:01:18,908 --> 01:01:20,341
But it's all true my dear.

765
01:01:20,709 --> 01:01:22,500
Your mother was human.

766
01:01:22,724 --> 01:01:23,724
No!

767
01:01:28,618 --> 01:01:29,781
Ironic isn't it?

768
01:01:30,105 --> 01:01:32,805
All the pride of a true noble
despite your parentage.

769
01:01:34,191 --> 01:01:36,789
However, as I can't allow your
tantrums to disturb my wedding,

770
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:39,494
I shall leave you here
until your temper has abated.

771
01:01:41,763 --> 01:01:42,889
My lord...

772
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:45,023
I would ask you to fulfill your promise.

773
01:01:46,235 --> 01:01:47,561
What promise is that?

774
01:01:48,036 --> 01:01:51,403
The gift of immortality and
eternal youth, as you promised.

775
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:54,304
To the contrary, you should
be grateful I let you live.

776
01:01:54,676 --> 01:01:57,201
Eternal youth for your repeated failures.

777
01:01:57,946 --> 01:02:00,037
I suggest you wait another fifty years

778
01:02:00,155 --> 01:02:02,146
before you dare ask me that again.

779
01:02:02,170 --> 01:02:04,270
You sniveling mutant fool.

780
01:02:06,021 --> 01:02:07,215
Fifty years?!

781
01:02:13,562 --> 01:02:14,793
Here...we go.

782
01:02:15,217 --> 01:02:17,717
I swear, this guy is such a handful.

783
01:02:28,941 --> 01:02:30,141
Uh-oh.

784
01:02:35,984 --> 01:02:37,611
Damn!
Gotta move!

785
01:03:17,003 --> 01:03:18,403
Not good!

786
01:03:19,628 --> 01:03:21,753
Come on, time to wake up already!

787
01:03:23,366 --> 01:03:24,630
Get a grip D!

788
01:03:25,054 --> 01:03:26,054
Snap out of it!

789
01:03:26,336 --> 01:03:27,367
Here it comes.

790
01:03:27,491 --> 01:03:28,391
It's spotted us!

791
01:03:28,515 --> 01:03:29,448
Wakey wakey!

792
01:03:29,449 --> 01:03:30,248
Rise and shine!

793
01:03:31,072 --> 01:03:33,470
Just move, damn it!

794
01:03:33,809 --> 01:03:35,604
Now's not the time to sleep in!

795
01:03:36,378 --> 01:03:37,869
Wake...up!

796
01:03:38,147 --> 01:03:40,008
You big lummox!

797
01:03:40,449 --> 01:03:42,882
Come on! Move...move damn it!

798
01:03:42,906 --> 01:03:44,106
Moooove!

799
01:03:53,462 --> 01:03:56,053
Well, we made it through that one somehow.

800
01:04:23,304 --> 01:04:24,204
Sis.

801
01:04:28,329 --> 01:04:29,193
Right.

802
01:04:41,376 --> 01:04:42,340
Okay Sis.

803
01:04:46,314 --> 01:04:47,281
Doris!!

804
01:05:26,388 --> 01:05:28,286
Rei, stand aside.

805
01:05:28,410 --> 01:05:29,510
Or die.

806
01:05:30,258 --> 01:05:32,317
Your days are over Count Lee.

807
01:05:44,406 --> 01:05:46,267
Wait fifty years you said.

808
01:05:46,591 --> 01:05:49,191
Do you even remember
what fifty years is to us?

809
01:05:49,510 --> 01:05:51,468
I lost my left hand because of you,

810
01:05:51,892 --> 01:05:53,491
I watched all my comrades die

811
01:05:53,715 --> 01:05:54,748
and for what?

812
01:05:54,972 --> 01:05:56,572
But all that ends here and now!

813
01:05:56,896 --> 01:05:58,796
You're going to die Count Lee!

814
01:06:03,225 --> 01:06:06,719
Did you really think that
would work on me, you fool?

815
01:06:19,841 --> 01:06:21,308
Good-bye Rei.

816
01:06:28,016 --> 01:06:30,707
My, this day is turning out to be filled

817
01:06:30,707 --> 01:06:32,907
with more wonderfully delightful diversions

818
01:06:32,907 --> 01:06:34,707
than I'd ever dared to hope for.

819
01:06:35,655 --> 01:06:36,955
How invigorating!

820
01:06:46,132 --> 01:06:49,204
We congratulate

821
01:06:49,528 --> 01:06:52,528
Count Magnus Lee

822
01:06:52,752 --> 01:06:54,752
on taking his bride.

823
01:06:55,811 --> 01:06:57,904
My bride and I thank you.

824
01:07:07,622 --> 01:07:11,080
No female has ever caused
me so much trouble before.

825
01:07:28,109 --> 01:07:29,235
Oh you.

826
01:07:33,982 --> 01:07:36,109
You may call yourself nobility, but...

827
01:07:36,518 --> 01:07:38,382
the real nobles died long ago.

828
01:07:38,606 --> 01:07:40,564
In this world you are just transient guests.

829
01:07:40,788 --> 01:07:41,946
Transient guests?

830
01:07:42,357 --> 01:07:43,220
That's right!

831
01:07:43,444 --> 01:07:45,044
The nobility in this castle are ghosts

832
01:07:45,068 --> 01:07:46,204
forgotten by time.

833
01:07:46,228 --> 01:07:48,328
It's time to return to the
world where you belong!

834
01:07:49,798 --> 01:07:51,698
You never cease to amuse me.

835
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,094
You're a dhampir,

836
01:07:53,218 --> 01:07:55,318
the product of some vampire's straying loins.

837
01:07:56,003 --> 01:07:57,967
You think you can defeat me mongrel?

838
01:07:58,673 --> 01:07:59,801
I'll finish you off,

839
01:07:59,825 --> 01:08:01,825
and then have the girl as my main course.

840
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:28,327
Oh how pathetic you are!

841
01:08:28,737 --> 01:08:30,371
One should know ones limits dhampir.

842
01:08:30,895 --> 01:08:32,495
I can't imagine what you thought

843
01:08:32,519 --> 01:08:33,885
hunting one such as I, but

844
01:08:34,309 --> 01:08:36,877
you are no match for true nobility.

845
01:08:37,512 --> 01:08:38,509
But wait...

846
01:08:38,633 --> 01:08:41,933
it would be too dull to dispatch
you in the same manner as Rei.

847
01:08:42,757 --> 01:08:43,757
Ah yes...

848
01:08:47,288 --> 01:08:50,556
I don't know how many
you've put down with this blade...

849
01:08:50,692 --> 01:08:53,988
but its steel is certainly accustomed
to killing your own kind.

850
01:08:55,529 --> 01:08:59,257
And it's only fitting that you
die by your own sword.

851
01:09:02,504 --> 01:09:03,501
It can't be!

852
01:09:03,625 --> 01:09:04,925
What are you?

853
01:09:52,821 --> 01:09:53,617
No Sis!

854
01:09:53,755 --> 01:09:54,753
Don't do it!! Stop!

855
01:09:56,658 --> 01:09:57,454
Dan?

856
01:09:59,728 --> 01:10:00,591
Doris!

857
01:10:01,015 --> 01:10:02,215
Hang on Sis.

858
01:10:04,766 --> 01:10:06,832
La...L'armica, what are you doing?

859
01:10:06,956 --> 01:10:09,056
Strike them down! I command you!

860
01:10:09,404 --> 01:10:11,466
Father, you must end this madness, now!

861
01:10:12,390 --> 01:10:14,390
Or our family will die.

862
01:10:14,709 --> 01:10:15,869
W...what?!

863
01:10:17,444 --> 01:10:21,140
Desire for this girl has made
you forget the pride of nobility.

864
01:10:21,917 --> 01:10:23,043
F...foolish child!

865
01:10:40,368 --> 01:10:41,596
No...it can't be!

866
01:10:43,138 --> 01:10:44,264
You...

867
01:10:44,539 --> 01:10:47,905
...the offspring of our sacred ancestor?!

868
01:10:56,484 --> 01:10:57,318
D...

869
01:10:58,342 --> 01:10:59,342
...ancestor...

870
01:11:00,166 --> 01:11:02,366
...shall I stay and die here with my father?

871
01:11:03,091 --> 01:11:03,922
I'm a man.

872
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:05,688
Not your sacred ancestor.

873
01:11:06,028 --> 01:11:07,196
I am a noble...

874
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:09,520
...and if our sacred ancestor
says we must die,

875
01:11:09,797 --> 01:11:11,526
then it is my duty to obey.

876
01:11:12,901 --> 01:11:15,769
No, human blood flows in
your veins as it does mine.

877
01:11:16,271 --> 01:11:18,205
As a dhampir you can make your own choice.

878
01:11:18,673 --> 01:11:21,267
To live without the trappings
and flawed rules of the nobility.

879
01:11:21,643 --> 01:11:22,707
But I...

880
01:11:23,331 --> 01:11:24,631
...I am a pure noble!

881
01:11:24,913 --> 01:11:26,904
My blood pure and unpoluted.

882
01:11:33,021 --> 01:11:33,749
D!

883
01:11:34,155 --> 01:11:35,247
Mr. D!

884
01:11:35,590 --> 01:11:37,581
I am a noble, this is my fate!

885
01:14:29,364 --> 01:14:30,092
Hey D!

886
01:14:30,499 --> 01:14:31,461
Mr. D!

887
01:14:31,485 --> 01:14:32,285
D!

888
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:34,397
Mr. D!

889
01:14:34,421 --> 01:14:35,313
D!

890
01:14:36,137 --> 01:14:37,001
Mr. D!

891
01:14:37,025 --> 01:14:37,882
D!

892
01:14:38,606 --> 01:14:39,532
D!

893
01:14:39,774 --> 01:14:40,604
D!!

894
01:14:42,877 --> 01:14:44,071
D!

895
01:14:44,645 --> 01:14:45,770
Mr. D!!!

896
01:14:46,214 --> 01:14:47,408
D!!!

897
01:14:47,448 --> 01:14:49,142
D!

898
01:14:51,387 --> 01:14:52,547
Bye!

899
01:14:53,521 --> 01:14:54,519
Good-bye D!!!

900
01:14:55,043 --> 01:14:56,643
We love you!!

901
01:14:57,305 --> 01:15:57,805
