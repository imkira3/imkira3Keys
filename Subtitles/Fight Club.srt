00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:08,018
<i>People always ask me
if I know Tyler Durden.</i>

3
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:09,986
Three minutes.

4
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:12,395
This is it. Ground zero.

5
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:16,163
Do you have a speech for the occasion?

6
00:02:16,237 --> 00:02:19,797
<i>With a gun barrel between your teeth,
you speak only in vowels.</i>

7
00:02:19,872 --> 00:02:21,965
I can't think of anything.

8
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:25,910
<i>For a second, I forget about
Tyler's controlled demolition thing</i>

9
00:02:26,013 --> 00:02:28,173
<i>and I wonder how clean that gun is.</i>

10
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:30,307
It's getting exciting now.

11
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:33,580
<i>That old thing,
how you always hurt the one you love.</i>

12
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:35,780
<i>Well, it works both ways.</i>

13
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:40,122
<i>We have front-row seats
for this theater of mass destruction.</i>

14
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:42,991
<i>The Demolitions Committee
of Project Mayhem</i>

15
00:02:43,063 --> 00:02:46,500
<i>wrapped the foundations
of 12 buildings with explosives.</i>

16
00:02:47,269 --> 00:02:50,669
<i>In two minutes,
primary charges will blow base charges</i>

17
00:02:50,738 --> 00:02:54,106
<i>and a few blocks will be reduced
to smouldering rubble.</i>

18
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:57,235
<i>I know this because Tyler knows this.</i>

19
00:02:57,312 --> 00:03:00,714
Two and a half.
Think of everything we've accomplished.

20
00:03:00,816 --> 00:03:06,151
<i>Suddenly I realize that all of this,
the gun, the bombs, the revolution,</i>

21
00:03:06,254 --> 00:03:09,520
<i>has got something to do
with a girl named Marla Singer.</i>

22
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,426
<i>Bob. Bob had bitch tits.</i>

23
00:03:14,496 --> 00:03:18,695
<i>This was a support group
for men with testicular cancer.</i>

24
00:03:18,768 --> 00:03:22,067
<i>The big moosie slobbering all over me,
that was Bob.</i>

25
00:03:22,138 --> 00:03:24,299
We're still men.

26
00:03:24,373 --> 00:03:26,568
Yes, we're men.

27
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:28,870
Men is what we are.

28
00:03:28,944 --> 00:03:32,381
<i>Bob had had his testicles removed.
Then hormone therapy.</i>

29
00:03:32,482 --> 00:03:36,281
<i>He developed bitch tits because
his testosterone was too high</i>

30
00:03:36,352 --> 00:03:38,480
<i>and his body upped the oestrogen.</i>

31
00:03:38,555 --> 00:03:42,286
<i>- That was where I fit...
- They'll have to drain my pecs again.</i>

32
00:03:42,359 --> 00:03:44,851
<i>..between those huge sweating tits</i>

33
00:03:44,929 --> 00:03:49,160
<i>that hung enormous,
the way you'd think of God's as big.</i>

34
00:03:49,266 --> 00:03:51,461
OK, you cry now.

35
00:03:51,535 --> 00:03:54,096
<i>No, wait. Back up. Let me start earlier.</i>

36
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:58,103
<i>For six months, I couldn't sleep.</i>

37
00:03:58,175 --> 00:04:00,736
<i>I couldn't sleep.</i>

38
00:04:00,812 --> 00:04:02,973
<i>With insomnia, nothing's real.</i>

39
00:04:03,081 --> 00:04:05,140
<i>Everything's far away.</i>

40
00:04:06,084 --> 00:04:08,416
<i>Everything's a copy of a copy</i>

41
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:10,544
<i>of a copy.</i>

42
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:18,419
<i>When deep space exploration ramps up,
it'll be the corporations that name everything.</i>

43
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:20,588
<i>The IBM Stellar Sphere.</i>

44
00:04:20,932 --> 00:04:22,992
<i>The Microsoft Galaxy.</i>

45
00:04:23,102 --> 00:04:25,161
<i>The Planet Starbucks.</i>

46
00:04:25,738 --> 00:04:28,799
I need you out of town this week
to cover some red flags.

47
00:04:28,907 --> 00:04:32,434
<i>It must have been Tuesday.
He had on his cornflower blue tie.</i>

48
00:04:32,544 --> 00:04:37,141
You want me to deprioritize my reports
until you advise of a status upgrade?

49
00:04:37,217 --> 00:04:41,812
Prioritize these. Here's your flight coupons.
Call me if there's any snags.

50
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,789
<i>He was full of pep.
Must have had his grande latte enema.</i>

51
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:52,025
<i>Like so many others, I had become
a slave to the Ikea nesting instinct.</i>

52
00:04:52,132 --> 00:04:54,464
Yes. I'd like to order

53
00:04:54,567 --> 00:04:56,831
the Erika Pekkari dust ruffles.

54
00:04:56,936 --> 00:04:59,030
<i>- Please hold.
- Anything clever,</i>

55
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:03,473
<i>like a coffee table in the shape of a yin-yang,
I had to have it.</i>

56
00:05:04,544 --> 00:05:06,945
<i>The Klipsk personal office unit.</i>

57
00:05:07,014 --> 00:05:09,278
<i>The Hovetrekke home exerbike.</i>

58
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:13,211
<i>Or the Ohamshab sofa
with the Strinne green stripe pattern.</i>

59
00:05:13,287 --> 00:05:18,782
<i>Even the Ryslampa wire lamps of
environmentally-friendly unbleached paper.</i>

60
00:05:18,859 --> 00:05:21,658
<i>I'd flip through catalogues and wonder</i>

61
00:05:21,797 --> 00:05:24,822
<i>"What kind of dining set
defines me as a person?"</i>

62
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:29,667
<i>I had it all. Even the glass dishes
with tiny bubbles and imperfections,</i>

63
00:05:29,805 --> 00:05:34,868
<i>proof that they were crafted by the honest,
hard-working, indigenous peoples of...</i>

64
00:05:34,976 --> 00:05:37,911
<i>- Please hold.
- ..wherever.</i>

65
00:05:38,413 --> 00:05:40,506
<i>We used to read pornography.</i>

66
00:05:40,615 --> 00:05:43,449
<i>Now it was the Horchow collection.</i>

67
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:46,919
- No. You can't die of insomnia.
- What about narcolepsy?

68
00:05:47,022 --> 00:05:49,389
I nod off, I wake up in strange places.

69
00:05:49,459 --> 00:05:51,518
I have no idea how I got there.

70
00:05:51,627 --> 00:05:55,427
- You need to lighten up.
- Can you please just give me something?

71
00:05:55,498 --> 00:05:59,127
<i>Red and blue Tuinals, lipstick-red Seconals...</i>

72
00:05:59,535 --> 00:06:02,993
No. You need healthy, natural sleep.

73
00:06:03,706 --> 00:06:07,199
Chew some valerian root
and get more exercise.

74
00:06:09,245 --> 00:06:11,305
Hey, come on.

75
00:06:11,415 --> 00:06:13,474
- I'm in pain.
- You wanna see pain?

76
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:16,110
Swing by First Methodist, Tuesday nights.

77
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:19,280
See the guys with testicular cancer.

78
00:06:19,356 --> 00:06:21,449
That's pain.

79
00:06:37,342 --> 00:06:40,743
I always wanted three kids...
two boys and a girl.

80
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:43,245
Mindy wanted two girls and a boy.

81
00:06:44,849 --> 00:06:47,317
We never could agree on anything.

82
00:06:47,652 --> 00:06:49,450
Well, I... She...

83
00:06:49,522 --> 00:06:52,046
She had her first child last week.

84
00:06:52,123 --> 00:06:54,353
A girl.

85
00:06:54,459 --> 00:06:57,691
With... With her... With her new husband.

86
00:06:58,531 --> 00:07:00,590
Fuck!

87
00:07:01,934 --> 00:07:03,993
Thank God, you know...

88
00:07:04,103 --> 00:07:06,162
I'm glad for her.

89
00:07:06,972 --> 00:07:09,942
She deserves...

90
00:07:13,746 --> 00:07:17,581
Everyone, let's thank Thomas
for sharing himself with us.

91
00:07:17,684 --> 00:07:19,743
Thank you, Thomas.

92
00:07:19,886 --> 00:07:23,322
I look around this room,
and I see a lot of courage.

93
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:25,483
And that gives me strength.

94
00:07:25,559 --> 00:07:27,925
We give each other strength.

95
00:07:27,994 --> 00:07:30,292
It's time for the one-on-ones.

96
00:07:30,897 --> 00:07:35,301
So let's all of us follow Thomas's example
and really open ourselves up.

97
00:07:35,368 --> 00:07:37,427
Could you find a partner?

98
00:07:39,607 --> 00:07:42,770
<i>And this is how I met the big moosie.</i>

99
00:07:44,445 --> 00:07:47,642
<i>His eyes already shrink-wrapped in tears.</i>

100
00:07:50,151 --> 00:07:52,949
<i>Knees together. Those awkward little steps.</i>

101
00:07:58,159 --> 00:08:00,252
- My name is Bob.
- Bob?

102
00:08:00,962 --> 00:08:03,227
<i>Bob had been a champion bodybuilder.</i>

103
00:08:03,332 --> 00:08:06,995
<i>You know that chest expansion programme
on late-night TV?</i>

104
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:09,162
<i>That was his idea.</i>

105
00:08:09,237 --> 00:08:11,330
I was a juicer.

106
00:08:11,406 --> 00:08:13,533
You know, using steroids?

107
00:08:13,609 --> 00:08:16,135
Diabonal and

108
00:08:16,212 --> 00:08:18,544
Wisterol.

109
00:08:18,615 --> 00:08:22,550
Oh, they use that on racehorses,
for Christ sakes.

110
00:08:23,051 --> 00:08:25,145
And now I'm bankrupt.

111
00:08:26,022 --> 00:08:28,081
I'm divorced.

112
00:08:28,825 --> 00:08:30,952
My two grown kids

113
00:08:31,794 --> 00:08:34,456
won't even return my phone calls.

114
00:08:34,564 --> 00:08:39,628
<i>Strangers with this kind of honesty
make me go a big, rubbery one.</i>

115
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:43,496
Go ahead,... Cornelius.

116
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,666
You can cry.

117
00:09:01,426 --> 00:09:04,861
<i>And then... something happened.
I let go.</i>

118
00:09:04,995 --> 00:09:07,054
That's really good.

119
00:09:07,131 --> 00:09:09,225
<i>Lost in oblivion.</i>

120
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,598
<i>Dark and silent and complete.</i>

121
00:09:14,605 --> 00:09:18,303
<i>I found freedom.
Losing all hope was freedom.</i>

122
00:09:20,745 --> 00:09:22,839
It's OK.

123
00:09:25,116 --> 00:09:27,311
<i>Babies don't sleep this well.</i>

124
00:09:30,923 --> 00:09:33,517
<i>I became addicted.</i>

125
00:09:47,239 --> 00:09:49,298
If I didn't say anything

126
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:52,072
people always assumed the worst.

127
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:58,976
They cried harder... then I cried harder.

128
00:10:08,396 --> 00:10:12,559
Now we're going to open the green door,
the heart chakra...

129
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:14,726
<i>I wasn't really dying.</i>

130
00:10:14,869 --> 00:10:17,599
<i>I wasn't host to cancer or parasites.</i>

131
00:10:18,539 --> 00:10:22,407
<i>I was the warm little center
that the life of this world crowded around.</i>

132
00:10:23,411 --> 00:10:26,380
Imagine your pain
as a white ball of healing light.

133
00:10:26,481 --> 00:10:30,578
It moves over your body, healing you.

134
00:10:30,686 --> 00:10:34,177
Now keep this going. Remember to breathe

135
00:10:34,288 --> 00:10:37,952
and step forward
through the back door of the room.

136
00:10:38,794 --> 00:10:40,921
Where does it lead?

137
00:10:41,029 --> 00:10:43,156
To your cave.

138
00:10:43,232 --> 00:10:45,132
Step forward

139
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,395
into your cave.

140
00:10:47,503 --> 00:10:49,562
That's right.

141
00:10:49,638 --> 00:10:53,130
You're going deeper into your cave.

142
00:10:53,809 --> 00:10:55,902
And you're going to find

143
00:10:55,978 --> 00:10:58,106
your power animal.

144
00:11:00,216 --> 00:11:01,547
Slide.

145
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,723
<i>Every evening I died.</i>

146
00:11:15,865 --> 00:11:18,561
<i>And every evening I was born again.</i>

147
00:11:19,169 --> 00:11:21,229
<i>Resurrected.</i>

148
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:27,472
<i>Bob loved me because he thought
my testicles were removed too.</i>

149
00:11:27,578 --> 00:11:30,376
<i>Being there, pressed against his tits,</i>

150
00:11:30,447 --> 00:11:32,540
<i>ready to cry.</i>

151
00:11:32,616 --> 00:11:35,279
<i>This was my vacation.</i>

152
00:11:37,588 --> 00:11:39,215
<i>And she</i>

153
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:41,953
<i>ruined everything.</i>

154
00:11:42,027 --> 00:11:44,154
This is cancer, right?

155
00:11:47,032 --> 00:11:49,262
<i>This chick, Marla Singer,</i>

156
00:11:49,367 --> 00:11:51,995
<i>did not have testicular cancer.</i>

157
00:11:52,103 --> 00:11:54,196
<i>She was a liar.</i>

158
00:11:54,272 --> 00:11:56,365
<i>She had no diseases at all.</i>

159
00:11:56,442 --> 00:12:00,241
<i>I had seen her at Free And Clear,
my blood parasites group, Thursdays.</i>

160
00:12:00,312 --> 00:12:03,771
<i>Then at Hope,
my bimonthly sickle-cell circle.</i>

161
00:12:04,283 --> 00:12:09,243
<i>And again, at Seize The Day,
my tuberculosis, Friday night.</i>

162
00:12:10,388 --> 00:12:12,380
<i>Marla,</i>

163
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:14,926
<i>the big tourist.</i>

164
00:12:15,027 --> 00:12:17,120
<i>Her lie reflected my lie.</i>

165
00:12:17,663 --> 00:12:19,723
<i>And suddenly, I felt nothing.</i>

166
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:23,461
<i>I couldn't cry. So once again,</i>

167
00:12:23,536 --> 00:12:25,629
<i>I couldn't sleep.</i>

168
00:12:36,617 --> 00:12:39,085
<i>Next group, after guided meditation,</i>

169
00:12:39,219 --> 00:12:42,620
<i>after we open our heart chakras,
when it's time to hug,</i>

170
00:12:42,689 --> 00:12:45,852
<i>I'm gonna grab that bitch,
Marla Singer, and scream.</i>

171
00:12:45,926 --> 00:12:49,920
Marla, you liar!
You big tourist, I need this! Now, get out!

172
00:12:52,033 --> 00:12:54,432
<i>I hadn't slept in four days.</i>

173
00:12:54,501 --> 00:12:56,367
<i>We'll just let that dry...</i>

174
00:12:56,471 --> 00:12:59,907
<i>When you have insomnia,
you're never really asleep.</i>

175
00:12:59,974 --> 00:13:02,465
<i>And you're never really awake.</i>

176
00:13:03,646 --> 00:13:06,136
To begin tonight's communion,

177
00:13:06,247 --> 00:13:08,943
Chloe would like to say a few words.

178
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:11,985
<i>Oh, yeah. Chloe.</i>

179
00:13:12,888 --> 00:13:17,848
<i>Chloe looked the way Meryl Streep's skeleton
would look if you made it walk around</i>

180
00:13:17,927 --> 00:13:19,986
<i>being extra nice to everybody.</i>

181
00:13:20,496 --> 00:13:22,555
Well, I'm still here.

182
00:13:22,932 --> 00:13:25,060
But I don't know for how long.

183
00:13:25,902 --> 00:13:28,995
That's as much certainty
as anyone can give me.

184
00:13:29,104 --> 00:13:31,072
But I've got some good news.

185
00:13:31,173 --> 00:13:34,905
I no longer have any fear of death.

186
00:13:38,814 --> 00:13:42,581
But... I am in a pretty lonely place.

187
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,713
No-one will have sex with me.

188
00:13:46,891 --> 00:13:51,293
I'm so close to the end,
and all I want is to get laid for the last time.

189
00:13:51,895 --> 00:13:55,354
I have pornographic movies
in my apartment,

190
00:13:55,433 --> 00:13:59,130
- and lubricants and amyl nitrite.
- Thank you, Chloe.

191
00:13:59,836 --> 00:14:01,964
Everyone, let's thank Chloe.

192
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:04,200
Thank you, Chloe.

193
00:14:07,011 --> 00:14:10,845
Now, let's ready ourselves
for guided meditation.

194
00:14:11,983 --> 00:14:15,384
You're standing at the entrance of your cave.

195
00:14:15,853 --> 00:14:19,346
You step inside your cave and you walk...

196
00:14:19,424 --> 00:14:22,551
<i>If I did have a tumor, I'd name it Marla.</i>

197
00:14:23,595 --> 00:14:25,586
<i>Marla.</i>

198
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:30,124
<i>The scratch on the roof of your mouth
that would heal if you could stop tonguing it.</i>

199
00:14:30,235 --> 00:14:32,328
<i>But you can't.</i>

200
00:14:33,238 --> 00:14:36,071
<i>..deeper into your cave as you walk.</i>

201
00:14:36,174 --> 00:14:39,736
<i>You feel a healing energy all around you.</i>

202
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:44,440
<i>Now find your power animal.</i>

203
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:49,378
Slide.

204
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:56,295
OK. Let's partner up.

205
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,694
Pick someone special to you tonight.

206
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:06,997
Hey.

207
00:15:07,408 --> 00:15:09,467
- We need to talk.
- Sure.

208
00:15:14,281 --> 00:15:16,374
- I'm onto you.
- What?

209
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:19,578
Yeah. You're a faker. You're not dying.

210
00:15:19,653 --> 00:15:21,450
Sorry?

211
00:15:21,522 --> 00:15:26,517
In the Tibetan-philosophy, Sylvia-Plath
sense of the word, I know we're all dying.

212
00:15:26,628 --> 00:15:30,826
- But you're not dying the way Chloe is.
- So?

213
00:15:31,433 --> 00:15:33,492
So you're a tourist.

214
00:15:33,601 --> 00:15:37,800
I've seen you. I saw you at melanoma,
I saw you at tuberculosis.

215
00:15:37,873 --> 00:15:40,397
I saw you at testicular cancer!

216
00:15:40,475 --> 00:15:42,102
I saw you practising this.

217
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:44,645
- Practising what?
- Telling me off.

218
00:15:44,713 --> 00:15:48,547
Is it going as well as you hoped,... Rupert?

219
00:15:48,651 --> 00:15:50,447
I'll expose you.

220
00:15:50,518 --> 00:15:52,612
Go ahead. I'll expose you.

221
00:15:53,355 --> 00:15:56,222
Come together. Let yourselves cry.

222
00:16:03,232 --> 00:16:05,325
Oh, God. Why are you doing this?

223
00:16:05,434 --> 00:16:08,165
It's cheaper than a movie
and there's free coffee.

224
00:16:08,271 --> 00:16:11,034
Look, this is important.
These are my groups.

225
00:16:11,107 --> 00:16:13,234
I've been coming for over a year.

226
00:16:13,342 --> 00:16:16,540
- Why do you do it?
- I don't know.

227
00:16:16,646 --> 00:16:20,480
When people think you're dying,
they listen to you instead of...

228
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:23,542
Instead of waiting for their turn to speak.

229
00:16:24,855 --> 00:16:26,914
Yeah. Yeah.

230
00:16:28,091 --> 00:16:30,959
Share yourself... completely.

231
00:16:31,762 --> 00:16:33,854
Look, you don't want to get into this.

232
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:35,990
- It becomes an addiction.
- Really?

233
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:40,366
I'm not kidding. I can't cry
if another faker is present, and I need this.

234
00:16:40,471 --> 00:16:42,530
You gotta find somewhere else to go.

235
00:16:42,607 --> 00:16:46,168
Candystripe a cancer ward.
It's not my problem.

236
00:16:49,347 --> 00:16:51,407
No, wait a second. Hold on.

237
00:16:51,517 --> 00:16:53,576
We'll split up the week, OK?

238
00:16:53,685 --> 00:16:55,879
You take lymphoma and tuberculosis.

239
00:16:55,953 --> 00:16:59,082
You take tuberculosis.
My smoking doesn't go over at all.

240
00:16:59,158 --> 00:17:02,491
OK. Good. Fine.
Testicular cancer should be no contest.

241
00:17:02,561 --> 00:17:06,497
Technically, I have more right to be there.
You still have your balls.

242
00:17:06,565 --> 00:17:08,931
- You're kidding.
- I dunno. Am I?

243
00:17:09,601 --> 00:17:11,034
No. No.

244
00:17:11,136 --> 00:17:13,765
- What do you want?
- I'll take the parasites.

245
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,638
You can't have both.
Take the blood parasites.

246
00:17:16,743 --> 00:17:21,043
- I want brain parasites.
- I'll take the blood but I want brain dementia.

247
00:17:21,147 --> 00:17:23,911
- I want that.
- You can't have the whole brain.

248
00:17:23,983 --> 00:17:26,508
So far, you have four. I only have two.

249
00:17:26,586 --> 00:17:30,522
OK. Take both the parasites. They're yours.

250
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,854
Now we both have three...

251
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:38,224
Hey! You left half your clothes.

252
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,944
- What, are you selling those?
- Yes!

253
00:17:57,018 --> 00:17:59,077
I'm selling some clothes!

254
00:17:59,187 --> 00:18:01,245
So! We each have three. That's six.

255
00:18:01,355 --> 00:18:04,189
What about the seventh day?
I want bowel cancer.

256
00:18:04,259 --> 00:18:06,352
<i>The girl had done her homework.</i>

257
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:08,554
No. No. I want bowel cancer.

258
00:18:09,197 --> 00:18:11,257
That's your favorite too?

259
00:18:11,367 --> 00:18:14,858
- Tried to slip it by me, eh?
- Look, we'll split it.

260
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:17,029
Take the first and third Sunday.

261
00:18:19,508 --> 00:18:21,373
Deal.

262
00:18:23,979 --> 00:18:26,278
Looks like this is goodbye.

263
00:18:26,382 --> 00:18:28,509
Let's not make a big thing out of it.

264
00:18:28,618 --> 00:18:31,052
How's this for not making a big thing?

265
00:18:34,523 --> 00:18:36,320
Hey, Marla!

266
00:18:36,659 --> 00:18:38,820
Marla!

267
00:18:38,894 --> 00:18:41,489
Maybe we should exchange numbers.

268
00:18:41,598 --> 00:18:43,498
Should we?

269
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,660
- We might wanna switch nights.
- OK.

270
00:18:52,843 --> 00:18:55,335
<i>This is how I met Marla Singer.</i>

271
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:01,312
<i>Marla's philosophy of life
was that she might die at any moment.</i>

272
00:19:01,418 --> 00:19:03,717
<i>The tragedy, she said, was that she didn't.</i>

273
00:19:03,821 --> 00:19:07,847
It doesn't have your name!
Who are you? Cornelius? Rupert?

274
00:19:07,924 --> 00:19:11,884
Travis? Any of the stupid names
you give each night?

275
00:19:14,866 --> 00:19:16,925
<i>You wake up at SeaTac.</i>

276
00:19:17,035 --> 00:19:19,970
<i>SFO. LAX.</i>

277
00:19:20,071 --> 00:19:22,437
<i>You wake up at O'Hare.</i>

278
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,668
<i>Dallas Fort Worth.</i>

279
00:19:24,743 --> 00:19:26,711
<i>BWI.</i>

280
00:19:26,779 --> 00:19:30,578
<i>Pacific. Mountain. Central.
Lose an hour. Gain an hour.</i>

281
00:19:30,682 --> 00:19:34,551
The check-in for that flight
isn't for another two hours, sir.

282
00:19:34,653 --> 00:19:37,918
<i>This is your life,
and it's ending one minute at a time.</i>

283
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:40,982
<i>You wake up at Air Harbor International.</i>

284
00:19:42,394 --> 00:19:46,262
<i>If you wake up at a different time,
in a different place,</i>

285
00:19:46,332 --> 00:19:48,995
<i>could you wake up as a different person?</i>

286
00:19:49,102 --> 00:19:51,160
<i>Everywhere I travel,</i>

287
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:53,534
<i>tiny life.</i>

288
00:19:53,605 --> 00:19:56,131
<i>Single-serving sugar and cream.</i>

289
00:19:56,209 --> 00:19:58,006
<i>Single pat of butter.</i>

290
00:19:58,111 --> 00:20:00,944
<i>The microwave cordon bleu hobby kit.</i>

291
00:20:01,014 --> 00:20:02,982
<i>Shampoo-conditioner combos.</i>

292
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:06,951
<i>Sample-package mouthwash.
Tiny bars of soap.</i>

293
00:20:08,388 --> 00:20:10,914
<i>The people I meet on each flight,</i>

294
00:20:10,991 --> 00:20:13,117
<i>they're single-serving friends.</i>

295
00:20:13,193 --> 00:20:16,925
<i>Between takeoff and landing,
we have our time together.</i>

296
00:20:16,997 --> 00:20:19,227
<i>That's all we get.</i>

297
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:21,233
<i>Welcome!</i>

298
00:20:23,337 --> 00:20:27,535
<i>On a long enough time line,
the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.</i>

299
00:20:27,608 --> 00:20:31,340
<i>I was a recall coordinator.
My job was to apply the formula.</i>

300
00:20:31,413 --> 00:20:33,813
The infant went through the windshield.

301
00:20:33,915 --> 00:20:37,976
<i>A new car built by my company
leaves somewhere traveling at 60mph.</i>

302
00:20:38,053 --> 00:20:40,146
<i>The rear differential locks up.</i>

303
00:20:41,189 --> 00:20:43,783
The teenager's braces
are stuck to the ashtray.

304
00:20:43,859 --> 00:20:46,225
Might make a good anti-smoking ad.

305
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:49,820
<i>The car crashes and burns
with everyone trapped inside.</i>

306
00:20:49,931 --> 00:20:52,195
<i>Now, should we initiate a recall?</i>

307
00:20:52,267 --> 00:20:54,361
The father must have been huge.

308
00:20:54,437 --> 00:20:57,667
See where the fat burned to the seat?
The polyester shirt?

309
00:20:57,773 --> 00:20:59,764
Very modern art.

310
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:02,333
<i>Take the number of vehicles in the field, A.</i>

311
00:21:02,412 --> 00:21:05,142
<i>Multiply it by the probable rate of failure, B.</i>

312
00:21:05,214 --> 00:21:09,014
<i>Multiply the result by
the average out-of-court settlement, C.</i>

313
00:21:09,085 --> 00:21:11,178
<i>A x B x C</i>

314
00:21:11,387 --> 00:21:13,287
equals X.

315
00:21:13,389 --> 00:21:15,984
If X is less than the cost of a recall,

316
00:21:16,059 --> 00:21:18,084
we don't do one.

317
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:21,391
Are there a lot of these kinds of accidents?

318
00:21:21,464 --> 00:21:23,399
You wouldn't believe.

319
00:21:24,868 --> 00:21:27,393
Which car company do you work for?

320
00:21:27,471 --> 00:21:29,598
A major one.

321
00:21:32,075 --> 00:21:36,011
<i>Every time the plane banked too sharply
on takeoff or landing,</i>

322
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:39,379
<i>I prayed for a crash or a midair collision.</i>

323
00:21:40,051 --> 00:21:41,608
<i>Anything.</i>

324
00:21:50,462 --> 00:21:54,193
<i>Life insurance pays off triple
if you die on a business trip.</i>

325
00:21:57,135 --> 00:22:00,435
"If you are seated in an emergency exit row

326
00:22:00,506 --> 00:22:04,032
and would be unable or unwilling
to perform the duties

327
00:22:04,108 --> 00:22:08,546
listed on the safety card, please
ask a flight attendant to reseat you."

328
00:22:10,349 --> 00:22:12,408
It's a lot of responsibility.

329
00:22:12,485 --> 00:22:14,715
Wanna switch seats?

330
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:18,256
No. I'm not sure
I'm the man for that particularjob.

331
00:22:18,324 --> 00:22:22,728
An exit-door procedure at 30,000ft.

332
00:22:22,829 --> 00:22:24,887
The illusion of safety.

333
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:27,223
Yeah. I guess so.

334
00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:30,235
You know why
they put oxygen masks on planes?

335
00:22:30,303 --> 00:22:34,865
- So you can breathe.
- Oxygen gets you high.

336
00:22:35,976 --> 00:22:39,503
In a catastrophic emergency,
you take giant panic breaths.

337
00:22:39,579 --> 00:22:42,104
Suddenly you become euphoric, docile.

338
00:22:42,182 --> 00:22:44,481
You accept your fate.

339
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:47,143
It's all right here.

340
00:22:47,254 --> 00:22:50,383
Emergency water landing, 600mph.

341
00:22:50,491 --> 00:22:53,324
Blank faces. Calm as Hindu cows.

342
00:22:53,394 --> 00:22:55,487
That's...

343
00:22:56,731 --> 00:22:58,995
That's an interesting theory.

344
00:23:01,002 --> 00:23:03,129
- What do you do?
- What do you mean?

345
00:23:03,204 --> 00:23:05,298
What do you do for a living?

346
00:23:05,374 --> 00:23:08,536
Why? So you can pretend you're interested?

347
00:23:11,212 --> 00:23:12,703
OK.

348
00:23:12,781 --> 00:23:15,682
You have
a kind of sick desperation in your laugh.

349
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,980
We have the exact same briefcase.

350
00:23:21,823 --> 00:23:23,814
Soap.

351
00:23:23,926 --> 00:23:27,590
- Sorry?
- I make and I sell soap.

352
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:30,095
The yardstick of civilization.

353
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:32,567
<i>And this is how I met...</i>

354
00:23:32,701 --> 00:23:34,499
Tyler Durden.

355
00:23:34,571 --> 00:23:39,838
Did you know if you mix gasoline and
frozen orange juice, you can make napalm?

356
00:23:39,943 --> 00:23:42,912
- No, I did not. Is that true?
- That's right.

357
00:23:42,979 --> 00:23:46,813
One can make all kinds of explosives
with simple household items.

358
00:23:46,916 --> 00:23:49,351
- Really?
- If one was so inclined.

359
00:23:54,324 --> 00:23:59,388
Tyler, you are by far the most interesting
single-serving friend I have ever met.

360
00:24:01,265 --> 00:24:05,395
- Everything on a plane is single-serving...
- Oh, I get it. Very clever.

361
00:24:05,469 --> 00:24:07,027
Thank you.

362
00:24:07,137 --> 00:24:09,230
How's it working out for you?

363
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:12,071
- What?
- Being clever?

364
00:24:12,177 --> 00:24:14,542
Great.

365
00:24:14,612 --> 00:24:17,604
Keep it up, then. Right up.

366
00:24:18,817 --> 00:24:20,978
A question of etiquette.

367
00:24:21,052 --> 00:24:24,044
As I pass, do I give you the ass or the crotch?

368
00:24:31,096 --> 00:24:33,429
<i>How I came to live with Tyler is...</i>

369
00:24:33,499 --> 00:24:37,798
<i>Airlines have this policy
about vibrating luggage.</i>

370
00:24:45,478 --> 00:24:50,108
- Was it ticking?
- Throwers know modern bombs don't tick.

371
00:24:50,216 --> 00:24:53,379
- Sorry, throwers?
- Baggage handlers.

372
00:24:53,452 --> 00:24:55,683
But when a suitcase vibrates,

373
00:24:55,822 --> 00:24:58,483
the throwers have got to call the police.

374
00:24:58,591 --> 00:25:02,083
- My suitcase was vibrating?
- Nine times out of ten

375
00:25:02,194 --> 00:25:04,254
it's an electric razor.

376
00:25:04,331 --> 00:25:06,458
But... every once in a while

377
00:25:09,402 --> 00:25:11,462
it's a dildo.

378
00:25:12,239 --> 00:25:16,300
It's company policy never to imply
ownership in the event of a dildo.

379
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:20,278
<i>We have to use the indefinite article,
a dildo, never</i>

380
00:25:20,347 --> 00:25:22,440
<i>your dildo.</i>

381
00:25:22,516 --> 00:25:24,610
I don't own...

382
00:25:27,288 --> 00:25:30,416
<i>I had everything in that suitcase.
My CK shirts.</i>

383
00:25:30,491 --> 00:25:33,654
<i>My DKNYshoes. My AX ties.</i>

384
00:25:35,329 --> 00:25:37,661
<i>Never mind.</i>

385
00:25:39,535 --> 00:25:42,264
Hey! That's my car!

386
00:25:48,577 --> 00:25:50,545
<i>Home was a condo on the 15th floor</i>

387
00:25:50,646 --> 00:25:53,671
<i>of a filing cabinet
for widows and professionals.</i>

388
00:25:53,748 --> 00:25:56,377
<i>The walls were solid concrete.</i>

389
00:25:56,485 --> 00:25:58,544
<i>A foot of concrete is important</i>

390
00:25:58,654 --> 00:26:02,921
<i>when your next-door neighbor
has to watch game shows at full volume.</i>

391
00:26:02,992 --> 00:26:06,893
<i>Or when a blast of debris
that used to be your personal effects</i>

392
00:26:06,962 --> 00:26:10,990
<i>blows out of your windows
and sails flaming into the night.</i>

393
00:26:17,474 --> 00:26:19,738
<i>I suppose these things happen.</i>

394
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:34,683
There's... nothing up there.

395
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:38,160
You can't go into the unit. Police orders.

396
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:49,362
Do you have somebody you can call?

397
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,567
<i>How embarrassing.</i>

398
00:26:51,642 --> 00:26:54,544
<i>A houseful of condiments and no food.</i>

399
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:07,756
<i>The police later told me
the pilot light might have gone out</i>

400
00:27:08,761 --> 00:27:11,729
<i>letting out just a little bit of gas.</i>

401
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:14,061
<i>That gas could have filled the condo.</i>

402
00:27:14,166 --> 00:27:17,659
<i>1700 square feet with high ceilings
for days and days.</i>

403
00:27:25,878 --> 00:27:29,645
<i>Then the refrigerator's compressor
could have clicked on.</i>

404
00:27:30,751 --> 00:27:32,809
<i>Yeah?</i>

405
00:27:35,955 --> 00:27:38,015
<i>I can hear you breathing...</i>

406
00:27:46,667 --> 00:27:50,603
<i>If you ask me now,
I couldn't tell you why I called him.</i>

407
00:28:33,849 --> 00:28:36,080
<i>- Hello?
- Who's this?</i>

408
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,413
<i>- Tyler?
- Who is this?</i>

409
00:28:41,957 --> 00:28:44,153
We met... We met on the airplane.

410
00:28:44,261 --> 00:28:46,491
We had the same suitcase?

411
00:28:46,563 --> 00:28:48,655
The clever guy?

412
00:28:48,731 --> 00:28:51,098
<i>Oh, yeah. Right.</i>

413
00:28:53,103 --> 00:28:55,731
I called a second ago. There was no answer.

414
00:28:55,839 --> 00:29:00,037
<i>- I'm at a payphone.
- Yeah, I *69'd you. I never pick up my phone.</i>

415
00:29:02,779 --> 00:29:04,873
<i>So what's up?</i>

416
00:29:05,549 --> 00:29:07,574
Well.

417
00:29:07,685 --> 00:29:09,744
You're not gonna believe this.

418
00:29:11,888 --> 00:29:14,119
You know, it could be worse.

419
00:29:14,191 --> 00:29:17,957
A woman could cut off your penis
while you sleep and toss it out of a car.

420
00:29:18,796 --> 00:29:22,095
There's always that. I don't know.

421
00:29:22,166 --> 00:29:25,294
When you buy furniture,
you tell yourself, that's it.

422
00:29:25,369 --> 00:29:27,463
That's the last sofa I'll need.

423
00:29:27,539 --> 00:29:30,337
Whatever happens,
that sofa problem is handled.

424
00:29:30,409 --> 00:29:33,866
I had it all.
I had a stereo that was very decent.

425
00:29:33,978 --> 00:29:37,506
A wardrobe that was getting very respectable.

426
00:29:37,582 --> 00:29:39,743
I was close to being complete.

427
00:29:39,818 --> 00:29:42,379
- Shit, man. Now it's all gone.
- All gone.

428
00:29:42,488 --> 00:29:45,217
All gone.

429
00:29:46,491 --> 00:29:48,516
Do you know what a duvet is?

430
00:29:48,593 --> 00:29:51,495
- A comforter.
- It's a blanket.

431
00:29:51,564 --> 00:29:55,556
Just a blanket. Why do guys
like you and I know what a duvet is?

432
00:29:55,634 --> 00:29:59,799
Is this essential to our survival
in the hunter-gatherer sense?

433
00:29:59,906 --> 00:30:01,533
No.

434
00:30:01,607 --> 00:30:03,598
What are we, then?

435
00:30:03,711 --> 00:30:06,304
I dunno. Consumers.

436
00:30:06,379 --> 00:30:08,438
Right. We're consumers.

437
00:30:08,548 --> 00:30:11,814
We are by-products of a lifestyle obsession.

438
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:15,820
Murder, crime, poverty.
These things don't concern me.

439
00:30:15,922 --> 00:30:19,359
What concerns me are celebrity magazines,

440
00:30:19,426 --> 00:30:21,519
television with 500 channels,

441
00:30:21,595 --> 00:30:24,257
some guy's name on my underwear. Rogaine.

442
00:30:24,365 --> 00:30:26,425
Viagra. Olestra.

443
00:30:26,534 --> 00:30:29,366
- Martha Stewart.
- Fuck Martha Stewart.

444
00:30:29,436 --> 00:30:32,928
She's polishing the brass on the Titanic.
It's all going down.

445
00:30:33,041 --> 00:30:36,772
So fuck off with your sofa units
and Strinne green stripe patterns.

446
00:30:36,845 --> 00:30:40,177
I say never be complete.

447
00:30:40,247 --> 00:30:42,273
I say stop being perfect.

448
00:30:42,384 --> 00:30:44,409
I say let's evolve.

449
00:30:44,486 --> 00:30:46,784
Let the chips fall where they may.

450
00:30:48,957 --> 00:30:51,050
But that's me, and I could be wrong.

451
00:30:51,159 --> 00:30:53,218
Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.

452
00:30:53,294 --> 00:30:55,786
It's just stuff. Not a tragedy...

453
00:30:55,865 --> 00:30:59,631
You did lose a lot of versatile solutions
for modern living.

454
00:30:59,701 --> 00:31:02,295
Fuck, you're right. I don't smoke.

455
00:31:05,674 --> 00:31:09,440
My insurance is probably gonna cover it, so...

456
00:31:11,881 --> 00:31:14,008
What?

457
00:31:14,116 --> 00:31:17,245
The things you own end up owning you.

458
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:22,648
Do what you like, man.

459
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:25,827
Oh, it's late.

460
00:31:25,896 --> 00:31:28,626
- Hey, thanks for the beer.
- Yeah, man.

461
00:31:28,698 --> 00:31:30,791
I should find a hotel.

462
00:31:31,535 --> 00:31:33,628
What?

463
00:31:33,703 --> 00:31:35,330
What?

464
00:31:35,439 --> 00:31:37,498
- A hotel?
- Yeah.

465
00:31:37,607 --> 00:31:40,668
- Just ask, man.
- What are you talking about?

466
00:31:40,745 --> 00:31:44,510
Oh, God. Three pitchers of beer
and you still can't ask.

467
00:31:45,515 --> 00:31:47,143
What?

468
00:31:47,251 --> 00:31:49,879
You called me
because you needed a place to stay.

469
00:31:49,954 --> 00:31:53,412
- Oh, hey. No, no, no.
- Yes, you did. So just ask.

470
00:31:53,491 --> 00:31:56,051
Cut the foreplay and just ask, man.

471
00:31:57,862 --> 00:32:00,126
Would... Would that be a problem?

472
00:32:00,231 --> 00:32:02,291
Is it a problem for you to ask?

473
00:32:03,302 --> 00:32:05,531
- Can I stay at your place?
- Yeah.

474
00:32:06,904 --> 00:32:08,964
Thanks.

475
00:32:13,145 --> 00:32:16,138
- I want you to do me a favor.
- Yeah, sure.

476
00:32:16,249 --> 00:32:18,648
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.

477
00:32:18,717 --> 00:32:20,685
What?

478
00:32:20,752 --> 00:32:24,587
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.

479
00:32:24,691 --> 00:32:27,591
<i>Let me tell you a little bit about Tyler Durden.</i>

480
00:32:27,793 --> 00:32:30,159
<i>Tyler was a night person.</i>

481
00:32:30,262 --> 00:32:32,493
While the rest of us slept, he worked.

482
00:32:32,565 --> 00:32:35,728
He had one part-time job as a projectionist.

483
00:32:35,802 --> 00:32:38,794
A movie doesn't come all on one big reel.
It comes on a few.

484
00:32:38,905 --> 00:32:42,602
Someone has to switch the projectors
at the exact moment

485
00:32:42,709 --> 00:32:45,941
that one reel ends and the next one begins.

486
00:32:46,013 --> 00:32:49,948
You can see little dots come into
the upper right corner of the screen.

487
00:32:50,016 --> 00:32:52,747
In the industry, we call them cigarette burns.

488
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,913
That's the cue for a changeover.

489
00:32:54,989 --> 00:32:59,756
He flips the projectors, movie keeps
going and the audience has no idea.

490
00:32:59,827 --> 00:33:02,091
Why would anyone want this shitjob?

491
00:33:02,196 --> 00:33:05,359
Because it affords him
interesting opportunities.

492
00:33:05,432 --> 00:33:08,960
Like splicing a frame of pornography
into family films.

493
00:33:09,037 --> 00:33:14,030
So when the snooty cat and the courageous
dog with the celebrity voices first meet,

494
00:33:14,175 --> 00:33:18,374
that's when you'll catch a flash
of Tyler's contribution to the film.

495
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:27,847
Nobody knows that they saw it but they did.

496
00:33:27,956 --> 00:33:30,517
Nice, big cock.

497
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:38,061
Even a hummingbird
couldn't catch Tyler at work.

498
00:33:43,406 --> 00:33:48,434
Tyler also works sometimes as a banquet
waiter at the luxurious Pressman hotel.

499
00:33:53,083 --> 00:33:57,143
<i>He was the guerrilla terrorist
of the food service industry.</i>

500
00:33:57,253 --> 00:33:59,552
Do not watch. I cannot go when you watch.

501
00:33:59,623 --> 00:34:04,026
Apart from seasoning the lobster bisque,
he farted on meringues,

502
00:34:04,094 --> 00:34:06,654
and as for the cream of mushroom soup...

503
00:34:06,763 --> 00:34:08,788
Go ahead, tell 'em.

504
00:34:08,865 --> 00:34:10,856
You get the idea.

505
00:34:11,068 --> 00:34:14,300
- You just want me to hit you?
- Come on. Do me this one favor.

506
00:34:14,405 --> 00:34:17,771
- Why?
- I don't know. Never been in a fight. You?

507
00:34:17,841 --> 00:34:21,835
- No. But that's a good thing.
- You can't know yourself if you haven't!

508
00:34:21,913 --> 00:34:24,279
I don't wanna die without any scars.

509
00:34:24,382 --> 00:34:28,648
- Come on. Hit me, before I lose my nerve.
- Oh, God. This is crazy.

510
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:31,018
So go crazy! Let it rip.

511
00:34:31,089 --> 00:34:33,785
- I don't know about this.
- I don't either.

512
00:34:33,858 --> 00:34:36,919
Who gives a shit? No-one's watching.
What do you care?

513
00:34:37,029 --> 00:34:39,496
This is crazy. You want me to hit you?!

514
00:34:39,597 --> 00:34:41,656
That's right.

515
00:34:41,733 --> 00:34:44,931
- Where? Like, in the face?
- Surprise me.

516
00:34:47,106 --> 00:34:49,199
This is so fucking stupid.

517
00:35:00,086 --> 00:35:02,280
Motherfucker!

518
00:35:02,354 --> 00:35:04,447
He hit me in the ear!

519
00:35:04,523 --> 00:35:07,721
- Well, Jesus, I'm sorry.
- Ow, Christ!

520
00:35:07,827 --> 00:35:09,886
- Why the ear, man?
- I fucked it up.

521
00:35:09,963 --> 00:35:11,692
No, that was perfect.

522
00:35:24,577 --> 00:35:26,704
No, it's all right.

523
00:35:27,548 --> 00:35:29,641
It really hurts.

524
00:35:30,084 --> 00:35:32,143
Right.

525
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,715
Hit me again.

526
00:35:34,789 --> 00:35:36,916
No, you hit me. Come on!

527
00:35:53,875 --> 00:35:56,366
We should do this again sometime.

528
00:36:09,157 --> 00:36:11,388
- Where's your car?
- What car?

529
00:36:21,904 --> 00:36:24,236
<i>I don't know how Tyler found that house</i>

530
00:36:24,374 --> 00:36:26,605
<i>but he said he'd been there for a year.</i>

531
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:29,576
<i>It looked like it was waiting to be torn down.</i>

532
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:32,045
<i>Most of the windows were boarded up.</i>

533
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:37,519
<i>There was no lock on the front door from
when the police, or whoever, kicked it in.</i>

534
00:36:37,588 --> 00:36:39,647
<i>The stairs were ready to collapse.</i>

535
00:36:39,757 --> 00:36:42,248
<i>I didn't know if he owned it or was squatting.</i>

536
00:36:42,393 --> 00:36:44,861
<i>Neither would have surprised me.</i>

537
00:36:45,763 --> 00:36:47,823
Yep. That's you.

538
00:36:47,932 --> 00:36:50,526
That's me. That's the toilet. Good?

539
00:36:50,602 --> 00:36:52,660
Yeah, thanks.

540
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:54,670
<i>What a shithole.</i>

541
00:36:54,772 --> 00:36:56,741
<i>Nothing worked.</i>

542
00:37:00,378 --> 00:37:04,280
<i>Turning on one light meant
another light in the house went out.</i>

543
00:37:04,416 --> 00:37:08,147
<i>There were no neighbors.
Just warehouses and a paper mill.</i>

544
00:37:08,219 --> 00:37:12,213
<i>That fart smell of steam.
The hamster-cage smell of wood chips.</i>

545
00:37:13,992 --> 00:37:16,392
What have we here?

546
00:37:31,177 --> 00:37:33,271
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

547
00:37:44,257 --> 00:37:47,317
<i>Every time it rained, we had to kill the power.</i>

548
00:37:48,228 --> 00:37:51,629
<i>By the end of the first month,
I didn't miss TV.</i>

549
00:37:52,666 --> 00:37:56,000
<i>I didn't even mind the warm, stale refrigerator.</i>

550
00:38:08,348 --> 00:38:10,476
Can I be next?

551
00:38:14,889 --> 00:38:16,949
All right, man.

552
00:38:17,059 --> 00:38:19,049
Lose the tie.

553
00:38:23,064 --> 00:38:27,468
<i>At night, Tyler and I were alone
for half a mile in every direction.</i>

554
00:38:32,908 --> 00:38:36,844
<i>Rain trickled down through
the plaster and the light fixtures.</i>

555
00:38:36,912 --> 00:38:39,746
<i>Everything wooden swelled and shrank.</i>

556
00:38:39,849 --> 00:38:43,045
<i>Everywhere were rusted nails
to snag your elbow on.</i>

557
00:38:43,118 --> 00:38:45,713
<i>The previous occupant had been a shut-in.</i>

558
00:38:45,788 --> 00:38:47,881
Hey, man. What are you reading?

559
00:38:47,957 --> 00:38:52,325
Listen to this. It's an article written
by an organ in the first person.

560
00:38:52,394 --> 00:38:55,159
"I am Jack's medulla oblongata.
Without me,

561
00:38:55,265 --> 00:38:58,723
Jack could not regulate
his heart rate or breathing."

562
00:38:58,801 --> 00:39:00,895
There's a whole series of these.

563
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:03,063
"I Am Jill's Nipples."

564
00:39:05,074 --> 00:39:09,068
- "I Am Jack's Colon."
- "I Get Cancer. I Kill Jack."

565
00:39:12,316 --> 00:39:16,116
<i>After fighting, everything else
in life got the volume turned down.</i>

566
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:19,817
What?

567
00:39:19,924 --> 00:39:23,486
<i>- You could deal with anything.
- Have you finished those reports?</i>

568
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:30,727
<i>If you could choose,
who would you fight?</i>

569
00:39:30,802 --> 00:39:32,895
I'd fight my boss, probably.

570
00:39:32,971 --> 00:39:35,098
Really?

571
00:39:35,173 --> 00:39:38,540
- Yeah, why? Who would you fight?
- I'd fight my dad.

572
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:40,703
I don't know my dad.

573
00:39:40,779 --> 00:39:42,713
I mean, I know him, but...

574
00:39:42,781 --> 00:39:45,148
He left when I was like, six years old.

575
00:39:45,217 --> 00:39:48,208
Married this other woman
and had some other kids.

576
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,379
He did this every six years.

577
00:39:50,522 --> 00:39:54,619
- He changes city and starts a new family.
- Fucker's setting up franchises!

578
00:39:55,428 --> 00:39:57,554
My dad never went to college.

579
00:39:57,629 --> 00:40:01,566
- So it was real important that I go.
- That sounds familiar.

580
00:40:01,634 --> 00:40:06,072
So I graduate. Call him up long-distance
and say, "Dad, now what?"

581
00:40:06,173 --> 00:40:08,164
- He says, "Get ajob."
- Same here.

582
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,936
Now I'm 25. Make my yearly call again.

583
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:13,001
"Dad, now what?"

584
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:15,207
He says, "I dunno. Get married."

585
00:40:15,282 --> 00:40:18,774
You can't get married.

586
00:40:19,552 --> 00:40:21,612
I'm a 30-year-old boy.

587
00:40:21,688 --> 00:40:24,179
We're a generation of men raised by women.

588
00:40:24,257 --> 00:40:28,558
I'm wondering if another woman
is really the answer we need.

589
00:40:34,568 --> 00:40:37,766
<i>Most of the week, we were Ozzie and Harriet.</i>

590
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:42,075
<i>But every Saturday night,
we were finding something out.</i>

591
00:40:43,277 --> 00:40:46,769
<i>We were finding out more and more
that we were not alone.</i>

592
00:40:50,686 --> 00:40:55,315
<i>It used to be that when I came home angry
or depressed, I'd just clean my condo.</i>

593
00:40:55,423 --> 00:40:57,483
<i>Polish my Scandinavian furniture.</i>

594
00:40:57,626 --> 00:41:02,654
<i>I should have been looking for a new condo
or haggling with my insurance company.</i>

595
00:41:02,731 --> 00:41:06,497
<i>I should have been upset
about my nice flaming little shit.</i>

596
00:41:06,635 --> 00:41:08,500
<i>But I wasn't.</i>

597
00:41:08,637 --> 00:41:12,267
The premise of cybernetting an office
is make things more efficient.

598
00:41:12,342 --> 00:41:15,208
<i>Monday mornings,
I just thought about next week.</i>

599
00:41:15,277 --> 00:41:18,303
Can I get the icon in cornflower blue?

600
00:41:18,414 --> 00:41:19,507
Absolutely.

601
00:41:19,649 --> 00:41:22,880
Efficiency is priority No.1, people.

602
00:41:23,019 --> 00:41:25,816
Because waste is a thief.

603
00:41:25,888 --> 00:41:29,017
I showed this to my man here.
You liked it, didn't you?

604
00:41:32,696 --> 00:41:36,632
<i>You can swallow a pint of blood
before you get sick.</i>

605
00:41:37,667 --> 00:41:39,897
<i>It was right in everyone's face.</i>

606
00:41:39,969 --> 00:41:42,131
<i>Tyler and I just made it visible.</i>

607
00:41:42,239 --> 00:41:44,673
<i>It was on the tip of everyone's tongue.</i>

608
00:41:44,742 --> 00:41:46,835
<i>Tyler and I just gave it a name.</i>

609
00:41:58,055 --> 00:42:00,114
Come on, you've gotta go home!

610
00:42:22,347 --> 00:42:24,679
Turn off the jukebox. Lock the back.

611
00:42:45,571 --> 00:42:49,303
<i>Every week,
Tyler gave the rules that he and I decided.</i>

612
00:42:49,376 --> 00:42:51,435
Gentlemen!

613
00:42:52,212 --> 00:42:54,304
Welcome to Fight Club.

614
00:42:56,416 --> 00:42:58,577
The first rule of Fight Club is

615
00:42:58,719 --> 00:43:01,051
you do not talk about Fight Club.

616
00:43:01,155 --> 00:43:03,750
The second rule of Fight Club is

617
00:43:04,158 --> 00:43:07,594
you do not talk about Fight Club!

618
00:43:07,728 --> 00:43:09,993
Third rule of Fight Club.

619
00:43:10,064 --> 00:43:12,862
Someone yells stop, goes limp, taps out,

620
00:43:12,967 --> 00:43:15,730
the fight is over. Fourth rule.

621
00:43:15,803 --> 00:43:18,136
Only two guys to a fight.

622
00:43:18,206 --> 00:43:20,071
Fifth rule.

623
00:43:20,175 --> 00:43:22,837
One fight at a time, fellas.

624
00:43:22,944 --> 00:43:25,413
Sixth rule. No shirts. No shoes.

625
00:43:25,481 --> 00:43:29,416
Seventh rule.
Fights will go on as long as they have to.

626
00:43:31,252 --> 00:43:33,847
And the eighth and final rule.

627
00:43:34,990 --> 00:43:38,186
If this is your first night at Fight Club

628
00:43:38,259 --> 00:43:40,353
you have to fight.

629
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,460
<i>This kid from work, Ricky,</i>

630
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:51,063
<i>couldn't remember whether
you ordered pens with blue ink or black.</i>

631
00:43:51,173 --> 00:43:53,573
<i>But Ricky was a god for ten minutes</i>

632
00:43:53,642 --> 00:43:57,010
<i>when he trounced
the maitre d' of a local food court.</i>

633
00:43:58,881 --> 00:44:04,218
<i>Sometimes, all you could hear were the flat,
hard, packing sounds over the yelling.</i>

634
00:44:07,991 --> 00:44:11,017
<i>Or the wet choke
when someone gasped and sprayed...</i>

635
00:44:11,094 --> 00:44:13,119
Stop!

636
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:16,098
<i>You weren't alive anywhere
like you were there.</i>

637
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:21,000
<i>But Fight Club only exists in the hours
between when Fight Club starts and ends.</i>

638
00:44:21,504 --> 00:44:24,531
<i>Even if I could tell someone
they had a good fight,</i>

639
00:44:24,642 --> 00:44:26,940
<i>I wouldn't be talking to the same man.</i>

640
00:44:27,044 --> 00:44:30,343
<i>Who you were in Fight Club
is not who you were outside of it.</i>

641
00:44:30,448 --> 00:44:35,476
<i>A guy came to Fight Club for the first time.
His ass was a wad of cookie dough.</i>

642
00:44:35,553 --> 00:44:38,421
<i>After a few weeks, he was carved out of wood.</i>

643
00:44:39,258 --> 00:44:42,455
If you could fight any celebrity,
who would you fight?

644
00:44:42,526 --> 00:44:45,655
- Alive or dead?
- Doesn't matter. Who'd be tough?

645
00:44:46,565 --> 00:44:49,693
Hemingway. You?

646
00:44:50,335 --> 00:44:53,498
Shatner. I'd fight William Shatner.

647
00:44:54,539 --> 00:44:57,770
<i>We all started seeing things differently.</i>

648
00:44:59,044 --> 00:45:02,378
<i>Everywhere we went,
we were sizing things up.</i>

649
00:45:05,717 --> 00:45:08,881
<i>I felt sorry for guys packed into gyms,</i>

650
00:45:08,955 --> 00:45:13,051
<i>trying to look like how Calvin Klein
or Tommy Hilfiger said they should.</i>

651
00:45:13,126 --> 00:45:15,254
Is that what a man looks like?

652
00:45:16,162 --> 00:45:18,995
Oh, self-improvement is masturbation.

653
00:45:19,098 --> 00:45:21,157
Now, self-destruction...

654
00:45:21,267 --> 00:45:23,259
Excuse me.

655
00:45:57,906 --> 00:46:01,103
<i>Fight Club wasn't about winning or losing.</i>

656
00:46:01,176 --> 00:46:03,235
<i>It wasn't about words.</i>

657
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:08,639
<i>The hysterical shouting was in tongues</i>

658
00:46:08,751 --> 00:46:10,718
<i>like at a Pentecostal Church.</i>

659
00:46:15,257 --> 00:46:17,350
- Is that it?
- Stop!

660
00:46:17,426 --> 00:46:20,327
<i>When the fight was over, nothing was solved.</i>

661
00:46:20,396 --> 00:46:22,330
<i>But nothing mattered.</i>

662
00:46:22,398 --> 00:46:25,196
Cool.

663
00:46:25,267 --> 00:46:28,066
<i>Afterwards, we all felt saved.</i>

664
00:46:29,006 --> 00:46:31,270
Hey, man. How about next week?

665
00:46:31,375 --> 00:46:33,433
How about next month?!

666
00:46:33,542 --> 00:46:35,602
Irvine, you're in the middle.

667
00:46:35,679 --> 00:46:37,738
New guy, you too.

668
00:46:39,483 --> 00:46:41,644
<i>Sometimes, Tyler spoke for me.</i>

669
00:46:41,752 --> 00:46:43,845
He fell down some stairs.

670
00:46:44,488 --> 00:46:46,581
I fell down some stairs.

671
00:46:48,425 --> 00:46:53,090
<i>Fight Club became the reason to cut
your hair short or trim your fingernails.</i>

672
00:46:53,197 --> 00:46:55,664
OK. Any historical figure.

673
00:46:55,766 --> 00:46:57,632
I'd fight Gandhi.

674
00:46:58,269 --> 00:47:00,100
Good answer.

675
00:47:00,204 --> 00:47:02,434
- How about you?
- Lincoln.

676
00:47:02,507 --> 00:47:05,102
Lincoln?

677
00:47:05,209 --> 00:47:08,804
Big guy, big reach.
Skinny guys fight till they're burger.

678
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:11,773
Fuck!

679
00:47:12,985 --> 00:47:15,647
Hey, even the Mona Lisa's falling apart.

680
00:47:24,730 --> 00:47:26,129
Hello?

681
00:47:26,231 --> 00:47:28,631
<i>Where have you been the last eight weeks?</i>

682
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:30,031
<i>Marla?</i>

683
00:47:33,005 --> 00:47:36,134
<i>- How did you find me?
- You left a forwarding number.</i>

684
00:47:36,242 --> 00:47:39,233
I haven't seen you at any support groups.

685
00:47:39,311 --> 00:47:42,509
<i>We split 'em up.
That was the idea. Remember?</i>

686
00:47:42,615 --> 00:47:45,448
Yeah, but you haven't been going to yours.

687
00:47:45,518 --> 00:47:49,045
- How do you know?
- I cheated.

688
00:47:49,122 --> 00:47:50,953
I found a new one.

689
00:47:51,491 --> 00:47:53,755
- Really?
- It's for men only.

690
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:55,452
Like the testicle thing?

691
00:47:59,233 --> 00:48:01,257
Look, this is a bad time.

692
00:48:01,334 --> 00:48:03,769
I've been going to Debtors Anonymous.

693
00:48:03,871 --> 00:48:07,432
<i>- They're really fucked-up people...
- I'm on my way out.</i>

694
00:48:07,508 --> 00:48:09,874
Me too. I've got a stomach full of Xanax.

695
00:48:09,977 --> 00:48:12,275
I took what was left of a bottle.

696
00:48:12,346 --> 00:48:14,439
It might have been too much.

697
00:48:14,515 --> 00:48:18,144
<i>Picture Marla Singer throw herself
around her crummy apartment.</i>

698
00:48:18,286 --> 00:48:22,745
This isn't a for-real suicide thing.
This is probably a cry-for-help thing.

699
00:48:22,857 --> 00:48:25,759
So you're staying in tonight, then?

700
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:28,694
Do you wanna wait
and hear me describe death?

701
00:48:28,763 --> 00:48:33,291
<i>Do you wanna listen
and see if my spirit can use a phone?</i>

702
00:48:35,537 --> 00:48:38,199
<i>Have you ever heard a death rattle before?</i>

703
00:49:04,501 --> 00:49:09,335
<i>Tyler's door was closed. I'd been here for
two months and his door was never closed.</i>

704
00:49:14,344 --> 00:49:17,404
You won't believe this dream
I had last night.

705
00:49:17,514 --> 00:49:20,779
I can hardly believe anything about last night.

706
00:49:30,594 --> 00:49:32,563
What are you doing here?

707
00:49:35,266 --> 00:49:37,359
What?

708
00:49:37,435 --> 00:49:39,869
This is my house.
What are you doing here?

709
00:49:42,273 --> 00:49:44,264
Fuck you!

710
00:49:58,891 --> 00:50:02,258
Oh, you've got some fucked-up friends!

711
00:50:02,361 --> 00:50:04,352
Limber, though.

712
00:50:04,430 --> 00:50:06,421
Silly cooze.

713
00:50:07,499 --> 00:50:10,230
I come in last night. Phone's off the hook.

714
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:12,395
Guess who's on the other end?

715
00:50:12,471 --> 00:50:14,666
<i>I knew the story before he told me.</i>

716
00:50:16,977 --> 00:50:20,572
<i>Have you ever heard a death rattle before?</i>

717
00:50:20,647 --> 00:50:23,480
Do you think it'll live up to its name?

718
00:50:23,583 --> 00:50:27,178
<i>Or will it just be a death hairball?</i>

719
00:50:30,591 --> 00:50:34,583
<i>Prepare to evacuate soul.</i>

720
00:50:34,661 --> 00:50:36,288
<i>Ten,</i>

721
00:50:36,396 --> 00:50:39,195
<i>nine,... eight...</i>

722
00:50:39,267 --> 00:50:41,497
<i>How could Tyler, of all people,</i>

723
00:50:41,602 --> 00:50:45,470
<i>think it was a bad thing
that Marla Singer was about to die?</i>

724
00:50:45,539 --> 00:50:47,200
<i>Five,</i>

725
00:50:47,275 --> 00:50:48,867
<i>four...</i>

726
00:50:49,644 --> 00:50:51,703
Hang on.

727
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:59,483
You got here fast.

728
00:51:01,023 --> 00:51:03,116
Did I call you?

729
00:51:13,835 --> 00:51:16,930
The mattress is all sealed in slippery plastic.

730
00:51:20,175 --> 00:51:22,576
Oh, don't worry. It's not a threat to you.

731
00:51:25,381 --> 00:51:27,281
Oh, fuck!

732
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:29,443
Somebody called the cops.

733
00:51:41,364 --> 00:51:44,857
- Hey, where's 513?
- End of the hall.

734
00:51:45,669 --> 00:51:49,537
The girl who lives there
used to be a charming, lovely girl.

735
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:51,767
She has lost faith in herself.

736
00:51:51,875 --> 00:51:54,708
- Miss Singer, let us help you!
- She's a monster!

737
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:58,909
- You have every reason to live.
- She's infectious human waste!

738
00:51:58,983 --> 00:52:02,782
- Miss Singer!
- Good luck trying to save her!

739
00:52:07,592 --> 00:52:09,787
If I fall asleep,

740
00:52:09,894 --> 00:52:12,158
I'm done for.

741
00:52:14,132 --> 00:52:16,327
You're gonna have to keep me up

742
00:52:16,401 --> 00:52:18,494
all night.

743
00:52:18,570 --> 00:52:20,903
Un-fucking-believable.

744
00:52:20,973 --> 00:52:23,168
<i>He was obviously able to handle it.</i>

745
00:52:23,242 --> 00:52:26,938
- You know what I mean, you fucked her.
- No, I didn't.

746
00:52:27,011 --> 00:52:29,139
- Never?
- No.

747
00:52:30,049 --> 00:52:32,176
You're not into her, are you?

748
00:52:32,251 --> 00:52:34,343
No! God, not at all.

749
00:52:34,419 --> 00:52:37,014
<i>I am Jack's raging bile duct.</i>

750
00:52:37,156 --> 00:52:39,056
Are you sure? You can tell me.

751
00:52:39,191 --> 00:52:41,022
Believe me, I'm sure.

752
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:44,426
<i>- Put a gun to my head and spray my brains.
- That's good.</i>

753
00:52:44,531 --> 00:52:47,260
She's a predator posing as a house pet.
Stay away.

754
00:52:49,235 --> 00:52:52,865
The shit that came out of
this woman's mouth, I had never heard!

755
00:52:52,973 --> 00:52:54,634
My God.

756
00:52:54,741 --> 00:52:58,074
I haven't been fucked like that
since grade school.

757
00:52:58,211 --> 00:53:00,645
<i>How could Tyler not go for that?</i>

758
00:53:00,747 --> 00:53:04,274
<i>The other night,
he was splicing sex organs into Cinderella.</i>

759
00:53:04,384 --> 00:53:07,183
Marla doesn't need a lover,
just a caseworker.

760
00:53:07,254 --> 00:53:09,848
Or a wash.
This isn't love, it's sport fucking.

761
00:53:09,956 --> 00:53:12,824
<i>She invaded my support groups
and now my home.</i>

762
00:53:12,894 --> 00:53:14,987
Hey, hey. Sit down.

763
00:53:19,065 --> 00:53:22,502
Now, listen.
I can't have you talking to her about me.

764
00:53:22,603 --> 00:53:24,434
Why would I...

765
00:53:24,505 --> 00:53:29,875
Say anything about me or what goes on
in this house to her or anybody,... we're done.

766
00:53:29,977 --> 00:53:32,639
- Now promise me. You promise?
- OK.

767
00:53:32,713 --> 00:53:34,841
- Yeah, I promise.
- Promise?

768
00:53:34,917 --> 00:53:38,318
- I just said, I promise! What...
- That's three times you promised.

769
00:53:39,822 --> 00:53:43,815
<i>If only I had wasted a few minutes
and gone to watch Marla Singer die,</i>

770
00:53:43,892 --> 00:53:45,985
<i>none of this would have happened.</i>

771
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:53,834
Harder, yes! Oh, harder, harder!

772
00:54:00,443 --> 00:54:02,910
<i>I could have moved to another room.</i>

773
00:54:04,047 --> 00:54:07,881
<i>On the third floor
where I might not have heard them.</i>

774
00:54:07,951 --> 00:54:10,044
<i>But I didn't.</i>

775
00:54:34,279 --> 00:54:38,374
- What are you doing?
- Just going to bed.

776
00:54:38,482 --> 00:54:40,542
Wanna finish her off?

777
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:46,981
- No. No, thank you.
- I've found a cigarette.

778
00:54:47,091 --> 00:54:50,459
- Who were you talking to?
- Shut up.

779
00:54:50,529 --> 00:54:53,794
<i>I became the calm little center of the world.</i>

780
00:54:54,466 --> 00:54:56,526
<i>I was the Zen master.</i>

781
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:03,665
<i>I wrote little haiku poems.</i>

782
00:55:04,310 --> 00:55:06,608
<i>I e-mailed them to everyone.</i>

783
00:55:06,712 --> 00:55:08,804
Is that your blood?

784
00:55:10,516 --> 00:55:12,575
Some of it, yeah.

785
00:55:12,685 --> 00:55:15,347
You can't smoke in here.

786
00:55:15,421 --> 00:55:17,515
Take the rest of the day off.

787
00:55:17,591 --> 00:55:20,115
Come back Monday with some clean clothes.

788
00:55:20,192 --> 00:55:22,319
Get yourself together.

789
00:55:22,695 --> 00:55:25,028
<i>I got right in everyone's hostile face.</i>

790
00:55:25,132 --> 00:55:27,623
<i>"Yes, these are bruises from fighting."</i>

791
00:55:27,734 --> 00:55:29,793
<i>"Yes, I'm comfortable with that."</i>

792
00:55:29,902 --> 00:55:31,768
<i>"I am enlightened."</i>

793
00:55:33,707 --> 00:55:38,838
<i>You give up the condo life, give up
all your flaming worldly possessions,</i>

794
00:55:38,946 --> 00:55:42,006
<i>move to a dilapidated house
in a toxic waste area,</i>

795
00:55:42,115 --> 00:55:45,983
<i>and you have to come home to this.</i>

796
00:55:56,631 --> 00:56:00,032
<i>- Hello.
- This is Detective Stern with the Arson Unit.</i>

797
00:56:00,134 --> 00:56:04,366
<i>We have some new information about
the incident at your former condo.</i>

798
00:56:04,439 --> 00:56:05,736
Yes.

799
00:56:05,807 --> 00:56:10,745
I don't know if you're aware, but someone
sprayed Freon into your front-door lock.

800
00:56:10,813 --> 00:56:13,475
<i>They used a chisel to shatter the cylinder.</i>

801
00:56:13,582 --> 00:56:15,572
No, I wasn't aware of that.

802
00:56:15,650 --> 00:56:17,642
<i>I am Jack's cold sweat.</i>

803
00:56:17,753 --> 00:56:20,017
Does this sound strange to you?

804
00:56:20,089 --> 00:56:22,956
<i>Yes, sir, strange. Very strange.</i>

805
00:56:23,025 --> 00:56:25,050
<i>- The dynamite
- Dynamite?</i>

806
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:28,254
left a residue
of ammonium oxalate potassium perchloride.

807
00:56:28,397 --> 00:56:31,834
<i>- Do you know what this means?
- No, what does it mean?</i>

808
00:56:31,901 --> 00:56:33,835
It means it was home-made.

809
00:56:33,903 --> 00:56:38,169
I'm sorry. This is just coming
as quite a shock to me, sir.

810
00:56:38,241 --> 00:56:43,804
Whoever set this dynamite could have blown
out your pilot light days before the explosion.

811
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:46,974
<i>- The gas was just a detonator.
- Who would go and do that?</i>

812
00:56:47,050 --> 00:56:49,109
<i>- I'll ask the questions.
- Tell him.</i>

813
00:56:49,252 --> 00:56:53,656
Tell him the liberator who destroyed
my property realigned my perceptions.

814
00:56:53,724 --> 00:56:55,817
<i>Excuse me. Are you there?</i>

815
00:56:55,893 --> 00:56:58,827
I am listening.
It's hard to know what to make of this.

816
00:56:58,895 --> 00:57:03,390
Have you recently made enemies who might
have access to home-made dynamite?

817
00:57:03,467 --> 00:57:05,731
- Enemies?
- Reject civilization,

818
00:57:05,836 --> 00:57:07,896
especially material possessions.

819
00:57:08,006 --> 00:57:10,872
<i>- Son, this is serious.
- Yes, I know it's serious.</i>

820
00:57:10,941 --> 00:57:13,535
<i>- I mean that.
- Yes, it's very serious.</i>

821
00:57:13,644 --> 00:57:16,478
Look, nobody takes this
more seriously than me.

822
00:57:16,548 --> 00:57:19,278
That condo was my life. OK?

823
00:57:19,418 --> 00:57:22,910
I loved every stick of furniture in that place.

824
00:57:23,021 --> 00:57:26,047
<i>That was not just a bunch of stuff
that got destroyed.</i>

825
00:57:26,124 --> 00:57:29,025
<i>- It was me!
- I'd like to thank the Academy.</i>

826
00:57:29,094 --> 00:57:33,121
<i>- Is this not a good time for you?
- Just tell him you fucking did it!</i>

827
00:57:33,231 --> 00:57:37,100
Tell him you blew it all up!
That's what he wants to hear.

828
00:57:37,170 --> 00:57:42,072
<i>- Are you still there?
- Wait. Are you saying that I'm a suspect?</i>

829
00:57:42,140 --> 00:57:46,134
No. I may need to talk to you, so you
let me know if you're gonna leave town.

830
00:57:46,245 --> 00:57:48,645
<i>- OK?
- OK.</i>

831
00:57:51,318 --> 00:57:55,947
<i>Except for their humping,
Tyler and Marla were never in the same room.</i>

832
00:57:56,055 --> 00:57:59,116
<i>My parents pulled this exact same act
for years.</i>

833
00:57:59,193 --> 00:58:02,959
The condom is the glass slipper
of our generation.

834
00:58:03,063 --> 00:58:05,964
You slip one on when you meet a stranger.

835
00:58:06,066 --> 00:58:08,125
You... dance all night.

836
00:58:08,202 --> 00:58:10,295
Then you throw it away.

837
00:58:10,537 --> 00:58:13,165
The condom, I mean. Not the stranger.

838
00:58:14,708 --> 00:58:16,175
What?

839
00:58:21,015 --> 00:58:23,813
I got this dress at a thrift store for $1.

840
00:58:23,918 --> 00:58:25,782
It was worth every penny.

841
00:58:25,886 --> 00:58:27,946
It's a bridesmaid's dress.

842
00:58:28,923 --> 00:58:32,120
Someone loved it intensely

843
00:58:32,193 --> 00:58:34,218
for one day.

844
00:58:34,329 --> 00:58:36,422
Then tossed it.

845
00:58:38,299 --> 00:58:40,358
Like a Christmas tree.

846
00:58:40,502 --> 00:58:42,595
So special.

847
00:58:42,705 --> 00:58:44,138
Then

848
00:58:44,206 --> 00:58:46,003
bam!

849
00:58:46,108 --> 00:58:48,166
It's on the side of the road.

850
00:58:48,743 --> 00:58:50,837
Tinsel still clinging to it.

851
00:58:52,915 --> 00:58:54,974
Like a sex crime victim.

852
00:58:55,050 --> 00:58:57,143
Underwear inside out.

853
00:58:57,821 --> 00:59:01,654
- Bound with electrical tape.
- Well then, it suits you.

854
00:59:01,757 --> 00:59:04,453
You can borrow it sometime.

855
00:59:11,467 --> 00:59:13,561
Get rid of her.

856
00:59:14,337 --> 00:59:17,238
<i>- What? You get rid of her!
- Don't mention me.</i>

857
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:21,538
<i>I am six years old again,
passing messages between parents.</i>

858
00:59:23,547 --> 00:59:27,143
- I really think it's time you left.
- Don't worry, I'm leaving.

859
00:59:27,218 --> 00:59:31,847
- Not that we don't love your visits.
- You are such a nutcase. I can't keep up.

860
00:59:34,024 --> 00:59:36,892
Gotta get off

861
00:59:36,994 --> 00:59:38,256
Thanks. Bye.

862
00:59:38,362 --> 00:59:44,301
Gotta get off of this merry-go-round

863
00:59:45,069 --> 00:59:48,904
Gonna get, need to get...

864
00:59:49,007 --> 00:59:51,032
Gotta get...

865
00:59:53,244 --> 00:59:54,677
You kids!

866
00:59:56,682 --> 00:59:59,173
Why do you still waste time with her?

867
00:59:59,251 --> 01:00:01,583
I'll say this about Marla.

868
01:00:01,653 --> 01:00:03,918
<i>At least she's trying to hit bottom.</i>

869
01:00:04,023 --> 01:00:05,319
And I'm not?

870
01:00:05,424 --> 01:00:08,257
Feathers up your butt
do not make you a chicken.

871
01:00:08,327 --> 01:00:10,420
What are we doing tonight?

872
01:00:11,097 --> 01:00:13,327
Tonight... we make soap.

873
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:15,425
Really?

874
01:00:15,534 --> 01:00:18,368
To make soap, first we render fat.

875
01:00:37,257 --> 01:00:39,487
The salt balance has to be just right

876
01:00:39,626 --> 01:00:42,118
so the best fat for soap comes from humans.

877
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:46,024
- Wait, what is this place?
- A liposuction clinic.

878
01:00:54,108 --> 01:00:56,134
Pay dirt!

879
01:00:56,244 --> 01:01:00,077
Richest, creamiest fat in the world.
Fat of the land!

880
01:01:05,687 --> 01:01:09,248
No! Don't pull it, don't pull it!

881
01:01:13,862 --> 01:01:16,126
- Oh, God!
- Give me another one.

882
01:01:22,270 --> 01:01:25,729
As the fat renders,
the tallows float to the surface.

883
01:01:25,808 --> 01:01:27,901
Like in Boy Scouts.

884
01:01:27,977 --> 01:01:31,778
- It's hard to imagine you as a Boy Scout.
- Keep stirring.

885
01:01:34,116 --> 01:01:37,677
Once the tallow hardens,
you skim off a layer of glycerin.

886
01:01:37,753 --> 01:01:40,154
Add nitric acid, you've got nitroglycerin.

887
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:44,090
Then add sodium nitrate and sawdust,
you've got dynamite.

888
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:47,995
Yeah, with enough soap,
one could blow up just about anything.

889
01:01:48,098 --> 01:01:50,157
<i>Tyler was full of useful information.</i>

890
01:01:50,233 --> 01:01:54,192
People found clothes got cleaner
when washed at a certain point in the river.

891
01:01:54,304 --> 01:01:56,329
- You know why?
- No.

892
01:01:59,176 --> 01:02:02,977
Human sacrifices were once made
on the hills above this river.

893
01:02:03,047 --> 01:02:06,243
Bodies burnt.
Water permeated the ashes to create lye.

894
01:02:06,350 --> 01:02:08,785
This is lye. The crucial ingredient.

895
01:02:08,853 --> 01:02:13,654
Once it mixed with the melted body fat,
a white soapy discharge crept into the river.

896
01:02:13,758 --> 01:02:15,817
May I see your hand, please?

897
01:02:21,199 --> 01:02:24,431
What is this?

898
01:02:24,536 --> 01:02:27,129
This is a chemical burn.

899
01:02:27,205 --> 01:02:30,733
It will hurt more than any burn
and it will leave a scar.

900
01:02:30,809 --> 01:02:33,437
<i>Meditation worked for cancer,
it could work now.</i>

901
01:02:34,246 --> 01:02:37,010
- Don't shut the pain out.
- Oh, God!

902
01:02:37,816 --> 01:02:42,253
The first soap was made from heroes' ashes,
like the first monkey shot into space.

903
01:02:42,354 --> 01:02:45,347
Without pain or sacrifice,
we would have nothing.

904
01:02:45,425 --> 01:02:48,360
<i>I tried not to think
of the word searing of flesh.</i>

905
01:02:48,428 --> 01:02:51,590
Stop it!
This is your pain, this is your burning hand.

906
01:02:51,697 --> 01:02:54,360
I'm going to my cave
to find my power animal.

907
01:02:54,434 --> 01:02:58,461
No! Don't deal with this
the way those dead people do! Come on!

908
01:02:58,571 --> 01:03:02,564
- I get the point!
- No! You're feeling premature enlightenment.

909
01:03:05,378 --> 01:03:09,440
It's the greatest moment of your life,
and you're off somewhere else!

910
01:03:09,517 --> 01:03:11,040
I am not!

911
01:03:11,117 --> 01:03:14,109
Shut up!
Our fathers were our models for God.

912
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:17,384
If our fathers bailed,
what does that tell you about God?

913
01:03:18,392 --> 01:03:23,625
Listen to me. You have to consider
the possibility that God does not like you.

914
01:03:23,731 --> 01:03:27,827
He never wanted you.
In all probability, He hates you.

915
01:03:27,902 --> 01:03:31,464
This is not the worst thing that can happen.
We don't need Him!

916
01:03:31,540 --> 01:03:34,508
- I agree!
- Fuck damnation, fuck redemption.

917
01:03:34,608 --> 01:03:37,100
We are God's unwanted children? So be it!

918
01:03:37,212 --> 01:03:41,706
- I'm getting water!
- You can use water and make it worse or...

919
01:03:42,851 --> 01:03:46,343
- Or use vinegar to neutralize the burn.
- Please let me up!

920
01:03:46,455 --> 01:03:48,514
First, you have to give up.

921
01:03:48,623 --> 01:03:51,320
First, you have to know, not fear,

922
01:03:51,427 --> 01:03:54,419
know that some day, you're gonna die.

923
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:56,726
You don't know how this feels!

924
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:04,970
It's only after we've lost everything
that we're free to do anything.

925
01:04:06,976 --> 01:04:09,069
OK.

926
01:04:22,326 --> 01:04:24,351
Congratulations.

927
01:04:24,461 --> 01:04:27,362
You're one step closer to hitting the bottom.

928
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:33,460
<i>Tyler sold his soap
to department stores at $20 a bar.</i>

929
01:04:33,537 --> 01:04:35,529
<i>God knows what they charged.</i>

930
01:04:35,607 --> 01:04:38,871
- This is the best soap.
- Why, thank you, Susan.

931
01:04:38,942 --> 01:04:41,001
<i>It was beautiful.</i>

932
01:04:41,111 --> 01:04:44,980
<i>We were selling rich women
their own fat asses back to them.</i>

933
01:04:45,984 --> 01:04:48,077
<i>He was wearing his yellow tie.</i>

934
01:04:48,153 --> 01:04:50,417
<i>I didn't wear a tie to work any more.</i>

935
01:04:50,522 --> 01:04:54,151
"The first rule of Fight Club
is don't talk about Fight Club."

936
01:04:54,225 --> 01:04:57,787
<i>I'm half-asleep again.
I must have left it in the copy machine.</i>

937
01:04:57,897 --> 01:05:00,364
"The second rule..." Is this yours?

938
01:05:02,233 --> 01:05:05,795
Pretend you're me.
Make a managerial decision.

939
01:05:05,905 --> 01:05:08,339
You find this. What would you do?

940
01:05:12,978 --> 01:05:14,969
Well, I gotta tell you,

941
01:05:15,047 --> 01:05:18,710
I'd be very, very careful
who you talk to about that.

942
01:05:18,817 --> 01:05:22,117
Because the person who wrote that
is dangerous.

943
01:05:22,189 --> 01:05:26,649
And this button-down, Oxford-cloth psycho
might just snap

944
01:05:26,793 --> 01:05:29,626
and then stalk from office to office

945
01:05:29,729 --> 01:05:34,792
with an Armalite AR10 carbine gas-powered
semiautomatic weapon,

946
01:05:34,868 --> 01:05:39,328
pumping round after round
into colleagues and co-workers.

947
01:05:40,006 --> 01:05:43,374
This might be someone
you've known for years.

948
01:05:43,444 --> 01:05:46,571
Someone very, very close to you.

949
01:05:46,646 --> 01:05:50,048
<i>Tyler's words coming out of my mouth.</i>

950
01:05:51,052 --> 01:05:53,145
<i>And I used to be such a nice guy.</i>

951
01:05:53,221 --> 01:05:56,554
Or maybe you shouldn't bring me
every piece of trash you pick up.

952
01:06:00,394 --> 01:06:04,058
- Compliance and Liability.
- My tit's gonna rot off.

953
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,559
Will you excuse me? I need to take this.

954
01:06:13,842 --> 01:06:17,470
- What do you mean?
- I need you to check for a lump in my breast.

955
01:06:17,578 --> 01:06:21,515
- Go to a hospital.
- I can't afford to waste money on a doctor.

956
01:06:22,484 --> 01:06:24,679
I don't know about this, Marla.

957
01:06:24,786 --> 01:06:26,482
Please.

958
01:06:26,589 --> 01:06:30,581
<i>She didn't call Tyler. I'm neutral in her book.</i>

959
01:06:32,628 --> 01:06:36,656
That's nice.
Taking food to Mrs Haniver and Mrs Raines.

960
01:06:36,733 --> 01:06:38,860
Where are they, exactly?

961
01:06:38,935 --> 01:06:43,065
Tragically, they're dead.
I'm alive and I'm in poverty. Want any?

962
01:06:43,139 --> 01:06:45,232
- No, no.
- I got one for you.

963
01:06:45,308 --> 01:06:47,401
Thanks for the thought.

964
01:06:48,746 --> 01:06:51,077
What happened to your hand?

965
01:06:51,147 --> 01:06:53,308
Oh, nothing.

966
01:06:53,416 --> 01:06:55,476
Right there?

967
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:59,216
- Feel anything?
- No.

968
01:06:59,323 --> 01:07:01,313
Well, make sure.

969
01:07:01,424 --> 01:07:03,450
OK, I'm pretty sure.

970
01:07:03,527 --> 01:07:05,518
You feel nothing?

971
01:07:05,629 --> 01:07:07,927
No, nothing.

972
01:07:09,466 --> 01:07:12,299
Well, that's a relief. Thank you.

973
01:07:13,904 --> 01:07:17,102
- No problem.
- I wish I could return the favor.

974
01:07:17,175 --> 01:07:19,268
Breast cancer doesn't run in my family.

975
01:07:19,344 --> 01:07:22,836
- I could check your prostate.
- I think I'm OK.

976
01:07:22,947 --> 01:07:25,040
Well, thanks, anyway.

977
01:07:30,055 --> 01:07:32,354
- Are we done?
- Yeah, we're done.

978
01:07:32,458 --> 01:07:34,652
See you... around.

979
01:07:51,869 --> 01:07:53,997
Cornelius?

980
01:07:54,072 --> 01:07:56,437
Cornelius!

981
01:07:56,540 --> 01:07:59,236
It's me! Bob!

982
01:07:59,343 --> 01:08:00,776
Hey, Bob.

983
01:08:04,349 --> 01:08:07,340
- We all thought you were dead.
- No, no. Still here.

984
01:08:07,418 --> 01:08:11,446
- How are you, Bob?
- Better than I've ever been in my whole life.

985
01:08:11,556 --> 01:08:15,048
- Really? Still remaining men together?
- No, no.

986
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:18,891
- I got something so much better now.
- Really, what is it?

987
01:08:19,564 --> 01:08:21,429
Well...

988
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:25,767
The first rule is,
I'm not supposed to talk about it.

989
01:08:25,872 --> 01:08:27,999
And the second rule is

990
01:08:28,074 --> 01:08:30,372
I'm not supposed to talk about it.

991
01:08:30,443 --> 01:08:33,879
- And the third rule is...
- Bob, Bob. I'm a member.

992
01:08:34,013 --> 01:08:36,072
Look at my face, Bob.

993
01:08:38,485 --> 01:08:40,816
That's fucking... fucking great.

994
01:08:40,887 --> 01:08:44,618
- I've never seen you there.
- I go Tuesdays and Thursdays.

995
01:08:44,691 --> 01:08:48,423
- I go Saturday.
- Congratulations.

996
01:08:48,829 --> 01:08:51,194
Yeah, hey, to both of us, right?

997
01:08:51,264 --> 01:08:53,893
Have you heard about the guy
that invented it?

998
01:08:54,034 --> 01:08:56,901
- Yeah, actually...
- I hear all kinds of things.

999
01:08:57,037 --> 01:09:00,633
Supposedly,
he was born in a mental institution

1000
01:09:00,709 --> 01:09:04,109
and he sleeps only one hour a night.

1001
01:09:04,211 --> 01:09:06,406
He's a great man.

1002
01:09:07,882 --> 01:09:10,214
Do you know about Tyler Durden?

1003
01:09:35,176 --> 01:09:37,270
I didn't hurt you, did I?

1004
01:09:37,346 --> 01:09:39,439
Actually, you did.

1005
01:09:39,515 --> 01:09:41,574
Thank you for this.

1006
01:09:41,851 --> 01:09:44,252
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1007
01:09:44,321 --> 01:09:46,379
<i>Fight Club.</i>

1008
01:09:46,489 --> 01:09:48,582
<i>This was mine and Tyler's gift.</i>

1009
01:09:48,791 --> 01:09:50,759
<i>Our gift to the world.</i>

1010
01:09:50,860 --> 01:09:54,194
I look around, I look around,
I see a lot of new faces.

1011
01:09:55,799 --> 01:09:57,993
Shut up!

1012
01:09:58,134 --> 01:10:02,970
Which means a lot of people have been
breaking the first two rules of Fight Club.

1013
01:10:11,314 --> 01:10:15,376
I see in Fight Club the strongest
and smartest men who've ever lived.

1014
01:10:15,486 --> 01:10:17,545
I see all this potential.

1015
01:10:17,622 --> 01:10:19,714
And I see it squandered.

1016
01:10:20,725 --> 01:10:23,819
Goddamn it,
an entire generation pumping gas.

1017
01:10:24,395 --> 01:10:26,488
Waiting tables.

1018
01:10:26,564 --> 01:10:28,624
Slaves with white collars.

1019
01:10:31,135 --> 01:10:34,195
Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes.

1020
01:10:34,305 --> 01:10:37,571
Working jobs we hate
so we can buy shit we don't need.

1021
01:10:41,445 --> 01:10:43,914
We're the middle children of history.

1022
01:10:43,982 --> 01:10:46,041
No purpose or place.

1023
01:10:46,251 --> 01:10:48,344
We have no Great War.

1024
01:10:48,654 --> 01:10:50,748
No Great Depression.

1025
01:10:52,524 --> 01:10:54,856
Our great war is a spiritual war.

1026
01:10:55,327 --> 01:10:58,661
Our great depression is our lives.

1027
01:11:01,534 --> 01:11:04,594
We've all been raised
on television to believe

1028
01:11:04,671 --> 01:11:08,368
that one day we'd be millionaires
and movie gods and rock stars.

1029
01:11:08,441 --> 01:11:10,534
But we won't.

1030
01:11:10,610 --> 01:11:13,045
We're slowly learning that fact.

1031
01:11:13,180 --> 01:11:15,613
And we're very, very pissed off.

1032
01:11:15,682 --> 01:11:17,343
Yeah!

1033
01:11:20,254 --> 01:11:24,690
- First rule of Fight Club is, do not talk...

1034
01:11:30,197 --> 01:11:31,459
Who are you?

1035
01:11:32,299 --> 01:11:34,894
- Who am I?
- Yeah.

1036
01:11:35,803 --> 01:11:38,636
There's a sign on the front
that says Lou's Tavern.

1037
01:11:39,707 --> 01:11:43,610
I'm fucking Lou. Who the fuck are you?

1038
01:11:43,678 --> 01:11:45,771
Tyler Durden.

1039
01:11:48,884 --> 01:11:52,376
Who told you motherfuckers
that you could use my place?

1040
01:11:52,454 --> 01:11:54,820
We have a deal worked out with Irvine.

1041
01:11:54,890 --> 01:11:57,484
Irvine's at home with a broken collarbone.

1042
01:11:57,592 --> 01:11:59,719
He don't own this place. I do.

1043
01:12:01,897 --> 01:12:05,390
- How much money's he getting for this?
- There is no money.

1044
01:12:05,468 --> 01:12:08,265
- Free to all.
- Ain't that something?

1045
01:12:08,336 --> 01:12:10,201
It is, actually.

1046
01:12:10,272 --> 01:12:12,707
Look, stupid fuck!

1047
01:12:12,808 --> 01:12:15,333
- I want everybody out of here right now.
- Hey!

1048
01:12:15,444 --> 01:12:17,674
You should join our club.

1049
01:12:18,048 --> 01:12:20,038
Did you hear what I just said?

1050
01:12:20,116 --> 01:12:22,243
You and your friend.

1051
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:26,248
You hear me now?

1052
01:12:28,458 --> 01:12:30,516
No, I didn't quite catch that, Lou.

1053
01:12:36,667 --> 01:12:38,658
Still not getting it.

1054
01:12:39,703 --> 01:12:41,864
OK, OK, I got it.

1055
01:12:41,939 --> 01:12:44,430
I got it, I got it. Shit, I lost it.

1056
01:12:45,475 --> 01:12:47,340
Back! All of you!

1057
01:12:49,047 --> 01:12:51,106
Everybody back!

1058
01:12:58,589 --> 01:13:00,750
Ah, Lou!

1059
01:13:00,858 --> 01:13:04,521
Come on, man!
We really like this place.

1060
01:13:13,572 --> 01:13:16,506
- That's right, Lou. Get it out.
- Shut the fuck up.

1061
01:13:16,607 --> 01:13:18,405
Oh, yeah!

1062
01:13:23,382 --> 01:13:25,475
Is that fucking funny?

1063
01:13:35,028 --> 01:13:37,621
Fucking guy is a loony, I'm telling you.

1064
01:13:38,497 --> 01:13:40,159
Unbelievable.

1065
01:13:44,404 --> 01:13:47,373
- You don't know where I've been, Lou.
- Oh, my God!

1066
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:50,341
You don't know where I've been!

1067
01:13:53,413 --> 01:13:56,508
Please let us keep it, Lou! Please, Lou!

1068
01:13:56,584 --> 01:13:59,017
Fucking use the basement! Christ!

1069
01:13:59,119 --> 01:14:01,987
I want your word, Lou! I want your word!

1070
01:14:02,056 --> 01:14:04,047
On my mother's eyes.

1071
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:15,327
Thanks, Lou.

1072
01:14:16,638 --> 01:14:18,731
You too, big guy.

1073
01:14:22,676 --> 01:14:24,770
We'll see you next week.

1074
01:14:40,263 --> 01:14:43,857
This week, each one of you
has a homework assignment.

1075
01:14:43,965 --> 01:14:48,801
You're gonna go out. You're gonna
start a fight with a total stranger.

1076
01:14:52,041 --> 01:14:54,202
You're gonna start a fight

1077
01:14:54,310 --> 01:14:56,403
and you're gonna lose.

1078
01:14:58,381 --> 01:15:00,316
Excellent choice, sir.

1079
01:15:02,886 --> 01:15:06,184
Hey! Watch out, jackass! Come on!

1080
01:15:06,589 --> 01:15:09,218
<i>Now, this is not as easy as it sounds.</i>

1081
01:15:11,929 --> 01:15:13,897
Son of a bitch!

1082
01:15:13,997 --> 01:15:18,730
<i>Most people, normal people,
do just about anything to avoid a fight.</i>

1083
01:15:19,670 --> 01:15:21,730
Excuse me!

1084
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:25,537
You sprayed me with your hose.
That's not necessary...

1085
01:15:25,643 --> 01:15:27,542
Jay! Go call 911!

1086
01:15:30,281 --> 01:15:32,340
Put the hose down.

1087
01:15:32,450 --> 01:15:34,509
Stop it! Stop it!

1088
01:15:36,154 --> 01:15:38,054
Sorry.

1089
01:15:53,572 --> 01:15:56,040
We need to talk.

1090
01:15:58,277 --> 01:16:00,370
OK.

1091
01:16:00,479 --> 01:16:02,538
Where to begin?

1092
01:16:02,648 --> 01:16:04,843
With your constant absenteeism?

1093
01:16:04,917 --> 01:16:07,478
With your unpresentable appearance?

1094
01:16:07,554 --> 01:16:09,579
You're up for review.

1095
01:16:09,688 --> 01:16:12,885
I am Jack's complete lack of surprise.

1096
01:16:12,958 --> 01:16:14,893
- What?
- Let's pretend.

1097
01:16:14,961 --> 01:16:17,862
You're the Department of Transportation,
OK?

1098
01:16:17,931 --> 01:16:21,594
Someone informs you that this company

1099
01:16:21,701 --> 01:16:25,762
installs front-seat mounting brackets
that failed collision tests,

1100
01:16:25,872 --> 01:16:29,274
brake linings that fail after 1,000 miles,

1101
01:16:29,343 --> 01:16:33,779
and fuel injectors
that explode and burn people alive.

1102
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:35,746
What then?

1103
01:16:35,816 --> 01:16:38,114
Are you threatening me?

1104
01:16:38,186 --> 01:16:40,984
- No...
- Get the fuck out of here. You're fired!

1105
01:16:41,088 --> 01:16:45,525
I have a better solution. Keep me
on the payroll as an outside consultant.

1106
01:16:45,593 --> 01:16:47,686
In exchange for my salary,

1107
01:16:47,762 --> 01:16:51,597
my job will be never to tell people
these things that I know.

1108
01:16:51,700 --> 01:16:55,965
I don't even have to come into the office.
I can do this job from home.

1109
01:16:57,239 --> 01:17:01,369
Who... Who the fuck do you think you are,
you crazy little shit?

1110
01:17:06,648 --> 01:17:10,175
<i>- Security!
- I am Jack's smirking revenge.</i>

1111
01:17:19,161 --> 01:17:21,255
What the hell are you doing?

1112
01:17:30,473 --> 01:17:32,566
That hurt.

1113
01:17:34,011 --> 01:17:36,070
Why would you do that?

1114
01:17:36,747 --> 01:17:39,738
Oh, my God! No! Please stop!

1115
01:17:49,093 --> 01:17:51,186
What are you doing?

1116
01:17:52,263 --> 01:17:54,356
Oh, God, no! Please! No!

1117
01:17:54,431 --> 01:17:58,562
<i>For some reason,
I thought of my first fight, with Tyler.</i>

1118
01:17:58,637 --> 01:18:00,228
No!

1119
01:18:24,663 --> 01:18:29,124
<i>Under and behind and inside
everything this man took for granted,</i>

1120
01:18:29,235 --> 01:18:32,693
<i>something horrible had been growing.</i>

1121
01:18:32,805 --> 01:18:33,863
Look.

1122
01:18:33,939 --> 01:18:38,672
Give me the paychecks, like I asked,
and you won't ever see me again.

1123
01:18:38,744 --> 01:18:41,543
<i>Then, at our most excellent
moment together...</i>

1124
01:18:44,617 --> 01:18:47,347
Thank God!
Please don't hit me again.

1125
01:18:47,454 --> 01:18:49,547
<i>Telephone, computer,</i>

1126
01:18:49,656 --> 01:18:54,821
<i>fax machine, 52 weekly paychecks
and 48 airline flight coupons.</i>

1127
01:18:54,895 --> 01:18:57,295
<i>We now had corporate sponsorship.</i>

1128
01:18:57,364 --> 01:19:02,530
<i>This is how Tyler and I were able to have
Fight Club every night of the week.</i>

1129
01:19:05,172 --> 01:19:08,767
<i>Now, the center of Fight Club
became the two men fighting.</i>

1130
01:19:08,875 --> 01:19:12,334
<i>The leader walked through the crowd,
out in the darkness.</i>

1131
01:19:14,115 --> 01:19:18,643
<i>Tyler was now involved in
a lawsuit with the Pressman Hotel</i>

1132
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:20,984
<i>over the urine content of their soup.</i>

1133
01:19:26,161 --> 01:19:29,152
<i>I am Jack's wasted life.</i>

1134
01:19:36,905 --> 01:19:38,964
Thank you, sir.

1135
01:19:40,476 --> 01:19:43,468
<i>Tyler dreamed up
new homework assignments.</i>

1136
01:19:43,579 --> 01:19:46,104
<i>He handed them out in sealed envelopes.</i>

1137
01:20:25,256 --> 01:20:28,953
- There's a Fight Club up in Delaware City.
- Yeah, I heard.

1138
01:20:30,762 --> 01:20:32,956
There's one in Penns Grove too.

1139
01:20:33,030 --> 01:20:35,260
Bob even found one up in New Castle.

1140
01:20:35,366 --> 01:20:38,427
- Did you start that one?
- No, I thought you did.

1141
01:20:38,537 --> 01:20:41,028
No.

1142
01:21:29,890 --> 01:21:32,085
- Stop for a second.
- Hey, what are we doing?

1143
01:21:32,192 --> 01:21:34,217
- Turn around.
- What are we doing?

1144
01:21:34,294 --> 01:21:36,729
- Homework assignment.
- What kind?

1145
01:21:36,831 --> 01:21:38,855
Human sacrifice.

1146
01:21:38,932 --> 01:21:42,265
- Is that a gun? Please tell me it's not.
- It's a gun.

1147
01:21:42,336 --> 01:21:44,703
- What are you doing?
- Meet me in the back.

1148
01:21:44,806 --> 01:21:47,138
- Don't fuck around!
- Meet me in the back.

1149
01:21:47,242 --> 01:21:49,039
<i>On a long enough time line,</i>

1150
01:21:49,110 --> 01:21:52,011
<i>the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.</i>

1151
01:21:53,014 --> 01:21:55,073
What are you doing? Come on!

1152
01:21:55,149 --> 01:21:58,551
Hands behind your back.
Give me your wallet.

1153
01:22:00,322 --> 01:22:03,620
Raymond K Hessel.
1320 SE Banning, Apartment A.

1154
01:22:04,425 --> 01:22:07,623
- Small, cramped basement apartment?
- How did you know?

1155
01:22:07,730 --> 01:22:10,324
They give shitty apartments letters.

1156
01:22:10,432 --> 01:22:13,526
Raymond! You're going to die.

1157
01:22:13,636 --> 01:22:15,103
No!

1158
01:22:15,170 --> 01:22:19,334
Is that your mom and dad?
They're gonna have to call the kindly doctor.

1159
01:22:19,441 --> 01:22:21,706
Pick up your dental records. Know why?

1160
01:22:21,778 --> 01:22:25,338
- There'll be nothing left of your face.
- Oh, come on!

1161
01:22:25,447 --> 01:22:29,350
An expired community college student ID.
What did you study, Raymond?

1162
01:22:29,452 --> 01:22:32,478
- S... S... Stuff.
- Stuff?

1163
01:22:32,556 --> 01:22:34,648
Were the midterms hard?

1164
01:22:35,792 --> 01:22:38,352
- I asked you what you studied!
- Biology, mostly.

1165
01:22:38,461 --> 01:22:41,953
- Why?
- I don't know.

1166
01:22:42,065 --> 01:22:45,057
What did you wanna be, Raymond K Hessel?!

1167
01:22:46,469 --> 01:22:50,406
The question, Raymond,
was what did you want to be?

1168
01:22:52,109 --> 01:22:54,168
Answer him, Raymond, Jesus!

1169
01:22:54,278 --> 01:22:56,677
- Veterinarian. Veterinarian.
- Animals.

1170
01:22:56,780 --> 01:22:59,750
- Yeah. Animals and stuff.
- Stuff. Yeah, I got that.

1171
01:22:59,817 --> 01:23:02,377
- So you need more schooling.
- Too much school.

1172
01:23:02,486 --> 01:23:04,955
- Would you rather be dead?
- No, please...

1173
01:23:05,023 --> 01:23:09,482
You'd rather die here, on your knees,
in the back of a convenience store?

1174
01:23:09,560 --> 01:23:11,187
Please, no.

1175
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:17,359
I'm keeping your license.

1176
01:23:18,603 --> 01:23:21,596
Gonna check in on you.
I know where you live.

1177
01:23:21,707 --> 01:23:24,699
If you're not working
to be a veterinarian in six weeks,

1178
01:23:24,810 --> 01:23:26,904
you will be dead.

1179
01:23:28,780 --> 01:23:30,839
Now run on home.

1180
01:23:35,588 --> 01:23:37,647
Run, Forrest, run!

1181
01:23:39,325 --> 01:23:41,384
I feel ill.

1182
01:23:42,195 --> 01:23:44,254
Imagine how he feels.

1183
01:23:44,364 --> 01:23:46,423
Come on, this isn't funny!

1184
01:23:46,532 --> 01:23:48,967
What the fuck was the point of that?!

1185
01:23:49,036 --> 01:23:53,165
Tomorrow will be the most beautiful day
of Raymond K Hessel's life.

1186
01:23:53,239 --> 01:23:57,609
His breakfast will taste better
than any meal you and I have ever tasted.

1187
01:23:59,046 --> 01:24:01,139
<i>You had to give it to him.</i>

1188
01:24:01,215 --> 01:24:03,581
<i>- Come on.
- He had a plan.</i>

1189
01:24:03,651 --> 01:24:07,087
<i>And it started to make sense
in a Tyler-sort of way.</i>

1190
01:24:07,187 --> 01:24:09,087
<i>No fear. No distractions.</i>

1191
01:24:09,189 --> 01:24:12,488
<i>The ability to let that which does not matter</i>

1192
01:24:12,593 --> 01:24:14,584
<i>truly slide.</i>

1193
01:24:28,009 --> 01:24:30,102
<i>You are not your job.</i>

1194
01:24:32,047 --> 01:24:35,414
You're not how much money
you have in the bank.

1195
01:24:37,118 --> 01:24:39,211
You're not the car you drive.

1196
01:24:39,721 --> 01:24:42,589
You're not the contents of your wallet.

1197
01:24:42,658 --> 01:24:44,990
You're not your fucking khakis.

1198
01:24:47,830 --> 01:24:51,493
You are the all-singing,
all-dancing crap of the world.

1199
01:25:00,342 --> 01:25:02,538
I'll be out of your way in a sec.

1200
01:25:03,346 --> 01:25:05,439
You don't have to go.

1201
01:25:06,950 --> 01:25:09,042
Whatever.

1202
01:25:10,153 --> 01:25:13,247
No, I mean... It's OK.

1203
01:25:22,766 --> 01:25:24,894
Are you still going to groups?

1204
01:25:25,570 --> 01:25:27,663
Yeah.

1205
01:25:29,139 --> 01:25:31,232
Chloe's dead.

1206
01:25:31,709 --> 01:25:33,700
Wow, Chloe.

1207
01:25:33,778 --> 01:25:35,712
When did that happen?

1208
01:25:36,280 --> 01:25:38,145
Do you care?

1209
01:25:38,249 --> 01:25:41,582
I dunno. I haven't thought about it in a while.

1210
01:25:41,886 --> 01:25:43,945
Yeah, well...

1211
01:25:44,055 --> 01:25:46,388
It was the smart move on her part.

1212
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:49,785
Listen...

1213
01:25:51,095 --> 01:25:53,462
What are you getting out of all this?

1214
01:25:54,166 --> 01:25:56,259
What?

1215
01:25:56,368 --> 01:25:58,700
I mean, all this. Why do you keep...

1216
01:25:59,471 --> 01:26:01,531
Is this making you happy?

1217
01:26:03,142 --> 01:26:05,201
Yeah, well, sometimes.

1218
01:26:06,945 --> 01:26:09,073
I don't know. I don't understand.

1219
01:26:09,149 --> 01:26:12,710
Why does a weaker person
need to latch on to a strong person?

1220
01:26:12,786 --> 01:26:14,912
What is... What is that?

1221
01:26:14,987 --> 01:26:17,149
What do you get out of it?

1222
01:26:18,625 --> 01:26:20,718
No... That's not the same thing at all.

1223
01:26:20,794 --> 01:26:22,922
It's totally different with us.

1224
01:26:22,997 --> 01:26:25,089
Us?

1225
01:26:25,165 --> 01:26:27,099
What do you mean by us?

1226
01:26:27,167 --> 01:26:31,036
- I'm sorry. Do you hear this?
- Hear what?

1227
01:26:31,138 --> 01:26:33,163
- All that noise. Hold on.
- No, wait!

1228
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:35,969
Don't change the subject!
I want to talk about this.

1229
01:26:36,042 --> 01:26:38,807
- You're not talking about me, are you?
- No.

1230
01:26:38,946 --> 01:26:42,382
- What?
- Playing doctor. What was going on there?

1231
01:26:42,449 --> 01:26:45,715
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing. Nothing.

1232
01:26:45,787 --> 01:26:47,845
- I don't think so.
- What do you want?

1233
01:26:47,988 --> 01:26:50,388
- Look at me.
- No. What?

1234
01:26:51,158 --> 01:26:53,992
- What is that?!
- It's nothing. Don't worry.

1235
01:26:54,062 --> 01:26:56,462
My God. Who did this?

1236
01:26:56,565 --> 01:26:58,623
- A person.
- Guy or girl?

1237
01:26:58,732 --> 01:27:01,531
- What do you care?
- What do you care if I ask?

1238
01:27:01,603 --> 01:27:04,197
- Leave me alone.
- You're afraid to say.

1239
01:27:04,272 --> 01:27:06,263
- I am not. Let me go.
- No! Talk to me.

1240
01:27:06,374 --> 01:27:07,535
Let go of me!

1241
01:27:07,610 --> 01:27:10,339
- This conversation
- This conversation

1242
01:27:10,412 --> 01:27:12,880
- is over.
- is over.

1243
01:27:13,748 --> 01:27:16,843
I just can't win with you, can I?

1244
01:27:26,195 --> 01:27:28,663
Hey, this is getting a little old!

1245
01:27:29,266 --> 01:27:31,597
What is... What is all this?

1246
01:27:31,667 --> 01:27:33,760
What do you think?

1247
01:27:34,704 --> 01:27:36,832
Hey, why do we need bunk beds?

1248
01:27:36,907 --> 01:27:38,772
Hey!

1249
01:27:45,616 --> 01:27:47,447
Too young.

1250
01:27:47,517 --> 01:27:49,178
Sorry.

1251
01:27:49,253 --> 01:27:51,313
What's all that?

1252
01:27:51,422 --> 01:27:54,390
If the applicant is young,
tell him he's too young.

1253
01:27:54,458 --> 01:27:57,086
- Old, too old. Fat, too fat.
- Applicant?

1254
01:27:57,194 --> 01:28:00,528
If the applicant waits three days
without food or shelter,

1255
01:28:00,632 --> 01:28:02,691
he may enter and begin training.

1256
01:28:02,799 --> 01:28:04,630
Training for what?

1257
01:28:10,241 --> 01:28:12,300
You think this is a game?

1258
01:28:12,410 --> 01:28:15,072
You're too young to train here, end of story.

1259
01:28:15,146 --> 01:28:17,876
Quit wasting our time.
Get the fuck out of here.

1260
01:28:21,820 --> 01:28:23,879
Bad news, friend.

1261
01:28:24,156 --> 01:28:26,248
It's not gonna happen.

1262
01:28:26,324 --> 01:28:28,623
Sorry if there was a misunderstanding.

1263
01:28:28,694 --> 01:28:30,628
It's not the end of the world.

1264
01:28:30,696 --> 01:28:32,891
Just... go away.

1265
01:28:33,766 --> 01:28:35,825
Go.

1266
01:28:35,901 --> 01:28:39,564
You're trespassing
and I will have to call the police.

1267
01:28:42,676 --> 01:28:44,735
Don't you look at me!

1268
01:28:44,844 --> 01:28:48,108
You're never getting in this fucking house!

1269
01:28:48,180 --> 01:28:51,548
Never. Now get the fuck off my porch!
Get off my porch!

1270
01:28:51,651 --> 01:28:55,178
<i>Sooner or later,
we all became what Tyler wanted us to be.</i>

1271
01:28:55,288 --> 01:28:58,121
I'm gonna go inside
and I'm gonna get a shovel.

1272
01:29:05,666 --> 01:29:07,861
- Got two black shirts?
- Yes, sir.

1273
01:29:07,935 --> 01:29:10,198
- Two pair of black pants?
- Yes, sir.

1274
01:29:10,303 --> 01:29:13,273
- One pair black boots? Black socks?
- Yes, sir.

1275
01:29:13,341 --> 01:29:15,400
- One blackjacket.
- Yes, sir.

1276
01:29:15,509 --> 01:29:18,501
- $300 personal burial money?
- Yes, sir.

1277
01:29:20,681 --> 01:29:22,740
All right.

1278
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:34,620
You're too old, fat man.

1279
01:29:34,730 --> 01:29:37,893
Your tits are too big.
Get the fuck off my porch.

1280
01:29:45,707 --> 01:29:47,766
Bob! Bob!

1281
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:06,422
Like a monkey ready to be shot into space.

1282
01:30:07,196 --> 01:30:08,663
Space monkey.

1283
01:30:08,765 --> 01:30:12,258
Ready to sacrifice himself
for the greater good.

1284
01:30:18,876 --> 01:30:21,572
You are too fucking old, fatty!

1285
01:30:21,645 --> 01:30:24,842
And you... You're too fucking

1286
01:30:24,948 --> 01:30:26,575
blond!

1287
01:30:26,650 --> 01:30:28,982
Get out of here, the both of you!

1288
01:30:29,053 --> 01:30:31,180
<i>And so it went.</i>

1289
01:30:31,355 --> 01:30:33,449
Listen up, maggots.

1290
01:30:33,558 --> 01:30:35,617
You are not special.

1291
01:30:35,960 --> 01:30:39,258
You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake.

1292
01:30:39,363 --> 01:30:43,698
You are the same decaying organic matter
as everything else.

1293
01:30:43,802 --> 01:30:45,895
<i>Tyler built himself an army.</i>

1294
01:30:46,171 --> 01:30:49,800
<i>We are the all-singing,
all-dancing crap of the world.</i>

1295
01:30:49,874 --> 01:30:53,503
<i>We are all part of the same compost heap.</i>

1296
01:30:54,579 --> 01:30:57,811
<i>Why was Tyler Durden building an army?</i>

1297
01:30:57,883 --> 01:30:59,975
<i>To what purpose?</i>

1298
01:31:00,051 --> 01:31:02,486
<i>For what greater good?</i>

1299
01:31:05,825 --> 01:31:07,884
<i>In Tyler we trusted.</i>

1300
01:31:13,232 --> 01:31:15,894
When he was like,
"You are not yourjob",

1301
01:31:16,001 --> 01:31:18,061
I was like, "Yeah!"

1302
01:31:19,940 --> 01:31:22,032
Hey, what's all this?

1303
01:31:22,141 --> 01:31:24,235
Hey!

1304
01:31:25,712 --> 01:31:27,407
OK!

1305
01:31:27,481 --> 01:31:29,847
- What's going on?
- We're celebrating.

1306
01:31:29,916 --> 01:31:32,441
- What are we celebrating?
- Go on.

1307
01:31:36,456 --> 01:31:38,617
- Hey.
- Let me get that for you.

1308
01:31:43,230 --> 01:31:46,098
<i>The same great taste, Pepsi.</i>

1309
01:31:48,469 --> 01:31:50,699
Ssh!

1310
01:31:50,771 --> 01:31:54,571
<i>Investigators are here.
The Police Commissioner has arrived.</i>

1311
01:31:54,675 --> 01:31:57,644
<i>Could you tell us
what you think has happened here?</i>

1312
01:31:57,712 --> 01:32:01,945
<i>We believe this is one of many
recent acts of vandalism in the city</i>

1313
01:32:02,050 --> 01:32:05,177
<i>somehow related
to underground boxing clubs.</i>

1314
01:32:05,286 --> 01:32:09,485
<i>We will be coordinating
a rigorous investigation.</i>

1315
01:32:10,392 --> 01:32:14,761
<i>That was Police Commissioner Jacobs
who just arrived on the scene</i>

1316
01:32:14,863 --> 01:32:19,095
<i>- of a four-alarm fire that broke out...
- She's hot.</i>

1317
01:32:19,201 --> 01:32:20,998
<i>Back to you in the studio.</i>

1318
01:32:21,103 --> 01:32:23,504
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1319
01:32:24,474 --> 01:32:26,964
- Holy shit!
- Yeah!

1320
01:32:34,317 --> 01:32:36,342
What the fuck did you guys do?

1321
01:32:36,419 --> 01:32:40,515
<i>Arson investigators
are on the premises...</i>

1322
01:32:44,294 --> 01:32:48,822
Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem
is you do not ask questions, sir.

1323
01:32:55,039 --> 01:32:57,564
The victory in the war against crime

1324
01:32:57,641 --> 01:32:59,734
will not come overnight.

1325
01:32:59,810 --> 01:33:04,372
It will take dedication and commitment
and, most of all, cooperation.

1326
01:33:04,448 --> 01:33:09,386
Streets are safer now.
There is hope in the inner city. However...

1327
01:33:09,454 --> 01:33:11,444
I gotta take a piss.

1328
01:33:11,555 --> 01:33:14,320
These are the first steps in a long journey.

1329
01:33:14,392 --> 01:33:16,986
That is why we have created Project Hope.

1330
01:33:17,062 --> 01:33:19,155
Bob.

1331
01:33:22,267 --> 01:33:25,031
Project Hope will be ajoint effort

1332
01:33:25,136 --> 01:33:27,866
between the police and community leaders.

1333
01:33:27,973 --> 01:33:32,137
It will be a powerful new weapon
in the war against crime.

1334
01:34:17,591 --> 01:34:21,722
- Wrap it around the top of his Hacky Sack.
- His balls are ice cold.

1335
01:34:23,731 --> 01:34:27,063
Hi. You're gonna call off
your rigorous investigation.

1336
01:34:27,134 --> 01:34:30,502
You will publicly state
there is no underground group or

1337
01:34:30,605 --> 01:34:32,903
these guys are gonna take your balls.

1338
01:34:33,808 --> 01:34:37,609
<i>They'll send one to the New York Times
and one to the LA Times.</i>

1339
01:34:37,680 --> 01:34:39,442
Look.

1340
01:34:39,514 --> 01:34:42,609
The people you are after
are the people you depend on.

1341
01:34:42,685 --> 01:34:46,246
We cook your meals. We haul your trash.
We connect your calls.

1342
01:34:46,355 --> 01:34:50,086
We drive your ambulances.
We guard you while you sleep.

1343
01:34:54,530 --> 01:34:57,329
Do not fuck with us.

1344
01:35:04,741 --> 01:35:06,868
Ball check!

1345
01:35:21,192 --> 01:35:23,284
Bob, you're this way.

1346
01:35:24,394 --> 01:35:26,727
Let's go.

1347
01:35:26,797 --> 01:35:29,994
<i>I am Jack's inflamed sense of rejection.</i>

1348
01:35:31,102 --> 01:35:33,160
Hey!

1349
01:35:47,685 --> 01:35:48,948
Yeah!

1350
01:36:21,721 --> 01:36:24,519
<i>I felt like putting a bullet in every panda</i>

1351
01:36:24,590 --> 01:36:28,458
<i>that wouldn't screw to save its species.</i>

1352
01:36:30,596 --> 01:36:33,361
<i>I wanted to open the dump valves
on oil tankers</i>

1353
01:36:33,467 --> 01:36:36,334
<i>and smother those French beaches
I'd never see.</i>

1354
01:36:39,605 --> 01:36:42,074
<i>I wanted to breathe smoke.</i>

1355
01:36:59,461 --> 01:37:01,587
Where did you go, psycho boy?

1356
01:37:03,298 --> 01:37:06,233
I felt like destroying something beautiful.

1357
01:37:09,772 --> 01:37:11,830
Get him to a fucking hospital.

1358
01:37:11,906 --> 01:37:13,999
Yeah.

1359
01:37:24,787 --> 01:37:27,847
Don't worry, Mr Durden.
Airport parking. Long term.

1360
01:37:29,325 --> 01:37:31,453
After you, Mr Durden.

1361
01:37:32,395 --> 01:37:34,487
After you.

1362
01:37:52,249 --> 01:37:54,844
- Something on your mind, dear?
- No.

1363
01:37:54,919 --> 01:37:58,149
Yeah, why wasn't I told
about Project Mayhem?

1364
01:37:58,255 --> 01:38:01,248
First rule of Project Mayhem
is you do not ask questions.

1365
01:38:01,325 --> 01:38:03,725
Why didn't you include me in the beginning?

1366
01:38:03,828 --> 01:38:09,027
Fight Club was the beginning. Now it's left
the basements and it's Project Mayhem.

1367
01:38:09,100 --> 01:38:13,503
We started Fight Club together. Remember?
It's as much mine as it is yours.

1368
01:38:13,571 --> 01:38:17,837
- Is this about you and me?
- Yeah. Weren't we doing this together?

1369
01:38:17,909 --> 01:38:21,345
This does not belong to us.
We are not special.

1370
01:38:21,445 --> 01:38:23,880
Fuck that. You should have told me.

1371
01:38:24,716 --> 01:38:26,707
Hey, Tyler!

1372
01:38:28,553 --> 01:38:31,045
- Goddamn it, Tyler!
- What do you want?!

1373
01:38:31,123 --> 01:38:33,591
A statement of purpose?
Should I e-mail you?

1374
01:38:33,692 --> 01:38:36,320
- Oh...
- You decide your level of involvement!

1375
01:38:36,395 --> 01:38:39,091
I will! I wanna know certain things first!

1376
01:38:39,164 --> 01:38:41,792
- The first rule of Project Mayhem...
- Shut up!

1377
01:38:43,569 --> 01:38:47,301
- I wanna know what you're thinking.
- Fuck what you know!

1378
01:38:47,373 --> 01:38:50,864
Forget about what you think you know
about life, friendship,

1379
01:38:50,943 --> 01:38:53,003
and especially about you and me.

1380
01:38:54,180 --> 01:38:56,341
What is that supposed to mean?

1381
01:38:59,753 --> 01:39:01,913
What are you doing?

1382
01:39:02,822 --> 01:39:05,552
What do you wish you'd done
before you died?

1383
01:39:05,625 --> 01:39:08,493
- Paint a self-portrait.
- Build a house.

1384
01:39:08,596 --> 01:39:10,962
- And you?
- I don't know. Nothing.

1385
01:39:11,031 --> 01:39:13,430
- Get in the right lane.
- You have to know!

1386
01:39:13,566 --> 01:39:16,593
If you died now,
how would you feel about your life?

1387
01:39:16,704 --> 01:39:20,333
I don't know! Nothing good.
Is that what you want to hear?

1388
01:39:20,407 --> 01:39:22,740
- Come on!
- Not good enough.

1389
01:39:22,811 --> 01:39:25,244
Stop fucking around! Tyler!

1390
01:39:26,513 --> 01:39:28,777
Jesus Christ!

1391
01:39:29,517 --> 01:39:31,610
Goddamn it! Goddamn it! Fuck you!

1392
01:39:31,720 --> 01:39:33,779
Fuck Fight Club. Fuck Marla!

1393
01:39:33,855 --> 01:39:36,517
I am sick of all your shit!

1394
01:39:36,625 --> 01:39:38,525
OK, man.

1395
01:39:40,328 --> 01:39:42,853
- Quit screwing around. Steer!
- Look at you!

1396
01:39:42,964 --> 01:39:45,728
- Steer!
- Look at you. You're fucking pathetic!

1397
01:39:45,800 --> 01:39:50,932
- Why? Why? What are you talking about?
- Why do you think I blew up your condo?

1398
01:39:51,540 --> 01:39:53,064
What?

1399
01:39:53,175 --> 01:39:57,076
Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat.
It's not a goddamned seminar.

1400
01:39:57,178 --> 01:40:00,876
Stop trying to control everything
and just let go!

1401
01:40:02,618 --> 01:40:04,449
Let go!

1402
01:40:04,553 --> 01:40:06,647
All right. Fine.

1403
01:40:07,490 --> 01:40:09,424
Fine.

1404
01:41:07,820 --> 01:41:10,288
<i>I'd never been in a car accident.</i>

1405
01:41:10,355 --> 01:41:13,813
<i>This must have been
what all those people felt like</i>

1406
01:41:13,892 --> 01:41:17,089
<i>before I filed them
as statistics in my reports.</i>

1407
01:41:17,162 --> 01:41:19,256
Goddamn!

1408
01:41:22,769 --> 01:41:25,931
We've just had a near-life experience!

1409
01:41:29,776 --> 01:41:31,767
In the world I see,

1410
01:41:31,878 --> 01:41:35,746
you're stalking elk
through the Grand Canyon forests

1411
01:41:35,849 --> 01:41:38,841
around the ruins of Rockefeller Center.

1412
01:41:40,854 --> 01:41:45,189
You'll wear leather clothes
that will last you the rest of your life.

1413
01:41:45,292 --> 01:41:49,854
You'll climb the thick kudzu vines
that wrap the Sears Tower.

1414
01:41:49,930 --> 01:41:54,492
And when you look down,
you'll see tiny figures pounding corn,

1415
01:41:54,568 --> 01:41:58,129
laying strips of venison
in the empty car-pool lane

1416
01:41:58,205 --> 01:42:00,503
of some abandoned superhighway.

1417
01:42:13,955 --> 01:42:16,185
Feel better, champ.

1418
01:42:33,543 --> 01:42:35,340
<i>And then...</i>

1419
01:42:35,411 --> 01:42:36,969
Tyler?

1420
01:42:37,046 --> 01:42:39,139
<i>..Tyler was gone.</i>

1421
01:42:46,522 --> 01:42:48,548
<i>Was I asleep?</i>

1422
01:42:49,626 --> 01:42:51,650
<i>Had I slept?</i>

1423
01:42:51,794 --> 01:42:54,821
You are not a beautiful, unique snowflake...

1424
01:42:54,932 --> 01:42:57,366
<i>The house had become a living thing.</i>

1425
01:42:57,434 --> 01:43:02,065
<i>Wet inside from so many people
sweating and breathing.</i>

1426
01:43:02,573 --> 01:43:05,167
<i>So many people moving, the house moved.</i>

1427
01:43:08,045 --> 01:43:10,139
<i>Planet Tyler.</i>

1428
01:43:10,215 --> 01:43:12,274
<i>I had to hug the walls.</i>

1429
01:43:12,383 --> 01:43:15,476
<i>Trapped inside
this clockwork of space monkeys.</i>

1430
01:43:15,586 --> 01:43:19,387
You shouldn't be smoking in here!
You know how much ether is here!

1431
01:43:19,457 --> 01:43:21,982
<i>Cooking and working and sleeping in teams.</i>

1432
01:43:24,230 --> 01:43:26,288
Hang on a second.

1433
01:43:45,217 --> 01:43:47,913
It's under control, sir.

1434
01:43:50,389 --> 01:43:52,220
Where's Tyler?

1435
01:43:52,291 --> 01:43:55,284
Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem
is you do not...

1436
01:43:55,395 --> 01:43:57,328
Right... OK.

1437
01:43:59,732 --> 01:44:01,860
<i>I'm all alone.</i>

1438
01:44:02,035 --> 01:44:05,664
<i>My father dumped me. Tyler dumped me.</i>

1439
01:44:05,805 --> 01:44:08,036
<i>I am Jack's broken heart.</i>

1440
01:44:12,245 --> 01:44:16,046
<i>What comes next in Project Mayhem
only Tyler knows.</i>

1441
01:44:16,951 --> 01:44:20,147
<i>The second rule is you do not ask questions.</i>

1442
01:44:22,957 --> 01:44:25,653
Get the fuck away from me!
Get the fuck away!

1443
01:44:26,060 --> 01:44:28,119
Who are all these people?

1444
01:44:33,367 --> 01:44:35,665
The Paper Street Soap Company.

1445
01:44:37,238 --> 01:44:39,298
Can I come in?

1446
01:44:42,443 --> 01:44:44,502
He's not here.

1447
01:44:44,578 --> 01:44:46,843
What?

1448
01:44:47,883 --> 01:44:51,444
Tyler isn't here.

1449
01:44:51,520 --> 01:44:53,579
Tyler went away.

1450
01:44:54,056 --> 01:44:56,115
Tyler's gone.

1451
01:45:13,142 --> 01:45:14,871
Get some help!

1452
01:45:26,022 --> 01:45:30,926
Two gunshot wounds coming through!
Make some fucking room!

1453
01:45:30,995 --> 01:45:33,395
What happened? What happened?

1454
01:45:33,497 --> 01:45:36,364
We were on assignment. We were supposed
to kill two birds with one stone.

1455
01:45:37,634 --> 01:45:39,727
Destroy a piece of corporate art...

1456
01:45:39,803 --> 01:45:42,328
Operation Latte Thunder. Go!

1457
01:45:43,040 --> 01:45:46,204
..and trash a franchise coffee bar.

1458
01:45:52,617 --> 01:45:54,983
We had it all worked out, sir.

1459
01:46:03,161 --> 01:46:06,427
- It went smooth until...
- Police! Freeze!

1460
01:46:06,532 --> 01:46:09,261
- What?
- They shot Bob.

1461
01:46:10,769 --> 01:46:13,204
- They shot him in the head.
- Fucking pigs!

1462
01:46:18,577 --> 01:46:20,602
Oh, God!

1463
01:46:20,679 --> 01:46:23,978
- Those motherfuckers!
- You morons.

1464
01:46:24,050 --> 01:46:28,181
You're running around in ski masks
trying to blow things up?

1465
01:46:28,255 --> 01:46:30,950
What did you think was gonna happen?!

1466
01:46:32,691 --> 01:46:37,061
OK, quick! Get rid of the evidence.
We gotta get rid of this body!

1467
01:46:37,164 --> 01:46:40,031
- Bury him.
- What?

1468
01:46:40,100 --> 01:46:42,364
Take him to the garden and bury him.

1469
01:46:42,436 --> 01:46:45,303
- Come on, people, let's go!
- Get the fuck off!

1470
01:46:45,405 --> 01:46:48,636
Get away from him!
What are you talking about?

1471
01:46:48,708 --> 01:46:51,303
This isn't fucking evidence.
This is a person.

1472
01:46:51,412 --> 01:46:54,608
He's my friend
and you're not burying him in the garden!

1473
01:46:54,681 --> 01:46:57,674
He was killed serving Project Mayhem, sir.

1474
01:46:57,785 --> 01:46:59,810
- This is Bob.
- Sir, in...

1475
01:46:59,887 --> 01:47:02,014
In Project Mayhem, we have no names.

1476
01:47:02,090 --> 01:47:04,080
Now, you listen to me.

1477
01:47:04,191 --> 01:47:08,686
This is a man and he has a name,
and it's Robert Paulsen, OK?

1478
01:47:08,796 --> 01:47:10,696
- Robert Paulsen.
- He's a man

1479
01:47:10,798 --> 01:47:13,632
and he's dead now because of us.
Do you understand that?

1480
01:47:14,303 --> 01:47:16,600
I understand.

1481
01:47:18,840 --> 01:47:22,208
In death, a member of Project Mayhem

1482
01:47:22,277 --> 01:47:24,336
has a name.

1483
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:27,415
<i>His name is Robert Paulsen.</i>

1484
01:47:27,850 --> 01:47:29,943
His name is Robert Paulsen.

1485
01:47:30,719 --> 01:47:33,415
His name... is Robert Paulsen.

1486
01:47:33,489 --> 01:47:37,323
His name is Robert Paulsen.

1487
01:47:37,426 --> 01:47:40,486
Come on, guys. Please. Stop it.

1488
01:47:40,562 --> 01:47:43,157
His name is Robert Paulsen.

1489
01:47:43,266 --> 01:47:46,326
Shut up! This is all over with!

1490
01:47:49,572 --> 01:47:52,097
Get the fuck out of here.

1491
01:48:20,804 --> 01:48:25,265
- Tyler?
- No, this is Detective Stern of the Arson Unit.

1492
01:48:25,343 --> 01:48:26,901
I need to see you...

1493
01:48:31,416 --> 01:48:35,477
<i>I went to all the cities
on Tyler's used ticket stubs, barhopping.</i>

1494
01:48:35,554 --> 01:48:40,322
<i>I didn't know how or why, but I could look
at 50 different bars, and somehow I just knew.</i>

1495
01:48:40,393 --> 01:48:44,954
<i>I'm looking for Tyler Durden.
It's very important that I talk to him.</i>

1496
01:48:45,096 --> 01:48:46,723
I wish I could help you,

1497
01:48:46,798 --> 01:48:49,131
sir.

1498
01:48:54,406 --> 01:48:56,500
<i>Every city I went to,</i>

1499
01:48:57,543 --> 01:48:59,943
<i>as soon as I set foot off the plane</i>

1500
01:49:00,546 --> 01:49:02,811
<i>I knew a Fight Club was close.</i>

1501
01:49:02,916 --> 01:49:04,576
Hey! Hey!

1502
01:49:05,651 --> 01:49:07,243
Taxi!

1503
01:49:07,353 --> 01:49:09,413
Look at my face. I'm a member.

1504
01:49:09,523 --> 01:49:12,048
Now, I just need to know if you've seen Tyler.

1505
01:49:12,159 --> 01:49:15,821
I'm not exposed to bespeak
any such information to you

1506
01:49:15,928 --> 01:49:20,628
nor would I, even if I had
said information at this juncture,... be able.

1507
01:49:21,335 --> 01:49:24,999
- You're a moron.
- I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

1508
01:49:26,374 --> 01:49:31,402
<i>Tyler had been busy...
setting up franchises all over the country.</i>

1509
01:49:34,182 --> 01:49:38,619
<i>Was I asleep? Had I slept?</i>

1510
01:49:38,686 --> 01:49:40,950
<i>Is Tyler my bad dream, or am I Tyler's?</i>

1511
01:49:42,357 --> 01:49:45,417
- We've just heard the stories.
- What kind of stories?

1512
01:49:45,493 --> 01:49:49,759
- Nobody knows what he looks like.
- He has plastic surgery every three years.

1513
01:49:49,831 --> 01:49:52,857
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

1514
01:49:52,967 --> 01:49:57,029
- Is it true about Fight Club in Miami?
- Is Mr Durden building an army?

1515
01:49:57,172 --> 01:50:00,163
<i>I was living in a state of perpetual dèŒ…jè„¿ vu.</i>

1516
01:50:00,976 --> 01:50:03,035
<i>Everywhere I went,</i>

1517
01:50:03,178 --> 01:50:05,112
<i>I felt I'd already been there.</i>

1518
01:50:05,214 --> 01:50:08,116
<i>It was like following an invisible man.</i>

1519
01:50:09,219 --> 01:50:11,277
<i>The smell of dried blood,</i>

1520
01:50:11,387 --> 01:50:14,879
<i>dirty, bare footprints circling each other.</i>

1521
01:50:15,725 --> 01:50:18,922
<i>That aroma of old sweat, like fried chicken.</i>

1522
01:50:19,029 --> 01:50:22,589
<i>The feel of a floor still warm
from a fight the night before.</i>

1523
01:50:23,466 --> 01:50:26,401
<i>I was always just one step behind Tyler.</i>

1524
01:50:29,306 --> 01:50:32,434
His name is Robert Paulsen...

1525
01:50:37,047 --> 01:50:39,141
Welcome back, sir.

1526
01:50:40,117 --> 01:50:42,210
How have you been?

1527
01:50:42,286 --> 01:50:44,446
Do you know me?

1528
01:50:44,521 --> 01:50:46,922
Is this a test, sir?

1529
01:50:47,024 --> 01:50:48,889
No. This is not a test.

1530
01:50:48,959 --> 01:50:51,223
You were in here last Thursday.

1531
01:50:51,762 --> 01:50:54,061
Thursday?

1532
01:50:54,165 --> 01:50:58,124
You were standing where you are now,
asking how good security is.

1533
01:50:58,769 --> 01:51:00,863
It's tight as a drum, sir.

1534
01:51:03,542 --> 01:51:05,702
Who do you think I am?

1535
01:51:05,776 --> 01:51:08,337
Are you sure this isn't a test?

1536
01:51:08,447 --> 01:51:10,347
No, this is not a test.

1537
01:51:10,449 --> 01:51:12,508
You're Mr Durden.

1538
01:51:13,852 --> 01:51:16,514
You're the one who gave me this.

1539
01:51:16,588 --> 01:51:20,786
<i>Please return your seat backs
to their full upright and locked position.</i>

1540
01:51:32,271 --> 01:51:34,330
<i>- Yeah?
- Marla, it's me.</i>

1541
01:51:34,407 --> 01:51:36,376
<i>- Have we ever done it?
- Done what?</i>

1542
01:51:36,477 --> 01:51:37,808
Had sex?

1543
01:51:37,911 --> 01:51:40,071
What kind of stupid question is that?

1544
01:51:40,179 --> 01:51:42,545
Stupid because it's yes
or because it's no?

1545
01:51:42,615 --> 01:51:45,210
<i>- Is this a trick?
- No. I need to know...</i>

1546
01:51:45,319 --> 01:51:49,186
You wanna know if I think
we were just having sex or making love?

1547
01:51:49,288 --> 01:51:52,690
<i>- We did make love?
- Is that what you're calling it?</i>

1548
01:51:52,760 --> 01:51:55,593
Just answer the question!
Did we do it or not?!

1549
01:51:55,696 --> 01:51:58,598
You fuck me, then snub me.
You love me, you hate me.

1550
01:51:58,700 --> 01:52:01,566
You're sensitive,
then you turn into an asshole.

1551
01:52:01,635 --> 01:52:04,331
Does that describe our relationship, Tyler?

1552
01:52:04,405 --> 01:52:06,499
<i>We just lost cabin pressure.</i>

1553
01:52:06,574 --> 01:52:08,041
What did you just say?

1554
01:52:08,143 --> 01:52:10,509
- What is wrong with you?
- Say my name!

1555
01:52:10,578 --> 01:52:14,241
Tyler Durden!
You fucking freak! What's going on?

1556
01:52:14,349 --> 01:52:16,408
- I'm coming over!
- I'm not there!

1557
01:52:16,518 --> 01:52:19,316
You broke your promise.

1558
01:52:19,387 --> 01:52:21,356
Jesus, Tyler.

1559
01:52:21,424 --> 01:52:24,859
- You fucking talked to her about me.
- What the fuck is going on?

1560
01:52:24,959 --> 01:52:28,418
I asked you for one thing. One simple thing.

1561
01:52:28,531 --> 01:52:30,829
Why do people think that I'm you?

1562
01:52:31,400 --> 01:52:33,458
Answer me!

1563
01:52:35,838 --> 01:52:37,669
Sit.

1564
01:52:40,476 --> 01:52:43,173
Answer me. Why do people think I'm you?

1565
01:52:43,280 --> 01:52:45,440
I think you know.

1566
01:52:45,581 --> 01:52:48,141
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

1567
01:52:48,250 --> 01:52:50,981
Why would anyone
possibly confuse you with me?

1568
01:52:51,054 --> 01:52:53,852
I... I don't know.

1569
01:52:58,628 --> 01:53:01,495
- You got it.
- No.

1570
01:53:01,598 --> 01:53:03,691
- Do not fuck with us!
- Say it.

1571
01:53:05,069 --> 01:53:07,093
Because...

1572
01:53:08,472 --> 01:53:09,632
Say it!

1573
01:53:11,308 --> 01:53:13,368
Because we're the same person.

1574
01:53:13,444 --> 01:53:15,571
That's right.

1575
01:53:15,646 --> 01:53:17,806
<i>We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap.</i>

1576
01:53:17,881 --> 01:53:21,613
- I don't understand this.
- You wanted a way to change your life.

1577
01:53:21,686 --> 01:53:23,779
You could not do this on your own.

1578
01:53:23,855 --> 01:53:25,914
All the ways you wish you could be,

1579
01:53:26,023 --> 01:53:27,888
that's me.

1580
01:53:27,992 --> 01:53:31,120
I look like you wanna look,
I fuck like you wanna fuck.

1581
01:53:31,229 --> 01:53:33,595
I am smart, capable and, most importantly,

1582
01:53:33,664 --> 01:53:36,429
I'm free in all the ways that you are not.

1583
01:53:36,502 --> 01:53:37,491
Oh, no.

1584
01:53:37,603 --> 01:53:40,503
- Tyler's not here. Tyler went away.
- What?

1585
01:53:40,605 --> 01:53:42,904
This isn't possible. This is crazy.

1586
01:53:43,008 --> 01:53:45,033
People do it every day.

1587
01:53:45,110 --> 01:53:48,672
They talk to themselves.
They see themselves as they'd like to be.

1588
01:53:48,748 --> 01:53:52,012
They don't have the courage you have
to just run with it.

1589
01:53:55,822 --> 01:53:59,155
You still wrestle with it,
so sometimes you're still you.

1590
01:53:59,292 --> 01:54:03,956
- We should do this again sometime.
- At times, you imagine you're watching me.

1591
01:54:04,063 --> 01:54:06,554
If this is your first time, you have to fight.

1592
01:54:06,666 --> 01:54:11,036
Little by little,
you're just letting yourself become

1593
01:54:11,871 --> 01:54:13,771
Tyler Durden.

1594
01:54:13,873 --> 01:54:16,671
You are not yourjob
or how much money you have!

1595
01:54:16,743 --> 01:54:19,144
- No. You have a house.
- Rented in your name.

1596
01:54:19,246 --> 01:54:22,874
- You have jobs, a life.
- You work nights because you can't sleep.

1597
01:54:22,949 --> 01:54:24,746
Or you stay up and make soap.

1598
01:54:24,851 --> 01:54:29,789
- You're fucking Marla, Tyler.
- Technically, you are. It's all the same to her.

1599
01:54:31,525 --> 01:54:33,551
Oh, my God.

1600
01:54:34,562 --> 01:54:36,655
Now you see our dilemma.

1601
01:54:36,730 --> 01:54:38,994
She knows too much.

1602
01:54:39,099 --> 01:54:44,197
I think we're gonna have to talk about
how this might compromise our goals.

1603
01:54:44,339 --> 01:54:46,465
What... What are you saying?

1604
01:54:47,409 --> 01:54:51,675
This is bullshit. This is bullshit,
I'm not listening to this!

1605
01:54:51,746 --> 01:54:54,408
- You are insane!
- No. You're insane.

1606
01:54:54,517 --> 01:54:57,212
We simply do not have time for this crap.

1607
01:54:58,720 --> 01:55:00,915
<i>It's called a changeover.</i>

1608
01:55:00,989 --> 01:55:03,083
<i>The movie goes on</i>

1609
01:55:03,159 --> 01:55:06,287
<i>and nobody in the audience has any idea.</i>

1610
01:55:19,241 --> 01:55:22,938
- Sir! Are you checking out?
- Yeah. Bill me.

1611
01:55:23,012 --> 01:55:25,447
Can you initial this list of phone calls?

1612
01:55:29,852 --> 01:55:33,914
- When were these made?
- Between 2.00 and 3.30 this morning.

1613
01:55:39,763 --> 01:55:43,859
<i>Have I been going to bed earlier every night?
Have I been sleeping later?</i>

1614
01:55:43,967 --> 01:55:48,837
<i>Have I been Tyler longer and longer?</i>

1615
01:55:51,341 --> 01:55:53,776
Is anybody here?

1616
01:55:56,447 --> 01:55:58,540
<i>DèŒ…jè„¿ vu all over again.</i>

1617
01:56:00,184 --> 01:56:02,675
With enough soap,
one could blow up anything.

1618
01:56:05,023 --> 01:56:07,082
Oh, my God.

1619
01:56:10,996 --> 01:56:13,361
<i>- 1888.
- Who am I calling?</i>

1620
01:56:13,798 --> 01:56:17,462
<i>1888 Franklin. This is maintenance. Hello?</i>

1621
01:56:18,637 --> 01:56:20,229
<i>Hello?</i>

1622
01:56:20,305 --> 01:56:22,432
1888 Franklin Street?

1623
01:56:22,508 --> 01:56:24,601
<i>Yes. Can I help you?</i>

1624
01:56:27,046 --> 01:56:29,640
<i>- Hello?
- Yeah, yeah.</i>

1625
01:56:29,715 --> 01:56:32,241
I need to talk to your supervisor right away.

1626
01:56:32,318 --> 01:56:34,444
<i>- Speaking.
- OK, listen to me.</i>

1627
01:56:34,520 --> 01:56:37,684
Something terrible
is about to happen to your building.

1628
01:56:37,791 --> 01:56:39,850
<i>It's under control, sir.</i>

1629
01:56:40,293 --> 01:56:43,854
<i>- Excuse me?
- Don't worry about us, sir. We're solid.</i>

1630
01:56:48,101 --> 01:56:49,466
<i>2160.</i>

1631
01:56:57,077 --> 01:56:59,603
Marla! Marla! Hey, wait!

1632
01:57:01,282 --> 01:57:04,080
Wait! I gotta talk to you! Marla! Marla!

1633
01:57:04,151 --> 01:57:08,315
Your bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom!
They almost broke my arm!

1634
01:57:08,456 --> 01:57:11,152
They were burning their fingertips with lye.

1635
01:57:11,258 --> 01:57:15,218
This needs a tremendous act of faith
on your part, but hear me out.

1636
01:57:15,297 --> 01:57:19,255
- Here comes an avalanche of bullshit.
- A little more faith than that.

1637
01:57:22,504 --> 01:57:25,064
I don't wanna hear
anything you have to say.

1638
01:57:25,140 --> 01:57:27,267
You have every right to be...

1639
01:57:27,876 --> 01:57:29,741
I'll just have a coffee, thanks.

1640
01:57:29,845 --> 01:57:32,780
Sir. Anything you order is free of charge, sir.

1641
01:57:32,881 --> 01:57:34,906
Why is it free of charge?

1642
01:57:34,983 --> 01:57:37,043
- Don't ask.
- Whatever.

1643
01:57:37,120 --> 01:57:42,648
I'll have the clam chowder, fried chicken
and baked potato and a chocolate chiffon pie.

1644
01:57:42,724 --> 01:57:44,784
Clean food, please.

1645
01:57:44,894 --> 01:57:47,920
In that case,
may I advise against the clam chowder.

1646
01:57:47,997 --> 01:57:50,090
No clam chowder. Thank you.

1647
01:57:51,567 --> 01:57:53,797
You got about 30 seconds.

1648
01:57:56,506 --> 01:57:58,998
I know I've been acting very strange, OK?

1649
01:57:59,109 --> 01:58:02,544
- I know it seems there's two sides to me...
- Two sides?

1650
01:58:02,612 --> 01:58:07,676
- You're Dr Jekyll and Mr Jackass.
- I know. But I realized something important.

1651
01:58:07,751 --> 01:58:11,812
- What?
- The nature of our relationship wasn't clear

1652
01:58:11,922 --> 01:58:14,288
to me for reasons I won't go into.

1653
01:58:14,358 --> 01:58:16,952
- I know I haven't treated you well.
- Whatever.

1654
01:58:17,027 --> 01:58:19,757
No, no. Fifteen seconds, please!

1655
01:58:19,830 --> 01:58:22,129
Fifteen seconds,
don't open your mouth.

1656
01:58:22,200 --> 01:58:24,292
I'm trying to tell you I'm sorry.

1657
01:58:24,368 --> 01:58:28,703
What I've come to realize
is that I really like you, Marla.

1658
01:58:28,773 --> 01:58:30,900
You do?

1659
01:58:30,975 --> 01:58:32,840
I really do.

1660
01:58:32,944 --> 01:58:37,244
I care about you and I don't want anything
bad to happen to you because of me.

1661
01:58:37,348 --> 01:58:40,112
Marla, your life is in danger.

1662
01:58:40,185 --> 01:58:42,119
What?

1663
01:58:42,187 --> 01:58:45,918
You need to leave town for a while.
Get out of any major city.

1664
01:58:45,990 --> 01:58:48,788
- Just go camping...
- You're an insane person.

1665
01:58:48,860 --> 01:58:52,319
- No. I've involved you in something terrible.
- No. Shut up!

1666
01:58:52,398 --> 01:58:54,958
- You're not safe.
- Shut up!

1667
01:58:56,769 --> 01:59:01,206
- Listen, I tried, Tyler. I really tried.
- I know you did.

1668
01:59:01,273 --> 01:59:04,334
There are things about you I like.
You're smart, funny.

1669
01:59:04,411 --> 01:59:06,379
You're spectacular in bed.

1670
01:59:06,446 --> 01:59:07,878
But

1671
01:59:07,980 --> 01:59:10,039
you're intolerable.

1672
01:59:10,149 --> 01:59:12,641
You have very serious emotional problems.

1673
01:59:12,752 --> 01:59:16,688
Deep-seated problems
for which you should seek professional help.

1674
01:59:16,790 --> 01:59:20,749
- I know, and I'm sorry.
- You're sorry, I'm sorry. Everyone's sorry.

1675
01:59:21,895 --> 01:59:23,988
I can't do this any more.

1676
01:59:24,064 --> 01:59:26,157
I can't.

1677
01:59:26,233 --> 01:59:28,293
And I won't.

1678
01:59:28,402 --> 01:59:30,426
I'm gone.

1679
01:59:30,503 --> 01:59:33,199
You can't leave, Marla! You're not safe!

1680
01:59:36,043 --> 01:59:38,705
- Marla, you don't understand!
- Leave me alone!

1681
01:59:38,813 --> 01:59:41,304
- Marla, I am trying to protect you!
- Let go!

1682
01:59:41,415 --> 01:59:44,407
- I don't ever wanna see you again!
- That's fine...

1683
01:59:44,485 --> 01:59:46,612
Here, wait right here!

1684
01:59:50,492 --> 01:59:53,051
Hold it right there! Shut up!

1685
01:59:53,127 --> 01:59:55,254
Take this money and get on this bus.

1686
01:59:55,329 --> 01:59:57,491
I promise I won't bother you again.

1687
01:59:57,633 --> 01:59:59,066
Shut up!

1688
01:59:59,134 --> 02:00:02,331
Please get on the bus. Please get on the bus.

1689
02:00:03,505 --> 02:00:05,632
Why are you doing this?

1690
02:00:05,707 --> 02:00:09,803
They think you're a threat.
I can't explain it now, just trust me!

1691
02:00:09,878 --> 02:00:14,247
- If I know where you are, you won't be safe.
- I'll keep this, it's asshole tax.

1692
02:00:14,316 --> 02:00:18,720
- Fine. Remember, stay out of major cities.
- Tyler.

1693
02:00:20,256 --> 02:00:23,089
You're the worst thing
that ever happened to me.

1694
02:00:38,107 --> 02:00:40,770
Hello. I need you to arrest me.

1695
02:00:40,878 --> 02:00:43,642
I am the leader of a terrorist organization

1696
02:00:43,714 --> 02:00:48,674
responsible for numerous acts
of vandalism and assault all over this city.

1697
02:00:48,752 --> 02:00:52,654
In the metropolitan area,
we had probably 200 members.

1698
02:00:52,723 --> 02:00:56,524
Chapters have sprung up
in five or six other major cities already.

1699
02:00:56,695 --> 02:00:59,720
This is a tightly-regimented organization

1700
02:00:59,797 --> 02:01:05,395
with many cells capable of operating
independent of central leadership.

1701
02:01:05,503 --> 02:01:09,371
Go to the house, OK? 1537 Paper Street.

1702
02:01:09,474 --> 02:01:11,374
That's our headquarters.

1703
02:01:11,476 --> 02:01:14,070
In the back, buried in the garden,

1704
02:01:14,145 --> 02:01:17,172
you'll find the body of Robert Paulsen.

1705
02:01:17,283 --> 02:01:20,581
In the basement,
you're gonna find some bathtubs

1706
02:01:20,719 --> 02:01:26,022
that have been used very recently
to make large quantities of nitroglycerin.

1707
02:01:26,125 --> 02:01:28,150
I believe the plan is to blow up

1708
02:01:28,227 --> 02:01:31,321
the headquarters
of these credit card companies

1709
02:01:31,397 --> 02:01:33,490
and the TRW building.

1710
02:01:34,433 --> 02:01:37,800
Why these buildings?
Why credit card companies?

1711
02:01:37,903 --> 02:01:41,498
If you erase the debt record,
then we all go back to zero.

1712
02:01:42,341 --> 02:01:44,400
You'll create total chaos.

1713
02:01:46,013 --> 02:01:49,244
Keep him talking. I need to make a phone
call.

1714
02:01:59,826 --> 02:02:02,057
I really admire what you're doing.

1715
02:02:02,530 --> 02:02:04,588
What?

1716
02:02:04,731 --> 02:02:06,756
You're a brave man to order this.

1717
02:02:06,833 --> 02:02:08,597
You're a genius, sir.

1718
02:02:08,736 --> 02:02:13,435
You said if anyone ever interferes
with Project Mayhem, even you,

1719
02:02:13,541 --> 02:02:15,873
we gotta get his balls.

1720
02:02:17,278 --> 02:02:20,441
- Don't fight.
- It's a powerful gesture, Mr Durden.

1721
02:02:20,548 --> 02:02:23,575
- It will set an example.
- You're making a big mistake!

1722
02:02:23,652 --> 02:02:26,484
- You said you'd say that.
- I'm not Tyler Durden!

1723
02:02:26,587 --> 02:02:30,456
- You told us you'd say that too.
- All right. I am Tyler Durden.

1724
02:02:30,559 --> 02:02:33,255
Listen to me. I'm giving you a direct order.

1725
02:02:33,362 --> 02:02:37,492
- We're aborting this mission now.
- You said you would definitely say that.

1726
02:02:43,639 --> 02:02:47,201
Are you fucking out of your minds?
You're police officers!

1727
02:02:48,043 --> 02:02:50,102
Is somebody timing this?

1728
02:02:50,279 --> 02:02:53,249
Keep your mouth shut.

1729
02:02:53,316 --> 02:02:55,409
Shit!

1730
02:02:58,054 --> 02:03:00,852
Some of this information checks out.

1731
02:03:00,924 --> 02:03:04,223
- Let's go to that house on Paper Street.
- Be right there.

1732
02:03:04,928 --> 02:03:06,692
Hey, wait!

1733
02:03:07,398 --> 02:03:09,922
- I got him.
- Sir, we have to do this.

1734
02:03:10,033 --> 02:03:12,501
- Stop fighting!
- Where's the rubber band?

1735
02:03:12,602 --> 02:03:15,094
Get away from me! Drop that fucking knife!

1736
02:03:18,642 --> 02:03:22,078
Back up. Face down on the floor right now!

1737
02:03:23,314 --> 02:03:25,339
Get down on the floor!

1738
02:03:30,122 --> 02:03:33,022
The first person
that comes out of this door

1739
02:03:33,090 --> 02:03:35,058
gets a lead salad! Understand?

1740
02:03:59,385 --> 02:04:01,979
Get away! Stay away!

1741
02:04:14,935 --> 02:04:16,993
<i>I ran.</i>

1742
02:04:17,537 --> 02:04:21,702
<i>I ran until my muscles burned
and my veins pumped battery acid.</i>

1743
02:04:24,344 --> 02:04:26,402
<i>Then I ran some more.</i>

1744
02:05:07,122 --> 02:05:09,420
What the fuck are you doing?

1745
02:05:09,525 --> 02:05:12,460
Running around in your underpants!
You look crazy!

1746
02:05:12,561 --> 02:05:15,655
No. I'm onto you.
I know what's going on here.

1747
02:05:15,764 --> 02:05:20,668
Come on, then. I got us a great place
to watch from. It'll be like pay-per-view.

1748
02:06:08,653 --> 02:06:11,316
- Oh, Christ.
- Now what are you doing?

1749
02:06:11,423 --> 02:06:14,790
- I'm stopping this.
- Why?

1750
02:06:14,860 --> 02:06:18,261
- The greatest thing you've ever done.
- I can't let this happen.

1751
02:06:18,330 --> 02:06:21,595
There are 10 other bombs
in 10 other buildings.

1752
02:06:21,667 --> 02:06:24,033
Since when is Project Mayhem
about murder?

1753
02:06:24,102 --> 02:06:26,094
The buildings are empty.

1754
02:06:26,205 --> 02:06:29,037
We're not killing anyone.
We're setting 'em free!

1755
02:06:29,107 --> 02:06:31,871
Bob is dead. They shot him in the head.

1756
02:06:32,010 --> 02:06:35,344
You wanna make an omelette,
you gotta break some eggs.

1757
02:06:35,448 --> 02:06:39,042
No. I'm not listening to you.
You're not even there.

1758
02:06:45,091 --> 02:06:49,460
I wouldn't do that.
Not unless you knew which wires were what.

1759
02:06:49,529 --> 02:06:51,258
If you know, I know.

1760
02:06:56,870 --> 02:07:01,238
<i>Or maybe I knew you'd know, so I spent
all day thinking about the wrong ones.</i>

1761
02:07:09,751 --> 02:07:10,842
You think?

1762
02:07:12,853 --> 02:07:14,946
Oh, heavens, no. Not the green one.

1763
02:07:15,789 --> 02:07:18,782
Pull any one but the green one.

1764
02:07:23,530 --> 02:07:26,159
I asked you not to do that!

1765
02:07:28,002 --> 02:07:29,560
Fuck!

1766
02:07:30,505 --> 02:07:32,598
Tyler, get away from the van.

1767
02:07:34,809 --> 02:07:38,210
Tyler, I'm not kidding!
Get away from the van!

1768
02:07:38,313 --> 02:07:39,679
Goddamn it!

1769
02:07:46,021 --> 02:07:47,386
OK.

1770
02:07:47,490 --> 02:07:50,823
You are now firing a gun
at your imaginary friend

1771
02:07:50,926 --> 02:07:53,521
near 400 gallons of nitroglycerin!

1772
02:07:55,731 --> 02:07:57,494
Cool it, Tyler!

1773
02:08:10,714 --> 02:08:12,773
Come on!

1774
02:08:12,849 --> 02:08:14,908
Don't go!

1775
02:08:52,491 --> 02:08:53,685
What?!

1776
02:09:39,173 --> 02:09:39,867
Three minutes.

1777
02:09:40,808 --> 02:09:43,106
This is it.

1778
02:09:43,210 --> 02:09:45,235
The beginning.

1779
02:09:45,312 --> 02:09:47,280
Ground zero.

1780
02:09:47,348 --> 02:09:49,646
<i>I think this is about where we came in.</i>

1781
02:09:49,717 --> 02:09:52,209
Do you have a speech for the occasion?

1782
02:09:52,287 --> 02:09:55,312
I'm sorry?

1783
02:09:55,422 --> 02:09:57,481
I still can't think of anything.

1784
02:09:59,528 --> 02:10:01,621
Flashback humor.

1785
02:10:06,701 --> 02:10:08,726
It's getting exciting now.

1786
02:10:10,305 --> 02:10:12,102
Two and a half.

1787
02:10:12,173 --> 02:10:14,734
Think of everything we've accomplished.

1788
02:10:14,844 --> 02:10:19,644
Out these windows, we will view
the collapse of financial history.

1789
02:10:19,714 --> 02:10:23,446
One step closer to economic equilibrium.

1790
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:39,399
Why is she here?

1791
02:10:39,502 --> 02:10:41,402
Tying up loose ends.

1792
02:10:41,504 --> 02:10:44,565
Put me down, you baldheaded fuck!

1793
02:10:44,675 --> 02:10:47,769
- I beg you, please don't do this.
- I'm not doing this.

1794
02:10:47,878 --> 02:10:51,336
<i>- We are doing this. This is what we want.
- No.</i>

1795
02:10:51,415 --> 02:10:56,148
- I don't want this.
- Right. Except you is meaningless now.

1796
02:10:56,219 --> 02:11:00,213
- We have to forget about you.
- You're a voice in my head.

1797
02:11:00,325 --> 02:11:02,383
You're a voice in mine!

1798
02:11:02,492 --> 02:11:05,326
- Why can't I get rid of you?
- You need me.

1799
02:11:05,396 --> 02:11:07,489
No. I don't. I really don't any more.

1800
02:11:07,565 --> 02:11:11,832
You created me. I didn't create some
loser alter ego to make me feel better.

1801
02:11:11,937 --> 02:11:15,895
- Take some responsibility.
- I do. I am responsible for all of it

1802
02:11:16,007 --> 02:11:17,736
and I accept that.

1803
02:11:17,809 --> 02:11:21,837
So, please, I'm begging you,
please call this off.

1804
02:11:23,848 --> 02:11:26,043
Have I ever let us down?

1805
02:11:27,519 --> 02:11:29,817
How far have you come because of me?!

1806
02:11:35,728 --> 02:11:37,787
I will bring us through this.

1807
02:11:37,863 --> 02:11:41,664
As always, I will carry you
kicking and screaming

1808
02:11:41,768 --> 02:11:44,202
and in the end you will thank me.

1809
02:11:44,671 --> 02:11:47,195
Tyler. Tyler.

1810
02:11:47,272 --> 02:11:50,800
I'm grateful to you.
For everything that you've done for me.

1811
02:11:50,877 --> 02:11:53,573
But this is too much. I don't want this.

1812
02:11:53,647 --> 02:11:58,949
What do you want? Your shitjob back?
Fucking condo world, watching sitcoms?

1813
02:11:59,019 --> 02:12:01,078
Fuck you! I won't do it.

1814
02:12:01,955 --> 02:12:05,790
- This can't be happening.
- It's already done, so shut up!

1815
02:12:05,860 --> 02:12:07,486
60 seconds till CRI.

1816
02:12:08,028 --> 02:12:10,087
No.

1817
02:12:11,999 --> 02:12:14,797
I can figure this out. This isn't even real.

1818
02:12:14,869 --> 02:12:18,566
You're not real, that gun...
That gun isn't even in your hand.

1819
02:12:20,041 --> 02:12:22,100
The gun's in my hand.

1820
02:12:27,115 --> 02:12:29,605
Good for you. It doesn't change a thing.

1821
02:12:38,493 --> 02:12:41,121
Why do you wanna put a gun to your head?

1822
02:12:41,263 --> 02:12:43,322
Not my head, Tyler.

1823
02:12:43,899 --> 02:12:45,924
Our head.

1824
02:12:47,470 --> 02:12:49,529
Interesting.

1825
02:12:52,541 --> 02:12:55,204
Where are you going with this, Ikea boy?

1826
02:13:01,683 --> 02:13:04,676
Hey. It's you and me.

1827
02:13:07,423 --> 02:13:09,483
Friends?

1828
02:13:10,327 --> 02:13:12,420
Tyler,

1829
02:13:15,832 --> 02:13:18,165
I want you to really listen to me.

1830
02:13:18,302 --> 02:13:20,736
OK.

1831
02:13:20,838 --> 02:13:22,897
My eyes are open.

1832
02:13:41,659 --> 02:13:43,684
What's that smell?

1833
02:14:03,315 --> 02:14:06,307
- Where is everybody?
- Oh, no. What's going on?

1834
02:14:06,952 --> 02:14:08,544
Mr Durden!

1835
02:14:09,622 --> 02:14:11,487
Oh, my God!

1836
02:14:16,830 --> 02:14:20,026
Are you... Are you all right, sir?

1837
02:14:20,132 --> 02:14:24,092
- Oh, yeah, I'm OK.
- You look terrible, sir. What happened?

1838
02:14:24,171 --> 02:14:28,164
- Nothing, it's no problem.
- No, no, no, sir. He's not kidding.

1839
02:14:28,241 --> 02:14:31,005
- You look awful. You need assistance.
- I'm fine.

1840
02:14:31,144 --> 02:14:34,739
Look, I'm fine... Everything's fine.

1841
02:14:37,017 --> 02:14:39,248
Stop it!

1842
02:14:39,387 --> 02:14:42,514
- Let her go.
- Christ Almighty!

1843
02:14:42,589 --> 02:14:44,386
You!

1844
02:14:44,457 --> 02:14:46,551
Hi, Marla.

1845
02:14:47,028 --> 02:14:51,862
- Leave her with me. Meet me downstairs.
- Are you sure?

1846
02:14:51,966 --> 02:14:54,025
Yes, I'm sure.

1847
02:14:55,136 --> 02:14:59,232
You fucker! What kind of sick
fucking game are you playing at?!

1848
02:14:59,374 --> 02:15:02,036
Putting me on a... Oh, my God, your face!

1849
02:15:02,144 --> 02:15:03,633
Yeah, I know.

1850
02:15:08,417 --> 02:15:10,282
What happened?

1851
02:15:10,419 --> 02:15:12,546
- Don't ask.
- You're shot.

1852
02:15:12,621 --> 02:15:14,680
- Yes, I'm shot.
- Oh, my God.

1853
02:15:15,624 --> 02:15:18,650
- I can't believe he's standing.
- One tough motherfucker.

1854
02:15:22,465 --> 02:15:24,296
Who did this?

1855
02:15:24,433 --> 02:15:26,901
I did, actually.

1856
02:15:27,002 --> 02:15:29,062
Find some gauze.

1857
02:15:30,440 --> 02:15:32,465
You shot yourself?

1858
02:15:32,575 --> 02:15:35,203
Yes, but it's OK. Marla, look at me.

1859
02:15:35,278 --> 02:15:37,576
I'm really OK.

1860
02:15:37,647 --> 02:15:41,606
Trust me. Everything's gonna be fine.

1861
02:15:54,431 --> 02:15:58,299
You met me at a very strange time in my life.
