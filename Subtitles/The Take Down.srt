2
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,343
- Pull up around this corner.

3
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:21,980
That's far enough, stop here.

4
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,193
- Code is 8185.

5
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,590
- Good evening Jack.

6
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,003
Your target tonight is Santos.

7
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:40,783
Aaron has confirmed that
he is inside and alone.

8
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,070
- Dad, when are we going home?

9
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,920
- As soon as I've uploaded this file.

10
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,110
- This is a
contract with MI operation

11
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,093
cleared by Hawkins.

12
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,118
- I'll meet you on level seven.

13
00:02:15,118 --> 00:02:15,951
- Okay.

14
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,380
- I can't have any loose ends,

15
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:24,237
so Aaron and the driver
also need to be taken out.

16
00:02:30,135 --> 00:02:31,214
- No, no!

17
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:36,666
Lucas, Lucas!

18
00:02:39,023 --> 00:02:40,644
No, no, no!

19
00:02:45,843 --> 00:02:48,000
- You're the
best in the firm Jack,

20
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,050
so don't let me down.

21
00:03:06,912 --> 00:03:08,330
- These two are supposed to be home,

22
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:10,005
not in the office.

23
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,742
It was you, you pulled
the trigger, not me.

24
00:03:23,742 --> 00:03:27,728
- Intruders on level seven.

25
00:03:48,711 --> 00:03:50,113
- Pull up around this corner.

26
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,323
That's far enough, stop here.

27
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:50,823
- Hey Mr. Jack.

28
00:04:51,832 --> 00:04:55,383
- Hi Camila.

29
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,980
- Do you want
me to finish the dishes

30
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,150
and then get going?

31
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,370
- Yeah, that'll be great.

32
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:10,203
No rush.

33
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:21,883
Hey Monkey, you had a good day?

34
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,410
What have you been up to?

35
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:30,920
- Amber did that in
the garden this afternoon.

36
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:33,250
- So you played outside?

37
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:38,173
- Well, I'm all done.

38
00:05:46,253 --> 00:05:47,970
- Can you keep your phone on?

39
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:50,550
I might need you to come
back in a few hours.

40
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,660
If work calls me.

41
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:52,620
- No problem.

42
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,920
You know where to find me.

43
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,693
- That's Victoria Gardens.

44
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:15,410
Your mother was so happy that day.

45
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:20,283
I miss her too Monkey, I miss her too.

46
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,873
Hello Eastwood.

47
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:41,173
- Not great news Jack.

48
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,930
- It was Aaron's job to
make sure Santos was alone.

49
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:48,080
- You were the one that
pulled the trigger.

50
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:52,230
- It shouldn't be pinned on me Eastwood.

51
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,873
- You broke the first fucking rule Jack.

52
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,550
- No mistakes, I know, but

53
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:05,230
if Aaron had done his job
we wouldn't be in this mess.

54
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,830
- Don't worry about him.

55
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,080
I've taken care of Aaron.

56
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:11,780
He told me his side of the story.

57
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,453
I'm sure we can smooth this out.

58
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,720
You're one of my top assassins,

59
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,987
but I need to hear full report from you.

60
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:26,250
- Where shall we meet?

61
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:29,703
- Uber House.

62
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:33,603
- I'll be there.

63
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,823
I'm sorry Amber, but it's getting late.

64
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:03,933
Time's up.

65
00:08:20,034 --> 00:08:21,367
You comfortable?

66
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:23,969
You need anything?

67
00:08:24,874 --> 00:08:25,707
Okay.

68
00:09:41,841 --> 00:09:43,123
- Hello.

69
00:09:43,123 --> 00:09:44,623
- Sorry it's late.

70
00:09:45,477 --> 00:09:47,880
Are you able to come over in an hour

71
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,933
to look after Amber?

72
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:53,173
I've got to go away for a few days.

73
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:56,570
- That's fine.

74
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:57,433
Everything okay?

75
00:10:01,191 --> 00:10:02,298
- It will be.

76
00:10:02,298 --> 00:10:03,465
Thanks Camila.

77
00:10:04,643 --> 00:10:06,091
- Any time.

78
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:19,920
You're gonna be late for the party.

79
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,230
- I'll be fine.

80
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,063
Everything is set up for you

81
00:12:22,063 --> 00:12:23,510
and the money's in the drawer.

82
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,040
- Mr. Jack.

83
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:26,873
- Yes.

84
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,543
- Don't worry.

85
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,240
- Amber looks up to you.

86
00:12:33,856 --> 00:12:35,023
You know that.

87
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,673
- The tarp is for you.

88
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,390
- Sorry to hear what happened Jack.

89
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,433
Sounds like it could have
happened to any of us.

90
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,783
I'm sure you know why you're really here.

91
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:58,343
Eastwood didn't feel like talking,

92
00:14:58,343 --> 00:15:00,093
but you always knew it would come to this.

93
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,670
I've always wondered
what it would be like,

94
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:08,803
taking a child's life.

95
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,463
Tell me, do you feel any remorse?

96
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,090
- You wouldn't understand.

97
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,820
- Is it that he will
never be able to grow up,

98
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,420
or just that he was so helpless?

99
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,260
- Get on with it Harris.

100
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:33,540
- Jack, Jack, Jack, I'm enjoying this.

101
00:15:35,923 --> 00:15:38,563
This kill is going to
be something to cherish.

102
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,093
- Just remember,

103
00:15:44,284 --> 00:15:45,884
you'll be standing here one day.

104
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:53,660
- You're forgetting, in this game,

105
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,213
there is always a price.

106
00:15:57,386 --> 00:15:59,072
And I'm ready to collect.

107
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:14,100
- Hello Jack.

108
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,450
- What the hell is going on Hawkins?

109
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:18,550
- I have to be frank, so listen carefully.

110
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:23,870
- You have my attention.

111
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,680
- We have been told that Eastwood

112
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,720
has been selling off UK government intel.

113
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,143
We can't have Eastwood
causing anymore damage.

114
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,293
- So,

115
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,560
you want me to kill him?

116
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,050
- You're the best in the firm Jack.

117
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:42,750
Plus, we can take care of
Amber until the job is done.

118
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:46,573
You and Amber will be free.

119
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:51,023
It's time you trust me Jack.

120
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,790
I'm sending a car now to pick up Amber.

121
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:04,059
Do we have a deal?

122
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,031
- Yes.

123
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:19,209
- You have 12
hours to take down Eastwood.

124
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:21,890
- I'll do my best.

125
00:17:48,223 --> 00:17:49,140
- Hello.

126
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,360
- Camila, this is Jack.

127
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,690
No time to explain.

128
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:54,610
Wake Amber up, pack her bag,

129
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:56,660
and be ready to leave as soon as you can.

130
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,750
And whatever you do, don't make any calls

131
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,723
or answer the door.

132
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:04,730
Do you understand?

133
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:06,110
- Sure.

134
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:08,973
- Camila, get out
of bed and do it now.

135
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:20,043
- Wake up Monkey.

136
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,578
Daddy's coming, but we need to get up now.

137
00:18:23,578 --> 00:18:24,777
It's important.

138
00:18:24,777 --> 00:18:29,777
Hurry.

139
00:18:47,825 --> 00:18:50,320
- Hey Monkey, you have to go
and stay with some people.

140
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,240
Take Amber.

141
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,560
You have your things?

142
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,680
- Yeah.

143
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,714
- I know, I'm sorry honey.

144
00:18:55,714 --> 00:18:57,175
- Her things are there.

145
00:18:57,175 --> 00:18:58,533
What the hell is going on?

146
00:18:58,533 --> 00:19:00,670
- You and Amber are going to
go and stay in a safe place.

147
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:02,444
They'll be here in a minute.

148
00:19:02,444 --> 00:19:04,160
- Who's they?

149
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,550
- The government.

150
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:06,383
- What?

151
00:19:09,164 --> 00:19:09,997
- Camila.

152
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:16,573
Grab the bags.

153
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,130
- Let's go, we need to move.

154
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:29,963
This is for you.

155
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,110
- Agents Gabriel and Tennin are

156
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,697
assigned to security for Amber.

157
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:38,270
- Sir, Amber and Camila,
they're in safe hands.

158
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:39,320
- They had better be.

159
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,470
They're loaded and ready to go.

160
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:43,760
- Good luck Jack.

161
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,927
- We gotta go.

162
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:38,070
- You took your time.

163
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:38,903
- You know me.

164
00:20:38,903 --> 00:20:40,650
I don't like to rush.

165
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:43,320
- Unless you're trying
to cover your tracks.

166
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,510
- It's just business Jack.

167
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,010
- But to do that to me?

168
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:50,700
- Come on Jack, you should know this game

169
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,793
better than anyone.

170
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,993
- I thought we were living by a code?

171
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:58,063
- Some codes have to be broken.

172
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:03,360
- I see you've sent me a message.

173
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,193
- What's that?

174
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,250
- You're scared.

175
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:09,580
- How do you come to that conclusion?

176
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,463
- Because you sent Katarina.

177
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:16,200
- You can't beat me Jack.

178
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,030
- How many assassins are you going to send

179
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,513
to stop me coming after you?

180
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:24,283
- As many as it takes.

181
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:04,923
- Carter, it's Jack.

182
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,600
I need your help.

183
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,543
No time to talk.

184
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,644
Meet me at Rainbow Gardens in 30 minutes.

185
00:22:11,644 --> 00:22:14,100
- I'll be there.

186
00:23:17,523 --> 00:23:19,094
- Can I help you with anything?

187
00:23:19,094 --> 00:23:20,094
- Not today.

188
00:25:30,544 --> 00:25:32,855
- I thought you were a good shot Jack.

189
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,940
Come on Jack, I thought
you were better than that.

190
00:26:57,943 --> 00:27:00,723
Eastwood's not going to
stop sending us Jack.

191
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,120
- Good timing, they're just
coming into the office now.

192
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,620
- I'd like to speak to Camila.

193
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:53,953
- Camila.

194
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:55,870
Jack on the phone.

195
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:02,230
- Mr. Jack.

196
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:03,490
- Is Amber okay?

197
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:05,090
- Yes, she's with me.

198
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:07,890
- Promise me never to
let her out of your sight.

199
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:08,793
- Okay, I will.

200
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:15,210
- Hawkins.

201
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:16,950
- They're here and they're safe

202
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:18,010
and they'll stay that way.

203
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:19,053
You have my word.

204
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:22,100
- Let me speak to Amber.

205
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,100
- I'll take you through.

206
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:30,320
Amber, your father would
like to speak to you.

207
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,940
- Are you okay?

208
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:39,313
Okay Monkey, is Camila close by?

209
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:46,040
I want you to stay with her at all times.

210
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,190
Can you do that for me?

211
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,950
I know it's strange, and
there's a lot going on,

212
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:56,210
but everything's going to be okay.

213
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:57,043
You're safe.

214
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,740
- Can't she speak?

215
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,640
- She hasn't said a word

216
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,473
since her mother passed away.

217
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:19,443
- I have Gabriel and Tennin on her 24/7.

218
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,420
Get me Eastwood Jack.

219
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:24,020
- I've already started.

220
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,350
- Good.

221
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:28,080
- How much intel
does Eastwood know?

222
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,100
- Enough.

223
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:32,220
It's who he's selling it
to that's of concern to us.

224
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:34,160
- Eastwood knows
I'm working for you.

225
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,720
- I never said it would be easy.

226
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,230
Keep moving.

227
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:38,673
- I'll keep you posted.

228
00:30:03,006 --> 00:30:03,839
Carter.

229
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,293
- It's been a while since we met here.

230
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,023
- It's still secure.

231
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:19,217
- It's good to see you.

232
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:20,883
I know it's not a social visit.

233
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:26,883
- I need a favor.

234
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,120
- What have you done?

235
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:38,483
- I need locations of
all of Eastwood's agents.

236
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:44,223
- So it is true?

237
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:47,613
- Hawkins.

238
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,533
She's my only way out.

239
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:54,390
- You haven't changed.

240
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:58,780
Any idea where Eastwood is?

241
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,410
- I'm going to see someone who might.

242
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,460
- Watch your back.

243
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:11,540
I'll do what I can.

244
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:13,660
- Thank you Carter.

245
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:21,063
- Hey.

246
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:27,813
Take care.

247
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:15,300
- Which added services you require?

248
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:17,570
- You know which kind?

249
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:20,613
- Jack?

250
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,293
Where and when?

251
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,903
- If you want me, meet me in
10 minutes at the rooftop.

252
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,460
You always are the best.

253
00:33:09,877 --> 00:33:11,920
- Sorry for the inconvenience.

254
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,515
We have special guests in this week.

255
00:33:14,515 --> 00:33:15,604
- No problem.

256
00:33:15,604 --> 00:33:17,354
Better to be safe than sorry right?

257
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:37,920
- Have a good day.

258
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,753
- Thank you.

259
00:33:56,297 --> 00:33:58,614
- Sorry for the inconvenience sir.

260
00:33:58,614 --> 00:34:00,164
We're gonna have to search you.

261
00:34:07,308 --> 00:34:08,641
Have a good day.

262
00:35:13,457 --> 00:35:15,124
- Where is Eastwood?

263
00:35:25,886 --> 00:35:26,719
Okay.

264
00:36:42,341 --> 00:36:43,841
Just tell me where he is Chan.

265
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:50,960
When did you get the call?

266
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:54,620
- It doesn't matter.

267
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,943
- Jack,
listen, I'm working on it.

268
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,603
- I need them ASAP.

269
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:44,240
- Locating assassins
is not as easy as you think.

270
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,760
Two seconds, I'll call you back.

271
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:11,430
- Eyes up.

272
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:12,923
We know the target's inside.

273
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:15,490
Lee cover the corner.

274
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:16,580
- Copy.

275
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:18,283
- Michaels, take the side entrance.

276
00:38:18,283 --> 00:38:19,610
- Copy.

277
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:21,480
- Are you there?

278
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,080
The location should be with you.

279
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,133
- Nothing.

280
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:28,563
- Okay, try now.

281
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:30,483
- Got it.

282
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:33,150
Okay, I'll call you back.

283
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:34,750
- Wait, wait, I'm
still missing two agents.

284
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:35,810
- I've got eyes on him!

285
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:36,643
- Go, go, go!

286
00:38:37,637 --> 00:38:38,470
- Gotta go.

287
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:46,553
- He's heading south.

288
00:38:48,845 --> 00:38:52,345
- Follow him around the corner.

289
00:38:54,103 --> 00:38:55,153
- I have eyes on him.

290
00:39:07,205 --> 00:39:08,372
I've lost him.

291
00:39:14,962 --> 00:39:15,795
Let's split up.

292
00:39:15,795 --> 00:39:16,930
Lee, go high side along.

293
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:17,763
- Copy.

294
00:39:17,763 --> 00:39:19,198
- Push up two streets and loop back.

295
00:39:19,198 --> 00:39:20,596
- Copy.

296
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:39,720
- I'm on Bar Street.

297
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:42,040
Michaels, meet me on Chespire Avenue.

298
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:42,873
- Copy.

299
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:46,143
I'm 30 seconds away.

300
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:50,286
- Lee, follow my border street.

301
00:39:50,286 --> 00:39:51,703
- Copy, en route.

302
00:39:58,013 --> 00:40:01,095
- We've got him surrounded.

303
00:40:01,095 --> 00:40:02,178
I've got him.

304
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:14,840
- 60 pounds please.

305
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,210
- Lee, go around the back.

306
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:17,043
- Have fun.

307
00:40:19,635 --> 00:40:21,230
- This way please.

308
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:22,510
This your first time?

309
00:40:26,152 --> 00:40:28,177
I hope you have a good time here.

310
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,383
Do enjoy yourself.

311
00:41:15,432 --> 00:41:16,265
This way.

312
00:41:28,709 --> 00:41:29,959
- How would you like this?

313
00:41:29,959 --> 00:41:31,658
Fast or slow?

314
00:41:31,658 --> 00:41:33,741
- Slow, very slow.

315
00:42:33,933 --> 00:42:35,313
- Your time is up.

316
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,443
- Shit!

317
00:44:47,293 --> 00:44:48,126
- Hawkins.

318
00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:52,020
- I know about the shooting in the club.

319
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:54,903
The civilian head count you
left behind is concerning.

320
00:44:56,090 --> 00:44:57,730
- I need to check in with Amber.

321
00:44:57,730 --> 00:44:59,519
- Now is not the time.

322
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:01,480
- Make time.

323
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:02,433
- Okay Jack.

324
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:04,960
Anything on Eastwood.

325
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,950
- No, he's sending every asset

326
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:08,923
to try and stop me reaching him.

327
00:45:10,970 --> 00:45:12,140
- Is that Jack?

328
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:13,620
- Yes.

329
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:15,440
- When are we getting out of here?

330
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:16,523
- Hopefully soon.

331
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:18,670
It's your father.

332
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:24,263
- Hey honey.

333
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:26,413
You okay?

334
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:34,380
I promise, you and Camila
will be out of there soon.

335
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:35,213
Alright?

336
00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:40,870
Just hang in there for the time being.

337
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:43,673
I love you Monkey.

338
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:45,593
- Thanks.

339
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:48,733
To be honest, I expected more by now.

340
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:52,930
- Why was Santos working for you?

341
00:45:52,930 --> 00:45:54,610
- We had our suspicions about Eastwood

342
00:45:54,610 --> 00:45:56,010
and needed to be sure.

343
00:45:56,010 --> 00:45:59,670
Santos found what we wanted
but you killed him before--

344
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:00,503
- Go on.

345
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:03,393
- It's classified Jack.

346
00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:07,480
This conversation is for another time.

347
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:09,720
- So I'm just another pawn.

348
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:12,400
- For now, just do what needs to be done

349
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,583
and then Amber gets her father back.

350
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:18,553
Find Eastwood Jack.

351
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:28,810
- They're asking for an update.

352
00:46:28,810 --> 00:46:30,542
- I'm working on it.

353
00:46:30,542 --> 00:46:32,459
- Yes ma'am.

354
00:47:50,490 --> 00:47:52,570
- You're causing quite
a wake behind you brother.

355
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:53,670
- Carter I'm bleeding.

356
00:47:56,270 --> 00:47:57,623
And Bronson's on my tail.

357
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:00,870
I need a blocker.

358
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:04,010
I'll be coming out of 400 Street Station.

359
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:06,110
- I'll be there.

360
00:49:23,476 --> 00:49:27,393
- The next
station is Warren Street.

361
00:49:52,589 --> 00:49:53,887
- What the!

362
00:49:53,887 --> 00:49:54,720
- Shit, I'm sorry.

363
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:57,553
I'm sorry, I didn't see you there.

364
00:50:15,714 --> 00:50:16,950
- You're in the clear.

365
00:50:16,950 --> 00:50:18,760
You can use your safe
house on Craven Street.

366
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:19,593
- Thank you.

367
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,440
Any luck locating Eastwood?

368
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:23,390
- Not yet.

369
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:26,643
Get yourself off the
streets and call me back.

370
00:51:13,747 --> 00:51:15,800
- You holding up?

371
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:16,633
- Just about.

372
00:51:18,730 --> 00:51:20,283
I need one last favor.

373
00:51:21,555 --> 00:51:22,388
- It'll have to be.

374
00:51:22,388 --> 00:51:24,520
I got people crawling all
over me at the office.

375
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:30,303
- Double check what flight Barnes is on.

376
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:34,400
- Checking now, checking now.

377
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:35,610
What's on your mind?

378
00:51:35,610 --> 00:51:38,290
- Something is not quite right.

379
00:51:38,290 --> 00:51:39,340
- And Amber?

380
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:41,880
- She's okay.

381
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:42,960
- You said that, but what if,

382
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,360
and I'm just saying what if.

383
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:47,963
- She's with Hawkins.

384
00:51:50,610 --> 00:51:51,820
- You're not gonna believe this.

385
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:53,470
Barnes got on the earlier flight.

386
00:51:57,060 --> 00:51:59,540
- Barnes is helping
Eastwood sell all the intel.

387
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:01,030
- Sure?

388
00:52:01,030 --> 00:52:01,863
- Yeah.

389
00:52:02,797 --> 00:52:04,547
- Good luck.

390
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:03,687
- I'm in here.

391
00:53:16,430 --> 00:53:17,433
No one else is here.

392
00:53:26,701 --> 00:53:30,118
If you're looking for Eastwood he's gone.

393
00:53:33,430 --> 00:53:34,263
- Where?

394
00:53:36,770 --> 00:53:37,920
- I don't care anymore.

395
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:43,590
- What do you mean?

396
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:49,183
- It's finished.

397
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:52,633
I'm done.

398
00:53:56,044 --> 00:53:59,127
- You're not making any sense.

399
00:54:00,154 --> 00:54:01,433
- That's my point.

400
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:07,723
None of this makes any sense.

401
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:12,623
Why do we even do this?

402
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:26,510
- That's a good question.

403
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,310
- Amber's not safe anymore.

404
00:54:37,210 --> 00:54:38,043
- What?

405
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:43,200
- You're the only one capable
of taking down Eastwood.

406
00:54:49,010 --> 00:54:50,910
- Just tell me what's going on.

407
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:53,273
I know Amber's safe.

408
00:54:55,510 --> 00:54:57,770
- Everything
you need is in here.

409
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:41,263
- Come on, come on.

410
00:56:44,528 --> 00:56:45,945
Pick up, pick up.

411
00:56:47,003 --> 00:56:49,061
- You really need to make sure.

412
00:56:49,061 --> 00:56:50,504
Can you give me two minutes?

413
00:56:50,504 --> 00:56:51,921
- Yes.

414
00:57:09,049 --> 00:57:11,013
- Come with us, we need to
move to a different room.

415
00:57:19,308 --> 00:57:22,641
- Don't worry honey, it's gonna be fine.

416
00:57:28,930 --> 00:57:29,830
Where are you taking us?

417
00:57:29,830 --> 00:57:31,547
- Just to another room.

418
00:58:21,684 --> 00:58:23,851
- Where the hell are they?

419
00:58:27,825 --> 00:58:29,866
Where the hell are they!

420
00:58:29,866 --> 00:58:32,177
Make the call, lock down the building.

421
00:58:32,177 --> 00:58:33,930
Find me those girls!

422
00:58:33,930 --> 00:58:35,751
- I'm on it.

423
00:58:35,751 --> 00:58:37,751
- Lockdown the building.

424
00:58:54,793 --> 00:58:55,678
- Stop, stop!

425
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:11,870
- Tennin's down.

426
00:59:11,870 --> 00:59:13,010
Gabriel was seen fleeing the scene

427
00:59:13,010 --> 00:59:15,249
in an SUV with Amber in hand.

428
00:59:15,249 --> 00:59:16,877
- Get me eyes on that SUV.

429
00:59:16,877 --> 00:59:17,877
- Yes ma'am.

430
00:59:35,745 --> 00:59:37,200
- Get Amber and Camila out of there.

431
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:38,940
They're going to take Amber.

432
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:41,730
Gabriel and Tennin are
working for Eastwood.

433
00:59:41,730 --> 00:59:42,563
- Jack--

434
00:59:42,563 --> 00:59:43,657
- Do it now.

435
00:59:47,340 --> 00:59:50,080
- Jack, they're already gone.

436
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:51,140
I'm sorry.

437
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:51,973
Jack.

438
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:54,653
I'm sorry.

439
00:59:57,170 --> 00:59:58,223
I'm sorry Jack.

440
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:02,350
- You gave me your word.

441
01:00:04,540 --> 01:00:06,550
- We're doing our best to locate her.

442
01:00:09,689 --> 01:00:12,189
- You better pray that you do.

443
01:01:30,230 --> 01:01:32,990
- Hey buddy, where are you?

444
01:01:32,990 --> 01:01:33,823
We need to meet.

445
01:01:35,780 --> 01:01:37,003
- Did you get Barnes?

446
01:01:38,410 --> 01:01:39,243
- He's down.

447
01:01:40,490 --> 01:01:42,790
I have some information
I need you to look at.

448
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:44,753
- Okay.

449
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:46,613
Sure.

450
01:01:47,930 --> 01:01:49,207
Rainbow Gardens?

451
01:01:49,207 --> 01:01:51,157
- That's the wrong side of town for me.

452
01:01:52,410 --> 01:01:53,510
How about Jonah's Bar?

453
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:56,433
- Sure.

454
01:01:57,510 --> 01:01:58,653
I can be there in 15.

455
01:02:35,669 --> 01:02:36,502
- Don't.

456
01:02:44,533 --> 01:02:45,763
- This is how it is?

457
01:02:56,650 --> 01:02:57,663
- How could you?

458
01:03:02,972 --> 01:03:03,972
- I'm sorry.

459
01:03:14,910 --> 01:03:16,543
- Why did it have to be you?

460
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:26,020
- You've been lying for as long as I have.

461
01:03:27,890 --> 01:03:29,243
It's hard to really tell the truth.

462
01:03:33,890 --> 01:03:35,807
Eastwood paid of Gabriel and Tennin.

463
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:39,823
Same as he did with me.

464
01:03:53,290 --> 01:03:55,440
You've been a step
behind this entire time.

465
01:05:03,710 --> 01:05:06,210
- Where have they taken Amber?

466
01:05:09,087 --> 01:05:11,063
Just tell me where she is.

467
01:05:12,860 --> 01:05:14,323
Where have they taken her?

468
01:05:15,714 --> 01:05:16,714
- I'm sorry.

469
01:05:30,954 --> 01:05:32,287
- Please Carter.

470
01:05:45,529 --> 01:05:46,946
- I'm sorry Jack.

471
01:05:47,896 --> 01:05:48,979
I don't know.

472
01:05:56,849 --> 01:05:58,016
- You're done.

473
01:06:27,491 --> 01:06:30,223
- Why do you think Barnes
gave you his phone?

474
01:06:34,110 --> 01:06:36,393
- I've had enough of your games.

475
01:07:18,330 --> 01:07:21,120
- Is this all we have?

476
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:23,063
- If he comes, we'll know about it.

477
01:07:24,147 --> 01:07:25,921
This is the best we could
get at short notice.

478
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:31,613
It's Jack.

479
01:07:34,660 --> 01:07:35,560
- Just put him on.

480
01:07:40,891 --> 01:07:42,691
- Hawkins has played you for a fool.

481
01:07:44,090 --> 01:07:45,950
- I've seen Barnes phone.

482
01:07:45,950 --> 01:07:48,060
I know where you are Eastwood.

483
01:07:48,060 --> 01:07:49,920
And I have the file proving you sold

484
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:51,170
all the government intel.

485
01:07:54,220 --> 01:07:55,247
If this got out--

486
01:07:56,310 --> 01:07:57,310
- You have the file?

487
01:07:59,791 --> 01:08:01,091
- And I'm coming to trade.

488
01:08:12,863 --> 01:08:15,010
- What'd he say?

489
01:08:15,010 --> 01:08:17,083
- He's coming for the exchange.

490
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:19,393
Get momentum.

491
01:08:42,820 --> 01:08:43,653
- Sorry.

492
01:09:07,231 --> 01:09:08,064
- Jack's on his way.

493
01:09:08,064 --> 01:09:09,740
You three, cover the west side.

494
01:09:09,740 --> 01:09:11,630
North side, alright.

495
01:09:11,630 --> 01:09:12,463
Let's go.

496
01:09:48,397 --> 01:09:49,230
- Jack.

497
01:09:49,230 --> 01:09:50,460
- I'm going to get Amber.

498
01:09:50,460 --> 01:09:51,949
If you want Eastwood,

499
01:09:51,949 --> 01:09:53,773
you're going to have to come and get him.

500
01:09:54,940 --> 01:09:56,470
- I just want to say I'm sorry--

501
01:09:56,470 --> 01:09:58,430
- It's too late for that now.

502
01:09:58,430 --> 01:09:59,680
- Jack, wait...

503
01:10:38,650 --> 01:10:41,650
- Two one, this
is zero sit wrap, over.

504
01:10:41,650 --> 01:10:43,323
- Two one, nothing to report.

505
01:10:53,470 --> 01:10:55,700
- Section four,
east side, this is zero.

506

- East side clear.

507
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:58,100
- Copy, moving on.

508
01:11:14,605 --> 01:11:19,605
- Three, three.

509
01:11:23,028 --> 01:11:24,779
- Zero two, this is zero.

510
01:11:24,779 --> 01:11:26,426
Go up and find three two, over.

511
01:11:26,426 --> 01:11:29,122
- Copy, on the move.

512
01:11:38,408 --> 01:11:40,700
- One two,
what's the official patrol?

513
01:11:40,700 --> 01:11:41,823
To the south side.

514
01:11:41,823 --> 01:11:43,310
One one zero.

515
01:11:43,310 --> 01:11:44,143
- All clear.

516
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:47,893
- Pull back around
and remain in position one.

517
01:11:56,670 --> 01:11:57,990
Jack can't be far away.

518
01:11:57,990 --> 01:11:59,990
Remember, shoot on sight.

519
01:11:59,990 --> 01:12:02,123
I repeat, shoot on sight.

520
01:12:38,950 --> 01:12:40,193
All sections stay alert.

521
01:12:41,150 --> 01:12:43,282
Intel reports Jack's en route.

522
01:12:43,282 --> 01:12:46,063
Hold your positions and
await further instruction.

523
01:13:41,418 --> 01:13:42,910
- Charlie team, section three,

524
01:13:42,910 --> 01:13:44,671
do you see Jack?

525
01:13:44,671 --> 01:13:47,671
- Charlie team, section three clear.

526
01:13:58,216 --> 01:13:59,565
- Man down, man down!

527
01:13:59,565 --> 01:14:00,806
Zero, shots fired!

528
01:14:00,806 --> 01:14:01,639
Shots fired!

529
01:14:01,639 --> 01:14:02,560
- I can't see him.

530
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:03,486
Where is he?

531
01:14:08,324 --> 01:14:09,650
- Don't go out.

532
01:14:09,650 --> 01:14:10,750
What's your positions?

533
01:14:15,510 --> 01:14:16,533
- Where is he?

534
01:14:16,533 --> 01:14:17,366
- West side.

535
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:20,090
Check all the doors and lock it down.

536
01:14:20,090 --> 01:14:20,923
- Copy.

537
01:14:22,430 --> 01:14:23,390
- Come with me.

538
01:14:36,780 --> 01:14:38,860
- Everyone, hold your fire, take cover.

539
01:14:38,860 --> 01:14:39,760
- Copy.

540
01:14:56,780 --> 01:14:59,490
One three to zero, all
other sections are down.

541
01:14:59,490 --> 01:15:00,910
What are your orders?

542
01:15:00,910 --> 01:15:02,630
- Focus on the west side of the garden.

543
01:15:02,630 --> 01:15:04,050
80 feet from the house.

544
01:15:04,050 --> 01:15:04,883
Stay hidden.

545
01:15:04,883 --> 01:15:07,043
He has a long-range rifle.

546
01:15:07,043 --> 01:15:08,543
- Copy.

547
01:15:13,367 --> 01:15:14,583
- Let's get him on the phone.

548
01:15:19,070 --> 01:15:19,903
- Make the call.

549
01:15:22,404 --> 01:15:24,080
- Everyone, hold your fire.

550
01:15:37,307 --> 01:15:40,450
- Are you going to hand over the file?

551
01:15:40,450 --> 01:15:42,200
- Are you ready to hand over Amber?

552
01:15:43,370 --> 01:15:44,750
- Since you took out my men,

553
01:15:44,750 --> 01:15:46,380
it only seems fair that you come out

554
01:15:46,380 --> 01:15:47,530
and we do the exchange.

555
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:51,270
- So you're just going to let us leave

556
01:15:51,270 --> 01:15:52,433
once I give it to you?

557
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:57,723
- I'm sure we can negotiate Jack.

558
01:16:00,740 --> 01:16:02,140
- Tell your man to back off.

559
01:16:12,050 --> 01:16:13,360
- Nobody move.

560
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:14,210
Keep cover.

561
01:16:14,210 --> 01:16:15,360
Let's see what he does.

562
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:21,166
- Three one
to zero, shots fired!

563
01:16:21,166 --> 01:16:22,225
Shots fired!

564
01:16:25,075 --> 01:16:27,107
Copy, moving in.

565
01:16:27,107 --> 01:16:28,059
Two bodies down.

566
01:16:28,059 --> 01:16:33,059
Section two one out.

567
01:16:38,316 --> 01:16:39,515
- Keep calm.

568
01:16:39,515 --> 01:16:41,143
Route one, draw him out.

569
01:16:41,143 --> 01:16:43,201
Zero two, move left.

570
01:16:43,201 --> 01:16:44,520
- Copy, moving in.

571
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:45,552
- Two three move right.

572
01:16:45,552 --> 01:16:47,025
- Two three, on the move.

573
01:16:47,025 --> 01:16:48,526
- Two four, push forward.

574
01:16:48,526 --> 01:16:50,443
- Copy that.

575
01:16:56,436 --> 01:16:57,363
- Give me cover!

576
01:16:57,363 --> 01:16:58,759
Flank him right, flank him right!

577
01:16:58,759 --> 01:17:00,175
Follow me, follow me!

578
01:17:00,175 --> 01:17:02,099
Flank him left, flank him left!

579
01:17:02,099 --> 01:17:04,419
- I have one down,
section three, section three!

580
01:17:06,893 --> 01:17:09,793
- Man down, man
down, section two, section two.

581
01:17:15,810 --> 01:17:17,500
- Section
two, I'm moving forward.

582
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:18,960
We need more men, western perimeter.

583
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:20,200
- Hug the tree line.

584
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:22,410
Draw him away from the house.

585
01:17:22,410 --> 01:17:24,210
Take him out while he's in the open.

586
01:17:29,717 --> 01:17:33,717
- There are
only two of us left boss.

587
01:18:28,630 --> 01:18:29,463
- It's time.

588
01:18:32,860 --> 01:18:34,483
Bring me Amber.

589
01:18:34,483 --> 01:18:35,316
- Okay.

590
01:18:56,020 --> 01:18:57,353
- Go!

591
01:18:58,900 --> 01:18:59,733
- Amber run!

592
01:18:59,733 --> 01:19:00,566
Go!

593
01:19:05,010 --> 01:19:06,960
- Amber's gone, get me eyes on her now!

594
01:19:08,380 --> 01:19:10,461
Bring me that girl and don't
come back unless you do!

595
01:19:10,461 --> 01:19:11,961
- Okay, I'm on it.

596
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:30,658
- Those wounds must be slowing you down.

597
01:20:15,532 --> 01:20:17,865
- It's down here, down here.

598
01:20:37,474 --> 01:20:38,307
- What's that over there?

599
01:20:38,307 --> 01:20:39,430
- Stop, stop, it's Amber!

600
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:21,500
- I'm sorry you had to
hear that sound Jack.

601
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:23,450
I did ask him to bring her back.

602
01:21:23,450 --> 01:21:24,967
Guess I didn't specify how.

603
01:22:26,352 --> 01:22:27,863
Shit.

604
01:22:42,937 --> 01:22:45,883
- If you want me, you
know where to find me.

605
01:23:24,190 --> 01:23:25,023
- I'm here.

606
01:23:28,813 --> 01:23:30,143
Come on out Jack.

607
01:23:42,140 --> 01:23:43,883
I've got to hand it to you Jack.

608
01:23:48,130 --> 01:23:49,763
You're one stubborn bastard.

609
01:24:00,990 --> 01:24:01,943
Come on Jack.

610
01:24:04,430 --> 01:24:05,263
You need help?

611
01:24:07,350 --> 01:24:08,183
It looks bad.

612
01:24:15,530 --> 01:24:17,440
You're in pretty bad shape.

613
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:19,390
Why don't you just hand over the intel?

614
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:30,590
You've been a dead man
since you took out that kid.

615
01:24:38,228 --> 01:24:42,290
You really have played
straight into Hawkins hands.

616
01:24:50,140 --> 01:24:52,350
Not a smart move Jack.

617
01:24:52,350 --> 01:24:53,913
Not a smart move.

618
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:13,913
Give it to me.

619
01:25:20,593 --> 01:25:22,083
- YAnd you're finished.

620
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:01,353
- Daddy!

621
01:26:26,733 --> 01:26:28,900
- Don't be scared darling.

622
01:26:30,372 --> 01:26:32,955
Everything is going to be okay.

623
01:26:49,123 --> 01:26:50,923
- I can't have loose ends Jack.

624
01:26:52,666 --> 01:26:57,666
- No!

624
01:26:58,305 --> 01:27:58,827
