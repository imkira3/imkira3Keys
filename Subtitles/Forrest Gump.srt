00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,117
(BUS APPROACHING)

3
00:03:19,349 --> 00:03:20,599
Hello.

4
00:03:21,559 --> 00:03:24,228
My name's Forrest. Forrest Gump.

5
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:31,819
Do you want a chocolate?

6
00:03:34,405 --> 00:03:37,825
I could eat about
a million and a half of these.

7
00:03:38,993 --> 00:03:44,206
My mama always said
life was like a box of chocolates.

8
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:49,086
You never know what you're gonna get.

9
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:58,846
Those must be comfortable shoes.

10
00:04:00,223 --> 00:04:04,893
I'll bet you could walk all day
in shoes like that and not feel a thing.

11
00:04:07,105 --> 00:04:09,565
I wish I had shoes like that.

12
00:04:10,232 --> 00:04:11,774
My feet hurt.

13
00:04:12,985 --> 00:04:14,652
Mama always said there's an awful lot

14
00:04:14,736 --> 00:04:17,947
you could tell about a person
by their shoes:

15
00:04:19,074 --> 00:04:22,034
Where they're going,
where they've been.

16
00:04:29,293 --> 00:04:31,335
I've worn lots of shoes.

17
00:04:34,464 --> 00:04:39,260
I bet if I think about it real hard,
I could remember my first pair of shoes.

18
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:44,807
Mama said they'd take me anywhere.

19
00:04:45,601 --> 00:04:48,227
She said they was my magic shoes.

20
00:04:48,312 --> 00:04:51,480
All right, Forrest,
you can open your eyes now.

21
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,240
Let's take a little walk around.

22
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,832
How do those feel?

23
00:05:12,794 --> 00:05:14,962
His legs are strong, Mrs. Gump,

24
00:05:15,047 --> 00:05:17,548
as strong as I've ever seen,

25
00:05:17,633 --> 00:05:21,010
but his back is as crooked
as a politician.

26
00:05:22,304 --> 00:05:25,389
But we're gonna straighten him right up,
now, aren't we, Forrest?

27
00:05:25,474 --> 00:05:26,599
Forrest!

28
00:05:28,101 --> 00:05:29,310
FORREST: Now, when I was a baby,

29
00:05:29,394 --> 00:05:32,230
Mama named me after
the great Civil War hero,

30
00:05:32,314 --> 00:05:34,732
General Nathan Bedford Forrest.

31
00:05:34,816 --> 00:05:37,026
She said we was related to him
in some way.

32
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,486
And what he did was,

33
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:42,823
he started up this club called
the Ku Klux Klan.

34
00:05:42,908 --> 00:05:46,244
They'd all dress up in their robes
and their bed sheets

35
00:05:46,328 --> 00:05:50,665
and act like a bunch of ghosts
or spooks or something.

36
00:05:50,749 --> 00:05:54,627
They'd even put bed sheets
on their horses and ride around.

37
00:05:54,711 --> 00:05:57,755
And anyway, that's how I got my name,

38
00:05:57,839 --> 00:05:59,257
Forrest Gump.

39
00:05:59,341 --> 00:06:01,092
Mama said that the "Forrest" part

40
00:06:01,176 --> 00:06:04,720
was to remind me that sometimes
we all do things that,

41
00:06:04,805 --> 00:06:07,598
well, just don't make no sense.

42
00:06:08,058 --> 00:06:09,058
(CLANG)

43
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:16,774
Okay... Get it, get it...

44
00:06:16,858 --> 00:06:19,819
Wait, is it this way? Hold on.

45
00:06:20,737 --> 00:06:22,238
All right...

46
00:06:22,823 --> 00:06:24,490
What are you all staring at?

47
00:06:24,574 --> 00:06:29,036
Haven't you ever seen a little boy
with braces on his legs before?

48
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:34,292
Don't ever let anybody tell you
they're better than you, Forrest.

49
00:06:34,376 --> 00:06:36,961
If God intended
everybody to be the same,

50
00:06:37,045 --> 00:06:39,170
he'd have given us all braces
on our legs.

51
00:06:39,255 --> 00:06:40,964
FORREST: Mama always had a way of
explaining things

52
00:06:41,048 --> 00:06:43,049
so I could understand them.

53
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:48,013
We lived about a quarter mile
off Route 17,

54
00:06:48,097 --> 00:06:51,141
about a half mile from
the town of Greenbow, Alabama.

55
00:06:51,225 --> 00:06:53,977
That's in the county of Greenbow.

56
00:06:54,061 --> 00:06:58,481
Our house had been in Mama's family
since her grandpa's grandpa's grandpa

57
00:06:58,566 --> 00:07:00,483
had come across the ocean
about 1,000 years ago,

58
00:07:00,568 --> 00:07:02,485
something like that.

59
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:05,280
Since it was just me and Mama
and we had all these empty rooms,

60
00:07:05,364 --> 00:07:08,116
Mama decided to let those rooms out,

61
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,160
mostly to people passing through,

62
00:07:10,244 --> 00:07:14,205
like from, oh, Mobile,
Montgomery, places like that.

63
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:17,000
That's how me and Mama got money.

64
00:07:17,084 --> 00:07:19,836
Mama was a real smart lady.

65
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:24,924
Remember what I told you, Forrest.
You're no different than anybody else is.

66
00:07:27,428 --> 00:07:29,804
Did you hear what I said, Forrest?

67
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:34,059
You're the same as everybody else.
You are no different.

68
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,022
Your boy's different, Mrs. Gump.

69
00:07:39,106 --> 00:07:41,316
Now, his IQ is 75.

70
00:07:42,109 --> 00:07:45,236
Well, we're all different, Mr. Hancock.

71
00:07:48,824 --> 00:07:50,867
FORREST: She wanted me to have
the finest education,

72
00:07:50,951 --> 00:07:54,871
so she took me to
the Greenbow County Central School.

73
00:07:54,955 --> 00:07:57,207
I met the principal and all.

74
00:07:57,708 --> 00:08:00,585
I want to show you something,
Mrs. Gump.

75
00:08:01,045 --> 00:08:03,922
Now, this is normal.

76
00:08:04,423 --> 00:08:07,717
Forrest is right here.

77
00:08:08,552 --> 00:08:14,099
The state requires a minimum IQ of
80 to attend public school, Mrs. Gump.

78
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,477
He's gonna have to go
to a special school.

79
00:08:17,561 --> 00:08:19,687
Now, he'll be just fine.

80
00:08:20,481 --> 00:08:22,565
What does "normal" mean, anyway?

81
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:26,027
He might be a bit on the slow side,

82
00:08:27,154 --> 00:08:28,905
but my boy Forrest is gonna get

83
00:08:28,989 --> 00:08:31,533
the same opportunities
as everyone else.

84
00:08:31,617 --> 00:08:35,412
He's not going to some special school
to learn how to re-tread tires.

85
00:08:35,496 --> 00:08:38,665
We're talking about
five little points here.

86
00:08:40,376 --> 00:08:43,002
There must be something can be done.

87
00:08:44,588 --> 00:08:47,048
We're a progressive school system.

88
00:08:47,883 --> 00:08:50,802
We don't want to see anybody
left behind.

89
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:55,140
Is there a Mr. Gump, Mrs. Gump?

90
00:08:58,394 --> 00:09:00,270
He's on vacation.

91
00:09:01,272 --> 00:09:04,023
(GASPING AND PANTING)

92
00:09:17,745 --> 00:09:21,540
Well, your mama sure does care
about your schooling, son.

93
00:09:27,046 --> 00:09:29,506
You don't say much, do you?

94
00:09:32,886 --> 00:09:36,054
(GASPING AND PANTING)

95
00:09:41,019 --> 00:09:42,978
"Finally, he had to try.

96
00:09:43,062 --> 00:09:45,022
"It looked easy, but,

97
00:09:46,232 --> 00:09:48,567
"oh, what happened.

98
00:09:48,651 --> 00:09:51,653
- "First, there..."
- Mama, what's "vacation" mean?

99
00:09:52,197 --> 00:09:54,781
- Vacation?
- Where Daddy went.

100
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:00,120
Vacation's when you go somewhere

101
00:10:02,499 --> 00:10:04,833
and you don't ever come back.

102
00:10:09,172 --> 00:10:12,966
FORREST: Anyway, I guess you could
say me and Mama was on our own.

103
00:10:14,177 --> 00:10:17,804
But we didn't mind.
Our house was never empty.

104
00:10:17,889 --> 00:10:20,474
There was always folks
coming and going.

105
00:10:20,558 --> 00:10:21,642
MRS. GUMP: Supper.

106
00:10:21,726 --> 00:10:25,145
- It's supper, everyone. Forrest...
- My, my. That sure looks special.

107
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:27,773
FORREST: Sometimes we had
so many people staying with us

108
00:10:27,857 --> 00:10:30,526
that every room
was filled with travelers.

109
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:34,238
You know, folks living out
of their suitcases

110
00:10:34,322 --> 00:10:37,282
and hat cases and sample cases.

111
00:10:37,367 --> 00:10:40,786
Forrest Gump, it's suppertime! Forrest...

112
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:43,413
One time, a young man
was staying with us,

113
00:10:43,498 --> 00:10:47,125
and he had him a guitar case.

114
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:58,095
(SINGING HOUND DOG)

115
00:11:01,099 --> 00:11:05,102
Forrest! I told you not to bother
this nice young man.

116
00:11:05,186 --> 00:11:06,520
ELVIS PRESLEY:
Oh, no, that's all right, ma'am.

117
00:11:06,604 --> 00:11:09,439
I was just showing him a thing or two
on the guitar here.

118
00:11:09,524 --> 00:11:12,484
All right, but your supper's ready
if y'all want to eat.

119
00:11:12,569 --> 00:11:15,529
Yeah, that sounds good.
Thank you, ma'am.

120
00:11:16,197 --> 00:11:19,783
Say, man, show me that crazy
little walk you just did there.

121
00:11:19,867 --> 00:11:21,743
Slow it down some.

122
00:11:21,953 --> 00:11:23,787
(SINGING HOUND DOG)

123
00:11:23,871 --> 00:11:25,789
FORREST: I liked that guitar.

124
00:11:26,457 --> 00:11:28,208
It sounded good.

125
00:11:30,003 --> 00:11:34,172
I started moving around to the music,

126
00:11:34,257 --> 00:11:36,090
swinging my hips.

127
00:11:38,677 --> 00:11:41,220
This one night,
me and Mama was out shopping,

128
00:11:41,305 --> 00:11:44,307
and we walked right by
Benson's furniture and appliance store,

129
00:11:44,391 --> 00:11:45,975
and guess what?

130
00:11:47,436 --> 00:11:50,730
(SINGING HOUND DOG)

131
00:11:58,322 --> 00:12:01,157
This is not for children's eyes.

132
00:12:03,702 --> 00:12:05,494
Some years later,
that handsome young man

133
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:08,122
who they called "The King,"

134
00:12:08,206 --> 00:12:10,541
well, he'd sung too many songs,

135
00:12:11,209 --> 00:12:13,753
had himself a heart attack,
or something.

136
00:12:14,838 --> 00:12:17,006
Must be hard being a king.

137
00:12:21,303 --> 00:12:24,138
You know, it's funny how you remember
some things, but some things you can't.

138
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:28,768
- You do your very best now, Forrest.
- I sure will, Mama.

139
00:12:30,479 --> 00:12:35,066
FORREST: I remember the bus ride
on the first day of school very well.

140
00:12:38,612 --> 00:12:40,321
Are you coming along?

141
00:12:40,405 --> 00:12:43,908
Mama said not to be taking
rides from strangers.

142
00:12:43,992 --> 00:12:46,160
This is the bus to school.

143
00:12:49,122 --> 00:12:51,374
I'm Forrest. Forrest Gump.

144
00:12:52,334 --> 00:12:56,337
- I'm Dorothy Harris.
- Well, now we ain't strangers anymore.

145
00:13:09,351 --> 00:13:11,143
This seat's taken.

146
00:13:13,605 --> 00:13:15,106
It's taken!

147
00:13:22,989 --> 00:13:24,865
You can't sit here.

148
00:13:27,035 --> 00:13:30,454
FORREST: You know, it's funny what
a young man recollects,

149
00:13:30,539 --> 00:13:32,915
'cause I don't remember being born.

150
00:13:34,543 --> 00:13:36,711
I don't recall what I got
for my first Christmas,

151
00:13:36,795 --> 00:13:39,880
and I don't know when I went
on my first outdoor picnic.

152
00:13:39,965 --> 00:13:44,677
But I do remember the first time I heard

153
00:13:44,761 --> 00:13:47,596
the sweetest voice in the wide world.

154
00:13:48,098 --> 00:13:50,474
JENNY: You can sit here if you want.

155
00:13:53,395 --> 00:13:57,273
I had never seen anything
so beautiful in my life.

156
00:13:57,983 --> 00:14:00,067
She was like an angel.

157
00:14:00,152 --> 00:14:03,069
Well, are you gonna sit down,
or aren't you?

158
00:14:08,033 --> 00:14:09,826
What's wrong with your legs?

159
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:14,164
Nothing at all, thank you.
My legs are just fine and dandy.

160
00:14:15,082 --> 00:14:17,250
I just sat next to her on that bus

161
00:14:17,334 --> 00:14:19,419
and had a conversation
all the way to school.

162
00:14:19,503 --> 00:14:22,213
...my back's crooked like
a question mark.

163
00:14:22,298 --> 00:14:23,465
These are going to make me...

164
00:14:23,549 --> 00:14:28,303
And next to Mama, no one ever
talked to me or asked me questions.

165
00:14:28,846 --> 00:14:30,805
Are you stupid or something?

166
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:33,892
Mama says, "Stupid is as stupid does."

167
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,189
- I'm Jenny.
- I'm Forrest. Forrest Gump.

168
00:14:39,857 --> 00:14:41,691
From that day on,
we was always together.

169
00:14:41,776 --> 00:14:44,611
Jenny and me was like
peas and carrots.

170
00:14:48,199 --> 00:14:49,824
She taught me how to climb.

171
00:14:49,909 --> 00:14:52,619
Come on, Forrest, you can do it.

172
00:14:52,703 --> 00:14:55,330
I showed her how to dangle.

173
00:14:55,414 --> 00:14:57,457
"...a good little monkey and..."

174
00:14:57,541 --> 00:15:02,462
She helped me learn how to read,
and I showed her how to swing.

175
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:08,551
Sometimes we'd just sit out
and wait for the stars.

176
00:15:08,636 --> 00:15:13,556
- Mama's gonna worry about me.
- Just stay a little longer.

177
00:15:14,809 --> 00:15:18,561
For some reason,
Jenny didn't never want to go home.

178
00:15:18,646 --> 00:15:20,730
Okay, Jenny, I'll stay.

179
00:15:21,565 --> 00:15:24,317
She was my most special friend.

180
00:15:27,738 --> 00:15:29,405
My only friend.

181
00:15:33,202 --> 00:15:36,996
Now, my mama always told me that
miracles happen every day.

182
00:15:37,081 --> 00:15:39,457
Some people don't think so, but they do.

183
00:15:42,503 --> 00:15:44,087
Hey, dummy!

184
00:15:45,047 --> 00:15:47,131
Are you retarded, orjust plain stupid?

185
00:15:47,216 --> 00:15:50,718
- "Look, I'm Forrest Gimp."
- JENNY: Just run away, Forrest.

186
00:15:52,054 --> 00:15:55,139
Run, Forrest! Run away! Hurry!

187
00:15:55,224 --> 00:15:58,476
- Get the bikes!
- BOY 1: Hurry up! Let's get him!

188
00:15:58,561 --> 00:16:01,104
- Come on!
- Look out, dummy, here we come!

189
00:16:01,188 --> 00:16:03,022
We're gonna get you!

190
00:16:03,983 --> 00:16:07,735
Run, Forrest, run! Run, Forrest!

191
00:16:09,446 --> 00:16:11,364
Come back here, you!

192
00:16:25,004 --> 00:16:27,463
Run, Forrest!

193
00:16:27,548 --> 00:16:28,965
Run!

194
00:17:00,163 --> 00:17:03,040
FORREST: Now, you wouldn't believe it
if I told you,

195
00:17:04,167 --> 00:17:06,668
but I can run like the wind blows.

196
00:17:09,923 --> 00:17:13,008
From that day on,
if I was going somewhere,

197
00:17:13,843 --> 00:17:15,135
I was running!

198
00:17:15,219 --> 00:17:17,596
BOY 1: He's getting away! Stop him!

199
00:17:49,045 --> 00:17:52,047
That boy sure is a running fool.

200
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,636
Now, remember how I told you that

201
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,639
Jenny never seemed
to want to go home?

202
00:18:00,723 --> 00:18:03,809
Well, she lived in a house
that was as old as Alabama.

203
00:18:03,893 --> 00:18:06,061
Her mama had gone up to heaven
when she was five,

204
00:18:06,145 --> 00:18:09,481
and her daddy was
some kind of a farmer.

205
00:18:11,317 --> 00:18:12,359
Jenny?

206
00:18:12,443 --> 00:18:14,611
He was a very loving man.

207
00:18:15,071 --> 00:18:19,324
He was always kissing and touching
her and her sisters.

208
00:18:21,077 --> 00:18:25,497
And then this one time,
Jenny wasn't on the bus to go to school.

209
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:28,625
Jenny, why didn't you come
to school today?

- MR. CURRAN: Jenny!
- Come on!

213
00:18:34,924 --> 00:18:37,467
MR. CURRAN:
Jenny, where'd you run to?

214
00:18:38,803 --> 00:18:41,471
You'd better get back here, girl!

215
00:18:42,932 --> 00:18:44,599
Where you at?

216
00:18:47,979 --> 00:18:51,273
Jenny! Jenny! Where you at?

217
00:18:54,277 --> 00:18:55,610
Jenny!

218
00:18:55,695 --> 00:18:58,655
Pray with me, Forrest. Pray with me.

219
00:18:58,781 --> 00:18:59,905
MR. CURRAN: Jenny!

220
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:03,200
Dear God, make me a bird
so I can fly far,

221
00:19:03,285 --> 00:19:05,036
far, far away from here.

222
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,789
Dear God, make me a bird
so I can fly far,

223
00:19:08,874 --> 00:19:09,999
far, far away from here.

224
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:13,169
Mama always said
that God is mysterious.

225
00:19:13,295 --> 00:19:14,420
Jenny!

226
00:19:14,504 --> 00:19:16,839
He didn't turn Jenny into a bird that day.

227
00:19:16,965 --> 00:19:18,049
You'd better get back here!

228
00:19:18,133 --> 00:19:19,633
Instead,

229
00:19:20,302 --> 00:19:24,847
he had the police say Jenny didn't
have to stay in that house no more.

230
00:19:25,307 --> 00:19:29,018
She went to live with her grandma
just over on Creekmore Avenue,

231
00:19:29,144 --> 00:19:32,313
which made me happy,
'cause she was so close.

232
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:39,945
Some nights, Jenny would sneak out
and come on over to my house,

233
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:43,157
just 'cause she said she was scared.

234
00:19:43,241 --> 00:19:45,701
Scared of what, I don't know,

235
00:19:45,827 --> 00:19:49,038
but I think it was her grandma's dog.

236
00:19:49,164 --> 00:19:50,915
He was a mean dog.

237
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:54,376
Anyway, Jenny and me was best friends

238
00:19:54,461 --> 00:19:55,753
all the way up through high school.

00:25:08,147 --> 00:25:09,147
It was co-ed.

316
00:25:09,232 --> 00:25:11,942
'Cause Jenny went to a college
I couldn't go to.

317
00:25:12,026 --> 00:25:14,361
It was a college just for girls.

318
00:25:14,487 --> 00:25:17,656
But I'd go and visit her
every chance I got.

319
00:25:47,353 --> 00:25:48,311
(JENNY EXCLAIMS)

320
00:25:48,396 --> 00:25:50,021
That hurts.

321
00:26:00,783 --> 00:26:02,951
Forrest! Forrest!

322
00:26:05,204 --> 00:26:08,123
- Forrest, stop it! Stop it!
- BILLY: Jesus!

323
00:26:08,207 --> 00:26:09,332
What are you doing?

324
00:26:09,417 --> 00:26:11,084
- He was hurting you.
- What the hell is going on here?

325
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:14,880
- No, he's not! Get over there!
- Who is that? Who is that?

326
00:26:14,964 --> 00:26:16,047
- Billy, I'm sorry.
- What the hell?

327
00:26:16,132 --> 00:26:18,717
- Just get away from me!
- Don't...

328
00:26:18,801 --> 00:26:21,761
- Don't go! Billy, wait a second!
- Get away from me.

329
00:26:21,888 --> 00:26:24,055
He doesn't know any better!

330
00:26:25,807 --> 00:26:28,476
Forrest, why did you do that?

331
00:26:31,438 --> 00:26:34,398
I brought you some chocolate.

332
00:26:34,774 --> 00:26:36,484
I'm sorry.

333
00:26:38,653 --> 00:26:41,947
- I'll go back to my college now.
- Forrest...

334
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,244
Look at you.

335
00:26:49,331 --> 00:26:51,415
Come on. Come on.

336
00:26:58,924 --> 00:27:00,799
- Is this your room?
- Shh!

337
00:27:05,263 --> 00:27:07,515
Do you ever dream, Forrest,

338
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:11,685
about who you're gonna be?

339
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:13,562
- Who I'm gonna be?
- Yeah.

340
00:27:13,647 --> 00:27:15,523
Aren't I going to be me?

341
00:27:15,607 --> 00:27:19,276
Well, you'll always be you,
just another kind of you.

342
00:27:20,195 --> 00:27:23,447
You know? I want to be famous.

343
00:27:25,158 --> 00:27:27,952
I want to be a singer like Joan Baez.

344
00:27:29,162 --> 00:27:32,289
I just want to be on an empty stage

345
00:27:32,374 --> 00:27:34,667
with my guitar, my voice.

346
00:27:36,503 --> 00:27:37,962
Just me.

347
00:27:39,464 --> 00:27:42,800
And I want to reach people
on the personal level.

348
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:48,806
I want to be able to say things,
just one-to-one.

349
00:27:56,314 --> 00:27:59,191
Have you ever been with a girl, Forrest?

350
00:28:00,652 --> 00:28:04,488
I sit next to them in my Home
Economics class all the time.

351
00:28:30,015 --> 00:28:31,849
(EXCLAIMING)

352
00:28:33,435 --> 00:28:35,853
- I'm... Sorry.
- It's okay.

353
00:28:44,404 --> 00:28:46,113
It's all right.

354
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:51,118
- It's okay.
- Oh, I'm dizzy.

355
00:28:59,793 --> 00:29:02,545
I bet that never happened in Home Ec.

356
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:07,300
(LAUGHING)

357
00:29:07,384 --> 00:29:08,551
No.

358
00:29:14,767 --> 00:29:17,894
I think I ruined
your roommate's bathrobe.

359
00:29:17,978 --> 00:29:20,021
(WHISPERING) I don't care.
I don't like her, anyway.

360
00:29:20,105 --> 00:29:23,483
CROWD: Run! Run! Run!

361
00:29:23,567 --> 00:29:28,071
- Run! Run! Run!
- Run! Run! Run!

362
00:29:35,996 --> 00:29:40,208
FORREST: College ran by real fast,
'cause I played so much football.

363
00:29:40,292 --> 00:29:43,544
They even put me on a thing
called the All-America Team,

364
00:29:43,629 --> 00:29:47,423
where you get to meet
the President of the United States.

365
00:29:47,508 --> 00:29:49,092
REPORTER: President Kennedy met
with the Collegiate

366
00:29:49,176 --> 00:29:52,762
All-American Football Team
at the Oval Office today.

367
00:29:53,347 --> 00:29:55,348
FORREST: Now, the really good thing
about meeting

368
00:29:55,432 --> 00:29:59,227
the President of the United States
is the food.

369
00:29:59,311 --> 00:30:02,021
They put you in this little room
with just about anything

370
00:30:02,106 --> 00:30:04,607
you'd want to eat or drink.

371
00:30:05,109 --> 00:30:08,569
And since, number one,
I wasn't hungry, but thirsty,

372
00:30:08,654 --> 00:30:11,322
and number two, they was free,

373
00:30:11,448 --> 00:30:14,492
I must have drank me about
15 Dr. Peppers.

374
00:30:15,285 --> 00:30:16,285
(BURPS)

375
00:30:17,454 --> 00:30:19,580
KENNEDY: Congratulations.
How does it feel to be an All-American?

376
00:30:19,665 --> 00:30:21,416
PLAYER 1: It's an honor, sir.

377
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,584
KENNEDY: Congratulations.
How does it feel to be an All-American?

378
00:30:23,669 --> 00:30:25,294
PLAYER 2: Very good, sir.

379
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:28,548
Congratulations.
How does it feel to be an All-American?

380
00:30:28,632 --> 00:30:30,383
Very good, sir.

381
00:30:30,467 --> 00:30:34,137
- Congratulations. How do you feel?
- I gotta pee.

382
00:30:34,805 --> 00:30:37,098
(CHUCKLING) I believe he said
he had to "go pee."

383
00:30:52,322 --> 00:30:55,199
FORREST: Sometime later,
for no particular reason,

384
00:30:55,325 --> 00:30:57,702
somebody shot that
nice young President,

385
00:30:57,828 --> 00:31:00,204
when he was riding in his car.

386
00:31:00,831 --> 00:31:04,959
And a few years after that,
somebody shot his little brother, too,

387
00:31:05,043 --> 00:31:07,170
only he was in a hotel kitchen.

388
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:11,048
It must be hard being brothers.

389
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:13,259
I wouldn't know.

390
00:31:13,844 --> 00:31:15,219
Forrest Gump.

391
00:31:15,345 --> 00:31:16,596
FORREST: Now can you believe it?

392
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:20,600
After only five years of playing football,
I got a college degree.

393
00:31:20,684 --> 00:31:22,684
Congratulations, son.

394
00:31:23,478 --> 00:31:25,520
Mama was so proud.

395
00:31:26,856 --> 00:31:30,692
Forrest, I'm so proud of you.
Here, I'll hold this for you.

396
00:31:30,818 --> 00:31:32,903
Congratulations, son.

397
00:31:33,029 --> 00:31:36,031
Have you given any thought
to your future?

398
00:31:37,867 --> 00:31:39,201
Thought?

399
00:31:40,661 --> 00:31:42,496
Hello, I'm Forrest. Forrest Gump.

400
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:45,582
Nobody gives a hunk of shit
who you are, fuzzball!

401
00:31:45,708 --> 00:31:48,335
You're not even a low-life,
scum-sucking maggot!

402
00:31:48,419 --> 00:31:52,380
Get your faggotty ass on the bus.
You're in the Army now!

403
00:31:52,715 --> 00:31:54,508
This seat's taken.

404
00:31:56,385 --> 00:31:57,761
Taken.

405
00:32:00,681 --> 00:32:03,475
FORREST: At first, it seemed like
I made a mistake,

406
00:32:03,559 --> 00:32:05,602
seeing how it was only my induction day

407
00:32:05,728 --> 00:32:08,438
and I was already getting yelled at.

408
00:32:11,526 --> 00:32:13,777
You can sit down if you want to.

409
00:32:13,903 --> 00:32:17,739
I didn't know who I might meet,
or what they might ask.

410
00:32:17,865 --> 00:32:20,450
You ever been on a real shrimp boat?

411
00:32:20,952 --> 00:32:24,579
No, but I been on a real big boat.

412
00:32:25,373 --> 00:32:28,166
I'm talking about
a shrimp-catching boat.

413
00:32:28,251 --> 00:32:30,752
I've been working
on shrimp boats all my life.

414
00:32:30,878 --> 00:32:33,630
I started out on my uncle's boat,
that's my mama's brother,

415
00:32:33,756 --> 00:32:35,799
when I was about maybe nine.

416
00:32:35,925 --> 00:32:40,053
I was just looking into buying a boat
of my own and got drafted.

417
00:32:40,888 --> 00:32:45,767
My given name is Benjamin Buford Blue.
People call me Bubba.

418
00:32:46,435 --> 00:32:50,063
Just like one of them old redneck boys.
Can you believe that?

419
00:32:50,147 --> 00:32:53,817
My name's Forrest Gump.
People call me Forrest Gump.

420
00:32:54,777 --> 00:32:57,195
FORREST: So, Bubba was from
Bayou La Batre, Alabama,

421
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,197
and his mama cooked shrimp,

422
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:04,327
and her mama before her
cooked shrimp,

423
00:33:04,453 --> 00:33:07,414
and her mama before her mama
cooked shrimp, too.

424
00:33:07,498 --> 00:33:08,707
Bubba's family knew everything

425
00:33:08,791 --> 00:33:11,418
there was to know
about the shrimping business.

426
00:33:11,502 --> 00:33:14,546
I know everything there is to know
about the shrimping business.

427
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:17,632
Matter of fact, I'm going into
the shrimping business for myself

428
00:33:17,758 --> 00:33:20,093
after I get out the Army.

429
00:33:22,763 --> 00:33:23,805
Okay.

430
00:33:24,015 --> 00:33:28,101
Gump! What's your sole purpose
in this Army?

431
00:33:28,185 --> 00:33:30,729
To do whatever you tell me,
Drill Sergeant!

432
00:33:30,813 --> 00:33:34,190
God damn it, Gump!
You're a goddamn genius!

433
00:33:34,317 --> 00:33:36,651
That's the most outstanding answer
I've ever heard.

434
00:33:36,777 --> 00:33:39,529
You must have a goddamn IQ of 160!

435
00:33:39,655 --> 00:33:42,616
You are goddamn gifted, Private Gump!

436
00:33:43,618 --> 00:33:45,493
Listen up, people!

437
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:49,788
FORREST: Now, for some reason, I fit in
the Army like one of them round pegs.

438
00:33:49,873 --> 00:33:51,123
It's not really hard.

439
00:33:51,207 --> 00:33:54,835
You just make your bed real neat
and remember to stand up straight,

440
00:33:54,961 --> 00:33:58,923
and always answer every question
with, "Yes, Drill Sergeant!"

441
00:33:59,007 --> 00:34:00,466
DRILL SERGEANT: Is that clear?

442
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:02,676
- Yes, Drill Sergeant!
- Yes, Drill Sergeant!

443
00:34:03,178 --> 00:34:06,472
What you do is, you just drag
your nets along the bottom.

444
00:34:06,556 --> 00:34:10,309
On a good day, you can catch over
100 pounds of shrimp.

445
00:34:10,393 --> 00:34:13,812
If everything goes all right,
two men shrimping 10 hours,

446
00:34:13,897 --> 00:34:16,607
less what you spend on gas, you can...

447
00:34:16,691 --> 00:34:19,485
- Done, Drill Sergeant!
- Gump!

448
00:34:21,863 --> 00:34:24,615
Why did you put that weapon
together so quickly, Gump?

449
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:26,367
You told me to, Drill Sergeant.

450
00:34:26,493 --> 00:34:29,912
Jesus H. Christ,
this is a new company record.

451
00:34:30,038 --> 00:34:32,498
If it wouldn't be a waste
of such a damn fine enlisted man,

452
00:34:32,582 --> 00:34:34,875
I'd recommend you for OCS,
Private Gump.

453
00:34:35,001 --> 00:34:36,835
You are gonna be
a general some day, Gump.

454
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:40,005
Now, disassemble your weapon
and continue!

455
00:34:42,092 --> 00:34:45,886
Anyway, like I was saying,
shrimp is the fruit of the sea.

456
00:34:45,971 --> 00:34:50,724
You can barbecue it,
boil it, broil it, bake it, sauté it.

457
00:34:50,809 --> 00:34:53,811
There's shrimp kebabs, shrimp Creole...

458
00:34:54,104 --> 00:34:58,941
...shrimp gumbo, pan fried,
deep fried, stir fried.

459
00:34:59,275 --> 00:35:02,820
There's pineapple shrimp,
lemon shrimp,

460
00:35:02,904 --> 00:35:05,239
coconut shrimp, pepper shrimp...

461
00:35:05,573 --> 00:35:11,537
...shrimp soup, shrimp stew,
shrimp salad, shrimp and potatoes,

462
00:35:11,621 --> 00:35:14,665
shrimp burger, shrimp sandwich...

463
00:35:17,252 --> 00:35:19,586
That's... That's about it.

464
00:35:23,299 --> 00:35:26,260
FORREST: Night time in the Army
is a lonely time.

465
00:35:27,137 --> 00:35:30,764
We'd lay there in our bunks
and I'd miss my mama.

466
00:35:31,349 --> 00:35:33,851
And I'd miss Jenny.

467
00:35:37,772 --> 00:35:41,650
Hey, Gump, get a load of the tits on her!

468
00:35:55,123 --> 00:35:58,250
Turns out, Jenny had gotten into
some trouble over

469
00:35:58,334 --> 00:36:01,670
some photos of her
in her college sweater,

470
00:36:01,796 --> 00:36:04,339
and she was thrown out of school.

471
00:36:07,886 --> 00:36:10,095
But that wasn't a bad thing,

472
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:13,766
because a man who owns
a theater in Memphis, Tennessee,

473
00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:18,895
saw those photos and offered Jenny
a job singing in a show.

474
00:36:19,688 --> 00:36:21,522
The first chance I got,

475
00:36:21,648 --> 00:36:25,318
I took the bus up to Memphis
to see her perform in that show.

476
00:36:25,402 --> 00:36:26,903
That was Amber, Amber Flame.

477
00:36:26,987 --> 00:36:29,447
Give her a big hand, guys.
Good job, Amber.

478
00:36:29,531 --> 00:36:32,283
And now, for your listening
and viewing pleasure,

479
00:36:32,367 --> 00:36:36,204
direct from Hollywood, California,
our very own beatnik beauty,

480
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:39,999
let's give a big round of applause
to the luscious Bobbi Dylan.

481
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:42,085
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

482
00:36:42,169 --> 00:36:44,420
MAN 1: All right!
MAN 2: Bobbi!

483
00:36:49,301 --> 00:36:53,971
(SINGING BLOWIN' IN THE WIND)

484
00:37:07,361 --> 00:37:09,445
Her dream had come true.

485
00:37:10,697 --> 00:37:12,698
She was a folk singer.

486
00:37:21,959 --> 00:37:24,210
MAN 3: Come on, baby. Shake it up.
Shake it up, now.

487
00:37:24,294 --> 00:37:25,795
MAN 4: Hey, buddy, get her a harmonica.

488
00:37:26,004 --> 00:37:27,588
(CROWD LAUGHING)

489
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:31,592
MAN 1: Hey, honey,
this ain't Captain Kangaroo.

490
00:37:31,718 --> 00:37:34,262
Hey, honey,
I got something here for you.

491
00:37:35,305 --> 00:37:39,058
- God damn it!
- Hey! Hey! Stupid jerk!

492
00:37:39,143 --> 00:37:41,602
I'm singing a song here.

493
00:37:43,939 --> 00:37:46,357
Polly, get out here!

494
00:37:46,441 --> 00:37:48,151
- Shut up, there!
- MAN 2: Don't be so shy, honey.

495
00:37:48,235 --> 00:37:49,777
JENNY: Oh, shut up!

496
00:37:52,447 --> 00:37:55,199
Forrest, what are you doing here?

497
00:37:55,284 --> 00:37:56,993
- What are you doing?
- MAN 3: Hey!

498
00:37:57,077 --> 00:37:58,452
- Come on.
- What are you doing?

499
00:37:58,579 --> 00:38:00,580
Forrest, let me down!

500
00:38:01,915 --> 00:38:02,915
(CROWD EXCLAIMING)

501
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:08,337
You can't keep doing this, Forrest.

502
00:38:08,422 --> 00:38:10,506
You can't keep trying
to rescue me all the time.

503
00:38:10,591 --> 00:38:14,677
- They was trying to grab you.
- A lot of people try to grab me.

504
00:38:15,596 --> 00:38:18,764
Just... You can't keep
doing this all the time.

505
00:38:19,266 --> 00:38:22,185
I can't help it. I love you.

506
00:38:23,145 --> 00:38:26,647
Forrest, you don't know what love is.

507
00:38:33,947 --> 00:38:36,949
You remember that time
we prayed, Forrest?

508
00:38:37,826 --> 00:38:42,330
We prayed for God to turn me
into a bird so I could fly far, far away?

509
00:38:44,291 --> 00:38:45,666
Yes, I do.

510
00:38:49,629 --> 00:38:52,464
You think I could fly off this bridge?

511
00:38:59,138 --> 00:39:01,306
What do you mean, Jenny?

512
00:39:05,186 --> 00:39:06,686
Nothing.

513
00:39:09,649 --> 00:39:11,691
I gotta get out of here.

514
00:39:13,986 --> 00:39:15,070
Wait, Jenny...

515
00:39:15,154 --> 00:39:19,616
Forrest, you stay away from me, okay?
You just stay away from me, please.

516
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:20,992
Can I have a ride?

517
00:39:21,077 --> 00:39:22,619
- MAN: Where you going?
- I don't care.

518
00:39:22,703 --> 00:39:24,079
Get in the truck.

519
00:39:24,163 --> 00:39:25,997
So, bye-bye, Jenny.

520
00:39:28,501 --> 00:39:30,835
They sending me to Vietnam.

521
00:39:33,589 --> 00:39:36,007
It's this whole other country.

522
00:39:38,511 --> 00:39:40,512
Just hang on a minute.

523
00:39:41,931 --> 00:39:44,975
Listen, you promise me
something, okay?

524
00:39:45,059 --> 00:39:48,395
Just, if you're ever in trouble,
don't try to be brave. You just run, okay?

525
00:39:48,521 --> 00:39:50,105
Just run away.

526
00:39:51,357 --> 00:39:52,691
Okay.

527
00:39:57,571 --> 00:39:58,905
Jenny.

528
00:40:00,783 --> 00:40:03,076
I'll write you all the time.

529
00:40:12,211 --> 00:40:15,213
FORREST: And just like that,
she was gone.

530
00:40:31,314 --> 00:40:34,649
You come back safe to me,
do you hear?

531
00:41:17,942 --> 00:41:21,904
Now, they told us that Vietnam
was gonna be very different

532
00:41:21,988 --> 00:41:24,865
from the United States of America.

533
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:29,995
And except for all the beer cans
and the barbecue, it was.

534
00:41:40,131 --> 00:41:43,217
Hey, I bet there's shrimp
all in these waters.

535
00:41:43,301 --> 00:41:46,470
They tell me these Vietnams
is good shrimpers.

536
00:41:46,554 --> 00:41:50,099
You know, after we win this war,
and we take over everything,

537
00:41:50,183 --> 00:41:51,392
we can get American shrimpers

538
00:41:51,476 --> 00:41:53,227
to come out here
and shrimp these waters.

539
00:41:53,311 --> 00:41:54,853
We'll just shrimp all the time, man.

540
00:41:54,979 --> 00:41:58,148
So much shrimp, why,
you wouldn't believe it.

541
00:41:58,817 --> 00:42:00,734
You must be my FNGs.

542
00:42:00,819 --> 00:42:02,069
- Morning, sir!
- Morning, sir!

543
00:42:02,153 --> 00:42:04,780
Get your hands down! Do not salute me.

544
00:42:04,864 --> 00:42:06,990
There's goddamn snipers
all around this area

545
00:42:07,075 --> 00:42:09,910
who would love to grease an officer.

546
00:42:09,994 --> 00:42:13,497
I'm Lieutenant Dan Taylor.
Welcome to Fourth Platoon.

547
00:42:14,374 --> 00:42:16,792
What's wrong with your lip?

548
00:42:16,876 --> 00:42:19,253
I was born with big gums, sir.

549
00:42:19,337 --> 00:42:24,049
Yeah, well, you better tuck that in.
Gonna get that caught on a trip wire.

550
00:42:25,218 --> 00:42:26,593
Where you boys from in the world?

551
00:42:26,678 --> 00:42:29,054
- Alabama, sir!
- Alabama, sir!

552
00:42:29,764 --> 00:42:31,265
You twins?

553
00:42:33,351 --> 00:42:35,769
No, we are not relations, sir.

554
00:42:38,022 --> 00:42:40,941
Look, it's pretty basic here.

555
00:42:41,734 --> 00:42:44,194
If you stick with me
and learn from the guys

556
00:42:44,279 --> 00:42:46,947
who've been in country a while,
you'll be all right.

557
00:42:47,031 --> 00:42:48,949
There is one item of GI gear

558
00:42:49,033 --> 00:42:53,203
that can be the difference between
a live grunt and a dead grunt.

559
00:42:53,538 --> 00:42:56,707
Socks. Cushion sole, OD green.

560
00:42:56,791 --> 00:42:58,083
Try and keep your feet dry.

561
00:42:58,209 --> 00:42:59,626
When we're out humping,
I want you boys to remember

562
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:02,171
to change your socks whenever we stop.

563
00:43:02,255 --> 00:43:05,215
The Mekong will eat a grunt's feet
right off his legs.

564
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:07,593
Sergeant Sims, God damn it,

565
00:43:07,719 --> 00:43:09,136
where is that sling rope
I told you to order?

566
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:11,138
I put in the requisitions at Battalion.

567
00:43:11,222 --> 00:43:13,223
DAN: Yeah, yeah, yeah, well,
you call those sons of bitches again...

568
00:43:13,308 --> 00:43:15,851
FORREST: Lieutenant Dan
sure knew his stuff.

569
00:43:15,935 --> 00:43:18,228
I felt real lucky he was my lieutenant.

570
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:22,441
He was from a long,
great military tradition.

571
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:25,736
Somebody in his family
had fought and died

572
00:43:26,738 --> 00:43:30,991
in every single American war.

573
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:33,911
- God damn it, kick some ass!
- I'm on it, Lieutenant.

574
00:43:33,995 --> 00:43:35,120
Get on it!

575
00:43:35,246 --> 00:43:38,582
I guess you could say he had
a lot to live up to.

576
00:43:40,293 --> 00:43:45,129
So, you boys are from Arkansas, huh?
Well, I've been through there.

577
00:43:45,255 --> 00:43:47,423
Little Rock's a fine town.

578
00:43:48,091 --> 00:43:51,677
Now, go shake down your gear,
see the platoon sergeant,

579
00:43:51,762 --> 00:43:54,222
draw what you need for the field.

580
00:43:54,306 --> 00:43:58,267
If you boys are hungry,
we got steaks burning right over here.

581
00:43:58,352 --> 00:44:01,229
Two standing orders in this platoon:

582
00:44:01,313 --> 00:44:03,981
One, take good care of your feet,

583
00:44:04,107 --> 00:44:09,153
two, try not to do anything stupid,
like getting yourself killed.

584
00:44:15,619 --> 00:44:17,703
I sure hope I don't let him down.

585
00:44:29,299 --> 00:44:31,801
FORREST: I got to see
a lot of the countryside.

586
00:44:31,885 --> 00:44:34,220
We would take these real long walks.

587
00:44:42,688 --> 00:44:46,816
And we were always looking
for this guy named Charlie.

588
00:44:54,658 --> 00:44:56,909
DAN: Hold it up!
SOLDIER: Hold up, boys!

589
00:44:59,746 --> 00:45:02,081
It wasn't always fun.

590
00:45:02,165 --> 00:45:06,460
Lieutenant Dan was always getting
these funny feelings about a rock,

591
00:45:06,545 --> 00:45:11,632
or a trail, or the road,
so he'd tell us to get down, shut up...

592
00:45:11,717 --> 00:45:13,718
Get down! Shut up!

593
00:45:14,678 --> 00:45:16,137
(WHISPERING)... so we did.

594
00:45:33,697 --> 00:45:35,865
Now, I don't know much about anything,

595
00:45:35,949 --> 00:45:39,785
but I think some of America's
best young men served in this war.

596
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:42,580
There was Dallas, from Phoenix,

597
00:45:44,291 --> 00:45:47,084
Cleveland, he was from Detroit.

598
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:49,587
(WHISPERING) Hey, Tex. Hey, Tex.

599
00:45:49,713 --> 00:45:51,881
Man, what the hell's going on?

600
00:45:51,965 --> 00:45:56,302
And Tex was... Well, I don't remember
where Tex come from.

601
00:45:56,386 --> 00:45:57,928
DAN: Nothing.

602
00:46:02,059 --> 00:46:04,560
Fourth Platoon, on your feet.

603
00:46:04,645 --> 00:46:08,356
Still got 10 klicks to go to that river.
Move out.

604
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:10,232
Come on, move out.

605
00:46:12,276 --> 00:46:14,694
Step it up. Look alive out there.

606
00:46:14,779 --> 00:46:19,115
The good thing about Vietnam
is there was always some place to go.

607
00:46:19,241 --> 00:46:20,617
DAN: Fire in the hole!

608
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:26,414
Gump, check out that hole.

609
00:46:26,499 --> 00:46:29,501
And there was always something to do.

610
00:46:29,585 --> 00:46:32,754
- Mount them up.
- SOLDIER: Spread out! Cover his back.

611
00:46:37,802 --> 00:46:43,431
One day, it started raining,
and it didn't quit for four months.

612
00:46:44,433 --> 00:46:47,310
We'd been through
every kind of rain there is:

613
00:46:47,436 --> 00:46:49,979
Little bitty stinging rain,

614
00:46:50,690 --> 00:46:53,358
and big old fat rain,

615
00:46:53,818 --> 00:46:56,528
rain that flew in sideways.

616
00:46:56,612 --> 00:47:00,657
And sometimes, rain even seemed
to come straight up from underneath.

617
00:47:02,451 --> 00:47:04,828
Shoot, it even rained at night.

618
00:47:05,871 --> 00:47:08,331
- Hey, Forrest.
- Hey, Bubba.

619
00:47:08,457 --> 00:47:11,751
I'm gonna lean up against you.
You just lean right back against me.

620
00:47:11,836 --> 00:47:15,672
This way, we don't have to sleep
with our heads in the mud.

621
00:47:16,632 --> 00:47:20,093
You know why we a good partnership,
Forrest?

622
00:47:20,177 --> 00:47:22,679
'Cause we be watching out
for one another,

623
00:47:22,805 --> 00:47:24,681
like brothers and stuff.

624
00:47:26,642 --> 00:47:30,311
Hey, Forrest, there's something
I've been thinking about.

625
00:47:30,396 --> 00:47:33,398
I got a very important question
to ask you.

626
00:47:35,025 --> 00:47:38,987
How would you like to go
into the shrimping business with me?

627
00:47:40,156 --> 00:47:41,781
Okay.

628
00:47:41,866 --> 00:47:45,326
Man, I tell you what,
I got it all figured out, too.

629
00:47:45,411 --> 00:47:48,204
So many pounds of shrimp
to pay off the boat,

630
00:47:48,330 --> 00:47:51,624
so many pounds for gas,
we can just live right on the boat.

631
00:47:51,709 --> 00:47:54,002
We ain't got to pay no rent.

632
00:47:54,086 --> 00:47:56,171
I'll be the captain,
we can just work it together,

633
00:47:56,255 --> 00:48:00,508
split everything right down the middle.
Man, I'm telling you, 50-50.

634
00:48:00,593 --> 00:48:04,179
And, hey, Forrest,
all the shrimp you can eat.

635
00:48:05,723 --> 00:48:07,515
That's a fine idea.

636
00:48:08,601 --> 00:48:10,727
FORREST: Bubba did have a fine idea.

637
00:48:14,523 --> 00:48:17,609
I even wrote Jenny
and told her all about it.

638
00:48:18,402 --> 00:48:21,613
I sent her letters,
not every day, but almost.

639
00:48:21,697 --> 00:48:26,701
I told her what I was doing
and asked her what she was doing,

640
00:48:26,786 --> 00:48:29,537
and told her
how I thought about her always,

641
00:48:30,873 --> 00:48:33,833
and how I was looking forward
to getting a letter from her

642
00:48:33,918 --> 00:48:36,419
just as soon as she had the time.

643
00:48:38,297 --> 00:48:40,798
I'd always let her know that I was okay.

644
00:48:42,091 --> 00:48:47,262
Then, I'd sign each letter,
"Love, Forrest Gump."

645
00:49:02,111 --> 00:49:05,864
This one day, we was out walking,
like always,

646
00:49:05,949 --> 00:49:08,909
and then, just like that,

647
00:49:09,828 --> 00:49:13,247
somebody turned off the rain
and the sun come out.

648
00:49:16,251 --> 00:49:18,085
DAN: Ambush!

649
00:49:18,586 --> 00:49:19,962
Take cover!

650
00:49:20,129 --> 00:49:21,505
(GUNS FIRING)

651
00:49:23,591 --> 00:49:24,758
Get down!

652
00:49:24,843 --> 00:49:26,301
Get the sixty!

653
00:49:29,472 --> 00:49:31,557
Get that pig up here, God damn it!

654
00:49:31,641 --> 00:49:33,767
Forrest, you okay?

655
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:39,606
Strongarm! Strongarm!
Be advised, Strongarm!

656
00:49:40,149 --> 00:49:42,568
Medic, we got a man down!

657
00:49:42,652 --> 00:49:45,612
Strongarm, this is Leg Lima 6, over!

658
00:49:46,322 --> 00:49:49,658
Roger, Strongarm, be advised
we have incoming from the tree line

659
00:49:49,784 --> 00:49:53,287
at points blue plus two.
AKs and rockets...

660
00:49:53,955 --> 00:49:55,747
Misfire! Misfire!

661
00:49:58,126 --> 00:50:00,127
DAN: God damn it! Mac!

662
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:04,506
Get that thing...
Fuck it, get it in the tree line!

663
00:50:05,466 --> 00:50:06,633
Jesus!

664
00:50:06,759 --> 00:50:08,969
My unit is down hard and hurting!

665
00:50:09,095 --> 00:50:12,639
Six are pulling back to Blue Line,
Leg Lima 6 out.

666
00:50:13,433 --> 00:50:15,392
Pull back! Pull back!

667
00:50:15,476 --> 00:50:17,603
Run! Run, Forrest!

668
00:50:17,687 --> 00:50:20,022
- Pull back!
- BUBBA: Forrest, Forrest!

669
00:50:20,148 --> 00:50:22,733
Run, man! Run!

670
00:50:22,817 --> 00:50:24,610
DAN: Pull back! Run!

671
00:50:26,446 --> 00:50:28,655
Run, God damn it, run!

672
00:50:49,844 --> 00:50:54,473
SOLDIER: Medic! Can I get a medic?

673
00:50:54,849 --> 00:50:58,185
FORREST: I ran and ran,
just like Jenny told me to.

674
00:51:01,564 --> 00:51:05,776
I ran so far and so fast
that pretty soon I was all by myself,

675
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:07,818
which was a bad thing.

676
00:51:08,362 --> 00:51:09,904
Bubba!

677
00:51:12,032 --> 00:51:15,826
Bubba was my best good friend.
I had to make sure that he was okay.

678
00:51:19,539 --> 00:51:21,582
SOLDIER 1: Any friendlies out there?

679
00:51:22,542 --> 00:51:24,710
SOLDIER 2: Yeah, I've got
three over here.

680
00:51:25,337 --> 00:51:27,338
Where the hell are you?

681
00:51:27,923 --> 00:51:29,256
Bubba?

682
00:51:30,342 --> 00:51:33,052
And on my way back to find Bubba,

683
00:51:33,178 --> 00:51:35,972
well, there was this boy
laying on the ground.

684
00:51:36,056 --> 00:51:37,264
Tex!

685
00:51:39,351 --> 00:51:40,351
Okay.

686
00:51:40,435 --> 00:51:44,397
I couldn't just let him lay there all alone,
scared the way he was,

687
00:51:44,523 --> 00:51:48,401
so I grabbed him up
and run him out of there.

688
00:52:03,542 --> 00:52:05,960
And every time I went back
looking for Bubba,

689
00:52:06,086 --> 00:52:09,588
somebody else was saying,
"Help me, Forrest. Help me."

690
00:52:17,264 --> 00:52:19,140
Can't hear... Can't hear...

691
00:52:21,435 --> 00:52:22,727
SOLDIER: No sweat, man. Just lay back.

692
00:52:22,811 --> 00:52:25,312
You'll be okay. You'll be okay.

693
00:52:27,315 --> 00:52:30,359
I started to get scared
that I might never find Bubba.

694
00:52:30,444 --> 00:52:31,694
MAN ON RADIO: Over.

695
00:52:31,778 --> 00:52:35,072
DAN: Roger, Strongarm,
I know my position is danger close.

696
00:52:35,157 --> 00:52:36,991
We got Charlie all over this area.

697
00:52:37,117 --> 00:52:39,410
I gotta have those fast movers
in here now. Over.

698
00:52:39,494 --> 00:52:42,872
- Six, Strongarm, we want...
- Lieutenant Dan, Coleman's dead!

699
00:52:42,956 --> 00:52:44,165
I know he's dead!

700
00:52:44,291 --> 00:52:47,126
My whole goddamn platoon
is wiped out!

701
00:52:47,252 --> 00:52:48,586
- Leg Lima 6, Leg Lima 6.
- God damn it!

702
00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:51,380
- Copy this transmission. Over.
- What are you doing?

703
00:52:51,465 --> 00:52:54,800
Just leave me here! Get away.
Just leave me here! Get out!

704
00:52:54,926 --> 00:52:57,219
Leg Lima 6, Strongarm.
How copy this? Over.

705
00:52:57,304 --> 00:52:59,930
God, I said leave me here, God damn it!

706
00:53:00,015 --> 00:53:03,184
Leg Lima 6, Leg Lima 6,
this is Strongarm, be advised

707
00:53:03,310 --> 00:53:05,269
your fast movers
are inbound at this time, over.

708
00:53:05,353 --> 00:53:08,773
FORREST: Then, it felt like something
just jumped up and bit me.

709
00:53:09,649 --> 00:53:11,317
Something bit me!

710
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:20,326
You chink son of a bitch!

711
00:53:22,829 --> 00:53:24,830
I can't leave the platoon.

712
00:53:24,956 --> 00:53:29,877
I told you to leave me there, Gump.
Forget about me. Get yourself out!

713
00:53:30,003 --> 00:53:32,129
Did you hear what I said?

714
00:53:32,839 --> 00:53:34,799
God damn it, put me down!

715
00:53:35,509 --> 00:53:37,550
Get your ass out of here!

716
00:53:40,846 --> 00:53:43,431
I didn't ask you to pull me out of there,
God damn you!

717
00:53:43,516 --> 00:53:44,849
Where the hell
do you think you're going?

718
00:53:44,975 --> 00:53:46,059
To get Bubba.

719
00:53:46,185 --> 00:53:50,021
I got an air strike inbound right now.
They're gonna nape the whole area.

720
00:53:50,147 --> 00:53:52,524
Gump, you stay here, God damn it!
That's an order!

721
00:53:52,650 --> 00:53:55,068
I gotta find Bubba!

722
00:54:11,043 --> 00:54:12,502
BUBBA: Forrest.

723
00:54:20,261 --> 00:54:22,929
- Bubba.
- I'm okay, Forrest.

724
00:54:23,722 --> 00:54:25,390
I'm okay.

725
00:54:33,232 --> 00:54:35,066
Oh, Bubba, no...

726
00:54:35,192 --> 00:54:37,402
Nah, I'm gonna be all right.

727
00:54:39,321 --> 00:54:41,156
(MEN CHATTERING)

728
00:54:45,578 --> 00:54:48,246
Come on. Come on. Come on.

729
00:54:53,252 --> 00:54:54,752
I'm okay, Forrest.

730
00:54:56,088 --> 00:54:58,923
I'm okay, man. I'm fine.

731
00:55:35,961 --> 00:55:39,088
DAN: Helo's inbound.
Top smoke, get it out there!

732
00:55:40,132 --> 00:55:44,636
If I'd a known this was gonna be the
last time me and Bubba was gonna talk,

733
00:55:44,762 --> 00:55:47,055
I'd of thought of something better to say.

734
00:55:47,139 --> 00:55:48,640
Hey, Bubba.

735
00:55:49,767 --> 00:55:51,142
Hey, Forrest.

736
00:55:53,479 --> 00:55:56,689
Forrest, why'd this happen?

737
00:55:58,025 --> 00:55:59,817
You got shot.

738
00:56:01,528 --> 00:56:05,697
Then Bubba said something
I won't ever forget.

739
00:56:06,491 --> 00:56:08,158
I wanna go home.

740
00:56:10,161 --> 00:56:12,204
Bubba was my best good friend.

741
00:56:13,164 --> 00:56:17,709
And even I know that ain't something
you can find just around the corner.

742
00:56:17,835 --> 00:56:20,921
Bubba was gonna be
a shrimping boat captain,

743
00:56:21,005 --> 00:56:24,967
but instead he died right there
by that river in Vietnam.

744
00:56:30,682 --> 00:56:32,975
That's all I have to say about that.

745
00:56:35,353 --> 00:56:37,521
It was a bullet, wasn't it?

746
00:56:39,857 --> 00:56:42,526
- A bullet?
- That jumped up and bit you.

747
00:56:44,904 --> 00:56:46,989
Oh, yes, sir.

748
00:56:47,073 --> 00:56:50,200
Bit me directly in the buttocks.

749
00:56:50,326 --> 00:56:55,580
They said it was a million-dollar wound,
but the Army must keep that money,

750
00:56:55,707 --> 00:56:59,543
'cause I still ain't seen a nickel
of that million dollars.

751
00:57:00,378 --> 00:57:03,880
The only good thing
about being wounded in the buttocks

752
00:57:04,007 --> 00:57:05,716
is the ice cream.

753
00:57:05,842 --> 00:57:08,427
They gave me all the ice cream
I could eat.

754
00:57:08,553 --> 00:57:09,845
And guess what?

755
00:57:09,929 --> 00:57:13,056
A good friend of mine
was in the bed right next door.

756
00:57:15,268 --> 00:57:18,353
Lieutenant Dan,
I got you some ice cream.

757
00:57:20,732 --> 00:57:22,899
Lieutenant Dan, ice cream.

758
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:36,913
MALE NURSE:
It's time for your bath, Lieutenant.

759
00:57:45,423 --> 00:57:46,757
Harper!

760
00:57:49,969 --> 00:57:52,429
Cooper, Larson,

761
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:55,974
Webster,

762
00:57:57,393 --> 00:58:00,896
- Gump. Gump.
- I'm Forrest Gump.

763
00:58:04,442 --> 00:58:07,736
Kyle, Nichols,

764
00:58:09,947 --> 00:58:15,911
McMill, Johnson, Tyler,

765
00:58:17,246 --> 00:58:18,622
Holiday...

766
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:27,631
MAN ON TV:
Surprise, surprise, surprise!

767
00:58:30,968 --> 00:58:33,469
Gump, how can you watch
that stupid shit?

768
00:58:33,553 --> 00:58:35,137
- From the DMZ to the Delta...
- Turn it off!

769
00:58:35,222 --> 00:58:38,474
...you are tuned to the
American Forces Vietnam Network.

770
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:40,935
This is Channel 6, Saigon.

771
00:58:43,647 --> 00:58:45,314
SOLDIER: Good catch, Gump.

772
00:58:47,275 --> 00:58:49,443
You know how to play this?

773
00:58:50,737 --> 00:58:52,822
Come on, let me show you. Here.

774
00:58:54,908 --> 00:58:57,243
Now, the secret to this game is,

775
00:58:57,327 --> 00:59:03,165
no matter what happens,
never ever take your eye off the ball.

776
00:59:06,753 --> 00:59:08,087
All right.

777
00:59:11,425 --> 00:59:15,094
For some reason,
Ping-Pong came very natural to me.

778
00:59:15,429 --> 00:59:18,347
See? Any idiot can play.

779
00:59:18,849 --> 00:59:21,600
So, I started playing it all the time.

780
00:59:22,769 --> 00:59:24,103
I played Ping-Pong

781
00:59:24,187 --> 00:59:27,481
even when I didn't have anyone
to play Ping-Pong with.

782
00:59:35,532 --> 00:59:40,202
The hospital's people said
it made me look like a duck in water,

783
00:59:40,328 --> 00:59:42,163
whatever that means.

784
00:59:42,622 --> 00:59:45,875
Even Lieutenant Dan would come
and watch me play.

785
00:59:51,381 --> 00:59:55,259
I played Ping-Pong so much,
I even played it in my sleep.

786
01:00:03,059 --> 01:00:08,147
Now, you listen to me.
We all have a destiny.

787
01:00:08,231 --> 01:00:11,275
Nothing just happens,
it's all part of a plan.

788
01:00:11,401 --> 01:00:14,069
I should have died out there
with my men,

789
01:00:14,196 --> 01:00:18,157
but now I'm nothing
but a goddamn cripple,

790
01:00:18,241 --> 01:00:21,869
a legless freak! Look! Look! Look at me!

791
01:00:22,621 --> 01:00:23,704
Do you see that?

792
01:00:23,788 --> 01:00:27,583
Do you know what it's like
not to be able to use your legs?

793
01:00:30,921 --> 01:00:32,546
Yes, sir, I do.

794
01:00:36,218 --> 01:00:38,260
Did you hear what I said?

795
01:00:39,137 --> 01:00:40,888
You cheated me.

796
01:00:40,972 --> 01:00:42,139
I had a destiny.

797
01:00:42,224 --> 01:00:45,768
I was supposed to die in the field,
with honor!

798
01:00:46,436 --> 01:00:50,481
That was my destiny,
and you cheated me out of it!

799
01:01:00,116 --> 01:01:02,825
Do you understand
what I'm saying, Gump?

800
01:01:04,954 --> 01:01:08,331
This wasn't supposed to happen,
not to me.

801
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:12,627
I had a destiny.

802
01:01:14,588 --> 01:01:18,967
I was Lieutenant Dan Taylor.

803
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:27,475
You're still Lieutenant Dan.

804
01:01:50,708 --> 01:01:52,208
Look at me.

805
01:01:53,544 --> 01:02:01,217
What am I gonna do now?

806
01:02:11,604 --> 01:02:13,062
PFC Gump?

807
01:02:14,607 --> 01:02:16,024
Yes, sir!

808
01:02:16,692 --> 01:02:18,192
As you were.

809
01:02:18,694 --> 01:02:22,530
Son, you've been awarded
the Medal of Honor.

810
01:02:23,574 --> 01:02:27,201
Guess what, Lieutenant Dan,
they want to give me a...

811
01:02:33,959 --> 01:02:37,712
Ma'am, what'd they do
with Lieutenant Dan?

812
01:02:38,631 --> 01:02:40,423
They sent him home.

813
01:02:46,430 --> 01:02:49,182
FORREST:
Two weeks later, I left Vietnam.

814
01:02:50,225 --> 01:02:53,770
The ceremony was kicked off
with a candid speech by the President

815
01:02:53,854 --> 01:02:57,231
regarding the need for further escalation
of the war in Vietnam.

816
01:02:57,316 --> 01:02:59,442
President Johnson awarded
four Medals of Honor

817
01:02:59,526 --> 01:03:01,194
to men
from each of the Armed Services.

818
01:03:01,278 --> 01:03:04,197
America owes you
a debt of gratitude, son.

819
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:09,994
I understand you were wounded.
Where were you hit?

820
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:13,247
- In the buttocks, sir.
- That must be a sight.

821
01:03:13,999 --> 01:03:16,292
I'd kind of like to see that.

822
01:03:27,721 --> 01:03:29,013
(CHUCKLING)

823
01:03:30,431 --> 01:03:31,890
God damn, son.

824
01:03:34,018 --> 01:03:37,854
After that,
Mama went to the hotel to lay down,

825
01:03:37,939 --> 01:03:41,441
so I went out for a walk
to see our nation's capital.

826
01:03:41,526 --> 01:03:43,068
ISABEL: Hilary, all right,
I've got the vets,

827
01:03:43,152 --> 01:03:44,653
what do you want me to do with them?

828
01:03:44,737 --> 01:03:46,488
HILARY: What are you doing here
so late?

829
01:03:46,572 --> 01:03:50,617
It's a good thing Mama was resting,
'cause the streets was awful crowded

830
01:03:50,702 --> 01:03:53,870
with people looking
at all the statues and monuments,

831
01:03:53,955 --> 01:03:56,581
and some of them people were loud
and pushy.

832
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:59,626
Okay, follow me! Come on.
Let's move it out.

833
01:04:00,461 --> 01:04:03,422
Everywhere I went,
I had to stand in line.

834
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:08,218
HILARY: Follow me, let's go!

835
01:04:10,012 --> 01:04:11,638
Come on. Let's go.

836
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:19,271
Stand here.

837
01:04:21,733 --> 01:04:24,901
Hey, you're a good man
for doing this. Good!

838
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:27,320
Okay.

839
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:31,491
There was this man giving a little talk.

840
01:04:31,576 --> 01:04:35,078
And for some reason, he was
wearing an American flag for a shirt.

841
01:04:35,163 --> 01:04:36,621
ABBIE HOFFMAN: Now, I'm gonna
bring up some soldiers...

842
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:39,499
FORREST:
And he liked to say the "F" word.

843
01:04:39,584 --> 01:04:42,961
A lot. "F" this and "F" that.

844
01:04:43,045 --> 01:04:45,380
And every time he said the "F" word,

845
01:04:45,465 --> 01:04:48,216
people, for some reason,
well, they'd cheer.

846
01:04:48,301 --> 01:04:50,927
...where to stick this fucking war! Yeah!

847
01:04:51,012 --> 01:04:52,012
(CROWD CHEERING)

848
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:54,765
Yeah! Yeah!

849
01:04:55,349 --> 01:04:57,851
Come on, man, come up here, man.

850
01:04:58,269 --> 01:05:01,605
Come on. Come on. Yeah, you!
Come on. Move, move, move.

851
01:05:02,607 --> 01:05:06,026
You can do it. Just get up there.
Go on. That's it.

852
01:05:18,831 --> 01:05:21,374
Tell us a little bit about the war, man.

853
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:23,210
The war in Vietnam?

854
01:05:23,294 --> 01:05:26,213
- The war in Viet-fucking-nam!
- Yeah!

855
01:05:26,297 --> 01:05:27,297
(CROWD CHEERING)

856
01:05:46,567 --> 01:05:47,651
MAN 1: Peace!

857
01:05:48,027 --> 01:05:49,402
MAN 2: Come on, man, go!

858
01:05:49,695 --> 01:05:51,655
MAN 3: Come on!
WOMAN 1: Peace!

859
01:05:51,739 --> 01:05:52,781
Well...

860
01:05:52,865 --> 01:05:56,326
FORREST: There was only one thing
I could say about the war in Vietnam.

861
01:05:56,410 --> 01:06:01,247
...there's only one thing
I can say about the war in Vietnam.

862
01:06:05,043 --> 01:06:08,838
In Vietnam, your...

863
01:06:09,089 --> 01:06:11,465
(SPEAKERS SCREECHING)

864
01:06:18,598 --> 01:06:19,682
MAN 4: Hey, what the hell are you...

865
01:06:19,766 --> 01:06:22,518
I'll beat your head in,
you goddamn oinker!

866
01:06:22,602 --> 01:06:25,104
Jesus Christ, what'd they do with this?

867
01:06:26,523 --> 01:06:28,190
MAN 5: We can't hear you!

868
01:06:29,901 --> 01:06:31,902
MAN 6: We can't hear anything!

869
01:06:32,612 --> 01:06:35,114
- This one! This one! Give me that!
- MAN 7: Turn it up!

870
01:06:35,198 --> 01:06:36,615
WOMAN 2: Speak up!

871
01:06:37,409 --> 01:06:38,868
That's it!

872
01:06:39,953 --> 01:06:42,788
...and that's all I have to say about that.

873
01:06:50,088 --> 01:06:53,048
That's so right on, man. You said it all.

874
01:06:54,551 --> 01:06:57,052
What's your name, man?

875
01:06:57,137 --> 01:06:59,763
My name is Forrest. Forrest Gump.

876
01:07:00,974 --> 01:07:02,141
Forrest Gump!

877
01:07:02,267 --> 01:07:03,642
- Gump!
- Gump!

878
01:07:05,145 --> 01:07:08,898
JENNY: Forrest! Forrest!

879
01:07:12,944 --> 01:07:15,321
- Jenny!
- Forrest!

880
01:07:32,088 --> 01:07:34,757
Hey! Hey!

881
01:07:42,849 --> 01:07:45,976
It was the happiest moment of my life.

882
01:07:48,313 --> 01:07:51,690
Jenny and me were just like
peas and carrots again.

883
01:07:53,026 --> 01:07:54,610
She showed me around,

884
01:07:54,694 --> 01:07:57,279
and even introduced me
to some of her new friends.

885
01:07:57,364 --> 01:07:58,697
Shut that blind, man.

886
01:07:58,823 --> 01:08:01,033
And get your white ass
away from that window.

887
01:08:01,117 --> 01:08:03,202
Don't you know we in a war here?

888
01:08:04,037 --> 01:08:05,454
Hey, man, he's cool. He's cool.
He's one of us.

889
01:08:05,538 --> 01:08:07,456
- Let me tell you about us.
- Where the hell have you been?

890
01:08:07,540 --> 01:08:09,625
Our purpose here
is to protect our black leaders

891
01:08:09,709 --> 01:08:11,460
from the racial onslaught of the pig

892
01:08:11,544 --> 01:08:13,629
who wishes to brutalize
our black leaders,

893
01:08:13,713 --> 01:08:17,049
rape our women,
and destroy our black communities.

894
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:21,887
Who's the baby killer?

895
01:08:22,013 --> 01:08:24,723
This is my good friend I told you about.
This is Forrest Gump.

896
01:08:24,808 --> 01:08:26,557
Forrest, this is Wesley.

897
01:08:26,642 --> 01:08:27,934
Wesley and I lived together in Berkeley,

898
01:08:28,018 --> 01:08:30,645
and he's the president
of the Berkeley chapter of SDS.

899
01:08:30,729 --> 01:08:32,146
Let me tell you something else.

900
01:08:32,231 --> 01:08:36,484
We are here to offer protection and help
for all of those who need our help,

901
01:08:36,568 --> 01:08:40,154
because we, the Black Panthers,
are against the war in Vietnam.

902
01:08:40,239 --> 01:08:43,908
Yes, we are against any war where
black soldiers are sent to the frontline

903
01:08:43,993 --> 01:08:45,910
to die for a country that hates them.

904
01:08:45,995 --> 01:08:49,163
Yes, we are against any war
where black soldiers go to fight

905
01:08:49,248 --> 01:08:52,333
and come to be brutalized and killed
in their own communities

906
01:08:52,418 --> 01:08:54,002
as they sleep in their beds at night.

907
01:08:54,086 --> 01:08:55,253
You are a fucking asshole!

908
01:08:55,337 --> 01:08:58,715
Yes, we are against all these racist
and imperial dog acts.

909
01:09:08,017 --> 01:09:11,227
JENNY: Forrest! Quit it! Quit it!

910
01:09:13,188 --> 01:09:14,439
Forrest!

911
01:09:15,024 --> 01:09:16,774
Stop it! Stop it!

912
01:09:23,407 --> 01:09:24,782
Oh, God...

913
01:09:25,617 --> 01:09:28,036
I shouldn't have brought you here.

914
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:31,748
I should have known it was just
gonna be some bullshit hassle.

915
01:09:32,916 --> 01:09:35,543
He should not be hitting you, Jenny.

916
01:09:40,466 --> 01:09:42,216
Come on, Forrest.

917
01:09:47,931 --> 01:09:51,934
Sorry I had a fight in the middle
of your Black Panther party.

918
01:09:54,813 --> 01:09:57,148
He doesn't mean it when
he does things like this. He doesn't.

919
01:09:57,232 --> 01:09:59,567
I would never hurt you, Jenny.

920
01:10:01,403 --> 01:10:03,654
I know you wouldn't, Forrest.

921
01:10:05,574 --> 01:10:08,159
I wanted to be your boyfriend.

922
01:10:18,670 --> 01:10:21,089
That uniform is a trip, Forrest.

923
01:10:22,466 --> 01:10:25,676
You look handsome in it. You do.

924
01:10:29,765 --> 01:10:31,682
- You know what?
- What?

925
01:10:35,312 --> 01:10:38,940
I'm glad we were here together
in our nation's capital.

926
01:10:40,526 --> 01:10:42,276
Me, too, Forrest.

927
01:10:42,361 --> 01:10:47,031
We walked around all night,
Jenny and me, just talking.

928
01:10:49,118 --> 01:10:52,286
She told me about
all the traveling she'd done.

929
01:10:52,371 --> 01:10:56,957
And how she'd discovered ways
to expand her mind

930
01:10:57,041 --> 01:11:00,127
and learn how to live in harmony,

931
01:11:00,211 --> 01:11:02,546
which must be out west somewhere,

932
01:11:02,630 --> 01:11:04,965
'cause she made it
all the way to California.

933
01:11:05,049 --> 01:11:07,300
(SINGING)
Try to love one another right now

934

HIPPIE: Hey!

935
01:11:09,512 --> 01:11:12,055
Anybody want to go to San Francisco?

936
01:11:12,140 --> 01:11:14,015
- I'll go.
- Far out.

937
01:11:15,476 --> 01:11:18,645
It was a very special night
for the two of us.

938
01:11:20,231 --> 01:11:22,315
I didn't want it to end.

939
01:11:23,109 --> 01:11:25,527
I wish you wouldn't go, Jenny.

940
01:11:26,529 --> 01:11:28,321
I have to, Forrest.

941
01:11:29,323 --> 01:11:30,574
Jenny?

942
01:11:32,743 --> 01:11:35,328
Things got a little out of hand.

943
01:11:35,413 --> 01:11:39,249
It's just this war
and that lying son of a bitch, Johnson!

944
01:11:40,918 --> 01:11:43,712
I would never hurt you, you know that.

945
01:11:46,841 --> 01:11:48,842
You know what I think?

946
01:11:50,344 --> 01:11:55,599
I think you should go home
to Greenbow, Alabama!

947
01:12:06,110 --> 01:12:11,198
Forrest, we have very different lives,
you know.

948
01:12:20,625 --> 01:12:23,793
I want you to have this.

949
01:12:28,466 --> 01:12:30,634
Forrest, I can't keep this.

950
01:12:32,303 --> 01:12:36,556
I got it just by doing
what you told me to do.

951
01:12:38,601 --> 01:12:40,769
Why are you so good to me?

952
01:12:42,271 --> 01:12:43,813
You're my girl.

953
01:12:45,816 --> 01:12:47,943
I'll always be your girl.

954
01:13:28,358 --> 01:13:33,195
FORREST: And just like that,
she was gone, out of my life again.

955
01:13:34,698 --> 01:13:37,032
NEIL ARMSTRONG ON TV:
That's one small step for man,

956
01:13:39,035 --> 01:13:41,870
one giant leap for mankind.

957
01:13:47,544 --> 01:13:50,045
FORREST: I thought I was
going back to Vietnam,

958
01:13:50,171 --> 01:13:53,382
but instead, they decided the best way
for me to fight the Communists

959
01:13:53,466 --> 01:13:55,092
was to play Ping-Pong.

960
01:13:55,176 --> 01:13:57,469
So, I was in the Special Services,

961
01:13:57,554 --> 01:14:00,806
traveling around the country
cheering up all them wounded veterans

962
01:14:00,890 --> 01:14:03,309
and showing them
how to play Ping-Pong.

963
01:14:03,393 --> 01:14:05,311
I was so good that some years later

964
01:14:05,395 --> 01:14:09,023
the Army decided that I should be
on the All-American Ping-Pong team.

965
01:14:09,649 --> 01:14:12,067
We were the first Americans
to visit the land of China

966
01:14:12,152 --> 01:14:14,570
in like a million years,
or something like that.

967
01:14:14,696 --> 01:14:18,115
Somebody said world peace
was in our hands,

968
01:14:18,199 --> 01:14:20,993
but all I did was play Ping-Pong.

969
01:14:21,077 --> 01:14:24,163
When I got home,
I was a national celebrity.

970
01:14:24,873 --> 01:14:27,166
Famouser even than Captain Kangaroo.

971
01:14:27,250 --> 01:14:29,918
Here he is, Forrest Gump, right here.

972
01:14:36,676 --> 01:14:38,427
Mr. Gump, have a seat.

973
01:14:40,930 --> 01:14:43,098
Forrest Gump, John Lennon.

974
01:14:43,767 --> 01:14:45,017
- Welcome home.
- You had quite a trip.

975
01:14:45,101 --> 01:14:48,437
Can you tell us, what was China like?

976
01:14:51,691 --> 01:14:56,945
In the land of China,
people hardly got nothing at all.

977
01:14:57,030 --> 01:14:58,614
No possessions?

978
01:15:01,242 --> 01:15:04,453
And in China, they never go to church.

979
01:15:05,747 --> 01:15:07,289
No religion, too?

980
01:15:07,374 --> 01:15:08,374
Oh.

981
01:15:09,376 --> 01:15:12,669
- Hard to imagine.
- Well, it's easy if you try, Dick.

982
01:15:14,464 --> 01:15:16,840
FORREST: Some years later,
that nice young man from England

983
01:15:16,925 --> 01:15:19,551
was on his way home
to see his little boy

984
01:15:19,636 --> 01:15:22,638
and was signing some autographs,

985
01:15:22,764 --> 01:15:26,725
and for no particular reason at all,
somebody shot him.

986
01:15:29,771 --> 01:15:33,607
They gave you
the Congressional Medal of Honor.

987
01:15:34,901 --> 01:15:36,985
Now, that's Lieutenant Dan.

988
01:15:39,781 --> 01:15:41,407
Lieutenant Dan!

989
01:15:41,491 --> 01:15:45,953
They gave you
the Congressional Medal of Honor!

990
01:15:47,831 --> 01:15:49,331
Yes, sir, they surely did.

991
01:15:49,416 --> 01:15:51,416
They gave you,

992
01:15:51,500 --> 01:15:55,670
an imbecile,
a moron who goes on television

993
01:15:55,754 --> 01:16:00,007
and makes a fool out of himself
in front of the whole damn country,

994
01:16:00,676 --> 01:16:03,177
the Congressional Medal of Honor.

995
01:16:04,346 --> 01:16:05,513
Yes, sir.

996
01:16:07,683 --> 01:16:10,518
Well, then, that's just perfect!

997
01:16:12,438 --> 01:16:14,772
Yeah, well,
I just got one thing to say to that.

998
01:16:14,857 --> 01:16:17,108
God damn bless America.

999
01:16:18,026 --> 01:16:19,318
Hey!

1000
01:16:21,113 --> 01:16:22,447
Oh, God!

1001
01:16:24,950 --> 01:16:27,368
- Oh, God!
- Lieutenant Dan!

1002
01:16:28,495 --> 01:16:31,247
Lieutenant Dan said
he was living in a hotel.

1003
01:16:31,331 --> 01:16:33,291
And because he didn't have no legs,

1004
01:16:33,375 --> 01:16:36,544
he spent most of his time
exercising his arms.

1005
01:16:39,423 --> 01:16:41,883
DAN: Take a right. Take a right.

1006
01:16:44,511 --> 01:16:47,054
CABBIE: Hey! Come on, already!

1007
01:16:47,139 --> 01:16:49,932
What do you do here in New York,
Lieutenant Dan?

1008
01:16:50,017 --> 01:16:52,560
I'm living off the government tit.

1009
01:16:53,061 --> 01:16:54,061
(HORN HONKING)

1010
01:16:54,188 --> 01:16:55,563
Sucking it dry!

1011
01:16:55,647 --> 01:16:57,690
Hey! Hey! Hey! Are you blind?

1012
01:16:57,774 --> 01:16:59,484
- I'm walking here!
- Get out of the way!

1013
01:16:59,568 --> 01:17:02,153
Get out! Come on, go! Go! Go!

1014
01:17:09,203 --> 01:17:12,955
I stayed with Lieutenant Dan
and celebrated the holidays.

1015
01:17:17,377 --> 01:17:20,796
You have a great year.
Hurry home and God bless you.

1016
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:26,594
Have you found Jesus yet, Gump?

1017
01:17:28,180 --> 01:17:30,848
I didn't know I was supposed to be
looking for him, sir.

1018
01:17:30,933 --> 01:17:33,851
(LAUGHING)

1019
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:41,817
That's all these cripples,
down at the VA,

1020
01:17:41,902 --> 01:17:44,320
that's all they ever talk about.

1021
01:17:45,489 --> 01:17:48,449
Jesus this and Jesus that.

1022
01:17:49,910 --> 01:17:52,203
Have I found Jesus?

1023
01:17:52,829 --> 01:17:55,831
They even had a priest come
and talk to me.

1024
01:17:56,708 --> 01:18:01,379
He said God is listening,
but I have to help myself.

1025
01:18:02,756 --> 01:18:05,049
How if I accept Jesus into my heart,

1026
01:18:06,051 --> 01:18:09,845
I'll get to walk beside him
in the kingdom of heaven.

1027
01:18:09,930 --> 01:18:12,098
Did you hear what I said?

1028
01:18:13,141 --> 01:18:17,144
Walk beside him
in the kingdom of heaven.

1029
01:18:17,229 --> 01:18:20,188
Well, kiss my crippled ass.

1030
01:18:20,273 --> 01:18:23,650
God is listening? What a crock of shit.

1031
01:18:27,321 --> 01:18:29,948
I'm going to heaven, Lieutenant Dan.

1032
01:18:31,867 --> 01:18:32,909
Oh?

1033
01:18:37,748 --> 01:18:39,124
Well,

1034
01:18:42,086 --> 01:18:45,463
before you go, why don't you get
your ass down to the corner

1035
01:18:45,548 --> 01:18:48,049
- and get us another bottle of Ripple.
- Yes, sir.

1036
01:18:48,134 --> 01:18:53,263
We are at approximately 45th Street
in New York City at One Astor Plaza.

1037
01:18:53,347 --> 01:18:55,181
This is the site of the old Astor Hotel.

1038
01:18:55,266 --> 01:18:57,475
DAN: What the hell
is in Bayou La Batre?

1039
01:18:57,560 --> 01:18:59,894
FORREST: Shrimping boats.
DAN: Shrimping boats?

1040
01:18:59,979 --> 01:19:02,397
Who gives a shit
about shrimping boats?

1041
01:19:02,481 --> 01:19:03,940
FORREST: I gotta buy me
one of them shrimping boats,

1042
01:19:04,025 --> 01:19:05,567
soon as I have some money.

1043
01:19:05,651 --> 01:19:08,486
I made me a promise to Bubba
in Vietnam

1044
01:19:08,571 --> 01:19:11,281
that as soon as the war was over,
we'd go in partners.

1045
01:19:11,365 --> 01:19:14,784
He'd be the captain of the
shrimping boat and I'd be his first mate.

1046
01:19:14,869 --> 01:19:18,330
But now that he's dead,
that means I gotta be the captain.

1047
01:19:18,414 --> 01:19:21,124
- A shrimp boat captain.
- Yes, sir.

1048
01:19:21,208 --> 01:19:23,668
A promise is a promise, Lieutenant Dan.

1049
01:19:23,753 --> 01:19:25,170
(LAUGHING)

1050
01:19:25,463 --> 01:19:27,922
Now hear this!

1051
01:19:28,674 --> 01:19:32,510
Private Gump here
is gonna be a shrimp boat captain.

1052
01:19:33,262 --> 01:19:34,679
Well, I tell you what, Gilligan,

1053
01:19:34,764 --> 01:19:37,223
the day that you are
a shrimp boat captain,

1054
01:19:37,308 --> 01:19:40,852
- I will come and be your first mate.
- Okay.

1055
01:19:40,936 --> 01:19:45,273
If you're ever a shrimp boat captain,
that's the day I'm an astronaut.

1056
01:19:45,358 --> 01:19:48,360
LENORE: Danny, what are you
complaining about?

1057
01:19:48,444 --> 01:19:51,029
- What are you doing, hon?
- Mr. Hot Wheels.

1058
01:19:51,113 --> 01:19:54,741
- Who's your friend?
- My name is Forrest, Forrest Gump.

1059
01:19:55,576 --> 01:19:59,788
This is Cunning Carla
and Long-Limbs Lenore.

1060
01:20:00,873 --> 01:20:04,084
So, where you been, baby cakes, huh?
Haven't seen you around lately.

1061
01:20:04,168 --> 01:20:05,627
You know, you should have
been here for Christmas,

1062
01:20:05,711 --> 01:20:07,045
'cause Tommy bought a round
on the house

1063
01:20:07,129 --> 01:20:08,630
and gave everybody a turkey sandwich.

1064
01:20:08,714 --> 01:20:11,758
Well, well, I had company.

1065
01:20:12,635 --> 01:20:16,304
Hey, hey! We was just there.
That's at Times Square.

1066
01:20:16,931 --> 01:20:21,059
Don't you just love New Year's?
You get to start all over.

FORREST: It's funny,
but in the middle of all that fun,

1069
01:20:27,149 --> 01:20:29,442
I began to think about Jenny,

1070
01:20:30,361 --> 01:20:34,823
wondering how she was spending
her New Year's night out in California.

Happy New Year, Lieutenant Dan!

01:22:01,785 --> 01:22:05,454
What are you, stupid or something?
What's your problem?

1078
01:22:06,122 --> 01:22:07,539
What's his problem?

1079
01:22:07,624 --> 01:22:09,875
Did you lose your pecker in the war
or something?

01:22:09,959 --> 01:22:12,002
What, is your friend stupid
or something?

1081
01:22:12,086 --> 01:22:13,170
What did you say?

1082
01:22:13,254 --> 01:22:14,671
I said, is your friend stupid
or something?

1083
01:22:14,756 --> 01:22:16,924
Hey! Don't call him stupid!

- CARLA: What's the matter, baby?

- Why are you so upset?
- DAN: Just get the hell out of here.

Go on! Get out of here!

1091
01:22:28,812 --> 01:22:30,103
Come on, Lenore.
We don't need this shit!

1092
01:22:30,188 --> 01:22:31,563
Get out of here!

1093
01:22:31,731 --> 01:22:33,106
(LAUGHING)

1094
01:22:33,191 --> 01:22:35,734
- You retard.
- Loser. You freak.

1095
01:22:41,115 --> 01:22:42,324
No, no.

1096
01:23:07,475 --> 01:23:11,436
I'm sorry I ruined your
New Year's Eve party, Lieutenant Dan.

1097
01:23:12,021 --> 01:23:14,314
She tasted like cigarettes.

1098
01:23:30,497 --> 01:23:32,039
FORREST:
I guess Lieutenant Dan figured

1099
01:23:32,124 --> 01:23:34,959
there's some things
you just can't change.

1100
01:23:35,085 --> 01:23:40,214
He didn't want to be called crippled,
just like I didn't want to be called stupid.

1101
01:23:45,721 --> 01:23:47,597
Happy New Year, Gump.

1102
01:23:52,394 --> 01:23:53,769
The US Ping-Pong team

1103
01:23:53,854 --> 01:23:56,147
met with President Nixon today
at an Oval Office ceremony...

1104
01:23:56,231 --> 01:23:58,983
And wouldn't you know it?
A few months later,

1105
01:23:59,067 --> 01:24:03,029
they invited me and the Ping-Pong team
to visit the White House.

1106
01:24:03,113 --> 01:24:05,364
So, I went, again.

1107
01:24:06,199 --> 01:24:09,660
And I met the President
of the United States, again.

1108
01:24:10,412 --> 01:24:13,372
Only, this time, they didn't get us rooms
in a real fancy hotel.

1109
01:24:13,457 --> 01:24:16,834
So, are you enjoying yourself
in our nation's capital, young man?

1110
01:24:16,919 --> 01:24:19,921
- Yes, sir.
- Well, where are you staying?

1111
01:24:20,005 --> 01:24:22,632
- It's called the Hotel Ebbott.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

1112
01:24:22,716 --> 01:24:25,843
I know of a much nicer hotel.
It's brand-new, very modern.

1113
01:24:25,928 --> 01:24:27,929
I'll have my people
take care of it for you.

1114
01:24:28,555 --> 01:24:29,680
Security, Frank Wills.

1115
01:24:29,765 --> 01:24:33,351
Yeah, sir, you might want
to send a maintenance man

1116
01:24:33,435 --> 01:24:36,103
over to that office across the way.

1117
01:24:36,188 --> 01:24:39,065
The lights are off, and they must be
looking for a fuse box or something,

1118
01:24:39,149 --> 01:24:41,859
'cause them flashlights,
they're keeping me awake.

1119
01:24:41,944 --> 01:24:43,569
Okay, sir. I'll check it out.

1120
01:24:43,654 --> 01:24:45,363
- Thank you.
- No problem.

1121
01:24:45,447 --> 01:24:47,365
- Good night.
- Good night.

1122
01:24:50,994 --> 01:24:56,374
Therefore, I shall resign the presidency
effective at noon tomorrow.

1123
01:24:56,458 --> 01:24:58,501
Vice President Ford

1124
01:24:58,585 --> 01:25:03,089
will be sworn in as president
at that hour in this office.

1125
01:25:04,466 --> 01:25:09,261
As I recall the high hopes for America
with which we began this second term...

1126
01:25:14,518 --> 01:25:16,060
Sergeant Gump.

1127
01:25:16,561 --> 01:25:18,771
- Yes, sir!
- As you were.

1128
01:25:18,855 --> 01:25:21,983
I have your discharge papers.
Your service is up, son.

1129
01:25:25,404 --> 01:25:28,155
Does this mean
I can't play Ping-Pong no more?

1130
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:30,199
For the Army it does.

1131
01:25:32,828 --> 01:25:37,707
FORREST: And just like that, my service
in the United States Army was over.

1132
01:25:43,005 --> 01:25:44,796
So, I went home.

1133
01:26:06,277 --> 01:26:09,696
- I'm home, Mama.
- I know, I know.

1134
01:26:11,323 --> 01:26:12,866
- Louise, he's here.
- FORREST: Now, when I got home,

1135
01:26:12,950 --> 01:26:16,995
I had no idea,
but Mama had had all sorts of visitors.

1136
01:26:17,121 --> 01:26:19,414
We've had all sorts of visitors, Forrest.

1137
01:26:19,498 --> 01:26:22,584
Everybody wants you
to use their Ping-Pong stuff.

1138
01:26:22,668 --> 01:26:26,463
One man even left a check for $25,000

1139
01:26:26,547 --> 01:26:30,008
if you'd be agreeable to saying
you liked using their paddle.

1140
01:26:30,134 --> 01:26:32,802
Oh, but, Mama,
I only like using my own paddle.

1141
01:26:32,887 --> 01:26:34,888
- Hi, Miss Louise.
- Hey, Forrest.

1142
01:26:34,972 --> 01:26:37,891
I know that. I know that.

1143
01:26:37,975 --> 01:26:40,643
But it's $25,000, Forrest.

1144
01:26:40,728 --> 01:26:45,398
I thought maybe you could hold it
for a while, see if it grows on you.

1145
01:26:45,483 --> 01:26:47,609
- Oh, you look good, Forrest.
- That Mama, she sure was right.

1146
01:26:47,693 --> 01:26:50,195
- You look real good.
- It's funny how things work out.

1147
01:26:50,321 --> 01:26:53,448
I didn't stay home for long,
because I'd made a promise to Bubba,

1148
01:26:53,532 --> 01:26:55,784
and I always try to keep my promise.

1149
01:26:55,868 --> 01:26:57,410
So, I went on down to Bayou La Batre

1150
01:26:57,495 --> 01:27:01,247
to meet Bubba's family
and make their introduction.

1151
01:27:01,332 --> 01:27:05,001
Are you crazy, orjust plain stupid?

1152
01:27:05,711 --> 01:27:07,962
Stupid is as stupid does, Mrs. Blue.

1153
01:27:08,047 --> 01:27:09,422
I guess.

1154
01:27:10,424 --> 01:27:14,010
And, of course,
I paid my respect to Bubba himself.

1155
01:27:16,013 --> 01:27:18,556
Hey, Bubba, it's me, Forrest Gump.

1156
01:27:21,685 --> 01:27:25,730
I remember everything you said,
and I got it all figured out.

1157
01:27:28,526 --> 01:27:35,323
I'm taking the $24,562
and 47 cents that I got...

1158
01:27:36,408 --> 01:27:39,994
Or, that's left after a new hair cut
and a new suit,

1159
01:27:40,079 --> 01:27:42,038
and I took Mama out
to a real fancy dinner,

1160
01:27:42,123 --> 01:27:45,375
and I bought a bus ticket
and three Dr. Peppers.

1161
01:27:45,918 --> 01:27:47,710
Tell me something.

1162
01:27:48,754 --> 01:27:50,880
SHRIMPER: Are you stupid
or something?

1163
01:27:50,965 --> 01:27:53,007
Stupid is as stupid does, sir.

1164
01:27:53,092 --> 01:27:56,052
Well, that's what's left after me saying,

1165
01:27:56,971 --> 01:27:59,097
"When I was in China
on the All-America Ping-Pong team,

1166
01:27:59,223 --> 01:28:03,017
"I just loved playing Ping-Pong with
my Flex-O-Light Ping-Pong paddle,"

1167
01:28:03,102 --> 01:28:04,352
which everybody knows isn't true,

1168
01:28:04,436 --> 01:28:05,812
but Mama says it's just a little white lie

1169
01:28:05,896 --> 01:28:08,064
so it wouldn't hurt nobody.

1170
01:28:09,483 --> 01:28:15,404
So, anyway, I'm putting all that on gas,
ropes and new nets

1171
01:28:16,156 --> 01:28:17,906
and a brand-new shrimping boat.

1172
01:28:39,596 --> 01:28:42,848
Now, Bubba had told me everything
he knew about shrimping,

1173
01:28:42,932 --> 01:28:45,267
but you know what I found out?

1174
01:28:46,936 --> 01:28:49,271
Shrimping is tough.

1175
01:28:51,482 --> 01:28:53,317
I only caught five.

1176
01:28:53,443 --> 01:28:55,277
A couple more,
you could have yourself a cocktail.

1178
01:29:00,116 --> 01:29:01,867
Hey, you ever think
about naming this old boat?

1179
01:29:01,951 --> 01:29:04,620
It's bad luck
to have a boat without a name.

1180
01:29:06,998 --> 01:29:11,835
I'd never named a boat before,
but there was only one I could think of,

1181
01:29:13,004 --> 01:29:16,215
the most beautiful name
in the wide world.

Now, I hadn't heard from Jenny
in a long while,

1184
01:29:40,156 --> 01:29:42,699
but I thought about her a lot,

1185
01:29:42,825 --> 01:29:46,286
and I hoped that whatever
she was doing made her happy.

1186
01:31:32,559 --> 01:31:35,102
I thought about Jenny all the time.

Hey!

1189
01:32:24,778 --> 01:32:29,448
Lieutenant Dan,
what are you doing here?

1190
01:32:29,533 --> 01:32:33,452
Well, thought I'd try out my sea legs.

1191
01:32:33,537 --> 01:32:37,289
But you ain't got no legs,
Lieutenant Dan.

1192
01:32:37,374 --> 01:32:39,667
Yes, I know that.

1193
01:32:40,001 --> 01:32:42,044
You wrote me a letter, you idiot.

1194
01:32:42,170 --> 01:32:46,715
Well, well. Captain Forrest Gump.
I had to see this for myself.

1195

And I told you if you were ever
a shrimp boat captain

1196
01:32:55,350 --> 01:32:57,935
that I'd be your first mate.
Well, here I am.

01:32:58,019 --> 01:33:01,147
- I am a man of my word.
- Okay.

1198
01:33:01,231 --> 01:33:05,234
Yeah, but don't you be thinking that
I'm going to be calling you "sir."

No, sir.

due east, we'll find some shrimp,

so take a left.

1203
01:33:29,049 --> 01:33:31,968
- Take a left!
- Which way?

1204
01:33:32,052 --> 01:33:34,721
Over there! They're over there!

1205
01:33:35,389 --> 01:33:39,225
- Get on the wheel and take a left!
- Okay.

Gump, what are you doing?
Take a left! Left!

How are we going to find them?

came through here yesterday,

destroying nearly everything in its path.

01:36:09,375 --> 01:36:12,836
in fact, only one shrimping boat
actually survived the storm.

a big old warehouse. We even have
hats that say "Bubba-Gump" on them.

1240
01:36:43,576 --> 01:36:46,870
Bubba-Gump Shrimp.
It's a household name.

1241
01:36:47,080 --> 01:36:48,789
Hold on there, boy.

1242
01:36:48,915 --> 01:36:53,460
Are you telling me you're the owner of
the Bubba-Gump Shrimp Corporation?

1243
01:36:53,586 --> 01:36:56,588
Yes, sir. We got more money
than Davy Crockett.

1244
01:36:56,673 --> 01:36:58,131
(LAUGHING)

1245
01:36:58,216 --> 01:37:02,260
Boy, I heard some whoppers in my time,
but that tops them all.

1246
01:37:04,972 --> 01:37:07,766
We was sitting next to a millionaire.

1247
01:37:11,270 --> 01:37:15,899
Well, I thought it was a very lovely story,

1248
01:37:16,317 --> 01:37:20,946
and you tell it so well,
with such enthusiasm.

1249
01:37:22,657 --> 01:37:25,325
Would you like to see
what Lieutenant Dan looks like?

1250
01:37:25,451 --> 01:37:26,952
Well, yes, I would.

1251
01:37:31,958 --> 01:37:34,000
That's him right there.

1252
01:37:36,337 --> 01:37:38,588
And let me tell you something
about Lieutenant Dan...

1253
01:37:39,757 --> 01:37:40,799
Forrest,

1254
01:37:46,347 --> 01:37:49,141
I never thanked you for saving my life.

1255
01:38:15,167 --> 01:38:21,464
FORREST: He never actually said so,
but I think he made his peace with God.

1256
01:38:27,345 --> 01:38:28,846
(GUNSHOTS FIRING)

1257
01:38:29,139 --> 01:38:31,348
For the second time in 17 days,

1258
01:38:31,475 --> 01:38:34,935
President Ford escaped
possible assassination today.

1259

MARGO: Base to Jenny 1.

1260
01:38:36,396 --> 01:38:39,899
- Base to Jenny 1.
- Jenny 1. Go, Margo.

1261
01:38:39,983 --> 01:38:41,484
Forrest has a phone call.

1262
01:38:41,568 --> 01:38:44,069
Yeah, well, you'll have to tell them
to call him back.

1263
01:38:44,154 --> 01:38:47,531
- He is indisposed at the moment.
- His mama's sick.

1264
01:39:08,220 --> 01:39:10,596
- Where's Mama?
- She's upstairs.

1265
01:39:13,433 --> 01:39:15,392
Hi, Forrest.

1266
01:39:16,353 --> 01:39:18,896
- DOCTOR: I'll see you tomorrow.
- All right.

1267
01:39:25,570 --> 01:39:28,739
We sure got you straightened out,
didn't we, boy?

1268
01:39:40,085 --> 01:39:44,046
- What's the matter, Mama?
- I'm dying, Forrest.

1269
01:39:47,384 --> 01:39:49,760
Come on in, sit down over here.

1270
01:40:04,109 --> 01:40:07,611
- Why are you dying, Mama?
- It's my time.

1271
01:40:08,613 --> 01:40:10,489
It's just my time.

1272
01:40:11,950 --> 01:40:16,120
Now, don't you be afraid, sweetheart.

1273
01:40:17,747 --> 01:40:20,124
Death is just a part of life,

1274
01:40:21,126 --> 01:40:23,752
something we're all destined to do.

1275
01:40:25,589 --> 01:40:29,967
I didn't know it,
but I was destined to be your mama.

1276
01:40:30,802 --> 01:40:34,387
- I did the best I could.
- You did good, Mama.

1277
01:40:35,180 --> 01:40:40,351
Well, I happen to believe
you make your own destiny.

1278
01:40:41,854 --> 01:40:45,106
You have to do the best
with what God gave you.

1279
01:40:48,986 --> 01:40:51,112
What's my destiny, Mama?

1280
01:40:53,282 --> 01:40:56,492
You're going to have
to figure that out for yourself.

1281
01:40:57,786 --> 01:41:00,747
Life is a box of chocolates, Forrest.

1282
01:41:00,831 --> 01:41:02,999
You never know
what you're going to get.

1283
01:41:03,125 --> 01:41:07,503
Mama always had a way of explaining
things so I could understand them.

1284
01:41:07,588 --> 01:41:09,797
I will miss you, Forrest.

1285
01:41:11,634 --> 01:41:15,678
She had got the cancer
and died on a Tuesday.

1286
01:41:17,181 --> 01:41:20,516
I bought her a new hat
with little flowers on it.

1287
01:41:23,562 --> 01:41:26,856
And that's all I have to say about that.

1288
01:41:33,697 --> 01:41:35,990
Didn't you say you were waiting
for the number seven bus?

1289
01:41:36,075 --> 01:41:38,868
There'll be another one along shortly.

1290
01:41:42,706 --> 01:41:46,292
Now, because I had been a football star,
and a war hero,

1291
01:41:46,377 --> 01:41:49,504
and a national celebrity,
and a shrimping boat captain,

1292
01:41:50,005 --> 01:41:53,216
and a college graduate,
the city fathers of Greenbow, Alabama

1293
01:41:53,342 --> 01:41:56,552
decided to get together
and offered me a fine job.

1294
01:41:57,930 --> 01:42:01,599
So, I never went back to work
for Lieutenant Dan,

1295
01:42:01,725 --> 01:42:04,435
though he did take care
of my Bubba-Gump money.

1296
01:42:04,561 --> 01:42:09,148
He got me invested
in some kind of fruit company.

1297
01:42:09,233 --> 01:42:10,817
And so then, I got a call from him saying

1298
01:42:10,901 --> 01:42:14,362
we don't have to worry about money
no more, and I said,

1299
01:42:14,446 --> 01:42:16,739
"That's good. One less thing."

1300
01:42:17,241 --> 01:42:19,367
(SINGING GOSPEL MUSIC)

1301
01:42:19,785 --> 01:42:23,705
Now, Mama said there's only
so much fortune a man really needs,

1302
01:42:24,456 --> 01:42:27,291
and the rest is just for showing off.

1303
01:42:27,376 --> 01:42:31,254
So, I gave a whole bunch of it
to the Foursquare gospel church,

1304
01:42:33,716 --> 01:42:37,885
and I gave a whole bunch to the
Bayou La Batre fishing hospital.

1305
01:42:40,764 --> 01:42:45,309
And even though Bubba was dead
and Lieutenant Dan said I was nuts,

1306
01:42:45,436 --> 01:42:48,062
I gave Bubba's mama Bubba's share.

1307
01:42:52,276 --> 01:42:53,985
You know what?

1308
01:42:55,237 --> 01:42:58,239
She didn't have to work
in nobody's kitchen no more.

1309
01:42:58,323 --> 01:42:59,949
That smells wonderful.

1310
01:43:00,784 --> 01:43:04,703
And 'cause I was a gazillionaire
and I liked doing it so much,

1311
01:43:04,787 --> 01:43:07,122
I cut that grass for free.

1312
01:43:10,918 --> 01:43:13,795
But at night time
when there was nothing to do

1313
01:43:13,880 --> 01:43:16,256
and the house was all empty,

1314
01:43:17,258 --> 01:43:19,634
I'd always think of Jenny.

1315
01:44:23,324 --> 01:44:26,493
And then, she was there.

1316
01:44:59,485 --> 01:45:02,654
- Hello, Forrest.
- Hello, Jenny.

1317
01:45:14,208 --> 01:45:16,835
Jenny came back and stayed with me.

1318
01:45:18,421 --> 01:45:22,090
Maybe it was because
she had nowhere else to go,

1319
01:45:22,216 --> 01:45:25,927
or maybe it was because she was
so tired, 'cause she went to bed

1320
01:45:26,053 --> 01:45:30,015
and slept and slept,
like she hadn't slept in years.

1321
01:45:31,266 --> 01:45:33,559
It was wonderful having her home.

1322
01:45:34,895 --> 01:45:40,024
Every day we'd take a walk and
I'd jabber on like a monkey in a tree,

1323
01:45:40,108 --> 01:45:42,651
and she'd listen about Ping-Ponging,
and shrimping,

1324
01:45:42,736 --> 01:45:47,031
and Mama making a trip up to heaven.
I did all the talking.

1325
01:45:47,115 --> 01:45:50,451
Jenny most of the time was real quiet.

1326
01:46:30,617 --> 01:46:33,827
How could you do this?

1327
01:46:47,133 --> 01:46:49,134
(CRYING)

1328
01:47:10,782 --> 01:47:14,118
Sometimes I guess there
just aren't enough rocks.

1329
01:47:16,329 --> 01:47:20,833
I never really knew why she came back,
but I didn't care.

1330
01:47:21,001 --> 01:47:25,296
It was like olden times.
We was like peas and carrots again.

1331
01:47:27,382 --> 01:47:31,719
Every day, I'd pick pretty flowers
and put them in her room for her,

1332
01:47:33,221 --> 01:47:36,807
and she gave me the best gift anyone
could ever get in the wide world.

1333
01:47:36,891 --> 01:47:39,727
- New shoes.
- They make them just for running.

1334
01:47:44,733 --> 01:47:48,027
And she even showed me how to dance.

1335
01:47:56,202 --> 01:48:00,413
And, well, we was like family,
Jenny and me.

1336
01:48:04,168 --> 01:48:07,086
And it was the happiest time in my life.

You would, Forrest.

1345

But you won't marry me.

01:49:07,773 --> 01:49:09,982
You don't want to marry me.

- I'm not running.

That day, for no particular reason,
I decided to go for a little run.

1354
01:52:44,864 --> 01:52:49,284
So, I ran to the end of the road,
and when I got there,

1355
01:52:49,368 --> 01:52:51,119
I thought maybe I'd run

1359

I thought maybe I'd just
run across Greenbow County.

1360
01:53:00,545 --> 01:53:02,963
And I figured since I'd run this far,

1361
01:53:03,048 --> 01:53:06,300
maybe I'd just run across
the great state of Alabama.

1362
01:53:06,384 --> 01:53:07,593
And that's what I did.

1363
01:53:08,219 --> 01:53:10,804
I ran clear across Alabama.

1364
01:53:11,056 --> 01:53:14,224
For no particular reason,
I just kept on going.

1365
01:53:15,560 --> 01:53:17,144
I ran clear to the ocean.

1366
01:53:23,026 --> 01:53:26,195
And when I got there,
I figured since I'd gone this far,

1367
01:53:26,738 --> 01:53:29,573
might as well turn around
and just keep on going.

And when I got to another ocean,
I figured since I'd gone this far,

I might as well just turn back
and keep right on going.

When I got tired, I slept.
When I got hungry, I ate.

When I had to go, you know...

1372
01:53:54,182 --> 01:53:55,349
I went.

- Sir, why are you running?

01:55:16,097 --> 01:55:17,431
Are you doing this for the homeless?

1390
01:55:17,515 --> 01:55:20,517
- Are you running for women's rights?
- Or for the environment?

1391
01:55:20,602 --> 01:55:21,602
Or for animals?

1392
01:55:21,686 --> 01:55:24,604
FORREST: They just couldn't believe
that somebody would do all that running

1393
01:55:24,688 --> 01:55:26,063
for no particular reason.

1394
01:55:26,148 --> 01:55:28,107
REPORTER: Why are you doing this?

1395
01:55:28,192 --> 01:55:33,196
I just felt like running.

1396
01:55:33,322 --> 01:55:36,532
It's you. I can't believe it's really you.

1397
01:55:37,367 --> 01:55:42,497
Now, for some reason, what I was doing
seemed to make sense to people.

1398
01:55:42,664 --> 01:55:44,791
I mean, it was like an alarm
went off in my head, you know?

1399
01:55:44,875 --> 01:55:46,709
I said,
"Here's a guy that's got his act together.

1400
01:55:46,835 --> 01:55:48,795
"Here's somebody
who's got it all figured out.

1401
01:55:48,879 --> 01:55:52,965
"Here's somebody who has the answer."
I'll follow you anywhere, Mr. Gump.

1402
01:55:53,050 --> 01:55:54,884
So, I got company.

1403
01:55:56,720 --> 01:56:02,558
And after that, I got more company.
And then, even more people joined in.

1404
01:56:05,020 --> 01:56:08,231
Somebody later told me
it gave people hope.

1405
01:56:10,025 --> 01:56:13,402
Now... Now, I don't know
anything about that,

1406
01:56:14,238 --> 01:56:16,823
but some of those people
asked me if I could help them out.

1407
01:56:17,032 --> 01:56:20,284
Hey, man, hey, listen, I was wondering
if you might help me, huh?

1408
01:56:20,369 --> 01:56:22,119
Listen, I'm in the
bumper sticker business

1409
01:56:22,204 --> 01:56:23,955
and I've been trying
to think up a good slogan.

1410
01:56:24,039 --> 01:56:27,166
And since you have been such a big
inspiration to the people around here,

1411
01:56:27,251 --> 01:56:29,168
I thought you might
be able to help me jump into...

1412
01:56:29,253 --> 01:56:32,880
Whoa, man! You just ran through
a big pile of dog shit!

1413
01:56:34,424 --> 01:56:37,093
- It happens.
- What, shit?

1414
01:56:38,595 --> 01:56:40,555
Sometimes.

1415
01:56:42,432 --> 01:56:45,101
And some years later,
I heard that that fellow

1416
01:56:45,185 --> 01:56:47,019
did come up with
a bumper sticker slogan,

1417
01:56:47,104 --> 01:56:50,106
and he made a lot of money off of it.

1418
01:56:51,567 --> 01:56:53,776
Another time, I was running along,

1419
01:56:53,902 --> 01:56:57,196
somebody who had lost all his money
in the T-shirt business,

1420
01:56:57,281 --> 01:56:59,323
he wanted to put my face on a T-shirt,

1421
01:56:59,408 --> 01:57:02,368
but he couldn't draw that well,
and he didn't have a camera.

1422
01:57:02,452 --> 01:57:05,955
Here, use this one.
Nobody likes that color anyway.

1423
01:57:10,794 --> 01:57:12,461
FORREST: Have a nice day.

1424
01:57:14,089 --> 01:57:15,214
Well, some years later,

1425
01:57:15,299 --> 01:57:19,218
I found out that that man
did come up with an idea for a T-shirt.

1426
01:57:19,303 --> 01:57:21,679
He made a lot of money off of it.

1427
01:57:24,474 --> 01:57:28,895
Anyway, like I was saying,
I had a lot of company.

1428
01:57:30,147 --> 01:57:31,314
My mama always said,

1429
01:57:31,398 --> 01:57:35,818
"You got to put the past behind you
before you can move on."

1430
01:57:37,487 --> 01:57:40,823
And I think that's what
my running was all about.

1431
01:57:41,658 --> 01:57:45,661
I had run for three years, two months,

1432
01:57:45,913 --> 01:57:48,247
14 days and 16 hours.

1433
01:58:03,930 --> 01:58:06,264
Quiet. Quiet.
He's going to say something.

1434
01:58:17,693 --> 01:58:19,444
I'm pretty tired.

1435
01:58:22,281 --> 01:58:24,324
Think I'll go home now.

1436
01:58:42,885 --> 01:58:45,345
Now what are we supposed to do?

1437
01:58:46,305 --> 01:58:50,558
And just like that,
my running days was over.

1438
01:58:52,520 --> 01:58:54,270
So, I went home to Alabama.

1439
01:58:55,064 --> 01:58:58,942
REPORTER: Moments ago, at 2:25 p.m.,
as President Reagan was leaving the...

1440
01:58:59,026 --> 01:59:00,694
(GUNSHOTS FIRING)

1441
01:59:00,987 --> 01:59:05,156
...five or six gunshots were fired
by an unknown would-be assassin.

1442
01:59:05,658 --> 01:59:07,993
The President was shot in the chest,
and the assailant...

1443
01:59:08,077 --> 01:59:10,036
I picked up the mail.

1444
01:59:10,830 --> 01:59:14,666
And one day, out of the blue clear sky,
I got a letter from Jenny,

1445
01:59:14,750 --> 01:59:19,004
wondering if I could come down
to Savannah and see her,

1446
01:59:19,088 --> 01:59:21,673
and that's what I'm doing here.

1447
01:59:21,757 --> 01:59:24,342
She saw me on TV, running.

1448
01:59:24,427 --> 01:59:28,680
I'm supposed to go on the
number nine bus to Richmond Street

1449
01:59:28,764 --> 01:59:35,687
and get off and go one block left
to 1947 Henry Street, Apartment 4.

1450
01:59:35,771 --> 01:59:39,441
Why, you don't need to take a bus.

1451
01:59:39,567 --> 01:59:44,112
Henry Street is just five
or six blocks down that way.

1452
01:59:45,948 --> 01:59:48,283
- Down that way?
- Down that way.

1453
01:59:51,287 --> 01:59:53,204
It was nice talking to you.

(CAR HORN HONKING)

1455
01:59:54,498 --> 01:59:57,125
I hope everything works out for you!

1456
02:00:04,633 --> 02:00:06,301
Hey!

1457
02:00:06,719 --> 02:00:08,386
Forrest!

1458
02:00:08,637 --> 02:00:11,890
How you doing? Come in, come in!

1459
02:00:11,974 --> 02:00:13,183
I got your letter.

1460
02:00:13,267 --> 02:00:15,894
I was wondering about that.

1461
02:00:17,438 --> 02:00:19,230
Is this your house?

1462
02:00:19,315 --> 02:00:22,399
Yeah. It's messy right now.
I just got off work.

1463
02:00:22,484 --> 02:00:26,195
It's nice. You got air conditioning.

1464
02:00:33,078 --> 02:00:35,120
- Thank you.
- I ate some.

1465
02:00:37,916 --> 02:00:43,337
Hey, I kept a scrapbook
of your clippings and everything.

1466
02:00:43,463 --> 02:00:45,089
There you are.

1467
02:00:46,674 --> 02:00:48,050
And this, I got you running.

1468
02:00:51,012 --> 02:00:53,180
I ran a long way,

02:00:53,681 --> 02:00:55,516
for a long time.

1470
02:00:57,727 --> 02:00:59,228
And there...

1471
02:01:05,735 --> 02:01:09,196
Listen, Forrest,
I don't know how to say this.

1472
02:01:11,699 --> 02:01:16,036
I just I want to apologize
for anything that I ever did to you,

changes, so I'll be able to... But thanks...

1480
02:01:34,430 --> 02:01:36,473
No problem. Got to go, Jen,
I'm double-parked.

02:01:36,558 --> 02:01:38,433
- Okay. Thanks.
- Bye.

This is my very good friend, Mr. Gump.
Can you say hi to him?

- Hello, Mr. Gump.
- Hello.

02:01:47,902 --> 02:01:50,904
- Can I go watch TV now?
- Yes, you can. Just keep it low.

1485

- You're a mama, Jenny.
- I'm a mama.

1486
02:01:59,956 --> 02:02:01,790

I named him after his daddy.

1489

He got a daddy named Forrest, too?

You're his daddy, Forrest.

You didn't do anything wrong.

Okay?

Isn't he beautiful?

1496
02:02:50,339 --> 02:02:53,299
He's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

Is he smart, or...

He's very smart.
He's one of the smartest in his class.

Yeah, it's okay. Go talk to him.

What, do you have
a cough due to a cold?

1505
02:04:07,082 --> 02:04:09,458
I have some kind of virus,

1506
02:04:09,543 --> 02:04:12,253
and the doctors don't...
They don't know what it is,

1507

and there isn't anything
they can do about it.

Hello, Forrest.

You got new legs. New legs!

1520
02:05:58,484 --> 02:06:02,278
Yeah. I got new legs. Custom-made.

1521
02:06:02,988 --> 02:06:06,991
Titanium alloy.
It's what they use on the space shuttle.

Magic legs.

Hey. It's nice to meet you finally.

take Jenny to be your wife?

1528
02:06:49,743 --> 02:06:53,997
Do you, Jenny,
take Forrest to be your husband?

1529
02:06:55,332 --> 02:06:58,710
And so I pronounce you man and wife.

Were you scared in Vietnam?

Yes. Well, I...

I don't know.

1535
02:08:01,814 --> 02:08:06,777
Sometimes it would stop raining long
enough for the stars to come out.

1536
02:08:09,906 --> 02:08:11,949
And then it was nice.

1537
02:08:15,328 --> 02:08:19,289
It was like just before the sun
goes to bed down on the bayou.

1538
02:08:20,583 --> 02:08:24,461
There was always
a million sparkles on the water.

1539
02:08:26,256 --> 02:08:30,175
Like that mountain lake.
It was so clear, Jenny,

1540
02:08:30,301 --> 02:08:34,888
it looked like there were two skies,
one on top of the other.

1541
02:08:37,433 --> 02:08:40,477
And then, in the desert,
when the sun comes up,

1542
02:08:42,939 --> 02:08:47,109
I couldn't tell where heaven stopped

1543
02:08:47,652 --> 02:08:50,028
and the earth began.

1544
02:08:51,281 --> 02:08:53,156
It was so beautiful.

1545
02:08:57,870 --> 02:09:00,956
I wish I could've been there with you.

1546
02:09:04,043 --> 02:09:05,460
You were.

1547
02:09:16,180 --> 02:09:17,639
I love you.

1548
02:09:22,020 --> 02:09:25,355
You died on a Saturday morning.

1549
02:09:27,066 --> 02:09:30,819
And I had you placed
here under our tree.

1550
02:09:35,700 --> 02:09:40,537
And I had that house of your father's
bulldozed to the ground.

1551
02:09:44,667 --> 02:09:46,335
Mama

1552
02:09:47,420 --> 02:09:52,424
always said that dying was a part of life.

1553
02:09:55,845 --> 02:09:58,180
I sure wish it wasn't.

1554
02:10:00,850 --> 02:10:04,603
Little Forrest is doing just fine.

1555
02:10:05,938 --> 02:10:07,022
But...

1556
02:10:07,273 --> 02:10:09,941
About to start school again soon,

1557
02:10:11,778 --> 02:10:15,571
and I make his breakfast, lunch
and dinner every day.

1558
02:10:17,741 --> 02:10:23,746
I make sure he combs his hair
and brushes his teeth every day.

1559
02:10:26,875 --> 02:10:29,460
Teaching him how to play Ping-Pong.

1560
02:10:30,754 --> 02:10:31,796
Okay.

1561
02:10:32,047 --> 02:10:33,214
He's really good.

1562
02:10:33,298 --> 02:10:35,424
Forrest, you go.

1563
02:10:39,638 --> 02:10:41,222
We fish a lot.

1564
02:10:44,768 --> 02:10:48,229
(SOBBING) And every night, we read
a book. He's so smart, Jenny.

1565
02:10:51,483 --> 02:10:53,734
You'd be so proud of him.

1566
02:10:55,445 --> 02:10:56,904
I am.

1567
02:10:57,948 --> 02:11:01,158
He wrote you a letter.

1568
02:11:02,744 --> 02:11:04,787
And he says I can't read it.

1569
02:11:04,913 --> 02:11:08,457
I'm not supposed to,
so I'll just leave it here for you.

1570
02:11:24,516 --> 02:11:25,850
Jenny,

1571
02:11:31,648 --> 02:11:34,859
I don't know if Mama was right,

1572
02:11:36,194 --> 02:11:37,695
or if it's Lieutenant Dan.

1573
02:11:37,821 --> 02:11:40,406
I don't know

1574
02:11:40,490 --> 02:11:44,994
if we each have a destiny,

1575
02:11:47,038 --> 02:11:52,168
or if we're all just floating around
accidental-like on a breeze.

1576
02:11:56,673 --> 02:11:58,507
But I think

1577
02:12:00,385 --> 02:12:02,178
maybe it's both.

1578
02:12:06,516 --> 02:12:09,393
Maybe both is happening
at the same time.

1579
02:12:15,525 --> 02:12:17,526
But I miss you, Jenny.

1580
02:12:23,909 --> 02:12:28,329
If there's anything you need,
I won't be far away.

1581
02:13:03,614 --> 02:13:06,574
Here's your bus. Okay.

1582
02:13:08,244 --> 02:13:11,579
Hey. I know this.

1583
02:13:11,705 --> 02:13:14,582
I'm gonna show that
for show-and-tell because

1584
02:13:14,708 --> 02:13:17,377
Grandma used to read it to you.

1585
02:13:17,461 --> 02:13:19,587
My favorite book.

1586
02:13:22,925 --> 02:13:24,425
Here we are.

1587
02:13:24,593 --> 02:13:26,052
Okay.

1588
02:13:27,763 --> 02:13:29,264
Here you go.

1589
02:13:34,144 --> 02:13:36,646
Hey, Forrest, don't...

1590
02:13:40,109 --> 02:13:43,820
- I wanted to tell you, I love you.
- I love you, too, Daddy.

1591
02:13:45,823 --> 02:13:48,616
I'll be right here when you get back.

1592
02:13:53,163 --> 02:13:56,416
You understand this is
the bus to school, now, don't you?

1593
02:13:56,500 --> 02:14:00,044
Of course, and you are Dorothy Harris,
and I'm Forrest Gump.
