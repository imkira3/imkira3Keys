Our world, their world --

3
00:00:23,187 --> 00:00:25,121
it is a Pokémon world,

4
00:00:25,256 --> 00:00:28,054

creatures imaginable.

thrive in the mountains,

7
00:00:32,897 --> 00:00:35,457

landscapes of cities.

the grains of sand

on your favorite beach.

11
00:00:41,305 --> 00:00:44,638
Mankind and Pokémon alike
have long journeyed together

12
00:00:44,776 --> 00:00:48,644
to experience the thrill and
challenge of the Pokémon battle,

13
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,840
Iiving and learning together
as teammates --

14
00:00:51,983 --> 00:00:55,714
sometimes opponents, yes,
but ever friends.

15
00:00:56,454 --> 00:00:57,887
Yet there are those

16
00:00:58,056 --> 00:01:00,718
who blindly take advantage
of a Pokémon's trust

17
00:01:00,858 --> 00:01:03,884
to further their own selfish,
egotistical ambitions

18
00:01:04,028 --> 00:01:06,189
in the name of darkness.

19
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:08,696
But as the pendulum swings
both ways,

20
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:11,063
there are the Pokémon Rangers
as well,

21
00:01:11,202 --> 00:01:13,500
whose job it is
to protect Pokémon

22
00:01:13,638 --> 00:01:15,868
and protect nature,

23
00:01:16,007 --> 00:01:19,306

that is nature.

within its protecting arms

as Ash Ketchum of Pallet Town,

who, along with his beloved
Pikachu,

27
00:01:28,586 --> 00:01:30,554
has set his sights
on nothing less

28
00:01:30,721 --> 00:01:32,746
than becoming a Pokémon master,

29
00:01:32,924 --> 00:01:36,360

equally dedicated friends,

of Pokémon and people together,

one might expect -- or not.

00:40:11,974 --> 00:40:14,704
However, the temple appears now

669
00:40:14,843 --> 00:40:17,641
only at the time of
the total eclipse of the Moon.

670
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:19,338
That's when
the People of the Water

671
00:40:19,481 --> 00:40:21,108
were said to have held
their festival

672
00:40:21,283 --> 00:40:23,751
honoring the water Pokémon.

673
00:40:23,919 --> 00:40:27,355
Wow.
A temple that travels the ocean.

674
00:40:27,523 --> 00:40:28,421
But wait.

675
00:40:28,557 --> 00:40:31,549
Since it can't be seen,
how do you find it?.

676
00:40:31,693 --> 00:40:34,059
LlZABETH:
We think Manaphy can.

677
00:40:34,196 --> 00:40:35,356
Mana!

678
00:40:35,497 --> 00:40:38,432
The People of the Water
originally built the temple

679
00:40:38,567 --> 00:40:41,468
in the exact same place
where the Manaphy lived.

680
00:40:41,603 --> 00:40:45,039
SHlP: Even after the temple
began to move about freely,

681
00:40:45,174 --> 00:40:48,405
all Manaphy have been born
with a kind of homing instinct,

682
00:40:48,544 --> 00:40:51,877
which allows them to locate
the temple at any time.

683
00:40:54,116 --> 00:40:56,243
So as long as we've got Manaphy,

684
00:40:56,418 --> 00:40:58,545
we'll be able to find
the temple.

685
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,655
So that's why all those men
were all after Manaphy.

686
00:41:01,824 --> 00:41:02,688
-Mm.
-Mm.

687
00:41:02,858 --> 00:41:04,792
They wanted to steal
the Sea Crown.

688
00:41:04,927 --> 00:41:07,623
We must protect the Sea Temple
at all costs.

689
00:41:07,763 --> 00:41:10,755
We must also protect Manaphy
at all costs,

690
00:41:10,899 --> 00:41:13,766
especially from the crusty
old codger with the beard.

691
00:41:13,902 --> 00:41:15,301
So, who is that guy?.

692
00:41:15,437 --> 00:41:15,732
Phantom the Pirate.

693
00:41:16,104 --> 00:41:17,469
Phantom the Pirate.

694
00:41:17,539 --> 00:41:19,302
He's one mean dude.

I'm Meowth.

Give them their reward.

706
00:41:47,069 --> 00:41:48,127
Give them their reward.

707
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:50,295
Yes, sir.

708
00:41:50,439 --> 00:41:52,498
Thank you, Your Highness.
You're too kind.

709
00:41:52,641 --> 00:41:55,337
Word out on the street is that
you're the pirate's pajamas.

710
00:41:55,477 --> 00:41:58,776
Perhaps you could use
some extra dirty hands.

711
00:42:01,416 --> 00:42:03,316
How are you at cleaning?.

-The dirtiest.
-The dirtiest.

713
00:42:19,101 --> 00:42:20,728
GALEN: It appears
that the People of the Water

714
00:42:20,869 --> 00:42:23,030
employed quite an elaborate
system of water routes

715
00:42:23,171 --> 00:42:25,105
for their trade.

716
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,731
So it's difficult
to pinpoint their exit.

717
00:42:27,876 --> 00:42:30,845
They're now heading
for the Sea Temple,

718
00:42:30,979 --> 00:42:34,142
so let us go and wait for them
to fall into our trap.

Our trap!

00:48:33,108 --> 00:48:34,837
Well, I remember the first thing

833
00:48:34,976 --> 00:48:37,001
that Lizabeth said
was "foo-foo."

834
00:48:37,145 --> 00:48:39,045
-That means "food," right?.
-Uh-huh.

835
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:42,149
-You sure loved to eat.
-What?.

836
00:48:42,317 --> 00:48:43,944
Say "Ash," Manaphy.

837
00:48:44,119 --> 00:48:46,212
-Come on and say "Ash."
-Now say "Hi, Max."

838
00:48:46,388 --> 00:48:47,252
Mana.

839
00:48:47,389 --> 00:48:49,619
Wow!
I heard you say "Max."

840
00:48:49,758 --> 00:48:51,350
Didn't sound like "Max" to me.

841
00:48:51,493 --> 00:48:52,926
No?.

842
00:48:53,061 --> 00:48:54,085
Happy.

843
00:48:54,229 --> 00:48:56,356
-You're so cute!
-Happy.

844
00:49:03,738 --> 00:49:06,571
All right, May,
you can release Manaphy now.

845
00:49:06,708 --> 00:49:07,402
Now?.

846
00:49:07,542 --> 00:49:10,739
From now on, Manaphy needs to
choose its own path.

847
00:49:10,879 --> 00:49:12,107
By itself?.

848
00:49:12,247 --> 00:49:13,578
Right.

849
00:49:13,715 --> 00:49:15,945
It's the way that it has to be.

850
00:49:16,117 --> 00:49:19,018
All that we can do
is just watch.

851
00:49:21,356 --> 00:49:24,086
Time for you to go, Manaphy,
by yourself.

852
00:49:24,225 --> 00:49:25,556

853
00:49:25,694 --> 00:49:27,059

Good. Let's go.

861
00:50:04,966 --> 00:50:07,833
All right, down this way.

865
00:50:22,617 --> 00:50:25,142
It's like an aquarium!

00:50:42,871 --> 00:50:46,329
Come on. Okay.
It doesn't hurt.

871
00:50:47,242 --> 00:50:47,901
Phy?.

872
00:50:48,043 --> 00:50:49,635

SHlP: All alone.

877
00:51:09,964 --> 00:51:13,263
That's the way Manaphy
will travel the entire ocean,

878
00:51:13,401 --> 00:51:17,895
finally returning to its home,
which is the Sea Temple.

879
00:51:18,573 --> 00:51:19,665
But how?.

880
00:51:19,808 --> 00:51:21,776
How does Manaphy know
where to go?.

881
00:51:21,910 --> 00:51:23,605
It's so strange.

882
00:51:29,184 --> 00:51:32,119
The total lunar eclipse
is coming soon.

883
00:51:32,287 --> 00:51:33,948
If our timing is just right,

884
00:51:34,122 --> 00:51:36,420
we might get a chance to view
the Sea Temple

885
00:51:36,558 --> 00:51:38,048
with our own eyes.

886
00:51:38,226 --> 00:51:40,091
And receive the blessings
of the sea,

887
00:51:40,228 --> 00:51:42,719
as the People of the Water did.

888
00:51:54,142 --> 00:51:57,908
This is Jack Walker here,
en route, no problems.

889
00:51:58,046 --> 00:51:59,445
Jackie, please.

890
00:51:59,581 --> 00:52:01,674
Save the vacation
for when you're done.

891
00:52:01,816 --> 00:52:02,783
Okay.

892
00:52:02,951 --> 00:52:06,717
But there's not a single bad guy
in sight, so just relax.

893
00:52:12,961 --> 00:52:15,521
Being a Pokémon Ranger
is just so cool.

Manaphy's sitting
on that Wailord.

901
00:52:59,274 --> 00:53:00,366
Look at that.

902
00:53:00,508 --> 00:53:03,102
Hi, Manaphy!

Hey, so, why'd you become
a Pokémon Ranger

911
00:53:49,457 --> 00:53:52,153
in the first place, Jackie?.

912
00:53:52,293 --> 00:53:53,954
I was a kid.

913
00:53:54,095 --> 00:53:57,792
I got stuck,
and these Pokémon saved my life.

914
00:54:01,035 --> 00:54:02,559
I was hiking up in the mountains

915
00:54:02,704 --> 00:54:05,639
when a sudden blizzard came up,
trapping me.

916
00:54:05,773 --> 00:54:07,866
It just kept blowing harder
and harder.

917
00:54:08,009 --> 00:54:11,035
I thought that was the end
for sure.

918
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:16,912
I'd never experienced
bitter cold like that before.

919
00:54:17,085 --> 00:54:19,178
[ Chirping ]

920
00:54:22,690 --> 00:54:23,657
When, all of a sudden,

921
00:54:23,825 --> 00:54:26,259
this group of migrating
forest Pokémon was there.

922
00:54:26,394 --> 00:54:28,521
And one by one, they
started to gather 'round me,

923
00:54:28,663 --> 00:54:31,427
Iike a bunch
of hot-water bottles.

924
00:54:41,242 --> 00:54:43,608
You're so warm.

00:55:08,169 --> 00:55:09,966
If they hadn't been
so kind to me back then,

927
00:55:10,104 --> 00:55:12,470
I wouldn't be here today.

928
00:55:12,607 --> 00:55:15,337
I guess I wanted to be
a Pokémon Ranger ever since.

929
00:55:15,476 --> 00:55:17,103
Wow.
Great story.

What is it?.

Please help separate Manaphy

Oh.

Remember, Manaphy
is the Prince of the Sea

00:58:22,497 --> 00:58:25,660
and destined to become leader
of all the Sea Temple Pokémon.

I hadn't thought of that.

You can't expect Manaphy
to stay with you forever.
