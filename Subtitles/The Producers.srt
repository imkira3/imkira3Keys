<i>Opening night
Opening night</i>

3
00:01:42,009 --> 00:01:45,554
<i>It's opening night</i>

4
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:51,560
<i>It's Max Bialystock's latest show</i>

5
00:01:51,727 --> 00:01:54,563
<i>Will it flop or will it go?</i>

6
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:57,733
<i>The cast is taking its final bow</i>

7
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,736
<i>Here comes the audience now</i>

8
00:02:00,903 --> 00:02:03,572
<i>The doors are open
They're on their way</i>

9
00:02:03,739 --> 00:02:08,202
<i>Let's hear what they have to say</i>

10
00:02:09,912 --> 00:02:13,249
<i>He's done it again
He's done it again</i>

11
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:16,252
<i>Max Bialystock has done it again</i>

12
00:02:16,419 --> 00:02:19,338
<i>We can't believe it</i>

13
00:02:19,505 --> 00:02:22,425
<i>You can't conceive it</i>

14
00:02:22,591 --> 00:02:25,177
<i>How'd he achieve it?</i>

15
00:02:25,344 --> 00:02:28,806
<i>It's the worst show in town</i>

16
00:02:28,973 --> 00:02:31,767
<i>We sat there sighing</i>

17
00:02:31,934 --> 00:02:34,854
<i>Groaning and crying</i>

18
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,481
<i>There's no denying</i>

19
00:02:37,648 --> 00:02:40,776
<i>It's the worst show in town</i>

20
00:02:40,943 --> 00:02:43,988
<i>Oh, we wanted to stand up and hiss</i>

21
00:02:44,155 --> 00:02:48,993
<i>We've seen shit
But never like this</i>

22
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:52,413
<i>Max Bialystock has done it again</i>

23
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:58,627
<i>The songs were rotten
The book was stinkin'</i>

24
00:02:58,794 --> 00:03:02,214
<i>What he did to Shakespeare
Booth did to Lincoln</i>

25
00:03:02,381 --> 00:03:05,342
We had this specially made up
for Max Bialystock.

26
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:12,183
<i>We couldn't leave faster</i>

27
00:03:14,477 --> 00:03:17,605
<i>What a disaster</i>

28
00:03:17,772 --> 00:03:20,566
<i>We are still in shock</i>

29
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:23,277
<i>Who produced this schlock?</i>

30
00:03:23,444 --> 00:03:28,491
<i>That slimy, sleazy Max Bialystock</i>

31
00:03:29,116 --> 00:03:30,743
<i>What a bum</i>

32
00:03:42,046 --> 00:03:43,714
Hello?

33
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:48,344
Mr. Bialystock?

34
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,604
Anybody here?

35
00:03:59,355 --> 00:04:00,689
Mr. Bialystock?

36
00:04:02,525 --> 00:04:05,111
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

37
00:04:05,277 --> 00:04:07,446
What do you want?

38
00:04:07,613 --> 00:04:10,032
Speak to me, dummy. Speak!

39
00:04:10,658 --> 00:04:12,743
Why don't you speak?

40
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:15,121
Scared. Can't talk.

41
00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:18,624
All right, I'm sorry.

42
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:21,669
I'm sorry. Calm down. Get ahold
of yourself. Come with me.

43
00:04:21,836 --> 00:04:24,547
Come on. Come on.

44
00:04:24,714 --> 00:04:27,883
Come on, right this way.
Watch your step.

45
00:04:29,051 --> 00:04:31,095
Look, just...

46
00:04:31,262 --> 00:04:33,556
Take a deep breath.

47
00:04:33,723 --> 00:04:35,891
Let it out slowly.

48
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,856
- Who are you?
- I am Leopold Bloom.

49
00:04:42,022 --> 00:04:44,525
I'm an accountant.
I'm from Whitehall & Marks...

50
00:04:44,692 --> 00:04:47,987
and I've come to do your books.
- Oh, you have, huh? Well, listen...

51
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:51,198
- Who is it?
- Hold Me-Touch Me.

52
00:04:51,365 --> 00:04:54,410
Hold Me-Touch Me.
One of my backers.

53
00:04:54,577 --> 00:04:57,621
Listen, I have to meet
with an important investor.

54
00:04:57,788 --> 00:05:00,082
Do me a big favour,
go to the bathroom.

55
00:05:00,249 --> 00:05:05,087
- But I don't have to go.
- Try. Try. Think of Niagara Falls.

56
00:05:07,089 --> 00:05:10,801
Be with you in a moment,
my darling.

57
00:05:13,888 --> 00:05:17,516
Hold Me-Touch Me.
Where is Hold Me-Touch Me?

58
00:05:17,683 --> 00:05:19,351
Kiss Me-Feel Me,
Clinch Me-Pinch Me...

59
00:05:19,518 --> 00:05:20,811
Lick Me-Bite Me, Suck Me...

60
00:05:20,978 --> 00:05:22,897
Here she is. Hold Me-Touch Me.

61
00:05:23,064 --> 00:05:26,108
You know, it worked.
As soon as I pictured Niagara Falls...

62
00:05:26,275 --> 00:05:31,030
I didn't have any trouble at all...
- Back. Back. Don't make a sound.

63
00:05:34,283 --> 00:05:37,286
Coming. Coming.

64
00:05:55,971 --> 00:05:58,557
Hello, gorgeous.

65
00:05:58,724 --> 00:06:03,104
- Hold me, touch me.
- As soon as I shut the door.

66
00:06:07,817 --> 00:06:09,443
Did you bring the checkie?

67
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:13,572
Bialy can't produce plays
without checkies.

68
00:06:13,739 --> 00:06:16,158
Here you go.

69
00:06:18,202 --> 00:06:21,497
But first,
can we please play a game?

70
00:06:21,664 --> 00:06:24,583
One dirty little game.

71
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:29,004
All right, my little sex kitten.

72
00:06:29,171 --> 00:06:30,881
What shall we play?

73
00:06:31,048 --> 00:06:33,050
The Debutante and the Bricklayer?

74
00:06:33,217 --> 00:06:35,010
- Oh, no.
- No.

75
00:06:35,177 --> 00:06:37,638
How about the Rabbi
and the Contortionist?

76
00:06:37,805 --> 00:06:40,850
You like that one, mama,
keeps you limber.

77
00:06:41,016 --> 00:06:42,309
I know.

78
00:06:42,476 --> 00:06:47,857
Let's play the Virgin Milkmaid
and the Well-Hung Stableboy.

79
00:06:51,026 --> 00:06:53,237
I don't think I have the strength.

80
00:06:53,404 --> 00:06:57,658
- Don't worry, I'll be gentle.
- All right.

81
00:07:00,786 --> 00:07:02,955
Oh, dear...

82
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:09,545
this milk is so heavy.
I'll never reach the house.

83
00:07:09,712 --> 00:07:13,382
You there, well-hung stableboy.

84
00:07:14,383 --> 00:07:18,137
Won't you please help me?

85
00:07:20,556 --> 00:07:23,350
Of course, my little dairy queen.

86
00:07:23,517 --> 00:07:27,146
First I'll take your milk.

87
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:30,649
Then I shall take your virginity!

88
00:07:31,067 --> 00:07:34,737
No! No! Never! Never!

89
00:07:34,904 --> 00:07:37,782
Yes. Yes.

90
00:07:37,948 --> 00:07:40,576
Give it to me, well-hung!
Give it to me.

91
00:07:40,743 --> 00:07:43,412
Darling, wait,
I haven't even had coffee yet.

92
00:07:43,579 --> 00:07:46,332
- Take it easy. Take it easy.
- Oh, my God.

93
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:50,544
Send me to the moon, you animal.
Send me to the moon.

94
00:07:50,711 --> 00:07:55,091
Yes. Yes, my darling.
Thursday. Come back Thursday.

95
00:07:55,257 --> 00:07:59,595
I'll send you to the moon Thursday.
I may even join you.

96
00:07:59,762 --> 00:08:01,931
But first, the checkie.

97
00:08:02,098 --> 00:08:06,018
Where's the checkie?
Come on, come on, find the checkie.

98
00:08:06,894 --> 00:08:09,522
Here you go.

99
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:16,362
I made it out, like you told me,
to the title of the play:

100
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:18,072
<i>- Cash.
- Yes.</i>

101
00:08:18,239 --> 00:08:21,075
<i>That's a funny name
for a play, Cash.</i>

102
00:08:21,242 --> 00:08:24,036
<i>Yes, so was The Iceman Cometh.</i>

103
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:25,955
I'll see you Thursday.

104
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:30,209
- Bye.
- Bye. Bye.

105
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:33,379
Yes, yes, yes.

106
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:41,387
You dirty old buzzard.

107
00:08:42,012 --> 00:08:44,724
May I come out of the bathroom now,
Mr. Bialystock?

108
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:47,643
- Yeah, sure.
- I'm terribly sorry I caught you...

109
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:51,647
feeling up the old lady.
- " Feeling up the old lady."

110
00:08:51,814 --> 00:08:53,858
Thank you, Mr. Tact.

111
00:08:54,024 --> 00:08:57,153
- May I take your coat?
- Oh, thank you.

112
00:08:57,319 --> 00:08:59,238
So you're an accountant, huh?

113
00:08:59,447 --> 00:09:01,824
- Yes, sir. I am, sir.
- Then account for yourself!

114
00:09:01,991 --> 00:09:05,077
<i>Why are you looking up little
old ladies' dresses? Bit of a pervert?</i>

115
00:09:05,286 --> 00:09:06,954
I know what you're thinking.

116
00:09:07,121 --> 00:09:09,832
How dare you condemn me
without knowing all the facts.

117
00:09:09,999 --> 00:09:12,418
- Mr. Bialystock, I wasn't condemn...
- Shut up!

118
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:15,129
I'm having a rhetorical conversation.

119
00:09:15,296 --> 00:09:19,467
- Do you know who I used to be?
- Well, yes. You're Max Bialystock...

120
00:09:19,633 --> 00:09:24,055
the king of Broadway.
- No, I'm Max Bialy... That's right.

121
00:09:24,221 --> 00:09:27,266
- That's right.
- And might I say, Mr. Bialystock...

122
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:29,935
And please don't take this
the wrong way...

123
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:32,813
but you're not just a dirty old man.
- Thank you.

124
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:36,150
Oh, you're also
a great Broadway producer.

125
00:09:36,317 --> 00:09:39,195
And there's something about me
you should know.

126
00:09:39,361 --> 00:09:40,905
When I was a kid...

127
00:09:41,072 --> 00:09:45,076
<i>I had the good fortune
to be taken to Bialy-Hoos of '42.</i>

128
00:09:45,242 --> 00:09:47,286
<i>- Oh, Bialy-Hoos.
- Yes.</i>

129
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:50,373
And I still have the ticket stub.

130
00:09:50,539 --> 00:09:52,500
- Oh, look at that.
- Yeah.

131
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:55,795
And ever since,
I've had a secret desire...

132
00:09:55,961 --> 00:09:58,881
to be a Broadway producer.

133
00:09:59,048 --> 00:10:01,509
A secret desire, huh?

134
00:10:01,675 --> 00:10:05,054
- Kid, can I give you some advice?
- Yes, sir.

135
00:10:05,221 --> 00:10:07,681
Keep it a secret.
Do the books, please.

136
00:10:07,848 --> 00:10:09,975
Top drawer, to the left.

137
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:19,151
Oh, my God.

138
00:10:19,777 --> 00:10:21,195
Will you look at that.

139
00:10:21,362 --> 00:10:26,450
That's it, baby!
When you got it, flaunt it! Flaunt it!

140
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:30,830
Mr. Bialystock,
may I speak to you a minute?

141
00:10:31,414 --> 00:10:32,957
- A minute?
- Yes.

142
00:10:33,124 --> 00:10:34,417
- Just one minute?
- Yes.

143
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:36,669
- Okay.
- In glancing at your books...

144
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:40,214
- Go! You have 58 seconds left.
...I noticed that in the column...

145
00:10:40,381 --> 00:10:42,717
- You're gonna time it?
- Time is money.

146
00:10:42,883 --> 00:10:46,095
I looked at your books and the
columns marked "monies received."

147
00:10:46,262 --> 00:10:49,265
- And I can't make the figures work out.
- Forty-eight seconds. Hurry.

148
00:10:49,432 --> 00:10:53,060
- There's a problem with your figures.
- Twenty-eight. Running out of time.

149
00:10:53,227 --> 00:10:55,604
- Tick, tock. Tick, tock. Tick, tock.
- I cannot...

150
00:10:55,771 --> 00:10:57,857
- Fifteen seconds.
- I cannot... I can't function.

151
00:10:58,023 --> 00:11:01,318
- I cannot function in these conditions.
- Five, four, three, two, one.

152
00:11:01,485 --> 00:11:04,822
You're making me
extremely nervous.

153
00:11:05,781 --> 00:11:07,450
What is that, a handkerchief?

154
00:11:07,616 --> 00:11:10,494
What? This? No, it's nothing.
It's nothing.

155
00:11:10,661 --> 00:11:14,957
Well, if it's nothing,
then why can't I see it?

156
00:11:15,624 --> 00:11:19,628
My blanket. My blue blanket!

157
00:11:19,795 --> 00:11:22,339
Give me back my blue blanket!

158
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:28,387
Give me my blanket! Give it to me.
Give it to me. Give me the blanket.

159
00:11:30,306 --> 00:11:32,308
Give it to me! Give it to me!

160
00:11:32,475 --> 00:11:34,602
Here, here, here.

161
00:11:34,769 --> 00:11:38,105
Don't panic. Don't panic.
Don't panic.

162
00:11:38,272 --> 00:11:40,274
I...

163
00:11:40,441 --> 00:11:41,692
I'm sorry.

164
00:11:41,859 --> 00:11:44,737
It's just that I don't like anyone
touching my blue blanket.

165
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:48,157
It's not important,
it's a minor compulsion.

166
00:11:48,324 --> 00:11:50,201
I can deal with it if I want to.

167
00:11:50,368 --> 00:11:55,081
But I've had it ever since I was a baby,
and I find it very comforting.

168
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,668
I need to lie down for a minute now.

169
00:12:04,131 --> 00:12:06,509
They come here. They all come here.

170
00:12:06,675 --> 00:12:10,179
How do they find me?

171
00:12:10,554 --> 00:12:13,140
Hey, kid. Hey.

172
00:12:14,642 --> 00:12:17,228
Look at this.

173
00:12:17,395 --> 00:12:18,854
How can I help you?

174
00:12:19,021 --> 00:12:21,482
- What's wrong?
- You're gonna jump on me.

175
00:12:21,649 --> 00:12:23,484
- What?
- You're gonna jump on me.

176
00:12:23,651 --> 00:12:27,530
I know you're gonna jump on me
and squash me like a bug.

177
00:12:27,697 --> 00:12:29,657
- Oh, God.
- Please, don't jump on me!

178
00:12:29,824 --> 00:12:32,493
I'm not gonna jump on you!
I'm not gonna jump on you!

179
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:35,329
Get ahold of yourself!
Stop it! Stop it!

180
00:12:35,496 --> 00:12:37,540
Stop! Calm down!

181
00:12:37,707 --> 00:12:39,917
Don't touch me! Don't touch me.

182
00:12:40,084 --> 00:12:43,254
- What's the matter now?
- I'm hysterical. I'm having hysterics.

183
00:12:43,421 --> 00:12:47,758
I can't stop when I get like this.
I can't stop. I'm hysterical.

184
00:12:48,259 --> 00:12:51,554
I can see that.
All right. All right, calm down.

185
00:12:51,721 --> 00:12:54,140
I'm coming, I'm coming.
Take it easy.

186
00:13:04,233 --> 00:13:05,651
I'm wet!

187
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:08,571
I'm wet.
I'm hysterical and I'm wet!

188
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,075
I'm in pain.

189
00:13:13,242 --> 00:13:15,202
I'm in pain, I'm wet...

190
00:13:15,369 --> 00:13:17,997
and I'm still hysterical.

191
00:13:18,873 --> 00:13:22,668
All right, all right. What can I do?
You're getting me hysterical.

192
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:24,086
Move away, you frighten me.

193
00:13:24,253 --> 00:13:25,693
- You're too close.
- I frighten you?

194
00:13:25,755 --> 00:13:29,425
Yes, get over there and stop
touching... Move over there! Sit down.

195
00:13:29,592 --> 00:13:31,886
I'm sitting, I'm sitting.

196
00:13:32,053 --> 00:13:33,679
You still look angry.

197
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:36,766
I'm sorry. How's this?

198
00:13:42,229 --> 00:13:44,982
Who's my little accountant?

199
00:13:45,608 --> 00:13:48,235
Who's my little accountant?

200
00:13:48,402 --> 00:13:52,281
Are you my little accountant?
Are you my little accountant?

201
00:13:52,448 --> 00:13:54,283
- Are you my little accountant?
- I am.

202
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:56,494
Yes, you are.

203
00:13:57,912 --> 00:14:01,290
Well, thank you for smiling.
That helped a great deal.

204
00:14:01,457 --> 00:14:03,042
Well, you know what they say:

205
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:06,379
"Smile and the world smiles
with you."

206
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:09,799
This man should be
in a straightjacket.

207
00:14:09,965 --> 00:14:12,802
- You feeling better?
- Oh, yes, I'm fine now. Thank you.

208
00:14:12,968 --> 00:14:15,471
- Good.
- May I speak to you?

209
00:14:15,638 --> 00:14:17,890
Yes, Prince Myshkin.
What can we do for you?

210
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:21,477
Well, this is hardly
the time for levity, Mr. Bialystock.

211
00:14:21,644 --> 00:14:23,604
I've discovered a serious error...

212
00:14:23,771 --> 00:14:26,524
<i>in the accounts of your last show,
Funny Boy.</i>

213
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:29,485
- Where? What?
- Well, according to the backers list...

214
00:14:29,652 --> 00:14:34,907
you raised $100,000.
But your show only cost 98,000.

215
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:36,867
There's 2000 unaccounted for.

216
00:14:37,034 --> 00:14:39,537
I went to a Turkish bath.
Who cares?

217
00:14:39,704 --> 00:14:41,997
The show was a flop.
Bloom, do me a favour...

218
00:14:42,164 --> 00:14:45,710
move a few decimal points around.
You can do it, you're an accountant.

219
00:14:45,876 --> 00:14:49,839
You're part of a noble profession.
The word "count" is part of your title.

220
00:14:50,005 --> 00:14:52,842
- That's cheating.
- It's not cheating.

221
00:14:53,008 --> 00:14:54,719
It's charity.

222
00:14:54,885 --> 00:14:56,971
Bloom...

223
00:14:57,138 --> 00:14:58,681
you see this stickpin?

224
00:14:58,848 --> 00:15:01,308
This once held a pearl
as big as your eye.

225
00:15:01,475 --> 00:15:06,772
I used to wear handmade
Italian shoes, $500 suits.

226
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:08,023
And look at me now.

227
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:12,570
Look at me now!
I'm wearing a cardboard belt.

228
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,994
Bloom, you gotta save me.

229
00:15:20,161 --> 00:15:21,454
I'm reaching out to you.

230
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:24,373
Don't send me to prison.

231
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:28,252
Help me.

232
00:15:32,673 --> 00:15:35,593
All right. All right.
Okay, I'll do it.

233
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,219
- Really?
- Yes, I'll do it.

234
00:15:37,386 --> 00:15:40,139
See, $2000 isn't so much.

235
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:42,266
I'm sure I can hide it someplace.

236
00:15:42,433 --> 00:15:45,978
After all, the IRS isn't interested
in a show that flopped.

237
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:48,230
Right. Good thinking.

238
00:15:48,397 --> 00:15:52,068
You figure it out.
I'm gonna take a little nap.

239
00:15:52,693 --> 00:15:54,028
Now, let's see.

240
00:15:54,195 --> 00:15:57,490
Let's see, if we add up
these deductions, we get...

241
00:15:57,656 --> 00:16:00,242
Carry the three, divide by four...

242
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:04,747
Amazing.

243
00:16:04,914 --> 00:16:07,416
It's absolutely amazing, but...

244
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:09,168
under the right circumstances...

245
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:11,921
a producer could
make more money with a flop...

246
00:16:12,088 --> 00:16:14,173
than he could with a hit.

247
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:17,843
Yes, it's quite possible. If he were
certain that a show would fail...

248
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,429
a man could make a fortune.

249
00:16:20,596 --> 00:16:22,515
- Yes?
- Yes, what?

250
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:25,518
- What you were saying. Keep talking.
- What was I saying?

251
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:27,228
You were saying that a producer...

252
00:16:27,395 --> 00:16:29,772
could make more money
with a flop than a hit.

253
00:16:29,939 --> 00:16:31,607
Well, yes. It's quite possible.

254
00:16:31,774 --> 00:16:33,984
You keep saying that,
but you don't say how.

255
00:16:34,151 --> 00:16:38,072
Well, it's simply a matter
of creative accounting.

256
00:16:38,239 --> 00:16:41,784
Let's assume for a moment
that you are a dishonest man.

257
00:16:41,951 --> 00:16:43,202
Assume away.

258
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:46,747
<i>All right. When you produced
your last show, Funny Boy...</i>

259
00:16:46,914 --> 00:16:49,709
you raised $2000
more than you needed.

260
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,711
But you could've raised a million...

261
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:54,630
put on your $100,000 flop
and kept the rest.

262
00:16:54,797 --> 00:16:57,800
- But what if my show was a hit?
- Then you would go to jail.

263
00:16:57,967 --> 00:17:00,136
See, rather than 100 percent
of the show...

264
00:17:00,302 --> 00:17:02,513
you would've sold
more than 1000 percent.

265
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:06,267
So if the show's a success,
there's no way to pay off the backers.

266
00:17:06,434 --> 00:17:07,977
- Get it?
- Got it.

267
00:17:08,144 --> 00:17:11,397
So in order for our scheme to work,
we'd have to find a sure-fire flop.

268
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:13,399
<i>"Our scheme"? What scheme?</i>

269
00:17:14,191 --> 00:17:15,526
What scheme?

270
00:17:15,693 --> 00:17:18,612
Your scheme,
you bloody little genius.

271
00:17:18,779 --> 00:17:22,324
I meant no scheme. I merely posed
a little academic accounting theory.

272
00:17:22,491 --> 00:17:24,660
- It was just a thought.
- Bloom...

273
00:17:24,827 --> 00:17:27,997
worlds are turned
on such thoughts.

274
00:17:28,164 --> 00:17:31,751
Don't you see, Bloom?
Darling Bloom, glorious Bloom.

275
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:33,169
It's so simple.

276
00:17:33,335 --> 00:17:35,713
Step one,
we find the worst play ever written.

277
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,049
Step two,
we hire the worst director in town.

278
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:41,052
- Step three, I raise 2 million dollars.
- Two?

279
00:17:41,218 --> 00:17:44,680
Yes, one for me, one for you. There's
a lot of little old ladies out there.

280
00:17:44,847 --> 00:17:48,184
Step four, we hire the worst actors
in New York and open on Broadway.

281
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:51,020
And before you can say "step five,"
we close on Broadway...

282
00:17:51,187 --> 00:17:54,106
take our 2 million and go to Rio.

283
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:56,859
Rio? That'd never work.

284
00:17:57,026 --> 00:17:59,487
Oh, ye of little faith.

285
00:18:01,197 --> 00:18:04,909
<i>What did Lewis say to Clark
When everything look ed bleak?</i>

286
00:18:05,076 --> 00:18:06,827
<i>What did Sir Edmund say to Tenzing</i>

287
00:18:06,994 --> 00:18:09,872
<i>As they struggled
Toward Everest's peak?</i>

288
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:11,874
<i>What did Washington say
To his troops</i>

289
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:14,085
<i>As they crossed the Delaware?</i>

290
00:18:14,251 --> 00:18:18,005
<i>I'm sure you're well aware</i>

291
00:18:18,172 --> 00:18:19,965
What'd they say?

292
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:22,968
<i>We can do it</i>

293
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:25,012
<i>We can do it</i>

294
00:18:25,179 --> 00:18:29,308
<i>We can do it Me and you</i>

295
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:31,143
<i>We can do it</i>

296
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,229
<i>We can do it</i>

297
00:18:33,396 --> 00:18:36,649
<i>We can make our dreams come true</i>

298
00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:39,735
<i>Everything you've ever wanted</i>

299
00:18:39,902 --> 00:18:43,239
<i>Is just waiting to be had</i>

300
00:18:43,406 --> 00:18:46,826
<i>Beautiful girls
Wearing nothing but pearls</i>

301
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:49,829
<i>Caressing you, undressing you
And driving you mad</i>

302
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:51,706
No.

303
00:18:52,581 --> 00:18:54,959
Bloom. Bloom, wait a minute, now.

304
00:18:55,126 --> 00:18:58,754
Hear me out. Just think about it.

305
00:19:10,307 --> 00:19:12,017
Stop!

306
00:19:12,226 --> 00:19:14,937
<i>We can do it We can do it</i>

307
00:19:15,104 --> 00:19:18,315
<i>This is not the time to shirk</i>

308
00:19:18,482 --> 00:19:21,444
<i>We can do it You won't rue it</i>

309
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:24,739
<i>Say goodbye to petty clerk</i>

463
00:32:07,251 --> 00:32:10,546
<i>- With your brilliance, my resilience
- I'm gonna be a producer</i>

464
00:32:10,713 --> 00:32:13,716
<i>- Up together we will zoom
- Up together we will zoom</i>

465
00:32:13,883 --> 00:32:16,969
<i>- We can do it, we can do it
- We can do it, we can do it</i>

466
00:32:17,136 --> 00:32:20,306
<i>Every show I touch I doom</i>

467
00:32:20,473 --> 00:32:22,058
<i>- We were fated
- We were fated</i>

468
00:32:22,224 --> 00:32:23,809
<i>- To be mated
- To be mated</i>

469
00:32:23,976 --> 00:32:30,399
<i>- We're Bialystock and Bloom
- We're Bialystock and Bloom</i>

470
00:32:45,915 --> 00:32:47,458
Oh, Max...

471
00:32:47,625 --> 00:32:50,753
Oh, Max, let's give up.
I can't read anymore.

472
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:54,465
- How many plays can a person read?
- Stop complaining.

473
00:32:54,632 --> 00:32:56,759
We have to find the worst play
ever written.

474
00:32:56,926 --> 00:32:58,886
- I've been reading all night.
- Who cares?

475
00:32:59,053 --> 00:33:02,306
You wanna be a producer, read,
read. Keep reading.

476
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,060
Here's one.

477
00:33:06,227 --> 00:33:08,104
Act I, scene one.

478
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:10,856
"Gregor Samsa awoke one morning
to discover...

479
00:33:11,023 --> 00:33:15,444
that he had been transformed
into a giant cockroach."

480
00:33:16,696 --> 00:33:18,906
No, too good.

481
00:33:22,034 --> 00:33:25,913
" But how could you see me?
The glass was frosted."

482
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,959
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
I've read this before.

483
00:33:30,126 --> 00:33:34,338
I think I've read this one before.
What's it called? What's it called?

484
00:33:34,505 --> 00:33:36,132
<i>The Frosted Glass.</i>

485
00:33:36,298 --> 00:33:38,968
Max, I'm reading plays
that I read last night, Max.

486
00:33:39,135 --> 00:33:41,137
I can't go on anymore.
It's too much.

487
00:33:41,303 --> 00:33:44,974
Let's face it, we'll never find it.

488
00:33:53,232 --> 00:33:56,277
We'll never find it.
We'll never find it.

489
00:33:56,444 --> 00:33:59,488
We'll never find it.
We'll never find it.

490
00:33:59,655 --> 00:34:02,992
Leo. Leo. See it? Smell it.

491
00:34:03,159 --> 00:34:05,911
Touch it. Kiss it. Kiss it.

492
00:34:06,078 --> 00:34:07,413
It's the mother lode.

493
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,665
- What is it? You found a flop?
- A flop.

494
00:34:09,832 --> 00:34:11,625
That's putting it mildly.

495
00:34:11,792 --> 00:34:13,544
This is a catastrophe.

496
00:34:13,711 --> 00:34:18,215
A disaster certain to offend peoples
of all races, creeds and religions.

497
00:34:18,382 --> 00:34:21,635
A guaranteed-to-close-in-one-night
beauty.

498
00:34:21,802 --> 00:34:24,597
- Well, let's see it.
- Here.

499
00:34:27,558 --> 00:34:29,643
<i>"Springtime for Hitler...</i>

500
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:33,689
a gay romp with Eva and Adolf
at Berchtesgaden."

501
00:34:36,108 --> 00:34:38,361
Oh, my God.

502
00:34:38,903 --> 00:34:40,196
"Oh, my God" is right.

503
00:34:40,363 --> 00:34:43,407
It's practically a love letter to Hitler.

504
00:34:43,574 --> 00:34:47,203
- Max, this won't run a week.
- A week? Are you kidding?

505
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:50,873
This play has got to close
on page four.

506
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,458
What's the author's name again?

507
00:34:52,625 --> 00:34:57,046
" Franz Liebkind. 61 Jane Street,
New York, New York."

508
00:34:57,213 --> 00:35:00,341
Franz Liebkind. 61 Jane Street.

509
00:35:00,508 --> 00:35:05,054
<i>Let's go. We'll get the Broadway
rights to Springtime for Hitler...</i>

510
00:35:05,221 --> 00:35:07,348
even if we have to go so far
as to pay him.

511
00:35:08,391 --> 00:35:11,060
- Come on.
- This other hat, Max...

512
00:35:11,227 --> 00:35:12,728
may I wear it?

513
00:35:12,895 --> 00:35:14,980
- No, you may not.
- Why?

514
00:35:15,147 --> 00:35:19,443
Because that
is a Broadway producer's hat.

515
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:22,071
You don't get to wear
a Broadway producer's hat, son...

516
00:35:22,238 --> 00:35:24,573
until you're a Broadway producer.

517
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:26,575
And you're not
a Broadway producer until...

518
00:35:26,742 --> 00:35:30,162
I know, I know. Until I've produced
a show on Broadway.

519
00:35:30,329 --> 00:35:34,083
But I'm going to wear that hat,
and soon too, because...

520
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:37,294
<i>We're gonna be the producers</i>

521
00:35:37,461 --> 00:35:41,590
<i>Of a great big Broadway flop</i>

522
00:35:50,933 --> 00:35:54,520
<i>Ja, ja, my Lieblings.</i>

523
00:35:55,187 --> 00:35:57,106
Let me grab you here.

524
00:35:57,273 --> 00:35:59,400
We have work to do.

525
00:35:59,567 --> 00:36:03,779
Hilda, my darling. Here, I have
written an important message...

526
00:36:03,946 --> 00:36:07,908
which must reach
Ernst Schlongdorf.

527
00:36:08,075 --> 00:36:12,204
29 West Santiago Boulevard...

528
00:36:12,371 --> 00:36:14,790
Buenos Aires, Argentina.

529
00:36:14,957 --> 00:36:16,917
AQAP.

530
00:36:17,084 --> 00:36:18,753
As quick as possible.

531
00:36:19,962 --> 00:36:21,922
Good.

532
00:36:22,089 --> 00:36:25,634
Fly, Hilda. Fly!

533
00:36:26,177 --> 00:36:28,304
Hilda, where are you going?

534
00:36:28,471 --> 00:36:30,973
Argentina's that way!

535
00:36:31,891 --> 00:36:33,726
Okay, chow time.

536
00:36:39,732 --> 00:36:42,318
Yummy, yummy, yummy.
Goes right into your belly.

537
00:36:42,485 --> 00:36:45,488
It's just a hunch,
but I'm betting this is our man.

538
00:36:45,654 --> 00:36:50,076
Max, he's wearing a German helmet
and lederhosen.

539
00:36:50,242 --> 00:36:53,120
Yeah, I know. Don't notice them.
Don't notice anything.

540
00:36:53,287 --> 00:36:57,166
Always look straight ahead.
Remember, we need that play.

541
00:36:58,417 --> 00:37:00,669
Franz Liebkind?

542
00:37:00,836 --> 00:37:04,006
I was never a member
of the Nazi Party!

543
00:37:04,173 --> 00:37:05,716
I only followed orders.

544
00:37:05,883 --> 00:37:08,302
I had nothing to do with the war.

545
00:37:08,469 --> 00:37:10,513
I didn't even know
there was a war on.

546
00:37:11,347 --> 00:37:13,057
We lived in the back...

547
00:37:13,224 --> 00:37:14,892
right across from Switzerland.

548
00:37:15,059 --> 00:37:17,395
All we ever heard was yodelling.

549
00:37:24,485 --> 00:37:26,529
- Who are you?!
- Relax.

550
00:37:26,696 --> 00:37:28,864
Mr. Liebkind,
we're not from the government.

551
00:37:29,031 --> 00:37:31,367
We're producers,
Bialystock and Bloom...

552
00:37:31,534 --> 00:37:34,328
here to talk to you about your play.
- My play?

553
00:37:34,495 --> 00:37:37,206
<i>You mean Springtime for...</i>

554
00:37:37,665 --> 00:37:39,875
you-know-who?
- That's the one.

555
00:37:40,042 --> 00:37:43,212
- What about it?
- We love it. Don't we love it?

556
00:37:43,379 --> 00:37:46,799
- We think it's a masterpiece.
- We want to put it on Broadway.

557
00:37:46,966 --> 00:37:50,553
Broadway! Oh, joy of joys.

558
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,222
Dream of dreams. I can't believe it.

559
00:37:53,389 --> 00:37:55,891
- I must tell my birds.
- Tell your birds.

560
00:37:56,058 --> 00:37:59,729
Otto, Bertha, Heinz,
Heidi, Wolfgang...

561
00:37:59,895 --> 00:38:02,106
Adolf.

562
00:38:02,273 --> 00:38:03,774
Do you hear?

563
00:38:03,941 --> 00:38:07,403
We are finally going to clear
the Führer's name.

564
00:38:09,113 --> 00:38:10,823
Broadway!

565
00:38:11,907 --> 00:38:14,493
You know,
not many people know this...

566
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:18,414
but the Führer was a terrific dancer.
- Really?

567
00:38:18,581 --> 00:38:22,460
- We didn't know that, did we, Leo?
- No, no, we sure didn't.

568
00:38:22,626 --> 00:38:26,380
That's because you were taken in
by the BBC!

569
00:38:26,547 --> 00:38:29,675
Filthy British lies!

570
00:38:29,842 --> 00:38:34,430
But did they ever say a bad word
about Winston Churchill?

571
00:38:34,597 --> 00:38:36,932
Churchill!

572
00:38:37,725 --> 00:38:42,396
With his cigars, with his brandy
and his rotten paintings.

573
00:38:42,563 --> 00:38:44,106
Rotten!

574
00:38:44,273 --> 00:38:45,608
Hitler.

575
00:38:45,775 --> 00:38:47,485
There was a painter.

576
00:38:47,651 --> 00:38:50,613
He could paint an entire apartment
in one afternoon.

577
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:52,740
Two coats.

578
00:38:52,907 --> 00:38:55,242
Yes. Yes.

579
00:38:55,409 --> 00:38:57,745
Yes, of course he could,
Mr. Liebkind.

580
00:38:57,912 --> 00:39:00,748
And that is exactly why
we wanna produce your play.

581
00:39:00,915 --> 00:39:04,126
Show the world the true Hitler.
The Hitler you loved...

582
00:39:04,293 --> 00:39:07,963
the Hitler you knew,
the Hitler with a song in his heart.

583
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:11,217
Here, Franz Liebkind.
Sign here...

584
00:39:11,384 --> 00:39:13,636
and make your dream a reality.

585
00:39:14,804 --> 00:39:16,889
<i>- No.
- That's what "nein" means.</i>

586
00:39:17,056 --> 00:39:21,060
First you must prove to me
that you believe as I believe...

587
00:39:21,227 --> 00:39:25,815
by joining with me and singing and
dancing the Führer's favourite tune:

588
00:39:25,981 --> 00:39:27,983
" Der Guten Tag Hop-Clop."

589
00:39:28,818 --> 00:39:30,319
I know.

590
00:39:30,486 --> 00:39:32,822
- " Der Guten Tag Hop-Clop"?
- " Der Guten Tag Hop-Clop."

591
00:39:32,988 --> 00:39:35,032
No. I could never sing
the Führer's favourite...

592
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:36,409
Delighted. Delighted.

593
00:39:36,575 --> 00:39:39,245
Song.
- Shut up, he's almost ready to sign.

594
00:39:39,412 --> 00:39:42,832
All right. First you will roll up
your pants.

595
00:39:45,751 --> 00:39:47,670
- Rolling?
- Rolling.

596
00:39:47,837 --> 00:39:50,131
- Don't be stingy. Show some leg.
- Alrighty.

597
00:39:50,297 --> 00:39:51,590
- Good.
- Good.

598
00:39:51,757 --> 00:39:53,718
- Key of E?
- Is there any other?

599
00:39:58,013 --> 00:40:01,517
<i>Guten Tag hop hop
Guten Tag clop clop</i>

600
00:40:01,684 --> 00:40:05,312
<i>Ach, du lieber Und oh, boy</i>

601
00:40:05,479 --> 00:40:09,191
<i>Guten Tag clap clap
Guten Tag slap slap</i>

602
00:40:09,358 --> 00:40:11,986
<i>Ach, du lieber What a joy</i>

603
00:40:12,153 --> 00:40:16,615
<i>Oh, wir essen und fressen
Und tanzen und trinken</i>

604
00:40:16,782 --> 00:40:20,369
<i>Tanzen und trinken
Until we get stinkin'</i>

605
00:40:20,536 --> 00:40:23,247
<i>- Everybody!
- Guten Tag hop hop</i>

606
00:40:23,414 --> 00:40:24,915
<i>Guten Tag clop clop</i>

607
00:40:25,374 --> 00:40:28,919
<i>Guten Tag Mein lieber Schatz</i>

608
00:40:29,086 --> 00:40:32,631
<i>So we hop our hops
Und we clop our clops</i>

609
00:40:32,798 --> 00:40:37,219
<i>Und we drink our Schnaps
Till we platz</i>

610
00:40:37,386 --> 00:40:40,014
You will sway?

611
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:43,809
We will sway.

612
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:52,902
Follow me.

613
00:40:53,069 --> 00:40:54,945
Very good.

614
00:41:11,629 --> 00:41:13,756
Whatever you say.

615
00:41:14,382 --> 00:41:17,426
<i>This is a tricky one</i>

616
00:41:32,274 --> 00:41:36,112
Oh, the Hop-Clop.
It's been so long!

617
00:41:40,908 --> 00:41:43,411
Sort of a Nazi hoedown.

618
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,796
Gentlemen, you may
produce my play.

619
00:41:55,089 --> 00:41:56,590
Excellent. Excellent.

620
00:41:56,757 --> 00:41:59,093
Here we are. Here.

621
00:41:59,802 --> 00:42:03,097
But only if you take
the Siegfried Oath.

622
00:42:03,264 --> 00:42:05,141
The Siegfried Oath?
What's that?

623
00:42:05,307 --> 00:42:08,769
A pledge of eternal allegiance
to our beloved Führer.

624
00:42:08,936 --> 00:42:10,271
Never...

625
00:42:10,438 --> 00:42:12,565
took that oath before.

626
00:42:12,732 --> 00:42:16,193
<i>One for me, one for you,
und one for you.</i>

627
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:19,739
Never... Had one of those on before.
Thanks very much.

628
00:42:19,905 --> 00:42:22,241
- You're welcome.
- Nice colours.

629
00:42:22,408 --> 00:42:24,160
Oh, look, reversible.

630
00:42:24,326 --> 00:42:26,829
- Oh, yeah, you're right.
- Max.

631
00:42:26,996 --> 00:42:29,582
Max, we never
should have started this.

632
00:42:29,749 --> 00:42:31,917
I think we're getting in too deep.

633
00:42:32,084 --> 00:42:34,128
Too deep? This is nothing.

634
00:42:34,295 --> 00:42:37,006
I'll tell you when
we're getting in too deep.

635
00:42:37,173 --> 00:42:38,716
All right.

636
00:42:38,883 --> 00:42:41,427
First, you will raise
your right forefinger...

637
00:42:41,594 --> 00:42:43,679
<i>und repeat after me.</i>

638
00:42:43,846 --> 00:42:46,265
I solemnly swear...

639
00:42:46,432 --> 00:42:50,102
- I solemnly swear...
- I solemnly swear...

640
00:42:50,269 --> 00:42:53,356
to obey the sacred Siegfried Oath.

641
00:42:53,522 --> 00:42:57,526
To obey the sacred Siegfried Oath.
...to obey the sacred Siegfried Oath.

642
00:42:57,693 --> 00:42:59,528
<i>- Und...

643
00:42:59,695 --> 00:43:00,946

00:43:01,113 --> 00:43:03,366

00:43:08,913 --> 00:43:14,627
<i>dishonour the spirit und the memory

647
00:43:14,794 --> 00:43:18,005
<i>Dishonour the spirit und the...
...dishonour the spirit und the...</i>

648
00:43:18,172 --> 00:43:19,548
- Elizabeth?
- Elizabeth?

649
00:43:19,715 --> 00:43:23,677
<i>Ja, that was his middle name.</i>

650
00:43:23,844 --> 00:43:25,554
Not many people know this...

651
00:43:25,721 --> 00:43:32,061
but the Führer was descended
from a long line of English queens.

652
00:43:36,524 --> 00:43:38,609
Is that right?

653
00:43:39,819 --> 00:43:41,404
Yes.

654
00:43:41,946 --> 00:43:44,740
- Adolf Elizabeth Hitler.
- Adolf Elizabeth Hitler.

655
00:43:44,907 --> 00:43:48,327
- Good. Now I sign your contract.
- Excellent! Excellent.

656
00:43:48,494 --> 00:43:51,622
Here we are, sir.
Right here on the dotted line.

657
00:43:52,415 --> 00:43:54,250
There you are.
You shall never regret this.

658
00:43:54,417 --> 00:43:57,420
So thank you, Herr Liebkind.
Alrighty, then.

659
00:43:57,586 --> 00:43:59,505
Thank you.

660
00:44:02,591 --> 00:44:04,677
Let it go. Let it go.

661
00:44:04,844 --> 00:44:06,512
Halt!

662
00:44:06,679 --> 00:44:08,097
I forgot to tell you.

663
00:44:10,266 --> 00:44:13,769
The penalty for breaking
the Siegfried Oath...

664
00:44:13,936 --> 00:44:16,105
is dess.

665
00:44:16,272 --> 00:44:18,107
" Dess"?

666
00:44:18,274 --> 00:44:20,026
<i>Is that anything like "death"?</i>

667
00:44:20,192 --> 00:44:22,653
Yeth.

668
00:44:24,238 --> 00:44:25,948
Sorry to hear that. Don't worry...

669
00:44:26,115 --> 00:44:29,243
we'll iron out all these
thorny details over strudel.

670
00:44:29,410 --> 00:44:31,579
Ta-ta, big guy. Here we go...

671
00:44:35,291 --> 00:44:38,294
We're trapped! Trapped!

672
00:44:38,836 --> 00:44:40,296
Got it.

673
00:44:40,463 --> 00:44:42,298
Let's have lunch.

674
00:44:45,551 --> 00:44:47,928
What nice guys.

675
00:44:48,095 --> 00:44:49,555
Broadway.

676
00:44:49,722 --> 00:44:53,893
I haven't been so happy
since we crushed Poland.

677
00:44:57,355 --> 00:45:00,149
Hello, the living room of
renowned theatrical director...

678
00:45:00,316 --> 00:45:03,152
<i>Roger debris' elegant
Upper East Side townhouse...</i>

679
00:45:03,319 --> 00:45:06,739
on a sunny Tuesday
afternoon in June.

680
00:45:06,906 --> 00:45:09,450
Who may I say is calling?

681
00:45:10,076 --> 00:45:12,119
Listen, you broken-down
old queen...

682
00:45:12,286 --> 00:45:14,580
he was drunk, he was hot,
you got lucky.

683
00:45:14,747 --> 00:45:16,957
- Don't ever call here again.
- Who was that?

684
00:45:17,124 --> 00:45:19,210
Wrong number.

685
00:45:28,719 --> 00:45:30,971
Yes?

686
00:45:56,497 --> 00:45:58,708
Well, hi there.

687
00:45:58,874 --> 00:46:02,294
I'm Max Bialystock and this
is my associate, Mr. Bloom.

688
00:46:02,461 --> 00:46:05,214
We have an appointment
with renowned theatrical director...

689
00:46:05,381 --> 00:46:08,050
Roger debris.
- Ah, yes. Yes, please come in.

690
00:46:08,217 --> 00:46:10,970
- Please. Yes.
- Thank you.

691
00:46:21,188 --> 00:46:23,649
I am Carmen Ghia...

692
00:46:23,816 --> 00:46:27,194
Mr. debris'
common-law assistant.

693
00:46:27,361 --> 00:46:29,572
You are expected.

694
00:46:35,536 --> 00:46:40,583
May I take your hat, your coat
and your swastikas?

695
00:46:41,125 --> 00:46:44,253
Oh, these. We... We...

696
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:48,174
We just came from this big rally.
Everybody was wearing them.

697
00:46:49,675 --> 00:46:52,386
- You didn't tell me we had those on?
- I didn't notice them.

698
00:46:52,553 --> 00:46:58,267
- You told me to look straight ahead.
- Yes, all right. Let's not fight. Okay?

699
00:47:02,146 --> 00:47:04,607
Oh, Roger.

700
00:47:04,774 --> 00:47:07,777
We're not alone.

701
00:47:18,287 --> 00:47:22,458
Here's Roger.

702
00:47:27,213 --> 00:47:31,217
- Max, he's wearing a dress.
- No kidding.

703
00:47:31,384 --> 00:47:33,386
Roger, good to see you again.

704
00:47:33,552 --> 00:47:36,722
Messrs. Bialystock and Bloom,
I presume?

705
00:47:36,889 --> 00:47:38,808
Forgive the pun.

706
00:47:40,851 --> 00:47:42,978
- What pun?
- Shut up. He thinks he's witty.

707
00:47:43,145 --> 00:47:47,817
Roger, may I say you look gorgeous.
Absolutely gorgeous.

708
00:47:49,235 --> 00:47:52,029
<i>By the way, Max, darling,
we loved Funny Boy, didn't we?</i>

709
00:47:52,196 --> 00:47:53,322
Worshipped it.

710
00:47:53,489 --> 00:47:55,825
<i>To be or not to be
You mean a lot to me</i>

711
00:47:55,991 --> 00:47:58,285
- Showstopper!
- Fabulous.

712
00:47:59,161 --> 00:48:02,289
Oh, dear. Your Mr. Bloom
is staring at my gown.

713
00:48:03,082 --> 00:48:05,000
- Well, I was...
- I should explain.

714
00:48:05,167 --> 00:48:09,004
I'm going to the Choreographers' Ball.
There is a prize for best costume.

715
00:48:09,171 --> 00:48:13,134
- We always win.
- I'm not so sure about this year.

716
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:16,387
I'm supposed to be
the Grand Duchess Anastasia...

717
00:48:16,554 --> 00:48:19,849
but I think I look more like
the Chrysler Building.

718
00:48:21,142 --> 00:48:25,021
Well, as far as I'm concerned, without
your wig on, you're only half dressed.

719
00:48:25,187 --> 00:48:28,482
Well, then,
why don't you go and get it...

720
00:48:28,649 --> 00:48:32,236
oh, Wicked Witch of the West.

721
00:48:35,072 --> 00:48:36,741
If your intention...

722
00:48:36,907 --> 00:48:41,704
was to shoot an arrow
through my heart...

723
00:48:43,039 --> 00:48:45,166
bull's-eye!

724
00:48:49,045 --> 00:48:52,590
Oh, Roger, let's face it,
that building is you.

725
00:48:52,757 --> 00:48:55,551
Listen, I know we sent it to you
only this morning...

726
00:48:55,718 --> 00:48:57,845
<i>but did you read
Springtime for Hitler?</i>

727
00:48:58,012 --> 00:49:00,306
Read it? I devoured it.

728
00:49:00,473 --> 00:49:02,850
And I find it remarkable.
Remarkable!

729
00:49:03,017 --> 00:49:06,979
I feel it is a very important piece,
drenched with historical goodies.

730
00:49:07,146 --> 00:49:10,399
I, for one, for instance,
never realized that the Third Reich...

731
00:49:10,566 --> 00:49:12,651
meant Germany.

732
00:49:12,818 --> 00:49:15,237
Yeah, how about that.
Then you'll do it?

733
00:49:15,404 --> 00:49:19,617
Do it? Of course not. It's not my
kind of thing. I mean, Max, please.

734
00:49:19,784 --> 00:49:23,954
World War II?
Too dark, too depressing.

735
00:49:24,121 --> 00:49:26,999
<i>The theatre's so obsessed
With dramas so depressed</i>

736
00:49:27,166 --> 00:49:30,211
<i>It's hard to sell a tick et on Broadway</i>

737
00:49:30,378 --> 00:49:33,881
<i>Shows should be more pretty
Shows should be more witty</i>

738
00:49:34,048 --> 00:49:35,674
<i>Shows should be more</i>

739
00:49:35,841 --> 00:49:38,135
<i>What's the word?</i>

740
00:49:38,302 --> 00:49:41,222
- Gay?
- Exactly.

741
00:49:41,389 --> 00:49:45,226
<i>No matter what you do on the stage</i>

742
00:49:45,393 --> 00:49:48,729
<i>Keep it light, keep it bright
Keep it gay</i>

743
00:49:48,896 --> 00:49:52,692
<i>Whether it's murder
Mayhem or rage</i>

744
00:49:52,858 --> 00:49:57,113
<i>Don't complain, it's a pain
Keep it gay</i>

745
00:49:57,279 --> 00:50:00,616
<i>People want laughter
When they see a show</i>

746
00:50:00,783 --> 00:50:04,120
<i>The last thing they're after is
A litany of woe</i>

747
00:50:04,286 --> 00:50:08,124
<i>A happy ending
Will pep up your play</i>

748
00:50:08,290 --> 00:50:10,000
<i>Oedipus won't bomb</i>

749
00:50:10,167 --> 00:50:11,836
<i>If he winds up with Mom</i>

750
00:50:12,002 --> 00:50:13,713
<i>- Keep it gay

751
00:50:13,879 --> 00:50:16,132
<i>- Keep it gay
- Keep it gay</i>

752
00:50:16,298 --> 00:50:17,633
Couldn't agree more.

753
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,468
And you have our blessings,
Roger...

754
00:50:19,635 --> 00:50:23,639
<i>to make Springtime for Hitler just
as gay as anyone could possibly want.</i>

755
00:50:23,806 --> 00:50:25,307
So come on, do it for us. Please.

756
00:50:25,474 --> 00:50:28,602
I'm sorry, Max.
It's simply not my cup of tea.

757
00:50:28,769 --> 00:50:31,397
Still, fair is fair.

758
00:50:31,564 --> 00:50:33,983
I should ask my production team
what they think.

759
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:35,693
Your production team,
who are they?

760
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:37,987
You'll see. They all live here.

761
00:50:38,154 --> 00:50:41,490
Guys! Come say hello
to Bialystock and Bloom!

762
00:50:41,657 --> 00:50:44,035
This is my set designer, Brian.

763
00:50:44,201 --> 00:50:45,244
Hello.

764
00:50:45,411 --> 00:50:48,622
<i>Keep it mad, keep it glad
Keep it gay</i>

765
00:50:48,789 --> 00:50:52,668
- Here's my costume designer, Kevin.
- Hello.

766
00:50:52,835 --> 00:50:56,589
<i>Keep it happy, keep it snappy
Keep it gay</i>

767
00:50:56,756 --> 00:51:00,384
<i>We're clever, creative
It's our job to see</i>

768
00:51:00,551 --> 00:51:04,096
<i>That everything's perfect
For Mr. debris</i>

769
00:51:04,263 --> 00:51:06,474
Scott, my choreographer.

770
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,351
Hi there.

771
00:51:24,533 --> 00:51:27,411
And, finally, last and least...

772
00:51:27,578 --> 00:51:31,540
my lighting designer,

Roger, actually,
I think your gown is very stunning.

What is that enchanting

Me? I'm not wearing any cologne.

You mean that smell is you?

788

Oh, God.

789

If I could bottle you, I'd shove you

Oh, Max.
Max, we never should've started this.

- I think we're getting in too deep.
- Too deep? This is nothing.

you've always been associated with...

Dare I say it?... frivolous musicals.

802
00:53:22,485 --> 00:53:24,487
You're right.
I've often felt as though...

803
00:53:24,653 --> 00:53:27,490
I've been throwing my life away
on silly entertainments.

804

couldn't do Springtime for Hitler.</i>

- Why not? Think of the respect.
- No.

809
00:53:40,836 --> 00:53:42,505
- Think of the prestige.
- No, no, no.

810
00:53:42,671 --> 00:53:44,173

- He's having a stroke.
- What?

814
00:53:52,473 --> 00:53:54,684
- Of genius!
- I see it at last.

815

01:00:03,636 --> 01:00:07,807
<i>When you got it Let it hang out</i>

929
01:00:07,973 --> 01:00:09,975
- Remember when Ulla dance?
- Yeah.

930
01:00:10,142 --> 01:00:11,394
Ulla dance again.

931
01:00:12,061 --> 01:00:15,231
Ulla dance again!

932
01:00:31,455 --> 01:00:35,334
<i>When I was just a little girl
In Sweden</i>

933
01:00:35,501 --> 01:00:39,422
<i>My thoughtful mother
Gave me this advice</i>

934
01:00:39,588 --> 01:00:43,426
<i>If nature blesses you
From top to bottom</i>

935
01:00:43,592 --> 01:00:46,512
<i>Show that top to bottom
Don't think twice</i>

936
01:00:46,679 --> 01:00:48,848
Now Ulla belt.

937
01:00:49,015 --> 01:00:52,935
<i>Don't think twice!</i>

938
01:00:53,102 --> 01:00:55,396
<i>When you got it</i>

939
01:00:55,563 --> 01:00:57,231
<i>Share it</i>

940
01:00:57,398 --> 01:01:01,318
<i>Let the public feast
Upon your charms</i>

941
01:01:01,485 --> 01:01:05,197
<i>People say that being prim
Is proper</i>

942
01:01:05,364 --> 01:01:08,701
<i>But every showgirl knows
That prim will stop her</i>

943
01:01:08,868 --> 01:01:11,245
<i>When you got it</i>

944
01:01:11,412 --> 01:01:13,205
<i>Give it</i>

945
01:01:13,372 --> 01:01:18,377
<i>Don't be selfish
Give it all away</i>

946
01:01:23,132 --> 01:01:24,800
<i>Don't be shy Be bold and cute</i>

947
01:01:24,967 --> 01:01:26,802
<i>Show the boys your birthday suit</i>

948
01:01:26,969 --> 01:01:30,139
<i>When you got it</i>

949
01:01:30,931 --> 01:01:34,101
<i>If you got it</i>

950
01:01:34,894 --> 01:01:38,022
<i>Once you got it</i>

951
01:01:38,189 --> 01:01:40,483
<i>Shout out</i>

952
01:01:42,902 --> 01:01:43,402
<i>Hooray!</i>

953
01:01:54,330 --> 01:01:55,915
Okey-dokey.

954
01:01:56,082 --> 01:01:57,333
You like it?

955
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:59,835
Like... Like it?

956
01:02:00,002 --> 01:02:03,589
I want you to know, my dear,
that even though we're sitting down...

957
01:02:03,756 --> 01:02:07,843
we're giving you
a standing ovation.

958
01:02:12,598 --> 01:02:15,351
She's in the show.

959
01:02:15,518 --> 01:02:20,523
Wait, Max. Max, we don't even know
if there's a part for her in the show.

960
01:02:20,690 --> 01:02:23,693
Would you excuse us, my dear?

961
01:02:23,859 --> 01:02:25,695
Nonsense, Bloom.

962
01:02:25,861 --> 01:02:27,863
Bloom,
do I have to teach you everything?

963
01:02:28,030 --> 01:02:30,491
There is always a part
for the producer's girlfriend.

964
01:02:30,658 --> 01:02:33,369
But we don't even know
when we're starting rehearsal yet.

965
01:02:33,536 --> 01:02:37,581
So what? So what?
We're producers, aren't we?

966
01:02:37,748 --> 01:02:40,710
So until she goes into the show,
she can work for us here.

967
01:02:40,876 --> 01:02:45,715
<i>Because we need...
Nay, deserve to have ourselves a...</i>

968
01:02:47,049 --> 01:02:51,137
<i>Deserve to have ourselves a gorgeous
Swedish secretary/receptionist.</i>

969
01:02:51,303 --> 01:02:55,224
But, Max, a secretary who doesn't
speak English? What will people say?

970
01:02:55,391 --> 01:02:57,226
They'll say:

971
01:02:59,311 --> 01:03:01,981
Offer her the job, please?

972
01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:04,358
Just a moment, miss.

973
01:03:05,901 --> 01:03:07,528
We might have a position for you.

974
01:03:07,695 --> 01:03:11,699
As a matter of fact, we might
have several positions for you.

975
01:03:11,866 --> 01:03:13,409
Until the show gets going...

976
01:03:13,576 --> 01:03:18,080
we can offer you a job here
as a secretary/receptionist.

977
01:03:18,247 --> 01:03:21,667
Secretary/receptionist?

978
01:03:21,834 --> 01:03:24,420
Okey/dokey!

979
01:03:24,587 --> 01:03:25,838
I can do that.

980
01:03:27,882 --> 01:03:30,301
Answer telephone.

981
01:03:30,468 --> 01:03:32,511
Bialystock and Bloom.

982
01:03:32,678 --> 01:03:34,347
Bialystock and Bloom.

983
01:03:34,513 --> 01:03:35,806
Smart as a whip.

984
01:03:35,973 --> 01:03:38,142
You're hired!

985
01:03:43,022 --> 01:03:46,776
Well... Well, all right. If he says so,
I don't have a...

986
01:03:49,028 --> 01:03:51,322
Secretary/receptionist.

987
01:03:51,489 --> 01:03:53,949
And maybe you can tidy up
around here a little bit too.

988
01:03:54,116 --> 01:03:56,035
Tidy up? Tidy up.

989
01:03:56,202 --> 01:03:58,579
Such a funny word.
What means "tidy up"?

990
01:03:58,746 --> 01:04:01,457
- You know, clean.
- Make look nice.

991
01:04:01,624 --> 01:04:05,127
- Oh, yeah. Ulla can make tidy up.
- Very good.

992
01:04:05,294 --> 01:04:07,463
What time can you be here
in the morning?

993
01:04:07,630 --> 01:04:10,925
Well, Ulla wake up every morning,
5 a. m.

994
01:04:11,092 --> 01:04:13,594
From 5 to 7, Ulla like to exercise.

995
01:04:13,761 --> 01:04:16,931
From to 7 to 8,
Ulla like to take long shower.

996
01:04:17,098 --> 01:04:21,185
From to 8 to 9, Ulla like
to have big Swedish breakfast.

997
01:04:21,352 --> 01:04:23,312
Many different herrings.

998
01:04:23,479 --> 01:04:27,316
From to 9 to 11, Ulla like to practice
her singing and her dancing.

999
01:04:27,483 --> 01:04:31,112
And at 11, Ulla like to have sex.

1000
01:04:31,278 --> 01:04:33,656
What time should I get here?

1001
01:04:33,823 --> 01:04:34,990
- Eleven.
- Eleven.

1002
01:04:35,157 --> 01:04:37,910
Good. Ulla will come at 11.

1003
01:04:38,077 --> 01:04:40,913
Ulla will come at 11.

1004
01:04:49,964 --> 01:04:52,675
God bless America!

1005
01:04:55,052 --> 01:04:57,805
God bless Sweden.

1006
01:04:58,139 --> 01:05:01,684
Oh, Max. Max, she's fantastic.

1007
01:05:01,851 --> 01:05:04,478
The most beautiful girl
I've ever seen.

1008
01:05:04,645 --> 01:05:06,272
I've never felt this way before.

1009
01:05:06,439 --> 01:05:09,608
It's like a volcano erupting
inside of me...

1010
01:05:09,775 --> 01:05:14,864
like hot lava rising higher
and higher and...

1011
01:05:15,031 --> 01:05:16,991
What is that, Max?

1012
01:05:17,158 --> 01:05:19,326
What is it?

1013
01:05:21,037 --> 01:05:24,749
It's called an erection.
It's either that or malaria.

1014
01:05:25,541 --> 01:05:27,877
But don't worry,
they have shots for everything now.

1015
01:05:28,002 --> 01:05:29,563
Come here,
I want to show you something.

1016
01:05:31,756 --> 01:05:33,549
- What do you see?
- Nothing.

1017
01:05:33,716 --> 01:05:37,136
Exactly. But now that we've got
our sure-fire flop...

1018
01:05:37,303 --> 01:05:40,639
it's gonna be our job
to fill that safe with 2 million dollars.

1019
01:05:40,806 --> 01:05:44,643
Two million?
Gee, how much do we put in?

1020
01:05:55,071 --> 01:05:58,866
How much...?
How much do we put in?

1021
01:05:59,033 --> 01:06:00,785
Bloom...

1022
01:06:00,951 --> 01:06:04,372
the two cardinal rules
of being a Broadway producer...

1023
01:06:04,538 --> 01:06:07,917
are one, never put
your own money in the show.

1024
01:06:08,084 --> 01:06:09,335
And two?

1025
01:06:09,502 --> 01:06:15,174
Never put your own money
in the show!

1026
01:06:16,759 --> 01:06:18,177
- Get it?
- Got it.

1027
01:06:18,344 --> 01:06:20,388
- Good.
- So how do we raise the money?

1028
01:06:20,554 --> 01:06:23,265
How? I'll tell you how.

1029
01:06:24,517 --> 01:06:25,935
From my investors.

1030
01:06:26,102 --> 01:06:27,978
Hundreds of little old ladies...

1031
01:06:28,145 --> 01:06:33,275
all looking to Max Bialystock for one
last thrill on their way to the cemetery.

1032
01:06:33,442 --> 01:06:37,321
So in the days to come, Bloom,
you shall see very little of me.

1033
01:06:37,488 --> 01:06:39,865
And right now,
I'd like to see very little of you.

1034
01:06:40,032 --> 01:06:42,076
Scram while I get myself ready.

1035
01:06:42,243 --> 01:06:46,122
For Max Bialystock
is about to launch himself...

1036
01:06:46,288 --> 01:06:48,749
into little-old-lady land.

1037
01:06:50,126 --> 01:06:53,170
<i>The time has come</i>

1038
01:06:53,337 --> 01:06:57,758
<i>To be a lover from the Argentine</i>

1039
01:06:57,925 --> 01:07:02,471
<i>To slick my hair down
With brilliantine</i>

1040
01:07:02,638 --> 01:07:09,145
<i>And gargle heavily
With Listerine</i>

1041
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:18,070
<i>It's time for Max</i>

1042
01:07:18,279 --> 01:07:23,242
<i>To put his backers on their backs</i>

1043
01:07:23,409 --> 01:07:28,831
<i>And thrill them with amazing acts</i>

1044
01:07:28,998 --> 01:07:31,751
<i>Those aging nymphomaniacs</i>

1045
01:07:41,552 --> 01:07:45,139
<i>They were helpless
They were hopeless</i>

1046
01:07:45,306 --> 01:07:48,809
<i>Then along came Bialy</i>

1047
01:07:48,976 --> 01:07:52,646
<i>They were joyless
They were boy-less</i>

1048
01:07:52,813 --> 01:07:56,233
<i>Then along came Bialy</i>

1049
01:07:56,442 --> 01:08:00,112
<i>They're my angels
I'm their devil</i>

1050
01:08:00,279 --> 01:08:03,949
<i>And I keep those embers aglow</i>

1051
01:08:04,158 --> 01:08:07,745
<i>When I woos 'em
I can't lose 'em</i>

1052
01:08:07,912 --> 01:08:10,039
<i>'Cause I cast my spell
And they start yellin'</i>

1053
01:08:10,206 --> 01:08:11,582
<i>"Fire down below!"</i>

1054
01:08:11,749 --> 01:08:15,252
<i>So romantic They were frantic</i>

1055
01:08:15,461 --> 01:08:19,298
<i>Then their prayers were heard
Up above</i>

1056
01:08:19,465 --> 01:08:21,175
<i>Heaven sent them</i>

1057
01:08:21,342 --> 01:08:23,052
<i>Their Bialy</i>

1058
01:08:23,219 --> 01:08:29,934
<i>I'm the celebration of love</i>

1059
01:08:37,274 --> 01:08:40,194
<i>Who is it? Who is it?</i>

1060
01:08:40,361 --> 01:08:42,154
It's Max Bialystock.

1061
01:08:46,325 --> 01:08:48,202
Maxy.

1062
01:10:05,946 --> 01:10:07,281
Fire down below!

1063
01:10:07,448 --> 01:10:10,201
<i>We were listing We were sinking</i>

1064
01:10:10,368 --> 01:10:13,788
<i>Then along came Bialy</i>

1065
01:10:13,954 --> 01:10:17,041
<i>We were desperate
We were drinking</i>

1066
01:10:17,249 --> 01:10:20,586
<i>- Then along came Bialy
- Who's your daddy?</i>

1067
01:10:20,795 --> 01:10:23,964
<i>So romantic We were frantic</i>

1068
01:10:24,131 --> 01:10:27,551
<i>Then our prayers were heard
Up above</i>

1069
01:10:27,718 --> 01:10:29,095
<i>It's Bialy</i>

1070
01:10:29,261 --> 01:10:30,763
<i>Hey, Bialy</i>

1071
01:10:30,930 --> 01:10:32,890
<i>He's the culmination</i>

1072
01:10:33,057 --> 01:10:34,600
<i>The restoration</i>

1073
01:10:34,767 --> 01:10:36,310
<i>The consummation</i>

1074
01:10:36,477 --> 01:10:37,728
<i>The titillation</i>

1075
01:10:37,937 --> 01:10:39,397
<i>Ejaculation</i>

1076
01:10:39,563 --> 01:10:44,360
<i>He's the celebration of love</i>

1077
01:11:01,335 --> 01:11:03,379
Thank you.

1078
01:11:14,390 --> 01:11:16,517
Bloom! Bloom!

1079
01:11:16,684 --> 01:11:18,811
What, Max? What?

1080
01:11:18,978 --> 01:11:21,689
I've done it. I've done it,
I've raised the 2 million.

1081
01:11:21,856 --> 01:11:24,734
Now all we have to do is put on
the biggest flop in history.

1082
01:11:24,900 --> 01:11:27,194
That's great!

1083
01:11:37,538 --> 01:11:38,789
<i>We can't miss</i>

1084
01:12:00,311 --> 01:12:03,147
I gotta make the next payment
on the theatre by 3:00 or else...

1085
01:12:03,314 --> 01:12:04,565
Sorry, wrong office.

1086
01:12:04,774 --> 01:12:06,734
Bialystock. Bloom.

1087
01:12:07,860 --> 01:12:09,320
Max. Leo.

1088
01:12:24,752 --> 01:12:26,962
- Ulla?
- Ulla?

1089
01:12:27,546 --> 01:12:29,090
What happened to the office?

1090
01:12:29,256 --> 01:12:32,259
Like you tell Ulla, "tidy up."

1091
01:12:32,426 --> 01:12:34,720
Tidy "oop"?

1092
01:12:34,929 --> 01:12:36,889
How did you find the time
to do all this?

1093
01:12:37,098 --> 01:12:40,518
- I skip lunch.
- Of course you did.

1094
01:12:40,726 --> 01:12:43,479
- Very nice.
- She skipped lunch.

1095
01:12:43,646 --> 01:12:45,439
Almost 3.
That payment to the Shuberts.

1096
01:12:45,606 --> 01:12:47,149
I'll get the cash from the safe.

1097
01:12:47,316 --> 01:12:49,443
You make sure
all those contracts are signed.

1098
01:12:49,610 --> 01:12:50,945
Yes, Max.

1099
01:12:52,697 --> 01:12:54,990
She painted over the numbers.

1100
01:13:08,921 --> 01:13:10,965
Hello, boys.

1101
01:13:13,092 --> 01:13:15,928
Nobody knows
what I went through to get you.

1102
01:13:16,095 --> 01:13:17,555
Ulla knows.

1103
01:13:17,763 --> 01:13:21,976
You had to shtupp
every little old lady in New York.

1104
01:13:23,978 --> 01:13:26,272
That's right. That's right.

1105
01:13:27,064 --> 01:13:30,067
And I've still got
the denture bites to prove it.

1106
01:13:31,569 --> 01:13:35,156
Work, work, work. Work, work, work.

1107
01:13:36,657 --> 01:13:41,620
So, Mr. Bloom.

1108
01:13:41,829 --> 01:13:44,123
We are all alone.

1109
01:13:44,707 --> 01:13:47,251
Yes, we are, aren't we?

1110
01:13:53,007 --> 01:13:56,427
Why Bloom go so far camera right?

1111
01:13:57,345 --> 01:14:00,056
Bloom no like Ulla?

1112
01:14:00,264 --> 01:14:02,808
Ulla like Bloom.

1113
01:14:03,225 --> 01:14:05,436
Bloom like Ulla, all right.

1114
01:14:05,644 --> 01:14:08,647
- Maybe a little too much.
- Good.

1115
01:14:08,856 --> 01:14:10,983
I'm glad.

1116
01:14:12,860 --> 01:14:14,987
Why Bloom need blue blanket?

1117
01:14:15,154 --> 01:14:16,864
Oh, it's not important.

1118
01:14:17,031 --> 01:14:19,075
It's just a minor compulsion.
It's that I've...

1119
01:14:19,241 --> 01:14:22,078
I've had it ever since
I was a baby, and I...

1120
01:14:22,244 --> 01:14:25,164
You're a little too close.

1121
01:14:26,624 --> 01:14:31,170
<i>The urge to merge
Can rob us of our senses</i>

1122
01:14:31,379 --> 01:14:36,092
<i>The need to breed
Can make a man a drone</i>

1123
01:14:36,258 --> 01:14:40,721
<i>We must be on alert
With our defences</i>

1124
01:14:40,888 --> 01:14:44,225
<i>For every skirt will test</i>

1125
01:14:46,018 --> 01:14:49,188
<i>Testosterone</i>

1126
01:14:49,397 --> 01:14:53,234
<i>So knowing this
I severed all connection</i>

1127
01:14:53,401 --> 01:14:56,821
<i>With any creature
Sporting silk or lace</i>

1128
01:14:56,987 --> 01:15:01,367
<i>I was firmly headed
In the right direction</i>

1129
01:15:01,575 --> 01:15:05,788
<i>When suddenly I stumbled on</i>

1130
01:15:05,996 --> 01:15:09,417
<i>That face</i>

1131
01:15:11,001 --> 01:15:13,212
<i>That face That face</i>

1132
01:15:13,379 --> 01:15:15,506
<i>That dangerous face</i>

01:15:15,673 --> 01:15:19,885
<i>I mustn't be unwise</i>

1134
01:15:20,094 --> 01:15:22,221
<i>Those lips That nose</i>

1135
01:15:22,430 --> 01:15:24,557
<i>Those eyes</i>

1136
01:15:24,765 --> 01:15:29,061
<i>Could lead to my demise</i>

1137
01:15:29,228 --> 01:15:31,272
<i>That face That face</i>

1138
01:15:31,439 --> 01:15:33,482
<i>That marvellous face</i>

1139
01:15:33,649 --> 01:15:37,945
<i>I never should begin</i>

1140
01:15:38,112 --> 01:15:40,239
<i>Those cheeks That neck</i>

1141
01:15:40,406 --> 01:15:42,450
<i>That chin</i>

1142
01:15:42,616 --> 01:15:46,912
<i>Will surely do me in</i>

1143
01:15:47,121 --> 01:15:49,248
<i>I must be smart
And hide my heart</i>

1144
01:15:49,457 --> 01:15:51,667
<i>If she's within a mile</i>

1145
01:15:51,834 --> 01:15:54,670
<i>If I don't duck I'm out of luck</i>

1146
01:15:54,837 --> 01:15:59,967
<i>She'd kill me with her smile</i>

1147
01:16:05,222 --> 01:16:07,266
<i>That face That face</i>

1148

Bloom help Ulla down?

1155
01:16:26,994 --> 01:16:30,831
All right. Bloom help Ulla down.

We must have some order here.

Will all the dancing Hitlers
please wait off-stage right...

1177
01:20:35,451 --> 01:20:39,038
and all the singing Hitlers
off-stage left.

1178
01:20:39,663 --> 01:20:41,374
Get that way.

This way, please.
This way, please.

1250
01:24:51,791 --> 01:24:54,001
Take your seats.

1251
01:24:58,005 --> 01:25:00,466
Good evening, sir. Nice to see you.

1252
01:25:00,633 --> 01:25:03,177
- Enjoy the show.
- Thank you.

1253
01:25:09,350 --> 01:25:10,893
- Oh, Mr. Bloom.
- Oh, Mr. Bloom.

1254
01:25:11,060 --> 01:25:14,480
- You look so handsome.
- Thank you.

1255
01:25:15,272 --> 01:25:16,816
Leo!

1256
01:25:18,818 --> 01:25:21,737
Leo, who said
you could wear that hat?

1257
01:25:21,946 --> 01:25:25,533
Nobody, Max. But I thought now that
I'm the producer of a Broadway show...

1258
01:25:25,741 --> 01:25:27,368
- Has the curtain gone up yet?
- No.

1259
01:25:27,743 --> 01:25:29,453
- Has the curtain come down yet?
- No.

1260
01:25:29,662 --> 01:25:32,039
Then you're not a producer yet.
Give me that hat.

1261
01:25:32,206 --> 01:25:34,750
Mr. Bloom! Leo.

1262
01:25:34,959 --> 01:25:37,586
Your tie is all askew.

1263
01:25:37,753 --> 01:25:40,131
Askew. Oh, thank you, Ulla.

1264
01:25:40,297 --> 01:25:42,425
Have a good show.

1265
01:25:49,181 --> 01:25:50,891
Roll them in the aisles.

1266
01:25:51,100 --> 01:25:52,476
Okey-dokey.

1267
01:25:52,643 --> 01:25:54,270
I will try to.

1268
01:25:54,478 --> 01:25:57,481
But there's just so many of them.

1269
01:26:00,776 --> 01:26:03,779
Gee, I thought we were partners,
sharing everything 50-50.

1270
01:26:03,946 --> 01:26:07,199
Now I'm out in the cold, and you two
are busy askewing each other.

1271
01:26:07,408 --> 01:26:08,868
Askewing? Never, Max.

1272
01:26:09,076 --> 01:26:12,413
Hugs and kisses, yes,
but that's as far as I go.

1273
01:26:21,672 --> 01:26:25,259
Gunter, you will pick me up back here
right after the curtain.

1274
01:26:29,263 --> 01:26:31,390
Oh, God, will they love us?
Will they hate us?

1275
01:26:31,599 --> 01:26:32,767
The suspense is killing me.

1276
01:26:32,975 --> 01:26:36,312
I know.
I feel like I'm going into labour.

wish everybody good luck.

1279

- What? What did you say?
- Bite your tongue.

1280
01:26:51,452 --> 01:26:53,829
Well, what's the matter?
All I said was "good luck."

1281
01:26:54,038 --> 01:26:57,291
- He said it again.
- Hasn't anyone ever told you?

Curtain going up in five minutes.

1315
01:28:24,045 --> 01:28:26,005
I'm late. I must run!

1316
01:28:26,380 --> 01:28:28,507
- Break a leg!
- Break a leg!

1317
01:28:45,149 --> 01:28:46,859
Franz, what happened?

1318
01:28:47,026 --> 01:28:50,029
I broke my leg.

1319
01:28:50,321 --> 01:28:54,158
Now we'll have to cancel the show
and give everyone their money back.

1320
01:28:54,408 --> 01:28:55,910
Money back?

1321
01:28:56,077 --> 01:28:57,244
Money back?

1322
01:28:57,453 --> 01:28:58,704
Money back.

1323
01:28:58,871 --> 01:29:00,831
Don't ever say that again.
Money back?

1324
01:29:00,998 --> 01:29:02,708
Never.
We gotta think of something else.

1325
01:29:02,917 --> 01:29:06,420
But Franz plays Hitler, Max,
and he has no understudy.

1326
01:29:06,587 --> 01:29:09,423
You're right. What are we gonna do?
There must be a way out.

1327
01:29:09,590 --> 01:29:12,301
If I could only think of something.
Some way. Some...

1328
01:29:12,677 --> 01:29:15,596
Hold it. I got it.
Roger, you. You could play Hitler.

1329
01:29:15,763 --> 01:29:17,223
You know every line in the show.

1330
01:29:17,390 --> 01:29:21,394
I've seen you at rehearsal, always
moving your lips along with the actors.

1331
01:29:21,560 --> 01:29:24,271
It's an embarrassing habit.
I'm trying to break myself of it.

1332
01:29:24,438 --> 01:29:27,108
But me play Hitler? No!
There's no way I could go on tonight.

1333
01:29:27,274 --> 01:29:29,568
I don't have the strength.
I don't have the courage.

1334
01:29:29,777 --> 01:29:31,737
I can't do it! I can't do it!
I can't do it!

1335
01:29:31,946 --> 01:29:33,906
- Wow, that hurt.
- Roger.

1336
01:29:34,115 --> 01:29:35,741
Listen to me.

1337
01:29:36,325 --> 01:29:37,576
You can do it.

1338
01:29:37,743 --> 01:29:39,870
You know you can do it,
and I know you can do it.

1339
01:29:40,037 --> 01:29:42,415
You've been waiting all your lifetime
for this chance.

1340
01:29:42,623 --> 01:29:45,292
And I'm not gonna let you
pass it up.

1341
01:29:46,460 --> 01:29:50,923
You're going out there a silly,
hysterical, screaming queen.

1342
01:29:51,132 --> 01:29:54,093
But you're coming back
a great big...

1344
01:29:59,306 --> 01:30:01,100
All right. You're right.

1345
01:30:01,308 --> 01:30:03,602
I'll do it! By God, I'll do it!

1346
01:30:03,811 --> 01:30:07,064
I've got to get into makeup.
Quick, get Franz's Hitler moustache.

1347
01:30:07,231 --> 01:30:11,277
And, oh! My lucky
Gloria Swanson mole.

1348
01:30:12,319 --> 01:30:13,863
Got it!

1349

1351
01:30:36,344 --> 01:30:38,971
- Max.
- What?

1352
01:30:39,180 --> 01:30:41,057
This is it!

1353
01:30:42,641 --> 01:30:46,062

1412

1416
01:36:08,509 --> 01:36:10,469
<i>Hitched up my pants</i>

1417
01:36:10,678 --> 01:36:12,972

"A surprise smash."

No way out.

" It was shocking,
outrageous, insulting...

No way out!

1452
01:39:44,892 --> 01:39:46,769
How could this happen?

1453
01:39:46,977 --> 01:39:51,190
We picked the wrong play,
the wrong director, the wrong cast.

1454
01:39:51,399 --> 01:39:53,859
Where did we go right?

" Congratulations."

01:40:08,124 --> 01:40:10,584
- What are you doing?
- I'm taking these books...

1457
01:40:10,751 --> 01:40:12,461
and I'm leaving.

1458
01:40:12,670 --> 01:40:15,381
Don't try and stop me.
I've made up my mind.

1459
01:40:15,548 --> 01:40:17,174
Wait. Where do you think
you're going?

1460
01:40:17,383 --> 01:40:19,427
I'm turning myself in.
It's the only way.

1461
01:40:19,635 --> 01:40:21,262
I'm going to play ball with the IRS.

1462
01:40:21,429 --> 01:40:23,305
I'm going to cooperate
with the authorities.

1463
01:40:23,514 --> 01:40:26,308
They'll reduce my sentence,
there's time off for good behaviour.

1464
01:40:26,475 --> 01:40:28,352
Maybe I'll get a job
in the prison library.

1465
01:40:28,561 --> 01:40:31,313
Please keep in touch.
It's been very nice working with you.

1466
01:40:32,356 --> 01:40:36,402
Leo. Leo. Leo.

1467
01:40:36,944 --> 01:40:38,904
Frightened Leo. Nervous Leo, relax.

1468
01:40:39,113 --> 01:40:40,740
Take it easy, all right?

1469
01:40:40,906 --> 01:40:43,200
You're overwrought.
You don't know what you're doing.

1470
01:40:43,409 --> 01:40:44,744
You're acting out of panic.

1471
01:40:44,910 --> 01:40:47,288
Give me those frigging books!
Give me!

1472
01:40:47,496 --> 01:40:51,625
- Give me! Give me! Give me!
- I never should've listened to you.

1473
01:40:51,792 --> 01:40:54,086
I was an honest man
before I met you.

1474
01:40:54,253 --> 01:40:57,256
An honest man?
You were an honest mouse!

1475
01:40:57,465 --> 01:41:00,259
- Give me. Give me.
- How I hate you!

1476
01:41:00,426 --> 01:41:03,763
Double! Double! Double!

1477
01:41:13,105 --> 01:41:16,108
Fat! Fat!

1478
01:41:16,317 --> 01:41:17,860
I'm not that fat.

1479
01:41:18,069 --> 01:41:19,612
Fat!

1480
01:41:22,031 --> 01:41:23,658
Fat!

1481
01:41:24,450 --> 01:41:26,160
Fatty!

1482
01:41:26,619 --> 01:41:30,456
Fatso!
You fat, fat, fatty, fatty, fat walrus.

1483
01:41:30,623 --> 01:41:31,999
Give me the fat books!

1484
01:41:32,166 --> 01:41:36,003
- Never, never!
- Fat, fat, fatty, fat!

1485
01:41:36,420 --> 01:41:38,130
- Oh, Jesus!
- Give them to me!

1486
01:41:38,339 --> 01:41:39,507
Give me the books!

1487
01:41:39,715 --> 01:41:41,258
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

1488
01:41:41,425 --> 01:41:43,302
- Give it to me! Give it to me!
- No! No!

1489
01:41:43,511 --> 01:41:46,055
- Give it to me! Give it to me!
- No! No!

1490
01:41:46,263 --> 01:41:48,140
Now, that's what I call celebrating.

1491
01:41:49,725 --> 01:41:52,103
You. You lousy fruit.

1492
01:41:52,269 --> 01:41:55,189
- You ruined me.
- You ungrateful breeder.

1493
01:41:55,356 --> 01:41:58,442
After he stepped in and saved
your little show, I cannot... My chains!

1494
01:41:58,609 --> 01:42:01,696
- Leave him alone!
- My Italian chains! My chains!

1495
01:42:06,492 --> 01:42:08,285
You have broken the Siegfried Oath.

1496
01:42:08,452 --> 01:42:10,746
You must die. You all must die!

1497
01:42:18,212 --> 01:42:21,090
What are you doing,
you neo-Nazi nitwit?

1498
01:42:21,257 --> 01:42:23,634
- Your show's a hit.
- Who cares?

1499
01:42:23,843 --> 01:42:25,636
You made a fool out of Hitler.

1500
01:42:25,803 --> 01:42:28,014
- He didn't need our help.
- He didn't need our help.

1501
01:42:31,225 --> 01:42:34,395
Stand still! How can I shoot you
if you keep moving?

1502
01:42:35,563 --> 01:42:37,023
Get back here!

1503
01:42:37,231 --> 01:42:39,191
Under the desk! Under the desk!

1504
01:42:40,067 --> 01:42:43,154
- Darling, quick, back in the closet.
- Okay.

1505
01:42:47,742 --> 01:42:49,452
This is no good.

1506
01:42:49,660 --> 01:42:52,204
I'm not killing anybody.

1507
01:42:52,496 --> 01:42:55,333
You must cooperate!

1508
01:42:57,585 --> 01:43:00,338
<i>All right, Bialystock und Bloom.</i>

1509
01:43:00,504 --> 01:43:02,048
Now I got you.

1510
01:43:02,256 --> 01:43:03,799
Say your prayers!

1511
01:43:04,425 --> 01:43:06,385
Remember I'd tell you
when we're in too deep?

1512
01:43:06,594 --> 01:43:08,387
- Yeah?
- We're in too deep.

1513
01:43:09,472 --> 01:43:11,932
Franz, don't do it! Please, I beg you!

1514
01:43:12,099 --> 01:43:14,769
Oh, no, no.

1515
01:43:16,896 --> 01:43:19,273
You snivelling cowards!

1516
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:21,233
Cringing under a desk?

1517
01:43:21,442 --> 01:43:25,571
Clinging to life like baby butterflies.

1518
01:43:25,738 --> 01:43:29,075
Franz Liebkind will show you
how to die like a man!

1519
01:43:36,916 --> 01:43:39,585
Jammed.
Boy, when things go wrong...

1520
01:43:41,754 --> 01:43:44,840
That's it. Next time, no author.

1521
01:43:47,134 --> 01:43:49,345
What are you shooting
at us for anyway?

1522
01:43:49,512 --> 01:43:51,138
You Teutonic twit!

1523
01:43:52,640 --> 01:43:54,600
Wait. Wait a minute.

1524
01:43:54,809 --> 01:43:56,268
I just got an idea.

1525
01:43:56,477 --> 01:43:58,771
A way to close the show.

1526
01:43:58,979 --> 01:44:01,524
Franz, I...

1527
01:44:02,817 --> 01:44:07,613
- There, there.
- Where? Where?

1528
01:44:08,114 --> 01:44:09,907
Franz, listen to me.

1529
01:44:10,074 --> 01:44:12,451
Why don't you use this
where it'll do some good.

1530
01:44:12,618 --> 01:44:15,287
- Why don't you shoot the actors.
- The actors?

1531
01:44:15,454 --> 01:44:16,956
Yes, the actors.

1532
01:44:17,123 --> 01:44:20,209
Everybody laughed at your
beloved Führer tonight, and why?

1533
01:44:20,376 --> 01:44:23,212
Because of the actors.
The actors were making fun of him.

1534
01:44:23,421 --> 01:44:24,880
Yeah, you're right, the actors!

1535
01:44:25,089 --> 01:44:28,009
Yes. Here, go, buy bullets.

1536
01:44:28,175 --> 01:44:32,096
- Kill. Kill all the actors.
- I must kill all the actors.

1537
01:44:32,304 --> 01:44:34,849
Wait a minute!

1538
01:44:35,391 --> 01:44:37,184
What are you talking about?

1539
01:44:37,351 --> 01:44:40,146
What do you mean, "kill the actors"?
You can't kill the actors.

1540
01:44:40,312 --> 01:44:42,690
Actors are not animals.
They're human beings.

1541
01:44:42,857 --> 01:44:44,900
They are?
Have you ever eaten with one?

1542
01:44:45,067 --> 01:44:47,695
- Here. Listen...
- Open up, it's the police!

1543
01:44:47,862 --> 01:44:49,822
- The police!
- The police!

1544
01:44:51,240 --> 01:44:52,491
Come on, boys.

1545
01:44:52,658 --> 01:44:55,119
I was never a member
of the Nazi Party. I had nothing...

1546
01:44:55,328 --> 01:44:57,204
You, drop that gun.

1547
01:44:58,539 --> 01:44:59,999
- Ociffers!
- What's going on here?

1548
01:45:00,207 --> 01:45:01,667
This crazy Kraut is crackers!

1549
01:45:01,876 --> 01:45:04,003
He crashed in here
and crassly tried to kill us.

1550
01:45:04,211 --> 01:45:07,465
- Oh, Roger, what alliteration.
- Thank you, darling.

1551
01:45:09,300 --> 01:45:11,594
Okay, youse two can go.

1552
01:45:11,802 --> 01:45:13,763
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1553
01:45:14,722 --> 01:45:16,349
Tried to kill him, eh?

1554
01:45:17,975 --> 01:45:19,685
Officer O'Rourke, take this man in.

1555
01:45:19,894 --> 01:45:21,354
Next stop, Sing Sing.

1556
01:45:21,562 --> 01:45:26,442
Sing Sing?
You'll never take me alive!

1557
01:45:31,572 --> 01:45:35,951
- What happened?
- I broke my other leg.

1558
01:45:41,791 --> 01:45:45,378
All right, who are you,
and why was he trying to shoot you?

1559
01:45:45,586 --> 01:45:49,423
I haven't the slightest idea,
Sergeant O'Toole.

1560
01:45:49,590 --> 01:45:52,760
The name is O'Bialystock.

1561
01:45:52,927 --> 01:45:56,931
I was just passing by on me way
to the Pat O'Brien Film Festival...

1562
01:45:57,098 --> 01:46:00,851
and I ducked in to see
what the hell was going on.

1563
01:46:01,018 --> 01:46:05,898
And now I'll be on me way,
before me voice gets any higher.

1564
01:46:07,775 --> 01:46:10,945
As we say in the old country, "Taxi!"

1565
01:46:11,112 --> 01:46:12,363
Hold it!

1566
01:46:12,613 --> 01:46:14,073
Hey, sarge, look at this.

1567
01:46:14,281 --> 01:46:16,492
- What?
- I found these two accounting books.

1568
01:46:16,659 --> 01:46:22,081
- This one says, "Show to the IRS."
- And what's the other one say?

1569
01:46:22,248 --> 01:46:25,167
" Never show to the IRS."

1570
01:46:25,376 --> 01:46:28,129
I think the three of you
better come downtown with me.

1571
01:46:28,295 --> 01:46:32,758
- Three?
- Yeah, you and them two books.

1572
01:46:39,932 --> 01:46:42,560
Mr. Bialystock?

1573
01:46:42,977 --> 01:46:45,021
Mr. Bloom?

1574
01:46:45,187 --> 01:46:47,481
Where are you?

1575
01:46:47,648 --> 01:46:51,485
Everyone is waiting for you
at the opening-night party.

1576
01:46:51,652 --> 01:46:54,822
Ulla, help me.

1577
01:47:00,328 --> 01:47:02,997
What happened to you?

1578
01:47:04,081 --> 01:47:05,541
I know.

1579
01:47:05,708 --> 01:47:09,754
You hung up your coat
while you were still in it.

1580
01:47:21,223 --> 01:47:23,934
Thank you for helping me down.

1581
01:47:32,610 --> 01:47:34,236
What were you doing up there?

1582
01:47:34,403 --> 01:47:35,654
Hiding.

1583
01:47:35,863 --> 01:47:37,198
I was hiding.

1584
01:47:37,365 --> 01:47:39,325
From who? From what?

1585
01:47:39,533 --> 01:47:40,701
From the police.

1586
01:47:40,910 --> 01:47:44,163
They were just here.
They've arrested Max.

1587
01:47:44,372 --> 01:47:46,666
- They found the books?
- I don't know what to do.

1588
01:47:46,874 --> 01:47:48,125
Poor Max.

1589
01:47:48,292 --> 01:47:51,045
Maybe I should turn myself in
and go to jail with him.

1590
01:47:51,212 --> 01:47:55,591
Well, my sweet cupcake,
I know we both love Max...

1591
01:47:55,966 --> 01:48:00,179
but it seems to me
you have two choices.

1592
01:48:00,638 --> 01:48:04,850
Number one, you can go to jail
with Mr. Bialystock...

1593
01:48:05,059 --> 01:48:09,271
for years and years and years.

1594
01:48:09,480 --> 01:48:12,149
Or number two...

1595
01:48:12,316 --> 01:48:17,822
you can take that 2 million dollars
and Ulla, and go to Rio.

1596
01:48:17,989 --> 01:48:22,034
Oh, my God, what a dilemma.

1597
01:48:22,326 --> 01:48:24,203
Oh, what should I do?

1598
01:48:24,412 --> 01:48:28,457
Should I go to jail or go to Rio?

1599
01:48:31,002 --> 01:48:33,295
Mail call.

1600
01:48:33,713 --> 01:48:36,799
Hey, fatso.

1601
01:48:37,550 --> 01:48:39,677
I'm not that fat!

1602
01:48:39,885 --> 01:48:41,595
Says you.

1603
01:48:41,804 --> 01:48:43,931
You got a postcard.

1604
01:48:44,223 --> 01:48:46,183
A postcard? From where?

1605
01:48:46,600 --> 01:48:48,310
Brazil.

1606
01:48:49,270 --> 01:48:51,147
Brazil.

1607
01:48:51,689 --> 01:48:54,233
Who do I know in Brazil?

1608
01:48:55,109 --> 01:48:57,570
Why am I asking you?

1609
01:49:02,575 --> 01:49:06,329
" Dear Max, Rio is everything
you said it was and more."

1610
01:49:07,955 --> 01:49:10,624
Ulla and I think of you
every chance we get.

1611
01:49:15,129 --> 01:49:18,132
<i>In the morning, when we
have breakfast on our terrace...</i>

1612
01:49:18,299 --> 01:49:19,925
<i>many different herrings.</i>

1613
01:49:20,843 --> 01:49:25,139
<i>In the afternoon, when we rub
each other's sun-drenched bodies...</i>

1614
01:49:25,306 --> 01:49:31,479
<i>with banana-cream coconut oil,
number 15.</i>

1615
01:49:32,813 --> 01:49:37,693
<i>"And then, in the evening, when
we samba together in the moonlight. "</i>

1616
01:49:37,860 --> 01:49:41,113
<i>You'll find your happiness in Rio</i>

1617
01:49:41,322 --> 01:49:44,575
<i>The beaches there
Are strewn with pearls</i>

1618
01:49:44,742 --> 01:49:48,079
<i>The tropic breezes
Always blow there</i>

1619
01:49:48,245 --> 01:49:51,832
<i>And so, we hear Do the girls</i>

1620
01:49:52,166 --> 01:49:55,586
<i>"Sorry, must run. Ulla's waiting."</i>

1621
01:49:55,836 --> 01:49:58,839
<i>It's almost 11.</i>

1622
01:50:00,883 --> 01:50:02,843
<i>Wish you were here.</i>

1623
01:50:03,010 --> 01:50:07,306
<i>"Your pal, Leo. "</i>

1624
01:50:08,683 --> 01:50:10,476
<i>Just like Cain and Abel</i>

1625
01:50:10,685 --> 01:50:13,062
<i>You pulled a sneak attack</i>

1626
01:50:13,270 --> 01:50:15,815
<i>I thought that we were brothers</i>

1627
01:50:16,023 --> 01:50:19,610
<i>Then you stabbed me in the back</i>

1628
01:50:19,777 --> 01:50:23,781
<i>Betrayed</i>

1629
01:50:23,948 --> 01:50:27,451
<i>Oh, boy, I'm so betrayed</i>

1630
01:50:28,327 --> 01:50:31,080
<i>Like Samson and Delilah
Your love began to fade</i>

1631
01:50:31,288 --> 01:50:33,958
<i>I'm crying in the hoosegow
You're in Rio getting laid</i>

1632
01:50:34,125 --> 01:50:36,085
<i>Betrayed</i>

1633
01:50:36,293 --> 01:50:40,047
<i>Let's face it, I'm betrayed</i>

1634
01:50:40,381 --> 01:50:45,886
<i>Boy, have I been taken</i>

1635
01:50:46,262 --> 01:50:50,182
<i>Oy, I'm so forsaken</i>

1636
01:50:50,391 --> 01:50:51,934
<i>I should have seen
What came to pass</i>

1637
01:50:52,101 --> 01:50:53,686
<i>I should have known
To watch my ass</i>

1638
01:50:53,853 --> 01:50:56,397
<i>I feel like Othello
Everything is lost</i>

1639
01:50:56,605 --> 01:50:57,857
<i>Leo is lago</i>

1640
01:50:58,065 --> 01:50:59,442
<i>Max is double-crossed</i>

1641
01:50:59,608 --> 01:51:01,235
<i>I'm so dismayed</i>

1642
01:51:01,402 --> 01:51:03,529
<i>Did I mention I'm betrayed?</i>

1643
01:51:03,738 --> 01:51:06,741
<i>Now I'm about to go to jail
There's no one who will pay my bail</i>

1644
01:51:06,907 --> 01:51:10,661
<i>I have no one who I can cry to
No one I can say goodbye to</i>

1645
01:51:11,454 --> 01:51:13,331
I'm drowning!

1646
01:51:13,539 --> 01:51:15,082
I'm drowning!

1647
01:51:15,249 --> 01:51:17,043
I'm drowning here!

1648
01:51:17,251 --> 01:51:20,921
I'm going down for the last time.

1649
01:51:21,547 --> 01:51:26,093
I can see my whole life
flashing before my eyes.

1650
01:51:26,385 --> 01:51:32,058
I see a weathered old farmhouse
with a white picket fence.

1651
01:51:32,308 --> 01:51:36,771
I'm running through fields
of alfalfa with my collie, Rex.

1652
01:51:36,979 --> 01:51:39,899
No, Rex, not on the alfalfa.

1653
01:51:42,276 --> 01:51:44,070
And I see my mother.

1654
01:51:44,278 --> 01:51:47,948
I see Mama standing
on the back porch...

1655
01:51:48,115 --> 01:51:51,035
in a worn but clean
gingham gown.

1656
01:51:51,202 --> 01:51:54,455
And I hear my mama
calling out to me.

1657
01:51:54,622 --> 01:51:55,998
Alvin!

1658
01:51:56,165 --> 01:51:58,125
Don't forget your chores.

1659
01:51:58,334 --> 01:52:01,253
The wood needs a-cording
and the cows need a-milking.

1660
01:52:01,462 --> 01:52:04,298
Alvin! Alvin!

1661
01:52:05,800 --> 01:52:07,134
Wait a minute.

1662
01:52:07,301 --> 01:52:09,428
My name's not Alvin.

1663
01:52:09,762 --> 01:52:11,806
That's not my life.

1664
01:52:12,264 --> 01:52:15,851
Somebody else's life
is flashing before my eyes.

1665
01:52:17,478 --> 01:52:20,731
What the hell is that about?

1666
01:52:21,023 --> 01:52:24,110
I'm not a hillbilly.
I grew up in the Bronx.

1667
01:52:24,318 --> 01:52:28,322
Leo's taken everything,
even my past.

1668
01:52:28,531 --> 01:52:34,370
<i>My past's a dying ember</i>

1669
01:52:34,578 --> 01:52:39,125
<i>But wait, now I remember</i>

1670
01:52:39,291 --> 01:52:41,669
<i>How did it begin?
He walk ed into my office</i>

1671
01:52:41,877 --> 01:52:43,504
<i>With his cockamamie scheme</i>

1672
01:52:43,671 --> 01:52:46,048
<i>You can make more money
With a flop than with a hit</i>

<i>We can do it We can do it</i>

1674
01:52:48,759 --> 01:52:50,803
<i>I can't do it We can do it</i>

1675
01:52:51,012 --> 01:52:53,681
<i>I can't do it Goodbye, Max</i>

1676
01:52:53,848 --> 01:52:56,308
<i>Lord, I want that money
I'm back, Max</i>

1677
01:52:56,517 --> 01:52:57,852
<i>Come on, Leo, we can do it</i>

1678
01:52:58,019 --> 01:52:59,979
<i>Step one, find the play</i>

1679

<i>You're banging Ulla on the beach</i>

1705
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:06,504
<i>Just like Julius Caesar</i>

1706
01:54:06,671 --> 01:54:08,881
<i>Was betrayed by Brutus</i>

1707
01:54:09,131 --> 01:54:12,468
<i>Who'd think an accountant
Would turn out to be my Judas</i>

1708
01:54:12,635 --> 01:54:15,179
<i>I'm so dismayed</i>

1709
01:54:15,346 --> 01:54:19,558
<i>Is this how I'm repaid?</i>

1710
01:54:19,767 --> 01:54:21,727
<i>To be</i>

1711
01:54:21,936 --> 01:54:22,480
<i>Betrayed</i>

1712
01:54:29,568 --> 01:54:31,696
<i>Betrayed</i>

1713
01:54:34,073 --> 01:54:37,576
Gentlemen of the jury,
have you reached your verdict?

1714
01:54:38,119 --> 01:54:41,288
Yes, Your Honour, we have.

1715
01:54:41,580 --> 01:54:43,708
We find the defendant...

1716
01:54:43,916 --> 01:54:46,127
incredibly guilty.

1717
01:54:49,296 --> 01:54:51,590
Hold me, touch me.

1718
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:55,011
I'm a little busy.

1719
01:54:55,344 --> 01:54:59,598
Does the defendant have
anything to say on his own behalf?

1720
01:55:01,142 --> 01:55:03,519
Yes, Your Honour, I do.

1721
01:55:04,478 --> 01:55:09,275
I admit, for the last 20 years
I've been a lying, double-crossing...

1722
01:55:09,442 --> 01:55:12,778
two-faced, backstabbing,
despicable crook.

1723
01:55:12,987 --> 01:55:14,447
But I had no choice.

1724
01:55:15,823 --> 01:55:18,826
I was a Broadway producer.

1725
01:55:19,660 --> 01:55:21,203
A man without a conscience...

1726
01:55:21,454 --> 01:55:23,914
and with no one
who gave a damn about him.

1727
01:55:24,081 --> 01:55:26,917
And that, Your Honour,
is what hurts the most.

1728
01:55:27,376 --> 01:55:31,213
I thought I'd at last
found a loyal partner.

1729
01:55:31,881 --> 01:55:34,342
A man I cared about...

1730
01:55:34,675 --> 01:55:36,635
and who I thought
cared about me.

1731
01:55:37,178 --> 01:55:38,554
What breaks my heart is now...

1732
01:55:38,763 --> 01:55:41,140
when I need him most,
he's deserted me.

1733
01:55:41,307 --> 01:55:43,851
I will probably never see
or hear from him ever again.

1734
01:55:44,018 --> 01:55:45,478
That's not true!

1735
01:55:50,107 --> 01:55:51,484
Order! Order in the court!

1736
01:55:52,068 --> 01:55:54,820
And stop that samba!

1737
01:55:56,030 --> 01:55:59,200
- Who are you?
- I am Leopold Bloom...

1738
01:55:59,367 --> 01:56:02,244
Max Bialystock's partner.

1739
01:56:02,411 --> 01:56:04,705
And who are you, my dear?

1740
01:56:04,872 --> 01:56:08,459
My name is
Ulla Inga Hansen Benson...

1741
01:56:08,626 --> 01:56:13,839
Yonsen Tallen-Hallen
Svaden Svanson Bloom.

1742
01:56:14,006 --> 01:56:15,591
Bloom?

1743
01:56:15,758 --> 01:56:18,386
<i>- You're his wife?
- Ja, Your Honour.</i>

1744
01:56:18,552 --> 01:56:21,347
He wouldn't do it
unless we got married.

1745
01:56:22,515 --> 01:56:23,766
What a schmuck.

1746
01:56:25,935 --> 01:56:28,312
Now, Mr. Bloom,
why in the world would you...

1747
01:56:28,521 --> 01:56:30,898
want to come back here
and give yourself up?

1748
01:56:31,065 --> 01:56:33,734
Why? To speak on his behalf.

1749
01:56:34,652 --> 01:56:39,615
We all know that Max Bialystock
is a lying, double-crossing...

1750
01:56:39,782 --> 01:56:44,328
two-faced, slimy,
manipulative, underhanded...

1751
01:56:44,495 --> 01:56:46,122
Please...

1752
01:56:46,580 --> 01:56:48,040
don't help me.

1753
01:56:50,084 --> 01:56:53,087
Your Honour... Your honour,
if I may address the court.

1754
01:56:54,338 --> 01:56:59,927
The law was created to protect
people from being wronged.

1755
01:57:00,094 --> 01:57:03,931
So whom has
Max Bialystock wronged?

1756
01:57:04,098 --> 01:57:07,184
- Well, not these dear ladies.
- No.

1757
01:57:07,351 --> 01:57:09,478
And not me, not...

1758
01:57:09,937 --> 01:57:11,897
Not me.

1759
01:57:12,273 --> 01:57:14,400
I was this nobody.

1760
01:57:14,608 --> 01:57:17,945
No one ever called me "Leo" before.

1761
01:57:18,112 --> 01:57:21,198
I mean, Your Honour,
I know it isn't a big legal point...

1762
01:57:21,407 --> 01:57:25,619
but even when I was in kindergarten
everybody always called me "Bloom."

1763
01:57:26,078 --> 01:57:30,124
I guess what I'm trying to say
is that even when I was in Rio...

1764
01:57:30,291 --> 01:57:35,004
and had everything
I'd ever dreamed of...

1765
01:57:38,299 --> 01:57:40,760
I suddenly realized that...

1766
01:57:40,926 --> 01:57:43,054
That this man...

1767
01:57:44,055 --> 01:57:45,765
This man...

1768
01:57:46,557 --> 01:57:49,894
<i>No one ever made me
Feel like someone</i>

1769
01:57:50,353 --> 01:57:52,313
<i>Till him</i>

1770
01:57:54,857 --> 01:57:58,444
<i>Life was really nothing
But a glum one</i>

1771
01:57:58,611 --> 01:58:02,031
<i>Till him</i>

1772
01:58:02,865 --> 01:58:06,619
<i>My existence bordered on the tragic</i>

1773
01:58:07,078 --> 01:58:10,414
<i>Always timid
Never took a chance</i>

1774
01:58:11,165 --> 01:58:13,125
<i>Then I felt his magic</i>

1775
01:58:13,334 --> 01:58:17,963
<i>And my heart began to dance</i>

1776
01:58:19,382 --> 01:58:22,968
<i>I was always frightened
Fraught with worry</i>

1777
01:58:23,177 --> 01:58:25,471
<i>Till him</i>

1778
01:58:27,682 --> 01:58:31,185
<i>I was going nowhere in a hurry</i>

1779
01:58:31,352 --> 01:58:31,896
<i>Till him</i>

1780
01:58:36,107 --> 01:58:40,319
<i>He filled up my empty life</i>

1781
01:58:40,695 --> 01:58:45,825
<i>Filled it to the brim</i>

1782
01:58:46,033 --> 01:58:52,206
<i>There could never
Ever be another one</i>

1783
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:54,544
<i>Like him</i>

1784
01:59:03,217 --> 01:59:04,844
Leo...

1785
01:59:11,267 --> 01:59:12,810
Leo...

1786
01:59:12,977 --> 01:59:15,438
I never realized.

1787
01:59:16,772 --> 01:59:20,526
- You're a good singer.
- Thank you.

1788
01:59:20,735 --> 01:59:25,031
- No, really, like a professional.
- Well, I sang it for you, Max.

1789
01:59:25,239 --> 01:59:28,242
I sang it because I'm your friend.

1790
01:59:29,493 --> 01:59:31,120
You are?

1791
01:59:32,163 --> 01:59:35,082
I've had a lot of relationships...

1792
01:59:35,249 --> 01:59:37,293
but you couldn't call
any of them "friend."

1793
01:59:37,501 --> 01:59:39,545
But come to think of it...

1794
01:59:39,754 --> 01:59:43,090
no one ever, ever really knew me.

1795
01:59:43,299 --> 01:59:46,719
<i>Till him</i>

1796
01:59:48,679 --> 01:59:52,516
<i>Everyone was always out
To screw me</i>

1797
01:59:52,725 --> 01:59:56,771
<i>Till him</i>

1798
01:59:58,022 --> 02:00:02,318
<i>Never met a man I ever trusted</i>

1799
02:00:02,610 --> 02:00:06,989
<i>Always dealt with shysters
In the past</i>

1800
02:00:07,198 --> 02:00:09,575
<i>Now I'm well-adjusted</i>

1801
02:00:09,742 --> 02:00:15,915
<i>'Cause I've got a friend at last</i>

1802
02:00:19,752 --> 02:00:21,796
Don't help me.

1803
02:00:21,962 --> 02:00:26,258
<i>Always playing singles
Never doubles</i>

1804
02:00:26,467 --> 02:00:29,303
<i>Till him</i>

1805
02:00:43,818 --> 02:00:48,280
<i>Never had a pal
To share my troubles</i>

1806
02:00:48,489 --> 02:00:49,033
<i>Till him</i>

1807
02:00:53,703 --> 02:00:58,332
<i>He filled up my empty life</i>

1808
02:00:58,916 --> 02:01:04,130
<i>- Filled it to the brim
- Filled it to the brim</i>

1809
02:01:04,547 --> 02:01:07,216
<i>There could never ever be</i>

1810
02:01:07,383 --> 02:01:13,139
<i>Another one</i>

1811
02:01:15,516 --> 02:01:16,060
<i>Like him</i>

1812
02:01:30,781 --> 02:01:32,825
Gentlemen, it breaks my heart...

1813
02:01:32,992 --> 02:01:35,369
to break up
such a beautiful friendship.

1814
02:01:35,578 --> 02:01:37,288
So I won't.

1815
02:01:37,496 --> 02:01:40,207
Five years in the state penitentiary
at Sing Sing.

1816

<i>Gotta sing, sing</i>

02:01:45,880 --> 02:01:49,383
<i>Gotta sing, sing</i>

1818
02:01:49,550 --> 02:01:51,427
<i>Oh, you can lock us up</i>

1819
02:01:51,594 --> 02:01:53,721
<i>Und lose the key</i>

Congratulations.

02:02:09,236 --> 02:02:12,406

- Six hundred percent.

1830
02:02:19,580 --> 02:02:23,167
Is that all? Keep selling.
Keep selling.

1831

All right, break it up! Break it up!
Quiet! Give me that.

How many times do
I have to tell you guys?

1833

No knife fights in rehearsal.

Hi. What are you in for,

Get in line.

good news!

This just came from the governor.

"Gentlemen, you are hereby
granted a full pardon..."

1853
02:03:29,608 --> 02:03:32,695

02:04:06,145 --> 02:04:09,398
<i>Prisoners of love
Blue skies above</i>

1862
02:04:09,815 --> 02:04:13,319
<i>- Can't keep our hearts in jail
- Can't keep our hearts in jail</i>

1863
02:04:13,527 --> 02:04:15,154
<i>Prisoners of love</i>

1864
02:04:15,363 --> 02:04:19,200
<i>- Our turtledoves
- Soon coming 'round with bail</i>

1865
02:04:19,367 --> 02:04:22,203
<i>- Tote that bale
- Oh, you can lock us up</i>

1866
02:04:22,370 --> 02:04:24,330
<i>And lose the key</i>

1867
02:04:24,538 --> 02:04:28,376
<i>But hearts in love
Are always free</i>

1868
02:04:28,542 --> 02:04:30,169
<i>Prisoners of love</i>

1869
02:04:30,336 --> 02:04:31,796
<i>Blue skies above</i>

1870
02:04:31,962 --> 02:04:33,673
<i>'Cause we're still prisoners</i>

1871
02:04:34,048 --> 02:04:35,424
<i>We're still prisoners</i>

1872
02:04:35,925 --> 02:04:38,594
<i>We're still prisoners of love</i>

1873
02:04:38,761 --> 02:04:43,057
<i>- Love, love, love
- Love, love, love, love</i>

1874
02:04:43,516 --> 02:04:45,309
<i>Love, love, love, love</i>

1875
02:04:45,476 --> 02:04:45,976
<i>Love</i>

1876
02:05:07,623 --> 02:05:09,500
<i>Leo and Max</i>

1877
02:05:09,667 --> 02:05:11,627
<i>Up off our backs</i>

1878
02:05:11,794 --> 02:05:15,548
<i>Back on the Great White Way</i>

1879
02:05:15,756 --> 02:05:17,717
<i>Leo and Max</i>

1880
02:05:17,925 --> 02:05:19,552
<i>Back on our tracks</i>

1881
02:05:19,760 --> 02:05:23,097
<i>We're back on top to stay</i>

1882
02:05:23,264 --> 02:05:27,476
<i>So when we take your money
Never fear</i>

1883
02:05:27,643 --> 02:05:31,397
<i>We'll knock Broadway
Right on its ear</i>

1884
02:05:31,605 --> 02:05:33,399
<i>The cast is great
The script is swell</i>

1885
02:05:33,607 --> 02:05:35,318
<i>But this we're telling you, sirs</i>

1886
02:05:35,484 --> 02:05:37,111
<i>It's just no go
You've got no show</i>

1887
02:05:37,320 --> 02:05:40,489
<i>Without the producers</i>

1888
02:05:43,284 --> 02:05:46,078
<i>We'll never quit</i>

1889
02:05:46,245 --> 02:05:47,621
<i>Hit after hit</i>

1890
02:05:51,792 --> 02:05:56,922
<i>The producers Leo and Max</i>

1891
02:07:46,449 --> 02:07:48,576
<i>The overture is over</i>

1892
02:07:48,743 --> 02:07:50,953
<i>The curtain starts to rise</i>

1893
02:07:51,162 --> 02:07:53,289
<i>You're suddenly in clover</i>

1894
02:07:53,456 --> 02:07:55,750
<i>You can't believe your eyes</i>

1895
02:07:55,958 --> 02:07:58,085
<i>You're sitting on the aisle</i>

1896
02:07:58,252 --> 02:08:00,463
<i>You break into a smile</i>

1897
02:08:00,671 --> 02:08:02,631
<i>Why this magic feeling?</i>

1898
02:08:02,798 --> 02:08:07,011
<i>And then you realize</i>

1899
02:08:07,178 --> 02:08:10,264
<i>That there is</i>

1900
02:08:10,431 --> 02:08:14,560
<i>Nothing like a show on Broadway</i>

1901
02:08:14,769 --> 02:08:18,814
<i>Nothing like a Broadway show</i>

1902
02:08:18,981 --> 02:08:22,568
<i>Hearts will skip a beat on Broadway</i>

1903
02:08:22,735 --> 02:08:25,279
<i>If you're feeling blue
I'm telling you</i>

1904
02:08:25,446 --> 02:08:27,323
<i>That's the place to go</i>

1905
02:08:27,531 --> 02:08:29,575
<i>Movies drag Their endings sag</i>

1906
02:08:29,784 --> 02:08:31,410
<i>TV's just a bore</i>

1907
02:08:31,619 --> 02:08:33,579
<i>So hit the street
And move your feet</i>

1908
02:08:33,788 --> 02:08:35,331
<i>To the place we all adore</i>

1909
02:08:35,498 --> 02:08:40,044
<i>Because there's nothing
Like a show on Broadway</i>

1910
02:08:40,252 --> 02:08:44,173
<i>There's nothing
Like a Broadway show</i>

1911
02:08:44,382 --> 02:08:46,092
<i>It's often been said
The theatre is dead</i>

1912
02:08:46,300 --> 02:08:48,010
<i>The critics repeat it en masse</i>

1913
02:08:48,177 --> 02:08:49,970
<i>But the theatre's alive
It's gonna survive</i>

1914
02:08:50,179 --> 02:08:51,806
<i>Although it's a pain in the ass</i>

1915
02:08:51,972 --> 02:08:53,766
<i>You waited forever
And finally got tickets</i>

1916
02:08:53,974 --> 02:08:55,851
<i>To get to your seat
You gotta cross pickets</i>

1917
02:08:56,018 --> 02:08:57,812
<i>The guy to your right
Is frightfully tight</i>

1918
02:08:58,020 --> 02:09:00,314
<i>The guy to your left
Appears to have rickets</i>

1919
02:09:00,481 --> 02:09:02,358
<i>The music's yuck
The lyrics suck</i>

1920
02:09:02,566 --> 02:09:04,443
<i>The casting is all wrong</i>

1921
02:09:04,610 --> 02:09:06,487
<i>And when you reach the bathroom</i>

1922
02:09:06,654 --> 02:09:07,989
<i>The line is five miles long</i>

1923
02:09:08,155 --> 02:09:12,451
<i>But still there's nothing
Like a show on Broadway</i>

1924
02:09:12,618 --> 02:09:16,539
<i>There's nothing
Like a Broadway show</i>

1925
02:09:16,706 --> 02:09:18,416
<i>You swear you'll never go again</i>

1926
02:09:18,624 --> 02:09:20,501
<i>It's simply not worthwhile</i>

1927
02:09:20,668 --> 02:09:22,712
<i>You make that vow
And then somehow</i>

1928
02:09:22,920 --> 02:09:27,466
<i>- You're back there on the aisle
- You're back there on the aisle</i>

1929
02:09:27,633 --> 02:09:30,886
<i>That's why there's</i>

1930
02:09:31,053 --> 02:09:34,890
<i>Nothing like a show On Broadway</i>

1931
02:09:35,099 --> 02:09:37,560
<i>There's nothing
Like a Broadway show</i>

1932
02:09:37,768 --> 02:09:39,145
<i>Till you're in movies</i>

1933
02:09:39,353 --> 02:09:43,566
<i>There's nothing
Like a Broadway show</i>

1934
02:09:43,774 --> 02:09:47,903
<i>And though it is expensive
At a hundred bucks a throw</i>

1935
02:09:48,112 --> 02:09:50,781
<i>There's nothing</i>

1936
02:09:50,948 --> 02:09:57,455
<i>Like a Broadway show!</i>

1937
02:13:09,563 --> 02:13:12,817
