3
00:03:25,768 --> 00:03:27,503
Is that a plane?

4
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:34,844
What the hell is that?

5
00:04:08,944 --> 00:04:11,712
Excuse me, Professor Hendricks?

6
00:04:14,648 --> 00:04:17,051
Why didn't I get credit
for number five?

7
00:04:23,891 --> 00:04:25,658
You didn't write anything.

8
00:04:26,994 --> 00:04:31,392
You missed a trivial solution
x=0 and y=0.

9
00:04:31,431 --> 00:04:33,461
I didn't miss it.
I didn't think it was important.

10
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,002
Find all solutions.

11
00:04:36,603 --> 00:04:39,273
You understand the definition
of "all", Mr. Echevaro?

12
00:04:45,779 --> 00:04:48,241
"Sometimes non-trivial solutions
can be found,

13
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,978
sometimes they can't.
Paradoxically, it is when

14
00:04:51,017 --> 00:04:55,348
the trivial solution is the only solution
that it's the most important case."

15
00:04:55,387 --> 00:04:57,885
Exactly. This is a
homogenous system of equations

16
00:04:57,924 --> 00:05:01,488
and the important question is whether
there are any non-trivial solutions.

17
00:05:01,527 --> 00:05:03,958
If that's the important question
then why didn't you just ask us

18
00:05:03,997 --> 00:05:05,925
if there are any
non-trivial solutions?

19
00:05:05,964 --> 00:05:09,596
Because I want you to
mathematically find all solutions.

20
00:05:09,635 --> 00:05:13,466
But the most important question is whether
the trivial solution is the only one.

21
00:05:13,505 --> 00:05:14,501
Indeed.

22
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,942
That is the case
with this problem.

23
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:20,711
So, why is it trivial
if it's so important?

24
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:25,444
Now, I saw x=0 and y=0 was the only one
so, I didn't waste my time with it,

25
00:05:25,483 --> 00:05:26,645
AKA trivial.

26
00:05:26,684 --> 00:05:28,580
I believe
you're convoluting your words.

27
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:31,755
I'm not. It's very misleading. The
book even says, "paradoxically."

28
00:05:32,023 --> 00:05:33,224
Sit down.

29
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:41,866
Anybody else
before I finish up here?

30
00:05:42,432 --> 00:05:43,633
Thank you.

31
00:05:44,467 --> 00:05:46,769
So, in the lab for next time

32
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:49,939
you should do problems
one through 43.

33
00:05:51,008 --> 00:05:53,838
<i>The GDP
of Assumption Land is 30,000,</i>

34
00:05:53,877 --> 00:05:55,245
<i>the price level is 28,</i>

35
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:57,380
the money supply is 560,000,
right?

36
00:05:57,681 --> 00:05:59,811
So, if the government decides
to flood the market,

37
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:03,047
increase the money supply
by a factor of 1.31,

38
00:06:03,086 --> 00:06:05,516
what economic variable
will be affected,

39
00:06:05,555 --> 00:06:07,484
and what will its new value be?

40
00:06:09,726 --> 00:06:12,726
Why does every problem have to
take place in Assumption Land?

41
00:06:12,728 --> 00:06:15,265
Can't they just say,
like, a real country?

42
00:06:16,432 --> 00:06:19,902
Well, it's easier than saying
"Let's assume," every single time.

43
00:06:21,003 --> 00:06:24,239
You did know that's why
it's called "Assumption Land"?

44
00:06:24,773 --> 00:06:27,003
- Speaking of flooding the market,
- NATALIE: Hey!

45
00:06:27,042 --> 00:06:30,279
did you know if everyone stopped
using condoms,

46
00:06:30,679 --> 00:06:32,881
it would actually lower
the rate of STDs?

47
00:06:32,948 --> 00:06:35,783
There would be more people
without STDs doing it.

48
00:06:35,885 --> 00:06:38,786
So, the chances of catching
something would actually be lower.

49
00:06:38,988 --> 00:06:41,256
You do not pay me enough
for this crap.

50
00:07:26,565 --> 00:07:28,395
Hey, Derek, you want to do
that lab tonight?

51
00:07:28,434 --> 00:07:30,135
Get it over with
before the exam?

52
00:07:31,938 --> 00:07:34,340
- Derek?
- Did you hear about this?

53
00:07:38,878 --> 00:07:42,214
"Flight operations at Cincinnati
Northern Kentucky International Airport

54
00:07:42,448 --> 00:07:46,518
were temporarily suspended this afternoon
after reports of a mysterious aircraft

55
00:07:46,551 --> 00:07:48,120
hovering above the airport.

56
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:51,323
Witnesses included route mechanics
and other airport employees."

57
00:07:51,424 --> 00:07:52,853
This article says it looked like

58
00:07:52,892 --> 00:07:55,494
a silver disc the size of a dime
just below the clouds.

59
00:07:55,593 --> 00:07:58,024
Dude, Natalie does not want
to hear about this.

60
00:07:58,063 --> 00:08:00,426
"A United ramp mechanic
who wished to remain anonymous,

61
00:08:00,465 --> 00:08:02,061
witnessed the aircraft
and saw it depart.

62
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,730
However, he was surprised
to hear radio chatter

63
00:08:04,769 --> 00:08:06,999
between a pilot and ground
control several minutes later

64
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:09,735
at 3:12 pm
when someone in the tower said,

65
00:08:09,774 --> 00:08:11,009
'It's still here.'"

66
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:14,539
People in the tower work with times all
day long, okay? Very specific times.

67
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:17,009
There's no way that they would
get something like that wrong.

68
00:08:17,048 --> 00:08:19,544
So, the fact that one guy
is saying one thing

69
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:23,253
and everyone else is saying something
else, it doesn't make any sense.

70
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:32,891
<i>How long did you watch it for?</i>

71
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:36,832
- <i>I ran away. I was scared.</i>
- <i>Why were you scared?</i>

72
00:08:37,533 --> 00:08:41,138
- <i>Because of the noise.</i>
- <i>What did it sound like?</i>

73
00:08:42,672 --> 00:08:45,475
- <i>Like someone was playing the flute.</i>
- <i>Was it very loud?</i>

74
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:49,345
- <i>What's the case number?</i>
- RW-11-02-04.

- Blue-15-EOXC.

77
00:08:58,988 --> 00:09:00,718
<i>What can I do for you, Mr. Ahls?</i>

78
00:09:00,757 --> 00:09:02,991
I'd like to archive
this case file.

79
00:09:03,592 --> 00:09:04,822
Insufficient evidence;

80
00:09:04,861 --> 00:09:07,263
subject is being released
from surveillance.

81
00:09:07,562 --> 00:09:10,366
<i>It felt like all the air

82
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:14,664
<i>and that the plants were going
to die and everything was bad.</i>

83
00:09:14,703 --> 00:09:16,233
<i>The contents
are being accessed now.</i>

84
00:09:16,272 --> 00:09:18,501
<i>Would you like me
to see who's accessing them?</i>

85
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,008
No, cut it off.

86
00:09:23,045 --> 00:09:26,508
<i>Okay, BLACKBOX-RW-11-02-04

No. Thank you.

90
00:09:41,962 --> 00:09:43,892
- Ahls.
- <i>We got a call from DHS</i>

91
00:09:43,931 --> 00:09:49,636
<i>about a sighting in sector 6, UTC

<i>negative 84.65842 longitude,

<i>UAP elevation
approximately 2,800.</i>

94
00:09:57,744 --> 00:09:59,807
<i>It was right over
Cincinnati Airport.</i>

95
00:09:59,846 --> 00:10:01,114
Radio?

96
00:10:01,348 --> 00:10:03,744
<i>We intercepted a signal
across all frequencies.</i>

97
00:10:03,783 --> 00:10:07,286
<i>We're sending you the radar feed
from the time of the sighting.</i>

98
00:10:30,676 --> 00:10:32,272
We interviewed
all the witnesses,

99
00:10:32,311 --> 00:10:35,141
and we now believe
it was a small drone...

Roland Junger, Airport Director.

101
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,728
I would have suggested that
you fly directly here...

102
00:10:56,767 --> 00:10:59,298
I hope your, uh, cameras
are up to DHS specs

103
00:10:59,337 --> 00:11:01,733
because I'm going to need the
footage from every single one

104
00:11:01,772 --> 00:11:03,240
in this entire facility.

105
00:11:03,274 --> 00:11:06,338
All terminals, gates, hallways,
stores, employee locker rooms,

106
00:11:06,377 --> 00:11:10,046
baggage claims, runways,
fences, hangars, parking lots.

107
00:11:10,214 --> 00:11:12,144
I'm also going to need
all the tower recordings,

108
00:11:12,183 --> 00:11:16,148
passenger manifests, and my team
is going to need four rooms,

109
00:11:16,187 --> 00:11:17,982
conference rooms preferably.

110
00:11:18,021 --> 00:11:20,084
I don't have four conference
rooms here in the terminal.

111
00:11:20,123 --> 00:11:22,820
You have two, plus the EOC
I will take those

112
00:11:22,859 --> 00:11:25,595
and one of your larger rooms,
and I will tell you which one.

113
00:11:25,795 --> 00:11:28,059
So, you want me to shut
everything down

114
00:11:28,098 --> 00:11:30,862
and start kicking people out of their
offices in the middle of the day?

115
00:11:30,901 --> 00:11:32,330
No, nothing gets shut down.

116
00:11:32,369 --> 00:11:35,672
Everything continues as normal.
There is one other thing though.

117
00:11:36,373 --> 00:11:38,974
The man who is giving
a press conference out front,

118
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:42,177
we do need to shut him down,
immediately. Thank you.

119
00:11:45,649 --> 00:11:49,679
<i>Thousands of passengers from all over
the world fly through CVG every day,</i>

120
00:11:49,718 --> 00:11:52,048
<i>but what about the ones
from out of this world?</i>

121
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:54,951
<i>Well earlier today,
airline employees and passengers</i>

122
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:56,752
<i>claimed they saw
a mysterious object</i>

123
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:59,022
<i>hovering over the airport
for several minutes</i>

124
00:11:59,061 --> 00:12:02,892
<i>before it shot off into the sky,
cutting a hole in the clouds.</i>

125
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:04,927
<i>So, what do
four billion light years</i>

<i>of frequent flyer miles get you?</i>

127
00:12:06,901 --> 00:12:09,633
<i>Well, not so fast.
Airport spokesman, Dave Ellison,</i>

128
00:12:09,672 --> 00:12:12,406
<i>held a news conference
to address that incident.</i>

129
00:12:12,874 --> 00:12:14,575
<i>We interviewed
all of the witnesses</i>

130
00:12:14,809 --> 00:12:17,206
<i>and we now believe
that it was a small drone.</i>

131
00:12:17,245 --> 00:12:20,209
<i>Four to five feet in diameter,
that drifted into our airspace.</i>

132
00:12:20,248 --> 00:12:23,145
That's what's gonna happen if Amazon
does this whole drone delivery.

133
00:12:23,184 --> 00:12:25,080
Dropping Kindles
in the middle of the runways.

134
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:28,184
It wasn't a drone okay.
The descriptions don't match,

135
00:12:28,223 --> 00:12:29,657
the times don't match.

136
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:32,727
The route mechanic said it was
the size of a...

137
00:12:35,028 --> 00:12:36,463
Of a what?

138
00:12:37,297 --> 00:12:39,232
Dime held at arm's length.

139
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:42,669
Does that match what was on TV?

140
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,438
What that guy said,
four to five feet?

141
00:12:45,706 --> 00:12:46,773
No way.

142
00:12:46,872 --> 00:12:48,303
I mean, how do you
even calculate that?

143
00:12:48,342 --> 00:12:50,109
You don't know how high it was.

144
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:53,907
Well, somebody said that it was about
100 to 200 feet below cloud cover.

145
00:12:53,946 --> 00:12:56,583
- How high was cloud cover?
- That's about 3,550?

146
00:12:57,417 --> 00:12:59,051
- No?
- Shut up, Lee!

147
00:12:59,085 --> 00:13:05,558
It was 2,900 feet,
so 27 to 2,800.

148
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:10,290
So, let's just say 2,750.

149
00:13:10,329 --> 00:13:12,392
Dude, don't you have exams
to study for or something?

150
00:13:12,431 --> 00:13:15,199
Don't you have exams
to study for or something?

151
00:13:15,334 --> 00:13:17,636
- Yes. Yeah.
- That's what I thought. Bye.

152
00:13:18,337 --> 00:13:20,773
So now, how big is a dime?

153
00:13:23,008 --> 00:13:25,109
Seventeen point nine
millimeters.

154
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:27,845
Seventeen point nine
millimeters.

155
00:13:28,013 --> 00:13:30,148
Now, what's arm's length?
Like...

156
00:13:31,116 --> 00:13:34,752
What is that? Like two feet.
Maybe a bit less. 20 inches?

157
00:13:36,187 --> 00:13:38,756
- Twenty-two inches.
- Oh crap.

158
00:13:38,856 --> 00:13:40,825
I forgot about
Professor Magg's Panel.

159
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:42,493
It's this weekend.

160
00:13:42,793 --> 00:13:45,123
You know that thing I'm setting
up, helping on the door.

161
00:13:45,162 --> 00:13:47,197
You're still coming, right?

162
00:13:49,099 --> 00:13:50,730
- Derek?
- Yeah.

163
00:13:50,769 --> 00:13:52,230
Well, I'm not going to stay late

164
00:13:52,269 --> 00:13:56,506
because I've got to take the
practice GRE the next morning.

165
00:13:58,108 --> 00:13:59,309
Where's that at?

166
00:13:59,476 --> 00:14:02,879
It's over by Xavier.
It's like a 30-minute walk.

167
00:14:03,047 --> 00:14:04,280
Uh-huh.

168
00:14:04,448 --> 00:14:07,379
- I'll drop you off.
- You don't have a car.

169
00:14:07,418 --> 00:14:10,787
- I'll borrow Lee's.
- Is Lee okay with that?

170
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,421
Well...

171
00:14:12,855 --> 00:14:15,358
Can you make sure?
Because I can't miss this.

172
00:14:16,359 --> 00:14:18,394
- I can't miss this.
- Yeah.

173
00:14:19,329 --> 00:14:23,199
X equals 88. It doesn't match!

174
00:14:23,366 --> 00:14:27,197
X equals 88. He was lying!
The guy on TV was lying.

175
00:14:27,236 --> 00:14:29,772
It's not four to five feet.
It's way bigger.

176
00:14:33,443 --> 00:14:35,872
- Hello?
- <i>Uh, hi. Mr. Ellison?</i>

177
00:14:35,911 --> 00:14:37,612
- Yes.
- <i>I was just wondering</i>

178
00:14:37,846 --> 00:14:39,476
<i>if we could ask some questions
about the sighting at the airport.</i>

179
00:14:39,515 --> 00:14:42,378
- I'm sorry. Who is this?
- My name is Derek Echevaro,

180
00:14:42,417 --> 00:14:44,480
and I got your cellphone number

181
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:46,482
from the voicemail
at your office.

182
00:14:46,521 --> 00:14:47,917
Who do you work for?

183
00:14:47,956 --> 00:14:50,520
The News Record.
<i>We just had a few questions</i>

184
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:53,556
we wanted to ask based on eyewitness
accounts, there were things we learned...

185
00:14:53,595 --> 00:14:56,058
I've never heard of <i>The News Record.</i>
Is that out of Ohio?

186
00:14:56,097 --> 00:14:58,432
- Is that based out of Ohio?
- <i>University of Cincinnati.</i>

187
00:14:58,467 --> 00:15:00,702
University? You mean...

188
00:15:15,383 --> 00:15:17,079
- Yes?
- <i>I think we got disconnected.</i>

189
00:15:17,118 --> 00:15:18,585
Do not call this number again.

190
00:15:19,153 --> 00:15:21,350
<i>I just want to know why you thought
it was four to five feet in diameter.</i>

191
00:15:21,389 --> 00:15:24,523
<i>Witness account says it was about the
size of a dime held at arm's length.</i>

192
00:15:24,525 --> 00:15:27,556
Cloud cover was 2,900 feet,
it was about 100 to 200 feet

193
00:15:27,595 --> 00:15:30,530
below that which would make it
88 feet in diameter.

194
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:50,076
<i>Sir, Whitley is in the
field with a potential witness</i>

195
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,918
and she's claiming
to have heart problems.

196
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,447
There are plenty of other
witnesses they need to talk to.

197
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:56,755
Call an ambulance
and have them move on.

198
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:03,022
Paramedics will have to take her to
Edgewood instead of Florence anyway.

199
00:16:03,061 --> 00:16:04,262
Excuse me.

200
00:16:05,063 --> 00:16:06,998
I keep getting calls
from this guy.

201
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:10,836
He's saying he knows
the aircraft was 88 feet across.

202
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,103
Did you get his name
of this person?

203
00:16:18,142 --> 00:16:20,311
Derek Echevaro.

204
00:16:23,214 --> 00:16:24,548
Thanks, Dave.

205
00:16:27,251 --> 00:16:29,920
Did any camera
get a visual on this UAP?

206
00:16:30,421 --> 00:16:32,490
- Pull up Gate A8.
- Yes sir.

207
00:16:33,391 --> 00:16:35,826
<i>No, nothing there.
How about A18?</i>

208
00:16:37,027 --> 00:16:39,662
<i>Do we have a clearer shot
of the south runway?</i>

209
00:16:41,499 --> 00:16:44,195
<i>I'm not seeing anything. How
about the north side perimeter?</i>

210
00:16:44,234 --> 00:16:45,602
<i>There you go.</i>

211
00:16:47,971 --> 00:16:51,102
<i>There's nothing. Let's go
back inside the terminal, A4.</i>

212
00:16:51,141 --> 00:16:52,407
<i>Yes sir.</i>

213
00:16:52,409 --> 00:16:54,071
<i>All right, freeze that.</i>

214
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:56,073
<i>I want the names
of all those passengers.</i>

215
00:16:56,112 --> 00:16:58,715
<i>Now,
take me to the ticket counter.</i>

216
00:16:59,716 --> 00:17:02,451
<i>Freeze that. Okay, rewind it.</i>

217
00:17:04,053 --> 00:17:06,918
<i>I want all those employees
and anyone else from the ground</i>

218
00:17:06,957 --> 00:17:08,390
<i>in Conference Room A.</i>

219
00:17:08,491 --> 00:17:10,859
<i>I've been told that this
is a federal investigation now.</i>

220
00:17:11,093 --> 00:17:15,831
So, you should know that
if any of you talk to anyone,

221
00:17:16,632 --> 00:17:20,402
your coworkers, your friends,
your family,

222
00:17:20,436 --> 00:17:22,070
including your spouses,

223
00:17:23,171 --> 00:17:25,234
you could be charged
with obstruction of justice.

224
00:17:25,273 --> 00:17:29,205
Where's everyone else?
Why's it just us here?

225
00:17:29,244 --> 00:17:30,707
Yeah,
why is it just us here?

226
00:17:30,746 --> 00:17:32,208
What's going on?

227
00:17:40,021 --> 00:17:42,990
They're saying it's a plane now.
Natalie texted me.

228
00:17:47,762 --> 00:17:48,963
Look at this.

229
00:17:50,565 --> 00:17:52,733
Okay.

230
00:17:55,102 --> 00:17:57,098
"After reviewing
the witness testimony,

231
00:17:57,137 --> 00:17:59,133
federal officials
have come to the conclusion

232
00:17:59,172 --> 00:18:01,002
that the mysterious aircraft

233
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:04,644
seen over Cincinnati Northern
Kentucky International Airport,

234
00:18:04,778 --> 00:18:09,577
was in fact a Gulfstream IV airplane
with a length of 88 feet...

235
00:18:09,616 --> 00:18:10,917
Eighty-eight feet...

236
00:18:12,386 --> 00:18:17,150
"It matches witness descriptions
and investigators are confident

237
00:18:17,189 --> 00:18:18,987
that the mystery
has been solved."

238
00:18:19,026 --> 00:18:20,459
He's using my math!

239
00:18:20,561 --> 00:18:23,963
He's using what I told him
on the phone to cover it up.

240
00:18:24,697 --> 00:18:28,529
I bet you there is no record
of a Gulfstream IV coming in

241
00:18:28,568 --> 00:18:30,669
or out of the airport that day.

242
00:18:31,504 --> 00:18:35,369
Go to ATCAudioLive.com.
Look up Cincinnati.

243
00:18:35,408 --> 00:18:36,675
Uh...

244
00:18:36,709 --> 00:18:40,645
ATCAudioLive.

245
00:18:48,754 --> 00:18:51,484
- Somebody must've taken it down.
- No, it's live streaming.

246
00:18:51,523 --> 00:18:54,592
People listen to that stuff
all day, every day.

247
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,761
Somebody recorded it.

248
00:19:42,605 --> 00:19:44,335
We'll be out soon, okay?

249
00:19:44,374 --> 00:19:45,841
You'll never be alone.

250
00:20:06,361 --> 00:20:08,191

<i>Hey!
When are we gonna do the lab?</i>

256
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,301
Uh, I don't know.

257
00:21:23,402 --> 00:21:26,038
Today's not so good.
I didn't go to Diff. EQ.

258
00:21:26,438 --> 00:21:28,807
<i>Why not?
Didn't you have an exam?</i>

<i>Where are you?</i>

260
00:21:30,843 --> 00:21:32,610
I'm at Cincinnati Airport.

261
00:21:32,911 --> 00:21:35,746
This terminal is crawling
with federal agents.

262
00:21:36,582 --> 00:21:37,744
Why would they still be here

263
00:21:37,783 --> 00:21:40,118
if they already figured out
what it was?

264
00:21:40,753 --> 00:21:43,988
<i>It is an airport.
How did you get in?</i>

265
00:21:44,522 --> 00:21:46,223
Bought the cheapest ticket
I could find.

266
00:21:46,357 --> 00:21:48,487
<i>Derek!
We need to start the lab today.</i>

267

<i>I can't get a B

268
00:21:51,696 --> 00:21:53,264
Professor Hendricks?

269
00:21:53,831 --> 00:21:54,999
Hi. Um...

270
00:21:55,733 --> 00:21:58,235
I was just wondering,
it's such a crazy time.

271
00:21:58,268 --> 00:22:01,734
Uh, with my midterms one after the
other, I was just wondering...

272
00:22:01,773 --> 00:22:05,309
If you are asking for
an extension, the answer is no.

273
00:22:05,777 --> 00:22:06,976
Why?

274
00:22:08,712 --> 00:22:13,578
Derek, you are one of the brightest
students I have ever had,

275
00:22:13,617 --> 00:22:17,053
and you are also the most
disruptive and argumentative.

276
00:22:17,954 --> 00:22:21,919
Even when you know other people
are right, you argue your point.

277
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:24,789
Well, that trivial-non-trivial
stuff is so confusing...

278
00:22:24,828 --> 00:22:27,930
No, it isn't... not for you.

279
00:22:29,032 --> 00:22:31,900
You're on scholarship
from the Akamai Foundation.

280
00:22:32,668 --> 00:22:34,837
Yes, I read my students' files.

281
00:22:35,704 --> 00:22:38,401
And you got that scholarship
because you placed in the Olympiad

282
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,643
which is one of the top
math competitions in the country

283
00:22:41,911 --> 00:22:44,012
and you are failing my class.

284
00:22:47,983 --> 00:22:50,285
Is there something
we need to talk about?

285
00:22:55,657 --> 00:22:56,858
No.

286
00:23:09,904 --> 00:23:11,534
<i>I've been at CVG a long time</i>

287
00:23:11,573 --> 00:23:13,636
<i>and I've never seen
an object like this.</i>

288
00:23:13,675 --> 00:23:16,538
<i>What was it like at
the airport after the sighting?</i>

289
00:23:16,577 --> 00:23:17,840
<i>Chaos, I imagine?</i>

290
00:23:17,879 --> 00:23:19,980
<i>It was fairly chaotic.</i>

291
00:23:20,048 --> 00:23:23,279
<i>The government showed up
after about two hours</i>

292
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:25,880
<i>and there were agents everywhere.
And then they brought us all</i>

293
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,155
<i>into a conference room,
everyone who had seen it.</i>

294
00:23:28,422 --> 00:23:30,051
<i>They didn't tell us
what was going on.</i>

295
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:31,419
<i>They took away our phones;</i>

296
00:23:31,458 --> 00:23:33,621
<i>they kept us there
for about ten hours.</i>

297
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:36,796
<i>They didn't let us call home,
didn't let us use the internet.</i>

298
00:23:36,964 --> 00:23:38,797
<i>It was... It was terrifying.</i>

299
00:23:39,066 --> 00:23:41,562
<i>The airline employee
said he heard radio chatter</i>

300
00:23:41,601 --> 00:23:43,497
<i>from pilots
and other airport workers</i>

301
00:23:43,536 --> 00:23:45,405
<i>about the unidentified object.</i>

302
00:23:45,638 --> 00:23:47,634
<i>However,
despite repeated requests,</i>

303
00:23:47,673 --> 00:23:49,336
<i>the FAA has yet to turn over</i>

304
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:53,412
<i>any transcripts or recordings
from the tower radio that day.</i>

305
00:24:00,418 --> 00:24:03,189
You really think someone's
gonna have this recording on here?

306
00:24:04,924 --> 00:24:08,989
Is this a... is this part
of that airline forum thing?

307
00:24:09,028 --> 00:24:11,263
It's a chatroom on Tor.

308
00:24:11,696 --> 00:24:12,897
What's Tor?

309
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,631
It's one of the ways to get
into the dark web,

310
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:20,700
which is where people do things
that are illegal

311
00:24:20,739 --> 00:24:22,774
because it's very hard to trace.

312
00:24:26,477 --> 00:24:28,112
"Their Plans Against Us"?

313
00:24:28,914 --> 00:24:30,448
Whose plans against us?

314
00:24:30,916 --> 00:24:33,050
It's H.G. Wells'
<i>War of the Worlds.</i>

315
00:24:36,787 --> 00:24:42,392
Hmm, "ATCronnie, Pilot81604,"

316
00:24:43,594 --> 00:24:45,790
You know, these are just a bunch
of people in Yoda outfits

317
00:24:45,829 --> 00:24:47,331
making up fake accounts.

318
00:24:48,399 --> 00:24:50,128
It might not be
the pilot of a 747,

319
00:24:50,167 --> 00:24:52,097
it might be someone who flies
little planes...

320
00:24:52,136 --> 00:24:57,374
Yeah, or it might be someone who was
born on August 16th, 2004, right?

321
00:24:57,808 --> 00:25:00,604
What are the numbers at the end?
81604?

322
00:25:00,643 --> 00:25:02,912
Probably 13 years old.

323
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,043
Here we go.
"CincyDawn" says they have them.

324
00:25:06,082 --> 00:25:07,350
Dawn?

325
00:25:08,084 --> 00:25:10,681
D-A-W-N? Like the name Dawn?

326
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,417
- What's her deal?
- Oh, God.

327
00:25:13,456 --> 00:25:15,753
What?
She probably goes to UC.

328
00:25:15,792 --> 00:25:17,453
She's probably not interested.

329
00:25:17,492 --> 00:25:19,428
- Probably real smart...
- Probably 13.

330
00:25:20,529 --> 00:25:21,997
- Right.
- Right.

331
00:25:25,901 --> 00:25:27,403
Why are there so many files?

332
00:25:27,502 --> 00:25:30,539
United, American, these are all
the different frequencies.

333
00:25:32,941 --> 00:25:35,043
Here we go, here's the tower.

334
00:25:37,612 --> 00:25:39,642
<i>United 367
preparing for takeoff.</i>

335
00:25:39,681 --> 00:25:41,611
<i>Not sure if you're picking
this up on radar,</i>

336
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:44,948
<i>but to our left looks like a
stationary drone, some sort of drone.</i>

337
00:25:44,987 --> 00:25:46,321
<i>On the runway?</i>

338
00:25:46,587 --> 00:25:48,617
<i>No, south of that.
Down by you guys in the tower;</i>

339
00:25:48,656 --> 00:25:50,954
<i>altitude maybe 2,700 feet.
Please advise.</i>

340
00:25:52,526 --> 00:25:54,589
<i>I'm not seeing anything,
but I'll have a look.</i>

341
00:25:54,628 --> 00:25:55,657
The hell was that noise?

342
00:25:55,696 --> 00:25:56,992
<i>You have eyes on it now?</i>

343
00:25:57,031 --> 00:25:59,133
<i>It's not moving,
just hanging out there.</i>

344
00:25:59,166 --> 00:26:01,163
<i>Copy that,
three six seven. Stand by.</i>

345
00:26:01,202 --> 00:26:03,198
<i>Anyone else hearing this?</i>

346
00:26:03,237 --> 00:26:04,804
<i>What is it, Hal?</i>

347
00:26:05,573 --> 00:26:09,410
<i>Three six seven, I'm getting confirmation
down here that it's still there.</i>

348
00:26:09,542 --> 00:26:11,944
What'd she say? Did she say Al?

349
00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:15,676
- <i>Copy that, three six seven, standby.</i>
- <i>Anyone else hearing this?</i>

350
00:26:15,715 --> 00:26:17,484
<i>What is it, Hal?</i>

351
00:26:17,817 --> 00:26:19,486
Sounds like "Hal."
I heard an "H."

352
00:26:19,819 --> 00:26:20,848
<i>Three six seven,</i>

353
00:26:20,887 --> 00:26:22,922
- <i>I'm getting confirmation.</i>
- Yeah.

354
00:26:31,698 --> 00:26:33,626
- <i>Tower.</i>
- Hi, I'm looking for Hal.

355
00:26:33,665 --> 00:26:35,201
Hal, Al, Hal.

356
00:26:35,835 --> 00:26:36,964
<i>Hal Lapierre?</i>

357
00:26:37,003 --> 00:26:39,104
Yes. Is he on shift right now?

358
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:40,473
<i>Let me check.</i>

359
00:26:40,806 --> 00:26:43,208
Good luck with Hal, dude.
I'm going to get you a drink.

360
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:45,545
Hey, yo, Zach!
Where's that vodka?

361
00:26:50,983 --> 00:26:54,920
<i>two, three... 523...</i>

362
00:26:55,521 --> 00:26:57,083
<i>Five over...</i>

363
00:26:57,122 --> 00:26:59,857
<i>Hello? Who's calling?</i>

364
00:27:00,225 --> 00:27:02,327
Sir, you couldn't have seen it.

365
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,960
<i>Who is this?</i>

366
00:27:03,962 --> 00:27:06,192
They said you saw the UFO,
on the radio.

367
00:27:06,231 --> 00:27:08,927
They said that you said
that it was still there.

368
00:27:08,966 --> 00:27:11,663
<i>Are you a reporter?
I can't talk about this.</i>

369
00:27:11,702 --> 00:27:12,937
Why not?

370
00:27:13,071 --> 00:27:14,800
<i>Because I can't, okay.
I'm sorry.</i>

371
00:27:14,839 --> 00:27:17,703
No, no, wait, wait. I understand
that somebody told you

372
00:27:17,742 --> 00:27:19,238
you're not allowed to
talk about it but...

373
00:27:19,277 --> 00:27:20,973
- <i>No, I never said that.</i>
- There's no way

374
00:27:21,012 --> 00:27:23,008
that you could've seen it,
you would've had to been

375
00:27:23,047 --> 00:27:24,977
- looking almost directly up, and
- <i>It wasn't that...</i>

376
00:27:25,016 --> 00:27:27,578
there's an overhang on the tower
that would've blocked your view,

377
00:27:27,617 --> 00:27:28,880
I know you could
get in trouble

378
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:30,748
- <i>That's not...</i>
- for talking, but there's no way

379
00:27:30,787 --> 00:27:32,583
you'd have seen it
even if it was there.

380
00:27:32,622 --> 00:27:34,118
<i>I never said I saw it! I...</i>

381
00:27:35,926 --> 00:27:37,160
Mr. Lapierre?

382
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,102
He didn't see it, he heard it.

383
00:27:47,971 --> 00:27:49,172
The static.

384
00:27:51,174 --> 00:27:52,609
Wh... what about it?

385
00:27:52,942 --> 00:27:54,377
That's what he heard.

386
00:27:55,744 --> 00:27:57,647
The interference
is from the UFO.

387
00:28:00,249 --> 00:28:02,584
<i>Yeah, it's not moving,
just hanging out there.</i>

388
00:28:02,618 --> 00:28:04,848
<i>Copy that
three six seven, stand by.</i>

389
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:32,308
It's a sequence of tones.
Each is one-tenth of a second

390
00:28:32,347 --> 00:28:36,345
represented here by these circles,
and then the dashes are one-tenth

391
00:28:36,384 --> 00:28:41,883
of a second of silence
so in total, it's 2,623 symbols

392
00:28:41,922 --> 00:28:44,492
which comes out
to four minutes and 23 seconds.

393
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,122
And then it started
to repeat itself,

394
00:28:47,161 --> 00:28:49,291
but it stopped.
I have no idea why.

395
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:51,431
You think
it's some sort of signal?

396
00:28:52,032 --> 00:28:54,401
What's that?
Nine four three three?

397
00:28:56,036 --> 00:28:58,833
Well, I was thinking maybe
it was binary

398
00:28:58,872 --> 00:29:03,108
like a 32-bit computer looks
at chunks of 32, 64 at 64.

399
00:29:03,143 --> 00:29:06,673
I have no idea how to break this
up, but I think that it's a 14-bit

400
00:29:06,712 --> 00:29:10,077
because you've got 14 circles here
at the beginning and at the end.

401
00:29:10,116 --> 00:29:12,418
- Hmm.
- So, if it is 14,

402
00:29:12,852 --> 00:29:16,950
this chunk comes out
to 9,433 okay?

403
00:29:16,989 --> 00:29:19,692
Or you could bring it into
two seven-digit chunks,

404
00:29:19,992 --> 00:29:22,528
one is 73 and one is 89.

405
00:29:25,398 --> 00:29:28,367
- You gonna come over again?
- Do you wanna help figure this out?

406
00:29:28,401 --> 00:29:29,862
No, I have to study.

407
00:29:29,901 --> 00:29:31,864
I don't get anything done
when Lee is around.

408
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:34,172
Will you at least
take a copy home?

409
00:29:35,308 --> 00:29:37,275
Afternoon.

410
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:40,645
Non-homogenous systems.

411
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:44,516
These are systems that might not
have any solutions at all.

412
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:53,023
<i>It's open.</i>

413
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:56,255
Hi. My name is Natalie,

414
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:57,989
I'm in your
Linear Algebra class,

415
00:29:58,028 --> 00:30:00,330
and I was wondering
about letters of recommendation.

416
00:30:00,332 --> 00:30:03,396
I only give letters of recommendation
to students who finish with an A,

417
00:30:03,435 --> 00:30:06,064
so I will talk to you at the end
of the semester.

418
00:30:06,103 --> 00:30:09,406
Right, okay.
Sorry if I'm jumping the gun.

419
00:30:11,308 --> 00:30:12,543
Um...

420
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:16,107
Would it maybe be possible
to get an extension on the lab?

421
00:30:16,146 --> 00:30:18,615
- I already told Derek no.
- Yeah.

422
00:30:19,149 --> 00:30:21,518
He's got a lot
going on right now.

423
00:30:23,086 --> 00:30:25,417
From what I've read, a lot
of the best mathematicians

424
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:29,820
do their best work in their early
20's; Einstein, Ramanujan...

425
00:30:29,859 --> 00:30:32,796
Riemann, Abel, Galois,
I know the list.

426
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:35,231
You.

427
00:30:40,169 --> 00:30:42,170
Look,
I've made my contributions.

428
00:30:43,506 --> 00:30:47,643
Now it's your turn,
but you have got to do the lab.

429
00:30:49,945 --> 00:30:53,749
Either get him on board,
or do it yourself.

430
00:30:57,252 --> 00:30:59,821
Okay.
Thank you.

431
00:31:55,008 --> 00:31:56,437
<i>Hello, leave a message.</i>

432
00:31:56,476 --> 00:31:59,206
Lee, I've figured it out.
It's dates.

433
00:31:59,245 --> 00:32:01,875
And it's close to 0.007297.

434
00:32:01,914 --> 00:32:05,178
That's the Fine-Structure Constant,
but it's in 14-digit chunks.

435
00:32:05,217 --> 00:32:07,548
<i>I think maybe they're trying
to figure out how smart we are.</i>

436
00:32:07,587 --> 00:32:09,849
<i>Or they're trying to tell us
they're from a planet</i>

437
00:32:09,888 --> 00:32:11,786
<i>that has the same
physical laws as ours.</i>

438
00:32:11,825 --> 00:32:14,020
<i>But they're not from
five billion light years away...</i>

439
00:32:14,059 --> 00:32:16,561
He's already figured it out.
It's the FSC.

440
00:32:20,566 --> 00:32:23,229
Isn't the lead singer like
the main part of the band?

441
00:32:23,268 --> 00:32:25,265
So, it may as well be
a cover band with,

442
00:32:25,304 --> 00:32:27,400
you know, it's like the same
guitarist and everything,

443
00:32:27,439 --> 00:32:30,235
but I just feel like on
a basic level, like,

444
00:32:30,274 --> 00:32:32,576
it's pretty different right?
I mean, I don't know.

445
00:32:34,646 --> 00:32:37,409
Lee, did you get my message?
They're using basic math

446
00:32:37,448 --> 00:32:41,185
as a way to communicate:
1+2=3, 3-2=1.

447
00:32:41,285 --> 00:32:44,186
Okay and the Fine-Structure
Constant is in there.

448
00:32:44,188 --> 00:32:47,052
So maybe they're trying to tell us
they're actually from somewhere nearby

449
00:32:47,091 --> 00:32:50,189
or maybe they're just trying to establish
a common mathematical language

450
00:32:50,228 --> 00:32:51,457
so we can actually decode it.

451
00:32:51,496 --> 00:32:53,325
I mean,
anyone who knows basic math

452
00:32:53,364 --> 00:32:58,969
and physics, knows numbers
like 3.14159 and 0.007297.

453
00:32:59,537 --> 00:33:03,273
Yeah, of course.
What is this 38?

454
00:33:03,907 --> 00:33:05,308
That's binary.

455
00:33:06,343 --> 00:33:10,208
Then there's 2,623 times 2,953.

456
00:33:10,247 --> 00:33:13,944
Okay so 2,623 is the total
number of bits in the signal.

457
00:33:13,983 --> 00:33:15,546
Each one is one-tenth
of a second long.

458
00:33:15,585 --> 00:33:19,417
That comes out
to roughly 774,572 seconds.

459
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:21,952
So that's almost
exactly nine days, okay.

460
00:33:21,991 --> 00:33:23,960
So, Tuesday,
the day of the sighting,

461
00:33:24,126 --> 00:33:25,623
plus nine days,
that's next Thursday.

462
00:33:25,662 --> 00:33:27,362
That's six days from now.

463
00:33:29,665 --> 00:33:31,800
Okay,
so what's happening Thursday?

464
00:33:32,568 --> 00:33:34,336
Maybe it's coming back.

465
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:41,438
<i>I'm not an astrophysicist
so thank you for coming.</i>

466
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:45,379
I just want to ask you a few questions
about the Fine-Structure Constant.

467
00:33:45,681 --> 00:33:48,612
I'm told that you could shed some
light on it, how it could be used

468
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:50,980
as a benchmark
for determining intelligence

469
00:33:51,019 --> 00:33:52,887
or pinpointing
a location in space.

470
00:33:53,488 --> 00:33:56,919
Using the FSC
to determine intelligence

471
00:33:56,958 --> 00:33:58,491
is fairly straightforward,

472
00:33:58,493 --> 00:34:01,629
but using it to pinpoint a
location in space is problematic.

473
00:34:02,062 --> 00:34:04,926
Say the FSC is different
in different parts of space,

474
00:34:04,965 --> 00:34:07,735
which there's essentially
no evidence of.

475
00:34:07,968 --> 00:34:11,065
If the FSC did depend on things
like local density,

476
00:34:11,104 --> 00:34:14,502
and if two places,
way far apart from each other

477
00:34:14,541 --> 00:34:17,011
had the same local density,

478
00:34:17,077 --> 00:34:19,646
they might also have
the same FSC.

479
00:34:19,948 --> 00:34:21,943
And if you gave
that number to someone,

480
00:34:21,982 --> 00:34:24,050
how would they know
which place to go?

481
00:34:24,718 --> 00:34:27,981
But if we had more than one,
couldn't we use them

482
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:30,824
the same way we use pulsars
to pinpoint locations?

483
00:34:30,990 --> 00:34:33,026
Over a much greater distance,
obviously?

484
00:34:33,393 --> 00:34:36,658
The idea that it's different
in different parts of space

485
00:34:36,697 --> 00:34:39,032
isn't really
the focus of research now.

486
00:34:42,401 --> 00:34:45,165
You know, I have a room full of
scientists who haven't been able

487
00:34:45,204 --> 00:34:46,839
to explain anything to me.

488
00:34:50,376 --> 00:34:53,072
<i>The mystery continues
concerning the object seen</i>

489
00:34:53,111 --> 00:34:56,008
<i>hovering over CVG
this past Tuesday</i>

490
00:34:56,047 --> 00:34:58,612
<i>which the FAA says
is no longer unidentified,</i>

491
00:34:58,651 --> 00:35:01,987
<i>but was actually
a Gulfstream IV airplane.</i>

492
00:35:02,087 --> 00:35:05,953
<i>Reports of more bizarre activity around
the time of the sighting have surfaced,</i>

493
00:35:05,992 --> 00:35:09,894
<i>including widespread disruption
of radio and cellphone signals.</i>

494
00:35:10,028 --> 00:35:13,159
<i>Verizon, AT&T
and Sprint all confirmed</i>

495
00:35:13,198 --> 00:35:16,462
<i>major service interruptions
in the Ohio and Kentucky area</i>

496
00:35:16,501 --> 00:35:20,437
<i>near the airport, with T-Mobile
being the least affected.</i>

497
00:35:53,369 --> 00:35:54,733
<i>Were you open last Tuesday?</i>

498
00:35:54,772 --> 00:35:56,433
<i>Did you hear about the thing
at the airport?</i>

499
00:35:56,472 --> 00:35:58,636
<i>No, I didn't see,
but I heard about it.</i>

500
00:35:58,675 --> 00:36:00,671
<i>And I think it might have messed
with my cellphone.</i>

501
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:02,712
<i>I kept getting all this static.</i>

502
00:36:07,684 --> 00:36:10,052
<i>Hey!
Were you open last Tuesday?</i>

503
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:20,623
So, if this was a UFO, right?

504
00:36:20,662 --> 00:36:22,964
- And there were aliens on it...
- Mm-hmm.

505
00:36:23,165 --> 00:36:24,900
...what do you think
they would look like?

506
00:36:25,801 --> 00:36:29,905
You mean, do I think they're like
little grey people with big black eyes?

507
00:36:31,073 --> 00:36:33,909
- Yeah.
- Okay. Uh...

508
00:36:34,576 --> 00:36:35,777
Think about this.

509
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:38,775
I can take these two shakers,
right?

510
00:36:38,814 --> 00:36:41,882
Put them in front of you
and count them. One, two,

511
00:36:42,183 --> 00:36:43,680
- Mm-hmm.
- because they stay in place,

512
00:36:43,719 --> 00:36:44,747
- right?
- Mm-hmm.

513
00:36:44,786 --> 00:36:46,448
But if I was from
a liquid planet,

514
00:36:46,487 --> 00:36:49,384
and I don't mean a planet
that's just covered in ocean,

515
00:36:49,423 --> 00:36:51,687
but one that is molten
all the way through,

516
00:36:51,726 --> 00:36:53,488
by the time
I put the second one down,

517
00:36:53,527 --> 00:36:55,062
- the first...
- Will burn up!

518
00:36:55,262 --> 00:36:58,098
- No, Lee. The first one...
- Or it would be gone.

519
00:36:58,131 --> 00:36:59,661
well, it could have moved off.

520
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:00,901
Mm.

521
00:37:02,268 --> 00:37:04,138
You know, I asked
what they would look like.

522
00:37:05,405 --> 00:37:09,043
Well...
they probably look like...

523
00:37:10,377 --> 00:37:13,713
something so far beyond
what you could possibly imagine.

524
00:37:18,151 --> 00:37:19,780
"Found something in the signal.
I'll tell you

525
00:37:19,819 --> 00:37:21,921
if you come
to the party tonight."

526
00:37:22,455 --> 00:37:23,690
What party?

527
00:37:24,156 --> 00:37:26,159
It's probably
that Sigma Kai thing.

528
00:37:27,226 --> 00:37:29,062
Is that... is that Natalie?

529
00:37:35,701 --> 00:37:38,204
9,433 is a prime number;

530
00:37:38,771 --> 00:37:41,106
the multiplier
at the end of the signal.

531
00:37:41,173 --> 00:37:44,042
Nine thousand four hundred
and thirty-three times 38.

532
00:37:45,744 --> 00:37:46,806
So, what does that mean?

533
00:37:46,845 --> 00:37:48,273
Well,
a sequence of prime numbers

534
00:37:48,312 --> 00:37:50,543
could mean it came
from an intelligent lifeform,

535
00:37:50,582 --> 00:37:55,153
but one on its own doesn't mean
anything necessarily.

536
00:37:56,287 --> 00:37:59,057
- So, you're going?
- To what?

537
00:37:59,357 --> 00:38:02,159
To the party
that you just agreed to go to.

538
00:38:02,827 --> 00:38:04,662
We're heading over at eight.

539
00:38:07,198 --> 00:38:09,628
You're right, this is stupid.
I'm can't, I'm sorry.

540
00:38:09,667 --> 00:38:10,868
This is first...

541
00:38:16,607 --> 00:38:18,876
Text me
if you change your mind.

542
00:39:09,859 --> 00:39:11,253
<i>Campus Police.</i>

543
00:39:11,292 --> 00:39:13,689
Yeah, hey, I just got home,

544
00:39:13,728 --> 00:39:16,425
and someone has broken
into my apartment, okay.

545
00:39:16,464 --> 00:39:20,902
All my stuff's... oh, shit.

546
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:23,137
My webcam's on.

547
00:39:25,774 --> 00:39:28,537
There's an executable running
in the System Processes

548
00:39:28,576 --> 00:39:31,212
and my webcam was on.
I didn't turn it on.

549
00:39:33,648 --> 00:39:35,183
Could you possibly have a virus?

550
00:39:38,385 --> 00:39:40,887
It's not a virus.
It's not behaving like a virus.

551
00:39:42,489 --> 00:39:45,692
Did anyone
physically break in here?

552
00:39:46,527 --> 00:39:47,727
Yeah.

553
00:39:47,995 --> 00:39:50,697
I just have one more question.
Whose is this?

554
00:40:40,011 --> 00:40:42,008
There was an executable running
in the background

555
00:40:42,047 --> 00:40:43,776
and I had no idea what it was.

556
00:40:43,815 --> 00:40:45,477
I tried reformatting
the computer,

557
00:40:45,516 --> 00:40:46,813
but it just showed up again.

558
00:40:46,852 --> 00:40:48,413
It was on Lee's computer too.

559
00:40:48,452 --> 00:40:50,049
<i>Hello, leave a message.</i>

560
00:40:50,088 --> 00:40:52,751
- I saw something in the activity monitor.
- He's still not answering.

561
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:53,920
It looks like somebody was...

562
00:40:53,959 --> 00:40:56,126
Had tried to change
the size of...

563
00:41:00,531 --> 00:41:04,968
Twenty-six twenty-three
doesn't have any other divisors

564
00:41:05,436 --> 00:41:07,938
other than 43 and 61, does it?

565
00:41:09,874 --> 00:41:11,741
Those are both prime.

566
00:41:17,081 --> 00:41:21,317
So, if I resize the window
61 by 43...

567
00:41:23,086 --> 00:41:24,287
it's a grid!

568
00:41:24,988 --> 00:41:28,157
All the dots line up!
Why didn't I see this before?

569
00:41:28,424 --> 00:41:31,722
They wanted us to know
that 2,623 meant something,

570
00:41:31,761 --> 00:41:33,362
like the Arecibo Signal.

571
00:41:34,396 --> 00:41:35,960
The signal that Frank Drake
and Carl Sagan

572
00:41:35,999 --> 00:41:38,762
sent out into space
in the '70's, right?

573
00:41:38,801 --> 00:41:41,036
That was
a semi-prime number too.

574
00:41:42,838 --> 00:41:45,374
We have to go. Professor
Magg's panel discussion;

575
00:41:45,607 --> 00:41:46,808
it's today.

576
00:41:49,011 --> 00:41:54,149
Nine four three, three times 38,
Nine four three, three times 22;

577
00:41:54,616 --> 00:41:56,351
what do these two lines mean?

578
00:41:59,054 --> 00:42:02,990
I wonder if they've got anything to
do with the Fine-Structure Constant.

579
00:42:20,474 --> 00:42:22,738
Can anyone explain to me
how this can be used

580
00:42:22,777 --> 00:42:24,777
for determining intelligence?

581
00:42:25,112 --> 00:42:27,780
As well as pinpointing
a location in space?

582
00:42:31,118 --> 00:42:34,521
How come we don't know everything
there is to know about this number?

583
00:42:35,021 --> 00:42:36,389
People?

584
00:42:36,656 --> 00:42:39,086
I guarantee you, if this
was the Manhattan Project

585
00:42:39,125 --> 00:42:41,989
or you all were trying to decode
the Enigma machine,

586
00:42:42,028 --> 00:42:44,425
things would be
a little bit different in here.

587
00:42:44,464 --> 00:42:47,433
So, I'm gonna try to put this in a
little bit of perspective for you.

588
00:42:50,502 --> 00:42:52,538
Ten to the sixteen watts
of energy.

589
00:42:54,174 --> 00:42:56,903
Now, I know you're all familiar
with the Kardashev Scale,

590
00:42:56,942 --> 00:42:59,811
Type I, Type ll,
Type lll civilizations.

591
00:43:00,546 --> 00:43:04,644
Type I is a global civilization
that controls an energy level

592
00:43:04,683 --> 00:43:07,486
roughly equivalent
to all of the solar energy

593
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:09,254
striking the planet's surface.

594
00:43:09,621 --> 00:43:13,425
Ten to the sixteen
or seventeen watts.

595
00:43:13,659 --> 00:43:16,488
Type ll controls
all the energy from a star

596
00:43:16,527 --> 00:43:18,330
and Type lll is galactic.

597
00:43:20,631 --> 00:43:25,136
Right now,
we are about a Type 0.7.

598
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:28,867
We are becoming
a global civilization,

599
00:43:28,906 --> 00:43:30,703
but we are not quite there yet.

600
00:43:30,742 --> 00:43:37,081
We control... roughly ten
to the 13 watts of energy.

601
00:43:37,215 --> 00:43:40,284
Now, scientists like you,

602
00:43:40,584 --> 00:43:43,882
have calculated that we might
possibly make the transition

603
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:47,190
to a Type I in the next
hundred years or so,

604
00:43:47,891 --> 00:43:50,026
if we don't
destroy ourselves first.

605
00:43:51,828 --> 00:43:55,532
We should see evidence of Type I,
Type ll, Type lll civilizations

606
00:43:55,632 --> 00:43:58,930
everywhere in the universe,
if they existed,

607
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:01,071
but what have we found so far?

608
00:44:01,171 --> 00:44:04,274
Nothing, which makes me think

609
00:44:05,108 --> 00:44:08,006
it's either very rare
or impossible

610
00:44:08,045 --> 00:44:11,009
to make that first step
to becoming a Type I,

611
00:44:11,048 --> 00:44:13,510
but whatever,
or whomever, showed up

612
00:44:13,549 --> 00:44:15,284
at CVG the other day,

613
00:44:16,552 --> 00:44:18,854
traveled huge distances
to get here.

614
00:44:19,955 --> 00:44:22,252
They have a mastery
of space travel that,

615
00:44:22,291 --> 00:44:24,593
well, we can't even
begin to understand.

616
00:44:25,995 --> 00:44:28,896
Chances are they have made
that first step,

617
00:44:29,165 --> 00:44:30,566
maybe even the second.

618
00:44:32,968 --> 00:44:35,032
And we need to find out
how they did it

619
00:44:35,071 --> 00:44:36,099
and learn from that

620
00:44:36,138 --> 00:44:38,339
because I don't know about you,
but...

621
00:44:38,673 --> 00:44:40,908
I'm pretty sure
we can't do it on our own.

622
00:44:54,989 --> 00:44:57,552
<i>It's eight o' clock, have
you tried calling Lee at all?</i>

623
00:44:57,591 --> 00:44:59,059
He's going to be fine.

624
00:44:59,294 --> 00:45:01,756
The second you sat down,
you had your computer open

625
00:45:01,795 --> 00:45:03,664
and you were working
on that crap!

626
00:45:04,031 --> 00:45:06,094
I bet you totally forgot
about tomorrow.

627
00:45:06,133 --> 00:45:09,230
You're taking the practice GRE
at 9:00, I'm driving you.

628
00:45:09,269 --> 00:45:12,300
Now will you please just...
will you come with me

629
00:45:12,339 --> 00:45:14,235
because there's something
I want to show you.

630
00:45:14,274 --> 00:45:15,737
Derek, I'm going home.

631
00:45:15,776 --> 00:45:17,511
I didn't sleep at all
last night.

632
00:45:17,610 --> 00:45:19,346
I'm sure Lee didn't either.

633
00:45:19,745 --> 00:45:21,242
What if he gets kicked out
of school?

634
00:45:21,281 --> 00:45:23,450
His Dad's a huge benefactor
at UC.

635
00:45:25,985 --> 00:45:28,387
Okay, now will you come with me?
Please?

636
00:45:39,165 --> 00:45:40,499
Over here.

637
00:45:46,872 --> 00:45:51,477
Okay, so if this is the distance
between the Sun and the Earth,

638
00:45:52,010 --> 00:45:54,680
how far do you think
the next closest star is?

639
00:45:54,946 --> 00:45:56,414
Proxima Centauri?

640
00:45:57,215 --> 00:45:58,416
Twenty feet?

641
00:45:59,851 --> 00:46:01,052
See, 71?

642
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:05,356
About twice as far as that,
4.3 miles.

643
00:46:06,191 --> 00:46:07,725
Now, if that's our scale,

644
00:46:08,093 --> 00:46:10,395
how big do you think
the galaxy is?

645
00:46:13,331 --> 00:46:15,934
You'd have to keep walking
in that direction

646
00:46:16,401 --> 00:46:19,704
until you got right back here;
all the way around the world,

647
00:46:19,970 --> 00:46:22,206
and then do that
three more times.

648
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:24,541
And that's just our galaxy.

649
00:46:25,009 --> 00:46:28,773
There are at least 100 billion
other galaxies out there.

650
00:46:28,812 --> 00:46:31,081
Derek, do you know
why I did that panel today?

651
00:46:32,715 --> 00:46:36,348
Because I live on Earth. And I need
to get in good with Professor Magg

652
00:46:36,387 --> 00:46:39,222
so he'll give me a
recommendation for grad school.

653
00:46:39,889 --> 00:46:42,052
What's your plan?
What are you doing?

654
00:46:42,091 --> 00:46:45,222
'Cause it seems like the only thing
you care about is that signal.

655
00:46:45,261 --> 00:46:47,530
It is the only thing
I care about.

656
00:46:56,339 --> 00:46:58,674
When I was a kid,
I saw something.

657
00:47:02,145 --> 00:47:05,515
I was in the diner
where my Mom used to work...

658
00:47:09,419 --> 00:47:13,288
<i>and I saw these lights outside.</i>

659
00:47:14,423 --> 00:47:18,393
<i>Not like a helicopter light,
or airplane, or whatever.</i>

660
00:47:20,162 --> 00:47:25,065
I mean, they were...
They were moving together.

661
00:47:26,934 --> 00:47:28,997
And it wasn't like
some grainy video

662
00:47:29,036 --> 00:47:30,472
where you can't see anything.

663
00:47:31,206 --> 00:47:32,473
I saw it.

664
00:47:35,243 --> 00:47:38,679
<i>I tried to tell her about it,
but she didn't listen to me.</i>

665
00:47:42,149 --> 00:47:43,784
<i>What was she supposed to do?</i>

666
00:47:44,085 --> 00:47:45,419
Believe me.

667
00:47:47,221 --> 00:47:48,789
Do something.

668
00:47:50,924 --> 00:47:53,661
- I don't know.
- Put yourself in her shoes.

669
00:47:54,462 --> 00:47:57,497
You know, your kid
starts talking about aliens.

670
00:48:01,234 --> 00:48:02,770
You know what I think?

671
00:48:04,004 --> 00:48:05,738
I think she just didn't care.

672
00:48:09,442 --> 00:48:11,477
Okay, so you have some baggage.

673
00:48:12,312 --> 00:48:15,582
Doesn't give you the right to
treat everyone else like shit.

674
00:48:22,221 --> 00:48:23,823
Hundreds of years go by...

675
00:48:25,391 --> 00:48:28,327
and people make tiny,
little improvements.

676
00:48:29,528 --> 00:48:33,565
And then there's an opportunity
to take a giant leap forward.

677
00:48:33,999 --> 00:48:36,602
Like with relativity,
or going to the moon.

678
00:48:38,437 --> 00:48:40,305
When it's your finals week,

679
00:48:40,506 --> 00:48:42,402
you cut yourself off
from everyone.

680
00:48:42,441 --> 00:48:45,711
You go to the library,
you drink 100 cans of Red Bull.

681
00:48:46,278 --> 00:48:48,375
You don't talk to anyone
for, like, four days,

682
00:48:48,414 --> 00:48:51,682
because you know everything
is riding on it.

683
00:48:52,383 --> 00:48:54,352
This is my finals week.

684
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:59,123
What are the most important
questions in the world?

685
00:48:59,857 --> 00:49:01,292
"Is there a God?"

686
00:49:02,859 --> 00:49:04,629
"What happens when we die?"

687
00:49:05,430 --> 00:49:09,700
And...
"Are we alone in the universe?"

688
00:49:12,537 --> 00:49:15,639
If anyone answered
any one of those questions,

689
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:18,308
it would change everything.

690
00:49:39,195 --> 00:49:41,865
We're never as alone
as we think we are.

691
00:49:59,914 --> 00:50:03,651
Hey, we've...
we've been trying to call you.

692
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:05,720
Phone's dead.

693
00:50:07,422 --> 00:50:09,218
What, did they give you
a fine or what?

694
00:50:09,257 --> 00:50:10,491
Mm-hmm.

695
00:50:11,493 --> 00:50:14,562
You're not going to get
kicked out of school, are you?

696
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:29,509
Lee, I... I didn't know
that stuff was in there,

697
00:50:30,310 --> 00:50:33,508
but I think someone's monitoring
our computers.

698
00:50:33,547 --> 00:50:34,748
Who?

699
00:50:35,516 --> 00:50:37,884
What the fuck are the police
going to do about it?

700
00:50:38,152 --> 00:50:41,521
Right. I probably
should have called the FBI.

701
00:50:42,423 --> 00:50:45,826
So basically,
I got in trouble for nothing.

702
00:50:50,930 --> 00:50:53,293
We almost figured it out, okay?

703
00:50:53,332 --> 00:50:56,435
If you put it into a grid,
43 by 61,

704
00:50:57,136 --> 00:50:58,871
it makes so much more sense.

705
00:51:00,373 --> 00:51:02,169
And there are
these two lines on it

706
00:51:02,208 --> 00:51:04,410
and I think
they might be coordinates.

707
00:51:14,052 --> 00:51:15,788
- Could I borrow your car?
- No.

708
00:51:16,489 --> 00:51:18,117
Can you drive me
to the airport then?

709
00:51:18,156 --> 00:51:21,521
Oh, man!
I have exams. Don't you?

710
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:25,730
Tuesday, but Dave Ellison
has to see this.

711
00:51:26,231 --> 00:51:27,398
And then what?

712
00:51:27,699 --> 00:51:29,629
He's just going to crack
and admit to everything?

713
00:51:29,668 --> 00:51:31,569
I don't see how he can deny it.

714
00:51:33,638 --> 00:51:35,339
Can't you take a bus?

715
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:38,404
The only way I'm going to catch him
is if he's coming in or out of work.

716
00:51:38,443 --> 00:51:40,305
And if I can't get
into the employee lot,

717
00:51:40,344 --> 00:51:42,013
I was going to follow him.

718
00:51:42,346 --> 00:51:43,547
Home?

719
00:51:46,383 --> 00:51:47,579
This is the last time.

720
00:51:47,618 --> 00:51:50,320
I will never ask you
for anything ever again.

721
00:53:10,298 --> 00:53:11,465
That's him!

722
00:53:21,274 --> 00:53:23,110
- Go, man!
- Yeah.

723
00:53:23,209 --> 00:53:24,744
Before he gets away!

724
00:53:40,827 --> 00:53:42,427
Mr. Ellison?

725
00:53:42,629 --> 00:53:44,759
Did you know that there was a coded
message in the tower recording?

726
00:53:44,798 --> 00:53:46,493
- What?
- In the tower recording.

727
00:53:46,532 --> 00:53:49,162
It sounded like interference,
but it was actually a signal.

728
00:53:49,201 --> 00:53:50,597
I'm sorry. Who are you?

729
00:53:50,636 --> 00:53:52,499
I'm Derek.
We spoke on the phone last week.

730
00:53:52,538 --> 00:53:55,268
Excuse me? Is this the long-term lot?
I think I'm lost.

731
00:53:55,307 --> 00:53:57,771
You held a press conference
at five o' clock that day.

732
00:53:57,810 --> 00:54:01,274
I saw you on TV and you said that
you had interviewed everyone.

733
00:54:01,313 --> 00:54:02,709
Did you do that yourself?

734
00:54:02,748 --> 00:54:04,016
How in depth were they?

735
00:54:04,083 --> 00:54:05,812
Were they five minutes
or two hours or...

736
00:54:05,851 --> 00:54:07,614
- I don't know...
- So, you didn't do it?

737
00:54:07,653 --> 00:54:09,487
- He didn't say any...
- He who?

738
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:11,551
So, there was only one guy?

739
00:54:11,590 --> 00:54:14,186
And how many people did you interview?
I mean, I know about eight

740
00:54:14,225 --> 00:54:16,522
from the news article and you
could not have started until...

741
00:54:16,561 --> 00:54:19,059
- Is there a problem here?
- 3:30 or 4:00 the earliest.

742
00:54:19,098 --> 00:54:21,627
So if there was one guy, and each
one was about a half-hour long,

743
00:54:21,666 --> 00:54:23,432
and there were
eight eye witnesses,

744
00:54:23,434 --> 00:54:26,198
I don't see how you could've started
a press conference at five.

745
00:54:26,237 --> 00:54:27,638
Is there a problem here?

746
00:54:28,272 --> 00:54:29,802
We spoke to all of them
briefly before...

747
00:54:29,841 --> 00:54:32,571
You said that, "We interviewed
all the witnesses on that day."

748
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:35,273
- The actual interviews didn't take place...
- But you didn't do them!

749
00:54:35,312 --> 00:54:37,747
Do you know how many threats
the airport gets every day?

750
00:54:37,782 --> 00:54:39,845
If it's not somebody threatening
to blow up a plane,

751
00:54:39,884 --> 00:54:42,513
they're going to bring on
box cutters, hijack it,

752
00:54:42,552 --> 00:54:44,616
gun down people in the terminal,
you name it.

753
00:54:44,655 --> 00:54:46,484
In the middle of all of this,

754
00:54:46,523 --> 00:54:48,024
I have
some maintenance workers say

755
00:54:48,158 --> 00:54:50,488
they saw something hovering
near the runways, but it left,

756
00:54:50,527 --> 00:54:53,123
so we checked surveillance.
There's no indication of it.

757
00:54:53,162 --> 00:54:55,093
- Tower didn't see anything.
- They couldn't have...

758
00:54:55,132 --> 00:54:56,494
So what are we supposed to do?

759
00:54:56,533 --> 00:54:58,796
Issue a no-fly warning
to your aliens?

760
00:54:58,835 --> 00:55:00,497
Try to convince
the Air Force to scramble

761
00:55:00,536 --> 00:55:03,139
just to shoot down something
that we can't find on radar?

762
00:55:03,305 --> 00:55:04,334
Close down the airport

763
00:55:04,373 --> 00:55:05,837
and have people
miss their flights

764
00:55:05,876 --> 00:55:07,872
because of something most
people don't believe exists?

765
00:55:07,911 --> 00:55:09,840
Even if the people in the tower
said they saw...

766
00:55:09,879 --> 00:55:12,743
- They didn't see anything!
- You have eight independent descriptions

767
00:55:12,782 --> 00:55:14,878
- from your own employees...
- Did you see it?

768
00:55:14,917 --> 00:55:16,580
We did
a thorough investigation...

769
00:55:16,619 --> 00:55:18,782
- The interviews were formality!
- We found it was a Gulfstream IV,

770
00:55:18,821 --> 00:55:21,123
- Look at the tower! With overhang
- matches what they saw.

771
00:55:21,157 --> 00:55:22,886
- how'd they know?
- What the other people saw.

772
00:55:22,925 --> 00:55:25,894
- How would they even know that?
- Because it's what I told them to say!

773
00:55:30,432 --> 00:55:32,167
I want them out of here.

774
00:55:41,643 --> 00:55:43,778
Natalie, he admitted it.

775
00:55:43,878 --> 00:55:45,947
Dave admitted it was a cover-up.

776
00:55:49,617 --> 00:55:52,253
- Did you hear what I said?
- Yeah.

777
00:55:54,488 --> 00:55:56,590
Are you... Are you mad at me?

778
00:55:57,658 --> 00:55:59,993
What do you need,
Derek? Study notes?

779
00:56:00,394 --> 00:56:01,589
What? No.

780
00:56:01,628 --> 00:56:03,096
Then why are you here?

781
00:56:03,330 --> 00:56:04,492
I came here to tell this

782
00:56:04,531 --> 00:56:06,833
'cause you're not
answering your phone.

783
00:56:07,468 --> 00:56:09,196
Do you understand
how huge this is?

784
00:56:09,235 --> 00:56:10,732
I missed the GRE
because of you!

785
00:56:10,771 --> 00:56:12,534
The practice GRE!

786
00:56:12,573 --> 00:56:16,009
Derek, if you had the chance
to redo things

787
00:56:16,744 --> 00:56:21,181
and all the circumstances were the same,
would you still have left me there?

788
00:56:24,751 --> 00:56:26,252
That's what I thought.

789
00:56:26,986 --> 00:56:29,822
Look, what do I have to do
to fix this?

790
00:56:30,490 --> 00:56:34,626
You can't, okay? You had a
choice and you made it.

791
00:56:38,396 --> 00:56:39,597
Natalie?

792
00:57:26,277 --> 00:57:29,745
<i>You'll never be alone.
You know that, right?</i>

793
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,969
<i>You think
it's some sort of signal?</i>

794
00:58:40,047 --> 00:58:41,448
Oh, shit!

795
00:59:34,099 --> 00:59:35,400
Come on!

796
01:00:00,524 --> 01:00:01,924
Hello?

797
01:00:01,926 --> 01:00:04,528
<i>Can I talk
to Professor Hendricks, please?</i>

798
01:00:04,761 --> 01:00:06,024
Who is this?

799
01:00:06,063 --> 01:00:09,933
<i>It's Derek.
I'm in one of her classes.</i>

800
01:00:12,002 --> 01:00:14,871
It's Derek.
He says he's a student.

801
01:00:20,811 --> 01:00:24,547
Derek?
How did you get this number?

802
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:26,610
<i>I know it's late
and I shouldn't be here,</i>

803
01:00:26,649 --> 01:00:28,318
- <i>but I have something...</i>
- Here?

804
01:00:29,585 --> 01:00:31,848
There are numbers you can call
where trained professionals

805
01:00:31,887 --> 01:00:33,684
- are available 24 hours...
- You're the best...

806
01:00:33,723 --> 01:00:36,119
- You're the best mathematician I know!
- To deal with this issue.

807
01:00:36,158 --> 01:00:38,961
This isn't some bullshit
textbook problem, okay?

808
01:00:39,128 --> 01:00:42,498
This is more complicated than
anything you've ever seen before.

809
01:00:42,530 --> 01:00:46,035
And if I'm right, I've got 'til three
o'clock tomorrow to figure it out.

810
01:00:46,869 --> 01:00:48,903
<i>Where'd this come from?</i>

811
01:00:49,038 --> 01:00:50,938
The tower radio at an airport.

812
01:00:52,241 --> 01:00:54,510
Becca, is everything all right?

813
01:00:54,976 --> 01:00:56,978
Yeah. Go back to bed.

814
01:00:57,712 --> 01:00:58,980
We'll just be a minute.

815
01:01:00,248 --> 01:01:01,844
Sorry if I woke you guys.

816
01:01:01,883 --> 01:01:03,217
No, you're not.

817
01:01:07,489 --> 01:01:10,491
You know there was a man
who lived a long time ago,

818
01:01:10,624 --> 01:01:12,926
a brilliant man, an inventor.

819
01:01:15,230 --> 01:01:17,465
He took credit
for other people's work.

820
01:01:17,998 --> 01:01:19,995
He conducted
dangerous experiments

821
01:01:20,034 --> 01:01:22,836
with radiation that cost
his assistant his arms.

822
01:01:23,604 --> 01:01:25,800
He even helped
to create the electric chair,

823
01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:28,136
and he used it to kill somebody
in order to prove

824
01:01:28,175 --> 01:01:32,079
that his competitor's technology
was dangerous.

825
01:01:35,249 --> 01:01:37,084
His name was Thomas Edison.

826
01:01:39,987 --> 01:01:42,589
You strike me
as that kind of person, Derek.

827
01:01:44,191 --> 01:01:47,026
Now don't get me wrong,
I like electricity,

828
01:01:47,060 --> 01:01:48,922
and the world needs
people like that,

829
01:01:48,961 --> 01:01:52,465
but I certainly wouldn't want
to be friends with him.

830
01:01:55,134 --> 01:01:57,036
I'm sorry, could you sit down?

831
01:02:02,542 --> 01:02:04,610
You said this came
from a tower radio?

832
01:02:04,709 --> 01:02:05,944
Yeah.

833
01:02:06,145 --> 01:02:08,042
There was something hovering
over the airport last week.

834
01:02:08,081 --> 01:02:09,582
Yeah, I heard about that.

835
01:02:10,183 --> 01:02:14,653
I think that this is a signal
from that, uh, aircraft.

836
01:02:17,589 --> 01:02:21,159
You know what I've never understood
about you conspiracy theorists?

837
01:02:21,626 --> 01:02:25,557
Say you parked your car in the same
spot every single day outside school.

838
01:02:25,596 --> 01:02:28,266
- I don't have a car.
- Let's just say you did.

839
01:02:29,134 --> 01:02:32,335
And say you parked it in the
same spot every single day.

840
01:02:32,337 --> 01:02:35,700
And then one day, you came out
and your car wasn't there,

841
01:02:35,739 --> 01:02:38,409
and instead,
there was an orange cone.

842
01:02:39,043 --> 01:02:41,541
Would you automatically assume
that your car had turned

843
01:02:41,580 --> 01:02:44,609
into an orange cone?
Or would you assume that...

844
01:02:44,648 --> 01:02:46,078
- Professor...
- it had gotten towed, or

845
01:02:46,117 --> 01:02:48,113
that you'd accidentally
parked in a different spot?

846
01:02:48,152 --> 01:02:50,421
I don't see what that has to do
with anything.

847
01:02:51,155 --> 01:02:53,690
You don't automatically jump

848
01:02:53,723 --> 01:02:56,192
to the most extreme
explanations.

849
01:02:56,926 --> 01:03:00,124
You analyze
the reasonable ones first.

850
01:03:00,163 --> 01:03:02,965
I've done that, obviously!

851
01:03:03,967 --> 01:03:07,703
And nothing that happened
at the airport makes any sense.

852
01:03:09,305 --> 01:03:10,573
At all.

853
01:03:12,609 --> 01:03:14,477
Do you have the tower recording?

854
01:03:15,178 --> 01:03:17,575
<i>No, south,
down by you guys in the tower.</i>

855
01:03:17,614 --> 01:03:19,582
<i>Altitude maybe 2700 feet...</i>

856
01:03:21,650 --> 01:03:24,085
<i>I'm not seeing anything,
but I'll have a look.</i>

857
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:25,982
<i>Do you have eyes on it now?</i>

858
01:03:26,021 --> 01:03:28,323
- <i>Yeah, it's not moving...</i>
- No.

859
01:03:28,824 --> 01:03:31,426
The signal strengths are
different on different channels.

860
01:03:32,761 --> 01:03:37,165
The strongest is the American
Ground ops, and then the tower,

861
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,067
and then the quietest is United.

862
01:03:48,377 --> 01:03:52,875
Okay.
United is 131.075 MHz,

863
01:03:52,914 --> 01:03:56,050
the tower is 360.85,

864
01:03:56,417 --> 01:04:00,588
American is 460.675.

865
01:04:03,191 --> 01:04:05,759
It gets louder
as the frequency gets higher.

866
01:04:06,427 --> 01:04:07,661
Hmm.

867
01:04:10,864 --> 01:04:12,165
The phones.

868
01:04:19,206 --> 01:04:22,904
T-Mobile is 700 to 1700 MHz
and above.

869
01:04:22,943 --> 01:04:26,112
The rest are 800, 850...

870
01:04:31,351 --> 01:04:33,553
Every carrier had interference

871
01:04:33,719 --> 01:04:37,189
except for T-Mobile
for some calls.

872
01:04:38,057 --> 01:04:41,560
So somewhere between 700 and...
thank you...

873
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:44,329
1700 MHz, it stopped.

874
01:04:52,371 --> 01:04:55,701
Wait, SETI said you should
use 1,420 MHz

875
01:04:55,740 --> 01:04:57,337
when you're sending
a signal, because it has

876
01:04:57,376 --> 01:05:00,307
the same radiation frequency
as neutral hydrogen,

877
01:05:00,346 --> 01:05:03,447
and hydrogen is the most common
element in the universe.

878
01:05:04,182 --> 01:05:07,518
Any intelligent life form
would know that it's special.

879
01:05:08,019 --> 01:05:11,355
So, maybe they broadcast
to all frequencies...

880
01:05:12,924 --> 01:05:15,321
until it built up to 1,420 MHz,

881
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:19,196
and then they spiked it at 1,420
to draw our attention to it.

882
01:05:19,796 --> 01:05:22,165
What uses 1,400 MHz?

883
01:05:23,834 --> 01:05:27,504
- Wireless telemetry systems.
- Hospitals.

884
01:05:27,838 --> 01:05:29,801
Any hospital even remotely
near the airport

885
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:31,742
would've gone
completely haywire.

886
01:05:34,911 --> 01:05:39,143
- <i>St. Elizabeth.</i>
- Hello, this is Dr., uh, Edison

887
01:05:39,182 --> 01:05:41,813
from the University
of Cincinnati Medical Center.

888
01:05:41,852 --> 01:05:45,350
We were just wondering if you
had recently had any issues

889
01:05:45,389 --> 01:05:48,419
with your wireless
telemetry systems.

890
01:05:48,458 --> 01:05:51,260
<i>Yeah, I think we did actually.
Last week.</i>

891
01:05:51,528 --> 01:05:53,730
<i>We had to send patients
to Edgewood.</i>

892
01:05:54,830 --> 01:05:57,767
The only things we don't
know are these two lines.

893
01:05:57,867 --> 01:06:03,172
9,433 times 38
and 9,433 times 22.

894
01:06:05,107 --> 01:06:08,711
Maybe they're landing patterns,
or maybe they're coordinates.

895
01:06:09,178 --> 01:06:12,276
207,526 meters north.

896
01:06:12,315 --> 01:06:14,144
How would they know
what a meter is?

897
01:06:14,183 --> 01:06:16,585
Or a foot, or anything.

898
01:06:16,786 --> 01:06:18,080
Maybe it's not even north
and east.

899
01:06:18,119 --> 01:06:19,454
Maybe it's west and south.

900
01:06:20,021 --> 01:06:23,257
Well, the equations are meant to be
read left to right and bottom to top,

901
01:06:23,358 --> 01:06:25,460
and so it would make sense
that...

902
01:06:25,894 --> 01:06:29,197
the coordinates might be
up and over.

903
01:06:30,799 --> 01:06:33,534
But I think you need
to talk to a physicist

904
01:06:34,536 --> 01:06:36,532
or an astrophysicist.

905
01:06:36,571 --> 01:06:38,405
I could recommend a couple.

906
01:06:40,442 --> 01:06:42,275
What? Professor.

907
01:06:42,377 --> 01:06:45,441
I know you think that if we stare
at that signal long enough,

908
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:47,175
that something is
going to click,

909
01:06:47,214 --> 01:06:48,815
but you can't force it.

910
01:06:49,249 --> 01:06:51,813
And I am certainly
not the person

911
01:06:51,852 --> 01:06:53,754
who's going to help you
crack it.

912
01:06:53,921 --> 01:06:58,859
I mean, math, science, physics?
It's a young person's game.

913
01:07:00,227 --> 01:07:02,328
Riemann. Galois.

914
01:07:04,198 --> 01:07:05,493
Einstein.

915
01:07:05,532 --> 01:07:08,902
Eugène Ehrhart was 60
when he got his PhD.

916
01:07:09,902 --> 01:07:11,504
The Ehrhart polynomial?

917
01:07:12,338 --> 01:07:14,573
Yitang Zhang was 57

918
01:07:15,074 --> 01:07:17,171
when he proved that there
were an infinite number

919
01:07:17,210 --> 01:07:19,808
of consecutive pairs of primes

920
01:07:19,847 --> 01:07:22,076
that were separated by less than
70 million.

921
01:07:22,115 --> 01:07:23,410
Two examples.

922
01:07:23,449 --> 01:07:26,814
Schrodinger. Frohlich. Smale.

923
01:07:26,853 --> 01:07:29,689
Okay! Okay.

924
01:07:32,090 --> 01:07:33,491
But I'm telling you...

925
01:07:34,993 --> 01:07:36,461
you can't force it.

926
01:07:43,468 --> 01:07:46,738
And sometimes,
you just get stuck.

927
01:07:59,250 --> 01:08:00,819
I know that look.

928
01:08:04,388 --> 01:08:05,656
Okay.

929
01:08:07,525 --> 01:08:08,826
I'm kicking you out.

930
01:08:16,534 --> 01:08:20,938
We are servants rather than
masters of Mathematics.

931
01:08:21,906 --> 01:08:25,508
So, you're saying I just have
to wait for it to come to me.

932
01:08:25,910 --> 01:08:28,644
Do you know the definition
of "we," Mr. Echevaro?

933
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:06,380
All right, let them through.

934
01:09:06,615 --> 01:09:08,717
Opening up.

935
01:09:54,528 --> 01:09:57,964
We need to be collecting every
channel across the state right now.

936
01:11:05,295 --> 01:11:06,630
Afternoon.

937
01:11:32,855 --> 01:11:38,060
Chapter four.
Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors.

938
01:11:40,261 --> 01:11:43,999
Now, if we have
a square matrix "A"

939
01:11:44,165 --> 01:11:46,495
that represents
a linear transformation,

940
01:11:46,534 --> 01:11:49,398
then this matrix
times the vector

941
01:11:49,437 --> 01:11:54,542
is equal to a scalar lambda
times the same vector.

942
01:11:54,609 --> 01:11:57,506
Now, the "v"
is called an eigenvector,

943
01:11:57,545 --> 01:11:59,842
and the lambda
is called an eigenvalue,

944
01:11:59,881 --> 01:12:01,683
and these kinds of problems
have...

945
01:12:01,783 --> 01:12:03,646
applications
in all kinds of things,

946
01:12:03,685 --> 01:12:05,786
like structural engineering,
and...

947
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:08,655
and spin transitions
and neutral hydrogen.

948
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:22,069
And it has a wavelength
of 21 centimeters.

949
01:12:26,573 --> 01:12:28,842
That would be significant,
wouldn't it?

950
01:12:29,777 --> 01:12:30,978
Derek?

951
01:12:35,682 --> 01:12:36,911
It doesn't matter.

952
01:12:36,950 --> 01:12:39,752
The matrix is double,
or half, or whatever.

953
01:12:39,852 --> 01:12:42,054
Twenty-one centimeters.

954
01:12:43,823 --> 01:12:45,758
Twenty-one centimeters, what?

955
01:12:45,858 --> 01:12:47,960
The frequency of hydrogen.

956
01:12:52,364 --> 01:12:55,294
The spectral line
of neutral hydrogen

957
01:12:55,333 --> 01:12:57,798
has a frequency of 1,420 MHz

958
01:12:57,837 --> 01:13:00,705
and a wavelength
of 21 centimeters.

959
01:13:03,575 --> 01:13:07,178
Two lines, 38 increments east.

960
01:13:07,779 --> 01:13:09,080
And 22 north.

961
01:13:09,715 --> 01:13:12,712
And then you multiply both
by 9,433.

962
01:13:12,751 --> 01:13:14,618
And then by 21 centimeters.

963
01:13:15,487 --> 01:13:18,089
The wavelength is the unit
of the measurement.

964
01:13:18,489 --> 01:13:19,891
It is coordinates.

965
01:13:38,476 --> 01:13:41,045
Lee? Lee?

966
01:13:50,253 --> 01:13:52,822
Uh. I need to use your car.

967
01:13:53,823 --> 01:13:56,259
Please? I've only got
one hour until three.

968
01:14:00,330 --> 01:14:01,330
Go, man.

969
01:14:01,831 --> 01:14:03,032
Go for it.

970
01:14:13,675 --> 01:14:16,078
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

971
01:14:53,881 --> 01:14:58,018
We are servants rather than
masters of Mathematics.

972
01:14:58,552 --> 01:15:02,189
Remember when I told you
that 9,433 was a prime number?

973
01:15:02,355 --> 01:15:03,591
Yes.

974
01:15:04,125 --> 01:15:06,354
<i>That would
be significant, wouldn't it?</i>

975
01:15:06,393 --> 01:15:07,794
Derek?

976
01:15:10,330 --> 01:15:12,232
What do you think
they would look like?

977
01:18:44,769 --> 01:18:46,304
Here's the key, sir.

978
01:18:53,677 --> 01:18:55,207
Will you gentlemen excuse us,
please?

979
01:18:55,246 --> 01:18:56,914
Yes sir.

980
01:19:00,151 --> 01:19:02,186
Let's get those off of you.

981
01:19:32,714 --> 01:19:35,050
The sighting at CVG
wasn't the first.

982
01:19:35,985 --> 01:19:37,286
There were others.

983
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:41,591
And every time we tried
to establish contact with them

984
01:19:41,623 --> 01:19:45,060
using a variation of
the Arecibo signal, we failed.

985
01:19:50,132 --> 01:19:53,068
They put the fine-structure
constant in their message

986
01:19:53,634 --> 01:19:55,903
to build a common
mathematical language.

987
01:19:59,108 --> 01:20:00,442
Uh...

988
01:20:00,775 --> 01:20:03,645
I didn't know it could be used
for determining intelligence.

989
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:07,009
In the new signal
we received today,

990
01:20:07,048 --> 01:20:09,116
there are 19 decimal places.

991
01:20:09,183 --> 01:20:11,352
We can only measure it to 12.

992
01:20:12,253 --> 01:20:15,523
<i>And this one is much more complex
than anything we've seen.</i>

993
01:20:15,890 --> 01:20:19,126
<i>The last one was 14-bit,
but this one is 42-bit.</i>

994
01:20:19,327 --> 01:20:21,790
<i>And not only is it laid out
on a grid,</i>

995
01:20:21,829 --> 01:20:23,497
<i>it's three-dimensional.</i>

996
01:20:24,966 --> 01:20:28,230
Which tells us
a couple of things. One...

997
01:20:28,269 --> 01:20:30,471
They're a hell of a lot
smarter than us.

998
01:20:32,373 --> 01:20:35,642
And two,
when we're trying to find them,

999
01:20:36,643 --> 01:20:38,611
we might be off by a lot.

1000
01:20:40,380 --> 01:20:43,077
In their first signal, they sent
two-dimensional coordinates

1001
01:20:43,116 --> 01:20:44,312
here on Earth.

1002
01:20:44,351 --> 01:20:46,180
In this new signal,
I believe they sent...

1003
01:20:46,219 --> 01:20:48,555
Three-dimensional
coordinates in space.

1004
01:20:49,623 --> 01:20:53,687
Well, the focus of research now
is not that it changes

1005
01:20:53,726 --> 01:20:58,430
throughout the universe,
but that it changes over time.

1006
01:21:02,902 --> 01:21:07,005
Okay, so we have to work out a more
accurate way of measuring the FSC.

1007
01:21:09,241 --> 01:21:13,010
Which means developing new
technologies, new theories.

1008
01:21:14,213 --> 01:21:18,282
And that could take five years
or 500.

1009
01:21:19,351 --> 01:21:21,385
Or five months, with your help.

1010
01:21:26,724 --> 01:21:28,993
And you do understand
what this means?

1011
01:21:37,669 --> 01:21:39,002
We're not alone.

1012
01:21:51,949 --> 01:21:54,279
And then there's this story you
may have already heard about.

1013
01:21:54,318 --> 01:21:56,981
United Airlines employees who swear
it was something other-worldly

1014
01:21:57,020 --> 01:22:00,351
in the skies above Chicago's
O'Hare Airport on November 7th,

1015
01:22:00,390 --> 01:22:02,987
but neither the FAA,
nor indeed their own employer,

1016
01:22:03,026 --> 01:22:04,589
appears to be
taking them seriously.

1017
01:22:04,628 --> 01:22:07,057
Chicago Tribune, <i>interviewing</i>
<i>several people anonymously,</i>

1018
01:22:07,096 --> 01:22:10,261
<i>including maintenance workers,
baggage handlers and pilots,</i>

1019
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:14,031
<i>who each have all described
a dark gray, saucer-like object</i>

1020
01:22:14,070 --> 01:22:16,066
<i>that hovered low
over Concourse C</i>

1021
01:22:16,105 --> 01:22:18,969
<i>of the United Airlines terminal
just before sunset</i>

1022
01:22:19,008 --> 01:22:21,738
<i>before shooting off into the sky.
Some say it moved so fast,</i>

1023
01:22:21,777 --> 01:22:23,907
<i>it literally punched a hole
in the clouds.</i>

1024
01:22:23,946 --> 01:22:26,210
<i>United Airlines claims it had
no record of the sighting,</i>

1025
01:22:26,249 --> 01:22:28,684
<i>even though employees say
they filled out reports.</i>

1026
01:22:28,750 --> 01:22:31,013
<i>The FAA initially told</i>
<i>the</i> Tribune

1027
01:22:31,052 --> 01:22:33,450
<i>that it likewise had
no information on the UFO.</i>

1028
01:22:33,489 --> 01:22:35,686
<i>Then, after the newspapers
filed paperwork under</i>

1029
01:22:35,725 --> 01:22:38,721
<i>the Freedom of Information Act,
the FAA turned up a call from</i>

1030
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:41,991
<i>the United Airlines supervisor
to the airport control tower</i>

1031
01:22:42,030 --> 01:22:46,462

And now, the agency has concluded</i>

1032
01:22:46,501 --> 01:22:48,736

"weather phenomenon,"</i>
