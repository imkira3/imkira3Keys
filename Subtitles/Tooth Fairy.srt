1
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,850
There's a battle on the boards with
both teams really digging for the puck.

2
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,480
Now it squirts loose,
and the Ice Wolves have it.

3
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:54,190
And here they come!

4
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:56,020
What a hit!

5
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,890
Come on, boys, use the body!

6
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:00,970
-Take him wide, take him wide!
-Rapton's flying up the ice.

7
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:02,860
Take him to the outside! Here we go.

8
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,270
He shoots! Nice save by Drah.

9
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,370
What a hit!

10
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,770
What action, eh, Hank?

11
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,900
-The Ice Wolves are just getting hammered.
-Oh, no.

12
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,810
Tooth, Tooth, Tooth!

13
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,210
-There's a familiar chant, Jim.
-Thompson.

14
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:23,050
And the coach is calling for
the big defenseman, Derek Thompson.

15
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,320
And here comes the Tooth Fairy.

16
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:28,260
Find a dark jersey and hit it!

17
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,690
Tooth, Tooth, Tooth!

18
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,940
That is an incisor!

19
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:24,140
I got the tooth.
I got the tooth, baby! Yeah!

20
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:29,650
And the Tooth Fairy, Derek Thompson,
has struck again.

21
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,390
You can't handle the tooth.
And that's the tooth...

22
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:44,500
...the whole tooth,
and nothing but the tooth.

23
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:47,470
I pledge allegiance to the tooth.

24
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:51,070
Open the door for the Tooth Fairy.

25
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:55,040
Penalty on number 14, Derek Thompson.

26
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:58,980
-Five-minute major for boarding.
-Yeah!

27
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:02,950
Who's the Tooth Fairy?
Am I the Tooth...? I'm the Tooth Fairy!

28
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,360
Stop it. Stop it.

29
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:09,590
Yeah, no, I'm not scared, you know.
I play hockey.

30
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,290
We'll go out, have a good time,
see what we make of it.

31
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:14,190
-What's going on out here?
-Come here.

32
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,490
I want you to meet
the future of our franchise.

33
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:17,860
-New kid.
-Yeah.

34
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,100
He's not gonna be here long
till he gets snapped up by the Kings.

35
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:25,870
But listen, while he is here,
your job on the ice is to take care of him.

36
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:28,450
-Okay. All right.
-Nothing else matters, right?

37
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:29,710
-Mick?
-Yeah.

38
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,820
Derek, Mick Donnelly, our first-line center.
Mick, Derek. He's your bodyguard.

39
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,680
-What's up?
-Welcome to pro hockey.

40
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,850
Yeah, is there an old-timers' game today?

41
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:41,460
I didn't realize you were even still playing,
man. I used to be a big fan.

42
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,660
All right. See you later, man.

43
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,360
So I guess that's my bodyguard.

44
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:49,690
-Crazy.
-He's a big one.

45
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,600
Yeah, he's a big guy.

46
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:57,100
-Hello, Mr. Thompson!
-Mr. Thompson.

47
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,040
Tooth Fairy!

48
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,710
Can I have your autograph?

49
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,750
Yeah, sure. Absolutely.
What's your name, buddy?

50
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,440
Gabe. I'm the third-leading scorer
in my hockey league.

51
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,680
Our team won
the Mighty Mite's Championship.

52
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:12,050
Wow, that's fantastic.
Good for you, Gabe.

53
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,990
One day, I'm gonna play hockey
in the big leagues just like you used to.

54
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:22,520
-You work pretty hard at hockey, do you?
-I play almost every day.

55
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,530
And I drive him almost every day.

56
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,640
-How old are you?
-I'm 8.

57
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:29,370
You're 8. You're 8.
Okay, well, here's the deal, Gabe.

58
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:33,670
You're 8 and you're the third-leading scorer
in your league behind two other 8-year-olds.

59
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,910
Well, one's 9.

60
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,540
Okay. Well, see, Gabe, somewhere
in this country, there's a 7-year-old...

61
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,380
...playing against 12-year-olds,
and he's outscoring them.

62
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,250
He's killing them, making them wanna
get run over by a Zamboni and die.

63
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:49,860
There are a bunch like that kid in every rink.
When the time's right...

64
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:53,520
...those kids will battle it out and
only a handful of them will get signed.

65
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,560
Now let's say you do make the NHL.

66
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:58,100
You won't...

67
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:01,170
...but let's say you do.
You hit the show right out of college.

68
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:04,140
The show hits you right back.
Before you say "slap shot"...

69
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:08,010
...you're down to the minors with
a blown-out shoulder and nowhere to go.

70
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,740
Listen, lower your expectations.

71
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:15,310
That's how you're gonna be happy.

72
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:19,110
There you go, Gabe.

73
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:30,270
I want to suck your blood.

74
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,300
What? What are you looking at?

75
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:36,070
And laughing at?
Why aren't you afraid?

76
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,270
-Because those are french fries.
-No.

77
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:41,110
I can't eat french fries.

78
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,110
French fries are fatal to vampires.

79
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:52,350
-Hey, I have an idea.
-Can't talk. Still dead.

80
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:58,230
-Mommy, my tooth came out.
-Hey. Yay!

81
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,960
Oh, congrats.

82
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:04,300
-The tooth fairy's gonna visit me tonight.
-You bet. Let's see.

83
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,700
You are such a big girl.

84
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:10,000
Hey, hey, hey, I'm the Tooth Fairy.

85
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,040
I thought you said you were a vampire.

86
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,500
You got some inconsistent mythology.

87
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,580
I have a lot of homework.
Can I be excused?

88
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,080
Yeah.

89
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,790
Mommy, it's time for you to go now
so Derek can start babysitting.

90
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,290
Not just yet.
Wanna go put your jammies on?

91
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:37,560
I wonder if it would help if Randy
and you had some one-on-one time.

92
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:41,330
Sure, I could do that. So long as
I don't have to be alone with him.

93
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,640
Well, Rene's here. Oh, a little ketchup.

94
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,220
-Oh, tooth fairy.
-You know what? I got it.

95
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:57,150
Look, I put on my pajamas.

96
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:00,680
Dracula's back from the dead.

97
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,920
And your french fries
are not powerful enough.

98
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:09,330
-What do you guys think of Donnelly?
-Man, that kid is fast.

99
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,500
-You mean the next Gretzky.
-I love him already, like a long-lost brother.

100
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,840
-Can we just play?
-It's to you.

101
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:19,700
-I'm a little short.
-He's a little short.

102
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:24,910
But this autograph that says
"The Tooth Fairy"...

103
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,140
...is worth 10 bucks on eBay.
Ten of these is 100 bucks, so I'm in.

104
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,850
-No, you gotta pay.
-It's not a socialist game, Castro.

105
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:34,720
Hey, it's me. I'm good for it.

106
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,020
I'll be right back.

107
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,190
-He took his cards.
-Is this guy serious?

108
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:42,770
-Just fold so we can play.
-Who takes the cards?

109
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:45,670
Don't the kids have, like,
a piggy bank or something?

110
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,420
-I'm home!
-Hello, gorgeous.

111
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:02,750
-Hey.
-Hi, guys.

112
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,760
-Hey, Vinnie's? Some brews?
-Let's do it, boys. Come on.

113
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:07,620
All we have is juice box here.

114
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:11,390
Know what, I'm a little tired. I'm gonna
hang out, but I'll walk you guys out.

115
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,430
Mommy! Mommy!

116
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,760
Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!

117
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,800
-What happened, honey?
-My tooth is gone.

118
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:24,410
Well, that's because
the tooth fairy took it.

119
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:27,770
But there's no money. I looked.

120
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:31,070
Let's look together.
I'm sure it's here somewhere.

121
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:35,150
-The vampire has returned.
-Not a vampire moment.

122
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,850
-It's not anywhere.
-Well...

123
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,390
I bet they took it to weigh it...

124
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,690
...on the toothometer
to see what it's worth...

125
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,690
...before they bring the money. Right?

126
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,330
Sure. That's how the whole
tooth thing works.

127
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,770
No. That's not how it works.

128
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:56,340
You put the tooth under your pillow,
the tooth fairy flies into your room...

129
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,500
...when you're sleeping, takes the tooth...

130
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,010
...and leaves a dollar. Where is it?

131
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:06,110
Okay. You tell me when to stop
when the tooth fairy has been here.

132
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:09,880
-Because I have 5, 10. I even got a 20.
-Derek.

133
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:12,050
Stop.

134
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:16,290
Okay, Tess, you're a big girl now.

135
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,450
You're 6. Let's get this out of the way.

136
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,760
There's no such thing as a too...

137
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:24,360
-Here it is.
-How did it get down there?

138
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,730
Oh, you must have rolled over
in your sleep and it fell on the floor.

139
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,910
I forgot. People forget.

140
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,540
So your big idea to handle it
was to tell Tess there is no tooth fairy?

141
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,090
Come on. The reason why there
are so many unhappy people in the world:

142
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,250
They're clinging to some version
of what if.

143
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,580
Okay, so dreams are bad?

144
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,390
If they lead to unrealistic
expectations, then yes.

145
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,990
-This is ridiculous.
-I know.

146
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,260
-I'm going to bed.
-No. Carly.

147
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:55,590
And you...

148
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:57,430
...are leaving.

149
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:00,030
-Don't get all dramatic.
-I'm her mother.

150
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:03,200
I get to say when her
childhood fantasies end, not you.

151
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:39,270
What?

152
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:46,050
"Disbelief in fairy. Summons."

153
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,220
What? What?

154
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,160
Yes.

155
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,630
Thompson? Derek Thompson?

156
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:21,910
Yes. Yes, God. It's me.
Is that you, God?

157
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,750
You're Thompson?

158
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,910
You're God?

159
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,680
No, I'm Tracy. I'm your caseworker.
What is this?

160
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,520
How disappointing.

161
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:33,990
Come with me, please.

162
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:38,290
No, thank you. Thank you.
Fairy Krishnas.

163
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,930
What are you wearing?

164
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:43,260
L... I don't know what I'm wearing.
What are you wearing?

165
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,430
-Who is this guy?
-Dream killer. I don't like your sort.

166
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:49,240
What'd I do? Why am I here?

167
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:51,310
-Where am I?
-No one likes your kind here.

168
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:55,140
No one likes your attitude. The way you
show up acting strange. "Why am I here?

169
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:59,010
-What are these giant wings?"
-Hey, hey! Do we have a problem?

170
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:02,180
Yeah, we have a problem.
You just said, "Do we have a problem"...

171
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:04,220
...which has given us a problem.
-Right.

172
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,380
-Tracy, right?
-Yeah.

173
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,190
-What a pretty girl's name you have.
-Don't laugh at that.

174
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,890
That's strike two.
You don't wanna get to strike three.

175
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:14,290
-Oh, yeah? What happens after strike three?
-Strike four.

176
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:16,200
Yeah.

177
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:19,960
We'll get your uniform sorted out
and then we can get you registered...

178
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,540
...and begin your training.
-Training for what?

179
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:27,040
"Training for what?" You, Mr. Thompson,
are gonna spend some time...

180
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:29,410
...as a tooth fairy.

181
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,580
Yeah.

182
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:36,580
"As a tooth fairy."

183
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:41,590
Someone get him, please.
Calm down, everyone.

184
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,160
He's relatively harmless.

185
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:45,960
-Everyone all right?
-Really? What are you, fairy patrol?

186
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:49,500
I'm 230 pounds of man. It's gonna
take more than eight fairies to get me.

187
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:52,300
Get your fairy hands off me.
Is this fairy etiquette?

188
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,100
All right. Okay.

189
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:56,140
-Where were we?
-Help! Wake me up!

190
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:59,180
I'm in a nightmare! Please!
Please, help me!

191
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,970
The nightmare's just beginning, buddy.

192
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,950
You want a shot at the title?

193
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,350
Is that it? You feeling lucky...

194
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,950
...punk?
-Hey.

195
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,120
Maybe I am. Hold these, baby.

196
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:18,350
I can't see anything, give them back.
That... It was a stupid idea.

197
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:22,160
Oh, yeah. You want a piece of this, huh?
I'm ready to go.

198
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,460
Hey.

199
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,200
You just made a big mistake.

200
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:29,130
No.

201
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:30,940
Please. You got a magic wand.

202
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:33,170
You gonna pull a rabbit out of the hat?

203
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:35,040
Fairy fight!

204
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:38,550
-Let's not get carried away.
-Now I got one too.

205
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,710
I'm gonna introduce you to
the Hammer brothers, Sledge and Jack.

206
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:44,880
Who do you want?
Who do you wanna meet?

207
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,460
-I can't see. Can't see.
-Oh, dear.

208
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:50,360
It looks like you picked on the wrong fairy.

209
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,860
I can see. Oh, magic wand.

210
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:57,360
Oh, my gosh,
the magic wand go bang-bang.

211
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,660
What is going on here?

212
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:11,020
-I'll tell you what's going on.
-The sugar-dumb fairy showed up.

213
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,480
He was gonna introduce me...

214
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:14,980
...to the Hammer brothers.
-They're still in town.

215
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:18,020
Stop it! You're behaving like leprechauns.

216
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:20,320
He has got such a major attitude problem.

217
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:23,590
Oh, I'm well aware of his attitude,
believe me.

218
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,060
-Hello, Mr. Thompson.
-Hi.

219
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:28,830
Sorry about the foul-up with your outfit.

220
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,440
Budget problems.
Tracy will take care of it.

221
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,590
Who, him? Yeah, sure. Great.

222
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:38,510
You, sir, are guilty
of disseminating disbelief.

223
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,800
Killing dreams.

224
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,850
Committing first-degree murder
of fantasy...

225
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:45,280
...which by fairy law...
-Wait, is this because...

226
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:47,880
...of what happened with Tess? Listen...
-Excuse me.

227
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:51,420
I hadn't finished speaking. Did I look
as though I had finished speaking?

228
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:53,620
Don't know.
Everybody's got British accents.

229
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:57,920
You just interrupted me again while
I was admonishing you for interrupting me.

230
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,590
Do I not look official enough?

231
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:03,260
I don't understand...

232
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,230
...why policemen or firemen
don't get interrupted...

233
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:10,310
...but you add a pair of wings and
suddenly all manners go out the window.

234
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,740
Shouldn't you be more in awe
of somebody with wings than without?

235
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:18,220
You have no idea what I'm capable of.

236
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:22,250
I could just fly up into the air
and do something crazy.

237
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,450
Maybe I breathe fire.

238
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,110
You don't know.

239
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:32,960
I'm sorry for interrupting you.
I didn't mean it.

240
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:35,800
That is better.

241
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:38,070
In order to pay your debt to humanity...

242
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,900
...you are hereby ordered
to serve time as a tooth fairy.

243
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:44,800
The normal sentence is one week...

244
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:48,640
...but because you have the nerve,
the unmitigated gall...

245
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:51,610
...to actually call yourself
a tooth fairy...

246
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:54,840
...thus make a mockery
of everything we stand for...

247
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:59,080
...l'm sentencing you
to two weeks' tooth-fairy duty.

248
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,280
No, no, no. It's unfair. No.

249
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:04,690
-Interrupting.
-Interrupting again. Unbelievable.

250
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:08,820
Take him away. See that he's properly
outfitted and get him into flying school.

251
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,490
I'm sorry, what?

252
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:14,800
Oh, but first, you get to meet Jerry.

253
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:19,540
Excuse me, Fairy Godmother?
I have one last question.

254
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:23,910
Does this tutu make my butt look big?

255
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:27,950
Yes.

256
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:30,950
Huge.

257
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:34,650
Egg on the face.

258
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:37,520
-No, don't. No.
-Come on.

259
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,590
-All right.
-Good. You got the male version.

260
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:48,170
-Give us a spin so I can see.
-How about I give you a spin with my fist?

261
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,000
-What does that mean?
-It's a threat.

262
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:52,870
-It sounds like you're gonna...
-I'll punch you in the nose.

263
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,480
-You should have said that. Clearer.
-What's that?

264
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:58,450
That is just pathetic. Just like a child.

265
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,180
Chicken is fine.

266
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:02,050
I don't hate your chicken.

267
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:04,650
I like your chicken. I hate your brisket.

268
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,220
Yeah, I'm coming. Goodbye.

269
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:10,560
Never marry a leprechaun.
Oh, the dream-popper.

270
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:12,990
Hey. Did it make you feel good
to lie to that kid?

271
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:15,830
-I didn't lie.
-You told the kid there was no tooth fairy.

272
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,230
-Right.
-Liar.

273
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,800
-Look, I'm sorry l...
-"Sorry" is a beginning.

274
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:23,070
Now, if you're gonna be a fairy,
you gotta be ready.

275
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,000
Although...

276
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,310
Yeah.

277
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,240
Dude, there is a pill.

278
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,110
I mean, an amazing pill.

279
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:37,220
You take this pill,
you don't have to do any of this.

280
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,990
-Really?
-No, I was just kidding.

281
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,320
You're mad. You believed,
then I took it away.

282
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:46,020
Be mad at me, I don't care. I have tenure.
Come on, walk with Jerry.

283
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:50,000
Okay, here's your tool pouch.
Waterproof. A lot of compartments.

284
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,530
You can get a lot of stuff in there.
You dig?

285
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,730
-Yeah.
-Okay. This...

286
00:18:56,140 --> 00:19:00,010
This is your wand. Tooth detector, radar
jammer. Keeps picking up Radio Caliente.

287
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,270
-I don't know what that's about.
-What's that?

288
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:03,740
Magic generator button.

289
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:07,350
Does whatever you want it to do.
But you have to believe or it won't work.

290
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,180
So it's pretty much useless to humans.
And this.

291
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,760
You don't ever wanna lose this.

292
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:16,490
-What is it?
-Well, it looks like an iPod adapter.

293
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:19,430
-Right, so, what is it?
-It's an iPod adapter.

294
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:21,360
What's it for?

295
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:23,230
Listening to your iPod.

296
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:26,970
You get a free iPod.
Did you not ask for your free iPod?

297
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,540
-No. Really?
-I'm just kidding.

298
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,270
Yeah, why do you keep doing that?

299
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,100
I'm not well. I actually
just have a few months to live.

300
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,110
-Oh, you're kidding.
-Of course. Would I share that with you?

301
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:40,220
I just met you. Plus, you lie to kids.
Come on, we got business to do.

302
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:42,680
Invisibility spray.

303
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:45,080
Use it, nobody can see you
except other fairies.

304
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:48,690
And this, dude, trust me.

305
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:52,390
Shrinking paste.
You put a little on your tongue...

306
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,120
...you shrink down
to about 6 inches tall.

307
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,800
You wanna do it?
Come on, let's do it together.

308
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:00,160
Come on, we'll jump
into each other's hands.

309
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:03,870
-I don't wanna jump into your hands.
-Really? Come on. Let's get small.

310
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,370
Sometimes when I'm home
with the wife, right...

311
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,840
...l'll take a double hit.

312
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:10,640
I get down to that big.
My feet dangle in the inkwell.

313
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:13,510
Then when she's out,
I walk all over her body.

314
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:17,050
When she wakes up, there's footprints
all over. She goes, "What is this?"

315
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:20,490
I go, "Hey, I don't know."
See, when you're married a long time...

316
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,020
...you do stuff like this.

317
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:24,150
All right, let's see. What else?

318
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:26,800
Would you like a mint?
I made them myself. Here.

319
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:30,330
Taste them. Come on. Really good.

320
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,700
Go ahead. Taste it.

321
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:34,070
-Yeah, sure. Great.
-Help yourself.

322
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:37,200
These are good.

323
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,510
Yeah, these are good.

324
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:46,380
-Dog-bark mints. Comes in very handy.
-For what?

325
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,750
Cats, mailmen,
dogs that come up behind you.

326
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,680
-Or if a kid you lied to comes after you.
-How many times...

327
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:54,420
...I gotta say I'm sorry about that?
-Six times.

328
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:00,160
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

329
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:01,800
I'm sorry. I'm...

330
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:05,200
I'm sorry, I was just kidding.
I can't believe you did this.

331
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:08,170
Did you play without a helmet
or something? What is with you?

332
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:11,740
It's like your brain is in a penalty box,
I'm telling you. And you got...

333
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:14,670
...the eyes of a shark, but, like...

334
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:17,540
...deader. All right, listen.

335
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,980
Cat Away. Important.
If you're not a cat person...

336
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:22,710
...this thing will come in very handy.
Yeah.

337
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:25,920
I almost had a senior fairy moment.
Don't you move.

338
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,090
This is my greatest invention ever.

339
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:38,360
Amnesia dust. Throw a pinch, the kid
forgets everything for the last few seconds.

340
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,970
Yeah, right. Come on.

341
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,870
-That's how it works.
-How what works?

342
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:46,410
Amnesia dust. Throw a pinch, the kid
forgets everything for the last few seconds.

343
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,310
-That's how it works.
-How what works?

344
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,380
Amnesia dust. Throw a pinch, the kid
forgets everything for the last few seconds.

345
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:54,580
-That's how it works.
-How what works?

346
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:55,780
Never gets old.

347
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,520
You wanna fly, you gotta believe.
But you gotta learn to use your wings.

348
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:03,460
"Use my wings." You know
how ridiculous you sound right now?

349
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:06,120
Who's your hobbit friend over here?

350
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:10,260
Wait. You stay here, okay?
You have to learn from the best.

351
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:14,500
And some dang fool
accused this guy of being the best.

352
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:18,400
Me and flying is just not gonna happen.
I've got an old hockey injury...

353
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,440
...so I probably got a bad wing.

354
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:23,510
-That's one I never heard before.
-How's it going?

355
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,340
What's up, man?
Want me to turn He-Man into Peter Pan?

356
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:29,890
-Don't get me started, homey.
-What is that? Your secret fairy jiving?

357
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:33,150
Maybe you didn't hear me.
I said I've got a bad wing. I can't fly.

358
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:37,090
-Put me down!
-D.O. D?

359
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,590
-Yeah.
-I'm cranking this baby up.

360
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,430
Put me down.

361
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,690
I think you're ready
to practice the F.O. A!

362
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:47,390
F.O. A?

363
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:48,800
What's F.O. A?

364
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:51,640
Flying object avoidance.

365
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:54,710
I throw something at you,
you get out of the way, okay?

366
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,470
You better not throw anything at...

367
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:01,120
-You wanna get in on this, Tracy?
-Put me down!

368
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:04,950
Lmagine these are your responsibilities
and you're avoiding them.

369
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,210
-Bring it on!
-Wimbledon!

370
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,130
It's Hammer brother...

371
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:18,200
Raise your right hand, repeat after me.
I, fill in your name.

372
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,230
-I, Derek Thompson.
-Swear to uphold and perform.

373
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:27,740
Swear to uphold and perform.

374
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:30,570
The duties, responsibilities
and obligations.

375
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:34,250
The duties, responsibilities
and obligations.

376
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,510
Of a tooth fairy.

377
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:40,760
Of a tooth fairy.

378
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,270
-Of a tooth fairy.
-And that I will not drink and fly.

379
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,490
Drink and fly?

380
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:55,160
Okay, no, that's serious. That's serious.

381
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,330
That I will not drink and fly.

382
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:01,910
Welcome aboard. These coupons
are redeemable at the gift shop.

383
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,610
Maybe I could have a fairy bumper sticker.

384
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:07,320
All right, I concede. It's real.

385
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:09,510
-Fairies do exist.
-It's too late.

386
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:12,280
-Your sentence begins tomorrow.
-No, no, no.

387
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:16,760
No. There's gotta be a way
to postpone this, like jury duty.

388
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:19,860
I'm sure up here you have fairy duty
or whatever it is you have.

389
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:24,020
I've got a coach breathing down my neck.
I gotta patch things up with my girlfriend.

390
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,240
The interrupting thing. I'm sorry.

391
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:32,770
Any assignment you miss,
you get another week.

392
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:35,070
And if you fail your terms of service...

393
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:39,620
...or tell anyone you're a tooth fairy,
your time will be extended indefinitely.

394
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:42,220
-Oh, really? I'm not leaving.
-Goodbye, Mr. Thompson.

395
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,720
No.

396
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:07,710
I'm sorry.

397
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,710
For what?

398
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:13,320
What I said last night.

399
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:16,210
Which part?

400
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:20,520
All the parts that deeply offended you.

401
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:24,020
Okay? Everything I've ever said...

402
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,990
...or thought. Even before I met you.

403
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:45,210
-Wanna come in?
-Oh, yeah.

404
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:48,410
You can spend
that one-on-one time with Randy.

405
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,520
Yeah.

406
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:58,360
Let me go to my car and get something,
and I'll be right back.

407
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,560
Me and Randy.

408
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:03,660
All right. Yeah.

409
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:22,450
-I didn't know you could shred.
-What do you want?

410
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,750
I brought you a present. Guess what it is.

411
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,020
Is it a puppy?

412
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:31,630
No, wise guy, it's not a puppy.
It's one of my hockey sticks.

413
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,930
And now, after signed, "Your pal...

414
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,660
...the Tooth Fairy"...

415
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:40,440
...now it's worth a lot of money.
There you go.

416
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,900
Okay. I'm just gonna leave it right here.

417
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,780
I bet you get a lot of chicks
with that guitar.

418
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:53,540
-Can we stop this now?
-Stop what?

419
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,050
You're just like
my mom's past boyfriends.

420
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:59,250
-Pretending to be nice to me to impress her.
-No, you're wrong.

421
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:02,920
I'm much better-looking
than your mom's past boyfriends.

422
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:06,630
Big-boy pound
for trying to break the ice.

423
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:10,760
-No? It's going away.
-I have to get back to practice.

424
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:14,300
How about you come over to my place,
I could break out my old drum kit...

425
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:17,640
...you could bring your guitar,
and we could have a jam session.

426
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:20,800
How about I just go tell my mom
you're actually pretty cool...

427
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:24,070
...and you stop trying to bond with me?
-I'll take that deal.

428
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:28,140
So you'll never believe what Randy said
about you after you left.

429
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:31,890
He said that you were
actually pretty cool.

430
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:34,220
Well, I am pretty cool.

431
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:37,220
I'll say.

432
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:41,990
Well, whatever you're doing is working.
So why don't you keep it up?

433
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:56,000
-Who's "T"?
-I have no idea. I don't know.

434
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:58,940
What I do know is I would love for you
to close your eyes...

435
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,140
...because I have an amazing surprise.

436
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,410
-Really? Okay.
-Oh, yeah.

437
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:04,990
-Close your eyes.
-Okay.

438
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,320
All right. Be right back.

439
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:12,290
Is my surprise 6-foot-3
with dark-brown eyes?

440
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:15,360
-Oh, you'll find out shortly.
-I love surprises.

441
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,530
Get ready.

442
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:26,840
Oh, I know you're right in front of me.

443
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:29,480
-Keep your eyes closed.
-Okay.

444
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,040
Don't look. Everything's okay.

445
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:36,210
-Don't peek.
-Okay.

446
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:42,520
-I need some air.
-What?

447
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:44,520
-I'm not feeling well.
-Should I come...?

448
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,960
No! No.

449
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:49,060
-Can you give me some Pepto?
-Of course, where is it?

450
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:51,670
It's upstairs in the bathroom. It's way...

451
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,460
...upstairs.
-Oh, my gosh.

452
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:58,070
-Hello?
-Hello.

453
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,230
-Who is this?
-It's me. It's Tracy.

454
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:02,680
-Tracy who?
-Tracy, your caseworker.

455
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:04,970
Your first assignment
has just fallen asleep...

456
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:08,480
...so get yourself over quick
to 663 Shelter Cove.

457
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:10,810
-I thought that was a dream.
-Think again.

458
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:12,980
-Derek?
-Oh, no! No.

459
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,420
-Where are you?
-Bushes. Don't come any closer.

460
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:18,720
You can't see me like this.
It'll ruin your romantic image of me.

461
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:21,490
Oh, honey. You are so sick.

462
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,430
-Yeah.
-I checked the entire bathroom.

463
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,800
I couldn't find anything.

464
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:29,100
Look underneath the sink.
Underneath the sink.

465
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:31,870
Way back deep underneath the sink.

466
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,200
-Okay.
-Hello?

467
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,640
You heard the rules.
You can't miss an assignment.

468
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:39,280
Plus those wings will stay
until you get that tooth.

469
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:40,940
Oh, man.

470
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,750
You could clean up a little.

471
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,160
My wing.

472
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,480
-Delicate. Well done.
-I can't believe this is happening.

473
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:10,310
It is happening, so get in the house
and fetch the tooth.

474
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,970
No, no. I'm not going anywhere.

475
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:13,950
-Why don't you go in?
-It's not my job.

476
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:17,320
That doesn't make sense. You're a fairy.
You go in and get the tooth.

477
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:19,790
I'm not a winged fairy.
I'm a caseworker fairy...

478
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,720
...which involves more responsibility.

479
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:25,230
There's a lot of filing and putting stuff
in envelopes. It's tricky.

480
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,420
So you're saying
you're not good enough.

481
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,730
-I'm not.
-And they stuck you behind a desk.

482
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,390
No, I'll tell you what they did.

483
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:34,630
There's a lot of wing discrimination
in the workplace. Very funny.

484
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:37,270
-How you gonna get the tooth?
-Maybe I'll wing it.

485
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,310
-Brilliant. How are you gonna get in?
-On a wing and a prayer.

486
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,280
-This is very funny stuff.
-Which wing of the house...

487
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:45,440
...should I start with?
-Want another week?

488
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:48,020
No. No, no.
I don't want another minute of this.

489
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:51,180
So, what do you suggest, Einstein?
I can't fly, so do what?

490
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,260
How about you shrink yourself down
and slide under the door?

491
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:57,330
Just shrink and slide in.
Yeah, that's what anybody would do.

492
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,790
It is, actually, okay?

493
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:04,500
-Is this gonna hurt?
-Let's hope so.

494
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,840
-Come on.
-And how do I get big again?

495
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:12,980
It's automatic. From the moment you shrink,
you start to regrow.

496
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:16,080
It normally takes about an hour.
Come on.

497
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:21,480
I can't believe this.

498
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:23,550
-Eat it.
-Shut up.

499
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:26,350
Down the hatch.

500
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:30,990
Yum, yum, in Derek's tum.

501
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,760
Nice?

502
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,630
Oh, no, no! Wait, wait, wait!

503
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,180
Not so brave now, little wee man.

504
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:51,240
No, no, no!

505
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:54,210
Wing jokes aren't so funny now.
The shoe's on the other foot.

506
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:57,790
-Okay. Okay.
-You should shoe me some respect.

507
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,350
I'll shoe you some respect.

508
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,290
When I get bigger, I'm gonna slap
the glasses off your face!

509
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:05,900
-You "shoe-dn't" upset me.
-Is that the best you got?

510
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,090
Just take the money.

511
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:10,730
Hey, watch it! Don't throw money!

512
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:22,080
My wing. My wing.

513
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,180
Money's heavy. Money's heavy.

514
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:24,740
I hate this. I can't believe...
Oh, my wing. My wing.

515
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:52,160
Okay.

516
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:19,280
No, no.

517
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:22,020
I'm the tooth fairy.

518
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:25,690
The tooth fairy. No, no, no.

519
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,460
It's okay, buddy, we're coming.
Don't worry, sweetheart.

520
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:32,260
What's going on? What is it?
Darling, we're coming.

521
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,840
What's going on? Are you okay?

522
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:38,570
-Honey, what's the matter?
-I saw something.

523
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:41,800
-What did you see?
-It was a little tiny man.

524
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:45,210
Hope you're not hungry.

525
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:49,210
Nice kitty. Don't hurt me, kitty.

526
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:18,450
I'm the tooth fairy!

527
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:22,180
Disappear! Kitty, be gone!

528
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,560
Derek?

529
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:05,630
-Carly?
-Come cuddle with me.

530
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,820
-No.
-What?

531
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,900
-Going to bed. Still not well.
-Hey.

532
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:15,130
I'll call you when I'm bigger.
I mean better.

533
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:19,340
Hello, fans. I'm Steve Levy
coming to you from the wolf den...

534
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:22,840
...here in Lansing, Michigan,
home of the Lansing Ice Wolves.

535
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:26,650
We are about to see
the potentially historic debut...

536
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:28,680
...of an 18-year-old phenom.

537
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:32,690
Mick Donnelly is just about set
to take the ice for the first time.

538
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:34,480
You pumped up for your first game?

539
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,250
Yeah, pops, I'm super pumped.

540
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:39,060
It means one less game
until I'm out and into the bigs.

541
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:40,660
I'm done being generous.

542
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:42,770
This is my kingdom.
You're in my kingdom.

543
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:45,200
I'm the king. You know what you are?

544
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:50,740
You're like one of those little guys in tights
who run around the court in a poofy wig.

545
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:59,510
Mick the Stick! Mick the Stick!
Mick the Stick!

546
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:27,140
Looks like you've been dethroned.

547
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:35,810
This is it. Final minute regulation time.

548
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:38,420
The Ice Wolves lead
the Roughnecks two to one...

549
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:41,060
...and the kid Donnelly
has lived up to the hype.

550
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:43,490
He's still working on that hat trick.

551
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:46,290
The puck comes back to the Roughnecks.

552
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:48,230
There's a quick shot. Nice save.

553
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,770
The puck goes into the corner,
and Donnelly's picked it up.

554
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:55,170
Now he puts on the brakes
and spins out of trouble.

555
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:56,830
Look at him fly, Jim.

556
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:01,470
He fakes another defender,
and here he comes.

557
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:05,580
Donnelly's rushing up the ice.
Look at those moves.

558
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:09,010
He's going through the Roughnecks
like they're a bunch of rented mules.

559
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:11,480
Donnelly circles around
the Roughneck goal.

560
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:14,820
He looks out front to pass.
Now he kicks it off the board.

561
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:22,830
Now Donnelly clears himself off the boards
and takes a pass in the slot.

562
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:25,260
He looks to shoot!

563
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:35,090
No, not now.

564
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:43,780
What a bone-crushing open-ice hit
to Donnelly. And he's down.

565
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:45,980
Thompson was gonna
clear Lembeck out...

566
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:50,920
...and suddenly instead, he just dropped
to the ice. No one even touched him.

567
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:02,040
Hey, Thompson. You cost me a hat trick
and an interview on ESPN.

568
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:06,070
Hey! Get over here.
I wanna talk to you.

569
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:13,680
Hey! What are you doing? Get out here.

570
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:17,650
No, no, I'm very busy right now.
No autographs. I'm busy.

571
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:20,310
Fine. I'll wait.

572
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:22,820
What are you guys talking about?

573
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,750
What the heck?

574
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:27,420
-What's he wearing?
-Check out Thompson's feet, boys.

575
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,630
Derek.

576
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,930
-He looks like a little girl hockey player.
-Disappear.

577
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:39,370
No, no, no.
Either you come out or we're coming in.

578
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:40,910
Yeah.

579
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:44,180
-One.
-This is not good.

580
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:45,780
Two.

581
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:49,220
Three!

582
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:01,890
What happened? Why are you late?
Where have you been?

583
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:04,530
-Don't talk to me. Shut up.
-Why are you wet?

584
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:08,160
-And I hate this job.
-What's that smell? That's intense.

585
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:11,470
I can't breathe. That's too much.

586
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:13,970
It's making my eyes hurt.

587
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:16,040
-Hello.
-Hi.

588
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:19,940
-What the...?
-Mom, I'm home.

589
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:24,650
Where's the kid?

590
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,630
-Be nice. Be respectful.
-I just came out of a toilet.

591
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,630
Do you think I care? Mama fairy.
There is your tooth.

592
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,930
You do whatever it is you do
here in fairy world with your teeth.

593
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:44,440
Mr. Thompson,
according to your caseworker...

594
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:47,170
...you're not exactly embracing
the tooth-fairy spirit.

595
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:49,440
-Really? Is that what my caseworker said?
-No.

596
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:53,170
You called her. Let me tell you something.
My caseworker here has wing envy.

597
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:54,480
-Not true.
-It is true.

598
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:56,780
I am a giant fan of all the administrating.

599
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:58,550
-You hate this job.
-I live for it.

600
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,750
-No, you don't. You hate this.
-Will you two stop it?

601
00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:05,160
Just look at what you have done
to this family.

602
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:09,660
-Who are you?
-Who are you?

603
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:13,260
-I don't know.
-Am I home yet?

604
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:22,640
-It's not funny.
-See the dog? His eyes were like that:

605
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:26,480
-You overdid it.
-Fairy Godmother, who is your supervisor?

606
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:29,310
Who's above you? Gandhi?
Who do I talk to?

607
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:32,510
-I wanna file a complaint now.
-You have another assignment.

608
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:35,490
-Are you kidding me?
-Sometimes there's a double-header.

609
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:38,150
Tell me where the tooth is
so I can get it and go home.

610
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:42,490
Oh, no, not until the child falls asleep.
Till then, I'm afraid you have to wait.

611
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,470
-Come on. I saved you a seat.
-Okay.

612
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:57,640
One kid falls asleep in the afternoon.
Another kid's up all night.

613
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:28,440
Oh, I love a cup of tea.

614
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:33,210
-Good tea?
-Refreshing.

615
00:43:54,370 --> 00:43:55,400
Oh, bull...

616
00:44:00,210 --> 00:44:02,440
Hi. You feeling any better?

617
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:05,580
Yeah, a little bit.
How about you guys come on up?

618
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:07,810
-Hi, Derek.
-Hi, gorgeous.

619
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:11,290
Actually, I have a really big favor to ask.

620
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:13,920
Tess and I
just got a last-minute invitation...

621
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:17,550
-To a beauty makeover party!
-Nice.

622
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:19,420
A beauty makeover party.

623
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:22,360
I was wondering,
because you're getting along so well now...

624
00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:25,500
...if Randy can hang out
with you for a little while.

625
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:30,770
Please?

626
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:35,270
Yeah. Yes. Of course.

627
00:44:35,450 --> 00:44:38,280
Super, thank you.
I'll make it up to you.

628
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:41,750
-Be good. Have fun.
-Bye.

629
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:45,820
That's awesome.

630
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:07,170
I can see hockey's been really good to you.

631
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:15,610
Do you wanna hang with me or
do you wanna go get a beauty makeover?

632
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:23,160
-Pretty cool stuff in here, huh?
-Yeah. Whatever.

633
00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:25,450
Why don't you take one down,
see how it sounds?

634
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:27,390
I don't want to.

635
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:29,500
No, here. Give it a shot.

636
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,700
-Please. Don't.
-Give it a shot.

637
00:45:31,870 --> 00:45:33,800
Let's see how it sounds. Go ahead.

638
00:45:40,810 --> 00:45:44,110
That sounds great. I'm gonna go
check out the drums and the sticks.

639
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:49,180
In the meantime, you just keep practicing
because all that is just awesome.

640
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:09,740
-Hi, Randy.
-Hey, what's up?

641
00:46:09,910 --> 00:46:12,270
-You sound pretty good.
-Thanks.

642
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:15,200
-You gonna play in the talent show?
-Kelly!

643
00:46:15,950 --> 00:46:17,110
There you are.

644
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:18,910
Why you talking to emo boy?

645
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:22,680
-Don't be a jerk, Ben.
-Your dad's waiting. We have to go.

646
00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:26,020
-Bye, Randy.
-Bye.

647
00:46:28,090 --> 00:46:30,620
Don't think about talking to her.
You got it, loser?

648
00:46:30,790 --> 00:46:32,890
-Okay.
-You should put this away...

649
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:34,190
...because you stink.

650
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:40,000
-What are you doing with Randy's guitar?
-I don't know.

651
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:43,400
-So you should give it back to him.
-Okay.

652
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:47,800
Now you can get out of here. Beat it.

653
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:01,820
-You are in trouble now.
-We'll see.

654
00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:05,360
Oh, I know we'll see.
Can you beat two pair?

655
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:07,050
Call me and find out.

656
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:09,490
Big boy puts in
all his big-boy Doodles.

657
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:14,330
Look at that. Me too. I'm not scared
because it's aces over kings.

658
00:47:15,710 --> 00:47:17,570
-Flush.
-No.

659
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:21,400
Yes. Look at all these Doodles,
and they're all mine.

660
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:22,770
-Nice.
-Yeah.

661
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:25,410
-I'm gonna enjoy these.
-Don't rub it in.

662
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:30,250
Can I ask you something?

663
00:47:36,830 --> 00:47:39,390
It's about your body
and how it's changing, isn't it?

664
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:41,790
-What?
-Everything that's happening to you...

665
00:47:41,970 --> 00:47:43,690
...and your body now is natural.

666
00:47:43,870 --> 00:47:45,530
-Are you growing...?
-No. No.

667
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:47,500
-Do you have a funny feeling...?
-Stop.

668
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:50,070
-You'll start to grow...
-No. Stop talking.

669
00:47:50,770 --> 00:47:54,180
-Okay, okay. Well, you...
-That wasn't what I was gonna ask at all.

670
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:55,870
-Okay.
-It wasn't even close.

671
00:47:56,050 --> 00:47:59,950
Okay. All right. Big-boy pound
for not wanting to talk about puberty.

672
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:07,510
Right? Yes, thank goodness. Believe me,
I don't wanna talk about it either.

673
00:48:09,390 --> 00:48:11,830
All right. What's up, seriously?

674
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,390
All right. Well...

675
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:17,190
...there's this talent show
coming up at my school and...

676
00:48:17,370 --> 00:48:18,430
Okay.

677
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:22,260
My mom thinks I should play in it,
and I'm kind of...

678
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:25,060
I don't know.

679
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:28,670
Well, maybe you should play in it.

680
00:48:28,850 --> 00:48:30,070
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

681
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:35,210
Yeah, you will be great. I heard you play.
You're really good, man.

682
00:48:35,990 --> 00:48:38,010
And the chicks, they love guitar players.

683
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:42,920
-We're back!
-Hey, baby. We're up here.

684
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:45,650
Don't tell your mom
I said that about girls.

685
00:48:47,330 --> 00:48:49,160
-Hi, boys. How'd it go?
-Hi.

686
00:48:49,330 --> 00:48:51,320
-Well, your son cheats.
-Does not.

687
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:55,560
-He absolutely does, and you look...
-Gorgeous!

688
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:58,040
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

689
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:01,330
You guys hungry?
How about we get supper?

690
00:49:01,510 --> 00:49:03,270
Love to.

691
00:49:05,850 --> 00:49:07,680
Where's your coat, hon?

692
00:49:10,790 --> 00:49:12,480
Oh, no.

693
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:15,090
-You guys gotta go.
-Is someone hurt?

694
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:17,520
No, not hurt in a way
that you have to be worried.

695
00:49:17,690 --> 00:49:20,220
Both of you look beautiful.
I'll call later. I'm sorry.

696
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,130
-Okay...
-Bye.

697
00:49:22,830 --> 00:49:27,060
Shrinking paste? Nope, not that again.
Amnesia dust? No.

698
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:29,500
Flying? Bad wing, forget it.

699
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:33,800
Oh, hey, and by the way, your
all-purpose magic generator button.

700
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:36,100
It doesn't work. It's broken.

701
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:38,250
Here's an idea, brain-box.
Why don't you...?

702
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:40,850
-Don't touch my pouch.
-All right. That was too much.

703
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:43,710
-What do you want?
-Get out the magical invisibility spray.

704
00:49:43,890 --> 00:49:45,550
Okay? That's relatively idiot-proof.

705
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:47,710
Yeah, I know that.

706
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:55,120
Ignore my last comment.

707
00:50:03,070 --> 00:50:07,840
Hey, what a surprise. It doesn't work.
Your stuff stinks.

708
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,940
Nice.

709
00:50:11,110 --> 00:50:12,670
Shame it wears off.

710
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:24,950
Earthquake.

711
00:50:25,430 --> 00:50:26,860
-Did you hear that?
-Yes!

712
00:50:27,930 --> 00:50:29,590
Ghosts!

713
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:36,870
Are you lost? Can we help you?

714
00:50:38,210 --> 00:50:40,680
How would you like a little amnesia dust?

715
00:50:46,950 --> 00:50:49,610
-Where am I?
-Just go to the white light, my friend.

716
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:51,650
Just go to the white light.

717
00:50:53,620 --> 00:50:54,890
Nice doggy.

718
00:50:56,090 --> 00:50:58,320
Don't hurt me, doggy.

719
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:01,490
What is this?

720
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:06,030
-It's a long and delightful story.
-Where's the tooth?

721
00:51:06,970 --> 00:51:09,000
Can I get a little help here?

722
00:51:11,010 --> 00:51:12,240
That'll be all.

723
00:51:17,350 --> 00:51:20,320
You might just be
the worst tooth fairy ever.

724
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,820
-By the way, I need some more stuff.
-Stuff?

725
00:51:22,990 --> 00:51:25,920
Stuff. The magic powder, the gunk.
I need some. Notify Q.

726
00:51:26,090 --> 00:51:29,320
-No. No more stuff.
-Well, that's brilliant.

727
00:51:29,490 --> 00:51:31,620
I have a week and a half left.
How am I supposed to do that?

728
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:35,230
Sorry, we're running very low on funding.
And would you like to know why?

729
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:37,830
No, not really.

730
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,370
Because children aren't believing
as they used to.

731
00:51:41,970 --> 00:51:44,060
Oh, it's not just us.

732
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:49,580
It's unicorns, leprechauns, dragons,
all those departments. Completely gone.

733
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:51,910
If this trend continues...

734
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:54,710
...Tooth Fairyland will cease to exist.

735
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:58,880
No child will ever again
receive a visit from a tooth fairy.

736
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:02,080
-Ever.
-No more visit from the tooth fairy.

737
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:04,090
So what?

738
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:08,530
You really don't get it, do you?

739
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:10,890
You don't see that children's fantasies...

740
00:52:11,070 --> 00:52:14,370
...their abilities to imagine, are important?

741
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:17,100
Why, it nourishes their very souls.

742
00:52:17,270 --> 00:52:19,870
It's the foundation
that allows them to dream.

743
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:22,600
Dreams are bad. They're bad.

744
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:24,770
They're useless.

745
00:52:27,450 --> 00:52:28,850
-You're done.
-For the week.

746
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:30,450
No, for the night.

747
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:32,350
Unless you wish to stay for fairyoke.

748
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:35,650
Oh, my. No.

749
00:52:37,430 --> 00:52:40,920
Fairyoke. Like karaoke isn't bad enough.

750
00:52:46,870 --> 00:52:48,530
Me?

751
00:52:49,610 --> 00:52:51,400
I got what you need.

752
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:55,640
-What's that?
-The goods...

753
00:52:55,810 --> 00:52:57,440
...the stuff, package...

754
00:52:57,610 --> 00:52:58,770
...the bag, the bomb...

755
00:52:58,950 --> 00:53:02,510
...the juice, the bing, the bang,
the Frisco special...

756
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:04,520
...pink lady, little drummer boy...

757
00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:06,450
-Who are you?
-Ziggy.

758
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:09,460
You can call me whatever you want.
Zigman, Zigmeister...

759
00:53:09,630 --> 00:53:12,420
-Please stop talking.
-You know, they want you to fail.

760
00:53:13,530 --> 00:53:14,930
-What?
-Think about it.

761
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:17,120
You fail, they tack on more time.

762
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:21,100
It's like credit-card debt, man.
They just wanna keep you paying forever.

763
00:53:22,710 --> 00:53:25,040
-Yeah?
-You really wanna play that game?

764
00:53:27,110 --> 00:53:28,600
-So?
-A thousand bucks.

765
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:32,270
-Thousand bucks? You're killing me, Ziggy.
-How bad do you want this to end?

766
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:37,680
Can I write you a check?

767
00:53:45,930 --> 00:53:47,900
Oh, my goodness.

768
00:53:50,030 --> 00:53:52,060
You can see me?

769
00:53:53,170 --> 00:53:54,660
Oh, man. This better work.

770
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:56,960
Oh, no. What is that?

771
00:53:58,170 --> 00:53:59,870
What are you doing?

772
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:13,420
What did Ziggy give me?

773
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:16,490
Big head! Really big head!

774
00:54:18,090 --> 00:54:21,090
-911? 911?
-Just stay calm.
-911? 911?

775
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:23,820
-I just need the tooth.
-There's an alien on my porch.

776
00:54:34,110 --> 00:54:36,170
You are amazing.

777
00:54:36,350 --> 00:54:40,010
Lily is ticked off because she had to
send another fairy to clean up your mess.

778
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:43,210
I learned my lesson.
Never buy black-market stuff.

779
00:54:43,390 --> 00:54:46,720
-I can't go another two weeks without it.
-Yes, you can, friend.

780
00:54:46,890 --> 00:54:49,520
You just have to surrender
to a higher power...

781
00:54:49,690 --> 00:54:53,060
...and take it one day at a time.
-Hello?

782
00:54:53,230 --> 00:54:55,700
Caseworkers decide
who can see us and who can't.

783
00:54:55,870 --> 00:54:58,230
Which you'd know,
if you ever paid any attention...

784
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:02,100
...ever listened to anything I say,
but no. You're always:

785
00:55:02,870 --> 00:55:05,470
-Shut up.
-Hey. My friend.

786
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:07,700
You really need to get yourself cleaned up.

787
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:09,940
If you want, I can give you a pamphlet.

788
00:55:10,110 --> 00:55:12,710
And FYI,
your sentence has been extended.

789
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:14,870
Lily tacked on another week,
so well done.

790
00:55:15,050 --> 00:55:19,420
-Great. Just what I need.
-I think it is what you need, friend.

791
00:55:19,590 --> 00:55:21,920
Listen, I can give you
fresh supplies right now.

792
00:55:22,090 --> 00:55:24,690
On one condition:
From now on, you follow the rules.

793
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:28,560
You embrace the fairy spirit. And
you start listening to old muggins here.

794
00:55:28,730 --> 00:55:31,720
Fine. I'll be the best tooth fairy ever.

795
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:38,230
You keep running out on me
to see l-don't-even-know-who.

796
00:55:38,410 --> 00:55:41,870
And then you never call,
and when I do finally hear from you...

797
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:47,110
...it's to bail you out of jail.
What's going on with you?

798
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:51,510
I wanna tell you, but I can't.

799
00:55:51,690 --> 00:55:54,020
-Why not?
-L...

800
00:55:55,490 --> 00:55:56,690
I just can't.

801
00:55:59,330 --> 00:56:00,760
I know what this is.

802
00:56:00,930 --> 00:56:03,330
This is you acting out.
You're afraid of commitment.

803
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:05,520
You're nervous about us getting serious.

804
00:56:06,770 --> 00:56:08,960
Yes. That's it.

805
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:12,300
You know me so well. I'm nervous
about how serious we're getting.

806
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:14,100
What?

807
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:23,840
You're a woman. And frankly,
you wouldn't understand.

808
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:25,540
What?

809
00:56:26,690 --> 00:56:28,090
No.

810
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:32,520
No, I'm not nervous
about us getting serious.

811
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:35,390
I wouldn't even think about
getting serious with you.

812
00:56:35,570 --> 00:56:36,930
What?

813
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:46,140
I freaked. And, Carly, I love you so much.

814
00:56:46,310 --> 00:56:49,540
I'm scared of messing up
and I'm scared of losing you.

815
00:56:54,380 --> 00:56:55,910
I understand.

816
00:56:56,450 --> 00:56:58,510
I'm so glad you could share that with me.

817
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:01,590
Where can I get some of that?

818
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:05,220
What are you doing?
Are you oiling up your abs again?

819
00:57:05,390 --> 00:57:07,620
-I'm coming!
-Hurry up.

820
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,420
Hey, I've been stepped on...

821
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,190
...flushed, bitten and arrested.

822
00:57:11,370 --> 00:57:14,960
Will you stop complaining?
You promised to embrace the fairy spirit.

823
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:18,400
Oh, I'm embracing the fairy spirit,
all right.

824
00:57:18,570 --> 00:57:20,540
But I'm doing it...

825
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:26,110
...my way.

826
00:57:27,050 --> 00:57:28,780
I'm not sure that's in the rules.

827
00:57:29,390 --> 00:57:31,110
Oh, yeah.

828
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:07,420
I'm just here for the tooth, sir.

829
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:09,650
Just the tooth.

830
00:58:11,290 --> 00:58:13,290
I'll take my glove away.

831
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:17,790
That's it.

832
00:58:19,270 --> 00:58:21,000
Now, just hand over the tooth.

833
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:23,300
Nice and easy.

834
00:58:25,170 --> 00:58:26,730
Let it go.

835
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:28,970
Let it go.

836
00:58:29,450 --> 00:58:30,840
I said, let it go.

837
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:36,150
Very good. You have a good night, sir.

838
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:43,520
Hey.

839
00:58:46,330 --> 00:58:47,820
Who are you?

840
00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:51,020
I'm the tooth fairy.

841
00:58:52,970 --> 00:58:54,940
Oh, yeah.

842
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:05,450
You got it? Let's go. All right, Mick,
how's life in Lansing so far for you?

843
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:07,880
It's been good.
I'm the new blood of the team.

844
00:59:08,050 --> 00:59:11,540
Some of these Wolves are getting
long in the tooth, if you know what I mean.

845
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:14,620
When you say "long in the tooth,"
that would be a reference...

846
00:59:14,790 --> 00:59:16,550
...to Derek Thompson, the Tooth Fairy.

847
00:59:16,730 --> 00:59:19,160
It's not a rivalry, you know.
I respect my elders.

848
00:59:19,330 --> 00:59:22,530
-Has Thompson taken you under his wing?
-No, his wings are tattered.

849
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:25,720
My wings are new and ready to fly,
and I like to do my own thing.

850
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:27,430
A confident, young hockey player.

851
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:29,470
-Good luck this afternoon.
-Thank you.

852
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:33,000
The Ice Wolves dump the puck
and look to make a line change.

853
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:35,170
-Mick, get ready!
-Finally.

854
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:37,710
-Hey, good luck out there, buddy.
-Okay.

855
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:39,940
No, I mean it.
I think you're gonna do great.

856
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:42,850
-You're the bestest hockey player ever.
-Whatever.

857
00:59:43,020 --> 00:59:45,210
-Mick, change, change!
-Hit him, hit him!

858
00:59:45,390 --> 00:59:47,150
-Yeah.
-Come on, Floyd.

859
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,350
Donnelly jumps into the play...

860
00:59:49,790 --> 00:59:52,190
...and takes a cross-ice pass.
The Ice Wolves...

861
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:56,560
...charge across the blue line. Big scrum
in front of the net as these two rivals...

862
00:59:56,730 --> 00:59:59,360
...start to get a little feisty
with each other.

863
01:00:17,190 --> 01:00:19,420
Oh, yeah.

864
01:00:20,620 --> 01:00:22,750
All right. Here we go. Here we go.
Here we go.

865
01:00:23,990 --> 01:00:26,860
The puck goes into the corner,
where Nubin chases it down.

866
01:00:27,030 --> 01:00:29,500
-What's the matter with him?
-What's up with Donnelly?

867
01:00:29,670 --> 01:00:31,430
Get in there, Donnelly! Get in there!

868
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:36,230
The puck squirts loose.
Now Donnelly picks it up...

869
01:00:36,410 --> 01:00:38,740
...skates to the point,
looking to set up a play.

870
01:00:38,910 --> 01:00:41,240
-Bring it up. Bring it up.
-Hi.

871
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:43,750
Donnelly takes a terrible fall.

872
01:00:44,050 --> 01:00:45,950
-What happened there, Jim?
-Who hit him?

873
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:48,080
-Someone hit him?
-Anyone know who hit him?

874
01:00:48,250 --> 01:00:50,510
What is going on?

875
01:00:55,220 --> 01:00:58,090
-What is he doing?
-Stop it.

876
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:01,190
Is he laughing?

877
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:09,300
Donnelly, you okay, kid?

878
01:01:11,170 --> 01:01:12,400
What?

879
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:16,070
-Are you trying to test me, kid?
-Get off the ice!

880
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:19,610
Listen, you wanna play games?
You can head over to the daycare center.

881
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:21,550
Get out of here. Right now. Move it.

882
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:29,210
So, what'd I miss?

883
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:37,560
Why you bark?

884
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:51,350
I'm not gonna be ready.
I'll get up there and blow it.

885
01:01:51,510 --> 01:01:53,780
You'll be fine.
We just gotta keep practicing.

886
01:01:53,950 --> 01:01:56,610
Everyone's gonna laugh at me.
Maybe I shouldn't do this.

887
01:01:56,790 --> 01:01:58,480
Well, maybe they will...

888
01:01:58,650 --> 01:02:02,950
...or maybe you'll blow
the roof off the place, huh?

889
01:02:03,130 --> 01:02:06,960
Man, you're good. But you're
not gonna find out if you quit.

890
01:02:07,830 --> 01:02:10,130
You can't score
if you don't take the shot.

891
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:13,200
Yeah? When was the last time
you took a shot?

892
01:02:19,070 --> 01:02:22,310
Listen, when I first started,
I was a scorer.

893
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:25,170
First-round draft pick of the Devils,
playing in the bigs.

894
01:02:25,350 --> 01:02:28,750
-So, what happened?
-I busted my shoulder one night in Chicago.

895
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:31,850
They sent me down to the minors
to recover, and it took forever.

896
01:02:32,020 --> 01:02:33,490
I got so angry and frustrated.

897
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:36,420
One night, I got into it
with some meathead from New Haven.

898
01:02:36,590 --> 01:02:39,060
Knocked out a couple of his teeth,
crowd went crazy...

899
01:02:39,230 --> 01:02:43,460
...and they started calling me
the Tooth Fairy, and it stuck.

900
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:47,700
And I haven't scored in years.

901
01:02:52,370 --> 01:02:57,040
But I've got more penalty minutes
than anyone else in the league. Yeah.

902
01:02:57,210 --> 01:03:00,340
But, like, isn't your shoulder
all healed now?

903
01:03:00,550 --> 01:03:02,520
It's just not the same.

904
01:03:02,690 --> 01:03:05,380
But how do you know?
You don't even try.

905
01:03:06,990 --> 01:03:09,390
You can't score
if you don't take the shot.

906
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:16,290
I'll tell you what.
I will if you will.

907
01:03:22,940 --> 01:03:24,910
Okay. I'll take that deal.

908
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:29,670
Hey.

909
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:32,810
All right. Thank you.

910
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:35,140
And another tooth.

911
01:03:41,090 --> 01:03:43,680
Hey. That must be good.

912
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:46,790
That moment
when you hand over the tooth.

913
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:50,660
Not that I'm interested.
Just wondering, you know, how it felt.

914
01:03:50,830 --> 01:03:53,890
-Why don't you find out?
-We've been through this. I'm not winged.

915
01:03:54,070 --> 01:03:56,830
Okay. Explain to me one more time.
Why can't you have wings?

916
01:03:57,010 --> 01:04:00,600
-Do you know nothing about fairy evolution?
-Fairy evolution. Who wrote that...

917
01:04:00,780 --> 01:04:02,610
...Charles Darwing?

918
01:04:02,910 --> 01:04:04,470
Inspired. Brilliant.

919
01:04:04,650 --> 01:04:08,010
According to fairy evolution, some fairies
can grow wings and some can't.

920
01:04:08,180 --> 01:04:09,910
And I'm one of the unlucky ones.

921
01:04:10,090 --> 01:04:13,250
Tracy, you don't have to have wings
to be a tooth fairy.

922
01:04:13,660 --> 01:04:17,650
-Hey, remember, you've got all of this.
-That is true.

923
01:04:17,830 --> 01:04:22,920
Somewhere in there, you gotta show them
your strengths. Speed, agility, flexibility.

924
01:04:23,370 --> 01:04:25,330
Right. And how am I gonna do that?

925
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:29,700
Around the cones, around the cones.
Quick feet, quick feet.

926
01:04:37,310 --> 01:04:38,870
No. Come back. Come back.

927
01:04:41,750 --> 01:04:42,770
Where are you going?

928
01:04:42,950 --> 01:04:44,720
-Look at the size.
-Get over the fence.

929
01:04:44,890 --> 01:04:47,820
It's 3 feet high.
You're 8 feet tall. Go back.

930
01:04:53,030 --> 01:04:54,220
-A dinosaur!
-No, it's not.

931
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:55,420
What the heck?

932
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:03,590
Come on. Over the fence.

933
01:05:05,340 --> 01:05:07,070
I'm all right. I'm okay. I'm okay.

934
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:09,180
-You okay?
-No. Good night.

935
01:05:14,150 --> 01:05:15,880
-It's a child!
-Why'd you hit the kid?

936
01:05:16,050 --> 01:05:19,150
They've got matching robes.
It's my worst nightmare.

937
01:05:22,730 --> 01:05:25,090
-Don't drop me.
-Yeah.

938
01:05:25,490 --> 01:05:26,720
I got it. I got it.

939
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:29,520
I'm there. I'm not there.

940
01:05:36,910 --> 01:05:41,070
You look like a beautiful reindeer with
your legs. You're prancing, you're prancing.

941
01:05:43,510 --> 01:05:45,380
Not on the kid, on yourself.

942
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:46,940
Amnesia dust. Amnesia dust.

943
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:03,970
Yeah!

944
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:08,930
Dust, dust, dust. Up.

945
01:06:18,410 --> 01:06:21,440
You sound great.
You're gonna kill them tomorrow night.

946
01:06:21,620 --> 01:06:24,210
So, what do you think?

947
01:06:30,060 --> 01:06:34,790
Nice. That is bigtime.
Randy Harris. Talent show.

948
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:38,160
-I like that slot too.
-You think I could be a famous rock star?

949
01:06:38,330 --> 01:06:40,700
Like Clapton or Hendrix
or Stevie Ray Vaughan?

950
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:44,000
-You want it straight?
-Yeah.

951
01:06:44,170 --> 01:06:44,940
Okay.

952
01:06:47,610 --> 01:06:51,840
You're getting pretty good, right? So
let's say you keep working at it really hard.

953
01:06:52,250 --> 01:06:54,940
Then let's say you become
the best 13-year-old guitarist...

954
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:57,420
...in your neighborhood.
Here's the deal.

955
01:06:57,750 --> 01:06:59,780
Remember there are
a lot of neighborhoods...

956
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:01,820
...with a lot of 13-year-old guitarists.

957
01:07:01,990 --> 01:07:04,550
But somewhere, there's a 12-year-old
who's shredding it.

958
01:07:04,730 --> 01:07:07,060
I mean, he is killing that guitar.

959
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:13,490
Yeah?

960
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:18,660
You know what? Yeah. It's possible.

961
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:21,770
Cool.

962
01:07:22,510 --> 01:07:24,240
Go get them.

963
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:28,010
Late in the third period,
Ice Wolves down four to three...

964
01:07:28,180 --> 01:07:32,450
...to the Arrows. Donnelly is getting
a breather, but having another great game.

965
01:07:32,620 --> 01:07:36,250
The Arrows leading scorer, Crosley,
takes the pass, and he is on the move.

966
01:07:36,430 --> 01:07:37,480
Mickey, your line's up.

967
01:07:37,660 --> 01:07:39,990
All right, old man.
Got a fresh pair of Depends on?

968
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:42,650
You never know, kid.
I just might surprise you.

969
01:07:43,730 --> 01:07:47,170
Ice Wolves dump the puck into
the Arrows' zone, change lines on the fly...

970
01:07:47,340 --> 01:07:49,670
...as the coach throws Donnelly
back in the game.

971
01:07:52,070 --> 01:07:55,570
Allegheny's got the puck in their own zone.
They're crossing the blue line.

972
01:07:55,740 --> 01:07:57,470
Change! Change!

973
01:07:59,380 --> 01:08:02,210
And here comes Thompson off the bench,
replacing Goff.

974
01:08:09,390 --> 01:08:11,380
Thompson knocks Crosley
flat on his back...

975
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:14,790
...and kicks the puck in the neutral zone,
where Browley picks it up.

976
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:19,160
Thompson jumps back into the play
as Donnelly weaves around Crosley.

977
01:08:19,370 --> 01:08:23,930
Now Thompson takes a pass right on
his stick as Donnelly flashes into the play.

978
01:08:24,110 --> 01:08:27,080
It's a two-on-one with Thompson
of all people leading the rush.

979
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:28,370
Pass it!

980
01:08:28,540 --> 01:08:31,540
Donnelly's screaming for the puck,
but Thompson won't give it up.

981
01:08:31,710 --> 01:08:34,200
-Pass.
-Pass it! Pass it!

982
01:08:34,420 --> 01:08:35,440
Pass!

983
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:37,850
Thompson looks to pass.

984
01:08:38,020 --> 01:08:39,950
No, he fakes the pass.

985
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:42,890
He's got the top shelf wide open.

986
01:08:43,060 --> 01:08:45,860
-Mickey's open! Pass it!
-Pass.

987
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:50,420
No!

988
01:08:52,870 --> 01:08:56,240
-What a hit on Thompson.
-What is he thinking?

989
01:09:00,780 --> 01:09:02,870
The Arrows have numbers,
coming up the ice.

990
01:09:03,050 --> 01:09:06,480
-They shoot, they score!
-Damn it.

991
01:09:07,250 --> 01:09:11,580
Jim, it looked like Thompson was
actually gonna shoot, and he just choked.

992
01:09:26,670 --> 01:09:30,630
You're not a hockey player.
You're a sideshow attraction!

993
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:35,100
You know what? Why don't you watch
tomorrow's game from the bench?

994
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:36,740
You bum.

995
01:09:38,010 --> 01:09:43,350
Come on, boys. Come on now. Here we go.
Here we go. Come on, let's start up.

996
01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:50,250
Oh, great.

997
01:10:00,140 --> 01:10:02,400
Hey, honey. How was your game?

998
01:10:02,570 --> 01:10:04,870
-Not good.
-Derek, guess what.

999
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:07,470
-I have another loose tooth.
-Good for you, honey.

1000
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:09,630
-What's the matter, hon?
-Everything.

1001
01:10:09,810 --> 01:10:13,300
-Nothing. You know, forget it.
-Can we go practice now?

1002
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:16,320
Can we skip today's session?
I just don't have it in me.

1003
01:10:16,490 --> 01:10:18,580
-The talent show is tomorrow.
-You'll be fine.

1004
01:10:18,750 --> 01:10:20,950
-I need one more run through...
-No, you don't.

1005
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:25,060
No, I do need it. I just need a little
more practice. Just so I can get it down.

1006
01:10:25,230 --> 01:10:29,030
It doesn't matter what you do in the show.
You'll never be a famous rock star.

1007
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:32,830
You'll just be another kid with a guitar.
Do yourself a favor and give it up.

1008
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,200
-Derek.
-Look, I'm sorry...

1009
01:10:34,370 --> 01:10:36,560
...but it's for his own good. Trust me.

1010
01:10:39,170 --> 01:10:40,660
No!

1011
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:50,580
Come on, Tess. Tess, let's go.

1012
01:10:50,750 --> 01:10:52,980
-What is wrong with you?
-Look, I had a bad day.

1013
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:54,990
-Had a bad day?
-I had a bad day, okay?

1014
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:56,990
No. No, that is not okay.

1015
01:10:57,160 --> 01:10:59,750
You are never gonna
speak to my children again.

1016
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:01,990
We are done.

1017
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:04,320
Carly.

1018
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:09,200
You know what your problem is, Derek?
You can't say "what if."

1019
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:14,240
And you never will.

1020
01:11:35,930 --> 01:11:38,760
Okay. Okay.

1021
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:43,600
Okay, okay, okay. All right.

1022
01:11:46,010 --> 01:11:48,310
Who wants to hear some good news?

1023
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:51,410
I do. Come on.

1024
01:11:52,950 --> 01:11:56,150
-Why are you here?
-Lily gave me this.

1025
01:11:59,090 --> 01:12:02,150
-Only a permit, but I'm on the way.
-You should be on your way out.

1026
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:04,220
-I'm going to bed.
-It's thanks to you.

1027
01:12:04,390 --> 01:12:07,850
We've gotta celebrate. I know a place
where the hot fairy godmothers hang.

1028
01:12:08,030 --> 01:12:11,360
Are you out of your mind?
I just lost everything that's important to me.

1029
01:12:11,530 --> 01:12:15,160
My girlfriend, those kids,
and I probably hung up my skates for good.

1030
01:12:15,340 --> 01:12:18,670
All because, like an idiot,
I bought into your tooth-fairy garbage.

1031
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:20,170
Look where it's gotten me.

1032
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:24,270
You make one effort
and it doesn't work out...

1033
01:12:24,450 --> 01:12:26,350
...and suddenly
you're just gonna give up?

1034
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:29,640
It's not supposed to be that easy,
and you know it.

1035
01:12:32,250 --> 01:12:37,920
I'll tell you what I do know.
I know that you don't have wings.

1036
01:12:38,090 --> 01:12:40,860
So that means you can't fly.

1037
01:12:41,030 --> 01:12:45,990
That also means that you can
never, ever, ever be a tooth fairy.

1038
01:12:46,170 --> 01:12:50,000
What happens if you try to escape
out a 10-story building? I'll tell you what.

1039
01:12:50,170 --> 01:12:53,570
Splat, just like that.

1040
01:13:01,580 --> 01:13:03,640
You know what's really sad?

1041
01:13:03,820 --> 01:13:06,520
The person you hurt the most
with all your dream-killing...

1042
01:13:06,690 --> 01:13:09,780
...is not Randy or Carly or even me.

1043
01:13:10,060 --> 01:13:11,550
It's you.

1044
01:13:12,830 --> 01:13:15,160
-Get out.
-Fine.

1045
01:13:15,330 --> 01:13:16,520
Good.

1046
01:13:19,470 --> 01:13:21,160
Fine.

1047
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:23,330
I'm going to bed.

1048
01:13:24,310 --> 01:13:26,870
One twenty-four left in the third period...

1049
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:29,810
...with the Ice Wolves
still trailing one to nothing.

1050
01:13:29,980 --> 01:13:33,570
And Derek Thompson is still
completely in the coach's doghouse.

1051
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:37,240
-I don't think he's seen a second of ice time.
-Here we go, here we go.

1052
01:13:37,420 --> 01:13:40,480
As he has all game,
Andreas Petrenko, the Mute Brute...

1053
01:13:40,660 --> 01:13:44,180
...continues to replace Thompson
on the first line.

1054
01:13:44,860 --> 01:13:47,350
Face-off won by the Lumbermen.

1055
01:13:48,260 --> 01:13:49,590
What a hit!

1056
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:53,030
Donnelly steals the puck, and now
he's rushing up the ice short-handed.

1057
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:56,070
-Only Coletta can get back.
-Let's go, Mick. Let's go, Mick.

1058
01:13:59,170 --> 01:14:01,400
This is classic.
Every move Donnelly makes...

1059
01:14:01,580 --> 01:14:03,340
...Coletta's got an answer.

1060
01:14:03,950 --> 01:14:05,610
Donnelly shoots to his left.

1061
01:14:05,780 --> 01:14:08,750
He's got Coletta out of position
and Donnelly moves around him.

1062
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:11,010
He's got the defenseman beat. He shoots!

1063
01:14:12,620 --> 01:14:13,610
Hits the crossbar.

1064
01:14:16,260 --> 01:14:17,920
What happened?
They blew the whistle.

1065
01:14:18,090 --> 01:14:21,030
Back behind the play, Jim,
Petrenko got sucker-punched...

1066
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:22,930
...and I don't think he's getting up.

1067
01:14:31,740 --> 01:14:33,440
Thompson.

1068
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:35,270
Go.

1069
01:14:36,140 --> 01:14:37,840
Go.

1070
01:14:48,460 --> 01:14:49,480
All right, here we go.

1071
01:14:49,660 --> 01:14:51,920
The Ice Wolves have
less than a minute to score...

1072
01:14:52,090 --> 01:14:54,320
...and send this game into overtime.

1073
01:14:55,060 --> 01:14:57,730
Off the face-off,
it's Plattsburgh with the puck.

1074
01:14:57,900 --> 01:15:00,460
And they start their drive
as the clock winds down.

1075
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:05,070
I don't know. It looks to me like Thompson
is just going through the motions out there.

1076
01:15:05,240 --> 01:15:08,770
Oh, my!
Thompson just got leveled.

1077
01:15:08,940 --> 01:15:12,850
How could that not be a penalty?
He just got crushed.

1078
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:19,980
I think the Tooth Fairy
just got a taste of his own medicine.

1079
01:16:30,830 --> 01:16:32,160
Look at Thompson, Jim.

1080
01:16:33,030 --> 01:16:35,500
He looks like he's got some jump
back in those legs.

1081
01:16:35,660 --> 01:16:39,360
Thompson's rushing across the ice,
and I don't think it's to make friends.

1082
01:16:39,530 --> 01:16:40,690
Well, this is gonna hurt.

1083
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:45,570
No! He pulled up, Jim.
He didn't throw a check.

1084
01:16:45,740 --> 01:16:46,930
Incredible!

1085
01:16:47,110 --> 01:16:50,480
He steals the puck and
now is barreling down the ice.

1086
01:16:50,650 --> 01:16:53,340
-Look at him go.
-Ellis can't keep up with Thompson.

1087
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:56,080
He's making moves
we haven't seen in a long time.

1088
01:16:56,250 --> 01:16:57,280
Who is that guy?

1089
01:16:59,050 --> 01:17:01,150
Thompson only has one defender to beat.

1090
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:04,220
He takes the stick to the face.

1091
01:17:04,390 --> 01:17:07,560
-I think he's going down.
-No, he stays on his feet.

1092
01:17:07,730 --> 01:17:09,700
He's gonna shoot!

1093
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:13,000
He shoots!

1094
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:19,970
He scores!

1095
01:17:23,910 --> 01:17:26,440
Yeah!

1096
01:17:29,050 --> 01:17:30,750
Yeah. All right, nice shot.

1097
01:17:38,590 --> 01:17:41,430
Derek Thompson has not taken a shot
in nine years.

1098
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:46,120
In one of the most amazing shots
I've ever seen, it ties it up at one all.

1099
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:49,960
Call me the Mayor of Shockville.
Let's do it again.

1100
01:17:53,540 --> 01:17:55,170
Hey, old man.

1101
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:57,280
Not bad.

1102
01:18:02,350 --> 01:18:04,110
-Yeah, Derek.
-Nice shot, dude.

1103
01:18:04,820 --> 01:18:06,580
Way to go.

1104
01:18:10,290 --> 01:18:12,620
And here we go.

1105
01:18:12,790 --> 01:18:17,560
We're under 20 seconds as both teams
head to the center line for a face-off.

1106
01:18:24,270 --> 01:18:26,070
Oh, no.

1107
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:32,110
The Ice Wolves win the drop.

1108
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:35,440
There's a cross-ice pass
to Thompson, who ices it.

1109
01:18:35,620 --> 01:18:38,520
-Why would he do that?
-I have no idea, Jim.

1110
01:18:38,690 --> 01:18:42,490
No, I can't leave now. This is my
last chance to actually play the game...

1111
01:18:42,660 --> 01:18:44,120
...to go out the way I came in.

1112
01:18:44,290 --> 01:18:47,190
I could cover for you.
After what I've seen, you deserve it.

1113
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:49,630
Thompson, what are you doing?
Who's he talking to?

1114
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:52,200
Aren't you a trainee?
Isn't that breaking the rules?

1115
01:18:52,370 --> 01:18:54,160
Please, I've learned from the best.

1116
01:18:54,540 --> 01:18:57,660
But I do think you should look
at the address before you decide.

1117
01:19:05,080 --> 01:19:06,600
It's Carly's house.

1118
01:19:06,780 --> 01:19:09,180
Hey, 14. Come on. Let's go.

1119
01:19:09,350 --> 01:19:11,220
Thompson, get back in the game.

1120
01:19:11,620 --> 01:19:15,320
-I can go. Lily does not have to know.
-But I'll know.

1121
01:19:17,390 --> 01:19:19,020
This is my house to take care of.

1122
01:19:41,820 --> 01:19:45,220
-Let's do this.
-How? You can't fly.

1123
01:19:45,420 --> 01:19:47,250
Good time to learn.

1124
01:19:47,420 --> 01:19:49,360
I knew you had it in you.

1125
01:19:58,430 --> 01:20:00,260
Go get them.

1126
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:10,980
You wanna fly, you gotta believe.

1127
01:21:11,470 --> 01:21:14,600
No need to panic.
It's just a giant amnesia gun.

1128
01:21:14,780 --> 01:21:17,470
It's painless.
You won't remember a thing.

1129
01:21:21,580 --> 01:21:25,450
Don't you forget about me

1130
01:21:25,620 --> 01:21:27,210
You will.

1131
01:21:28,220 --> 01:21:30,850
Good luck finding your cars.

1132
01:21:55,680 --> 01:21:57,150
Tess?

1133
01:21:58,150 --> 01:21:59,810
Derek.

1134
01:22:00,490 --> 01:22:02,650
-Hi, honey.
-Hi, Derek.

1135
01:22:04,630 --> 01:22:07,060
I like your costume.

1136
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:11,030
I have to tell you something.

1137
01:22:11,700 --> 01:22:13,060
I was wrong.

1138
01:22:13,230 --> 01:22:16,970
The tooth fairy is real...

1139
01:22:17,140 --> 01:22:19,160
...and it's me.

1140
01:22:19,340 --> 01:22:21,140
I know.

1141
01:22:22,310 --> 01:22:25,250
No, honey, I'm not talking about
the hockey Tooth Fairy.

1142
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:29,580
I'm the real tooth fairy.

1143
01:22:30,250 --> 01:22:31,510
No, you're not.

1144
01:22:44,370 --> 01:22:46,800
You are the real tooth fairy.

1145
01:22:46,970 --> 01:22:50,600
-It'll just be our secret, okay?
-Okay.

1146
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:35,810
Randy?

1147
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:40,680
What are you doing here?

1148
01:23:41,890 --> 01:23:43,250
I have to talk to you.

1149
01:23:44,990 --> 01:23:46,580
Go away.

1150
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:50,530
Listen, those things I said yesterday?

1151
01:23:51,170 --> 01:23:52,690
I was wrong.

1152
01:23:54,100 --> 01:23:56,160
I don't care.

1153
01:23:56,500 --> 01:23:59,030
You gotta keep playing guitar.

1154
01:23:59,210 --> 01:24:01,070
You're really good.

1155
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:05,870
And nothing you love doing that much
could ever be a waste of time.

1156
01:24:07,620 --> 01:24:09,880
I'm so sorry.

1157
01:24:23,230 --> 01:24:27,170
Even if I wanted to, I can't.

1158
01:24:27,670 --> 01:24:29,860
I smashed my guitar, remember?

1159
01:24:30,770 --> 01:24:33,040
Tonight is the talent show.

1160
01:24:36,680 --> 01:24:38,440
Hold on one second.

1161
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:57,350
Maybe this'll help.

1162
01:24:59,100 --> 01:25:00,530
It's awesome.

1163
01:25:00,700 --> 01:25:03,100
How...? How did you do that?

1164
01:25:03,270 --> 01:25:05,300
All-purpose magic generator.

1165
01:25:08,110 --> 01:25:10,810
-What are you wearing?
-You'll find out.

1166
01:25:10,980 --> 01:25:14,640
In the meantime, put some clothes on.
We can still make the talent show, okay?

1167
01:25:15,180 --> 01:25:16,840
Come on.

1168
01:25:21,090 --> 01:25:22,560
Derek?

1169
01:25:23,690 --> 01:25:26,890
Mommy, Derek is the tooth fairy.

1170
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:40,230
You rented a fairy costume
to make it up to Tess.

1171
01:25:40,910 --> 01:25:45,900
Yes. That's what I did.

1172
01:25:46,780 --> 01:25:50,410
Hey, Mom. Derek got me a new guitar,
and he's taking me to the talent show.

1173
01:25:50,590 --> 01:25:52,610
What time is it? You'll never make it.

1174
01:25:52,790 --> 01:25:55,260
-It's gotta...
-Don't worry about that. We can make it.

1175
01:25:55,420 --> 01:25:58,980
You, that way. You guys, go up and get
dressed, and we'll see you over there.

1176
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:03,050
Oh, yeah.

1177
01:26:03,230 --> 01:26:05,390
-Where's your car?
-No car. Let's go.

1178
01:26:07,540 --> 01:26:08,970
Hang on!

1179
01:26:12,810 --> 01:26:14,970
-How is this happening?
-It's okay. It's okay.

1180
01:26:15,140 --> 01:26:16,770
Yeah, but like how is it possible?

1181
01:26:16,940 --> 01:26:19,940
It all started one night.
I got a summons underneath my pillow.

1182
01:26:20,110 --> 01:26:22,810
-What is a summons?
-A summons is like an invitation.

1183
01:26:22,980 --> 01:26:25,150
-I got an invitation to Fairyland.
-Fairyland?

1184
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:28,410
It's where I got these wings.
I met this guy up there named Tracy.

1185
01:26:28,590 --> 01:26:31,460
He looks like a walking toothpick
with the eyes of a big tuna.

1186
01:26:31,630 --> 01:26:34,560
By the way,
I can shrink myself down to 6 inches.

1187
01:26:36,630 --> 01:26:38,460
Pretty good.

1188
01:26:44,570 --> 01:26:45,870
What?

1189
01:26:48,310 --> 01:26:51,470
I'm sorry, buddy,
but I've already broken enough rules.

1190
01:27:01,690 --> 01:27:04,520
Randy, there you are.
We've been looking all over for you.

1191
01:27:04,690 --> 01:27:07,090
Get in there and tune up. Come on.

1192
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:09,990
-Another tooth.
-Thank you.

1193
01:27:10,160 --> 01:27:12,260
You're welcome.
I've got a concert to get to.

1194
01:27:12,430 --> 01:27:15,800
No, you skirted quite a few rules
tonight, Mr. Thompson.

1195
01:27:15,970 --> 01:27:18,000
But I took care of Carly,
I dusted Randy...

1196
01:27:18,170 --> 01:27:21,570
...and Tess, she's only 6,
so pretty soon she'll forget.

1197
01:27:21,740 --> 01:27:24,800
And even if she doesn't,
at least now she'll...

1198
01:27:24,980 --> 01:27:26,840
She'll always...

1199
01:27:27,750 --> 01:27:30,550
Always what?

1200
01:27:35,090 --> 01:27:38,250
She will always believe...

1201
01:27:39,090 --> 01:27:40,890
...like I will.

1202
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:46,730
I get it. Dreams are good. For everyone.

1203
01:27:51,570 --> 01:27:53,670
Mr. Thompson...

1204
01:27:55,110 --> 01:27:59,840
...I hereby relieve you of tooth-fairy duty.

1205
01:28:05,190 --> 01:28:07,090
-You're good.
-She's a pro.

1206
01:28:07,720 --> 01:28:09,880
Congratulations.

1207
01:28:10,060 --> 01:28:11,790
Put that away.

1208
01:28:19,900 --> 01:28:22,800
L... I tend not to do
the whole physical contact thing.

1209
01:28:22,970 --> 01:28:24,960
Oh, you like me. I know you like me.

1210
01:28:25,140 --> 01:28:27,770
You do the whole
distant administrator demeanor thing...

1211
01:28:27,940 --> 01:28:30,880
...which I understand,
but somewhere in there, you like me.

1212
01:28:35,220 --> 01:28:36,740
Well...

1213
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:38,540
...let's not get frisky.

1214
01:28:39,790 --> 01:28:43,120
-I really gotta go.
-Yeah. Could you wait just one second?

1215
01:28:43,290 --> 01:28:45,220
Tracy, I need another word with you.

1216
01:28:47,430 --> 01:28:48,550
What's this about?

1217
01:28:48,730 --> 01:28:51,720
Anybody that can rehabilitate
Mr. Thompson...

1218
01:28:51,900 --> 01:28:54,160
...more than deserves...

1219
01:28:54,340 --> 01:28:55,460
...these.

1220
01:29:04,950 --> 01:29:06,240
Are these?

1221
01:29:06,410 --> 01:29:08,580
It's your wings, Tracy.

1222
01:29:08,750 --> 01:29:09,910
Wear them with pride...

1223
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:12,780
...every time you collect a new tooth.

1224
01:29:13,790 --> 01:29:15,880
-You're a tooth fairy, buddy.
-I got my wings.

1225
01:29:16,060 --> 01:29:17,520
You got your wings.

1226
01:29:18,390 --> 01:29:19,860
Here. You need this.

1227
01:29:20,030 --> 01:29:22,930
Little bag. I don't know why
I'm speaking like this.

1228
01:29:27,270 --> 01:29:28,740
No?

1229
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:32,140
Thank you, milady.

1230
01:29:32,870 --> 01:29:36,600
This is great and I'm proud of you.
You're the tallest tooth fairy in the world.

1231
01:29:36,780 --> 01:29:39,300
But I gotta go.
Somebody's gotta poof me down.

1232
01:29:39,480 --> 01:29:43,780
Tracy, would you like to do the honors
or shall I?

1233
01:29:44,390 --> 01:29:48,520
-Oh, so honors? Oh, a gift. Yeah.
-I'm afraid not.

1234
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:53,390
You're not gonna remember anything
that happened in Fairyland.

1235
01:29:53,560 --> 01:29:57,500
-Why?
-Because that's just the way we do it.

1236
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:02,970
I'll never forget you.

1237
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:08,810
I can't believe you showed up at the rink.

1238
01:30:10,850 --> 01:30:12,470
It's just the way we do things.

1239
01:30:15,820 --> 01:30:19,050
Thank you, Tracy, for everything.

1240
01:30:22,260 --> 01:30:24,750
You big four-eyed giraffe.

1241
01:30:24,930 --> 01:30:27,190
Go back to the zoo.

1242
01:30:28,330 --> 01:30:30,320
And you get that head back
to Easter Island.

1243
01:30:33,100 --> 01:30:35,400
Hammer brothers are still in town.

1244
01:30:35,570 --> 01:30:37,160
Let me meet those guys.

1245
01:30:40,710 --> 01:30:43,070
-You're my man.
-And you are my fairy.

1246
01:30:43,240 --> 01:30:46,680
-Could we e-mail or something?
-We should be able to e-mail each other.

1247
01:30:46,850 --> 01:30:50,210
-Do you blog? I'd love to read your blog.
-I do blog. Wanna read my blog?

1248
01:30:50,380 --> 01:30:53,580
-Do you Facebook? I could poke you.
-I'd love to be poked!

1249
01:30:53,750 --> 01:30:54,850
Yes.

1250
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:12,460
-Oh, there you are. I couldn't find you.
-Hi.

1251
01:31:12,640 --> 01:31:15,770
Yeah, I was just at... I was...

1252
01:31:17,780 --> 01:31:21,440
-I am so excited.
-Me too.

1253
01:31:22,450 --> 01:31:25,320
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

1254
01:31:25,950 --> 01:31:27,780
-Hi, honey.
-Hi, Derek.

1255
01:31:34,830 --> 01:31:35,850
Good job, Timmy!

1256
01:31:36,030 --> 01:31:38,430
Keep it going
for our last performer of the night...

1257
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:41,030
...Randy Harris!

1258
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:49,240
Randy!

1259
01:32:16,670 --> 01:32:19,040
-Go, Randy!
-Yeah!

1260
01:33:39,220 --> 01:33:42,150
-Way to go, Randy!
-Great job!

1261
01:33:51,570 --> 01:33:55,020
Randy! That's my kid!

1262
01:33:57,570 --> 01:34:00,870
Hey, I was just wondering.
What if we got married?

1263
01:34:06,610 --> 01:34:08,810
What if we got married?

1264
01:34:11,250 --> 01:34:12,950
Did you hear what I said?

1265
01:34:14,820 --> 01:34:16,590
I said "what if."

1266
01:34:19,590 --> 01:34:21,290
-Yes.
-Yeah?

1267
01:34:30,370 --> 01:34:31,600
We're getting married.

1268
01:34:33,470 --> 01:34:34,570
Yeah!

1269
01:34:41,750 --> 01:34:43,940
We're getting married.

1270
01:35:02,200 --> 01:35:03,290
Good evening, everybody.

1271
01:35:03,470 --> 01:35:08,070
Welcome to Staples Center,
the home of your Los Angeles Kings.

1272
01:35:08,240 --> 01:35:11,230
Now let's introduce tonight's
starting lineup for the Kings.

1273
01:35:11,410 --> 01:35:17,010
-At right wing, number 13, John Zeiler.
-Hey, excuse me. Hey, dude! Dude!

1274
01:35:17,180 --> 01:35:21,020
Hey, big daddy. Just wanna
shake your hand. I don't want anything.

1275
01:35:21,190 --> 01:35:24,020
Excited to see you back in the NHL
right where you belong.

1276
01:35:24,190 --> 01:35:26,560
-Look at you now, huh?
-Do I know you?

1277
01:35:26,730 --> 01:35:29,720
No, I'm just excited to see you
because I believe in you, man.

1278
01:35:29,900 --> 01:35:33,530
I believe in you, big daddy.
I believe in you, Derek Thompson.

1279
01:35:33,700 --> 01:35:36,860
In goal, number 32, Jonathan Quick.

1280
01:35:38,140 --> 01:35:40,800
And starting at left wing...

1281
01:35:40,970 --> 01:35:44,970
...number 40, Derek Thompson.

1282
01:35:45,480 --> 01:35:47,740
-Yes!
-I got you a few of your favorite things.

1283
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:49,880
Oh, thank you, Jerry.

1284
01:35:50,050 --> 01:35:52,580
It's not every day
the boss asks me to go off-campus.

1285
01:35:52,750 --> 01:35:54,880
It's about time I got you
out of that basement.

1286
01:35:55,060 --> 01:35:56,450
-That's cool.
-Did you see him?

1287
01:35:56,620 --> 01:36:00,060
-Yeah, we're fine.
-Oh, I miss him.

1288
01:36:00,230 --> 01:36:03,320
Yes! Knock him on his bum.

1289
01:36:04,770 --> 01:36:06,060
It's like a whole new you.

1290
01:36:06,230 --> 01:36:09,000
I don't know why you like this.
You can't even see the ball.

1291
01:36:09,170 --> 01:36:11,900
-It's called a puck.
-Yeah, but you can't even see it.

1292
01:36:12,070 --> 01:36:14,400
I mean, something that small
moving that fast...

1293
01:36:14,580 --> 01:36:16,870
...it'd be so much better
to get closer to it.

1294
01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:18,740
You know what I mean?

1295
01:36:20,050 --> 01:36:21,170
-Jerry.
-I'm gonna do it.

1296
01:36:21,350 --> 01:36:22,680
-You're not.
-I'm gonna do it.

1297
01:36:22,850 --> 01:36:24,480
-No. No, Jerry.
-I gotta do it.

1298
01:36:24,650 --> 01:36:27,880
I gotta do this.
Okay, I'm not gonna do it.

1299
01:36:28,760 --> 01:36:30,350
I'm just kidding, I gotta do it.

1300
01:36:33,430 --> 01:36:34,890
This is gonna be cool.

1301
01:36:35,730 --> 01:36:37,390
I love my job!

1302
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:52,850
That was a rush.

1303
01:37:29,020 --> 01:37:31,110
Thank you.

1304
01:37:54,610 --> 01:37:57,300
I don't know why I'm speaking like this.

1305
01:38:24,570 --> 01:38:26,700
Kitty, be gone!

1306
01:38:31,240 --> 01:38:33,300
I hate this job.

1307
01:39:19,030 --> 01:39:21,520
Good luck finding your cars.

1308
01:39:55,800 --> 01:39:58,200
My wing. My wing.

1309
01:40:04,910 --> 01:40:07,070
Fairy coming through.

1310
01:41:22,020 --> 01:41:26,520
I got the tooth! I got the tooth, baby!
Yeah!
