1
00:00:36,451 --> 00:00:40,148
<i>Imagine an end to crime...</i>

2
00:00:40,889 --> 00:00:43,050
<i>...an end to poverty.</i>

3
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:48,794
<i>Imagine 2 million good jobs
waiting to be filled.</i>

4
00:00:49,197 --> 00:00:52,030
<i>Sounds like a dream, doesn't it?</i>

5
00:00:52,834 --> 00:00:57,237
<i>Well, sometimes dreams come true.</i>

6
00:00:57,472 --> 00:00:59,167
<i>Delta City.</i>

7
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:01,475
<i>For our children.</i>

8
00:01:08,416 --> 00:01:12,318
<i>This is Media Break. You give us
three minutes, we'll give you the world.</i>

9
00:01:12,921 --> 00:01:15,913
<i>Good evening, I'm Casey Wong.
Our top story tonight:</i>

10
00:01:16,091 --> 00:01:20,084
<i>Motor City goes Japanese as the
Omni Consumer Products Corporation...</i>

11
00:01:20,262 --> 00:01:23,857
<i>...ended months of speculation today
by announcing its takeover...</i>

12
00:01:24,065 --> 00:01:27,330
<i>...by the multinational
Kanemitsu Corporation.</i>

13
00:01:27,502 --> 00:01:31,563
Come on, honey, hurry up with your
calculus. It's almost time for bed.

14
00:01:32,507 --> 00:01:34,566
I'm watching Media Break.

15
00:01:34,876 --> 00:01:38,368
<i>- the first private corporation
to completely own and operate a major city.</i>

16
00:01:38,546 --> 00:01:40,946
<i>Company spokesmen
express special interest...</i>

17
00:01:41,082 --> 00:01:43,175
<i>...in the issues of urban resettlement...</i>

18
00:01:43,351 --> 00:01:48,448
<i>...and a crime wave in Detroit that
many citizens are calling a war zone.</i>

19
00:01:52,027 --> 00:01:54,222
<i>But as usual, OCP has an answer.</i>

20
00:01:54,963 --> 00:01:58,524
<i>Meet the Rehabs, Urban
rehabilitation officers.</i>

21
00:01:58,867 --> 00:02:01,028
<i>From the blazing fields
of the Amazon War...</i>

22
00:02:01,202 --> 00:02:04,433
<i>...comes state-of-the-art
urban pacification.</i>

23
00:02:04,773 --> 00:02:09,472
<i>We're here to help the people, augment the
police force and deal with the gang problem.</i>

24
00:02:09,811 --> 00:02:12,302
<i>What about reports you're
actually evicting people...</i>

25
00:02:12,514 --> 00:02:15,142
<i>...to make way for
construction of Delta City?</i>

26
00:02:15,517 --> 00:02:18,008
Nikko, you heard your mom.
Go on.

27
00:02:18,987 --> 00:02:20,545
Oh, man.

28
00:02:23,325 --> 00:02:25,020
<i>- And the homeless?
- What a gyp.</i>

29
00:02:25,226 --> 00:02:28,855
<i>Some buildings have to come down
before Delta can go up.</i>

30
00:02:29,264 --> 00:02:32,165
<i>I won't deny we're serving
an eviction notice or two...</i>

31
00:02:32,334 --> 00:02:37,169
<i>...but most of these people have already
taken their urine tests and placement exams.</i>

32
00:02:37,339 --> 00:02:40,035
<i>They've got new jobs waiting for them.</i>

33
00:02:40,241 --> 00:02:43,142
<i>We're just helping them
make the transition, that's all.</i>

34
00:02:43,578 --> 00:02:47,446
<i>- We're cops, nothing more.
- Nothing more?</i>

35
00:02:47,849 --> 00:02:50,340
<i>Well, we're not robots,
if that's what you mean.</i>

36
00:03:17,112 --> 00:03:18,409
Hey, Dad?

37
00:03:23,885 --> 00:03:25,580
You're supposed to be asleep.

38
00:03:26,021 --> 00:03:29,957
Is it true what the Tv said?

39
00:03:30,492 --> 00:03:32,357
That it's a war zone outside?

40
00:03:32,594 --> 00:03:36,826
Don't listen to what the Tv says.
This is your home, you hear me?

41
00:03:36,998 --> 00:03:38,829
And you're safe here.

42
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:49,135
<i>I'll buy that for a dollar!</i>

43
00:03:49,978 --> 00:03:52,572
Get out, get out, get out!

44
00:04:00,155 --> 00:04:03,454
This neighborhood is the
property of omni Consumer Products.

45
00:04:30,452 --> 00:04:34,388
- For God's sake, help us!
- That's what we're here for, ma'am.

46
00:04:38,193 --> 00:04:40,252
Just get on the bus.

47
00:04:40,862 --> 00:04:44,059
Where are they taking us, Dad?
What's happening?

48
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:50,301
Don't believe them! They'll throw us
into the streets to die like rats!

49
00:04:50,472 --> 00:04:53,202
Nazi sons of bitches!

50
00:04:58,113 --> 00:05:00,343
Shoot her if you must,
but get her out of here.

51
00:05:00,515 --> 00:05:01,982
Yes, sir.

52
00:05:02,784 --> 00:05:05,184
Let's go. Come on.

53
00:05:05,386 --> 00:05:08,116
I think it's going rather well,
don't you?

54
00:05:08,323 --> 00:05:09,483
Yes, sir.

55
00:05:09,924 --> 00:05:12,552
Come on, I said, move! Move!

56
00:05:12,894 --> 00:05:16,352
- Manandle an old lady, would you?
- Shut up!

57
00:05:18,867 --> 00:05:20,562
- Move, move!
- Get up there!

58
00:05:20,969 --> 00:05:22,869
I said, get up!

59
00:05:23,938 --> 00:05:27,772
What are you doing down there?
Piece of slime!

60
00:05:28,376 --> 00:05:29,968
Can you hear me?

61
00:05:31,246 --> 00:05:33,806
I said, get up, you drunken cow!

62
00:05:37,018 --> 00:05:39,953
Get back! The crane's gonna blow!

63
00:05:51,466 --> 00:05:54,765
Listen to me, people!
These buses are going nowhere!

64
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:59,969
Stay here! Fight for your homes!
There is no silver lining!

65
00:06:00,141 --> 00:06:04,908
Only corporate scumbags
who want to line their pockets!

66
00:06:11,953 --> 00:06:14,114
Nikko! Nikko!

67
00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:18,191
Mom! Mom! Dad!

68
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,998
Nikko! No! That's my baby!
Nikko, Nikko!

69
00:06:26,034 --> 00:06:29,800
Mom! Dad! Dad!

70
00:06:30,038 --> 00:06:31,801
Mom, Dad!

71
00:06:36,311 --> 00:06:38,176
Mom!

72
00:06:50,124 --> 00:06:52,058
Mom!

73
00:06:52,994 --> 00:06:54,393
Dad?!

74
00:06:56,898 --> 00:06:58,798
Mom!

75
00:07:10,445 --> 00:07:13,005
You! Stay where you are!

76
00:07:35,236 --> 00:07:39,866
<i>Repeat: The rehabilitation
officers are here to assist you.</i>

77
00:07:47,815 --> 00:07:51,478
It's okay, it's okay.
You're with us now.

78
00:07:52,387 --> 00:07:53,376
Is he gone?

79
00:07:54,389 --> 00:07:56,118
Are we clear?

80
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:57,349
Clear!

81
00:07:58,426 --> 00:08:00,417
Okay, let's do it.

82
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,229
Okay, Moreno.

83
00:08:13,408 --> 00:08:14,397
<i>Cover your ears.</i>

84
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:19,478
Rock 'r roll.

85
00:08:31,059 --> 00:08:33,027
<i>All clear. Let's go.</i>

86
00:08:47,442 --> 00:08:49,000
Jesus!

87
00:08:51,112 --> 00:08:53,580
- ED 209!
- He wasrt in the recon photo!

88
00:08:56,584 --> 00:09:00,247
Freeze! You are trespassing
on police property.

89
00:09:00,421 --> 00:09:02,013
Please surrender your weapons.

90
00:09:02,223 --> 00:09:04,054
- What the hell?
- Is she crazy?

91
00:09:04,225 --> 00:09:06,090
You have 20 seconds to comply.

92
00:09:06,294 --> 00:09:09,957
- Hey, kid, come back here!
- You're gonna get us all killed!

93
00:09:11,099 --> 00:09:13,090
What the hell is she doing?

94
00:09:13,267 --> 00:09:17,363
You are in direct violation
of penal code 114, section 3.

95
00:09:17,538 --> 00:09:20,837
I am authorized to use physical force.

96
00:09:21,042 --> 00:09:24,011
You now have 10 seconds to comply.

97
00:09:25,079 --> 00:09:28,446
You won't believe this.
He'll be loyal as a puppy.

98
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:31,944
You have five seconds.
Four seconds.

99
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,786
Three seconds.
You have one second to comply.

100
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:39,358
I am now authorized to...

101
00:09:40,361 --> 00:09:42,886
...be loyal as a puppy.

102
00:09:43,331 --> 00:09:44,457
Damn!

103
00:09:53,141 --> 00:09:54,130
Will it work?

104
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:57,310
Stole it off a dead cop.

105
00:10:04,819 --> 00:10:06,946
Holy shit! That's the police armory!

106
00:10:10,158 --> 00:10:13,423
- They deleted the access signature.
- Let's get out of here!

107
00:10:13,928 --> 00:10:17,227
They'll be a few minutes. Let's
figure out how to open that door!

108
00:10:17,398 --> 00:10:18,558
Are you kidding me?

109
00:11:00,942 --> 00:11:02,773
One-stop shopping.

110
00:11:09,283 --> 00:11:12,081
- Let's go! Gotta get out of here!
- He's right. Let's ride.

111
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:18,916
- What are you, picking out drapes?
- Coming!

112
00:11:24,298 --> 00:11:25,890
- Get that.
- Why?

113
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,159
It looks expensive.

114
00:11:34,542 --> 00:11:36,476
Come on! Come on, let's go!

115
00:11:42,517 --> 00:11:43,882
Drop your weapons now!

116
00:11:44,285 --> 00:11:45,980
Do it! Drop them!

117
00:11:52,426 --> 00:11:55,554
Freeze! You're trespassing
on police property.

118
00:11:57,064 --> 00:11:58,827
Eat lead, suckers!

119
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:11,141
Nikko, get in! Come on!

120
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:50,847
What can I do for you?

121
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,851
Nobody move!

122
00:12:55,022 --> 00:12:57,286
Everything in the register!
Now! Do it!

123
00:13:06,167 --> 00:13:09,000
What's it like
being a rocket scientist?

124
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:13,800
<i>All units, we have a B and E involving
police property, please respond.</i>

125
00:13:13,975 --> 00:13:16,307
<i>Repeat, all units, we have a...</i>

126
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:19,377
Hey, Donnelly, it's your turn.

127
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:23,414
- No way. We went last time.
- No, it's Lewis' turn.

128
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,344
Lewis, you're up.

129
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:32,150
Lewis! Lewis! Lewis!

130
00:13:33,861 --> 00:13:36,853
Isn't anybody gonna arrest me,
or what?!

131
00:13:37,231 --> 00:13:40,291
- Where's your friend Murphy?
- He's not big on doughnuts.

132
00:13:40,468 --> 00:13:42,527
- He's not big on doughnuts.
- I knew that.

133
00:13:42,937 --> 00:13:46,429
<i>All units, repeat,
that is a battered yellow van.</i>

134
00:13:46,807 --> 00:13:49,207
<i>No plates.
Tracking shows southbound...</i>

135
00:13:50,077 --> 00:13:53,274
- That's a battered yellow van.
- No shit, Sherlock.

136
00:14:04,392 --> 00:14:06,326
Moreno, company's coming!

137
00:14:10,264 --> 00:14:11,788
Hold on. Here we go.

138
00:14:18,372 --> 00:14:22,172
Unit 477 in pursuit,
eastbound, Esposito.

139
00:14:31,452 --> 00:14:32,476
Watch it!

140
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,185
I'm watching it!

141
00:14:57,111 --> 00:14:58,100
Jesus!

142
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,427
They're still on our tail.

143
00:15:14,929 --> 00:15:16,453
Don't sweat it.

144
00:15:16,797 --> 00:15:18,765
Hey, kid. Watch this.

145
00:16:00,107 --> 00:16:01,972
Hold the champagne.

146
00:16:12,386 --> 00:16:14,377
You stopped in the middle
of the street!

147
00:16:14,555 --> 00:16:17,183
- That was my light!
- You idiot!

148
00:16:17,358 --> 00:16:20,384
- Is everybody okay?
- Okay? What are you, a comedian?

149
00:16:20,594 --> 00:16:23,961
I traded in a brand new SUX
for this classic. Now look at it!

150
00:16:24,131 --> 00:16:26,565
It's garbage. It's going to the junkyard.

151
00:16:26,934 --> 00:16:31,962
What is this, fellas? You give a broad
a badge and she gets delusions of gander.

152
00:16:32,139 --> 00:16:34,869
It's "grandeur," dumbshit.

153
00:16:38,445 --> 00:16:41,141
This new guy is making me nervous.

154
00:16:42,049 --> 00:16:44,313
I don't think this is exactly a guy.

155
00:16:44,485 --> 00:16:46,146
You think it's him?

156
00:16:52,059 --> 00:16:53,822
Unit 477 to dispatch.

157
00:16:53,994 --> 00:16:57,225
This is 477 to dispatch.
Come in, dispatch.

158
00:16:57,398 --> 00:16:59,298
We could use some backup out here.

159
00:16:59,466 --> 00:17:03,334
Hello, dispatch. Come in.
This is 477 to dispatch.

160
00:17:04,205 --> 00:17:05,297
Lewis.

161
00:17:11,145 --> 00:17:12,544
Splatterpunks.

162
00:17:15,015 --> 00:17:18,246
Wait a second, what do you need
the shotgun for?

163
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:20,353
Shit, we're all gonna die.

164
00:17:20,554 --> 00:17:23,250
- Sit tight, people. Backup's coming.
- Sit tight?

165
00:17:23,424 --> 00:17:27,952
If it wasrt for you, I wouldn't
even be here, you dumb broad.

166
00:17:28,128 --> 00:17:32,292
I'll make you a deal, tough guy.
You want to eat the tie, keep it up.

167
00:17:32,499 --> 00:17:35,059
Take it easy. My brother's a cop.

168
00:18:17,811 --> 00:18:22,544
<i>477 to dispatch, code 3! We're low
on ammo and need immediate backup!</i>

169
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:23,839
<i>Right now!</i>

170
00:18:33,594 --> 00:18:34,925
Sergeant Reed.

171
00:18:35,429 --> 00:18:37,363
I got Murphy's cruiser on the grid.

172
00:18:37,564 --> 00:18:39,964
- He just turned around.
- He what?!

173
00:19:03,457 --> 00:19:05,425
Murphy, this is Reed.

174
00:19:05,592 --> 00:19:08,493
I have three other vehicles
en route to Lewis.

175
00:19:09,129 --> 00:19:14,192
Murphy, continue pursuit! That is a
direct order! Do I make myself clear?

176
00:19:14,368 --> 00:19:15,960
<i>Murphy, are you listen...?</i>

177
00:20:25,272 --> 00:20:28,036
Police officer. No loitering.

178
00:20:44,425 --> 00:20:45,824
You called for backup?

179
00:20:51,165 --> 00:20:53,497
Thanks for dropping by, Murphy.

180
00:20:54,334 --> 00:20:56,063
Are they gone?

181
00:20:56,837 --> 00:20:58,896
I'm still scanning three.

182
00:21:07,114 --> 00:21:09,173
Make that two.

183
00:21:15,456 --> 00:21:17,856
Block it! Megazone invasion!

184
00:21:18,025 --> 00:21:21,324
Pop a tranq, hypo-head.
Splatterville's ours.

185
00:21:22,062 --> 00:21:23,927
Shoot him in the mouth.

186
00:21:24,164 --> 00:21:25,995
Cyborg eats bullets, Jock.

187
00:21:26,767 --> 00:21:28,064
Not tonight he don't.

188
00:22:19,486 --> 00:22:20,851
Hit him in the mouth!

189
00:22:21,054 --> 00:22:22,954
- Shut up!
- Do it! Do it!

190
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:25,081
- Do it! Do it!
- Shut up!

191
00:22:29,997 --> 00:22:31,760
Nice try, creeps.

192
00:22:31,932 --> 00:22:32,921
Give me it!

193
00:22:34,368 --> 00:22:36,802
You have the right to remain silent.

194
00:22:46,146 --> 00:22:47,579
Down there.

195
00:22:53,787 --> 00:22:55,516
Jesus, Murphy, are you okay?

196
00:22:55,856 --> 00:22:57,551
I'm fine, Anne.

197
00:22:57,891 --> 00:22:59,324
Thank you for asking.

198
00:23:01,361 --> 00:23:02,953
Come on, come on!

199
00:23:18,478 --> 00:23:21,447
Let's go! Everything
will be all right.

200
00:23:24,785 --> 00:23:26,275
Get your damn hands off me!

201
00:23:31,491 --> 00:23:32,890
Stupid kid.

202
00:23:43,103 --> 00:23:46,334
- Come here. Come on.
- Would you forget the stupid kid already?!

203
00:24:27,347 --> 00:24:29,247
Kanemitsu-san...

204
00:24:29,416 --> 00:24:32,044
...I realize we've had setbacks...

205
00:24:32,219 --> 00:24:37,179
...but we've done everything possible
to get Delta City back on schedule.

206
00:24:50,937 --> 00:24:52,063
Gentlemen...

207
00:24:54,374 --> 00:24:57,309
...you are now looking at a company...

208
00:24:57,477 --> 00:24:58,967
...in transition.

209
00:24:59,846 --> 00:25:04,249
Needless to say, this has resulted in
the implementation of certain...

210
00:25:04,418 --> 00:25:05,851
...well...

211
00:25:06,019 --> 00:25:07,486
...let's call them...

212
00:25:08,221 --> 00:25:09,950
..."cutbacks."

213
00:25:10,123 --> 00:25:13,183
But who can put a price tag
on a dream?

214
00:25:14,961 --> 00:25:18,089
Our esteemed former chairman
had a dream.

215
00:25:18,265 --> 00:25:20,028
He called it Delta City.

216
00:25:21,101 --> 00:25:22,568
Knock it off, Johnson.

217
00:25:26,206 --> 00:25:30,575
The great city of Detroit represents
an important precedent, gentlemen.

218
00:25:31,144 --> 00:25:33,772
There's only one small problem.

219
00:25:34,214 --> 00:25:36,478
It's turning into a war zone!

220
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:38,477
It's just a small resistance group.

221
00:25:38,819 --> 00:25:41,811
There's no reason to believe they
pose a significant threat.

222
00:25:42,055 --> 00:25:43,522
I'd consider...

223
00:25:43,857 --> 00:25:48,055
...a deficit of 350 million dollars
a significant threat.

224
00:25:48,261 --> 00:25:49,785
Wouldrt you?

225
00:25:51,465 --> 00:25:53,228
- Fleck!
- Sir.

226
00:25:53,367 --> 00:25:55,494
You're in charge of Security Concepts.

227
00:25:55,802 --> 00:25:58,828
Where's that Robocop
we spent so much money on?

228
00:25:59,005 --> 00:26:02,941
The police had a problem
with the unit. I'm dealing with it personally.

229
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:04,509
You do that.

230
00:26:05,112 --> 00:26:06,773
Get him to the Rehab Team...

231
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:11,440
...and maybe we won't have to worry
about a "small resistance group."

232
00:26:11,785 --> 00:26:14,015
Get the hell out of here, all of you!

233
00:26:14,187 --> 00:26:15,449
You take your time.

234
00:26:15,789 --> 00:26:17,950
And for God's sake, Fleck...

235
00:26:18,125 --> 00:26:21,026
...try to get the police on our side.

236
00:26:26,133 --> 00:26:29,125
What if I don't want
a robot on my team?

237
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:33,198
You've got 4 days, McDaggett.

238
00:26:33,774 --> 00:26:37,266
If Cadillac Heights isn't cleared
for demolition Friday midnight...

239
00:26:37,477 --> 00:26:41,470
...our loans will be called in.
OCP will be ruined.

240
00:26:41,848 --> 00:26:43,577
We made a deal, didn't we, chum.

241
00:26:44,584 --> 00:26:46,882
Oh, by the way...

242
00:26:47,888 --> 00:26:52,552
...if you're just figuring out the
line between big business and war...

243
00:26:52,893 --> 00:26:55,054
...is a little blurry...

244
00:26:55,262 --> 00:26:58,026
...then you're further over the hill
than they say.

245
00:27:51,051 --> 00:27:54,851
This is entrapment! My client was
visiting close friends in that motel.

246
00:27:55,021 --> 00:27:58,115
Hey, buddy. Your client's friends...

247
00:27:58,291 --> 00:28:01,351
...were a non-union video crew
and a German shepherd.

248
00:28:01,561 --> 00:28:02,960
That's prejudicial.

249
00:28:03,129 --> 00:28:06,895
Did the arresting officer
ask to see their union cards?

250
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:10,467
Come get this crap.
Will someone answer the damn phone?!

251
00:28:10,837 --> 00:28:14,796
Metro West. No, ma'am,
we're not on strike.

252
00:28:14,975 --> 00:28:18,433
You could have fooled me.
I'll deal with those looters myself.

253
00:28:18,778 --> 00:28:21,474
Get me a baseball bat
with some nails in it.

254
00:28:30,223 --> 00:28:31,850
How are you feeling?

255
00:28:33,393 --> 00:28:35,020
I've been better.

256
00:28:35,996 --> 00:28:40,126
To be honest, it looks like you just
made friends with a Mack truck.

257
00:28:42,102 --> 00:28:43,831
I don't have many...

258
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:45,028
...friends.

259
00:28:56,216 --> 00:28:57,205
Dr. Lazarus.

260
00:28:59,185 --> 00:29:04,145
- You want to tell me what happened?
- Atlanta beat the Pistons last night.

261
00:29:04,324 --> 00:29:08,317
- That's cute. I meant with glory boy.
- Oh, him.

262
00:29:09,062 --> 00:29:11,963
He got shot to hell and set on fire.

263
00:29:12,132 --> 00:29:15,761
You know what I'm talking about.
He disobeyed a direct order. Why?

264
00:29:15,936 --> 00:29:19,497
- My real opinion?
- No, lie. Make up a story.

265
00:29:20,774 --> 00:29:22,401
Well, Mr. Fleck...

266
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:25,307
...offhand...

267
00:29:25,478 --> 00:29:29,414
...l'd say the only reason
he'd disobey an order is if...

268
00:29:29,583 --> 00:29:31,414
...he didn't agree with it.

269
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:34,809
Excuse me?

270
00:29:36,122 --> 00:29:38,022
He made a decision.

271
00:29:38,325 --> 00:29:42,261
His friend was in trouble, he made
a judgment call. Cops do that.

272
00:29:42,429 --> 00:29:45,489
Human cops. What do you mean,
"his friend"? It's a machine.

273
00:29:45,799 --> 00:29:50,065
Look, if oCP just wanted a robot, why'd
they put Murphy in there in the first place?

274
00:29:50,203 --> 00:29:52,501
Murphy's dead, sweetheart,
that's on record.

275
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:55,307
Mr. Fleck, this is Murphy!

276
00:29:55,475 --> 00:29:58,171
What's left of his face,
his cerebrum, his cerebellum.

277
00:29:58,345 --> 00:30:00,575
Human tissue that's still alive.

278
00:30:00,914 --> 00:30:02,973
How can you interface human
and machine...

279
00:30:03,149 --> 00:30:05,845
...then complain
when the human part makes a decision?

280
00:30:08,989 --> 00:30:12,481
So not only did we get Murphy's
years of training...

281
00:30:12,792 --> 00:30:16,319
...and his law-enforcement skills,
we also inerited...

282
00:30:16,496 --> 00:30:20,398
...his memories, his feelings,
his emotional baggage?

283
00:30:20,767 --> 00:30:26,000
Well, I'd call it his humanity,
but I don't think you know that word.

284
00:30:27,007 --> 00:30:28,167
I see.

285
00:30:29,976 --> 00:30:33,070
You talked me into it.
His emotions: Get rid of them.

286
00:30:34,347 --> 00:30:38,477
Find their location and erase them.
If it wipes out his memory, too bad.

287
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:44,083
We could cut out
the appropriate circuits by...

288
00:30:45,058 --> 00:30:48,391
...implanting a micro-neuro-barrier.

289
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,858
Do it.

290
00:30:57,137 --> 00:31:00,106
I got news for you.
I don't give a shit how smart you are.

291
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,267
OCP owns the cops. That means they
own him, and they own your cute little ass.

292
00:31:04,944 --> 00:31:06,809
Nobody owns me.

293
00:31:07,414 --> 00:31:08,779
Fine.

294
00:31:09,015 --> 00:31:12,781
We want him on the Rehab Team.

295
00:31:13,053 --> 00:31:16,955
That means you make him predictable,
or look for a new job, sweet cheeks.

296
00:31:23,863 --> 00:31:25,455
I think I'm in love.

297
00:31:40,947 --> 00:31:43,211
What's going through your head?

298
00:32:00,533 --> 00:32:01,932
That's his family.

299
00:32:02,769 --> 00:32:05,397
Want me to install
the neuro-barrier, doctor?

300
00:32:05,772 --> 00:32:07,569
No, I can do it.

301
00:32:14,881 --> 00:32:17,782
I think I'd like to be alone with him,
if it's all right.

302
00:32:46,579 --> 00:32:49,571
<i>Alex, I thought
you'd never get home.</i>

303
00:32:55,054 --> 00:32:59,286
Don't let the fact that these people
are homeless sway you.

304
00:33:00,927 --> 00:33:03,521
They're terrorists, pure and simple.

305
00:33:04,864 --> 00:33:08,891
On the screens
are suspected rebel locations.

306
00:33:09,102 --> 00:33:13,095
If these locations appear
on your regular beat, check it out.

307
00:33:13,273 --> 00:33:17,334
Make sure you report
any unusual findings...

308
00:33:19,479 --> 00:33:21,106
Hear what they did to Murphy?

309
00:34:07,093 --> 00:34:08,355
Murphy.

310
00:34:31,451 --> 00:34:33,510
Lewis, you want your body armor?

311
00:34:33,887 --> 00:34:36,515
What? No, I'm off duty.

312
00:34:39,492 --> 00:34:41,221
What's up, anyway?

313
00:34:42,028 --> 00:34:43,188
Do you have family?

314
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:48,262
Yeah, I have a brother in Pittsburgh,
the one who never calls. You know that.

315
00:34:50,036 --> 00:34:51,799
Robo, are you okay?

316
00:34:52,105 --> 00:34:53,538
I'm fine.

317
00:34:55,141 --> 00:34:56,802
And call me Murphy.

318
00:36:02,475 --> 00:36:03,965
Murphy?

319
00:36:09,482 --> 00:36:11,416
<i>Step out of the building.</i>

320
00:36:33,072 --> 00:36:35,165
Stay right there.

321
00:36:35,575 --> 00:36:37,475
We're police officers.

322
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:38,936
We don't want you.

323
00:36:39,145 --> 00:36:42,876
We believe there are squatters in there.
Now step away from the door.

324
00:36:43,049 --> 00:36:46,143
They're civilians.
They're just trying to stay warm!

325
00:36:46,352 --> 00:36:49,412
Those people belong
in the nearest rehabilitation center.

326
00:36:52,825 --> 00:36:57,558
Some are terrorists. Step away or you
will be cited for obstructing justice.

327
00:37:02,769 --> 00:37:04,999
I'm not going to ask politely next time.

328
00:37:05,171 --> 00:37:06,570
Step away from the door.

329
00:37:10,109 --> 00:37:12,441
This is your final warning.

330
00:37:25,792 --> 00:37:28,192
You are making a mistake.

331
00:37:31,864 --> 00:37:35,891
- Back off, or there'll be trouble.
- Now you're talking, Murphy.

332
00:37:36,102 --> 00:37:39,936
We're not budging. If you wanna get in,
you'll have to shoot through us.

333
00:37:41,441 --> 00:37:44,239
I don't have a huge problem with that.

334
00:38:12,105 --> 00:38:13,197
Cease fire!

335
00:38:27,887 --> 00:38:29,184
Robocop.

336
00:38:35,094 --> 00:38:37,153
Come on, come on, come on!

337
00:38:42,835 --> 00:38:43,961
Come with us!

338
00:38:45,571 --> 00:38:46,868
Cover me.

339
00:39:26,045 --> 00:39:29,446
Some tough cop I am. Huh, partner?

340
00:39:34,921 --> 00:39:37,185
I'm scared.

341
00:39:38,524 --> 00:39:40,082
Don't be.

342
00:39:40,259 --> 00:39:42,250
It won't hurt long.

343
00:39:44,564 --> 00:39:46,429
Get them for me.

344
00:39:47,433 --> 00:39:48,991
Promise me.

345
00:39:49,168 --> 00:39:51,466
I promise.

346
00:39:54,473 --> 00:39:56,065
Murphy.

347
00:40:05,952 --> 00:40:07,783
Officer down.

348
00:40:17,763 --> 00:40:18,957
Move it!

349
00:40:19,098 --> 00:40:21,532
We don't have much time.

350
00:40:22,235 --> 00:40:23,293
Nikko, let's go.

351
00:40:23,469 --> 00:40:25,937
Come on. Come with us.

352
00:40:26,405 --> 00:40:28,771
Is she crazy?
He's a cop! He's one of them!

353
00:40:30,042 --> 00:40:31,873
He's on our side now.

354
00:40:32,044 --> 00:40:34,103
She's right. You saw what he did.

355
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,771
You'll let a stupid kid
make our decisions?

356
00:40:36,949 --> 00:40:40,441
- We're at war. We can use his help.
- Are you kidding me? Look at him!

357
00:40:40,786 --> 00:40:42,276
He is totaled, man!

358
00:40:42,455 --> 00:40:45,015
People, come on.
We don't have time for this shit.

359
00:40:48,294 --> 00:40:49,261
He's right.

360
00:40:50,963 --> 00:40:52,089
We should go.

361
00:41:08,214 --> 00:41:11,012
Five-meter spread.
Search the perimeter.

362
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:14,577
Damn.

363
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:19,220
- We're tracking him, sir. He's moving.
- Impossible. The building is surrounded.

364
00:41:19,959 --> 00:41:21,927
He's gone underground.

365
00:41:22,094 --> 00:41:23,527
Find a manole.

366
00:41:47,553 --> 00:41:49,521
We got a little held up.

367
00:42:00,399 --> 00:42:02,026
Rats?

368
00:42:04,837 --> 00:42:05,826
One or two.

369
00:42:11,777 --> 00:42:12,573
Go on through.

370
00:42:23,089 --> 00:42:24,317
Are you okay?

371
00:42:28,361 --> 00:42:30,329
I'm fine.

372
00:42:32,064 --> 00:42:33,190
Hey!

373
00:42:34,266 --> 00:42:35,961
You guys!

374
00:42:40,239 --> 00:42:41,900
Oh, man!

375
00:42:42,141 --> 00:42:44,268
I told you it was a mistake to bring him.

376
00:42:44,477 --> 00:42:46,069
I bet he weighs a ton.

377
00:42:49,081 --> 00:42:51,015
Watch your step.

378
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:52,208
All right.

379
00:42:53,486 --> 00:42:55,147
Clear the way.

380
00:42:55,321 --> 00:42:57,585
- Get out of the way.
- Hold up your side.

381
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:05,219
He don't look good.

382
00:43:05,398 --> 00:43:09,357
You wouldn't look so good either
if you took a grenade in your chest.

383
00:43:09,835 --> 00:43:11,302
Tracking.

384
00:43:12,071 --> 00:43:13,504
- Beacon.
- Tracking?

385
00:43:15,374 --> 00:43:17,103
He'll lead them right to us!

386
00:43:17,309 --> 00:43:19,072
Shut up, Coontz!

387
00:43:19,245 --> 00:43:20,473
What's he talking about?

388
00:43:35,961 --> 00:43:39,328
- Did he booby-trap the 8th Street entrance?
- Maybe.

389
00:44:08,594 --> 00:44:10,994
Better get mobilized, folks.

390
00:44:11,497 --> 00:44:14,523
They got a little too close
to home that time.

391
00:44:15,968 --> 00:44:17,492
It's not won'th it.

392
00:44:17,837 --> 00:44:19,532
It's not won'th this shit!

393
00:44:21,207 --> 00:44:23,971
You better take
a real deep breath right now, Coontz.

394
00:44:24,143 --> 00:44:26,475
Because if you don't think
it's won'th it...

395
00:44:26,812 --> 00:44:30,248
...then you're nothing but excess baggage.
Do you hear me?!

396
00:44:32,284 --> 00:44:34,479
You get it together, Coontz.

397
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:38,517
Cadillac Heights may not be much,
but it's our home.

398
00:44:38,858 --> 00:44:40,519
It's all we got.

399
00:44:41,193 --> 00:44:45,493
If you don't think our homes is won'th
it, then tell me what the hell is.

400
00:44:52,505 --> 00:44:55,099
This is Bertha to Base op.
We're coming in.

401
00:44:55,307 --> 00:44:57,275
Set an extra place.

402
00:44:57,476 --> 00:44:59,535
We're bringing in a friend.

403
00:45:06,585 --> 00:45:08,849
<i>Incoming caller.</i>

404
00:45:15,094 --> 00:45:16,061
What do you want?

405
00:45:16,762 --> 00:45:18,354
<i>Nice work, dollface.</i>

406
00:45:18,531 --> 00:45:20,055
What you talking about?

407
00:45:20,232 --> 00:45:22,564
<i>You haven't heard?</i>

408
00:45:22,935 --> 00:45:25,062
<i>You might want to turn on Media Break.</i>

409
00:45:26,305 --> 00:45:28,773
Tv on, channel 378.

410
00:45:28,941 --> 00:45:32,900
<i>Witness to the tragic shooting
was Rehab Commander, Paul McDaggett.</i>

411
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:39,375
<i>All I can say is it's a terrible loss
of a fine public servant.</i>

412
00:45:39,985 --> 00:45:43,887
<i>It's hard to believe that she was
gunned down by her own partner.</i>

413
00:45:44,924 --> 00:45:46,892
<i>An OCP spokesperson has confirmed...</i>

414
00:45:47,026 --> 00:45:50,154
<i>...that Robocop has joined
the terrorist rebel forces.</i>

415
00:45:50,329 --> 00:45:54,322
<i>He is heavily armed and should be
considered extremely dangerous.</i>

416
00:45:54,934 --> 00:45:56,265
Tv off.

417
00:45:56,435 --> 00:46:00,565
<i>Congratulations, sweet cheeks.
Now listen up. I want your legendary ass...</i>

418
00:46:00,906 --> 00:46:03,306
<i>...and your corporate I.D. Card
in my office...</i>

419
00:46:03,442 --> 00:46:07,469
<i>...by 7:00 a.m. Tomorrow. And maybe
you won't be brought up on charges.</i>

420
00:46:07,813 --> 00:46:11,078
<i>Meantime, you might want to decide
whose side you're on.</i>

421
00:46:12,551 --> 00:46:14,348
<i>Sleep tight.</i>

422
00:46:23,362 --> 00:46:26,991
- He what?
- Shot at Rehabs and went underground.

423
00:46:27,166 --> 00:46:31,227
- There goes our P.R. Budget.
- Company line is he's gone renegade.

424
00:46:31,437 --> 00:46:33,905
- How'd the CEo take it?
- How do you think?

425
00:46:34,073 --> 00:46:37,270
Between me and you,
I think the CEo's losing it.

426
00:46:37,443 --> 00:46:39,809
I mean, take a look around, will you?

427
00:46:39,979 --> 00:46:42,004
It's the Fall of Rome around here.

428
00:46:42,181 --> 00:46:44,877
It's Darwin time,
you know what I'm saying?

429
00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:47,177
Survival of the least expendable.

430
00:46:47,353 --> 00:46:51,312
Remember the old man.
Everyone's expendable.

431
00:46:52,891 --> 00:46:55,860
<i>It can't be that bad.</i>

432
00:46:56,061 --> 00:46:58,029
<i>Honey, can you hear me?</i>

433
00:46:58,831 --> 00:47:00,230
<i>Are you there?</i>

434
00:47:01,967 --> 00:47:05,903
<i>Every corporation
goes through this sort of thing.</i>

435
00:47:26,091 --> 00:47:28,389
Oh, my God, what happened?

436
00:47:30,529 --> 00:47:31,496
What's happening?

437
00:47:31,864 --> 00:47:33,456
Arnott just went out the window.

438
00:47:33,799 --> 00:47:36,529
- That's the fourth one this month.
- Chickenshit.

439
00:47:36,902 --> 00:47:39,370
I'd eat a bullet myself.

440
00:47:39,538 --> 00:47:41,096
Less showy.

441
00:47:43,942 --> 00:47:46,809
The writing was on the wall
the minute we hopped...

442
00:47:46,979 --> 00:47:50,210
...in the sack with that shitty
Kanemitsu corporation.

443
00:47:55,788 --> 00:47:57,016
As I was saying...

444
00:47:58,991 --> 00:48:01,960
...we have a warrant out
for Robocop's arrest.

445
00:48:02,127 --> 00:48:06,791
If we can eliminate him, then we'll
find that the squatters are more...

446
00:48:06,965 --> 00:48:09,798
...let's say, easily persuaded.

447
00:48:22,815 --> 00:48:25,784
Fleck. A word with you, son.

448
00:48:25,951 --> 00:48:28,442
I'm sorry for the intrusion, sir.

449
00:48:28,787 --> 00:48:30,880
Anything Security Concepts can do?

450
00:48:31,390 --> 00:48:35,884
Security Concepts can kiss
my freckled butt. You're fired.

451
00:48:37,062 --> 00:48:40,554
You heard me!
You're fired. Get out of here.

452
00:48:49,475 --> 00:48:51,443
Three days until disaster.

453
00:48:51,810 --> 00:48:54,472
What the hell
will I tell my shareholders?

454
00:48:55,514 --> 00:48:57,311
What about more Rehabs, sir?

455
00:48:57,516 --> 00:49:01,043
We could recruit them
out of the Police Department.

456
00:49:01,987 --> 00:49:04,080
It would be cheaper than mercenaries...

457
00:49:04,223 --> 00:49:07,852
...and we could use the Metro West facility
as a staging area.

458
00:49:09,294 --> 00:49:11,888
Give them a nominal raise
for an incentive.

459
00:49:12,064 --> 00:49:14,089
You're a good man, Johnson.

460
00:49:14,266 --> 00:49:17,099
I knew there was a reason
I made you a vice president.

461
00:49:17,269 --> 00:49:18,327
Thank you, sir.

462
00:49:18,504 --> 00:49:20,472
I really...

463
00:50:02,948 --> 00:50:04,916
Heads up!

464
00:50:06,852 --> 00:50:09,082
Come on, let's go. We're gonna be late!

465
00:51:01,006 --> 00:51:02,030
Well?

466
00:51:02,207 --> 00:51:03,435
Can you fix him?

467
00:51:05,377 --> 00:51:07,868
This isn't a valve job on a Chevy.

468
00:51:09,081 --> 00:51:11,879
I never worked
on a damn Robocop before.

469
00:51:12,050 --> 00:51:14,575
- I can do the body work, but...
- Look...

470
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:17,912
...we gotta hang on to the Heights
for three more days.

471
00:51:19,024 --> 00:51:22,516
- He can hold out till then, can't he?
- Are you listening to me?!

472
00:51:24,363 --> 00:51:27,093
He's messed up.
We don't have the equipment.

473
00:51:27,266 --> 00:51:28,893
Who the hell does?!

474
00:51:30,469 --> 00:51:31,527
Lazarus.

475
00:51:36,108 --> 00:51:39,100
Find doctor...

476
00:51:40,545 --> 00:51:41,773
...Lazarus.

477
00:52:16,248 --> 00:52:18,011
Who are you?

478
00:52:18,183 --> 00:52:20,208
I'm friends with Robocop.

479
00:52:23,922 --> 00:52:26,015
Well, he's not here. I'm sorry.

480
00:52:26,358 --> 00:52:27,791
You don't believe me.

481
00:52:34,299 --> 00:52:37,166
To tell you the truth,
I don't know what to believe anymore.

482
00:52:37,436 --> 00:52:39,370
He had a message for you.

483
00:52:40,772 --> 00:52:45,232
He said to thank you for not
taking his memories away.

484
00:53:06,298 --> 00:53:08,562
Well, well, well.

485
00:53:09,935 --> 00:53:12,096
Afraid you're a little late, pal.

486
00:53:14,339 --> 00:53:17,502
You must be one of Kanemitsu's boys.

487
00:53:18,110 --> 00:53:19,475
I'm impressed.

488
00:53:20,278 --> 00:53:21,802
Trouble is...

489
00:53:25,050 --> 00:53:26,244
...your boss...

490
00:53:27,853 --> 00:53:30,117
...he kind of owns oCP.

491
00:53:30,288 --> 00:53:33,382
And oCP's kind of on our shitlist
with a bullet!

492
00:54:14,466 --> 00:54:17,560
So you want to know
where the rebels are?

493
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:21,903
You can tell your bosses
to kiss my ass!

494
00:55:01,847 --> 00:55:03,781
A vehicle is approaching.

495
00:56:00,238 --> 00:56:01,865
How you doing, Murphy?

496
00:56:02,374 --> 00:56:03,932
I've been better.

497
00:56:04,309 --> 00:56:07,107
- Give me a status scan.
- Organics intact.

498
00:56:07,846 --> 00:56:11,338
Systems efficiency: 23 percent.

499
00:56:12,851 --> 00:56:14,978
Looks like a direct hit to the heart.

500
00:56:15,353 --> 00:56:17,821
We have to recalibrate
the pneumatic system.

501
00:56:17,989 --> 00:56:19,513
Is he gonna die?

502
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:23,357
Not if I can help it.

503
00:56:24,296 --> 00:56:26,890
Let's get everything hooked up
to the generator.

504
00:56:27,399 --> 00:56:28,889
We've got work to do.

505
00:56:32,437 --> 00:56:33,927
I'm going to unplug you
for a little while.

506
00:56:35,307 --> 00:56:38,003
Don't worry,
everything's gonna be okay.

507
00:56:44,149 --> 00:56:45,275
Here you go.

508
00:56:46,885 --> 00:56:48,819
I got that heart you wanted.

509
00:56:49,454 --> 00:56:51,513
I said a Nissan. That's a Kanemitsu.

510
00:56:52,090 --> 00:56:55,184
Zack, we need that sealant! Zack!

511
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:57,351
Marie! Marie! Look!

512
00:56:57,562 --> 00:56:59,189
Oh, shit.

513
00:57:01,399 --> 00:57:03,458
Bring me that chest plate over here.

514
00:57:07,939 --> 00:57:10,100
You wait, man.

515
00:57:10,308 --> 00:57:12,799
You are gonna be so cherry.

516
00:57:13,478 --> 00:57:15,537
Moreno, watch out for the...

517
00:57:16,314 --> 00:57:18,077
What the hell are you doing?

518
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:21,083
I didn't know that thing was there!

519
00:57:21,253 --> 00:57:23,881
- Don't yell at me!
- Well, don't do it.

520
00:57:40,438 --> 00:57:41,496
Murphy.

521
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:43,302
It's you.

522
00:57:50,015 --> 00:57:52,540
Alex, I thought you'd never get home.

523
00:58:21,012 --> 00:58:22,570
Welcome home, Murphy.

524
00:58:50,975 --> 00:58:51,999
I couldn't sleep.

525
00:58:52,410 --> 00:58:53,809
How are you feeling?

526
00:58:54,212 --> 00:58:56,578
My efficiency rate is 93 percent.

527
00:58:58,516 --> 00:59:00,916
Anything above 90
is considered normal.

528
00:59:02,921 --> 00:59:04,821
I heard Marie call you Murphy.

529
00:59:05,924 --> 00:59:07,289
Is that your real name?

530
00:59:08,393 --> 00:59:09,485
It was...

531
00:59:10,395 --> 00:59:11,521
...before...

532
00:59:13,131 --> 00:59:14,291
Before what?

533
00:59:27,512 --> 00:59:29,104
So...

534
00:59:32,283 --> 00:59:35,912
Now that you're better, will you stay?

535
00:59:36,087 --> 00:59:37,384
Will you help us?

536
00:59:38,356 --> 00:59:42,816
You know what Bertha says. If we hold
back the Rehabs for two more days...

537
00:59:42,994 --> 00:59:44,825
...they can't make us move.

538
00:59:44,996 --> 00:59:49,558
And they'll have to let my parents go.
We'll all be together like family again.

539
00:59:51,936 --> 00:59:53,267
Your parents?

540
01:00:16,428 --> 01:00:18,794
Murphy? You okay?

541
01:00:19,431 --> 01:00:22,525
Your parents, you miss them?

542
01:00:25,937 --> 01:00:27,063
Yeah.

543
01:00:30,041 --> 01:00:31,030
But...

544
01:00:31,576 --> 01:00:32,975
...you remember them.

545
01:00:35,046 --> 01:00:36,104
Because...

546
01:00:37,248 --> 01:00:39,113
...if you remember them...

547
01:00:40,285 --> 01:00:41,980
...they're never really gone.

548
01:01:03,575 --> 01:01:05,065
Hey, Murphy...

549
01:01:06,444 --> 01:01:09,072
...l'm glad your new heart works.

550
01:01:15,553 --> 01:01:16,542
I heard voices.

551
01:01:22,794 --> 01:01:24,352
She should be in bed.

552
01:01:29,534 --> 01:01:31,092
Could you leave her...

553
01:01:32,170 --> 01:01:33,501
...just a moment?

554
01:01:37,942 --> 01:01:38,931
Of course.

555
01:02:05,503 --> 01:02:07,403
You gotta pay for that.

556
01:02:14,879 --> 01:02:16,437
What are you, deaf?

557
01:02:16,781 --> 01:02:17,873
Son of a...

558
01:02:38,469 --> 01:02:40,198
That's not what we said.

559
01:02:40,371 --> 01:02:43,204
It's not what we said
we were gonna do!

560
01:02:43,374 --> 01:02:45,774
Bertha, you said
to relocate the weapons...

561
01:02:45,944 --> 01:02:48,174
...but where do you want this thing?

562
01:02:50,148 --> 01:02:52,048
Oh, my God.

563
01:02:53,918 --> 01:02:55,442
How did you get this?

564
01:02:56,020 --> 01:02:58,454
We stole it from the police depot. Why?

565
01:02:58,790 --> 01:03:01,554
This looks like the exhaust
system from an F-27.

566
01:03:01,893 --> 01:03:04,259
No. It's the prototype
for Robo's flight pack.

567
01:03:04,429 --> 01:03:07,956
The funding ran out
before we got a chance to test it.

568
01:03:08,099 --> 01:03:11,296
- How do you know so much about it?
- I designed it.

569
01:03:13,938 --> 01:03:17,897
Well, looks like the odds
on the home team just went up.

570
01:03:35,426 --> 01:03:38,054
What I've done
is programmed the command system...

571
01:03:38,229 --> 01:03:40,925
...to take its cues from your hard drive.

572
01:03:41,499 --> 01:03:44,434
I've also rigged it to work as
an auxiliary power unit.

573
01:03:44,769 --> 01:03:47,761
So if you ever have a power drain
like yesterday...

574
01:03:47,939 --> 01:03:52,137
...just interface with the flight pack
and recharge whether you fly or not.

575
01:03:52,910 --> 01:03:55,037
Nikko, see those resistors over there?

576
01:03:55,213 --> 01:03:56,976
Get them for me, will you?

577
01:03:57,148 --> 01:03:58,308
<i>Get them for me, will you?</i>

578
01:04:03,554 --> 01:04:05,351
<i>Get them for me.</i>

579
01:04:06,491 --> 01:04:08,083
<i>Promise me.</i>

580
01:04:10,528 --> 01:04:12,086
<i>Get them for me.</i>

581
01:04:13,564 --> 01:04:15,191
<i>Promise me.</i>

582
01:04:26,911 --> 01:04:28,242
What's going on?

583
01:04:28,846 --> 01:04:29,972
Excuse me.

584
01:04:33,184 --> 01:04:34,412
Hey, where you going?

585
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:38,013
Unfinished business.

586
01:04:44,162 --> 01:04:45,993
It's okay. He'll be back.

587
01:04:46,164 --> 01:04:47,825
He needs us too.

588
01:04:49,033 --> 01:04:50,125
Where's he going?

589
01:04:52,036 --> 01:04:53,503
To keep a promise.

590
01:04:54,772 --> 01:04:57,832
You got a Robocop.
You got an alien cop?

591
01:04:58,309 --> 01:05:00,869
- Got a ghost cop?
- I don't have time for...

592
01:05:01,045 --> 01:05:02,444
You got a vampire cop?

593
01:05:08,052 --> 01:05:11,044
- Murphy.
- Good evening, Sergeant Reed.

594
01:05:11,389 --> 01:05:14,187
Do you know there's a warrant
out for your arrest?

595
01:05:14,425 --> 01:05:15,449
Yes.

596
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:18,320
I was just checking.
What can I do for you?

597
01:05:18,496 --> 01:05:21,522
Please direct me
to the Rehab Staging Area.

598
01:05:21,866 --> 01:05:24,767
It's down the hall.
You can't miss it.

599
01:05:25,436 --> 01:05:26,403
Thank you.

600
01:05:31,375 --> 01:05:33,935
You may want to call
the fire department.

601
01:05:45,056 --> 01:05:46,853
- You got a light?
- Sure, man.

602
01:05:47,024 --> 01:05:48,582
Allow me, scum.

603
01:06:20,491 --> 01:06:21,480
Oh, shit.

604
01:06:38,042 --> 01:06:39,407
Where's McDaggett?

605
01:06:55,526 --> 01:06:58,154
<i>That does not look like
a police station.</i>

606
01:06:58,329 --> 01:07:00,854
You're damn right
I'm not at the station.

607
01:07:01,032 --> 01:07:04,229
If my spy hadrt warned me,
I'd be dead now.

608
01:07:04,869 --> 01:07:08,327
I thought your damn ninja was
supposed to take care of Robocop.

609
01:07:08,506 --> 01:07:12,966
That's the deal. I clear the area,
he keeps the robot off my back.

610
01:07:13,544 --> 01:07:16,809
<i>You have the device I sent you?</i>

611
01:07:21,018 --> 01:07:24,044
It hasn't come to that yet.
And it won't. Relax.

612
01:07:24,222 --> 01:07:28,522
<i>It is difficult for me to continue
our business relationship...</i>

613
01:07:28,826 --> 01:07:30,987
<i>...when I don't know your methods.</i>

614
01:07:31,329 --> 01:07:33,820
You don't need to know my methods.

615
01:07:33,998 --> 01:07:37,365
I said I'll clear the area
and I'll clear it.

616
01:07:38,336 --> 01:07:41,965
Just get the robot cop off my back.

617
01:07:54,485 --> 01:07:59,115
I understand you're willing to pay good
money to know where the rebel base is.

618
01:07:59,290 --> 01:08:00,279
Yes, well...

619
01:08:02,393 --> 01:08:03,917
...the money's good...

620
01:08:05,396 --> 01:08:06,522
...if the tip's good.

621
01:08:12,470 --> 01:08:15,564
The last tip saved your ass,
didn't it?

622
01:08:33,190 --> 01:08:34,851
What do we have here?

623
01:08:35,826 --> 01:08:37,316
You don't like men in uniform?

624
01:08:37,495 --> 01:08:40,362
My dad lost his job.
I just need some money.

625
01:08:40,531 --> 01:08:43,898
- We've got lots of money, honey.
- Don't.

626
01:08:44,468 --> 01:08:46,868
- No!
- She said, "No."

627
01:08:49,473 --> 01:08:51,771
Maybe you have a hearing problem?

628
01:08:56,847 --> 01:08:58,144
Go home, young lady.

629
01:08:59,417 --> 01:09:01,385
You are in violation of curfew.

630
01:09:12,930 --> 01:09:14,227
Where's McDaggett?

631
01:09:17,768 --> 01:09:19,065
Room 212.

632
01:09:19,270 --> 01:09:20,328
Thank you.

633
01:09:21,439 --> 01:09:23,270
I hope you are insured.

634
01:09:24,976 --> 01:09:26,466
Elevator door sticks!

635
01:09:47,131 --> 01:09:48,155
Don't.

636
01:10:00,845 --> 01:10:03,405
I have a message from officer Lewis.

637
01:10:19,497 --> 01:10:20,794
Stop!

638
01:10:23,267 --> 01:10:24,393
Drive!

639
01:10:25,136 --> 01:10:27,001
I said, drive, goddamn it, drive!

640
01:10:36,113 --> 01:10:40,072
My time, my money. I told you
and won't tell you again, understand?

641
01:10:40,251 --> 01:10:43,550
I must commandeer your vehicle
for police use.

642
01:10:43,888 --> 01:10:46,015
What is your problem, sucker?

643
01:10:48,859 --> 01:10:50,520
I mean, officer.

644
01:12:01,398 --> 01:12:02,365
Cover me.

645
01:12:54,919 --> 01:12:56,318
Commander!

646
01:13:19,176 --> 01:13:21,269
What's the deal?

647
01:13:33,090 --> 01:13:35,388
Where the hell is Robocop?

648
01:13:37,094 --> 01:13:40,188
We could drive around
and listen for explosions.

649
01:13:47,938 --> 01:13:48,927
Are you doing that?

650
01:13:49,106 --> 01:13:52,303
I got tired of splicing wires,
so I put in a pulse tach decoder.

651
01:13:52,476 --> 01:13:54,307
- Telemetric?
- No.

652
01:13:54,478 --> 01:13:57,777
- Smart ass.
- I know you are, but what am I?

653
01:13:58,449 --> 01:13:59,973
Here, let me try.

654
01:14:10,894 --> 01:14:12,987
Thanks for the heart attack.

655
01:14:13,163 --> 01:14:16,530
I believe I will go
and send out a recon team.

656
01:14:17,067 --> 01:14:18,796
I got a better idea.

657
01:14:19,570 --> 01:14:22,164
Why don't we just all have a seat.

658
01:14:22,973 --> 01:14:24,201
And relax.

659
01:14:24,775 --> 01:14:27,073
It'll all be over in a few minutes.

660
01:14:27,411 --> 01:14:29,777
You son of a bitch.

661
01:14:30,014 --> 01:14:32,414
Watch the language,
there's children present.

662
01:14:36,353 --> 01:14:37,945
Drop it, Coontz.

663
01:14:40,324 --> 01:14:43,191
I'm not going to ask twice.

664
01:14:48,532 --> 01:14:51,797
What do you mean, "it'll all be over
in a few minutes"?

665
01:14:54,872 --> 01:14:57,102
Get the kids out of here! Now!

666
01:15:11,388 --> 01:15:12,980
Bertha!

667
01:15:17,861 --> 01:15:18,828
Go.

668
01:15:22,399 --> 01:15:24,390
- Got to get her.
- Go!

669
01:15:26,136 --> 01:15:27,831
Come on, let's go! Come on!

670
01:15:48,058 --> 01:15:49,286
Come on.

671
01:15:54,098 --> 01:15:56,089
Come on! Get in! Come on!

672
01:15:58,569 --> 01:15:59,536
Come on!

673
01:16:03,173 --> 01:16:04,162
Okay, now go!

674
01:16:04,942 --> 01:16:07,968
- Go on!
- No, it's happening again!

675
01:16:08,145 --> 01:16:10,045
Don't let them take you away.

676
01:16:16,353 --> 01:16:18,014
I said, go! Get out of here!

677
01:16:34,204 --> 01:16:35,330
Where is he?

678
01:16:37,975 --> 01:16:38,964
Go to hell.

679
01:16:39,376 --> 01:16:41,105
Take her to headquarters.

680
01:16:41,311 --> 01:16:44,246
I promise my men won't leave
a mark on you.

681
01:16:49,887 --> 01:16:53,084
Sir. What about our friend Coontz?

682
01:16:54,224 --> 01:16:57,250
If we'd let him live,
we'd have to have paid him.

683
01:17:06,870 --> 01:17:10,169
We're talking about hundreds
of thousands of dollars in damage.

684
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:13,366
- Murphy can be rough on properties.
- Yeah. Well...

685
01:17:13,544 --> 01:17:16,911
...every cent of it will be coming out
of your salaries.

686
01:17:17,281 --> 01:17:19,340
Hey! You built him!

687
01:17:27,391 --> 01:17:29,052
We're taking Cadillac Heights.

688
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:33,958
I'll need 50 of your men armed and in full
body armor in one hour. Johnson...

689
01:17:34,164 --> 01:17:38,863
...tell the CEo the demolition crews will
have access at 0600 hours tomorrow.

690
01:17:39,036 --> 01:17:42,472
Hey, we don't do that kind of work.

691
01:17:42,773 --> 01:17:44,934
That was a direct order, sergeant.

692
01:17:45,142 --> 01:17:48,475
Driving people out of their homes
is no work for a cop!

693
01:17:48,812 --> 01:17:49,972
Now, sergeant.

694
01:17:51,348 --> 01:17:54,977
Fifteen years on the force
is quite an investment.

695
01:17:55,185 --> 01:17:56,948
Your job, your pension.

696
01:17:57,254 --> 01:18:01,850
Maybe instead of worrying about these
squatters, think about your own family.

697
01:18:02,993 --> 01:18:04,187
I am.

698
01:18:13,203 --> 01:18:16,070
I'm thinking I have to go home
and face them.

699
01:18:32,389 --> 01:18:34,016
You can't do this.

700
01:18:37,060 --> 01:18:39,858
You are employees of oCP!

701
01:18:40,030 --> 01:18:41,224
Now remember that.

702
01:18:43,133 --> 01:18:46,102
You're jeopardizing
your retirement benefits!

703
01:18:59,116 --> 01:19:00,174
Stop that man.

704
01:19:05,956 --> 01:19:08,925
How would you and your friends
like to make some money?

705
01:19:21,405 --> 01:19:22,337
<i>- It's...
- Johnny...</i>

706
01:19:22,506 --> 01:19:23,871
<i>- Rehab!
- Hurray!</i>

707
01:19:38,889 --> 01:19:42,848
<i>Johnny Rehab action figures, parts
and accessories all sold separately.</i>

708
01:19:43,894 --> 01:19:46,089
<i>Three nuns and five clergy are dead...</i>

709
01:19:46,263 --> 01:19:50,461
<i>...in what is believed to be the latest
atrocity by the killer cyborg, Robocop.</i>

710
01:19:50,901 --> 01:19:52,960
<i>The OCP claim the former police unit...</i>

711
01:19:53,136 --> 01:19:56,003
<i>...is responsible for a spree
of terrorism...</i>

712
01:19:56,173 --> 01:20:00,007
<i>...in the Cadillac Heights section
of Old Detroit.</i>

713
01:20:00,911 --> 01:20:02,936
<i>I'm sorry, I can't even read this.</i>

714
01:20:04,047 --> 01:20:06,447
<i>This is bullshit!
Are you buying this?</i>

715
01:20:07,584 --> 01:20:10,917
Are you kidding me? Robocop?

716
01:21:12,883 --> 01:21:14,180
Marie.

717
01:21:27,397 --> 01:21:28,989
Lousy sons of bitches!

718
01:21:29,900 --> 01:21:33,301
<i>- OCP bastards!
- Nobody is listening to you, sweetheart.</i>

719
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:37,907
<i>We are in position.</i>

720
01:21:38,075 --> 01:21:42,011
This is Big Stick. You have a green.
Arm and proceed to strike zone.

721
01:21:42,779 --> 01:21:44,974
<i>All teams, we have a green.</i>

722
01:21:45,182 --> 01:21:47,810
<i>All teams, we have a green.</i>

723
01:21:48,852 --> 01:21:50,251
Hey, take it easy.

724
01:22:14,511 --> 01:22:17,503
- So what now?
- What now?

725
01:22:17,914 --> 01:22:21,406
- Game's over, Moreno. Just shut up.
- What about Bertha's plan?

726
01:22:22,052 --> 01:22:24,077
Damn it! Bertha's dead!

727
01:22:27,390 --> 01:22:29,017
I'm sorry.

728
01:22:52,983 --> 01:22:55,281
Folks, in about 45 minutes...

729
01:22:55,418 --> 01:22:58,785
...the Rehabs are coming
to blow you out of your neighborhood.

730
01:22:58,955 --> 01:23:00,354
I want you to take your kids...

731
01:23:00,557 --> 01:23:04,015
...and anybody who shouldn't be fighting
to the basement!

732
01:23:04,761 --> 01:23:08,891
The rest of you are hereby deputized
by the Detroit Police Department.

733
01:23:10,867 --> 01:23:13,768
It's time to show
how real cops kick ass.

734
01:24:30,013 --> 01:24:33,278
Detroit Police! Identify yourself.

735
01:24:38,488 --> 01:24:41,184
You are under arrest
for assaulting an officer.

736
01:24:52,168 --> 01:24:54,864
And destruction of police property.

737
01:25:36,012 --> 01:25:37,070
Quiet!

738
01:25:37,247 --> 01:25:38,441
Quiet!

739
01:25:42,319 --> 01:25:46,551
Hold your fire
until absolutely necessary.

740
01:27:13,977 --> 01:27:15,001
Commander...

741
01:27:15,178 --> 01:27:18,409
...Detroit Police are out there, sir.
They're fighting against us.

742
01:27:18,581 --> 01:27:21,414
So? We have a schedule to keep.

743
01:27:21,584 --> 01:27:25,281
We don't fire on police officers!
You're out of line, McDaggett.

744
01:27:25,455 --> 01:27:27,889
I'm in charge here. I'm pulling the plug.

745
01:27:28,291 --> 01:27:29,417
Sit down.

746
01:27:29,793 --> 01:27:31,192
Have you gone war-wacky?

747
01:27:34,864 --> 01:27:38,027
I said, sit down.

748
01:27:40,770 --> 01:27:41,896
Good idea.

749
01:27:48,945 --> 01:27:50,435
How are we getting out of here anyway?

750
01:27:54,818 --> 01:27:56,877
How'd you get...? Never mind.

751
01:27:57,053 --> 01:27:58,782
Is there a transmission dish outside?

752
01:27:58,955 --> 01:28:02,356
Yeah, and I was just watching
the Media Break guy pick his nose.

753
01:28:02,525 --> 01:28:04,459
Do you have your computer with you?

754
01:28:09,165 --> 01:28:10,496
<i>People of Detroit...</i>

755
01:28:10,900 --> 01:28:14,392
<i>...this is an illegal broadcast.
It may be cut off at any time.</i>

756
01:28:14,571 --> 01:28:16,232
<i>So listen to me.</i>

757
01:28:16,406 --> 01:28:18,340
<i>OCP is lying to you.</i>

758
01:28:18,508 --> 01:28:21,068

759
01:28:25,515 --> 01:28:27,142
<i>Those Rehabs you see on TV...</i>

760
01:28:27,350 --> 01:28:31,878
<i>...they're mercenaries hired by OCP
to throw people out of their homes.</i>

761
01:28:40,530 --> 01:28:42,430
<i>You've got to believe me.</i>

762
01:28:43,166 --> 01:28:46,101
<i>I'm speaking for all the homeless

763
01:28:46,269 --> 01:28:50,433
<i>...and every city like it run by
heartless capitalist scumbags...</i>

764

OCP cares about...</i>

<i>Time's running out. OCP's the enemy.</i>

767
01:29:17,100 --> 01:29:22,060
<i>I repeat. Time is running out.
OCP is the enemy.</i>

768
01:29:22,472 --> 01:29:24,906
<i>Help us. Innocent people are dying.</i>

769
01:29:54,771 --> 01:29:56,796
- More ammo!
- More ammo!

770
01:30:18,461 --> 01:30:19,450
Zack's hit!

771
01:30:25,535 --> 01:30:28,060
They're winning, aren't they, sergeant?

772
01:30:39,549 --> 01:30:41,278
What in the name...?

773
01:31:10,847 --> 01:31:12,109
Sir?

774
01:31:26,195 --> 01:31:28,789
Splatter that, you sons of bitches!

775
01:31:47,784 --> 01:31:49,183
<i>Come in, Big Stick.</i>

776
01:31:53,323 --> 01:31:55,814
All right, Mr. Robocop.

777
01:31:56,059 --> 01:31:57,356
Come and get me.

778
01:32:01,531 --> 01:32:03,055
Get away from the door.

779
01:32:17,413 --> 01:32:18,937
Think it over.

780
01:32:20,950 --> 01:32:23,976
Oh, my God, Johnson,
our stock has dropped to nothing.

781
01:32:24,253 --> 01:32:25,345
We're ruined.

782
01:32:44,340 --> 01:32:46,433
How may I help you, officer?

783
01:32:46,943 --> 01:32:48,570
By resisting arrest.

784
01:32:48,911 --> 01:32:50,811
Don't count on it, chum.

785
01:32:51,214 --> 01:32:53,114
Anyway, what's the charge?

786
01:32:53,282 --> 01:32:55,944
The murder of Anne Lewis.

787
01:32:57,887 --> 01:33:00,412
Dead or alive, you're coming with me.

788
01:33:27,583 --> 01:33:32,543
McDaggett, you can have oCP.
It's all yours. Sayonara.

789
01:33:32,889 --> 01:33:34,379
Where're you going?

790
01:33:34,557 --> 01:33:36,491
You're gonna miss all the fun.

791
01:34:24,440 --> 01:34:27,307
No flashy bravery, tin man.

792
01:34:27,477 --> 01:34:29,536
Or the two cuties say, "Bye-bye."

793
01:34:30,079 --> 01:34:31,842
What are you doing?

794
01:34:32,014 --> 01:34:33,413
What are you doing?

795
01:34:41,557 --> 01:34:43,889
Stop them! Stop them!

796
01:34:53,536 --> 01:34:55,766
Stupid fools!

797
01:34:55,938 --> 01:34:58,429
Don't you know what you've done to us?!

798
01:34:59,475 --> 01:35:02,774
Those androids are programmed
with a thermal fail-safe device.

799
01:35:04,413 --> 01:35:06,142
You mean to self-destruct?

800
01:35:06,349 --> 01:35:08,977
In 15 seconds,
everything within 20 yards...

801
01:35:09,151 --> 01:35:11,551
...of where we're standing
will be atomized.

802
01:35:11,888 --> 01:35:14,254
We're dead, you stupid slag.

803
01:35:14,423 --> 01:35:16,891
Don't count on it, chum.

804
01:35:26,135 --> 01:35:27,864
Hang on.

805
01:35:51,527 --> 01:35:54,826
- Come on.
- Let me give you a hand.

806
01:36:22,391 --> 01:36:24,859
Kanemitsu-san...

807
01:36:25,061 --> 01:36:27,029
...I realize that it looks bad...

808
01:36:27,196 --> 01:36:30,063
...but maybe our plans were
over-ambitious.

809
01:36:30,232 --> 01:36:32,792
Let's start a skoshy bit smaller.

810
01:36:32,969 --> 01:36:36,564
Let's gentrify this neighborhood.
Build strip malls.

811
01:36:36,906 --> 01:36:40,899
Fast-food chains. Lots of popular
entertainment. What do you think?

812
01:36:46,882 --> 01:36:48,372
- What did he say?
- You're fired.

813
01:37:18,180 --> 01:37:20,205
I got to hand it to you.

814
01:37:21,384 --> 01:37:22,976
What do they call you?

815
01:37:23,452 --> 01:37:25,420
Murphy, is it?

816
01:37:25,488 --> 01:37:27,786
My friends call me Murphy.

817
01:37:31,060 --> 01:37:32,459
You call me...

818
01:37:32,762 --> 01:37:34,093
...Robocop.
