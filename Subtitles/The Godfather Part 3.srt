2
00:01:53,906 --> 00:01:58,367
It is now better than several years
since I moved to New York

3
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,413
and I haven't seen you
as much as I would like to.

4
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,543
I hope you will come to this
ceremony of Papal honors,

5
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:10,046
given for my charitable work.

6
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:15,468
The only wealth
in this world is children.

7
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:18,471
More than all the money
and power on earth,

8
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:22,058
you are my treasure.

9
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,853
Anthony and Mary,

10
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:30,900
although I entrusted your education to
your mother for your own best interest,

11
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:36,072
I look forward to seeing you, and to
a new period of harmony in our lives.

12
00:02:38,242 --> 00:02:42,787
Perhaps you might prevail upon your
mother to come to this celebration,

13
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:48,167
and that from time to time, we can all
see each other at family functions.

14
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:53,965
Anyway, I remain your loving father.

15
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:26,455
Hail Mary, full of grace...

16
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,628
...blessed art Thou amongst women...

17
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,549
...and blessed is the fruit
of Thy womb, Jesus.

18
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:42,179
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners...

19
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:13,210
Almighty God, bless the insignia
of Saint Sebastian the martyr,

20
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:19,133
that it may contribute to the sacredness
of him to whom it is given.

21
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:35,274
Do you, Michael, promise to be faithful

22
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:37,985
to the noble purposes of this Order,

23
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:43,574
to have a special care for the poor,
the needy and those who are ill?

24
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:45,534
I do so promise.

25
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:03,886
May the blessing of Almighty God,

26
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:09,016
Father, Son and Holy Spirit

27
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:14,146
descend upon you
and remain with you forever.

28
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,951
Vincent, our name is not on the list.

29
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:57,583
Write it in. Mancini. M-A-N-C-I-N-I.

30
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:01,629
-Problem?
-My name isn't on the list.

31
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:06,509
-Then you have to leave immediately.
-You want to dance with me?

32
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:09,804
Joe, it's Vinnie. These are our guests.

33
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:11,931
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, sir.

34
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:14,308
Welcome to the party.

35
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:11,657
-It's good to see you.
-Good to see you. This is my husband.

36
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,951
-Sit down.
-My son, Anthony.

37
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:20,374
The Order of Saint Sebastian is one of
the highest honors the Church awards.

38
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,793
It was first granted by Pope...

39
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:26,255
What about Mr. Corleone's connections
with gambling?

40
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:28,382
The press kits have...

41
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,759
What about his involvement
with the underworld?

42
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,011
Cut the crap.

43
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:35,764
The Pope, the Holy Father himself,

44
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:40,519
has today blessed Michael Corleone.
Do you know better than the Pope?

45
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:44,523
Vincent! She loves you.

46
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:46,275
Yeah?

47
00:08:50,322 --> 00:08:51,947
I love you too.

48
00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:00,789
Hi, Vincent. I remember you.

49
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:06,670
-From where?
-The last party we were at together.

50
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:09,882
-Did you come to the club?
-No, it was a wedding.

51
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,845
I was eight and you were 15.

52
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:18,974
I had many girlfriends when I was 15.

53
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:21,185
-Eight-year-olds?
-Especially them.

54
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:25,731
Where's Mary?

55
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:30,778
Would somebody please hail Mary?
Excuse me, Your Excellency.

56
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:34,865
You haven't kissed me hello yet.
Relatives always kiss.

57
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:38,577
-Now we're related?
-I'm your little cousin.

58
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:49,505
-Who's your father?
-I'll give you a hint.

59
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,508
He's Italian.

60
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,928
Mary, we've been waiting for you.

61
00:09:56,012 --> 00:10:00,266
Remember to keep your voice low.

62
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,851
And smile. Don't forget to smile.

63
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:27,418
The honorary chairman of
the Vito Corleone Foundation,

64
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:29,712
my daughter, Mary Corleone.

65
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:40,931
Thanks.

66
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:47,229
I think I inherited my father's love
for speechmaking. Here it goes.

67
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:53,527
The Vito Corleone Foundation helps
the poor in every country,

68
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:57,698
gives grants to artists,
funds medical research,

69
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:02,619
and is particularly dedicated
to the resurrection of Sicily.

70
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,456
Archbishop Gilday,

71
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:11,920
here is 100 million dollars for the poor
of Sicily, in the name of Vito Corleone.

72
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:14,923
Don't spend it all in one place.

73
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:38,072
Mary, I'm so proud of you.

74
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,830
Michael...

75
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:49,750
You've done a wonderful thing for Sicily.

76
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:54,254
Let's hope that the money gets
to the people who need it.

77
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:55,631
Amen.

78
00:11:55,715 --> 00:12:00,844
...the most important part:
Johnny Fontane!

79
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:12,606
Thank you very much.
I'm happy to be here.

80
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:18,362
I would like you to join me in honoring
Commendatore Michael Corleone.

81
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:25,994
I have something special
for our godfather.

82
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:30,624
I happen to know his favorite song.
Michael, where are you going?

83
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:34,420
I'm off to the kitchen
to hear some Tony Bennett records.

84
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:38,257
Your favorite song, "Salsiccia's Own”.

85
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:41,427
I'm having a salsiccia sandwich.
I'll be back.

86
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,463
Hello, Kay.

87
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:30,726
Congratulations, Michael.
That's quite an honor.

88
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,812
But a little expensive, wouldn't you say?

89
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:39,651
-Cake?
-No, thank you.

90
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,835
-It's been a long time, hasn't it?
-Yeah.

91
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,879
-Eight years.
-Yeah.

92
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:01,507
You look wonderful.

93
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:09,765
Your son has something he wants to
talk to you about. I came here for him.

94
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:49,972
-What's wrong with being a lawyer?
-He wants his life to be in music.

95
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:56,186
Music is great, I love music.
But he should finish what he started.

96
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:57,646
Anthony...

97
00:14:58,273 --> 00:15:00,691
-I'm going my own way.
-Your own way?

98
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:03,527
-Professional singer?
-Yes.

99
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:06,738
What happens if you fail?

100
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:10,033
-I won't fail.
-Men always believe that.

101
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:14,329
A law degree is like taking
out insurance.

102
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:19,042
-After that you can work for me...
-I will never work for you.

103
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,170
I have bad memories.

104
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:26,425
Every family has bad memories.

105
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:34,725
I'll always be your son, but won't have
anything to do with your business.

106
00:15:37,312 --> 00:15:40,731
Anthony... finish the law degree.

107
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:43,442
No.

108
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,838
Well, that he got from you. That "no”.

109
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:12,971
-You could've helped me convince him.
-Convince him of what?

110
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,931
Of what?

111
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:20,395
He throws his life away.
He throws greatness away.

112
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,231
This is greatness?

113
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:29,196
Now that you're so respectable,
you're more dangerous than ever.

114
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:33,408
I preferred you when you were
just a common Mafia hood.

115
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:35,827
Okay.

116
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:40,540
-Can we talk common sense here?
-All right.

117
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:49,758
Tony knows that you killed Fredo.

118
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:59,851
-What did you come here for?
-To protect my son.

119
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:04,898
Not to see you disguised by your
church. That was a shameful ceremony.

120
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:12,155
I spent my life protecting my son.

121
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,243
I spent my life protecting my family!

122
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:18,453
Let's be reasonable, okay?

123
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:24,042
That's your big thing, isn't it, Michael?
Reason,

124
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:28,547
-backed up by murder.
-Oh, God.

125
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:33,760
-You hate me. You hate me.
-No.

126
00:17:33,845 --> 00:17:35,679
I don't hate you.

127
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,099
I dread you.

128
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:49,151
I did what I could, Kay, to protect all
of you from the horrors of this world.

129
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,738
But you became my horror.

130
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:05,917
The children still love you, though.
Especially Mary.

131
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:10,756
That's something.

132
00:18:13,176 --> 00:18:16,678
We can build on that. For their sake,

133
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:22,017
let's try.

134
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:28,023
Only if you let Tony go free to have
his own life, away from you.

135
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:37,115
I'll let Tony go.

136
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:41,203
Thank you.

137
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:17,948
-Hi.
-Hi.

138
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:25,205
You could hurt somebody with those.
Let me show you around.

139
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:27,666
Can you get me an interview
with Corleone?

140
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:32,003
No. I'm a relative, but I can't do that.
What else can I do for you?

141
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:36,383
-Handsome, but useless.
-Oh, yeah?

142
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:39,344
-That's okay, I'll gamble.
-Do you like to gamble?

143
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:43,223
Let's go to Atlantic City.
I'll show you how to gamble.

144
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:48,144
-How do I know what numbers to bet?
-Do I look like a guy who's gonna lose?

145
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:49,479
Well...

146
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:54,109
Spooky-looking guy there.

147
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:59,739
-What's a guy like that doing here?
-That's Joey Zasa's bulldog.

148
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:01,908
-You know him?
-Yeah, I do.

149
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:07,289
His name is Anthony Squigilaro.
They call him "The Ant".

150
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:10,417
He dips his bullets in cyanide.

151
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,844
Don Altobello.

152
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:25,765
-I've come to pay my respects.
-Grazie.

153
00:20:29,312 --> 00:20:31,771
You honor my father's friendship.

154
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:33,940
Where is my goddaughter?

155
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,986
-Constanza!
-Don Altobello.

156
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:43,074
It was not so long ago
that I held you in these old hands.

157
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:56,755
Michael, I've lost all the venom,
all the juice of youth.

158
00:20:56,839 --> 00:21:02,052
I've lost the lust for women,
and now my mind is clear.

159
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:09,142
My duty to God is clear.
I have a special favor to ask of you.

160
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:17,609
Can I attach my name
to the Vito Corleone Foundation,

161
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:23,323
so that you and I can be joined
in name and spirit?

162
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:30,705
-One million dollars.
-A lot of money...

163
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:37,462
-Godfather.
-Don Altobello, you have such a heart.

164
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:44,719
Come, let's go and sample
some of that old vino.

165
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:55,021
The Vatican knows nothing
about these shareholders.

166
00:21:55,106 --> 00:21:56,314
Good.

167
00:21:56,399 --> 00:22:01,277
I have a tendency to worry. We've
increased our position substantially.

168
00:22:01,404 --> 00:22:05,949
-Naturally, I worry.
-Stop worrying, we have an agreement.

169
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:09,869
Good. How do you think
I got this gray hair?

170
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:15,709
Two seconds... Thank you for your
contribution to the swimming-pool.

171
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:20,005
We need your help on Sam Wallace's
candidacy for judgeship.

172
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:22,716
-We can always use a good judge.
-Thanks.

173
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,467
Andrew!

174
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:28,471
My godson Andrew Hagen.
My brother Tom's eldest boy.

175
00:22:28,556 --> 00:22:33,059
He's been assistant to Bishop Breelan
for three years.

176
00:22:33,144 --> 00:22:37,480
-Hopes to be assigned to the Vatican.
-Rome needs fine young priests.

177
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:40,608
His mother Teresa Hagen,
Bishop Gilday.

178
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,069
Honored to meet you.

179
00:22:43,154 --> 00:22:46,156
Mr. Corleone. Hi. Grace Hamilton.

180
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:51,995
Vincent Mancini promised to tell you
about me. That maybe you'd see me.

181
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:55,415
-Did Vincent Mancini call about her?
-No.

182
00:22:55,499 --> 00:23:00,003
-You promised to stay out there, twice.
-I know.

183
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:04,966
Joey Zasa showed up.
He's waiting in the lobby.

184
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:09,429
He wants to personally
congratulate you. Show his respect.

185
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:14,476
-Do I have to see him?
-He says you're his patron.

186
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,814
Hey, Vinnie!

187
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:23,485
-Who's your favorite aunt?
-You are.

188
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:29,657
Today I'll talk to Michael
about your little problem.

189
00:23:30,493 --> 00:23:33,703
If you'd warned me, I would have
worn a better suit.

190
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:38,083
The Meucci Association has elected you

191
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:40,794
Italian-American Man of the Year.

192
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:44,047
Meucci...

193
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:48,551
Who's Meucci?

194
00:23:49,804 --> 00:23:55,850
The Italian-American who invented
the telephone, one year before Bell.

195
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:02,649
And this is the reason
you've come today?

196
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:11,074
I...

197
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:16,746
I've got a stone in my shoe.

198
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:20,542
A two-bit punk who works for me.

199
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:24,796
The one who thinks he's related to you.

200
00:24:27,258 --> 00:24:28,591
A bastard.

201
00:24:32,555 --> 00:24:36,975
He's here. Vincent Mancini.
He's at the party.

202
00:24:40,354 --> 00:24:41,855
Bring him in.

203
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:45,733
I think it's good that we talk.

204
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,570
No, grazie.

205
00:24:50,573 --> 00:24:52,407
I have a problem...

206
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:59,247
...and I want to find out if it is
my problem or your problem.

207
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:04,419
Your business is your business. I have
no interests or percentages from it.

208
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:09,007
Good. Then it's my problem.

209
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:17,807
Michael, you know Vincent Mancini.
Sonny's boy.

210
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:22,896
-How are you, Mr. Corleone?
-How are you?

211
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:26,816
-Good. How are you? Good party.
-You like it?

212
00:25:26,901 --> 00:25:30,111
-Yes, I had to sneak in.
-You're dressed for it.

213
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:38,786
So, what's the trouble
between you and Mr. Joe Zasa?

214
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:45,335
-Just trouble. I'll take care of it.
-That's foolish of you.

215
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:50,340
Foolish of me? It's a little foolish
of this guy, don't you think? Right?

216
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:55,303
-Right?
-Temper like his father...

217
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,305
Vincent...

218
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:04,979
Mr. Joe Zasa now owns what used to
be the Corleone business in New York.

219
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:08,942
Out of kindness, he gave you
a job in his family.

220
00:26:09,026 --> 00:26:11,653
You took it against my advice.

221
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:17,033
I offered you something better in the
legitimate world. You turned me down.

222
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:22,121
Now you both come to me with this bad
blood. What do you expect me to do?

223
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,750
-Am I a gangster?
-No...

224
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:30,672
That was Papa's neighborhood.
Zasa runs it like a disgrace!

225
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:35,009
-That's the past, Connie.
-I earned that territory.

226
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:38,763
The Commission gave it to me
and you approved.

227
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:39,931
Yes.

228
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:44,769
I came for the party, not to ask for help.
I could kill this bastard.

229
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,312
So kill him.

230
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:50,942
What does all this have to do with me?

231
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:56,239
Well, he goes behind your back,
saying "Fuck Michael Corleone".

232
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:59,033
Say it to his face, one time!

233
00:27:00,494 --> 00:27:05,665
Mr. Corleone, all bastards are liars.
Shakespeare wrote poems about it.

234
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:08,793
What am I going to do with this guy?

235
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:19,721
Joey, if there's some guy
running around this city,

236
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:22,432
saying, "Fuck Michael Corleone"...

237
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:27,103
...what do we do
with a piece of shit like that?

238
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,482
He's a fucking dog.

239
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:42,160
Yes, it's true.
If anyone would say such a thing,

240
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:45,663
they would not be a friend,
they would be a dog.

241
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:58,092
-My interests don't conflict with his.
-You don't know how much they do.

242
00:27:58,177 --> 00:27:59,635
Quiet, Vincent.

243
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,929
He needs your support!

244
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:04,766
Don't let me work for this guy,
let me work for you.

245
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:10,897
As what? Tough guy? I don't need
tough guys. I need more lawyers.

246
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:20,323
Since we have no conflicts or debts,
I accept your tribute. I wish you well.

247
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:26,579
Vincent, make your peace
with Mr. Joe Zasa. Go on.

248
00:28:37,633 --> 00:28:39,008
Bastardo...

249
00:28:44,807 --> 00:28:47,642
Vinnie, what's the matter with you?

250
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,644
Get him out of here.

251
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:53,439
Jesus Christ...

252
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:56,401
-I told Connie this wasn't the right time.
-Close it.

253
00:28:56,485 --> 00:29:01,781
I know you're into Wall Street,
but you're still the final word.

254
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:04,826
I want to protect you from these guys.
Your lawyers can't.

255
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:07,537
-But you can?
-Yeah, I can do that.

256
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:11,082
Why should I be afraid of Zasa?

257
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:14,544
You stop him from rising
in the Commission.

258
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:17,964
I say we make him dead.
Give me the order, I'll do it.

259
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:19,632
-You'll do it?
-Yeah.

260
00:29:24,346 --> 00:29:29,100
Maybe you should come with me
for a few weeks. See what happens.

261
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,853
-Okay.
-See if you learn.

262
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:35,982
And we'll talk about your future.

263
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:39,402
I won't let you down.

264
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:47,910
It's about ready.

265
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:55,209
So, what happened?

266
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:56,502
What happened?

267
00:29:56,587 --> 00:29:59,922
If I'm in a room with Zasa,
what happens? I bit his ear off.

268
00:30:00,007 --> 00:30:02,258
Here we go. Watch the card.

269
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,471
Hold it!

270
00:30:08,724 --> 00:30:10,475
-Vincent...
-Yeah.

271
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,852
Take the picture with us.

272
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:21,694
Nice jacket.

273
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:26,282
Closer to the center, sir.

274
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,161
Smile!

275
00:30:50,516 --> 00:30:55,102
Godfather, this is the cake for you
and your family from Enzo the baker.

276
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:58,314
Do you want to do it?

277
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:47,655
Cent'anni! Cent'anni!

278
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:50,134
-Vincent?
-What do you want, sweetheart?

279
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:54,138
Do you love me?

280
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:58,184
-Come on, go to bed.
-Come on, say it.

281
00:33:00,062 --> 00:33:01,896
I love you.

282
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:04,565
I love you, too.

283
00:33:07,069 --> 00:33:08,778
You've got a cat?

284
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:18,496
Go get us some water, I'm thirsty.
Come on.

285
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:20,915
Come on.

286
00:33:28,382 --> 00:33:31,133
Well, I guess I know my place.

287
00:33:32,052 --> 00:33:34,887
I can't believe I'm actually doing this.

288
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:39,350
"Get me water, bake me a cake"...
What happened to "please"?

289
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:29,734
Good boy, Sackface. Go for a walk.

290
00:34:39,161 --> 00:34:41,996
-Let her go.
-Cut her throat, man.

291
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:47,710
-What did you say?
-Cut her fucking throat.

292
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:54,091
-Okay, chief...
-Drop your gun or he'll cut her throat.

293
00:34:54,176 --> 00:34:58,429
I hardly know her, so cut her.
What the fuck do I care?

294
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:04,059
You've got no choice. She'll be dead.

295
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:08,105
If you do, I'll kill you both.
Give up that knife, I'll let you go.

296
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:10,775
Cut her throat! Right now!

297
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:17,072
I'll do something that'll convince you.
Don't get frightened. Just watch me.

298
00:35:21,912 --> 00:35:23,496
Oh, shit!

299
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:28,042
Drop the knife. Drop it!

300
00:35:28,168 --> 00:35:34,882
Good boy. Sit down, I want to talk
to you. It was a wise choice. Sit down.

301
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,550
Lose the mask.

302
00:35:39,888 --> 00:35:42,306
Relax, have a smoke. You smoke?

303
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,603
Whose idea was this? Who sent you?

304
00:35:48,355 --> 00:35:51,232
Tell me who sent you.

305
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:56,195
-No one.
-Did you take a look at this guy?

306
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:58,405
-Yeah.
-Who sent you?

307
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:03,410
It was Joey Zasa.

308
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:19,760
Are you okay?

309
00:36:22,973 --> 00:36:26,141
-You were going to let them kill me!
-No, I wasn't...

310
00:36:26,226 --> 00:36:28,769
You pig! You sick fuck!

311
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:34,567
You wanted gambling. That's gambling.
Call the police.

312
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:42,908
-You killed the other guy too?
-He went for my gun.

313
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:46,829
It was self-defense.
Go ahead, call the police.

314
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:50,082
-No, no...
-I'm taking pictures.

315
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:51,792
No pictures.

316
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:54,962
You had a gun!

317
00:36:55,380 --> 00:37:00,301
They only had a knife. You could have
handed them over to the police.

318
00:37:01,136 --> 00:37:04,179
Zasa sent them.
I just sent him a message.

319
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:10,561
-Now he has to send you one back.
-Zasa is going to send me one back?

320
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:13,480
He did the right thing.
He got Zasa's name!

321
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:17,401
What has Joey Zasa to do
with anything? Joey Zasa is a pazzo.

322
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:23,449
All right. You are what you are.

323
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:27,119
It's your nature. Stay close to me.

324
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:31,415
Don't do anything. Keep your mouth
shut and your eyes open.

325
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:34,293
-And you do what I tell you.
-I understand.

326
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:37,713
-I have problems with the Commission.
-I know.

327
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:42,593
-You don't make them easier.
-It wasn't my idea that this happened.

328
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:45,930
-Get out of here.
-Michael...

329
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,848
Yes?

330
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:53,354
-Now they'll fear you.
-Maybe they should fear you.

331
00:37:57,317 --> 00:38:01,111
-B.J., what's up?
-The Archbishop just called back.

332
00:38:01,196 --> 00:38:03,822
We've arranged some amazing things.

333
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:08,160
The publicity is phenomenal. You're the
new Rockefeller. A philanthropist.

334
00:38:10,664 --> 00:38:13,874
-Sign here, please.
-Times do change, don't they?

335
00:38:14,584 --> 00:38:19,129
My father hated foundations.
He loved doing it by himself.

336
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,716
Man to man. But we're different.

337
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:28,430
No different than any large corporation.
We control a lot of money with little.

338
00:38:28,515 --> 00:38:32,893
Minimize taxes.
With no government control.

339
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,405
-Godfather.
-Andrew.

340
00:38:45,782 --> 00:38:51,078
-Off to Rome...
-I wanted to thank you for everything.

341
00:38:51,621 --> 00:38:54,707
-Do you want some breakfast?
-Thanks, I can't.

342
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:59,211
-How's your Italian?
-Devo fare un po' di pratica.

343
00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:02,756
-His father was a great lawyer.
-I know.

344
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:07,511
Didn't live to see him ordained. I did.
Did you ever see one of those?

345
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:11,056
Beautiful. I was so proud.
Let me walk you out.

346
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:15,019
If you hear any rumors in the Vatican,
let me know.

347
00:39:15,103 --> 00:39:17,646
No, Andrew has the true faith.

348
00:39:27,407 --> 00:39:29,366
Don Corleone,

349
00:39:29,451 --> 00:39:33,454
I need your help. And not just
to light a little candle.

350
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:42,004
My gift was to be able to persuade
people to give to the Holy Church.

351
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:47,634
Then Rome decides to put me
in charge of the Vatican Bank...

352
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:52,806
...but I was never a true banker.

353
00:39:55,977 --> 00:40:00,105
Mea culpa. I trusted my friends.

354
00:40:01,483 --> 00:40:03,484
Friendship and money...

355
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:06,403
Oil and water...

356
00:40:06,488 --> 00:40:07,780
Indeed.

357
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:15,120
But these "friends" used the good name
of the Church to feed their greed.

358
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,457
If money was lost...

359
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:21,919
...then I am to blame.

360
00:40:24,214 --> 00:40:28,967
If only prayer could pay off
our 700 million dollar deficit.

361
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:33,305
769 million...

362
00:40:39,229 --> 00:40:44,399
The Church owns 25 percent
of a large corporation. Immobiliare.

363
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,444
You know the one I mean?

364
00:40:47,529 --> 00:40:52,074
Largest landlord on Earth.
Real estate worth six billion dollars.

365
00:40:54,536 --> 00:40:56,286
That's true.

366
00:40:57,038 --> 00:41:00,624
And the Vatican vote
is necessary for control.

367
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:06,004
No, you're mistaken.

368
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:10,968
This isn't a question of one person
deciding. One deciding vote.

369
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:16,890
This is like any other company.
We have directors and very old rules.

370
00:41:17,934 --> 00:41:21,895
The Pope himself
would have to approve you.

371
00:41:26,943 --> 00:41:28,902
We've sold the casinos.

372
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:33,532
All businesses having to do
with gambling.

373
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:40,247
We have no interests or investments
in anything illegitimate.

374
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:47,963
The Corleones are prepared to deposit
500 million dollars in the Vatican Bank

375
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:51,758
when Mr. Corleone receives majority
control of Immobiliare.

376
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:56,763
Immobiliare could be something new.
A European conglomerate.

377
00:41:58,433 --> 00:42:02,311
Few families have control
of such a company.

378
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:08,108
It seems that, in today's world,

379
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:12,988
the power to absolve debt is greater
than the power of forgiveness.

380
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:17,117
600 million dollars.

381
00:42:22,165 --> 00:42:25,209
Don't overestimate
the power of forgiveness.

382
00:42:27,587 --> 00:42:29,379
Don Corleone,

383
00:42:29,464 --> 00:42:34,092
this deal with Immobiliare can make you
one of the richest men in the world.

384
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:39,973
Your whole past history, and the history
of your family, would be washed away.

385
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:45,896
600 million.

386
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:06,124
The motion under discussion
relates to Corleone Group's proposal

387
00:43:07,252 --> 00:43:12,256
to acquire 100,000,000 newly issued
Class A voting shares.

388
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:20,097
...Corleone capital invested directly
into International Immobiliare,

389
00:43:21,182 --> 00:43:24,559
an old and respected
European company.

390
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:30,983
Mr. Corleone has an ambitious program
to expand this real estate company

391
00:43:31,067 --> 00:43:34,069
into an international conglomerate...

392
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:42,828
...by Eastern techniques of efficiency
and focus and unlimited...

393
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:45,122
Mr. Corleone, excuse me.

394
00:43:45,665 --> 00:43:49,001
Didn't you recently deposit 200 million
in the Vatican Bank,

395
00:43:49,085 --> 00:43:52,546
which is affiliated with Immobiliare?

396
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,089
True. Why not?

397
00:43:54,173 --> 00:44:00,637
Wasn't there any questioning about
the timing on this particular deposit?

398
00:44:00,722 --> 00:44:02,931
Mr. Chairman, if I may?

399
00:44:04,684 --> 00:44:09,146
The Vito Andolini Corleone Foundation,
of which Mary Corleone is chairman,

400
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:12,649
has made an endowment
of 100 million dollars.

401
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:17,112
The money comes from his own family
and will be administered by the Vatican.

402
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:19,573
Does that answer your question?

403
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:26,413
I have always believed that helping your
fellow man is profitable in every sense,

404
00:44:26,831 --> 00:44:28,957
personally and bottom line.

405
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:35,339
My fellow shareholders, if Europe
and America can learn to co-operate,

406
00:44:35,423 --> 00:44:39,760
if we can learn to pool our wealth,
share our markets,

407
00:44:39,844 --> 00:44:45,098
we can defeat any competition
anywhere in the world.

408
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:47,684
Thank you for your time.

409
00:44:47,769 --> 00:44:52,564
I hope that you will look favorably
on my proposal. Thank you.

410
00:44:58,613 --> 00:45:01,031
Let me have this microphone here.

411
00:45:01,157 --> 00:45:06,828
Will we let a criminal run our company?
He's got the map of Sicily on his face!

412
00:45:06,913 --> 00:45:08,163
Order!

413
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:10,957
He's either a Catholic or a mafioso...

414
00:45:13,503 --> 00:45:17,297
The Hamilton Investors Group
cannot support this proposal.

415
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:20,467
Your Excellency...

416
00:45:21,386 --> 00:45:22,969
Mr. Chairman...

417
00:45:23,471 --> 00:45:29,184
...the Vatican Bank feels
that International Immobiliare...

418
00:45:31,479 --> 00:45:35,232
...will be safe in Mr. Corleone's hands.

419
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:40,904
...subject to audit and final ratification,
which must take place in Rome.

420
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:44,366
Please join me in welcoming
Mr. Michael Corleone.

421
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:56,336
Dad?

422
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:02,217
Tony says that I'm a front
for the foundation.

423
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:07,097
That you're using me to pull the strings.

424
00:46:07,849 --> 00:46:10,809
-To get the money where you want it.
-Please!

425
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:14,312
-To shine up your public image.
-Mary!

426
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,900
Mary, this is real.
This foundation is real.

427
00:46:21,863 --> 00:46:26,867
I wanted Anthony to be part of it.
I thought you would be together on this.

428
00:46:26,951 --> 00:46:31,413
I won't interfere.
I'll help, but only if you ask.

429
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:33,498
What is this really for?

430
00:46:34,375 --> 00:46:37,544
Why are you doing this?
Why am I doing this?

431
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:43,967
I'm doing this for my children.
You're doing it for your children too.

432
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:48,221
This foundation is supposed to
help all people.

433
00:46:48,306 --> 00:46:50,682
That's the purpose.

434
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:55,353
This is legitimate.
Mary, I swear, this is legitimate.

435
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:02,611
Dad, I want this to bring me
closer to you.

436
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:14,748
I would burn in hell to keep you safe.

437
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:32,015
Go in the other car.
I'll ride with Michael.

438
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:33,767
Go, go, go.

439
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:53,286
As your family's oldest friend, I'm
always chosen to bring you messages.

440
00:47:56,082 --> 00:47:58,250
Tell me, Don Altobello.

441
00:48:00,795 --> 00:48:05,632
Your old partners are grateful for
the money you made them.

442
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:07,509
They worship you...

443
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:14,307
...but their hearts are broken, because
they think you abandoned them.

444
00:48:15,059 --> 00:48:21,398
They want to share your deal
on Immobiliare, to be a family again.

445
00:48:21,482 --> 00:48:23,984
It can purify their money.

446
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,071
This I cannot do.

447
00:48:30,992 --> 00:48:33,827
Immobiliare must be legitimate.

448
00:48:36,247 --> 00:48:37,497
I know.

449
00:48:38,541 --> 00:48:40,584
But they're unhappy.

450
00:48:42,712 --> 00:48:44,004
And you?

451
00:48:45,006 --> 00:48:50,385
I ask nothing for myself.
Only peace in my old age.

452
00:48:51,012 --> 00:48:54,097
But I must please the world around me.

453
00:48:56,183 --> 00:49:02,063
Michael, your father was
a reasonable man. Learn from him.

454
00:49:04,609 --> 00:49:07,736
I learned many things from my father.

455
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:18,913
Call a meeting, my friend,
so there are no debts or grudges.

456
00:49:20,166 --> 00:49:23,001
We will make the peace, you and I.

457
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:42,937
The Vatican announced today...

458
00:49:43,064 --> 00:49:46,858
that Pope Paul VI has canceled
his Sunday blessing...

459
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:48,818
due to ill health.

460
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:51,946
His physician has ordered
total bedrest...

461
00:49:52,198 --> 00:49:54,908
and cessation of all activities.

462
00:50:02,917 --> 00:50:04,959
They've had a press conference.

463
00:50:05,044 --> 00:50:08,213
The Pope's condition
is grave. "Gravissimo.”

464
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:40,453
The purpose of this meeting
is to ratify...

465
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:44,207
the motion passed by our
shareholders in New York.

466
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:47,252
Please...

467
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:52,882
Our group represents a consortium
of Catholic businessmen

468
00:50:52,967 --> 00:50:55,802
against the Corleone control.

469
00:50:56,804 --> 00:51:02,058
The Vatican has cast its vote. Corleone
Group already controls the Board.

470
00:51:02,143 --> 00:51:06,730
According to the Lateran Treaty,
the Vatican vote must be ratified here.

471
00:51:06,814 --> 00:51:08,982
Here in Rome, by the Pope.

472
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:16,156
The Pope is gravely ill.

473
00:51:17,658 --> 00:51:21,202
Until he recovers, I am powerless.

474
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:25,498
-What if he dies?
-Then...

475
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:29,836
...as you Americans say, all bets are off.

476
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,838
Gentlemen, please.

477
00:51:33,257 --> 00:51:36,593
This is a brief delay. Nothing more.

478
00:51:41,682 --> 00:51:43,975
Your Excellency, gentlemen...

479
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:50,440
I advise you to join us in our prayers
for the Holy Father's recovery.

480
00:51:51,984 --> 00:51:53,860
We had an agreement!

481
00:51:55,196 --> 00:51:58,948
This meeting was to be
merely a formality.

482
00:51:59,033 --> 00:52:04,412
-Please sit down.
-I'd rather stand. Give me an answer.

483
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:10,084
The Immobiliare has its roots in the
European tradition. Please understand.

484
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:14,214
I understand.
Your tactics are despicable.

485
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:17,425
That's quite an indictment,
coming from a Corleone.

486
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:21,805
-Gentlemen, gentlemen!
-Remember you are in the Vatican.

487
00:52:25,726 --> 00:52:31,397
-What is it that you want?
-Yes, you will take control.

488
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:35,985
We'll gladly put you at the helm
of our little fleet,

489
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:40,406
but our ships must all sail
in the same direction.

490
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:47,580
Otherwise, who can say how long
your stay with us will last?

491
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:55,630
It's not personal. It's only business.
You should know, Godfather.

492
00:52:59,677 --> 00:53:01,010
Very well.

493
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:07,350
You want to do business with me?
I will do business with you.

494
00:53:08,394 --> 00:53:10,311
Vipers, all of them.

495
00:53:16,402 --> 00:53:19,487
-We're back with the Borgias!
-Uncle Michael...

496
00:53:19,572 --> 00:53:22,866
-Andrew!
-I heard you were here.

497
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:26,494
It's so nice to see you.
Vincent, it's so nice.

498
00:53:27,371 --> 00:53:30,748
What is this about the Borgias?
Those days are over.

499
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:38,214
-Recognize it?
-Yeah.

500
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:45,889
Genco Olive Oil. That's where our
grandfather started as a delivery boy.

501
00:53:45,973 --> 00:53:48,308
Three years later he owned it.

502
00:53:48,392 --> 00:53:50,643
-Only in America.
-That's it.

503
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:56,774
Vincenzo, where have you been hiding?
We need your help so badly.

504
00:53:56,859 --> 00:54:00,570
-What can I do for you?
-Get rid of Joe Zasa. He sells drugs...

505
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:05,742
Now that I'm an older woman,
I'm afraid to go out at night.

506
00:54:05,826 --> 00:54:08,202
Where should they be now?

507
00:54:08,287 --> 00:54:11,331
-Lou, what's going on?
-We're late.

508
00:54:13,459 --> 00:54:16,085
-Have I ever let you down?
-I trust you.

509
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:18,546
-Don't worry.
-Thank you.

510
00:54:18,631 --> 00:54:20,340
Enjoy yourselves.

511
00:54:27,056 --> 00:54:30,850
-What was that?
-The neighborhood's in trouble.

512
00:54:31,936 --> 00:54:34,729
-Do you keep an eye out for them?
-Yes.

513
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:37,440
-And for me?
-From now on.

514
00:54:38,651 --> 00:54:42,570
-I've missed you all this time.
-I missed you too, cousin.

515
00:54:42,696 --> 00:54:47,492
I missed growing up with my cousins.
I didn't even know you, but missed you.

516
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:53,373
Do you remember stories about
our fathers? The old days?

517
00:54:53,457 --> 00:54:55,875
Yeah, what do you want to know?

518
00:54:58,170 --> 00:55:03,508
-What was Sonny like?
-Well, he was the Prince of the City.

519
00:55:05,052 --> 00:55:08,721
He died before I was born,
but I've heard a lot about him.

520
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:13,935
-What about my father?
-He's a great man.

521
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:17,897
He's a hero. He saved the family.

522
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:21,609
-Vincent?
-What?

523
00:55:21,694 --> 00:55:23,987
Did he kill his own brother?

524
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:29,492
No.

525
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:33,746
So, it's all lies?

526
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:41,504
Just stories, sweetheart. Okay?

527
00:55:45,634 --> 00:55:46,843
Okay.

528
00:55:48,637 --> 00:55:50,263
I believe you.

529
00:55:51,432 --> 00:55:54,809
-I'm glad you're around.
-I'm glad you're here too.

530
00:55:59,732 --> 00:56:01,232
Cugina...

531
00:56:02,234 --> 00:56:03,651
Cous...

532
00:56:18,042 --> 00:56:21,711
I'd like to take Joey Zasa for a ride
in this and drop him.

533
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:23,963
Joey Zasa is nothing.

534
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:28,551
He's a small time enforcer.
He bluffs and threatens.

535
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:32,430
He's nothing.
You can see him coming a mile away.

536
00:56:33,432 --> 00:56:36,017
-We should kill him before he...
-No!

537
00:56:39,146 --> 00:56:43,316
Never hate your enemies.
It affects your judgment.

538
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:02,293
Nice to see you again, Mr. Corleone.

539
00:57:22,356 --> 00:57:24,774
Hey, girls. Let's go.

540
00:57:42,918 --> 00:57:47,296
We trusted you to manage
our money in the casinos.

541
00:57:47,381 --> 00:57:53,302
It's not even 20 years. You've sold the
casinos and made fortunes for all of us.

542
00:57:53,387 --> 00:57:55,555
Bravo, Don Corleone!

543
00:57:57,766 --> 00:57:59,225
Thank you.

544
00:57:59,977 --> 00:58:06,732
Friends, I have come here
because our business together is done.

545
00:58:08,569 --> 00:58:10,278
We have prospered,

546
00:58:10,362 --> 00:58:15,533
and now it is time for us to dissolve
the business relationship between us.

547
00:58:17,786 --> 00:58:19,328
That's it.

548
00:58:19,413 --> 00:58:22,665
But I do have a little surprise. Al?

549
00:58:25,586 --> 00:58:27,753
Your shares in the casinos.

550
00:58:28,463 --> 00:58:32,466
I thought I cut through all the red tape,
so you could get your money right away.

551
00:58:38,891 --> 00:58:41,225
50 million dollars!

552
00:58:41,310 --> 00:58:44,854
-Not everybody gets the same.
-Nothing for you...

553
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:49,942
-It depends on your investment.
-Michael, this is really generous!

554
00:58:50,986 --> 00:58:52,403
Wonderful!

555
00:58:55,490 --> 00:59:00,036
-Parisi, how much did you invest?
-I don't remember.

556
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:02,538
You're blessed.

557
00:59:07,502 --> 00:59:12,256
My family has done much of
the hard work, taken many risks.

558
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:17,678
All to make money
for the rest of the families.

559
00:59:20,057 --> 00:59:22,099
You all know Joey Zasa.

560
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:25,519
He is, I admit, an important man.

561
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:30,316
His picture is on the cover
of the New York Times magazine.

562
00:59:30,901 --> 00:59:34,946
He gets the Esquire Magazine award
for the best dressed gangster.

563
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:38,032
The newspapers praise him

564
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:42,662
because he hires Blacks,
which shows he has a good heart.

565
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:46,916
He is famous.

566
00:59:47,668 --> 00:59:53,839
Who knows? Maybe one day
he'll make all of you popular.

567
00:59:55,509 --> 00:59:56,634
It's true.

568
00:59:56,718 --> 01:00:02,431
I make more of a bella figura.
That is my nature.

569
01:00:02,516 --> 01:00:07,603
But I also want to make a move
into legitimate enterprises.

570
01:00:07,688 --> 01:00:10,356
I'd like a little pin from the Pope.

571
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:15,945
Sure, I take the Blacks
and the Spanish into my family,

572
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:19,573
because that's America.

573
01:00:20,325 --> 01:00:23,703
And you guarantee
that they don't deal drugs?

574
01:00:25,497 --> 01:00:30,126
I don't guarantee that. I guarantee
that I'll kill anybody who does.

575
01:00:34,798 --> 01:00:39,969
-Let me talk to him.
-Who can refuse Don Altobello?

576
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:42,722
-Joey, are you...
-No!

577
01:00:43,557 --> 01:00:48,894
I say to all of you, I have been
treated this day with no respect.

578
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:55,526
I've earned you all money.
I've made you rich and I asked for little.

579
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:59,447
Good. You will not give, so I'll take!

580
01:01:00,824 --> 01:01:03,326
As for Don Corleone,

581
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:09,415
he makes it very clear to me today
that he is my enemy.

582
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:15,588
You must choose between us.

583
01:01:20,177 --> 01:01:21,344
No, Joey!

584
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:25,681
Michael, we could reason together.

585
01:01:26,183 --> 01:01:27,558
No.

586
01:01:28,977 --> 01:01:32,938
Michael, please... let's agree.

587
01:01:33,607 --> 01:01:35,900
He doesn't know what he's...

588
01:01:35,984 --> 01:01:37,443
No, no.

589
01:01:42,449 --> 01:01:45,242
Michael, the news is everywhere.

590
01:01:46,078 --> 01:01:50,206
Everyone says that you
control Immobiliare.

591
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:55,378
Immobiliare is already laundering
money in Peru and Nassau.

592
01:01:56,630 --> 01:02:01,092
We've worked with you for 40 years.
We should wet our beaks a little.

593
01:02:01,176 --> 01:02:06,138
-We want to do business with you.
-That's right, we've been together...

594
01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:19,443
-It's a hit! Let's go!
-Let's get out of here! Move!

595
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:41,257
My coat! It's my lucky coat!

596
01:02:42,426 --> 01:02:44,260
It's my lucky coat!

597
01:02:50,434 --> 01:02:51,851
Stay behind me!

598
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:10,202
Mikey, this way!

599
01:03:18,545 --> 01:03:21,755
Zasa, you son-of-a-bitch...

600
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:44,487
Come on. We're out of here.

601
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:19,104
-You did good, Vincent.
-Grazie.

602
01:04:19,439 --> 01:04:22,691
The old Dons were pretty much
wiped out.

603
01:04:22,776 --> 01:04:26,111
The survivors made deals with Zasa.

604
01:04:27,239 --> 01:04:29,657
-Altobello?
-He survived.

605
01:04:29,783 --> 01:04:34,662
He's with his daughters in Staten Island.
He says he's going to retire in Sicily.

606
01:04:36,581 --> 01:04:41,126
Joey Zasa would never pull something
like this without the backing.

607
01:04:41,962 --> 01:04:47,675
He's just muscle. He doesn't have
the wit for that helicopter attack.

608
01:04:47,759 --> 01:04:52,096
He doesn't even have the ambition
to wipe out the whole Commission.

609
01:04:52,180 --> 01:04:54,974
I say we hit back and take Zasa out!

610
01:05:00,605 --> 01:05:03,566
Never let anyone know
what you're thinking.

611
01:05:11,324 --> 01:05:14,326
Let's get a message to Joey Zasa.

612
01:05:17,539 --> 01:05:19,873
I respect what he's done.

613
01:05:21,001 --> 01:05:23,919
The new overthrows the old. It's natural.

614
01:05:24,379 --> 01:05:27,006
How can you do business with this guy?

615
01:05:29,467 --> 01:05:33,470
I'm a businessman, first and foremost.
I want no further conflict.

616
01:05:33,597 --> 01:05:38,017
-Tell him that he can live or he can die.
-Vincent, will you shut up!

617
01:05:56,536 --> 01:05:58,078
That's it.

618
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:01,790
Joey Zasa...

619
01:06:02,542 --> 01:06:04,877
He can't be doing this alone.

620
01:06:08,673 --> 01:06:12,551
Just when I thought I was out,
they pull me back in.

621
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:26,940
Our true enemy has not yet
shown his face.

622
01:06:31,279 --> 01:06:32,613
Michael!

623
01:06:39,454 --> 01:06:43,040
-Has he had his medicine?
-I don't know what he took.

624
01:06:48,546 --> 01:06:50,798
-I've got my wind back.
-Call a doctor.

625
01:06:50,882 --> 01:06:52,841
-Run, run, run!
-Vincent!

626
01:06:52,926 --> 01:06:56,929
Run at thunder, girl! Thunder can't hurt!

627
01:06:57,055 --> 01:06:59,098
Harmless noise!

628
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:04,436
Bullshit! You deceitful old fuck!

629
01:07:05,313 --> 01:07:08,023
Altobello, you fuck!

630
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:14,697
Fredo!

631
01:07:38,388 --> 01:07:40,848
Oh, God! Dad!

632
01:07:43,476 --> 01:07:45,144
Excuse me.

633
01:07:45,687 --> 01:07:47,312
I'll call Kay.

634
01:07:58,032 --> 01:08:01,744
-Good evening, sir.
-Can we wait here? We'll be back soon.

635
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:14,381
Mr. Harrison, you said it was urgent.
Have you come to confess your sins?

636
01:08:15,008 --> 01:08:19,678
Michael Corleone has had a diabetic
stroke. I wanted you to know about it.

637
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:25,559
He's in a coma. I'm here to insist
the deal goes through in any event.

638
01:08:25,643 --> 01:08:28,061
The Pope has not much time left.

639
01:08:29,314 --> 01:08:32,983
So, as you, I am in a difficult position.

640
01:08:33,443 --> 01:08:36,653
We have to ratify this deal
as soon as possible.

641
01:08:37,572 --> 01:08:40,407
-We have an understanding.
-Good.

642
01:08:41,785 --> 01:08:45,370
-I'm going to the hospital.
-I'll pray for Mr. Corleone.

643
01:08:50,168 --> 01:08:53,962
-Our thoughts are with Mr. Corleone.
-Thank you, Father Jim.

644
01:08:56,549 --> 01:09:00,010
Everything will be out in the open
if Corleone dies.

645
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:03,764
Play for time, Keinszig.

646
01:09:04,557 --> 01:09:08,894
A habit born of
a long contemplation of eternity.

647
01:09:15,902 --> 01:09:19,780
-Forget about it, Vinnie.
-Why? It's a simple hit.

648
01:09:19,864 --> 01:09:25,786
I'd love to smack Joey Zasa and then
whack the fag. But it's impossible.

649
01:09:26,246 --> 01:09:31,708
He's always with people, in front of
TV cameras in his own neighborhood.

650
01:09:31,793 --> 01:09:34,878
-It's not impossible. It'll work for us.
-How?

651
01:09:35,547 --> 01:09:39,716
Do you think he's going to let
Uncle Michael survive? Would you?

652
01:09:40,635 --> 01:09:42,761
He may not survive anyway.

653
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:46,765
-How would you do it?
-I'd do it myself.

654
01:09:49,394 --> 01:09:50,644
Do it!

655
01:09:52,939 --> 01:09:55,858
-What would you need?
-A couple of guys.

656
01:10:26,931 --> 01:10:28,557
Hello, Michael.

657
01:10:31,811 --> 01:10:33,145
It's Kay.

658
01:10:38,443 --> 01:10:39,651
Kay...

659
01:10:42,030 --> 01:10:44,031
I never expected you.

660
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:47,159
No, I know.

661
01:10:49,621 --> 01:10:51,330
But I'm here.

662
01:10:55,376 --> 01:10:57,336
-I'm glad.
-You know...

663
01:11:00,757 --> 01:11:03,634
I've never seen you looking so helpless.

664
01:11:07,764 --> 01:11:09,848
It's not so bad, really.

665
01:11:11,893 --> 01:11:15,854
I feel... I'm getting wiser now.

666
01:11:16,439 --> 01:11:18,398
-Yeah.
-Oh, yeah.

667
01:11:19,651 --> 01:11:25,113
-The sicker you get, the wiser you get?
-When I'm dead, I'll be really smart.

668
01:11:26,950 --> 01:11:31,036
Michael... I want to thank you for Tony.

669
01:11:34,374 --> 01:11:38,293
He's doing really well.
He's gotten some very good notices,

670
01:11:38,795 --> 01:11:43,882
and he'll make his operatic debut
in Sicily, in Palermo this Easter, so...

671
01:11:45,927 --> 01:11:47,052
So, thank you.

672
01:11:48,888 --> 01:11:51,765
That's a real honor. In Sicily.

673
01:11:56,938 --> 01:11:59,898
I will be there. I won't miss that.

674
01:12:00,692 --> 01:12:02,526
I won't miss that.

675
01:12:08,908 --> 01:12:11,159
Mary, Tony...

676
01:12:12,662 --> 01:12:14,246
Go see Dad.

677
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:23,588
-Sweetheart!
-Everything's going to be all right.

678
01:12:24,424 --> 01:12:26,758
-Tony!
-How are you doing, Pop?

679
01:12:29,262 --> 01:12:32,347
Your mother told me what happened.

680
01:12:32,432 --> 01:12:37,853
-About Palermo? I hope you'll be there.
-Of course. Kiss me.

681
01:12:57,915 --> 01:13:02,294
-Cousin Vinnie?
-He's not here. Call his apartment.

682
01:13:04,338 --> 01:13:06,923
-It's your cousin Mary.
-Let her in.

683
01:13:11,596 --> 01:13:15,724
Hi, cous. I thought I'd drop by.
Is that okay?

684
01:13:15,808 --> 01:13:17,726
I'll get the guys.

685
01:13:19,604 --> 01:13:22,814
No, it's not okay.
You shouldn't have come, Mary.

686
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:26,651
Only a couple of minutes, okay?

687
01:13:28,112 --> 01:13:31,114
-You look beautiful, cous.
-Thanks.

688
01:13:34,035 --> 01:13:36,661
So this is your club, your hideout?

689
01:13:37,330 --> 01:13:39,998
-Yeah.
-I came here to check it out.

690
01:13:45,171 --> 01:13:49,132
It's so strange, just me
and Aunt Connie in the house.

691
01:13:49,217 --> 01:13:53,512
-I feel better when I'm with you.
-What's wrong, sweetheart?

692
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:56,890
-I'm scared about my father.
-Don't be.

693
01:13:57,016 --> 01:14:00,936
When they took him out of
the ambulance, I thought he was dead.

694
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:03,855
Everybody says he's going to be better.

695
01:14:05,691 --> 01:14:07,317
Don't worry.

696
01:14:07,902 --> 01:14:10,821
I remember a shooting when I was little.

697
01:14:11,864 --> 01:14:16,660
And one time Al Neri and other
bodyguards took me and Tony away.

698
01:14:18,621 --> 01:14:20,789
Is it all happening again?

699
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:24,292
Not like that, sweetie.

700
01:14:25,878 --> 01:14:29,714
Then why are you hiding here?
Is something going to happen to you?

701
01:14:31,717 --> 01:14:35,679
Nothing's going to happen
to me, cugina. We'll take care of you.

702
01:14:46,899 --> 01:14:51,236
-Can I stay here and hide out with you?
-Can you help me cook for the boys?

703
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:55,031
You know that I don't know
how to cook, but I'll help.

704
01:15:08,212 --> 01:15:09,462
Okay...

705
01:15:10,423 --> 01:15:11,923
What do I do?

706
01:15:44,290 --> 01:15:47,167
-I love you, cous.
-I love you, too, cous.

707
01:15:51,088 --> 01:15:52,631
Let us cook.

708
01:16:09,649 --> 01:16:10,982
Hold me.

709
01:16:47,853 --> 01:16:52,357
You in the press and the police
use words like "Mafia", "Cosa Nostra".

710
01:16:52,483 --> 01:16:57,988
This is a fantasy. We Italian-Americans
laid the bricks that built this city.

711
01:16:58,072 --> 01:17:00,907
We have Meucci,
who invented the telephone.

712
01:17:00,992 --> 01:17:04,911
We have Don Ameche,
who played the guy who invented it.

713
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:09,791
Buy yourself a raffle ticket,
maybe you'll win a Cadillac.

714
01:17:10,376 --> 01:17:12,752
The salsiccia is wonderful!

715
01:17:12,878 --> 01:17:14,796
Here, have a sandwich.

716
01:17:27,601 --> 01:17:30,729
-Nice to see you, Mr. Zasa.
-Have a nice time.

717
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:34,858
Don't forget to buy your raffle tickets.

718
01:17:38,237 --> 01:17:41,031
-What are you doing?
-He didn't mean it.

719
01:17:41,824 --> 01:17:44,659
-Tell him you're sorry.
-Okay, let's go.

720
01:18:03,554 --> 01:18:06,890
Joey! How are you?

721
01:18:06,974 --> 01:18:08,933
How are you, Buddy boy?

722
01:18:09,935 --> 01:18:12,937
Hey, Joey Zasa! Joey, up your ass!

723
01:18:15,024 --> 01:18:18,276
-Who is this? Do you know him?
-Ignore him.

724
01:18:19,236 --> 01:18:22,322
Who's going to win the car? The Ant?

725
01:18:23,407 --> 01:18:27,744
This is what gives Italian-Americans
a bad name. A cappone like this.

726
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:30,830
Joey, up your ass!

727
01:18:30,915 --> 01:18:34,376
Get off the car!
Do you have a raffle ticket?

728
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:37,295
Joey, take a look at my raffle ticket!

729
01:18:37,797 --> 01:18:42,092
Here's what I think of you...
and your raffle ticket.

730
01:18:42,635 --> 01:18:46,304
Get the fuck off this car.
I'll break your fucking balls.

731
01:18:49,141 --> 01:18:50,975
Get out of here!

732
01:19:06,450 --> 01:19:08,952
Run, Joey! You piece of shit!

733
01:19:21,924 --> 01:19:23,758
Open the door!

734
01:19:23,843 --> 01:19:25,635
How are you, Joe?

735
01:19:29,014 --> 01:19:30,223
Zasa!

736
01:19:47,658 --> 01:19:54,581
Don't ever again give that kind of order.
Not while I'm alive.

737
01:19:54,665 --> 01:19:56,040
Understand?

738
01:19:57,960 --> 01:20:04,174
You were too sick to make a decision.
I got a go-ahead from Neri and Connie.

739
01:20:05,217 --> 01:20:06,468
Connie?

740
01:20:16,270 --> 01:20:19,022
It was the right decision, Uncle Mike.

741
01:20:19,732 --> 01:20:23,568
It was the wrong decision.
I command this family!

742
01:20:24,069 --> 01:20:26,029
Right or wrong...

743
01:20:26,864 --> 01:20:29,574
...it was not what I wanted!

744
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:50,011
Do you understand?

745
01:20:56,936 --> 01:20:58,061
Yes.

746
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:06,653
Come on, Michael.

747
01:21:18,165 --> 01:21:19,541
Yes.

748
01:21:21,627 --> 01:21:27,507
Good. Vincent, help me to my bed.
I want to talk to you alone for a minute.

749
01:21:36,016 --> 01:21:39,602
You know,
I always felt responsible for you.

750
01:21:40,896 --> 01:21:42,564
You know that.

751
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:45,066
Your father...

752
01:21:46,193 --> 01:21:49,153
...my brother, we were opposites.

753
01:21:49,822 --> 01:21:54,075
We would fight and argue.
But I never doubted his love.

754
01:21:54,994 --> 01:21:59,205
He would do anything for me.
But his temper...

755
01:22:03,002 --> 01:22:06,796
Too much. It clouded his reason.

756
01:22:08,507 --> 01:22:11,175
I don't want you to make that mistake.

757
01:22:14,054 --> 01:22:15,305
Also...

758
01:22:16,348 --> 01:22:18,850
...he, too, had a way with women.

759
01:22:20,894 --> 01:22:23,438
-Vincent...
-So I hear.

760
01:22:23,522 --> 01:22:26,024
What are you doing with my daughter?

761
01:22:28,694 --> 01:22:31,029
What are you doing with her?

762
01:22:35,326 --> 01:22:37,243
It's too dangerous.

763
01:22:40,331 --> 01:22:42,040
Do you hear me?

764
01:22:48,130 --> 01:22:49,297
Okay.

765
01:23:03,646 --> 01:23:05,229
Vincenzo...

766
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:13,237
When they come,
they'll come at what you love.

767
01:23:21,872 --> 01:23:24,499
Michael, you must lead another life.

768
01:23:25,417 --> 01:23:30,004
You have everything a man
could desire. It's time for you to retire.

769
01:23:31,757 --> 01:23:34,217
I have too much responsibility.

770
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:41,182
Immobiliare? It's too difficult now.
You should really get out.

771
01:23:41,266 --> 01:23:45,853
What do you know
about those pezzi da novanta in Italy?

772
01:23:50,067 --> 01:23:53,403
I'm too old to know anything
about those new people.

773
01:23:53,821 --> 01:23:57,949
I must accept my age
and grow my olives and tomatoes.

774
01:23:59,785 --> 01:24:03,287
-We're not that old.
-But you're very ill.

775
01:24:04,498 --> 01:24:08,543
Michael... Let me see
what can be done.

776
01:24:09,670 --> 01:24:12,797
Let me work to make your path
a little easier.

777
01:24:14,174 --> 01:24:19,220
-Your friendship does that always.
-That makes me happy.

778
01:24:19,805 --> 01:24:23,933
Joey Zasa...
You were wrong about him.

779
01:24:25,269 --> 01:24:28,563
I trust too much.
That's always been my fault.

780
01:24:36,447 --> 01:24:39,949
Michael... treachery is everywhere.

781
01:24:40,534 --> 01:24:44,036
You still have your fingers
on the strings, even now.

782
01:24:46,206 --> 01:24:48,458
Let's see more of each other.

783
01:24:49,209 --> 01:24:53,546
-Michael, in Sicily?
-In Sicily.

784
01:24:54,506 --> 01:24:58,551
In Sicilia.

785
01:25:46,683 --> 01:25:48,100
How are you?

786
01:25:48,936 --> 01:25:51,771
Don Bendino, my old friend.

787
01:26:23,095 --> 01:26:28,307
I brought you here, so that my old friend
and protector, Don Tommasino,

788
01:26:28,809 --> 01:26:30,434
could advise us.

789
01:26:32,104 --> 01:26:35,439
What do you think about Altobello?

790
01:26:36,358 --> 01:26:39,110
A very talented man.

791
01:26:39,611 --> 01:26:43,573
He has kept the peace between our
Sicilian and American friends.

792
01:26:44,449 --> 01:26:46,784
The saint of reason.

793
01:26:48,829 --> 01:26:52,665
A blood bath in Atlantic City
left New York a mess.

794
01:26:53,834 --> 01:26:56,377
Joey Zasa at least was running
a tight ship,

795
01:26:56,461 --> 01:27:00,339
but with him out of the picture
we must step in.

796
01:27:00,424 --> 01:27:04,260
-Step back in...
-Or the Chinese and Colombians will.

797
01:27:04,970 --> 01:27:09,891
The Corleones left drugs, so New York
is weak, and Palermo is strong.

798
01:27:11,435 --> 01:27:15,479
Your enemies always get strong
on what you leave behind.

799
01:27:18,025 --> 01:27:22,528
Who could give the order
for that massacre...

800
01:27:24,406 --> 01:27:28,367
and still pressure the Vatican deal?

801
01:27:28,493 --> 01:27:33,706
Only Lucchesi can reach
between these two worlds.

802
01:27:35,918 --> 01:27:39,337
"Our ships must all sail
in the same direction"...

803
01:27:41,006 --> 01:27:46,886
Italian politics have had these men
for centuries. They are the true Mafia.

804
01:27:46,970 --> 01:27:50,139
The Archbishop and the Vatican Bank,
that's the big problem.

805
01:27:50,223 --> 01:27:54,226
They're the same problem.
B.J., they're connected.

806
01:27:55,354 --> 01:27:58,356
The Archbishop has powerful friends.

807
01:28:00,692 --> 01:28:02,318
They totally protect him.

808
01:28:02,527 --> 01:28:07,031
Is there someone in the
Church we can turn to?

809
01:28:07,157 --> 01:28:10,701
Someone we can tell
our problem to?

810
01:28:12,037 --> 01:28:14,038
Cardinal Lamberto.

811
01:28:14,247 --> 01:28:19,585
A wise and good man...
very influential.

812
01:28:20,045 --> 01:28:23,214
He will see you.

813
01:28:28,261 --> 01:28:33,849
I will see this Cardinal Lamberto
and see if we can work things out.

814
01:28:35,686 --> 01:28:40,064
You honor your agreements,
but you are dealing with crooks.

815
01:28:41,233 --> 01:28:43,234
They have no honor.

816
01:28:45,362 --> 01:28:47,029
My word is final.

817
01:28:58,208 --> 01:29:02,586
Politics and crime,
they're the same thing.

818
01:29:24,276 --> 01:29:30,948
I've invited you all here to celebrate
my son's debut in an opera house...

819
01:29:31,575 --> 01:29:33,284
We'll play "Philadelphia".

820
01:29:34,870 --> 01:29:39,081
Seven cards. Two down, four up.
Deuces and one-eyed jacks are wild.

821
01:29:39,166 --> 01:29:41,751
...in the opera "Cavallaria Rusticana".

822
01:29:41,835 --> 01:29:46,172
-It's "Cavalleria Rusticana," Dad.
-"Cavalleria."

823
01:29:46,298 --> 01:29:50,843
I think I have tickets to the wrong opera.
I've been in New York too long.

824
01:29:51,928 --> 01:29:55,264
You will all receive tickets,
so come on time.

825
01:29:55,348 --> 01:29:57,725
Dad, I've got a present for you.

826
01:30:01,646 --> 01:30:05,733
It comes from the town of Corleone
and it's authentic Sicilian.

827
01:30:06,943 --> 01:30:09,987
And... I learned it for you.

828
01:31:39,953 --> 01:31:45,166
She was wonderful, beautiful.
I loved her. And then she died.

829
01:31:46,751 --> 01:31:51,672
My trusted bodyguard
planted a bomb in my car.

830
01:31:53,425 --> 01:31:55,593
She drove it before I did.

831
01:31:57,137 --> 01:32:00,222
Why is such a beautiful country
so violent?

832
01:32:00,765 --> 01:32:02,391
History.

833
01:32:02,434 --> 01:32:06,896
Mom was telling me about when your
biggest worry was passing your exams.

834
01:32:07,105 --> 01:32:10,399
-Yes, it was then.
-I worry about you now.

835
01:32:11,026 --> 01:32:15,905
Oh, Mary, you're such a
warm-hearted girl. You always were.

836
01:32:16,448 --> 01:32:19,867
-I love my family.
-Even your cousin Vincent?

837
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:25,956
I really love him.

838
01:32:27,459 --> 01:32:30,628
-He's your first cousin.
-Then I love him first.

839
01:32:31,713 --> 01:32:34,298
Mary, you can't see him.

840
01:32:35,133 --> 01:32:37,343
Just don't see him anymore.

841
01:32:38,345 --> 01:32:41,472
He's right. It's too dangerous.

842
01:32:44,017 --> 01:32:46,977
Mary, you can't see him anymore.

843
01:32:47,437 --> 01:32:49,647
-Not in that fashion.
-No.

844
01:32:51,316 --> 01:32:54,652
-Please, promise me.
-No!

845
01:32:54,736 --> 01:32:57,154
-Obey me on this.
-No, Dad!

846
01:33:02,494 --> 01:33:06,497
Mary is smart, Dad.
She'll understand eventually.

847
01:33:29,729 --> 01:33:32,356
Bella cugina... Tesoro mio.

848
01:33:43,910 --> 01:33:46,203
-You wanted to see me?
-Yeah.

849
01:33:47,205 --> 01:33:50,457
I want you to do something for me.
It's dangerous.

850
01:33:52,294 --> 01:33:55,546
Good. I'm in. What do you need?

851
01:33:56,381 --> 01:33:59,466
I want you to sell your soul
to Don Altobello.

852
01:34:00,218 --> 01:34:01,885
To betray me.

853
01:34:05,307 --> 01:34:07,266
He'd never believe me.

854
01:34:08,393 --> 01:34:10,728
-That depends.
-Sit down.

855
01:34:13,648 --> 01:34:15,190
I have an idea.

856
01:34:16,901 --> 01:34:20,321
See if you can learn
how high Altobello is connected.

857
01:34:24,576 --> 01:34:26,368
Arrange a meeting.

858
01:34:29,039 --> 01:34:33,459
You say how devoted you are to me.
Tell him your problems.

859
01:34:34,794 --> 01:34:37,588
-Ask for his help.
-What problems?

860
01:34:39,591 --> 01:34:42,468
That you want to run away
with my daughter.

861
01:34:43,261 --> 01:34:46,805
But you know that if you do,
I will become your enemy.

862
01:34:52,020 --> 01:34:55,314
-You know that I would never do that.
-I know.

863
01:34:56,733 --> 01:35:01,111
Ask Altobello to speak to me.
To further the marriage.

864
01:35:01,905 --> 01:35:06,575
But you're cousins, after all. Michael
was always a little old-fashioned.

865
01:35:07,952 --> 01:35:12,831
Say you can't belong to my legitimate
world. That you want your own family.

866
01:35:13,625 --> 01:35:16,960
I could straighten out
what Joey Zasa left behind.

867
01:35:18,546 --> 01:35:21,507
If you could use your friendship
to persuade him,

868
01:35:22,550 --> 01:35:25,469
I would be indebted to you forever.

869
01:35:27,430 --> 01:35:31,058
A Corleone knows the value
of such a friend.

870
01:35:32,852 --> 01:35:35,312
Then you would work for me?

871
01:35:36,147 --> 01:35:37,356
Sì.

872
01:35:40,068 --> 01:35:42,736
Bacio la mano, Don Altobello.

873
01:35:45,824 --> 01:35:50,828
If he hints that he wants you
to betray me, get insulted,

874
01:35:51,454 --> 01:35:53,497
because that's his trap.

875
01:36:00,213 --> 01:36:03,382
You're not telling me
the whole truth, Vincenzo.

876
01:36:06,636 --> 01:36:12,307
Isn't it true, that with Michael gone,
the girl controls everything?

877
01:36:16,563 --> 01:36:20,232
-Leave the girl out of this.
-Of course, you love her.

878
01:36:20,316 --> 01:36:22,025
And she loves you.

879
01:36:42,797 --> 01:36:45,924
I guessed it, didn't I?

880
01:36:47,427 --> 01:36:52,264
You're a wise man, Don Altobello.
I'll be learning a lot from you.

881
01:36:53,349 --> 01:36:57,060
The richest man is the one
with the most powerful friends.

882
01:36:59,522 --> 01:37:02,274
It's my duty to make the introductions.

883
01:37:09,032 --> 01:37:11,116
Don Lucchesi.

884
01:37:13,745 --> 01:37:19,458
Don Altobello tells me that you have
a strong character. A man of respect.

885
01:37:19,542 --> 01:37:22,920
This is the hero who put
Joey Zasa in his grave.

886
01:37:23,421 --> 01:37:27,299
If we'd known of his existence,
we wouldn't have backed Joey.

887
01:37:27,717 --> 01:37:29,760
No one wants another Joe.

888
01:37:31,930 --> 01:37:34,056
Let me be your friend.

889
01:37:34,557 --> 01:37:38,685
-Even the strongest man needs friends.
-I'm flattered.

890
01:37:40,104 --> 01:37:44,608
You're a man of finance and politics.
Things I don't understand.

891
01:37:46,361 --> 01:37:50,280
You understand guns.
Finance is a gun.

892
01:37:51,449 --> 01:37:55,702
Politics is knowing
when to pull the trigger.

893
01:38:00,250 --> 01:38:01,875
How can I help?

894
01:38:02,627 --> 01:38:03,961
Vieni?

895
01:38:07,048 --> 01:38:12,302
Blessed is the peacemaker,
for he can be called the child of God.

896
01:38:12,679 --> 01:38:15,472
-Tu parli Italiano un poco?
-Sì.

897
01:38:37,829 --> 01:38:40,664
The wheelchair, for Don Tommasino.

898
01:38:48,590 --> 01:38:53,427
I trusted this business arrangement
with the Archbishop. I trusted him.

899
01:38:53,511 --> 01:38:56,680
I was sure his honesty
was beyond a doubt.

900
01:38:57,682 --> 01:39:01,893
But, as you see,
I'm now the victim of a swindle.

901
01:39:02,895 --> 01:39:08,525
He's stalling me. Vast monies have
gone to people in high political places

902
01:39:08,860 --> 01:39:11,778
and the Vatican Bank is the guarantor.

903
01:39:11,863 --> 01:39:17,075
If what you say is true,
there will be a great scandal.

904
01:39:19,245 --> 01:39:24,291
Look at this stone. It has been
in the water for a very long time,

905
01:39:24,375 --> 01:39:28,128
but the water has not penetrated it.

906
01:39:32,342 --> 01:39:33,634
Look...

907
01:39:34,719 --> 01:39:39,848
Perfectly dry. The same thing
has happened to men in Europe.

908
01:39:39,932 --> 01:39:44,061
For centuries they have been
surrounded by Christianity,

909
01:39:44,896 --> 01:39:50,776
but Christ has not penetrated.
Christ doesn't live within them.

910
01:39:54,906 --> 01:39:59,076
-What's happening?
-Could you get me something sweet?

911
01:39:59,160 --> 01:40:02,496
Some orange juice, candy...

912
01:40:06,250 --> 01:40:08,502
I have trouble with diabetes.

913
01:40:12,215 --> 01:40:14,508
My blood sugar goes low.

914
01:40:14,592 --> 01:40:16,426
I understand.

915
01:40:39,701 --> 01:40:42,619
It happens sometimes
when I'm under stress.

916
01:40:43,496 --> 01:40:45,122
I understand.

917
01:40:47,208 --> 01:40:50,919
To come to you
on such a delicate matter...

918
01:40:53,798 --> 01:40:58,343
Accusations against your Archbishop.
It was difficult for me.

919
01:41:00,138 --> 01:41:01,847
The mind suffers

920
01:41:02,348 --> 01:41:05,142
and the body cries out.

921
01:41:11,315 --> 01:41:12,816
That's true.

922
01:41:14,485 --> 01:41:18,280
Would you like to make
your confession?

923
01:41:25,037 --> 01:41:26,913
Your Eminence, I'm...

924
01:41:31,252 --> 01:41:36,673
It's been so long. I wouldn't...
I wouldn't know where to...

925
01:41:38,217 --> 01:41:40,093
It's been 30 years.

926
01:41:41,971 --> 01:41:44,681
I'd use up too much of your time, I think.

927
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:48,185
I always have time to save souls.

928
01:41:49,771 --> 01:41:54,399
-Well, I'm beyond redemption.
-No, no...

929
01:42:03,743 --> 01:42:07,496
I hear the confessions
of my own priests here.

930
01:42:08,831 --> 01:42:12,375
Sometimes the desire to confess
is overwhelming,

931
01:42:13,044 --> 01:42:15,420
and we must seize the moment.

932
01:42:20,092 --> 01:42:23,762
What is the point of confessing
if I don't repent?

933
01:42:26,349 --> 01:42:28,725
I hear you are a practical man.

934
01:42:29,685 --> 01:42:31,728
What have you got to lose?

935
01:42:43,574 --> 01:42:44,950
Go on.

936
01:42:51,749 --> 01:42:52,916
I...

937
01:42:54,335 --> 01:42:56,127
...betrayed my wife.

938
01:42:57,922 --> 01:42:59,506
Go on, my son.

939
01:43:05,179 --> 01:43:06,930
I betrayed myself.

940
01:43:09,976 --> 01:43:11,518
I killed men.

941
01:43:15,606 --> 01:43:18,066
And I ordered men to be killed.

942
01:43:19,610 --> 01:43:21,653
Go on, my son. Go on.

943
01:43:27,785 --> 01:43:29,369
It's useless.

944
01:43:30,955 --> 01:43:32,622
Go on, my son.

945
01:43:34,083 --> 01:43:35,542
I killed...

946
01:43:40,631 --> 01:43:43,133
I ordered the death of my brother.

947
01:43:44,302 --> 01:43:46,094
He injured me.

948
01:43:47,722 --> 01:43:49,806
I killed my mother's son.

949
01:43:51,642 --> 01:43:53,685
I killed my father's son.

950
01:44:04,447 --> 01:44:08,825
Your sins are terrible,
and it is just that you suffer.

951
01:44:10,453 --> 01:44:12,829
Your life could be redeemed,

952
01:44:14,248 --> 01:44:18,084
but I know that you don't believe that.
You will not change.

953
01:44:48,741 --> 01:44:53,703
Pope Paul VI, Supreme Pontiff
of the Roman Catholic Church,...

954
01:44:54,038 --> 01:44:57,207
died last night at 9:40 p.m.

955
01:44:57,708 --> 01:45:01,044
The Pope was 81 years old,...

956
01:45:01,879 --> 01:45:05,465
and had been in poor health
for the last several months.

957
01:45:10,346 --> 01:45:11,721
Connie...

958
01:45:13,557 --> 01:45:17,936
All my life I've kept trying
to go up in society.

959
01:45:18,646 --> 01:45:21,564
To where everything higher up
was legal, straight...

960
01:45:23,651 --> 01:45:27,112
But the higher I go,
the more crooked it becomes.

961
01:45:29,907 --> 01:45:32,075
Where the hell does it end?

962
01:45:41,085 --> 01:45:44,504
They've been killing each other
for centuries here.

963
01:45:45,923 --> 01:45:50,010
For money, for pride, for family.

964
01:45:53,222 --> 01:45:57,225
To keep from becoming the slaves
of the rich pezzi da novanta.

965
01:46:04,316 --> 01:46:06,568
I made confession, Connie.

966
01:46:07,570 --> 01:46:09,612
I confessed my sins.

967
01:46:11,282 --> 01:46:16,369
Why? That's not like you. You don't
have to confess your sins to a stranger.

968
01:46:17,288 --> 01:46:18,872
It was the man.

969
01:46:19,915 --> 01:46:23,626
He's a good man. A true priest.

970
01:46:27,798 --> 01:46:29,841
He can change things.

971
01:46:32,094 --> 01:46:33,803
Michael...

972
01:46:35,306 --> 01:46:39,184
You know,
sometimes I think of poor Fredo.

973
01:46:40,019 --> 01:46:43,313
Drowned. It was God's will.

974
01:46:45,858 --> 01:46:48,068
It was a terrible accident.

975
01:46:49,487 --> 01:46:51,446
But it's finished.

976
01:46:56,494 --> 01:46:58,328
Michael, I love you.

977
01:47:00,706 --> 01:47:02,665
I'll always help you.

978
01:47:14,929 --> 01:47:16,471
Oh, Connie...

979
01:47:46,377 --> 01:47:53,383
I am honored, Don Altobello, that
you've come from Palermo to visit me.

980
01:47:56,720 --> 01:48:01,724
Hey, the little kid! He's grown.

981
01:48:02,351 --> 01:48:04,185
Do the donkey for me.

982
01:48:21,745 --> 01:48:25,832
It's been some time since we
did business together.

983
01:48:29,795 --> 01:48:34,799
You are my "ace in the hole,"
as we say in America.

984
01:48:34,884 --> 01:48:40,763
I have a stone in my shoe.
You can remove it.

985
01:48:48,022 --> 01:48:50,940
Only one stone?

986
01:48:52,943 --> 01:48:58,907
It's dangerous. A famous man.

987
01:48:59,158 --> 01:49:02,660
You will have to take precautions.

988
01:49:05,456 --> 01:49:10,960
Tell me what to do.
Then I will tell you my price.

989
01:49:15,174 --> 01:49:17,967
Ah, what bread!

990
01:49:21,972 --> 01:49:26,142
Olive oil...

991
01:49:29,313 --> 01:49:32,815
Virgin... only in Sicily.

992
01:49:35,277 --> 01:49:36,527
Alla salute!

993
01:49:36,612 --> 01:49:39,489
To death.

994
01:49:53,003 --> 01:49:54,587
Kay!

995
01:49:54,672 --> 01:49:57,006
-Connie!
-How are you?

996
01:49:57,091 --> 01:50:00,176
Mary, I've missed you.

997
01:50:00,678 --> 01:50:04,389
-Hello, Michael.
-Mom, look at this.

998
01:50:08,477 --> 01:50:14,399
-It's too bad Douglas couldn't come.
-I know. He had a very important trial.

999
01:50:14,483 --> 01:50:16,526
I know he wanted to come.

1000
01:50:17,695 --> 01:50:19,696
-The car is...
-Okay.

1001
01:50:21,699 --> 01:50:27,870
-Well, your son is an artist.
-Oh, yes. Thanks to you.

1002
01:50:28,539 --> 01:50:32,875
-What for?
-For making me let him go.

1003
01:50:33,544 --> 01:50:38,589
Well, after all these years,
here I am in Sicily for the first time.

1004
01:50:38,716 --> 01:50:41,884
-I want to get a picture of you together.
-Okay.

1005
01:50:43,804 --> 01:50:45,555
Hey, Dad. Smile!

1006
01:50:50,060 --> 01:50:52,937
I see you still have Al Neri. Why?

1007
01:50:54,231 --> 01:50:57,817
I need him. He helps me
get in and out of the car.

1008
01:50:58,986 --> 01:51:02,739
-He carries my briefcase.
-You're still a liar, Michael.

1009
01:51:03,991 --> 01:51:09,245
Let me show you Sicily, the real Sicily.
So you'll understand the family history.

1010
01:51:10,331 --> 01:51:13,166
I think I understand
it well enough.

1011
01:52:04,802 --> 01:52:10,765
Anthony, I have something you made
for me a very long time ago.

1012
01:52:12,476 --> 01:52:15,269
-Might bring you luck.
-Thanks.

1013
01:52:19,483 --> 01:52:22,735
You saved it... I remember.

1014
01:52:26,740 --> 01:52:28,324
Thank you, Dad.

1015
01:52:29,910 --> 01:52:31,661
I'm proud of you.

1016
01:52:32,413 --> 01:52:33,955
Thank you.

1017
01:52:50,264 --> 01:52:53,057
-Are they as good as they look?
-Better.

1018
01:52:53,142 --> 01:52:57,562
They're the best. As long as they are
around, Uncle Michael is safe.

1019
01:52:58,230 --> 01:52:59,856
Goodbye.

1020
01:53:02,443 --> 01:53:05,653
-Tell your father I'll be back for dinner.
-Okay.

1021
01:53:06,155 --> 01:53:08,781
-Have fun.
-Tell Tony to wait for me.

1022
01:53:08,866 --> 01:53:10,324
I will.

1023
01:53:12,828 --> 01:53:16,414
Buongiorno, signora. At your service.

1024
01:53:20,377 --> 01:53:23,254
If I see Dad, I'll tell him you left.

1025
01:53:28,760 --> 01:53:32,430
You're the only one left
with my father's strength.

1026
01:53:34,683 --> 01:53:38,561
If anything happens to Michael,
I want you to strike back.

1027
01:53:41,523 --> 01:53:43,691
I'll have everything ready.

1028
01:53:47,112 --> 01:53:48,863
Do you swear?

1029
01:53:56,163 --> 01:53:57,747
I swear to you.

1030
01:54:28,195 --> 01:54:29,862
Here it is.

1031
01:54:31,657 --> 01:54:34,283
The house where my father was born.

1032
01:54:35,369 --> 01:54:40,790
This is where they came to take him
when he was a boy. To kill him.

1033
01:54:44,169 --> 01:54:45,962
Wait...

1034
01:54:46,463 --> 01:54:48,381
Listen to that.

1035
01:55:07,568 --> 01:55:09,569
You know Mary's in love.

1036
01:55:11,071 --> 01:55:12,697
Yes, I know.

1037
01:55:13,907 --> 01:55:17,743
With a handsome young Italian man
with dark eyes...

1038
01:55:19,204 --> 01:55:21,038
I won't allow it.

1039
01:55:23,834 --> 01:55:27,461
It's wrong.
It's wrong and it's dangerous.

1040
01:55:27,671 --> 01:55:30,673
"Oh father, my father!"

1041
01:55:31,341 --> 01:55:33,718
"Give me some time to pray
to the Lord."

1042
01:55:34,845 --> 01:55:37,930
The Baroness of Carini had
betrayed her husband...

1043
01:55:38,515 --> 01:55:41,309
and fallen in love with her cousin.

1044
01:55:41,685 --> 01:55:43,686
"There will be no forgiveness!"

1045
01:55:43,770 --> 01:55:47,356
Her father stabbed her through
the heart.

1046
01:55:59,870 --> 01:56:01,370
Honor, huh?

1047
01:56:21,016 --> 01:56:23,976
I remember the time you came
to my parents' house

1048
01:56:24,061 --> 01:56:27,647
and told me about the family business.

1049
01:56:27,731 --> 01:56:32,735
How you'd never have anything
to do with it. You sounded like Tony.

1050
01:56:33,820 --> 01:56:35,821
I was a lot like Tony.

1051
01:56:43,413 --> 01:56:46,290
-I can barely see him... Kay?
-What?

1052
01:56:46,375 --> 01:56:49,043
-Do you mind driving?
-What's wrong?

1053
01:56:49,127 --> 01:56:52,088
My eyes.
Sometimes they're all right, but...

1054
01:56:53,840 --> 01:56:56,175
I have to see Don Tommasino...

1055
01:56:59,846 --> 01:57:01,263
Well...

1056
01:57:02,516 --> 01:57:05,935
-There are no bodyguards today.
-I really snuck away.

1057
01:57:13,110 --> 01:57:17,488
Father, where are you going?
Would you like a ride?

1058
01:57:26,623 --> 01:57:30,876
I know you. You're Mosca
of Montelepre.

1059
01:57:32,003 --> 01:57:35,840
You were an assassin then
and you're an assassin now.

1060
01:57:36,133 --> 01:57:39,468
I know Michael Corleone
is at your house.

1061
01:57:39,803 --> 01:57:42,054
I will pass through the gates
with you.

1062
01:57:59,030 --> 01:58:00,823
How are you?

1063
01:58:00,907 --> 01:58:04,493
This is Calo, one of my bodyguards
in the old days.

1064
01:58:10,333 --> 01:58:12,918
-We can wait here.
-You want a drink?

1065
01:58:18,341 --> 01:58:21,218
I spent a lot of time in this room...

1066
01:58:22,345 --> 01:58:24,346
...thinking of you.

1067
01:58:27,350 --> 01:58:29,518
And then you got married.

1068
01:58:33,106 --> 01:58:36,525
-I still thought of you.
-What's in that room?

1069
01:58:41,323 --> 01:58:44,867
This is dangerous for you. This is Sicily.

1070
01:58:47,954 --> 01:58:50,372
-I love this country.
-Why?

1071
01:58:52,876 --> 01:58:58,881
Well, all through history, terrible things
have happened to these people.

1072
01:58:59,883 --> 01:59:02,092
Terrible injustices.

1073
01:59:02,969 --> 01:59:07,848
But they still expect good,
rather than bad, will happen to them.

1074
01:59:08,391 --> 01:59:10,726
Sort of like me and you?

1075
01:59:14,606 --> 01:59:17,274
-How so?
-I'm still here, right?

1076
01:59:18,235 --> 01:59:21,320
We do have a bad history,
but I'm still here.

1077
01:59:21,404 --> 01:59:24,114
Yes, you are, but with dread.

1078
01:59:29,037 --> 01:59:30,788
Give me the order!

1079
01:59:31,248 --> 01:59:34,375
Is that supposed to make me
not dread you?

1080
01:59:36,586 --> 01:59:38,838
We're in Sicily. It's opera.

1081
01:59:41,424 --> 01:59:42,883
Okay.

1082
01:59:45,512 --> 01:59:47,263
What do we do now?

1083
01:59:50,016 --> 01:59:53,894
Be reasonable.
Let's try not to hurt each other.

1084
02:00:01,778 --> 02:00:03,779
I want you to forgive me.

1085
02:00:06,616 --> 02:00:09,535
-For what?
-Everything.

1086
02:00:13,248 --> 02:00:15,374
Oh, like God?

1087
02:00:17,252 --> 02:00:19,879
No, I need something a little closer.

1088
02:00:22,799 --> 02:00:25,968
You couldn't understand,
back in those days.

1089
02:00:27,429 --> 02:00:32,308
I loved my father. I swore I would
never be a man like him,

1090
02:00:32,392 --> 02:00:36,186
but I loved him and he was in danger.
What could I do?

1091
02:00:36,855 --> 02:00:39,607
And then later, you were in danger.

1092
02:00:40,483 --> 02:00:43,819
Our children were in danger.
What could I do?

1093
02:00:44,863 --> 02:00:50,117
You were all that I... loved and valued
most in the world.

1094
02:00:52,537 --> 02:00:55,122
Now I'm losing you. I lost you.

1095
02:00:55,874 --> 02:00:57,708
You're gone.

1096
02:00:58,960 --> 02:01:01,754
And it was all for nothing. So...

1097
02:01:06,468 --> 02:01:11,513
You have to understand,
I had a whole different destiny planned.

1098
02:01:15,101 --> 02:01:16,977
All right, I'll stop.

1099
02:01:27,489 --> 02:01:31,408
I really don't know what you
want from me, Michael.

1100
02:01:31,868 --> 02:01:36,038
-I mean...
-I'm not the man that you think I am.

1101
02:01:37,874 --> 02:01:41,210
-I don't know.
-I love you, Kay.

1102
02:01:43,254 --> 02:01:45,214
Don't dread me anymore.

1103
02:01:50,971 --> 02:01:54,890
You know, every night here in Sicily...

1104
02:01:57,060 --> 02:02:02,022
...I dream about my wife
and my children...

1105
02:02:05,527 --> 02:02:07,486
...and how I lost them.

1106
02:02:09,739 --> 02:02:15,411
I guess that if it's any consolation,
I want you to know that...

1107
02:02:18,915 --> 02:02:20,332
...that...

1108
02:02:21,418 --> 02:02:23,752
...I always loved you, Michael.

1109
02:02:25,255 --> 02:02:26,964
And you know...

1110
02:02:28,800 --> 02:02:31,176
...always, I always will.

1111
02:02:59,789 --> 02:03:02,124
What is it? What's wrong?

1112
02:03:02,333 --> 02:03:05,127
They found Don Tommasino shot.

1113
02:03:06,463 --> 02:03:08,672
Is he dead?

1114
02:03:10,425 --> 02:03:13,969
My master is dead.
Blood calls for blood.

1115
02:03:14,596 --> 02:03:17,431
I must have revenge!

1116
02:03:21,227 --> 02:03:26,440
Some day, you may have to do
a difficult service for me.

1117
02:03:26,649 --> 02:03:28,233
Command me.

1118
02:03:30,153 --> 02:03:31,236
It never ends.

1119
02:03:31,321 --> 02:03:33,530
I will avenge him!

1120
02:03:48,713 --> 02:03:50,172
Totals...

1121
02:03:52,175 --> 02:03:54,551
Lorscheider, 1 vote.

1122
02:03:55,220 --> 02:03:58,263
Siri, 11 votes.

1123
02:03:58,932 --> 02:04:02,017
Lamberto, 99 votes.

1124
02:04:07,524 --> 02:04:12,861
Do you accept your election
as supreme pontiff?

1125
02:04:13,488 --> 02:04:19,243
Oh God, shed light on the decision
they have taken on my behalf.

1126
02:04:20,120 --> 02:04:21,829
I accept.

1127
02:04:21,996 --> 02:04:24,623
By what name do you
wish to be called?

1128
02:04:24,916 --> 02:04:27,918
John Paul the First.

1129
02:04:57,574 --> 02:05:02,452
I will do things "right away,"
rather than in "a little while"...

1130
02:05:04,581 --> 02:05:09,877
Frederick Keinszig, known as "God's
Banker”, has been reported missing.

1131
02:05:09,961 --> 02:05:16,717
He was last seen leaving the Rome
offices of Vatican owned Immobiliare.

1132
02:05:17,552 --> 02:05:21,013
Also missing was a large sum
of money and several documents.

1133
02:05:22,515 --> 02:05:24,600
Keinszig, you fool.

1134
02:05:28,104 --> 02:05:33,025
His absence casts further suspicion
on the dealings of the Vatican Bank.

1135
02:05:33,109 --> 02:05:35,819
For several years,
the bank and its companies

1136
02:05:35,904 --> 02:05:40,157
have been the object of allegations
of disreputable business practices.

1137
02:05:41,367 --> 02:05:45,495
Lucchesi, will you please
try to understand?

1138
02:05:46,956 --> 02:05:51,210
I have phoned him.
I have waited here by the phone.

1139
02:05:53,838 --> 02:05:57,382
You would do well to remember,
Mr. Lucchesi,

1140
02:05:58,259 --> 02:06:04,932
that this Pope has very different ideas
from the last one.

1141
02:06:27,163 --> 02:06:29,164
Goodbye, my old friend.

1142
02:06:31,876 --> 02:06:34,628
You could have lived a little longer.

1143
02:06:35,505 --> 02:06:38,006
I could be closer to my dream.

1144
02:06:44,347 --> 02:06:46,890
You were so loved, Don Tommasino.

1145
02:06:51,729 --> 02:06:55,440
Why was I so feared, and you so loved?

1146
02:06:56,693 --> 02:06:58,277
What was it?

1147
02:06:59,487 --> 02:07:01,697
I was no less honorable.

1148
02:07:03,783 --> 02:07:05,617
I wanted to do good.

1149
02:07:09,747 --> 02:07:12,708
What betrayed me? My mind? My heart?

1150
02:07:15,753 --> 02:07:18,213
Why do I condemn myself so?

1151
02:07:24,762 --> 02:07:26,513
I swear,

1152
02:07:26,931 --> 02:07:29,224
on the lives of my children...

1153
02:07:33,730 --> 02:07:36,398
Give me a chance to redeem myself...

1154
02:07:40,403 --> 02:07:44,031
...and I will sin no more.

1155
02:08:08,264 --> 02:08:12,142
You look pale. Bad news?
Tell me right away.

1156
02:08:14,270 --> 02:08:16,772
It's not just a bad banking deal.

1157
02:08:17,774 --> 02:08:19,900
These guys are butchers.

1158
02:08:21,110 --> 02:08:23,779
-What guys?
-Lucchesi.

1159
02:08:25,615 --> 02:08:29,451
He controls all of them:
Altobello, the Archbishop...

1160
02:08:31,287 --> 02:08:33,914
...others higher up, P2 maybe.

1161
02:08:33,998 --> 02:08:37,084
Secret unknown. They're running things.

1162
02:08:40,838 --> 02:08:45,634
-I'm in their way.
-He's hired an assassin to kill you.

1163
02:08:46,302 --> 02:08:48,929
A Sicilian. I don't know his name.

1164
02:08:51,057 --> 02:08:53,225
But they say he never fails.

1165
02:08:54,477 --> 02:08:56,645
Then no one is safe.

1166
02:08:59,482 --> 02:09:01,817
Even the new Pope is in danger.

1167
02:09:02,902 --> 02:09:05,987
We still have time. We can prevent this.

1168
02:09:11,411 --> 02:09:13,745
I tried, Vincent.

1169
02:09:15,915 --> 02:09:17,416
I tried...

1170
02:09:18,751 --> 02:09:23,171
...to keep everything from coming
to this. But it's not possible.

1171
02:09:24,715 --> 02:09:26,508
Not in this world.

1172
02:09:28,094 --> 02:09:29,845
Give me the order.

1173
02:09:33,683 --> 02:09:36,017
You won't be able to go back.

1174
02:09:37,061 --> 02:09:39,187
-You'll be like me.
-Good.

1175
02:09:40,940 --> 02:09:42,983
All my life I wanted out.

1176
02:09:43,693 --> 02:09:45,694
I wanted the family out.

1177
02:09:47,864 --> 02:09:49,698
I don't want out.

1178
02:09:50,158 --> 02:09:52,909
I want the power to preserve the family.

1179
02:09:57,623 --> 02:09:59,875
I'm asking for the order.

1180
02:10:20,813 --> 02:10:22,439
It's done.

1181
02:10:23,900 --> 02:10:26,234
Because I can't do it anymore.

1182
02:10:30,448 --> 02:10:34,034
Well, it doesn't matter.
Vincent knows what to do.

1183
02:10:34,118 --> 02:10:39,122
Come on outside.
Take a rest and don't think about it.

1184
02:10:39,499 --> 02:10:42,417
-All I do is think about it.
-I'm your son.

1185
02:10:43,586 --> 02:10:45,712
Command me in all things.

1186
02:10:48,049 --> 02:10:49,925
Give up my daughter.

1187
02:10:53,012 --> 02:10:55,180
That's the price you pay...

1188
02:10:56,307 --> 02:10:58,433
...for the life you choose.

1189
02:11:24,669 --> 02:11:26,253
Nephew...

1190
02:11:28,673 --> 02:11:30,757
...from this moment on...

1191
02:11:32,134 --> 02:11:34,636
...call yourself Vincent Corleone.

1192
02:11:39,475 --> 02:11:40,684
Sit.

1193
02:11:55,908 --> 02:11:57,492
Don Vincenzo...

1194
02:12:03,499 --> 02:12:05,208
Don Corleone...

1195
02:12:08,713 --> 02:12:10,839
Don Vincenzo Corleone...

1196
02:13:44,642 --> 02:13:47,018
E tu, Vincenzo...

1197
02:13:47,103 --> 02:13:51,731
I know how you feel about Michael,
but you can't save him.

1198
02:13:52,608 --> 02:13:54,025
He's lost.

1199
02:13:55,695 --> 02:13:57,570
Think of yourself.

1200
02:13:58,531 --> 02:14:01,282
What's your answer, Vincent?

1201
02:14:02,785 --> 02:14:04,536
Enjoy the opera.

1202
02:14:06,622 --> 02:14:08,623
It's all taken care of.

1203
02:14:14,255 --> 02:14:17,048
Check the bar. I'll check the top floor.

1204
02:14:20,886 --> 02:14:25,223
"Here's hoping Tony sings better at the
Teatro Massimo than in the shower.

1205
02:14:25,307 --> 02:14:27,559
"Love, Douglas."

1206
02:14:27,643 --> 02:14:31,062
-My darling Constanza!
-Don Altobello.

1207
02:14:31,981 --> 02:14:35,024
-This is a great occasion.
-Come, sit down.

1208
02:14:39,697 --> 02:14:44,117
Happy birthday.
You're 80, but don't look more than 60.

1209
02:14:44,201 --> 02:14:46,703
You're the only one who remembered.

1210
02:14:46,787 --> 02:14:48,455
We've just got the word.

1211
02:14:48,539 --> 02:14:51,958
The Pope has ratified
the Immobiliare deal. We've won.

1212
02:14:52,042 --> 02:14:53,752
Congratulations.

1213
02:14:56,589 --> 02:14:58,840
Strange how things work.

1214
02:14:58,924 --> 02:15:03,011
The Pope is doing what you
said he'd do. He's cleaning house.

1215
02:15:04,096 --> 02:15:07,891
He should be careful.
It's dangerous to be an honest man.

1216
02:15:14,148 --> 02:15:17,233
I want to put more muscle backstage
with Tony.

1217
02:15:29,288 --> 02:15:32,540
On your birthday you used to
shower me with treats.

1218
02:15:32,625 --> 02:15:34,501
Tootsie Rolls!

1219
02:15:35,377 --> 02:15:40,840
The nuns who made this cannoli took a
vow of silence. They're the very finest.

1220
02:15:44,678 --> 02:15:47,430
-Hey.
-Hey, cous.

1221
02:15:49,475 --> 02:15:52,227
Hi. Where's your leather?

1222
02:15:56,398 --> 02:15:57,941
Stop it.

1223
02:16:03,906 --> 02:16:07,116
You're so thin. You eat it.

1224
02:16:23,801 --> 02:16:25,134
È buono.

1225
02:16:25,678 --> 02:16:27,929
Grazie!

1226
02:16:30,891 --> 02:16:35,186
It's over. There are things I have to do
that you can't be part of.

1227
02:16:35,271 --> 02:16:38,189
It's not your father's decision, it's mine.

1228
02:16:40,109 --> 02:16:42,193
Don't hate your father.

1229
02:16:44,446 --> 02:16:48,283
There are things I'll be part of
that you can't be around.

1230
02:16:50,035 --> 02:16:52,787
After tonight,
you won't see me anymore.

1231
02:16:57,126 --> 02:17:00,795
You've got to understand, Mary.
You've got to understand.

1232
02:17:01,797 --> 02:17:03,464
I'll always love you.

1233
02:17:16,645 --> 02:17:18,479
Love somebody else.

1234
02:20:59,660 --> 02:21:03,621
-They won't try anything.
-Everything's fine. It's all clear.

1235
02:21:03,705 --> 02:21:06,541
I've already sent Al Neri to the Vatican.

1236
02:21:19,012 --> 02:21:21,556
Mr. Lucchesi's house?

1237
02:21:21,640 --> 02:21:22,640
Yes.

1238
02:21:23,142 --> 02:21:27,353
I bring a message from
Michael Corleone.

1239
02:21:28,730 --> 02:21:30,148
Let him in.

1240
02:22:59,279 --> 02:23:01,155
Buona sera.

1241
02:26:22,232 --> 02:26:24,108
Good. You got him.

1242
02:27:16,369 --> 02:27:19,788
Tonight the Corleone family
settles its accounts.

1243
02:27:20,123 --> 02:27:24,668
Keinszig...
That little Swiss banker fuck.

1244
02:27:25,921 --> 02:27:29,715
He's been swindling everyone
from the beginning. Fuck him.

1245
02:27:31,510 --> 02:27:34,136
Don Lucchesi, my friend.

1246
02:27:34,221 --> 02:27:36,889
Calo will pay him a visit at his home.

1247
02:27:39,559 --> 02:27:42,978
Neri, take a train to Rome.

1248
02:27:44,439 --> 02:27:46,982
Light a candle for the Archbishop.

1249
02:28:21,393 --> 02:28:24,853
Tea, Your Holiness? It will help
you sleep.

1250
02:28:48,503 --> 02:28:51,505
This is from Vincent Corleone.

1251
02:29:49,689 --> 02:29:54,652
It's serious. Our man inside the Vatican
says there's a plot against the Pope.

1252
02:29:54,736 --> 02:29:56,904
He'll have a heart attack?

1253
02:30:04,079 --> 02:30:09,291
This Pope has powerful enemies.
We may not be in time to save him.

1254
02:30:12,253 --> 02:30:13,837
Let's go back.

1255
02:30:48,415 --> 02:30:50,040
Eminenza...

1256
02:31:05,724 --> 02:31:08,350
The Holy Father is dead!

1257
02:32:38,858 --> 02:32:40,317
Sleep.

1258
02:32:41,152 --> 02:32:42,903
Sleep, Godfather.

1259
02:32:58,545 --> 02:33:00,212
Our friend's dead.

1260
02:33:53,057 --> 02:33:55,142
Speak...tell me.

1261
02:33:56,561 --> 02:34:02,983
You have lost the
faith of the people.

1262
02:34:04,277 --> 02:34:08,780
He who builds on the people
builds on mud.

1263
02:34:09,157 --> 02:34:12,993
And Michael Corleone's message?

1264
02:34:29,761 --> 02:34:36,266
It's very important.
I must whisper it in your ear.

1265
02:34:40,063 --> 02:34:42,064
He's clean.

1266
02:35:00,541 --> 02:35:03,335
Power wears out those
who don't have it.

1267
02:36:32,050 --> 02:36:35,385
-I like this outfit.
-I figured you would.

1268
02:36:35,470 --> 02:36:37,137
Say hello.

1269
02:36:59,160 --> 02:37:03,080
-Can I talk to you now?
-No, it's not a good time.

1270
02:37:03,164 --> 02:37:06,958
-You're just like my father.
-Stay with the family. Go on.

1271
02:37:08,669 --> 02:37:10,504
-Talk to me.
-The twins are dead.

1272
02:37:10,588 --> 02:37:14,758
In about one minute, there will be
carabinieri all over this place.

1273
02:37:15,635 --> 02:37:18,512
Get everybody to the cars, quietly.

1274
02:37:18,596 --> 02:37:20,222
-Got it.
-Quiet.

1275
02:37:34,904 --> 02:37:38,490
The name Corleone
will be associated with a voice.

1276
02:37:47,875 --> 02:37:49,209
Dad...

1277
02:38:08,896 --> 02:38:12,816
Dad... Why are you doing this to me?

1278
02:38:21,909 --> 02:38:24,494
Move back, move back.

1279
02:38:25,872 --> 02:38:29,958
-You don't have to do this to me.
-Do what? What do you mean?

1280
02:38:56,402 --> 02:38:57,652
Dad...

1281
02:39:14,754 --> 02:39:16,713
No! Mary!

1282
02:39:19,967 --> 02:39:21,384
God, no!
