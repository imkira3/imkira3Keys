2
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,727
"Booby Traps"?

3
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,644
There you are, my lovely.

4
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,361
What's that?

5
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,086
Take the book?

6
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,560
I don't mind if I do.

7
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,688
At last, it is mine.

8
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,406
Finally, you are mine.

9
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,405
All right. Let's do this. Bare knuckles.

10
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,722
Bring it on, skinny. You don't scare me.

11
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,500
You got any sevens?

12
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,090
Go fish.

13
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,285
Is that all you got?

14
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,806
Man, this is way overdue.

15
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,540
"Once upon a time, under the sea,

16
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,820
"there was a little town
called Bikini Bottom.

17
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,540
"In this town, there was a place
called The Krusty Krab,

18
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,645
"where folks would come to eat a thing
called the Krabby Patty.

19
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,727
"Every greasy spoon has a fry cook,
and the one who worked here

20
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,049
"was named SpongeBob SquarePants."

21
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,700
Who lives in a pineapple under the sea?

22
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,484
SpongeBob SquarePants!

23
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,660
Absorbent and yellow and porous is he

24
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,740
Just hold it. Hold it.

25
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,540
SpongeBob SquarePants!

26
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,620
If nautical nonsense
be something you wish

27
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,740
SpongeBob SquarePants!

28
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,740
Then drop on the deck
and flop like a fish

29
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,842
SpongeBob SquarePants!

30
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,161
Stop!

31
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,363
There's only one thing worse
than talking birds, and that would be...

32
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,620
Singing birds!

33
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,611
Okay, I promise not to si-i-i-ng.

34
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,300
Take it from us.

35
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,926
He really does hate singing birds.

36
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,691
Just keep weading.
Pwease, Mr. Piwate, sir.

37
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,121
Come closer while I tell you the tale.

38
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,807
- Okay, start reading.
- No. Not that close!

39
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,241
Yeah.

40
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,051
All right, here we go.

41
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:59,046
Now, SpongeBob loved his job
as a fry cook

42
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,809
more than anything.

43
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,281
And that is saying a lot

44
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,881
because he loved everything!

45
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,460
He loved his pet snail, Gary.

46
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,244
He loved his best friend, Patrick.

47
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,328
He loved blowing bubbles

48
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,328
and jellyfishing.

49
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,580
He loved making Krabby Patties
for the folks of Bikini Bottom

50
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,300
just as much as they loved eating them.

51
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,820
Why, you may ask,

52
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,940
do they love this
greasy little sandwich so much?

53
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,361
Why did they eat them for breakfast,

54
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,926
lunch,

55
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,940
and dinner,

56
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,660
despite their doctor's warnings?

57
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,285
He'll be gone in a week.

58
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,721
Oh, Harold!

59
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,130
It was a secret.

60
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,980
No one was sure what was

61
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,660
in these patties
that made them so delicious.

62
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,380
And, frankly, no one cared,

63
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,500
except for Plankton.

64
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,980
Plankton owned a restaurant
right across the street

65
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,220
from The Krusty Krab,

66
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,460
where no one ate
because the food was really bad.

67
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,289
Now, is that really necessary?

68
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,408
Plankton had made it his life's work
to steal the recipe.

69
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,700
SpongeBob, please,
let's talk about this!

70
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,963
And SpongeBob was
always there to protect it.

71
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,807
But today, things

72
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,011
would be different.

73
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,580
Good morning, SpongeBob!

74
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,780
Morning, Patrick!

75
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,660
You here for
your pre-lunch Krabby Patty?

76
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,420
I'm getting two today.

77
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,700
One for me and one for my friend.

78
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,620
Have I met this friend?

79
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,643
"You know me, SpongeBob."

80
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,129
Enjoy, Patrick's tummy.

81
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,766
Thirteen,

82
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,940
fourteen, fifteen...

83
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,408
Hey, Mr. Krabs, I thought we got
our tartar sauce delivery on Thursday.

84
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,726
Tartar...

85
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,900
Sauce?

86
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,411
Bull's-eye!

87
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,001
Plankton!

88
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,691
So it's a food fight he wants, eh?

89
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,460
Welcome to Air Plankton.

90
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,900
Please put your seat backs
and tray tables up

91
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,606
as we're now approaching
our final destination.

92
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,571
Okay, Patrick, load the potatoes!

93
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,540
Mashed or scalloped, sir?

94
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,420
No, Patrick. Raw.

95
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,681
Sir, yes, sir!

96
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,682
Locked and loaded!

97
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,780
Don't worry, little formuler,
you'll be safe in this

98
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,166
safe.

99
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,006
Fire!

100
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,960
Potatoes?

101
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,540
He's closing in!

102
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,723
I think we have a few minutes
before he gets here.

103
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,924
He's right on top of us!

104
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,765
Hey, it's raining fries!

105
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,083
It's gonna take a lot more than
potatoes to bring this baby down.

106
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,281
Or maybe not.

107
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,483
Wait a minute, Patrick, look!
He's got a tank!

108
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,566
Well, Krabs, you're certainly
in a pickle now!

109
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,481
Hey, it's raining pickles!

110
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,165
Now it's raining...

111
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,005
Tanks.

112
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,400
You're welcome!

113
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,291
Finland.

114
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,340
Your orders, sir!

115
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,020
I'll have two
Krabby Patties-extra ketchup,

116
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,327
extra mustard, and hold the mayo.

117
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,726
Wrong channel!

118
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,140
Your orders, sir!

119
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,926
Extra ketchup! Extra mustard!
Hold the mayo!

120
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,161
Yes, sir!

121
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,005
Extra ketchup! Extra mustard!

122
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,246
Hold the mayo!

123
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,860
Unleash the condiments!

124
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,610
With relish.

125
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,449
Excuse me.

126
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,161
Hello?

127
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,687
Hello?

128
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,922
- Guess y'all don't want my money.
- Money?

129
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,684
Thank you! Come again!

130
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:57,208
I can't hold the mayo any longer!

131
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:06,205
Mayo? Well, it's going to
take a lot more than mayo to stop...

132
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,366
Now what?

133
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,045
I just remembered,
I don't work for Mr. Krabs!

134
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,844
Robot! Robot!

135
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,281
Robot! Giant robot!

136
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,363
Robot! Robot!

137
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,940
Mr. Krabs, Plankton's here
and he's got a giant robot!

138
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,485
Quick, boy, bar the door!

139
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,006
Got it!

140
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,240
I'll take one secret formula

141
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,326
to go.

142
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,251
Oh, barnacles. I'm out of gas?

143
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,820
I'm not through yet.

144
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,740
I've got something that will make
you hand over that formula.

145
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,286
Something you can't resist.

146
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,340
Money!

147
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,010
Yes!

148
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,124
That's... That's... That's impossible!

149
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,527
Well, it was full of money
just last week.

150
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,860
And then I bought that airplane
and built that tank.

151
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:39,126
Sounds to me like
someone's just a wee bit broke!

152
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,940
Well, Krabs, I guess you've won.

153
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,806
I've spent every penny I've ever made
trying to put you out of business.

154
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,620
Except this one. My last penny.

155
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,610
Besides, what can I do
with one measly cent anyway?

156
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,860
You could give it to me.
Just a suggestion.

157
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,564
Here, take it.

158
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,485
You've taken everything else. Why not?

159
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,220
Well, Plankton,
like a reheated Krabby Patty,

160
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,527
you've been foiled again.

161
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,420
I guess this means the secret formula
is safe forever, right, Mr. Krabs?

162
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,045
It sure does, boy.

163
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,683
Why don't you scurry along?

164
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,411
Thanks for coming! Have a nice day!

165
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,531
He's been out there
crying for 20 minutes.

166
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,900
Pathetic.

167
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,890
I'm just going to
go out there and gloat a little.

168
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,780
Cyclops to Laptop. Come in, Laptop.

169
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,180
"Laptop." You do realize
that nickname is demeaning?

170
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,204
I have twice
the processing power of a laptop.

171
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,125
Never mind. Maintain radio silence.

172
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,686
Finally!

173
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,500
A pressure plate, eh, Krabs?

174
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,090
Amateur hour.

175
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,801
Perfect!

176
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,325
Not a bad likeness.

177
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,220
Good enough to fool that idiot Krabs.

178
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,402
Easy, easy.

179
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,300
Plankton's broke!

180
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,140
Look at Mr. Krabs go.

181
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,242
I've never seen him
gloat this hard before.

182
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,420
Hey, well, Plankton,

183
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,091
me bunions are telling me
it's time to stop gloating.

184
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,687
Looks like you're
falling apart at the seams.

185
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,180
Poor me.

186
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,931
- Sob, sob.
- A robot?

187
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,606
Plankton?

188
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,851
That ain't good.

189
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,443
Initiating lockdown sequence.

190
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,965
Me formuler!

191
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,220
No, no, no! No!

192
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,970
Squidward! Open up!

193
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,930
Victory dance. Boo-ya.

194
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,500
Give me that!

195
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,524
Come on, SpongeBob, join me!

196
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:35,440
And we'll be rich and powerful,
until I eventually betray you.

197
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,940
- Join me!
- No! Never!

198
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,122
I'm on Team Krabs for life!

199
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,125
Plankton!

200
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,740
What? Where'd it go?

201
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,220
Wait a minute. Molecular deconstruction?

202
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,500
I proved that to be
a scientific impossibility seven times!

203
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,380
Wait a minute.

204
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,086
I think I forgot to empty
Gary's litter box today.

205
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,220
Where's me formuler, Plankton?

206
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,940
I... I don't know! It just disappeared!

207
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,140
Why should I believe you,
you lying liar?

208
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,900
Normally, I'd agree with you, Mr. Krabs,

209
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,580
but this time he's telling the truth.
It just vanished!

210
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,250
It's true!

211
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,500
Mr. Krabs, I'm telling you
he's innocent!

212
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,170
What are you going to do, Krabs?

213
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,580
Pour hot oil on me?

214
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,762
Or put bamboo shoots under my nails?

215
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,691
No. Knock, knock.

216
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,321
Knock-knock jokes?
I can do this all day, Krabs.

217
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,726
Knock, knock.

218
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,008
Oh, boy. Who's there?

219
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,201
Jimmy.

220
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,521
Jimmy who?

221
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,730
Jimmy back my formuler, Plankton!

222
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,771
Well, that's stupid,
but how is it torture?

223
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,860
You'll see.

224
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,203
"Jimmy back my formula"?

225
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,050
I get it!

226
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,490
Make it stop, Krabs! Make it stop!

227
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,927
Mr. Krabs? SpongeBob, zip it!

228
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,900
Thank you, Squidward.

229
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,940
The customers are getting restless!

230
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:43,408
They're asking for refunds.

231
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,127
Refunds.

232
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,780
Refunds?

233
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,769
Refund! Refund!

234
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,020
Listen up, boy. Get in there

235
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,487
and make me customers
some Krabby Patties!

236
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,688
All right, Plankton...

237
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,002
SpongeBob! What's wrong, boy?

238
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,481
We're out of Krabby Patties?

239
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:13,780
How can we make more Krabby Patties
without the secret formula?

240
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,260
You've got to have
that formuler memorized by now!

241
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,660
But as you are aware, sir,

242
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,060
the employee handbook clearly states,
and I quote,

243
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,446
"No employee may, in part or in whole,

244
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,371
"commit the Krabby Patty secret formula
to any recorded written or visual form,

245
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,164
"including memories, dreams,
and/or needlepoint."

246
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,740
Curse you, fine print!

247
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,500
Refund! Refund! Refund!

248
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,045
Stop!

249
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,740
I'm not your enemy!

250
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,860
Plankton is your enemy!

251
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,201
So is he an anemone or a plankton?

252
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,801
Well, someone had to do it.

253
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,100
But Mr. Krabs...

254
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,441
He took this from you!

255
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,540
- Krabby Patty...
- I can almost taste it.

256
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,180
Mr. Krabs, Plankton didn't take
the secret formula.

257
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,964
Not now, SpongeBob!

258
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,370
Hey! I ordered a double Krabby Patty!

259
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,570
So join me! Help get the formuler back,

260
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:07,885
and I'll give each and every one of
you a free Krabby Patty!

261
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,060
No! Wait!

262
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,845
Even better, a slight discount!

263
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,420
To The Chum Bucket!

264
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,010
But he didn't do it.

265
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,290
I had it right in my greedy little mitts,
and then... Poof!

266
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,340
And now it's gone. Gone forever.

267
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,683
I was so close to
gaining the people's respect-slash-fear.

268
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,100
Plankton?

269
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,020
When will my
frustration-slash-humiliation end?

270
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,100
- Plankton?
- Not now, hon!

271
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,884
I'm ranting-slash-raving.

272
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,340
All right, what is it?

273
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:48,001
Well, I was trying to tell you
there's an angry mob outside.

274
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,681
But now they're inside.

275
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,050
I just work here.

276
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,891
We'd like to have a word with you!

277
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,722
You all look very hungry.

278
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,860
Can I get anybody a Chum Burger?

279
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,564
Enough with the niceties, Plankton!

280
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,724
This is the last time
I'm going to ask you.

281
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,900
Where is me formuler?

282
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,641
I told you, Krabs, I don't have it.

283
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,842
Wrong answer.

284
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,580
Stop!

285
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,047
All right, Mr. Krabs,
let me get in on this.

286
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,843
What's going on around here?

287
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,220
You may want to
step back a little, Mr. Krabs.

288
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,367
This could get messy.

289
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,606
Let's hope so.

290
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,380
So you won't talk, eh, Plankton?

291
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,620
I didn't want to have to do this.

292
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,485
Plankton, here comes the pain.

293
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,843
Soap in the eye, eh? Diabolical!

294
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,607
No! Stop! Don't!

295
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,123
Wait. That didn't look painful.

296
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,642
Mr. Krabs, you may not understand
what I'm about to do today,

297
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,290
but someday we'll look back
and have a good laugh.

298
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,020
Wait a minute.

299
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,963
Hey, they're getting away!

300
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,970
Sorry, Mr. Krabs!

301
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,131
So, you've been running
a long con on me, eh?

302
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,889
All these years you've been
working for Plankton!

303
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,365
They're in cahoots!

304
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,460
Yeah, I guess
that's a short way of saying it.

305
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,289
Stop that bubble!

306
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,721
Please tell me
there's something soft below me.

307
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,481
- Nope.
- Nope.

308
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,648
SpongeBob!

309
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,860
You were like an underpaid son to me.

310
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,089
I would've expected Squidward
to stab me in the back.

311
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,220
What?

312
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,540
But SpongeBob?

313
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:47,580
Me most trusted employee?
Working with me sworn enemy?

314
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,490
You know what this means, Mr. Squidward.

315
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,900
We get the rest of the day off?

316
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,980
No!

317
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:56,687
This be but a harbinger
of what I fear lies ahead.

318
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,370
For you. For me.

319
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,170
For all of Bikini Bottom!

320
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,820
The Krabby Patty
is what ties us all together!

321
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:07,562
Without it, there will be
a complete breakdown of social order.

322
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,320
A war of all against all!

323
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,211
Dark times are ahead.

324
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,325
Dark times indeed!

325
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,881
Seriously?

326
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,888
Aren't you overreacting a bit?

327
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,401
Welcome to the apocalypse,
Mr. Squidward.

328
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,042
I hope you like leather.

329
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,850
I prefer suede.

330
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,962
And so Bikini Bottom became

331
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,046
an apocalyptic cesspool forevermore.

332
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,760
The end.

333
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,244
Wait a minute. That's a terrible ending.

334
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,620
- This is bad. Really bad.
- What? What?

335
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,927
SpongeBob's in trouble
and the story's over?

336
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,889
Ouch. Ouch. Ouch.

337
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,570
Hey, call a therapist!

338
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,331
I have anxiety!

339
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,402
There is no way that
that's the end of this story.

340
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,340
Of course it is. I'll show you.

341
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,521
Just turn around.

342
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,241
All right.

343
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,060
Hey!

344
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,128
I need that to fly, you jerk.

345
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,040
"The

346
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,446
"End"!

347
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,286
That's not the end!

348
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,820
Of course it is!

349
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,940
- Unhand that book!
- You let go of that!

350
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,485
Let go, you numbskull!

351
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,081
You better keep reading, Mr. Pirate,

352
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,921
or else!

353
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:41,290
I know I shouldn't be littering,
but that ending was rubbish!

354
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,849
Rubbish!

355
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,721
Good morning, Squidward.
I'll have the usual.

356
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,580
With cheese.

357
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,580
We're out of Krabby Patties right now!

358
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,206
No Krabby Patties?

359
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,007
No!

360
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,164
Look what's become of Bikini Bottom.

361
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,841
We've really gotta get
that formula back.

362
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,540
Get the secret formula, you say?

363
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,610
Excuse me, I need a moment.

364
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:27,407
With that formula,
I could rule the world!

365
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,020
You know I can hear you, right?

366
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,100
Well, what do we do now?

367
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,220
Now we work together.
You know, teamwork.

368
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,540
What's "tee-am work"?

369
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,165
No, Plankton, teamwork.

370
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,620
Tee-am work.

371
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,051
- Teamwork.
- Tie-'em work.

372
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,140
- Teamwork.
- Tie 'em up!

373
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,561
- Say "team," like a sports...
- Team.

374
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,404
- Team. Now say "work."
- Work.

375
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,567
Put them together. What do you got?

376
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,330
Time bomb work.

377
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,527
Getting better!

378
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,563
Now, Bikini Bottom Action News!

379
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,220
Hey, Patrick!

380
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:08,881
Krabby Patty, Krabby Patty,
Krabby Patty, Krabby Patty!

381
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,284
Krabby Patty, Krabby Patty, Krabby...

382
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,980
Krabby Patty, Krabby...

383
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,540
Krabby Patty...

384
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,980
Krabby...

385
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,162
Krabby!

386
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:26,441
Come on, tummy,
it's gonna be a long day.

387
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:30,540
We interrupt your regular program
for an important news bulletin.

388
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,740
Perch Perkins reporting live
from downtown Bikini Bottom.

389
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:38,003
Complete chaos here today
as our town attempts to deal with

390
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:42,380
a sudden and complete shortage
of Krabby Patties.

391
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,500
Events here have
this reporter wondering,

392
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:48,220
what is the secret ingredient
in Krabby Patties anyway?

393
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,564
It's love!
The secret ingredient is love!

394
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,900
No more Krabby Patties?

395
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,288
If I'd have known that,
I'd have chewed it slower.

396
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,682
What the corndog is that?

397
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,122
Come on, Plankton, it's easy!

398
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,860
It means, I help you, you help me,
and when we accomplish our goal,

399
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,246
then we do hands in the middle.

400
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,364
Hands in the middle?
No, no. Sounds idiotic.

401
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,809
Besides, the two of us
are no match for that cranky mob!

402
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,380
We could probably
use a few more tee-am works.

403
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,860
That's exactly what I was thinking!

404
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,325
Wait, what are you doing?

405
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,970
I need Krabby Patties!

406
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,570
Patrick, what are you doing?

407
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,860
Krabby Patties!

408
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,405
Vandalizing stuff.

409
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,260
Isn't that your house?

410
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,020
Hey, what's with all the questions?

411
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,485
Who are you guys?

412
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,980
It's me, your best friend! SpongeBob?

413
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,206
Yeah?

414
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:57,564
Well, if you're SpongeBob,
then what's the secret password?

415
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,161
Uh...

416
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,260
Correct! It is you!

417
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,380
SpongeBob!

418
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,260
- SpongeBob.
- Patrick!

419
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,060
SpongeBob!

420
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:11,220
Why aren't you at The Krusty Krab
making Krabby Patties?

421
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,380
Well, I'd love to,
but the formula's gone.

422
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,540
Yeah, Mr. Krabs says
you and Plankton took it.

423
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,180
No, that's not what happened.

424
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,660
It just disappeared.

425
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,740
We're putting a team together
to find it.

426
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,251
A team?

427
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,724
Pick me! Pick me! Pick me!

428
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,060
Okay, Patrick, you're in.

429
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,650
I don't know, SpongeBob.

430
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:31,168
What exactly does this clown
bring to the tee-am?

431
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,522
He brings loyalty, Plankton.

432
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,060
Loyalty. Isn't that right, Patrick?

433
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,525
Yeah, yeah, loyalty.

434
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,082
I've got SpongeBob!

435
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,680
He's over here!

436
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,207
Let's go get him!

437
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,020
Come on, SpongeBob,
let's get out of here!

438
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,360
Patrick!

439
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,803
Patrick, why are you doing this?

440
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,167
Because I need

441
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,140
Krabby Patties!

442
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,242
Hurry up! I'm hungry!

443
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,490
Over here!

444
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:15,209
Guys, am I still on the team?

445
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,603
Hey, what are you looking at?

446
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,720
Sandy!

447
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,085
Sandy!

448
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,926
Sandy?

449
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,008
Sandy, are you home?

450
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,283
Gee, Plankton, I wonder where she is.

451
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,968
What is all this stuff?

452
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,161
Sandy?

453
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,725
Don't touch that!

454
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,924
Incoherent muttering.

455
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,140
Sandy? Are you okay?

456
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,446
Okay?

457
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,380
Have you looked outside?
Does that seem "okay" to you?

458
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,370
I'm trying to figure out
what happened to society.

459
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:08,048
If we don't fix it soon,
there won't be anything left to fix!

460
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,060
Sandy?

461
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,340
The lack of Krabby Patties
has driven her mad.

462
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,100
And I think I figgered it out.

463
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,281
Look.

464
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,285
When this came down from above,

465
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,929
I knew it could only mean one thing.

466
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,531
And that would be?

467
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,803
It means it's the end!

468
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,641
The sandwich gods are angry with us!

469
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,180
- Sandwich gods?
- Sandwich gods?

470
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:39,966
I just don't know
how we're going to appease them!

471
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,260
You got any other friends
who aren't dim bulbs or nut jobs?

472
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:54,285
Well, I have one friend
who's loyal to the very end.

473
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,685
Gary, I'm home.

474
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,766
Gare-bear?

475
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,881
Gary?

476
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,361
Gary?

477
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,220
Revolting!

478
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,180
But it means Gary is close by!

479
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,248
Gary, I'm back!

480
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,900
Hey, Gary, Plankton and I need you
to help us find the Krabby Patty formula

481
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,411
and fix Bikini Bottom.

482
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:31,091
What do you mean,
you don't have to do as I say anymore?

483
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,121
What do you mean, "King of Snails"?

484
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,529
Gary The Snail, you get down here
right now and join this team!

485
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,844
What do you mean, "Seize them"?

486
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,700
Why are you running?

487
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,882
Because they're right on our tail.

488
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,660
Right, snails.

489
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:57,660
Well, so much for your tee-am.

490
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:01,500
Putting together a team is a lot harder
than I thought it would be!

491
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,931
This way!

492
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,805
We better get out of here
until things cool off.

493
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:20,163
Everything we know and love
has been destroyed.

494
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,940
Yeah, looks like they're gonna have to

495
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:25,010
change the name of Bikini Bottom
to Dirty Bottom.

496
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,980
Right, SpongeBob?

497
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,980
That's kind of gross, Plankton.

498
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,401
Yeah. Yeah, too soon, huh?

499
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,324
This feels like it really is the end.

500
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,328
Don't worry, SpongeBob,

501
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,100
we'll find the secret formula

502
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,380
and everything will go back
to the way it was,

503
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,721
you know, all happy and junk.

504
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:51,247
Now let's try and get some sleep.

505
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,560
Yeah, I guess you're right.

506
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:04,723
Here you are. Feel comfy?

507
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,220
You know, Plankton,

508
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:11,121
I think you might know a little bit more
about teamwork than you let on.

509
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,810
Good night, SpongeBob.

510
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,965
Good night, Plankton.

511
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,846
"Good night," indeed.

512
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,080
That's right, SpongeBob, sleep.

513
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:27,329
You're hiding that formula
in there somewhere.

514
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,486
Well, here goes nothing.

515
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:45,009
What is this place?

516
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,060
Fudge fight!

517
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,481
It's all over me!

518
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,100
It's so sweet in here!

519
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,580
I think my eyeball
is getting a toothache!

520
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,284
Hello, Plankton.

521
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,806
Come and play with us.

522
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,005
Hurry

523
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,361
before we melt.

524
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,300
So much sweetness.

525
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,482
I think I'm going to be sick!

526
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,806
Daddy!

527
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,540
Plankton? Plankton!

528
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,340
I just had the craziest dream!
And you were in it!

529
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,771
I'm sure it was nothing.

530
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,806
Now go back to sleep.

531
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,405
Were you in my brain?

532
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,404
What? No! That's crazy talk!

533
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,900
Then why is there
cotton candy on your antenna?

534
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,765
Because, because...

535
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,848
Okay, fine, I was in your brain.

536
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,020
What were you doing in there?

537
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,780
What do you think I was doing?

538
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,460
Looking for the secret formula.

539
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,608
- What?
- Don't act so innocent.

540
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,250
You knew what I was up to.

541
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,780
That's why you're pretending
not to know the formula.

542
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,140
I'm not pretending!

543
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,020
I can't believe you thought I was lying.

544
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,780
Hey, don't take it personally.

545
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,620
I just assume everyone is lying.

546
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,340
That is a horrible way

547
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,124
- to live your life.
- Whatever.

548
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:36,050
It is! And if we're going
to be on the same team...

549
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:40,643
Maybe I don't want to be on the tee-am!
You think of that?

550
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:43,764
But, Plankton, everything's better
when you're part of a team.

551
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,300
You're not going
to start singing, are you?

552
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,380
Teamwork!

553
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,460
Oh, brother.

554
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,460
We can do anything when we have teamwork

555
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,540
Don't you think so, my friend?

556
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,165
No, tee-am work

557
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,891
Is getting in the way
of my schee-am work

558
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,380
What don't you comprehend?

559
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,482
But working together is the key

560
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:06,730
Nothing's impossible
when it's you and me

561
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,922
I'm doing just fine on my own

562
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,929
Work is no fun when you do it alone

563
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,380
If I want it done right,
I'll do it by myself

564
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,420
But what if you need
something on a higher shelf?

565
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,580
But I'm the target

566
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,180
Of a very scary,
crazy post-apocalyptic mob!

567
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,100
Well, that's exactly
why you need a partner

568
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,363
Helping you with this important job

569
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,522
I'll be the hammer, you'll be the nail

570
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,483
I'll be the boat and you'll be the sail

571
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,700
I'm the flower, you're the aroma

572
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,900
Right now I wish I was in a coma

573
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,060
Come on.

574
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,140
I'm here for you and you're here for me

575
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,686
It's better when you plus me equals we

576
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:44,003
Working together in harmony

577
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,367
Side by side, we can reach our dreams

578
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,020
'Cause nothing's impossible

579
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,540
When we're a team!

580
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:53,100
All right, you can put me down.

581
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,540
Well...

582
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,860
That's one minute of my life
I'll never get back.

583
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,371
Not without a time machine.

584
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,482
Wait a minute. Hold that thought.

585
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,321
Now back up.

586
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,926
Slow down.

587
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,520
Not without a time machine.

588
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,521
Yes!

589
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,684
- SpongeBob, you're a genius!
- I am?

590
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,940
If we build a time machine,

591
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,700
we can go back to before
the formula disappeared.

592
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:25,441
Before society broke down.
Before we became the hunted!

593
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:29,690
That sounds great, Plankton,
but how do we build a time machine?

594
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,820
Well, first we'll need
a computer powerful enough

595
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,020
to calculate the intricacies
of time travel.

596
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,043
Where would we get one of those?

597
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,331
There she is. My computer wife.

598
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,562
They've got her tied up
in the back room.

599
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,900
I've never seen
this many people at The Chum Bucket.

600
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,140
I've never seen anyone there.

601
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,460
Now was that really necessary?

602
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,740
Cause the food's really bad.

603
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,420
Come on! Really?

604
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,761
How are we gonna
sneak past those guards?

605
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,451
Well, what do we have here?

606
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,449
We better hurry.
Those guys really hate tires.

607
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:21,445
We'll never get in. The door's locked.

608
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,011
Wait. The window is open.

609
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,100
Come on, Plankton,

610
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,060
it's time for some teamwork.
Give me a boost.

611
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,128
Okay. Wait a minute, no!

612
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,802
Just a little higher, Plankton.

613
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,601
Plankton?

614
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:43,091
Why don't you boost me up instead?

615
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,571
Yeah, good thinking.

616
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,887
Come on, SpongeBob, come on!

617
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,051
We're in!

618
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,164
There's a guard over there.

619
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,520
Let's take the key from around his neck.

620
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,740
We're gonna have to be very quiet.

621
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,320
Let's walk on the tips of our toes.

622
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,180
Will you stop playing that tiny piano?

623
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,805
You're gonna get us caught.

624
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:27,921
Sorry.

625
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:33,364
Now just reach over and grab it.

626
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,642
Halt! Who goes there?

627
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,685
Stop! Pull it over his head!

628
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,121
Stop, stop, stop!

629
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,403
Let me get up there.

630
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,570
Help me.

631
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,805
What?

632
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,921
No!

633
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,570
Plankton, help!

634
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,563
I'll rock him,
you tell him a bedtime story.

635
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,460
Once upon a time

636
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,882
there was a big fat pink idiot
who went to sleep. The end!

637
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,924
Nice try, but it's
gonna take more than that to...

638
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:03,244
I told you, I don't have the formula,
you monsters!

639
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,807
- Hey, baby, how are you?
- Plankton!

640
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,260
My hero! You must need something,

641
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,089
otherwise you wouldn't have come back.

642
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,925
Plankton has a plan
to save Bikini Bottom.

643
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:20,731
It doesn't matter, Plankton.
Krabs knows all your plans.

644
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:23,844
He's been through my hard drive
looking for the secret formula.

645
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,940
I never had it.
But we're going to get it.

646
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,610
We're gonna go back in time

647
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,961
to steal the formula
before it disappeared.

648
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,201
Time travel!

649
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,580
Where are you gonna find
a computer that can do that?

650
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:35,920
Wait a minute!

651
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,780
I've never carried a head before.

652
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,291
You'll get used to it.

653
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,050
It's still warm.

654
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,940
So you won't talk, huh?

655
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,804
Let some air out of him.

656
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,687
Is this where
we're gonna build our time machine?

657
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,167
Sure. It's got everything we need.

658
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,321
A photo booth.

659
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,925
A cuckoo clock.

660
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,761
Some day-old chips.

661
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,002
Now all we have to do is build it.

662
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,980
- Oh, no, you don't!
- Hey, my pitch pipe!

663
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,620
I need it. For the time machine.

664
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,960
Okay.

665
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,411
Installed!

666
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,260
I did it!

667
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,460
No, we did it!

668
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,403
Wait. We did do it.

669
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,780
As a tee-am.

670
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,580
- A team.
- Whatever.

671
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:53,843
Working together in harmony

672
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,241
Side by side, we can reach our dreams

673
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:00,246
'Cause nothing's impossible
When we're a team

674
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,727
Okay, now for the brains!

675
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,460
Okay, Plankton, this is it.

676
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:10,201
It's gonna take all my processors
and energy to power this time machine.

677
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,340
So if you have anything
you wanna tell me,

678
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,851
you better tell me now.

679
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,260
Well, Karen...

680
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:19,762
I know I've taken you for granted
all these years,

681
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:23,420
and I, I just wanted to say,

682
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,807
I'm glad you're on my tee-am.

683
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,730
Oh, Sheldon, that's the sweetest thing
you've ever...

684
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,460
Plankton, are you crying?

685
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,324
No, no, no!

686
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:40,700
It's just one of the hazards
of having a giant eyeball.

687
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,740
There's always stuff getting in there.

688
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,569
Anyway, where were we?

689
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,285
Say "cheese."

690
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,125
Cheese!

691
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,682
According to my calculations,

692
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,780
The Krusty Krab should be right here!

693
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,723
What's that over there?

694
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,281
- SpongeBob?
- Patrick?

695
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,805
Is it really you?

696
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,843
- Yes, Patrick, it's...
- Finally!

697
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:30,846
The Great Krabby Patty Famine is over!

698
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,288
Great Krabby Patty Famine?
What year is this?

699
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,646
It's Thursday.

700
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,860
According to my calculations,

701
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:40,440
we've only gone
four days into the future.

702
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,170
Where is everybody?

703
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:46,100
They all gave up on you. But not me!

704
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,362
Cause I'm not very smart.

705
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,928
Where is The Krusty Krab?

706
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,282
Right where it's always been!

707
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:23,820
I think we may be
lost in time, Plankton.

708
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,207
Maybe we should ask
this guy for directions.

709
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:30,609
Excuse me, sir?
Can you tell us when we are?

710
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:36,260
Who dares disturb
The One Who Watches?

711
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:37,646
The One Who Watches?

712
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,700
Your name is The One Who Watches?

713
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:43,300
No, my true name is

714
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,084
Bubbles.

715
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,700
Bubbles?

716
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:50,565
What kind of a name is Bubbles?

717
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:53,331
It is my ancient dolphin name.

718
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:56,450
So what's a dolphin doing out here
in the middle of space?

719
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:00,300
My kind have been
watching and protecting

720
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,687
the galaxy for...

721
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,722
10,000 years!

722
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:11,020
So you're the one
keeping the meteors from hitting us.

723
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:12,246
Yes, I am.

724
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:15,340
And I could really do
with a potty break.

725
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:18,171
Would you mind keeping an eye on things?

726
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:22,321
Sure thing.
But what am I keeping my eye on?

727
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,086
What are you doing?

728
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:34,605
I'm watching.

729
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,245
We don't even know
what we're watching for.

730
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,580
Maybe we should split up the workload.

731
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,340
You watch the one with the big red eye,

732
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,283
I'll watch the one
with the ringy thingies.

733
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,084
Like a team.

734
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,531
Okay, mine's moving.

735
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,125
Mine, too.

736
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,565
No, this doesn't seem right.

737
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:50,740
Should we call Bubbles?

738
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:53,446
Let's give him a minute.
He's been holding it for 10,000 years.

739
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,300
I'm pretty sure
that wasn't supposed to happen.

740
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,060
Come on, Plankton,
we got to clean this up

741
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,288
before Bubbles gets back!

742
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,851
Much better. Yes.

743
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:14,686
You two are free to go.

744
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,771
What happened to Saturn and Jupiter?

745
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,722
You were supposed to...

746
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,620
Keep them from smashing into each other!

747
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:36,801
Sorry.

748
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:39,207
Now I am going to lose my job!

749
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:42,887
And you will lose your lives.

750
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:51,845
Quarter me!

751
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,440
Plankton?

752
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,200
SpongeBob!

753
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,804
Plankton?

754
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:25,260
SpongeBob?

755
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:27,044
Who are you two supposed to be?

756
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:29,020
I'm you, from the future.

757
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,849
And I'm him from the future.

758
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,500
So you traveled back through time
to help me? Great thinking.

759
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:35,940
Nope. He's helping me.

760
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:37,460
But he's the enemy!

761
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:39,820
Was the enemy. Now we're a team.

762
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,888
What? A tee-am?

763
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:43,730
A team!

764
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:46,042
All right, go get the formula.

765
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:48,125
What have I become?

766
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:49,566
All right, Plankton.

767
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,780
Do you have
flying boatmobiles in the future?

768
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:57,340
We only came back
from the day after tomorrow, dimwit.

769
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,010
Are there rocket packs?

770
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,300
- Did they outlaw clothes in the future?
- No!

771
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,460
Then why are you naked?

772
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,927
Because they don't make
clothes in my size.

773
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,087
Hold still, you!

774
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:13,180
If you're from the future,
what am I gonna say next?

775
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,408
- Something moronic?
- Wow.

776
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,284
Hey, hurry up over there!

777
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:20,364
That ain't good.

778
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,380
Initiating lockdown sequence.

779
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,847
Come on, SpongeBob,
we gotta get out of here!

780
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:28,487
- Got it!
- Come on!

781
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:40,060
That was crazy!

782
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,540
So that's what teamwork is.

783
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,300
All those years I tried
to make you mine,

784
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,260
and I finally did it.

785
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:49,761
I mean, we did it!

786
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:52,930
And so it would seem that

787
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:57,881
our heroes have accomplished
all they had set out to do.

788
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,740
Now that's an ending.

789
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:02,410
Andy, cue the music.

790
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,531
Oh, no.

791
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,700
That's not the end.

792
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,849
So you mean the ending
might be even happier?

793
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,291
Here we go!

794
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:22,682
Land ho!

795
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,409
Mom, where's my towel?

796
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:30,441
What?

797
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,208
- Dude, look at that.
- What?

798
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,526
I'm coming! Come on, you lazy people!

799
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:46,883
Out of my way! I'm coming!

800
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:48,806
Out of there!

801
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:51,006
Sorry!

802
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:53,242
- Too fast!
- Slow down!

803
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,682
- I'm coming!
- No, no!

804
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:12,860
Yeah!

805
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:16,726
All right, you feathered rats,
time to shove off!

806
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,008
What? Why?

807
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:24,724
Well, I can't have you pooping
all over my restaurant, can I?

808
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:27,127
Restaurant? I thought
this was a pirate ship.

809
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:30,100
It is.

810
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,725
But it is also...

811
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:48,805
My very own food truck!

812
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:50,001
A what?

813
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:52,608
You know, a restaurant on wheels.

814
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:54,763
- Like a garbage truck.
- No!

815
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:57,082
Are you trying to
scare away my customers?

816
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:00,124
Well, we're not leaving
till we see how the story ends.

817
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:02,091
No problem.

818
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:06,604
You guys like
a little snack while you wait?

819
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,500
- Sure, I'll take a curdled milk.
- How about a fish head?

820
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:10,045
And a French fry covered in sand.

821
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:12,660
Who wants some

822
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:15,001
hot wings?

823
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:17,083
Wait a minute. Where's Kyle?

824
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:20,770
Which one of you is next?

825
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,451
He's a madman!

826
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:24,620
Let's get out of here!

827
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,609
You crazy, man! You crazy!

828
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,140
Bye-bye, Mr. Poop.

829
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:32,526
Now I can get my gold sticker.

830
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:36,300
Hey, Mr. Piwate.

831
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,482
I wouldn't go in there if I were you.

832
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:44,805
I can't fly without my feathers.

833
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:48,660
Where to, Mac?

834
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:50,330
Just dwive.

835
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:01,007
Squidward!

836
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:03,168
Still out of Krabby Patties.

837
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:08,410
Does anyone have a picture of ketchup?

838
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:10,685
I done figgered it out!

839
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:19,484
We have angered the sandwich gods
and only a sacrifice will appease them!

840
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:21,290
Well, that sounds reasonable.

841
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:24,882
Soon our post-apoca-whatchamacallit
will be over,

842
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:28,940
and Krabby Patties
will rain down from above!

843
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:31,500
Rain down? Well, that's no good.

844
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:33,364
How will I get me money?

845
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:36,603
You don't like that idea?
Then we'll sacrifice you!

846
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:39,525
Sacrifice! Sacrifice!

847
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:47,620
It's not a good idea to have a sacrifice

848
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:49,740
on an empty stomach.

849
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,922
Who wants a Krabby Patty?

850
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:56,940
SpongeBob, is that me formuler?

851
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,644
Oh, happy day!

852
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:01,371
I missed you so much.

853
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,740
Where was it? Where did you find it?

854
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:05,780
Well, Plankton and I
built a time machine

855
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:07,740
out of an old photo booth
and then we added...

856
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:09,285
- Cheese!
- Patrick, wait!

857
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:12,364
It's okay, everyone.

858
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:15,285
The post-apocalypse is almost over!

859
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,722
Ain't that right, SpongeBob?

860
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:23,688
"Eugene, eat my

861
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:27,566
"subaquatic air bubbles.
Love, Plankton"?

862
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:30,700
You grabbed the wrong bottle!

863
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,460
I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs!

864
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:34,420
That's okay, SpongeBob.

865
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:37,540
We'll just have to sacrifice
the two of you then.

866
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:40,769
Prepare them for the sacrifice!

867
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:45,802
I bring a message from the dawn of time!

868
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,001
What is it, Patrick?

869
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,611
Run!

870
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:54,002
Squidosaurus rex!

871
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:05,500
Well, Plankton,

872
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,900
I guess we failed
to accomplish our goals.

873
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,500
"We"?

874
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:13,940
But even failure hurts a little less
when you do it as a team, right?

875
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:15,610
This is all your fault!

876
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:19,020
My fault?

877
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:21,860
You're the one who stole
the wrong secret formula.

878
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:23,540
I didn't know there were two bottles.

879
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:25,740
Of course you didn't!

880
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:28,366
Because you got cotton candy for brains!

881
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:31,962
No, seriously, he really does.

882
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:34,220
Well, we wouldn't even be in this mess
in the first place,

883
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:36,060
if you weren't so selfish and evil.

884
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,940
I was selfish and evil,

885
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:40,964
until you ruined everything
with your "teamwork"!

886
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:43,049
You take that back!

887
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:46,403
You are the worst teammate ever!

888
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:47,521
No!

889
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:01,482
Oh, my Neptune, he's mixing
garbage and recycling!

890
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,684
Look at me.

891
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,323
Why, I've become like all of you.

892
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,690
Savage.

893
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:20,126
Fear-ridden.

894
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:21,771
Selfish.

895
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:25,003
An entire town of formerly good citizens

896
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:27,660
turned into heartless freaks,

897
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:29,620
bent on their own self-prever...

898
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:31,260
Self-preter...

899
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:33,700
- "Preservation?"
- Yes!

900
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:36,580
We've become alienated from each other.

901
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:39,020
Each one an island unto himself,

902
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:41,180
concerned only with ourselves.

903
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:43,044
And in the name of all fishhood,

904
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,521
I am not about to let that happen!

905
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:51,100
And so,

906
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:55,762
if a sacrifice is needed to restore
Bikini Bottom to its former glory...

907
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:01,242
Then I am willing
to take one for the team!

908
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:13,401
You heard him!

909
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,245
Sacrifice!

910
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:19,643
Sacrifice! Sacrifice!

911
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:21,140
Sacrifice!

912
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:24,244
Sacrifice! Sacrifice!

913
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:32,371
Let the sacrifice begin!

914
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:34,608
Patties! Patties!

915
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:38,365
And I thought my friends were primitive.

916
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:41,660
Don't cry, me boy.

917
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:44,860
Everything's going to be fine, for us.

918
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:47,540
I'm not crying, Mr. Krabs.

919
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:49,085
I smell Krabby Patties!

920
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:52,540
That's right.
Keep thinking happy thoughts.

921
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:53,801
Now!

922
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:55,689
Sacrifice! Sacrifice!

923
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:09,330
The boy's right.

924
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:11,020
My leg!

925
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:12,420
I smell 'em, too!

926
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:14,807
Okay, SpongeBob, go get it!

927
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:18,527
Wait. You mean we can
just take this stuff off?

928
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:20,290
Go find that Krabby Patty!

929
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,240
Come on, everybody!

930
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:28,489
I've got some Krabby Patty
orders to fill!

931
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:38,482
It's coming from over there!

932
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:03,842
Come on, guys,
I think it's just over this hill.

933
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,980
How do you expect us
to go up to the surface?

934
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:11,300
We won't be able to breathe!

935
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:14,290
All right, all secondary characters
come with me.

936
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:17,740
- Yeah, I'm with you guys.
- No way, Squidward.

937
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:20,060
You're going up there with us.

938
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:21,580
My feet hurt.

939
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:23,250
Patrick, you don't have feet.

940
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:26,980
It's not fair! You have feet.

941
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:30,880
Sandy has feet. Squidward has feet.

942
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:32,644
Actually, I have four feet.

943
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:38,100
It's not about feet.

944
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:39,620
What is it about, then?

945
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:43,566
It's about being a team
and sticking together, no matter what!

946
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:45,980
The only way
we're going up there is if some

947
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:49,482
fairy godmother shows up
and helps us breathe air.

948
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:57,580
- Bubbles!
- SpongeBob, you know this guy?

949
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:59,780
Don't hurt us!
We're sorry we got you fired.

950
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:02,100
Hurt you?

951
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:05,170
Why, I traveled back
through time to thank you.

952
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:08,210
I've been stuck in that job for eons.

953
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:10,620
I needed a change,

954
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:13,610
but I was too afraid to go for it.

955
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:16,660
Well, Bubbles, I'm glad we could help.

956
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:19,380
Now it is my turn to help.

957
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:22,245
I can get you safely to the surface.

958
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:23,980
Now!

959
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:27,460
Quick, all of you, get in my mouth.

960
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:28,940
Come on, guys, let's go!

961
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:32,249
There's no way I'm climbing
into some dolphin's mouth.

962
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:34,840
Yeah. This guy just wants a free lunch.

963
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:39,140
Guys, if Bubbles has the courage
to quit his dead-end, nowhere job

964
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:41,180
and travel back through time to help us,

965
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:43,248
then we need to have the courage to...

966
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:50,122
Well, I never thought
I'd be eaten by a dolphin.

967
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,340
No, if he was eating us,

968
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:53,727
he'd be chewing us up
and we'd be going down there.

969
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:56,180
This is what you call riding in style.

970
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:58,601
Not a lot of legroom in here.

971
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:01,485
Well, maybe if you didn't
have four feet!

972
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:06,168
Note to self:
Never stow away in a gym sock.

973
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:20,165
What's happening? I feel tingly!

974
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:29,961
My neck!

975
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:34,180
I've done all I can.

976
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:36,420
The rest is up to you.

977
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:38,045
Thank you, Bubbles!

978
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,208
Farewell, SpongeBob.

979
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:41,820
Farewell, Bubbles.

980
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:44,082
Now to update my...

981
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:47,520
Resume!

982
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:55,724
Fresh air! How I've missed you.

983
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:58,444
This place smells awful!

984
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:00,091
Come on, guys.

985
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:02,931
Let's get the Krabby Patty formula
and save Bikini Bottom.

986
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:08,180
What is this place?

987
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:11,284
I have a bad feeling about this.

988
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:14,768
Maybe this guy knows where we are.
He looks smart.

989
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:16,780
He's got five heads.

990
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:19,860
Sir? Could you tell us
where to find a Krabby Patty?

991
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:22,611
Hey, my friend's talking to you!

992
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:24,447
What?

993
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:28,928
A giant, hairy porpoise!

994
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:30,931
It's beached!

995
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:34,329
It's suffering. Poor thing.

996
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:35,620
Y'all, those aren't porpoises.

997
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:37,722
- All hands on deck!
- Oh, brother.

998
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:40,608
We need to get these guys
back in the water.

999
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,131
Come on! Push!

1000
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:44,368
- Heave!
- Ho!

1001
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:50,844
- Heave!
- Ho!

1002
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:52,460
Put your back into it!

1003
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:54,164
Come on, push!

1004
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:59,246
Well, I guess this is where that
horrible smell was coming from.

1005
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:16,970
Excuse me, do you know where we can get
a Krabby Patty around here?

1006
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:18,690
Invaders!

1007
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,660
You get out of my sister's sand castle!

1008
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:23,841
Mom!

1009
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:41,651
Where have you been all my life?

1010
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:51,820
Oh, Frank.

1011
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:53,763
That feels so good.

1012
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:57,121
Gross!

1013
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:01,370
Oh, hey, Squidward.

1014
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:03,860
Sandy!

1015
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:05,371
The Krabby Patty!

1016
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:06,845
I think I see where it's coming from!

1017
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:23,740
SpongeBob, you will not believe the size
of the ice creams here.

1018
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:26,060
I wonder what
other giant snacks they have.

1019
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:28,208
Cotton candy?

1020
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:33,900
If you ate all that,
you'd have enough energy

1021
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,684
to run around the whole world!

1022
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:00,771
When is the sugar gonna wear off?

1023
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:09,766
Hey, guys, I smell Krabby Patties!

1024
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:11,803
I think it's this way!

1025
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:16,805
Don't leave me, Squidward!

1026
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:26,210
- Now what?
- We're never going to make it!

1027
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:37,207
- Heave!
- Ho!

1028
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:40,926
We're doing it, guys!

1029
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:44,566
Dude, watch out!

1030
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:46,925
Hold on!

1031
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:49,967
SpongeBob!

1032
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,445
- Lean!
- Starboard!

1033
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:04,447
- What the...
- What?

1034
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:07,450
"Home of the Krabby Patty"?

1035
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:11,980
But The Krusty Krab
is the home of the Krabby Patty!

1036
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:13,780
Mr. Krabs, what are we gonna do?

1037
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:16,060
$8.99 for a Krabby Patty?

1038
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:19,209
Why didn't I think of that?

1039
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:32,406
You!

1040
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:37,285
Cease and desist
that unauthorized patty flipping!

1041
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:39,020
Yeah, that's my job!

1042
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:40,326
How did you get here?

1043
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:42,770
You cannot breathe air.

1044
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:44,660
Well, there was this magical dolphin

1045
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:46,700
from the future who shot us
out of his blowhole, and...

1046
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,928
Wait! Wait.

1047
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,490
That's not in the book.

1048
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:55,641
Book?

1049
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:58,161
There is no magical dolphin
in this story.

1050
01:04:58,320 --> 01:04:59,810
What story?

1051
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:06,020
The story of how Bikini Bottom
was brought to its knees

1052
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:08,780
when its beloved Krabby Patty formula

1053
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:11,340
was stolen by me,

1054
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:13,010
Burger Beard.

1055
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:15,964
How does it end?

1056
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:18,340
Well, let me see.

1057
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:20,761
It looks like

1058
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:24,700
Burger Beard becomes the richest

1059
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:28,441
food truck proprietor in all the land.

1060
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:30,900
But how did you steal the formula?

1061
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,047
That was easy.

1062
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:36,049
I simply rewrote the story, and...

1063
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:37,207
Poof!

1064
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:39,060
Me formuler!

1065
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:41,242
What do you mean, rewrote the story?

1066
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:42,566
Watch this.

1067
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:45,371
"The brave

1068
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:47,220
"and handsome

1069
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:49,220
"Burger Beard

1070
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:52,460
"banished our poor heroes

1071
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:54,608
"to be stranded on

1072
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:57,002
"Pelican Island!"

1073
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:02,328
"The End"!

1074
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:08,940
This looks bad.

1075
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:10,849
And these guys look hungry!

1076
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:14,166
Look out!

1077
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:22,300
Nice. So this is what teamwork gets you.

1078
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:25,165
Here! Take Squidward, you vile beasts!

1079
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:28,460
I want to be on a new team.
This one's broken.

1080
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:30,483
Sandy, you're smart. You have any ideas?

1081
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:35,768
I ain't been too smart
since I found this old piece of paper!

1082
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:41,083
- What?
- Incoming!

1083
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:50,250
Wait a minute!

1084
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:54,404
Now all we need is some ink!

1085
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:56,326
Which Squidward has helpfully provided.

1086
01:06:57,920 --> 01:06:59,763
It happens when I'm nervous.

1087
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:03,002
Whatever you're going to do,
make it quick!

1088
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:04,660
They're closing in on us!

1089
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:06,250
I'm gonna write us an ending.

1090
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:10,020
Will it be a happy ending?

1091
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:12,600
It's going to be superpowered!

1092
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:24,644
I'll show you a happy ending.

1093
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:43,891
Patrick!

1094
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:47,085
Hey, I got feet!

1095
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,970
What is in these things?

1096
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:55,881
We'll take one secret formula to go!

1097
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,340
Clear the area, citizens.

1098
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:03,330
There's going to be
some serious aft-kicking here.

1099
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:09,529
But I banished you.

1100
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:11,085
Sour Note?

1101
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:21,323
My tiny little eardrums!

1102
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:26,090
Hey, hey, wait! Hold on! Hold on!

1103
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:28,931
Wait! Wait! Customers!

1104
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:31,202
Wait, please!

1105
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:33,444
Mr. Superawesomeness,

1106
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:35,405
take him down.

1107
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:56,043
Maybe we should have picked
a better superpower for you, Patrick.

1108
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:00,880
Let's see you get out of this one!

1109
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:10,890
Get ready for the Invinci-Bubble!

1110
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:15,371
No!

1111
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:16,971
My book!

1112
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:22,020
All right, team,
time for hands in the middle!

1113
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:23,460
Yes!

1114
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:25,210
Oh, yeah.

1115
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:34,003
Great job, guys. We did it!

1116
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:38,540
What?

1117
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:40,927
Sandy? Is that you?

1118
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:44,004
You can call me The Rodent!

1119
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:47,927
Hey, where'd the pirate go?

1120
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:00,610
It looks like Burger Beard

1121
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:03,121
forgot the first rule
of mobile fry cooking.

1122
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:06,280
Always batten down your grease traps.

1123
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:09,761
Follow that grease, team!

1124
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:33,685
There she blows.

1125
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,764
Oh, no, you don't.

1126
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:42,611
He's after the book!

1127
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:45,740
Sandy, use your squirrel powers!

1128
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:46,921
Roger that!

1129
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:54,405
She's never gonna make it!

1130
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:57,820
Everyone...

1131
01:11:57,920 --> 01:11:59,604
Lean!

1132
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:18,011
That's what you get.

1133
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:34,404
Come here.

1134
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:36,220
The book!

1135
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:37,890
Sour Note!

1136
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:56,611
All right, Burger Beard,
prepare to be teamworked!

1137
01:12:56,800 --> 01:13:00,282
I'm going to scrub my armpits with you.

1138
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:02,420
I don't get it.

1139
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:03,931
Because you're a sponge.

1140
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:05,121
Duh.

1141
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:08,210
Get him, The Rodent!

1142
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:09,970
Consider him roasted!

1143
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:32,727
Aw, nuts! I'm all out of nuts!

1144
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:41,846
Justice is best soft served.

1145
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:50,963
Patrick, I should have
never doubted your powers!

1146
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:06,565
I can't think of a sweeter way to go.

1147
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:10,408
It's all mine!

1148
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:13,570
Not so fast, Booger Beard!

1149
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:32,324
Me formuler.

1150
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:35,927
This will make you feel a little butter.

1151
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:39,051
Not melted butter!

1152
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:44,525
Mr. Krabs!

1153
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:05,608
Oh, yeah!

1154
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:32,125
They're beautiful!

1155
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:34,087
Patrick!

1156
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:51,885
I gotcha!

1157
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:53,161
SpongeBob!

1158
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:55,966
- Patrick?
- Talk to me, buddy.

1159
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:58,771
I'm... I'm seeing a bright light.

1160
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:00,644
Is this better?

1161
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:02,460
Much. Thank you.

1162
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:05,580
But the discomfort I feel
in my eyes is nothing

1163
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:09,420
compared to the shame I feel
for letting down the Patty.

1164
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:11,568
For letting down Bikini Bottom.

1165
01:16:11,720 --> 01:16:14,291
Yeah, SpongeBob, you really blew it.

1166
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:17,649
No, Patrick, we blew it, as a team.

1167
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:20,161
Nope. This one's on you.

1168
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:25,851
Where do you think you're going?

1169
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:34,245
Why don't you get going, little fella,
before you hurt yourself?

1170
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:47,406
Plankton?

1171
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:50,042
It's Plank-Ton!

1172
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,731
Come on down from there, little fella.

1173
01:16:55,560 --> 01:16:57,847
You wouldn't want to get hurt.

1174
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:23,689
Come out, come out, wherever you are!

1175
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:27,251
My eye!

1176
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:41,651
He's getting away!

1177
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:47,445
Ready for a Plank-Ton of bubbles?

1178
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:11,603
The formula, please.

1179
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:15,845
Come on. Team up with me.
We'll be rich and powerful!

1180
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:17,121
No, thanks.

1181
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:19,288
I'm already part of a teamwork.

1182
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:45,220
Can we do hands in the middle again?

1183
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:46,540
Yes, we can, Patrick.

1184
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:49,610
But this time, there's one more
hand to go in the middle.

1185
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:53,761
Plankton?

1186
01:18:57,320 --> 01:18:58,765
Oh, no.

1187
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:04,325
Here you go, Krabs.

1188
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:07,020
She's all yours.

1189
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:10,442
This doesn't have
another insulting note in it, does it?

1190
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:12,900
No, that's the old me.

1191
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,401
The one who turned his back
on everything important

1192
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:18,180
just to have that formula
all to himself.

1193
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:22,365
But I realize now that keeping
something to myself is...

1194
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:24,260
Selfish.

1195
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:27,523
Especially when that something
is the Krabby Patty.

1196
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:31,140
Okay, everybody, let's get back
to Bikini Bottom and...

1197
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:33,766
Oh, no! I don't have the page!

1198
01:19:33,880 --> 01:19:34,927
Oh, no!

1199
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:36,530
It must be back on Pelican Island!

1200
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:40,042
Don't worry. I thought of everything.

1201
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:42,891
All right, SpongeBob, take us home.

1202
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:44,087
Thanks.

1203
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:46,500
- Squidward!
- Oh, yeah.

1204
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:50,207
Come on, it's time to go back
and open up The Krusty Krab!

1205
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:52,780
Are you out of your patty-flipping mind?

1206
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:54,060
I'll never leave this place!

1207
01:19:54,160 --> 01:19:57,460
I mean, look at me. I'm a god!

1208
01:19:57,560 --> 01:20:00,086
No, Squidward, you're a cashier.

1209
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:04,763
Wait a minute! What? No!

1210
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:10,970
Well, it was fun while it lasted.

1211
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:13,491
Don't be sad, Squidward.

1212
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:16,291
I left you a little surprise
under your shirt!

1213
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:20,248
Rock-hard abs!

1214
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:24,260
Aw, SpongeBob, you're okay in my book.

1215
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:25,300
Aw, shucks.

1216
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:29,325
Excuse us! We'd like
3,000 Krabby Patties, please!

1217
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:35,963
That sound must mean
things are back to normal.

1218
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:38,651
Who wants 3,000 Krabby Patties?

1219
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:44,580
First one's for you, Gary.

1220
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:46,648
Extra mayo, just the way you like it.

1221
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:51,564
Caught you red-handed!

1222
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:53,420
Gary hates mayo.

1223
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:57,220
Plankton!
Up to your old tricks again already, eh?

1224
01:20:57,320 --> 01:20:59,820
Hey, I'm just putting things
back the way they were.

1225
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:01,729
What do you have
to say about this, Gary?

1226
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:03,761
Oh, shrimp.

1227
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,571
See you later, tee-am-mate!

1228
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:20,807
- Now can we sing it?
- Yeah!

1229
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:25,007
Pwease, Mr. Piwate?

1230
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:27,288
Oh, Kyle...

1231
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:31,484
How can I say no to you?

1232
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:35,220
Are you ready, kids?

1233
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:36,900
- Aye-aye, Captain!
- Aye-aye, Captain!

1234
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,180
What did you say?

1235
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:42,580
There's sand in my ears
and I can't hear you!

1236
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:45,047
- Aye-aye, Captain!
- Aye-aye, Captain!

1237
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:50,540
Who lives in a pineapple under the sea?

1238
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:52,404
SpongeBob SquarePants!

1239
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:54,688
Absorbent and yellow and porous is he!

1240
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:56,529
SpongeBob SquarePants!

1241
01:21:56,680 --> 01:21:58,603
If nautical nonsense
be something you wish

1242
01:21:58,720 --> 01:22:00,484
SpongeBob SquarePants!

1243
01:22:00,640 --> 01:22:02,700
Then drop on the deck
and flop like a fish!

1244
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:04,689
- SpongeBob SquarePants!
- Ready?

1245
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:08,521
SpongeBob SquarePants!

1246
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:10,140
SpongeBob SquarePants!

1247
01:22:10,240 --> 01:22:11,730
Silence!

1248
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:15,740
Oh, man. I like that song.
What happened?

1249
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:18,100
I don't like that song
and I put an end to it.

1250
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:19,540
Well, this music is terrible.

1251
01:22:19,640 --> 01:22:20,971
I suppose you're entitled to your...

1252
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:22,366
Wait. Why am I talking to you?

1253
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:23,846
You're an inferior species

1254
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,460
What could you know about taste?

1255
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:28,340
You get excited by
a pile of trash on a plate

1256
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:31,683
While I'm a spacetime traveler
Fabric unraveler

1257
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:34,740
Saving the Patty's in the past
But now I'm rapping ya

1258
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:37,460
That song's so bad
That I can't even stand it

1259
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:39,180
Dispense with this nonsense at once

1260
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:40,486
I demand it!

1261
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:42,100
You all stand no chance

1262
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:43,620
Against my power
Don't try it

1263
01:22:43,720 --> 01:22:45,140
Just sit there
with your flappy beak shut

1264
01:22:45,240 --> 01:22:46,220
And be quiet!

1265
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:47,481
Hold up, fish guts

1266
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:49,540
- You can't insult us
- The Seagull crew

1267
01:22:49,640 --> 01:22:51,820
We're in no mood to hear... from you!

1268
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:54,844
We're floating on the breeze
Party in seven seas

1269
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:56,380
You got your nose on your head

1270
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:58,244
You blow up when you sneeze

1271
01:22:58,400 --> 01:22:59,460
Why's this guy so mean?

1272
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:01,210
'Cause he's older than a fossil

1273
01:23:01,320 --> 01:23:02,500
All alone up in space

1274
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:04,090
Yeah, that must be awful

1275
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:06,771
Here, knock it off!
Yer making the movie too long!

1276
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,100
Why don't you take us back in time

1277
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:10,089
So we can finish our song?

1278
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:12,525
Fine.

1279
01:23:12,720 --> 01:23:22,482
SpongeBob SquarePants!

1280
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,606
That was pretty good, actually.

1281
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:40,290
Yeah, sorry!

1282
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:06,768
This dance is so last year.

1283
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:35,084
You know what this needs?

1284
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:38,243
A little interpretive dance!

1284
01:24:39,305 --> 01:25:39,435
