652

that they thought
he'd lost his mind.

That the war
was too much for him.

Then the man who cared for him
stopped speaking too.

655
01:20:08,054 --> 01:20:11,683
Their medic had a theory,
before he stopped speaking...

656
01:20:12,767 --> 01:20:15,770
that the virus
that almost wiped us out...

survivor still carries...

dealt with medically.

If they wanted to
relieve me of my command...

706
01:23:10,779 --> 01:23:13,615

meet me here...
