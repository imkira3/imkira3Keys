<i>You in the dinghy!
This is the police.</i>

3
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:33,886
<i>Put your hands on your head.</i>

4
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,362
Mick?

5
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:47,529
G'day, Sarge!

6
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,694
I might have known it would be you.

7
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:54,532
It's these New York fish, Sarge,
they won't take the bait.

8
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,500
Breakfast.

9
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:09,467
Get outta here! Come on, let's go.

10
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:48,294
Mick?

11
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:41,559
Breakfast.

12
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,148
What are you doing
up there? You scared me.

13
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:49,988
Just admiring the view.
You want coffee?

14
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,697
Yeah.

15
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:21,516
- Are you thinking about home?
- Yeah.

16
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,727
- I guess you miss it.
- The bush? A bit.

17
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:29,399
I was thinking I could be sitting in
the bar at Walkabout Creek right now,

18
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:32,531
gazing across at Wally
and Nugget and Donk.

19
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:38,070
Or I could be here looking
at you. No contest.

20
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:42,408
Actually, I was thinking
about looking for a job.

21
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:43,913
You're kidding.

22
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:47,204
No. A man can't stay
on holidays forever.

23
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:51,296
Well, you seem to have
managed okay so far.

24
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:55,966
I would've started looking
for a job last week,

25
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:59,550
only I wanted to see Doug meet
his mysterious twin brother.

26
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:03,186
- Doug who?
- On TV. <i>Days of Our Lives.</i>

27
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:07,604
Oh, Mick! We definitely
have to get you a job!

28
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:18,736
Hey, Mick, my friend didn't see you
throw. Could you show him? Huh?

29
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:20,362
Um...

30
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,664
You can go play.
I've got to go to work.

31
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:23,956
Play?

32
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:28,082
- Don't forget lunch.
- No worries. All right. Wait a minute.

33
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:29,606
- Where's the rabbit?
- Here it is.

34
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:31,126
Yeah. Right. That's a rabbit.

35
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:33,425
You take the rabbit, put it
down over there somewhere

36
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,843
- then get right out of the way.
- Okay.

37
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:36,340
- Rocks?
- Yup.

38
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:37,970
Don't miss, Mick.

39
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:42,930
- Close your eyes!
- All right.

40
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,012
One.

41
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:48,098
Two.

42
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:49,812
Three.

43
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:52,319
Four. Okay, you can look.

44
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,070
Yay!

45
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:01,112
- Any good?
- That was the best, Mick.

46
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:03,204
Know how come he can
throw like that?

47
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,625
In the bushes, if you miss, you don't
eat. Isn't that right, Mick?

48
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:10,959
That's right. But that's only half of it.
First, you gotta find the animals.

49
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,252
Here. What's this?

50
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,636
- A snake. That's a snake trail.
- Quick.

51
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:20,047
Snakes are good eating.

52
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:22,090
What's this one?

53
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:30,057
- That's a goanna, a real big lizard.
- Right.

54
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:33,394
You can eat it, but it tastes
like shit, right, Mick?

55
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,064
Yeah... Here's another
one, real quick.

56
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,947
What's that? Don't know?

57
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,405
Dunlop radials, Tony's bike.

58
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,701
- That was a good one.
- All right, practice.

59
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:51,464
- Bye, Mick. Bye.
- See you later. Bye-bye.

60
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,163
- See you later!
- Bye!

61
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:56,584
- And don't forget lunch!
- That was good, right?

62
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:04,929
- G'day, Al.
- Hiya, Mick.

63
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:08,015
- What'll you have?
- Just a beer, mate.

64
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:13,688
- Mind if I make an announcement?
- Go right ahead.

65
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:15,518
Thanks.

66
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:19,907
Mick Dundee's the name.
Fairly new in town.

67
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,449
Looking for some kind of a job.

68
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:24,319
Any suggestions?

69
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:30,208
That's enough job
hunting for one day.

70
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:32,916
- Yo, Mick, my man!
- G'day, Leroy.

71
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:37,583
- So, like, you're looking for work?
- Hmm. Kinda.

72
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:40,218
Well, then look no further.

73
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:43,927
- I can get you into something sweet.
- Great.

74
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:46,891
Let me just grab some cigarettes,
then we'll talk some business.

75
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:47,968
Okay.

76
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,097
Hey.

77
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:55,434
I noticed you're getting
pretty tight with Leroy.

78
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:56,609
Yeah, nice fella.

79
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:59,817
Let me warn you, he's a bad dude.

80
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,904
He's into some pretty heavy shit.

81
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:06,616
- Leroy? Seems harmless enough.
- Just so you know.

82
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:12,660
Yo, Mick, let's walk.
Less ears on the street.

83
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,913
Okay. Back in a sec.

84
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:32,145
Okay, like... I got a little
supply business going, right?

85
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:37,059
- Hey, like you will work for me.
- Oh. What would I be doing?

86
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:40,403
- Delivering stuff.
- Stuff?

87
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:53,871
This is just between you and me.
This goes no further, right?

88
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,251
Right.

89
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,884
Stationery.

90
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,215
- Stationery?
- Shh!

91
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:12,219
You know, pens, erasers,
office supplies.

92
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:17,982
- And that's heavy shit?
- No, man, it ain't.

93
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,318
I'm strictly legit.

94
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,855
But when you have a
name like Leroy Brown,

95
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:26,316
people expect you to be bad.

96
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,151
You know, like the song.

97
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:30,154
Oh, right!

98
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:32,323
But, uh...

99
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:36,125
- I kinda like the image.
- Yeah.

100
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,462
- You dig?
- Yup. Dig.

101
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,544
Is that part of the job? Digging?

102
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:48,346
Man, you really are prehistoric.
Hey. You want the job?

103
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,884
Well, I don't know, Leroy. Don't
really know what I wanna do yet.

104
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:56,020
Okay. When you make up your
mind, you let me know.

105
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,273
Okay.

106
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,355
In the meantime,

107
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,187
I gotta split.

108
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:09,572
You be cool.

109
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:34,676
Hmm?

110
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,225
Beast. The perfect gift for Donk.

111
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,909
Well, it makes a man irresistible.

112
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,323
Hmm.

113
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,414
You don't sound very
convincing. I think I'll test it.

114
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,353
Doesn't work.

115
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:25,735
Well, it doesn't!

116
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,742
I'd really like to get
Wally the kind of thing

117
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:36,074
you can only buy in
America, you know.

118
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,281
Hello.

119
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:44,830
Maybe like those cushions
that say, "I love New York,"

120
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:46,881
that you put in your car.

121
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,137
Hmm.

122
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:05,684
Hi, Sue. What are you doing?

123
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:09,813
Hi, Doris. Nothing exciting,
just going through some mail.

124
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:15,410
Oh, Bob Tanner. Isn't
he your ex-husband?

125
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:17,203
We still keep in touch.

126
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:20,992
Oh, Sue, he's cute! Where was
I when you two broke up?

127
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:25,503
- I could have consoled him!
- Well, that's gonna be difficult.

128
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:28,916
He spends most of his time
in Colombia these days.

129
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,171
That's where the action is.

130
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:36,389
<i>Qué será, será</i>. Oh, speaking of
action, when am I gonna meet Tarzan?

131
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:40,098
- You mean Mick?
- You have another hot jungle lover?

132
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,348
Soon, I promise.

133
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:45,682
Sue, what's he like in bed?

134
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:49,360
I don't know. He still
sleeps on the floor.

135
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:00,371
Okay, some visitors.

136
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:13,172
This must be Rico.

137
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:20,721
Hello, Rico. Nice suit.

138
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,270
<i>Cómo está?</i>

139
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:30,067
A little slimy, you know.

140
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:36,233
What the hell is this?

141
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,156
Shit!

142
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:49,731
<i>- Operador.</i>
- Hi. This is <i>Señor</i>Tanner in Room 11.

143
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:53,526
Would you get me
<i>Bogotá 6-3-7, please?</i>

144
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:54,644
<i>Si, Señor.</i>

145
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,521
<i>Gracias.</i>

146
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,326
- Hello.
<i>- Your call.</i>

147
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,616
Brannigan.

148
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,414
Brannigan. Look,
something's happened.

149
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:13,212
You gotta get me out of here.
I'm not a cop. I want protection.

150
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:16,003
Okay, Tanner, you'll get it.
Just calm down.

151
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,460
So, what have you got?

152
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:23,465
Rico was at the cocaine plant.

153
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:26,176
Oh yeah, it was him.

154
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,561
And there's more. He
killed a guy, personally.

155
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,058
I took pictures of the whole thing.

156
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,353
Great. Did you send them off?

157
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,523
Yeah, but not to you.

158
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,104
But don't worry, I'll send
you some framed copies.

159
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,030
Where did you send them, Bob?

160
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,782
Yeah, Brannigan. Sure, yeah.

161
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:43,610
I tell you, and you
kiss me goodbye.

162
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:45,115
Read my lips. They shot at me!

163
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:47,314
They already killed one guy!
Now come here and get me!

164
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,286
Yeah. Okay, okay, just stay put.

165
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,925
We'll be there within the hour.
You'll be out on the next flight.

166
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,917
- Great. Good. Great.
<i>- You did a great job.</i>

167
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:58,549
Thank you very much. Bye.
Just come and get me, all right?

168
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:04,422
<i>- Operador.</i>
- Yeah. Hi, it's me again. Yeah.

169
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:06,808
Would you get me New
York City, please?

170
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:09,887
212-555-6432.

171
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,895
<i>- Si, señor. Nueva York.</i>
- Thank you.

172
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,909
Sue, listen...

173
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:35,670
<i>Um, yeah.</i>

174
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:38,874
<i>Hello. This is Mick Dundee here.</i>

175
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,886
<i>I'm not really here, this is a
recording. It's good, isn't it?</i>

176
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,587
<i>Um, Sue's not here either,</i>

177
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,966
<i>and you should leave a
message after the beep.</i>

178
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:52,515
<i>Hey, great message.
Listen, Sue, this is Robert.</i>

179
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:55,644
<i>I just... I sent you a letter.
I don't want you to open it.</i>

180
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:58,567
<i>I don't want you to do anything with
it until you hear from me, all right?</i>

181
00:16:58,643 --> 00:17:02,989
<i>There's nobody else that I trust.
This is big with a capital "B."</i>

182
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,108
Bye.

183
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:33,929
- G'day, Ralph.
- Yo, Mickey. How's it hangin'?

184
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:35,558
Good, mate. Anything for me?

185
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:38,016
Got something here for
your lady friend.

186
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,643
There you go.

187
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:44,814
Hey.

188
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,324
What about this one?

189
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,695
My fellow Americans,

190
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:53,498
let me make one thing
perfectly clear.

191
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:59,671
That's funny, Ralph. Who is it?

192
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:05,294
It's Nixon! You know, Tricky Dicky?

193
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:09,092
No, I don't know him.
Does he live round here?

194
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,051
He used to be the President!

195
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:17,852
Oh, right. Yeah, that was
just like him, Ralph.

196
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:20,517
- I'll work on it.
- See you, mate.

197
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:22,435
See you later, Mick.

198
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,918
Hey, you ugly mother.
Give me your wallet!

199
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,757
Hey, hey, hey. Relax!
It's just me, man.

200
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,921
- Leroy! How are you, mate?
- How you doin'?

201
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:53,841
- Fancy a drink somewhere?
- That sounds good to me.

202
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:55,642
I just got a couple of
deliveries to make.

203
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:57,516
- Can I help?
- Sure, sure.

204
00:18:57,595 --> 00:19:00,519
Look, this goes to Moore,
Bank and Patterson,

205
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:03,272
on the 23rd floor of that
building right there.

206
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:04,811
No worries. See you back here.

207
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:06,942
- Back here in five minutes.
- Got it.

208
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,738
- G'day.
- Yes.

209
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:18,032
Can I help you?

210
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,039
That's your stationery.

211
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:22,999
Can you wait while I check this?

212
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:26,415
Yeah, sure.

213
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:39,141
Hey, there's a guy walking
past your window.

214
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:43,767
- Okay, what's the gag?
- No, serious.

215
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:49,439
Oh, my God. It's a jumper.
I'd better call the police.

216
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:53,485
- It's a what?
- A jumper. A suicide!

217
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:58,114
Maybe I should go and talk to him.

218
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:09,792
Don't try to stop me.

219
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:13,136
I don't want to stop you.
I just wanna get past.

220
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:14,630
What?

221
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:19,476
- I wanna get by. You're in the way.
- You're kidding.

222
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:22,639
No. I walk around here every day.

223
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:24,432
Get away from all the
noise and the traffic,

224
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:26,313
get up here and get the fresh air.

225
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,036
You had the same idea
yourself, did you?

226
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,898
I don't give a damn about the air!

227
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:34,109
I'm about to throw myself
off this building.

228
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:41,658
You could kill yourself.

229
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:44,202
That's the whole idea.

230
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:49,044
Oh. Oh, right. I'll just
wait till you're finished.

231
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:10,110
Would you mind getting a
move on? I'm on my lunch break.

232
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,614
I can't do it with you watching.

233
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,033
Sorry.

234
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,662
Just out of curiosity, why...

235
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:43,804
Have you ever been hopelessly
and completely in love,

236
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:47,018
only to find out that...

237
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:48,808
That you've been used?

238
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:52,729
No, I can't say that I have.

239
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:57,943
I loved that bitch!

240
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:03,535
- It's all right.
- And he betrayed me.

241
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,324
He?

242
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,048
Screw that!

243
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:51,371
Hello, Sue.

244
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:54,753
No, no. No trouble, darling.
Just get into the car, okay?

245
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:15,955
Sit.

246
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:46,405
Sue Charlton.

247
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:49,492
You got something for me?

248
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:52,916
Who are you and what do you want?

249
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:56,245
Forgive me. I am Luis Rico.

250
00:24:57,413 --> 00:25:02,465
Your ex-husband Bob sent you a film.
It belongs to me. I want it back.

251
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:05,755
Bob? I don't know what
you're talking about.

252
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:10,472
This is very simple. We do
business and you go home.

253
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:18,234
He sent you a letter. Where is it?

254
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:22,400
I don't know what
you're talking about.

255
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:28,403
It would be here by now. He left
a message on your machine.

256
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:32,164
I never got any message.
The machine's been broken.

257
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,747
<i>Si</i>

258
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:45,135
Felipe.

259
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:48,339
He says the boyfriend is back.

260
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,968
What do you want him to do?

261
00:25:54,136 --> 00:25:57,231
- His name?
- Mick.

262
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:00,817
He lives with you?

263
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:06,198
- Does he check the mail?
- Yeah, I guess.

264
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:14,828
Tell Felipe to bring Mick
around for a coffee.

265
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:23,586
He says that the DEA,
they staked out the place.

266
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,469
Brannigan just walked
inside the building.

267
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:37,430
Tell him to just sit tight.
This is getting out of hand.

268
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:54,030
Call Mick. And pray
he has some brains.

269
00:26:54,905 --> 00:26:58,034
He does like I tell him,
you both come out alive.

270
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:14,932
Sue?

271
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,154
Just a second.

272
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:39,037
- Yeah?
- Mick.

273
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:40,396
<i>Sue. You should see the joint...</i>

274
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:43,078
Mick, listen, this is really important.
I'm in a lot of trouble.

275
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:45,881
<i>- Did you check the mail today?</i>
- Yeah, why?

276
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:50,089
Was there a letter for
me from Colombia?

277
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:55,762
Hang on a second. Colombia.
Yeah, I got it here.

278
00:27:56,967 --> 00:27:59,436
- Thank God.
<i>- What the hell's going on?</i>

279
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:02,223
- Mick, I'm being held prisoner by...
<i>- You're joking, right?</i>

280
00:28:02,306 --> 00:28:03,603
Shut up and listen.

281
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,733
- Who's this?
- There's no time.

282
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:07,527
There's a cop coming to see you.

283
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:11,608
Give him nothing. Get rid of him,
or your lady is a dead woman.

284
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:13,571
Call you back in two minutes.

285
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,160
Listen...

286
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:30,425
Yeah?

287
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,128
Inspector Brannigan. Drug
Enforcement Administration.

288
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:37,259
- Is Sue Charlton in?
- Not at the moment, no.

289
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:43,313
- When do you expect her?
- I'm not sure.

290
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:46,976
You know these big-time reporters,
out reporting till all hours.

291
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:51,822
Would you ask her to give me a call,
if you happen to bump into her?

292
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,482
Yeah, sure. No problem.

293
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,158
Aren't you gonna ask me
what this is all about?

294
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:57,490
Well, none of my business.

295
00:28:57,653 --> 00:28:59,326
Okay, fine.

296
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:12,334
<i>Yes?</i>

297
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:16,506
Bring the letter to Hoyt
Street station, downtown side.

298
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:19,346
Wait till someone comes.
You got that?

299
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:22,011
<i>Yes. I wanna talk to Sue. Now.</i>

300
00:29:23,804 --> 00:29:26,148
Mick, please do what
they say and be careful.

301
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:28,100
<i>You just hang on.</i>

302
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:30,144
One thing more, <i>amigo</i>.

303
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,985
If you're followed,
if you screw this up,

304
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:38,197
your lady is dead. <i>Comprendes?</i>

305
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:40,328
Yeah, I got it.

306
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:03,598
- What you want? A little mustard?
- Yeah.

307
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:06,722
Ketchup?

308
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:43,493
Okay, here she is.

309
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,617
Mom?

310
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:06,349
- Finished?
- What?

311
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:08,181
- Are you finished?
- Uh-huh.

312
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:10,020
Don't put it away.

313
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:12,939
- Put your hands up on the wall.
- Okay.

314
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:15,725
Now, where's Sue Charlton?

315
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:17,565
Who's that?

316
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:21,607
Lord! Man, no! Ahhh!

317
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:24,284
Look, look, look. How
should I know where she is?

318
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:25,531
I've been following you.

319
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,988
Brannigan told me to
follow you. And that's it.

320
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:30,745
- Brannigan. So you're a cop?
- Yeah, DEA.

321
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:33,706
- Look. Can I do up my fly now?
- No.

322
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,787
- All right.
- What do you want with Sue?

323
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:36,872
Uh...

324
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:39,378
Pictures. We think she's got

325
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:43,466
photographs, pictures of a guy named
Rico. It's evidence, you know.

326
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:47,053
- Who's Rico?
- A big-time drug dealer, he's a killer.

327
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:48,637
Where is he? Where does he live?

328
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:50,344
Wherever he wants to.
How should I know?

329
00:32:50,427 --> 00:32:52,304
Look, I think I've been
more than reasonable

330
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:54,188
under the circumstances,
so what do you say...

331
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:59,646
What do you say you and me just forget this
little incident ever took place, okay?

332
00:33:00,437 --> 00:33:03,281
'Cause it's kind of
embarrassing, you know?

333
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:06,401
He's gone.

334
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:14,785
Are you okay, buddy?

335
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:18,079
Okay.

336
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:50,071
You gotta be Dundee.

337
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:55,121
- Where's the girl?
- Coming in on the next train.

338
00:33:58,954 --> 00:34:01,548
- The item?
- We'll wait.

339
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:39,081
She must have got off
at the wrong stop.

340
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:43,377
No, no, no...

341
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:49,053
Keep going.

342
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:56,849
Now, that's a knife.

343
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:01,437
This is the legendary
New York City subway,

344
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:03,564
completed in nineteen
hundred and...

345
00:35:03,727 --> 00:35:07,231
It's the most extensive
subway system in the world,

346
00:35:07,397 --> 00:35:11,994
encompassing 481.2 rail miles.

347
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:15,246
Yous is free to take pictures.

348
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:17,373
Please get on the train
in an orderly fashion.

349
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:19,622
The next stop will be City Hall.

350
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:22,458
And then on to Staten Island Ferry,

351
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:25,006
which provides service
to World Trade Center.

352
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,251
No, no. Go on. Go on.

353
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:30,220
Yeah.

354
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:36,768
- How does this work?
- Ahhh!

355
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,645
Oh, my God! He's got a gun!

356
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,603
He'll kill somebody, he's crazy!

357
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:45,606
Where are you going?
Come back here! He has a gun!

358
00:35:45,769 --> 00:35:47,897
I'm gonna get into trouble!

359
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:27,185
Shit.

360
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:39,535
- Thank you.
- Slap me five.

361
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:45,795
You know who that was?
Clint Eastwood!

362
00:36:45,954 --> 00:36:47,422
Clint Eastwood?

363
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:51,467
Yes, very tall.

364
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:53,678
So is I.

365
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,722
Yes.

366
00:36:58,299 --> 00:36:59,972
Clint Eastwood.

367
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:06,815
You know what this is?

368
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:09,435
Cocaine.

369
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:12,523
Wrong. It's money and power.

370
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:17,323
With this, you can do
anything to anybody.

371
00:37:19,863 --> 00:37:21,991
Five, 10 years from now,

372
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:26,002
I'm gonna retire, buy
myself a little island.

373
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:28,038
Hawaii, maybe.

374
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,594
Who do you think you are?

375
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:42,602
You hold me here at gunpoint
and threaten to kill people

376
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:45,226
and then you act like you're
some sort of a rock star?

377
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:48,274
You're a drug dealer.

378
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:51,607
Grubby little parasite.

379
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,863
You should watch your mouth.

380
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:02,489
It's not wise to annoy me.

381
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:08,712
Bob Tanner did and I had his
head blown off, like that.

382
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,210
You killed Bob?

383
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:14,050
And if your Mick screws this up...

384
00:39:41,296 --> 00:39:42,548
Wakey, wakey.

385
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:53,851
You kill people for a living.
Not very good at it, are you?

386
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:56,023
Maybe you should get into
some other business.

387
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:57,149
Shove it!

388
00:39:57,687 --> 00:39:59,530
You're too heavy to
be a clever dick.

389
00:39:59,606 --> 00:40:01,606
Who do you think you're
kidding? You ain't gonna...

390
00:40:06,029 --> 00:40:07,451
Scary, eh?

391
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:14,245
Hey, hey.

392
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:17,544
Please! What do you want?

393
00:40:23,046 --> 00:40:25,174
Please! What do you want?

394
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:32,806
- Where's the girl?
- Rico's got her. At his place.

395
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:36,442
And where exactly is that?

396
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:46,493
Hey!

397
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:48,446
Hey!

398
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:59,379
Oh, thank God! I thought you
were gonna leave me here.

399
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:04,050
- Long Island. That's east of here, right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

400
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:07,298
- Thanks.
- Hey!

401
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:09,843
Hey!

402
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:16,566
Freeze! Hold it!

403
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:25,942
Oh!

404
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:29,495
Ah, excuse me.

405
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:38,497
Shall I go after him?

406
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:41,924
- Be my guest.
- Yeah.

407
00:41:55,138 --> 00:41:59,109
Mick, this is serious shit
you're talking about.

408
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:03,609
DEA, international drug rings...

409
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:06,775
This is all hazardous
to your health.

410
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:11,287
Yeah, but think what it'll
do for your reputation.

411
00:42:11,446 --> 00:42:13,039
Oh, yeah! Yeah.

412
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:17,327
Leroy Brown, the baddest man
in the whole damn cemetery!

413
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:23,124
Yeah, but I don't understand
how these people think.

414
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:26,170
I need someone who's road wise.

415
00:42:28,463 --> 00:42:29,965
Road wise.

416
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:40,392
Let's go.

417
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:44,896
The car's... I mean, like,
the wheels are out back.

418
00:42:46,189 --> 00:42:47,691
I'm cool.

419
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:50,530
I'm cool.

420
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:14,050
You mustn't let these minor
disruptions ruin your appetite.

421
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:19,397
Try the lobster. I had it flown
in from Maine this morning.

422
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:23,477
There's nothing wrong with
the food, it's the company.

423
00:43:41,369 --> 00:43:44,373
Would you look at this stuff!

424
00:43:46,249 --> 00:43:48,047
There's TV cameras,

425
00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:51,004
infrared beams!

426
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:55,551
They're gonna know you're
there before you do.

427
00:43:58,052 --> 00:44:00,726
Maybe we should just
call the police.

428
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:03,019
Mick.

429
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,899
Guys like this own cops.

430
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:12,359
And even if the guys you call are
straight, what are they gonna do?

431
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:15,954
Come in here with their sirens
wailing and their guns blazing?

432
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:19,328
She'll be dead in two
seconds, if she's still alive.

433
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:28,166
She's still alive.

434
00:44:29,834 --> 00:44:31,711
How do you know that?

435
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:35,765
'Cause that's the only way
I can see her. Up here.

436
00:44:36,966 --> 00:44:42,939
If I even start to think she's hurt, my
guts twist up, I can't think straight,

437
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:45,065
and I'm no good to her.

438
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:10,837
- So, what do we do now?
- We need some kind of distraction.

439
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:36,527
When we get in, Mick, whatever you do,
be cool, go easy. These dogs bite.

440
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:40,864
Fortunately, they know
my rep round here.

441
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:43,249
I'll just smooth the way.

442
00:46:07,223 --> 00:46:08,941
- Yo, Rat.
- Leroy.

443
00:46:10,226 --> 00:46:14,527
I would consider it a personal
favor if you'll hear my man here.

444
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:22,455
- You're the crocodile man, ain't you?
- Yeah.

445
00:46:23,948 --> 00:46:25,575
I've seen you around.

446
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:31,463
- I'm Rat.
- Hey, Rat.

447
00:46:32,999 --> 00:46:35,377
What do you want, crocodile man?

448
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:38,383
I've got a problem.
I need your help.

449
00:46:39,297 --> 00:46:41,550
Well, you've come
to the right place.

450
00:46:42,258 --> 00:46:44,352
That's what we're here for, huh?

451
00:46:44,427 --> 00:46:45,428
Yeah.

452
00:46:46,554 --> 00:46:48,022
Nice jacket.

453
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:52,772
How can we be of service?

454
00:47:05,114 --> 00:47:09,415
Well, these heavy dudes
kidnapped my woman.

455
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:12,125
They're holding her
prisoner in a big mansion

456
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:13,672
and I'm gonna bust her out.

457
00:47:14,332 --> 00:47:16,050
"Heavy dudes," huh?

458
00:47:16,751 --> 00:47:19,925
Lots of guys with machine
guns, shit like that?

459
00:47:21,589 --> 00:47:22,761
Probably.

460
00:47:23,591 --> 00:47:26,595
So, you want us to charge
down the guns, huh?

461
00:47:27,303 --> 00:47:29,806
Death before dishonor,
all that stuff?

462
00:47:29,889 --> 00:47:31,106
No.

463
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:32,945
I'm the only one that's
gonna get shot at.

464
00:47:35,603 --> 00:47:38,482
What I want from you is a
distraction, so I can get in.

465
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:43,368
So, what's in it for us?

466
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:49,204
Leroy tells me that your gang is
the coolest gang in New York.

467
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:50,604
That's right.

468
00:47:50,785 --> 00:47:52,458
That's the word.

469
00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:59,549
- What did you do last night?
- We didn't do nothin'.

470
00:48:02,338 --> 00:48:04,261
We was here all night.

471
00:48:08,511 --> 00:48:10,934
That's what you call cool, is it?

472
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:20,398
So tomorrow, if someone
asks you the same question,

473
00:48:20,481 --> 00:48:22,984
you can say,
"We didn't do nothin'."

474
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:27,200
Or you can say, "We went
out to Long Island"

475
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:29,824
"and helped this lunatic
storm a fortress."

476
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:42,795
At the very least you could come and
watch me get my head blown off.

477
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:45,096
What are your chances?

478
00:48:47,133 --> 00:48:48,385
Fair.

479
00:48:48,676 --> 00:48:51,850
What are your chances of getting
outta here with that jacket on?

480
00:49:02,398 --> 00:49:03,695
Better than average.

481
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:11,081
Yeah, I'll go along with that.

482
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:21,383
He wants to drive, let him drive!

483
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:25,172
- I didn't think you'd get anybody.
- Would you miss this?

484
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:27,965
- No.
- Exactly.

485
00:49:29,425 --> 00:49:32,395
Hey, yo! Like, be
cool with the clutch!

486
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:38,900
Hey, Judy, what's going on?

487
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:42,905
Looks like these guys are gonna
blow up Long Island or something.

488
00:49:43,063 --> 00:49:46,818
- What the hell, let's check it out!
- Yeah, let's go, man!

489
00:49:50,863 --> 00:49:52,285
Go!

490
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:16,104
Okay, Kemo Sabe. We're set.

491
00:50:16,764 --> 00:50:19,108
It's time for you to do
your Lone Ranger stuff.

492
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,602
Thanks, Rat.

493
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,033
Souvenir.

494
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:00,599
Good luck, Mick.

495
00:51:04,937 --> 00:51:08,487
Hey, Miguel, there is something
going on outside, man.

496
00:51:08,649 --> 00:51:10,947
There is all this weird howling.

497
00:51:19,368 --> 00:51:22,542
They're only kids, punks.
Go get rid of them.

498
00:51:23,956 --> 00:51:27,836
Don't start shooting at shadows.
We don't want the cops around.

499
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:30,846
Do we?

500
00:52:01,994 --> 00:52:03,246
Shit.

501
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:06,006
They don't even have
machine guns, man.

502
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:08,876
Ah!

503
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:18,848
Yeah, like, he's cool.

504
00:53:11,063 --> 00:53:12,815
That's my man!

505
00:53:13,941 --> 00:53:15,784
What's happening here?

506
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:18,954
What's going on here?

507
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:24,372
- I'm in. I'm in. What are we doing?
- What are you, a penguin?

508
00:53:24,535 --> 00:53:26,333
Who are these people?

509
00:53:26,954 --> 00:53:28,080
There he goes.

510
00:53:32,126 --> 00:53:34,470
Damn! He's going in!

511
00:53:35,295 --> 00:53:36,888
Hey. He's going in!

512
00:53:36,964 --> 00:53:38,341
All right!

513
00:54:25,763 --> 00:54:28,186
- What's happening?
- Just some punk kids.

514
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:31,568
- They set off the alarm.
- Check the house anyway.

515
00:55:26,406 --> 00:55:27,783
Mick.

516
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:03,610
- Leroy!
- Hey, Mick!

517
00:56:04,486 --> 00:56:06,659
Thought you might need a hand.

518
00:56:06,822 --> 00:56:09,951
It looks like you've already
taken care of business.

519
00:56:10,117 --> 00:56:11,915
Check out this party!

520
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:16,756
It don't fit.

521
00:56:20,544 --> 00:56:22,296
Where did all these
people come from?

522
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:24,723
Hey, Leroy. You throw
a great party, man.

523
00:56:25,299 --> 00:56:28,303
Better ask Leroy. He's in
charge of the cavalry.

524
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:32,435
It's like, curiosity, my man.

525
00:56:32,848 --> 00:56:35,476
Like, the word gets around,

526
00:56:35,851 --> 00:56:39,901
that bad, bad Leroy Brown
got something going down,

527
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:43,484
they can't stay away.
I mean, with my reputation...

528
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:48,947
Mick, I gotta split.

529
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:52,076
Looks like explanation time.

530
00:56:59,917 --> 00:57:01,260
How do you like your eggs, mate?

531
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:04,304
Over easy. Thanks, Mick.

532
00:57:19,061 --> 00:57:21,439
- Morning, Miss Charlton.
- Morning.

533
00:57:21,605 --> 00:57:25,075
I was assigned to guard
your door. Mick invited me in.

534
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:40,840
- Morning.
- G'day.

535
00:57:40,916 --> 00:57:42,964
Don't you have a post, mister?

536
00:57:43,043 --> 00:57:44,044
Uh...

537
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:45,887
Yes, sir.

538
00:57:47,339 --> 00:57:49,387
Do you mind? I'm starving.

539
00:57:50,092 --> 00:57:51,765
Dig right in.

540
00:57:51,927 --> 00:57:54,646
Got a fork? Thanks.

541
00:57:56,556 --> 00:57:59,230
Well, we haven't found Rico yet.

542
00:58:00,519 --> 00:58:02,192
He'll have skipped
the country by now,

543
00:58:03,939 --> 00:58:05,407
but he'll be back.

544
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:09,160
He has to, you don't walk away
from a $100-million business.

545
00:58:13,073 --> 00:58:15,451
Just how exactly was
Bob involved in this?

546
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:20,998
He owed us a favor.

547
00:58:26,294 --> 00:58:27,637
Here's the photos Bob took.

548
00:58:27,713 --> 00:58:30,182
We can really stir
things up with these.

549
00:58:30,257 --> 00:58:32,385
Rico blew it when he kidnapped you.

550
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:35,437
With your help we can
put him away for keeps.

551
00:58:36,596 --> 00:58:38,394
So what happens now?

552
00:58:38,557 --> 00:58:41,686
The first thing is to put you
two into protective custody.

553
00:58:43,311 --> 00:58:46,906
So we go to jail while
Rico walks around free?

554
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:51,616
No. No, not jail. We'll hide
you away somewhere safe.

555
00:58:51,778 --> 00:58:53,530
You got any ketchup?

556
00:58:54,281 --> 00:58:56,375
Till we get Rico off the streets.

557
00:58:56,450 --> 00:58:58,043
Guys like that should
be just taken out

558
00:58:58,118 --> 00:58:59,210
and shot.

559
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:01,003
Building across the street!

560
00:59:02,497 --> 00:59:04,465
Roof, I think. Go, go! Move it!

561
00:59:08,128 --> 00:59:12,349
- Is this what you call safe custody?
- I didn't expect it to start so soon.

562
00:59:13,133 --> 00:59:16,307
Yeah, well, maybe you can
protect her, but I know I can.

563
00:59:16,470 --> 00:59:19,644
But not here. Somewhere
I can see 'em coming.

564
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:21,854
What have you got in mind?

565
00:59:25,729 --> 00:59:29,029
You see, the Northern
Territory is wilderness.

566
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:36,456
Now, if any of you city folk
went out there and got lost,

567
00:59:37,449 --> 00:59:40,874
you would last about three days.

568
00:59:41,036 --> 00:59:42,333
Gosh!

569
00:59:42,871 --> 00:59:47,297
And you mean you were out there alone
and wounded for 12 days, Mr. Reilly?

570
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:51,012
- Gator.
- No, I wasn't really alone, you see, I...

571
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:53,473
I had old Bessie.

572
00:59:57,677 --> 00:59:59,805
And how is old Bessie, Gator?

573
01:00:00,472 --> 01:00:02,816
Mick! You're back!

574
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:04,147
You're back!

575
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:07,354
- I missed you. I missed you.
- I know.

576
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:10,983
Sue! Sue Charlton.

577
01:00:11,066 --> 01:00:13,444
Now, here's another one of
your fellow countrymen.

578
01:00:13,527 --> 01:00:16,201
She's a brilliant New
York journalist.

579
01:00:16,363 --> 01:00:21,369
She was the one that put Walkabout
Creek on the international scene.

580
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:24,254
Good to see you again, Gator.

581
01:00:24,704 --> 01:00:28,925
- Mick! You old bastard!
- Donk! How are you?

582
01:00:29,084 --> 01:00:32,258
G'day, mate! Bet you've got
some stories to tell, eh?

583
01:00:32,379 --> 01:00:35,758
Have I ever, son. Have I ever.
But not on a dry throat.

584
01:00:35,924 --> 01:00:38,643
- Ida?
- The drinks are on the house.

585
01:00:40,095 --> 01:00:41,768
That's a first!

586
01:00:43,223 --> 01:00:45,476
So what were those New
Yorkers like, Mick?

587
01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:48,779
They were a lot like us,
Nugget. A lot like us.

588
01:00:48,854 --> 01:00:52,779
In fact, I saw Donk's twin
brother over there, in New York,

589
01:00:52,858 --> 01:00:54,075
in the Bronx Zoo.

590
01:00:54,151 --> 01:00:56,074
I don't have a brother.

591
01:00:56,611 --> 01:00:58,363
In a cage, Donk!

592
01:01:00,282 --> 01:01:03,161
- He's still quick, eh?
- Nothing's changed.

593
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:05,624
Son of a bitch!

594
01:01:05,704 --> 01:01:07,547
What's stopping you?

595
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:11,335
- Hey, what's stopping you?
- Donk!

596
01:01:12,169 --> 01:01:13,809
- Cheers, Mick!
- Great to see you, again.

597
01:01:24,264 --> 01:01:25,516
Luis.

598
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:28,692
Jefe.

599
01:01:31,229 --> 01:01:33,231
It's like they jumped off
the face of the planet.

600
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:36,819
Nobody knows nothing,
not even the Feds.

601
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:39,950
Somebody knows.

602
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:43,625
Double the price.
The girl's got to die.

603
01:01:44,910 --> 01:01:48,335
But no one touches
Dundee. He's for me.

604
01:02:38,964 --> 01:02:42,514
Mick, this area we're in now,
does it have a name?

605
01:02:44,344 --> 01:02:45,516
Billongamick.

606
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:49,854
Billongamick. Does
that mean something?

607
01:02:51,351 --> 01:02:52,728
Mick's Place.

608
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:56,944
Okay, why does it mean that?

609
01:02:57,899 --> 01:03:01,028
- Hmm. 'Cause I own it, I guess.
- You own it?

610
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:05,244
Yeah, an uncle of mine
left it to me years ago.

611
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:08,326
How big is Mick's Place?

612
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:13,123
It's not very big. You could walk
across it in three or four days.

613
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:19,721
Three or four days! You can walk
across New York State in two!

614
01:03:21,214 --> 01:03:23,512
Yeah, but this is the Territory.

615
01:03:23,591 --> 01:03:26,515
I mean, anything under 1,000 square
miles up here is a hobby farm.

616
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:31,020
And Mick's Place, it's all
swamps and rocky mountains.

617
01:03:31,308 --> 01:03:34,687
The only thing you can raise
around here are mosquitoes.

618
01:03:34,769 --> 01:03:39,115
Well, I don't care if it is worthless.
I'm glad it's yours, I love it.

619
01:03:41,067 --> 01:03:46,244
I wouldn't say it's worthless. It does
have some redeeming features.

620
01:03:53,413 --> 01:03:55,256
Is this what I think it is?

621
01:03:56,041 --> 01:03:57,759
Tomorrow, when we go
up to my weekender,

622
01:03:57,834 --> 01:03:59,757
I'll show you the Reserve Bank.

623
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:03,974
That's what I call my mine.
It's like my retirement fund.

624
01:04:48,093 --> 01:04:49,310
Hey, Miguel!

625
01:04:53,390 --> 01:04:55,984
It's been a long time, amigo.

626
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:05,368
You look good, Frank.

627
01:05:05,443 --> 01:05:07,992
This is Mr. Rico.
He pays the bills.

628
01:05:08,822 --> 01:05:10,369
How're you doin'?

629
01:05:11,825 --> 01:05:14,795
That's Denning. And
Erskine in the truck.

630
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:19,374
They're good men.

631
01:05:22,252 --> 01:05:24,721
You didn't have to bring
in extra help, Mr. Rico.

632
01:05:24,796 --> 01:05:26,969
Me and my guys can
take care of Dundee.

633
01:05:28,007 --> 01:05:30,601
- You know him?
- I heard of him.

634
01:05:33,221 --> 01:05:36,521
Oh. That's Teddy. He's a tracker.

635
01:05:37,308 --> 01:05:39,731
Dundee went bush about a week ago

636
01:05:39,811 --> 01:05:42,405
and Teddy's the fella that's
gonna help us find him.

637
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:45,654
The fella you're looking for,
would that be Mick Dundee?

638
01:05:45,733 --> 01:05:47,451
Yeah, so what?

639
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:54,872
For you.

640
01:06:03,376 --> 01:06:05,049
Where's he going?

641
01:06:06,212 --> 01:06:07,964
I don't know.

642
01:06:08,047 --> 01:06:10,049
Denning, bring him back!

643
01:06:13,052 --> 01:06:14,599
Come back!

644
01:06:31,112 --> 01:06:32,489
He's gone!

645
01:06:34,782 --> 01:06:36,159
Shit!

646
01:06:37,911 --> 01:06:39,208
This holds us up, no?

647
01:06:39,621 --> 01:06:41,373
Nah. No worries, Mr. Rico.

648
01:06:41,456 --> 01:06:44,380
Maybe just a day or two till
we pick us up another tracker.

649
01:06:44,959 --> 01:06:46,381
What?

650
01:06:52,175 --> 01:06:53,472
There's a quicker way.

651
01:07:32,966 --> 01:07:35,389
This is the luxury holiday house?

652
01:07:36,427 --> 01:07:37,599
Yeah.

653
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:47,985
- View's pretty good.
- Yeah, it's not bad.

654
01:07:48,147 --> 01:07:51,071
Probably double the
value of this place.

655
01:07:51,234 --> 01:07:53,487
That'd be $200,

656
01:07:54,946 --> 01:07:57,369
$300, minimum.

657
01:07:58,533 --> 01:08:01,662
Well, you're the only one
I've ever brought here.

658
01:08:18,970 --> 01:08:21,769
I'm so lucky to have
a rich man like you.

659
01:08:37,905 --> 01:08:39,532
What is it?

660
01:08:46,372 --> 01:08:48,795
I think you'd better come with me.

661
01:09:16,235 --> 01:09:17,578
Don't...

662
01:09:20,406 --> 01:09:21,783
Dundee!

663
01:09:24,202 --> 01:09:27,081
I know you're up there. Come down,

664
01:09:27,622 --> 01:09:29,590
or I shoot your friend.

665
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:52,446
Shoot the dopey bastard!

666
01:10:12,583 --> 01:10:14,085
You shot Walter!

667
01:10:14,252 --> 01:10:17,677
Yeah. It was all I could
think of to save his life.

668
01:10:17,839 --> 01:10:20,592
- By shooting him?
- I only nicked him.

669
01:10:57,003 --> 01:11:00,098
Now we're all on foot.
That makes us even.

670
01:11:00,173 --> 01:11:02,016
Seven to two is even?

671
01:11:28,701 --> 01:11:30,499
I thought you two were mates.

672
01:11:32,413 --> 01:11:33,756
So did I.

673
01:11:37,376 --> 01:11:39,754
Garcia, kill him.

674
01:12:02,276 --> 01:12:03,653
Wait.

675
01:12:07,114 --> 01:12:09,287
Why would Dundee want you dead?

676
01:12:15,414 --> 01:12:16,711
You know this country?

677
01:12:20,086 --> 01:12:23,932
Well, of course, you see...

678
01:12:24,924 --> 01:12:28,770
That's his backyard, up there.

679
01:12:28,928 --> 01:12:33,855
And no man alive knows
this place better.

680
01:12:35,101 --> 01:12:37,945
Except perhaps me. I'm sorry.

681
01:12:41,065 --> 01:12:42,533
So he shot his best mate?

682
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:46,620
What a bastard.

683
01:12:50,116 --> 01:12:52,084
This man thinks like me.

684
01:12:53,953 --> 01:12:56,331
Garcia, let him go.

685
01:13:08,259 --> 01:13:09,636
You stay up front.

686
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:12,350
Let's go.

687
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:44,094
Yeah, that's what I'm looking for.

688
01:13:48,591 --> 01:13:50,764
Looks like they've found the shack.

689
01:13:50,843 --> 01:13:53,312
- You think they'll find us?
- Should do.

690
01:13:54,096 --> 01:13:56,815
I left a trail even
Wally could follow.

691
01:14:05,066 --> 01:14:08,696
- Take your bra off.
- This is hardly the time!

692
01:15:09,255 --> 01:15:12,054
Hey! Look at this!

693
01:16:07,313 --> 01:16:08,565
You've lost 'em.

694
01:16:09,982 --> 01:16:12,861
- You still know how to shoot.
- Yeah, that was great.

695
01:16:22,870 --> 01:16:25,293
If he moves, kill him.

696
01:16:44,725 --> 01:16:47,854
Mick, the gun's empty.
There's no more bullets.

697
01:16:48,813 --> 01:16:52,568
But he doesn't know that. Not
much you can do about it anyway.

698
01:16:53,484 --> 01:16:55,612
Be back soon. I'll check on Wally.

699
01:16:56,028 --> 01:16:57,325
Do you know where they are?

700
01:16:58,864 --> 01:17:00,161
Yeah.

701
01:17:00,616 --> 01:17:03,540
About 500 yards that
way, behind that ridge.

702
01:17:05,913 --> 01:17:07,165
How do you know that?

703
01:17:09,208 --> 01:17:10,926
Can't you smell it?

704
01:17:12,962 --> 01:17:14,214
Their sweat?

705
01:17:15,172 --> 01:17:16,970
Wally's aftershave.

706
01:17:32,439 --> 01:17:34,237
Where are you going?

707
01:17:35,568 --> 01:17:38,367
We're camping. Do you
want coffee or not?

708
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:10,853
- Come on!
- I'm coming! I'm coming! I'm coming!

709
01:18:16,650 --> 01:18:17,776
Garcia!

710
01:18:19,195 --> 01:18:21,289
- What's happened?
- Crocodile.

711
01:18:22,948 --> 01:18:24,495
You're joking.

712
01:18:25,576 --> 01:18:26,623
Yeah.

713
01:18:27,328 --> 01:18:30,127
Yeah, it's a croc. Big one.

714
01:18:31,999 --> 01:18:33,626
16 feet.

715
01:18:34,627 --> 01:18:37,756
See where he knelt
to fill his canteen.

716
01:18:38,464 --> 01:18:41,138
You think he was taken
by <i>un cocodrilo</i>?

717
01:18:42,968 --> 01:18:47,144
Well, you could put
it like that, yes.

718
01:18:57,983 --> 01:18:59,155
Look!

719
01:19:14,625 --> 01:19:16,923
There's nothing we can do here.

720
01:19:21,382 --> 01:19:23,350
You, get some water.

721
01:19:24,176 --> 01:19:25,519
- Jose.
- Huh?

722
01:19:26,512 --> 01:19:28,105
Stay with him.

723
01:20:08,721 --> 01:20:10,314
What's that?

724
01:20:10,389 --> 01:20:13,438
I'm gonna make a telephone
call. See who's about.

725
01:20:14,518 --> 01:20:17,021
I think we're gonna need some help.

726
01:20:17,563 --> 01:20:21,238
- Wanna give me a hand?
- Would Bonnie say no to Clyde?

727
01:20:22,401 --> 01:20:23,573
Who?

728
01:20:38,417 --> 01:20:40,215
Ah. That's the tree.

729
01:20:50,346 --> 01:20:51,518
There's the bats.

730
01:20:58,270 --> 01:21:02,275
Fill this up with those berries.
I'll be up on top of the ridge.

731
01:22:39,246 --> 01:22:41,169
What the hell is that?

732
01:22:41,331 --> 01:22:42,332
Ah.

733
01:22:42,416 --> 01:22:46,421
That is the mating call
of the jarra jarra bird.

734
01:22:46,587 --> 01:22:50,558
It's a very large native
bird, it's very rare.

735
01:22:51,258 --> 01:22:52,680
Ah. Meat eater.

736
01:22:53,552 --> 01:22:56,396
Has been known to take
small children away.

737
01:22:57,222 --> 01:23:00,317
But don't worry, it won't
come near the fire.

738
01:23:11,945 --> 01:23:13,071
Mick.

739
01:23:13,739 --> 01:23:16,959
Thank God you're back.
Did you hear that noise?

740
01:23:17,117 --> 01:23:18,494
What noise?

741
01:23:18,577 --> 01:23:21,581
I don't know. I never
heard anything like it.

742
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:23,457
Oh. Wind, maybe.

743
01:23:26,084 --> 01:23:27,757
What's in the bag?

744
01:23:29,254 --> 01:23:30,881
A little present.

745
01:23:54,947 --> 01:23:56,119
Smell.

746
01:23:57,032 --> 01:23:58,033
Oh.

747
01:23:58,534 --> 01:24:01,128
It stinks! Is it gonna work?

748
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:05,670
Oh, yeah. To a bat, this is
like that Channel No. 5.

749
01:24:10,003 --> 01:24:11,971
I'll be back for dinner.

750
01:24:13,507 --> 01:24:15,601
Keep an eye on the kids.

751
01:24:25,143 --> 01:24:28,147
Listen, boys, you should
be nice for the lady.

752
01:24:28,897 --> 01:24:32,367
She's not here to guard you,
she's here to protect you.

753
01:24:32,776 --> 01:24:35,404
You see, you two aren't the only

754
01:24:36,822 --> 01:24:39,325
crawler nasties in this place.

755
01:25:45,557 --> 01:25:46,854
Dundee.

756
01:25:48,894 --> 01:25:50,737
Tell me about him.

757
01:25:54,566 --> 01:25:59,914
Well, there are bushmen
and there's Mick Dundee.

758
01:26:02,366 --> 01:26:08,294
See, he's more like an
Aborigine than a white man.

759
01:26:09,289 --> 01:26:12,088
He was adopted by Aborigines,

760
01:26:12,834 --> 01:26:15,758
and he had to go through
that initiation.

761
01:26:16,797 --> 01:26:19,926
He knows about their magic.

762
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:26,061
Their black magic.

763
01:26:29,935 --> 01:26:33,360
You know, some people say

764
01:26:35,065 --> 01:26:37,443
that he talks to the animals.

765
01:26:40,987 --> 01:26:43,240
The Aborigines call him

766
01:26:44,658 --> 01:26:47,628
Jabajada Arderdah, which means,

767
01:26:48,745 --> 01:26:53,171
"The crocodile who
walks like a man."

768
01:26:58,964 --> 01:27:03,811
if what you say is true, it's
lucky we brought the Kryptonite.

769
01:27:29,745 --> 01:27:31,372
Look at that!

770
01:27:49,347 --> 01:27:50,348
Ahhh! Ahhh!

771
01:27:54,352 --> 01:27:55,353
Ahhh!

772
01:28:03,445 --> 01:28:04,446
Ugh.

773
01:28:25,675 --> 01:28:27,222
Get some sleep.

774
01:28:29,429 --> 01:28:32,808
- Gonna be a long day tomorrow.
- Yeah.

775
01:28:34,434 --> 01:28:36,732
Gonna be a long night, too.

776
01:29:00,585 --> 01:29:02,212
Quick hands.

777
01:29:04,714 --> 01:29:06,432
Shit!

778
01:29:09,970 --> 01:29:13,099
- What is it?
- A snake. A bloody big snake.

779
01:29:13,265 --> 01:29:15,313
It's just a python, you big girl.

780
01:29:15,475 --> 01:29:18,194
Yeah, well, see how you like it if
someone comes running out of the dark

781
01:29:18,270 --> 01:29:19,817
and throws one at you.

782
01:29:20,689 --> 01:29:25,115
- Dundee was here, in the camp?
- Yeah. He ran straight through.

783
01:29:25,443 --> 01:29:27,946
And you didn't even get a shot off?

784
01:29:29,531 --> 01:29:31,750
Well, he came out of nowhere.

785
01:29:34,953 --> 01:29:37,456
And he moved like lightning, and...

786
01:29:39,624 --> 01:29:41,592
And there was no sound.

787
01:29:42,627 --> 01:29:44,470
No sound at all.

788
01:29:48,258 --> 01:29:51,137
Dundee's some sort of
a ghost or something.

789
01:29:51,636 --> 01:29:54,936
This Dundee likes to
play games, Miguel.

790
01:29:57,183 --> 01:30:00,778
Maybe we teach him some good
games when it gets light.

791
01:30:16,786 --> 01:30:18,663
Come on, Jose, get up.

792
01:30:26,671 --> 01:30:30,596
I told you. Black magic.

793
01:30:33,678 --> 01:30:35,146
Crap magic.

794
01:30:36,014 --> 01:30:38,142
Sweep the area, and stick together.

795
01:30:45,815 --> 01:30:47,192
You!

796
01:30:49,527 --> 01:30:52,121
He didn't fly in
here and take Jose.

797
01:30:54,032 --> 01:30:56,376
There must be tracks. Find them.

798
01:31:08,380 --> 01:31:09,381
Hey.

799
01:31:10,382 --> 01:31:12,555
You thinking what I'm thinking?

800
01:31:12,634 --> 01:31:15,183
We're headed in the
right direction, mate.

801
01:31:15,553 --> 01:31:17,976
- Let's get the hell out of this.
- You got it.

802
01:31:46,584 --> 01:31:48,086
Jaba Point?

803
01:31:50,005 --> 01:31:53,430
You want me to lead
them to Jaba Point?

804
01:31:55,093 --> 01:31:56,310
Got it.

805
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:04,561
Oh.

806
01:32:06,771 --> 01:32:08,239
I got it.

807
01:32:10,525 --> 01:32:11,777
Okay.

808
01:32:14,446 --> 01:32:19,452
Well, I think we'd better get the
others, now I know where he's headed.

809
01:32:20,201 --> 01:32:23,751
Jaba Point, because there's
fresh water there and caves.

810
01:32:26,833 --> 01:32:28,301
What makes you so sure?

811
01:32:29,294 --> 01:32:33,049
Because I understand
how the bastard thinks.

812
01:32:34,132 --> 01:32:35,600
I taught him.

813
01:32:40,597 --> 01:32:42,474
And now I owe him one.

814
01:32:46,061 --> 01:32:47,483
We'll see.

815
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:50,482
You stay in front of me,

816
01:32:51,649 --> 01:32:53,617
- bushman.
- Okay.

817
01:33:22,972 --> 01:33:27,102
- How are you holding up, soldier?
- Tired. A little scared.

818
01:33:27,644 --> 01:33:29,738
But I wouldn't have
missed it for the world.

819
01:33:29,813 --> 01:33:31,190
Fun, isn't it?

820
01:33:31,272 --> 01:33:33,024
- Fun?
- Yeah.

821
01:33:39,531 --> 01:33:43,035
Now you can get some sleep.
Relief watch has arrived.

822
01:33:47,622 --> 01:33:49,875
- Charlie, thanks for coming, mate.
- Hello, Mick.

823
01:33:50,542 --> 01:33:51,794
Telephone call.

824
01:33:52,460 --> 01:33:54,758
Sue, this is Charlie.

825
01:33:55,755 --> 01:33:57,177
And Diamond.

826
01:33:58,216 --> 01:34:00,469
Crikey, Diamond, you
must have a tapeworm!

827
01:34:00,552 --> 01:34:02,930
Every time I see you, you've
got food in your hand.

828
01:34:06,724 --> 01:34:09,227
We've been here since first light.

829
01:34:09,310 --> 01:34:13,440
The two brothers are over there,
looking out for them other fellas.

830
01:34:13,606 --> 01:34:16,780
You keep an eye on this lot.
I'm gonna go after Wally.

831
01:34:16,943 --> 01:34:18,445
Okay, mate.

832
01:34:23,741 --> 01:34:25,209
Can I help?

833
01:34:25,952 --> 01:34:28,330
Well, I really wanted
to get ahead of Wally.

834
01:34:28,413 --> 01:34:31,462
I know, a sheila would
only slow you down.

835
01:34:32,333 --> 01:34:33,334
Mick.

836
01:34:34,460 --> 01:34:36,133
Be careful. This isn't a game.

837
01:34:37,964 --> 01:34:39,216
It is to me.

838
01:35:02,280 --> 01:35:04,908
No, mate. We just hold them.

839
01:35:07,619 --> 01:35:08,791
What did he say?

840
01:35:10,663 --> 01:35:13,132
He wants to know if we're
allowed to eat these men.

841
01:35:34,896 --> 01:35:38,366
We made the right decision,
mate. Stuff the money.

842
01:35:38,650 --> 01:35:42,325
Yeah, I've had a bad
feeling about this

843
01:35:42,403 --> 01:35:44,656
ever since that old black
tracker walked off.

844
01:35:46,032 --> 01:35:49,912
You know, I thought that greaser
really did turn into a goanna.

845
01:35:53,957 --> 01:35:54,958
Erskine?

846
01:35:58,461 --> 01:35:59,883
Erskine?

847
01:36:03,716 --> 01:36:05,434
Don't fool around.

848
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:07,012
Erskine!

849
01:36:28,616 --> 01:36:31,836
He's headed for Jaba
Point, that's for sure.

850
01:36:32,245 --> 01:36:35,419
We cross here. You lead the
way, amigo, we'll cover you.

851
01:36:36,708 --> 01:36:37,925
Yeah.

852
01:37:19,792 --> 01:37:22,045
We don't need him now, anyway.

853
01:37:22,837 --> 01:37:24,805
He's already shown us
the way to Jaba Point.

854
01:37:28,718 --> 01:37:30,595
We'll cross over here.

855
01:37:46,861 --> 01:37:48,784
I knew it was you all the time.

856
01:37:49,447 --> 01:37:52,701
First you shoot my head,
now you try to drown me.

857
01:37:52,784 --> 01:37:55,958
- You've been hit.
- It's only a scratch, mate.

858
01:37:57,497 --> 01:37:58,937
Listen, don't put
that in the water,

859
01:37:58,956 --> 01:38:00,676
'cause there might be
real crocs down there.

860
01:38:00,708 --> 01:38:02,676
Where do you think
I got this fella?

861
01:38:03,836 --> 01:38:05,258
In here.

862
01:38:08,966 --> 01:38:12,186
- Should have seen your face, Wal.
- What was the matter with it?

863
01:38:12,345 --> 01:38:13,813
- You shit yourself.
- I did not!

864
01:38:13,888 --> 01:38:15,231
- Yes, you did.
- No, I did not.

865
01:38:15,306 --> 01:38:17,729
- You didn't know it was me.
- Yeah, I did!

866
01:38:34,659 --> 01:38:36,377
G'day. Want a cold one?

867
01:38:37,495 --> 01:38:39,873
- Who the hell are you?
- Call me Nugget.

868
01:38:40,331 --> 01:38:41,771
I've been looking
for Walter Reilly.

869
01:38:44,419 --> 01:38:46,012
Haven't seen him around, have you?

870
01:38:47,672 --> 01:38:49,712
You should have brought a
gun instead of beer, mate.

871
01:38:50,842 --> 01:38:54,392
Nah, I don't need a
gun. I've got a Donk.

872
01:38:59,058 --> 01:39:00,776
You've got a what?

873
01:39:03,354 --> 01:39:04,526
Donk.

874
01:39:25,209 --> 01:39:27,712
Walter! Over here!

875
01:39:28,379 --> 01:39:33,601
There you are! I was just making
sure that nobody followed me.

876
01:39:33,759 --> 01:39:37,229
- How'd you get away?
- Well, it was a piece of cake really.

877
01:39:37,388 --> 01:39:42,064
It was just a question of timing,
'cause Mick and I had this plan.

878
01:39:42,810 --> 01:39:44,611
- You've been shot again.
- No, that's Mick's.

879
01:39:44,770 --> 01:39:46,397
- What?
- No...

880
01:39:46,481 --> 01:39:48,529
He's all right.
It's just a scratch.

881
01:39:48,608 --> 01:39:49,655
Where is he?

882
01:39:49,734 --> 01:39:53,455
He's leading those other two
mongrels up to Jaba Point.

883
01:39:53,779 --> 01:39:55,531
That's mountain goat country,

884
01:39:55,615 --> 01:40:00,416
so he's gonna have a
picnic with those two!

885
01:40:03,414 --> 01:40:05,963
Sue, what are you doing?
Mick told us to wait here.

886
01:40:06,042 --> 01:40:09,512
Mick thinks this is some big game.
Rico didn't come here for a picnic.

887
01:40:09,587 --> 01:40:10,679
Which way is it?

888
01:40:14,592 --> 01:40:17,095
Well, I'll have to go with you.

889
01:40:28,940 --> 01:40:31,944
Are you really enjoying that?

890
01:40:34,612 --> 01:40:36,580
Nah. Needs garlic.

891
01:41:16,362 --> 01:41:19,536
It's time we stopped playing
this bushman's game his way.

892
01:41:20,825 --> 01:41:22,498
What do you mean?

893
01:41:25,997 --> 01:41:28,841
This man can take us
anytime he wants to.

894
01:41:30,918 --> 01:41:32,044
No.

895
01:41:33,170 --> 01:41:34,513
Now we finish it.

896
01:41:35,506 --> 01:41:38,510
Think! When we were children,

897
01:41:39,468 --> 01:41:42,062
did you chase a snake
into the cane fields?

898
01:41:46,851 --> 01:41:49,024
Move to those rocks and wait.

899
01:43:52,643 --> 01:43:54,145
G'day, <i>amigo</i>.

900
01:44:04,530 --> 01:44:06,328
Take your pants off.

901
01:44:50,659 --> 01:44:52,286
He's got Mick!

902
01:45:15,684 --> 01:45:17,186
Mick.

903
01:45:56,350 --> 01:45:57,693
If Mick want his clothes back,

904
01:45:57,768 --> 01:46:00,396
he can climb down there and
get it his bloody self.

905
01:46:02,857 --> 01:46:04,074
What?

906
01:46:08,612 --> 01:46:10,159
Mick's clothes.

907
01:46:11,407 --> 01:46:15,287
We swapped it with that bastard,
so we can flush the other fella out.

908
01:46:15,452 --> 01:46:17,955
Plan was working till you
turned up and shot Mick.

909
01:46:25,629 --> 01:46:27,927
That's not Mick?

910
01:46:31,135 --> 01:46:34,605
'Course not.
There's Mick over there.

911
01:47:04,168 --> 01:47:06,796
Mick's bloody lucky you
can't shoot straight, Wal.

912
01:47:15,804 --> 01:47:17,772
You ready to go home now?

913
01:47:17,848 --> 01:47:19,270
I am home.

914
01:47:20,305 --> 01:48:20,874
