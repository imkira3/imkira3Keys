all over the place now.

172
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:04,417
Please. The idea of the Purge
was analyzed for years.

173
00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:06,953
We allowed island citizens
to vote on participation.

- They voted yes.
- Yeah, and you know why?

175
00:08:09,124 --> 00:08:11,458
Because a lot of those people
felt coerced by the fact

176
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,260
they don't have money
and you're offering money.

receive payment.

00:08:20,369 --> 00:08:22,269
You know, I'm gonna turn
to you, Dr. Updale.

182
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,937
You are the behavioral
scientist

183
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:26,240
who actually came up
with this whole experiment.

184
00:08:26,242 --> 00:08:29,143
A lot of people have
a lot of concerns about this,

185
00:08:29,145 --> 00:08:31,211
and one concern comes up
over and over again.

186
00:08:31,213 --> 00:08:32,480
I want the truth from you.

187
00:08:32,482 --> 00:08:35,583
Is the Purge
a political device?

188
00:08:35,585 --> 00:08:37,885
I do not work for the NFFA.

189
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:41,055
I did not conceive
of the experiment for them.

190
00:08:41,057 --> 00:08:43,291
The NFFA had the courage
to test it,

191
00:08:43,293 --> 00:08:45,527
but the conceit
is not a political one.

192
00:08:45,529 --> 00:08:47,529
It is a psychological one.

193
00:08:47,531 --> 00:08:50,998
The benefit of acting violently
without worry of consequence,

194
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,300
- that's a freeing violence.
- "A freeing violence."

195
00:08:53,302 --> 00:08:54,637
Okay, that's a...
that's a new one on me.

196
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:56,037
I have a question for you.

197
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:58,006
What is your definition
of success?

198
00:08:58,008 --> 00:08:59,908
Well, the level
of participation

199
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,209
in certain areas is key.

200
00:09:01,211 --> 00:09:03,044
Uh, the Park Hill Towers,
for example,

201
00:09:03,046 --> 00:09:05,380
are the center
of this community.

202
00:09:05,382 --> 00:09:06,981
If there's considerable
participation there,

203
00:09:06,983 --> 00:09:08,350
I think that'll be
a strong indication

204

are already clearing,

209

210
00:09:24,067 --> 00:09:25,568

was monetary gain.

people do during Purge night.

I care about what you all do.

You get hurt or you die,
I lose money.

323
00:13:53,511 --> 00:13:55,978
- And I don't lose money.
- Word. Word.

324
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:58,682
- And we got enemies, right?
- Yeah, true.

325
00:13:58,684 --> 00:14:00,917
Niggas might use the night
to make a move on us.

326
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:03,519
Maybe the police
might use the night

to take out motherfuckers
like us.

329

Point is, we gotta
be prepared for anything.

330
00:14:09,627 --> 00:14:11,794
So we lay low.

331
00:14:11,796 --> 00:14:14,263
We stay inside, and we protect

332
00:14:14,265 --> 00:14:15,966

Yo, D. We should all
just go to Brooklyn.

So we don't even take a chance.

Nah.
Nah, we can't move our money

338
00:14:29,415 --> 00:14:31,381
or our stash off the island.
It's too risky.

going on all over the city.

inside a private office.

1288
00:59:43,732 --> 00:59:45,299
I tracked those trucks
all the way

1289
00:59:45,301 --> 00:59:46,533
across the island to here:

1290
00:59:46,535 --> 00:59:47,802
a remote area
of abandoned factories.

1291
00:59:47,804 --> 00:59:49,637
Watch this now.

1292
00:59:49,639 --> 00:59:52,141
At around midnight,
something strange happens.

1293
00:59:57,379 --> 00:59:59,179
I did a vehicle search
on all systems,

1294
00:59:59,181 --> 01:00:01,815
and every one of these vehicles
ended up in Park Hill,

1295
01:00:01,817 --> 01:00:03,317
Mariners Harbor and Stapleton.

1296
01:00:03,319 --> 01:00:04,751
The low-income areas
of the island.

1297
01:00:04,753 --> 01:00:06,553
And they're attacking
crowded places:

1298
01:00:06,555 --> 01:00:09,390
churches, apartment buildings,
Purge parties.

1299

The gangs know
where people are gathering

1300
01:00:11,261 --> 01:00:12,594
because of
the tracking implants.

1301
01:00:12,596 --> 01:00:14,496
How would gangs know
how to monitor

1302

hunting people down
using the tracking implants.

1310

You're making it look
like people are participating

1311

enough purging.
