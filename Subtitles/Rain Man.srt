30
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:09,480
I spoke to Mr. Babbitt on
that just this morning.

31
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:11,732
I'm still sitting on
four Lamborghinis

32
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,234
that can't make the smog
emission standards.

33
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:15,528
Now, how many times you
wash out with EPA?

34
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:18,781
Yes, they're finally clearing EPA.
Just one or two more days.

35
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:21,283
Three times? We're really
on a roll here, my friend.

36
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:23,953
Four cars, three times each.
That's zip for 12.

37
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:25,663
What are you? A mechanic
or a NASA engineer?

38
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:28,791
Now, listen. I told you I've never
dealt with these Lamborghinis before,

39
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:32,128
and yet you assured me that you could
deliver these cars within that time frame.

40
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:34,588
Don't tell me that, 'cause
I'm not even listening.

41
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,799
Well, sir, I hardly
think that's necessary.

42
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,510
Well, I'll explain that to my swing loan.
I'm sure he'll be very sympathetic.

43
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:42,471
I'm into him for 200,000. That's
thousand, my friend, three zeros.

44
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,931
I got all my money
tied up in these cars,

45
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,182
and if I don't get my money out,

46
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:47,643
I am over, I am finished.
Do you understand that?

47
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,603
You have to understand
our situation here.

48
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:52,523
I don't give a shit about your problems.
I got a shark snapping at my heels here.

49
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:54,942
They could've taken the car
and my business 11 days ago.

50
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,152
They're collateral,
for Christ's sake.

51
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:57,570
Got to hold 'em off with
a whip and a chair here.

52
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:00,322
I understand that, I know
delivery is way overdue.

53
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:01,907
Fuckin' EPA...

54
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,325
Whole world is choking on smog,

55
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:04,452
and they're gonna
correct the situation

56
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:05,995
by keeping my four
cars off the road?

57
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,582
Babbitt Collectibles.

58
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,668
Have you tried cash? How much can
one of these EPA guys earn in a week?

59
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,587
Charlie, it's Wyatt.

60
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:15,713
- Wyatt?
- Yeah.

61
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:16,839
About the swing loan.

62
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,549
If he doesn't get
the money by 5:30,

63
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,342
he's gonna come and
seize all the cars.

64
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,677
I'm gonna have to call you back.

65
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,512
I really think you should
talk to Mr. Babbitt on this.

66
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,514
Tell him that you don't understand.
I signed a check on Tuesday,

67
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:28,434
you personally watched me sign it, and
then you gave it to the mail girl.

68
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:29,685
Come on! I need this!

69
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:30,853
Come on!

70
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:33,773
I wouldn't do that, sir, until you
talk to Mr. Babbitt personally.

71
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:36,525
A number for him? No,
he's on the road just now.

72
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,527
- He wants you to call him immediately.
- Charlie.

73
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:39,779
Just tell him I'm
connecting to Barbados,

74
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,405
arriving 1:30 a.m.,
can he leave a number?

75
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:42,698
- Charlie!
- What, Lenny?

76
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:43,949
I'm standing here.
Talk to me, talk to me.

77
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,869
Mr. Bateman wants to back out on his car
and he wants to take Mr. Webb with him.

78
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,662
They want their down payments back.

79
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:51,081
They found two cars at Valley Motors,
and they want to go that way.

80
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:53,042
Tell him that was me
on the other line,

81
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:54,502
that the cars just
passed emissions,

82
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:56,420
that the EPA paperwork will
be in here momentarily...

83
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:59,673
- You paying attention, Lenny?
- Yeah, I am, I'm listening.

84
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,926
Tell them also that I'm knocking
off five grand on both their deals

85
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:03,010
because I appreciate
their patience.

86
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:04,804
- Now, do you understand that?
- I understand that, I've got it.

87
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:07,027
- Are you sure that you've got that?
- I got it.

88
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,310
Mr. Bateman, that was
Mr. Babbitt on the other line.

89
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,355
As it happens, the cars
are passing emissions...

90
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:16,899
What am I saying? The cars
have passed emissions.

91
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,402
We're just waiting for the EPA paperwork.
We'll have that momentarily.

92
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:23,113
And because of your
incredible patience,

93
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:28,285
we're going to knock off
$5,000 on each car.

94
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,746
Well, yes, you've
been most patient.

95
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:33,374
We really appreciate your patience.

96
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,251
Well, thank you.

97
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:37,395
Thank you.

98
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:40,881
Ready for Palm Springs?

99
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:43,259
Charlie, you still want to
go with all these problems?

100
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,387
We're seconds away from closing
this deal, clearing 75 grand.

101
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:47,972
Not bad for a couple
of phone calls, huh?

102
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:49,306
No, not bad at all.

103
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:50,891
You know where to find
us, right, Lenny?

104
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:54,787
Right. I got it under control.

105
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,086
Listen, I don't want
to be demanding here,

106
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:22,131
but do you think, could you possibly
say, I don't know, 10 or 12 words

107
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:24,775
before we get to the hotel?

108
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:28,020
Consider it foreplay.

109
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:31,407
Can you include me in
some of your thoughts?

110
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,267
I'm just thinking.

111
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:34,685
You know, nothing special.
I'm just thinking.

112
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:36,937
Maybe there's something that you're
thinking about that we can talk.

113
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,647
You know, make a
little conversation.

114
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:41,525
If there's something to talk about,
Susanna, we'd be talking about it.

115
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,694
I'm just thinking. What's the big
to-do about me thinking here?

116
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:45,154
I don't know, Charlie.
I just feel like

117
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:47,823
I'm going away for a
few days with someone.

118
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:48,908
Call me crazy.

119
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,618
Okay, you wanna talk, let's talk.

120
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:52,762
- How was your day?
- I don't want to talk! I feel like...

121
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:55,497
- you're excluding me from what's going on.
- No, let's talk!

122
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:56,832
It's not that I want to talk.

123
00:06:56,833 --> 00:07:00,127
One of these again, Susanna. How
did we get back to one of these?

124
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:03,422
I don't know why I put
up with all this.

125
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,133
You wanted to go to Palm Springs,
and we're going to Palm Springs.

126
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,843
Yes, but I didn't want to go alone.

127
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,887
I've been sitting in this car for
more than an hour and a half...

128
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:12,514
You want to talk,
let's talk! Let's talk!

129
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:14,350
This is not talking, this
is you going like...

130
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,478
Yeah.

131
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:19,021
<i>Charlie, this is Lenny.</i>

132
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:21,565
<i>I've been trying to
contact you for a while.</i>

133
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:24,485
<i>I got a long-distance
call from a Mr. Mooney,</i>

134
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:28,005
<i>your father's lawyer.
He's been trying to reach you.</i>

135
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:30,616
<i>Your father has died, Charlie.</i>

136
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,743
<i>- Charlie?</i>
- Uh-huh.

137
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:35,204
<i>I'm sorry. The funeral's
tomorrow in Cincinnati.</i>

138
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:37,247
<i>He said you'd know where.</i>

139
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:38,832
<i>I've got his number.</i>

140
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,918
That's not necessary.
Anything else?

141
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:43,295
<i>No, that's it. Listen, Charlie,
if there's anything I can do...</i>

142
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,456
- All right.
<i>- ...just call...</i>

143
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,886
Sorry about the weekend, hon.

144
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,429
Charlie, the weekend?

145
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:56,058
Look, I told you before, we had
a falling out a long time ago.

146
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:58,644
My mother died when I was two.
It was just him and me.

147
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:01,698
We just didn't get along.

148
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,899
You're going to the funeral, no?

149
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,109
Yeah.

150
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,318
I'm coming with you.

151
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,780
That's really sweet, but there's
really no point, you know?

152
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:11,699
I want to. That's the point.

153
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:15,845
All right. Sorry, I forgot
who I was talking to.

154
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,431
...for our memory, admiration

155
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,599
and respect for him

156
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,270
will live beyond the years
of his life on Earth.

157
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:44,648
Let us consecrate ourselves
to follow his example

158
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,400
of zest for life,

159
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:48,444
dedication to family,

160
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:51,247
and charity to all.

161
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:55,909
And now, with sure and certain
hope of resurrection, life,

162
00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:00,260
we commend to you the soul
of our departed friend.

163
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,967
Just have to go over the details
of the will with him tonight,

164
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,218
then we're outta here.

165
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:16,192
Sure, I can wait in
the car if you like.

166
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:56,553
Somebody should be watering
those roses, they're all dying.

167
00:09:56,554 --> 00:10:00,057
I knew this car my whole
life. Only drove it once.

168
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:03,185
It's a 1949 Buick
Roadmaster convertible.

169
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:07,356
Only 8,000 production models
made. Straight-8. Fireball-8.

170
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:11,161
It was the first full year of
the Dynaflow transmission.

171
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,871
I know it by rote.

172
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,130
You were his only child.

173
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:36,732
You came along when he was,
what, 45 or something?

174
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:39,596
Probably thought he was
never going to have a son.

175
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,944
So he had to love you.

176
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,392
I think you're exaggerating.

177
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:46,895
You were his child,
his son, his blood.

178
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:49,064
Anyway, in these pictures here,
he doesn't look like a man

179
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,024
- who doesn't love his child.
- What are you doing looking at this?

180
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,067
- Put that away.
- No.

181
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,322
Put that away. You
wanna hear a story?

182
00:10:54,348 --> 00:10:55,737
- I'll tell you one story.
- But don't get mad.

183
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,915
I'm just saying. You know the
convertible in the garage? His baby.

184
00:10:57,941 --> 00:11:00,868
- That and the goddamn roses.
- Buick.

185
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:03,829
The car was off-limits to me.
"That's a classic," he'd say.

186
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,873
"It commands respect.
It's not for children."

187
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:08,208
Tenth grade, I'm 16 years
old, and for once,

188
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:11,128
I bring home a report card
and it's almost all A's.

189
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:14,673
I go to my old man,
"Can I take the car out?"

190
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,217
Take the guys out in the Buick,
sort of a victory drive.

191
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,844
He says no.

192
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:21,138
I take it anyway. I steal
the keys, I sneak it out.

193
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:22,764
You took the car
with no permission?

194
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:25,142
- Yes.
- Why? Why then?

195
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:28,020
Because I deserved it.

196
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:30,355
Nothing I did was good
enough for this guy.

197
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,440
Don't you understand that?

198
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:34,234
We're on Columbia
Parkway, four kids.

199
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,653
- We get pulled over.
- An accident?

200
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:38,488
Pulled over.

201
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:42,584
- What is pulled over? Police?
- Yes, police.

202
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,828
- Can I finish?
- Yes.

203
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,580
He called in a report
of a stolen car,

204
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:49,124
not his son took the car
without permission,

205
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:53,295
just stolen. Central station, the other
guys' dads bail them out in an hour,

206
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:56,715
- he left me there two days.
- He left you in prison for two days?

207
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,517
Two days.

208
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:01,487
Were you scared?

209
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:04,031
Yeah, I was scared.

210
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:07,893
Left home. I never saw him again.

211
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:10,270
Charlie, after a year
we've been together,

212
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,731
this is the first time
I've heard this story.

213
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,566
It's strange, no?

214
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:18,654
I mean, how can you keep all this
inside you and not say anything?

215
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:20,239
When I was a kid and I got scared,

216
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,168
the Rain Man would
come and sing to me.

217
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,628
Rain what?

218
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:30,258
You know, one of those
imaginary childhood friends.

219
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,251
What happened to him?

220
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,975
Nothing. I just grew up.

221
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,005
Not so much.

222
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,343
<i>"And I remember, too,
the day you left home,</i>

223
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:44,346
<i>"so full of bitterness
and grandiose ideas,</i>

224
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:46,473
<i>"so full of yourself.</i>

225
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:48,016
<i>"And being raised without a mother,</i>

226
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,852
<i>"the hardness of your heart
is understandable, as well.</i>

227
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:55,190
"Your refusal to even pretend
that you loved or respected me,

228
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,900
"all these I forgive.

229
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:59,319
"But your failure to
write, to telephone,

230
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,196
"to reenter my life in any way,

231
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,073
"has left me without a son.

232
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:05,200
"I wish you all I
ever wanted for you.

233
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,719
"I wish you the best."

234
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:16,420
"I hereby bequeath to my son,
Charles Sanford Babbitt,

235
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:18,588
"that certain Buick convertible,

236
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:23,051
"the very car that, unfortunately,
brought our relationship to an end.

237
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:27,222
"Also, outright title to my
prize-winning hybrid rosebushes.

238
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,516
"May they remind him of
the value of excellence

239
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,727
"and the possibility of perfection.

240
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:34,730
"As for my home and all other
property, real and personal,

241
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:36,773
"these shall be placed in trust

242
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:39,067
"in accordance with the terms
of that certain instrument

243
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:41,486
"executed concurrently herewith."

244
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,071
The last part, what does that mean?

245
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,531
It means that the estate,

246
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:49,453
in excess of $3 million
after expenses and taxes,

247
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:51,330
will go into a trust fund

248
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:53,790
for a beneficiary to be
named in this document.

249
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,417
Who is that?

250
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:57,210
I'm afraid I can't tell you that.

251
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:58,795
Who controls the money?
You? You control the money?

252
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,505
No, it's called a trustee.

253
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,883
What is that? How does that work?
How does that work?

254
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:06,553
Forgive me, but there's
nothing more I can say.

255
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:09,765
Now, I'm sorry, son. I can see
that you're disappointed.

256
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:11,350
Disappointed? Why should
I be disappointed?

257
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,935
I got rosebushes, didn't I?
I got a used car, didn't I?

258
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:15,937
What's-his-name got...
What'd you call him?

259
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:18,732
- Beneficiary.
- Right, beneficiary. He got $3 million.

260
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:20,734
But he didn't get the rosebushes.
I got the rosebushes.

261
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:22,069
I definitely got the rosebushes.

262
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,071
- Charles...
- I definitely got the rosebushes.

263
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:25,822
- I mean, those are rosebushes.
- There is no need...

264
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:27,532
To what?

265
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,755
To be upset?

266
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:31,587
To be upset?

267
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,206
If there is a hell, sir,

268
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:36,792
my father is in it, and he
is looking up right now

269
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:40,014
and he is laughing his
ass off. Sanford Babbitt,

270
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,996
you want to be that guy's son for five
minutes? Did you hear that letter?

271
00:14:42,997 --> 00:14:47,557
- Were you listening?
- Yes, sir, I was. Were you?

272
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:52,400
No. Could you repeat it?
I can't believe my fuckin' ears.

273
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:57,955
I was looking for you.

274
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:00,666
How did it go?

275
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:03,748
I got what I expected.

276
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:22,726
Susanna, this could
take a few minutes.

277
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,647
Can I help you?

278
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:41,940
Yes, I think you can.

279
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,734
I have a problem with
a private trust...

280
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:47,487
- That's a terrific suit.
- Thank you.

281
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:50,211
My father was Sanford Babbitt...

282
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,976
Is this Wallbrook?

283
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,044
Excuse me. Is this Wallbrook?

284
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,017
Excuse me.

285
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:13,889
Dr. Bruner is still in conference.

286
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,432
Would you like to wait
in his outer office?

287
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:18,531
No, we'll stay here. Thank you.

288
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:35,911
Maybe we're not supposed to
be looking around here, no?

289
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,514
<i>Good to have you here. Good
luck to all three of you.</i>

290
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:58,808
<i>$20 starts you all off on a very
important match, starts with this.</i>

291
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:02,771
<i>In what 1980 comedy film did Goldie
Hawn get away from it all? Lisa?</i>

292
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:03,897
<i>- Lisa?</i>
- Private Benjamin.

293
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:07,952
Excuse me, please. I want
to watch the TV, please.

294
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,237
<i>For whose grandson</i>

295
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:13,281
<i>was the presidential retreat
Camp David named? Lisa?</i>

296
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,617
<i>- Eisenhower.
- That's right. For David Eisenhower.</i>

297
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:18,745
<i>You've got another five.

299
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:51,820
Whatever this is, I don't
understand the point of secrecy.

300
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:54,197
This patient is an old
girlfriend of my father's?

301
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,992
Mr. Babbitt, I knew your father
since you were two years old.

302
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:58,285
The year my mother died.

303
00:17:58,286 --> 00:17:59,828
Look, I'm trustee of the fund,

304
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:01,538
but this hospital receives
nothing from that.

305
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:04,374
That hardly seems fair. Maybe that's
something that we could discuss.

306
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,835
I took on this burden out
of loyalty to your father.

307
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:08,461
That's where my loyalty ends.

308
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:10,630
And you think I should feel
a little of that loyalty?

309
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:13,341
I think you feel cheated
out of your birthright

310
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:16,553
by a man who had
difficulty showing love.

311
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:19,848
And I think if I were in your
shoes, I'd probably feel the same.

312
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:21,349
I was hoping that we could talk,

313
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,059
that you would explain
my father's side of it,

314
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,769
help me understand the
right in what he's done,

315
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:28,023
because, failing that, I have
responsibilities of my own,

316
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:30,942
and they have to be met,
even if that means a fight.

317
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:33,528
Sorry, this is not your car.
It's my boyfriend's.

318
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,905
Yeah, my dad lets me drive
slow on the driveway.

319
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,324
I'm an excellent driver.

320
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:38,867
Are you sure that
you drive this car?

321
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:42,996
There's only 28 miles on the odometer since
I drove it a week ago, last Saturday.

322
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:44,706
Should be more than 28 miles.

323
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:46,541
Look, my boyfriend is coming.

324
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,043
Course, today's Monday.

325
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:51,171
I always drive the car on
Saturday, never drive on Monday.

326
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:52,339
What is this? Who is this guy?

327
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,882
I don't know, he
jumped into the car.

328
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:55,300
Well, he can jump out.

329
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:56,468
I'm an excellent driver.

330
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,862
That's good. Come on, come on.

331
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:02,349
Why did you let him get in
this car? It's not a toy.

332
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,392
He says he... He says
he drives this car.

333
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,645
Dad lets me drive slow on the
driveway every Saturday.

334
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:11,608
Course, the seats were originally brown
leather, now they're pitiful red.

335
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:14,377
You know, these seats
were brown leather.

336
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:16,237
You know this car?

337
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:18,506
I know this car.

338
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,118
How do you know this car?

339
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,412
Definitely know this car.
It's a 1949 Buick Roadmaster.

340
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:28,667
Straight-S, Fireball-8.
Only 8,095 production models.

341
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:31,252
Dad lets me drive slow on the
driveway, but not on Monday.

342
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:32,379
Definitely not on Monday.

343
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,673
- Who's your dad?
- Sanford Babbitt.

344
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:35,757
Sanford Babbitt?

345
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:39,528
10961 Beechcrest Street,
Cincinnati, Ohio.

346
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,888
That's my address.
What is it with this guy?

347
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,473
Hey, who's your mother?

348
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:44,599
Eleanor Babbitt.

349
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,725
Eleanor?

350
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:48,311
Died January 5, 1965, after
a short and sudden illness.

351
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,437
Who the hell are you?

352
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:50,605
- Uh-oh.
- Huh?

353
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,023
Wait a second, where are you going?

354
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,442
Thirteen minutes to Judge
Wapner and <i>The People's Court.</i>

355
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,569
Hold it, wait a second here,
I want to ask you a question.

356
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:59,364
"What you are witnessing is real.
The participants are not..."

357
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:01,667
Hey, I'm talking to you!

358
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:05,120
Bruner, who is this guy?

359
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:06,663
Raymond is your brother.

360
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:08,456
"...have their dispute
settled here in our forum,

361
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:09,541
<i>"The People's Court."</i>

362
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:12,210
My brother? I don't have a brother.

363
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:15,004
"...court cases, and have their
dispute settled here in our forum,

364
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,131
<i>"The People's Court."</i>

365
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:20,260
<i>"The People's Court."</i>

366
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:22,654
<i>"The People's Court."</i>

367
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:26,775
The People's Court.

368
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,436
<i>Hello, I'm Doug Llewelyn,</i>

369
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:31,980
<i>and welcome to</i> The People's Court.

370
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:33,815
- What, is he crazy?
- No.

371
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:35,483
- Is he retarded?
- Not exactly.

372
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,318
Well, he's not crazy, he's
not retarded, but he's here.

373
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,237
He's an autistic savant.

374
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,697
I don't know what that means.

375
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:43,199
Some people like him used
to be called idiot savants.

376
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,161
They have certain deficiencies,
certain abilities.

377
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:47,495
Yeah, but he's retarded.

378
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,998
Autistic. Actually,
high-functioning.

379
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:51,875
What does that mean?

380
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:54,169
It means that there's a disability

381
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:57,338
that impairs the sensory input
and how it's processed.

382
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,674
English here. You're
talking over my head.

383
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:02,135
Raymond has a problem
communicating and learning.

384
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:03,386
He can't even express himself,

385
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:05,472
or probably even

386
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:08,492
understand his own emotions
in a traditional way.

387
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:12,479
<i>...and after that, the dog bit him.</i>

388
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,981
<i>I yelled at my dog,
the dog laid down...</i>

389
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:17,025
There are dangers
everywhere for Raymond.

390
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:20,111
Routines, rituals, it's all
he has to protect himself.

391
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,614
Rituals. That's a good one.

392
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:25,450
It's the way he acts,

393
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:27,035
sleeps, eats,

394
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:29,788
uses the bathroom, walks,
talks, everything.

395
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:32,457
Any break from the routines,
and it's terrifying.

396
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:33,833
How long has he been here?

397
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,376
Well, let's see.
I came here in 1960.

398
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,128
No, how old is he?

399
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,756
He was 18 or 20 then. I'd
have to check the records...

400
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:42,342
- You've been here that long?
- That's when I actually started.

401
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:45,303
So that's '65, '75, '85.

402
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,222
I was almost three years old
and you knew he had a brother,

403
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:49,808
you knew I was his brother.

404
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:51,184
Yes, but what's the point?

405
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:53,186
What's the point? What's
the fuckin' point is

406
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:55,313
why didn't anybody tell
me I had a brother?

407
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:58,412
What would you have done about it?

408
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,539
I don't know.

409
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:05,198
Does he know how much
money he's been left?

410
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:08,878
No, he doesn't understand
the concept of money.

411
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:12,080
He doesn't understand
the concept of money.

412
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:14,457
He's just inherited $3 million,

413
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:17,377
and he doesn't understand
the concept of money?

414
00:22:17,378 --> 00:22:20,463
That is fucking poetic,

415
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:22,937
don't you think?

416
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:26,052
Good old Dad.

417
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,762
...name's yes. Then
who's playing first? Yes.

418
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:29,514
I mean the fellow's name
on first base. Who.

419
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:31,599
The fellow playing first
base for St. Louis. Who.

420
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,352
- What are you asking me for?
- What is this? Why is he doing that?

421
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,396
Whenever he gets nervous,
he does "Who's on First?"

422
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:38,940
- You know, from Abbott and Costello.
- Yeah. Why?

423
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:42,527
Why? It's his way of dealing with you
touching things, his books and stuff.

424
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:44,612
So he memorized "Who's on First?"

425
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:46,281
Yeah, that among other things.

426
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:48,157
Raymond, Ted Klus-zesski.

427
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:49,617
- Kluszewski.
- Kluszewski.

428
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:52,287
Kluszewski, Ted Kluszewski,
Big Klew, first base.

429
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:53,621
He played for Cincinnati?

430
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,957
Course, he was traded
for Dee Fondy, 1957.

431
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:59,127
- Lifetime batting average .298.
- All these great books. He reads, huh?

432
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:02,005
Reads and remembers whatever
he gets his hands on.

433
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:05,967
Oh, Vern. V-E-R-N!

434
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:08,636
Course, these people are
gonna be here all day, Vern.

435
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,847
This is an unannounced visit, Vern.

436
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:13,850
This is definitely not
a weekend visit, Vern.

437
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:17,450
- He's getting anxious. It's okay, Ray!
- Oh, Vern!

438
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:20,565
This is an unannounced visit, Vern.

439
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:22,400
Put it back. He said not
to touch the books.

440
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:23,651
Not to touch books.

441
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,778
- You like Shakespeare, Ray?
- I don't know.

442
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,405
- Did you read all this?
- I don't know.

443
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,656
- You don't know?
- Vern.

444
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:29,991
- Did you read <i>Macbeth</i>?
- I don't know. Vern.

445
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:31,826
- You read <i>Hamlet</i>?
- I don't know. Vern!

446
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,536
- Read the <i>Twelfth Night</i>?
- Stop it!

447
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:34,621
- Yes.
- Yes?

448
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:35,705
Yes.

449
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:38,333
You read all these stories
that are in this book,

450
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:39,792
and you don't know if
you read the book?

451
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:41,002
I don't know. V-E-R-N.

452
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:42,045
You don't know?

453
00:23:42,046 --> 00:23:44,689
Maybe you better put it back.

454
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:49,232
You don't know, okay. No, Ray,
take it easy, I'm not going to...

455
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:51,554
I won't touch anything else, Ray.

456
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:53,765
It's okay, Ray. It's okay. Come on.

457
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:54,974
My main man.

458
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:56,976
Yeah, Vern, my main man.

459
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:58,311
My main man, Vern.

460
00:23:58,312 --> 00:24:00,659
- It's okay, Ray.
- Yeah.

461
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:03,191
- My main man.
- Yeah, my main man.

462
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:04,567
Here.

463
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:05,693
Here are your cards.

464
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:07,904
I'm sorry, I didn't know where
you want me to put them.

465
00:24:07,905 --> 00:24:10,907
Are you taking any
prescription medication?

466
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,329
He likes you. That's just
his way of showing it.

467
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:17,747
Uh-oh.

468
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:19,874
When I touched him
before, he pulled away.

469
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,542
Don't take it personal.

470
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:22,919
He never touched me.

471
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,629
I'm closer to him than
anybody in the world.

472
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,714
Known him for nine years.

473
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,216
It's not in him.

474
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:29,884
If I left town tomorrow
and didn't say goodbye...

475
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,928
- Uh-oh.
- ...he'd never notice.

476
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:33,888
He wouldn't notice if you left?

477
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:37,693
I'm not sure, but I don't think
people are his first priority.

478
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:40,603
Hey, Ray, you want
to go take a walk?

479
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:42,701
Hmm? Ray?

480
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:45,024
Ray?

481
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:48,069
Can he hear us when he's like that?

482
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:50,154
Hey, man. You wanna show
your brother your ducks?

483
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:53,549
Course, it's 27
minutes to <i>Jeopardy!</i>

484
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:55,952
Don't worry, Ray, we'll
bring you right back.

485
00:24:55,953 --> 00:24:58,329
Practically 26 minutes to <i>Jeopardy!</i>

486
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,622
We'll bring him right back.

487
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:01,332
26 minutes to <i>Jeopardy!</i>

488
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,750
I won't do it.

489
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:03,793
I can't do it.

490
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:08,506
First of all because of your tone
of voice, this commanding...

491
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:09,757
You're upset. Just calm down.

492
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:11,092
And second thing is because
you didn't tell me why.

493
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:13,469
- Raymond, I'm gonna talk to Susanna alone.
- Bye, Raymond.

494
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:16,931
Susanna, just hold on.
Okay? I'll be right back.

495
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,599
No. Just stay.

496
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,226
Just stay there.

497
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:22,770
No, Raymond. Raymond.
Raymond. Raymond!

498
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:27,608
Just stay there. Just stand
still, okay? That's good.

499
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:31,413
Okay, I'll do it if you tell
me why. Why do I do, uh...

500
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:33,448
What?

501
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:36,117
Why do I have to take the
car and go down there

502
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:37,910
and wait for you again at the gate?

503
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:39,662
- I've been waiting for you for days.
- No.

504
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:41,956
- Why?
- It's for Raymond.

505
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,929
The car disturbs him.

506
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:46,803
- That's why?
- That's why.

507
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:49,672
Okay, Raymond.

508
00:26:00,184 --> 00:26:01,434
What are you looking at, Ray?

509
00:26:01,435 --> 00:26:03,061
Ray, the ducks are over here,
what are you looking at?

510
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:05,034
I don't know.

511
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:10,359
Listen, our father died.

512
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,403
Did you know that he died last
week, did they tell you that?

513
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:13,613
I don't know.

514
00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:17,634
You don't know if they told you,
or you don't know what dead is?

515
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:22,163
That means he's gone. He's not with
us anymore. He's at the cemetery.

516
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:23,664
You want to go see him
at the cemetery, Ray?

517
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:24,916
I don't know.

518
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:27,001
Does that mean maybe? Does
that mean maybe you wanna go?

519
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:28,974
I don't know.

520
00:26:31,632 --> 00:26:33,091
You know, I live in Los Angeles.

521
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:37,178
I thought maybe you'd go to Los
Angeles, like to see a Dodger game.

522
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:39,680
Go see the Dodgers play.

523
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:40,848
Today's an off day.

524
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:41,891
We don't have to go today.

525
00:26:41,892 --> 00:26:43,142
Monday. No games scheduled.

526
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:45,144
Just thought maybe you'd like
to go to Los Angeles with me,

527
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:47,605
you know, go see Fernando
Valenzuela pitch.

528
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:50,608
Fernando Valenzuela pitched Saturday.
Not scheduled to pitch till Wednesday.

529
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:53,194
- He's gonna pitch on Wednesday?
- Wednesday.

530
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:54,904
I'm not doing anything
on Wednesday.

531
00:26:54,905 --> 00:26:56,030
Yeah, Wednesday.

532
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:57,832
- Let's go to L.A.
- Yeah.

533
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,251
Come on, Ray.

534
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:04,497
Course, it's a long
way to California.

535
00:27:04,498 --> 00:27:08,084
I'm definitely not supposed to be off
the grounds for more than two hours.

536
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:09,752
Definitely have to be
back in two hours.

537
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:13,005
Wait till you get there. The people,
crowds cheering. You'll love it.

538
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:15,308
Have to be back in two hours.

539
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:57,485
- Here's the Presidential Suite.
- Dinner's at 6:30 p.m.

540
00:28:57,486 --> 00:28:59,320
And to the left is Raymond's room.

541
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:00,613
Look at this big,
beautiful room, huh, Ray?

542
00:29:00,614 --> 00:29:02,990
This is not my room, this
is definitely not my room.

543
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:04,575
It's just for tonight, Ray.

544
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,369
Have to go back to
Wallbrook for dinner.

545
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:07,870
Little guy, little guy!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

546
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:08,996
This is gonna be terrific.

547
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:10,915
We're brothers. Dr. Bruner wants
us to spend time together.

548
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:12,291
We're gonna have some fun.

549
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:13,709
- When did he say that?
- He said that.

550
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,169
Course, I don't have
my tapioca pudding.

551
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,712
We have tapioca
pudding for dessert.

552
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:19,966
Yeah, well, we can do that. We can work
tapioca pudding, I'm gonna call Lenny.

553
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:22,760
Course, this is definitely not my room,
and I don't have my tapioca pudding,

554
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:23,844
and the bed's in the wrong place.

555
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:24,929
That's definitely not my bed.

556
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:26,180
You don't like it
there, you can move it.

557
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:29,642
- Where do you want the bed, Raymond?
- Should be near the window.

558
00:29:29,643 --> 00:29:32,395
Course, I don't have my books.

559
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:33,854
Course, there are no bookshelves.

560
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:36,774
I'm definitely out of books.
I'm gonna be bookless.

561
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,276
Here's a book.

562
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:40,695
Big telephone book, huh?
Lot of words.

563
00:29:40,696 --> 00:29:42,863
Lenny, pick up, will you?

564
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:44,573
I got $200,000 about to
go in the shit house,

565
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:46,492
and he doesn't wanna
answer the phone.

566
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:49,245
What is it, 6:00 here? That means
it's 9:00 there, huh, Susanna?

567
00:29:49,246 --> 00:29:51,622
- No, it's 3:00 there.
- 6:30 p.m. is dinner.

568
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:52,873
It's 3:00 there.

569
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:55,376
It's 3:00, he doesn't
want to answer the phone?

570
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:57,795
Orange soda.

571
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,880
Has to be in a can with a straw.
Room temperature.

572
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:02,883
Bruner told you that
you should do this?

573
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:04,510
- Huh?
- It doesn't make sense to me.

574
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:07,029
I know what's good for him.

575
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:26,574
Uh-oh!

576
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:28,200
Uh-oh! V-E-R-N!

577
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:31,845
Oh, God. Go see what
he's doing, will you?

578
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:33,581
Ray?

579
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:36,292
- V-E-R-N! Home... Home...
- What is it, Ray? Huh?

580
00:30:36,293 --> 00:30:37,710
What's happening, homes?

581
00:30:37,711 --> 00:30:39,628
- Uh-oh.
- It's fine, everything is fine.

582
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:41,422
Charlie, let's take
him home. Come on.

583
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:43,007
No, he's okay.

584
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:44,592
We'll just get him some
dinner, he'll be all right.

585
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:46,761
What'd you say you
wanted? Hamburger?

586
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:48,262
Hamburger, Ray? Huh?

587
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:51,057
Course, we have pepperoni pizza
Monday night for dinner.

588
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:53,476
Pizza? You get pizza
in the institution?

589
00:30:53,477 --> 00:30:55,936
Course, Monday night's
Italian Night.

590
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:57,271
<i>Hello, offices of
Mitchell & Mitchell.</i>

591
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:59,106
Yeah, get me Stu. This is
Charlie Babbitt calling.

592
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:01,317
<i>I'm sorry, he's not here.</i>

593
00:31:01,318 --> 00:31:03,903
Where is he? I got a bit
of a legal problem here.

594
00:31:03,904 --> 00:31:06,280
<i>He's out of town until
tomorrow afternoon.</i>

595
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:08,924
All right, I'll call him tomorrow.

596
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:13,996
No TV during dinnertime.
Definitely not.

597
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:15,294
Yes, but we can watch TV here.

598
00:31:15,295 --> 00:31:17,933
- We can. We're allowed.
- Yeah. Yeah.

599
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,922
<i>"Wheel of Fortune!</i>

No, I don't want pepperoni.

00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,584
- How long's that going to take?
<i>- 20 minutes.</i>

612
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,711
Bring some beer up for
two, and orange soda.

613
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:04,380
Tapioca pudding, you
got tapioca pudding?

614
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:05,506
<i>No, sir, we don't have any.</i>

615
00:32:05,507 --> 00:32:09,176
Well, just bring the closest
thing. All right, great.

616
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:10,719
- Here, Ray.
- Yeah.

617
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,556
- Take this, and food is coming shortly.
- Yeah. Yeah.

618
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:16,405
- And I'll be right back.
- Yeah.

619
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:22,624
Course, I'm going to be here for
a long time. A very long time.

620
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:26,373
I'm gone for good, gone
for good from my home.

621
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:30,614
<i>If I had said anything,
or did anything...</i>

622
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:31,782
<i>Get out of here!</i>

623
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:34,877
<i>It's all right, Susan.</i>

624
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:13,699
<i>J.J., it's lucky I came right
over after I got your message.</i>

625
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,743
<i>I got here as quickly
as I could, but...</i>

626
00:33:15,744 --> 00:33:17,670
<i>What message?</i>

627
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:21,999
<i>What message?</i>

628
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,394
<i>Well, be that as it may,
someone called me...</i>

629
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:37,223
- Oh, <i>si, si.
- Si.</i>

630
00:33:37,224 --> 00:33:39,141
<i>It's just lucky I got your message
and came over here in time.</i>

631
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:41,194
<i>Why?</i>

632
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:47,525
<i>J. J., Susie was so depressed
she tried to kill herself.</i>

633
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:54,756
- Ah.
- Uh.

634
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:57,301
- Uh-huh.
- Uh-huh.

635
00:33:57,327 --> 00:33:59,036
What is that?

636
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:02,289
- I think Raymond is in the room.
- What?

637
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,457
Raymond, are you in here?

638
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:05,584
Charlie, Charlie Babbitt.

639
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:07,336
Well, get out.

640
00:34:07,337 --> 00:34:08,587
Get out!

641
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:09,964
- Go!
- Stop it!

642
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:11,891
Uh-oh.

643
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:14,927
- Jesus Christ!
- Stop it.

644
00:34:14,928 --> 00:34:16,262
Go in there with him.

645
00:34:16,263 --> 00:34:17,596
- Come on, Charlie, go in there.
- What?

646
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:18,806
- He's your brother.
- Why?

647
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:21,308
He's afraid. He doesn't
understand this.

648
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:24,111
Come on, go in there!

649
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:31,107
Raymond, what were you doing in
my room? Raymond. Raymond!

650
00:34:31,133 --> 00:34:32,628
- What were you doing in my room?
- I don't know.

651
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:34,530
You don't know what you
were doing in my room.

652
00:34:34,531 --> 00:34:36,609
- Course, there were noises.
- There were noises.

653
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:40,411
Well, those noises are none of your
business, you understand that? Huh?

654
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:43,038
Put the phone book down, stop acting
like an idiot, and go to sleep.

655
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:45,332
Hey, did you hear what
I said? Go to sleep!

656
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:46,500
Go to sleep!

657
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:48,586
Course, it's nine minutes to
11:00. Lights out at 11:00.

658
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:50,730
Yeah, well, new rules.

659
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:06,145
You don't listen to me.
You don't listen to me.

660
00:35:06,146 --> 00:35:07,479
What? What are you talking about?

661
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:11,358
I asked you to go there and apologize.
You went there and insulted him again!

662
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,527
What am I supposed to do,
tuck him in? I'm not his mother.

663
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:17,221
Charlie, you're his brother. His brother!
They tell you today for the first time

664
00:35:17,247 --> 00:35:19,235
that you have a brother, and
I don't see in your face

665
00:35:19,236 --> 00:35:21,034
- one little reaction.
- Take it easy. Take it easy.

666
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:23,078
I'm not saying joy,
I'm saying something.

667
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:24,788
Take it easy, you don't know
what I'm going through here.

668
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:25,873
No, I don't know what
you're going through.

669
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:27,942
What are you going through?
Because I don't know.

670
00:35:27,943 --> 00:35:29,960
Because you don't tell me anything.

671
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:33,756
- You just give me lies, lies, lies.
- Lies, lies? What lies?

672
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:37,092
The thing that Dr. Bruner asked you
to bring him here, this is bullshit.

673
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:40,304
I know it's not true. So why don't
you tell me, why is he here?

674
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:41,388
'Cause I'm pissed at him.

675
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:42,973
- At who?
- At my father.

676
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:45,392
You're pissed at your father,
and you bring Raymond here why?

677
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:47,353
I don't know why. 'Cause I
got him and they want him.

678
00:35:47,354 --> 00:35:49,429
- This makes no sense!
- Raymond was left all the money,

679
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:51,099
- and I got nothing.
- How much?

680
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,442
$3 million. The inheritance,
every penny of it.

681
00:35:53,443 --> 00:35:55,499
- So?
- So I'm gonna keep him till I get my half!

682
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,313
I deserve that!

683
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:03,093
What is this? Huh? Susanna?

684
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:05,537
- Just take it easy here.
- I've had enough.

685
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:07,748
What? You've had enough? What does
that mean, you've had enough?

686
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:08,957
I've just had enough, I'm leaving.

687
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,250
- You're leaving?
- Yes.

688
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:11,877
You're leaving me now? I need you.

689
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:14,380
- I need you now.
- What? You need nobody.

690
00:36:14,381 --> 00:36:16,090
What does that mean?

691
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:19,885
What? Just take it easy.
What is my crime here?

692
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:22,846
- What is my goddamn crime?
- Your crime is that you use people!

693
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:25,099
You're using Raymond!
You're using me!

694
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,266
You use everybody.

695
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:27,726
I'm using Raymond? Raymond!

696
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:30,229
Raymond, am I using you?
Am I using you, Raymond?

697
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,313
- Yeah.
- Shut up!

698
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:33,607
He is answering a question
from a half-hour ago!

699
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,275
What good is $3 million to him?

700
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:38,028
That money is only just gonna sit
there for the rest of his life.

701
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,822
And I need that money, you
know I need that money!

702
00:36:39,823 --> 00:36:42,199
Yeah, you need them, so it's
hardly like stealing, no?

703
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,076
And when it's over, what
happens to Raymond?

704
00:36:44,077 --> 00:36:45,828
He'll go back to Wallbrook,
or a better place.

705
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:48,288
With the money, I will put
him in a better place.

706
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:50,374
What difference does it make?
He is gonna be just the same!

707
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:51,834
Only you have his money, yeah!

708
00:36:51,835 --> 00:36:53,669
His money? That man
was my father, too.

709
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:56,046
What about my fuckin' half?
Where's my fuckin' half?

710
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,297
I'm entitled to that money!

711
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:58,674
You've kidnapped this man!

712
00:36:58,675 --> 00:37:00,217
- I did not take him.
- Yes, you did.

713
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,136
I did not take him, I took my half.

714
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:03,512
Which half? You're crazy!

715
00:37:03,513 --> 00:37:04,847
Yeah, it runs in the family.

716
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:07,391
You're wet, soaking wet and you're gonna
leave in the middle of the night.

717
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:09,476
Would you just... Just wait!

718
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:11,895
My father has stuck
it to me all my life.

719
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,605
- What do you want from me?
- I want out.

720
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:15,578
Out.

721
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:08,285
Stop it.

722
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:10,871
Good morning. Coffee?

723
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:12,873
Yes. That'd be good.

724
00:38:12,874 --> 00:38:15,042
Sally Dibbs. Dibbs, Sally.

725
00:38:15,043 --> 00:38:18,545
461-0192.

726
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,893
How did you know my phone number?

727
00:38:21,925 --> 00:38:23,050
How'd you know that?

728
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:25,177
You said read the telephone
book last night. Dibbs, Sally.

729
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:27,446
461-0192.

730
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:31,642
He remembers things,
little things sometimes.

731
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:35,117
Very clever, boys.
I'll be right back.

732
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:37,397
How'd you do that?

733
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:39,274
- I don't know.
- You memorized the whole book?

734
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:40,359
No.

735
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,568
- You start from the beginning?
- Yeah.

736
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:43,070
- How far did you get?
- "G."

737
00:38:43,071 --> 00:38:44,279
- "G"?
- "G." Gottsaken.

738
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,823
William Marshall Gottsaken.

739
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:49,093
- You memorized to "G"?
- Yeah, "G."

740
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:51,078
A, B, C, D, E, F, G?

741
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:53,381
"G." Half Of "G."

742
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:56,959
- That's good, Ray.
- Yeah.

743
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,307
- I like that.
- Yeah.

744
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:02,812
We hungry?

745
00:39:02,813 --> 00:39:04,992
- Yeah, Tuesday we have pancakes.
- Pancakes.

746
00:39:04,993 --> 00:39:07,254
- That sounds good. We'll get some pancakes.
- Yeah, with maple syrup.

747
00:39:07,262 --> 00:39:09,905
- Hey, bet your butt.
- Bet your butt.

748
00:39:10,974 --> 00:39:12,057
Uh-oh.

749
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:14,685
- They got pancakes.
- Uh-oh.

750
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:15,894
What is this, Ray?

751
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:17,980
Course, I don't have
my tooth picks.

752
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:20,399
No, you don't need toothpicks.

753
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,192
That was okay in the hotel
last night with the pizza,

754
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,735
but in a restaurant,
you eat with a fork.

755
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:24,862
Course, I don't have
my tooth picks.

756
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:26,363
You don't need toothpicks, Ray.

757
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,615
Pancakes keep sliding off.
You're gonna eat with a fork.

758
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:29,992
I don't have my maple
syrup, either.

759
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:32,286
I'm gonna be without my maple
syrup and my toothpicks.

760
00:39:32,287 --> 00:39:34,538
You don't see any
pancakes, do you, Ray?

761
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:36,818
Course, your promised
maple syrup is not here.

762
00:39:36,819 --> 00:39:40,751
Ray? When we order the pancakes,
they're gonna bring the maple syrup.

763
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:43,797
Maple syrup is supposed to be on
the table before the pancakes.

764
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:45,132
We haven't ordered yet, Ray.

765
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:46,884
Course, when they bring the
maple syrup after the pancakes,

766
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:48,927
it'll definitely be too late.

767
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:51,013
How is that gonna be
too late? Huh, Ray?

768
00:39:51,014 --> 00:39:52,806
We haven't ordered the pancakes
yet. How is that gonna be...

769
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,641
We're gonna be here
the entire morning

770
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:57,144
with no maple syrup
and no toothpicks,

771
00:39:57,145 --> 00:40:00,522
I'm definitely, definitely not
gonna have my pancakes with...

772
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:01,899
- Ow!
- Ray.

773
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,525
- Don't make a scene.
- Ow!

774
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:05,360
Stop acting like a fuckin' retard.

775
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:07,538
Uh-oh.

776
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:31,069
What is this, what are you writing?

777
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:33,939
What the fuck is this?

778
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:36,892
"Serious... Serious injury list"?

779
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:38,852
"Charlie Babbitt.
Serious injury list"?

780
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:41,313
What, are you fuckin' kidding me?

781
00:40:41,314 --> 00:40:45,484
"Number 18 in 1988.

782
00:40:45,485 --> 00:40:48,195
"Squeezed and pulled and
hurt my neck in 1988."

783
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:51,875
Squeezed and pulled and
hurt your neck in 1988?

784
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:57,079
- Dr. Bruner, it's Charlie Babbitt.
<i>- Where are you, son?</i>

785
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,539
It's not important. What
matters is who I'm with.

786
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:02,250
<i>You have to bring him back, Mr.
Babbitt. Do you understand me?</i>

787
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:05,379
No problem whatsoever.
That'll be $1.5 million.

788
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,755
- I'm not greedy, I just want my half.
- Uh-oh.

789
00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:08,340
Raymond, don't touch
that. That's dirty.

790
00:41:08,341 --> 00:41:11,343
<i>I can't do that, Mr.
Babbitt. You know I can't.</i>

791
00:41:11,344 --> 00:41:13,971
<i>Just bring him back, and
bring him back now.</i>

792
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:15,055
<i>This is where he belongs.</i>

793
00:41:15,056 --> 00:41:18,642
I'm his brother. It's not
like kidnapping, is it?

794
00:41:18,643 --> 00:41:20,185
<i>He's always been a
voluntary patient here,</i>

795
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:22,229
<i>but that's beside the point.</i>

796
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:24,898
<i>The fact of the matter is, this is
where he can get the best care.</i>

797
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:27,275
<i>We're talking about his well-being.</i>

798
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:29,653
Yeah, let's just cut through
the bullshit, okay?

799
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:31,905
Now, I am entitled to part
of my father's estate.

800
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:35,075
If you don't want to cut a deal with
me, I'll fly him back to Los Angeles,

801
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:36,910
stick him in an
institution out there,

802
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:40,247
and we can have a custody
battle over him.

803
00:41:40,248 --> 00:41:42,416
Miss, he needs toothpicks.

804
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:44,710
Could you help him, get him some
toothpicks? Thank you very much.

805
00:41:44,711 --> 00:41:46,628
You want to battle
me in the courts?

806
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:48,338
Think about that,

807
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,132
Dr. Bruner, think about that.

808
00:41:50,133 --> 00:41:52,009
Or we can cut a deal right now.

809
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:55,303
<i>I don't think you have any idea of
the severity of Raymond's condition.</i>

810
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:57,935
Toothpicks. He needs some
toothpicks. Can we just get him...

811
00:41:57,936 --> 00:41:59,683
- some toothpicks over here?
- Yeah.

812
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:03,228
<i>And I cannot, under any circumstances,
make any money deals with you.</i>

813
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:05,872
Then I'll see you in court.

814
00:42:09,986 --> 00:42:12,946
Can I have the check?
Sorry about the toothpicks.

815
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:15,615
82, 82, 82.

816
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:17,242
82 what, Ray?

817
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:19,841
- How much is this?
- Toothpicks.

818
00:42:21,831 --> 00:42:23,915
It's a lot more than
82 toothpicks, Ray.

819
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:26,626
Course, 246 total.

820
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:28,599
Keep the change.

821
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:31,840
Ray. How many
toothpicks are in there?

822
00:42:31,841 --> 00:42:33,050
250.

823
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:35,469
Pretty close. Come on.
Let's go, Ray.

824
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:37,943
246.

825
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:40,599
There's four left in the box.

826
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:43,977
Course, I have to get my backpack.

827
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:46,246
Forgot my backpack.

Ray. Ray.

833
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:17,052
Enough already. Change the channel.

00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:31,399
Lenny, I don't care what you
think. Did they say that?

837
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,193
You're gonna have to be a lot
more forceful with them.

838
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:34,528
Lenny, are you... Lenny, listen.

839
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:36,238
Lenny, Lenny, shut
up a moment here.

840
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:39,950
I am in serious trouble here. I can't get
to these cars. I can't get the money.

841
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:42,702
Do you understand that?
My loan is past due.

842
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:44,037
<i>Look, I'll call the loan office...</i>

843
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:45,205
Lenny...

844
00:43:45,206 --> 00:43:47,007
<i>...tell them we have

00:43:48,543 --> 00:43:52,587
Lenny, just listen to me. I'll
be in LAX in three hours, okay?

847
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:57,676
Now, remember the Buick is in A3, main
terminal. Make sure they pick it up.

848
00:43:57,677 --> 00:44:00,650
All right, well, right.
We'll see you in a few.

849
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:13,538
Raymond, let's go. Raymond.

850
00:44:14,569 --> 00:44:18,168
Ray! Ray, let's go. Come on.

851
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:22,409
- What are you watching, Ray?
- I don't know.

852
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:23,743
You don't know?

853
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:27,247
<i>Final call for Flight 1569,</i>

<i>service to Salt Lake
City and Los Angeles.</i>

855
00:44:31,711 --> 00:44:32,919
Uh-oh.

856
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,130
Uh-oh. Course, there's
an airplane out there.

857
00:44:35,131 --> 00:44:36,882
Yeah, that's right, and
everybody's boarding. Let's go.

858
00:44:36,883 --> 00:44:38,425
Airline travel's very dangerous.

859
00:44:38,426 --> 00:44:40,260
Don't be silly. It's the
safest travel in the world.

860
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:42,429
- You're gonna love this. Trust me.
- Yeah.

861
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:44,973
- Now, come on.
- Oh, no.

862
00:44:44,974 --> 00:44:46,308
- Ray.
- Yeah.

863
00:44:46,309 --> 00:44:48,602
We're in an airport.
People fly out of airports.

864
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:50,270
What did you think we were
doing here this whole time?

865
00:44:50,271 --> 00:44:53,273
Flying's very dangerous. 1987,
there were 30 airline accidents.

866
00:44:53,274 --> 00:44:56,526
211 were fatalities, 231
were definitely passengers.

867
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:58,320
This plane is very safe.
Believe me.

868
00:44:58,321 --> 00:45:00,697
I gotta get to L.A. I don't have
time for this shit. Come on.

869
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:03,617
- I don't know, I don't know.
- Ray, Ray...

870
00:45:03,618 --> 00:45:05,202
- You don't know?
- No.

871
00:45:05,203 --> 00:45:06,786
- What is it? This airline?
- Yeah.

872
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:07,913
- Is it this airline?
- Yeah.

873
00:45:07,914 --> 00:45:10,457
Okay, fine. We can...

874
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:12,500
There's an American plane...

875
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:17,272
American Flight 625
crashed April 27, 1976.

876
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:19,466
We don't have to take American,
there's a lot of flights.

877
00:45:19,467 --> 00:45:21,009
Yeah. Pick another airline.

878
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:22,302
Continental.

879
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:25,263
Continental crashed
November 15, 1987.

880
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:28,738
Flight 1713. 28 casualties.

881
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:30,852
- This is very serious, Ray.
- Very serious.

882
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:32,646
You see, I have to
get to Los Angeles.

883
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:35,607
All right? So you're gonna get on
that plane, do you understand me?

884
00:45:35,608 --> 00:45:37,484
- Yeah.
- You're gonna have to get on a plane.

885
00:45:37,485 --> 00:45:39,945
Yeah, get on a plane.

886
00:45:39,946 --> 00:45:43,198
Now, there's a Delta.

887
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:46,076
It leaves at midnight,
Ray, but how's Delta?

888
00:45:46,077 --> 00:45:49,537
Delta crashed August 2,
1985. Lockheed L-1011.

889
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:50,830
- Dallas/Fort Worth.
- All right, Ray.

890
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:52,791
- Terrible wind shear. 135 passengers.
- All airlines!

891
00:45:52,792 --> 00:45:56,336
All airlines have crashed
at one time or another.

892
00:45:56,337 --> 00:45:57,837
That doesn't mean that
they are not safe.

893
00:45:57,838 --> 00:45:59,965
- Qantas.
- Qantas?

894
00:45:59,966 --> 00:46:02,592
Qantas never crashed.

895
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:05,316
- Qantas?
- Never crashed.

896
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:09,891
Well, that's... That's going
to do me a lot of good, Ray.

897
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:12,352
You see, Qantas doesn't fly
to L.A. out of Cincinnati.

898
00:46:12,353 --> 00:46:14,104
- You have gotta get to Melbourne.
- Australia.

899
00:46:14,105 --> 00:46:17,274
Melbourne, Australia in order to get
the plane that flies to Los Angeles!

900
00:46:17,275 --> 00:46:19,268
- Do you hear me?
- Canberra's the capital.

901

16.2 million population.
Very lovely beaches.

902
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:24,367
You and I are gonna get

903
00:46:24,368 --> 00:46:25,912
No.

904

We're not going to take the plane.
He's okay, he's okay!

906
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:40,547
He's okay. We're not
going to take the plane.

908
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:43,550
Just relax. He was...

909
00:46:43,551 --> 00:46:44,968
He was upset. We were
gonna take the plane.

910
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:47,178
We're not gonna take the plane now.
We're not gonna take the plane.

911
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:50,573
- We're not gonna fly, okay?
- No flying.

912
00:46:52,977 --> 00:46:56,354
- We're not gonna fly.
- No flying.

913
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:58,356
- You tire me, Ray.
- Yeah.

914
00:46:58,357 --> 00:47:01,568
We're going to drive to Los Angeles.
We're gonna drive to L.A.

915
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:03,528
Okay? Come on, Ray.

916
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:05,739
- Ray, come on.
- Yeah.

917
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:07,115
- Come on. Here.
- No flying.

918
00:47:07,116 --> 00:47:10,118
Take the bag. We're not gonna take the
plane, Ray. Just grab the fucking bag, man.

919
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:12,216
No flying.

920
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:15,832
You're killing me, Ray. I just want
you to know you are killing me, man.

921
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:17,709
- No flying.
- I got to be in L.A. in three hours,

922
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:19,878
it's gonna take me three days.

923
00:47:19,879 --> 00:47:22,773
Come on. Come on.

924
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:25,592
No flying.

925
00:47:25,593 --> 00:47:28,395
- No flying.
- No flying.

926
00:47:29,638 --> 00:47:32,557
Course, I got <i>Jeopardy!</i> at 5:00.

927
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:33,767
I watch <i>Jeopardy!</i> at 5:00.

928
00:47:33,768 --> 00:47:37,572
- Don't start with that.
- I've got <i>Jeopardy!</i> at 5:00.

929
00:48:10,805 --> 00:48:13,681
<i>- Dispatch, this is 1-0-9.
- Go ahead, 1-0-9.</i>

930
00:48:13,682 --> 00:48:16,601
<i>See if you can get another unit
up here for point control.</i>

931
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:19,780
<i>Two more over to you. 10-40.</i>

932
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:23,408
Come on. Let's go!

933
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:27,737
- Bring some more up.
<i>- What's your E.T.A.?</i>

934
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:29,539
Uh-oh.

935
00:48:30,199 --> 00:48:32,000
Ray.

936
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:34,632
- Ray, get in the car.
- Driving is dangerous.

937
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:37,914
Just get in the car.
Are you crazy? Huh?

938
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:39,416
We'll be outta this in a second.

939
00:48:39,417 --> 00:48:41,000
- Yeah.
- That's good.

940
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:43,253
It's okay. That's right.

941
00:48:43,254 --> 00:48:45,338
Yeah. We'll be outta here in
a few seconds. That's good.

942
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:47,006
That's good. That's good.

943
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:50,260
There's definitely a fatal
accident over there.

944
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:51,469
Ray. Ray.

945
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:53,870
Hey! We don't need your help
up here. Go on back to your car.

946
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:57,150
Just a minute!

947
00:48:57,476 --> 00:48:59,949
Ray. Ray. Ray.

948
00:49:00,688 --> 00:49:01,855
Ray.

949
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:05,024
Excuse... Hey!

950
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:07,193
- Just wait...
- There's nothing to see here.

951
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:08,528
Go back and get in your car.

952
00:49:08,529 --> 00:49:09,696
Yes, sir.

953
00:49:09,697 --> 00:49:11,906
- Wrecks just make him nervous.
- Fine. Go back and get in your car.

954
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:14,701
Yes, sir. Just stay there by
the side, okay, Raymond?

955
00:49:14,702 --> 00:49:16,703
- Ray! Listen, Ray. Just stay there.
- A lot of traffic.

956
00:49:16,704 --> 00:49:19,882
Yeah. Definitely a lot of traffic.

957
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:22,125
Hell of a lot of
work for $3 million.

958
00:49:22,126 --> 00:49:24,926
Just leave him on the goddamn highway
and just get the hell outta here.

959
00:49:26,005 --> 00:49:28,307
Yeah. What? I hear ya! I hear ya!

960
00:49:33,554 --> 00:49:35,571
Stay in your car!

961
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:44,063
What's it gonna be, Ray?
What's it gonna be?

962
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:46,232
This is a very dangerous highway.

963
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:47,734
How am I gonna get to L.A.?

964
00:49:47,735 --> 00:49:50,153
Course, driving a car on this
interstate is very dangerous.

965
00:49:50,154 --> 00:49:52,447
You wanna get off the highway?
Will that make you happy?

966
00:49:52,448 --> 00:49:54,449
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Well, you gotta get in the car

967
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:55,617
in order to get off the highway!

968
00:49:55,618 --> 00:49:59,968
Course, in 1986, 46,400 male drivers were
definitely involved in fatal accidents.

969
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:05,126
All right, I got an idea.
I got a great idea.

970
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:07,670
You'll stay in front of the car
until we get off the exit.

971
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:09,964
You'll get in, and we'll take
the not-so-dangerous road.

972
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:11,716
Whatever that might be.

973
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:13,092
- Is that an idea?
- Yeah.

974
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:15,053
Come on. Give me five,
Ray. That's a great idea.

975
00:50:15,054 --> 00:50:16,596
- Yeah.
- Give me five. Yeah. Yeah.

976
00:50:16,597 --> 00:50:19,070
This guy's a fuckin' fruitcake.

977
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:29,275
I'm asking you. Who's on first?
That's the man's name.

978
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:31,861
That's whose name? Yes.
Go ahead and tell me.

979
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:34,948
Who? The guy on first.
Who? The first baseman.

980
00:50:34,949 --> 00:50:36,658
Who is on first.

981
00:50:36,659 --> 00:50:39,118
Whose wife? Yes.

982
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:41,246
After all, the man
earns it. Who does?

983
00:50:41,247 --> 00:50:42,288
Absolutely.

984
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:45,041
All I'm tryin' to find out is what
the guy's name on first base.

985
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:46,918
No. What is on second base.

986
00:50:46,919 --> 00:50:49,963
I'm not asking you who's on
second base. Who's on first?

987
00:50:49,964 --> 00:50:51,297
That's what I'm tryin' to find out.

988
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:52,423
Get the hell in the car!

989
00:50:52,424 --> 00:50:54,551
Don't change the players.
Yeah, get in the car.

990
00:50:54,552 --> 00:50:56,052
Get in the car.

991
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:57,720
Course, I have to
be in bed by 11:00.

992
00:50:57,721 --> 00:51:00,774
Lights out at 11:00.
Have to watch TV.

993
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:08,189
Course, now it's almost
19 minutes to 11:00.

994
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:10,024
I have to be in bed
at 11:00. Lights out.

995
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:12,485
Don't start with this. We're not flying.
We're not on the interstate.

996
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:15,446
I'm on some shit secondary road.
I gotta make up some time.

997
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:16,489
I gotta get to Los Angeles.

998
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:18,700
I should have been there this
afternoon. My business needs me.

999
00:51:18,701 --> 00:51:20,326
I gotta make up some time.

1000
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:21,369
Definitely watch TV,

1001
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:23,621
but you have to be in
bed at 11:00. Lights out.

1002
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:24,706
Forget it.

1003
00:51:24,707 --> 00:51:27,475
Uh-oh, 19 minutes to 11:00.

1004
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:42,307
This is a good one.

1005
00:51:42,308 --> 00:51:43,641
"We don't go out when it rains."

1006
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:46,019
This is a real good one, Ray.
I hope you appreciate this,

1007
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:48,688
because my business is going
down the fuckin' toilet.

1008
00:51:48,689 --> 00:51:50,356
I should be in L.A.

1009
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:54,319
Instead, I'm in the Honeymoon Haven
Motel in Bumblefuck, Missouri,

1010
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,738
because you won't go
out when it rains.

1011
00:51:56,739 --> 00:51:59,866
It's mystifying. I mean,
it's fucking mystifying.

1012
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:04,871
What is this?

1013
00:52:04,872 --> 00:52:07,015
Good news, bad news?

1014
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:08,875
We passed DOT, but failed EPA.

1015
00:52:08,876 --> 00:52:11,336
It all ends up the same.
I can't get my money.

1016
00:52:11,337 --> 00:52:14,672
Yes, sir, I'm just stuck in
Cincinnati since the funeral.

1017
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:16,132
So many leftover details.

1018
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:18,509
My family is, needless to say,

1019
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:20,219
quite overwhelmed.

1020
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:22,555
Thank you. I appreciate it.

1021
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:25,391
Well, it is a shock,
to say the least.

1022
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:28,436
Thank you. Is there any way I can
get an extension on that loan?

1023
00:52:28,437 --> 00:52:30,396
Just a couple of days.

1024
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:32,190
It would make a world
of difference.

1025
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:41,211
"We don't go out
when it's raining."

1026
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:47,914
What? Speak up, Lenny.

1027
00:52:47,915 --> 00:52:49,749
Lenny, I bought time,
I didn't buy that kind of time.

1028
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:52,085
What I want you to do is you're
gonna have to... How much?

1029
00:52:52,086 --> 00:52:53,544
- Course, it's 12:30.
- What?

1030
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:54,879
Lunch is 12:30.

1031
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:57,715
- Hold on. What do you want for lunch?
- Wednesday's fish sticks.

1032
00:52:57,716 --> 00:53:00,314
- Fish sticks?
- Green lime JELL-O for dessert.

1033
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:02,261
Green lime JELL-O.
Want another apple juice?

1034
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:05,598
I want orange soda. Oh, it's 12:31.

1035
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:07,016
I gotta go. He's starting
to rock and moan.

1036
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:10,019
- Yeah, it's definitely 12:32.
- It's okay. No.

1037
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:21,739
Course, there's four fish sticks.

1038
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,282
There's supposed to
be eight fish sticks.

1039
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:25,910
Eight? There's eight.

1040
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:28,955
You take a shower, Ray? Hmm? Ray?

1041
00:53:28,956 --> 00:53:30,707
- Ray, you take a shower, right?
- Yeah.

1042
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:31,791
- Right?
- Yeah.

1043
00:53:31,792 --> 00:53:34,094
It's the same as the rain.
You get a little wet.

1044
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:36,963
What do you say, Ray?
What do you say? Huh?

1045
00:53:36,964 --> 00:53:39,107
Course, the shower's
in the bathroom.

1046
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:42,393
That's the end of
that conversation.

1047
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:44,470
<i>- Go again.
- British Poetry for 200, please.</i>

1048
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:46,222
<i>The answer at the top
of the category.</i>

1049
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:49,809
<i>"Shakespeare wrote over 150
poems in this 14-line form."</i>

1050
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:51,769
- What is a sonnet?
<i>- What is a sonnet?</i>

1051
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:54,230
<i>- You got it.
- Let's try Double Letters for 200.</i>

1052
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:55,440
<i>The top of that one.</i>

1053
00:53:55,441 --> 00:53:58,317
<i>"The last word in the
Pledge of Allegiance." Mark.</i>

1054
00:53:58,318 --> 00:53:59,610
<i>- What is "stands"?
- No.</i>

1055
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:06,089
Stu, legally, Bruner never established
a conservatorship of Raymond?

1056
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:10,288
He didn't figure anyone would
show up to contest his authority.

1057
00:54:10,289 --> 00:54:13,416
If that's the case,
I definitely will get custody

1058
00:54:13,417 --> 00:54:15,376
- and the $3 million, right?
<i>- Possibly.</i>

1059
00:54:15,377 --> 00:54:19,839
Then you set up a date
for the custody hearing.

1060
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:23,009
Stu, I want a firm date,
and I want it early.

1061
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:24,719
<i>I found that it was
an original record,</i>

1062
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:27,138
<i>because the original
song had two verses...</i>

1063
00:54:27,139 --> 00:54:30,567
Lenny, she hasn't come
in, she hasn't called?

1064
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:32,351
If you see her or hear from her,

1065
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:34,574
tell her to call me at this number.

1066
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:49,590
<i>The Air Alpha Force, from Nike.</i>

1067
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:55,416
Would you look at that? 1957
Studebaker Golden Hawk.

1068
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:57,126
Zero to 60 in under eight seconds.

1069
00:54:57,127 --> 00:55:00,338
275 supercharged horsepower
under that hood.

1070
00:55:00,339 --> 00:55:02,381
- That's beautiful.
- Course, I'm an excellent driver.

1071
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:04,684
- You know how to drive?
- Yeah.

1072
00:55:05,469 --> 00:55:06,552
When did you drive?

1073
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:07,845
Course, I drove the
Buick on the driveway

1074
00:55:07,846 --> 00:55:10,364
when my dad came to Wallbrook.

1075
00:55:11,225 --> 00:55:13,559
Was Dad in the car?
Was Dad in the car, Ray?

1076
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,361
Yeah.

1077
00:55:16,688 --> 00:55:17,897
And he let you drive the Buick?

1078
00:55:17,898 --> 00:55:20,291
Yeah, slow on the driveway.

1079
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:23,861
I'll have to let you
drive sometime.

1080
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:26,280
Raymond! Raymond! Raymond!

1081
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:28,741
You never, never touch the
steering wheel when I'm driving!

1082
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:30,701
- Do you hear me?
- Yeah.

1083
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:33,095
Course, I don't have my underwear.

1084
00:55:33,205 --> 00:55:35,748
- What?
- I'm definitely not wearing my underwear.

1085
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:36,874
What are you talking about?

1086
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:37,917
I gave you a fresh pair
of mine this morning.

1087
00:55:37,918 --> 00:55:40,015
Not my underwear.

1088
00:55:40,087 --> 00:55:42,630
I told you to go in the bathroom
and put them on. Where are they?

1089
00:55:42,631 --> 00:55:44,924
Course, they're in the
pocket of my jacket.

1090
00:55:44,925 --> 00:55:47,022
- Where?
- Here.

1091
00:55:47,636 --> 00:55:49,011
These are too tight.

1092
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:50,638
- I don't want them back, Ray.
- These are not boxer shorts.

1093
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:51,764
Mine are boxer shorts.

1094
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:55,184
- What's the difference?
- These are Hanes 32.

1095
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:56,602
My boxer shorts have my name.

1096
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:58,271
- It says "Raymond."
- All right.

1097
00:55:58,272 --> 00:56:00,523
When we pass a store, we'll pick
you up a pair of boxer shorts.

1098
00:56:00,524 --> 00:56:03,359
I get my boxer shorts
at Kmart in Cincinnati.

1099
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,736
We're not going back to Cincinnati,
Ray, so don't even start with that.

1100
00:56:05,737 --> 00:56:06,863
400 Oak Street.

1101
00:56:06,864 --> 00:56:07,947
You're not going
back to Cincinnati.

1102
00:56:07,948 --> 00:56:10,157
You don't have to go to Cincinnati
to pick up boxer shorts.

1103
00:56:10,158 --> 00:56:12,285
- It's Oak and Burnett, in Cincinnati.
- What did I say, Ray?

1104
00:56:12,286 --> 00:56:13,411
It's Kmart.

1105
00:56:13,412 --> 00:56:15,872
You hear me. I know you hear me.

1106
00:56:15,873 --> 00:56:18,291
You don't fool me with
this shit for a second.

1107
00:56:18,292 --> 00:56:19,458
Yours are too tight.

1108
00:56:19,459 --> 00:56:21,961
Ray, did you fuckin'
hear what I said?

1109
00:56:21,962 --> 00:56:24,764
- Shut up!
- Yeah.

1110
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:29,135
Cincinnati's a long way off.

1111
00:56:29,136 --> 00:56:31,721
We're getting further
away from Kmart.

1112
00:56:31,722 --> 00:56:34,140
You don't have to go to Cincinnati
to get a pair of underwear at Kmart.

1113
00:56:34,141 --> 00:56:36,309
You have to go to Kmart.
400 Oak Street.

1114
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:38,811
What'd I tell you, Ray? We're not
going to Cincinnati. That's final.

1115
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:39,896
I get my boxer shorts at Kmart.

1116
00:56:39,897 --> 00:56:41,606
Raymond, that is final!
Do you hear me?

1117
00:56:41,607 --> 00:56:43,624
I'm gonna be short-less.

1118
00:56:51,909 --> 00:56:53,200
What difference does it make...

1119
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:56,287
What difference does it make
where you buy underwear?

1120
00:56:56,288 --> 00:56:57,538
What difference does it make?

1121
00:56:57,539 --> 00:56:59,665
Underwear is underwear!

1122
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:01,751
It is underwear
wherever you buy it!

1123
00:57:01,752 --> 00:57:04,128
In Cincinnati or wherever!

1124
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:05,212
Kmart.

1125
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:07,590
- You know what I think, Ray?
- Kmart.

1126
00:57:07,591 --> 00:57:09,842
I think this autism
is a bunch of shit!

1127
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:12,929
'Cause you can't tell me
you're not in there somewhere!

1128
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:15,181
Boxer shorts.

1129
00:57:15,182 --> 00:57:17,859
Boxer shorts at Kmart.

1130
00:57:18,018 --> 00:57:21,062
These are... These are Hanes 32.

1131
00:57:21,063 --> 00:57:23,397
- You're driving me crazy.
- Mine are boxer shorts.

1132
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:26,067
We're gonna have to make a little
stop and find a psychiatrist.

1133
00:57:26,068 --> 00:57:27,526
You're driving me crazy.

1134
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:29,362
Oak and Burnett, that's
where the shorts are.

1135
00:57:29,363 --> 00:57:30,613
'Cause you are driving me crazy.

1136
00:57:30,614 --> 00:57:32,198
We have to buy them at
Kmart, Oak and Burnett.

1137
00:57:32,199 --> 00:57:34,951
We have to buy them
back in... Uh-oh.

1138
00:57:34,952 --> 00:57:37,370
Course, your shorts
are on the highway.

1139
00:57:37,371 --> 00:57:40,344
Let's go back to Cincinnati. Kmart.

1140
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:08,538
Good luck trying to find
a shrink in this town.

1141
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:41,150
Raymond?

1142
00:59:23,351 --> 00:59:26,312
Hey, you. Hey, dipshit, move it!

1143
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:31,525
If you ain't gonna
move, I'll move you.

1144
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:33,486
Hey, buddy. Hey, you!

1145
00:59:33,487 --> 00:59:35,821
- You're gonna get run over out here.
- Hey! Hey!

1146
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:37,782
- You're gonna get hurt. Come on.
- It said, "Don't walk."

1147
00:59:37,783 --> 00:59:40,451
- Hey! Do you hear me?
- Yeah. It said, "Don't walk."

1148
00:59:40,452 --> 00:59:41,619
Move it. Move it.

1149
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:43,954
Hey, it's all right, sir.

1150
00:59:43,955 --> 00:59:45,998
I'm sorry. He's from
out of town. Raymond?

1151
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:47,666
- Come on.
- Yeah.

1152
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:50,002
- It's all right.
- Gotta get to Kmart.

1153
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:52,505
Raymond, Raymond, come on.

1154
00:59:52,506 --> 00:59:54,173
Kmart, 400 Oak Street.

1155
00:59:54,174 --> 00:59:55,508
It said, "Don't walk."

1156
00:59:55,509 --> 00:59:56,592
Yes, it's broken.

1157
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:58,394
It said, "Don't walk."

1158
00:59:59,346 --> 01:00:01,222
- This way.
- Have to get to Kmart.

1159
01:00:01,223 --> 01:00:03,474
400 Oak and Burnett.

1160
01:00:03,475 --> 01:00:05,276
Oak and Burnett.

1161
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:09,814
He said, "Young man, go west,"

1162
01:00:09,815 --> 01:00:12,191
and this is the way
our country developed

1163
01:00:12,192 --> 01:00:15,027
from the East Coast
to the West Coast.

1164
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:21,050
During that period of
time there was initiated

1165
01:00:21,993 --> 01:00:24,912
what was known as the Pony Express.

1166
01:00:24,913 --> 01:00:26,872
I'm sure all of you have
read something about it

1167
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:28,666
in the history of
the United States.

1168
01:00:28,667 --> 01:00:31,502
I may not have the days
exactly right or the years,

1169
01:00:31,503 --> 01:00:36,399
but I'm more or less familiar with
the history of the United States.

1170
01:00:37,551 --> 01:00:39,176
He's "artistic"?

1171
01:00:39,177 --> 01:00:41,053
No, he's autistic.

1172
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:43,389
I'm not familiar with that.

1173
01:00:43,390 --> 01:00:45,641
What is the exact
nature of the problem?

1174
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:49,862
He lives in a world of his own.

1175
01:00:50,147 --> 01:00:54,024
I'm sorry, but what's
wrong with him?

1176
01:00:54,025 --> 01:00:56,277
It was a problem gettin'
mail from the East Coast...

1177
01:00:56,278 --> 01:00:58,529
Raymond, do a little of your
"What's On First?" for her.

1178
01:00:58,530 --> 01:01:00,531
Who's on first. What's on second.

1179
01:01:00,532 --> 01:01:02,333
Huh?

1180
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:07,121
They set up an initial program

1181
01:01:07,122 --> 01:01:09,248
where the Pony Express

1182
01:01:09,249 --> 01:01:13,428
would ride for
approximately 20 miles...

1183
01:01:15,255 --> 01:01:16,422
What am I supposed to do?

1184
01:01:16,423 --> 01:01:19,225
There's gotta be something
that I can do here.

1185
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:20,926
I'm not a psychiatrist,

1186
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:23,762
but I do know that his brain
doesn't work like other people.

1187
01:01:23,763 --> 01:01:25,931
What he does isn't
intended to be annoying.

1188
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:29,059
If he's getting on your nerves,
you just take a break.

1189
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:30,227
Spend time away from him.

1190
01:01:30,228 --> 01:01:31,937
Sure, I'll just send him back.

1191
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:33,063
- Sorry?
- Nothing,

1192
01:01:33,064 --> 01:01:34,732
just kidding, it's an inside joke.

1193
01:01:34,733 --> 01:01:36,859
You're telling me I just have to
deal with this stuff, is that it?

1194
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:39,445
I just gotta deal with this stuff.

1195
01:01:39,446 --> 01:01:41,793
Yeah, that's about it.

1196
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:46,169
Out of curiosity, does he
have any special abilities?

1197
01:01:47,162 --> 01:01:49,079
Well, he's got a
pretty good memory.

1198
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:51,373
He counts toothpicks.

1199
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:53,918
He spilled a box of
toothpicks on the floor.

1200
01:01:53,919 --> 01:01:56,545
He took one look at them and he
knew exactly how many there were.

1201
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:58,689
He counted them in seconds.

1202
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:00,007
Ray?

1203
01:02:00,008 --> 01:02:01,467
- Raymond?
- Yeah.

1204
01:02:01,468 --> 01:02:03,344
Are you good with numbers?

1205
01:02:03,345 --> 01:02:04,803
Yeah.

1206
01:02:04,804 --> 01:02:07,223
I read about this. I want
to try something here.

1207
01:02:07,224 --> 01:02:08,557
Kmart. 400 Oak Street.

1208
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:10,726
What did I tell you? After
this, Raymond. After this.

1209
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:13,312
- Ray, can we try something?
- Yeah.

1210
01:02:13,313 --> 01:02:19,443
Do you know how much
312 times 123 is?

1211
01:02:19,444 --> 01:02:21,862
38,376.

1212
01:02:21,863 --> 01:02:23,239
He's right.

1213
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:24,823
- What?
- He's right.

1214
01:02:24,824 --> 01:02:25,950
- He's right?
- Yeah.

1215
01:02:25,951 --> 01:02:30,287
Ray, how much is 4,343

1216
01:02:30,288 --> 01:02:33,540
times 1,234?

1217
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:35,793
5,359,262.

1218
01:02:35,794 --> 01:02:38,096
- He's a genius.
- That's right.

1219
01:02:38,505 --> 01:02:39,588
He's a genius.

1220
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:45,520
Ray, do you know how much the
square root of 2,130 is?

1221
01:02:45,553 --> 01:02:50,182
46.15192304.

1222
01:02:50,183 --> 01:02:51,475
2304.

1223
01:02:51,476 --> 01:02:52,935
That's amazing.

1224
01:02:52,936 --> 01:02:56,865
That is amazing. He should work
for NASA or something like that.

1225
01:02:57,774 --> 01:03:01,360
If you had a dollar, and
you spent 50 cents,

1226
01:03:01,361 --> 01:03:03,913
how much money would you have left?

1227
01:03:07,367 --> 01:03:08,993
About 70.

1228
01:03:08,994 --> 01:03:10,577
- 70 cents?
- 70 cents.

1229
01:03:10,578 --> 01:03:12,037
So much for the NASA idea.

1230
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:14,081
Kmart. We should go to Kmart.

1231
01:03:14,082 --> 01:03:15,374
What'd I tell ya? After this, Ray.

1232
01:03:15,375 --> 01:03:17,293
400 Oak Street.

1233
01:03:17,294 --> 01:03:20,222
Ray, do you know how
much a candy bar costs?

1234
01:03:20,297 --> 01:03:21,672
About $100.

1235
01:03:21,673 --> 01:03:23,173
- $100, huh?
- Yeah.

1236
01:03:23,174 --> 01:03:25,342
Do you know how much one of
those new compact cars cost?

1237
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:27,520
About $100.

1238
01:03:28,346 --> 01:03:32,057
In his particular case, he's pretty
well-off, he's very high-functioning.

1239
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:35,987
Most autistics, they can't speak
or they can't communicate.

1240
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:38,439
- Ray?
- Yeah.

1241
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:40,858
- Do you know what autistic is?
- Yeah.

1242
01:03:40,859 --> 01:03:43,252
- You know that word?
- Yeah.

1243
01:03:44,404 --> 01:03:46,831
Are you autistic?

1244
01:03:47,991 --> 01:03:50,168
I don't think so.

1245
01:03:50,285 --> 01:03:54,180
No, definitely not.

1246
01:03:57,917 --> 01:03:59,293
<i>...problem with the
Lamborghinis, Charlie.</i>

1247
01:03:59,294 --> 01:04:01,378
Just shut up a second. Let
me see if I understood this.

1248
01:04:01,379 --> 01:04:02,463
Very small. Yeah.

1249
01:04:02,464 --> 01:04:04,757
It's gonna cost me $10,000
additional for each car.

1250
01:04:04,758 --> 01:04:06,258
- Course, it's very crowded in here.
- Is that...

1251
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:09,094
- It's very crowded in here.
- Ray, please, just one second, okay?

1252
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:10,763
Huh? What?

1253
01:04:10,764 --> 01:04:13,057
They wanna take out the
manifold and the carburetors

1254
01:04:13,058 --> 01:04:15,184
in order to put in a fuel
injection system now?

1255
01:04:15,185 --> 01:04:16,560
I mean, that is nonsense.

1256
01:04:16,561 --> 01:04:17,936
<i>- I know that you're upset.</i>
- What are you doing?

1257
01:04:17,937 --> 01:04:20,606
- Too crowded in here for a backpack.
- Just leave this on.

1258
01:04:20,607 --> 01:04:23,776
Yeah. It's gonna cost me
$40,000 just to meet EPA now.

1259
01:04:23,777 --> 01:04:25,778
What? No. No. No.

1260
01:04:25,779 --> 01:04:29,698
You give me the number. I'm gonna
call the conversion shop myself.

1261
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:31,575
That's my pen. That's
definitely my book.

1262
01:04:31,576 --> 01:04:33,786
Taking your book is
not a serious injury.

1263
01:04:33,787 --> 01:04:36,080
For serious injury, look at the
red book. That book is blue.

1264
01:04:36,081 --> 01:04:39,166
Forgive me. I've lost my
secret decoder ring. 4-5-4-5.

1265
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:41,794
- You're already number 18. In 1988.
- Got it. 1988, I know.

1266
01:04:41,795 --> 01:04:43,796
It's my book. That's my pen.

1267
01:04:43,797 --> 01:04:45,923
Uh-oh. 12 minutes to Wapner.

1268
01:04:45,924 --> 01:04:47,800
It's definitely very small in here.

1269
01:04:47,801 --> 01:04:50,219
Small... and safe.

1270
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:51,345
You don't wanna miss the party.

1271
01:04:51,346 --> 01:04:52,554
What you're witnessing is real.

1272
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:55,198
Do you know that? There's a
party in your honor, Ray.

1273
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:58,769
When we get to L.A., a custody hearing.
My lawyer's setting it up right now.

1274
01:04:58,770 --> 01:05:01,647
You know why there's a party for you?
Because you're the 3-million-dollar man.

1275
01:05:01,648 --> 01:05:03,065
What you are witnessing is real.

1276
01:05:03,066 --> 01:05:04,149
Ken Aldorf.

1277
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:05,651
- The participants are not actors.
- Charlie Babbitt.

1278
01:05:05,652 --> 01:05:06,985
Uh-oh. Fart.

1279
01:05:06,986 --> 01:05:08,404
Yeah, Charlie Babbitt. I'll hold.

1280
01:05:08,405 --> 01:05:09,655
Uh-oh. Fart.

1281
01:05:09,656 --> 01:05:11,365
- Did you fart, Raymond?
- Fart.

1282
01:05:11,366 --> 01:05:13,383
- Did you fuckin' fart?
- Fart.

1283
01:05:13,451 --> 01:05:16,299
Oh, man. Get the smell out.

1284
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:18,747
- How can you stand that?
- I don't mind it.

1285
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:20,124
How can you stand that?

1286
01:05:20,125 --> 01:05:21,834
- Yeah, Ken.
- Ten minutes to Wapner.

1287
01:05:21,835 --> 01:05:23,627
Ken? How are you?
This is Charlie Babbitt.

1288
01:05:23,628 --> 01:05:25,254
We're definitely locked
in this box with no TV.

1289
01:05:25,255 --> 01:05:27,464
I just heard about this
$10,000 charge for every car.

1290
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:30,384
- They're definitely gonna start...
- How can this be?

1291
01:05:30,385 --> 01:05:33,011
- How can this possibly happen right now?
<i>- The People's Court</i> starts...

1292
01:05:33,012 --> 01:05:34,805
- I don't know.
- You're telling me another $40,000.

1293
01:05:34,806 --> 01:05:37,558
They start on the button. They
definitely start on the button.

1294
01:05:37,559 --> 01:05:40,310
I've got a problem. I'm gonna have
to call you back from my next stop.

1295
01:05:40,311 --> 01:05:43,272
- We're not gonna make it to the program.
- Okay, my next stop.

1296
01:05:43,273 --> 01:05:45,357
- Definitely have to go now.
- Yes, we're going, Ray.

1297
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:48,152
- Just take it easy. Just take it easy.
- Eight minutes to Wapner.

1298
01:05:48,153 --> 01:05:50,529
Where am I gonna find a
television around here?

1299
01:05:50,530 --> 01:05:53,833
- Eight minutes to Wapner.
- We got eight minutes to Wapner.

1300
01:06:10,383 --> 01:06:12,184
Come on. Come on.

1301
01:06:13,303 --> 01:06:16,763
You wanna get in there and see
the show? Huh? Huh, Raymond?

1302
01:06:16,764 --> 01:06:18,724
Wanna get in there and see
the show? Then listen up.

1303
01:06:18,725 --> 01:06:22,369
There's not another farmhouse
in sight. This is it, man.

1304
01:06:24,731 --> 01:06:26,648
You act weird, we don't get in.
You listening to me?

1305
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:27,858
Yeah.

1306
01:06:27,859 --> 01:06:30,986
I want you to look normal. As
normal as possible, all right?

1307
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:33,739
Just put your hands down.
Don't rock and moan.

1308
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:36,033
- Four minutes to Wapner.
- Just shut up and stand there.

1309
01:06:36,034 --> 01:06:37,868
Yeah. Uh...

1310
01:06:37,869 --> 01:06:41,548
Raymond, don't rock and moan.
Put your hands down.

1311
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:47,769
Good afternoon, ma'am. I'm Donald
Clemons from the A.C. Nielsen Company.

1312
01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:49,755
You're familiar with our work?

1313
01:06:49,756 --> 01:06:51,965
Nielsen... I... You
mean the TV ratings?

1314
01:06:51,966 --> 01:06:54,760
Yes, ma'am. That's exactly it. You've
been selected as a preliminary candidate

1315
01:06:54,761 --> 01:06:58,096
to become our next Nielsen
family in the tri-county area.

1316
01:06:58,097 --> 01:06:59,619
- My husband's not home.
- If selected...

1317
01:06:59,620 --> 01:07:02,985
you'll share the responsibility for
shaping television programming

1318
01:07:02,986 --> 01:07:04,845
viewed by our entire nation

1319
01:07:04,896 --> 01:07:09,775
in return for which you'll receive a
check in the amount of $286 each month.

1320
01:07:09,776 --> 01:07:11,235
Who's he?

1321
01:07:11,236 --> 01:07:16,758
That would be my partner,
Mr. Bainbridge, who does sample...

1322
01:07:19,619 --> 01:07:21,245
- Oh, boy.
- That's it.

1323
01:07:21,246 --> 01:07:23,664
You blew it. You don't
get to see your program.

1324
01:07:23,665 --> 01:07:25,290
- It's finished.
- One minute to Wapner.

1325
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:28,001
One minute to Wapner. One minute
to Wapner. One minute to Wapner.

1326
01:07:28,002 --> 01:07:30,045
I had you in there, Ray!
You were in there.

1327
01:07:31,297 --> 01:07:33,632
Defendants! Plaintiffs!
You had it all!

1328
01:07:33,633 --> 01:07:36,176
- Uh-oh.
- They're in there making legal history, Ray.

1329
01:07:36,177 --> 01:07:38,470
- Legal history.
- Oh! Oh, boy!

1330
01:07:38,471 --> 01:07:39,638
Oh, boy.

1331
01:07:39,639 --> 01:07:41,056
What is going on out here?

1332
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:42,766
- I'm sorry, ma'am. I lied to you.
- It's gonna be on.

1333
01:07:42,767 --> 01:07:45,477
I am very sorry about that. That
man right there is my brother.

1334
01:07:45,478 --> 01:07:47,896
If he doesn't watch <i>People's
Court</i> in about 30 seconds

1335
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:49,648
he's gonna throw a fit
right here on your porch.

1336
01:07:49,649 --> 01:07:52,918
Now, you can help me, or you can
stand there and watch it happen.

1337
01:07:54,028 --> 01:07:57,126
We like to watch cartoons.
You think he'd settle for that?

1338
01:07:57,824 --> 01:08:00,626
<i>...and she sees an identical twin.</i>

1339
01:08:00,994 --> 01:08:03,829
<i>True, he didn't have his
shirt on, the other one did,</i>

1340
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:06,456
<i>but they sure look alike to me.</i>

1341
01:08:06,457 --> 01:08:10,502
<i>If it got on his chest, even if
it didn't burn or got real cold</i>

1342
01:08:10,503 --> 01:08:13,171
<i>- I put my hand on the dry ice.</i>
- Daddy's not here now.

1343
01:08:13,172 --> 01:08:17,092
<i>I wanted to take it off quickly
because it got very cold.</i>

1344
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:20,178
<i>I also confess, I was afraid
I might burn my hand.</i>

1345
01:08:20,179 --> 01:08:22,139
<i>If I take it and put it up
against a bare chest...</i>

1346
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:25,392
Gary, work with me on this one. Believe
me, I'm gonna take care of you.

1347
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:31,323
- You know that song?
<i>- My judgment is for the...</i>

1348
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:36,653
<i>We'll be back for the
audience reaction</i>

1349
01:08:36,654 --> 01:08:40,549
<i>to Judge Wapner's decision
right after these messages.</i>

1350
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:47,873
<i>The head bone connected
from the neck bone</i>

1351
01:08:47,874 --> 01:08:51,543
<i>The neck bone connected
from the shoulder bone</i>

1352
01:08:51,544 --> 01:08:54,880
<i>The shoulder bone connected

1353
01:08:54,881 --> 01:08:58,508

1354
01:08:58,509 --> 01:09:02,220

1357
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:12,814
<i>The leg bone connected
from the ankle bone</i>

1358
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:16,915
<i>The ankle bone connected
from the heel bone</i>

1359
01:09:17,195 --> 01:09:19,872
- My credit card's been rejected?
- Yes, sir.

1360
01:09:19,873 --> 01:09:21,098
Must be some accounting error.

1361
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:23,241
- How much is this gonna cost?
- $20, sir.

1362
01:09:23,242 --> 01:09:25,202
<i>Hear the word of the Lord</i>

1363
01:09:25,203 --> 01:09:27,579
<i>Oh, dem bones, dem bones</i>

1364
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:28,872
Thank you.

1365
01:09:28,873 --> 01:09:35,837
<i>Dem bones, dem bones</i>

1366
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:39,858
<i>Now hear the word of the Lord</i>

1367
01:09:50,561 --> 01:09:57,243
<i>Hear the word of the Lord</i>

1368
01:10:08,162 --> 01:10:09,996
Course, I'm never going back.
It's gonna be a long time.

1369
01:10:09,997 --> 01:10:12,290
It's definitely going
to be a long journey.

1370
01:10:12,291 --> 01:10:13,875
Just a couple of more days, Ray.

1371
01:10:13,876 --> 01:10:16,628
Yeah... You know the fella's name?
Then who's playing first?

1372
01:10:16,629 --> 01:10:18,714
You mean the fellow playing
first base for St. Louis?

1373
01:10:18,715 --> 01:10:20,716
We're gonna start with this again,
Ray? It's just another motel.

1374
01:10:20,717 --> 01:10:22,759
You gotta do this every time?

1375
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:24,970
That's the man's name.
That's whose name?

1376
01:10:24,971 --> 01:10:27,597
What are you asking me for?
I'm not asking you. I'm telling you.

1377
01:10:27,598 --> 01:10:29,057
Who's on first.

1378
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:30,726
I'm asking you who's on first.

1379
01:10:30,727 --> 01:10:32,352
Yo, Ray.

1380
01:10:32,353 --> 01:10:34,646
Ray, this is not...
It's not a riddle.

1381
01:10:34,647 --> 01:10:37,498
Yeah. You know the fellow's name?
Then who's playing first?

1382
01:10:37,499 --> 01:10:41,528
You're never gonna figure out who's on
first base, because Who is on first base.

1383
01:10:41,529 --> 01:10:43,196
That's a joke, Ray. It's comedy.

1384
01:10:43,197 --> 01:10:45,782
Sometimes his wife comes down
and collects it. Whose wife?

1385
01:10:45,783 --> 01:10:48,631
- It's comedy, man.
- Every dollar of it.

1386
01:10:48,703 --> 01:10:50,787
You got a first baseman
on first? Yeah.

1387
01:10:50,788 --> 01:10:52,497
It's a routine between
Abbott and Costello.

1388
01:10:52,498 --> 01:10:53,957
When you do it, you're not funny.

1389
01:10:53,958 --> 01:10:56,501
You're the comedy team
of Abbott and Abbott.

1390
01:10:56,502 --> 01:10:57,836
You understand what I'm saying?

1391
01:10:57,837 --> 01:10:59,337
Sometimes his wife comes
down and collects it.

1392
01:10:59,338 --> 01:11:00,714
Whose wife? Yeah.

1393
01:11:00,715 --> 01:11:04,885
Ray, you are never
going to solve it.

1394
01:11:04,886 --> 01:11:08,180
You know why you're never gonna
solve it? 'Cause it's not a riddle, man.

1395
01:11:08,181 --> 01:11:11,683
If you understood that, if you
understood that it's funny,

1396
01:11:11,684 --> 01:11:13,101
you might get better.

1397
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:16,438
All I'm trying to find out is,
what's the guy's name on first base?

1398
01:11:16,439 --> 01:11:18,106
What's the guy's
name on first base?

1399
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:19,858
No. What's the guy's
name on second base.

1400
01:11:19,859 --> 01:11:22,110
Have you got a first
baseman on first? Yeah.

1401
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:24,538
Then who's playing first? Yeah.

1402
01:11:25,239 --> 01:11:27,365
Who's... You know the
fellow's name? Yeah.

1403
01:11:27,366 --> 01:11:28,617
Then who's playing first?

1404
01:11:28,618 --> 01:11:30,994
The fella playing for St. Louis?

1405
01:11:30,995 --> 01:11:32,662
Who. The guy on first.

1406
01:11:32,663 --> 01:11:34,206
The first baseman. Who's on first.

1407
01:11:34,207 --> 01:11:35,832
What are you asking me for?

1408
01:11:35,833 --> 01:11:37,876
Have you got a first
baseman on first? Yeah.

1409
01:11:37,877 --> 01:11:39,377
All right, Ray. Come on.

1410
01:11:39,378 --> 01:11:42,297
We're gonna put the bed by
the window the way you like.

1411
01:11:42,298 --> 01:11:43,840
We got your apple juice.

1412
01:11:43,841 --> 01:11:48,011
We're gonna take the pens and paper out,
we're gonna put 'em on the table...

1413
01:11:48,012 --> 01:11:49,221
What's the matter, Ray,
did I forget something?

1414
01:11:49,222 --> 01:11:50,347
Cheese balls.

1415
01:11:50,348 --> 01:11:53,308
- Yes, I forgot the cheese balls.
- Definitely have cheese balls.

1416
01:11:53,309 --> 01:11:54,518
But we got them.

1417
01:11:54,519 --> 01:11:56,686
I have to have 12 cheese balls.

1418
01:11:56,687 --> 01:11:58,104
I have to get my tartar
control toothpaste.

1419
01:11:58,105 --> 01:12:00,232
We got that. I got that for
you a couple of days ago.

1420
01:12:00,233 --> 01:12:02,501
Where's my tartar
control toothpaste?

1421
01:12:03,736 --> 01:12:05,788
Raymond.

1422
01:12:07,114 --> 01:12:09,366
Raymond, remember when that doctor
asked you those questions today?

1423
01:12:09,367 --> 01:12:11,493
- The number questions?
- Yeah.

1424
01:12:11,494 --> 01:12:13,036
How did you do that?

1425
01:12:13,037 --> 01:12:14,579
- I see it.
- Huh?

1426
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:16,206
I see it.

1427
01:12:16,207 --> 01:12:17,374
What's that?

1428
01:12:17,375 --> 01:12:20,168
- Will you stop that for a second?
- I see it.

1429
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:21,503
Just put that down, will you?

1430
01:12:21,504 --> 01:12:22,754
I'm trying to talk to you.

1431
01:12:22,755 --> 01:12:24,673
When I say stop it, why
don't you stop it?

1432
01:12:24,674 --> 01:12:27,568
Why do you always have
to act like an idiot?

1433
01:12:29,011 --> 01:12:30,428
- You think that's funny?
- Yeah.

1434
01:12:30,429 --> 01:12:32,430
Funny Rain Man. Funny teeth.

1435
01:12:32,431 --> 01:12:33,598
What did you say?

1436
01:12:33,599 --> 01:12:35,867
- Funny teeth.
- Rinse.

1437
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:43,075
Why did you say...

1438
01:12:43,442 --> 01:12:44,609
Why did you say funny teeth?

1439
01:12:44,610 --> 01:12:47,412
You said funny teeth,
funny Rain Man.

1440
01:12:47,697 --> 01:12:49,781
Rain Man? I said Rain Man?

1441
01:12:49,782 --> 01:12:52,084
Yeah, funny Rain Man.

1442
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:57,747
Was I trying to say Raymond,
and it came out Rain Man?

1443
01:12:57,748 --> 01:13:00,346
Yeah, funny Rain Man.

1444
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:04,638
You? You're the Rain Man?

1445
01:13:18,311 --> 01:13:20,186
Who took this picture?

1446
01:13:20,187 --> 01:13:22,159
D-A-D.

1447
01:13:22,565 --> 01:13:23,815
And you lived with us?

1448
01:13:23,816 --> 01:13:28,086
10961 Beechcrest Street,
Cincinnati, Ohio.

1449
01:13:28,154 --> 01:13:30,739
When... When did you leave?

1450
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:33,383
January 21, 1965.

1451
01:13:33,659 --> 01:13:35,035
- You remember that?
- It was Thursday.

1452
01:13:35,036 --> 01:13:36,369
Very snowy out.

1453
01:13:36,370 --> 01:13:40,219
7.2 inches of snow that day.

1454
01:13:40,958 --> 01:13:42,792
That's just after mom
died, New Year's.

1455
01:13:42,793 --> 01:13:45,921
Mom died January 5, 1965.

1456
01:13:45,922 --> 01:13:48,048
And you remember that day? You
remember that day that you left?

1457
01:13:48,049 --> 01:13:49,633
After short and sudden illness.

1458
01:13:49,634 --> 01:13:52,636
- You remember that day you left?
- Yeah.

1459
01:13:52,637 --> 01:13:54,846
Was I there? Where was I?

1460
01:13:54,847 --> 01:13:57,015
You were in the window.

1461
01:13:57,016 --> 01:13:58,850
You waved to me.
"Bye-bye, Rain Man."

1462
01:13:58,851 --> 01:14:01,653
"Bye-bye, Rain Man."

1463
01:14:03,022 --> 01:14:06,399
So you were the one
that sang to me?

1464
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:08,452
Yeah.

1465
01:14:08,903 --> 01:14:12,447
What did you sing?

1466
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:15,000
What was that song?

1467
01:14:15,076 --> 01:14:17,173
What did you sing?

1468
01:14:18,204 --> 01:14:21,831
<i>Well, she was just 17</i>

1469
01:14:21,832 --> 01:14:25,168
<i>And you know what I mean</i>

1470
01:14:25,169 --> 01:14:30,600
<i>And the way she looked
was way beyond compare</i>

1471
01:14:30,925 --> 01:14:36,638
<i>So how could I dance with another</i>

1472
01:14:36,639 --> 01:14:43,196
<i>When I saw her standing there?</i>

1473
01:14:47,858 --> 01:14:50,235
Did I like it when you sang to me?

1474
01:14:50,236 --> 01:14:52,162
Yeah.

1475
01:14:52,405 --> 01:14:55,907
Did we sing any other songs?
You like The Beatles?

1476
01:14:55,908 --> 01:14:57,033
Yeah.

1477
01:14:59,912 --> 01:15:02,455
Scary! Scary bad!

1478
01:15:02,456 --> 01:15:04,290
Scary bad!

1479
01:15:04,291 --> 01:15:05,709
It's scary!

1480
01:15:09,338 --> 01:15:11,339
- Scary bad!
- What's scary bad?

1481
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:13,008
What's scary bad?

1482
01:15:13,009 --> 01:15:15,277
Hot water burn baby!

1483
01:15:15,302 --> 01:15:16,511
Water!

1484
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:17,929
"Hot water burn baby"?

1485
01:15:17,930 --> 01:15:21,099
- What baby? Me? Me?
- Yeah.

1486
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:22,851
Easy. Easy. Ray, Ray.

1487
01:15:22,852 --> 01:15:25,145
Hot water burn baby.

1488
01:15:25,146 --> 01:15:27,480
I'm not burned. Look at me. Please.

1489
01:15:27,481 --> 01:15:28,690
- Hot water burn baby!
- Ray, please. Please!

1490
01:15:28,691 --> 01:15:30,608
Please! I'm not burned.

1491
01:15:30,609 --> 01:15:32,652
- I'm not burned.
- Tub burn baby.

1492
01:15:32,653 --> 01:15:35,155
- I'm not burned, man.
- Tub burn baby.

1493
01:15:35,156 --> 01:15:37,503
- I'm not burned.
- Yeah.

1494
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:41,423
I'm not burned. It's okay.

1495
01:15:41,454 --> 01:15:43,631
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1496
01:15:45,416 --> 01:15:47,388
It's okay.

1497
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:54,883
Gotta go to Wallbrook now.

1498
01:15:54,884 --> 01:15:57,231
That's why they put you away.

1499
01:15:57,511 --> 01:15:59,779
They thought you'd hurt me.

1500
01:16:08,147 --> 01:16:10,982
Never hurt Charlie Babbitt.

1501
01:16:10,983 --> 01:16:12,650
What?

1502
01:16:12,651 --> 01:16:15,169
Never hurt Charlie Babbitt.

1503
01:16:15,946 --> 01:16:17,155
What, Ray?

1504
01:16:17,156 --> 01:16:19,708
Never hurt Charlie Babbitt.

1505
01:16:20,868 --> 01:16:22,794
What?

1506
01:16:26,916 --> 01:16:29,000
Come on, it's 11:00, Ray.

1507
01:16:29,001 --> 01:16:31,178
- Lights out.
- Yeah.

1508
01:16:39,970 --> 01:16:42,180
Never hurt Charlie Babbitt.

1509
01:16:42,181 --> 01:16:44,654
Never, never hurt Charlie Babbitt.

1510
01:16:51,357 --> 01:16:54,330
There you go. Right where you
like it, at the end of the bed.

1511
01:17:05,538 --> 01:17:07,681
Come on, Ray.

1512
01:17:54,795 --> 01:17:57,005
<i>Hi, it's me.</i>

1513
01:17:57,006 --> 01:18:00,091
Well, you didn't hang up.
Does that mean we're engaged?

1514
01:18:00,092 --> 01:18:02,109
Listen, I...

1515
01:18:04,096 --> 01:18:07,365
I just wanna hear
it's not over. I mean...

1516
01:18:08,058 --> 01:18:10,185
I'm scared it's over.

1517
01:18:10,186 --> 01:18:11,978
<i>Don't ask me tonight, Charlie.</i>

1518
01:18:11,979 --> 01:18:14,355
<i>I don't know what
to say. Let it sit.</i>

1519
01:18:14,356 --> 01:18:16,941
That's something I'm
not real good at.

1520
01:18:16,942 --> 01:18:19,777
<i>There's a lot of things
you're not good at.</i>

1521
01:18:19,778 --> 01:18:21,613
I'll call you when
I get back, okay?

1522
01:18:21,614 --> 01:18:23,586
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

1523
01:18:25,492 --> 01:18:26,743
I'll see you.

1524
01:18:26,744 --> 01:18:28,636
<i>Ciao.</i>

1525
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:55,999
What are you looking
at that for, Ray?

1526
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,875
I just spent a couple of hundred
dollars on a little TV,

1527
01:19:57,876 --> 01:19:59,294
and now you're watching a dryer.

1528
01:19:59,295 --> 01:20:01,045
I don't know.

1529
01:20:01,046 --> 01:20:03,506
'Cause believe me, Ray, at the shrink
hearing, we're gonna have to prove

1530
01:20:03,507 --> 01:20:05,049
you prefer to watch this little TV,

1531
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:06,426
as opposed to the clothes dryer.

1532
01:20:06,427 --> 01:20:07,760
- You understand that?
- Yeah.

1533
01:20:07,761 --> 01:20:10,179
- You listening to me?
- Yeah.

1534
01:20:10,180 --> 01:20:12,348
Turn this off, will you,
when you're not watching it?

1535
01:20:12,349 --> 01:20:13,433
Yeah.

1536
01:20:13,434 --> 01:20:17,103
If you run down the batteries, then where
are you gonna be at 3:00 when Wapner's on?

1537
01:20:17,104 --> 01:20:19,731
Yeah, the red one
always falls the same.

1538
01:20:19,732 --> 01:20:21,941
Why aren't you listening to me?

1539
01:20:21,942 --> 01:20:23,484
You just don't want to
listen to me, do you?

1540
01:20:23,485 --> 01:20:26,446
You want to go back to
Wallbrook, is that it?

1541
01:20:26,447 --> 01:20:28,544
I gotta make a phone call.

1542
01:20:39,126 --> 01:20:40,376
Yeah, Lenny, it's me, listen...

1543
01:20:40,377 --> 01:20:41,586
<i>Charlie, where have you been?</i>

1544
01:20:41,587 --> 01:20:43,421
<i>I've been sitting by this
phone for three hours, man.</i>

1545
01:20:43,422 --> 01:20:45,548
I had some things to do. I had
to buy some clothes and stuff.

1546
01:20:45,549 --> 01:20:48,968
<i>Clothes? Charlie, we are in
serious trouble. Serious trouble!</i>

1547
01:20:48,969 --> 01:20:50,136
<i>What are you doing buying clothes?</i>

1548
01:20:50,137 --> 01:20:52,347
Just take it easy. Take it easy.

1549
01:20:52,348 --> 01:20:54,057
I'm in Tucumcari.
I'll be there in a few...

1550
01:20:54,058 --> 01:20:55,892
<i>They repossessed the cars
to pay off the loan.</i>

1551

<i>The cars are gone,
Charlie. Gone.</i>

1552
01:20:58,937 --> 01:21:01,522
<i>Bateman wants his down
payment back. They all do.</i>

1553
01:21:01,523 --> 01:21:03,950
<i>That's 80 thou, Charlie.</i>

1554
01:21:04,193 --> 01:21:06,235
$80,000.

1555
01:21:06,236 --> 01:21:07,612
I don't have it.

1556
01:21:07,613 --> 01:21:10,615
<i>Look, you gotta pay these
people back, or it's all over,</i>

1557
01:21:10,616 --> 01:21:12,533
<i>we're out of business.</i>

1558
01:21:12,534 --> 01:21:13,951
<i>What am I gonna tell them?</i>

1559
01:21:13,952 --> 01:21:15,924
I don't know.

1560
01:21:32,054 --> 01:21:34,764
Son of a bitch!

1561
01:21:34,765 --> 01:21:37,642
<i>Son of a bitch!</i>

<i>Waits a beautiful day</i>

1566
01:22:11,885 --> 01:22:14,720
This would be a lot easier, Ray,
if you just let me put the top up.

1567
01:22:14,721 --> 01:22:16,522
You wouldn't have to fry.

1568
01:22:16,890 --> 01:22:18,599
Put this lotion on you so
you don't burn. All right?

1569
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:20,401
- Oh. Oh.
- Ray.

1570
01:22:20,436 --> 01:22:22,353
Don't start with that. You
want me to put the top up?

1571
01:22:22,354 --> 01:22:23,479
I definitely like the top down.

1572
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:25,648
Yes, I know that. Now,
I don't want you to burn.

1573
01:22:25,649 --> 01:22:29,652
Yeah. Definitely like it
when the top's... Ow. Ooh.

1574
01:22:29,653 --> 01:22:32,321
It's all right. Just take
it easy. Take it easy.

1575
01:22:32,322 --> 01:22:33,948
- Oh, no.
- It's almost over.

1576
01:22:33,949 --> 01:22:36,284
Uh-huh. All right.
How does that feel?

1577
01:22:36,285 --> 01:22:38,086
Very slippery.

there just a bit, Tom.</i>

1592
01:23:22,456 --> 01:23:24,040
<i>Sort of double-pumped
it, didn't he?</i>

1598
01:24:11,463 --> 01:24:13,435
Can't.

1599

doesn't want to hit. Hit me.

1664
01:30:00,645 --> 01:30:02,521
- Definitely want a hit.
- Hitting 18.

1665
01:30:02,522 --> 01:30:03,647
He doesn't want to hit.

1666
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:05,745
- Hit me, hit me, hit me.
- No, don't!

1667
01:30:06,610 --> 01:30:07,860
You took my queen, Ray.

1668
01:30:07,861 --> 01:30:09,486
I've got a 10, I needed that queen.

1669
01:30:09,487 --> 01:30:10,779
I can't take your queen!

1670
01:30:10,780 --> 01:30:13,073
Sir, please don't touch the cards.

1671
01:30:13,074 --> 01:30:14,491
I need my own queen, Ray.

1672
01:30:14,492 --> 01:30:16,635
There's lots of them.

1673
01:30:16,745 --> 01:30:19,639
- There's lots of them?
- Lots and lots of them.

1674
01:30:19,748 --> 01:30:22,676
Hold on here for a second.

1675
01:30:25,545 --> 01:30:27,517
I'm gonna double down.

1676
01:30:28,048 --> 01:30:30,841
Queen, queen.

1677
01:30:30,842 --> 01:30:32,343
Yes!

1678
01:30:32,344 --> 01:30:35,738
Yes, sir. You gotta love this town.

1679
01:30:36,890 --> 01:30:38,942
I'm going for it, Nick.

1680
01:30:38,975 --> 01:30:40,309
It looks like it.

1681
01:30:40,310 --> 01:30:42,953
It certainly looks like it.

1682
01:30:58,036 --> 01:30:59,787
Wanna bet one chip
or two chips, Ray?

1683
01:30:59,788 --> 01:31:01,714
Bet two.

1684
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:03,932
Bet two.

1685
01:31:49,879 --> 01:31:51,588
What's your secret, guys?

1686
01:31:51,589 --> 01:31:53,090
We cheat.

1687
01:31:54,426 --> 01:31:58,821
This is Sam. Tape table 47.

1688
01:32:04,936 --> 01:32:06,270
About $85,000.

1689
01:32:06,271 --> 01:32:09,440
$85,000? Did you call
the Eye in the Sky?

1690
01:32:09,441 --> 01:32:10,524
Sam did.

1691
01:32:10,525 --> 01:32:11,859
Sam did? Okay, I'll
take over from here.

1692
01:32:11,860 --> 01:32:13,661
All right.

1693
01:32:19,534 --> 01:32:21,426
All right!

1694
01:32:21,953 --> 01:32:24,972
You're doing well.
I'm happy for you, sir.

1695
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:30,461
What do you see?

1696
01:32:30,462 --> 01:32:33,756
Well, he's not catching the hole
card and he's not past posting us.

1697
01:32:33,757 --> 01:32:36,133
I don't see him using a computer.

1698
01:32:36,134 --> 01:32:37,676
No, he's not, but
something's not right.

1699
01:32:37,677 --> 01:32:41,230
You know there's no one in the world
can count into a six-deck shoe.

1700
01:33:14,506 --> 01:33:16,933
Hold it. Hold it here.

1701
01:33:18,093 --> 01:33:19,843
Watch my chips. I'm
gonna be back in second.

1702
01:33:19,844 --> 01:33:21,861
Go right ahead, sir.

1703
01:33:23,890 --> 01:33:26,225
Ray, what are you doing?
We're in the middle of a hand.

1704
01:33:26,226 --> 01:33:28,268
You don't leave in the middle
of a hand. Ray, Ray, Ray!

1705
01:33:28,269 --> 01:33:31,522
We're hot. We are red hot! The Babbitt
brothers, kickin' ass in Vegas!

1706
01:33:31,523 --> 01:33:33,132
<i>- Wheel of Fortune.</i>
- We got Cleopatra...

1707
01:33:33,133 --> 01:33:35,295
and Caesar over there waiting
for you. Come on, Ray.

1708
01:33:35,296 --> 01:33:37,361
"Look at all this
glamorous merchandise."

1709
01:33:37,362 --> 01:33:39,196
- One for bad, two for good.
- 20.

1710
01:33:39,197 --> 01:33:41,031
20? Yeah.

1711
01:33:41,032 --> 01:33:42,199
It's going to hit on 20?

1712
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:44,409
Yeah, 20, definitely 20.

1713
01:33:44,410 --> 01:33:47,258
$3,000 On 20.

1714
01:33:48,456 --> 01:33:49,623
Definitely 20.

1715
01:33:49,624 --> 01:33:51,676
- Definitely 20?
- Yeah.

1716
01:33:58,091 --> 01:34:00,017
Uh-oh.

1717
01:34:02,011 --> 01:34:03,679
- It's not your game, Ray.
- Yeah.

1718
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:05,764
- I just lost $3,000.
- Yeah.

1719
01:34:05,765 --> 01:34:07,266
That's $3,000 I lost.

1720
01:34:07,267 --> 01:34:09,393
Come on, Ray, come on, a little...

1721
01:34:09,394 --> 01:34:13,313
No? Easy, don't start
banging yourself, all right?

1722
01:34:13,314 --> 01:34:15,941
- Maybe we'll play a little bit later.
- Yeah.

1723
01:34:15,942 --> 01:34:18,540
- I'm gonna cash in.
- Yeah, cash in.

1724
01:34:18,611 --> 01:34:20,708
You make me sad, Ray.

1725
01:34:22,198 --> 01:34:24,045
20.

1726
01:34:26,202 --> 01:34:29,204
We won $86,000 and some
change, right, Ray?

1727
01:34:29,205 --> 01:34:30,581
$86,500.

1728
01:34:30,582 --> 01:34:32,599
$80,000.

1729
01:34:32,667 --> 01:34:34,751
Refund on the car payments,

1730
01:34:34,752 --> 01:34:36,003
and I owe...

1731
01:34:36,004 --> 01:34:38,630
What did I say I owe
to get the Rolex back?

1732
01:34:38,631 --> 01:34:39,756
$3,500.

1733
01:34:39,757 --> 01:34:41,091
Six months to pay.

1734
01:34:41,092 --> 01:34:44,678
$3,500. We don't have to pay
for the room, that's comped.

1735
01:34:44,679 --> 01:34:47,652
I'm free and clear. I'm gonna
go take a celebration piss.

1736
01:34:50,101 --> 01:34:53,645
Don't go anywhere. Until I get
back, the sign says "Don't walk."

1737
01:34:53,646 --> 01:34:56,289
- Don't walk.
- Don't walk.

1738
01:35:14,709 --> 01:35:16,510
Hey.

1739
01:35:17,212 --> 01:35:19,338
You looking for a date?

1740
01:35:19,339 --> 01:35:21,381
- Are you?
- I don't know.

1741
01:35:21,382 --> 01:35:23,300
- What's your name?
- Raymond.

1742
01:35:23,301 --> 01:35:25,318
My name is Iris.

1743
01:35:25,762 --> 01:35:27,471
Raymond, you like me?

1744
01:35:27,472 --> 01:35:29,139
I don't know.

1745
01:35:29,140 --> 01:35:30,974
You don't know?

1746
01:35:30,975 --> 01:35:32,768
I think if you gave me
a chance, you would.

1747
01:35:32,769 --> 01:35:34,937
Why don't we try to get
to know each other?

1748
01:35:34,938 --> 01:35:36,355
Yeah, get to know each other.

1749
01:35:36,356 --> 01:35:38,783
He doesn't have any money, honey.

1750
01:35:39,817 --> 01:35:42,486
That's all right, sugar,
'cause we are just talking.

1751
01:35:42,487 --> 01:35:44,789
Yeah, we're just talking.

1752
01:35:45,740 --> 01:35:47,491
Let's go upstairs, Ray.
What are you doing, man?

1753
01:35:47,492 --> 01:35:49,326
Getting to know each other.

1754
01:35:49,327 --> 01:35:51,495
- Just talking.
- What room? I'll bring him up.

1755
01:35:51,496 --> 01:35:53,593
That's all right.

1756
01:35:54,290 --> 01:35:55,374
Is that what you want to do?

1757
01:35:55,375 --> 01:35:56,833
You want to stay here and get
to know each other, Ray?

1758
01:35:56,834 --> 01:36:00,254
Yeah. Get to know
each other. Just talking.

1759
01:36:00,255 --> 01:36:01,672
- This will be interesting.
- Yeah.

1760
01:36:01,673 --> 01:36:04,646
- I'll be over here just in case.
- Yeah.

1761
01:36:05,176 --> 01:36:06,885
He doesn't seem to
like me. Who is he?

1762
01:36:06,886 --> 01:36:09,179
He's my brother.
I'm living in his room.

1763
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:10,722
He seems young to be your brother.

1764
01:36:10,723 --> 01:36:13,558
He was born August 12, 1962.

1765
01:36:13,559 --> 01:36:15,576
It was a Sunday.

1766
01:36:17,188 --> 01:36:19,831
What exactly do you guys do here?

1767
01:36:19,899 --> 01:36:21,692
We're counting cards.

1768
01:36:21,693 --> 01:36:23,527
You're counting cards?

1769
01:36:23,528 --> 01:36:25,529
We're counting cards.

1770
01:36:25,530 --> 01:36:27,864
- Uh-huh.
- We're counting cards.

1771
01:36:27,865 --> 01:36:30,008
What else do you do?

1772
01:36:30,201 --> 01:36:31,952
We're counting cards.

1773
01:36:31,953 --> 01:36:34,162
I know that you're counting cards.
What else do you do?

1774
01:36:34,163 --> 01:36:36,790
Are you taking any
prescription medication?

1775
01:36:36,791 --> 01:36:39,844
Whoa. Look, I'm out of here.

1776
01:36:40,545 --> 01:36:42,045
Course, what time is the date?

1777
01:36:42,046 --> 01:36:44,047
- Later.
- What time is the date?

1778
01:36:44,048 --> 01:36:46,080
- It's 10:00!
- Course, I have to be in bed at 11:00.

1779
01:36:46,081 --> 01:36:50,696
Lights out at 11:00. 10:00
daylight-saving time.

1780
01:36:50,722 --> 01:36:53,974
- 10:00 daylight-saving time.
- 10:00?

1781
01:36:53,975 --> 01:36:55,392
You like her, Ray?
You think she's pretty?

1782
01:36:55,393 --> 01:36:57,394
Yeah. She's very sparkly.

1783
01:36:57,395 --> 01:37:01,039
- Definitely very sparkly.
- Very sparkly.

1784
01:37:03,234 --> 01:37:04,735
He did a great job on that suit.

1785
01:37:04,736 --> 01:37:06,862
You don't realize
how good you look.

1786
01:37:06,863 --> 01:37:09,336
- Do you like it?
- It's not Kmart.

1787
01:37:09,365 --> 01:37:10,782
How could you not like that suit?

1788
01:37:10,783 --> 01:37:12,617
You look fantastic, Ray.

1789
01:37:12,618 --> 01:37:14,911
- How can you not like that suit?
- It's not a Kmart suit.

1790
01:37:14,912 --> 01:37:16,705
- I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.
- Yeah.

1791
01:37:16,706 --> 01:37:20,055
- Kmart sucks. Okay?
- Yeah.

1792
01:37:22,754 --> 01:37:24,546
- There you go, Ray.
- Yeah.

1793
01:37:24,547 --> 01:37:26,423
It's the high rollers' suite.

1794
01:37:26,424 --> 01:37:28,396
This is for you.

1795
01:37:28,551 --> 01:37:31,053
Ever seen a room like this before?

1796
01:37:31,054 --> 01:37:32,679
What's up there?

1797
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:33,805
What's up there?

1798
01:37:33,806 --> 01:37:35,474
You're not even looking, man.

1799
01:37:35,475 --> 01:37:36,600
Yeah. Bed.

1800
01:37:36,601 --> 01:37:37,976
That's a bed. That's your bed.

1801
01:37:37,977 --> 01:37:39,353
I had them put it up there
especially for you,

1802
01:37:39,354 --> 01:37:40,687
right by the window, just
the way you like it.

1803
01:37:40,688 --> 01:37:43,490
- Bed by the window.
- That's right. Go on up.

1804
01:37:44,108 --> 01:37:46,876
- Just the way you like it, isn't it?
- Yeah.

1805
01:37:48,196 --> 01:37:50,447
Look at you with all
those lights, Ray.

1806
01:37:50,448 --> 01:37:53,950
Mr. Vegas. You are
Mr. Las Vegas now, man.

1807
01:37:53,951 --> 01:37:55,243
What do you think?

1808
01:37:55,244 --> 01:37:58,923
There's a lot of lights out there.
Very sparkly. Very twinkly.

1809
01:37:59,248 --> 01:38:00,749
We made a lot of money today.

1810
01:38:00,750 --> 01:38:02,793
We made a lot of money!

1811
01:38:02,794 --> 01:38:06,963
Forgetting the $3,000 that we tossed
away at that wheel of fortune.

1812
01:38:06,964 --> 01:38:09,257
Yeah, wheel of fortune.

1813
01:38:09,258 --> 01:38:10,634
I'm sorry about that.

1814
01:38:10,635 --> 01:38:12,886
I'm sorry, you know, I got
a little carried away.

1815
01:38:12,887 --> 01:38:16,315
- I got a little hot, okay, Ray?
- Yeah.

1816
01:38:17,266 --> 01:38:21,195
I'm saying that I'm sorry, and I just
want you to know that I am sorry.

1817
01:38:22,522 --> 01:38:24,314
I'm apologizing.

1818
01:38:24,315 --> 01:38:26,149
I got a little carried away.

1819
01:38:26,150 --> 01:38:30,124
The money... I got a little greedy.

1820
01:38:30,238 --> 01:38:31,321
Want to say something?

1821
01:38:31,322 --> 01:38:33,824
I have to be at the bar
at 10:00 with Iris.

1822
01:38:33,825 --> 01:38:35,659
I mean, 'cause, you know,
I've got to thank you, man.

1823
01:38:35,660 --> 01:38:37,632
You...

1824
01:38:38,329 --> 01:38:39,996
You did it. You did it.

1825
01:38:39,997 --> 01:38:41,915
I was just there.

1826
01:38:41,916 --> 01:38:43,500
You saved my ass.

1827
01:38:43,501 --> 01:38:46,211
I was just along for the ride.

1828
01:38:46,212 --> 01:38:48,755
Have to be at the bar at 10:00.

1829
01:38:48,756 --> 01:38:50,132
Have to go to the date with Iris.

1830
01:38:50,133 --> 01:38:52,175
Yeah, Iris. That's her name.

1831
01:38:52,176 --> 01:38:53,677
Big date. Going to go dancing.

1832
01:38:53,678 --> 01:38:55,011
Yeah, dancing.

1833
01:38:55,012 --> 01:38:57,097
Have to go to the date with
Iris at the bar, dancing.

1834
01:38:57,098 --> 01:38:58,807
Know how to dance?

1835
01:38:58,808 --> 01:38:59,975
I don't know.

1836
01:38:59,976 --> 01:39:01,893
You don't know how to dance?
You ought to learn sometime.

1837
01:39:01,894 --> 01:39:07,315
Have to learn to dance with a date.

1838
01:39:07,316 --> 01:39:10,527
I was just kidding, Ray. You're not
gonna have to dance on this date.

1839
01:39:10,528 --> 01:39:12,237
Have to go to the date.
Learn to dance.

1840
01:39:12,238 --> 01:39:14,489
Definitely. Now.

1841
01:39:14,490 --> 01:39:15,866
Ray, you don't have to dance now,

1842
01:39:15,867 --> 01:39:17,409
but, listen, I'll teach you
how to dance sometime.

1843
01:39:17,410 --> 01:39:18,660
Definitely have to.

1844
01:39:18,661 --> 01:39:20,370
No, you're not gonna
have to dance on this.

1845
01:39:20,371 --> 01:39:22,581
Definitely have to learn
to dance now for the date.

1846
01:39:22,582 --> 01:39:24,541
Sorry I even brought
this up. All right, Ray.

1847
01:39:24,542 --> 01:39:27,043
- You're right. My mistake.
- 10:00.

1848
01:39:27,044 --> 01:39:30,172
You got the only famous
dancing hooker in Vegas.

1849
01:39:30,173 --> 01:39:32,020
All right. Stand over there.

1850
01:39:37,722 --> 01:39:39,764
<i>My lonely days are over</i>

1851
01:39:39,765 --> 01:39:41,817
- Come over here.
- Yeah.

1852
01:39:43,144 --> 01:39:45,020
- Now, you hear the music?
- Yeah.

1853
01:39:45,021 --> 01:39:46,563
Just watch my feet.

1854
01:39:46,564 --> 01:39:48,741
Raymond, watch my feet.

1855
01:39:49,025 --> 01:39:51,293
- Yeah.
- Just do what I'm doing.

1856
01:39:51,652 --> 01:39:54,029
Okay, you see? You feel
the rhythm of the music?

1857
01:39:54,030 --> 01:39:56,364
We're just moving
our feet like that.

1858
01:39:56,365 --> 01:39:59,659
Okay? Now, you're the guy,
so you're gonna have to lead.

1859
01:39:59,660 --> 01:40:01,703
All right, and I'm the
date, so you want to...

1860
01:40:01,704 --> 01:40:04,247
<i>The skies above are blue</i>

1861
01:40:04,248 --> 01:40:05,957
You want to...

1862
01:40:05,958 --> 01:40:07,667
Put your left hand up like this.

1863
01:40:07,668 --> 01:40:08,752
Raymond, don't stop moving.

1864
01:40:08,753 --> 01:40:10,420
- Raymond, paying attention?
- Yeah.

1865
01:40:10,421 --> 01:40:13,048
Don't stop moving. Put
your left hand up like this.

1866
01:40:13,049 --> 01:40:15,133
- Yeah.
- Left hand up. That's good.

1867
01:40:15,134 --> 01:40:17,511
Don't stop moving.
Just keep moving.

1868
01:40:17,512 --> 01:40:18,762
That's good. Just like that.

1869
01:40:18,763 --> 01:40:22,265
Now you wanna take this other hand, you
wanna put it around behind my back.

1870
01:40:22,266 --> 01:40:24,142
- Want to learn how to dance?
- Yeah.

1871
01:40:24,143 --> 01:40:26,061
Okay, 'cause you gotta touch
someone when you dance.

1872
01:40:26,062 --> 01:40:28,772
- I'm not going to hurt you, all right?
- Yeah.

1873
01:40:28,773 --> 01:40:30,857
Just put it right there.

1874
01:40:30,858 --> 01:40:33,443
I take my hand, I put it up here.

1875
01:40:33,444 --> 01:40:34,736
Watch my feet, Ray.

1876
01:40:34,737 --> 01:40:37,631
Watch my feet. The
rhythm, the rhythm.

1877
01:40:37,949 --> 01:40:39,741
All right?

1878
01:40:39,742 --> 01:40:41,660
Now, when you dance you can't
watch my feet the whole time,

1879
01:40:41,661 --> 01:40:43,954
- so you're gonna have to look up.
- Yeah.

1880
01:40:43,955 --> 01:40:48,667
When I tell you to, I want you
to just look up, real slow.

1881
01:40:48,668 --> 01:40:50,585
Just keep moving.

1882
01:40:50,586 --> 01:40:52,170
- Okay, you ready?
- Yeah.

1883
01:40:52,171 --> 01:40:54,268
- All right, start looking up.
- Yeah.

1884
01:40:54,632 --> 01:40:57,133
A little more. Keep moving.

1885
01:40:57,134 --> 01:40:59,481
- Just a little more.
- Yeah.

1886
01:40:59,720 --> 01:41:01,846
A little more, Ray.

1887
01:41:01,847 --> 01:41:03,348
All the way up.

1888
01:41:03,349 --> 01:41:05,934
<i>You smile</i>

1889
01:41:05,935 --> 01:41:07,686
- There you go, Ray.
- Yeah.

1890
01:41:07,687 --> 01:41:08,979
You're dancing. This is it.

1891
01:41:08,980 --> 01:41:10,480
Yeah, dancing.

1892
01:41:10,481 --> 01:41:13,149
You want to close your
hand here. Just...

1893
01:41:13,150 --> 01:41:15,151
You wanna pull like that.

1894
01:41:15,152 --> 01:41:17,237
You're gonna turn
me like this, okay?

1895
01:41:17,238 --> 01:41:18,947
<i>Here we are in heaven</i>

1896
01:41:18,948 --> 01:41:20,865
Just turn. That's good.

1897
01:41:20,866 --> 01:41:23,493
- This is dancing.
- This is dancing.

1898
01:41:23,494 --> 01:41:25,412
Don't know about you, but I'm
starting to feel a little silly.

1899
01:41:25,413 --> 01:41:28,790
<i>For you are mine</i>

1900
01:41:28,791 --> 01:41:33,437
<i>At last</i>

1901
01:42:00,197 --> 01:42:01,615
- That's it.
- Yeah.

1902
01:42:01,616 --> 01:42:04,159
All right! All right!

1903
01:42:04,160 --> 01:42:06,202
- Beautiful! You are a good dancer!
- Yeah.

1904
01:42:06,203 --> 01:42:07,495
- You wanna give me a hug?
- Yeah.

1905
01:42:07,496 --> 01:42:08,788
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1906
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:24,109
I just wanted to
give you a hug, Ray.

1907
01:42:25,973 --> 01:42:28,525
Just felt like giving you a hug.

1908
01:42:43,991 --> 01:42:45,617
What are you doing here?

1909
01:42:45,618 --> 01:42:47,243
I'm unemployed.

1910
01:42:47,244 --> 01:42:48,286
What do you mean?

1911
01:42:48,287 --> 01:42:50,372
- You don't know about the business?
- I know about the business.

1912
01:42:50,373 --> 01:42:53,050
Come on in. It's okay.

1913
01:42:54,794 --> 01:42:57,847
I'm glad to see you.

1914
01:42:58,047 --> 01:42:59,798
Ray, look who's here.

1915
01:43:24,949 --> 01:43:27,784
It's not right, what
you're doing to Raymond.

1916
01:43:27,785 --> 01:43:29,119
He's fine.

1917
01:43:29,120 --> 01:43:34,165
I know he's fine. He's in Las
Vegas in a suit, in a big room.

1918
01:43:34,166 --> 01:43:35,875
It makes me sad.

1919
01:43:35,876 --> 01:43:37,377
Six minutes to my date.

1920
01:43:37,378 --> 01:43:39,555
Six minutes to Iris.

1921
01:43:40,131 --> 01:43:42,353
He has a date?

1922
01:43:43,134 --> 01:43:44,217
Raymond, it'd be nice

1923
01:43:44,218 --> 01:43:47,387
if you didn't carry that
television everywhere we go.

1924
01:43:47,388 --> 01:43:49,848
What do you gotta bring a
Watchman for on your date?

1925
01:43:49,849 --> 01:43:51,808
The man's dancing.

1926
01:43:51,809 --> 01:43:55,112
But what does your date
look like, Raymond?

1927
01:43:55,312 --> 01:43:56,479
She's very sparkly.

1928
01:43:56,480 --> 01:43:58,748
She looks like a holiday.

1929
01:44:00,359 --> 01:44:01,693
I don't think I've
heard that one before.

1930
01:44:01,694 --> 01:44:02,986
Mr. Babbitt.

1931
01:44:02,987 --> 01:44:05,572
Mr. Kelso would like to see you.

1932
01:44:05,573 --> 01:44:08,283
- I don't know Mr. Kelso.
- He's director of security.

1933
01:44:08,284 --> 01:44:09,993
Would you come with me, please?

1934
01:44:09,994 --> 01:44:12,328
Sure. Listen, Susanna, why
don't you stay with Raymond?

1935
01:44:12,329 --> 01:44:13,830
Right this way, sir.

1936
01:44:30,181 --> 01:44:32,056
10:01. She's not here.

1937
01:44:32,057 --> 01:44:34,951
She'll come. She will.

1938
01:44:43,736 --> 01:44:45,361
Congratulations, Mr. Babbitt.

1939
01:44:45,362 --> 01:44:48,031
Counting into a six-deck
shoe is quite a feat.

1940
01:44:48,032 --> 01:44:50,658
I'm afraid I don't understand
what you're talking about.

1941
01:44:50,659 --> 01:44:52,994
We make videotapes, Mr. Babbitt,

1942
01:44:52,995 --> 01:44:54,621
and we analyze the tapes,

1943
01:44:54,622 --> 01:44:57,373
and we even share some of the
information with the other casinos.

1944
01:44:57,374 --> 01:44:59,751
These tapes suggest that you
should take your winnings

1945
01:44:59,752 --> 01:45:01,377
and leave the state.

1946
01:45:01,378 --> 01:45:03,463
Mr. Kelso, someone has
a good day at the tables

1947
01:45:03,464 --> 01:45:06,466
and you accuse them of
illegal activities?

1948
01:45:06,467 --> 01:45:08,551
Is this how you treat
all your guests?

1949
01:45:08,552 --> 01:45:11,054
All you have to do is close
your mouth and go home.

1950
01:45:11,055 --> 01:45:14,182
And those are the best odds
you're gonna see for a while.

1951
01:45:14,183 --> 01:45:16,030
I'd take 'em.

1952
01:45:24,902 --> 01:45:26,637
Did you want to dance
on your date, Ray?

1953
01:45:26,638 --> 01:45:29,798
- Yeah.
- There'll be other chances, Ray.

1954
01:45:29,824 --> 01:45:32,126
Many pretty girls would
love to dance with you.

1955
01:45:32,127 --> 01:45:33,176
Yeah.

1956
01:45:33,202 --> 01:45:35,219
- It's gonna be okay.
- Yeah.

1957
01:45:51,428 --> 01:45:52,762
Uh-oh.

1958
01:45:52,763 --> 01:45:54,264
I like this music, Ray.

1959
01:45:54,265 --> 01:45:55,348
Elevator stopped.

1960
01:45:55,349 --> 01:45:56,766
It's okay.

1961
01:45:56,767 --> 01:45:59,769
You think you could show me the way
you were going to dance with Iris?

1962
01:45:59,770 --> 01:46:01,771
- Yeah.
- Yes?

1963
01:46:01,772 --> 01:46:03,481
Would you like to dance with me?

1964
01:46:03,482 --> 01:46:05,108
Elevator's on hold.

1965
01:46:05,109 --> 01:46:07,411
- It's okay. Give me this.
- Yeah.

1966
01:46:11,115 --> 01:46:12,574
Show me. Show me how.

1967
01:46:12,575 --> 01:46:14,742
Yeah. Charlie Babbitt taught me.

1968
01:46:14,743 --> 01:46:17,090
- Charlie Babbitt?
- Yeah.

1969
01:46:18,205 --> 01:46:20,598
Dancing in the elevator.

1970
01:46:21,250 --> 01:46:23,222
It's nice.

1971
01:46:25,588 --> 01:46:28,015
You're very good.

1972
01:46:40,603 --> 01:46:43,104
Iris missed a beautiful dance.

1973
01:46:43,105 --> 01:46:45,031
Yeah.

1974
01:46:45,482 --> 01:46:48,284
- And a kiss.
- Yeah, and a kiss.

1975
01:46:48,402 --> 01:46:49,485
Have you ever kissed a girl?

1976
01:46:49,486 --> 01:46:51,538
I don't know.

1977
01:46:52,615 --> 01:46:54,712
You don't know?

1978
01:46:56,201 --> 01:46:59,003
Open your mouth. Open.

1979
01:47:00,664 --> 01:47:01,831
Like this.

1980
01:47:01,832 --> 01:47:05,543
Like you are tasting
something very good

1981
01:47:05,544 --> 01:47:07,846
and very soft.

1982
01:47:11,175 --> 01:47:12,508
Like this.

1983
01:47:12,509 --> 01:47:14,606
Close your eyes.

1984
01:47:21,226 --> 01:47:23,573
- It's okay, Ray.
- Yeah.

1985
01:47:31,904 --> 01:47:33,404
How was that?

1986
01:47:33,405 --> 01:47:35,422
Wet.

1987
01:47:36,241 --> 01:47:37,367
Then we did it right.

1988
01:47:37,368 --> 01:47:39,369
Elevator's definitely stuck.

1989
01:47:39,370 --> 01:47:41,672
No, it's not stuck.

1990
01:47:49,046 --> 01:47:51,564
Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers.

1991
01:47:52,716 --> 01:47:55,359
- Like us.
- Yeah, like us.

1992
01:47:55,719 --> 01:47:57,178
What did I tell you, Ray?

1993
01:47:57,179 --> 01:47:59,097
I promised you could
drive, this is it.

1994
01:47:59,098 --> 01:48:01,140
At Wallbrook, I drive
slow on the driveway.

1995
01:48:01,141 --> 01:48:03,059
Charlie, this is okay?
He can drive?

1996
01:48:03,060 --> 01:48:04,686
Course, I'm an excellent driver.

1997
01:48:04,687 --> 01:48:06,704
He's very good in the driveway.

1998
01:49:04,121 --> 01:49:06,719
Ray, why don't you get
in the front seat?

1999
01:49:08,208 --> 01:49:10,377
So I'll wait to hear from you
after Raymond's meeting?

2000
01:49:10,378 --> 01:49:11,658
- Yeah.
- Don't worry.

2001
01:49:11,661 --> 01:49:14,297
- It's gonna be fine, okay?
- Oh, yeah.

2002
01:49:14,298 --> 01:49:15,798
- I'm nervous.
- I know.

2003
01:49:15,799 --> 01:49:19,594
Listen, I'm glad... Happy. I'm
happy that you came to Vegas.

2004
01:49:19,595 --> 01:49:20,845
I know.

2005
01:49:23,182 --> 01:49:25,108
Ciao.

2006
01:49:26,101 --> 01:49:29,520
Ray, thank you for the
date in the elevator.

2007
01:49:29,521 --> 01:49:31,064
- It was really nice.
- Yeah.

2008
01:49:31,065 --> 01:49:32,190
- Ciao.
- Yeah.

2009
01:49:32,191 --> 01:49:33,441
Thank you for the what? What?

2010
01:49:33,442 --> 01:49:35,651
Nothing. Something between us.

2011
01:49:35,652 --> 01:49:38,329
- Between us?
- Mmm-hmm, us.

2012
01:49:41,325 --> 01:49:43,342
Us, Ray?

2013
01:49:49,083 --> 01:49:50,333
Here we go, Ray.

2014
01:49:50,334 --> 01:49:51,667
This is your bedroom up here.

2015
01:49:51,668 --> 01:49:54,295
Course, there's no bed there.
Definitely no bed there.

2016
01:49:54,296 --> 01:49:57,507
Oh, no, this is a magic bed, Ray.

2017
01:49:57,508 --> 01:49:59,300
You just watch and see.

2018
01:49:59,301 --> 01:50:02,595
We got the table over here.
We got the television, Ray.

2019
01:50:02,596 --> 01:50:05,515
Went to the video store, I got a
little surprise for you, Ray.

2020
01:50:05,516 --> 01:50:07,225
I picked up a video for you.

2021
01:50:08,435 --> 01:50:09,519
Don't start with that, Ray.

2022
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:11,062
This is...

2023
01:50:11,063 --> 01:50:12,480
It's not just another place, Ray.

2024
01:50:12,481 --> 01:50:15,329
This is... This is my place.

2025
01:50:15,776 --> 01:50:18,027
That's the man's name.
That's whose name? Yes.

2026
01:50:18,028 --> 01:50:20,530
Who? The first baseman.
Who's on first.

2027
01:50:20,531 --> 01:50:22,365
You got a first baseman?

2028
01:50:22,366 --> 01:50:24,450
Who's playing first? Absolutely.

2029
01:50:24,451 --> 01:50:26,619
<i>When you pay off the first
baseman, who gets the money?</i>

2030
01:50:26,620 --> 01:50:29,413
<i>Every dollar of it. Why not?</i>

2031
01:50:29,414 --> 01:50:30,706
<i>- The man's entitled to it.
- Who is?</i>

2032
01:50:30,707 --> 01:50:32,375
Yes.

2033
01:50:32,376 --> 01:50:34,293
<i>- So who gets it?
- Why shouldn't he?</i>

2034
01:50:34,294 --> 01:50:36,212
<i>Sometimes his wife comes
down and collects it.</i>

2035
01:50:36,213 --> 01:50:38,089
<i>- Whose wife?
- Yes.</i>

2036
01:50:39,383 --> 01:50:41,092
<i>- After all, the man earns it.
- Who does?</i>

2037
01:50:41,093 --> 01:50:42,802
<i>Absolutely.</i>

2038
01:50:42,803 --> 01:50:45,221
<i>All I'm tryin' to find out is what's
the guy's name on first base?</i>

2039
01:50:45,222 --> 01:50:47,890
<i>No. What is on second base.</i>

2040
01:50:47,891 --> 01:50:49,559
This is funny, Ray. Don't
you think this is funny?

2041
01:50:49,560 --> 01:50:51,519
Yeah, this is funny.

2042
01:50:51,520 --> 01:50:53,146
<i>I'm not changing nobody.</i>

2043
01:50:53,147 --> 01:50:54,355
Where'd you see this first?

2044
01:50:54,356 --> 01:50:56,399
Dad gave me a book
of baseball trivia.

2045
01:50:56,400 --> 01:50:58,651
- Dad, huh?
<i>- I'm not asking you who's on second.</i>

2046
01:50:58,652 --> 01:51:01,580
- Guess it didn't read as funny.
- Definitely not.

2047
01:51:01,613 --> 01:51:03,739
<i>We're not talking about him.</i>

2048
01:51:03,740 --> 01:51:05,575
<i>Hello, this is Dr. Bruner.</i>

2049
01:51:05,576 --> 01:51:07,577
<i>I'd like you to call me...</i>

2050
01:51:07,578 --> 01:51:08,995
Yeah, what is it?

2051
01:51:08,996 --> 01:51:10,872
<i>Oh, I thought I got the machine.</i>

2052
01:51:10,873 --> 01:51:12,081
No.

2053
01:51:12,082 --> 01:51:13,457
<i>I just got into town,
and, as you know,</i>

2054
01:51:13,458 --> 01:51:16,294
<i>the psychological interview
is tomorrow, Charlie.</i>

2055
01:51:16,295 --> 01:51:18,004
Yes, sir, I know that.

2056
01:51:18,005 --> 01:51:20,464
<i>I thought we should get
together and talk.</i>

2057
01:51:20,465 --> 01:51:23,134
<i>I really think it might be in
your best interest to meet me.</i>

2058
01:51:23,135 --> 01:51:24,260
All right.

2059
01:51:24,261 --> 01:51:25,428
When?

2060
01:51:25,429 --> 01:51:26,762
<i>I'm at the Bonaventure.</i>

2061
01:51:26,763 --> 01:51:28,347
<i>How about tonight at 8:30?</i>

2062
01:51:51,038 --> 01:51:53,875
Tomorrow morning you'll meet Dr.
Marston who's in charge of Raymond's

2063
01:51:53,876 --> 01:51:56,100
- psychiatric evaluation.
- Yeah, I know.

2064
01:51:56,126 --> 01:51:58,836
I gave him boxes of files
on Raymond. Boxes.

2065
01:51:58,837 --> 01:52:00,129
Well, good luck.

2066
01:52:00,130 --> 01:52:02,924
Look, this isn't a close
call, son. It's a formality.

2067
01:52:02,925 --> 01:52:04,800
Your brother's a very
disabled individual.

2068
01:52:04,801 --> 01:52:06,719
You trying to tell me that
Marston's gonna rule against me?

2069
01:52:06,720 --> 01:52:07,803
Is that why you called me up here?

2070
01:52:07,804 --> 01:52:10,473
No, I'm telling you it's always
been a lost cause, Charlie.

2071
01:52:10,474 --> 01:52:11,933
Then what is this about?
Why'd you call me?

2072
01:52:11,934 --> 01:52:15,019
Let me tell you something. Your father put
me in charge of all the money, all right?

2073
01:52:15,020 --> 01:52:16,145
Yeah.

2074
01:52:16,146 --> 01:52:19,106
And it doesn't matter whether or
not you win custody of Raymond.

2075
01:52:19,107 --> 01:52:20,816
I won't have to pay you a dime.

2076
01:52:20,817 --> 01:52:22,860
It's at my discretion,
not the court's.

2077
01:52:22,861 --> 01:52:24,195
What, so you can't lose?

2078
01:52:24,196 --> 01:52:25,488
I can lose.

2079
01:52:25,489 --> 01:52:26,822
I can lose Raymond.

2080
01:52:26,823 --> 01:52:29,825
I happen to care about your brother's
life and the treatment he receives.

2081
01:52:29,826 --> 01:52:31,869
I made a commitment to your
father some 20 years ago,

2082
01:52:31,870 --> 01:52:34,764
and I'm not willing
to gamble with that.

2083
01:52:36,124 --> 01:52:37,416
What is this?

2084
01:52:37,417 --> 01:52:39,639
It's a very big check.

2085
01:52:42,547 --> 01:52:44,590
$250,000.

2086
01:52:44,591 --> 01:52:46,342
And no strings attached.

2087
01:52:46,343 --> 01:52:48,565
You just walk away, Charlie.

2088
01:52:49,054 --> 01:52:51,472
You know, this isn't
about you and me.

2089
01:52:51,473 --> 01:52:53,866
It's not about winning or losing.

2090
01:52:55,978 --> 01:52:59,814
I asked you a week ago, why didn't
anyone ever tell me I had a brother?

2091
01:52:59,815 --> 01:53:01,832
You didn't have an answer.

2092
01:53:02,901 --> 01:53:04,827
I don't know.

2093
01:53:06,363 --> 01:53:07,697
It's funny, I just realized

2094
01:53:07,698 --> 01:53:11,342
I'm not pissed off anymore my
father cut me out of his will.

2095
01:53:12,703 --> 01:53:14,287
You were his friend, you
probably knew he tried

2096
01:53:14,288 --> 01:53:17,164
to contact me a few
times over the years.

2097
01:53:17,165 --> 01:53:19,125
I never called him back.
I was a prick.

2098
01:53:19,126 --> 01:53:21,043
If he was my son,
didn't return my calls,

2099
01:53:21,044 --> 01:53:22,878
I'd have written him out. Fuck him.

2100
01:53:22,879 --> 01:53:25,602
But it's not about
the money anymore.

2101
01:53:26,842 --> 01:53:30,094
It's about... I just
don't understand

2102
01:53:30,095 --> 01:53:31,762
why didn't he tell
me I had a brother?

2103
01:53:31,763 --> 01:53:33,055
Why didn't you tell
me I had a brother?

2104
01:53:33,056 --> 01:53:37,201
Why didn't anyone ever tell
me that I had a brother?

2105
01:53:38,228 --> 01:53:40,154
I mean...

2106
01:53:40,230 --> 01:53:45,035
Because it'd have been nice to know him
for more than just the past six days.

2107
01:55:09,194 --> 01:55:11,837
Ray! Ray! Ray! Ray!

2108
01:55:27,295 --> 01:55:29,171
Ray! Ray! Ray! Ray!

2109
01:55:29,172 --> 01:55:30,506
Ray!

2110
01:55:30,507 --> 01:55:31,966
Come on.

2111
01:55:31,967 --> 01:55:35,065
It stopped. It's all right.

2112
01:55:41,810 --> 01:55:43,811
V-E-R-N.

2113
01:55:43,812 --> 01:55:45,989
Vern. Vern.

2114
01:55:46,022 --> 01:55:48,916
Main man. My main man, Vern.

2115
01:55:49,734 --> 01:55:51,786
V-E-R-N.

2116
01:55:55,031 --> 01:55:56,832
Uh-oh.

2117
01:55:58,660 --> 01:56:01,133
My main man, Vern.

2118
01:56:03,290 --> 01:56:07,014
V-E-R-N. Vern. My main man.

2119
01:56:07,043 --> 01:56:09,211
All right, Ray, they got
raspberry, strawberry, blueberry,

2120
01:56:09,212 --> 01:56:11,380
Pink Caddie, whole-wheat,
Peachy Keen, beer nut,

2121
01:56:11,381 --> 01:56:14,341
Rocky Road, buckwheat,
Belly Buster, blueberry.

2122
01:56:14,342 --> 01:56:15,593
What kind of pancakes
you want, Ray?

2123
01:56:15,594 --> 01:56:17,428
- Pancakes.
- Yeah. What kind?

2124
01:56:17,429 --> 01:56:19,346
- Pancakes.
- Of course.

2125
01:56:19,347 --> 01:56:22,224
Course, maple syrup is supposed to
be on the table before the pancakes.

2126
01:56:22,225 --> 01:56:23,267
- Ray.
- Yeah.

2127
01:56:23,268 --> 01:56:25,115
Ta-da.

2128
01:56:27,439 --> 01:56:29,064
Charlie Babbitt made a joke.

2129
01:56:29,065 --> 01:56:31,242
- I made a joke, Ray.
- Yeah.

2130
01:56:51,213 --> 01:56:53,640
Step back a little bit, Ray.

2131
01:57:13,443 --> 01:57:15,415
Hello?

2132
01:57:16,112 --> 01:57:18,880
Why don't you go sit
down over there?

2133
01:57:22,410 --> 01:57:24,119
Hello?

2134
01:57:24,120 --> 01:57:25,955
This is not a legal
proceeding, Mr. Babbitt,

2135
01:57:25,956 --> 01:57:27,873
so there's no lawyers,
no judge present,

2136
01:57:27,874 --> 01:57:30,642
just the people who
care about Raymond.

2137
01:57:30,794 --> 01:57:32,753
Raymond, why don't you
have a seat over there?

2138
01:57:32,754 --> 01:57:34,505
Mr. Babbitt, why don't you go
to that side of the table?

2139
01:57:34,506 --> 01:57:36,298
Raymond, right here. Have a seat.

2140
01:57:36,299 --> 01:57:38,759
Raymond, right here.
Take this seat, okay?

2141
01:57:38,760 --> 01:57:40,553
Ray, you can put your
knapsack on the floor.

2142
01:57:40,554 --> 01:57:43,305
I think this is a good opportunity
to be honest with one another.

2143
01:57:43,306 --> 01:57:45,933
- And the TV. Ray, the TV.
- Yeah.

2144
01:57:45,934 --> 01:57:48,185
- On the floor. I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

2145
01:57:48,186 --> 01:57:51,564
I don't know any easy way
to say this, Mr. Babbitt...

2146
01:57:51,565 --> 01:57:52,773
To say what?

2147
01:57:52,774 --> 01:57:55,317
- Have I lost already?
- No, you haven't lost.

2148
01:57:55,318 --> 01:57:58,737
I'm not the judge and jury. I'm just a
doctor making a recommendation to a court.

2149
01:57:58,738 --> 01:58:00,030
Now, I must tell you
that Dr. Bruner

2150
01:58:00,031 --> 01:58:02,199
is a very respected professional.

2151
01:58:02,200 --> 01:58:05,077
Raymond's case has been meticulously
documented over the years,

2152
01:58:05,078 --> 01:58:08,330
and, of course, Wallbrook is one of the
finest institutions we have in this country.

2153
01:58:08,331 --> 01:58:10,624
Boy, you guys have already made
up your mind. I'll see you in court.

2154
01:58:10,625 --> 01:58:11,667
Hold on, son. No one's your enemy.

2155
01:58:11,668 --> 01:58:13,335
My brother came further
with me in a week

2156
01:58:13,336 --> 01:58:15,170
than he did with you in 20 years.
And that's the truth.

2157
01:58:15,171 --> 01:58:17,172
- I don't think...
- You don't know anything about us!

2158
01:58:17,173 --> 01:58:19,258
I don't think it's necessary
to challenge Dr. Bruner.

2159
01:58:19,259 --> 01:58:20,759
- I'm sorry.
- All right.

2160
01:58:20,760 --> 01:58:22,803
Exactly what happened
this past week, Raymond?

2161
01:58:22,804 --> 01:58:25,681
- Well, we got...
- I was asking Raymond.

2162
01:58:25,682 --> 01:58:28,655
Raymond, what happened
this past week?

2163
01:58:29,019 --> 01:58:31,020
- What did you do, Raymond?
- Counted cards.

2164
01:58:31,021 --> 01:58:33,105
- Counted cards?
- Counted cards in Las Vegas.

2165
01:58:33,106 --> 01:58:34,648
Your brother took you to Las Vegas?

2166
01:58:34,649 --> 01:58:37,192
$3,000 on the wheel of fortune.

2167
01:58:37,193 --> 01:58:39,194
He gave you $3,000 to gamble with?

2168
01:58:39,195 --> 01:58:42,448
Lost $3,000 on pitiful 20.

2169
01:58:42,449 --> 01:58:44,783
- What else did you do?
- Bet on number 20.

2170
01:58:44,784 --> 01:58:46,327
What else did you do?

2171
01:58:46,328 --> 01:58:47,953
Danced with Charlie Babbitt.

2172
01:58:47,954 --> 01:58:49,955
- Danced with your brother?
- He wanted to learn how to dance

2173
01:58:49,956 --> 01:58:51,790
- so I taught him.
- Danced in the elevator with Susanna.

2174
01:58:51,791 --> 01:58:53,042
Kissed Susanna.

2175
01:58:53,043 --> 01:58:55,252
- Kissed Susanna?
- Yeah. In the elevator.

2176
01:58:55,253 --> 01:58:57,129
Did you enjoy kissing a woman?

2177
01:58:57,130 --> 01:58:58,380
I don't know.

2178
01:58:58,381 --> 01:58:59,548
How did it feel?

2179
01:58:59,549 --> 01:59:00,758
It felt wet.

2180
01:59:00,759 --> 01:59:02,384
- Wet?
- Yeah.

2181
01:59:02,385 --> 01:59:04,653
- Quite a trip, huh?
- Yeah.

2182
01:59:05,639 --> 01:59:06,889
You enjoy being on the road?

2183
01:59:06,890 --> 01:59:08,265
I'm an excellent driver.

2184
01:59:08,266 --> 01:59:10,392
- You drove?
- Yeah.

2185
01:59:10,393 --> 01:59:12,728
Your brother let you drive on
the highway? The interstate?

2186
01:59:12,729 --> 01:59:13,979
Yeah, slow on the driveway.

2187
01:59:13,980 --> 01:59:16,532
He didn't drive on the highway.

2188
01:59:17,901 --> 01:59:19,568
Did he have any emotional
outbursts this past week?

2189
01:59:19,569 --> 01:59:20,653
What do you mean?

2190
01:59:20,654 --> 01:59:22,529
Well, things they tend to do.

2191
01:59:22,530 --> 01:59:24,573
Inflicting bodily
harm on themselves...

2192
01:59:24,574 --> 01:59:27,076
- Okay, yeah, a couple of times.
- A couple of times?

2193
01:59:27,077 --> 01:59:29,662
Okay, he had what you call
an outburst at the airport

2194
01:59:29,663 --> 01:59:32,247
because he didn't want to
fly, so we didn't fly.

2195
01:59:32,248 --> 01:59:33,874
When was the last
outburst that he had?

2196
01:59:33,875 --> 01:59:36,335
- This morning.
- This morning?

2197
01:59:36,336 --> 01:59:39,797
This is bullshit. Because I could tell
you anything, I could tell you nothing,

2198
01:59:39,798 --> 01:59:41,173
and you'd never know
the difference.

2199
01:59:41,174 --> 01:59:43,300
This morning the smoke
alarm went off.

2200
01:59:43,301 --> 01:59:45,094
He got a little
nervous, but he's fine.

2201
01:59:45,095 --> 01:59:47,971
Don't feel as though
I'm placing any blame.

2202
01:59:47,972 --> 01:59:49,306
We went out for pancakes.

2203
01:59:49,307 --> 01:59:52,267
- Look at him, he's fine.
- You don't have to be defensive.

2204
01:59:52,268 --> 01:59:53,811
- I'm not challenging you.
- I'm just being honest with you.

2205
01:59:53,812 --> 01:59:55,354
- You're missing the point.
- You're missing the point.

2206
01:59:55,355 --> 01:59:56,730
I'm being truthful about this.

2207
01:59:56,731 --> 01:59:59,525
The point I was trying to make
is I'm not placing any blame...

2208
01:59:59,526 --> 02:00:01,819
I had a father I hardly knew,
a mother I didn't know at all,

2209
02:00:01,820 --> 02:00:03,612
I find out a few days ago
that I have a brother,

2210
02:00:03,613 --> 02:00:05,614
and I wanna be with him and
I'm supposed to give him up?

2211
02:00:05,615 --> 02:00:07,366
No one is saying anything...

2212
02:00:07,367 --> 02:00:09,493
I didn't hurt him,
he's not hurting me,

2213
02:00:09,494 --> 02:00:12,371
we're not hurting you. Now, why are
you interfering? This is my family.

2214
02:00:12,372 --> 02:00:13,694
- I'm not interfering.
- This is my family.

2215
02:00:13,720 --> 02:00:15,541
- Do you understand that?
- I understand that.

2216
02:00:15,542 --> 02:00:16,667
Yes, you do have a brother,

2217
02:00:16,668 --> 02:00:19,962
but the point is he's not capable
of having a relationship with you.

2218
02:00:19,963 --> 02:00:23,006
That's your opinion. Did you spend 24
hours a day, seven days a week with him?

2219
02:00:23,007 --> 02:00:24,299
Have you ever done that?

2220
02:00:24,300 --> 02:00:26,051
Look, you cannot take
on the responsibility

2221
02:00:26,052 --> 02:00:27,386
of your brother without
professional guidance.

2222
02:00:27,387 --> 02:00:30,347
- That's your opinion, Dr. Bruner.
- Yes, it's my opinion.

2223
02:00:30,348 --> 02:00:32,224
There's a couple of things I'd
like to go over in this file.

2224
02:00:32,225 --> 02:00:36,103
Dr. Bruner states a week ago you
stole Raymond out of the institution

2225
02:00:36,104 --> 02:00:38,939
and you're willing to trade him for
$1.5 million. Is that correct?

2226
02:00:38,940 --> 02:00:40,983
My father died. I was upset.

2227
02:00:40,984 --> 02:00:42,609
- Okay? That was wrong.
- Okay.

2228
02:00:42,610 --> 02:00:43,986
So last week you were upset,

2229
02:00:43,987 --> 02:00:46,447
and then this week you suddenly
found some devotion to your brother

2230
02:00:46,448 --> 02:00:48,699
and you want to take care of
him the rest of your life?

2231
02:00:48,700 --> 02:00:50,752
Yes.

2232
02:00:50,994 --> 02:00:54,079
So in the beginning, it
was like a kidnapping.

2233
02:00:54,080 --> 02:00:56,081
Kidnapping... That's very strong.

2234
02:00:56,082 --> 02:00:57,541
I didn't kidnap my brother.

2235
02:00:57,542 --> 02:01:00,878
But in the course of the week, you came
to have an understanding with him.

2236
02:01:00,879 --> 02:01:02,087
Yes.

2237
02:01:02,088 --> 02:01:03,797
Look, that...

2238
02:01:03,798 --> 02:01:05,048
- Yes?
- When we...

2239
02:01:05,049 --> 02:01:07,468
I understand that this
sounds irrational to you.

2240
02:01:07,469 --> 02:01:09,720
Yes, when it started out, it had...

2241
02:01:09,721 --> 02:01:11,805
Don't feel compelled to
be defensive about that.

2242
02:01:11,806 --> 02:01:12,931
- Can I talk?
- Yes, you can.

2243
02:01:12,932 --> 02:01:15,601
- I'd like to talk. Thank you.
- Yes, you can.

2244
02:01:15,602 --> 02:01:17,060
There's no accusations.

2245
02:01:17,061 --> 02:01:18,353
Go ahead.

2246
02:01:18,354 --> 02:01:20,326
There's no accusations?

2247
02:01:21,608 --> 02:01:25,277
See, you have to understand that
when we started out together,

2248
02:01:25,278 --> 02:01:28,155
that he was only my brother

2249
02:01:28,156 --> 02:01:30,173
in name.

2250
02:01:33,495 --> 02:01:35,672
And as...

2251
02:01:38,374 --> 02:01:40,542
Then this morning we had pancakes.

2252
02:01:40,543 --> 02:01:41,585
Maple syrup.

2253
02:01:41,586 --> 02:01:43,086
Maple syrup on the...

2254
02:01:43,087 --> 02:01:45,172
- Maple syrup on the table.
- And pancakes.

2255
02:01:45,173 --> 02:01:48,021
And Charlie Babbitt made a joke.

2256
02:01:49,219 --> 02:01:51,191
You see, we...

2257
02:01:51,888 --> 02:01:54,014
I made a connection.

2258
02:01:54,015 --> 02:01:55,766
I think that's very admirable
that you made a connection,

2259
02:01:55,767 --> 02:01:58,143
but I think the purpose of
this meeting is to determine

2260
02:01:58,144 --> 02:01:59,561
what is best for Raymond.

2261
02:01:59,562 --> 02:02:02,564
Whether or not he's capable of
functioning in the community,

2262
02:02:02,565 --> 02:02:03,982
and what, in fact, he wants,

2263
02:02:03,983 --> 02:02:06,109
if that's possible to determine.

2264
02:02:06,110 --> 02:02:07,361
I'm all for that.

2265
02:02:07,362 --> 02:02:09,780
Raymond's unable to make
those kind of decisions.

2266
02:02:09,781 --> 02:02:10,864
You're wrong.

2267
02:02:10,865 --> 02:02:12,699
Charlie, you know he
can't decide for himself.

2268
02:02:12,700 --> 02:02:15,077
He's capable of a lot
more than you know.

2269
02:02:15,078 --> 02:02:18,163
Why don't we ask Raymond?
Maybe we can find a few answers.

2270
02:02:18,164 --> 02:02:21,262
Raymond, can I ask
you a few questions?

2271
02:02:21,417 --> 02:02:23,126
- Ray, the doctor's talking to you.
- Yeah?

2272
02:02:23,127 --> 02:02:25,725
- Raymond, can I ask you a few questions?
- Yeah.

2273
02:02:27,715 --> 02:02:30,563
Do you want to stay with
your brother Charlie?

2274
02:02:30,927 --> 02:02:34,054
Raymond, would you like to stay with
your brother Charlie in Los Angeles?

2275
02:02:34,055 --> 02:02:36,682
Ray, the doctor's
asking you a question,

2276
02:02:36,683 --> 02:02:38,976
- so you listen, okay, Ray?
- Yeah.

2277
02:02:38,977 --> 02:02:42,405
Raymond, do you want to stay
with your brother Charlie?

2278
02:02:42,939 --> 02:02:44,236
Raymond, do you want to stay...

2279
02:02:44,237 --> 02:02:46,208
- with your brother Charlie?
- Yeah.

2280
02:02:46,234 --> 02:02:48,443
- You do?
- Yeah.

2281
02:02:48,444 --> 02:02:51,029
- You want to stay with your brother?
- Yeah.

2282
02:02:51,030 --> 02:02:53,115
Stay with my brother,
Charlie Babbitt.

2283
02:02:53,116 --> 02:02:55,509
- That's what you want?
- Yeah.

2284
02:02:56,870 --> 02:03:00,093
- You want to stay with your brother?
- Yeah.

2285
02:03:02,792 --> 02:03:05,627
- Can I ask you something else, Raymond?
- Yeah.

2286
02:03:05,628 --> 02:03:08,146
- Do you want to go back to Wallbrook?
- Yeah.

2287
02:03:08,798 --> 02:03:12,134
Raymond, can you make a distinction
between your brother and Wallbrook?

2288
02:03:12,135 --> 02:03:13,982
Yeah.

2289
02:03:16,097 --> 02:03:17,764
Do you want to stay with
your brother Charlie

2290
02:03:17,765 --> 02:03:19,808
- here in Los Angeles?
- Yeah.

2291
02:03:19,809 --> 02:03:22,577
- Or do you wanna go back to Wallbrook?
- Yeah.

2292
02:03:22,979 --> 02:03:26,148
Two separate things, stay with your
brother or go back to Wallbrook?

2293
02:03:26,149 --> 02:03:27,816
It's not one thing, Raymond.

2294
02:03:27,817 --> 02:03:29,276
This is your brother.
You make a choice.

2295
02:03:29,277 --> 02:03:30,986
Back to Wallbrook,
stay with Charlie Babbitt.

2296
02:03:30,987 --> 02:03:32,070
Okay.

2297
02:03:32,071 --> 02:03:33,864
Back to Wallbrook, stay with
my brother Charlie Babbitt.

2298
02:03:33,865 --> 02:03:35,657
No, no, no. Two separate things.
Can you make that choice?

2299
02:03:35,658 --> 02:03:37,618
- One or the other.
- Yeah, go back to Wallbrook...

2300
02:03:37,619 --> 02:03:39,036
All right.

2301
02:03:39,037 --> 02:03:42,456
- Stay back at Wallbrook.
- Hold on. Just hold on!

2302
02:03:42,457 --> 02:03:45,125
- Stay back at Wallbrook.
- All right.

2303
02:03:45,126 --> 02:03:48,503
You made your point. Okay?
You don't have to humiliate him.

2304
02:03:48,504 --> 02:03:51,673
Ray, it's okay. It's over.

2305
02:03:51,674 --> 02:03:53,050
Yeah.

2306
02:03:53,051 --> 02:03:55,945
Stay back at Wallbrook
with Charlie Babbitt.

2307
02:03:56,179 --> 02:03:57,679
Stay back at Wallbrook.

2308
02:03:57,680 --> 02:03:59,056
It's over.

2309
02:03:59,057 --> 02:04:01,450
- Raymond?
- Yeah.

2310
02:04:04,270 --> 02:04:05,854
Dr. Bruner, can I talk
to you for a minute?

2311
02:04:05,855 --> 02:04:08,373
- Of course.
- Excuse me.

2312
02:04:16,157 --> 02:04:18,755
- You okay, Ray?
- Yeah.

2313
02:04:20,453 --> 02:04:22,268
You don't want any more
questions, do you?

2314
02:04:22,269 --> 02:04:25,433
- No.
- No.

2315
02:04:26,209 --> 02:04:28,477
I don't know.

2316
02:04:33,424 --> 02:04:36,009
You don't want any more questions,
do you? No more questions.

2317
02:04:36,010 --> 02:04:37,811
No.

2318
02:04:40,932 --> 02:04:43,225
Don't worry. There's not gonna
be any more questions, okay?

2319
02:04:43,226 --> 02:04:44,303
- Yeah.
- No more questions.

2320
02:04:44,304 --> 02:04:47,925
- I'll make sure of that, okay, Ray?
- Yeah. Main man.

2321
02:04:48,398 --> 02:04:50,950
- What?
- My main man.

2322
02:04:55,238 --> 02:04:57,335
Listen...

2323
02:05:00,410 --> 02:05:03,804
Ray, I don't know if I'm gonna have
a chance to talk to you again.

2324
02:05:07,083 --> 02:05:09,510
Because you see, these...

2325
02:05:09,711 --> 02:05:11,294
Dr. Bruner really likes you a lot,

2326
02:05:11,295 --> 02:05:14,923
and he's probably gonna want
to take you back with him.

2327
02:05:14,924 --> 02:05:17,226
- You know?
- Yeah.

2328
02:05:18,636 --> 02:05:19,803
But I just want you to know

2329
02:05:19,804 --> 02:05:23,824
that what I said about being
on the road with you, I meant.

2330
02:05:23,933 --> 02:05:26,110
Connecting.

2331
02:05:26,978 --> 02:05:28,645
I like having you for my brother.

2332
02:05:28,646 --> 02:05:31,414
I'm an excellent driver.

2333
02:05:32,900 --> 02:05:34,997
Yes, you are.

2334
02:06:01,596 --> 02:06:04,273
I like having you
for my big brother.

2335
02:06:06,851 --> 02:06:08,652
Yeah.

2336
02:06:22,700 --> 02:06:25,468
C-H-A-R-L-I-E.

2337
02:06:28,456 --> 02:06:31,600
C-H-A-R-L-I-E.

2338
02:06:32,168 --> 02:06:34,220
Main man.

2339
02:07:07,286 --> 02:07:09,287
<i>May I have your attention, please?</i>

2340
02:07:09,288 --> 02:07:13,583
<i>Amtrak train number 36,
the Desert Wind, eastbound,</i>

2341
02:07:13,584 --> 02:07:16,461
<i>now boarding, track number three.</i>

2342
02:07:16,462 --> 02:07:17,671
<i>Fullerton, San Bernardino.</i> ..

2343
02:07:17,672 --> 02:07:19,297
Ray.

2344
02:07:19,298 --> 02:07:24,524
<i>...Las Vegas, Salt Lake City,
Denver, Omaha, Chicago.</i>

2345
02:07:30,393 --> 02:07:32,936
- Hello, Charlie. Hello, Raymond.
- Dr. Bruner.

2346
02:07:32,937 --> 02:07:36,356
Wouldn't you feel a little more relaxed
in your favorite Kmart clothes?

2347
02:07:36,357 --> 02:07:38,066
- Tell him, Ray.
- Kmart sucks.

2348
02:07:38,067 --> 02:07:39,234
I see.

2349
02:07:39,235 --> 02:07:43,738
I have the tickets, and I'll be on
this car right here to the right.

2350
02:07:43,739 --> 02:07:45,365
Why don't you take a
couple of minutes?

2351
02:07:45,366 --> 02:07:47,509
See you, Charlie.

2352
02:07:48,411 --> 02:07:50,884
- You made a joke, Ray.
- Yeah.

2353
02:07:56,460 --> 02:07:58,253
I guess I better give this to you.

2354
02:07:58,254 --> 02:08:01,398
You're gonna have to
carry this now, it's...

2355
02:08:01,591 --> 02:08:04,769
It's got your cheese
balls, your apple juice,

2356
02:08:04,969 --> 02:08:07,095
notebooks, pens and...

2357
02:08:07,096 --> 02:08:09,598
"Who's on First"
video that you like.

2358
02:08:09,599 --> 02:08:11,433
"Who's on First." Very funny.

2359
02:08:11,434 --> 02:08:12,976
I told you it's funny.

2360
02:08:12,977 --> 02:08:14,949
Board!

2361
02:08:15,104 --> 02:08:16,229
Better get going.

2362
02:08:16,230 --> 02:08:17,564
Yeah. Very shiny train.

2363
02:08:17,565 --> 02:08:19,992
Yeah, it sure is.

2364
02:08:20,234 --> 02:08:23,278
Listen, Ray, Dr. Bruner
only has custody of you.

2365
02:08:23,279 --> 02:08:26,156
That doesn't mean I can't visit.

2366
02:08:26,157 --> 02:08:29,117
Now, I'm coming to see
you in two weeks.

2367
02:08:29,118 --> 02:08:30,911
How many days is that before
we're gonna be together?

2368
02:08:30,912 --> 02:08:33,246
14 days from today.
Today's Wednesday.

2369
02:08:33,247 --> 02:08:34,623
Hours?

2370
02:08:34,624 --> 02:08:37,083
336 hours.

2371
02:08:37,084 --> 02:08:39,261
Mystifying.

2372
02:08:39,462 --> 02:08:41,630
Course, that's 20,160 minutes.

2373
02:08:41,631 --> 02:08:44,799
1,209,600..

2374
02:08:44,800 --> 02:08:46,968
600 seconds.

2375
02:08:46,969 --> 02:08:48,861
Ray?

2376
02:08:49,764 --> 02:08:51,806
Ray?

2377
02:08:51,807 --> 02:08:53,608
Ray?

2378
02:08:54,352 --> 02:08:56,153
Yeah.

2379
02:09:00,483 --> 02:09:02,317
I'll see you soon.

2380
02:09:02,318 --> 02:09:05,416
Yeah. One for bad, two for good.

2381
02:09:09,075 --> 02:09:12,344
- Bet two for good.
- Yeah.

2382
02:09:22,755 --> 02:09:25,523
Course, three minutes to Wapner.

2383
02:09:25,967 --> 02:09:28,314
You'll make it.

2384
02:09:29,178 --> 02:09:31,230
Yeah.

2385
