2
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,925
Sméagol!

3
00:01:19,093 --> 00:01:21,335
I've got one!

4
00:01:21,971 --> 00:01:23,964
I've got a fish, Sméag. Sméagol!

5
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:27,260
Pull it in. Go on. Go on. Go on.
Pull it in.

6
00:01:35,485 --> 00:01:37,312
Déagol!

7
00:02:34,711 --> 00:02:36,537
Déagol?

8
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,332
Déagol.

9
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,226
Give us that, Déagol, my love.

10
00:03:04,198 --> 00:03:05,479
Why?

11
00:03:06,576 --> 00:03:08,818
Because...

12
00:03:08,995 --> 00:03:12,743
...it's my birthday and I wants it.

13
00:04:46,801 --> 00:04:52,043
My precious.

14
00:04:59,605 --> 00:05:02,523
They cursed us.

15
00:05:02,692 --> 00:05:04,067
Murderer.

16
00:05:04,235 --> 00:05:06,690
"Murderer" they called us.

17
00:05:06,862 --> 00:05:11,655
They cursed us
and drove us away.

18
00:05:12,785 --> 00:05:14,493
Gollum.

19
00:05:14,662 --> 00:05:16,370
Gollum.

20
00:05:16,539 --> 00:05:18,496
Gollum.

21
00:05:22,044 --> 00:05:25,045
And we wept, precious.

22
00:05:25,214 --> 00:05:28,797
We wept to be so alone.

23
00:05:31,387 --> 00:05:35,171
-- And cool
So nice for feet

24
00:05:36,183 --> 00:05:40,561
And we only wish
To catch a fish

25
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:43,980
So juicy sweet

26
00:05:49,739 --> 00:05:53,867
And we forgot the taste of bread...

27
00:05:54,034 --> 00:05:57,653
...the sound of trees...

28
00:05:58,539 --> 00:06:01,742
...the softness of the wind.

29
00:06:02,376 --> 00:06:08,046
We even forgot our own name.

30
00:06:16,182 --> 00:06:22,599
My precious.

31
00:07:06,857 --> 00:07:09,099
Wake up!

32
00:07:10,152 --> 00:07:11,812
Wake up!

33
00:07:11,987 --> 00:07:13,779
Wake up, sleepies.

34
00:07:13,948 --> 00:07:15,821
We must go, yes.

35
00:07:15,991 --> 00:07:18,661
We must go at once.

36
00:07:22,206 --> 00:07:25,290
Haven't you had any sleep, Mr. Frodo?

37
00:07:27,503 --> 00:07:30,041
I've gone and had too much.

38
00:07:31,423 --> 00:07:33,167
Must be getting late.

39
00:07:33,342 --> 00:07:34,836
No.

40
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:36,919
It isn't.

41
00:07:37,096 --> 00:07:40,132
It isn't midday yet.

42
00:07:40,307 --> 00:07:42,881
The days are growing darker.

43
00:07:47,147 --> 00:07:49,354
Come on!

44
00:07:51,777 --> 00:07:54,019
Must go! No time!

45
00:07:54,196 --> 00:07:56,568
Not before Mr. Frodo's
had something to eat.

46
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:59,611
No time to lose, silly.

47
00:08:08,377 --> 00:08:09,657
Here.

48
00:08:12,881 --> 00:08:14,708
What about you?

49
00:08:14,883 --> 00:08:18,252
Oh, no, I'm not hungry.
Leastways, not for lembas bread.

50
00:08:18,846 --> 00:08:20,221
Sam.

51
00:08:22,808 --> 00:08:24,350
All right.

52
00:08:24,518 --> 00:08:27,009
We don't have that much left.

53
00:08:27,187 --> 00:08:30,058
We have to be careful
or we're going to run out.

54
00:08:32,234 --> 00:08:35,152
You go ahead and eat that, Mr. Frodo.

55
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,731
I've rationed it.

56
00:08:37,239 --> 00:08:38,899
There should be enough.

57
00:08:41,076 --> 00:08:42,274
For what?

58
00:08:43,954 --> 00:08:45,697
The journey home.

59
00:08:53,547 --> 00:08:55,872
Come, Hobbitses.

60
00:08:57,259 --> 00:08:59,133
Very close now.

61
00:08:59,303 --> 00:09:02,553
Very close to Mordor.

62
00:09:02,723 --> 00:09:05,392
No safe places here.

63
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:07,717
Hurry.

64
00:10:00,113 --> 00:10:01,821
It's good.

65
00:10:02,741 --> 00:10:04,484
Definitely from the Shire.

66
00:10:06,703 --> 00:10:08,826
Longbottom Leaf.

67
00:10:14,169 --> 00:10:18,498
I feel like I'm back at
The Green Dragon.

68
00:10:19,591 --> 00:10:22,841
- Green Dragon.
- A mug of ale in my hand.

69
00:10:23,011 --> 00:10:27,590
Putting my feet up on a settle
after a hard day's work.

70
00:10:28,183 --> 00:10:31,634
Only, you've never done
a hard day's work.

71
00:10:44,449 --> 00:10:47,486
Welcome, my lords...

72
00:10:47,661 --> 00:10:49,903
...to Isengard!

73
00:10:50,288 --> 00:10:54,037
You young rascals!
A merry hunt you've led us on...

74
00:10:54,209 --> 00:10:59,204
...and now we find you feasting
and...and smoking!

75
00:10:59,381 --> 00:11:02,548
We are sitting on a field of victory...

76
00:11:02,718 --> 00:11:06,217
...enjoying a few well-earned comforts.

77
00:11:07,305 --> 00:11:11,137
The salted pork is particularly good.

78
00:11:11,685 --> 00:11:14,057
Salted pork?

79
00:11:15,272 --> 00:11:18,688
- Hobbits.
- We're under orders from Treebeard...

80
00:11:18,859 --> 00:11:21,694
...who's taken over management
of Isengard.

81
00:11:24,239 --> 00:11:27,240
Young Master Gandalf.

82
00:11:27,409 --> 00:11:31,987
I'm glad you've come.

83
00:11:32,164 --> 00:11:36,576
Wood and water, stock and stone
I can master.

84
00:11:36,751 --> 00:11:40,417
But there is a wizard to manage here...

85
00:11:40,589 --> 00:11:42,581
...locked in his tower.

86
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,588
Show yourself.

87
00:11:46,845 --> 00:11:48,553
Be careful.

88
00:11:49,347 --> 00:11:52,017
Even in defeat, Saruman is dangerous.

89
00:11:52,184 --> 00:11:54,307
Well, let's just have his head
and be done with it.

90
00:11:54,478 --> 00:11:56,517
No.

91
00:11:56,855 --> 00:11:59,180
We need him alive.

92
00:12:00,192 --> 00:12:02,765
We need him to talk.

93
00:12:04,654 --> 00:12:08,866
You have fought many wars
and slain many men, Théoden King...

94
00:12:09,034 --> 00:12:10,528
...and made peace afterwards.

95
00:12:10,702 --> 00:12:15,660
Can we not take counsel together
as we once did, my old friend?

96
00:12:15,832 --> 00:12:19,035
Can we not have peace, you and I?

97
00:12:19,211 --> 00:12:21,120
We shall have peace.

98
00:12:23,048 --> 00:12:25,171
We shall have peace...

99
00:12:25,342 --> 00:12:29,386
...when you answer
for the burning of the Westfold...

100
00:12:29,554 --> 00:12:32,306
...and the children that lie dead there!

101
00:12:33,058 --> 00:12:37,221
We shall have peace
when the lives of the soldiers...

102
00:12:37,395 --> 00:12:39,471
...whose bodies were hewn
even as they lay dead...

103
00:12:39,648 --> 00:12:43,182
...against the gates of the Hornburg,
are avenged!

104
00:12:44,736 --> 00:12:50,323
When you hang from a gibbet
for the sport of your own crows...

105
00:12:51,242 --> 00:12:53,484
...we shall have peace.

106
00:12:56,247 --> 00:12:58,952
Gibbets and crows?

107
00:12:59,292 --> 00:13:00,537
Dotard!

108
00:13:02,003 --> 00:13:04,838
What do you want, Gandalf Greyhame?

109
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,331
Let me guess. The Key of Orthanc.

110
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:11,427
Or perhaps the Keys of Barad-dûr itself...

111
00:13:11,596 --> 00:13:15,594
...along with the crowns of the seven kings
and the rods of the Five Wizards!

112
00:13:15,767 --> 00:13:18,721
Your treachery has already cost
many lives.

113
00:13:18,895 --> 00:13:21,267
Thousands more are now at risk.

114
00:13:21,439 --> 00:13:23,811
But you could save them, Saruman.

115
00:13:23,984 --> 00:13:26,272
You were deep in the enemy's counsel.

116
00:13:26,444 --> 00:13:29,730
So you have come here for information.

117
00:13:30,615 --> 00:13:32,442
I have some for you.

118
00:13:37,914 --> 00:13:40,868
Something festers
in the heart of Middle-earth.

119
00:13:41,042 --> 00:13:43,284
Something that you have failed to see.

120
00:13:45,797 --> 00:13:49,296
But the Great Eye has seen it.

121
00:13:50,343 --> 00:13:54,044
Even now he presses his advantage.

122
00:13:55,807 --> 00:13:59,140
His attack will come soon.

123
00:14:01,354 --> 00:14:03,477
You're all going to die.

124
00:14:05,984 --> 00:14:09,234
But you know this, don't you, Gandalf?

125
00:14:09,404 --> 00:14:14,030
You cannot think that this Ranger
will ever sit upon the throne of Gondor.

126
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:20,286
This exile, crept from the shadows,
will never be crowned king.

127
00:14:21,624 --> 00:14:25,289
Gandalf does not hesitate
to sacrifice those closest to him...

128
00:14:26,212 --> 00:14:28,419
...those he professes to love.

129
00:14:29,466 --> 00:14:34,009
Tell me, what words of comfort
did you give the Halfling...

130
00:14:34,179 --> 00:14:37,215
...before you sent him to his doom?

131
00:14:39,642 --> 00:14:44,351
The path that you have set him on
can only lead to death.

132
00:14:44,689 --> 00:14:46,847
I've heard enough!

133
00:14:47,025 --> 00:14:48,852
Shoot him.
Stick an arrow in his gob.

134
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,020
No.

135
00:14:51,487 --> 00:14:53,694
Come down, Saruman...

136
00:14:53,865 --> 00:14:57,815
- ...and your life will be spared.
- Save your pity and your mercy.

137
00:14:57,994 --> 00:14:59,322
I have no use for it!

138
00:15:08,546 --> 00:15:10,005
Saruman...

139
00:15:11,049 --> 00:15:14,215
...your staff is broken.

140
00:15:25,104 --> 00:15:28,556
Grima, you need not follow him.

141
00:15:29,734 --> 00:15:32,403
You were not always as you are now.

142
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:35,405
You were once a Man of Rohan.

143
00:15:35,573 --> 00:15:36,818
Come down.

144
00:15:36,991 --> 00:15:39,696
A Man of Rohan?

145
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,862
What is the house of Rohan...

146
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:46,704
...but a thatched barn
where brigands drink in the reek...

147
00:15:46,876 --> 00:15:50,577
...and their brats roll on the floor
with the dogs?

148
00:15:51,089 --> 00:15:57,542
The victory at Helm's Deep does not
belong to you, Théoden Horse-master.

149
00:15:58,179 --> 00:16:02,758
You are a lesser son of greater sires.

150
00:16:05,103 --> 00:16:06,811
Grima...

151
00:16:07,647 --> 00:16:09,521
...come down.

152
00:16:09,857 --> 00:16:11,268
Be free of him.

153
00:16:11,442 --> 00:16:15,440
- Free? He will never be free.
- No.

154
00:16:15,822 --> 00:16:18,443
Get down, cur!

155
00:16:20,201 --> 00:16:21,481
Saruman!

156
00:16:21,661 --> 00:16:24,282
You were deep in the enemy's counsel.

157
00:16:24,789 --> 00:16:26,947
Tell us what you know!

158
00:16:28,459 --> 00:16:33,702
You withdraw your guard, and I will tell you
where your doom will be decided.

159
00:16:33,881 --> 00:16:37,416
I will not be held prisoner here.

160
00:17:04,537 --> 00:17:06,079
Send word to all our allies...

161
00:17:06,247 --> 00:17:09,164
...and to every corner of Middle-earth
that still stands free.

162
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:12,829
The enemy moves against us.
We need to know where he will strike.

163
00:17:32,023 --> 00:17:35,972
The filth of Saruman...

164
00:17:36,152 --> 00:17:39,984
...is washing away.

165
00:17:40,156 --> 00:17:44,699
Trees will come back to live here.

166
00:17:45,203 --> 00:17:47,361
Young trees.

167
00:17:47,538 --> 00:17:49,745
- Wild trees.
- Pippin!

168
00:17:59,217 --> 00:18:01,375
Bless my bark!

169
00:18:01,552 --> 00:18:03,426
Peregrin Took!

170
00:18:03,596 --> 00:18:06,217
I'll take that, my lad.

171
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:08,264
Quickly, now.

172
00:18:58,442 --> 00:19:04,029
Tonight we remember those who
gave their blood to defend this country.

173
00:19:04,699 --> 00:19:06,738
Hail the victorious dead.

174
00:19:06,909 --> 00:19:08,320
Hail!

175
00:19:19,296 --> 00:19:21,206
No pauses.

176
00:19:21,382 --> 00:19:25,545
- No spills.
- And no regurgitation.

177
00:19:26,053 --> 00:19:27,713
So it's a drinking game?

178
00:19:29,265 --> 00:19:31,969
Last one standing wins.

179
00:19:36,313 --> 00:19:38,306
What'll we drink to?
Let's drink to victory!

180
00:19:38,482 --> 00:19:39,893
To victory!

181
00:20:23,861 --> 00:20:25,521
I am happy for you.

182
00:20:25,905 --> 00:20:28,312
He is an honourable man.

183
00:20:28,741 --> 00:20:31,196
You are both honourable men.

184
00:20:33,037 --> 00:20:38,375
It was not Théoden of Rohan
who led our people to victory.

185
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,377
Don't listen to me.

186
00:20:49,219 --> 00:20:50,714
You are young.

187
00:20:50,888 --> 00:20:53,213
And tonight is for you.

188
00:21:07,571 --> 00:21:09,231
Here, here.

189
00:21:10,741 --> 00:21:16,660
It's the Dwarves that go swimming
with little, hairy women.

190
00:21:22,044 --> 00:21:23,289
I feel something.

191
00:21:25,422 --> 00:21:27,913
A slight tingle in my fingers.

192
00:21:28,634 --> 00:21:30,211
I think it's affecting me.

193
00:21:32,137 --> 00:21:33,845
What did I say?

194
00:21:34,014 --> 00:21:37,348
He can't hold his liquor.

195
00:21:44,692 --> 00:21:46,020
Game over.

196
00:21:46,193 --> 00:21:49,609
Oh, you can search far and wide
You can drink the whole town dry

197
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:53,730
But you'll never find a beer so brown
But you'll never find a beer so brown

198
00:21:53,909 --> 00:21:58,286
As the one we drink in our hometown
As the one we drink in our hometown

199
00:21:58,455 --> 00:22:02,370
You can drink your fancy ales
You can drink 'em by the flagon

200
00:22:02,543 --> 00:22:05,709
But the only brew for the brave and true

201
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,621
Pippin!

202
00:22:10,092 --> 00:22:13,128
But the only brew for the brave and true

203
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:16,175
Comes from The Green Dragon

204
00:22:18,892 --> 00:22:21,727
Thank you! I win!

205
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,971
No news of Frodo?

206
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:29,649
No word. Nothing.

207
00:22:30,487 --> 00:22:32,646
We have time.

208
00:22:34,158 --> 00:22:37,443
Every day, Frodo moves closer to Mordor.

209
00:22:38,203 --> 00:22:40,279
Do we know that?

210
00:22:44,126 --> 00:22:45,834
What does your heart tell you?

211
00:22:52,885 --> 00:22:56,218
That Frodo is alive.

212
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:00,181
Yes.

213
00:23:02,769 --> 00:23:04,928
Yes, he's alive.

214
00:23:07,191 --> 00:23:10,026
Too risky. Too risky.

215
00:23:10,193 --> 00:23:11,438
Thieves.

216
00:23:11,612 --> 00:23:13,651
They stole it from us.

217
00:23:13,822 --> 00:23:17,321
Kill them. Kill them. Kill them both.

218
00:23:19,369 --> 00:23:22,204
Quiet! Mustn't wake them.

219
00:23:22,372 --> 00:23:24,910
Mustn't ruin it now.

220
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:27,159
But they knows.

221
00:23:27,336 --> 00:23:29,209
They knows.

222
00:23:29,379 --> 00:23:32,001
They suspects us.

223
00:23:33,216 --> 00:23:36,751
What's it saying, my precious, my love?

224
00:23:36,929 --> 00:23:40,511
Is Sméagol losing his nerve?

225
00:23:41,183 --> 00:23:43,555
No. Not.

226
00:23:43,727 --> 00:23:47,974
Never. Sméagol hates nasty Hobbitses.

227
00:23:48,148 --> 00:23:52,976
Sméagol wants to see them dead.

228
00:23:53,153 --> 00:23:55,691
And we will.

229
00:23:55,864 --> 00:23:59,909
Sméagol did it once.
He can do it again.

230
00:24:03,246 --> 00:24:05,916
It's ours!

231
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:08,752
Ours!

232
00:24:09,878 --> 00:24:12,749
We must get the precious.
We must get it back.

233
00:24:12,923 --> 00:24:16,339
Patience! Patience, my love.

234
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:20,887
First we must lead them to her.

235
00:24:21,765 --> 00:24:26,759
We lead them to the Winding Stair.

236
00:24:26,937 --> 00:24:29,606
Yes, the stairs. And then?

237
00:24:29,773 --> 00:24:32,774
Up, up, up, up,
up the stairs we go...

238
00:24:32,943 --> 00:24:39,361
...until we come to the tunnel.

239
00:24:39,741 --> 00:24:42,861
And when they go in...

240
00:24:43,036 --> 00:24:45,823
...there's no coming out.

241
00:24:46,748 --> 00:24:49,619
She's always hungry.

242
00:24:50,377 --> 00:24:54,588
She always needs to feed.

243
00:24:54,756 --> 00:24:56,167
She must eat.

244
00:24:56,341 --> 00:24:58,464
All she gets is filthy Orcses.

245
00:24:58,635 --> 00:25:01,387
And they doesn't taste very nice,
does they, precious?

246
00:25:02,013 --> 00:25:03,638
No.

247
00:25:03,807 --> 00:25:08,516
Not very nice at all, my love.

248
00:25:08,687 --> 00:25:11,474
She hungers for sweeter meats.

249
00:25:11,648 --> 00:25:13,475
Hobbit meat.

250
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:18,478
And when she throws away the bones
and the empty clothes...

251
00:25:18,655 --> 00:25:21,739
...then we will find it.

252
00:25:21,908 --> 00:25:26,238
And take it for me!

253
00:25:27,998 --> 00:25:29,408
For us.

254
00:25:29,916 --> 00:25:32,917
Yes. We meant "for us."

255
00:25:33,086 --> 00:25:36,537
Gollum. Gollum.

256
00:25:36,715 --> 00:25:41,211
The precious will be ours...

257
00:25:41,386 --> 00:25:45,882
...once the Hobbitses are dead!

258
00:25:46,391 --> 00:25:47,850
You treacherous little toad!

259
00:25:50,562 --> 00:25:52,851
No! No! Master!

260
00:25:53,023 --> 00:25:54,647
No, Sam! Leave him alone!

261
00:25:55,525 --> 00:25:58,194
I heard it from his own mouth.
He means to murder us.

262
00:25:58,361 --> 00:26:02,525
Never! Sméagol wouldn't hurt a fly.

263
00:26:04,034 --> 00:26:06,607
He's a horrid, fat Hobbit...

264
00:26:06,786 --> 00:26:08,364
...who hates Sméagol...

265
00:26:08,538 --> 00:26:11,325
...and who makes up nasty lies.

266
00:26:11,499 --> 00:26:14,169
You miserable little maggot!
I'll stove your head in!

267
00:26:14,544 --> 00:26:15,825
Sam!

268
00:26:16,212 --> 00:26:18,501
Call me a liar? You're a liar!

269
00:26:19,466 --> 00:26:23,380
- You scare him off, we're lost!
- I don't care! I can't do it, Mr. Frodo.

270
00:26:23,553 --> 00:26:26,720
- I won't wait around for him to kill us!
- I'm not sending him away.

271
00:26:27,057 --> 00:26:28,385
You don't see it, do you?

272
00:26:28,808 --> 00:26:30,219
He's a villain.

273
00:26:31,227 --> 00:26:34,846
We can't do this by ourselves, Sam.
Not without a guide.

274
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:38,561
I need you on my side.

275
00:26:39,361 --> 00:26:41,686
I'm on your side, Mr. Frodo.

276
00:26:43,198 --> 00:26:46,152
I know, Sam. I know.

277
00:26:46,701 --> 00:26:48,694
Trust me.

278
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:51,242
Come, Sméagol.

279
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:00,649
What time is it?

280
00:28:02,986 --> 00:28:04,480
Not yet dawn.

281
00:28:11,411 --> 00:28:14,447
I dreamed I saw a great wave...

282
00:28:14,622 --> 00:28:18,620
...climbing over green lands
and above the hills.

283
00:28:19,878 --> 00:28:22,333
I stood upon the brink.

284
00:28:23,256 --> 00:28:26,423
It was utterly dark in the abyss
before my feet.

285
00:28:28,344 --> 00:28:31,131
A light shone behind me...

286
00:28:31,764 --> 00:28:34,172
...but I could not turn.

287
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:37,766
I could only stand there, waiting.

288
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:41,935
Night changes many thoughts.

289
00:28:42,317 --> 00:28:44,475
Sleep, Éowyn.

290
00:28:45,028 --> 00:28:47,269
Sleep...

291
00:28:49,991 --> 00:28:51,865
...while you can.

292
00:29:16,017 --> 00:29:18,306
The stars are veiled.

293
00:29:19,312 --> 00:29:22,811
Something stirs in the east.

294
00:29:23,483 --> 00:29:26,602
A sleepless malice.

295
00:29:28,613 --> 00:29:31,400
The Eye of the enemy is moving.

296
00:29:44,837 --> 00:29:47,542
What are you doing?

297
00:29:52,178 --> 00:29:53,637
Pippin!

298
00:30:01,145 --> 00:30:02,889
Pippin?

299
00:30:15,785 --> 00:30:17,113
Pippin.

300
00:30:17,787 --> 00:30:20,456
- What, are you mad?
- I just want to look at it.

301
00:30:20,623 --> 00:30:21,738
Just one more time.

302
00:30:21,999 --> 00:30:24,075
Put it back.

303
00:30:34,345 --> 00:30:36,136
Pippin.

304
00:30:42,645 --> 00:30:44,139
No!

305
00:30:49,235 --> 00:30:50,480
Pippin.

306
00:30:53,823 --> 00:30:55,021
He is here.

307
00:30:55,199 --> 00:30:57,488
I see you.

308
00:31:00,496 --> 00:31:02,121
Pippin!

309
00:31:16,762 --> 00:31:19,514
Help! Gandalf, help!

310
00:31:21,267 --> 00:31:23,141
Someone help him!

311
00:31:29,525 --> 00:31:30,723
Pippin!

312
00:31:31,861 --> 00:31:33,106
Fool of a Took!

313
00:31:54,216 --> 00:31:56,423
Look at me.

314
00:31:58,387 --> 00:32:02,515
Gandalf, forgive me.

315
00:32:02,683 --> 00:32:04,557
Look at me.

316
00:32:04,727 --> 00:32:06,554
What did you see?

317
00:32:10,066 --> 00:32:12,142
A tree.

318
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:14,984
There was a white tree...

319
00:32:15,154 --> 00:32:16,648
...in a courtyard of stone.

320
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:20,730
It was dead.

321
00:32:24,914 --> 00:32:26,741
The city was burning.

322
00:32:26,916 --> 00:32:30,285
Minas Tirith? Is that what you saw?

323
00:32:30,961 --> 00:32:33,001
I saw...

324
00:32:36,384 --> 00:32:37,759
I saw him.

325
00:32:40,763 --> 00:32:43,005
I could hear his voice in my head.

326
00:32:43,182 --> 00:32:45,590
And what did you tell him?

327
00:32:45,768 --> 00:32:47,595
Speak!

328
00:32:51,774 --> 00:32:54,941
He asked me my name.
I didn't answer.

329
00:32:55,111 --> 00:32:56,569
He hurt me.

330
00:32:56,737 --> 00:32:59,193
What did you tell him
about Frodo and the Ring?

331
00:33:02,701 --> 00:33:05,157
There was no lie in Pippin's eyes.

332
00:33:05,996 --> 00:33:08,238
A fool...

333
00:33:08,415 --> 00:33:10,704
...but an honest fool he remains.

334
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:14,703
He told Sauron nothing
of Frodo and the Ring.

335
00:33:15,756 --> 00:33:18,128
We've been strangely fortunate.

336
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:22,168
Pippin saw in the palantir
a glimpse of the enemy's plan.

337
00:33:23,097 --> 00:33:27,047
Sauron moves to strike
the city of Minas Tirith.

338
00:33:27,643 --> 00:33:31,392
His defeat at Helm's Deep
showed our enemy one thing.

339
00:33:31,564 --> 00:33:33,889
He knows the heir of Elendil
has come forth.

340
00:33:34,066 --> 00:33:36,189
Men are not as weak as he supposed.

341
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:40,144
There is courage still, strength
enough perhaps to challenge him.

342
00:33:40,364 --> 00:33:42,238
Sauron fears this.

343
00:33:42,408 --> 00:33:46,737
He will not risk the peoples of
Middle-earth uniting under one banner.

344
00:33:47,913 --> 00:33:50,321
He will raze Minas Tirith
to the ground...

345
00:33:50,499 --> 00:33:53,998
...before he sees a king
return to the throne of Men.

346
00:33:54,169 --> 00:33:58,084
If the beacons of Gondor are lit,
Rohan must be ready for war.

347
00:33:59,008 --> 00:34:01,214
Tell me...

348
00:34:01,385 --> 00:34:05,169
...why should we ride to the aid
of those who did not come to ours?

349
00:34:09,059 --> 00:34:10,886
What do we owe Gondor?

350
00:34:12,021 --> 00:34:14,060
- I will go.
- No!

351
00:34:14,231 --> 00:34:17,398
- They must be warned.
- They will be.

352
00:34:20,821 --> 00:34:23,359
You must come to Minas Tirith
by another road.

353
00:34:23,907 --> 00:34:28,368
Follow the river.
Look to the black ships.

354
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:31,287
Understand this:

355
00:34:31,457 --> 00:34:35,122
Things are now in motion
that cannot be undone.

356
00:34:36,629 --> 00:34:38,705
I ride for Minas Tirith...

357
00:34:40,966 --> 00:34:43,635
...and I won't be going alone.

358
00:34:45,387 --> 00:34:49,052
Of all the inquisitive Hobbits,
Peregrin Took, you are the worst.

359
00:34:50,059 --> 00:34:51,719
Hurry! Hurry!

360
00:34:53,228 --> 00:34:54,639
Where are we going?

361
00:34:54,813 --> 00:34:56,058
Why did you look?

362
00:34:56,231 --> 00:34:58,983
Why do you always have to look?

363
00:34:59,151 --> 00:35:02,235
- I don't know. I can't help it.
- You never can.

364
00:35:02,696 --> 00:35:04,107
I'm sorry, all right?

365
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:09,117
- I won't do it again.
- Don't you understand?

366
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:11,827
The enemy thinks you have the Ring.

367
00:35:11,997 --> 00:35:15,746
He's going to be looking for you, Pip.
They have to get you out of here.

368
00:35:17,169 --> 00:35:19,838
And you-- ? You're coming with me?

369
00:35:22,049 --> 00:35:23,460
Merry?

370
00:35:23,634 --> 00:35:24,914
Come on.

371
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:31,808
How far is Minas Tirith?

372
00:35:31,975 --> 00:35:34,597
Three days' ride, as the Nazgûl flies.

373
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:38,269
And you better hope we don't have
one of those on our tail.

374
00:35:38,982 --> 00:35:40,477
Here.

375
00:35:40,651 --> 00:35:42,442
Something for the road.

376
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,277
The last of the Longbottom Leaf.

377
00:35:45,447 --> 00:35:49,445
I know you've run out.
You smoke too much, Pippin.

378
00:35:49,618 --> 00:35:52,109
But-- But we'll see each other soon.

379
00:35:55,457 --> 00:35:57,948
- Won't we?
- I don't know.

380
00:35:59,962 --> 00:36:02,001
I don't know what's going to happen.

381
00:36:02,172 --> 00:36:03,880
- Merry.
- Run, Shadowfax.

382
00:36:04,049 --> 00:36:05,508
Show us the meaning of haste.

383
00:36:05,676 --> 00:36:07,585
Merry!

384
00:36:18,063 --> 00:36:19,178
Merry!

385
00:36:29,658 --> 00:36:31,152
He's always followed me...

386
00:36:31,827 --> 00:36:33,866
...everywhere I went...

387
00:36:34,204 --> 00:36:35,996
...since before we were tweens.

388
00:36:37,165 --> 00:36:41,080
I would get him into
the worst sort of trouble...

389
00:36:41,253 --> 00:36:43,329
...but I was always there to get him out.

390
00:36:45,799 --> 00:36:47,673
Now he's gone.

391
00:36:49,344 --> 00:36:52,262
Just like Frodo and Sam.

392
00:36:52,889 --> 00:36:55,641
One thing I have learned about Hobbits:

393
00:36:55,809 --> 00:36:57,469
They're a most hardy folk.

394
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:01,720
Foolhardy, maybe. He's a Took.

395
00:37:16,204 --> 00:37:18,493
Take her by the safest road.

396
00:37:18,665 --> 00:37:21,156
A ship lies anchored
in the Grey Havens.

397
00:37:21,335 --> 00:37:25,202
It waits to carry her across the sea.

398
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:28,749
The last journey of Arwen Undómiel.

399
00:38:34,366 --> 00:38:37,450
There is nothing for you here...

400
00:38:37,953 --> 00:38:40,159
...only death.

401
00:38:47,462 --> 00:38:48,743
Lady Arwen...

402
00:38:49,673 --> 00:38:51,582
...we cannot delay.

403
00:38:54,052 --> 00:38:55,297
My lady!

404
00:39:14,698 --> 00:39:17,319
- Tell me what you have seen.
- Arwen.

405
00:39:17,492 --> 00:39:19,449
You have the gift of foresight.

406
00:39:19,619 --> 00:39:21,411
What did you see?

407
00:39:22,038 --> 00:39:25,372
I looked into your future,
and I saw death.

408
00:39:25,917 --> 00:39:28,040
But there is also life.

409
00:39:29,963 --> 00:39:34,008
You saw there was a child.
You saw my son.

410
00:39:34,634 --> 00:39:37,172
That future is almost gone.

411
00:39:37,345 --> 00:39:39,338
But it is not lost.

412
00:39:41,933 --> 00:39:44,140
Nothing is certain.

413
00:39:45,854 --> 00:39:48,559
Some things are certain.

414
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:55,195
If I leave him now...

415
00:39:55,363 --> 00:39:57,985
... I will regret it forever.

416
00:39:59,075 --> 00:40:01,401
It is time.

417
00:40:06,666 --> 00:40:10,450
From the ashes a fire shall be woken

418
00:40:10,628 --> 00:40:14,044
A light from the shadow shall spring

419
00:40:14,215 --> 00:40:17,501
Renewed shall be blade that was broken

420
00:40:24,893 --> 00:40:28,096
The crownless again shall be king

421
00:40:31,858 --> 00:40:33,898
Re-forge the sword.

422
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:11,475
Your hands are cold.

423
00:41:14,859 --> 00:41:17,979
The life of the Eldar is leaving you.

424
00:41:21,407 --> 00:41:23,317
This was my choice.

425
00:41:25,161 --> 00:41:27,450
Whether by your will or not...

426
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:33,084
...there is no ship now
that can bear me hence.

427
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:23,135
We've just passed
into the realm of Gondor.

428
00:42:34,772 --> 00:42:37,014
Minas Tirith.

429
00:42:37,608 --> 00:42:39,934
City of kings.

430
00:43:11,309 --> 00:43:13,100
Make way!

431
00:43:42,298 --> 00:43:44,125
It's the tree.

432
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:45,960
Gandalf. Gandalf.

433
00:43:46,135 --> 00:43:48,377
Yes, the White Tree of Gondor.

434
00:43:48,554 --> 00:43:50,381
The tree of the king.

435
00:43:50,556 --> 00:43:53,226
Lord Denethor, however,
is not king.

436
00:43:53,392 --> 00:43:56,062
He is a steward only,
a caretaker of the throne.

437
00:43:56,813 --> 00:44:00,347
Now listen carefully.
Lord Denethor is Boromir's father.

438
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:04,684
To give him news of his beloved son's
death would be most unwise.

439
00:44:05,154 --> 00:44:08,606
And do not mention Frodo or the Ring.

440
00:44:09,492 --> 00:44:12,244
And say nothing of Aragorn either.

441
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:17,947
In fact, it's better if you
don't speak at all, Peregrin Took.

442
00:44:48,114 --> 00:44:54,615
Hail Denethor, son of Ecthelion,
lord and steward of Gondor.

443
00:45:00,126 --> 00:45:04,835
I come with tidings in this dark hour,
and with counsel.

444
00:45:05,798 --> 00:45:09,167
Perhaps you come to explain this.

445
00:45:14,807 --> 00:45:19,350
Perhaps you come to tell me
why my son is dead.

446
00:45:33,826 --> 00:45:36,827
Boromir died to save us...

447
00:45:36,996 --> 00:45:38,656
...my kinsman and me.

448
00:45:38,831 --> 00:45:42,330
- He fell defending us from many foes.
- Pippin.

449
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:51,291
I offer you my service, such as it is...

450
00:45:51,844 --> 00:45:53,837
...in payment of this debt.

451
00:45:56,015 --> 00:45:59,348
This is my first command to you.

452
00:46:00,061 --> 00:46:03,512
How did you escape
and my son did not...

453
00:46:03,856 --> 00:46:06,181
...so mighty a man as he was?

454
00:46:06,859 --> 00:46:10,193
The mightiest man
may be slain by one arrow...

455
00:46:10,446 --> 00:46:12,355
...and Boromir was pierced by many.

456
00:46:16,494 --> 00:46:18,202
Get up.

457
00:46:18,370 --> 00:46:22,997
My lord, there will be a time
to grieve for Boromir...

458
00:46:23,459 --> 00:46:25,202
...but it is not now.

459
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,126
War is coming.

460
00:46:28,464 --> 00:46:32,877
The enemy is on your doorstep.
As steward, you are charged...

461
00:46:33,052 --> 00:46:37,215
...with the defense of this city.
Where are Gondor's armies?

462
00:46:37,389 --> 00:46:42,265
You still have friends.
You are not alone in this fight.

463
00:46:42,436 --> 00:46:46,932
Send word to Théoden of Rohan.
Light the beacons.

464
00:46:48,526 --> 00:46:52,060
You think you are wise, Mithrandir.

465
00:46:52,238 --> 00:46:55,274
Yet for all your subtleties,
you have not wisdom.

466
00:46:57,409 --> 00:47:01,573
Do you think the eyes
of the White Tower are blind?

467
00:47:01,747 --> 00:47:04,831
I have seen more than you know.

468
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,204
With your left hand you would use me
as a shield against Mordor.

469
00:47:08,379 --> 00:47:11,249
And with your right
you'd seek to supplant me.

470
00:47:11,423 --> 00:47:15,124
I know who rides with Théoden of Rohan.

471
00:47:15,302 --> 00:47:21,257
Oh, yes. Word has reached my ears
of this Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

472
00:47:21,433 --> 00:47:26,261
And I tell you now, I will not bow
to this Ranger from the North...

473
00:47:26,438 --> 00:47:30,935
...last of a ragged house
long bereft of lordship.

474
00:47:31,110 --> 00:47:36,946
Authority is not given to you
to deny the return of the king, steward.

475
00:47:37,116 --> 00:47:41,528
The rule of Gondor is mine
and no other's.

476
00:47:46,709 --> 00:47:48,500
Come.

477
00:47:56,427 --> 00:47:59,000
All has turned to vain ambition.

478
00:47:59,179 --> 00:48:02,631
He would even use his grief
as a cloak.

479
00:48:05,519 --> 00:48:08,306
A thousand years
this city has stood.

480
00:48:09,398 --> 00:48:11,806
Now, at the whim of a madman,
it will fall.

481
00:48:13,027 --> 00:48:15,233
And the White Tree,
the tree of the king...

482
00:48:15,404 --> 00:48:16,946
...will never bloom again.

483
00:48:17,114 --> 00:48:20,483
- Why are they still guarding it?
- They guard it because they have hope.

484
00:48:20,659 --> 00:48:23,826
A faint and fading hope
that one day it will flower.

485
00:48:23,996 --> 00:48:28,741
That a king will come
and this city will be as it once was...

486
00:48:28,917 --> 00:48:31,835
...before it fell into decay.

487
00:48:32,004 --> 00:48:35,254
The old wisdom borne out
of the West was forsaken.

488
00:48:35,424 --> 00:48:39,718
Kings made tombs more splendid
than the houses of the living...

489
00:48:39,928 --> 00:48:41,838
...and counted the old names
of their descent...

490
00:48:42,014 --> 00:48:44,801
...dearer than the names of their sons.

491
00:48:44,975 --> 00:48:50,017
Childless lords sat in aged halls,
musing on heraldry...

492
00:48:50,189 --> 00:48:55,527
...or in high, cold towers,
asking questions of the stars.

493
00:48:55,694 --> 00:48:59,478
And so the people of Gondor
fell into ruin.

494
00:49:00,449 --> 00:49:02,774
The line of kings failed.

495
00:49:03,494 --> 00:49:05,866
The White Tree withered.

496
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:10,744
The rule of Gondor was given over
to lesser men.

497
00:49:21,470 --> 00:49:22,715
Mordor.

498
00:49:23,222 --> 00:49:26,887
Yes, there it lies.

499
00:49:27,726 --> 00:49:31,060
This city has dwelt ever
in the sight of its shadow.

500
00:49:33,065 --> 00:49:34,725
A storm is coming.

501
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:38,318
This is not the weather of the world.

502
00:49:38,487 --> 00:49:40,693
This is a device of Sauron's making.

503
00:49:40,864 --> 00:49:44,613
A broil of fume
he sends ahead of his host.

504
00:49:45,202 --> 00:49:47,657
The Orcs of Mordor
have no love of daylight...

505
00:49:47,829 --> 00:49:49,656
...so he covers the face of the sun...

506
00:49:49,831 --> 00:49:53,580
...to ease their passage
along the road to war.

507
00:49:53,752 --> 00:49:57,038
When the Shadow of Mordor
reaches this city...

508
00:49:57,756 --> 00:49:59,464
...it will begin.

509
00:50:01,134 --> 00:50:02,712
Well...

510
00:50:03,095 --> 00:50:04,423
... Minas Tirith...

511
00:50:06,348 --> 00:50:07,759
...very impressive.

512
00:50:07,933 --> 00:50:10,554
- So where are we off to next?
- Oh, it's too late for that, Peregrin.

513
00:50:10,727 --> 00:50:12,934
There's no leaving this city.

514
00:50:15,274 --> 00:50:18,477
Help must come to us.

515
00:50:19,987 --> 00:50:22,656
It must be getting near teatime.

516
00:50:22,823 --> 00:50:26,523
Leastways, it would be in decent places
where there is still teatime.

517
00:50:26,702 --> 00:50:30,284
We're not in decent places.

518
00:50:35,836 --> 00:50:37,081
Mr. Frodo?

519
00:50:40,132 --> 00:50:41,330
What is it?

520
00:50:43,802 --> 00:50:46,174
It's just a feeling.

521
00:50:48,598 --> 00:50:50,757
I don't think I'll be coming back.

522
00:50:55,272 --> 00:50:57,810
Yes, you will. Of course you will.

523
00:50:58,442 --> 00:51:00,315
That's just morbid thinking.

524
00:51:00,777 --> 00:51:03,233
We're going there and back again...

525
00:51:03,405 --> 00:51:05,694
...just like Mr. Bilbo.

526
00:51:06,658 --> 00:51:08,781
You'll see.

527
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:20,578
I think these lands were once
part of the kingdom of Gondor.

528
00:51:24,968 --> 00:51:29,013
Long ago, when there was a king.

529
00:51:49,659 --> 00:51:52,495
Mr. Frodo, look.

530
00:51:54,122 --> 00:51:56,874
The king has got a crown again.

531
00:52:08,011 --> 00:52:12,258
Come on, Hobbits!
Mustn't stop now. This way.

532
00:52:29,115 --> 00:52:33,160
So I imagine this is just
a ceremonial position.

533
00:52:33,328 --> 00:52:37,575
I mean, they don't actually expect me
to do any fighting.

534
00:52:38,416 --> 00:52:41,666
- Do they?
- You're in the service of the steward now.

535
00:52:41,836 --> 00:52:45,205
You'll have to do as you're told,
Peregrin Took.

536
00:52:49,261 --> 00:52:51,752
Ridiculous Hobbit.

537
00:52:52,931 --> 00:52:55,137
Guard of the Citadel.

538
00:53:04,651 --> 00:53:06,478
Thank you.

539
00:53:15,870 --> 00:53:18,112
There's no more stars.

540
00:53:18,623 --> 00:53:19,821
Is it time?

541
00:53:21,001 --> 00:53:22,744
Yes.

542
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:27,040
It's so quiet.

543
00:53:28,049 --> 00:53:32,296
It's the deep breath before the plunge.

544
00:53:33,471 --> 00:53:36,342
I don't want to be in a battle...

545
00:53:37,183 --> 00:53:42,141
...but waiting on the edge of one
I can't escape is even worse.

546
00:53:45,692 --> 00:53:49,310
Is there any hope, Gandalf,
for Frodo and Sam?

547
00:53:50,655 --> 00:53:53,775
There never was much hope.

548
00:53:55,744 --> 00:53:57,487
Just a fool's hope.

549
00:54:03,376 --> 00:54:06,163
Our enemy is ready.

550
00:54:06,337 --> 00:54:09,007
His full strength's gathered.

551
00:54:09,174 --> 00:54:12,673
Not only Orcs, but Men as well.

552
00:54:12,844 --> 00:54:15,880
Legions of Haradrim from the south...

553
00:54:16,055 --> 00:54:18,760
...mercenaries from the coast.

554
00:54:18,933 --> 00:54:21,507
All will answer Mordor's call.

555
00:54:21,686 --> 00:54:23,228
Come on.

556
00:54:24,355 --> 00:54:27,689
This will be the end of Gondor
as we know it.

557
00:54:27,859 --> 00:54:31,228
Here the hammer stroke will fall hardest.

558
00:54:32,197 --> 00:54:36,526
If the river is taken,
if the garrison at Osgiliath falls...

559
00:54:36,701 --> 00:54:40,366
...the last defense of this city
will be gone.

560
00:54:40,538 --> 00:54:44,583
But we have the White Wizard.
That's got to count for something.

561
00:54:50,465 --> 00:54:52,042
Gandalf?

562
00:54:55,762 --> 00:54:59,427
Sauron has yet to reveal
his deadliest servant...

563
00:54:59,891 --> 00:55:03,723
...the one who will lead
Mordor's armies in war.

564
00:55:03,895 --> 00:55:09,055
The one they say no living man can kill.

565
00:55:10,068 --> 00:55:12,226
The Witch King of Angmar.

566
00:55:13,321 --> 00:55:15,693
You've met him before.

567
00:55:16,366 --> 00:55:18,939
He stabbed Frodo on Weathertop.

568
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:28,205
He is the lord of the Nazgûl...

569
00:55:28,670 --> 00:55:31,125
...the greatest of the Nine.

570
00:55:31,297 --> 00:55:34,915
Minas Morgul is his lair.

571
00:55:38,388 --> 00:55:41,922
The Dead City.

572
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:47,307
Very nasty place. Full of enemies.

573
00:55:54,529 --> 00:55:56,687
Quick. Quick.

574
00:55:56,864 --> 00:56:00,862
They will see. They will see.

575
00:56:10,128 --> 00:56:15,418
Come away. Come away.
Look, we have found it.

576
00:56:15,591 --> 00:56:19,459
The way into Mordor.

577
00:56:19,637 --> 00:56:23,966
The secret stair.

578
00:56:24,392 --> 00:56:26,764
Climb.

579
00:56:47,039 --> 00:56:49,791
- No, Mr. Frodo!
- Not that way!

580
00:56:54,630 --> 00:56:57,501
- What's it doing?
- No.

581
00:56:57,675 --> 00:57:00,759
- They're calling me.
- No.

582
00:57:30,416 --> 00:57:33,370
Hide! Hide!

583
00:58:16,921 --> 00:58:19,756
I can feel his blade.

584
00:58:31,435 --> 00:58:33,558
We come to it at last.

585
00:58:35,398 --> 00:58:38,268
The great battle of our time.

586
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:20,690
Come away, Hobbits.
We climb. We must climb.

587
00:59:30,578 --> 00:59:33,579
The board is set.

588
00:59:33,748 --> 00:59:36,285
The pieces are moving.

589
00:59:38,836 --> 00:59:41,505
Up, up, up the stairs we go.

590
00:59:41,672 --> 00:59:44,341
And then it's into the tunnel.

591
00:59:44,508 --> 00:59:47,711
Hey, what's in this tunnel?

592
00:59:48,262 --> 00:59:51,014
You listen to me,
and you listen good and proper.

593
00:59:51,182 --> 00:59:54,099
Anything happens to him,
you have me to answer to.

594
00:59:54,268 --> 00:59:55,846
One sniff something's not right...

595
00:59:56,020 --> 00:59:59,186
...one hair stands up
on the back of my head, it's over.

596
00:59:59,398 --> 01:00:02,067
No more slinker. No more stinker.

597
01:00:02,401 --> 01:00:05,022
You're gone. Got it?

598
01:00:05,905 --> 01:00:07,897
I'm watching you.

599
01:00:13,245 --> 01:00:15,238
What was that about?

600
01:00:15,414 --> 01:00:17,822
Nothing. Just clearing something up.

601
01:00:24,465 --> 01:00:27,335
Peregrin Took, my lad,
there is a task now to be done.

602
01:00:27,509 --> 01:00:32,088
Another opportunity for one
of the Shire-folk to prove their great worth.

603
01:00:36,936 --> 01:00:38,513
You must not fail me.

604
01:01:12,763 --> 01:01:15,847
It's been very quiet across the river.

605
01:01:16,016 --> 01:01:18,341
The Orcs are lying low.

606
01:01:18,519 --> 01:01:20,511
The garrison may have moved out.

607
01:01:21,647 --> 01:01:24,352
We've sent scouts to Cair Andros.

608
01:01:24,525 --> 01:01:27,810
If the Orcs attack from the north,
we'll have some warning.

609
01:01:53,137 --> 01:01:54,335
Quiet.

610
01:01:58,434 --> 01:02:00,391
We need 10 more.

611
01:02:21,707 --> 01:02:23,249
Kill him!

612
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:42,967
They're not coming from the north.

613
01:02:44,396 --> 01:02:48,725
To the river. Quick. Quick.
Go. Come on.

614
01:02:52,196 --> 01:02:53,773
Faster.

615
01:03:06,919 --> 01:03:09,291
Draw swords.

616
01:04:03,850 --> 01:04:06,424
Hold! Hold them!

617
01:05:26,725 --> 01:05:28,599
What?

618
01:05:41,156 --> 01:05:42,567
Amon Dîn.

619
01:05:48,371 --> 01:05:51,408
The beacon.
The beacon of Amon Dîn is lit.

620
01:05:54,669 --> 01:05:58,881
Hope is kindled.

621
01:07:31,266 --> 01:07:35,643
The beacons of Minas Tirith!
The beacons are lit!

622
01:07:36,855 --> 01:07:38,479
Gondor calls for aid.

623
01:07:48,992 --> 01:07:51,909
And Rohan will answer.

624
01:07:52,328 --> 01:07:55,116
Muster the Rohirrim.

625
01:08:10,221 --> 01:08:12,178
Assemble the army at Dunharrow.

626
01:08:12,348 --> 01:08:16,726
As many men as can be found.
You have two days.

627
01:08:16,895 --> 01:08:22,185
On the third,
we ride for Gondor and war.

628
01:08:23,151 --> 01:08:24,479
- Forward.
- Very good, sir.

629
01:08:24,652 --> 01:08:25,981
- Gamling.
- My lord.

630
01:08:26,154 --> 01:08:27,731
Make haste
across the Riddermark.

631
01:08:27,906 --> 01:08:30,029
Summon every able-bodied man
to Dunharrow.

632
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:31,777
I will.

633
01:08:35,872 --> 01:08:39,039
- Will you ride with us?
- Just to the encampment.

634
01:08:39,209 --> 01:08:43,123
It's tradition for the women
of the court to farewell the men.

635
01:08:49,677 --> 01:08:51,586
The men have found their captain.

636
01:08:51,763 --> 01:08:55,096
They will follow you into battle,
even to death.

637
01:08:55,266 --> 01:08:56,844
You have given us hope.

638
01:09:00,063 --> 01:09:02,020
Excuse me.

639
01:09:03,358 --> 01:09:04,852
I have a sword.

640
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:06,526
Please accept it.

641
01:09:07,654 --> 01:09:12,150
I offer you my service, Théoden King.

642
01:09:15,578 --> 01:09:17,654
And gladly I accept it.

643
01:09:18,748 --> 01:09:22,828
You shall be Meriadoc,
esquire of Rohan.

644
01:09:27,715 --> 01:09:28,913
Horse-Men.

645
01:09:29,592 --> 01:09:35,215
I wish I could muster a legion of Dwarves,
fully armed and filthy.

646
01:09:35,598 --> 01:09:38,552
Your kinsmen may have no need
to ride to war.

647
01:09:38,726 --> 01:09:42,142
I fear war already marches
on their own lands.

648
01:10:00,623 --> 01:10:04,074
So it is before the walls
of Minas Tirith...

649
01:10:04,252 --> 01:10:08,119
...the doom of our time will be decided.

650
01:10:10,716 --> 01:10:16,256
Now is the hour.
Riders of Rohan, oaths you have taken.

651
01:10:16,431 --> 01:10:19,965
Now, fulfill them all.
To lord and land!

652
01:11:03,060 --> 01:11:05,018
Faramir!

653
01:11:11,319 --> 01:11:15,019
We can't hold them. The city is lost.

654
01:11:15,615 --> 01:11:18,699
Tell the men to break cover.
We ride for Minas Tirith.

655
01:11:27,460 --> 01:11:29,702
Nazgûl.

656
01:11:32,089 --> 01:11:34,545
Take cover!

657
01:11:34,717 --> 01:11:37,255
Nazgûl!

658
01:11:37,428 --> 01:11:41,093
Fall back. Fall back to Minas Tirith!

659
01:11:47,688 --> 01:11:49,562
Fall back!

660
01:11:56,614 --> 01:12:01,192
- Retreat! Retreat!
- Run for your lives!

661
01:12:25,434 --> 01:12:29,764
The age of Men is over.

662
01:12:29,939 --> 01:12:35,562
The time of the Orc has come.

663
01:12:37,947 --> 01:12:40,272
- Keep going.
- It's the Nazgûl.

664
01:12:41,909 --> 01:12:44,281
Take cover, my lord!

665
01:12:44,578 --> 01:12:45,907
It's coming!

666
01:12:51,460 --> 01:12:54,829
- It's Mithrandir.
- The White Rider!

667
01:13:34,795 --> 01:13:36,170
Pull!

668
01:13:53,898 --> 01:13:56,305
Mithrandir.

669
01:13:56,483 --> 01:13:58,227
They broke through our defenses.

670
01:13:58,402 --> 01:14:00,608
They've taken the bridge
and the west bank.

671
01:14:01,697 --> 01:14:05,861
- Battalions of Orcs are crossing the river.
- It is as the Lord Denethor predicted.

672
01:14:06,035 --> 01:14:10,578
- Long has he foreseen this doom.
- Foreseen and done nothing.

673
01:14:13,959 --> 01:14:16,367
Faramir?

674
01:14:18,297 --> 01:14:22,129
This is not the first Halfling
to have crossed your path.

675
01:14:22,301 --> 01:14:24,507
No.

676
01:14:25,846 --> 01:14:27,388
You've seen Frodo and Sam?

677
01:14:28,265 --> 01:14:31,681
- Where? When?
- In lthilien.

678
01:14:31,852 --> 01:14:33,928
Not two days ago.

679
01:14:34,396 --> 01:14:38,857
Gandalf, they're taking the road
to the Morgul Vale.

680
01:14:39,568 --> 01:14:42,189
And then the pass of Cirith Ungol.

681
01:14:44,406 --> 01:14:46,778
What does that mean?

682
01:14:46,950 --> 01:14:51,862
- What's wrong?
- Faramir, tell me everything.

683
01:14:52,039 --> 01:14:54,078
Tell me all you know.

684
01:14:55,250 --> 01:14:58,666
This is how you would serve your city?

685
01:14:58,837 --> 01:15:02,123
You would risk its utter ruin?

686
01:15:03,175 --> 01:15:04,753
I did what I judged to be right.

687
01:15:05,469 --> 01:15:08,470
What you judged to be right.

688
01:15:09,098 --> 01:15:14,970
You sent the Ring of Power into Mordor
in the hands of a witless Halfling.

689
01:15:18,941 --> 01:15:23,768
It should have been brought back
to the Citadel to be kept safe.

690
01:15:25,406 --> 01:15:26,948
Hidden.

691
01:15:27,366 --> 01:15:30,118
Dark and deep in the vaults...

692
01:15:30,285 --> 01:15:32,444
...not to be used.

693
01:15:36,625 --> 01:15:41,501
Unless at the uttermost end of need.

694
01:15:41,964 --> 01:15:44,003
I would not use the Ring.

695
01:15:44,174 --> 01:15:47,259
Not if Minas Tirith were falling in ruin
and I alone could save her.

696
01:15:47,594 --> 01:15:52,422
Ever you desire to appear lordly
and gracious...

697
01:15:52,599 --> 01:15:54,841
...as a king of old.

698
01:15:56,645 --> 01:16:00,394
Boromir would have remembered
his father's need.

699
01:16:00,816 --> 01:16:03,271
He would have brought me a kingly gift.

700
01:16:03,485 --> 01:16:06,023
Boromir would not
have brought the Ring.

701
01:16:06,446 --> 01:16:09,566
He would have stretched out his hand to
this thing and taken it. He would've fallen.

702
01:16:09,741 --> 01:16:11,983
- You know nothing of this matter!
- He would have kept it for his own.

703
01:16:13,871 --> 01:16:16,029
And when he returned...

704
01:16:17,166 --> 01:16:18,826
...you would not have known your son.

705
01:16:19,001 --> 01:16:21,539
Boromir was loyal to me!

706
01:16:21,712 --> 01:16:24,285
Not some wizard's pupil!

707
01:16:32,431 --> 01:16:33,759
Father?

708
01:16:46,445 --> 01:16:48,354
My son.

709
01:17:14,598 --> 01:17:15,973
Leave me.

710
01:17:49,549 --> 01:17:52,087
Careful, master. Careful.

711
01:17:52,427 --> 01:17:55,345
Very far to fall.

712
01:17:57,849 --> 01:18:01,764
Very dangerous are the stairs.

713
01:18:04,439 --> 01:18:06,977
Come, master.

714
01:18:12,781 --> 01:18:15,948
Come to Sméagol.

715
01:18:22,290 --> 01:18:23,785
Mr. Frodo.

716
01:18:24,793 --> 01:18:26,335
Get back, you!

717
01:18:26,503 --> 01:18:28,709
Don't touch him!

718
01:18:32,843 --> 01:18:35,678
Why does he hates poor Sméagol?

719
01:18:35,846 --> 01:18:39,546
What has Sméagol ever done to him?

720
01:18:39,724 --> 01:18:42,097
Master?

721
01:18:42,894 --> 01:18:46,346
Master carries heavy burden.

722
01:18:46,523 --> 01:18:51,944
Sméagol knows.
Heavy, heavy burden.

723
01:18:52,112 --> 01:18:55,362
Fat one cannot know.

724
01:18:57,409 --> 01:19:00,160
Sméagol look after master.

725
01:19:01,371 --> 01:19:03,577
He wants it.

726
01:19:03,748 --> 01:19:08,291
He needs it.
Sméagol sees it in his eye.

727
01:19:08,461 --> 01:19:13,918
Very soon he will ask you for it.
You will see.

728
01:19:14,092 --> 01:19:17,959
The fat one will take it from you.

729
01:19:25,186 --> 01:19:29,516
Send forth all legions.

730
01:19:29,691 --> 01:19:33,736
Do not stop the attack
until the city is taken.

731
01:19:34,446 --> 01:19:37,565
Slay them all.

732
01:19:39,242 --> 01:19:45,031
- What of the wizard?
- I will break him.

733
01:19:48,376 --> 01:19:50,784
Where are Théoden's riders?

734
01:19:50,962 --> 01:19:53,536
Will Rohan's army come?

735
01:19:53,715 --> 01:19:55,957
Mithrandir.

736
01:19:57,010 --> 01:20:00,877
Courage is the best defense
that you have now.

737
01:20:05,685 --> 01:20:08,390
What were you thinking, Peregrin Took?

738
01:20:10,482 --> 01:20:16,187
What service can a Hobbit
offer such a great lord of Men?

739
01:20:16,363 --> 01:20:17,857
It was well done.

740
01:20:21,034 --> 01:20:25,079
A generous deed should not
be checked with cold counsel.

741
01:20:25,830 --> 01:20:28,368
You are to join the tower guard.

742
01:20:28,917 --> 01:20:31,918
I didn't think they would find any livery
that would fit me.

743
01:20:32,087 --> 01:20:34,542
Once belonged to a young boy
of the city.

744
01:20:34,714 --> 01:20:36,256
A very foolish one...

745
01:20:36,424 --> 01:20:40,671
...who wasted many hours slaying dragons
instead of attending to his studies.

746
01:20:40,845 --> 01:20:43,597
- This was yours?
- Yes, it was mine.

747
01:20:43,765 --> 01:20:45,556
My father had it made for me.

748
01:20:46,601 --> 01:20:47,929
Well...

749
01:20:48,103 --> 01:20:50,095
... I'm taller than you were then.

750
01:20:50,271 --> 01:20:53,605
Though I'm not likely to grow anymore,
except sideways.

751
01:20:56,569 --> 01:20:58,609
Never fitted me either.

752
01:20:58,780 --> 01:21:01,615
Boromir was always the soldier.

753
01:21:04,619 --> 01:21:07,027
They were so alike, he and my father.

754
01:21:09,124 --> 01:21:10,748
Proud.

755
01:21:10,917 --> 01:21:12,115
Stubborn even.

756
01:21:13,878 --> 01:21:15,372
But strong.

757
01:21:16,881 --> 01:21:20,048
I think you have strength
of a different kind.

758
01:21:20,677 --> 01:21:23,132
And one day your father will see it.

759
01:21:27,308 --> 01:21:31,092
Here do I swear fealty
and service to Gondor...

760
01:21:31,271 --> 01:21:32,765
...in peace or war...

761
01:21:33,398 --> 01:21:35,853
...in living or dying...

762
01:21:37,235 --> 01:21:38,480
...from...

763
01:21:41,155 --> 01:21:43,943
From this hour henceforth...

764
01:21:44,117 --> 01:21:46,026
...until my lord release me...

765
01:21:47,537 --> 01:21:49,743
...or death take me.

766
01:21:50,331 --> 01:21:52,822
And I shall not forget it...

767
01:21:53,001 --> 01:21:56,370
...nor fail to reward
that which is given.

768
01:22:03,970 --> 01:22:06,259
Fealty with love.

769
01:22:07,348 --> 01:22:09,008
Valour with honour.

770
01:22:10,602 --> 01:22:13,935
Disloyalty with vengeance.

771
01:22:22,572 --> 01:22:26,652
I do not think we should so lightly
abandon the outer defenses...

772
01:22:26,826 --> 01:22:29,578
...defenses that your brother
long held intact.

773
01:22:29,746 --> 01:22:32,237
- What would you have me do?
- I will not yield...

774
01:22:32,415 --> 01:22:35,202
...the river in Pelennor unfought.

775
01:22:35,376 --> 01:22:37,036
Osgiliath must be retaken.

776
01:22:37,211 --> 01:22:39,251
My lord, Osgiliath is overrun.

777
01:22:39,922 --> 01:22:42,710
Much must be risked in war.

778
01:22:45,345 --> 01:22:49,294
Is there a captain here who still has
the courage to do his lord's will?

779
01:22:55,521 --> 01:22:58,771
You wish now that our places
had been exchanged...

780
01:22:59,734 --> 01:23:02,569
...that I had died
and Boromir had lived.

781
01:23:05,990 --> 01:23:07,734
Yes.

782
01:23:08,409 --> 01:23:10,616
I wish that.

783
01:23:19,003 --> 01:23:21,494
Since you were robbed
of Boromir...

784
01:23:23,341 --> 01:23:26,258
... I will do what I can
in his stead.

785
01:23:34,435 --> 01:23:38,896
If I should return,
think better of me, Father.

786
01:23:40,983 --> 01:23:44,602
That will depend on the manner
of your return.

787
01:25:07,903 --> 01:25:10,229
What are you up to?

788
01:25:10,406 --> 01:25:11,651
Sneaking off, are we?

789
01:25:12,366 --> 01:25:14,193
Sneaking?

790
01:25:15,202 --> 01:25:17,361
Sneaking?

791
01:25:18,789 --> 01:25:21,956
Fat Hobbit is always so polite.

792
01:25:22,126 --> 01:25:27,203
Sméagol shows them secret ways
that nobody else could find...

793
01:25:27,381 --> 01:25:29,540
...and they say "sneak."

794
01:25:30,176 --> 01:25:32,749
Sneak?

795
01:25:33,387 --> 01:25:36,092
Very nice friend.
Oh, yes, my precious.

796
01:25:36,265 --> 01:25:38,886
- Very nice, very nice.
- All right. All right!

797
01:25:40,144 --> 01:25:42,350
You just startled me is all.

798
01:25:42,855 --> 01:25:44,682
What were you doing?

799
01:25:46,317 --> 01:25:48,440
Sneaking.

800
01:25:48,819 --> 01:25:51,904
Fine. Have it your own way.

801
01:25:54,158 --> 01:25:56,649
I'm sorry to wake you, Mr. Frodo.

802
01:25:57,036 --> 01:25:58,993
We have to be moving on.

803
01:26:04,168 --> 01:26:05,746
It's dark still.

804
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:08,126
It's always dark here.

805
01:26:12,384 --> 01:26:14,294
It's gone!

806
01:26:15,513 --> 01:26:18,383
- The Elven bread.
- What?

807
01:26:18,557 --> 01:26:20,016
That's all we have left.

808
01:26:24,105 --> 01:26:26,596
He took it. He must have!

809
01:26:27,108 --> 01:26:30,358
Sméagol?
No, no, not poor Sméagol.

810
01:26:30,528 --> 01:26:33,445
Sméagol hates nasty Elf bread.

811
01:26:33,614 --> 01:26:36,781
You're a lying rat!
What did you do with it?!

812
01:26:36,951 --> 01:26:38,493
He doesn't eat it.

813
01:26:39,495 --> 01:26:41,820
- He can't have taken it.
- Look.

814
01:26:42,873 --> 01:26:44,700
What's this?

815
01:26:47,378 --> 01:26:50,711
Crumbs on his jacketses.
He took it!

816
01:26:51,423 --> 01:26:53,083
He took it.

817
01:26:53,926 --> 01:26:58,137
I seen him. He's always stuffing
his face when master's not looking.

818
01:26:58,305 --> 01:27:00,097
That's a filthy lie!

819
01:27:00,266 --> 01:27:02,472
You stinking, two-faced sneak!

820
01:27:02,643 --> 01:27:03,888
- Sam!
- Call me--

821
01:27:04,061 --> 01:27:05,306
Stop it!

822
01:27:06,313 --> 01:27:07,511
Sam!

823
01:27:08,816 --> 01:27:12,434
- I'll kill him!
- Sam! No!

824
01:27:13,487 --> 01:27:19,027
Oh, my-- I'm sorry. I didn't mean it
to go so far. I was just so-- So angry.

825
01:27:19,201 --> 01:27:21,324
Here, just--
Let's just rest a bit.

826
01:27:21,495 --> 01:27:23,571
- I'm all right.
- No.

827
01:27:23,747 --> 01:27:26,832
No, you're not all right.
You're exhausted.

828
01:27:27,001 --> 01:27:29,124
It's that Gollum.

829
01:27:29,295 --> 01:27:31,003
It's this place.

830
01:27:31,171 --> 01:27:33,745
It's that thing around your neck.

831
01:27:37,261 --> 01:27:38,541
I could help a bit.

832
01:27:38,721 --> 01:27:41,390
I could carry it for a while.

833
01:27:41,557 --> 01:27:43,300
Carry it for a while.

834
01:27:43,475 --> 01:27:44,720
I could carry it... I could carry it.

835
01:27:45,352 --> 01:27:50,809
Share the load...Share the load...
the load...the load.

836
01:27:50,983 --> 01:27:52,181
Get away!

837
01:27:52,359 --> 01:27:53,937
I don't want to keep it.

838
01:27:57,531 --> 01:27:59,524
I just want to help.

839
01:28:01,577 --> 01:28:04,198
See? See?

840
01:28:04,371 --> 01:28:07,787
He wants it for himself.

841
01:28:07,958 --> 01:28:09,666
Shut up, you!

842
01:28:10,210 --> 01:28:12,037
Go away!
Get out of here!

843
01:28:12,212 --> 01:28:14,039
No, Sam.

844
01:28:14,214 --> 01:28:15,459
It's you.

845
01:28:19,678 --> 01:28:21,386
I'm sorry, Sam.

846
01:28:23,057 --> 01:28:24,432
But he's a liar.

847
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:27,269
He's poisoned you against me.

848
01:28:28,687 --> 01:28:30,596
You can't help me anymore.

849
01:28:32,566 --> 01:28:34,440
You don't mean that.

850
01:28:36,945 --> 01:28:38,737
Go home.

851
01:29:58,777 --> 01:30:00,568
Faramir!

852
01:30:00,737 --> 01:30:02,647
Faramir!

853
01:30:04,157 --> 01:30:06,197
Your father's will has turned
to madness.

854
01:30:07,369 --> 01:30:09,409
Do not throw away your life
so rashly.

855
01:30:10,163 --> 01:30:12,489
Where does my allegiance lie
if not here?

856
01:30:13,125 --> 01:30:16,042
This is the city of the Men of Nûmenor.

857
01:30:16,670 --> 01:30:19,457
I will gladly give my life
to defend her beauty...

858
01:30:19,631 --> 01:30:22,834
...her memory, her wisdom.

859
01:30:25,220 --> 01:30:28,636
Your father loves you, Faramir.

860
01:30:29,349 --> 01:30:32,350
He will remember it
before the end.

861
01:31:41,963 --> 01:31:43,506
Can you sing, Master Hobbit?

862
01:31:46,384 --> 01:31:47,879
Well...

863
01:31:48,428 --> 01:31:50,053
...yes.

864
01:31:50,764 --> 01:31:54,512
At least, well enough
for my own people.

865
01:31:56,144 --> 01:31:58,552
But we have no songs
for great halls...

866
01:31:59,606 --> 01:32:00,851
...and evil times.

867
01:32:01,691 --> 01:32:04,858
And why should your songs
be unfit for my halls?

868
01:32:07,656 --> 01:32:09,066
Come, sing me a song.

869
01:32:20,126 --> 01:32:23,460
<i># Home is behind</i>

870
01:32:23,630 --> 01:32:27,378
<i># The world ahead</i>

871
01:32:29,803 --> 01:32:35,639
<i># And there are many paths to tread</i>

872
01:32:37,435 --> 01:32:40,970
<i># Through shadow</i>

873
01:32:41,147 --> 01:32:45,311
<i># To the edge of night</i>

874
01:32:46,987 --> 01:32:52,064
<i># Until the stars are all alight</i>

875
01:32:55,078 --> 01:32:59,407
<i># Mist and shadow</i>

876
01:32:59,583 --> 01:33:03,876
<i># Cloud and shade</i>

877
01:33:06,256 --> 01:33:09,589
<i># All shall fade</i>

878
01:33:11,970 --> 01:33:15,968
<i># All shall</i>

879
01:33:21,730 --> 01:33:24,102
<i># Fade</i>

880
01:33:48,506 --> 01:33:51,958
March! March!

881
01:33:52,135 --> 01:33:57,342
March! March! March!

882
01:34:00,810 --> 01:34:03,136
Make way for the king.

883
01:34:04,647 --> 01:34:06,640
Make way.

884
01:34:09,110 --> 01:34:11,150
The king is here.

885
01:34:13,114 --> 01:34:14,739
My lord.

886
01:34:15,992 --> 01:34:17,949
Hail to you, sire.

887
01:34:18,411 --> 01:34:19,609
Grimbold, how many?

888
01:34:19,788 --> 01:34:22,243
I bring 500 men from the Westfold,
my lord.

889
01:34:23,208 --> 01:34:25,877
We have 300 more from Fenmarch,
Théoden King.

890
01:34:27,003 --> 01:34:30,953
- Where are the riders from Snowbourn?
- None have come, my lord.

891
01:34:48,024 --> 01:34:50,147
Six thousand spears.

892
01:34:51,194 --> 01:34:53,187
Less than half of what I'd hoped for.

893
01:34:53,488 --> 01:34:56,857
Six thousand will not be enough
to break the lines of Mordor.

894
01:34:59,619 --> 01:35:01,362
More will come.

895
01:35:01,746 --> 01:35:04,700
Every hour lost hastens Gondor's defeat.

896
01:35:04,874 --> 01:35:07,448
We have till dawn,
then we must ride.

897
01:35:26,938 --> 01:35:29,263
The horses are restless...

898
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:30,935
...and the men are quiet.

899
01:35:31,401 --> 01:35:34,520
They grow nervous in the shadow
of the mountain.

900
01:35:36,990 --> 01:35:38,863
That road there...

901
01:35:39,784 --> 01:35:41,860
...where does that lead?

902
01:35:42,620 --> 01:35:46,452
It is the road to the Dimholt,
the door under the mountain.

903
01:35:47,166 --> 01:35:50,167
None who venture there ever return.

904
01:35:51,379 --> 01:35:53,253
That mountain is evil.

905
01:36:16,195 --> 01:36:18,022
Aragorn.

906
01:36:18,781 --> 01:36:20,690
Let's find some food.

907
01:36:37,175 --> 01:36:38,585
There.

908
01:36:39,552 --> 01:36:42,553
A true esquire of Rohan.

909
01:36:46,184 --> 01:36:48,176
I'm ready.

910
01:36:49,771 --> 01:36:51,051
Sorry.

911
01:36:51,230 --> 01:36:53,472
It isn't all that dangerous.

912
01:36:53,983 --> 01:36:56,308
It's not even sharp.

913
01:36:56,986 --> 01:37:00,402
Well, that's no good. You won't kill
many Orcs with a blunt blade.

914
01:37:00,573 --> 01:37:02,067
Come on.

915
01:37:06,450 --> 01:37:08,940
To the smithy. Go!

916
01:37:10,412 --> 01:37:12,951
You should not encourage him.

917
01:37:13,124 --> 01:37:15,578
You should not doubt him.

918
01:37:15,750 --> 01:37:19,034
I do not doubt his heart,
only the reach of his arm.

919
01:37:21,755 --> 01:37:23,333
Why should Merry be left behind?

920
01:37:23,506 --> 01:37:26,128
He has as much cause
to go to war as you.

921
01:37:28,302 --> 01:37:31,470
Why can he not fight
for those he loves?

922
01:37:34,725 --> 01:37:37,725
You know as little of war
as that Hobbit.

923
01:37:38,979 --> 01:37:41,053
When the fear takes him...

924
01:37:41,230 --> 01:37:46,271
...and the blood and the screams
and the horror of battle take hold...

925
01:37:46,651 --> 01:37:48,811
...do you think he would stand and fight?

926
01:37:51,363 --> 01:37:52,989
He would flee.

927
01:37:53,158 --> 01:37:55,196
And he would be right to do so.

928
01:37:57,412 --> 01:38:01,360
War is the province of Men, Éowyn.

929
01:38:37,029 --> 01:38:40,731
I choose a mortal life.

930
01:38:43,661 --> 01:38:46,530
I wish I could've seen him...

931
01:38:47,664 --> 01:38:50,368
...one last time.

932
01:39:01,551 --> 01:39:02,963
Sir?

933
01:39:04,804 --> 01:39:07,378
King Théoden awaits you, my lord.

934
01:39:28,157 --> 01:39:30,116
I take my leave.

935
01:39:44,757 --> 01:39:46,000
My lord Elrond.

936
01:39:46,590 --> 01:39:50,088
I come on behalf of one whom I love.

937
01:39:53,180 --> 01:39:55,171
Arwen is dying.

938
01:39:59,977 --> 01:40:04,021
She will not long survive the evil
that now spreads from Mordor.

939
01:40:04,772 --> 01:40:08,143
The light of the Evenstar is failing.

940
01:40:08,319 --> 01:40:12,316
As Sauron's power grows,
her strength wanes.

941
01:40:12,489 --> 01:40:16,237
Arwen's life is now tied
to the fate of the Ring.

942
01:40:16,993 --> 01:40:19,565
The Shadow is upon us, Aragorn.

943
01:40:19,953 --> 01:40:21,614
The end has come.

944
01:40:21,998 --> 01:40:24,618
It will not be our end, but his.

945
01:40:25,375 --> 01:40:28,957
You ride to war, but not to victory.

946
01:40:29,962 --> 01:40:33,627
Sauron's armies march on Minas Tirith,
this you know.

947
01:40:33,799 --> 01:40:38,211
But in secret he sends another force
which will attack from the river.

948
01:40:38,678 --> 01:40:42,093
A fleet of Corsair ships sails
from the south.

949
01:40:42,724 --> 01:40:44,800
They'll be in the city in two days.

950
01:40:45,307 --> 01:40:48,144
You're outnumbered, Aragorn.

951
01:40:48,855 --> 01:40:50,976
You need more men.

952
01:40:51,356 --> 01:40:53,099
There are none.

953
01:40:54,858 --> 01:40:58,774
There are those who dwell
in the mountain.

954
01:41:07,787 --> 01:41:09,945
Murderers...

955
01:41:10,123 --> 01:41:11,533
...traitors.

956
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,160
You would call upon them to fight?

957
01:41:16,337 --> 01:41:17,913
They believe in nothing.

958
01:41:18,087 --> 01:41:20,211
They answer to no one.

959
01:41:20,381 --> 01:41:23,465
They will answer
to the king of Gondor.

960
01:41:30,599 --> 01:41:35,724
Andûril, the Flame of the West,
forged from the shards of Narsil.

961
01:41:50,031 --> 01:41:54,443
Sauron will not have forgotten
the Sword of Elendil.

962
01:42:08,506 --> 01:42:13,251
The blade that was broken
shall return to Minas Tirith.

963
01:42:13,427 --> 01:42:15,835
The man who can wield
the power of this sword...

964
01:42:16,014 --> 01:42:19,881
...can summon to him an army more
deadly than any that walks this earth.

965
01:42:21,728 --> 01:42:23,885
Put aside the Ranger.

966
01:42:24,062 --> 01:42:27,395
Become who you were born to be.

967
01:42:27,565 --> 01:42:29,558
Take the Dimholt road.

968
01:42:33,571 --> 01:42:36,357
I give hope to Men.

969
01:42:39,618 --> 01:42:43,746
I keep none for myself.

970
01:42:55,590 --> 01:42:57,250
Why are you doing this?

971
01:42:57,718 --> 01:43:00,920
The war lies to the east.
You cannot leave on the eve of battle.

972
01:43:03,348 --> 01:43:05,422
You cannot abandon the men.

973
01:43:06,725 --> 01:43:08,302
Éowyn...

974
01:43:08,476 --> 01:43:10,683
We need you here.

975
01:43:11,814 --> 01:43:13,685
Why have you come?

976
01:43:15,359 --> 01:43:17,316
Do you not know?

977
01:43:26,616 --> 01:43:29,618
It is but a shadow and a thought
that you love.

978
01:43:33,541 --> 01:43:35,946
I cannot give you what you seek.

979
01:43:49,472 --> 01:43:53,385
I have wished you joy
since first I saw you.

980
01:44:12,534 --> 01:44:14,821
Just where do you think
you're off to?

981
01:44:14,994 --> 01:44:16,322
Not this time.

982
01:44:16,495 --> 01:44:18,701
This time you must stay, Gimli.

983
01:44:21,417 --> 01:44:24,250
Have you learned nothing
of the stubbornness of Dwarves?

984
01:44:24,419 --> 01:44:28,083
You might as well accept it.
We're going with you, laddie.

985
01:44:50,400 --> 01:44:52,558
- What's happening?
- Where is he going?

986
01:44:52,902 --> 01:44:54,775
Where's he going?

987
01:44:57,365 --> 01:44:59,403
I don't understand.

988
01:45:03,827 --> 01:45:05,619
Lord Aragorn!

989
01:45:06,039 --> 01:45:08,743
Why does he leave on the eve of battle?

990
01:45:09,958 --> 01:45:12,035
He leaves because there is no hope.

991
01:45:12,710 --> 01:45:14,833
He leaves because he must.

992
01:45:15,004 --> 01:45:16,713
Too few have come.

993
01:45:16,882 --> 01:45:19,039
We cannot defeat
the armies of Mordor.

994
01:45:21,553 --> 01:45:23,212
No...

995
01:45:23,637 --> 01:45:24,882
...we cannot.

996
01:45:27,765 --> 01:45:31,549
But we will meet them
in battle nonetheless.

997
01:45:45,989 --> 01:45:47,733
I have left instruction.

998
01:45:50,409 --> 01:45:53,661
The people are to follow
your rule in my stead.

999
01:46:00,253 --> 01:46:02,495
Take up my seat in the Golden Hall.

1000
01:46:03,755 --> 01:46:06,591
Long may you defend Edoras...

1001
01:46:06,759 --> 01:46:09,082
...if the battle goes ill.

1002
01:46:10,178 --> 01:46:13,593
What other duty would you
have me do, my lord?

1003
01:46:15,808 --> 01:46:17,765
Duty?

1004
01:46:19,936 --> 01:46:21,266
No.

1005
01:46:29,571 --> 01:46:31,693
I would have you smile again...

1006
01:46:35,118 --> 01:46:40,109
...not grieve for those
whose time has come.

1007
01:46:44,957 --> 01:46:48,458
You shall live to see
these days renewed...

1008
01:46:52,799 --> 01:46:55,550
...and no more despair.

1009
01:47:01,766 --> 01:47:05,465
What kind of army would linger
in such a place?

1010
01:47:05,644 --> 01:47:07,471
One that is cursed.

1011
01:47:09,439 --> 01:47:11,977
Long ago, the Men of the Mountains
swore an oath...

1012
01:47:12,398 --> 01:47:15,151
...to the last king of Gondor...

1013
01:47:15,737 --> 01:47:17,312
...to come to his aid...

1014
01:47:17,486 --> 01:47:19,195
...to fight.

1015
01:47:19,698 --> 01:47:21,854
But when the time came...

1016
01:47:22,491 --> 01:47:25,113
...when Gondor's need was dire...

1017
01:47:25,286 --> 01:47:27,158
...they fled...

1018
01:47:27,329 --> 01:47:30,699
...vanishing into the darkness
of the mountain.

1019
01:47:31,749 --> 01:47:34,075
And so Isildur cursed them...

1020
01:47:35,627 --> 01:47:39,496
...never to rest until they had
fulfilled their pledge.

1021
01:47:43,802 --> 01:47:46,968
Who shall call them
from the grey twilight?

1022
01:47:47,430 --> 01:47:49,671
The forgotten people.

1023
01:47:49,848 --> 01:47:52,340
The heir of him to whom
the oath they swore.

1024
01:47:52,811 --> 01:47:54,683
From the north shall he come.

1025
01:47:55,187 --> 01:47:56,847
Need shall drive him.

1026
01:47:57,940 --> 01:48:01,438
He shall pass the door
to the Paths of the Dead.

1027
01:48:19,917 --> 01:48:23,202
The very warmth of my blood
seems stolen away.

1028
01:48:28,759 --> 01:48:30,713
The way is shut.

1029
01:48:31,469 --> 01:48:33,425
It was made by those
who are dead.

1030
01:48:34,055 --> 01:48:36,295
And the Dead keep it.

1031
01:48:36,848 --> 01:48:38,390
The way is shut.

1032
01:48:49,735 --> 01:48:51,229
Brego!

1033
01:48:54,738 --> 01:48:57,444
I do not fear death.

1034
01:49:09,752 --> 01:49:12,159
Well, this is a thing unheard-of.

1035
01:49:12,337 --> 01:49:16,998
An Elf will go underground
where a Dwarf dare not?

1036
01:49:17,175 --> 01:49:18,504
Oh.

1037
01:49:18,677 --> 01:49:21,510
Oh, I'd never hear the end of it.

1038
01:49:36,525 --> 01:49:38,769
We must ride light and swift.

1039
01:49:38,945 --> 01:49:40,688
It is a long road ahead.

1040
01:49:40,863 --> 01:49:43,948
And man and beast must reach the end
with the strength to fight.

1041
01:49:49,453 --> 01:49:52,456
Little Hobbits do not belong in war,
Master Meriadoc.

1042
01:49:52,791 --> 01:49:54,782
All my friends have gone to battle.

1043
01:49:54,958 --> 01:49:56,833
I would be ashamed to be left behind.

1044
01:49:57,003 --> 01:49:59,124
It is a three-day gallop to Minas Tirith.

1045
01:49:59,296 --> 01:50:01,668
And none of my riders can bear you
as a burden.

1046
01:50:02,676 --> 01:50:04,796
I want to fight.

1047
01:50:05,301 --> 01:50:07,295
I will say no more.

1048
01:50:24,110 --> 01:50:26,065
Ride with me.

1049
01:50:27,529 --> 01:50:28,940
My lady.

1050
01:50:29,115 --> 01:50:31,485
Form up! Move out!

1051
01:50:31,658 --> 01:50:34,861
Form up! Move out!

1052
01:50:37,955 --> 01:50:39,154
Ride!

1053
01:50:39,333 --> 01:50:42,286
Ride now to Gondor!

1054
01:51:23,912 --> 01:51:25,656
What is it?

1055
01:51:25,830 --> 01:51:27,372
What do you see?

1056
01:51:27,623 --> 01:51:29,747
I see shapes of men.

1057
01:51:32,419 --> 01:51:33,796
And of horses.

1058
01:51:34,547 --> 01:51:35,744
Where?

1059
01:51:35,921 --> 01:51:38,877
Pale banners like shreds of cloud.

1060
01:51:41,303 --> 01:51:43,509
Spears rise...

1061
01:51:44,140 --> 01:51:47,589
...like winter-thickets
through a shroud of mist.

1062
01:51:48,849 --> 01:51:51,008
The Dead are following.

1063
01:51:52,230 --> 01:51:53,722
They have been summoned.

1064
01:51:54,396 --> 01:51:56,224
The Dead?

1065
01:51:56,608 --> 01:51:58,314
Summoned?

1066
01:51:58,734 --> 01:52:00,608
I knew that.

1067
01:52:03,947 --> 01:52:05,690
Very good.

1068
01:52:06,408 --> 01:52:08,483
Very good! Legolas!

1069
01:52:46,443 --> 01:52:47,854
Do not look down.

1070
01:53:40,448 --> 01:53:45,573
Who enters my domain?

1071
01:53:49,331 --> 01:53:51,538
One who will have your allegiance.

1072
01:53:54,502 --> 01:53:59,841
The Dead do not suffer the living to pass.

1073
01:54:00,175 --> 01:54:02,843
You will suffer me.

1074
01:54:26,363 --> 01:54:29,734
The way is shut.

1075
01:54:30,909 --> 01:54:35,370
It was made by those who are dead.

1076
01:54:35,747 --> 01:54:39,910
And the Dead keep it.

1077
01:54:49,050 --> 01:54:52,136
The way is shut.

1078
01:54:53,888 --> 01:54:56,510
Now you must die.

1079
01:55:00,395 --> 01:55:03,227
I summon you to fulfill your oath.

1080
01:55:03,563 --> 01:55:08,521
None but the king of Gondor
may command me.

1081
01:55:14,115 --> 01:55:16,271
That line was broken.

1082
01:55:18,910 --> 01:55:21,115
It has been remade.

1083
01:55:29,044 --> 01:55:30,586
Fight for us...

1084
01:55:30,754 --> 01:55:33,293
...and regain your honour.

1085
01:55:37,469 --> 01:55:38,797
What say you?

1086
01:55:51,022 --> 01:55:52,565
What say you?

1087
01:55:53,315 --> 01:55:55,107
You waste your time, Aragorn.

1088
01:55:55,276 --> 01:55:58,442
They had no honour in life,
they have none now in death.

1089
01:55:58,945 --> 01:56:01,436
I am Isildur's heir.

1090
01:56:01,992 --> 01:56:03,947
Fight for me...

1091
01:56:04,534 --> 01:56:08,115
...and I will hold your oaths fulfilled.

1092
01:56:12,040 --> 01:56:13,998
What say you?

1093
01:56:21,924 --> 01:56:24,131
You have my word!

1094
01:56:24,427 --> 01:56:28,424
Fight, and I will release you
from this living death!

1095
01:56:29,888 --> 01:56:31,384
What say you?!

1096
01:56:34,685 --> 01:56:37,639
Stand, you traitors!

1097
01:57:04,587 --> 01:57:05,619
Out!

1098
01:57:26,981 --> 01:57:28,559
Legolas!

1099
01:57:29,694 --> 01:57:30,889
Run!

1100
01:58:37,209 --> 01:58:39,285
We fight.

1101
01:58:49,638 --> 01:58:52,211
Open the gate! Quick!

1102
01:59:23,250 --> 01:59:25,241
Quick! Hurry!

1103
01:59:39,013 --> 01:59:40,638
Faramir!

1104
01:59:41,641 --> 01:59:44,891
Say not that he has fallen.

1105
01:59:46,062 --> 01:59:47,605
They were outnumbered.

1106
01:59:48,021 --> 01:59:49,599
None survived.

1107
01:59:50,315 --> 01:59:52,309
Fear.

1108
01:59:52,858 --> 01:59:56,063
The city is rank with it.

1109
01:59:58,406 --> 02:00:00,861
Let us ease their pain.

1110
02:00:01,117 --> 02:00:02,859
Release the prisoners.

1111
02:00:03,035 --> 02:00:04,992
Catapults!

1112
02:00:18,341 --> 02:00:21,791
My sons are spent.

1113
02:00:22,844 --> 02:00:25,760
My line has ended.

1114
02:00:28,600 --> 02:00:30,009
He's alive!

1115
02:00:30,183 --> 02:00:33,351
The House of Stewards has failed.

1116
02:00:33,521 --> 02:00:34,978
He needs medicine, my lord.

1117
02:00:36,022 --> 02:00:38,690
My line has ended!

1118
02:00:40,193 --> 02:00:42,186
My lord!

1119
02:00:55,707 --> 02:00:57,532
Rohan...

1120
02:00:58,291 --> 02:01:00,701
...has deserted us.

1121
02:01:15,141 --> 02:01:18,343
Théoden's betrayed me.

1122
02:01:29,485 --> 02:01:31,312
Abandon your posts!

1123
02:01:32,363 --> 02:01:36,278
Flee! Flee for your lives!

1124
02:01:46,418 --> 02:01:47,959
Prepare for battle!

1125
02:01:48,503 --> 02:01:51,670
Hurry, men! To the wall! Defend the wall!

1126
02:01:52,839 --> 02:01:54,798
Over here!

1127
02:01:55,551 --> 02:01:57,921
Return to your posts!

1128
02:02:08,729 --> 02:02:11,349
Send these foul beasts into the abyss.

1129
02:02:21,532 --> 02:02:22,990
Stay where you are.

1130
02:02:39,965 --> 02:02:41,375
We need more rubble!

1131
02:02:41,549 --> 02:02:43,422
Watch out!

1132
02:02:43,592 --> 02:02:46,131
Down to the lower levels. Quick!

1133
02:02:48,012 --> 02:02:49,555
Double up, men!

1134
02:03:58,534 --> 02:04:01,533
Hold them back! Do not give in to fear.

1135
02:04:02,037 --> 02:04:05,537
Stand to your posts! Fight!

1136
02:04:46,202 --> 02:04:47,824
Not at the towers!

1137
02:04:47,993 --> 02:04:50,995
Aim for the trolls! Kill the trolls!

1138
02:04:51,748 --> 02:04:53,574
Bring them down!

1139
02:05:28,697 --> 02:05:30,736
Fight them back!

1140
02:05:30,906 --> 02:05:32,900
Peregrin Took!

1141
02:05:33,783 --> 02:05:36,952
- Go back to the Citadel!
- They'd called us out to fight.

1142
02:05:52,634 --> 02:05:55,006
This is no place for a Hobbit.

1143
02:06:20,742 --> 02:06:22,201
Guard of the Citadel, indeed.

1144
02:06:22,827 --> 02:06:26,160
Now, back, up the hill. Quickly. Quick!

1145
02:06:37,507 --> 02:06:40,461
What are you doing,
you useless scum?!

1146
02:06:40,635 --> 02:06:42,593
The door won't give. It's too strong.

1147
02:06:48,934 --> 02:06:51,341
Get back there and smash it down.

1148
02:06:51,520 --> 02:06:53,512
But nothing can breach it.

1149
02:06:56,442 --> 02:06:58,681
Grond will breach it.

1150
02:07:02,111 --> 02:07:04,188
Bring up the wolf's head.

1151
02:07:07,367 --> 02:07:12,705
Grond! Grond! Grond! Grond!

1152
02:07:13,038 --> 02:07:16,869
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1153
02:07:18,794 --> 02:07:22,210
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1154
02:07:22,923 --> 02:07:26,587
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1155
02:07:27,009 --> 02:07:31,172
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1156
02:07:31,346 --> 02:07:35,046
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1157
02:07:56,079 --> 02:07:57,871
You may go no further.

1158
02:08:01,085 --> 02:08:04,038
You will not enter Gondor.

1159
02:08:04,464 --> 02:08:06,790
Who are you to deny us passage?

1160
02:08:06,967 --> 02:08:10,716
Legolas, fire a warning shot
past the bosun's ear.

1161
02:08:12,972 --> 02:08:14,633
Mind your aim.

1162
02:08:21,356 --> 02:08:23,730
That's it. Right. We warned you.

1163
02:08:23,902 --> 02:08:26,108
Prepare to be boarded.

1164
02:08:27,490 --> 02:08:28,734
Boarded?

1165
02:08:28,907 --> 02:08:30,567
By you and whose army?

1166
02:08:32,119 --> 02:08:34,410
This army.

1167
02:08:51,099 --> 02:08:52,927
In there.

1168
02:08:54,603 --> 02:08:56,477
What is this place?

1169
02:09:00,902 --> 02:09:04,271
Master must go inside the tunnel.

1170
02:09:05,657 --> 02:09:09,656
Now that I'm here, I don't think I want to.

1171
02:09:11,749 --> 02:09:13,989
It's the only way.

1172
02:09:16,379 --> 02:09:18,370
Go in...

1173
02:09:18,923 --> 02:09:21,128
...or go back.

1174
02:09:23,802 --> 02:09:26,588
I can't go back.

1175
02:09:38,779 --> 02:09:41,482
- What's that smell?
- Orcses' filth.

1176
02:09:41,655 --> 02:09:44,906
Orcses come in here sometimes.

1177
02:09:49,873 --> 02:09:51,748
Hurry.

1178
02:09:56,632 --> 02:09:58,588
This way.

1179
02:10:01,429 --> 02:10:03,220
Sméagol?

1180
02:10:04,182 --> 02:10:06,340
Over here.

1181
02:10:14,651 --> 02:10:17,818
It's sticky. What is it?

1182
02:10:17,988 --> 02:10:20,279
You'll see.

1183
02:10:20,451 --> 02:10:22,775
Oh, yes.

1184
02:10:22,952 --> 02:10:26,119
You will see.

1185
02:10:35,006 --> 02:10:36,667
Sméagol?

1186
02:10:37,970 --> 02:10:39,252
Sméagol!

1187
02:10:41,974 --> 02:10:43,885
Sméagol!

1188
02:10:53,155 --> 02:10:55,110
Sam.

1189
02:12:35,184 --> 02:12:37,309
And you, Frodo Baggins...

1190
02:12:37,480 --> 02:12:42,854
...I give you the light of Eärendil,
our most beloved star.

1191
02:12:43,653 --> 02:12:46,939
May it be a light for you
in dark places...

1192
02:12:47,115 --> 02:12:50,947
...when all other lights go out.

1193
02:14:06,995 --> 02:14:10,284
Naughty little fly

1194
02:14:10,459 --> 02:14:13,663
Why does he cry?

1195
02:14:14,213 --> 02:14:17,547
Caught in a web

1196
02:14:17,717 --> 02:14:20,471
Soon you'll be...

1197
02:14:20,845 --> 02:14:22,673
Eaten.

1198
02:14:59,848 --> 02:15:02,553
Got away, did it, precious?

1199
02:15:02,726 --> 02:15:04,850
Not this time.

1200
02:15:05,021 --> 02:15:08,105
- Not this time!
- No!

1201
02:15:14,949 --> 02:15:18,283
It wasn't us. It wasn't us!

1202
02:15:18,744 --> 02:15:21,367
Sméagol wouldn't hurt master.

1203
02:15:21,539 --> 02:15:23,448
We promised.

1204
02:15:23,625 --> 02:15:26,115
You must believe us.

1205
02:15:26,294 --> 02:15:28,003
It was the precious.

1206
02:15:28,172 --> 02:15:32,966
The precious made us do it.

1207
02:15:50,071 --> 02:15:52,989
I have to destroy it, Sméagol.

1208
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:05,337
I have to destroy it for both our sakes.

1209
02:16:15,518 --> 02:16:16,844
No!

1210
02:16:40,085 --> 02:16:42,495
I'm so sorry, Sam.

1211
02:16:46,970 --> 02:16:49,543
I'm so sorry.

1212
02:17:15,293 --> 02:17:20,121
This task was appointed to you,
Frodo of the Shire.

1213
02:17:21,256 --> 02:17:23,666
If you do not find a way...

1214
02:17:24,927 --> 02:17:26,173
...no one will.

1215
02:18:00,009 --> 02:18:02,761
The scouts report
Minas Tirith is surrounded.

1216
02:18:02,929 --> 02:18:05,219
The lower level's in flames.

1217
02:18:05,683 --> 02:18:08,139
Everywhere,
legions of the enemy advance.

1218
02:18:08,310 --> 02:18:09,509
Time is against us.

1219
02:18:10,105 --> 02:18:11,433
Make ready!

1220
02:18:11,606 --> 02:18:13,433
Take heart, Merry.

1221
02:18:13,608 --> 02:18:15,814
It will soon be over.

1222
02:18:16,403 --> 02:18:17,981
My lady...

1223
02:18:18,573 --> 02:18:21,144
...you are fair and brave...

1224
02:18:21,491 --> 02:18:23,900
...and have much to live for...

1225
02:18:25,245 --> 02:18:27,654
...and many who love you.

1226
02:18:30,418 --> 02:18:33,171
I know it is too late to turn aside.

1227
02:18:33,715 --> 02:18:36,918
I know there is not much point
now in hoping.

1228
02:18:38,137 --> 02:18:41,552
If I were a knight of Rohan,
capable of great deeds...

1229
02:18:41,723 --> 02:18:44,843
But I'm not.

1230
02:18:45,019 --> 02:18:46,847
I'm a Hobbit.

1231
02:18:49,565 --> 02:18:52,058
And I know I can't save Middle-earth.

1232
02:18:55,448 --> 02:18:57,771
I just want to help my friends.

1233
02:18:59,869 --> 02:19:01,364
Frodo.

1234
02:19:02,163 --> 02:19:03,955
Sam.

1235
02:19:05,541 --> 02:19:07,581
Pippin.

1236
02:19:09,004 --> 02:19:12,088
More than anything,
I wish I could see them again.

1237
02:19:16,303 --> 02:19:18,630
Prepare to move out!

1238
02:19:18,807 --> 02:19:21,594
Make haste.
We ride through the night.

1239
02:19:38,245 --> 02:19:39,573
To battle.

1240
02:19:39,997 --> 02:19:41,491
To battle.

1241
02:20:04,525 --> 02:20:06,315
Back to the gate!

1242
02:20:06,610 --> 02:20:08,770
Hurry!

1243
02:20:28,677 --> 02:20:33,175
I am steward of the House of Anárion.

1244
02:20:33,350 --> 02:20:35,721
Thus have I walked.

1245
02:20:36,937 --> 02:20:40,021
And thus now will I sleep.

1246
02:20:46,071 --> 02:20:48,195
Gondor is lost.

1247
02:20:48,657 --> 02:20:52,111
There is no hope for Men.

1248
02:21:06,719 --> 02:21:09,557
Why do the fools fly?

1249
02:21:11,100 --> 02:21:14,185
Better to die sooner than late.

1250
02:21:16,313 --> 02:21:18,390
For die we must.

1251
02:21:30,537 --> 02:21:33,576
No tomb for Denethor
and Faramir.

1252
02:21:34,709 --> 02:21:40,714
No long, slow sleep of death embalmed.

1253
02:21:40,884 --> 02:21:46,045
We shall burn,
like the heathen kings of old.

1254
02:21:49,727 --> 02:21:51,555
Bring wood and oil.

1255
02:21:54,315 --> 02:21:55,727
Steady.

1256
02:21:55,901 --> 02:21:57,939
Steady.

1257
02:22:12,336 --> 02:22:14,910
You are soldiers of Gondor.

1258
02:22:15,132 --> 02:22:19,593
No matter what comes through that gate,
you will stand your ground.

1259
02:22:26,060 --> 02:22:27,223
Run!

1260
02:22:29,146 --> 02:22:30,640
Volley!

1261
02:22:31,398 --> 02:22:33,274
Fire!

1262
02:24:26,445 --> 02:24:28,486
Let him go, you filth.

1263
02:24:30,408 --> 02:24:32,068
Let him go!

1264
02:24:33,330 --> 02:24:35,486
You will not touch him again.

1265
02:24:38,625 --> 02:24:40,501
Come on and finish it.

1266
02:26:30,252 --> 02:26:31,876
Back!

1267
02:26:42,681 --> 02:26:43,963
Mr. Frodo.

1268
02:26:53,528 --> 02:26:55,521
Oh, no.

1269
02:26:55,697 --> 02:26:57,654
Frodo.

1270
02:26:57,949 --> 02:26:59,824
Mr. Frodo.

1271
02:27:04,415 --> 02:27:05,743
Wake up.

1272
02:27:09,589 --> 02:27:11,960
Don't leave me here alone.

1273
02:27:13,468 --> 02:27:15,921
Don't go where I can't follow.

1274
02:27:20,224 --> 02:27:21,600
Wake up.

1275
02:27:28,276 --> 02:27:30,481
Not asleep.

1276
02:27:32,614 --> 02:27:34,523
Dead.

1277
02:27:53,303 --> 02:27:54,798
You get back, you scum!

1278
02:28:04,400 --> 02:28:05,727
What's this?

1279
02:28:06,901 --> 02:28:09,655
Looks like old Shelob's
been having a bit of fun.

1280
02:28:11,658 --> 02:28:14,149
Killed another one, has she?

1281
02:28:14,370 --> 02:28:16,326
No.

1282
02:28:19,042 --> 02:28:21,033
This fellow ain't dead.

1283
02:28:21,376 --> 02:28:23,667
Not dead?

1284
02:28:23,839 --> 02:28:29,628
She jabs him with her stinger,
and he goes as limp as a boned fish.

1285
02:28:29,970 --> 02:28:32,723
Then she has her way with them.

1286
02:28:33,058 --> 02:28:34,765
That's how she likes to feed.

1287
02:28:35,267 --> 02:28:37,391
Fresh blood.

1288
02:28:37,563 --> 02:28:39,887
Get him to the tower!

1289
02:28:43,358 --> 02:28:45,068
Samwise, you fool.

1290
02:28:45,236 --> 02:28:48,072
This scum will be awake
in a couple of hours.

1291
02:28:48,240 --> 02:28:50,732
Then he'll wish he'd never been born.

1292
02:29:15,020 --> 02:29:18,272
The house of his spirit crumbles.

1293
02:29:19,315 --> 02:29:20,776
He is burning.

1294
02:29:21,903 --> 02:29:23,232
Already burning.

1295
02:29:23,615 --> 02:29:25,606
He's not dead.

1296
02:29:26,075 --> 02:29:27,736
He's not dead!

1297
02:29:29,954 --> 02:29:31,746
No! No!

1298
02:29:31,916 --> 02:29:34,239
No! No!

1299
02:29:34,418 --> 02:29:36,411
He's not dead!

1300
02:29:36,795 --> 02:29:40,247
- Farewell, Peregrin, son of Paladin.
- No! No! No!

1301
02:29:40,425 --> 02:29:43,758
I release you from my service.

1302
02:29:45,095 --> 02:29:49,426
Go now and die in what way
seems best to you.

1303
02:29:51,602 --> 02:29:53,929
Pour oil on the wood!

1304
02:29:55,650 --> 02:29:57,689
Come on, soldier! Move it!

1305
02:29:58,194 --> 02:30:01,111
- Hurry along there! Hurry along!
- Gandalf!

1306
02:30:01,489 --> 02:30:02,948
Where is Gandalf?

1307
02:30:04,077 --> 02:30:05,450
Gandalf!

1308
02:30:10,792 --> 02:30:11,954
Retreat!

1309
02:30:14,129 --> 02:30:15,872
The city is breached!

1310
02:30:16,048 --> 02:30:19,004
Fall back to the second level!

1311
02:30:22,807 --> 02:30:24,382
Get the women and children out!

1312
02:30:24,764 --> 02:30:26,511
Get them out!

1313
02:30:26,685 --> 02:30:28,180
Retreat!

1314
02:30:28,354 --> 02:30:30,145
Come on. Come on.

1315
02:30:30,481 --> 02:30:34,729
Move into the city. Kill all in your path.

1316
02:30:42,744 --> 02:30:45,152
Take them down!

1317
02:31:05,686 --> 02:31:08,558
Fight. Fight to the last man!

1318
02:31:08,732 --> 02:31:10,011
Fight for your lives!

1319
02:31:10,191 --> 02:31:11,437
Gandalf!

1320
02:31:15,823 --> 02:31:17,200
Gandalf!

1321
02:31:17,367 --> 02:31:19,941
Denethor has lost his mind!

1322
02:31:20,120 --> 02:31:22,409
He's burning Faramir alive!

1323
02:31:22,581 --> 02:31:24,373
Up! Quickly!

1324
02:31:31,216 --> 02:31:32,711
Go back to the abyss.

1325
02:31:34,218 --> 02:31:37,387
Fall into the nothingness
that awaits you and your master.

1326
02:31:37,554 --> 02:31:44,058
Do you not know death when you see it,
old man?

1327
02:31:44,230 --> 02:31:48,893
This is my hour.

1328
02:31:58,455 --> 02:32:00,034
Gandalf!

1329
02:32:08,925 --> 02:32:12,461
You have failed.

1330
02:32:13,264 --> 02:32:18,092
The world of Men will fall.

1331
02:33:15,374 --> 02:33:16,835
Courage, Merry.

1332
02:33:17,003 --> 02:33:19,373
Courage for our friends.

1333
02:33:22,925 --> 02:33:26,010
Form ranks, you maggots. Form ranks!

1334
02:33:26,179 --> 02:33:29,429
Pikes in front. Archers behind.

1335
02:33:37,523 --> 02:33:40,692
Éomer, take your éored
down the left flank.

1336
02:33:40,863 --> 02:33:42,106
Flank ready.

1337
02:33:42,279 --> 02:33:45,152
Gamling, follow the king's banner
down the center.

1338
02:33:45,326 --> 02:33:49,027
Grimbold, take your company right
after you pass the wall.

1339
02:33:49,206 --> 02:33:51,956
Forth, and fear no darkness!

1340
02:33:52,124 --> 02:33:55,956
Arise, arise, Riders of Théoden!

1341
02:33:56,213 --> 02:34:01,373
Spears shall be shaken,
shields shall be splintered...

1342
02:34:01,593 --> 02:34:05,294
...a sword-day, a red day...

1343
02:34:05,472 --> 02:34:09,057
...ere the sun rises!

1344
02:34:16,820 --> 02:34:21,149
Whatever happens, stay with me.
I'll look after you.

1345
02:34:27,498 --> 02:34:29,574
Ride now!

1346
02:34:31,085 --> 02:34:33,208
Ride now!

1347
02:34:33,796 --> 02:34:36,585
Ride! Ride for ruin...

1348
02:34:36,760 --> 02:34:39,509
...and the world's ending!

1349
02:34:41,431 --> 02:34:42,840
Death!

1350
02:34:43,264 --> 02:34:46,184
Death!

1351
02:34:46,353 --> 02:34:49,603
- Death!
- Death!

1352
02:34:50,024 --> 02:34:51,600
- Death!
- Death!

1353
02:34:52,317 --> 02:34:55,768
- Death!
- Death!

1354
02:35:00,868 --> 02:35:03,276
Forth Eorlingas!

1355
02:35:46,255 --> 02:35:47,996
Fire!

1356
02:35:51,800 --> 02:35:53,000
Death!

1357
02:35:57,224 --> 02:35:58,504
Charge!

1358
02:35:58,976 --> 02:36:00,554
Fire at will!

1359
02:36:57,918 --> 02:37:01,203
Set a fire in our flesh.

1360
02:37:18,856 --> 02:37:20,601
Stay this madness!

1361
02:37:24,949 --> 02:37:29,527
You may triumph in the field of battle
for a day...

1362
02:37:30,120 --> 02:37:33,703
...but against the power that has risen
in the east...

1363
02:37:33,874 --> 02:37:37,124
...there is no victory.

1364
02:38:06,328 --> 02:38:08,072
No!

1365
02:38:08,248 --> 02:38:10,917
You will not take my son from me!

1366
02:38:11,083 --> 02:38:13,410
No! No!

1367
02:38:24,347 --> 02:38:26,009
Faramir.

1368
02:38:39,575 --> 02:38:43,524
So passes Denethor, son of Ecthelion.

1369
02:39:11,067 --> 02:39:12,859
Drive them to the river!

1370
02:39:15,613 --> 02:39:17,608
Make safe the city!

1371
02:39:57,620 --> 02:39:59,579
Re-form the line!

1372
02:40:00,707 --> 02:40:02,664
Re-form the line!

1373
02:40:09,674 --> 02:40:12,297
Sound the charge! Take them head-on!

1374
02:40:12,929 --> 02:40:15,088
Charge!

1375
02:41:34,062 --> 02:41:35,439
Cut him down!

1376
02:42:02,135 --> 02:42:04,756
Take the reins. Pull him left!

1377
02:42:07,142 --> 02:42:08,423
Left!

1378
02:42:25,829 --> 02:42:27,488
Aim for their heads!

1379
02:42:33,504 --> 02:42:36,789
Bring it down! Bring it down!
Bring it down!

1380
02:42:50,647 --> 02:42:52,143
Merry!

1381
02:44:05,566 --> 02:44:07,607
I didn't think it would end this way.

1382
02:44:08,902 --> 02:44:10,314
End?

1383
02:44:11,573 --> 02:44:13,695
No, the journey doesn't end here.

1384
02:44:16,203 --> 02:44:19,323
Death is just another path...

1385
02:44:19,915 --> 02:44:21,577
...one that we all must take.

1386
02:44:22,834 --> 02:44:26,288
The grey rain curtain
of this world rolls back...

1387
02:44:26,465 --> 02:44:30,083
...and all turns to silver glass.

1388
02:44:32,263 --> 02:44:34,220
And then you see it.

1389
02:44:36,144 --> 02:44:38,514
What, Gandalf?

1390
02:44:39,648 --> 02:44:40,974
See what?

1391
02:44:42,231 --> 02:44:44,440
White shores...

1392
02:44:46,111 --> 02:44:48,520
...and beyond.

1393
02:44:49,992 --> 02:44:51,783
A far green country...

1394
02:44:52,494 --> 02:44:55,411
...under a swift sunrise.

1395
02:44:59,458 --> 02:45:00,954
Well...

1396
02:45:01,129 --> 02:45:02,789
...that isn't so bad.

1397
02:45:02,965 --> 02:45:04,374
No.

1398
02:45:06,427 --> 02:45:08,087
No, it isn't.

1399
02:45:24,489 --> 02:45:27,823
Rally to me! To me!

1400
02:45:48,600 --> 02:45:53,143
Feast on his flesh.

1401
02:45:57,484 --> 02:45:59,856
I will kill you if you touch him.

1402
02:46:00,029 --> 02:46:05,486
Do not come between
the Nazgûl and his prey.

1403
02:47:13,903 --> 02:47:17,108
Late as usual, pirate scum!

1404
02:47:17,534 --> 02:47:19,774
There's knife-work here needs doing.

1405
02:47:19,952 --> 02:47:23,156
Come on, you sea rats!
Get off your ships!

1406
02:47:38,640 --> 02:47:40,762
There's plenty for the both of us.

1407
02:47:40,933 --> 02:47:43,010
May the best Dwarf win.

1408
02:48:00,497 --> 02:48:02,705
You fool.

1409
02:48:02,875 --> 02:48:06,292
No man can kill me.

1410
02:48:08,672 --> 02:48:11,841
Die now.

1411
02:48:22,522 --> 02:48:24,515
I am no man.

1412
02:48:41,043 --> 02:48:44,543
- Fifteen! Sixteen!
- Seventeen!

1413
02:48:52,348 --> 02:48:54,259
Merry!

1414
02:49:36,271 --> 02:49:38,064
Legolas!

1415
02:50:00,466 --> 02:50:02,839
Thirty-three, thirty-four.

1416
02:50:49,938 --> 02:50:52,311
That still only counts as one!

1417
02:50:52,483 --> 02:50:54,642
Come on, then. Come on!

1418
02:51:38,369 --> 02:51:41,204
I know your face...

1419
02:51:43,083 --> 02:51:44,911
...Éowyn.

1420
02:51:47,504 --> 02:51:49,875
My eyes darken.

1421
02:51:51,007 --> 02:51:52,383
No.

1422
02:51:53,219 --> 02:51:54,843
No.

1423
02:51:56,932 --> 02:51:59,422
I am going to save you.

1424
02:52:00,768 --> 02:52:03,096
You already did.

1425
02:52:06,777 --> 02:52:08,399
Éowyn...

1426
02:52:09,902 --> 02:52:12,396
...my body is broken.

1427
02:52:17,453 --> 02:52:19,910
You have to let me go.

1428
02:52:25,797 --> 02:52:28,370
I go to my fathers...

1429
02:52:29,843 --> 02:52:32,679
...in whose mighty company...

1430
02:52:33,138 --> 02:52:36,472
... I shall not now feel ashamed.

1431
02:52:53,078 --> 02:52:54,702
Éowyn.

1432
02:53:41,215 --> 02:53:43,672
Release us.

1433
02:53:45,595 --> 02:53:47,304
Bad idea.

1434
02:53:47,473 --> 02:53:51,304
Very handy in a tight spot, these lads,
despite the fact they're dead.

1435
02:53:51,476 --> 02:53:53,470
You gave us your word.

1436
02:53:55,230 --> 02:53:57,355
I hold your oath fulfilled.

1437
02:53:58,691 --> 02:54:00,022
Go.

1438
02:54:00,904 --> 02:54:02,564
Be at peace.

1439
02:54:45,940 --> 02:54:47,849
Merry.

1440
02:54:48,443 --> 02:54:51,647
No!

1441
02:54:55,573 --> 02:54:57,982
No!

1442
02:55:21,767 --> 02:55:25,633
<i># With a sigh</i>

1443
02:55:25,811 --> 02:55:29,511
<i># You turn away</i>

1444
02:55:29,691 --> 02:55:33,687
<i># With a deepening heart</i>

1445
02:55:33,861 --> 02:55:38,605
<i># No more words to say</i>

1446
02:55:38,781 --> 02:55:42,364
<i># You will find</i>

1447
02:55:42,536 --> 02:55:46,532
<i># That the world has changed</i>

1448
02:55:46,706 --> 02:55:50,833
<i># Forever</i>

1449
02:56:15,525 --> 02:56:23,319
<i># And the trees are now
Turning from green to gold</i>

1450
02:56:27,202 --> 02:56:32,541
<i># And the sun is now fading</i>

1451
02:56:32,708 --> 02:56:42,176
<i># I wish I could hold you closer</i>

1452
02:56:45,094 --> 02:56:46,291
Merry!

1453
02:56:47,889 --> 02:56:49,928
Merry!

1454
02:57:01,278 --> 02:57:03,104
Merry.

1455
02:57:05,573 --> 02:57:06,817
Merry, it's me.

1456
02:57:09,451 --> 02:57:10,992
It's Pippin.

1457
02:57:13,496 --> 02:57:15,785
I knew you'd find me.

1458
02:57:15,958 --> 02:57:17,154
Yes.

1459
02:57:19,585 --> 02:57:21,661
Are you going to leave me?

1460
02:57:22,213 --> 02:57:23,920
No, Merry.

1461
02:57:25,217 --> 02:57:27,457
I'm going to look after you.

1462
02:58:11,467 --> 02:58:12,880
Hands off!

1463
02:58:13,053 --> 02:58:16,219
That shiny shirt, that's mine.

1464
02:58:16,473 --> 02:58:20,637
It's going to the Great Eye,
along with everything else.

1465
02:58:22,188 --> 02:58:26,018
I don't take orders from
stinking Morgul-rats!

1466
02:58:26,858 --> 02:58:32,018
You touch it, and I'll stick
this blade in your gut.

1467
02:58:52,716 --> 02:58:54,506
The scum tried to knife me.

1468
02:58:54,676 --> 02:58:56,419
Kill him!

1469
03:00:39,651 --> 03:00:41,643
That's for Frodo!

1470
03:00:42,028 --> 03:00:44,150
And for the Shire!

1471
03:00:47,741 --> 03:00:49,865
And that's for my old Gaffer!

1472
03:01:19,355 --> 03:01:22,689
Stop your squealing, you dunghill rat.

1473
03:01:23,817 --> 03:01:28,527
I'm gonna bleed you like a stuck pig.

1474
03:01:35,870 --> 03:01:37,530
Not if I stick you first.

1475
03:01:37,705 --> 03:01:39,248
Sam!

1476
03:01:44,296 --> 03:01:46,334
Oh, Sam, I'm so sorry.

1477
03:01:46,505 --> 03:01:48,546
Sorry for everything.

1478
03:01:49,049 --> 03:01:52,715
- Let's get you out of here.
- It's too late. It's over.

1479
03:01:52,888 --> 03:01:55,756
They've taken it. Sam...

1480
03:01:56,556 --> 03:01:58,052
...they took the Ring.

1481
03:01:58,809 --> 03:02:01,515
Begging your pardon, but they haven't.

1482
03:02:13,490 --> 03:02:15,695
I thought I'd lost you.

1483
03:02:16,076 --> 03:02:17,783
So I took it.

1484
03:02:18,952 --> 03:02:21,028
Only for safekeeping.

1485
03:02:22,290 --> 03:02:24,034
Give it to me.

1486
03:02:27,586 --> 03:02:29,792
Give me the Ring, Sam.

1487
03:02:34,468 --> 03:02:35,712
Sam.

1488
03:02:37,304 --> 03:02:39,262
Give me the Ring.

1489
03:02:59,992 --> 03:03:01,272
You must understand.

1490
03:03:04,787 --> 03:03:06,615
The Ring is my burden.

1491
03:03:07,792 --> 03:03:09,949
It will destroy you, Sam.

1492
03:03:13,130 --> 03:03:15,086
Come on, Mr. Frodo.

1493
03:03:16,425 --> 03:03:18,049
We best find you some clothes.

1494
03:03:18,217 --> 03:03:21,253
You can't go walking through Mordor
in naught but your skin.

1495
03:03:42,991 --> 03:03:45,198
We did it, Mr. Frodo.

1496
03:03:45,703 --> 03:03:47,989
We made it to Mordor.

1497
03:03:49,331 --> 03:03:50,991
There are so many of them.

1498
03:03:51,959 --> 03:03:54,532
We'll never get through unseen.

1499
03:03:59,674 --> 03:04:03,007
It's him, the Eye.

1500
03:04:10,727 --> 03:04:13,347
We have to go in there, Mr. Frodo.

1501
03:04:13,811 --> 03:04:15,851
There's nothing for it.

1502
03:04:18,858 --> 03:04:23,270
Come on. Let's just make it
down the hill for starters.

1503
03:04:32,622 --> 03:04:35,871
Frodo has passed beyond my sight.

1504
03:04:37,208 --> 03:04:40,045
The darkness is deepening.

1505
03:04:40,212 --> 03:04:42,583
If Sauron had the Ring,
we would know it.

1506
03:04:42,757 --> 03:04:44,795
It's only a matter of time.

1507
03:04:46,302 --> 03:04:48,709
He has suffered a defeat, yes...

1508
03:04:49,763 --> 03:04:54,258
...but behind the walls of Mordor,
our enemy is regrouping.

1509
03:04:54,433 --> 03:04:56,260
Let him stay there.

1510
03:04:56,436 --> 03:04:59,106
Let him rot! Why should we care?

1511
03:04:59,273 --> 03:05:04,433
Because 10,000 Orcs now stand
between Frodo and Mount Doom.

1512
03:05:11,200 --> 03:05:13,691
I've sent him to his death.

1513
03:05:15,244 --> 03:05:16,527
No.

1514
03:05:17,038 --> 03:05:19,445
There is still hope for Frodo.

1515
03:05:19,792 --> 03:05:23,918
He needs time and safe passage
across the plains of Gorgoroth.

1516
03:05:25,005 --> 03:05:27,578
- We can give him that.
- How?

1517
03:05:27,924 --> 03:05:30,628
Draw out Sauron's armies.

1518
03:05:30,801 --> 03:05:32,925
Empty his lands.

1519
03:05:33,137 --> 03:05:36,221
Then we gather our full strength
and march on the Black Gate.

1520
03:05:36,849 --> 03:05:39,850
We cannot achieve victory
through strength of arms.

1521
03:05:40,018 --> 03:05:41,597
Not for ourselves.

1522
03:05:41,812 --> 03:05:47,400
But we can give Frodo his chance
if we keep Sauron's Eye fixed upon us.

1523
03:05:49,194 --> 03:05:52,977
Keep him blind to all else that moves.

1524
03:05:53,740 --> 03:05:54,937
A diversion.

1525
03:05:55,117 --> 03:05:56,907
Certainty of death...

1526
03:05:57,077 --> 03:05:59,829
...small chance of success...

1527
03:06:00,705 --> 03:06:02,283
...what are we waiting for?

1528
03:06:02,875 --> 03:06:05,281
Sauron will suspect a trap.

1529
03:06:06,084 --> 03:06:08,125
He will not take the bait.

1530
03:06:09,630 --> 03:06:12,120
Oh, I think he will.

1531
03:06:46,539 --> 03:06:49,160
Long have you hunted me.

1532
03:06:50,042 --> 03:06:51,325
Long have I eluded you.

1533
03:06:53,172 --> 03:06:54,750
No more.

1534
03:06:56,467 --> 03:06:58,873
Behold the Sword of Elendil.

1535
03:07:43,385 --> 03:07:45,877
The city has fallen silent.

1536
03:07:47,557 --> 03:07:50,592
There is no warmth left in the sun.

1537
03:07:51,393 --> 03:07:53,102
It grows so cold.

1538
03:07:56,107 --> 03:07:59,142
It's just the damp
of the first spring rain.

1539
03:08:05,533 --> 03:08:08,734
I do not believe this darkness
will endure.

1540
03:08:37,395 --> 03:08:38,937
Look, the Orcs...

1541
03:08:39,481 --> 03:08:41,473
...they're moving off.

1542
03:08:42,526 --> 03:08:44,602
You see, Mr. Frodo...

1543
03:08:44,777 --> 03:08:47,103
...some luck at last.

1544
03:08:47,279 --> 03:08:49,106
Move it, you slugs!

1545
03:08:50,408 --> 03:08:53,777
Come on! Faster!

1546
03:09:01,794 --> 03:09:05,044
Come along, you scum...

1547
03:09:05,214 --> 03:09:09,461
I'll whip you down to the bone, you...

1548
03:09:12,344 --> 03:09:13,970
Come on!

1549
03:09:14,138 --> 03:09:16,464
What have I told you?!

1550
03:09:23,315 --> 03:09:24,809
Get up!

1551
03:09:25,191 --> 03:09:27,860
Come on, you slugs!

1552
03:09:28,027 --> 03:09:31,644
You two are going straight
to the front line!

1553
03:09:31,823 --> 03:09:36,733
Now, move it! Go on!
Fall in! Move it!

1554
03:09:49,713 --> 03:09:53,546
To the Gate, you slugs!
Now, move it!

1555
03:10:02,935 --> 03:10:06,518
Don't you know we're at war?

1556
03:10:28,835 --> 03:10:31,705
Company, halt!

1557
03:10:35,550 --> 03:10:38,917
Inspection!

1558
03:10:39,095 --> 03:10:41,549
Sam, help me.

1559
03:10:41,721 --> 03:10:43,549
Mr. Frodo!

1560
03:10:46,268 --> 03:10:48,806
Stand up, Mr. Frodo.
Stand up!

1561
03:10:48,978 --> 03:10:50,804
It's so heavy.

1562
03:10:59,948 --> 03:11:01,109
Oh, no.

1563
03:11:06,746 --> 03:11:08,737
What do I do?
What do we do?

1564
03:11:11,792 --> 03:11:12,954
- Hit me.
- What?

1565
03:11:13,126 --> 03:11:15,165
Hit me, Sam. Start fighting.

1566
03:11:15,338 --> 03:11:16,913
Get off of me!

1567
03:11:17,588 --> 03:11:19,914
Nobody pushes me, you filthy maggot.

1568
03:11:28,558 --> 03:11:30,597
Get off of me!

1569
03:11:31,518 --> 03:11:33,428
Break it up! Break it up!

1570
03:11:35,982 --> 03:11:40,525
Oi! I'll have your guts if you don't
shut this rabble down!

1571
03:11:40,736 --> 03:11:43,062
Go, Sam. Now!

1572
03:11:51,995 --> 03:11:53,539
Move along, scum!

1573
03:11:53,706 --> 03:11:55,615
Back in the line!

1574
03:11:56,125 --> 03:11:57,917
You maggots!

1575
03:11:58,588 --> 03:12:01,586
Get back into the line,
you slugs!

1576
03:12:04,007 --> 03:12:07,459
Dig it, you slugs. Move it.

1577
03:12:10,180 --> 03:12:12,137
Move it!

1578
03:12:56,266 --> 03:12:58,305
I can't...

1579
03:12:58,476 --> 03:13:02,226
I can't...
I can't manage the Ring, Sam.

1580
03:13:02,440 --> 03:13:03,553
It's... It's...

1581
03:13:03,732 --> 03:13:06,304
It's such a weight to carry.

1582
03:13:07,193 --> 03:13:08,223
It...

1583
03:13:08,402 --> 03:13:10,359
Such a weight.

1584
03:13:15,368 --> 03:13:17,775
We're going that way.
Straight as we can.

1585
03:13:19,246 --> 03:13:22,366
There's no point carrying anything
we're not sure to need.

1586
03:13:37,554 --> 03:13:39,382
Mr. Frodo.

1587
03:13:40,891 --> 03:13:42,385
Look.

1588
03:13:44,978 --> 03:13:46,805
There is light...

1589
03:13:47,148 --> 03:13:49,554
...and beauty up there...

1590
03:13:49,734 --> 03:13:51,441
...that no shadow can touch.

1591
03:14:42,492 --> 03:14:44,117
Take mine.

1592
03:14:44,617 --> 03:14:46,742
There's a few drops left.

1593
03:15:01,968 --> 03:15:04,542
There will be none left
for the return journey.

1594
03:15:05,471 --> 03:15:08,638
I don't think there will be
a return journey, Mr. Frodo.

1595
03:16:01,524 --> 03:16:03,684
Frodo, get down!

1596
03:16:05,446 --> 03:16:07,353
Hide!

1597
03:16:17,500 --> 03:16:19,536
Frodo!

1598
03:16:25,381 --> 03:16:26,791
Where are they?

1599
03:17:02,874 --> 03:17:05,911
Let the Lord of the Black Land come forth!

1600
03:17:06,836 --> 03:17:09,672
Let justice be done upon him!

1601
03:17:53,172 --> 03:17:57,122
My master, Sauron the Great,
bids thee welcome.

1602
03:18:02,972 --> 03:18:06,673
Is there any in this rout
with authority to treat with me?

1603
03:18:07,061 --> 03:18:10,180
We do not come to treat with Sauron...

1604
03:18:10,355 --> 03:18:13,309
...faithless and accursed.

1605
03:18:13,483 --> 03:18:16,898
Tell your master this:
The armies of Mordor must disband.

1606
03:18:17,069 --> 03:18:19,740
He is to depart these lands,
never to return.

1607
03:18:20,782 --> 03:18:23,320
Old Greybeard.

1608
03:18:24,744 --> 03:18:29,037
I have a token I was bidden
to show thee.

1609
03:18:34,044 --> 03:18:35,374
Frodo.

1610
03:18:38,215 --> 03:18:39,674
Frodo.

1611
03:18:40,677 --> 03:18:41,873
- Silence.
- No!

1612
03:18:42,718 --> 03:18:44,049
Silence!

1613
03:18:45,848 --> 03:18:49,594
The Halfling was dear to thee, I see.

1614
03:18:50,602 --> 03:18:54,682
Know that he suffered greatly
at the hands of his host.

1615
03:19:00,193 --> 03:19:05,948
Who would've thought one so small
could endure so much pain?

1616
03:19:08,576 --> 03:19:10,700
And he did, Gandalf.

1617
03:19:10,871 --> 03:19:12,615
He did.

1618
03:19:19,629 --> 03:19:21,124
And who is this?

1619
03:19:21,298 --> 03:19:23,374
Isildur's heir?

1620
03:19:23,550 --> 03:19:26,551
It takes more to make a king
than a broken Elvish blade.

1621
03:19:31,306 --> 03:19:33,880
I guess that concludes negotiations.

1622
03:19:36,021 --> 03:19:37,217
I do not believe it.

1623
03:19:39,232 --> 03:19:40,606
I will not.

1624
03:19:56,707 --> 03:19:58,498
Pull back.

1625
03:19:58,791 --> 03:20:00,831
Pull back!

1626
03:20:13,056 --> 03:20:15,094
It's gone, Mr. Frodo.

1627
03:20:17,559 --> 03:20:20,561
The light's passed on,
away towards the north.

1628
03:20:20,772 --> 03:20:22,563
Something's drawn its gaze.

1629
03:20:40,080 --> 03:20:42,832
Hold your ground! Hold your ground.

1630
03:20:44,920 --> 03:20:48,915
Sons of Gondor, of Rohan, my brothers!

1631
03:20:51,800 --> 03:20:53,675
I see in your eyes...

1632
03:20:54,052 --> 03:20:58,097
...the same fear that would take
the heart of me.

1633
03:21:00,058 --> 03:21:03,973
A day may come
when the courage of Men fails...

1634
03:21:04,144 --> 03:21:07,431
...when we forsake our friends
and break all bonds of fellowship.

1635
03:21:07,606 --> 03:21:10,276
But it is not this day.

1636
03:21:10,567 --> 03:21:13,604
An hour of wolves
and shattered shields...

1637
03:21:13,779 --> 03:21:16,650
...when the age of Men
comes crashing down.

1638
03:21:16,823 --> 03:21:19,281
But it is not this day.

1639
03:21:19,453 --> 03:21:21,111
This day we fight!

1640
03:21:23,581 --> 03:21:27,246
By all that you hold dear
on this good earth...

1641
03:21:27,417 --> 03:21:31,665
... I bid you stand, Men of the West!

1642
03:23:00,129 --> 03:23:03,665
Never thought I'd die fighting
side by side with an Elf.

1643
03:23:04,133 --> 03:23:06,460
What about side by side with a friend?

1644
03:23:10,015 --> 03:23:11,759
Aye.

1645
03:23:12,600 --> 03:23:14,392
I could do that.

1646
03:23:44,713 --> 03:23:46,790
Do you remember the Shire,
Mr. Frodo?

1647
03:23:49,761 --> 03:23:52,002
It'll be spring soon.

1648
03:23:52,806 --> 03:23:55,509
And the orchards will be in blossom.

1649
03:23:55,683 --> 03:23:59,348
And the birds will be nesting
in the hazel thicket.

1650
03:24:00,729 --> 03:24:04,726
And they'll be sowing
the summer barley in the lower fields...

1651
03:24:05,776 --> 03:24:10,154
...and eating the first
of the strawberries with cream.

1652
03:24:12,075 --> 03:24:14,564
Do you remember
the taste of strawberries?

1653
03:24:16,161 --> 03:24:17,869
No, Sam.

1654
03:24:18,037 --> 03:24:20,990
I can't recall the taste of food...

1655
03:24:22,124 --> 03:24:25,410
...nor the sound of water...

1656
03:24:25,586 --> 03:24:29,170
...nor the touch of grass.

1657
03:24:30,132 --> 03:24:31,675
I'm...

1658
03:24:32,552 --> 03:24:33,926
...naked in the dark.

1659
03:24:35,595 --> 03:24:37,885
There's-- There's nothing.

1660
03:24:38,057 --> 03:24:42,765
No veil between me
and the wheel of fire.

1661
03:24:44,021 --> 03:24:45,929
I can see him...

1662
03:24:46,357 --> 03:24:48,015
...with my waking eyes.

1663
03:24:49,067 --> 03:24:51,523
Then let us be rid of it...

1664
03:24:52,110 --> 03:24:54,354
...once and for all.

1665
03:24:55,073 --> 03:24:57,147
Come on, Mr. Frodo.

1666
03:24:57,324 --> 03:24:59,946
I can't carry it for you...

1667
03:25:00,370 --> 03:25:02,407
...but I can carry you.

1668
03:25:02,956 --> 03:25:04,698
Come on!

1669
03:25:35,109 --> 03:25:38,064
Aragorn.

1670
03:25:49,625 --> 03:25:52,246
Elessar.

1671
03:26:04,223 --> 03:26:06,629
For Frodo.

1672
03:26:41,590 --> 03:26:43,085
Look, Mr. Frodo.

1673
03:26:43,801 --> 03:26:46,006
A doorway.

1674
03:26:46,595 --> 03:26:48,255
We're almost there.

1675
03:26:50,600 --> 03:26:54,547
Clever Hobbits to climb so high!

1676
03:27:08,490 --> 03:27:10,149
Mustn't go that way.

1677
03:27:11,701 --> 03:27:14,158
Mustn't hurt the precious.

1678
03:27:14,329 --> 03:27:16,073
You swore!

1679
03:27:16,248 --> 03:27:18,324
You swore on the precious!

1680
03:27:20,211 --> 03:27:22,167
Sméagol promised!

1681
03:27:23,087 --> 03:27:25,082
Sméagol lied.

1682
03:28:17,597 --> 03:28:19,472
Frodo!

1683
03:28:46,584 --> 03:28:48,328
Eagles.

1684
03:28:49,754 --> 03:28:51,247
The eagles are coming!

1685
03:29:14,070 --> 03:29:15,941
Frodo!

1686
03:29:21,199 --> 03:29:22,482
I'm here, Sam.

1687
03:29:29,957 --> 03:29:31,582
Destroy it!

1688
03:29:42,135 --> 03:29:45,420
Go on! Now!

1689
03:29:45,597 --> 03:29:48,136
Throw it in the fire!

1690
03:30:01,531 --> 03:30:04,200
What are you waiting for?

1691
03:30:06,075 --> 03:30:08,448
Just let it go!

1692
03:30:41,651 --> 03:30:43,894
The Ring is mine.

1693
03:30:47,448 --> 03:30:49,191
No.

1694
03:30:49,617 --> 03:30:50,897
No.

1695
03:30:59,335 --> 03:31:02,004
No!

1696
03:32:46,436 --> 03:32:48,309
Yes!

1697
03:32:49,480 --> 03:32:51,188
Yes!

1698
03:32:52,317 --> 03:32:55,186
Precious! Precious!

1699
03:32:55,360 --> 03:32:58,529
Precious! Precious!

1700
03:33:51,456 --> 03:33:53,282
Give me your hand!

1701
03:34:01,632 --> 03:34:04,040
Take my hand!

1702
03:34:06,721 --> 03:34:08,049
No!

1703
03:34:15,312 --> 03:34:17,268
Don't you let go.

1704
03:34:21,860 --> 03:34:23,437
Don't let go.

1705
03:34:25,071 --> 03:34:26,530
Reach!

1706
03:35:55,699 --> 03:35:58,570
Frodo!

1707
03:35:59,161 --> 03:36:02,162
Frodo!

1708
03:37:23,532 --> 03:37:25,359
It's gone.

1709
03:37:29,829 --> 03:37:31,572
It's done.

1710
03:37:32,082 --> 03:37:34,075
Yes, Mr. Frodo.

1711
03:37:35,460 --> 03:37:37,868
It's over now.

1712
03:38:03,528 --> 03:38:05,899
I can see the Shire.

1713
03:38:08,117 --> 03:38:10,440
The Brandywine River.

1714
03:38:12,580 --> 03:38:14,570
Bag End.

1715
03:38:16,917 --> 03:38:19,620
Gandalf's fireworks.

1716
03:38:20,045 --> 03:38:23,793
The lights in the Party Tree.

1717
03:38:25,299 --> 03:38:28,418
Rosie Cotton dancing.

1718
03:38:29,554 --> 03:38:32,258
She had ribbons in her hair.

1719
03:38:35,183 --> 03:38:38,139
If ever I was to marry someone...

1720
03:38:39,063 --> 03:38:41,303
...it would've been her.

1721
03:38:42,733 --> 03:38:44,808
It would've been her.

1722
03:38:56,996 --> 03:39:00,162
I'm glad to be with you,
Samwise Gamgee...

1723
03:39:04,461 --> 03:39:07,378
...here at the end of all things.

1724
03:40:57,069 --> 03:40:59,108
Gandalf?

1725
03:41:18,756 --> 03:41:20,747
Frodo!

1726
03:41:40,527 --> 03:41:42,352
Gimli!

1727
03:43:25,333 --> 03:43:29,082
Now come the days of the king.

1728
03:43:34,092 --> 03:43:36,417
May they be blessed.

1729
03:43:56,697 --> 03:43:59,367
This day does not belong to one man...

1730
03:43:59,532 --> 03:44:01,405
...but to all.

1731
03:44:03,077 --> 03:44:05,997
Let us together rebuild this world...

1732
03:44:06,165 --> 03:44:10,411
...that we may share
in the days of peace.

1733
03:46:44,899 --> 03:46:46,974
My friends...

1734
03:46:52,278 --> 03:46:54,949
...you bow to no one.

1735
03:47:39,116 --> 03:47:41,239
And thus it was.

1736
03:47:41,409 --> 03:47:45,028
A Fourth Age of Middle-earth began.

1737
03:47:45,206 --> 03:47:47,743
And the Fellowship of the Ring...

1738
03:47:47,916 --> 03:47:52,412
...though eternally bound
by friendship and love...

1739
03:47:52,586 --> 03:47:54,995
...was ended.

1740
03:48:00,011 --> 03:48:04,803
Thirteen months to the day since Gandalf
sent us on our long journey...

1741
03:48:04,973 --> 03:48:09,185
...we found ourselves
looklng upon a familiar sight.

1742
03:48:11,730 --> 03:48:14,434
We were home.

1743
03:48:20,989 --> 03:48:22,862
Hi.

1744
03:48:40,048 --> 03:48:42,256
Hey, watch the pumpkin.

1745
03:49:30,346 --> 03:49:31,923
More of the same, Rosie.

1746
03:49:32,097 --> 03:49:34,092
Good night, lads.

1747
03:50:31,654 --> 03:50:35,652
How do you pick up the threads
of an old life?

1748
03:50:36,993 --> 03:50:39,199
How do you go on...

1749
03:50:39,370 --> 03:50:44,577
...when in your heart
you begin to understand...

1750
03:50:45,835 --> 03:50:48,789
...there is no going back?

1751
03:50:49,504 --> 03:50:53,170
There are some things
that time cannot mend...

1752
03:50:53,676 --> 03:50:56,593
...some hurts that go too deep...

1753
03:50:58,346 --> 03:51:01,182
...that have taken hold.

1754
03:51:21,869 --> 03:51:24,904
There and back again...
a hobbit's tale, by Bilbo Baggins

1755
03:51:39,344 --> 03:51:41,217
Mr. Frodo?

1756
03:51:44,558 --> 03:51:45,933
What is it?

1757
03:51:47,769 --> 03:51:51,718
It's been four years to the day
since Weathertop, Sam.

1758
03:51:52,398 --> 03:51:55,102
It's never really healed.

1759
03:51:59,072 --> 03:52:04,314
"There and Back Again. A Hobbit's Tale
by Bilbo Baggins.

1760
03:52:05,077 --> 03:52:08,860
And The Lord of the Rings
by Frodo Baggins."

1761
03:52:09,373 --> 03:52:11,529
You finished it.

1762
03:52:14,420 --> 03:52:15,913
Not quite.

1763
03:52:16,754 --> 03:52:19,292
There's room for a little more.

1764
03:52:21,926 --> 03:52:26,137
Bilbo once told me his part
in this tale would end...

1765
03:52:26,305 --> 03:52:29,590
...that each of us must come and go
in the telling.

1766
03:52:30,475 --> 03:52:33,310
Bilbo's story was now over.

1767
03:52:33,811 --> 03:52:36,730
There would be no more journeys
for him...

1768
03:52:36,899 --> 03:52:38,440
...save one.

1769
03:52:39,192 --> 03:52:42,774
Tell me again, lad,
where are we going?

1770
03:52:42,946 --> 03:52:44,939
To the harbour, Bilbo.

1771
03:52:45,115 --> 03:52:47,819
The Elves have accorded you
a special honour...

1772
03:52:47,991 --> 03:52:50,615
...a place on the last ship
to leave Middle-earth.

1773
03:52:52,331 --> 03:52:53,990
Frodo...

1774
03:52:55,416 --> 03:52:59,958
...any chance of seeing
that old Ring of mine again?

1775
03:53:00,587 --> 03:53:02,830
The one I gave you.

1776
03:53:06,469 --> 03:53:08,626
I'm sorry, Uncle.

1777
03:53:11,181 --> 03:53:13,801
I'm afraid I lost it.

1778
03:53:13,976 --> 03:53:15,766
Oh.

1779
03:53:16,394 --> 03:53:17,853
Pity.

1780
03:53:20,606 --> 03:53:24,474
I should like to have held it
one last time.

1781
03:53:53,639 --> 03:53:58,679
Well, here's a sight
I have never seen before.

1782
03:54:12,865 --> 03:54:16,197
The power of the Three Rings is ended.

1783
03:54:16,994 --> 03:54:19,781
The time has come...

1784
03:54:19,955 --> 03:54:23,241
...for the dominion of Men.

1785
03:54:24,375 --> 03:54:27,210
The sea calls us home.

1786
03:54:35,635 --> 03:54:37,794
I think I'm...

1787
03:54:37,972 --> 03:54:42,348
...quite ready
for another adventure.

1788
03:55:13,422 --> 03:55:15,712
Farewell...

1789
03:55:15,884 --> 03:55:18,634
...my brave Hobbits.

1790
03:55:20,596 --> 03:55:22,589
My work is now finished.

1791
03:55:26,516 --> 03:55:31,394
Here at last,
on the shores of the sea...

1792
03:55:32,065 --> 03:55:34,900
...comes the end of our Fellowship.

1793
03:55:38,445 --> 03:55:40,937
I will not say, "Do not weep"...

1794
03:55:41,616 --> 03:55:45,613
...for not all tears are an evil.

1795
03:56:03,178 --> 03:56:05,087
It is time, Frodo.

1796
03:56:10,643 --> 03:56:12,636
What does he mean?

1797
03:56:15,106 --> 03:56:17,977
We set out to save the Shire, Sam.

1798
03:56:19,569 --> 03:56:22,320
And it has been saved.

1799
03:56:25,990 --> 03:56:28,659
But not for me.

1800
03:56:29,578 --> 03:56:32,032
You don't mean that.

1801
03:56:33,249 --> 03:56:35,324
You can't leave.

1802
03:56:43,800 --> 03:56:46,505
The last pages are for you, Sam.

1803
04:00:19,588 --> 04:00:22,458
My dear Sam.

1804
04:00:24,383 --> 04:00:27,717
You cannot always be torn in two.

1805
04:00:27,886 --> 04:00:32,014
You will have to be one and whole
for many years.

1806
04:00:32,766 --> 04:00:38,222
You have so much to enjoy
and to be and to do.

1807
04:00:39,482 --> 04:00:42,648
Your part in the story will go on.

1808
04:00:43,401 --> 04:00:45,144
Well...

1809
04:00:47,031 --> 04:00:48,738
... I'm back.

1810
04:02:31,338 --> 04:02:35,334
<i># Lay down</i>

1811
04:02:36,925 --> 04:02:41,337
<i># Your sweet and weary head</i>

1812
04:02:43,056 --> 04:02:46,639
<i># Night is falling</i>

1813
04:02:47,311 --> 04:02:52,139
<i># You have come
To journey's end</i>

1814
04:02:52,816 --> 04:02:56,566
<i># Sleep now</i>

1815
04:02:56,737 --> 04:03:02,406
<i># And dream
Of the ones who came before</i>

1816
04:03:04,160 --> 04:03:08,074
<i># They are calling</i>

1817
04:03:08,247 --> 04:03:12,374
<i># From across
The distant shore</i>

1818
04:03:13,962 --> 04:03:18,873
<i># Why do you weep?</i>

1819
04:03:19,051 --> 04:03:24,044
<i># What are these tears
Upon your face?</i>

1820
04:03:24,221 --> 04:03:29,262
<i># Soon you will see</i>

1821
04:03:29,435 --> 04:03:34,393
<i># All of your fears
Will pass away</i>

1822
04:03:34,565 --> 04:03:39,641
<i># Safe in my arms</i>

1823
04:03:39,820 --> 04:03:44,315
<i># You're only sleeping</i>

1824
04:03:44,490 --> 04:03:49,484
<i># What can you see</i>

1825
04:03:49,662 --> 04:03:54,903
<i># On the horizon?</i>

1826
04:03:55,084 --> 04:04:04,462
<i># Why do the white gulls call?</i>

1827
04:04:05,636 --> 04:04:10,261
<i># Across the sea</i>

1828
04:04:10,431 --> 04:04:15,674
<i># A pale moon rises</i>

1829
04:04:15,853 --> 04:04:18,559
<i># The ships have come</i>

1830
04:04:18,731 --> 04:04:24,520
<i># To carry you home</i>

1831
04:04:26,780 --> 04:04:31,324
<i># And all will turn</i>

1832
04:04:31,494 --> 04:04:36,832
<i># To silver glass</i>

1833
04:04:36,997 --> 04:04:41,245
<i># A light on the water</i>

1834
04:04:41,419 --> 04:04:46,924
<i># All souls pass</i>

1835
04:04:47,092 --> 04:04:51,302
<i># Hope fades</i>

1836
04:04:52,847 --> 04:04:57,756
<i># Into the world of night</i>

1837
04:04:58,477 --> 04:05:02,310
<i># Through shadows falling</i>

1838
04:05:03,147 --> 04:05:08,271
<i># Out of memory and time</i>

1839
04:05:08,986 --> 04:05:12,688
<i># Don't say</i>

1840
04:05:13,490 --> 04:05:18,485
<i># We have come now to the end</i>

1841
04:05:19,329 --> 04:05:23,742
<i># White shores are calling</i>

1842
04:05:23,919 --> 04:05:27,453
<i># You and I will meet again</i>

1843
04:05:27,630 --> 04:05:34,081
<i># And you'll be here
in my arms</i>

1844
04:05:35,304 --> 04:05:39,382
<i># Just sleeping</i>

1845
04:05:39,558 --> 04:05:44,385
<i># What can you see</i>

1846
04:05:44,561 --> 04:05:49,519
<i># On the horizon?</i>

1847
04:05:49,691 --> 04:05:54,485
<i># Why do the white gulls</i>

1848
04:05:54,654 --> 04:06:00,074
<i># Call?</i>

1849
04:06:00,244 --> 04:06:05,321
<i># Across the sea</i>

1850
04:06:05,499 --> 04:06:10,494
<i># A pale moon rlses</i>

1851
04:06:10,670 --> 04:06:13,458

1852
04:06:13,630 --> 04:06:19,967

1853
04:06:21,180 --> 04:06:26,305

1854
04:06:26,895 --> 04:06:31,721
<i># To silver glass</i>

1855
04:06:31,899 --> 04:06:36,026
<i># A light on the water</i>

1856
04:06:36,194 --> 04:06:40,062
<i># Grey ships pass</i>

1857
04:06:40,240 --> 04:06:45,911
<i># Into the west</i>
