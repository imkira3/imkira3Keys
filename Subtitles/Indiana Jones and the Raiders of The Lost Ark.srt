1
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,472
The Hovitos are near.

2
00:02:18,807 --> 00:02:21,059
The poison is still fresh,
three days.

3
00:02:21,142 --> 00:02:22,811
They're following us.

4
00:02:24,145 --> 00:02:27,816
If they knew we were here,
they would've killed us already.

5
00:03:53,151 --> 00:03:54,861
This is it.

6
00:03:54,986 --> 00:03:56,821
This is where Forrestal
cashed in.

7
00:03:57,155 --> 00:03:59,073
- A friend of yours?
- A competitor.

8
00:03:59,407 --> 00:04:01,784
He was good.

9
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,494
He was very, very good.

10
00:04:03,578 --> 00:04:07,415
I Senor, nobody's
come out of there alive

11
00:04:07,498 --> 00:04:09,500
Please...

12
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:47,455
Senor.

13
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:17,694
Stop.

14
00:05:18,528 --> 00:05:19,821
Stay out of the light.

15
00:05:42,427 --> 00:05:43,886
Forrestal.

16
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,602
Let us hurry.
There is nothing to fear here.

17
00:06:35,772 --> 00:06:37,148
That's what scares me.

18
00:06:56,084 --> 00:06:57,335
Stay here.

19
00:06:57,543 --> 00:06:59,170
I
If you insist, senor.

20
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:26,924
Give me the whip.

21
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:28,217
Throw me the idol.

22
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,929
No time to argue.

23
00:08:32,096 --> 00:08:33,097
Throw me the idol,
I throw you the whip.

24
00:08:34,432 --> 00:08:35,892
Give me the whip!

25
00:08:35,975 --> 00:08:37,643
I
Adios, senor.

26
00:09:21,103 --> 00:09:22,480
Adios, Satipo.

27
00:10:02,979 --> 00:10:04,480
Dr. Jones.

28
00:10:04,897 --> 00:10:07,358
Again we see there is nothing
you can possess

29
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:09,068
which I cannot take away.

30
00:10:09,485 --> 00:10:11,070
And you thought I had given up.

31
00:10:22,665 --> 00:10:25,918
You chose the wrong friends.
This time, it will cost you.

32
00:10:29,505 --> 00:10:33,843
Too bad the Hovitos
don't know you the way I do, Belloq.

33
00:10:34,385 --> 00:10:35,928
Yes, too bad.

34
00:10:36,762 --> 00:10:40,766
You could warn them,
if only you spoke Hovitos.

35
00:11:27,813 --> 00:11:29,148
Jock! Start the engines!

36
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:30,941
Get it up!

37
00:11:35,071 --> 00:11:36,822
Jock, the engines!

38
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:39,283
Start the engines, Jock!

39
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:31,043
There's a big snake in the plane, Jock!

40
00:12:31,836 --> 00:12:34,380
Oh, that's just
my pet snake Reggie!

41
00:12:35,256 --> 00:12:37,007
I hate snakes, Jock!

42
00:12:37,091 --> 00:12:38,217
I hate 'em!

43
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:41,220
Come on!
Show a little backbone, will ya?

44
00:12:57,987 --> 00:12:59,280
"Neo," meaning "new"

45
00:12:59,363 --> 00:13:03,075
and "Lithic"... "L-T-H"...

46
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,995
meaning "stone."

47
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:07,788
All right, let's get back to this site:

48
00:13:07,872 --> 00:13:09,457
Turkdean Barrow, near Hazelton.

49
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:14,336
Contains a central passage
and three chambers, or cysts...

50
00:13:19,884 --> 00:13:23,220
...don't confuse that
with robbing, in which case we mean

51
00:13:23,554 --> 00:13:26,307
the removal of the contents
of the barrow.

52
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,309
This site also demonstrates...

53
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,980
...one of the great dangers
of archeology,

54
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:36,233
not to life and limb, although
that does sometimes take place.

55
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:38,652
No, I'm talking about folklore.

56
00:13:38,736 --> 00:13:40,446
In this case,
local tradition held

57
00:13:40,571 --> 00:13:43,991
that there was a golden coffin
buried at the site,

58
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:47,328
and this accounts for the holes
dug all over the barrow

59
00:13:47,411 --> 00:13:49,705
and the generally poor condition
of the find.

60
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:52,708
However, chamber three
was undisturbed,

61
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,418
and the undisturbed chamber
and the grave goods

62
00:13:54,502 --> 00:13:55,920
that were found in another, uh...

63
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,339
in the area, give us a r...

64
00:14:00,257 --> 00:14:01,550
Uh...

65
00:14:02,927 --> 00:14:05,971
...reason to da...
to, uh, to-to date this,

66
00:14:06,055 --> 00:14:07,681
uh, find as we have.

67
00:14:07,765 --> 00:14:08,807
Um...

68
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:10,142
Any questions, then?

69
00:14:10,935 --> 00:14:12,728
No? Okay, that's it
for the day, then.

70
00:14:13,771 --> 00:14:15,481
Um, don't forget...

71
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:19,360
Michaelson, chapters four
and five for next time.

72
00:14:19,443 --> 00:14:22,154
And I will be in my office
on Thursday, but not Wednesday.

73
00:14:32,248 --> 00:14:33,332
I had it, Marcus.

74
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:35,709
I had it in my hand.

75
00:14:35,793 --> 00:14:37,628
- What happened?
- Guess.

76
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,549
- Belloq?
- You want to hear about it?

77
00:14:41,632 --> 00:14:43,217
Not at all.

78
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,094
I'm sure everything you do
for the museum

79
00:14:45,177 --> 00:14:48,305
conforms to the International Treaty
for the Protection of Antiquities.

80
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,640
It's beautiful, Marcus.

81
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:51,642
I can get it.
I got it all figured out.

82
00:14:51,809 --> 00:14:53,352
There's only one place
he can sell it: Marrakech.

83
00:14:53,435 --> 00:14:54,728
I need $2,000. Look...

84
00:14:54,812 --> 00:14:55,896
Listen to me, old boy.

85
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,356
I brought some people
to see you.

86
00:14:57,439 --> 00:14:58,440
Look.

87
00:14:58,524 --> 00:14:59,608
I got these pieces.

88
00:14:59,692 --> 00:15:00,943
They're good pieces, Marcus.

89
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:03,070
- Look.
- Indiana...

90
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:06,198
Yes, the museum will buy them,
as usual, no questions asked.

91
00:15:06,282 --> 00:15:07,741
- Yes, they are nice.
- They're worth at least

92
00:15:07,825 --> 00:15:09,159
the price
of a ticket to Marrakech.

93
00:15:09,285 --> 00:15:10,494
But the people
I brought are important,

94
00:15:10,578 --> 00:15:11,954
-and they're waiting.
- What people?

95
00:15:12,037 --> 00:15:13,914
Army Intelligence.

96
00:15:14,123 --> 00:15:15,624
They knew you were coming
before I did.

97
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:17,167
Seem to know everything.

98
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:19,253
They wouldn't tell me
what they want.

99
00:15:19,378 --> 00:15:21,338
Well, what do I want
to see them for?

100
00:15:21,422 --> 00:15:23,340
What am I, in trouble?

101
00:15:23,674 --> 00:15:24,800
Yes, Dr. Jones,

102
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:26,343
we've heard a great deal
about you.

103
00:15:26,427 --> 00:15:28,137
Have you?

104
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,431
Uh, professor of archeology,

105
00:15:30,514 --> 00:15:32,182
expert on the occult,

106
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:33,809
and, uh, how does one say it?

107
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:36,562
Obtainer of rare antiquities.

108
00:15:36,687 --> 00:15:37,771
That's one way of saying it.

109
00:15:37,855 --> 00:15:39,106
Why don't you sit down?
You'll be more comfortable.

110
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:40,691
- Oh, thank you.
- Thank you.

111
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:44,069
Yes, you're a man
of many talents.

112
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:46,488
Now, you studied
under Professor Ravenwood

113
00:15:46,614 --> 00:15:48,282
at the University of Chicago.

114
00:15:48,407 --> 00:15:50,618
Yes, I did.

115
00:15:50,701 --> 00:15:53,245
You have no idea
of his present whereabouts?

116
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:56,624
Uh... well, just rumors, really.

117
00:15:56,707 --> 00:15:58,375
Somewhere in Asia, I think.

118
00:15:58,459 --> 00:16:00,127
I haven't really spoken
to him for ten years.

119
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:02,796
We were friends, but, uh...

120
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,090
had a bit of a falling out,
I'm afraid.

121
00:16:05,174 --> 00:16:06,342
Mmm.

122
00:16:06,717 --> 00:16:08,969
Dr. Jones, now,
you must understand

123
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:11,764
that this is all
strictly confidential, eh?

124
00:16:11,847 --> 00:16:12,806
I understand.

125
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:15,267
Uh...

126
00:16:15,351 --> 00:16:18,896
Yesterday afternoon,
our European sections

127
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:21,732
intercepted a...
a German communique

128
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:24,234
that was sent
from Cairo to Berlin.

129
00:16:24,777 --> 00:16:26,612
- Now, to Cairo...
- See, over the last two years,

130
00:16:26,737 --> 00:16:28,697
the Nazis have had teams
of archeologists

131
00:16:28,781 --> 00:16:32,743
running around the world looking
for all kinds of religious artifacts.

132
00:16:33,035 --> 00:16:34,370
Hitler's a nut on the subject.

133
00:16:34,453 --> 00:16:35,496
He's crazy.

134
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:37,623
He's obsessed with the occult.

135
00:16:37,748 --> 00:16:39,333
And, right now, apparently,

136
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,835
there's some kind
of German archeological dig

137
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:44,004
going on in the desert
outside of Cairo.

138
00:16:44,088 --> 00:16:45,589
Now, we've got some
information here,

139
00:16:45,673 --> 00:16:48,217
but we can't make anything
out of it, and maybe you can.

140
00:16:49,343 --> 00:16:52,179
"Tanis development proceeding.

141
00:16:52,638 --> 00:16:56,475
"Acquire headpiece, Staff of Ra.

142
00:16:56,642 --> 00:16:58,727
"Abner Ravenwood, U.S."

143
00:17:00,104 --> 00:17:02,398
The Nazis have discovered Tanis.

144
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:05,567
Just what does that mean to you,
uh, Tanis?

145
00:17:05,651 --> 00:17:06,694
Well, it...

146
00:17:06,777 --> 00:17:09,196
The city of Tanis is one of the possible
resting places of the Lost Ark.

147
00:17:09,488 --> 00:17:10,948
The Lost Ark?

148
00:17:11,073 --> 00:17:12,282
Yeah, the Ark of the Covenant.

149
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:13,534
The chest the Hebrews used

150
00:17:13,617 --> 00:17:14,952
to carry around
the Ten Commandments.

151
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:16,120
What do you mean,
"commandments"?

152
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:17,705
You talking
about the Ten Commandments?

153
00:17:17,788 --> 00:17:19,873
Yes, the actual
Ten Commandments.

154
00:17:19,957 --> 00:17:21,458
The original stone tablets

155
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:23,502
that Moses brought down
out of Mount Horeb and smashed,

156
00:17:23,627 --> 00:17:25,629
if you believe
in that sort of thing.

157
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,590
Any of you guys
ever go to Sunday school?

158
00:17:28,674 --> 00:17:30,676
- Well, I...
- Oh, look.

159
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:32,344
The Hebrews took
the broken pieces

160
00:17:32,428 --> 00:17:34,805
and put them in the Ark.
When they settled in Canaan,

161
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:37,516
they put the Ark in a place
called the Temple of Solomon.

162
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:38,642
In Jerusalem.

163
00:17:38,726 --> 00:17:40,227
Where it stayed for many years.

164
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,396
Until, all of a sudden,
whoosh, it's gone.

165
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:43,647
Where?

166
00:17:43,731 --> 00:17:45,607
Well, nobody knows
where or when.

167
00:17:45,691 --> 00:17:47,568
However, an Egyptian pharaoh...

168
00:17:47,651 --> 00:17:48,652
- Shishak.
- Yes.

169
00:17:48,736 --> 00:17:51,488
...Invaded the city of Jerusalem
right about 980 BC,

170
00:17:51,572 --> 00:17:54,533
and he may have taken the Ark
back to the city of Tanis

171
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:56,535
and hidden it
in a secret chamber

172
00:17:56,618 --> 00:17:57,870
called the Well of Souls.

173
00:17:58,454 --> 00:17:59,538
Secret chamber?

174
00:17:59,621 --> 00:18:01,248
However, about a year

175
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:03,500
after the pharaoh
would return to Egypt,

176
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:06,837
the city of Tanis was
consumed by the desert

177
00:18:06,962 --> 00:18:10,007
in a sandstorm which
lasted a whole year.

178
00:18:10,174 --> 00:18:12,342
Wiped clean by the wrath of God.

179
00:18:14,678 --> 00:18:16,096
Uh-huh.

180
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,890
Obviously, we've come
to the right men.

181
00:18:17,973 --> 00:18:19,516
Now you seem to know, uh,

182
00:18:19,683 --> 00:18:20,851
all about this Tanis, then.

183
00:18:21,185 --> 00:18:22,352
No, no, not really.

184
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:24,855
Ravenwood is the real expert.

185
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,940
Abner did the first serious work
on Tanis.

186
00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:29,568
Collected some of its relics.

187
00:18:29,777 --> 00:18:32,446
It was his obsession, really.

188
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:33,864
But he never found the city.

189
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:37,284
Frankly, we're somewhat
suspicious of Mr. Ravenwood.

190
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:39,036
An American being mentioned
so prominently

191
00:18:39,161 --> 00:18:41,288
in a secret Nazi cable.

192
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:43,707
Oh, rubbish.
Ravenwood's no Nazi.

193
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:45,542
Well, what do the Nazis
want him for, then?

194
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:48,086
Well, obviously,
the Nazis are looking

195
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:49,963
for the headpiece
to the Staff of Ra

196
00:18:50,214 --> 00:18:52,257
and they think Abner's got it.

197
00:18:52,341 --> 00:18:55,010
What exactly is a headpiece
to the Staff of Ra?

198
00:18:55,219 --> 00:18:56,595
Well, the staff
is just a stick...

199
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,930
I don't know, about this big,

200
00:18:58,138 --> 00:18:59,765
nobody really knows
for sure how high...

201
00:18:59,848 --> 00:19:02,851
And it's... it's, uh...
it's capped

202
00:19:02,935 --> 00:19:05,437
with an elaborate headpiece...

203
00:19:05,521 --> 00:19:08,482
in the shape of the sun,
with a crystal in the center.

204
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:10,150
And what you did was

205
00:19:10,234 --> 00:19:12,986
you take the staff
to a special room in Tanis...

206
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,404
A map room with a miniature

207
00:19:14,488 --> 00:19:15,906
of the city all laid out
on the floor,

208
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:17,991
and if you put the staff
in a certain place,

209
00:19:18,075 --> 00:19:20,953
at a certain time of day,
the sun shone through here

210
00:19:21,036 --> 00:19:24,790
and made a beam that came down
on the floor here...

211
00:19:24,873 --> 00:19:27,793
and gave you the exact location
of the Well of the Souls.

212
00:19:28,085 --> 00:19:30,295
Where the Ark of the Covenant
was kept, right?

213
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,631
Which is exactly what the Nazis
are looking for.

214
00:19:32,714 --> 00:19:34,967
What does this Ark look like?

215
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:36,385
Uh...

216
00:19:36,885 --> 00:19:38,762
There's a picture of it
right here.

217
00:19:43,475 --> 00:19:45,269
That's it.

218
00:19:51,942 --> 00:19:53,110
Good God.

219
00:19:53,277 --> 00:19:55,737
Yes, that's just
what the Hebrews thought.

220
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:57,197
Uh...

221
00:19:57,281 --> 00:19:59,741
now, what's that supposed to be
coming out of there?

222
00:19:59,825 --> 00:20:01,493
Lightning...

223
00:20:01,577 --> 00:20:03,537
fire...

224
00:20:03,662 --> 00:20:05,789
power of God or something.

225
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:08,667
I'm beginning to understand

226
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,168
Hitler's interest in this.

227
00:20:10,294 --> 00:20:11,628
Oh, yes.

228
00:20:11,712 --> 00:20:13,881
The Bible speaks of the
Ark leveling mountains,

229
00:20:13,964 --> 00:20:17,467
and laying waste
to entire regions.

230
00:20:17,551 --> 00:20:21,430
An army which carries
the Ark before it...

231
00:20:21,513 --> 00:20:22,973
is invincible.

232
00:20:43,535 --> 00:20:45,537
You did it, didn't you?

233
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:47,247
They want you to go for it.

234
00:20:47,331 --> 00:20:49,750
Oh, Marcus!

235
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:52,544
They want you to get a hold of
the Ark before the Nazis do

236
00:20:52,628 --> 00:20:54,796
and they're prepared
to pay handsomely for it.

237
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,048
And the museum?

238
00:20:56,131 --> 00:20:57,382
The museum gets the Ark
when we're finished?

239
00:20:57,466 --> 00:20:58,842
Oh, yes.

240
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:03,388
Oh...

241
00:21:03,472 --> 00:21:05,515
The Ark of the Covenant.

242
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:08,268
Nothing else has come close.

243
00:21:08,352 --> 00:21:09,561
That thing represents everything

244
00:21:09,645 --> 00:21:13,065
we got into archeology
for in the first place.

245
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:15,817
Mmm!

246
00:21:16,026 --> 00:21:18,487
You know, five years ago,
I would've gone after it myself.

247
00:21:18,612 --> 00:21:20,781
I'm really rather envious.

248
00:21:20,948 --> 00:21:22,950
I've got to locate Abner.

249
00:21:23,033 --> 00:21:24,701
I think I know where to start.

250
00:21:29,623 --> 00:21:31,792
Suppose she'll
still be with him?

251
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,794
Possibly, but...

252
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:35,921
Marion's the least
of your worries right now,

253
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:37,631
believe me, Indy.

254
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:39,675
What do you mean?

255
00:21:39,758 --> 00:21:42,552
Well, I mean that
for nearly 3,000 years,

256
00:21:42,636 --> 00:21:46,765
man has been searching
for the Lost Ark.

257
00:21:46,848 --> 00:21:50,602
Not something to be taken
lightly.

258
00:21:50,686 --> 00:21:54,648
No one knows its secrets.

259
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:58,110
It's like nothing you've ever
gone after before.

260
00:21:58,568 --> 00:22:00,195
Oh, Marcus.

261
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:01,780
What are you trying to do,
scare me?

262
00:22:01,863 --> 00:22:02,864
You sound like my mother.

263
00:22:02,948 --> 00:22:04,324
We've known each other
for a long time.

264
00:22:04,408 --> 00:22:07,995
I don't believe in magic,
a lot of superstitious hocus-pocus.

265
00:22:08,078 --> 00:22:09,204
I'm going after a find

266
00:22:09,287 --> 00:22:11,039
of incredible
historical significance.

267
00:22:11,123 --> 00:22:13,000
You're talking
about the bogeyman.

268
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:15,669
Besides, you know
what a cautious fellow I am.

269
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,056
Nice to see you again,
Dr. Jones.

270
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,141
Thank you.

271
00:23:42,047 --> 00:23:43,465
Shh... shh...

272
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:02,651
Shh...

273
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:36,309
Give him space!
Give him space!

274
00:24:36,393 --> 00:24:37,853
Go on, Regan!

275
00:24:40,105 --> 00:24:42,149
Shh! Shh!

276
00:24:42,232 --> 00:24:43,692
Shh! Shh! Shh!

277
00:25:28,361 --> 00:25:29,821
Hello, Marion.

278
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,455
Indiana Jones.

279
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:43,001
Always knew, someday,

280
00:25:43,084 --> 00:25:45,128
you'd come walking back
through my door.

281
00:25:45,712 --> 00:25:47,464
I never doubted that.

282
00:25:47,547 --> 00:25:49,841
Something made it inevitable.

283
00:25:49,925 --> 00:25:52,427
So, what are you doing here
in Nepal?

284
00:25:52,802 --> 00:25:55,430
I need one of the pieces
your father collected.

285
00:25:55,597 --> 00:25:59,893
I learned to hate you
in the last ten years.

286
00:25:59,976 --> 00:26:01,311
I never meant to hurt you.

287
00:26:01,394 --> 00:26:02,437
I was a child.

288
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,730
I was in love.

289
00:26:03,897 --> 00:26:05,482
It was wrong and you knew it!

290
00:26:05,607 --> 00:26:06,858
You knew what you were doing.

291
00:26:06,942 --> 00:26:08,485
Now I do!
This is my place.

292
00:26:08,818 --> 00:26:09,819
Get out!

293
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,324
I did what I did.

294
00:26:14,407 --> 00:26:15,492
You don't have to be happy
about it,

295
00:26:15,575 --> 00:26:17,452
but maybe we could help
each other out now.

296
00:26:19,412 --> 00:26:21,414
I need one of the pieces
your father collected.

297
00:26:21,498 --> 00:26:22,666
Bronze piece, about this size,

298
00:26:22,749 --> 00:26:24,918
with a hole in it, off-center,
with a crystal.

299
00:26:25,001 --> 00:26:26,086
You know the one I mean?

300
00:26:26,169 --> 00:26:27,796
Yeah.

301
00:26:27,879 --> 00:26:29,089
I know it.

302
00:26:29,172 --> 00:26:33,718
Where's Abner?

303
00:26:33,802 --> 00:26:35,011
Abner's dead.

304
00:26:40,225 --> 00:26:43,103
Marion, I'm sorry.

305
00:26:43,186 --> 00:26:45,605
Do you know what you did to me,
to my life?

306
00:26:45,689 --> 00:26:48,233
I can only say
I'm sorry so many times.

307
00:26:48,316 --> 00:26:50,151
Well, say it again, anyway.

308
00:26:50,235 --> 00:26:51,278
Sorry.

309
00:26:51,361 --> 00:26:53,488
Yeah, everybody's sorry.

310
00:26:53,571 --> 00:26:55,448
Abner was sorry for dragging me
all over this earth

311
00:26:55,532 --> 00:26:57,200
looking
for his little bits of junk.

312
00:26:57,284 --> 00:26:59,619
I'm sorry to still be
stuck in this dive.

313
00:27:00,537 --> 00:27:03,081
Everybody's sorry for something.

314
00:27:03,164 --> 00:27:04,958
It's a worthless bronze
medallion, Marion.

315
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:06,084
You going to give it to me?

316
00:27:06,167 --> 00:27:07,168
Maybe.

317
00:27:07,252 --> 00:27:09,004
I don't know where it is.

318
00:27:09,087 --> 00:27:12,507
Well, maybe you could find it.

319
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:15,719
3,000 bucks.

320
00:27:15,802 --> 00:27:19,764
Well, that will get me back,
but not in style.

321
00:27:19,848 --> 00:27:22,225
I can get you another two
when we get to the States.

322
00:27:22,309 --> 00:27:24,060
It's important, Marion.

323
00:27:25,437 --> 00:27:26,688
Trust me.

324
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:29,649
You know the piece I mean?

325
00:27:29,733 --> 00:27:31,401
Do you know where it is?

326
00:27:34,863 --> 00:27:35,989
Come back tomorrow.

327
00:27:37,532 --> 00:27:38,533
VVhy?

328
00:27:38,908 --> 00:27:41,453
Because I said so, that's why.

329
00:27:48,752 --> 00:27:49,753
Ha!

330
00:27:49,836 --> 00:27:51,963
See you tomorrow, Indiana Jones.

331
00:29:00,156 --> 00:29:02,242
Good evening, Fraulein.

332
00:29:02,325 --> 00:29:03,952
The bar's closed.

333
00:29:04,035 --> 00:29:07,080
We... We are...

334
00:29:07,163 --> 00:29:09,082
not thirsty.

335
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:10,875
What do you want?

336
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:13,753
The same thing your friend
Dr. Jones wanted.

337
00:29:13,837 --> 00:29:16,131
Surely he told you
there would be

338
00:29:16,214 --> 00:29:18,341
other interested parties.

339
00:29:18,425 --> 00:29:20,760
Must've slipped his mind.

340
00:29:20,844 --> 00:29:24,097
The man is... nefarious.

341
00:29:25,181 --> 00:29:28,435
I hope, for your sake,
he has not yet acquired it.

342
00:29:28,726 --> 00:29:30,770
Why, are you willing
to offer more?

343
00:29:31,396 --> 00:29:34,107
Oh, almost certainly.

344
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:35,817
Do you still have it?

345
00:29:41,531 --> 00:29:42,824
No.

346
00:29:43,825 --> 00:29:45,743
But I know where it is.

347
00:29:47,036 --> 00:29:49,622
Hey, how about a drink
for you and your men?

348
00:29:49,706 --> 00:29:54,627
Your fire is dying here.

349
00:29:54,711 --> 00:29:57,464
Why don't you tell me
where the piece is right now?

350
00:29:57,881 --> 00:30:00,049
Listen, Herr Mac...

351
00:30:01,009 --> 00:30:04,429
I don't know what kind of people
you're used to dealing with,

352
00:30:04,512 --> 00:30:06,931
but nobody tells me
what to do in my place.

353
00:30:07,015 --> 00:30:10,560
Fraulein Ravenwood,

354
00:30:10,643 --> 00:30:14,522
let me show you
what I am used to.

355
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:20,028
Take your hands off me!

356
00:30:21,613 --> 00:30:23,781
Take your lousy hands off!

357
00:30:30,705 --> 00:30:31,748
Wait a minute.

358
00:30:31,831 --> 00:30:33,166
Wait, I... I can be reasonable.

359
00:30:33,249 --> 00:30:34,834
That time is passed.

360
00:30:34,918 --> 00:30:36,586
You don't need that.

361
00:30:38,755 --> 00:30:39,881
Wait...

362
00:30:41,591 --> 00:30:43,760
I'll tell you everything.

363
00:30:43,843 --> 00:30:46,679
Yes, I know you will.

364
00:30:53,186 --> 00:30:54,187
Let her go.

365
00:32:09,429 --> 00:32:10,430
Whiskey.

366
00:32:19,522 --> 00:32:20,648
Shoot them.

367
00:32:21,316 --> 00:32:22,525
Shoot them both.

368
00:33:17,705 --> 00:33:18,873
My medallion!

369
00:33:26,589 --> 00:33:29,050
Well, Jones, at least
you haven't forgotten

370
00:33:29,133 --> 00:33:30,927
how to show a lady a good time!

371
00:33:31,052 --> 00:33:32,595
Boy, you're something!

372
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:33,846
Yeah, I'll tell you what.

373
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:35,723
Until I get back my $5,000,

374
00:33:35,807 --> 00:33:37,892
you're going to get more
than you bargained for.

375
00:33:37,975 --> 00:33:40,436
I'm your goddamn partner!

376
00:34:18,474 --> 00:34:20,727
Cairo, city of the living.

377
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:22,562
A paradise on earth.

378
00:34:24,355 --> 00:34:25,523
Silence!

379
00:34:25,606 --> 00:34:27,108
Why do you forget yourselves?

380
00:34:27,191 --> 00:34:28,609
What is this?

381
00:34:28,693 --> 00:34:30,486
Where did this animal come from?

382
00:34:33,948 --> 00:34:35,116
Oh... oh, no.

383
00:34:38,286 --> 00:34:39,454
Cute.

384
00:34:39,537 --> 00:34:41,330
What an adorable creature.

385
00:34:43,291 --> 00:34:45,585
Then it shall be welcome
in our house.

386
00:34:45,668 --> 00:34:47,920
Oh, well, no, you don't have to
keep it here just because of me.

387
00:34:56,137 --> 00:34:58,723
I knew the Germans
would hire you, Sallah.

388
00:34:58,806 --> 00:35:00,933
You're the best digger in Egypt.

389
00:35:01,017 --> 00:35:04,145
My services are entirely
inconsequential to them.

390
00:35:04,771 --> 00:35:07,315
They've hired or shanghaied
every digger in Cairo.

391
00:35:07,398 --> 00:35:09,150
The excavation is enormous.

392
00:35:09,442 --> 00:35:14,030
They hire only strong backs
and they pay pennies for them.

393
00:35:14,113 --> 00:35:16,491
It's as if the pharaohs
had returned.

394
00:35:16,699 --> 00:35:18,367
When did they find the map room?

395
00:35:18,659 --> 00:35:19,994
Three days ago.

396
00:35:20,077 --> 00:35:22,330
They have not one brain
among them.

397
00:35:22,413 --> 00:35:24,373
Except one.

398
00:35:24,457 --> 00:35:26,542
He is very clever.
He's a French archeologist.

399
00:35:29,212 --> 00:35:30,213
What's his name?

400
00:35:30,338 --> 00:35:31,547
They call him "Bellosh."

401
00:35:38,387 --> 00:35:40,223
Belloq. Belloq.

402
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:44,352
The Germans have
a great advantage over us.

403
00:35:44,435 --> 00:35:46,729
They are near to discovering
the Well of Souls.

404
00:35:47,188 --> 00:35:51,567
Well, they're not
going to find it without this.

405
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,612
Who can tell us
about these markings?

406
00:35:56,864 --> 00:35:59,283
Perhaps a man I know
can help us.

407
00:36:01,452 --> 00:36:03,079
Indy...

408
00:36:04,622 --> 00:36:06,874
there is something
that troubles me.

409
00:36:07,041 --> 00:36:10,002
What is it?

410
00:36:10,127 --> 00:36:12,129
The Ark.

411
00:36:12,213 --> 00:36:14,507
If it is there, at Tanis,

412
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:17,885
then it is something that
man was not meant to disturb.

413
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:21,138
Death has always surrounded it.

414
00:36:21,222 --> 00:36:23,099
It is not of this earth.

415
00:36:23,558 --> 00:36:24,934
Do we need the monkey, huh?

416
00:36:25,059 --> 00:36:26,519
I'm surprised at you, Jones,

417
00:36:26,602 --> 00:36:29,230
talking that way about our baby.

418
00:36:29,438 --> 00:36:31,023
He's got your looks, too.

419
00:36:31,107 --> 00:36:32,108
And your brains.

420
00:36:32,191 --> 00:36:34,026
Oops!

421
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:35,194
I noticed that.

422
00:36:35,278 --> 00:36:37,822
She's a smart little thing.
Smart.

423
00:36:40,533 --> 00:36:41,742
Hey!

424
00:36:41,826 --> 00:36:43,035
Hey, where you going?

425
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:44,912
She'll be all right.
Have a date.

426
00:36:48,833 --> 00:36:49,959
Come on. Come on.

427
00:36:50,042 --> 00:36:51,961
- Okay...
- Marion.

428
00:36:52,044 --> 00:36:53,045
What's this?

429
00:36:53,129 --> 00:36:54,463
It's a date.

430
00:36:54,547 --> 00:36:55,756
You eat 'em.

431
00:37:44,805 --> 00:37:47,183
How come you haven't found some
nice girl to settle down with,

432
00:37:47,266 --> 00:37:49,143
raise eight or nine kids,
like your friend Sallah?

433
00:37:49,226 --> 00:37:50,394
Who says I haven't?

434
00:37:52,188 --> 00:37:53,272
I do.

435
00:37:53,397 --> 00:37:55,191
Dad had you figured
a long time ago.

436
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,077
He said you were a bum.

437
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,495
Oh, he's being generous.

438
00:38:07,578 --> 00:38:09,580
The most gifted bum
he ever trained.

439
00:38:09,914 --> 00:38:11,791
You know, he loved you
like a son.

440
00:38:11,874 --> 00:38:13,417
Took a hell of a lot
for you to alienate him.

441
00:38:13,542 --> 00:38:14,710
Not much, just you.

442
00:38:32,895 --> 00:38:34,188
Marion, get out of here!

443
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:35,731
Duck!

444
00:39:17,648 --> 00:39:18,899
Right.

445
00:40:01,192 --> 00:40:03,444
Shh! Shh!

446
00:40:09,492 --> 00:40:10,993
Marion!

447
00:40:30,971 --> 00:40:33,516
Help! Over here, Indy!

448
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:34,642
Get out of the way!

449
00:40:34,725 --> 00:40:36,185
Move! Move it!

450
00:40:37,436 --> 00:40:38,521
Help me!

451
00:40:44,235 --> 00:40:45,528
You can't do this to me!

452
00:40:45,611 --> 00:40:47,279
I'm an American!

453
00:40:47,363 --> 00:40:49,698
Indy!

454
00:40:52,535 --> 00:40:54,370
Indiana Jones!

455
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:55,955
Help me, Jones!

456
00:41:17,226 --> 00:41:18,394
Jones!

457
00:41:18,477 --> 00:41:19,478
Marion!

458
00:41:23,023 --> 00:41:25,192
Indy!

459
00:42:06,942 --> 00:42:08,360
Marion...

460
00:42:46,065 --> 00:42:47,149
Dr. Jones.

461
00:43:14,385 --> 00:43:15,719
You looking for me?

462
00:43:24,853 --> 00:43:26,063
Belloq.

463
00:43:26,146 --> 00:43:27,773
Good afternoon, Dr. Jones.

464
00:43:27,856 --> 00:43:29,733
I ought to kill you right now.

465
00:43:29,817 --> 00:43:32,444
Not a very private place
for a murder.

466
00:43:33,445 --> 00:43:36,198
Well, these Arabs don't care
if we kill each other.

467
00:43:36,282 --> 00:43:39,493
They're not going
to interfere in our business.

468
00:43:39,576 --> 00:43:42,121
It was not I who brought
the girl into this business.

469
00:43:42,246 --> 00:43:44,331
Please, sit down
before you fall down.

470
00:43:44,415 --> 00:43:47,042
We can at least behave
like civilized people.

471
00:43:58,387 --> 00:44:00,389
I see your taste in friends
remains consistent.

472
00:44:01,473 --> 00:44:03,392
How odd that it should end
this way for us,

473
00:44:03,475 --> 00:44:06,395
after so many
stimulating encounters.

474
00:44:06,562 --> 00:44:08,355
I almost regret it.

475
00:44:08,564 --> 00:44:09,982
Where shall I find
a new adversary

476
00:44:10,065 --> 00:44:11,734
so close to my own level?

477
00:44:11,859 --> 00:44:13,861
Try the local sewer.

478
00:44:16,447 --> 00:44:19,658
You and I are very much alike.

479
00:44:19,742 --> 00:44:22,077
Archeology is our religion,

480
00:44:22,161 --> 00:44:26,332
yet we have both fallen
from the purer faith.

481
00:44:26,415 --> 00:44:30,002
Our methods have not differed
as much as you pretend.

482
00:44:30,085 --> 00:44:33,255
I am a shadowy
reflection of you.

483
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:36,467
It would take only a nudge
to make you like me,

484
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:38,844
to push you out of the light.

485
00:44:38,927 --> 00:44:42,348
Now you're getting nasty.

486
00:44:42,431 --> 00:44:44,391
You know it's true.

487
00:44:44,475 --> 00:44:46,435
How nice.

488
00:44:46,518 --> 00:44:48,520
Look at this.

489
00:44:48,604 --> 00:44:50,439
It's worthless.

490
00:44:50,522 --> 00:44:52,733
Ten dollars
from a vendor in the street.

491
00:44:52,816 --> 00:44:53,942
But I take it,

492
00:44:54,026 --> 00:44:55,694
I bury it in the sand
for a thousand years,

493
00:44:55,778 --> 00:44:59,365
it becomes priceless...
Like the Ark.

494
00:44:59,448 --> 00:45:01,325
Men will kill for it.

495
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:04,119
Men like you and me.

496
00:45:04,286 --> 00:45:07,706
What about your boss,
der Fuhrer?

497
00:45:07,790 --> 00:45:11,210
I thought he was waiting
to take possession.

498
00:45:11,293 --> 00:45:13,837
All in good time.

499
00:45:13,921 --> 00:45:15,964
When I am finished with it.

500
00:45:16,048 --> 00:45:19,676
Jones, do you realize
what the Ark is?

501
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,637
It's a transmitter.

502
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:24,515
It's a radio
for speaking to God.

503
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,266
And it's within my reach.

504
00:45:28,185 --> 00:45:31,730
You want to talk to God?

505
00:45:31,814 --> 00:45:33,857
Let's go see Him together.

506
00:45:33,941 --> 00:45:35,567
I've got nothing better to do.

507
00:45:36,944 --> 00:45:38,779
Uncle Indy, come back home now!

508
00:45:40,989 --> 00:45:41,990
Uncle Indy!

509
00:45:43,659 --> 00:45:45,119
Next time, Indiana Jones,

510
00:45:45,244 --> 00:45:47,329
it'll take more than children
to save you.

511
00:45:49,415 --> 00:45:50,582
Uncle Indy!

512
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:06,265
I thought I would
find you there.

513
00:46:06,348 --> 00:46:08,600
Better than the United
States Marines, eh?

514
00:46:18,861 --> 00:46:20,028
Marion's dead.

515
00:46:20,112 --> 00:46:22,531
- Yes, I know.
- And me! And me!

516
00:46:22,656 --> 00:46:24,241
I'm sorry.

517
00:46:24,908 --> 00:46:26,910
Life goes on, Indy.

518
00:46:26,994 --> 00:46:28,704
There is the proof.

519
00:46:30,038 --> 00:46:31,165
Uh-oh.

520
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,917
I have much to tell you.

521
00:46:34,001 --> 00:46:36,253
First we will take them home,

522
00:46:36,336 --> 00:46:37,629
and then I will take you
to the old man.

523
00:47:28,931 --> 00:47:31,058
I can't figure out
how Belloq did it.

524
00:47:31,141 --> 00:47:33,560
Where'd he get a copy
of the headpiece?

525
00:47:33,644 --> 00:47:36,897
There are no pictures,
no duplicates of it anywhere.

526
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:39,399
I tell you only what I saw
with my own eyes:

527
00:47:39,483 --> 00:47:41,068
A headpiece like that one,

528
00:47:41,151 --> 00:47:43,654
except round the edges,
which were rougher.

529
00:47:43,737 --> 00:47:45,781
In the center, the Frenchman
had embedded a crystal,

530
00:47:45,864 --> 00:47:50,285
and... and surrounding
the crystal, on one side,

531
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:52,454
there were raised markings,
just like that one.

532
00:47:54,957 --> 00:47:57,209
They made their calculations
in the map room?

533
00:47:57,292 --> 00:47:58,669
This morning.

534
00:47:58,752 --> 00:48:01,129
Belloq and the boss German,
Dietrich.

535
00:48:02,464 --> 00:48:03,799
When they came out
of the map room,

536
00:48:03,882 --> 00:48:06,134
they gave us a new spot
in which to dig,

537
00:48:06,218 --> 00:48:08,971
out away from the camp.

538
00:48:09,304 --> 00:48:11,014
The Well of the Souls, huh?

539
00:48:11,098 --> 00:48:14,935
Come, come, look.
Look here... Look.

540
00:48:15,018 --> 00:48:16,562
Sit down.

541
00:48:16,645 --> 00:48:18,146
Come, sit down.

542
00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:20,482
What is it?

543
00:48:20,566 --> 00:48:22,401
This is a warning

544
00:48:22,484 --> 00:48:24,903
not to disturb
the Ark of the Covenant.

545
00:48:24,987 --> 00:48:26,822
What about the height
of the staff, though?

546
00:48:26,905 --> 00:48:28,073
Did Belloq get it off of here?

547
00:48:28,156 --> 00:48:30,242
Yes. It is here.

548
00:48:30,325 --> 00:48:32,119
This were the old way,

549
00:48:32,202 --> 00:48:34,663
this mean six kadam high.

550
00:48:34,746 --> 00:48:35,956
- About 72 inches.
- Wait!

551
00:48:39,501 --> 00:48:42,337
"And take back one kadam

552
00:48:42,421 --> 00:48:46,341
to honor the Hebrew God
whose Ark this is."

553
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:00,439
You said their headpiece
only had markings on one side.

554
00:49:00,522 --> 00:49:02,441
Are you absolutely sure?

555
00:49:04,109 --> 00:49:05,819
Belloq's staff is too long.

556
00:49:06,570 --> 00:49:08,572
They're digging
in the wrong place.

557
00:49:11,116 --> 00:49:13,785
I am the monarch of the sea

558
00:49:13,869 --> 00:49:15,746
I am the ruler of the...

559
00:49:26,632 --> 00:49:28,342
Bad dates.

560
00:49:43,649 --> 00:49:45,609
I told you not to be premature

561
00:49:45,692 --> 00:49:47,986
in your communiqué to Berlin.

562
00:49:48,070 --> 00:49:51,907
Archeology is not
an exact science.

563
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:54,159
It does not deal
in time schedules.

564
00:49:54,242 --> 00:49:55,869
The Fuhrer is not
a patient man.

565
00:49:55,952 --> 00:49:59,164
He demands constant reports,
and he expects progress.

566
00:49:59,247 --> 00:50:00,332
You led me to believe...

567
00:50:00,415 --> 00:50:02,209
Nothing!
I made no promises.

568
00:50:02,292 --> 00:50:04,503
I only said
it looked very favorable.

569
00:50:04,586 --> 00:50:07,589
Besides, with the information
in our possession,

570
00:50:07,673 --> 00:50:09,257
my calculations were correct.

571
00:50:09,675 --> 00:50:11,551
Boy, they're not kidding,
are they?

572
00:50:13,136 --> 00:50:15,347
What time does the sun
hit the map room?

573
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:17,391
At about 9:00 in the morning.

574
00:50:17,474 --> 00:50:19,267
Not much time, then.

575
00:50:19,351 --> 00:50:21,436
Where are they digging
for the Well of the Souls?

576
00:50:21,603 --> 00:50:24,648
On that ridge...
but the map room's over there.

577
00:50:24,731 --> 00:50:26,066
Let's go, come on.

578
00:54:32,437 --> 00:54:34,022
Sallah.

579
00:54:35,357 --> 00:54:37,108
Sallah!

580
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:46,034
They're here.

581
00:54:57,045 --> 00:54:58,254
Please, my friend,
what is the matter?

582
00:54:58,338 --> 00:55:00,048
I fetch the water.
I shall get it for you.

583
00:55:03,218 --> 00:55:04,386
If you want water,
I will get you water.

584
00:55:04,469 --> 00:55:05,762
No problem, no problem.

585
00:55:20,568 --> 00:55:22,153
I thought you were dead.

586
00:55:22,237 --> 00:55:23,738
You must have switched baskets.

587
00:55:28,201 --> 00:55:29,202
Are you hurt?

588
00:55:29,369 --> 00:55:31,663
No. You have to get me
out of here, quick.

589
00:55:31,746 --> 00:55:33,707
They're gonna be back
at any minute.

590
00:55:33,790 --> 00:55:35,291
Cut me loose.

591
00:55:35,375 --> 00:55:36,376
Quick.

592
00:55:36,459 --> 00:55:39,004
They keep asking about you.
What you know.

593
00:55:43,675 --> 00:55:45,010
What's wrong?

594
00:55:45,093 --> 00:55:46,177
Cut me loose.

595
00:55:46,261 --> 00:55:47,595
I know where the Ark is, Marion.

596
00:55:47,721 --> 00:55:48,763
The Ark's here?

597
00:55:49,889 --> 00:55:51,516
I'm coming with you, Jones.
Get me out of here!

598
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:52,934
Cut me loose!
You can't leave me here!

599
00:55:53,018 --> 00:55:54,060
If I take you out of here now,

600
00:55:54,144 --> 00:55:55,603
they'll start combing
the place for us.

601
00:55:55,770 --> 00:55:57,188
Jones, you've got to get me
out of here!

602
00:55:57,272 --> 00:55:59,649
Come on, Jones, are you crazy?

603
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,860
Marion, I hate to do this,

604
00:56:01,943 --> 00:56:04,529
but if you don't sit
still and keep quiet,

605
00:56:04,612 --> 00:56:06,698
this whole thing
is going to be shot.

606
00:56:07,949 --> 00:56:09,367
I'll be back to get you.

607
00:56:09,868 --> 00:56:11,327
Jones, what's the matter?

608
00:56:56,998 --> 00:56:58,625
That's it.

609
00:56:59,459 --> 00:57:00,460
Who knows?

610
00:57:00,543 --> 00:57:02,253
Perhaps the Ark is still waiting

611
00:57:02,337 --> 00:57:05,090
in some antechamber
for us to discover.

612
00:57:05,173 --> 00:57:08,384
Perhaps there's some vital
bit of evidence which eludes us.

613
00:57:08,468 --> 00:57:10,929
- Perhaps...
- Perhaps the girl can help us.

614
00:57:11,054 --> 00:57:12,388
My feeling exactly.

615
00:57:12,639 --> 00:57:14,891
She was in possession
of the original piece for years.

616
00:57:15,016 --> 00:57:17,685
She may know much,
if properly motivated.

617
00:57:18,478 --> 00:57:20,105
I tell you,
the girl knows nothing.

618
00:57:21,356 --> 00:57:23,066
I'm surprised
to find you squeamish.

619
00:57:23,149 --> 00:57:25,110
That is not your reputation.

620
00:57:25,193 --> 00:57:26,486
But it needn't concern you.

621
00:57:26,569 --> 00:57:28,780
I have the perfect man
for this kind of work.

622
00:57:34,452 --> 00:57:35,870
Heil Hitler.

623
00:58:58,620 --> 00:58:59,871
Indy! Here!

624
00:58:59,954 --> 00:59:01,331
We've hit stone!

625
00:59:05,793 --> 00:59:07,212
Clear it off.

626
00:59:07,295 --> 00:59:08,671
Come on, find the edges.

627
00:59:25,146 --> 00:59:26,773
Good, good, good.

628
00:59:26,856 --> 00:59:28,149
You see, Indy? You see?

629
00:59:28,233 --> 00:59:30,151
Okay, bring the pry bars in.

630
00:59:30,318 --> 00:59:31,903
As a team, boys! As a team!

631
00:59:33,988 --> 00:59:35,114
Push!

632
00:59:40,078 --> 00:59:41,913
Get 'em in there.
Get 'em under.

633
00:59:41,996 --> 00:59:43,206
Good, good, that's it.

634
00:59:43,623 --> 00:59:44,707
Watch your toes.

635
00:59:52,548 --> 00:59:53,758
Carefully, carefully!

636
01:00:06,187 --> 01:00:07,814
Sorry, Indy.

637
01:00:09,399 --> 01:00:10,733
Indy...

638
01:00:11,109 --> 01:00:13,027
why does the floor move?

639
01:00:15,196 --> 01:00:16,823
Give me your torch.

640
01:00:47,353 --> 01:00:49,272
Snakes.

641
01:00:49,355 --> 01:00:51,316
Why did it have to be snakes?

642
01:00:54,694 --> 01:00:57,155
Asps.

643
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:00,074
Very dangerous.

644
01:01:00,158 --> 01:01:01,576
You go first.

645
01:01:21,262 --> 01:01:23,056
If you're trying
to escape on foot,

646
01:01:23,139 --> 01:01:26,059
the desert is three weeks
in every direction,

647
01:01:26,142 --> 01:01:28,061
so please, eat something.

648
01:01:35,109 --> 01:01:37,111
I must apologize
for their treatment of you.

649
01:01:37,236 --> 01:01:38,404
Yeah. Whose idea was it?

650
01:01:38,488 --> 01:01:39,614
No food, no water.

651
01:01:39,739 --> 01:01:42,158
What kind of people
are these friends of yours?

652
01:01:42,241 --> 01:01:44,535
At this particular time
and place, to do my work,

653
01:01:44,619 --> 01:01:46,621
they are necessary evils.

654
01:01:46,704 --> 01:01:48,331
They're not my friends.

655
01:01:48,414 --> 01:01:51,250
However, with the
right connections,

656
01:01:51,334 --> 01:01:52,710
even in this part of the world,

657
01:01:52,835 --> 01:01:55,922
we are not entirely uncivilized.

658
01:01:57,590 --> 01:01:58,591
It's beautiful.

659
01:01:59,342 --> 01:02:01,552
I would very much like
to see you in it.

660
01:02:04,138 --> 01:02:05,765
I'll bet you would.

661
01:02:10,353 --> 01:02:11,979
All right.

662
01:02:19,987 --> 01:02:21,489
What do you got to drink
around here?

663
01:02:24,575 --> 01:02:26,744
We don't have much time.

664
01:02:26,828 --> 01:02:28,579
Soon they will come to harm you,

665
01:02:28,663 --> 01:02:30,748
and I will not be able
to stop them,

666
01:02:30,832 --> 01:02:33,501
unless you are able
to give me something

667
01:02:33,584 --> 01:02:35,503
to placate them.

668
01:02:35,586 --> 01:02:39,173
Some, uh, piece
of information...

669
01:02:39,257 --> 01:02:41,300
which I can use
to protect you from them.

670
01:02:41,843 --> 01:02:44,095
I've already told you
everything I know.

671
01:02:44,178 --> 01:02:46,597
I have no loyalty to Jones.

672
01:02:46,681 --> 01:02:48,808
He's brought me
nothing but trouble.

673
01:02:55,690 --> 01:02:57,191
Marion, you are beautiful.

674
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:04,365
I don't think
we need a chaperone.

675
01:03:08,995 --> 01:03:10,455
Steadily.

676
01:03:10,538 --> 01:03:11,956
Steadily. Whoa!

677
01:03:14,542 --> 01:03:15,668
Down...

678
01:03:15,918 --> 01:03:17,003
Down... Whoa.

679
01:03:17,086 --> 01:03:18,212
Carefully, carefully!

680
01:03:19,046 --> 01:03:20,298
You all right, Indy?

681
01:03:23,426 --> 01:03:26,721
Now gently, boys.
Gently, gently!

682
01:03:35,271 --> 01:03:36,272
Whoa...

683
01:03:46,991 --> 01:03:48,326
I told you it will be all right.

684
01:04:04,717 --> 01:04:06,260
Huh...

685
01:04:14,769 --> 01:04:16,395
Sallah, get down here!

686
01:04:36,082 --> 01:04:37,625
You pour.

687
01:06:31,322 --> 01:06:32,948
Oh, that's good.

688
01:06:36,285 --> 01:06:37,453
Whoops.

689
01:06:43,793 --> 01:06:45,503
What is this stuff, René?

690
01:06:46,879 --> 01:06:48,381
I grew up with this.

691
01:06:50,216 --> 01:06:51,717
It's my family label.

692
01:07:21,288 --> 01:07:24,667
Well... I have to be
going now, René.

693
01:07:27,253 --> 01:07:29,130
I like you, René, very much.

694
01:07:29,797 --> 01:07:32,466
Perhaps we'll meet someday
under better circumstances.

695
01:07:37,263 --> 01:07:38,973
We meet again, Fréulein.

696
01:07:40,474 --> 01:07:42,476
You Americans,
you're all the same.

697
01:07:44,895 --> 01:07:47,440
Always overdressing
for the wrong occasions.

698
01:08:19,013 --> 01:08:20,806
Now...

699
01:08:23,559 --> 01:08:25,686
what shall we talk about?

700
01:09:43,931 --> 01:09:46,392
All right... take it up!

701
01:09:46,725 --> 01:09:48,227
Easy!

702
01:09:50,104 --> 01:09:51,814
You're as stubborn as that girl.

703
01:09:52,106 --> 01:09:54,775
You like her too much, I think.

704
01:09:54,859 --> 01:09:58,195
Your methods of archeology
are too primitive for me.

705
01:09:58,279 --> 01:10:03,117
You would use a bulldozer
to find a... china cup.

706
01:10:08,247 --> 01:10:10,040
Colonel! Wake your men!

707
01:10:10,165 --> 01:10:12,126
Indy, the torches
are burning out.

708
01:10:12,209 --> 01:10:14,128
Go on, get out of here.

709
01:10:14,295 --> 01:10:15,963
Hyah!

710
01:10:34,398 --> 01:10:35,983
- Sallah!
- Hello!

711
01:10:37,151 --> 01:10:38,235
Hello!

712
01:10:38,944 --> 01:10:41,238
Why, Dr. Jones,
whatever are you doing

713
01:10:41,322 --> 01:10:43,198
in such a nasty place?

714
01:10:43,324 --> 01:10:45,367
Why don't you come on down here!
I'll show you!

715
01:10:45,451 --> 01:10:46,452
Thank you, my friend,

716
01:10:46,535 --> 01:10:49,413
but I think we are all
very comfortable up here.

717
01:10:49,496 --> 01:10:50,956
That's right, isn't it?

718
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:53,792
Yes, we are very comfortable
up here.

719
01:10:55,210 --> 01:10:57,171
So, once again, Jones,

720
01:10:57,296 --> 01:10:59,548
what was briefly yours
is now mine.

721
01:11:00,841 --> 01:11:03,802
What a fitting end
to your life's pursuits.

722
01:11:03,886 --> 01:11:05,763
You're about to become
a permanent addition

723
01:11:05,846 --> 01:11:07,139
to this archeological find.

724
01:11:07,264 --> 01:11:08,557
Who knows?

725
01:11:08,641 --> 01:11:10,726
In a thousand years,
even you may be worth something.

726
01:11:13,354 --> 01:11:14,605
Son of a bitch.

727
01:11:14,688 --> 01:11:16,607
I'm afraid we must be
going now, Dr. Jones.

728
01:11:16,690 --> 01:11:19,026
Our prize is awaited in Berlin.

729
01:11:19,234 --> 01:11:20,444
But I do not wish to leave you

730
01:11:20,527 --> 01:11:22,947
down in that awful place
all alone.

731
01:11:23,030 --> 01:11:24,865
Slimy pig, you let me go!

732
01:11:25,783 --> 01:11:26,867
Stop it!

733
01:11:29,411 --> 01:11:30,955
Marion!

734
01:11:31,538 --> 01:11:32,539
Hang on.

735
01:11:33,374 --> 01:11:34,458
Don't...

736
01:11:34,792 --> 01:11:35,834
- Indy!
- Don't fall!

737
01:11:35,918 --> 01:11:37,920
Marion, I got you!
I got you! I got you!

738
01:11:42,257 --> 01:11:44,385
You traitor!
You get your hands off of me!

739
01:11:52,518 --> 01:11:53,602
Snakes!

740
01:11:54,979 --> 01:11:57,022
Oh, sh... oh, at your feet!

741
01:11:58,273 --> 01:11:59,441
The girl was mine!

742
01:11:59,525 --> 01:12:00,484
She's of no use to us.

743
01:12:00,567 --> 01:12:02,277
Only our mission
for the Fuhrer matters.

744
01:12:05,447 --> 01:12:06,824
I wonder sometimes, monsieur,

745
01:12:06,907 --> 01:12:09,243
if you have that
clearly in mind.

746
01:12:09,451 --> 01:12:11,412
It was not to be, chérie.

747
01:12:12,037 --> 01:12:14,123
You bastards!
I'll get you for this!

748
01:12:14,373 --> 01:12:16,917
Indiana Jones...

749
01:12:17,001 --> 01:12:18,002
adieu.

750
01:12:31,098 --> 01:12:32,516
No!

751
01:12:42,026 --> 01:12:43,110
Take this.

752
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:45,070
Wave it at anything
that slithers.

753
01:12:45,154 --> 01:12:46,321
Thank you.

754
01:12:46,405 --> 01:12:48,741
Oh, my God, this whole
place is slithering.

755
01:12:51,785 --> 01:12:52,870
Indy!

756
01:12:52,953 --> 01:12:54,455
Ow! Jesus!

757
01:12:58,125 --> 01:12:59,793
Where did you get this?
From him?

758
01:12:59,918 --> 01:13:01,336
I was trying to escape.

759
01:13:01,420 --> 01:13:02,588
No thanks to you.

760
01:13:02,671 --> 01:13:03,964
How hard were you trying?

761
01:13:04,089 --> 01:13:05,215
Well, where the hell were you?

762
01:13:05,299 --> 01:13:06,383
Watch it, watch it.

763
01:13:06,467 --> 01:13:09,470
- What are you doing?
- For the fire!

764
01:13:11,638 --> 01:13:13,223
How the hell are we going
to get out of here?

765
01:13:13,307 --> 01:13:14,433
I'm working on it!
I'm working on it!

766
01:13:14,516 --> 01:13:16,268
Well, whatever you're
doing, do it faster.

767
01:13:20,606 --> 01:13:21,982
Ah...

768
01:13:22,483 --> 01:13:23,817
Where are you going?

769
01:13:23,942 --> 01:13:25,360
Through that wall.

770
01:13:26,028 --> 01:13:27,988
Just get ready to run,
whatever happens to me.

771
01:13:28,322 --> 01:13:29,948
What do you mean by that?

772
01:13:42,002 --> 01:13:43,504
Indy!

773
01:13:44,046 --> 01:13:46,507
Damn it! Don't you leave me
down here by myself!

774
01:14:11,198 --> 01:14:12,950
Indy!

775
01:14:13,033 --> 01:14:14,201
Here we go!

776
01:14:14,284 --> 01:14:15,452
Get ready!

777
01:14:15,536 --> 01:14:19,414
Indy, the torch is going out!

778
01:15:00,289 --> 01:15:01,623
Indy?

779
01:15:21,977 --> 01:15:23,687
Marion!

780
01:15:23,770 --> 01:15:26,023
Look. Look.

781
01:16:04,895 --> 01:16:07,272
They're going to fly it
out of here.

782
01:16:07,356 --> 01:16:08,482
When that Ark gets loaded,

783
01:16:08,565 --> 01:16:09,942
we're already going
to be on the plane.

784
01:16:14,571 --> 01:16:18,533
Ah, monsieur, let us toast
our success in the desert.

785
01:16:18,617 --> 01:16:19,785
To the Ark.

786
01:16:19,868 --> 01:16:21,828
When we are very far
from here.

787
01:16:21,912 --> 01:16:23,622
That Will do.

788
01:17:15,882 --> 01:17:20,262
Hey, you now... Come here!

789
01:17:20,345 --> 01:17:21,805
Come here!

790
01:18:27,079 --> 01:18:28,372
Indy!

791
01:19:19,423 --> 01:19:21,508
Stay with the Ark!
Stay with the Ark!

792
01:19:27,180 --> 01:19:28,515
Look out!

793
01:19:38,859 --> 01:19:40,193
Oh, my God.

794
01:19:40,277 --> 01:19:41,445
Marion.

795
01:19:41,528 --> 01:19:44,197
In here! Up here!

796
01:19:46,616 --> 01:19:47,659
Indy, come on!

797
01:19:47,742 --> 01:19:48,827
Pull on the latch!

798
01:19:48,910 --> 01:19:50,912
Move up!
It's gonna blow up!

799
01:19:53,373 --> 01:19:56,293
It's stuck! Indy!

800
01:19:57,252 --> 01:19:58,837
I can't force the lock!

801
01:20:28,408 --> 01:20:29,576
It's stuck!

802
01:20:29,659 --> 01:20:31,077
- Turn it! Turn it!
- It's stuck!

803
01:20:31,161 --> 01:20:32,287
Turn it there!

804
01:20:32,370 --> 01:20:33,997
Never mind!
Get back! Get back!

805
01:20:55,393 --> 01:20:57,437
Get the Ark away from
this place immediately.

806
01:20:57,521 --> 01:20:59,189
Have it put on the truck.

807
01:20:59,272 --> 01:21:01,191
We'll fly it out of Cairo.

808
01:21:01,274 --> 01:21:04,110
And Gobler, I want
plenty of protection.

809
01:21:10,784 --> 01:21:12,494
Jones.

810
01:21:17,791 --> 01:21:19,334
Holy smoke, my friends,

811
01:21:19,417 --> 01:21:21,461
I... I'm so pleased
you're not dead!

812
01:21:23,296 --> 01:21:24,756
Indy, Indy, we have no time.

813
01:21:24,839 --> 01:21:26,216
If you still want the Ark,

814
01:21:26,299 --> 01:21:28,677
it is being loaded
onto a truck for Cairo.

815
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:30,595
Truck?

816
01:21:30,679 --> 01:21:31,930
What truck?

817
01:21:59,541 --> 01:22:00,834
Let's go!

818
01:22:09,342 --> 01:22:10,802
Get back to Cairo.

819
01:22:10,885 --> 01:22:12,971
Get us some transport
to England...

820
01:22:13,054 --> 01:22:16,016
boat, plane, anything.

821
01:22:16,099 --> 01:22:18,310
Meet me at Omar's.
Be ready for me.

822
01:22:18,393 --> 01:22:19,477
I'm going after that truck.

823
01:22:19,561 --> 01:22:21,104
- How?
- I don't know.

824
01:22:21,187 --> 01:22:22,439
I'm making this up as I go.

825
01:26:00,031 --> 01:26:01,241
Ew!

826
01:28:23,841 --> 01:28:24,842
He's there!

827
01:29:16,811 --> 01:29:18,396
Idiot! Idiot!

828
01:30:04,317 --> 01:30:06,152
Everything at last
has been arranged.

829
01:30:06,235 --> 01:30:07,779
- The Ark?
-ls on board.

830
01:30:07,862 --> 01:30:09,530
Nothing is lacking,
now that you're here.

831
01:30:09,655 --> 01:30:10,907
Or what is left of you.

832
01:30:10,990 --> 01:30:13,451
- You trust these guys?
- Yes.

833
01:30:15,161 --> 01:30:16,913
Mr. Katanga.

834
01:30:20,416 --> 01:30:22,585
Mr. Katanga,
these are my friends.

835
01:30:23,252 --> 01:30:25,088
They are my family.

836
01:30:25,171 --> 01:30:28,257
I will hear of it
if they are not treated well.

837
01:30:28,341 --> 01:30:30,760
My cabin is theirs.

838
01:30:30,843 --> 01:30:32,845
Mr. Jones...

839
01:30:32,929 --> 01:30:35,431
I've heard a lot about you, sir.

840
01:30:35,515 --> 01:30:37,892
Your appearance is exactly
the way I imagined.

841
01:30:43,147 --> 01:30:44,857
Good-bye.

842
01:30:47,193 --> 01:30:48,986
Look after each other.

843
01:30:49,320 --> 01:30:51,114
I am already missing you.

844
01:30:53,658 --> 01:30:55,159
You're my good friend.

845
01:30:57,829 --> 01:30:59,247
Sallah.

846
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:04,544
That is for Fayah...

847
01:31:06,254 --> 01:31:07,755
that is for your children...

848
01:31:07,839 --> 01:31:10,258
and this is for you.

849
01:31:14,887 --> 01:31:16,222
Thank you.

850
01:31:25,523 --> 01:31:30,736
A British tar is a soaring soul

851
01:31:30,903 --> 01:31:34,824
As free as a mountain bird

852
01:31:35,199 --> 01:31:39,120
His energetic fist
should be ready to...

853
01:31:40,746 --> 01:31:43,207
...a dictator...

854
01:31:49,964 --> 01:31:51,257
Where did you go?

855
01:31:52,049 --> 01:31:53,134
I'm cleaning up.

856
01:31:54,510 --> 01:31:56,429
Where'd you get that?

857
01:31:56,888 --> 01:31:57,972
From him.

858
01:31:58,055 --> 01:31:59,307
Who him?

859
01:31:59,390 --> 01:32:00,433
Katanga.

860
01:32:00,516 --> 01:32:01,809
I got a feeling
I'm not the first woman

861
01:32:01,934 --> 01:32:04,020
ever to travel
with these pirates.

862
01:32:04,103 --> 01:32:06,355
It's lovely.

863
01:32:06,439 --> 01:32:07,523
Yeah?

864
01:32:07,607 --> 01:32:08,608
Yeah.

865
01:32:08,691 --> 01:32:09,734
Really?

866
01:32:09,817 --> 01:32:11,110
Yeah.

867
01:32:22,455 --> 01:32:23,748
What'd you say?

868
01:32:30,379 --> 01:32:32,423
Wait... I don't need any help.

869
01:32:33,257 --> 01:32:35,301
You know you do.

870
01:32:37,303 --> 01:32:39,764
You're not the man
I knew ten years ago.

871
01:32:39,847 --> 01:32:43,267
It's not the years, honey,
it's the mileage.

872
01:32:48,481 --> 01:32:50,441
You are...

873
01:32:51,484 --> 01:32:53,027
Please, I don't need a nurse.

874
01:32:53,152 --> 01:32:54,570
- I just want to sleep.
- Don't be such a baby.

875
01:32:54,654 --> 01:32:55,821
Marion, leave me alone.

876
01:32:55,905 --> 01:32:57,031
- What is this here?
- Go away.

877
01:32:57,156 --> 01:32:59,617
Yes, it hurts.

878
01:32:59,700 --> 01:33:00,743
Ow!

879
01:33:00,826 --> 01:33:04,288
Well, goddamn it, Indy,
where doesn't it hurt?

880
01:33:04,372 --> 01:33:06,165
Here.

881
01:33:12,004 --> 01:33:13,422
Here.

882
01:33:22,223 --> 01:33:23,849
This isn't too bad.

883
01:33:33,359 --> 01:33:34,360
Here.

884
01:33:55,548 --> 01:33:56,549
Jones...

885
01:33:59,385 --> 01:34:00,803
Jones?

886
01:34:03,639 --> 01:34:05,683
We never seem to get
a break, do we?

887
01:34:34,170 --> 01:34:35,171
What is it?

888
01:34:35,838 --> 01:34:38,132
Engines have stopped.
I'm going to go check.

889
01:34:49,435 --> 01:34:51,062
- What's happening?
- We have most important friends.

890
01:34:51,145 --> 01:34:52,813
Holy shit.

891
01:34:54,607 --> 01:34:56,776
I sent my man for you.
You and the girl must disappear.

892
01:34:56,859 --> 01:34:58,277
We have a place in the hold.
Come on, go, go, go.

893
01:34:58,361 --> 01:34:59,362
Come on, go, my friend, go.

894
01:35:13,167 --> 01:35:14,210
Where is Dr. Jones?

895
01:35:14,293 --> 01:35:15,628
What's the big idea?

896
01:35:15,795 --> 01:35:17,129
Let go!!

897
01:35:21,467 --> 01:35:23,302
Don't you touch me.

898
01:36:08,055 --> 01:36:09,682
What about Jones?

899
01:36:09,849 --> 01:36:11,350
There's no trace yet, sir.

900
01:36:11,434 --> 01:36:12,810
Jones is dead.

901
01:36:15,980 --> 01:36:17,189
I killed him.

902
01:36:18,357 --> 01:36:19,692
He was of no use to us.

903
01:36:20,443 --> 01:36:23,195
This girl, however, has certain
value where we're headed.

904
01:36:23,988 --> 01:36:25,698
She'll bring a very good price.

905
01:36:26,949 --> 01:36:28,033
Mmm?

906
01:36:28,951 --> 01:36:33,038
Herr Colonel,
that cargo you've taken...

907
01:36:33,122 --> 01:36:34,707
If it's your goal,
go in peace with it,

908
01:36:34,790 --> 01:36:35,791
but leave us the girl.

909
01:36:35,875 --> 01:36:36,959
It would reduce our loss
on this trip.

910
01:36:37,042 --> 01:36:39,795
Savage!

911
01:36:39,879 --> 01:36:42,465
You are not in the position
to ask for anything.

912
01:36:42,548 --> 01:36:44,967
We will take what we wish.

913
01:36:45,050 --> 01:36:46,510
And then decide whether or not

914
01:36:46,594 --> 01:36:48,512
to blow your ship
from the water.

915
01:36:50,973 --> 01:36:52,391
The girl goes with me.

916
01:36:53,851 --> 01:36:55,102
She'll be part
of my compensation.

917
01:36:55,186 --> 01:36:58,189
I'm sure your Fuhrer
would approve.

918
01:36:58,272 --> 01:36:59,607
If she fails to please me,

919
01:36:59,690 --> 01:37:01,942
you may do with her as you wish.

920
01:37:02,026 --> 01:37:05,029
I will waste
no more time with her now.

921
01:37:05,112 --> 01:37:06,238
Excuse me.

922
01:37:22,338 --> 01:37:23,839
I can't find Mr. Jones, Captain.

923
01:37:23,923 --> 01:37:25,508
I've looked everywhere.

924
01:37:25,591 --> 01:37:28,010
He's got to be here somewhere.

925
01:37:28,093 --> 01:37:29,261
Look again.

926
01:37:31,430 --> 01:37:32,765
- I found him.
- Where?

927
01:37:33,057 --> 01:37:34,099
There.

928
01:40:00,621 --> 01:40:02,373
The altar has been
prepared in accordance

929
01:40:02,456 --> 01:40:03,832
with your radio instructions,
sir.

930
01:40:03,916 --> 01:40:04,958
Good.

931
01:40:05,084 --> 01:40:06,960
Take the Ark there immediately.

932
01:40:09,296 --> 01:40:11,048
Monsieur...

933
01:40:12,716 --> 01:40:14,677
I am uncomfortable
with the thought

934
01:40:14,760 --> 01:40:18,847
of this... Jewish ritual.

935
01:40:18,931 --> 01:40:21,475
Are you sure it's necessary?

936
01:40:21,558 --> 01:40:23,435
Let me ask you this:

937
01:40:23,686 --> 01:40:27,106
Would you be more comfortable
opening the Ark in Berlin,

938
01:40:27,398 --> 01:40:29,191
for your Fuhrer?

939
01:40:29,566 --> 01:40:30,818
Finding out, only then,

940
01:40:30,943 --> 01:40:33,654
if the sacred pieces
of the Covenant are inside?

941
01:40:33,821 --> 01:40:34,863
Knowing, only then,

942
01:40:34,947 --> 01:40:36,949
whether you have accomplished
your mission,

943
01:40:37,116 --> 01:40:39,910
and obtained the one true Ark?

944
01:42:08,707 --> 01:42:09,750
Hello!

945
01:42:12,544 --> 01:42:13,754
Jones.

946
01:42:15,047 --> 01:42:16,465
Jones!

947
01:42:16,590 --> 01:42:18,383
I'm going to blow up the Ark,
René.

948
01:42:24,973 --> 01:42:27,518
Your persistence
surprises even me.

949
01:42:29,228 --> 01:42:31,563
You're going to give
mercenaries a bad name.

950
01:42:31,730 --> 01:42:33,440
Dr. Jones...

951
01:42:36,235 --> 01:42:38,779
surely you don't think you can
escape from this island.

952
01:42:38,862 --> 01:42:41,240
That depends on how reasonable
we're all willing to be.

953
01:42:41,365 --> 01:42:42,741
All I want is the girl.

954
01:42:48,247 --> 01:42:49,790
If we refuse?

955
01:42:50,916 --> 01:42:53,085
Then your Fuhrer has no prize.

956
01:42:54,253 --> 01:42:55,337
Okay, stand back.

957
01:42:55,420 --> 01:42:56,672
All of you, stand back.

958
01:42:56,755 --> 01:42:58,382
Stand back.

959
01:42:58,549 --> 01:43:00,342
Okay, Jones.

960
01:43:00,425 --> 01:43:02,678
You win!

961
01:43:02,761 --> 01:43:04,221
Blow it up.

962
01:43:10,185 --> 01:43:13,480
Yes, blow it up!

963
01:43:13,564 --> 01:43:15,148
Blow it back to God.

964
01:43:16,275 --> 01:43:17,693
All your life has been spent

965
01:43:17,776 --> 01:43:20,362
in pursuit
of archeological relics.

966
01:43:20,445 --> 01:43:24,116
Inside the Ark are treasures
beyond your wildest aspirations.

967
01:43:25,033 --> 01:43:27,160
You want to see it open
as well as I.

968
01:43:29,288 --> 01:43:31,290
Indiana...

969
01:43:31,623 --> 01:43:34,126
we are simply passing
through history.

970
01:43:35,878 --> 01:43:37,045
This...

971
01:43:39,631 --> 01:43:41,300
This is history.

972
01:43:51,310 --> 01:43:52,978
Do as you will.

973
01:46:28,633 --> 01:46:30,427
Marion, don't look at it.

974
01:46:30,510 --> 01:46:31,636
Shut your eyes, Marion.

975
01:46:31,720 --> 01:46:33,221
Don't look at it,
no matter what happens.

976
01:46:44,983 --> 01:46:46,359
Ah...

977
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:03,668
It's beautiful!

978
01:47:14,554 --> 01:47:15,680
Indy?

979
01:47:15,764 --> 01:47:16,807
Don't look, Marion!

980
01:47:16,890 --> 01:47:18,141
Keep your eyes shut!

981
01:48:36,428 --> 01:48:37,596
Marion.

982
01:49:10,253 --> 01:49:13,715
You've done your country a
great service, and we thank you.

983
01:49:13,798 --> 01:49:17,552
And we trust you found
the settlement satisfactory.

984
01:49:17,636 --> 01:49:18,720
Oh, the money's fine.

985
01:49:18,803 --> 01:49:20,472
The situation's
totally unacceptable.

986
01:49:20,555 --> 01:49:22,891
Well, gentlemen,
I guess that just about wraps it up.

987
01:49:22,974 --> 01:49:26,895
Where is the Ark?

988
01:49:26,978 --> 01:49:28,647
I thought we'd settled that.

989
01:49:28,813 --> 01:49:31,441
The Ark is somewhere very safe.

990
01:49:31,524 --> 01:49:32,651
From whom?

991
01:49:32,776 --> 01:49:35,403
The Ark is a source
of unspeakable power

992
01:49:35,487 --> 01:49:37,322
and it has to be researched.

993
01:49:37,405 --> 01:49:40,617
And it will be,
I assure you, Dr. Brody,

994
01:49:40,700 --> 01:49:42,244
Dr. Jones.

995
01:49:42,327 --> 01:49:45,956
We have top men
working on it right now.

996
01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:48,250
Who?

997
01:49:49,793 --> 01:49:52,087
Top men.

998
01:49:55,298 --> 01:49:57,550
Hey, what happened?

999
01:49:57,676 --> 01:49:58,760
You don't look very happy.

1000
01:49:58,843 --> 01:50:01,680
- Fools. Bureaucratic fools.
- What'd they say?

1001
01:50:02,555 --> 01:50:04,349
They don't know
what they've got there.

1002
01:50:05,100 --> 01:50:07,060
Well, I know what I've got here.

1003
01:50:08,436 --> 01:50:09,688
Come on.

1004
01:50:10,063 --> 01:50:11,523
I'll buy you a drink.

1005
01:50:13,024 --> 01:50:14,776
You know...

1006
01:50:15,193 --> 01:50:16,820
a drink?
