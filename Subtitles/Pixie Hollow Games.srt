00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:48,381
Hut, hut, hut, hut, hut...

3
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,897
Right here will be just divine, thank you.

4
00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:07,108
Hut, hut, hut, hut.

5
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:17,660
Let's speed this along.

6
00:01:21,457 --> 00:01:22,582
There.

7
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:24,584
This is lovely.

8
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:27,378
Hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut.

9
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:28,921
What in Neverland...

10
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:31,591
Chloe! Chloe? Chloe!

11
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:33,217
Don't trample the flowers!

12
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:38,139
Dirt! Get it off, get it off,
get it off, get it off!

13
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:40,850
Oh, my goodness, Rosetta.
I am so sorry. Are you okay?

14
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:41,934
Get it...

15
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:44,771
Thank you.

16
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:48,107
You're afraid of dirt?
And you're a garden fairy?

17
00:01:48,192 --> 00:01:49,525
Ironic, isn't it?

18
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:53,237
I love your rock.
What are you doing with it?

19
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:54,530
I'm training.

20
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:56,115
Training?

21
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,242
For the Pixie Hollow Games, of course.

22
00:01:58,327 --> 00:02:00,578
I've been studying all kinds of
strategies for different events,

23
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:01,996
working really hard at ways to...

24
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,583
Wait, wait, wait. You actually want to be
on the garden fairy team?

25
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,376
Well, yeah. Don't you?

26
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:09,962
No. New arrival.

27
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:13,090
I'm starting to think I'm the only one
who wants to be on the team.

28
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:15,843
You are. Because we stink!

29
00:02:16,178 --> 00:02:18,721
We never even come close to winning.

30
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:22,225
We bring beauty to the world.
That's what we're good at.

31
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:26,354
Well, why can't garden fairies be
just as good as everyone else?

32
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:28,773
I mean, this could be the year
the losing streak ends.

33
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:31,901
It would make history.
And I, for one, think we can win!

34
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:35,863
We can win, if no one else shows up.

35
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:38,366
Gather around, garden fairies.

36
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:41,869
It is time to choose who's going to
represent us in the games this year.

37
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:43,996
Now, Chloe has already...

38
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:45,706
Dig down deep and break the streak!

39
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:49,585
Okay. But we need to pick
her teammate.

40
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:54,715
Now come on.
We've put this off long enough,

41
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,301
so let's just get this over with.

42
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,848
Thank you. And the name is...

43
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,600
Please don't let it be me! No, no, no...

44
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:05,810
Rosetta!

45
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:07,687
Me? No! No, no, no, no.

46
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:10,481
There must be some mistake!
Here, let me see that.

47
00:03:10,566 --> 00:03:13,234
See, that says Rosita.

48
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:17,864
Rosita, where are ya? Rosita!

49
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:19,031
It's you.

50
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:21,409
No, but I can't! Just pick another...

51
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,288
Yours is the only name in there.

52
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:26,372
What?

53
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:30,543
You've weaseled your way out of this
every single year, Ro. It's your turn.

54
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:31,711
Well, that's only because I...

55
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:33,045
Hey, you heard her.
She doesn't want to do it.

56
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,505
Are you sure there isn't anyone else?

57
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,425
Yeah! Well, yeah,
Fern, what about you?

58
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:41,387
I did it last year. Slipped in slug slime
and separated my septum.

59
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:42,722
Or Lilac?

60
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:45,224
I swallowed so much mud
on tug of war,

61
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:46,976
I sprouted weeds out my nose!

62
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,144
Or Ivy?

63
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,981
Trampled by my own frog.
Thanks for bringing it up!

64
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,484
- Rosetta!
- You made her cry!

65
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:56,652
Great job, Rosetta.

66
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,989
Fine, fine. I'll do it.

67
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:05,077
All right, so, let's bring home
that trophy. Dig down deep?

68
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:12,168
No, no, no.
Dig down deep and break the streak.

69
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:18,090
This is gonna be good.

70
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:26,098
<i>Aye, it's that time again, folks.</i>

71
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:28,976
<i>The games will span
the next three days,</i>

72
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:31,729
<i>with the last place team eliminated
after each event.</i>

73
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:34,106
<i>All leading up to the pixie car derby,</i>

74
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:37,777
<i>where the final four teams
will race for the championship.</i>

75
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:39,612
<i>And so, let the games...</i>

76
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:42,531
<i>Let the games begin!</i>

77
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:44,158
Clank, give a guy some warning.

78
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:47,370
Sorry, Bobble. I'm just so excited!

79
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:48,913
<i>Here come the teams!</i>

80
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:52,625
Fast-flying fairies, soar!

81
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,710
<i>The animal fairies!</i>

82
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:57,922
<i>Our very own tinker fairies!</i>

83
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:00,383
<i>The dust-keeper fairies!</i>

84
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,385
Dust-keeper pride!

85
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:03,970
Hey, Terence, nice legs!

86
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:06,639
<i>The music fairies!</i>

87
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,891
<i>The light fairies!</i>

88
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:11,394
<i>The garden fairies!</i>

89
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,481
<i>The art fairies!</i>

90
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,819
<i>The water fairies!</i>

91
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,073
<i>The scout fairies!</i>

92
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:27,910
What a beautiful dress, Rosetta!

93
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:31,747
You do know we're competing,
not spectating, right?

94
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,960
Honeydew, we're not gonna last
more than one event.

95
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:39,130
If I'm gonna look bad, I'm not gonna
look bad. Know what I mean?

96
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:40,297
Nope.

97
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:42,717
Don't worry.
We'll do a makeover on you later.

98
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,970
Yeah.

99
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,263
<i>Here they come,</i>

100
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:52,852
<i>your defending Pixie Hollow Games
champions, the storm fairies!</i>

101
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,896
Where there's lightning...

102
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:58,274
There's thunder!

103
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,609
Go, storm fairies!

104
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:02,528
<i>Rumble and Glimmer are going for</i>

105
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:06,157
<i>a record fifth straight
championship ring!</i>

106
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:07,700
One for the thumb!

107
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:11,996
One for the thumb! One for the thumb!

108
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,126
One for the thumb! One for the thumb!
They're my favorite!

109
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,086
Well, I'm glad you're so impartial.

110
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:21,088
Well, thank you very much, Bobble.

111
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:32,725
Welcome, fairies and sparrowmen,
to the Pixie Hollow Games.

112
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:37,480
Good luck to all our competitors!
And may the best team win.

113
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,127
<i>What a spectacular
opening ceremonies! it's going to be...</i>

114
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:03,964
Look, Bobble, the animal fairies
are bringing out the frogs!

115
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:08,928
<i>This is it, Clanky.
Time for our first event, leapfrogging!</i>

116
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,680
Are you ready, big guy?

117
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:19,105
<i>The first team to finish two laps
is the winner.</i>

118
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:21,857
<i>And these trusty toads are raring to go!</i>

119
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,194
<i>Teams, take your mark. Get set...</i>

120
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:29,323
<i>And they're off! Bolting to the lead
are the animal fairies.</i>

121
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:32,868
<i>Bobble, look, the garden team
is still at the starting line!</i>

122
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:36,580
Rosetta, you actually
have to sit on the frog.

123
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:40,459
I am not putting my petunia
on that slimy thing.

124
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:41,710
But the race has started!

125
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,546
I don't even wanna touch it!

126
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,464
- Please?
- I can't!

127
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:47,466
Sit on the frog!

128
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:50,177
All right, all right!

129
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:53,139
I'm just gonna hover.

130
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:54,557
Hold on!

131
00:07:58,061 --> 00:08:01,063
<i>The garden team seems to be having
a wee bit of trouble.</i>

132
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:04,024
<i>Well, perhaps they're waiting
for the right moment.</i>

133
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:05,484
Out of my way!

134
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:07,153
<i>They're not doing much of anything...</i>

135
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:10,406
<i>They've made a move.
Bobble, there's been a crash!</i>

136
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,158
<i>Clanky, look at the race, lad.</i>

137
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:14,660
<i>The storm and animal teams
are jockeying for the lead</i>

138
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:18,164
<i>as they come into the final stretch.
It's a dead heat.</i>

139
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:20,541
<i>And here they come!</i>

140
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,042
All right!

141
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:23,586
<i>The animal fairies win!</i>

142
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,755
What happened to my storm fairies?

143
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:30,342
- Yeah! Way to go, Buck!
- Yeah!

144
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:34,263
Rosetta! Hold on! Just a little further!

145
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:44,607
I knew you could do it!

146
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:48,152
Since the healing fairies didn't finish,
you guys move on to the next event!

147
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:53,115
Oh, my gosh! Are you serious?
Did you hear that, Ro? We're still in it!

148
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:57,244
<i>So, after one event, the animal fairies
are atop the leader board!</i>

149
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:00,623
If it wasn't for those garden fairies,
we'd be in first right now!

150
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:05,044
The animal team deserved to win.
Besides, there are plenty of events left.

151
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:07,379
Focus. Need to focus.

152
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:11,133
All right, do the thing.
Go on, do the thing.

153
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:14,428
Who's the fastest?

154
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:15,888
Rumble is.

155
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,473
Who's the strongest?

156
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,141
Rumble is.

157
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:20,643
Who brings the thunder?

158
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:24,063
Rumble is! I mean, Rumble does!

159
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:25,940
And what's Rumble going for?

160
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:31,153
One for the thumb. One for the thumb!
One for the thumb!

161
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:34,073
Rumble feels better.

162
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:36,325
Go team.

163
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:43,165
Now, Tinker Bell, remember to bend
your knees, and keep your elbows in.

164
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,750
I told you, it's not a skirt.

165
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,252
It is a skirt!

166
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:47,378
It's a kilt!

167
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:49,672
Just wait until tomorrow.
That's when we'll make our move!

168
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:54,426
Look, Chloe, you've done great,
and this has been buckets of fun,

169
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:58,722
but we're in last place.
It's just a matter of time till we...

170
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:00,766
Do you realize what you've done?

171
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,977
You've made it past the first day!

172
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:06,063
It's further than any garden fairy team
in history!

173
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:10,234
You're such an inspiration.

174
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:13,320
And you'd be doing even better
if Rosetta were actually trying.

175
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:15,698
Hey! I was trying!

176
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,741
Really?

177
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:19,034
That was trying?

178
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:22,496
Come on, guys. Give Rosetta a break.

179
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,873
She's doing the best she can,
and we're a team now,

180
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:28,168
so if you're gonna cheer, you have to
cheer for the both of us, okay?

181
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:31,880
And just wait till tomorrow.
We're gonna do even better. Right, Ro?

182
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,382
Dig down deep...

183
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:36,719
And break the streak.

184
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:40,014
- Dig down deep and break the streak.
- Dig down deep and break the streak.

185
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:42,266
Beautiful.

186
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:50,399
<i>We've got a full slate of events today,
including mouse polo, twig spheres...</i>

187
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:51,567
Clank...

188
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,486
<i>...and the tea cup challenge. But first...</i>

189
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,155
Can I do one?

190
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:57,656
Well, be my guest.

191
00:10:57,741 --> 00:11:02,453
<i>But first, dragonfly waterskiing!</i>

192
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:03,579
<i>Clank!</i>

193
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:10,502
You ready for today?

194
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:12,338
Ready as I can be.

195
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:16,091
At least the water's nice and clear.
It's not dirty or slimy.

196
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:18,302
Okay, this is how you do it.

197
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:23,682
Arms straight, bend your knees
and lean back.

198
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:27,936
Wow, this actually looks easy.
I think I could...

199
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,610
Watch your angle!

200
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:38,030
Bend your knees and lean to the right!

201
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,869
Yeah, you've got it!

202
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:50,167
Okay, when we get to the center,
grab the marble and carry it back.

203
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:51,460
Okay, I'll try.

204
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,402
Stop!

205
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,824
Go!

206
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,622
I got one!

207
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:55,941
Nice shot!

208
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,860
- Great shot, Chloe!
- Yeah!

209
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,406
Nice give-and-go, Ro!

210
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,866
That was great!

211
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,534
Good game!

212
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:07,286
Thank you!

213
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:12,166
Why don't you worry
about your own game?

214
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:29,808
Let's speed this along.

215
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:31,393
You got it!

216
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:37,733
More pixie dust!

217
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:45,199
No, no, no, no, no!

218
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:46,700
Get ready to fly!

219
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:53,749
Keep going, keep going, keep going.
We can do it.

220
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:01,131
Get out of my way!

221
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:08,305
- Yes! We did it!
- Rumble wins! Yeah, one for the thumb!

222
00:14:09,224 --> 00:14:10,432
Ro?

223
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,354
Rosetta, you have to go down the slide!

224
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:16,855
I am!

225
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,774
Yes, but it's faster
if you get in the slime.

226
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,443
No, no, no. I'll just meet you down there.

227
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:25,781
But if we don't finish together,
it doesn't count!

228
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:30,369
Chloe, I want to. But I just can't do it.

229
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,960
<i>Bad luck for the garden fairies.</i>

230
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,921
<i>But they're still in the final event,
aren't they, Bobble?</i>

231
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:43,549
<i>Aye, but now they'll start in last place!</i>

232
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:46,635
<i>And no one has ever won it
from last place.</i>

233
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:54,851
You really made Rumble laugh.

234
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:57,646
All that bumbling and stumbling,
just so you wouldn't get dirty?

235
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,357
Get lost, thunder head.

236
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:02,526
I mean of all the garden fairy failures,

237
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:05,862
this has got to be
the most humiliating one of all time!

238
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:06,905
What's your point?

239
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:10,742
My point is garden fairies
should just stick to being pretty.

240
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:12,327
That's what you're good at.

241
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:15,414
But, hey, that's what you've been doing.

242
00:15:19,294 --> 00:15:20,377
Chloe, I just...

243
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:23,505
Don't blame yourself, Rosetta.
You did everything you could.

244
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,756
Well, I...

245
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:29,344
I guess I'll go get cleaned up
for the final event tomorrow.

246
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:33,932
If we're gonna look bad,
we don't wanna look bad, you know?

247
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:03,337
<i>Tinker fairies, you have five minutes
to finish adjusting the carts.</i>

248
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:16,224
Rosetta? Is that you?

249
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:24,399
Chloe, I owe you an apology.
You didn't need a makeover. I did.

250
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,276
Wow!

251
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,195
I finished the modifications we...

252
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,239
Rosetta, you look amazing!

253
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:32,574
Thanks, Tink.

254
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,660
You guys modified our cart?

255
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:36,787
I went back and studied the derby.

256
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:40,040
And I have a plan
to win this whole thing.

257
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,668
Now, are you ready to dig down deep?

258
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:44,961
Oh, yeah. And break the streak.

259
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:49,883
<i>This is it, fairy fans. The final event.</i>

260
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:53,720
<i>Now, the teams will begin
the pixie cart derby in single file,</i>

261
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:55,347
<i>based on the standings.</i>

262
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:58,183
<i>There are only three chances to pass.
The jump...</i>

263
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,309
<i>Not the jump.</i>

264
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:00,602
<i>The pond...</i>

265
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,688
<i>And Mudslide Mountain.</i>

266
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:03,814
<i>Mudslide Mountain.</i>

267
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:07,359
<i>Now, each is a shortcut, but also
progressively more difficult.</i>

268
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:11,571
<i>Play it safe, or take a chance.
What will each team do?</i>

269
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:16,118
<i>Teams, start your engines!</i>

270
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:28,922
- Go, garden fairies!
- Go for broke!

271
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:42,269
<i>And away they go!</i>

272
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:45,814
<i>Which team will etch their name
on the Pixie Hollow trophy?</i>

273
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,738
<i>They're approaching
the first chance to pass.</i>

274
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:54,656
Let's take the jump.

275
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:57,784
We need to pick up more speed!

276
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:00,328
<i>They're going for it!</i>

277
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:09,212
<i>The fast-flying fairies
bite the pixie dust!</i>

278
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:12,007
<i>They're approaching the second
chance to pass, at the pond.</i>

279
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:16,470
We need to hit the lily pad with
enough momentum to push it across!

280
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:22,017
<i>The dust-keepers are out, too!</i>

281
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:25,103
<i>That's not pretty.</i>

282
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:29,858
<i>Now it's down to the garden
and storm fairy teams!</i>

283
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:34,070
I don't think we're gonna be able
to catch them.

284
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:36,198
There's still Mudslide Mountain.

285
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:37,824
Are you sure?

286
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:39,242
That's my plan!

287
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:41,411
But you're afraid of dirt.

288
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:43,497
Yeah. Ironic, isn't it?

289
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,500
Just put these on and pull the lever
when I say.

290
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:48,460
Wow! They even match our outfits!

291
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,378
Hey, it's me.

292
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:54,800
<i>It looks like a lost cause, Clanky.</i>

293
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:58,762
<i>I don't see how the garden fairies
can win now.</i>

294
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:02,307
<i>Wait, Bobble, they're actually
going for Mudslide Mountain!</i>

295
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:05,435
Wait for it, wait for it...

296
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:07,896
Now!

297
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:14,069
It's time to get dirty!

298
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:21,660
- We need more power!
- Got it!

299
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:24,830
- Downshift.
- Downshift.

300
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:26,706
Now, push! Push!

301
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:29,584
Almost there!

302
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:30,669
Almost there!

303
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:32,754
- Almost there!
- We're almost there!

304
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:47,978
- We did it!
- Yeah!

305
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,648
<i>The garden fairies take the lead!</i>

306
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,568
- What are you doing?
- I'm winning.

307
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:58,488
<i>Oh, no! What happened?</i>

308
00:19:58,573 --> 00:20:00,240
<i>That's just terrible!</i>

309
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:02,909
Yes!

310
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,705
- One for the thumb!
- We came so close!

311
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,505
Let's cross that finish line.

312
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,257
Let's do it.

313
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:37,235
One for the thumb! One for the thumb!

314
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:43,825
And the winners of
the Pixie Hollow Games are

315
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,162
the garden fairies!

316
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:49,289
What?

317
00:20:52,043 --> 00:20:54,669
But Rumble crossed the finish line first!

318
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:59,257
Yes, Rumble did,
but teammates must finish together.

319
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:18,026
Yes! We did it!

320
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,444
Yes! Yes! Yes!

321
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:28,620
- Yes!
- Yes! We did it!

322
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,789
- We did it! We did it!
- We did it!

323
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:33,708
- We broke the streak!
- We broke the streak!

324
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:38,964
Rosetta, you've made me so proud
to be a garden fairy.

325
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:42,550
We never could have done it
if it wasn't for you, Chloe.

326
00:21:44,095 --> 00:21:45,929
Is my mud running?

327
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:48,473
Nope!

328
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:49,849
Garden fairies!

329
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:03,196
Well, the Pixie Hollow Games
have made history this year, Clanky.

330
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,323
<i>Indeed it did, Bobble.</i>

331
00:22:05,408 --> 00:22:08,076
<i>And what a journey
for Rosetta and Chloe,</i>

332
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,537
<i>going from worst to first.</i>

333
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:16,376
<i>Now the garden fairies finally have
those elusive championship rings.</i>

334
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:19,421
<i>They certainly made a believer
out of me, let me tell you.</i>

335
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:21,047
<i>Aye, and showed everyone</i>

336
00:22:21,132 --> 00:22:24,259
<i>you can be much more
than just a pretty face.</i>

337
00:22:25,305 --> 00:23:25,463
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
