1
00:00:20,998 --> 00:00:30,786


1
00:00:37,998 --> 00:00:42,786
Appalachian Mountains, USA

2
00:01:48,154 --> 00:01:55,440
The Descent: Part 2
(Dark Descent 2)

3
00:02:04,516 --> 00:02:10,923
While people are still excited by tragedy
last year, here we have a new tragedy Boorom

4
00:02:11,043 --> 00:02:14,870
Extend search of missing girl
the end of the day

5
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:19,728
And hope is lost for Junno, niece
senator, and five of her friends

6
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:24,536
Behind me I see one of the teams
Rescue emerge from caves

7
00:02:24,656 --> 00:02:27,170
- Good luck guys, be careful there ...
- Thanks

8
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:29,374
Any sign of missing woman?

9
00:02:30,626 --> 00:02:35,050
Do you think you will find them alive?

10
00:02:37,444 --> 00:02:40,755
- Enough ...
- You think you go faster this time?

11
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:42,461
Greg!

12
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,122
Get back in four hours.

13
00:02:47,242 --> 00:02:50,101
- Go and sleep ...
- And you boss

14
00:02:50,483 --> 00:02:52,725
Want to share sleeping bag?

15
00:02:52,845 --> 00:02:54,762
What perfume you wearing?

16
00:02:54,882 --> 00:02:59,168
A Yes, he's the smell of dust and sweat,
I think we do not ...

17
00:02:59,754 --> 00:03:02,606
Lynch, what up?

18
00:03:04,266 --> 00:03:07,118
How?

19
00:03:07,238 --> 00:03:09,843
Where?

20
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:16,796
Send tracking dog.
See if you find where you left.

21
00:03:17,611 --> 00:03:19,954
Yeah, right, and ...

22
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:23,394
Stop saying anybody come to the hospital.

23
00:03:44,649 --> 00:03:48,978
- Hey Doc, how is it?
- The rest, I had to sedam

24
00:03:49,098 --> 00:03:52,681
Five girls are missing and you sleep on a
one who knows where?

25
00:03:52,801 --> 00:03:54,532
It was hysterical ...

26
00:03:54,897 --> 00:04:00,703
And besides not know what happened
in the last two days, he forgot what happened.

27
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,085
It hurt?

28
00:04:02,205 --> 00:04:03,896
Only a few cuts and bruises ...

29
00:04:04,471 --> 00:04:06,791
But were his clothes full of blood

30
00:04:07,058 --> 00:04:11,268
- So is her blood?
- No, but he fought

31
00:04:11,493 --> 00:04:15,515
As her nails look, the
scratch all over someone

32
00:04:16,492 --> 00:04:21,327
Test his clothes, take blood type,
compared with the other girls

33
00:04:23,712 --> 00:04:26,241
Okay, let's see what you can do ...

34
00:04:33,084 --> 00:04:35,162
Hi Sarah

35
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:43,724
I am Jenna Reos, sheriff department

36
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,210
He's the sheriff Vaines.

37
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:51,126
How are you?

38
00:04:51,468 --> 00:04:56,149
- Where are they?
-Are you safe at the municipal hospital

39
00:04:58,043 --> 00:05:03,698
I just wanted you and your friends
Two days

40
00:05:03,983 --> 00:05:08,690
All have been on an expedition of caves
and not you come back

41
00:05:09,016 --> 00:05:17,872
I have watched but I sketch caverns gangs nothing
can you tell what you happened?

42
00:05:19,703 --> 00:05:24,552
- Do not know
I do not remember anything.

43
00:05:28,433 --> 00:05:37,520
Sarah, your friends still missing.
And we need you to find them.

44
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,318
- Beth?
- Beth, what happened to Beth?

45
00:05:47,417 --> 00:05:50,225
- What do you remember?

46
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,256
- But Junno?

47
00:05:58,115 --> 00:06:03,697
- Jessy, where is Jessy?
- Your daughter?

48
00:06:08,567 --> 00:06:14,618
Sarah, I want to listen carefully ...

49
00:06:15,962 --> 00:06:19,019
Your daughter is not here, Sarah ...

50
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:21,178
He died ...

51
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:24,275
- A year ago, in Scotland.
- No!

52
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:32,602
-You know how hard it is, but should try ...
- No! No!

53
00:06:33,494 --> 00:06:36,320
Here we go ...

54
00:06:47,985 --> 00:06:56,083
You bring the dogs, well, out there ....
Was covered with blood.

55
00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:01,820
You got it? Smell this ... hai ...

56
00:07:16,438 --> 00:07:20,640
It's the end all here ...

57
00:07:21,506 --> 00:07:25,606
- What is that?
- Entering the mine ...

58
00:07:30,649 --> 00:07:37,474
Come here!
Run and find the boy!

59
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:52,204
One day I come to take my
a bit of nonsense ...

60
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:57,934
What you got kid? What have you found?

61
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,601
Damn!

62
00:08:30,508 --> 00:08:34,608
- Sheriff?
- Dan, you for you, I found one of the girls

63
00:08:34,965 --> 00:08:37,945
The dog gave the result of the old mine

64
00:08:37,995 --> 00:08:39,647
- Is outside the jurisdiction
- I

65
00:08:41,171 --> 00:08:43,388
So we are in the wrong place ...

66
00:08:43,508 --> 00:08:48,994
I do not want all the circus, I just want some volunteers
to continue from where the finished dog

67
00:08:49,255 --> 00:08:51,619
Well, give us a time ...

68
00:08:54,455 --> 00:08:57,079
Cath, Greg? Awakening ...

69
00:08:57,199 --> 00:09:03,181
Blood on clothes is a positive.
Juno is also a positive.

70
00:09:03,301 --> 00:09:06,651
So what? I have positive.
Half the state is A positive.

71
00:09:06,771 --> 00:09:09,198
- Can you go?
- Sure.

72
00:09:09,318 --> 00:09:16,870
- Wait, you serious?
- Wear it and climb it in the car

73
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:44,467
My grandfather worked down there

74
00:10:44,587 --> 00:10:49,370
Once he and two friends were given an area
of large caverns

75
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:58,244
The head thought to be a gold and he sent
my grandfather there to see

76
00:10:58,364 --> 00:11:01,291
And did not come back ...

77
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:05,084
Perhaps they entered directly into hell ...

78
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:14,162
You mean it's a whole system of caves there?

79
00:11:14,282 --> 00:11:16,213
Goods!

80
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:21,996
Here's a map of the mine ...
but not one to know where to begin ...

81
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,037
We face ...

82
00:11:26,157 --> 00:11:28,960
Come on, is the only one who was there.

83
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:35,302
You just have to say left-right, quickly find
There are many caves, and we have time.

84
00:11:35,422 --> 00:11:38,783
We can use cables to lift ...

85
00:11:38,903 --> 00:11:43,447
-If you want to get out there, why not do it properly?
- This shit still work?

86
00:11:44,628 --> 00:11:50,473
Boy I tell you something, this shit gonna
work long and hard after that your mp3's.

87
00:11:50,593 --> 00:11:52,649
Whatever ...

88
00:11:53,581 --> 00:11:57,871
Ok, start ...

89
00:11:58,471 --> 00:12:01,626
Sorry, but Mommy has to help
people tonight

90
00:12:02,076 --> 00:12:05,673
When her grandmother tells you to sleep,
sleep, right?

91
00:12:06,699 --> 00:12:08,201
My dear ...

92
00:12:09,486 --> 00:12:10,955
I love ...

93
00:12:11,872 --> 00:12:15,044
Well honey, see you tomorrow, right?

94
00:12:16,888 --> 00:12:21,519
Rose, get your equipment,
and they give him one, descend down ...

95
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:35,774
Sarah, I know it's difficult but if you do that
you will be reminded.

96
00:12:36,234 --> 00:12:41,691
Your friends may be alive
We need help to find them.

97
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:54,758
Hey Sarah, that you should include ...

98
00:12:56,393 --> 00:13:00,858
Get rid of heavy metal ala ... A gunshot
there is like to put dynamite.

99
00:13:01,342 --> 00:13:06,541
- They put me in the car ...
- My gun stays with me.

100
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:14,012
This is a case of missing persons,
What do you think you will find there?

101
00:13:37,172 --> 00:13:39,477
Here we go ...

102
00:13:48,917 --> 00:13:50,429
Come ...

103
00:13:55,567 --> 00:13:59,478
- You are ready to walk?
- Yes, let's go.

104
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:56,309
Jesus ...

105
00:16:05,905 --> 00:16:09,104
Wait a little ...

106
00:16:14,658 --> 00:16:16,862
Here, drink this.

107
00:16:18,581 --> 00:16:21,953
It's OK ...
Do not worry ...

108
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,777
Come on Dan, go to those caves!

109
00:16:27,503 --> 00:16:29,322
Listen ...

110
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:33,611
Here I give orders.
Got it?

111
00:16:34,671 --> 00:16:36,432
Loud and clear ...

112
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:39,785
Let's go.

113
00:17:21,186 --> 00:17:25,726
We need the light down there.

114
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:29,558
Since I learned?

115
00:17:30,609 --> 00:17:33,380
Light 's life.

116
00:17:38,615 --> 00:17:41,569
Well, gotta get a lower level.

117
00:17:41,689 --> 00:17:43,968
Greg?

118
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:56,817
You kiddin 'me?

119
00:18:21,285 --> 00:18:22,779
Is it okay?

120
00:18:22,899 --> 00:18:27,060
You know what is right?
Most mines have metal poles

121
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:30,713
- But I preferred the old wood.
- Why?

122
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:34,603
- The metal does not give you any
warning when no longer resist.

123
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:44,755
After you ...

124
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,087
Okay, you should give the caverns
here somewhere.

125
00:18:56,137 --> 00:18:59,634
- Creg? See what it's in front.
- Okay.

126
00:19:14,711 --> 00:19:17,781
I think it is.

127
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:22,446
What the hell is that?

128
00:19:23,433 --> 00:19:25,085
A warning of mines.

129
00:19:25,636 --> 00:19:27,897
<i> *** DANGER ***
*** Stay ***</ i></i>

130
00:19:28,017 --> 00:19:30,418
Always good sign?

131
00:19:47,891 --> 00:19:50,956
Look here ...

132
00:19:51,076 --> 00:19:55,275
It's too hard ...

133
00:20:13,165 --> 00:20:16,523
Greg, camera ...

134
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:24,542
Hey, hey ... not touch anything.
This place has thousands of years old.

135
00:20:25,308 --> 00:20:28,858
- Well, you're hot ...
- Get out of here.

136
00:20:29,201 --> 00:20:34,107
Sarah?
Recognize you?

137
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,812
What?

138
00:21:33,368 --> 00:21:35,617
It's OK, just freaked.

139
00:21:45,324 --> 00:21:47,508
Calcium deposits.

140
00:21:49,496 --> 00:21:53,506
- Continue.
- It's okay, go ...

141
00:22:06,981 --> 00:22:08,416
Come ...

142
00:22:17,081 --> 00:22:22,084
- Come on Sheriff, you do it.
- I'm so old, yet!

143
00:22:27,153 --> 00:22:29,370
Way?

144
00:22:31,033 --> 00:22:34,015
Recognize this place?

145
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:39,139
Cath? Get and listen a little ...

146
00:23:28,397 --> 00:23:32,668
- Something?
- Do not know. I think I hear something.

147
00:24:10,239 --> 00:24:13,254
- Jesus ...
- Damn ...

148
00:24:13,374 --> 00:24:16,205
Sarah, look at me.

149
00:24:17,509 --> 00:24:22,741
- Moving ...
- No, not body temperature is impossible.

150
00:24:36,877 --> 00:24:39,583
Sarah ... hai ...

151
00:24:45,173 --> 00:24:47,699
It was slaughtered!

152
00:24:48,188 --> 00:24:52,315
Six girls came into this cave,
one down,

153
00:24:52,435 --> 00:24:57,886
Covered by the blood of others.
Tell me what the hell happened here?

154
00:24:58,006 --> 00:25:00,671
- Wait, do you think it took about that?
- Hell, you brought her here.

155
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:05,148
- Leave me alone!
- Greg, let him!

156
00:25:05,268 --> 00:25:09,376
If she was the victim here,
now say is suspect?

157
00:25:09,496 --> 00:25:14,897
I think he knows something. Since there are girls
missing, let us focus.

158
00:25:17,285 --> 00:25:19,623
Dan, I think he came here.

159
00:25:19,743 --> 00:25:25,094
- Well, Greg Go ahead!
- This is a bullshit!

160
00:25:25,214 --> 00:25:31,610
- Take care of her.
- Let a be ...

161
00:25:51,512 --> 00:25:57,034
Sarah, what?

162
00:25:58,476 --> 00:26:03,749
I guess something here ...
We were attacked.

163
00:26:03,869 --> 00:26:08,972
- Who?
- There is nothing here that can do that to a man.

164
00:26:09,092 --> 00:26:15,538
Sarah, you remember?
Sarah?

165
00:26:16,383 --> 00:26:19,069
I should stay here ...

166
00:26:19,189 --> 00:26:25,038
Try to think rationally, you're scared,
Your mind plays tricks.

167
00:26:25,158 --> 00:26:32,549
- I passed, some tight spaces and reach
- I understand.

168
00:26:32,669 --> 00:26:39,662
Sheriff prepare the team.
Greg come. Wait for us there.

169
00:26:39,782 --> 00:26:47,168
Rios, go first.
I sit on her, not me escape.

170
00:27:41,918 --> 00:27:46,783
Come closer you get.

171
00:27:46,903 --> 00:27:52,797
Wait, you have to breathe, right?

172
00:27:55,433 --> 00:28:00,771
Come, keep going!

173
00:28:02,663 --> 00:28:05,366
Move, we slow down!

174
00:28:12,934 --> 00:28:15,840
Why did you stop?
Move!

175
00:28:17,596 --> 00:28:19,421
Are you okay?
Hey!

176
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:32,936
Damn, Rios ...

177
00:28:33,882 --> 00:28:40,301
Which way to get it? Where?
Damn!

178
00:28:56,621 --> 00:29:00,608
That is a psychopath, Dan ...

179
00:29:00,728 --> 00:29:02,230
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

180
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:03,919
Look at me,
how are you?

181
00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:05,811
- You better kiss me?
- You okay?

182
00:29:05,931 --> 00:29:09,528
- Where is Vaines?
- He went after Sarah.

183
00:29:09,648 --> 00:29:15,136
Hell, no no radio station,
can be lost easily.

184
00:29:15,256 --> 00:29:20,610
Listen, I have to catch up
before reaching too far.

185
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:25,678
This time stick together. Understood?
Okay, let's go.

186
00:30:04,144 --> 00:30:10,817
Okay, falling rocks. This means that
the roof is unstable, we must be careful.

187
00:30:10,937 --> 00:30:17,912
Rios, you stay with me.
Okay? Let's go.

188
00:32:59,373 --> 00:33:06,300
- Cath hear me?
- Take it easy, we must reach.

189
00:33:07,567 --> 00:33:15,675
Cath, you hear me?
Cath, talk to me.

190
00:33:21,588 --> 00:33:27,247
- Dan are you there?
- I'm here. Are you hurt?

191
00:33:28,092 --> 00:33:32,146
They are stuck between rocks, we
need someone to take the stones.

192
00:33:32,266 --> 00:33:38,988
Well, do not panic. Listen,
I take you out of there was a stone out of here

193
00:33:39,108 --> 00:33:48,701
- Listen, stay calm, get you out.
- Okay.

194
00:33:53,493 --> 00:33:57,125
Hell, let ... Come, Jesus!

195
00:33:57,245 --> 00:33:59,406
Dan?

196
00:34:00,842 --> 00:34:04,896
Go!

197
00:34:05,016 --> 00:34:09,288
- Damn!
- Dan?

198
00:34:11,062 --> 00:34:18,580
- Do not let you hear it
- It's a tunnel full of rock, hell ...

199
00:34:37,838 --> 00:34:42,484
- Cath?
- Yes?

200
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:50,254
- This is cool ...
- You can forge it, or blow it?

201
00:34:50,374 --> 00:34:54,900
We can not, it's too risky.
You can not sneak me?

202
00:34:55,020 --> 00:35:02,418
Can Dan, I will crush,
I need you here.

203
00:35:04,952 --> 00:35:10,146
- I find another way to you.
- Okay.

204
00:35:10,831 --> 00:35:13,862
I come to you.

205
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:17,550
I scared Dan.

206
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:21,788
Good, I fear you-n life. E. ..

207
00:35:25,244 --> 00:35:30,720
- I promise, I come to pick you up.
- I know.

208
00:35:32,073 --> 00:35:33,719
Maybe I should stay with her.

209
00:35:34,846 --> 00:35:39,068
We can help here ...

210
00:35:42,914 --> 00:35:46,745
- Hang in there mate.
- Do not worry.

211
00:35:47,396 --> 00:35:51,325
Cath, you're dry?

212
00:35:52,677 --> 00:35:54,845
Yes.

213
00:35:54,965 --> 00:36:01,892
- Stay warm, drink water, right?
- Okay.

214
00:36:02,935 --> 00:36:09,895
We must go now, probably
signal will be lost, stay positive.

215
00:36:12,258 --> 00:36:14,605
Well.

216
00:36:16,577 --> 00:36:21,659
- Us away, stay on channel 1.
- Okay.

217
00:36:22,685 --> 00:36:25,841
We run on channel 1.

218
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:05,061
Damn!

219
00:38:22,752 --> 00:38:24,129
What the hell?

220
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:49,394
- There are animal bones?
- Jesus!

221
00:39:06,269 --> 00:39:08,013
Dan, Dan!

222
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:31,757
In the morning before.
Come on. Ladies shine.

223
00:39:36,149 --> 00:39:38,686
We are ready for the big event

224
00:39:39,295 --> 00:39:40,772
Develops ...

225
00:39:47,258 --> 00:39:50,696
What are you doing?

226
00:39:57,489 --> 00:40:00,794
Go to cave.

227
00:40:00,914 --> 00:40:02,838
How do you think Sarah feels? You think it's ready?

228
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:09,692
Close room.

229
00:40:12,646 --> 00:40:17,292
Sarah?
Hang two minutes.

230
00:40:17,412 --> 00:40:18,595
Where am I?

231
00:40:19,757 --> 00:40:25,625
Take a break, I made some pictures in May.
Cave that's more interesting than I thought.

232
00:40:26,134 --> 00:40:30,779
That was in the book.

233
00:40:32,736 --> 00:40:34,916
How far we go?

234
00:40:46,183 --> 00:40:47,588
Did you hear that?

235
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:53,314
That's it?

236
00:40:55,844 --> 00:41:00,591
Dead animals, hundreds.

237
00:41:00,711 --> 00:41:02,587
I'm here.

238
00:41:04,217 --> 00:41:08,313
- Let's go.
- Where to go, we do not know where.

239
00:41:11,389 --> 00:41:16,972
Damn, hello? Is anyone there?

240
00:41:28,474 --> 00:41:31,428
Greg!

241
00:41:37,744 --> 00:41:39,700
Greg, where are you?

242
00:42:20,769 --> 00:42:22,990
Dan?

243
00:42:24,763 --> 00:42:28,145
Dan, here!
Where are you?

244
00:42:31,058 --> 00:42:34,298
Dan, where are you?

245
00:42:58,729 --> 00:43:04,250
Rios!

246
00:43:08,363 --> 00:43:13,416
Rios, where are you? Tell me where you are.
I do not hear!

247
00:43:15,555 --> 00:43:16,431
Sarah ...

248
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:29,736
- What the hell was that?
- Do not worry, it's just your mind playing tricks on you.

249
00:45:31,142 --> 00:45:36,072
Dan? Greg?

250
00:45:38,537 --> 00:45:41,369
Dan you are?

251
00:45:42,734 --> 00:45:46,504
Dan I hear?

252
00:47:36,342 --> 00:47:40,498
Sarah?

253
00:47:42,739 --> 00:47:49,361
- Sorry I do not believe.
- I am blind, follow the sound, loud talking.

254
00:49:00,599 --> 00:49:05,041
- Where are the others?
- We went out.

255
00:49:06,041 --> 00:49:09,545
- Who the hell are these?
- I know, but I got the flashlight.

256
00:49:14,195 --> 00:49:16,390
Take that, right?

257
00:49:22,959 --> 00:49:26,014
Run. Run!

258
00:50:07,913 --> 00:50:09,799
Damn!

259
00:50:14,758 --> 00:50:17,228
Jesus Christ, Dan!

260
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:29,485
Bullshit!

261
00:51:13,450 --> 00:51:16,445
<i> you hear me? </ i></i>

262
00:51:17,831 --> 00:51:20,928
You hear me?
Is anyone there?

263
00:51:21,294 --> 00:51:24,778
Up! Up!

264
00:51:30,116 --> 00:51:31,767
Dan is dead.

265
00:51:31,887 --> 00:51:36,392
<i>- Turn it down!
 - anybody hear me? </ i></i>

266
00:51:42,590 --> 00:51:47,521
<i> anybody hear me?
Will you </ i></i>

267
00:51:55,019 --> 00:51:58,951
Dan responds,
are Cath, answer.

268
00:51:59,684 --> 00:52:03,433
- Dan is dead.
- Dan, answer. Dan!

269
00:52:03,922 --> 00:52:07,671
- Vaines had his station.
- I know it was not clear.

270
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:11,671
Yes, Dan responds. Dan?

271
00:52:13,118 --> 00:52:17,847
- I left there ... listen ...
These evils attacked us

272
00:52:17,967 --> 00:52:20,554
- No, he promised to return.
- Stay calm.

273
00:52:20,674 --> 00:52:25,566
I heard screaming Cath ...

274
00:52:28,032 --> 00:52:32,086
Went Cath, right?

275
00:52:39,816 --> 00:52:44,950
I leave you alone ...

276
00:52:45,070 --> 00:52:49,514
I just try and kill you with my hand.

277
00:52:50,472 --> 00:52:54,261
We must go,
keep silent, come on.

278
00:53:07,639 --> 00:53:10,878
Jesus!

279
00:53:13,344 --> 00:53:16,807
Damn!

280
00:53:18,009 --> 00:53:21,351
- You need to jump.
- It's too far.

281
00:53:23,658 --> 00:53:27,366
Agata you to move beyond it.

282
00:53:30,117 --> 00:53:31,746
Go.

283
00:53:31,866 --> 00:53:34,415
- Damn!
- We have a choice.

284
00:53:35,414 --> 00:53:38,164
Go!

285
00:53:42,259 --> 00:53:45,540
Go ahead!

286
00:55:13,731 --> 00:55:18,213
Greg!

287
00:55:21,962 --> 00:55:25,446
Greg!

288
00:56:05,614 --> 00:56:12,195
- Last time I went by water.
- I can not go in there.

289
00:56:13,153 --> 00:56:17,350
Water flows,
been a switch.

290
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:23,483
Wait, please!

291
00:57:58,564 --> 00:58:00,070
Sarah!

292
00:58:03,134 --> 00:58:09,370
God!
Sarah!

293
00:58:31,681 --> 00:58:36,836
- It stops here? Do not go farther?
- Yes.

294
00:58:37,961 --> 00:58:43,192
Damn!

295
00:59:30,376 --> 00:59:37,158
Hi my little girl.
It's me, Mommy.

296
00:59:39,427 --> 00:59:47,398
I just wanted to say I love you.

297
00:59:49,823 --> 00:59:55,414
I want to be good and proper.

298
00:59:56,106 --> 01:00:02,915
And soul, I want to be a good person.

299
01:00:03,884 --> 01:00:07,399
My love, you are so special ...

300
01:00:10,829 --> 01:00:14,678
Take care of yourself.

301
01:00:21,312 --> 01:00:23,146
My daughter is dead.

302
01:00:25,222 --> 01:00:27,678
I know ...

303
01:00:31,814 --> 01:00:39,149
Everything you say, say it in front.
I died again. Let's go.

304
01:02:04,956 --> 01:02:09,903
Junno.

305
01:02:10,976 --> 01:02:19,314
I am here to help you, take you out.
You hear me? I'm with Sarah.

306
01:04:26,980 --> 01:04:28,640
Move!

307
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:31,359
Sarah!

308
01:06:56,152 --> 01:07:01,134
Oh.
What the fuck is that?

309
01:07:01,917 --> 01:07:05,100
I do not know ...

310
01:07:30,391 --> 01:07:34,854
Now I would have liked to be in that water.

311
01:09:05,282 --> 01:09:08,569
What are these?

312
01:09:09,365 --> 01:09:12,479
Death.

313
01:09:27,757 --> 01:09:34,019
- Friends. They are all dead?
- Yes.

314
01:09:37,963 --> 01:09:45,263
- How did you find this hellhole?
- Junno brought us here, wanted to discover.

315
01:09:45,713 --> 01:09:50,453
- He said he wanted to give my name.
- Why?

316
01:09:50,573 --> 01:09:52,875
The feeling of guilt.

317
01:09:54,016 --> 01:09:56,853
What was between you two?

318
01:09:57,481 --> 01:09:59,601
My husband.

319
01:09:59,721 --> 01:10:04,756
- He had an affair with my husband.
- What happened to her?

320
01:10:10,265 --> 01:10:13,143
Junno and I just left ...

321
01:10:13,263 --> 01:10:15,740
Those things were coming after us.

322
01:10:15,860 --> 01:10:20,757
So I hurt her so I can escape.

323
01:10:20,877 --> 01:10:25,571
He left it on my friend Beth
to die, alone.

324
01:10:27,422 --> 01:10:33,407
When I found it on Beth had
to stop the suffering, to kill.

325
01:10:38,475 --> 01:10:42,218
Save Flashlight ...

326
01:11:33,527 --> 01:11:36,023
Junno, no!
Junno wait!

327
01:11:36,379 --> 01:11:40,760
I came to you out of here.
Junno, Sarah brought us here.

328
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:46,082
She brought us here.
Junno, Sarah's friend.

329
01:11:57,670 --> 01:12:01,821
- So you are rescue team?
- We are what's left.

330
01:12:02,509 --> 01:12:04,699
Come on, you have to get out of here.

331
01:12:04,819 --> 01:12:06,843
Listen up.

332
01:12:06,963 --> 01:12:13,006
Hunting stuff out, I think I know
where you have an exit to the surface.

333
01:12:13,126 --> 01:12:15,986
- Then go.
- Wait, what?

334
01:12:16,106 --> 01:12:18,863
We go where the food?

335
01:12:18,983 --> 01:12:21,283
- Are you kidding?
- You want to live?

336
01:12:21,403 --> 01:12:25,281
Silence is what's best weapon.
Follow me.

337
01:12:25,401 --> 01:12:28,973
- We follow the water.
- There is no water, Junno knows out.

338
01:12:29,093 --> 01:12:31,257
So how are you here?

339
01:12:31,377 --> 01:12:34,220
Because I had the light,
I had the equipment.

340
01:12:34,340 --> 01:12:38,425
And because I stuck my partner
knife in the leg and fled.

341
01:12:38,545 --> 01:12:42,681
Over with. If we want to
get out of here alive a follow on Junno.

342
01:12:42,889 --> 01:12:45,090
No nohow!

343
01:12:45,330 --> 01:12:48,762
Bullshit! I've brought you here,
I take you out!

344
01:12:49,795 --> 01:12:52,332
- What the hell?
- In vain you shake!

345
01:12:52,599 --> 01:12:55,445
- Sheriff?
- Shut up Rose!

346
01:12:57,276 --> 01:12:59,284
Let's go!

347
01:13:19,826 --> 01:13:21,772
Go!

348
01:13:42,747 --> 01:13:47,558
We need to move by one ...

349
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:06,587
Disperses weight ...

350
01:14:17,773 --> 01:14:21,723
Keep your stability.

351
01:14:26,963 --> 01:14:29,990
Easy ...

352
01:14:31,288 --> 01:14:36,531
- We should do this at a time.
- You run it, but not one to run from me.

353
01:14:36,651 --> 01:14:41,018
So go ahead!

354
01:15:04,047 --> 01:15:05,561
Bullshit!

355
01:15:22,427 --> 01:15:27,563
- Help me!
- Give me your bag.

356
01:15:29,515 --> 01:15:32,380
Junno help me, please.

357
01:15:40,867 --> 01:15:43,072
Damn!

358
01:15:43,192 --> 01:15:45,408
Pull me up!

359
01:15:48,868 --> 01:15:52,003
Bring hatchet.

360
01:15:54,166 --> 01:15:57,161
- Cut it.
- What? What's yours?

361
01:15:57,281 --> 01:16:00,351
- Cut it or both die.
- Oh, cut it!

362
01:16:06,694 --> 01:16:07,987
Wait!

363
01:16:24,911 --> 01:16:26,171
Hurry!

364
01:16:55,776 --> 01:16:59,566
Damn!
Ok, gotta go.

365
01:17:08,683 --> 01:17:11,587
We gotta go.

366
01:17:13,675 --> 01:17:16,731
Rios?

367
01:17:18,208 --> 01:17:21,162
Sarah?

368
01:17:21,774 --> 01:17:25,670
Come on.

369
01:19:38,006 --> 01:19:40,857
Help!

370
01:20:35,723 --> 01:20:38,468
Let's go!

371
01:20:57,473 --> 01:21:01,591
No!

372
01:21:47,096 --> 01:21:54,804
- Sorry.
- Nothing.

373
01:22:08,888 --> 01:22:16,642
Sarah?
We can not stay here.

374
01:22:20,601 --> 01:22:26,705
Sarah should get out of here now.

375
01:22:32,479 --> 01:22:36,274
<i> Bones every day </ i></i>

376
01:22:36,394 --> 01:22:42,145
Sarah, please.

377
01:24:56,651 --> 01:24:58,917
Come ...
