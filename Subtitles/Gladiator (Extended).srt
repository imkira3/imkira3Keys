1
00:03:18,229 --> 00:03:19,308
Sir.

2
00:03:19,397 --> 00:03:20,891
General.

3
00:03:31,534 --> 00:03:32,649
Sir.

4
00:03:47,633 --> 00:03:49,258
Lean and hungry.

5
00:03:52,513 --> 00:03:55,218
- Still nothing?
- Not a sign.

6
00:03:55,308 --> 00:03:58,843
How long has he been gone?
Nearly two hours.

7
00:04:01,189 --> 00:04:02,980
Will they fight, sir?

8
00:04:03,066 --> 00:04:04,524
We shall know soon enough.

9
00:04:04,609 --> 00:04:07,278
Soldier, I ordered you
to move those catapults forward.

10
00:04:07,361 --> 00:04:09,687
- They're out of range.
- Range is good.

11
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,656
- The danger to the cavalry...
- Is acceptable. Agreed?

12
00:04:24,337 --> 00:04:25,582
They say no.

13
00:04:51,364 --> 00:04:53,902
People should know
when they're conquered.

14
00:05:04,377 --> 00:05:06,168
Would you, Quintus?

15
00:05:07,088 --> 00:05:08,368
Would I?

16
00:05:25,106 --> 00:05:27,811
Strength and honor.

17
00:05:33,448 --> 00:05:36,567
At my signal, unleash hell.

18
00:05:59,307 --> 00:06:00,849
Load the catapults.

19
00:06:01,726 --> 00:06:03,683
Infantry form up for advance.

20
00:06:05,146 --> 00:06:07,554
Archers ready.
Archers!

21
00:06:07,648 --> 00:06:09,107
Nock!

22
00:06:32,924 --> 00:06:34,299
<i>Fratres!</i>

23
00:06:34,384 --> 00:06:36,341
Maximus!

24
00:06:37,428 --> 00:06:41,508
Three weeks from now,
I will be harvesting my crops.

25
00:06:41,849 --> 00:06:46,310
Imagine where you will be, and it will be so.

26
00:06:47,021 --> 00:06:50,355
Hold the line! Stay with me!

27
00:06:50,441 --> 00:06:53,111
If you find yourself alone...

28
00:06:53,194 --> 00:06:56,195
riding in green fields
with the sun on your face...

29
00:06:57,448 --> 00:06:59,571
do not be troubled.

30
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:04,075
For you are in Elysium,
and you're already dead!

31
00:07:06,207 --> 00:07:07,867
Brothers...

32
00:07:09,252 --> 00:07:11,079
what we do in life...

33
00:07:12,171 --> 00:07:14,128
echoes in eternity.

34
00:07:22,306 --> 00:07:23,587
Pull!

35
00:07:39,198 --> 00:07:41,238
Catapults ready, sir!

36
00:07:51,961 --> 00:07:54,286
Archers, ignite!

37
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:57,002
Ignite!

38
00:08:03,014 --> 00:08:05,683
Archers, draw!

39
00:08:09,187 --> 00:08:10,515
Loose!

40
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:41,917
All right, men, ready!

41
00:08:47,517 --> 00:08:49,426
Hold the line!

42
00:08:57,693 --> 00:08:59,816
Loose!

43
00:08:59,904 --> 00:09:01,363
Reload!

44
00:09:06,369 --> 00:09:08,361
Hold the line!

45
00:09:08,454 --> 00:09:10,826
- Draw!
- Loose!

46
00:09:13,376 --> 00:09:15,167
Stay with me!

47
00:09:20,508 --> 00:09:22,714
Stay with me!

48
00:09:50,705 --> 00:09:53,575
<i>Roma victor!</i>

49
00:12:26,611 --> 00:12:28,603
<i>Roma victor!</i>

50
00:13:10,905 --> 00:13:13,443
Do you think he's really dying?

51
00:13:14,325 --> 00:13:16,318
He's been dying for 10 years.

52
00:13:17,745 --> 00:13:20,746
If he weren't really dying,
he wouldn't have sent for us.

53
00:13:20,832 --> 00:13:22,741
Maybe he just misses us.

54
00:13:22,834 --> 00:13:25,503
And the senators?
He wouldn't have summoned them if...

55
00:13:25,586 --> 00:13:26,749
Peace, Commodus.

56
00:13:26,838 --> 00:13:30,882
After two weeks on the road,
your incessant scheming is hurting my head.

57
00:13:38,307 --> 00:13:41,723
He's made his decision.
He's going to announce it.

58
00:13:45,356 --> 00:13:47,265
He will name me.

59
00:13:50,153 --> 00:13:53,771
The first thing I shall do when...

60
00:13:56,576 --> 00:13:59,861
Is honor him with games
worthy of His Majesty.

61
00:13:59,954 --> 00:14:04,782
For now, the first thing I shall do
is have a hot bath.

62
00:14:06,544 --> 00:14:08,287
Your Highness?

63
00:14:12,091 --> 00:14:14,582
We seem to be almost there, sire.

64
00:14:20,391 --> 00:14:22,467
Sire.
Where's the Emperor?

65
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,727
He's at the front, sire.
They've been gone for 19 days.

66
00:14:26,272 --> 00:14:28,514
<i>The wounded are still coming in.</i>

67
00:14:28,608 --> 00:14:30,232
My horse.

68
00:14:30,318 --> 00:14:31,978
My lord.

69
00:14:35,531 --> 00:14:36,611
Kiss?

70
00:15:12,485 --> 00:15:15,984
You have proved your valor yet again,
Maximus.

71
00:15:18,241 --> 00:15:20,945
Let us hope, for the last time.

72
00:15:21,327 --> 00:15:23,652
There's no one left to fight, sire.

73
00:15:23,746 --> 00:15:26,237
There is always someone left to fight.

74
00:15:26,457 --> 00:15:29,375
How can I reward Rome's greatest general?

75
00:15:34,841 --> 00:15:36,335
Let me go home.

76
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:40,168
Home.

77
00:15:58,948 --> 00:16:00,526
They honor you, Caesar.

78
00:16:00,616 --> 00:16:03,404
It's for you, Maximus. They honor you.

79
00:16:26,392 --> 00:16:29,097
Have I missed it? Have I missed the battle?

80
00:16:30,772 --> 00:16:32,563
You have missed the war.

81
00:16:32,648 --> 00:16:34,855
Father, congratulations.

82
00:16:35,318 --> 00:16:37,725
I shall sacrifice 100 bulls
to honor your triumph.

83
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,480
Save the bulls.

84
00:16:39,572 --> 00:16:42,028
Honor Maximus. He won the battle.

85
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:44,775
General.
Highness.

86
00:16:45,787 --> 00:16:49,405
Rome salutes you,
and I embrace you as a brother.

87
00:16:49,499 --> 00:16:51,290
It has been too long, my old friend.

88
00:16:51,376 --> 00:16:52,751
Highness.

89
00:16:52,877 --> 00:16:55,450
Here, Father. Take my arm.

90
00:16:57,048 --> 00:17:00,251
I think it is time for me to leave.

91
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,733
So much for the glory of Rome.

92
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:49,575
Magnificent battle.

93
00:19:13,518 --> 00:19:15,226
General. Still alive?

94
00:19:15,311 --> 00:19:16,592
Still alive.

95
00:19:16,687 --> 00:19:18,312
The gods must have a sense of humor.

96
00:19:18,398 --> 00:19:21,067
The gods must love you.
Valerius.

97
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:23,937
Back to barracks, General? Or to Rome?

98
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:27,190
Home. My wife, my son, the harvest.

99
00:19:27,824 --> 00:19:31,157
Maximus the farmer.
I still have difficulty imagining that.

100
00:19:31,244 --> 00:19:34,826
You know, dirt cleans off
a lot easier than blood, Quintus.

101
00:19:34,914 --> 00:19:37,037
- Here he is.
- Highness.

102
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:39,283
Senator Gaius, Senator Falco.

103
00:19:39,377 --> 00:19:42,331
Beware of Gaius.
He'll pour a honeyed potion in your ear...

104
00:19:42,422 --> 00:19:45,921
and you'll wake up one day and all
you'll say is, Republic."

105
00:19:46,008 --> 00:19:48,678
Well, why not?
Rome was founded as a republic.

106
00:19:48,761 --> 00:19:51,383
Yes, and in a republic
the senate has the power.

107
00:19:51,472 --> 00:19:53,963
But Senator Gaius
isn't influenced by that, of course.

108
00:19:54,058 --> 00:19:56,680
Where do you stand, General?
Emperor or Senate?

109
00:19:56,769 --> 00:20:01,597
A soldier has the advantage of being able
to look his enemy in the eye, Senator.

110
00:20:02,024 --> 00:20:05,939
Well, with an army behind you,
you could be extremely political.

111
00:20:06,028 --> 00:20:09,113
I warned you. Now I shall save you.
Senators.

112
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,411
Maximus.

113
00:20:21,544 --> 00:20:24,000
I'm going to need good men like you.

114
00:20:26,132 --> 00:20:28,670
How may I be of service, Highness?

115
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,381
You're a man who knows what it is
to command.

116
00:20:31,888 --> 00:20:35,173
You give your orders, the orders are obeyed,
and the battle is won.

117
00:20:35,266 --> 00:20:40,058
But these senators scheme, squabble
and flatter and deceive.

118
00:20:40,605 --> 00:20:43,559
We must save Rome
from the politicians, my friend.

119
00:20:43,649 --> 00:20:46,734
Can I count on you when the time comes?

120
00:20:52,575 --> 00:20:55,611
Highness, when your father releases me,
I intend to return home.

121
00:20:55,703 --> 00:20:58,906
Home? Well, no one's earned it more.

122
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:04,200
Don't get too comfortable.
I may call on you before long.

123
00:21:06,255 --> 00:21:08,829
Lucilla's here. Did you know?

124
00:21:09,384 --> 00:21:11,293
She's not forgotten you.

125
00:21:12,595 --> 00:21:14,718
And now, you're the great man.

126
00:21:27,235 --> 00:21:29,726
If only you had been born a man...

127
00:21:30,822 --> 00:21:33,063
what a Caesar you would have made.

128
00:21:34,742 --> 00:21:36,201
Father.

129
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:44,034
You would have been strong.

130
00:21:44,127 --> 00:21:47,330
I wonder, would you have been just?

131
00:21:48,297 --> 00:21:50,919
I would have been
what you taught me to be.

132
00:21:52,885 --> 00:21:54,428
How was your journey?

133
00:21:54,512 --> 00:21:58,676
Long. Uncomfortable. Why have I come?

134
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:01,471
I need your help. With your brother.

135
00:22:02,103 --> 00:22:03,597
Of course.

136
00:22:03,688 --> 00:22:05,846
He loves you. He always has.

137
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:08,020
And...

138
00:22:09,944 --> 00:22:13,111
he will need you now, more than ever.

139
00:22:18,161 --> 00:22:20,034
Enough of politics.

140
00:22:20,371 --> 00:22:23,372
Let us pretend
that you are a loving daughter...

141
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:26,163
and I am a good father.

142
00:22:31,758 --> 00:22:34,509
This is a pleasant fiction, isn't it?

143
00:22:47,398 --> 00:22:49,023
Good morning.

144
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,535
I need three more horses.

145
00:23:14,842 --> 00:23:16,835
<i>Two! Three!</i>

146
00:23:17,512 --> 00:23:18,757
Four!

147
00:23:18,846 --> 00:23:21,516
One! Two!

148
00:23:37,323 --> 00:23:39,482
You sent for me, Caesar?

149
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,915
- Caesar?
- Tell me again, Maximus.

150
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,708
Why are we here?

151
00:23:51,003 --> 00:23:53,541
For the glory of the empire, sire.

152
00:23:54,006 --> 00:23:55,086
Yes.

153
00:23:57,093 --> 00:23:59,086
Yes, I remember.

154
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,381
Do you see that map, Maximus?

155
00:24:05,184 --> 00:24:07,722
That is the world which I created.

156
00:24:08,604 --> 00:24:10,182
<i>For 25 years...</i>

157
00:24:10,773 --> 00:24:14,641
I have conquered, spilt blood,
expanded the empire.

158
00:24:16,028 --> 00:24:19,860
Since I became Caesar,
I've known four years without war.

159
00:24:19,949 --> 00:24:22,405
Four years of peace in 20.

160
00:24:22,702 --> 00:24:24,196
<i>And for what?</i>

161
00:24:31,627 --> 00:24:35,411
I brought the sword. Nothing more.

162
00:24:36,716 --> 00:24:37,996
Caesar, your life...

163
00:24:38,092 --> 00:24:40,666
Please. Please don't call me that.

164
00:24:40,928 --> 00:24:43,217
Come. Please.

165
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:45,390
Come sit.

166
00:24:46,225 --> 00:24:48,930
<i>Let us talk together now...</i>

167
00:24:49,812 --> 00:24:51,935
<i>very simply, as men.</i>

168
00:24:52,607 --> 00:24:54,434
Well, Maximus...

169
00:24:56,819 --> 00:24:57,982
talk.

170
00:25:00,948 --> 00:25:03,819
5,000 of my men are out there
in the freezing mud.

171
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:07,534
3,000 of them are bloodied and cleaved.
2,000 will never leave this place.

172
00:25:07,622 --> 00:25:10,658
I will not believe that they fought
and died for nothing.

173
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,374
And what would you believe?

174
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:16,292
They fought for you and for Rome.

175
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:18,172
And what is Rome, Maximus?

176
00:25:20,343 --> 00:25:22,750
I've seen much of the rest of the world.

177
00:25:22,845 --> 00:25:26,843
It is brutal and cruel and dark.
Rome is the light.

178
00:25:26,933 --> 00:25:28,842
Yet you have never been there.

179
00:25:28,935 --> 00:25:31,342
You have not seen what it has become.

180
00:25:31,479 --> 00:25:34,515
I am dying, Maximus.

181
00:25:35,191 --> 00:25:36,851
<i>When a man sees his end...</i>

182
00:25:36,943 --> 00:25:40,027
<i>he wants to know there was some purpose
to his life.</i>

183
00:25:40,696 --> 00:25:43,816
How will the world speak my name
in years to come?

184
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:46,238
Will I be known as the philosopher?

185
00:25:46,327 --> 00:25:47,786
The warrior?

186
00:25:48,121 --> 00:25:49,531
The tyrant?

187
00:25:50,957 --> 00:25:55,583
Or will I be the Emperor
who gave Rome back her true self?

188
00:25:56,671 --> 00:25:58,960
There was once a dream
that was Rome.

189
00:25:59,048 --> 00:26:01,883
You could only whisper it.

190
00:26:01,968 --> 00:26:05,134
Anything more than a whisper
and it would vanish...

191
00:26:05,221 --> 00:26:06,964
it was so fragile.

192
00:26:07,306 --> 00:26:11,007
And I fear that it will not survive the winter.

193
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,979
Maximus...

194
00:26:14,897 --> 00:26:17,815
let us whisper now...

195
00:26:18,067 --> 00:26:19,811
together, you and I.

196
00:26:20,528 --> 00:26:22,022
You have a son.

197
00:26:23,573 --> 00:26:25,400
Tell me about your home.

198
00:26:31,622 --> 00:26:34,493
My house is in the hills above Trujillo.

199
00:26:35,918 --> 00:26:37,662
A very simple place.

200
00:26:38,087 --> 00:26:41,041
<i>Pink stones that warm in the sun.</i>

201
00:26:41,132 --> 00:26:44,583
A kitchen garden
that smells of herbs in the day...

202
00:26:45,344 --> 00:26:47,254
jasmine in the evening.

203
00:26:48,931 --> 00:26:51,505
Through the gate is a giant poplar.

204
00:26:51,809 --> 00:26:54,644
Figs, apples, pears.

205
00:26:54,729 --> 00:26:58,596
The soil, Marcus, black.
Black like my wife's hair.

206
00:26:59,609 --> 00:27:01,767
Grapes on the south slopes,
olives on the north.

207
00:27:01,861 --> 00:27:04,103
Wild ponies play near my house.
They tease my son.

208
00:27:04,197 --> 00:27:05,821
He wants to be one of them.

209
00:27:05,907 --> 00:27:07,734
When was the last time you were home?

210
00:27:07,825 --> 00:27:10,910
Two years, 264 days and this morning.

211
00:27:12,538 --> 00:27:15,824
I envy you, Maximus. It's a good home.

212
00:27:17,543 --> 00:27:19,251
Worth fighting for.

213
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:24,213
There is one more duty...

214
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:27,511
that I ask of you before you go home.

215
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:31,553
What would you have me do, Caesar?

216
00:27:31,641 --> 00:27:35,259
I want you to become
the protector of Rome after I die.

217
00:27:36,437 --> 00:27:39,438
I will empower you to one end alone...

218
00:27:39,982 --> 00:27:43,482
to give power back to the people of Rome...

219
00:27:43,778 --> 00:27:46,862
and end the corruption that has crippled it.

220
00:27:53,121 --> 00:27:56,786
Will you accept this great honor
that I have offered you?

221
00:27:58,251 --> 00:28:00,160
With all my heart, no.

222
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:04,374
Maximus...

223
00:28:04,966 --> 00:28:07,883
that is why it must be you.

224
00:28:07,969 --> 00:28:10,045
But surely a prefect, a senator...

225
00:28:10,138 --> 00:28:12,711
somebody who knows the city,
who understands her politics.

226
00:28:12,807 --> 00:28:16,010
But you have not been corrupted
by her politics.

227
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:24,558
- And Commodus?
- Commodus is not a moral man.

228
00:28:25,445 --> 00:28:27,983
You have known that since you were young.

229
00:28:28,197 --> 00:28:30,154
Commodus cannot rule.

230
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:32,613
He must not rule.

231
00:28:34,162 --> 00:28:36,949
You are the son that I should have had.

232
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:42,501
Commodus will accept my decision.

233
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:49,464
He knows that you command
the loyalty of the army.

234
00:28:54,432 --> 00:28:56,010
I need some time, sire.

235
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,559
Yes.

236
00:28:57,643 --> 00:29:01,226
By sunset, I hope you will have agreed.

237
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:04,431
Now embrace me as my son.

238
00:29:07,862 --> 00:29:10,567
And bring an old man another blanket.

239
00:29:26,839 --> 00:29:29,793
My father favors you now.
My lady.

240
00:29:29,884 --> 00:29:32,920
- It was not always so.
- Many things change.

241
00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:36,346
Many things. Not everything.

242
00:29:39,268 --> 00:29:40,928
Maximus, stop.

243
00:29:44,482 --> 00:29:46,391
Let me see your face.

244
00:29:48,986 --> 00:29:51,904
You seem upset.
I lost many men.

245
00:29:52,573 --> 00:29:54,899
What did my father want with you?

246
00:29:55,993 --> 00:29:58,947
To wish me well before I leave for home.

247
00:29:59,622 --> 00:30:01,116
You're lying.

248
00:30:01,207 --> 00:30:04,790
<i>I could always tell when you were lying
because you were never any good at it.</i>

249
00:30:04,877 --> 00:30:07,415
- I never acquired your comfort with it.
- True.

250
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:09,628
But then you never had to.

251
00:30:10,133 --> 00:30:12,837
Life is more simple for a soldier.

252
00:30:14,637 --> 00:30:16,843
Or do you think me heartless?

253
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:20,600
I think you have a talent for survival.

254
00:30:26,607 --> 00:30:28,150
Maximus, stop.

255
00:30:30,486 --> 00:30:32,977
Is it really so terrible seeing me again?

256
00:30:33,322 --> 00:30:35,813
No. I'm tired from battle.

257
00:30:36,451 --> 00:30:39,368
It hurts you to see
my father so fragile.

258
00:30:42,373 --> 00:30:46,453
Commodus expects that my father will
announce his succession within days.

259
00:30:47,962 --> 00:30:51,378
Will you serve my brother
as you served his father?

260
00:30:53,509 --> 00:30:55,668
I will always serve Rome.

261
00:30:57,597 --> 00:30:59,424
Do you know...

262
00:30:59,515 --> 00:31:02,006
I still remember you in my prayers.

263
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:05,931
Oh, yes. I pray.

264
00:31:10,526 --> 00:31:13,812
I was sad to hear of your husband's death.
I mourned him.

265
00:31:15,698 --> 00:31:18,533
- Thank you.
- And I hear you have a son.

266
00:31:20,203 --> 00:31:22,610
Yes. Lucius.

267
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:26,199
He'll be nearly eight years old.

268
00:31:26,292 --> 00:31:28,534
My son is also nearly eight.

269
00:31:31,339 --> 00:31:33,711
I thank you for your prayers.

270
00:31:41,265 --> 00:31:43,887
Ancestors,
I ask for your guidance.

271
00:31:45,186 --> 00:31:48,721
<i>Blessed Mother, come to me
with the gods' desire for my future.</i>

272
00:31:50,316 --> 00:31:54,100
Blessed Father, watch over my wife and son
with a ready sword.

273
00:31:55,321 --> 00:31:58,607
Whisper to them,
I live only to hold them again.

274
00:31:59,325 --> 00:32:01,484
<i>Ancestors, I honor you...</i>

275
00:32:02,704 --> 00:32:05,989
and will try to live
with the dignity you have taught me.

276
00:32:28,896 --> 00:32:30,272
Cicero.

277
00:32:34,694 --> 00:32:35,808
Sir.

278
00:32:40,283 --> 00:32:42,821
Do you ever find it hard to do your duty?

279
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:48,153
Sometimes I do what I want to do.

280
00:32:48,875 --> 00:32:51,662
The rest of the time, I do what I have to.

281
00:32:54,422 --> 00:32:57,339
We may not be able to go home, after all.

282
00:33:48,434 --> 00:33:51,221
Are you ready to do your duty
for Rome?

283
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:55,774
Yes, Father.

284
00:33:56,901 --> 00:33:58,977
You will not be emperor.

285
00:34:02,198 --> 00:34:04,654
Which wiser, older man is to take my place?

286
00:34:04,742 --> 00:34:07,280
My powers will pass to Maximus...

287
00:34:08,496 --> 00:34:10,239
to hold in trust...

288
00:34:10,331 --> 00:34:14,080
until the Senate is ready to rule once more.

289
00:34:15,628 --> 00:34:19,079
Rome is to be a republic again.

290
00:34:21,008 --> 00:34:23,582
Maximus.
Yes.

291
00:34:29,726 --> 00:34:31,932
My decision disappoints you?

292
00:34:35,481 --> 00:34:37,521
You wrote to me once...

293
00:34:39,402 --> 00:34:41,809
listing the four chief virtues:

294
00:34:43,573 --> 00:34:44,853
Wisdom...

295
00:34:45,033 --> 00:34:46,408
justice...

296
00:34:46,617 --> 00:34:48,076
fortitude...

297
00:34:48,453 --> 00:34:50,244
and temperance.

298
00:34:52,415 --> 00:34:55,535
As I read the list, I knew I had none of them.

299
00:34:56,502 --> 00:34:58,958
But I have other virtues, Father.

300
00:35:00,173 --> 00:35:01,501
Ambition.

301
00:35:02,717 --> 00:35:05,718
That can be a virtue
when it drives us to excel.

302
00:35:07,055 --> 00:35:10,139
Resourcefulness, courage.

303
00:35:11,225 --> 00:35:15,519
Perhaps not on the battlefield,
but there are many forms of courage.

304
00:35:17,148 --> 00:35:20,398
Devotion to my family...

305
00:35:21,527 --> 00:35:22,903
to you.

306
00:35:24,405 --> 00:35:27,192
But none of my virtues were on your list.

307
00:35:29,452 --> 00:35:32,619
Even then it was as if
you didn't want me for your son.

308
00:35:32,872 --> 00:35:34,200
Commodus...

309
00:35:35,124 --> 00:35:36,784
you go too far.

310
00:35:37,585 --> 00:35:40,586
I searched the faces of the gods...

311
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:45,716
for ways to please you, to make you proud.

312
00:35:46,594 --> 00:35:48,587
<i>One kind word...</i>

313
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:50,887
one full hug...

314
00:35:51,099 --> 00:35:54,764
where you pressed me to your chest
and held me tight...

315
00:35:55,895 --> 00:35:59,430
would have been like the sun on my heart
for 1,000 years.

316
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:04,731
What is it in me you hate
so much?

317
00:36:04,821 --> 00:36:05,983
Commodus.

318
00:36:07,073 --> 00:36:09,196
All I've ever wanted...

319
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:13,697
was to live up to you, Caesar.

320
00:36:14,997 --> 00:36:17,571
Father.
Commodus...

321
00:36:22,046 --> 00:36:24,169
your faults as a son...

322
00:36:25,133 --> 00:36:28,418
is my failure as a father.

323
00:36:39,188 --> 00:36:40,647
Come.

324
00:36:44,235 --> 00:36:45,694
Father.

325
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:03,290
I would butcher the whole world...

326
00:37:04,213 --> 00:37:06,669
if you would only have loved me!

327
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:47,254
Maximus, the Emperor needs you.
It's urgent.

328
00:37:52,887 --> 00:37:54,714
Lament with me, brother.

329
00:37:55,807 --> 00:37:57,764
Our great father is dead.

330
00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:26,210
How did he die?

331
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:30,049
The surgeons say
there was no pain.

332
00:38:30,174 --> 00:38:32,250
<i>His breath gave out as he slept.</i>

333
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:43,395
Father.

334
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:48,561
Your emperor asks for your loyalty,
Maximus.

335
00:38:49,944 --> 00:38:51,569
Take my hand.

336
00:38:54,282 --> 00:38:56,109
<i>I only offer it once.</i>

337
00:39:10,298 --> 00:39:11,709
Quintus.

338
00:40:01,849 --> 00:40:03,391
Hail, Caesar.

339
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:06,931
I must talk to the senators.
I need their counsel.

340
00:40:07,021 --> 00:40:09,595
- Wake Gaius and Falco.
- Gaius and Falco.

341
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:11,932
Sword.

342
00:40:14,445 --> 00:40:17,316
Maximus, please be careful.
That was not prudent.

343
00:40:17,407 --> 00:40:20,443
Prudent? The Emperor has been slain.

344
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:23,281
The Emperor died
of natural causes.

345
00:40:24,914 --> 00:40:27,156
- Why are you armed, Quintus?
- Guards!

346
00:40:30,336 --> 00:40:32,578
Please don't fight, Maximus.

347
00:40:34,298 --> 00:40:36,587
<i>I'm sorry. Caesar has spoken.</i>

348
00:40:37,051 --> 00:40:38,878
Ride until dawn...

349
00:40:40,096 --> 00:40:41,638
and then execute him.

350
00:40:41,723 --> 00:40:44,130
Quintus, look at me. Look at me!

351
00:40:44,434 --> 00:40:47,304
Promise me
that you will look after my family.

352
00:40:48,438 --> 00:40:51,107
Your family will meet you in the afterlife.

353
00:41:15,965 --> 00:41:17,163
Kneel.

354
00:41:20,762 --> 00:41:23,087
<i>Blessed Father,
watch over my wife and son.</i>

355
00:41:23,181 --> 00:41:26,265
<i>Whisper to them
that I live only to hold them again.</i>

356
00:41:28,936 --> 00:41:31,262
At least give me a clean death.

357
00:41:32,982 --> 00:41:34,773
A soldier's death.

358
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:59,297
The frost,
sometimes it makes the blade stick.

359
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:21,315
Praetorian!

360
00:43:40,985 --> 00:43:42,978
<i>When was the last time
you were home?</i>

361
00:43:43,071 --> 00:43:46,107
<i>Two years,
264 days and this morning.</i>

362
00:43:47,617 --> 00:43:49,574
<i>Blessed Father,
watch over my wife and son...</i>

363
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:51,986
<i>I will try to live
with the dignity you have taught me.</i>

364
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:54,487
<i>Whisper to them,
I live only to hold them again.</i>

365
00:43:54,582 --> 00:43:57,155
<i>... with a ready sword,
for all else is dust and air.</i>

366
00:43:57,251 --> 00:44:00,252
<i>Whisper to them,
I live only to hold them again.</i>

367
00:44:00,338 --> 00:44:02,627
<i>For all else is dust and air.</i>

368
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:04,893
Papa!

369
00:47:48,983 --> 00:47:50,477
Don't die.

370
00:47:56,824 --> 00:47:58,900
<i>You'll meet them again.</i>

371
00:48:00,536 --> 00:48:01,817
<i>Not yet.</i>

372
00:48:10,421 --> 00:48:14,170
No. They will clean it. Wait and see.

373
00:48:48,543 --> 00:48:49,918
Don't die.

374
00:48:50,712 --> 00:48:53,084
They'll feed you to the lions.

375
00:48:53,214 --> 00:48:55,456
They are worth more than we are.

376
00:49:05,476 --> 00:49:06,935
Better now?

377
00:49:08,062 --> 00:49:09,971
Clean. You see?

378
00:49:40,678 --> 00:49:43,513
Proximo! My old friend.

379
00:49:44,932 --> 00:49:47,969
<i>Every day is a great day when you are here...</i>

380
00:49:48,436 --> 00:49:52,599
but today is your most fortunate day.

381
00:49:55,276 --> 00:49:58,977
Those giraffes you sold me,
they won't mate.

382
00:49:59,614 --> 00:50:03,481
They just walk around eating
and not mating.

383
00:50:04,786 --> 00:50:07,703
You sold me queer giraffes.

384
00:50:08,623 --> 00:50:11,292
- I want my money back.
- Not a chance.

385
00:50:14,879 --> 00:50:18,248
I do special price for you.
On what?

386
00:50:19,801 --> 00:50:22,718
Have you seen my new stock?
Come and see them.

387
00:50:36,651 --> 00:50:39,486
Do any of them fight?
I've got a match coming up.

388
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:42,192
Some are good for fighting,
others for dying.

389
00:50:42,407 --> 00:50:44,732
You need both, I think.

390
00:50:44,826 --> 00:50:46,024
Get up.

391
00:50:54,043 --> 00:50:55,870
What's your trade?

392
00:50:56,337 --> 00:50:57,666
I was a hunter.

393
00:50:57,755 --> 00:51:01,420
No, I bought him from a salt mine
in Carthage.

394
00:51:02,218 --> 00:51:03,593
Sit down.

395
00:51:07,473 --> 00:51:08,718
Mark of the legion.

396
00:51:10,017 --> 00:51:13,137
Deserter.
Maybe so, but who cares?

397
00:51:13,229 --> 00:51:14,344
He's a Spaniard.

398
00:51:14,439 --> 00:51:16,348
I'll take six. For 1,000.

399
00:51:16,441 --> 00:51:20,023
One thousand?
The Numidian alone is worth 2,000.

400
00:51:20,111 --> 00:51:22,104
These slaves are rotten.

401
00:51:22,196 --> 00:51:25,363
It all adds to the flavor. No, wait!

402
00:51:25,908 --> 00:51:27,616
I can negotiate.

403
00:51:28,703 --> 00:51:32,783
I'll give you 2,000, and 4,000 for the beasts.

404
00:51:32,957 --> 00:51:35,116
<i>That's 5,000 for an old friend.</i>

405
00:51:52,727 --> 00:51:55,930
Come on! How long does it take
to get into my own house?

406
00:51:56,230 --> 00:51:58,140
I am Proximo.

407
00:51:58,733 --> 00:52:01,402
I shall be closer to you
for the next few days...

408
00:52:01,486 --> 00:52:03,727
which will be the last
of your miserable lives...

409
00:52:03,821 --> 00:52:07,819
than that bitch of a mother
that brought you screaming into this world.

410
00:52:08,451 --> 00:52:11,784
<i>I did not pay good money for you
for your company.</i>

411
00:52:12,955 --> 00:52:16,159
I paid it so that I could profit
from your death.

412
00:52:16,918 --> 00:52:20,666
<i>And as your mother was there
at your beginning...</i>

413
00:52:21,672 --> 00:52:24,294
so I shall be there at your end.

414
00:52:25,843 --> 00:52:28,797
And when you die, and die you shall...

415
00:52:29,764 --> 00:52:32,681
your transition shall be to the sound of...

416
00:52:37,355 --> 00:52:38,814
Gladiators...

417
00:52:39,982 --> 00:52:41,477
I salute you.

418
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:47,525
Red.

419
00:52:50,952 --> 00:52:52,280
Yellow.

420
00:52:53,454 --> 00:52:54,699
Yellow.

421
00:53:05,466 --> 00:53:06,664
Good.

422
00:53:07,343 --> 00:53:08,506
Red.

423
00:53:13,641 --> 00:53:14,970
Spaniard.

424
00:53:48,342 --> 00:53:50,668
That's enough for the moment!

425
00:53:51,012 --> 00:53:52,589
His time will come.

426
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:56,679
Next.

427
00:54:10,073 --> 00:54:11,353
Spaniard...

428
00:54:12,867 --> 00:54:14,694
why don't you fight?

429
00:54:15,036 --> 00:54:16,530
We all have to fight.

430
00:54:16,621 --> 00:54:18,530
Well, I don't fight.

431
00:54:18,956 --> 00:54:22,207
I shouldn't be here, I'm a scribe,
I write down words...

432
00:54:22,293 --> 00:54:24,202
and speak seven languages.

433
00:54:24,295 --> 00:54:25,493
Good.

434
00:54:26,214 --> 00:54:29,250
Tomorrow, you can scream
in seven languages.

435
00:54:37,558 --> 00:54:41,141
Perhaps the scribe will be the one
who wins his freedom.

436
00:54:41,896 --> 00:54:43,141
Freedom?

437
00:54:44,273 --> 00:54:46,065
What do I have to do?

438
00:54:46,484 --> 00:54:48,773
You go in the arena and you kill me.

439
00:54:48,903 --> 00:54:50,278
And him...

440
00:54:51,239 --> 00:54:52,781
and the Numidian...

441
00:54:53,074 --> 00:54:54,616
and the deserter.

442
00:54:56,244 --> 00:54:57,738
And 100 more.

443
00:54:57,829 --> 00:55:00,580
And when there's no more to fight,
you're free.

444
00:55:01,249 --> 00:55:02,992
I can't do that.

445
00:55:04,085 --> 00:55:05,248
No?

446
00:55:11,509 --> 00:55:12,920
But I can.

447
00:55:28,443 --> 00:55:30,649
Is that the sign of your gods?

448
00:55:35,867 --> 00:55:37,943
Will that not anger them?

449
00:55:59,307 --> 00:56:00,967
The gods favor you.

450
00:56:01,309 --> 00:56:03,467
Red is the gods' color.

451
00:56:04,854 --> 00:56:07,060
You will need their help today.

452
00:56:46,396 --> 00:56:48,020
Proximo!

453
00:56:53,361 --> 00:56:55,519
Still leading with the German?

454
00:56:55,613 --> 00:56:57,736
The crowd love a barbarian.

455
00:56:58,199 --> 00:57:00,108
Besides that, he's making me rich.

456
00:57:00,201 --> 00:57:02,774
Has that Numidian fought before?

457
00:57:03,621 --> 00:57:05,199
No, first time.

458
00:57:05,289 --> 00:57:08,243
And that one, laborer, soldier?

459
00:57:08,710 --> 00:57:13,039
He's a Spaniard. He might as well
be a eunuch, for what he brings to the ring.

460
00:57:14,048 --> 00:57:18,260
Five hundred sestertii, the Numidian
and Spaniard team makes it through.

461
00:57:18,386 --> 00:57:22,051
<i>And 1,000,
that the Numidian makes it through alone.</i>

462
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:26,719
Are you asking me
to bet against my own man?

463
00:57:28,563 --> 00:57:29,891
It's unethical.

464
00:57:30,106 --> 00:57:31,980
What if I make it 2,000?

465
00:57:46,330 --> 00:57:49,331
Some of you are thinking you won't fight...

466
00:57:50,626 --> 00:57:52,619
some that you can't fight.

467
00:57:53,421 --> 00:57:56,920
They all say that until they're out there.

468
00:57:59,594 --> 00:58:00,792
Listen.

469
00:58:01,596 --> 00:58:04,265
Kill!

470
00:58:10,855 --> 00:58:13,607
Thrust this into another man's flesh...

471
00:58:13,983 --> 00:58:16,652
and they will applaud and love you for that.

472
00:58:16,778 --> 00:58:18,153
And you...

473
00:58:20,156 --> 00:58:22,113
you may begin to love them...

474
00:58:22,950 --> 00:58:24,326
for that.

475
00:58:28,539 --> 00:58:32,039
Ultimately, we're all dead men.

476
00:58:34,504 --> 00:58:36,792
Sadly, we cannot choose how...

477
00:58:37,924 --> 00:58:40,675
but we can decide how we meet that end...

478
00:58:41,719 --> 00:58:44,210
in order that we are remembered...

479
00:58:46,182 --> 00:58:47,345
as men.

480
00:58:47,433 --> 00:58:48,512
Come on!

481
00:58:51,521 --> 00:58:53,893
On the left, draw your shields!

482
00:58:54,857 --> 00:58:57,229
<i>On the right, draw your swords!</i>

483
00:58:57,902 --> 00:58:59,978
Kill! Kill!

484
00:59:01,197 --> 00:59:03,569
<i>Pair them up: Red with yellow.</i>

485
00:59:08,663 --> 00:59:09,825
Next!

486
00:59:15,712 --> 00:59:16,910
Move!

487
01:02:33,910 --> 01:02:35,108
Usurper!

488
01:02:57,892 --> 01:03:01,012
Go away!
You'll never rule us, Commodus!

489
01:03:30,967 --> 01:03:35,676
He enters Rome like a conquering hero.
But what has he conquered?

490
01:03:35,972 --> 01:03:38,261
Give him time, Gracchus. He's young.

491
01:03:38,474 --> 01:03:40,633
I think he could do very well.

492
01:03:41,144 --> 01:03:43,183
For Rome, or for you?

493
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:52,694
Go to your mother, Lucius.
It's what she'd like.

494
01:03:58,953 --> 01:04:00,946
Lucius!
Mother!

495
01:04:03,166 --> 01:04:04,660
Hail, Caesar.

496
01:04:04,876 --> 01:04:06,370
Senators.

497
01:04:10,048 --> 01:04:12,965
Rome greets her new emperor.

498
01:04:13,051 --> 01:04:16,550
Your loyal subjects bid you welcome,
Highness.

499
01:04:16,679 --> 01:04:18,506
Thank you, Falco.

500
01:04:18,639 --> 01:04:22,684
And for the loyal subjects,
I trust they weren't too expensive.

501
01:04:22,769 --> 01:04:24,808
Caesar.
Gracchus.

502
01:04:24,896 --> 01:04:27,351
All Rome rejoices in your return, Caesar.

503
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:30,643
There are many matters
that require your attention.

504
01:04:33,404 --> 01:04:36,239
To order, please. To order.

505
01:04:36,741 --> 01:04:41,367
For your guidance, Caesar, the Senate
has prepared a series of protocols...

506
01:04:41,496 --> 01:04:44,532
to begin addressing the many problems
in the city...

507
01:04:44,665 --> 01:04:48,710
beginning with basic sanitation
for the Greek Quarter...

508
01:04:49,253 --> 01:04:52,539
to combat the plague
which is already springing up there.

509
01:04:52,924 --> 01:04:54,715
So, if Caesar...

510
01:04:56,886 --> 01:04:58,760
Don't you see, Gracchus?

511
01:05:00,181 --> 01:05:02,506
That's the very problem, isn't it?

512
01:05:02,892 --> 01:05:05,810
My father spent all his time
at study...

513
01:05:07,355 --> 01:05:10,724
at books of learning and philosophy.

514
01:05:11,734 --> 01:05:15,684
He spent his twilight hours
reading scrolls from the Senate.

515
01:05:16,197 --> 01:05:19,364
And all the while, the people were forgotten.

516
01:05:20,034 --> 01:05:22,193
But the Senate is the people, sire...

517
01:05:22,286 --> 01:05:25,786
chosen from among the people
to speak for the people.

518
01:05:26,416 --> 01:05:30,034
I doubt many of the people
eat so well as you do, Gracchus.

519
01:05:30,878 --> 01:05:33,369
Or have such splendid mistresses, Gaius.

520
01:05:33,464 --> 01:05:35,587
I think I understand my own people.

521
01:05:35,675 --> 01:05:39,126
Then perhaps Caesar will be so good
as to teach us...

522
01:05:39,470 --> 01:05:42,092
out of his own extensive experience.

523
01:05:46,060 --> 01:05:47,602
I call it love.

524
01:05:48,104 --> 01:05:51,271
<i>I am their father.
The people are my children.</i>

525
01:05:51,566 --> 01:05:54,187
I shall hold them to my bosom
and embrace them tightly.

526
01:05:54,277 --> 01:05:57,313
Have you ever embraced
someone dying of plague, sire?

527
01:06:03,911 --> 01:06:06,485
No, but if you interrupt me again...

528
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:09,374
I assure you that you shall.

529
01:06:09,459 --> 01:06:11,784
Senator, my brother is very tired.

530
01:06:12,795 --> 01:06:16,959
Leave your list with me.
Caesar shall do all that Rome requires.

531
01:06:17,508 --> 01:06:22,466
My lady, as always,
your lightest touch commands obedience.

532
01:06:29,604 --> 01:06:31,929
Who are they to lecture me?

533
01:06:32,148 --> 01:06:34,639
Commodus, the Senate has its uses.

534
01:06:34,776 --> 01:06:37,646
What uses? All they do is talk.

535
01:06:38,821 --> 01:06:43,448
It should be just you and me and Rome.

536
01:06:43,534 --> 01:06:46,820
Don't even think it.
There's always been a Senate.

537
01:06:47,330 --> 01:06:48,990
Rome has changed.

538
01:06:49,082 --> 01:06:52,118
It takes an emperor to rule an empire.

539
01:06:52,460 --> 01:06:54,334
Of course, but leave the people their...

540
01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:55,962
Illusions?

541
01:06:57,548 --> 01:06:59,007
Traditions.

542
01:06:59,842 --> 01:07:02,677
My father's war against the barbarians...

543
01:07:03,221 --> 01:07:06,886
He said it himself: It achieved nothing.
But the people loved him.

544
01:07:06,974 --> 01:07:08,884
The people always love victories.

545
01:07:08,976 --> 01:07:12,642
Why? They didn't see the battles.

546
01:07:13,981 --> 01:07:15,974
What do they care about Germania?

547
01:07:16,067 --> 01:07:18,356
They care about the greatness of Rome.

548
01:07:18,444 --> 01:07:20,353
"The greatness of Rome."

549
01:07:22,323 --> 01:07:24,067
Well, what is that?

550
01:07:26,828 --> 01:07:30,031
It's an idea. Greatness.

551
01:07:33,835 --> 01:07:37,286
Greatness is a vision.
Exactly. A vision.

552
01:07:39,340 --> 01:07:41,214
Do you not see, Lucilla?

553
01:07:42,593 --> 01:07:46,543
I will give the people a vision of Rome,
and they'll love me for it.

554
01:07:47,223 --> 01:07:51,600
And they'll soon forget the tedious
sermonizing of a few dry old men.

555
01:08:03,030 --> 01:08:06,364
I will give the people
the greatest vision of their lives.

556
01:08:57,585 --> 01:09:00,705
White and red wine
for your drinking pleasure!

557
01:09:08,763 --> 01:09:09,926
Games.

558
01:09:12,266 --> 01:09:15,303
One hundred and fifty days of games.

559
01:09:15,770 --> 01:09:17,430
He's cleverer than I thought.

560
01:09:17,522 --> 01:09:21,021
Clever. The whole of Rome
would be laughing at him...

561
01:09:21,776 --> 01:09:24,018
if they weren't so afraid of his Praetorians.

562
01:09:24,112 --> 01:09:26,947
Fear and wonder. A powerful combination.

563
01:09:28,324 --> 01:09:31,444
You really think the people
are going to be seduced by that?

564
01:09:31,536 --> 01:09:34,620
I think he knows what Rome is.
Rome is the mob.

565
01:09:35,331 --> 01:09:38,451
Conjure magic for them,
and they'll be distracted.

566
01:09:39,043 --> 01:09:42,293
Take away their freedom,
and still they'll roar.

567
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:47,293
The beating heart of Rome
is not the marble of the Senate.

568
01:09:47,385 --> 01:09:49,377
It's the sand of the Colosseum.

569
01:09:51,305 --> 01:09:53,345
He'll bring them death...

570
01:09:55,143 --> 01:09:57,468
and they will love him for it.

571
01:10:20,209 --> 01:10:22,249
All you do is kill, kill, kill.

572
01:10:22,336 --> 01:10:24,744
The crowd don't want a butcher,
they want a hero.

573
01:10:24,839 --> 01:10:26,915
We want them to keep coming back.

574
01:10:27,008 --> 01:10:31,171
So don't just hack them to pieces,
remember you are an entertainer.

575
01:10:33,765 --> 01:10:35,093
Spaniard.

576
01:10:42,940 --> 01:10:44,435
So entertain!

577
01:11:49,590 --> 01:11:53,671
Are you not entertained?

578
01:11:56,013 --> 01:11:58,255
Is this not why you're here?

579
01:12:02,854 --> 01:12:05,261
Spaniard!

580
01:12:23,124 --> 01:12:24,867
What do you want?

581
01:12:27,462 --> 01:12:28,624
<i>Girl?</i>

582
01:12:29,672 --> 01:12:30,787
<i>Boy?</i>

583
01:12:31,716 --> 01:12:33,958
- You sent for me.
- Yes, I did.

584
01:12:35,053 --> 01:12:38,137
You're good, Spaniard,
but you're not that good.

585
01:12:38,222 --> 01:12:39,633
You could be magnificent.

586
01:12:39,724 --> 01:12:42,974
I'm required to kill, so I kill. That is enough.

587
01:12:43,811 --> 01:12:46,896
That's enough for the provinces,
but not for Rome.

588
01:12:50,318 --> 01:12:54,185
The young emperor
has arranged a series of spectacles...

589
01:12:54,322 --> 01:12:58,485
to commemorate his father,
Marcus Aurelius.

590
01:12:58,993 --> 01:13:00,986
<i>I find that amusing...</i>

591
01:13:01,329 --> 01:13:04,365
since it was Marcus Aurelius, the wise...

592
01:13:04,499 --> 01:13:07,915
the all-knowing Marcus Aurelius,
that closed us down.

593
01:13:10,922 --> 01:13:15,050
So finally,
after five years of scratching a living...

594
01:13:15,176 --> 01:13:17,334
in flea-infested villages...

595
01:13:17,428 --> 01:13:20,513
we're finally going back to where we belong:

596
01:13:21,224 --> 01:13:22,766
The Colosseum.

597
01:13:25,019 --> 01:13:27,806
You should see the Colosseum, Spaniard.

598
01:13:29,148 --> 01:13:31,224
Fifty-thousand Romans...

599
01:13:32,151 --> 01:13:35,983
watching every movement of your sword...

600
01:13:37,407 --> 01:13:39,862
willing you to make that killer blow.

601
01:13:41,077 --> 01:13:44,742
The silence before you strike
and the noise afterwards.

602
01:13:45,707 --> 01:13:49,325
It rises. It rises up...

603
01:13:50,878 --> 01:13:52,503
like a storm.

604
01:13:52,964 --> 01:13:55,371
As if you were the thunder god himself.

605
01:13:55,675 --> 01:13:58,676
- You were a gladiator?
- Yes, I was.

606
01:14:05,101 --> 01:14:07,177
You won your freedom?

607
01:14:07,353 --> 01:14:09,761
A long time ago, the Emperor...

608
01:14:11,399 --> 01:14:13,557
presented me with a rudius.

609
01:14:15,319 --> 01:14:17,146
It's just a wooden sword.

610
01:14:17,989 --> 01:14:20,231
<i>The symbol of your freedom.</i>

611
01:14:22,410 --> 01:14:25,446
He touched me on the shoulder,
and I was free.

612
01:14:26,789 --> 01:14:29,197
You knew Marcus Aurelius?

613
01:14:29,292 --> 01:14:33,124
I did not say I knew him.
I said he touched me on the shoulder once.

614
01:14:34,172 --> 01:14:36,330
You asked me what I want.

615
01:14:37,592 --> 01:14:40,546
I, too, want to stand
in front of the Emperor...

616
01:14:41,804 --> 01:14:43,215
as you did.

617
01:14:43,306 --> 01:14:46,722
Then listen to me. Learn from me.

618
01:14:47,602 --> 01:14:50,686
I wasn't the best because I killed quickly.

619
01:14:51,856 --> 01:14:54,525
I was the best because the crowd loved me.

620
01:14:55,651 --> 01:14:58,937
Win the crowd, and you'll win your freedom.

621
01:15:03,409 --> 01:15:05,283
I will win the crowd.

622
01:15:07,538 --> 01:15:10,575
I will give them something
they've never seen before.

623
01:15:12,001 --> 01:15:15,121
So, Spaniard,
we shall go to Rome together...

624
01:15:15,671 --> 01:15:17,463
and have bloody adventures.

625
01:15:17,548 --> 01:15:19,541
And the great whore
will suckle us...

626
01:15:19,634 --> 01:15:22,041
until we are fat and happy
and can suckle no more.

627
01:15:22,136 --> 01:15:23,547
And then...

628
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:26,803
when enough men have died...

629
01:15:28,976 --> 01:15:31,432
perhaps you will have your freedom.

630
01:15:35,858 --> 01:15:38,230
Here. Use this.

631
01:16:01,926 --> 01:16:05,093
It's somewhere out there, my country.

632
01:16:06,180 --> 01:16:07,461
<i>My home.</i>

633
01:16:08,683 --> 01:16:10,806
My wife is preparing food.

634
01:16:11,811 --> 01:16:14,516
My daughters carry water from the river.

635
01:16:15,857 --> 01:16:17,896
Will I ever see them again?

636
01:16:19,152 --> 01:16:20,694
I think, no.

637
01:16:20,987 --> 01:16:23,442
Do you believe you'll see them again
when you die?

638
01:16:23,531 --> 01:16:24,942
I think so.

639
01:16:25,533 --> 01:16:28,617
But then, I will die soon.

640
01:16:30,246 --> 01:16:32,702
They will not die for many years.

641
01:16:33,499 --> 01:16:35,159
I'll have to wait.

642
01:16:35,251 --> 01:16:37,457
But you would? Wait?

643
01:16:38,087 --> 01:16:39,416
Of course.

644
01:16:41,340 --> 01:16:42,716
You see...

645
01:16:43,885 --> 01:16:45,260
my wife...

646
01:16:46,763 --> 01:16:50,677
and my son are already waiting for me.

647
01:16:51,434 --> 01:16:55,052
You'll meet them again. But not yet.

648
01:16:59,150 --> 01:17:00,478
Not yet.

649
01:17:02,070 --> 01:17:03,528
- Unless...
- Not yet.

650
01:17:07,742 --> 01:17:08,821
Not yet.

651
01:17:22,215 --> 01:17:23,495
There he is.

652
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:13,755
Out.

653
01:18:14,976 --> 01:18:16,885
<i>Move, go, out!</i>

654
01:18:29,615 --> 01:18:32,189
Good to see you again,
old friend.

655
01:18:37,457 --> 01:18:39,165
Bring me fortune.

656
01:18:43,755 --> 01:18:46,625
Have you ever seen anything
like that before?

657
01:18:47,717 --> 01:18:50,290
<i>I didn't know men could build such things.</i>

658
01:19:00,271 --> 01:19:01,813
Win the crowd.

659
01:19:02,065 --> 01:19:04,306
Get inside. Move.

660
01:19:04,484 --> 01:19:05,764
<i>Inside.</i>

661
01:19:54,992 --> 01:19:57,697
He sleeps so well because he's loved.

662
01:20:00,665 --> 01:20:02,741
Come, brother. It's late.

663
01:20:06,337 --> 01:20:09,255
I will make Rome
the wonder of the ages.

664
01:20:11,968 --> 01:20:15,301
That is what Gracchus and his friends
don't understand.

665
01:20:15,722 --> 01:20:19,007
All my desires
are splitting my head to pieces.

666
01:20:26,023 --> 01:20:28,728
Commodus, drink this tonic.

667
01:20:38,327 --> 01:20:40,949
I think the time is almost right.

668
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:43,951
I could announce
the dissolution of the Senate...

669
01:20:44,125 --> 01:20:46,201
at the celebration to honor our father.

670
01:20:46,294 --> 01:20:48,370
Do you think I should?

671
01:20:49,005 --> 01:20:51,044
Are the people ready?

672
01:20:53,051 --> 01:20:55,423
I think you need your rest now.

673
01:21:01,392 --> 01:21:03,184
Will you stay with me?

674
01:21:03,269 --> 01:21:05,677
Still afraid of the dark, brother?

675
01:21:12,445 --> 01:21:13,643
Still.

676
01:21:15,490 --> 01:21:16,770
Always.

677
01:21:18,493 --> 01:21:21,363
- Stay with me tonight.
- You know I won't.

678
01:21:25,875 --> 01:21:27,369
Then kiss me.

679
01:21:36,177 --> 01:21:37,755
Sleep, brother.

680
01:22:30,523 --> 01:22:32,646
Having servants who are deaf and mute...

681
01:22:32,734 --> 01:22:35,485
at least ensures I live a little longer.

682
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:39,605
They're arresting scholars now.

683
01:22:39,699 --> 01:22:43,531
Anyone who dare speak out.
Even satirists and chroniclers.

684
01:22:44,162 --> 01:22:46,071
And mathematicians.

685
01:22:47,290 --> 01:22:49,448
And all to feed the arena.

686
01:22:51,085 --> 01:22:53,623
The Senate did not approve martial law.

687
01:22:53,713 --> 01:22:56,916
This reign of terror
is entirely the Praetorians.

688
01:22:57,592 --> 01:22:59,715
I'm afraid to go out after dark.

689
01:22:59,802 --> 01:23:03,254
You should be more afraid
of your activities during the day.

690
01:23:03,473 --> 01:23:08,135
The Senate is full of his spies,
led by that whore master, Falco.

691
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:13,898
But what is in his mind?
That's what I trouble myself with.

692
01:23:14,692 --> 01:23:17,610
He spends all his days
singularly obsessed...

693
01:23:17,695 --> 01:23:20,530
planning the festival to honor your father.

694
01:23:20,615 --> 01:23:24,197
He neglects even the most fundamental task
of government.

695
01:23:24,952 --> 01:23:27,159
So just what is he planning?

696
01:23:27,538 --> 01:23:29,163
And what pays for it?

697
01:23:29,248 --> 01:23:33,460
These daily games are costing a fortune,
yet we have no new taxes.

698
01:23:34,212 --> 01:23:35,622
The future.

699
01:23:37,048 --> 01:23:39,040
The future pays for it.

700
01:23:40,510 --> 01:23:43,048
He's started selling the grain reserves.

701
01:23:43,513 --> 01:23:45,339
This can't be true.

702
01:23:45,932 --> 01:23:48,683
He's selling
Rome's reserves of grain.

703
01:23:49,018 --> 01:23:51,936
The people will be starving in two years.

704
01:23:52,480 --> 01:23:53,974
I hope they're enjoying the games...

705
01:23:54,065 --> 01:23:57,434
because soon enough
they'll be dead because of them.

706
01:23:57,777 --> 01:24:00,102
- Rome must know this.
- And how?

707
01:24:00,613 --> 01:24:02,985
He's going to dissolve the Senate.

708
01:24:03,574 --> 01:24:07,109
And who will tell them before it's too late?
You, Gracchus?

709
01:24:08,496 --> 01:24:09,990
You, Gaius.

710
01:24:10,081 --> 01:24:14,079
Will you make a speech on the floor
of the Senate, denouncing my brother?

711
01:24:14,168 --> 01:24:16,706
And then see your family in the Colosseum?

712
01:24:17,714 --> 01:24:19,042
Who'd dare?

713
01:24:28,224 --> 01:24:31,225
I have been living
in a prison of fear every day...

714
01:24:31,310 --> 01:24:33,932
because my son is heir to the throne.

715
01:24:39,569 --> 01:24:41,027
He must die.

716
01:24:45,408 --> 01:24:49,156
Quintus and the Praetorians
would simply seize control for themselves.

717
01:24:49,245 --> 01:24:53,077
No. Cut off the head
and the snake cannot strike.

718
01:24:53,166 --> 01:24:55,242
Lucilla, Gaius is right.

719
01:24:55,334 --> 01:24:59,463
Until we can neutralize the Praetorians,
we can achieve nothing.

720
01:25:01,007 --> 01:25:02,501
So we do nothing?

721
01:25:02,592 --> 01:25:05,379
No, child. We keep our counsel.

722
01:25:06,345 --> 01:25:07,756
We prepare.

723
01:25:08,598 --> 01:25:13,343
As long as the people support him,
we are voices without steel.

724
01:25:14,145 --> 01:25:15,556
We are air.

725
01:25:18,608 --> 01:25:21,359
But with every day that passes,
he makes enemies.

726
01:25:21,444 --> 01:25:24,314
One day,
he'll have more enemies than friends.

727
01:25:24,739 --> 01:25:27,693
And on that day, we will act.

728
01:25:28,284 --> 01:25:30,158
<i>Then we will strike.</i>

729
01:25:31,079 --> 01:25:32,822
But until then...

730
01:25:33,998 --> 01:25:35,540
we are docile.

731
01:25:36,042 --> 01:25:38,200
We are obedient.

732
01:25:39,796 --> 01:25:41,788
And we are treacherous.

733
01:25:50,431 --> 01:25:51,676
Come on!

734
01:26:00,441 --> 01:26:02,481
All right, that's enough.

735
01:26:25,049 --> 01:26:28,798
The Emperor wants battles, and I don't want
to sacrifice my best fighters.

736
01:26:28,886 --> 01:26:32,053
The crowd wants battles,
so the Emperor gives them battles.

737
01:26:32,140 --> 01:26:35,722
- You get the battle of Carthage.
- Massacre of Carthage.

738
01:26:37,311 --> 01:26:41,179
Well, why don't you go down to the prison,
round up all the beggars and thieves?

739
01:26:41,274 --> 01:26:42,436
We've done that.

740
01:26:42,525 --> 01:26:46,143
If you want to give away the best gladiators
in the whole of the empire...

741
01:26:46,237 --> 01:26:48,360
then I want double the rates.

742
01:26:48,448 --> 01:26:52,196
You'll get your contract rates,
or you'll get your contract cancelled.

743
01:26:52,285 --> 01:26:53,744
You don't like it?

744
01:26:53,828 --> 01:26:57,778
Then you can crawl back
down that shit hole that you came from.

745
01:27:00,877 --> 01:27:03,249
Cassius, please. You can free us.

746
01:27:32,909 --> 01:27:35,910
Gladiator, are you the one
they call the Spaniard?

747
01:27:36,079 --> 01:27:37,193
Yes.

748
01:27:37,997 --> 01:27:40,156
They said you were a giant.

749
01:27:40,291 --> 01:27:43,411
They said you could crush a man's skull
with one hand.

750
01:27:43,544 --> 01:27:45,288
A man's? No.

751
01:27:46,631 --> 01:27:47,911
A boy's.

752
01:27:49,967 --> 01:27:53,502
- Do they have good horses in Spain?
- Some of the best.

753
01:27:54,555 --> 01:27:57,640
This is Argento and this is Scarto.

754
01:27:59,018 --> 01:28:00,845
They were my horses.

755
01:28:01,771 --> 01:28:03,847
They were taken from me.

756
01:28:04,148 --> 01:28:07,434
I like you, Spaniard. I shall cheer for you.

757
01:28:07,985 --> 01:28:11,319
- They let you watch the games?
- My uncle says it makes me strong.

758
01:28:11,406 --> 01:28:14,691
- And what does your father say?
- My father is dead.

759
01:28:16,494 --> 01:28:18,534
Master Lucius, it is time.

760
01:28:19,831 --> 01:28:21,159
I have to go.

761
01:28:21,249 --> 01:28:22,826
Your name is Lucius?

762
01:28:24,961 --> 01:28:27,630
Lucius Verus, after my father.

763
01:28:58,244 --> 01:28:59,987
Lower!

764
01:29:05,126 --> 01:29:06,585
Claudius!

765
01:29:06,836 --> 01:29:09,244
Yes?
More shields!

766
01:29:09,338 --> 01:29:10,881
All right.

767
01:29:29,650 --> 01:29:34,396
When the Emperor enters,
raise your weapons, salute him...

768
01:29:34,489 --> 01:29:36,565
and then speak together.

769
01:29:37,325 --> 01:29:40,824
<i>Face the Emperor
and don't turn your back on him.</i>

770
01:29:41,913 --> 01:29:44,783
<i>Go, and die with honor.</i>

771
01:30:39,846 --> 01:30:41,922
Hail, mighty Caesar!

772
01:30:45,143 --> 01:30:49,390
Caesar!

773
01:30:52,442 --> 01:30:55,396
We who are about to die
salute you!

774
01:30:57,113 --> 01:30:58,821
On this day...

775
01:30:59,407 --> 01:31:02,443
we reach back to hallowed antiquity...

776
01:31:03,327 --> 01:31:06,946
to bring you a re-creation
of the second fall...

777
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:09,116
of mighty Carthage!

778
01:31:12,795 --> 01:31:17,173
On the barren plain of Zama...

779
01:31:17,842 --> 01:31:20,843
there stood the invincible armies...

780
01:31:21,304 --> 01:31:23,925
of the barbarian Hannibal.

781
01:31:24,640 --> 01:31:27,807
Ferocious mercenaries
and warriors...

782
01:31:27,894 --> 01:31:30,266
from all brute nations...

783
01:31:30,354 --> 01:31:34,648
bent on merciless destruction...

784
01:31:35,526 --> 01:31:36,855
conquest.

785
01:31:37,820 --> 01:31:41,865
<i>Your emperor is pleased to give you...</i>

786
01:31:41,949 --> 01:31:45,034
the barbarian horde!

787
01:31:53,378 --> 01:31:55,335
Anyone here been in the army?

788
01:31:55,421 --> 01:31:58,375
Yes. I served with you
at Vindobona.

789
01:31:59,300 --> 01:32:00,842
You can help me.

790
01:32:02,220 --> 01:32:04,508
Whatever comes out of these gates...

791
01:32:05,556 --> 01:32:08,890
we've got a better chance of survival
if we work together.

792
01:32:09,394 --> 01:32:11,137
<i>Do you understand?</i>

793
01:32:13,231 --> 01:32:15,307
If we stay together, we survive.

794
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:18,519
The Emperor is pleased to bring you
the legionnaires...

795
01:32:18,611 --> 01:32:22,194
of Scipio Africanus!

796
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:34,708
To the death!

797
01:32:38,506 --> 01:32:41,079
Kill!

798
01:32:44,929 --> 01:32:46,554
Stay close.

799
01:32:52,520 --> 01:32:54,394
Come together!

800
01:32:55,732 --> 01:32:59,776
Stay close. Staggered columns!

801
01:33:12,623 --> 01:33:14,533
You don't have a chance.

802
01:33:26,387 --> 01:33:28,925
Lock your shields. Stay as one.

803
01:33:30,433 --> 01:33:31,975
Hold!

804
01:33:34,145 --> 01:33:37,062
Hold! As one!

805
01:33:39,984 --> 01:33:41,313
Well done.

806
01:33:53,164 --> 01:33:56,996
Hold. Down low!

807
01:34:02,840 --> 01:34:04,003
Yes!

808
01:34:16,145 --> 01:34:17,343
Hagen!

809
01:34:41,504 --> 01:34:45,039
This column to the chariot!
This column stay with me!

810
01:34:48,678 --> 01:34:50,053
Quickly!

811
01:34:50,722 --> 01:34:53,473
- Get out there.
- Hurry!

812
01:35:34,682 --> 01:35:35,880
Maximus!

813
01:35:48,071 --> 01:35:50,443
Single column!

814
01:36:35,785 --> 01:36:37,160
We win!

815
01:36:42,583 --> 01:36:45,121
My history's a little hazy, Cassius...

816
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:48,838
but shouldn't the barbarians
lose the battle of Carthage?

817
01:36:48,923 --> 01:36:50,666
Yes, sire.

818
01:36:52,635 --> 01:36:53,964
Forgive me, sire.

819
01:36:54,053 --> 01:36:56,758
No, I rather enjoy surprises.

820
01:36:57,515 --> 01:36:58,678
Who is he?

821
01:36:58,766 --> 01:37:01,767
They call him the Spaniard, sire.

822
01:37:04,272 --> 01:37:06,099
I think I'll meet him.

823
01:37:06,274 --> 01:37:07,649
Yes, sire.

824
01:37:09,819 --> 01:37:11,693
Hail to the barbarians!

825
01:37:26,669 --> 01:37:30,038
Forward! Arms at ready!

826
01:37:43,644 --> 01:37:45,304
Drop your weapons.

827
01:37:49,317 --> 01:37:52,234
Gladiator, the Emperor has asked for you.

828
01:37:52,904 --> 01:37:55,027
I am at the Emperor's service.

829
01:38:21,766 --> 01:38:23,924
Rise.

830
01:38:33,444 --> 01:38:35,520
Your fame is well deserved, Spaniard.

831
01:38:35,613 --> 01:38:38,282
I don't think there's ever been a gladiator
to match you.

832
01:38:38,366 --> 01:38:41,153
As for this young man,
he insists you are Hector reborn.

833
01:38:41,244 --> 01:38:42,786
Or was it Hercules?

834
01:38:44,205 --> 01:38:47,954
<i>Why doesn't the hero reveal himself
and tell us all your real name?</i>

835
01:38:50,086 --> 01:38:51,710
You do have a name.

836
01:38:52,463 --> 01:38:54,372
My name is Gladiator.

837
01:38:57,635 --> 01:39:00,802
How dare you show your back to me? Slave!

838
01:39:02,140 --> 01:39:05,473
You will remove your helmet
and tell me your name.

839
01:39:17,321 --> 01:39:19,812
My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius...

840
01:39:20,158 --> 01:39:22,115
commander of the armies of the north...

841
01:39:22,201 --> 01:39:24,657
general of the Felix Legions...

842
01:39:24,746 --> 01:39:27,996
loyal servant to the true emperor,
Marcus Aurelius...

843
01:39:29,333 --> 01:39:31,492
father to a murdered son...

844
01:39:32,003 --> 01:39:34,292
husband to a murdered wife...

845
01:39:34,672 --> 01:39:38,337
and I will have my vengeance,
in this life or the next.

846
01:39:45,349 --> 01:39:46,760
Arms!

847
01:39:59,864 --> 01:40:03,198
Live!

848
01:40:50,498 --> 01:40:53,203
Arms, at rest!

849
01:41:45,636 --> 01:41:50,133
Maximus!

850
01:42:38,189 --> 01:42:39,434
Father.

851
01:43:53,765 --> 01:43:55,722
Why is he still alive?

852
01:43:56,934 --> 01:43:58,429
I don't know.

853
01:43:58,936 --> 01:44:00,561
He shouldn't be alive.

854
01:44:01,355 --> 01:44:02,766
It vexes me.

855
01:44:04,525 --> 01:44:06,269
I'm terribly vexed.

856
01:44:17,455 --> 01:44:19,448
I did what I had to do.

857
01:44:20,208 --> 01:44:24,252
<i>If Father had had his way,
the empire would have been torn apart.</i>

858
01:44:24,337 --> 01:44:25,961
<i>You do see that.</i>

859
01:44:26,381 --> 01:44:27,543
Yes.

860
01:44:32,303 --> 01:44:35,589
What did you feel when you saw him?

861
01:44:37,642 --> 01:44:39,302
I felt nothing.

862
01:44:41,270 --> 01:44:43,808
He wounded you deeply, didn't he?

863
01:44:44,816 --> 01:44:47,057
No more than I wounded him.

864
01:44:51,614 --> 01:44:53,820
They lied to me in Germania.

865
01:44:55,493 --> 01:44:57,569
They told me he was dead.

866
01:44:59,580 --> 01:45:02,154
If they lie to me, they don't respect me.

867
01:45:02,291 --> 01:45:05,577
If they don't respect me,
how can they ever love me?

868
01:45:06,921 --> 01:45:09,293
Then you must let the legions know...

869
01:45:09,382 --> 01:45:12,502
their treachery will not go unpunished.

870
01:45:13,344 --> 01:45:14,969
Poor sister.

871
01:45:15,179 --> 01:45:17,635
I wouldn't want to be your enemy.

872
01:45:18,850 --> 01:45:20,593
What will you do?

873
01:45:33,531 --> 01:45:34,859
This way.

874
01:46:10,318 --> 01:46:13,734
Rich matrons pay well
to be pleasured by the bravest champions.

875
01:46:13,821 --> 01:46:16,312
I knew your brother would send assassins.

876
01:46:16,824 --> 01:46:19,446
I didn't realize he would send his best.

877
01:46:21,079 --> 01:46:23,155
Maximus, he doesn't know.

878
01:46:24,123 --> 01:46:27,326
My family was burnt and crucified
while they were still alive.

879
01:46:27,418 --> 01:46:29,956
- I knew nothing...
- Don't lie to me!

880
01:46:36,344 --> 01:46:38,004
I wept for them.

881
01:46:38,179 --> 01:46:42,011
As you wept for your father?

882
01:46:42,100 --> 01:46:45,682
I have been living in a prison of fear
since that day.

883
01:46:46,187 --> 01:46:50,019
To be unable to mourn your father
for fear of your brother.

884
01:46:50,942 --> 01:46:54,108
To live in terror
every moment of every day...

885
01:46:54,195 --> 01:46:56,982
because your son is heir to the throne.

886
01:46:58,866 --> 01:47:00,325
I have wept.

887
01:47:01,661 --> 01:47:04,496
My son was innocent.

888
01:47:05,331 --> 01:47:07,371
So is mine.

889
01:47:09,377 --> 01:47:12,461
Must my son die, too,
before you'll trust me?

890
01:47:13,923 --> 01:47:16,877
What does it matter if I trust you or not?

891
01:47:17,760 --> 01:47:20,797
The gods have spared you.
Don't you understand?

892
01:47:20,888 --> 01:47:24,340
Today I saw a slave become more powerful
than the emperor of Rome.

893
01:47:24,434 --> 01:47:26,225
The gods have spared me?

894
01:47:26,310 --> 01:47:29,762
I am at their mercy,
with the power only to amuse a mob.

895
01:47:29,856 --> 01:47:31,564
That is power.

896
01:47:31,858 --> 01:47:33,020
The mob is Rome.

897
01:47:33,109 --> 01:47:36,857
And while Commodus controls them,
he controls everything.

898
01:47:37,071 --> 01:47:38,613
Listen to me.

899
01:47:39,157 --> 01:47:42,074
My brother has enemies,
most of all in the Senate.

900
01:47:42,368 --> 01:47:44,610
But while the people follow him...

901
01:47:44,704 --> 01:47:47,705
no one would dare stand up to him
until you.

902
01:47:48,708 --> 01:47:51,115
They oppose him, yet they do nothing.

903
01:47:51,210 --> 01:47:54,829
There are some politicians
who have dedicated their lives to Rome.

904
01:47:54,922 --> 01:47:56,666
One man above all.

905
01:47:57,759 --> 01:48:00,843
If I can arrange it, will you meet him?

906
01:48:01,179 --> 01:48:03,088
Do you not understand?

907
01:48:03,347 --> 01:48:07,594
I may die in this cell tonight,
or in the arena tomorrow. I am a slave!

908
01:48:07,685 --> 01:48:10,307
What possible difference can I make?

909
01:48:10,605 --> 01:48:12,847
This man wants what you want.

910
01:48:12,940 --> 01:48:15,182
Then have him kill Commodus!

911
01:48:17,737 --> 01:48:19,564
I knew a man once...

912
01:48:20,490 --> 01:48:21,818
a noble man.

913
01:48:22,742 --> 01:48:25,659
A man of principle who loved my father...

914
01:48:26,662 --> 01:48:28,702
and my father loved him.

915
01:48:30,666 --> 01:48:32,825
This man served Rome well.

916
01:48:37,173 --> 01:48:38,881
That man is gone.

917
01:48:40,051 --> 01:48:42,174
Your brother did his work well.

918
01:48:42,261 --> 01:48:43,921
Let me help you.

919
01:48:49,852 --> 01:48:52,937
Yes, you can help me.

920
01:48:56,275 --> 01:48:59,976
Forget you ever knew me,
never come here again.

921
01:49:03,658 --> 01:49:06,410
Guard! The lady is finished with me.

922
01:49:34,856 --> 01:49:36,516
What's your name?

923
01:49:39,527 --> 01:49:40,938
Julian Crassus.

924
01:49:46,617 --> 01:49:47,815
Name?

925
01:49:49,162 --> 01:49:50,656
Marcus, sire.

926
01:49:51,581 --> 01:49:53,408
My father's name.

927
01:50:00,798 --> 01:50:05,507
They must have known of Maximus' escape
when they found the bodies of the four men.

928
01:50:06,345 --> 01:50:08,919
They thought it was a barbarian raid.

929
01:50:09,974 --> 01:50:13,141
These are good men, sire.
Loyal to the Emperor.

930
01:50:20,401 --> 01:50:22,441
Load your arrows!

931
01:50:29,369 --> 01:50:31,278
Prepare to fire!

932
01:50:52,266 --> 01:50:55,552
Then perhaps it was you
who knew...

933
01:50:56,396 --> 01:50:57,854
and never told me.

934
01:50:58,356 --> 01:51:00,598
- I didn't know.
- You didn't know?

935
01:51:02,110 --> 01:51:04,945
But a general
is always in control.

936
01:51:06,322 --> 01:51:09,987
Always in command, isn't he?

937
01:51:11,536 --> 01:51:12,994
Yes, Caesar.

938
01:51:26,926 --> 01:51:29,595
Then give the command. Say it.

939
01:51:46,529 --> 01:51:47,692
Fire.

940
01:52:22,940 --> 01:52:24,221
Maximus.

941
01:52:24,984 --> 01:52:28,104
You commanded legions?
You had many victories?

942
01:52:28,988 --> 01:52:31,230
- Yes.
- In Germania?

943
01:52:33,117 --> 01:52:34,861
In many countries.

944
01:52:36,454 --> 01:52:37,782
General.

945
01:53:26,879 --> 01:53:28,753
You have a great name.

946
01:53:30,299 --> 01:53:33,300
He must kill your name before he kills you.

947
01:53:42,270 --> 01:53:43,598
Yes, at the far end.

948
01:53:43,688 --> 01:53:46,013
Senator Gaius.
Hello.

949
01:53:46,107 --> 01:53:48,064
Senator Gracchus.

950
01:53:49,694 --> 01:53:53,063
Don't often see you enjoying the pleasures
of the vulgar crowd.

951
01:53:53,156 --> 01:53:56,322
I don't pretend to be a man of the people,
Senator...

952
01:53:56,409 --> 01:53:58,947
but I do try to be a man for the people.

953
01:54:15,136 --> 01:54:19,632
Caesar!

954
01:54:24,896 --> 01:54:26,604
People of Rome!

955
01:54:28,858 --> 01:54:31,266
On the fourth day of Antioch...

956
01:54:31,903 --> 01:54:36,280
we can celebrate the 64th day of the games.

957
01:54:36,908 --> 01:54:41,155
<i>And in his majestic charity...</i>

958
01:54:41,913 --> 01:54:46,124
<i>the Emperor has deigned this day
to favor the people of Rome...</i>

959
01:54:46,709 --> 01:54:50,125
<i>with an historical final match.</i>

960
01:54:50,922 --> 01:54:55,500
Returning to the Colosseum today,
after five years in retirement...

961
01:54:56,928 --> 01:55:00,379
Caesar is pleased to bring you...

962
01:55:00,473 --> 01:55:04,257
the only undefeated champion...

963
01:55:04,352 --> 01:55:06,344
in Roman history:

964
01:55:06,437 --> 01:55:11,313
The legendary Tigris of Gaul!

965
01:55:32,964 --> 01:55:36,130
He knows too well
how to manipulate the mob.

966
01:55:36,217 --> 01:55:38,886
Marcus Aurelius had a dream
that was Rome, Proximo.

967
01:55:38,970 --> 01:55:41,721
This is not it.

968
01:55:41,806 --> 01:55:44,641
Marcus Aurelius is dead, Maximus.

969
01:55:45,476 --> 01:55:48,098
We mortals are but shadows and dust.

970
01:55:48,771 --> 01:55:50,847
<i>Shadows and dust, Maximus!</i>

971
01:55:50,940 --> 01:55:54,807
Representing the training lyceum
of Antonius Proximo...

972
01:55:54,902 --> 01:55:58,567
Caesar is proud to give you...

973
01:55:58,656 --> 01:56:02,488
Aelius Maximus!

974
01:56:15,298 --> 01:56:17,670
They embrace him
like he's one of their own.

975
01:56:17,759 --> 01:56:21,673
The mob is fickle, brother.
He'll be forgotten in a month.

976
01:56:24,432 --> 01:56:27,267
No, much sooner than that.

977
01:56:29,187 --> 01:56:30,978
It's been arranged.

978
01:56:49,499 --> 01:56:52,453
We who are about to die salute you.

979
01:56:55,755 --> 01:56:57,712
We're with you, Maximus!

980
01:57:40,174 --> 01:57:41,716
Fight on, finish it!

981
01:58:10,204 --> 01:58:11,864
Pull, pull!

982
01:58:44,238 --> 01:58:45,816
Loose! Loose!

983
01:59:13,893 --> 01:59:15,969
Gut him!
Kill!

984
01:59:17,438 --> 01:59:21,021
Kill!

985
02:00:21,377 --> 02:00:23,584
Maximus the Merciful!

986
02:00:32,764 --> 02:00:37,556
Maximus!

987
02:00:44,859 --> 02:00:47,694
Forward, arms at ready!

988
02:01:18,351 --> 02:01:20,842
What am I going to do
with you?

989
02:01:21,854 --> 02:01:25,354
You simply won't die.

990
02:01:30,154 --> 02:01:32,480
Are we so different, you and I?

991
02:01:33,616 --> 02:01:36,534
You take life when you have to, as I do.

992
02:01:37,912 --> 02:01:41,957
I have only one more life to take.
Then it is done.

993
02:01:42,125 --> 02:01:43,868
Then take it now.

994
02:01:56,889 --> 02:01:58,929
<i>They tell me your son...</i>

995
02:01:59,726 --> 02:02:03,640
<i>squealed like a girl
when they nailed him to the cross.</i>

996
02:02:05,815 --> 02:02:07,475
And your wife...

997
02:02:08,693 --> 02:02:10,602
moaned like a whore...

998
02:02:11,738 --> 02:02:16,281
when they ravaged her again and again...

999
02:02:17,660 --> 02:02:19,035
and again.

1000
02:02:24,292 --> 02:02:28,040
The time for honoring yourself
will soon be at an end...

1001
02:02:32,675 --> 02:02:34,004
Highness.

1002
02:02:51,319 --> 02:02:53,146
Maximus!

1003
02:03:01,537 --> 02:03:02,913
General!

1004
02:03:09,420 --> 02:03:11,496
General!
Cicero!

1005
02:03:19,222 --> 02:03:21,510
- Where are you camped?
- Ostia.

1006
02:03:27,980 --> 02:03:30,934
We love you, Maximus!
Praise the victor!

1007
02:03:31,025 --> 02:03:33,563
Tell the men their general lives. Find me.

1008
02:03:33,653 --> 02:03:35,978
Move along!
Find me!

1009
02:04:01,347 --> 02:04:03,304
Can they hear you?

1010
02:04:06,894 --> 02:04:10,394
- Who?
- Your family, in the afterlife.

1011
02:04:12,859 --> 02:04:15,480
Yes.
What do you say to them?

1012
02:04:19,115 --> 02:04:20,574
To my boy...

1013
02:04:22,410 --> 02:04:24,948
I tell him I will see him again soon...

1014
02:04:25,038 --> 02:04:28,656
and to keep his heels down
when he's riding his horse.

1015
02:04:29,917 --> 02:04:31,412
To my wife...

1016
02:04:33,921 --> 02:04:36,044
that is not your business.

1017
02:04:43,806 --> 02:04:46,677
And now they love Maximus for his mercy.

1018
02:04:48,102 --> 02:04:51,637
So I can't just kill him,
or it makes me even more unmerciful.

1019
02:04:52,982 --> 02:04:57,229
The whole thing
is like some great nightmare.

1020
02:04:58,362 --> 02:05:00,106
He is defying you.

1021
02:05:00,281 --> 02:05:03,697
His every victory is an act of defiance.

1022
02:05:03,826 --> 02:05:07,444
The mob sees this, and so do the Senate.

1023
02:05:08,164 --> 02:05:11,081
Every day he lives, they grow bolder.

1024
02:05:12,543 --> 02:05:14,335
- Kill him.
- No.

1025
02:05:16,214 --> 02:05:18,621
I will not make a martyr of him.

1026
02:05:25,765 --> 02:05:28,303
When I went to the Senate today...

1027
02:05:28,393 --> 02:05:33,268
I purposefully told them about using
the grain reserves to pay for the games.

1028
02:05:34,690 --> 02:05:36,849
And did you note what happened?

1029
02:05:36,943 --> 02:05:40,146
- Nothing.
- Exactly. Nothing.

1030
02:05:41,155 --> 02:05:43,527
Not a single word of protest.

1031
02:05:43,616 --> 02:05:47,199
Even the insolent Senator Gracchus
was silent as a mouse.

1032
02:05:47,286 --> 02:05:48,449
Why?

1033
02:05:50,206 --> 02:05:53,871
I have been told of a certain sea snake...

1034
02:05:53,960 --> 02:05:58,289
which has a very unusual method
of attracting its prey.

1035
02:05:58,464 --> 02:06:02,213
It will lie at the bottom of the ocean
as if wounded.

1036
02:06:02,635 --> 02:06:05,470
Then its enemies will approach...

1037
02:06:05,555 --> 02:06:08,639
and yet it will lie quite still.

1038
02:06:08,975 --> 02:06:12,807
And then its enemies
will take little bites of it...

1039
02:06:12,895 --> 02:06:16,145
and yet it remains still.

1040
02:06:19,402 --> 02:06:20,564
So...

1041
02:06:21,904 --> 02:06:23,648
we will lie still...

1042
02:06:24,490 --> 02:06:27,824
and let our enemies come to us and nibble.

1043
02:06:28,870 --> 02:06:31,111
<i>Have every senator followed.</i>

1044
02:06:48,806 --> 02:06:52,590
Cicero, my old friend. I thought perhaps
I'd seen you for the last time.

1045
02:06:52,685 --> 02:06:55,093
I thought you were dead.
Close.

1046
02:06:55,188 --> 02:06:58,307
- How long have the men been in Ostia?
- All winter.

1047
02:06:58,608 --> 02:07:01,858
- And how do they look?
- Fat and bored.

1048
02:07:02,570 --> 02:07:05,737
Who's in command?
Some fool from Rome.

1049
02:07:07,033 --> 02:07:09,275
How soon do you think
they could be ready to fight?

1050
02:07:09,369 --> 02:07:11,160
For you, tomorrow.

1051
02:07:12,413 --> 02:07:14,904
I need you to do something for me.

1052
02:07:19,545 --> 02:07:20,956
Come, see, witness.

1053
02:07:21,047 --> 02:07:24,083
<i>If you haven't been in the arena,
you can see the show here.</i>

1054
02:07:24,175 --> 02:07:27,793
Giant Maximus
is defeating our emperor, Commodus.

1055
02:07:27,887 --> 02:07:30,460
What are we to do?
He's just defying everyone...

1056
02:07:30,556 --> 02:07:32,596
by doing this to him, they do...

1057
02:07:33,518 --> 02:07:34,846
My goodness!

1058
02:07:36,646 --> 02:07:40,229
He got him, he's defeated.
Give way!

1059
02:07:46,364 --> 02:07:49,033
My lady? I served your father at Vindobona.

1060
02:07:49,117 --> 02:07:50,527
Back.
My lady.

1061
02:07:50,618 --> 02:07:52,776
<i>I served your father at Vindobona.</i>

1062
02:07:53,121 --> 02:07:54,200
Back!

1063
02:07:54,288 --> 02:07:57,492
And I served General Maximus.
I serve him still.

1064
02:07:59,001 --> 02:08:00,164
Stop.

1065
02:08:03,214 --> 02:08:04,625
<i>Stand back.</i>

1066
02:08:05,925 --> 02:08:08,961
The General sends word,
he will meet your politician.

1067
02:08:10,680 --> 02:08:13,930
- For your loyalty, soldier.
- Thank you, my lady.

1068
02:08:23,735 --> 02:08:25,193
Leave us.

1069
02:08:30,783 --> 02:08:32,491
Senator Gracchus.

1070
02:08:46,299 --> 02:08:47,579
General.

1071
02:08:48,676 --> 02:08:51,381
I hope my coming here today
is evidence enough...

1072
02:08:51,471 --> 02:08:54,590
that you can trust me.

1073
02:08:58,936 --> 02:09:01,392
- The Senate is with you?
- The Senate?

1074
02:09:02,899 --> 02:09:05,603
Yes. I can speak for them.

1075
02:09:06,194 --> 02:09:09,563
You can buy my freedom
and smuggle me out of Rome?

1076
02:09:09,906 --> 02:09:11,530
To what end?

1077
02:09:12,825 --> 02:09:15,151
Get me outside the city walls.

1078
02:09:15,745 --> 02:09:19,659
Have fresh horses ready to take me to Ostia.
My army is encamped there.

1079
02:09:19,749 --> 02:09:23,082
By nightfall of the second day,
I'll return at the head of 5,000 men.

1080
02:09:23,169 --> 02:09:25,375
But the legions
all have new commanders...

1081
02:09:25,463 --> 02:09:26,874
loyal to Commodus.

1082
02:09:26,964 --> 02:09:30,215
Let my men see me alive,
and you shall see where their loyalties lie.

1083
02:09:30,301 --> 02:09:31,961
This is madness.

1084
02:09:32,553 --> 02:09:35,887
<i>No Roman army has entered the capital
in 100 years.</i>

1085
02:09:35,973 --> 02:09:38,215
I will not trade one dictatorship for another!

1086
02:09:38,309 --> 02:09:41,844
The time for half measures and talk is over,
Senator.

1087
02:09:42,355 --> 02:09:45,475
And after your glorious coup, what then?

1088
02:09:46,692 --> 02:09:50,358
You'll take your 5,000 warriors and leave?

1089
02:09:50,446 --> 02:09:51,940
I will leave.

1090
02:09:52,448 --> 02:09:56,280
The soldiers will stay for your protection
under the command of the Senate.

1091
02:09:56,369 --> 02:09:57,531
So...

1092
02:09:57,870 --> 02:10:02,117
once all of Rome is yours,
you'll just give it back to the people?

1093
02:10:03,668 --> 02:10:05,127
Tell me why.

1094
02:10:10,633 --> 02:10:13,753
Because that was the last wish
of a dying man.

1095
02:10:16,806 --> 02:10:18,680
I will kill Commodus.

1096
02:10:20,643 --> 02:10:23,679
The fate of Rome I leave to you.

1097
02:10:25,565 --> 02:10:27,807
Marcus Aurelius trusted you.

1098
02:10:29,569 --> 02:10:31,608
His daughter trusts you.

1099
02:10:35,616 --> 02:10:37,324
I will trust you.

1100
02:10:37,702 --> 02:10:39,741
But we have little time.

1101
02:10:40,288 --> 02:10:42,031
Give me two days...

1102
02:10:42,832 --> 02:10:45,074
and I will buy your freedom.

1103
02:10:45,793 --> 02:10:47,371
And you...

1104
02:10:48,671 --> 02:10:50,296
You stay alive...

1105
02:10:51,799 --> 02:10:53,459
or I'll be dead.

1106
02:10:55,303 --> 02:10:56,880
<i>Now we must go.</i>

1107
02:11:23,956 --> 02:11:27,539
He'll be waiting for you.
Stand at the foot of the colossus.

1108
02:11:27,627 --> 02:11:29,204
He'll find you.

1109
02:12:13,339 --> 02:12:14,833
It won't work.

1110
02:12:15,883 --> 02:12:18,042
The Emperor knows too much.

1111
02:12:19,053 --> 02:12:20,002
And as for me...

1112
02:12:22,014 --> 02:12:24,091
it's becoming dangerous.

1113
02:12:25,351 --> 02:12:27,593
You'll be paid on my return.

1114
02:12:29,689 --> 02:12:31,480
I give you my word.

1115
02:12:31,649 --> 02:12:34,733
Your word? What if you don't return?

1116
02:12:36,070 --> 02:12:39,071
Do you remember what it was
to have trust, Proximo?

1117
02:12:39,157 --> 02:12:40,355
Trust?

1118
02:12:44,620 --> 02:12:46,364
Who am I to trust?

1119
02:12:46,956 --> 02:12:50,491
I will kill Commodus.
Why would I want that?

1120
02:12:50,918 --> 02:12:52,626
He makes me rich.

1121
02:12:57,759 --> 02:13:00,594
I know that you are a man of your word,
General.

1122
02:13:02,346 --> 02:13:04,968
I know that you would die
for honor.

1123
02:13:06,267 --> 02:13:08,224
You would die for Rome.

1124
02:13:09,270 --> 02:13:12,437
You would die for the memory
of your ancestors.

1125
02:13:12,523 --> 02:13:14,849
But I, on the other hand...

1126
02:13:17,528 --> 02:13:19,320
I'm an entertainer.

1127
02:13:22,825 --> 02:13:24,023
Guard!

1128
02:13:28,873 --> 02:13:31,446
He killed the man who set you free.

1129
02:13:40,635 --> 02:13:42,462
Praetorians, master.

1130
02:13:48,643 --> 02:13:49,888
Halt!

1131
02:14:54,959 --> 02:14:56,952
Where have you been?

1132
02:14:57,211 --> 02:14:58,955
I sent for you.

1133
02:15:00,381 --> 02:15:02,041
Please, brother.

1134
02:15:07,805 --> 02:15:09,679
What's troubling you?

1135
02:15:12,101 --> 02:15:14,473
Does Gracchus have a new lover?

1136
02:15:16,272 --> 02:15:17,897
I don't know.

1137
02:15:19,776 --> 02:15:21,852
I thought you'd seen him.

1138
02:15:22,737 --> 02:15:25,607
He infects everyone
like a putrid fever.

1139
02:15:27,075 --> 02:15:30,278
For the health of Rome,
the Senate must be bled.

1140
02:15:30,703 --> 02:15:32,696
<i>And he will bleed, too.</i>

1141
02:15:33,623 --> 02:15:34,998
Very soon.

1142
02:15:36,501 --> 02:15:38,161
<i>But not tonight.</i>

1143
02:15:53,184 --> 02:15:56,220
Do you remember
what our father said once?

1144
02:15:57,480 --> 02:15:59,140
"It's a dream...

1145
02:16:01,025 --> 02:16:02,899
"a frightful dream...

1146
02:16:05,446 --> 02:16:06,822
"life is."

1147
02:16:09,492 --> 02:16:11,568
Do you think that's true?

1148
02:16:12,328 --> 02:16:13,822
I don't know.

1149
02:16:17,458 --> 02:16:18,952
I think it is.

1150
02:16:21,713 --> 02:16:24,417
And I have only you to share it with.

1151
02:17:02,045 --> 02:17:03,622
Open your mouth.

1152
02:17:40,958 --> 02:17:42,785
You know I love you.

1153
02:17:44,837 --> 02:17:46,415
And I love you.

1154
02:18:23,084 --> 02:18:24,708
Out. Get out!

1155
02:18:25,837 --> 02:18:27,035
<i>Move!</i>

1156
02:18:31,801 --> 02:18:33,877
Congratulations, General.

1157
02:18:33,970 --> 02:18:36,805
You've got very persuasive friends.

1158
02:18:42,687 --> 02:18:45,178
My brother has had Gracchus arrested.

1159
02:18:45,273 --> 02:18:48,606
We daren't wait any longer.
We must leave tonight.

1160
02:18:48,818 --> 02:18:52,436
Proximo will come at midnight
and take you to the gate.

1161
02:18:53,114 --> 02:18:56,779
Your servant, Cicero, will be waiting there
with horses.

1162
02:18:58,786 --> 02:19:01,491
You have done all this?
Yes.

1163
02:19:02,290 --> 02:19:03,998
You risk too much.

1164
02:19:04,959 --> 02:19:06,952
I have much to pay for.

1165
02:19:09,380 --> 02:19:11,587
You have nothing to pay for.

1166
02:19:11,674 --> 02:19:14,758
You love your son. You're strong for him.

1167
02:19:17,930 --> 02:19:20,338
I am tired of being strong.

1168
02:19:22,393 --> 02:19:26,605
My brother hates all the world,
and you most of all.

1169
02:19:26,981 --> 02:19:30,101
Because your father chose me.
No.

1170
02:19:31,402 --> 02:19:33,691
Because my father loved you.

1171
02:19:37,575 --> 02:19:39,983
And because I loved you.

1172
02:19:42,580 --> 02:19:44,240
A long time ago.

1173
02:19:49,003 --> 02:19:51,126
Was I very different then?

1174
02:19:57,720 --> 02:19:59,512
You laughed more.

1175
02:20:03,518 --> 02:20:05,925
I have felt alone all my life...

1176
02:20:07,230 --> 02:20:08,890
except with you.

1177
02:20:11,984 --> 02:20:13,479
I must go.

1178
02:20:14,028 --> 02:20:15,143
Yes.

1179
02:20:43,641 --> 02:20:44,839
There.

1180
02:20:56,404 --> 02:20:57,946
And I got you.

1181
02:21:00,950 --> 02:21:03,156
Isn't it late
to be playing legionnaire?

1182
02:21:03,244 --> 02:21:05,118
I'm not a legionnaire.

1183
02:21:05,371 --> 02:21:07,993
- Not a legionnaire?
- I'm a gladiator.

1184
02:21:09,250 --> 02:21:10,709
A gladiator?

1185
02:21:11,419 --> 02:21:13,992
Gladiators only fight in the games.

1186
02:21:14,172 --> 02:21:17,588
Wouldn't you rather be
a great Roman warrior like Julius Caesar?

1187
02:21:17,675 --> 02:21:20,249
I'm Maximus, the savior of Rome!

1188
02:21:23,097 --> 02:21:24,924
The savior of Rome?

1189
02:21:32,940 --> 02:21:34,684
And who said that?

1190
02:21:43,493 --> 02:21:45,070
Where's Lucius?

1191
02:21:46,329 --> 02:21:48,701
He's with the Emperor, my lady.

1192
02:21:51,584 --> 02:21:53,327
She couldn't.
She did.

1193
02:21:53,419 --> 02:21:55,578
She took it from a basket...

1194
02:21:56,881 --> 02:22:00,665
and pressed it to her breast,
right here above her heart.

1195
02:22:02,470 --> 02:22:05,720
It bit her in the breast?
Yes.

1196
02:22:06,432 --> 02:22:10,382
You see, Lucius, sometimes royal ladies...

1197
02:22:10,770 --> 02:22:14,850
behave very strangely
and do very odd things in the name of love.

1198
02:22:14,941 --> 02:22:17,646
I think it's silly.
So do I.

1199
02:22:21,406 --> 02:22:23,445
Sister, join us.

1200
02:22:24,075 --> 02:22:25,818
I've been reading
to dear Lucius.

1201
02:22:25,910 --> 02:22:27,950
I've been reading, too.
Yes.

1202
02:22:28,037 --> 02:22:32,284
He's a very clever little boy.
He'll make a grand emperor one day.

1203
02:22:33,918 --> 02:22:37,702
We've been reading about the great
Mark Antony and his adventures in Egypt.

1204
02:22:37,797 --> 02:22:40,335
And the queen killed herself with a snake.

1205
02:22:40,425 --> 02:22:44,043
And just wait until you hear
what happened to our ancestors.

1206
02:22:44,137 --> 02:22:48,633
If you're very good, tomorrow night
I'll tell you the story of Emperor Claudius.

1207
02:22:49,892 --> 02:22:51,636
He was betrayed...

1208
02:22:52,562 --> 02:22:54,685
by those closest to him.

1209
02:22:56,566 --> 02:22:58,309
By his own blood.

1210
02:22:59,652 --> 02:23:02,143
<i>They whispered in dark corners...</i>

1211
02:23:02,238 --> 02:23:04,527
<i>and went out late at night...</i>

1212
02:23:04,782 --> 02:23:08,116
and conspired, and conspired.

1213
02:23:10,663 --> 02:23:14,577
But the Emperor Claudius knew
that they were up to something.

1214
02:23:14,667 --> 02:23:17,241
<i>He knew they were busy little bees.</i>

1215
02:23:19,172 --> 02:23:22,256
And one night he sat down
with one of them...

1216
02:23:23,009 --> 02:23:25,001
and he looked at her...

1217
02:23:25,928 --> 02:23:27,471
and he said:

1218
02:23:28,556 --> 02:23:31,094
"Tell me what you've been doing...

1219
02:23:31,768 --> 02:23:33,511
"busy little bee.

1220
02:23:35,813 --> 02:23:38,933
"Or I shall strike down those dearest to you.

1221
02:23:40,068 --> 02:23:43,152
<i>"You shall watch as I bathe in their blood."</i>

1222
02:23:46,741 --> 02:23:49,148
And the Emperor was heartbroken.

1223
02:23:51,287 --> 02:23:56,163
The little bee had wounded him more deeply
than anyone else could ever have done.

1224
02:23:58,378 --> 02:24:01,248
<i>What do you think happened then, Lucius?</i>

1225
02:24:01,881 --> 02:24:03,708
I don't know, Uncle.

1226
02:24:10,223 --> 02:24:12,796
The little bee told him everything.

1227
02:25:10,867 --> 02:25:13,951
Open,
in the name of the Emperor!

1228
02:25:14,537 --> 02:25:15,817
<i>Proximo!</i>

1229
02:25:16,706 --> 02:25:19,909
<i>Open the gates,
in the name of the Emperor!</i>

1230
02:25:24,213 --> 02:25:25,672
Open the gates!

1231
02:25:31,512 --> 02:25:33,801
<i>Open the gates, Proximo.</i>

1232
02:25:34,265 --> 02:25:36,507
<i>Do you want to die, old man?</i>

1233
02:25:37,727 --> 02:25:38,842
Here.

1234
02:25:39,479 --> 02:25:41,555
Everything is prepared.

1235
02:25:41,647 --> 02:25:44,138
It seems you have won your freedom.

1236
02:25:44,233 --> 02:25:47,816
Proximo, are you in danger
of becoming a good man?

1237
02:25:52,909 --> 02:25:56,741
- Juba.
- All enemies of the emperor die!

1238
02:25:57,288 --> 02:25:59,446
<i>Open the gates!</i>

1239
02:26:04,962 --> 02:26:06,920
Pull!

1240
02:26:09,092 --> 02:26:11,927
Move!
Form a column on the left!

1241
02:26:15,723 --> 02:26:18,760
I only need moments,
so do not be careless with your lives.

1242
02:26:18,851 --> 02:26:21,603
If you don't want any part of this,
go back to your cells.

1243
02:26:21,687 --> 02:26:23,846
We'll wait here for you, Maximus.

1244
02:26:23,940 --> 02:26:26,810
Strength and honor.
Go.

1245
02:26:27,693 --> 02:26:29,520
Strength and honor.

1246
02:26:32,156 --> 02:26:34,991
Aim. Arch your bows!

1247
02:27:42,101 --> 02:27:43,382
Shadows and dust.

1248
02:28:25,311 --> 02:28:26,426
Maximus!

1249
02:28:32,026 --> 02:28:33,437
I'm sorry.

1250
02:28:59,846 --> 02:29:01,221
It's done.

1251
02:29:08,187 --> 02:29:10,263
And what of my nephew?

1252
02:29:11,149 --> 02:29:13,141
And what of his mother?

1253
02:29:15,194 --> 02:29:17,768
Should they share her lover's fate?

1254
02:29:19,490 --> 02:29:21,530
Or should I be merciful?

1255
02:29:24,245 --> 02:29:26,154
Commodus the Merciful.

1256
02:29:32,628 --> 02:29:34,917
Lucius will stay with me now.

1257
02:29:36,049 --> 02:29:37,875
And if his mother...

1258
02:29:39,302 --> 02:29:41,378
so much as looks at me...

1259
02:29:42,555 --> 02:29:45,046
in a manner that displeases me...

1260
02:29:47,018 --> 02:29:48,477
he will die.

1261
02:29:51,898 --> 02:29:55,183
If she decides to be noble...

1262
02:29:56,944 --> 02:29:59,020
and takes her own life...

1263
02:30:00,615 --> 02:30:02,074
he will die.

1264
02:30:05,703 --> 02:30:07,530
And as for you...

1265
02:30:10,249 --> 02:30:12,041
you will love me...

1266
02:30:12,752 --> 02:30:14,579
as I have loved you.

1267
02:30:16,172 --> 02:30:19,837
You will provide me
with an heir of pure blood...

1268
02:30:20,843 --> 02:30:22,635
so that Commodus...

1269
02:30:23,221 --> 02:30:26,175
and his progeny will rule for 1,000 years.

1270
02:30:30,812 --> 02:30:32,555
Am I not merciful?

1271
02:30:54,419 --> 02:30:57,040
Am I not merciful!

1272
02:31:09,267 --> 02:31:12,470
Maximus!

1273
02:31:40,715 --> 02:31:43,467
I'm a soldier. I obey.

1274
02:31:46,179 --> 02:31:50,473
Nothing happens to anyone
that he is not fitted by nature to bear.

1275
02:32:23,424 --> 02:32:24,705
Maximus!

1276
02:32:31,099 --> 02:32:33,008
They call for you.

1277
02:32:34,894 --> 02:32:38,144
The general
who became a slave.

1278
02:32:39,399 --> 02:32:41,806
The slave who became a gladiator.

1279
02:32:43,152 --> 02:32:45,987
The gladiator who defied an emperor.

1280
02:32:47,907 --> 02:32:49,615
A striking story.

1281
02:32:50,785 --> 02:32:54,070
Now the people want to know
how the story ends.

1282
02:32:56,374 --> 02:32:58,616
Only a famous death will do.

1283
02:33:00,545 --> 02:33:03,083
And what could be more glorious...

1284
02:33:03,464 --> 02:33:07,213
than to challenge the Emperor himself
in the great arena?

1285
02:33:09,554 --> 02:33:12,590
You would fight me?
Why not?

1286
02:33:13,808 --> 02:33:15,847
Do you think I'm afraid?

1287
02:33:16,644 --> 02:33:19,645
I think you have been afraid all your life.

1288
02:33:19,772 --> 02:33:23,473
Unlike Maximus the Invincible,
who knows no fear?

1289
02:33:29,240 --> 02:33:32,276
I knew a man who once said,
"Death smiles at us all.

1290
02:33:33,536 --> 02:33:35,992
"All a man can do is smile back."

1291
02:33:37,790 --> 02:33:39,201
I wonder...

1292
02:33:39,834 --> 02:33:42,621
did your friend smile at his own death?

1293
02:33:43,004 --> 02:33:44,546
You must know.

1294
02:33:47,425 --> 02:33:49,216
He was your father.

1295
02:33:53,097 --> 02:33:55,422
You loved my father, I know...

1296
02:33:56,934 --> 02:33:58,429
but so did I.

1297
02:34:00,063 --> 02:34:02,636
That makes us brothers, doesn't it?

1298
02:34:05,276 --> 02:34:07,399
Smile for me now, brother.

1299
02:34:12,909 --> 02:34:15,696
Strap on his armor. Conceal the wound.

1300
02:35:10,133 --> 02:35:12,090
Ring formation!

1301
02:37:03,913 --> 02:37:05,491
Quintus, sword.

1302
02:37:06,999 --> 02:37:08,791
Give me your sword.

1303
02:37:12,213 --> 02:37:14,206
Sword! Give me a sword!

1304
02:37:15,717 --> 02:37:17,543
Sheathe your swords.

1305
02:39:34,731 --> 02:39:36,141
Maximus.

1306
02:39:43,281 --> 02:39:44,609
Quintus.

1307
02:39:46,284 --> 02:39:47,743
Free my men.

1308
02:39:49,203 --> 02:39:51,908
Senator Gracchus
is to be reinstated.

1309
02:39:53,124 --> 02:39:55,200
There was a dream that was Rome.

1310
02:39:55,877 --> 02:39:57,750
<i>It shall be realized.</i>

1311
02:39:58,504 --> 02:40:01,078
These are the wishes of Marcus Aurelius.

1312
02:40:01,966 --> 02:40:04,042
Free the prisoners. Go!

1313
02:40:28,743 --> 02:40:30,023
Maximus.

1314
02:40:31,954 --> 02:40:33,532
Lucius is safe.

1315
02:40:49,847 --> 02:40:51,258
Go to them.

1316
02:41:41,065 --> 02:41:42,524
You're home.

1317
02:42:09,135 --> 02:42:11,708
Is Rome worth one good man's life?

1318
02:42:15,558 --> 02:42:17,385
We believed it once.

1319
02:42:20,563 --> 02:42:22,639
Make us believe it again.

1320
02:42:26,194 --> 02:42:28,270
He was a soldier of Rome.

1321
02:42:32,116 --> 02:42:33,527
Honor him.

1322
02:42:33,993 --> 02:42:36,152
Who will help me carry him?

1323
02:43:20,915 --> 02:43:22,575
Now we are free.

1324
02:43:28,965 --> 02:43:30,839
I will see you again.

1325
02:43:33,720 --> 02:43:35,178
But not yet.

1326
02:43:36,180 --> 02:43:37,509
Not yet.
