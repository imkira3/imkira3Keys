2
00:03:58,155 --> 00:03:59,905
Think of it, Thing.

3
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,534
For 25 years,

4
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:06,579
we've attempted to contact Fester
in the great beyond,

5
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:09,416
and for 25 years,

6
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:10,959
nothing.

7
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:15,882
I'm beginning to think
my brother truly is lost.

8
00:04:26,226 --> 00:04:29,145
Don't be a baby. I know what I'm doing.

9
00:04:32,274 --> 00:04:33,482
Help me.

10
00:04:46,289 --> 00:04:47,748
Look at her.

11
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:50,791
I would die for her.

12
00:04:51,794 --> 00:04:53,587
I would kill for her.

13
00:04:55,089 --> 00:04:56,716
Either way, what bliss.

14
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:06,601
- Unhappy, darling?
- Oh, yes.

15
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,395
Yes, completely.

16
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:18,738
Gomez,

17
00:05:20,283 --> 00:05:21,575
the sun.

18
00:05:24,245 --> 00:05:27,747
Oh, Tish, that's French.

19
00:05:28,123 --> 00:05:29,166
Oui.

20
00:05:31,461 --> 00:05:32,504
Cara mia.

21
00:05:36,175 --> 00:05:38,884
En garde, monsieur Soleil.

22
00:05:41,514 --> 00:05:42,764
Gomez?

23
00:05:43,141 --> 00:05:44,181
Querida.

24
00:05:44,516 --> 00:05:47,561
Last night you were unhinged.

25
00:05:48,563 --> 00:05:51,398
You were like some
desperate howling demon.

26
00:05:51,941 --> 00:05:53,651
You frightened me.

27
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,237
Do it again.

28
00:06:04,538 --> 00:06:06,205
Thank you, Lurch.

29
00:06:43,746 --> 00:06:45,455
Damn you, Addams!

30
00:06:45,873 --> 00:06:47,749
Sorry about the window, Judge.

31
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:50,628
Keep the ball. I have a whole bucketful.

32
00:06:54,757 --> 00:06:56,425
You moron!

33
00:07:00,597 --> 00:07:02,514
It is a milestone, Tish.

34
00:07:02,682 --> 00:07:05,267
This very night, our 25th séance.

35
00:07:06,937 --> 00:07:10,358
All those years, gnawed by guilt,

36
00:07:11,232 --> 00:07:12,817
undone by woe,

37
00:07:13,611 --> 00:07:16,780
burning with uncertainty.

38
00:07:18,824 --> 00:07:21,034
Don't torture yourself, Gomez.

39
00:07:22,828 --> 00:07:24,330
That's my job.

40
00:07:25,874 --> 00:07:27,625
Oh, Tish.

41
00:07:28,793 --> 00:07:31,462
Imagine, darling,
if Fester did come back.

42
00:07:32,172 --> 00:07:35,800
Half alive, barely human,
a rotting shell.

43
00:07:36,469 --> 00:07:37,926
Don't tease.

44
00:07:51,025 --> 00:07:52,943
Stop it! I'm warning you.

45
00:07:58,992 --> 00:08:00,785
Look, darling. Tully is here.

46
00:08:02,538 --> 00:08:04,789
- Tully!
- Romping with Gate.

47
00:08:07,126 --> 00:08:09,837
These are your last paying clients,
may I remind you?

48
00:08:10,004 --> 00:08:12,380
- If it gives you pleasure.
- Something has to.

49
00:08:12,548 --> 00:08:15,758
Like a decent coat,
something dressy, for evening.

50
00:08:16,176 --> 00:08:17,886
Ask for a loan. Beg!

51
00:08:18,053 --> 00:08:20,055
No loans. I am not a bum.

52
00:08:20,348 --> 00:08:22,725
Don't say it. I'll get the money.

53
00:08:22,892 --> 00:08:24,184
I have a plan.

54
00:08:24,687 --> 00:08:26,353
This is all so humiliating.

55
00:08:26,521 --> 00:08:29,606
- Why did I marry you?
- Because I said yes.

56
00:08:30,234 --> 00:08:33,903
I'm here to see Mrs. Addams
about the charity auction.

57
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,074
Stop! Let go!

58
00:09:02,392 --> 00:09:04,227
- Missed!
- What's that?

59
00:09:11,235 --> 00:09:13,111
Dirty pool, old man.

60
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,113
I like it.

61
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,336
Had enough?

62
00:09:34,468 --> 00:09:36,010
Where's my pen?

63
00:09:36,971 --> 00:09:39,263
Never mind. I'll take yours.

64
00:09:46,606 --> 00:09:48,565
First, the old business.

65
00:09:50,109 --> 00:09:53,070
Charity auction, it's ridiculous!

66
00:09:54,614 --> 00:09:57,826
- Perhaps it's in here.
- I don't think so.

67
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:06,626
"Uncle Niknak's winter wardrobe. "

68
00:10:12,508 --> 00:10:14,968
"Uncle Niknak's summer wardrobe. "

69
00:10:18,265 --> 00:10:19,807
"Uncle Niknak. "

70
00:10:22,434 --> 00:10:25,771
"The Fester Addams
Offshore Retirement Fund?"

71
00:10:26,272 --> 00:10:28,941
- What would it do?
- What wouldn't it do?

72
00:10:29,109 --> 00:10:31,986
Fester, all tribute to thee.

73
00:10:32,153 --> 00:10:34,781
- Some called him inhumanly evil.
- No!

74
00:10:34,949 --> 00:10:37,950
Only our parents. I called him brother.

75
00:10:38,118 --> 00:10:41,788
And his memory must live on forever
through money.

76
00:10:42,164 --> 00:10:45,458
I'm gonna deposit the funds
under my name for tax purposes.

77
00:10:45,626 --> 00:10:46,835
That's inspired.

78
00:10:47,003 --> 00:10:50,297
He would've wanted it that way.
Beloved Fester.

79
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,592
Indeed!

80
00:10:55,178 --> 00:10:57,638
- For Fester!
- For Fester! A brother!

81
00:10:57,806 --> 00:10:59,222
- My brother!
- One of a kind!

82
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:02,435
- The doctors all said...
- Kind to animals, so good with children!

83
00:11:02,603 --> 00:11:05,438
- They never proved anything.
- $1 million is the perfect amount.

84
00:11:05,606 --> 00:11:08,066
- It's brilliant.
- It's untraceable!

85
00:11:10,944 --> 00:11:13,154
But, Tully, it's not old business.

86
00:11:13,322 --> 00:11:15,781
It's going to have to wait.
You know the rules better than that.

87
00:11:15,949 --> 00:11:19,411
Why? But this is different.
This is in my name. Make an exception!

88
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:22,456
Old business is old business
and new business is new business

89
00:11:22,623 --> 00:11:23,957
and this is new business

90
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:27,002
and we do not discuss
new business until

91
00:11:31,174 --> 00:11:32,674
next quarter.

92
00:11:32,842 --> 00:11:36,054
Next quarter?

93
00:11:38,432 --> 00:11:42,518
Fine lunge, but your riposte,
a tad rusty.

94
00:11:46,858 --> 00:11:48,274
Make yourself comfortable, old man,

95
00:11:48,442 --> 00:11:51,528
while I get the money
for the monthly expenses.

96
00:12:15,137 --> 00:12:18,641
There it is.
Just what we've been searching for.

97
00:12:19,641 --> 00:12:21,267
Thank you, Thing.

98
00:12:23,521 --> 00:12:26,606
My God, what is it?

99
00:12:26,941 --> 00:12:29,568
A finger trap
from the court of Emperor Wu.

100
00:12:29,736 --> 00:12:31,862
It must be worth a fortune.

101
00:12:32,614 --> 00:12:37,118
Oh, Morticia! This is too extravagant!

102
00:12:38,704 --> 00:12:40,079
Even for the auction.

103
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:42,289
Let's keep it.

104
00:12:42,792 --> 00:12:47,211
Hush, Mama. It's for charity.
Widows and orphans.

105
00:12:47,963 --> 00:12:49,797
We need more of them.

106
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:52,300
Margaret?

107
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,722
About the séance tonight.

108
00:12:56,472 --> 00:13:00,392
I wish you'd come. It's Gomez,
I'm terribly worried about him.

109
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:03,770
He won't eat. He can't sleep.

110
00:13:04,772 --> 00:13:06,941
He keeps coughing up blood.

111
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,610
He coughs up blood?

112
00:13:10,904 --> 00:13:12,990
Well, not like he used to.

113
00:13:16,702 --> 00:13:18,120
Down, kitty!

114
00:13:53,616 --> 00:13:56,160
There, the monthly expenses.

115
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:06,671
Miss Bradbury.

116
00:14:09,674 --> 00:14:11,133
Miss Bradbury!

117
00:14:11,301 --> 00:14:15,764
- She's gone home, Mr. Alford.
- Oh, Mrs. Craven!

118
00:14:16,724 --> 00:14:20,018
- I was just about to call you.
- I'm certain you were.

119
00:14:20,186 --> 00:14:23,563
You haven't met my son Gordon,
have you, Mr. Alford?

120
00:14:24,649 --> 00:14:25,816
Hello.

121
00:14:28,987 --> 00:14:32,907
Is this the one, Mother?
That deadbeat you mentioned?

122
00:14:34,743 --> 00:14:35,910
No, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait.

123
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:39,288
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.
You have to listen to me.

124
00:14:39,456 --> 00:14:42,083
Do we, Mr. Alford? And why?

125
00:14:42,501 --> 00:14:44,293
Please, hear me out!

126
00:14:45,922 --> 00:14:47,338
Hear me out!

127
00:14:47,631 --> 00:14:49,675
Please. Please!

128
00:14:50,969 --> 00:14:52,218
Your call, Mother.

129
00:14:52,386 --> 00:14:55,681
Gordon and I
enjoy a very special relationship.

130
00:14:55,849 --> 00:14:58,642
- She's a pip!
- Refreshing, no?

131
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:00,769
- Down, Gordon.
- Mother?

132
00:15:00,937 --> 00:15:02,521
- Gordon.
- Gordon!

133
00:15:05,066 --> 00:15:08,861
We've lent you a considerable sum,
many thousands of dollars.

134
00:15:09,112 --> 00:15:10,113
Payment due.

135
00:15:10,281 --> 00:15:12,448
I don't have the money to repay you.
I've tried everything.

136
00:15:12,616 --> 00:15:16,411
- Oh, Gordon, I want to believe him.
- So do I.

137
00:15:16,579 --> 00:15:17,745
Make me proud.

138
00:15:17,913 --> 00:15:19,622
No, no, no, no, no.

139
00:15:27,673 --> 00:15:30,842
- He lied to us, Mother.
- No, no. It's not what you think.

140
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:33,095
Those are doubloons
for the Addams account.

141
00:15:33,263 --> 00:15:34,305
Addams?

142
00:15:34,472 --> 00:15:36,849
There's more, there's a fortune,
but nobody can get to it.

143
00:15:37,018 --> 00:15:38,142
Don't you think I've tried?

144
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:40,978
Have you? Have you tried hard enough?

145
00:15:41,146 --> 00:15:44,816
- Ask him, sweetheart.
- No, no, no, sweetheart. Don't ask.

146
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:54,159
Fester.

147
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:03,794
- It's a miserable night.
- I know, darling.

148
00:16:04,503 --> 00:16:06,088
Séance weather.

149
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,800
Children, we're starting!

150
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,094
Put down that antenna.

151
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:22,731
It's unbelievable.
This hideous creature and my little boy.

152
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,903
They could be twins.

153
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:32,157
But they're his family. What
makes you think they'll fall for it?

154
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:35,035
You shave your head, we dress you up.
No problem.

155
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:37,038
They'll think he's Fester,
their long-lost brother.

156
00:16:37,206 --> 00:16:39,207
I hope so, Mr. Alford, for your sake.

157
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:41,291
Hey, I've been the Addams' lawyer
for years.

158
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:43,544
- They're morons.
- Obviously.

159
00:16:43,712 --> 00:16:45,922
- Now what about the gold?
- They got this vault, it's somewhere...

160
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:47,675
- Where?
- I'm not sure.

161
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:49,718
That's a problem, isn't it?

162
00:16:49,886 --> 00:16:52,595
Now listen,
Fester's been missing for 25 years.

163
00:16:52,763 --> 00:16:54,472
He and Gomez had some sort of a fight

164
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,059
and Gomez feels
incredibly guilty about it.

165
00:16:57,227 --> 00:16:59,061
He'll tell you anything. Just ask.

166
00:16:59,354 --> 00:17:02,773
- It's foolproof.
- It had better be. Now, get out.

167
00:17:04,234 --> 00:17:05,359
It's gonna be great.

168
00:17:05,527 --> 00:17:08,362
You're gonna get back
all the money I owe you and more.

169
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:09,780
You'll see. Really.

170
00:17:12,159 --> 00:17:15,787
This is it, Mother.
The one we've been waiting for.

171
00:17:15,955 --> 00:17:20,292
No more loan sharking,
no more storefront scams.

172
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:22,711
I get the gold, and we're gone.

173
00:17:22,879 --> 00:17:26,131
And Tully takes the rap.
Gordon, it's brilliant.

174
00:17:26,299 --> 00:17:27,967
No, not Gordon!

175
00:17:28,385 --> 00:17:30,928
- Of course not.
- Fester.

176
00:17:38,729 --> 00:17:41,397
Big night for you guys, eh, small fry?

177
00:17:43,318 --> 00:17:44,983
Hello, sweetheart.

178
00:17:45,902 --> 00:17:47,279
Could you?

179
00:17:52,451 --> 00:17:54,953
Oh, thank God.

180
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:57,456
Welcome, honored guests.

181
00:17:59,292 --> 00:18:00,585
Entrails?

182
00:18:15,392 --> 00:18:19,354
Sing, O spirits, hearken all souls.

183
00:18:20,189 --> 00:18:21,565
Every year on this date,

184
00:18:21,732 --> 00:18:24,651
we offer a clarion call
to Fester Addams.

185
00:18:24,819 --> 00:18:25,986
Stop it.

186
00:18:26,446 --> 00:18:27,696
Pugsley.

187
00:18:32,535 --> 00:18:33,661
Kids.

188
00:18:34,621 --> 00:18:36,830
From generation to generation,

189
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:39,708
our beacon to the beyond.

190
00:18:41,629 --> 00:18:44,381
All close eyes and join hands.

191
00:18:50,971 --> 00:18:52,347
What a grip!

192
00:18:53,641 --> 00:18:54,850
My hand!

193
00:18:56,143 --> 00:18:58,853
My hand! She's got my hand!

194
00:19:07,781 --> 00:19:09,990
- Excuse me.
- Okay, pumpkin, sit down.

195
00:19:10,158 --> 00:19:13,244
- Join the fun.
- Mama, you should know better.

196
00:19:14,162 --> 00:19:16,206
Thing, you're a handful.

197
00:19:16,749 --> 00:19:18,125
Wednesday.

198
00:19:18,792 --> 00:19:21,461
Let us ransom you
from the power of the grave.

199
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:24,381
Tonight, O Death, let us be your plague.

200
00:19:24,966 --> 00:19:26,258
Mama.

201
00:19:26,426 --> 00:19:28,260
Fester Addams,

202
00:19:35,476 --> 00:19:37,520
I feel that he's near.

203
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:43,443
Fester Addams, gather your strength

204
00:19:44,361 --> 00:19:46,779
and knock three times.

205
00:19:51,369 --> 00:19:52,743
Did you hear that?

206
00:19:53,329 --> 00:19:55,247
- Ask again, Mama, quickly.
- By all means.

207
00:19:55,415 --> 00:19:56,581
Ask. Ask.

208
00:19:56,748 --> 00:20:01,962
Fester Addams,
I demand that you knock again!

209
00:20:14,477 --> 00:20:16,102
He's at the door!

210
00:20:32,078 --> 00:20:33,786
- Could it be?
- Is it him?

211
00:20:33,954 --> 00:20:36,081
- Is it possible?
- Oh, my God.

212
00:20:39,126 --> 00:20:41,796
- Fester.
- Gomez.

213
00:21:00,191 --> 00:21:03,443
Good evening. I am Dr. Pinder-Schloss.

214
00:21:07,783 --> 00:21:11,744
He was found in Miami,
tangled in a tuna net.

215
00:21:11,912 --> 00:21:16,123
It was just last month
during the Hurricane Helga.

216
00:21:16,457 --> 00:21:19,418
The sky, it was black like pitch.

217
00:21:19,586 --> 00:21:23,798
The waves, they were walls of doom.
Can you imagine?

218
00:21:23,966 --> 00:21:27,301
They drag him from the ocean,
from the very jaws of oblivion.

219
00:21:27,469 --> 00:21:32,475
I'm telling you.
There were tests, so many tests!

220
00:21:32,684 --> 00:21:36,520
A complete psychological profile.

221
00:21:36,854 --> 00:21:37,981
At long last,

222
00:21:38,147 --> 00:21:40,691
the Florida Department
of the Fish and the Game,

223
00:21:40,859 --> 00:21:44,486
they say, "Lo and behold,
oh, my, oh, my, oh, my,

224
00:21:44,655 --> 00:21:47,031
"go tell it on the mountains,

225
00:21:47,866 --> 00:21:49,616
"he is your brother. "

226
00:21:51,955 --> 00:21:55,582
Boom! They give him to me
at Human Services,

227
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:59,504
and I am bringing him,
after all these years,

228
00:21:59,795 --> 00:22:02,298
after who knows what heartache,

229
00:22:02,465 --> 00:22:04,800
after the naked and the dead,

230
00:22:04,969 --> 00:22:07,970
I am bringing him home to you!

231
00:22:08,597 --> 00:22:10,306
- That's preposterous.
- Margaret...

232
00:22:10,473 --> 00:22:12,559
Isn't that the most ridiculous thing
you've ever heard?

233
00:22:12,727 --> 00:22:14,936
- Possibly...
- It certainly is.

234
00:22:17,814 --> 00:22:20,025
- Now you're back.
- Yes, back.

235
00:22:20,192 --> 00:22:23,235
Back to share your joys, your sorrows.

236
00:22:23,403 --> 00:22:26,573
- Hey, everything.
- Well, I just don't know.

237
00:22:26,741 --> 00:22:28,825
Honey, how does this work, again?

238
00:22:28,993 --> 00:22:31,120
An infant would understand.

239
00:22:34,081 --> 00:22:37,543
Fester Addams, home at long last.

240
00:22:37,918 --> 00:22:41,547
Well, at least for a week.

241
00:22:41,715 --> 00:22:44,925
- A week?
- Don't be ridiculous. You're home.

242
00:22:45,093 --> 00:22:46,802
Sorry, but I have to get back.

243
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:50,556
I've got a lot of things cooking
in the Bermuda Triangle.

244
00:22:50,724 --> 00:22:52,059
Oh, Gomez.

245
00:22:52,727 --> 00:22:55,562
- The Bermuda Triangle.
- Devil's Island.

246
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:57,731
The Black Hole of Calcutta.

247
00:22:57,899 --> 00:23:00,901
- Excuse us.
- Second honeymoon.

248
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,697
Dr. Pinder-Schloss,
will you be staying with us, too?

249
00:23:06,157 --> 00:23:08,326
No, no. I must be going.

250
00:23:08,494 --> 00:23:12,872
But I will be back, you can bet,
to be checking on Fester's adjustment.

251
00:23:14,291 --> 00:23:15,291
Cool.

252
00:23:15,459 --> 00:23:17,919
Nobody gets out of
the Bermuda Triangle.

253
00:23:18,087 --> 00:23:19,963
Not even for a vacation.

254
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:21,631
Everyone knows that.

255
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:25,552
Oh, my little bundle.
So much you don't understand.

256
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:29,473
The human spirit,
it is a hard thing to kill.

257
00:23:30,392 --> 00:23:32,601
Even with a chain saw.

258
00:23:41,487 --> 00:23:44,321
Unpacking? Let me.

259
00:23:44,989 --> 00:23:47,117
It's all right. I can do it.

260
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:49,661
Crowbar.

261
00:23:54,082 --> 00:23:55,291
Dynamite.

262
00:24:02,426 --> 00:24:03,759
Cyanide.

263
00:24:06,805 --> 00:24:09,974
Fester, as if we'd run out.

264
00:24:14,354 --> 00:24:15,730
Good night.

265
00:24:47,681 --> 00:24:49,348
Nosy little brat.

266
00:25:51,331 --> 00:25:52,791
Who's there?

267
00:26:28,663 --> 00:26:31,164
My own dear brother.

268
00:26:33,209 --> 00:26:36,795
- I've got goose bumps.
- I know.

269
00:26:38,298 --> 00:26:42,634
Screams in the night,
it can only mean one thing.

270
00:26:44,679 --> 00:26:46,014
He's home.

271
00:26:48,516 --> 00:26:50,978
Please! Please!

272
00:26:51,146 --> 00:26:53,646
Leave me alone!

273
00:27:20,718 --> 00:27:22,051
Breakfast?

274
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:26,681
Damn, it's good to have you back.
Let's go.

275
00:27:29,727 --> 00:27:31,353
Two out of three?

276
00:27:36,484 --> 00:27:38,318
Home cooking!

277
00:27:38,486 --> 00:27:41,322
There's nothing like it in the world.

278
00:27:41,781 --> 00:27:43,574
May I have the salt?

279
00:27:45,619 --> 00:27:47,244
What do we say?

280
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:49,664
Now.

281
00:27:59,592 --> 00:28:03,679
- What is this?
- Mama's spécialité de la maison.

282
00:28:04,013 --> 00:28:05,722
Oh, Tish.

283
00:28:08,475 --> 00:28:10,268
Start with the eyes.

284
00:28:12,815 --> 00:28:14,649
Did you sleep well?

285
00:28:16,109 --> 00:28:18,320
- Like the dead.
- Really?

286
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:20,113
Who would have thought
the Bermuda Triangle

287
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,739
could change a man so much?

288
00:28:21,907 --> 00:28:25,994
You used to toss and turn all night.
We had to chain you to the bedpost.

289
00:28:26,161 --> 00:28:27,955
Doesn't make sense.

290
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:33,961
The Bermuda Triangle is a very strange
and mysterious place.

291
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:37,798
You'd be surprised
at all the things you don't know.

292
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,968
She certainly would.

293
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:43,554
Wednesday adores
the Bermuda Triangle.

294
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,890
She studies it.
Death at sea, she's hooked.

295
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,726
Ask me anything.

296
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:55,483
Being in my old room
sure brings back memories.

297
00:28:56,819 --> 00:29:00,155
- Remember Camp Custer?
- For preteen offenders.

298
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:11,667
Aren't memories precious?

299
00:29:12,169 --> 00:29:15,671
Today I'd like to wander
through the house, remembering.

300
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:18,050
No, no. Sorry, old man.
No wandering today.

301
00:29:18,217 --> 00:29:20,634
Today we're going straight to the vault.

302
00:29:30,813 --> 00:29:33,356
Bravo, Pugsley!

303
00:29:39,489 --> 00:29:40,822
- "Greed"!
- "Greed"!

304
00:29:49,374 --> 00:29:51,834
I feel like we're children again.

305
00:29:52,044 --> 00:29:53,586
Tag. You're it!

306
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:18,570
Smell that air, Fester.

307
00:30:22,326 --> 00:30:23,701
Like a tomb.

308
00:30:30,876 --> 00:30:33,419
The sea, your second home.

309
00:30:34,713 --> 00:30:36,214
Ship ahoy.

310
00:30:51,857 --> 00:30:54,025
Do you think that's really Uncle Fester?

311
00:30:54,193 --> 00:30:57,194
Father says so,
but I think Mother isn't sure.

312
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,492
Pugsley, sit in the chair.

313
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,828
- Why?
- So we can play a game.

314
00:31:10,334 --> 00:31:11,669
What game?

315
00:31:12,962 --> 00:31:16,507
It's called, "Is There a God?"

316
00:31:41,326 --> 00:31:42,702
The vault!

317
00:31:44,163 --> 00:31:47,623
Two to the right, ten to the left.

318
00:31:47,791 --> 00:31:50,418
And then around to...

319
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,045
Five.

320
00:31:52,963 --> 00:31:54,172
Eleven.

321
00:31:55,132 --> 00:31:58,134
Two, ten, eleven. Eyes, fingers, toes.

322
00:31:58,844 --> 00:32:00,345
So many years.

323
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:12,650
- Welcome back.
- Thanks.

324
00:32:13,818 --> 00:32:15,820
Our secret place.

325
00:32:19,032 --> 00:32:21,826
If these walls could speak, eh, old man?

326
00:32:21,994 --> 00:32:25,997
- What would they say?
- You tell me.

327
00:32:26,832 --> 00:32:28,166
You first.

328
00:32:29,168 --> 00:32:30,669
Senior partner.

329
00:32:31,462 --> 00:32:33,005
Junior spaceman.

330
00:32:35,132 --> 00:32:36,883
First a brandy. Do the honors.

331
00:32:37,051 --> 00:32:39,178
I've got a real treat in store.

332
00:32:39,346 --> 00:32:41,931
Where is it, you ridiculous imbecile?

333
00:33:27,146 --> 00:33:28,938
Show time!

334
00:33:58,804 --> 00:34:01,221
There, the debutante ball.

335
00:34:02,725 --> 00:34:04,893
Remember that fateful night?

336
00:34:05,854 --> 00:34:07,188
Of course.

337
00:34:12,569 --> 00:34:13,985
Your first cigar.

338
00:34:14,153 --> 00:34:17,489
What? Come on, old man.
I've smoked since I was five.

339
00:34:17,656 --> 00:34:19,325
Mother insisted.

340
00:34:21,495 --> 00:34:24,288
Flora and Fauna.

341
00:34:24,581 --> 00:34:27,000
Quite the pair, eh, Gomez?

342
00:34:27,335 --> 00:34:29,085
Can you ever forgive me?

343
00:34:30,962 --> 00:34:32,005
What?

344
00:34:32,465 --> 00:34:34,423
I didn't love them,

345
00:34:34,591 --> 00:34:37,844
yet I wooed them both
out of foolish pride.

346
00:34:38,805 --> 00:34:41,473
You were so dashing,
you could have any woman you wanted,

347
00:34:41,641 --> 00:34:43,142
dead or alive.

348
00:34:43,769 --> 00:34:45,227
I was jealous.

349
00:34:45,395 --> 00:34:47,604
Insanely jealous.

350
00:34:47,772 --> 00:34:49,482
I admit that now.

351
00:34:52,569 --> 00:34:55,321
But I did not mean to drive you off,

352
00:34:55,489 --> 00:34:57,657
not to the Bermuda Triangle.

353
00:34:58,158 --> 00:34:59,993
Water under the bridge.

354
00:35:00,494 --> 00:35:02,620
Forgiven. Forgotten.

355
00:35:10,339 --> 00:35:12,172
Come on. Say it.

356
00:35:13,007 --> 00:35:15,718
- Say the secret password.
- The password?

357
00:35:16,512 --> 00:35:18,679
Come on. Stop fooling. You remember.

358
00:35:18,847 --> 00:35:21,766
Please. I'm choking. Please.

359
00:35:21,934 --> 00:35:24,643
You forgot our secret password?

360
00:35:24,811 --> 00:35:27,189
The word we used 100 times a day?

361
00:35:27,357 --> 00:35:29,482
Our special private name
for each other?

362
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:31,818
That was a long time ago
when we were children.

363
00:35:31,986 --> 00:35:33,319
You almost killed me,

364
00:35:33,487 --> 00:35:37,324
you demented freak.

365
00:35:37,492 --> 00:35:40,828
Poor devil, what did they do to you
in that Bermuda Triangle?

366
00:35:40,996 --> 00:35:43,497
But if he's not Uncle Fester,
then who is he?

367
00:35:43,666 --> 00:35:45,165
Somebody else.

368
00:35:48,253 --> 00:35:49,503
It has to warm up.

369
00:35:49,671 --> 00:35:52,756
- Why?
- So it can kill you.

370
00:35:53,384 --> 00:35:54,884
I knew that.

371
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:59,389
- Children, what are you doing?
- I'm going to electrocute him.

372
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:01,682
But we're late for the charity auction.

373
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:04,395
- But, Mother...
- I said no.

374
00:36:05,021 --> 00:36:06,229
Please?

375
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:08,690
Oh, all right.

376
00:36:18,534 --> 00:36:19,952
This magnificent piece

377
00:36:20,537 --> 00:36:24,123
is encrusted with rubies
and 15 emerald chips.

378
00:36:24,459 --> 00:36:29,712
It was donated
by Morticia and Gomez Addams.

379
00:36:29,964 --> 00:36:32,466
Remember, this year,
over half our proceeds

380
00:36:32,633 --> 00:36:35,761
will benefit the elderly
and the mentally disabled.

381
00:36:36,429 --> 00:36:39,515
I'll open the bidding at $5,000.

382
00:36:39,682 --> 00:36:42,309
Five... Not good enough.

383
00:36:42,477 --> 00:36:44,686
- $20,000.
- What are they doing?

384
00:36:44,855 --> 00:36:47,524
- I have 20.
- Twenty-five.

385
00:36:48,233 --> 00:36:49,566
Twenty-five.

386
00:36:49,734 --> 00:36:50,985
Thirty.

387
00:36:52,111 --> 00:36:53,530
Thirty-five!

388
00:36:55,573 --> 00:36:59,494
- Fifty.
- I have $50,000.

389
00:36:59,662 --> 00:37:01,037
Your turn, my ecstasy.

390
00:37:01,205 --> 00:37:04,792
$50,000, going once.
$50,000, going twice.

391
00:37:06,627 --> 00:37:11,048
Sold to Morticia Addams for $50,000.

392
00:37:22,519 --> 00:37:24,479
Isn't it too enchanting?

393
00:37:24,647 --> 00:37:26,523
How do you take it off?

394
00:37:29,318 --> 00:37:31,279
There's a trick to it,

395
00:37:33,656 --> 00:37:35,032
of course.

396
00:37:45,376 --> 00:37:48,171
"How do you take it off?" That's absurd.

397
00:37:48,505 --> 00:37:52,008
That finger trap was a party favor
at his 10th birthday!

398
00:37:56,805 --> 00:37:58,056
Oh, no.

399
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,349
Father's playing with his trains.

400
00:38:02,019 --> 00:38:04,313
He wore that finger trap for two years!

401
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,481
Mother had to teach him
to eat with his feet.

402
00:38:06,649 --> 00:38:09,276
And the combination and the password

403
00:38:09,444 --> 00:38:12,030
and my cigar and he slept so well!

404
00:38:15,742 --> 00:38:17,159
He's using the diesel.

405
00:38:28,757 --> 00:38:29,839
The covered bridge.

406
00:38:33,218 --> 00:38:34,428
Dead man's curve.

407
00:39:28,277 --> 00:39:30,946
It's all about Uncle Fester, isn't it?

408
00:39:40,998 --> 00:39:43,750
Spirits above me, give me a sign.

409
00:39:44,293 --> 00:39:47,004
Shall I be joyous or shall I be damned?

410
00:40:02,855 --> 00:40:04,522
Sleepless night?

411
00:40:07,444 --> 00:40:09,237
Walk with me, Fester.

412
00:40:15,326 --> 00:40:16,827
Aunt LaBorgia.

413
00:40:17,287 --> 00:40:19,496
Executed by a firing squad.

414
00:40:20,999 --> 00:40:22,500
Cousin Fledge.

415
00:40:23,001 --> 00:40:26,087
Torn limb from limb by four wild horses.

416
00:40:27,673 --> 00:40:29,966
Darling Uncle Eimar.

417
00:40:32,845 --> 00:40:34,304
Buried alive.

418
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,684
Psychopaths, fiends,

419
00:40:38,852 --> 00:40:40,519
mad-dog killers.

420
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:44,022
Brutes, Fester. Pioneers.

421
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:46,193
Lest we forget.

422
00:40:47,485 --> 00:40:49,320
Your beloved Muerto.

423
00:40:51,114 --> 00:40:54,325
After you left,
he was simply a different vulture.

424
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:57,829
He wouldn't circle.

425
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:00,498
He wouldn't peck.

426
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:04,669
That's how much
you mean to this family.

427
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:13,845
Mother and Father Addams.

428
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:18,559
How I wish the children
could have known them better.

429
00:41:19,353 --> 00:41:21,687
But tell that to an angry mob.

430
00:41:25,068 --> 00:41:29,863
And our credo,
"Sic gorgiamus allos subjectatos nunc. "

431
00:41:30,657 --> 00:41:33,991
We gladly feast
on those who would subdue us.

432
00:41:34,911 --> 00:41:36,828
Not just pretty words.

433
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:44,545
As an Addams,
you understand completely, don't you?

434
00:41:47,089 --> 00:41:50,175
As an Addams, yes, I do.

435
00:41:53,763 --> 00:41:55,515
Good night, Fester.

436
00:41:58,059 --> 00:41:59,602
Rest in peace.

437
00:42:08,946 --> 00:42:11,072
They're on to me, Mother.
I'm almost sure.

438
00:42:11,616 --> 00:42:13,451
Of course I tried.
I still can't find it.

439
00:42:13,618 --> 00:42:14,617
You've got to get over here.

440
00:42:14,785 --> 00:42:17,079
Arsenic, cyanide. Cyanide.
Arsenic, arsenic.

441
00:42:17,581 --> 00:42:19,124
Don't say that.

442
00:42:20,416 --> 00:42:21,917
You know I do.

443
00:42:24,129 --> 00:42:28,048
His trains are everywhere.
The children are beside themselves.

444
00:42:28,718 --> 00:42:30,718
Is that for your brother?

445
00:42:31,052 --> 00:42:32,679
I don't think so.

446
00:42:40,688 --> 00:42:42,314
This can't go on.

447
00:42:42,481 --> 00:42:44,984
How can I help him? Tell me, Mama.

448
00:42:46,528 --> 00:42:48,946
"Troubled husbands. "

449
00:42:49,114 --> 00:42:50,823
- "Adultery"?
- Oh, no.

450
00:42:51,825 --> 00:42:54,702
- "Financial, money troubles"?
- No.

451
00:42:55,913 --> 00:42:59,373
- "Turned into toad or reptile. "
- Is there an index?

452
00:43:01,376 --> 00:43:04,295
They know I'm a fraud, the whole bunch.

453
00:43:04,922 --> 00:43:06,298
It's not going to work.

454
00:43:06,466 --> 00:43:09,801
Who knows?
Gomez, that overheated moron?

455
00:43:10,261 --> 00:43:12,847
He's no moron. He's Fester's brother.

456
00:43:13,015 --> 00:43:14,555
They had some awful fight years ago.

457
00:43:14,724 --> 00:43:16,809
He's suspicious,
they all are, I can tell.

458
00:43:16,977 --> 00:43:19,186
Really? Well,
thank God I came over here.

459
00:43:19,354 --> 00:43:23,859
I will counsel the troubled family,
ease their distress.

460
00:43:24,026 --> 00:43:26,653
It's my calling. Remember, Gordon?

461
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:29,823
- What?
- I'm a doctor.

462
00:43:32,618 --> 00:43:36,162
Why don't you speak to Fester, darling?
He's right outside the door.

463
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:39,458
I would speak with Fester
if that were Fester.

464
00:43:39,668 --> 00:43:42,836
But that is not. That's an impostor!

465
00:43:43,004 --> 00:43:45,464
An impostore!

466
00:43:45,674 --> 00:43:48,342
A charlatan! A sham!

467
00:43:48,677 --> 00:43:50,178
A counterfeit.

468
00:43:57,686 --> 00:44:01,022
O, villain, villain,
smiling, damned villain!

469
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:03,358
Who calls me a villain?
Breaks my pate across?

470
00:44:03,526 --> 00:44:04,693
- Bloodshed.
- Plucks off my beard,

471
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:08,655
- and blows it in my face?
- If I must strike you dead, I will.

472
00:44:18,749 --> 00:44:19,792
No!

473
00:44:20,127 --> 00:44:23,380
No, no, no, no, no, no!

474
00:44:25,089 --> 00:44:26,841
Give me that sword.

475
00:44:27,759 --> 00:44:29,927
Haven't you ever slaughtered anyone?

476
00:44:30,095 --> 00:44:32,806
- He's only a child.
- No excuse.

477
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:36,601
Aim for a major artery. The jugular.

478
00:44:36,769 --> 00:44:39,938
A faker! A phony!

479
00:44:40,107 --> 00:44:41,815
An utter fraud!

480
00:44:42,233 --> 00:44:46,278
- A base, deceitful...
- Mr. Addams!

481
00:44:47,573 --> 00:44:50,783
I believe I am understanding.
I can help, yes?

482
00:44:51,409 --> 00:44:54,745
The theory of displacement.

483
00:44:55,414 --> 00:44:57,081
Is this familiar?

484
00:44:57,666 --> 00:44:58,916
No. Tish?

485
00:44:59,084 --> 00:45:01,586
Oh, it is too exciting.

486
00:45:01,962 --> 00:45:03,629
I will explain.

487
00:45:03,922 --> 00:45:05,882
Is it unpleasant?

488
00:45:06,593 --> 00:45:07,801
Deeply.

489
00:45:09,929 --> 00:45:14,016
Your very own brother,
you drive him away.

490
00:45:14,184 --> 00:45:15,976
"Go. Off with you. "

491
00:45:16,352 --> 00:45:20,189
But then you are feeling
the little black monster.

492
00:45:20,356 --> 00:45:22,859
- Pugsley.
- Guilt. Yes?

493
00:45:23,527 --> 00:45:26,613
Your brother returns, you feel guilty,

494
00:45:26,781 --> 00:45:29,364
- you displace.
- I do?

495
00:45:29,699 --> 00:45:33,411
The feelings in your brain cells,
they bubble and collide.

496
00:45:34,122 --> 00:45:36,623
You suspect things.

497
00:45:36,791 --> 00:45:39,502
You love him, but you resent him.

498
00:45:40,003 --> 00:45:42,128
Love, hate. Hate, love.

499
00:45:43,173 --> 00:45:44,839
Like for Mama. No?

500
00:45:45,342 --> 00:45:48,259
But I didn't hate my mother,
it was an accident.

501
00:45:48,427 --> 00:45:52,848
It's a very common psychosis,
I'm seeing it every day.

502
00:45:53,141 --> 00:45:54,643
Lucky doctor.

503
00:45:55,185 --> 00:45:58,521
Displacement. How bizarre.

504
00:45:58,688 --> 00:46:01,524
And here I thought
Fester was the problem.

505
00:46:02,192 --> 00:46:03,527
- He's sullen.
- He's furtive.

506
00:46:03,694 --> 00:46:04,820
- Backstabbing.
- He sulks.

507
00:46:04,986 --> 00:46:06,321
- I suspect him.
- You're unbalanced.

508
00:46:06,489 --> 00:46:10,033
And I hate him. By God, you're right!

509
00:46:10,535 --> 00:46:12,202
He is Fester!

510
00:46:12,577 --> 00:46:14,831
Thank you, Dr. Pinder-Schloss.

511
00:46:15,373 --> 00:46:16,999
I do what I can.

512
00:46:17,167 --> 00:46:19,918
You see, children,
there's lots to learn.

513
00:46:24,049 --> 00:46:25,423
"Gangrene. "

514
00:46:27,386 --> 00:46:29,512
Uncle Fester,
how do you know so much?

515
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:32,223
I've been around. I pick things up.

516
00:46:32,558 --> 00:46:34,517
In the Bermuda Triangle?

517
00:46:36,436 --> 00:46:38,688
Look, children, a new chapter.

518
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:41,525
- "Scabs. "
- "Scabs. "

519
00:46:48,616 --> 00:46:51,869
Three parts dynamite
with a nitroglycerin cap.

520
00:46:52,078 --> 00:46:55,832
It's perfect for small holes,
carports and tool sheds.

521
00:47:02,672 --> 00:47:03,882
Mother.

522
00:47:04,717 --> 00:47:07,177
Everyone will be
at the children's play tonight, correct?

523
00:47:07,344 --> 00:47:09,345
Oh, yes. I've been working with them.

524
00:47:09,513 --> 00:47:12,015
- It's going to be fun.
- Fun?

525
00:47:13,851 --> 00:47:16,437
Is that what we're here for? Fun?

526
00:47:17,272 --> 00:47:19,899
Darling, forgive me.
You see what they've driven me to?

527
00:47:20,066 --> 00:47:23,444
I've raised a hand to my child,
my reason for living.

528
00:47:25,323 --> 00:47:29,033
- You can't go to the play.
- But the kids...

529
00:47:29,201 --> 00:47:31,703
The house will be deserted.
The vault will be ours.

530
00:47:31,871 --> 00:47:33,246
But, Mother...

531
00:47:34,707 --> 00:47:36,791
Can you hear it, my treasure?

532
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:39,543
My heartbeat. It beats only for you.

533
00:47:39,711 --> 00:47:42,464
Listen closely.
It says, "Gordon, I love you,

534
00:47:42,632 --> 00:47:44,717
"Gordon, the vault. "

535
00:47:45,843 --> 00:47:47,344
I do hear it.

536
00:47:47,679 --> 00:47:51,641
Soon we'll have the money
and we'll be far from here.

537
00:47:52,059 --> 00:47:55,145
Loving mother, grateful son.

538
00:47:55,811 --> 00:47:56,938
Understood?

539
00:48:03,070 --> 00:48:05,155
There you are, at last.

540
00:48:06,366 --> 00:48:09,075
What a fool I was to doubt you.

541
00:48:09,243 --> 00:48:11,995
Dr. Pinder-Schloss
explained everything.

542
00:48:12,163 --> 00:48:14,498
What a lovely woman. So chilly.

543
00:48:14,916 --> 00:48:18,043
Displacement. It's a common psychosis.

544
00:48:18,211 --> 00:48:20,295
- Isn't that grand?
- Is it?

545
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:23,048
Look at it, Fester.

546
00:48:23,216 --> 00:48:27,553
The primeval ooze.
Quicksand, fumes, toxic waste.

547
00:48:27,721 --> 00:48:31,849
It's all ours, Fester.
You belong here, old man.

548
00:48:32,185 --> 00:48:34,978
- Stay.
- You don't know what you're asking.

549
00:48:35,730 --> 00:48:39,189
You have a beautiful wife,
wonderful children,

550
00:48:40,025 --> 00:48:41,485
a wasteland.

551
00:48:42,569 --> 00:48:44,154
I'm in the way.

552
00:48:44,863 --> 00:48:46,030
In the way?

553
00:48:46,866 --> 00:48:49,535
- My brother?
- Gomez, take care!

554
00:48:51,371 --> 00:48:54,206
For you, life is all fun and games.

555
00:48:55,042 --> 00:48:58,128
A dance in a graveyard. Stench. Decay.

556
00:48:58,671 --> 00:49:02,173
- But things change.
- Precisely. You're back.

557
00:49:03,216 --> 00:49:06,051
All those years apart, Fester.

558
00:49:06,678 --> 00:49:08,555
We can't do that again.

559
00:49:11,351 --> 00:49:12,934
You're home.

560
00:49:36,752 --> 00:49:37,919
Fore!

561
00:49:42,383 --> 00:49:44,258
Damn you, Addams!

562
00:49:50,558 --> 00:49:51,851
Uncle Fester?

563
00:49:52,019 --> 00:49:54,771
Come on, Uncle Fester.
Come to the play.

564
00:49:55,522 --> 00:49:57,440
I said I was busy.

565
00:49:57,775 --> 00:50:02,111
But you said you'd help us,
with the Shakespeare and the pus.

566
00:50:02,279 --> 00:50:03,946
I changed my mind.

567
00:50:18,755 --> 00:50:21,423
Mrs. Addams,
can I see you for a moment?

568
00:50:22,592 --> 00:50:25,052
I'm Susan Firkins.
I'm Wednesday's teacher.

569
00:50:25,221 --> 00:50:26,720
Oh, of course, Miss Firkins.

570
00:50:26,888 --> 00:50:29,474
Wednesday's told us
so much about you.

571
00:50:38,109 --> 00:50:42,822
Wednesday is an excellent student,
but, frankly, I'm concerned.

572
00:50:42,989 --> 00:50:45,365
You see,
this is our class bulletin board.

573
00:50:45,533 --> 00:50:50,078
This month, our theme is our heroes,
people we love and admire.

574
00:50:50,538 --> 00:50:53,457
You see, Susan Ringo
has chosen the President.

575
00:50:53,625 --> 00:50:55,126
Isn't that sweet?

576
00:50:55,627 --> 00:50:58,797
And Harmony Feld
has picked Jane Pauley.

577
00:51:00,757 --> 00:51:03,051
Have you spoken to her parents?

578
00:51:03,802 --> 00:51:07,179
But Wednesday brought in this picture,

579
00:51:07,347 --> 00:51:09,266
Calpurnia Addams.

580
00:51:09,725 --> 00:51:12,602
Wednesday's great-aunt Calpurnia.

581
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:15,523
She was burned as a witch in 1706.

582
00:51:15,858 --> 00:51:18,775
They say she danced naked
in the town square

583
00:51:18,943 --> 00:51:20,945
and enslaved a minister.

584
00:51:21,696 --> 00:51:23,864
- Really?
- Oh, yes.

585
00:51:24,532 --> 00:51:28,953
But don't worry.
We've told Wednesday, college first.

586
00:51:30,164 --> 00:51:33,207
Isn't he adorable?

587
00:51:33,833 --> 00:51:37,003
- I made this myself.
- It's charming.

588
00:51:37,171 --> 00:51:38,921
What is he, a lizard?

589
00:51:39,423 --> 00:51:40,673
An elf.

590
00:51:41,801 --> 00:51:43,469
Look at you.

591
00:51:49,976 --> 00:51:51,810
That's better.

592
00:51:52,187 --> 00:51:54,855
You are too precious for words.

593
00:51:55,023 --> 00:51:57,608
Why, I could just eat you alive.

594
00:51:58,027 --> 00:52:00,195
Oh, no, Margaret. Too young.

595
00:52:31,771 --> 00:52:35,022
Wednesday. Pugsley.
I changed my mind.

596
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:37,400
Uncle Fester.

597
00:52:44,032 --> 00:52:46,034
Gordon? Gordon?

598
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:48,537
It's Mother.

599
00:52:51,707 --> 00:52:53,543
Damn it, where is he?

600
00:52:54,418 --> 00:52:56,754
I never should have used him.

601
00:53:07,183 --> 00:53:09,893
I knew you couldn't stay away, old man.

602
00:53:29,498 --> 00:53:30,748
Damn it.

603
00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:34,459
Gordon! Gordon!

604
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:36,129
Are you there?

605
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:39,007
Gordon.

606
00:53:43,512 --> 00:53:46,015
My goodness! Say! Look!
Would somebody come here!

607
00:53:46,182 --> 00:53:47,974
Oh, my! Oh, good...

608
00:53:48,726 --> 00:53:50,144
Oh, my!

609
00:53:51,521 --> 00:53:53,397
How all occasions
do inform against me,

610
00:53:53,565 --> 00:53:55,274
And spur my dull revenge!

611
00:53:55,442 --> 00:53:56,650
O, from this time forth,

612
00:53:56,819 --> 00:53:58,737
My thoughts be bloody,
or nothing worth!

613
00:53:58,903 --> 00:54:01,405
If I must strike you dead, I will.

614
00:54:04,659 --> 00:54:05,826
A hit,

615
00:54:06,412 --> 00:54:08,872
a very palpable hit.

616
00:54:19,551 --> 00:54:21,343
O proud death,

617
00:54:21,510 --> 00:54:24,388
What feast is toward
in thine eternal cell?

618
00:54:26,683 --> 00:54:30,019
Sweet oblivion, open your arms!

619
00:54:47,581 --> 00:54:48,914
Bravo!

620
00:54:50,583 --> 00:54:53,043
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

621
00:54:54,141 --> 00:54:55,905
Bravo!

622
00:55:01,095 --> 00:55:04,013
There were sailors, pirates

623
00:55:04,847 --> 00:55:08,518
and a plane full of tourists
from Miami Beach,

624
00:55:09,229 --> 00:55:11,313
all lost in the Triangle.

625
00:55:11,855 --> 00:55:14,857
Uncle Fester,
will you take me there someday?

626
00:55:15,109 --> 00:55:16,652
It's a promise.

627
00:55:17,570 --> 00:55:19,196
- Good night, Wednesday.
- Good night.

628
00:55:19,364 --> 00:55:21,031
You were terrific.

629
00:55:23,326 --> 00:55:24,786
Uncle Fester?

630
00:55:46,643 --> 00:55:48,435
A theatrical triumph.

631
00:55:49,228 --> 00:55:50,896
It's like a dream.

632
00:55:51,314 --> 00:55:54,650
When we first met,
it was an evening much like this.

633
00:55:55,276 --> 00:55:56,902
Magic in the air.

634
00:55:57,989 --> 00:55:59,154
A boy.

635
00:55:59,948 --> 00:56:01,158
A girl.

636
00:56:01,908 --> 00:56:03,410
An open grave.

637
00:56:04,161 --> 00:56:06,120
It was my first funeral.

638
00:56:06,914 --> 00:56:08,998
You were so beautiful.

639
00:56:09,791 --> 00:56:11,626
Pale and mysterious.

640
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:15,046
No one even looked at the corpse.

641
00:56:15,547 --> 00:56:17,507
Your cousin, Balthazar.

642
00:56:18,177 --> 00:56:20,177
You were still a suspect.

643
00:56:21,554 --> 00:56:25,182
I couldn't stop staring at you
all through the eulogy.

644
00:56:26,517 --> 00:56:29,979
Your eyes, your moustache,

645
00:56:31,356 --> 00:56:32,689
your laugh.

646
00:56:34,526 --> 00:56:36,193
You bewitched me.

647
00:56:37,613 --> 00:56:39,697
I proposed that very night.

648
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:44,369
Just think,
someday we'll be buried here

649
00:56:44,996 --> 00:56:47,790
side by side, six feet under

650
00:56:48,166 --> 00:56:50,042
in matching coffins.

651
00:56:51,044 --> 00:56:53,212
Our lifeless bodies

652
00:56:53,379 --> 00:56:57,467
rotting together for all eternity.

653
00:56:59,844 --> 00:57:01,387
Cara mia.

654
00:57:02,890 --> 00:57:04,516
Mon sauvage.

655
00:57:35,383 --> 00:57:37,091
Hey, Bigfoot.

656
00:57:41,556 --> 00:57:43,765
Don't stare. Just get me out.

657
00:57:50,523 --> 00:57:51,524
Did you like the blood?

658
00:57:53,067 --> 00:57:55,695
- I was so proud.
- Weren't we all?

659
00:57:56,530 --> 00:57:58,781
Wednesday, play with your food.

660
00:58:06,748 --> 00:58:07,916
Mama.

661
00:58:08,084 --> 00:58:09,876
Who put this in here?

662
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:15,424
- That's for company.
- Rascals.

663
00:58:16,341 --> 00:58:19,219
Doctor, you were so right.

664
00:58:19,386 --> 00:58:22,139
- What an evening.
- Fester fit right in.

665
00:58:22,308 --> 00:58:25,601
- The displacement is over.
- Well, isn't that nice.

666
00:58:25,810 --> 00:58:29,354
- Does he really have to go?
- Yes, he does.

667
00:58:29,522 --> 00:58:32,691
Well, if he insists upon leaving,

668
00:58:33,151 --> 00:58:35,361
we shall mark the occasion.

669
00:58:36,154 --> 00:58:37,322
Tish?

670
00:58:37,489 --> 00:58:42,076
- We've planned a farewell party.
- We've invited the entire clan.

671
00:58:42,536 --> 00:58:44,580
What a lovely gesture.

672
00:58:44,831 --> 00:58:46,539
We're a family again

673
00:58:46,707 --> 00:58:49,084
and we owe it all to you,
Dr. Pinder-Schloss.

674
00:58:49,252 --> 00:58:51,544
Please. Greta.

675
00:58:52,005 --> 00:58:53,087
Greta.

676
00:58:54,341 --> 00:58:56,508
Fester, walk me out.

677
00:59:01,097 --> 00:59:04,850
I'm fine, Mother.
I'm completely in control.

678
00:59:05,019 --> 00:59:07,354
They're not your family, Gordon. I am.

679
00:59:07,521 --> 00:59:09,272
They don't love you. I do.

680
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:12,860
They're evil and corrupt and degraded.

681
00:59:13,027 --> 00:59:16,237
- I can give you that.
- I'm fine. Really.

682
00:59:16,614 --> 00:59:18,449
We'll see. Open up!

683
00:59:47,562 --> 00:59:48,855
A party?

684
00:59:49,692 --> 00:59:50,857
For me?

685
00:59:52,276 --> 00:59:53,360
Here?

686
01:00:00,869 --> 01:00:05,039
Tish, how long has it been
since we've waltzed?

687
01:00:05,958 --> 01:00:07,375
Oh, Gomez.

688
01:00:12,090 --> 01:00:13,255
Hours.

689
01:01:20,661 --> 01:01:22,079
It, old man!

690
01:01:24,624 --> 01:01:26,876
You're right. Far too long.

691
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:36,135
- Don't let me out of your sight.
- Don't threaten me, Margaret.

692
01:01:36,303 --> 01:01:39,306
- These people are abnormal.
- Don't exaggerate.

693
01:01:45,854 --> 01:01:48,649
Oh, by all means!
They're clients, Margaret.

694
01:01:56,199 --> 01:01:58,617
- Wednesday?
- Yes, Mother?

695
01:01:58,785 --> 01:02:02,287
Would you run upstairs
and check on your uncle, please?

696
01:02:03,457 --> 01:02:06,501
Why, Lumpy Addams. Look at you.

697
01:02:07,377 --> 01:02:08,837
All grown up.

698
01:02:21,267 --> 01:02:22,726
Uncle Fester?

699
01:02:25,730 --> 01:02:27,731
- I understand.
- I hope so.

700
01:02:27,899 --> 01:02:29,191
And I'm counting on you.

701
01:02:29,359 --> 01:02:31,986
Don't let me down. Don't buckle.

702
01:02:32,154 --> 01:02:34,989
It's not gonna be easy.
There are people everywhere.

703
01:02:35,157 --> 01:02:37,867
You can do it if you just stop whining.

704
01:02:38,536 --> 01:02:41,036
Nobody likes that. It's unattractive.

705
01:02:41,204 --> 01:02:45,708
All right. Fine.
I will try and reach the vault tonight.

706
01:02:46,169 --> 01:02:49,589
But if I can't, well, then that's it.

707
01:02:50,715 --> 01:02:52,174
Okay, Mother?

708
01:02:52,508 --> 01:02:55,219
I knew it. You are a fake.

709
01:02:55,511 --> 01:02:57,762
Come here, my little one.

710
01:02:57,930 --> 01:02:59,724
- Wednesday!
- Get her!

711
01:03:45,356 --> 01:03:48,441
Flora and Fauna Amor.

712
01:03:49,694 --> 01:03:51,361
I cannot see.

713
01:03:51,737 --> 01:03:54,491
I am blinded by such beauty.

714
01:03:54,658 --> 01:03:55,740
Gomez Addams.

715
01:03:55,908 --> 01:03:57,618
- You terrible flirt.
- Always was.

716
01:03:57,786 --> 01:03:58,953
- At least with me.
- Copycat!

717
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:02,498
- Tag-along!
- Why, Gomez, the Amor twins.

718
01:04:02,749 --> 01:04:05,167
- I've heard so much about you.
- Morticia...

719
01:04:05,335 --> 01:04:07,044
- You nabbed him.
- This darling man.

720
01:04:07,212 --> 01:04:08,879
- He was mine!
- He was mine!

721
01:04:09,047 --> 01:04:11,423
Flora, Fauna, how can I compete?

722
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:14,010
You're twice the woman I am.

723
01:04:14,345 --> 01:04:16,888
Tully, the Amor twins.

724
01:04:17,223 --> 01:04:19,891
They're waiting for Fester. Amuse them.

725
01:04:22,353 --> 01:04:24,896
- Hello, Tully.
- Oh, my God.

726
01:04:31,154 --> 01:04:34,156
You mean you don't know?
It's too intriguing.

727
01:04:34,324 --> 01:04:37,703
Now that Fester's back,
he's king of the castle again, isn't he?

728
01:04:37,870 --> 01:04:40,288
Fester's the older brother,
so he gets it all.

729
01:04:40,455 --> 01:04:42,498
The house, the money, you name it.

730
01:04:42,666 --> 01:04:44,542
Fester's still single, isn't he?

731
01:04:44,711 --> 01:04:47,379
- Are you, Mr. Alford?
- Why, Fauna.

732
01:04:47,547 --> 01:04:50,131
- I'm Fauna.
- I'm Flora.

733
01:04:51,509 --> 01:04:54,721
I'm flattered. Excuse me, ladies.

734
01:04:59,893 --> 01:05:03,145
I can't find her anywhere.
Let's just leave.

735
01:05:03,564 --> 01:05:05,731
- Out the back.
- Now pull yourself together.

736
01:05:05,898 --> 01:05:07,650
She'll turn up, the little cockroach.

737
01:05:07,818 --> 01:05:09,694
You get to the party
or they'll suspect something.

738
01:05:09,862 --> 01:05:12,154
- I'll be down soon.
- Yes, Mother.

739
01:05:19,413 --> 01:05:22,540
Everyone, your attention, please.

740
01:05:27,047 --> 01:05:30,632
Tonight we dance
for our treasured guest of honor,

741
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:32,301
Fester Addams.

742
01:05:34,889 --> 01:05:37,891
The mamushka!

743
01:05:39,559 --> 01:05:42,562
Taught to us by our Cossack cousins,

744
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:45,647
the mamushka has been
an Addams' family tradition

745
01:05:45,815 --> 01:05:47,442
since God knows when.

746
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:50,445
We danced the mamushka
while Nero fiddled.

747
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:53,366
We danced the mamushka at Waterloo.

748
01:05:53,784 --> 01:05:57,745
We danced the mamushka
for Jack the Ripper.

749
01:05:58,413 --> 01:06:01,248
And now, Fester Addams,

750
01:06:01,792 --> 01:06:05,919
this mamushka is for you.

751
01:06:27,819 --> 01:06:32,323
- Where are you going? There's trouble.
- Hey! Not to worry. Plan B.

752
01:06:32,490 --> 01:06:34,992
- But that hideous little girl knows...
- I'm in charge.

753
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:37,203
Ten minutes, I'll be back.

754
01:07:32,678 --> 01:07:35,432
Mamushka, mamushka

755
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:37,057
He comes for his mamushka

756
01:07:37,226 --> 01:07:38,601
With a hey and a hey
and a hey and a hey

757
01:07:38,768 --> 01:07:41,855
And a hey and a hey
and a hey and a hey

758
01:07:42,023 --> 01:07:43,731
And a hey and a hey
and a hey and a hey and a...

759
01:07:44,274 --> 01:07:46,442
Wait!

760
01:07:48,571 --> 01:07:52,575
I swear by Mummy

761
01:07:52,742 --> 01:07:54,868
And Daddums

762
01:07:55,369 --> 01:07:58,206
This detestable Fester's

763
01:07:58,373 --> 01:08:01,876
The echt Fester Addams

764
01:08:03,545 --> 01:08:07,256
So hey, hey, hey, hey
hey, hey, hey, hey

765
01:08:07,424 --> 01:08:11,219
Let's dance the dance of brotherly love!

766
01:08:11,386 --> 01:08:12,762
Mamushka!

767
01:08:16,433 --> 01:08:18,894
What the hell's going on over there?

768
01:08:19,062 --> 01:08:22,481
How would you like to be rid
of the Addamses for good?

769
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:26,776
- I'm serious.
- What can I do for you?

770
01:08:28,947 --> 01:08:31,657
You are gonna love this.

771
01:08:34,577 --> 01:08:37,704
We've been married
for almost 20 years.

772
01:08:39,291 --> 01:08:41,501
Sometimes it seems like more.

773
01:08:44,463 --> 01:08:48,132
Well, people grow. People change.

774
01:08:58,979 --> 01:09:01,105
Isn't it a beautiful night?

775
01:09:05,944 --> 01:09:08,530
You'll come see me before you leave,
won't you, Fester?

776
01:09:08,698 --> 01:09:10,489
I'll call once I'm alone.

777
01:09:10,657 --> 01:09:12,742
There's your ride, girls.

778
01:09:24,714 --> 01:09:28,634
You're a marvelous dancer.
It's been such fun.

779
01:09:31,804 --> 01:09:34,515
I can't. We mustn't.

780
01:09:41,148 --> 01:09:42,189
Call me!

781
01:09:42,357 --> 01:09:44,358
Mamushka, mamushka

782
01:09:44,526 --> 01:09:46,861
I swallowed with one whoosh-ka!

783
01:09:47,029 --> 01:09:48,404
And a hey and a hey

784
01:09:48,572 --> 01:09:50,740
And a hey and a hey and a hey

785
01:09:51,367 --> 01:09:52,827
Hey, hey!

786
01:09:53,869 --> 01:09:57,039
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

787
01:09:57,206 --> 01:09:58,206
Gordon.

788
01:09:58,374 --> 01:09:59,374
Hey. Hey, hey

789
01:09:59,542 --> 01:10:00,542
Gordon, Gordon, stop it.

790
01:10:00,710 --> 01:10:01,710
Gordon, no.

791
01:10:01,878 --> 01:10:02,879
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

792
01:10:03,047 --> 01:10:04,046
Stop it, Gordon. Stop it!

793
01:10:04,213 --> 01:10:05,882
Stop it, this instant.

794
01:10:06,675 --> 01:10:09,886
- Is that lipstick all over your face?
- From the twins.

795
01:10:10,054 --> 01:10:12,805
The beauteous Amor twins.

796
01:10:12,973 --> 01:10:14,307
The twins?

797
01:10:14,475 --> 01:10:17,226
Gordon, I don't understand this.
Let me get this clear.

798
01:10:17,394 --> 01:10:21,356
- Have you been having a good time?
- Yes! I have!

799
01:10:21,523 --> 01:10:23,150
It was marvelous.

800
01:10:23,318 --> 01:10:27,153
I sang up a storm
and danced till I dropped!

801
01:10:27,404 --> 01:10:30,907
The mamushka! The mamushka!

802
01:10:31,075 --> 01:10:35,705
And a hey and a hey
and a hey and a hey and a hey

803
01:10:38,291 --> 01:10:40,793
- Mother?
- Mother? Mother? Who is that?

804
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:44,004
- I don't think I recall.
- Mother, please.

805
01:10:44,172 --> 01:10:46,634
I'm just fine. I'm dandy.

806
01:10:47,051 --> 01:10:49,552
Don't concern yourself
about me, Gordon.

807
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:52,847
Please, return to your depraved orgy.

808
01:10:53,474 --> 01:10:56,310
Sometimes I think
you're not even my son.

809
01:10:56,478 --> 01:10:59,479
- Don't say that.
- I'm just your mother.

810
01:10:59,648 --> 01:11:03,192
You only owe me
your entire existence on this planet.

811
01:11:03,652 --> 01:11:07,030
Please, Gordon, by all means,
go sing, dance, date.

812
01:11:07,197 --> 01:11:10,532
Oh, Mother, I'm so terribly sorry.

813
01:11:14,328 --> 01:11:16,873
It was just a party. It's over.

814
01:11:17,791 --> 01:11:19,418
It means nothing.

815
01:11:19,918 --> 01:11:23,255
The Siamese twins, the hunchback,
Cousin It,

816
01:11:23,882 --> 01:11:25,381
they're not you.

817
01:11:25,550 --> 01:11:28,051
Say it, Gordon. Make me believe it.

818
01:11:28,553 --> 01:11:31,888
I love you. And I want money.

819
01:11:32,557 --> 01:11:34,474
We've got to find Tully.

820
01:11:39,398 --> 01:11:41,940
Look, our little boy.

821
01:11:42,401 --> 01:11:43,901
All tuckered out.

822
01:11:44,068 --> 01:11:48,072
It's so sweet.
He looks just like a little entrÃ©e.

823
01:11:49,616 --> 01:11:52,744
- Where's the party?
- It's over, darling.

824
01:11:53,455 --> 01:11:57,250
- Have you seen your sister?
- Not since before the mamushka.

825
01:11:58,041 --> 01:11:59,209
Gomez.

826
01:11:59,878 --> 01:12:02,629
Fan out.
Pugsley, head for the dung heap.

827
01:12:02,798 --> 01:12:05,382
Mama and Morticia, the shallow graves.
I'll take the abyss.

828
01:12:05,550 --> 01:12:07,885
Lurch, check out the bottomless pit.

829
01:12:08,052 --> 01:12:09,636
- Fester?
- Up here!

830
01:12:10,222 --> 01:12:14,850
Fester, you take the ravine
and the unmarked abandoned well.

831
01:12:15,018 --> 01:12:18,980
Someone should stay behind
in case she comes back.

832
01:12:19,565 --> 01:12:21,316
Good man. Good thinking!

833
01:12:21,484 --> 01:12:23,611
Then who'll take the swamp?

834
01:12:26,948 --> 01:12:30,283
That's the spirit, Thing. Lend a hand.
Let's go!

835
01:12:37,626 --> 01:12:38,793
Gordon!

836
01:12:39,711 --> 01:12:41,252
Don't dawdle.

837
01:12:52,809 --> 01:12:55,602
- What are you doing?
- I'm relaxing.

838
01:12:56,730 --> 01:13:00,023
- Taking a little sun.
- Have you gone mad?

839
01:13:00,979 --> 01:13:02,356
On the contrary.

840
01:13:10,205 --> 01:13:11,868
Wednesday!

841
01:13:14,617 --> 01:13:16,693
Wednesday!

842
01:13:19,055 --> 01:13:20,778
Wednesday!

843
01:13:21,773 --> 01:13:23,752
Wednesday!

844
01:14:00,422 --> 01:14:03,591
- What is all this?
- This is a restraining order.

845
01:14:03,758 --> 01:14:05,426
- A restraining order?
- Yes.

846
01:14:05,594 --> 01:14:09,555
It requires you
to keep a distance of 1,000 yards

847
01:14:09,723 --> 01:14:10,723
from this house.

848
01:14:10,892 --> 01:14:13,101
I am restrained from my own house?

849
01:14:13,268 --> 01:14:15,895
Not your house, mustache.
Not anymore.

850
01:14:16,062 --> 01:14:18,564
It belongs to
the oldest living descendant,

851
01:14:18,732 --> 01:14:21,943
the elder brother, Fester Addams.

852
01:14:22,111 --> 01:14:25,237
- Fester adores Gomez.
- No, no, he's afraid of him.

853
01:14:25,405 --> 01:14:28,867
Seeing the twins brought it all back.
You're bitter rivals, Gomez.

854
01:14:29,035 --> 01:14:32,287
- I demand to speak with Fester.
- Sorry. No can do.

855
01:14:32,914 --> 01:14:35,373
He's very hurt. Just leave.

856
01:14:37,961 --> 01:14:40,253
But he isn't even Uncle Fester.

857
01:14:43,884 --> 01:14:46,928
Have no fear. Justice shall prevail.

858
01:14:47,471 --> 01:14:49,388
The courts will decide.

859
01:14:49,891 --> 01:14:53,727
They say a man who represents himself
has a fool for a client.

860
01:14:53,895 --> 01:14:56,229
Well, with God as my witness,

861
01:14:56,397 --> 01:14:58,440
I am that fool!

862
01:14:59,233 --> 01:15:03,403
Therefore, it is with no small amount
of personal satisfaction

863
01:15:03,988 --> 01:15:08,493
that I declare Fester Addams
legal executor of the Addams estate

864
01:15:08,743 --> 01:15:11,871
and rightful owner of all possessions

865
01:15:12,039 --> 01:15:16,084
and properties contained therein,
with one exception.

866
01:15:16,251 --> 01:15:18,045
Gomez Addams,

867
01:15:18,587 --> 01:15:22,465
I believe these are yours.

868
01:17:01,487 --> 01:17:04,823
- You are doing this on purpose.
- That's right, Mother. Isn't this fun?

869
01:17:04,991 --> 01:17:06,741
I'll race you back.

870
01:17:08,745 --> 01:17:11,331
Yes, we've been forced from our home.

871
01:17:11,957 --> 01:17:15,085
Yes, we've been betrayed
by those we trusted,

872
01:17:15,544 --> 01:17:18,963
but we are Addamses,
and we will not submit.

873
01:17:20,633 --> 01:17:23,885
Who recalls the fable
of The Tortoise and the Hare?

874
01:17:24,261 --> 01:17:27,472
The swift yet lazy little cottontail

875
01:17:27,641 --> 01:17:30,266
and his slow
but determined companion?

876
01:17:30,935 --> 01:17:32,561
What does this story teach us?

877
01:17:32,729 --> 01:17:35,523
Kill the hare! Skin it. Boil it.

878
01:17:35,690 --> 01:17:38,442
- Put the tortoise on the highway.
- During rush hour.

879
01:17:38,610 --> 01:17:41,529
Yes. We will survive.

880
01:17:42,239 --> 01:17:45,908
Poison us. Strangle us.
Break our bones.

881
01:17:46,077 --> 01:17:48,161
We will come back for more.

882
01:17:48,955 --> 01:17:50,329
And why?

883
01:17:50,497 --> 01:17:53,917
- Because we like it.
- Because we're Addamses.

884
01:17:54,085 --> 01:17:55,627
We're Addamses.

885
01:18:03,511 --> 01:18:05,555
Here, Lurch. On the house.

886
01:18:23,282 --> 01:18:26,742
We have so many homemakers
re-entering the workforce.

887
01:18:26,911 --> 01:18:29,746
Your domestic skills
can be very valuable.

888
01:18:29,913 --> 01:18:32,584
- College?
- Private tutors.

889
01:18:33,584 --> 01:18:35,752
- Major?
- Spells and hexes.

890
01:18:36,921 --> 01:18:38,423
Liberal Arts.

891
01:18:39,215 --> 01:18:42,594
What about your husband?
Is he currently employed?

892
01:18:43,846 --> 01:18:46,555
He's going through a bad patch
at the moment,

893
01:18:46,723 --> 01:18:48,224
but it's not his fault.

894
01:18:48,392 --> 01:18:49,892
Of course not.

895
01:18:51,061 --> 01:18:53,605
What is he, a loafer?
A hopeless layabout?

896
01:18:53,772 --> 01:18:55,565
A shiftless dreamer?

897
01:18:57,735 --> 01:18:59,195
Not anymore.

898
01:19:05,076 --> 01:19:07,912
- Is this made from real lemons?
- Yes.

899
01:19:08,246 --> 01:19:10,915
I only like all-natural
fruits and beverages

900
01:19:11,082 --> 01:19:13,876
organically grown with no preservatives.

901
01:19:14,211 --> 01:19:17,254
- Are you sure they're real lemons?
- Yes.

902
01:19:17,714 --> 01:19:19,758
Well, I'll tell you what.

903
01:19:19,926 --> 01:19:21,051
I'll buy a cup

904
01:19:21,219 --> 01:19:24,220
if you buy a box
of my delicious Girl Scout cookies.

905
01:19:24,387 --> 01:19:25,805
Do we have a deal?

906
01:19:25,973 --> 01:19:28,516
Are they made from real Girl Scouts?

907
01:19:40,780 --> 01:19:43,200
And so,
the witch lured Hansel and Gretel

908
01:19:43,368 --> 01:19:46,994
into the candy house
by promising them more sweets.

909
01:19:47,246 --> 01:19:49,538
And she told them to look in the oven.

910
01:19:49,706 --> 01:19:53,418
And she was about to push them in
when, lo and behold,

911
01:19:53,794 --> 01:19:56,880
Hansel pushed the poor,
defenseless witch

912
01:19:57,047 --> 01:20:00,758
into the oven instead,
where she was burned alive,

913
01:20:00,926 --> 01:20:02,594
writhing in agony.

914
01:20:05,807 --> 01:20:10,103
Now, boys and girls,
what do you think that feels like?

915
01:21:04,035 --> 01:21:05,702
Welcome to the show.

916
01:21:05,870 --> 01:21:07,537
Voodoo witch doctors
here in the United States.

917
01:21:07,705 --> 01:21:08,706
Here, kitty, kitty.

918
01:21:08,874 --> 01:21:13,252
Do they really exist
or is this just tabloid hooey?

919
01:21:13,420 --> 01:21:15,504
We'd love you to call in
with your comments.

920
01:21:18,258 --> 01:21:20,510
After lunch, we'll try again.

921
01:21:22,012 --> 01:21:23,430
Yes, Mother.

922
01:21:27,226 --> 01:21:29,227
We'll find the money.

923
01:21:30,021 --> 01:21:33,190
Meanwhile, we have this little nest,
quiet and cozy

924
01:21:33,358 --> 01:21:35,817
without that dreadful family.

925
01:21:37,237 --> 01:21:38,653
Yes, Mother.

926
01:21:39,322 --> 01:21:42,158
So, you claim that your son
was brainwashed

927
01:21:42,326 --> 01:21:46,162
by voodoo witch doctors
and forced to recruit others.

928
01:21:46,747 --> 01:21:47,830
Let's take a call.

929
01:21:47,998 --> 01:21:49,415
Hello, Sally.

930
01:21:49,583 --> 01:21:52,168
Mr. Addams, please stop calling.

931
01:21:52,669 --> 01:21:54,503
We do not know where they meet.

932
01:21:54,670 --> 01:21:56,673
Let's take another call.

933
01:21:58,342 --> 01:22:01,094
Gomez, why don't we go for a drive?

934
01:22:01,595 --> 01:22:03,680
- The whole family.
- A drive?

935
01:22:04,682 --> 01:22:07,726
- And miss Gilligan?
- Dinner's gonna be late.

936
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:10,521
Here, boy. Here, boy.

937
01:22:18,780 --> 01:22:19,989
Gordon.

938
01:22:21,157 --> 01:22:22,408
Gordon!

939
01:23:29,731 --> 01:23:32,523
I would like to
speak with Fester, please.

940
01:23:41,368 --> 01:23:45,412
You're a desperate woman
consumed by greed and bitterness.

941
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:49,249
- We could have been such friends.
- Gordon, let's get started.

942
01:23:49,417 --> 01:23:50,919
- But, Mother...
- Stop stalling.

943
01:23:51,086 --> 01:23:53,880
I'm not stalling. Stop badgering me.

944
01:23:56,258 --> 01:24:00,094
- The vault, Mrs. Addams, any thoughts?
- None whatsoever.

945
01:24:00,262 --> 01:24:02,388
Tully, take over. Tighten it.

946
01:24:02,556 --> 01:24:04,265
But I got this stomach thing
when I torture people.

947
01:24:04,433 --> 01:24:05,600
Do it.

948
01:24:09,064 --> 01:24:10,230
Again.

949
01:24:18,990 --> 01:24:20,324
Tighter.

950
01:24:24,497 --> 01:24:26,497
You've done this before.

951
01:25:13,882 --> 01:25:17,009
Who is it?
We're paid through Thursday.

952
01:25:18,137 --> 01:25:19,846
Morticia.

953
01:25:20,305 --> 01:25:23,516
Morticia. Morticia what?

954
01:25:24,268 --> 01:25:27,312
Slow down!
It's terrible when you stutter.

955
01:25:40,660 --> 01:25:44,913
Morticia in danger.

956
01:25:45,499 --> 01:25:46,665
Stop.

957
01:25:46,834 --> 01:25:50,920
Send help at once. Stop!

958
01:25:53,590 --> 01:25:56,259
You can't! Not with red-hot pokers!

959
01:25:57,178 --> 01:25:59,804
- Is this gonna smell?
- Tully Alford,

960
01:25:59,972 --> 01:26:03,349
charlatan, deadbeat, parasite.

961
01:26:04,435 --> 01:26:06,436
How Gomez adored you.

962
01:26:06,604 --> 01:26:08,938
Well, not enough.

963
01:26:09,899 --> 01:26:13,027
Morticia, please.

964
01:26:13,195 --> 01:26:16,906
And dear Fester, which is the real you?

965
01:26:17,699 --> 01:26:20,785
The loathsome,
underhanded monster you've become

966
01:26:21,244 --> 01:26:24,706
or the loathsome, underhanded monster
we came to love?

967
01:26:24,916 --> 01:26:26,123
Don't ask me.

968
01:26:43,810 --> 01:26:46,144
I know what you're feeling, Fester.

969
01:26:46,313 --> 01:26:47,562
Gordon!

970
01:26:48,816 --> 01:26:52,235
Gordon, I have a thought.
Just a notion, top of my head.

971
01:26:52,403 --> 01:26:54,237
Tell me what you think?

972
01:26:54,405 --> 01:26:57,907
Since you and Mrs. Addams
are so very close,

973
01:26:59,618 --> 01:27:01,245
be my guest.

974
01:27:03,956 --> 01:27:05,249
Addams!

975
01:27:07,585 --> 01:27:09,461
Darling, take care.

976
01:27:10,380 --> 01:27:13,215
Dirty pool, old man. Never again!

977
01:27:24,395 --> 01:27:26,062
One for you, Tully.

978
01:27:26,980 --> 01:27:28,314
And now...

979
01:27:38,368 --> 01:27:39,702
One for me.

980
01:27:39,869 --> 01:27:42,621
- Gomez, I'm on retainer.
- Let him up.

981
01:27:52,674 --> 01:27:55,510
That's right. Now get moving, Addams.

982
01:27:59,015 --> 01:28:00,891
Take him to the vault,

983
01:28:01,726 --> 01:28:04,269
and if you're not back in one hour,

984
01:28:05,062 --> 01:28:06,938
I displace her.

985
01:28:11,527 --> 01:28:14,404
Tish, seeing you like this,

986
01:28:14,572 --> 01:28:16,073
my blood boils.

987
01:28:16,241 --> 01:28:17,742
As does mine.

988
01:28:18,744 --> 01:28:21,746
- This wheel of pain.
- Our wheel.

989
01:28:21,914 --> 01:28:25,082
To live without you,
only that would be torture.

990
01:28:25,667 --> 01:28:29,171
A day alone, only that would be death.

991
01:28:31,507 --> 01:28:32,925
Knock it off.

992
01:28:34,761 --> 01:28:36,928
The vault, Addams, right now.

993
01:28:46,898 --> 01:28:49,692
- But, Mother, can't we...
- Can it, Gordon.

994
01:28:49,860 --> 01:28:53,196
Stop dragging your feet.
You disgust me!

995
01:28:53,905 --> 01:28:56,325
You're nothing
but a useless, sniveling baby.

996
01:28:56,493 --> 01:28:58,409
A stone around my neck.

997
01:28:58,744 --> 01:29:00,662
What was I thinking?

998
01:29:00,830 --> 01:29:02,580
I should have left you
where I found you.

999
01:29:03,874 --> 01:29:06,377
No tricks, Gomez!

1000
01:29:07,337 --> 01:29:09,338
That's the wrong book.

1001
01:29:18,598 --> 01:29:20,015
Allow me.

1002
01:29:22,812 --> 01:29:24,520
Good show, old man.

1003
01:29:27,274 --> 01:29:30,943
Put that book down, Gordon.
You don't know what it can do.

1004
01:29:31,779 --> 01:29:35,156
- It's not just literature.
- Oh, really?

1005
01:29:37,159 --> 01:29:38,243
Quickly, darling.

1006
01:29:38,411 --> 01:29:40,412
Gordon, I'm your friend.

1007
01:29:40,830 --> 01:29:44,750
- Think of the doubloons.
- They're not yours, Tully.

1008
01:29:45,419 --> 01:29:46,419
Back off!

1009
01:29:46,587 --> 01:29:49,505
Leather straps. Red-hot pokers.

1010
01:29:50,133 --> 01:29:51,506
Later, my dearest.

1011
01:29:51,674 --> 01:29:54,510
Keep the book closed, Gordon.
Listen to Mother.

1012
01:29:54,678 --> 01:29:58,472
I'll never listen to you,
never ever again.

1013
01:29:58,640 --> 01:30:01,934
I had to be strict with you
because I cared. Put it down!

1014
01:30:02,102 --> 01:30:04,437
You never really loved me.

1015
01:30:04,856 --> 01:30:05,939
Fester, this way!

1016
01:30:06,107 --> 01:30:07,607
Stop whining,
you little good-for-nothing.

1017
01:30:07,774 --> 01:30:09,192
Be a man!

1018
01:30:09,694 --> 01:30:12,779
You were a terrible mother!

1019
01:30:13,364 --> 01:30:15,616
There! I said it.

1020
01:31:06,921 --> 01:31:08,421
Are they dead?

1021
01:31:08,798 --> 01:31:10,424
Does it matter?

1022
01:31:28,403 --> 01:31:30,111
Trick or...

1023
01:31:34,950 --> 01:31:36,410
Here we come!

1024
01:31:37,120 --> 01:31:39,663
- Pugsley, old man.
- Why, look at you.

1025
01:31:44,211 --> 01:31:45,627
How do you like it?

1026
01:31:47,423 --> 01:31:50,465
What can I say?
He's gonna break hearts.

1027
01:31:50,634 --> 01:31:52,217
Trick or treat.

1028
01:31:54,555 --> 01:31:56,806
Hello, Margaret. Cousin It.

1029
01:31:56,974 --> 01:32:00,269
- I almost didn't recognize you.
- Isn't he handsome?

1030
01:32:00,729 --> 01:32:03,856
Everyone keeps asking
where he bought his costume.

1031
01:32:04,024 --> 01:32:05,607
It is a wonderful hat.

1032
01:32:06,817 --> 01:32:09,778
What are you, darling?
Where's your costume?

1033
01:32:09,946 --> 01:32:12,447
This is my costume.
I'm a homicidal maniac.

1034
01:32:12,614 --> 01:32:14,992
They look just like everyone else.

1035
01:32:19,539 --> 01:32:22,916
I'm so glad
I can spend this night with my family,

1036
01:32:23,084 --> 01:32:24,960
now that I've got my memory back.

1037
01:32:25,128 --> 01:32:29,298
Thank God for that lightning.
Knocked some sense into you.

1038
01:32:32,428 --> 01:32:33,970
You remember, old man.

1039
01:32:34,138 --> 01:32:36,389
Dr. Pinder-Schloss
really did find Fester

1040
01:32:36,557 --> 01:32:39,225
tangled in a tuna net 25 years ago,

1041
01:32:39,769 --> 01:32:41,228
with amnesia.

1042
01:32:41,396 --> 01:32:43,439
From the Bermuda Triangle.

1043
01:32:46,818 --> 01:32:49,653
How true.
Stranger things have happened.

1044
01:32:49,821 --> 01:32:51,613
Please, Uncle Fester.

1045
01:32:52,449 --> 01:32:54,785
- Pugsley.
- For the picture.

1046
01:33:01,917 --> 01:33:05,253
All right, everybody, time for a game.

1047
01:33:05,588 --> 01:33:08,422
What shall it be? Bobbing for apples?

1048
01:33:08,591 --> 01:33:09,716
Charades?

1049
01:33:11,053 --> 01:33:13,512
Of course. Wake the dead.

1050
01:33:13,679 --> 01:33:17,057
- Wake the dead!
- Wake the dead!

1051
01:33:17,642 --> 01:33:19,518
Out to the cemetery!
Come on, everyone.

1052
01:33:19,685 --> 01:33:21,563
I've never played this before.

1053
01:33:21,731 --> 01:33:23,815
- How does it go?
- Did you bring a shovel?

1054
01:33:23,982 --> 01:33:26,901
- Uncle Fester, will you be on my team?
- No, mine.

1055
01:33:27,069 --> 01:33:28,735
I tell you what.
We'll give you a head start.

1056
01:33:28,903 --> 01:33:31,532
Three skulls and a pelvis. How is that?

1057
01:33:34,619 --> 01:33:37,371
My own dear brother.

1058
01:33:46,881 --> 01:33:49,216
- Come on.
- We'll catch up.

1059
01:33:52,929 --> 01:33:55,556
Wake the dead! Wake the dead!

1060
01:33:56,892 --> 01:33:58,768
Uncle Atlas, wake up.

1061
01:34:00,354 --> 01:34:03,731
- Come on, Aunt LaBorgia, wake up.
- No, no, no, children.

1062
01:34:03,899 --> 01:34:07,235
You have to dig. That's half the fun.

1063
01:34:18,747 --> 01:34:21,084
Oh, Tish, what more could we ask?

1064
01:34:23,670 --> 01:34:25,046
Gomez.

1065
01:34:31,095 --> 01:34:34,264
Cara mia, is it true?

1066
01:34:34,932 --> 01:34:36,016
Oui.

1067
01:34:36,601 --> 01:34:37,894
Mon amour.

1068
01:34:49,114 --> 01:34:51,407
Wake up, Grandpa Addams.
It's Halloween.

1069
01:34:51,575 --> 01:34:54,035
Children, look!
Great-Aunt Lavinia!

1070
01:34:54,404 --> 01:34:56,967
She was beheaded by
her own children!

1071
01:34:57,374 --> 01:34:59,116
Yay!

1072
01:35:00,305 --> 01:36:00,934
