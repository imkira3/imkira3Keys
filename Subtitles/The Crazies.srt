Nicholas, what happened?

179
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:20,817
It's Dad.

Wh-Where's Dad?

What happened?

182
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:26,657
Honey, please, talk to me.

Please.

Get me some power.

When we got here, there was
an empty gas can just sitting out front.

- Russ?
- Uh, yeah.

by the looks of things.

Do that.

00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:04,559
Boys, last I checked,
hunting season ended three months ago.

253
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,770
We was just out taking in a little nature.

- Fresh air is all.
- Guns away till fall.

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,733
- Aw, come on, Sheriff.
- What, are you kidding me?

256
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:14,361
- What's with this guy?
- Well, we got us a pilot.

257
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:16,822
Where's the plane?

258
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:19,324
You know, last week,
Travis Quinn was going around

259
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:22,118
saying he heard something crash
out by Hautman Bog.

260
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:25,163
- I didn't think nothing of it.
- On account of him being full of shit?

261
00:19:25,248 --> 00:19:27,165
As a general rule.

262
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,710
- Well, maybe there's the exception.
- Maybe.

263
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:40,637
[Russ]
You said it sounded like a plane, Trav?

264
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,305
Sheriff, about the reward...

265
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,641
Shit. Big plane? Little plane?
What? Come on now.

266
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,643
If you can explain the difference
how those two sound,

267
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,895
- I might be able to figure it out.
- You're full of shit.

268
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,647
He's full of shit.

269
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:53,316
People only ask for a reward
when there's something to find.

270
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:54,818
Is it gonna be a big reward, Sheriff?

271
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,319
Travis, you ask about that again,

272
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:58,154
I'm gonna throw you
out of the fucking boat.

273
00:19:58,239 --> 00:20:00,240
You're not gonna shoot me?

274
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:03,493
Travis.

275
00:20:03,578 --> 00:20:05,495
Yeah?

276
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,206
Kill the engine.

[engine stops]

278
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:14,337
It was a big plane, Russ.

279
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:16,006
Why is that?

280
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:18,341
'Cause we're right on top of it.

[radio chatter]

282
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:51,541
Kevin, which way does
the water flow through town?

283
00:20:51,626 --> 00:20:53,335
Nice to see you, too, Dave.

284
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,086
Waste water or drinking?

285
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:57,422
- Drinking.
- Give me a second.

286
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,134
A plane that size goes down...

287
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:03,345
nothing in the paper,
nothing in the news.

288
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:06,264
- Make any sense to you?
- It depends on what the payload is.

289
00:21:06,349 --> 00:21:08,224
Exactly what I'm thinking.

290
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:10,477
Which is what?

291
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:12,896
Hautman Bog...
What's that drain into?

292
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,564
- Dwyer Creek.
- Which drains into?

293
00:21:14,649 --> 00:21:16,816
Black Pond. Oh, hey,
you remember monster catfish...

294
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:20,153
Russell, where do you think
we get our drinking water from?

295
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:23,365
Treated water comes in from the north,
breaks east-west.

296
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:25,075
And what house does it get to first?

297
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:27,744
Uh, let's see.

298
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,746
Rory Hamill.

299
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:41,299
You wanna shut off
the entire town's water supply on a hunch?

300
00:21:41,384 --> 00:21:44,928
Mayor, I've got three dead bodies
in the morgue in the last 48 hours.

301
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:47,138
David, take a look around you.

302
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:48,974
This is a farming community.

303
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:50,976
It is springtime.
It is planting season.

304
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,936
You turn off the water,
you're gonna kill the crops.

305
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:56,606
You kill the crops, and you bankrupt
every family in Pierce County.

306
00:21:56,691 --> 00:21:59,734
And that is not based
on some, uh, hunch.

307
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:01,319
That's a fact.

308
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:05,657
Water stays on.

309
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:20,964
Uh, Sheriff,

310
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:22,632
I'm all for a little civil disobedience,

311
00:22:22,717 --> 00:22:26,386
but, um, I think this one
might cost you your job.

312
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:31,057
You know what, Russ?

313
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:36,354
That wouldn't be such a bad thing.

314
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:50,577
What the fuck?

315
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:02,088
Shh. Hang on a second.

316
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,594
Well, is he dead?

317
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:13,349
Well, if he is, he won't mind waiting.

Oh! Jesus Christ!

320
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:25,612
Did we or did we not request
a transfer for him this morning?

321
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,696

How'd you get out?

David, Judy was still inside.

- I'm sorry.
- She's not sick.

507
00:37:02,596 --> 00:37:05,806
She's been running a fever all month.
Russ, she's pregnant.

508
00:37:05,891 --> 00:37:07,057
It's about time.

509
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:09,101
I'm gonna go get her.

510
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:11,937

Is that you?

515
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:42,551
Oh, God. Honey...

516
00:37:42,636 --> 00:37:45,387
Honey, are you hurt?

517
00:37:45,472 --> 00:37:47,598
Is this really happening?

518
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:51,310
It's gonna be all right.
We're gonna be okay.

519

- Did Peter call?
- [Russell] That's gonna be me.

Russell, we've got enough problems
without you inventing them.

- That's easy for you to say.
- Did Peter call?

You're at the end of the pot mine.

I'm a half mile from the farm.

- Who's the sheriff?
- What?

Who's the sheriff of Pierce County?

- You are.
- I am. Who's the deputy?

- That would be me.
- You are.

575
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:09,484
Deputy does what the sheriff tells him.

576
00:42:09,569 --> 00:42:12,863
That's the balance of power.
And I'm telling you,

00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:15,782
you're not getting sick,
you understand me?

Fuck.

Aw, shit!
It's booted.

- They all are.
- I'll check those cars.

00:45:43,616 --> 00:45:46,368
It's a hell of a walk to Quik Phil's.

629
00:45:48,037 --> 00:45:49,955
I got the old cruiser on blocks.

630
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:52,040
That piece of shit still works?

631
00:45:52,125 --> 00:45:53,542
Yeah.

632
00:45:53,626 --> 00:45:56,086
I guess you can't boot a car without wheels.

633
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:58,046
It's seven miles to my place.

634
00:45:58,131 --> 00:45:59,881
It's five if we cut through
the McGregor farm.

635
00:45:59,966 --> 00:46:02,426
Another 20 to Quik Phil's from there.

636
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:05,262
- I'm fine.
- Good.

[Judy]
They took my blood.

639
00:46:18,651 --> 00:46:21,820
Ran at least one test that I saw.

640
00:46:23,823 --> 00:46:26,575
What if the reason they didn't let me go
is because I have it?

641
00:46:26,659 --> 00:46:29,578
You're pregnant.
That's why you have a fever.

642
00:46:29,662 --> 00:46:33,248
David, you can't know that for sure.

643
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:36,084
I can, and I do.

644
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:40,547
If you're sick, I'm sick.
We drank from the same tap.

645
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:43,633
And I'm not sick.
None of us are.

646
00:46:48,431 --> 00:46:50,348
We are gonna get through this.

647
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:58,815
What the fuck?

648
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:01,651
Scotty McGregor.
It's her boyfriend.

649
00:47:01,736 --> 00:47:02,944
Russell, stop her.

650
00:47:03,029 --> 00:47:03,945
- Yeah, I got it.
- David...

651
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:06,239
We don't have time for this.

652
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:08,366
You had time for me.

653
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:16,208
[whispers]
Okay, let's go.

[Becca]
Scotty?

656
00:47:26,636 --> 00:47:28,053
- Scotty?
- Get back!

657
00:47:28,137 --> 00:47:30,722
- Drop the fucking gun, Scotty.
- I will blow your head off.

658
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:33,141
- Scotty, it's me.
- Stay here.

659
00:47:33,226 --> 00:47:37,187
Scotty, don't be an asshole.
We're fine.

660
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:41,149
Scotty.

661

[Russell]
Scotty, put the gun down.

662
00:47:43,236 --> 00:47:44,653
Put it down.

663
00:47:44,737 --> 00:47:46,404
Scotty.

664
00:47:56,916 --> 00:47:58,500
Sorry.

666
00:48:00,253 --> 00:48:02,254
Had to be sure.

667
00:48:02,338 --> 00:48:06,466
Yeah, well, that's
a two-way street there, Scotty.

668
00:48:09,095 --> 00:48:12,180
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

669
00:48:12,265 --> 00:48:13,974
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

670
00:48:14,058 --> 00:48:16,059
- Scotty, where's your mom?
- Back at the house.

671
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:18,103
We were just getting some supplies
before we started walking.

672
00:48:18,187 --> 00:48:20,689
The sheriff's got a car.
You two can come with us.

673
00:48:20,773 --> 00:48:23,441
- Are you okay?
- Better than you guys.

674
00:48:23,526 --> 00:48:26,319
- How's your mom?
- Be quiet.

675
00:48:26,404 --> 00:48:29,155

00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:16,244

- [Woman] Stop! Stop!

682
00:49:16,329 --> 00:49:17,621
[Man]
We need you downstairs.

683
00:49:17,705 --> 00:49:19,372

- Wait.

Okay, let's go! Split it up!

I want a complete sweep of the area!

700
00:50:03,209 --> 00:50:04,959
Take my gun.
Close the back of the barn.

Oh, fuck.

How could you do it?
How could you...

708
00:50:43,499 --> 00:50:45,417
- Becca...
- You make a sound louder than this,

709
00:50:45,501 --> 00:50:47,168
and I'll kill you, you understand?

710

- Orders, sir.

- Bullshit!
- What the fuck is going on here?

713
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:55,093
All's they said is that there'd been
some sort of accident.

714
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:57,846
My whole unit got flown in.

Is that what they told you...

719
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:13,945
If you took your mask off,
you were gonna die?

720
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:17,198
They just said to keep it on.

Look, um,

I know I don't deserve
any favors from you people,

but if you let me go,
I swear to God I won't say nothing.

724
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:28,793
I didn't sign up
to shoot unarmed civilians.

725
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:32,213
- I'll just leave, okay?
- Sit down.

726
00:51:32,298 --> 00:51:34,090
- Put the gun down, Russ.
- Chief...

727

I'm a sheriff.
That's my deputy.

She's pregnant.

- [Russ] When he blabs, they'll find us.

730
00:51:44,018 --> 00:51:46,102
If we don't let him go,
they'll find us for sure.

731
00:51:46,187 --> 00:51:49,314
And besides,
he's not gonna blab.

732
00:51:50,566 --> 00:51:52,192
No, sir.

Shit.

736
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:07,749
I'm sorry about your folks' town.

- Hey, one up!
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

00:52:10,294 --> 00:52:12,170
Any crazies back there, Babcock?

Babcock?

740
00:52:17,927 --> 00:52:19,594
No. We're all clear.

00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:21,971
Good. Military's pulling
back to the perimeter.

is dead.

This town is dead,
and it's not coming back.

It's never coming back.

00:59:39,451 --> 00:59:41,369
You don't know that.

818
00:59:41,453 --> 00:59:42,620
- You saw what he did.
- Hey, guys.

819
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:45,122
Come on. We gotta go.

820
00:59:48,085 --> 00:59:50,002
He saved our lives.

821
00:59:50,087 --> 00:59:52,088
That's what I saw.

822
01:00:20,826 --> 01:00:22,743
[coughing]

823
01:00:22,828 --> 01:00:24,412

[coughing continues]

827
01:00:39,511 --> 01:00:41,137
Hey, you feeling okay?

828
01:00:41,221 --> 01:00:43,556
- She's fine. - Well, I'm
just saying, if she's getting sick,

829
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:46,225
...we don't wanna be in the fucking
car with her. - Russell, she's fine.

830
01:00:46,310 --> 01:00:47,768
I'm not sick.

831
01:00:47,853 --> 01:00:50,771
You wouldn't know,
'cause that'd be the sickness

832
01:00:50,856 --> 01:00:53,024
...messing with your mind.
- [David] Okay. Russell, that's enough.

833
01:00:53,108 --> 01:00:55,776
Don't lose your head.

834
01:00:55,861 --> 01:00:58,279
What do you mean by that?

835
01:00:58,363 --> 01:01:00,364
I mean, don't lose your head.

836
01:01:00,449 --> 01:01:01,991
What do you mean by that, Chief?

837
01:01:02,075 --> 01:01:03,868
I mean...

838
01:01:03,952 --> 01:01:05,828
She's fine.

839
01:01:07,539 --> 01:01:08,873
Now, just...

840
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:14,086
Fuck!

841
01:01:15,547 --> 01:01:18,466
- Did he see us?
- I don't know.

842
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:22,303
- David, honey...
- Aw, shit.

843
01:01:22,387 --> 01:01:24,096
Guys, it's turning around.

844
01:01:24,181 --> 01:01:25,306
- It's coming back for us!
- Shit! Let's go!

845
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:28,392
We gotta get out of here!

846
01:01:28,477 --> 01:01:31,270
- [Russell] Go! Chief, let's go!
- The helicopter's coming!

847
01:01:44,576 --> 01:01:46,911
[helicopter approaching]

848

[helicopter departing]

849
01:01:54,086 --> 01:01:55,920
- We can't stay on the highway.
- No.

850
01:01:56,004 --> 01:01:57,588
There's gotta be another road we can take.

851
01:01:57,672 --> 01:02:00,216
- What road? Tell me?
- I don't know. There's gotta be something.

852
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:02,176
- What road can they not see? Tell me.
- What?

853
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:04,178
What road can they not see?

854
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:05,846
What magic road can they not see?

855
01:02:05,931 --> 01:02:08,224
Tell me, and I'll fucking go.

856
01:02:08,308 --> 01:02:11,435
David, I'm just trying to help.

857
01:02:13,855 --> 01:02:16,565
I'm sorry.

858

[screams]

859
01:02:18,276 --> 01:02:20,736
- I saw someone.
- Move. Where?

860
01:02:20,821 --> 01:02:23,697
He was back there.
I know I saw someone.

861
01:02:23,782 --> 01:02:25,699
Uh...

862
01:02:25,784 --> 01:02:29,120
- Oh, fuck.
- Shit.

863
01:02:30,664 --> 01:02:32,081
What the fuck?

864
01:02:33,917 --> 01:02:35,251
[Judy]
David, get us outta here.

865

- Oh, shit.

866
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:42,883
- Start the car.

Come on, Chief.

[cranking continues]

869
01:02:45,637 --> 01:02:47,388

[Russell]
Come on! Let's go!

879
01:03:11,079 --> 01:03:13,080
- Why aren't we moving?
- Why the fuck aren't we moving, Chief?

880
01:03:13,165 --> 01:03:15,833
- 'Cause I can't get any fucking traction.
- Go! Go!

881
01:03:15,917 --> 01:03:18,085
Fuck! Let's go!
Get us outta here! Come on!

[Becca screaming]

I don't wanna die like this!

884
01:03:22,174 --> 01:03:24,049
[Russell]
What the fuck was that?

885
01:03:27,512 --> 01:03:29,972
- There! There! Right there!
- Motherfucker!

[gunshots]
Motherfucker!

You're okay.

[Russell]
That's my truck.

We need water.

921
01:06:55,887 --> 01:06:57,304
I know.

922
01:06:57,389 --> 01:07:00,391
[Russell]
Guys, car coming!

923
01:07:10,235 --> 01:07:12,069
Stay here.

924
01:07:12,153 --> 01:07:14,029
David, what are you doing?

925
01:07:14,114 --> 01:07:16,365
We're taking this car.

926
01:07:30,171 --> 01:07:32,506
- Motherfucker!
- Russ!

927

- [tires screeching]
- Whoo!

929
01:08:00,368 --> 01:08:04,037
Welcome to Pierce County,
friendliest place on earth, asshole.

930
01:08:04,122 --> 01:08:06,081
- Russ, I wanna talk to him.
- [coughs]

931
01:08:07,709 --> 01:08:09,585
Okay.

932
01:08:09,669 --> 01:08:11,879
Who the fuck do you think you are?

933
01:08:11,963 --> 01:08:15,215
- I'm the guy standing between
you and a bullet. - [groans]

934
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:18,177
Now, what was on that plane?

935
01:08:18,261 --> 01:08:21,180
What was on that goddamn plane?

936
01:08:21,264 --> 01:08:22,681
Trixie.

937
01:08:22,766 --> 01:08:25,100
Rhabdoveridae prototype.

938
01:08:25,185 --> 01:08:27,227
A... A fucking biological weapon.
- It was headed

939
01:08:27,312 --> 01:08:30,063
...to an incinerator in Texas.
- Whoa. What is this?

940
01:08:30,148 --> 01:08:32,733
You're telling me that you guys
engineered this crap?

941
01:08:32,817 --> 01:08:35,402
It's designed to destabilize a population.

942
01:08:35,487 --> 01:08:37,571
In this case, the wrong one.

943
01:08:37,655 --> 01:08:39,198
Look, fella, we lost a plane.

944
01:08:39,282 --> 01:08:41,408
What do you want me to say?

945
01:08:44,162 --> 01:08:46,872
How about, "Sorry for destroying
your whole goddamn town"?

946
01:08:46,998 --> 01:08:49,416
- What would you have preferred,
a global pandemic? - Wait. Wait.

947
01:08:49,501 --> 01:08:52,211
Take it up with the pilot.
I came here to help.

948
01:08:52,295 --> 01:08:54,129
Help who? Help us?

949
01:08:54,214 --> 01:08:56,256
What... What is the incubation period?

950
01:08:56,341 --> 01:08:58,258
48 hours.

951
01:08:58,343 --> 01:09:00,761
After that, you're either dead
or you don't have it.

952
01:09:00,845 --> 01:09:03,972
Fine. It's day three,
and we're still talking.

953
01:09:04,057 --> 01:09:05,808
So you are gonna help us.

954
01:09:05,892 --> 01:09:07,017
[gunshot]

955
01:09:08,436 --> 01:09:09,853
What the fuck!

956
01:09:09,938 --> 01:09:11,522
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
- Oh, my God!

957
01:09:11,606 --> 01:09:13,482
What the fuck is the matter with you?

958
01:09:13,566 --> 01:09:15,651
I said that I wanted to talk to him!

959
01:09:17,195 --> 01:09:18,487
You talked.

960
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:49,017
Shit.

961
01:09:54,399 --> 01:09:56,441
I'm gonna need that back.

962
01:09:56,526 --> 01:09:57,943
[David]
I'll carry it for a while.

963
01:09:58,027 --> 01:10:00,571
- You've been carrying it the whole time.
- Oh, no. Really.

964
01:10:00,655 --> 01:10:02,281
I got it.

965
01:10:02,365 --> 01:10:04,700
You sure?

966
01:10:04,784 --> 01:10:06,118
Yeah.

967
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,207
[gun cocks]

968
01:10:19,507 --> 01:10:21,508
Russell, we're on your side.

969
01:10:21,593 --> 01:10:23,886
My side? Shit.
I didn't even know there were sides.

970
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:26,013
- There's not. I'm just...
- Shut up the fuck up!

971
01:10:26,097 --> 01:10:28,265
- Tell her to shut up,
or I'll kill her, too. - Russell, no!

972
01:10:28,349 --> 01:10:30,559
- Judy, stop talking.
- Okay.

973
01:10:30,643 --> 01:10:32,561
Let him think about what he's doing.

974
01:10:32,645 --> 01:10:34,438
Uh-huh.

975
01:10:36,524 --> 01:10:40,444
One, two,

976
01:10:40,528 --> 01:10:42,321
three.

977
01:10:44,574 --> 01:10:47,576
That's how many times
I've saved your life.

978
01:10:49,454 --> 01:10:50,746
Go on.

A massive fire in Ogden Marsh
continues to rage,

1200
01:34:21,323 --> 01:34:23,157
and high winds are preventing fire teams

1201
01:34:23,241 --> 01:34:25,034
from containing the deadly blaze.

1202
01:34:25,118 --> 01:34:28,287
Now, information is still coming in,
but what we currently know:

1203
01:34:28,371 --> 01:34:32,207
An explosion rocked the Dakon Petrol
chemical plant early this morning,

1204
01:34:32,292 --> 01:34:36,462
with eyewitness reports
of a 400-foot fireball that lit up the sky.

1205
01:34:36,546 --> 01:34:38,714
We also have reports
of a second explosion

1206
01:34:38,798 --> 01:34:40,924
at a nearby truck fueling station.

1207
01:34:41,009 --> 01:34:44,178
A perimeter has been set
in an effort to contain the blaze,

1208
01:34:44,262 --> 01:34:46,013
and civilians are not being permitted
into that area.
