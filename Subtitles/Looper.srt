1
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:44,103
Time travel has not yet been invented.

2
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:47,398
But 30 years from now,
it will have been.

3
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:52,361
It will be instantly outlawed...

4
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:57,408
...used only in secret
by the largest criminal organizations.

5
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:11,798
It's nearly impossible
to dispose of a body in the future.

6
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:15,426
l'm told. Tagging techniques, whatnot.

7
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:19,597
So when these criminal organizations
in the future need someone gone...

8
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:25,019
...they use specialized assassins
in our present called loopers.

9
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,522
And so...

10
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:30,900
...my employers in the future
nab the target.

11
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:33,653
They zap him back to me, their looper.

12
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:37,824
He appears,
hands tied and head sacked.

13
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:40,284
And l do the necessaries.

14
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:42,829
Collect my silver.

15
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:46,082
So the target is vanished
from the future...

16
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,961
...and l've just disposed of a body
that technically does not exist.

17
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:54,924
Clean.

18
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:07,812
-How's the French?
-Slow.

19
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,356
-How's the coffee?
-Burnt.

20
00:03:22,578 --> 00:03:26,873
--devil bring you into hell!
You have to heal yourself.

21
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,053
Two, Jed.

22
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:49,645
Hey, Joe.

23
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:52,732
-Be at the club tonight?
-Yeah.

24
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,525
Four, Jed.

25
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,132
Hey, walk around.

26
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:04,011
Around the bike. l'm not kidding!
Wide, around, you shit!

27
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:06,973
Rude! lf you had a mama,
she didn't raise you right.

28
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,601
That's funny. l'm going to pick
your mother up later on my bike...

29
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:13,479
-...and l'm gonna take my blunderbuss--
-Hey, Seth.

30
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:16,023
-Hey, Joe.
-That's new.

31
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:17,817
Yeah, thanks.

32
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:20,987
Goddamn thing won't fucking start.

33
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,906
So you going to the Belle?

34
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:28,327
-So you bought a slat bike?
-Yup.

35
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,997
How much that thing set you back?
How much?

36
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,124
l was gonna pull up in it tonight.

37
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:36,293
Well, congratulations.
You're pulling up with me instead.

38
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:39,422
Don't. lf we're going in, don't do that.

39
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:42,341
-Chicks dig TKs.
-They do not.

40
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:46,387
-Yes, they do.
-lt's tacky. Don't do it.

41
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:52,685
About 1 0 percent of the population
has this TK mutation.

42
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:56,147
When it first appeared, everyone thought
we were gonna get superheroes.

43
00:05:57,482 --> 00:06:00,317
But it turns out this was it.
Now it's a bunch of assholes...

44
00:06:01,737 --> 00:06:03,362
...think they're blowing your mind
floating quarters.

45
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,959
lt's like this whole town.

46
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:20,588
Big heads, small potatoes.

47
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:31,974
-Full house tonight, Joe.
-We'll stick backstage.

48
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,685
-Just meeting up.
-Packing your blunderbusses?

49
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:36,854
-Hardly. Right, Seth?
-l'm with Joe.

50
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:39,356
-Just meeting up, in and out.
-Go on.

51
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:46,113
Suzie!

52
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:48,741
-Hey!
-You working a shift tonight?

53
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,493
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

54
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,120
A gat man bought me out
already for the night.

55
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:54,789
Oh.

56
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,000
Sweetie, l've got to work.

57
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:08,844
Hey, Joe.

58
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:17,645
-What?
-Zach. He's in there right now with Abe.

59
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:20,147
-For what?
-Closed his loop.

60
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:22,149
No shit?

61
00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:27,279
There's a reason we're called loopers.

62
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:32,701
When we sign up for this job,
taking out the future's garbage...

63
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:36,330
...we also agree
to a very specific proviso.

64
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,210
Time travel in the future is so illegal...

65
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:44,421
...that when our employers
want to close our contracts...

66
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:49,093
...they'll also want to erase any trace
of their relationship with us ever existing.

67
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:54,974
So if we're still alive
30 years from now...

68
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:59,937
...they'll find our older self,
zap him back to us...

69
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:03,065
...and we'll kill him like any otherjob.

70
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:07,736
This is called closing your loop.

71
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:12,449
You get a golden payday,
you get a handshake...

72
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,827
...and you get released
from your contract.

73
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:17,454
Enjoy the next 30 years.

74
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:22,626
This job doesn't tend to attract
the most forward-thinking people.

75
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:25,588
So we celebrating?

76
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,923
Yeah! Yeah!

77
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,628
Look out!

78
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,422
Shit.

79
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:13,594
Jesus.

80
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:15,804
Fuck, Joe.

81
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:54,301
What, fourth loop closed this month?

82
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:56,512
Loop closed. Here we go.

83
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:12,736
Loop closed, baby!

84
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,603
Yeah.

85
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:02,036
Seth?

86
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,954
Jesus.

87
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,249
They could be here any minute.

88
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,001
-Are they here?
-No. Who?

89
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:13,172
Oh, Christ. Joe, Christ!

90
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,799
-What are you doing?
-Give me the gun.

91
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:17,551
Oh, right. That's smart.

92
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:19,762
-Get away from the window.
-Christ, Joe.

93
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,097
-Just quiet down.
-You can protect me.

94
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:23,932
-So they--
-What did you do?

95
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,102
Oh, jeez. This is like a nightmare.

96
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:29,646
This is a nightmare.

97
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:33,192
l knew then what he did,
so l don't know why I asked.

98
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,110
What did you do?

99
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:40,491
He-- He was singing.

100
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:46,372
Through the gag and sack,
but l could hear the tune.

101
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:49,291
Deep memories...

102
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:52,252
...my mom in a dark room...

103
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,339
...taking care of me, singing that tune.

104
00:11:57,425 --> 00:12:01,762
Once l knew he was me....

105
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:09,186
Joe, l couldn't.

106
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:12,356
l couldn't. l had to see.

107
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:18,946
He told me-- l remember, he told me...

108
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:23,534
...there's a new holy terror boss man
in the future...

109
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:26,286
...and he's closing all the loops.

110
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:28,956
The Rainmaker, they call him.

111
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:34,002
He told me it.
Then he wanted a cigarette.

112
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:38,757
So l untied him,
and he gives me this look.

113
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:43,303
And he just starts running.

114
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:45,806
I had my blunderbuss...

115
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:49,435
...so l know l've got about 1 5 strides
until he's out of my range.

116
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,770
And they come and they go...

117
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:56,316
...and l just watch him until he's gone.

118
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:59,319
This is called letting your loop run.

119
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,321
lt's not a good thing.

120
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,365
What do l do?

121
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:08,495
You're the only friend l've got, Joe.
You've got to help me.

122
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:12,416
You're a fucking idiot coming here.

123
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,170
You can't be here.
l'll give you some money.

124
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:19,381
Joe! A little money?
Where am l gonna go?

125
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:22,676
You hop a freight train.
You beat it the hell out of town.

126
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:30,642
Just don't move.

127
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,771
Tell Court, watch the window outside.

128
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,607
You got it, window.

129
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,152
-Kid Blue, Joe! Come on!
-Just a minute!

130
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,780
-Open this goddamn door!
-l can't do anything for you, Seth.

131
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:47,743
You've got to hide me!
Please, Joe! Hide me!

132
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:51,997
Please! Just buy me some time
and then l'll go! Please?

133
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,124
You gonna make me
blow this door down?

134
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:56,001
Yeah, hold on!

135
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:58,837
Please?

136
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,423
Move. Move.

137
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,551
Come on, Joe! Open up!

138
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,771
Jesus.

139
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:27,991
-That took a while.
-You think it's easy looking this good?

140
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:32,079
Tye's gonna watch your apartment while
we go have a talk with Abe.

141
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,748
There's coffee in the tin.

142
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,208
Thank you.

143
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:57,145
Give me two minutes.

144
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:13,579
Know why they call that pea shooter
of yours a blunderbuss?

145
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:17,666
Because it's impossible to hit anything
farther than 1 5 yards.

146
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:20,502
lmpossible to miss anything closer.

147
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:23,839
lt's a gun for fuck-up turkeys.

148
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:25,591
Not like a gat.

149
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:30,178
A gat has range.

150
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,848
Accuracy.

151
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,436
Kid, cut it out.
Don't blow your other foot off.

152
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:05,756
-Fuck!
-What the hell is going on out there?

153
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,800
-How you doing, Abe?
-Hey, Joe.

154
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,970
You didn't shoot your other foot off,
did you, Kid?

155
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:16,558
All right.

156
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:23,065
My great-grandfather told my
grandfather, "Men are like spiders.

157
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:26,735
lt's the little ones
you've got to be careful of."

158
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:29,154
Don't know l agree with that.

159
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:30,739
Yeah?

160
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:34,451
What the fuck
did my great-grandfather know?

161
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:36,745
This man is from the future.

162
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:41,041
He was sent back here by the mob,
a one-way ticket, to run the loopers.

163
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:44,044
That's low effort, even for Abe,
so to pass the time...

164
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:48,256
...he recruited some real muscle,
the gat men. Now he runs the city.

165
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:51,593
Any other city,
that would be impressive.

166
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:07,317
How can you kids
stand to wear those chokers?

167
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,028
-Cravats?
-Ties.

168
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:12,906
Ridiculous. You're aware
we don't have a dress code?

169
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:15,867
-Fashion.
-You know-- Well, you don't know.

170
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:19,538
The movies that you're dressing like
are just copying other movies.

171
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:23,709
These goddamn 20th century
affectations.

172
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,544
Do something new.

173
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:30,674
Put a glowing thing
around your neck or use rubberized....

174
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,301
-Just be new.
-Okay.

175
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:43,437
-lt was nice chatting with you, Abe.
-l do like you, Joe.

176
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:46,398
But we're sure enough
that Seth paid you a visit.

177
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,358
-We have to do something.
-Seth?

178
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:51,945
You're expecting we're gonna
break your fingers with a hammer...

179
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:53,572
...or something awful.

180
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:57,409
But l'm gonna defuse that tension right
now. That's not gonna happen.

181
00:17:57,577 --> 00:18:01,371
What is gonna happen
is that l'm gonna talk for a little.

182
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:03,540
Not even that long.

183
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,876
And you're gonna give up
your friend.

184
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:10,172
My friend? Seth? Sorry, l'm confused.

185
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,174
Well, then l'll talk a little.

186
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:15,260
You know, you were the youngest looper
l ever hired.

187
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:18,430
You looked goddamn ridiculous,
they said.

188
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,850
Blunderbuss up to here on you.

189
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:25,729
-They brought you in. l forget what for.
-Watch shop.

190
00:18:25,897 --> 00:18:29,733
Yeah. You rolled one of our fronts,
a watch shop.

191
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:34,571
And they had you, you know.
This kid, like an animal.

192
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:38,533
But you looked at me,
your hair stuck to half your face...

193
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:41,995
...just one eye looking at me.
l could see...

194
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:47,042
...like seeing it happen on the TV,
the bad version of your life.

195
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:52,714
Like a vision,
l could see how you'd turn bad.

196
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:54,883
So l changed it.

197
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:59,179
l cleaned you up
and put a gun in your hand.

198
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,100
-l gave you something that was yours.
-l'm grateful for that, Abe.

199
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:08,021
l gave you something that was yours.

200
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:11,608
And l remember that kid.

201
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:18,657
And l think if you ask yourself, you ask,
"Who would l sacrifice for what's mine?"

202
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:22,577
l think Seth would be deep and cozy
inside that circle.

203
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:27,749
l'll show you how much l know you.

204
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:31,920
l'm not even gonna break you.
l'm just gonna set you back a ways.

205
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:36,550
We know that you've been stashing
half your bars.

206
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:39,719
Which is smart, no law against it.
You're gonna get out.

207
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:42,681
You're gonna go overseas.
Studying up your Mandarin?

208
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:45,058
-French.
-French?

209
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:51,106
You give him up
or you give us half your stash.

210
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:54,651
You willing to dump
your silver in the dirt...

211
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,862
...for Seth?

212
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:08,331
You're gonna kill him.

213
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:13,003
Not if we can help it. Be too cataclysmic
a change for the future.

214
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,922
What we'll do is dangerous
in that regards...

215
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:18,258
...though not as dangerous
as killing him.

216
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:22,596
On top of which, a man from the future
runs free long enough...

217
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:26,933
...this time travel shit
fries your brain like an egg.

218
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:28,393
Why the fuck French?

219
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:30,979
l'm going to France.

220
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:33,732
-You should go to China.
-l'm going to France.

221
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,318
l'm from the future.
You should go to China.

222
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,778
-l'm going to France.
-You're going....

223
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,126
The floor safe, under the rug.

224
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:56,004
Six seven four two.

225
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:04,054
lt's the little ones that get you.

226
00:21:10,353 --> 00:21:14,522
Why don't you kill an hour, Joe.
On the house.

227
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:20,695
Call the doc.

228
00:22:57,668 --> 00:22:59,294
Wait.

229
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:02,338
Wait!

230
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:05,884
Wait.

231
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:14,536
You know,
l can't remember my mother's face.

232
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:19,332
She used to run her hands
through my hair.

233
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:26,506
Just like this.

234
00:24:43,566 --> 00:24:46,901
l think l just let my best friend
get killed tonight.

235
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:49,445
For silver.

236
00:24:55,578 --> 00:24:56,870
Shit.

237
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,413
Yeah.

238
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:00,832
Shit.

239
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:06,045
Sorry.

240
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:10,425
l'm gonna give you some money.

241
00:25:10,593 --> 00:25:14,429
l've been stashing my silver for years
and l'm gonna give you half of it.

242
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,473
You can raise your kid right.

243
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:19,559
You wanna give me half your silver?

244
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:23,730
Silver's got strings. l got my job.

245
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:27,525
You got yours.

246
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:31,696
lt's sweet of you to worry about me,
but l'm doing fine.

247
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:36,701
Why don't we just stick
to services rendered.

248
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:43,583
ls this what you want?

249
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:49,417
Shit!

250
00:29:29,435 --> 00:29:32,520
Then it just becomes a mess,
like a pig fucking a football.

251
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:35,565
You know what l'm saying.
Let's finish this up.

252
00:29:38,402 --> 00:29:41,362
There's 24 there. l'm keeping count.

253
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,741
Two more trips should just do it.

254
00:30:07,473 --> 00:30:09,056
Goddamn it!

255
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:15,396
Kid, l'm sorry!
Tell Abe l'm gonna fix this!

256
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:19,984
Tell him l'm gonna find my loop
and l'm gonna kill him! Tell Abe--

257
00:30:21,612 --> 00:30:23,070
Motherfucker!

258
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:05,418
...Rainmaker...

259
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:32,523
Shit!

260
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:58,299
You got any aspirin?

261
00:36:58,592 --> 00:37:00,509
All of them, please.

262
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:06,849
l'll take that coat, too.

263
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:28,162
What are you doing?

264
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:33,792
What are you doing?
Joe, l told you to run.

265
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:59,735
Don't do it, you idiot.

266
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:05,824
Hurry up, Blue!

267
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:10,412
That's the second loop we had run
this week. lt's getting endemic.

268
00:38:12,332 --> 00:38:13,874
Fucking Kid Blue.

269
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:16,377
About two more trips should do it.

270
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:55,958
Shit.

271
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:19,565
You stupid little shit.

272
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:31,618
Pound the pavement,
sweep the train yard.

273
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:35,664
Every second that passes is bad.
Get on it.

274
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:38,208
Stupid little shit.

275
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,252
l can fix this.

276
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:43,756
-l can find him!
-Go home.

277
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:45,799
Let the grownups work.

278
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:48,969
Kid Blue.

279
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:30,302
You bastard. How do l find you?

280
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:39,598
Coffee?

281
00:42:41,851 --> 00:42:43,435
Please.

282
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:46,438
Black. And some water.

283
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:48,148
Anything else?

284
00:42:49,025 --> 00:42:50,484
We eating?

285
00:42:51,361 --> 00:42:55,030
-l ordered something.
-Steak and eggs. Rare and scrambled.

286
00:42:55,198 --> 00:42:57,241
Two steak and eggs, coming up.

287
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:04,248
Must hurt.

288
00:43:04,666 --> 00:43:08,377
-l wasn't sure you'd remember her.
-l put it together.

289
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:10,504
Clever.

290
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:20,806
You know, there's another girl
who works here on the weekends.

291
00:43:22,976 --> 00:43:26,603
-Jen?
-Right. Less letters.

292
00:43:27,355 --> 00:43:29,106
That'd be better.

293
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:38,991
How's your French coming?

294
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:42,661
Good. You gonna tell me l ought to be
learning Mandarin?

295
00:43:42,829 --> 00:43:44,621
l never regretted learning French.

296
00:43:44,914 --> 00:43:48,083
l know you have a gun
between your legs.

297
00:43:49,669 --> 00:43:52,212
No? Well, you'll get it eventually.

298
00:43:53,298 --> 00:43:55,215
-Obviously.
-All right, listen.

299
00:43:55,383 --> 00:43:59,052
This is a hard situation, but we both know
how this has to go down.

300
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:01,555
l can't let you walk away
from this diner.

301
00:44:01,723 --> 00:44:04,641
This is my life now. l earned it.
You had yours already.

302
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:09,563
So why don't you do what old men do
and die? Get the fuck out of my way.

303
00:44:09,731 --> 00:44:13,108
Why don't you take your gun out
from between your legs and do it?

304
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:17,154
Boy.

305
00:44:22,994 --> 00:44:25,454
lt's hard staring into your eyes.

306
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:30,375
-lt's too strange.
-Your face looks backwards.

307
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:36,173
So you know what's gonna happen?
You've done all this already?

308
00:44:36,341 --> 00:44:38,884
l don't want to talk about
time travel shit.

309
00:44:39,052 --> 00:44:42,095
lf we start talking about it,
we're gonna be here all day.

310
00:44:42,263 --> 00:44:43,930
Making diagrams with straws.

311
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:47,100
-lt doesn't matter.
-l hurt myself, it changes your body.

312
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:50,270
-Does what l do change your memories?
-lt doesn't matter!

313
00:45:02,909 --> 00:45:04,826
My memory is cloudy.

314
00:45:05,995 --> 00:45:07,788
lt's a cloud.

315
00:45:08,498 --> 00:45:10,916
Because my memories
aren't really memories.

316
00:45:11,084 --> 00:45:13,835
They're just one possible
eventuality now.

317
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:21,134
And they grow clearer or cloudier
as they become more or less likely.

318
00:45:21,302 --> 00:45:25,639
But then they get to the present moment,
and they're instantly clear again.

319
00:45:26,474 --> 00:45:29,476
l can remember
what you do after you do it.

320
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:33,980
And it hurts.

321
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:36,316
So even when we're apart...

322
00:45:36,484 --> 00:45:38,693
-...you can remember what l do after?
-Yes.

323
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:43,073
But this is a precise description
of a fuzzy mechanism.

324
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:45,617
lt's messy.

325
00:45:46,119 --> 00:45:47,953
All l know-- l know two things.

326
00:45:48,121 --> 00:45:52,416
l know what's happening in my head.
And l know that you're gonna meet her.

327
00:45:58,297 --> 00:45:59,464
Who?

328
00:46:04,971 --> 00:46:07,139
She's gonna save your life.

329
00:46:12,979 --> 00:46:15,647
For a long time, she thought we'd....

330
00:46:16,649 --> 00:46:18,817
We'd have a baby.

331
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:24,030
She'd have been a great mother.

332
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:29,077
-She wanted it so much.
-Yeah, but she--?

333
00:46:30,163 --> 00:46:31,538
How--?

334
00:46:33,166 --> 00:46:35,000
So she saves my life?

335
00:46:35,168 --> 00:46:36,626
Yes.

336
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:39,588
Let's take a look at your life.

337
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:42,424
You're a killer. And a junkie.

338
00:46:42,592 --> 00:46:44,718
A fucking child mentality.

339
00:46:44,886 --> 00:46:48,555
"What's mine." "My life." Save your life.
You're asking me how?

340
00:46:48,723 --> 00:46:51,892
The question is why. Why would
someone sacrifice their life?

341
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:54,686
Cut your high and mighty bullshit.
l don't need my life--

342
00:46:54,854 --> 00:46:57,355
Shut your fucking child mouth.

343
00:46:59,734 --> 00:47:01,568
You're so self-absorbed and stupid.

344
00:47:01,736 --> 00:47:04,654
And she's gonna clean you up
and she's gonna....

345
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:17,167
You're gonna take her love
like a sponge.

346
00:47:17,335 --> 00:47:20,587
And you think,
"Maybe l'm clear of the past.

347
00:47:20,755 --> 00:47:22,547
Maybe l'm safe."

348
00:47:24,133 --> 00:47:25,509
Yesterday.

349
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:28,094
Yesterday what?

350
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:31,932
Thirty years from now is yesterday.

351
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:35,560
You're not gonna remember it.

352
00:47:46,322 --> 00:47:48,114
I'm gonna tell you what happens...

353
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:52,077
...to this beautiful woman
who saves your worthless fucking life.

354
00:48:36,205 --> 00:48:38,748
Have you heard of the Rainmaker?

355
00:48:40,585 --> 00:48:43,587
Yeah, Seth said that night.

356
00:48:44,255 --> 00:48:47,382
New boss in the future?
He used the words "holy terror."

357
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:50,260
Yeah. A reign of terror.

358
00:48:50,428 --> 00:48:54,306
Mass executions. Vagrant purges.
Everywhere at once.

359
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:57,100
Legend is the Rainmaker
came out of nowhere.

360
00:48:57,268 --> 00:49:01,354
ln the span of six months, he took total
control of the five major syndicates.

361
00:49:01,522 --> 00:49:03,898
-That'd take an army.
-He didn't have an army.

362
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:06,484
The story is that he did it alone.

363
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:09,195
-Alone alone.
-So how did he do it?

364
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:13,742
That's the mystery. There's no pictures
of him. Even if it is a him. lt's insane.

365
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:18,413
There are stories he has a synthetic jaw,
saw his mom shot, shit like that.

366
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:20,957
Word spread through
the ex-looper grapevine...

367
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:25,086
...because the first thing he did
was start closing loops. All of them.

368
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:31,968
You know what this is? This number?

369
00:49:32,136 --> 00:49:33,345
Dale, wait. Slow down.

370
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:37,140
lt could lead us to the Rainmaker,
Joe! lt's in the hospital records.

371
00:49:37,308 --> 00:49:40,477
Write this down: 0, 7, 1 , 5, 3...

372
00:49:40,645 --> 00:49:43,313
...9, 0, 2, 9, 3, 5!

373
00:49:52,073 --> 00:49:55,992
This is a piece of identifying information
on the Rainmaker.

374
00:49:56,160 --> 00:50:01,498
He's here. He lives here now.
In this county.

375
00:50:01,666 --> 00:50:03,833
And l'm gonna use this to find him.

376
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:06,086
And l'm gonna kill him.

377
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:08,463
l'm gonna stop him
from killing my wife.

378
00:50:08,631 --> 00:50:12,592
Fuck you. And your wife.
None of this concerns me.

379
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:15,053
-This is gonna happen--
-lt happened to you.

380
00:50:15,221 --> 00:50:19,432
lt doesn't have to happen to me. You
got her picture right there in my watch?

381
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:22,435
Show me the picture.
As soon as l see her, l walk away.

382
00:50:22,603 --> 00:50:25,480
l'll fucking marry someone else.
Promise.

383
00:50:25,648 --> 00:50:29,150
When l see that picture,
that fog inside your brain should just...

384
00:50:29,318 --> 00:50:32,404
...swallow up all the memories,
right? She'll be gone.

385
00:50:32,613 --> 00:50:35,949
-lf you give her up, she'll be safe.
-Give her up?

386
00:50:36,117 --> 00:50:40,078
You're the one that got her killed.
lf she never meets you, she's safe.

387
00:50:40,246 --> 00:50:42,914
You don't understand.
We don't have to give her up.

388
00:50:43,082 --> 00:50:46,876
l'm not gonna give her up.
l'm gonna save her.

389
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:04,352
Get to the fields.
We can lose them in the fields.

390
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:08,690
Hop a train. Get out of town!

391
00:51:33,132 --> 00:51:37,427
What the hell is everybody doing?
You wait for my signal!

392
00:51:37,595 --> 00:51:40,305
-Out back! He's running!
-He ran out the back!

393
00:51:50,733 --> 00:51:52,066
Shit!

394
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:00,158
Alive!

395
00:52:06,707 --> 00:52:08,541
Fuck! Shit! Come on, come on!

396
00:52:08,709 --> 00:52:11,085
Come on, you piece of shit! Come on!

397
00:52:20,763 --> 00:52:23,431
-Get the tracker! The tracker!
-Go! Go!

398
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:25,600
Fuck! Fuck!

399
00:52:26,936 --> 00:52:28,520
Shit.

400
00:54:11,624 --> 00:54:14,083
Come on, baby. Time to get up.

401
00:54:54,917 --> 00:54:57,251
Listen up, fucker!

402
00:54:57,419 --> 00:55:03,049
l have shot and buried
three vagrants in the past year!

403
00:55:03,467 --> 00:55:07,178
So l don't care
what hobo sob story you've got.

404
00:55:07,346 --> 00:55:10,807
l get a dozen a week, pal.
lt cuts no cash with me.

405
00:55:10,975 --> 00:55:16,229
But if you show your face here again,
l will cut you the fuck in half!

406
00:55:57,354 --> 00:56:01,357
Well, you found him.

407
00:56:02,109 --> 00:56:05,486
Tracking Seth's bike, that was clever.

408
00:56:05,654 --> 00:56:08,781
Then you rustled up a posse
and went out to get him.

409
00:56:08,949 --> 00:56:12,326
-l could do it again.
-You can fuck up again? Really?

410
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:14,746
l've got too much riding, Kid.

411
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:18,791
l can't afford a fuck-up playing cowboy.

412
00:56:19,752 --> 00:56:21,544
Put your gat on the table.

413
00:56:39,855 --> 00:56:42,440
l wanted you to say l did good.

414
00:56:44,943 --> 00:56:46,527
That's all l wanted.

415
00:56:48,989 --> 00:56:51,407
This is all l have.

416
00:56:58,916 --> 00:57:00,750
Please give me one more chance?

417
00:57:00,918 --> 00:57:04,128
l'll bring him here alive and hold him.

418
00:57:04,963 --> 00:57:07,715
And you can put a bullet
in his brain yourself.

419
00:57:09,134 --> 00:57:10,426
No!

420
00:57:16,809 --> 00:57:19,894
Get off me! Get off me!

421
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:10,987
Hey, who's there?

422
00:58:15,993 --> 00:58:19,078
Stop right there! l will shoot you.

423
00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:23,916
You stop! Stop right there!

424
00:58:27,171 --> 00:58:30,423
l'm telling you to stop! You stop!

425
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:03,581
Head's splitting apart.

426
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:05,958
-My head.
-Hey.

427
00:59:06,126 --> 00:59:09,128
Look up at the light. Look up at me.

428
00:59:09,296 --> 00:59:10,755
How long since you dropped?

429
00:59:10,923 --> 00:59:12,798
-Dropped?
-Dropped.

430
00:59:13,467 --> 00:59:15,384
-A day.
-A day.

431
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:16,928
l can't feel my legs.

432
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:19,805
You're going through withdrawal,
you fucking junkie.

433
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:22,266
You gotta help me. l'm gonna die.

434
00:59:23,477 --> 00:59:25,311
l'm thirsty.

435
00:59:26,104 --> 00:59:28,439
Water. Water!

436
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:46,832
Thirsty....

437
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:01,973
Cid!

438
01:00:03,308 --> 01:00:05,059
Come inside, baby.

439
01:00:06,979 --> 01:00:09,105
-Who is that man?
-He's just a vagrant.

440
01:00:09,273 --> 01:00:11,357
-No, he's not.
-Oh, yeah?

441
01:00:11,525 --> 01:00:13,818
His shoes are too shiny.

442
01:00:13,986 --> 01:00:15,903
Aren't you a smart monkey.

443
01:00:16,071 --> 01:00:18,447
-ls he sick?
-Yup.

444
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:21,033
-Will he get better?
-Yeah.

445
01:00:21,201 --> 01:00:25,246
-Promise?
-Just go to sleep, okay, baby boy?

446
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:32,211
-Night, sweetie.
-Night, Sara.

447
01:01:09,333 --> 01:01:10,833
Hey!

448
01:01:20,093 --> 01:01:22,261
The first time l saw her face.

449
01:01:22,429 --> 01:01:24,055
First time l saw her face.

450
01:01:24,222 --> 01:01:25,973
Look at me.

451
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:27,850
No.

452
01:01:28,018 --> 01:01:30,102
The first time l saw her face.

453
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:34,982
The first time l saw her face.
The first time l saw your face.

454
01:01:35,150 --> 01:01:37,610
The first time l saw her face.

455
01:02:19,152 --> 01:02:22,446
Morning, monkey.
Do you want something to eat?

456
01:02:22,614 --> 01:02:24,657
The man is up.

457
01:02:25,492 --> 01:02:27,701
ls he staying here now?

458
01:02:27,953 --> 01:02:29,286
No.

459
01:02:35,377 --> 01:02:36,794
Toss it.

460
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:40,548
-l'm about to finish cleaning it.
-Put it down.

461
01:02:44,136 --> 01:02:46,762
-How are you feeling?
-l'd say l'm at 30 percent.

462
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:49,932
You take it slow,
by the end of the week you'll be at 50.

463
01:02:52,727 --> 01:02:55,104
l took you in so you wouldn't die.
You're not.

464
01:02:55,272 --> 01:02:58,107
Take the morning to rest,
then get off my farm.

465
01:02:58,275 --> 01:03:00,234
-l can't do that.
-l'm sorry?

466
01:03:00,402 --> 01:03:02,445
l need to stay here for a little while.

467
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:04,363
-l'm not cool with that.
-Sorry.

468
01:03:04,531 --> 01:03:07,533
You just lost your
"take the morning to rest" privileges.

469
01:03:07,701 --> 01:03:09,160
-Get off my farm.
-No.

470
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:11,328
Get off my farm.

471
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:14,415
You couldn't scare a retarded hobo
with that. Literally.

472
01:03:14,583 --> 01:03:17,334
This is a Remington 870.
One blast could cut you--

473
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:19,879
ln half. That's telling.
You're holding a gun.

474
01:03:20,046 --> 01:03:22,923
l say l'm not afraid,
so you describe the gun to me.

475
01:03:23,091 --> 01:03:24,967
lt's not the gun l'm not afraid of.

476
01:03:25,135 --> 01:03:27,178
What are you gonna do,
shoot in the air?

477
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:30,181
You wouldn't let me die,
you're not gonna kill me.

478
01:03:30,348 --> 01:03:31,891
So that makes me weak?

479
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:35,561
l'm not a threat to you or your boy.
l need to be on your property.

480
01:03:35,729 --> 01:03:39,231
l'd rather there's no contact at all.
l'm gonna stay in the fields.

481
01:03:39,399 --> 01:03:43,235
There's one thing l need, then you'll
never have to deal with me again.

482
01:03:43,403 --> 01:03:46,113
Verify this is your house
so l'm in the right place.

483
01:03:46,281 --> 01:03:48,407
-What's this?
-lt's a map.

484
01:03:48,575 --> 01:03:50,326
That's my house.
Why is it marked?

485
01:03:50,494 --> 01:03:54,330
Okay, doesn't matter. Look,
l'm gonna be out of the barn in an hour.

486
01:03:54,498 --> 01:03:57,208
lf you can spare it,
l'm gonna take this canteen.

487
01:03:57,375 --> 01:04:01,045
-ls there somewhere l can fill it?
-This number, how did you get this?

488
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:04,757
That mean something to you?

489
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:08,969
What? Hey! Hey! Hey!

490
01:04:22,567 --> 01:04:24,527
You're right. l'm not a killer.

491
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:28,405
But l'm fine with how a blast of rock salt
to your face won't kill you.

492
01:04:28,573 --> 01:04:31,283
Now you're gonna tell me
who you are...

493
01:04:31,451 --> 01:04:34,620
...and what the fuck
you're doing on my farm.

494
01:04:34,788 --> 01:04:36,288
Okay.

495
01:04:38,458 --> 01:04:41,168
Time travel hasn't been invented yet...

496
01:04:41,336 --> 01:04:45,714
...but in 30 years, it will have been.
lt's gonna be used by these criminal--

497
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:47,550
You're a looper?

498
01:05:00,105 --> 01:05:02,815
l can't go back to the city
because Abe, the boss...

499
01:05:02,983 --> 01:05:07,403
...his men will be searching for me 24/7
until they find me. Or find him.

500
01:05:07,571 --> 01:05:08,904
All l've got is that map.

501
01:05:09,364 --> 01:05:12,783
He had three houses marked on it,
yours is one of them.

502
01:05:12,951 --> 01:05:15,035
l know he's coming here.

503
01:05:16,496 --> 01:05:18,789
You know about loopers?
You know what we do?

504
01:05:18,957 --> 01:05:22,626
So he's coming here
to murder my son...

505
01:05:22,794 --> 01:05:25,671
...because he thinks he might be
this Rainmaker?

506
01:05:27,048 --> 01:05:29,300
Once he kills the Rainmaker,
what happens?

507
01:05:29,467 --> 01:05:32,386
l think he thinks if he killed
the Rainmaker...

508
01:05:32,554 --> 01:05:34,555
...he never would have been sent back.

509
01:05:34,723 --> 01:05:37,850
He'd just vanish.
He'd disappear just like he appeared.

510
01:05:39,269 --> 01:05:41,729
He'd be back with his wife.

511
01:05:43,064 --> 01:05:46,108
Who is he, this guy you let run?

512
01:05:46,276 --> 01:05:48,193
Just some random guy
from the future?

513
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:51,739
He's just somebody.
You know what the numbers mean?

514
01:05:55,243 --> 01:06:00,331
This is Cid's birthday and this is the med
code of the hospital he was born in.

515
01:06:06,630 --> 01:06:10,132
How many kids were born in
that hospital that day with your son?

516
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:12,051
-Like, two?
-Sounds right.

517
01:06:12,218 --> 01:06:15,512
Three kids, three houses
marked on his map.

518
01:06:15,764 --> 01:06:17,264
One of them is the Rainmaker.

519
01:06:17,432 --> 01:06:20,142
-He doesn't know which.
-What's he gonna do?

520
01:06:21,561 --> 01:06:23,479
Oh, God.

521
01:08:11,838 --> 01:08:15,424
-Can he really do this?
-Think about what doing this would fix.

522
01:08:16,176 --> 01:08:18,385
What he thinks it would fix.

523
01:08:23,349 --> 01:08:25,809
lf he comes here, will you stop him?

524
01:08:28,062 --> 01:08:31,231
-l'm asking, can l trust you?
-l don't care if you trust me.

525
01:08:31,399 --> 01:08:33,400
l don't care about your son.

526
01:08:33,568 --> 01:08:36,862
l lost my life. l kill this man, l get it back.

527
01:08:41,451 --> 01:08:45,704
He'll kill the other two kids
and come here last. Put off facing me.

528
01:08:46,581 --> 01:08:49,333
All this goddamn cane leaves us blind.

529
01:08:49,501 --> 01:08:53,128
He can get within 50 yards of this place
without a hawk spotting him.

530
01:08:53,463 --> 01:08:56,131
What makes sense
is we burn the fields. Level them.

531
01:08:57,008 --> 01:08:59,384
How much gas you got in that barn?

532
01:08:59,761 --> 01:09:03,680
-No, you can't burn down my cane fields.
-This stuff is half dead anyway.

533
01:09:03,848 --> 01:09:09,311
lt's the seed for next year.
lt's not gonna happen, you fucking nut.

534
01:09:15,068 --> 01:09:17,444
Listen, use what you need
and set up anywhere.

535
01:09:17,612 --> 01:09:20,197
But one thing:
l don't want you talking to Cid.

536
01:09:20,365 --> 01:09:22,282
l watch my son, you watch the cane.

537
01:09:22,450 --> 01:09:24,034
-That's the deal.
-Good by me.

538
01:09:24,202 --> 01:09:25,619
Fine.

539
01:09:25,787 --> 01:09:28,205
-Jesus.
-All right, hold still.

540
01:09:29,958 --> 01:09:33,168
lt's easy for things to get infected
on a farm.

541
01:09:33,336 --> 01:09:34,962
Start falling off.

542
01:09:37,423 --> 01:09:39,007
Pussy.

543
01:09:41,886 --> 01:09:45,389
l'm out here and you're in the house.
We need a way to communicate.

544
01:09:45,557 --> 01:09:49,518
There's a dinner bell in the barn.
You can ring that if someone's coming.

545
01:09:49,686 --> 01:09:53,480
Dinner bell. We need buzzers
or walkies or something.

546
01:09:53,648 --> 01:09:57,943
l don't know what we've got,
but l'll look. Cid!

547
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:02,865
-How's the math coming?
-l want to help the man.

548
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:05,868
-Help him with what?
-l could help him with my toys.

549
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:07,870
No. Let me talk to you.

550
01:10:08,788 --> 01:10:11,331
l need you to stay away
from that man. Okay?

551
01:10:11,499 --> 01:10:13,625
Let him do his thing, but stick with me.

552
01:10:13,793 --> 01:10:16,044
-Okay?
-ls he not good?

553
01:10:16,588 --> 01:10:19,131
Well, we're gonna see what he is.
All right?

554
01:10:19,299 --> 01:10:21,508
But l need you to stick with me.

555
01:10:21,676 --> 01:10:23,260
Good boy.

556
01:11:11,601 --> 01:11:13,852
Hand me that Phillips.

557
01:11:17,941 --> 01:11:21,234
-Tell me if you hear her coming.
-What are we doing here?

558
01:11:21,402 --> 01:11:23,403
Commundication.

559
01:11:26,074 --> 01:11:28,700
But l need to make it stronger.

560
01:11:28,868 --> 01:11:31,036
-And how do we do that?
-Bigger battery.

561
01:11:31,663 --> 01:11:33,246
Smart.

562
01:11:35,833 --> 01:11:38,168
Do you kill people?

563
01:11:43,883 --> 01:11:45,425
Let's say l kill people.

564
01:11:46,469 --> 01:11:47,761
With your gun?

565
01:11:51,516 --> 01:11:53,600
-You want a gun like mine?
-Yeah.

566
01:11:53,768 --> 01:11:57,896
What are you gonna do with it,
pole vaulting? lt's bigger than you.

567
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:01,817
Stop bad things from happening.

568
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:05,362
Shit!

569
01:12:20,586 --> 01:12:23,839
So how long you and your mom
been out here on the farm?

570
01:12:24,007 --> 01:12:25,757
She's not.

571
01:12:26,426 --> 01:12:28,135
She's not what?

572
01:12:29,095 --> 01:12:33,974
Sara doesn't know,
but l remember my real mom.

573
01:12:35,727 --> 01:12:39,980
When l was a baby, l couldn't stop it.

574
01:12:40,148 --> 01:12:42,065
Couldn't stop what?

575
01:12:43,192 --> 01:12:46,445
l couldn't stop her from getting killed.

576
01:12:46,612 --> 01:12:50,198
l saw it, but l couldn't stop it.

577
01:12:50,616 --> 01:12:53,243
l wasn't strong enough.

578
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:57,748
You should....

579
01:12:57,915 --> 01:13:03,879
-You should talk to your mom about this.
-She's not my mom. She's a liar.

580
01:13:17,769 --> 01:13:22,022
Spotted him coming out of a sewer tunnel
on the west end. He's on the run.

581
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:36,828
Think he's heading to the west
on Talbott Street...

582
01:13:36,996 --> 01:13:40,040
...possibly to Whore's Alley.
We have a visual.

583
01:13:42,877 --> 01:13:45,921
You can't take that thing out
with a plow or something?

584
01:13:49,967 --> 01:13:52,260
Listen, l found a....

585
01:13:53,763 --> 01:13:56,932
ln the barn, l found some parts
and l made a thing.

586
01:13:58,559 --> 01:13:59,976
Here.

587
01:14:01,312 --> 01:14:04,106
So if you see something, just push that.

588
01:14:05,817 --> 01:14:07,484
When?

589
01:14:09,403 --> 01:14:13,031
Last night he woke me up.
Don't tell him l told you. He didn't--

590
01:14:17,954 --> 01:14:19,996
You said you were his mom.

591
01:14:21,499 --> 01:14:22,958
Yeah.

592
01:14:23,626 --> 01:14:25,502
He told me you're not.

593
01:14:26,879 --> 01:14:28,713
He said that?

594
01:14:30,341 --> 01:14:31,716
Yeah.

595
01:14:32,593 --> 01:14:36,012
-lf he's not your son, who is he?
-He's my son.

596
01:14:38,141 --> 01:14:40,559
l had Cid when l was 22.

597
01:14:40,977 --> 01:14:43,603
But l didn't want to give up my life
in the city.

598
01:14:43,771 --> 01:14:47,566
So l dropped him here on the farm
with my sister...

599
01:14:47,733 --> 01:14:51,486
...and she saw how l was living,
so she took him.

600
01:14:51,654 --> 01:14:54,906
And my sister, she raised him.

601
01:14:57,160 --> 01:15:00,996
She loved him. He called her Mom.

602
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:08,879
How did she get killed?

603
01:15:09,380 --> 01:15:10,505
Jesus Christ.

604
01:15:10,673 --> 01:15:12,841
He remembers it.
You've gotta talk to him.

605
01:15:13,009 --> 01:15:16,469
l told you one thing.
l told you to stay away from my son.

606
01:15:16,637 --> 01:15:19,014
-He asked about my gun.
-Stay out of it!

607
01:15:19,348 --> 01:15:21,516
And stay the fuck away from my son!

608
01:15:24,437 --> 01:15:28,648
Where does 56 go?

609
01:15:29,609 --> 01:15:32,277
Oh, good. You're smart.

610
01:15:32,612 --> 01:15:33,653
Twenty-one?

611
01:15:33,821 --> 01:15:35,989
How long can you not sleep?

612
01:15:36,157 --> 01:15:39,951
l don't know. Probably a while.
lt's a good question.

613
01:15:40,119 --> 01:15:42,245
Where does it go? Come on.

614
01:15:44,373 --> 01:15:45,832
Good.

615
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,417
Thirty-two?

616
01:15:47,585 --> 01:15:50,587
-You should help Joe watch.
-Joe?

617
01:15:50,755 --> 01:15:53,006
Because he can't stay awake
all the time.

618
01:15:53,174 --> 01:15:55,800
-lsn't our business. Okay?
-He's keeping us safe.

619
01:15:55,968 --> 01:15:57,636
Let's do this now, okay?

620
01:15:57,803 --> 01:16:00,597
You have 32 there.
l know you know this one.

621
01:16:03,726 --> 01:16:07,062
-No. Eight times three is what?
-Thirty-two.

622
01:16:07,230 --> 01:16:09,272
Eight times three is what?

623
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:10,857
Thirty-two.

624
01:16:14,153 --> 01:16:19,366
-l want you to count three eights.
-Eight, sixteen...

625
01:16:20,993 --> 01:16:22,035
...thirty-two.

626
01:16:22,203 --> 01:16:24,412
-You telling me you want alone time?
-No.

627
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:27,374
Then why don't you put that
where it belongs?

628
01:16:33,297 --> 01:16:35,173
-Alone time.
-He's protecting us...

629
01:16:35,341 --> 01:16:37,133
...because you can't do it.

630
01:16:37,301 --> 01:16:40,845
-l told you to stay away from him, didn't l?
-l never did anything.

631
01:16:41,013 --> 01:16:42,889
-Do you think l'm stupid?
-So?

632
01:16:43,933 --> 01:16:45,517
-l told Joe to leave--
-So?!

633
01:16:45,685 --> 01:16:48,520
-You do what l tell you!
-You can't tell me what to do.

634
01:16:48,688 --> 01:16:50,105
You're not my mom!

635
01:16:50,273 --> 01:16:52,274
You're not my mom! You're a liar!

636
01:16:52,441 --> 01:16:55,193
You're gonna get killed
because you won't stop lying!

637
01:16:55,361 --> 01:16:57,737
-Cid, calm down.
-You're lying! l hate you!

638
01:16:57,905 --> 01:17:00,031
-You're lying to me! l hate you!
-Cid....

639
01:17:00,199 --> 01:17:03,493
-l hate you! Liar! You're lying!
-Calm down. Calm down.

640
01:17:19,635 --> 01:17:24,681
Liar!

641
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:28,518
You're not my mom! You're a liar!

642
01:17:33,816 --> 01:17:35,525
You're not my mom!

643
01:17:35,693 --> 01:17:36,901
l hate you!

644
01:17:37,069 --> 01:17:38,570
Liar!

645
01:17:38,738 --> 01:17:41,239
Liar! Liar!

646
01:18:14,357 --> 01:18:16,483
l'm sorry.

647
01:18:18,986 --> 01:18:21,404
lt's okay, sweetie.

648
01:19:07,993 --> 01:19:09,828
Holy shit.

649
01:20:03,007 --> 01:20:04,299
Evening, ma'am.

650
01:20:05,509 --> 01:20:08,178
Evening. How can l help you?

651
01:20:09,763 --> 01:20:13,224
You can start by accepting
my apologies re the hour.

652
01:20:13,392 --> 01:20:15,935
-Hope l didn't catch you at supper.
-That's fine.

653
01:20:16,103 --> 01:20:18,646
l've been walking
between empty farms all day.

654
01:20:18,814 --> 01:20:21,149
Thought l'd just
tick this one off the list.

655
01:20:21,317 --> 01:20:24,068
-Not have to come back tomorrow.
-What's this about?

656
01:20:24,904 --> 01:20:26,821
You alone here, ma'am?

657
01:20:26,989 --> 01:20:28,865
My husband should be back any time.

658
01:20:29,033 --> 01:20:30,700
Happy to hear it.

659
01:20:34,038 --> 01:20:36,289
Could l trouble you for some water?

660
01:20:36,707 --> 01:20:39,751
l'll get you some.
You can take the glass with you.

661
01:20:39,919 --> 01:20:41,711
Actually, ma'am...

662
01:20:41,879 --> 01:20:45,673
...my business today,
this ticking off the list business...

663
01:20:49,637 --> 01:20:52,472
-Will you tell me what this is about?
-l will, yes.

664
01:20:55,768 --> 01:20:57,435
Can l come in?

665
01:21:00,856 --> 01:21:02,398
Ma'am?

666
01:21:10,866 --> 01:21:14,327
l'm a deputized police officer,
looking for an escaped criminal.

667
01:21:15,329 --> 01:21:18,373
Anyone through here
in the past two days, vagrants?

668
01:21:18,541 --> 01:21:21,209
Vagrants are always passing,
nobody near the house.

669
01:21:21,377 --> 01:21:22,418
That man there?

670
01:21:23,504 --> 01:21:25,547
He's young. No.

671
01:21:25,714 --> 01:21:29,509
We're looking for his father, too.
Similar looking build, late 50s...

672
01:21:29,677 --> 01:21:32,178
...may or may not be traveling together.

673
01:21:34,181 --> 01:21:35,890
Do you recognize them?

674
01:21:37,268 --> 01:21:39,936
-No.
-Keep them.

675
01:21:41,814 --> 01:21:43,815
Your kids with your husband?

676
01:21:45,651 --> 01:21:47,110
Yeah, just one.

677
01:21:47,278 --> 01:21:49,696
-How old?
-Ten.

678
01:21:49,863 --> 01:21:51,406
Ten....

679
01:22:11,802 --> 01:22:13,761
l'm gonna show you
the barn and house.

680
01:22:13,929 --> 01:22:15,847
And then you can be on your way.

681
01:22:16,015 --> 01:22:19,601
l took the liberty with your barn.
Apologies.

682
01:22:20,936 --> 01:22:23,563
So the house.

683
01:22:38,871 --> 01:22:41,372
-Ten, you said? Your boy?
-Yeah.

684
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:43,041
And your husband?

685
01:22:44,335 --> 01:22:47,545
l've just gotta check in
with the home office.

686
01:22:49,340 --> 01:22:52,592
The boy's in the city with his father.
When they getting back?

687
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:54,344
Couldn't tell you.

688
01:23:00,643 --> 01:23:02,101
This goddamn thing.

689
01:23:02,770 --> 01:23:05,897
l can never get a signal
this far out of town.

690
01:23:08,233 --> 01:23:10,026
Piece of shit.

691
01:23:15,658 --> 01:23:17,909
Okay. Here we go.

692
01:23:18,869 --> 01:23:20,078
ls this man dangerous?

693
01:23:20,621 --> 01:23:24,499
He shoots men down for a living.
He's a stone-cold killer.

694
01:23:24,667 --> 01:23:27,794
My boss has half the city
looking for him.

695
01:23:27,961 --> 01:23:30,380
Half the city and me, so....

696
01:23:30,589 --> 01:23:33,049
And if you find him,
there's a hell of a price.

697
01:23:33,217 --> 01:23:36,761
Chunk of money like that,
you should think on it.

698
01:23:36,929 --> 01:23:41,391
-l will.
-All right. Show me upstairs.

699
01:23:42,810 --> 01:23:45,228
There's drafts in the house.

700
01:24:04,998 --> 01:24:08,584
My granddad built this tunnel
when the vagrant raids got bad.

701
01:24:09,044 --> 01:24:12,213
-Nana said he was nuts.
-Thank you, Granddad.

702
01:24:12,381 --> 01:24:16,759
-That wasn't the man.
-No. lt's funny. l know that guy, though.

703
01:24:16,927 --> 01:24:21,514
His name is Jesse.
l like him. He's good.

704
01:24:21,932 --> 01:24:24,475
He's gonna go away
once he doesn't find me.

705
01:24:24,643 --> 01:24:26,644
He won't hurt your mom.

706
01:24:27,020 --> 01:24:29,981
-Sara.
-Where's your mom?

707
01:24:31,650 --> 01:24:33,443
Where's my mom?

708
01:24:36,321 --> 01:24:40,867
She gave me up.
l was younger than you.

709
01:24:42,161 --> 01:24:45,747
We were vagrants,
and she was alone.

710
01:24:47,249 --> 01:24:50,543
l thought she was stupid
for getting on the drugs she was on...

711
01:24:50,711 --> 01:24:54,213
...but now l see she was just so alone.

712
01:24:55,132 --> 01:24:56,966
lt's what she had.

713
01:24:58,093 --> 01:25:00,762
She sold me to a panhandle gang.

714
01:25:01,847 --> 01:25:05,099
l got away and l ran
and ended up on this train.

715
01:25:05,267 --> 01:25:07,810
l remember l was sitting there
in an empty car.

716
01:25:08,479 --> 01:25:10,480
And l saw myself
over and over again...

717
01:25:10,647 --> 01:25:15,401
...killing those men that bought me,
that got my mom on what she was on.

718
01:25:15,569 --> 01:25:19,530
Just finding them and tearing them apart.
Saving my mom.

719
01:25:19,698 --> 01:25:20,948
But you didn't.

720
01:25:22,242 --> 01:25:24,994
No, a man in the city found me,
put a gun in my hand.

721
01:25:25,162 --> 01:25:26,954
Gave me something that was mine.

722
01:25:28,290 --> 01:25:31,292
That's just men trying to figure out
what they would do...

723
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:33,795
...to keep what's theirs,
what they've got.

724
01:25:34,463 --> 01:25:36,881
That's the only kind of man there is.

725
01:25:37,049 --> 01:25:40,092
l'm not gonna let Sara get killed.

726
01:25:51,438 --> 01:25:53,356
l think we're clear.

727
01:26:04,701 --> 01:26:06,536
Sara!

728
01:26:09,790 --> 01:26:11,499
Baby.

729
01:26:29,226 --> 01:26:31,561
All working girls, yeah?

730
01:26:31,728 --> 01:26:35,690
This whole block
and a couple of blocks over.

731
01:26:37,150 --> 01:26:38,317
Hello, Joe.

732
01:26:38,485 --> 01:26:41,362
lf you want to check those,
too, l can arrange.

733
01:26:45,701 --> 01:26:47,827
l'm an arranger, stranger.

734
01:26:47,995 --> 01:26:50,746
lf you don't see
what you want to see, no refunds.

735
01:27:55,228 --> 01:27:56,520
What?

736
01:27:58,774 --> 01:28:00,316
What happened?

737
01:28:46,697 --> 01:28:49,031
That's pretty good.

738
01:28:51,576 --> 01:28:54,161
ln the city, young guys would...

739
01:28:54,329 --> 01:28:58,624
...hit on me
by floating fucking quarters.

740
01:28:58,792 --> 01:29:02,044
And l wouldn't tell them l was TK...

741
01:29:02,212 --> 01:29:04,964
...but l would keep their quarters down.

742
01:29:05,257 --> 01:29:10,720
This one guy just busted a blood vessel
in his eye trying to get it up.

743
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:25,401
He's you.

744
01:29:26,028 --> 01:29:27,737
Your loop.

745
01:29:29,197 --> 01:29:31,073
You lied to me.

746
01:29:32,743 --> 01:29:36,579
But l know you're not lying
when you say you're gonna kill this guy...

747
01:29:36,747 --> 01:29:38,789
...your own self.

748
01:29:38,999 --> 01:29:42,043
You protected Cid from that gat man.

749
01:29:45,630 --> 01:29:47,548
-Yeah.
-He saved your ass, didn't he?

750
01:29:47,716 --> 01:29:49,467
He saved my ass.

751
01:29:49,926 --> 01:29:51,594
He's a....

752
01:29:54,598 --> 01:29:56,265
He's a good kid.

753
01:29:56,433 --> 01:29:58,350
Yeah, he is.

754
01:30:01,104 --> 01:30:05,316
You know, when l came back,
after my sister died...

755
01:30:06,276 --> 01:30:08,986
...l remember seeing him...

756
01:30:09,863 --> 01:30:14,200
...for the first time in two years
just sitting on the porch.

757
01:30:14,910 --> 01:30:19,455
l drove up crying. l'd been at this...

758
01:30:19,623 --> 01:30:23,959
...party all night in the city
when l got the call...

759
01:30:26,421 --> 01:30:31,300
...so l was wearing
this ridiculous party dress.

760
01:30:33,386 --> 01:30:36,222
All my ridiculous shit.

761
01:30:38,058 --> 01:30:40,518
And l don't know if he...

762
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:44,313
...even remembered me...

763
01:30:45,524 --> 01:30:47,942
...but he looked at me....

764
01:30:54,116 --> 01:30:56,700
l abandoned him.

765
01:30:59,955 --> 01:31:02,665
l abandoned my baby.

766
01:31:07,337 --> 01:31:10,965
And l've seen so many men
in the city...

767
01:31:11,633 --> 01:31:15,719
...who l look in their eyes
and they're just lost.

768
01:31:17,764 --> 01:31:20,349
So whether he loves me back or not...

769
01:31:22,227 --> 01:31:25,729
...as long as l'm there to raise him...

770
01:31:26,857 --> 01:31:29,692
...he's gonna be taken care of.

771
01:31:30,902 --> 01:31:33,529
He's gonna be safe.

772
01:31:35,323 --> 01:31:38,325
He's never gonna get lost.

773
01:32:00,390 --> 01:32:02,141
Hello, Joe.

774
01:32:03,268 --> 01:32:04,894
Jesse.

775
01:32:06,062 --> 01:32:09,732
Put this down and let her go.

776
01:32:10,734 --> 01:32:14,320
Sara, Jesse here is the best shot
with a gat that l know.

777
01:32:15,071 --> 01:32:18,866
When he lets you go, just sit on
the couch. Don't do anything stupid.

778
01:32:24,664 --> 01:32:27,583
He's coming here, Jess.
My loop is coming here.

779
01:32:27,751 --> 01:32:31,629
-l gotta take you in.
-l got 948 bars of pure silver.

780
01:32:31,796 --> 01:32:33,797
l close my loop, l get right with Abe.

781
01:32:33,965 --> 01:32:36,425
Whatever he gives back,
l'll split it with you.

782
01:32:36,593 --> 01:32:38,135
Was that your plan?

783
01:32:39,262 --> 01:32:40,387
Okay, take all of it.

784
01:32:40,555 --> 01:32:43,224
Are you delusional?
You ain't getting right.

785
01:32:43,391 --> 01:32:47,937
Long as Abe's got one gat man standing
he's gonna hunt you until his dying day.

786
01:32:48,605 --> 01:32:52,191
We're gonna go now. Gonna get
in my truck and you're just gonna....

787
01:33:07,123 --> 01:33:08,832
l'm sorry.

788
01:34:11,479 --> 01:34:12,771
The Rainmaker....

789
01:34:36,296 --> 01:34:39,757
Cid!

790
01:34:40,633 --> 01:34:42,384
Oh, my God!

791
01:34:45,263 --> 01:34:47,264
Cid!

792
01:34:49,225 --> 01:34:50,809
Cid?

793
01:34:51,519 --> 01:34:55,105
lt's him. What is he, some TK freak?

794
01:34:55,899 --> 01:34:57,441
You knew.

795
01:34:59,986 --> 01:35:02,363
-What are you doing?
-How did your sister die?

796
01:35:02,530 --> 01:35:06,033
-What are you doing with those guns?
-ls that what happened to her?

797
01:35:06,201 --> 01:35:07,743
-No!
-He kill her like that?

798
01:35:07,911 --> 01:35:11,288
No. He was climbing a bookshelf
and it fell back on him.

799
01:35:11,456 --> 01:35:13,916
He can get scared. lt exploded.

800
01:35:14,084 --> 01:35:16,460
-Jesus frigging--
-He'll learn to control it.

801
01:35:16,628 --> 01:35:20,506
-lmagine what he's gonna do!
-lf he did good with it, though.

802
01:35:20,673 --> 01:35:23,550
lf he grew up with me raising him.

803
01:35:23,718 --> 01:35:25,719
lf he grew up good....

804
01:35:27,389 --> 01:35:28,389
He doesn't.

805
01:35:29,140 --> 01:35:31,517
You stay away from him, Joe!

806
01:35:36,189 --> 01:35:40,317
Cid! Stay away from Joe, baby!

807
01:35:40,819 --> 01:35:42,778
Follow me, baby!

808
01:36:42,797 --> 01:36:44,756
Come to me. lt's okay.

809
01:36:48,720 --> 01:36:51,138
lt's okay, baby.

810
01:36:53,850 --> 01:36:55,684
Right now two things have happened.

811
01:36:55,852 --> 01:36:58,187
My loop knows Cid's the kid
he's looking for.

812
01:36:58,354 --> 01:37:00,105
And my gang knows l'm here.

813
01:37:00,273 --> 01:37:04,151
That means in 1 5 minutes, one or both
of them is coming down that highway.

814
01:37:04,736 --> 01:37:07,446
Pack up the truck.
Take everything you can and go.

815
01:37:07,614 --> 01:37:10,115
Drive north away from the city.

816
01:37:10,783 --> 01:37:12,159
Thank you.

817
01:37:25,215 --> 01:37:27,216
Got everyone here, all our men.

818
01:37:27,383 --> 01:37:29,593
Arm them up. Let's go.

819
01:37:38,228 --> 01:37:39,895
l got him, Abe. l got him.

820
01:37:41,105 --> 01:37:43,607
Well, shit.

821
01:37:46,069 --> 01:37:47,903
That's right, motherfuckers.

822
01:37:49,113 --> 01:37:50,531
l got him.

823
01:37:50,698 --> 01:37:52,658
Knew he was sweet
on this one whore.

824
01:37:52,825 --> 01:37:55,118
-l checked her building--
-They found Joe...

825
01:37:55,286 --> 01:37:58,914
...in a farm on the east side.
That's why all the gat men are here.

826
01:37:59,082 --> 01:38:02,042
The whole crew is arming up
to make a sweep.

827
01:38:02,210 --> 01:38:03,544
Joe?

828
01:38:03,711 --> 01:38:06,755
Fuck Joe. Save your bullets!
l've got the loop!

829
01:38:07,382 --> 01:38:11,051
Not such a fuck-up now, huh?
l'm bringing him up to see Abe.

830
01:38:21,396 --> 01:38:22,604
Get this asshole!

831
01:38:25,358 --> 01:38:26,942
Motherfuckers!

832
01:39:38,806 --> 01:39:40,682
Holy shit.

833
01:39:47,690 --> 01:39:49,441
Joe!

834
01:39:51,235 --> 01:39:54,529
Guess l put the gun
in that kid's hand, huh?

835
01:39:57,200 --> 01:40:00,118
I guess everything
comes back around.

836
01:40:01,704 --> 01:40:04,081
Like your goddamn ties.

837
01:41:28,374 --> 01:41:31,793
Take this truck. And take your gold
and go live your life.

838
01:41:31,961 --> 01:41:35,672
Nobody's coming after you. l fixed it.

839
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:38,091
You go kill the boy.
That how you fix it?

840
01:41:38,259 --> 01:41:40,844
You're goddamn right
l'm gonna kill that boy!

841
01:41:41,012 --> 01:41:44,055
-You just got your life back.
-My life?

842
01:41:44,223 --> 01:41:47,017
Your life. Becoming you.

843
01:41:47,185 --> 01:41:50,020
Goddamn it!
You've lost your fucking mind!

844
01:41:50,188 --> 01:41:54,024
You let this boy live,
he's going to take everything you've got.

845
01:41:54,192 --> 01:41:56,067
And everything l got!

846
01:41:57,069 --> 01:42:00,113
-See what he becomes.
-l haven't seen that yet.

847
01:42:00,281 --> 01:42:01,782
Goddamn it!

848
01:42:53,543 --> 01:42:54,584
Shit.

849
01:42:54,752 --> 01:42:57,212
Okay, baby, we're going.

850
01:42:58,923 --> 01:43:00,507
Put your seat belt on.

851
01:43:27,201 --> 01:43:28,910
-Stop.
-Duck down. lt's okay.

852
01:43:29,078 --> 01:43:31,705
-Stop, please. He can shoot us.
-Duck down.

853
01:43:31,873 --> 01:43:35,250
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

854
01:43:57,064 --> 01:43:59,482
-Cid.
-l'm sorry.

855
01:43:59,650 --> 01:44:03,236
lt's okay. lt's okay.
l'm gonna get you down.

856
01:44:11,996 --> 01:44:15,373
Okay, we're going into the cane.
Go. Go.

857
01:44:21,756 --> 01:44:23,214
Go.

858
01:44:41,275 --> 01:44:42,525
No!

859
01:44:50,576 --> 01:44:53,370
No. Cid, no.

860
01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:43,336
No!

861
01:45:48,592 --> 01:45:52,846
lt's okay, baby. You're okay.

862
01:45:54,765 --> 01:45:56,891
lt's okay, baby.

863
01:46:00,688 --> 01:46:02,772
lt's okay.

864
01:46:02,940 --> 01:46:05,900
l love you. Calm down.

865
01:46:06,569 --> 01:46:08,611
Good boy.

866
01:46:10,614 --> 01:46:18,079
Mommy loves you.

867
01:46:19,373 --> 01:46:21,166
lt's okay.

868
01:46:23,586 --> 01:46:25,420
Mom.

869
01:46:35,181 --> 01:46:36,598
Shit.

870
01:46:40,019 --> 01:46:43,772
You did good. You did so good.
Good boy.

871
01:46:46,817 --> 01:46:49,903
Listen to me. l need you to run
into the fields now.

872
01:46:50,071 --> 01:46:53,740
-No, Mom, l don't want to leave you.
-lt's okay.

873
01:46:53,908 --> 01:46:56,159
-You need to go. Go!
-Move!

874
01:46:56,327 --> 01:46:58,203
Move, goddamn it!

875
01:47:15,137 --> 01:47:16,304
Move.

876
01:47:21,185 --> 01:47:22,685
Then I saw it.

877
01:47:26,941 --> 01:47:30,443
l saw a mom
who would die for her son.

878
01:47:32,613 --> 01:47:34,864
A man who would kill for his wife.

879
01:47:37,910 --> 01:47:40,203
A boy, angry and alone.

880
01:47:41,330 --> 01:47:44,207
Laid out in front of him,
the bad path. l saw it.

881
01:47:46,627 --> 01:47:48,169
And the path was a circle...

882
01:47:51,882 --> 01:47:53,758
...round and round.

883
01:48:04,937 --> 01:48:06,229
So l changed it.

884
01:48:22,204 --> 01:48:23,788
Cid!

885
01:48:47,146 --> 01:48:48,646
Where's Joe?

886
01:48:50,482 --> 01:48:53,109
He had to go away, baby.
