00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:55,072
Huh?

3
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,295
I hate Mondays.

4
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:22,307
Pooky, cover me. I'm going in.

5
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,478
Alley-oop.

6
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,897
Ba-ba-ba-ba...

7
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,816
Ha.

8
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,529
Oh, sleeping beauty, wake up.

9
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:38,740
You can stop dreaming about me,
because l'm here.

10
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:43,495
Nowjust wake up. You've got work to do.

11
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:47,916
You're not just my owner,
you're my primary caregiver, now...

12
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,752
Not now, Garfield.

13
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,463
All right. Cut the sweet stuff. Easy now.

14
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,508
Just... ahh.

15
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:59,219
Trying to cuddle with me, huh?

16
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:02,723
Trying to avoid your duties, huh?

17
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:06,435
Well, that just ain't gonna fly.
lt don't work.

18
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:11,565
See, l'm getting my exercise.
Doing my job.

19
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:14,401
Just one quick... cannonball!

20
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:16,111
- Morning.
- Garfield!

21
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:20,324
Working nine to five

22
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:24,786
OK. l think you're clean enough now.

23
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,290
- Got your towel here.
- Garfield!

24
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:42,262
- lt's liver-flavored.
- Mm.

25
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,890
Delicious. Yeugh.

26
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:49,561
Mm. Mm.

27
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:54,858
Oh. Oh, liver.

28
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:58,654
Well. Actually, it's liver-flavored.

29
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:03,784
Ah, that was a good breakfast.
Now l think l'll just fall off the Catkins diet

30
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:06,495
and get myself a little high-fat chaser.

31
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:09,665
- Mm.
- Garfield, look, the milk truck.

32
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:13,085
Oh, attaboy, Nermal.
The milk truck comes every day.

33
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:16,255
Maybe not today.
Maybe it's changing routes.

34
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,632
Maybe this'll be the last we'll see of it.

35
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:21,760
lt's just across the street.
We're cats, we like milk. Go for it.

36
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:22,844
- No.
- But...

37
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:26,932
"But" nothing.
l don't leave the cul-de-sac for anything.

38
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:29,559
Out there it's a hornet's nest of trouble.

39
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:33,563
Bad things happen out there,
so l don't go out there.

40
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:39,820
Besides, l've found, if you wait
for long enough, everything comes to you.

41
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:43,657
Here come da milkman
Here come da milkman

42
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:45,742
He got his shoes on...

43
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:49,371
- Hey, Nermal, let's play astronaut again.
- Yeah?

44
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:50,914
l love that game.

45
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:53,834
- You're a brave astronaut.
- All right.

46
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:57,921
- Prepare to jump into your spaceship.
- But what about the milk?

47
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:00,674
Who needs milk
when you can be in outer space?

48
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:02,676
- You got a secret mission.
- Yeah?

49
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,886
You'll be exploring the Milky Way.

50
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,931
l get the chills when you jump
in your spacecraft.

51
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:09,391
The nation thanks you.

52
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:11,643
- Prepare to blast off.
- l'm ready to go.

53
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:15,439
- Three, two, one.
- Whoa.

54
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:18,275
- Bon voyage.
- Look at me go!

55
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,819
- Don't look down.
- l'm an eagle flying.

56
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:25,240
- Come to papa, baby.
- l can see everything from here.

57
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,450
l can see my house.

58
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:30,537
- Got milk?
- l can see the whole neighborhood.

59
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:34,249
- That's nice. That's very nice.
- Hey! There's another milk truck.

60
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:38,837
- And that is even nicer.
- l can see... Whoa!

61
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:41,423
- Mission accomplished, Nermal.
- Whoa.

62
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:44,885
Garfield, do it again.
Where did everybody go?

63
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:47,929
You're on the wrong side
of the street, fat cat. Beat it.

64
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:51,475
And you, Luca, the wrong side
of the evolutionary curve.

65
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:54,394
OK, that's it.
You're gonna get it good today.

66
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,938
l make a point to get it good every day.

67
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,566
The question is, how shall l outwit you?

68
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,069
- What?
- Shall l baffle you with simple math?

69
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:03,695
l can spell.

70
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,530
Shall l distract you
with something shiny?

71
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,825
- You're making fun of me.
- l hope so, you're no fun to look at.

72
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,078
You'll never get the best of me.

73
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:14,790
- l think l just did.
- Not the ducks again.

74
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,836
Kiss myself.

75
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:25,258
lf l ever get off this chain,
you're going down.

76
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:29,304
Everybody back up, l don't know
how wild this thing is gonna get.

77
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:35,102
l love the smell of cinnamon apple
in the morning. Smells like... victory.

78
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:37,562
Oh, l hate this fat cat.

79
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:45,362
So much time and so little l need to do.

80
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:51,660
- Mouse!
- No, thanks. l'm full.

81
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:58,333
- Get him, Garfield.
- Get him, Jon.

82
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:09,010
lt's always got to be smashing
and crashing.

83
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:12,556
Nobody poisons anymore.

84
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:14,349
Aha!

85
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:19,271
There's my ball.

86
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:22,441
What good is a cat
that can't chase a mouse?

87
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,568
l don't do the chase thing.

88
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,696
All right. l'll handle this.

89
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:32,534
l know you don't hear me,
but can't you just listen?

90
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:41,835
- What are you doing inside when Jon's in?
- Sorry, Garfield, man. l couldn't help it.

91
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,754
When he sees you,
he expects more from me. Get that?

92
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:48,884
Jon's got those nut cookies.
l'm trying to maintain. Understand?

93
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,553
Sure. As long as you understand
l have to eat you.

94
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:52,679
Aw.

95
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,768
Mm.

96
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:02,564
Mm. Mm.

97
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:05,901
Mm!

98
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:10,113
Oh, good boy. See? l knew you could do it
if you put your mind to it.

99
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:13,408
- You're the best cat a guy could have.
- Mm.

100
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:17,245
Mm. Mm.

101
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,002
Have you tasted yourself lately?

102
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:26,755
lt wasn't the first-class lounge
in there either.

103
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:31,092
Get lost, Louis. Take a powder for a couple
of days. Get a haircut. Grow a beard.

104
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,719
Cool. l owe you one, G.

105
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:36,932
I've got a question for you.
Do you Iove your cat?

106
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:41,019
Finally. Back on my regular schedule.

107
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:44,397
...KibbIy Kat food.
Isn't that right, Persnikitty?

108
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:49,110
That cat's puss is everywhere.
TV, newspapers, T-shirts.

109
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:52,030
Who would want that kind of exposure?

110
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:55,200
Hey, buddy.

111
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:57,953
Yeah, cut the small talk.
What's in the bag?

112
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,706
- Remember, be happy.
- l'm happy when l'm with you,

113
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:06,670
you delicate mélange of tomato paste,
ricotta cheese, ground meat and pasta.

114
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:10,465
Garfield, don't even think about it.
That's my food.

115
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:14,553
- l may just nibble.
- Thanks, Happy.

116
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:18,223
And thank you forjoining us.
I'm Christopher MeIIo. Remember...

117
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:20,642
Be happy.

118
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:24,187
OK, cut.

119
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:25,814
We're clear.

120
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:32,487
Gimme the Benadryl.
Gimme the Benadryl. Yeah. Yeah.

121
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:38,577
Damned cat allergies.

122
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,793
Any word from the network yet?

123
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:49,254
No, but they want a dog act on
Good Day New York.

124
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:54,718
Dog act? Story of my life.
Looking for a dog and l'm stuck with a cat.

125
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:58,305
- The segment went well.
- The segment went well.

126
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:03,184
Of course it went well, you toad.
The 50 housewives who saw it loved it.

127
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:07,689
This is WaIter J. Chapman,
reporting Iive from The Hague.

128
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:11,610
Oh, please. What a know-it-all.

129
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:15,030
And everybody always said
l was the handsome one.

130
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:19,075
l was the smart one. And l was born first.

131
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,328
But there you are "live from The Hague"

132
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:23,538
and here l am working
with this sack of dander

133
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,957
on a dead-end regional morning show.

134
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,083
Back to you, Dan.

135
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:32,297
Garfield!

136
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:36,051
Did you eat all four boxes of lasagne?

137
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,638
lt's not my fault. They started it.

138
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:43,850
- What am l gonna do with you?
- Love me, feed me, never leave me.

139
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:46,478
Let's go for a ride to someplace you love,

140
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:49,314
that always leaves you pampered
and refreshed.

141
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:51,941
Oh, l know, Chuck E Cheese's.

142
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:54,486
Thank you.

143
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,821
No? Wendy's?

144
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,990
Taco Kitty? No?

145
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:02,661
Well, l'm stumped.
Maybe Olive Garden. For you?

146
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:03,787
Hm.

147
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:08,708
The only time l ever leave my cul-de-sac
is when Jon takes me to the vet.

148
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:13,672
Which he's been doing a lot recently, and it
appears to have nothing to do with me.

149
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:17,258
Jon must want to go for his own reason.

150
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:22,681
There's nothing wrong with Garfield.
He's just a happy, fat, lazy cat.

151
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:25,183
- No need for a second opinion.
- l worry about him.

152
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:28,436
l know you do. Ooh.

153
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:31,523
You care about him
more than any owner l've known.

154
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:34,609
"Him" has a name. ls this an HMO?

155
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:38,780
Let's get Garfield in for his dip.
l wanna talk to you. ln private.

156
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:43,618
She's so beautiful.

157
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,705
Mr. Pathetic? You've had a crush
on her since school.

158
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:51,042
Would you please ask her out so she can
reject you and we can get on with my life?

159
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:53,795
l have to ask her out. Wish me luck.

160
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,256
OK. Go get 'em, big tiger.

161
00:11:56,340 --> 00:12:00,468
You the man. You the fella.
You the boss. You preach to her.

162
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:05,724
Show her how the cow eats the cabbage,
you... hopeless loser.

163
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:10,145
Betty, today why don't you start me off
with a Swedish massage,

164
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,313
a manicure and a pedicure, OK?

165
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:18,987
Seaweed wrap, loofah, belly rub, tail
waxing and then crack my toes to finish.

166
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:23,366
Jon, there's something important
l need to ask you.

167
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:26,077
Something l wouldn't ask
most guys that come in.

168
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:29,038
Wait, no.
l think l know where this is going.

169
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,707
- You do?
- l do.

170
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,918
Liz, l've wanted to ask you the same thing
for a long time.

171
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:37,005
- Are we talking about the same thing?
- Absolutely.

172
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,758
l've never been more sure
of anything in my life.

173
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:42,385
Liz, l'm ready to take a chance.

174
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,012
l am ready for...

175
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,767
- Thank you.
- A dog.

176
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:54,230
A do... l'm ready for a dog.

177
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:57,275
- l think he likes you.
- Hi. Yeah.

178
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:58,818
Hi.

179
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:02,071
Oh, he's a frisky little fella, isn't he?

180
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:06,659
His name's Odie and he's not gonna
make it if he has to live his life in a cage.

181
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:09,037
He needs to be loved.

182
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,799
Thank you very much.

183
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:23,718
No, maybe not in my neighborhood.

184
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:27,680
Hey, Boomer, l really got to run.

185
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,724
Gotta fly, everybody. Really.

186
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:33,394
Stay behind the security fence.
lt's great of you to come see me,

187
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:37,106
but l've got somebody waiting,
very devoted, almost crippled.

188
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:40,819
No, please, don't cry.
l know what it's like to be unloved.

189
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:43,196
Well, you do.

190
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,241
l'll come back and visit
and if l don't, l'll try to write.

191
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:50,829
- Does anybody know this guy?
- Bye-bye. Garfield is leaving the building.

192
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:53,998
Jon, you know you don't have
to do this if you don't want to.

193
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,417
No. No, it's OK.

194
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,670
Part of me's always wondered
what it'd be like to have a pet

195
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:01,381
that wants to play with you.

196
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:06,427
- You're a good friend.
- One question. Am l still gorgeous?

197
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:11,516
Jon. l think we've got
a little problem here. Uh, Jon?

198
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,269
And l can help the transition go smoothly.

199
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,187
lt's in my seat.

200
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:20,692
We could all go out together.
Park, dog shows, stuff like that.

201
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:22,193
Jonny boy?

202
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:25,947
Wait a minute, are you... asking me out?

203
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:30,785
Oh, Jonny boy,
the time has come to get a car alarm.

204
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:34,247
You won't believe it.
A mongrel mutt has broken into your car.

205
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:37,083
Garfield, this is Odie.
He's coming home with us.

206
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:40,753
Whoa. You went in there to get a date
and came out with a dog?

207
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:44,048
Well, that's bad even for you.
You're so sad.

208
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:47,886
Oh, no, no, no.
We're not bringing a dog home with us.

209
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:51,180
Hey! l ride shotgun.

210
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,349
What are you looking at, tick boy?

211
00:14:54,685 --> 00:15:00,481
Jon, it's not too late. Quickly. Turn around
before he finds out where we live!

212
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:06,321
Please take this trouser-sniffer back.

213
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,489
- Please?
- Come on, Odie. Let's go.

214
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:11,409
lt's your new home.

215
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,251
- Come on, buddy.
- Jon...

216
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:26,007
You had me, a chick magnet,
and now you got a tick magnet.

217
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:32,889
- Garfield. Jon brought a dog home.
- l am aware, Nermal.

218
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:36,559
- Why would he do a thing like that?
- Gee, l don't know, Nermal.

219
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:38,811
lt just seems like a weird thing to do,

220
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:41,439
bringing a dog into a house
that already has a cat.

221
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:44,108
Can we drop it? l mean, it's no big deal.

222
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:47,487
lt's... just a splattered bug
on the windshield of my life.

223
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:48,655
A bug?

224
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:52,659
A dim-witted, smelly,
goofy splattered bug,

225
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:55,328
to deal with appropriately
and enthusiastically.

226
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:58,623
- Come on!
- As you can see, l'm still Jon's favorite.

227
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:01,626
See you later.
Good luck with the bug thing.

228
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:04,087
Come on.

229
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:08,633
Ha! This is payback for the liver thing,
isn't it?

230
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:11,928
Payback. He's a nut.

231
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:16,015
This is your new home, Odie.
That's my office over there.

232
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,518
And the TV over there.

233
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:20,895
And now, the kitchen. Wanna go see it?

234
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,189
OK. Go see that. Go see.

235
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:26,567
Why don't you draw him a map?

236
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:30,738
OK. l've got to remain calm, that's all.

237
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,199
Jon's a cat guy, not a dog guy.

238
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:36,160
This'll last a week, maybe ten days, tops.

239
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:39,914
Boy, this puppy is Stupid Gone Wild.

240
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,251
This is just a bad dream. l'll close my eyes

241
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:48,089
and when l open them,
everything will be back to normal.

242
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:56,931
That's not normal. Not close.

243
00:16:57,016 --> 00:17:01,644
Oh, great, dog cooties.
Somebody inoculate me, please.

244
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:11,279
This is a nightmare. l just need a little
quality time with man's real best friend.

245
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,656
Television.

246
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:17,201
Heh heh heh.

247
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:21,372
No, no, no!

248
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:24,792
Hey, new guy.
Let me hip you to the rules, OK?

249
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,086
Number one, that's my chair.

250
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:32,467
All right? l even see you raise a leg
and it's on, it's go time, pal.

251
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,055
Very well.

252
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:53,404
Yeah, l think l just may have
a mental advantage on this guy.

253
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,754
Leave me alone.
l'm not kidding, Yodel Odie.

254
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:13,591
Pop a worm pill and hit the road. l'm busy.

255
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:17,386
You want to play? Fine.
You can be my new astronaut.

256
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:22,016
Go jump in the pail and we'll shoot you
into outer space. C'mon, it's real simple.

257
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:26,395
Here. l'll even throw your ball in there.
Follow the ball and jump in the pail.

258
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:28,898
Come on, Odie. Just like this.

259
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:33,194
Come on over here and jump
right into the pail and help me. Come on.

260
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:36,948
No. Just in here, like this.
Uh-oh. Don't touch that.

261
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:39,117
Argh!

262
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:44,872
Oh, no!

263
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,256
Argh!

264
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:54,465
Ah.

265
00:18:58,053 --> 00:18:59,971
Oh, no.

266
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:06,978
Houston, we have a problem.

267
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:10,064
Odie, get off the pail.

268
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,733
Would you get off the pail, please?

269
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,069
OK, time for a new game.

270
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,989
lt's called "My Claw ln Your Butt" game.

271
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:19,991
C'mere. Get back here.

272
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:22,785
Come on. l'll just use my left claw.

273
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:26,164
lf my legs were longer
l'd have caught you by now. C'mere.

274
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:29,917
Just wait for one second. Slow down.

275
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:35,506
Well, well, well. l've got you now, fat cat.

276
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:39,552
Hey, Luca. ls that a new chain
you're wearing, fella?

277
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:41,971
Looks good. You look great.
Been working out?

278
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:46,475
- l've been waiting years for this.
- Would that be regular years or dog years?

279
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:53,649
What the? Get away from me, pipsqueak.
You're nothing but a...

280
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:59,113
Luca, this is Odie. Odie, Luca. Luca, do me
a favor and eat him, would you, please?

281
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,948
Are you all right?

282
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,701
l think so.
Luca's gonna have Odie for lunch.

283
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:06,746
lf it wasn't for Odie,
you'd be Luca's chew toy.

284
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:10,833
Yeah, he saved your life. Odie's a hero!

285
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:15,504
Why? Because l wasn't ripped to shreds?
No. Odie's an imbecile until further notice.

286
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:23,262
Hey, moon dust. lf l were you
l'd grab a nice piece of carpet.

287
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,890
Jon doesn't let me sleep up top. Ever.

288
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,769
Odie.

289
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:33,147
You want to sleep in the bed? OK.

290
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,066
Wh...?

291
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:39,570
Hey, buddy. Good boy.
Who's a good boy, huh?

292
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:43,074
Want to sleep on the bed tonight?
"Yes, l do!"

293
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:46,869
l think l'm going to blow cat chow chunks.

294
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:49,330
G'night, Odie. G'night, Garfield.

295
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:52,041
Great. Wish me luck with the nightmares.

296
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:10,726
Another day ruined.

297
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:22,405
Oh, you little suck-up. Oh.

298
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:29,912
Whoa! Whoa, baby.

299
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,210
No. Down.

300
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,379
Down, dumb dog.

301
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:47,221
What part of "no" don't you understand?
The push off the chair?

302
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:50,308
Off! l don't want to play.

303
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:56,480
Look. What am l supposed to say?
"Thanks for saving my hide with Luca?"

304
00:21:56,565 --> 00:22:00,526
OK, "Thanks for saving my hide
with Luca." Get off!

305
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,903
Where was l? Right here. l was right here.

306
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,573
Whoa!

307
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:09,410
That was a cheap shot.
Hit a guy when he's not looking? OK.

308
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:12,580
Oh, excuse me. l think
you may have forgotten something.

309
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:15,750
l saw this and l thought...
pretty sure it was yours.

310
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:19,211
Oh, l love to dish it out.

311
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:25,092
Watch out. You see?
You can't touch this. Come on. Uh-huh.

312
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:29,096
That's right. Don't sneak up on me, baby.

313
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:32,516
Oh, come on with that.

314
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:35,061
Get that weak stuff out of here.

315
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:39,565
ls that butt broken?
No, it's something like this, here.

316
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:41,984
Can you do this?

317
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:44,445
Shouldn't those hips be in the shop?

318
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:48,741
Walk this way, please. l'm walking the dog.

319
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:52,745
Let's step it up a little bit.
Something like this.

320
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:56,665
Oh, look at this. Watch out now.
Watch out for this thing. lt could go.

321
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:58,501
Uh-huh.

322
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:00,503
You should've practiced in the garage

323
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:03,798
before you stepped up
with someone of my level.

324
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:06,884
Back up.

325
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,719
Maybe something
a little more challenging.

326
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:12,723
Hey! How about this? Out the front door.

327
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:18,062
Look who's here on the porch.

328
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:22,233
l'm walking the porch, holding a torch,
l'm ready to scorch.

329
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:24,610
Uh-huh. That's fancy footwork.

330
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:28,823
Hey. Look, Garfield's dancing with Odie.
They're like buddies now.

331
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,826
What's the matter? Oh, my God.
Odie, what are you doing here?

332
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:35,204
l was doing a solo dance and a creepy dog
comes up next to me.

333
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:36,330
Did you guys see that?

334
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:39,250
Thank you, fellas, thank you. Uh-oh.

335
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,043
Here's more trouble.

336
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:51,345
- Look at the goony look on his face.
- C'mon, buddy. Come here.

337
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,931
Hey, taking him back to the vet?

338
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:55,724
You're taking him
back to the kennel, right?

339
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:56,976
Yeah?

340
00:23:57,060 --> 00:24:00,146
Are you putting him up for adoption?

341
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:05,109
Hey, Garfield. Jon's taking Odie on his date
with Liz and he's leaving you behind.

342
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:06,569
l know, Nermal.

343
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:09,280
They're off on an adventure
and you're here.

344
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:11,157
And your point is?

345
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:16,370
Well, that's gotta feel bad,
being left by Jon while he takes Odie out.

346
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:19,540
lt's like you're not his favorite anymore.

347
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,208
Hey, what do you say we play
brain surgeon?

348
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:24,211
Would you go get my power tools?

349
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:29,550
This is so sad.
Jon has completely lost his mind.

350
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:32,678
Doesn't realize how important l am to him.

351
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:37,516
l need to be so very understanding of him
at this difficult time.

352
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:41,020
Hey, wait up! Wait up for me!
You forgot me!

353
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:43,522
Slow down. Please, slow down.

354
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:46,066
l'm right back here.

355
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:47,943
l think l pulled a hamstring.

356
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:55,242
lt's OK. l'm on. l'm on. Relax.

357
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:01,832
Oh, my poor nose.

358
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:08,506
So, if you own Marine, pIease
come and cIaim her. Thank you very much.

359
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:23,687
Yeah, go on ahead. l'll catch up with you.

360
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:27,900
lt's probably just a mild concussion
or a skull fracture.

361
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:30,069
Maybe l'll get a CAT scan.

362
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,446
A CAT scan.

363
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,658
I'd Iike to ask the judges now if they wouId

364
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:38,619
pIease take their positions
for the viewings.

365
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:41,038
Watch your step there.

366
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:51,382
Ladies and gentIemen.
WeIcome to the dog show.

367
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:56,637
What if l compromised? How about l do
the rolling around with the yarn ball thing?

368
00:25:56,721 --> 00:26:02,184
And l'll purr. l'll purr like a Ferrari.
Or make that a Jaguar.

369
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:06,939
l won't climb drapes. That's more
than you get from some dumb dog.

370
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:09,608
Oops. Dogs. Uh-oh.

371
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:13,988
Oh, what?
You all going to take it personally?

372
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:18,492
Now l'm gonna die.
Oh, no, l really am gonna die!

373
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:22,037
Excuse me. Can l get through here?

374
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:24,123
No one under this tarp.
Argh. That's my ear.

375
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:29,211
Owners, maintain controI of your dogs.
Please. Control those animals now.

376
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:32,298
Music. Music, you idiot.

377
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:38,637
Yeah, play the music.
That's my bad knee. Stop it.

378
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:41,348
All right. Feet, don't fail me now.

379
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:48,606
I apoIogize for this. PIease excuse
this outburst. This is highIy irreguIar.

380
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:50,107
Odie.

381
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:55,362
Odie. Odie, come on.
Come on, buddy. Odie, want a treat, huh?

382
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:59,575
OK. l need a ride.

383
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:02,369
Madam, l'm a cat in trouble,
l'm hitching a ride in your muu-muu.

384
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:05,164
Come on. Let's move.

385
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,791
Go, let's move. Dig, dig.

386
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:11,378
Come on, Pinkie. Move it out. Sorry. Sorry.

387
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,636
Move, move, move, Pinkie.
Move, Pinkie, move.

388
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,015
We certainIy have a new star in the arena.

389
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:26,226
Ladies and gentIemen, this is amazing.

390
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:31,398
Talented little fella, huh?

391
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:37,446
Yah, Pinkie, yah. They're gaining on us,
Pinkie. A cat's life is at stake.

392
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:41,617
Thanks for the ride.

393
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:44,119
Excuse me, ma'am. Please call 91 1 .

394
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:51,418
This is exactly what l deserve anyway.

395
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:54,963
l promise if l survive
l'll never compete with a dog again.

396
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:57,966
OK. You got me.

397
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:01,428
But before l say goodbye...
Oh, isn't this the final irony?

398
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:04,348
Look who's here to witness this.
The mailman!

399
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:06,767
You're so stupid.

400
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:24,535
Odie, come here. That's a good boy.

401
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:28,580
Ladies and gentIemen, Happy Chapman.

402
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:32,960
That is one talented dog.

403
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:39,091
This is exactly the kind of dog
that could have a future in television.

404
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:42,344
Oh, thank you, Mr. Chapman,
but Odie's just my pet.

405
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:44,555
And that's all l really want him to be.

406
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:47,725
- You're kidding?
- No.

407
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:49,351
OK.

408
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:52,146
Well, this is for you.

409
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:56,900
And this is for you. lf you happen
to change your mind, you just ring me up.

410
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:59,236
"Hello? Hello? l changed my mind."

411
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,405
- "l want to be a star."
- OK.

412
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:02,614
- OK.
- OK.

413
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:05,409
Let's hear it for Odie.

414
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:10,414
What a sensationaI ending
to a rather unconventional show.

415
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:16,170
Our winner today,
a fabuIous dancing puppy caIIed Odie.

416
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:20,841
Never leave the cul-de-sac.

417
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:24,219
Never leave the cul-de-sac.
Never leave the cul-de-sac.

418
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:27,389
Never leave the cul-de... Uh.

419
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:30,184
l'm home.

420
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:34,605
- l had fun today. Thank you.
- Yeah, me too.

421
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:37,024
- Would you like to come in?
- Not today.

422
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:40,652
- l knew that. l'm sorry.
- l want to come over, just not today.

423
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:43,030
l have to cover for another vet.

424
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:45,199
Oh. Really?

425
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:47,659
How's Sunday?

426
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:51,455
Sunday's great. Sunday's good. Sunday...

427
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:54,792
OK.

428
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:59,171
So, l'll...

429
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:02,007
- l'll see you Sunday.
- Sunday.

430
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:03,884
Sunday.

431
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:11,850
Why? Why has this happened?
l was the one.

432
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:17,981
lt was all about me, not about
some stupid, sniveling, smelly,

433
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:21,193
high-maintenance disco dog.

434
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:37,084
Oh, no.

435
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:21,879
You can't do this. He's trying
to tear us apart. Don't you see?

436
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:25,048
You know me. l'm too lazy
to try to destroy your house.

437
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:28,468
l was provoked. Pushed.
Prodded. Driven mad.

438
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:32,973
You can't kick me out of my own house
like l'm some kind of animal.

439
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:35,142
Oh, come on, Jon. Jon.

440
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:39,646
You know l'm scared of the dark.

441
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:44,276
That's a good boy.

442
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:48,238
Used to have Jon to myseIf

443
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:52,826
Day or night there was no one eIse

444
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:56,788
From dawn to dusk my meaIs wouId come

445
00:31:56,873 --> 00:32:01,126
I'd Iounge about in my home

446
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:05,339
But now I'm out in the coId of night

447
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:09,343
AII aIone tiII the dawn's first Iight

448
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:16,683
I'm in a new dog state of mind

449
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:26,526
Used to think l had a home

450
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:30,989
A speciaI pIace to caII my own

451
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:34,868
But now the dog's in and I'm out

452
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:40,415
I've got no Jon, I've got no cIout

453
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:56,098
I'm in a new dog state of mind

454
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:06,733
Leave me alone. You've won.

455
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:11,405
You're inside with him
and l'm out here all by myself.

456
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:40,434
Odie. You came out here to be with me?

457
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:42,644
l'm touched.

458
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:46,481
And you must be touched in the head.

459
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:48,734
Kick out the dog, bring in the cat

460
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:51,111
Yakety-yak, don't taIk back

461
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:53,321
See you in the morning, little fella.

462
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:58,201
You know, a puppy needs
a little tough love every now and then.

463
00:33:58,286 --> 00:34:00,579
l think it builds character.

464
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:03,081
Hello, Pooky. Miss me?

465
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:06,460
You know what?
l'm gonna make it up to Odie tomorrow.

466
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:09,171
l'm gonna teach him
how to drink out of the toilet.

467
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:15,177
- Poor Odie. That cat is such a pig.
- Garfield's a pig?

468
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:18,138
- You never put the dog out at night.
- Why not?

469
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:21,892
Because dogs... run away.

470
00:35:46,727 --> 00:35:52,524
Sure, Jon,
l'll eat all your lasagne for you.

471
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:02,576
Oh, look. What do we have here?

472
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:05,912
You're a lost dog.

473
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,002
Well, we can fix that.

474
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:19,509
Oh, do l feel good this morning.

475
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:25,432
l slept like a fat cat. Hey, tall, dark
and human, what's for breakfast?

476
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:28,143
Odie. Where are you, boy?

477
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:31,688
Oh, relax. l think he was gonna camp out.

478
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:33,648
Odie?

479
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:37,944
Well, probably had
a sleepover at Luca's, l think.

480
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:43,491
Odie?

481
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:44,743
Hm.

482
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:50,290
Well, maybe he's fetching the paper
for the neighbors.

483
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:52,125
Where is that silly dog?

484
00:36:56,797 --> 00:37:01,343
l can't go on like this anymore, Wendell.
l've got to get a dog.

485
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:03,428
That's a lovely idea.

486
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:06,473
You've been lonely since the divorce,
and l've tried to be a friend...

487
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:09,517
Not for me, you imbecile. For the act.

488
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:13,563
lf l could get my hands on
a really talented dog,

489
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:17,067
wouldn't Walter J just choke on his Emmy?

490
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:19,778
- Like Odie?
- Yeah.

491
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:22,989
Yeah, now he was good.

492
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,616
Oh, yeah.

493
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:28,370
He was kinda dopey-looking and spry and...

494
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:29,829
Lost.

495
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:40,757
It's Jon. I was just caIIing to see
if Odie's been over. l can't find him.

496
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:43,927
My name is Jon ArbuckIe
and I can't find my dog.

497
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:46,513
Looked around and l can't find him...

498
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:49,516
l haven't seen him.
If you see him, give me a caII.

499
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:53,895
Hi, it's Jon. I was caIIing to see
if you'd seen Odie. I think he's run away.

500
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:57,357
I gave him a bath and I forgot to put
his collar back on.

501
00:37:57,817 --> 00:37:59,442
Well, cos Garfield hates his collar.

502
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:03,363
He's about 1 5 pounds, brownish-yellow
with brown floppy ears...

503
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:08,618
- Would you mind getting that?
- l'm offering a reward.

504
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:12,414
Yeah, that's right.
OK, and he answers to the name of...

505
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,958
- Hi.
- Hi.

506
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:17,877
l'd say the refrigerator is unguarded.

507
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:22,966
- What are you doing here?
- We're having dinner, remember?

508
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:26,303
Right. Dinner. The two of us.

509
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:29,639
Tonight. Of course.

510
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:33,643
- Shall l come in?
- Yeah. Yeah, come on in.

511
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:38,565
You know, Liz, l have a confession.

512
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:41,818
lt's not really a confession,
it's more of an admission.

513
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:45,488
lt's... You know what it is,
it's like a declaration.

514
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:48,867
- l have a...
- l love it when you do that.

515
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:52,329
- Do what?
- You know. Trip over yourself.

516
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:57,709
lt's cute. And it's one of the reasons
l had a crush on you in high school.

517
00:38:57,793 --> 00:38:59,961
- You had a crush on me?
- Yeah.

518
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:04,466
l thought you were really cute.
Decent, not like all those otherjerks.

519
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:06,968
l don't believe it. l had a crush on you too.

520
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:10,013
- lsn't that funny?
- Yeah.

521
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:12,515
Hilarious.

522
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:17,103
So, what's your
confession-admission-declaration?

523
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:19,981
Actually, um...

524
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:24,778
l forgot about our dinner. Yeah.

525
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:30,325
- That's OK. l can go.
- No, no, l'm glad you're here.

526
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:34,287
Let me just get my jacket
and then we'll go.

527
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:42,045
What am l gonna do?
What am l gonna do? What...

528
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:45,799
What am l gonna do?
l've waited for tonight my entire life.

529
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:50,428
lf you tell her the truth, you'll feel better.
And you won't have to see her anymore.

530
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:53,765
lt's kinda creepy having a vet
around the house anyway.

531
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:56,267
l can't pretend like nothing's happened,
can l?

532
00:39:56,352 --> 00:40:00,605
Well, l sure could. The one thing
you can't do is tell her the dog's gone.

533
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:03,149
- l gotta tell her.
- No.

534
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:07,153
- Gotta tell her.
- No. That's not what l said.

535
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:08,363
Schmuck.

536
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,992
- Liz, we can't go out tonight.
- Why not?

537
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,161
- Odie's run away.
- What?

538
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:17,622
He got out last night. l called the pound.

539
00:40:17,706 --> 00:40:21,209
l put up posters.
l looked everywhere, but l can't find him.

540
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:24,337
- Why didn't you just tell me?
- l guess l figured

541
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:27,298
he was the only reason
you were spending time with me.

542
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:30,135
- Come on.
- No, serious. l-l...

543
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:33,555
No. l mean, "Come on, let's go find him."

544
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:34,889
Oh.

545
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:41,563
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay.

546
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:46,985
How can this dog be such a problem
when he's not even here anymore?

547
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:48,945
Well, l'm not gonna worry about him.

548
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:51,406
l believe you found my dog.

549
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:54,868
- He answers to "Odie".
- Odie?

550
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:56,786
Family name.

551
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,373
Oh! Odie!

552
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:03,251
Oh, come on! There you are.

553
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:05,378
Ah. Oh.

554
00:41:06,922 --> 00:41:11,217
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

555
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:13,511
l can live again now.

556
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:18,266
- How can l ever repay you?
- An autograph would be splendid.

557
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:20,852
Then splendid it shall be.

558
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:23,897
Hmm.

559
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:25,565
No.

560
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:32,739
Hmm...

561
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:38,119
This is ridiculous.

562
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:42,499
- What are you looking at?
- Just looking for some company.

563
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:45,126
- Keep walking, creepo.
- What's going on?

564
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:48,671
We know how much you hated Odie
and how much you wanted him gone.

565
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:51,424
Wait. All l wanted
was to sleep in my own bed.

566
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:54,385
To do it you cast Odie out
into the cold, cruel world.

567
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:56,846
We saw you lock Odie outside last night.

568
00:41:56,931 --> 00:42:01,684
l don't believe you guys. l didn't know
he was gonna run away. He's a dumb dog.

569
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:03,895
- No offense, Luca.
- Uh, what?

570
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:07,023
- You can't blame me.
- Any one of us could be next.

571
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:11,110
Yeah. There's no room
for anybody else in Garfield's world.

572
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:13,696
Huh? That's a little dramatic.

573
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:17,033
Well, l may have been a little tough
about protecting my turf,

574
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:20,662
but... l don't hate the guy.

575
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:26,042
I understand Happy has a big surprise
for us. What have you got for us, Hap?

576
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:28,878
Guten Morgen, Chris. Yeah, yeah, ja.

577
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:31,464
I have been working
with a speciaI new friend,

578
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:35,426
and l would like to
introduce him to aII of you.

579
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:38,846
Odie Schnitzel.

580
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:43,351
Looky here. lt's Odie.

581
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:48,898
He's safe and sound. Although he seems
to have found an alternative lifestyle.

582
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:52,694
He still can't dance. This gets me
off the hook with Jon and the gang.

583
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,696
Now, l'm gonna be the hero.

584
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:57,073
That's one taIented dog.

585
00:42:57,157 --> 00:43:01,202
I'm gIad you think so, Chris,
because l have a little announcement.

586
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:03,580
OId Happy Chapman and Odie SchnitzeI

587
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:04,747
are gonna be cIimbing aboard

588
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:08,626
that New Amsterdam Limited
bound to New York City,

589
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:11,462
where we have the opportunity
to be reguIar contributors

590
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:13,506
on "Good Day New York".

591
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:16,509
Huh? That's his last name, "Schnitzel"?

592
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:19,554
Thank you for your help yesterday.
You were great.

593
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:22,932
Jon, Odie's on TV,
and he's wearing lederhosen.

594
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:25,351
l'm sorry. Garfield, not now.

595
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:30,106
l upped the reward to... $200 and
l'm gonna put up some more posters to...

596
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:33,359
He's clog dancing, l think,
wearing lederhosen.

597
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:36,654
- l'm sorry. Garfield, not now.
- You're gonna miss it.

598
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:40,617
l'm sorry, Liz. l'll call you later.
Garfield's being... Garfield.

599
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:46,289
Do l have to bark like Lassie? Come on,
humor me, would you? Arf, arf, arf.

600
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:50,627
Quickly. While we're young.
Today. Let's go.

601
00:43:51,086 --> 00:43:52,545
Be happy.

602
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:58,551
You're gonna miss this. He's the small
one, the small one in the guy's hand.

603
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:00,011
Garfield...

604
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:02,930
l'm not in the mood.

605
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:06,267
You know, it's never good
when you turn off my TV,

606
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:08,394
and this may be the worst ever.

607
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:14,859
Odie's not ready. He's months
of reinforcement away from consistency.

608
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:25,912
Happy, you promised you'd never use that.
That collar is inhumane.

609
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:31,334
This collar is the dog's future.

610
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:35,505
Do you have a problem with that?

611
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:37,674
- No.
- No?

612
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:41,594
Now we'll see how smart you really are.

613
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:47,767
Happy Chapman. Happy Chapman. Happy...

614
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:50,061
Not now, Garfield.

615
00:44:50,145 --> 00:44:53,398
Jon, you're... denser than ever.

616
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:55,650
l gotta think outside the box.

617
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:57,819
Hey, the box.

618
00:44:57,945 --> 00:44:59,987
Wait a second.

619
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:05,326
My box... my box had something on it.

620
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:09,997
Let's see. Apple Jacks. Frosted Flakes.
Cocoa Puffs. Kibbly Kat.

621
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:13,626
Yes. There it is. Telegraph Tower.

622
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:17,964
That's where they make
The Happy Chapman Show. Yeah.

623
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:24,220
But how far away can that be?
Maybe... a paw? Paw and a half, maybe?

624
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:26,389
This is a done deal. l can do this!

625
00:45:28,642 --> 00:45:31,352
No, can't do this.

626
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:33,563
Reached physical limits.

627
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:36,858
Shouldn't have tried it without snacks.

628
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:38,985
Must go back and reload.

629
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:53,875
And that's a sign that the tank is full.

630
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:58,963
l can do this. Beyond this intersection
is just another intersection.

631
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:04,051
And another. And then another. l wonder
if there's any meat loaf left in the fridge.

632
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:06,721
No. Now's not the time
for a plate of meat loaf.

633
00:46:06,805 --> 00:46:09,265
Now's the time for a plate of courage.

634
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:14,604
Ladies and gentlemen,
Garfield has left the cul-de-sac.

635
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:26,324
He is trampIing out the vintage
where the grapes of wrath are stored

636
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:33,915
Now, that's more my style.

637
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:35,500
Oh, taxi.

638
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:38,711
Step on it, will you, driver?

639
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:47,261
No, Odie's not a hound dog.

640
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:48,846
Yes, l'm sure.

641
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:52,892
No, l don't want another dog.
Thanks, anyway.

642
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:55,144
Garfield, lunchtime.

643
00:46:56,813 --> 00:46:59,649
l made your favorite, lasagne.

644
00:47:03,695 --> 00:47:08,950
Garfield!

645
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:11,786
Garfield, where are you?

646
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:22,046
Can anyone direct me to the pink building
that's shown on the Kibbly Kat box?

647
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:26,300
lt's the one right by the
blue and orange tree.

648
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:31,389
Well, this doesn't feel pink building-ish.

649
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:36,102
Hello? Hello? Uh-oh.

650
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:40,314
Rats? Rats the size of... rats.

651
00:47:42,484 --> 00:47:45,111
Why am l being surrounded here?

652
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:47,905
Some of my best friends are vermin.

653
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:51,701
- Finally, some meat.
- Meat? No, it's not meat.

654
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:55,997
They measured it - it's 1 00 per cent
body fat, no nutritional value.

655
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:59,417
- Body fat's good with us.
- Mmm.

656
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:01,085
- Garfield.
- Louis.

657
00:48:01,169 --> 00:48:03,087
What's going on here?

658
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:06,966
- Louis, l got 3,000 teeny mouths to feed.
- Back off.

659
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:10,595
- Garfield? What are you doing here?
- Besides defending my life?

660
00:48:10,929 --> 00:48:15,099
Jon got a dog. Dog got kidnapped
by a TV star. l'm trying to rescue him.

661
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:17,435
Seems like you got yourself in a jam.

662
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:19,395
Wish there was something
l could do to help.

663
00:48:19,479 --> 00:48:22,690
Louis, l think you and l have
an account still. Remember?

664
00:48:22,774 --> 00:48:25,776
- Macadamia-nut cookies?
- l do love the macadamia.

665
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:31,282
Sorry, rat pack, this cat's with me.
Y'all gotta roll. Go ahead, roll out.

666
00:48:31,366 --> 00:48:34,285
Who wants to go to the Red Lobster alley?

667
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:39,040
Maybe next time, little critters. Good luck
with the plague and rabies and everything.

668
00:48:39,124 --> 00:48:42,293
Don't push your luck, fat cat.

669
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:45,296
You can't just be wandering
around the city.

670
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:50,468
There are dangers everywhere.
Pot holes. Subways. Animal control.

671
00:48:50,552 --> 00:48:52,803
Can you get me to Telegraph Tower?

672
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:56,307
Two more cookies and you got a deal.
But keep it on the down low.

673
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:58,309
How "down low" do we have to go?

674
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:03,773
- Yo, Garfield, you with me?
- This is a little bit lower than l expected.

675
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:06,817
lf l didn't have a box over my head
l'd be humiliated.

676
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:12,031
OK. Hold up. All right, we're almost there.

677
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:15,284
When l give you the signal,
we gotta cross the street.

678
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:19,580
- Way over there, by the horizon?
- Come on, Garfield, let's go.

679
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:21,582
Wait up! Wait up.

680
00:49:26,838 --> 00:49:28,381
Am l dead?

681
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:32,593
- Garfield, don't move.
- Don't move? Not a problem.

682
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:35,763
Just wait for the walk signal.

683
00:49:36,598 --> 00:49:40,476
Oh, no. lt's a stampede. Stampede!

684
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:44,313
- lf l could just get away from this herd.
- Garfield!

685
00:49:44,398 --> 00:49:46,357
Garfield!

686
00:49:46,441 --> 00:49:49,568
Garfield, where are you?

687
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:53,656
- Garfield, get down from there, man.
- No, l'm not coming down.

688
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:56,784
l'm happy to live the rest of my life
up here. Thank you.

689
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:04,500
Liz! Liz.

690
00:50:04,584 --> 00:50:07,128
- What's wrong?
- Garfield's run away.

691
00:50:07,212 --> 00:50:10,339
First Odie, now Garfield.
l am the worst pet owner ever.

692
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:12,633
- What happened?
- l can't find him.

693
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:14,510
l can't live without Garfield.

694
00:50:14,594 --> 00:50:16,887
Let's start at the park.

695
00:50:17,472 --> 00:50:20,307
Are we there yet?
Are we there yet? Are we there yet?

696
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:22,810
Are we there yet? Are we there yet?
Are we there yet?

697
00:50:22,894 --> 00:50:25,771
Garfield, relax. Look, we're here.

698
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:28,441
- We're here now?
- Curb service.

699
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:32,069
The Telegraph Tower in all its splendor.

700
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:39,535
- lt looks smaller on the box.
- You gotta go all the way up there?

701
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:43,038
Good luck. l'll catch you later.
l don't do the vertical thing.

702
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:45,374
- Thanks a lot, partner.
- Hold up, G.

703
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:47,793
- What?
- Watch out for the po-po.

704
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:50,463
- You know, five-oh. Control-oh.
- Huh?

705
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:53,758
- Animal control, man.
- Oh, that po-po.

706
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:56,218
- Keep it squeal.
- OK. Thanks, partner.

707
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:58,679
Oink, oink.

708
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:03,267
l can't try the door.
l couldn't handle another stampede.

709
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:09,774
Hey.

710
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:15,029
First thing Monday morning,

711
00:51:15,113 --> 00:51:19,909
l'm gonna get to work
on losing those last... 20 pounds.

712
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:27,583
OK. Everything looks good out there.

713
00:51:27,667 --> 00:51:31,420
Looks like we got ourselves a blockage.

714
00:51:38,303 --> 00:51:41,388
Guess we'll just purge the system.

715
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:55,361
Pardon me.
That wasn't my stomach, was it?

716
00:51:56,738 --> 00:51:59,448
There's a cooling breeze.

717
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:11,252
Weeeee.

718
00:52:19,177 --> 00:52:20,594
Oh!

719
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:22,763
My poor nose.

720
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:27,059
Jon, stop the car.

721
00:52:32,774 --> 00:52:34,900
- What?
- lt's Odie.

722
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:38,028
Somebody found him. 52903 Euclid Street.

723
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:40,322
Let's go.

724
00:52:41,366 --> 00:52:45,536
Odie! Odie.

725
00:52:46,913 --> 00:52:51,750
Odster. Od-man.

726
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:56,547
This rescue thing is exhausting.
When do heroes get to eat?

727
00:52:57,591 --> 00:53:00,467
Oh, my! lt's Odie.

728
00:53:04,222 --> 00:53:07,850
O-o-o-o-o-o-o-die!

729
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:12,313
l found you.
l'm so sorry l got you into this mess.

730
00:53:12,397 --> 00:53:14,857
Look, we kinda got off on the wrong paw,

731
00:53:14,941 --> 00:53:20,112
but you can be really annoying sometimes
and you don't give me enough space.

732
00:53:20,196 --> 00:53:22,531
And you're a major-league suck-up.

733
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:26,952
But we have a common purpose,
we share Jon.

734
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:32,291
Jon needs us even more.
And l kinda want you back home too.

735
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:35,294
So stand back.

736
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:37,129
l almost got...

737
00:53:37,213 --> 00:53:41,884
Hurry up, Wendell.
Fortune waits for no man.

738
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:49,642
- You think he's ready for the audition?
- Well, why don't you see for yourself?

739
00:53:49,935 --> 00:53:52,728
Come on, Odie. Show time.

740
00:53:54,856 --> 00:53:57,107
Now...

741
00:53:57,192 --> 00:53:58,692
Ah.

742
00:53:58,777 --> 00:54:02,696
Good morning, New York.
l know you're gonna flip for Odie because...

743
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:04,907
he sure is flipping for you.

744
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:10,704
- Ride 'em, cowboy.
- A shock collar?

745
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:13,332
That's... that's inhumane.

746
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:16,335
Oh, gosh. Hot doggie.

747
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:20,255
So, when does our train leave?

748
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:23,175
- Two hours.
- Tickets?

749
00:54:23,259 --> 00:54:25,344
Chop chop.

750
00:54:27,472 --> 00:54:29,181
Poor Odie.

751
00:54:29,265 --> 00:54:34,311
He faces a future of torture,
neglect and degradation.

752
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:37,606
Nobody gets to mistreat
my dog like that except me.

753
00:54:42,904 --> 00:54:43,988
Psst.

754
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,616
l'll be right behind you, little buddy.

755
00:55:01,214 --> 00:55:03,340
Surf's up.

756
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:07,094
Gravity, do your th-i-i-i-i-ng!

757
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:18,772
Whoa.

758
00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:21,108
Housekeeping at 1 2 o'clock!

759
00:55:21,192 --> 00:55:22,484
Whoa!

760
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:26,488
You know, l think l had
a nightmare like this once.

761
00:55:41,254 --> 00:55:46,592
Once again my life has been saved
by the miracle of lasagne.

762
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:51,055
l said limo, not taxi.
Do you know the difference?

763
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:53,223
Odie! Here l come.

764
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:56,101
Don't worry, fella. l'll rescue you.

765
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:59,688
- Halt! Got you!
- Whoa! Huh?

766
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:02,066
Well, what have we got here?

767
00:56:02,275 --> 00:56:05,110
Looks like we got us a cat with no tags.

768
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:09,698
McGillicuddy, there's an animal
felony happening right behind you.

769
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:12,910
l'm trying to do some
rescue work here, pal.

770
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:18,123
- Welcome to my world.
- l'm gonna call somebody.

771
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:24,046
This is police brutality. l have tags.
l just left them in my other fur.

772
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:26,215
This is abusive, now. This is abuse.

773
00:56:26,299 --> 00:56:28,967
- ln you go, big fella.
- Huh?

774
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:32,429
- What is with the cage?
- OK. Lock it down.

775
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:36,600
Now, this is is insulting.
You know l'm house-trained.

776
00:56:36,768 --> 00:56:41,021
- Settle down, people.
- l ought to give you a bunch of fives, pal.

777
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:43,941
This is all a terrible mistake.

778
00:56:44,025 --> 00:56:48,946
l was trying to save a friend
that's not very smart, needed my help.

779
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:53,617
l don't belong in here.
l have an owner. l'm not a stray.

780
00:56:54,702 --> 00:56:56,745
- Hi. l'm Jon Arbuckle.
- Hi.

781
00:56:56,830 --> 00:57:00,582
- l think you have my dog Odie.
- l think you're mistaken.

782
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:05,295
- No. l saw the flyer. Odie's my dog.
- No. He's Happy Chapman's dog.

783
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:08,132
Happy Chapman?

784
00:57:08,633 --> 00:57:12,219
The gentleman with the cat on Channel 37.

785
00:57:12,303 --> 00:57:14,930
He came and took Odie home.

786
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:19,393
"Odie" is a family name, you know.

787
00:57:19,477 --> 00:57:21,895
- Well, good day.
- Wait a min...

788
00:57:23,481 --> 00:57:27,276
Happy Chapman took Odie?
Think he's got Garfield too?

789
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:30,320
l don't know. But we're gonna find out.

790
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:35,951
Swing Iow, sweet chariot

791
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:38,453
Shut up!

792
00:57:39,497 --> 00:57:44,960
Coming for to carry me home

793
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:47,504
Could you please be quiet?

794
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:51,216
Guard, guard. This really is too much.

795
00:57:51,384 --> 00:57:55,971
Persnikitty, Happy Chapman's cat,
what are you doing in here?

796
00:57:56,055 --> 00:58:00,767
l was his cat, until l outlived my purpose.

797
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:05,022
Then he replaced me with a dog
and dumped me in this wretched place.

798
00:58:05,231 --> 00:58:10,402
- All humans are the same.
- Not Jon, my owner. No way.

799
00:58:10,528 --> 00:58:14,448
He only does what's best for me.
He puts up with me and he feeds me.

800
00:58:14,532 --> 00:58:17,576
And lets you vacation
in this charming pound. Hello.

801
00:58:18,077 --> 00:58:21,580
- Not for long, Persnikitty.
- Would you just stop calling me that?

802
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:24,291
My name isn't really Persnikitty.

803
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:27,002
- lt's Sir Roland.
- Sir Roland?

804
00:58:27,086 --> 00:58:30,088
Yes. Another one
of Happy Chapman's acts of cruelty.

805
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:32,841
l was trained in the classical theater.
Uh-huh.

806
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:39,181
But now l'm a celebrity cable cast-off cat,
with a name l can never live down.

807
00:58:39,265 --> 00:58:44,353
This may hurt a little. l'm trying to rescue
the dog that replaced you, Persnikitty.

808
00:58:44,437 --> 00:58:48,690
l mean, Roland. Happy and Odie are
getting on a train in less than two hours

809
00:58:48,816 --> 00:58:51,652
to become regulars
on Good Day New York.

810
00:58:51,736 --> 00:58:54,905
Wait a minute. Did l just hear that right?

811
00:58:55,114 --> 00:58:58,492
You're a cat that's trying to rescue a dog?

812
00:58:58,576 --> 00:59:01,703
lt true. l know, it's a crime against nature.

813
00:59:02,163 --> 00:59:05,415
At first l thought he was a pain,
but he's grown on me,

814
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:08,543
like a wart you want to have removed
until you realize

815
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:11,004
it defines you in some funny way.

816
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:14,299
Do you know, that is absolutely charming?

817
00:59:14,592 --> 00:59:19,221
Let me ask you a question, chubby.
What are you talking about?

818
00:59:19,305 --> 00:59:23,183
How could you understand?
He's my friend.

819
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:26,144
My gosh. How low have l sunk?

820
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:29,314
Guard, may l have some shoelaces, please?

821
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:34,027
Well, hello there.
Right on time. Nice to see you.

822
00:59:34,112 --> 00:59:37,239
l need a five-cat line-up right now.
Move, move, move.

823
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:39,574
- What's going on?
- Adoption.

824
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:41,285
One of us is getting out of here.

825
00:59:41,369 --> 00:59:45,872
So, you're here to look at a cat.
Let's see if we can't take care of it.

826
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:47,165
Careful.

827
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:50,961
- Let's go. Let's hurry it up.
- Your hands are freezing.

828
00:59:51,045 --> 00:59:55,173
Come on, you newbie.
This might be your lucky day.

829
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:59,594
Come on. There you go.
Oh! You are a heavy one.

830
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:04,182
Excuse me, muscle weighs
more than fat. Check this.

831
01:00:06,602 --> 01:00:08,020
There you go.

832
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:13,317
All right, slide it up.
Paws on the white line. Tails in the air.

833
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:17,571
l don't need to be adopted, guys.
My guy Jon is coming to get me, l'm sure.

834
01:00:17,655 --> 01:00:19,448
- That one.
- Really.

835
01:00:19,532 --> 01:00:23,577
She picked me! She picked me.
She did. She picked me. She picked me.

836
01:00:23,661 --> 01:00:28,290
Not that one. That one.
The one that looks like the cat on TV.

837
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:30,792
Back it up, Red. She went with Trigger.

838
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:33,545
Sorry, love. Better luck next time.

839
01:00:33,629 --> 01:00:35,964
Now, you be careful.

840
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:38,342
That's sore. Ow!

841
01:00:38,426 --> 01:00:40,260
Jon's gonna be here in five minutes.

842
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:41,845
When l give the signal,

843
01:00:41,929 --> 01:00:43,847
- run like a mad cow.
- What?

844
01:00:43,931 --> 01:00:46,308
- Don't you want to save your friend?
- Run?

845
01:00:46,392 --> 01:00:47,768
Now!

846
01:00:47,852 --> 01:00:50,437
Eat hairball, Happy Chapman.

847
01:00:50,521 --> 01:00:52,647
Not the red button.

848
01:00:52,732 --> 01:00:57,611
Once more unto the breach,
dear friends, once more.

849
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:04,659
Go, go, go. The door!

850
01:01:04,744 --> 01:01:07,245
Run, run. Go, go. Get the door.

851
01:01:09,874 --> 01:01:14,211
- Wait. There's a fire hydrant.
- Don't stop! Don't stop!

852
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:23,678
Code blue, code blue. We got runners.

853
01:01:23,763 --> 01:01:27,641
Halt! Stop!
You have not been cleared for release.

854
01:01:57,797 --> 01:02:01,425
- Garfield's been here.
- Excuse me, can l help you guys?

855
01:02:01,509 --> 01:02:05,720
- We're looking for Happy Chapman.
- He's on his way to the train station.

856
01:02:05,805 --> 01:02:09,933
Do you guys have a pass, or something?
l'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

857
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:11,143
Thanks.

858
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:18,483
Excuse me.

859
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:20,485
Your attention, pIease.

860
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:26,700
The New Amsterdam Limited
is now boarding on pIatform 12.

861
01:02:26,784 --> 01:02:32,706
All aboard!

862
01:02:38,546 --> 01:02:43,049
Good afternoon, gentlemen. What will
you be having? Salmon, steak or lasagne?

863
01:02:43,134 --> 01:02:46,136
Steak. l hate lasagne.

864
01:02:46,387 --> 01:02:50,932
Beep beep. Cat coming through.
Beep beep. Going through the tunnel.

865
01:02:51,017 --> 01:02:53,185
- A cat!
- l just had to do that.

866
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:56,646
Final call for
the New Amsterdam Limited.

867
01:02:56,731 --> 01:03:02,319
The New Amsterdam Limited
is now departing from pIatform 12.

868
01:03:02,695 --> 01:03:05,572
No. Wait, please. Stop.

869
01:03:05,656 --> 01:03:09,075
Wait. Don't... No. Oh!

870
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:11,411
You monster, Chapman.

871
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:16,082
l can't outrun a train. Whoa.

872
01:03:16,167 --> 01:03:19,044
Watch the train, pal.

873
01:03:19,253 --> 01:03:20,504
Hey.

874
01:03:20,588 --> 01:03:24,549
l got it. lt's just a train set, only bigger.

875
01:03:26,677 --> 01:03:30,597
- Oh, no. We're too late.
- No. We're gonna stop that train.

876
01:03:30,681 --> 01:03:32,516
Come on.

877
01:03:33,184 --> 01:03:39,606
Somewhere around here there's gotta
be a big table with all the trains on it.

878
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:49,157
He looks like the type.

879
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:53,662
And this must be where
he's got his little table.

880
01:03:55,122 --> 01:03:58,250
l'm sorry.
There's no way to stop that train.

881
01:03:58,334 --> 01:04:00,919
You don't understand.
You have to stop that train.

882
01:04:01,003 --> 01:04:02,712
My dog and my cat are on that train.

883
01:04:04,131 --> 01:04:07,425
l suppose if Jon can do this, l can.

884
01:04:11,597 --> 01:04:15,850
OK. We gotta find our train.
Let's see what happens when l do this.

885
01:04:18,563 --> 01:04:21,022
Boston express, switching to...

886
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:25,402
Well, l'm sorry. Folks in Boston
are gonna be a little late today.

887
01:04:26,153 --> 01:04:27,737
Ah.

888
01:04:28,864 --> 01:04:31,658
Let's see what happens when l do this.

889
01:04:31,742 --> 01:04:36,371
- Warning, SeattIe Wind...
- l don't care about Seattle.

890
01:04:36,455 --> 01:04:38,206
Warning. CoIIision...

891
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:41,001
l'm looking for one train in particular.

892
01:04:41,085 --> 01:04:44,045
Just one second,
l'm trying to find my friend.

893
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:48,133
- The New Amsterdam...
- There's the Amsterdam.

894
01:04:50,261 --> 01:04:52,721
Warning. CoIIision 20 seconds.

895
01:04:52,805 --> 01:04:54,180
Gosh, you sound like my mother.

896
01:04:56,058 --> 01:04:59,436
- Hold up. Everybody stop.
- Ten seconds. Warning.

897
01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:06,109
- Five. Four.
- Stop what you're doing.

898
01:05:06,193 --> 01:05:08,778
- Stop. Stop, stop, stop.
- AII stop.

899
01:05:14,619 --> 01:05:18,747
Yeah! OK, everybody,
let's take it from the top. OK?

900
01:05:22,668 --> 01:05:24,461
- You have to stop that train.
- Hold on.

901
01:05:27,006 --> 01:05:29,799
l'll be down to meet you
at the station, Odie.

902
01:05:30,301 --> 01:05:34,429
Actually, that train has stopped.
lt's returning to the station.

903
01:05:35,973 --> 01:05:38,350
Are we on the right train?

904
01:05:47,026 --> 01:05:48,443
Where are ya?

905
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:53,823
l think l recognize that whine.

906
01:05:58,829 --> 01:06:00,789
Hey, come on.

907
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:06,836
See, these are the kinds of seats you get
when you book at the last minute.

908
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:10,965
Good to see you, partner.

909
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:18,390
- Let's get out of here.
- Your attention, pIease.

910
01:06:19,058 --> 01:06:23,520
The New Amsterdam Limited is making
an unscheduIed stop on pIatform 12.

911
01:06:24,855 --> 01:06:29,192
- Sir, please take your seat.
- My future is running away from me.

912
01:06:33,364 --> 01:06:36,282
Please, stay calm.
Go back to your seats.

913
01:06:58,723 --> 01:07:03,476
Would you slow down? l've been doing
this running thing all day and l am over it.

914
01:07:03,561 --> 01:07:06,312
We're... we're safe now. We're free.

915
01:07:06,397 --> 01:07:09,357
Oh, if it isn't "Unhappy Chappy".

916
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:11,818
Going somewhere?

917
01:07:13,028 --> 01:07:16,364
Nice accessory.
But l don't want to play dress-up with you.

918
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:18,825
Let's get out of here. Let's beat it.

919
01:07:22,705 --> 01:07:25,415
No! Right in the nose again!

920
01:07:25,833 --> 01:07:28,918
So it's gonna get physical, is it?

921
01:07:29,003 --> 01:07:33,047
Did you really think you could
just run away from Happy Chapman?

922
01:07:33,132 --> 01:07:36,301
- ls this a cry for help!
- No dumb dirty animal

923
01:07:36,385 --> 01:07:39,095
is ever gonna get the better of me.

924
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:43,808
Let's see how you feel with 200 volts
coursing through your thick canine skull.

925
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:45,226
- Chapman.
- Come here.

926
01:07:45,311 --> 01:07:49,189
Get your hands off of my friend!

927
01:07:56,864 --> 01:07:58,573
Hey. What round is it?

928
01:07:58,657 --> 01:08:01,075
- Good to see you.
- We're here to help.

929
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:03,286
- Sir Roland?
- ln the fur.

930
01:08:04,955 --> 01:08:06,456
Come on, come on, come on.

931
01:08:31,065 --> 01:08:33,399
Rats! Agh!

932
01:08:38,197 --> 01:08:42,116
Here's the drill. Cats, scratch
like you've never scratched before.

933
01:08:42,201 --> 01:08:44,369
Dogs, bite but don't chew. And rats?

934
01:08:45,454 --> 01:08:48,498
See if you can get that pretty
necklace around his neck.

935
01:08:51,126 --> 01:08:55,088
Canines, felines and vermines,

936
01:08:55,172 --> 01:08:57,882
it's show time.

937
01:09:03,931 --> 01:09:07,058
Thanks, boys.
The home team will take it from here.

938
01:09:07,226 --> 01:09:09,644
Better split
before animal control gets here.

939
01:09:09,728 --> 01:09:12,522
- Garfield, shake it easy.
- See you later.

940
01:09:14,608 --> 01:09:18,278
Odie, would you mind
sharing the remote, please?

941
01:09:21,156 --> 01:09:23,950
Every dog has his day, Happy.

942
01:09:25,077 --> 01:09:28,079
- Nice kitty.
- Let's see what's on the news.

943
01:09:32,084 --> 01:09:38,131
Let me tell you something. To you, Odie
might be just a dumb, stupid, smelly dog.

944
01:09:38,215 --> 01:09:41,134
But to me, he's all that and much more.

945
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:45,638
He's my friend.

946
01:09:45,973 --> 01:09:49,183
Odie, try something else.
Maybe there's a game on.

947
01:09:55,941 --> 01:09:58,526
Strong finish, little buddy.

948
01:09:58,611 --> 01:10:00,737
Odie? Garfield?

949
01:10:00,821 --> 01:10:02,906
- Odie?
- Odie?

950
01:10:02,990 --> 01:10:04,782
Odie?

951
01:10:06,201 --> 01:10:10,079
- Be happy.
- This is for stealing my dog and my cat.

952
01:10:13,208 --> 01:10:15,752
He didn't steal me.
l was doing the rescue work.

953
01:10:15,836 --> 01:10:17,670
Garfield. Odie.

954
01:10:17,755 --> 01:10:20,006
- Come here.
- Come here.

955
01:10:20,090 --> 01:10:23,801
l missed you guys so much.
l was so worried about you.

956
01:10:23,886 --> 01:10:29,307
Never gonna let you out of my sight again.
Never. You guys are my best friends.

957
01:10:29,391 --> 01:10:31,809
You had me at hello.

958
01:10:34,688 --> 01:10:38,149
This is WaIter J. Chapman,
with breaking news from the Midwest.

959
01:10:38,233 --> 01:10:41,194
Abby ShieIds reporting.
What you got for me, Abby?

960
01:10:41,820 --> 01:10:47,116
It appears that a deranged man
may be the cause of aII the troubIe here.

961
01:10:47,201 --> 01:10:49,786
A deranged man? What is this?

962
01:10:49,870 --> 01:10:53,623
In fact, the poIice are bringing
the suspect out as we speak.

963
01:10:53,707 --> 01:10:55,750
Good grief, it's my idiot brother.

964
01:10:55,834 --> 01:10:58,628
That's Happy Chapman.

965
01:10:58,754 --> 01:11:01,756
He's going for a ride in the police car.

966
01:11:01,882 --> 01:11:06,094
Sources tell me that
this incident somehow invoIved a dog

967
01:11:06,178 --> 01:11:08,262
and a very heroic cat.

968
01:11:08,347 --> 01:11:12,100
- Garfield?
- He saved Odie.

969
01:11:12,184 --> 01:11:15,061
- Now he's a hero.
- l didn't realize.

970
01:11:15,145 --> 01:11:17,522
Garfield's on TV. He's a hero!

971
01:11:20,234 --> 01:11:24,028
Garfield. That's Garfield.
Garfield's a hero now.

972
01:11:24,113 --> 01:11:27,281
Thanks, everybody.
Thanks for saying that.

973
01:11:27,366 --> 01:11:31,619
We're a whole street
full of heroes. Yeah.

974
01:11:31,704 --> 01:11:34,247
Heroes!

975
01:11:34,331 --> 01:11:38,668
Yeah. Whoa! Hey, Arlene.

976
01:11:38,752 --> 01:11:41,713
Well, it's nice to be recognized
by your peers.

977
01:11:41,797 --> 01:11:45,633
l couldn't have done this without you. l...

978
01:11:48,554 --> 01:11:52,098
- You're a really great friend.
- Jon,

979
01:11:52,182 --> 01:11:55,727
l want to be more than your friend.

980
01:11:55,811 --> 01:11:58,187
- You do?
- Yeah.

981
01:12:01,275 --> 01:12:04,902
Where do they find the energy?

982
01:12:22,796 --> 01:12:27,550
Yeah. Just one big happy family.

983
01:12:27,634 --> 01:12:29,677
Yeah, right!

984
01:12:29,762 --> 01:12:31,846
Hit the floor.

985
01:12:31,930 --> 01:12:37,143
No. Seriously, you can come up, buddy.
Come on. No, seriously, come on up.

986
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:42,690
Down you go. We just hit it off so great
because we both love the same thing.

987
01:12:42,775 --> 01:12:45,943
And that is... me.

988
01:12:46,570 --> 01:12:49,614
I feeI good

Oh, yeah. Hagh!

I feeI good

992

So good, I got you

Oops!

Odie, my friend, bring me some ice.
