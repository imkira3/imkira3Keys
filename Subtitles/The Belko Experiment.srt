165
00:12:01,472 --> 00:12:03,472

What the...

169
00:12:10,815 --> 00:12:11,815
Not a clue.

170
00:12:12,483 --> 00:12:13,653
Hey, all the lines
are dead.

171
00:12:13,818 --> 00:12:15,148
AGNES: What did that man say?

172
00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:16,919
(SHOUTS) He wanted us
to kill each other?

173
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:18,465
Panicking is not gonna
help anybody, Agnes.

174
00:12:18,489 --> 00:12:20,449
Calm down, it's okay.

175
00:12:20,658 --> 00:12:22,828
Anything?
No. Nothing.

176
00:12:22,952 --> 00:12:25,162
Calmly, we need to
evacuate the floor.

177
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:27,160
Mikey, come on.
It's a joke, man.

178
00:12:27,331 --> 00:12:30,671
Yeah, probably, yeah.
But still.

179
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:34,051
Okay.
Break time.

180
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,840
Hey, let's not take
the elevator, okay?

181
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:38,337
Let's use the stairs.
Why?

182
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:39,679
It's less risky.

183
00:12:40,344 --> 00:12:41,974
We're all gonna die.

What's that noise?

190
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:33,312
Just go.
Head on down, okay?

191
00:13:33,481 --> 00:13:34,841
Mike, come on.
I'll be right there.

192
00:13:38,402 --> 00:13:39,602
Hey, are you
trying the police?

193
00:13:39,695 --> 00:13:41,485
Yeah. Reception's
usually fine here.

194
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:48,504
What in bloody hell?

you're gonna break your foot.

(ALL CLAMORING)

00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:21,108
No! How is this connected to the
security check this morning?

199
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:22,278
I don't know, sir!

200
00:14:22,446 --> 00:14:23,606

00:14:26,784 --> 00:14:28,414
I just validate, okay?

203
00:14:30,788 --> 00:14:32,578
Hey, Bud.

204
00:14:32,748 --> 00:14:34,748
What do you think, Mikey?
What's this all about?

205
00:14:34,917 --> 00:14:37,117
I don't know. You think you
got a way to get through it?

206
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:40,801
Blowtorch could do the job,
but I don't know how thick it is.

207
00:14:40,965 --> 00:14:42,415
It could take a while.

208
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,403
What if we try cutting through
one of the walls first?

209
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:47,197
Wouldn't it be easier to
try to get through cement

210
00:14:47,221 --> 00:14:49,221
than get through whatever that is?
No, no, no.

211
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:52,230
This metal surrounds
the entire building.

212
00:14:53,644 --> 00:14:55,444
So the whole building's covered?
Yeah.

213
00:14:58,816 --> 00:15:01,896
It's worth a shot, though, right?
The blowtorch?

214
00:15:03,112 --> 00:15:04,112
It's worth a try.

215
00:15:06,115 --> 00:15:07,115
I'll make a call.

216
00:15:08,242 --> 00:15:09,662
Hey, where you guys going?

217
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:12,832
Roof. See if we can get
someone's attention.

218
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:16,253
Got anything?
Still nothing.

219
00:15:16,417 --> 00:15:18,311
Thought we'd get a shot here
in the lobby, but...

220
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:20,245
Can you guys
stick around for me?

221
00:15:20,796 --> 00:15:23,836
Oh, that's great. Like I didn't
already feel trapped in this job.

222
00:15:24,592 --> 00:15:26,012
Hey, listen up,
everybody, okay?

223
00:15:27,845 --> 00:15:30,595
I'm Barry Norris, the COO here,
for people who don't know.

224
00:15:31,015 --> 00:15:32,015
Listen,

225
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,310
I'm aware that
this is a very...

226
00:15:35,853 --> 00:15:38,193
Hell, to say the least,
a very strange situation here.

227
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:40,315
But I don't believe
there's any cause for panic.

228
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:44,152
All right? We're still trying to figure
out exactly what the situation is,

229
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:46,526
but I'm certain there's
a rational explanation.

230
00:15:46,697 --> 00:15:48,367
This is
a government building.

231
00:15:48,532 --> 00:15:50,532
We think maybe somebody
put precautions in place

232
00:15:50,618 --> 00:15:51,698
in case of
a military event.

233
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:53,659
Obviously these walls.

234
00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:57,959
Now, someone has clearly
discovered this feature,

235
00:15:58,167 --> 00:16:00,457
and they're having
a little fun at our expense.

236
00:16:00,628 --> 00:16:01,628
Okay?

237
00:16:04,173 --> 00:16:08,053
Whoever's doing this, the object
is to get all of you upset.

238
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:09,798
So let's not play
into that, okay?

239
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:11,850
Let's just remain calm,
chill out,

240
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:13,408
and take a few minutes
to figure out

241
00:16:13,432 --> 00:16:14,732
exactly what's happening,
okay?

242
00:16:14,892 --> 00:16:16,522
So, thank you.
I'm gonna go work on that.

243
00:16:16,685 --> 00:16:18,895
And I'll circle back
to you as soon as I can.

244
00:16:19,063 --> 00:16:20,363
Thanks, everybody.

245
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:24,989
So, someone's just
taking the piss. Right?

246
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:33,743

Hey, what's up?

249
00:16:36,872 --> 00:16:37,922
Are you smoking pot?

250
00:16:38,082 --> 00:16:39,082
What?

251
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:41,749
We just had our lives threatened
and you come up to hang out?

252
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:43,339
That dude on the speakers?
Please.

253
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:44,917
That shit's hilarious.

254
00:16:45,089 --> 00:16:47,219
You guys are insane
for smoking pot at Belko.

255
00:16:47,383 --> 00:16:49,093
They test here.
They'll fire you, you know.

256
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:51,679
It's from Panama, man.
It's not that strong.

257
00:16:51,887 --> 00:16:53,177
(LAUGHS)

258
00:16:53,764 --> 00:16:55,274
It isn't.
I know.

259
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:20,458
It ain't melting
at all, Bud.

260
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,038
No, no, look.
It ain't even hot.

261
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,340
What?
Feel it. Feel it.

262
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,640
I've never seen
anything like that.

263
00:17:32,553 --> 00:17:34,223
Do you know what
kind of metal this is?

264
00:17:34,847 --> 00:17:35,847
BUD: Mmm.

265
00:17:36,974 --> 00:17:38,734
I don't really know.

266
00:17:44,648 --> 00:17:45,648
MIKE: Barry.

267
00:17:46,442 --> 00:17:48,492
Sorry, this is rude.

268
00:17:48,652 --> 00:17:50,532
Damn hot with
all these bodies.

269
00:17:50,738 --> 00:17:54,318
Yeah. Um, I think that they
turned the air conditioning off.

270
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:55,661
Hey, Wendell.
Yo!

271
00:17:55,826 --> 00:17:57,156
Can I get one of those?
100%.

272
00:17:59,121 --> 00:18:00,251
Hey, listen.

273
00:18:01,832 --> 00:18:04,632
It's great that you
calmed everybody down,

274
00:18:05,711 --> 00:18:07,301
but, um, I don't
think this is a prank.

275
00:18:07,463 --> 00:18:09,013
No?

276
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:11,183
No, I mean,
these walls,

277
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:14,851
they seem designed to keep
people in just as much as out.

278
00:18:15,012 --> 00:18:17,722
There's no cell reception.
That's not an easy thing to accomplish.

279
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:20,230
(SOFTLY) Those new
guards this morning?

280
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:21,852
I saw one of them
heading over

281
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:23,435
to that old hangar
that's next door.

282
00:18:23,604 --> 00:18:26,404
So my guess is that is
where they're set up.

283
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:30,988
So what are you saying?

284
00:18:31,737 --> 00:18:33,377
We should pick out
a couple folks to kill?

285
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:34,950
No, no.
Not at all.

286
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:37,325
That was a joke, Mike.

287
00:18:37,493 --> 00:18:38,833
Yeah. (CHUCKLES)

288
00:18:38,994 --> 00:18:40,294
I mean, I know.

289
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:43,964
Um, but I'm not sure how much
people are gonna be joking

290
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:45,384
if something else
happens.

291
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:46,962
Something like what?

292
00:18:49,588 --> 00:18:51,548
Something.
Listen, Mike.

293
00:18:51,715 --> 00:18:52,795
In a situation like this,

294
00:18:52,883 --> 00:18:55,223
it's normal for a handful of
folks to panic and overreact.

295
00:18:55,385 --> 00:18:57,175
Would you agree with that?
Sure.

296
00:18:57,346 --> 00:19:00,516
So why don't you consider that you
might be one of those people?

297
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:01,682
All right?

298
00:19:03,268 --> 00:19:05,148
I brought some bottled water
from the cafeteria.

299
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,830
Why don't you guys
grab yourselves some?

300
00:19:13,904 --> 00:19:16,664
Not getting jack up here, either.
God damn it.

301
00:19:16,824 --> 00:19:17,954
Keith!

302
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:20,288
I see one!
Who?

303
00:19:20,494 --> 00:19:21,624
Right there! Look!

304
00:19:21,787 --> 00:19:24,117
In the window.
The security guard from this morning.

305

KEITH: Hello!
LEOTA: Help us!

307
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:29,803
We're stuck!
We're trapped!

00:19:32,214 --> 00:19:34,014
(ALL SHOUTING)

310
00:19:35,384 --> 00:19:36,384
Hey!

311
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:37,506
Hey!
Hey!

312
00:19:37,678 --> 00:19:38,928
What the fuck?

313
00:19:39,096 --> 00:19:42,266
You guys,
quit getting so worked up.

314
00:19:43,684 --> 00:19:44,984
I'm sorry.
What, man?

315
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:47,603
Bro, did you even happen
to read what you signed

316
00:19:47,771 --> 00:19:49,441
when you started
working for this place?

317
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:52,320
We gave these fuckers
the right to do

318
00:19:52,484 --> 00:19:54,420
practically whatever the fuck
they wanted to do to us.

319
00:19:54,444 --> 00:19:55,494
Oh, kill us?

320
00:19:55,654 --> 00:19:56,864

to answer a few questions.

1296
01:20:45,383 --> 01:20:46,593
What are you doing here?

1297
01:20:47,719 --> 01:20:48,849
What is this?

1298
01:20:49,012 --> 01:20:50,762
THE VOICE: I'm sorry,
we're not at liberty

1299
01:20:50,931 --> 01:20:53,771
to discuss the particulars
of the experiment, Mr. Milch.

1300
01:20:56,686 --> 01:20:58,356
Who are you?

1301
01:20:59,439 --> 01:21:03,649
We're part of an international
organization, Mr. Milch.

1302
01:21:04,528 --> 01:21:06,698
Some of the greatest
thinkers in the world,

1303
01:21:06,863 --> 01:21:10,163
who believe social scientists
must be allowed

1304
01:21:10,325 --> 01:21:14,745
to study human behavior
unfettered by

1305
01:21:14,913 --> 01:21:17,293
conventional concepts.

1306
01:21:18,166 --> 01:21:19,496
And believe me

1307
01:21:19,876 --> 01:21:21,876
we've learned
an incredible amount

1308
01:21:21,962 --> 01:21:23,842
about the human mind
and behavior

1309
01:21:24,005 --> 01:21:25,585
since we started
these experiments.

1310
01:21:25,757 --> 01:21:26,967
Why?

1311
01:21:28,593 --> 01:21:29,593
What for?

1312
01:21:33,807 --> 01:21:38,057
Well, perhaps someday the
world will be better built.

1313
01:21:39,729 --> 01:21:41,149
It's not my concern.

1314
01:21:41,940 --> 01:21:43,610
Science is method.

1315
01:21:43,775 --> 01:21:45,315
We're simply gathering data.

1316
01:21:45,485 --> 01:21:46,695
Data?

1317
01:21:47,320 --> 01:21:50,990
Just answer our questions,
and we'll let you be on your way, yes?

1318
01:21:51,908 --> 01:21:53,488
Now, which emotion

1319
01:21:53,660 --> 01:21:57,210
most accurately describes
how you feel in this moment?

1320
01:21:57,372 --> 01:21:59,872
A, sad.

1321
01:22:00,417 --> 01:22:01,787
B, relieved.

C, confused. D...

1323
01:22:05,755 --> 01:22:08,255
So you've been watching
everything that we do in there.

1324
01:22:08,425 --> 01:22:11,385
We are not here to answer your questions.
You are here to answer ours.

1325
01:22:11,553 --> 01:22:14,513
Well, then I suppose you saw
me pick up those explosives?

1326
01:22:22,230 --> 01:22:24,480
And where are
these explosives now?

1327
01:22:25,233 --> 01:22:26,323
On you.

1328
01:22:28,153 --> 01:22:29,703
You fucking piece of shit.

1329
01:22:30,155 --> 01:22:31,235

Michael

1337
01:23:02,479 --> 01:23:05,609
your actions today...

1338
01:23:10,236 --> 01:23:14,066
You believe life is sacred.
Yeah?
