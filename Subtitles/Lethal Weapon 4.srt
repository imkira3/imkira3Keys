-lt's Butters, captain.
-Yeah. I'll remember that.

-Kid really likes you.
-l wish he'd cut that shit out.

-What?

No. You don't think he likes me,

-Oh.

This is not the military,
it's the police force.

The millennium's creeping up on us.

"New people, new department."

-l need to talk to you.
-Do you? Ah. What is it this time?

Recurring dreams about flying dwarfs?

-Or did you cook up something new?
-l'm sorry about all that.

I wanted your advice.
I was thinking of--

-Thinking?
-Marriage.

[LAUGHS]

640
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:08,141
Marriage? The "M" word?

641
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:10,852
Does "confidentiality"
mean anything to you?

642
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,479
That's funny.

643

You know what would happen?
We'd go in my office...

-...and you know what you'd tell me?
-What?

645
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:21,071
You'd tell me something like, "Doc...

646

...l want to marry Murtaugh."

647

Or how about Nelson Mandela?

Something to ridicule me, Riggs.

Something to get a rise out of me.

-Captain Murtaugh.

They were short, but big enough
to kick your ass. What can l do for you?

672

One of the ship's crew shot one of
the illegals, apparently under orders...

...and we'd dearly like to know
who's smuggling Chinese these days.

He's got a nightclub,
couple restaurants.

681

He operates mainly out on North Broadway.
Here's the address.

What you got on the freighter homicide?

686
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:16,686
I'm all over it. I talked to some illegals.
They only knew the shooter by sight.

687
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:18,188
Checked out the boat.

688
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:22,025
Turns out the boat's registered under
a dummy corporation out of Indonesia.

689

It'll be a rough one to crack,
but we'll nail them.

Benny Chan.
No. What kind of bad man is he?

Real bad.
Big crime boss in Chinatown.

Benny's doing it.

At this restaurant.

I'm hungry for Chinese, Rog.
How about you?
