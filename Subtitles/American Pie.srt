1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:31,490
Ohh,
you're so good.

3
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:34,785
Ohh, yes.
I am the best, baby.

4
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:37,246
- Oh, yeah!
- Oh. Oh, that was a tit.

5
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:39,706
That is a tit! Yes!

6
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,750
Oh, you're so big!

7
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:44,586
Oh, yeah. Yeah,
that's right, baby.

8
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,880
- Oh, doggie wants to hide his bone.
- Yes!

9
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:49,091
Oh, yeah!
I'm bone smugglin', baby.

10
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:51,260
Man, would you shut up!

11
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:53,762
Hey, Jimmy.
Just wanted to say sweet dreams.

12
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:55,764
Yeah, yeah.
Sweet dreams. Good night, Mom.

13
00:00:55,848 --> 00:00:59,101
Kiss good night.

14
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:02,396
- Something wrong with the reception?
- Uh, yeah. Yeah.

15
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:05,107
- There's... There's this nature show
that I'm trying to watch.
- Take it off.

16
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:09,069
- And the birds are
all scrambled and I can't even...
- Do me! Yes!

17
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:12,155
Baby! Ride me like a pony!

18
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:15,659
The thing must be broken or I
sat on the remote or something.

19
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:18,161
- Getting ready for bed, son?
- Yup, I'm all set, Dad. I'm all set.

20
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:21,290
- Yeah?
- No! No, I think he's tried
to watch some illegal channels.

21
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:24,334
- Illegal... Illegal channels?
- This is just bad reception, honey.

22
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:26,420
- Oh, spank my hairy ass!
- What's that?

23
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:30,299
- Ooh, baby!
- You know what? Here.
Just give me this, please...

24
00:01:30,382 --> 00:01:33,177
- Oh, my God!
- And let's get this...

25
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:36,972
Okay, okay. Let's, uh... What the hell's
the matter with this thing?

26
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:38,348
Yes!

27
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:38,765
Yes!

28
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:52,404
Illegal channels?
Shit!

29
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:54,823
If there's any channel that should be
illegal, it's that "all-woman's" channel.

30
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:58,744
- Lifetime supply
of pantyhose or some shit.
- Yeah.

31
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:01,163
Hey, uh, did you see The Little Mermaid
on TV the other night?

32
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:04,208
- No.
- Ariel, man. She's so hot!

33
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:08,253
- She's a mermaid, dude.
- Yeah, Oz. But not when she's on land.

34
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:12,883
Come on, Vicky, it's Stifler's
party. We got to go. It'll be great.

35
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:16,720
Why? All that happens at Stifler's
parties is people get drunk and do it.

36
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,722
Yeah.

37
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,724
Now, come on, Kevin.
Open it.

38
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:24,061
It's a big, thick envelope, Vicky.
You got in.

39
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,313
If you think so,
just open it.

40
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:28,357
Fine.

41
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,992
"Dear Miss Latham: We're sorry but
after keeping you on the waiting list...

42
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:42,579
for the past couple of months, we've
decided that you are now rejected."

43
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:44,623
Shut up!

44
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:49,545
- You got in.
- Yes! I love you!

45
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:52,130
Okay.

46
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:01,223
Hey, you think I should wear
this shirt to Stifler's party?

47
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:03,809
You've worn that shirt for,
like, three days in a row, man!

48
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,894
Guys.
She said it.

49
00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:08,355
- Said what?
- She said she loves me.

50
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,691
- Holy shit, dude! The "L" word?
- Oh, man!

51
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:13,151
Cornell's not
that far from "U" of "M."

52
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:15,153
Yeah, it's only,
like, seven hours.

53
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:17,197
Oh, and you get
to drive across Canada.

54
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:21,743
- Beautiful country.
- Whatever. It's doable.

55
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:24,496
Wh-What we should
do today, in band.

56
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:28,417
Instead of playing our instruments
regularly, we should play them backwards.

57
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,752
- That'll be so funny!
- Yeah.

58
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:39,469
No offense, but you're talking about a
post-high school, long-distance relationship.

59
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,555
And you and Kevin
haven't even done it yet.

60
00:03:41,597 --> 00:03:43,724
That's not why
we're going out.

61
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:47,311
What do you expect him to drive
to Cornell for? Milk and cookies?

62
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,563
We're gonna have sex
when he's ready and I'm ready.

63
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,732
It's got to be
completely perfect.

64
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:54,860
I want the right time, the right moment,
the right place...

65
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:57,696
Vicky, it's not
a space shuttle launch. It's sex.

66
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,994
- Finch.
- Here's the man we are looking for.

67
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,120
- Gentlemen.
- What's goin' on, buddy?

68
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:06,163
- Gentlemen.
- What's goin' on, buddy?

69
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,625
- Same ol'...
- Finch. You got the Latin homework?

70
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:15,380
Oh.

71
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:17,966
It means, "My dog ate it."
It's Latin. It's a joke.

72
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:22,387
- It's a Latin joke.
- Yeah, Latin. Just drink your coffee.

73
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,723
- No, Jim, it's mochaccino.
- What?

74
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,309
What I'm drinking, it's mochaccino.
It's not coffee.

75
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:29,353
'Nova!

76
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,480
What's up, dude?

77
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:33,732
You comin' to the party
tonight, Ozzie, you fuckface?

78
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:36,193
Uh, depends if my date
wants to stop by.

79
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:39,404
- I'm workin' on somethin' new.
- I got an idea about something new.

80
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:41,782
How about you guys
actually locate your dicks,

81
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:44,743
remove the shrink-wrap
and fucking use them!

82
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:48,580
Dude, it's gonna happen.
She's a college chick.

83
00:04:48,664 --> 00:04:51,083
Oh, right.
I'll see you guys tonight.

84
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:54,711
I'll look for you in the no-fucking
section.

85
00:04:58,257 --> 00:05:02,219
All right. I'm shooting for a
9:00 E.T.A. beer in hand by five after.

86
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,513
Breath check.

87
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:09,393
Thank you.

88
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:18,652
- I wish you wouldn't do that.
- So, you got something up
your sleeve for tonight?

89
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:21,572
This is a foolproof plan,
my friend.

90
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:23,657
I have a serious question
to ask you guys. Okay.

91
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:27,411
You know Nadia the Czechoslovakian
chick? She might be there tonight.

92
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:29,705
Now, do you think she would prefer...

93
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,500
Laid-back Jim...

94
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:36,253
or...

95
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:39,131
Cool, hip Jim?

96
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:41,216
I don't think it really matters
with that shirt you're wearing.

97
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,678
What? Correct me if I'm wrong but
you're the one with the girlfriend...

98
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,722
and you're still
stranded on third base.

99
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:49,474
Hey, at least I know what
third base feels like, okay?

100
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:52,102
- You're still just a batboy.
- Batboy. Batboy.

101
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:54,104
What are you talking about?

102
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:56,940
Guys, uh...

103
00:05:57,024 --> 00:06:00,277
What exactly does
third base feel like?

104
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,321
You wanna
take this one?

105
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:07,910
- Like warm apple pie.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

106
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:11,246
Apple pie, huh?

107
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:14,041
McDonald's or homemade?

108
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:17,711
Gentlemen,
destiny awaits.

I'll be back for you later.

- Another party sultan!
- How ya doin'?

118
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:52,162
Welcome to Stifler's
Palace of Love, fellas.

- Yeah.

120
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:58,877
Vicky, Jessica! Great to see you.
Glad you could make it.

Fellas!
What's goin' on?

126
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:15,602
Sherman. Not much. Just, uh,
scopin' the babes.

127
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:19,273
Indeed! Some fine ladies here, boys.

128
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:22,860
Confidence is high.
Repeat. Confidence is high.

129
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:25,320
Sherman is movin'
to DEFCON 2.

130
00:07:25,404 --> 00:07:28,740
- Full strategic arsenal
ready for deployment.
- Hey!

131
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:30,951
You have somethin'
goin' tonight, Sherman?

132
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:33,161
You see that
Central chick, Bernette?

133
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:34,872
- Um, no.
- No.

134
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:38,250
She's around.
Seems she's taken a liking to me.

135
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:43,046
Fellas, it's time
she experienced... the Shermanator.

136
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,424
Yeah, okay,
Sherman. Whatever.

137
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:49,553
I'm a sophisticated sex robot
sent back through time...

138
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:53,140
to change the future
for one lucky lady.

139
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:56,643
Go get 'em, tiger.
I'll be back!

140
00:07:58,854 --> 00:08:00,814

- Completely.

There's Nadia and
she just looked at me.

00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,954
Yeah.

146
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:18,499
Yeah, you're right, Kev.
I should just go talk to her.

147
00:08:20,626 --> 00:08:22,544
Yeah,
I could do that. Sure.

148

We're here for the party.

162
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:37,286
What party?
There's no party.

163
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:39,580
Party!

164
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:45,961
Weird.
Try the house down the street.

165
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:53,385
So, what's your major?

166
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:55,554
Post-modern feminist thought.

167
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:58,974
Oh, cool.
Great night, isn't it?

168
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:02,227
Sure.

169
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:07,691
Yeah, it's just somethin' about the
springtime that's just cool, you know?

170
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:12,196
Like the smell
of fresh rain or somethin'.

171
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:14,573
Suck me, beautiful.

172
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:17,159
What did you just say?

173
00:10:17,201 --> 00:10:20,954
Suck me, beautiful.

174
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:26,210
My friends call me "'Nova,"
as in Casanova.

175
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:28,587
That's pathetic.

176
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:32,174
Jeez, you don't
have to laugh at me.

177
00:10:32,216 --> 00:10:34,218
Well, there's just some things
you need to learn, that's all.

178
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:36,595
- Like what?
- Well, you've got to tone it down.

179
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:38,889
You don't need to come
to a place like Lookout Point...

180
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:41,934
and spout off
cheeseball lines to be romantic.

181
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:45,229
- Okay.
- You have to pay attention to a girl.

182
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:49,441
Be sensitive to her feelings.
Relationships are reciprocal.

183
00:10:49,525 --> 00:10:53,737
Come on, Casanova.
I'll take you back to your friends.

184
00:10:58,784 --> 00:11:03,288
Vicky, think it's time to take
the next step in our relationship?

185
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:07,042
- Tonight?
- Yeah, it's such a perfect evening.

186
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,545
I mean, it's how you've
always pictured it, isn't it?

187
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:11,755
Damn, my parts fuckin' stink!

188
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,717
Dude, you gotta take
a shit! You smell like a Yeti!

189
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:18,595
Or not.

190
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:21,431
Just relax.

191
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:27,396
You actually
said that?

192
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:30,607
Shut up!

193
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:32,734
You did a hell of a lot better
than I did with Nadia.

194
00:11:32,818 --> 00:11:35,779
Oh, thanks, Jim, that's great.
That's really reassuring.

195
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:38,323
Hey, no problem,
'Nova.

196
00:11:38,407 --> 00:11:42,327
Hey, don't call me 'Nova anymore.
I'm a... I'm a fraud.

197
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:44,830
You guys
are pathetic.

198
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:47,833
I'm gonna find myself
a little hottie.

199
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:51,628
"Suck me, beautiful"!

200
00:11:56,592 --> 00:11:59,178
- Let me know.
- Okay.

201
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:01,597
Keep going.

202
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,183
I should be able
to talk to girls.

203
00:12:04,266 --> 00:12:06,602
I'm articulate.

204
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:08,937
You know, I got a 720
on my S.A.T. Verbal.

205
00:12:09,021 --> 00:12:11,231
Bullshit.
There's no way.

206
00:12:11,273 --> 00:12:15,194
I kid you not, man.
Look. Listen.

207
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:19,615
Copious. Verisimilitude.

208
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:22,701
Oh, ohh. Now.

209
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:35,088
Suck me,
beautiful!

210
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,966
- Damn it, Stifler.
- Checkout time!

211
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:43,347
- Please, vacate the room.
- You are such a jerk.

212
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:50,979
God, I can't believe how many
cool people are at this party.

213
00:12:51,063 --> 00:12:54,358
Yup.

214
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,693
And you got
a keg too!

215
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:59,613
- Wow!
- Indeed.

216
00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:07,746
Oh, wait.
I left my beer downstairs.

217
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:10,249
No. No.
Here, babe!

218
00:13:10,332 --> 00:13:13,252
Thanks.

219
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:16,380
You're really
beautiful. Oh...

220
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:20,092
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

221
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:37,693
You know what? I don't know
if I want to be doing this.

222
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:42,531
- Doing what?
- You know, like, if we hook up tonight,

223
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:45,492
tomorrow I'll just be some girl
you go telling all your friends about.

224
00:13:45,576 --> 00:13:48,954
No way!

225
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:51,957
Steve, you could at least look at me
when you say that!

226
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:56,670
Look. Sarah,

227
00:13:56,753 --> 00:14:00,716
I... I wouldn't go telling
stories or anything about you.

228
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:05,387
I promise.
So, just... relax,

229
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:09,683
take it slow... and
let the good times roll.

230
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:15,397
- Okay.
- All right.

231
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:24,114
What's wrong?

232
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:28,368
What's wrong?
What is it?

233
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:35,542
Xenophobic.

234
00:14:35,584 --> 00:14:40,005
Oh!

235
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:42,966
- Regurgitation.
- I know that one.

236
00:14:44,176 --> 00:14:47,554
- Kevin likes it.
- He likes getting head.

237
00:14:47,638 --> 00:14:50,182
Gee, what a total shocker.
What about you, Vicky?

238
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:52,434
I mean, h-have you just
never had one with Kevin...

239
00:14:52,518 --> 00:14:54,478
or have you never
had one, period?

240
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:56,897
I've had one.

241
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,191
- I think.
- Okay.

242
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:03,111
That's a no. No wonder
you're not psyched about sex.

243
00:15:03,195 --> 00:15:05,113
You tell me you never
even had one manually?

244
00:15:05,197 --> 00:15:08,450
- I've never tried it.
- You've never double-clicked your mouse?

245
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:11,662
Ha-ha, nice!

246
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:14,373
Jesus! Stifler, how much
did you drink, man?

247
00:15:14,456 --> 00:15:18,418
Hey, Stifler?
How's the pale ale?

248
00:15:18,502 --> 00:15:22,256
- Fuck you!
- Ooh, whoo!

249
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:26,426
- That's Stifler's mom?
- Yup.

250
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:31,515
Shit. I cannot believe a fine woman
like this produced a guy like Stifler.

251
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:35,519
- Dude, that chick's a "MILF."
- What the hell is that?

252
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:39,773
- M-I-L-F... Mom I'd like to fuck.
- Yeah, dude!

253
00:15:39,815 --> 00:15:41,900
Oh-ho, yeah!

254
00:15:41,984 --> 00:15:45,028
- Yeah! MILF! MILF!
- Hey, guys... Guys. Guys.

255
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:48,448
- Come here.
- Sherman, what's goin' on?

256
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:52,953
Yeah, uh... Don't you think you fellas
could try a little tact?

257
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:57,791
I got company,
if you know what I mean?

258
00:15:59,293 --> 00:16:01,879
She's hot!

259
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:09,386
If Sherman has sex before I do,
I'm gonna be really pissed.

260
00:16:09,428 --> 00:16:14,516
Sherman?
The Shermanator?

261
00:16:14,558 --> 00:16:18,020
Come on, man.

262
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:21,607
MILF! MILF!

263
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:25,944
MILF! MILF! Dude, hey, dude.
What are you doin' to her, dude?

264
00:16:26,028 --> 00:16:29,406
Oh, my God,
bro, dude.

265
00:16:29,448 --> 00:16:32,701
Enough of this blow job bullshit.

266
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:36,455
- I gotta get laid already.
- That's nice. Really, really nice.

267
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:40,292
- Can I have a ride?
- Sure.

268
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:43,837
- Vicky, wait.
- Not for you.

269
00:16:43,887 --> 00:16:48,225
Yeti!
I am the Yeti!

270
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:59,269
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Finch.

271
00:16:59,353 --> 00:17:03,273
Where were you last night, huh? What
happened to that foolproof plan of yours?

272
00:17:03,315 --> 00:17:06,443
Well, I was going for a fashionably-late
entrance and I was too late.

273
00:17:06,527 --> 00:17:09,363
So,
no ladies left.

274
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:11,949
It was a very
special night, very special.

275
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:14,618
Guys. Guys.

276
00:17:16,954 --> 00:17:20,958
- I'll never forget this.
- Oh, I'll never forget it, either.

277
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:25,462
- Thank you.
- Uhh.

278
00:17:25,546 --> 00:17:29,633
- Well, bye.
- Bye.

279
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:31,635
Bye.

280
00:17:33,846 --> 00:17:37,266
Fellas, say good-bye
to Chuck Sherman, the boy.

281
00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:40,018
I... am now a man.

282
00:17:40,102 --> 00:17:42,771
I highly recommend
you join the club.

283
00:17:42,855 --> 00:17:48,193
We were doin' the wild thing...
all night. I'm exhausted.

284
00:17:48,277 --> 00:17:51,363
I don't get it. I mean,
how the hell did you do that?

285
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:56,118
It was just my time.
It was just my time.

286
00:17:57,536 --> 00:17:59,872
Best of luck
to you boys.

287
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,335
- I cannot believe this.
- Come on, guys.

288
00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:08,130
You know, we should
be happy for Sherman.

289
00:18:09,131 --> 00:18:11,675
No, we shouldn't be.

290
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:14,678
You know, I put in months
of quality time with Vicky.

291
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:17,389
Sherman meets a chick
for one night and scores.

292
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:20,142
- This is just wrong.
- No shit.

293
00:18:20,225 --> 00:18:23,687
How the hell am I supposed
to become Mr. Sensitive Man?

294
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:27,441
You know, we're all gonna go to college
as virgins. You realize this, right?

295
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:29,943
I mean, they probably have special dorms
for people like us.

296
00:18:30,027 --> 00:18:34,698
All right. I got an idea.
But it's got to stay between us.

297
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:37,326
It's really simple. We just
got to make an agreement.

298
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:39,703
Er, nah. It's...
It's more than an agreement.

299
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:41,914
- What? A bet?
- A pact.

300
00:18:41,997 --> 00:18:44,333
No money involved.
More important than any bet.

301
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:48,212
Here's the deal.
We all get laid before we graduate.

302
00:18:50,172 --> 00:18:52,716
Dude, it's not like I haven't
been trying to get laid.

303
00:18:52,758 --> 00:18:55,552
Think about when you work out, Oz.
You gotta have someone there, right?

304
00:18:55,636 --> 00:18:58,180
Someone to spot you.
Someone to keep you motivated.

305
00:18:58,263 --> 00:19:00,682
Well, that's exactly what
we can do for each other.

306
00:19:00,724 --> 00:19:03,435
I mean, we'll be there
to keep each other on track.

307
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:05,812
Separately, we are flawed
and vulnerable, but together,

308
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:08,023
we are the masters
of our sexual destiny.

309
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:10,025
Their tiger-style
kung fu is strong.

310
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:12,027
But our dragon-style
will defeat it.

311
00:19:12,069 --> 00:19:15,614
- Guys!
- The Shaolin masters from East
and West must unite!

312
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:18,242
- Fight, and find out who is number one.
- Guys!

313
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:23,080
Come on. You're ruining my moment here.
This is our very manhood at stake.

314
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:25,749
We must make
a stand, here and now.

315
00:19:27,084 --> 00:19:30,504
No longer will our penises
remain flaccid and unused!

316
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:34,675
We will fight for every man out there
who isn't getting laid and should be.

317
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:38,178
This is our day.
This is our time.

318
00:19:38,262 --> 00:19:42,599
And, by God, we will not stand by and
watch history condemn us into celibacy.

319
00:19:42,683 --> 00:19:44,643
- Amen. Yes.
- I like that.

320
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:48,605
- We will make a stand. We will succeed.
- 'Bout time!

321
00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:51,233
- We will get laid!
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

322
00:19:53,527 --> 00:19:57,489
Now, the sex: It's got
to be valid, consensual sex.

323
00:19:57,573 --> 00:20:00,951
No prostitutes.
That's what you're thinkin', Finch.

324
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:03,495
Busted.

325
00:20:03,579 --> 00:20:06,290
So, basically,
prom is our last chance.

326
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:08,458
- Oh, dude. Prom sucks.
- I know,

327
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:10,669
but you gotta think
about it this way.

328
00:20:10,752 --> 00:20:14,631
I mean, all the parties afterwards?
The chicks are going to want to do it.

329
00:20:14,673 --> 00:20:18,677
- Yeah-yeah, he's right. It's,
like tradition or something.
- The Rose Bowl.

330
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:22,973
- So, that gives us...
- Exactly three weeks to the day.

331
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:28,312
- We're gonna do this.
- All right, to the next step!
- Next step!

332
00:20:28,395 --> 00:20:28,937
Next step!

333
00:20:28,979 --> 00:20:30,814
Next step!

Don't worry. You'll
get her back soon enough.

357
00:21:51,687 --> 00:21:53,981
- You think so?
- Sure, she likes you.

358
00:21:54,064 --> 00:21:55,107
- Well, I like her too.
- Do you love her?

359
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:56,191
- Well, I like her too.
- Do you love her?

360
00:21:56,275 --> 00:22:00,195
Um, you know what?
You can't really ask me that.

361
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:03,282
Well, if you want to get her in the sack,
I mean, just tell her you love her.

362
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:06,285
- That's how I was duped.
- Look, Jessica,

363
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:08,453
I- I don't want
to dupe her.

364
00:22:08,537 --> 00:22:12,082
All right.
What you need to do...

365
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:14,334
is learn how to press
a girl's buttons.

366
00:22:14,418 --> 00:22:16,336
You have to give her
what she's never had.

367
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:19,798
- What's that?
- Let me give you a hint.

368
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,927
Ohh, Kev! Uhh. Yeah.

369
00:22:23,969 --> 00:22:27,097
- Comprende?
- You mean an orgasm.

370
00:22:27,181 --> 00:22:29,391
- You got it, stud!
- Well, you know,

371
00:22:29,474 --> 00:22:31,602
I'm-I'm pretty sure that I've...
given her a...

372
00:22:31,685 --> 00:22:35,647
- No, you haven't.
- Well, there was one time...

373
00:22:35,731 --> 00:22:39,193
- No.
- Oh, man.

374
00:22:39,276 --> 00:22:44,114
- Look, kid, it's up to you.
The big "L" or the big "O."
- Dickhead!

375
00:22:44,206 --> 00:22:47,242
- You gotta see this.
- <i>♪ Do you believe in ♪</i>

Great.
See you next time.

383
00:23:15,395 --> 00:23:18,357
- Hey, guys.
Came to watch me in action?
- Yeah.

384
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,109
- I-I think you sounded pretty good.
- Yeah, man.

385
00:23:21,193 --> 00:23:23,111
I think you need
your balls reattached.

386
00:23:23,153 --> 00:23:26,698
- Hey, keep it down, dude.
- What the fuck are you doing here?

387
00:23:26,782 --> 00:23:28,826
This place
is an untapped resource.

388
00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:30,911
I mean,
check it out.

389
00:23:30,994 --> 00:23:35,582
- These vocal jazz girls are hot.
- Why the hell is he joining
jazz choir so late?

390
00:23:35,666 --> 00:23:39,378
Maybe he's preparing for
another senior year at East?

391
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:43,507
You guys,
we don't even know him.

392
00:23:45,509 --> 00:23:47,427
You dipshit!

393
00:23:47,511 --> 00:23:49,596
You're expecting
to score with some...

394
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,598
goody-goody
choirgirl priss?

395
00:23:51,682 --> 00:23:55,811
These chicks don't know me. I can work
the sensitive angle here, fellas!

396
00:23:55,894 --> 00:23:58,105
You know, it's just like
that college chick told me.

397
00:23:58,188 --> 00:24:01,233
All that you gotta do
is just ask 'em questions...

398
00:24:01,316 --> 00:24:03,277
and listen to what
they have to say and shit.

399
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,698
I don't know, man.
That sounds like a lot of work!

400
00:24:09,616 --> 00:24:12,870
Uh, just a second!

401
00:24:18,292 --> 00:24:20,419
Come in. Come in.

402
00:24:20,502 --> 00:24:22,546
Oh, Jim, you're here.

403
00:24:22,588 --> 00:24:26,550
Uh, I was just walking
by your room and uh...

404
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:30,679
And, you know, I was thinking, "Boy,
it's been a long time since we've had...

405
00:24:30,762 --> 00:24:33,140
a little
father-son, uh-uh, chat."

406
00:24:34,516 --> 00:24:38,604
Oh! I almost forgot.
I, uh, I bought some magazines.

407
00:24:38,645 --> 00:24:41,940
Do you just want to flip
to the center section?

408
00:24:44,234 --> 00:24:46,695
Well, this is the...
this is the, uh, female form.

409
00:24:46,778 --> 00:24:49,781
And they have
focused on the breasts,

410
00:24:49,865 --> 00:24:54,620
uh, which are used primarily
to, uh, feed young infants...

411
00:24:54,703 --> 00:24:59,374
- and, uh... and also, uh, in foreplay.
- Right.

412
00:24:59,458 --> 00:25:02,794
This is, uh...
This is Hustler.

413
00:25:02,878 --> 00:25:06,632
And this is a much
more exotic magazine.

414
00:25:06,673 --> 00:25:11,512
Now, they have decided to focus
on the, uh, pubic region...

415
00:25:11,595 --> 00:25:15,432
- Right.
- The whole groin area.

416
00:25:15,516 --> 00:25:19,311
Look at the expression on her face.
You see that? See what's she's doing?

417
00:25:19,353 --> 00:25:22,439
She's kind of looking
right into your eyes saying,

418
00:25:22,523 --> 00:25:26,401
"Hey, big boy.
Hey, how ya doin'?"

419
00:25:26,443 --> 00:25:30,280
- You see?
- Right.

420
00:25:30,322 --> 00:25:34,451
Shaved is a magazine
I'm not too familiar with,

421
00:25:34,493 --> 00:25:38,789
but, again,
if you flip to the center...

422
00:25:38,831 --> 00:25:41,291
Section...

423
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:45,671
Well, you see the detail that, uh,
that they go into in this picture here.

424
00:25:45,712 --> 00:25:49,383
- Uh-huh. Yeah.
- It almost looks like
a tropical plant or something...

425
00:25:49,466 --> 00:25:51,385
- underwater... thing.
- Yeah. Yes.

426
00:25:51,468 --> 00:25:53,762
- Do you know what a clitoris is?
- Oh, my God.

427
00:25:53,846 --> 00:25:56,014
- Well, don't say, "Oh..."
- Yes, I know what a clitoris is.

428
00:25:56,098 --> 00:25:58,225
Oh, you do. Oh, I see. Yes, you do.
I forgot you've been there and back.

429
00:25:58,308 --> 00:26:00,269
- You know everything...
- I've learned about it in Sex Ed...

430
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:03,272
- I really don't need you
to talk about clitoris.
- I'm trying to make this painless...

431
00:26:03,355 --> 00:26:06,024
- You know what?
I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry.
- No-no-no.

432
00:26:06,108 --> 00:26:09,528
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

433
00:26:09,611 --> 00:26:11,613
I shouldn't
have got hot there.

434
00:26:11,697 --> 00:26:13,907
Well, you know what
I'm going to do, Jim.

435
00:26:13,991 --> 00:26:15,909
I'm going to just
leave these books here...

436
00:26:15,993 --> 00:26:19,496
for you to, uh, peruse at your, uh...
at your leisure.

437
00:26:20,372 --> 00:26:23,542
Wait!

438
00:26:27,337 --> 00:26:29,506
Well, safer
than a tube sock.

439
00:26:31,592 --> 00:26:35,554
- Okay, that... That was good.
- Yeah.

440
00:26:37,097 --> 00:26:41,059
- See you at dinner.
- Uh, yeah. I'll see you at dinner.

441
00:26:41,534 --> 00:26:43,645
So, Finch,
this is your plan?

442
00:26:43,687 --> 00:26:46,648
You know, I don't think girls are
into the whole mini-golf thing.

443
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:48,775
Kevin, I'm sure
that they're not.

444
00:26:48,817 --> 00:26:52,529
Actually, there is one small matter that
I need to ask for your cooperation in.

445
00:26:52,613 --> 00:26:55,616
- In the spirit of this
whole pact, you know?
- Sure, what do you need?

446
00:26:55,699 --> 00:26:58,952
Whatever you hear about me, you agree.
And tell all the boys the same thing.

447
00:26:58,994 --> 00:27:02,873
Look, I gotta go.
Sixteen minutes round-trip.

448
00:27:02,956 --> 00:27:05,751
You know, Finch,
it's... it's senior year.

449
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:08,170
I mean, don't you think it's time you
learned how to take a dump at school?

450
00:27:08,253 --> 00:27:11,590
When was the last time you looked
at the facilities in this school?

451
00:27:17,971 --> 00:27:20,724
Excuse me.

452
00:27:20,766 --> 00:27:23,268
Uh, that's
Paul Finch, right?

453
00:27:23,352 --> 00:27:26,104
- Yeah.
- Well, you've seen him
in the locker room, right?

454
00:27:26,188 --> 00:27:31,235
- Uh, yeah.
- So, my friends, they want
to know. Is it true?

455
00:27:31,318 --> 00:27:34,071
You know,
that he's... equipped.

456
00:27:34,154 --> 00:27:38,283
I have no idea. Finch showers
with his bathing suit on.

457
00:27:38,367 --> 00:27:40,786
I mean, uh...

458
00:27:40,869 --> 00:27:44,164
As a matter of fact, it is true.
The guy's huge!

459
00:27:44,206 --> 00:27:47,334
- Does he have a date for the prom yet?
- No, definitely not.

460
00:27:47,376 --> 00:27:49,461
All right. Thanks.

461
00:27:50,838 --> 00:27:53,173
Oh, man!

462
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:58,428
So I was thinking maybe you could
give me some advice, brother to brother.

463
00:27:58,512 --> 00:28:01,139
I thought you might know a trick
or somethin' to make her...

464
00:28:01,223 --> 00:28:05,644
- Orgasm?
- Yeah.
- What's good here?

465
00:28:05,727 --> 00:28:08,021
- Try the spicy tuna hand roll.
- What?

466
00:28:08,105 --> 00:28:11,900
- How do you do that?
- Hey, never mind that.
Listen, pay attention.

467
00:28:11,984 --> 00:28:15,237
Is that all that you're interested in,
tryin' to get your girl into bed?

468
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:18,574
No, it'd be good to be able
to, you know, return the favor.

469
00:28:18,615 --> 00:28:21,076
Be nice to know she enjoys
things as much as I do.

470
00:28:21,118 --> 00:28:24,413
See that? That's good. That's what
I wanted to hear. Now, you qualify.

471
00:28:24,454 --> 00:28:31,003
- Qualify for what?
- My man, you've
just inherited the Bible.

472
00:28:31,044 --> 00:28:33,547
It originally started
as a sex manual,

473
00:28:33,589 --> 00:28:37,009
this book that some guys
brought back from Amsterdam.

474
00:28:37,092 --> 00:28:39,720
And each year it got passed on to one
East student who was worthy.

475
00:28:39,761 --> 00:28:43,974
Now, it's full of all sorts of stuff
that guys have added over the years.

476
00:28:46,393 --> 00:28:51,648
But you have to keep it a secret
and return it at the end of the year.

477
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:55,736
All right.
So now you know. Good luck.

Thanks, uh,
Heather, right?

495
00:30:11,937 --> 00:30:13,856
Yeah.

496
00:30:13,939 --> 00:30:16,441
So, you've got this sort of
Frank Sinatra thing going on.

497
00:30:16,525 --> 00:30:21,196
Right. I feel like I've
discovered this whole new side of me.

498
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,782
I mean, uh,
music is so expressive.

499
00:30:23,824 --> 00:30:27,494
Okay.
I mean, I agree, but...

500
00:30:27,578 --> 00:30:30,622
aren't you supposed to be out,
like, trying to decapitate someone...

501
00:30:30,706 --> 00:30:34,710
- with your lacrosse stick or something?
- Oh, sure. Sure.

502
00:30:34,793 --> 00:30:36,879
You know, I know what
people think. It's like,

503
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:40,007
"Oz, he's just this
kick-ass lacrosse player."

504
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:42,759
You know, I also play football,
by the way, but that's, like,

505
00:30:42,843 --> 00:30:46,263
- that's not all that I am, you know?
- Of course, I didn't...

506
00:30:46,305 --> 00:30:50,267
I mean, it really bothers me when
people try to pigeonhole me like that.

507
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:52,311
You?

508
00:30:52,394 --> 00:30:55,230
You think
I don't get that?

509
00:30:55,314 --> 00:30:58,692
God, it's like just because I don't
get drunk and barf every weekend...

510
00:30:58,734 --> 00:31:03,030
that people say, "Oh, look. There's
this Goody Two-Shoes choirgirl priss."

511
00:31:03,071 --> 00:31:07,409
Yeah. So, like,
what else do you do?

512
00:31:07,493 --> 00:31:10,829
Well,
the same things you do,

513
00:31:10,871 --> 00:31:13,874
like hang out
with friends and stuff.

514
00:31:13,916 --> 00:31:16,335
- Why? What do you think I do?
- Oh, I...

515
00:31:16,418 --> 00:31:19,421
I just realized that I don't
know anything about you.

516
00:31:19,505 --> 00:31:24,635
- I was interested.
- Oh, well, what do you want to know?

517
00:31:24,718 --> 00:31:27,596
You know,
stuff... about you.

518
00:31:30,098 --> 00:31:32,518
All right.

519
00:31:32,601 --> 00:31:37,105
Mom, I'm home!

520
00:32:33,245 --> 00:32:35,747
Oh, yeah. Oh!

521
00:32:39,001 --> 00:32:43,589
- Jim!
- It's not what it looks like.

522
00:32:50,053 --> 00:32:52,347
Well, we'll just tell your
mother that, uh... that, uh...

00:32:53,265 --> 00:32:55,726

Goal by number eight, Chris Ostreicher.

525
00:33:41,146 --> 00:33:43,148
- Nice game.
- Nice game. Good game.

526
00:33:47,027 --> 00:33:49,988
Hey, what are
you doin' here?

527
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:53,492
Just enjoying my first exhilarating
lacrosse experience.

528
00:33:53,534 --> 00:33:56,119
- You kicked butt.
- Oh, thanks.

529
00:33:56,161 --> 00:33:59,164
- Um, Chris...
- Oh, you can call me Oz, if you want.

530
00:33:59,248 --> 00:34:01,625
- Do I have to?
- You can call me Ostreicher.

531
00:34:01,667 --> 00:34:03,836
- What's your middle name?
- Nah, forget it.

532
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:07,464
- Come on. I won't tell anyone.
- Well, neither will I.

533
00:34:07,548 --> 00:34:11,176
Okay. Um.

534
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:14,763
So, I had this thought and...

535
00:34:14,847 --> 00:34:17,099
It may seem like
it's way out of left field.

536
00:34:17,182 --> 00:34:21,770
I don't know if you can, but since I'm not
going with anybody, I thought that maybe...

537
00:34:21,854 --> 00:34:24,523
Those guys sucked ass!

538
00:34:24,565 --> 00:34:26,775
Choir chick, what the hell
are you doing here?

539
00:34:26,859 --> 00:34:31,655
Well, uh, I was
asking Chris to prom.

540
00:34:31,738 --> 00:34:33,699
So, do you
want to go?

541
00:34:33,782 --> 00:34:37,244
Oh, yeah!
That would be great.

542
00:34:37,327 --> 00:34:40,581
Well, just don't
expect Oz to pay for the limo!

543
00:34:40,664 --> 00:34:43,709
Stifler, fuck!
I mean...

544
00:34:43,792 --> 00:34:48,297
Why do you got to be so
insensitive all the time?

545
00:34:48,338 --> 00:34:51,675
What?

546
00:34:51,758 --> 00:34:55,137

Hey, wait up, you pussies.
Where you goin'?

549
00:35:00,309 --> 00:35:05,647
Ah, well, I gotta...
I gotta hit the showers now,

551

- Yeah. Me too.

552
00:35:13,113 --> 00:35:15,908

577
00:36:56,633 --> 00:36:59,928
Hi, I was just looking
at the old family portrait out here.

578
00:37:00,012 --> 00:37:02,681
Well, that was
a fun day wasn't it?

- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

580
00:37:05,225 --> 00:37:09,521
Jim, I want to talk
about masturbation.

581
00:37:09,813 --> 00:37:14,067
Now, I just want you to know that
it's-it's a perfectly normal, uh, thing.

582
00:37:14,151 --> 00:37:16,278
And I have
to admit, uh, you know.

583
00:37:16,361 --> 00:37:20,824
I did a fair bit of masturbating
when I was a little younger.

584
00:37:20,908 --> 00:37:25,037
I, uh... I used to call it
"stroking the salami."

585
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,748
Yeah, you know,
"pounding the ol' pud."

586
00:37:27,789 --> 00:37:30,459
I never did it
with baked goods.

587
00:37:30,542 --> 00:37:35,047
But you know your Uncle Mort? He "pinched
the one-eyed snake" five, six times a day.

588
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:39,301
See, it's like, uh,
practice for the big game.

589
00:37:39,384 --> 00:37:42,513
You see?
It's like... It's like...

590
00:37:42,596 --> 00:37:45,474
banging a tennis ball
against a brick wall.

591
00:37:45,557 --> 00:37:49,520
Which can be fun.
It can be fun, but it's not a game.

592
00:37:49,561 --> 00:37:52,397
- Right. No.
- It's not a game.

593
00:37:52,481 --> 00:37:55,901
What you want is you want
a partner to return the ball.

594
00:37:55,984 --> 00:37:59,530
- Do you want a partner?
- Yeah. Yeah-Yeah, I want a partner.

595
00:37:59,613 --> 00:38:01,532
- You do want a partner?
- Oh, I want a partner.

596
00:38:01,573 --> 00:38:05,619
- Want a partner. Good. Good.
- Of course.

597
00:38:05,702 --> 00:38:07,579
Good.

598
00:38:07,663 --> 00:38:12,125
So, once Hal becomes king,
he has to take on...

599
00:38:12,209 --> 00:38:14,586
the responsibilities of leadership
and turn his back...

600
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:16,964
on his old,
drunken friend, Falstaff.

601
00:38:17,005 --> 00:38:21,760
You see, Hal is going through a...
rite of passage, much like you all are.

602
00:38:21,844 --> 00:38:25,681
So make most of the time you've got
left together. You'll miss it later.

603
00:38:25,764 --> 00:38:28,392
So, does your tongue cramp up?

604
00:38:28,475 --> 00:38:32,563
Nah. You get kind of dizzy, though.

605
00:38:32,646 --> 00:38:36,525
That's amazing. She's probably
gonna want to do it soon.

606
00:38:37,818 --> 00:38:41,780
All right. Class dismissed.

607
00:38:44,241 --> 00:38:48,829
Still questing after the Holy Grail,
huh, guys?

608
00:38:52,249 --> 00:38:54,251
Hey, uh,
where's Finch?

609
00:38:54,334 --> 00:38:56,378
Oh, he went home to take a shit.

610
00:38:56,461 --> 00:38:58,422
I don't get it.
I just don't.

611
00:38:58,505 --> 00:39:01,341
How does a guy like that
get this sudden reputation?

612
00:39:01,383 --> 00:39:04,887
- What reputation?
- Observe.

613
00:39:04,928 --> 00:39:08,932
Ex-Excuse me.
Do you know who Paul Finch is?

614
00:39:09,016 --> 00:39:12,394
Yeah! He's the guy
with the tattoo, right?

615
00:39:12,436 --> 00:39:18,192
You know, the eagle and the
blazing fire and that stuff.

616
00:39:18,275 --> 00:39:22,029
Well, um, if you guys see him later,
will you tell him Courtney says hi?

617
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:24,531
Bye.

618
00:39:24,615 --> 00:39:28,619
Okay. Explain.

619
00:39:28,702 --> 00:39:31,663
I can't. I don't
know how he's doing it.

620
00:39:31,705 --> 00:39:35,000
I, uh... I guess that
just leaves Jim trailing.

621
00:39:35,083 --> 00:39:37,294
- Aw, Jimbo!
- Better sack up, buddy!

622
00:39:37,336 --> 00:39:39,463
Yeah, I know.
I'm working on it, all right?

623
00:39:39,546 --> 00:39:41,673
James?

624
00:39:41,757 --> 00:39:43,717
You are very good
in the world history class, yes?

625
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:47,888
Me? Y-Yes. No, uh...

626
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:51,433
- Yes, I am.
- Perhaps you could help
me with my studies.

627
00:39:51,475 --> 00:39:53,644
Uh, yeah. Absolutely.

628
00:39:53,727 --> 00:39:55,729
Tha-Tha-Tha... That would be...
That would be great sometime.

629
00:39:55,812 --> 00:40:00,400
- How about tomorrow?
- Well, I have ballet practice.

630
00:40:00,442 --> 00:40:03,612
Perhaps I could come
by your house afterwards?

631
00:40:03,695 --> 00:40:05,948
I could change
clothes at your place.

632
00:40:07,574 --> 00:40:11,328
Oh. Uh... yeah.

633
00:40:11,411 --> 00:40:15,374
I suppose that
would be okay. Sure.

634
00:40:21,088 --> 00:40:25,884
Nice car!

635
00:40:25,968 --> 00:40:28,387
- I'm glad you think so.
- You don't like it?

636
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:31,807
No, I like the car.
By the way, though, about prom?

637
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:34,893
That was a bad idea.
I'm sorry I invited you.

638
00:40:34,935 --> 00:40:37,980
- What are you talkin' about?
- Please.

639
00:40:38,021 --> 00:40:41,608
I asked you because I thought you might
actually be worth going with.

640
00:40:41,692 --> 00:40:45,320
But you are just a jock.
No, wait. You're a jerk.

641
00:40:45,404 --> 00:40:48,323
Wait!
I don't understand.

642
00:40:48,407 --> 00:40:51,743
I saw you making fun of me
with your lacrosse buddies.

643
00:40:51,827 --> 00:40:53,954
Heather, I wasn't
makin' fun of you.

644
00:40:54,037 --> 00:40:56,582
Gimme a break.
You're so full of it.

645
00:40:59,793 --> 00:41:04,882
Fuck me! There's gonna be an Eastern
European chick naked in your house.

646
00:41:04,965 --> 00:41:07,092
And you're not gonna
do anything about that?

647
00:41:07,176 --> 00:41:10,971
What am I gonna do, huh?
Broadcast her over the Internet?

648
00:41:11,054 --> 00:41:14,516
- Yeah.
- You can do that?

649
00:41:18,437 --> 00:41:22,107
No. I cannot do that to her.

650
00:41:22,191 --> 00:41:25,569
Jim, get some fuckin' balls.

651
00:41:25,652 --> 00:41:30,449
If you don't have the guts to photograph a
naked chick, how you gonna sleep with one?

652
00:41:30,532 --> 00:41:33,202
I don't like the kid,
but he's got a point.

653
00:41:33,243 --> 00:41:36,497
See, even shit-brick
knows you should do it.

654
00:41:36,538 --> 00:41:40,083
All you gotta do is set up some sort of
private link or whatever on the 'Net...

655
00:41:40,167 --> 00:41:42,127
and tell me the address.

656
00:41:42,211 --> 00:41:45,005
You can send me
the address too.

657
00:41:45,088 --> 00:41:48,008
I'll save
you a seat.

I want to thicken-up that solo.

00:42:13,408 --> 00:42:15,661
Michigan State is this Saturday,
and I want that part to smoke.

Yeah, I know,

No, it's not that. I think it'll
work better as a duet with a tenor part.

Yeah? Well,
you can't fake this.

673
00:42:43,355 --> 00:42:46,483

Come in.

675
00:43:00,581 --> 00:43:05,169
Jim? There's a, uh...
a young lady here to see you.

676
00:43:05,252 --> 00:43:07,504
- Hey, Nadia.
- Hi, James. Ready to study?

677
00:43:07,588 --> 00:43:10,299
Oh, he's always ready to study.
He's a real bookworm, this kid.

678
00:43:10,382 --> 00:43:13,886
- Dad.
- That means... He's not-not
one of those nerdy guys but...

679
00:43:13,969 --> 00:43:18,807
- Dad!
- Well, I'll... I'll
let you two hit the books.

680
00:43:22,936 --> 00:43:25,981
You want a beer?

681
00:43:26,064 --> 00:43:29,860
- Oh, there we go.
- Come on, move!

682

Oh, you need to...
You need to change, right?

685
00:43:38,911 --> 00:43:41,538
- Uhh, do you mind?
- No. N-No, not at all.

686
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:45,459
Uh, please, you know.
Just go ahead and get un... get changed.

687
00:43:45,542 --> 00:43:48,921
I'll, uh... I'll
go downstairs and start studying up.

688
00:43:49,004 --> 00:43:50,839
- Yeah.
- Okay.

689
00:43:50,881 --> 00:43:53,634

- Oh, no. Oh, no.

- Oh, nice collection there, Jim.

She's gonna leave.
She's definitely gonna...

716
00:45:39,573 --> 00:45:42,242
She's getting comfortable.
She's not gonna leave.

717
00:45:42,284 --> 00:45:44,995
She reads
the articles.

718

Is she?

719
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:04,348
She's goin' downstairs.

- Oh, my God!
- Jackpot, baby!

721
00:46:17,361 --> 00:46:20,656
- Can you believe this?
- Nadia, I would have never known.

722
00:46:20,739 --> 00:46:23,534
I have an announcement
that I would like to make.

723
00:46:23,617 --> 00:46:27,496
There is a gorgeous woman...
masturbating on my bed!

724

with Nadia, this is it.

supposed to do, Kev?
- Seduce her.

Wha... What the hell
would I say?

727
00:46:40,843 --> 00:46:44,221
Go over there and ask her
if she needs an extra hand.

728
00:46:44,304 --> 00:46:48,225

you know that?

not good with girls, period.

833
00:54:06,497 --> 00:54:10,042
No-no-no, really-really. Like... Like I
was born without that part of the brain.

834
00:54:10,083 --> 00:54:12,252
I mean, I can't
talk to girls.

835
00:54:12,336 --> 00:54:14,379
And when I do talk
to them, I screw it up.

836
00:54:14,463 --> 00:54:17,549
Yeah, well, come prom those excuses
aren't going to do you any good.

837
00:54:19,092 --> 00:54:23,013
And one time at band camp,

838
00:54:23,096 --> 00:54:25,307
we weren't supposed
to have pillow fights,

839
00:54:25,390 --> 00:54:28,435
but we had a pillow fight,
and it was so much fun.

840
00:54:28,519 --> 00:54:33,482
A... And this one time, we all lost our music
and we were supposed to play this song,

841
00:54:33,565 --> 00:54:38,821
but we didn't know it, so we just made
it up and we kept playing and playing,

842
00:54:38,904 --> 00:54:42,866
and the conductor didn't know
what we were doing, and it was so funny.

843
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:45,369
So, you're pissed about somethin', huh.

844
00:54:45,452 --> 00:54:47,371
You know what
I do when I'm angry?

845
00:54:47,454 --> 00:54:50,624
I just play some Bach on my flute.
It's so relaxing.

846
00:54:50,666 --> 00:54:53,877
- I learned to do that at band camp.
- Hold on, uh...

847
00:54:53,961 --> 00:54:57,297
You have no idea
why I'm angry?

848
00:54:57,381 --> 00:55:00,592
Is it because we have a test tomorrow?
Sometimes I get cranky...

849
00:55:00,676 --> 00:55:03,929
when I know I have
a big test to study for.

850
00:55:03,971 --> 00:55:08,308
- Yeah. Yeah, that's pretty much it.
- I thought so...

851
00:55:08,392 --> 00:55:11,103
- because this one time at band camp...
- W-What's your name?

852
00:55:11,145 --> 00:55:13,021
- Michelle.
- O-Okay.

853
00:55:13,105 --> 00:55:15,065
Michelle, um...

854
00:55:15,149 --> 00:55:17,943
Do you want to be
my date for the prom?

855
00:55:18,026 --> 00:55:21,405
Really? You seriously
want to go with me?

856
00:55:24,992 --> 00:55:28,120
Yes. Seriously.

857
00:55:28,203 --> 00:55:31,790
Are we going to Steve Stifler's party
afterwards? Because that would be so cool.

858
00:55:31,874 --> 00:55:37,212
- Sure, whatever you want.
- Cool! We're gonna have
such a good time.

859
00:55:37,254 --> 00:55:42,426
It'll be like this one time at band camp
when we all had a campfire...

860
00:55:57,191 --> 00:56:00,277
Hi.

861
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:03,947
- How'd you know I was here?
- Stifler told me.

862
00:56:04,031 --> 00:56:07,451
- Talked to Stifler?
- Well, I needed to find you.

863
00:56:07,493 --> 00:56:09,620
We're gonna have
to work on that song.

864
00:56:10,829 --> 00:56:13,790
Okay.
I'm glad you came by.

865
00:56:13,832 --> 00:56:16,084
So you work nights?

866
00:56:18,378 --> 00:56:21,215
- My dad's the manager.
- Really?

867
00:56:21,256 --> 00:56:24,343
Cool. Tell him
the subs are great.

868
00:56:26,428 --> 00:56:29,306
- So you're going to Michigan next year?
- Yeah.

869
00:56:29,389 --> 00:56:32,142
My parents want me to go
to Northwestern, but...

870
00:56:32,226 --> 00:56:35,103
I don't wanna write all those
extra essays they make you do.

871
00:56:35,145 --> 00:56:40,943
I mean, how am I supposed to know what my
"most emotionally significant moment" was?

872
00:56:41,026 --> 00:56:45,572
So when my "U" of "M" acceptance came in
December, I just said the hell with it.

873
00:56:45,656 --> 00:56:47,658
- Onions?
- What?

874
00:56:47,741 --> 00:56:50,285
You, uh, want onions?

875
00:56:50,369 --> 00:56:52,287
Oh, no, thank you.

876
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:57,668
So what are you
gonna major in?

877
00:56:57,709 --> 00:57:01,797
State's got a good business school, and I
could probably walk-on to the lacrosse team.

878
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:05,759
Well, you've probably got it
pretty figured out, then, huh?

879
00:57:05,843 --> 00:57:09,429
I mean, business is okay,
and lacrosse is awesome, but...

880
00:57:09,513 --> 00:57:12,599
what am I gonna be,
a professional lacrosse player?

881
00:57:12,683 --> 00:57:14,643
I really have no idea.

882
00:57:14,685 --> 00:57:18,063
Thank God.
I thought I was the only one.

883
00:57:18,147 --> 00:57:20,065
Well, you're not.

884
00:57:21,525 --> 00:57:23,569
So we're gonna be
close next year.

885
00:57:31,535 --> 00:57:33,453
You mean East Lansing
and Ann Arbor?

886
00:57:33,537 --> 00:57:36,874
Yeah.

887
00:57:36,957 --> 00:57:38,876
What are you
talkin' about?

888
00:57:38,917 --> 00:57:42,963
I can't go to the prom with you.
I'm holding out for someone else.

889
00:57:43,046 --> 00:57:45,215
You gotta be fuckin' kidding me.

890
00:57:45,299 --> 00:57:49,678
I know it's a long shot, but I figure
Paul Finch might ask me.

891
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:53,765
Finch.
Shit-brick.

892
00:57:53,849 --> 00:57:56,518
Oh, gosh.
I-I forgot.

893
00:57:56,602 --> 00:57:59,021
You look okay.

894
00:57:59,104 --> 00:58:02,608
I-I mean, the scars
healed really well.

895
00:58:02,691 --> 00:58:04,610
- Hey, Stifler.
- Eat shit.

896
00:58:07,446 --> 00:58:09,406
What was that
all about?

897
00:58:09,490 --> 00:58:13,869
- He's still embarrassed
because Finch kicked his ass.
- Who told you that?

898
00:58:13,952 --> 00:58:16,121
What do you mean,
"no comment"?

899
00:58:16,163 --> 00:58:19,249
- Did you two hook up or something?
- What, are you kidding? No.

900
00:58:19,333 --> 00:58:22,878
Then how did all this
get started?

901
00:58:22,961 --> 00:58:26,173
Well, I guess it's all right
for me to tell you now.

902
00:58:26,256 --> 00:58:29,426
That reputation of his isn't
going anywhere. Cheese, please.

903
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:32,471
Finch comes up to me
and says, "Jessica,

904
00:58:32,554 --> 00:58:35,182
I need your help with this,
blah, blah, etcetera."

905
00:58:35,265 --> 00:58:37,601
So I said, "All right.
Pay me 200 bucks,

906
00:58:37,684 --> 00:58:40,562
and I'll tell a couple of girls
that you're dynamite in bed."

907
00:58:40,604 --> 00:58:43,398
So he did,
and I did.

908
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:45,526
- That actually works?
- Well, duh! Of course.

909
00:58:45,609 --> 00:58:48,153
Naturally, I embellished
a little bit.

910
00:58:48,195 --> 00:58:50,697
Did you hear that Finch had
an affair with an older woman?

911
00:58:50,781 --> 00:58:52,741
No, I didn't hear that one.

912
00:58:52,783 --> 00:58:55,369
That one was my favorite.

913
00:58:55,452 --> 00:58:57,454
Do that cheerleader.

914
00:58:57,538 --> 00:59:01,041
- <i>♪ Thank you, baby ♪</i>
- She wants me. She calls me up...

915
00:59:01,124 --> 00:59:05,587
<i>♪ How sweet it is
to be loved by you ♪</i>

916
00:59:05,671 --> 00:59:08,799
Oh, my God,
you're gay!

917
00:59:08,882 --> 00:59:10,801
Sing it with me.
You know the words.

918
00:59:10,884 --> 00:59:14,096
No, thanks, man. You've been
singin' that shit all week.

919
00:59:14,179 --> 00:59:17,850
If you try that at M.S.U.
This Saturday, I'll kick your ass.

920
00:59:17,933 --> 00:59:19,935
Our last game
is this Saturday.

921
00:59:20,018 --> 00:59:22,146
Yeah, well, shit.

922
00:59:25,065 --> 00:59:29,111
I've got this lacrosse game. It's
really important. It's our last game.

923
00:59:29,194 --> 00:59:32,948
Central almost beat us last time, so
this time I really wanna kick their ass.

924
00:59:33,073 --> 00:59:35,784
But it's gonna be cool,
because the game's at State,

925
00:59:35,868 --> 00:59:38,453
which means afterwards
I'll be able to stop by.

926
00:59:38,495 --> 00:59:40,497
So you can't sing
at the competition.

927
00:59:40,581 --> 00:59:43,292
Heather, I'm sorry.
I totally blew it.

928
00:59:43,375 --> 00:59:48,088
It's okay. You should...
do what makes you happy.

929
00:59:49,715 --> 00:59:53,427
All right. Listen,
thanks for understanding.

930
00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:56,013
Yeah.

931
00:59:56,054 --> 00:59:59,099
So, uh, I guess
I'll see you later?

932
01:00:13,864 --> 01:00:17,034
Hey, Kevin.

933
01:00:17,117 --> 01:00:22,164
- You seen shit-brick lately?
- Why? What did you do to him?

934
01:00:22,206 --> 01:00:24,333
Me? Nothing.

935
01:00:24,374 --> 01:00:26,668
See, I'm the one
whose ass he kicked.

936
01:00:26,752 --> 01:00:30,214
But, uh, I'll tell you
one thing, though.

937
01:00:30,297 --> 01:00:33,509
I don't think he's gonna have a problem
shitting in school anymore.

938
01:00:33,592 --> 01:00:35,594
Slipped a little something
into his mochaccino.

939
01:00:38,055 --> 01:00:40,724
Oh, God!

940
01:00:41,809 --> 01:00:43,936
Oh! Oh!

941
01:00:50,150 --> 01:00:52,444
Jesus.

942
01:00:52,486 --> 01:00:55,030
Right this way,
sir.

943
01:01:00,452 --> 01:01:04,373
Oh, God.

944
01:01:32,192 --> 01:01:35,154
Oh, no.

945
01:01:35,529 --> 01:01:37,698
It's gonna be fun.

946
01:01:37,781 --> 01:01:40,325
You know it's just gonna be
some crappy band and stupid decorations.

947
01:01:40,409 --> 01:01:44,037
You're just saying that because prom's
a week away and you don't have a date.

948
01:01:44,121 --> 01:01:46,582
No, no, no.
I don't want a date.

949
01:01:46,665 --> 01:01:51,170
Finch is goin' stag and... so am I.

950
01:01:51,253 --> 01:01:54,506
God, he's like so...
refined.

951
01:01:54,590 --> 01:01:57,759
You think that
older woman thing is true?

952
01:01:57,801 --> 01:02:01,138
Yeah, it's true.
It was Stifler's mom.

953
01:02:03,182 --> 01:02:06,518
Joanie, was that you?

954
01:02:06,602 --> 01:02:08,896
- Oh!
- Can't hold it.

955
01:02:08,937 --> 01:02:11,982
Oh!

956
01:02:15,944 --> 01:02:18,030

Yeah!

958
01:02:45,057 --> 01:02:48,018
Kev?
I think we've come...

959
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:51,647
- a really long way since homecoming.
- Yeah, we have.

960
01:02:51,730 --> 01:02:53,649
Maybe it's time...

961
01:02:53,732 --> 01:02:57,694
we start to express ourselves
in new ways.

962
01:02:57,778 --> 01:03:00,030
- Yeah.
- You wanna do it?

963
01:03:00,113 --> 01:03:02,908
- Yeah.
- I love you.

964
01:03:04,618 --> 01:03:07,246
It's your turn.

965
01:03:08,288 --> 01:03:10,749
That's not
what I was thinking.

966
01:03:10,791 --> 01:03:14,878
Sex. It's always
about sex.

967
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:18,048
It's not
always about sex.

968
01:03:18,090 --> 01:03:21,218
I just thought it was
about sex this time.

969
01:03:24,596 --> 01:03:28,934
Look, Vicky, love is a term
that gets thrown around,

970
01:03:28,976 --> 01:03:30,936
and-and people
don't mean it.

971
01:03:31,019 --> 01:03:34,231
When I say it, I want it
to be more than words.

972
01:03:34,273 --> 01:03:37,025
- You know? I want it to be...
- Perfect.

973
01:03:39,111 --> 01:03:41,071
Exactly.

974
01:03:41,238 --> 01:03:43,949
- Okay, Albert.
You ready?
- No problemo.

You know... sex.
Does it hurt?

01:08:09,590 --> 01:08:14,011
Yeah. I mean, the first time you do it,
you know, it hurts.

1038
01:08:14,052 --> 01:08:18,223
But then you, you do it again

And I'll wish I would've
done it with Kevin.

1044
01:08:36,116 --> 01:08:38,368
So go do it with Kevin.

1045
01:08:38,452 --> 01:08:41,538
- You think?
- Yeah. You're... You're ready.

1046
01:08:41,622 --> 01:08:45,959
- You're woman. Look at you.
You're ready for sex.
- You're right.

1047
01:08:46,001 --> 01:08:48,420
- I know.
- I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna have sex.

1048
01:08:48,504 --> 01:08:51,131
- Now.
- And it's gonna be right, and
it's gonna be just perfect.

1049
01:08:51,173 --> 01:08:53,300
- Perfect sex.
- Thanks, Jessica.

1050
01:08:53,467 --> 01:08:55,886
Please.

1051
01:08:55,969 --> 01:08:58,764
Kevin.

1052
01:08:58,847 --> 01:09:00,891
Kevin.

1053
01:09:02,476 --> 01:09:05,896
- I wanna have sex.
- Now?

1054
01:09:11,151 --> 01:09:13,195

01:10:04,746 --> 01:10:07,833
- Michelle.
- Yeah.

1068
01:10:07,916 --> 01:10:12,087

- Oh, she's special, all right.

1069
01:10:12,171 --> 01:10:15,174
I'm sure she is special if you
picked her out of the whole bunch.

1070
01:10:17,885 --> 01:10:20,637

1093
01:12:14,543 --> 01:12:18,338
Finch, we know where you are,
but can't really use that as an excuse.

1094
01:12:18,422 --> 01:12:20,340
Jim?

1095
01:12:20,424 --> 01:12:24,678
Uh, my date's a flute-toting band dork.
Does that answer your question?

1096
01:12:24,761 --> 01:12:28,223
Oz, is this vocal-jazz shit
gonna pay off or what?

1097
01:12:28,307 --> 01:12:31,059
Kevin, what's with
the attitude?

1098
01:12:31,143 --> 01:12:34,062
Attitude? Me?

1099
01:12:34,146 --> 01:12:36,773
I think you guys should be
a little more enthusiastic.

1100
01:12:36,857 --> 01:12:39,359
This is the night
we've been waiting for.

1101
01:12:39,401 --> 01:12:41,528
We're in this together.
You guys can't back out.

1102
01:12:41,612 --> 01:12:45,240
Kev, you don't need us to get laid.
Are you afraid or something?

1103
01:12:45,324 --> 01:12:48,744
No. Come on.
We made a pact.

1104
01:12:48,827 --> 01:12:52,247
You can't break that.
You guys are gonna have to...

1105
01:12:52,331 --> 01:12:56,168
Have to what, Kev, huh?
I don't have to do shit.

1106
01:12:56,210 --> 01:12:59,630
Forget it already. I am so sick
and tired of all this bullshit pressure.

1107
01:12:59,713 --> 01:13:04,468
I've never even had sex, and already,
I can't stand it. I hate sex!

1108
01:13:04,510 --> 01:13:07,513
And I'm not gonna stand around here
busting my balls over something that,

1109
01:13:07,554 --> 01:13:09,932
quite frankly,
isn't that damn important.

1110
01:13:10,015 --> 01:13:12,142
I'm gonna go hang out
with that geek over there...

1111
01:13:12,226 --> 01:13:15,312
'cause at least she has something else
to talk about besides sex.

1112
01:13:15,395 --> 01:13:17,356
Goddamn.

1113
01:13:19,358 --> 01:13:22,069
Yeah.

1114
01:13:22,152 --> 01:13:25,489
You know, at least I learned
how to shit in school, buddy.

1115
01:13:25,572 --> 01:13:27,533
Hey, Finch.

1116
01:13:27,616 --> 01:13:30,327
- Wanna dance?
- Yeah.

1117
01:13:35,707 --> 01:13:39,127
- How come you have no date?
- I like to keep my options open.

1118
01:13:39,211 --> 01:13:41,129
I got something for you.

1119
01:13:43,048 --> 01:13:45,551
Consider it
a consolation prize.

1120
01:13:48,595 --> 01:13:51,557
Jessica, this is great!

1121
01:13:51,598 --> 01:13:55,978
- Felt sorta guilty
about taking your money.
- You spent $200 on this?

1122
01:13:56,061 --> 01:13:59,273
<i>No, I spent 50 on the flask,
150 on the earrings.</i>

1123
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:03,360
- These are, uh...
- Let me just clarify...

1124
01:14:03,402 --> 01:14:07,865
- that you have no chance
of scoring with me, Finch.
- Of course not!

1125
01:14:07,906 --> 01:14:10,492
So I take it you and Sherman
are pretty close, huh?

1126
01:14:10,576 --> 01:14:12,578
You met at that party
a while back, right?

1127
01:14:12,661 --> 01:14:14,580
Yeah, we were
up all night together.

1128
01:14:14,663 --> 01:14:17,749
We had one of those
amazingly deep conversations...

1129
01:14:17,833 --> 01:14:20,794
where you feel like
you really get to know someone.

1130
01:14:20,878 --> 01:14:24,173
Deep conversation, huh?

1131
01:14:24,256 --> 01:14:26,466
Is that
what you call it?

1132
01:14:26,550 --> 01:14:28,510
What else
would I call it?

1133
01:14:35,350 --> 01:14:37,311
Thank you, Great Falls.

1134
01:14:37,352 --> 01:14:40,355
We're gonna take a little break.
You are beautiful.

1135
01:14:44,735 --> 01:14:46,653
You suck!

1136
01:14:49,573 --> 01:14:52,159
Excuse me, everyone.

1137
01:14:52,242 --> 01:14:54,411
Sorry to interrupt.

1138
01:14:54,453 --> 01:14:56,830
I just thought
you all should know this.

1139
01:14:56,914 --> 01:14:59,583
Chuck Sherman is a liar.

1140
01:14:59,625 --> 01:15:01,919
I never had sex with him.

1141
01:15:02,002 --> 01:15:06,423
He's never had sex with anyone.
I know this because he told me.

1142
01:15:06,465 --> 01:15:10,344
Once he tried to screw
a grapefruit, but that's all.

1143
01:15:10,385 --> 01:15:13,722
Oh. He also told me that when he gets
nervous, he sometimes wets his pants.

1144
01:15:13,806 --> 01:15:18,101
Thank you for your time.

1145
01:15:30,572 --> 01:15:33,826
- Guess what?
- Not interested.

1146
01:15:33,909 --> 01:15:38,205
Kevin. Come on, man. The bus
to Stifler's is gonna be here soon.

1147
01:15:38,288 --> 01:15:40,207
- I'm not going.
- What?

1148
01:15:40,290 --> 01:15:43,836
Why not?

1149
01:15:43,919 --> 01:15:48,674
Look, things didn't really
turn out how I wanted them to.

1150
01:15:48,757 --> 01:15:51,134
I mean, I don't even
know what I'm doin'.

1151
01:15:51,176 --> 01:15:54,596
I-I'm acting like I've got
everything together tonight.

1152
01:15:54,638 --> 01:15:58,350
I know that Vicky's gonna
ask me if I love her, and...

1153
01:15:58,433 --> 01:16:00,352
I don't know
what I'm gonna say.

1154
01:16:00,435 --> 01:16:02,396
I mean,
I'm on the brink.

1155
01:16:02,437 --> 01:16:06,024
I'm just about to do it.
I should be psyched.

1156
01:16:06,108 --> 01:16:10,195
I don't know. Maybe you're right.
Maybe I am just scared.

1157
01:16:10,279 --> 01:16:14,366
Come on, Kev.
Tonight is the night.

1158
01:16:14,449 --> 01:16:17,578
We-We are finally going
to a post-prom party on the lake.

1159
01:16:17,661 --> 01:16:19,997
We have been waiting for this
for four years.

1160
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:23,167
Why else have we been friends
with Stifler all this time, right?

1161
01:16:24,126 --> 01:16:26,545
We were friends
with Stifler?

1162
01:16:26,587 --> 01:16:28,714
Hey, look.

1163
01:16:29,923 --> 01:16:32,676
Sherman didn't even
get laid.

1164
01:16:32,718 --> 01:16:35,471
- He didn't?
- No, he pissed himself.

1165
01:16:35,554 --> 01:16:37,681
What?

1166
01:16:39,349 --> 01:16:41,351
We'll tell you
on the bus.

1167
01:16:41,393 --> 01:16:44,563
I'm gonna go inside
and grab my bag.

1168
01:16:44,646 --> 01:16:47,149
My date too, perhaps?

1169
01:16:48,817 --> 01:16:50,986
Stifler's mom
got it in the divorce.

1170
01:16:51,069 --> 01:16:52,988
That reminds me
of this one time...

1171
01:16:53,071 --> 01:16:55,991
Hey, can I ask you
a question?

1172
01:16:56,074 --> 01:16:58,744
How come you don't have any stories?
I've got lots of them,

1173
01:16:58,785 --> 01:17:01,038
and you don't have any.

1174
01:17:01,121 --> 01:17:04,291
Oh, I've got stories.
Believe me. They're just, uh...

1175
01:17:04,374 --> 01:17:07,127
They're just a little
more risque than tales of band camp.

1176
01:17:07,211 --> 01:17:11,757
Are they gross or something?
Like guy stuff? Tell me!

1177
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:13,759
Okay.
You want a story?

1178
01:17:13,842 --> 01:17:16,428
Here's a story.
Stifler finds this beer...

1179
01:17:19,598 --> 01:17:23,894
- This is the nicest room in the house.
- Kev, it's perfect.

1180
01:17:34,696 --> 01:17:38,367
You guys are gonna fuck, aren't ya?

1181
01:17:38,450 --> 01:17:41,036
Fuckers!
Fuckers, fuckers!

1182
01:17:41,119 --> 01:17:43,372
Fuckers,
fuckers, fuckers!

1183
01:17:44,790 --> 01:17:47,417
- Out.
- Aw, come on!

1184
01:17:47,501 --> 01:17:49,920
- Get out.
- Aw, man!

1185
01:18:07,980 --> 01:18:09,982
There's something
I've been meaning to tell you, Heather.

1186
01:18:10,065 --> 01:18:12,401
What's that?

1187
01:18:12,484 --> 01:18:14,778
It's gonna sound
really bad, but, uh,

1188
01:18:14,820 --> 01:18:17,447
I want you to know.

1189
01:18:17,531 --> 01:18:20,242
You see, uh,

1190
01:18:20,284 --> 01:18:24,580
I'm a virgin,
and, uh...

1191
01:18:24,621 --> 01:18:27,291
Well, me, Kevin, Jim
and Finch were...

1192
01:18:27,374 --> 01:18:30,085
We all made this pact...

1193
01:18:30,210 --> 01:18:33,046
that we would
lose our virginity...

1194
01:18:33,088 --> 01:18:35,174
before high school
was over,

1195
01:18:35,257 --> 01:18:38,302
and tonight is supposed
to be the night that we all do it.

1196
01:18:40,304 --> 01:18:42,389
This isn't the best way
to proposition me.

1197
01:18:42,473 --> 01:18:45,267
No, that's...
That's not what I mean.

1198
01:18:45,350 --> 01:18:48,520
W- What I mean is, uh...

1199
01:18:48,604 --> 01:18:51,356
Look, do you know
what made me leave that game?

1200
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:55,486
See, Coach, he was givin' us
this speech about...

1201
01:18:55,527 --> 01:18:58,238
not slacking off when you see
the opportunity to score...

1202
01:18:58,322 --> 01:19:00,365
This isn't any better,
Chris.

1203
01:19:00,449 --> 01:19:02,534
No, you see...
You see, Heather,

1204
01:19:02,618 --> 01:19:05,037
what I realized is that...

1205
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:10,000
with you, it's...
not like I'm running towards a goal...

1206
01:19:10,083 --> 01:19:13,420
looking for
the best way to score.

1207
01:19:13,462 --> 01:19:17,007
This may sound
a little corny, but...

1208
01:19:17,090 --> 01:19:19,301
I feel like
I've already won.

1209
01:19:21,845 --> 01:19:26,266
And, uh,
I care about you a lot.

1210
01:19:27,476 --> 01:19:29,770
Oz, I know.

1211
01:19:30,938 --> 01:19:34,274
- You called me Oz.
- Well, yeah.

1212
01:19:34,358 --> 01:19:36,276
It's what your friends
call you.

1213
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:39,363
I mean, I feel like I'm
one of your friends now.

1214
01:19:39,446 --> 01:19:43,200
And... your girlfriend?

1215
01:19:45,494 --> 01:19:49,998
<i>♪ Ain't never thought that
I could love like this ♪</i>

1216
01:19:50,082 --> 01:19:53,210
<i>♪ This feeling inside me

1217
01:19:53,293 --> 01:19:57,840

1218
01:20:16,984 --> 01:20:18,944
Are ya lost?

1219
01:20:23,490 --> 01:20:26,326
You're Stifler's mom.
Uh...

1220
01:20:26,410 --> 01:20:29,121
No, no, not lost.
Just, um,

1221
01:20:29,204 --> 01:20:31,123
you know,
taking the tour.

1222
01:20:33,625 --> 01:20:37,921
Hey, uh, thank you for letting
us have this wonderful party.

1223
01:20:37,963 --> 01:20:40,424
As if there was
an alternative in the matter.

1224
01:20:45,387 --> 01:20:47,806
So, you enjoying yourself?

1225
01:20:47,890 --> 01:20:51,351
I'm... three sheets
to the wind, ma'am.

1226
01:20:51,435 --> 01:20:53,770
I'm so happy for you.

1227
01:20:53,854 --> 01:20:55,772
But it takes the edge off,
doesn't it?

1228
01:20:57,774 --> 01:21:01,028
- Where's your little date tonight?
- No date. It was...

1229
01:21:01,111 --> 01:21:03,530
It was a bathroom incident.

1230
01:21:03,572 --> 01:21:08,160
- Pardon me?
- Never mind.

1231
01:21:11,955 --> 01:21:14,333
You have
anything to drink?

1232
01:21:14,416 --> 01:21:16,335
I believe the kegs
are upstairs.

1233
01:21:17,669 --> 01:21:20,172
That is what
the cretins drink.

1234
01:21:20,255 --> 01:21:22,341
I'm talking about
alcohol, liquor.

1235
01:21:22,424 --> 01:21:25,385
- The good stuff.
- All right.

1236
01:21:27,012 --> 01:21:28,972
I got some scotch.

1237
01:21:29,014 --> 01:21:33,644
<i>- Single malt?
- Aged 18 years.</i>

1238
01:21:33,727 --> 01:21:35,646
The way I like it.

1239
01:21:39,441 --> 01:21:41,652
Why don't you go
grab a glass from the bar?

1240
01:21:44,071 --> 01:21:46,740
I think I should.

1241
01:21:46,824 --> 01:21:48,784
Allow me.

1242
01:21:50,410 --> 01:21:52,329
You know it's
a bitchin' party.

1243
01:21:52,412 --> 01:21:54,873
The Stif-man
always comes through in the clutch.

1244
01:21:58,377 --> 01:22:01,839
And then he just
puked his brains out.

1245
01:22:01,922 --> 01:22:04,842
- That is a nasty story.
- Yep, I told you.

1246
01:22:04,883 --> 01:22:07,052
Do you want to hear
a nasty story of mine?

1247
01:22:07,136 --> 01:22:09,179
It's sort of sexual.

1248
01:22:11,140 --> 01:22:13,684
Yeah!
Yeah, let's hear it.

1249
01:22:13,767 --> 01:22:18,605
Okay, well, this one time at band camp,
we were playing this game.

1250
01:22:18,689 --> 01:22:22,359
I don't know if you know it,
but it's called "Spin the Bottle."

1251
01:22:22,401 --> 01:22:26,280
And I had to kiss this guy
named Mark Wander on the lips.

1252
01:22:26,363 --> 01:22:28,282
And-And he plays
trombone...

1253
01:22:28,365 --> 01:22:30,784
So how do you
want to be?

1254
01:22:30,868 --> 01:22:33,829
Like... how do you
want to do it?

1255
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:37,749
I don't know.
How do you?

1256
01:22:37,833 --> 01:22:42,588
Like... normal style.
The missionary position.

1257
01:22:44,298 --> 01:22:46,216
Okay.

1258
01:22:52,473 --> 01:22:54,600
Kev?

1259
01:22:54,683 --> 01:22:56,977
- Yeah?
- I wanna hear you say it.

1260
01:22:57,060 --> 01:22:59,480
Okay.

1261
01:23:02,399 --> 01:23:04,693
Victoria,

1262
01:23:04,776 --> 01:23:06,695
I love you.

1263
01:23:08,447 --> 01:23:11,158
I love you.

So the end of the story
is you...

1283
01:24:18,809 --> 01:24:20,894
had to kiss the guy
for 20 seconds.

1284
01:24:20,978 --> 01:24:24,940
Yes! And he was such a dork.
Everyone laughed at me...

1285
01:24:25,023 --> 01:24:29,153
- but I didn't care
because it was so funny.
- I get it.

1286
01:24:29,194 --> 01:24:32,990
And this one time at band camp,
I stuck a flute in my pussy.

1287
01:24:35,284 --> 01:24:37,411
Excuse me?

1288
01:24:37,494 --> 01:24:40,205
What? You don't think I know
how to get myself off?

1289
01:24:40,289 --> 01:24:43,709
Hell, that's what
half of band camp is... Sex Ed.

1290
01:24:43,792 --> 01:24:46,920
So are we gonna screw soon,
'cause I'm gettin' kinda antsy.

1291
01:24:56,013 --> 01:24:58,223
This'll do. Whoo-hoo!

1292
01:24:59,725 --> 01:25:04,146
Ow!

1293
01:25:04,229 --> 01:25:06,440
Now, I have two rubbers.
Wear them both. It'll desensitize you.

1294
01:25:06,482 --> 01:25:08,692
Now, I have two rubbers.
Wear them both. It'll desensitize you.

1295
01:25:08,734 --> 01:25:11,236
I don't want you coming
so damn early this time.

1296
01:25:13,447 --> 01:25:15,782
What makes you think
that I would come early?

1297
01:25:15,866 --> 01:25:19,953
Come on. I saw you on the 'Net.
Why do you think I accepted this date?

1298
01:25:19,995 --> 01:25:22,748
You're a sure thing.

1299
01:25:24,833 --> 01:25:27,669
Yes, I am.

1300
01:25:27,753 --> 01:25:32,424
So I said, "This is very obviously
a Piero della Francesca."

1301
01:25:39,723 --> 01:25:45,521
So, uh, would you object if I said
that you were quite striking?

1302
01:25:45,562 --> 01:25:50,526
Mr. Finch, are you
trying to seduce me?

Okay, let's go.

1326
01:27:04,224 --> 01:27:06,685
What's my name?
Say my name, bitch!

1327
01:27:06,727 --> 01:27:08,896
Michelle, Michelle.

1328
01:27:10,522 --> 01:27:12,441
Oh, God.

1329
01:27:40,135 --> 01:27:42,095
That was
a great night, huh?

1330
01:27:44,515 --> 01:27:46,433
Yeah.

1331
01:27:48,435 --> 01:27:51,438
I mean, I just can't believe
we had our senior prom.

1332
01:27:51,522 --> 01:27:55,400
I know.
It went by so fast.

1333
01:27:55,484 --> 01:27:58,111
Yeah, it did.

1334
01:27:58,195 --> 01:28:00,113
Kevin?

1335
01:28:04,868 --> 01:28:07,329
Next year with you
going to Ann Arbor...

1336
01:28:07,412 --> 01:28:10,541
and me going to Ithaca,

1337
01:28:10,624 --> 01:28:13,752
it's not gonna work,
is it?

1338
01:28:13,836 --> 01:28:15,838
No.
Don't say that.

1339
01:28:15,921 --> 01:28:18,423
I mean,
we could make it work.

1340
01:28:19,758 --> 01:28:22,427
- It'll be perfect.
- No, Kevin.

1341
01:28:24,179 --> 01:28:26,598
- But...
- See, that's what I've been realizing...

1342
01:28:26,682 --> 01:28:29,434
is that...
nothing's perfect.

1343
01:28:29,476 --> 01:28:33,981
And you can't
plan everything.

1344
01:28:34,064 --> 01:28:37,818
