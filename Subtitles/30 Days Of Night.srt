2
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:18,929
Strange.

3
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,993
Who'd do something like this?

4
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:26,436
Maybe someone got a little upset
about their roaming charges.

5
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,069
Stealing satellite phones
makes sense. You can hock them.

6
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:35,044
You can run up charges
on somebody else's account.

7
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:37,682
But burning them?

8
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:39,680
Youngsters?

9
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,717
Pulling some prank?

10
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:43,621
No.

11
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:46,315
They'd have left a note.

12
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:49,226
"Fuck you" to their parents...

13
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:51,928
...or the world or whatever.

14
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,395
Not a bad idea, though.

15
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:20,122
I brought Peggy here
on our first date.

16
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:22,260
Yeah, we all did.

17
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:26,728
Not Peggy, of course.

18
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,797
Yeah, I got you.

19
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,435
Last sunset in a month...

20
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:38,076
...always works.

21
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,743
Come on. Let's go do the sign.

22
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:50,645
You okay, Eben?

23
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:54,983
Yeah.

24
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:36,629
Why do you even bother with that?
Nobody's gonna see it for a month.

25
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,133
It's tradition.

26
00:05:58,057 --> 00:06:00,150
Put this off till the last minute,
didn't you?

27
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,022
There's a lot of small towns
in this state.

28
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:07,063
My boss wants all his gear inspected
and certified by the 31st.

29
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:10,295
And I noticed you saved
Barrow for the last.

30
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:15,203
You sure you don't wanna stay?

31
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:17,666
Me and Jeannie were hoping
you and Eben...

32
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:21,404
...might rethink
this separation thing.

33
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,611
Thanks.

34
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,485
I...

35
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,322
...gotta make the plane.

36
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:42,557
Okay, sweetie. I know you can't
handle a month with no sun.

37
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:45,704
I promise I won't live on
Oreos and Snapple, all right?

38
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:52,870
Have fun in Seattle.

39
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:57,709
Yeah. So long, Kirsten.
I'll call you when I get there.

40
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:00,984
Goodbye.

41
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:43,024
Got a problem?

42
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:47,365
Nothing I can't handle
my own fucking self.

43
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:55,304
This for generators?

44
00:07:57,777 --> 00:07:59,836
Yeah. Yeah, mostly.

45
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:04,380
Beau, I have to cite you for it.
I can't have it leaking on the street.

46
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:09,248
What?

47
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:13,753
For that? You don't...

48
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,919
You don't have to cite me.

49
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,989
You don't have to do anything.

50
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:26,128
Isn't that why we live out here?

51
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:28,972
You know, for a little freedom?

52
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:32,635
Happy motoring.

53
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:40,919
Yeah, I'll add it to my collection.

54
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:47,592
You know, Beau's not so bad.
Why'd you bother writing him up?

55
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:51,859
He lives all alone out there
on the south ridge.

56
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:56,200
A little citation now and then
lets him know he's a part of this town.

57
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:00,263
<i>Eben? Come in, Eben.</i>

58
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:03,764
Yeah, Helen.

59
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:07,070
<i>Something bad's happened
to John Riis' dogs.</i>

60
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:18,989
<i>Well, folks, you're listening
to KBRW, Barrow, Alaska.</i>

61
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:20,249
<i>Today's the last day...</i>

62
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:26,096
<i>I'm leaving too, getting
on that last plane out of here.</i>

63
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:50,049
Hey, Stella, are you okay?

64
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,454
Damn it, Malekai.

65
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,560
Don't you know what
"right of way" means?

66
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,129
I'm sorry, Stella.

67
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,361
The brakes jammed and...

68
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:05,867
Eben wanted this back from the airport
before the storm hit, and I was...

69
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:09,132
Oh, shit.
Who's gonna run me to the airport?

70
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:11,672
Well, wouldn't Eben?

71
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:15,573
My mom could come down
and give you a tow...

72
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:18,079
...but, you know,
she don't move too fast.

73
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:20,249
Fuck! Where's my phone?

74
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,136
It's me.

75
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,715
Surprise.

76
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,355
L... I need a ride to the airport.

77
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:00,415
What?

78
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:04,294
You're in town,
and you didn't wanna talk?

79
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:09,525
<i>I had fire-marshal work here,
and I just had a little accident.</i>

80
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:12,101
I'm stuck on Ransom and 355.
The airport'll close...

81
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:14,431
...and I'll never get to Anchorage.

82
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:22,005
I mean, if you wanna talk,
we can do it on the drive.

83
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:27,944
Hey, Billy.

84
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:30,122
Stella's stuck at Ransom and 355.

85
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:33,155
She needs a ride to the airport.
Can you go get her?

86
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:39,731
Yeah.

87
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,163
John Riis needs me
for something...

88
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,461
...so Billy's gonna come get you.

89
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:48,703
Let me know if a day comes
when you do wanna talk.

90
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:22,104
What sick jerk would do this?

91
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:26,039
Every kennel. Every dog we had.

92
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:29,013
Did you fight with anyone
recently, John?

93
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:36,318
I'll kill them. I'll kill them.

94
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:39,647
This wasn't done long ago.

95
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:45,419
I'll find them. Okay?

96
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:53,600
You'll be okay, Malekai.

97
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:02,275
- Where have you been?
- I couldn't find the damn car keys.

98
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:06,713
Then I was like, "Wait, was that
Rogers and 355 or Ransom?"

99
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:08,978
- And then...
- Yeah, never mind. Let's go.

100
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:15,950
It would be a lot easier
if you just played, Grandma.

101
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:20,496
Oh, I don't really care for those sort of
games, if you wanna know the truth.

102
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:23,500
Try your brother.

103
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:27,803
- What?
- Eben, do you wanna play?

104
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:31,505
I can't right now, Jake. Sorry.

105
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:35,045
While you were busy with John Riis,
Carter and Wilson called...

106
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:37,909
...about a vandalism problem
at the Utilidor.

107
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,586
Thanks.

108
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:48,660
Call Point Hope and Wainwright.
See if they're having any troubles.

109
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:05,232
No.

110
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:11,076
I am not trapped here for a month.

111
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:22,092
- There's someone you can bunk with.
- Don't start, Billy.

112
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:26,025
Peggy and me can put two girls in one
room. You'd have a place of your own.

113
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:29,724
I can't stay here. I've got bills
to put in the mail. My plants'll die.

114
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:31,998
It'll all work out.

115
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:35,434
Of course, the price
of staying at my place...

116
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:39,133
...is explaining to me and Peggy
just what is wrong with you and Eben.

117
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:48,353
Not enough time this century
to cover that, Billy.

118
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,880
Eben, how you doing?

119
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,571
- Good to see you.
- Hey, Carter.

120
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:19,614
Lord, it's gotta be
10 below out here.

121
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:21,979
- Eben.
- Wilson.

122
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:32,689
Can't your wife bring you up
a sweater or two?

123
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:35,690
Bring the whole tribe up
while she's at it?

124
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:38,936
They'll come when they're ready,
I guess.

125
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:40,830
So...

126
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,601
...I've found all kinds of garbage
in here over the years.

127
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:47,005
Blue jeans, bikes...

128
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:50,670
Sometimes I can yank them out before
the muffin monster chews them to shit.

129
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:52,783
The muffin monster?

130
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,718
I saw Wilson's helicopter logo.

131
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:05,294
Pulled that stuff out
before it got totally trashed.

132
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:12,770
You keep your copter
under lock and key, don't you?

133
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:16,601
Yeah, I put it in dry dock
when the tourists headed south.

134
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:19,935
I haven't looked at it for days.
They ripped out the throttle...

135
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,705
...the rotors,
half the fucking helicopter!

136
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:24,607
It's my life, Eben.

137
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:28,582
Why would someone
rip the hell out of my bird?

138
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:02,106
Hey! Stop!

139
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,713
Stop! Stop!

140
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:07,242
Who are you people?

141
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,266
No whiskey?

142
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:27,532
No rum?

143
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:29,434
Alcohol's illegal this month.

144
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:34,410
Folks have a hard enough time in the
dark without booze making it worse.

145
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:39,343
Well, forget about the liquor...

146
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:41,312
...Lucy.

147
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,115
Just bring me a bowl of...

148
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:47,155
...raw hamburger.

149
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:51,489
You can only get meat two ways
around here, frozen or burnt.

150
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:58,066
You don't bring me what I wanna eat,
what I wanna drink.

151
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,295
That's enough, pal.

152
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:02,606
Leave the lady be.

153
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:29,560
Hey, what do you say the two of us
go outside and have a little talk, huh?

154
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:36,733
Well, now, what's wrong with a man
wanting a little fresh meat?

155
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:41,846
Come on. You and me, let's go.

156
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,179
I'm taking you outside.

157
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:49,581
I would like to see that.

158
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:54,024
I would too.

159
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:58,762
But then Lucy'd have to clean up
after Eben kicked your ass.

160
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:05,159
It's more trouble than you're worth.

161
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,173
Hey, be nice!

162
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:17,247
Enough.

163
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:18,939
Stay down.

164
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:24,948
Fire marshal's office lets you carry
one of those things?

165
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:28,490
It's a funny thing, I never asked.

166
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:31,288
So you missed your flight?

167
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:34,431
That sucks. Where you gonna stay?

168
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:43,240
Billy and Peggy are putting me up.

169
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:49,940
Well, I'll talk to you sometime,
I guess.

170
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:54,649
Hey, listen.

171
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:59,917
Look, maybe I'll come along
and say hi to Jake and Helen.

172
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:05,596
Bye, Luce.

173
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:18,037
We haven't seen vandalism
like this in a long time.

174
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:22,038
Don't you know how to take care
of this town without me?

175
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,658
Malekai totaled my car.

176
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,428
Hell of a day.

177
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:39,687
Just you wait.

178
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:57,644
Hey, Jake.

179
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:07,258
- Where are we going?
- I'm heading back to your house.

180
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:08,448
My landlady...

181
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,356
...doesn't want pipeline workers
keeping her up all night.

182
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:13,155
Denise is right.

183
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:16,833
- Let's head back to my place.
- Neither of you are getting me alone.

184
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:18,593
Neither!

185
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:22,235
We share, right?
None of us have to be greedy.

186
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:26,070
- Yeah, come on. We'll be good.
- Oh, you will?

187
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:29,839
- Where's the fun in that, Gabe?
- You bad little bitch.

188
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:31,913
All right, all right,
Rock, Paper, Scissors.

189
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:35,515
- Whoever wins, we go to his place.
- Good idea. Let's do it.

190
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:37,586
- Come on.
- Hurry up, let's get moving.

191
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,018
On three.

192
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:42,192
One, two...

193
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:47,021
Gabe?

194
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:50,960
Gabe?

195
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:52,896
Gabe!

196
00:23:13,191 --> 00:23:15,352
Let me tell you what I got.

197
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:18,563
You don't work at the refinery.

198
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:23,025
You didn't fly in.
Somebody'd have seen you.

199
00:23:24,002 --> 00:23:26,698
And you're definitely
not from around here.

200
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,873
How'd you get in?

201
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:38,705
All right.

202
00:23:41,286 --> 00:23:45,416
We got a long time to figure this out.
Nobody's coming for you for a month.

203
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:06,176
Jake, come here a second.

204
00:24:13,518 --> 00:24:15,452
What the hell is that?

205
00:24:15,821 --> 00:24:19,848
It's pot. It helps her with her cancer.

206
00:24:20,058 --> 00:24:23,824
Didn't tell you I got a little greenhouse
at home. Didn't want you arresting me.

207
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:28,993
Now I know why you wanted
to live with Grandma.

208
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:31,965
No, I just thought you and Stella
ought to have some privacy.

209
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:34,035
Well, that worked out.

210
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,375
Computer's down.

211
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:42,408
I'll call Gus.

212
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:49,212
Strange.

213
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:52,657
The phone's down too.

214
00:24:52,858 --> 00:24:56,294
Mr. And Mrs. Sheriff.

215
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:59,522
So sweet.

216
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:01,493
So...

217
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:05,659
...helpless against what is coming.

218
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:09,972
He's just trying to freak us out.

219
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:12,168
It's working.

220
00:25:13,979 --> 00:25:16,413
We have more important things
to think about.

221
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:19,715
- I'll check on Gus.
- Check on Gus.

222
00:25:20,385 --> 00:25:22,376
Bar the windows.

223
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:24,384
Try to hide.

224
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,721
They're coming.

225
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:32,754
This time they gonna
take me with them, honor me.

226
00:25:33,598 --> 00:25:37,398
Yeah. For all that I have done.

227
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:39,994
"They"?

228
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:45,368
Who are "they"?

229
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:59,452
The generator's kicked in.

230
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,071
- I'm heading out to the cell tower.
- We have to stay here with him?

231
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:22,542
Sure. We'll keep an eye on him.

232
00:26:23,114 --> 00:26:25,810
As soon as the lines are back up,
get Billy over here.

233
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:28,850
Stay on the walkie-talkie with me
until the power's back.

234
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:51,665
Gus!

235
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,485
Gus?

236
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:39,686
This is Sheriff Eben Oleson.
Stay in your homes, lock your doors...

237
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:43,026
...and load your firearms.
This is not a drill.

238
00:27:44,529 --> 00:27:47,020
- Is your genny up and running?
- Yeah.

239
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:51,165
Anyone with a genny should go home
immediately, just to be safe.

240
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:53,803
If you don't have one,
you should meet at the diner.

241
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:56,803
I heard gunshots, Eben.
What the hell is going on?

242
00:27:57,108 --> 00:27:58,632
I don't know.

243
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:03,879
Just go home.
I'll let you know when I find out, okay?

244
00:28:04,082 --> 00:28:05,242
Okay.

245
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:10,587
Come on, guys. Let's go.

246
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:19,386
Let's just have dinner, John.

247
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:25,158
Please?

248
00:28:46,491 --> 00:28:48,823
John! John!

249
00:28:49,094 --> 00:28:50,288
- Ally!
- John!

250
00:28:51,096 --> 00:28:53,360
No! No! John!

251
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,035
John!

252
00:29:06,444 --> 00:29:08,378
John!

253
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,514
No!

254
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:14,609
John!

255
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:16,377
Ally! Ally!

256
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:20,054
- John! John!
- Ally!

257
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:21,418
- Oh, my God!
- Ally!

258
00:29:21,626 --> 00:29:24,356
- John! John!
- Ally!

259
00:29:24,562 --> 00:29:27,588
Oh, my God. No!

260
00:29:30,401 --> 00:29:32,494
No way out of town.

261
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:34,794
No one to come help.

262
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:37,031
- Shut up.
- Ignore him, Jake.

263
00:29:38,743 --> 00:29:40,301
You can feel it.

264
00:29:42,013 --> 00:29:47,110
That cold ain't the weather,
that's death approaching.

265
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:51,955
Who you think
they gonna take first?

266
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:58,624
The girl who thinks
a gun will help her?

267
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:02,091
The kid, sheriff's kid?
Or the old gal?

268
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:04,062
Shut up!

269
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:09,132
Yeah.

270
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:13,002
Thank you for the plastique.

271
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:17,409
I can snap that apart
and pick the lock.

272
00:30:17,615 --> 00:30:20,675
- No, you won't.
- Jake, he can't. Jake.

273
00:30:22,887 --> 00:30:24,081
Jake.

274
00:30:34,265 --> 00:30:35,994
You shithead.

275
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:39,064
Helen, get the first-aid kit.

276
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:55,013
All right, time to talk.
Who are you here with?

277
00:30:55,386 --> 00:30:56,819
Who are you here with?

278
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:02,722
Who did that to Gus?

279
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:07,227
You're a dead man.

280
00:31:07,665 --> 00:31:09,530
Where are they?!

281
00:31:10,602 --> 00:31:13,002
I don't talk to dead men.

282
00:31:13,838 --> 00:31:16,500
I don't talk to dead men!

283
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:21,771
Well, if I'm dead,
no one lets you loose from here.

284
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:24,238
You're all dead!

285
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:34,789
I can take care of that for now,
but Doc Miller...

286
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:38,690
No. Wait till the power's back.
Call Doc Miller then.

287
00:31:38,963 --> 00:31:41,523
This fucker doesn't deserve
anything till then.

288
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:53,100
Billy and I'll work our way
from South Street to the pipeline.

289
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,481
His friends don't have
many places to hide.

290
00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:01,115
I'll join you.

291
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,451
No, we got it.

292
00:32:05,823 --> 00:32:08,690
Right now, you, me and Billy
are the authorities.

293
00:32:08,893 --> 00:32:11,487
It'd be stupid not to take more help.

294
00:32:11,696 --> 00:32:14,529
We got walkie-talkies. We'll be fine.

295
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:20,671
There's a Taser in the back.
If he gives you any trouble...

296
00:32:20,872 --> 00:32:23,340
...use it. Okay?

297
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:26,039
You drive. I'm riding shotgun.

298
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:34,274
- Stop the truck.
- What?

299
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:35,846
Stop the fucking truck.

300
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,529
I thought I saw something.

301
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:05,214
- Get in the truck.
- What?

302
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:06,911
Get in the fucking truck!

303
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:21,923
- Jesus Christ!
- Fuck!

304
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:32,532
- Holy shit!
- Fuck!

305
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,247
What the hell was that?

306
00:34:02,573 --> 00:34:05,508
Shit! What was that?
Where was that? Where was that?

307
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:08,039
<i>No!</i>

308
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:09,506
<i>- Helen!
- Help!</i>

309
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:12,581
Helen! Helen, come in!

310
00:34:20,324 --> 00:34:21,382
Jake?

311
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:22,948
Helen?

312
00:34:24,862 --> 00:34:26,159
Are you here?

313
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,929
Oh, shit.

314
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:47,282
They didn't take me.

315
00:34:53,658 --> 00:34:55,592
Who did they take?

316
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:59,427
They didn't take me.

317
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:07,262
Did they take my brother?

318
00:35:20,351 --> 00:35:22,216
Finish me off.

319
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:29,092
Finish me.

320
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:33,796
Eben.

321
00:35:35,733 --> 00:35:37,667
Eben, look at me.

322
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,662
No.

323
00:35:58,189 --> 00:36:05,186
The heads must be separated
from the bodies.

324
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,696
Do not turn them.

325
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:18,069
We should have come here ages ago.

326
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:45,465
What are they?

327
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:50,368
We don't know.

328
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:54,409
- Wilson, I wanna go home.
- It's okay. Dad!

329
00:36:54,612 --> 00:36:57,740
- It's okay.
- You keep shooting and they just...

330
00:36:58,249 --> 00:36:59,648
They just keep coming.

331
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:02,751
- How is that possible?
- I don't know.

332
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:05,980
Maybe they're all coked up
on PCP or something, you know.

333
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:08,283
They don't feel any bullets.

334
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:17,667
They killed every sled dog in town.

335
00:37:21,038 --> 00:37:23,268
They took Aaron and Gabe.

336
00:37:23,507 --> 00:37:25,099
They killed my grandmother.

337
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:54,397
There is no escape.

338
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:58,174
No hope.

339
00:37:59,143 --> 00:38:01,771
Only hunger and pain.

340
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:08,577
What are you? What are you?

341
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:13,569
- Lucy, is the back door locked? Okay.
- All locked.

342
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:17,103
Jake?

343
00:40:18,816 --> 00:40:22,013
- Eben! Eben!
- Jake.

344
00:40:23,554 --> 00:40:26,955
- Who the hell are these people, Eben?
- What do they want?

345
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:35,428
We'll figure that out when we
get you guys someplace safe.

346
00:40:35,633 --> 00:40:38,864
There's a generator at the Utilidor.

347
00:40:39,069 --> 00:40:42,800
No, that's way out on the edge of town.
We need someplace close to hide.

348
00:40:43,007 --> 00:40:43,996
Now.

349
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:48,275
Charlie Kelso's attic.

350
00:40:49,046 --> 00:40:51,480
It has a pull-down ladder.
You can't tell it's there.

351
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:54,817
He would've boarded up
his home before he left.

352
00:40:55,419 --> 00:40:57,284
Which is exactly why
it's a good idea.

353
00:40:57,788 --> 00:41:00,951
We'll pull down a board to get in,
then we'll tack it back.

354
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:02,720
Carter.

355
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:09,588
I want you to lead everybody
close to the buildings.

356
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,961
If you hear anything,
roll under a crawlspace.

357
00:41:12,169 --> 00:41:15,730
Go straight to Kelso's attic.
I'll meet you there.

358
00:41:16,106 --> 00:41:17,903
What are you gonna do?

359
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:24,345
I'm gonna load up with as many bear
traps and flares as a 4x4 can carry.

360
00:41:24,882 --> 00:41:27,146
Something's gotta slow them down.

361
00:41:32,957 --> 00:41:34,322
I'm coming with you.

362
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:37,916
Okay.

363
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:04,749
- Fuck!
- Oh, shit!

364
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:06,245
Shit!

365
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:15,331
Fuck!

366
00:42:17,801 --> 00:42:19,132
Shit!

367
00:42:34,351 --> 00:42:36,080
Eben!

368
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:40,516
No!

369
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:47,057
Go! Get out of here!

370
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:50,590
Shit. Shit. Shit.

371
00:42:58,275 --> 00:42:59,765
Move it. Move it!

372
00:43:01,779 --> 00:43:03,269
Come on!

373
00:43:12,022 --> 00:43:13,387
Go!

374
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:21,991
- What the hell is going on?
- I don't know.

375
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:25,191
- We gotta lose this thing.
- And go where?

376
00:43:25,869 --> 00:43:27,700
We know a place.

377
00:43:44,421 --> 00:43:45,888
Okay.

378
00:43:57,501 --> 00:43:58,798
Go.

379
00:44:19,023 --> 00:44:20,991
These seem to work.

380
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:25,993
It's well hidden.

381
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:40,775
Hey.

382
00:44:47,651 --> 00:44:49,619
Two, three.

383
00:45:25,789 --> 00:45:27,689
I saw them...

384
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:31,923
...feed on Grandma Helen.

385
00:45:33,764 --> 00:45:37,097
They're like vampires, you know?

386
00:45:39,269 --> 00:45:41,169
Vampires don't exist, Jake.

387
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:44,264
They don't fall
when you shoot them.

388
00:45:45,142 --> 00:45:46,575
Hell, neither do I.

389
00:45:47,444 --> 00:45:51,073
Well, I don't care what they are.
I just care what we do about them.

390
00:45:52,216 --> 00:45:54,446
What are we gonna do about them?

391
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:00,614
We'll sleep in shifts.

392
00:46:02,326 --> 00:46:06,057
We'll ration our food, and then
we'll figure out the next step.

393
00:46:08,632 --> 00:46:12,295
We have two advantages.
We know this town...

394
00:46:13,036 --> 00:46:14,298
...and we know the cold.

395
00:46:15,539 --> 00:46:17,166
We live here for a reason.

396
00:46:19,309 --> 00:46:21,470
Because nobody else can.

397
00:46:29,253 --> 00:46:31,244
Yeah, right.

398
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:58,175
You did all that I asked.

399
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:10,551
We will take care of you.

400
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:39,084
The things they believe.

401
00:47:59,676 --> 00:48:02,372
I guess it's good
you didn't want kids, huh?

402
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:05,477
Imagine.

403
00:48:08,252 --> 00:48:10,550
Where...? Where's Catherine?
Where's Catherine?

404
00:48:10,754 --> 00:48:13,154
- Dad. Dad. Dad.
- What?

405
00:48:13,357 --> 00:48:16,656
Dad, Mom died a long time ago.

406
00:48:19,196 --> 00:48:20,390
Isaac...

407
00:48:20,597 --> 00:48:24,931
...you should go to sleep now.
You should go to sleep.

408
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:29,395
That's right. That's right.
You should go to sleep.

409
00:48:32,209 --> 00:48:33,904
Thank you.

410
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:54,420
They're ransacking
the Clarks' place.

411
00:48:55,299 --> 00:48:57,199
They're tearing through
everyone's home.

412
00:48:57,467 --> 00:49:00,903
- We have to move.
- When do you suggest we do that?

413
00:49:01,405 --> 00:49:04,306
Now, while we have the strength.

414
00:49:05,075 --> 00:49:08,306
Until we have some way to stop them,
it's suicide, Lucy.

415
00:49:08,512 --> 00:49:11,106
We can stay here
until they find us...

416
00:49:11,315 --> 00:49:13,306
...and they can kill us all,
or we can run.

417
00:49:13,517 --> 00:49:16,111
Some won't make it,
but it's better than all of us dying!

418
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,117
- Shut up!
- Doug, you should sit down.

419
00:49:18,355 --> 00:49:19,617
Maybe Denise or Lucy dies...

420
00:49:19,823 --> 00:49:22,121
...but that's okay so long as
you have a chance?

421
00:49:22,326 --> 00:49:24,351
- Hey. Hey.
- Hey.

422
00:49:32,436 --> 00:49:33,630
Stupid.

423
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:44,745
Start a fight, that'll get us all
killed a lot faster.

424
00:49:55,792 --> 00:49:56,850
Okay.

425
00:50:01,965 --> 00:50:05,662
We go to the general store to get
supplies, then we go to the Utilidor.

426
00:50:11,308 --> 00:50:13,674
But we'll never make it there
without cover.

427
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:18,641
We get there,
we can last the month.

428
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:21,840
The next blizzard, we'll be ready.

429
00:50:31,762 --> 00:50:33,662
Hello!

430
00:50:35,165 --> 00:50:37,133
Somebody!

431
00:50:43,106 --> 00:50:45,336
Help!

432
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:48,008
Come on.

433
00:50:49,946 --> 00:50:52,107
Help!

434
00:50:53,683 --> 00:50:55,810
Please!

435
00:50:56,953 --> 00:50:58,978
Anyone?

436
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:02,722
Hello?

437
00:51:05,429 --> 00:51:07,420
Anyone?

438
00:51:08,198 --> 00:51:10,166
Help!

439
00:51:13,703 --> 00:51:15,671
We need to get her in
before they find her.

440
00:51:15,872 --> 00:51:17,567
- Wait.
- What?

441
00:51:18,041 --> 00:51:20,669
Look at the rooftops behind her.

442
00:51:25,816 --> 00:51:28,284
Please!

443
00:51:32,222 --> 00:51:34,520
They're using her as bait.

444
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:04,653
Please.

445
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:08,356
Please, no. I tried.

446
00:52:08,558 --> 00:52:10,321
There isn't anybody left.

447
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:17,996
Please.

448
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:22,469
Please, God. Please.

449
00:52:23,673 --> 00:52:25,834
God?

450
00:52:42,726 --> 00:52:43,988
No God.

451
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:04,707
Eben.

452
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:14,982
Eben!

453
00:53:22,098 --> 00:53:23,531
<i>I'll come to you.</i>

454
00:54:06,009 --> 00:54:08,739
I've known Kirsten my whole life.

455
00:54:09,279 --> 00:54:10,268
I'm going out.

456
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,380
Why we waiting?
While they're feeding...

457
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:14,607
...we could make a run for it.

458
00:54:14,818 --> 00:54:17,309
- I can kill these things.
- We'll die in here otherwise.

459
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,283
Eben doesn't know what he's doing!

460
00:54:19,489 --> 00:54:20,456
- Just move.
- Beau.

461
00:54:20,657 --> 00:54:22,716
We agreed to keep
the bigger weapon here.

462
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:25,394
- Just move!
- We need you here.

463
00:54:35,872 --> 00:54:37,533
Okay.

464
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:39,765
Okay. Okay.

465
00:54:51,254 --> 00:54:52,778
John.

466
00:54:54,257 --> 00:54:56,384
How long have you
been under there?

467
00:54:57,427 --> 00:54:58,621
I'm not sure.

468
00:54:59,195 --> 00:55:00,685
Where's Ally?

469
00:55:01,865 --> 00:55:04,026
Took Ally.

470
00:55:04,234 --> 00:55:05,997
Couldn't follow.

471
00:55:07,203 --> 00:55:08,898
You're okay?

472
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:14,442
- The leg hurts.
- Okay.

473
00:55:15,612 --> 00:55:18,342
I know a safe place.

474
00:55:18,548 --> 00:55:22,314
I'm gonna pull you out.
But stay quiet.

475
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:26,079
Come on.

476
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:30,259
So hungry.

477
00:55:30,927 --> 00:55:33,691
Yeah, we'll get you
something to eat. Yeah.

478
00:55:40,637 --> 00:55:42,298
What happened to you?

479
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:44,739
Shit!

480
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:54,942
Eben.

481
00:55:56,152 --> 00:55:57,278
Come on.

482
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:03,454
John.

483
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,060
John! Stay back! Stay back!

484
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:18,634
John.

485
00:56:19,976 --> 00:56:21,341
Stay back!

486
00:57:18,168 --> 00:57:19,726
Are you hurt?

487
00:57:19,969 --> 00:57:22,028
- There's blood.
- He can't breathe.

488
00:57:22,238 --> 00:57:24,206
I'm okay. I'm okay.

489
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:26,341
Where's your inhaler?

490
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:30,543
- I lost it.
- Oh, shit.

491
00:57:37,554 --> 00:57:39,954
John Riis became one of them.

492
00:58:37,714 --> 00:58:39,011
Isaac.

493
00:58:43,653 --> 00:58:46,178
No. Isaac.

494
00:58:46,422 --> 00:58:48,686
I'm walking to Wainwright.

495
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:51,152
It's 80 miles.
There's no way to get there.

496
00:58:52,462 --> 00:58:54,657
- Just go back upstairs.
- Wilson.

497
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:58,027
Come on down. We need to get
out of here. Bring your mother too.

498
00:58:58,234 --> 00:59:00,759
- Okay, we'll die if you go out there.
- No!

499
00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:05,134
No. I'll die if I stay here. That's what's
gonna happen. Leave me alone.

500
00:59:06,676 --> 00:59:07,734
What's she doing?

501
00:59:08,311 --> 00:59:10,779
Just... Just keep quiet.

502
00:59:12,982 --> 00:59:15,348
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

503
00:59:19,188 --> 00:59:21,122
Let's just go back upstairs.

504
00:59:21,324 --> 00:59:23,622
Can l...? There's a bathroom?

505
00:59:24,327 --> 00:59:26,522
No... Okay, remember
you can't flush.

506
00:59:26,729 --> 00:59:29,061
We'll just open the valve afterwards.

507
00:59:50,553 --> 00:59:53,351
Who would have thought
we'd make it this long, huh?

508
00:59:53,556 --> 00:59:54,818
We're ahead of the curve.

509
00:59:55,024 --> 00:59:57,754
Every day they need more food.
They'll be back.

510
01:00:03,166 --> 01:00:05,691
Dad? Dad?

511
01:00:05,902 --> 01:00:07,369
Dad!

512
01:00:08,171 --> 01:00:09,536
No noise!

513
01:00:18,081 --> 01:00:20,447
- Wait! You can't just rush out.
- He's my father.

514
01:00:20,783 --> 01:00:22,114
Wait! No!

515
01:00:50,513 --> 01:00:52,947
Stella, are you all right?
What happened?

516
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:56,084
Isaac went to Wainwright.

517
01:00:56,953 --> 01:01:00,480
- Wilson went to find him.
- How long you been down here?

518
01:01:33,056 --> 01:01:34,921
Dad!

519
01:01:50,306 --> 01:01:51,864
Dad!

520
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:09,858
Dad!

521
01:02:13,496 --> 01:02:15,396
Dad!

522
01:02:53,236 --> 01:02:55,397
I should've fought harder.

523
01:02:57,740 --> 01:02:59,765
Kept Wilson here.

524
01:03:02,311 --> 01:03:05,678
It's hard to stop someone
when their family's at stake.

525
01:03:09,418 --> 01:03:11,579
The things you'll do
to save your own.

526
01:03:13,556 --> 01:03:15,786
We were like that once.

527
01:03:17,593 --> 01:03:19,288
Weren't we?

528
01:03:59,468 --> 01:04:01,129
It's gone.

529
01:04:03,606 --> 01:04:04,971
It's snowing.

530
01:04:05,775 --> 01:04:08,437
As soon as it's safe,
we have to move.

531
01:05:25,554 --> 01:05:27,454
You four, canned goods.

532
01:05:27,690 --> 01:05:30,591
Stella, Carter, propane, batteries.

533
01:05:30,793 --> 01:05:34,957
Jake, medical supplies. We meet
back here in two minutes. Let's go.

534
01:06:01,424 --> 01:06:04,723
I promised my wife I wouldn't live
on these things while she was gone.

535
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:06,292
She'll cut you slack.

536
01:06:31,887 --> 01:06:33,718
Oh, God.

537
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:40,251
I'm done playing with this one.

538
01:06:41,764 --> 01:06:43,789
You wanna play with me now?

539
01:06:45,401 --> 01:06:46,698
Come on!

540
01:06:52,074 --> 01:06:53,063
What?

541
01:06:55,244 --> 01:06:57,075
Okay.

542
01:06:57,947 --> 01:06:59,380
Wait.

543
01:07:55,771 --> 01:07:57,261
Somebody!

544
01:07:57,506 --> 01:07:59,235
Somebody get the ax!

545
01:08:16,792 --> 01:08:18,953
She was just a girl.

546
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:26,568
You did the right thing.

547
01:08:35,377 --> 01:08:36,674
It's okay.

548
01:08:49,225 --> 01:08:50,817
Who was she?

549
01:08:52,027 --> 01:08:54,291
I mean, does anybody
recognize her?

550
01:08:54,797 --> 01:08:56,230
No.

551
01:08:56,799 --> 01:08:57,857
No.

552
01:09:01,403 --> 01:09:03,166
The whiteout's over.

553
01:09:14,183 --> 01:09:16,413
We have to move.

554
01:09:16,619 --> 01:09:18,678
We can't stay here.

555
01:09:18,888 --> 01:09:21,322
But the Utilidor's too far
without cover.

556
01:09:26,795 --> 01:09:27,819
Eben?

557
01:09:28,397 --> 01:09:33,460
Could we make it to your station
if somebody created a diversion?

558
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:39,232
How?

559
01:09:42,711 --> 01:09:45,145
These things can't survive the sun.

560
01:09:45,915 --> 01:09:47,974
What if we brought the sun early?

561
01:09:50,152 --> 01:09:51,881
Helen had that operation at home.

562
01:09:52,254 --> 01:09:55,314
Yeah. She used an ultraviolet light
to grow the stuff.

563
01:09:55,524 --> 01:09:59,324
Yeah. I can run for her place,
let them follow me.

564
01:09:59,528 --> 01:10:03,089
Hit them with the sun lamp while the
rest of you go to the sheriff's station.

565
01:10:03,299 --> 01:10:05,324
Just because something
stopped Bela Lugosi...

566
01:10:05,534 --> 01:10:08,230
...doesn't mean it can stop
these things.

567
01:10:08,437 --> 01:10:11,600
Why would they send that stranger
to cut us off...

568
01:10:11,807 --> 01:10:14,002
...if they can handle the light?

569
01:10:14,610 --> 01:10:16,510
What if it doesn't work?

570
01:10:20,583 --> 01:10:22,312
It has to.

571
01:10:28,757 --> 01:10:30,349
I'll do it.

572
01:10:31,527 --> 01:10:33,461
- I'm the fastest.
- Bullshit.

573
01:10:34,496 --> 01:10:36,726
I weigh less than you
and I know Grandma's house.

574
01:10:36,932 --> 01:10:40,493
- You're 15 years old. Forget about it.
- I'm 15. Right.

575
01:10:40,703 --> 01:10:43,365
- You've got a wife. People need you.
- Jake.

576
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:46,367
I saw you in the back with the ax.

577
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:50,708
You think you're up to doing that
three or four more times?

578
01:10:51,847 --> 01:10:54,281
You don't even think
this plan'll work.

579
01:10:54,516 --> 01:10:56,211
Yeah, but you do.

580
01:10:58,187 --> 01:10:59,484
I'm going.

581
01:11:00,122 --> 01:11:02,022
I'll see you at the station.

582
01:11:02,491 --> 01:11:05,016
You'll need to start her genny first.

583
01:11:07,129 --> 01:11:08,460
See you soon.

584
01:11:17,473 --> 01:11:19,464
Hey!

585
01:11:35,057 --> 01:11:37,252
- Come on.
- Go, go, go.

586
01:11:42,197 --> 01:11:43,596
Hey!

587
01:11:44,333 --> 01:11:46,563
Come on, motherfuckers!

588
01:11:49,605 --> 01:11:50,663
Hey!

589
01:12:19,401 --> 01:12:21,835
Come on. Come on.

590
01:12:52,768 --> 01:12:54,065
Come on!

591
01:13:13,422 --> 01:13:15,219
Let me check.

592
01:13:19,928 --> 01:13:22,055
Okay, quick. Come in.

593
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:26,425
Come on, Stella.

594
01:14:37,739 --> 01:14:39,366
<i>You there?</i>

595
01:14:41,410 --> 01:14:44,846
Yeah. Yeah, it worked.

596
01:14:45,380 --> 01:14:47,940
But they're gonna cut off
the power, so...

597
01:15:21,650 --> 01:15:24,949
<i>Stella. I got out.</i>

598
01:15:25,754 --> 01:15:28,222
It's good to hear your voice.

599
01:15:28,423 --> 01:15:30,084
<i>Don't wait for me.</i>

600
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:33,828
Please.

601
01:15:37,099 --> 01:15:38,589
Eben.

602
01:15:40,202 --> 01:15:44,696
Run for Rogers Avenue,
towards the trencher.

603
01:15:49,645 --> 01:15:51,442
It's my turn.

604
01:16:19,741 --> 01:16:21,436
You do understand?

605
01:16:23,779 --> 01:16:29,046
What can be broken must be broken.

606
01:16:51,306 --> 01:16:52,330
Fuck off!

607
01:17:39,821 --> 01:17:42,813
Welcome to Barrow,
top of the world.

608
01:18:34,476 --> 01:18:36,740
You ain't gonna eat me.

609
01:19:16,084 --> 01:19:18,814
When a man meets a force...

610
01:19:19,454 --> 01:19:21,718
...he can't destroy...

611
01:19:23,125 --> 01:19:26,526
...he destroys himself instead.

612
01:19:29,097 --> 01:19:31,531
What a plague you are.

613
01:19:57,859 --> 01:19:59,121
Beau...

614
01:20:01,096 --> 01:20:02,893
And Doug.

615
01:20:31,626 --> 01:20:33,787
Now there's six of us.

616
01:20:36,298 --> 01:20:38,357
Soon there'll be just five.

617
01:20:46,441 --> 01:20:49,672
The little girl in the store.

618
01:20:50,679 --> 01:20:52,647
I changed.

619
01:20:54,049 --> 01:20:55,641
I'm just so thirsty now.

620
01:21:01,723 --> 01:21:03,884
I couldn't tell you.

621
01:21:04,492 --> 01:21:08,690
That photo's all I've got left
of my family.

622
01:21:12,367 --> 01:21:15,632
Martha was taking the kids
to visit her mom.

623
01:21:17,739 --> 01:21:19,570
They were hit...

624
01:21:21,176 --> 01:21:23,303
...by a drunk driver.

625
01:21:28,016 --> 01:21:31,679
I wanted to be with them so much.

626
01:21:35,991 --> 01:21:39,427
I couldn't bring myself to do it.

627
01:21:43,298 --> 01:21:46,597
But I know they're waiting for me.

628
01:21:50,705 --> 01:21:54,698
I can't live forever.

629
01:21:55,443 --> 01:21:57,274
I can't.

630
01:21:59,748 --> 01:22:00,737
Eben.

631
01:22:03,752 --> 01:22:05,549
Don't let me.

632
01:22:08,924 --> 01:22:10,721
No, Carter.

633
01:22:11,626 --> 01:22:13,719
He told us what he wants.

634
01:23:38,246 --> 01:23:39,975
Did you see that?

635
01:23:40,515 --> 01:23:41,982
Yeah.

636
01:23:49,791 --> 01:23:51,315
It's Billy.

637
01:24:18,486 --> 01:24:19,953
Billy.

638
01:24:50,351 --> 01:24:52,251
It's Peggy and the girls.

639
01:24:54,889 --> 01:24:57,289
I heard the screams.

640
01:24:58,927 --> 01:25:01,691
I didn't want them to die
like the rest.

641
01:25:03,932 --> 01:25:06,457
I tried to shoot myself too.

642
01:25:06,668 --> 01:25:09,193
The fucking gun jammed.

643
01:25:15,210 --> 01:25:17,075
I shouldn't have signaled to you.

644
01:25:18,947 --> 01:25:21,142
I just couldn't stand
being on my own.

645
01:25:40,935 --> 01:25:42,630
You have a family.

646
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:47,438
You don't ever hurt them!

647
01:25:48,776 --> 01:25:51,904
Don't ever hurt them.

648
01:26:10,965 --> 01:26:13,195
Maybe they tried for the Utilidor.

649
01:27:01,983 --> 01:27:03,280
Gail.

650
01:27:04,586 --> 01:27:05,951
Gail.

651
01:27:09,791 --> 01:27:11,019
No. Stella.

652
01:27:16,631 --> 01:27:17,962
Stella.

653
01:27:25,707 --> 01:27:27,299
I'll meet you at the Utilidor.

654
01:27:35,016 --> 01:27:37,109
No, Billy, stay there!

655
01:29:15,116 --> 01:29:16,481
Eben!

656
01:29:17,618 --> 01:29:18,949
Jake.

657
01:29:21,489 --> 01:29:22,786
Jake.

658
01:29:29,864 --> 01:29:31,058
Stella?

659
01:29:32,767 --> 01:29:34,667
Gail Robbins?

660
01:29:35,203 --> 01:29:36,534
We don't know.

661
01:29:50,184 --> 01:29:54,621
It took centuries for us...

662
01:29:54,989 --> 01:29:56,786
...to make them believe...

663
01:29:59,894 --> 01:30:05,526
...we were only bad dreams.

664
01:30:09,737 --> 01:30:16,404
We cannot give them reason
to suspect.

665
01:30:17,578 --> 01:30:19,478
Destroy them all.

666
01:31:18,172 --> 01:31:20,640
Stella, this is Eben. Come in.

667
01:31:22,376 --> 01:31:24,037
Where are you?

668
01:31:29,550 --> 01:31:31,279
Hello?

669
01:31:36,991 --> 01:31:40,154
- Hello?
- Stella. This is Eben.

670
01:31:40,361 --> 01:31:42,829
- Come in.
- Anyone?

671
01:32:08,523 --> 01:32:09,717
Eben!

672
01:32:42,290 --> 01:32:44,520
Billy. Bill, hey. Billy!

673
01:32:46,227 --> 01:32:48,320
- Go!
- No. Billy.

674
01:32:48,863 --> 01:32:49,921
Shit. Shit.

675
01:32:57,338 --> 01:32:58,327
Eben!

676
01:33:52,159 --> 01:33:53,490
Hey.

677
01:33:54,929 --> 01:33:57,261
I found these behind Carter's desk.

678
01:33:57,465 --> 01:34:00,559
Chocolates, vitamins and vodka.

679
01:34:03,070 --> 01:34:04,628
Stella, come in. This is Eben.

680
01:34:06,173 --> 01:34:07,936
We should celebrate.

681
01:34:09,810 --> 01:34:11,937
One day till sunrise.

682
01:34:22,890 --> 01:34:25,484
You did good
getting everybody here.

683
01:34:34,035 --> 01:34:35,525
<i>Eben.</i>

684
01:34:39,006 --> 01:34:40,769
Stella.

685
01:34:41,108 --> 01:34:44,771
<i>Whisper. They're walking around.</i>

686
01:34:45,012 --> 01:34:48,971
<i>I just had to hear your voice.
I've got Gail with me.</i>

687
01:34:49,183 --> 01:34:50,582
Where are you?

688
01:34:50,785 --> 01:34:53,618
Opposite the Melanson's,
under a wreck.

689
01:35:04,799 --> 01:35:08,428
- Are you okay?
- It's so cold.

690
01:35:08,969 --> 01:35:10,630
We're freezing, Eben.

691
01:35:11,605 --> 01:35:14,972
I can see the car.
The wreck on the right.

692
01:35:16,544 --> 01:35:18,375
We're coming to get you.

693
01:35:21,916 --> 01:35:24,009
There's way too many of them.

694
01:35:24,218 --> 01:35:26,743
They'd kill us before we got to her.

695
01:35:36,163 --> 01:35:38,688
We have to cut off
or they'll hear you.

696
01:35:40,134 --> 01:35:42,728
I'll call you back when it's safe.

697
01:35:46,173 --> 01:35:48,767
<i>The sun comes up tomorrow.</i>

698
01:35:50,211 --> 01:35:52,543
<i>We're gonna watch it together.</i>

699
01:35:54,815 --> 01:35:56,612
I'm so sorry, baby.

700
01:35:58,552 --> 01:36:01,146
<i>I should never have left you.</i>

701
01:36:05,226 --> 01:36:07,888
The street's filling up with oil.

702
01:36:15,002 --> 01:36:17,300
They broke into the pipeline.

703
01:36:47,067 --> 01:36:49,228
They're burning down the town.

704
01:37:05,352 --> 01:37:07,718
Nobody will know what happened.

705
01:37:09,423 --> 01:37:11,983
They'll just think it was
some horrible accident.

706
01:37:18,365 --> 01:37:21,732
Next time they'll take out
Point Hope, Wainwright.

707
01:37:27,308 --> 01:37:29,208
Wait. Wait.

708
01:37:29,743 --> 01:37:33,008
This building's strong.
Can't we just ride it out here?

709
01:37:43,891 --> 01:37:45,882
He'll kill her if she runs.

710
01:37:48,896 --> 01:37:50,386
She'll burn if she stays.

711
01:37:55,636 --> 01:37:58,400
You go out there,
won't they come after all of us?

712
01:38:11,986 --> 01:38:13,248
Oh, dear God.

713
01:38:13,854 --> 01:38:15,446
Eben.

714
01:38:21,962 --> 01:38:23,486
Eben!

715
01:38:28,235 --> 01:38:29,566
Eben.

716
01:38:31,105 --> 01:38:32,697
Jake...

717
01:38:32,907 --> 01:38:36,138
...when they're all watching me,
get on the walkie-talkie...

718
01:38:38,245 --> 01:38:42,579
...and tell Stella to run for it.
- What are you talking about?

719
01:38:48,088 --> 01:38:49,680
Eben.

720
01:38:50,658 --> 01:38:55,186
When John Riis and Carter changed,
they were only bitten.

721
01:38:55,396 --> 01:38:57,864
They stayed who they were
for a little while.

722
01:39:00,901 --> 01:39:03,267
We can't fight them
the way that we are.

723
01:39:08,008 --> 01:39:10,033
Thanks, little brother.

724
01:39:12,513 --> 01:39:14,481
Take care of Stella for me.

725
01:39:20,854 --> 01:39:23,982
- Are you fucking crazy?
- It's somebody else's blood.

726
01:39:45,980 --> 01:39:50,644
- He's one of them.
- How do we know he won't attack us?

727
01:39:51,218 --> 01:39:54,312
- Maybe we should stop him now.
- Shut up.

728
01:39:54,521 --> 01:39:55,852
Shut up!

729
01:39:58,492 --> 01:40:00,460
Nobody touches him.

730
01:40:06,333 --> 01:40:08,096
I can smell your blood.

731
01:40:28,722 --> 01:40:31,282
You can't fight them all, Eben.

732
01:41:15,969 --> 01:41:17,800
Stella, it's Jake.

733
01:41:18,972 --> 01:41:20,963
Get out of there now. Run.

734
01:41:27,681 --> 01:41:29,308
The one who fights.

735
01:42:23,637 --> 01:42:25,127
Go!

736
01:44:29,896 --> 01:44:32,330
What did you do to yourself?

737
01:44:33,634 --> 01:44:35,659
What I had to.

738
01:44:39,373 --> 01:44:40,806
Should I go after them?

739
01:44:47,447 --> 01:44:52,043
- It's almost dawn. We made it.
- Eben.

740
01:44:52,586 --> 01:44:54,315
The dawn.
