1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:02:24,062 --> 00:02:25,772
What?

3
00:02:26,773 --> 00:02:28,023
Hey.

4
00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:56,549
Hey. Hey! Hey, you okay?

5
00:02:58,012 --> 00:03:00,012
Hey! Hey! Hey!

6
00:03:01,724 --> 00:03:03,184
Please.

7
00:03:03,268 --> 00:03:05,768
Please don't be dead. You okay?

8
00:03:05,854 --> 00:03:08,234
Hello. Hey. Hey.

9
00:03:08,314 --> 00:03:09,569
Hey, you okay?

10
00:03:09,649 --> 00:03:12,939
Hello? Hello? Hello?

11
00:03:13,027 --> 00:03:16,027
Please don't be dead. Come on.

12
00:03:17,031 --> 00:03:19,621
Oh. Uh...

13
00:03:19,701 --> 00:03:22,201
And two. Breathe.

14
00:03:27,417 --> 00:03:28,747
Holy shit.

15
00:03:49,272 --> 00:03:51,732
Heh. That was funny.

16
00:03:52,734 --> 00:03:55,034
Heh. That was really funny.

17
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:00,280
You know, I...

18
00:04:00,366 --> 00:04:03,656
I had always hoped
that right before I die...

19
00:04:05,413 --> 00:04:10,253
...my life would flash before my eyes
and I would see wonderful things...

20
00:04:12,837 --> 00:04:18,337
A life full of parties and friends and...

21
00:04:18,426 --> 00:04:21,386
and how I'd learned to play the guitar,

22
00:04:21,471 --> 00:04:26,561
and... and maybe there'd even be a girl.

23
00:04:26,643 --> 00:04:28,983
But as I was hanging up there...

24
00:04:30,647 --> 00:04:33,437
...I didn't really see much of anything.

25
00:04:36,069 --> 00:04:37,859
But I did see you.

26
00:04:39,072 --> 00:04:41,742
And I know...
I know it sounds dumb, but I...

27
00:04:41,824 --> 00:04:43,954
I really thought for a moment that...

28
00:04:44,035 --> 00:04:47,035
that maybe, just maybe there was
a reason that you...

29
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,700
# Wah wah wah, wah wah wah #

30
00:06:51,788 --> 00:06:53,458
# Wah wah wah, wah wah wah #

31
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:57,419
# Ay ay ay, ay ay #

32
00:06:57,502 --> 00:07:00,132
- # Wah wah wah, wah wah wah #
- # Ay ay ay, ay ay #

33
00:07:14,685 --> 00:07:16,685
# Bra-da, bra-da #

34
00:07:16,771 --> 00:07:18,061
# Bra-da #

35
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,870
Wait! Wait! Wait!

36
00:07:29,951 --> 00:07:32,201
Wait! Wait for me! Wait for me!

37
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:37,498
Go! Go! Go!

38
00:09:19,143 --> 00:09:20,813
Cheese puffs?

39
00:09:52,218 --> 00:09:54,428
Hello, world!

40
00:10:06,023 --> 00:10:08,613
My name is Hank Thompson,

41
00:10:08,693 --> 00:10:14,743
and I've been stranded out on an island
in the Pacific all alone!

42
00:10:14,824 --> 00:10:16,494
And this man,

43
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:20,747
this man saved me from the brink of death

44
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:24,420
when he allowed me
to ride him like a jet ski,

45
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,290
propelled by his f...

46
00:10:39,682 --> 00:10:41,892
How did you do that?

47
00:10:43,227 --> 00:10:45,347
Maybe... Maybe your...

48
00:10:45,438 --> 00:10:48,148
your gases built up from decomposition

49
00:10:48,232 --> 00:10:53,152
and maybe your soul leaving you?

50
00:10:53,237 --> 00:10:55,487
Why am I talking to you?

51
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:09,211
Please work.

52
00:11:34,487 --> 00:11:36,277
Hello, world.

53
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,833
I'm sorry.

54
00:11:51,295 --> 00:11:52,835
I gotta go.

55
00:12:19,907 --> 00:12:21,577
Hello!

56
00:12:24,495 --> 00:12:25,745
Hello.

57
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:27,620
Help!

58
00:12:54,984 --> 00:12:58,824
Oh. You see that?

59
00:12:58,904 --> 00:13:01,160
There's gonna be people there.

60
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,160
They're gonna feed us and take care of us.

61
00:13:04,243 --> 00:13:06,290
Everybody's gonna want to hear our story,

62
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:09,210
and I'm gonna be all buff
from carrying you around.

63
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:14,090
Ohh. That's not funny.

64
00:13:15,504 --> 00:13:17,014
Hello?

65
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:20,546
Help.

66
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,970
Help!

67
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:20,239
# Oh, where did you come from,
where did you go? #

68
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:22,859
# Where did you come from,
Cotton Eye Joe? #

69
00:14:22,947 --> 00:14:25,067
Man, it's always the song that you hate

70
00:14:25,157 --> 00:14:27,577
that gets stuck in your head.

71
00:14:32,331 --> 00:14:34,541
Uh, sorry.

72
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:10,408
You can't sleep either?

73
00:15:48,157 --> 00:15:52,407
My mom used to sing this song to me
when I couldn't sleep

74
00:15:52,494 --> 00:15:56,964
so I wouldn't overthink things,
but I don't remember the words.

75
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:05,803
# Crazy #

76
00:16:05,883 --> 00:16:11,809
# I'm fucking crazy #

77
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:16,979
# Maybe, just maybe #

78
00:16:17,061 --> 00:16:23,531
# I'll make it alone #

79
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:51,097
# Rescued #

80
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:56,558
# I thought I was rescued #

81
00:16:56,642 --> 00:17:02,482
# But you're just a dead dude #

82
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:09,364
# And I'm gonna die #

83
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:11,736
# There's gotta be a better way #

84
00:17:11,824 --> 00:17:16,794
# To get out of here #

85
00:17:25,129 --> 00:17:30,429
# Where do you come from #

86
00:17:30,509 --> 00:17:34,009
# Cotton Eye Joe? #

87
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,030
Let me eat you.

88
00:17:57,244 --> 00:17:58,794
Ahh!

89
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:18,429
Huh? Come on!

90
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:21,345
Somebody help!

91
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:28,278
You're... you're just laying there
like a disgusting, useless sack of shit.

92
00:18:28,358 --> 00:18:31,198
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I have to go.

93
00:18:33,197 --> 00:18:36,657
Thanks for your help, kind of.

94
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:46,131
Why?

95
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:52,091
No. No, no, no. No.

96
00:18:52,174 --> 00:18:53,594
No, you asshole. Stop it.

97
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,349
Ohh! Ahh!

98
00:19:00,349 --> 00:19:02,349
Water! Water!

99
00:19:02,434 --> 00:19:04,064
What are you doing? What are you doing?

100
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:05,564
What are you doing?

101
00:19:44,101 --> 00:19:45,731
Okay.

102
00:19:55,487 --> 00:19:58,447
Ah, you're the grossest thing
in this gross world.

103
00:20:02,744 --> 00:20:05,084
Wait. No.

104
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:06,785
No, please. Please.

105
00:20:06,874 --> 00:20:09,254
Please, I'm sorry. Please don't stop.

106
00:20:12,838 --> 00:20:14,878
What?

107
00:20:14,965 --> 00:20:16,835
Mah... ehh.

108
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:24,561
Mahn... ehh.

109
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:27,604
Manny?

110
00:20:27,686 --> 00:20:29,476
Is that your name?

111
00:20:30,772 --> 00:20:33,612
Mahn... ehh.

112
00:20:33,692 --> 00:20:37,492
Hi, Manny. I'm Hank. Um...

113
00:20:39,865 --> 00:20:43,235
Hhh... nk.

114
00:20:43,327 --> 00:20:46,407
Hiiii.

115
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:48,536
Hi.

116
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,500
Huh... luh.

117
00:20:51,585 --> 00:20:53,495
Hello.

118
00:20:53,587 --> 00:20:55,707
- Hello...
- Hel... lo...

119
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:57,417
- Hank.
- Hank.

120
00:20:57,507 --> 00:20:59,257
That's very good.

121
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:06,221
I...

122
00:21:06,308 --> 00:21:09,808
Come on. Talk to me, buddy.

123
00:21:11,939 --> 00:21:14,109
Stop mumbling, please.

124
00:21:14,191 --> 00:21:17,281
Talk to me. Please. Speak up, Manny.

125
00:21:17,361 --> 00:21:20,861
How do you expect anyone to want to talk
to you if you sound retarded?

126
00:21:23,784 --> 00:21:26,164
I sound like my dad.

127
00:21:28,163 --> 00:21:30,213
I'm sorry.

128
00:21:31,667 --> 00:21:34,207
Hey. I didn't mean that.

129
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:36,049
Hey, you talk however you want.

130
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:39,049
You can mumble, look at your feet
all day long.

131
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:40,472
Okay, buddy?

132
00:21:43,053 --> 00:21:44,641
Okay, buddy.

133
00:21:59,403 --> 00:22:01,533
Hi.

134
00:22:01,613 --> 00:22:04,743
Hello.

135
00:22:04,825 --> 00:22:08,615
Why did you hit me? Hey.

136
00:22:08,704 --> 00:22:11,374
Why did you hit me?

137
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:15,503
I'm sorry. I...

138
00:22:15,585 --> 00:22:18,125
I thought you were dead.

139
00:22:18,213 --> 00:22:20,383
Am I dead?

140
00:22:20,465 --> 00:22:22,545
I don't think so. You're talking.

141
00:22:22,634 --> 00:22:25,349
But I sound retarded.

142
00:22:25,429 --> 00:22:27,219
No, no, you sound great.

143
00:22:27,347 --> 00:22:29,177
Don't say that word. I didn't...

144
00:22:29,266 --> 00:22:33,096
I'm a useless...

145
00:22:33,186 --> 00:22:35,556
- sack of shit?
- No, man.

146
00:22:35,647 --> 00:22:37,147
Hey.

147
00:22:37,232 --> 00:22:40,112
No. No, I didn't mean that.

148
00:22:40,193 --> 00:22:41,782
I was being an asshole.

149
00:22:41,862 --> 00:22:44,282
I'm not a sack of shit?

150
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:45,953
No, you're amazing.

151
00:22:46,033 --> 00:22:48,953
You're... You're a miracle, or...

152
00:22:49,036 --> 00:22:51,616
or I'm just hallucinating from starvation.

153
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,500
Uh-oh.

154
00:23:00,005 --> 00:23:03,125
This is... This is crazy.

155
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:05,546
# Crazy #

156
00:23:05,635 --> 00:23:07,795
- No, no, no, no, no.
- # I'm fucking crazy #

157
00:23:07,888 --> 00:23:10,218
Hey, hey, hey. Stop. Stop. Stop.
Stop. Stop singing.

158
00:23:10,307 --> 00:23:12,057
You weren't supposed to hear that.

159
00:23:12,142 --> 00:23:14,898
Oh, I like that. Singing.

160
00:23:14,978 --> 00:23:20,568
Okay, can you remember
anything about before, your life?

161
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:23,280
How you got here? Where we are?

162
00:23:23,403 --> 00:23:25,533
How you saved me?

163
00:23:25,614 --> 00:23:27,869
- Anything?
- Hey, what is that?

164
00:23:27,949 --> 00:23:29,788
Oh, that, no. I...

165
00:23:29,868 --> 00:23:32,288
Don't worry... Don't worry about that.

166
00:23:32,412 --> 00:23:36,002
What's important is that
we find a way to get home.

167
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:40,003
Okay. I'm trying to remember.

168
00:23:41,004 --> 00:23:42,764
What is home?

169
00:23:46,927 --> 00:23:50,597
This is from home.

170
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,890
It's normally full of these things
called cheese puffs.

171
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:55,851
Okay.

172
00:23:55,936 --> 00:24:01,606
Um, sometimes, um, your fingers
would be coated in orange after eating it.

173
00:24:01,691 --> 00:24:04,740
And your mom probably
told you to wash your hands,

174
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:07,910
but I bet you'd just lick it off
when she wasn't looking.

175
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:14,958
- Anything?
- What?

176
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:16,288
What?

177
00:24:16,373 --> 00:24:19,293
Wait. Wait, what's supposed to happen?

178
00:24:19,376 --> 00:24:21,336
I don't know. I thought...

179
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:24,421
thought maybe I could tap
into some sense memory or something,

180
00:24:24,506 --> 00:24:27,426
and, bam, the... the hairs would stand up
on the back of your neck,

181
00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:30,057
and your heart would start pounding
as it all rushes back to you,

182
00:24:30,137 --> 00:24:32,557
everything you left behind.
Your jaw hangs open.

183
00:24:32,639 --> 00:24:34,099
The camera pushes in.

184
00:24:34,182 --> 00:24:36,392
Cue the music.

185
00:24:47,154 --> 00:24:49,451
- You remember "Jurassic Park"!
- What?

186
00:24:49,531 --> 00:24:52,201
You were just singing the theme song.

187
00:24:52,284 --> 00:24:54,584
Laura Dern, the brachiosaurus.

188
00:24:56,121 --> 00:24:59,211
I don't know "Jurassic Park."

189
00:24:59,291 --> 00:25:01,671
You remember the song.

190
00:25:04,212 --> 00:25:06,259
Manny...

191
00:25:06,339 --> 00:25:11,429
if you don't know "Jurassic Park,"
you don't know shit.

192
00:25:11,511 --> 00:25:15,769
This is from home,
where all the other people are.

193
00:25:15,849 --> 00:25:18,559
- Why is it out here now?
- Oh, it's trash.

194
00:25:18,643 --> 00:25:21,191
It's everything people don't want,
so we hide it.

195
00:25:21,271 --> 00:25:24,191
Why don't people want it anymore?

196
00:25:24,274 --> 00:25:26,694
Well, that's broken.

197
00:25:26,776 --> 00:25:28,236
That's empty.

198
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,860
This is useless.

199
00:25:29,946 --> 00:25:31,656
Smelly. Old.

200
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:34,950
How'd you get so far from home?

201
00:25:35,035 --> 00:25:38,535
I... I ran away, but that's...

202
00:25:38,622 --> 00:25:40,001
It doesn't matter. That's...

203
00:25:40,081 --> 00:25:44,751
What's important is you
remembering your life.

204
00:25:44,836 --> 00:25:48,126
Okay. What is life?

205
00:25:48,215 --> 00:25:49,925
Uh, okay.

206
00:25:50,008 --> 00:25:51,838
This is you.

207
00:25:51,927 --> 00:25:55,635
This is your body, and...
and that's where your brain is,

208
00:25:55,722 --> 00:25:57,932
and that's where you're going
to remember something.

209
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:01,436
Humans have evolved over millions
and millions of years to be this way.

210
00:26:01,561 --> 00:26:03,271
- Yeah!
- We do all this stuff,

211
00:26:03,355 --> 00:26:06,855
because it helps us survive... kind of.

212
00:26:06,942 --> 00:26:08,192
What's that?

213
00:26:08,276 --> 00:26:11,236
That's poop.

214
00:26:11,321 --> 00:26:15,491
Poop is when your body
takes everything it doesn't want

215
00:26:15,575 --> 00:26:17,285
and squeezes it out of your butt.

216
00:26:17,369 --> 00:26:19,159
Everything poops. There's a book.

217
00:26:19,246 --> 00:26:20,792
Everybody reads about it
when they're a kid.

218
00:26:20,872 --> 00:26:23,252
People poop every day.

219
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:26,423
Or extra when they're scared or sick

220
00:26:26,503 --> 00:26:30,260
or right when they die, because, uh,
you shit your pants when you die.

221
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,090
- Oh, God.
- No, it's okay.

222
00:26:32,175 --> 00:26:34,045
People die every day.

223
00:26:36,763 --> 00:26:38,560
What do they do with all the dead people?

224
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,060
- Do they hide them?
- Yeah.

225
00:26:41,142 --> 00:26:44,522
- So I'm like trash?
- No. You're different.

226
00:26:44,604 --> 00:26:46,274
Maybe you fell in radioactive waste,

227
00:26:46,356 --> 00:26:49,476
or maybe you were a special genetically
engineered soldier

228
00:26:49,609 --> 00:26:51,990
who was cryogenically frozen
and sent back in time to save me

229
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:53,820
and save all of mankind.

230
00:26:54,823 --> 00:26:56,993
Oh, Super Manny, save me!

231
00:26:57,075 --> 00:26:58,785
You've got something in there.

232
00:26:58,868 --> 00:27:02,158
You're like the multipurpose tool guy.

233
00:27:02,247 --> 00:27:05,247
- You're special.
- I'm special?

234
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:09,132
Yeah. And that's why I need you
to help me get home.

235
00:27:09,212 --> 00:27:13,382
Back in civilization, there's 7 billion
other living people on the planet

236
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:17,716
just running around and blinking
and breathing and eating,

237
00:27:17,804 --> 00:27:19,514
and you used to be one of them.

238
00:27:19,639 --> 00:27:22,020
You were probably just looking for happiness.
That's what everyone does.

239
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,563
This is what you look like
when you're happy.

240
00:27:23,643 --> 00:27:24,981
Happy.

241
00:27:25,061 --> 00:27:29,106
You look for someone who will make you
happy, a friend, a girlfriend, or a dog.

242
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:31,320
- Ruff ruff. Good boy.
- Good boy.

243
00:27:31,401 --> 00:27:35,158
Sometimes you might be lucky enough
to bump into the one person

244
00:27:35,238 --> 00:27:36,948
you wanna spend the rest
of your life with,

245
00:27:37,032 --> 00:27:39,579
- and that is love.
- Okay.

246
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:42,869
You want to go home so you can have love?

247
00:27:42,954 --> 00:27:44,251
Yeah.

248
00:27:44,331 --> 00:27:46,920
But you ran away 'cause nobody loves you?

249
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,089
That's not true.

250
00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:54,005
You're broken and empty and dirty
and smelly and useless and old.

251
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:56,840
- You're like trash, right?
- Shut up. What...

252
00:27:56,926 --> 00:27:59,716
I'm sorry, Hank.
I'm just saying the things in my head.

253
00:27:59,804 --> 00:28:02,394
Well, you can't just say
everything that comes into your head.

254
00:28:02,474 --> 00:28:04,434
That's bad talking.

255
00:28:04,517 --> 00:28:07,057
Oh. I'm sorry.

256
00:28:11,775 --> 00:28:13,815
Help!

257
00:28:14,819 --> 00:28:17,569
Can anybody hear me?

258
00:28:17,697 --> 00:28:19,277
I'm lost!

259
00:28:36,716 --> 00:28:39,296
What do I do now, Hank?

260
00:28:39,386 --> 00:28:42,966
Manny... just look at them.

261
00:28:43,056 --> 00:28:44,966
Imagine them without their clothes on.

262
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:47,438
What's underneath their clothes?

263
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:49,479
You know, their...

264
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:53,192
boobs and vaginas, butts.

265
00:28:53,274 --> 00:28:55,824
Boobs, vaginas, and butts.

266
00:28:59,364 --> 00:29:01,994
- What do you do with those?
- Manny...

267
00:29:08,748 --> 00:29:11,328
You know, it used to be...

268
00:29:11,418 --> 00:29:15,918
really hard to come by a magazine like
that when I was a kid.

269
00:29:16,005 --> 00:29:19,295
I'd have to go digging
under the bushes by the freeway

270
00:29:19,384 --> 00:29:22,554
and sneak into my dad's stash.

271
00:29:22,637 --> 00:29:26,767
I mean, before the Internet,
every girl was a lot more special.

272
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:31,858
I bet you probably did the same thing,

273
00:29:31,938 --> 00:29:35,728
make up little love stories
for each of them.

274
00:29:35,817 --> 00:29:38,777
What kind of love stories?

275
00:29:41,281 --> 00:29:42,531
Well...

276
00:29:42,615 --> 00:29:47,655
her name might have been... Jessie.

277
00:29:47,787 --> 00:29:51,327
And you'd imagine

278
00:29:51,416 --> 00:29:55,916
bumping into her on the street
and whisking her off her feet.

279
00:29:56,004 --> 00:29:57,884
Sign a one-year lease together.

280
00:29:57,964 --> 00:29:59,803
Cook dinner together.

281
00:29:59,883 --> 00:30:02,472
Watch Netflix.

282
00:30:02,552 --> 00:30:04,182
Ah.

283
00:30:04,262 --> 00:30:05,972
Hank, something's...

284
00:30:06,055 --> 00:30:09,555
something's going wrong with my boobs.

285
00:30:09,642 --> 00:30:10,892
What do you mean?

286
00:30:10,977 --> 00:30:13,857
They're going crazy.

287
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:20,650
Holy shit.

288
00:30:22,822 --> 00:30:24,782
Ho... Oh, no. It's stopping.

289
00:30:24,866 --> 00:30:26,776
- Huh.
- Hey.

290
00:30:29,162 --> 00:30:32,210
What is Netflix?

291
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:33,670
Shit. Uh, n...

292
00:30:35,168 --> 00:30:36,498
Well, that's...

293
00:30:36,586 --> 00:30:39,586
Normally when you go on a date
with a girl,

294
00:30:39,672 --> 00:30:42,929
you'd take her to the theater
to watch a movie,

295
00:30:43,009 --> 00:30:46,219
but when you're... when you're truly
comfortable with someone,

296
00:30:46,304 --> 00:30:48,351
you stay at home and watch Netflix.

297
00:30:48,431 --> 00:30:50,854
Like, you and Jessie would probably stay
at home together all the time,

298
00:30:50,934 --> 00:30:53,440
watching movies.
You'd... You'd fall asleep on the couch,

299
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,609
unless you were throwing
one of your awesome parties.

300
00:30:56,689 --> 00:30:58,859
Then a few years later, you'd...
you'd get married.

301
00:30:58,942 --> 00:31:00,488
You'd have a... a small wedding,

302
00:31:00,568 --> 00:31:02,948
nothing big, and... and you'd have twins,

303
00:31:03,029 --> 00:31:06,161
and you'd have to get a second job to pay
the bills, but you wouldn't care, because...

304
00:31:06,241 --> 00:31:08,496
because you'd be going camping
all the time with your family, and...

305
00:31:08,576 --> 00:31:11,040
and you'd tell her she looks
even more beautiful with gray hairs.

306
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,580
Manny.

307
00:31:12,664 --> 00:31:15,584
Manny, I think my love story
is bringing you back to life!

308
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:17,457
Oh! Whoa! Whoa!

309
00:31:17,544 --> 00:31:19,048
- It's moving!
- What's happening?

310
00:31:20,755 --> 00:31:22,045
- What is that?
- It's alive!

311
00:31:22,131 --> 00:31:24,179
- What is it?
- It's moving!

312
00:31:24,259 --> 00:31:26,179
Oh, God, I'm disgusting!

313
00:31:26,261 --> 00:31:28,011
No, no. No, no, no, you're not disgusting.

314
00:31:28,096 --> 00:31:30,266
No, my body is disgusting. It's horrible!

315
00:31:30,348 --> 00:31:33,271
No, it's okay. This happens to everybody.
This happens to everybody, it's normal.

316
00:31:33,351 --> 00:31:36,731
- Really? Okay.
- Yeah. Uh...

317
00:31:38,648 --> 00:31:39,898
It's okay. Calm down.

318
00:31:39,983 --> 00:31:41,733
Hey. Hey.

319
00:31:41,818 --> 00:31:43,068
Hey.

320
00:31:43,152 --> 00:31:45,200
Hey. Let's just...

321
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:48,030
Let's just take this away for a second.

322
00:31:48,116 --> 00:31:51,196
Calm down. It's okay.

323
00:31:51,286 --> 00:31:52,536
Okay.

324
00:31:59,294 --> 00:32:00,632
Holy shit.

325
00:32:02,046 --> 00:32:03,296
Jessie.

326
00:32:59,687 --> 00:33:03,317
Manny, I think your penis
is guiding us home.

327
00:33:03,399 --> 00:33:05,399
Oh.

328
00:33:22,126 --> 00:33:25,456
Hey, nothing's happening, Hank.
You think I'm broken?

329
00:33:25,546 --> 00:33:27,466
Ah, that's okay.

330
00:33:27,548 --> 00:33:31,758
Look, sometimes when you do something
too many times,

331
00:33:31,844 --> 00:33:34,142
it has less of an effect.

332
00:33:34,222 --> 00:33:36,519
It's like the... the law
of diminishing returns.

333
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:38,139
It happens to everyone.

334
00:33:38,226 --> 00:33:40,976
That's why there are so many fetishes
out there.

335
00:33:41,062 --> 00:33:43,860
- Fetishes?
- Yeah.

336
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:48,360
See, everybody has
their own special tastes.

337
00:33:48,444 --> 00:33:52,869
Girls must be so nice if they let guys
do all those things to them.

338
00:33:52,949 --> 00:33:55,119
Yes, they are very nice.

339
00:33:55,201 --> 00:33:57,911
Remember when you put
that cork in my butt?

340
00:33:58,037 --> 00:33:59,247
Yeah.

341
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:01,500
- Did that count as sex?
- Manny, no.

342
00:34:03,167 --> 00:34:04,957
I wanna have sex.

343
00:34:05,044 --> 00:34:08,301
I wish there was some way
I could pretend to do it.

344
00:34:08,381 --> 00:34:09,631
It's called masturbation.

345
00:34:09,716 --> 00:34:11,626
It's kinda like sex.

346
00:34:11,718 --> 00:34:14,178
- But by yourself?
- Yeah.

347
00:34:14,262 --> 00:34:16,682
Masturbating makes people happy?

348
00:34:16,764 --> 00:34:18,019
It's supposed to, sure.

349
00:34:18,099 --> 00:34:20,019
I bet you masturbate a lot.

350
00:34:20,101 --> 00:34:22,398
I can't believe we're talking about this.

351
00:34:22,478 --> 00:34:26,268
Manny, people aren't supposed to talk
about this stuff.

352
00:34:30,361 --> 00:34:33,611
Look, I just don't do it very much.

353
00:34:33,698 --> 00:34:37,328
The first time my dad caught me
looking at one of those magazines,

354
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:39,200
he got really upset.

355
00:34:39,287 --> 00:34:40,747
Why?

356
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:44,830
Well, I guess parents don't like knowing

357
00:34:44,917 --> 00:34:48,207
that their kids look
at that kind of stuff.

358
00:34:48,296 --> 00:34:50,206
That's why they tell them they'll...

359
00:34:50,298 --> 00:34:53,258
they'll go to hell or go blind.

360
00:34:53,342 --> 00:34:55,342
But my dad...

361
00:34:59,724 --> 00:35:03,439
He didn't believe in that stuff,
so my dad said,

362
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:07,399
"Hank, uh, when you... you know,

363
00:35:07,482 --> 00:35:09,692
uh, it expends energy,

364
00:35:09,776 --> 00:35:12,646
both in the... in the orgasm

365
00:35:12,737 --> 00:35:14,447
and in the daily reproduction of sperm,

366
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:18,990
so... so if you do it a lot, it adds up,
and it shortens your life span,

367
00:35:19,118 --> 00:35:21,998
and that's why, on average, males
have shorter life spans,

368
00:35:22,121 --> 00:35:24,961
because they... you know."

369
00:35:25,041 --> 00:35:27,630
So you were scared of death?

370
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:32,760
Yeah. I... I was pretty upset.

371
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:36,139
And then my mom saw that I was crying,

372
00:35:36,219 --> 00:35:39,389
and so she said this ridiculous thing.

373
00:35:39,472 --> 00:35:45,272
She said that she was 40 and I was 11 and,

374
00:35:45,353 --> 00:35:49,068
if I masturbated enough,
I could catch up to her

375
00:35:49,148 --> 00:35:54,068
and, that way, we could die on the exact
same day and never be apart.

376
00:35:54,153 --> 00:35:56,993
I think she was trying to be funny.

377
00:35:57,073 --> 00:35:58,953
Oh.

378
00:35:59,033 --> 00:36:00,283
Ah, it's not funny.

379
00:36:00,368 --> 00:36:02,328
Oh. Okay.

380
00:36:02,411 --> 00:36:03,831
She had a weird sense of humor.

381
00:36:03,913 --> 00:36:05,209
And even if she was right,

382
00:36:05,289 --> 00:36:09,499
I wouldn't have been able to jack off
fast enough to catch up.

383
00:36:09,585 --> 00:36:12,625
She died shortly after.

384
00:36:12,713 --> 00:36:16,884
And so now, when you masturbate,
you think about your mom.

385
00:36:16,968 --> 00:36:20,298
Ah, Manny, no. That's weird.

386
00:36:20,388 --> 00:36:23,348
Weird?

387
00:36:23,432 --> 00:36:27,732
Weird is like... when you do stuff
that nobody else does,

388
00:36:27,812 --> 00:36:29,062
so they make fun of you for it.

389
00:36:29,188 --> 00:36:32,438
So when I say that I can't masturbate

390
00:36:32,525 --> 00:36:34,985
because it makes me think about my mom,
people laugh at you.

391
00:36:35,069 --> 00:36:38,159
But that's fun.
Making people laugh is great.

392
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:42,288
It's not, because they call you names
like Hanky Wanky,

393
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:47,328
you have to change schools,
and it's... it's not fun.

394
00:36:47,415 --> 00:36:51,375
Hank, when I masturbate,
I'm gonna think about your mom.

395
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:53,340
Manny, stop.

396
00:36:53,421 --> 00:36:56,091
But if I think about your mom
when I masturbate,

397
00:36:56,215 --> 00:36:59,385
- then you won't be weird anymore, right?
- No. Just quit talking.

398
00:36:59,468 --> 00:37:01,298
- I'm just trying to help.
- Well, you're not,

399
00:37:01,387 --> 00:37:03,807
so stop talking and stop asking questions.

400
00:37:05,808 --> 00:37:07,348
Should I just go back to being dead?

401
00:37:07,435 --> 00:37:09,845
Yes, you should. Die in a fire.

402
00:37:18,237 --> 00:37:20,737
Manny, hey.

403
00:37:20,823 --> 00:37:23,203
Manny, I'm sorry I got upset.

404
00:37:23,284 --> 00:37:25,914
Focus. Are we going the right way?

405
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:28,579
Manny.

406
00:37:29,957 --> 00:37:31,537
Buddy, I need you.

407
00:37:31,626 --> 00:37:34,836
I need you, your special compass.

408
00:37:39,717 --> 00:37:43,347
Okay.

409
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,448
Holy...

410
00:37:59,528 --> 00:38:02,278
Something enormous took a dump here.

411
00:38:02,365 --> 00:38:03,695
We better be careful.

412
00:38:03,783 --> 00:38:05,163
Ohh!

413
00:38:06,786 --> 00:38:08,116
Careful.

414
00:38:23,511 --> 00:38:24,931
- Hey, Hank.
- Quiet.

415
00:38:25,012 --> 00:38:27,182
I thought you wanted me
to start talking again.

416
00:38:27,306 --> 00:38:28,686
I do. But right now,
I need you to be quiet.

417
00:38:28,766 --> 00:38:32,766
Well, I'm still not very good at
controlling the volume of my voice, Hank.

418
00:38:32,853 --> 00:38:34,108
- You have to teach me...
- Manny.

419
00:38:34,188 --> 00:38:37,108
What is your face doing?
Why are your eyes so big?

420
00:38:37,191 --> 00:38:40,571
Manny, this is what fear looks like.

421
00:38:40,653 --> 00:38:42,783
Why are you afraid of that poop?

422
00:38:42,863 --> 00:38:46,120
- I'm scared of whatever took that poop.
- But why, though?

423
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,490
Because only huge, scary things
take poops that big.

424
00:38:48,577 --> 00:38:51,077
So what? Everything poops.

425
00:38:51,163 --> 00:38:54,213
Yes, but if it finds us, it will eat us

426
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:57,882
and push us out its butt
and turn us into poop.

427
00:39:01,841 --> 00:39:03,091
Aah! Manny, run!

428
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:08,100
Hank!

429
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:10,890
Why are we moving so fast?

430
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:26,779
What...

431
00:39:28,117 --> 00:39:29,537
Raah!

432
00:39:42,131 --> 00:39:43,381
Wow.

433
00:39:45,509 --> 00:39:46,759
Hank.

434
00:39:48,054 --> 00:39:49,724
What am I looking at?

435
00:39:51,515 --> 00:39:54,885
That's a... a phone.

436
00:39:54,977 --> 00:39:56,807
Phone is beautiful.

437
00:39:56,896 --> 00:40:01,396
No, no, no, no, no. That's just a picture
of a girl on a phone.

438
00:40:01,484 --> 00:40:05,449
What? Where'd it go? What are you doing?
What are you doing?

439
00:40:05,529 --> 00:40:08,414
- We should turn it off to save power.
- No. But it's mine.

440
00:40:09,408 --> 00:40:11,408
Manny...

441
00:40:12,453 --> 00:40:15,209
The phone is on low battery
with no signal.

442
00:40:15,289 --> 00:40:18,379
We've gotta turn it off so we can find
help once we're closer to home.

443
00:40:18,459 --> 00:40:22,709
I have a lot of questions
about all the things you just said.

444
00:40:24,965 --> 00:40:26,585
Just trust me.

445
00:40:26,675 --> 00:40:27,965
Hmm?

446
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,600
Just trust me.

447
00:40:47,613 --> 00:40:48,863
Fuck.

448
00:41:05,089 --> 00:41:08,009
Can I look at her again?

449
00:41:19,645 --> 00:41:22,605
Can I see her again?

450
00:41:40,875 --> 00:41:42,785
Now can I see her?

451
00:41:44,003 --> 00:41:45,253
Please?

452
00:41:53,053 --> 00:41:55,059
Maybe...

453
00:41:55,639 --> 00:41:59,809
Maybe you could dress up, like before,

454
00:41:59,894 --> 00:42:02,774
so I could remember?

455
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,150
Dress up?

456
00:42:06,233 --> 00:42:09,323
No, Manny, we need to find food.

457
00:42:09,403 --> 00:42:12,493
We need to get out of here,
or else I'm going to die.

458
00:42:12,573 --> 00:42:15,203
But we've tried all of those things.

459
00:42:15,284 --> 00:42:18,624
Hank, what if I knew her?

460
00:42:18,704 --> 00:42:21,752
Maybe she's my friend,

461
00:42:21,832 --> 00:42:26,382
or my girlfriend or my wife.

462
00:42:26,462 --> 00:42:30,592
It's like you said,
love is bringing me back to life.

463
00:42:30,674 --> 00:42:33,844
I'm your multipurpose tool guy.

464
00:42:35,846 --> 00:42:37,096
That sounds really...

465
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,700
Stupid.

466
00:42:52,863 --> 00:42:56,453
Hurry, before you starve and die.

467
00:43:05,459 --> 00:43:08,419
- Oh, my God.
- I'm sorry.

468
00:43:08,504 --> 00:43:09,964
You look beautiful.

469
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:13,720
You think I look beautiful?

470
00:43:13,801 --> 00:43:16,140
Of course I do.

471
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:18,470
No, I... Really?

472
00:43:20,432 --> 00:43:21,682
Well, is it working?

473
00:43:21,767 --> 00:43:23,387
Are... Are you remembering anything?

474
00:43:23,477 --> 00:43:25,597
Uh...

475
00:43:25,688 --> 00:43:27,608
yeah.

476
00:43:30,276 --> 00:43:33,146
What's my name?

477
00:43:33,237 --> 00:43:36,907
Laura...

478
00:43:38,492 --> 00:43:40,831
- Dern?
- Manny!

479
00:43:40,911 --> 00:43:44,331
Oh, no! Hank, I'm so sorry.
Please, let me try again.

480
00:43:44,415 --> 00:43:46,170
Do you have any idea what people
back at home would think

481
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:48,631
- if they saw me dressed like this?
- Oh, but let me try one more time.

482
00:43:48,711 --> 00:43:51,091
Hank, please.

483
00:43:52,631 --> 00:43:56,590
But now that I've seen her,
I can't get her out of my head,

484
00:43:56,677 --> 00:44:01,097
and I don't know if that's a thing
that happens or if I'm just weird,

485
00:44:01,181 --> 00:44:04,601
but something tells me she is the one
I'm supposed to bump into

486
00:44:04,685 --> 00:44:06,305
and spend the rest of my life with,

487
00:44:06,395 --> 00:44:09,265
and maybe if we can just find a way for me
to remember her,

488
00:44:09,356 --> 00:44:11,566
then, bam, it'll all come
rushing back to me,

489
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:15,990
and the hairs on the back of my neck
will stand up, and I can save you.

490
00:44:20,409 --> 00:44:22,579
Wow. That talking was good.

491
00:44:22,661 --> 00:44:24,871
Yeah. See? It's working already.

492
00:44:24,955 --> 00:44:27,455
What are you doing?

493
00:44:27,541 --> 00:44:29,541
I'm singing a song
so you won't overthink things.

494
00:45:07,623 --> 00:45:08,923
Well?

495
00:45:09,917 --> 00:45:11,587
Uh...

496
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:13,340
What should I do now?

497
00:45:15,631 --> 00:45:16,921
Um...

498
00:45:17,007 --> 00:45:18,507
okay, maybe you talk to her.

499
00:45:18,592 --> 00:45:20,180
What do I talk about?

500
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:22,930
Just, you know, whatever comes naturally.

501
00:45:26,809 --> 00:45:28,349
Hello.

502
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:31,650
I don't know why,

503
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:36,610
but I have this sudden urge
to put my mouth on your mouth.

504
00:45:36,735 --> 00:45:39,105
Okay, that's called kissing,
but you can't do that yet.

505
00:45:39,196 --> 00:45:40,446
That's too fast.

506
00:45:40,531 --> 00:45:41,781
Oh. Uh...

507
00:45:41,865 --> 00:45:44,195
How 'bout if I put my penis in you?

508
00:45:44,284 --> 00:45:46,664
- That's even worse.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

509
00:45:46,745 --> 00:45:49,872
What about if I just did the tip,
like, just the very beginning...

510
00:45:49,957 --> 00:45:53,247
Okay, Manny, it's not about sex.
Okay? It's...

511
00:46:06,306 --> 00:46:08,386
Okay.

512
00:46:09,852 --> 00:46:11,899
Okay.

513
00:46:11,979 --> 00:46:13,229
Welcome to the bus.

514
00:46:13,313 --> 00:46:17,363
This is how people like us get places
if we're too poor to drive ourselves.

515
00:46:19,987 --> 00:46:21,447
Oh, yeah.

516
00:46:21,530 --> 00:46:23,070
There are other people.

517
00:46:23,157 --> 00:46:24,617
Yeah.

518
00:46:27,494 --> 00:46:29,874
Hello. Hello, everybody.

519
00:46:29,955 --> 00:46:32,535
Buses are for people
who don't know each other.

520
00:46:32,624 --> 00:46:34,630
They read books. They listen to music.

521
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:36,507
- And we all sing songs together, right?
- No!

522
00:46:36,587 --> 00:46:38,467
No, no, no, the other people
will stare at you if you sing,

523
00:46:38,547 --> 00:46:40,087
so you listen to your own music.

524
00:46:40,174 --> 00:46:41,934
- Oh.
- Here.

525
00:46:43,886 --> 00:46:45,846
# If it hadn't been #

526
00:46:45,929 --> 00:46:50,229
# For Cotton Eye Joe #

527
00:46:50,309 --> 00:46:53,849
# I'd be married #

528
00:46:53,937 --> 00:46:56,897
# A long time ago... #

529
00:46:56,982 --> 00:46:59,071
As you listen...

530
00:46:59,151 --> 00:47:01,861
stare out the window.

531
00:47:01,945 --> 00:47:05,315
Oh. And I watch the world go by.

532
00:47:05,407 --> 00:47:09,037
# Wasn't for Cotton Eye #

533
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:12,329
# Cotton Eye Joe... #

534
00:47:12,414 --> 00:47:15,212
So this is it.

535
00:47:15,292 --> 00:47:18,712
This is the life I've forgotten.

536
00:47:20,214 --> 00:47:22,761
Oh, when I get back home,

537
00:47:22,841 --> 00:47:27,221
I am gonna ride the bus every day.

538
00:47:27,304 --> 00:47:30,269
Manny, this is just the beginning.

539
00:47:30,349 --> 00:47:33,599
Every day, you ride the bus
and count the minutes,

540
00:47:33,685 --> 00:47:35,345
hoping you'll see her again.

541
00:47:39,566 --> 00:47:41,276
Oh, my God.

542
00:47:57,376 --> 00:48:00,416
She smiles,

543
00:48:00,504 --> 00:48:03,594
and you feel a strange tingle
up the back of your neck.

544
00:48:04,716 --> 00:48:09,046
Something carnal inside of you
causes your body to break out in sweats.

545
00:48:09,137 --> 00:48:12,467
You feel like the luckiest man
in the world.

546
00:48:12,558 --> 00:48:15,438
She sits alone, just like every other day,

547
00:48:15,519 --> 00:48:17,399
and looks out the window
lost in her thoughts.

548
00:48:17,479 --> 00:48:21,019
You know that look.
She's just as alone as you are.

549
00:48:21,108 --> 00:48:25,318
But she doesn't have to be.
You could talk to her.

550
00:48:25,404 --> 00:48:30,120
Tell her you'd love to sit next to her
today and every other day,

551
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:34,249
because life is short, and no one deserves
to ride the bus alone.

552
00:48:34,329 --> 00:48:35,869
I want this to stop.

553
00:48:35,956 --> 00:48:37,496
- It's not working?
- No.

554
00:48:37,583 --> 00:48:38,962
She's too beautiful.

555
00:48:39,042 --> 00:48:41,298
I can't talk to her now.

556
00:48:41,378 --> 00:48:43,758
What if I say something stupid?
I'll just wanna die.

557
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:47,429
She's right there.
You're not gonna do anything?

558
00:48:48,677 --> 00:48:51,177
What would you do?

559
00:48:51,263 --> 00:48:53,273
I would...

560
00:48:54,766 --> 00:48:58,186
I would probably wait,

561
00:48:58,270 --> 00:49:01,440
and watch her get off the bus

562
00:49:01,523 --> 00:49:05,693
and go home and eat
a whole box of pizza by myself.

563
00:49:08,447 --> 00:49:12,027
Manny, I should tell you the truth.
I'm not really good at this stuff.

564
00:49:13,118 --> 00:49:15,618
Oh, right. Nobody loves you.

565
00:49:29,551 --> 00:49:31,011
Try these on.

566
00:49:32,012 --> 00:49:33,762
My eyeballs can't see as well.

567
00:49:33,847 --> 00:49:36,637
But you look mysterious,
and girls like mysterious.

568
00:49:36,725 --> 00:49:39,435
- You feel cool, right?
- I guess.

569
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:42,439
- You look cool.
- Oh! What are you doing?

570
00:49:42,522 --> 00:49:44,319
All you have to do is talk to her.

571
00:49:44,399 --> 00:49:45,979
- I believe in you.
- Whoa!

572
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,460
Are you sitting alone?

573
00:50:04,878 --> 00:50:08,088
- Yeah.
- So you're a freak.

574
00:50:08,173 --> 00:50:09,843
What?

575
00:50:11,593 --> 00:50:13,223
Now you're not.

576
00:50:15,472 --> 00:50:17,392
So what are you listening to?

577
00:50:17,474 --> 00:50:19,734
It's a song I wrote for you.

578
00:50:35,367 --> 00:50:37,657
- Hank?
- Hmm?

579
00:50:37,744 --> 00:50:40,254
Pick up my hand.

580
00:50:41,581 --> 00:50:44,041
Okay, now put it on her hand.

581
00:50:51,466 --> 00:50:54,386
Okay. I wanna look at her.

582
00:50:59,891 --> 00:51:01,771
My name is Manny.

583
00:51:04,896 --> 00:51:06,646
My name is S...

584
00:51:08,942 --> 00:51:11,112
Sarah.

585
00:51:11,194 --> 00:51:12,532
Sarah.

586
00:51:12,612 --> 00:51:14,362
That's her name?

587
00:51:14,448 --> 00:51:16,028
Sarah Johnson.

588
00:51:16,116 --> 00:51:18,536
- Sarah Johnson?
- Yeah, Sarah Johnson.

589
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:21,580
Manny, your face.

590
00:51:21,663 --> 00:51:23,833
Oh, this is what
I look like when I'm happy.

591
00:51:23,915 --> 00:51:26,075
We have to get home, Hank.

592
00:51:26,168 --> 00:51:28,798
We have to get home, so I can find Sarah

593
00:51:28,879 --> 00:51:30,509
and have twins with her and work two jobs

594
00:51:30,589 --> 00:51:31,919
- and grow old.
- Manny, my hand.

595
00:51:39,681 --> 00:51:41,561
Manny, help me get home.

596
00:51:50,734 --> 00:51:53,198
# Pop popcorn, pop popcorn #

597
00:51:53,278 --> 00:51:55,568
# Pop popcorn, pop popcorn #

598
00:51:55,655 --> 00:51:57,775
# Pop popcorn, pop popcorn #

599
00:51:57,866 --> 00:51:59,826
# Pop popcorn, pop popcorn #

600
00:51:59,910 --> 00:52:02,540
# Pop popcorn, pop popcorn #

601
00:52:02,621 --> 00:52:04,918
# Pop popcorn, pop popcorn #

602
00:52:04,998 --> 00:52:07,248
# Pop popcorn, pop popcorn #

603
00:52:07,334 --> 00:52:09,339
# Pop popcorn, pop popcorn #

604
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:26,940
Wow.

605
00:52:27,938 --> 00:52:30,478
# Bah bah bah, bah bah bah #

606
00:52:30,565 --> 00:52:32,605
# Bah bah bah, bah bah bah #

607
00:52:32,692 --> 00:52:35,072
# Bah bah bah, bah bah bah #

608
00:52:35,153 --> 00:52:37,242
# Bah bah bah, bah bah bah #

609
00:52:37,322 --> 00:52:39,369
# Bah bah bah, bah bah bah #

610
00:52:39,449 --> 00:52:41,829
# Bah bah bah, bah bah bah #

611
00:52:41,910 --> 00:52:43,999
# Bah bah bah, bah bah bah #

612
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:46,919
# Bah bah bah, bah bah bah #

613
00:53:00,345 --> 00:53:02,135
# Now we killed a raccoon #

614
00:53:02,222 --> 00:53:04,311
# We are using your body
like it's a machine gun #

615
00:53:04,391 --> 00:53:06,521
# Now we are shooting some fish #

616
00:53:06,601 --> 00:53:07,851
# Our friendship is blossoming #

617
00:53:07,936 --> 00:53:09,766
# Let's eat the stuff we killed #

618
00:53:09,855 --> 00:53:11,765
# Now we started a fire #

619
00:53:11,857 --> 00:53:13,977
# I have to admit
I'm enjoying your company #

620
00:53:14,067 --> 00:53:18,907
# Are we falling in love? #

621
00:53:18,989 --> 00:53:21,989
# All we ever needed

622
00:53:22,075 --> 00:53:28,075
# Is a montage #

623
00:53:31,293 --> 00:53:33,093
Oh.

624
00:53:35,255 --> 00:53:36,795
What was that?

625
00:53:45,056 --> 00:53:49,016
# True #

626
00:53:49,102 --> 00:53:54,152
# Friendship #

627
00:54:13,293 --> 00:54:14,543
Vodka.

628
00:54:15,921 --> 00:54:17,171
Let's have a party.

629
00:54:17,255 --> 00:54:19,465
Yeah. Let's invite everyone we know.

630
00:54:19,549 --> 00:54:24,049
Everyone! We're having a party!

631
00:54:55,001 --> 00:54:57,501
Manny, I need to tell you
something. You...

632
00:54:57,587 --> 00:54:59,207
Whoo! Whoa!

633
00:55:00,632 --> 00:55:02,842
Little tipsy.

634
00:55:02,926 --> 00:55:04,966
Whoa.

635
00:55:07,305 --> 00:55:08,965
Sarah...

636
00:55:11,851 --> 00:55:14,441
I think you're the one.

637
00:55:15,689 --> 00:55:18,609
I've never been happier.

638
00:55:19,985 --> 00:55:22,815
Manny... look at me.

639
00:55:28,576 --> 00:55:31,616
The more you're gonna see of me,
the more you're not gonna like me.

640
00:55:33,039 --> 00:55:34,709
It's diminishing returns and whatever.

641
00:55:36,876 --> 00:55:41,296
- Sarah, do you ever masturbate?
- What?

642
00:55:41,381 --> 00:55:43,011
I have this friend called Hank

643
00:55:43,091 --> 00:55:46,931
and he won't masturbate,
'cause it makes him think about his mom.

644
00:55:47,012 --> 00:55:51,392
Manny, that... that was between us.

645
00:55:51,474 --> 00:55:54,274
No, listen. Sarah...

646
00:55:56,146 --> 00:55:57,766
Sarah.

647
00:56:05,947 --> 00:56:10,947
So, Hank's mom died
when he was very, very little,

648
00:56:11,036 --> 00:56:15,246
and so it makes him upset
to think about her.

649
00:56:15,373 --> 00:56:18,793
And so even though masturbation
makes him happy,

650
00:56:18,877 --> 00:56:21,457
he won't do it.

651
00:56:21,546 --> 00:56:23,006
Okay.

652
00:56:23,089 --> 00:56:28,679
I don't know exactly what masturbation is
or how it works,

653
00:56:28,762 --> 00:56:35,230
but I guess it probably feels
a lot like the wind in your hair

654
00:56:35,310 --> 00:56:38,730
or driving really fast in a car

655
00:56:38,813 --> 00:56:42,193
or taking a bite out of your favorite food

656
00:56:42,275 --> 00:56:45,065
or dancing with your friends

657
00:56:45,153 --> 00:56:47,863
or singing your favorite song

658
00:56:47,947 --> 00:56:49,947
or riding the bus

659
00:56:50,033 --> 00:56:52,293
or looking out of windows.

660
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:55,830
Now, why would you ever say no to that?

661
00:56:55,914 --> 00:57:00,464
I just think his mom would want him
to be happy.

662
00:57:01,544 --> 00:57:03,133
Don't you?

663
00:57:03,213 --> 00:57:06,173
Yeah. I think so.

664
00:57:06,257 --> 00:57:11,177
And what would make you happy right now?

665
00:57:16,101 --> 00:57:17,441
Maybe...

666
00:57:24,275 --> 00:57:27,605
- I'm really drunk.
- Oh, yeah. Me, too.

667
00:57:30,615 --> 00:57:33,945
- We should go to bed.
- Yeah.

668
00:57:35,495 --> 00:57:40,535
Uh, Hank, will you just take my head
out of the window?

669
00:57:44,754 --> 00:57:46,514
Thank you.

670
00:57:49,926 --> 00:57:51,506
Sleep well.

671
00:58:10,363 --> 00:58:12,823
Morning, Hank.

672
00:58:12,907 --> 00:58:14,527
How'd you sleep?

673
00:58:22,375 --> 00:58:23,835
It's late.

674
00:58:23,918 --> 00:58:25,918
Better get a move on.

675
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:03,290
Hank, thanks to you,

676
00:59:03,374 --> 00:59:07,384
I'm gonna get to see her soon... for real.

677
00:59:31,069 --> 00:59:35,819
I have this feeling,
and I don't know what to call it.

678
00:59:39,953 --> 00:59:43,373
It's like I feel like even though
I'm on top of you right now,

679
00:59:43,456 --> 00:59:48,089
touching you physically,
there's something stuck in between us.

680
00:59:48,169 --> 00:59:49,419
Whoa!

681
00:59:51,965 --> 00:59:54,795
I also feel like
you have something to say,

682
00:59:54,884 --> 01:00:00,006
but you don't know what to say,
and so neither of us is saying anything,

683
01:00:00,098 --> 01:00:02,638
and for some reason,
I feel like this might go on forever.

684
01:00:02,725 --> 01:00:04,935
- Is that a thing?
- No, it's not a thing.

685
01:00:05,019 --> 01:00:07,809
So no one's ever felt this way before?

686
01:00:07,897 --> 01:00:12,817
You might be the first one ever
in the history of mankind.

687
01:00:12,902 --> 01:00:15,241
Oh.

688
01:00:15,321 --> 01:00:18,451
That has just made me
have another feeling, and I...

689
01:00:18,533 --> 01:00:20,622
Manny, please, no more feelings right now.

690
01:00:27,667 --> 01:00:29,537
Oh, wow.

691
01:00:29,627 --> 01:00:31,667
Oh, wow.

692
01:00:31,754 --> 01:00:35,470
Oh, Hank, I think...
I think I'm feeling fear.

693
01:00:35,550 --> 01:00:36,800
Not now, Manny.

694
01:00:36,884 --> 01:00:38,344
No, really, I'm scared.

695
01:00:38,428 --> 01:00:43,058
I'm scared, 'cause I think if I die,
I might really miss you.

696
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:47,020
Oh, you're the worst.

697
01:02:16,275 --> 01:02:20,655
# Heartless #

698
01:02:20,738 --> 01:02:26,038
# How were you heartless? #

699
01:02:26,119 --> 01:02:31,459
# I saw your sadness #

700
01:02:31,541 --> 01:02:37,961
# And made it my own #

701
01:02:39,215 --> 01:02:41,215
# Crazy # # Tell me if you don't mind #

702
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:44,430
# The immediate wonder,
the fatal attraction #

703
01:02:44,512 --> 01:02:47,518
# Totally crazy #
# Told you to run like the wind #

704
01:02:47,598 --> 01:02:49,348
# We've gotta depend on each other #

705
01:02:49,434 --> 01:02:53,483
- # We're fucking crazy #
- # I want to climb in your brain #

706
01:02:53,563 --> 01:02:55,401
# Devour the webbing,
and know your opinions #

707
01:02:55,481 --> 01:02:59,071
- # We won't ever stop #
- # But you're still afraid of the shame #

708
01:02:59,152 --> 01:03:01,902
# I promise I'll fix it,
it's all for a reason #

709
01:03:01,988 --> 01:03:04,408
# You just have to remember #

710
01:03:04,490 --> 01:03:07,030
# That we're all here for a purpose #

711
01:03:07,118 --> 01:03:10,458
# And the universe picks its time #

712
01:03:10,538 --> 01:03:13,538
# Everything, everywhere
matters to everything #

713
01:03:13,624 --> 01:03:16,464
# Everything, everywhere
matters to everything #

714
01:03:16,544 --> 01:03:19,133
# Everything, everywhere
matters to everything... #

715
01:03:19,213 --> 01:03:24,053
Are you excited to see everyone
when you get home?

716
01:03:24,135 --> 01:03:26,215
Yeah, I guess.

717
01:03:26,304 --> 01:03:28,474
You'll be able to see your dad.

718
01:03:28,556 --> 01:03:31,136
Yeah, he's probably been
wondering where you are.

719
01:03:31,225 --> 01:03:34,475
Well, we haven't really kept up.

720
01:03:34,562 --> 01:03:38,152
I mean, we tried the whole calling
each other on our birthdays thing,

721
01:03:38,232 --> 01:03:41,572
but, you know, that eventually went away.

722
01:03:41,652 --> 01:03:43,152
Why? What happened?

723
01:03:44,447 --> 01:03:48,117
Well, a few years back, he forgot to call.

724
01:03:48,201 --> 01:03:53,209
He didn't really know how to say
sorry, but I could tell he felt bad,

725
01:03:53,289 --> 01:03:57,338
so I taught him how to set up
an automated birthday e-card.

726
01:03:57,418 --> 01:03:59,878
That's like a letter
you get on your phone.

727
01:03:59,962 --> 01:04:02,552
It automatically sends me
a birthday card every year,

728
01:04:02,632 --> 01:04:04,552
so that way, he'll never forget.

729
01:04:04,634 --> 01:04:09,223
I mean, I always forgot his as well,
so I set one up, too.

730
01:04:09,305 --> 01:04:12,925
Wow. I wonder if my dad
and I did that, too.

731
01:04:13,017 --> 01:04:15,977
I hope I sent him
an automated card every day.

732
01:04:16,062 --> 01:04:18,151
It's nothing special.

733
01:04:18,231 --> 01:04:19,691
If I died out here,

734
01:04:19,774 --> 01:04:23,614
some website would send him a birthday
card every year for the rest of his life.

735
01:04:23,694 --> 01:04:25,864
He probably wouldn't even know I was gone.

736
01:04:25,947 --> 01:04:27,697
Well, that's not true. He cares about you.

737
01:04:27,782 --> 01:04:29,032
Yeah.

738
01:04:30,201 --> 01:04:31,451
Yeah, he's my dad.

739
01:04:31,536 --> 01:04:33,906
But he just doesn't...

740
01:04:33,996 --> 01:04:36,826
I mean, he ought to show it sometimes.

741
01:04:36,916 --> 01:04:39,246
Why wouldn't he want to show that?

742
01:04:41,462 --> 01:04:44,802
Neither of us were good at talking.

743
01:04:44,882 --> 01:04:48,681
Sometimes it's hard for people
to show how they feel.

744
01:04:48,761 --> 01:04:50,558
That's retarded.

745
01:04:50,638 --> 01:04:53,218
- Manny, don't use that word.
- When I get back home,

746
01:04:53,307 --> 01:04:57,187
I'm gonna show Sarah how much I care
about her every single day.

747
01:04:57,270 --> 01:05:00,359
Whenever she wants, she's thirsty
or whatever, she can drink my spit,

748
01:05:00,439 --> 01:05:03,689
and then she can ride my gas
to wherever she wants to go.

749
01:05:03,776 --> 01:05:06,276
You can't use your gas in front
of other people.

750
01:05:06,362 --> 01:05:08,032
What? Why not?

751
01:05:08,114 --> 01:05:10,369
Because it's weird.

752
01:05:10,449 --> 01:05:12,699
People don't like other people's farts.

753
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:17,120
Is that why you don't fart in front of me?

754
01:05:17,206 --> 01:05:19,126
No. I just...

755
01:05:19,208 --> 01:05:23,088
like to do it alone or hold it in.

756
01:05:23,170 --> 01:05:25,090
That's what you're supposed to do.

757
01:05:25,172 --> 01:05:27,132
That's so sad.

758
01:05:28,384 --> 01:05:30,304
That's so sad!

759
01:05:30,386 --> 01:05:32,846
What are we even going back home for?

760
01:05:32,930 --> 01:05:36,229
It sounds like you're not allowed to do
anything back there.

761
01:05:36,309 --> 01:05:38,809
Yeah.

762
01:05:38,936 --> 01:05:42,476
Maybe we should just stay out here.

763
01:05:42,565 --> 01:05:44,395
And never go home?

764
01:05:46,193 --> 01:05:47,949
This'll be our home.

765
01:05:48,029 --> 01:05:51,779
We could make our own rules
and do whatever we want to.

766
01:05:51,866 --> 01:05:53,486
Ah, we could start a band.

767
01:05:53,576 --> 01:05:56,036
And we could build a house in the trees.

768
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:58,330
Yeah, with a home movie theater system.

769
01:05:58,414 --> 01:05:59,752
And a recording studio.

770
01:05:59,832 --> 01:06:01,629
Yeah, we could sing songs
as loud as we want.

771
01:06:01,709 --> 01:06:03,339
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

772
01:06:03,419 --> 01:06:04,749
Yeah.

773
01:06:04,837 --> 01:06:07,547
- Yeah, you and me.
- Yeah. Heh.

774
01:06:15,097 --> 01:06:16,967
I have to pee.

775
01:06:50,675 --> 01:06:53,835
# I'm sitting on this rock #

776
01:06:53,928 --> 01:06:56,678
# Such a comfy rock #

777
01:06:56,764 --> 01:07:01,564
# Hank's gone to pee #

778
01:07:01,644 --> 01:07:04,609
# It is so nice here #

779
01:07:04,689 --> 01:07:07,689
# Nice and dark and warm #

780
01:07:07,775 --> 01:07:09,685
# Hank's gone... #

781
01:07:50,359 --> 01:07:52,489
Manny, I have something
amazing to show you,

782
01:07:52,570 --> 01:07:54,075
but I need to tell you something first.

783
01:07:54,155 --> 01:07:55,865
Hank, I have something to say to you, too.

784
01:07:55,948 --> 01:07:57,448
No, I need to go first.

785
01:07:57,533 --> 01:08:00,748
Look... I needed you to help me get home,

786
01:08:00,828 --> 01:08:04,578
and then one thing led to another,
and then suddenly I had a friend,

787
01:08:04,665 --> 01:08:07,455
and I was too scared
to tell you the truth,

788
01:08:07,543 --> 01:08:11,258
but this is my phone, Manny, not yours.

789
01:08:11,338 --> 01:08:13,508
And Sarah...

790
01:08:13,591 --> 01:08:17,341
is a girl I saw on the bus every day,

791
01:08:17,428 --> 01:08:19,678
but I never had the courage
to even talk to her.

792
01:08:19,764 --> 01:08:23,020
I didn't think someone like her
would ever wanna be with me.

793
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:25,189
I didn't even wanna be with me.

794
01:08:25,269 --> 01:08:26,519
Eventually...

795
01:08:26,604 --> 01:08:27,984
What?

796
01:08:28,105 --> 01:08:29,777
Yeah, that's what I wanted
to tell you, Hank.

797
01:08:29,857 --> 01:08:31,570
There's a giant raccoon,
and it's eating our food.

798
01:08:31,650 --> 01:08:32,690
Shh.

799
01:08:40,493 --> 01:08:43,413
What were you saying about Sarah?

800
01:08:50,544 --> 01:08:51,804
Sarah.

801
01:08:54,298 --> 01:08:55,548
Manny.

802
01:08:55,633 --> 01:08:58,723
Manny. Manny!

803
01:08:59,929 --> 01:09:01,559
Down.

804
01:09:04,058 --> 01:09:06,058
What was Sarah doing with that guy?

805
01:09:06,143 --> 01:09:08,523
That's her real life.
Can we talk about it later?

806
01:09:10,356 --> 01:09:12,476
She was never even mine?

807
01:09:12,566 --> 01:09:14,236
Why didn't you tell me?

808
01:09:14,318 --> 01:09:16,568
I wanted to.

809
01:09:16,654 --> 01:09:18,114
I was too embarrassed.

810
01:09:20,241 --> 01:09:22,411
Embarrassed?

811
01:09:23,953 --> 01:09:25,873
You made me think I was in love
with someone

812
01:09:25,955 --> 01:09:27,865
who never even knew I existed,

813
01:09:27,957 --> 01:09:31,497
but I'm just a lonely,
loser weirdo, really?

814
01:09:32,586 --> 01:09:34,206
We don't need her anymore!

815
01:09:38,050 --> 01:09:40,760
We got each other!

816
01:09:42,930 --> 01:09:45,180
Shit, shit, shit.

817
01:09:51,063 --> 01:09:52,443
Wow.

818
01:09:58,279 --> 01:09:59,529
Oof!

819
01:10:07,037 --> 01:10:08,287
Look.

820
01:10:14,211 --> 01:10:15,461
Hey!

821
01:10:15,546 --> 01:10:18,006
Hey! Look over here! Please help us!

822
01:10:18,090 --> 01:10:19,470
What is this?

823
01:10:19,550 --> 01:10:21,138
Those are cars, Manny.
If we can get down...

824
01:10:21,218 --> 01:10:24,138
I know those are fucking cars.
I'm talking about life.

825
01:10:25,306 --> 01:10:27,266
What is life?

826
01:10:27,349 --> 01:10:29,769
Manny...

827
01:10:29,852 --> 01:10:32,562
what is that flashing in my head? It...

828
01:10:32,646 --> 01:10:35,106
Are you crying?

829
01:10:36,650 --> 01:10:39,490
I don't know. Is this crying?

830
01:10:39,570 --> 01:10:41,860
I don't like it.

831
01:10:41,947 --> 01:10:45,117
It's wet and uncomfortable,

832
01:10:45,242 --> 01:10:48,249
and, oh, God, why am I shaking now?

833
01:10:48,329 --> 01:10:50,539
Just breathe. This is normal.

834
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:53,503
Just try to think about happy thoughts.

835
01:10:53,584 --> 01:10:55,422
I'm...

836
01:10:55,502 --> 01:10:58,632
Manny, whatever
you are doing, please stop.

837
01:10:58,714 --> 01:11:00,634
I'm... I'm just thinking.

838
01:11:00,716 --> 01:11:03,006
- Well, stop thinking.
- I can't help it.

839
01:11:04,053 --> 01:11:08,352
This is a thought, and this is a thought,

840
01:11:08,432 --> 01:11:09,979
and this is a thought,

841
01:11:10,059 --> 01:11:13,439
thought, thought, thought.

842
01:11:14,647 --> 01:11:16,647
These are all thoughts,

843
01:11:16,732 --> 01:11:20,030
and sometimes thoughts
become other thoughts.

844
01:11:23,656 --> 01:11:26,736
Thoughts like, if my best friend
keeps his farts from me...

845
01:11:34,583 --> 01:11:36,673
...what else is he hiding from me?

846
01:11:40,798 --> 01:11:44,008
And why does that thought
make me feel so alone?

847
01:11:44,093 --> 01:11:46,973
Manny, we have to try to think
about something else.

848
01:11:47,054 --> 01:11:49,560
It's not healthy to fixate
on these things.

849
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:52,140
I just had a thought about a thought.

850
01:11:52,226 --> 01:11:57,816
How do you hide your thoughts,
and why do we have to hide everything?

851
01:12:00,484 --> 01:12:04,241
Manny, this is just another power
your body has.

852
01:12:04,321 --> 01:12:05,821
You can learn to control it.

853
01:12:05,906 --> 01:12:08,446
So I guess my brain is just weird, too?

854
01:12:10,327 --> 01:12:13,247
What do you do with thoughts like this?

855
01:12:13,330 --> 01:12:14,870
I used to lie there.

856
01:12:16,375 --> 01:12:20,165
I used to be empty,
and then you came along.

857
01:12:21,588 --> 01:12:23,918
And I don't want this anymore.

858
01:12:25,467 --> 01:12:28,797
Manny, please. I'm going to die.

859
01:12:28,887 --> 01:12:32,807
We're gonna die. That's a thought.

860
01:12:32,891 --> 01:12:35,561
Everybody dies.

861
01:12:35,644 --> 01:12:40,194
I'm sorry if this makes me weird
or you don't understand,

862
01:12:40,274 --> 01:12:42,484
but I wish I was dead again.

863
01:12:43,527 --> 01:12:44,777
No, Manny.

864
01:12:49,241 --> 01:12:51,201
I understand.

865
01:13:15,434 --> 01:13:18,190
So I guess you're gonna die now.

866
01:13:18,270 --> 01:13:20,980
It really feels like it's my fault.

867
01:13:21,065 --> 01:13:23,395
No, Manny. It's not your fault.

868
01:13:23,484 --> 01:13:26,154
I probably would have
done it myself eventually.

869
01:13:26,236 --> 01:13:30,866
God knows I've tried,
but there was always something there,

870
01:13:30,949 --> 01:13:36,409
some thought that was beautiful enough
to keep me going.

871
01:13:36,497 --> 01:13:40,127
Maybe that's just something the brain
invents to survive.

872
01:13:40,209 --> 01:13:44,589
Yeah. Like maybe your brain invented me
to distract you from the fact

873
01:13:44,671 --> 01:13:47,171
that eventually your eyes
are gonna stop blinking

874
01:13:47,257 --> 01:13:51,507
and your mouth will stop chewing
and your blood will stop pumping...

875
01:13:51,595 --> 01:13:53,755
and then you're gonna shit yourself.

876
01:13:53,847 --> 01:13:56,517
- And that's it.
- No.

877
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:59,020
No, that's not it.

878
01:13:59,103 --> 01:14:02,523
Because then my organs are
going to shit themselves.

879
01:14:02,606 --> 01:14:04,436
And then your cells will shit themselves,

880
01:14:04,525 --> 01:14:08,145
and then all your shit's gonna get mixed
in with everyone else's shit

881
01:14:08,237 --> 01:14:11,657
till there's nothing left of you,
and then that's it.

882
01:14:11,740 --> 01:14:13,030
I don't know, man.

883
01:14:13,117 --> 01:14:17,290
That sounds kind of nice,
everyone's shit mixing,

884
01:14:17,371 --> 01:14:19,621
because then someday some of your shit

885
01:14:19,706 --> 01:14:23,746
is gonna meet up with some of my shit,

886
01:14:23,836 --> 01:14:27,086
and we'll have something
to look forward to, you know?

887
01:14:27,172 --> 01:14:29,342
You're disgusting.

888
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:05,210
Manny.

889
01:16:14,446 --> 01:16:17,066
Manny, you idiot.

890
01:16:17,157 --> 01:16:19,077
You dumb idiot.

891
01:16:26,041 --> 01:16:27,421
Oh, you look like shit.

892
01:16:27,501 --> 01:16:31,341
Ah, yeah. Yeah. So do you.

893
01:16:32,965 --> 01:16:35,045
Thank you.

894
01:16:35,133 --> 01:16:36,593
Hey...

895
01:16:36,677 --> 01:16:38,097
Hank.

896
01:16:38,178 --> 01:16:40,508
Hank.

897
01:17:02,452 --> 01:17:05,292
Wow. There she is.

898
01:17:14,381 --> 01:17:16,091
Oh, shit.

899
01:17:16,174 --> 01:17:18,972
No, Manny, shh! Manny, stop singing!

900
01:17:19,052 --> 01:17:21,182
- Manny! No!
- Hank, what are you doing?

901
01:17:21,263 --> 01:17:22,601
- This is home.
- No!

902
01:17:22,681 --> 01:17:24,353
This is what we've been
fighting for, right?

903
01:17:24,433 --> 01:17:26,813
No! No. Oh, come on...

904
01:17:26,893 --> 01:17:28,982
- Manny, this is a bad idea!
- No, it's a great idea.

905
01:17:29,062 --> 01:17:32,822
Manny, let go of me!

906
01:17:34,651 --> 01:17:36,821
Maybe you could finally talk to her, Hank.

907
01:17:36,903 --> 01:17:40,243
You can finally show her all the things
we built for her and sing her the songs...

908
01:17:40,324 --> 01:17:43,038
Manny! Shut up! You don't
know the real world, Manny.

909
01:17:43,118 --> 01:17:44,957
What if they meet you and
they don't see what I see?

910
01:17:45,037 --> 01:17:46,617
What if they don't...

911
01:17:46,705 --> 01:17:48,825
That's stupid.

912
01:17:54,379 --> 01:17:58,929
From the first day we met,
you've been pushing me and poking me,

913
01:17:59,009 --> 01:18:01,259
making me spit, making me cry.

914
01:18:01,345 --> 01:18:03,055
Manny!

915
01:18:03,138 --> 01:18:05,468
How come I never get to see you do
any of those things?

916
01:18:05,557 --> 01:18:06,807
Because I'm scared.

917
01:18:06,892 --> 01:18:08,562
Okay?

918
01:18:08,685 --> 01:18:13,265
Because I'm just a scared,
ugly, useless person.

919
01:18:15,609 --> 01:18:18,069
But maybe everyone's a little bit ugly.

920
01:18:18,153 --> 01:18:21,410
Yeah, maybe we're all just ugly,
dying sacks of shit,

921
01:18:21,490 --> 01:18:25,038
and maybe all it'll take is one person
to just be okay with that,

922
01:18:25,118 --> 01:18:28,958
and then the whole world
will be dancing and singing and farting,

923
01:18:29,039 --> 01:18:32,379
and everyone will feel
a little bit less alone.

924
01:18:32,459 --> 01:18:35,339
Manny, you have no idea
how nice that sounds.

925
01:18:35,420 --> 01:18:36,710
Hello.

926
01:18:44,721 --> 01:18:47,521
Are you dressed up for Halloween?

927
01:18:48,892 --> 01:18:51,398
No. Uh...

928
01:18:51,478 --> 01:18:55,108
No, we're just a little dirty and tired.

929
01:18:55,190 --> 01:18:57,279
What's wrong with your face?

930
01:18:57,359 --> 01:19:00,239
Nothing. We just need some help.

931
01:19:03,031 --> 01:19:07,080
My name's Manny,
and this is my best friend Hank.

932
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:10,500
I used to be dead,
but then he brought me back to life,

933
01:19:10,580 --> 01:19:14,080
and we were lost out there in the woods
for a very long time,

934
01:19:14,167 --> 01:19:17,127
but we survived, because I have
special powers.

935
01:19:17,212 --> 01:19:19,422
Manny.

936
01:19:22,175 --> 01:19:24,215
Manny.

937
01:19:24,302 --> 01:19:25,972
- That's gross.
- No.

938
01:19:26,054 --> 01:19:28,854
No, it's not gross.

939
01:19:34,771 --> 01:19:35,981
God, no.

940
01:19:36,064 --> 01:19:37,361
Don't be afraid.

941
01:19:37,441 --> 01:19:38,904
Don't be afraid. It's okay.

942
01:19:38,984 --> 01:19:41,614
I'm scary, Hank. I guess I was wrong.

943
01:19:41,695 --> 01:19:43,235
I am weird.

944
01:19:43,321 --> 01:19:46,201
Manny, don't say that.
She just doesn't understand.

945
01:19:46,283 --> 01:19:48,493
Crissie?

946
01:19:51,538 --> 01:19:53,038
What is it?

947
01:20:00,172 --> 01:20:02,232
Crissie?

948
01:20:02,716 --> 01:20:03,966
Crissie, get inside.

949
01:20:06,970 --> 01:20:09,430
Who are you?
What are you doing in my backyard?

950
01:20:14,436 --> 01:20:17,396
He's Manny. He used to be dead.

951
01:20:17,481 --> 01:20:19,861
Crissie, let Mommy talk, okay?

952
01:20:19,941 --> 01:20:22,030
He was lost in the woods. He needs help.

953
01:20:22,110 --> 01:20:23,360
What?

954
01:20:24,821 --> 01:20:26,531
Is that true?

955
01:20:29,493 --> 01:20:31,663
You okay?

956
01:20:39,669 --> 01:20:42,259
Just wait here.

957
01:20:49,888 --> 01:20:53,388
Hey. Hey.

958
01:20:53,475 --> 01:20:56,015
See that? That wasn't so bad.

959
01:20:56,102 --> 01:20:59,109
Did you see the way she looked at me?

960
01:20:59,189 --> 01:21:00,819
I'm not very good at this.

961
01:21:00,899 --> 01:21:05,529
No. No, hey, bud,
you're the best at this. Okay?

962
01:21:05,612 --> 01:21:07,162
I'm sorry, Hank.

963
01:21:09,491 --> 01:21:12,371
Hey, Manny. Manny, don't be stupid.

964
01:21:12,452 --> 01:21:17,292
Please don't tell Sarah
how much I loved her.

965
01:21:19,084 --> 01:21:20,344
Manny.

966
01:21:21,419 --> 01:21:23,549
Manny.

967
01:21:23,630 --> 01:21:25,050
Hey.

968
01:21:25,131 --> 01:21:27,429
Hey. Manny.

969
01:21:27,509 --> 01:21:30,679
Manny. Manny.

970
01:21:30,762 --> 01:21:32,892
Manny.

971
01:21:32,973 --> 01:21:36,183
Here. Come sit down, okay?

972
01:21:36,268 --> 01:21:37,558
I called for help.

973
01:21:42,023 --> 01:21:43,443
Come on.

974
01:22:14,556 --> 01:22:16,886
This is some fucked-up shit.

975
01:22:16,975 --> 01:22:19,345
You really think he just found the body?

976
01:22:19,436 --> 01:22:21,726
The abrasions seem to have
happened postmortem,

977
01:22:21,813 --> 01:22:27,489
and discoloration on the abdomen
tells me he's probably a bridge jumper.

978
01:22:27,569 --> 01:22:29,783
We find their bodies washed up
on the beach all the time.

979
01:22:29,863 --> 01:22:32,493
That must be where he found him,
so actually checks out.

980
01:22:32,574 --> 01:22:34,329
What do they do with him now?

981
01:22:34,409 --> 01:22:35,747
He'll spend two weeks in the morgue

982
01:22:35,827 --> 01:22:37,947
while they try to figure out
who the hell he is,

983
01:22:38,038 --> 01:22:40,958
and when nobody comes to claim
the body, because nobody ever does,

984
01:22:41,041 --> 01:22:43,129
the county can pay for a funeral
no one'll show up to,

985
01:22:43,209 --> 01:22:45,757
because obviously no one cared
about this son of a bitch to begin with.

986
01:22:45,837 --> 01:22:47,877
Hey.

987
01:22:47,964 --> 01:22:49,634
Yeah?

988
01:22:49,716 --> 01:22:50,971
- Don't I know you?
- Hey.

989
01:22:51,051 --> 01:22:52,841
- Manny, there you are.
- You look familiar.

990
01:22:52,969 --> 01:22:55,259
Are you ready? We are going live
in five minutes.

991
01:22:55,347 --> 01:22:57,887
Right this way. Turn around.
Right this way.

992
01:22:57,974 --> 01:22:59,229
It's all so exciting, isn't it?

993
01:22:59,309 --> 01:23:01,606
- They're gonna love your story.
- Find anything on the cell phone?

994
01:23:01,686 --> 01:23:03,226
They're checking it out right now.

995
01:23:03,313 --> 01:23:06,152
- There she is.
- That's the phone?

996
01:23:06,232 --> 01:23:08,072
Stand right here. Don't go anywhere.

997
01:23:15,742 --> 01:23:17,122
It's all right.

998
01:23:17,202 --> 01:23:19,249
- You the father?
- Yes.

999
01:23:19,329 --> 01:23:22,617
We found your number in this phone,
and there's no I.D. on the body,

1000
01:23:22,707 --> 01:23:25,417
so we just need somebody
to identify the body.

1001
01:23:34,927 --> 01:23:36,967
Ready?

1002
01:23:37,055 --> 01:23:39,095
No. No.

1003
01:23:39,182 --> 01:23:40,642
I'm sorry.

1004
01:24:12,674 --> 01:24:15,844
I just wanted to check in, make sure
you're okay. You all right?

1005
01:24:15,927 --> 01:24:17,887
This must all be really
overwhelming for you,

1006
01:24:17,971 --> 01:24:21,019
so just let me know if you need
anything, okay?

1007
01:24:21,099 --> 01:24:23,688
Excuse me. Ma'am, I have something
I need to show you.

1008
01:24:23,768 --> 01:24:25,518
Can you come with me?

1009
01:24:25,603 --> 01:24:27,273
Good luck on your interview.

1010
01:24:27,355 --> 01:24:31,525
So they found this phone on the body,
and there are these images.

1011
01:24:31,609 --> 01:24:33,569
Manny? Manny, there you are.

1012
01:24:33,653 --> 01:24:34,903
- Do you know...
- This is...

1013
01:24:34,988 --> 01:24:36,451
We're going live in just a few seconds.

1014
01:24:36,531 --> 01:24:37,951
- Right this way.
- Keep swiping.

1015
01:24:38,074 --> 01:24:39,454
And turn around. Here's the camera.

1016
01:24:39,534 --> 01:24:40,954
Do not go anywhere.

1017
01:24:41,077 --> 01:24:43,457
- You don't know this young man?
- No, I don't.

1018
01:24:43,538 --> 01:24:45,618
Look right into it.
Your friends are gonna see you.

1019
01:24:45,707 --> 01:24:49,087
Five, four, three, two...

1020
01:24:50,628 --> 01:24:54,052
Thanks, Jonathan. We're here live with
the man who we know simply as Manny...

1021
01:24:54,132 --> 01:24:56,680
- Hey! What are you doing, son?
- ...a man who stumbled into the backyard

1022
01:24:56,760 --> 01:24:59,470
- of a local Eastborough home...
- I'm not Manny.

1023
01:24:59,554 --> 01:25:00,814
And your name?

1024
01:25:02,223 --> 01:25:05,480
- My name is Hank Thompson.
- We're here with Hank Thompson...

1025
01:25:05,560 --> 01:25:07,649
And that's Manny.

1026
01:25:07,729 --> 01:25:12,984
He saved my life with his amazing body,
and he has these powers,

1027
01:25:13,109 --> 01:25:16,989
and they're the only reason
that I'm standing here today,

1028
01:25:17,113 --> 01:25:19,703
- and I will not let them take him away.
- Okay.

1029
01:25:22,660 --> 01:25:24,370
Wait. What's going on?

1030
01:25:24,454 --> 01:25:27,124
This is... This is your phone?
Why... Why am I in your phone?

1031
01:25:27,207 --> 01:25:28,827
I'm sorry.

1032
01:25:28,917 --> 01:25:33,457
You just seemed really happy,
and I wasn't.

1033
01:25:33,546 --> 01:25:35,716
What the fuck?

1034
01:25:35,799 --> 01:25:37,049
Hey, buddy.

1035
01:25:37,133 --> 01:25:39,639
Hank, what are you trying to do to me?
What would your mother think?

1036
01:25:39,719 --> 01:25:41,639
I think she'd be happy somebody loves me.

1037
01:25:41,721 --> 01:25:44,221
Hank. Hank! That's a dead body.

1038
01:25:44,307 --> 01:25:48,437
- What are you, retarded?
- Dad, don't say that word.

1039
01:25:54,859 --> 01:25:57,859
No! Manny!

1040
01:25:57,946 --> 01:25:59,776
Manny, where are you?

1041
01:26:00,824 --> 01:26:02,871
Crissie? Crissie!

1042
01:26:02,951 --> 01:26:04,491
Crissie!

1043
01:26:06,037 --> 01:26:07,997
- Sorry, bud.
- Sir!

1044
01:26:10,458 --> 01:26:12,088
Sir! Stop!

1045
01:26:12,168 --> 01:26:13,668
- Hank!
- Crissie!

1046
01:26:13,753 --> 01:26:15,633
Crissie, come out right now!

1047
01:26:18,424 --> 01:26:20,013
Sir, where are you going?

1048
01:26:20,093 --> 01:26:21,433
I got you.

1049
01:26:23,096 --> 01:26:25,096
Come on. Stay with me.

1050
01:26:25,181 --> 01:26:27,228
I won't let them take you away.

1051
01:26:27,308 --> 01:26:32,650
I won't let them take you to some morgue
and bury you in some unmarked grave.

1052
01:26:32,730 --> 01:26:35,940
Please, I just need you to wake up!

1053
01:26:36,943 --> 01:26:38,193
Hank!

1054
01:26:38,278 --> 01:26:40,698
- Crissie!
- Crissie!

1055
01:26:40,780 --> 01:26:42,070
Hank, where are you?

1056
01:26:44,659 --> 01:26:47,289
Sir, stop!

1057
01:26:47,370 --> 01:26:49,750
Sir, you've gotta get out of the river.

1058
01:26:53,042 --> 01:26:54,502
What is this?

1059
01:26:58,798 --> 01:27:01,218
Oh, fuck. They're gonna see everything.

1060
01:27:02,719 --> 01:27:04,509
Crissie!

1061
01:27:39,047 --> 01:27:41,417
I really screwed you up, didn't I?

1062
01:27:41,507 --> 01:27:43,837
I'm sorry.

1063
01:27:43,927 --> 01:27:48,809
I just wanted to give you all the things
in life that everyone else gets to have

1064
01:27:48,890 --> 01:27:54,060
and all the things I thought
I didn't deserve to have till I met you.

1065
01:27:55,521 --> 01:27:57,771
And they might laugh at us.

1066
01:27:57,857 --> 01:28:00,067
They might call us names,

1067
01:28:00,151 --> 01:28:04,111
and they might think we're weird,
but it doesn't matter what they think.

1068
01:28:04,197 --> 01:28:06,867
Just please...

1069
01:28:06,950 --> 01:28:08,910
don't die.

1070
01:28:10,286 --> 01:28:12,156
Hey.

1071
01:28:15,291 --> 01:28:17,381
You made all that?

1072
01:28:19,587 --> 01:28:21,127
Yes.

1073
01:28:23,174 --> 01:28:24,971
Yes.

1074
01:28:25,051 --> 01:28:26,721
We did it...

1075
01:28:26,803 --> 01:28:28,183
together.

1076
01:28:29,222 --> 01:28:31,682
And we sang, and we danced...

1077
01:28:31,766 --> 01:28:33,016
Oh, my God.

1078
01:28:33,101 --> 01:28:35,021
...and it was beautiful.

1079
01:28:37,188 --> 01:28:38,978
I wish you all could have been there.

1080
01:28:40,149 --> 01:28:43,069
I wish you all could have seen it.

1081
01:28:45,822 --> 01:28:48,202
We just have to show them.

1082
01:29:12,849 --> 01:29:14,179
What the fuck?

1083
01:29:15,977 --> 01:29:17,227
Wait.

1084
01:29:17,353 --> 01:29:19,403
Oh, Jesus.

1085
01:29:26,738 --> 01:29:28,568
It was me.

1086
01:29:30,283 --> 01:29:31,533
I did it.

1087
01:29:39,208 --> 01:29:41,248
All right, let's go.

1088
01:29:41,377 --> 01:29:43,297
Manny.

1089
01:29:43,379 --> 01:29:44,839
Come on.

1090
01:29:48,009 --> 01:29:50,049
Manny.

1091
01:30:00,396 --> 01:30:02,606
Come on.

1092
01:30:04,317 --> 01:30:06,397
All right, man, that's enough, okay?

1093
01:30:06,486 --> 01:30:08,906
- That wasn't me.
- What?

1094
01:31:23,271 --> 01:31:25,151
What the fuck?

1095
01:32:00,516 --> 01:32:04,476
# Restless #

1096
01:32:04,562 --> 01:32:10,112
# Walking 'round restless #

1097
01:32:10,193 --> 01:32:15,363
# It's such a good night, man #

1098
01:32:15,448 --> 01:32:19,198
# For being alone #

1099
01:32:22,538 --> 01:32:25,708
# Interest #

1100
01:32:25,791 --> 01:32:31,921
# Nothing but interest #

1101
01:32:32,006 --> 01:32:36,006
# I think I lost it #

1102
01:32:37,386 --> 01:32:40,846
# Forever ago #

1103
01:32:43,476 --> 01:32:46,306
# Is there any way #

1104
01:32:46,395 --> 01:32:49,855
# To get out of here? #

1105
01:32:49,941 --> 01:32:53,401
# Out there #

1106
01:32:53,486 --> 01:32:58,736
# Further than distance #

1107
01:32:58,824 --> 01:33:04,124
# There is an instance #

1108
01:33:04,205 --> 01:33:08,035
# Searching for home #

1109
01:33:11,045 --> 01:33:14,755
# I'll try #

1110
01:33:14,840 --> 01:33:19,220
# Try to believe it #

1111
01:33:20,221 --> 01:33:25,521
# Try to conceive it #

1112
01:33:25,601 --> 01:33:29,611
# By using your bone #

1113
01:33:31,816 --> 01:33:38,486
# There's gotta be a way
to get out of here #

1114
01:33:38,614 --> 01:33:41,744
# Restless #

1115
01:33:41,826 --> 01:33:46,286
# How are you breathless? #

1116
01:33:47,373 --> 01:33:52,548
# Tired, but restless #

1117
01:33:52,628 --> 01:33:56,418
# The lacking of tone #

1118
01:33:59,427 --> 01:34:03,217
# Heartless #

1119
01:34:03,306 --> 01:34:07,726
# How were you heartless? #

1120
01:34:09,061 --> 01:34:13,861
# I see your sadness #

1121
01:34:13,941 --> 01:34:17,651
# And make it my own #

1122
01:34:20,156 --> 01:34:22,986
# There's gotta be a better way #

1123
01:34:23,075 --> 01:34:27,245
# To get out of here. #

1124
01:35:31,352 --> 01:35:35,232
# Where did you come from? #

1125
01:35:35,314 --> 01:35:36,902
# Where did you go? #

1126
01:35:36,982 --> 01:35:38,652
# Where did you go? #

1127
01:35:38,734 --> 01:35:41,282
# Where did you come from? #

1128
01:35:41,362 --> 01:35:44,282
# Where did you go? #

1129
01:35:44,365 --> 01:35:47,655
# Where did you come from? #

1130
01:35:47,743 --> 01:35:50,413
