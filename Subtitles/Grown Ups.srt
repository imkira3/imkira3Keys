2
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,394
Double dribble.

3
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:09,263
Why, because I'm black?

4
00:01:09,437 --> 00:01:11,337
Yeah, that's what I thought.

5
00:01:33,127 --> 00:01:34,424
<i>Me?</i>

6
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:36,187
Ten seconds left.
We need a basket.

7
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:39,957
Play one. Play one.

8
00:01:40,935 --> 00:01:42,459
Kurt, Kurt, Kurt. Here.

9
00:01:42,636 --> 00:01:44,263
Get in.

10
00:01:46,173 --> 00:01:47,333
Bring it in!

11
00:01:47,508 --> 00:01:49,999
Bank's open, Lenny.

12
00:01:50,177 --> 00:01:51,508
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13
00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:53,112
Yeah.

14
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,975
Bank's open.

15
00:01:55,149 --> 00:01:57,481
His foot was on the line.

16
00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:08,461
First off, I'd like to thank
the Earnshaw family...

17
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:12,224
...for lending us their beautiful lake
house to help us celebrate our victory.

18
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:14,333
Yeah, the Ferdinando Five.

19
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:17,664
They're dynamite.

20
00:02:17,838 --> 00:02:18,998
You're drunk, Dad.

21
00:02:19,173 --> 00:02:21,198
Yeah.

22
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:25,573
Hey. We're here to celebrate
the kids' shots, not your shots.

23
00:02:27,348 --> 00:02:31,182
Anyway, I wanna talk about
what you kids did this afternoon.

24
00:02:31,352 --> 00:02:35,550
You know, you played the game
just like I always ask you to.

25
00:02:35,723 --> 00:02:38,419
You left everything you had
out there on that court.

26
00:02:38,993 --> 00:02:41,757
So that when the final buzzer
went off...

27
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,395
...you were champions.

28
00:02:44,565 --> 00:02:46,692
Now, I want you
to promise me something.

29
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:50,598
I want you to play life
just like you played that game today.

30
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:54,435
So when that final buzzer of life
goes off...

31
00:02:58,245 --> 00:02:59,837
...you'll have no regrets.

32
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:01,575
Here's to coach.

33
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:12,017
You're my first champions.
My first champions.

34
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,216
Stick together.

35
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:16,128
<i>- Time to die.
- No.</i>

36
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:20,124
<i>Murder.</i>

37
00:03:20,301 --> 00:03:23,896
I am the biggest agent in Hollywood
and you just pissed me off.

38
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:26,403
And now I'll pull Brad Pitt
from your movie.

39
00:03:26,574 --> 00:03:30,010
I'll pull Julia Roberts from your movie.
I don't care, Sandy.

40
00:03:30,177 --> 00:03:32,304
That's right, you better back down.

41
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:33,904
Thank you.

42
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:36,481
Have a good Fourth of July.
All right, love you too.

43
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,880
What's up, boys? Hey.

44
00:03:39,353 --> 00:03:41,150
Greggie, Keithie.

45
00:03:43,424 --> 00:03:46,484
You guys ever hear of a game called
Chutes and Ladders?

46
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,718
Pretty awesome game.

47
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:49,522
I used to play it when I was a kid.

48
00:03:49,697 --> 00:03:52,598
Okay, what it is,
is they give you a spinner.

49
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:56,099
And you spin. If you land on a ladder,
you get to climb up the ladder.

50
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:59,671
If you land on a chute, you slide down
the chute and start over again.

51
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,775
Yeah, and what happens?
The winner gets a training bra?

52
00:04:02,943 --> 00:04:05,343
Yeah, Dad,
that game sounds like it sucks.

53
00:04:05,512 --> 00:04:07,503
I'm telling you,
this was the greatest game.

54
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:09,239
Me and my buddies would play it.

55
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,782
We'd go down in the basement,
drink hot chocolate.

56
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:13,852
I wouldn't mind
a hot chocolate right now.

57
00:04:14,255 --> 00:04:16,314
Hey, Rita.

58
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,014
Rita.

59
00:04:18,192 --> 00:04:20,683
Dude, you gotta text her.
She's doing laundry.

60
00:04:21,462 --> 00:04:24,124
Hey, Dad, we were at
the Spielbergs' house yesterday.

61
00:04:24,298 --> 00:04:27,324
They have a 150-inch TV.
Can we get one of those?

62
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:30,061
<i>When you direct E. T.
I'll get you one of those.</i>

63
00:04:30,237 --> 00:04:33,172
<i>- Beg for mercy.
- What is the object here? I don't get it.</i>

64
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:37,436
You're on a cruise ship and you chop
people's heads off with a chain saw?

65
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:39,306
Oh, and you can drown them.

66
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,311
Oh, you can drown them.
Now I get it.

67
00:04:42,116 --> 00:04:43,140
<i>Granny overboard.</i>

68
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:46,452
Can somebody answer the phone?

69
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,616
Maybe I should get some chamomile
for my throat too.

70
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,315
Stop texting the nanny.
You know how gross that is...

71
00:04:52,493 --> 00:04:55,121
...for a kid to text his nanny?
Just go down the hallway.

72
00:04:55,296 --> 00:04:56,661
Why? You text everybody.

73
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:00,823
I text people for my job so I can make
money to pay for your texting.

74
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:04,664
- Okay, I got everything for you, boys.
- Who was that on the phone, Rita?

75
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:07,864
I'm sorry, Mr. Feder, I don't know.
Becky answered.

76
00:05:08,042 --> 00:05:10,909
- Okay, okay. Thanks for making that.
- Oh, my God, Rita.

77
00:05:11,078 --> 00:05:13,706
This isn't Godiva. What are you,
trying to poison me?

78
00:05:14,515 --> 00:05:15,914
Good Lord, go back to texting.

79
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:18,711
I don't ever wanna hear that
out loud again.

80
00:05:20,454 --> 00:05:22,820
What the heck's going on out here?

81
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:26,385
Oh, my God.

82
00:05:28,462 --> 00:05:30,191
I didn't mean to. It was an accident.

83
00:05:30,364 --> 00:05:33,231
I don't care. Are you all right?
What the heck were you doing?

84
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,493
I was trying to use the Navy.

85
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:37,034
The Navy? What's the Navy?

86
00:05:37,204 --> 00:05:39,672
The Navy in the car
to ask it a question.

87
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,502
You mean
the navigation system, idiot.

88
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,507
- Keithie, relax.
- Some man called.

89
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:47,943
He said your friend, Coach Buzzer,
went to heaven.

90
00:05:48,115 --> 00:05:51,312
I was trying to find heaven for you
on the Navy station...

91
00:05:51,485 --> 00:05:53,112
...so you could go visit him.

92
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:00,554
Who's your friend, Dad?

93
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:06,193
Coach Buzzer was someone
very special in Daddy's life.

94
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:08,426
It's terrible.

95
00:06:08,602 --> 00:06:11,332
Okay, go drink some hot chocolate
with these guys.

96
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:12,840
You sure you're okay?

97
00:06:16,143 --> 00:06:18,043
Okay, sweetie.

98
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:19,611
You're splashing your brother.

99
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,044
Eric, hon? It's your mom.

100
00:06:28,622 --> 00:06:31,648
Oh, my God. Eric.
Are you all right?

101
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:33,824
Donna.

102
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:37,622
Oh, my God, Bean.
Bean, stay on the duck.

103
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:40,266
Stay on the duck.
What is happening?

104
00:06:40,434 --> 00:06:42,459
Oh, hon.

105
00:06:42,803 --> 00:06:43,827
Hello, Mommy.

106
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:45,228
- Hey.
- Hey, Mom.

107
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:46,430
Hi, Mom.

108
00:06:46,607 --> 00:06:48,734
Well, I'll see you there. All right.

109
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,103
Hey, is something wrong?

110
00:06:50,277 --> 00:06:52,973
Yeah, it'll be all right.
I'll talk to you about it later.

111
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:54,809
Hey, hey.

112
00:06:54,982 --> 00:06:56,847
I made the pumpkin risotto
that we saw...

113
00:06:57,017 --> 00:06:59,247
...on Rachael Ray's
"Seasons of Summer" special.

114
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,786
- It's awful, Mom.
- It tastes like roadkill.

115
00:07:01,955 --> 00:07:04,651
Deanne, do you hear how they talk
to me? Do you hear how...?

116
00:07:04,825 --> 00:07:05,917
You gotta say something.

117
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:09,085
All right, kids. Now, you know
your father works very hard...

118
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:12,630
...at keeping this house clean
and putting meals on the table for us.

119
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,267
Hello?

120
00:07:14,435 --> 00:07:16,369
Besides...

121
00:07:16,837 --> 00:07:20,102
...I brought us a pizza.

122
00:07:20,574 --> 00:07:23,134
You know what? Fine.

123
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,244
Have your pizza. Have your pizza.

124
00:07:25,412 --> 00:07:26,606
You broke my heart.

125
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,805
You broke my heart.

126
00:07:30,217 --> 00:07:33,152
Looks like
it's his time of the month again.

127
00:07:34,388 --> 00:07:36,754
God, that's rough, buddy.

128
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,816
Who's making
the funeral arrangements?

129
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:43,520
Oh, his niece?
She must be devastated.

130
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:45,790
Hey, is she still hot, do you know?

131
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:48,230
Don't make me lose my temper,
Marcus.

132
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:52,571
What?

133
00:07:53,941 --> 00:07:57,377
Hey, if I don't make it
to the funeral...

134
00:07:57,611 --> 00:08:01,342
...tell the police it was Arlene
from Applebee's.

135
00:08:02,049 --> 00:08:03,846
No, thanks for calling me.

136
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:05,746
And I'll see you there.

137
00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:08,145
Bye.

138
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,449
The coach is dead.

139
00:08:14,962 --> 00:08:17,226
His funeral is this Friday.

140
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:21,960
I don't think I can handle this alone.

141
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:23,702
Can you come with me?

142
00:08:24,638 --> 00:08:26,299
Of course.

143
00:08:26,473 --> 00:08:29,499
I'll postpone my cataract surgery.

144
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,906
You are my special lady.

145
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:37,179
Now I'm gonna transport you
to a world of serene relaxation.

146
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:58,596
Okay, guys,
let's try to act normal in there.

147
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:00,364
What's wrong
with your sunglasses?

148
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,634
I don't want any reason
for these guys to call me...

149
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:04,640
Hollywood!

150
00:09:05,445 --> 00:09:08,539
- Hey. Look at that. Kurt McKenzie.
- Hey.

151
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:11,309
- And the whole McKenzie clan.
- Come here, man.

152
00:09:11,485 --> 00:09:13,350
- Deanne, you look great.
- I do?

153
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,148
My wife's over there.
Go and say hi. Children.

154
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:18,382
I see that ass is still growing.

155
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:20,925
Got a little Kardashian in there.

156
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:25,690
Well, you've kind of turned into a little
Michael Vick thing, if he was bulimic.

157
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,394
Hi, Roxanne.

158
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:31,094
I don't know if you remember me.
I was at your wedding.

159
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:34,536
I was the one that was table dancing
all night. Deanne McKenzie.

160
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:35,902
Of course.

161
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,601
- Deanne, hello.
- Hi, good to see you.

162
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:40,144
Oh, my God, you're glowing.

163
00:09:40,347 --> 00:09:43,441
You look so beautiful
with your pregnancy.

164
00:09:44,451 --> 00:09:46,783
What the hell are you talking about?

165
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:52,090
I'm just playing.

166
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:55,660
Oh, my God. You should see
your face. You were like, "Huh?"

167
00:09:56,496 --> 00:09:58,589
Little Lenny Feder.

168
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:00,164
Mama Ronzoni got big, huh?

169
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:02,733
Look at this handsome hunk
of prosciutto.

170
00:10:02,903 --> 00:10:05,269
And such a big success.

171
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,669
Come on, give Mama a kiss.

172
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:12,073
Can I get a...?
Can I get a cheek at all?

173
00:10:12,245 --> 00:10:16,409
I got you, I got you. Poked in the eye
by the hat, but I'm all right.

174
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:20,709
How about your son-in-law here,
I hear he's a house husband now.

175
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:23,754
My daughter's gotta bust her hump
all day to pay the bills...

176
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:26,051
...while dummy here stays home
and cleans.

177
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:28,490
I don't know how you could
talk to me like that...

178
00:10:28,662 --> 00:10:31,631
...when you look like Idi Amin
with a propeller on your head.

179
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:34,460
- That's nice that he could...
- Roxanne, this is my mother.

180
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:39,163
Hello, Mama Ronzoni, I'm so pleased
to meet you. I'm Little Lenny's wife.

181
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:43,173
What a spicy quesadilla
you got yourself, Lenny.

182
00:10:43,343 --> 00:10:45,402
Yeah, she tastes great.

183
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:47,738
I bet.

184
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:53,185
Didn't I tell you
to turn the phone off there, Greg?

185
00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:55,048
Yeah, but it's my massage therapist.

186
00:10:55,222 --> 00:10:57,486
What? No, no. No cell phones.

187
00:10:57,658 --> 00:10:59,319
No cell phones?
Then I'm out of here.

188
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:00,818
Higgie.

189
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,656
Who's ready to get their funeral on?

190
00:11:04,965 --> 00:11:06,728
I'm sorry, death makes me weird.

191
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,367
What's up, McKenzie?

192
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:10,765
You got those soft hands.
Still using Palmolive?

193
00:11:10,937 --> 00:11:12,199
Hey, what's up, Lenny?

194
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:14,636
Buddy, I thought you were gonna start
working out.

195
00:11:14,808 --> 00:11:16,935
- What does that mean?
- You're fat.

196
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,202
No. No.

197
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:21,279
Hey, guys, this is good news.
I always wanted to represent you.

198
00:11:21,448 --> 00:11:23,279
You're the third Olsen twin?

199
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:25,509
Keep it down.
Hey, so these are your kids?

200
00:11:26,453 --> 00:11:28,614
And who's that girl?
That's not a nanny, is it?

201
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:32,885
No, no, this is a friend of ours
from China.

202
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,960
Oh, yeah.
No, I've been on that website.

203
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:36,152
No, no, no.

204
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:40,925
Like an exchange student that...
My wife brought her into the house.

205
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:43,467
Oh, your wife's into chicks.
Oh, that's nice.

206
00:11:43,637 --> 00:11:45,468
Hollywood. See, he always lucks out.

207
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:47,937
- Just an exchange student.
- I always thought...

208
00:11:48,108 --> 00:11:49,541
Hey, now.

209
00:11:50,177 --> 00:11:53,544
Lamonsoff. Rolling up in a Caddy?

210
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:54,738
That's how we do it.

211
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:58,282
And you, you've grown up
on me, man. Are you a B-cup now?

212
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:02,954
Hey, nice ears.
You get the NFL package on those?

213
00:12:04,524 --> 00:12:07,084
Nice Caddy.
You selling lawn furniture and crack?

214
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:10,093
Come on, I'm the co-owner
of Branchville Lawn Furniture, man.

215
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:11,560
I'm the boss now, baby.

216
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:12,926
Oh, good for you, Eric.

217
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,591
- Glad you brought your mother.
- Oh, that's a good one.

218
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:19,136
It's like shaking hands with an Eagle.
I'll see you later.

219
00:12:21,608 --> 00:12:25,135
<i>Oh, my God. It's Captain Caring
of the SS Melodrama.</i>

220
00:12:25,312 --> 00:12:27,303
Oh, he's gonna play this one big.

221
00:12:27,481 --> 00:12:28,971
Cue "Hey."

222
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:30,508
Hey.

223
00:12:30,684 --> 00:12:32,117
Hey.

224
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:34,845
- Hell of a circumstance, huh?
- I know, I know. It sucks.

225
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:36,045
Great to see you.

226
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:38,783
Well, the Buzzer's up there
coaching heaven's team now.

227
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,986
- That's true.
- He's got Wilt, Pistol Pete, Dr. J.

228
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:45,427
Yeah, Dr. J's alive still.

229
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:48,197
- Well, those type of guys.
- Yeah, yeah.

230
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:49,630
You look good, though, man.

231
00:12:49,803 --> 00:12:52,533
It's like if Elvis
was an Oompa Loompa...

232
00:12:52,706 --> 00:12:54,401
...he's right in front of me.

233
00:12:54,574 --> 00:12:57,634
Well, I don't make jokes at funerals
because it's disrespectful.

234
00:12:57,811 --> 00:13:00,746
But if that's part of
your healing process, I'm cool with it.

235
00:13:00,914 --> 00:13:02,279
That's nice. Thanks.

236
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:04,383
Are you cool with a finger in you?

237
00:13:05,986 --> 00:13:08,614
Hey, Roxanne.

238
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:12,088
Remember Rob,
the guy I always tell you about? Rob?

239
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:13,419
Of course.

240
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:17,051
The kid who didn't hit puberty
till he was 19, right?

241
00:13:17,998 --> 00:13:20,159
That was our secret.

242
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,631
And this must be your mother.

243
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:24,160
My wife.

244
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:25,997
I'm sorry.

245
00:13:26,173 --> 00:13:28,300
Hi. I'm Gloria.

246
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:31,808
Oh, it's so nice to meet you.
Your design line is so beautiful.

247
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:34,844
Oh, thank you, thank you.

248
00:13:35,015 --> 00:13:37,074
- And I love your scarves.
- Thank you.

249
00:13:37,851 --> 00:13:40,479
She'll be tying me up
with those later.

250
00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:44,214
He's not kidding.

251
00:13:45,926 --> 00:13:47,860
Oh, grody.

252
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:51,486
Oh, those are long, long tongues.

253
00:13:54,034 --> 00:13:57,128
We'll see you in there.
See you in there.

254
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,705
Hi, guys. Right over there? Yep.

255
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:04,844
Sit right here, sit right here.
I'm gonna go say hi to Lenny.

256
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:07,172
- No, honey.
- Oh, hi. Lenny.

257
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:08,939
How you doing?

258
00:14:09,115 --> 00:14:11,345
I heard through a little bird...

259
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:14,544
...that you guys rented
the Earnshaw lake house for us...

260
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:15,915
...for the entire weekend.

261
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:17,818
That's like a dream come true
for us.

262
00:14:17,991 --> 00:14:20,016
We had to rent it
for the whole weekend be...

263
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:23,094
We don't get to stay the whole
weekend. We have to go to Milan.

264
00:14:23,263 --> 00:14:25,060
For Roxanne's fashion show.

265
00:14:25,232 --> 00:14:26,699
Oh, my God, that's a shame.

266
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:29,097
Oh, but you're gonna have
so much fun in Milan.

267
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:32,238
You know, J Lo and Marc Anthony
vacationed there last year.

268
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:35,568
It's up the street from Lake Como,
where George Clooney has a villa.

269
00:14:35,742 --> 00:14:37,642
I read too many of those magazines.

270
00:14:37,811 --> 00:14:39,142
- No.
- Come on. I'm sorry.

271
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:41,439
- He hates when I talk about this.
- We'll just...

272
00:14:41,615 --> 00:14:43,879
We are backing away.
Ashamed, right?

273
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,814
Oh, and Tom Cruise
got married there too.

274
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,151
- Thanks for letting me know.
- What?

275
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:52,450
Well, I don't understand why you had
to rent it for a whole weekend.

276
00:14:52,626 --> 00:14:56,153
Because it's a holiday.
They won't rent it to you for one night.

277
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:59,628
So your friends are partying all
weekend while you're stuck in Milan.

278
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:01,096
- Yeah.
- That was nice of you.

279
00:15:01,268 --> 00:15:03,532
It was nice of us.
It's your money too, isn't it?

280
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:06,570
Yeah, it's your money, it's his money,
it's my money.

281
00:15:06,773 --> 00:15:09,173
Let's put all our cash in a pile
and split it.

282
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:11,867
That's a nice hat,
it brings out the death in the room.

283
00:15:12,045 --> 00:15:15,310
I'm sorry, I'm nervous.
And it's a funeral, I get weird.

284
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:21,520
There he is, Joe Hollywood.

285
00:15:21,688 --> 00:15:23,781
Mr. Big Shot Agent.

286
00:15:23,957 --> 00:15:26,892
You think he represents
Hulk Hogan?

287
00:15:27,193 --> 00:15:29,093
No way.

288
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:32,053
Then he ain't that big, is he?

289
00:15:32,832 --> 00:15:36,859
By the way, if anyone asks,
Rita is an exchange student.

290
00:15:40,707 --> 00:15:42,504
Andre.

291
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:46,111
I think I just sat
on your adding machine.

292
00:15:46,713 --> 00:15:49,682
Now I know what happened
to the fish tank.

293
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:53,281
Coach Robert "The Buzzer"
Ferdinando...

294
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,387
...was a caretaker by profession.

295
00:15:55,555 --> 00:16:00,015
What a wonderful word to describe
his devotion to his fellow man.

296
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:02,627
He truly took care.

297
00:16:03,263 --> 00:16:05,322
When Robert knew
that his time was short...

298
00:16:05,498 --> 00:16:08,023
...he told me there was
one specific man he wanted...

299
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:10,465
...to say a few words
to memorialize him.

300
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:14,038
So I'd like to ask Lenny Feder
to come up now.

301
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:24,712
I'm sorry, I'm not prepared at all.

302
00:16:24,884 --> 00:16:27,284
I feel very honored...

303
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:30,313
...that coach asked me
to do this, but...

304
00:16:31,725 --> 00:16:36,458
I also feel terrible because
I haven't seen the coach in so long.

305
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:40,087
And he always wanted me to come
to town and see him...

306
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:44,100
...and I got caught up
in what I've been doing and I regret it.

307
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:47,931
I understand that the St. Mark's team
of 1978...

308
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:52,044
...was the only championship team
that the coach ever had...

309
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,747
...and that's very impressive,
I gotta say...

310
00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:58,611
...judging from the talent
we had to offer.

311
00:16:58,785 --> 00:17:00,616
I mean, believe it or not...

312
00:17:00,787 --> 00:17:05,281
...Robbie and Marcus were actually
shorter back in 1978.

313
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:08,352
But those guys had a skill
you never mastered.

314
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,723
They knew how to pass the ball.

315
00:17:11,598 --> 00:17:15,864
Looks like somebody has to learn how
to pass the Kentucky Fried Chicken.

316
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:18,902
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

317
00:17:19,072 --> 00:17:22,303
We're saying goodbye to a big part
of our lives. All of us.

318
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:26,605
You affected everybody in this room.

319
00:17:28,148 --> 00:17:31,311
And I hope we get
to live our lives like you.

320
00:17:31,951 --> 00:17:37,787
Have no regrets
when life's final buzzer sounds.

321
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:40,990
So let's all bow our heads in silence.

322
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:57,475
They should have just ended it
right after you.

323
00:17:57,644 --> 00:17:59,305
This is insanity.

324
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:00,707
Yeah.

325
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:04,642
Five bucks it takes him down
on one knee.

326
00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:06,575
You're on.

327
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:15,755
<i>Stop it.</i>

328
00:18:52,899 --> 00:18:54,059
Grow up, will you?

329
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:55,633
Oh, look at him now.

330
00:18:56,436 --> 00:18:59,337
Don't get so mad there, Robbie.

331
00:19:01,241 --> 00:19:04,142
So how we feeling about Rob's girl?
We're happy for him, or...?

332
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:07,040
Oh, my God. The St. Pauli Grandma?
She seems all right.

333
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:08,578
She's pretty.

334
00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:10,613
You know,
in a "me in a wig" sort of way.

335
00:19:10,783 --> 00:19:12,182
Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

336
00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:17,879
When Ben Franklin was flying that kite
and it had the key on it...

337
00:19:18,057 --> 00:19:19,991
...that was to her apartment.

338
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,025
Oh, that was good, man.

339
00:19:22,195 --> 00:19:26,564
You know, but I gotta say,
he seems like he's in love, you know?

340
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:28,758
He was in love
with the first three wives.

341
00:19:28,935 --> 00:19:30,664
The Cheater, the Beater
and the Eater.

342
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:34,273
You know, his problem is he's always
so overly in love so quick, you know?

343
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,568
And then one day he snaps
and then it gets ugly in a hurry.

344
00:19:37,744 --> 00:19:39,109
Coffee, Mr. Feder?

345
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:40,906
No, no, no. I'm good, I'm good.

346
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,675
I mean, thank you. That's cool of you
to voluntarily wanna give me coffee.

347
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:48,981
Just, you drink it, you know, while
you're studying inside the church.

348
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:51,181
But you texted me you want coffee.

349
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:54,190
I texted you that I wanted you
to drink the coffee and study.

350
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,760
So study your books in the church.

351
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:59,228
Go ahead. All right, Rita.

352
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:01,128
Fast food? You guys eat the fast...?

353
00:20:06,105 --> 00:20:07,436
Mommy, I want some milk.

354
00:20:07,607 --> 00:20:12,237
Oh, sure, angel. You come here.
I'll give you a little something.

355
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,171
Slow down, honey.
Not such big gulps.

356
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:18,078
You're gonna get a tummy ache.

357
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,549
- Your son is so cute.
- Yeah.

358
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:23,746
How old is he?

359
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:27,624
Oh, he's 48 months.

360
00:20:27,794 --> 00:20:29,261
That's 4.

361
00:20:29,796 --> 00:20:30,854
Yeah.

362
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:34,124
We meant to stop last year,
but he likes it so much...

363
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,598
...and we don't like to say no.

364
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:38,464
Hey, sweetheart?

365
00:20:38,638 --> 00:20:40,663
Could you use a fork, please?

366
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:41,966
No.

367
00:20:42,141 --> 00:20:46,339
No, no, no!

368
00:20:46,512 --> 00:20:48,571
Looks like she didn't get the memo.

369
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:14,267
- Hey. Let me get that spot.
- Hey, gotta respect the Caddy.

370
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:16,799
It's nice you drove
your piggy bank here.

371
00:21:16,976 --> 00:21:18,443
- Hey.
- Hey.

372
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:19,873
Hey. Hi, Gloria.

373
00:21:20,046 --> 00:21:21,104
- Look at this.
- Come on.

374
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:22,339
Yeah.

375
00:21:22,515 --> 00:21:24,642
Hey, Rob's car
is an Oompa Loompa too.

376
00:21:24,817 --> 00:21:28,116
- Okay, watch the edge.
- It's cute. It'll do for one night.

377
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:29,687
Yeah? You can handle it?

378
00:21:31,858 --> 00:21:33,450
Daddy, what is that machine doing?

379
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,526
It's getting rid of the moths, honey.

380
00:21:35,695 --> 00:21:37,162
Where's it taking them?

381
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:38,888
- Hell.
- Don't say that, Higgins.

382
00:21:39,098 --> 00:21:40,531
I'm sorry. Not hell, Mexico.

383
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:44,568
No, it's giving them electricity...

384
00:21:44,737 --> 00:21:47,729
...so the moths fall asleep
electrically.

385
00:21:47,907 --> 00:21:49,340
It's electrocuting them?

386
00:21:49,509 --> 00:21:51,340
- No, no, no.
- But, Daddy, they're dying.

387
00:21:51,511 --> 00:21:52,876
- It's killing them?
- No.

388
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:54,871
Daddy, no.

389
00:21:55,048 --> 00:21:56,208
No, no, it's not.

390
00:21:56,382 --> 00:21:58,145
Okay? Let me adjust it.

391
00:21:58,318 --> 00:22:01,651
Look, they're all all right,
I promise you.

392
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:04,085
See? Look at this guy.

393
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:05,718
He's still sleeping.

394
00:22:05,892 --> 00:22:07,826
It's dead, Dad.

395
00:22:08,528 --> 00:22:10,052
A porch swing.

396
00:22:10,229 --> 00:22:12,595
I know what I'm doing this weekend.

397
00:22:15,702 --> 00:22:17,192
Now he's dead.

398
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:20,362
Welcome back to 1978, everybody.
The lake house.

399
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,840
Nothing's changed,
it's unbelievable.

400
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:24,943
I don't remember this big.

401
00:22:25,111 --> 00:22:27,739
This is my kitchen.
This is it, right now.

402
00:22:27,914 --> 00:22:29,745
Oh, please, enough with the kitchen.

403
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:31,042
Why you so mean?

404
00:22:31,217 --> 00:22:32,548
We could've done this.

405
00:22:32,719 --> 00:22:35,051
- An organ.
- Oh, my God, look at this kitchen.

406
00:22:35,221 --> 00:22:37,689
- That's enough, already.
- Could you at least humor me?

407
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:39,688
Is this like
an Outward Bound thing?

408
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:41,759
<i>I mean, it's like an episode of Lost.</i>

409
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:44,693
Hon, you might not
wanna bang on that.

410
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:46,593
But I like playing it like this.

411
00:22:46,766 --> 00:22:48,233
Okay. Okay.

412
00:22:48,401 --> 00:22:50,460
So listen, guys,
who's getting what room?

413
00:22:50,636 --> 00:22:53,104
Actually, I made a map
of who gets which room.

414
00:22:53,272 --> 00:22:56,070
I took the liberty of reserving
the room with the waterbed...

415
00:22:56,242 --> 00:22:57,971
...for Gloria and myself.

416
00:22:58,745 --> 00:23:02,112
You're gonna do
the backstroke tonight.

417
00:23:02,281 --> 00:23:04,306
I wanna go swimming
with you guys tonight.

418
00:23:04,484 --> 00:23:07,749
Oh, honey, we're not really going
swimming. What I meant was...

419
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,320
That's okay. She doesn't
need to know what you mean.

420
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:13,789
- I don't even know what you mean.
- Oh, I know what she meant.

421
00:23:14,327 --> 00:23:16,295
Anyway, let's get back
to the room picking.

422
00:23:16,462 --> 00:23:18,657
Rob, would you like
to take us on a tour?

423
00:23:18,831 --> 00:23:21,732
I'd love to show you a tour.
Gloria was just trying to be cool.

424
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:23,493
I need someplace near a bathroom.

425
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:25,967
Why does the grandma
get to go swimming and I don't?

426
00:23:26,139 --> 00:23:27,766
Let's go, let's go.

427
00:23:28,641 --> 00:23:30,575
Okay, here's the big daddy.

428
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:31,971
The master bedroom.

429
00:23:32,145 --> 00:23:35,478
You know what? Lenny should
have that. Lenny should have that.

430
00:23:35,648 --> 00:23:36,842
- Oh, no, no, no.
- I agree.

431
00:23:37,016 --> 00:23:39,109
Honey. Honey.
Come on, let the kids have it.

432
00:23:39,285 --> 00:23:42,982
It's a fun time for the kids to be
together and they can do kids' things.

433
00:23:43,156 --> 00:23:45,351
Come on, go share it.
Share the master bedroom.

434
00:23:45,525 --> 00:23:46,958
Kids win.

435
00:23:47,126 --> 00:23:48,423
Yeah. Yeah. Don't you think?

436
00:23:49,829 --> 00:23:50,853
Yeah, okay.

437
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,725
- Cool.
- Cool.

438
00:23:55,334 --> 00:23:56,767
Hey, Dad.

439
00:23:56,936 --> 00:24:00,133
What's the big box attached
to the back of the TV?

440
00:24:00,306 --> 00:24:02,297
That's the rest of the TV.

441
00:24:02,475 --> 00:24:04,966
They didn't always have
flat screens there, sport.

442
00:24:05,144 --> 00:24:09,046
Wow, that is some
Stone Age shiznit.

443
00:24:09,215 --> 00:24:12,207
- Yeah, that's wack.
- I need a room with heat.

444
00:24:12,385 --> 00:24:14,876
It's summer.
It's like 95 degrees in here.

445
00:24:15,455 --> 00:24:17,013
There he goes again.

446
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:18,714
I got bunions.

447
00:24:18,891 --> 00:24:21,951
You know, I actually have a poultice
I make, using maize and herbs.

448
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:24,028
Just say corn.
Maize is corn, everybody.

449
00:24:24,197 --> 00:24:26,722
Yeah, he says maize
because it sounds more mystical.

450
00:24:26,899 --> 00:24:29,527
Well, I like the way he said it.
"Maize."

451
00:24:29,702 --> 00:24:31,294
- "Maize."
- "Maize."

452
00:24:31,471 --> 00:24:33,336
- "Maize."
- "Maize."

453
00:24:33,506 --> 00:24:36,600
- It's fantastic, okay?
- It's a-maize-ing.

454
00:24:37,477 --> 00:24:40,207
I just spread it on cloth
and I moisten and heat it...

455
00:24:40,379 --> 00:24:42,973
...and then I apply it directly
to the affected area.

456
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:49,088
Okay. Well, my affected area
is pretty big.

457
00:24:49,255 --> 00:24:50,722
Oh, no.

458
00:24:51,858 --> 00:24:55,350
Mama, I didn't know
the Elephant Man lived in your shoe.

459
00:24:55,528 --> 00:24:58,088
How in the world's anybody supposed
to get some sleep...

460
00:24:58,264 --> 00:25:01,165
...knowing they under the same roof as
Toe-be Bryant over here?

461
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:04,504
You're stepping over the line,
woman.

462
00:25:10,076 --> 00:25:13,204
So, what's with that Labradoodle?
It sounds like Stephen Hawking.

463
00:25:13,379 --> 00:25:16,041
Curly, he had
his vocal cords clipped.

464
00:25:16,215 --> 00:25:18,115
A neighbor filed a complaint...

465
00:25:18,317 --> 00:25:22,378
...so it was either clip the cords
or put Curly down.

466
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:25,716
Wrong choice.

467
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:28,554
Come on, he's part of the family,
you know?

468
00:25:28,728 --> 00:25:32,357
Imagine when a burglar comes over
and hears that. He must run in terror.

469
00:25:32,532 --> 00:25:34,591
"Wow, what's that turkey
doing in the house?"

470
00:25:35,735 --> 00:25:37,726
By the way, Lamonsoff, your son.

471
00:25:37,904 --> 00:25:40,429
What's with the boob thing?
Isn't the kid a little old?

472
00:25:40,606 --> 00:25:42,870
He'll be rubbing her boob
with his beard soon.

473
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:46,705
He's gonna get a milk mustache on a
real mustache. That won't look right.

474
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:48,938
That kid, when he's 10, on his bike...

475
00:25:49,115 --> 00:25:52,107
...the mom's gonna be in the basket,
he's gonna be like:

476
00:25:55,121 --> 00:25:57,146
- Come on.
- Okay, wait, I got this one.

477
00:25:57,323 --> 00:25:58,722
<i>Chain saw pedicure, 50 points.</i>

478
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:01,359
Why are they inside right now,
anyways?

479
00:26:01,527 --> 00:26:03,995
Why would they not come out here
and enjoy the lake...

480
00:26:04,163 --> 00:26:05,630
...or do something in the woods?

481
00:26:05,798 --> 00:26:08,164
There wasn't a time of day
that I wasn't outside.

482
00:26:08,367 --> 00:26:11,234
You know, we weren't.
We were always... We were never in.

483
00:26:11,404 --> 00:26:13,133
<i>All heads on deck!</i>

484
00:26:13,306 --> 00:26:15,171
Look, there's blood
squirting everywhere!

485
00:26:15,341 --> 00:26:17,935
- I can't take it anymore.
- Chop his arms off.

486
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,941
Oh, he's being a dad. Look at this.

487
00:26:21,113 --> 00:26:23,411
Dad. Don't, Dad. My high score.

488
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:28,680
That's it. No more video games.
No more cell phones. No more texting.

489
00:26:28,854 --> 00:26:32,187
Just from now on, while we're here,
stay outside and play.

490
00:26:32,358 --> 00:26:33,655
What are we supposed to do?

491
00:26:33,826 --> 00:26:38,160
Just play like normal kids.
Come on, move it. Where's Becky?

492
00:26:38,331 --> 00:26:41,133
Let's go. Let me show you
how the Pilgrims used to hang.

493
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,603
When we were kids, your dad used to
talk us into doing the craziest stuff.

494
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:46,795
That's right.

495
00:26:46,973 --> 00:26:50,033
Yeah, I remember one time,
we got our shower curtains...

496
00:26:50,209 --> 00:26:53,337
...put them in shopping carts and went
shopping cart sailing.

497
00:26:53,512 --> 00:26:54,638
Wait, how did you steer?

498
00:26:54,814 --> 00:26:56,782
- Well, we didn't.
- How'd you stop?

499
00:26:56,949 --> 00:26:59,509
You just smashed into something.
That was the fun part.

500
00:26:59,685 --> 00:27:01,619
We used to shoot bottle rockets
at each other.

501
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:04,312
You go for the guy's face
because you wanna blind him.

502
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:06,151
Okay, no, that's a little much, pal.

503
00:27:06,325 --> 00:27:08,691
No. No, I know. Kids, don't do that.

504
00:27:08,861 --> 00:27:11,728
You know what, erase, reboot.

505
00:27:11,897 --> 00:27:15,560
Okay. Look, look.
Make a tree fort. I'll get you started.

506
00:27:15,735 --> 00:27:17,669
Rob lived in one of those for a year.

507
00:27:17,837 --> 00:27:19,429
Why?

508
00:27:19,605 --> 00:27:21,630
My dad took away my roller skates.

509
00:27:22,241 --> 00:27:24,141
Vietnam flashback.

510
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:27,237
Wait a minute. Are you kidding me?

511
00:27:27,446 --> 00:27:29,175
- What?
- What?

512
00:27:29,949 --> 00:27:31,007
Nice.

513
00:27:31,183 --> 00:27:33,310
Rope on a tree, baby.
You know what that means.

514
00:27:33,486 --> 00:27:34,817
We get to hang ourselves?

515
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:38,684
You see a rope and a lake and that
doesn't make you wanna go nuts?

516
00:27:38,858 --> 00:27:40,325
It makes me... You know what?

517
00:27:40,493 --> 00:27:42,518
You know what, let me show them.

518
00:27:42,695 --> 00:27:43,821
- Yeah.
- Yeah, baby.

519
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:45,395
Dude, get up on the top rock.

520
00:27:45,564 --> 00:27:48,089
- Yeah, you're right.
- You gotta back it up, back it up.

521
00:27:48,267 --> 00:27:49,359
Go, baby.

522
00:27:49,535 --> 00:27:51,867
The class is in session.

523
00:27:52,038 --> 00:27:54,029
Who wants to see a double flip?

524
00:27:55,141 --> 00:27:56,165
Too high.

525
00:27:56,342 --> 00:27:58,276
- Now drop.
- This was a mistake.

526
00:27:59,078 --> 00:28:00,602
I can't let go, I'm too scared.

527
00:28:08,754 --> 00:28:10,915
That was awesome.

528
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:14,184
Oh, God. Oh, God, my leg's snapped.

529
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,692
Oh, my God, the bone's sticking out.
I need help.

530
00:28:17,163 --> 00:28:20,599
It's a stick. I got you.

531
00:28:22,168 --> 00:28:23,260
Very good.

532
00:28:23,436 --> 00:28:25,700
Daddy, that bird is hurt.

533
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,404
Oh, my God. I'll go get a shoebox.

534
00:28:31,277 --> 00:28:33,108
Here you go.

535
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,679
Hey, did you really land
on that bird, man?

536
00:28:35,848 --> 00:28:36,872
I'm not sure.

537
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:40,951
I did hear a chirp and a crunch-like
noise, but that could've been anything.

538
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,722
Okay.

539
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:47,954
Keith. Sit down. Sit down.

540
00:28:48,127 --> 00:28:49,458
Dad, I wanna sit next to you.

541
00:28:49,628 --> 00:28:52,392
Daddy's gonna be down here with
his friends first and then...

542
00:28:52,565 --> 00:28:56,433
Lenny, remember we used to come
here late night after we got wasted?

543
00:28:58,237 --> 00:28:59,295
What's "wasted"?

544
00:28:59,805 --> 00:29:01,067
Nice one, Higgie.

545
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,936
"Wasted." kids...

546
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:06,806
...is something that happens...

547
00:29:06,979 --> 00:29:09,004
...when you have a hankering
for ice cream.

548
00:29:09,181 --> 00:29:10,876
- I wanna get wasted.
- I wanna get wasted.

549
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:12,415
I wanna get wasted every day.

550
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:14,576
I wanna get chocolate wasted.

551
00:29:14,754 --> 00:29:17,086
No, you don't need to get wasted,
it's okay.

552
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:19,816
All right, you know what,
let me make this easy.

553
00:29:19,992 --> 00:29:23,325
Seventeen burgers
and 17 fries, okay?

554
00:29:23,496 --> 00:29:27,296
And that'll be just for me.
What are you guys having?

555
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,224
Lamonsoff.

556
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:30,527
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

557
00:29:30,703 --> 00:29:32,694
That's for everybody.
Just put it on that.

558
00:29:32,872 --> 00:29:36,137
- Oh, you don't have to do that.
- I am not gonna have any hamburgers.

559
00:29:36,308 --> 00:29:39,209
I'll take some meat loaf,
some calzones...

560
00:29:39,378 --> 00:29:42,279
...but put the marinara sauce
on the side.

561
00:29:42,448 --> 00:29:45,349
With corn, either on the cob
or whatever you got.

562
00:29:45,518 --> 00:29:47,850
- Are you going to the electric chair?
- What?

563
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,988
No, he was just kidding, Henry VIII.

564
00:29:51,724 --> 00:29:54,955
She's eating for two:
her and Toe-bo Cop.

565
00:29:55,494 --> 00:29:58,554
But, Mama, they do have bunion rings
if you want some.

566
00:29:58,731 --> 00:30:00,130
That was good, Lenny.

567
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:01,561
How about some drinks?

568
00:30:01,734 --> 00:30:04,168
I said I'm paying,
so take it easy with that, okay?

569
00:30:04,336 --> 00:30:07,203
I'm kidding, everybody. I'm kidding.
We can drink all we want.

570
00:30:07,373 --> 00:30:09,238
I'll start it off.
I'm gonna have a Coke.

571
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:13,708
And I know Donna, she's gonna want
a Sprite, correct, sweetie? And...

572
00:30:14,647 --> 00:30:16,205
Bean's good with milk, obviously.

573
00:30:16,615 --> 00:30:18,708
I want cookies.

574
00:30:18,884 --> 00:30:20,215
Cookies and MILF.

575
00:30:20,386 --> 00:30:22,251
MILF? Oh, Higgins,
thank you so much.

576
00:30:22,421 --> 00:30:25,254
Take it easy, all right?
Hey, tuck it away, sweetie.

577
00:30:25,424 --> 00:30:27,415
And I'll take a flat water. Voss.

578
00:30:28,027 --> 00:30:29,051
What?

579
00:30:29,228 --> 00:30:31,594
You know, Voss.
Or Fiji, if you don't have Voss.

580
00:30:31,764 --> 00:30:33,823
Yeah, you know,
anything you got's good.

581
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:35,261
We have out of the faucet.

582
00:30:35,434 --> 00:30:36,731
Like, from a hose?

583
00:30:36,902 --> 00:30:37,926
Tap water.

584
00:30:38,103 --> 00:30:39,331
What country's that from?

585
00:30:39,505 --> 00:30:42,997
Oh, my God. Just get the water. We're
done talking about water. Tap water.

586
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:44,608
I go get the Voss from the b...

587
00:30:44,777 --> 00:30:48,508
You just sit down, Rita. Just study
a menu. The big test is coming.

588
00:30:56,522 --> 00:30:57,716
I'm sorry, what now?

589
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:00,358
He says they have the best burger
in town here.

590
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:03,956
Really? Since when did you learn
to speak Chinese?

591
00:31:04,129 --> 00:31:06,689
It's just something I picked up
watching a cooking show.

592
00:31:06,866 --> 00:31:10,597
That's great. Maybe you should focus
a little less on the talking...

593
00:31:10,769 --> 00:31:12,464
...and a little more on the cooking.

594
00:31:12,638 --> 00:31:14,299
Burn.

595
00:31:14,473 --> 00:31:16,600
You got told.

596
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:18,601
You got toe.

597
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:21,371
He comes back.

598
00:31:21,981 --> 00:31:24,745
Mommy, can I have some
of her milk?

599
00:31:25,251 --> 00:31:26,946
There he is.

600
00:31:27,152 --> 00:31:28,449
Joe Hollywood.

601
00:31:29,188 --> 00:31:31,554
Who's that? Dickie Bailey?

602
00:31:31,724 --> 00:31:32,884
Oh, my God.

603
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:35,891
Hey, long time no see.
How you doing, man?

604
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:38,325
You know, that game
had some bad calls.

605
00:31:38,731 --> 00:31:41,393
Now, what game are we talking about?
The game?

606
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:44,161
What, when we were kids
30 years ago, that game?

607
00:31:44,336 --> 00:31:46,167
That last shot?

608
00:31:46,338 --> 00:31:49,068
Your foot was on the line.
Shouldn't have counted.

609
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:52,472
I don't know. I don't remember it
quite like that.

610
00:31:52,645 --> 00:31:55,808
You got the rest
of the Fugly Five over there, huh?

611
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:58,049
Yes. Yes. They are.
The boys are here.

612
00:31:58,217 --> 00:31:59,241
Boys?

613
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:02,546
They don't look like they can make it
up and down the court anymore.

614
00:32:02,721 --> 00:32:04,916
What about you?
You put on a few pounds?

615
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:06,614
From when I was 12?

616
00:32:06,792 --> 00:32:08,726
Yes, I think so.

617
00:32:08,894 --> 00:32:11,294
You don't know how to come at me,
do you?

618
00:32:11,463 --> 00:32:12,487
Rematch. I dare you.

619
00:32:15,401 --> 00:32:18,666
In basketball? You don't look like
you're in the greatest shape either.

620
00:32:18,837 --> 00:32:22,102
I could see having
a getting-off-the-couch contest, but...

621
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:23,366
Anytime, anywhere.

622
00:32:23,542 --> 00:32:25,942
I was just kidding.
I really don't wanna do that.

623
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:30,104
Next time you come to town, I'll have
plenty of that Boss water for your kid.

624
00:32:30,683 --> 00:32:32,844
- All right.
- Wouldn't want him to go thirsty.

625
00:32:33,018 --> 00:32:37,478
All right, well, just for the record,
it's Voss water, by the way, with a V.

626
00:32:39,224 --> 00:32:40,282
Okay.

627
00:32:43,028 --> 00:32:46,156
Gonna be an emotional day tomorrow,
spreading the Buzzer's ashes.

628
00:32:46,332 --> 00:32:47,356
Oh, my God.

629
00:32:47,533 --> 00:32:50,764
The coach requested that we
scatter his remains on Mclntyre Island.

630
00:32:50,936 --> 00:32:52,563
I got a beautiful ceremony planned.

631
00:32:52,738 --> 00:32:55,536
Lenny, you gonna be able to do that?
What time do you leave?

632
00:32:55,975 --> 00:32:58,443
- What are you talking about?
- What do you mean, leave?

633
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:02,171
I forgot to tell you, fellas.
We gotta take off in the morning.

634
00:33:02,348 --> 00:33:04,282
- You're leaving?
- You can't leave.

635
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:07,419
- We got the ceremony tomorrow.
- Lenny's just playing, everybody.

636
00:33:07,586 --> 00:33:08,678
No, he's not.

637
00:33:08,854 --> 00:33:10,014
Are you joking?

638
00:33:10,189 --> 00:33:14,057
I wanna be there. I mean, we all wanna
be there. We gotta go to Milan.

639
00:33:14,226 --> 00:33:16,854
Milan, what? Italy? What's in Milan?

640
00:33:17,429 --> 00:33:20,057
It's pretty cool.
Roxanne's got her fall line coming out.

641
00:33:20,232 --> 00:33:23,690
- Fashion week.
- Three nights at the Four Seasons.

642
00:33:23,869 --> 00:33:25,530
Eggs Benedict by the pool...

643
00:33:25,704 --> 00:33:27,831
...PlayStation 3 in every room...

644
00:33:28,007 --> 00:33:30,567
...and they show boobies
on Italian TV.

645
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:33,400
I'm going to Italy.

646
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:38,275
No, we all... I didn't tell you guys,
we're probably gonna go to Italy as a...

647
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:39,917
Thanks for ruining the surprise.

648
00:33:40,419 --> 00:33:42,512
Lenny, it's not gonna be the same
without you.

649
00:33:42,688 --> 00:33:43,712
Yeah, come on.

650
00:33:43,889 --> 00:33:47,017
Roxanne was cool enough to let us
come tonight. This is a big deal.

651
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:49,786
Can't Roxanne go without you
and you can meet her there?

652
00:33:49,962 --> 00:33:54,126
No, we are a team, me and my lady,
and we do everything together.

653
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:57,860
Last year, we had to skip
Becky's school play for Milan.

654
00:33:58,437 --> 00:34:00,200
Roxanne.

655
00:34:00,572 --> 00:34:02,005
Roxanne.

656
00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:06,537
I thought we were
gonna get wasted.

657
00:34:07,246 --> 00:34:09,806
Sweetie. What was I supposed to do,
lie to them?

658
00:34:09,982 --> 00:34:12,917
It's not what you said.
It's how you said it.

659
00:34:13,085 --> 00:34:17,522
I am not some insensitive
work-crazy dragon lady.

660
00:34:17,689 --> 00:34:20,453
And I'm not gonna let you
depict me as one.

661
00:34:20,626 --> 00:34:22,617
We are skipping the dinner
in Milan...

662
00:34:22,828 --> 00:34:24,193
...spreading the ashes...

663
00:34:24,363 --> 00:34:26,763
...and we're leaving first thing
Sunday morning.

664
00:34:34,907 --> 00:34:39,207
Lamonsoff, it's 5 in the morning.
Can you kill the dog now?

665
00:34:39,445 --> 00:34:40,776
Thinking about it.

666
00:34:41,547 --> 00:34:44,573
Go ahead.
Birdy coming through, everybody.

667
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:45,808
Hey, morning.

668
00:34:45,984 --> 00:34:47,975
Morning.
Take it right over to the table.

669
00:34:48,153 --> 00:34:50,121
How we doing?
Something stinks in here.

670
00:34:50,289 --> 00:34:52,621
Gloria and I are making breakfast
for everybody.

671
00:34:52,791 --> 00:34:56,784
Using a dehydrator, which never
cooks anything above 115 degrees.

672
00:34:56,962 --> 00:34:58,987
- Those are pancakes?
- Ocean pancakes.

673
00:34:59,164 --> 00:35:02,327
They're gray. They look like you
cut them off an elephant's legs.

674
00:35:02,501 --> 00:35:04,799
- I'm not eating that.
- It's good for you.

675
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:06,835
- What is this?
- "What is this?"

676
00:35:07,005 --> 00:35:08,199
A scab?

677
00:35:08,373 --> 00:35:09,635
It's dehydrated banana.

678
00:35:09,808 --> 00:35:12,504
What happened to a normal banana?
Peel a banana and eat it.

679
00:35:12,678 --> 00:35:15,374
The kids'll love it. It's fun, man.
It doesn't go bad.

680
00:35:15,547 --> 00:35:17,447
- You slice it thin...
- I see what you do.

681
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:19,277
Maybe you're right. This is good.

682
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:21,510
- Is that what it's meant for?
- You could.

683
00:35:21,687 --> 00:35:25,487
Well, I'd rather be hit by
dehydrated fruit than processed...

684
00:35:25,657 --> 00:35:26,681
Processed food.

685
00:35:26,859 --> 00:35:29,726
- I'm just kidding around.
- You think you can just slap people.

686
00:35:29,895 --> 00:35:32,887
I don't think that. Don't say that.
Come on.

687
00:35:33,065 --> 00:35:34,327
Morning.

688
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,627
Honey, how is the birdy?

689
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:40,570
Those are
the Christian Louboutin shoes.

690
00:35:40,739 --> 00:35:41,865
I know I'm overdressed.

691
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:46,067
But, sorry, I packed for Milan,
not the lake.

692
00:35:47,146 --> 00:35:48,511
Made from acorns.

693
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:52,013
So, dude, I'm not eating any of this.
You got any normal food? Cereal?

694
00:35:52,184 --> 00:35:54,982
Would you like me to make you
egg-white frittata, Mr. Feder?

695
00:35:56,722 --> 00:35:59,350
I mean, is that what you're doing
in science class now?

696
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:01,349
Making frittatas?

697
00:36:01,527 --> 00:36:04,394
No. We're okay. You can go
practice that in your room, though.

698
00:36:04,563 --> 00:36:06,827
I know you got the big test coming.

699
00:36:08,066 --> 00:36:10,432
You know, honey,
I think you're overwhelming Lenny.

700
00:36:10,602 --> 00:36:13,070
Here, I got a present for you.

701
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:14,934
Bacon.

702
00:36:15,107 --> 00:36:16,938
- Knock yourself out.
- Bacon.

703
00:36:17,409 --> 00:36:18,433
She gets it.

704
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:21,010
She gets it. She gets it.
Hey, she gets it.

705
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,410
Thank God she gets it.

706
00:36:23,582 --> 00:36:25,049
All right, so...

707
00:36:25,217 --> 00:36:26,844
Hey, what are you doing?

708
00:36:27,586 --> 00:36:28,610
Cooking the bacon.

709
00:36:28,787 --> 00:36:32,245
Not in here. That's dead animal flesh.
It's not going near the vegan food.

710
00:36:32,424 --> 00:36:33,516
Murderer.

711
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:36,183
Fine. What do I do with it?
Oh, I know.

712
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:38,022
I'm sorry, buddy. I'm sorry.

713
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,992
Curly. Shame on you.

714
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:46,660
That crazy dog.

715
00:36:46,838 --> 00:36:50,035
Must have got into some of my leftover
pasta fasul.

716
00:36:50,209 --> 00:36:52,871
Yeah, Mama, I'm sure
that's exactly what happened.

717
00:36:53,045 --> 00:36:54,205
It did.

718
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:55,971
We should get a dog.

719
00:36:56,682 --> 00:36:59,480
We should get a water buffalo.

720
00:37:01,019 --> 00:37:02,316
Higgins, what are you doing?

721
00:37:02,487 --> 00:37:06,321
I don't wear pants at my house, I'm not
wearing them in your house. Sorry.

722
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:09,761
That was a man's ass?

723
00:37:09,828 --> 00:37:11,523
All right.

724
00:37:15,167 --> 00:37:16,964
Yeah.

725
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:20,231
Let's see this. Look at that.

726
00:37:26,612 --> 00:37:28,079
That's it, buddy.

727
00:37:28,247 --> 00:37:29,874
Okay, throw the rock.

728
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:32,282
Skim it.

729
00:37:33,218 --> 00:37:34,480
Throw it at a tree.

730
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,911
Throw it at the lake.

731
00:37:37,823 --> 00:37:39,757
Throw it at your brother.

732
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:41,153
Hit your head with it.

733
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,287
Just do something.

734
00:37:46,164 --> 00:37:47,631
Come on.

735
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:51,992
What are you doing dressed like that?
You hanging out with Jiminy Cricket?

736
00:37:52,404 --> 00:37:54,634
We were supposed to be going
to Milan, remember?

737
00:37:54,806 --> 00:37:56,171
That's what I packed for.

738
00:37:56,341 --> 00:37:57,603
Just cut those into shorts.

739
00:37:57,776 --> 00:37:59,971
- We'll play some hoop later.
- Pass, dude.

740
00:38:00,145 --> 00:38:02,545
You don't want revenge
for the time I whupped you?

741
00:38:02,714 --> 00:38:04,181
That was four years ago, homey.

742
00:38:04,349 --> 00:38:08,046
All I want is to fly to Milan
and have some fresh-made gelato.

743
00:38:09,755 --> 00:38:11,950
What would your father have done
on that one?

744
00:38:12,124 --> 00:38:14,888
That one would've been a backhand
to the side of the head...

745
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:16,857
...and possible bleeding from the ear.

746
00:38:17,029 --> 00:38:20,487
My father would've thrown me down
the stairs for using the word gelato.

747
00:38:21,233 --> 00:38:23,895
- You got the new Foreman.
- Yeah.

748
00:38:24,069 --> 00:38:27,129
Hilliard was trying to make me
some tofu Grape-Nuts in there.

749
00:38:27,306 --> 00:38:28,364
Try it out.

750
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:30,667
- You cleaned this?
- Yeah, I cleaned this thing.

751
00:38:30,842 --> 00:38:31,934
- Take it.
- Thanks a lot.

752
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:34,078
By the way,
Mclntyre Island ain't close.

753
00:38:34,246 --> 00:38:36,680
Eat as much as you can,
we got a big row ahead of us.

754
00:38:38,016 --> 00:38:39,711
You didn't clean that well.

755
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:43,554
Come on, man.
What are you doing to me? Seriously.

756
00:38:43,722 --> 00:38:47,055
You don't want your breath to smell
like your grandmother's closet?

757
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:00,130
Slow down for Robbie, guys.

758
00:39:00,305 --> 00:39:01,533
You're gonna lap me.

759
00:39:02,474 --> 00:39:05,170
Beautiful. You gotta respect
going to Mclntyre Island.

760
00:39:05,344 --> 00:39:07,005
Haven't done that since we're 12.

761
00:39:07,179 --> 00:39:08,840
Got my first boob there.

762
00:39:09,014 --> 00:39:11,278
- I know. Tracy Thornhill.
- Tracy Thorn...

763
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:13,077
- Yes.
- Absolutely.

764
00:39:13,251 --> 00:39:14,741
A little flat, but I was a fan.

765
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,753
All right, Higgins. Is that all you
think about is chicks?

766
00:39:17,923 --> 00:39:20,323
- We got daughters.
- That's all you guys think about.

767
00:39:20,492 --> 00:39:23,723
- Difference is, I can do something.
- Not true. All right, that's true.

768
00:39:23,895 --> 00:39:25,920
You wanna know
what I fantasize about?

769
00:39:26,098 --> 00:39:27,122
Candy bars.

770
00:39:27,299 --> 00:39:28,323
Candy bars?

771
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,867
No, I had a bad blood sugar test at
my last checkup and Sally cut me off.

772
00:39:32,037 --> 00:39:34,028
You're a grown man,
how do you deal with that?

773
00:39:34,206 --> 00:39:36,800
Oh, I got my own hidden stash,
I'm not stupid.

774
00:39:36,975 --> 00:39:38,237
Seriously, I got it all.

775
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:40,640
I got Reese's, Butterfingers,
3 Musketeers.

776
00:39:40,812 --> 00:39:44,714
I hide them under my clothes
in the bottom of the hamper.

777
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:48,410
It's great because the smell in my
sweat socks mask the chocolate smell.

778
00:39:48,587 --> 00:39:51,317
And the looks of your underwear
masks the chocolate stains.

779
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:54,050
Hey, hey, hey, hang on, guys.
I gotta make a sissy.

780
00:39:54,226 --> 00:39:55,887
- No, no, no.
- I gotta make a sissy.

781
00:39:56,061 --> 00:39:57,426
You made three already.

782
00:39:57,829 --> 00:39:59,797
It must be just oozing out at this point.

783
00:39:59,965 --> 00:40:01,626
Shut up, I'm trying to concentrate.

784
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,893
It's taking a piss, not the SATs.

785
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:14,807
Are you peeing or is a diesel truck
turning off? What the hell is that?

786
00:40:15,547 --> 00:40:17,276
Listen to hamper bottom.

787
00:40:17,449 --> 00:40:19,815
I think he's sending a message
in Morse code.

788
00:40:20,085 --> 00:40:21,950
Getting old. Stop.

789
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,917
Can't pee. Stop.

790
00:40:24,222 --> 00:40:25,814
Reeks like asparagus. Stop.

791
00:40:25,991 --> 00:40:28,084
Even though I didn't even have any.
Stop.

792
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,660
The good news is these girls
are gonna say hi to it.

793
00:40:31,696 --> 00:40:33,687
- What's up, ladies?
- Hey, girls.

794
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:37,159
- That is so gross-looking.
- Did you see that?

795
00:40:37,335 --> 00:40:41,237
- They don't all look like that, ladies.
- You gave that thing 300 pounds...

796
00:40:41,406 --> 00:40:42,498
Come on.

797
00:40:47,512 --> 00:40:49,343
Sick mix tape you made, Robbie.

798
00:40:49,514 --> 00:40:53,211
- Oh, yeah.
- Hey, guys, I brought something too.

799
00:40:53,385 --> 00:40:55,478
- Get out of here.
- It's the net, yeah.

800
00:40:55,654 --> 00:40:57,053
Championship game.

801
00:40:57,222 --> 00:40:59,690
- Let me see that.
- I thought the coach should have it.

802
00:40:59,858 --> 00:41:02,292
Robbie, you gotta put this
on the urn, buddy.

803
00:41:02,461 --> 00:41:03,519
That's cool.

804
00:41:03,728 --> 00:41:06,253
- "Your foot was on the line."
- Bailey.

805
00:41:06,431 --> 00:41:10,026
What do you think the coach would've
said if he heard that trash-talking?

806
00:41:10,202 --> 00:41:12,067
He'd kick our ass
for not kicking his.

807
00:41:12,237 --> 00:41:14,000
- Yeah.
- Or we do it the old-school way.

808
00:41:14,172 --> 00:41:16,538
- Have Eric beat his ass for us.
- I know, we should.

809
00:41:16,708 --> 00:41:20,644
No, no, no. I got about eight seconds
of fighting, total, left in my life.

810
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:22,780
And I'm saving that in case
I get mugged...

811
00:41:22,948 --> 00:41:25,849
...or, you know, someone cuts
in front of me at Burger King.

812
00:41:26,017 --> 00:41:29,316
- That's my hamper bottom.
- We can't delay it anymore, guys.

813
00:41:29,488 --> 00:41:32,582
- He just bit his chicken. All right.
- Are we going? Okay.

814
00:41:32,757 --> 00:41:34,122
Let's do it.

815
00:41:34,292 --> 00:41:37,261
You know, I think the coach
is here with us.

816
00:41:37,896 --> 00:41:41,388
I think he's proud to be here with us
in ash form.

817
00:41:41,566 --> 00:41:44,296
Right here on this island,
where we hid from our parents...

818
00:41:44,469 --> 00:41:46,937
...and where we're hiding
from our wives and children.

819
00:41:47,105 --> 00:41:48,163
Yes, we are.

820
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:52,870
Goodbye to you...

821
00:41:53,812 --> 00:41:55,040
...friend...

822
00:41:57,816 --> 00:41:59,681
...wise-advice giver...

823
00:42:05,824 --> 00:42:07,792
...buzzer-noise maker.

824
00:42:14,666 --> 00:42:16,099
Rob, come on.

825
00:42:16,268 --> 00:42:18,668
I really messed up my marriages.

826
00:42:19,004 --> 00:42:20,232
All of them.

827
00:42:20,405 --> 00:42:22,100
It was my fault, man.

828
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,864
I just couldn't hang on.

829
00:42:24,509 --> 00:42:26,875
You know, my own daughters...

830
00:42:27,312 --> 00:42:29,576
...I don't even hardly know them.

831
00:42:29,981 --> 00:42:32,211
- The Buzzer would be ashamed of me.
- No.

832
00:42:32,384 --> 00:42:33,408
Come on, now.

833
00:42:33,585 --> 00:42:35,985
You got time to patch things up
with your daughters.

834
00:42:36,154 --> 00:42:38,384
You just call them
when you get back.

835
00:42:38,557 --> 00:42:42,084
Actually, they're gonna be here
in about 20 minutes.

836
00:42:43,628 --> 00:42:44,993
Wait, what?

837
00:42:45,163 --> 00:42:46,596
I can use a piece of chicken.

838
00:42:47,132 --> 00:42:49,396
No, not with those hands.
Coach hands. All right.

839
00:42:49,568 --> 00:42:50,762
Finish the bucket.

840
00:42:50,936 --> 00:42:54,303
Actually, I'm still gonna eat it.
This is pretty sick, but I'm hungry.

841
00:43:01,613 --> 00:43:03,103
Lamonsoff.

842
00:43:04,215 --> 00:43:06,649
Go, old bucket. Drop it.

843
00:43:22,867 --> 00:43:25,233
Piece of crap car.

844
00:43:26,037 --> 00:43:27,504
What?

845
00:43:28,273 --> 00:43:29,331
Hey, Dad.

846
00:43:30,475 --> 00:43:31,999
Me?

847
00:43:34,379 --> 00:43:35,710
What?

848
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:38,007
- How do you get that...
- Hey.

849
00:43:38,183 --> 00:43:39,377
...from that?

850
00:43:39,884 --> 00:43:42,512
Ninety-five percent of that's gotta be
from the mother.

851
00:43:42,687 --> 00:43:44,279
And I am lowballing.

852
00:43:44,456 --> 00:43:45,684
Hey, Jasmine.

853
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:47,517
How is that possible?

854
00:43:47,692 --> 00:43:49,785
Oh, no. The Elvis hairs
are going up her nose.

855
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:51,519
She doesn't know what to do.

856
00:43:51,696 --> 00:43:52,720
That's sweet.

857
00:43:52,897 --> 00:43:54,194
Is this your car?

858
00:43:54,766 --> 00:43:57,132
My old man lent me this turd.

859
00:43:57,636 --> 00:44:00,696
Because he doesn't care if I
break down in the middle of nowhere...

860
00:44:00,872 --> 00:44:02,499
...and get eaten by a bear.

861
00:44:02,674 --> 00:44:03,971
Your old man?

862
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:06,906
Yeah, my boyfriend.
Forty-seven years old.

863
00:44:07,078 --> 00:44:09,239
You know,
I wish I liked guys my own age...

864
00:44:09,414 --> 00:44:12,474
...but I'm just chasing the dad
that ran out on me.

865
00:44:25,563 --> 00:44:27,463
Hoochie mama.

866
00:44:28,667 --> 00:44:30,328
What does that mean?

867
00:44:30,802 --> 00:44:33,396
I don't know, but it feels right.

868
00:44:40,378 --> 00:44:42,437
I hope that car never gets fixed.

869
00:44:43,648 --> 00:44:44,774
I don't think it will.

870
00:44:44,949 --> 00:44:46,348
I took the spark plugs out.

871
00:44:46,518 --> 00:44:47,712
Nice.

872
00:44:50,288 --> 00:44:53,485
We're all looking at the same time.
Let's at least take shifts.

873
00:44:53,658 --> 00:44:55,421
Lamonsoff,
you and me look at the tree.

874
00:44:55,593 --> 00:44:58,153
McKenzie, we're gonna look
at her butt for a little bit.

875
00:44:58,329 --> 00:45:00,160
All right. Good plan.

876
00:45:00,498 --> 00:45:02,625
And, shift.

877
00:45:05,236 --> 00:45:06,362
Shift.

878
00:45:07,572 --> 00:45:09,506
Shift.

879
00:45:10,408 --> 00:45:11,670
Shift.

880
00:45:12,143 --> 00:45:13,440
And shift.

881
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:16,176
What are we doing?

882
00:45:16,548 --> 00:45:18,778
Wait, are we all looking at the tree
right now?

883
00:45:18,983 --> 00:45:20,746
Yeah. Let's go back to the ass.

884
00:45:21,152 --> 00:45:23,586
Hey, Jasmine. This is Gloria.

885
00:45:23,755 --> 00:45:25,814
Gloria, this is Jasmine.

886
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:27,457
Hi.

887
00:45:28,827 --> 00:45:31,796
Oh, look, here comes Grandma Gloria
to the rescue.

888
00:45:31,963 --> 00:45:33,988
Let me take a look.

889
00:45:35,667 --> 00:45:37,225
Oh, honey.

890
00:45:37,402 --> 00:45:40,166
You've blown your gasket.

891
00:45:58,189 --> 00:46:00,282
No good.

892
00:46:01,659 --> 00:46:03,862
That was rough.

893
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:06,453
If you guys thought seeing them
at the car was gross...

894
00:46:06,631 --> 00:46:08,758
...you should have heard
that waterbed action.

895
00:46:08,933 --> 00:46:11,458
Sounded like two grizzlies
fighting over a salmon.

896
00:46:11,636 --> 00:46:14,434
- There was a lot happening.
- At least he's getting something.

897
00:46:14,606 --> 00:46:17,336
I've been shut out since Deanne
found out she was pregnant.

898
00:46:17,509 --> 00:46:20,137
- That'll happen.
- You have sex when they're pregnant?

899
00:46:20,311 --> 00:46:22,176
- Does that hurt the baby?
- McKenzie can.

900
00:46:22,347 --> 00:46:24,338
The baby thinks
he's getting a Tootsie Roll.

901
00:46:24,549 --> 00:46:26,847
- That's good.
- Snickers. Snickers.

902
00:46:27,018 --> 00:46:28,679
A little bigger. A little bigger.

903
00:46:28,853 --> 00:46:32,516
I got lucky on Saint Paddy's Day,
but she was half-asleep.

904
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:34,590
And by half-asleep,
I mean she was asleep.

905
00:46:34,759 --> 00:46:36,226
Yeah, she was out. Yeah.

906
00:46:36,394 --> 00:46:37,656
You're allowed to do that.

907
00:46:37,829 --> 00:46:39,490
She'd rather not be awake.

908
00:46:39,664 --> 00:46:43,395
- Hey, how'd it go with the daughter?
- Awkward.

909
00:46:44,803 --> 00:46:48,671
I guess the first 20 years of a kid's
life is more important than I realized.

910
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:51,135
Yeah. It's always the kids who pay.

911
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:52,674
Kids pay.

912
00:46:52,844 --> 00:46:54,209
- They pay.
- They pay.

913
00:46:54,379 --> 00:46:56,643
- They always pay.
- But they pay with maize.

914
00:46:56,815 --> 00:46:58,339
Was good hanging with you guys.

915
00:46:58,516 --> 00:47:00,950
- No, no, no. We're catching up.
- Come on, man.

916
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:04,213
I'm glad my family turmoil can
provide entertainment for you guys.

917
00:47:04,389 --> 00:47:07,324
Let's cheer him up. How did we cheer
Robbie up in the old days?

918
00:47:07,492 --> 00:47:09,323
A little arrow roulette?

919
00:47:09,561 --> 00:47:11,392
- Arrow roulette.
- Did we really do that?

920
00:47:11,563 --> 00:47:13,497
Single stupidest thing we ever did.

921
00:47:13,665 --> 00:47:14,689
It was the craziest.

922
00:47:14,866 --> 00:47:16,231
- Moronic.
- Asinine.

923
00:47:17,735 --> 00:47:20,761
- All right, fellas.
- I can't believe we're doing this.

924
00:47:20,939 --> 00:47:23,908
How do we always let Lenny
talk us into the stupidest stuff?

925
00:47:24,075 --> 00:47:26,839
Remember, whoever stays
in the circle the longest wins.

926
00:47:27,011 --> 00:47:29,343
- I don't like that part.
- Whoever stays longest.

927
00:47:29,514 --> 00:47:32,608
Okay, guys, here we go.
And a one. And a two...

928
00:47:32,784 --> 00:47:34,217
Why are we doing this?

929
00:47:35,053 --> 00:47:36,486
Go.

930
00:47:37,555 --> 00:47:38,852
Hold.

931
00:47:40,225 --> 00:47:41,886
- I don't see it.
- Where is it?

932
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:43,618
- I lost it in the sun.
- I lose.

933
00:48:19,664 --> 00:48:22,599
Curly.

934
00:48:42,587 --> 00:48:44,282
I am the champion.

935
00:48:44,455 --> 00:48:47,083
I beat all you pansies.

936
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:58,967
Go, go. Come on, come on, come on.
Hurry up.

937
00:48:59,137 --> 00:49:01,128
Oh, you're moving it.
You're shaking it.

938
00:49:01,306 --> 00:49:02,364
My hammy.

939
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:05,100
You complaining about your hammy?
I got an arrow in my foot.

940
00:49:05,276 --> 00:49:06,766
- Easy, easy.
- Stay calm.

941
00:49:06,945 --> 00:49:08,139
What's going on?

942
00:49:08,313 --> 00:49:10,975
- Rob got attacked by an Indian.
- Yeah, but he got away.

943
00:49:11,149 --> 00:49:12,980
- What?
- He got attacked by an Indian?

944
00:49:13,151 --> 00:49:16,518
- Daddy, what happened?
- Amber. I'm glad you got here.

945
00:49:16,688 --> 00:49:19,122
This is my daughter Amber,
everybody.

946
00:49:20,391 --> 00:49:21,619
You got another one?

947
00:49:21,793 --> 00:49:24,284
- Dude, high five.
- No, no high five, my wife's coming.

948
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:28,665
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- God, you made me look at this.

949
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:30,460
This is killing me.

950
00:49:30,635 --> 00:49:32,967
Bridget, come down here.
Daddy's hurt.

951
00:49:33,137 --> 00:49:35,002
- You got another one?
- Yeah.

952
00:49:35,506 --> 00:49:37,337
Hey.

953
00:49:37,508 --> 00:49:39,100
- Oh, okay.
- "Hey."

954
00:49:39,277 --> 00:49:40,608
DNA.

955
00:49:40,778 --> 00:49:42,746
- Now I get it.
- Rob's her mom and dad.

956
00:49:42,914 --> 00:49:44,006
Now that makes sense.

957
00:49:44,182 --> 00:49:47,015
Shut up. Foot, arrow, why?

958
00:49:47,185 --> 00:49:50,154
- I think we gotta pull it through.
- Oh, let me do it.

959
00:49:51,222 --> 00:49:52,712
It was my idea, I said it first.

960
00:49:52,890 --> 00:49:56,326
- Don't you hog it. Don't you touch him.
- Nobody touch him.

961
00:49:56,995 --> 00:49:58,519
We're gonna be all right here.

962
00:49:58,696 --> 00:50:01,494
All we need is a poultice with some
maize that will draw...

963
00:50:01,666 --> 00:50:03,099
Oh, shut up.

964
00:50:03,267 --> 00:50:05,258
That poultice shit doesn't work.

965
00:50:05,436 --> 00:50:07,097
It never worked. Are you insane?

966
00:50:07,271 --> 00:50:09,398
Get some alcohol on this bitch.

967
00:50:09,574 --> 00:50:11,166
You should know plenty about that.

968
00:50:11,342 --> 00:50:13,037
You were born
during the Prohibition.

969
00:50:14,212 --> 00:50:15,304
And there's the snap.

970
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,675
That was bigger
than I thought it was gonna be.

971
00:50:17,849 --> 00:50:19,384
Snap, crackle and pop.

972
00:50:20,852 --> 00:50:23,116
Abnormal origin. Pancreas.
Abnormal...

973
00:50:23,287 --> 00:50:25,881
Such a mess. Such a mess.
I can not...

974
00:50:27,892 --> 00:50:31,953
Excuse me? Princess Rita?
Are you gonna help me?

975
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:35,099
No, Mr. Feder said
that I must study for the big final.

976
00:50:35,266 --> 00:50:36,290
What final?

977
00:50:36,467 --> 00:50:39,197
You tell me.
He just keep handing me books.

978
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:41,930
Never mind. Did you pack
the adapters for Italy?

979
00:50:42,106 --> 00:50:43,539
Yes, I did in L.A.

980
00:50:43,708 --> 00:50:45,039
Great. Just wipe your hands.

981
00:50:45,209 --> 00:50:48,701
I need you to organize all these papers
in here very neatly, okay?

982
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:50,609
They cannot be ruined.

983
00:50:51,082 --> 00:50:52,481
Hello.

984
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:55,275
Hi, this is Roxanne Feder.
I just wanna make sure...

985
00:50:55,453 --> 00:50:58,581
Mommy. Mommy.
It came out. It came out.

986
00:50:58,756 --> 00:51:00,485
Hold on,
I'm on the phone, okay?

987
00:51:00,658 --> 00:51:02,751
My tooth. It fell out.

988
00:51:02,927 --> 00:51:04,019
That's great, honey.

989
00:51:04,195 --> 00:51:07,164
Put it under the pillow
and I'll put a dollar in there later.

990
00:51:07,331 --> 00:51:08,389
What?

991
00:51:08,566 --> 00:51:12,297
Becky, I'm on the phone.
I'll put the dollar under...

992
00:51:13,938 --> 00:51:15,906
Why would you?

993
00:51:18,276 --> 00:51:21,074
There's no Tooth Fairy?

994
00:51:31,055 --> 00:51:33,455
I can't believe I just did that.

995
00:51:35,426 --> 00:51:38,156
Oh, Lenny, you should have seen
her little face.

996
00:51:38,763 --> 00:51:40,355
I don't know what's wrong with me.

997
00:51:40,531 --> 00:51:43,967
I mean, I try so hard
and I can't seem to get anything right.

998
00:51:44,135 --> 00:51:46,296
You made a mistake.
Parents make mistakes.

999
00:51:46,471 --> 00:51:49,963
Remember the time I told Greg that
babies come from mommies' poop...

1000
00:51:50,141 --> 00:51:52,735
...and he kept looking in the toilet
for a baby brother?

1001
00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:55,674
- That's not funny.
- I'm just saying.

1002
00:51:55,847 --> 00:51:58,145
Can you hear me now? Okay.

1003
00:51:58,316 --> 00:51:59,783
I just feel...

1004
00:51:59,951 --> 00:52:01,942
What about now?
Now can you hear me?

1005
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:04,213
I feel like I ruined her childhood.

1006
00:52:05,423 --> 00:52:07,050
She was gonna find out eventually.

1007
00:52:07,225 --> 00:52:09,887
Eventually, but not today.

1008
00:52:11,062 --> 00:52:12,859
Can you hear me now?
This is so cool.

1009
00:52:13,030 --> 00:52:16,693
- Are you there?
- Hey, didn't I say no cell phones?

1010
00:52:17,468 --> 00:52:19,163
I thought we had a deal.

1011
00:52:19,337 --> 00:52:21,202
- What?
- What's up, Dad?

1012
00:52:22,173 --> 00:52:23,401
Are those cup phones?

1013
00:52:23,574 --> 00:52:25,565
Yeah, Charlotte taught us.
Cool, huh?

1014
00:52:25,743 --> 00:52:26,835
Hey, check out Becky's.

1015
00:52:27,011 --> 00:52:29,571
Look, Dad. I have cup waiting.

1016
00:52:29,747 --> 00:52:32,079
I gotta call you back,
I'm on with SpongeBob.

1017
00:52:36,053 --> 00:52:37,577
Was that a turkey?

1018
00:52:37,755 --> 00:52:39,017
Yo, Andre, can you hear me?

1019
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:40,680
Crystal clear. Can you hear me?

1020
00:52:40,858 --> 00:52:42,348
Oh, yeah.

1021
00:52:48,933 --> 00:52:52,266
So the best thing about these
is we can leave a cup in the shower...

1022
00:52:52,436 --> 00:52:54,734
...and listen to Jasmine
clean herself tomorrow.

1023
00:52:54,906 --> 00:52:56,032
- What?
- Oh, my God!

1024
00:52:56,207 --> 00:52:57,799
May I borrow this?

1025
00:52:57,975 --> 00:52:59,033
Attention, children.

1026
00:52:59,477 --> 00:53:02,002
There's been a request
from the phone company.

1027
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:07,049
Would you please install cup phones
in every adult bedroom right away?

1028
00:53:07,218 --> 00:53:09,618
Thank you. All right. Go.
Move it, move it, move it.

1029
00:53:09,787 --> 00:53:11,277
I said, move it. Move it.

1030
00:53:33,477 --> 00:53:36,844
Yes, I have always been
the Tooth Fairy.

1031
00:53:37,148 --> 00:53:40,709
No, Bean's mommy
is the Tooth Fairy for his family.

1032
00:53:40,885 --> 00:53:43,046
I just cover our family.

1033
00:53:44,021 --> 00:53:47,047
No, do not tell Bean, okay?

1034
00:53:47,225 --> 00:53:51,685
Becky, I love you
so, so, so much, okay?

1035
00:53:52,029 --> 00:53:54,293
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

1036
00:53:54,465 --> 00:53:57,400
- Okay, you're costing me a fortune.
- No, you hang up first.

1037
00:53:57,568 --> 00:53:59,866
Let's go.
This is gonna be a high cup bill.

1038
00:54:00,037 --> 00:54:03,006
It's nice to put maize
on your arrow wound.

1039
00:54:03,174 --> 00:54:05,438
What the hell is that?
Is that Gloria laughing?

1040
00:54:05,643 --> 00:54:08,476
She's still here
after he had a snap on her like that?

1041
00:54:08,646 --> 00:54:12,309
- She forgave him right away.
- You are my special lady.

1042
00:54:12,483 --> 00:54:14,849
And you are my one-footed
maize-covered lover.

1043
00:54:15,286 --> 00:54:17,186
Okay, come on,
we gotta go to sleep.

1044
00:54:17,355 --> 00:54:20,256
We're going to Milan tomorrow, right?
A long flight.

1045
00:54:20,424 --> 00:54:22,051
Let's get our rest.

1046
00:54:24,895 --> 00:54:27,659
Somebody kill that turkey.

1047
00:54:37,975 --> 00:54:40,341
Is that getting me horny?

1048
00:54:41,178 --> 00:54:42,406
Yes.

1049
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:45,715
You promise you'll still feed her
after we leave?

1050
00:54:45,883 --> 00:54:47,316
I promise.

1051
00:54:47,485 --> 00:54:49,112
Mommy, that's my milk.

1052
00:54:49,287 --> 00:54:52,154
Bean, we have to learn how to share,
even with birds.

1053
00:54:52,323 --> 00:54:54,814
But he's going to drink you dry.

1054
00:55:01,232 --> 00:55:02,597
This is good.

1055
00:55:11,742 --> 00:55:13,676
I got it three times.

1056
00:55:13,844 --> 00:55:16,005
Donna, you wanna try?

1057
00:55:16,614 --> 00:55:18,673
Sure. But I stink at sports.

1058
00:55:18,849 --> 00:55:20,544
That's all right. Here.

1059
00:55:20,718 --> 00:55:22,845
- Hold it like this.
- Like this?

1060
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:26,478
Get down low and throw it,
and let the rock do the magic.

1061
00:55:27,958 --> 00:55:29,220
- Nice.
- Oh, I skipped it.

1062
00:55:29,727 --> 00:55:32,321
- Good job, Donna.
- Bravo.

1063
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:34,054
Do you know how to skip rocks?

1064
00:55:34,231 --> 00:55:36,392
Are you kidding me?
I am the best at this.

1065
00:55:37,335 --> 00:55:40,099
Give me that. Now, watch, now.

1066
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:46,867
Oh, my God, baby, are you okay?

1067
00:55:47,044 --> 00:55:50,741
Yeah, Mom, I'm just glad to see you
having some fun.

1068
00:55:51,682 --> 00:55:53,775
I'll take your luggage to the car,
Mr. Feder.

1069
00:55:53,951 --> 00:55:55,851
That's not my luggage,
that's textbooks.

1070
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:58,147
That's nice of you to take your
own stuff down.

1071
00:55:58,322 --> 00:55:59,346
You're okay. Come on.

1072
00:55:59,523 --> 00:56:01,548
Come on, man.
Already? You're leaving?

1073
00:56:01,726 --> 00:56:02,886
Yes, I gotta go.

1074
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:05,051
Do you need any help getting
to the airport?

1075
00:56:05,229 --> 00:56:06,389
We got a little problem.

1076
00:56:06,564 --> 00:56:07,792
What? What happened?

1077
00:56:07,965 --> 00:56:10,399
I forgot how to skip a rock.

1078
00:56:10,634 --> 00:56:14,263
Now, I think it's gonna take
a couple of days to figure it out.

1079
00:56:14,538 --> 00:56:15,698
So...

1080
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:17,903
...I think we better stay.

1081
00:56:18,075 --> 00:56:19,235
Are you kidding me?

1082
00:56:19,410 --> 00:56:22,038
For reals, Mom? We're not leaving?

1083
00:56:22,213 --> 00:56:26,206
I don't need to see a bunch of starving
models walking around in my clothes.

1084
00:56:26,384 --> 00:56:29,217
Yeah, why would you wanna see
models when you can see this?

1085
00:56:30,388 --> 00:56:33,915
See? You couldn't get that in Milan.

1086
00:56:35,459 --> 00:56:36,483
You.

1087
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:37,888
You.

1088
00:56:38,462 --> 00:56:40,259
What do you wanna do today?
Anything.

1089
00:56:40,431 --> 00:56:41,898
I don't know. You tell me.

1090
00:56:42,066 --> 00:56:45,729
What was your favorite thing to do
when you were 12 and it was sunny?

1091
00:56:46,904 --> 00:56:47,996
Well, I can't do that.

1092
00:56:49,607 --> 00:56:52,269
Maybe go to a water park.

1093
00:56:52,443 --> 00:56:53,671
What are we waiting for?

1094
00:56:53,844 --> 00:56:55,869
- Seriously?
- Let's load up the car, people.

1095
00:56:56,046 --> 00:56:57,070
Are you kidding me?

1096
00:56:57,248 --> 00:57:00,684
- I'm not taking my shirt off.
- I'm not taking my shirt off either.

1097
00:57:04,355 --> 00:57:05,686
You're wasting it.

1098
00:57:06,157 --> 00:57:07,181
Sorry.

1099
00:57:08,926 --> 00:57:10,416
It's all right.

1100
00:57:11,328 --> 00:57:13,063
It's actually not that bad.

1101
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:24,268
- Ladies' day.
- All right? You're in charge.

1102
00:57:28,078 --> 00:57:29,568
I have to go number two.

1103
00:57:29,747 --> 00:57:31,214
Okay, hang on, son.

1104
00:57:31,482 --> 00:57:32,506
Hey, Dad.

1105
00:57:32,683 --> 00:57:34,514
Hey. Where you guys been?

1106
00:57:34,685 --> 00:57:38,314
Well, we didn't bring our swimsuits, so
Marcus went to take us to buy some.

1107
00:57:41,325 --> 00:57:43,452
We got them at a store
called Naughty and Nice.

1108
00:57:43,627 --> 00:57:45,652
Marcus said
it was the only one open.

1109
00:57:45,830 --> 00:57:49,459
The only place open?
For bathing suits? In the summer?

1110
00:57:50,301 --> 00:57:53,168
We got my bathing suit
at Stop and Shop.

1111
00:57:53,771 --> 00:57:55,864
Now, that's... I like that one.

1112
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:57,735
Let's hit the water slide.

1113
00:57:57,908 --> 00:57:59,239
Water slide.

1114
00:58:06,851 --> 00:58:08,045
What a beautiful day.

1115
00:58:08,219 --> 00:58:10,915
- God. It's a girls' day.
- I know.

1116
00:58:11,088 --> 00:58:13,215
It is hot.

1117
00:58:13,390 --> 00:58:14,652
Oh, boy.

1118
00:58:14,825 --> 00:58:17,259
- Are we really doing bathing suits?
- God, it's hot.

1119
00:58:17,428 --> 00:58:19,988
Come on, girls. We don't know
these people. Who cares?

1120
00:58:20,164 --> 00:58:24,123
You're right, who cares? I've been
working all summer on this six-pack.

1121
00:58:24,301 --> 00:58:25,325
All right.

1122
00:58:25,503 --> 00:58:27,095
How do you feel about that?

1123
00:58:27,271 --> 00:58:31,332
- Baby got front.
- Go, D. Go, D.

1124
00:58:31,509 --> 00:58:33,500
Come on, Sally, it's your turn.
Take it off.

1125
00:58:33,677 --> 00:58:35,645
Oh, no.
I have a bit of a chill, actually.

1126
00:58:35,813 --> 00:58:36,837
Gloria, how about you?

1127
00:58:37,014 --> 00:58:39,881
I don't own a bathing suit.
But I like to go nude.

1128
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:42,541
- No, no, no.
- There's children here.

1129
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:45,848
Hey, somebody likes what he sees.

1130
00:59:02,773 --> 00:59:04,900
- Daddy, this line's not even moving.
- I know.

1131
00:59:05,075 --> 00:59:08,408
- I know.
- I want Mommy's milk.

1132
00:59:08,579 --> 00:59:10,069
I know you do, son, but...

1133
00:59:10,247 --> 00:59:12,807
He wants mommy's milk.
Give him some mommy's milk.

1134
00:59:12,983 --> 00:59:14,712
Mommy's milk! Mommy's milk!

1135
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:16,318
No. No. Damn it.

1136
00:59:16,487 --> 00:59:17,977
No more Mommy's milk, okay?

1137
00:59:18,155 --> 00:59:20,419
You want milk,
you're drinking regular milk.

1138
00:59:20,591 --> 00:59:22,650
- Here, kid.
- Hey.

1139
00:59:22,826 --> 00:59:26,057
Don't give me any guff right now.
Here's a buck. Run along. Run along.

1140
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:28,061
Here.
Drink the milk out of the carton.

1141
00:59:28,232 --> 00:59:30,826
I don't know if Mommy
will want me to.

1142
00:59:31,001 --> 00:59:34,937
All right, just drink it, okay? Just like
Daddy does. Let me show you, okay?

1143
00:59:35,105 --> 00:59:37,300
Okay.

1144
00:59:40,578 --> 00:59:42,068
I'm just like Daddy.

1145
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:44,440
There you go.

1146
00:59:44,615 --> 00:59:45,673
No more booby milk.

1147
00:59:46,483 --> 00:59:48,678
More for us.

1148
00:59:48,852 --> 00:59:51,946
So, ladies, how do we get
Mr. Banana Hammock...

1149
00:59:52,122 --> 00:59:55,182
...to come over here, where we can get
a better look at him?

1150
00:59:55,359 --> 00:59:58,795
Okay. Well, there's two big
advantages to breast-feeding...

1151
00:59:58,996 --> 01:00:01,123
...and I'm gonna put mine to work.

1152
01:00:01,298 --> 01:00:02,595
Sally.

1153
01:00:03,767 --> 01:00:05,428
That's it, girl.

1154
01:00:05,603 --> 01:00:06,865
Oh, my goodness.

1155
01:00:07,037 --> 01:00:10,404
- Work that umbrella pole, baby.
- Sally. Oh, my God.

1156
01:00:10,574 --> 01:00:13,236
- Oh, it's definitely working. Yeah.
- You're good at that.

1157
01:00:13,410 --> 01:00:16,311
- Oh, my God, he likes it.
- Look at him flex.

1158
01:00:16,513 --> 01:00:18,378
No, continue.

1159
01:00:19,183 --> 01:00:22,118
All right, doing the back-door shuffle.
Cutting the line. Go.

1160
01:00:22,286 --> 01:00:23,310
Don't get hurt.

1161
01:00:23,487 --> 01:00:24,511
Go, go, go.

1162
01:00:24,688 --> 01:00:26,679
Dad, are we allowed
to go through here?

1163
01:00:27,091 --> 01:00:29,116
Absolutely not,
but we're doing it anyway.

1164
01:00:29,293 --> 01:00:31,955
All right, your cool dad found this
back in the day.

1165
01:00:33,664 --> 01:00:35,427
Go up the ladder.

1166
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:38,329
It's dark in there.
Maybe you should hold my hand.

1167
01:00:38,535 --> 01:00:39,729
I'm scared.

1168
01:00:39,903 --> 01:00:41,768
Hey. Come here, come here.

1169
01:00:41,939 --> 01:00:44,305
Don't fall for that crap.
You stay away from him.

1170
01:00:44,475 --> 01:00:46,705
What are you talking about?
He's gay, isn't he?

1171
01:00:46,877 --> 01:00:48,606
No. He just seems gay.

1172
01:00:48,779 --> 01:00:50,076
He's a genius.

1173
01:00:50,247 --> 01:00:51,646
Go, go, go.

1174
01:00:54,018 --> 01:00:56,043
Alrighty, who's next?

1175
01:00:57,221 --> 01:00:58,313
All right, who's next?

1176
01:00:58,489 --> 01:01:00,923
Now's a good time. Charlotte.

1177
01:01:01,091 --> 01:01:02,922
You're up first.

1178
01:01:03,093 --> 01:01:06,324
- There you go.
- Have fun, Charlotte.

1179
01:01:06,497 --> 01:01:10,763
There you go. Who's next? Go.

1180
01:01:13,537 --> 01:01:16,506
- Is he coming this way?
- He's coming towards us right now.

1181
01:01:20,944 --> 01:01:22,104
- This is good now.
- He is.

1182
01:01:22,279 --> 01:01:24,008
Whatever you do, don't fart.

1183
01:01:30,788 --> 01:01:32,278
Hey, what's up, ladies?

1184
01:01:32,790 --> 01:01:34,553
So you're from around
these parts, eh?

1185
01:01:35,693 --> 01:01:39,254
Yeah, I'm from Saskatchetoon.
That's up in Canada, eh?

1186
01:01:40,898 --> 01:01:43,867
You American ladies,
you've been out to Saskatchetoon, eh?

1187
01:01:51,241 --> 01:01:52,469
Hoseteasers.

1188
01:01:57,214 --> 01:02:01,116
Everything was on steroids
except for his voice.

1189
01:02:02,352 --> 01:02:03,478
Go, go, go.

1190
01:02:03,654 --> 01:02:04,882
Out, out, out.

1191
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:06,784
Now, now, now.

1192
01:02:14,565 --> 01:02:15,589
Next.

1193
01:02:37,521 --> 01:02:40,422
All right, who's next?
Hey, weren't you guys just here?

1194
01:02:40,591 --> 01:02:43,992
No. I think you have us confused
with some other people.

1195
01:02:44,161 --> 01:02:48,359
I don't think so, you're two of the
hottest chicks I've ever seen in my life.

1196
01:02:48,532 --> 01:02:49,931
- Hey.
- What?

1197
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:52,227
- These are my daughters.
- Right.

1198
01:02:52,402 --> 01:02:53,926
Her, definitely.

1199
01:02:54,104 --> 01:02:56,470
Because she's fugly, just like you.

1200
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:58,130
- Hey.
- Now, who's next?

1201
01:03:26,870 --> 01:03:30,169
Dad. Come on. Hurry up,
I wanna go to Pirate's Plunge.

1202
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:33,571
One second. Yeah, we're going
on all the rides. We're doing them all.

1203
01:03:33,744 --> 01:03:34,802
We'll have fun.

1204
01:03:35,813 --> 01:03:37,303
Are you making a sissy?

1205
01:03:38,715 --> 01:03:39,739
No, I'm not.

1206
01:03:39,917 --> 01:03:42,886
You know they put a chemical
in the pool that turns urine blue.

1207
01:03:43,053 --> 01:03:46,784
No, no, no, that's an old wives' tale,
sweetie. That's an old wives' tale.

1208
01:03:46,957 --> 01:03:49,482
Oh, my God.
You're humiliating me.

1209
01:04:12,015 --> 01:04:13,346
Mama, Mama.

1210
01:04:13,517 --> 01:04:14,882
Wanna take a picture?

1211
01:04:15,052 --> 01:04:17,282
All right. A little farther.

1212
01:04:17,888 --> 01:04:18,912
Farther.

1213
01:04:19,089 --> 01:04:20,886
Farther.

1214
01:04:24,862 --> 01:04:26,386
Gotcha.

1215
01:04:44,281 --> 01:04:46,715
I don't know about this one, Dad.
It's kind of steep.

1216
01:04:46,884 --> 01:04:48,715
It's a little steeper than I remember.

1217
01:04:48,886 --> 01:04:50,353
Okay, let's go on another ride.

1218
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:53,421
- I don't like it either, yeah.
- Come on, we'll get out of here.

1219
01:04:53,590 --> 01:04:57,253
Good thing the kid chickened out
so you don't have to go, right, Feder?

1220
01:04:57,427 --> 01:05:01,158
Why don't you hire somebody
to do it for you, Mr. Richie Rich?

1221
01:05:01,331 --> 01:05:03,925
Good idea.
Hey, Wiley, what's up, man?

1222
01:05:04,101 --> 01:05:06,501
- Step aside. Let me get this on.
- All right, son.

1223
01:05:08,272 --> 01:05:10,570
Hasta la vista, chicken shiznit.

1224
01:05:10,741 --> 01:05:12,402
Yeah, look at him go.

1225
01:05:13,977 --> 01:05:15,171
Go, kid.

1226
01:05:18,615 --> 01:05:20,515
That was good. That was very nice.

1227
01:05:20,684 --> 01:05:22,311
All right, now I want some of this.

1228
01:05:22,486 --> 01:05:24,113
Look at this. Look at this.

1229
01:05:24,288 --> 01:05:26,756
- What happened there?
- Attaboy. Way to go, Greggie.

1230
01:05:26,924 --> 01:05:28,949
Backwards, huh? Look at him.

1231
01:05:32,129 --> 01:05:33,994
Backwards, baby.

1232
01:05:38,936 --> 01:05:40,198
You're up, Hollywood.

1233
01:05:40,370 --> 01:05:43,271
I'm up? All right. I don't know how
you follow backwards.

1234
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:46,204
Just pay attention to the dismount,
would you?

1235
01:06:02,359 --> 01:06:04,623
Looks like second place again,
Bailey, huh?

1236
01:06:05,128 --> 01:06:07,688
- Hear this guy? Second place.
- Second place.

1237
01:06:08,065 --> 01:06:09,692
Go down there hanging by your feet.

1238
01:06:09,866 --> 01:06:11,424
Show these idiots.

1239
01:06:11,601 --> 01:06:12,625
By my feet?

1240
01:06:13,103 --> 01:06:14,127
Yeah.

1241
01:06:14,838 --> 01:06:15,862
Is that safe?

1242
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:19,138
What do you care? You're an animal.
You're an animal.

1243
01:06:19,843 --> 01:06:21,071
I'm an animal.

1244
01:06:22,312 --> 01:06:23,711
Wiley.

1245
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:27,179
- Why don't you do it?
- I got kids.

1246
01:06:27,351 --> 01:06:28,818
Yeah, Wiley.

1247
01:06:28,986 --> 01:06:32,149
<i>Wiley, Wiley, Wiley.</i>

1248
01:06:34,725 --> 01:06:36,522
Oh, you don't need to do this.

1249
01:06:40,030 --> 01:06:41,224
I'm an animal.

1250
01:06:42,165 --> 01:06:43,826
I'm an animal.

1251
01:06:44,001 --> 01:06:45,093
Yeah.

1252
01:06:45,268 --> 01:06:47,099
I can't get my foot out.

1253
01:06:54,378 --> 01:06:55,572
That's how you do it, boy.

1254
01:06:55,746 --> 01:06:57,680
- Becky.
- You can do this.

1255
01:06:57,881 --> 01:07:00,281
- Good. There you go.
- Give me a five.

1256
01:07:01,518 --> 01:07:04,214
Roxanne, look at him.
It's like he totally forgot about me.

1257
01:07:04,388 --> 01:07:05,412
Typical man.

1258
01:07:05,589 --> 01:07:09,047
They take all you can give and then
they trade you in for some cow.

1259
01:07:09,226 --> 01:07:11,626
I don't know what I'm
supposed to do with these now.

1260
01:07:11,795 --> 01:07:13,262
I do.

1261
01:07:15,098 --> 01:07:17,566
Now, see that, buddy?

1262
01:07:17,734 --> 01:07:21,135
I did the old bank shot.
Bank's open. Pick a spot. Aim for it.

1263
01:07:21,304 --> 01:07:24,034
Oh, yeah. Your dad'll go
50 for 50 with these.

1264
01:07:24,207 --> 01:07:26,801
Really? Because on the Wii,
the bank shot never works.

1265
01:07:27,477 --> 01:07:29,968
Yeah? Well, you should Wii-turn
it and get a Wii-fund.

1266
01:07:30,147 --> 01:07:33,207
Tim Duncan's had about a hundred
game winners with that bad boy.

1267
01:07:33,383 --> 01:07:35,317
Honey, are you watching me?

1268
01:07:35,485 --> 01:07:38,283
Oh, baby, that was hot.

1269
01:07:38,455 --> 01:07:41,356
- Come here, let me show you.
- Way to go, baby.

1270
01:07:41,525 --> 01:07:44,460
Move it, move it, move it.
What you gotta do is...

1271
01:07:44,628 --> 01:07:47,290
See the box up there?
Top right corner of it?

1272
01:07:47,464 --> 01:07:48,897
Hello?

1273
01:07:49,433 --> 01:07:51,333
Focus, boy, focus. Get off of that.

1274
01:07:51,501 --> 01:07:52,798
Lamonsoff, focus.

1275
01:07:55,205 --> 01:07:57,503
Oh, my God, what a perv.

1276
01:07:57,707 --> 01:07:59,641
He's totally checking me out.

1277
01:07:59,810 --> 01:08:01,573
He wasn't... I don't know.

1278
01:08:01,745 --> 01:08:03,337
All right, come on. Go ahead.

1279
01:08:04,147 --> 01:08:05,876
Follow through. Keep the hand up.

1280
01:08:06,049 --> 01:08:07,516
Are you kidding me?

1281
01:08:07,684 --> 01:08:09,015
Respect.

1282
01:08:09,186 --> 01:08:11,677
See how good you can be when
you wear normal clothes?

1283
01:08:11,855 --> 01:08:13,482
- Hey, Mama.
- Hey, baby.

1284
01:08:13,657 --> 01:08:15,921
How come you're not
out there playing basketball?

1285
01:08:16,093 --> 01:08:19,358
- You know I got...
- You got bunions. Where's Kurt?

1286
01:08:19,529 --> 01:08:20,621
Come on, are you scared?

1287
01:08:20,797 --> 01:08:22,628
What's wrong with you?

1288
01:08:23,667 --> 01:08:25,032
Stop it.

1289
01:08:26,169 --> 01:08:28,228
Somebody's in trouble.

1290
01:08:28,405 --> 01:08:30,107
Not looking good.

1291
01:08:33,610 --> 01:08:35,237
I do the same thing.

1292
01:08:37,314 --> 01:08:40,647
All right, I did everybody's first shot
for them.

1293
01:08:40,817 --> 01:08:42,478
Now you do the second one.

1294
01:08:42,652 --> 01:08:44,347
Come on, now.

1295
01:08:44,521 --> 01:08:45,852
No, nobody's doing shots.

1296
01:08:46,323 --> 01:08:48,985
We got kids here, dummy.
Gotta wake up in the morning.

1297
01:08:49,159 --> 01:08:52,458
We're gonna biz beers instead.
Who's got beers? Check them off.

1298
01:08:52,629 --> 01:08:55,393
- I'm gonna go with one.
- Yeah, I'll stick with coffee.

1299
01:08:55,565 --> 01:08:56,964
- I'm having this many.
- Cheers.

1300
01:08:57,134 --> 01:09:00,900
- I'm breast-feeding, I don't drink.
- I'm just having Metamucil tonight.

1301
01:09:01,071 --> 01:09:02,698
What's wrong with you guys?

1302
01:09:02,906 --> 01:09:07,673
We used to come up here and party,
man, and get wasted.

1303
01:09:07,844 --> 01:09:09,141
You losers.

1304
01:09:09,312 --> 01:09:12,748
Don't worry, you'll grow up one day.
You just have to meet the right girl.

1305
01:09:12,916 --> 01:09:16,147
Oh, my older sister
would be perfect for you.

1306
01:09:17,187 --> 01:09:18,279
What?

1307
01:09:18,455 --> 01:09:22,391
She's legally blind,
but she can see shapes.

1308
01:09:22,826 --> 01:09:25,989
Anyways, Roxanne,
how did you and Lenny meet?

1309
01:09:26,163 --> 01:09:27,460
That's a good question.

1310
01:09:27,631 --> 01:09:30,566
How did this blob of crap,
no offense...

1311
01:09:31,067 --> 01:09:34,002
...meet this lovely señorita?

1312
01:09:34,171 --> 01:09:37,766
Oh, he came into the department store
where I was working.

1313
01:09:37,941 --> 01:09:39,101
I helped him.

1314
01:09:39,276 --> 01:09:41,574
He wanted me to try this skirt on.

1315
01:09:41,745 --> 01:09:44,179
Oh, the old "try on the skirt" trick.

1316
01:09:44,347 --> 01:09:46,076
I got you. Very sneaky, sis.

1317
01:09:46,249 --> 01:09:49,685
Yeah, he did trick me. Afterwards
he made me try on a bra and...

1318
01:09:49,853 --> 01:09:52,117
Hey, I was just trying to help.

1319
01:09:52,289 --> 01:09:55,019
- Exactly.
- Okay, okay. I did like him a little.

1320
01:09:55,192 --> 01:09:57,126
It was a good day.

1321
01:09:57,294 --> 01:10:00,024
Oh, God! Oh, my water.
My water's breaking.

1322
01:10:00,197 --> 01:10:01,357
The baby's coming!

1323
01:10:01,531 --> 01:10:05,433
- Are you serious?
- Oh, yeah.

1324
01:10:05,602 --> 01:10:06,796
Oh, you.

1325
01:10:07,337 --> 01:10:08,531
Oh, my God.

1326
01:10:08,705 --> 01:10:10,832
I got you, I got you, I got you.

1327
01:10:11,007 --> 01:10:12,497
All right.

1328
01:10:12,676 --> 01:10:14,439
I'm just playing.

1329
01:10:16,246 --> 01:10:18,111
Oh, my God, it's...

1330
01:10:18,715 --> 01:10:22,378
Do you know this song?
Oh, this song's the best.

1331
01:10:24,254 --> 01:10:25,949
This song is the best.

1332
01:10:28,758 --> 01:10:31,784
Oh, this song gets me so horny.

1333
01:10:32,629 --> 01:10:35,257
You know, I was thinking that,
but now not so much.

1334
01:10:35,432 --> 01:10:37,024
I'd like to claim credit for that.

1335
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:40,363
Because that's all part of my
"get some nookie" playlist.

1336
01:10:40,537 --> 01:10:43,506
Get the ladies on the dance floor,
and I got my lady right here.

1337
01:10:43,673 --> 01:10:45,140
Come on, honey.

1338
01:10:45,342 --> 01:10:47,572
- That was a really good move.
- Let's do this.

1339
01:10:47,744 --> 01:10:49,211
Yeah, you guys dance.

1340
01:10:49,379 --> 01:10:51,847
- It has been a while.
- A long while.

1341
01:10:52,015 --> 01:10:53,710
I know how much you love to dance.

1342
01:10:53,883 --> 01:10:56,784
Oh, you know me,
I'm a regular Shabba-Doo.

1343
01:11:14,971 --> 01:11:16,734
Look at you.

1344
01:11:17,107 --> 01:11:19,632
All sexy. Deanne.

1345
01:11:19,809 --> 01:11:21,936
You should change your name
to Deyoncé.

1346
01:11:22,112 --> 01:11:23,136
Oh, God.

1347
01:11:23,313 --> 01:11:25,645
Yeah, so now he thinks
I'm sexy, huh?

1348
01:11:25,815 --> 01:11:28,978
Can I just enjoy a dance
with my fine-ass wife?

1349
01:11:29,953 --> 01:11:32,615
Yes. To the whitest song ever. Yes.

1350
01:11:32,789 --> 01:11:36,054
Yes, this is the whitest song
I've ever heard.

1351
01:11:36,593 --> 01:11:40,029
You know, Lenny, you were right
about bringing us here.

1352
01:11:40,196 --> 01:11:41,754
This place is really special.

1353
01:11:41,931 --> 01:11:43,592
It is, right?

1354
01:11:43,767 --> 01:11:47,066
Nothing's going on here,
and I love it.

1355
01:11:47,237 --> 01:11:50,695
Roxanne, I have made out with about
25 different girls in this very spot...

1356
01:11:50,874 --> 01:11:52,569
...and I want you to be number 26.

1357
01:11:53,009 --> 01:11:54,374
As long as I'm the last one.

1358
01:11:54,544 --> 01:11:56,637
Oh, that's a guarantee.

1359
01:11:57,514 --> 01:11:59,482
I'm horny too.

1360
01:11:59,816 --> 01:12:02,307
Hey, what are you doing? You idiot.

1361
01:12:14,864 --> 01:12:17,992
Lamonsoff. What are you doing up?

1362
01:12:20,236 --> 01:12:22,727
- I gotta tell you, it was crazy.
- What?

1363
01:12:22,906 --> 01:12:24,737
Sally. She just attacked me.

1364
01:12:24,908 --> 01:12:27,240
Like never before. It was insane.

1365
01:12:27,410 --> 01:12:29,503
I just did the same thing
with my woman.

1366
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:31,112
Really?

1367
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:38,984
Hey, where's Saskatchetoon?

1368
01:12:39,255 --> 01:12:41,849
Yeah. I don't know.

1369
01:12:53,436 --> 01:12:56,030
- What am I?
- A hoseteaser.

1370
01:12:56,206 --> 01:12:58,697
- And where are you from?
- Saskatchetoon.

1371
01:12:59,442 --> 01:13:01,103
Look at this.

1372
01:13:01,277 --> 01:13:02,608
- And what am I?
- A hoseteaser.

1373
01:13:02,779 --> 01:13:05,543
- And where are you from?
- Saskatchetoon.

1374
01:13:06,616 --> 01:13:08,208
What are we gonna do
with Higgins?

1375
01:13:08,385 --> 01:13:11,252
Yeah, and you know what?
This is what pisses me off:

1376
01:13:11,421 --> 01:13:15,289
You can't be passed-out drunk, single,
with no responsibility and not pay.

1377
01:13:15,458 --> 01:13:16,789
You have to be hurt for that.

1378
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,757
Yeah.

1379
01:13:19,562 --> 01:13:21,462
Sweetheart?

1380
01:13:21,631 --> 01:13:24,395
You fell asleep on the couch again.

1381
01:13:25,301 --> 01:13:27,667
You know you supposed
to go to your room.

1382
01:13:27,837 --> 01:13:29,304
You're bad.

1383
01:13:29,472 --> 01:13:30,496
No.

1384
01:13:31,374 --> 01:13:33,069
Marcus, the bird is all better.

1385
01:13:33,243 --> 01:13:36,371
Marcus. He wants to talk to you.

1386
01:13:40,116 --> 01:13:44,109
Marcus, you're gonna be the best
lifeguard at the whole pool.

1387
01:13:44,287 --> 01:13:45,584
Hold your breath, honey.

1388
01:13:45,755 --> 01:13:47,950
Hold your breath, honey.

1389
01:13:51,628 --> 01:13:52,788
Who's that?

1390
01:13:52,962 --> 01:13:55,430
Oh, it's mommy's boyfriend.

1391
01:13:55,598 --> 01:13:57,031
The one who touches you.

1392
01:14:01,504 --> 01:14:02,801
He's crying, he's crying.

1393
01:14:05,842 --> 01:14:07,639
- All right, quiet.
- Hi, Mama.

1394
01:14:07,811 --> 01:14:10,006
- All right. It's all right.
- Mama?

1395
01:14:10,213 --> 01:14:13,478
- Okay, baby. It's okay, precious.
- Mama?

1396
01:14:13,650 --> 01:14:15,174
I'm gonna take you upstairs.

1397
01:14:15,351 --> 01:14:19,048
Go and put your PJ's on, okay?
You can't fall asleep...

1398
01:14:19,222 --> 01:14:21,816
You can't just sleep anywhere,
you know that.

1399
01:14:21,991 --> 01:14:23,219
You go to your room.

1400
01:14:23,393 --> 01:14:25,384
- Go to sleep.
- You go to your room.

1401
01:14:25,562 --> 01:14:27,792
- What you doing?
- Come here.

1402
01:14:27,964 --> 01:14:31,127
This isn't a closet.
This is your bedroom.

1403
01:14:31,301 --> 01:14:35,397
Okay? It's also your bathroom.
You can make a pee-pee.

1404
01:14:36,105 --> 01:14:38,767
I'm making a pee-pee.

1405
01:14:42,645 --> 01:14:45,113
Happy Fourth of July, everyone.

1406
01:14:46,749 --> 01:14:50,344
It's the birdy's Independence Day too,
so keep your fingers crossed, honey.

1407
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:52,112
- She did it, Daddy.
- Here we go.

1408
01:14:52,288 --> 01:14:53,949
- Bye, birdy.
- She's flying.

1409
01:14:54,123 --> 01:14:57,183
She's gonna be a veterinarian.
Is this girl incredible or what?

1410
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:05,925
That's so sexy. What did you say?

1411
01:15:06,102 --> 01:15:07,569
Oh, I think that she said:

1412
01:15:09,072 --> 01:15:10,664
Milan.

1413
01:15:11,774 --> 01:15:14,675
You know, these guys at the store
were talking so much smack...

1414
01:15:14,844 --> 01:15:17,506
...about this basketball rematch
that's supposed to go on.

1415
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:19,978
Well, I'm glad we're getting
these uniforms ready.

1416
01:15:20,149 --> 01:15:23,084
No more drinkie.

1417
01:15:23,953 --> 01:15:26,683
Did you really sleep in the closet,
you drunk?

1418
01:15:29,092 --> 01:15:30,855
Think so.

1419
01:15:33,096 --> 01:15:34,859
No.

1420
01:15:35,632 --> 01:15:37,600
Oh, God, Higgins.

1421
01:15:37,767 --> 01:15:40,327
- That's disgusting.
- You slob.

1422
01:15:41,905 --> 01:15:47,343
Oh, I had the sexiest dream
about a little blond girl, though.

1423
01:15:51,114 --> 01:15:52,911
I think it was a dream.

1424
01:15:53,082 --> 01:15:55,642
- Oh, nice. Classy.
- Sick.

1425
01:15:57,820 --> 01:16:01,415
These deviled eggs would really be
good if you had some marinara sauce.

1426
01:16:01,591 --> 01:16:02,785
Oh, it's Lenny's phone.

1427
01:16:02,959 --> 01:16:03,983
Hello?

1428
01:16:04,394 --> 01:16:05,759
All right, here we go.

1429
01:16:05,929 --> 01:16:07,089
Oh, that's a three.

1430
01:16:07,263 --> 01:16:10,130
That's one, two, three, ladder.
Ladder.

1431
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:13,269
Oh, that's it.
The rich keep getting richer.

1432
01:16:13,436 --> 01:16:15,461
All right. All right.
Schniggly is here.

1433
01:16:15,638 --> 01:16:18,232
So, come on, Robbie,
tell the man what's going on.

1434
01:16:18,408 --> 01:16:19,500
He doesn't care.

1435
01:16:19,676 --> 01:16:22,804
- Tell him.
- What are you talking about? Tell him.

1436
01:16:22,979 --> 01:16:25,504
Gloria and I are thinking
about having a baby.

1437
01:16:25,682 --> 01:16:26,740
How great is that?

1438
01:16:28,818 --> 01:16:30,183
That's great.

1439
01:16:30,353 --> 01:16:33,345
You know, the good news is she can't
get any more stretch marks.

1440
01:16:34,457 --> 01:16:35,981
- Boy, that's a good one.
- Come on.

1441
01:16:36,159 --> 01:16:40,118
You know, the good thing also is
Gloria and the kid can share diapers.

1442
01:16:40,296 --> 01:16:41,763
Man. You see, that's just ugly.

1443
01:16:41,931 --> 01:16:44,798
He doesn't get it. He's not
in a committed relationship.

1444
01:16:44,968 --> 01:16:47,937
He can't, because he can't stay
in a committed relationship.

1445
01:16:48,104 --> 01:16:50,971
Oh, look. He's just mad
because all the girls I go out with...

1446
01:16:51,140 --> 01:16:54,303
...are 70 to 80 years younger
than his wife.

1447
01:16:54,477 --> 01:16:55,569
Can't stop.

1448
01:16:55,745 --> 01:16:59,977
The last one I was with, she's blond,
she's tall, super hot. Not your type.

1449
01:17:00,149 --> 01:17:03,607
Me and blondie, we start going at it
and we're shaking the bed...

1450
01:17:03,786 --> 01:17:05,981
Shaking the bed?
What does shaking the bed mean?

1451
01:17:06,155 --> 01:17:09,147
I don't know, I just know wetting
the bed. I don't know...

1452
01:17:09,325 --> 01:17:11,384
And then, right at the "good part."
you know?

1453
01:17:11,561 --> 01:17:14,962
This picture behind, right on the wall,
falls and goes:

1454
01:17:15,498 --> 01:17:16,795
Hits her on the forehead.

1455
01:17:16,966 --> 01:17:18,126
She cut her head.

1456
01:17:18,301 --> 01:17:19,928
It cuts her. I didn't slow down.

1457
01:17:20,103 --> 01:17:23,163
I just throw her two aspirins,
she yaps on them like a Frisbee dog.

1458
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:28,978
I am tired. Marcus, your snoring
kept me up all night long.

1459
01:17:33,316 --> 01:17:35,079
You're a dead man. Get back here.

1460
01:17:35,251 --> 01:17:39,312
Come back here. That's my baby girl.
I thought you were my friend.

1461
01:17:39,489 --> 01:17:41,184
Leave me alone. Drink your maize.

1462
01:17:41,357 --> 01:17:43,518
You're gonna pay this time.

1463
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:46,492
You bastard.
I'll show you how to be nice.

1464
01:17:46,663 --> 01:17:48,927
- Bad turtles.
- You evil pig.

1465
01:17:50,233 --> 01:17:51,860
- Robbie, wait.
- He's psycho.

1466
01:17:52,035 --> 01:17:53,297
Stop. Stop.

1467
01:17:53,469 --> 01:17:55,664
Hey, break it up, man. Jeez, guys.

1468
01:17:55,838 --> 01:17:56,964
- All right.
- Calm down.

1469
01:17:57,140 --> 01:17:59,040
Buddy. Buddy. What's the problem?

1470
01:18:02,712 --> 01:18:04,873
Oh, yeah. Arrow foot.

1471
01:18:05,048 --> 01:18:07,710
- Come here, baby.
- Come on. Why are you fighting?

1472
01:18:07,884 --> 01:18:09,579
Good to see midget wrestling again.

1473
01:18:09,752 --> 01:18:12,084
How could you do that?
That's my daughter.

1474
01:18:12,255 --> 01:18:14,723
- Do what?
- Shake the bed with her.

1475
01:18:14,891 --> 01:18:16,916
You think I would do that to you?

1476
01:18:17,293 --> 01:18:19,591
Out of any of us
you'd be the one to do that.

1477
01:18:19,762 --> 01:18:21,957
You did sleep
with Stimpson's mother.

1478
01:18:22,131 --> 01:18:25,362
I didn't even know that guy.
He was your friend. I barely knew him.

1479
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:27,765
She grabbed my wiener,
I told you guys.

1480
01:18:27,937 --> 01:18:30,201
- That's his daughter. It's different.
- Me and him?

1481
01:18:31,441 --> 01:18:35,036
Okay. Maybe I flirted with him,
but that was just to get your attention.

1482
01:18:35,211 --> 01:18:37,338
- Well, what about his snoring?
- I heard it too.

1483
01:18:41,951 --> 01:18:43,919
Oh, no. Twice?

1484
01:18:44,087 --> 01:18:45,952
We heard it from three rooms away.

1485
01:18:46,122 --> 01:18:49,580
He's off the hook. You know Marcus
wouldn't be with your daughter.

1486
01:18:49,759 --> 01:18:52,421
I mean, not that she's...
You know what I'm saying.

1487
01:18:53,262 --> 01:18:56,698
- Well, what happened to your head?
- When I was changing into my PJs...

1488
01:18:56,866 --> 01:18:59,994
...I got the feeling that some perv
was looking through my window...

1489
01:19:00,169 --> 01:19:04,037
...so I went to go close the shade
and I tripped and hit my head.

1490
01:19:04,574 --> 01:19:06,906
Yeah, dude, that's your daughter.

1491
01:19:07,076 --> 01:19:09,510
I'd never be with her.
You're my best friend, man.

1492
01:19:09,679 --> 01:19:12,147
And Jasmine'd never be with me,
because I'm me.

1493
01:19:12,548 --> 01:19:15,449
Look, sorry I don't have
my whole life together, like Lenny.

1494
01:19:15,618 --> 01:19:17,552
Oh, together, like Lenny.

1495
01:19:18,221 --> 01:19:19,245
Please.

1496
01:19:19,622 --> 01:19:21,419
<i>I answered your phone, hipócrita.</i>

1497
01:19:21,591 --> 01:19:22,819
It was your assistant.

1498
01:19:23,025 --> 01:19:25,960
I asked him if he canceled
the flight to Milan. He said he did.

1499
01:19:26,129 --> 01:19:27,994
Before we even came here.

1500
01:19:28,164 --> 01:19:30,962
He said that? Why would he say that?
I mean...

1501
01:19:31,134 --> 01:19:32,624
So he just made that up, huh?

1502
01:19:32,802 --> 01:19:34,394
I'm not saying he made it up.

1503
01:19:34,570 --> 01:19:37,266
I'm think...
In his head he believes it's true.

1504
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:38,998
Don't you agent me, Lenny.

1505
01:19:39,175 --> 01:19:41,609
Stop trying to handle
everybody and everything...

1506
01:19:41,778 --> 01:19:44,406
...and start taking a little
responsibility for once.

1507
01:19:44,580 --> 01:19:47,105
I'll take responsibility.
Okay? You're right.

1508
01:19:47,283 --> 01:19:50,810
I thought it would be better for our
family to be here with normal people...

1509
01:19:50,987 --> 01:19:52,750
...instead of going to Milan.

1510
01:19:52,922 --> 01:19:54,184
We're normal?

1511
01:19:54,357 --> 01:19:58,088
I was scared to tell you.
It was easier for me to keep it a secret.

1512
01:19:58,261 --> 01:20:01,094
You peel back any marriage,
there are secrets.

1513
01:20:01,497 --> 01:20:03,761
Mine is I love you.
I love you very much.

1514
01:20:03,933 --> 01:20:05,628
Roxanne, I just... I...

1515
01:20:05,802 --> 01:20:10,034
Our kids are becoming nutty,
snotty, spoiled...

1516
01:20:10,873 --> 01:20:13,433
- We got a nanny, we got...
- So she is a nanny.

1517
01:20:13,609 --> 01:20:15,008
No, no, no. She's not a nanny.

1518
01:20:15,178 --> 01:20:17,009
Of course she's a nanny.

1519
01:20:17,180 --> 01:20:19,205
When does the lying stop?

1520
01:20:19,382 --> 01:20:20,679
It stops right after this.

1521
01:20:20,850 --> 01:20:22,784
She's more of an au pair.
Not a nanny.

1522
01:20:22,952 --> 01:20:24,681
Lenny.

1523
01:20:25,388 --> 01:20:28,551
All right. That's it.
The lying stops now.

1524
01:20:28,724 --> 01:20:30,988
I won't lie to you ever again.
I swear to God.

1525
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:32,457
I love you.

1526
01:20:32,628 --> 01:20:34,118
Men lie.

1527
01:20:34,530 --> 01:20:36,464
They can't help themselves.

1528
01:20:36,632 --> 01:20:38,566
Kurt sure as hell lies.

1529
01:20:38,734 --> 01:20:41,225
What do I lie about,
Toe-J Simpson?

1530
01:20:41,404 --> 01:20:43,497
Oh, please. The nanny.

1531
01:20:43,873 --> 01:20:44,999
What about the nanny?

1532
01:20:45,174 --> 01:20:47,199
You have a thing for her.

1533
01:20:47,376 --> 01:20:51,369
I do not have a thing for the nanny.
I'm a married man. Period.

1534
01:20:51,814 --> 01:20:55,443
But did I enjoy a nice conversation
with a woman that wasn't going...

1535
01:20:55,618 --> 01:20:59,418
..."Where's this?" and
"Did you pick up that?" Yeah.

1536
01:20:59,589 --> 01:21:01,716
What, you can have
nice conversations with me.

1537
01:21:02,225 --> 01:21:04,056
When? You're always working.

1538
01:21:04,227 --> 01:21:06,923
And when you come home,
you're just tired all the time.

1539
01:21:07,129 --> 01:21:09,359
You barely even touch me
or look at me.

1540
01:21:09,532 --> 01:21:12,228
He sounds like an old woman.

1541
01:21:12,401 --> 01:21:16,667
Deanne, you should have married
Umberto Denunzio like I told you.

1542
01:21:16,839 --> 01:21:21,071
And if I had stayed with him you'd be
the one that's pregnant now, Mama.

1543
01:21:21,644 --> 01:21:23,771
You probably right, sweetheart.

1544
01:21:24,180 --> 01:21:25,670
I'll just butt out.

1545
01:21:25,848 --> 01:21:27,509
Thank you.

1546
01:21:27,683 --> 01:21:30,675
Look, maybe I do take you for granted,
and I'm sorry.

1547
01:21:31,187 --> 01:21:34,281
How's about I take you out every
Thursday night for date night.

1548
01:21:34,857 --> 01:21:38,623
<i>No, Thursday's Grey's Anatomy,
but any other night would be beautiful.</i>

1549
01:21:40,062 --> 01:21:45,659
And as long as we're all being honest,
I think I should be honest too.

1550
01:21:46,702 --> 01:21:50,934
I'm actually not a part owner
of the lawn furniture store.

1551
01:21:51,107 --> 01:21:54,042
I don't even work there anymore.

1552
01:21:54,210 --> 01:21:56,576
I got laid off in April.

1553
01:21:56,746 --> 01:21:58,543
But I rented the Caddy...

1554
01:21:58,714 --> 01:22:02,582
...and I acted like a big shot because
I didn't want you guys to know.

1555
01:22:02,752 --> 01:22:03,980
Lamonsoff.

1556
01:22:04,153 --> 01:22:06,781
You don't have to hide
anything from us. I'm sorry.

1557
01:22:06,956 --> 01:22:10,756
Yeah. Since we're getting things
off our chests here...

1558
01:22:10,927 --> 01:22:13,088
...I got a confession to make.

1559
01:22:15,264 --> 01:22:16,492
I'm wearing a toup.

1560
01:22:16,666 --> 01:22:17,997
No shit.

1561
01:22:20,303 --> 01:22:22,066
I have a confession to make.

1562
01:22:23,572 --> 01:22:24,971
I'm really a man.

1563
01:22:25,641 --> 01:22:27,802
- No.
- I said that.

1564
01:22:27,977 --> 01:22:32,573
- Are you kidding?
- No, I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding.

1565
01:22:32,748 --> 01:22:35,683
I'm really a little hurt that so many
of you believed it.

1566
01:22:35,851 --> 01:22:38,183
- We were just saying that...
- You're very womanly.

1567
01:22:38,354 --> 01:22:42,586
Nevertheless.
I know it's not my place, but...

1568
01:22:42,758 --> 01:22:45,522
Well, after all,
I am older than anyone here.

1569
01:22:45,695 --> 01:22:47,526
Hell, yeah, you are.

1570
01:22:49,332 --> 01:22:53,268
Well, despite the joking and
the razzing, I see a lot of love here.

1571
01:22:53,436 --> 01:22:56,462
And with love comes hostility.

1572
01:22:56,806 --> 01:23:00,765
Like Rob when he snapped at me
the other day.

1573
01:23:00,943 --> 01:23:02,103
That was scary.

1574
01:23:02,278 --> 01:23:05,179
And you all thought that I was so calm,
but inside?

1575
01:23:05,348 --> 01:23:06,975
Inside I was saying:

1576
01:23:07,149 --> 01:23:08,776
"Gloria Noonan...

1577
01:23:09,018 --> 01:23:12,886
...do not call him a bug-eyed sociopath
with a little-man complex.

1578
01:23:13,622 --> 01:23:17,649
Do not say that his hair makes him
look like a dirty Q-tip."

1579
01:23:17,827 --> 01:23:18,851
I like that.

1580
01:23:19,462 --> 01:23:23,228
"Or that he resembles an elder gay
Jonas brother."

1581
01:23:23,399 --> 01:23:26,391
They get it. They get the point
of where you're going.

1582
01:23:26,569 --> 01:23:29,129
"Or a midget Filipino Fonzie."
I didn't say those things.

1583
01:23:29,305 --> 01:23:31,569
- That's my favorite one.
- Hey.

1584
01:23:31,741 --> 01:23:33,038
Toupee.

1585
01:23:33,209 --> 01:23:35,700
Life can be difficult sometimes.

1586
01:23:35,878 --> 01:23:38,972
It gets bumpy,
what with family and kids...

1587
01:23:39,148 --> 01:23:42,140
...and things not going
exactly like you planned.

1588
01:23:42,318 --> 01:23:44,718
But that's what makes it interesting.

1589
01:23:44,887 --> 01:23:48,152
In life, the first act, always exciting.

1590
01:23:48,324 --> 01:23:50,417
The second act...

1591
01:23:50,860 --> 01:23:52,828
...that's where the depth comes in.

1592
01:23:54,530 --> 01:23:56,589
Why didn't you ever tell us
that she gets it?

1593
01:23:56,766 --> 01:23:58,256
Yeah, you were holding out.

1594
01:23:58,434 --> 01:24:00,698
That's what I've been trying
to tell you guys.

1595
01:24:00,870 --> 01:24:03,202
That was beautiful, honey.
That was beautiful.

1596
01:24:06,242 --> 01:24:07,607
Group hug.

1597
01:24:36,872 --> 01:24:38,271
Okay, it's in position.

1598
01:24:38,441 --> 01:24:40,341
I don't know, man.
This thing looks crazy.

1599
01:24:40,509 --> 01:24:43,273
It'll be fun. I spent all morning
blowing that thing up.

1600
01:24:43,446 --> 01:24:44,743
You should be all right.

1601
01:24:44,914 --> 01:24:47,405
- Should be?
- Yeah.

1602
01:24:48,951 --> 01:24:50,578
Ready?

1603
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:52,553
Go.

1604
01:25:00,396 --> 01:25:02,091
Let's do that again.

1605
01:25:02,264 --> 01:25:05,290
It's not a favor. It's like a great
investment for me, man.

1606
01:25:05,468 --> 01:25:06,958
A car detailing center.

1607
01:25:07,136 --> 01:25:09,400
And there's none around,
it's gonna be a goldmine.

1608
01:25:09,572 --> 01:25:11,130
I don't wanna take your money.

1609
01:25:11,307 --> 01:25:14,174
- You're making me more.
- I want in, okay?

1610
01:25:14,343 --> 01:25:17,278
I know the owner of the Celtics.
And I can get us that account.

1611
01:25:17,446 --> 01:25:19,812
Those guys all drive
Bentleys and Ferraris.

1612
01:25:19,982 --> 01:25:21,506
How do you know
the owner of the Celtics?

1613
01:25:21,684 --> 01:25:24,278
Hey, I'm the leader
of his daughter's Girl Scout troop.

1614
01:25:24,453 --> 01:25:27,183
If he wants to make sure
she gets her Cookie Biz badge...

1615
01:25:27,356 --> 01:25:28,846
...he will give us that account.

1616
01:25:30,559 --> 01:25:32,493
- I love you guys.
- I love it. I love it.

1617
01:25:35,364 --> 01:25:37,264
You ready to have some fun?

1618
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:38,994
Yeah. Hit it.

1619
01:25:43,205 --> 01:25:44,866
Okay.

1620
01:25:50,112 --> 01:25:52,205
Go. Go. You gotta get it in high.

1621
01:26:00,789 --> 01:26:02,620
You really wanna do this, Bailey?

1622
01:26:02,791 --> 01:26:04,452
My five against your five.

1623
01:26:04,627 --> 01:26:06,356
Oh, boy, look at this.

1624
01:26:06,529 --> 01:26:08,292
I see the boys
stayed in shape, huh?

1625
01:26:09,798 --> 01:26:11,288
Robideaux, good to see you.

1626
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:12,824
Lenny.

1627
01:26:13,002 --> 01:26:14,902
If you're looking at me, I don't know.

1628
01:26:18,207 --> 01:26:22,109
Look, we just wanna eat watermelon
and relax, if you're all right with that.

1629
01:26:22,278 --> 01:26:26,214
Oh, no. It's not all right. You're not
gonna weasel out of this one, Feder.

1630
01:26:26,382 --> 01:26:30,512
Wiley snuck out of intensive care
to see you finally get some justice.

1631
01:26:30,686 --> 01:26:33,712
Yo. You best be getting
to balling, Feder.

1632
01:26:33,889 --> 01:26:36,915
Oh, hey, Wiley.
Was the field goal good?

1633
01:26:37,393 --> 01:26:39,691
Yeah.
First time I ever heard that one.

1634
01:26:39,862 --> 01:26:41,853
Okay. Sorry, man.

1635
01:26:42,498 --> 01:26:46,332
Do you want me to get something off
the top shelf? Heard that one a lot too.

1636
01:26:47,336 --> 01:26:50,772
Seriously, Dickie, let us just hang out
with our families. We wanna relax.

1637
01:26:50,940 --> 01:26:53,704
Yeah. They're afraid of us.
That's what it is.

1638
01:26:53,876 --> 01:26:56,936
We're afraid you might eat the ball
before we even start the game.

1639
01:26:57,546 --> 01:27:01,676
Same old Higgins.
He can talk the talk but he can't...

1640
01:27:02,251 --> 01:27:04,276
I forget the rest.

1641
01:27:05,354 --> 01:27:09,017
We got Rob here with the bad foot.
You can't do it, right, buddy?

1642
01:27:10,226 --> 01:27:13,855
I think if the Buzzer was here,
he'd want me to try.

1643
01:27:14,396 --> 01:27:16,421
I think he'd want us all to try.

1644
01:27:17,199 --> 01:27:18,632
Was that William Shatner?

1645
01:27:20,069 --> 01:27:23,402
- All right, let's do this, then.
- It's on.

1646
01:27:24,607 --> 01:27:25,631
Game to 21.

1647
01:27:35,551 --> 01:27:36,643
Hey, hey. Okay, come on.

1648
01:27:44,360 --> 01:27:46,419
Guys! Look!

1649
01:28:25,801 --> 01:28:28,861
Well, well, well, if it isn't the other
black guy who grew up here.

1650
01:28:29,038 --> 01:28:32,496
No, no, no. In this town, I'm the black
guy and you're the other black guy.

1651
01:28:32,675 --> 01:28:34,540
No, man, in this town,
I'm the black guy.

1652
01:28:34,710 --> 01:28:37,270
White people see me coming
in their store, they get scared.

1653
01:28:37,446 --> 01:28:40,472
Yeah? When white people see me
coming into their store, they run.

1654
01:28:40,649 --> 01:28:42,981
Yeah, yeah. These my white people.
Go get your own.

1655
01:28:43,152 --> 01:28:44,983
You crazy, man.

1656
01:28:57,933 --> 01:28:59,798
Lucky shot.

1657
01:29:02,471 --> 01:29:04,166
<i>Defense, defense, defense.</i>

1658
01:29:09,244 --> 01:29:10,836
In your face.

1659
01:29:13,582 --> 01:29:16,016
Hey, guys. Motion '78.

1660
01:29:31,934 --> 01:29:33,333
<i>To me, man.</i>

1661
01:29:47,416 --> 01:29:50,180
Show me what you got. Say what?

1662
01:29:50,352 --> 01:29:53,287
Hey, Y! Where's M-C-A?

1663
01:30:01,397 --> 01:30:04,628
What the hell is that?
Sounds like owls having sex.

1664
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:06,233
Robideaux, heads up.

1665
01:30:09,571 --> 01:30:13,166
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Did that go in?

1666
01:30:30,125 --> 01:30:32,821
You made me spill
my freaking beer.

1667
01:30:32,995 --> 01:30:35,520
Honey, why does everything
always have to be about you?

1668
01:30:35,697 --> 01:30:37,756
Why do you always have to be
such a dink?

1669
01:30:49,611 --> 01:30:51,545
Get that. Yeah, yeah, right there.

1670
01:30:52,347 --> 01:30:53,905
I can't do this anymore.

1671
01:30:54,082 --> 01:30:55,276
I can't even breathe.

1672
01:30:55,451 --> 01:30:58,113
I haven't felt my legs
since the second quarter.

1673
01:30:58,287 --> 01:30:59,845
Hey, you wanna fake injuries?

1674
01:31:00,022 --> 01:31:01,256
- You got it.
- Okay.

1675
01:31:02,191 --> 01:31:03,351
- Oh, my...
- Oh, God!

1676
01:31:03,525 --> 01:31:05,584
I can't go on.
I got a slippery disk.

1677
01:31:05,761 --> 01:31:07,023
Oh, hon.

1678
01:31:07,196 --> 01:31:08,959
- Oh, it just slipped out.
- I'm done.

1679
01:31:09,131 --> 01:31:11,497
Somebody's gonna have
a heart attack.

1680
01:31:11,667 --> 01:31:13,191
What are you doing?

1681
01:31:13,368 --> 01:31:14,801
That's it?

1682
01:31:14,970 --> 01:31:16,494
Darth Vader, let's go. Sit down.

1683
01:31:16,672 --> 01:31:18,003
Please, honey.

1684
01:31:18,173 --> 01:31:20,107
Is that a cannoli from Virgilio's?

1685
01:31:22,044 --> 01:31:24,512
Did you seriously just take
your daughter's cannoli?

1686
01:31:24,680 --> 01:31:26,705
It's from Virgilio's. Leave me alone.

1687
01:31:26,882 --> 01:31:28,611
Don't choke, Daddy.

1688
01:31:29,051 --> 01:31:32,214
What do you say we bring my son
and your son into this?

1689
01:31:32,387 --> 01:31:34,048
- Done.
- Greggie.

1690
01:31:34,223 --> 01:31:36,817
- Me?
- Yeah. Go, Greg.

1691
01:31:36,992 --> 01:31:38,983
Come on, baby. You can do this.

1692
01:31:39,161 --> 01:31:40,219
Hey, Bailey.

1693
01:31:41,063 --> 01:31:45,397
Somebody fill up that jug with some
Boss water, for the Hollywood kid.

1694
01:31:45,567 --> 01:31:47,194
It's Voss, with a V.

1695
01:31:49,638 --> 01:31:53,972
Would you mind if I touch your belly?
I love babies. I love to feel them kick.

1696
01:31:54,142 --> 01:31:56,235
- Yeah, go ahead.
- Oh, thank you.

1697
01:32:00,582 --> 01:32:02,982
That's not my baby, that's my boob.

1698
01:32:03,151 --> 01:32:04,982
- Oh, I like to feel those too.
- Hey.

1699
01:32:05,153 --> 01:32:07,587
Hey, no harm done.

1700
01:32:07,756 --> 01:32:10,020
- All right, take it out. Come on.
- Sixteen to 16.

1701
01:32:10,192 --> 01:32:12,183
Half court, two on two. Let's go.

1702
01:32:13,695 --> 01:32:15,686
Keep your feet off the line this time.

1703
01:32:15,864 --> 01:32:18,765
It's tied score. Tied score.
Let's see something. Nice throw.

1704
01:32:18,934 --> 01:32:20,231
Tied score, guys.

1705
01:32:26,074 --> 01:32:28,042
All right, son. All right.

1706
01:32:28,210 --> 01:32:32,442
- We're up 19-16. Let's go.
- All right, son. Give me the ball.

1707
01:32:33,549 --> 01:32:36,074
- Come on, son.
- That's it, Greg. You can do it.

1708
01:32:36,251 --> 01:32:37,582
You know what's going on.

1709
01:32:43,225 --> 01:32:45,785
Oh, yes. It's raining threes
on Hollywood.

1710
01:32:45,961 --> 01:32:48,987
His foot was on the line.
Your foot was on the line.

1711
01:32:49,164 --> 01:32:50,927
It ain't raining threes.

1712
01:32:51,099 --> 01:32:54,091
- It's drizzling twos!
- That's all right. Good shot.

1713
01:32:54,269 --> 01:32:57,568
- Wasn't no three. Foot was on the line.
- Next basket wins. Let's go.

1714
01:32:58,073 --> 01:32:59,438
Come on.

1715
01:33:01,076 --> 01:33:02,202
This is it, pal.

1716
01:33:02,778 --> 01:33:04,871
Take him out, baby.

1717
01:33:06,048 --> 01:33:08,983
All right, all right, all right.
Take him, baby. Take him.

1718
01:33:13,889 --> 01:33:15,117
Pop it, Lenny.

1719
01:33:16,959 --> 01:33:19,052
Bank's open, Dad.

1720
01:33:45,153 --> 01:33:46,415
He never misses that shot.

1721
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:52,987
Down goes Hollywood.

1722
01:33:53,161 --> 01:33:54,822
Down goes Hollywood.

1723
01:33:54,997 --> 01:33:56,862
Down goes Hollywood.

1724
01:33:59,034 --> 01:34:03,300
We'll crush them next year. I'll work
on my left when we get back to L.A.

1725
01:34:03,472 --> 01:34:05,497
- That's my boy. I love you.
- I love you too.

1726
01:34:05,674 --> 01:34:06,698
You're awesome.

1727
01:34:08,010 --> 01:34:10,171
- Way to go!
- We did it!

1728
01:34:42,511 --> 01:34:44,069
Hey, Lenny.

1729
01:34:44,246 --> 01:34:46,680
I thought you never missed
a bank shot.

1730
01:34:46,848 --> 01:34:48,907
Yeah. Well, I just thought...

1731
01:34:49,351 --> 01:34:53,014
...the Baileys needed to learn how
to win every once in a while...

1732
01:34:53,188 --> 01:34:55,986
...and Feders needed to learn
how to lose.

1733
01:34:57,426 --> 01:34:58,723
- That was nice.
- Yeah?

1734
01:34:58,894 --> 01:35:00,828
I'm proud of you.

1735
01:35:01,797 --> 01:35:02,923
Look at these guys.

1736
01:35:07,402 --> 01:35:09,734
- Lenny. Hey, man.
- Yeah, buddy.

1737
01:35:09,905 --> 01:35:12,567
I know you're bummed about losing
the game for us.

1738
01:35:12,741 --> 01:35:13,765
And you're drunk?

1739
01:35:13,942 --> 01:35:16,672
- No. Yes.
- Oh, okay.

1740
01:35:16,845 --> 01:35:19,279
Hey, man, there's one thing
they'll never beat us at.

1741
01:35:19,448 --> 01:35:21,245
What's this?

1742
01:35:21,950 --> 01:35:24,783
Arrow roulette, baby.

1743
01:35:24,953 --> 01:35:26,443
- We are good at that.
- Yeah.

1744
01:35:26,621 --> 01:35:28,179
- All right.
- What are you doing?

1745
01:35:28,356 --> 01:35:30,449
- Last one to stay in wins.
- No, no, no.

1746
01:35:30,625 --> 01:35:32,286
Becky.

1747
01:35:34,362 --> 01:35:37,092
Run away. Not again.

1748
01:35:37,833 --> 01:35:39,596
Get out of my way.

1749
01:35:57,786 --> 01:36:00,380
Little help here? Take me with you?

1750
01:36:00,555 --> 01:36:03,115
Seriously, you're gonna leave me?

1751
01:36:03,291 --> 01:36:04,383
No.

1752
01:36:09,798 --> 01:36:12,062
We win again.
